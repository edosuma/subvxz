- How's the old lady?
Good. Vince!
- Fred: Great.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.666
How do you do? Dr. Jerry Buss.
Coming out with us tonight?

09:57.750 --> 09:59.375
I don't know.
I'll have to see, Jerry.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.583
You ever had a blow job
with champagne in her mouth?

10:01.666 --> 10:03.333
You're going to love it.
Mr. McComb!

10:03.416 --> 10:05.000
Welcome to Los Angeles, partner.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.500
Texas is bigger,
but we're more fun.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.625
- Welcome to the club.
- Oh, thank you.
It's a great honor.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.208
Hey, I want you to know
I voted for you.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.833
Thank you, Bill.
I appreciate that. I really do.

10:11.916 --> 10:13.666
- He didn't.
- He didn't vote for me?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.458
- He didn't vote for you.
- (laughs)

10:15.541 --> 10:17.166
A lot of people were
against you buying it.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.458
- Mm-hmm.
- See, we've seen some
real estate types before

10:19.541 --> 10:21.541
that buy low, sell high.

10:21.625 --> 10:24.625
No long-term investment
in the future of the league.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.041
Well, the Lakers
are your future, Dave.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.375
- Oh?
- But I'd still like
to meet the past.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.583
<i>- Where's this Auerbach?</i>
- Oh, you mean the Pope?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.250
<i>Follow the white smoke.</i>

10:34.333 --> 10:38.041
- (wind blowing)
- (mystical music playing)

10:38.125 --> 10:39.541
Jerry Buss:
<i>Red Auerbach.</i>

10:39.625 --> 10:43.125
<i>Winner of 13 rings, seven</i>
<i>of them against our club.</i>

10:43.208 --> 10:45.333
<i>No losses.</i>
<i>If you're a Laker,</i>

10:45.416 --> 10:46.583
<i>he's the devil incarnate.</i>

10:46.666 --> 10:48.625
If you're from Boston,
chances are you're Catholic,

10:48.708 --> 10:50.125
but you'd sell
your soul for him.

10:50.208 --> 10:54.000
The networks are turned off
by all this street ball.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.000
The thugs, the fighting.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.500
It scares away decent families.

10:57.583 --> 10:58.458
(laughs)

10:58.541 --> 11:00.125
Don't you worry.
Decent families

11:00.208 --> 11:02.291
have creamed their shorts
for Larry Bird.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.000
The hick with the funny haircut?

11:04.083 --> 11:06.750
That hick is gonna
win me 10 more rings.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.833
- Yeah. He got a brother?
- Hell, I'll take a sister.

11:08.916 --> 11:11.375
- (laughs)
- Jerry Buss: I'll take
the guy who'll beat him!

11:13.333 --> 11:15.541
- Dr. Buss!
- Commissioner. Red!

11:15.625 --> 11:19.125
- Jerry Buss, big fan.
- That won't last long.

11:19.208 --> 11:22.000
Well, I doubt that.
I love a winner.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.416
Well, then you bought
the wrong team.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.583
No one loses quite
like the Lakers.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.583
(laughter)

11:27.666 --> 11:28.916
Jerry Buss:
Well,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.625
I'm fixing to
change that actually.

11:30.708 --> 11:32.375
Was hoping to pick your brain
a little bit about it.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.625
You know, me and the boys
are gonna go out
on the town tonight.

11:34.708 --> 11:38.500
I got the keys
to Hefner's place,
if you wanna come along.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.041
(laughs) I bet you do.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.875
(pats leg)

11:42.958 --> 11:45.458
You fellas go
get your kicks.

11:45.541 --> 11:48.166
- I got a basketball team to run.
- (puts down lighter)

11:48.250 --> 11:49.875
Commissioner.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.875
Sure thing.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.166
Earvin Johnson:
<i>Aight, y'all.</i>
<i>Take care of me now.</i>

11:58.250 --> 11:59.750
No scratching up
my mama's walls.

11:59.833 --> 12:02.166
- Don't worry, man,
we got you.
- Aight.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.458
Yo, what I heard true?
They give you 500,000?

12:05.541 --> 12:07.416
- (whispers):
Fuck's wrong with you?
- What?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.375
Just wanna know
what it feels like.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.041
- All that money.
- It feels good, man.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.583
Feel real good. (laughs)

12:15.666 --> 12:18.083
<i>For me though,</i>
<i>it ain't about the money.</i>

12:18.166 --> 12:19.875
It's about the love.
What's up, Mikey?

12:19.958 --> 12:22.250
Tell your brother
I owe him that rematch too.

12:22.333 --> 12:26.500
- (party chatter)
- Big bro! What's up, baby?

12:26.583 --> 12:27.833
Man:
When you going
to training camp?

12:27.916 --> 12:29.750
- Earvin Johnson Sr.:
Hey, Junior!
- What's up, Pop?

12:29.833 --> 12:32.166
- Settle something
for your old man.
- Yes, sir.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.208
What's the most points
you scored in high school?

12:34.291 --> 12:35.666
- Forty-eight.
- Johnson Sr.: See?

12:35.750 --> 12:38.250
See what?
I got 12 in a quarter.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.166
- (laughs)
- Friend: <i> You was king</i>
<i>of the air ball!</i>

12:40.250 --> 12:41.625
I used to dunk
on him so much,

12:41.708 --> 12:43.291
his head used to
smell like my nuts.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.333
That's why he
lost all that hair!

12:45.416 --> 12:47.166
(overlapping laughter, chatter)

12:47.250 --> 12:50.083
- Folks in Lansing
love their boy.
- Hey, EJ.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.666
Mm, Cindy.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.791
(party chatter continues)

12:53.875 --> 12:57.000
What I tell you?
They all just rootin' me on.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.791
All one big, happy f...

12:58.875 --> 13:01.250
(chatter continues)

13:03.208 --> 13:04.916
family.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.833
We-we right here. Look.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.500
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Don't look actually.
- (sighs)

13:09.583 --> 13:11.500
Alright, one more step.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.875
Okay. Turn a little bit.
Alright.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.416
Open your eyes.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.583
What you think?

13:23.333 --> 13:25.083
I think I know how
my wall got scuffed.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.791
Don't worry about
none of that, Ma.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.458
Them construction cats,
they gonna put it in real nice,

13:29.541 --> 13:31.458
and they gonna
clean up your walls.

13:31.541 --> 13:34.666
And trample all my floors
and tear my bathroom to pieces.
No.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.333
- Where-where'd you
get this thing from?
- I bought it.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.000
Look, Ma, it got these
fancy jets and everything,

13:40.083 --> 13:41.541
just like the one
in that commercial

13:41.625 --> 13:42.833
that was always liking.

13:42.916 --> 13:45.416
<i>Camay leaves me looking</i>
<i>clean and creamy.</i>

13:45.500 --> 13:46.666
<i>Everywhere.</i>

13:46.750 --> 13:48.958
You bought this house, too,
with that Laker money,

13:49.041 --> 13:50.500
or is this still mine to see to?

13:50.583 --> 13:52.958
- 'Course it is, Ma.
- Hmm.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.625
You should have consulted me.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.000
Ma, how am I supposed
to surprise you

13:58.083 --> 13:59.583
when I go sayin'
what I'm gonna do

13:59.666 --> 14:01.791
- before I do it?
- Oh, I see.
So this is for me then?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.708
So I can forget about you
skipping school this summer.

14:04.791 --> 14:08.583
Ma, it ain't got nothin' to
do with my diploma. For real!

14:08.666 --> 14:09.916
Right hand to God. Soon as--

14:10.000 --> 14:11.708
As soon as the season over,
I'm back at it.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.708
Oh, well, that sounds good.

14:13.791 --> 14:16.291
So, I can just take
your word for it

14:16.375 --> 14:18.583
and soak my cares away?

14:19.875 --> 14:22.625
- You're supposed to be happy.
- (scoffs)

14:22.708 --> 14:25.125
You know what?
You were baptized in a tub

14:25.208 --> 14:27.541
just this size.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.458
And the water hit,

14:29.541 --> 14:33.791
and you didn't cry.
You didn't make a sound.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.916
And I thought to myself,
well, this kid

14:36.041 --> 14:37.375
is in lockstep
with the Lord.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.666
All I got to do
is raise him right.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.791
And Lord knows I tried.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.625
Just 'cause I ain't takin'
no geography this summer?

14:49.708 --> 14:53.083
Because you think
you can buy me
with a bathtub and a smile.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.125
It ain't that, Ma.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.750
I want you to stand
on your feet.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.916
I want you to have
something to fall back on.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.583
And your soul.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.458
Because when these fans
are gone and, believe me,

15:04.541 --> 15:07.125
- they will, mark my words--
- Ma, they ain't going nowhere!

15:07.208 --> 15:10.166
Whole city full of love!
Why that ain't enough for you?

15:11.458 --> 15:13.875
I was tryin' to make you happy.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.875
I was happy with my old tub.

15:24.708 --> 15:25.791
(kicks tub)

15:26.500 --> 15:28.750
(birds chirping)

15:28.833 --> 15:31.833
Karen:
<i>Good luck. He's been in</i>
<i>there since yesterday.</i>

15:31.916 --> 15:34.666
Hasn't said a word,
just locked the door.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.500
He gets this
before the season.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.291
Karen:
And after the season and during
the season and All-Star break,

15:39.375 --> 15:41.958
- and sometimes just
because it's Tuesday.
- Yeah, well, he lives

15:42.041 --> 15:43.958
and breathes basketball.
That's why we love him.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.791
- Fuck off, Bill.
- (knocking)

15:45.875 --> 15:47.500
Jerry West:
Fuck off, Bill.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.625
(sighs)
The love in this house.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.375
Karen:
I'm leaving lunch!

15:51.458 --> 15:53.083
You're welcome.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.416
Oh shit.
Are you kidding me?
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.916
- (grunting)
- (blinds rattling)

16:03.000 --> 16:04.916
Ah! Ah! Fuck! Shit!

16:05.958 --> 16:07.958
(panting)

16:10.875 --> 16:13.375
Leave me alone. I'm working.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.916
I see that.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.041
- (golf clubs rattling)
- (Bill sputters)

16:19.125 --> 16:22.708
This place reeks like
a gym sock farted.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.666
Get out then.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.833
Have you thought
about showering?

16:28.916 --> 16:31.291
Good thoughts come in
when you're showering.

16:31.375 --> 16:32.708
What's the point?

16:32.791 --> 16:35.833
Who wins, who plays,
who loses.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.500
We all end up the same anyway.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.833
Fuckin' worm food. Dead.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.375
Well, that's one perspective.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.916
- The only one.
- (sighs) Jerry...

16:46.000 --> 16:49.291
- (blinds rattling)
- I've listened to you
bitch for 10 years.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.333
About wanting
the right ingredients,

16:53.416 --> 16:56.333
and this guy is
giving you <i> carte blanche</i>
for the perfect meal.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.125
I will give you
whatever you need.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.041
Fuck. As long as there's
a fuckin' onion in it.

17:02.125 --> 17:05.040
What, are you still on
about Johnson? (laughs)

17:05.125 --> 17:08.500
(sighs)
You know what I think?
It ain't Johnson. It's you.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.415
You're afraid if you get
everything you asked for,

17:10.500 --> 17:11.708
you won't have an excuse.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.625
Fuck you, Bill! Fuck you!
I don't need no excuse!

17:14.708 --> 17:16.333
And I fuckin'
sure as shit don't need

17:16.415 --> 17:18.708
no fuckin'
six-foot-nine-inch forward

17:18.790 --> 17:21.083
playing dress-up as
a fuckin' point guard!

17:21.165 --> 17:24.333
No, if it was up to me,
I'd take the ball
out of his hands

17:24.415 --> 17:27.415
and stick him in the fuckin'
post where he belongs.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.333
Then do it.

17:31.541 --> 17:35.500
- Buss' never gonna--
- He said you had to
play the kid, not how.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.208
What are you afraid of?
He's gonna fire you?

17:37.291 --> 17:39.375
I mean, this job makes
you fuckin' miserable.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.875
It's a win-win situation!

17:41.958 --> 17:43.958
- Fuck you, I love my job.
- Then do it.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.458
Could work.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.458
It could be fucking--
It could be good.

17:50.541 --> 17:52.166
♪ ♪

17:52.250 --> 17:53.666
I'll have to talk
to Kareem first.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.125
This could... work.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.916
Fuck goddammit, dude!
This is the fuckin'
business, huh?!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.750
Why the fuck
you standing there, Bill?
I got work to do!

18:01.833 --> 18:03.083
- It's hot in LA, right?
- Hot.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.458
- Sun is all over you.
- All over you.

18:05.541 --> 18:08.125
- So what do you want when
it's hot on the outside?
- Tell him what they want.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.833
- Quincy: You want ice.
But not just any old ice.
- Larry: Ice.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.583
Both:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:12.666 --> 18:15.666
- You want some ice
with some taste in it.
- Mm-hm. Tell him what they want.

- You want... Tasty Ice.
- You want... Tasty Ice.

you should see this gift

18:22.500 --> 18:25.333
- that my Earvin gave me. A tub!
- Ladies: Oh?

18:25.416 --> 18:26.916
Just like
the white lady on TV.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.625
(cheering, laughing)

18:29.708 --> 18:31.291
- This soap leave me soft and...

Yeah? Like...

- (ladies laughing)
- Hey, why don't y'all hit me
with a business plan?

18:38.541 --> 18:39.833
Then, we can see what's what.

18:39.916 --> 18:42.208
We-we just told you
the business plan.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.500
People's gonna eat ice
and give us money.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.500
No, we'll be right back
with th-that business plan.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.291

We'll be back.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.000
I saw your mother
at Bible study.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.750
Said we should
stop by.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.083
Wanted to see you off.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.916
Yeah?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.416
Don't you work at
Happy Shoes on Sunday?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.666
When you're the manager,
you make the schedule.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.666
- Oh yeah,
you is the manager. Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.041
Congrats on the draft,
by the way.
That's a big deal.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.000
- Hey, congrats on manager.
- Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, thanks.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.750
Maybe you could stop by
the store sometime
before you leave.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.500
- The kids would love it.
- Mm, I'm sure they would.

19:28.583 --> 19:29.958
They see you
every day, so...

19:30.041 --> 19:33.208
Christine Johnson:
Brian, is that you?
Son, get in here!

19:33.291 --> 19:35.083
I need your big brain
on this fish fry.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.416
- Come on!
- Be right over, Sister Johnson.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.916
- Oh...
- You got a great mama, man.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.875
Love her to death.
Excuse me.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.916
So that's why you came through?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.958
To show me up with that sucker?

19:51.375 --> 19:52.791
I came...

19:52.875 --> 19:55.541
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to say how proud
of you I am.

19:56.791 --> 19:59.500
And that if you need
anything, I'm here.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.000
Anything?

20:05.625 --> 20:07.958
I almost forgot who
I was talkin' to.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.916
But, for real.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.500
You need an ear or friend,

20:13.583 --> 20:15.750
you know where I'm at.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.458
Cook...

20:17.541 --> 20:19.333
- Okay? You already know.
- Mm-hm.

20:19.416 --> 20:21.291
Quincy:
Man, EJ, you were right.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.208
You were right.
We did need a business plan.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.916
- And we sure enough got one.
- Boom.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.083
- Two words.
- Quincy: Two.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.958
- Blue...
- (giggles)

20:30.041 --> 20:32.708
- Berry.
- Quincy: Ooh!
Ain't nobody got that.

20:32.791 --> 20:35.916
- Larry: Nobody! Nobody...
- Quincy: Not Tastee-Freez.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.208
♪ ♪

20:38.291 --> 20:40.333
Well, it took all night
and my <i> pisher</i> grandson

20:40.416 --> 20:41.916
spit up on
the revenue distinction,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.666
but I think I cracked a budget
that might do the trick.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.958
- Maybe the barf
will cover the red ink.
- (scoffs) No hiding that.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.708
But run down to my car
and check the math.

20:48.791 --> 20:51.083
- I've got a hot date
with the books.
- Mm-hm.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.833
Love of my life.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.500
(quietly): Alright.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.000
(slams drawer)

21:03.083 --> 21:04.500
Where the fuck are the books?

21:04.583 --> 21:06.666
Officer:
So this burglary,
there were no valuables.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.750
- It was just files?
- Not just files. Our financials.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.833
It's 20 years of budgets,
balance sheets.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.958
- Frank took them.
- It's everything.
It's the whole goddamn business.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.458
Um, Frank took them.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.375
- What?
- Uh, Uncle Frank?

21:18.458 --> 21:21.041
- Frank Mariani, my Dad's--
- Yeah, I know who he is.

21:21.125 --> 21:24.708
Yeah, he came by after hours
with a few guys and some boxes.

21:24.791 --> 21:27.125
- He said it was okay--
- Claire Rothman: Okay by who?

21:27.208 --> 21:29.791
Um, I don't know.
I figured that
he talked to you--

21:29.875 --> 21:31.625
Jeanie, it's not
your job to figure.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.166
Your job is to pour coffee.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.458
Your job is to refill
the fucking stapler!

21:35.541 --> 21:37.125
And your job is to
make sure that people

21:37.208 --> 21:39.375
don't break into my office
like the Watergate burglars

21:39.458 --> 21:40.916
and make off with
my goddamn books!

21:41.000 --> 21:42.625
- I didn't know he hadn't--
- (door slams)

21:42.708 --> 21:44.833
- (banging)
- Rothman: Fuck!

21:52.041 --> 21:54.166
(phone ringing)

21:56.000 --> 21:59.083
(typing)

22:00.291 --> 22:02.750
Sorry. (sighs)
It'll be just a minute.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.708
(typing continues)

22:06.791 --> 22:08.166
Rothman:
Don't try number six.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.250
Unless you want to
burn the bedspread.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.166
Jerry Buss:
It's a win-win,
I'm telling ya.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.541
You get yourself
a beautiful
oceanfront building,

22:15.625 --> 22:17.041
and my team
gets a rebounder!

22:17.125 --> 22:19.250
Maria,
you remember Arn?

22:19.333 --> 22:20.833
Hi, Arn.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.583
Hi, Arn...

22:23.666 --> 22:26.625
I mean... I'm Arn.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.625
Let's close this thing,
alright? Claire.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.916
She closes more deals
than the lawyers.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.666
Ha. I'll bet she does.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.833
Sounds like you're trying
to free up some capital.

22:36.916 --> 22:39.208
(sighs) Can't take it
with you, Claire.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.250
What's your drink?
I'm buying.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.083
I'm just a little
bit concerned.

22:43.166 --> 22:47.291
- (ice clinking)
- What for? It's after
breakfast, isn't it?

22:47.375 --> 22:49.125
Uh, see, ordinarily
with Mr. Cooke,

22:49.208 --> 22:50.666
I'd walk him through
the books myself.

22:50.750 --> 22:51.833
- But your partner...
- Right.

22:51.916 --> 22:55.416
Mr. Mariani came by
my office unannounced.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.916
Are you kiddin' me?

22:57.041 --> 22:59.250
Goddamn...
I told him

22:59.333 --> 23:01.416
to talk to you about
that first and, you know,

23:01.500 --> 23:04.666
you can't control
everything they do.
That's Frank for you.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.791
So anyway, you strike me
as a gin gal.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.625
- I get that right?
- You got me.

23:09.708 --> 23:12.583
Talent of mine.
I can always tell.
Have a seat!

23:12.666 --> 23:13.958
Look, Mister, uh,
Dr. Buss--

23:14.041 --> 23:15.958
Jerry. Jerry.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.875
I don't know how
you run your business,

23:18.958 --> 23:21.208
but those books are
how I do my job, okay?

23:21.291 --> 23:22.791
Keeping the balance sheet
in check,

23:22.875 --> 23:25.333
overseeing expenditures,
protecting you.

23:25.416 --> 23:26.833
These are my responsibilities.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.958
Those were your
responsibilities.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.125
See, if I have her
lookin' after the books,

23:31.208 --> 23:33.083
then she'll see we're
stretched a little thin,

23:33.166 --> 23:35.708
and that kind of thing is
not great for morale.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.083
Claire,
forget about the numbers.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.708
I already have
somebody for that.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.500
You've asked me to stay on.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.333
Because I see
a bigger role for you.

23:43.416 --> 23:45.125
I want you innovating. Now,

23:45.208 --> 23:47.000
you have the Forum booked for,

23:47.083 --> 23:48.958
what, 220 nights a year?

23:49.041 --> 23:50.916
- 217.
- Not bad.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.208
But the way I see it,

23:52.291 --> 23:54.500
if we can just boost that
number up a little bit,

23:54.583 --> 23:56.666
say, to 260 nights,

23:56.750 --> 23:58.500
well then,
we're turnin' a profit.

23:58.583 --> 24:01.166
And if you can get me
to 365 days a year,

24:01.250 --> 24:03.625
- well then, we're
cookin' with gas.
- Uh, Dr. Buss,

24:03.708 --> 24:06.125
no arena in the country is
booked every night, okay?

24:06.208 --> 24:09.500
Madison Square Garden,
Caesars Palace.
Every place goes dark.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.916
Well, they're not in
the city of sunshine, right?

24:16.333 --> 24:17.416
Claire...

24:19.541 --> 24:21.250
Let's talk turkey.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.583
What turns you on?

24:27.958 --> 24:30.541
What gets your
blood pumping?

24:30.625 --> 24:33.083
Because, me,
I don't even get out of bed

24:33.166 --> 24:34.875
unless I have a hard-on
about something.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.291
- So, what excites you?
- All right.

24:38.375 --> 24:41.875
What is it going to take
for you to turn the Forum
itself into an attraction?

24:41.958 --> 24:45.333
Money. Advertising,
marketing, refurbishments.

24:45.416 --> 24:46.708
All of those are expensive.

24:46.791 --> 24:49.458
- How much?
- It would help if I had
access to a budget.

24:49.541 --> 24:50.875
You have access to me.

24:50.958 --> 24:54.666
I'm the budget.
Now, be creative.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.666
No idea is too big.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.791
We are building

24:58.875 --> 25:00.333
Shangri-La.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.208
Jessie Buss:
Well, you have really
done it this time, Gerald.

25:03.291 --> 25:06.625
Bought your way into
a grade-A money pit.

25:06.708 --> 25:09.291
- (ding)
- (cash register rings)

25:09.375 --> 25:10.625
Ma, it's the Lakers!

25:10.708 --> 25:13.416
It's gonna be like
a family business,
but bigger and better.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.250
I thought you already
got bigger and better.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.083
That's why you
and little meatball

25:17.166 --> 25:19.083
moved me on to greener pastures.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.708
I know where
the bodies are buried.

25:20.791 --> 25:22.583
Because she's the one
who buried 'em!

25:22.666 --> 25:23.583
Lot of thanks I get.

25:23.666 --> 25:26.166
Make mine a bourbon and soda.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.208
- Jerry: You've had enough.
- Jessie: Since when?

25:29.125 --> 25:31.416
- 1962?
- (Jessie laughs)

25:31.500 --> 25:33.708
- You want me old before my time.
- (pouring)

25:33.791 --> 25:35.000
Dee! Dee! Dee!

25:35.083 --> 25:37.416
I did it! I poured you one.
You don't have soda.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.708
You're just lazy.

25:38.791 --> 25:40.708
Gerald, Gerald.

25:40.791 --> 25:43.041
And why the Lakers?
There's no lakes around here.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.583
Jerry:
I can't believe
you're not excited.

25:44.666 --> 25:48.291
This puts our family
in a very elite club.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.083
Okay? Tycoons.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.375
You know, the people who
actually run the country.

25:52.458 --> 25:53.958
Captains of industry.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.750
What industry? Sweat socks?

25:55.833 --> 25:57.791
No! Show business!

25:57.875 --> 25:58.958
Forget Louis B. Mayer!

25:59.041 --> 26:01.291
We're gonna be the next
moguls in this town.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.916
You, me, Jeanie, the boys,

26:04.000 --> 26:04.958
when they come back.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.208
We're gonna be a dynasty.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.791
And then you'll be satisfied?

26:07.875 --> 26:09.416
- I'm gonna be thrilled.
- Hooey!

26:09.500 --> 26:11.916
Then you'll just start
chasing something else.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.916
- (sighs) Ma...
- What?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.625
I love you,
and I will see you

26:19.708 --> 26:22.083
whenever I don't remember
what it's like to see you.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.125
Leave the books,
I'll do the taxes.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.750
(radio playing,
indistinct singing)

26:28.833 --> 26:32.666
Best to keep your dirty laundry
in the family, don't you think?

26:32.750 --> 26:37.583
- This is a big deal!
And you should be happier!
- Oh, I'm thrilled.

26:37.666 --> 26:40.333
I'm gonna stick
his fuckin' ass
right in the post.

26:40.416 --> 26:42.833
Fuck, I love this shit...
...point guard, I'm the coach!

26:42.916 --> 26:46.791
Yes! It's fucking showtime!
Come on, showtime.

26:46.875 --> 26:50.208
I've always had a soft
spot for you, Norman.

26:50.291 --> 26:53.083
You've always had
a place right here.

26:53.166 --> 26:56.125
God fucking damn it!
Get your fucking eyes up!

26:56.208 --> 26:58.125
Trade you for a fucking mule!

26:58.208 --> 26:59.958
But I swear to God,
there is no one,

27:00.041 --> 27:01.958
and I mean it, fuckin'
no one I would rather have

27:02.041 --> 27:04.791
running my offense than
Stormin' Norman Nixon.

27:04.875 --> 27:05.875
Stormin' Norman Nixon!

27:05.958 --> 27:08.333
What kind of fucking
name is that anyway?!

27:08.416 --> 27:11.250
(laughs)
What's all this
shit about, Jerry?

27:11.333 --> 27:13.583
See, that's why I like you,
Norm. A straight shooter.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.791
Come on!
Been a lot of chat,

27:15.875 --> 27:17.458
a lot of bullshit in
the fuckin' press.
You know,

27:17.541 --> 27:20.291
this new kid comin' in,
snug-buggin' with the owner.

27:20.375 --> 27:23.041
I see how that agitates
a guy like you.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.500
Seasoned pro.

27:24.583 --> 27:27.041
A man who worked
damn fuckin' hard
to make it in this league.

27:27.125 --> 27:30.166
I want you to rest assured,
Norm, you're on solid ground.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.708
You're the point guard, Norm.
Not him.

27:34.791 --> 27:37.708
- You call yourself
a fuckin' point guard?!
- Says who?

27:37.791 --> 27:40.666
Me, Coach.
The guy who decides.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.791
So, Buss is cool with
paying half a million bucks

27:43.875 --> 27:46.666
to sit this motherfucker on
a bench and watch him smile?

27:46.750 --> 27:48.500
Buss is giving me free rein.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.791
No more meddling, man.
Shackles the fuck off.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.666
- Shackles off.
- He's giving me
the control.

27:52.750 --> 27:56.833
I need to get this team
over the fuckin' hump.

27:56.916 --> 27:58.500
'Cause that's what
we've been missing.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.208
Fuckin' jewelry on a fuckin'
basketball court!

28:01.291 --> 28:02.666
More control from you.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.000
Exactly.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.083
Okay, so my uncle

28:08.166 --> 28:10.916
owns a store in Simi.
It's called Patio Brothers.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.875
They are looking for a venue
for their annual convention.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.750
