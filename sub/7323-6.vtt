I AM A NERVE GUY.
GOES BLOOD SUPPLY, THEN NERVES.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.198
ACTUALLY, IT'S TENDONS,
THEN BLOOD SUPPLY, THEN NERVES.

09:28.198 --> 09:30.200
UM, HELLO,
WHAT ABOUT THE BONES?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.202
(Owen, Mark and Derek
all talking at once)

09:32.202 --> 09:35.205
(Callie) UM, WE ESTIMATE
THE SURGERY WILL TAKE

09:35.205 --> 09:37.848
ANYWHERE FROM 15 TO 20 HOURS.

09:37.848 --> 09:40.180
WE'LL HAVE
TWO O.R.s GOING AT ONCE.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.182
THERE WILL BE
FIVE TEAMS OF SURGEONS,

09:42.182 --> 09:43.684
ONE TEAM FOR EACH ARM,

09:43.684 --> 09:46.186
AND THEN A FIFTH JUST TO
HARVEST VEINS FROM THE LEG.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY BEEN
ONE SUCCESSFUL

09:48.188 --> 09:50.691
BILATERAL ARM TRANSPLANT
IN THE COUNTRY?
IN THE WORLD.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.693
IN THE WORLD.
YEAH, I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR

09:52.693 --> 09:55.195
AS, UH, CALLING US
MEDICAL TITANS, BUT...
(Owen) WE ARE.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.898
(Mark) NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN CALLED A TITAN.
(laughs)

09:57.898 --> 09:59.599
(Callie) UH, RIGHT NOW,

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
I AM PREPPING THE DONOR BODY

10:01.601 --> 10:04.775
TO EXTRACT ANTIBODIES
FROM HIS BLOOD.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.777
THIS IS ALL
IN PREPARATION FOR LATER,

10:06.777 --> 10:09.880
WHEN WE'LL REMOVE, UH,
BONE MARROW FROM THE DONOR,

10:09.880 --> 10:13.083
AND THEN WE'LL INFUSE THE MARROW
INTO ZACK

10:13.083 --> 10:16.346
TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF
HIS BODY REJECTING THE ARMS,

10:16.346 --> 10:18.348
WHICH IS HUGE.

10:18.348 --> 10:20.921
MORE THAN HUGE. (laughs)

10:20.921 --> 10:23.924
I MEAN, I'M NO MEDICAL TITAN,
BUT, UH... (chuckles)

10:23.924 --> 10:27.397
STILL IT'S PRETTY DAMN COOL.

10:27.397 --> 10:30.400
UH, YEAH, ZACK LOST HIS ARMS
FOUR YEARS AGO.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.402
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AT WORK.

10:32.402 --> 10:35.105
HE IS, UH, HE WAS A LOGGER.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.107
SO IT COULDA GONE EITHER WAY.

10:37.107 --> 10:39.810
I MEAN, IT--THIS THING
COULDA COME BETWEEN US

10:39.810 --> 10:42.072
OR IT COULD'VE BROUGHT US
CLOSER TOGETHER,

10:42.072 --> 10:44.274
AND FOR US...

10:44.274 --> 10:46.847
I THINK
IT'S BROUGHT US CLOSER.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.349
LITERALLY. I HAVE TO WIPE
HIS (bleep) FOR HIM.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.351
(Lexis and April laugh)
OKAY, REALLY?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.353
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

10:53.353 --> 10:55.355
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE RIGHT NOW?
YEAH, I DO.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.358
I'M SORRY. I'D COVER MY FACE,
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY HANDS.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.730
(laughs)

10:59.730 --> 11:01.131
(Lexie and April laugh)

11:01.131 --> 11:04.795
(Miranda) YOU BEEN GOOD
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU?

11:04.795 --> 11:06.296
BUSY.

11:06.296 --> 11:09.169
BILL AND I, UH, LEFT TOWN
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING,

11:09.169 --> 11:12.743
AND... PRETTY MUCH
NEVER LOOKED BACK.

11:12.743 --> 11:14.875
SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN TO PARIS,

11:14.875 --> 11:17.808
MOROCCO, ALASKA...

11:17.808 --> 11:19.710
A CRUISE THROUGH THE BALTIC.

11:19.710 --> 11:20.881
WHAT?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.382
BLEW THROUGH OUR SAVINGS,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.684
BUT... HEY, LIFE IS SHORT,
RIGHT?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.858
SURE IS.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.760
(laughs)

11:29.760 --> 11:31.762
IS THERE ANYTHING
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

11:31.762 --> 11:35.225
ONCE MY SURGERY IS DONE?

11:35.225 --> 11:37.828
(whispers) BABIES.

11:37.828 --> 11:40.130
LOTS AND LOTS OF BABIES.
(laughs)

11:40.130 --> 11:42.232
(Miranda) DEEP BREATH.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.074
ANOTHER.

11:44.074 --> 11:47.077
(alarm blaring)
(electronic female voice)
ENTER SECURITY ACCESS CODE.

11:47.077 --> 11:50.080
(blaring continues)

11:50.080 --> 11:52.082
YOU'RE SURE? YOU'RE SURE?

11:52.082 --> 11:55.215
I'M SURE. I'M SURE. I'M SURE.
I'M SURE. I'M SURE.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.717
(blaring continues)
ENTER SECURITY ACCESS CODE.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.791
(blaring continues)
(loudly) THERE ARE SOME KINKS
WITH THE NEW SECURITY SYSTEM,

12:00.791 --> 12:03.293
BUT--BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS KINKS
WITH SOMETHING...

12:03.293 --> 12:04.795
(alarm stops)

12:04.795 --> 12:06.296
(normal voice) N-NEW. AH.

12:06.296 --> 12:08.158
BUT WE'RE--
WE'RE WORKING THEM OUT.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.500
(Cristina) WE GOT THIS,
UH, NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART

12:10.500 --> 12:12.502
LIKE, LOCKDOWN SYSTEM.

12:12.502 --> 12:15.766
(Meredith) TO, UM, ISOLATE
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL

12:15.766 --> 12:17.808
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.
YEAH, 'CAUSE, UM,

12:17.808 --> 12:19.810
SUPPOSEDLY,
THE LAST EMERGENCY,

12:19.810 --> 12:23.343
THERE WERE...
SOME PEOPLE WANDERING AROUND.

12:25.075 --> 12:28.078
EVEN WITH THE KINKS,
I THINK PEOPLE FEEL SAFER,

12:28.078 --> 12:29.749
WHICH IS IMPORTANT, YEAH.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.751
(knock on door,
door opens)

12:31.751 --> 12:33.753
UH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
CHIEF.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.756
I JUST--I GOT YOUR PAGE,
BUT HEY, I CAN COME BACK.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.829
OH, NONSENSE.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.831
CONGRATULATIONS.
I JUST HEARD THE BIG NEWS,

12:40.831 --> 12:42.833
AND I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

12:42.833 --> 12:43.794
OH.

12:43.794 --> 12:46.937
UH, OUR VERY OWN, UM,
DR. ROBBINS HERE

12:46.937 --> 12:48.238
HAS BEEN AWARDED

12:48.238 --> 12:50.470
THE PRESTIGIOUS
CARTER MADISON GRANT.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.203
(Arizona) YEAH, I HAVEN'T
TOLD THAT MANY PEOPLE YET.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.205
A CARTER-MADISON GRANT?
NOBODY WINS THOSE.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.207
I MEAN, NOBODY NORMAL.
I MEAN, JUST SORT OF

12:57.207 --> 13:00.210
THOSE BRAINY, SCIENTIST TYPES
WHO ARE FROM GERMANY AND SWEDEN.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.282
OH, MY GOD! YOU WON!
ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.784
NOPE. SHE'S NOT KIDDING.
OH, COME HERE.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.456
AW, THANK YOU.

13:06.456 --> 13:09.389
NO, I DIDN'T APPLY FOR THE GRANT
BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.891
THERE ARE MAJOR GAPS

13:10.891 --> 13:12.893
IN THE CARE OF CHILDREN
IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.896
GLOBAL HEALTH INITIATIVES EXIST
FOR THINGS LIKE MALARIA,

13:15.896 --> 13:17.898
UH, INFECTIOUS DISEASES,
IMMUNIZATIONS,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.900
BUT NOT FOR PEDIATRIC SURGERY,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.872
AND WITH THIS GRANT...

13:21.872 --> 13:23.934
I COULD START TO CHANGE THAT.

13:23.934 --> 13:26.236
WELL, I APPLIED FOR THIS THING
TWO YEARS AGO.

13:26.236 --> 13:28.238
I WAS
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON.

13:28.238 --> 13:32.042
YOU KNOW, I WAS NEW HERE,
UM, A SURGICAL FELLOW...

13:32.042 --> 13:34.114
SINGLE.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.116
BUT NOW I HAVE PEOPLE HERE,

13:36.116 --> 13:38.818
IMPORTANT PEOPLE, WHICH...

13:38.818 --> 13:40.951
COMPLICATES THINGS.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.953
BUT... (sighs)
THIS IS BIGGER THAN ME.

13:42.953 --> 13:46.596
THIS IS--THIS IS
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

13:46.596 --> 13:47.928
SO...

13:47.928 --> 13:49.930
(scanner beeps)
YEAH,

13:49.930 --> 13:52.432
OF COURSE
I'M ACCEPTING THE GRANT.

13:52.432 --> 13:56.867
THAT JUST MEANS I'M...
(sighs) MOVING TO AFRICA.

13:56.867 --> 13:58.969
♪♪♪

13:58.969 --> 14:01.972
(man) COMING UP
ON "SEATTLE MEDICAL"...
(Teddy) HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN CODING?!

14:01.972 --> 14:04.014
(Lexie) UM, DR. TORRES,
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

14:04.014 --> 14:06.917
(gasps) OH, NO.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.279
(April) SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.860
WELL, I MEAN, NOT JUST ANYONE'S
A GOOD ARM DONATION CANDIDATE.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
NOT EVERY CANDIDATE
WANTS DONATED ARMS.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.896
MOST, UH, AMPUTEE PATIENTS OPT
TO CONTINUE USING PROSTHETICS.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.898
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

14:27.898 --> 14:29.900
WE'RE ATTACHING
TWO CADAVER ARMS

14:29.900 --> 14:31.902
TO ANOTHER
LIVING PERSON'S BODY.

14:31.902 --> 14:33.403
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

14:33.403 --> 14:35.405
THAT COULD REALLY MESS
WITH SOMEONE'S HEAD.

14:35.405 --> 14:37.407
NOT TO MENTION
THE REHABILITATION TIME.

14:37.407 --> 14:40.250
RECOVERING FROM SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, IT TAKES YEARS.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.252
WELL, THE SCREENING PROCESS
IS, UH, EXTENSIVE.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.254
WE HAVE TO ENSURE
THAT THE RECIPIENT

14:44.254 --> 14:46.256
IS STABLE MENTALLY
AND PHYSICALLY,

14:46.256 --> 14:48.888
DETERMINED, PATIENT,
VERY PATIENT.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.562
AND THAT'S ALL BEFORE YOU EVEN
BEGIN LOOKING FOR AN ARM.

14:52.562 --> 14:55.565
UH, IN THIS CASE, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR ARMS FOR ZACHARY

14:55.565 --> 14:57.067
FOR OVER TWO YEARS.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.069
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

14:59.069 --> 15:00.570
UM, DR. TORRES.
HMM?

15:00.570 --> 15:02.632
UH, YOU'VE PROBABLY
SEEN THIS,

15:02.632 --> 15:04.634
BUT--BUT H-HAVE YOU
SEEN THIS?

15:04.634 --> 15:07.237
(sighs)

15:07.237 --> 15:10.580
(gasps) OH, MY GOD. NO.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.582
(whispers)
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:12.582 --> 15:16.046
(normal voice) OKAY, UM,
PAGE SLOAN RIGHT NOW.

15:16.046 --> 15:18.448
(April) A TATTOO?

15:18.448 --> 15:20.450
IT'S JUST SO UNFAIR
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

15:20.450 --> 15:23.023
COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.995
(Jackson, mouth full) HI.
IS IT TRUE?

15:24.995 --> 15:26.997
ARE YOU GUYS SCRUBBING IN
ON THE...

15:26.997 --> 15:28.999
DOUBLE ARM TRANSPLANT?

15:28.999 --> 15:30.930
(laughs)

15:32.332 --> 15:34.965
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:34.965 --> 15:36.466
(chuckles) NOTHING.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.108
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:38.108 --> 15:40.070
(Callie) OH, NO, YEAH.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.072
IT'S A VERY REAL CONCERN,
ACTUALLY.

15:42.072 --> 15:44.314
THE PATIENT COULD EASILY
REJECT THE ARMS,

15:44.314 --> 15:48.048
NOT JUST PHYSICALLY
BUT EMOTIONALLY.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.050
THE FIRST-EVER
HAND TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT

15:50.050 --> 15:52.052
ULTIMATELY ASKED TO HAVE
THE HAND REMOVED.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.054
YEAH, HE SAID HE COULDN'T
CONNECT TO IT,

15:54.054 --> 15:57.057
THAT IT FELT LIKE DEAD WEIGHT
SEWN ON TO HIS BODY,

15:57.057 --> 15:59.189
THAT THE HAND WASN'T
AND NEVER WOULD BEHIS.

15:59.189 --> 16:02.262
IMAGINE LOOKING AT A TATTOO
OF YOUR DONOR'S WIFE'S NAME

16:02.262 --> 16:05.335
EVERY DAY TO REMIND YOU
THAT THESE AREN'T YOUR ARMS.
(Zack) YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:05.335 --> 16:07.337
IS THERE A PROBLEM
WITH THE ARMS?

16:07.337 --> 16:10.040
(woman) OH, GOD. THERE'S
A PROBLEM WITH THE ARMS.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.072
WELL...

16:12.072 --> 16:14.344
MAYBE.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.076
UM...

16:16.076 --> 16:19.079
THERE'S A TATTOO
ON ONE OF THE ARMS

16:19.079 --> 16:21.451
OF THE NAME "NICOLE."

16:21.451 --> 16:24.154
(sighs)

16:25.655 --> 16:28.488
(Mark clears throat)

16:28.488 --> 16:30.160
I LOVE THE NAME NICOLE.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.662
ME, TOO. I LOVE IT.
WE COULDN'T LOVE IT MORE.

16:32.662 --> 16:34.664
I SAW WE RENAME
OUR DOG NICOLE.

16:34.664 --> 16:36.166
I'M GONNA
NAME MYSELF NICOLE.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.667
(laughs) CHANGE MY NAME.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.170
IF IT MEANS I CAN STILL
GET THOSE ARMS,

16:40.170 --> 16:43.603
THEN... NICOLE IS
MY NEW FAVORITE NAME.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.075
YEAH.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.277
(laughs) I WAS--I WAS NOT
EXPECTING THAT.

16:47.277 --> 16:50.140
HE GOT THAT TATTOO EXACTLY
ONE YEAR AFTER WE MET.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.441
(chuckles and sniffles)

16:51.441 --> 16:54.144
HE TOOK ME TO THE TATTOO SHOP
AND TOLD ME

16:54.144 --> 16:56.146
HE WAS GONNA GET THIS TATTOO

16:56.146 --> 16:59.149
TO SHOW ME JUST HOW MUCH
HE LOVED ME, WHICH...

16:59.149 --> 17:02.722
IS WHEN I'M PRETTY SURE I CALLED
HIM AN IDIOT OR SOMETHING WORSE.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.556
YOU DON'T DECLARE YOUR LOVE
FOR SOMEONE BY GETTING A TATTOO.

17:06.556 --> 17:08.558
YOU DO NORMAL THINGS, LIKE--

17:08.558 --> 17:11.731
LIKE PLAN A NICE DATE,
OR--OR WRITE A POEM,

17:11.731 --> 17:14.734
OR HELL, DROP DOWN
ON ONE KNEE AND PROPOSE.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.066
(sniffles)

17:16.066 --> 17:19.069
YOU DON'T BRAND YOURSELF
WITH ANOTHER PERSON'S NAME.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.040
(sniffles)

17:21.040 --> 17:22.712
(laughs)

17:22.712 --> 17:25.445
WHICH IS WHEN SAM SAID, "OKAY,"

17:25.445 --> 17:28.078
AND HE GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE,

17:28.078 --> 17:30.650
PULLED OUT A RING
AND PROPOSED... (sniffles)

17:30.650 --> 17:32.652
ON THE SPOT.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.225
AFTER THAT, EVERY TIME...

17:35.225 --> 17:37.227
EVEN IF WE WERE FIGHTING

17:37.227 --> 17:39.789
OR I WAS MAD AT HIM
BECAUSE HE FORGOT TO...

17:39.789 --> 17:43.763
TAKE THE GARBAGE CANS OUT
OR...

17:43.763 --> 17:47.167
I'D CATCH A GLIMPSE
OF THAT TATTOO,

17:47.167 --> 17:50.800
AND I'D REMEMBER,
THIS GUY LOVES ME. (sniffles)

17:50.800 --> 17:55.345
EVEN IF THE GARBAGE IS GONNA
SMELL UP THE YARD FOR A WEEK...

17:55.345 --> 17:57.247
HE LOVES ME.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.078
(sniffles)

18:01.151 --> 18:04.354
LOVED ME.

18:04.354 --> 18:06.656
(Alex) I DON'T EVEN LIKE KIDS.

18:06.656 --> 18:09.088
COME ON.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.390
OH.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.193
UGH!

18:13.193 --> 18:15.125
(beeps)

18:19.399 --> 18:21.271
(Alex) PEDIATRIC SURGERY

18:21.271 --> 18:25.235
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH LIKING KIDS.

18:25.235 --> 18:28.238
ALL RIGHT, LILY. I NEED YOU
TO STAY STILL, OKAY?

18:28.238 --> 18:30.240
OR YOU'RE GONNA MESS UP
THE TEST.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.542
I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT OVER THERE IN THAT BOOTH,

18:32.542 --> 18:35.145
AND THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

18:35.145 --> 18:36.416
(sighs)

18:36.416 --> 18:39.619

(squeaks)

18:40.790 --> 18:42.652
I'M SORRY.

18:44.194 --> 18:45.695
HEY, LOOK, GUYS,

18:45.695 --> 18:48.698
WHY DON'T YOU BACK OFF
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, OKAY?

18:48.698 --> 18:51.861
HEY. (whispers)
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

18:51.861 --> 18:54.864
(Alex) I MEAN, YOU GO INTO PEDS

PEDIATRIC SURGERY
IS THE ELITE OF THE ELITE,

SO YEAH,
I'D CONSIDER SPECIALIZING...

19:25.335 --> 19:28.167
(continues singing indistinctly)
IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY, FOR SURE.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.340

19:39.879 --> 19:42.712
IT'S ACTUALLY
A GOOD THING THAT...

19:42.712 --> 19:45.385
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED HERE
INSTEAD OF SOMEWHERE ELSE,

19:45.385 --> 19:48.258
BECAUSE WE ARE BETTER EQUIPPED
TO HANDLE TRAUMA.

19:48.258 --> 19:50.560
I MEAN, WE SEE TRAUMA EVERY DAY.
IT'S OUR JOB.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.562
(Meredith)
WE GOT A STAB WOUND THERE.

19:52.562 --> 19:54.724
YEAH, I-I GOT IT.
(man) PUT HIM ON A MONITOR.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.496

OH, WOW.

20:16.286 --> 20:18.918
(elevator bell dings)
NO, IT'S NOT STRANGE DR. YANG
ISN'T COMING WITH ME.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.920
I WAS AVAILABLE,
SO I'LL TAKE THIS GUY,

20:20.920 --> 20:23.923
SHE'LL TAKE THE NEXT ONE.
IT'S FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.925

WE COULD MOVE UP
OUR NEXT TRIP,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.255
SKIP OUT OF HERE, AND--AND JUST
CATCH A PLANE TONIGHT.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.888
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN FINE
THIS LONG WITHOUT THE SURGERY.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.890
YOU'D BE FINE
A LITTLE LONGER.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.333
(Miranda) COLOSTOMY REVERSAL
IS A VERY BASIC SURGERY.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.336
ON A TYPICAL DAY, I MIGHT DO
TWO OR THREE IN A ROW.

21:06.336 --> 21:07.637
UH, THIS WAS THE SURGERY

21:07.637 --> 21:10.340
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PERFORM
ON MARY THAT DAY.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.272
THE DAY THAT...

21:13.272 --> 21:15.445
THAT--THAT, UM...

21:15.445 --> 21:17.547
ANYWAY, UM,

21:17.547 --> 21:19.409
MEDICALLY SPEAKING,

21:19.409 --> 21:22.281
SHE WAS GETTING
A LITTLE STOMA PROLAPSE

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
AND SOME
ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCES,

21:24.283 --> 21:27.056
SO IT'S GOOD THAT
WE'RE DOING THE SURGERY NOW.

21:27.056 --> 21:30.390
GOOD TO GET IT OVER WITH.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.392
SO WE JUST GOT
LILY'S LABS BACK,

21:32.392 --> 21:34.664
AND I'M TAKING 'EM
TO DR. ROBBINS.

21:34.664 --> 21:37.327
THEY DON'T, UH...
(Arizona) I MEAN,
I'M JUST SAYING,

21:37.327 --> 21:39.829
I THINK THAT AT LEAST
YOU COULD BE HAPPY.
WELL, I THOUGHT WE WERE HAP--

21:39.829 --> 21:42.031
(clears throat)
UH, SHOULD I COME BACK?

21:42.031 --> 21:44.674
NO, WHATEVER.
WE'RE DONE ANYWAY.

21:44.674 --> 21:46.035
(sighs)

21:46.035 --> 21:48.378
UH, YOU HAVE--
YOU HAVE LILY'S RESULTS?

21:48.378 --> 21:50.880
(Callie) WELL,
IT'S HER DECISION, OBVIOUSLY.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.882
(chuckles)
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

21:52.882 --> 21:54.884
I MEAN, YOU DON'T JUST, UH,

21:54.884 --> 21:56.886
TURN DOWN
A CARTER MADISON GRANT.

21:56.886 --> 21:58.888
NOBODY TURNS DOWN
A CARTER MADISON GRANT.

21:58.888 --> 22:01.451
I MEAN, I-I...
I KNOW THAT. I...

22:01.451 --> 22:03.623
I UNDERSTAND THAT. I DO.

22:03.623 --> 22:07.096
I MEAN, IF THE SITUATION
WERE REVERSED...

22:07.096 --> 22:10.830
OH. (sighs)

22:10.830 --> 22:14.333
ACTUALLY, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.336
IF THE SITUATION WERE REVERSED,
I WOULD TURN THE THING DOWN.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.338
I WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER

22:19.338 --> 22:23.373
MOVING TO ANOTHER CONTINENT
RIGHT NOW.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.375
BUT I'M NOT HER.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.846
SO, UH...

22:26.846 --> 22:30.119
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

22:30.119 --> 22:32.522
(surgical team
speaking indistinctly)

22:32.522 --> 22:35.655
HOPE YOU'VE GOT
THAT BONE SAW READY,

22:35.655 --> 22:39.959
'CAUSE I AM REALLY IN THE MOOD
TO CUT OFF SOME ARMS.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.532
(Arizona) UNFORTUNATELY,
BECAUSE OF HER PRIOR SURGERIES,

22:42.532 --> 22:44.033
LILY HAS FISTULAS

22:44.033 --> 22:47.366
THAT MAKE REMOVING HER TUMOR
THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.368
THE TUMOR IS NOW SO LARGE

22:49.368 --> 22:51.401
THAT IT'S IMPINGING
ON HER AIRWAY AND ESOPHAGUS.

22:51.401 --> 22:53.403
REMOVING THE TUMOR

22:53.403 --> 22:55.975
WOULD MEAN REMOVING
LILY'S ENTIRE TRACHEA,

22:55.975 --> 22:57.647
WHICH MEANS...

22:57.647 --> 22:59.979
LILY WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO BREATHE AT ALL.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.481
(Alex) THE OTHER THING

23:01.481 --> 23:04.484
THAT'S CHANGED FOR ME MOST
SINCE THE SHOOTING IS THAT...

23:04.484 --> 23:07.156
NOW I FEEL LIKE...

23:07.156 --> 23:09.589
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO,

23:09.589 --> 23:11.090
'CAUSE I SHOULD'VE DIED.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.092
YOU KNOW,
I WAS SHOT POINT-BLANK.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.764
SO, UH...

23:14.764 --> 23:16.766
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO.

23:16.766 --> 23:19.469
(crying)
SO YOU'RE SAYING...

23:19.469 --> 23:21.471
THAT IF YOU OPERATE...

23:21.471 --> 23:23.473
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE,

23:23.473 --> 23:28.938
AND IF YOU DON'T OPERATE,
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.028
SO IN A FEW MINUTES,
WE'LL BE READY

23:49.028 --> 23:51.531
TO COMPLETELY DETACH
THE ARMS FROM THE DONOR.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.863
WHY USE ZIGZAG INCISIONS?

23:53.863 --> 23:55.865
(April)
TO GET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE.

23:55.865 --> 23:57.867
GOOD.
SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE?

23:57.867 --> 24:00.169
I'M TAGGING EACH VESSEL,
ARTERY AND VEIN

24:00.169 --> 24:04.013
SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO
HOOK THEM UP TO THE RECIPIENT.

24:04.013 --> 24:06.516
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE BACK OF YOUR TV.

24:06.516 --> 24:08.518
YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHICH CONNECTION GOES WHERE,

24:08.518 --> 24:11.751
OR YOU WIND UP
WITH SOUND AND NO PICTURE

24:11.751 --> 24:14.183
OR A PICTURE AND NO SOUND.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.128

24:19.128 --> 24:23.563

24:23.563 --> 24:24.794
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:24.794 --> 24:27.697
(Callie) THE MINUTE WE REMOVE
THE ARMS FROM THE DONOR,

24:27.697 --> 24:30.640
THE TISSUE STARTS TO DIE, SO WE
HAVE TO WORK FAST, REALLY FAST.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.471
WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED WINDOW

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
TO COMPLETE
THIS PART OF THE SURGERY.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.185
OKAY.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.487
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.119
(camera shutters clicking)

24:50.119 --> 24:51.621
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:51.621 --> 24:53.492
I WAS SENT TO GET COFFEE
FOR DR. SLOAN

24:53.492 --> 24:55.494
BECAUSE HE NEEDS HIS CAFFEINE
RIGHT NOW

24:55.494 --> 24:57.496
TO GET THROUGH
THE MOST AMAZING SURGERY

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
IN O.R. 2.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.571
SO I-I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S NOT OKAY

25:01.571 --> 25:03.573
TO BE LATE FOR THE MAKING
OF MEDICAL HISTORY,

25:03.573 --> 25:05.575
SO YOU NEED
TO LET ME THROUGH, OKAY,

25:05.575 --> 25:08.578
TO GET TO THAT SURGERY,
TO GET DR. SLOAN HIS CAFFEINE,

25:08.578 --> 25:10.840
TO WITNESS MEDICAL HISTORY
BEING MADE.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.842
I-I--MY I.D. IS VALID,
I PROMISE.

25:12.842 --> 25:15.044
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

25:15.044 --> 25:17.516
YEAH, SHE--SHE SWIPED IT
A COUPLE TIMES.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.518
IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH.
(speaks indistinctly)

25:19.518 --> 25:21.520
(whispers) JUST GO. JUST GO.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.523

ENTER SECURITY ACCESS CODE.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.555
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:56.555 --> 25:58.557
(April)
SO WE'RE ABOUT NINE HOURS IN.

25:58.557 --> 26:02.131
UH, DR. TORRES HAS FINISHED
ATTACHING THE DONOR ARM BONES

26:02.131 --> 26:04.163
TO THE RECIPIENT
WITH TITANIUM PLATES AND SCREWS,

26:04.163 --> 26:07.837
AND NOW THEY ARE BEGINNING
TO ATTACH THE TENDONS.

26:09.338 --> 26:10.840
(Owen) I'M ON IT.

26:15.645 --> 26:17.046
(woman laughs)

26:17.046 --> 26:18.708
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

26:18.708 --> 26:21.180
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.012
(sighs)

26:23.012 --> 26:25.014
(Derek) HAS GETTING SHOT
CHANGED ME?

26:25.014 --> 26:27.617
UM, I DON'T THINK

26:27.617 --> 26:30.760
I LOVE MY JOB
ANY MORE OR ANY LESS.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.062
UM, I DON'T THINK I'M...

26:33.062 --> 26:35.594
I'M A-A BETTER DOCTOR
OR WORSE.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.197
UH, IF ANYTHING
IT'S MADE ME GRATEFUL,

26:38.197 --> 26:40.199
UM, TO BE HERE.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.201
SO YEAH,
GETTING SHOT HAS CHANGED ME

26:42.201 --> 26:45.334
IN THE SENSE THAT
I FEEL LUCKY.

26:45.334 --> 26:47.006
(suction gurgles)

26:47.006 --> 26:49.008
WE'VE RECONNECTED
THE ARTERIES AND VEINS.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.210
(Owen) BUT WE NEED
TO CHECK THE CIRCULATION

26:51.210 --> 26:53.212
BEFORE WE CONTINUE.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.714
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW

26:54.714 --> 26:57.046
IS RELEASE THE TOURNIQUETS
ONE ARM AT A TIME

26:57.046 --> 26:59.689
AND THEN LOOK TO SEE
IF BLOOD FLOWS INTO THE VESSELS.

26:59.689 --> 27:01.751
(Callie) OKAY,
MOMENT OF TRUTH.

27:01.751 --> 27:04.724
(Mark)
RELEASING THE TOURNIQUET.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.704
(Callie) ARM'S PINKING UP!

27:14.704 --> 27:18.067
(Derek) THAT'S GOOD.
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

27:18.067 --> 27:21.741
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

27:26.315 --> 27:28.647
THE COMMUTE'S TOUGH.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.949
WE'VE BEEN COMING HERE

27:29.949 --> 27:32.421
SINCE LILY'S TUMOR GOT DIAGNOSED
THREE YEARS AGO.

27:32.421 --> 27:35.825
IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US,
JUST LILY AND I.

27:35.825 --> 27:37.827
WE LIVE OVER THREE HOURS AWAY,

27:37.827 --> 27:40.830
SO IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO COME MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK

27:40.830 --> 27:42.792
AND WEEKENDS.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.664
I HATE
LEAVING HER FOR THAT LONG.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.898
BUT I JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

27:48.898 --> 27:51.701
I WANT HER TO LIVE.

27:51.701 --> 27:53.703
DR. ROBBINS CAME TO ME,
AND SHE SAID

27:53.703 --> 27:56.706
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THEY
COULD DO FOR LILY AFTER ALL--

27:56.706 --> 27:59.078
SOMETHING EXPERIMENTAL.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.752
UM, THAT'S WHY YOU COME
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

28:02.752 --> 28:06.055
BECAUSE EVEN IF IT IS A COMMUTE,
THREE HOURS ON THE ROAD,

28:06.055 --> 28:09.288
IT'S NOTHING IF--
IF IT'LL SAVE LILY'S LIFE.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.290
(Arizona)
WE'VE COMPLETED A STENT

28:11.290 --> 28:13.292
TO TEMPORARILY
HELP LILY BREATHE,

28:13.292 --> 28:15.795
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA REMOVE
PART OF HER TWELFTH RIB.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.876
SEE? IT'S JUST
ONE MORE EXAMPLE

28:26.876 --> 28:28.878
OF HOW
OUR DOCTORS HERE RISE.

28:28.878 --> 28:31.841
FIRST A CARTER MADISON
GRANT WINNER,

28:31.841 --> 28:33.983
AND NOW CUTTING-EDGE...

28:33.983 --> 28:36.445
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.

28:36.445 --> 28:38.447
(Arizona) WELL, THERE'S
NO ARTIFICIAL REPLACEMENT

28:38.447 --> 28:39.949
FOR A TRACHEA.

28:39.949 --> 28:42.151
WE KNOW THAT.
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED A STUDY,

28:42.151 --> 28:44.754
AND I THOUGHT, WELL...
WHAT IF IT ISN'T ARTIFICIAL?

28:44.754 --> 28:46.996
WE'RE GONNA USE
SOME OF LILY'S OWN CELLS

28:46.996 --> 28:48.998
TO MANUFACTURE HER
A NEW TRACHEA.

O-OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

YEAH, I'M NOT A FAN.

BUY ZACK T-SHIRTS AND HOODIES.

A POSSIBLE COMPLICATION
