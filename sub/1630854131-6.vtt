00:03.104 --> 00:04.538
Why didn't you
scream for help?

00:04.638 --> 00:05.606
My mom told everyone
you went home.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.241
- Is Sunny?
- Yes.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.544
Maybe you can go into the camp
and get something for me?

00:10.644 --> 00:13.047
CID says the body's been here
less than 48 hours.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.515
Decomp is pretty bad.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
I wonder if the body
was moved here.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.185
- Look at this.
- A little backpacker?

00:17.285 --> 00:18.786
Walter was trying
to save his life.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.089
I let him use the old truck
to move the backpacker's body,

00:21.189 --> 00:22.690
and Cassie Dewell
saw him driving it.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.592
- Get out of my tent.
- Where's your girlfriend?

00:24.692 --> 00:27.895
I don't have the $15 million.
She took it and left.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.697
You try to run,
Donno will find you, and...

00:29.797 --> 00:30.798
Chop, chop.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.301
Today got me thinking
about my mom.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.103
Well, Hoyt, all relationships
have to be a two-way street.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.904
- I hate it when you do that.
- What?

00:37.004 --> 00:38.539
The whole
cowboy wisdom thing.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.607
Fine.
I actually kinda like it.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.475
I sure am gonna miss
that ol' gal.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.944
Got no other choice with
the blood and the DNA evidence.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.279
Are you with me?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.748
Till they bury me deep
in the ground.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.139
Diego.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.806
Wake up.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
What? What is it?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.747
I h-- I heard something downstairs.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.751
Must be that damn raccoon
knocking over cans again.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.753
- Are you sure?
- Let me handle it.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.327
I'll be right back.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.601
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Now, go back to sleep.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.175
It's probably nothing.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.892
Hey! Aah!

02:04.992 --> 02:05.993
Diego!

02:14.768 --> 02:16.036
Aaaaah!

02:31.519 --> 02:33.521
Fire chief says
it's arson.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.988
This the same
blue-and-white

02:35.088 --> 02:36.156
truck you saw the other day?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.726
Looks like it.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.361
Somebody want to bring me
up to speed?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.530
Cassie saw a creepy guy
on the side of the road.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.498
He had a truck
just like this.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.334
What made him creepy?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.502
Just a feeling he gave me.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.837
You think he's somehow connected

02:49.937 --> 02:51.405
- to your dead backpacker?
- I don't know.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.073
It just felt like there
was something

02:53.274 --> 02:54.875
in the back of the truck
that he didn't want me to see.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.379
Well, whatever it was,
the evidence is gone now.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.048
And the VIN's been destroyed.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.452
Well, there should be a VIN
on the engine block.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.756
This is Arlen. Talk to me.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.858
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.601
There it is.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.803
Okay, got it.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.372
- Nice.
- Copy that.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.407
Hoyt, we gotta roll.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.242
There's been a homicide
out near Fort Harrison.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.578
You good?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.313
Yeah, I'm just gonna
have Denise run the VIN.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.781
Okay, but keep us posted.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.649
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.965
It wasn't there.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.268
No, it's there.
It has to be.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.103
I searched Luke's tent.
Your bag wasn't in it.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.405
Well, you need to look again!

03:57.505 --> 03:58.806
Don't tell me
what I need to do!

03:58.906 --> 04:01.342
I'm sorry.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.811
I'm trying my best
to help you.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.649
I am not bad news
like Luke.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
When I was younger,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.654
people say
I did a bad thing,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.423
but it was for a reason.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.695
Is...

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
this bad thing

04:23.931 --> 04:26.133
the reason you're hiding
from the cops?

04:27.635 --> 04:29.770
I didn't have a choice.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.509
Whatever it was...

04:38.346 --> 04:40.013
...I understand.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.183
You do?

04:48.456 --> 04:51.625
Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.829
This bag you want so bad...

04:57.465 --> 04:58.532
...what's in it?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.068
Something valuable.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.235
A journal.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.004
It's important to you?

05:05.473 --> 05:06.874
Yes.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.509
Well, then it's
important to me, too.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.845
- But Luke doesn't have it.
- Somebody in that camp does.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.516
Maybe my mother.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.717
Why? Why would she have it?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.653
She thinks she has
to clean up my messes.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.525
I know you would
never hurt me.

05:25.593 --> 05:29.096
You told me that
and I believe you.

05:33.367 --> 05:37.170
Can you look
for the bag again, please?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.206
I need that journal.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.774
Sure.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.944
I can do that.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.783
See? We're a team.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.191
Victim is Diego Mendoza, 44.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.127
Bludgeoned to death
with a tire iron.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.631
Wife heard someone trying
to break into the house.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.299
He went down to check it out
and confronted the guy,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.802
and, well, this is
how she found him.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.271
Did the wife get a look
at the guy?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.806
Negative. Sounds like it all
happened pretty fast.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.075
What are we thinking,
home invasion gone wrong?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.910
It's about a car.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.113
Victim owned a black
1979 Firebird Trans Am.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.282
That's an iconic ride.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.617
Car like that's
worth money.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.487
- Targeted theft, then.
- It's gotta be.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.655
Get ahold of local
law enforcement

06:27.755 --> 06:29.156
in case our thief
can't help himself

06:29.256 --> 06:30.290
and decides to take it out

06:30.390 --> 06:31.492
- for another spin.
- Copy.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.761
I'm just thinking...

06:33.861 --> 06:35.596
...you know, there's no way
our victim would've left

06:35.696 --> 06:37.931
his cherished baby
naked and exposed

06:38.031 --> 06:39.933
a-and with no way home
if she ever got lost.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.301
Think he's got a LoJack
or something?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.103
I'd bet on it.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.480

07:04.692 --> 07:05.926

So, uh, what brings you

07:08.295 --> 07:10.531
I found those carved hearts
you mentioned.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.265
Yeah, creepy, right?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.334
Yeah.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.536
<i>♪ I've got a home</i>

07:15.636 --> 07:18.171
Is, uh-- Is that it?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.940
You came all the way up here
to tell me that?

07:20.040 --> 07:23.310
No. I have to talk
to your father.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.813
My father? What about?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.816
Better I talk to him first.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.317
Well, now I'm intrigued.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.152
Follow me.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.993
Let's go after dinner
when everybody's asleep.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.162
You gonna let me
do the talking?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.497
I am not.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.998
Walter will listen to me.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.834
And if he doesn't?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.402
Let's not go there
unless we have to.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.672
- Knock, knock.
- Hey.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.507
Brought you a visitor.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.744
- Cassie!
- Hi.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.878
You're becoming a regular
around here.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.847
Might need to get you a tent.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.016
Uh, sorry, I just need
to ask Buck about something.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.552
Okay.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.486
Cormac, why don't you go check
on the generator?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.657
Yes, ma'am.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.358
So, what's on your mind,
Cassie?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.364
Oh, you don't have
to worry about me.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.932
Buck and I have been married
so long,

08:19.032 --> 08:20.601
we've just morphed
into one big ol' blob.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.838
We don't have any secrets
between each other.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.607
Like she says.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.209
I-I wanted to ask you
about a truck

08:29.309 --> 08:31.011
that's registered
in your name.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.780
Our family business requires

08:32.880 --> 08:34.715
a lot of vehicles,
most of them in my name.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.017
This one's
a blue-and-white Suburban.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.755
Someone set it on fire
last night.

08:46.426 --> 08:49.029
Blue-and-white Suburban?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.599
Oh.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.534
Well, that must've been
10 years ago, I sold her,

08:54.635 --> 08:56.970
- wasn't it, Sunny?
- Oh, at least.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.739
- Yeah, a long, long time ago.
- Yeah.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.040
What's this about, Cassie?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.775
You say somebody
caught it on fire?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.877
Yeah, just
a few miles from here.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.713
- Huh.
- Wow, what's this world

09:05.813 --> 09:07.280
- coming to?
- I know.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.482
Yeah, I'm not here
about the fire,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.652
but I think it may be connected
to the dead backpacker

09:11.752 --> 09:13.286
we found not too far from here.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.488
Cormac told me about that.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.490
- Yeah, that's terrible.
- Yeah.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.826
I-I don't understand.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.327
You think the dead backpacker

09:20.427 --> 09:22.162
has something to do
with Buck's old truck?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.231
Could be.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
It would help if you remembered
who you sold it to

09:26.266 --> 09:28.435
'cause the title
didn't transfer.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.671
Well, now you're testing
the old noggin.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.810
You know what? I do remember
it was a young guy.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.979
He paid cash, as I recall.

09:39.079 --> 09:44.652
I think his name was, uh, Ron
or, uh, Bob?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.820
He was a logger,
I'm pretty sure.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.122
I saw a man driving it.

09:49.222 --> 09:53.160
Um, late 30s, early 40s,
brown hair, light beard.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.463
Something
really off about him.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.965
Hm.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.969
Well, I-- Well...
doesn't ring a bell.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.872
Holy heck,
you're no help at all!

10:04.972 --> 10:08.642
You know, we may still have
some record of it somewhere.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.111
We'll check in the attic soon
as we get back home, okay?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.846
- Oh, that'd be great.
- Great! Great.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.447
- Good to see you.
- Well, thanks for stopping by.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.649
Yeah.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.450
A tent's always available
for ya.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.488
I don't like her.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.995
That is 100% American muscle
right there.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.163
You mean the car, right?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.802
Appreciate you looking after it
till we could get here.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.004
Not a problem.
I figured she was about

10:37.104 --> 10:38.706
the prettiest thing I was gonna
see this entire shift,

10:38.806 --> 10:40.507
but...
I guess I was wrong.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.179
Officer Lister,
Sheriff Beau Arlen.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.514
This here's
Deputy Jenny Hoyt.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.517
Well, it's just Knox,
like the fort.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.019
Can I be
of any assistance?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.487
I think we're squared away,
but thanks.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.158
Savages! Oh, that is
a hanging offense.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.993
Uh, if you need her towed,
I can call it in for you.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.695
We've got a flatbed coming.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.697
The car is part of
a homicide investigation.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.599
Well, heck,
from what I've heard,

11:06.700 --> 11:07.868
the killer's
as good as caught,

11:07.968 --> 11:09.036
with you on the case,
Deputy Hoyt.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.571
Oh, you said it, Lister.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.509
Hoyt always gets her man.
So to speak.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.047
Any chance
you drink coffee?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.849
<i>♪ Loving all the time</i>

11:21.949 --> 11:23.616

11:23.717 --> 11:24.918
<i>♪ She can take you high</i>

11:25.018 --> 11:27.855
I didn't figure you
for that.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.522
Well, you know what they say,
"You can't get a hit if you

11:29.622 --> 11:30.623
don't step up to the plate."

11:30.724 --> 11:33.226
<i>♪ Oh, baby, you know
it's where you go ♪</i>

11:35.863 --> 11:36.964
I'll see you around,
Deputy Hoyt.

11:38.966 --> 11:39.967
<i>♪ While I roll</i>

11:41.268 --> 11:42.402
What, are you like one of those
pinky-in-the-air tea drinkers?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.636
Is that, uh...

11:43.737 --> 11:45.438
You are a mystery wrapped
in an enigma.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.742
Did you find the tracker, or
were you too busy eavesdropping?

11:48.842 --> 11:49.943
I got it. I got it.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.044
Just saying,
I think he likes ya.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.747
Well, I don't date cops.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.448
At least, not anymore.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.450
Copy that.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.420
All right, so, our killer
steals a collector's car,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.289
he rips up the trunk,
and then he just dumps it?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.824
What are we thinking?

12:03.924 --> 12:06.459
He must've been looking
for something inside.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.795
<i>♪ Baby, here it is again</i>

12:07.895 --> 12:09.496
Something worth killing for.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.765
<i>♪ Yeah, it's all right</i>

12:16.469 --> 12:18.939
Well, I guess, um, everyone's
out and about this morning.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.473
Mm-hmm.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.644
Is Luke with Mary?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.946
No, actually, I think
he went hiking

12:26.046 --> 12:28.481
with that freaky new couple,
Tonya and Donno.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.918
Oh.
That's interesting.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.252
Right?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.321
I thought we were done
with the whole Luke thing.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.456
Yes, we are. We're just,
you know, chatting.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.258
It's, uh, nothing for you
to worry about.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.128
Well, what I worry about
is your obsession.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.330
The two of you
playing crime junkie

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
is not how I thought you two
would bond,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.100
but I'll take it.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.503
He's the one that likes
to snoop in tents.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.638
Oh.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.610
Oh, that's very interesting.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.712
So, you add tent snooper
to your résumé.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.849
Whose tent did you snoop?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.652
It was Luke and Paige's, but...

13:05.752 --> 13:06.719
Oh.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.355
...it was an accident, so...

13:08.455 --> 13:10.357
How was that an accident?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.163
Well, it-- it wasn't
an accident, uh, per se.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.566
- I knew it.
- Mm.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.671
Luke and Paige were missing,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.907
and, yes, I was worried.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.341
And I didn't want to show it

13:28.441 --> 13:30.743
because I didn't want you
to get scared.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.413
So I lied to you.

13:33.513 --> 13:37.184
I thought if you knew
how worried I was,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.319
that you would reach out
to your father

13:39.419 --> 13:42.555
and he would rush up here,
like the hero that he is,

13:42.655 --> 13:44.391
and, uh, I...

13:46.693 --> 13:48.161
I didn't want to look weak.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.733
So, you went into their tent
because of Beau?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.735
Yeah.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
Look, I'm sorry,

13:57.938 --> 13:59.572
and I apologize to you both.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.843
It's okay.
It's just the Beau thing?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.212
It's a little crazy.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.414
- Yes, I need to work on that.
- Okay.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.849
Well, did you find anything?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.087
No. Unfortunately, I didn't.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.632
Why are we even here?

14:25.732 --> 14:28.035
Because returning to the site
where a traumatic event occurred

14:28.135 --> 14:29.369
could jog your memory.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.072
A-And if it doesn't?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.974
Then we'll try
a different technique.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.779
Look, it was dark, okay?
We were lost,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.748
and I had had about enough of
Paige messing with me.

14:41.848 --> 14:42.815
And then what?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.217
Well, then she ditched me.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.653
You said you saw someone
with a light

14:46.753 --> 14:48.455
and then you fell
and you hit your head.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.091
Did you trip?
Did this somebody push you?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.593
Look, I-I can't be sure.
I don't remember.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.596
Or you're lying. Should we see
what the lie detector thinks?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.932
You don't have to keep
threatening me, okay?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.800
I know that helping you two
is my best chance

15:00.900 --> 15:01.969
at getting out of here alive.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.103
It's your only chance.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.471
Hey, Donno, please.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.976
All right, tell us about this
journal that Paige has,

15:09.076 --> 15:11.811
the one that's worth
$15 million?!

15:11.911 --> 15:15.482
Look, i-it has a seed phrase
in it that unlocks an account.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.818
- It's like a long password.
- And you don't know it?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.354
Well, I-I know the words, but
not the order that it goes in.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.689
Paige insisted on that.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.192
Smart girl.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.828
So, she ditched you, she found
her way back to camp,

15:28.928 --> 15:30.998
she got her bag
with this very valuable journal

15:31.098 --> 15:33.166
without anybody noticing,
and then she disappeared.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.834
- That's what you're saying?
- Yes.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.503
And what about this person
with the light?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.338
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.340
At first,
I thought it was someone

15:40.440 --> 15:42.309
the people
we stole from sent,

15:42.409 --> 15:44.978
but then you two showed up.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.446
Maybe someone else took Paige.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.788
Someone you didn't see coming.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.401
I can see you're excited
about something, Poppernak.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.337
Let's keep it simple. Hoyt.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.073
Uh, don't get you boxers
in a bunch. I'm coming.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.408
All right, whaddya got?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.677
The Trans Am that was stolen,
it wasn't the first.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.747
Another Trans Am,
same year and style,

16:20.847 --> 16:21.848
was stolen a week ago
in Billings.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.216
And the owner
of this sweet ride?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.585
- Slept through the robbery.
- Did the car turn up?

16:25.685 --> 16:26.986
- Here.
- Three days ago,

16:27.087 --> 16:28.521
abandoned on the side
of the road,

16:28.621 --> 16:31.558
trunk torn all apart
just like the other one.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.161
All right, so, clearly,
somebody's looking for something

16:34.261 --> 16:37.164
inside a 1979 Pontiac
Trans Am.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.365
Wonder what they're
looking for.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.567
Maybe their lost youth

16:40.667 --> 16:42.569
- or sense of manhood?
- Whoa. Whoa!

16:42.669 --> 16:45.438
Hoyt, I'm thinking maybe
you just don't understand cars.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.573
Or men.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.575
Cars aren't
that complicated.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.577
Men?
Even less so.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.745
Well, I'll have you know
that us men,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.682
we still have a few secrets
and mysteries up our sleeves.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.684
Mm-hmm.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.719
Hey, Pop, what question
am I about to ask you?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.957
How many 1979 Trans Ams
are registered in the state?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.426
- Bingo!
- Yay.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.630
- Seriously, how many?
- Oh, three, yeah.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.599
The one we found,
the one in Billings,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.967
and a third one,
also here in Helena.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.304
And that is where things
get very interesting.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.806
Okay.
We're listening.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.409
Okay, so, the last car
changed hands a couple of times

17:22.509 --> 17:24.477
after the original owner,
Mickey Prescott,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.913
went to prison
for robbery, burglary--

17:27.013 --> 17:28.481
basically just a whole lot
of stealing.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.483
Is Prescott still
behind bars?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.152
Nope.
Got out a few months ago.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.122
Could've stolen something,
hid it in his car,

17:35.222 --> 17:36.989
now he wants it back?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.991
Look at the brains on this--

17:39.092 --> 17:40.960
And she thinks I keep you
around for your good looks.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.962
- If I had a nickle for--
- Okay, focus, boys.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.764
What about the current owner
of the car?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.066
- They could be in danger.
- Got an address on him, too.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.269
Working on
a phone number.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.970
You know what?
Let's not risk waiting.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.306
You want the owner,
or you want the ex-con?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.308
You know me.
I always want the bad guy.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.856
Sheriff's Department!
Open up!

18:09.956 --> 18:11.824
Someone's in there.
I can hear them.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.094
Last chance!

18:18.631 --> 18:20.333
Well, hold your horses,
for Pete's sake!

18:20.433 --> 18:21.934
Mickey Prescott?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.837
- I'm him.
- You about lost your door.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.006
Well, hell, I don't get around
like I used to, young man.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.210
Mr. Prescott, I'm Deputy Hoyt.
This is Deputy Poppernak.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.512
Do you mind if we come in
and ask you a few questions?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.681
Well, sure.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.716
Ain't like I got
anything else to do.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.972
Sheriff's Department!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.843
Anybody home?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.012
Uh, yeah. Hello. Hi.
Come on in.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.580
- Greg Thorne?
- Yeah.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.016
Hi. Sheriff Beau Arlen.
Sorry for the intrusion.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.318
Uh, door was just open, so...

19:11.418 --> 19:13.486
Oh, not-- not a problem
at all, sir.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.323
Did I do something wrong?

19:16.423 --> 19:17.690
No, it's actually
about that beauty

19:17.790 --> 19:18.891
you got parked
out in the driveway.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.092
It's got me jealous.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.594
Oh.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.196
Wondered if you had a minute
to chat.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.064
Yeah, come on in.
Got some coffee on.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.099
Oh. Fantastic.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.210
Okay. Fire away.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.079
We want to talk about a car
you used to own.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.914
Car? What car?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.383
1979 Trans Am.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.884
Personal favorite of mine, sir.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.354
Had a poster of one
on my wall.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.121
You're talking
about Delilah.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.391
Excuse me, who?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.960
I think it's his pet name
for the Trans Am.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.464
- So, you do know of it?
- Well, hell yeah.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.900
Although, I hadn't laid eyes
on her in over two decades.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.304
Or maybe you're just not
the type to kiss and tell.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.474
Is that your way of asking me
for an alibi?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.576
Oh, come on.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.645
You and I both know I can't
just take your word for it.

20:14.614 --> 20:18.251
Where were you last night
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.?

20:18.351 --> 20:22.389
Deputy Hoyt,
if I'm up at 2:00 a.m.,

20:22.489 --> 20:24.257
it's to go to the john.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.727
And you don't have
to take my word for it.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
Just pop into the building
manager's office

20:29.929 --> 20:31.898
and you'll see cameras all
over the place.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.337
I did my time.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.341
That old car is...

20:41.441 --> 20:45.578
like all the crimes
I committed--

20:45.678 --> 20:48.848
part of my ancient past.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.518
Hm.
We'll check out those cameras.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.185
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Prescott.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.356
It's no bother at all.
Gets lonely on the outside.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.158
Nice to have visitors.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.861
Especially one
as pretty as you are.

21:03.663 --> 21:07.367
I-I hope you don't
take offense to that.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.268
I'll let it slide.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.109
Listen, I, uh-- I appreciate
the heads-up, Sheriff,

21:17.209 --> 21:19.479
and, uh, if anyone tries
to steal my car,

21:19.579 --> 21:20.647
trust me, I will be ready.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.483
Oh, I'm sure you will be.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.318
But listen, I want to go about
things a little bit differently.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.119
Want to make sure
that you're safe,

21:27.219 --> 21:29.021
and I want to use
your car as bait.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.323
- Bait?
- Mm.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.624
What, my baby out there?

21:31.724 --> 21:34.293
Trust me, I won't let anything
happen to her, okay?

21:34.394 --> 21:38.798
I swear on Burt Reynolds
on that, may he rest in peace.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.503
Somebody else here?

21:43.603 --> 21:47.407
Uh, just the, uh,
bane of my existence.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.143
My dog.
Doesn't like being cooped up.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.345
Be right back.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.717
Help! Help!

22:34.654 --> 22:35.755
You good?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.690
I'm-- I'm good.
I'm good.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.062
Stop!

22:51.237 --> 22:52.805
Whoa!

22:58.478 --> 23:02.314
Admit it, for a career criminal,
you kinda liked him.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.484
Charming old guy.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.786
You said
you're done dating cops,

23:06.886 --> 23:08.488
but what about the bad guys?

23:10.423 --> 23:14.160
Yeah, rerouting.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.162
Hello?

23:16.262 --> 23:18.297
Hey, how'd it go
with the, uh, ex-con?

23:18.397 --> 23:21.100
He's not our guy.
Any luck on your end?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.803
Well--

23:23.903 --> 23:26.005
Depends on how
you define luck, Hoyt.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.481
<i>♪ Ah</i>
Food's here!

23:34.581 --> 23:36.415
- Nice.
- How'd it go up at Sunny's?

23:36.516 --> 23:39.318
Buck said he sold that truck
a long time ago.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.953
- Oh, to who?
- Doesn't remember,

23:41.053 --> 23:42.489
and I can't find a record

23:42.589 --> 23:44.824
of the truck
ever changing hands, so...

23:44.924 --> 23:47.627
Well, maybe the new owner
never registered it.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.428
Buck could've just signed
the title over,

23:49.529 --> 23:51.297
grabbed the cash,
and forgot about it.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.099
I sold my old Hyundai

23:53.199 --> 23:56.469
for three pounds of morels
and a cord of firewood.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.839
Signed that title over and told
that guy to tow that puppy away.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.508
Hm.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.209
I mean, maybe.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.146
- You think he's lying.
- I don't know.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.016
I can't see Buck or Sunny
being involved with this,

24:10.116 --> 24:13.052
but I have to consider it,
you know?

24:13.152 --> 24:16.823
Okay, so let's say is lying to
you about the truck. Why?

24:16.923 --> 24:19.492
To protect himself
or somebody else.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.993
So, who was the guy
in the truck?

24:21.093 --> 24:23.195
Exactly. That's what we have
to figure out.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.032
So I'm thinking we do
a composite sketch.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.900
Couldn't hurt.
So, anyway, if it's okay,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.902
I thought I would poke
around some

24:30.002 --> 24:31.203
of those messaging boards,
you know,

24:31.303 --> 24:32.705
the ones where
people are obsessed

24:32.805 --> 24:35.007
with solving
the unsolved crime.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.209
I mean, you know,
they're online detectives.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.746
Yeah, right, t-the--
the wannabe detectives.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.648
- That's what you mean, right?
- You said that, I didn't.

24:41.748 --> 24:46.052
I know this started off
sounding crazy, but...

24:46.152 --> 24:51.023
we've got a heart here
and hearts carved in trees,

24:51.123 --> 24:53.893
so the connection
to the Bleeding Heart murder

24:53.993 --> 24:57.496
doesn't maybe sound
so crazy anymore.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.533
I just thought I would ask to
see if there's anybody out there

25:00.633 --> 25:03.002
who remembers something
or knows something.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.572
Yeah. Okay.
Like you said, it can't hurt.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.723
Looking for something?

25:24.757 --> 25:27.627
No.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.395
I was just, um...

25:29.495 --> 25:32.131
hiking nearby and I-I thought
I heard people.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.433
I didn't realize
there was a camp here.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.102
Hiking.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.037
Where's you water bottle?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.641
I don't have one.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.977
- Where's yours?
- I'm not hiking.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.714
What are you doing, then?

25:47.814 --> 25:49.248
Watching you watch the camp.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.753
You live in the woods?

25:53.853 --> 25:57.289
Now, why would you
ask me that?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.225
'Cause you're not hiking.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.293
And you got that
"I live in the woods" vibe.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.964
Suppose I took that
as an insult.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.304
Well, that would be unfortunate.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.306
For me or for you?

26:19.411 --> 26:22.181
I lived in the back
of a butcher's shop once.

26:22.281 --> 26:25.117
Used to think I heard the
dead animals move at night.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.153
You can get used
to anything, I guess.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.989
Lots of things
move at night out here.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.991
Is it lonely?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.326
Butcher shop was.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.162
Sometimes.

26:36.262 --> 26:40.166
We're all a little strange
when it comes down to it, hm?

26:41.634 --> 26:45.537
That's my superpower--
strange.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.807
And violent.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.978
Can I help you
with something?

26:52.078 --> 26:53.312
I'm looking for a woman.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.981
She went hiking
with her boyfriend,

26:55.081 --> 26:56.148
boyfriend came home,
she didn't.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.184
Sounds like
a bad boyfriend.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.988
I agree.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.823
Have you seen her?
Her name's Paige.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.360
No. I haven't seen her.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.534
Word of advice?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.971
If you're gonna lurk
around the camp, be quieter.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.674
I spotted you
five minutes ago.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.868
You hurt?

27:48.968 --> 27:50.036
I just tweaked
a little something,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.004
jumping on to the hood
of that car.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.006
I swear I could've had a career
as a Hollywood stuntman.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.375
- Nope.
- Yeah, a short one.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.777
What about a career
as the person

27:57.877 --> 27:59.111
who's gonna help me
solve this crime?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.413
Got that handled.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.449
Check this out.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.119
If you mirror your screen
to mine,

28:07.219 --> 28:08.520
you'll see that we are
in business.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.289
You connected
the LoJack to it?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.591
Indeed, I did.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.931
Ooh.
Nice work, Hollywood.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.032
Thank you very much.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.069
I'm gonna notify
the state police

28:23.169 --> 28:24.303
and have them
set up roadblocks.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.376
Hold that thought.
He stopped.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.114
Wait. It's gone.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.583
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.420
He must've found the GPS
tracker and ditched it.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.591
Or he's some place where
the signal doesn't work.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.973
Sheriff's Department!

29:01.073 --> 29:02.174
Hands in the air!

29:16.823 --> 29:20.927
- Hey.
- Hey, Cormac.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.595
Did you get those kayaks
prepped for tomorrow?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.697
- I did.
- Excellent.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.533
Why don't you grab a bucket
and a sponge?

29:27.633 --> 29:28.868
Ol' Gutter needs a bath.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.140
Hey, uh,
sorry about earlier.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.309
Cassie asked where you were.
I told her.

29:37.977 --> 29:41.881
No apology necessary.
Cassie's just doing her job.

29:41.981 --> 29:45.317
Dead backpacker,
truck set on fire.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.120
Hope she gets
to the bottom of it.

29:49.956 --> 29:54.726
Kinda weird, though,
you owning that truck before.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.729
I've owned a lot of trucks, son.
You know that.

29:57.830 --> 30:02.168
Your daddy's right.
Nothing for you to worry about.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.904
- I'm not worried.
- Tell me...

30:05.004 --> 30:08.407
you and Cassie got sumthin'
sumthin' going on?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.012
No.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.050
Need to work
on your poker face.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.988
Go on, git back to work.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.389
Towels are over there.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.025
Don't forget
to wash his nose.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.328
Fly season.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.338
Cecil Ezterhas.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.007
Looks like somebody
just walked up to his car

30:41.107 --> 30:43.009
and shot him point-blank.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.078
Yeah, there's a, uh--
there's a compartment back here.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.180
Whatever was in it's long gone,
but I'm betting this is

30:48.280 --> 30:49.681
what it's all about.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.017
Check it out.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.685
Prison tattoo.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.088
Okay, boys.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.289
Yes, sir.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.626
- Hang on.
- Yeah.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.898
Hey, Pops,
run the name Cecil Ezterhas.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.800
Find out where he did his time
and with who.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.315
Sheriff's Department!

31:25.884 --> 31:28.754
Don't do it.

31:28.854 --> 31:32.891
Let me guess--
my idiot cellmate led you here.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.094
No, it was just
my daring ingenuity

31:35.194 --> 31:37.063
and her smarts.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.231
Why kill Cecil?

31:39.331 --> 31:41.267
Because he was sloppy.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.802
He made a mess
of a simple job.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.739
Besides, I wasn't gonna give him
half of my treasure, anyway.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.641
What is this... treasure?

31:49.741 --> 31:51.110
The ultimate collectible.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.980
Way cooler
than that Trans Am.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.815
I don't know
how that's possible.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.850
That's because
you're not named Mickey.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.454
- No.
- Yeah.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.822
Okay, boys, a-are--
are you done yet?

32:03.922 --> 32:06.993
You know the drill.
Hands behind your head

32:07.093 --> 32:08.860
and interlock
your fingers.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.462
Now.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.466
You'll be dead
before you reach it.

32:14.566 --> 32:15.867
She's right, Mickey.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.137
I'll give you a choice--

32:18.237 --> 32:19.638
you touch that gun,
we're gonna shoot you,

32:19.738 --> 32:22.141
that box remains closed.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.809
You give yourself up,

32:23.909 --> 32:25.644
I'll let you have one last look
at what's inside.

32:25.744 --> 32:29.148
- You know what's in there?
- I have a pretty good guess.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.188
Good choice.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.300
We made a deal.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.835
Uh, yeah, we did.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.509
Oh.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.012
A baseball card?
That's what this is all about?

33:00.112 --> 33:01.747
No, no, oh, not just
any baseball card.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.749
That is a--

33:03.849 --> 33:06.218
That is a Mickey Mantle
rookie card.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.553
It is worth millions.

33:07.653 --> 33:11.057
You know, in my entire life,
there was only two things

33:11.157 --> 33:12.224
that I cherished.

33:12.324 --> 33:16.428
And one of them was that
Trans Am named Delilah.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.997
And the other one is
this card.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.768
Well, you're going back
to prison.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.736
Take your last look.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.277
It was worth it.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.928
You still didn't find it?
I need that bag!

33:50.028 --> 33:51.930
I got sidetracked.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.100
What do you mean?

33:54.200 --> 33:58.104
Someone is looking for you.
Seemed dangerous.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.909
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, no.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.111
They found us.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.279
No.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.947
It's okay.
It's okay.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.416
I took his measure.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.318
No, Walter,
this is so not okay.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.952
This is really,
really bad.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.156
What did you do?
The truth, please.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.995
Luke and I s-stole
some money.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.132
Thought that we could
lay low for a bit,

34:26.232 --> 34:28.400
that the people we stole
from wouldn't find us,

34:28.500 --> 34:32.138
but now you're saying
someone is here!

34:32.238 --> 34:34.740
- You're scared.
- Yes!

34:36.475 --> 34:38.144
- Don't be.
- What?!

34:38.244 --> 34:40.279
What are you
talking about?!

34:40.379 --> 34:42.348
When I was younger,
I had a friend.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.784
Her name was Meredith.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.090
The people who adopted me,
they didn't like her because--

34:52.191 --> 34:54.326
'cause she didn't like
the way that they treated me.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.130
One day, they hurt Meredith.

34:58.230 --> 35:01.300
They hurt her so bad.
Made me watch.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.470
I couldn't protect her.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.207
Walter, why are you
telling me this?

35:08.307 --> 35:09.475
'Cause everything can be fixed.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.042
- No, it can't.
- Yes, it can!

35:11.143 --> 35:12.144
No!

35:17.316 --> 35:21.387
The next night, I burned their
house to the ground

35:21.487 --> 35:23.389
while they were asleep
in their beds.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.995
I've been paying for it
ever since, but...

35:30.095 --> 35:34.333
...I made sure that
they never hurt her again.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.840
When I told you
I would protect you...

35:44.410 --> 35:45.877
...I meant it.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.486
Mm, no bull's-eye?

35:54.586 --> 35:57.155
Rusty.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.657
I could hit you, though.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.498
There's a man living
in the woods.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.434
- I saw him.
- What kind of man?

36:08.534 --> 36:10.602
The kind that lives
in the woods.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.538
Could this be the guy
that you're talking about,

36:12.638 --> 36:14.072
the one with the
flashing light?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.908
U-Unless there's some other guy
living in the woods.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.744
Said he hadn't seen Paige.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.679
I don't know
if I believe him.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.350
Hm.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.352
The plot thickens.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.699
Wow.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.769
Okay, you're full
of surprises.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.305
Well, I was the, uh,
secondary high school champ.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.874
Just don't ask me
to shoot a gun, that's all.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.410
Deal.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.585
Poor Mary, huh?

36:59.685 --> 37:01.487
Ditched by Luke
for the odd couple.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.723
Yeah, they do seem
very friendly, don't they?

37:04.823 --> 37:05.824
Mm-hmm.

37:09.495 --> 37:12.230
Let's go, Mom.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.293
Oh, my God.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.273
Sunny! Buck!

37:55.374 --> 37:57.976
Mary, what did I tell you
about the buddy system?!

37:58.076 --> 37:59.311
T-There's something
you need to see.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.779
H-Hold on a second.
What's going on?

38:00.879 --> 38:02.448
Paige's bag.
I found it in the woods.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.183
Paige's bag?
Well, that can't be right.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.518
Are you sure it's hers?

38:06.618 --> 38:07.853
Leopard print,
letter "P" bag charm?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.187
I-I clocked it the day
they got here.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.956
Like, who brings that
on a camping trip?

38:11.056 --> 38:12.458
H-Hold on a second.
Where--

38:12.558 --> 38:13.659
Can you show me
where the bag is?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.861
- Yeah.
- I'll go.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.463
You stay with the horses.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.164
It's okay, Buck.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.501
Mary and I will be right back.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.169
Okay. Let's go.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.748
You sure this is the guy
you saw with the truck?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.316
- Yep.
- Mm.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.752
Looks a little worse for wear.
Tweaker, maybe?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.821
Got his hands on Buck's
old truck at some point?

38:42.921 --> 38:45.090
And then set it on fire?

38:45.190 --> 38:46.858
Well, like I said, tweaker.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.860
They don't do
the most logical things.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.196
- I guess anything's possible.
- I'm gonna have Poppernak

38:51.296 --> 38:52.564

- You're working on it.
- Yeah?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.318
You seem to be asking
my mom and dad

39:47.419 --> 39:50.956
a lot of questions
about the backpacker.

39:51.056 --> 39:54.826

to tell me?

39:54.926 --> 39:57.295

I'm just doing my job.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.965

40:00.065 --> 40:01.600
Yeah. I get that.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.503

40:07.739 --> 40:10.976
Be straight with me.

My parents may be
a lot of things, but...

40:13.712 --> 40:15.647
they're good people.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.449
I've always thought that.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.618
And I want that to be true.
I really do.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.826
Maybe that's the thing.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.995
So do I.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.969
Just over here.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.805
Why were you out here
by yourself?

40:39.905 --> 40:41.773
Just needed to go for a run
to clear my head.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.142
But then I found
Paige's bag and clothes.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.712
I-I think maybe Luke buried it
after he killed her

40:46.812 --> 40:48.480
and then some animal
dug it up?

40:48.580 --> 40:51.449
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.284
Okay.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.053
Wait.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.824
You told everybody
you heard from Paige.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.326
Said she was safe and sound
in New York, right?

41:01.426 --> 41:02.894
I did. Yeah.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.997
But maybe
Luke got her cellphone

41:06.097 --> 41:08.166
and called us
to throw us off track.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.502
- Right. You're right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.638
I didn't think of that.

came back to camp,

41:29.588 --> 41:31.222
you were the one
that checked their tent.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.492
You said Paige's stuff
was gone.

41:34.593 --> 41:37.729
But he just got back to camp.
H-He couldn't have had time.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.197
Why not?

41:39.297 --> 41:41.232

that Paige came back

41:41.332 --> 41:43.401
and got all of her stuff,
but we were wrong.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.003

No. No, no.
