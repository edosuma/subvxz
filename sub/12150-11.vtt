00:01.929 --> 00:03.229
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:06.469
- How about a song?
- The Host helps people.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.769
- Senses their futures.
- Only when they sing karaoke.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.970
They brought her back. I need
to know why. Why like this?

00:15.730 --> 00:16.850
Why human?

00:21.129 --> 00:24.039
I believe you said something
about a massacre.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.980
For God's sake, help us.

00:27.129 --> 00:30.149
- People are going to die.
- I can't seem to care.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.859
- What you did--
- Is wrong.

00:34.329 --> 00:35.130
You went too far.

00:35.530 --> 00:40.100
The three of us are all that's
standing between you and real darkness.

00:40.929 --> 00:42.159
You're all fired.

00:48.729 --> 00:50.479
What just happened?

00:51.130 --> 00:53.659
Can someone explain to me
what happened?

00:54.130 --> 00:55.570
- We were fired.
- Canned.

00:55.929 --> 00:56.630
- Let go.
- Axed.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.109
- Dismissed.
- Booted.

00:58.329 --> 01:00.079
All right. I get it.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.849
But what just happened?

01:06.129 --> 01:07.250
Fired?

01:07.329 --> 01:09.359
Angel fired us?

01:09.730 --> 01:10.739
Looks that way.

01:15.129 --> 01:17.480
- I can't believe it.
- Keep a level head.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.650
Perhaps he'll change his mind.

01:22.930 --> 01:26.019
He locked 20 lawyers in a room
with two vampires.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.870
- I'd say his mind's changed enough.
- Darla!

01:30.730 --> 01:32.239
It's all about Darla.

01:33.129 --> 01:35.549
Well, at least Angel's consistent.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.549
It's always some blond driving
him over the edge.

01:42.129 --> 01:45.459
- What do we do now?
- Think I'll get a burrito.

01:48.129 --> 01:49.109
What?

01:51.129 --> 01:53.019
By all means, if you're hungry.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.390
Hey, this was just a side gig.

01:55.329 --> 01:56.980
The extra cash was nice...

01:57.730 --> 02:00.680
...but Angel wants to go commando....
No skin off my nose.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.000
Well, my nose skin is angry. And hurt.

02:04.329 --> 02:05.450
- And--
- Disappointed?

02:11.530 --> 02:14.300
I won't pretend to understand
Angel's reasons.

02:15.729 --> 02:18.050
But maybe he needs to be alone now.

02:18.729 --> 02:22.870
And the best thing we can do
for him is to let him be.

02:23.530 --> 02:24.789
Alone.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074

04:11.129 --> 04:12.740
I'm not ready yet,

04:14.569 --> 04:17.060
Too many years sleeping
in soft beds...

04:17.569 --> 04:19.990
...living in a world where
I don't belong,

04:24.209 --> 04:27.370
I can't fight now, Not yet,

04:28.410 --> 04:29.740
But soon,

05:05.730 --> 05:10.009
- Sir, you should be in a hospital.
- She saved me.

05:11.129 --> 05:15.129
- You should be checked out by a doctor.
- There's gotta be a reason.

05:15.930 --> 05:19.720
- Why am I the only one left?
- You're in shock.

05:21.329 --> 05:23.189
I'm the only one left.

05:23.730 --> 05:25.800
Hey, we've got a live one here.

05:26.129 --> 05:27.000
We do?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.870
Ma'am, can you stand up?

05:36.930 --> 05:38.089
Lilah.

05:41.129 --> 05:42.529
You've gotta be kidding me,

05:43.209 --> 05:46.930
He fired you? You're on a mission
to protect the innocent.

05:48.009 --> 05:51.339
He can't fire you.
What did he say, exactly?

05:52.209 --> 05:53.540
- "You're fired."
- Oh.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.000
Can you file a grievance
with the union?

05:57.610 --> 05:59.259
I'm not in a union. I'm--

06:01.209 --> 06:04.509
I don't even know what
the name of my job is. Was.

06:06.009 --> 06:09.490
You're a renowned specialist
in supernatural aid and rescue.

06:10.209 --> 06:12.139
No, I'm just--

06:12.610 --> 06:13.449
Renowned?

06:13.810 --> 06:16.160
To me you are.
You saved my life.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.360
But you should be in a union.
Father used union conjurers.

06:21.009 --> 06:23.920
- I didn't know.
- Wizards are very progressive.

06:24.610 --> 06:26.959
Your father tried to sacrifice you.

06:27.610 --> 06:30.310
And I'll never talk to him again.

06:30.610 --> 06:35.029
Although I'm healing, thanks to a lot
of therapy and a huge trust fund.

06:37.209 --> 06:39.379
You know what it is? He's jealous.

06:40.209 --> 06:41.889
- Your father?
- No, Angel.

06:43.209 --> 06:46.540
You impersonated him to
rescue me, and you were too good.

06:47.410 --> 06:48.740
I don't think so.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.310
He fired Cordy and Gunn too.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.980
All of you? Why?

06:53.410 --> 06:57.240
It has to do with Darla
being made a vampire again...

06:58.209 --> 06:59.860
...and being with Drusilla.

07:01.209 --> 07:03.879
The three of them have
a very tangled past.

07:04.810 --> 07:07.410
I guess he doesn't want us
in his way.

07:08.410 --> 07:12.730
Well, his loss. You'll get
another job, just like that.

07:13.810 --> 07:15.529
What else can you do?

07:23.410 --> 07:24.389
Not much.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.649
When Wolfram & Hart take
a life, they do it at a distance,

07:37.050 --> 07:38.699
I don't have that luxury,

07:46.649 --> 07:48.610
It's time,

08:14.769 --> 08:16.980
I'm not on their level,

08:26.170 --> 08:28.240
But I can get there,

08:34.929 --> 08:39.250
And when I do, I'll be right up close,
I'll bring the fight to them,

08:45.970 --> 08:48.320
No messages? Are you sure? Check--

08:48.370 --> 08:49.210
Thanks.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.529
- Getting the freeze-out?
- Lilah....

08:52.570 --> 08:55.269
You bitter because Darla
didn't kill me?

08:55.570 --> 08:58.269
- More like bummed.
- Sorry to disappoint.

08:59.169 --> 09:02.259
So I'm not the only one
feeling the lack of empathy.

09:02.769 --> 09:04.870
- What?
- No phone calls. No flowers.

09:05.769 --> 09:08.090
I could be nervous,
but I'm just pissed.

09:08.169 --> 09:11.500
We're the only survivors.
We're under suspicion.

09:12.370 --> 09:16.970
I don't like suspicion. Next we'll
turn up dead in some freak accident.

09:17.769 --> 09:19.279
We did nothing wrong.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.539
That has nothing to do with it.

09:23.769 --> 09:28.049
If they're looking for a scapegoat,
we might as well grow horns.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.200
A scapegoat, Lilah? They--

09:33.970 --> 09:37.799
They wanted Drusilla brought in.
I was following orders.

09:38.769 --> 09:41.159
And you honestly think that matters?

09:41.769 --> 09:45.769
Don't doubt for a minute
someone's gonna pay, Lindsey.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.220
And we're the only ones left.

09:52.570 --> 09:53.870
Not the only ones.

09:54.370 --> 09:56.230
Lindsey, I've missed you.

09:56.769 --> 09:58.029
Close the door.

10:00.370 --> 10:04.480
If we'd wanted you dead, you'd have
never made it out of the cellar.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.570
Now close the door.

10:12.970 --> 10:15.460
He's got cow eyes, big and black.

10:17.769 --> 10:19.100
Moo....

10:22.570 --> 10:24.080
You spared me.

10:25.570 --> 10:27.889
Why did you spare me, Darla?

10:28.570 --> 10:30.669
Do you really have to ask?

10:35.169 --> 10:36.470
I love you.

10:45.970 --> 10:46.980
Shut up, Lilah.

10:50.769 --> 10:53.889
Look at you two. Such pretty scars.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.399
You put us in a difficult position.

10:57.370 --> 11:01.090
Did I? Smart young lawyers,
hungry for their big break and...

11:02.169 --> 11:05.580
...oops, boss gets eaten.
Someone's got to step in.

11:06.370 --> 11:08.690
Someone pretty,
with questionable ethics...

11:08.769 --> 11:11.789
...and $1200 suits that
look good on the 6:00 news.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.899
You think they'll promote him?

11:15.370 --> 11:17.259
Or you.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.460
In any case, that's why you're here.

11:23.769 --> 11:27.179
I've decided to keep the line
of communication open...

11:27.970 --> 11:29.899
...between us and Wolfram & Hart.

11:30.370 --> 11:32.470
- What for?
- We can help each other.

11:32.769 --> 11:35.090
What is it exactly that
you want, Darla?

11:37.570 --> 11:39.500
Power.

11:40.570 --> 11:44.779
During my stint as Wolfram & Hart's
puppet, something occurred to me:

11:45.370 --> 11:46.879
I loathe being used.

11:47.769 --> 11:50.789
I believe I sent you a 15-body memo
to that effect.

11:53.169 --> 11:55.590
We're gonna be big players
in this town.

11:56.169 --> 11:59.679
You don't have what I want,
but you have what I need.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.049
Money. Connections.

12:02.769 --> 12:04.169
We're no good to you dead.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.409
The senior partners are looking for
someone to blame for your massacre.

12:08.769 --> 12:12.389
Surely they wouldn't kill
both of you. Seems like a waste.

12:15.970 --> 12:19.659
Well, I guess whoever's left standing
will be our liaison.

12:20.769 --> 12:23.440
- Liaison to what?
- To the world above.

12:23.769 --> 12:25.940
In the meantime,
we'll focus on the world below.

12:26.769 --> 12:31.019
This power that you want,
does it have a target?

12:33.970 --> 12:35.580
- Maybe Angel?
- Don't say that.

12:38.169 --> 12:42.210
Not everything is about Angel.
I just want to have some fun.

12:44.169 --> 12:47.220
I thought you would make him
your top priority.

12:47.769 --> 12:50.399
I spent 250 years without Angel.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.970
You think being human
made me go all gooey?

12:54.370 --> 12:55.419
No.

12:56.769 --> 12:59.090
No, I thought you'd kill him.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.320
All in good time, my love.

13:03.970 --> 13:05.409
All in good time.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.759
They were just waiting for us.

13:35.370 --> 13:39.870
All crouched and hiding
in that little back room.

13:40.769 --> 13:45.340
I don't usually hit the fast food
places. The people are all greasy.

13:46.169 --> 13:48.419
But this was like Christmas!

14:41.690 --> 14:43.370
I'm ready,

14:46.490 --> 14:48.169
I've got the moves,

14:48.889 --> 14:51.169
Now I need to know
what theirs are,

15:13.210 --> 15:15.210
- Bloody mary.
- Want real blood?

15:16.210 --> 15:18.600
No. Bloodless, thanks.

15:35.409 --> 15:36.350
Thank you.

15:37.210 --> 15:40.539
We'll take a break and see
who wants to sing next.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.070
Steady on, Wesley.

15:46.809 --> 15:48.980
Perhaps something by...

15:49.809 --> 15:51.139
...Cat Stevens.

15:51.009 --> 15:53.610
- Your drink, sir.
- Oh. Thank you.

15:57.009 --> 15:58.690
- Wesley!
- Cordelia! How...

16:00.009 --> 16:01.059
...odd to see you.

16:02.409 --> 16:03.779
What are you doing here?

16:04.809 --> 16:07.580
Me? Oh, I just came in for a drink.

16:07.809 --> 16:11.570
Because only demon
karaoke bars have those.

16:13.210 --> 16:15.600
- You were gonna sing.
- Dear Lord, no.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.740
No.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.070
I merely--

16:22.809 --> 16:24.700
- What are you doing here?
- Oh!

16:25.809 --> 16:27.250
Ah, well....

16:29.409 --> 16:33.200
- I was in the neighborhood
- You live 15 miles away.

16:33.610 --> 16:37.509
Well, you know L.A. It's all
one really big neighborhood.

16:38.409 --> 16:39.490
I see.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.700
Come to find your destiny, have you?

16:46.809 --> 16:50.669
- And who is gonna help you?
- Shania Twain or Madonna.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.639
I haven't decided.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.889
We're both at loose ends,
since Angel--

17:00.610 --> 17:02.080
- Pulled a total wig.
- Quite.

17:05.410 --> 17:08.670
- I'm somewhat embarrassed--
- How do you think I feel?

17:11.410 --> 17:14.319
Gunn, what are you...?

17:16.809 --> 17:18.950
You said this was just a side gig.

17:19.809 --> 17:23.430
I can't have you seeing through
my macho exterior.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.410
Oh, heavens forfend.

17:27.009 --> 17:30.660
I'll assume it's not Madonna.
What song were you gonna sing?

17:32.410 --> 17:33.740
You wouldn't know it.

17:35.410 --> 17:39.980
I, for one, would like to point out
the patheticness that is us.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.799
This is all Angel's fault.

17:47.410 --> 17:51.480
Hope he's happy now. Alone in his
demon world with no one to talk to.

17:52.410 --> 17:53.529
I'll talk!

17:56.609 --> 17:58.569
I'm telling you, I don't know--

18:04.410 --> 18:06.730
Is this how you get your rocks off?

18:09.210 --> 18:11.170
All right! All right!

18:11.609 --> 18:15.329
I heard about your girls.
Godzilla, Darcilla, whatever.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.529
They've been looking for demons...

18:21.210 --> 18:23.529
...to join some crew they're running.

18:24.210 --> 18:26.769
That's all I know, man, I swear.

18:30.809 --> 18:31.750
Okay!

18:32.609 --> 18:34.009
Okay! Okay!

18:34.410 --> 18:37.250
You didn't hear this from me but...

18:37.410 --> 18:41.130
...you know that Bar and Bite Club
off La Cienega and Washington?

18:42.210 --> 18:45.440
That's the only demon haunt
they ain't been to.

18:50.009 --> 18:52.500
Hey, you're gonna cut me down, right?

18:53.609 --> 18:56.210
You're gonna leave me hanging? Hey!

18:56.609 --> 18:57.480
Hey!

18:58.410 --> 19:00.160
I'm spinning here, man!

19:01.410 --> 19:03.089
Freaking vampires.

19:32.289 --> 19:34.359
Wow, that was something.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.250
But no victims?
That's where you lose me.

19:38.289 --> 19:41.170
- Who are you?
- I'm Darla and this is Drusilla.

19:41.289 --> 19:43.960
Some of you know us by reputation.

19:44.890 --> 19:46.890
I never heard of you before.

19:49.089 --> 19:50.700
Now you never will.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.579
I trust we have everyone's attention.

19:56.289 --> 19:57.339
Good.

19:57.490 --> 20:00.400
We've come with a little proposition.

20:06.809 --> 20:09.970
Me and my girl aren't just
the new thing in town...

20:11.009 --> 20:14.730
...we're the only thing in town.
And we're in the market for some--

20:15.210 --> 20:19.710
Well, one doesn't really want to
use the term "muscular slaves."

20:21.210 --> 20:23.000
Actually, one does.

20:23.609 --> 20:25.710
We're only looking for the best.

20:26.009 --> 20:29.910
Those creatures who not only excel
at devastation, but revel in it.

20:31.410 --> 20:34.779
Our crusade is one of malevolent joy.

20:35.609 --> 20:39.859
- Eyes like needles.
- Dru, I'm working here.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.710
He sees you. Sees what you were.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.529
- He'll never be alone again.
- Stop.

20:50.609 --> 20:52.289
Just don't.

20:52.410 --> 20:55.359
He's watching you, my sweet,
right now.

21:01.410 --> 21:02.569
Angel.

21:04.410 --> 21:05.950
He wants to punish us.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.460
He thinks we've been naughty.

21:11.009 --> 21:14.519
- He remembers when you were warm.
- Shut up!

21:17.009 --> 21:20.910
As I was saying, if you think
you have what it takes to join us...

21:21.809 --> 21:24.410
...auditions are tonight,
at this address.

21:24.809 --> 21:27.059
Winners get to foment
mass destruction.

21:27.809 --> 21:30.059
Losers will be gutted
and left for dead.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.490
Have a nice night. Come on.

21:42.809 --> 21:43.789
I'm not ready,

21:44.009 --> 21:44.779
Angel.

21:45.809 --> 21:47.839
I can still feel her,

21:48.809 --> 21:50.180
Her pain,

21:51.210 --> 21:52.579
Her need,

21:53.609 --> 21:54.940
Her hope,

21:56.009 --> 21:57.450
I'm too close,

21:59.009 --> 22:00.240
Too close to fight her,

22:13.650 --> 22:14.730
Lilah.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.400
Something happen?

22:22.650 --> 22:24.789
I can't do it anymore, Lindsey.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.140
- Do what?
- The waiting.

22:35.849 --> 22:37.220
I sit in my office...

22:37.650 --> 22:40.839
...and every time there's a noise
or the phone rings....

22:42.450 --> 22:44.980
- One of us is gonna die.
- Everybody dies.

22:45.450 --> 22:48.400
But not everybody ends up
turned into dog food.

22:49.049 --> 22:52.700
You got a 50-50 chance of surviving
this thing, just like me.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.420
It's not good enough.

22:56.849 --> 22:58.569
- There's a way out.
- How?

22:59.250 --> 23:03.319
We don't wait for them to choose.
We choose each other instead.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.150
If we stick together, we can win.

23:08.250 --> 23:11.089
We could leave. You and me, tonight.

23:11.250 --> 23:14.059
- They'd have no choice--
- They'd hunt us down.

23:14.849 --> 23:17.869
No. Not if we took files
as insurance.

23:18.450 --> 23:20.059
- Take files?
- Yes.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.849
Look, I've heard the rumors.

23:27.450 --> 23:30.119
We both know it worked for you
once before.

23:31.049 --> 23:34.240
You knew just what to take.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.569
You won't have to assume
any of the risk.

23:38.849 --> 23:41.900
Just tell me which files
to steal, and I'll get them.

23:43.049 --> 23:45.299
And then we can get out of here...

23:46.049 --> 23:49.069
...and this mess, together.

23:52.049 --> 23:52.920
Are you in?

24:03.450 --> 24:07.349
Lilah, I would never steal files.
I'm shocked at the suggestion.

24:13.049 --> 24:14.980
Forget about the frame job.

24:15.450 --> 24:17.839
They're gonna kill who they want.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.160
Just take it like a man.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.119
But see,

24:25.049 --> 24:24.119
That's what I'm saying. If Wesley
hadn't been shaking his finger...

24:25.490 --> 24:28.789
That's what I'm saying. If Wesley
hadn't been shaking his finger...

24:29.089 --> 24:33.089
...and no, no, no, this whole
Darla thing would have just...

24:33.890 --> 24:34.799
...blown over.

24:35.089 --> 24:36.279
- What?
- Blown over?

24:36.890 --> 24:39.490
- Obsessions don't just blow over.
- Right.

24:40.490 --> 24:44.990
Well, you certainly didn't help
by making him feel guilty about it.

24:45.890 --> 24:47.920
You shamed him into firing us.

24:48.890 --> 24:51.519
- You're blaming this on me?
- Not blaming--

24:52.490 --> 24:54.980
Yes, I'm blaming you.
You get the blame.

24:55.490 --> 24:59.630
If I had to listen to you two,
day in, day out, bitch, bitch, bitch!

25:02.089 --> 25:03.839
I would have killed you.

25:06.289 --> 25:08.039
That's rich, coming from...

25:08.089 --> 25:11.180
...Mr. I-Don't-Take-Orders-
Now-Where-Do-I-Stick-My-Ax?

25:11.690 --> 25:13.720
- What do you mean?
- You've never...

25:14.690 --> 25:17.569
...been very supportive
of Angel's leadership role.

25:18.289 --> 25:20.109
- I remember a shroud--
- Hold on.

25:20.089 --> 25:22.119
Are you saying this is my fault?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.690
Well, you won't follow his directives.

25:26.089 --> 25:29.460
Was one of his directives,
"Hire pansy-ass British guy"?

25:30.289 --> 25:31.730
My ass is not pansy.

25:35.089 --> 25:37.230
- You kids need another round?
- Yes!

25:40.490 --> 25:41.430
What about her?

25:41.690 --> 25:43.299
Maybe if she'd had visions...

25:44.089 --> 25:47.420
...Angel would've been too distracted
to think about Darla.

25:47.690 --> 25:52.259
You have an obsession, you squeeze it
into your schedule, no matter what!

25:53.089 --> 25:57.480
- So you admit it's an obsession?
- No. I mean, yes, but no.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.099
- Hypocrite.
- Ass-pansy!

26:09.890 --> 26:12.589
We are the champions

26:12.890 --> 26:15.700
We are the champions

26:16.490 --> 26:19.160
No time for losers

26:20.089 --> 26:23.740
Cuz we are the champions

26:29.089 --> 26:30.740
Vampires.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.519
Sloth demons.

26:34.490 --> 26:36.910
You know what's really, really evil?

26:39.289 --> 26:40.619
Tequila.

26:45.890 --> 26:48.099
- I need to be dead now.
- Well, well.

26:48.289 --> 26:52.609
I can see the maudlin segment
of tonight's binge is in full swing.

26:53.690 --> 26:55.299
Oh, don't be blue.

26:56.089 --> 26:59.569
I was very impressed with your
musical recitation of pain.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.680
And when I say pain,
I mean mine.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.829
You sang your hearts out.

27:05.089 --> 27:08.109
Yeah. Our hearts were out.

27:10.490 --> 27:13.819
You, Mr. Big Mojo Guy...

27:14.690 --> 27:18.940
...are supposed to
give us guidance now.

27:20.089 --> 27:20.960
She's right.

27:21.289 --> 27:24.170
We came, we sang, we--

27:26.089 --> 27:28.339
We fought the urge to regurgitate.

27:29.089 --> 27:30.700
So spill, already. Not you.

27:33.890 --> 27:38.210
What are we supposed to do with
our lives? Where do we go from here?

27:38.690 --> 27:41.359
Oh, I'd love to tell you, sweetie.

27:42.289 --> 27:46.289
But when the big guys talk,
I shut my yap.

27:47.089 --> 27:50.000
And they're about to get real chatty.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.900
- You all right?
- No!

27:59.369 --> 28:02.349
- What'd you see?
- Alley.

28:02.970 --> 28:04.269
Not too far from here.

28:04.769 --> 28:08.630
A demon's dragging a girl.
She's hurt. Bleeding.

28:09.569 --> 28:10.650
Let's go.

28:37.970 --> 28:40.430
I don't get it.
Are we late?

28:40.970 --> 28:43.990
- We didn't feel late in my head.
- Over here.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.400
It's hers.

28:49.369 --> 28:51.900
It's gotta be hers. But where is she?

28:52.369 --> 28:56.160
- If we had Angel, we could track her.
- He'd also kill that demon.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.130
Did I mention his teeth?

28:59.569 --> 29:03.190
- I wish Angel was here.
- Well, he's not.

29:06.769 --> 29:11.269
Angel's walked away from
his duty. We're not going to.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.700
- So how do we find her?
- Start with basics.

29:18.170 --> 29:21.259
First, we examine the area
for any tell-tale signs...

29:21.769 --> 29:23.380
...of a particular kind of--

29:24.769 --> 29:25.609
Ew.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.789
There's different kinds of "ew"?

29:28.369 --> 29:29.630
No. Look.

29:32.569 --> 29:33.970
He took her up there.

29:34.369 --> 29:37.420
The building's abandoned.
The front door was chained.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.579
How are we supposed to--?

29:43.369 --> 29:45.619
I didn't like that barkeeper.

29:45.769 --> 29:48.400
Can't get his eyes off my fingers.

29:49.369 --> 29:52.390
It's nearly midnight.
We should get to the factory.

29:52.970 --> 29:54.440
My little bird is anxious.

29:54.769 --> 29:57.299
Recruiting demons is stressful, Dru.

29:57.769 --> 30:00.019
- He won't leave.
- I don't wanna hear it.

30:00.769 --> 30:04.740
We could have 1000 soldiers,
and he'll still come. Galloping.

30:05.569 --> 30:07.079
Who says this is about Angel?

30:07.369 --> 30:10.559
Can't I wreak havoc without
him being involved?

30:10.970 --> 30:13.430
You miss him, like a heartbeat.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.789
I don't miss my heartbeat.

30:16.369 --> 30:20.059
It was a symptom of a disease
I've been cured of.

30:22.970 --> 30:25.359
In a perfect world,
Angel would be here...

30:25.369 --> 30:27.509
...helping me torch this city.

30:28.369 --> 30:32.230
It's his job. But where is he?
Probably flogging himself in church.

30:33.170 --> 30:36.150
Ooh, flogging! Ooh, churches....

30:36.769 --> 30:39.019
We should be slaughtering
the innocent.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.910
Laughing, as we rain
destruction on this town.

30:42.769 --> 30:44.940
I see such pretty fire.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.059
Fire. Conflagration.

30:47.569 --> 30:50.549
In a perfect world, there'd
be nothing here but ashes.

30:51.170 --> 30:52.710
And pain.

30:53.569 --> 30:56.200
So much suffering.

30:56.569 --> 30:58.990
The flames are lovely.

30:59.569 --> 31:03.400
They dance, and the fire
licks like a cat.

31:04.369 --> 31:05.740
And the screams.

31:05.569 --> 31:08.410
Oh, it's like star music.

31:09.170 --> 31:10.890
That's nice, Dru.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.710
Now hurry up. We can't be late.

31:39.769 --> 31:43.420
It's always the same. A smelly,
old, abandoned building.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.250
Are there no hideouts
in Beverly Hills?

31:46.970 --> 31:49.289
Several, as a matter-- Look.

31:49.970 --> 31:50.839
Over there.

31:51.769 --> 31:53.349
That's her. But where's the--?

32:01.970 --> 32:03.480
Get her out of here!

32:10.970 --> 32:11.839
Come on, we--

32:45.890 --> 32:47.819
- Get her to a hospital.
- Yeah.

32:48.289 --> 32:50.890
- What about you?
- I'm fine. It's just--

32:53.089 --> 32:57.130
We should go before I pass out.
Or possibly during.

32:57.890 --> 32:59.539
Nearly ripped us to shreds.

32:59.690 --> 33:02.710
But out of everybody here,
which one of us is dead?

33:10.369 --> 33:12.089
Let's make this quick, okay?

33:12.769 --> 33:16.740
We weed out the losers and get out.
I've got little patience left.

33:18.769 --> 33:20.700
Oh, it's beautiful!

33:23.569 --> 33:26.059
Dank and dark.
It reeks of death.

33:28.369 --> 33:30.049
That's motor oil, Dru.

33:31.369 --> 33:34.420
Could we buy it?
It could be our castle.

33:34.970 --> 33:36.019
We're broke.

33:36.170 --> 33:39.500
Though I suppose Lindsey
could help out in that respect.

33:40.369 --> 33:44.410
- If they haven't killed him yet.
- I like the girl. She's wicked.

33:45.170 --> 33:48.009
Sweet kids. Naive,
but they're only human.

33:48.769 --> 33:52.880
I doubt they know what Wolfram
& Hart's true plan for Angel is.

33:54.170 --> 33:57.119
But I have to say,
my curiosity is piqued.

34:04.970 --> 34:08.340
Ten little soldiers all in a line

34:09.170 --> 34:12.500
A shot rings out, down to nine

34:13.369 --> 34:14.599
Ten?

34:15.170 --> 34:18.119
I'd be happy if we can find three
who can hack it.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.219
Dead already?

34:31.969 --> 34:33.159
Bad soldiers!

34:46.969 --> 34:48.619
I should have known.

34:49.969 --> 34:50.980
A shadow.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.518
Why so far away, my love?

34:54.170 --> 34:57.190
Why don't you come over here
and stake me?

35:01.369 --> 35:03.050
Angel?

35:06.769 --> 35:08.769
Angelus?

35:55.969 --> 35:58.739
Make it stop, please!

36:00.170 --> 36:02.059
That wasn't Angel.

36:02.570 --> 36:05.550
He's gone. He's all gone.

36:09.170 --> 36:10.889
It hurts!

36:11.570 --> 36:13.039
It hurts!

36:13.969 --> 36:16.530
It wasn't Angelus, either.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.489
Darla, help me!

36:21.170 --> 36:23.449
Help me, please....

36:26.570 --> 36:28.179
Who was that?

36:48.610 --> 36:50.360
- And the fire?
- They're alive.

36:51.010 --> 36:52.059
- Undead.
- Whatever.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.329
- It was Angel.
- So?

36:54.010 --> 36:56.679
Killed a dozen demons.
Set the girls on fire.

36:57.010 --> 36:59.469
- Your point?
- A little grimmer than usual.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.360
- Holland's vision lives.
- Screw it.

37:03.010 --> 37:05.960
If anybody's going down,
it's gonna be you.

37:06.610 --> 37:08.289
If that's what it takes.

37:15.010 --> 37:17.010
Sit down.

37:28.210 --> 37:29.719
I suppose you know why you're here.

37:30.610 --> 37:33.280
The senior partners have decided...

37:34.210 --> 37:37.260
...that this should be a time
of grief and reflection.

37:37.809 --> 37:40.059
We can never replace Holland Manners.

37:40.809 --> 37:44.250
He was a man of extraordinary talents.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.210
This leaves us with
an opening in our roster.

37:49.210 --> 37:51.599
We need an executive vice president...

37:52.210 --> 37:54.489
...of special projects.

37:56.409 --> 37:57.489
Mr. McDonald...

38:03.610 --> 38:07.469
...your conduct at this firm
has proved spotty, at best.

38:08.409 --> 38:11.570
You've stolen files,
cooperated with our enemy...

38:12.010 --> 38:14.780
...and disobeyed orders
time and again.

38:17.409 --> 38:21.199
Miss Morgan, when you drove away
the telekinetic Bethany Chaulk...

38:22.210 --> 38:24.530
...you lost us a powerful
potential assassin.

38:25.809 --> 38:29.250
Both of you have been negligent
about informing us...

38:30.010 --> 38:31.900
...of visits from certain ladies.

38:32.409 --> 38:34.199
Who, lest we forget...

38:34.809 --> 38:37.929
...ate the majority of our
contracts department.

38:41.409 --> 38:44.670
The truth is, neither one
of you are qualified...

38:45.010 --> 38:46.690
...to run special projects.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.750
As for your relationship
to one another...

38:51.010 --> 38:52.800
...your competition has been...

38:53.409 --> 38:56.570
...vicious, destructive and...

38:57.010 --> 38:59.010
...healthy for each other.

38:59.409 --> 39:01.059
That's why we've decided...

39:01.809 --> 39:04.789
...to appoint you both as
acting co-vice presidents...

39:05.409 --> 39:09.449
...until such time as we see fit
to narrow it down.

39:13.210 --> 39:16.400
Congratulations.
This is a big step.

39:17.409 --> 39:21.030
The senior partners
will be watching you.

39:51.449 --> 39:54.329
We're keeping the agency open.

39:55.650 --> 39:57.789
With or without you.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.869
You've turned your back
on your mission, but we haven't.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.260
Someone has to fight the good fight.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.980
Let them fight the good fight,

40:29.849 --> 40:31.880
Someone has to fight the war,

41:10.650 --> 41:12.579
Thank you very much,

41:13.305 --> 41:19.408
