00:52.302 --> 00:56.014
Mom's not gonna eat cupcakes that have
clearly been fingered by tiny hands.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.140
They're for me.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.393
It's stressful being the buffer
between you two.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.603
I've only been doing it my whole life.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.605
I've been a buffer for you.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.316
I mean, remember that time
I came with you to confront Mom

01:06.400 --> 01:07.776
when you secretly gave her that loan?

01:07.859 --> 01:10.237
You had to know she was gonna find out.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.366
Look, Mallory, not to get super dark,
but I thought she'd die first.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.622
Hey, so what happened
with square-jawed Ryan?

01:20.706 --> 01:23.584
Nothing. Just a bunch of sex and stuff.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.751
Good for you.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.212
I know. He has, like, 17 abs.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.716
Was it hot? Was it fun?
Was it hot and fun?

01:30.799 --> 01:34.720
It was... many things.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.306
Wow, this is the least graphic
you've ever been.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.600
Where are the disgusting,
yet creative, descriptors?

01:40.684 --> 01:43.520
I may have just gotten more discreet
in my old age.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.774
-His penis had abs.
-There it is.

02:04.499 --> 02:08.587
Hi, Mommy, who inspires me
every day to be a better Brianna.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.591
You had no right to get involved
in my business.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.510
Okay, I see we're diving right in there.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.804
Mom, I wasn't trying to get involved.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.641
I was trying to help you out.
Where's Frankie?

02:20.724 --> 02:22.351
-Frankie!
-She's not here.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.728
-Where is she?
-Don't know, don't care.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.356
Typical Frankie,
leaving when the heat's at the door.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.567
She's probably halfway to Borrego
right now, wearing one of her moustaches.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.987
You know, I never would have taken
that money if I'd known it was from you.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.657
I know and that's why I didn't tell you.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.660
-That's smart, right?
-No!

02:41.453 --> 02:44.164
What does it matter
where the money came from?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.499
It matters.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.175
Can I just say,

02:55.258 --> 02:57.177
in terms of terrible things
Brianna's done,

02:57.260 --> 02:59.221
giving you money
isn't exactly at the top of the list.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.138
Thank you!

03:00.222 --> 03:02.349
So what, exactly, is the problem?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.517
The problem.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.185
You want to know what the problem is?

03:06.812 --> 03:11.608
The problem is... children aren't
supposed to do this for parents.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.902
Parents are supposed to do this
for children.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.239
Mom, at a certain point
aren't we supposed to do things for you?

03:17.322 --> 03:20.784
Because we love you
and you gave us life...

03:21.660 --> 03:23.161
and good hair.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.039
Maybe it's getting to be that time.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.128
It is not "that time."

03:31.211 --> 03:33.880
Do you understand me?
It is not "that time"!

03:33.964 --> 03:36.758
We are not at "that time."

03:40.887 --> 03:42.723
He's dead, Mom. You got him.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.812
I want to take this away.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.900
So we started off in a classic standoff.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.153
I was looking at him,
he was looking at me,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.279
giving me the stink eye.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.448
No one was backing down.

03:59.531 --> 04:03.827
And then I remembered what my therapist
said about being more authoritative,

04:03.910 --> 04:05.203
so I stood my ground.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.875
I said, "You hairless monster.
You poop in the litter box!"

04:09.958 --> 04:13.003
-Whoa.
-Yeah. And ever since then, guess what?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.921
Gregory poops in the litter box.

04:15.005 --> 04:19.801
No, no, no. He still poops in my shoes,
but I can tell he feels horrible about it.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.221
You are a tough one.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.681
You can be tough, too.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.434
Well, I have to be. I'm the boss now.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.020
You want to try bossing me around?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.272
Maybe.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.149
Pour me some more wine, please.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.526
No, no, not please. Not please.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.529
Pour me some more wine.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.240
If you insist.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.997
Is this low-histamine wine
cooperating with your allergies?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.250
No, I'm completely inflamed.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.335
Hmm.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.968
Oh, Bud, I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to be here--

05:02.052 --> 05:04.513
Coyote, you are such an ass--
Mom?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.932
I know. I am an ass-mom.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.059
But she called me really freaking out.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.727
-What's wrong?
-I'm bleeding!

05:10.811 --> 05:12.521
-What?!
-Emotionally.

05:12.604 --> 05:16.817
Ahh, Mom, we talked about the difference
between physical and emotional bleeding.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.987
-What the hell's going on?
-I think a fight with Grace?

05:21.071 --> 05:24.658
I don't know, it's hard to say.
She was rambling like a prison letter.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.369
You need to get her out of here
because I had an evening planned.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.455
Bud, this is not about you.
Something happened.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.415
My dummy exploded.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.378
It's crazy how often
she has cause to say that.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.046
Hi, Allison.

05:38.129 --> 05:38.964
Hi.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.507
How's your ichthyosis?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.301
Drying up. I'm starting to slough.

05:43.385 --> 05:47.013
-How are you?
-Oh! My roommate has a gun!

05:47.097 --> 05:49.224
Like a real gun
or like an emotional kind of--

05:49.307 --> 05:52.435
Uh, right now, in this moment,
is there something that I need to do?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.105
-Because if not--
-Yes. No. Yes.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.276
Look, team, I will tell you everything
in a moment, but I'm beat.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.779
-Of course. Yeah, use Bud's bed.
-Uh...

06:02.862 --> 06:05.240
Bud was kind of planning on
using Bud's bed.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.367
Oh, thank you, Coyote.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.496
Oh, rose petals!

06:11.580 --> 06:13.331
Oh, thank you, Bud.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.750
Well, where are we gonna fuck?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.462
Allison, um... I'm on this.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.174
Just give me a second to put out this
non-fire and I will be right with you.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.636
Bud! I didn't know you had silk sheets.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.431
Okay. Well, I think I'm gonna head out.

06:29.514 --> 06:33.143
Okay, just give me an hour
and then come back.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.229
If you'd like, consider that an order.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.315
I like.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.234
See you in an hour.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.992
Oh, look at that,
her ichthyosis really does look better.

06:53.038 --> 06:56.124
According to my mother,
your mother has a gun. Is this true?

06:56.207 --> 06:58.001
Wait, Frankie found Louise?

06:58.084 --> 07:01.546
<i>-Your mother's gun is named Louise?</i>
-Your brother's name is Coyote?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.924
-Did Grace mention a shooting?
<i>-No.</i>

07:05.008 --> 07:07.677
-Is that why Frankie's not here?
<i>-We're still piecing it together.</i>

07:07.761 --> 07:09.721
All I know is that my bed,

07:09.804 --> 07:11.765
which I specifically
re-pillowed for Allison,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.016
<i>is now occupied by my mother.</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:17.479
And the fact that this is a problem
is somehow lost on my brother.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.813
Oh, I've stopped listening.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.025
Ooh...

07:24.653 --> 07:28.198
Did something happen
between you and Frankie and Louise?

07:29.074 --> 07:30.075
Mom...

07:32.702 --> 07:34.704
Did you take a shot at Frankie?

07:34.788 --> 07:39.960
Please, she was barely in the house
when the firearm discharged.

07:40.043 --> 07:43.213
I could feel the heat of the bullets
whizzing by my head!

07:43.296 --> 07:46.216
You shot at your best friend?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.133
No!

07:47.217 --> 07:50.804
I shot at an extremely life-like piÃ±ata.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.808
Oh, it looked just like me.
She knew what she was doing.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.019
She is a dangerous, menacing lunatic.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.354
Has she called?

07:59.437 --> 08:01.815
I'm not calling her.
I need another drink.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.400
Or...

08:03.483 --> 08:04.317
What?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.361
We could smoke all of Frankie's pot.

08:06.444 --> 08:10.532
I promised her if I ever smoked the pot
I would do it with her.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.702
Or... it's a double "fuck you."

08:13.785 --> 08:15.870
I don't care for that language...

08:17.455 --> 08:18.790
but fuck her!

08:18.873 --> 08:20.875
You know what might help you right now?

08:20.959 --> 08:23.378
A nice, long cuddle--

08:23.461 --> 08:26.131
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.676
With Jacob! You know,
your boyfriend at his home.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.513
-He's a little upset with me.
-Oy.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.726
Mom, I think what you and Brianna
tried to do for Grace was nice.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.478
Oh, thank you, son-friend.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.980
I think so, too.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.608
Maybe you guys could go think thoughts
someplace together! Like a Denny's.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.278
Bud, she's really shaken up.

08:48.361 --> 08:53.074
Normally, I'm not wild about being
talked about in the third person...

08:53.825 --> 08:56.536
but "she" is really shaken up.

08:56.619 --> 09:00.457
Would a little music therapy
be good right about now?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.042
You mean a jam sesh?

09:02.125 --> 09:05.962
No, no, no, let's not turn this into
one of Coyote's sad open mic nights.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.297
They're not sad.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.300
Uh, you have to pay to perform.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.802
Do you still know<i> "</i>Sister Golden Hair"?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.512
Just the intro.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.390
That's cool, just play a bunch of that.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.517
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:19.601 --> 09:20.477
Mom!

09:20.560 --> 09:23.271
I've got an idea.
What if I get you a hotel room?

09:23.354 --> 09:26.316
A nice comfortable bed, free cable?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.817
Room service?

09:28.443 --> 09:32.655
You and the, uh, "band" could trash it.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.495
Put the word "vegan" before "room service"
and you've got yourself a deal.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.956
Oh, wait, there's<i> Rizzoli--</i>

09:42.040 --> 09:44.542
<i>- </i><i>He lied to me!</i>
<i>- All About Eve--</i>

09:44.626 --> 09:47.378
<i>- </i><i> And it's out of here!</i>
- The Padres.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.381
Think you could pick a channel
and stick with it?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.929
-Robert.
-Hmm?

09:56.012 --> 10:00.975
You abused your power as the remote holder
and now I'm taking it.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.143
Hey, I'm watching that.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.772
Yes, well, I'm sorry to pull you away

10:05.855 --> 10:10.777
from your new favorite Korean soap opera
with no subtitles, but we need to talk.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.404
I can figure out
what they're saying from context.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.365
It's the hallmark of good storytelling.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.284
Like, for example,
you see that fellow on the phone?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.703
He has a secret pet chicken named Doug,

10:20.787 --> 10:24.374
but animals are not allowed
in his building so he's deeply ashamed.

10:24.457 --> 10:29.337
Is it possible you're projecting
onto this nice Korean gentleman and Doug?

10:29.420 --> 10:31.214
I am not.

10:31.297 --> 10:36.052
Right. So the fugue state you've been in
has nothing to do with your mother?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.805
That's right.
I told her the truth.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.225
She reacted horribly like I knew
she would and that's that.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.395
She's your mother, for God's sake.
How could you not be affected by her?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.647
Listen, Sol, I know you're trying to help,

10:47.730 --> 10:51.734
but really, I don't want
to think about her anymore, okay?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.406
All right.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.199
If that's what you want.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.620
I'm sorry.
You've been very patient with me

11:02.704 --> 11:04.581
and I shouldn't take it all out on you.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.166
That's what I'm here for.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.339
How about we make
a romantic evening of it?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.635
-You'd be up for that?
-And why wouldn't I be?

11:17.719 --> 11:22.140
I don't know. I guess you haven't seemed
terribly interested in romance lately.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.601
Actually, not since we moved in.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.979
Really? No. Didn't we--

11:28.062 --> 11:29.522
The night Peter was here?

11:29.606 --> 11:30.607
Nope.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.445
Oh. The night I brought home
lobster tails?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.572
That was in the old house.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
Really? Oh my.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.743
They were good tails.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.745
You drank the melted butter.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.788
You saw that?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.582
-I see everything.
-All right.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.917
We're gonna fix this right now.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.586
You and I are going to make
a delicious dinner,

11:51.669 --> 11:53.880
then afterwards,
we're gonna light some candles

11:53.963 --> 11:56.925
and then pop a nice,
chilled bottle of champagne.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.970
You mean the gateway drug to romance?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
You've caught my drift.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.934
You all right with missing your program?

12:06.017 --> 12:09.938
I've seen this one before.
It does not end well for the chicken.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.606
Come, my love.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.654
-That's it.
-Go, Mom!

12:26.329 --> 12:27.622
It's still not working.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.168
No, I told you the pot doesn't work on me.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.171
My mouth is dry.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.925
Marijuana's finally met its match:

12:39.008 --> 12:40.551
Grace Hanson.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.596
There's not enough weed in this world
to relax that woman.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.601
-So?
-So what?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.688
-Are you gonna see him again?
-See who?

12:51.771 --> 12:52.939
The guy with the penis abs.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.858
Jesus, Mallory.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.277
What are you not telling me?
Was he bad at sex?

12:58.361 --> 13:01.698
No. He was very professional.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.907
Then what's the problem?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.493
He was... a professional.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.786
Like a lawyer?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.039
Well, yeah, sort of like a lawyer.
He charged me $300 for the hour.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.167
I'm too stoned to play this game.
What are you saying?

13:13.251 --> 13:14.627
He was a working man.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.588
A man of the night.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.341
Has a heart of gold.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.094
Jesus, Mallory, he's a hooker.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.805
-What?
-Shh.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.599
Do you really want Mom
to find out that I'm a Jean?

13:28.683 --> 13:29.559
What's a Jean?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.311
It's a female John. Can you keep up?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.189
Do you know what I just realized?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.859
The kitchen is still clean.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.445
It's been clean all day.

13:40.528 --> 13:44.824
The same amount of time
Frankie's been gone.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.869
Man, I could get used to this.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.037
You say that now.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.288
You'd miss her.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.539
You'd miss...

13:53.499 --> 13:54.333
her.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.129
Hair in my brush? Paint in my shower?

13:58.212 --> 13:59.881
Her in my shower?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.924
Shower in my kitchen?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.011
Do you know what I would pay
for some peace and quiet around here?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.721
Three hundred dollars?

14:07.889 --> 14:12.560
Or, you could pay nothing
because you'd hate living alone.

14:12.643 --> 14:16.022
And you'd have no one
to boss around or shoot at.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.316
I wouldn't hate living alone.
I've done it already.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.110
-When?
-With your father.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.238
Ouf.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.742
There's nothing like being
with somebody and still feeling alone.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.495
I know.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.372
What's wrong?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.708
Everything and nothing, you know?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.544
Just... everything and nothing.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.297
Ouf.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.300
No, no, no to that.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.094
No to loneliness.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.304
I have a husband and a billion kids!

14:48.388 --> 14:50.306
And you're not lonely!

14:50.390 --> 14:53.059
I bet you never feel alone
when you're with Frankie.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.311
Huh. No.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.605
Then what are you doing?
You have a Frankie.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.315
I wish I had a Frankie.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.109
I am...

15:03.653 --> 15:06.280
I mean, I thought I was your Frankie.

15:06.364 --> 15:10.701
You are. You are.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.789
See, Mom?
Don't you want this with Frankie?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.165
Why?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.458
I have it with you.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.546
We're having it right now.

15:21.629 --> 15:26.843
Maybe the three of us can finally be close
like I've heard families can get.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.388
You know, we can hang out more,
just like tonight.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.099
And we can smoke the pot
and have the talks.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.101
Maybe we could start a book club.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.773
Get your fucking mother over here.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.489
Hey, hey, Mom.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.619
Want to go for a ride in the trunk?

15:53.703 --> 15:57.373
Yeah! No! Wait, where are we going?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.749
To the beach house.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.169
Oh, hell-to-the-nah.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.174
Fuck! That's Allison.
It's been an hour already?

16:06.257 --> 16:09.635
It's been 87 minutes.
For some reason, I know that.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.972
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.766
-This is being fixed, I promise.
-Let's just call it a night.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.435
There's a lot going on here.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.104
She's talking about our tasty riffs.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.941
-Okay, everybody, let's go.
-I'm not going to the beach.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.194
-Then you're going to the vegan hotel.
-All right.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.155
But first we have to go to CVS
for a toothbrush,

16:29.238 --> 16:31.616
and then to Target
for a new pair of pajamas...

16:31.699 --> 16:33.367
-Mom, no--
-...and then back to CVS

16:33.451 --> 16:34.911
because I always forget something.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.871
Good, and you know I need some ChapStick.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.456
Oh, I actually have some ChapStick.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.291
Wait! Wait.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.627
Let me be direct.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.631
Mom, we're gonna go back to the beach
house, you're gonna grab your things,

16:46.714 --> 16:48.424
and both of you are gonna go
to the vegan hotel,

16:48.508 --> 16:51.219
where I'm sure there will be
cruelty-free ChapStick.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.570
Hello, my love.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.783
Hey, there.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.827
You notice anything different about me?

17:18.663 --> 17:21.374
Other than the way
you're flirting with that doorway?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.835
I'm wearing silk, Sol.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.422
Not cotton, not flannel, but silk.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.425
Nature's sexiest fabric.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.554
It clings in all the right places.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.849
Actually, it clings in all places.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.151
Very nice.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.529
The pajamas are nice, too.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.373
What's wrong?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.005
-What is it?
-Ah, nothing.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.049
I have some heartburn.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.970
I'll make some tea. Excuse me.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.020
Hmm.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.235
Isn't this fun?

18:31.319 --> 18:32.987
Yeah. We can do you next.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.864
No, we're doing Brianna next.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.783
No, I think Brianna's gonna pass on...

18:37.867 --> 18:39.327
She calls it "Jamaica hair."

18:39.410 --> 18:41.203
It's Jamaica hair.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.206
Ooh, but, look,
here's someone who might like it.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.208
We just came to get my mom's weed.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.170
Okay.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.339
I think we found it.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.049
I smoked on it, too.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.302
You said you'd never smoke without me.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.556
But then you also said
you didn't have a gun either, so...

19:00.640 --> 19:04.810
Whoo, whoo! Braid train!
Frankie, climb aboard!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.479
An emphatic "No, thank you"

19:06.562 --> 19:09.607
followed by "You really should
look in a mirror."

19:11.150 --> 19:14.236
-No.
-Remember what I did to those lifeguards

19:14.320 --> 19:17.448
who tried to block me
from double-tubing down that lazy river?

19:17.531 --> 19:20.368
-Yes.
-This has to stop.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.661
And you want to know why?

19:21.744 --> 19:25.289
Because the two of you love each other.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.166
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I said it. Love.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.336
L-O-V-E. L-U-V if you're feeling sassy.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.796
I'm not feeling sassy.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.048
Oh, you're never feeling sassy.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.051
Well, you wouldn't know
what sassy looks like on me.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.053
Oh, why don't you eat a bowl of wangs!

19:39.136 --> 19:40.346
Bud, we should go.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.015
"Bowl of wangs" is how it started
with those lifeguards.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.518
This is ridiculous.
You two are best friends!

19:45.601 --> 19:50.398
And everyone who knows you can see that,
even if we don't understand how.

19:50.481 --> 19:53.693
Yeah, Mom, come on. You were just saying
how much Frankie means to you.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.529
She said she never-- Ow.
She said she nev-- Ow!

19:56.612 --> 19:58.906
She said she never felt alone
when she was with you. Mom.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.783
That's a really nice thing
for Grace to say,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.994
and she wouldn't have pulled so hard
on Mallory's hair if it wasn't true.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.664
Now, I know you're upset about the gun

20:06.747 --> 20:09.792
and no one here
is trying to minimize that.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.629
May I ask what is so funny?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.965
You look just like your dummy right now.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.342
What? Is there a hole in my face?

20:18.426 --> 20:21.762
Oh, yes! And it's going, "Wah wah wah..."

20:21.846 --> 20:25.057
-Oh, God. The pot's kicking in.
-No, no, no, it doesn't affect me.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.185
Yeah, it does, Mom. It does.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.604
-Let's go for a walk. Yeah.
-Wah!

20:30.688 --> 20:33.065
-You gotta stop doing that, Mom.
-Choo-choo!

20:33.149 --> 20:34.650
Oh, this is madness.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.318
Mom. Mom!

20:37.820 --> 20:40.489
She's high.
She's not making fun of you, okay?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.241
People say crazy things when they're high.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.411
I say some of my most profound shit
when I'm high!

20:45.494 --> 20:47.079
Well, that's--

20:47.163 --> 20:48.539
It's Allison.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.334
Hey, baby, can you hang on one sec?

20:52.418 --> 20:55.296
Hey, Bud, I have my therapist,
Dr. Huang, on the line.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.756
<i>Dr. Huang, are you there?</i>

20:58.841 --> 21:00.885
He's there, he just always
hits the mute button with his face.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.970
And why is Dr. Huang on the line?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.805
<i>Oops! Sorry about that. I'm here.</i>

21:04.889 --> 21:07.516
Dr. Huang wants to talk to you
about some of your family issues.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.145
<i>He thinks that your enmeshment with them</i>
<i>is what's holding us back.</i>

21:11.228 --> 21:15.483
<i> I withhold a formal diagnosis</i>
<i>until we have a chance to talk at length.</i>

21:15.566 --> 21:20.029
No. Allison, I will be home in 20 minutes,
27 minutes if there is traffic.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.783
Dr. Huang, it is lovely to meet you.
I have to hang up now.

21:23.866 --> 21:27.036
But-- No, Bud. Just wait. Come on--

21:27.119 --> 21:28.370
Coyote, you got this?

21:28.454 --> 21:29.497
Hard no.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.999
-Mom, Coyote's got this.
-No, Bud, I do not got this.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.877
You need to try, which is what you
should have done in the first place

21:34.960 --> 21:36.545
-when Mom called you.
-I did try!

21:36.629 --> 21:39.924
No, you didn't, you just brought her back
to my place and made me deal with it.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.384
Because I don't have a place.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.930
I know! And don't you think
it's about time to change that?

21:46.013 --> 21:48.140
-Hey.
-I'm trying to change that.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.683
I've been saving up.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.646
And blowing all of your savings on things
like new guitars for your open mic nights!

21:53.729 --> 21:55.231
Because the only thing
more pathetic than that

21:55.314 --> 21:57.441
is sleeping
on your brother's couch for 18 months!

21:57.525 --> 21:59.109
Boys, please!

21:59.193 --> 22:02.905
If you wanted me gone,
you could have said so at any time.

22:02.988 --> 22:07.034
But it's only an issue now
because you're finally getting laid.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.538
Congratulations on finding someone
more neurotic than you!

22:10.621 --> 22:13.082
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.752
Where are you gonna go?

22:17.628 --> 22:20.089
Stop it! Are you happy now?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.340
No, I'm not happy now.

22:21.423 --> 22:25.302
Mom, you need to fix this thing with Grace
or I'm gonna throw myself into the river.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.222
-The ocean's closer.
-Mom, I am serious.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.225
I am, too. I've tried with her.

22:31.308 --> 22:35.020
Well, try harder.
Or sell this place and move on.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.689
I'm not selling anything.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.858
And for the record, I don't need
to be the one to try harder.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.113
In 40 years, your father and I
never had a fight like this.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.907
You want to know why?
Because he would cave in to your tantrums.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.242
Tantrums?

22:48.325 --> 22:52.955
One more word and I'm not gonna
let you take me to my vegan hotel.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.666
Good! I have things to do.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.302
What's she staring at?

23:07.344 --> 23:08.804
Everything.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.476
Has anything she's said
in the last ten minutes made sense?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.228
She called me Shelley.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.813
You look like a Shelley.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.693
-I mean...
-Really?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.111
You don't not.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.158
Let's go.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Frankie, come on.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.622
No. I'm going to my hotel,
where I'm welcome.

23:34.705 --> 23:39.418
Where there's a deeply unsatisfying shower
and the trash compactor is a goat.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.795
No, no, no. Frankie.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.131
-What would it take to get you to stay?
-Nothing.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.592
I'm not interested
in living under the same roof

23:46.675 --> 23:50.679
with someone who does
shitty, sneaky things behind my back.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.266
I've already lived that nightmare.
I'm not doing that anymore.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.435
Then go home.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.729
I am home, sea witch.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.027
She locked us out.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.324
-Did you lock us out?
-Yeah, I did.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.409
Because you already locked me out--

24:12.493 --> 24:13.911
Please, don't say it.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.704
Metaphorically.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.082
You make all the decisions
for the business,

24:18.165 --> 24:22.002
you decide what's best for me,
and you don't include me.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.712
That's how you locked me out.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.923
Metaphorically.

24:26.006 --> 24:30.511
You decided to have a gun
without even telling me.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.305
How could I tell you?

24:33.389 --> 24:37.726
You pretend to be so open-minded,
but how often do you actually listen

24:37.810 --> 24:41.980
before you plug up your ears
or burst into song?

24:42.064 --> 24:43.399
Listen to what?

24:44.316 --> 24:47.152
To why I even have a gun to begin with.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.196
Well, I assume to blow holes in people.

24:50.656 --> 24:51.865
See?

24:51.949 --> 24:54.076
Okay, why do you have a gun?

24:54.159 --> 24:55.828
No, never mind.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.205
No! No backsies.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.251
Damn you, Grace!

25:02.334 --> 25:06.005
You've appealed
to my emotionally curious nature.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.095
I'm opening the door just a crack.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.479
So, Robert gave you the gun?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.235
When the kids went away to college.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.362
And, of course, he was never home.

25:30.446 --> 25:34.658
And even when he was, he was being gay
with Sol, not straight with me.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.535
Ha. Nice.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.620
Anyway, I was in that house,

25:38.704 --> 25:42.875
that big, horrible house
all by myself and I was scared.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.336
And Robert's solution
was to give me a gun.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.925
I guess because...
he couldn't give me anything else.

25:52.760 --> 25:58.307
But that was all I had all those years
to make me feel safe.

25:58.390 --> 26:03.061
But you don't live in that big,
horrible house anymore.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.522
You live with me.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.441
I know.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.612
I know. In a way nicer house.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.991
With a way nicer person.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.163
Who usually likes to be with me
all the time.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.291
Sometimes too much.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.378
But I like that.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.298
Sometimes too much.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.511
So why do you still need the gun?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.725
I guess I don't.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.229
Will you get rid of it?

26:47.397 --> 26:50.484
I will. I will.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.116
I promise.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.459
Did they just lock us out?

27:57.134 --> 27:58.510
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
