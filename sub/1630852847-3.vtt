00:08.008 --> 00:08.967
- Previously on "Bel-Air"...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.176
- Why are you taking his side?

00:10.218 --> 00:12.345
- I know why he acted
the way he did,

00:12.387 --> 00:14.597
but what's your excuse?

00:14.639 --> 00:15.640
- Mr. Smith.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.600
Welcome to the team.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.895
- "Haute Cuisine" is the top
food magazine in the country,

00:20.937 --> 00:22.480
and I have an interview
with them next week.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.107
Mom hooked it up.
- We definitely want you

00:24.149 --> 00:26.192
to, you know,
tone it down.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.028
- But that's what people love
about my cooking.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.447
- I don't think your family
is our target audience.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.741
- My family and I would like
to welcome you all to our home

00:32.782 --> 00:35.368
and to express
our sincere appreciation to you

00:35.410 --> 00:37.454
for your support
of my campaign

00:37.495 --> 00:39.289
for Los Angeles
district attorney.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.250
- I feel like that gives you
this responsibility

00:42.292 --> 00:44.669
to speak directly
to the Black community.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.839
- Let me search your bag.
- Bro.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.090
[dramatic music]

00:49.132 --> 00:50.258
- Nothing to hide, huh?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.301
- Told you I'd handle him.

00:51.343 --> 00:55.305
* *

00:59.893 --> 01:01.394
- How did the drugs
get in your bag?

01:01.436 --> 01:02.645
- I don't know
how the drugs got in my bag!

01:02.687 --> 01:03.772
- Okay, so then
how did you get the drugs?

01:03.813 --> 01:05.273
- Those are not my drugs.
I'm telling you,

01:05.315 --> 01:06.983
someone put the drugs
in my bag.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.526
If I'm lying,
I'm flying.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.904
No cap.
I put that on my mom,

01:10.945 --> 01:12.614
I put that on West Philly,
on everything I love.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.948
- Okay, then who else
could have done it?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.617
- I swear to God,
I had nothing to do with it.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.577
- Someone put the drugs
in my bag.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.454
- And what about Connor?
- What about Connor?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.498
- He was mad because I knocked
his ass out at the party,

01:21.539 --> 01:23.083
so he's trying to get me back.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.334
It's called retaliation.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.919
- This isn't
how Connor would retaliate.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.755
Sure, I could see him
freezing Will out socially

01:28.797 --> 01:30.965
and running his mouth,
but he wouldn't plant drugs

01:31.007 --> 01:33.510
in his backpack
like some Philly beat cop.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.220
- And if y'all don't believe
me, y'all can drug-test me.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.680
I'll piss in a cup right now.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.974
- If Will is telling the truth
and it wasn't Connor,

01:40.016 --> 01:41.643
do you have any idea of who
might be trying to frame him?

01:41.685 --> 01:44.562
- Turns out some people
actually think less of him

01:44.604 --> 01:46.648
after he attacked
me and Connor.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.734
- Let's stay on topic.
Who else could have done this?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.444
- Besides Connor?
both: Mm-hmm.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.614
- I mean, the only person
I can think of is Carlton.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.033
- I wouldn't do something
like this to him.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.119
[tense music]

01:59.160 --> 02:02.997
After all,
he's family.

02:03.039 --> 02:10.213
* *

02:13.174 --> 02:14.968
- Good morning,
Los Angeles.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.928
It's gonna be
a balmy 73 degrees

02:16.970 --> 02:18.430
in West Hollywood.
[alarm beeping]

02:18.471 --> 02:20.015
It's gonna shoot up
to 87 about noon.

02:20.056 --> 02:23.393
And traffic is piling up
on the 405 and the 10,

02:23.435 --> 02:25.186
Happy Friday,
Los Angeles.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.772
Let's all have
a beautiful day.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.154
[soft hip-hop music]

02:34.195 --> 02:35.864
- [sighs]

02:35.905 --> 02:39.034
[hurried footsteps]

02:39.075 --> 02:42.037
[gentle music]

02:42.078 --> 02:43.288
- Uh-uh.
Mm-mm.

02:43.329 --> 02:48.126
* *

02:48.168 --> 02:49.252
- Your aunt and I
are gonna get

02:49.294 --> 02:50.545
to the bottom
of this situation.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.714
Will, I know you're
in in-school suspension.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.674
We have a meeting
with your principal today,

02:54.716 --> 02:56.134
hopefully find some answers.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.678
- Carlton, you're gonna
ask around, too, right, honey?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.764
- Of course.
I hope whoever did this,

03:00.805 --> 03:04.559
or allegedly did this,
gets caught and punished.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.186
- And what if
it's someone you know?

03:06.227 --> 03:07.520
Do you still hope
they get caught?

03:07.562 --> 03:09.105
- Absolutely.
- Good.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.608
We're all committed to making
sure the truth comes to light.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.984
And if there is foul play,

03:13.026 --> 03:17.030
I promise,
there will be consequences.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.949
- Serious consequences.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.001
[school bell rings]

03:30.043 --> 03:32.170
- You should have told me
before you actually did it.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.380
What the fuck
were you thinking?

03:33.421 --> 03:34.756
- Chill, dude.
Okay?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.258
Will attacked us, remember?
We had to clap back.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.094
- You went too far, Connor.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.763
Look, this clapback could
get us expelled, or arrested.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.348
- You can't prove
I planted that shit.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.517
- Uh, my parents can,
and if they find...

03:47.811 --> 03:49.187
If they find out what you did,
they're gonna think

03:49.229 --> 03:50.939
I was in on it, too,
and then we're both fucked.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.315
- No one saw me, okay?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.025
Trust me, your parents--
they're not gonna find out.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.362
- Look, my dad has busted
five LAPD coverups.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.948
He's made Fortune 500 CEOs cry
under oath.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.616
And my mom will--

04:01.658 --> 04:04.369
She's a Black mom, and
you don't fuck with Black moms.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.787
Trust me.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.832
If anyone can find out,
it's my parents.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.335
- Shit, shit.
Okay, um, what are we gonna do?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.713
- Oh, "we"?

04:14.754 --> 04:17.048
"We" have to free Will.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.136
- Hey, um...

04:21.177 --> 04:23.972
[school bell rings]

04:24.014 --> 04:26.975
[quirky music]

04:27.017 --> 04:33.940
* *

04:35.358 --> 04:36.860
- This is in-school suspension.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.820
Schoolwork only.
No doodling.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.531
- This is art.
I don't doodle.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.370
- Swish.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.002
- Vivian and Philip, you've
both known me for a long time,

04:54.044 --> 04:55.420
and I can assure you

04:55.462 --> 04:58.340
that we've conducted
a thorough investigation.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.507
- Good.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.678
And because of
our longstanding relationship,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.680
I'm sure you won't mind
walking us through the process,

05:05.722 --> 05:07.849
step by step.
- Of course.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.102
After being debriefed
by campus security,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.271
we interviewed Will,
spoke to his teachers

05:13.313 --> 05:15.857
along with several classmates

05:15.899 --> 05:18.777
to gather insight
on his conduct.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.779
- And then?
- The faculty came

05:20.820 --> 05:24.199
to a consensus, and
our investigation was complete.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.868
- And what about the cameras?
I mean, I counted 15 of 'em

05:26.910 --> 05:28.953
just walking through
the front door.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.165
Security didn't see anyone
near his bag

05:32.207 --> 05:34.292
when they reviewed the tapes?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.502
- Um--

05:35.543 --> 05:37.420
- You have reviewed
the tapes, right?

05:39.673 --> 05:40.840
- Apparently not.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.883
- You didn't watch
the fucking tapes?

05:41.925 --> 05:42.884
- You didn't look
at the damn tapes?

05:42.926 --> 05:44.094
- Well, no.
- Legally,

05:44.135 --> 05:45.553
that boy is innocent
until proven guilty.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.847
- But we found drugs
in Will's bag.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.516
- But you didn't watch
the tapes.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.685
- We'd be looking for a needle
in a haystack.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.895
It could take us a week
to look over the footage.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.188
Maybe--
- I don't care.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.565
- You have 24 hours.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.777
We are not students.
Don't test us.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.237
- * I'm in my element *

06:02.278 --> 06:03.655
* I never fall back *

06:03.697 --> 06:04.781
* I'm in my element *

06:04.823 --> 06:05.907
* My haters... *

06:05.949 --> 06:07.951
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.122
- Will is returning to class.
Will.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.792
- Am I--
am I unsuspended?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.669
- Well, the investigation
is pending,

06:17.711 --> 06:20.422
but yes, at this moment,
you're no longer suspended.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.841
- The school is going to review
the campus security footage

06:22.882 --> 06:25.385
to see
who messed with your bag.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.137
- Damn.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.097
I mean, y'all really out here
still moving mountains for me.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.350
- And we're ready
to see you start climbing.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.393
Come on.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.603
* *

06:35.645 --> 06:37.647
- Oh, let me get my stuff.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.816
- * Yeah, yeah, man
came up strong *

06:39.858 --> 06:40.942
* Where the world I live
is like déjà vu *

06:40.984 --> 06:42.068
- Swish!

06:42.110 --> 06:43.445
- * I see it all the time *

06:43.486 --> 06:44.779
* *

06:44.821 --> 06:47.323
* Yeah, it's like déjà vu *

06:47.365 --> 06:48.658
* I see it all the time *

06:48.700 --> 06:50.660
* *

06:50.702 --> 06:52.954
* Yeah *

06:57.167 --> 07:00.253
- Congrats.
I heard you got unsuspended.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.921
- Pending the investigation.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.632
But once they roll the tape,
we'll see who did me dirty.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.301
- And by who,
you mean Connor?

07:06.343 --> 07:10.472
- Exactly, ol' Wonder Bread,
"Brady Bunch"-ass punk.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.265
- Well, don't count on justice.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.809
Kids like Connor
sidestep punishment every time.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.019
I'll never understand

07:16.061 --> 07:17.562
why Carlton is still friends
with him.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.980
- Oh, I do.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.357
- Come on.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.983
Just be happy you're
sitting pretty for the moment.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.693
- You think I'm pretty?
- I said sitting pretty, but--

07:23.735 --> 07:25.779
- Oh, all I heard was pretty.
- Oh, okay.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.073
- So I'ma take that W
and run with it.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.991
You think I'm pretty.
[both laugh]

07:30.033 --> 07:31.618
- Good luck at the game
tomorrow, Will.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.830
- Holy shit,
the thirst.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.916
- Ha! Don't be mad
'cause they feeling ya boy.

07:37.957 --> 07:38.875
- I'm not mad.
- Don't be mad!

07:38.917 --> 07:39.876
- And it's only because you're

07:39.918 --> 07:41.503
on the basketball team.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
- I wish
you were feeling me too.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.551
- Yeah, but we're
just friends, remember?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.887
- Yeah, I remember.
- [chuckles]

07:50.929 --> 07:52.764
- So, friend?
- Hmm?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.516
- You coming
to the basketball game?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.642
You know
we're playing Malibu Prep,

07:55.684 --> 07:57.143
so I'ma drop 30 on 'em.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.687
Come see me
in my Bel-Air jersey.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.271
It's my first game.
- Tempting,

08:00.313 --> 08:03.650
but I've got a swim meet,
so maybe I'll swing by after?

08:03.692 --> 08:04.693
- [nasally]
"Maybe I'll swing by after."

08:04.734 --> 08:06.111
- Boy, stop playing.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.699
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.783
- Are you really?
- I'm so sorry.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.411
- Are you really sorry?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.995
Come on, Lisa.
- Oh, my God.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.165
Ooh, it's getting worse.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.251
- All right.
Let me take this off.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.336
I can't go around school
looking like this.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.259
Hold on.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.263
Oh, yeah.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.514
[hip-hop music]

08:34.556 --> 08:36.224
- What are you doing?
- Just give it a chance.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.226
Just give it a chance.
Hold on. Hold on.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.519
- * Take my pride
and ambition *

08:39.561 --> 08:41.062
* Y'all should stop
and just listen *

08:41.104 --> 08:43.064
* Tell me
that I'm not winning *

08:43.106 --> 08:44.357
* I'm a man on my mission *

08:44.399 --> 08:46.026
- Actually, it's a whole vibe.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.986
- * Y'all just gotta believe *

08:48.028 --> 08:50.030
* Be yourself and that's key *

08:50.071 --> 08:51.239
- Sheesh.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.741
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I'm feeling it.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.872
- [sighs]

09:02.500 --> 09:05.628
- Hello.
Ooh, Mom!

09:05.670 --> 09:08.173
So Will told me
about you and Daddy

09:08.214 --> 09:11.343
rolling up to the school
on your power couple ish.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.511
Ugh, I wish I could have
seen Principal Hartwig's face.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.431
- Twenty shades of red
looking like cherry water ice.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.933
- What is water ice?
- Oh, it's just a Philly thing.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.561
Anyway, helping Will
was the right thing to do.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.812
- Right.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.397
[phone chimes]

09:26.107 --> 09:27.442
Oh, listen.
[phone chimes]

09:27.484 --> 09:29.778
I was wondering if we could
discuss tomorrow's menu.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.112
[ascending tone]
- Menu?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.155
[phone chimes]
What happened

09:32.197 --> 09:34.074
to the cupcakes
and champagne?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.492
- Yeah, I've been
rethinking that.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.951
- Ugh! Here we go.
- Okay.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.080
Nothing fancy, but
the ladies might get hungry,

09:40.121 --> 09:44.584
so I was thinking
maybe just some finger foods.

09:44.626 --> 09:48.963
Lamb sliders,
charcuterie...

09:49.005 --> 09:51.007
crab cakes
with your secret sauce.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.969
- I told you, my secret sauce
takes four hours to prepare,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.554
and I'd have to marinate it
overnight.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.348
- So is that a yes?
- Sure, Mom.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.183
I will help you
impress your sorors.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.644
- The ladies are helping me
plan Gayle's lupus fundraiser.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.104
The least I can do
is feed them.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.563
- Okay, yes.
That's fine.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.148
- And feel free
to hang out

10:07.190 --> 10:08.650
and kick it
with some of the ladies.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.943
I mean, you never know.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.570
It could lead
into another job opportunity.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.656
- And there's the agenda.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.991
- The "Haute Cuisine" job
didn't work out,

10:17.033 --> 10:19.244
but my other
Delta Phi Gamma sisters

10:19.285 --> 10:21.746
are all very accomplished
and very well-connected.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.665
- Okay. Okay, Mom.
- So you might want to--

10:23.707 --> 10:25.500
- Mom, you asked me
to make the food,

10:25.542 --> 10:30.630
I will make the food, but can I
have some me time, please?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.298
- [sighs]

10:32.340 --> 10:35.301
[pensive music]

10:35.343 --> 10:38.346
* *

10:38.388 --> 10:41.182
- Carlton.
- [sighs]

10:41.224 --> 10:43.059
Dude, why the hell
is your blazer inside out?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.020
- The principal just told me
that a witness came forward

10:45.061 --> 10:46.813
saying that he saw a guy
that doesn't even go

10:46.855 --> 10:48.273
to Bel-Air Academy
messing with my bag.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.567
- Holy shit.
That's awesome.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.193
- They're not gonna tell me
who the witness is,

10:52.235 --> 10:53.695
and because of him,
they're not gonna review

10:53.737 --> 10:54.863
the school footage.
- Look.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.114
You're a free man, Will.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.449
- I want you to admit
that you've been

10:57.490 --> 10:58.783
moving pieces around
in your little chess game.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.579
- There is no game, Will.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.833
Trust me.
Just take the win and move on.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.296
- Liar.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.720
[bright music]

11:18.762 --> 11:20.847
- * Where you at, yeah? *

11:20.889 --> 11:23.350
- Ha.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.352
- * Where you at? *
- * I don't see you *

11:25.393 --> 11:27.354
- Yeah, it felt good
to come through for Will today.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.189
Man, you should have seen
Viv take on the principal.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.231
Whoo.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.441
- Chopped him up real good,
yeah?

11:31.483 --> 11:32.400
- What?

11:32.442 --> 11:35.403
She Mongolian barbecued
his ass.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.613
- Well, it's good to see her
do it

11:36.654 --> 11:37.781
to somebody else
other than you.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
- Right?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.743
Yeah, well, now
that Will's in the clear,

11:41.785 --> 11:43.536
I only got 98
more problems to handle.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.372
- Campaign trouble?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.082
both: Ohh!

11:47.123 --> 11:49.167
- Here we go.
- Oh, damn it.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.796
My advisory team is saying
that the Black voters

11:52.837 --> 11:54.130
are feeling
disconnected from me.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.258
Can you believe that?
Philip Banks disconnected?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.761
- Might have something to do
with the coordinates

11:59.803 --> 12:01.137
of this mansion, you know,

12:01.179 --> 12:02.430
and the big boy interview
didn't help.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.516
- Well, your salary
doesn't exactly make you

12:04.557 --> 12:05.850
a man of the people.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.561
- All right, man, all right.
So what's the move?

12:08.603 --> 12:11.272
- Well, I decided to go to that
Alpha crawfish boil tomorrow.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.941
I need to win
over Reverend Lamonte

12:12.982 --> 12:14.859
and lock in his support,
and so,

12:14.901 --> 12:17.612
with my fraternity
brothers' support,

12:17.654 --> 12:19.531
the Black vote moves
safely into my column.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.116
- Sounds clever.
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.326
- I'd come with you, but man
just sailing to Catalina

12:23.368 --> 12:25.161
with that woman
from yoga, innit?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.542
- The woman from yoga?
- Yeah.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.128
- Yoga?
- [laughs]

12:33.169 --> 12:34.921
- Enjoy your day off, partner.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.299
Um, just give me a little
space, because this is...

12:40.135 --> 12:41.594
Boom.
- Oh!

12:41.636 --> 12:42.721
- Ha!
- All right, you know you stole

12:42.762 --> 12:43.847
that from me, yeah?

12:48.977 --> 12:53.023
- This one is for you.
- Thank you.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.607
It's been a while

12:54.649 --> 12:56.651
since you joined me
for my pre-meet tradition.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.487
- Yeah, well,
nostalgia is a hell of a drug,

12:59.529 --> 13:02.657
so I figured,
why not start again?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.409
- Okay.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.786
So what are we really
doing here, Carlton?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.164
- I wanted to apologize, Lis.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.749
I'm sorry you got caught up
in the bullshit

13:10.790 --> 13:12.667
between me and my cousin,

13:12.709 --> 13:16.212
and I know I haven't been
my best self lately.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.257
- That's an understatement.

13:19.299 --> 13:24.137
- I admit that I could have
handled things better,

13:24.179 --> 13:25.889
but just seeing you
and Will together

13:25.930 --> 13:28.308
just fucking destroyed me.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.435
I mean, I know we didn't end
on good terms,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.687
but I have feelings too,
and I wasn't gonna just--

13:32.729 --> 13:35.190
- Must I remind you I spent
the better part of last year

13:35.231 --> 13:37.359
putting your feelings
ahead of mine?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.069
- Oh, I didn't realize
I was such a burden.

13:39.110 --> 13:45.200
- I didn't say
you were a burden.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.536
You were there for me
at my worst when my mom died,

13:48.578 --> 13:51.289
and I was there for you while
you were dealing with anxiety.

13:51.331 --> 13:55.377
It's not like I just stopped
caring about you, Carlton.

13:55.418 --> 13:58.463
- So you're not just
saying that, right?

13:58.505 --> 14:01.925
- No.
I still care about you.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.011
[light upbeat music]

14:07.931 --> 14:09.557
[knock at door]

14:09.599 --> 14:12.894
- Come in.
- Hey, you got a minute?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.437
- Yeah.

14:14.479 --> 14:18.274
- I'm glad we cleared up
that situation at school today.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.902
Here.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.237
- "The Alchemist"?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.906
- It's a certified classic
right there.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.908
- Okay. What it's about?

14:26.950 --> 14:31.371
- It's about a boy who finds
the courage to follow his heart

14:31.413 --> 14:34.749
and the pursuit
of his personal legend.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.876
- Damn, sounds deep.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.712
- It's deep as hell.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.589
It's changed a lot of lives,

14:41.631 --> 14:44.050
including mine.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.011
Give it a read.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.930
- Okay, I'll do that.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.306
- You like crawfish?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.934
- Like, the little,
tiny lobster jawns?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.644
- Bingo.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.521
How would you like to come with
me to a crawfish boil tomorrow?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.273
My fraternity
is hosting the event.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.441
It's a crowd
that you should know,

14:59.482 --> 15:01.109
and it's really important
for my campaign.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.069
- Okay. I'm down.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.238
- That's what it looks like.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.282
- What you mean?
- You stepping up,

15:07.323 --> 15:11.036
giving this a real chance,
being a man of your word.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.287
That's what it looks like,
Will.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.460
- [chuckles]

15:18.501 --> 15:23.131
[phone chimes]

15:23.173 --> 15:26.134
[tense music]

15:26.176 --> 15:30.055
* *

15:30.096 --> 15:35.352
* *

15:40.482 --> 15:43.818
[birds chirping]

15:43.860 --> 15:45.945
- I thought you all were
leaving 20 minutes ago.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.947
- Dad got caught
on a campaign call.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.326
- Oh.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.328
- Did you leave any flowers
in the garden?

15:53.370 --> 15:55.955
- These are my sisters,
and I do not hold back,

15:55.997 --> 15:58.208
because I love them,
all of them,

15:58.249 --> 16:01.127
even the ones
that work my last nerve.

16:01.169 --> 16:04.047
I wished you'd show that same
kind of love to your cousin.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.508
- Well, look, it's kind of hard
to love a person

16:06.549 --> 16:09.511
that you don't know,

16:09.552 --> 16:11.513
especially if he doesn't
respect you.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.431
- Well, respect is
a two-way street.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.100
- Yeah, okay.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.812
- Listen, baby, I know
this hasn't been easy,

16:18.853 --> 16:20.438
but your father
and I wouldn't ask you

16:20.480 --> 16:23.983
to do anything we didn't think
you were capable of.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.987
We love you, and you will
always be our first priority.

16:31.449 --> 16:34.160
Now, I know you want
to impress Henry Miles today.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.912
- Oh, by the time
I'm done with him,

16:35.954 --> 16:37.956
he'll be practically begging me
to take that internship.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.083
- Okay, but all work
and no play --

16:40.125 --> 16:41.251
- Puts you head of the class
and helps you crush

16:41.292 --> 16:42.836
the competition?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.921
- Just try to have
a little fun.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.258
- Let's roll, son.
Will is waiting out front.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.260
- Wait, Will is going?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.345
The crawfish boil has always
been a me and you thing.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.347
- Well, yeah, but I thought
this time,

16:54.389 --> 16:55.682
we could all go together.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.934
It'll be fun.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.103
And you have fun
with your girls.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.063
Tell Joanne to stay
out of my good Scotch.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.065
We'll all be back in plenty
of time for the games tonight.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.860
- Right, it's Will's
basketball game against Malibu.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.028
- Should be exciting.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.362
- And my lacrosse game.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.947
- Right, you're playing
St. Stephens.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.615
We'll all be there
cheering you on.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.034
- I mean, at least half.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.453
We have to split it
between you and Will.

17:16.494 --> 17:19.372
- Fantastic.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.086
- Yeah, I know he's upset,
but I've arranged for the boys

17:25.128 --> 17:27.088
to volunteer side by side
at the event.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.842
- Oh, good, they'll either bond
or kill each other.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.094
- Well, either way,
problem solved, hmm?

17:33.136 --> 17:34.721
Love you.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.307
- * Relax yourself girl,
please settle down *

17:37.349 --> 17:39.601
* Relax yourself girl,
please settle down *

17:39.642 --> 17:42.312
* Relax yourself girl,
please settle down *

17:42.354 --> 17:44.064
* Relax yourself girl,
please settle down *

17:44.105 --> 17:46.566
- See it right there!
- Yeah!

17:46.608 --> 17:48.193
- * Relax yourself girl,
please settle down *

17:48.234 --> 17:49.527
- What up, you?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.571
- Yeah, that's how he do, man.

17:51.613 --> 17:54.532
Oh!

17:54.574 --> 17:56.493
- What's good, Yamacraw?

17:56.534 --> 17:58.787
- How are you, brother?
- Good, my brother.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.874
- Damn, it's good to be back
with my brothers.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.584
Hey, Will, you know
anything about the Alphas?

18:04.626 --> 18:05.835
- Yeah, we got mad Alphas
in Philly.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.128
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.506
- Yeah.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.216
- And there's the reverend.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.679
Come on, fellows,
let's go say hello.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.681
- So of course I agree
with my wife,

18:17.722 --> 18:20.308
because I know what time it is.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.018
- Pardon the interruption,
brothers.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.354
I just want to say a quick
hello to Reverend Lamonte.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.147
I was hoping
we might be able to talk.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.066
- I'm a little busy now, Phil.

18:28.108 --> 18:33.947
As I was saying, so--
- All right, then, maybe later.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.116
Good to see you all.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.201
- And then I end up sleeping
on the couch anyway.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.869
[laughter]

18:39.911 --> 18:42.580
- Hold up, is that Yamacraw?

18:42.622 --> 18:43.998
- Yo, who the hell is Yamacraw?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.334
- Dad.
It's his old nickname.

18:46.376 --> 18:50.380
That's where he's from,
Yamacraw, North Carolina,

18:52.966 --> 18:56.052
- Derrick, my guy.
How you been living?

18:56.094 --> 18:58.596
- Heart is still beating,

for much more these days.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.852
- I know that's right.
- It's been a while

19:03.893 --> 19:05.520
since you've shown
your face around here.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.939
There's some talk that Yamacraw
forgot about his brothers.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.607
- Not a chance.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.068
I've just been busy with family
and the campaign.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.945
You know I'd never forget
about the Alphas.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.198
- All right. All right.
Fair enough.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.783
I see you brought
a few volunteers.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.912
- I did. You remember Carlton?
- Hey.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.497
- And this here is my nephew.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.332
- What's up? What's up?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.501
- They're ready to work,
right, fellas?

19:28.543 --> 19:29.627
- Yeah, sure, of course.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.212
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
ready to work.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.256
- That's the Alpha spirit.
Follow me, fellas.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.091
We've got a few tables and
chairs that need to get set up.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.093
- All right.
Cool, let's do it.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.845
- Tables and chairs?
Why don't we grab a ladder

19:38.887 --> 19:41.514
and throw
a pro wrestling match?

19:41.556 --> 19:44.142
- Carlton.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.104
- So which one?
Tables or chairs?

19:48.146 --> 19:51.566

just both sound so exciting.

- Oh, Denise, Joan,

20:01.368 --> 20:04.537
I don't know how you got
season tickets to the Pantages

20:04.579 --> 20:08.875
for our silent auction,
but thank you, really.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.251
- Gayle was our sister, too,
Viv.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.628
We are more than happy to help.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.421
- And we are still working

20:13.463 --> 20:16.633

from the Montage too.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.552

come through.

20:19.594 --> 20:23.264
This year's lupus fundraiser
is already next level.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.059

needs help.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.729
We know you've got
a lot going on,

20:29.771 --> 20:32.565
and speaking of which, what is
your secret to doing it all?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.779
- Being Philip's
Michelle Obama.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.656
- Hey, there's
only one Michelle,

20:39.698 --> 20:43.201
but to be honest, this whole
being a politician's wife

20:43.243 --> 20:46.746
has been a big adjustment.

20:46.788 --> 20:50.500
Actually, I have been talking
to Michelle for advice.

20:50.542 --> 20:54.379
- And what did she say?
- She said, "Girl, hold on."

20:54.421 --> 20:56.589
- Now, you know, I remember
when all eyes

20:56.631 --> 21:00.385
were on Vivian Banks
taking the art world by storm,

21:00.427 --> 21:03.513
and Philip Banks
was the lucky guy on your arm.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.849
- Yeah, well, a lot changed
after Hilary was born.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.559
Oh, speaking of Hilary,

21:07.600 --> 21:10.687
ladies, I want to give a quick
shout-out to my daughter,

who prepared these delights.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.191
[all cheer]

21:15.233 --> 21:16.484
- Thank you, ladies.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.111
Really, though,
it's light work,

21:18.153 --> 21:19.654
but I appreciate it, though.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.657
- So if any of you ever
find yourself in need

21:22.699 --> 21:27.537
for a top-tier caterer,
please slide into her DMs.

21:27.579 --> 21:28.997

over there

21:44.304 --> 21:45.972

21:46.014 --> 21:48.058
- That was
Reverend Robert Lamonte.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.768
He leads
the largest Black church in LA.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.312
- Oh, Lamonte.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.397
So why was Pastor Petty
beefing with Uncle Phil?

21:54.439 --> 21:56.191
- He used to spend
a lot of time with the fam.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.318
I'm pretty sure he officiated
my parents' wedding,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.945
but that was years ago.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.572
You know, my guess is that Dad

22:02.614 --> 22:06.534
got a little too successful
for him.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.703
You know, wealth has a way
of attracting envy.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.915
- Hmm, or maybe the wealthy
lose touch.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.751
Nice sneak diss, though.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.670
- Holy shit.
That's him.

22:16.711 --> 22:20.090
He's actually here.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.132
- Oh, what, that old head
over there?

22:21.174 --> 22:23.134

22:23.176 --> 22:25.095
He owns a bunch
of funeral homes.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.639
Years ago, he cornered
the market on burying

22:27.681 --> 22:29.182
Black celebrities.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.101
- What, you trying to get
on his list or something?

22:31.142 --> 22:32.811
- No, I'm trying
to get on his radar.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.938
He's a major philanthropist,
and he sits on the board

22:34.979 --> 22:36.523
of the Black Minds First
Initiative,

22:36.564 --> 22:38.233
which would be
the perfect internship

to Princeton.

- Application?

Remember, you're rich.

about Berkeley--

- Last semester Hilary took
the whole year off

23:18.606 --> 23:22.152
to cultivate
her culinary skills.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.112
- Oh, like a gap year.

23:24.154 --> 23:28.658
- Well, no, I actually
dropped out of school.

Uh, yeah, so after
I graduated high school,

25:40.540 --> 25:43.084
the "Haute Cuisine" interview
up for her as a favor,

to drag our company online.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.216

posted after the interview?

and counting

Is that what you're telling me?

You want me to beg
and plead for forgiveness

27:26.354 --> 27:29.024

to build a life for my family?

he got the help that he needed.

I would have been there.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.923
you going to let him
talk to you like that?

28:34.964 --> 28:37.509
- Get Carlton.
We're leaving.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.104
- Okay, but look, I was
offered a high-profile job,

28:49.145 --> 28:50.647
and I turned it down

28:50.689 --> 28:52.565
because they were trying
to make me change my recipes.

28:52.607 --> 28:53.983
Some of the food
that I showed y'all

28:54.025 --> 28:55.402
was passed down
from my grandmother.

28:55.443 --> 28:58.947
Oh, and also, they told me
that my ethnic family

28:58.988 --> 29:00.448
was not their target audience,

29:00.490 --> 29:03.451
so "Haute Cuisine" probably
doesn't like your family

29:03.493 --> 29:05.036
either
if you're a person of color,

29:05.078 --> 29:06.871
so how about you let them know
what you think about that?

29:06.913 --> 29:08.373
[applause]

29:08.415 --> 29:10.208
- Good for you, Hilary.
- Yes.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.002
- I'm glad she called them out.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.546
- Well, I can see why Kendra
would never speak to me again.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.381
- Who cares about Kendra?

29:16.423 --> 29:20.343
She's lucky she got invited.
She did pledge grad chapter.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.095
- And why should I have
to apologize

29:22.137 --> 29:24.681
for speaking my truth?
- Amen.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.267
We have to call them out
on their bullshit.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.894
My CEO asked me to run point
with a Black client

29:29.936 --> 29:33.815
because we "speak
the same language."

29:33.857 --> 29:37.402
Like we're going to break
into Swahili or something.

29:37.444 --> 29:40.572
Worst part is, I let it slide.

29:40.613 --> 29:44.242
- There is something beautiful
about Hilary

29:44.284 --> 29:45.785
and her generation's refusal

29:45.827 --> 29:49.080
to swallow the subtle racism
that we have all ingested.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.708
- Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.

29:51.750 --> 29:52.834
- Okay, okay, but there's also

29:52.876 --> 29:57.339
such a thing as tact
and good judgment.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.969
Especially when someone asks
for a favor on your behalf

30:03.011 --> 30:04.929
and that someone
is your mother.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.556
- I didn't ask you to do that.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.892
You went to Kendra
because you just couldn't stand

30:08.933 --> 30:11.436
that my life was taking shape
not as fast as you want.

30:11.478 --> 30:15.148
- It's been two years, Hilary;
what do you got to show for it?

30:15.190 --> 30:16.483
What have you even figured out?

30:16.524 --> 30:18.651
- I've figured out that
you don't believe in me

30:18.693 --> 30:20.653
and that you want
to control my life.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.405
- Girl, if I was steering
the ship of your life,

30:22.447 --> 30:25.075
maybe you wouldn't be
so damn lost.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.209
- Look, let's just get down
to the brass tracks, Mr. Miles.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.878
- Hey, Carlton.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.963
[upbeat funky music]

30:39.005 --> 30:40.965
- Uh, do you need something,
Will?

30:41.007 --> 30:44.803
* *

30:44.844 --> 30:46.054
Are you having a stroke,

30:46.096 --> 30:49.307
or do you actually
need something, dude?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.059
- No, bro, do your thing.
Do your thing.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.560
Yo, Carlton is
a really good dude.

30:52.602 --> 30:57.148
Y'all would be lucky
to have him.

30:57.190 --> 30:59.317
- Anyway, I would love to talk

30:59.359 --> 31:01.361
about the Black Minds First
internship.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.406
- You know, I could talk
about that program all day.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.157
Go on.
Fire away, young man.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.784
- Awesome. Awesome.

31:07.826 --> 31:12.038
Well, look, this internship
would mean a lot to me

31:12.080 --> 31:13.540
personally,
and also, you know,

31:13.581 --> 31:15.959
it would really help bolster
my college application.

31:16.001 --> 31:19.838
I was wondering if you could
float my name to the top.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.341
- I would, but I resigned from
Black Minds First last month,

31:23.383 --> 31:27.512
and Derrick runs it now.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.014
You made a good impression
on him today, right?

what up, y'all?

31:37.939 --> 31:39.941
Can you hear me?
Is this on?

31:39.983 --> 31:41.693
Is this on?
- Yes.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.029
- Hey, what up y'all?
What up? What up?

31:44.070 --> 31:45.655
Ha! What up, man?
How y'all doing?

31:45.697 --> 31:47.532
How y'all doing?
My name is Will Smith.

31:47.574 --> 31:51.202
I was invited here
by my Uncle Phil.

31:51.244 --> 31:54.706
Some of y'all know him
as Yamacraw.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.541
Yamacraw, yeah, man.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.043
- Boy, get the hell
off the stage right now.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.377
- Phil, you better
get your nephew

31:59.419 --> 32:00.795
before we drag his skinny ass
out of here.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.213
- You going to drag
my skinny ass--

32:02.255 --> 32:03.173
you going to drag my skinny ass
out of here?

32:03.214 --> 32:04.382
- Phil.

32:04.424 --> 32:05.717
- Put the mic down,
and let's go.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.385
- Just chill.
Hey, my fault, yeah.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.762
I play too much. I'm joking.
I'm joking.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.388
- Will, that's enough. Come on.
Get off the stage.

32:10.430 --> 32:11.556
- All right. I'm sorry.
Matter of fact, come on,

32:11.598 --> 32:14.726
show me a little
somethin'-somethin'.

32:14.768 --> 32:17.228

32:17.270 --> 32:19.606
- Huh!
- Hey, not--Will, Will...

32:19.647 --> 32:20.857
come on.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.400
- I'm not doing it right?
- Come on. Come on.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.651
- Okay, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

32:23.693 --> 32:26.821
If I'm doing it wrong,
show me how it's done.

32:26.863 --> 32:28.740
Come on, Yamacraw.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.743
Show me what you got.

32:31.785 --> 32:35.914
- Let's see it, Yamacraw.

32:35.955 --> 32:39.125
- Yamacraw, Yamacraw,

Yamacraw...

All right.

Okay, I'll--I'll show you
how it's done, nephew.

33:01.815 --> 33:03.733
- All right, you got it.
- All right?

33:09.739 --> 33:15.912
I said, ooh,
it's cold in here.

33:15.954 --> 33:19.040
There must be some Alphas
in the atmosphere.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.208

Ooh, it's cold in here.

There must be some Alphas

we've been missing.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.982
Welcome back.

34:26.024 --> 34:30.236
- It's been in my heart,
Robert. It never left.

34:30.278 --> 34:35.408
Now, you think we can at least
have that conversation?

34:41.623 --> 34:43.583
- Now, look,
that nephew of yours...

34:43.625 --> 34:45.043
- Oh.
- Interesting.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.169
- Yeah.

What's the story?

Oh, so nice to just relax.

if you were going to notice it.

35:16.533 --> 35:18.743

35:18.785 --> 35:21.162
I also remember
when you finished this

let me sell it.

have seen Uncle Phil.

He was stepping like a king.
- Mm-hmm.

35:57.157 --> 36:00.243
- My man was stepping?
- Stepping, stepping.

Reverend Lamonte
agreed to support my campaign.

an endorsement?
