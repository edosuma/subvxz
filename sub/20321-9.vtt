I take it you were able to get
away without too much trouble.

00:21.834 --> 00:25.870
I've got a few hours
before anyone misses me. You?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.872
I'm not expected anywhere
until the morning.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.906
Well, then,

00:29.974 --> 00:33.343
I guess that means we have
all the time in the world.

00:53.564 --> 00:56.252
- OK, give me another one.
- 69 COPO Chevelle.

00:56.372 --> 01:00.335
OK, uh, Chevelle...
427 V8,

01:00.403 --> 01:02.404
- only 400 made in the world.
- That's pretty good.

01:02.471 --> 01:05.540
- OK.
- 68 L88.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.909
68 L88.

01:07.976 --> 01:10.111
170 mph, 550 horsepower?

01:10.179 --> 01:12.380
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, keep 'em coming.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.816
It's like you're cramming for an exam.
You're just meeting Sandy's father.

01:14.883 --> 01:17.017
I'm just meeting
Sandy's father...

01:17.085 --> 01:19.152
The man clearly doesn't
understand.

01:19.221 --> 01:21.689
- Help me understand, bro.
- OK,

01:21.756 --> 01:24.725
he started his own brickworks
company from scratch, all right?

01:24.792 --> 01:27.561
He has won the entrepreneurial award
the last five years in a row.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.831
He's a hard-driving, old school,
A-type personality

01:30.898 --> 01:33.833
if there ever was one, OK?
He's into muscle cars,

01:33.900 --> 01:37.069
and fishing,
and he's a crossbow enthusiast.

01:37.137 --> 01:39.872
That's a real thing. You think
that this is going to impress him?

01:39.940 --> 01:43.643
Well, you know, when Sandy got
divorced, he saw how hard

01:43.711 --> 01:46.512
it was on her, so now that
we're serious, he's gonna be

01:46.580 --> 01:49.348
taking a really tough look at me, and I'd
like to be able to pass the smell test.

01:49.415 --> 01:52.817
- Do you even own camouflage?
- OK, that's it.

01:52.885 --> 01:55.320
- What? What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up. Thank you.

01:55.388 --> 01:57.989
- I've never seen you clean up.
- Well, it's happening.

01:58.057 --> 02:00.024
Get used to it.
(Phone ringing)

02:02.385 --> 02:05.997
Logan.
I'll be right there.

02:06.065 --> 02:08.332
Anyway,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.335
I think you're gonna do great.

02:11.403 --> 02:13.337
Hey, can you grab
those newspapers on the...

02:13.405 --> 02:17.976
And he's gone. Sure. I'll get
that later. What am I thinking?

02:18.043 --> 02:20.044
Hey. IIB. Excuse me.

02:20.112 --> 02:22.679
- Hey.
- What have we got here?

02:22.747 --> 02:26.316
We have a white male, mid-30s, looks to
be dead about three, four hours tops.

02:26.384 --> 02:29.887
Looks like he bled out right here.
You think he put up a fight?

02:29.954 --> 02:32.578
- He was stabbed in the back.
- Any suspects?

02:32.698 --> 02:35.358
Not yet. But he only
checked in five hours ago

02:35.426 --> 02:38.127
and it looks like the bed has
been occupied.

02:38.195 --> 02:39.651
OK, so what are we doing here?

02:39.771 --> 02:42.731
Mr. Potter was a British
attaché to the Consul General.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.968
MI6 has asked us to personally
help in the investigation.

02:46.036 --> 02:48.871
So, our victim was a spy?

02:48.939 --> 02:50.973
Let's go.

♪

03:09.696 --> 03:12.112
Hey!
I'm just home to change,

03:12.232 --> 03:15.469
and then I have to run out
again. Another big case.

03:18.205 --> 03:20.840
Well, I'll probably be at work
when you get home,

03:20.908 --> 03:22.809
so I'll put
some dinner in the fridge.

03:22.877 --> 03:25.579
I know. Again.

03:27.548 --> 03:28.982
We'll talk when we talk.

03:29.049 --> 03:31.184
We'll see each other
when we see each other, OK?

03:31.252 --> 03:33.286
Thank you for being

03:33.353 --> 03:36.155
- so understanding about this.
- By this I assume you mean

03:36.222 --> 03:38.624
the thing we're
not talking about?

03:40.794 --> 03:43.195
I don't want
to pressure you, OK?

03:43.263 --> 03:46.059
I know having a baby is
a big decision.

03:46.179 --> 03:48.437
It is. But it's also not fair
to leave you hanging. You know,

03:48.557 --> 03:50.059
I'm just... I'm trying
to wrap my head around

03:50.179 --> 03:53.271
what it would mean to raise
a child and work in this job.

03:53.339 --> 03:56.040
You don't have to do that
alone. You know that, right?

03:56.108 --> 03:58.343
I know.

03:58.411 --> 04:00.578
You'd make a great dad.

04:00.646 --> 04:02.180
I know.

04:02.247 --> 04:05.683
I've been trying to tell you.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.519
Go save the world.
I will still be great

04:08.586 --> 04:10.621
when you get home.

04:21.464 --> 04:24.166
- What do we know?
- Well, our British diplomat,

04:24.234 --> 04:27.370
Jeremy Potter,
checked in to the hotel at 7 pm.

04:27.438 --> 04:29.972
And was killed at 10 pm.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.208
No forced entry
or defensive wounds,

04:32.275 --> 04:34.977
so he probably knew his
attacker. And forensics also

04:35.045 --> 04:37.178
confirmed that he had sex
not too long before he died.

04:37.246 --> 04:40.114
And Mr. Potter checked into
the hotel for one night only.

04:40.182 --> 04:42.050
Could it be a crime of passion?

04:42.117 --> 04:44.353
It's possible,
but the phone cord was cut

04:44.420 --> 04:45.721
and his cell phone is
still missing.

04:45.788 --> 04:47.656
Which is why he couldn't
call for help.

04:47.724 --> 04:49.277
- Right.
- Forensics seems to think

04:49.397 --> 04:51.926
that the killer was left-handed,
and the murder weapon was

04:51.994 --> 04:54.459
a 10-inch blade, so I'm thinking
maybe some type of hunting knife

04:54.579 --> 04:56.864
or something.
He was stabbed in the back

04:56.931 --> 04:59.299
- and bled out within minutes.
- So this is the work of someone

04:59.368 --> 05:00.986
- who knows what they're doing.
- Looks like it.

05:01.106 --> 05:03.016
I talked to the British
Consulate. They were

05:03.136 --> 05:06.240
tight-lipped, but my sources
tell me that he's on an MI6

05:06.307 --> 05:08.308
- watch list.
- Did they tell you why?

05:08.376 --> 05:10.443
He was somehow mixed up
in an investigation

05:10.511 --> 05:12.712
into an international
drug cartel.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.281
- Well, maybe the cartel took him out.
- The Brits want his cell back.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.023
Maybe there's something
relevant on that.

05:17.143 --> 05:19.919
Maybe. I've secured
a 24-hour news blackout

05:19.987 --> 05:22.288
on the story
until we find out more.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.990
MI6 are keeping a lid
on the British media.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.427
But we need to find out
what Jeremy Potter was into.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.379
(Sobbing)

05:37.499 --> 05:39.971
Mrs. Potter, we're gonna do
everything that we can

05:40.039 --> 05:41.972
to find who killed
your husband.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.008
Thank you.

05:44.075 --> 05:47.111
He was a good man.
This has been a terrible shock.

05:47.178 --> 05:50.781
We just need to ask you
a couple of questions, OK?

05:50.848 --> 05:52.816
Of course.

05:52.884 --> 05:57.154
Did you notice anything unusual in
your husband's behaviour lately?

05:57.222 --> 06:00.324
He seemed a little distant.

06:00.392 --> 06:02.459
He's been busy.

06:02.527 --> 06:05.128
And, honestly, I suppose

06:05.195 --> 06:07.696
I've been occupied
with our son, Jordan.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.933
Did your husband ever talk
about his work?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.936
Did you ever notice
anyone following him

06:13.003 --> 06:16.272
or any unusual phone calls?

06:16.340 --> 06:18.574
No, I'll meet you there.

06:18.642 --> 06:21.143
I have your information
from the agency.

06:23.413 --> 06:25.814
I don't know.

06:25.881 --> 06:27.760
There are always
sensitive issues

06:27.880 --> 06:30.819
that a diplomat must not share
with his wife.

06:30.886 --> 06:33.121
All right. Do you feel that
there might have been something

06:33.189 --> 06:34.856
he was holding back from you?

06:34.924 --> 06:38.292
He was secretive.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.328
He needed to be for his job.

06:40.395 --> 06:42.330
But he was getting tired of it.

06:42.397 --> 06:45.099
We were discussing
making a change.

06:45.167 --> 06:46.948
Was he thinking
of leaving the service?

06:47.068 --> 06:49.850
Yes. Jeremy was
a brilliant man.

06:49.970 --> 06:54.374
He could have done well
at any career that he chose.

06:54.442 --> 06:58.744
I'm sorry,
but we do have to ask you...

06:58.812 --> 07:00.880
Where you were last night?

07:00.948 --> 07:03.249
Oh.

07:03.317 --> 07:05.485
Of course.

07:05.552 --> 07:07.712
I was here at home

07:07.832 --> 07:10.889
with my child.

07:10.957 --> 07:13.418
We'll confirm that she was home last
night, but I don't think she's a suspect.

07:13.538 --> 07:15.689
I read her listening in
on a phone call with Jeremy.

07:15.809 --> 07:19.631
He was making arrangements for a
meeting set up by "The Agency".

07:19.699 --> 07:22.234
- Could be the CIA.
- Maybe he was playing some game

07:22.302 --> 07:24.269
with the Americans and
his own people took him out.

07:24.337 --> 07:27.605
Anything's possible in the spy game.
Especially if he was a liability.

07:27.672 --> 07:29.771
I have Jeremy's travel
itinerary from the consulate.

07:29.891 --> 07:32.447
He made frequent trips
to Hong Kong over the last year.

07:32.567 --> 07:35.009
OK, well, that's a popular spot
for offshore accounts, right?

07:35.129 --> 07:37.648
A young father doesn't
jump ship without a life vest.

07:37.716 --> 07:40.272
Maybe the cartel's financing
his retirement plan.

07:40.392 --> 07:42.185
He was going to Hong Kong
to make deposits.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.221
I'll look deeper
into his financials and see

07:44.288 --> 07:46.789
if I can track large deposits
or upgrades to his lifestyle.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.893
OK, we'll head to the British Consulate
and see if we can pry any information.

07:54.598 --> 07:57.334
I thought these magazines were supposed to
be full of pictures of women in bikinis.

07:57.402 --> 08:01.037
This is just car, car, car..
Hey!

08:01.104 --> 08:03.406
Now we're talking. Huh?

08:03.473 --> 08:05.909
Do you think her parents are
proud of her?

08:08.245 --> 08:11.614
Uh, not really appropriate
for during work hours.

08:11.682 --> 08:13.382
You can get back to the job.
Thanks.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.617
Thanks.
Enjoy your magazine.

08:15.685 --> 08:17.619
Hi!
Daddy, this is Oz.

08:17.687 --> 08:19.988
It's very nice
to meet you, sir.

08:20.056 --> 08:23.025
That's quite the grip
you've got there.

08:25.995 --> 08:29.497
- Nice suit.
- Oh, thank you! Thanks.

08:29.565 --> 08:31.488
I thought you were a nurse
or something.

08:31.608 --> 08:35.102
No, I'm actually the head of
Emergency Services. Not that nurses

08:35.169 --> 08:38.697
like our Sandy here aren't
an invaluable part of the team.

08:38.817 --> 08:40.741
Not that she's "our" Sandy,

08:40.808 --> 08:43.644
"our" Sandy, like...
Ha! Ha! How was lunch?

08:43.712 --> 08:47.480
- I took him to our favourite place.
- Pho Hung? Did you just die?

08:47.548 --> 08:52.118
- Those noodles just melt in your mouth.
- It's soup.

08:52.186 --> 08:55.288
Yeah.

08:55.355 --> 08:58.501
Uh, speaking of soup,
you know...

08:58.621 --> 08:59.537
my friend is in the process

08:59.657 --> 09:02.896
- of souping up his Pontiac 455.
- Really?

09:03.016 --> 09:04.697
- Yeah.
- Seventy?

09:04.764 --> 09:06.632
Yeah, that's
the classic year, right?

09:06.700 --> 09:08.005
- Super Duty?
- You bet.

09:08.125 --> 09:13.472
- Super Duty didn't come out 'til 73.
- Ah. My mistake.

09:13.539 --> 09:15.655
But like the Super Duty,
this baby also has

09:15.775 --> 09:19.511
round pored cylinder heads and cast
iron exhaust header manifolds, so...

09:19.579 --> 09:22.494
Probably the finest American
engine offered that year.

09:22.614 --> 09:25.703
Wow. You really know
your stuff.

09:25.823 --> 09:28.492
Oh, I dabble.

09:28.612 --> 09:31.423
- I should get back to work.
- OK, well, it was very nice

09:31.491 --> 09:33.007
- to meet you, Mr. Wardwell.
- You too.

09:33.127 --> 09:35.910
- I hope to do it again. OK!
- You can let go.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.735
OK. Yeah.

09:44.802 --> 09:47.037
<i>Thank you for meeting
with us, Ms. Parkhurst.</i>

09:47.105 --> 09:49.473
As you know,
MI6 has asked for our help

09:49.541 --> 09:51.707
in finding whoever killed
Jeremy Potter.

09:51.775 --> 09:54.977
I'll help however I can.
But you'll have to understand

09:55.045 --> 09:58.648
that I cannot share certain pieces of
sensitive or confidential information.

09:58.715 --> 10:01.050
- Of course.
- Is it true that MI6 was looking into him?

10:01.118 --> 10:03.386
If you'd like to know
about MI6's activities,

10:03.454 --> 10:06.622
- I suggest you ask MI6.
- What about his trips

10:06.689 --> 10:09.191
to Hong Kong? Were those
sanctioned by the consulate?

10:09.259 --> 10:11.993
They have been investigated.

10:12.061 --> 10:14.709
There has been no proof
of malfeasance on Jeremy's part.

10:14.829 --> 10:17.266
Was Jeremy acting suspicious?

10:26.241 --> 10:28.476
I think you've been watching
too many spy films.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.494
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm due at a meeting.

10:31.614 --> 10:34.983
Well, if you think of anything
that could help us, please call.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.122
She's lying.
She has a file on him.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.259
Anything on Potter's
financials?

10:46.379 --> 10:50.345
No big deposits, no diamonds
or luxury cars purchased.

10:50.465 --> 10:54.474
But the hotel sent over some video
from the night Jeremy was killed.

10:54.594 --> 10:57.304
That's him getting out
of the elevator with a woman.

10:57.371 --> 11:00.073
- Could this be our killer?
- They got off on the same floor,

11:00.140 --> 11:02.742
and this was about an hour and a
half before Jeremy's time of death.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.545
The doorman flagged her a cab.
The cab company just sent me

11:05.613 --> 11:08.248
an address where she was
dropped off on the west side.

11:08.316 --> 11:11.153
Relay it to Toby and Michelle.
Have them pick her up.

11:11.273 --> 11:15.221
Oh! And tell them to be careful.
She could be a trained killer.

11:30.736 --> 11:33.338
I see movement.

11:33.405 --> 11:35.406
IIB! Open up!

11:38.510 --> 11:41.713
- Can I help you?
- Jessica Traynor?

11:46.050 --> 11:48.518
I think we're gonna need
reinforcements.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.218
Rob, there's a sippy cup
in the fridge.

11:55.338 --> 11:58.763
- I know, Jess, I know.
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

11:58.883 --> 12:00.823
We just need to ask you
a couple of questions,

12:00.890 --> 12:03.392
but maybe you'd prefer to go
somewhere a little bit more private?

12:03.460 --> 12:06.668
I've got my hands full.
You can ask me anything here.

12:06.788 --> 12:08.362
Can you identify this man?

12:10.332 --> 12:14.005
Why are you asking me?

12:14.125 --> 12:17.135
- If you could just answer the question.
- What's going on here, Jess?

12:17.255 --> 12:20.443
They just want to know if
I know this man... and I don't.

12:20.563 --> 12:22.776
You sure?

12:22.896 --> 12:26.312
- You're sure that no one knows?
- You don't trust the agency?

12:26.380 --> 12:29.249
(Laughing)
I've never met this man before.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.785
(Baby crying) You need to tell me
what's going on here, Jessica.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.255
- I don't know!
- His name is Jeremy Potter.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.990
He was found murdered
in his hotel room last night.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.026
What does that have to do
with my wife?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.632
I met with him last night.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.068
You were the last one
to see him alive.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.037
Can we discuss this
somewhere else?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.939
Yeah, why don't you
come back to our office?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.142
Rob, just take Russell
upstairs.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.646
It's time for his nap.
Call a lawyer.

12:58.766 --> 13:02.947
(Baby crying)

13:03.015 --> 13:04.949
So, how long did you know
Mr. Potter?

13:05.017 --> 13:07.018
I didn't know him.
Not really.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.020
So you just met him last night?

13:09.088 --> 13:12.257
It sounds horrible
when you put it like that.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.758
We met through the agency.

13:14.826 --> 13:18.696
- Which agency?
- Samantha Matheson.

13:18.763 --> 13:23.543
The website for cheating spouses. They make
cheating look as wholesome as apple pie.

13:23.663 --> 13:25.311
Have you used
the website before?

13:25.431 --> 13:27.717
No. It was my first time.

13:29.177 --> 13:31.505
I'm not that kind of person.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.847
So, what happened
after you two had sex?

13:36.247 --> 13:38.381
Thank you.

13:38.449 --> 13:40.717
I took a shower and then I left.

13:40.784 --> 13:43.587
- What time was that?
- Sometime after eight.

13:43.654 --> 13:46.088
Did you see anyone suspicious
in the hallway?

13:46.155 --> 13:49.412
- No.
- Jeremy say he was in danger?

13:50.628 --> 13:53.531
We didn't talk
about our personal lives.

13:56.633 --> 14:00.001
I really wish I hadn't gotten
involved in this.

14:02.238 --> 14:06.465
The Samantha Matheson Agency. It's an
anonymous hookup site for married people.

14:06.585 --> 14:09.125
Didn't that used to be called
an airport bar?

14:09.245 --> 14:12.421
Jeremy Potter was a member
for about a year.

14:12.541 --> 14:13.781
- I checked his records.
- I'm guessing

14:13.849 --> 14:16.050
the company doesn't bill their
clients as Samantha Matheson.

14:16.118 --> 14:18.752
That would be funny explaining that
one to the spouse, wouldn't it?

14:18.872 --> 14:20.587
Exactly.
It actually comes up on the bill

14:20.655 --> 14:23.997
as "The Cookbook Club".
The company sells itself

14:24.117 --> 14:27.273
on privacy. It's got
a 100%-secrecy guarantee.

14:27.393 --> 14:30.064
- What does that mean, exactly?
- Well...

14:33.034 --> 14:36.558
It means that this website is
very difficult to hack,

14:36.678 --> 14:38.179
even for a Jedi master.

14:38.299 --> 14:40.067
So, why don't you
join the site?

14:40.187 --> 14:43.409
I... Yeah.
I could take the easy way out

14:43.477 --> 14:47.302
and make a profile, poke around, and see
what the site's all about, I guess.

14:47.422 --> 14:49.167
Just make sure it stays
as research.

14:49.287 --> 14:51.750
What about our suspect,
Mrs. Traynor?

14:51.818 --> 14:53.819
My reads pointed
to a lonely housewife.

14:53.887 --> 14:57.196
If she's a spy, that's one hell
of a cover story.

14:57.316 --> 14:59.613
She is left-handed.
There's still a lot

14:59.733 --> 15:01.193
we don't know about her
or our victim,

15:01.261 --> 15:05.097
but they do have one thing
in common: the website.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.198
- Pay them a visit.
- All right.

15:07.266 --> 15:10.034
Let's go.

15:23.747 --> 15:26.382
Beautiful. Beautiful.
That's great!

15:26.450 --> 15:29.138
- Tanya Wilkes?
- Yes. Can I help you?

15:29.258 --> 15:32.041
IIB. Can we chat
for a minute?

15:32.161 --> 15:34.524
- I'm kind of busy right now.
- This won't take long.

15:34.591 --> 15:38.760
Keep going.
It's OK.

15:38.829 --> 15:40.696
Yes, what can I do for you?

15:40.763 --> 15:43.232
Adultery seems to be
a booming business.

15:43.300 --> 15:47.684
I take it you don't approve of the
service I provide. That's fine.

15:47.804 --> 15:50.577
Is your company based
on personal experience?

15:52.075 --> 15:55.276
I'm happily married.
Never felt the urge to stray.

15:55.344 --> 15:58.579
But some married people are
desperate for excitement.

15:58.647 --> 16:01.515
There's a market for it.
I saw a way to monetize that.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.574
- How does this work?
- Well, our clients register

16:04.694 --> 16:07.406
on the site. They create
a profile. They browse.

16:07.526 --> 16:10.557
And if they want to make contact,
there is a fee for private messages.

16:10.624 --> 16:13.861
- And what is it that you provide exactly?
- A safe place to play.

16:13.928 --> 16:16.930
Everything our clients do
on our site is completely secure

16:17.050 --> 16:19.686
and secret.
What's this about?

16:19.806 --> 16:23.221
Jeremy Potter was found murdered
in his hotel room last night

16:23.341 --> 16:26.708
after hooking up with Jessica
Traynor. Both clients of yours.

16:26.828 --> 16:30.244
That's... shocking news.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.049
But I'm not sure there's
anything I can do to help you.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.050
- Why not?
- Well, I'm known

16:35.170 --> 16:37.992
for providing maximum secrecy
and privacy to my clients.

16:38.112 --> 16:39.886
This is a homicide
investigation. If you don't

16:39.953 --> 16:42.922
share whatever information
you have, we will

16:43.042 --> 16:46.087
shut down your website.
You understand that, right?

16:46.207 --> 16:47.760
Of course.

16:47.827 --> 16:50.829
Is there anything
you're not telling us?

16:50.897 --> 16:53.999
Woman: <i>Name's
Don Hutchison...</i>

16:54.066 --> 16:56.635
Cookbook Club cancellations
can only be made by members.

16:56.703 --> 17:01.218
Woman: <i>He can't! My husband
is dead! He was murdered!</i>

17:01.338 --> 17:04.346
If there's anything relevant
I can think of,

17:04.465 --> 17:05.835
I will definitely
share it with you.

17:05.954 --> 17:07.358
If you do, you give us a call.

17:07.479 --> 17:10.848
- Of course.
- Thank you.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.202
All right, how's it look?

17:14.819 --> 17:17.029
This is Don Hutchison:

17:17.148 --> 17:19.170
43, married, father of two.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.781
He was found dead in the Rainbow
Motel 10 nights ago.

17:21.901 --> 17:25.608
He was stabbed to death, and the phone
cord was cut. Same MO as our killer.

17:25.728 --> 17:28.415
- I'll let Metro know we're gonna take over.
- Good.

17:28.536 --> 17:30.801
Let's find out what
our victims have in common...

17:30.868 --> 17:34.448
foreign connections, ties
with the intelligence community.

17:34.568 --> 17:38.474
They both have glasses. Same hair,
same eyes, same facial features.

17:38.542 --> 17:42.478
You think someone's using the
website to profile their target?

17:42.546 --> 17:46.171
- More like a hunting ground.
- Two deaths in 10 days.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.231
If we don't get this guy soon,
there's going to be a third.

17:48.351 --> 17:51.091
We might be looking
at a serial killer.

18:00.018 --> 18:01.591
I just talked to my contacts.

18:01.711 --> 18:05.046
Jessica Traynor has absolutely no
ties to the intelligence community.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.446
That's the same as our second
victim, Don Hutchison.

18:07.566 --> 18:09.571
He's not a spy.
He's an investment banker.

18:09.691 --> 18:11.979
Well, we spoke
to Mr. and Mrs. Traynor.

18:12.046 --> 18:14.046
I see couples therapy
in their future.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.365
- Did you get anything from them?
- An alibi for the night

18:16.485 --> 18:19.140
of the murder. He says that
they were watching TV all night.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.821
- He could be covering for her.
- Nah, he was pretty angry

18:21.889 --> 18:25.992
with her. I don't see him lying. Jessica
swears she never met Don Hutchison.

18:26.059 --> 18:28.951
OK, so, let's assume for a minute
that Jessica's telling the truth.

18:29.071 --> 18:33.166
There has to be someone or something
that connects these two victims.

18:33.234 --> 18:36.068
- What else do we know about them?
- Well, I did some digging

18:36.136 --> 18:38.070
and these guys have totally
different careers.

18:38.138 --> 18:40.439
They live on opposite sides of
town. There seems to be nothing

18:40.507 --> 18:44.243
connecting them other than their physical
similarities and their affinity for cookbooks.

18:44.311 --> 18:48.193
All right, so the only real connection,
then, is this damn website.

18:48.313 --> 18:51.082
Might want to shake that tree
until it bears some fruit.

18:51.150 --> 18:54.752
Mrs. Wilkes.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.987
You again.

18:57.055 --> 19:00.124
Who's that?
Don Hutchison.

19:00.191 --> 19:02.427
Somebody is using your website
as a hunting ground.

19:02.494 --> 19:05.396
The bodies are starting to pile up.
There's been another murder?

19:05.464 --> 19:07.364
And you're going to help us
before it happens again.

19:07.433 --> 19:09.634
I told you before.

19:09.701 --> 19:12.686
My business is built upon
absolute and total privacy

19:12.806 --> 19:13.937
among consenting adults.

19:14.004 --> 19:16.840
Every member signs a detailed
disclaimer absolving us

19:16.908 --> 19:19.208
- of any responsibility.
- So we'll get a warrant.

19:19.276 --> 19:22.579
I have a top Bay Street firm on retainer.
They'll tie up your warrant until doomsday.

19:22.647 --> 19:25.494
You lied to us. You knew
about Don Hutchison's murder

19:25.614 --> 19:27.683
- but you kept it from us.
- Thousands of people use

19:27.751 --> 19:31.787
my site every single day. How could
I possibly know it was connected?

19:31.855 --> 19:34.356
Word will spread like wildfire.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.726
You know, we're gonna have
to have that press conference,

19:37.794 --> 19:40.162
let the world know there's a killer
out there stalking your clients,

19:40.229 --> 19:43.832
that the Samantha Matheson Agency
is a dangerous place to play.

19:43.899 --> 19:45.733
You can't do that.

19:45.801 --> 19:48.670
Yeah, we can, and we will.
And while we are at it,

19:48.737 --> 19:51.506
we'll bring you up on charges
of obstruction.

19:54.677 --> 19:57.011
Fine.

19:57.079 --> 19:59.080
What do you want?

19:59.147 --> 20:02.248
Names, addresses,
personal details. Everything.

20:02.316 --> 20:05.185
Well, you can have the client
data, but the conversation

20:05.252 --> 20:07.788
and hookup data scrubs itself
clean every 24 hours.

20:07.856 --> 20:10.457
It uses proprietary software.
It cost me a fortune.

20:10.525 --> 20:13.426
I couldn't even begin
to tell you how it works.

20:13.495 --> 20:16.261
So you find us someone who can.

20:16.329 --> 20:19.298
Hey, Mr. Boone.
Thanks for coming in.

20:19.366 --> 20:21.433
- Yeah.
- Get you a glass of water?

20:21.502 --> 20:24.393
No, I'm fine. Listen,
this won't take long,

20:24.513 --> 20:25.738
will it?
I gotta get back to my office.

20:25.806 --> 20:27.874
We'll have you out of here
in just a minute.

20:27.941 --> 20:30.877
I gotta tell you,

20:30.944 --> 20:34.980
the security system you built,
it stonewalled even me.

20:35.047 --> 20:37.115
Well, then it's doing what
it's supposed to, isn't it?

20:37.182 --> 20:40.752
We want to know: can someone log in and
access the other members' messages?

20:40.820 --> 20:43.588
No. No, that's impossible.

20:43.656 --> 20:47.025
It's a seven-pass low-level
deleted every 24 hours.

20:47.092 --> 20:49.827
DND-quality security.
One of my clients, by the way.

20:49.895 --> 20:52.329
What about if it was still
in the database?

20:52.397 --> 20:55.065
Could an administrator monitor
and duplicate it offline?

20:55.133 --> 20:57.401
(Boone): <i>Code monkeys...</i>
<i>backdoor.</i>

20:57.468 --> 21:00.137
We know you subcontracted out
some of the work.

21:00.204 --> 21:04.707
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is all my software.

21:04.775 --> 21:09.012
If you parcelled out your work, that
would be a huge security breach.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.915
I need all four subroutines
by tomorrow. Ten bucks an hour.

21:11.982 --> 21:14.684
Do it fast. Doesn't have
to be pretty, OK?

21:16.820 --> 21:20.822
Look, we know that you're using outside
coders to do your work for you.

21:20.890 --> 21:24.393
Now, if you did the same thing with,
say, the Department of National Defence,

21:24.461 --> 21:27.629
that would be
an indictable offence.

21:27.697 --> 21:30.666
Could I get
that glass of water now?

21:30.733 --> 21:33.035
Yeah, could we get the names
of the coders?

21:37.039 --> 21:40.942
- We got lots of water here for you.
- Thanks.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.138
Dad, you really didn't need
to pick me up from work.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.963
I walk home alone every day.

21:45.083 --> 21:48.708
- Oh, you know. Town's full of creeps.
- You're back! That's great.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.651
I got some great news
for you, sir.

21:50.719 --> 21:52.185
- Call me Bill.
- Oh!

21:52.305 --> 21:55.794
OK. Bill. Well, I got three
words: Classic Car Pageant.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.991
Opening night of the auto show,
two tickets.

21:58.059 --> 22:00.494
- This is tomorrow night, right?
- Yeah, you heard about it?

22:00.562 --> 22:03.597
Yeah, I was hoping to
take it in before I left town.

22:03.664 --> 22:06.121
- Well, then, you and I are on!
- Yeah?

22:06.241 --> 22:07.055
Yeah.

22:07.175 --> 22:10.203
We were supposed
to go to Tara's play.

22:10.270 --> 22:13.439
It's opening night.
Her first lead role.

22:13.507 --> 22:17.042
Yeah, but it's a play, you know? I'd
rather go at the end of the run.

22:17.111 --> 22:18.679
Let them work out
all the kinks.

22:18.799 --> 22:22.881
Plus, your dad seems pretty excited
about the Classic Car Pageant.

22:22.949 --> 22:25.484
Yeah, of course.
Go. You boys have fun,

22:25.551 --> 22:28.653
OK? Old cars. Yay!

22:28.721 --> 22:31.112
- So, what do you say, Bill? Are you in?
- Sure.

22:31.232 --> 22:34.559
All right! Tomorrow night it is. I will
see you there. Pedal to the metal.

22:34.627 --> 22:37.596
I'm gonna bring
the car around, sweetie.

22:37.663 --> 22:40.264
OK, I'll be out there in five!

22:40.332 --> 22:44.998
'Cause you're talking
to her... call me sweetie...

22:45.118 --> 22:48.071
Hey, is it just me, or is he
not that excited about this?

22:48.140 --> 22:50.741
- That's just him. Mr. Gruff.
- I'm sorry about the play.

22:50.808 --> 22:53.321
I totally spaced out on it. I
promise you we'll go another night.

22:53.441 --> 22:57.247
It's fine. If my dad likes you,
missing opening night's fine.

22:57.314 --> 22:58.883
- You're sure?
- Of course! It's fine.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.851
- Look, fine!
- OK. You're the best.

23:01.918 --> 23:04.854
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

23:04.921 --> 23:07.490
Metro did another sweep of
the first victim's hotel room.

23:07.558 --> 23:10.460
They didn't turn up anything. Not surprising.
It was 10 days ago.

23:10.528 --> 23:12.694
So, Boone didn't make
the software himself,

23:12.762 --> 23:15.230
so it looks like we have
12 more coders to look into.

23:15.298 --> 23:17.766
"Interests: opera, fine wine,

23:17.833 --> 23:21.203
"gourmet dining. I'll take you on a romantic
ride around town before sweeping you

23:21.271 --> 23:23.205
off to my bedroom."
I like this.

23:23.273 --> 23:25.907
- Is that me?
- Well, it's you.

23:25.975 --> 23:28.909
But it's a fantasy you.
Klein 2.0, if you will.

23:28.977 --> 23:32.647
It's a fake profile that I made
so I could lurk around the site.

23:32.714 --> 23:35.349
- Is that my vacation photo?
- I think it's a good shot...

23:35.417 --> 23:38.852
I'll take it down.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.390
I'll take it down now.
OK, guys,

23:42.457 --> 23:45.325
so, using what Boone just gave
us, I can monitor traffic,

23:45.393 --> 23:48.628
but he was right. The messages
are encrypted with 256-bit keys,

23:48.696 --> 23:50.797
so I can see the open chats,
but that's about it.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.032
Is there anything
on the coders that he used?

23:53.100 --> 23:54.730
- Give me a second.
- OK, but if he had

23:54.850 --> 23:57.941
outside people working on the site,
one of them could be eavesdropping.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.773
Are you saying that someone could
be periodically cloning the drives

24:01.841 --> 24:03.809
and if they created the security
algorithm themselves...

24:03.876 --> 24:06.266
Then they could break into it
whenever they wanted to.

24:06.386 --> 24:07.038
Yeah.

24:07.158 --> 24:09.682
Guys, hold up.
There's someone else in here.

24:09.749 --> 24:13.018
Administrative access, but it's
not us and it's not the agency.

24:13.086 --> 24:15.120
- Can you track them?
- They got a lot of proxies,

24:15.188 --> 24:17.455
but I can trace it through...

24:17.523 --> 24:19.490
Istanbul... Sydney...

24:19.558 --> 24:21.492
Portland... Seattle...

24:21.560 --> 24:24.795
Toronto...

24:24.863 --> 24:26.598
- All right, I got an IP.
- Can they see you?

24:26.665 --> 24:28.766
No, I'm a digital ninja.

24:28.834 --> 24:32.002
It's registered to an apartment
complex in Rexdale.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.671
A Tom Walton. That's one of
the guys that Boone gave us.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.006
He's a 19-year-old computer
engineering student at York.

24:37.074 --> 24:39.409
Let's go pick him up.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.313
Purely out of curiosity,

24:43.381 --> 24:46.182
how many hits
did that profile get?

24:46.251 --> 24:48.984
Uh... you wanna see?

24:49.052 --> 24:50.953
No.

25:01.531 --> 25:04.266
Still nothing.

25:09.104 --> 25:12.674
I bet you 20 bucks
I know what you're thinking.

25:12.742 --> 25:15.343
I didn't read your mind.

25:15.411 --> 25:17.512
OK.
What am I thinking?

25:17.580 --> 25:20.814
You're thinking these guys got what they
deserved because they cheated on their wives.

25:20.882 --> 25:22.916
Wow. You really...
You think I'm that judgmental?

25:22.984 --> 25:26.754
No. I just... I know you. You have a
strong feeling about these things.

25:26.821 --> 25:28.889
I don't get
all of the sneaking around.

25:28.956 --> 25:31.292
The kids at home.
All of the lying.

25:31.359 --> 25:33.372
People lie.
It's what we do.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.062
- I lied to Tia constantly.
- You didn't cheat on her.

25:36.130 --> 25:39.565
No. But, you know,
I looked her in the eyes

25:39.633 --> 25:44.170
and I would lie about my thing,
about what I do with the IIB.

25:44.237 --> 25:46.673
I couldn't take it anymore.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.974
- You told her?
- Yeah, I had to.

25:49.042 --> 25:51.444
I figured it'd only
be worse if I didn't.

25:51.512 --> 25:53.512
I think that the only thing
you can control

25:53.579 --> 25:56.481
in a relationship
is your own honesty.

25:56.549 --> 25:59.184
You gotta hope that the other
person does the same.

25:59.251 --> 26:02.521
Didn't work out so well
for you, did it?

26:04.490 --> 26:06.725
Michelle. Look.

26:06.793 --> 26:09.427
Check this out.

26:09.494 --> 26:11.395
That's him.

26:11.463 --> 26:15.966
Tom Walton? IIB.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.602
What is this about?
Tom, what is this about?

26:21.506 --> 26:24.274
<i>Gotta scrub the drive.</i>

26:26.577 --> 26:29.146
- He's going to erase his hard drive!
- Go around!

26:39.958 --> 26:41.991
Get off me!
Ow, ow, that hurts!

26:53.637 --> 26:56.391
I already told you
I didn't do anything wrong.

26:56.459 --> 26:59.293
- So why did you run?
- Where I'm from, cops get in your face,

26:59.361 --> 27:01.429
- it's not gonna go well.
- Well, where I'm from,

27:01.496 --> 27:03.464
you run,
you did something wrong.

27:03.532 --> 27:05.667
- I panicked.
- Well, we spoke to some

27:05.734 --> 27:07.902
of the other employees
that worked on the site.

27:07.970 --> 27:10.939
They said that you programmed
the security code. Yeah, so?

27:11.006 --> 27:13.807
You wrote the code. You were the
only one with high-level access.

27:13.875 --> 27:16.643
What, were you stalking
these people's interactions?

27:16.711 --> 27:18.712
What? No.
That's not even possible.

27:18.780 --> 27:22.348
We traced your IP address.
You created a backdoor.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.785
You were on there
watching them connect.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.955
Let's talk about Crystal Bennett
and Louisa Lopez.

27:28.022 --> 27:28.904
No.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.758
These are the aliases
you created. What kind of game

27:32.826 --> 27:36.062
are you playing? You get off
on watching these guys?

27:36.129 --> 27:38.097
Is that why you lured them
to their deaths?

27:47.239 --> 27:49.540
OK. This, this is crazy.

27:49.609 --> 27:51.542
All right.

27:51.611 --> 27:54.713
- You recognize these men?
- No.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.827
No. Who are they?
These are our murder victims.

27:57.947 --> 27:59.918
These are the men
that you stalked.

28:01.853 --> 28:04.989
No, no, no, no. I didn't...
I didn't kill anyone.

28:05.056 --> 28:07.091
These are some serious
charges, Tom.

28:07.158 --> 28:09.893
Where were you two nights ago?

28:09.961 --> 28:12.630
OK. OK. OK. OK.

28:12.697 --> 28:14.732
I was with someone
out in Pickering.

28:14.799 --> 28:17.400
His name is Leon Riddel. I have the
bus ticket somewhere. You can check.

28:17.468 --> 28:19.902
No. You want to keep your little
affair private, Leon?

28:19.970 --> 28:22.805
Five K. Meet me
at the bus station.

28:25.175 --> 28:27.276
How do you know Leon?

28:27.344 --> 28:29.378
From the Samantha
Matheson site.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.295
But I didn't kill anyone.

28:31.415 --> 28:34.183
- Were you blackmailing him?
- He deserved to pay. He was cheating.

28:34.251 --> 28:36.952
Look, I only set up
these profiles

28:37.020 --> 28:38.954
to find good blackmail targets.

28:39.022 --> 28:40.956
All these guys had
good jobs, nice families...

28:41.024 --> 28:43.125
It says here that your father
left you and your mother

28:43.193 --> 28:45.979
when you were a kid.
Did your dad leave your mom

28:46.099 --> 28:47.596
for another woman?
Is that what this is all about?

28:47.664 --> 28:50.298
Well, none of the other guys I blackmailed
up and left their wife and kids.

28:50.366 --> 28:53.844
But I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah. So you keep saying.

28:53.964 --> 28:55.803
And none of these guys
suspected

28:55.871 --> 28:57.905
that you ID'd them
from the website?

28:57.973 --> 29:01.376
No. I'd make something up. Like I was the
kid, someone their wife worked with,

29:01.443 --> 29:04.207
that kind of thing. Trust me,
once these guys are busted

29:04.327 --> 29:05.413
they don't really want
to ask questions.

29:05.481 --> 29:07.914
But you didn't
kill them, right?

29:07.982 --> 29:11.117
Well, you better hope extortion is the
only thing you're charged with tonight.

29:11.186 --> 29:13.787
- What's next?
- Let's call Leon Riddel.

29:13.854 --> 29:17.052
- Check out his alibi.
- I get a lawyer, right?

29:22.896 --> 29:25.331
<i>Tom had quite the collection</i>

29:25.399 --> 29:29.134
of stalker videos.
I should have made popcorn.

29:29.203 --> 29:32.104
OK, so he caught them
in the act on camera

29:32.172 --> 29:35.774
- then he would demand hush money
-  Doesn't mean he didn't kill our victims.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.776
His exchange with Riddel was on his
mind the night Potter was killed.

29:38.844 --> 29:42.136
So, I just got off the phone
with Leon Riddel.

29:42.256 --> 29:44.549
He saw Tom two nights ago.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.118
- Does he live anywhere near Potter's hotel?
- No. But he paid him off.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.290
However,
his wife still found out

29:48.410 --> 29:52.324
about his extracurricular activities, so
he's willing to charge him with extortion.

29:52.444 --> 29:53.249
Nice.

29:53.369 --> 29:55.678
Martell just spent half an hour
bending my ear.

29:55.798 --> 29:58.029
The British Consulate want
a progress report.

29:58.149 --> 30:00.819
They seem to be more interested in
recovering Jeremy Potter's cell phone

30:00.939 --> 30:02.099
than who actually killed him.

30:02.166 --> 30:05.302
Which means they probably knew about
his secret affair the whole time.

30:05.370 --> 30:08.239
The update is the man that we have
in custody probably did not do it.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.607
I'm not sure that's exactly
what they're looking for.

30:10.674 --> 30:12.675
There's the mother.

30:12.743 --> 30:14.744
Mrs. Walton.

30:14.811 --> 30:17.546
I don't understand
what's going on here.

30:17.666 --> 30:19.686
Why did you take my son?

30:19.806 --> 30:22.612
- Do I need to get a lawyer?
- Follow me.

30:27.056 --> 30:30.292
<i>I'm sure there has to be</i>
<i>some type of mistake here.</i>

30:30.360 --> 30:32.661
My son didn't do
anything wrong.

30:32.729 --> 30:36.431
Well, your son, at the very least,
is facing extortion charges.

30:36.499 --> 30:41.370
What?
What do you mean, extortion?

30:41.437 --> 30:44.438
He blackmailed clients of
a website that he helped create.

30:49.178 --> 30:52.113
That website.
He said he needed the job.

30:52.181 --> 30:55.516
You know what?
It is wrong what you're doing.

30:55.584 --> 30:58.352
- I'm making money.
- Tom, it's not worth it.

30:58.420 --> 31:01.789
- It's wrong!
- It's money that I'm making and you're not!

31:03.758 --> 31:07.261
Thank you, Mrs. Walton. We'll let
you guys consult with your lawyer.

31:12.133 --> 31:15.401
I don't feel sorry
for those men.

31:15.468 --> 31:17.603
I'm sorry, what was that?

31:17.671 --> 31:21.040
<i>I mean, you know, of course,</i>

31:21.108 --> 31:25.678
<i>they didn't deserve to die.</i>
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

31:29.749 --> 31:31.783
(Phone ringing)

31:31.851 --> 31:34.485
- I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

31:34.553 --> 31:37.140
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey Toby! How would you like

31:37.260 --> 31:39.124
to go see an indie play
tomorrow night?

31:39.192 --> 31:41.526
- Play?
- <i>Yeah, it's actors,</i>

31:41.593 --> 31:43.114
<i>on a stage,
and they're saying stuff.</i>

31:43.234 --> 31:46.597
No, I know what a play is. I was just
wondering what I did to piss you off.

31:46.665 --> 31:48.866
- I need a favour.
- This ought to be good.

31:48.934 --> 31:50.968
OK. Look, Sandy wants
to go to the opening night

31:51.036 --> 31:53.103
of her friend's play, but I'm going
to this car show tomorrow night.

31:53.171 --> 31:55.672
You know, I'd rather go
to the car show, to be honest.

31:55.740 --> 31:59.343
No. I'm taking Sandy's dad. But I didn't
want to leave Sandy hanging high and dry.

31:59.410 --> 32:02.746
And you want me to go to a play. An indie play.
With your girlfriend.

32:02.814 --> 32:04.714
When you put it that way, yes.

32:04.781 --> 32:07.683
So, Sandy's cool with you blowing
her off to hang out with her dad?

32:07.751 --> 32:09.719
<i>She knows I'm trying to score
points with her old man.</i>

32:09.786 --> 32:14.290
All right. All right.
You owe me. Huge.

32:14.358 --> 32:16.459
Huge, a huge solid.

32:16.526 --> 32:18.828
You sure that Sandy's cool
with this? Really?

32:18.948 --> 32:21.147
Yes, what did I just say?
Yes, she's cool with it.

32:21.267 --> 32:24.233
- All right. Just text me the information.
- OK, thank you. Thank you.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.335
I will right now. Bye.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.378
If Tom's not our guy,

32:33.498 --> 32:34.909
we still have a killer
on the loose.

32:34.977 --> 32:38.179
- Is there anything suspicious?
- I'm tracking the halfdozen guys

32:38.247 --> 32:40.793
whose profiles most closely
resemble those of our victims.

32:40.913 --> 32:43.050
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

32:43.118 --> 32:45.386
- Can you shut it down?
- The whole site?

32:46.688 --> 32:48.655
I mean, yeah, I have the program

32:48.723 --> 32:51.457
that Tom wrote to subvert
the site's security but...

32:51.525 --> 32:55.328
Our killer is using the agency to target
victims, and we're letting it happen.

32:55.396 --> 32:57.397
But if we shut down the whole
site, how are we supposed to...

32:57.464 --> 33:01.334
There's someone else
in the system at admin level.

33:01.402 --> 33:04.537
What are they doing?

33:04.605 --> 33:08.974
- "Has to be tonight."
- He's watching them make a date.

33:11.778 --> 33:13.645
They're gone.

33:13.713 --> 33:15.480
Can you track them?

33:15.548 --> 33:18.918
I got an IP.

33:18.985 --> 33:21.520
It's the same place.
It's coming from Tom Walton's.

33:21.587 --> 33:25.056
Isn't Tom still in custody?
Get Toby.

33:31.163 --> 33:34.165
So, who else has access
to your Wi-Fi?

33:34.233 --> 33:36.401
- No one. It's secure.
- Someone hacked

33:36.468 --> 33:38.903
into the agency's website
from your IP address.

33:38.970 --> 33:41.771
OK, well, maybe
someone spoofed the IP.

33:41.839 --> 33:44.588
Maybe someone's setting me up. I don't
know, I've been here.

33:44.572 --> 33:45.766
Who else has access?

33:45.886 --> 33:49.479
Someone in the building?
A friend? Another programmer?

33:49.547 --> 33:52.015
(Tom): <i>Oh, my god. Mom...</i>

33:52.083 --> 33:55.517
<i>- The codes... You didn't...</i>
It's your mother, isn't it?

33:55.585 --> 34:00.863
She knows how to breach the agency's
security. She knows the codes.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.230
She taught me everything
that I know.

34:08.297 --> 34:11.766
- Your mother's a programmer?
- Before her breakdown, yeah.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.701
But she couldn't get work
doing it anymore.

34:13.768 --> 34:16.397
Tell Dev the focus is
on the mother.

34:16.516 --> 34:19.121
Please, sir, you have to leave her out of this.
It's not her fault.

34:19.241 --> 34:21.051
He left us with nothing. She
doesn't know what she's doing!

34:21.170 --> 34:23.378
Please leave her alone.
She didn't mean it!

34:26.681 --> 34:30.150
Dev, OK, where are we
with Kay Walton?

34:30.217 --> 34:32.152
I'm tracking her through
registries of an outpatient

34:32.219 --> 34:34.388
psychiatric programs. She was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder

34:34.456 --> 34:37.391
over a decade ago. Looks like she's
currently employed by a cleaning company

34:37.458 --> 34:39.759
that has contracts with most
of the major hotels in the city.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.362
Tom was three years old when her husband
left her. So she was traumatized.

34:42.429 --> 34:45.331
There were alleged incidents
of violent outbursts,

34:45.399 --> 34:49.235
but no arrests. I did find
a picture of her ex-husband.

34:49.303 --> 34:52.170
And he looks a lot
like our victims.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.639
Looks like she has unfinished
business with the ex.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.809
A lot of innocent guys are
paying for it.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.878
So, if she works for a cleaning company, she
has access to any hotel room they service.

34:59.945 --> 35:02.981
Yeah. And it looks like they have a
contract with the Starlight Hotel.

35:03.049 --> 35:05.650
Kay Walton is planning
her next attack tonight.

35:05.718 --> 35:08.753
- Now we know where.
- And when.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.760
I almost can't believe
I'm doing this.

35:16.828 --> 35:19.230
Is this your first time?

35:19.297 --> 35:21.465
- Yeah.
- It's OK. It's mine too.

35:21.533 --> 35:24.468
Really? You're not
just saying that?

35:24.536 --> 35:27.438
It took a while to find
someone I'd be comfortable with.

35:27.506 --> 35:29.806
Here we are.

35:40.417 --> 35:45.320
Mr. Channing... I think you
could say you just got lucky.

35:45.388 --> 35:48.558
IIB. Let's talk.

36:26.757 --> 36:28.875
You're too much.

36:28.995 --> 36:32.261
Back for another go?

36:33.497 --> 36:36.031
It's not going to happen
this time, Kay.

36:36.099 --> 36:38.745
- Put your weapon down, now!
- Drop it!

36:40.804 --> 36:44.940
Please. Put the knife down.
No one has to get hurt.

36:47.243 --> 36:49.378
We know what
you've been through.

36:49.445 --> 36:52.814
You don't know
what I've been through.

36:52.882 --> 36:55.550
You don't know anything!

36:55.618 --> 36:58.949
They... they deserved it!

37:01.056 --> 37:03.524
Your husband cheated on you.

37:04.826 --> 37:07.316
He left me for her.

37:07.436 --> 37:10.964
He left our son.

37:11.032 --> 37:14.690
You can't punish these men
for what your ex-husband did.

37:14.810 --> 37:17.037
You're gonna put their families
through the same thing

37:17.105 --> 37:20.106
that you and Tom went through.
You gotta end this, Kay.

37:24.378 --> 37:29.849
It would have been
our 20th wedding anniversary.

37:33.787 --> 37:35.821
Get down.

37:35.889 --> 37:38.724
Thank you.

37:38.792 --> 37:41.159
Go home to your family.

37:41.227 --> 37:45.697
(Kay crying)

37:53.505 --> 37:56.140
Wow.

37:56.207 --> 38:00.515
All right. Twenty bucks
I know what you're thinking.

38:00.635 --> 38:04.018
- I still owe you $20 from last time.
- Yeah. You do.

38:04.138 --> 38:05.416
Yeah? You think
I'm that predictable?

38:05.483 --> 38:07.417
Yes, on certain issues, yeah.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.591
- OK. Let's hear it.
- All right.

38:09.711 --> 38:12.656
You are thinking that Trevor did
not learn his lesson tonight,

38:12.723 --> 38:14.591
that he's just gonna go
onto another cheating website

38:14.659 --> 38:16.593
and find himself a new Yvette,

38:16.661 --> 38:18.662
that a leopard doesn't
change his spots.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.897
Wow. You are
very wrong, Logan.

38:21.965 --> 38:24.066
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh! I'm thinking the exact opposite.

38:24.133 --> 38:26.101
I think Trevor's
gonna go home tonight,

38:26.169 --> 38:28.103
he's gonna kiss his children,
and he's gonna vow

38:28.171 --> 38:30.305
to never make the same
mistake again.

38:30.373 --> 38:34.009
No. This does not sound like you. You're
trying to win the bet. Do you need to borrow

38:34.077 --> 38:36.445
money from me? Look, I
know I can be predictable.

38:36.513 --> 38:38.546
I know I'm not really a go-
with-the-flow kind of girl.

38:38.614 --> 38:41.315
- And I like control.
- I never knew that about you.

38:41.383 --> 38:44.586
Well...

38:44.653 --> 38:48.490
Maybe it's time for me
to change.

38:48.557 --> 38:51.589
You're going to make
a great mother.

38:53.061 --> 38:56.730
Seriously.

38:56.798 --> 38:59.299
Doesn't mean you don't owe me
20 bucks.

38:59.367 --> 39:02.836
(Laughing)

39:02.904 --> 39:05.105
<i>Our team just recovered</i>

39:05.172 --> 39:08.441
Jeremy Potter's cell phone
from Kay's apartment.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.242
MI6 were relieved to find out

39:10.310 --> 39:12.545
that none of the files were
compromised.

39:12.613 --> 39:14.647
What happens to Kay Walton?

39:14.715 --> 39:17.349
She'll undergo
full psychiatric evaluation.

39:17.417 --> 39:20.419
What about her son?

39:20.487 --> 39:25.391
Well, we still have to figure out how
many people he actually extorted.

39:25.458 --> 39:27.592
Somehow, I don't think too many of
them are going to come forward.

39:27.660 --> 39:31.796
That's why we have subpoenas.
(Laughing)

39:32.624 --> 39:35.245
Any more security breaches?

39:35.365 --> 39:38.202
No. The site hired a new firm
to plug the holes.

39:38.270 --> 39:40.572
Is my profile still on?

39:43.708 --> 39:46.428
The requests keep piling in.

39:46.548 --> 39:48.913
You wanna take a look?
No.

39:48.980 --> 39:50.881
I'm single.
It wouldn't be cheating.

39:50.949 --> 39:54.451
Where's the fun?
Shut it down.

39:56.888 --> 39:59.121
Good job today.

40:02.593 --> 40:05.094
(A bottle pops.)

40:08.465 --> 40:11.267
That really was so good.

40:11.334 --> 40:14.458
Panko crusted.
Who knew?

40:14.578 --> 40:17.351
I thought
I'd try something new.

40:19.442 --> 40:22.110
Are you sure you don't have
to be at the club tonight?

40:22.178 --> 40:25.246
Yeah.

40:25.314 --> 40:27.683
I told them to call if there's
some sort of catastrophe,

40:27.750 --> 40:31.400
but otherwise,
tonight is all about us.

40:36.758 --> 40:39.126
You really are amazing,
you know that?

40:39.194 --> 40:41.261
It was just panko, babe.
(Laughing)

40:41.329 --> 40:44.164
I honestly...
they said it was amazing.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.435
I'm sorry for making you wait.

40:49.503 --> 40:51.337
- Don't...
- No.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.474
You deserve an answer.

40:57.444 --> 40:59.746
When the time is right, Mich.

40:59.814 --> 41:02.114
I'm ready.

41:05.752 --> 41:07.686
Now?

41:08.823 --> 41:11.499
If you're ready.

41:14.327 --> 41:17.129
I'm ready.
(Laughing)

41:25.170 --> 41:27.204
(Sandy): Oz, we're here.

41:29.875 --> 41:32.476
Come on in.

41:32.544 --> 41:35.123
- I cleaned up a bit.
- Hi.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.162
Hey. Bill, this is my good
friend Toby. Toby, Bill.

41:38.282 --> 41:39.410
- Hey.
- Toby?

41:39.530 --> 41:41.551
- Yeah.
- You're taking my daughter to the play?

41:41.619 --> 41:43.887
Actually, there's been a bit
of a change of plans.

41:43.955 --> 41:46.757
Toby's gonna come with you
to the car show.

41:46.824 --> 41:49.425
- Yeah!
- Oh. Why?

41:49.493 --> 41:51.961
Well, I know you're only in
town for a short amount of time

41:52.029 --> 41:55.564
and I really wanted to get to know you
better, but I actually told Sandy

41:55.632 --> 41:59.135
that I would go to this play with
her tonight. In fact, I promised, so...

41:59.202 --> 42:01.963
- Oz, you really don't...
- I actually do.

42:02.083 --> 42:06.041
I'm sorry, Bill. I can't go
with you to the show.

42:06.108 --> 42:08.409
I think you're making
a good choice.

42:08.477 --> 42:10.645
- You do?
- I do.

42:10.713 --> 42:12.847
Oh, OK.

42:12.915 --> 42:15.550
The only way you're gonna
impress me is if you

42:15.617 --> 42:18.286
treat my daughter right.

42:18.353 --> 42:21.422
Oh, great! Look at that.
All right. Great.

42:21.490 --> 42:24.658
- Bill, thank you. Thank you.
- So, Toby...

42:24.726 --> 42:27.861
Yeah, let's do this.

42:27.929 --> 42:31.732
- Oz is a good friend of yours?
- Yeah. I've known him a long time.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.434
- Good. I wanna hear all about him.
- Yeah. I've got some stories.

42:34.502 --> 42:37.337
- You guys have fun at the indie play.
- Uh, Toby, actually, could you

42:37.405 --> 42:39.772
just... hang on... just for
a second, before you go? Toby!

42:39.840 --> 42:42.041
- That's gonna be fine, right?
- It's gonna be fine.

42:42.109 --> 42:44.018
It's not like he has any dirt
on me or anything.

42:44.138 --> 42:45.316
It's gonna be fine.
