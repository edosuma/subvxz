that you mentioned before--

14:39.748 --> 14:41.358
it's, uh, pretty much
a gas giant, right?

14:41.402 --> 14:42.707
Where exactly is it?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.928
200 million kilometers away.
But Captain,

14:45.972 --> 14:48.278
it is tethered in orbit
around a black hole.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.933
Like, how big of a black hole?

14:50.977 --> 14:53.109
One problem at a time.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.330
Can we maneuver
inside the brown dwarf?

14:56.373 --> 14:57.766
While technically possible,

14:57.809 --> 14:59.376
there are a number
of dangers involved.

15:01.509 --> 15:04.120
Shields at 40%.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.382
Bottom-line it for me.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.949
The central mass
of the brown dwarf

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
has a density that will
crush the entire ship.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.214
-Surrounding that
is a volatile gas cloud.
-How volatile?

15:11.258 --> 15:13.260
Enterprisewill need to lower
its electrical output.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.566
Primary and auxiliary systems
need to go off-line.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.265
We will lose sensors, optics,
long-range communications

15:18.308 --> 15:19.962
and, most importantly,
the shields.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.311
We'll be running dark.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.487
-That sounds...
-Perfect.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.402
Anything following us
will have to do the same.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.665
If you're right,
it's our best shot.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.537
You're the acting
Number One again. Do you concur?

15:29.580 --> 15:31.452
Yes, sir.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.671
Helm, full impulse
to Spock's mark.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.978
Aye aye. Full impulse.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.502
Into a giant gas cloud of death.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.939
Why not?

15:58.218 --> 16:01.264
Captain, Sickbay and their cargo
stores just took direct fire.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.661
As did the Main Cargo Bay.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.750
[alarms blaring]

16:23.939 --> 16:25.897
Lieutenant Hemmer?
Lieutenant Hemmer?!

16:25.941 --> 16:27.160
[Hemmer groans]

16:29.162 --> 16:31.381
Please get this off me.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.470
[groaning, grunting]

16:36.343 --> 16:38.084
[grunting]

16:46.875 --> 16:48.833
[sharp exhale]

16:48.877 --> 16:50.966
Oh. It's broken.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.012
Well, let's get you to Sickbay.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.844
-The door is blocked, isn't it?
-Yep.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.761
-[machine whirrs down]
-[new alarms blaring]

17:07.939 --> 17:09.376
How long before it blows?

17:09.419 --> 17:11.334
I have time
to stabilize the unit.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.206
An explosion
of that magnitude w...

17:13.249 --> 17:16.296
Would consume theEnterprise
in an atomic blast. Yes.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.776
Transporters are off-line. We'll
send in a team to dig you out.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.388
Either way,
I'll be here repairing.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.780
Hemmer out.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.826
Is it just me
or is it hot in here?

17:24.869 --> 17:27.394
The ionic gas surrounding
the ship is overwhelming

17:27.437 --> 17:29.526
climate controls.
Many systems are down.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.529
Including Sickbay.
Everything is off-line.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.837
We're stabilizing patients,
but without medical systems,

17:35.880 --> 17:39.580
no one is getting better.
It's triage.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.103
Casualties?

17:41.147 --> 17:44.106
Yes, Captain. Nine confirmed.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.805
The hit we took decimated
our stock of treatment supplies.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.807
And with the matter synthesizers
also off-line,

17:49.851 --> 17:52.680
we can't make more
when we run out.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.030
-How's Una?
-She reports that she's fine.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.597
She's on her way in.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.468
I haven't had time
to check her yet.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.253
We're still playing catch-up.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.603
I've activated
all backup medical personnel,

18:02.646 --> 18:05.388
but what I really need
down here are supplies.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.738
CHAPEL:
Doctor, I could really
use some help over here.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.914
M'Benga out.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.400
-[alarm blaring]
-[indistinct chatter]

18:23.885 --> 18:25.669
Doctor!

18:30.457 --> 18:31.849
You said you were fine.

18:31.893 --> 18:32.807
I was mistaken.

18:32.850 --> 18:33.982
These are deep.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.159
We can't power up
the surgery bays.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.338
If I recall,
you have an interest

18:42.382 --> 18:43.948
in archeological medicine.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.257
How good are you at sewing?

18:49.258 --> 18:50.694
Aces.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.875
No weapons systems, no phasers.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.530
What about photon torpedoes?
Those can be self-guided.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.794
The torpedo bay was hit in
the attack. We lost all but one.

19:03.838 --> 19:07.058
We only have one photon torpedo?

19:07.102 --> 19:08.582
The amount is inconsequential.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.062
If we fire a torpedo
inside the brown dwarf,

19:11.106 --> 19:13.021
the atmospheric composition
will cause a failure

19:13.064 --> 19:14.979
in the internal systems.
It would propel

19:15.023 --> 19:17.678
in a random direction, likely
missing its intended target.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.811
So, no shields and no weapons.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.987
What do we do--

19:23.031 --> 19:25.381
throw luggage at them?

19:25.425 --> 19:28.993
And the Gorn-- really?
We're out here fighting the...

19:29.037 --> 19:30.778
the boogeyman?
No one has even seen one.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.128
So how are we supposed
to take them on?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.174
I've seen them.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.873
They aren't supernatural.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.745
But they are monsters.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.620
The Federation teaches that if
we can find a way to empathize

19:46.663 --> 19:50.189
with an enemy then they can
one day become our friends.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.060
They're wrong.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.150
Some things in this universe
are just plain evil.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.065
Have you ever seen eyes
that are both

19:57.108 --> 19:59.372
dead and hungry
at the same time?

19:59.415 --> 20:02.026
To them, humans are just
walking feed bags

20:02.070 --> 20:06.161
of flesh and bone and jelly.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.250
The Gorn trigger
a primitive, ancient, terror

20:08.294 --> 20:10.165
in warm-blooded species.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.124
We are prey.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.866
And when they hunt,
they're unrelenting.

20:15.910 --> 20:19.696
The truth is plenty of people
have seen the Gorn.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.612
They just don't live
long enough to talk about it.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.053
All right.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.232
Be vigilant.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.059
Get creative.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.887
You're the best of Starfleet.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
We survive this
by working together.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.288
[door whooshes open]

20:46.332 --> 20:48.551
A moment, Lieutenant.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.640
[door whooshes closed]

20:51.685 --> 20:53.077
How you holding up?

20:55.079 --> 20:56.690
The enemy doesn't care
about my feelings, Captain,

20:56.733 --> 20:58.735
so I don't waste my time
having any.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.303
Well, that may be true,
but it's not

21:01.347 --> 21:03.653
looking that way to the crew.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.307
With all due respect,

21:05.351 --> 21:06.917
you know me well enough
to know that I don't care

21:06.961 --> 21:08.571
what the crew thinks.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.704
I've always been blunt.
That's just who I am.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.315
Direct, looking at outcomes,
not emotion.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.838
-Exactly.
-But right now, your job

21:14.882 --> 21:17.667
isn't just about orders,
it's about hope.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.280
Belief can be the difference
between victory and defeat.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.369
Get a crew
to believe in miracles,

21:23.412 --> 21:25.066
they might just give you one.

21:25.109 --> 21:28.374
I will make the adjustment.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.376
But I will not lie to them.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.380
The best miracles
are born from truth.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.687
Understood, Captain.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.995
Now, there's not much
on the official record.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.563
Is there anything else
you can remember

21:43.606 --> 21:44.651
from your time with the Gorn--

21:44.694 --> 21:46.305
anything that might help?

21:49.046 --> 21:52.136
The memories of what happened
are, um,

21:52.180 --> 21:55.139
trauma-inhibited.
The... It's all...

21:55.183 --> 21:58.012
it's-it's...
it's all fragments.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.927
Bit-Bits and pieces.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.539
Well, if anything comes to mind.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.068
[alarms blaring]

22:14.942 --> 22:16.770
An engineer's
most important tools

22:16.813 --> 22:18.946
are his mind and his hands.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.557
And I can't move my fingers.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.907
-[groans]
-Oh... Okay.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.475
Let's just...

22:26.519 --> 22:29.870
work on relaxing.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.699
[new alarm beeping]

22:35.136 --> 22:36.572
Here's what's gonna happen:

22:36.616 --> 22:38.357
you're gonna
talk me through what to do.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.010
We're gonna be a team.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.577
It's not that simple.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.884
There's a variety of data
that only I can assess.

22:43.927 --> 22:46.843
And I'm the only one here
with a working set of fingers.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.324
I am not fond of teams.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.326
Get fond.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.025
It would seem I have to.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.507
Start by using
the control panel to shut down

22:58.551 --> 23:00.553
the safety override.
You'll have to

23:00.596 --> 23:02.903
adjust the cooling system.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.778
What did I do?

23:08.822 --> 23:11.433
Your other hand operates
the cooling system as you work.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.653
Take the time to get focused.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.178
Don't let the core
get above 110 degrees.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.052
[boatswain's whistle blows]

23:22.096 --> 23:23.924
Captain, a moment please?

23:23.967 --> 23:25.404
You have something, Spock?

23:25.447 --> 23:27.057
You challenged us
to get creative.

23:27.101 --> 23:30.234
Computer, run program Vinci 7.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.240
Primary sensors
aren't available.

23:36.284 --> 23:37.546
But navigation systems
constantly take in

23:37.590 --> 23:39.766
atmospheric data
to maintain stability.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.856
Hey, I still
do most of the work.

23:42.899 --> 23:45.119
A ship traveling through
the gas cloud creates

23:45.162 --> 23:47.861
oscillation in the atmosphere.
These are converted into

23:47.904 --> 23:50.298
-rotational motions by...
-ORTEGAS: Coriolis forces.

23:50.341 --> 23:53.127
Which the nav-com
detects automatically.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.782
Marking Coriolis force readings
would allow us to triangulate

23:55.825 --> 23:59.394
movement inside the gas giant.
We can track the Gorn.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.746
You just turned a compass
into a radar.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.574
Do it.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.714
It's working.
We've got a signal.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.716
Analysis?

24:16.759 --> 24:20.328
The size and speed indicate
it is the ship that attacked us.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.638
They're coming right at us.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.118
ETA is one minute.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.729
Can they see us?

24:29.772 --> 24:31.513
It is impossible
to tell, Captain.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.602
Captain, evasive maneuvers?

24:33.646 --> 24:36.257
Negative. Keep her steady.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.395
Captain.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.107
Preparing to engage the enemy

25:01.674 --> 25:03.806
Keep her steady, helm.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.808
Aye.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.598
The enemy has altered
its course.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.296
They can't see us.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.690
But they won't stop looking.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.868
Zuniga, arm the last torpedo.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.609
Arming torpedo.

25:24.610 --> 25:28.570
Captain, I must remind you that
if you fire a photon torpedo

25:28.614 --> 25:31.181
inside a brown dwarf the
guidance systems will not work.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.575
I don't plan on firing it.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.490
We're gonna
drop it on them manually.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.493
Now we're talking.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.539
PIKE:
Set a course to pursue
the enemy vessel.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.844
Quick but quiet, Erica.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.194
That is my specialty.

25:50.461 --> 25:51.898
PIKE:
Put us right over her,

25:51.941 --> 25:53.900
then tilt axis 90 degrees.

25:53.943 --> 25:56.467
Once the hatch opens,
the higher mass below

25:56.511 --> 25:59.558
should pull the torpedo
straight down. On my mark.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.100
Deploy torpedo.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.320
Bombs away.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.945
The signal is gone.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.599
The enemy ship
has been destroyed.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.568
Captain, we have incoming.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.135
Multiple incoming.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.490
They wanted us to fire.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.275
They sacrificed an entire ship
just to get our location.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.539
ORTEGAS:
Why is that blip so much bigger?

27:23.816 --> 27:26.035
Three on one. Not good.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.994
We're outgunned.
Time to run, sir.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.910
I concur. But if we leave the
brown dwarf they will see us.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.042
If we go deeper,
it could destroy the ship.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.827
Good thinking, Mr. Spock.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.003
We need to go deeper
into the brown dwarf.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.700
That is not what I suggested.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.702
Ortegas, plot a course.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.009
-As close as you can get us
to center mass.
-Sure.

27:43.052 --> 27:47.535
Didn't our science expert just
say that would crush the ship?
Just asking, Sir.

27:47.578 --> 27:50.059
SPOCK:
I did. The pressure
against the hull

27:50.103 --> 27:52.496
will increase the deeper we go.
If we venture too close,

27:52.540 --> 27:54.368
the density field
will obliterate us.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.936
Whatever happens to us
will also happen to the Gorn.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.112
I believe in Enterprise.

27:59.155 --> 28:00.635
We can outlast them.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.115
LA'AN:
Captain, the lower decks

28:02.158 --> 28:03.899
will be first
to take structural damage.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.946
Immediate evacuation
of all decks below 20.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.513
I don't like it either,
but Enterprisehas to dive.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.732
Helm, take us down.

28:10.776 --> 28:14.214
Aye aye, Skipper.
Dive, dive, dive.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.913
[alarm continues blaring]

28:17.957 --> 28:19.741
[Una hisses]

28:22.962 --> 28:25.616
[metal groaning]

28:38.891 --> 28:40.327
[Una groans]

28:40.370 --> 28:41.981
[walls rattling]

28:42.024 --> 28:44.070
[ship groans]

28:47.943 --> 28:50.729
I've never heard a ship
make a sound like that before.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.035
No. Keep your focus.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.124
And maybe pick up the pace.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.955
[exclaims]
This isn't easy. And I...

28:59.999 --> 29:01.957
and, of course,
diagnostics are off-line.

29:02.001 --> 29:03.654
I can't tell which ones
are broken.

29:03.698 --> 29:06.614
Hold your hand out to each.
Tell me what you feel.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.664
-[sizzle]
-Aah! Hot!

29:13.708 --> 29:15.144
I did not say touch them.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.581
The malfunctioning rods
should be cool.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.670
Be sure before you remove them.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.807
All right, I think
I've got a cold one.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.289
Perfect.
Now lift it out gently.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.990
[laughs]
Look at us! Come on!

29:35.034 --> 29:36.775
And the crowd goes wild.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.864
Before replacing it,

29:38.907 --> 29:42.519
we have to reconfigure
the host platform.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.482
Reconfigure the...

29:49.483 --> 29:50.745
Done.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.921
Now we can get started.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.883
Get started?

29:57.926 --> 29:59.972
[ship groaning]

30:16.423 --> 30:18.251
The lower decks
are beginning to buckle.

30:18.294 --> 30:21.210
The evacuation isn't complete.
There's still crew down there.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.559
Get them out.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.083
Decks are collapsing.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.867
If we do not seal them off now,
loss of pressure

30:25.911 --> 30:27.826
could spread to the entire ship.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.831
Seal the bulkheads.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.224
Sir.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.321
Uh, hey, hey!

30:45.365 --> 30:47.410
-Hey.
-[groans]

30:47.454 --> 30:48.716
I got you. I got you.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.723
[grunts] Go!

30:55.766 --> 30:56.724
No, no, no, no!

30:56.767 --> 30:58.030
[shouts]

31:03.426 --> 31:07.169
Structural collapse on Deck 22.
We've lost one crew person.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.435
You made the logical choice.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.872
Why doesn't it feel like that?

31:14.916 --> 31:17.876
For the same reason you made it.
Because you value life.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.095
Captain, we're approaching
critical hull failure.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.923
If antimatter chambers
become compromised,

31:21.967 --> 31:23.838
there will be no ship
left to save.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.926
LA'AN:
Enterprisecan't take
much more of this.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.754
We're overextended.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.454
You said they wanted to take us
prisoner, Number One?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.631
Well, if they think they're
gonna board the Enterprise,

31:34.675 --> 31:37.373
they're gonna find one hell
of a fight. Battle stations.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.767
Make ready for close quarters.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.033
Ortegas, full stop.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.122
Aye, sir. Full stop.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.516
[engines power down]

31:54.216 --> 31:57.263
Captain. The enemy ship.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.714
It appears the Gorn vessel
could not withstand

32:13.757 --> 32:16.543
the atmospheric pressure.
It has imploded.

32:21.635 --> 32:25.160
You said when the
Gorn hunt they are relentless.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.770
They don't stop.

32:26.814 --> 32:29.556
You exploited that
as a weakness.

32:29.599 --> 32:30.992
Get me a damage report.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.689
Mr. Spock, keep scanning
for the other two ships.

32:42.786 --> 32:46.225
Two down, two to go.
Doing good.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.493
How's it going?

32:53.536 --> 32:55.712
Think I'm a little like
Frankenstein's monster,

32:55.756 --> 32:57.888
but I'll be all right.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.847
There's one fragment left.

32:59.890 --> 33:02.981
The intrusion
on her abdominal aorta.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.421
Okay, what are you
not telling me?

33:08.464 --> 33:09.813
We need to sedate you.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.076
The location of the fragment--

33:11.119 --> 33:12.773
You're gonna bleed. A lot.

33:14.470 --> 33:18.518
We have just enough plasma,
but...

33:18.561 --> 33:21.086
we're gonna have to give
it to you via IV.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.609
Do I have a choice?

33:23.784 --> 33:25.046
M'BENGA:
You can decline.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.743
Wait for the systems
to be online.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.050
We can take bets on when
septic shock will begin.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.270
I hear it's like giving birth
out your mouth.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.576
Who says something like that?

33:34.838 --> 33:36.275
Me.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.973
Give me the gas.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.367
Okay.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.630
[gas hisses]

33:43.673 --> 33:45.806
Just breathe.
You'll start to feel drowsy.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.156
Nurse.
She needs plasma.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.810
There's none left.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.206
Give her mine.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.816
It's the last one.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.861
You're about to lose
a massive amount of blood.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.950
That's an order.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.441
PIKE:
Captain's Log, supplemental.
Enterprise is currently

34:12.485 --> 34:15.096
in the center of a gas giant
hiding from an enemy

34:15.140 --> 34:16.880
we've never faced before.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.363
So far, three civilians
and seven of my crew

34:21.407 --> 34:23.757
have lost their lives.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.325
The battle is far from over.

34:26.368 --> 34:29.415
But I am determined
to keep everyone else alive.

34:31.373 --> 34:35.290
My newest obstacle is the
presence of a nearby black hole.

34:35.334 --> 34:36.639
Atmospheric density
is decreasing.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.989
I believe the singularity
is advancing

34:39.033 --> 34:41.122
its accumulation
of substellar material.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.299
Do you ever speak
in plain English?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.955
The brown dwarf
we're hiding inside

34:47.998 --> 34:49.652
is being sucked into
a black hole.

34:49.696 --> 34:50.697
We stay, we will go with it.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.047
Precisely.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.657
LA'AN:
And we can't pop our heads up

34:54.701 --> 34:56.659
to see if it's clear to leave.
They could see us.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.096
Without long-range
communication,

34:58.139 --> 34:59.488
we cannot even send a probe.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.449
How much time before we can't
escape the black hole's gravity?

35:03.492 --> 35:05.451
One hour, 32 minutes
and 48 seconds.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.061
What about a shuttle?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.672
Small enough
to navigate undetected.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.544
Minimize risk
to the rest of the crew.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.154
That sounds like
a suicide mission.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.896
LA'AN:
Captain, a shuttle
is our only shot.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.638
You don't have to order
anyone to go.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.509
I'll do it.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.207
As will I.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.905
To put it in plain English:
you will need backup.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.694
Take the Galileo.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.914
Get back here in 30 minutes,
no matter what.

35:34.958 --> 35:35.829
Sir.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.340
SPOCK:
Fascinating.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.516
Why scan each other?

36:10.559 --> 36:12.909
LA'AN:
No. It's not a scan, it's...

36:14.694 --> 36:16.086
...something else.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.436
You've seen this before.

36:17.479 --> 36:18.959
When you were
attacked by the Gorn.

36:19.002 --> 36:22.092
The SS Puget Sound.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.920
That was the name
of our colony ship.

36:28.577 --> 36:31.101
I remember some. A lot of it is
just...

36:31.145 --> 36:32.799
flashes in the dark.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.062
But I know
I've seen those lights.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.672
The mind is complex.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.457
When faced with intense trauma

36:38.500 --> 36:41.155
it can manifest intricate
defenses to aid survival.

36:43.375 --> 36:46.291
I feel like there's
something in there.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.945
Something I should know.

36:48.989 --> 36:52.514
Understandable, given the enemy
we are currently facing.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.037
You can help me.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.780
I've heard what Vulcans can do.

36:57.824 --> 37:01.088
The mind meld is not a shortcut
for dealing with mental trauma.

37:01.131 --> 37:04.265
Resurfacing hidden memories
can be painful,

37:04.309 --> 37:05.875
even dangerous.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.313
If somewhere in my head
is the answer to saving

37:08.356 --> 37:10.445
the Enterprise,then that's
a risk I have to take.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.273
I can't just keep running.

37:27.027 --> 37:30.422
SPOCK:
My mind to your mind.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.772
My thoughts to your thoughts.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.905
My mind to your thoughts.
To your...

37:35.949 --> 37:38.212
[voice grows distorted, distant]

37:38.256 --> 37:39.953
GIRL: Mom?

37:39.996 --> 37:43.173
-WOMAN: La'An, be brave.
-MALE: Evacuate the ship!

37:43.217 --> 37:45.828
LA'AN:
Not believing you're gonna die
is what gets you killed.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.266
SPOCK:
Your memories
are starting to surface.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.576
This is a Gorn breeding planet.

37:59.712 --> 38:02.236
They brought us here as food
for their hatchlings.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.805
Hunted us day and night.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.729
Your mind is resisting.
You are...

38:16.772 --> 38:18.296
Scared.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.387
I don't like this place.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.390
Do you want to stop?

38:28.088 --> 38:29.611
No.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.572
I can do this.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.661
I need to know.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.801
[shuddering breaths]

38:47.063 --> 38:49.109
[panting]

39:04.777 --> 39:06.779
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.042
-I was trying to be quiet.
-It's okay.

39:09.085 --> 39:10.870
-[growling, clucking]
-I was trying to be quiet.
-It's okay, it's okay.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.263
It's okay. Look at me.
La'An, it's okay.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.614
Right here.
Right here, right here,

39:15.657 --> 39:16.876
right here.
Keep looking at me.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.007
They're coming.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.574
Take this.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.707
It'll help you hide.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.491
The lights. I watched them.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.145
It's how
they talk to each other.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.886
It's all in there.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.931
What are you doing?

39:28.975 --> 39:30.063
You need to run.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.761
Don't be afraid.
Don't look back.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.503
J-Just run.
Keep moving, no matter what.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.591
Okay?

39:38.854 --> 39:41.770
-Come with me.
-I can't.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.102
Run, La'An.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.017
Run!

40:16.283 --> 40:18.677
What happened?

40:20.374 --> 40:24.160
Your subconscious
is setting a boundary.

40:26.641 --> 40:27.990
The lights-- they're a code.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.471
My brother showed me
how to read it.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.736
[Spock speaking Vulcan]

40:38.044 --> 40:40.089
BURNHAM:
I love you too.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.752
You lost someone too,
didn't you?

40:53.059 --> 40:54.800
You had a...

40:54.843 --> 40:56.671
a sister.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.458
But Starfleet records
don't show any...

41:00.501 --> 41:02.024
They do not.

41:06.507 --> 41:09.118
She sacrificed herself
for you, too, didn't she?

41:11.425 --> 41:13.906
I think we should
end this mind meld now.

41:26.222 --> 41:27.833
Spock, I have an idea.

41:36.058 --> 41:39.540
I've modulated the shuttle's
phasers per your instruction.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.281
Surprised you agreed to this.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.762
I believe it is a good plan.

41:43.805 --> 41:46.068
And our mind meld
reminded me of risks taken

41:46.112 --> 41:48.375
and their value
to those that survive.

41:55.730 --> 41:58.080
LA'AN:
I just told them humans boarded
and took over the vessel.

41:58.124 --> 42:00.256
At least I hope I did.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.955
Culling the weak
makes them stronger.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.609
Survival of the fittest.

42:25.673 --> 42:27.588
[alarms blaring]

42:32.332 --> 42:35.901
[sighs]
And Uhura for the win.

42:36.902 --> 42:39.078
-[groaning softly]
-Oh, stay awake.

42:39.121 --> 42:41.733
Okay?
Let's get you talking.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.257
Uh... So, an Aenar

42:44.300 --> 42:47.913
in Starfleet--
how's that even work?

42:47.956 --> 42:49.741
Thought you guys
were all pacifists.

42:49.784 --> 42:53.875
I actually
wanted to be a botanist.

42:53.919 --> 42:55.573
Love flora.

42:57.226 --> 43:00.621
I will not fight for Starfleet.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.928
But I will defend its ideals.

43:02.971 --> 43:05.017
Pacifism is not passivity.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.019
It is the active protection

43:07.062 --> 43:09.935
of all living things
in the natural universe.

43:11.327 --> 43:13.591
A matter of perspective.

43:13.634 --> 43:15.984
Like using touch
instead of sight.

43:18.204 --> 43:19.640
I wouldn't know.

43:19.684 --> 43:22.469
[new alarm blaring]

43:22.512 --> 43:24.863
The matrix
exceeded critical limits

43:24.906 --> 43:26.168
before we completed repairs.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.822
Our only option now is to vent

43:27.866 --> 43:30.172
this bay and everything in it
into space.

43:30.216 --> 43:32.174
But...

43:32.218 --> 43:34.568
we're in here, too.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.485
Unfortunately,
that is also true.

43:43.969 --> 43:46.319
We have 20 minutes until
the unit explodes. Maybe less.

43:46.362 --> 43:48.147
Acknowledged. Stand by.

43:48.190 --> 43:50.758
Welcome back, Lieutenants.
Good job.

43:50.802 --> 43:52.368
Though we're not
out of the woods yet.

43:54.544 --> 43:56.503
Report.

43:56.546 --> 43:59.201
It's not the Gorn.
It's this guy.

44:00.942 --> 44:02.814
The brown dwarf
is dissolving too fast.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.163
We are losing our cover.

44:04.206 --> 44:05.338
We don't get out of here
pretty fast,

44:05.381 --> 44:06.905
we're gonna be sitting ducks.

44:06.948 --> 44:08.733
Except that last Gorn ship
will be on top of us

44:08.776 --> 44:10.256
the instant we leave.

44:10.299 --> 44:12.954
Space really wants us dead.

44:12.998 --> 44:15.348
Then why don't we
let space win?

44:15.391 --> 44:18.612
Spock, could we
use the black hole's gravity

44:18.656 --> 44:20.005
to slingshot us to safety?

44:20.048 --> 44:21.528
Mathematically,
that is possible.

44:21.571 --> 44:22.921
But the Gorn will see us

44:22.964 --> 44:24.792
and have the opportunity
to pursue us.

44:24.836 --> 44:27.229
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

44:27.273 --> 44:28.970
Explain gravitational redshift.

44:29.014 --> 44:30.972
Gravitational redshift
is an optical illusion

44:31.016 --> 44:33.671
that occurs as an object
falls into a black hole.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.977
The object falls faster than
the frequency of light it emits.

44:36.021 --> 44:38.153
To any outside observer,
it would appear as though

44:38.197 --> 44:40.721
the object has stopped
just outside the black hole.

44:40.765 --> 44:42.331
Last question. What do

44:42.375 --> 44:44.333
snakes, ducks, and possums
all have in common?

44:45.552 --> 44:47.946
When hunted, they play dead.

44:49.512 --> 44:51.863
Ortegas, plot a course to take
us close to the event horizon.

44:51.906 --> 44:54.474
Hemmer, you and the cadet
have access to EV suits?

44:54.517 --> 44:56.694
HEMMER:
We do, sir.
I hesitate to ask why.

44:56.737 --> 44:58.826
You're going to slingshot
off the black hole

44:58.870 --> 45:02.351
and drop the AP 350 as a decoy?

45:05.659 --> 45:08.444
Captain, your plan requires
flying the Enterprise

45:08.488 --> 45:11.230
into one of the most
turbulent phenomenons in space.

45:11.273 --> 45:12.622
Hull integrity
is already compromised.

45:12.666 --> 45:14.233
-That kind of force...
-She'll hold.

45:15.408 --> 45:18.628
The Enterprise
is going to make it.

45:18.672 --> 45:20.456
She'll hold.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.763
We've got this.

45:22.807 --> 45:24.678
Erica, if anyone can

45:24.722 --> 45:26.549
surf a wave on a black hole,
it's you.

45:26.593 --> 45:28.551
Ah, now you almost
make it sound fun.

45:28.595 --> 45:30.597
Suit up, strap in.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.686
We're venting the hold
on my signal.

45:35.515 --> 45:37.647
I commit you to the cosmos.

45:43.610 --> 45:46.526
I'm giving you high marks
on your assessment today.

45:46.569 --> 45:48.267
You impressed me after all.

45:48.310 --> 45:50.835
Assuming that will
still matter...

45:50.878 --> 45:52.401
thank you.

45:53.446 --> 45:56.231
Humans waste so much life
worrying about death.

45:56.275 --> 45:58.451
The Aenar believe
the end only comes

45:58.494 --> 45:59.844
once you have
fulfilled your purpose.

45:59.887 --> 46:02.107
-It provides meaning.
-I-I like that.

46:02.150 --> 46:03.848
So, what was your purpose?

46:03.891 --> 46:06.198
To fix what is broken.

46:06.241 --> 46:08.374
You can throw in teaching.

46:08.417 --> 46:10.202
Maybe even being inspiring.

46:10.245 --> 46:11.420
A little.

46:11.464 --> 46:13.292
[laughs]

46:13.335 --> 46:15.120
And you?

46:15.163 --> 46:17.687
What do you feel is the purpose
of your life's path?

46:19.298 --> 46:23.128
I really don't know.

46:23.171 --> 46:25.130
Does that mean
I'm not gonna die?

46:25.173 --> 46:26.827
There's only one way
to find out.

46:33.181 --> 46:35.488
ZUNIGA:
Inertial dampers at max.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.142
Brace for heavy gravity.

46:37.185 --> 46:38.926
ORTEGAS:
We pull this off,

46:38.970 --> 46:41.494
it's officially
The Pike Maneuver.

46:41.537 --> 46:44.453
Open a channel. Ship-wide.

46:47.326 --> 46:49.371
Attention, this is
the Captain speaking.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.418
Earlier today, we were reminded

46:52.461 --> 46:54.899
of the cost of exploration.

46:54.942 --> 46:58.076
What it means
to chart the stars,

46:58.119 --> 47:00.165
to push the boundaries
of what is known

47:00.208 --> 47:02.254
and what is possible.

47:03.559 --> 47:06.127
When we seek out the unknown,
we will find things

47:06.171 --> 47:08.826
that challenge us.

47:08.869 --> 47:11.611
That frighten us.

47:11.654 --> 47:13.613
But we do not back down.

47:13.656 --> 47:16.485
We do not give in to fear.

47:17.791 --> 47:20.794
And I believe today
will not be our last mission,

47:20.838 --> 47:23.579
but our finest hour.

47:24.537 --> 47:26.582
All hands make ready for impact.

47:48.822 --> 47:50.693
Gorn ship changing course.

47:50.737 --> 47:52.782
Accretion disc in sight.

47:54.349 --> 47:55.873
Hit it.

47:59.528 --> 48:01.574
[ship groaning, rattling]

48:11.889 --> 48:13.891
Vent the hold!

48:17.982 --> 48:19.984
[both exclaiming, grunting]

48:42.876 --> 48:44.660
Ortegas.

48:45.661 --> 48:47.707
[engines whirring up]

49:25.136 --> 49:26.093
Report.

49:26.137 --> 49:28.008
No sign of the Gorn.

49:28.052 --> 49:30.097
They've gone, sir. We did it.

49:31.098 --> 49:32.839
Show me Main Cargo Bay.

49:44.024 --> 49:45.808
Pike to Main Cargo Bay.

49:49.029 --> 49:50.291
Hemmer.

49:50.335 --> 49:53.555
Hemmer? Uhura?

49:53.599 --> 49:55.122
Report.

50:07.265 --> 50:10.833
La'An. Send a recovery team.

50:10.877 --> 50:13.532
UHURA:
We're here, sir.
We're still here.

50:30.114 --> 50:32.638
[sighs]

50:33.682 --> 50:35.206
Well, I don't know about you...

50:37.295 --> 50:39.079
...but...

50:39.123 --> 50:40.994
I think that was
quite a miracle.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.564
What about next time?

50:45.607 --> 50:48.871
The Gorn have never
come this far before.

50:48.915 --> 50:52.397
They're opening up
new hunting grounds.

50:52.440 --> 50:56.009
Next time.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.838
Next time, they...

50:58.881 --> 51:00.927
they won't catch us by surprise.

51:04.974 --> 51:07.020
We'll be ready for 'em.

52:05.557 --> 52:06.949
LA'AN:
Personal log,

52:06.993 --> 52:09.778
stardate 3177.9.

52:11.128 --> 52:14.218
Today, theEnterprise
encountered the Gorn.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.961
Seven of the crew...

52:19.005 --> 52:21.050
gave their lives.

52:31.104 --> 52:32.497
But...

52:34.760 --> 52:36.936
...we survived.
