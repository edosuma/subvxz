00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Excuse me.

00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:12.226
Sorry.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.393
Excuse me.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Sorry.

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:34.468
Hi. Where's your bathroom?

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.000
It's for customers only.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oh, okay. I'll buy something.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.000
You gotta pay up there.

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:46.822
Can I just go now? I really have to pee.

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:49.000
I've got a large cappuccino for Skylar.

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:50.251
Thanks.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.255
I also kind of, well, no...

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.019
I know that establishments
that serve food or drink must

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.975
be open to the public regardless
of their purchasing class.

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.000
Sorry, it's our policy.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:06.190
Store policy can't really supersede state law.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.441
Please, it's an emergency.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.466
Caramel latte for Miranda.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.372
Honey, I'm about to order. Do you want your usual?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.000
Uh.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.377
My wife would like a
double espresso

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:23.388
although you've had trouble
sleeping lately, right babe?

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:25.908
Maybe we should back
it off to a single.

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.675
You kept the light on until
like midnight last night.

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.455
I did, didn't I?

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:35.750
Yeah, so maybe I'll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.012
Thanks, husband.

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:43.000
Oh, and the bread. It's grilled cheese night.

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:47.000
And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key?

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:50.898
Thank you.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.000
Thank you. That was really nice.

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:00.518
Happy to.

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:04.000
You knew a lot about bathroom law.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It was a short chapter.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:09.000
Thank you.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Oh.

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.000
I'll have your tea waiting for you.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.000
Can't leave my wife.

00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:19.000
Oh.

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:27.000
Okay. That's great. I will see you on the other side.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Hallie, I just met this guy and I don't know, it was something.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, I know it's been a while, but I'm pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But what do I do?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.278
Oh no, this is the time that I'm supposed to be meeting people and doing things.

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.000
Hallie, I gotta call you back.

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.108
God damn it.

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:36.196
Are you okay?

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.000
Big time. I am big time okay.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.895
I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship.

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:54.469
And I didn't want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn't want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.000
Okay.

00:04:57.607 --> 00:05:03.924
And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It's very, very normal.

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:05.000
Yeah.

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.447
Peppermint tea, two sugars.

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:25.672
Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:28.332
Oh.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Hi.

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:41.000
Thank you.

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:44.292
Oh, hey.

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:47.000
You...

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:49.000
So are you going to ask me out now?

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:53.270
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.782
I'm Ben.

00:05:58.807 --> 00:06:00.000
I'm Bea.

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:19.000
So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
No, no. You'd be dead.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.687
You would let me die?

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:25.747
I'm not going to let you die. I'm just going to survive.

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.000
You're right. You're right. You're right.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.628
I was a gymnast.

00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:33.914
Gymnast?

00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.285
Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:39.000
Sixth place?

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:41.209
Yes. Got a ribbon.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:42.250
I'm impressed.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:43.684
Everybody gets a ribbon.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.000
All right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Oh, my God.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.911
If you're going to be a lawyer,
you got to understand negligence

00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:02.377
and breach and McDonald's
versus that lady's habeas corpus.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.373
You used none of those terms properly.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.217
How do you know?
You're not a lawyer yet.

00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:08.327
It's not too late to choose
a more noble profession.

00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:09.516
Oh, like you?

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:13.362
You're right. Stick with it. I'm going to need a lawyer at some point.

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.000
I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer.

00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:20.098
I cannot believe I just said that out loud.

00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:26.855
I'm sorry. My life is a disaster right now.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.434
Might be turning the corner. You just met me.

00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:33.000
Or I might end up in a suitcase.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.174
I mean, look at this place.

00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:37.755
It looks like every serial killer
reenactment documentary.

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:39.232
Why do you have a giant wrench?

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:44.000
Okay, it wouldn't be a suitcase. It'd be a carry-on because you're zero feet tall.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:50.174
And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there's always a way to fix it.

00:07:51.377 --> 00:07:54.114
I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm talking to you about my mom right now.

00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:57.000
Alright. Then tell me about that.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.227
That is a long story. Everybody survived.

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:04.000
Great.

00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:18.009
Holly, I don't know this guy. He's fucking great.

00:09:31.878 --> 00:09:34.863
Yo, let's go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We're gonna be late.

00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:35.962
'Sup, Pete.

00:09:36.882 --> 00:09:38.578
No way. You cooked?

00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.470
That girl you blew me off for stayed over?

00:09:42.298 --> 00:09:47.748
He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking.

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.369
I don't-- I left before you could wake up.

00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:54.000
I don't know why. Why did I?

00:09:55.142 --> 00:09:56.208
What the fuck am I doing?

00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:59.953
Okay, I love you. Bye. I'm so sorry I woke you up. I didn't--

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
This whole thing is so new to me.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Bye.

00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:06.080
You got cheese and bread.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.040
You didn't miss one ingredient.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.424
What you doing with that?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.069
Why you got the giant wrench?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.698
You told her about your mom, bro?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.031
You don't tell nobody about your mom.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.400
Fuck, dog.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.082
You in love, man.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.600
About fucking time, man.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.952
My boy's in love.

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:25.920
Fuck that.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.000
I couldn't get her out of here fast enough.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.120
This girl's a disaster.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080
She's a nothing.

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:47.640
Want to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.000
to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.800
The kids, they call the goonies.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.560
I see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.480
hanging on the wall.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.440
Got your girlfriend screaming all the cops.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.640
Hey.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.440
Hey.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.240
Claudia.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.040
Holly.

00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:13.093
There we go.

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:17.500
Hey, what's up, Glee?

00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:22.176
Ben, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.440
Are we saying that now?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.720
Yeah, is that cool?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.280
Yeah, I mean, I don't really like labels,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.200
but I like you a whole bunch.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.520
I like your friend a whole bunch.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.040
And if she wants to put a label on me,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.240
then she can sew it on wherever she wants.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
That was weird.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.840
That was weird.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.640
I'm not into S&M or anything like that,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.840
unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.080
You do you.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.726
Well, she really likes you, too.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.080
And that is very rare for her.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.778
Oh, look who's talking.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.760
How's the crowd in here tonight?

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.680
Over there, big boy.

00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:55.440
Oh, B.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.600
Ladies like dumplings?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.920
We just had the greatest dumplings.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.080
Pete, meet my sister.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.000
This is Pete, Claudia's brother.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.800
Nice to meet you.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.400
And Ben.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.400
Ben.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.320
This is Ben.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.400
We all grew up together.

00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:11.440
Hey.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.280
Yeah.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.368
You two know each other?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.720
Yeah, we met.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
Barely.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.360
Wow, that's so random.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.880
I'm going to go grab a drink.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.000
Door's that way if you're looking to sneak out.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.440
I know that's your thing.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.360
Well, I am a disaster.

00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:30.360
Let's go away from this.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.720
Yeah.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.960
So you a lawyer yet?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.880
Why?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.400
Do you need a defense attorney?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.720
I'm just curious how you passed the class on ethics

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.800
and not bailing on people.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.160
I think that's the jerk who B got with when she was

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.360
on her break from Jonathan.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.760
No way.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.320
So B's the coffee girl who ghosted him?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.280
I thought she looked familiar, but I don't see faces.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280
I just see souls.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.560
At least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.480
I'm engaged now.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.320
Good for you.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.000
Where are you registered?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.960
I'll buy you a broomstick.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.480
I'll send you an invite.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.600
You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.680
You do remember.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.160
See, it did mean something to you.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.200
You'll always be my rock bottom.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.280
The night I spent with a bitch.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.960
Did she just call him a bitch?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.760
You think they're going to physically fight?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.520
Or fuck?

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.000
That's a fine line.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.040
Let's just get through tonight for them, OK?

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.120
Elle, she's your sister.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.880
I'm sure the relationship won't last long.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.000
She's your friend.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.800
I question why they're even together.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.760
Then I'm going to get a drink and toast to never

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.120
seeing you again.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.760
Cheers to that, bro.

00:13:25.612 --> 00:13:28.593
ANYONE BUT YOU

00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:31.880
So before I pronounce this newlywed couple,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.720
if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.040
joining together in holy matrimony,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.380
speak now or forever hold your peace.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.880
I have an objection.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.000
Leo, don't do this.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.880
I have to, Annie.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.400
It's just not right.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.667
There's no way I can bless this union

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.000
without their friends and family joining us

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.960
to celebrate in Australia.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.376
We're getting married in Sydney.

00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.160
Welcome on board.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
2K to the front.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.480
Thank you, Sheryl.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.560
51E, how long's the flight?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.400
16 hours.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.146
51F, thanks.

00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:21.640
73F, all the way to the back.

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:43.748
Hey.

00:14:44.715 --> 00:14:46.107
Head of the wedding?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.840
Of my sister, yes, I am.

00:14:49.874 --> 00:14:51.880
How crazy is it that we're on the same plane?

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.160
Don't think there's thousands of flights

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.280
flying to Sydney every day.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.480
Oh, there's quite a few, actually.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.640
Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.880
Serendipity, I guess.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.000
I don't think that word means what you think it means.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So where's your fiance?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.880
Wait, is this him?

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.760
Hey, I'm Ben.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.720
I was her hall pass on your break.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.600
What?

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.920
Oh my god, I forgot.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.040
Claude told me you dumped him.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.960
Did you sneak out on your wedding day?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.680
Wow, you are a child.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.480
It's a pretty long flight.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.520
Do you want anything from the front of the boat?

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.200
Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.320
No, thank you.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.400
I'm all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.593
Nothing small about me.

00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:31.535
What the fuck?

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:33.622
Have a good flight.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.680
See you there.

00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:42.200
Why do so many of us feel stuck?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.320
How is it even a very successful?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.680
Often feel like there is something

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.760
missing from their lives.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.080
Why do so many people spend years

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.080
mystically thinking about choices they might have made?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.760
One answer to that problem, many of us

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.560
are leading lives that are misaligned

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.210
with our own deepest values and preferences.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.480
Thank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.720
What psychology can teach us about living

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.240
our most authentic lives?

00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:44.196
What the fuck?

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.160
Hey, Vinny!

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.839
Vindale!

00:17:57.455 --> 00:17:59.634
OK, Vin, looking good.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.680
Thanks for picking me up, dude.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.160
Not just you, my guy.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Spelling Bee!

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
Hey!

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.680
Our sisters are getting married.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680
How dope is that?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680
I know, I'm so excited.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
Oh, great.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.160
All right, let's hit it.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.160
Bye.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160
Y'all ready for Australia?

00:18:27.438 --> 00:18:29.160
Can't wait for y'all to see where we stay.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.580
And the plan is so dope.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
We're all staying at the same place?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
Yep, my stepdad's house.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
Well, that's because they think you guys hate each other,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.584
so they didn't want to poke the beard.

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:13.160
Not bad, right?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
You don't even play tennis.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
I know, but I feel sweet.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
Hey, meet Kalonabee, y'all.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.160
Meet Kalonabee.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160
Hey, meet Kalonabee.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
All over.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.160
All over.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.160
Spin, spin, spin.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160
Woo-hoo!

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160
He was the only member of the family who was trans.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160
Yeah, he was there.

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:40.842
Whoa.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
You're right.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160
This place is insane.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.685
I know.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
All right, let's get some sand under your feet.

00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:54.343
Have you guys made up?

00:19:54.913 --> 00:19:55.344
All good.

00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.160
We're fine if he just stays away from me.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Don't need an invitation for that.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.936
I think you do if you're like this.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.960
You can't leave me alone.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.240
- Same reason I slowed down at the car crash.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.160
- Okay, so you guys buried the hatchet,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.240
water under the bridge, two adults adulting

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.500
like fucking adults.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500
- Oh, we did have a little bit

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.120
of a last minute snafu though.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.200
You guys are gonna have to share a room.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.220
There's only one bed,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.920
but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.260
- She's kidding.

00:20:18.288 --> 00:20:19.530
- You're funny.

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:20.979
I can't wait any longer.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.200
- Wait for me!

00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:27.300
- Hallie's such a goof.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.600
- She's good for you.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.100
She could use some spontaneity.

00:20:31.884 --> 00:20:35.673
Hey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.

00:20:35.698 --> 00:20:36.738
- I hope so.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.120
I have a million contingencies

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.160
and scenarios for everything.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.800
And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.360
because I love the shit out of her

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.800
and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I'm saying?

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.349
- You're such a romantic.

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:53.400
- Hey, don't be mad at me, but Margaret's here.

00:20:54.891 --> 00:20:56.016
- Why would I be mad?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.200
She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.360
- Yeah.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.680
Margaret, Margaret, look who's here.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.840
- There she is.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.385
100%.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.220
- Go rip off the band-aid.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.440
- Babe!

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.480
- How's it going, stranger?

00:21:20.826 --> 00:21:22.480
- I was hoping you'd come.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.320
I wanted to message you,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.520
but I didn't know how you'd feel about hearing from me.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.420
- Are you kidding?

00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:31.280
- I'm never leaving.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.360
Never leave.

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:35.840
How are mom and dad?

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.760
- They're good.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.760
You know, mom now thinks she's Australian

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.240
and dad's not at all pointing out

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.400
every tiny little detail that's different.

00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:44.480
- They're also a little worried

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.200
how you're gonna react to all this.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.560
- What are you talking about?

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.520
- Well, you know, everybody thought

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.280
that you'd be the one getting married first.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.880
You always used to talk about your wedding growing up.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.560
You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.440
when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.800
- Hallie, stop.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.160
That's not me anymore.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.320
I'm free now.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.600
I'm deprogrammed.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.160
That does not mean I don't support you

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.761
and your misguided view that soulmates exist.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.280
- That's sweet.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.600
Is that gonna be your toast?

00:22:10.557 --> 00:22:12.600
- You and Claudia are the exception.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.400
I'm really happy for you, for real.

00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:21.960
- What's going on over there?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.200
- That's Claudia's cousin.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.072
She visited the States a few years back.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.320
They dated.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.160
- No biggie.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.000
- Broke up with him.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.840
- Crushed his heart.

00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:31.800
- No way, that man does not have a heart.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.404
- Feels like forever ago.

00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:36.909
We were babies.

00:22:36.934 --> 00:22:38.534
- I'm really happy you're here.

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:41.871
We can reconnect as maybe not babies.

00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:43.278
- I would love that.

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:46.720
Beau!

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:48.760
Come eat my mate.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.880
Ben, this is my partner, Beau.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.720
- Hi, mate.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.480
- Like, tennis partner?

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.320
- Sometimes after.

00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:00.200
How do you two dags know each other?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.149
- We had a bit of a go back when, didn't we?

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.960
- Did you now?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.917
Good on ya.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.360
Hey, we're gonna go trotting this weekend.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.680
Hit up the turps out here, eh?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.840
It's gonna be a cracker.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
- Woo!

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.216
- You know it.

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.000
- Great guy.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.840
- Yeah.

00:23:38.892 --> 00:23:39.617
- Mommy!

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.040
- Hey, Beatrice.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.400
- Dad! - You made it.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.320
- Oh, baby.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.160
- Hi, baby.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.600
- Hi, honey.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.520
Oh, my God.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.601
- Wow.

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.440
- How's our future lawyer?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.280
- Great.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.200
- Great.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.040
- How's the trip been?

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.600
- Oh, magical.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.960
The Australians are all wonderful.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.440
And excuse me, but good looking.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.884
- Oh.

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.480
- Why are they so weird about their plugs?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.640
I mean, this place is basically America.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.920
They speak English, they eat regular food,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.560
they have a complicated relationship with their past.

00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:12.920
- How are you doing, honey?

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.765
- I'm doing okay.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.040
- I'm doing great.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.907
My big sister's getting married.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.560
Could have been you.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.920
Could still be you someday.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.040
- Have you heard from Jonathan?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.880
Did he call or anything?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.000
- Well, that didn't take long.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.480
- We're just torn up that he's not part

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.560
of our family anymore.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.600
- I mean, he works at our house every night

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.240
from like 11 years old.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.760
He was basically family.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.560
Was about to be actual family.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.920
If I never ask you for anything ever again,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.714
can you please just lay off of me this weekend?

00:24:43.139 --> 00:24:45.680
- I just want both of our daughters to be happy.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.120
- I'm very happy, but not when you guys do this.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.320
- Ned, you in the right direction?

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.160
- He's such a great guy.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.600
- Just think on it, yeah?

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:05.466
- Bee, dinner at 7.30, okay?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.520
- Yeah.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:08.400
Yeah.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.680
- Ben, all set for dinner, yeah?

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.800
- Yeah, I'll be there.

00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.280
- I was plagiarizing.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.120
- Hey!

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.960
- Hi Ben!

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.800
- Hey Ben!

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.640
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.480
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.320
- Everybody?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.200
- Dad's speech.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.040
- Oh yes, right, okay.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440
- We're gonna make this short,

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.880
because you've all traveled a bloody long distance,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.120
and Carol and I are so appreciative.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.000
Biggest thing we've missed since coming back

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.320
from the States is not seeing our kids.

00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:18.916
And you lot, our extended family,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.160
so we're just over the moon to have a full house

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.760
before the wedding on Sunday.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.072
- Where we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.142
setting off on this crazy thing called life.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.680
And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.600
- Well, we're just so grateful,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.080
not only for your incredible hospitality,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.080
but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.294
- So as they say in our country, abondanza.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.226
- Cheers!

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.740
- Now baby.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.398
- Wow!

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.600
- What classes are you loving?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.912
Have you given any more thought to tort law?

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.600
'Cause class action is really where it's at right now.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.520
What does Jonathan say?

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.360
He knows you pretty well.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.600
What does he think you should do?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.440
- Mom.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.280
- Okay.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.000
- I can't even remember why we put you in the truck again.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.040
- We didn't put her in the trunk,

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.200
she stowed away in the trunk.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.360
- Yeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.760
- We were going to Coachella.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.960
- I know that now, it was nice.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.520
- All right, everyone.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.426
So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.920
Let's just have a moment to calm ourselves.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.680
I am not looking at anybody in particular,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.680
but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.280
Crown chakra.

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:56.301
Let's hit that cobra.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.240
Cleanse, get that weasel.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.080
- Okay.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.920
- Go!

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.034
- You go, you go.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.000
- Sign of the times.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.920
- All right, all right, four words.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.240
- First word, the, A, of, if.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.280
- Animosity, hate, liar.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.120
Five words.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.080
- No, just shut the fuck up.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.280
- The Bible.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.080
- A woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.000
to take advantage of other people.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.320
- Mom, focus, okay?

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.160
Right here, right here.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.320
- This is a white people's game.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.240
Y'all spend so much time trying to trick each other.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.600
Y'all got so much time on your hands.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.680
Just say the word.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
- It's on the extreme.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.520
- Grumpy old man.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.360
- Hi.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.200
- Hi.

00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:35.524
- Okay, okay, yeah, okay.

00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:37.520
- Fuck boy.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.640
- Old cat woman.

00:28:40.449 --> 00:28:41.480
- Your ego.

00:28:42.924 --> 00:28:43.640
- Okay.

00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:47.560
- What is this?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.400
- Wait, no props.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.800
- No one cares, no one can see us.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.720
- Cheaters are shocking.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.280
- Says the woman who cheated on her fiance.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.600
- We were on a break, asshole.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.776
- You're either broken up for good, or you're cheating.

00:28:56.076 --> 00:28:57.642
Either way, someone's lying to someone.

00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:58.640
- I must have really gotten under your skin.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.520
- Roger, what is this?

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.360
- Fat, five.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.676
- What is the thing I'm holding in my hand?

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:04.351
- Fireworks.

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:05.440
- Fireworks by Katy Perry.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280
- Hey.

00:29:07.188 --> 00:29:08.263
- That is not fair.

00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:09.280
- Hey, what, you're not fair.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280
- What's wrong with you?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.440
- Just stop.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.280
- What are you doing?

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.120
- What is wrong with you?

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.960
- Stop.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.800
- Oh God.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.200
- Oh God.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.040
- Sam, what the?

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040
- Oh my God.

00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:22.080
- Ali.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.360
- Get back.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.200
- Sam.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.040
- Roger.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.360
- I've got this.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.792
- That's some gangster shit right there.

00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:38.400
- Sorry.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.240
- Sorry.

00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:43.640
- They're going to ruin our wedding.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.640
All that matters is that we're together.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640
- It's true.

00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.440
- Look baby, I love you to the moon and back,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.680
but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.760
and our memories, which we are going to have

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.520
for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.975
- It's going to be fine baby, we just have to.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.160
to stand there and profess our love.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.580
- It seems to me, their animus only surfaced

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.680
after they spent a night together.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680
Am I accurate?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.120
- That's usually how it goes, honey.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.800
We crumple our feelings into a ball

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.280
and shove 'em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.720
- The solution appears to be simple then.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.880
We return them to the night they were spent.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.320
- Like we trick them into falling in love with each other?

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.160
- He didn't say anything about love, honey.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.760
We just need to get them to jump each other's bones.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.300
- Yeah, come on!

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.880
That was good, right?

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.040
That was good.

00:31:42.963 --> 00:31:45.880
- You go, you go, you go, you go, you go.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.560
- She clearly has eyes for men.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.760
- Who does, father?

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.200
- Hallie Spence, the sister.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.520
The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.720
- You can't say that.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.760
- What the hell?

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760
No, that was rude.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.040
I apologize to anyone that was listening,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.040
which can only be you, Pete,

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.880
'cause you're the only person that was listening.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.840
I apologize.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.320
- I accept your apology and will now move on.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.880
Do you know Bea's been in love with Ben

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.600
since the first night they met?

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.240
- Well, why didn't she tell him?

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.480
You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl,

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.560
I would sneak up behind her and I'd cut a lock of her hair

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.360
and then I'd smack her on the bum!

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.200
- What the hell?

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.560
- I don't know, I'm not good at this, sorry.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.280
- Bea was just too scared to tell him,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.920
but I've talked to her and she says she regrets

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.200
walking out that morning.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.400
- Tell me more, son.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.240
- Why me?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.760
- Because you're really good at it, right?

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.600
You can do it.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.440
- Why me, why?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280
- Why you put this hat on me?

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.000
No one can see me, it's a radio play, motherfucker.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
- Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.920
so he lets his guard down and goes to her.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.760
Some Cupid's killed with arrows and some with traps.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.720
- That was good, I like that, that's good.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.560
- I just made it up.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.280
- So, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.080
and say, "Come to Papa."

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080
- What are you doing?

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.680
- I'm from a different generation.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.720
- And your generation sucks.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.040
You fucked up the whole world for us.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.920
- And I'm full of shame.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.160
But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.

00:32:57.751 --> 00:33:01.240
- But Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.800
I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.680
- Then why is he fighting with her?

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.480
- Well, because he likes her.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.400
- And I know that Bea likes Ben.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.560
She's just denying herself because she's got in her head

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.800
somehow that she'll never love again.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.960
- Whoa, I'm not talking about love, baby.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.720
I'm talking about dick.

00:33:17.466 --> 00:33:18.560
- Oh, it's Ben.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.400
- Oh.

00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.160
- Hey.

00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.000
- You.

00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:37.760
- Oh God, they got to you too?

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.600
- What?

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.960
- Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.120
say how much I like you?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.917
- No.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.225
- Really?

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.720
- It was Pete and Roger.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.480
- Fantastic, it's a team effort.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.880
They're trying to get us together.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.320
- No way.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.160
- Come here.

00:34:04.223 --> 00:34:06.560
- Oh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.640
so we don't ruin the biggest event of their lives.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640
- Us?

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.840
There is no us and assholes.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.600
You're the one who destroyed the living room.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.800
- Would you two mind helping me with something?

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.393
- I hate to ask, but I'd really appreciate it.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.760
- Sure.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.600
- Yeah.

00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:32.680
- So Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.800
I swear, if his head wasn't screwed on,

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.200
we'd use it as a bowling ball.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.880
Do me a favor and swim out and get them.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.400
It's the one on the right.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.240
- Both of us.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.800
- Is that really a two person job?

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.240
- Doesn't seem like it.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.080
- You two.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.360
- Yeah.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.760
- All right, so everyone's involved in this.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.600
- I know.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.173
- I feel bad.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.040
- Me too.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.960
- I don't want to bum Holly and Claudia out.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.773
- Just me and you.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.160
- Can you not swim?

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.240
- I'm an excellent swimmer.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.600
- Why are you so out of breath?

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.440
- I'm fine.

00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:13.520
How much further do you think?

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.960
- Are your eyes closed?

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.480
- I think it's dark.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.840
- Why are you so out of shape?

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.960
You have like a 10 pop.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.920
- I'm not out of shape.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.120
I've been to 295, 300 once.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.400
I just don't do cardio.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.708
- Oh my God, you're hot girl fit.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.160
- I'm not hot girl fit.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.698
- Okay, my bad.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.554
We'll see you at the boat.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.800
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:35:57.779 --> 00:36:01.560
- I could have done it myself, but whatever.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.400
Thanks.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.960
- No fucking way.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.600
- Honey, look who's here.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.040
- I cannot believe they did this.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.880
- Who is that?

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.360
- That is my ex, Jonathan.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.200
- Hey, hey.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.120
- What is he doing here?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.000
- My Black Hawk helicopter parents

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.400
have been trying to get us back together

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.680
for the past four months.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.400
- They flew him halfway across the world

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.720
to your sister's wedding?

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.760
That's some deep off shit.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.897
They came to play.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.320
- That's my parents.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.480
They think I'm throwing my life away.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.240
- Honey, we're just gonna take him back

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.840
and get him all settled in.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.880
- I'll see you later.

00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.880
- You know, maybe we should do it.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.480
Just tell everyone we're together.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.320
- What?

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.400
- It would solve that problem for me

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.680
and that problem for you.

00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:51.440
- I don't have a problem.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.040
- You clearly want Margaret.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.880
- No, I don't.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.720
- Yes, you do.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.120
I saw the way you looked at her last night

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.760
and I know she broke your heart.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.280
She sees you're with me.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.560
She wants what she can't have

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.680
and then bye bye crocodile Jack.

00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:06.920
Fuck, he's fast.

00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:09.440
- Making her jealous is not gonna work.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.680
We're not in seventh grade.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.800
- Trust me, bro.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.123
We're all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.880
They've already gone through all of the bullshit

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.680
trying to trick us into each other's arms.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.000
Let's just embrace it.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.640
- There's no way we can convince anyone

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.040
we actually like each other.

00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:27.480
- Yeah, you're right.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.320
- I know.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.200
You know, I still think about that night we spent together.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.040
- Shut up.

00:37:37.077 --> 00:37:38.280
- No, I'm serious.

00:37:40.184 --> 00:37:42.080
You know, this could be kind of fun.

00:37:43.003 --> 00:37:46.560
We're at a wedding a million miles away from home.

00:37:48.081 --> 00:37:50.928
Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade.

00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:56.080
And that night at your place,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.560
no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing.

00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:08.480
Convincing enough?

00:38:12.168 --> 00:38:12.827
- Fuck it.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.480
Let's do it.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440
- Just wait.

00:38:23.253 --> 00:38:24.160
Wait.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.960
- Okay, okay.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.600
Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.760
We're running behind schedule.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.600
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.240
Babe, the mountains have been there for millions of years.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.240
A few more minutes isn't gonna hurt them.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.080
- Baby, I know you are trying to calm me down

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.000
and I love you for it.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.840
Thank you.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.120
But I am hurting cats right now

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.960
and I need some help

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.120
instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.080
- Aw, jitters.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.680
Remember our wedding?

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.600
Only that you're the most beautiful bride

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.760
on God's green earth.

00:38:58.692 --> 00:38:59.960
- Right answer.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.840
We're coming, we're coming, we're coming.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.120
Jinx, you owe me a cup.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.400
Oh, you have a little something in your teeth.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.240
- Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.840
- Yeah, let me just take that out.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.040
Oh, I gotta get it out.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:10.880
Oh, it's right there.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.480
- Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.153
- Honey, here he is.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.760
- Hey.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.480
- Jonathan.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.600
- So nice to see you.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.280
- I had no idea you were coming.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.720
- So your parents didn't tell you, okay?

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.880
Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.440
when they invited me was, "Does B know?"

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.003
'Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.280
And now it is fucking awkward.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.840
- No, no, not at all.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.680
- I'm in a lot of love.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.520
- No, you're like family.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.840
It'd be effing awkward if you weren't here.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.960
- I'm so glad you're here.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.360
- I'm so happy for you two.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.360
Hey, congratulations.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.200
- Yeah, thanks.

00:39:43.158 --> 00:39:44.400
- Right?

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.339
- It's great to see you.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.520
- It's great to see you too.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.680
- We're all going on a hike,

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.120
so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.640
Let's move out.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.726
- Ben, meet Jonathan.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.560
- Oh, hey, man.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.400
I'm Ben.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.040
- Hey, oh, Pete and Claudia's friend, right?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.909
Also friends with Bea, among other things.

00:40:09.752 --> 00:40:11.000
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.741
Okay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is.

00:40:14.766 --> 00:40:16.000
Come on, let's go!

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:19.000
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
We need to come up with a game plan.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Yeah, you are so terrible at this.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
What?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.000
We're doing this thing!

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.

00:40:31.727 --> 00:40:34.000
Oh, it's totally fine. I'm glad he's here.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
I love him and Holly loves him.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Really?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.438
Great, okay. So we're spending a little time together away from the real world

00:40:41.463 --> 00:40:44.000
and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Oh, no, Mom, guys, no.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.413
I totally forgot to tell you, but I'm with Ben.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.351
Do you want to come?

00:40:57.874 --> 00:41:00.301
I think I'm going to hang back and yell at your parents.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Have fun.

00:41:12.163 --> 00:41:15.629
Alright, so is it like we just got together or we've been sneaking around?

00:41:15.654 --> 00:41:18.621
Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle,

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:20.000
lady in the tramp, the burrito?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.565
No.

00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:23.000
This can't be that hard.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
It's harder than you think. My parents don't even believe it yet.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You told them five seconds ago.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
They know I would never go out with a guy like you.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.210
You've been with one guy your entire life.

00:41:31.668 --> 00:41:33.556
Jonathan's a better man than you'll ever be.

00:41:33.581 --> 00:41:35.000
And yet you left him.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.749
Okay, you don't know my boxes and you never will.

00:41:40.241 --> 00:41:42.000
Just figure this out, please.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Okay.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.000
We just suck face in front of everybody.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Half of them think they set us up anyway.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
No, that's too much. We need to do something that's more hidden

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.760
You're calling me a fuckboy like it's an insult?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
I own that shit.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Let's just be affectionate.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.266
I know it's a foreign concept for you.

00:42:01.374 --> 00:42:03.000
I can be affectionate.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I'll affectionate the shit out of you.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I can't believe your parents invited Jonathan.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Now I have to find a table to sit him at.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
What about Bea?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
No, no, she's fine. She's sitting with us at our table.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
No, I'm talking about how she's already at a low point because she's going through a breakup

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.584
and I don't even know what's happening with school.

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:19.000
She never even talks about it anymore.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I guess I could put up with the cousins.

00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:22.178
Why?

00:42:25.028 --> 00:42:25.603
You alright?

00:42:27.694 --> 00:42:29.000
Oh, shit.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Wow.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Check it out, guys!

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Nice!

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Yeah!

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Beautiful!

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
See, I told you it was going to be good.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Man, that's nice.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Oh, wow.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Wow.

00:42:40.428 --> 00:42:41.000
So beautiful.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
There it is.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Feel the serenity.

00:42:43.444 --> 00:42:44.636
Pretty spectacular, hey?

00:42:45.944 --> 00:42:47.000
It's amazing.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Alright, your turn.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.000
Wow.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
This is just so romantic.

00:42:57.102 --> 00:42:58.000
Okay, nuzzle my neck.

00:42:58.682 --> 00:42:59.185
Okay.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.000
Get in there.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Damn, you are short.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
You are not tall enough to say that.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Oh.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Oh, are you ticklish?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.416
No, I'm acting.

00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:10.608
Like a toddler?

00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:12.000
No, go away.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Okay, I can use that.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Beg me.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Beg me to stuff you in the butt.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.073
Stop!

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Just let me do it.

00:43:18.843 --> 00:43:21.000
Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.

00:43:22.135 --> 00:43:23.000
Granted.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Too hard.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Sorry.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
You gotta sell it.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Okay, not in circles.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
It's not a magic lamp.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
What?

00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:47.463
Okay, now you're just playing bop it.

00:43:47.578 --> 00:43:49.000
I've never rubbed a bopper show.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.693
Clearly, you've tried.

00:43:54.893 --> 00:43:56.000
Are you not wearing underwear?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
It's a swimsuit.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I'm on holiday.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.457
Oh.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Okay, just mind the gap.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
How's that?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
That's good.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Just like, but you don't have to hover.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Just kind of, oh, man the woods.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.263
I'm sorry.

00:44:07.288 --> 00:44:08.181
Okay, just take it out.

00:44:12.964 --> 00:44:14.000
You try.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
You want me to stick my finger in my own ass?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
How's that gonna convince?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Oh, on you.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I can't.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Jesus Christ, it's like a vacuum pack down here.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
How'd you get in this thing?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Oh, man, it's tight.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Oh, see, it's like holding a baby bird.

00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:31.301
God damn it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.769
Were they not watching this whole time?

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
You like a mole or something on your butt?

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
No.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Really? 'Cause I feel something.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I don't have a mole.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
What the fuck?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
What the fuck?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
What the fuck?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
What the fuck?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
What the fuck?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Are there any more on me?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
I don't know.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Jack, spiders hunt bears.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
They hunt bears.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.000
No pictures.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Put the cameras down.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
We're not gonna take a spirit.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Are there any more?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I don't know.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Where are they?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I feel it.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
I feel it.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I think I see something.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
What do you see?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
What do you see?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Oh, no, that's just a part of you.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You're fine.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.609
All right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me,

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:19.634
they might be in you.

00:45:22.476 --> 00:45:23.241
I'm good.

00:45:24.613 --> 00:45:26.000
That's probably a better way to check than what I did.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Yeah.

00:45:32.889 --> 00:45:36.000
All right, little one, we join your journey.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
We do not inherit the earth.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.139
We just borrow it from our creatures.

00:45:42.463 --> 00:45:43.463
Hey, guys.

00:45:43.488 --> 00:45:44.444
What did we miss?

00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:47.765
Wow.

00:45:57.368 --> 00:45:58.626
Why can't I get this?

00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:01.496
Because you're meant to learn to dive when you're six.

00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:04.676
You got this, hon.

00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.805
You ever try focusing on your toes?

00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.508
My mom taught me this trick.

00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:11.000
If you pretend like there's a string from your nose to your toes,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.554
you just kind of maintain that position.

00:46:13.715 --> 00:46:14.813
You mind doing it again?

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.838
This time I'm going to shout out a tribute question.

00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:18.461
I think it's just going to help clear your mind.

00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:20.860
Just make sure it's a question about airplanes

00:46:20.896 --> 00:46:24.000
or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.089
Okay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?

00:46:30.339 --> 00:46:33.000
A collaboration between British Airways and the French government.

00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:34.887
How'd I do?

00:46:35.612 --> 00:46:36.659
You're good there.

00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:40.000
Maybe your mom can teach him how to dive.

00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.268
She passed away.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Yeah, sorry.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
All right, I'm going to go again,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.278
but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.

00:46:50.859 --> 00:46:52.000
I have a better idea.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.476
You just let me do everything, I'll guide you in.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.189
Don't think.

00:46:57.732 --> 00:46:59.000
Be careful of his shoulder.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Yeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.425
Wouldn't let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.

00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:06.000
I had to tell her I love her.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
When you know she's the one, nothing else matters.

00:47:18.298 --> 00:47:21.119
I'm waving, thank you, thank you.

00:47:21.729 --> 00:47:23.000
There you go.

00:47:24.583 --> 00:47:25.373
Did I do it?

00:47:25.716 --> 00:47:26.000
Yeah.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Yeah.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.325
Good job, babe.

00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:30.000
Your dad's a natural.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.595
I'm so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.

00:47:32.776 --> 00:47:36.215
Are you two really getting to know each other in a very respectful manner?

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.000
One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.317
Yes, we are in the early stages.

00:47:41.342 --> 00:47:42.193
Not too early.

00:47:42.218 --> 00:47:43.812
But also not so advanced.

00:47:43.837 --> 00:47:47.789
Just that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.

00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:50.343
That's why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up.

00:47:50.562 --> 00:47:52.000
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.873
But our love is just so strong.

00:47:58.235 --> 00:47:59.818
And I know what you guys are thinking.

00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:02.000
He's much older.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.590
They weren't, right?

00:48:04.346 --> 00:48:07.628
Probably thinking I'm 27, early 28s.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.473
Yes, we are very happy.

00:48:11.498 --> 00:48:12.498
Happiest.

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:13.523
Yep.

00:48:18.008 --> 00:48:20.000
You know, you looked like that back in the day.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
No, I didn't.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
That guy's made out of cobblestone.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.000
They're holding hands.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I think it's working.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
I can't believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.

00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:35.000
Was that bullshit about your mom?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
What?

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
The story about the giant wrench.

00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:41.000
I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.

00:48:43.363 --> 00:48:45.000
You ever heard that too?

00:48:47.337 --> 00:48:49.000
Like, I didn't mean...

00:48:52.946 --> 00:48:54.000
I'm sorry.

00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:57.000
And it wasn't a lie.

00:48:59.466 --> 00:49:01.466
Thanks for being so nice to my dad.

00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.527
You should probably rinse off.

00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:09.971
You have his SPF a billion on you now.

00:49:18.135 --> 00:49:19.305
Cheers, mate. I'll just grab a quickie.

00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:20.924
Okay.

00:49:25.194 --> 00:49:26.735
So, Australia.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.976
What do you reckon, eh?

00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:29.001
How you finding it?

00:49:29.026 --> 00:49:30.697
I don't know. It's great.

00:49:30.722 --> 00:49:32.214
Maz goes on about you all the time.

00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:33.975
Ripper Cunt, she calls you.

00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:37.000
Maz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is...

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Good friend.

00:49:39.616 --> 00:49:40.911
Oh, yeah.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.748
You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker.

00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:46.541
And your gobbler, too.

00:49:47.167 --> 00:49:48.000
Gobbler is...

00:49:48.727 --> 00:49:49.990
You know, your hog bonnet.

00:49:51.237 --> 00:49:52.227
You know, your beef cap.

00:49:53.637 --> 00:49:55.637
Come on, mate. You know, the anteater.

00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:00.498
Anyway, good to have ya.

00:50:01.028 --> 00:50:01.868
- Gotcha.

00:50:05.373 --> 00:50:06.375
- G'day, love.

00:50:10.067 --> 00:50:11.680
- Hey, mate.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.280
Fancy a game?

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280
- You're going down.

00:50:18.064 --> 00:50:19.760
How have you been doing?

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760
- Pretty good.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.320
You?

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.354
- Okay, I guess.

00:50:23.379 --> 00:50:24.859
- How's school going?

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.320
Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.280
- You know me.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.880
I've never been one for practicing.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.320
- Still having second thoughts?

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.320
- Straight to third.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.680
- I know it's weird, me being here,

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.360
but believe me, I had nothing to do with it.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.320
Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.680
- That's sweet.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.980
You're part of the family.

00:50:46.175 --> 00:50:49.060
- I'd be lying if I said I haven't been thinking about you.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.160
- Yeah, me too.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.080
- How long have you and that guy, Ben, been?

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.920
- It's kind of new.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.880
Not like new, new, but newish.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.480
- Well, I think he seems great.

00:51:07.075 --> 00:51:08.600
- No, you don't.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.923
- I really don't.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.280
- Thanks for being so cool about all of this.

00:51:16.184 --> 00:51:20.200
Not just this, but this too.

00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:24.320
- It's really good to see you, Bea.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.480
- I'm glad you're here.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.120
- Now let's have fun.

00:51:29.184 --> 00:51:30.040
- Let's do it.

00:51:44.705 --> 00:51:45.840
- Mate.

00:51:46.889 --> 00:51:48.400
- That's me.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.000
- You want a coffee?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.640
It's the best in the world.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.040
- You guys are really proud of your coffee here.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.975
- It's the best in the fucking world.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.840
- Okay.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.160
Enjoy.

00:52:03.062 --> 00:52:04.120
- Fuck, that is good.

00:52:05.097 --> 00:52:07.440
- I was thinking of going for a bit of a run later.

00:52:08.554 --> 00:52:09.600
Do you want to join?

00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:13.440
- I'm actually going on a bike ride with Bea,

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.000
so I don't think I can.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.080
- She's a little sweet on you, hey?

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.200
- Oh, you caught that.

00:52:19.479 --> 00:52:21.720
How long have you and Beau been together?

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.160
- Nah, we're just banging about.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.800
He's nice, but I think I'm looking

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.560
for someone less casual.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.440
More romantic.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.280
- Wow.

00:52:31.612 --> 00:52:33.760
- Why did me and you ever break up anyway?

00:52:34.966 --> 00:52:35.960
- I don't really remember,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.680
but I think you said something like

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.302
I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.

00:52:46.149 --> 00:52:49.000
- Smells like you're not that guy anymore.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.960
Bea's a lucky girl.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.800
- Oh.

00:53:05.817 --> 00:53:07.236
- Hey, open the door.

00:53:07.655 --> 00:53:08.720
Bea.

00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:11.720
- What's wrong?

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.120
- Margaret thinks we're together.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.040
- That's great.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.560
- No, Margaret needs to think

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.840
we're the right type of together.

00:53:17.002 --> 00:53:19.120
Not together together, but like situationally together.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.440
'Cause if she thinks we're together together,

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.800
she's not gonna break girl code.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.800
So we need to finesse our togetherness

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.960
so that we're together,

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.680
but there's an opening for our togetherness

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.200
and she can just slide right in

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.280
so that we can be together.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.360
- Are you on Coke?

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.200
- No, it's like coffee here.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.160
It's like meth.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.480
I'm guessing.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.400
No, I'm not.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.440
I worked at Goldman.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.320
Partner's wedding.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.280
Do what you do.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.040
- Jesus, dude, who are you?

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.880
- I'm a man trying to figure this out.

00:53:41.915 --> 00:53:43.400
Look at your room, it's so much bigger.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.720
You got a painting?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.480
Wow, that's so red.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.920
We have to kick it up a notch.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.480
Make it feel like we're in the Gaga stage.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.160
- What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.240
- That is not Gaga.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.080
Actually, that could be construed as Gaga.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.080
Tonight's the rehearsal dinner,

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:56.920
so we have to do something

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920
that makes it look like you're into me,

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.160
but you're not into me.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.000
And I'm into you,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.202
but you can tell by my face that it's never gonna mount.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.000
- Get it together, man.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.600
- You hit me so much.

00:54:09.942 --> 00:54:10.840
- Okay, Kalana,

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.640
now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden.

00:54:15.945 --> 00:54:16.960
Fuck it up.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.560
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.040
Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.880
Fuck it up.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.720
Ooh.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.840
You see that?

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.000
He did it, yeah.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.320
Oh, hey, they're here.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.960
All right, everybody, wheels up.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.800
- Hustle up.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.640
- Bad dog.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.480
- You look cute.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.480
- Baby, you look so good.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.480
- She's has been.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.560
- You look so good.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.880
- Yeah, I look bad.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.200
- Man, this is the best time to say that.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.520
- Daddy's a dad.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.120
- Come on, let's go.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:42.960
- Yeah.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.000
- All right, let's do it.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.800
- Thank you.

00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:09.440
- You see the size of that boat?

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.520
- Hey, guys.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.360
- Woo!

00:55:20.876 --> 00:55:22.360
- Nice touch.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.200
- Nice dress.

00:55:23.915 --> 00:55:26.160
- You have a good heart.

00:55:55.843 --> 00:55:56.480
- I love this dress.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.320
- You look fine.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.160
- Oh, thank you.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.440
- What would you like to drink?

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.000
- What's a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.080
- Three scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.280
- Oh, thank you.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.680
- All right.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.800
- You remembered.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.925
- That you can't handle hard liquor?

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.640
Yeah, the smell's still not out of my car.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.600
- You know I feel really bad about that.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.520
- That was a fun night.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.760
That was a fun summer.

00:56:19.848 --> 00:56:20.760
- Marks!

00:56:22.767 --> 00:56:25.800
Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.600
- Oh, okay, I'm coming.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.960
Hang on, I've got heels on.

00:56:30.184 --> 00:56:31.520
- Look how lucky we are.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.960
On a boat sailing back and forth

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.720
with no real transportation or reason.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.760
- Okay.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.560
- And look at you, Polly Pocket.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.840
You the belle of the boat.

00:56:45.248 --> 00:56:47.360
- He didn't remember me.

00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:50.867
- Oh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?

00:56:50.892 --> 00:56:54.680
- No, honey, that's, yes, I think it might be.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.560
Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.760
- There it is.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.160
- Well, at least that was subtle.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.244
- Was it?

00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:03.720
- This oddly reminds me of prom.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.720
- The first or second time?

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.560
- Jonathan is just the most perfect guy.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.440
He's like a son to us.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.840
- Well, that might be a problem, mate.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.920
They might not wanna shag a brother.

00:57:37.175 --> 00:57:38.240
- So how's it going?

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.680
- Can parents back off a little?

00:57:42.777 --> 00:57:44.077
- How about you?

00:57:50.364 --> 00:57:51.600
- Game on.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.680
- Can you even dance?

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.840
- You just let me lead.

00:57:54.758 --> 00:57:55.600
- Oh, God.

00:58:05.073 --> 00:58:05.960
- Let's go.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.240
- Is Margaret watching?

00:58:47.167 --> 00:58:48.120
- It's a little hard to tell

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.360
what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.760
- Everybody to the top deck,

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.320
we about to do a champagne toast.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.160
- I'm with you.

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.320
- So what are we doing?

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.320
- Closing the deal.

00:59:11.223 --> 00:59:12.496
- Titanic me.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.560
- What?

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.360
- Oh, help yourself to some champagne.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.200
- Oh, thank you.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.320
- Grab some drinks.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.160
- Oh, great.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.080
- Nice.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:19.920
- Titanic me.

00:59:21.383 --> 00:59:23.280
- No, that is so lame.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.720
- Exactly.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.920
The only people who would do something this lame

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.920
are the ones who know how lame it is,

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.600
but are in the first stages of liking each other,

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.160
so they're totally comfortable in their mutual lameness.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.680
Toast me.

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.680
- Oh my God.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.520
- Come on.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.480
- This is so cringe.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.960
- So is saying cringe, old man.

00:59:50.135 --> 00:59:51.280
- Lift my arms.

00:59:52.118 --> 00:59:53.360
- I've seen the movie.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.200
- Have you?

00:59:58.232 --> 00:59:59.400
- Okay.

01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:02.000
This is never gonna work.

01:00:03.945 --> 01:00:07.545
Aww! That is the cutest thing I've ever seen!

01:00:07.573 --> 01:00:09.000
Are they doing Titanic?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Aww!

01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:15.914
Are they watching?

01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:19.000
Yep.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Are they buying it?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Can't imagine they would.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.000
It's real. We did it.

01:00:25.733 --> 01:00:28.271
We're good. We're really bloody good.

01:00:29.771 --> 01:00:31.771
Jonathan, have you seen Tasmania?

01:00:32.137 --> 01:00:34.000
Inya, I'm fine. It's fine.

01:00:44.635 --> 01:00:45.740
Can I do the line?

01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:50.253
That's king of the world. You're king of the world.

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.427
Jack, I'm flying!

01:00:54.452 --> 01:00:55.000
Okay, we can stop there.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
We can stop there.

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:09.000
They're gone. Show's over.

01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:13.667
Oh my god!

01:01:18.982 --> 01:01:21.000
No! Wait for me! Help! Wait!

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Wait!

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Bae!

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Bea!

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Are you okay?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yeah.

01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.511
Why'd you jump in?

01:01:43.536 --> 01:01:44.536
To save you!

01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:45.950
But you're a terrible swimmer!

01:01:45.975 --> 01:01:48.975
I'm a great swimmer! Just short distances.

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.461
We're gonna die.

01:01:54.486 --> 01:01:55.486
We're not gonna die.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.151
We're gonna get hypothermia.

01:01:57.176 --> 01:01:58.176
The water's 90 degrees.

01:01:58.201 --> 01:01:59.631
We're gonna get eaten by sharks.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.970
Fuck! We're gonna get eaten by sharks!

01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:07.181
We are gonna be fine.

01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:10.206
And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.

01:02:10.577 --> 01:02:11.577
Goldman?

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:13.028
Yeah, it was a partner's kids bar mitzvah.

01:02:13.053 --> 01:02:14.241
A little bit of crack.

01:02:18.296 --> 01:02:19.296
Oh my god!

01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:20.167
Roger!

01:02:20.192 --> 01:02:21.192
Oh my god!

01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:22.887
It looks like they're going full Titanic.

01:02:22.912 --> 01:02:24.381
I love the commitment!

01:02:24.406 --> 01:02:25.406
Stop the boat!

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:26.431
No, no, no.

01:02:26.456 --> 01:02:27.456
Help!

01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:28.481
They're coming!

01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:29.506
Stay calm!

01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:30.124
This is not a very good swim.

01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:30.818
Bei!

01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:38.776
There.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:41.707
Are you sure?

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:42.975
Yeah.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Come on.

01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:51.000
Why aren't we turning the boat around?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
We are in too shallow of water.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
We'll run aground.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But harbour rescue has been notified.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Come on.

01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:17.000
Are you good?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Mm-hmm.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Okay.

01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:26.000
All right.

01:03:26.914 --> 01:03:27.914
Okay.

01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:29.000
Let's go.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
All right, get in the row.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Okay.

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:37.465
That was, um, probably the most--

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.000
I mean, if you didn't close it with Margaret, I don't--

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.560
There's nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.

01:03:44.732 --> 01:03:47.000
Yeah, well, Jonathan didn't do it, that's for sure.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Your parents half the clock, that's shit.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You didn't even give him a chance.

01:03:51.943 --> 01:03:54.000
Why do you keep defending this guy?

01:03:54.711 --> 01:03:56.722
Why do you break up with him in the first place?

01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:57.747
It's complicated.

01:03:57.772 --> 01:03:58.772
It's never complicated.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.000
What, he cheated on you?

01:04:00.143 --> 01:04:01.355
Drug problem?

01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:04.000
Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?

01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:08.000
We never fought.

01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:10.000
Isn't that a good thing?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It was just comfortable.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.797
And he's a great guy, which means there's no one out there for me

01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:16.000
because I had the best one.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I couldn't even tell him I quit law school.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life.

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:27.000
We're gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
No one else knows?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.

01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:34.000
You finally did it.

01:04:34.612 --> 01:04:35.000
What?

01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:40.000
You know, one night you said you didn't want to be a lawyer anyways.

01:04:40.847 --> 01:04:42.000
You remember that?

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:47.000
It was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course.

01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:51.000
Why did you?

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:56.000
Because you scared the shit out of me.

01:04:58.096 --> 01:05:02.000
It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.000
I know a little bit about that.

01:05:09.714 --> 01:05:11.600
I was really hurt when you left.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:15.000
So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete.

01:05:15.516 --> 01:05:17.000
That's not how I felt.

01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.000
Look at us.

01:05:25.823 --> 01:05:30.000
Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor.

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:35.000
Promise me if we make it out alive we'll go see that from dry land.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It's a pretty killer view from here.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It's dumb but I want to see the people.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Landmarks like those are full of people in love.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.

01:05:50.793 --> 01:05:53.000
Like your dad in the Eiffel Tower?

01:05:54.485 --> 01:05:56.000
He told you that?

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:59.000
Nothing else matters when it comes to love.

01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:03.000
You could use a bit of that right now.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:06.000
It's not dumb.

01:06:07.719 --> 01:06:09.000
You, me and the opera house.

01:06:09.847 --> 01:06:10.847
It's a date.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:12.000
I promise.

01:07:09.656 --> 01:07:11.000
What's wrong?

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:14.000
I'm a little afraid of flying.

01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:16.561
Don't you fly all the time for your job?

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:19.321
I have a very specific routine.

01:07:19.864 --> 01:07:23.305
I mask, headphones, build my bubble.

01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:37.000
That's my Serenity song.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.393
How do you know my Serenity song?

01:07:39.418 --> 01:07:40.418
Don't worry about it.

01:08:20.929 --> 01:08:22.000
You all good?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.005
Shut the fuck up now!

01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:08.000
Thanks again.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.278
Stay out of the water, yeah?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Want some coffee?

01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:15.000
Not the stuff from here. I'll be up all night.

01:09:16.195 --> 01:09:16.885
Yeah.

01:09:17.682 --> 01:09:19.000
Thanks for kind of saving me though.

01:09:20.158 --> 01:09:21.000
It was fun.

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:23.000
Stupid, but fun.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Well, that's the best kind.

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.000
No, no, no, it's hot!

01:09:38.373 --> 01:09:39.000
I'm warm.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
When are you ever gonna learn?

01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:45.000
Like, you want me to blow on it?

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.000
Is it still hot?

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.908
- We're getting pretty good at faking it.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:47.000
- I don't even know what's real anymore.

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.374
Everything I do just feels like a mistake.

01:12:01.694 --> 01:12:04.694
- Ben, Steve, are you guys all right?

01:12:06.975 --> 01:12:08.975
- Ben, wait, you hear?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
- I can't hear you.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
- Steve!

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Beatrice!

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Beatrice!

01:12:42.505 --> 01:12:45.000
- Honey, what are these? Is that a handprint?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
- No.

01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:46.169
- Come on, baby gorgeous.

01:13:46.194 --> 01:13:48.000
We got chores. Come on, let's go.

01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:51.011
Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.

01:13:51.352 --> 01:13:52.670
- Dude, I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:54.061
- Man, I hope you scrub from top to bottom,

01:13:54.086 --> 01:13:55.086
'cause who knows what was in that heart rate.

01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:57.111
- I also showered last night.

01:13:57.136 --> 01:13:59.136
- Two showers in eight hours?

01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.855
Go off, King, get clean!

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:16.014
- Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:18.847
- Yes, I'm so excited to marry Claudia.

01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.665
But, you know, I'm also hosting a party

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.531
where it feels like we're all playing parts in a play,

01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:23.974
and I'm not really into the pageantry,

01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:25.732
and I kinda just wanna do a little--

01:14:26.559 --> 01:14:28.724
- All that matters is that you and Claudia

01:14:28.749 --> 01:14:30.582
run for the rest of your lives together.

01:14:30.983 --> 01:14:32.000
- I love you.

01:14:32.025 --> 01:14:33.649
- I love you too.

01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:34.858
- Bae?

01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:38.384
Hey, you're still good to get the cake, right?

01:14:38.409 --> 01:14:39.540
- Yes, ma'am.

01:14:39.565 --> 01:14:41.000
- Awesome. I put Margaret on it with you,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
just to be safe.

01:14:42.648 --> 01:14:44.000
- Margaret.

01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:54.095
- All right, talk to me, baby.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.361
Who's it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?

01:14:56.386 --> 01:14:57.911
Come on, man, don't give me that.

01:14:57.936 --> 01:14:59.661
We're just two girls talking.

01:14:59.686 --> 01:15:01.666
I get it, though. It's tough.

01:15:01.733 --> 01:15:03.000
Magpie's your dream girl.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.025
She's confident, beautiful,

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:07.505
and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire.

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.000
Now Bae's waxing her other hand.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Whoo!

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.079
She's smart, funny, quick,

01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:13.975
and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.029
- Peter. - What?

01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:17.660
I'm not objectifying Margaret, man.

01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:19.000
That'd be inappropriate. That's my cousin.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.577
- It's inappropriate with Bae too.

01:15:20.602 --> 01:15:22.241
- This is deeper than I thought.

01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:23.884
Hey, Sydney!

01:15:23.909 --> 01:15:26.217
My boy is in love!

01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:27.708
- Stop, dude, just stop. - What?

01:15:27.733 --> 01:15:28.733
- I know what you're doing.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:30.086
I know what you've all been doing.

01:15:30.111 --> 01:15:32.037
You set us up, and we went along with it.

01:15:32.062 --> 01:15:33.062
But it's fake.

01:15:33.374 --> 01:15:34.374
- It was my stepdad, right?

01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:35.399
He can't act for shit.

01:15:35.858 --> 01:15:36.858
- You suck too, bro.

01:15:36.883 --> 01:15:37.883
- That's foul, dog.

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.908
It's definitely gotta be Bae, man.

01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:40.933
- I don't know, man.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.958
I don't fucking know.

01:15:41.983 --> 01:15:42.983
She doesn't know what she wants.

01:15:43.008 --> 01:15:46.008
She's single for basically the first time in her life.

01:15:46.033 --> 01:15:47.033
She just quit law school.

01:15:47.058 --> 01:15:49.058
Her fucking fiancé's here.

01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.083
- Man, stop with all the white boy--

01:15:51.108 --> 01:15:53.108
- What the-- - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.133
Seriously.

01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:56.258
Anytime something gets real, you run away,

01:15:56.283 --> 01:15:58.283
call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse,

01:15:58.308 --> 01:15:59.867
and you just move on to the next.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:01.417
It's Bae.

01:16:01.899 --> 01:16:03.521
We jumped off a boat for her.

01:16:07.315 --> 01:16:08.499
- Oh, that's perfect.

01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:09.457
They're gonna love it.

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:10.482
Thank you so much.

01:16:10.507 --> 01:16:11.741
- Let me get this boxed up for you.

01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:13.766
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:16:14.774 --> 01:16:16.616
- I don't get all the pageantry of weddings.

01:16:16.641 --> 01:16:17.975
If you like someone, give 'em a snog.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Keep it to yourselves.

01:16:19.427 --> 01:16:21.427
- I wore a wedding dress for Halloween

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.452
for five years in a row.

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.183
- Stop it.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.208
- No, I know.

01:16:24.233 --> 01:16:25.233
It's so pathetic.

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:27.452
But I am with you now.

01:16:27.477 --> 01:16:29.252
This is not for me.

01:16:29.277 --> 01:16:31.152
- So you and Ben aren't serious?

01:16:31.177 --> 01:16:32.925
- What?

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.950
No, no, it's just...

01:16:35.403 --> 01:16:38.528
we're just situationally together.

01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:39.912
- 'Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor,

01:16:39.937 --> 01:16:41.476
I thought it might be more with you two.

01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:44.600
- Just...situationally.

01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:47.625
- Is that an American thing? - I don't even know.

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:50.650
- So you're right if I have a go at him, then?

01:16:51.034 --> 01:16:53.000
I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose.

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:57.566
- If that's not okay, just tell me.

01:16:57.591 --> 01:16:58.708
For real.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.000
- I know he really likes you.

01:17:07.595 --> 01:17:09.832
- How do you think I should play this with Ben?

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:12.357
Should I wait until after the wedding?

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:14.285
- Um...I don't know.

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:15.059
- Have you guys hooked up?

01:17:15.084 --> 01:17:16.084
- Hey. - We're Beatrice.

01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:17.309
- You quit school?

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.334
- You're just gonna pour gasoline on everything you've worked for?

01:17:19.359 --> 01:17:21.000
- Is there still time to re-enroll?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
- Soon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot.

01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:25.781
- Are you on drugs? Because at least then I'd understand.

01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:28.755
- Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780
- You quit school? - What?

01:17:29.805 --> 01:17:31.000
- When were you gonna tell us?

01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:32.364
- Is this to get back at us?

01:17:32.389 --> 01:17:34.000
I'm sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
We're such awful parents.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
- Mom, this isn't about you.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
- Yes it is. It is about us.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And no, we're not gonna let you throw away your life

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
because you're going through something.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Everyone is always going through something.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
It's called life.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
- Hey.

01:17:49.801 --> 01:17:51.000
- I can't believe you.

01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:52.622
You told him I quit school?

01:17:52.647 --> 01:17:53.391
- No, I didn't.

01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.000
- You told Pete. Pete told us.

01:17:55.468 --> 01:17:56.354
- I told you what?

01:17:56.379 --> 01:17:58.944
- Yeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn't mean it like that.

01:17:58.969 --> 01:17:59.691
- Told me what?

01:17:59.864 --> 01:18:01.392
- That we're gonna find out at some point.

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:02.901
- That's not for you to decide.

01:18:02.926 --> 01:18:03.768
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

01:18:03.793 --> 01:18:05.611
- It doesn't matter how we found out.

01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:06.383
- Found out what?

01:18:06.408 --> 01:18:08.000
- She quit law school.

01:18:08.244 --> 01:18:09.000
- Oh, yeah, I knew that.

01:18:09.222 --> 01:18:10.222
- You're real shit.

01:18:10.403 --> 01:18:12.000
- I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:14.281
- There's a reason why you're alone. No one can trust you.

01:18:14.947 --> 01:18:16.000
- Yeah, what's your reason?

01:18:16.573 --> 01:18:17.975
- Guys like you.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
- Keep telling yourself that.

01:18:20.549 --> 01:18:21.000
- Fuck off.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.628
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this right here, right now.

01:18:23.653 --> 01:18:25.505
I messed this all up. It's all on me.

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:27.585
- Why don't we all go for a swim, eh?

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:28.952
Cool off before the wedding?

01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:30.715
- That's a great idea. Maybe early drinks?

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:34.793
- Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined.

01:18:34.818 --> 01:18:37.000
We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:38.631
- You knew?

01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:39.861
- What are they even talking about?

01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:43.045
- Well, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.420
in order for peace to prevail across the land.

01:18:45.518 --> 01:18:46.518
- You lied to us?

01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:49.028
What have you been honest about lately?

01:18:49.053 --> 01:18:50.653
- So you lied to me too?

01:18:50.897 --> 01:18:52.000
You're not together?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
- I could never be with someone like him.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
- Yeah, 'cause I'm the one who fucked it up.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.355
- You did fuck it up.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.147
- I fucked it up?

01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.000
- Yeah, you fucked it up.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
- I fucked it up?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
- You fucked it up.

01:19:01.756 --> 01:19:02.756
- Oh, no.

01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:04.000
- Bad dog, Kalonofin.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I mean, good dog, you killed that shit,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.742
but next time read the room, Kaymoney.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
- I am so sorry.

01:19:26.048 --> 01:19:27.000
- Hey, uh...

01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:30.000
- Bae.

01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:34.427
- I think he's gonna be fine.

01:19:34.452 --> 01:19:35.452
He's gonna be fine.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:37.000
He's gonna be fine.

01:20:11.499 --> 01:20:14.687
Good, you're perfect.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260
Relax, you're working yourself up.

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.260
It is not fine. It is not everything.

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.611
It is fine.

01:20:44.636 --> 01:20:47.235
Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here,

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.568
celebrate us, and they are ruining it.

01:20:49.593 --> 01:20:51.593
And all week and I have been so stressed,

01:20:52.065 --> 01:20:54.235
and you've been more worried about what's going on with bae

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.260
than with me.

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.260
Well, you've been more concerned about your planning.

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.052
Are you marrying me or your itinerary?

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.260
Well, if that's how you feel,

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.149
then why are we even doing this?

01:21:07.082 --> 01:21:08.760
I don't know.

01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:10.042
You tell me.

01:21:17.964 --> 01:21:19.701
There's one last thing we need to fake.

01:21:49.003 --> 01:21:51.260
Claudia, Allie, we're assholes.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.563
We're really sorry.

01:21:53.588 --> 01:21:56.516
I'm a terrible sister, and he's a terrible friend.

01:21:56.877 --> 01:21:58.541
It's your guys' big day.

01:21:58.566 --> 01:22:00.260
We're not gonna mess it up, we promise.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:02.594
Uh-huh, but just so you both know,

01:22:02.619 --> 01:22:05.260
if you fuck up today, the something I borrowed

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.260
is a knife, and it's shiny and new.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.260
Love is intoxicating.

01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.260
It envelops you, it tickles you,

01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:02.260
and it makes you feel like you can walk on air.

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.260
It's like this wind.

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.260
It's in your bones, it's in your breath,

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.030
it's in every beat of your heart.

01:23:08.055 --> 01:23:10.260
You can't look for it, you can't describe it,

01:23:10.696 --> 01:23:12.939
and you can't escape it.

01:23:13.013 --> 01:23:16.260
Allie, I love you so much,

01:23:16.656 --> 01:23:18.865
and I don't think I say it enough.

01:23:18.926 --> 01:23:20.926
You are the yin to my yang,

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.260
peanut butter to my jelly,

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.499
and I will love you forever and always.

01:23:25.786 --> 01:23:29.229
Claudia, I love you with so much of my heart

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.260
that none is left to protest.

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.891
That's very good.

01:23:33.916 --> 01:23:35.916
Just made it up.

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.378
A lot of it.

01:23:46.452 --> 01:23:49.146
I now pronounce you married!

01:23:56.452 --> 01:23:57.162
Yeah!

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.016
Oh, look, there she is.

01:24:28.905 --> 01:24:30.260
Oh, hey, parents.

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.260
Is that Tasmania?

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.260
Yeah.

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.023
How are you doing, honey?

01:24:36.048 --> 01:24:39.048
I am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.260
I didn't want to disappoint you guys again.

01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.260
Well, if you'd just told us, maybe we could have--

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.543
Trying to talk me out of it?

01:24:44.568 --> 01:24:46.568
No, maybe we could have supported you.

01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.260
I know this is scary for you guys.

01:24:50.184 --> 01:24:51.740
Yeah, it's scary for me too,

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.260
and I gotta figure it out on my own.

01:24:54.577 --> 01:24:57.042
I know that every now and then

01:24:57.067 --> 01:24:58.260
we might come off as a little...

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.671
Controlling?

01:24:59.696 --> 01:25:00.260
No.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.260
Overbearing?

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:01.844
No.

01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:02.869
Actually crazy?

01:25:02.894 --> 01:25:03.585
Yes.

01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:07.160
That's it, but only because we love you so much.

01:25:09.726 --> 01:25:10.974
Love you.

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.260
Good luck.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.260
Good luck.

01:25:48.192 --> 01:25:48.701
Hi, Aunt.

01:25:48.734 --> 01:25:49.260
Yes?

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260
Do you mind if I steal a hand?

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.805
Uh, not at all.

01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:52.260
Go ahead.

01:25:53.252 --> 01:25:53.615
High five.

01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:56.882
Hey.

01:25:58.889 --> 01:25:59.480
Hi.

01:26:01.748 --> 01:26:02.748
Where's Bo?

01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:04.260
He buggered off.

01:26:04.736 --> 01:26:08.260
He said he saw a wave he couldn't morally not surf.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.260
I'm sorry.

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:12.260
It was never really anything.

01:26:13.172 --> 01:26:14.260
And you and Bea.

01:26:14.728 --> 01:26:18.260
She said you were just situational.

01:26:18.783 --> 01:26:20.260
She said that?

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:33.926
Are you good?

01:26:34.074 --> 01:26:37.260
Yeah, we know it's been a tough weekend for you.

01:26:38.233 --> 01:26:39.260
I don't know.

01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:42.260
These last few days really made me realize

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.260
how much I miss you.

01:26:47.113 --> 01:26:48.722
Why don't you just go for a walk?

01:26:48.755 --> 01:26:49.260
Figure your head.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.260
Yeah, we'll go with you.

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.260
No, we won't.

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.260
No.

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.260
I love you, but this is our wedding.

01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.260
So...

01:26:55.612 --> 01:26:56.260
Are you sure?

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.260
Yeah.

01:26:57.830 --> 01:27:00.260
I might go and do some people watching.

01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:02.260
Just not...

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.260
these people.

01:27:07.348 --> 01:27:08.260
Thank you.

01:27:18.388 --> 01:27:19.260
Wow.

01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:21.499
Ben.

01:27:27.845 --> 01:27:29.845
I wanted this for so long.

01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:34.260
But I think I'm just holding on to a memory.

01:27:35.301 --> 01:27:36.493
And also, I...

01:27:40.913 --> 01:27:42.260
I'm sorry.

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.260
I'm so sorry.

01:28:26.943 --> 01:28:28.637
I've never seen Bea like this before.

01:28:28.662 --> 01:28:29.260
Really?

01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:31.963
You were the one who said there's a thin line

01:28:31.988 --> 01:28:33.260
between love and hate.

01:28:33.566 --> 01:28:36.337
You're always the first person to say that bit, you know?

01:28:36.362 --> 01:28:37.260
I know it sounds crazy,

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.260
but even when they were yapping at each other,

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.260
I've never seen Bea happier.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.260
Same with Ben.

01:28:43.727 --> 01:28:46.260
Hey, stepfather, may I have a word?

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.507
Yes, but make it quick, son.

01:28:47.532 --> 01:28:50.312
I promised my lady a dance, but don't tell your mother.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.260
You're so clever.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.260
You know who's also clever?

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.260
Ben.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.260
You know who else would be perfect for Ben?

01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.260
That mumbly girl who always looks like she's got a secret.

01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.260
You know her name is Bea.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.260
That was a callback.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.831
Will you stop?

01:29:06.023 --> 01:29:07.023
Stop.

01:29:08.186 --> 01:29:09.694
How you going, mate? How you going, Ben?

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:10.719
What, you two?

01:29:11.293 --> 01:29:12.046
What?

01:29:12.071 --> 01:29:15.583
Just enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.

01:29:15.608 --> 01:29:16.608
Just stop.

01:29:16.633 --> 01:29:18.260
Bro, we literally didn't know you were standing there.

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.260
Yeah, it's true. We didn't know you were listening.

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.260
We did.

01:29:20.538 --> 01:29:21.260
It was greatly a performance for one.

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.857
And we nailed it, too.

01:29:22.882 --> 01:29:23.882
What is with you people?

01:29:24.343 --> 01:29:26.260
This entire weekend, I have been lied to

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.856
and manipulated and puppeteered.

01:29:29.485 --> 01:29:31.418
I don't know what is real and what is not.

01:29:31.443 --> 01:29:33.260
Mate, I know you're a little blurry,

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260
but I meant what I said up there about love.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:39.260
It's too precious a resource to be wasted.

01:29:40.044 --> 01:29:41.260
I haven't seen her. Is she, uh--

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.260
She went on a walk a while ago.

01:29:43.829 --> 01:29:46.260
After she saw you kissing Margaret.

01:29:46.588 --> 01:29:48.260
What?

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260
No, I didn't kiss Margaret.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.260
Margaret kissed me. I backed up.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260
I don't want to be with Margaret.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.260
I want to--

01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.260
Stop it.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.260
You gorgeous idiot.

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.260
Run. Don't wait on love.

01:29:57.682 --> 01:29:58.682
Fight for it.

01:29:58.947 --> 01:30:01.043
And don't worry about the age difference.

01:30:01.072 --> 01:30:02.000
I'm 29.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.100
Honey, no one's 29.

01:30:05.574 --> 01:30:06.492
Do you know where she went?

01:30:06.517 --> 01:30:09.164
She said she wanted to walk around, do some people watching.

01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:10.574
That's what she said?

01:30:10.663 --> 01:30:11.538
People watching?

01:30:11.563 --> 01:30:14.380
I think it was more of a euphemism for crying alone.

01:30:15.565 --> 01:30:17.565
No, it's not.

01:30:18.157 --> 01:30:19.830
I think I know where she might be.

01:30:19.855 --> 01:30:21.855
Good God, man, go get her.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.447
Scour the city block by block.

01:30:23.472 --> 01:30:24.681
Scan the grid.

01:30:24.706 --> 01:30:25.956
First north, south, then east, west.

01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:27.347
Leo, I know exactly where she is.

01:30:27.372 --> 01:30:29.372
It makes it a lot easier.

01:30:35.258 --> 01:30:38.000
I just need to find my moving train.

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:42.000
What's going on here?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Is that coffee?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Oh, wait.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.521
Call harbor rescue!

01:30:52.546 --> 01:30:56.000
Oh, my God!

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Oh, my God!

01:31:04.328 --> 01:31:07.016
What the hell? Are you crazy?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Please ask a favor!

01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:25.617
Why don't you just treat people like my folks?

01:32:25.641 --> 01:32:27.641
Just go get the girl.

01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:29.666
Thank you!

01:32:39.078 --> 01:32:40.808
Excuse me!

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:42.833
Excuse me!

01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:57.215
I didn't kiss Margaret. She kissed me.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.240
I know that's a bullshit excuse, but it's true.

01:33:00.985 --> 01:33:02.000
I couldn't find a moving train.

01:33:02.815 --> 01:33:04.849
Sorry, it's the best I could do.

01:33:05.293 --> 01:33:07.090
Are you out of your mind?

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:08.000
Yeah.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Because it's been two years since we met

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
and I haven't spent every single day with you.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
That's the sign of a crazy person.

01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:16.000
I hated you.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.661
I didn't really give you a choice.

01:33:17.686 --> 01:33:19.350
I definitely didn't hate you.

01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:21.139
You called me a bitch.

01:33:21.164 --> 01:33:22.821
I said you were acting like a bitch.

01:33:22.846 --> 01:33:23.854
No, I was a bitch.

01:33:25.487 --> 01:33:26.537
The way I handled everything.

01:33:26.562 --> 01:33:27.733
The way I handled the first night.

01:33:27.758 --> 01:33:29.485
The way I handled last night.

01:33:30.321 --> 01:33:32.310
Yeah, it wasn't really awesome.

01:33:32.777 --> 01:33:34.766
Why did you leave?

01:33:35.377 --> 01:33:37.377
I thought you were going to regret it.

01:33:37.677 --> 01:33:40.178
And I couldn't face the idea of losing someone else

01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:41.517
that I...

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I really loved.

01:33:45.909 --> 01:33:48.360
Last night was the first thing I haven't regretted

01:33:48.385 --> 01:33:50.000
in a long time.

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.000
I love the way we fight.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I love how smart you are.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I love the weird way you

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
stick your hands down my pants.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.834
And I love how you know what you don't want.

01:34:03.634 --> 01:34:05.212
And if it's not me,

01:34:05.512 --> 01:34:06.654
if I don't

01:34:06.679 --> 01:34:08.000
check all your boxes,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.502
if I'm not the one,

01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:11.224
I get it.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That would really,

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
really fucking suck.

01:34:21.988 --> 01:34:24.000
So, you gonna kiss me now?

01:34:25.828 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah, I am.

01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:44.000
That's a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yeah, I'm dying. I need some air.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.697
How do they know my Serenity song?

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.360
- I'm sorry you almost called off your wedding

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.920
because of all of our bullshit.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.160
- What? - What?

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.880
- I saw you arguing on the porch.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.360
- Oh, no, no, no, we staged a fake fight

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
so you guys would feel bad and make up.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.640
- Are you marrying your precious itinerary or me?

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.560
- Well, if that's how you feel,

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.660
I don't know why we're doing this anymore.

01:37:34.828 --> 01:37:35.760
- Thank you very much.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.600
- Puppets.

01:37:37.395 --> 01:37:38.580
We're just puppets.

01:37:39.406 --> 01:37:40.420
- Yep.
