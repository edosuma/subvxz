WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.079
(SHOUTS)

00:03.080 --> 00:05.199
RICHARD: I know you're
looking into Tyler's death

00:05.200 --> 00:06.759
and whether there were drugs involved.

00:06.760 --> 00:07.760
The club said you are.

00:07.761 --> 00:09.439
I can't discuss this
reference with you, Richard.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.319
It could break causation for Nate,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.079
so if you know anything,
I need to hear it.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.158
I find there is a reasonable
prospect of conviction

00:16.160 --> 00:18.919
and commit Nathaniel Baldwin
to trial for manslaughter.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.919
You are supposed to be keeping
him out of jail, Richard.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.399
I'm not getting locked up!

00:23.400 --> 00:25.559
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.839
Cindi.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.599
Pearl.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.439
Where's Tyler's jersey?

00:30.440 --> 00:31.919
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.721
- Yeah...
- That was my brother's!

00:33.727 --> 00:34.999
You psycho bitch!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.799
I'm not going back
to that shithole. No way.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.399
Well, where else is there. Home?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.679
As if.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.399
I'll figure something else out.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.639
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.599
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.799
- BIANCA: She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.759
- You all good? Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.719
This is right before
the time of the fire,

00:50.720 --> 00:52.519
from a petrol station two minutes away.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.599
TRACEY: That's who set
fire to Wazim's house?

00:54.600 --> 00:56.039
Has to be.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.399
Who are you?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.959
You mean to say you deliberately
arranged extra payments

00:59.960 --> 01:01.359
outside the salary cap?

01:01.360 --> 01:03.519
That's all. No bets, no fixes.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.919
We just wanted Nate.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.239
I had to tell them about
Nate, just the salary cap.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.880
Shit.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.039
I've been informed that
the APL has a report

01:37.040 --> 01:40.319
alleging that the Northern
Devils Football Club

01:40.320 --> 01:42.319
was involved in breaching
their salary cap

01:42.320 --> 01:45.719
to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.999
I merely wish to confirm
there is no direct evidence

01:49.000 --> 01:52.679
linking Pax Car Rentals
to this allegation,

01:52.680 --> 01:55.040
and I'm confident that
any investigation...

02:04.320 --> 02:06.679
Great fucking timing!

02:06.680 --> 02:07.999
Fuck this.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.199
As sponsors, we are not privy

02:10.199 --> 02:12.359
to any of the financial arrangements

02:12.360 --> 02:16.039
the club may enter into
with any of its players.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.120
How can he get away with that?

02:19.120 --> 02:21.919
Uh, well, he's choosing
his words very carefully.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.199
I mean, the deal was verbal.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.519
Pax itself was never mentioned

02:26.520 --> 02:29.479
and he's fighting to keep
that company afloat.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.319
But he made a statement.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.199
Well, it depends how
much of that statement

02:34.200 --> 02:36.439
we did or didn't pass on to the APL.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.079
And, as I'm sure you can imagine,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.279
most of Mr King's evidence
had to remain confidential

02:40.280 --> 02:42.479
in order for us to conduct
our investigation.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.799
So those transcripts...

02:43.800 --> 02:45.959
Were considerably redacted
for security...

02:45.960 --> 02:48.639
- security...
- purposes.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.879
I don't want us giving him any favours.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.879
"Ah, thank you, Tony."
"Don't mention it, Janet."

02:52.880 --> 02:55.079
Well, why are you helping
him? He's not your father.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.800
No, but he's still yours.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.599
You going to call Richard
Stirling about a deal with Nate?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.079
What? No.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.359
No?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.799
He'd do anything to stop his client

03:04.800 --> 03:06.559
facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?

03:06.560 --> 03:07.959
Thug and salary cheat,

03:07.960 --> 03:10.319
all over every news feed,
and we need Nate talking.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.759
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced

03:11.760 --> 03:13.519
Clay Nelson to kill
himself inside his house.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.879
Which is why my position will be
stronger when Richard calls me.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.680
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.439
Anything else?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.439
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality
in the Public Service breakfast

03:25.440 --> 03:26.560
this morning.

03:26.561 --> 03:28.879
Owen Mitchell was telling
us how he'd single-handedly

03:28.880 --> 03:30.960
raised the ratio of women at the DPP.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.239
I thought that'd get your attention.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.799
Anyway, we got talking

03:36.800 --> 03:38.639
and he said there was a
change in prosecutors

03:38.640 --> 03:39.840
for the Baldwin trial.

03:39.841 --> 03:41.799
And who is it now?

03:41.800 --> 03:44.279
I thought you had a good
relationship with the press?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.119
Darling, if this was
just dirt on the floor

03:46.120 --> 03:47.439
I could sweep it under the rug.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.599
But unfortunately, the whole
bloody house is on fire.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.479
Well, it does make an
acquittal even more difficult.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.399
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!

03:53.400 --> 03:55.879
God, how did this become so hard?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.919
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.319
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.919
I mean, why invest all that money

04:01.920 --> 04:04.119
and then hang the club and
its star player out to dry?

04:04.120 --> 04:07.280
Okay, right now we just need to
focus on getting Nate cleared.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.759
That's the main game right
now. What are you doing?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.040
Focusing.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.119
Janet. Hi.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.839
Please, it's a simple question.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.439
Have you identified the drug Tyler
was taking before he was killed?

04:19.440 --> 04:21.559
Is your client willing to
tell us the name of the man

04:21.560 --> 04:23.839
who gave him an envelope
of cash the other day,

04:23.840 --> 04:26.559
and everything he knows about
match-fixing and gambling?

04:26.560 --> 04:29.639
He might, if he was sure
it meant he'd avoid jail.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.319
It's the only chance he has.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.719
No trial is a foregone conclusion,
Janet, you know that.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.879
And without the drug, you
have little defence.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.959
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.999
Why don't you go and advise your client

04:41.000 --> 04:43.119
how to stay out of jail, all right?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.639
When he talks, we'll act.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.839
Oh, and I take it you've
heard about the new Crown

04:47.840 --> 04:49.480
you'll be opposing?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.199
OWEN: You've done an
excellent job on the brief.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.279
It's so strong, a three-legged
dog could win it.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.480
LINA: Woof.

04:59.481 --> 05:02.079
Lina, if it was at all possible
for you to run it, you would be.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.959
And I'll definitely make
sure you get all due credit

05:03.960 --> 05:05.559
when the time comes.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.119
Owen!

05:07.120 --> 05:08.879
Hi. Sorry, Lina.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.319
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?

05:11.320 --> 05:12.799
Yes.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.239
- Who?
- LINA: Guess.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
What?

05:15.241 --> 05:18.799
Richard! How good's this, eh?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.439
Mate against mate.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.199
Ben McMahon.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.599
Yep! Former colleagues going toe to toe.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.079
Should be fun, right?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.560
Play nice, kids.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.919
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.439
Ah, well, mostly luck.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.879
You know, sheer arse, really.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.599
But you, keep seeing you
pop up everywhere, hmm?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.079
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.839
He asked me to represent
him, I agreed. Simple as that.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.079
Yeah, hey.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.759
Hey, not your fault
that you do your job,

05:44.760 --> 05:47.479
he gets off and reoffends,
needs your help again, right?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.439
Of course, you know,
that wouldn't happen

05:49.440 --> 05:51.519
if the prosecution did
their job properly.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.239
Are you including yourself
in that assessment?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.719
Well, he's certainly not including me.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.399
Yeah, we probably shouldn't
be discussing Nate.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.679
You're absolutely right,

05:57.680 --> 05:59.679
especially when everyone
else is discussing it.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.240
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.759
- Ben!
- What? It's just a sledge.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.999
I'll have you know,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.319
sledging is a time-honoured
tradition in Australian sport.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.840
He can take it. Let's get a coffee.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.479
BONNIE: If we track down the
arsonist, he'll probably talk,

06:17.480 --> 06:18.799
giving us one of two results...

06:18.800 --> 06:20.639
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim,

06:20.640 --> 06:22.399
or B, he's working for
the betting syndicate.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.839
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.439
A 50% chance of getting
inside the betting network.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.439
It's still a 50% chance
it'll give us nothing.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.839
Well, what's the current plan?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.599
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal

06:32.600 --> 06:34.879
based on finding a drug we
don't know the whereabouts of.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.119
Which we may or may not get in
time for it to be of any use.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.959
Sounded better when Janet said it.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.999
That's one, two, three
indeterminate variables,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.399
and the issue there's obvious.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.879
So in terms of probability,

06:43.880 --> 06:46.519
the arsonist lead is more likely
to give us a favourable outcome

06:46.520 --> 06:47.720
than the drug.

06:47.721 --> 06:49.879
Yeah, that actually
makes a lot of sense.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.479
It's just basic probability analysis.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.200
You should pitch it to Janet.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.239
MAXINE: We don't need to cut deals.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.599
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.399
MAXINE (ON RECORDING):
You can't talk to the NCC.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.719
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.079
Well, at the moment, the only way

07:09.080 --> 07:11.079
I'm going to stay outside is if
I get hold of that drug, right?

07:11.080 --> 07:12.559
- RICHARD: Yes.
- And the only chance I've got

07:12.560 --> 07:14.719
to get that drug is if
I talk to 'em, right?

07:14.720 --> 07:15.840
Well, I don't see any other way,

07:15.841 --> 07:17.439
but I'm not totally sure
they can get it either.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.679
LUCY: So where does that leave
us, with Nate going to jail?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.480
That's not happening. What if I got it?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.520
Shit.

07:24.521 --> 07:26.800
Could she get it?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.679
MAXINE: That's the answer, isn't it?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.119
You see, if I get the drug,

07:31.120 --> 07:33.079
he stays out of jail, doesn't
have to talk to anyone.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.439
That's problem solved.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.359
Are you sure you can find it?

07:36.360 --> 07:38.960
You worry about your job, Richard,
and I'll worry about mine.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.519
Okay, we need to track Maxine's phone.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.639
Can I also remind people
about the arsonist...

07:46.640 --> 07:48.240
Later! Just track Maxine, all right?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.079
You think she can get it?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.799
Hard to tell.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.679
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.799
If she knew exactly where to
find it, she'd already have it.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.199
But she knows Eddie Cooke

08:03.200 --> 08:06.159
was behind the supplement
program for the Devils, like we do.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.639
I bet that's where she's going.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.959
She's wasting her time.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.079
We searched every inch of
Continuum and came up empty.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.479
True, but if that drug underpinned
the bet on the Devils,

08:13.480 --> 08:14.719
it has to be somewhere.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.599
It's too valuable to completely destroy.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.959
But would Eddie just hand over a
secret drug to a sports agent?

08:19.960 --> 08:21.639
No, he's going to want to avoid any link

08:21.640 --> 08:22.800
between him and the drug.

08:22.801 --> 08:25.119
That'd just kill his
business completely.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.359
He's going to want a lot of
assurances about anonymity, etc.,

08:28.360 --> 08:30.679
before he thinks about
handing it over to anyone.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.279
But he might, eventually,
to stop Nate talking.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.078
Unless we can convince him to
hand it to one of us first.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.679
Well, not one of us, obviously.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.679
No, somebody he thinks has
absolutely nothing to do with us,

08:41.679 --> 08:44.919
like an undercover agent
who goes in there

08:44.920 --> 08:46.959
as an elite athlete in need of help.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.759
Going to need a pretty good
undercover cop to pull that off.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.879
Okay, is she? She's going
to Eddie's, isn't she?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.319
Looks like it.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.039
Okay, I think he keeps it off-site.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.439
We need to watch these two,
see where they go after this.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.959
(SCREEN BEEPS)

09:01.960 --> 09:04.399
MAXINE: Eddie, please.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.560
Now what's better for you?

09:05.561 --> 09:07.599
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal,

09:07.600 --> 09:09.079
or Nate at home, free as a bird?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.679
I don't know what Tyler took.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.719
I do. He did what he was told.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.719
He followed the club rules to the letter

09:14.720 --> 09:16.159
because he needed that contract.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.999
He wouldn't have done
anything to jeopardise that.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.859
So whatever he took, he got here.
I know the sports world, Eddie.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.986
You see a lot of people,
they tell me a lot of things,

09:23.992 --> 09:26.679
not least my 42 clients, but
especially the five Devils.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.559
I'm in the know, you got that?

09:28.560 --> 09:31.680
So cut the crap and give me
what you were giving them.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.999
- There's none left.
- (SCOFFS) That's bullshit.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.879
What, a drug that good, that
gets the Devils into the semis?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.199
As if you'd run out of that.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.119
We'd get supplied when
there was a demand,

09:42.120 --> 09:44.599
but with Tyler's death and
the NCC strangling us,

09:44.600 --> 09:46.479
that demand is gone.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.239
I don't have any left.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.600
Well, get some more.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.119
Okay.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.559
I will ask my supplier, but
I can't guarantee anything.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.120
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.520
I'll be back, Eddie.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.319
Hello. Where are they?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.879
Liam's at the sausage sizzle,
and Em's at the 70 metre start.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.319
Okay, great. Have you spoken to Zoe yet?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.040
Good luck.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.439
ZOE: Tom, take your mark
back, then fast at the bar!

10:22.440 --> 10:23.719
Hey, Zoe.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.119
And drive the knee up! Hey,
Janet. Hey, how's Emma?

10:26.120 --> 10:27.719
Great. Yeah, she's loving it.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.359
Liam was too, but his ankle's
still not better, so...

10:30.360 --> 10:33.159
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.879
Oh, no, that girl you were coaching?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.719
Six weeks out from Worlds,
ranked number two.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.239
Last week, she's looking at a medal,

10:38.240 --> 10:39.959
now we're not even sure if
she's going to make it.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.519
That must be heartbreaking for her.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.879
Well, yeah.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.039
When you give up six years, stop
working, count every calorie.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.839
But I suppose in Liam's world,

10:47.840 --> 10:50.319
if he can't run at Zone, I
feel sorry for him too.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.639
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.399
He's only upset because I wouldn't
give him a day off school.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.079
Um, but, look, I was
hoping to have a chat,

10:56.080 --> 10:58.399
because I'm kind of involved
with sport at the moment,

10:58.400 --> 10:59.799
in a funny sort of way,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.519
and given who you are and what you do,

11:01.520 --> 11:04.200
I was hoping to pick your brains.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.239
All right, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.399
You nailed that brief.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.479
Do you remember how much we used
to struggle with summaries?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.279
Oh, yeah, practice
makes perfect, I guess.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.479
No, I really shouldn't. I've
got to head back and...

11:20.480 --> 11:22.799
Oh, come on, come on. The bar's
just around the corner, isn't it?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.719
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.879
- That's a beautiful name.
- Oh, thanks.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.559
Hey, check this.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.719
- Oh!
- That's my wife, Bella.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.199
- Oh, yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.999
Gorgeous.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.319
I just wish I got to see
them more, to be honest.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.479
But I do most of my prep at night,

11:40.480 --> 11:42.679
you know, start mapping
out my opening addresses,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.159
marking up witness statements,
lines of interrogation...

11:45.160 --> 11:47.199
You've got a two-year-old and
you get all that done at night?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.879
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.599
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work,

11:51.600 --> 11:53.879
so she does most of the hard
yards with Remy, you know?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.159
Yeah.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.439
I'm like a "cuddle and
kiss goodnight" Dad.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.239
I so need a wife.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.719
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.839
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.015
I... I wish I could do more.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.719
I thought you weren't
going to lift a finger

12:12.720 --> 12:14.079
unless Nate started talking.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.359
Well, things changed. Other
information came to light.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.600
But I need an assurance when we
find this drug, Nate will talk.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.439
So that was just a bluff
before. You don't have it.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.999
And if you do find material evidence

12:28.000 --> 12:30.319
in a manslaughter trial, you'll
have to hand it over anyway.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.399
Well, things do disappear
from evidence rooms

12:32.400 --> 12:33.760
from time to time.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.039
We think we can keep
your client out of jail.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.719
Your job is to buy us the time

12:39.720 --> 12:41.799
so we can wrap this up to
everyone's satisfaction,

12:41.800 --> 12:44.679
without a trial actually starting.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.880
Richard! How are you, mate?

12:49.080 --> 12:51.159
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.759
Wow!

12:52.760 --> 12:55.719
What's it been, like,
four or five years?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.759
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.279
Thank you, and I hear
you're, um... married.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.159
Yes, yes.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.879
Yeah, got all responsible. Settled down.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.439
The Premier's daughter?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.399
So, isn't it more accurate
to say she settled down,

13:08.400 --> 13:09.440
you settled up?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.839
I'm joking. I'm sure
there's a lot of love there.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.399
Yeah.

13:14.400 --> 13:19.639
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.360
Thank you, yes.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.439
But hey, look how far
we've all come, right?

13:25.440 --> 13:29.160
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...

13:30.800 --> 13:32.520
Future Nobel Laureate.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.399
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.999
- Stay in touch, huh?
- Yep.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.559
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise. See you, Janet.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.720
Yep.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.679
- I should go too.
- Oh!

13:47.685 --> 13:49.746
You've gotta be kidding me, right?
You're having a drink with me.

13:49.752 --> 13:52.559
After the trial might be more
appropriate, don't you think?

13:52.560 --> 13:54.919
Let's cross swords first and
then once it's all done,

13:54.920 --> 13:56.959
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?

13:56.960 --> 14:00.159
What sword's he got? What
sword do you have, seriously?

14:00.160 --> 14:01.919
I mean, I couldn't
even find a tooth-pick

14:01.920 --> 14:03.120
in the facts that I read.

14:03.121 --> 14:04.679
I'm surprised you're
not pleading guilty.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.439
One more. Come on, my shout.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.399
And we won't mention the
case again, will we?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.440
Oh, never.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.239
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.239
You're not nervous?
Shit, I'd be nervous.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.239
I'd be sweating more than
a gypsy with a mortgage,

14:17.240 --> 14:18.519
to be honest with you.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.279
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.679
Seriously, major trial,

14:21.680 --> 14:24.799
in the public spotlight,
up against this one.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.679
With no defence. You
got enough underwear?

14:27.680 --> 14:29.719
(CHUCKLES) Pssh, right?

14:29.720 --> 14:32.000
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.520
I'll see you later.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.039
WAYNE: So you know Zoe DiCosta?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.239
Oh, I've only met her a couple of times.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.999
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.279
Oh, wow. Have you actually
seen her gold medal race?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.039
No, but I should look that up.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.119
She attacked about 6K out,

14:57.120 --> 14:59.599
putting about 30 seconds
between her and the peloton.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.559
Couple of chasers went after
her, but she fended them off.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.919
She was battling a really nasty headwind

15:04.920 --> 15:07.319
for the last K and a half too,

15:07.320 --> 15:09.439
so, yeah, it was a
really, really gutsy ride.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.640
Sounds impressive.

15:10.641 --> 15:12.119
Yeah, it was,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.279
especially as the Spaniard
who took the bronze

15:14.280 --> 15:16.439
got done for doping two years later.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.039
Really?

15:18.040 --> 15:20.759
Yeah, see, PEDs give you
that extra 1% edge,

15:20.760 --> 15:22.199
but it doesn't mean much

15:22.200 --> 15:24.999
without putting in the
99% hard work first.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.720
Zoe was just mentally tougher.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.959
You've got a similar grunt.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.916
Oh, I wasn't aware I grunted.

15:31.922 --> 15:35.602
Oh, no, no, no, it-it-it's a
good thing. Like... like ticker.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.480
Or hunger.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.559
- Pluck?
- BIANCA: Zoe's here.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.960
Great.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.039
We know the man running
this sports medicine clinic

15:50.040 --> 15:52.319
has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.759
The question is, what does an
undercover cop have to do and say

15:55.760 --> 15:56.960
to make him believe

15:56.961 --> 15:59.359
they are genuinely from
the world of elite sport

15:59.360 --> 16:02.719
and then, how to ask for
some of this substance?

16:02.720 --> 16:04.839
It's not on the banned list?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.239
No.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.799
What does it do?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.239
Well, we think it speeds up
recovery, aids endurance.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.879
God, if it was legal, I'd
be queuing up for it now.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.919
Greta'd kill her grandmother
to get her hands on the stuff.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.439
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.079
She's a total freak of nature.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.621
VO2 touching 70, threshold
242 and a monster TSS.

16:24.627 --> 16:26.599
- W-what?
- Training Stress Score.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.319
It's sort of a number
that rates your workout.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.279
But unfortunately, she's
injured at the moment, right?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.119
Getting over a torn quad,

16:32.120 --> 16:34.959
so her normalised power's
still down about 5% to 8%,

16:34.960 --> 16:36.919
and Worlds are just around the corner.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.399
So, it's a race against time.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.999
Is it ever. I think we've
seen about 11 doctors,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.559
tried just about everything.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.039
At this point, if they
said, "Take arsenic,"

16:45.040 --> 16:46.479
she probably would.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.879
And risk death?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.999
If it would fix her, probably worth it.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.479
That's the way Greta's thinking.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.159
All those sacrifices. It's...

16:53.160 --> 16:54.519
Well, yeah.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.279
If I told her I could get her
something not on the banned list

16:57.280 --> 17:00.039
that could get her to Worlds,
she'd beg me for it.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.519
Now, we should get all
this down for the cop

17:03.520 --> 17:05.878
so that they sound like they've
got the right shorthand

17:05.880 --> 17:08.439
and describe exactly what they're
looking for, sound genuine.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.599
Sure.

17:09.601 --> 17:12.759
I mean, it would also really
help if whoever we choose

17:12.760 --> 17:13.999
has a background in sport.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.159
You know any former
footballers, basketballers,

17:16.160 --> 17:17.800
someone like that on the force?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.839
So, you've got no idea
what this stuff is?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.159
None.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.319
Just say, for example... just
say I was asking for it,

17:26.319 --> 17:28.879
I wouldn't be asking for a
banned substance, right?

17:28.880 --> 17:30.559
No one's going to suggest that you...

17:30.560 --> 17:31.840
Well, hang on a second.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.919
Let's just think about it for a minute.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.879
I mean, okay, let's say that you...

17:37.880 --> 17:40.359
You never met us, but you'd
heard that this guy,

17:40.360 --> 17:43.479
Eddie Cooke, he'd been
getting great results

17:43.480 --> 17:45.879
and his athletes were
passing all the tests.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.239
I'd want to know what it was
and where I could get it.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.919
Okay, let's say he just gave
you something in a bottle.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.239
Even when I was racing,

17:52.240 --> 17:54.439
you're mad to take
whatever anyone gives you,

17:54.440 --> 17:56.799
but you can't be on your
guard the whole time.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.599
No, so you would just
take it somewhere first,

17:58.600 --> 17:59.760
to find out exactly what it was.

17:59.761 --> 18:02.719
If I didn't know what
it was, totally, yeah.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.439
I'd have to, for my own reputation.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.119
- Right.
- I'd happily do that.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.599
I mean, I haven't asked for
anything I knew is banned,

18:10.600 --> 18:11.800
and if it should be

18:11.801 --> 18:13.799
and we end up catching
a drug cheat, great.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.239
And if it turned out that it
actually did help with recovery,

18:17.240 --> 18:18.599
wasn't performance enhancing...

18:18.600 --> 18:19.880
I'd use it.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.399
Okay, so let's do it.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.320
Hang on, Janet. There are procedures
and protocols. We can't...

18:27.760 --> 18:29.799
I wasn't here.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.800
I didn't know any of this was happening.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.239
I told you, there's none left.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.799
Your inaction will mean

18:38.800 --> 18:41.079
that Nate Baldwin's going to
talk to the Crime Commission,

18:41.080 --> 18:43.119
which can't happen, as you well know.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.120
We both have reputations to uphold.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.999
I got it from my supplier,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.799
Flynn and I administered
it and now it's all gone.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.159
There's nothing I can do.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.160
You're as useless as a
shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.320
- BIANCA: Recording.
- Okay.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.879
EDDIE (ON RECORDING): Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.270
- ZOE: Doctor Cooke.
- EDDIE: Eddie, please.

19:15.276 --> 19:16.796
Welcome to Continuum.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.039
- Bonnie. You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.919
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.679
I've heard good things, and I need help.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.679
Wondered if you might be able to.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.200
I hope so.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.239
So, what's the problem?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.759
Not sure if you know, but
I'm coaching Greta Beckett.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.519
Yeah, yeah. Time triallist.
Individual pursuit. I know.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.999
She tore her quad last week.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.159
- Medialis?
- Femoris. Grade two.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.719
And when are the Worlds?

19:42.720 --> 19:45.719
Six weeks, but if she takes
three or four weeks off to recover,

19:45.720 --> 19:49.079
her power will drop, and even
down 4 or 5 watts, that's...

19:49.080 --> 19:51.799
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.239
We really need a fast recovery.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.999
She's been good with icing? Compression?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.079
- Yeah. On top of that.
- Janet?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.239
We managed it well in the
beginning, it's just now.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.479
She's got to give herself time

20:01.480 --> 20:03.639
to get her threshold back up over 240.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.959
But all the physios are saying

20:04.960 --> 20:07.679
another fortnight before she
can pedal, and Greta's like,

20:07.680 --> 20:10.079
"Get me back on the bike now."

20:10.080 --> 20:12.360
Then we heard about
you, the miracle man.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.599
Have you tried PRPs?

20:15.600 --> 20:18.519
The plasma injections? Are
they really that good?

20:18.520 --> 20:21.000
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.919
She'll take anything, Eddie.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.599
Well, obviously nothing
on the banned list.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.679
She still gets
out-of-competition tested,

20:27.680 --> 20:30.360
but if there's anything else.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.919
Please.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.560
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.079
I'm sorry, but there's not
much else I can offer.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.799
Come on, Zoe. Come on.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.520
Think of something.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.839
Eddie, if you help Greta win,
it'll be your victory too.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.799
And in front of the
whole media, I promise,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.959
you will get the credit you deserve.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.719
You will be the man who got her
back to the starting line,

21:00.720 --> 21:02.960
and everyone in the world will know it.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.279
Okay. If I can help, I'll
give you a call tomorrow.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.759
She's good.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.280
Mm, they always said
she was tough to race.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.319
FLYNN: No, it's all gone.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.879
Once Tyler died and we found
there was something weird

21:23.880 --> 21:26.280
about his blood, we binned it all.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.199
I know how you hang out with the stars,

21:30.200 --> 21:31.759
their girlfriends, whoever.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.279
And they let you.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.039
Not because you're the fun guy,
but because you sell them fun.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.119
Whatever they want, you've got.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.919
Now a drug that gets the
Devils from last to fourth,

21:41.920 --> 21:44.080
there's got to be other
buyers for that, right?

21:45.600 --> 21:48.119
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?

21:48.120 --> 21:50.479
One bottle, 20 grand. Cash.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.119
You've got to be kidding me.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.199
Oh, but it's incredible stuff.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.489
That's the price. Take it or leave it.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.160
All right, I'll take it.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.868
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.600
You gettin' 20,000 off her?

22:13.840 --> 22:16.279
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Oh, yeah, right.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.720
No, I'm serious. It's to bail my
friend Cindi out. She really needs it.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.680
You staying at home tonight?

22:30.769 --> 22:32.643
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Mm-hm.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.399
JUDGE WALKER: Mr Stirling,

22:39.400 --> 22:42.080
what is your argument for
having this trial not proceed?

22:44.120 --> 22:46.199
Your Honour, the negative publicity

22:46.200 --> 22:50.479
surrounding my client's case and
his reputation is enormous.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.679
It is inconceivable he
can receive a fair trial

22:53.680 --> 22:55.479
in the current environment.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.839
And in support of this submission?

22:57.840 --> 22:59.040
Well, yes, Your Honour.

22:59.041 --> 23:03.999
There is considerable evidence
from many internet sites

23:04.000 --> 23:05.639
that I wish to present to the court.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.999
Your Honour, do we really
need to hear all of it?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.879
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling,

23:11.880 --> 23:14.799
and the legal system has managed
to operate successfully

23:14.800 --> 23:16.119
since its inception.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.839
I appreciate that, Your Honour,

23:17.840 --> 23:19.919
but the wealth of supporting material

23:19.920 --> 23:22.639
forms a compelling basis
for my submission.

23:22.640 --> 23:27.479
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is
a very public sports figure.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.119
It would be almost
impossible to find a juror

23:30.120 --> 23:32.839
in the entire state who
had never heard of him.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.879
Indeed, yes. Even I have heard of him.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.439
Meaning recent coverage

23:36.440 --> 23:39.519
is unlikely to have altered
anyone's opinion of him.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.119
If cases are to be thrown out

23:41.120 --> 23:44.079
on the basis that social
media creates unfair trials,

23:44.080 --> 23:47.000
well, then nothing would ever
be tried in court again.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.599
My instructions to the jury
will be to take into account

23:51.600 --> 23:54.039
only evidence presented in court,

23:54.040 --> 23:55.999
not hearsay outside of it.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.479
Therefore, press coverage
cannot unduly influence them.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.639
It is impossible for
anyone to forget hearsay.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.639
Are you suggesting I am a
biased judge, Mr Stirling?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.320
Of course not, Your Honour.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.479
The request to have the trial
not proceed is denied.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.319
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.679
Your Honour, I would like to
make a last-minute request

24:15.680 --> 24:16.840
for a judge-only trial.

24:16.841 --> 24:19.359
Your Honour, my learned colleague
cannot keep delaying this trial.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.839
Exactly what I was thinking.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.559
It is in the public
interest for this trial

24:22.560 --> 24:24.759
to be completely above any
suspicion of bias, Your Honour.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.879
And given the adverse publicity
surrounding the trial...

24:27.880 --> 24:30.279
Objection, Your Honour,
it's the same argument.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.599
I am not questioning the
clarity or authority

24:32.600 --> 24:34.639
of your instructions to
the jury, Your Honour,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.480
but their ability to adhere to them.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.839
Very well.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.480
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.048
Well played, mate. See you tomorrow.

24:50.054 --> 24:52.071
- Can't wait. Bring it on.
- Mm.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.039
Can't wait for the all-nighter
on a judge-only submission.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.679
Well, he shouldn't have demolished
the not-proceed option so well.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.360
He's not really enjoying
this as much as he looks.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.439
Yes, he is.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.599
You're enjoying it too, right?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.199
I'm warming to it.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.320
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Maxine.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.240
Yes, this is...

25:37.640 --> 25:39.887
- RICHARD: 20,000?
- MAXINE: Cash.

25:39.893 --> 25:42.239
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.039
NATE: Or he might just
want to pocket 20 grand.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.119
MAXINE: We won't know for sure
until we turn up with the money.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.599
RICHARD: Have you got that much?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.119
MAXINE: Me? 20,000 in cash?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.839
What do I look like, an ATM
machine? What about you?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.000
No!

25:53.001 --> 25:55.399
Well, Nate, we could get
that somehow, couldn't we?

25:55.400 --> 25:58.039
It's just... it takes a few
days to organise that much.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.679
Right, if we're moving
that amount of cash,

25:59.680 --> 26:01.839
we've got to make sure the tax
office isn't looking at us.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.519
We'll take it out in bits.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.759
Okay, just... look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.

26:06.760 --> 26:10.080
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.399
I thought we were
tracking Maxine's phone.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.959
- BIANCA: We are.
- I am.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.759
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?

26:19.760 --> 26:20.880
You didn't tell us?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.479
How long until we can get a
listening device into Flynn's?

26:26.480 --> 26:28.119
Could take us a day to get the warrant.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.319
Okay, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.320
An hour.

26:31.321 --> 26:33.421
Okay, do it. Make sure it's
there before she goes back.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.279
But without a warrant,
anything we record is...

26:35.280 --> 26:37.599
Okay, you just need to
shut up, all right?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.399
The one time you should
have opened your mouth

26:39.400 --> 26:41.879
is the only time in the last six
weeks you've kept it closed.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.599
In case it escaped your attention,

26:43.600 --> 26:46.119
which for an analyst there
is absolutely no excuse,

26:46.120 --> 26:47.799
we're in a race here.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.119
Against time, a manslaughter
trial and Maxine Reynolds.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.199
She buys that drug,
presents it to the court,

26:53.200 --> 26:54.999
gets Nate off, we're back to square one.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.399
That's what's at stake here

26:56.400 --> 26:58.959
and you've just put all
of that in jeopardy!

26:58.960 --> 27:01.000
I'm sorry. I was...

27:05.800 --> 27:06.960
Okay, what were you doing?

27:06.961 --> 27:09.439
No, no, let me guess.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.919
You were still trying to figure
out the identity of the arsonist

27:11.920 --> 27:13.799
because you decided
that was the priority,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.399
not locating the drug.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.519
You are not running your
own reference here.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.999
You are part of a team

27:19.000 --> 27:23.160
and I am the one who dictates
the direction of it, not you.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.919
Don't make the mistake

27:25.920 --> 27:27.919
of thinking you're the
smartest person in the room.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.040
You're not.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.920
Out.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.000
LUCY: Richard.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.319
Can you just... just tell me, and
be honest, what are his chances?

27:55.320 --> 27:57.839
Maxine finding that drug could
make all the difference,

27:57.840 --> 27:59.239
providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.879
Right. If he gets locked up, I
have no money. I have nothing.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.679
Well, this isn't a crime
that they seize assets for.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.679
You'd still have your bank
accounts, your credit cards...

28:07.680 --> 28:08.680
I don't have any.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.759
I don't even have this betting
account that's supposedly mine.

28:11.760 --> 28:12.999
I wish.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.799
I mean I get my bags, make-up,
shoes, all from my sponsors,

28:15.800 --> 28:17.320
who are all dumping me quick smart.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.720
You've never had your own money?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.959
Oh, because I'm a typical WAG
who sponges off her husband

28:22.960 --> 28:24.639
and goes to the opening of an envelope?

28:24.640 --> 28:25.840
No, no, no. Of course not.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.720
Do you know how we met?

28:29.920 --> 28:31.160
In a taxi rank.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.840
Nate had been to some do and
I'd had a Mozart recital.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.039
You like classical music?

28:38.040 --> 28:40.119
I play it.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.000
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.040
Look... Nate takes care
of everything for me.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.279
He looks after me.

28:49.280 --> 28:53.639
You might want to make alternative
arrangements, just in case.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.840
He won't do that.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.360
I'll see if I can talk
some sense into him.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.600
Thank you.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.919
We should be online
in Flynn's place now.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.120
Want me to check?

29:12.121 --> 29:13.440
Yes, thank you.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.879
- PEARL: Cindi needs me.
- FLYNN: Yeah, well, I need you.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.639
PEARL: No, you don't know
what she's going through.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.840
It's really messed up.

29:22.841 --> 29:24.319
Welfare overpaid her

29:24.320 --> 29:25.959
and she owes 'em a
grand she doesn't have

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
and she can't get her benefits
until she's paid it back.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.479
You sure you can't help?

29:30.480 --> 29:32.599
I'm not a charity, Pearl.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.439
Come on, why don't... why
don't you just chill out?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.640
We can relax.

29:36.641 --> 29:40.119
The guy that killed my brother
goes on trial tomorrow.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.680
I want to have a drink with my friend.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.839
Sure. You want to see
Cindi, go see Cindi.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.439
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.759
Thanks.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.448
I just thought you needed a
place to stay, that's all.

29:53.320 --> 29:57.200
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.160
But if you go now...

30:00.560 --> 30:01.920
don't come back here.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.479
Okay.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.280
What do you want to do?

30:19.360 --> 30:20.879
I want you to take your clothes off.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.280
We can have some fun, yeah?

30:23.520 --> 30:25.319
We don't have the warrant
in place, do we?

30:25.320 --> 30:26.960
No.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.480
Good girl. Good girl.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.040
Okay. I've heard enough.

30:50.120 --> 30:53.039
Uh, don't forget to argue the
strengths of the Westminster system.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.588
Andy, what about your
mum? Can she pick Amal up?

30:56.400 --> 30:59.279
Richard's just dropped an
application for judge-only on us.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.799
You know how it's
underpinned by a belief

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
juries take their
responsibilities very seriously.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.839
No, my brother can't.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.279
His car's getting repaired.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.480
Study after study shows
this to be the case.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.880
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.

31:13.295 --> 31:15.383
OWEN: Just thought I'd check in
and see how you're both doing.

31:15.389 --> 31:17.899
- All good?
- Yeah, we're on top of it. You go.

31:17.905 --> 31:19.240
We were just finishing up.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.439
I don't want to lose another case
with a high-profile sportsman.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.359
We won't, but we could
find a few more arguments.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.359
No, we've got it with
what you've given me.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.719
You go see your daughter, right?

31:29.720 --> 31:30.880
Give her a cuddle from me.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.440
Uh, crossed wires with
Andy about childcare.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.439
First time for everything, right?

31:38.440 --> 31:39.760
Right.

31:43.649 --> 31:45.158
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.240
AMAL: Mummy.

31:59.241 --> 32:00.479
Yeah.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.319
Did you give her something for the pain?

32:03.320 --> 32:05.239
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.559
Oh, bub, those horrible
toothy-pegs still hurting?

32:07.560 --> 32:08.839
Oh, come here.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.719
Hey, you've got court
tomorrow. Go to bed.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.679
Yeah, it is tomorrow.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.839
I just want to make sure I've
got all the points in my head.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.119
Well, it's no good if your
head's asleep on the bench.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.599
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen
to think I'm not across it.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.720
Oh, as if they would.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.600
I've had to leave early
a couple of times.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.040
Oh, I...

32:26.041 --> 32:28.559
I'd change my shifts but I've
got three men on stress leave.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.280
It's fine. I can manage, Andy.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.000
Hey, uh...

32:33.920 --> 32:36.079
you don't have to prove
anything to anyone, okay?

32:36.080 --> 32:37.879
You're doing a brilliant job.

32:37.880 --> 32:41.359
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.000
You stop doubting yourself.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.080
WAYNE: Got a visual on Cooke again.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And someone's not too happy with him.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.640
Mitchell Douglas, the
coach of the Devils.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.559
Now he's getting into his car.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.400
Alone. Didn't appear to
be carrying anything.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.279
Oh, he's heading south. Bay Road.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.003
- JANET: Stay on him.
- Rightio.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.839
He's going to Flynn's. He's
going to get the drug.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.159
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.640
Heading to the bank again.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.479
She got 9 grand out yesterday.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.799
- And Flynn?
- Still snoring. Pearl's left for court.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.960
The warrant's in place,

33:32.961 --> 33:35.079
so whatever we hear now is
admissible, but we still need...

33:35.080 --> 33:36.639
That statement from Pearl.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.545
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.999
JOURNALIST: How do you
think you'll go today?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.959
Will the Devils release
you from your contract?

33:42.960 --> 33:45.479
No comment. Please, can
you give us some space?

33:45.480 --> 33:47.399
(QUIETLY) Should be
here by this afternoon.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.359
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!

33:49.360 --> 33:51.239
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.559
My son was taken from me

33:52.560 --> 33:56.999
by that monster who
pretended to be his friend.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.279
MITCHELL: You're sure you
don't need me in there?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.399
Yeah.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.440
Look, Nate's got a temper,

34:01.441 --> 34:03.399
but he's not the monster
they're making him out to be.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.079
Okay? He looked out
for Ty. This isn't fair.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.280
You weren't a witness.

34:07.281 --> 34:10.039
I've got to do something to
help make it right, okay?

34:10.040 --> 34:11.759
One of our boys has died.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.119
He was just a kid.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.320
I'm sorry, Mitchell.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.120
- Any news?
- Close. I believe we're very close.

34:25.639 --> 34:26.800
Hi, Pearl.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.697
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?

34:33.960 --> 34:35.599
You want to get away from here?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.559
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.840
Yeah?

34:40.880 --> 34:43.759
Your Honour, the Westminster
system is underpinned by the fact

34:43.760 --> 34:45.518
that juries take their responsibilities

34:45.520 --> 34:46.958
extremely seriously.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.679
I mean, the average citizen
is perfectly capable

34:49.679 --> 34:52.159
of putting hearsay and
personal bias aside

34:52.159 --> 34:55.279
and paying serious attention
to the facts presented.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.480
Your belief in the
process is commendable.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.239
Your Honour, news feeds and social media

35:05.240 --> 35:09.079
are awash with damning
indictments of the accused.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.199
Now, this is far from normal hearsay

35:12.200 --> 35:15.239
and only a trained legal
mind, such as Your Honour's,

35:15.240 --> 35:16.759
can truly ignore this bias

35:16.760 --> 35:18.479
and consider the facts,

35:18.480 --> 35:20.119
as you said yesterday.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.439
Therefore, by your own argument,

35:23.440 --> 35:26.920
you are the only person
entitled to hear this trial.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.799
Well argued, Mr Stirling.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.839
But don't ever try it again.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.160
Yes, Your Honour.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.559
I agree to the request made by Mr
Stirling for a judge-only trial.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.119
Now, gentlemen,

35:44.120 --> 35:47.240
can we declare a ceasefire
and get on with this?

35:51.800 --> 35:53.359
JANET: This must be a
difficult day for you.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.359
I can understand why you
don't want to be in there,

35:55.360 --> 35:56.719
hear everything that happened.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.239
I don't need to.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.079
He's guilty. He hit Ty.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.519
They'll lock him up and then...

36:02.520 --> 36:03.679
And then?

36:03.680 --> 36:04.760
There'll be justice.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.360
For Ty.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.520
And what about you?

36:10.560 --> 36:12.319
Don't you deserve justice?

36:12.320 --> 36:13.360
I'm all right.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.879
It's pretty clear what the
arrangement is with Flynn.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.959
He's 28 years old. You're underage.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.279
You can't legally give
consent to have...

36:23.280 --> 36:25.439
Piss off! I can give
consent whenever I want.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.039
Don't act like this isn't my choice.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.519
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.400
In six months, it won't be.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.919
I can get public housing on my own.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.319
What, so sexual abuse is the
price you're willing to pay

36:36.320 --> 36:37.719
for a roof over your head?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.199
There are better options.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.759
Yeah? Like share houses?

36:41.760 --> 36:44.239
You ever been in one?

36:44.240 --> 36:47.399
Full of junkies who just
take all your shit?

36:47.400 --> 36:48.639
Or I could go back home,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.920
to Mum getting shit-faced
and laying into me.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.480
And Kevin.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.399
Or I could, uh... sleep in
a gutter or a shop door.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.600
You think that'd be better?

37:02.601 --> 37:04.960
Of course not, but there has
to be something else, yeah?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.559
Something better than Flynn.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.960
There's not, but.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.880
That's it, you see?

37:13.520 --> 37:15.640
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.589
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
I figured out a way.

37:21.521 --> 37:22.760
I'm making it work.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.840
It's my choice, not yours.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.120
Pearl...

37:37.480 --> 37:40.159
Hard copies of all the
surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.639
Uh, thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.319
Of course, but just in case

37:44.320 --> 37:45.880
you need to cross-reference
their movements.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.639
Okay. Yeah, sure.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.599
It's what I do.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.479
I'm thorough, meticulous,
on-task, 24/7, analysing data,

37:54.480 --> 37:57.639
which, to be effective,
requires a broad scope.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.919
So while my focus may
appear to shift at times,

37:59.920 --> 38:02.079
it's only because every
piece of information

38:02.080 --> 38:03.919
needs to be studied exhaustively.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.919
I wouldn't be doing my job
properly if I didn't.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.639
You should probably be
explaining this to Janet.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.839
I think it helps if the
chief investigator

38:10.840 --> 38:13.079
also appreciates the particular
demands of an analyst.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.559
So I can put in a good
word for you, you mean?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
Oh, no.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.480
It's just...

38:19.400 --> 38:21.399
I get data, look for patterns.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.279
It's puzzle solving with
a real-world impact

38:23.280 --> 38:24.999
and I think it's a buzz and...

38:25.000 --> 38:26.399
Yeah. Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...

38:26.400 --> 38:27.600
Am I getting fired?

38:27.601 --> 38:28.999
What?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.959
Bonnie, you stuffed up. We all do.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.079
Just get over it and move on.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.839
JANET: Put Wayne on.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.639
WAYNE: He's gone into a chemist.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.160
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.439
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.559
They're old friends and
he gets a discount?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.879
Or maybe Eddie's
supplying him with PEDs.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.999
Unlikely. He's a cleanskin,
according to this.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.919
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.159
Pharmacy degree,

38:54.160 --> 38:55.719
compounding chemist of 25 years.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.319
No priors, nothing.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.560
Eddie's on the move.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.680
Could be in for more action now.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.680
He's just arrived at Flynn's.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.439
So, what did the chemist
have to do with this?

39:16.440 --> 39:18.119
We can pick up Eddie inside.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.839
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.080
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

39:24.480 --> 39:26.559
EDDIE: I told you to get rid of it.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.599
FLYNN: You know what I can get for it.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.079
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.919
Okay, I'll give you a cut.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.250
I need it now.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.079
How much have you got?

39:36.080 --> 39:37.959
50ml.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.039
I kept one bottle, that's all.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.239
As soon as he's outside,
Wayne can grab Eddie...

39:42.240 --> 39:44.399
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?

39:44.400 --> 39:47.119
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.799
Great. Much safer strategy.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.919
That wasn't meant to sound
patronising, honestly.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.799
Just... genuine.

39:53.800 --> 39:54.840
No offence.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.599
BEN: Could you show the
court what you saw

40:00.600 --> 40:02.439
when the accused hit the victim?

40:02.440 --> 40:05.400
It was like this, to
the side of Ty's face.

40:10.680 --> 40:13.079
He stumbled, fell backwards.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.319
MITCHELL: Try to say
something, mate. Come on!

40:15.320 --> 40:16.720
Come on, mate. Ty?

40:17.720 --> 40:21.839
So he was hit hard enough
to be knocked over?

40:21.840 --> 40:24.200
Well, yeah. I guess so.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.000
No further questions, Your Honour.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.919
When the victim fell,

40:34.920 --> 40:37.000
did you hear the accused say anything?

40:38.040 --> 40:40.319
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"

40:40.320 --> 40:41.999
and when Ty didn't get back up,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.880
he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".

40:44.880 --> 40:46.879
He kept saying it.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.805
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.479
So, it's possible the
blow wasn't hard enough

40:52.480 --> 40:53.919
to make the victim fall?

40:53.920 --> 40:55.800
Yeah, maybe. Only a...

40:58.640 --> 41:00.920
Only what, Mr Metcalf?

41:03.240 --> 41:05.920
Only I just remembered
Tyler didn't trip.

41:06.640 --> 41:07.999
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

41:08.000 --> 41:09.359
He was lunging forward at the time,

41:09.360 --> 41:10.840
trying to grab the phone
with the pictures.

41:19.713 --> 41:23.165
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine? What's-her-face? Anyone?

41:25.640 --> 41:27.519
Look, what if I talk to 'em?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.119
The NCC?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.319
I don't think it'd
make a difference now.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.200
So, what's the plan from here?

41:35.840 --> 41:38.719
I think Richard's going to
call Nate as a witness.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.439
What?

41:40.440 --> 41:42.159
It's a chance for the
judge to hear first-hand

41:42.160 --> 41:43.959
your relationship with the victim.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.799
And risk us trapping him into
saying something he shouldn't?

41:46.800 --> 41:49.199
Why you'd never have laid
into him with full force.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.759
I thought you said you
don't normally do that?

41:50.760 --> 41:52.439
Well, he's got nothing else.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.039
We've got no choice.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.759
And I think you could
really help yourself.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.719
And you know Richard. Never
say die. He'll find some angle.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.199
He'll try and counter
Nate's public image.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.279
It'll all be about tearing down
the aggro and the thuggery

42:04.280 --> 42:06.159
and showing his warm, caring side.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.519
Yeah, good luck with that.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.039
Well, this is Richard.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.880
Whatever he's got will be
carefully thought-out.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.560
You think he's still got a chance?

42:15.640 --> 42:17.559
It's still Nate Baldwin.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.280
If we get him angry,
he'll undo everything.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.199
MAXINE: What the fuck do you
mean you don't have it?

42:28.200 --> 42:30.519
FLYNN: I mean it was for sale,
and now it's been sold.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.279
Who to? Was it Eddie?

42:32.280 --> 42:34.120
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.199
It was a private sale.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.719
Do you know you have had me
running all around town.

42:38.720 --> 42:43.679
I have grabbed cash every way I
know how because we had a deal.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.640
Now tell me who the
hell has the drug now!

42:47.920 --> 42:49.160
No.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.400
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.

42:54.600 --> 42:55.720
You're dead.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.160
(DOOR SLAMS)

43:12.280 --> 43:14.639
So, according to your expert analysis

43:14.640 --> 43:17.519
of the deceased's autopsy
and toxicology report,

43:17.520 --> 43:20.959
could you explain for the court
what the cause of death was?

43:20.960 --> 43:22.840
A subdural haematoma.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.559
That is, bleeding which fills
the brain area rapidly,

43:26.560 --> 43:28.400
compressing brain tissue.

43:29.880 --> 43:32.119
And what caused that haematoma?

43:32.120 --> 43:33.720
A serious blow to the head.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.519
A large contusion on
the side of the face

43:36.520 --> 43:38.560
corresponded to where the
deceased was struck.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.760
And that was the only
cause of the bleeding?

43:44.400 --> 43:46.639
There were some anomalies in the reports

43:46.640 --> 43:48.599
regarding the failure
of the deceased's blood

43:48.600 --> 43:50.279
to coagulate properly.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.679
The cause of that was not
possible to determine.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.919
Was it a contributing factor
to the death of Mr Perati?

43:55.920 --> 43:59.680
I couldn't categorically state that, no.

44:01.730 --> 44:02.970
Nothing further.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.559
EDDIE: I think this might
be able to help you.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.279
ZOE: Thanks.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.439
2ml daily, top thigh.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.319
Four or five days should do the trick.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.079
And there's no chance
of it testing positive?

44:15.080 --> 44:16.599
Lots of guys were on it last year.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.999
Passed everything.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.119
Well, in that case, when
Greta wins a medal,

44:20.120 --> 44:21.320
we'll know who to thank.

44:22.280 --> 44:23.599
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.279
We need this tested as soon as possible.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.520
We have to be sure it's the
substance that killed Tyler.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.640
- JUDGE WALKER: Your witness, Mr Stirling.
- -

44:38.840 --> 44:41.200
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?

44:42.360 --> 44:43.720
Mr Stirling!

44:49.160 --> 44:51.599
Your Honour, I wish to
apply for an adjournment,

44:51.600 --> 44:55.519
because my instructions
have been compromised.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.360
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?

44:59.480 --> 45:01.999
My client has...

45:02.000 --> 45:05.360
said something that is
difficult to interpret.

45:07.600 --> 45:10.719
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?

45:10.720 --> 45:12.799
Your Honour, I've
received mixed messages

45:12.800 --> 45:14.559
and need a private
audience with my client

45:14.560 --> 45:16.159
to confirm his instructions.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.119
If we could adjourn for
the rest of the day...

45:18.120 --> 45:20.399
Your Honour, my learned
colleague only needs a minute

45:20.400 --> 45:22.279
to ask his client what he meant.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.439
A couple of hours to
advise my client calmly,

45:24.440 --> 45:26.359
ensure he understands the
entirely of the situation

45:26.360 --> 45:28.399
is not unreasonable.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.879
There are a lot of grey
areas in this case.

45:31.880 --> 45:36.120
Including the hairs you're
putting on my head, Mr Stirling.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.839
You have an hour.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.319
So I get the cash together,

45:40.320 --> 45:42.639
I go there and then he says
he doesn't have it anymore.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.079
I just don't know what to do.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.999
So how's it looking your end, Richard?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.919
Sorry, gotta go.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.360
Oh, shit.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.919
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.039
If it's not here in 20 minutes,
I've got to put Nate on the stand.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.399
Well, you can stretch that out.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.399
Go back to his childhood,
his love for the game.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.719
You used to hate it when the defence
resorted to sob stories for a win.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.760
Well, there's an exception
for everything.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.240
Good luck.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.879
NATE: I met Tyler a couple of years ago.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.839
He'd just been spotted
in a schoolboys' team

46:14.840 --> 46:18.279
and he got into a clinic the Devils
run for up-and-coming players.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.479
I gave him some tips.

46:20.480 --> 46:24.439
I could tell how keen he was, you
know, that hunger to make it.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.239
Anyway, he got signed on and,
yeah, we hung out a bit.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.439
You mentor a lot of younger players.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.119
What made Tyler special?

46:32.120 --> 46:34.119
He told me he didn't
have a dad, so I, um...

46:34.120 --> 46:36.079
you know, I just...

46:36.080 --> 46:38.320
I looked out for him, gave him advice.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.119
He never really talked about it,

46:41.120 --> 46:44.599
but I could tell the pressure that
he was under to make first grade

46:44.600 --> 46:46.159
'cause of what that
meant for his family.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.160
The money.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.039
I knew they were doing it tough

46:50.040 --> 46:52.359
and, you know, they counted
on him to take care of them.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.000
You're successful, wealthy.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.519
How could you really
know what that was like?

46:57.520 --> 46:59.240
Well, I know that pressure.

47:00.600 --> 47:05.119
An injury or something can
end your career in a flash

47:05.120 --> 47:08.000
and suddenly... suddenly
you've got nothin'.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.799
So, you've gotta work your guts out
to stay at the top of your form.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.919
I know how much training
and sacrifice that takes.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.160
I've lived it.

47:17.480 --> 47:18.720
I saw Ty live it.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.599
I knew exactly what he wanted,

47:22.600 --> 47:24.119
'cause it's what I've always wanted

47:24.120 --> 47:26.239
and I would never, ever
have done anything

47:26.240 --> 47:27.800
to take that away from him.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.719
BEN: So you had a real
connection with him?

47:39.720 --> 47:40.920
What?

47:40.921 --> 47:42.679
Well, you and Tyler.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.120
You obviously had a common bond.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.279
We were good mates, yeah.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.560
I mean, it sounded a lot
more than that to me.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.919
I'd imagine you get to know your
fellow teammates pretty well

47:54.920 --> 47:56.359
in that locker room...

47:56.360 --> 47:58.239
Objection, Your Honour. Relevance.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.479
Your Honour, I'm merely
wanting to establish

48:00.480 --> 48:02.959
the intimate bonds of male teammates,

48:02.960 --> 48:05.719
which some may describe as homoerotic.

48:05.720 --> 48:06.760
Homo what?

48:06.761 --> 48:09.039
And the bond between Nate
Baldwin and Tyler Perati,

48:09.040 --> 48:10.599
which was clearly on
and off the field...

48:10.600 --> 48:12.319
Hey, fuck off! It wasn't like that!

48:12.320 --> 48:14.799
I'm not gay. You can't... you
can't say that shit to me!

48:14.800 --> 48:17.599
Objection. This is assuming a fact
not in evidence, Your Honour.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.800
No, look, I'm just saying

48:18.801 --> 48:20.559
you've got no right to
imply something like that.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.280
Sustained. Thank you, Mr Crown.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.199
Withdrawn, Your Honour.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.039
I did nothin'...wrong.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.640
I didn't even hit him that hard.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.240
I know I didn't.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.360
Hey. News?

48:41.361 --> 48:43.480
The lab's just emailed the results.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.040
Oh, what?

48:48.280 --> 48:49.480
What's happening?

48:50.520 --> 48:52.199
H2O.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.021
- It was water.
- What?

48:54.114 --> 48:56.554
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.160
But he thought it was the
real thing, didn't he?

49:02.800 --> 49:04.879
CINDI: Aren't you going to
cop shit for nicking this?

49:04.880 --> 49:07.279
What if Flynn finds out
you swapped it for water?

49:07.280 --> 49:09.119
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.000
Serves 'em both right.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.119
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.999
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.239
What is it?

49:17.240 --> 49:18.320
Who cares?

49:18.321 --> 49:20.160
I found someone to buy it,
that's all that matters.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.439
When's he comin'?

49:22.440 --> 49:23.599
Soon.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.600
And if he doesn't turn up,

49:24.601 --> 49:26.599
there's plenty of other
contacts in Flynn's phone.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.960
And we can pay off your
debt and you'll be sweet.

49:29.960 --> 49:33.719
We could, like, get our own place
and stuff, just you and me.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.519
Fuck, it'd be so cool.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.399
Hey, what are you doing?

49:37.400 --> 49:38.799
It's a 20,000 trip.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.759
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.679
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, it'd be stupid not to!

49:42.680 --> 49:44.799
Cindi, for fuck's sake! No,
I need that money. Stop!

49:44.800 --> 49:46.240
Look, he won't even notice.

49:48.960 --> 49:50.480
(COUGHS AND LAUGHS)

49:53.720 --> 49:55.160
Mr Baldwin.

49:57.640 --> 50:01.520
The emotional impact of your
evidence was considerable.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.559
The bond you shared with the victim

50:04.560 --> 50:07.599
was obviously deeply felt and genuine.

50:07.600 --> 50:11.559
Your role as a mentor and
father-figure in his life

50:11.560 --> 50:13.200
is without question.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.360
However, the strength
of your relationship...

50:18.520 --> 50:20.439
cannot alter the facts

50:20.440 --> 50:23.919
presented by the autopsy
and toxicology reports.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.279
The large bruise on the deceased's body

50:27.280 --> 50:31.559
directly corresponds with the
blow with which you struck him,

50:31.560 --> 50:35.800
and the size of the bruise
indicates the force behind it.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.839
I find no other contributing
factors to his death,

50:40.840 --> 50:43.279
other than the punch,

50:43.280 --> 50:46.479
and so on one count of manslaughter,

50:46.480 --> 50:48.120
I find you guilty.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.600
Sentencing to take place at
a date to be determined.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.960
Please remove the prisoner.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.160
(CAMERAS CLICK)

52:03.360 --> 52:05.919
Okay, although I usually
don't comment on verdicts,

52:05.920 --> 52:09.719
I am aware of recent public concern
about decisions made by the DPP.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.879
I have no doubt today's outcome

52:11.880 --> 52:14.039
will restore public
confidence in the DPP

52:14.040 --> 52:15.839
and I would especially
like to acknowledge

52:15.840 --> 52:17.479
the team responsible for preparing

52:17.480 --> 52:19.759
such a strong case to present to court,

52:19.760 --> 52:21.200
led by Ben McMahon.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.119
Maybe it was Flynn.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.839
Maybe he swapped the
real drug for water.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.159
But he's been pissed off all day,

52:40.160 --> 52:41.799
because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.399
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?

52:44.400 --> 52:46.359
Like, an accident. It was unlabelled.

52:46.360 --> 52:49.720
After he went to so much trouble
to get it for her? It's unlikely.

52:52.200 --> 52:54.199
Was Eddie onto us?

52:54.200 --> 52:55.720
Is that possible?

53:01.120 --> 53:03.839
Then, why go through the whole
charade of giving her anything?

53:03.840 --> 53:05.919
Why not just say no the first
time she asked for it?

53:05.920 --> 53:07.240
He's an arrogant bastard?

53:12.200 --> 53:15.240
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?

53:23.440 --> 53:28.280
And if he was, how involved
is he in the whole thing?

53:49.240 --> 53:51.840
- (CRASH!)
- (TYRES SCREECH, GLASS SHATTERS)

53:53.360 --> 53:55.200
Does all this link back to Eddie?

53:58.760 --> 54:00.279
Help, somebody!

54:00.280 --> 54:02.360
Please help! You're all right. Come on.

54:04.280 --> 54:07.000
Help, somebody! Help!

54:08.120 --> 54:11.040
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

54:12.600 --> 54:14.680
Somebody, come on, help us!

54:23.920 --> 54:27.439
That bottle is a critical piece of
evidence in a national investigation.

54:27.440 --> 54:29.719
Now, if you want to get
arrested, fine, run off.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.159
If not, just give it to me!

54:31.160 --> 54:33.159
I could be in here for
12 years! I can't do it.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.599
I've gotta spill my guts to the
NCC. That'll knock some time off.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.799
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.679
Could Maxine be the head
of the whole syndicate?

54:40.680 --> 54:43.039
Well, that would mean she's
let her own client go to jail

54:43.040 --> 54:45.039
over a drug that propped
up her betting plunges.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.440
Interesting business model.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.040
We're too late.
