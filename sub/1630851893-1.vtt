00:09.134 --> 00:11.094
In the years of the Civil War,

00:11.178 --> 00:13.931
Emily Dickinson reached
her greatest heights as a poet.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.683
She wrote furiously in those years,

00:16.767 --> 00:20.103
at a pace and intensity
unmatched before or after--

00:20.187 --> 00:21.605
nearly a poem a day.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.690
Her work of this period has been called

00:23.774 --> 00:27.152
"a great and classic descent
into a personal inferno."

00:27.694 --> 00:29.821
Yet, due to her life of seclusion,

00:29.905 --> 00:32.908
Dickinson has not traditionally
been considered a "war poet."

00:33.575 --> 00:35.619
Most people do not think
of Emily Dickinson

00:35.702 --> 00:39.581
as a voice with the power
to speak for a nation.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.339
Over here!

01:44.313 --> 01:46.857
The kingdom's on fire
The blood of a young messiah

01:46.940 --> 01:49.610
I see sinners in a church
I see sinners in a church

01:49.693 --> 01:51.987
Sometimes I might be introvert

01:52.070 --> 01:54.656
There's a war inside
I hear battle cries

01:54.740 --> 01:57.075
Mothers burying sons
Young boys playing with guns

01:57.159 --> 01:59.703
The devil's a liar
Fulfill your wildest desires

02:11.757 --> 02:13.675
Alone, but not lonely

02:14.343 --> 02:16.762
Your truth unveils with time

02:19.473 --> 02:24.770
As you embark on a journey
Of what it takes to be a woman

02:41.870 --> 02:46.083
Yes, fondly do we hope,
and fervently do we pray,

02:46.166 --> 02:50.212
that this scourge of war
may pass speedily away.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.757
Yet the Almighty has his own purposes,

02:53.841 --> 02:58.262
and the judgments of the Lord are
always true and righteous.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.430
So let us strive on.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.809
Let us bind up this nation's wounds.

03:03.892 --> 03:09.606
And let us mourn this brave young man
who gave his life for this country.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.108
Excuse me.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.235
Brave young man?

03:13.318 --> 03:14.778
Yes. That's what I said.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.156
But this isn't a soldier.
This is my sister.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.616
I beg your pardon, madam?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.911
We're here for the funeral
of my beloved sister,

03:22.995 --> 03:25.664
Lavinia Norcross Norcross.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.790
She married our cousin.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.917
There must be some mistake.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.669
No, the mistake is yours, Reverend.

03:30.752 --> 03:35.048
Can we please carry on with the service
and bury our dead in a respectful manner?

03:35.132 --> 03:37.467
-I am terribly sorry.
-Yes.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.762
I have no more time
for the funeral of some old woman.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.850
There are 15 noble Union men
to bury today,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.853
valiant warriors who have sacrificed all

03:47.936 --> 03:49.897
-for the cause of the Constitution.
-Ah, ye--

03:49.980 --> 03:52.566
And I am running way behind schedule.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.864
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.949
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.827
For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever. Amen."

04:05.412 --> 04:06.747
Moving on.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.711
That was the shortest funeral
I've ever been to.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.922
It was awful. Just awful.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.507
And we came all the way to Boston.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.093
-I'm going to write a letter.
-My poor, beloved sister Lavinia.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.430
Aunt Vinnie.
I was named after you.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.265
Hey, everyone. Look.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.102
Bird is talking to us.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.938
Oh, Emily, please. Not now.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.692
Let's go fetch the carriage.
We have a long ride home.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.736
We don't want to get stuck
behind a parade.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.238
Another parade?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.950
Yes. All those boys
going off to join the fighting.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.993
Civil War ruins everything.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.288
Go on.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.624
Don't stop.

04:51.959 --> 04:52.960
Emily.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.421
Come fetch the carriage!

05:04.555 --> 05:06.723
Oh, God, we have so much to catch up on.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.934
Like this bird I just saw.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.229
This little bird just landed
on Aunt Lavinia's coffin.

05:12.312 --> 05:17.359
It was like… a symbol
or a metaphor.

05:18.026 --> 05:23.198
It was like a message from Aunt Lavinia
herself, telling me to keep writing,

05:23.282 --> 05:27.369
to keep shining a light in the darkness
and to never give up hope.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.707
Death, are--

05:33.083 --> 05:34.877
-Are you okay?
-No.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.920
I feel like shit.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.840
Oh, no. What's wrong?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.634
It's this damn war.

05:42.718 --> 05:46.388
It's just dragging on and on,
and it's taken all the fun out of my work.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.267
I used to have so much fun coming up with
creative ways to kill people.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.394
This person will fall off a bridge.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.105
This fool will drink a little poison.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.649
These two kill each other out of love.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.737
But now it's just the same thing
over and over again.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.031
Bullet, gangrene.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.575
Bullet, gangrene.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.202
It's so repetitive.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.663
I think I'm depressed.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.081
Wow.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.791
So even Death has bad days.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.168
Emily…

06:17.753 --> 06:19.880
-I need some advice.
-Advice?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.257
Yeah, that's what I'm here for.
I need your help.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.176
Okay, yes. Ask me-- Ask me anything.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.762
-So you write poems.
-Yep. That's right.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.055
Brilliant ones.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.348
-Unique ones.
-Thank you.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.974
Very inspired.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.102
Even though you live
a pretty uneventful life.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.313
Uneventful? I--

06:36.396 --> 06:38.232
I'm not sure that's the case.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.359
I mean, come on now.
Your life's pretty boring.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.694
You barely leave your little town.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.279
You still live in your dad's crib.

06:44.863 --> 06:48.075
Every day is pretty much the same,
but you still stay inspired.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.285
Where do you get that fire from?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.121
Well…

06:53.205 --> 06:54.498
while I'm here,

06:56.041 --> 06:58.085
I want to do something that matters.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.505
And I mean something that really matters.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.591
It's bigger than fame or money.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.344
It's about
actually changing people's lives.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.888
It's about helping them heal.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.515
Helping them survive.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.769
I want to be that little bird.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.314
That source of light in the darkness.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.316
I want to give people hope.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.277
Hope.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.446
I believe poetry can be powerful.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.948
Even more powerful than you.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.118
I mean it.

07:31.201 --> 07:35.080
Death can tear people apart.
Poetry can put them back together again.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.125
So what you're saying is…

07:38.876 --> 07:40.586
I inspire you.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
Always.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.723
Home again, home again.
Thank God we're home again.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.308
It was a lovely funeral.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.476
It was not. Stop gaslighting me.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.937
It was a fiasco. Your mother's right.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.398
I've been more ceremonious
while swatting a fly.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.901
What the minister said doesn't matter.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.278
I could feel Aunt Lavinia's spirit there.
I could.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.447
I could-- I could feel it.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.992
Mom, you know
she always told us to find the light.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.246
Right? And to move towards joy and hope.

08:16.955 --> 08:17.956
Hope.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.791
I need a pencil.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.295
If Aunt Lavinia's spirit was there,
why didn't she contact me?

08:23.378 --> 08:24.796
Emily, don't upset your mother.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.174
I'm not.
I'm just trying to help. Mom…

08:27.257 --> 08:28.717
Where the hell was Austin?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.053
-Can't make it to the funeral of his aunt?
-Hope is…

08:31.136 --> 08:33.931
-Hope is a Bird… No, that's…
-It's disrespectful.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.643
It's embarrassing. I could hear those
Boston gossips whispering to each other.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.809
He's let us down again.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.102
-Leave him alone, Edward.
-No.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.023
I won't lower my expectations for my son.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.358
-Someone's here.
-I'll get it.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.486
His behavior is getting worse and worse.
He's drinking all the time.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.987
-I can't bear it.
-It is what it is.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.698
No. I will not stand by
and watch this boy disintegrate.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.492
-Especially when, as we all know…
-Sue.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.077
…his wife is about to have a baby.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.955
Waddled over here like a bloody walrus.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.706
You're a cute walrus.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.458
Come in.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.919
-Emily, who's here?
-It's Sue.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.255
Oh, nice of her to show up.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.714
How was the funeral?

09:07.798 --> 09:10.801
Horrendous, Sue.
And so kind of you to make it.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.680
I was ready to go this morning.
Your carriage never came to get me.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.683
We assumed that you'd be taking
your own carriage with Austin.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.102
Well, Austin arrived home late last night.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.563
And this morning, he was indisposed.

09:22.646 --> 09:23.689
Unacceptable.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.649
I'm-- I'm very sorry to have missed it.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.984
Oh, thank you, Sue.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.112
I didn't know Aunt Lavinia that well,
but I-- I always admired her.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.948
Everyone did. She was iconic.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.116
How are you feeling, Sue?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.743
You look as though you're ready to pop.

09:36.827 --> 09:40.330
Yeah, I'm definitely at the point
where this isn't fun anymore.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.666
Can I get you something? Water? Any--

09:42.749 --> 09:45.210
I'd actually love to lie down.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.754
I know it's a short walk
between our two houses,

09:47.838 --> 09:49.339
but I feel like I climbed a mountain.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.134
I'm sure. Well, let's get you upstairs
so you can rest.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.802
-Yeah.
-No, that's rude.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.180
You both need to stay down here
and say hello to our guests.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.264
Well, I really--

09:57.347 --> 10:00.225
She'll just rest for a little bit,
and we'll be ready to entertain.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.312
She's missed the funeral. The least
she can do is be here for the reception.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.355
I'd say the same of Austin,
but where the hell is he?

10:05.439 --> 10:06.732
Edward, it is a woman's job

10:06.815 --> 10:09.526
to make sure everybody else is happy
at all times no matter the cost.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.486
I'm sorry,
but that simply doesn't apply to men.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.155
Sue has every right to feel tired.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.116
-Just look at her.
-I don't care if she's the size of Kansas.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.576
Thanks.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.828
Oh, come on. Everybody loves Kansas.

10:19.912 --> 10:20.954
It just became a state.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.749
I'll take you upstairs. We'll rest a li--
Mom, I'll be right back.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.083
Let's just get you…

10:26.168 --> 10:27.336
How was the funeral?

10:27.419 --> 10:30.130
Oh, God.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.935
I can't stay long, okay?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.728
My mom really needs me.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.397
Well, I need you too.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.151
It's hard to believe
we used to fit into this tiny bed.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.989
-Well, now there are three of us.
-Almost.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.290
Sue, Sue…

11:14.132 --> 11:16.510
You know I really want
to make out with you right now?

11:17.511 --> 11:21.348
But… you're having my brother's baby.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.183
So what? That doesn't change anything.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.351
I only love you.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.187
Look, it-- It was an accident.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.566
-It was stupid. It never even would've--
-No. I don't even want to know.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.193
Emily, listen to me.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.321
I love you.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.992
I will always love you.

11:41.785 --> 11:46.331
And this baby is going to love you too.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.587
Pregnancy makes you hotter.
It's kind of messed up.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.423
Do you feel this?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.140
Wow.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.144
It's a whole little person in there.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.897
Coming so soon.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.609
Are you scared?

12:13.692 --> 12:16.403
No. Not at all.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.031
This whole time I've been pregnant,

12:19.114 --> 12:22.534
I have just felt this--
this strange sense of peace.

12:22.618 --> 12:23.869
Peace?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.206
In the middle of a war?

12:27.289 --> 12:29.791
I'm honestly as happy as I've ever been.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.963
Except I wish this baby was yours.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.257
I mean, I--

12:38.509 --> 12:40.511
I wish it belonged to you and me,
together.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.970
Why can't a baby have two mothers?

12:44.056 --> 12:49.269
I would like to live
in a little house, just us,

12:49.353 --> 12:51.480
and raise this baby together.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.982
Well, I never wanted children.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.945
I mean, I already have so many.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.863
My poems are my children.

13:01.281 --> 13:05.369
Boy, do they take all the energy I have,
feeding them, helping them grow.

13:06.078 --> 13:09.998
I got a whole burst of poetry
at Aunt Lavinia's funeral today.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.918
I've got to write this down.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.924
Hope, hope. Hope is a… Hope is a Bird…

13:22.010 --> 13:24.763
Hope is a… a little Thing.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.642
I hope this baby comes soon.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.522
I suppose you won't have as much time
for my poems once the baby comes.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.899
Emily, that isn't true.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.945
I will always have time for your poems.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.489
I promise.

13:42.573 --> 13:46.660
Well, in that case, I guess I can try
and make a little time for your baby.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.704
Oh, would you?

13:48.787 --> 13:51.039
Just-- Just a little?

13:52.416 --> 13:54.751
I just hope this kid looks like you
and not Austin.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.837
Hey, everyone. I'm home.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.423
-Oh, God. He's here.
-Welcome home, Mr. Austin.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.799
I cannot deal with him.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.844
I should probably go downstairs.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.929
Would you just--

14:07.431 --> 14:09.183
Won't you come and kiss me, please?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.316
Mom. I'm sorry.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.819
-Austin, where were you?
-I overslept. I'm an asshole.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.487
But I got you flowers.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.866
Well, I forgive you,
and I still love you unconditionally.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.286
Austin, could you join me in my office?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.871
Yeah, I guess so.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.540
But, Dad, keep in mind
my head is killing me.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.876
Maggie, please put these in some water.

14:36.585 --> 14:39.838
-Quite a loud bouquet, isn't it?
-Oh, yes. So thoughtful of him.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.591
I may have lost a sister,
but I still have a perfect son.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.387
I'm going to be honest with you, Austin.
I'm troubled.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.474
I'm deeply troubled.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.978
Stomach problems again? You got the runs?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.980
Could you be serious for a moment, please?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.815
Diarrhea is pretty serious, Dad.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.194
Austin, I don't want to turn this into
another scuffle between us.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.656
But I need you to understand
that I'm frightened.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.743
No, your behavior. My God, man.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.329
The-- The drinking, the womanizing…

15:12.955 --> 15:16.166
I'm watching you turn into my father
in his darkest days.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.334
Look, look.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.046
I understand sometimes
a man needs to blow off a little steam.

15:22.214 --> 15:26.385
I've even had fun once or twice myself.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.136
But your situation--

15:29.096 --> 15:30.556
You're not a child anymore.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.267
Austin, you're about to become a father.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.397
I don't even know if that baby's mine.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.324
-Dad, are you okay?
-Yes.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.159
I'm fine, Emily. I'm fine.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.331
It's nothing.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.000
-There's someone here.
-Okay.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.209
It's nothing.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.878
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.927
Betty! Welcome. Come in.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.263
I brought
your mother's new funeral bonnet.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.849
She'll be happy to hear that.

16:13.932 --> 16:19.062
Or not happy, but whatever the appropriate
emotion for a funeral bonnet is.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.649
It has the weeping veil attached,
as she requested.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.027
I'm sorry it's a few days late.

16:25.110 --> 16:29.031
There's been such a run on black crepe.
Widows everywhere these days.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.076
I swear I can't remember what it's like
when a woman just looks happy.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.162
I feel pretty happy today.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.915
Which I know is strange.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.708
Didn't you just bury your aunt?

16:41.210 --> 16:42.211
Yeah.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.755
Yeah, but that's-- That's the thing.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.800
See, I felt like I connected
to Aunt Lavinia at the graveyard.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.552
Like she was sending me a message.

16:50.636 --> 16:55.265
And that message was,
"Be cheerful. Give people hope."

16:57.226 --> 16:58.477
That is strange.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.686
I know.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.691
Have you heard any word lately from Henry?

17:04.775 --> 17:06.609
No. Not for weeks.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.445
-But he writes to you so faithfully--
-To Helen.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.075
He writes to Helen.
And it means everything to her.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.743
But it's been a month without a word.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.496
Helen is beside herself.

17:17.579 --> 17:21.583
I almost want to write her a letter myself
and pretend it's from Henry,

17:22.291 --> 17:24.752
just so she doesn't cry herself to sleep
every night.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.172
Betty, listen to me.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.049
Henry will be okay.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.095
He'll survive. Okay?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.471
Another letter will come.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.808
Brighter days are on the horizon,
I'm telling you.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.060
We must keep hope alive.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.315
I thought poets
were supposed to avoid clichés.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.777
Now, shall I deliver this to your mother?

17:48.861 --> 17:50.779
Yes, she's just in the kitchen.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.366
It's time to bring the tea cakes
into the parlor, Mrs. D.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.828
Yes. And the spoons need polishing.
The spoons!

17:58.412 --> 18:00.873
She's not responding
to the urgency of the situation.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.834
Mom, Betty's here.
She brought your new bonnet.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.295
Who cares about bonnets?

18:06.378 --> 18:08.922
Wow. She's in bad shape.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.883
I'm in despair.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.177
I'm in abject, bottomless despair.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.304
You still have a bottom, madam.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.431
And you need to get it out of that chair.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.557
Mom. Listen to me.

18:19.391 --> 18:23.187
Aunt Lavinia always told us we have to do
what we love, and you love serving tea.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.022
-No one's gonna show up.
-That's not true.

18:25.606 --> 18:26.899
Why should they come?

18:26.982 --> 18:29.443
What meaning can the death
of an older lady have

18:29.526 --> 18:31.778
when brave young men
are perishing every minute?

18:31.862 --> 18:34.114
Okay, they might not care
about Aunt Lavinia.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.701
But I told them all
that there would be scones.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.423
We're here.

18:51.507 --> 18:52.716
Where's the coffin?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.635
Come on in. Here.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.262
More bad news today from Virginia.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.389
They sunk two Union warships.

19:00.057 --> 19:02.809
I can't even read the news
anymore, I swear to God.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.646
This war just does not end.

19:05.729 --> 19:09.358
I know. It's, like,
when do we get to go back to normal?

19:09.441 --> 19:11.777
I'm afraid we may never go back to normal.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.530
Or perhaps this is normal now.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.365
A new normal.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.742
Yeah. This normal sucks.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.537
So, it's been two years
since my husband died,

19:21.620 --> 19:24.456
so I think my deep mourning phase
is, like, over.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.709
So I need to replace all my grays
and black with some color.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.627
What do you think?

19:28.710 --> 19:30.462
If you're asking me to make you a dress,

19:30.546 --> 19:32.923
you should know
I won't get to your order for weeks.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.259
-I'm so backed up at the shop.
-I figured.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.135
Everybody needs mourning clothes.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.763
Yep. Business is booming.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.349
This whole war just came out of nowhere.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.269
I'm not sure about that. It was pretty
clear we were headed in a bad direction.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.979
Yeah, duh.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.022
Since, like, the founding of the country.

19:49.106 --> 19:52.901
I just don't understand
why this has to be happening in our 20s.

19:52.985 --> 19:54.403
We could be having so much fun.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.487
Yes, it's true.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.407
My God, if this would have happened
to me in my 20s…

19:59.491 --> 20:00.951
I would have killed myself.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.914
It's always the hot ones who die.
Do you notice that?

20:05.998 --> 20:08.876
Like, can't the Lord
take someone I'm not attracted to?

20:12.796 --> 20:14.673
Vinnie, that reminds me.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.091
Super sad news.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.260
-What's up?
-Joseph Lyman is dead.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.934
Sorry, what?

20:26.018 --> 20:29.188
I was at the general store,
and someone got a telegram about it.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.940
I guess he got shot
in a battle down in New Orleans.

20:32.024 --> 20:35.736
But Joseph Lyman?
Gone from this world forever?

20:36.612 --> 20:39.281
Oh, God, this can't be true.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.867
Jane, I loved him.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.994
Babe, I get it.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.787
-I'm a widow.
-No.

20:46.580 --> 20:50.042
I am a widow.
A widow a thousand times over.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.921
Ship is gone and now Joseph too?

20:54.004 --> 20:57.966
Do you guys realize
every boy I ever kissed is dead?

20:58.050 --> 20:59.760
You did more than kiss them, honey.

21:05.599 --> 21:06.850
Mom?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.647
What's wrong, Mom? Can I help?

21:13.148 --> 21:14.483
It's just as I predicted.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.401
Nobody came.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.487
What? The house is filled with people.

21:19.196 --> 21:22.157
Those are just your friends.
They're not mine.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.659
They're not Aunt Vinnie's.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.495
The world we grew up in, it's lost.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.288
And nobody will have remembered my sister.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.836
Are those the beautiful Dickinson ladies
I see?

21:35.629 --> 21:38.257
Mr. Conkey. You came.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.466
Yes, I did.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.718
Oh, it's so lovely to see you, Ithamar.

21:41.802 --> 21:45.639
And so kind of you to come, to share
in the dreadful loss of our dear Lavinia.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.268
Well, as a matter of fact,

21:49.351 --> 21:51.395
I'm actually here to see Emily.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.063
-Me?
-That's right.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.067
Is there someplace
the two of us might converse in private?

21:57.150 --> 21:58.777
I'd…

22:00.988 --> 22:02.072
What?

22:02.155 --> 22:04.867
I suppose you could go out
on the side porch.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.494
Perfect. Ideal. Shall we?

22:09.371 --> 22:10.372
Go ahead.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.422
And my condolences, of course.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.889
Hey.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.099
Austin, we can't.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.727
Everyone knows.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.730
Come on, Jane. Just kiss me.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.273
No, it's unseemly.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.442
Your wife is about to burst.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.278
Sue doesn't care.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.573
Well, I do. Think of your child.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.992
I'm thinking of my godson.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.077
Did Billy like the rocking horse I sent?

22:49.912 --> 22:51.121
He loved it.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.833
Well, then I'll come by this evening
and see him ride it.

22:56.251 --> 22:59.505
No. We can't-- We can't do this anymore.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.798
Jane, come on.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.800
You know Sue and I don't love each other.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.386
Yeah. Well, you still managed
to get her pregnant.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.933
-Sue!
-Hello, Jane.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.601
How are you feeling?

23:13.310 --> 23:16.188
I'm all right. I'll be feeling
much better when this baby comes out.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.524
Should be any day now.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.776
Any day now.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.824
I'll see you tonight.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.244
No, you won't.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.474
-Evelina.
-Emily.

23:52.558 --> 23:56.228
Yes. I know how long you've waited for us
to be able to have this conversation.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.312
Of course, I--

23:57.396 --> 23:59.356
I wanted to be respectful of your aunt.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.191
Sure.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.987
But now, I can finally come to you
in the full light of the sun

24:05.070 --> 24:06.905
and express to you…

24:08.407 --> 24:09.658
my hope.

24:10.409 --> 24:13.662
Your hope for what?

24:13.745 --> 24:18.375
My dear Ev-- Emily,
you must know how I admire you.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.628
I actually was not aware.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.339
You are such a bright little spirit.

24:24.423 --> 24:29.595
Such a wholesome, loving daughter
who flutters around her nest,

24:29.678 --> 24:33.891
chirping her sweet song
and making everybody smile.

24:35.601 --> 24:39.271
Pretty sure nobody has ever described me
that way, but okay, I'll take it.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.023
Yes, you are.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.858
You are a loving songbird.

24:42.941 --> 24:47.571
And that is why I would be made so happy
if you were to… join me

24:47.654 --> 24:50.073
in my empty nest.

24:52.618 --> 24:56.038
-Oh, no, no, don't! You really--
-No. I can do it, despite my bad knees.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.457
Emily, my little parakeet.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.126
Marry me?

25:02.503 --> 25:04.213
I-- I don't--

25:04.296 --> 25:06.340
Oh, I know how long you've waited.

25:06.423 --> 25:07.508
You've grown old.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.760
Me, old? You're old.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.887
No, for a man,
I'm actually still quite young.

25:11.970 --> 25:15.641
You, on the other hand,
are elderly and frail, for a girl.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.811
But I believe there is still life
in that sweet heart of yours.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.148
Tweet for me, little bird.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.775
Mr. Conkey, please get up.

25:25.317 --> 25:26.318
Thank you.

25:28.278 --> 25:29.738
I really was in quite a lot of pain.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.574
I'm not gonna marry you.

25:32.658 --> 25:33.742
Say it again?

25:33.825 --> 25:35.536
I'm not gonna marry you!

25:39.748 --> 25:40.582
Why not?

25:43.126 --> 25:44.378
Well, because…

25:46.004 --> 25:47.005
I can't.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.844
I need to be here for my family.

25:53.345 --> 25:58.267
Things are so dark and terrible
with the war and losing Aunt Lavinia.

26:00.853 --> 26:03.647
They need me here. They really do.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.569
So then I have no hope.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.449
"'Hope'" is the thing with feathers" -

26:14.533 --> 26:17.995
-I don't know what that means.
-I'm not totally sure myself.

26:18.078 --> 26:20.956
-Excuse me. Sorry to intrude.
-Yes, go away.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.541
You're not intruding. Please.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.002
It's just, I'm leaving shortly,

26:25.085 --> 26:29.381
and, Emily, we still haven't gotten a
chance to discuss your new funeral bonnet.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.466
Betty, I didn't-- I--

26:31.550 --> 26:33.886
My-- My new-- My new bonnet!

26:33.969 --> 26:37.556
Oh, that's-- That's right! I--
Well, that's rather urgent, isn't it?

26:37.639 --> 26:40.058
Mr. Conkey, if you'll excuse me.
It's women's business.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.477
-You wouldn't understand.
-What? I can't hear you at all.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.271
Got to go! Later!

26:48.066 --> 26:49.985
How did you know I needed you?

26:50.068 --> 26:51.236
I know what happens

26:51.320 --> 26:54.198
when Ithamar Conkey
takes a young lady out on a porch.

26:54.281 --> 26:58.243
-So you think I'm young? Wow.
-Yeah! Well, not that young.

26:59.536 --> 27:03.040
Right. I'm a bona fide spinster.
Single AF.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.211
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

27:09.087 --> 27:12.799
I'm telling you, Henry will write.

27:13.509 --> 27:14.593
Don't give up.

27:31.318 --> 27:32.319
Whoa!

27:32.945 --> 27:34.154
Come on, now.

27:35.781 --> 27:36.782
Hyah!

28:00.264 --> 28:01.265
Is that way south?

28:01.849 --> 28:04.226
You're gonna want to go that way.

28:04.309 --> 28:05.352
That's south?

28:05.978 --> 28:09.273
But I just came from there.
I'm trying to go south.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.692
Well, what would you want to do that for?

28:13.277 --> 28:14.444
Thanks.

28:32.713 --> 28:35.132
Austin, would you pass me the carrots?

28:40.470 --> 28:42.514
This is our little secret,
don't tell anyone.

28:42.598 --> 28:43.932
Do you want to try a pea?

28:44.892 --> 28:46.810
Is that good?
Do you want to try another one?

28:46.894 --> 28:48.729
How many cats do you have now, Vin?

28:48.812 --> 28:50.022
So many.

28:50.856 --> 28:52.232
I might adopt a fox.

28:52.983 --> 28:54.401
It's chic.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.696
Family, if you please,

28:59.072 --> 29:00.073
a few words.

29:01.366 --> 29:06.580
This has been a sad day
in a string of sad days.

29:09.917 --> 29:13.212
And when this war began,
many thought it would be over quickly.

29:13.295 --> 29:18.759
And now we find ourselves years deep
into its darkness with no end in sight.

29:24.723 --> 29:29.520
Every society, in its own way,
is like a family.

29:30.604 --> 29:35.943
And it seems that our American family
can no longer tolerate each other.

29:36.693 --> 29:40.989
Can only see the bad in each other
and none of the good. 'Tis a pity.

29:41.073 --> 29:47.204
I don't know what the future holds
for this American family.

29:48.747 --> 29:50.999
But for the sake of all of us,

29:52.835 --> 29:56.129
especially for the sake of that little one
growing right now inside of Sue's belly,

29:56.213 --> 29:58.674
for his sake most of all,

30:00.092 --> 30:03.720
I hope that we can remember
to see the good in each other.

30:06.849 --> 30:11.812
And remember our duty.
To one another.

30:13.355 --> 30:16.400
That's all. That's all.

30:21.113 --> 30:24.408
-You know, it could be a girl.
-Oh, I hope so.

30:24.491 --> 30:25.826
Then we can name her Lavinia.

30:26.410 --> 30:27.536
Fun.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.288
Well, let's eat. Let's eat.

30:29.371 --> 30:30.706
Oh, no. Don't eat yet.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.958
I have something to say.

30:33.041 --> 30:36.795
Well, I hope it's about my sister, since
Edward failed to specifically mention her.

30:36.879 --> 30:40.299
Excuse me? I said it was a sad day.

30:40.382 --> 30:44.219
-What did you think I was referring to?
-Not a word. Not a loving memory.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.972
Don't blame me
for the fact the funeral was too short.

30:47.055 --> 30:49.391
Emily, please say something
about Aunt Lavinia.

30:49.474 --> 30:52.811
-I will, actually.
-I am kind of starving. Does anyone mind--

30:52.895 --> 30:56.064
Don't you dare touch that food
until Emily has finished with the eulogy.

30:58.108 --> 31:02.029
I have something I want to say
in honor of Aunt Lavinia.

31:05.282 --> 31:06.950
Dad, like you said,

31:07.951 --> 31:09.453
this is a very dark time.

31:10.245 --> 31:14.875
But I think it's a good time
to be sitting around this table together.

31:16.710 --> 31:21.006
Losing Aunt Lavinia has reminded me
how much I love this family.

31:21.840 --> 31:28.055
And just like how Aunt Lavinia
was such a source of joy and light,

31:28.138 --> 31:31.183
I want to be that for all of you.

31:32.184 --> 31:35.604
There is nothing that matters to me more
than the people gathered here tonight.

31:35.687 --> 31:40.692
And all I want to do is find a way
to keep hope alive for you.

31:42.402 --> 31:44.238
My dear, eloquent child.

31:44.321 --> 31:48.575
Emily, that was beautiful.

31:48.659 --> 31:49.826
Really sweet, Em.

31:49.910 --> 31:51.036
Wow.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.122
That was some bullshit.

31:54.790 --> 31:56.166
I beg your pardon?

31:56.250 --> 31:58.919
You know,
I expect this kind of garbage from him.

31:59.002 --> 32:01.171
But you, Emily?

32:02.381 --> 32:05.634
-I hold you to slightly higher standards.
-I meant every word I just said.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.178
"All I care about is the family"?

32:08.804 --> 32:10.848
-Yes.
-Are you kidding?

32:11.473 --> 32:12.850
This family is a joke.

32:12.933 --> 32:17.771
This family hates each other.
This family is a big pile of lies.

32:17.855 --> 32:19.982
Hell, my marriage is a lie.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.901
-But you know that, don't you, Emily?
-Austin, stop.

32:22.985 --> 32:24.736
He's drunk. Good. He's drunk again.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.488
So what?

32:26.572 --> 32:27.990
Why shouldn't I drink?

32:28.073 --> 32:30.951
Just like your dad did.
He was miserable too.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.995
All the Dickinsons
have always been miserable.

32:33.078 --> 32:35.038
You made sure of that, didn't you?

32:35.122 --> 32:36.248
Yeah.

32:36.331 --> 32:38.417
You wouldn't let me be happy.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.586
None of us could be happy, thanks to you.

32:41.128 --> 32:43.255
That's right. You kept us in cages.

32:43.338 --> 32:45.465
You clipped our wings.
You wouldn't let us fly!

32:45.549 --> 32:46.884
Austin, please.

32:47.509 --> 32:48.510
Lavinia…

32:49.803 --> 32:50.846
look at yourself.

32:50.929 --> 32:55.559
You're alone, unhappy, lost.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.812
-Just like Emily. Just like me.
-You need to stop.

32:58.896 --> 33:00.647
I had dreams too, you know?

33:01.231 --> 33:02.983
I wanted to go out west!

33:03.066 --> 33:04.151
You remember?

33:04.902 --> 33:07.362
But he wouldn't let me.

33:08.572 --> 33:09.781
I went west, all right.

33:09.865 --> 33:11.867
I went all the way
across the goddamn street.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.410
Austin, that is enough!

33:13.493 --> 33:15.662
Don't you speak to me like that!

33:15.746 --> 33:18.248
Don't you speak to me like a child!

33:18.332 --> 33:20.459
I am a man, goddamn it!

33:20.542 --> 33:24.129
I'm a broken, miserable man
in a broken, miserable country

33:24.213 --> 33:27.674
whose life was ruined
by his pathetic excuse for a father.

33:27.758 --> 33:28.967
You will stop this!

33:29.051 --> 33:31.261
You will stop thi--

33:31.345 --> 33:32.262
Dad?

33:35.557 --> 33:36.767
Oh, my God! Dad!

33:36.850 --> 33:39.853
Austin, you killed him. You killed Dad!

33:41.563 --> 33:44.733
Dad? Dad, are-- Can you hear me?

33:44.816 --> 33:46.193
Dad, are you alive?

33:46.276 --> 33:50.614
O say can you see

33:50.697 --> 33:52.241
Austin, get out of here!

33:52.324 --> 33:54.576
-By the dawn's early--
-Get out! Get out!

33:54.660 --> 33:57.829
You don't have to tell me to get out,
because I'm leaving.

33:57.913 --> 33:58.997
I secede.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.208
Do you hear that, Dad?

34:02.042 --> 34:03.710
I'm seceding from this family.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.260
Oh, he's still breathing.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.596
Okay. He's still breathing.
Don't give up, Dad.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.181
Oh, God.

34:25.482 --> 34:28.150
"Hope" is the thing with feathers -

34:30.445 --> 34:33.489
That perches in the soul -

34:34.533 --> 34:37.369
And sings the tune without the words -

34:38.829 --> 34:41.498
And never stops - at all -
