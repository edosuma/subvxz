HE'S OUT!

05:48.182 --> 05:49.183
I'LL GET YOU SOME MORE!

05:49.224 --> 05:53.061
OH, NO, NO, NO!

05:49.224 --> 05:53.061
I'LL GET IT.

05:49.224 --> 05:53.061
OKAY.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.522
OH, EXCUSE ME.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.522
DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.522
NO.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.732
PLEASE?

05:55.563 --> 05:57.732
I'M GOOD, PAMELA DE BARRES.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.068
WHEN DID YOU TURN ON MOMMY?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.068
WHAT? HE'S CUTE.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.361
AND, IF YOU LATCH ON NOW,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.361
YOU'RE TOTALLY ENTITLED

06:02.403 --> 06:05.157
TO HALF OF EVERYTHING WHEN HE

06:02.403 --> 06:05.157
DUMPS YOU AFTER HE'S FAMOUS.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.201
OKAY, UM, SINCE YOU

06:05.199 --> 06:07.201
DON'T NEED ANY HELP,

06:07.242 --> 06:10.204
SIMPLY A NEW PLACE TO LIVE,

06:07.242 --> 06:10.204
I'M GONNA JUST GO.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.955
LISTEN --

06:10.245 --> 06:11.955
YOU'RE BACK.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.955
OKAY, HI.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.999
WE'RE GONNA BE PLAYING

06:11.997 --> 06:13.999
A GIG NEXT MONTH,

06:14.041 --> 06:17.085
AND I THINK YOU'D REALLY

06:14.041 --> 06:17.085
GET INTO IT.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.085
OH, WELL.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.920
I'D LOVE TO GET INTO

06:17.127 --> 06:18.920
IT ZACK, BUT SEE,

06:18.962 --> 06:24.509
I HAVE THIS MEDICAL CONDITION

06:18.962 --> 06:24.509
WHERE I CAN'T LISTEN TO MUSIC.

06:18.962 --> 06:24.509
YOU CAN'T?

06:24.551 --> 06:30.182
NO. MY EARS -- THE HOLLOW TUBEY

06:24.551 --> 06:30.182
THING INSIDE IS VERY TINY,

06:30.224 --> 06:32.059
AND IT WILL

06:30.224 --> 06:32.059
LITERALLY EXPLODE

06:32.100 --> 06:34.353
IF I LISTEN TO ANYTHING

06:32.100 --> 06:34.353
LOUD AND MUSICAL.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.355
THAT SUCKS.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.355
I KNOW.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.899
THANKS FOR THE INVITE.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.899
I'M SURE IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.902
SO, UH, YOU GUYS HAVE

06:38.940 --> 06:41.902
A GOOD REHEARSAL.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.988
I'M GONNA GO ON INSIDE AND WRITE

06:41.943 --> 06:44.988
TO TIPPER -- GREAT GAL.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.531
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.531
BYE, PAM.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.242
SHE IS SOME KIND OF FINE.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.285
Brian: ZACK, SOME HELP

06:48.283 --> 06:50.285
WOULD BE GREAT.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.285
RELAX.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.829
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS

06:50.327 --> 06:52.829
ARE LETTING US REHEARSE HERE.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.998
YOU CAN THANK US

06:52.871 --> 06:54.998
IN THE LINER NOTES.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.792
RIGHT UNDER OUR LORD

06:55.040 --> 06:57.792
AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.792
GOOD BILLING.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.128
ARE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY PLAYING

06:57.834 --> 07:00.128
A GIG NEXT MONTH?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.006
ABBY BERLAND'S BIRTHDAY.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.006
HER PARENTS ARE LETTING HER

07:00.170 --> 07:03.006
HAVE A BAND.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.842
THAT'D BE GREAT.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.842
CROSS YOUR FINGERS SHE

07:03.048 --> 07:05.842
DOESN'T WRECK THE CAR

07:05.884 --> 07:08.427
AND HER MOTHER DOESN'T CANCEL.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.427
I'LL HIDE THE KEYS MYSELF.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.721
Brian: OKAY, I'M DONE!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.724
Dave: ME TOO.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.724
Zack: LET'S DO THIS.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.685
LISTEN, LANE, WE NEED

07:12.766 --> 07:15.685
TO TALK A SEC.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.685
SURE.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.105
NOW THAT WE FINALLY HAVE

07:15.727 --> 07:18.105
A REAL REHEARSAL SPACE,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.148
WE CAN GET SERIOUS

07:18.146 --> 07:20.148
ABOUT THE SOUND.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.148
ABSOLUTELY.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.110
I'LL NEED YOU TO REALLY

07:20.190 --> 07:23.110
STEP IT UP A LITTLE.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.110
OH.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.903
YOU'VE GOT THE POTENTIAL, BUT

07:23.151 --> 07:24.903
YOU'RE SLOPPY.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.240
I NEED A CLEAN ROLL ON THE TOMS,

07:24.945 --> 07:28.240
BUT POWERFUL LIKE MOON.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.240
OKAY.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.576
I KNOW YOU'RE A GIRL,

07:28.282 --> 07:31.576
BUT YOU NEED TO PLAY LIKE A GUY.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.870
AND IF THAT'S TOO HARD --

07:31.618 --> 07:33.870
THAT'S NOT TOO HARD.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.039
I'LL BE BETTER. I PROMISE.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.039
OKAY.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.585
OKAY, PLEASE TAKE THIS

07:37.916 --> 07:40.585
THE WAY IT'S INTENDED,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.130
BUT I'M GOING TO KICK DAVE

07:40.627 --> 07:43.130
IN THE SHINS REPEATEDLY

07:43.171 --> 07:45.173
FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.173
WHY?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.968
WHY? DID YOU HEAR THE WAY

07:45.215 --> 07:47.968
HE WAS TALKING TO YOU?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.388
"PLAY LIKE A GUY, LANE."

07:48.009 --> 07:51.388
WELL, CRY LIKE A GIRL, DAVE.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.473
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU

07:51.430 --> 07:53.473
SMILING LIKE THAT?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.350
HE FOOLED YOU.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.350
WHAT?

07:55.392 --> 07:57.894
WE THOUGHT THE OTHERS

07:55.392 --> 07:57.894
MIGHT BE CATCHING ON ABOUT US,

07:57.936 --> 08:00.981
SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.981
THAT HE BECOME A JERK?

08:01.022 --> 08:04.359
YES. IF THE OTHER GUYS SEE HIM

08:01.022 --> 08:04.359
TALKING DOWN TO ME LIKE THAT,

08:04.401 --> 08:05.652
THEY'LL BE THROWN OFF TRACK.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.988
OKAY, BUT DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU?

08:08.029 --> 08:11.158
NO WAY. BELIEVE ME, HE KNOWS I

08:08.029 --> 08:11.158
PLAY BETTER, HARDER, MOONIER,

08:11.199 --> 08:13.952
THAN ANY GUY THEY COULD POSSIBLY

08:11.199 --> 08:13.952
FIND, PLUS I SMELL BETTER.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU'RE

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
FINE WITH IT.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
I AM.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
AND ALSO, LANE, I NEED FOUR

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
STRONG DOWNBEATS,

08:18.915 --> 08:20.917
NOT TWO STRONG ONES

08:18.915 --> 08:20.917
AND TWO WHATEVER ONES.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.878
YOU SET THE TONE, LANE.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.878
IF YOU SUCK, WE SUCK.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.466
GOD, HE'S WONDERFUL.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.053
OKAY, NOW, THIS

08:30.010 --> 08:32.053
IS THE SUMATRA BLEND.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.015
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE

08:32.095 --> 08:35.015
SHARPER THAN THE COLOMBIAN.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.351
YOU KNOW,

08:35.056 --> 08:37.351
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH

08:37.392 --> 08:39.144
WHAT I THOUGHT HEAVEN

08:37.392 --> 08:39.144
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.438
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

08:39.186 --> 08:41.438
A UNICORN IN THE CORNER,

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
BUT BASICALLY,

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
YEAH, THIS IS IT.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.399
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

08:44.441 --> 08:45.900
UM, SO,

08:45.942 --> 08:48.903
I'VE HAD 15 OF THESE

08:45.942 --> 08:48.903
TINY COFFEES.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.903
YES, YOU HAVE.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.240
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT ALL

08:48.945 --> 08:52.240
OF THIS TASTING IS FREE?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.240
YES.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.534
SO I'M A CHEAP DATE.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.534
THE TASTING IS FREE,

08:54.575 --> 08:57.620
BUT I'VE TO PROMISE

08:54.575 --> 08:57.620
TO STOCK MY COFFEE CHAIN

08:54.575 --> 08:57.620
FROM THIS WAREHOUSE,

08:57.662 --> 08:59.914
SO ACTUALLY IT'S COSTING

08:57.662 --> 08:59.914
ME $11,000 A MONTH.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.501
JEEZ, I HOPE I'M WORTH IT.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.501
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.794
SO YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT

09:02.542 --> 09:04.794
HILLARY AND JEFF.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.587
RIGHT. WELL, THEY LIVE

09:04.836 --> 09:06.587
WITH THEIR MOM,

09:06.629 --> 09:08.548
BUT I GET THEM QUITE A BIT.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.634
THEY'VE BOTH RECENTLY STARTED

09:08.589 --> 09:11.634
SOCCER BECAUSE APPARENTLY

09:08.589 --> 09:11.634
IT'S THE LAW.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.971
RORY'S STILL GOT AN OUTSTANDING

09:11.676 --> 09:14.971
WARRANT ON THAT.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.971
SO HOW OLD ARE THEY?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.098
SIX AND NINE.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.098
GOOD AGES.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.518
HAVEN'T REALLY HIT

09:17.140 --> 09:19.518
A BAD ONE YET.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.518
ME EITHER.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.354
ALTHOUGH WITH RORY,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.354
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE 43.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.354
REALLY?

09:22.396 --> 09:26.149
NOT SURE WHY.

09:22.396 --> 09:26.149
JUST HAVE THE FEELING THAT'S THE

09:22.396 --> 09:26.149
YEAR SHE'S GETTING THE MOHAWK.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.318
MMM. WE LIKE SHARPER.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.655
WHEN YOU GUYS OPEN YOUR COFFEE

09:28.360 --> 09:32.655
PLACE, THIS MUST BE ON THE MENU.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.655
YEAH?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.074
MMM, THAT'S SHARPER.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.577
SO LET'S SEE.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.577
WE'VE COVERED WORK, KIDS.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.787
SHALL WE MOVE ON TO HOBBIES?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.331
NOT A HOBBY GUY.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.331
HALLELUJAH.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.624
MOST OF THE TIME I'M WORKING,

09:41.373 --> 09:43.624
WITH THE KIDS,

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
OR I'M CHARMING THE CHICKS

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
WITH COFFEE.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.171
A FEW TIMES A YEAR

09:45.668 --> 09:48.171
I'LL GO CAMPING OR FISHING.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.714
I ACTUALLY REALLY LOVE

09:48.213 --> 09:49.714
THAT STUFF.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.841
OH, YEAH?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.841
ABSOLUTELY.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.841
HOW ABOUT YOU?

09:51.883 --> 09:54.635
OH, THERE'S A REASON THEY CALL

09:51.883 --> 09:54.635
IT THE GREAT OUTDOORS, RIGHT?

09:54.677 --> 09:57.264
I WAS THINKING OF DOING

09:54.677 --> 09:57.264
A LITTLE FISHING THIS SATURDAY.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.640
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.640
THERE'S THIS GREAT PLACE --

09:59.682 --> 10:02.310
BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT FISHING.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.310
YOU WANNA COME?

09:59.682 --> 10:02.310
HUH?

10:02.352 --> 10:05.522
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.522
OH, YEAH, SURE.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.358
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.358
GREAT, IT'S A DATE.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.528
YES, IT IS A DATE.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.528
IT IS A FISHING DATE.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.488
YOU READY TO TRY ANOTHER?

10:13.530 --> 10:16.032
THERE'S ONE FROM PERU THAT COMES

10:13.530 --> 10:16.032
WITH A SURGEON'S WARNING.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.577
HEY, IF THAT LAST ONE DIDN'T

10:16.074 --> 10:18.577
KILL ME, NOTHING WILL.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
BE RIGHT BACK.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.420
RORY! RORY!

10:28.462 --> 10:29.879
THE NUMBERS ARE ALL ADDING UP.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.507
THE PLANETS ARE ALIGNING,

10:29.921 --> 10:32.507
AND I'M GOING TO MY SENIOR PROM.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.758
WHAT?

10:32.549 --> 10:33.758
YES!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.676
HOW?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.676
BECAUSE I'M BRILLIANT.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.013
MY MOM WAS IN A GOOD MOOD

10:35.718 --> 10:39.013
BECAUSE SHE MADE A BIG SALE.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.558
A DINING TABLE AND EIGHT

10:39.055 --> 10:41.558
CHAIRS, NONE OF WHICH MATCH,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.602
THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND

10:41.600 --> 10:43.602
SINCE I WAS FOUR.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.395
I'M GONNA MISS THOSE.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.395
GET OVER IT.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.815
I TOLD HER I REALLY

10:45.437 --> 10:48.815
WANTED TO GO TO THE PROM,

10:48.856 --> 10:51.109
AND I KNOW SHE DOESN'T

10:48.856 --> 10:51.109
APPROVE OF SUCH THINGS,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.903
BUT IF SHE LETS ME GO,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.903
WE'LL DO IT HER WAY.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.073
HER WAY WOULD BE

10:53.945 --> 10:57.073
NOT TO LET YOU GO.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.073
SHE SAID THAT ALSO.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.034
BUT I WENT ON TO CLARIFY

10:57.115 --> 11:00.034
THAT IF SHE LETS ME GO,

11:00.076 --> 11:01.578
SHE'LL GET FULL

11:00.076 --> 11:01.578
DRESS APPROVAL,

11:01.620 --> 11:02.870
FULL CHAPERONE APPROVAL,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
I PROMISED NOT TO

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
ACTUALLY DANCE AT THE PROM,

11:04.705 --> 11:07.459
AND WHATEVER BOY I GO WITH

11:04.705 --> 11:07.459
WILL BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND

11:07.501 --> 11:10.545
FOUR FAMILY DINNERS

11:07.501 --> 11:10.545
BEFORE SHE SIGNS OFF ON HIM

11:07.501 --> 11:10.545
BEING MY ESCORT.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.089
NICE MOVE ON USING THE WORD

11:10.587 --> 11:13.089
ESCORT INSTEAD OF DATE.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.592
THE SUBLIMINAL IS HALF

11:13.131 --> 11:15.592
THE BATTLE, RORY.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.592
GO ON.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.885
SO SHE SAT THERE,

11:15.634 --> 11:17.885
TOOK IT ALL IN,

11:17.927 --> 11:19.638
AND AFTER A

11:17.927 --> 11:19.638
REALLY LONG PAUSE,

11:19.678 --> 11:22.807
SHE LOOKS AT ME

11:19.678 --> 11:22.807
AND SAYS, "MAYBE."

11:22.849 --> 11:25.018
YOU GOT A "MAYBE"

11:22.849 --> 11:25.018
FROM MRS. KIM.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.895
I GOT A "MAYBE"

11:25.059 --> 11:27.895
FROM MRS. KIM!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.192
OKAY, LET'S START

11:30.190 --> 11:32.192
WITH BASE.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.111
RIGHT. NOW, WE'RE TALKING DAVE

11:32.233 --> 11:35.111
TAKING YOU TO THE PROM, RIGHT?

11:35.153 --> 11:36.863
OF COURSE.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.863
MY MOM LOVES HIM.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.407
LAST WEEK SHE LET HIM

11:36.904 --> 11:39.407
SIT IN OUR PEW.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.407
NO.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.201
SHE MADE ME MOVE.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.201
YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.287
I'D BE OFFENDED IF I WEREN'T SO

11:41.242 --> 11:44.287
BUSY DOING A HAPPY DANCE.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
IT'S ALL WORKING OUT

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
SO PERFECTLY.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.000
BY THE TIME SHE SAYS YES,

11:46.247 --> 11:49.000
SHE'LL LOVE HIM EVEN MORE,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
AND WHEN I SAY

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
I'M GOING WITH HIM,

11:51.085 --> 11:53.588
IT'LL BE LIKE SHE

11:51.085 --> 11:53.588
PICKED HIM OUT HERSELF.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.588
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
HEY, KIRK,

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
IS THIS WATERPROOF?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.884
WATER-RESISTANT.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.884
THANKS.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.844
SHE ASKED DAVE TO PLAY

11:57.925 --> 11:59.844
THE WEDDING.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.181
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY

11:59.886 --> 12:03.181
NON-KOREAN ALLOWED AT

11:59.886 --> 12:03.181
THE KIM FAMILY WEDDINGS.

YOU'VE BEEN TO

12:03.223 --> 12:05.225
SO MANY OF THESE WEDDINGS,

12:05.266 --> 12:08.019
YOU'RE AN HONORARY MEMBER

12:05.266 --> 12:08.019

12:05.266 --> 12:08.019
I APPRECIATE THAT.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.938
SO, YOUR COUSIN GETTING MARRIED

12:08.061 --> 12:10.938

12:17.362 --> 12:19.614
I HOPE THEY CUT AIR HOLES

12:17.362 --> 12:19.614
IN THE BOX.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.908
SHE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH,

12:19.656 --> 12:21.908
AND SHE'S NEVER MET HIM.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.618
THEN SHE'S GONNA

13:11.999 --> 13:15.794
AND WALK ON THE MOON

13:11.999 --> 13:15.794
WITHOUT A SPACE SUIT.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.796
YOU WERE TRYING

13:15.836 --> 13:17.796
TO IMPRESS HIM.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.796
OH.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.883
WHAT OH? YOU LIKE HIM.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.883
I LIKE HIM,

13:17.838 --> 13:20.883
BUT I'M NOT 16.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.428
I DON'T LIE TO GUYS

13:20.925 --> 13:23.428
TO MAKE THEM LIKE ME.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
I GOT STUCK WHEN HE

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
SAID FISHING.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.557
I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE

13:25.305 --> 13:27.557
AND NOT SAY,

13:27.599 --> 13:29.643
"FISHING? GREAT --

13:27.599 --> 13:29.643

13:29.684 --> 13:32.186
THOSE WITCHES FROM 'MACBETH.'"

13:32.228 --> 13:35.189
HONEY, WE ALL DO IT.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.189
WHEN JACKSON AND I

13:32.228 --> 13:35.189
STARTED DATING,

13:35.231 --> 13:39.026
WE WENT TO THIS PICKLING

13:35.231 --> 13:39.026
FESTIVAL, HE WORE A SHIRT

13:35.231 --> 13:39.026
WITH A FROG ON IT.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.654
SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE

13:39.068 --> 13:40.654
CONVERSATION.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.323
I SAY, "HEY, CUTE FROG."

13:40.695 --> 13:43.323
HE SAYS, "YOU LIKE FROGS?"

13:43.364 --> 13:44.907
AND I SAY, "I LOVE FROGS."

13:44.949 --> 13:46.867

13:44.949 --> 13:46.867
ANNIVERSARY,

13:46.909 --> 13:48.662

13:46.909 --> 13:48.662

13:48.703 --> 13:51.205
AND WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME, HE

13:48.703 --> 13:51.205
GAVE ME ANOTHER FROG FIGURINE.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.542
HE TOLD HIS FAMILY WHAT TO GET

13:51.247 --> 13:54.542

13:54.584 --> 13:56.377

13:54.584 --> 13:56.377
I'M THE FROG GIRL.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.421
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM

13:56.419 --> 13:58.421
YOU DON'T LOVE FROGS?

13:58.463 --> 14:00.965
NO. HE HAS THE BEST TIME

13:58.463 --> 14:00.965
BUYING THEM FOR ME,

14:01.007 --> 14:03.593
SO I JUST LET HIM BUY THEM.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.593

14:12.686 --> 14:15.480
HE'S CRAZY ABOUT. HE'S NICE.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.982
HE DRINKS A LOT OF COFFEE.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.982
IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.567
SO?

14:19.609 --> 14:23.279
SO...I'M GOING FISHING.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.279

14:28.284 --> 14:32.831
IT'S TIME TO BREAK UP,

14:28.284 --> 14:32.831
BUT HE SEEMS SO HAPPY.

14:28.284 --> 14:32.831
YOU COULD DATE HIS BROTHER.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.375
BUT THAT'S SO BEEN

14:32.872 --> 14:35.375
THERE, DONE THAT.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.375
WE COULD SWITCH.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.460
OH, YEAH.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.754

14:39.796 --> 14:42.465
RORY, WHERE IS PARIS?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.465
SHE'S ALMOST 15 MINUTES LATE.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.385
ALRIGHT. WELL, PERHAPS

14:42.507 --> 14:45.385
WE SHOULD START WITHOUT HER.

YOU CAN CONVENE THE MEETING.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.887
OKAY.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.224

14:47.928 --> 14:51.224
THEIR SEATS, WE CAN CALL

14:47.928 --> 14:51.224

14:51.265 --> 14:53.518
PARIS IS HERE!

14:53.560 --> 14:55.687

MY GAVEL, PLEASE.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.776
I CALL THIS MEETING

15:00.233 --> 15:01.776
TO ORDER.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.570
I ALREADY DID THAT.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.570
SORRY I'M LATE,

15:03.611 --> 15:05.864
BUT I HAD SOME IMPORTANT

15:03.611 --> 15:05.864
BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO --

15:05.905 --> 15:08.658
BUSINESS WHICH I MUST NOW

15:05.905 --> 15:08.658
UNFORTUNATELY SHARE

15:05.905 --> 15:08.658
WITH ALL OF YOU.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.495
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR,

15:08.700 --> 15:12.495
WHEN WE WERE SWORN IN AS

15:08.700 --> 15:12.495
YOUR GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES,

15:12.537 --> 15:15.289
WE PLACED OUR HAND ON BIBLE,

15:12.537 --> 15:15.289
AND WE TOOK AN OATH --

15:15.331 --> 15:17.083
AN OATH THAT STATED

15:15.331 --> 15:17.083
THAT OUR BEHAVIOR

15:17.124 --> 15:18.626
WOULD BE ETHICALLY

15:17.124 --> 15:18.626
AND MORALLY UPSTANDING

15:18.668 --> 15:21.170
FOR AS LONG AS WE WERE

15:18.668 --> 15:21.170
SERVING IN OFFICE.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.214
AND THAT IS WHY

15:21.212 --> 15:23.214
IT SADDENS ME GREATLY

15:23.256 --> 15:26.300
TO INFORM YOU THAT ONE OF OUR

15:23.256 --> 15:26.300
OWN HAS FORSAKEN THAT OATH.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.637
I HATE ANYTHING

15:26.342 --> 15:29.637
THAT STARTS WITH A SPEECH.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.637
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:29.679 --> 15:32.515
I HOLD IN MY HAND EVIDENCE

15:39.397 --> 15:41.148

16:05.924 --> 16:08.968
THE INNERMOST WORKINGS

16:05.924 --> 16:08.968
OF MY PERSONAL LIFE.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.511
NOT UNTIL YOU MADE HER PRIVY.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.430
EVERYONE IN SCHOOL SAW YOU

16:10.553 --> 16:12.430
WITH JAMIE.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.056
I'M STILL TALKING!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.056
SHE ALREADY KNEW!

16:14.098 --> 16:15.975
ENOUGH!

16:14.098 --> 16:15.975
WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

16:16.016 --> 16:19.312
I MOVE TO PUT TO A VOTE

16:16.016 --> 16:19.312
THE IMPEACHMENT OF RORY GILMORE.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.312
HEY!

16:19.353 --> 16:21.856
MISS GELLER, I'M SORRY,

16:19.353 --> 16:21.856
BUT WE DO NOT IMPEACH HERE.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.775
WHY NOT?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.775
THIS IS A STUDENT GOVERNMENT.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.568
I'D LIKE TO PUT TO A VOTE

16:25.610 --> 16:27.779
A RESOLUTION TO INSTATE

16:25.610 --> 16:27.779
THE ABILITY TO IMPEACH.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.071
NO.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.071
THEN SHE SHOULD RESIGN.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.782
I'M NOT GOING TO RESIGN.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.701
YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM,

16:30.824 --> 16:33.701
YOU RESIGN.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.701
NO, YOU RESIGN!

16:33.743 --> 16:35.453
NO ONE IS RESIGNING.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.997
I'LL STAY WITH HIM TILL FRIDAY,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.997
SEE HOW IT GOES.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.332
THAT SOUNDS FAIR.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.208
YOU CAN TAKE THIS ARGUMENT

16:39.373 --> 16:41.208
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
THIS IS STUDENT COUNCIL.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.630
REAL SCHOOL MATTERS ARE THE

16:43.127 --> 16:45.630
ONLY THINGS THAT MATTER HERE.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.633
NOW, PARIS, MOVE ON.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.885
THE SWIMMING POOL

16:48.675 --> 16:50.885
NEEDS REPLASTERING.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.929
IDEAS FOR FUND-RAISING, PLEASE.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.228
EXCUSE ME?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.940
HI, I'M LOOKING FOR

17:01.270 --> 17:03.940
A MR. LUCAS DANES?

17:03.982 --> 17:05.107
OH, LUCAS?

17:03.982 --> 17:05.107
WHAT?

17:05.149 --> 17:06.442
IRS.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.945
I'M NOT IRS.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.070
I'M LUKE DANES.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.781
<i>LUKE</i> DANES. SORRY.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.533
HELLO, LUKE DANES.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.533
I'M NICOLE LEAHY.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
I'M TAYLOR DOOSE'S ATTORNEY.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
OH, JEEZ.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.538
HE WANTED ME TO BRING --

17:16.118 --> 17:18.538
YEAH, THE LEASE AGREEMENTS.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.581
I TOLD HIM TO WALK THEM

17:18.579 --> 17:20.581
OVER HERE,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.667
BUT WHAT'S THE FUN

17:20.623 --> 17:22.667
OF BEING TAYLOR, RIGHT?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.711
I'M SORRY IF THIS

17:22.709 --> 17:24.711
IS A BAD TIME.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.754
IT WON'T TAKE ME VERY LONG.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.754
FINE. WHATEVER.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.589
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.799
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

17:29.841 --> 17:32.426
YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.971
I REALLY JUST NEED TO WITNESS

17:32.468 --> 17:34.971
YOUR SIGNATURE, IS ALL.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.514
IT'S ACTUALLY

17:35.013 --> 17:36.514
JUST A FORMALITY.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.517
IN OTHER WORDS, COMPLETELY

17:36.556 --> 17:39.517
RIDICULOUS AND UNNECESSARY.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.310
UH-HUH.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.310
OKAY.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.897
MR. DOOSE REALLY LIKES THINGS

17:41.352 --> 17:43.897
TO BE FORMAL...

17:43.938 --> 17:45.815
AND NEAT...

17:43.938 --> 17:45.815
AND IN TRIPLICATE.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.942
HE JUST LOVES THINGS

17:45.857 --> 17:47.942
IN TRIPLICATE.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
MMM. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
CUP OF COFFEE.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.407
THANKS.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.407
SO TELL ME SOMETHING.

17:54.448 --> 17:58.202
WHAT'S IT LIKE

17:54.448 --> 17:58.202
BEING TAYLOR'S LAWYER?

17:58.244 --> 18:01.247
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT EXACTLY

17:58.244 --> 18:01.247
MR. DOOSE'S LAWYER.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.247
OR ONLY LAWYER.

18:01.288 --> 18:05.084
HE'S ONE OF OUR SELECT CLIENTS,

18:01.288 --> 18:05.084
SO WE DEAL WITH HIM

18:01.288 --> 18:05.084
ON A ROTATING BASIS.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.377
IT'S MY MONTH.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.377
MY CONDOLENCES.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.004
MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME,

18:08.046 --> 18:10.297
"THAT WHICH DOES NOT KILL YOU

18:08.046 --> 18:10.297
MAKES YOU STRONGER."

18:10.339 --> 18:12.717
YOU'RE GONNA BE REALLY STRONG.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.717
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.597
IF YOU RUN INTO SOMEONE PINNED

18:12.759 --> 18:17.597
UNDERNEATH A TRUCK, PICK IT UP.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.597
IT'S GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.391
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE

18:17.638 --> 18:20.391
THAT'S THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.477
GREAT. YOU AND MR. DOOSE ARE

18:20.433 --> 18:23.477
OFFICIALLY IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.146
I'M SO SORRY.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.146
I MEANT THAT AS A GOOD THING.

18:26.188 --> 18:30.276
IT'S OKAY.

18:26.188 --> 18:30.276
I WILL LET YOU

18:26.188 --> 18:30.276
GET BACK TO WORK. LET ME...

18:30.317 --> 18:32.111
OH, NO. ON ME.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.404
TELL YOU WHAT --

18:32.152 --> 18:33.404
IT'S BUSINESS,

18:33.446 --> 18:35.197
LET'S LET MR. DOOSE

18:33.446 --> 18:35.197
PAY FOR IT.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.658
EVEN BETTER.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.748
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING SHOW.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.748
WHAT ARE YOU YAMMERING ABOUT?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
GUESS GLORIA ALLRED

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
WANTS TO GO SLUMMING.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
SHUT UP.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.335
SHE WAS TOTALLY

18:46.084 --> 18:48.335
COMING ONTO YOU.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.335
SHE WAS NOT.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.671
COULDN'T YOU HEAR HER PANTING

18:48.377 --> 18:50.671
WHEN YOU WERE SIGNING?

18:50.713 --> 18:52.548
DIDN'T SEE IT.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.548
SHE LAUGHED AT YOUR JOKES.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.550
THERE'S GOTTA BE

18:52.590 --> 18:54.550
SOME ULTERIOR MOTIVE

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
TO PEOPLE THAT

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
LAUGH AT YOUR JOKES.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.845
OKAY. WHATEVER.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.845
EVEN IF THERE WAS SOMETHING,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.932
WHICH I'M NOT SAYING THERE WAS,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.932
SHE'S A SUIT. NOT MY TYPE.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.434
YEAH, ESPECIALLY SINCE

19:00.974 --> 19:03.434
SHE'S NOT A MONK.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.311
OH, I DON'T GO OUT THAT MUCH?

19:05.352 --> 19:08.106
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

19:05.352 --> 19:08.106
YOU WENT ON A DATE?

19:08.188 --> 19:10.399
LAST MONTH, WISEASS.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.399
I WENT OUT WITH JOANNA COOPER.

19:10.441 --> 19:14.236
YOU GAVE HER A RIDE HOME.

19:10.441 --> 19:14.236
A RIDE HOME

19:10.441 --> 19:14.236
IS THE END OF A DATE.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.824
ONLY IF YOU GO ON A DATE FIRST.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.824
I'M NOT DISCUSSING THIS

19:14.278 --> 19:17.824
WITH YOU.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.661
I'VE TO GO MEET RORY.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.661
I'M GONNA GO PICK HER UP,

19:17.865 --> 19:21.661
ACTUALLY BE WITH HER,

19:21.702 --> 19:24.747
THEN GIVE HER A RIDE HOME.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.747
THAT'S THE END OF A DATE.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.834
OR I COULD STAY OPEN WHICH MEANS

19:24.789 --> 19:27.834
YOU'RE HERE TILL 10:00.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.877
THAT'S ALSO CALLED

19:27.875 --> 19:29.877
THE END OF A DATE.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.378
HOPELESS.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.378
BYE, NOW.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.726
HEY.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.726
GOT ANY GOOD STORIES?

19:45.768 --> 19:48.146
NO, SORRY.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.146
AW, NOTHING?

19:48.187 --> 19:51.065
NO CRAZY, COLORFUL UNCLE,

19:48.187 --> 19:51.065
BEST FRIEND WITH A FUNNY NAME?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.275
JEFF SMITH.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.654
SKELETONS IN THE FAMILY CLOSET,

19:53.317 --> 19:56.654
WAR WOUNDS, FUNNY-SHAPED SCARS?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.406
IT REALLY THROWS YOU OFF

19:56.696 --> 19:59.406
WHEN RORY'S LATE, DOESN'T IT?

19:59.448 --> 20:00.741
BIG TIME.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.119
OH!

20:00.783 --> 20:03.119
YAY! THANK GOD!

20:03.161 --> 20:04.787
SORRY.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.787
DIDN'T LUKE KEEP YOU COMPANY?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.580
HE TRIED,

20:04.829 --> 20:06.580
BUT REALLY, HE'S GOT NOTHING.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.166
THANK YOU.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.501
WHAT'S WITH

20:08.207 --> 20:10.501
ALL THE BOOKS?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.501
WE'RE GOING TO FISH.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.961
WITH THESE?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.961
YES.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.631
SO WE THROW THEM IN

20:12.003 --> 20:15.631
AND TRY TO KNOCK THE FISH OUT?

20:15.673 --> 20:19.719
I WENT TO THE LIBRARY. GOT ALL

20:15.673 --> 20:19.719
OF THEIR BEST BOOKS ON FISHING.

20:15.673 --> 20:19.719
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.262
DO YOU WANNA LEARN TO FISH

20:19.760 --> 20:22.262
OR NOT? EXCITING, HUH?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.058
I CAN BARELY KEEP STILL.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.058
"CHAPTER ONE -- TECHNIQUE.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.810
FOR DEEPWATER FISHING,

20:25.099 --> 20:27.810

20:27.852 --> 20:30.104
THAT WOULD BE YOU.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.104
OH, BETTER REMEMBER THAT. OKAY.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.565
"FOR DEEPWATER FISHING,

20:30.146 --> 20:32.565
AN ANGLER" -- ME AGAIN --

20:37.737 --> 20:39.822
IS THE APPROPRIATE LURE."

20:39.864 --> 20:42.909
OOH, WHAT ABOUT THE SEQUINED TOP

20:39.864 --> 20:42.909
I WORE TO THE CHRISTMAS PARTY?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.203
YES, I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY

20:42.950 --> 20:45.203
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

20:53.127 --> 20:57.173
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW

20:53.127 --> 20:57.173
THE LARGER, FLASHY BAITS ARE

20:53.127 --> 20:57.173
JUST GONNA MAKE ME LOOK CHEAP.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.299
LET'S REVIEW.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.299
WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR?

20:59.341 --> 21:02.386
I NEED FLASHY BAITS

20:59.341 --> 21:02.386
IF I'M GOING TO INVEST IN CISCO,

21:02.428 --> 21:05.806

21:02.428 --> 21:05.806
IN MY DOWNRIGGER.

21:05.848 --> 21:06.807
HEY, THAT'S GOOD.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.308
DOING A LITTLE STUDYING?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.894
MY MOM'S LEARNING

21:08.350 --> 21:09.894
HOW TO FISH.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.687
YOU'RE<i> WHAT?</i>

21:09.936 --> 21:11.687
<i>I'M LEARNING HOW TO FISH.</i>

21:11.729 --> 21:14.398
SORRY, WRONG INFLECTION.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.398
<i>YOU'RE</i> WHAT?

21:11.729 --> 21:14.398
GO AWAY.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.316
WHY ARE YOU LEARNING

21:14.440 --> 21:16.316
HOW TO FISH?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.527
IT'S JUST SOMETHING

21:16.358 --> 21:18.527
I WANTED TO DO.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.405
SOME FRIENDS OF MINE FISH.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.405
OKAY.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.950
AND WHAT IF I'M A

21:21.447 --> 21:23.950
REALLY GREAT FISHER? I MEAN

21:23.991 --> 21:27.036
WHAT IF THAT'S MY CALLING,

21:23.991 --> 21:27.036
THE THING THAT I'M MEANT TO DO?

21:27.078 --> 21:31.165
ALL THIS TIME, I'VE BEEN SITTING

21:27.078 --> 21:31.165
HERE WITH THE GIFT OF FISH,

21:27.078 --> 21:31.165
AND I'M SQUANDERING IT.

21:31.207 --> 21:35.002
IT'S LIKE IF MOZART

21:31.207 --> 21:35.002
WALKED RIGHT BY THE PIANO STORE

21:31.207 --> 21:35.002
AND NEVER PLAYED A NOTE.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.546
SO YOU'RE GONNA FISH

21:35.044 --> 21:37.546
TO FULFILL YOUR DESTINY.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.546
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.091
AND YOU'RE GONNA LEARN TO FISH

21:37.588 --> 21:40.091
TO FULFILL YOUR DESTINY

21:40.133 --> 21:41.175
FROM A BOOK?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.175
YES.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.885
AND YOU SANCTIONED THIS?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.885
YES.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.763
THELMA, LOUISE, POSSIBLY THERE'S

21:42.927 --> 21:45.763
ANOTHER WAY TO LEARN TO FISH.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.514
THE FISHING CHANNEL.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.514
I FISH.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.935
OH, WE'VE SEEN THOSE BOOTS

21:47.556 --> 21:50.935
THINGIES OUTSIDE DRYING OFF.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.564
THE GUITAR PLAYER?

40:41.606 --> 40:44.442
I KNOW. CRAZY, RIGHT?

40:41.606 --> 40:44.442
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

40:44.483 --> 40:47.612
BECAUSE TO BE QUITE HONEST

40:44.483 --> 40:47.612
WITH YOU, WHEN I FIRST MET HIM,

40:47.653 --> 40:49.906
WHEN YOU HIRED HIM TO PLAY

40:47.653 --> 40:49.906
AT THANKSGIVING,

40:49.948 --> 40:52.700
I JUST DIDN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.700
HE BUGGED ME, ACTUALLY.

40:52.742 --> 40:55.036
BUT THE MORE YOU LIKED HIM

40:52.742 --> 40:55.036
AND TRUSTED HIM,

40:55.078 --> 40:59.207
THE MORE I SAW THE GOOD IN

40:55.078 --> 40:59.207
HIM -- THE GOD IN HIM, ACTUALLY.

40:59.249 --> 41:02.085
AND NOW I'M CONVINCED...

41:02.127 --> 41:04.837
HE'S THE BOY

41:02.127 --> 41:04.837
I WANT TO TAKE ME TO PROM.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.881
HE'S NOT KOREAN.

41:12.595 --> 41:17.475
LANE. HEY, LANE?

41:12.595 --> 41:17.475
IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?

41:17.516 --> 41:19.436
YOU'RE NOT KOREAN.

41:33.616 --> 41:34.742
I'M HOME!

41:34.784 --> 41:36.744
Lorelai: UPSTAIRS.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.744
BATHROOM.

41:44.461 --> 41:45.962
HEY.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.922
OH, NO.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.922
ISN'T SHE CUTE?

41:47.964 --> 41:51.259
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:47.964 --> 41:51.259
THE CORK FELL OFF MY HOOK

41:47.964 --> 41:51.259
AND JAYNE MANSFIELD HERE BIT.

41:51.301 --> 41:54.304
JAYNE MANSFIELD?

41:51.301 --> 41:54.304
NOT THE BRIGHTEST FISH,

41:51.301 --> 41:54.304
BUT SHE'S AWFULLY PRETTY.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.596
YOU CAUGHT A FISH.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.596
YES.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.140
AND YOU BROUGHT IT HOME.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.140
YES.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.434
HOW WILL YOU TAKE A BATH?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.434
I DON'T KNOW.

41:59.476 --> 42:01.727
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA LIVE?

41:59.476 --> 42:01.727
HARD TO SAY.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.814
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA FEED IT?

42:01.769 --> 42:04.814
THIS IS WHY I DON'T FISH.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.608
SHE IS KIND OF CUTE.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.608
SHE HAS A GREAT TAIL SWISH.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.902
OTHER THAN BRINGING HOME

42:07.650 --> 42:09.902
A PET, HOW WAS FISHING?

42:09.944 --> 42:12.697
GOOD. THE LAKE WAS BEAUTIFUL --

42:09.944 --> 42:12.697
SNOWY AND SPARKLY --

42:12.738 --> 42:15.492
AND RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD

42:12.738 --> 42:15.492
FROM THE SHAHAELA LODGE AND SPA.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.452
I KNEW THAT.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.452
HOW?

42:17.494 --> 42:19.245
ALEX TOLD ME

42:17.494 --> 42:19.245
WHEN YOU GUYS LEFT.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.164
YOU'RE ALREADY

42:19.287 --> 42:21.164
IN CAHOOTS WITH EACH OTHER.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.291
EH, WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M WILY.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.291
UH-HUH.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.084
ARE YOU GOING OUT

42:23.333 --> 42:25.084
WITH HIM AGAIN?

42:25.126 --> 42:26.252
UH-HUH.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.252
CAMPING?

42:26.294 --> 42:27.795
UNH-UNH.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.795
GOOD.

42:27.837 --> 42:30.965
YOU THINK WE SHOULD SEND HER

42:27.837 --> 42:30.965
BACK INTO THE WILD?

42:31.007 --> 42:33.092
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK

42:31.007 --> 42:33.092
SHE'S ALREADY DOMESTICATED --

42:33.134 --> 42:35.636
BATHS AND SCENTED CANDLES.

42:33.134 --> 42:35.636
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP HER.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.097
MAYBE WE CAN TRAIN HER

42:35.678 --> 42:38.097
TO DO TRICKS.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.097
TOMORROW.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.058
GOODNIGHT, JAYNE.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.645
[ SPLASHING ]
