00:05.405 --> 00:08.203
Whatever.
Whatever.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.265
( Scoffs )
Yeah, like I care.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.904
All right. I'll talk
to you later,Jackie.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.813
Ew. Do you mind not getting
all gooey and romantic...

00:16.883 --> 00:18.851
when I'm about to eat my breakfast?

00:18.918 --> 00:21.478
What crawled up your butt?

00:21.554 --> 00:23.613
You and Jackie.

00:24.991 --> 00:27.186
Then you started
making out in there.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.287
Hey! No more butt talk at breakfast.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.389
Look, if you're not gonna
break up with Jackie...

00:33.466 --> 00:35.400
then you have to tell Kelso, okay?

00:35.468 --> 00:40.030
- It's like the ethical thing to do.
- Thank you,Johnny Cub Scout.

00:40.106 --> 00:43.371
What are you gonna do, take away
my friendship merit badge?

00:43.443 --> 00:47.504
No, because Cub Scouts
are awarded achievement beads.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.383
Badges.
( Chuckles )

00:55.388 --> 00:58.323
- So, anybody hungry?
- Yeah.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.689
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Starved!

01:00.760 --> 01:02.785
Ladies first.

01:04.964 --> 01:07.057
Or ladies only.

01:07.133 --> 01:11.194
Oh, well, um-
well, it's not all for me.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.206
I'm eating for two now.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.437
- ( Red, Hyde, Eric ) What?
- I'm pregnant.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.708
Oh, God. No!

01:23.483 --> 01:27.317
I mean, great.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.892
Kitty, are you sure
you're-you're pregnant?

02:11.965 --> 02:15.128
Maybe you're just
puttin' on your winter weight.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.533
Red, a woman knows.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.205
Not to mention I'm late.
And not for work.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.546
For my menstrual cycle.
Hooray!

02:33.086 --> 02:36.749
That is great news, Mrs. Forman.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.314
Now, you stay away
from those smokes.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.986
If you smoke when you're pregnant,
they come out all spindly.

02:42.061 --> 02:43.995
Shut up.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.122
Mom, congratulations.
This is awesome.

02:46.199 --> 02:49.362
Please, love me the most.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.631
Well, you're sure
being quiet over there, Red.

02:54.707 --> 02:58.973
I'm... soaking in the moment.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.639
Okay. I-I know this is unexpected...

03:01.714 --> 03:04.877
but I just think it's gonna bring us
so much happiness, don't you?

03:04.951 --> 03:07.886
Sure.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.252
You know how much I love babies.

03:10.323 --> 03:14.316
( Laughing )
Oh, what a day. I am so happy.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.328
I'm just-
I'm just gonna go throw up.

03:19.899 --> 03:23.426
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

03:24.938 --> 03:29.534
Hmm. Maybe it's about time
we had ''the talk.''

03:32.045 --> 03:34.809
You see, when a boy
loves a girl-

03:34.881 --> 03:37.975
- Doesn't have to love her.
- That's true.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.750
''Anyhoo,''
the boy's sexual organ-

03:43.823 --> 03:45.814
Hey!

03:45.892 --> 03:48.053
Shut it, dumb-ass.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.065
Wow. That kid's gonna love it here.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.202
I can't believe
they're having a baby.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.243
I can't believe they're still
having sex.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.879
I mean, my Dad's back goes out if you
look at him wrong.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.012
- That's why she was probably on top.
- Thanks.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.525
Thanks, Hyde.
You just killed a part of me.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.724
Yeah. That's why you got
to put on your raincoat...

04:26.799 --> 04:29.666
every damn time.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.899
Well, except for the first time.
Free pass!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.974
No, Kelso, that's just a myth.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.341
You're only safe if you do it underwater.
Right, Hyde?

04:42.415 --> 04:44.815
That's right, buddy.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.952
Oops.
Oh, a little help, Donna.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.617
- Sure.
- Oh, nice!

04:52.692 --> 04:55.286
Catch this, tool!

04:55.361 --> 04:57.795
- What was that for?
- You keep dropping the ball.

04:57.864 --> 05:02.597
Well, so I'm a butterfingers.
Isn't that punishment enough?

05:02.669 --> 05:06.605
Now look. The ball's all the way
over there in the backyard.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.607
Little help, Donna.
( Groans )

05:08.675 --> 05:12.543
God! Fine, I'll get it. God!

05:12.612 --> 05:15.979
Hey, Steven.
I had fun last night.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.109
- You had fun doing what?
- Huh? Hey, Michael.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.279
Um, I went to the movies.
Right, Donna?

05:22.355 --> 05:25.654
Oh, um, I don't know.
I was with Eric all night.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.659
But I'm really interested
in this movie.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.752
Why don't you tell us
all about it?

05:31.898 --> 05:34.332
Donna?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.595
Fine.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.605
You know, it's that new movie
starring that big, red whore.

05:40.673 --> 05:45.440
Oh, you mean, the one where the big,
red whore is sick of people keeping secrets.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.208
No. No, no. The one where the big, red whore
keeps sticking her big, red nose...

05:49.282 --> 05:51.580
in places where it
doesn't belong.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.178
Hey. Watch what you say
about the big, red whore.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.921
Thank you, Eric. What did Sissy Spacek
ever do to any of you?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.562
Way to go, guys.
You know how he feels about Sissy!

06:13.639 --> 06:15.903
Fez, wait!

06:15.975 --> 06:18.034
Donna, what is with you?

06:18.111 --> 06:22.013
Look, I'm sick of covering
for your creepy, unnatural relationship.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.174
And I shouldn't have to.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.186
I mean, Hyde, you and Kelso have been friends
forever, and you owe it to him to tell him.

06:28.254 --> 06:32.452
Yeah, this is way worse than when you stole
his headgear and used it to clean out your sink.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.125
It's tough love, man.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.288
You know what?
Forget it.

06:38.364 --> 06:41.390
You obviously don't care about Kelso
or any of the rest of us.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.868
Yeah, 'cause when this blows up,
guess what. We're all screwed.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.468
Steven, do you really think
we're a creepy, unnatural couple?

06:51.544 --> 06:54.980
Come on.
That's a crazy question.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.073
I mean, if this relationship wasn't just
a little bit creepy and unnatural...

06:58.151 --> 07:00.312
I wouldn't be in it.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.521
Oh, Eric, look.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.358
Your little, pink baby sweater.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.730
Oh, oh, and the matching
pink bonnet.

07:16.669 --> 07:20.161
Um, had they explained
to you yet that I was a boy?

07:21.340 --> 07:24.241
Oh, I am just
so excited about this baby.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.040
Well, yeah.
You should be.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.547
And Dad should be too.
What's with him anyway?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.981
Oh, no. That's just his way.
He'll be fine.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.144
When I first told him
about you...

07:34.220 --> 07:36.745
he said, ''Oh, crap!''
and stormed out.

07:36.823 --> 07:40.020
But then he came back
happy as a clam.

07:40.092 --> 07:44.654
And then, of course, when you got older,
he got mad again...

07:44.730 --> 07:48.097
on account of you
not being so very good at sports.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.136
Don't worry about your father.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.173
He'll come around.
He always does.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.378
My ''banky-boo''!

08:01.814 --> 08:03.975
Hey, Forman.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.952
So I've decided I'm gonna tell Kelso
about me and Jackie.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.512
Well, well. I'm glad you finally decided
to listen to your conscience.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.027
It's not my conscience, man,
'cause I don't have a conscience.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.221
You know that.
It's just 'cause, you know...

08:17.296 --> 08:19.992
I figured me and Jackie might be
together a little while, so-

08:20.066 --> 08:23.797
But, man, she's the devil.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.499
What can I do?
She's hot.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.700
No, you only think she's hot...

08:29.775 --> 08:32.642
because she's made of hellfire.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.775
All right. What if you were stranded
on a desert island with her?

08:37.850 --> 08:40.216
( Sighs )
Murder-suicide.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.447
Okay.

08:42.522 --> 08:47.118
PictureJackie in a little bikini
made out of coconuts.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.856
Where's our signal fire?

08:50.930 --> 08:54.024
And don't give me any,
''Oh, boo-hoo, my hands are bleeding.''

08:54.100 --> 08:56.091
Suck it up.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.331
Aw, damn, I got a splinter.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.374
You couldn't grab the tweezers
as the ship was going down?

09:02.441 --> 09:05.239
( Scoffs )
Moron.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.508
Well, that was unpleasant.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.312
Okay. Try it again.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.514
But this time do what I do.

09:16.589 --> 09:20.389
( No Audible Dialogue )

09:34.807 --> 09:37.674
Good God, she is hot.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.014
Hey, guys.
What you talkin' about?

09:42.081 --> 09:44.572
( Hyde, Eric )
Indy 500.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.641
- Nice.
- All right.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.848
Hey, can one of you guys give me a ride
to the D.M.V. tomorrow?

09:53.926 --> 09:56.087
- I lost my license in California.
- Sure, Hyde'll take you.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.892
- What?
- Yeah. It will give you two a chance to catch up.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.297
He can tell you how he spent
his summer break.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.069
Yeah.
All right.

10:06.973 --> 10:10.773
- So what happened to your license, man?
- Oh, a shark ate it.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.279
Really?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.482
How?

10:19.986 --> 10:22.477
Fine. I lost it.
You happy now!

10:24.724 --> 10:26.715
Oh, here you are.
How ya feeling?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.783
Better?
I bet you're feeling better.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.125
I'm fine.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.167
Is that liquor on your breath?

10:37.236 --> 10:39.170
What is the matter with you, Red?

10:39.238 --> 10:41.433
Well-

10:41.507 --> 10:44.408
You know-
I mean-

10:46.946 --> 10:48.880
It's just-

10:48.948 --> 10:51.314
I'm not sellin' the Corvette!

10:51.384 --> 10:54.911
- What?
- Kids are expensive.

10:54.987 --> 10:58.081
That's gonna be
the first thing to go.

10:58.157 --> 11:03.652
I waited 25 years to have
that car because we had kids.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.493
And believe me, I love them.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.901
But this is supposed to be our time.

11:12.938 --> 11:18.535
Kitty, people our age don't have kids.
They have grandkids.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.239
Well, we're having a kid,
so deal with it.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.840
Well, I'm having a Corvette,
so deal with that!

11:28.354 --> 11:31.323
Ooh, a staring contest.
I got winner.

11:39.098 --> 11:43.933
Okay, Mr. Red, it looks like
it's just you and me.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.341
Still the king.

12:00.125 --> 12:05.119
And here I am ecstatic, and Red comes home
babbling about his precious Corvette.

12:05.197 --> 12:07.358
Well, I'll tell you something.

12:07.432 --> 12:11.835
I may be the one who's pregnant,
but I did not get that way by myself.

12:11.904 --> 12:13.929
He's the one who
wouldn't go to sleep.

12:15.641 --> 12:18.405
You know, Mrs. Forman, there are other ways
of dealing with that.

12:18.477 --> 12:21.776
I mean, have you tried telling him
you just like him as a friend?

12:25.050 --> 12:28.884
You're carrying Red's baby.
He should be kissing your ass.

12:28.954 --> 12:33.084
God! Why are men such jerks? Huh?

12:33.158 --> 12:35.319
Tell me.

12:37.930 --> 12:40.228
Well, I just came in here
for the ice cream...

12:40.299 --> 12:43.166
so I'm just gonna make mine to go.

12:45.904 --> 12:48.372
Men plant their seed
and think their work is done.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.773
But women have a being
growing inside of us...

12:51.843 --> 12:54.505
the size of a wine jug.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.605
It's got to come out somehow.

12:56.682 --> 12:59.810
Oh, oh, oh. It's like that
nature show, you know...

12:59.885 --> 13:04.117
where the snake eats an antelope in one bite,
and you're thinking, ''Impossible.''

13:04.189 --> 13:08.626
And then it-it-it
unhinges its jaw, and in it goes.

13:08.694 --> 13:12.790
Well, giving birth is just like that,
only the other direction.

13:12.864 --> 13:16.027
And I need your father there,
holding my hand and telling me it's okay...

13:16.101 --> 13:20.197
because I can't swallow
an antelope alone.

13:21.540 --> 13:25.203
No, you can't.
And no woman should have to.

13:26.979 --> 13:28.970
That bastard.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.112
( Chattering )

13:38.357 --> 13:43.056
Ah, we've been here for, like, an hour.
We've only moved, like, two feet.

13:43.128 --> 13:45.528
You think the lines
at the D.M.V. are long?

13:45.597 --> 13:48.862
You should see the free clinic.

13:48.934 --> 13:51.869
Now, there's a wait.

13:51.937 --> 13:55.168
Man, you've been to the free clinic?

13:55.240 --> 13:58.038
No.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.044
Oh, but I did see your mom there.

14:00.112 --> 14:02.046
Burn!

14:02.114 --> 14:04.480
( Groans )

14:04.549 --> 14:07.040
( Chuckles )
That's gonna leave a mark.

14:07.119 --> 14:09.747
Just like your mom did!

14:14.459 --> 14:17.087
Come on.
Move it! Damn!

14:18.630 --> 14:23.090
Gentlemen, I'm sorry you
had to see my dark side.

14:23.168 --> 14:25.864
Please excuse me.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

14:25.937 --> 14:28.633
Ta-ta.

14:31.843 --> 14:34.607
( Clears Throat )

14:34.680 --> 14:37.012
Look, man, I got to talk to you
about some things...

14:37.082 --> 14:39.050
that happened while
you were gone this summer.

14:39.117 --> 14:42.416
Hyde, if this is about
free ice cream, naked volleyball...

14:42.487 --> 14:46.947
or a dog wearing a hat and sunglasses,
I'd rather not even know.

14:48.226 --> 14:51.059
No, it's aboutJackie.

14:51.129 --> 14:53.256
What aboutJackie?

14:53.332 --> 14:56.028
She was with someone,
I knew it. Damn it!

14:56.101 --> 14:58.934
Well, you know, you guys are broken up,
so who cares, right?

14:59.004 --> 15:03.441
We're not-
I don't care. It's just-

15:03.508 --> 15:07.638
I mean, she was
a big part of my life...

15:07.713 --> 15:11.171
and I just hate the thought of her
being off with some random guy.

15:11.249 --> 15:13.877
Well, what if I told you
it was with a friend?

15:13.952 --> 15:16.147
Would that make it better?

15:16.221 --> 15:18.382
No.

15:18.457 --> 15:22.757
That would make it worse, stupid.

15:22.828 --> 15:26.320
Aw, you're messing with me.

15:26.398 --> 15:29.162
Okay, 'cause I-
A friend would never do that.

15:29.234 --> 15:32.067
Aw, man.
Hyde, you got me again.

15:32.137 --> 15:34.071
Just like I got your mom!
( Laughing )

15:36.808 --> 15:39.106
What is with the hitting?

15:40.812 --> 15:42.746
Guys?

15:42.814 --> 15:45.647
I love this place.
I want to work here.

15:45.717 --> 15:47.651
You just said you hated it.

15:47.719 --> 15:50.950
Yeah, but I went up to the counter,
and the guy treated me like crap.

15:51.022 --> 15:54.753
But he was treating everybody like crap-
poor, rich, black, white.

15:54.826 --> 15:56.760
We're all crap.

15:56.828 --> 15:58.796
And look at him.

15:58.864 --> 16:00.798
<i>Think he was popular in high school?</i>

16:00.866 --> 16:05.394
No way.
But now... he's the belle of the ball.

16:07.205 --> 16:11.198
Well, my friends, it's my turn
to get a taste of those balls.

16:21.219 --> 16:25.485
Hey. I was just inside with Mom
and she's really upset.

16:25.557 --> 16:28.754
I just want to know-
What's your problem?

16:31.062 --> 16:33.997
You made me bald.

16:38.904 --> 16:41.702
- What?
- Five generations-

16:41.773 --> 16:46.472
not one bald head in my family.

16:46.545 --> 16:50.345
Then you came along, and-
Well, look at it.

16:52.884 --> 16:55.114
Children make me bald.

16:57.622 --> 17:00.250
You know what?
Wear a hat.

17:04.029 --> 17:05.963
'Cause Mom is really scared...

17:06.031 --> 17:08.396
and she could really use
a little damn support right now.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.401
And I don't usually
tell you what to do...

17:10.469 --> 17:14.666
'cause you usually do the right thing,
but this time you didn't.

17:14.739 --> 17:18.732
You know how you're always telling me
to be a man? Well, be a man!

17:18.810 --> 17:20.835
I made you bald?
You made me skinny!

17:29.654 --> 17:32.623
Oh, hey. How'd it go at the D.M.V.?
Did you tell Kelso?

17:32.691 --> 17:34.784
Nah, I blew it off.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.988
What? Why?

17:38.063 --> 17:41.464
I don't know.
It's just really hot in there.

17:45.103 --> 17:48.231
Really? 'Cause I think
you chickened out.

17:48.306 --> 17:51.036
No, I didn't chicken out, man.

17:51.109 --> 17:54.943
I just didn't want to drop the news
in front of all those people, you know?

17:55.013 --> 17:57.846
I mean, haven't I done
enough to the guy?

18:00.785 --> 18:04.050
So you felt bad?

18:04.122 --> 18:07.182
Oh, my God, you felt bad!

18:07.259 --> 18:10.456
No, I don't feel bad.
I don't feel anything.

18:10.529 --> 18:15.796
I don't know. I think someone's
been to Oz and gotten himself a heart.

18:20.772 --> 18:24.435
- Shut up, Forman.
- Yeah, Eric.

18:24.509 --> 18:27.910
Maybe we should lay off.
He's had a rough day.

18:27.979 --> 18:30.675
- Aw.
- I really want to lay off...

18:30.749 --> 18:33.445
but it's just so hot in here.

18:33.518 --> 18:36.078
Get bent!

18:36.154 --> 18:38.588
- <i>( Door Closes )</i>
- He felt bad.

18:38.657 --> 18:41.956
- I think we really got through to him.
- Yeah.

18:42.027 --> 18:45.087
- He's not gonna tell Kelso.
- No.

18:51.002 --> 18:53.664
Oh. So you're hiding out here.

18:54.973 --> 18:57.373
Got a call for some man
about a Corvette.

18:57.442 --> 19:02.345
What, you gonna buy another one so you can
ride 'em around like a couple of water skis?

19:02.414 --> 19:06.145
- I'm selling the Corvette.
- What?

19:06.217 --> 19:08.310
Look, could we finish this later?

19:08.386 --> 19:10.581
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

19:14.292 --> 19:16.226
Is that Eric's old cradle?

19:16.294 --> 19:20.822
Yeah, well, uh, the paint was
all chipped off...

19:20.899 --> 19:24.266
and I kind
of remember that, uh-

19:24.336 --> 19:27.328
that they liked
sleepin' in this thing...

19:30.942 --> 19:35.106
when they weren't peein' and poopin'
all over the place.

19:36.648 --> 19:40.414
Oh, Red.
That is so sweet.

19:42.354 --> 19:44.345
Yeah, well...

19:45.523 --> 19:47.548
it might be fun.

19:47.626 --> 19:50.789
Hell, this time
we might even get an athlete.

19:50.862 --> 19:52.853
Oh!

20:01.306 --> 20:03.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:03.308 --> 20:05.242
So did you tell Michael yet?

20:05.310 --> 20:08.837
Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna,
but, um, you know...

20:08.913 --> 20:11.381
the... timing just
didn't seem right.

20:11.449 --> 20:13.383
Oh, I-I understand.

20:13.451 --> 20:16.852
I mean, it's kind of like-
it's kind of like setting your hair.

20:16.921 --> 20:21.858
If you don't wait long enough, then it's
totally flat and- ( Scoffs ) like Donna's.

20:21.926 --> 20:26.522
But if you wait just the right amount of time,
then it's perfect...

20:26.598 --> 20:28.691
like mine.

20:30.669 --> 20:32.603
Steven, are you even
listening to me?

20:32.671 --> 20:35.606
God help me, I am.

20:37.676 --> 20:39.667
Steven.

20:42.914 --> 20:45.940
So that's what an adulteress is.

20:46.017 --> 20:49.180
I always thought
that it was a tiny adult.

20:51.189 --> 20:56.092
Hey, uh- Hey, buddy, what do you say we
take this party back to the living room, huh?

20:56.161 --> 20:58.425
Um, yeah, that's a good idea.

20:58.496 --> 21:00.930
No, but I want
a peanut butter and banana-

21:00.999 --> 21:02.967
( Chuckling )

21:03.034 --> 21:05.161
Why is Hyde kissin'Jackie?

21:12.510 --> 21:15.343
What the hell?

21:15.413 --> 21:17.381
He's dead.

21:26.291 --> 21:29.749
They have a lot of questions
in the D.M.V. application.

21:29.828 --> 21:32.092
Let's see.
''Sex''?

21:33.098 --> 21:35.259
Please.
( Giggles )

21:36.568 --> 21:38.866
Lots.

21:38.937 --> 21:40.871
''Address''?

21:40.939 --> 21:43.430
If I must, but I prefer pants.

21:45.910 --> 21:47.844
''State''?

21:47.912 --> 21:49.903
Nervous but excited.

21:51.149 --> 21:53.709
''Mother's maiden name''?

21:53.785 --> 21:56.276
Streisand, but she
won't acknowledge me.
