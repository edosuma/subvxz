We have a new student
who has just transferred

03:02.599 --> 03:06.012
into our class today, Ms. Jane bradshaw.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.305
Please say, "hello!

03:12.609 --> 03:15.897
Class, I have some instructions
for you on fire drills.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.063
I have some instructions
for you on fire drills,

03:20.075 --> 03:22.487
so please get out your
paper and take them down.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.861
Mr. Cohen, you're late.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.782
No, I'm not.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.577
Ms. molina, I just saw the
principal in the hallway

03:31.044 --> 03:32.705
oh, all right now class,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.499
I have to go to the principal's office.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.498
But before I go, Mr. Cohen
is passing out these sheets

03:37.509 --> 03:40.592
of yellow paper, and I want you
to put your last name first,

03:40.595 --> 03:42.677
and then your first name last at the top,

03:42.681 --> 03:44.217
followed by today's date

03:44.224 --> 03:45.760
and the period that you are here,

03:45.767 --> 03:48.008
which for your information is home room.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.307
Now, I'll be just, now,
I'll be right back.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.225
So please have those sheets filled out.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.437
She comes.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.907
Mr. Cohen, where is my chalk?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.874
Why don't you take a look
in your desk, Ms. molina?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.368
You may find some chalk there.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.636
Mr. rosiello, Mr. ragallo, Mr. Tyrell,

05:10.644 --> 05:13.681
I am separating the three
of you for your own good.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.475
Mr. rosiello, you come
right up here in front of me

05:16.483 --> 05:18.144
and Mr. murgalo, you sit in the last row

05:18.151 --> 05:19.641
by the blackboard.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.653
Where's Mr. Tyrell?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.654
You stay there.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.898
Ah, thank you.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.484
Mr. rosiello.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.486
Come on up here, Mr. rosiello.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.206
I am keeping you separated like this

05:35.210 --> 05:37.201
so you don't have any more
of that delinquent behavior

05:37.212 --> 05:38.418
that we've had in the past.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.752
Is that clear?

05:42.884 --> 05:43.964
Sit down!

05:43.969 --> 05:45.379
Copy this information down.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.847
Mr. rosiello, what do
you think you are doing?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.143
Well, there just seemed to be a draft

05:59.150 --> 05:59.980
all across that seat.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.816
I just thought I'd move back
so I wouldn't get in the draft.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.277
All right, but just don't
make me throw you out.

06:04.281 --> 06:09.275
No, no, I won't do none of that.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.038
Another draft, Mr. rosiello?

06:15.041 --> 06:15.871
I don't know what it is.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.706
I don't know what it is.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.120
Wherever I sit, there seems to be a draft.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.493
Either that, or the sunlight's in my eyes.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.416
You don't mind if I
move back here, do you?

06:22.424 --> 06:23.630
Sit down.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.716
Now, if you will all settle
down and stop moving about,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.631
maybe we could learn something today.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.344
- Oh, I hope so.
- Don't you agree?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.806
Get out of here.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.148
Get out of here!

06:45.780 --> 06:47.236
And don't come back
until you have a letter

06:47.240 --> 06:49.151
from your mother, do you hear me?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.952
Butchey and wimpy, I'll see
you at the dodge ball game.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.039
And I'll see you too sweet meat.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.350
Will Victoria reveal
her plans to heaven...

07:25.362 --> 07:26.727
- Hi ya, David.
- Hey, ma.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.365
Oh, wow.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.275
Why don't you drink that out of a glass?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.617
It's a glass.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.781
I'm making a sandwich.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.029
Oh, blackout, oh.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.076
Don't eat cake, I'm making you sandwich.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.199
I don't want a sandwich.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.370
You're gonna ruin your appetite.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.413
No, I'm not.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.660
You're gonna ruin your teeth.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.502
No.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.621
I'm gon' ruin my face.

07:46.925 --> 07:47.755
- David.
- Goodbye, ma.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.589
I gotta go.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.504
What do you mean you
gotta, you just came in.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.423
I know, I gotta
go, I'm in a rush, okay?

07:52.430 --> 07:54.261
I'm expecting you home for supper.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.847
Okay, don't
worry ma, I'll be there.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.927
Let's go, let's go.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.307
Come on.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.230
Strike one, right over there.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.193
Strike one, right?

08:09.197 --> 08:10.482
Strike, he was right over the plate.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.902
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.249
Why don't you put an egg
in your shoe and beat it?

08:31.261 --> 08:32.467
Scram, honey!

08:34.347 --> 08:35.347
Dork!

08:37.433 --> 08:39.015
- Hi, Stanley.
- Hi, chico.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.179
- How are you.
- Hey baby, how are you doing?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.893
You know what I just bought.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.727
What?

08:43.732 --> 08:44.972
Great new outfit for tonight.

08:47.902 --> 08:48.732
Annie, come on.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.523

- Yeah, yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.021
I'll see you tonight, chico.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.638
Nice shot.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.727
Thanks.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.471
You wanna play a little nine-ball?

09:26.483 --> 09:27.814
Book a throw?

09:27.817 --> 09:29.102
Rack 'em up, I'll break.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.700
Yeah, I'm a take a deuce in the caboose.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.042
Are you sure you're the same way?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.929
Before or out the back door.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.218
Hey, what kind of a thing is that?

10:46.229 --> 10:47.514
The lords.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.638
What is it, a club or something?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.187
Yeah, it's what you might
call a social athletic club.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.776
We play a little ball, bust a few heads.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.863
Ever hear of the jays?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.078
No, where are you from?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.491
Avenue j.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.955
Oh yeah, I actually can remember

11:07.959 --> 11:09.995
hearing about that.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.163
You know, we broke up.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.877
What, did you have a lover's quarrel?

11:12.881 --> 11:15.463
You know, you remind me
of a guy I used to know.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.081
He used to be in the jays.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.256
Little, short guy, we
used to call him mouse.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.217
What are you gonna call a
little fella named mouse.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.304
He's only five foot three.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.264
Yeah, well let me tell you something.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.476
First of all, I'm not five
foot three, I'm five foot six.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.595
And second of all, it ain't the size, man,

11:30.607 --> 11:33.019
it's whether or not you
got balls, you know?

11:33.026 --> 11:33.890
You're 100% right.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.858
You got balls, you got
nothing to worry about.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.773
That's right.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.855
You look like you can
handle yourself pretty good.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.404
Yeah, I do all right.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.402
I do better in groups,
you know what I mean?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.744
I like to know if I get in trouble,

11:46.748 --> 11:48.488
I could snap my fingers, man,

11:48.499 --> 11:50.285
and the lords come out running.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.784
Like I feel good around
my friend, Stanley,

11:52.795 --> 11:55.707
he's what you call, my insurance.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.297
- Hey, wimp.
- Hey, Stan.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.541
Where'd you go?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.508
Here you go, pool player.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.379
I didn't get your name, man.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.801
What's your name.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.764
You can call me moose for now,

12:07.769 --> 12:09.305
everybody calls me mambo.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.896
Oh, moose mambo, this is
Stanley and this is chico.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.435
Moose, huh?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.272
Mambo!

12:15.276 --> 12:16.311
If you're moose, the rest of your pants

12:16.319 --> 12:18.355
must be cured, huh moose?

12:18.363 --> 12:19.227
What do you mean by that?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.649
Pay no attention to the fake dude,

12:20.657 --> 12:21.487
you know what I mean?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.697
He don't know what he's talking about.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.815
Hey, not the time to dig,
I threaten you in life.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.032
I forget, you know?

12:25.036 --> 12:27.072
Hey chic, you ever hear of the jays, man?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.697
Yeah, it's a bird, man.

12:33.169 --> 12:33.999
You know, if he was on Avenue Jay,

12:34.003 --> 12:35.083
he wouldn't talk like that.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.080
Yeah, well I'll tell you
something about avenues Jay,

12:38.091 --> 12:39.627
I eat avenues Jay.

12:42.679 --> 12:47.048
Hey moose, what say you and
me play a little game of pool?

12:47.058 --> 12:47.888
Good idea.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.892
Yeah, I'll rack 'em up.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.182
Flat hours to throw, right?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.189
Good.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.108
Go ahead and break.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.602
Give me my dollar back.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.163
I think it's my shot.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.781
Normally it would be.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.416
This ain't no game for me, man.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.164
But here we play by my rules.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.466
You lose a fin.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.008
Listen, I'll see you guys around.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.016
Hey!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.717

You, you!

21:27.828 --> 21:28.828
You!

21:30.539 --> 21:34.157
You are the one who's
pregnant, not me, you!

21:41.008 --> 21:41.838
I'm one week, frannie.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.207
We're not so these other guys.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.718
You know there's nobody else.

21:48.432 --> 21:53.426
Yeah, I know, I know.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.053
Damn!

21:56.065 --> 21:57.065
Why didn't you pray?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.349
How would you like to

Come on.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.916
But frannie, are you sure about this?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.289
Yeah Stanley, I'm sure.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.464
What am I gonna tell my mother?

22:27.471 --> 22:28.881
I don't know.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.845
What do I say to the priest in confession?

22:30.850 --> 22:31.680
I don't know.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.675
What kind of clothes am
I gonna wear to school?

22:34.895 --> 22:35.895
I don't know.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.522
Listen, listen to me.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.767
I know a guy who,

22:47.408 --> 22:52.243
who knows a guy downtown that
usually handles these things.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.494
I don't wanna be a father.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.258
Do you understand, I
don't wanna be a father.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.242
I told you, I don't wanna be a father.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.460
But you're old enough to make me pregnant.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.763
And to go in the army.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.129
America wouldn't have to
go in the army, would it?

23:46.133 --> 23:48.840
Well Stanley, it could be terrific.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.300
We could get our own television

23:50.304 --> 23:52.511
and watch American dancing all the time.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.879
Then we could buy a two-family house

23:53.891 --> 23:54.755
right here in the neighborhood

23:54.767 --> 23:56.974
and my mother could move downstairs.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.217
Maybe she'd even pay the mortgage.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.640
Listen, listen to me.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.685
You sound like we've
got a license already.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.107
Fran, I don't wanna get married.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.400
Truthfully, I don't wanna get married.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.366
Besides, you're too skinny to be pregnant.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.860
You're too skinny.

24:20.918 --> 24:21.918
Stanley!

in some of her classes

26:22.956 --> 26:24.617
and that you met the other evening

26:24.625 --> 26:25.535
at the fraternity party.

Oh, look, excuse me for a moment,

26:32.174 --> 26:35.666
No, no, I belong to the lords.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.627
Well, is that a fraternity?

26:39.848 --> 26:43.386
No, it's what you might
call a social athletic club.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.303
Aha, I see.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.723
Do you play a regular
position or something?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.438
No, nothing is set.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.397
We just sort of take turns,
if you know what I mean.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.814
Oh, look who's here.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.189

I mean, what can I say?

58:48.275 --> 58:51.767

We came for it.

Let me get it.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.658
You know, all my life
I wanted to be engaged.

You know something, Stanley,

59:44.372 --> 59:47.239

girl in all of Brooklyn.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.332

- You do.

59:49.336 --> 59:51.418
Look at that ring.

59:51.421 --> 59:54.379
Oh Stanley, couldn't you just
picture that on her finger?

59:54.382 --> 59:55.747
Isn't this a beauty?

59:55.759 --> 59:56.999
Here, let me try it on.

59:57.010 --> 59:59.251
I want you to know
something about this ring.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.883
It's an investment in the future.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.927
Oh Stanley, isn't it beautiful?

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.096
This is the ring I wanted all my life.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.686
Oh Stanley, you know, they
grow more valuable in time.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.271
Can you wait a minute, Annie.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.733
Tell me something about this ring.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:19.446
Well, it's one and a half carat marquee

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:24.193
in a platinum setting with two baguettes.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.034
It's a beauty.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.038
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:28.415
Tell me about it.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.376
$1600.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:39.802
16.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.643
Hey Birnbaum, you got
something else over there,

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.939
say something about the same size.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.778
Do you have something like that, huh?

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:06.618
Yeah, I'll try and look.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:07.701
Let's get outta here.

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.947
Stanley, we can do it on the layaway plan.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.040
Stanley, you could even
have them on consignment.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:14.830
I don't want nothing
on consignment, Annie.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.123
Do me a favor, why don't you go outside

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:16.961
and run your teeth on the curb?

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:17.795
Do me a favor, would you?

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:19.835
- Very funny, Stanley.
- Don't talk to her like that,

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:20.673
Stanley, what do you think?

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.133
She's one of the boys on the corner?

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.752
Oh, but that ain't right?

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:27.130
She's my best friend and she's
gonna be my maid of honor.

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.224
That's right, Stanley.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:37.815
Who ever heard of a maid of honor

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.901
arriving on a broom, huh?

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.896
I want that ring, Stanley.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:45.195
I got a ring for you,
Fran, I got a ring for you.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.202
On my bathtub.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.166
Christ!

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.369
Tell me again, how much is it?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.171
How much is that ring?

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.005
The other ring?

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.125
This, yeah, the ring she has here.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.841
This ring is $1600.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.841
It's marked down from
$2200 and it's a steal.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.638
It's a beautiful ring.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.432
I don't want the ring, Stanley.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.599
I don't want it.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.518
I don't want it.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:18.355
Hey, will you listen to me?

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.725
Hey, you wanna calm down a minute?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:20.725
Hey, listen to me.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.068
Listen to me.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.859
I'll get you an ID bracelet
or something, all right?

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:28.700
- You cheap skank.
- You are so cheap, Stanley.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.910
Hey meatball, why don't
you go wipe your head?

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.324
I'm saving for a car.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.581
- I'm saving for a car.
- You're saving for a car?

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.699
You know, that's all you ever think of,

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.870
is money, money, money.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.414
You know something, I don't think

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.957
I'm gonna even let you
marry my girlfriend.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:41.330
- What do you think of that?
- Annie, shut up.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.832
Hey, listen to me daddy-o,
listen to me, hey.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.208
You got one of those rings,

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.801
the thing you take out for 10 days,

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:47.760
you bring back...

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:48.674
I don't want it for 10 days, Stanley.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.889
- 10 days, you don't have...
- I want it forever.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:51.927
You know what I mean, a 10-day ring.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.597
- Do you have one back there?
- Stanley, I love you.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.014
Buy me that ring.

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:20.205
All right, how much you want?

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.956
I'll take 10%, it's $160.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.798
I only have 90.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.508
Got a ring.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.598
Stanley, we're engaged.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.729
You've got real class, Stanley.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:40.813
All right, bear with me.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.182
Hey, frannie, frannie,
frannie, listen to me.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.433
Frannie, listen.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.901
Will you shut up a minute?

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:45.904
Hey frannie.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.114
Hey frannie, frannie, will
you take the ring out?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:51.983
Will you take the ring outside

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.951
and look at it in the dark or something?

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.493
Take the ring out, see if
it touch glass or something.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:03:59.907
Oh, Annie.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.535
- Oh, I don't believe it...
- It's really beautiful.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:03.787
So gorgeous.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:05.459
Just look at the color.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.458
It's a beautiful ring.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.758
Listen to me, listen daddy-o.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.680
You see that girl who
just walked out of there,

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.803
if you ever show her a $1600 ring again,

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.981
you know what's gonna be
written on your tombstone?

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.104
Do you know what's gonna be
written on your tombstone?

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:28.737
I was dumb enough to show
frannie malincanico a $1600 ring.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.984
You know what I mean?

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:34.995
Yeah?

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:50.292
Oh, looks fabulous, it's just so gorgeous.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.513
Oh, you're so lucky.

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:56.927
Did I do it?

01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.309
Stanley, this is the
happiest day of my life.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.347
Did I do it?

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.599
Stanley, it's the happiest
day of my life too.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:03.596
I can't believe it.

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:04.438
Who is the best guy in the world?

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:05.898

I'd be so much happier if
you were getting married too.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.022
But that's why I always counted on David.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.062
That's why I was so happy for you.

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.276
I always wanted a double wedding.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.816
I know, Annie.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.484
But don't worry, listen,

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.403
Stanley has a cousin in New Jersey.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:38.900
Really, he's gorgeous.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.448
Father owns a pizza place.

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:43.868
I promise I'll fix you
up with him, don't mind.

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:44.705
Okay.

You know what, Stanley just got engaged.

Congratulate him, man.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.915
Come on, go ahead.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.167
Go talk to him.

What kinda entertainment?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.601
Like putting your fist
through somebody's face, man?

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:13.442
Whose face?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:14.902

Stanley, what about you?

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.358
What about you?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.200
You gotta do it today?

Where is he?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.206
He's down at the football field.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.996
You're not going, you promised me.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:33.131
Who are you pulling?

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.089
Huh?

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.958
I wanna tell you something,

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.585
you don't ever tell me what to do,

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:39.460
and don't ever tell me what not to do.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.472
You understand me?

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:42.975

I mean, he's broken.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.593
Come here, come here.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.139
What happened to your foot?

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.557
What happened to your foot, don't scratch.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.565
Hey!

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.432
That a pretty girl, yeah.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:48.615
You know if you eat your food,

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:49.825
you know what's gonna happen to you?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:50.659
You know what's gonna happen?

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.903
You're gonna grow up to be a bald eagle.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.246
You wanna be a bald eagle, huh?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.115
Or do you wanna be a squirt?

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:57.162
What do you wanna be?

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.586
Hey, rocky marciano, how are ya?

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.796
Hey, what are you doing chic?

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.835
Not much man, I went to see butchey.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.083
How is he, how is he?

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:05.924
He's all right, man.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.338
You gonna go over and see him?

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:10.213
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.385
I don't fit in well with hospitals.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.133
You know, I'm kind of
afraid the whole thing,

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.260
I don't like it, I don't like it.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.602
How are you feeling, man?

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:17.436
I can't complain.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.772
I think I hurt my knuckle
a little bit in the fight.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.518
You know, nothin' serious but...

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.563
Hey, you mind if I come up?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.937
No, no, come on up but watch yourself.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.109
Right over here, it's a little tricky.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.653
It's a little tricky.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.740
That's it, you got it.

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:32.235
You got it, good boy!

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.949
You know, chico, I've been thinking about

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.493
getting some chickens, you know?

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.331
What for?

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:38.165
I was thinking about raising chickens.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.409
What for?

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.375
I figure this way.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.040
You know, Rhode Island chicken,

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.458
they're supposed to lay good eggs.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.206
I bet I could sell the
eggs in the neighborhood

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.334
and when these, like when
these Rhode Island chickens

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.006
get too fat to lay more
eggs, I can eat 'em.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.002
- What do you think?
- Yeah, man.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.005
You can support your family, huh?

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:52.880
Hey, she ain't pregnant.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:54.223
- Hey, she ain't?
- No, she ain't pregnant.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:56.092
Hey man, that's good, you
don't have to marry her then.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.469
No, I don't have to
marry her, but I might.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:01.775
I might.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.185
Hey chico, you know, you know
what you really gotta have

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:07.152
to raise pigeons, you know
what you really gotta have,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.647
you gotta have a think what
they call, country blood.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.614
Yeah?

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.074
Hey, like you guys, right Stanley?

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.918
Yeah, I got country blood,
I got country blood.

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:15.702
You know, when you ain't around here,

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:16.821
like when you're out there screwing around

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.245
your little motorcycle,
you know what I do?

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.332
You really wanna know what I do?

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.453
I come up here, I sit
in my Coop and I read.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:24.374
- You read, man.
- That's right, yeah.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.589
- What do you read?
- Maps.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:28.833
What the hell have maps
got to do with anything?

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:29.675
Maps got a lot to do with a lot of things.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.544
Listen, see I figure it this way,

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.387
the more maps you read, the more you know

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.346
about where you wanna go.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.433
Like, what I do is, you pick a place,

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.926
any place in this whole stinking world.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.020
You pick a place, and I'll
show you you ain't so smart.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.354
- Go ahead.
- All right, man.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.188
Tokyo!

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.728
All right, Tokyo, good start.

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:45.520
Here's what we do.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.359
First, you got up a 10-year pigeon.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.900
Now, you look that way
and you close your eyes.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.113
Now, go on.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.948
Now, pretend you're flying

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:53.782
and you're flying, and you're flying.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.742
You're going farther,
and farther, and farther

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:56.576
and farther out.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:58.913
Now, right here, chico, you look down.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:12:59.780
Look down, chico.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.328
Do you see what's down there?

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:02.165
Look what's down there, chico.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:03.284
Look, look.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.207
Yeah, man, I see what's down there.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.670
I see pigeon shit.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.086
Oh, come on man, listen to me.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.924
Do you wanna do it or not?

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.418
Now, you're a pigeon, okay?

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.261
All right, now shut
your eyes dude, come on.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:15.095
Watch me.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.464
You're going and you're
flying and you're flying,

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.385
you're going over the mountains,

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.553
you're going over the ocean,

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.516
and your arms are getting tired

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.635
and you're going farther and farther.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.136
Now raise your ear, chico.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.012
Raise your ear.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.139
Look down, man.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.607
Look down, do you see what's down there?

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:28.818
Chinks, chinks.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:29.685
Do you know what that means, man?

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.858
Chinks, you're in Tokyo,
man, we're in Tokyo.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:32.696
Get out, man.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.816
We're not in Tokyo, we're on the roof.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.030
We're on the roof, man.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:37.868
Don't you see?

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:38.861
We're not in Tokyo.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.409
I'm in Tokyo.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.280
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:42.202
Well, what's it look like, Stanley?

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:44.120
What's it smell like in Tokyo?

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:47.661
What's the matter, chico, huh?

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.503
Your bike broke, what's
the matter with you?

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:49.792
Hey, man, that's the point.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.006
That's the one point, man.

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:51.965
I got a bike.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.334
I can go places, man.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.176
I can go places.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.761
That's the whole thing,
that's the whole thing.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.972
You see, I don't need a
bike to go any place, chico.

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:00.432
To go places, I mean,
man, to really go places,

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.427
you gotta have imagination.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.518
I got imagination,

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:04.352
- you aint' got nothing.
- You can have

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:05.187
all the imagination you want, man.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.477
You're never gonna see no chinks in Tokyo.

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:08.941
This would be after speaking a lie.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.685
I know what I do and you
don't know what I do.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:11.776
If I say I've been to Tokyo,

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.692
I've been to Tokyo and
nobody can tell me different.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:14.984
I'll tell you something else, chico.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.152
I don't like you coming up here

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.401
telling me what I can
do and what I can't do.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.242
Do you understand?

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.577
'Cause I see right through you.

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.037
I'm gonna tell you one more thing, man.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.497
You're trying to make me feel bad.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.866
- Don't tell me.
- You're gonna be pigeon shit,

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:25.992
man, you got that?

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:27.584
You're gonna be pigeon shit.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:37.837
Hey, chico!

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.088
Chico!

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.432
I'm gonna forget that, chico.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.891
Chico, you know why?

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:43.725
Do you?

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:44.889
You know why?

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:45.727
'Cause if I don't forget that,

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.267
you're gonna be unmarried, chico.

01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:49.481
You're gonna be unmarried,
you hear me chico?

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.727
You're gonna be unmarried, you hear me?

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.279
- Stanley?
- What do you want?

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.530
What's wrong?

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.495
I'll be right down, Fran.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:13.797
Wait a minute, will ya?

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.666
I wanna talk to you.

I just wanna talk to
you for a few minutes.

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:18.423
Come on, wait.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.843
I want to go home.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.341
You're not gonna go until you talk to me.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.185
All right, what do you wanna talk about?

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.975
>You and me »

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.814

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:31.853
and I just wanted you to know...

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.897
Chico, look, I think I know
what you're talking about.

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:34.814
No, no, wait a minute.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:35.777
You don't know what I'm talking about.

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.864
Just, let me tell you
what I'm talking about.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.358
We had something between us.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.822
It was better than anything...

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.661
Chico, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.951
- I didn't say I got hurt.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:48.290
I'm not talking about getting hurt.

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:49.124
I don't care about that.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:49.958
I don't care whether you're sorry.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.668
I just wanna tell you...

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:54.038
Chico, just can't we be friends?

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:56.874
Can't we just be friends?

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.009
J it's gettin' late j»

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.174
