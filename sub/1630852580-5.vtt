WEBVTT

00:09.309 --> 00:12.212
Today I have not
the greatest news.

00:12.312 --> 00:16.249
A reminder for all the guests
at the Second Chance Retreat --

00:16.349 --> 00:19.686
if you don't have a connection,
you can be sent home.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.588
So I am sad to say...

00:21.688 --> 00:25.392
after a lot
of careful consideration,

00:25.492 --> 00:27.394
somebody has to
leave the retreat

00:27.494 --> 00:28.862
in order to make room

00:28.928 --> 00:32.098
to create new opportunities
for the rest of you.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.504
The dad leaving
the retreat today is...

00:40.006 --> 00:44.244
It was honestly
really hard to nominate

00:44.344 --> 00:46.212
an amazing dad to go home.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.214
I don't want anybody to go home.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.251
...Phill.

00:52.419 --> 00:57.190
Ooh. Aww!

00:57.257 --> 00:58.858
It's okay.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.728
I'm sorry, man.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.799
I'm sorry that
you have not found love

01:05.899 --> 01:07.233
here at
the Second Chance Retreat,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.269
but I know that you have
found friends.

01:09.369 --> 01:10.703
I have.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.039
And we hope that you continue
your love journey.

01:13.106 --> 01:17.077
It's sad to go, but I understand
it's a love retreat,

01:17.143 --> 01:22.615
and I am grateful for the time,
opportunity, and the adventure.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.287
This fucking sucks.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.989
I personally believe,
and as we all believe,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.891
you have love out there
waiting for you.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.326
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.895
So I'm gonna leave
and allow you to take your time

01:35.962 --> 01:37.964
to say goodbye
to your friends.

01:38.064 --> 01:38.965
Okay.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.600
- Aww.
- Oh, my God.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.835
Well...

01:41.935 --> 01:43.303
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:43.403 --> 01:44.838
You're an amazing man.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.439
It's been good. You're
an amazing person yourself.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.776
- Birthday girl!
- I know. Really? On my birthday.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.478
- ...leaving.
- I know!

01:51.578 --> 01:54.280
I do love you so much.
I love you.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.950
Oh, Phill, thank you
so much for opening up to me.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.519
I mean, I know that you --
I mean, you came out of your

01:59.619 --> 02:01.654
comfort zone,
I mean, for all of us.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.957
It's something that I know
that you wouldn't have done.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.493
And so just trust that
we are still here for you

02:06.593 --> 02:09.496
and we know that
you're gonna find love.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.499
I am devastated that Phill
is leaving the retreat.

02:12.599 --> 02:16.836
I'm kind of liking Scott,
and this is making me realize

02:16.936 --> 02:20.006
that I should put myself
out there a little bit more,

02:20.106 --> 02:25.678
be a little bit more vulnerable
to show him that I like him.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.148
I'm gonna miss every single
one of you guys.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.683
It's been great
being with you guys...

02:30.783 --> 02:33.019
and the connections
we all built together.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.855
This fucking sucks, Miles.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.725
- Come on.
- Ah, it sucks.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.028
It's gonna be so weird
without you.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.663
Who's supposed to
mess with us?

02:43.730 --> 02:46.799
I know!
I'm gonna miss you so much.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.468
We're all gonna
go to Miami.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.836
We're gonna go to Miami!

02:49.903 --> 02:51.905
I promise you guys.
Gonna take you all of Miami.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.840
All right?
Bre? Come on, Bre.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.508
This is so sad.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.912
It is so emotional because we're
all best friends in this house,

02:59.012 --> 03:02.849
and I just don't want to send
one of my best friends home.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.886
- Well, lifelong friends.
- Exactly.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.555
Bunk --
Bunk buddies for life.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.558
It's gonna be so weird
without you here, man.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.226
What's the first thing
you're gonna do

03:13.326 --> 03:14.694
when you get back
to civilization?

03:14.761 --> 03:16.496
I'm gonna go hang out
with my son.

03:16.563 --> 03:17.997
That's what
I'm looking forward to.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.365
That's all
that's on my mind.

03:19.432 --> 03:20.934
Hey, bro.
I got a present for you, bro.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.269
You need you a chain
from Miami, bro.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.238
- You need you a chain.
- I'm not acce-- No, no, no.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.574
- You need you a chain, bro.
- Seriously. Bro.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.043
Bro. Are you serious?

03:30.109 --> 03:32.579
Yeah, bro.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.348
You guys are serious--
You guys seriously mean
so much to me.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.883
I'm definitely --
This will remind me

03:36.950 --> 03:38.351
of every single one of you guys.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.387
It's heartbreaking to see
everyone really sad.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.023
I feel like we all had
really great connections.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.259
This experience
helped me learn to, like,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.695
open up to everyone
and change for the better.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.930
From not -- From saying
a total of eight words

03:51.030 --> 03:52.432
the entire first day to now.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.068
You just can't stop talking
about Miami or whatever.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.936
But I'm glad
you came onto the show, bro.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.605
It was awesome
getting to know you.

03:58.705 --> 03:59.772
It's not gonna be the same, bro.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.107
It's not gonna be the same.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.377
It's not a goodbye.
It's a "see you later."

04:05.878 --> 04:10.049
I have made such a strong
connection with my roomies

04:10.116 --> 04:12.986
because we had tough childhoods

04:13.086 --> 04:15.288
based on our parents
being divorced.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.957
Even though we're all so
different, we're all so alike.

04:18.057 --> 04:22.629
We may be getting more from this
experience than our parents.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.800
Everyone thinks
they know what they want,

04:27.900 --> 04:29.302
but they never really sit down

04:29.402 --> 04:31.104
and think about it
in that sense.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.806
And being here gave me the time,
the opportunity.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.309
Being around different people
and different women

04:36.409 --> 04:38.811
just made you realize think
deeper in what you want.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.948
So I appreciate that,
and I'm thankful for that.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.185
My experience
at the Second Chance Retreat

04:46.286 --> 04:47.687
has been great, wonderful.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.356
I wouldn't change a thing
because it helped me

04:50.456 --> 04:53.926
come out of my shell,
and I met some wonderful people.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.795
I met some wonderful friends.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.621
Dad.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.024
It's been a while.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.795
How have you been?

05:28.861 --> 05:31.397
- Good. How you been?
- I've been doing good.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.533
How's your experience?

05:33.633 --> 05:34.567
Well...

05:36.202 --> 05:39.138
Ohh. Oh, my God.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.642
So you guys
have been watching us.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.043
Yeah, we've been...

05:44.143 --> 05:45.812
- All this time.
- Fly on the wall.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.213
It's been crazy.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.483
I was shocked.
I'm like, "Wow."

05:50.550 --> 05:52.552
So where you guys monitoring us
from day one? I'm assuming.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.654
Since day one, yeah.
We had to make, like,

05:54.721 --> 05:56.255
all these, like,
decisions on, like...

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
Like, who should
my parent go after?

05:58.424 --> 05:59.926
Yeah, but even more than that.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.694
Like, on the dates,
you had to, like,

06:01.761 --> 06:03.896
pick certain activities
for them to do.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.100
Like that massage
that you had to do.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.267
That massage.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.435
That was you? Wow.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.337
Once the rest of the parents
find out

06:11.404 --> 06:12.872
what the kids are doing --

06:12.939 --> 06:14.674
manipulating
and pulling strings --

06:14.741 --> 06:16.909
ah, they're gonna have
a good laugh.

06:17.009 --> 06:20.213
They're gonna be embarrassed
maybe, but a good laugh.

06:20.279 --> 06:22.115
They're talking
about you.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.451
I'm gonna miss that dance.
His dance.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.086
Yeah, last night,
he was getting down!

06:27.186 --> 06:28.521
Yeah, he was
getting down!

06:28.588 --> 06:30.056
Getting down
with the get-down.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.392
He was the cream in the middle
of the cookies.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.060
Oh, my God.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.928
- Feels like the band broke up.
- There's no taking his place.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.630
There's no taking his place.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.265
Yeah. No. Yeah.
He's irreplaceable.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.434
Yeah. He's a frickin
great guy, man.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.535
He is.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.270
I definitely learned
a lot about you.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.805
I can imagine.
You spying on me.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.875
Being a fly on the wall
and seeing everything you do.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.576
But it looked like
you were having a blast

06:50.643 --> 06:52.612
and having a great time,
So that made me happy.

06:52.712 --> 06:53.780
Oh, thank you.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.615
Overall, I think
just being here

06:55.715 --> 06:58.418
just made me realize
how much I appreciate yourself

06:58.484 --> 07:01.754
and the relationship
we have.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.790
Right. I definitely think
this was a great experience

07:03.890 --> 07:06.325
a wonderful
bonding experience.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.162
Even though we weren't
really together.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.997
We weren't together,
but we were, like, together.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.332
We're just having a good time
and laughing about the things.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.134
I definitely feel like
there's gonna be a change

07:15.234 --> 07:17.637
in the relationship with my dad,
and it's gonna be way more open

07:17.737 --> 07:19.939
in the sense that we can really
talk about anything now.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.741
I feel like after this,
he's definitely gonna be

07:21.808 --> 07:24.811
more supportive of me being
in a relationship and whatnot.

07:24.911 --> 07:28.114
That's gonna be great.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.316
Brother Phill.
How you doing, man?

07:30.416 --> 07:31.784
This is the squad
right here.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.619
- How you doing, man?
- I'm pretty good.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.121
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.789
- This is Whitney.
- Nice meeting you.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.424
These are the dating
consultants, essentially.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.827
Yeah, we've been watching you,
like, pretty much 24/7.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.428
Yeah, all the moves.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.631
Your son has been our comic
relief for the week so far.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.000
Miles is definitely the life
of the party out of all --

07:48.100 --> 07:49.769
Like, we're gonna miss him
so much.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.437
Like, he was
the main man.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.306
- Seriously?
- You know how I am.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.709
All right, guys.
I'm gonna miss all you guys.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.145
Leaving the house
is definitely unfortunate,

07:59.212 --> 08:01.314
but I feel like I learned
a lot about my dad

08:01.380 --> 08:03.316
and how he works
in those kind of situations.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.018
What I feel like my dad really
took out of this experience

08:06.118 --> 08:07.954
was getting out of his shell
a lot faster,

08:08.020 --> 08:10.056
as it seems like
once he gets out of his shell,

08:10.156 --> 08:12.458
everyone seemed to love him,
that he was an amazing guy.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.994
And he's an amazing dad to me,
so I just hope my dad

08:15.061 --> 08:17.864
doesn't give up and
finds what he really wants.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.877
Can we have, like,
a party in memory?

08:30.977 --> 08:34.213
In memoriam?
Celebration of Miles.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.083
I was sad, though, because
I felt like we all knew.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.051
I literally bawled
my eyes all night. Like, I'm --

08:39.151 --> 08:41.420
Yeah, I have a headache
from bawling so much,
like, literally,

08:41.520 --> 08:45.358
Even though I do not like
sending Phill and Miles home,

08:45.424 --> 08:47.860
I think it will,
in the parents' house,

08:47.927 --> 08:50.062
will create more connections.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.567
So what are we
meddling with this time?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.003
"Tonight, your parents
will be throwing a party

08:57.069 --> 08:59.405
to help celebrate
Patricia's birthday."

09:02.008 --> 09:03.910
"Destiny, Alex & Brennen.

09:04.010 --> 09:08.614
In order to meddle this evening,
you must blow up 100 balloons

09:08.714 --> 09:10.416
to help with decorations.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.885
Do you wish to proceed?
Yes or no?"

09:12.952 --> 09:14.053
- Yes!
- Of course.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.254
I'm good. Yes.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.961
...to think of
a tactic. Do a hundred.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.231
100 divided by three people,
How many is that apiece?

09:27.366 --> 09:29.235
- 33-ish.
- Oh, okay.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.937
Brennen:
If something that I do,

09:31.037 --> 09:33.706
a little sacrifice I make
gets her a step closer

09:33.773 --> 09:35.608
towards making
a deeper connection,

09:35.708 --> 09:37.143
then, yeah, it's not a big deal.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.111
They're already done with one.
You're still working on one.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.614
And it's deflating.
Look at that.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.316
Alex, you're gonna
have to pull your weight.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.253
I'm trying!
Okay, okay.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.627
Brennen:
I'm getting lightheaded.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.062
I've blown up
the most balloons.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.229
- Oh, no.
- Yes, I have.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.631
You have not.
Are you out of your mind?

09:58.731 --> 10:00.099
I have blown up
more than you guys.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.802
I'm a machine.
I'm absolutely a machine.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.103
I actually did all of the work.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.339
I just want to
point that out there.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.575
Whitney:
So, this is the last balloon.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.478
PJ, are you content
down there?

10:12.578 --> 10:14.080
Happy birthday, Trish.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.150
Ahh.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.458
I will say, Troy.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.326
I am glad it looks like
you and I

10:27.426 --> 10:29.795
and the ladies
we've been spending time with

10:29.862 --> 10:32.031
might be safe
from elimination.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.366
Could be.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.867
I wouldn't want to be here
without you, to be honest.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.869
I wouldn't, either, man,
It would not in any way,

10:36.969 --> 10:38.504
shape, or form
be the same for me.

10:38.604 --> 10:39.839
Yeah.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.974
Here we are.
It's Trish's birthday.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.011
Everybody is deflated,
particularly the six of us

10:45.111 --> 10:47.546
who have been here
since day one,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.048
getting to know Phill.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.451
So now what I want to happen
is to really appreciate

10:52.518 --> 10:54.520
every second
that I get to be here

10:54.620 --> 10:58.824
and focus on my connection
with Deneia.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.292
- Jimmy?!
- Hey, guys.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.862
What surprises
do you bring this time?

11:02.962 --> 11:06.165
It is a very special birthday,

11:06.232 --> 11:08.234
so I wanted
to give Patricia this!

11:11.504 --> 11:13.172
- Ohh!
- Aww!

11:13.239 --> 11:15.307
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.709
- Thank you.
- Yes.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.911
That's so sweet.
Aww. Thank you.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.413
I'll see you guys.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.515
Aww. It even has
my name in it.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.318
- Aww.
- Aww.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.020
"Happy birthday, Patricia.

11:28.087 --> 11:32.058
The dating consultants want you
all to enjoy a night of fun.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.060
And..."

11:34.160 --> 11:36.362
I ain't got my glasses on.
Hold on.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.730
"Fun and frivolity."

11:37.830 --> 11:39.398
Oh, good, 'cause I was like,
"What word is that?"

11:39.498 --> 11:40.599
Yes. We have to
have frivolity.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.735
Ahh! Superhero Party!

11:42.835 --> 11:43.736
Okay!

11:46.072 --> 11:47.239
Oh, shoot!

11:47.339 --> 11:48.908
They're having
a superhero party?

11:49.008 --> 11:50.409
Yeah! Okay. That's fun.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.344
Okay. I'm getting --
Okay. I'm gonna cry now.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.280
Now I'm excited 'cause
we're about to go down.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.115
We're talking parties now.
Okay.

11:56.215 --> 12:00.886
"Your mask can help you open up
and show a different side of you

12:00.953 --> 12:03.422
to your potential matches.
Enjoy."

12:03.522 --> 12:04.790
Oh, my gosh.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.292
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

12:06.392 --> 12:07.927
Oh, A Trish party is all fun.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.528
Trish party is music.

12:09.595 --> 12:14.567
Trish Party is laughing, loving,
bonding, like, opening up.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.204
So I just -- I'm extremely
excited about tonight.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.072
This is gonna be fun.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.774
I ain't even gonna cry no more.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.909
What are you looking forward to
during your mom's birthday, huh?

12:23.976 --> 12:26.812
I hope that they are dancing
and partying up

12:26.912 --> 12:30.249
and she's got her wine
and she's living it up.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.918
We know your mom is gonna
have super-strong powers

12:32.985 --> 12:34.286
'cause she's a strong woman.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.289
She's the strongest woman
I've ever seen in my life.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.291
I hope she enjoys
her balloons.

12:39.391 --> 12:40.726
Yes. Yeah.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.612
Oh, Trish!

13:04.183 --> 13:06.619
My superhero name
is Confi-Diva.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.121
Ohh!

13:09.188 --> 13:10.856
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.160
I don't have confidence
until I put my outfit on,

13:14.260 --> 13:16.996
and then I become Confi-Diva
and can get any man.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.599
- She's so gorgeous!
- So beautiful.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.201
- Yes.
- Look at that sparkle!

13:22.301 --> 13:24.703
I think this is the best thing
I've ever seen in my life.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.706
Balloons. Wow.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.508
Balloons!
She noticed the balloons!

13:29.608 --> 13:31.677
- That's you guys.
- She noticed the balloons!

13:31.777 --> 13:36.982
Oh, yeah. Superheroes.
Yeah. Whoo. Super great.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.517
All the parents are dressing up.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.153
I just hope to God Troy's
not wearing, like, tights

13:41.220 --> 13:42.354
or anything.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.356
That'll be uncomfortable
for everyone.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.158
Can't wait for it.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.862
Oh, my God.
That's Troy.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.497
Holy -- What?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.532
Oh, dude. He looks
kind of cool honestly.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.835
- Is he a doctor or something?
- I don't know, dude.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.370
My superhero name
is Captain Communicator.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.372
My mission tonight
is to help people have fluid,

14:00.472 --> 14:03.142
comfortable conversations
with everybody at the party.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.410
I love it!

14:04.510 --> 14:06.212
- How you doing?
- You look so good!

14:06.312 --> 14:07.513
So do you.

14:10.816 --> 14:11.851
Oh, my goodness.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.919
- Oh, my God!
- Is that Deneia?!

14:14.019 --> 14:16.088
Look at Deneia!

14:16.188 --> 14:18.490
My alter ego is Electra Dee.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.893
Trish:
She just lit up this room!

14:20.993 --> 14:23.896
Oh, she looks so cute!

14:23.996 --> 14:28.000
Tonight my mission is
to electrify all these men.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.436
I'm just kidding. I want Scott.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.206
Dude, what?!

14:34.273 --> 14:36.075
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.577
Oh, he looks
sick as fuck!

14:38.677 --> 14:41.547
Tonight, I'm Mind Mavin.

14:41.614 --> 14:46.118
Mind Mavin is gonna show this
beautiful young lady Deneia...

14:46.218 --> 14:48.520
No, I don't know what
he's gonna show her.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.055
He's thinking about it, though.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.593
Oh, yeah.
He is wearing tights.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.062
My alter ego is J-Flash.

14:57.129 --> 15:01.100
He looks like a real...
He looks like a real superhero!

15:01.200 --> 15:03.535
I don't want to see that.
Ever again.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.437
I'm definitely a little
shooken up right now.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.407
I'm hoping this is just
another memory I suppress.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.279
Oh...my...God!

15:13.379 --> 15:15.381
- Stop it!
- Oh, my God!

15:15.447 --> 15:18.083
My alter ego is
The Unsheltered Hero.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.619
- Is that really his body?
- No, I think it's a shirt.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.721
- Are we sure?
- It does look like his body.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.556
It looked really real
for a second.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.625
I thought
the same thing.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.929
So my mission tonight
is to step it up

15:29.995 --> 15:32.598
and step to one of these ladies

15:32.665 --> 15:34.633
and show them
what I'm really about.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.403
- Wow! Look at you!
- Lady Liberty.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.638
You just picked me up...

15:39.738 --> 15:41.473
He could have wore
just his regular

15:41.573 --> 15:43.676
and not even had the shirt
because his real muscles

15:43.776 --> 15:45.611
are better-looking
than the shirt!

15:48.013 --> 15:50.282
- Yes, Karen!
- Oh, my...

15:51.317 --> 15:54.119
What are you thinking?

15:54.186 --> 15:55.955
Dude. Holy shit.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.423
Karen looks incredible.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.096
Sorry, Karen. I know you're
hanging out with my dad,

16:04.163 --> 16:08.000
but just I couldn't --
I can't help but notice.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.837
My superhero name
is Harmonious Vixen.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.506
Ohh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:14.606 --> 16:16.775
- Yeah!
- Wow!

16:16.842 --> 16:18.978
You look amazing.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.780
- Ow!
- All right!

16:24.550 --> 16:27.987
Okay, Kiki! Okay, Kiki!

16:28.053 --> 16:30.189
My superhero name is Sawu.

16:30.289 --> 16:33.692
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

16:33.792 --> 16:35.194
And who are you?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.329
My name is Sawu,
and it's a greeting that says

16:37.396 --> 16:39.732
"I see you. I can see
your heart and your mind."

16:39.832 --> 16:41.166
Wow!

16:41.233 --> 16:43.969
So I'm gonna focus my attention
on Philip tonight.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.872
Sawu will see him,
and he will see me.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.544
That's a whole lot of leather.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.013
Whoo!

16:56.682 --> 16:59.818
My mom likes to party.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.086
Philip:
And who might we ask...

17:01.186 --> 17:04.656
I'm Metal Mama!
I'm strong as steel!

17:04.723 --> 17:07.860
- Metal Mama?
- Metal Mama.

17:07.926 --> 17:10.229
How's the jacket?
Does it spin?

17:10.329 --> 17:11.730
- Okay.
- Wshooh!

17:11.830 --> 17:13.232
Okay.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.869
Electra Dee, also known
as Deneia, she looks stunning.

17:16.935 --> 17:20.005
She just lights me up.
I can feel the electricity.

17:20.072 --> 17:21.540
That was cute.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.841
That's adorable.

17:22.908 --> 17:24.076
Oh, God.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.744
Tips of the trade.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.784
I'll tell you --
not many guys can rock that,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.118
but you rocking it.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.754
Ohh.
Ask me how I can help.

17:35.854 --> 17:38.924
Yeah. Whatever you need.
I mean, I'm here for you.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.793
So, Captain Communicator's
mission tonight

17:40.893 --> 17:43.028
is to ask Karen
a few special questions,

17:43.095 --> 17:44.463
things she's never been asked.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.697
What is your name?

17:45.764 --> 17:48.300
- Harmonious Vixen.
- Whoa.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.935
I like that
second part a lot.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.638
What do you do? You sing to
people, make 'em real happy?

17:52.738 --> 17:56.075
No, we just get on the dance
floor real sultry and sexy.

17:56.141 --> 17:59.244
Oh, okay. I see.
Do you like my mask, though?

17:59.311 --> 18:00.712
- I do.
- It's sexy?

18:00.779 --> 18:02.815
- It is.
- I like your eyes tonight.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.049
They're sparkly and fun.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.451
- Are they?
- And exciting.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.953
- Oh.
- They're precious.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.789
If I'm being quite honest,
I was concerned

18:10.889 --> 18:13.959
about this connection
between my mom and Troy.

18:14.059 --> 18:17.796
But now I love Troy.
He's an amazing guy.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.732
I couldn't ask for anyone better
with my mom,

18:20.799 --> 18:22.835
and I think they can be
a really good match

18:22.935 --> 18:24.436
outside of the retreat.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.806
Oh, my God. I like the way
that feels, whatever this is.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.976
Oh, my God.
I don't want to see that at all.

18:31.076 --> 18:34.113
Look at them!
Look at -- Aah!

18:34.179 --> 18:36.315
- Okay, Karen.
- All right.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.984
- Whoa.
- All right.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.120
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.855
Oh, I love them.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.291
Looks like my work here is done.
Send me home.

18:46.358 --> 18:50.162
Just kidding.
Please don't. Too soon.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.331
So, if you guys
want a specialty drink,

18:52.431 --> 18:54.933
my bestie came up with it.
The Confi-Diva.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.668
Can I just ask for it?
Will they know?

18:56.768 --> 18:58.504
Yeah. They know
the Confi-Diva.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.005
Confi-Diva.
Look at that.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.940
She's got a drink for you
and everything.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.675
Looking out for your girl
like that.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.444
That's a birthday for you
right there.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.479
I'm not really enjoying
this situation

19:07.546 --> 19:09.148
between my mom and Scott.

19:09.214 --> 19:13.218
I feel like Philip is probably
the one for my mom right now.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.988
He's very respectful,
and I really like that.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.790
I just want her
to kind of choose wisely.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.492
I think that the toast
is pretty obvious.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.861
The toast
to the Confi-Diva.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.464
- Yes.
- Confi-Diva!

19:25.531 --> 19:26.999
- Yes!
- Happy birthday.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.634
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.902
- Whoo!
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.738
- Love you.
- Aww. Yay.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.707
Yes!
Toast to Confi-Diva.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.476
When it's my mom's birthday,
we're usually,

19:37.543 --> 19:38.844
like, grilling out.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.812
We got the music up loud.
We got the tequila shots.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.548
So, yeah,
I'm definitely jealous,

19:42.648 --> 19:44.683
but I'm very blessed
that, you know,

19:44.750 --> 19:47.019
those people in the house
are with my mom.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.022
So, what do you have to say
for yourself tonight

19:50.088 --> 19:51.490
on your Confi-Diva birthday?

19:51.557 --> 19:54.993
I appreciate and love each
and every one of you.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.230
And this is just
the start of tonight

19:58.330 --> 20:02.701
of a whole new confident woman
called Confi-Diva.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.903
- A toast to the start.
- Yes!

20:05.003 --> 20:07.573
That is her.
It's not her alter ego.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.374
It's not her superhero alias.

20:09.441 --> 20:12.744
She really is a Confi-Diva.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.079
I'm toasting to everyone

20:14.179 --> 20:15.747
on drinking up and
letting their hair out.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.749
Like, hang loose.
Really.

20:17.849 --> 20:19.885
I wonder if the, like,
elimination tonight

20:19.952 --> 20:21.753
like, awakened things,
though.

20:21.853 --> 20:24.256
They were like, "We got to
get our shit together!"

20:24.356 --> 20:25.924
It's definitely
possible.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.560
- Ahh!
- Meddle Time!

20:28.627 --> 20:30.796
Meddle Time!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.931
Me. Cool.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.440
Or Option B...

20:45.577 --> 20:47.212
I want my mom
to have a connection

20:47.279 --> 20:50.048
and a relationship after this,
and the sacrifice was blowing up

20:50.115 --> 20:53.585
100 balloons for a little
one-on-one time.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.120
I'm gonna go with Option A.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.757
I'm gonna gift a sumptuous
chocolate fondue to my mama.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.659
I wonder what
"sumptuous" means.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.062
- Meddle activated!
- Meddle activated!

21:04.129 --> 21:07.132
This is awesome.
I am so excited. Let's go.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.501
There's Jimmy!
Ah, Jimmy!

21:11.903 --> 21:14.172
Ahh.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.309
- Hi.
- He looks so cute. Oh, my gosh.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.645
Why does Jimmy always seem
to show up just in time?

21:19.745 --> 21:20.846
Just in time.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.180
Stephanie,
this is for you.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.150
- Me?
- Ohh!

21:25.250 --> 21:28.287
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

21:28.353 --> 21:29.655
Jimmy:
And there's a card for you.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.658
A little fondue,
a little fon-don't.

21:32.758 --> 21:36.295
"Stephanie, enjoy a scrumptious
chocolate fondue

21:36.361 --> 21:39.498
with a man of your choice."

21:39.598 --> 21:43.335
Be careful how you choose,
honey, because...

21:43.435 --> 21:44.936
She gotta choose.

21:45.003 --> 21:48.307
I think I'm going to choose,
um, Philip.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.175
Wow. Okay. Man.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.110
Yeah.
Are you good with that?

21:52.177 --> 21:53.445
Am I good with that?

21:53.512 --> 21:56.615
You're with Metal Mama tonight.
Metal Mama!

21:56.682 --> 21:58.517
- Yeah!
- All right!

21:58.617 --> 22:00.886
I like the guy with the hammer.
That's good.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.190
- Whoa!

22:05.290 --> 22:08.660
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.496
Metal Mama,
get that in his mouth.

22:11.563 --> 22:15.033
- Ohh.
- Ohh!

22:15.133 --> 22:16.401
What the f--

22:16.501 --> 22:17.903
We can go back
to the dance floor.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.371
Trish:
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, come on.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.340
Really, Philip?
That's what we're gonna do?

22:21.406 --> 22:23.642
You're just -- You're j--
You're just gonna leave me?

22:23.709 --> 22:26.812
I'm a very strong individual,
but very sweet and loving.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.247
And so I think that sometimes
they get too intimidated,

22:29.348 --> 22:32.084
and it's a bit frustrating
for me.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.553
Just to me, the impression
I get of you is that you just --

22:34.653 --> 22:37.689
you do a great job of just
putting people at ease, as well.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.858
- Aww. Thank you!
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.893
I don't think this is gonna
change anything for my mother.

22:41.993 --> 22:45.030
She came in with a full, like,
pep in her step,

22:45.097 --> 22:48.066
ready, open,
like, really make a connection.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.569
I think she will, you know,
be very conscious

22:50.669 --> 22:53.672
of honing in on that person,
a.k.a. Philip.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.073
Karen:
This is so lovely.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.242
I would have something
like this in my house.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.378
- Yes.
- Like in an entryway, you know?

22:59.444 --> 23:01.713
They're holding hands. They're
definitely kissing tonight.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.049
Troy and Karen are definitely
kissing. It has to happen.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.551
I had some special
questions for you.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.553
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Mm-hmm.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.589
But I think I will wait.
I need to look at my notebook.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.557
I wrote them down.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.726
They're gradually leaning in,
it seems like. I don't know.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.928
Dude, are they
gonna kiss right now?

23:17.028 --> 23:18.296
I hope.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.931
Well, clearly, we're both
pretty comfortable.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.967
Mm-hmm.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.535
- Yes.
- Ohh!

23:23.602 --> 23:25.370
- It's a great first step.
- It was. It is.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.440
Cheers to you.

23:38.216 --> 23:39.451
I guess it's pretty cool.

23:39.551 --> 23:40.919
I think he thinks
it's cool, I think.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.621
He's falling in love,
is what he's doing.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.922
Look at them.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.891
I really, really,
really like your dad.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.893
I like them together.

23:47.959 --> 23:51.797
So, have you ever had
a long-distance relationship?

23:51.897 --> 23:53.231
That woman in Tennessee.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.133
He actually made
such an effort.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.803
He would go to Tennessee,
like, every other weekend.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.805
- How long was it?
- You know, kind of a while.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.606
You know, 'cause
we were friends a while

24:01.673 --> 24:03.809
before anything else
happened.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.677
I mean, clearly, that's
how things are gonna start

24:05.777 --> 24:08.280
for you and me
coming out of here.

24:08.346 --> 24:10.515
I'll get you down
to Florida eventually.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.751
Or, you know,
in two years, I can move.

24:12.818 --> 24:16.021
Okay, see, this is what
I like to see, though.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.456
This is what
we came here for.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.357
Like, start seeing someone
in a relationship.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.026
Yeah, it's really sweet.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.528
But I always said I would
only ever move up north

24:23.628 --> 24:26.932
for a compelling reason,
and you're pretty compelling.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.835
So don't think for one second
that this stops

24:29.935 --> 24:32.204
when we leave
because it doesn't.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.306
They both just talked
about, like,

24:34.372 --> 24:36.541
their futures
outside of this,

24:36.641 --> 24:39.177
and I think
that's really interesting.

24:39.277 --> 24:40.612
They're not in La La Land.

24:40.679 --> 24:43.315
Like, they're actually
talking about the future.

24:43.381 --> 24:46.685
Coming into this process,
I definitely wanted my mom

24:46.785 --> 24:50.522
to make a connection
that can be friendly

24:50.622 --> 24:53.191
and then see where that goes
outside of the retreat,

24:53.291 --> 24:56.561
not plan your marriage
and leave as a couple.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.963
That's weird.

24:58.029 --> 24:59.965
I'm really excited about
getting to know you better

25:00.031 --> 25:02.667
and continuing
to do that.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.169
- Meddle Time!
- Meddle Time!

25:04.236 --> 25:09.508
- Meddle Time!
- Meddle time! Yes!

25:09.574 --> 25:11.343
I love Meddle Time,
dude.

25:11.409 --> 25:13.411
I'm a little nervous,
though.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.547
- Destiny.
- You're getting all the things.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.182
- "Destiny."
- Damn.

25:17.249 --> 25:21.386
"Option A, serenade your mom
with a romantic live harpist

25:21.486 --> 25:25.590
at a VIP table
with a guest of her choosing."

25:25.690 --> 25:27.993
Or Option B...

25:34.399 --> 25:36.735
Low-key,
that'd be so funny.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.572
Actually, you know what?

25:40.672 --> 25:45.210
I want to go with Option...

25:45.277 --> 25:46.678
B.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.847
Only because I think
it'll be fun.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.415
I'm all for, like --
Let's say.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.918
I think she'll --
She knows how to work that.

25:53.018 --> 25:56.922
My mom's personality is really,
like, fun and outgoing,

25:57.022 --> 26:00.559
and I chose to have
an out-of-tune harpist

26:00.625 --> 26:03.795
to see how she would
react and roll with it.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.764
And I want all of
the other parents

26:05.864 --> 26:07.365
to see her sense of humor.

26:07.432 --> 26:10.101
- This is gonna be awesome.
- This is gonna be so funny.

26:10.201 --> 26:11.937
Meddle activated!

26:14.372 --> 26:15.440
So sorry to interrupt.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.609
- It's okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:17.709 --> 26:21.212
I've got an envelope,
bitches.

26:21.279 --> 26:25.083
"Kiki, please choose
one man to join you

26:25.150 --> 26:29.087
at a special VIP section
of the party."

26:29.154 --> 26:31.456
- Ooh!
- Whoa.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.593
I'm just gonna invite him.
Excuse me, y'all.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.962
Sorry, not sorry
to break this up.

26:37.062 --> 26:40.298
- No!
- No! Mom!

26:40.398 --> 26:41.566
Will you please join me?

26:41.633 --> 26:44.469
He very well may say no!
Mom!

26:44.569 --> 26:48.006
She is ballsy.

26:48.106 --> 26:48.974
Hey!

26:49.074 --> 26:51.142
Hey. Enjoy. Enjoy.

26:51.242 --> 26:53.111
Oh, man.

26:53.178 --> 26:55.180
Holy shit!

26:55.280 --> 26:56.481
Enjoy.

26:56.581 --> 26:57.983
We'll have to continue it
at some point.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.584
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.859
She's just eating fondue
by herself now.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.495
It was definitely
a bold move on my mom's part.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.931
There was, like, this Kumbaya
family type of thing,

27:12.998 --> 27:15.166
so I know it, like,
was like, "Whoa.

27:15.266 --> 27:18.169
I can't believe she did that,
like, interrupted the date

27:18.269 --> 27:19.537
and all of that stuff."

27:19.638 --> 27:21.272
But I don't apologize
for my mama.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.308
She grown, and she gonna do
what she gonna do.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.478
Sorry your mom's date
got cut short.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.213
Yeah, me too.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.681
Whoa. Look at th-- What?

27:29.781 --> 27:32.050
Look at this. What?
Oh, my goodness.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.352
You shouldn't have, but
of course you should have.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.356
Hmm.

27:38.456 --> 27:39.691
I'm gonna sit here.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.159
Oh, this is bad.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.230
Wow. That's beautiful.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.898
This is beautiful.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.468
Can you believe this?

27:50.535 --> 27:53.338
No, for real,
this is quite --

27:57.809 --> 27:59.744
Can I invite you
to -- for a --

27:59.844 --> 28:01.513
Can we, like,
do a little dance to the --

28:01.579 --> 28:03.682
- Dance?
- Yeah, let's do that.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.383
Dance?

28:11.256 --> 28:12.590
Oh!

28:12.691 --> 28:14.759
That was a heck of a note.
That was a heck of a note.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.928
- They don't even notice.
- Oh, my God!

28:18.563 --> 28:19.898
It sounds beautiful.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.766
- "It sounds beautiful."
- No way.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.735
Your mom, dude.
I love your mom so much.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.403
I fucking love your mom
so much.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.072
"It sounds beautiful."

28:27.172 --> 28:29.207
It sounds
so mysterious, right?

28:32.877 --> 28:35.046
I'm trying to
understand the melody.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.115
There -- It isn't any.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.920
This is bad.
This is really bad.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.755
This is -- This is terrible.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.257
Noah:
Shit sounds fire, yo.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.796
Whoo.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.865
Thank you.
That was sweet.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.701
- At least they're clapping.
- Yeah.

28:56.768 --> 29:00.405
So, I'm gonna do something
I don't normally do.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.374
I think you're a handsome
gentleman, right?

29:03.441 --> 29:05.243
I feel like
there's a connection.

29:05.310 --> 29:09.047
I really enjoy your energy
and your spirit and your heart.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.416
I mean, you are
not bad to look at.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.787
Um, and I'd like to be able
to continue to develop

29:15.887 --> 29:17.455
and connect with you more.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.091
And I'd like to know if there's
an interest in doing that.

29:20.158 --> 29:23.394
She had to very...
follow up.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.463
No, 'cause sometimes
you're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,"

29:25.563 --> 29:28.633
but you don't really know
until you explicitly ask.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.169
Um...

29:31.269 --> 29:34.806
So, in just talking to you,

29:34.906 --> 29:36.941
because we had
the day before and now,

29:37.008 --> 29:38.810
you know,
we're talking now,

29:38.910 --> 29:41.479
I feel like we need to get
to know each other more.

29:41.579 --> 29:44.449
You know,
I feel like there's --

29:44.516 --> 29:48.086
Um, I know very little
about your background

29:48.153 --> 29:50.488
and a little
about who you are.

29:50.588 --> 29:52.023
When I asked you before,

29:52.123 --> 29:53.992
you know,
just a few things about,

29:54.092 --> 29:56.027
"Oh, just tell me
what happened," you know,

29:56.127 --> 29:59.197
the marriage maybe,
you know, or with...

29:59.297 --> 30:02.133
And you said, you know, you're
trying to forget about the past

30:02.200 --> 30:04.102
and you're trying to go
forward with the future.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.838
My thinking on that
is it's important

30:06.938 --> 30:10.341
to -- to look at the past,
learn from it,

30:10.441 --> 30:14.946
and then know you're moving
forward and improving on that,

30:15.013 --> 30:17.015
and then, you know,
where you want to be.

30:17.115 --> 30:20.218
I felt like, how in the world
can we get to know each other

30:20.318 --> 30:23.688
and connect if we're looking
at our past saying,

30:23.788 --> 30:26.524
"Well, let's just let
the past be the past"?

30:26.624 --> 30:29.527
When I heard that,
my attitude was, you know --

30:29.627 --> 30:31.696
I'm not -- I don't
really want to deal

30:31.796 --> 30:34.833
with somebody who hasn't
dealt with their past.

30:37.702 --> 30:41.206
After his divorce, I think that
definitely left a very, like --

30:41.306 --> 30:43.208
left a scar a little bit.

30:43.308 --> 30:44.976
A scar?
It sounded like it.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.345
He doesn't want to go through
with something like that again.

30:47.412 --> 30:48.880
You know, it was, uh --

30:48.980 --> 30:50.215
It was really,
like, really rough.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.883
And he doesn't talk
about it very much.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.852
This is actually the first time
I'm hearing about it,

30:53.918 --> 30:57.055
to be honest,
so this is interesting.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.857
- Is she okay?
- I think she's --

30:58.923 --> 31:02.227
I honestly believe
she's like, "Oh."

31:02.327 --> 31:05.196
Or maybe she may take it
as an opportunity to, you know,

31:05.263 --> 31:06.865
talk to someone else,
which is --

31:06.931 --> 31:10.235
Everyone's, like,
should be doing.

31:13.605 --> 31:14.906
Hi, Jimmy!
Hi, handsome.

31:15.006 --> 31:17.108
We have a little birthday
surprise for you,

31:17.208 --> 31:19.410
so if you want to come
into the living room.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.612
Okay.
I'm not mad.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.046
Oh, birthday surprise
for Trish.

31:22.113 --> 31:23.748
You go over there,
and I'll go in the corner.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.016
How about that?

31:25.083 --> 31:27.518
The birthday
that never ends.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.687
Miss Confidence needs
to get on the pole!

31:29.754 --> 31:31.756
Oh, Lord.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.592
I need to stay on the ground.

31:34.692 --> 31:36.761
She said, "Oh, God, no."

31:36.861 --> 31:39.130
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

31:39.230 --> 31:42.100
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna cry for you!

31:42.200 --> 31:44.202
<i>Happy birthday, Mama.</i>
<i>I love you so much.</i>

31:44.269 --> 31:46.271
<i>You are the baddest bitch.</i>

31:46.371 --> 31:48.239
<i>And I hope you're having</i>
<i>an amazing day.</i>

31:48.306 --> 31:50.808
<i>I want you to know I hope</i>
<i>you are in that house</i>

31:50.909 --> 31:53.611
<i>finding your man,</i>
<i>my future stepdad.</i>

31:53.711 --> 31:55.113
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.749
<i>But it's time for you</i>
<i>to show who you want,</i>

31:57.815 --> 31:59.918
<i>and I hope you're doing that,</i>
<i>and do not forget</i>

31:59.984 --> 32:02.787
<i>you are so beautiful</i>
<i>and you're such an amazing mom.</i>

32:02.887 --> 32:04.489
<i>And I hope you are showing that</i>

32:04.589 --> 32:06.491
<i>to the person</i>
<i>you might be liking.</i>

32:06.591 --> 32:08.259
Whoo!

32:09.994 --> 32:11.462
Good job, Whitney.

32:11.562 --> 32:14.465
- That girl! She's gorgeous!
- I told y'all. I told y'all.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.134
That's Whitney.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.903
Look at that confident girl.
Oh, my goodness.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.338
You should be so proud.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.340
Aww.
I'm just glad she's happy.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.175
I see all the genes
in there, man,

32:24.275 --> 32:25.843
all the lovely,
beautiful genes.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.613
You see how she came out,
though? Like, she's like --

32:28.680 --> 32:30.648
She said,
"You a badass."

32:30.748 --> 32:32.483
Period. Period.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.952
She put me in my place.

32:34.018 --> 32:38.189
Like, "Mom, overcome your fears.
Get the man.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.358
Go get him and bring me
home a stepdaddy."

32:40.458 --> 32:43.861
I just -- She made me cry
and laugh at the same time.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.631
Something has changed
in my Whitney

32:46.698 --> 32:48.533
during this process, too,

32:48.633 --> 32:51.669
'cause knowing she knew
she was gonna have to do that

32:51.769 --> 32:53.037
and we were all gonna see it,

32:53.137 --> 32:57.041
and she still said that
like a strong woman.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.876
So something
is going on over there

32:58.977 --> 33:01.279
that's changing her, as well.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.648
I am so proud of Whitney.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.884
I can see just in that little
time how much she has changed.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.953
- Yay, Whitney.
- Yay, Whitney.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.688
- Yay, Whitney.
- Yay, Whitney. Yay, Whitney.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.623
To Whitney.
To the rest of the kids.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.559
Rest of the kids.
To all the kids.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.377
Whoo-hoo!

33:32.477 --> 33:35.880
Hey, everybody! Hey!
Hello.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.082
Hey. Wow.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.218
Oh, my God!

33:40.318 --> 33:42.720
Get that, girl.
That's your birthday present.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.490
Oh, my God. They got my mom
a freakin' stripper.

33:45.556 --> 33:46.991
I'm Grant.
How are you doing?

33:47.058 --> 33:49.594
Jimmy:
And he lives here now.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.163
Uh, it is not a stripper.
It is a dad.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.899
- How's everybody doing?
- Hi!

33:54.999 --> 33:57.835
Oh, this is amazing.
This is the best birthday ever.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.905
Carlie:
Hello, everybody!

34:01.005 --> 34:03.775
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm Carlie.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.511
- Carlie, PJ.
- Oh, my God! Hello!

34:06.577 --> 34:07.912
Nice to meet you.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.414
I'm Carlie. I'm 22.

34:09.514 --> 34:12.050
And I've nominated my dad
for Second Chance Retreat.

34:12.116 --> 34:13.184
- I'm Carlie.
- Carlie.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.585
Nice to meet you.
I'm Noah.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.587
Raising three kids alone
for the last 11 years

34:16.687 --> 34:18.389
has been very challenging
because I've been sort of

34:18.456 --> 34:20.425
waiting for my youngest
to graduate from high school

34:20.525 --> 34:22.560
to get back to some things
that I couldn't do.

34:22.627 --> 34:26.264
My dad's dating life
has been Sahara Desert dry,

34:26.364 --> 34:28.433
nonexistent,
but that's okay.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.035
That's why
he's been nominated.

34:31.102 --> 34:32.537
- How<i> you</i> doing?
- Doing great.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.306
I get to jump out of a cake.
It's awesome.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.109
Welcome to the family!

34:38.209 --> 34:39.477
Go get him, girl.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.245
Trish said,
"Let me go get my cake."

34:41.312 --> 34:43.247
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

34:43.314 --> 34:46.317
- Good.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.718
- Wow. Grant.
- I'm Troy.

34:47.785 --> 34:49.954
- Troy, nice to meet you.
- Welcome to the house.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.722
- Karen.
- Karen. Nice to meet you.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.458
Yes, we do hugs.
Of course we do.

34:53.558 --> 34:54.659
Take a seat.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.428
I'm guessing your dad
just popped out of a cake.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.831
- What?
- Is that your father?

34:59.931 --> 35:01.265
I guess that's my dad.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.835
I notice all of the monitors.
What is going on?

35:03.935 --> 35:06.637
I can see my actual dad
on the screen.

35:06.737 --> 35:08.739
- Kiki. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Grant. Nice to meet you.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.141
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.244
Grant came in.
We caught eyes with one another.

35:13.311 --> 35:16.247
So, to me,
that was a sign of interest.

35:16.314 --> 35:19.150
Oh, your dad's
so handsome!

35:19.250 --> 35:20.952
- Aww. Thank you.
- So handsome!

35:21.018 --> 35:23.588
I would assume that is
your mom's perfect match,

35:23.654 --> 35:27.358
the way they just
presented him like a gift.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.527
- Yeah, so, welcome, man.
- Yeah.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.762
Where are you
joining us from?

35:31.829 --> 35:33.931
- I'm from Dallas, Texas.
- Dallas. Okay.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.167
Actually a little north.
McKinney, Texas.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.002
About 30 miles north.

35:38.102 --> 35:39.437
Trish:
Okay. Another man?

35:39.504 --> 35:42.440
Hey, hey.
I got another man to play.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.176
Yes, and who brought you here
to Second Chance Retreat?

35:45.276 --> 35:47.512
- My daughter Carlie.
- Your daughter Carlie. Okay.

35:47.612 --> 35:50.882
She's 22. I'm so excited to
meet you guys. This is awesome.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.950
- Let's go for the drink.
- Come on, you guys.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.319
I love that the bar
is the first thing you show me.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.355
That's awesome. It's like,
"Take him to the bar."

35:57.455 --> 36:00.191
What is your dad like?
How long's he been single for?

36:00.291 --> 36:03.194
My dad, so, he got divorced
like 10 years ago,

36:03.294 --> 36:05.396
and he's only been
in one relationship since then.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.632
- Oh, wow.
- And it was like -- I know.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.133
Like, he's got to
get out there.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.902
But, like, she was
a really great lady,

36:11.002 --> 36:12.737
and I honestly
don't know what happened.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.839
Was it a long relationship
or like...?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.541
Yeah, it was a few years.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.342
So, like, he's really
a one-woman guy,

36:18.409 --> 36:20.378
like, really takes
his time with things.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.480
He's honestly
the sweetest person I know

36:22.547 --> 36:23.748
and just really goofy.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.883
Yeah, I worked for
boxing promoter Don King,

36:25.983 --> 36:27.351
so I was in
the boxing business.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.720
Oh, we know Don King.
Cool.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.723
Grant is Trish's
birthday gift, right?

36:32.823 --> 36:34.992
From the Midwest to the world
of professional boxing

36:35.059 --> 36:37.328
was kind of a shock.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.264
In my mind, it's like, "Well,
that's<i> her</i> birthday gift."

36:40.364 --> 36:43.568
You don't take people's
birthday presents from them.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.869
That's rude.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.572
But everyone is fair game.

36:47.672 --> 36:49.073
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.608
Thank you so much.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.743
- What's your dad's type?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.845
I wouldn't say he has,
like, one specific type.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.847
He really just likes women
who like to go out

36:56.914 --> 37:00.718
and, like, go on hikes or, like,
just go try new -- active women.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.253
Yes.
That's the word.

37:02.353 --> 37:05.389
Those are some
superhero moves.

37:05.456 --> 37:08.359
Man, that's pretty impressive
in those work boots.

37:08.426 --> 37:12.430
Destiny's mom is Kiki,
and she's in the cheetah print.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.764
See her on the bottom.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.533
She's talking
to your dad right now.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.867
Ooh!

37:16.934 --> 37:18.202
You were raising
your children alone?

37:18.269 --> 37:20.104
- Yes.
- As a single mom, I hear you.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.773
I got divorced
about 11 years ago.

37:22.873 --> 37:24.542
Where are you from?

37:24.609 --> 37:26.110
Okay.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.212
Yeah, and where's that?
No, I'm just joking.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.650
Kids?

37:32.750 --> 37:33.918
Three. Three daughters.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.987
We both have three.
What are their ages?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.789
29, 26, and 15.

37:38.889 --> 37:41.292
All right.
Good spacing there, right?

37:41.392 --> 37:43.661
Well, I mean,
the 15- and 26-year-old,

37:43.761 --> 37:45.630
I'm not really sure
about that.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.832
Everyone is on their way
out of the house for you, right?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.467
'Cause you just said
your youngest is 18.

37:49.567 --> 37:51.469
Yes, they just graduated
high school.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.304
The next six months is gonna be,
like, total freedom.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.505
- That's cool.
- So it's gonna be awesome.

37:54.605 --> 37:55.906
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I like that.

37:55.973 --> 37:58.242
Yeah, it's gonna be
really cool. Listen to me.

37:58.309 --> 38:01.312
I'm like, "Yeah, it's really
cool. My kids are leaving.
It's awesome."

38:01.412 --> 38:02.680
Yeah. Listen.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.582
As a single parent,
when you put in that time,

38:04.649 --> 38:07.652
I think it's okay to say, like,
"It's me time.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.353
It's go time
for me, yeah."

38:09.453 --> 38:12.256
Grant and my mom, they
have a lot in common, actually.

38:12.323 --> 38:15.760
He's, like, a creative person,
and so is my mom.

38:15.826 --> 38:17.261
You know, she's been, you know,

38:17.328 --> 38:19.130
dibblin', dabbilin'
with Phillip,

38:19.196 --> 38:21.165
but I could see something there.

38:21.265 --> 38:22.767
Well, I'm glad that
you're here. Welcome.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.835
Yes, yes.
So nice to meet you, too.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.304
Nice to meet you, as well.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.939
- Now, it's Kiki?
- Kiki, yeah, yeah.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.808
- Just K-I-K-I?
- You got -- Come on, now.

38:30.875 --> 38:32.977
It's easy. It's easy.
That's an easy one.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.679
- Wanna do a photo?
- Yes, let's do it.

38:34.779 --> 38:38.516
He has a very entertaining
energy about him,

38:38.616 --> 38:42.820
so I am excited
to really get to know Grant.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.322
We really
have to get in close.

38:44.388 --> 38:46.891
There's nothing wrong
with close.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.993
I guess we got to
push the button.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.294
Oh, yeah.
That would --

38:50.361 --> 38:51.996
- That would help.
- That would help.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.170
You're good. Yeah.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.543
Tappin' that ass already.
You just got here.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.211
Yeah, it's comfortable.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.083
- Oops.
- Oops!

39:14.652 --> 39:16.220
You're so beautiful.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.855
Thank you.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.056
You make me happy.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.392
I make you happy?
Already?

39:21.492 --> 39:22.993
Yep. Uh, yeah.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.563
Like, from the day I walked
in here, you've made me happy.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.898
Well, from the moment
I saw you, you know?

39:27.998 --> 39:29.734
I knew you were
super beautiful.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.236
And then the moment
I heard you,

39:32.336 --> 39:36.574
I knew you were everything else
I was looking for.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.376
Oh, shit.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.077
Ugh.

39:40.177 --> 39:43.714
Super sweet, super kind,
super genuine.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.085
Okay. You can stop now.
So many compliments.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.020
And, just, you know...

39:50.087 --> 39:52.690
You don't take
compliments well?

39:52.757 --> 39:57.461
I feel so bad because Scott
is always giving me compliments,

39:57.561 --> 40:02.199
and I haven't completely
opened myself up.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.934
The whole relationship thing.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.604
Just because I haven't been in
this space in such a long time,

40:06.704 --> 40:11.142
it is very scary because
I don't want to be hurt<i> again.</i>

40:11.242 --> 40:13.944
I'll stop being goofy.
I'll try to anyways.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.079
You can't.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.114
Yeah, that's true, too.

40:17.214 --> 40:19.650
See how well that
you know me already?

40:21.285 --> 40:23.320
All right.
Let's see if we can...

40:23.421 --> 40:26.157
- Can we fit?
- Of course we can.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.298
Okay. You gonna
kiss me on my cheek?

40:39.336 --> 40:41.305
What else?
Selfie pose?

40:41.405 --> 40:43.274
- Uh...
- How's that?

40:45.976 --> 40:47.678
Funny face.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.513
I can't help smiling.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.751
There's nothing funny.
I'm just smiling.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.854
Scott makes me feel
so comfortable.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.789
He's like
an unexpected blessing,

40:58.856 --> 41:00.291
like a breath of fresh air.

41:00.357 --> 41:03.494
I can see myself
falling in love with Scott.

41:03.594 --> 41:07.998
Shit. Ugh.
I hate this shit.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.434
Are you okay?

41:10.501 --> 41:13.003
- Nah.
- What's up?

41:13.103 --> 41:16.173
I don't like
Scott with my mom.

41:16.273 --> 41:18.175
Kiss me on my lips?

41:24.215 --> 41:27.351
I just feel -- Three weeks is
not enough time to find love.

41:27.451 --> 41:30.287
Because, like, long distance,
plus like...

41:30.354 --> 41:33.324
And distance
is a whole --

41:33.390 --> 41:36.961
You're fucking changing
your whole life.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.697
Like, you're moving to a whole
nother state for someone?

41:39.797 --> 41:41.866
And not even that.
You're gonna fucking fly

41:41.966 --> 41:43.634
every other weekend
back and forth.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.836
That's what I'm saying.
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.072
It is tough for me
to just see them

41:48.172 --> 41:50.875
knowing Scott is not
the best for my mother.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.711
Scott can't rush relationships
with my mom.

41:53.811 --> 41:55.546
That's a problem for me.

41:55.646 --> 41:56.914
I don't like it.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.416
Oh, wait.
We get photos outside.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.719
I didn't think we were actually
gonna get the photos.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.554
Oh, maybe on the outside
of the booth.

42:03.654 --> 42:04.889
Okay.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.657
We can't show anybody
the evidence.

42:06.724 --> 42:09.860
By the end of this journey,
I have to get in the way

42:09.927 --> 42:11.729
of my mom's relationship.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.531
It just can't happen.
