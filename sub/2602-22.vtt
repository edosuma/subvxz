WEBVTT

00:03.434 --> 00:06.887
I didn't wash my hands,
and I don't care.

00:06.888 --> 00:08.653
Yup.

00:08.654 --> 00:12.634
Cool to be some place
right when things get good, right?

00:13.961 --> 00:17.532
Another pitcher of
your strongest beer, please, good sir,

00:17.533 --> 00:20.224
and a glass thingie
to drink it out of.

00:20.225 --> 00:24.546
And one of whatever
this guy's having for that guy,

00:24.547 --> 00:27.069
and one of what
that guy's having for this guy.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.818
And another round for everyone, on me!

00:30.987 --> 00:32.720
That's right.
That's right.

00:32.722 --> 00:34.823
- Thanks, buddy.
- What's the occasion?

00:34.858 --> 00:36.759
Oh, I'm celebrating.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.963
My name's Jake Peralta,
and I just got fired from the NYPD.

01:03.887 --> 01:05.187
All right, listen up.

01:05.188 --> 01:06.789
What you're about to see
is highly disturbing,

01:06.790 --> 01:08.190
but please, no comments.

01:08.191 --> 01:11.493
This man is in pain,
so above all else, be kind.

01:14.782 --> 01:16.865
Good morning, Boyle.

01:16.866 --> 01:18.500
Let's just get it out there.

01:18.501 --> 01:20.269
Vivian broke up with me last night.

01:20.303 --> 01:23.405
I'm sorry, chucklebunny.

01:23.406 --> 01:24.807
Charles, wait!

01:24.808 --> 01:26.241
Yes?

01:26.242 --> 01:28.844
Your food dehydrator.

01:28.845 --> 01:30.546
Oh, God.

01:30.547 --> 01:31.914
It's official.

01:31.948 --> 01:35.617
The wedding's off, and
this is what I'm like now.

01:35.618 --> 01:37.519
- Life is a pit.
<i>-  Excuse me?</i>

01:37.554 --> 01:39.488
I don't understand.
Did you already have

01:39.489 --> 01:41.790
a matrix getup at
home for some reason?

01:41.825 --> 01:43.892
No, Gina, I bought this with the money

01:43.893 --> 01:46.528
I was going to spend on
our honeymoon to cape canaveral.

01:46.563 --> 01:47.896
I'm so sorry, buddy.

01:47.897 --> 01:52.201
Don't be, I'm settling
into the darkness nicely.

01:52.202 --> 01:54.903
I definitely get you now.

01:54.904 --> 01:56.205
What you got there, Boyle?

01:56.206 --> 01:57.773
Eggs in a bag.

01:57.774 --> 02:00.442
Nothing brings me
joy anymore, not even food.

02:00.443 --> 02:02.044
Now, I only eat for sustenance.

02:05.215 --> 02:07.383
Smart.
Save that for later.

02:07.835 --> 02:08.984
Peralta?

02:08.985 --> 02:13.355
My office, now.

02:13.356 --> 02:14.957
Sir?

02:14.958 --> 02:17.459
Ah.
Commissioner Podolski.

02:17.494 --> 02:19.261
It's been a while.
Maybe because you haven't

02:19.262 --> 02:21.997
put any of my children
in handcuffs recently.

02:21.998 --> 02:23.932
Yay, enemies for life.

02:23.933 --> 02:25.813
Peralta, have you been
investigating Lucas Wint?

02:25.978 --> 02:26.969
Uh, yeah, I have.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.771
I think he's laundering money
for drug dealers.

02:28.772 --> 02:31.940
Don't be an idiot.
Lucas Wint is a civic leader.

02:31.941 --> 02:33.742
He runs a major charity,

02:33.777 --> 02:36.812
his community center is the
lifeblood of that neighborhood,

02:36.846 --> 02:40.649
and he officially claims
you have been harassing him.

02:40.650 --> 02:43.385
What?
That's insane.

02:43.386 --> 02:44.486
I've been trying to talk to him,

02:44.487 --> 02:46.922
and he keeps avoiding me
like a guilty person,

02:46.923 --> 02:50.859
so I approached him
at his weekly basketball game.

02:50.860 --> 02:52.861
Hey there, Wint, I got
a couple questions for you.

02:52.862 --> 02:54.063
I told you to back off.

02:54.064 --> 02:55.631
This is completely inappropriate.

02:55.632 --> 02:59.268
No, this is me scoring in your face!

02:59.269 --> 03:00.569
Kobe!

03:00.570 --> 03:03.706
Seemed like an obvious goal-tend,
but that's besides the point.

03:03.707 --> 03:06.542
Peralta, do you have any evidence
to support your suspicions?

03:06.543 --> 03:08.644
There's a lot of chatter
amongst low-level drug dealers.

03:08.678 --> 03:09.981
Chatter?
Sorry, I know.

03:10.147 --> 03:11.447
I hate that word too.

03:11.448 --> 03:12.448
Tittle-tattle.

03:12.449 --> 03:14.416
Just stay away from Wint.

03:14.417 --> 03:15.951
That's an order.

03:15.952 --> 03:18.887
Captain, I'm telling you
this is reliable tittle-tattle.

03:18.888 --> 03:19.989
You have to trust me.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.190
Trust me.

03:21.191 --> 03:23.359
It's in your best
interest to back off.

03:23.393 --> 03:24.693
Fine.

03:24.694 --> 03:26.428
But just for the record,
I think you're both wrong.

03:26.429 --> 03:29.431
Self dismissed.

03:29.432 --> 03:31.600
We have to help Charles.
He's devastated.

03:31.601 --> 03:33.035
<i>I hate seeing him like this.</i>

03:33.036 --> 03:35.671
Breakups are cartoony, thumbs down.

03:35.672 --> 03:38.407
They make people feel
face-with-xs-for-the-eyes.

03:38.408 --> 03:40.009
What does that even mean?

03:40.043 --> 03:42.244
The english language
cannot fully capture

03:42.245 --> 03:44.146
the depth and complexity
of my thoughts,

03:44.180 --> 03:48.417
so I'm incorporating emoji into my
speech to better express myself.

03:48.418 --> 03:50.019
Winky face.
Oh, lord.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.453
Listen, this is simple.

03:51.454 --> 03:53.789
Boyle needs a little rebound nooky.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.324
Eggplant emoji.

03:55.325 --> 03:56.825
Rosa, you wanna get on that?

03:56.826 --> 03:58.827
Don't make me rip your tongue off.

03:58.828 --> 04:01.230
I would talk to him, but
I don't think I have any advice.

04:01.231 --> 04:03.532
All of my breakups
have been completely mutual.

04:03.566 --> 04:06.535
This is the best possible
option for both of us.

04:06.569 --> 04:10.005
Agreed.
Take care.

04:10.006 --> 04:12.794
That was the end
of an eight-year relationship.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.077
You know, I haven't had
that many romantic breakups,

04:15.078 --> 04:17.313
but neither of my children
will speak to me anymore.

04:17.314 --> 04:19.248
All right.
None of you are any help.

04:19.249 --> 04:21.617
Sarge and I will cheer up Charles.

04:21.651 --> 04:23.485
Oh.

04:23.486 --> 04:25.387
He's not even chewing them anymore.

04:25.388 --> 04:26.889
Ugh.

04:26.890 --> 04:29.124
Listen to this text
Boyle just sent me.

04:29.125 --> 04:33.362
"I finally know what used napkins at
a barbecue restaurant feel like."

04:33.363 --> 04:35.230
I hate breakups.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.735
I hope I never go through one again.

04:36.766 --> 04:38.100
Really?

04:38.101 --> 04:39.501
You think you'll spend the rest
of your life with Teddy?

04:39.536 --> 04:41.704
What?
No.

04:41.705 --> 04:43.372
Maybe.
I don't know.

04:43.373 --> 04:45.541
Just saying getting
dumped is a nightmare.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.242
No arguments here.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.744
I remember my worst breakup.

04:48.745 --> 04:51.249
Eighth grade.
Jenny Gildenhorn.

04:51.281 --> 04:53.048
Hey, Jenny.

04:53.049 --> 04:55.284
Jake, I don't wanna go out anymore.

04:55.285 --> 04:56.452
I like Eddie Fung now.

04:56.453 --> 04:58.187
But it's my bar Mitzvah.

04:58.188 --> 05:00.675
We were gonna grind.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.891
That day, I truly became a man.

05:02.892 --> 05:04.393
Wonder where Eddie Fung is now.

05:04.394 --> 05:06.061
867 Clinton street, apartment 2A.

05:06.062 --> 05:07.997
I know exactly where that bastard is.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.132
Get down, it's Wint!

05:10.133 --> 05:12.034
Wha... Wint?
Holt told you to drop that.

05:12.035 --> 05:13.369
I thought we were working a burglary.

05:13.403 --> 05:15.440
I know, I lied.
Apology? Apology accepted.

05:15.939 --> 05:18.073
Look, Podolski is wrong.
Wint is guilty.

05:18.074 --> 05:20.576
Yesterday, I saw him get into a
car with a known drug dealer.

05:20.577 --> 05:23.112
I didn't have time to take a
picture, but today, I came prepared.

05:23.113 --> 05:24.280
Did you tell Holt what you saw?

05:24.281 --> 05:25.781
No, I don't trust him on this.

05:25.782 --> 05:27.049
How can you not trust Holt?

05:27.050 --> 05:28.284
He's the executor of my will.

05:28.318 --> 05:29.952
Wint has crazy ties to city hall.

05:29.953 --> 05:32.588
I just don't think Holt would
risk giving up his command.

05:32.589 --> 05:34.223
Anyway.

05:34.224 --> 05:36.325
Oh, crap.
Where'd he go?

05:37.460 --> 05:39.795
Hello, Detective Peralta.

05:39.796 --> 05:41.330
Amy.

05:41.331 --> 05:43.165
Tell me who's there.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.967
I'm blind.

05:44.968 --> 05:48.237
You disobeyed my direct orders
to drop this case.

05:48.238 --> 05:49.471
I staked out Wint 'cause I got a tip

05:49.472 --> 05:50.973
he was meeting up with a drug dealer.

05:50.974 --> 05:52.308
And why didn't you tell me about this?

05:52.309 --> 05:54.143
Because you told me to drop the case.

05:54.144 --> 05:56.812
Look, let's just agree to say "I'm
sorry" on the count of three.

05:56.813 --> 05:59.682
One, two, three.

05:59.683 --> 06:01.550
See? Now, I'm just
disappointed in both of us.

06:01.551 --> 06:03.519
This is unacceptable,
and you've crossed the line.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.721
Sir, I am Amy Santiago,
and I have something to say.

06:05.722 --> 06:07.590
I think you're wrong.

06:07.591 --> 06:09.491
I think Detective Peralta
is onto something,

06:09.526 --> 06:11.160
and you should let him pursue it.

06:11.161 --> 06:13.028
I'm Amy Santiago,
and I'm done talking.

06:13.029 --> 06:15.598
Good, because this is
none of your concern.

06:15.599 --> 06:18.500
Commissioner Podolski is bringing
you up on charges and specs.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.436
You're facing a six-month suspension,

06:20.437 --> 06:22.304
and you're on administrative
leave until the hearing.

06:22.305 --> 06:24.173
Now, get out of my office.

06:24.174 --> 06:26.542
Fine.

06:26.543 --> 06:28.110
Here's my gun and my badge.

06:28.111 --> 06:30.346
I don't need those.
You're not suspended yet.

06:30.347 --> 06:31.914
You're on administrative leave.

06:31.948 --> 06:33.749
You never let me do anything cool.

06:35.882 --> 06:37.917
Ah.
Good morning, Captain.

06:37.918 --> 06:40.819
I got you your favorite breakfast,
a plain bagel and a water.

06:40.854 --> 06:42.922
Don't try to soften me up.

06:42.923 --> 06:44.256
Why'd you ask me
to meet you in this alley

06:44.257 --> 06:45.724
in Bensonhurst at 9:00 in the morning?

06:45.725 --> 06:47.426
Look, my best chance
of not getting suspended

06:47.427 --> 06:48.861
is proving that Wint is guilty.

06:48.862 --> 06:50.930
I got a confidential
informant I need you to meet.

06:50.964 --> 06:53.732
You continue to work this case
against my direct orders?

06:53.733 --> 06:55.401
You astound me.

06:55.435 --> 06:56.468
Thank you, sir.

06:56.469 --> 06:58.404
You astound me as well.

06:58.405 --> 07:00.472
But I didn't find him.

07:00.473 --> 07:02.474
Santiago did.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.843
What is going on with you?

07:04.878 --> 07:06.245
I don't know, sir.

07:06.246 --> 07:07.980
We're both off-roading it here.

07:07.981 --> 07:10.649
My internal GPS has been
recalculating for a week.

07:10.684 --> 07:12.051
This is Isaac.

07:12.052 --> 07:13.853
He used to be a pusher
for the bay Ridge boys.

07:13.887 --> 07:15.788
Dude, drugs don't need pushing.

07:15.789 --> 07:18.090
They push themselves.
People love drugs.

07:18.124 --> 07:19.425
Tell him about the donations.

07:19.426 --> 07:21.293
All right, look,
every friday, I put cash

07:21.294 --> 07:23.762
into a duffel bag and bring it
to Wint community center,

07:23.797 --> 07:25.764
room 265, and they mark it down

07:25.765 --> 07:28.067
as a charitable donation
in their account book.

07:28.068 --> 07:31.103
Ergo, laundering.

07:31.104 --> 07:32.304
So why should we believe you?

07:32.305 --> 07:33.272
I don't care who you believe.

07:33.306 --> 07:34.506
Just know I hate those dudes now.

07:34.507 --> 07:36.709
They carved up my territory so
bad, I had to quit selling drugs,

07:36.710 --> 07:38.143
and I love selling drugs.

07:38.178 --> 07:39.278
It was my dream job.

07:39.312 --> 07:40.646
Sir, I filled out a warrant request

07:40.647 --> 07:42.781
to search the community center
for the account book.

07:42.782 --> 07:45.484
I need you to sign it
before I can take it to a judge.

07:45.485 --> 07:49.788
I know I'm asking you to stick your
neck out, but please trust me.

07:49.789 --> 07:51.190
Fine.

07:51.191 --> 07:54.260
But I'll be with you
every step of the way.

07:54.261 --> 07:55.928
You know, you should just
put a microchip in his neck

07:55.929 --> 07:56.929
like a little doggy.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.230
All right, Isaac, thank you.

07:58.231 --> 07:59.899
Yeah, you're done.

07:59.900 --> 08:00.933
All right, guys.

08:00.934 --> 08:02.668
We have Peralta's hearing at 4:00.

08:02.669 --> 08:03.969
Anybody seen Boyle?

08:03.970 --> 08:05.571
Present.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.373
He seems even worse than before.

08:07.407 --> 08:10.042
I lost Vivian,
and now I might lose Jake.

08:10.076 --> 08:11.076
I don't know what else to do.

08:11.077 --> 08:12.311
I've tried being supportive.

08:12.312 --> 08:16.415
I listened to him talk about
Vivian's lips for over two hours.

08:16.416 --> 08:17.917
He kept describing them as "ample."

08:17.951 --> 08:20.386
So ample.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.388
Rosa.

08:22.422 --> 08:25.624
Have you ever been dumped?

08:25.659 --> 08:27.026
No.

08:27.027 --> 08:28.627
In all my breakups,
I'm always the dumper.

08:28.662 --> 08:31.597
I know you're having a hard time,
but I think I can fix this.

08:31.598 --> 08:35.634
There's this thing that I
do whenever I... Feel.

08:35.669 --> 08:36.669
What?

08:36.703 --> 08:41.573
Burn everything.

08:43.076 --> 08:46.512
Okay.
This feels right.

08:46.513 --> 08:48.447
No, it's terrible!
Vivian, I won't let you burn!

08:48.448 --> 08:50.649
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ow!

08:50.650 --> 08:52.017
Ah!
Ooh!

08:52.018 --> 08:54.186
Ah!
Oh, that's so hot!

08:54.187 --> 08:56.453
What is that?
It's coffee.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.592
Hot coffee?

08:59.593 --> 09:02.061
Look at us, three rogue cops

09:02.095 --> 09:04.697
taking on a case the
commissioner told us to drop.

09:04.731 --> 09:06.165
Button up your jacket.
Sit up straight.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.868
Judge Mindel has a reputation
for being strict and proper.

09:08.869 --> 09:09.868
All right, no worries.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.303
I'll just act like you.

09:11.304 --> 09:13.806
Say something so I can get
the cadence of your voice down.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.407
I will not.
Perfect.

09:15.408 --> 09:18.210
I will not.
I... Will not.

09:18.211 --> 09:22.520
I will... Not.

09:22.549 --> 09:24.022
Have a seat, Detective.

09:24.050 --> 09:25.148
I will not.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.118
Excuse me?

09:26.119 --> 09:27.553
Uh, sorry.

09:27.554 --> 09:30.556
I meant out of respect,
I will choose to stand.

09:30.557 --> 09:33.459
Sit, I will not.

09:33.460 --> 09:37.163
This looks like it
was filled out by a toddler.

09:37.197 --> 09:40.366
Now, we're going to have to go
through this point by point.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.735
Justice cannot be rushed.

09:42.769 --> 09:46.071
But could it be
gently nudged into hyper speed?

09:46.106 --> 09:47.740
I take it you're the toddler.

09:48.842 --> 09:51.510
Excuse me a moment.
Mm-hmm.

09:51.511 --> 09:54.980
This is going terribly.
New plan.

09:54.981 --> 09:58.050
I'm gonna charm her.

09:58.051 --> 09:59.351
Oh, no.

09:59.386 --> 10:00.819
I'm sorry.
I had to take that.

10:00.854 --> 10:03.289
You gotta do what you gotta do.

10:03.323 --> 10:06.258
Captain Raymond Holt.

10:06.259 --> 10:09.462
What's up?

10:13.266 --> 10:14.233
You wanted to see me, sarge?

10:14.267 --> 10:16.335
Yeah, come on in, Boyle.

10:16.336 --> 10:17.336
Sorry to hear about your hand.

10:17.337 --> 10:18.571
Thanks.

10:18.572 --> 10:21.407
It makes it really hard
to manipulate my egg sack.

10:21.408 --> 10:23.209
Look.
Here's the deal.

10:23.243 --> 10:25.311
I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.

10:25.312 --> 10:28.581
And my girlfriend Chiaki?
She broke my heart.

10:40.994 --> 10:43.729
I stared at the paper walls for weeks

10:43.763 --> 10:46.932
until my roommates showed me
how to vent my feelings.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.206
Take a plate and smash it.

10:54.207 --> 10:56.275
Oh!

10:56.276 --> 10:57.476
Feels good.
Yeah!

10:57.477 --> 10:59.445
All right. Your turn, Boyle.
Okay.

10:59.446 --> 11:00.846
Vent those feelings!
Okay.

11:00.847 --> 11:03.482
Here we go, sarge.
Yeah.

11:04.851 --> 11:07.953
Oh, my testicles!

11:07.954 --> 11:09.955
We got a warrant.
But now, we need a plan.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.724
We can't just go
in there in our uniforms.

11:11.725 --> 11:14.627
They'll destroy the evidence before
we even walk through the door.

11:14.628 --> 11:16.428
Good point, Captain Holt,

11:16.429 --> 11:19.932
or should I say
"Captain Raymond sex vibes"?

11:19.966 --> 11:21.600
Who knew you had such game?

11:21.635 --> 11:25.070
Yes, I've found that many women
want what they can't have.

11:25.071 --> 11:27.072
I get it.
Ew.

11:27.107 --> 11:29.230
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

11:29.396 --> 11:31.577
According to
the community center calendar,

11:31.578 --> 11:33.484
amateur ballroom dancing competition.

11:33.650 --> 11:36.348
Ah, okay.

11:36.349 --> 11:38.050
I know how we're gonna blend in.

11:38.085 --> 11:41.787
- Don't say "thrift store."
- Thrift store!

11:49.262 --> 11:50.463
♪ I... ♪

11:50.464 --> 11:52.131
- ♪ I want to... ♪

11:52.132 --> 11:55.501

12:00.307 --> 12:02.775

12:02.776 --> 12:04.477
Jake, the overwhelming time pressure.

12:04.478 --> 12:05.611
Yep.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.467
All right, Isaac said the account book

12:09.468 --> 12:11.689
was in room 265.
It's gotta be upstairs.

12:11.704 --> 12:13.204
Let's head up.

12:13.205 --> 12:14.906
Hey.
Where you goin'?

12:14.940 --> 12:16.341
To the dance contest.

12:16.342 --> 12:19.177
I am nationally-recognized
fox-trotter Dave Blathis,

12:19.178 --> 12:24.082
and these are my proteges, Rhonda
Shawarma and Hank Frankel.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.450
I don't care who you are.

12:25.451 --> 12:27.085
Upstairs is closed to the public.

12:27.119 --> 12:28.286
Fine.

12:28.287 --> 12:32.724
But we didn't have to endure this
crap when we danced in Barcelona.

12:32.725 --> 12:34.626
The hearing's
starting any second.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.728
There may be another
staircase off the dance floor.

12:36.729 --> 12:37.896
I'll sign us up for the contest.

12:37.897 --> 12:39.364
Good idea.
Oh, and Amy.

12:39.365 --> 12:43.635
Hm? Your dress makes
you look like a mermaid.

12:43.636 --> 12:46.838
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

12:46.872 --> 12:48.673
I know we're all
concerned about Boyle,

12:48.674 --> 12:51.676
but again, there is a solution.

12:51.677 --> 12:54.979
Forget your ex with meaningless sex.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.484
It rhymes because it's true.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.049
All right, everyone.

12:58.084 --> 13:00.018
Peralta needs us to stall.

13:00.019 --> 13:01.920
So just keep your answers long.

13:01.954 --> 13:04.789
Add stuff.
Embellish your asses off.

13:04.790 --> 13:05.790
Boyle, you're first.

13:05.791 --> 13:08.293
I don't know if I'm up for this.

13:08.294 --> 13:11.029
I'm so emotional.
I can barely think straight.

13:11.063 --> 13:12.964
Great.
Use that.

13:12.965 --> 13:14.165
Embrace the void.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.101
Would you say Detective Peralta

13:16.102 --> 13:18.269
was overly interested
in the Wint case?

13:18.304 --> 13:21.706
I only heard Detective Peralta
talk about Lucas Wint once.

13:21.741 --> 13:23.007
<i>We were in my car.</i>

13:23.042 --> 13:26.611
I took Vivian on our first
real date in that car.

13:26.645 --> 13:28.850
Vivian is my fiancee.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.283
My ex-fiancee.

13:32.318 --> 13:33.785
My never-wife.

13:33.819 --> 13:35.887
Detective Boyle, if you could,

13:35.888 --> 13:37.956
please limit your comments
to the matter at hand.

13:37.957 --> 13:39.090
I will.

13:39.091 --> 13:40.792
I'd just like the record to reflect

13:40.793 --> 13:46.364
that "matter at hand" was one of
Vivian's favorite expressions.

13:46.365 --> 13:47.499
We should try to blend in.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.033
Stretch your leg up over your head.

13:49.068 --> 13:51.736
What? You stretch
your leg up over your head.

13:51.771 --> 13:53.104
You think I wouldn't if I could?

13:53.139 --> 13:54.272
Ugh.

13:54.273 --> 13:57.208
Ooh, looks like
the Captain found a partner.

13:57.243 --> 13:58.543
<i>Good lord.</i>

13:58.544 --> 14:04.538
Okay, we begin with a free-dance
period to the spicy sounds of rumba.

14:05.484 --> 14:09.120
All right.
The linoleum awaits, my dear.

14:09.155 --> 14:10.555
Oh, boy.

14:10.556 --> 14:12.123
I know we're undercover,
but I'm starting to get

14:12.124 --> 14:13.758
real nervous about this contest.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.326
You need to see a therapist.

14:15.361 --> 14:16.961
Yeah.
Let's dance this way.

14:16.996 --> 14:18.897
- Okay.
- Ho, hoo.

14:18.931 --> 14:21.700
How did you manage to step on
both of my feet at the same time?

14:21.734 --> 14:23.835
I'm horrible at this.
When can we stop?

14:23.869 --> 14:25.573
I'm horrible at this...
I know, I know.

14:26.072 --> 14:27.539
Title of my sex tape.

14:27.573 --> 14:28.773
<i>Huh, well done.</i>

14:28.774 --> 14:30.709
Title of my sex tape.

14:30.743 --> 14:32.510
Oh, my God, the Captain.

14:32.545 --> 14:34.913
He could really win this thing.

14:34.947 --> 14:36.648
How did you get so amazing at dancing?

14:36.682 --> 14:38.083
Jake, focus.

14:38.084 --> 14:39.718
I found a back stairway over here.

14:39.719 --> 14:41.786
And spin.

14:41.821 --> 14:43.655
Who is he?

14:43.689 --> 14:45.857
As far as I can recall,
Detective Peralta

14:45.858 --> 14:50.495
told me that...

14:50.496 --> 14:53.476
That...

14:53.899 --> 14:54.999
He...

14:55.034 --> 14:57.869
No, I never heard
Jake talk about Wint.

14:57.903 --> 14:59.838
And the very fact
that you have him on trial

14:59.839 --> 15:01.692
is cat-doing- <i>home-alone</i> -face.

15:01.858 --> 15:03.069
Of...

15:03.235 --> 15:04.776
Look, I've known Jake forever.

15:04.777 --> 15:07.645
Our friendship is little-boy-
holding-little-girl's-hand.

15:09.949 --> 15:13.585
God, that guard
by the door will not move.

15:13.586 --> 15:15.720
Uh-oh, he just made
eye contact with me.

15:15.721 --> 15:17.489
Play it cool.
Dance.

15:17.490 --> 15:18.523
Dance, dance, dance.

15:18.557 --> 15:19.691
You don't have to say "dance"

15:19.692 --> 15:21.659
every time you make a step.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.894
Good call.
Hey.

15:22.895 --> 15:25.096
Do you want me to actually
show you how to do this

15:25.097 --> 15:27.593
so you don't hurt yourself
and possibly others?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.599
Yes.
Okay.

15:28.601 --> 15:29.668
Ready?

15:29.669 --> 15:31.436
Mm-hmm.

15:35.408 --> 15:36.441
This is kinda fun.

15:36.442 --> 15:38.209
Yeah.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.979
Maybe Teddy and I should take a class.

15:40.980 --> 15:44.282
Yeah.
Maybe.

15:44.283 --> 15:45.450
Guys, we're running out of time.

15:45.451 --> 15:47.619
What's the plan?
That guard won't move.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.853
We need a distraction.

15:48.854 --> 15:49.853
I'm on it.

15:49.855 --> 15:52.023
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

15:52.024 --> 15:53.758
Oh, God!
Oh!

15:53.759 --> 15:55.827
My ankle!
Sir, my ankle!

15:55.828 --> 15:57.662
Oh, I heard a pop!
I heard a pop!

15:57.663 --> 15:59.197
<i>Is that bad?
Do you know if that's bad?</i>

15:59.198 --> 16:02.000
Oh, God!
Oh, I live to dance!

16:06.472 --> 16:09.407
Ah.
<i>Voila.</i>

16:09.442 --> 16:12.110
So glad no one heard me say that.

16:12.111 --> 16:14.079
Gotcha.

16:14.113 --> 16:15.880
Aw, this is incredible.

16:15.881 --> 16:17.349
The account books have everything.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.084
Dates, names, dollar amounts.

16:19.085 --> 16:21.286
I can't wait to show this to Podolski.

16:21.287 --> 16:24.621
I should probably slip in a
Miley-Cyrus-told-you-so face real quick.

16:24.924 --> 16:26.224
It's hard to do on the move.

16:26.225 --> 16:27.926
Peralta, wait.

16:28.361 --> 16:30.328
Santiago, give us a minute.

16:30.329 --> 16:31.329
Sir?

16:31.330 --> 16:32.397
I need you to do something.

16:32.398 --> 16:34.566
And it's gonna sound
crazy, but it's important,

16:34.567 --> 16:37.736
and I need you to trust me.

16:37.770 --> 16:39.671
So Detective Peralta...

16:39.705 --> 16:42.919
Do you have any evidence you'd
like to present on your behalf?

16:43.476 --> 16:45.243
No.

16:45.244 --> 16:47.278
I have nothing.

16:49.561 --> 16:51.562
Jake.
What happened?

16:51.563 --> 16:53.197
Did Holt ask you to get suspended?

16:53.198 --> 16:54.965
No, he told me to get fired.

16:54.966 --> 16:56.099
Why?
I don't know.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.301
I'm kind of freaking out.

16:57.302 --> 17:00.037
He said to do it, and the next
thing I knew, I was just yelling.

17:00.038 --> 17:03.140
And <i> your</i> mother!
All of your mothers.

17:03.141 --> 17:04.641
And your grandmothers.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.243
And your grandmothers' little dogs.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.645
Are you done?
No, I'm not done!

17:08.646 --> 17:11.155
Aw, you're done!
You can't handle the me!

17:11.182 --> 17:12.549
- Oh, my God.
<i>-  Peralta!</i>

17:12.584 --> 17:14.351
Hey.
What's goin' on?

17:14.352 --> 17:16.319
This is special agent Clarke
with the FBI.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.989
FBI?
We couldn't let you expose Lucas Wint.

17:18.990 --> 17:22.192
It would've compromised a much larger
ongoing federal investigation.

17:22.227 --> 17:25.162
We believe that Wint has ties
to the Ianucci crime family.

17:25.163 --> 17:26.829
That's one of the best crime families.

17:26.830 --> 17:28.499
We needed you to get fired for real

17:28.500 --> 17:31.135
because the Ianuccis
have moles inside the NYPD,

17:31.169 --> 17:32.636
and we need them to trust you.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.204
Detective, we'd
like you to go undercover

17:34.205 --> 17:35.639
and help us with the investigation.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.907
Okay, the answer is "yes."

17:36.908 --> 17:39.409
My name is Duncan buck.

17:39.410 --> 17:42.546
I was raised on a oil rig
by 90 men and 1 prostitute.

17:42.580 --> 17:43.814
We'd like you to be yourself.

17:43.815 --> 17:46.150
Even better.
This could be very dangerous.

17:46.151 --> 17:48.786
- So please, take some time, and...
- No need. I'm in.

17:48.787 --> 17:50.587
Eyes closed, head first, can't lose.

17:50.622 --> 17:52.189
I don't think that's the expression.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.282
Can you just let me have this?

17:55.293 --> 17:57.995
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

17:57.996 --> 17:59.163
Detective Peralta will be going

17:59.164 --> 18:01.064
in an undercover assignment
with the FBI.

18:01.099 --> 18:02.699
His cover story is that he was fired.

18:02.734 --> 18:04.535
Oh, my God.
My heart just threw up.

18:04.569 --> 18:05.936
Look, they're saying
this assignment will last

18:05.937 --> 18:07.938
about six months, so while I'm gone,

18:07.939 --> 18:10.073
Boyle, I want you to have my desk.

18:10.108 --> 18:11.575
I'll sit at it always.

18:11.609 --> 18:13.551
Rosa, you can have my locker.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.411
Sweet.

18:14.412 --> 18:16.747
Amy, you can have
all of my open cases.

18:16.748 --> 18:17.848
<i>Okay, that's enough.</i>

18:17.849 --> 18:20.517
Peralta doesn't have the
authority to do any of this.

18:20.518 --> 18:24.188
You will all sit at your own desk
and work the cases I assign you.

18:24.189 --> 18:27.825
But you will be missed.

18:27.826 --> 18:28.859
Thank you, Captain.

18:28.893 --> 18:32.896
Thank you for trusting me.

18:32.931 --> 18:34.498
Okay, now call us all names

18:34.499 --> 18:36.433
and storm out of here
for the benefit of the bullpen.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.202
This is the best day ever.

18:40.171 --> 18:41.805
I'll miss you guys.

18:41.806 --> 18:43.540
And your mother!

18:43.541 --> 18:45.309
And <i> your</i> mother.

18:45.343 --> 18:47.578
<i>You're all a bunch of pigs!</i>

18:47.579 --> 18:50.848
I smell bacon!

18:50.849 --> 18:52.983
And guess what else, "Captain"?

18:53.017 --> 18:57.821
You can take this tie and shove
it straight into your hellhole!

18:57.822 --> 19:00.924
This whole place reeks of bacon.

19:00.925 --> 19:02.192
And guess what?

19:02.193 --> 19:06.964
I'm going kosher 'cause
Jake-y don't dig on swine!

19:06.965 --> 19:07.978
Whoo!

19:07.979 --> 19:10.300
All right, everyone.
I wanna make a toast.

19:10.301 --> 19:12.369
To you guys.

19:12.370 --> 19:15.272
You will never be Jake or Vivian,
but at least you're here.

19:15.273 --> 19:18.375
Ugh, I'm gonna go over by the
bar where I can hear you worse.

19:18.376 --> 19:20.711
Oh, I get it.
I'd abandon me too.

19:20.712 --> 19:22.546
That's it.
Boyle, no more eggs.

19:22.547 --> 19:24.248
You are drinking your troubles away.

19:24.249 --> 19:25.449
Start with this.

19:25.450 --> 19:26.917
I'm gonna get some
bottles from the bar.

19:26.951 --> 19:29.820
Make way! Large man
helping his little friend.

19:29.821 --> 19:32.589
Comin' through!

19:32.590 --> 19:35.125
You're so lucky you've never
been through a painful breakup.

19:35.126 --> 19:36.226
The only reason
they haven't been painful

19:36.227 --> 19:39.263
is 'cause the guys were all losers.

19:39.264 --> 19:40.597
I've never dated anyone good.

19:40.632 --> 19:42.056
Hmm.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.202
Like you.

19:50.308 --> 19:51.809
Amy?

19:51.810 --> 19:53.143
Hey, thought I missed you.

19:53.144 --> 19:55.512
Hey, Jake.
Amazing assignment.

19:55.547 --> 19:58.215
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.

19:58.249 --> 19:59.717
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:59.718 --> 20:01.085
Well, if you want,
I could help you get fired.

20:01.086 --> 20:02.986
I'm really good at it.

20:03.021 --> 20:04.288
Yeah.

20:04.289 --> 20:06.223
This is real.
This is happening.

20:06.257 --> 20:08.225
Look...

20:08.226 --> 20:09.760
I don't wanna be a jerk.

20:09.761 --> 20:13.931
I know you're dating Teddy,
and it's going really well.

20:13.965 --> 20:16.465
It's just...
What's going on?

20:17.802 --> 20:19.503
I don't know what's gonna
happen on this assignment.

20:19.504 --> 20:22.306
And if something bad goes down,
I think I'd be pissed at myself

20:22.307 --> 20:24.241
if I didn't say this.

20:25.120 --> 20:31.408
I kinda wish something could happen
between us, romantic-styles.

20:32.183 --> 20:33.784
And I know it can't
'cause you're with Teddy,

20:33.785 --> 20:38.122
and I'm going undercover,
and that's just how it is.

20:38.123 --> 20:42.893
But...

20:42.894 --> 20:46.864
Anyway, we're not supposed to
have any contact, so I should go.

20:46.865 --> 20:48.465
America needs me.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.501
Bye.

20:53.405 --> 20:55.672
And another round for everyone on me!

20:55.673 --> 20:56.974
Thanks, buddy.

20:56.975 --> 20:57.975
What's the occasion?

20:57.976 --> 20:59.843
Oh, I'm celebrating.

20:59.844 --> 21:05.983
My name's Jake Peralta,
and I just got fired from the NYPD.

21:05.984 --> 21:09.953
I'm Leo...
Ianucci.

21:09.954 --> 21:13.157
Nice to meet you.
