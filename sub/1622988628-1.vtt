00:05.181 --> 00:08.180
(suspenseful music)

00:23.342 --> 00:27.860
- [Announcer] Coming soon
from Love Shack International!

00:27.860 --> 00:30.360
(eerie music)

00:40.900 --> 00:43.900
(suspenseful music)

02:05.001 --> 02:09.001
(crowd chattering and laughing)

02:26.079 --> 02:27.740
(popping)

02:27.740 --> 02:28.870
- Oh.

02:28.870 --> 02:33.120
- You might want to slow down
a little bit there, soldier.

02:33.120 --> 02:33.953
- Oh.

02:35.370 --> 02:38.458
I haven't had anything to
drink in quite a while, so

02:38.458 --> 02:41.107
I better indulge myself just a little bit.

02:41.107 --> 02:43.340
And I'm kind of sick of
corn liquor, you know,

02:43.340 --> 02:45.240
because, you know, well,

02:45.240 --> 02:46.506
you see what's around us.
- Corn, yeah.

02:46.506 --> 02:47.339
- Yeah.

02:47.339 --> 02:48.172
- I get that.

02:48.172 --> 02:49.005
Well I'm just glad

02:49.005 --> 02:51.570
that you came back with me after Cornfest.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.329
I feel privileged.

02:53.329 --> 02:56.329
You're the winner of
the corn eating contest.

02:56.329 --> 02:57.680
- Well, you know,

02:57.680 --> 03:01.062
I have an affinity for corn, and,

03:01.062 --> 03:04.462
(corn rustling)

03:04.462 --> 03:06.045
Mmmm, and, you know

03:07.600 --> 03:11.290
I figured that I'm the king of this area

03:11.290 --> 03:14.130
and I figured I could
eat my weight in corn.

03:14.130 --> 03:16.100
And by god, I'm gonna do so.

03:16.100 --> 03:16.970
- Sounds like it.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.680
But I tell you what, the corn around here,

03:19.680 --> 03:21.660
I hear they use growth hormones,

03:21.660 --> 03:23.130
and all kinds of weird stuff.

03:23.130 --> 03:26.110
Like I even heard people
have seen lights around here,

03:26.110 --> 03:27.900
and some people are even saying

03:27.900 --> 03:32.000
there are some alien growth
hormone rays or something?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.260
- Alien growth what?

03:34.260 --> 03:35.093
Alien growth hormone?

03:35.093 --> 03:37.961
- I read it in your brother's newspaper.

03:37.961 --> 03:39.160
- Oh.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.570
I guess.

03:40.570 --> 03:41.403
Yeah I guess he don't get,

03:41.403 --> 03:43.440
he'll do anything to get news these days.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.460
- No, I mean he's got,

03:44.460 --> 03:45.960
have you seen his YouTube channel?

03:45.960 --> 03:48.773
He's got video of Bigfoot.

03:49.804 --> 03:52.561
- It's probably his wife,
you know, dressed up

03:52.561 --> 03:53.420
in some kind of
- No, I heard.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.700
- For the movies.
- I heard Dilbert

03:54.700 --> 03:56.963
came out here, and nobody's seen him.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.490
- And she doesn't shave her legs,

03:59.490 --> 04:00.586
it could have just been her

04:00.586 --> 04:02.320
and they could have been doing something,

04:02.320 --> 04:03.802
God knows what, I mean.

04:03.802 --> 04:06.434
- [Woman] Whatever, you've
had too much to drink.

04:06.434 --> 04:07.909
- [Man] Oh, I'm just getting started.

04:07.909 --> 04:12.228
- No, I think we need to get
up and get some exercise.

04:12.228 --> 04:13.062
- Oh.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.257
- What do you say if we play

04:16.219 --> 04:18.279
a little hide and seek out here,

04:18.279 --> 04:20.529
see if there is a monster out there

04:20.529 --> 04:24.184
and maybe you might find
me in my birthday suit?

04:24.184 --> 04:25.793
(corn rustling)
- Well, I tell you what.

04:26.650 --> 04:29.644
I'll give you a 10 swig head start.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.550
(woman laughing)
(playful music)

04:32.550 --> 04:33.820
- 10 swigs and I don't think

04:33.820 --> 04:35.370
you're gonna make it off this blanket.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.023
But, let's see.

04:40.110 --> 04:40.943
- Ooh.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.663
- Come on!

04:48.788 --> 04:50.303
Get your drunk ass up, buddy!

04:51.231 --> 04:54.228
- All right, baby, ready or not,

04:54.228 --> 04:55.228
here I come!

04:56.249 --> 04:57.640
- Hey!

04:57.640 --> 04:59.403
Come on, Corn King!

05:00.830 --> 05:03.043
I got something you're gonna want.

05:04.610 --> 05:05.943
- Actually, ooh!

05:08.100 --> 05:10.463
Oh, my goodness, what do we got here?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.663
Oooh, baby!

05:16.898 --> 05:19.000
(corn rustling)

05:19.000 --> 05:20.110
- Did you find that?

05:21.910 --> 05:23.563
I got something else for you too.

05:28.270 --> 05:30.013
Drunk ass motherfucker, find that.

05:34.937 --> 05:35.770
- Oh!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.130
Oh yeah baby,

05:38.130 --> 05:40.457
I think there's a monster in here now.

05:40.457 --> 05:42.153
Just wait till I get my pants down.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.023
Ooh.

05:48.820 --> 05:51.440
- Hello, Mr. Drunky.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.361
Got another thing for ya!

05:54.361 --> 05:55.861
What in the hell?!

05:58.760 --> 06:00.920
Is that a corn cob?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.440
Or are you just happy to see me?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.883
Weird ass scarecrow.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.347
Well here you go.

06:08.347 --> 06:12.340
'Cause my man's probably
drunk somewhere passed out.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.173
You're not.

06:15.564 --> 06:16.620
All right, come get me,

06:16.620 --> 06:18.410
you got competition, boy!

06:20.959 --> 06:21.792
- Oh, god.

06:23.714 --> 06:24.687
Who the?

06:24.687 --> 06:26.660
Who the hell is that?

06:26.660 --> 06:28.883
Hey babe, what kind of
kinky shit are you into?

06:33.914 --> 06:37.363
I'm just gonna sit and relax
for a minute. (groaning)

06:43.476 --> 06:45.558
- Where the hell are you?

06:47.260 --> 06:48.263
Oh my god.

06:49.215 --> 06:51.715
(man snoring)

06:52.793 --> 06:55.082
I'm gonna leave you one
more thing down here.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.393
Best be finding it for me.

07:07.817 --> 07:09.982
(man snoring)

07:09.982 --> 07:11.623
(sighing) Oh my god.

07:12.972 --> 07:14.470
I think I'm gonna go take my chances

07:14.470 --> 07:17.423
with the corn stalk dude back there.

07:18.342 --> 07:20.253
At least the shark had a hard-on.

07:21.950 --> 07:22.913
All right.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.007
You got one more chance.

07:30.031 --> 07:31.448
Come and get 'em!

07:33.267 --> 07:36.017
(shark growling)

07:47.448 --> 07:48.942
Where the hell is he?

07:48.942 --> 07:53.037
(tense music)
(shark growling)

07:53.037 --> 07:53.870
Shark!

07:57.847 --> 08:00.597
(shark growling)

08:02.409 --> 08:04.971
(woman screaming)

08:04.971 --> 08:07.638
(jaws munching)

08:18.547 --> 08:21.169
(shark growling)

08:21.169 --> 08:23.836
(corn rustling)

08:26.127 --> 08:28.627
(eerie music)

09:13.585 --> 09:16.168
(man laughing)

09:18.582 --> 09:21.209
(shark roaring)

09:21.209 --> 09:24.042
(woman screaming)

09:27.672 --> 09:29.837
(shark roaring)

09:29.837 --> 09:32.284
(woman screaming)

09:32.284 --> 09:35.034
(shark growling)

09:42.228 --> 09:44.811
(man growling)

10:06.845 --> 10:10.510
(thunder clapping)

10:10.510 --> 10:11.760
- Time to kill.

10:24.138 --> 10:26.070
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:26.070 --> 10:28.060
I just don't want you
to worry about me, okay?

10:28.060 --> 10:31.110
And don't send anybody
here to check on me.

10:31.110 --> 10:33.240
I hate when it's totally dark.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.723
Hey, sis, I've gotta go, okay?

10:38.070 --> 10:40.220
Okay, yeah, I'll talk
to you in a little bit.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.120
Okay, bye.

10:45.460 --> 10:46.793
Wow, look at you.

10:48.840 --> 10:52.760
You're all dressed up an incognito.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.460
I thought the coronavirus is over by now.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.103
Or so I thought anyway.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.623
Are you looking to party by chance?

11:10.410 --> 11:11.653
Do you have a room here?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.123
Okay, here's the deal.

11:18.540 --> 11:22.730
It's 60 up front and 60 when we're done.

11:22.730 --> 11:23.563
Is that okay?

11:31.120 --> 11:33.223
Now aren't you the true gentleman?

11:33.223 --> 11:34.923
With all those teeth.

11:37.228 --> 11:39.470
With all those sharp teeth,

11:39.470 --> 11:43.573
I bet you love to bite,
don't you? (chuckling)

11:52.920 --> 11:54.410
Oh, wow!

11:54.410 --> 11:57.053
Oh my god, look at all of this cool stuff!

11:59.020 --> 12:02.513
Dude, you must really be
into sharks or something.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.400
You know, you can bite me

12:07.400 --> 12:08.613
at no extra charge.

12:11.738 --> 12:12.571
Oh my god!

12:15.276 --> 12:17.463
Like what is all of this stuff?

12:19.077 --> 12:22.244
(lightly tense music)

12:33.506 --> 12:34.830
- The Great White.

12:34.830 --> 12:37.173
It's the greatest
creature that ever lived.

12:38.118 --> 12:39.560
- Hmm.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.723
- They are goddesses.

12:43.170 --> 12:47.910
Sharks are older than trees,
you know, and dinosaurs.

12:47.910 --> 12:52.343
450 million years old.

12:53.210 --> 12:56.803
They don't age, they don't get cancer.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.053
Strong, fearless.

13:03.570 --> 13:04.583
Merciless.

13:07.810 --> 13:09.540
The only species to have survived

13:09.540 --> 13:11.273
four out of the five extinctions.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.623
Nobody knows the power of the Great White.

13:18.043 --> 13:19.543
But they're about to find out.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.323
We are one with them.

13:27.217 --> 13:29.780
- Okay, so what are you like,

13:29.780 --> 13:31.650
a Marine Biologist or something?

13:31.650 --> 13:36.650
Like George Costanza? (laughing)

13:37.850 --> 13:39.277
- Yeah it's something like that.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.363
- Oh, okay.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.593
- He's an inspiration.

13:43.433 --> 13:48.066
- Hmm. (laughing)

13:52.495 --> 13:54.935
Ooh, what do you have here?

13:54.935 --> 13:55.768
(man laughing)

13:55.768 --> 13:59.061
That's a nice big set
of teeth you have there.

13:59.061 --> 14:00.437
- Mhmm.

14:00.437 --> 14:01.753
Do you like those?
- Are you gonna

14:01.753 --> 14:03.861
bite me with this or something?

14:03.861 --> 14:06.944
- Oh, you are so good at what you do.

14:12.542 --> 14:14.168
Try this on.

14:14.168 --> 14:16.053
- I'm gonna wear this like a crown?

14:18.416 --> 14:21.243
(sinister music)
(woman screaming)

14:21.243 --> 14:23.826
(man snarling)

14:33.126 --> 14:35.876
(shark growling)

14:42.822 --> 14:45.072
(whacking)

14:52.151 --> 14:54.984
- All hail Carcharodon carcharias!

14:57.130 --> 15:00.880
The true goddesses of this world!

15:00.880 --> 15:04.470
This is your bidding, Chichimatul.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.598
This is my offering.

15:06.598 --> 15:11.598
All true believers will persevere

15:12.420 --> 15:16.083
in the war that is about to conclude!

15:19.375 --> 15:21.910
My work is near complete.

15:33.647 --> 15:36.897
(tense drumming music)

16:01.183 --> 16:03.850
(corn rustling)

16:13.435 --> 16:16.018
(man grunting)

16:18.146 --> 16:20.813
(ominous music)

16:27.424 --> 16:29.591
(sighing)

16:43.790 --> 16:46.373
(somber music)

17:05.339 --> 17:07.240
- So tell me again what happened here.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.140
- The last thing I remember

17:10.140 --> 17:12.950
is that we came back from the festival,

17:12.950 --> 17:16.040
and that we decided to
have some alone time,

17:16.040 --> 17:17.864
and I kinda want to spend a little,

17:17.864 --> 17:20.329
you know, a little time
with Susan, you know?

17:20.329 --> 17:24.550
Anyway, we decided to have a few drinks,

17:24.550 --> 17:27.400
and things got a little heated

17:27.400 --> 17:30.780
and we decided to play a
little strip and go seek.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.623
And she took off.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.540
- So in other words,
you made a pass at her,

17:36.540 --> 17:39.360
she didn't like it, she got pissed off,

17:39.360 --> 17:40.870
you got too aggressive,

17:40.870 --> 17:42.810
and then she bought off?

17:42.810 --> 17:44.490
- Wait, no, Constable.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.110
It was absolutely nothing like that.

17:46.110 --> 17:50.090
I mean, I had a few drinks and we were

17:50.090 --> 17:51.090
running through here,

17:51.090 --> 17:53.830
I was picking up her
clothes as we went along,

17:53.830 --> 17:56.030
and things were getting exciting.

17:56.030 --> 17:58.215
And I just must have had too much to drink

17:58.215 --> 18:00.000
and I passed out.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.327
- And you didn't see
anything or hear anything?

18:03.327 --> 18:06.250
- I mean, no I didn't, honest to God.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.090
You gotta believe me, I didn't.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.563
- Well, what do you make
of that mauling she got?

18:11.650 --> 18:12.860
- From the looks of things, it looks,

18:12.860 --> 18:14.210
I mean it could have been a wild animal.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.060
I mean, it could have been a Bigfoot.

18:16.950 --> 18:19.150
- Bigfoot, aliens?

18:19.150 --> 18:20.693
You and your brother Jonathan
would like that wouldn't you?

18:20.693 --> 18:23.810
It'd be great press and
publicity for his newspaper

18:23.810 --> 18:25.200
and real estate ventures.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.230
Get people to come out here

18:26.230 --> 18:29.400
and buy some of these farms,
look for old Sasquatch.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.403
By the way, your brother, where is he?

18:32.476 --> 18:35.400
- I don't know, it's not
like I keep up with him.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.900
- Don't get smart with me, Gary.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.600
We got ourselves a murder
investigation here.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.150
Susan Blake was a beautiful,

18:41.150 --> 18:42.900
well loved woman in these parts.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.170
Church goer.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.830
She was a librarian for God's sakes!

18:46.830 --> 18:48.610
I'm inclined to believe
that you and your brother

18:48.610 --> 18:51.500
had something to do with
this for your own reasons.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.639
That's what I'm talking about, bubba.

18:53.639 --> 18:54.540
- Seriously?

18:54.540 --> 18:56.840
I mean, have you seen
the bites and scratches?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.003
- I've seen them.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.390
You guys could have made anything up

19:00.390 --> 19:01.350
to make that happen.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.710
And it got all creature features

19:02.710 --> 19:05.120
with some device or something like that.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.770
Where'd you say your brother was?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.600
- As far as I know, he was in Lexington

19:09.600 --> 19:14.193
doing a real estate videoing
and showing some houses.

19:15.540 --> 19:17.170
Doing his damn job.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.350
- Well, I wanna talk with him.

19:19.350 --> 19:22.000
In the meantime, I'm
gonna take your fat ass

19:22.000 --> 19:23.250
down to the station,

19:23.250 --> 19:24.650
I'm gonna process you

19:24.650 --> 19:26.950
and then we're gonna
investigate this further.

19:28.610 --> 19:29.857
- Whatever, flathead.

19:33.599 --> 19:38.080
- Officer Rosenberg, anything
from our field team out there?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.787
- Just a scarecrow with a shark head,

19:42.021 --> 19:43.763
and Susan's tracks,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.403
and lots and lots of condoms.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.820
Should we close the cornfield?

19:52.820 --> 19:55.830
- No, no, I don't think we
should be closing the cornfields.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.080
We got everything we need right here.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.630
Besides, it's harvest season.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.183
People gotta pay their bills.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.050
- Right.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.535
- Shark scarecrow?

20:05.535 --> 20:06.368
Huh!

20:08.370 --> 20:11.287
(insects chirping)

20:12.139 --> 20:15.139
(suspenseful music)

20:36.107 --> 20:38.274
(bashing)

20:56.275 --> 20:58.608
(whooshing)

21:58.168 --> 22:01.835
(electronic noise sounding)

22:10.643 --> 22:12.810
(zapping)

22:27.200 --> 22:30.117
(thunder clapping)

22:37.798 --> 22:41.131
(crackling and zapping)

22:46.089 --> 22:48.756
(alarm blaring)

23:03.840 --> 23:06.673
(buzzer sounding)

23:08.708 --> 23:11.708
(explosion booming)

23:16.553 --> 23:21.553
(chill music)
(birds chirping)

23:59.634 --> 24:01.004
- Any problems?

24:01.004 --> 24:04.760
- Not like we haven't faced
third world shitholes before.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.327
- All right.

24:06.327 --> 24:08.270
Let me get your money.

24:08.270 --> 24:11.330
Half now, half after I sell the item

24:11.330 --> 24:12.820
like we agreed.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.417
- Sounds like a deal to
me, let's make it happen.

24:35.065 --> 24:37.898
(darts whooshing)

24:40.614 --> 24:41.447
Fucker!

24:46.690 --> 24:49.880
- Sorry to be a Danny Downer, guys,

24:49.880 --> 24:52.397
but this is just too important.

24:54.010 --> 24:56.323
Life, it's rougher than a cob, ain't it?

24:58.410 --> 25:00.560
Get a good nap in while
I finish this work.

25:17.275 --> 25:19.775
(light music)

25:22.600 --> 25:23.433
- Where are you?

25:28.590 --> 25:30.253
I know I saw you in here.

25:33.634 --> 25:36.301
(corn rustling)

25:39.800 --> 25:40.983
Come to mama.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.583
My, my, my!

25:53.590 --> 25:56.053
What big feet you have.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.523
I guess I'll just have to
follow your footprints.

26:15.550 --> 26:16.559
(creature snarling)

26:16.559 --> 26:19.476
(woman exclaiming)

26:21.874 --> 26:23.990
(creature growling)

26:23.990 --> 26:25.743
Wait, Sasquatch!

26:27.070 --> 26:28.672
Come back!

26:28.672 --> 26:29.923
Come back!

26:32.012 --> 26:35.815
(creature growling)

26:35.815 --> 26:36.648
Come back!

26:41.948 --> 26:45.031
(light guitar music)

26:48.270 --> 26:49.650
- Hi, I'm Jonathan Gottlieb,

26:49.650 --> 26:51.300
and I'm here to offer you a little slice

26:51.300 --> 26:53.560
of Kentucky Magic right
here at Druid Hills.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.090
You can be a monster hunter!

26:56.090 --> 26:58.150
You can look around for all the creatures

26:58.150 --> 26:59.340
the locals say they see.

26:59.340 --> 27:00.210
And if you're interested,

27:00.210 --> 27:02.220
I'm ready to sell you a property today!

27:02.220 --> 27:03.896
1-800-BIGFEET!

27:03.896 --> 27:06.727
That's right 1-800-BIGFEET
for John Gottlieb, that's me.

27:06.727 --> 27:09.240
We're Druid Hills Realty all the way!

27:22.368 --> 27:24.868
(light music)

27:29.593 --> 27:31.784
(chuckling)

27:31.784 --> 27:34.557
(sighing)

27:34.557 --> 27:36.790
- Gottlieb, I swear.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.850
You make sure you stay in Druid Hills

27:38.850 --> 27:40.843
with that baloney sandwich stuff.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.420
We got enough problems in this world

27:43.420 --> 27:47.080
without adding Bigfoot
to the mix. (sighing)

27:55.002 --> 27:57.502
(tense music)

27:59.873 --> 28:02.373
(light music)

28:10.690 --> 28:12.390
Scheider to Grossman, do you copy?

28:15.150 --> 28:16.900
- [Grossman] Copy, Chief, go ahead.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.030
- You got anything going on out there?

28:22.390 --> 28:24.240
- [Grossman] No ma'am, hot day.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.343
Candice saw bandits.

28:26.180 --> 28:29.560
Hey, I had Gardner drive by Lorna's place.

28:29.560 --> 28:30.803
Still no sign of her.

28:34.990 --> 28:36.353
- Okay, over and out.

28:38.810 --> 28:39.960
- [Grossman] Out, babe.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.940
- I don't think that's protocol, sir.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.690
We wouldn't want another
visit to the HR now, would we?

28:51.559 --> 28:54.327
- [Grossman] Oh, ah,
sorry about that, Chief.

28:56.530 --> 28:57.700
- Over and out.

29:02.823 --> 29:05.323
(tense music)

29:09.636 --> 29:11.053
That looks weird.

29:13.427 --> 29:16.094
(siren blaring)

29:58.410 --> 29:59.533
Hey, Mr. Shark.

30:01.404 --> 30:03.454
Got your license and registration on you?

30:04.744 --> 30:07.327
(man growling)

30:09.556 --> 30:12.389
(camera clicking)

30:24.262 --> 30:25.555
Get out of the car!

30:25.555 --> 30:28.263
Get out of the car now!
(camera clicking)

30:28.263 --> 30:30.763
(eerie music)

30:33.727 --> 30:35.220
Put your hands up where I can see 'em.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.650
Put your hands up!

30:36.650 --> 30:41.641
Put your fucking hands up!
(camera clicking)

30:41.641 --> 30:42.540
What is this crap?!
(camera clicking)

30:42.540 --> 30:43.700
- Where's your dildo, cop?

30:43.700 --> 30:44.980
- Get up against the car.

30:48.303 --> 30:50.224
(man growling)

30:50.224 --> 30:52.891
(man screaming)

30:54.274 --> 30:56.201
I've got you now, you stupid fucking-

30:56.201 --> 30:57.034
(camera clicking)

30:57.034 --> 30:59.670
- You don't know what
the fuck you're doing!

30:59.670 --> 31:01.203
- I know what I'm doing!

31:02.220 --> 31:03.678
Get down on the fucking ground!

31:03.678 --> 31:04.560
(camera clicking)

31:04.560 --> 31:06.623
- What are you, some fucking monkey, huh?

31:07.756 --> 31:10.271
That's excessive force, pig!

31:10.271 --> 31:12.250
- [Chief] It's gonna
get even more excessive,

31:12.250 --> 31:13.083
you piece of shit!

31:13.083 --> 31:15.607
(man groaning)

31:18.850 --> 31:20.697
- I'm gonna bite you in half.

31:20.697 --> 31:22.147
- You're not gonna bite shit!

31:23.445 --> 31:24.451
Roll over.

31:24.451 --> 31:27.034
(man groaning)

31:28.735 --> 31:30.024
(camera clicking)

31:30.024 --> 31:32.274
(laughing)

31:33.739 --> 31:35.440
- This is great.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.690
It's all for Chichimatul.

31:41.571 --> 31:42.404
- You have the

31:42.404 --> 31:43.470
right to remain-
(camera clicking)

31:43.470 --> 31:47.206
- Why don't you sit on my
face, you fucking pig?!

31:47.206 --> 31:48.208
- Anything you say or do

31:48.208 --> 31:49.778
can be used against you
(camera clicking)

31:49.778 --> 31:51.132
in a court of law.

31:51.132 --> 31:53.200
- (laughing) Court of law?

31:53.200 --> 31:55.203
You're not gonna make
it to the court of law.

31:55.203 --> 31:57.440
- [Chief] Neither are you, you shark boy,

31:57.440 --> 31:59.493
if you keep this fucking shit up!

32:00.668 --> 32:01.751
- Well, well.

32:03.496 --> 32:05.496
Don't you look familiar.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.224
(ominous music)

32:10.290 --> 32:13.347
- Grossman, I need you to
send some backup right now.

32:15.514 --> 32:17.014
- [Grossman] 10-4.

32:18.361 --> 32:19.882
(man laughing)

32:19.882 --> 32:20.715
- Hurry.

32:22.645 --> 32:25.395
(drone whirring)

32:33.349 --> 32:35.932
(serene music)

33:10.416 --> 33:12.916
(eerie music)

33:24.873 --> 33:27.456
(serene music)

33:38.610 --> 33:41.110
(tense music)

33:45.395 --> 33:48.062
(phone ringing)

33:50.000 --> 33:52.970
- Yes, Gary, how many
times are you gonna call?

33:52.970 --> 33:54.326
This is like the 500th.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.410
I'm really busy right...

33:58.350 --> 33:59.440
Jail?

33:59.440 --> 34:00.790
What are you talking about?

34:02.987 --> 34:05.191
What do you mean murder?

34:05.191 --> 34:06.790
Okay, okay, just calm down.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.780
Look, I'll be there as fast as I can.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.143
Just hang tight, brother.

34:17.601 --> 34:22.601
(tense music)
(steps rustling)

34:24.320 --> 34:27.070
(birds chirping)

34:55.679 --> 34:58.710
- Benchley, I see you made it.

34:58.710 --> 35:01.540
I wish I could say I'm glad to see you.

35:01.540 --> 35:02.990
- Always a pleasure, Jeffrey.

35:04.607 --> 35:06.613
I see you have your goon squad with you.

35:09.749 --> 35:11.580
- You know you can't be too careful

35:11.580 --> 35:14.545
when you're chasing diamonds in the sky.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.095
- You can never be too careful.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.610
- Certainly.

35:21.610 --> 35:23.233
- So, do you have the item?

35:24.770 --> 35:26.430
- Of course I do.

35:26.430 --> 35:28.963
Not exactly with me, but it's close by.

35:30.230 --> 35:33.993
- So there's a trust issue?

35:35.460 --> 35:37.323
- Sounds like there's a trust issue.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.423
- Let's just say I want
to get the money first.

35:46.730 --> 35:50.430
And then I'll give you the map

35:50.430 --> 35:52.370
that tells you where the item is.

35:52.370 --> 35:53.323
- So where is it?

35:55.410 --> 35:56.243
- Close by.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.340
Do you have the money?

36:10.210 --> 36:11.043
Nice.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.163
All you guys have such
great personalities.

36:16.010 --> 36:17.710
Each one unique and different too.

36:18.980 --> 36:21.560
- Oh, it's so nice of you to notice.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.263
So there is a trust issue.

36:25.330 --> 36:27.830
- I'm not quite sure if
you all are the good guys.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.580
- Murray, Murray, Murray.

36:31.580 --> 36:32.413
Where have you been?

36:32.413 --> 36:34.653
We're two decades into
the 21st century, man.

36:35.610 --> 36:39.203
There are no good guys
anymore, just greycoats.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.026
Blending of the dark and the light.

36:44.026 --> 36:47.693
Little bit of this and
a little bit of that.

36:48.568 --> 36:50.430
- Little bit of this,

36:50.430 --> 36:51.680
and a little bit of that.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.546
- Will you just shut up?

36:55.546 --> 36:57.213
- [Thug] Sorry boss.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.303
- And by the way,

37:01.200 --> 37:02.830
you'll notice, Murray,

37:02.830 --> 37:06.110
you don't see any of us
wearing any shark tooth

37:06.110 --> 37:08.460
necklaces or bracelets.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.453
- Gray suits with white bellies.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.593
Just like sharks.

37:14.010 --> 37:15.180
Ready to maul the world.

37:15.180 --> 37:17.770
- Well, well, Murray it really depends

37:17.770 --> 37:21.020
on things like agenda and perspective

37:21.020 --> 37:22.740
if you know what I mean.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.810
- I don't like this guy.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.290
I don't trust him.

37:25.290 --> 37:28.053
- So, do you want the money now or not?

37:29.040 --> 37:29.873
- I guess I do.

37:31.697 --> 37:33.960
And to get as far away
from here as possible.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.650
- Well, you can try.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.900
And the money'll surely
give you that option.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.407
- [Tall Thug] Watch my back.

38:06.860 --> 38:08.603
- Go get that Chichimatul pup.

38:10.582 --> 38:15.582
- We're on this shit.

38:15.802 --> 38:17.135
- They're on it.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.233
- They're on it.

38:32.273 --> 38:34.180
- I'm not saying I don't trust you.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.607
I just don't trust you.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.720
- It ain't light, you can trust me.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.723
- You can trust him.

38:45.007 --> 38:49.328
- So it says that it's in
one of these, so let's look.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.044
- Yeah, it's gotta be
right over here somewhere.

38:52.044 --> 38:54.242
I think it might be,

38:54.242 --> 38:55.909
did we pass the row?

38:57.530 --> 38:58.363
Wait, what's that?

38:58.363 --> 39:00.064
- Wait, hold on, hold this.

39:00.064 --> 39:00.897
I'll look.

39:04.345 --> 39:05.928
I think I found it!

39:07.904 --> 39:12.232
(thunder clapping rumbling)

39:12.232 --> 39:14.482
(laughing)

39:15.867 --> 39:17.219
- Oh yes!

39:17.219 --> 39:18.052
We got it.

39:19.240 --> 39:22.407
(electricity zapping)

39:26.859 --> 39:27.692
Shark!

39:29.408 --> 39:32.075
(corn rustling)

39:36.205 --> 39:37.798
Come on!

39:37.798 --> 39:39.049
Come on!

39:39.049 --> 39:40.046
(kid screaming)

39:40.046 --> 39:42.888
(screaming)

39:42.888 --> 39:45.721
(thugs screaming)

39:50.247 --> 39:52.449
- Go, kill it, what are you doing!?

39:52.449 --> 39:54.782
(screaming)

39:56.561 --> 39:59.394
(thugs screaming)

40:09.123 --> 40:14.123
(thugs screaming)
(shark growling)

40:24.964 --> 40:27.714
(shark growling)

40:28.549 --> 40:31.216
(corn rustling)

40:39.700 --> 40:40.950
- Double cross!

40:40.950 --> 40:41.860
- Double cross!

40:41.860 --> 40:43.293
- You and your partners!

40:48.210 --> 40:50.103
- Impossible, I silenced them all!

40:54.853 --> 40:56.200
- Angelo.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.638
Go get the Chichimatul pup.

40:58.638 --> 40:59.950
Go get the pup!

40:59.950 --> 41:00.895
- Go get the pup!

41:00.895 --> 41:01.728
- Get the pup!

41:01.728 --> 41:02.561
- I'm sorry, boss!

41:09.417 --> 41:11.834
(gun firing)

41:15.340 --> 41:16.220
- Benchley!

41:16.220 --> 41:17.927
Get back here, you scoundrel!

41:26.570 --> 41:29.320
(steps rustling)

41:37.351 --> 41:40.101
(shark growling)

41:47.493 --> 41:49.660
(buzzing)

42:09.979 --> 42:13.540
(thunder rumbling)

42:13.540 --> 42:16.290
(shark growling)

42:36.768 --> 42:39.268
(tense music)

42:46.117 --> 42:49.284
(buzzing and zapping)

42:53.237 --> 42:54.070
- Benchley's got the,

42:54.070 --> 42:55.560
he's got the shark pup,

42:55.560 --> 42:57.260
he's got the money, he's got both!

42:59.277 --> 43:00.194
- Benchley!

43:01.317 --> 43:04.130
Benchley, you're finished!

43:04.130 --> 43:05.350
- You're finished!

43:05.350 --> 43:06.348
I'm so tired.

43:06.348 --> 43:07.498
I don't even wanna eat!

43:09.920 --> 43:12.787
The shark's got Joey and Zoey.

43:12.787 --> 43:14.237
You and me go after Benchley.

43:15.573 --> 43:17.410
- No, that won't be necessary.

43:17.410 --> 43:20.260
I planned ahead, I planted
a GPS tracking device

43:20.260 --> 43:21.750
in that money bag.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.733
We're gonna be on them like wrath.

43:25.590 --> 43:27.468
- Then off to the eggbeater!

43:27.468 --> 43:28.385
- Let's go.

43:33.206 --> 43:36.039
(camera clicking)

43:39.620 --> 43:42.320
- Now Teddy, we're gonna
start at the beginning again.

43:43.550 --> 43:44.890
Is that okay?

43:44.890 --> 43:45.723
- Yeah.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.127
Sure, you got another milkshake on you?

43:50.100 --> 43:50.933
- When we begin.

43:51.811 --> 43:54.480
(Teddy belching)

43:54.480 --> 43:56.030
This time I'm gonna record you.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.330
Just so you know.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.320
- Yeah, that's fine.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.580
The end is almost upon us anyway, sweety.

44:05.813 --> 44:09.900
Kind of a outdated recorder
machine you got there, huh?

44:09.900 --> 44:12.483
- It's mine from home, if you must know.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.070
And defunding, and the budget cuts

44:16.070 --> 44:17.610
from our police departments,

44:17.610 --> 44:20.140
it's happening everywhere, you know?

44:20.140 --> 44:21.270
- I believe it.

44:21.270 --> 44:23.303
Great White Lives Matter, you know.

44:24.879 --> 44:27.243
- Okay Teddy, that was funny.

44:29.710 --> 44:30.543
Right.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.103
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.553
Okay, so.

44:41.620 --> 44:44.200
Okay, I'm with Teddy Bo Lucas

44:44.200 --> 44:48.010
in interrogation room
B in Chance Kentucky.

44:48.010 --> 44:50.810
The date is September 13th.

44:50.810 --> 44:54.313
And he's speaking to me
of his own free will,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.980
waiving the right to a
lawyer, right, Teddy?

44:58.980 --> 45:00.323
- Correcto mundo.

45:01.542 --> 45:02.940
Another milkshake please?

45:02.940 --> 45:04.223
Maybe some fries?

45:08.160 --> 45:10.077
- Well, you're in luck.

45:14.516 --> 45:16.433
- All right, all right.

45:17.470 --> 45:19.320
- As I was saying,

45:19.320 --> 45:21.894
Teddy also has the right to remain silent.

45:21.894 --> 45:24.770
(Teddy belching)

45:24.770 --> 45:27.460
Anything he says or does

45:27.460 --> 45:29.843
can be used against him in a court of law.

45:32.020 --> 45:33.730
He has waived his right to an attorney

45:33.730 --> 45:36.060
and has been told that one
would be provided for him

45:36.060 --> 45:38.020
if he so desires.

45:38.020 --> 45:38.853
Right, Teddy?

45:41.870 --> 45:43.960
- Surely, yes ma'am.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.273
- All right, Teddy, let's get into things.

45:48.010 --> 45:51.170
So I pulled you over
for a traffic infraction

45:51.170 --> 45:56.170
and I found dismembered
body parts in your vehicle.

45:56.230 --> 45:58.120
Are you denying that?

45:58.120 --> 45:59.690
- No denial.

45:59.690 --> 46:01.183
It's just my work.

46:02.650 --> 46:04.960
I've been on the road for years

46:04.960 --> 46:07.033
all over the Midwest States.

46:07.920 --> 46:12.280
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,

46:12.280 --> 46:14.900
Ohio, here in Kentucky,

46:14.900 --> 46:16.210
just killing folks.

46:16.210 --> 46:19.260
Killed so many I barely
remember their faces.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.590
- So are you trying to tell me that

46:22.530 --> 46:24.899
you're a mass murderer?

46:24.899 --> 46:28.650
- Well, if that's what
you wanna call it, yes.

46:28.650 --> 46:30.153
This is my calling in life.

46:31.691 --> 46:33.550
(tense music)

46:33.550 --> 46:36.790
- Do you think that
you're the infamous killer

46:36.790 --> 46:40.860
that the media has dubbed
"The Great White Ripper"?

46:40.860 --> 46:42.460
Is that what you're telling me?

46:42.460 --> 46:43.640
I mean the one whose favorite way

46:43.640 --> 46:48.160
is to use shark teeth to rip
people's faces off and stuff?

46:48.160 --> 46:49.710
Is that what you're telling me?

46:50.640 --> 46:53.163
- These fries are rubbery.

46:54.330 --> 46:56.093
They are too cold and chewy for my taste.

46:57.450 --> 47:01.770
But yes, that's exactly
how I kill someone.

47:01.770 --> 47:04.910
I am the shark, the predator.

47:04.910 --> 47:07.663
I am one with the Great
White Goddess Chichimatul.

47:09.710 --> 47:10.803
- I see.

47:12.990 --> 47:14.240
So how long have you been out there

47:14.240 --> 47:15.710
killing innocent people, Teddy?

47:15.710 --> 47:20.109
- Oh, not innocents, no one is innocent.

47:20.109 --> 47:25.109
For they all fall short of
reaching their true potential.

47:26.132 --> 47:29.740
They're not evolved in
any way, shape or form.

47:29.740 --> 47:32.860
The new Chichimatul order is coming.

47:32.860 --> 47:35.020
I kill for sacrifices.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.410
They are martyrs.

47:36.410 --> 47:41.410
Their blood will initiate a
new establishment of society.

47:45.260 --> 47:48.307
- And so this Chichimatul, as you call it,

47:50.080 --> 47:51.333
is this your god?

47:52.490 --> 47:53.740
- Goddess.

47:53.740 --> 47:57.230
Great white shark goddess.

47:57.230 --> 48:01.760
There is no higher aspiration
than to be one with her.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.950
To usher in her bidding of a new species

48:04.950 --> 48:06.673
of shark humanoids.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.550
A loftier, perfect new race

48:10.550 --> 48:11.943
that will rule the world.

48:13.100 --> 48:16.820
Great Whites are focused,
higher end predators.

48:16.820 --> 48:18.000
They never lose.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.830
A 25 foot torpedo shooting
through the sea like bullets!

48:22.830 --> 48:25.070
Afraid of nothing, propelling themselves

48:25.070 --> 48:28.190
completely out of the
water when necessary.

48:28.190 --> 48:31.813
Air demons, no bounds, no mercy.

48:32.800 --> 48:36.553
And their mouths are lined with up to 300

48:37.930 --> 48:41.150
serrated, triangular teeth.

48:41.150 --> 48:43.390
And they have an
exceptional sense of smell

48:43.390 --> 48:45.280
to detect prey.

48:45.280 --> 48:50.280
As we will become
sharkanoids from the deep.

48:52.150 --> 48:55.250
They even have organs to sense the tiny

48:55.250 --> 48:59.180
electromagnetic fields generated by prey,

48:59.180 --> 49:02.800
and the higher alien
calling of transformation

49:02.800 --> 49:05.083
pulsating from Stonehenge.

49:06.210 --> 49:09.933
Everything is falling
into place as we speak.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.563
We give the world nightmares as it sleeps.

49:17.802 --> 49:21.100
- (sighing) Teddy, you're really starting

49:21.100 --> 49:23.150
to give me a headache
with all this gibberish

49:23.150 --> 49:25.343
that you're just spewing out here.

49:26.370 --> 49:29.870
How many people have you
killed out there on the road?

49:29.870 --> 49:31.670
- Oh, I have no clue.

49:31.670 --> 49:33.870
Endless, hundreds, it's simply part

49:33.870 --> 49:36.270
of my process, these sacrifices.

49:36.270 --> 49:39.190
The Stonehenge signals tell me what to do,

49:39.190 --> 49:42.490
which is why I allowed
myself to be caught.

49:42.490 --> 49:43.673
Things are wrapping up.

49:45.270 --> 49:47.468
- Stonehenge signals?

49:47.468 --> 49:50.963
(chuckling) Like voices
in your head, maybe?

49:52.690 --> 49:56.330
- Pulsing sensations
that mystically guide me.

49:56.330 --> 49:58.710
And I'm not the only one, you know.

49:58.710 --> 50:01.780
There are hundreds more
like me out on the road.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.630
All members of the shark cult
on their way to becoming.

50:05.630 --> 50:08.170
We're not even afraid of the devil, ma'am.

50:09.220 --> 50:10.443
He fears us.

50:11.479 --> 50:13.423
For we have teeth and we bite.

50:17.354 --> 50:21.229
- So (chuckling) do you happen
to believe in Bigfoot too?

50:21.229 --> 50:22.530
- Huh?

50:22.530 --> 50:23.363
- Never mind.

50:24.449 --> 50:27.366
(sighing) Nothing.

50:28.420 --> 50:31.263
Teddy, when we first met,

50:32.440 --> 50:33.983
you said I looked familiar.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.763
Do you know this girl?

50:41.370 --> 50:42.510
She's missing.

50:43.809 --> 50:46.623
And we found some of her
blood in the motel room.

50:49.307 --> 50:52.517
- My, my, she looks a lot like you.

50:56.600 --> 50:58.490
I couldn't be sure, but yeah,

50:58.490 --> 50:59.693
I probably offed her.

51:00.770 --> 51:03.663
So many, it's all just a blur of gray.

51:05.350 --> 51:06.863
Like a dead end job, you know?

51:08.200 --> 51:10.573
My reward is in the becoming.

51:14.230 --> 51:15.980
- [Chief] All right, Teddy.

51:15.980 --> 51:17.520
Where are all the bodies buried

51:17.520 --> 51:18.843
of those that you killed?

51:20.370 --> 51:21.400
- I'm not sure.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.151
It's not like there's
an address or anything.

51:24.151 --> 51:26.543
For me, it's just this one cornfield.

51:28.630 --> 51:30.853
I could take you there though, show you.

51:32.540 --> 51:34.610
Once I feel the winding roads,

51:34.610 --> 51:36.780
I know how to get there.

51:36.780 --> 51:38.330
I could ride there blindfolded.

51:40.250 --> 51:41.560
- All right.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.930
Well how about you and
me take a little ride

51:43.930 --> 51:45.233
and you take me there?

51:59.298 --> 52:02.215
(Benchley sighing)

52:04.881 --> 52:05.714
- Come on.

52:11.694 --> 52:12.527
Ugh!

52:16.964 --> 52:21.164
No! (sighing)

52:23.355 --> 52:25.390
Piece of shit hole.

52:27.676 --> 52:28.509
Fuck you.

52:30.950 --> 52:31.800
Nature walk.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.216
- See if it's here.

52:38.216 --> 52:40.130
Maybe it's over there.

52:40.130 --> 52:42.620
- Come on, I came as soon as I found out.

52:42.620 --> 52:43.600
- I bet you did.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.433
I bet you were the one phone call

52:44.433 --> 52:46.000
of your brother Gary.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.060
- I can't believe you're
still holding him.

52:48.060 --> 52:49.410
- Who else am I gonna hold?

52:49.410 --> 52:52.140
He's suspect number one,
and then there's you.

52:52.140 --> 52:53.047
- Me?

52:53.047 --> 52:54.260
Are you out of your mind?

52:54.260 --> 52:55.560
I was in Lexington.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.480
You can check.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.970
And besides, you know Gary
couldn't do anything like that.

52:58.970 --> 53:00.420
It's crazy!

53:00.420 --> 53:01.950
- Well let's see here, what we got here,

53:01.950 --> 53:03.810
Mr. Bob Woodward himself,

53:03.810 --> 53:07.260
prize winning editor,
Pulitzer prize Corn Magazine.

53:07.260 --> 53:08.430
But I digress.

53:08.430 --> 53:10.260
Not exactly Rolling Stone.

53:10.260 --> 53:14.400
We got one dead luke blood
local holly here, Susan Blake.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.390
And we got your brother
Gary running around

53:16.390 --> 53:17.600
in the corn fields.

53:17.600 --> 53:20.040
Lots of boozing going on and schmoozing.

53:20.040 --> 53:20.873
Let me ask you a question,

53:20.873 --> 53:22.760
who do you think did it, freaking Bigfoot?

53:22.760 --> 53:25.360
Maybe it was the Bigfoot
in your TV commercial,

53:25.360 --> 53:27.020
the one where brother
Gary is running around

53:27.020 --> 53:28.070
playing the Sasquatch.

53:28.070 --> 53:30.420
- Come on man, quit drinking the Kool Aid.

53:30.420 --> 53:31.760
That doesn't make any sense.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.550
It's bad PR.

53:33.550 --> 53:37.040
- Bad PR, good PR,
Bigfoot, you don't care.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.500
Gossip, anything is good

53:38.500 --> 53:40.910
for your own real estate
ventures and publicity.

53:40.910 --> 53:42.310
Well, you know what Gottlieb,

53:42.310 --> 53:43.740
nobody likes you in this town

53:43.740 --> 53:45.350
let alone Mayor Zanuck or me.

53:45.350 --> 53:48.220
We don't like the fact that
you came from money, right,

53:48.220 --> 53:50.090
and we had to bust our asses

53:50.090 --> 53:52.470
and make a living
through farming and corn.

53:52.470 --> 53:54.540
You run around with your newspaper,

53:54.540 --> 53:57.510
all your real estate
listings and run this town

53:57.510 --> 53:58.914
airing everybody's dirty laundry

53:58.914 --> 54:01.140
and publicizing it in your newspaper.

54:01.140 --> 54:02.420
Hell, you put the stuff in there

54:02.420 --> 54:03.650
about me and my mistress.

54:03.650 --> 54:05.225
I didn't appreciate that.

54:05.225 --> 54:06.300
That caused me a lot of pain.

54:06.300 --> 54:08.520
I almost lost this job.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.363
So don't expect any sympathy
from me, Mr. Money Bags.

54:12.810 --> 54:13.840
- Look.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.063
I have something that you need to see.

54:22.566 --> 54:24.730
I was videoing some
properties with my drone

54:24.730 --> 54:26.450
for my real estate videos.

54:26.450 --> 54:29.200
And I recorded this.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.300
For the second time.

54:31.300 --> 54:32.450
First time I thought I was,

54:32.450 --> 54:35.520
I don't know, hallucinating
or seeing things, but this.

54:35.520 --> 54:38.290
- You expect me to believe there's sharks

54:38.290 --> 54:39.780
in the cornfields?

54:39.780 --> 54:42.450
- You can see it with your own eyes!

54:42.450 --> 54:44.550
Kramer, we have got to tell Mayor Zanuck

54:44.550 --> 54:47.180
to close down all the corn
fields in Druid Hills!

54:47.180 --> 54:49.200
And then we gotta try and
figure out what's going on.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.220
I've done a little research

54:50.220 --> 54:52.450
and turns out there's a shark cult that,

54:52.450 --> 54:53.940
- I had enough of this malarkey.

54:53.940 --> 54:56.120
I want you out of this office right now!

54:56.120 --> 54:58.850
That looks like there's some
clouds in the sky going by

54:58.850 --> 55:01.310
or some crazy false computer imagery.

55:01.310 --> 55:05.380
You'd do anything to get
publicity for your newspaper.

55:05.380 --> 55:07.930
- Listen to yourself,
Kramer, it makes no sense.

55:07.930 --> 55:09.380
I came as soon as my brother called

55:09.380 --> 55:11.400
I wouldn't have time to
do anything like that.

55:11.400 --> 55:14.000
- Well, furthermore, this
is the best corn harvest

55:14.000 --> 55:15.530
we've had in years.

55:15.530 --> 55:17.040
Weather's been perfect,

55:17.040 --> 55:18.590
everything's been going well.

55:18.590 --> 55:20.900
And if you expect to
come out with one peep

55:20.900 --> 55:23.180
about something as stupid as farmers

55:23.180 --> 55:25.500
and the cornfields, and sharks out there,

55:25.500 --> 55:27.100
I'm gonna have you out of here

55:27.100 --> 55:28.700
for fake news propaganda.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.770
Why don't you put
something in your newspaper

55:30.770 --> 55:32.580
about you and your brother Gary

55:32.580 --> 55:34.370
being indicted for murder?

55:34.370 --> 55:36.060
- Fine, just fine.

55:36.060 --> 55:38.800
Kramer, as ludicrous as it sounds,

55:38.800 --> 55:39.960
those are sharks.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.710
And I know what a shark looks like

55:41.710 --> 55:44.860
'cause I keep seeing
them in the cornfields!

55:44.860 --> 55:47.260
Now I've researched what I think this is,

55:47.260 --> 55:48.570
and I'm pretty good at my job.

55:48.570 --> 55:50.690
So you had better do something about this

55:50.690 --> 55:52.610
or you won't have to
worry about getting sued

55:52.610 --> 55:53.530
or being ruined

55:53.530 --> 55:55.400
if this turns out to
be what I think it is,

55:55.400 --> 55:57.633
because there won't be anybody left!

55:57.633 --> 55:58.870
- I don't see anything in there.

55:58.870 --> 56:00.453
I think he's crazy.

56:04.848 --> 56:07.431
(serene music)

56:45.313 --> 56:47.813
(tense music)

56:56.380 --> 56:58.463
- So Chief, you about ready?

57:00.280 --> 57:02.213
- I guess as ready as I'll ever be.

57:05.150 --> 57:06.550
- Well, I could go with you.

57:07.615 --> 57:09.437
You know, I'm not opposed to that.

57:09.437 --> 57:11.170
- Oh, I appreciate that, Sam.

57:11.170 --> 57:12.780
But I really need somebody here

57:12.780 --> 57:14.260
with a good head on their shoulders

57:14.260 --> 57:16.550
to keep a watch out on the office

57:16.550 --> 57:19.270
and make sure everything runs smoothly.

57:19.270 --> 57:22.193
And in case I don't make it back.

57:22.193 --> 57:23.920
- Thanks, but don't talk like that.

57:23.920 --> 57:24.873
You're gonna be fine.

57:24.873 --> 57:27.360
- This is not really on the up and up.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.490
I mean I really should have given

57:28.490 --> 57:29.650
all the information that I have

57:29.650 --> 57:31.643
to the State Police, the FBI.

57:33.510 --> 57:38.060
But also, on a good note,

57:38.060 --> 57:39.570
this may put me on a map

57:39.570 --> 57:42.240
for bigger and better things.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.253
And most importantly,

57:46.110 --> 57:48.080
to find out if Teddy killed Lorna.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.865
- Oh I know, it's personal.

57:49.865 --> 57:51.253
And since you're gonna do it this way,

57:51.253 --> 57:52.626
I brought you this.

57:52.626 --> 57:54.380
- What's this?

57:54.380 --> 57:58.340
- This is something we got
from a peaceful protest

57:58.340 --> 58:00.280
a couple of weeks ago.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.490
I think there's plenty of weapons in there

58:02.490 --> 58:04.170
that you might find useful.

58:04.170 --> 58:05.040
If you do have to use it

58:05.040 --> 58:08.547
I know you'll put each thing to good use.

58:08.547 --> 58:11.214
(ominous music)

58:20.678 --> 58:24.066
You'll feel much safer with that.

58:24.066 --> 58:24.899
Cest la vie.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.060
- Thank you, Sam.

58:31.060 --> 58:32.083
I appreciate that.

58:34.681 --> 58:35.514
- Yippee.

58:35.514 --> 58:36.622
- Gonna beat it.
(door knocking)

58:36.622 --> 58:39.184
- [Woman] Your prisoner's ready, Chief.

58:39.184 --> 58:40.517
Get on in there!

58:41.762 --> 58:44.563
- All right, he's all yours.

58:44.563 --> 58:45.435
- All right.

58:45.435 --> 58:46.557
- All right, Chief,
I'll be on the dispatch

58:46.557 --> 58:48.303
for the next 44 hours, so.

58:49.501 --> 58:50.501
- All right.

58:56.502 --> 58:59.273
(light music)

58:59.273 --> 59:01.940
(phone beeping)

59:07.714 --> 59:10.937
- Are you wired into the GPS
that Benchley's carrying?

59:10.937 --> 59:12.520
- Yes I am.

59:12.520 --> 59:13.817
Got the little varmint.

59:13.817 --> 59:14.880
- Got the varmint!

59:14.880 --> 59:15.730
- Let's go.

59:15.730 --> 59:16.563
- Let's go!

59:34.480 --> 59:36.202
- To the helicopter.

59:36.202 --> 59:37.869
- To the helicopter.

59:42.866 --> 59:45.616
(rotor whirring)

01:00:00.903 --> 01:00:03.653
(wind whooshing)

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:21.371
(chill music)

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.993
- Good throw, you're learning.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.250
- Ray Aubergash, you're
gonna get Billy sunburned

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.452
if you keep him out here much longer!

01:00:31.452 --> 01:00:32.285
- Oh no!

01:00:36.624 --> 01:00:39.085
- Oh, that was a good one.

01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:40.870
Lighten up, Barbara.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.239
Trying to have a little
father son time here.

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:45.630
It's not like we can do this every day.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:46.990
- I know, I know.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:48.300
You just have to watch it.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.140
I mean, there's no ozone left,

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.020
all the ultraviolet rays.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.480
You have to watch it when they're young,

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.810
you know that already, okay?

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:57.203
- What is wrong with her?

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.135
- Did you put sunscreen on him?

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:01.323
- Oh, mom.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.490
- All right, you got 10 more minutes

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:05.370
and then we gotta go

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.960
'cause Grandma's making
cowboy cornbread casserole.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.450
- Not that garbage disposal junk again!

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.260
Last time we threw it
straight in the garbage,

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.043
what'd you think we're gonna
do with it this time, eat it?

01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:22.946
(corn rustling)

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.341
- [Billy] Oh, I'm kind of scared

01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:26.767
of all the snakes back there.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:29.263
- Oh, ain't no snakes in the corn.

01:01:29.263 --> 01:01:30.613
Here you go.

01:01:30.613 --> 01:01:31.446
Ah!

01:01:33.453 --> 01:01:34.670
- [Billy] Gosh.

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:35.503
That's it.

01:01:35.503 --> 01:01:36.352
- [Ray] Well, you'll be all right.

01:01:36.352 --> 01:01:38.546
You go and get it.

01:01:38.546 --> 01:01:41.296
(shark growling)

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:02.952
Sorry.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.952
Sorry I threw it back in there so...

01:02:07.388 --> 01:02:12.388
Shark! (screaming)

01:02:12.403 --> 01:02:13.236
- No!

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.217
(sobbing)

01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:23.884
(ominous music)

01:02:24.956 --> 01:02:28.123
(zapping and buzzing)

01:02:34.575 --> 01:02:38.075
(light suspenseful music)

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:39.820
- You better hope you're being
straight with me, Teddy bear.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.360
'Cause if you're not,

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.770
you and me are gonna have some problems.

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.563
- Straight as a roundabout, ma'am.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.050
- Now what does that mean?

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:54.050
- It means everything is
about to come full circle.

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:57.780
The fullest blood moon prophecy will rise

01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.363
on the appropriate night.

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:02.170
Maybe this one.

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.770
And the cosmic revelations

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.170
and forces of Stonehenge
(thunder rumbling)

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.970
will be fully empowered.

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:10.603
That's why I had to
keep my shark tooth on.

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.170
I don't wanna miss being transformed.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:16.810
- So wait, you're saying Stonehenge

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.890
gives off some sort of signal

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.973
to your shark goddess Chichimatul?

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:28.060
A real Great White Shark
you and your cult worship?

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.060
- Yes.

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.590
The signal will be received

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:33.310
by her electromagnetic sensitivity.

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:35.350
Not only used for prey

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.200
but for intuitive commands like this,

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.690
when the becoming is to begin.

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.710
We have members that have
been keeping track of her,

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:47.023
following her in the
Atlantic for decades now.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.900
All for the becoming.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.130
- [Chief] That's an
incredible belief, Teddy bear.

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:56.223
I mean, it is a little farfetched though.

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.460
- Mock it if you will, cop.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.863
I already have electroreception.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:08.170
I can smell your fear, like sweat

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:12.118
and,
(music intensifying)

01:05:12.118 --> 01:05:15.868
(music stops)
something else.

01:05:37.677 --> 01:05:40.177
(eerie music)

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:01.850
- Won't be long now, boss.

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.400
We'll be coming up on him fast.

01:06:05.466 --> 01:06:08.414
- Technology makes me hard.

01:06:08.414 --> 01:06:09.696
- Hard.

01:06:09.696 --> 01:06:11.112
(Boss laughing)

01:06:11.112 --> 01:06:13.779
(both laughing)

01:06:24.036 --> 01:06:26.660
(gloomy music)

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.580
- Geez, not much left
of old Billy in there

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.803
but lots of blood on the corn stalks.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.500
- Jesus Christ, what in
the name of Randy Travis

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.970
is going on around here, Kramer?

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.027
- Well, Mr. Mayor, they say-

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.530
- They, they, (blubbering),

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:40.930
spit it out already!

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.500
- They said it was a shark attack.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.630
They said that Billy went
in to get his frisbee

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:47.043
and shoom, shark ate him right up.

01:06:48.273 --> 01:06:49.290
- A shark attack?

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.210
Who said that, some damn crackhead?

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:53.070
Somebody snorting airplane glue?

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.450
Mushroom eaters?

01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:55.710
Shit!

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.400
- I've known the Aubergashes for years.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.970
They're straight and narrow, churchgoers,

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:01.230
white bread eaters.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.560
Honey the extra fiber with every meal.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.330
We had a similar incident, Mr. Mayor,

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:06.720
about a week or so ago

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.110
in those yonder fields maybe a mile away.

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.940
Gary Gottlieb and Susan Blake,

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.900
same kind of thing happened to them.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.170
- Which means Gary should
be freed, gentlemen.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:16.750
You had him locked up when this happened.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:17.990
So can we spring my brother now?

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.730
- Oh Jesus, I need this

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:22.460
like a damn Billy Goat pecker
going on top of my head.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.150
What the hell are you
doing here, Gottlieb?

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.727
- Well Mr. Mayor, I'm the
news, the people around here,

01:07:26.727 --> 01:07:28.367
and so I'm here in my official capacity

01:07:28.367 --> 01:07:29.230
with the Corn Gazette.

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.310
As well as having a personal
stake in this matter!

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:34.200
- So Mr. News Man, what's
your big take on all this?

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.600
Who's behind these gruesome murders?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.777
Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster, the boogeyman?

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.544
- Well, all right,
generally the Bigfoot thing

01:07:41.544 --> 01:07:43.220
is just more of an advertising conjecture

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.140
to help me sell farms, you know.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.370
- As in one big fat country fib.

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:49.004
- So in fancy schmancy talk,

01:07:49.004 --> 01:07:50.560
it's just a bunch of bulldog gravy

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.863
with no damn bacon on it.

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:55.460
- Well, look, did I say I saw Bigfoot, no.

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.560
But people around here
say they saw Bigfoot.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.910
Are they making it up, I don't know.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:59.847
But I didn't make that up.

01:07:59.847 --> 01:08:02.500
You know, I always worry I
would run into Bigfoot out here

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.440
and then I'd have a lot
of explaining to do.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.030
Now, I've been looking into it

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.240
since I started seeing
sharks in the cornfield

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.403
with my drones I film my
real estate videos with.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.890
Take a look at this, Mr. Mayor.

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:17.920
- I don't believe this shit.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.569
- As you can see, there are
sharks in the cornfields.

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:25.380
Now, I've done some deep
dive research on this.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.580
And these fields, all these fields

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.830
are on an ancient burial ground.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.790
And there's this shark cult

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:35.000
that worships a humanoid shark goddess.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.840
And they believe she's about to return.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.200
And when she does, they'll
be transformed into hybrids,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.359
changed into shark people.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.880
- I feel like you'd have to
go with Bigfoot, Gottlieb!

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.710
This shit's ridiculous!

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:48.330
All I see is a bunch of clouds,

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:49.740
weird figures up in the clouds.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.559
Hell, people see weird stuff
like that in the clouds

01:08:51.559 --> 01:08:52.540
all the time!

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.279
My grandma saw the devil jumping rope

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.430
one time in the clouds!

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.029
- You all have your heads in the clouds!

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:06.990
Even with the video evidence
right in front of you

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:08.689
you won't believe.

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.290
Listen.

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:13.493
I know it sounds completely insane.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.080
But lives have been lost,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.200
including a little boy's,
directly in front of you.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.729
Now this situation is only
going to get worse and worse

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:24.660
as the energy source in that cornfield

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.183
gets stronger and stronger.

01:09:27.389 --> 01:09:31.210
Soon, those corn sharks will
be able to get out of the field

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.779
and there's no telling
what they'll be able to do

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.000
when they get loose.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.620
Now I think that there are
fields all over the place.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.870
Maybe all over the world.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.450
- Jonathan, why don't you
go back to your office

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.710
with that corn cob pipe,
put some hash in it

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.630
and toke on a little bit harder?

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:47.330
- Something crazy is going on here

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.670
and you better do something about it

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:49.760
before it swims up

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.479
and bites you in the cornhole!

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.309
Now can we please close
down these corn fields

01:09:54.309 --> 01:09:55.920
and try and get a handle on this?!

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.110
- Can't you see, you idiot?

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.420
It's harvest season, and a damn good one!

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.070
People out here, that's
how they make a living,

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.090
it's off selling the corn!

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:04.440
I'm not going to shut the cornfield down,

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.280
that's just ludicrous!

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.540
Now, if you think there's
some kind of Bigfoot

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.150
or monster out here injuring people,

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:12.147
like they did to those poor people,

01:10:12.147 --> 01:10:14.770
the little redneck boy,
and all these farmers,

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:16.230
you and your boys should go catch them,

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.570
take them down, get them outta here.

01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:19.700
Jeez!

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.000
- Look, this is way bigger
than any of us can fathom,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:23.833
do you hear?

01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:25.293
- [Woman On Radio] Base to Rosenberg.

01:10:27.639 --> 01:10:28.643
- Go with base.

01:10:31.153 --> 01:10:33.120
- [Woman On Radio] Just
got a report from Eleanor

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.639
at the Williams farm.

01:10:34.639 --> 01:10:36.580
She said that the boys and some friends

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.877
that have stumbled into the cornfield

01:10:37.877 --> 01:10:39.940
and there were some tracks or something.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.230
They're all shook up and
they ain't making much sense.

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.580
They say there's a lot
of blood and body parts

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.050
and well, they're afraid to
go into the field, because-

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.073
- Because why?

01:10:51.923 --> 01:10:52.857
- [Woman On Radio] Well this sounds crazy,

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:56.230
but because of sharks in the cornfield.

01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:58.020
They say they can see the fins

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.112
and they appear to be about
eight to 10 foot Great Whites.

01:11:02.809 --> 01:11:05.110
- Never go swimming with bowlegged women.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.780
You boys and girls get
your asses over there

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.237
and see what the hell's going on.

01:11:08.237 --> 01:11:10.070
And if it's what they say it is,

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:11.573
you nail them damn fish!

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:15.362
Or...

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.376
We close the damn corn fields.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:20.627
- But Mr. Mayor!

01:11:20.627 --> 01:11:22.070
- You listen to me, you dumb dick,

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:23.730
for the first time in your life!

01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.780
This is election year.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.357
We got to at least make some
kind of a half ass effort

01:11:26.357 --> 01:11:28.070
to act like we care.

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.903
You got me?

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.362
Now, you go do what you need to do

01:11:32.362 --> 01:11:34.170
and get the hell outta here.

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:38.889
No, no, no, where you think
you're going, Lois Lane?

01:11:38.889 --> 01:11:42.012
Ace reporter, we're gonna
have a chat, you and I.

01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:44.188
- It's not like going down to the pond

01:11:44.188 --> 01:11:46.540
chasing bass and crappies,
is it, Mr. Mayor.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.820
- Well, that's why me and you,

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.630
we're gonna walk the perimeter.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:51.410
I wanna ring the damn dinner bell myself,

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:54.050
see if anything popped
up to get a little snack.

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:55.490
- I think I have some things in my car

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:56.710
that might help us.

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.110
- Well, let's go do it, man.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.920
- Hey.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.853
You need a ride?

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:20.684
- No, no thanks.

01:12:20.684 --> 01:12:21.517
I'm good.

01:12:21.517 --> 01:12:22.350
- Are you sure?

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:24.150
I mean, it's starting to rain outside.

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:25.639
You look a little bit frazzled.

01:12:25.639 --> 01:12:27.690
We're gonna head up to Druid Hills.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:28.920
I don't mind giving you a ride,

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.460
or do you want me to call
somebody for you or something?

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.342
- All right.

01:12:32.342 --> 01:12:33.561
You talked me into it.

01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:34.511
I'll go up to your.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:48.670
I know you're a cop and all

01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:51.483
but didn't your mom teach
you not to pick up strangers?

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.070
- You know, to be a good cop,

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.070
you've gotta have good instincts, right?

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.510
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.800
Yeah, no worries.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.030
This back here, in the back seat,

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.850
this is Teddy Bo Lucas.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:14.880
Self-proclaimed serial
killer or something.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.540
So he says he's gonna
take me up to Druid Hills.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.360
There is supposedly a burial mound

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.840
where he's killed all these people.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.673
- Really?

01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:23.505
- Yeah.

01:13:23.505 --> 01:13:24.650
- I'm intrigued.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:25.573
- You should be.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.477
So what's your name?

01:13:28.477 --> 01:13:29.660
- Murray.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.050
Murray Benchley.

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:32.780
- Well nice to meet you, Murray.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.559
I'm Chief Scheider.

01:13:34.559 --> 01:13:37.123
Vera, from Chance, Kentucky.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.200
So where are you headed?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.950
- [Murray] Coincidentally, Druid Hills.

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:45.870
- All roads lead to Druid Hills, people.

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:49.380
- Hah, well that worked out
good for you, didn't it?

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.903
- [Murray] Yes, yes it did.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.423
- What you got in that briefcase?

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.223
- Paperwork, blueprints.

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.587
- Uh huh.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.763
Mr. Benchley.

01:14:19.559 --> 01:14:22.053
I can feel what you have in there.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.763
You believe in predestination?

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.362
- Not really.

01:14:32.286 --> 01:14:35.036
(Teddy laughing)

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:41.093
- You should, my friend, you should.

01:14:42.022 --> 01:14:44.700
Everything is falling into place.

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:47.173
Everything.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.032
- You two know each other?

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:53.543
- No.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.673
No.

01:15:00.928 --> 01:15:02.573
- We're closing in on Benchley.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.853
He's moving fast now.

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:09.223
It's almost like he's in a car.

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.850
- No worries.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.800
We're gonna sneak up on
him kinda unexpectedly

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:18.883
and then we're gonna
bite him in the balls.

01:15:18.883 --> 01:15:23.683
- Balls! (laughing)

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:31.990
- All right, Angelo won't be long now,

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.440
you got your gun locked and loaded?

01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:42.282
- Sir, I left my piece back at base.

01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:47.883
- What do I pay you for?

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:50.120
Have a handicap, they say,

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.943
he'll be fun to watch.

01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:55.693
Oh man, do I gotta do everything myself?

01:15:56.897 --> 01:15:59.246
You know, you can pick
some of that toe cheese out

01:15:59.246 --> 01:16:02.620
and we have some nasty ammunition

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.610
to throw at the bad guys.

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:05.623
- Bad guys.

01:16:07.723 --> 01:16:10.473
(rotor whirring)

01:16:11.362 --> 01:16:12.559
- Yeah there he is.

01:16:12.559 --> 01:16:16.402
We're gonna nail that guy
and destroy that shark pup.

01:16:16.402 --> 01:16:17.985
- Destroy that pup!

01:16:24.237 --> 01:16:25.760
(tense music)

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.860
- [Rosenberg] I see somebody in there

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.123
but I don't think they're coming.

01:16:29.123 --> 01:16:31.563
- Yeah, they're moving around there.

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:33.900
I think they're terrified.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.300
See, they just ran into the other room.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.790
- [Rosenberg] Aw hell,
we're on our own, I guess.

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:40.910
- Yeah, anyway let's go
check out that cornfield.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:41.743
- All right.

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:53.150
- Looks harmless, why
don't you go in there

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.550
and take a look around?

01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:56.200
- Ha, no sir, not without you.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.100
- Get on in there and let's see

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.450
if we could find those bodies.

01:16:58.450 --> 01:16:59.437
The mayor wants to know about this

01:16:59.437 --> 01:17:01.880
and we gotta get back to him right away.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.860
Yeah, we're gonna go in
there and take a look around.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.350
If we see anything, we'll
just shoot 'em with our gun.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.780
- I don't think that's gonna work.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.900
- Get in there a little bit closer.

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.106
Go on, come on now, come on.

01:17:11.106 --> 01:17:12.690
- You go.
- Come on, come on.

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:13.523
Ladies first.
- No way.

01:17:13.523 --> 01:17:15.650
- Get on in there deep, Rosenberg,

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:16.820
let's take a look around.

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.380
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.130
- Well, if there's bodies in there,

01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:21.030
we gotta find them.

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:22.430
We gotta clean this place up

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.722
and see what's going on here.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:24.803
- Man, what the hell is the rush, man?

01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:27.940
- Well, you did this all in training.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.820
We took that course for 12 hours,

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.468
I taught you all this stuff,
you should know better.

01:17:31.468 --> 01:17:32.300
- Shh!

01:17:34.035 --> 01:17:37.080
I thought I heard something.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.813
Oh shit, I thought I saw...

01:17:41.813 --> 01:17:44.240
A fin, or a reflection or something!

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.590
- Saw what?

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:48.173
- Oh, shit, I don't think
we're in here alone.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.653
- Come on, now.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.700
(music intensifying)

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.219
(corn rustling)

01:17:56.219 --> 01:17:58.594
(shark roaring)

01:17:58.594 --> 01:18:00.289
- Oh, my shit!

01:18:00.289 --> 01:18:01.121
Oh, shit!

01:18:03.294 --> 01:18:05.794
(chill music)

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:12.330
- Everything is coming
together exactly as planned.

01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:15.093
I can feel it in my bones.

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:18.050
What about you, Chief?

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:22.123
You feeling that
excitement buzz? (buzzing)

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.653
- [Chief] Teddy, this
is just all so weird!

01:18:32.072 --> 01:18:34.322
- [Grossman] Base to Chief.

01:18:35.356 --> 01:18:37.550
- Go ahead, Grossman.

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.751
- (crunching) How are
you making out, Chief?

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.100
- We're doing okay, we're almost there.

01:18:45.415 --> 01:18:47.830
- (crunching) You be
careful out there, Chief.

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.660
We're getting some odd
and disturbing reports

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:51.843
from Druid Hills.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.593
- Wait, what kind of reports?

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.900
- Well to be quite honest,

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.452
we're getting some
attack reports on people.

01:19:06.614 --> 01:19:08.797
People are being attacked in Druid Hills,

01:19:08.797 --> 01:19:13.050
in cornfields, by sharks.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.513
- [Chief] Shark attacks?

01:19:18.832 --> 01:19:19.793
Okay.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.914
Thanks for the heads up.

01:19:22.914 --> 01:19:24.014
- Over and out, Chief.

01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:39.594
(crunching)

01:19:44.549 --> 01:19:46.914
Sharks in the popcorn!

01:19:46.914 --> 01:19:47.831
Doggone it!

01:19:49.349 --> 01:19:51.410
(shark clacking)

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:52.633
Sharks everywhere.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.513
Wow.

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:06.243
Chief?

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:13.125
Ah, more coffee.

01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:22.577
(chill music)

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.730
- So what do you think?

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:28.973
You still going to head
to Druid Hills with me?

01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:33.593
- Well, Chief, I got a confession.

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:36.443
Actually,

01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:40.800
I'm with the CIA.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.330
I'm an agent.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.523
Been investigating this shark
cult for many months now.

01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:49.660
Initially it was just
investigative and speculative

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.452
but now with Teddy and all these murders,

01:20:54.407 --> 01:20:56.620
(sighing) we're taking it more serious.

01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.910
First we thought the mafia was involved

01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:00.690
but it turns out that

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.680
we think they just knew
something really bad was comin'.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.930
So as of now I'm not sure
what the hell is going on.

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:11.710
But it's officially been upgraded from

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.889
some crackpot niche group

01:21:13.889 --> 01:21:16.170
to an actual terrorism threat

01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:17.780
against the United States.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.680
- You got that right, sucker.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.090
It's going down right now.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.487
You're going down too.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.993
- I knew there was something about you.

01:21:27.993 --> 01:21:29.823
Just an intuition.

01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.610
- Good call.

01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:33.443
Smart cookie.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.239
- So what do you think?

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:39.043
Do you want to go in to
the eye of the storm?

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.383
- [Benchley] Fuckin' A.

01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:43.216
- Well let's go.

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:47.416
(eerie music)

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:01.860
(tense music)

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.610
- Jesus Christ, Captain Quint,

01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:05.389
where the hell did you get that thing?

01:22:05.389 --> 01:22:06.223
- Local pawn shop.

01:22:06.223 --> 01:22:08.150
Just got lucky, I guess.

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:08.983
You never know what you'll run into

01:22:08.983 --> 01:22:10.440
at the old hawk shops.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.500
- You better watch them pawn shops, boy.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.910
I know somebody who bought a
pair of panties there one time,

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.386
ended up with gonorrhea
and the damn herpes.

01:22:17.386 --> 01:22:18.389
- What?

01:22:18.389 --> 01:22:19.386
- Yeah.

01:22:19.386 --> 01:22:20.930
Don't know about them
rubbers there either.

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:23.160
I just read about the Chinese.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.710
They're taking used rubbers,

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:26.559
cleaning them out and reselling them.

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:29.450
- Damn, that's some nasty shit.

01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:30.397
- Yeah.

01:22:30.397 --> 01:22:33.050
- I was hoping my order
would get here anytime

01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.867
before we actually went into these stalks.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.230
- Order, what the hell
are you talking about?

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:37.782
What'd you order, a pizza?

01:22:37.782 --> 01:22:38.616
- Well.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.670
- [Delivery Guy] Hey Jonathan.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.503
- Hey.
- Here's that package

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:47.581
that you ordered and

01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:49.650
you're a little bit out
on the farm than usual.

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:51.870
- Ah yeah, out fishing actually.

01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:53.377
Thank you, you guys rule.

01:22:53.377 --> 01:22:55.112
- [Delivery Guy] Well,
glad to be of service.

01:22:59.544 --> 01:23:00.707
- What the hell was that?

01:23:00.707 --> 01:23:02.900
- Ah, that's Amazing.com.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.160
They deliver, I belong
to the Pronto program

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.300
so I get packages in four hours,

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.650
and free streaming
movies right to my phone.

01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:11.404
- What are you, the damn
spokesperson for them or something?

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:13.056
(shark roaring)

01:23:13.056 --> 01:23:15.058
(man screaming)

01:23:15.058 --> 01:23:15.891
What the hell?

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:17.913
That old boy must have
hemorrhoids or something.

01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:20.807
- This guy has his last delivery today.

01:23:20.807 --> 01:23:23.170
- [Mayor] And what is
all these, flea collars?

01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.460
- They're shark-repellant bracelets,

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.860
like Off, but for sharks.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.340
They're designed to work underwater

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:29.139
where the sound travels
faster and further,

01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:31.770
but they should have some nominal effect

01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:33.210
in the open air.

01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:35.362
In close proximity at least, I hope.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.110
- I'll be dipped in shit.

01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:39.980
You can get anything from Amazing.com.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.809
Still, I ain't gonna wear one
of those things, you putz.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:44.360
It don't matter, there
ain't no sharks out here.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.270
Probably a wildcat, maybe a bear.

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:48.960
Hell, maybe your old friend Bigfoot

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.090
really is the one out here doing all this.

01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:52.880
- Well, this might repel
those predators too,

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.713
I don't know.

01:23:53.713 --> 01:23:56.723
- Well as long as you keep me
safe, Mr. Shark Hunter Boy.

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:01.050
- Ah, you know, if you come here

01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:03.590
it's gonna be at your own risk.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:04.920
- You sure you don't want some flippers

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.469
and a snorkel too, you dumbass?

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.340
- Well, at least you
won't need a bigger mouth

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.889
if you start screaming in there.

01:24:10.889 --> 01:24:12.309
You got that much going for ya.

01:24:12.309 --> 01:24:13.143
- Let's go.

01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:19.594
(lightly suspenseful music)

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:35.875
- Is he comin'?

01:24:35.875 --> 01:24:39.897
- Yeah.

01:24:39.897 --> 01:24:40.900
- [Benchley] Come on, Ted.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.032
- Come on now.

01:24:42.032 --> 01:24:43.532
You fucking freak.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.170
So is this where you buried my sister?

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.469
This is the burial mound
you're talking about?

01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:54.610
- Yes, ma'am, I believe it is.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.423
It's all coming back now.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.340
All the victims' blood will align

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.920
with the power of Stonehenge
(thunder rumbling)

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.040
and the crimson moon!

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.012
Chichimatul will become one

01:25:08.012 --> 01:25:09.723
with the shark goddess.

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.630
All those martyrs in the field

01:25:14.059 --> 01:25:17.280
will be reborn in the great becoming,

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.793
in her honor!

01:25:20.389 --> 01:25:23.963
- So this is where everything
lines up with Stonehenge?

01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:27.050
All right, we need to go in

01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:30.153
and destroy the sharks and the source.

01:25:31.637 --> 01:25:33.193
Do you have any more weapons?

01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:35.963
- Actually, I do.

01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:38.719
I've got a backpack back here

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:40.570
that Grossman gave me.

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:41.782
Hold on to this

01:25:41.782 --> 01:25:43.219
fucking freak.
- Got him.

01:25:43.219 --> 01:25:45.420
- And I think it has a
bunch of weapons in it.

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.423
Even a grenade.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.260
- A grenade?

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:54.530
Ah probably from some peaceful protesters.

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.100
Okay, I'm gonna need to borrow your phone.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.920
Time to call in the big guns.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.039
Things are about to get real.

01:26:01.039 --> 01:26:03.206
(bashing)

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:11.260
- Now, now, Chief.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:15.450
Knocking out a CIA
agent, a fellow comrade?

01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:19.943
I think you just overstepped
your jurisdiction. (laughing)

01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:31.584
(ominous music)

01:26:36.262 --> 01:26:37.179
- You know?

01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:42.540
All my life, I've been nothing to anybody.

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:46.793
I've always been nothing
but a fucking failure!

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.190
I've never been good for anybody.

01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:54.123
I've always been spit on
by family and friends.

01:26:55.795 --> 01:26:57.883
And I'm sick and tired of it.

01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:03.940
I'm so tired of just doing
things for everybody else

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.193
and nobody giving a fuck about me!

01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:12.505
So no, I'm gonna do this,

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.733
and I'm gonna do this for Lorna.

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:18.740
She needs to be reborn

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.003
and I'm not a failure anymore.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.490
So I wanna make sure that I merge

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.293
with the Great White Shark Cult.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.040
I now know

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.103
that wrong is right.

01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:38.202
And I wanna be with the
becoming of Chichimatul.

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.647
I didn't believe you at first, Teddy.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.833
I really was on the fence about it.

01:27:48.023 --> 01:27:49.263
But now I know.

01:27:51.362 --> 01:27:53.462
You were telling the truth the whole time.

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.850
And I'll do anything possible to make sure

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:59.112
that Lorna is reborn again.

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.809
- I knew it.

01:28:05.809 --> 01:28:07.540
This is perfect!

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:11.653
You were the one all along, Chief.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.910
I am honored and humbled.

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:16.323
As it has been written.

01:28:17.719 --> 01:28:19.875
- Let me get you out of these.

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:22.625
(Teddy laughing)

01:28:23.752 --> 01:28:27.170
- We need my shark jaws and
what's in Benchley's briefcase

01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:28.719
to complete the perfect circle.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:41.231
This is the 13th pup.

01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:44.853
The 13th pup from Chichimatul!

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.123
- You mean the Great White Shark's babies?

01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.993
- Exactly.

01:28:52.469 --> 01:28:54.770
The people watching over
her had been collecting

01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:56.763
her stillborns for decades.

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:01.210
I buried them here in the field

01:29:01.210 --> 01:29:03.170
with the other martyrs.

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:04.263
Like your sister.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.770
This is the last one
we need to lay to rest

01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:10.713
for the becoming.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.983
It's finally time!

01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:18.237
- Well let's do this, my friend.

01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:22.719
(tense music)

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:23.760
- So far so good.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.150
You doing okay, Mr. Mayor?

01:29:25.150 --> 01:29:27.553
- Oh, I'm just sitting in
butter back here myself.

01:29:28.628 --> 01:29:29.460
(corn rustling)

01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.413
Hey wait, do you hear that?

01:29:31.413 --> 01:29:32.246
I thought I heard a car.

01:29:32.246 --> 01:29:34.559
You think it may be Rosenberg and Kramer?

01:29:34.559 --> 01:29:37.688
- Maybe, but, they haven't
contacted us yet though.

01:29:37.688 --> 01:29:40.432
I don't know.

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:43.099
(corn rustling)

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.850
- Damn, what, what?

01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:47.293
You hear something, see something?

01:29:47.293 --> 01:29:49.769
- If I saw something, it was gray,

01:29:49.769 --> 01:29:52.309
something gray, it was like a flash.

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:53.790
- Well maybe your old buddy Bigfoot,

01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:55.690
he's wearing a gray sports jacket.

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:58.708
He's going to the Daytime
Emmy Awards or something.

01:29:58.708 --> 01:30:00.547
- At least they haven't attacked us yet.

01:30:02.807 --> 01:30:05.639
(Mayor screaming)

01:30:08.558 --> 01:30:11.225
(shark roaring)

01:30:16.804 --> 01:30:19.471
(corn rustling)

01:30:26.166 --> 01:30:28.833
(ominous music)

01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:36.626
(music intensifying)

01:30:36.626 --> 01:30:39.543
(bracelet beeping)

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:45.572
(corn rustling)

01:30:52.037 --> 01:30:55.860
(lightly tense music)

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:56.693
- Lorna?

01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:01.023
- I'm sorry.

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:03.969
But you are blessed.

01:31:03.969 --> 01:31:06.183
She's a martyr for Chichimatul now.

01:31:07.068 --> 01:31:10.623
- So she'll live again when
I become the shark goddess?

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:13.969
- Yes.

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:17.389
But like you said, you have
to want to do it for you.

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:18.307
- Oh, I do.

01:31:19.148 --> 01:31:21.620
I just want her to have a chance

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.813
to come back in the most purest of forms.

01:31:25.637 --> 01:31:30.087
- Yes. (hissing)

01:31:32.907 --> 01:31:35.407
(tense music)

01:31:45.973 --> 01:31:50.255
Yes. (hissing)

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:56.603
Feel the power.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.600
Feel the power of the blood
sacrifices I've made for you

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.743
with those shark jaws.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:07.771
Begin you calling.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.183
It's almost time.

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.490
Dress as the shark scarecrow,

01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:17.880
and when the blood moon rises tonight,

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.830
the Stonehenge energy will
give us the cosmic revelations

01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:21.707
we yearn for.

01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:24.710
The becoming will begin.

01:32:56.651 --> 01:32:59.318
(eerie hissing)

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.610
(ominous tone chiming)

01:33:28.325 --> 01:33:32.075
(rotor whirring in distance)

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:45.411
- Benchley is right there!

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:48.077
Somewhere down in the cornfield!

01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:17.398
(music intensifying)

01:34:17.398 --> 01:34:19.969
(corn rustling)

01:34:19.969 --> 01:34:21.219
- [Both] Shark!

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.440
(explosion booming)

01:34:31.558 --> 01:34:32.391
- Shark?

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.460
(solemn music)

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:51.993
- Did you see that?

01:34:51.993 --> 01:34:53.360
That helicopter!

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.918
The shark kicked it right out of the sky!

01:34:55.918 --> 01:34:57.583
Gave me a chance to get out of there.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.300
- Who are you?

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.040
- Oh, I'm one of the good guys, I think.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.309
Jonathan Gottlieb.

01:35:04.309 --> 01:35:07.190
I'm publisher of the
Druid Hills Corn Gazette.

01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:08.070
Me and Mayor Zanuck,

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:10.469
we went in there to investigate
the corn sharks and,

01:35:10.469 --> 01:35:11.303
they got him.

01:35:11.303 --> 01:35:12.960
- Corn sharks?

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.750
Okay look, I'm Murray Benchley,

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:16.743
I'm with the CIA.

01:35:17.598 --> 01:35:21.639
I was investigating this
with Chief Vera Scheider,

01:35:21.639 --> 01:35:23.630
but she hit me on the back of the head

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:25.320
and ran in there with one
of the cult murderers.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.153
- Traitor!

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.420
Well she's part of the problem now.

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.110
- So you're up to speed on everything?

01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:32.550
- Yes sir, I think so.

01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:35.160
If these lunatic shark
cultists have their way

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.490
it'll be the end of the
world as we know it.

01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:38.780
- No doubt.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.833
- So what do we do now?

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:42.980
- All right, look.

01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:45.889
It's gonna be dark soon.

01:35:45.889 --> 01:35:47.543
So I say we wait until cover of darkness.

01:35:47.543 --> 01:35:48.450
(intense drumming music)

01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.057
Then go in when they least expect it

01:35:50.057 --> 01:35:51.500
and take 'em out.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.660
- All right, I'm with you.

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:55.830
I've got shark repellant
bracelets from Amazing.com,

01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:57.873
harpoon gun from the pawnshop.

01:35:57.873 --> 01:36:00.110
- Well I got a bag full of girly toys

01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:03.026
that should make a lot of noise.

01:36:03.026 --> 01:36:03.904
- All right.

01:36:03.904 --> 01:36:05.731
Well let's not let this pie go stale.

01:36:05.731 --> 01:36:06.648
- No doubt.

01:36:16.057 --> 01:36:18.557
(eerie music)

01:36:26.994 --> 01:36:29.994
(low noise droning)

01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:47.958
(corn rustling)

01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:03.410
(suspenseful music)

01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:25.889
â™ª Show me the way to go home â™ª

01:37:25.889 --> 01:37:26.723
Ahh.

01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:30.809
Yeah we probably should see

01:37:30.809 --> 01:37:32.452
what is going on here.

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.570
- Tonight we come full circle.

01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:41.469
Everything is aligned for
Chichimatul and the becoming.

01:37:41.469 --> 01:37:45.090
The 666 martyrs have been served

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:47.263
and lie in this cornfield!

01:37:49.468 --> 01:37:52.135
(corn rustling)

01:37:57.136 --> 01:38:01.580
The blood of the shark
teeth has been ingested!

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.980
And we now live in the
prophetic revelations

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.973
as the blood moon rises.

01:38:09.639 --> 01:38:10.883
As it is written,

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.790
we have a mortal volunteer

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:17.193
to become one with Chichimatul.

01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:21.900
By the power of Stonehenge!
(thunder rumbling)

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.710
I pro offer, the final pup

01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:28.000
and Vera Scheider's willing soul,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.263
in your honor and glory,
almighty Chichimatul!

01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:36.118
(corn rustling)

01:38:38.165 --> 01:38:39.830
- Hmm.

01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:41.600
Sure is getting crowded in here.

01:38:43.146 --> 01:38:44.591
- Yeah.

01:38:44.591 --> 01:38:47.537
What happened to the Conan
virus and social distancing?

01:38:47.537 --> 01:38:49.983
I'm gonna tell Governor
Andy about this one.

01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:55.090
- Do we need a reason?

01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:58.350
Just look around at the state of humanity!

01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:03.350
Inferior, weak, sickly, frail,

01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:07.043
divided, hateful, afraid!

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.550
Truly the monsters, the
viruses of this age.

01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:14.160
Becoming one with Chichimatul

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.840
will absolve us of these shortcomings.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.202
We will all be part of the
same mindset in the becoming.

01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.770
Rulers of this planet,

01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:29.490
and eventually the universe.

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:31.563
I pro offer the 13th pup!

01:39:38.543 --> 01:39:40.876
(splashing)

01:39:43.168 --> 01:39:45.835
(corn rustling)

01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.660
The barriers are now unbound!

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.452
What was once impossible is now possible!

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:06.980
The festival of the Sanguinary is upon us!

01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:10.059
The last serious attempt
having taken place

01:40:10.059 --> 01:40:12.610
1300 years ago,

01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:15.210
when the earth ran red

01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:20.040
with blood sacrifices, famine, and war!

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.053
All hail to our craft!

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.223
- Witchcraft!

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.250
- Stonehenge and the moon
(thunder rumbling)

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.930
are in alignment.

01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:34.093
It is time to change the
world with the becoming.

01:40:35.464 --> 01:40:37.170
(bass thumping)

01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:40.003
(woman screaming)

01:40:43.514 --> 01:40:46.797
(thunder rumbling)

01:40:46.797 --> 01:40:49.880
(music intensifying)

01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:00.690
All hail Chihimatul.

01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:02.920
We are one with her now

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.973
and I am her protector!

01:41:05.969 --> 01:41:08.782
I call upon the ancient powers of Strigoy.

01:41:10.657 --> 01:41:12.907
(snarling)

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.900
- So this is what happens?

01:41:18.856 --> 01:41:22.189
(snarling and gurgling)

01:41:45.688 --> 01:41:49.021
(snarling and gurgling)

01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:53.500
- Okay, I guess we better do something

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.550
besides watch this like it's a bad movie.

01:41:57.501 --> 01:42:01.084
(intense percussive music)

01:42:03.143 --> 01:42:05.809
(corn rustling)

01:42:22.322 --> 01:42:24.013
Smile, you son of a bitch.

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.753
(squishing)

01:42:37.362 --> 01:42:39.362
- Have a grenade, bitch.

01:42:43.057 --> 01:42:45.557
(eerie music)

01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.826
(explosion booming)

01:42:50.826 --> 01:42:53.159
(splatting)

01:42:54.179 --> 01:42:56.929
(dramatic music)

01:43:09.079 --> 01:43:12.079
(crickets chirping)

01:43:21.505 --> 01:43:23.963
I guess we did it.

01:43:24.962 --> 01:43:26.650
(both chuckling)

01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:30.820
Now this is a story for your paper.

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:31.963
- Yeah, but.

01:43:33.659 --> 01:43:35.639
That was really Bigfoot.

01:43:35.639 --> 01:43:36.680
- Yeah.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.384
With a big fucking rock.

01:43:38.384 --> 01:43:41.293
- (laughing) I was afraid
he would be real, but,

01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:43.163
- No doubt now.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.920
Let's get out of here so
you can write that up.

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.120
- [Jonathan] You got it.

01:43:55.085 --> 01:43:57.835
(trunk slamming)

01:44:12.139 --> 01:44:12.973
- You ready?

01:44:12.973 --> 01:44:15.150
- Let's do it, brother.

01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:17.817
(ominous music)

01:44:24.598 --> 01:44:27.598
(crickets chirping)

01:44:29.558 --> 01:44:32.058
(eerie music)
