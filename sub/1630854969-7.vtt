Previously
on "Gotham Knights"...

00:03.220 --> 00:06.267
Turner: They think I killed my
dad because I wanted his money.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.572
We're gonna find who
really killed my dad.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.878
Harper: It's
literally impossible

00:08.921 --> 00:10.314
for Felix Harmon
to be the Talon.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.968
If he really is
130 years old

00:12.012 --> 00:13.187
and still in
fighting shape,

00:13.230 --> 00:15.798
who knows what
he can survive?

00:15.841 --> 00:17.147
[Wheeze]

00:17.191 --> 00:18.670
Felix Harmon
had a daughter.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.717
Beware the
Court of Owls

00:21.760 --> 00:23.849
that watches
all the time.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.112
Harvey:Lincoln.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.635
Have you met
my wife Rebecca?

00:26.678 --> 00:27.940
Harvey: No. I don't
believe I have.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.334
Wait. We can't
do this again.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.640
That coin
you showed me,

00:31.683 --> 00:33.642
it means you're
marked for death.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.296
Ugh...

00:35.339 --> 00:36.775
[Thud]

00:36.819 --> 00:38.560
Cullen: They called us
the Gotham Knights.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.214
Harper: I'll take that
over Bruce Wayne's killers.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.519
What do you think's
gonna happen

00:41.563 --> 00:42.868
when they realize
their new heroes

00:42.912 --> 00:45.436
are also their
most wanted fugitives?

I need backup.

Uh!

01:58.770 --> 01:59.815
Ugh!

02:07.692 --> 02:08.780
Huh!

02:19.922 --> 02:21.228
If you're just joining
us this morning,

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186
our top story is the
latest in a string

02:23.230 --> 02:24.709
of high-profile
art heists

02:24.753 --> 02:26.537
that has swept the
city in recent days.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.496
City Hall was the
target last night,

02:28.539 --> 02:30.280
and, while authorities
won't confirm

02:30.324 --> 02:32.021
which of the many
high-priced items

02:32.064 --> 02:34.415
was stolen, a source
close to the investigation

02:34.458 --> 02:37.548
suggests the stolen piece
is worth millions.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.246
Under pressure
to catch the thief,

02:39.289 --> 02:41.073
Commissioner Val Soto
announced this morning

02:41.117 --> 02:43.511
that the GCPD
enlisted the help

02:43.554 --> 02:46.296
of noted criminologist
Detective Sophia Green.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.168
Now, Gothamites
may remember Green

02:48.211 --> 02:49.821
as the detective
who brought down

02:49.865 --> 02:51.562
notorious burglar
Margaret Pye,

02:51.606 --> 02:53.695
otherwise known
as Magpie.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.000
Woman, on TV: Well, I don't
know about you, Lynette,

02:55.043 --> 02:56.480
but I think this
sounds like a job

02:56.524 --> 02:58.874
for our new local heroes
the Gotham Knights.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.529
The mysterious vigilantes
recently brought down

03:01.572 --> 03:03.052
a drug-smuggling ring...

03:03.095 --> 03:04.401
And we'll be taking
a hard pass

03:04.445 --> 03:08.449
on overpriced
swirls of paint.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.320
There's a little bit
more to them than that.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.192
You seriously want
to stick your neck out

03:12.235 --> 03:14.237
to collect pretty things
for rich people?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.196
"Collecting pretty things
for rich people" describes

03:16.239 --> 03:18.328
about almost every job
we've ever pulled.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.590
Duela: Well, yeah,
but you were paid

03:19.634 --> 03:21.244
cash money
to do those jobs.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.811
There's this video
of the Gotham Knights

03:22.853 --> 03:24.856
papering the streets
with millions.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.554
Yeah, that thing,
and it went viral.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.904
Why do they have
to keep replaying

03:28.947 --> 03:30.862
the worst day
of my life?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.995
Well, at least we didn't walk
away from that empty-handed.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.953
Speak
for yourself.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.825
We got the ledger.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.870
I'm not sure what we get
from an art history field trip.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.176
What, so
those paintings

03:40.220 --> 03:41.525
just get sold
on the black market,

03:41.569 --> 03:43.048
public never gets
to see them again

03:43.091 --> 03:44.398
because
cultural artifacts

03:44.441 --> 03:46.051
aren't as sexy
as a mob day planner?

03:46.095 --> 03:47.879
-100%.
-Exactly.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.228
God forbid we try
and save anything

03:49.272 --> 03:50.447
that'll outlast
ourselves.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.144
It's not that.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.972
It's just, we have way
bigger problems right now

03:54.016 --> 03:55.800
Well, you're
right about that.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.192
MM Good Doughnuts
was out

03:57.237 --> 03:58.281
of strawberry frosted
with sprinkles.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.240
That's my
favorite flavor.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.111
How's Brody doing?

04:02.154 --> 04:03.982
His dad's in a coma
with a hole through him,

04:04.026 --> 04:05.419
and the attacker's
still at large,

04:05.462 --> 04:07.421
so...not great,

04:07.464 --> 04:09.814
and nobody can tell him
who did it or why.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.728
Then it probably won't
comfort him to know

04:11.773 --> 04:13.557
that it was an assassin
as old as the light bulb,

04:13.601 --> 04:16.560
and until we can figure out
how the Talon's lived so long,

04:16.603 --> 04:18.562
we've got about as many
answers as Brody.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.651
There might be a way
to find out.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.133
Yeah? How?

04:24.176 --> 04:27.136
I said I'd get you
answers, not give them.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.791
Anybody else
worried about that?

04:29.834 --> 04:31.183
Cullen: I'm just
glad the Talon's

04:31.227 --> 04:32.663
on someone else's
radar besides ours.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.186
Yeah. It might be helpful
if Harvey Dent

04:34.230 --> 04:36.058
could clue the GCPD in
to who did it

04:36.101 --> 04:38.321
instead of going with "unknown,
sword-wielding assailant"

04:38.365 --> 04:40.628
that he couldn't see
because the power went out.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.107
Harvey's smart
enough to know

04:42.151 --> 04:43.761
that would make
him sound insane.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.023
If he goes public with
that, he's gonna sound

04:45.067 --> 04:46.155
like a crazy
conspiracy theorist.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.417
And he's ahead
in the polls.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.897
He knows he can
help us more

04:48.940 --> 04:50.377
if he's doing it from
the mayor's office.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.467
If he gets
elected.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.599
[EKG beeping]

04:58.298 --> 04:59.864
[Knocks on door]

05:02.737 --> 05:04.478
Harvey.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.436
How is he?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.959
He got through
the surgery,

05:08.003 --> 05:09.657
but then
a few hours later,

05:09.700 --> 05:11.180
it all went south.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.964
He's been in
a coma ever since.

05:13.008 --> 05:16.054
Oh. How are you?

05:18.709 --> 05:21.321
Exhausted, stressed...

05:23.627 --> 05:25.629
worried.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.457
Want to get
some air?

05:32.462 --> 05:35.117
When I heard Lincoln was
attacked at your office,

05:35.159 --> 05:36.945
I panicked.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.948
I'm sure you were
wondering why him, not me.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.167
All I could think
about was you.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.128
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

05:46.171 --> 05:48.565
but in that moment,
I couldn't bear

05:48.609 --> 05:52.830
the thought of something
happening to you.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.746
-To me?
-Mm-hmm.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.445
-Rebecca--
-Harvey...

05:58.488 --> 06:01.099
what the hell is
going on in Gotham?

06:01.143 --> 06:02.971
I don't know,

06:03.014 --> 06:04.929
but until I can get
to the bottom of it,

06:04.973 --> 06:07.715
you and Brody need
to get out of the city.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.717
It is not safe, OK?

06:09.760 --> 06:14.591
Now, Rebecca, you
can't trust anyone.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.506
Can I trust you?

06:19.161 --> 06:21.424
Of course I can.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.257
Man: I don't get it.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.476
I mean, first, the guy
doesn't think twice

06:29.519 --> 06:30.651
about tripping
the alarm.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.087
Then once
the alarms go off,

06:32.130 --> 06:33.741
he just waits
for security.

06:33.784 --> 06:37.135
I mean, is he being
cocky or just dumb?

06:37.179 --> 06:39.355
Sophia:
He's being smart.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.313
The thief waits
for security to arrive

06:41.357 --> 06:43.272
so he can take them out
because if they're down,

06:43.315 --> 06:45.579
they can't pursue,
and they can't shoot at him

06:45.622 --> 06:47.668
as he makes his way
up and out,

06:47.711 --> 06:49.931
and now he has an 18th-century
American landscape

06:49.974 --> 06:52.324
to go with the surrealist piece
he stole from the Met

06:52.368 --> 06:53.935
and the abstract impressionist
canvas he boosted

06:53.978 --> 06:56.459
from the Gotham
Museum of Art--

06:56.503 --> 06:58.766
interesting mix of paintings
he's collecting.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.202
Well, I'm more
concerned with

07:00.245 --> 07:01.899
the interesting mix
of M.O.s he's using,

07:01.943 --> 07:03.466
I mean, different
style of entry

07:03.510 --> 07:05.337
and exit
for every heist.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.687
High-end thieves
like this,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.602
they spend years
honing their craft.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.865
What kind of burglar
changes their M.O.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.650
from job to job?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.566
One that doesn't
want to get caught.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.312
Carrie: Got your text.
Stolen car?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.748
Hey.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.271
You stole the school's
driver's ed. car?

07:26.315 --> 07:27.925
What? When you
bring it back,

07:27.969 --> 07:29.623
it's called borrowing,
thank you,

07:29.666 --> 07:31.276
and it was
surprisingly easy,

07:31.320 --> 07:32.800
I mean, once
I figured out

07:32.843 --> 07:34.932
which steering wheel
to hot-wire.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.368
Turns out, it's
the one you think.

07:36.412 --> 07:38.501
Cool. I'm still
wondering why.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.069
We need answers on how
the Talon's so spry

07:41.112 --> 07:43.550
after a
quasquicentennial.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.639
-Hmm.
-I looked it up.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.379
And what answers do you
think you're gonna find

07:47.423 --> 07:49.425
in a 4-door
educational tool?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.296
Eh, you always do ask
the right questions,

07:51.340 --> 07:53.473
Little Bird,
and let's just say

07:53.516 --> 07:56.650
the car isn't the only
thing I borrowed.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.043
Ta-da!
Look who's back.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.958
[Muffled screaming]

08:01.002 --> 08:02.873
Eunice?

08:04.788 --> 08:06.790
Turner: So you want help
with your homework?

08:06.834 --> 08:09.271
More like
extra credit.

08:09.314 --> 08:12.013
Cullen and I were chatting
over coffee and crullers

08:12.056 --> 08:14.494
about the stolen paintings
and the importance of art,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.321
and it kind of
got me thinking,

08:16.365 --> 08:20.717
so I did a little digital
digging into the cases.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.198
Trouble is,
the paintings

08:23.241 --> 08:24.982
didn't have
anything in common.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.244
There's no pattern.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.855
Why steal these,
especially when,

08:27.898 --> 08:29.900
as I found out,
in most of the burglaries,

08:29.944 --> 08:31.336
the thief passed over
other works of art

08:31.380 --> 08:32.686
that were
much more valuable

08:32.729 --> 08:34.121
than the ones
that were stolen?

08:34.164 --> 08:36.167
So they're after
specific ones.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.474
Or maybe the buyer's
just really eclectic.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.607
Or maybe there
actually is a pattern.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.174
Or maybe this is the most
low-stakes mystery ever

08:44.219 --> 08:45.699
and I'm not sure
why I should care

08:45.742 --> 08:46.743
about the Case of
the Missing Doodles

08:46.787 --> 08:49.006
for Rich People.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.095
What if that rich person
was Alan Wayne?

08:53.445 --> 08:55.273
Every painting that
was taken was owned

08:55.317 --> 08:57.101
by Alan Wayne at
the time of his death.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.452
After that,
they changed hands,

09:00.496 --> 09:01.976
moving from
gallery to gallery,

09:02.019 --> 09:04.369
owner to owner, but
they all used to be his.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.893
That can't be
a coincidence.

09:05.936 --> 09:09.157
Nope.
It's a pattern.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.550
And who do we know
that's interested

09:10.593 --> 09:12.334
in all things
Alan Wayne?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.814
The Court of Owls.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.033
It could be them.
Could not be.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.254
I mean, but
to really be sure...

09:19.297 --> 09:21.691
Is to solve the Case
of the Missing Doodles

09:21.735 --> 09:23.693
for Rich People.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.348
Looks like this is a job for
the Gotham Knights after all.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.702
[Muffled shouting]

09:32.746 --> 09:34.748
This is crazy,
even for you.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.227
I know your dad
was a villain,

09:36.271 --> 09:37.272

that you have to be.

This is
seriously wrong.

get you out of there, OK,

to be nice.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.327
Do not make me
tase you again.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.981
You tased
a senior citizen?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.854
I put it on the lowest
setting. It's fine.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.464
This is
elder abuse.

Elder abuse? Really?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.336
You want to talk

what that poor

to see her gone, OK?

can figure out

10:14.309 --> 10:16.137
what makes him
live so long,

10:16.180 --> 10:19.183
maybe we can figure out
what'll make him die,

is just as stumped

as we are
on all these art heists,

11:00.137 --> 11:02.226
before Green could
slap the cuffs on them.

Well, where are
you headed?

to leave behind

of the computer

to get some
real answers.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.063
The nation's top art cop
has no idea who the thief is.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.108
And you know
who knows more

11:14.151 --> 11:15.762
about crime
than cops?

there with him?
