00:01.485 --> 00:02.576
- You got this.

00:02.652 --> 00:04.986
(laughing)
Here you go!

00:05.064 --> 00:06.988
- Woah!
- Keep your balance!

00:07.082 --> 00:09.258
(soft music)

00:09.993 --> 00:12.494
- Woah! Oh!

00:12.571 --> 00:13.512
- Okay.

00:13.589 --> 00:15.422
- Steady?

00:15.499 --> 00:17.090
There we go.

00:17.167 --> 00:20.185
Pedal! Pedal!

00:20.337 --> 00:22.412
- Way to go, Andy,
you're doing it!

00:22.414 --> 00:24.356
(laughing happily)
He's actually doing it!

00:24.433 --> 00:25.615
- Oh, he's fast.

00:25.617 --> 00:27.151
(laughing)

00:34.443 --> 00:35.701
Andy!

00:40.616 --> 00:42.282
- Andy?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.668
(tense music)

00:48.382 --> 00:50.274
- Andy!
- Andy!

00:50.292 --> 00:52.384
- He must have gone all the way
around to the house.

00:52.461 --> 00:55.203
- Excuse me, um...
Um, I'm looking for my son.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.448
He's riding a red bike.
He's wearing a camo helmet.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.874
(panting)

00:59.894 --> 01:01.376
- Andy?
- Have you seen him?

01:01.453 --> 01:03.228
- No.
- Have you seen him?

01:03.956 --> 01:07.291
Sir! Sir! Sir!
This is my boy.

01:07.309 --> 01:10.127
This little boy,
have you seen him?

01:10.145 --> 01:11.719
- I'm sorry.
(crying)

01:11.797 --> 01:13.555
- Anything?
- No...

01:13.632 --> 01:15.557
- I'm sorry, please.

01:15.634 --> 01:18.410
Our boy, have you seen him?
His name's Andy.

01:18.487 --> 01:21.121
(panting)

01:23.400 --> 01:25.626
(theme music)

01:36.413 --> 01:37.504
(knocking on door)

01:37.656 --> 01:39.598
- Did you get it?
Please tell me you got it.

01:39.825 --> 01:42.083
- You know that I used to
handle security for the Sixers.

01:42.161 --> 01:43.343
- You didn't get it.
- They were out of stock,

01:43.495 --> 01:45.329
but the owner's son,
he has one.

01:45.347 --> 01:47.848
He has a test tomorrow,
but for a pair of floor seats...

01:48.000 --> 01:49.166
- You can get floor seats?

01:49.184 --> 01:51.351
- Not unless I moonlight
for like a month,

01:51.503 --> 01:53.445
but seeing as my nights
have been pretty free lately...

01:53.597 --> 01:55.689
(excited screaming)
- You got it!

01:55.841 --> 01:57.932
- I got it! I don't know
what a graphing calculator does,

01:58.010 --> 01:59.176
but I got one.

01:59.194 --> 02:00.602
- I know that I could've
ordered one,

02:00.679 --> 02:02.846
but I really wanted him
to have everything he needs

02:02.865 --> 02:03.864
for his first day of school.

02:04.183 --> 02:06.183
- Sidney told me that
you're running his DNA?

02:06.201 --> 02:07.626
- This is to do
differential calculus.

02:07.703 --> 02:10.295
Which means that he can do
differential calculus.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.447
Our son, who could barely
do long division.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.524
- When he was away,
he was given books.

02:14.526 --> 02:16.543
He said he studied.
He said studying was

02:16.695 --> 02:18.712
the only thing that he could do.
- I know. And that's all I need.

02:18.864 --> 02:21.789
But Sidney, she needs more.
I really hope that she gets it

02:21.867 --> 02:23.976
when the results come back.
- You don't have to hope.

02:24.127 --> 02:26.228
It's him.

02:27.389 --> 02:28.814
- There he is!

02:28.965 --> 02:30.816
Ready for your first day
of school?

02:30.967 --> 02:32.467
- I think so.
- Hey, tonight,

02:32.544 --> 02:34.895
we celebrate your first day.
- Sounds great.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.546
- You're not going
anywhere, mister.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.323
It's a school night
and I'm making meatloaf.

02:38.475 --> 02:41.568
- Meatloaf. House specialty.
What's the occasion?

02:42.237 --> 02:44.663
- Finally! Come on,
you're gonna be late.

02:44.814 --> 02:45.980
You gotta go.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.482
- Aren't you forgetting
something?

02:47.484 --> 02:49.893
First day of school photos.
Come on, by the fridge.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.062
Say, "I'm back"!

02:52.080 --> 02:53.338
- I'm back!
(camera shutter clicks)

02:53.490 --> 02:55.248
- Sidney, you're in
a lovely mood.

02:55.325 --> 02:57.342
- Yeah, I am. I feel like
today's gonna be an A+ day.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.069
Mm-mmm.
(camera shutter clicks)

02:59.087 --> 03:01.513
(alert ringing)

03:16.030 --> 03:18.030
- Look who's famous.

03:19.441 --> 03:20.991
Valuable too.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.278
- Neighborhood's being
canvassed.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.188
So far, there's no witnesses
and no video.

03:27.266 --> 03:28.765
- And the parents?
- In your office.

03:28.784 --> 03:32.269
There's no work history
on Mom, but Dad is a doctor

03:32.271 --> 03:34.046
who just had a patent
on a cancer drug

03:34.122 --> 03:36.289
that just went into production.
We're running the financials,

03:36.366 --> 03:38.550
but it looks like he stands
to make a fortune on it.

03:39.628 --> 03:43.388
- Hey. Andy's six.
And he's very cute,

03:43.465 --> 03:47.375
so if you could put
some extra mo in your mojo,
that would be great.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.135
- I need you to paint
these candles.

03:49.212 --> 03:52.213
- Why?
- Because I don't do dark magic.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.216
And if I did,
I'd use animal blood.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.051
- Oh, I'm sure there's a pig
smiling somewhere,

03:57.071 --> 03:58.462
but why me, I meant?

03:58.480 --> 04:01.055
- Because this isn't for Andy.
It's for Sidney.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.057
I had a bad dream
about her.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.985
I need to cleanse her.

04:05.061 --> 04:07.137
- Soap and water's no good?

04:07.155 --> 04:08.896
- Can you take the candles?
Just paint them.

04:08.974 --> 04:10.231
- Sure.
- Thank you.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.325
- The answer is no.
- I know it's hard to imagine--

04:12.327 --> 04:14.920
- It's not someone we know.
- Somebody you work with, then?

04:15.071 --> 04:16.830
You're about to make
a lot of money.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.633
- Yes, from helping people.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.210
- Pat, honey.

04:22.321 --> 04:24.170
We know that Steve
adopted Andy.

04:24.323 --> 04:27.749
Can you talk to us about
his biological father?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.101
- Fairy tales.

04:29.177 --> 04:31.419
He can't sleep until
I've read him one.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.513
- I need you to stay with me.
- His bedtime is 8:00.

04:33.665 --> 04:35.832
He needs to be back by then.
- His dad.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.501
Tell us about his dad.

04:37.503 --> 04:40.170
- There's nothing to tell.
He's dead.

04:40.263 --> 04:42.364
(phone notification)

04:45.360 --> 04:46.618
Anything?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.512
Pat, who is it?

04:48.530 --> 04:51.456
- It was Lynn.
Sending us prayers.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.276
- Like I said,
it's no one we know.

04:55.354 --> 04:57.187
- Whoever it is,
they might reach out.

04:57.205 --> 04:59.113
Ask for money, a ransom.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.541
And if they do, you need
to tell us about it.

05:01.693 --> 05:03.117
- Of course.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.695
Whatever you tell us
to do we'll do.

05:05.789 --> 05:07.364
- Are you okay?

05:07.366 --> 05:09.957
- Can I use your bathroom?

05:10.035 --> 05:12.477
(panting)

05:13.872 --> 05:15.564
(phone ringing)

05:17.651 --> 05:18.966
- Where is he?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.877
Is he okay?

05:20.896 --> 05:22.062
<i> - 200 grand.</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:25.048
Today. I'll text
the where and the when.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.658
(door opening)

05:28.887 --> 05:30.162
- Who are you?

05:30.238 --> 05:31.905
- Ghost of Christmas past.

05:32.057 --> 05:33.815
<i> Do what I say and the 718</i>

05:33.834 --> 05:35.650
won't come back to haunt you.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.586
(crying)
- Pat?

05:42.734 --> 05:44.009
Hey...

05:44.570 --> 05:45.735
Listen, I...

05:45.754 --> 05:48.680
I can't promise you that
Andy'll be back by 8:00.

05:48.832 --> 05:53.410
But I can say that he will have
his fairy tale ending.

05:53.428 --> 05:57.397
Okay? We get our babies back.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.524
It's what we do.

06:02.604 --> 06:04.571
(soft music)

06:16.043 --> 06:17.951
<i> - We got a hit.</i>
<i> Clark and Webster.</i>

06:18.103 --> 06:19.327
- Let's do it.

06:20.455 --> 06:23.030
I saw you and Nicole
came to work together.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.083
- Yeah, it's Keith's
first day at school.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.367
- I know.
There's times like this,

06:26.387 --> 06:29.036
a dad's gotta be there.
You have to be there.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.722
Even after tonight.
- What's tonight?

06:30.799 --> 06:33.058
- Nicole and I are telling
the kids about the engagement.

06:33.209 --> 06:35.376
She didn't tell you, did she?
- The meatloaf.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.062
- I'm told
it's the house specialty.

06:37.213 --> 06:39.305
- How old are you?
- I mean it. You're their dad,

06:39.382 --> 06:41.474
this doesn't change that.
- Were you born in the '90s?

06:41.551 --> 06:44.127
You know what,
don't answer that...

06:44.220 --> 06:46.029
It could incriminate you.
Let's go.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.325
- There he is.

06:54.063 --> 06:55.414
- Go.
- What are you gonna do?

06:55.490 --> 06:57.064
You're gonna go around
or something?

06:57.142 --> 06:58.417
- No, I'm giving you
a head start.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.160
I figured at your age,
you could use it.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.737
- He's getting away.
- From you, maybe.

07:03.239 --> 07:06.091
- Do not expose my children
to Wilson Phillips.

07:06.242 --> 07:08.093
(chuckles)
Hey!

07:13.100 --> 07:14.991
- I got it, old man.

07:15.010 --> 07:17.160
(grunting)

07:17.179 --> 07:18.678
Hey, where is he?

07:18.755 --> 07:20.922
Where's the boy?
- I don't know about a boy!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.182
- The boy you stole from.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.592
- I didn't steal nothing, man!
- Hey! This boy.

07:24.670 --> 07:27.671
- If you didn't steal nothing,
then where did you get this?

07:27.673 --> 07:29.531
- I'll show you.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.575
- Let's go.

07:33.454 --> 07:37.347
- This is where I found it.
I didn't see no boy.

07:37.365 --> 07:39.975
- Okay. Whoever took Andy
was definitely here.

07:39.977 --> 07:43.086
We get a security camera,
we get an ID.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.316
- Hey, I need you to run
a plate for me.

07:48.393 --> 07:52.045
4-8-Delta-2-Kilo-3-Papa.

07:52.121 --> 07:53.472
Yeah, call me back. Thanks.

07:53.623 --> 07:55.173
- You heard me, right?
I said a security camera.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.534
- Yeah, the car is
a security camera.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.385
It has a feature on it
called Sentry Mode

07:59.462 --> 08:01.387
that records
suspicious activity.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.556
It also alerts the owner
when it's being vandalized.

08:03.709 --> 08:07.986
So, we'll run the plates,
we'll get a name and then,
we'll make a call.

08:08.063 --> 08:09.062
- Well, we don't have time
for that.

08:09.138 --> 08:10.230
- What, you got a better idea?

08:10.324 --> 08:12.549
- You're saying that if this car
gets vandalized,

08:12.567 --> 08:14.384
the driver gets notified
immediately?

08:14.386 --> 08:15.827
- Yeah, it's an app
on his phone.

08:16.054 --> 08:17.579
- Then yeah,
I got a better idea.

08:29.084 --> 08:30.992
- Look who the cat dragged in.

08:31.069 --> 08:34.596
- Hi, Andy. I'm Vicki.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.240
I know you're scared right now.

08:37.242 --> 08:40.685
But I'm gonna take
real good care of you.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.646
- I wanna go home.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.599
- I know, honey. I do.

08:47.435 --> 08:51.363
And here's the thing...
You are home.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.492
(tense music)

09:03.210 --> 09:04.709
(humming)

09:05.045 --> 09:07.194
<i> - So you skipped a grade,</i>
<i> and now, we've got</i>
<i> classes together.</i>

09:07.214 --> 09:09.196
This is not a buddy system.
I'm not your lifeguard.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.957
We walk through that door
and you drown,

09:11.109 --> 09:12.700
I'm not giving you CPR. Got it?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.219
- Got it. No CPR.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.429
- Good.
Welcome to high school.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.206
<i> - Hey.</i>

09:19.301 --> 09:21.601
(indistinct chatter)

09:28.885 --> 09:31.361
(humming continues)

09:33.056 --> 09:35.799
(phone ringing)

09:35.817 --> 09:37.033
- Detective Adebayo.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.153
Yeah, I asked for
their financials.

09:40.229 --> 09:41.988
<i> - You did what?</i>

09:42.140 --> 09:44.082
- We shot a car.
- No, no, he shot a car.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.976
- A parked car.
With no one in it?

09:46.995 --> 09:49.421
- Just to be clear, he--
- We shot the car

09:49.572 --> 09:51.664
to let the driver know
that it'd been vandalized.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.333
- Okay, let me get this
straight. So you vandalized it

09:53.485 --> 09:55.427
so the driver would know
that it was vandalized.

09:55.654 --> 09:58.263
- We vandalized the car so that
the driver would show up,

09:58.414 --> 10:00.765
access the sentry system
and give us this.

10:00.917 --> 10:05.419
- The beater's registered
to a Brad Skinner at
a Bronx address.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.939
We've added it to the alert
and then contacted NYPD.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.423
They have him
on three priors:

10:09.501 --> 10:11.443
possession, assault
and armed robbery.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.353
- And now, as a kidnapper.
- And that's Andy.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.355
Any connection
to Andy's parents?

10:15.357 --> 10:17.431
- Not that we can find.
- I found one.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.620
An hour ago, Steve
made a $200,000 withdrawal.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.180
Unless he had a sudden urge
to join a country club,

10:24.182 --> 10:25.682
I'd say it's a ransom payment.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.293
- Didn't we tell them to contact
us if there was a demand?

10:28.444 --> 10:30.444
- Clearly, he didn't.
We need to find out why.

10:30.522 --> 10:32.130
And Skinner, if he left a trail,

10:32.281 --> 10:33.298
we need to find it.
- That's us.

10:33.525 --> 10:34.782
- About Keith. What...
What about the DNA?

10:34.860 --> 10:36.876
- I haven't heard,
but I'll let you know once I do.

10:36.953 --> 10:38.878
- Like you'll let me know about
the engagement party, or...

10:38.955 --> 10:41.381
- It's not a party.
And I just didn't want
to say anything

10:41.533 --> 10:43.808
in front of the kids. Keith's
back, Jay. He's settling in.

10:43.885 --> 10:44.884
It's time to move on.

10:45.203 --> 10:46.478
- So you and June have
something in common now.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.538
- She wants a child.
You raise great ones,

10:48.556 --> 10:49.981
and now you're ready
to have one with her.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.708
She'd be an idiot
not to come back.

10:51.726 --> 10:55.028
I just wouldn't shoot up
any more cars until she does.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.730
(sirens blaring)

10:57.883 --> 10:59.215
- I'm not giving him back.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.402
- Chillax. I'm just bringing
him so that they think we are.

11:02.554 --> 11:05.238
- Ransom wasn't the plan.
- Let's go.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.650
Having a kid's expensive.
This way, they cover his nut.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.653
Hey! I said we're going.

11:12.731 --> 11:14.321
(grunts)

11:15.233 --> 11:17.658
- I'll call the cops.
Swear to God I will.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.920
- Yeah? And tell them what?
- The truth about Andy.

11:21.072 --> 11:22.830
I got that to protect me.

11:22.908 --> 11:24.073
What's your excuse?

11:24.092 --> 11:26.434
- You ain't calling no one.

11:28.430 --> 11:30.021
Let's go!

11:31.433 --> 11:34.083
- Is this him?
Did he take Andy?

11:34.102 --> 11:35.360
- We were hoping
you could tell us.

11:35.511 --> 11:37.420
- I told you, I don't know
who took him.

11:37.422 --> 11:39.272
- You did. And an hour later,

11:39.424 --> 11:41.348
you made a $200,000
withdrawal.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.443
- Did this man take my son?

11:43.595 --> 11:44.761
Do you know where he is?

11:45.021 --> 11:47.188
- We understand why people keep
ransom demands a secret.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.432
But you should not.
- I'm not.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.376
There hasn't been a demand.

11:52.528 --> 11:55.271
I don't know who this is,
and I didn't withdraw any money.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.549
- Pat, where is she?
- She's with a friend, Lynn.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.442
- You need to get her
on the phone,

11:59.444 --> 12:00.960
because we gotta ask her
some questions.

12:01.037 --> 12:02.612
- Like why she took out
that money.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.631
Because it was withdrawn,
and if you didn't do it,
who else could?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.284
- This is ridiculous.
She did nothing.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.103
She's with a friend.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.565
Lynn.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.276
I was calling for Pat...

12:16.962 --> 12:18.811
No, no updates...

12:19.722 --> 12:22.198
Just have her call me
when she gets back?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.453
She went for a walk.

12:27.305 --> 12:29.063
- Um. And left her phone?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.990
Risk missing a call
about her son?

12:31.067 --> 12:32.566
- What other explanation
is there?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.753
<i> - That the kidnapper</i>
<i>told her not to bring the phone.</i>

12:34.829 --> 12:37.714
So that we couldn't trace it
to the ransom drop.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.484
- I found it. Skinner's trail.

12:41.486 --> 12:43.744
Credit card payment
on a motel on 6th.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.171
- Alright,
well, I'll notify SWAT.

12:45.323 --> 12:47.599
- Hey, been there done that.
Let's go.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.726
(tense music)

12:50.771 --> 12:52.270
Police!

12:52.347 --> 12:55.064
(♪♪)

12:59.428 --> 13:00.612
(sighing)

13:02.265 --> 13:04.765
- The desk clerk said that
there was three of them.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.269
Andy, Skinner and a woman.
I got a description, but no ID.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.680
So we're pulling CCTV
and dusting the room.

13:10.698 --> 13:12.624
- Find out who they are
to find out where they are.

13:12.775 --> 13:15.276
That's what we always say.
But with a child...

13:15.295 --> 13:16.961
I promised a fairy tale ending.

13:17.113 --> 13:18.296
Because that's all
I know about Andy.

13:18.447 --> 13:21.691
That he's a child who
likes children's stories.

13:21.693 --> 13:24.636
- Fairy tales are a particular
type of children's story.

13:24.787 --> 13:29.048
- My point is that we know
nothing. We've got nothing.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.717
Except that Andy
likes terrifying stories.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.220
- Fairy tales
are terrifying for a reason.

13:34.297 --> 13:37.148
They teach children
no matter what to persevere.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.208
That the world
is a dangerous place

13:39.227 --> 13:40.819
and no one is going
to save you,

13:40.970 --> 13:42.654
so you have to save yourself.

13:44.399 --> 13:46.899
- There were gummies
in the room, right?

13:47.052 --> 13:48.701
- Yeah, on the floor, why?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.831
- Because maybe knowing
who Andy is

13:52.907 --> 13:54.815
will help us find him after all.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.125
(Kemi scoffs)

13:56.911 --> 13:58.628
(♪♪)

14:11.292 --> 14:12.559
(sighs)

14:23.363 --> 14:25.254
- So, M.E. is still determining
the cause of death.

14:25.273 --> 14:27.256
But it looks like a gunshot
wound to the chest,

14:27.275 --> 14:29.317
but there are lacerations
around his neck.

14:29.352 --> 14:31.369
- That lines up with
our witness testimony.

14:31.930 --> 14:35.281
She observed Brad on the ground,
Pat kneeling over him.

14:35.433 --> 14:38.543
<i> And then she claims she saw</i>
<i> Pat stab him in the neck.</i>

14:38.620 --> 14:41.120
<i> - If Pat was here,</i>
<i> she's fled the scene.</i>

14:41.272 --> 14:43.106
PPD finished a search
of the park

14:43.199 --> 14:44.883
and no sign of her or Andy.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.551
- What about the 200k in cash?

14:46.628 --> 14:49.112
- It's unaccounted for.
- And those?

14:49.130 --> 14:50.630
- These were in
Skinner's jacket.

14:50.782 --> 14:53.299
One is his and the other,
it's unclear.

14:53.376 --> 14:54.784
We'll have to run a IMEI.

14:54.802 --> 14:58.379
- Alright, we'll call it in
on the way back.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.974
- Um, are you familiar
with Egungun-Oya?

15:02.093 --> 15:03.735
- Definitely not.

15:03.811 --> 15:05.236
- Okay, she's the Mother
of the dead.

15:05.388 --> 15:07.313
She guides the destinies
of the deceased.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.723
And in Sidney's case,
the living.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.816
- Sidney?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.227
- There's a darkness
in her eyes.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.562
I believe she's haunted.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.975
- She's been having trouble
processing Keith's return.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.568
Let's just say
she's a tad overwhelmed.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.255
- Do you mind
if I pray with her?

15:24.332 --> 15:26.699
- Um... I'll leave it up to her.

15:26.776 --> 15:31.262
If she's open to it, you know,
you have my blessing.

15:31.414 --> 15:32.931
- Thank you.

15:33.082 --> 15:35.266
(school bell rings)

15:35.418 --> 15:37.602
- Target acquired,
11 o'clock.

15:39.998 --> 15:40.921
- Um.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.923
I almost feel bad for him.

15:43.001 --> 15:45.092
- Do you think we should
let him sit with us?

15:45.170 --> 15:47.403
- I said almost.
- Hey, Keith!

15:48.097 --> 15:49.263
(indistinct chatter)

15:49.340 --> 15:51.950
- Oh my God, is he friends
with Bianca?

15:52.026 --> 15:53.267
- He wasn't.

15:53.344 --> 15:54.619
- Your brother is sitting
at Mount Olympus

15:54.696 --> 15:56.955
with Bianca Delvain
and the other gods.

15:57.031 --> 15:58.122
- He's not my brother.
(scoffs)

15:58.349 --> 16:00.441
- How's it going?
- Hey, um... I'm Keith.

16:00.518 --> 16:02.868
- Yeah, I know.
- Perfection.

16:03.021 --> 16:04.445
This is perfection.

16:04.522 --> 16:06.613
(sighing)
- Just let it suck.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.450
Once the DNA test comes back,
it'll be over.

16:09.527 --> 16:10.710
- Will it?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.212
After what happened,
I didn't sleep for a whole night

16:13.364 --> 16:15.198
for like almost three years.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.383
Every time I closed my eyes,
I could see him.

16:17.535 --> 16:20.369
His face...
The way he looked at me.

16:20.371 --> 16:22.796
The surprise. The terror.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.649
- Sid, we were 12.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.652
- Yes. But you didn't
have to look your parents
in the eye every morning

16:27.729 --> 16:28.728
and lie to them,

16:28.804 --> 16:30.471
watching their hopes
fade day-by-day,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.414
thinking that they might
see Keith again.

16:32.416 --> 16:34.217
And then watch their marriage
fall apart

16:34.219 --> 16:35.476
because of the horrible
thing you did.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.811
And then this... guy
shows up, looking like Keith.

16:37.889 --> 16:40.814
And acting like Keith.
For God knows what reason.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.333
And...

16:42.985 --> 16:44.452
It just took so long to move on.

16:44.528 --> 16:46.412
And now, it feels like it's
happening all over again.

16:46.564 --> 16:48.322
And since
I didn't say anything then,

16:48.399 --> 16:52.427
I can't say anything now.
So I'm... I'm trapped.

16:54.572 --> 16:56.422
(intriguing music)

16:56.499 --> 16:58.257
- The Medical Examiner's
report is in.

16:58.334 --> 17:01.001
Brad Skinner
died almost instantly

17:01.021 --> 17:02.353
from a gunshot to the chest.

17:02.505 --> 17:04.897
I say almost instantly
because he survived

17:05.007 --> 17:06.691
a few minutes longer due
to medical intervention.

17:06.768 --> 17:08.084
- A medical intervention?

17:08.102 --> 17:10.920
- Turns out Pat wasn't stabbing
Brad in the neck,

17:10.922 --> 17:12.530
she was performing
a field tracheotomy.

17:12.607 --> 17:15.091
The gunshot made
his tongue "edematous".

17:15.109 --> 17:16.776
I had to look that one up too;

17:16.852 --> 17:18.444
it means fluid-filled
or swollen.

17:18.596 --> 17:20.446
So, it looks like she was
trying to create an airway

17:20.598 --> 17:23.266
for him to breathe.
- So if Pat tried to save him,

17:23.284 --> 17:25.101
who tried to kill him?
- Yeah, about that...

17:25.194 --> 17:27.879
I checked out the two phones
you found on the deceased.

17:28.030 --> 17:30.381
One did belong to Brad Skinner.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.383
The other... a woman named
Vicki Parsons.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.294
30. Also from the Bronx.
I'm pulling her history now.

17:35.446 --> 17:37.780
- A possible accomplice?
- That would be my guess.

17:37.782 --> 17:41.117
She matches the description
of the woman who checked into
the motel with Brad.

17:41.135 --> 17:43.061
- So what's our theory here?

17:43.137 --> 17:45.137
That Brad and Vicki Parsons
take Andy,

17:45.290 --> 17:46.472
ransom him to the mother.

17:46.549 --> 17:49.809
Vicki turns on Brad
and runs off with the money?

17:49.961 --> 17:52.236
- Possibly.
But why would Pat try

17:52.313 --> 17:55.147
to save her son's kidnapper?
And who has Andy?

17:55.224 --> 17:56.649
- So, we're looking
for two women,

17:56.801 --> 17:58.484
Pat Wells and Vicki Parsons.

17:58.561 --> 18:00.803
We find them,
we find our missing child.

18:00.805 --> 18:03.039
(intriguing music)

18:07.812 --> 18:09.236
- Hey, TSA got a hit
on Pat Wells.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.256
She just bought a train ticket.
- Let me guess, to the Bronx?

18:12.333 --> 18:14.074
- That's right.
- This whole thing goes back

18:14.152 --> 18:15.409
to the Bronx.
How many tickets?

18:15.486 --> 18:17.470
- One ticket,
traveling alone.

18:21.175 --> 18:23.559
(indistinct announcement
on speakers)

18:30.335 --> 18:33.502
Hey. It's a very
good-looking kid.

18:33.504 --> 18:35.688
It would be a shame if
something happened to him

18:35.764 --> 18:37.949
because you didn't cooperate
with the authorities.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.176
- We know they
contacted you, Pat.

18:40.194 --> 18:41.953
They made demands.

18:42.104 --> 18:44.180
You tried to get Andy
back on your own.

18:44.273 --> 18:46.682
Something went wrong.
You got scared.

18:46.701 --> 18:47.683
So you ran. We get it.

18:47.776 --> 18:50.519
But it's time
to let us help you.

18:50.521 --> 18:52.037
Let us help Andy.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.039
Where is your son?

18:54.116 --> 18:56.008
Who has him?

19:09.798 --> 19:12.483
- Well, would you look at that.

19:13.561 --> 19:15.361
I'm a new woman.

19:21.552 --> 19:24.162
- Andy's not being trafficked,
he's not being ransomed.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.721
Not by Vicki Parsons.
Check it out.

19:25.723 --> 19:28.224
- Okay, the Parsons abducted
him. Ransomed him.

19:28.226 --> 19:32.061
Murdered Brad Skinner.
What, do you think, she's out
there getting him a pony?

19:32.079 --> 19:34.413
- So, listen... Vicki Parsons,
four years ago,

19:34.490 --> 19:36.081
she filed a missing
person's report.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.658
Four years ago,
Andy was two.

19:37.752 --> 19:40.252
The report she filed,
it was about the abduction

19:40.329 --> 19:42.221
of her two-year-old son.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.515
- You wanna hear
something weird?

19:44.592 --> 19:47.076
- Whatever it is,
we just heard something weirder.

19:47.078 --> 19:49.412
- Pat Wells...
is four years old.

19:49.430 --> 19:50.688
- You know what's weird
about that?

19:50.765 --> 19:52.097
I mean, aside from everything,

19:52.250 --> 19:55.100
what's weird about that
is that makes perfect sense.

19:55.603 --> 19:57.102
(phone chiming)
(sighs)

19:57.255 --> 19:58.771
Oh, it's Sidney.

19:58.847 --> 20:00.514
- You know what's really weird?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.683
Is that our daughter's eggs
are being read.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.660
- Makes perfect sense to me.

20:06.597 --> 20:10.499
- Have you found Andy?
Please tell me you've found him.

20:13.287 --> 20:16.631
- Baby, did you withdraw
$200,000?

20:18.459 --> 20:20.384
- I was trying
to get Andy back.

20:20.461 --> 20:23.054
- From Brad Skinner.
Who's now in a body bag.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.205
- All I care about
is finding Andy.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.966
- Which explains the body bag.

20:27.118 --> 20:28.117
- I didn't kill him.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.760
He was dead
when I got there.

20:29.837 --> 20:33.046
- Why don't you talk to me
about Vicki Parsons?

20:34.216 --> 20:36.383
- I don't know who that is.
- Well, four years ago,

20:36.461 --> 20:39.144
Vicki filed a missing
person's report

20:39.221 --> 20:40.721
after her son had been abducted.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.891
Coincidentally,
four years ago, you were born.

20:44.969 --> 20:47.136
Yeah, um...

20:47.154 --> 20:49.413
Driver's license,

20:49.565 --> 20:51.490
social security card,

20:51.567 --> 20:53.233
passport...

20:53.253 --> 20:56.403
Every single one of them
issued four years ago.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.331
Either you dated the Unabomber
before that,

20:59.484 --> 21:02.151
or you teleported in from Mars,

21:02.153 --> 21:04.153
or you changed your identity

21:04.171 --> 21:06.264
after stealing
someone else's kid.

21:06.415 --> 21:09.508
So, yeah, when I said it
was a coincidence,

21:09.602 --> 21:12.645
I... I was being ironic.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.514
Talk to us, baby.

21:15.666 --> 21:19.151
That'll make finding Andy
a whole lot easier.

21:20.671 --> 21:23.197
- I want you to close your eyes
and open your hands.

21:26.193 --> 21:29.436
I want you to put all your bad
energy into those objects.

21:29.514 --> 21:33.040
Once you do, I'll be able to
read them and know if it worked.

21:33.776 --> 21:35.126
Focus.

21:35.686 --> 21:37.019
There you go.

21:38.022 --> 21:40.372
I want you to pay
very close attention.

21:40.858 --> 21:43.801
- Pat Wells, she had a train
ticket to New York.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.361
Vicki Parsons,
Bronx phone number.

21:45.379 --> 21:47.363
- Which gave NYPD an address
to stake out.

21:47.365 --> 21:48.864
- She got a rap sheet
a mile long.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.124
Possession of coke, PCP,
heroin, meth.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.885
She's an equal opportunity
offender.

21:52.961 --> 21:54.703
- Now, we're just
waiting on the financials.

21:54.705 --> 21:55.888
- What about medical records?

21:55.964 --> 21:57.130
What are her eating habits?

21:57.150 --> 21:59.466
I once had a client
had a stalker.

21:59.544 --> 22:01.986
Found that guy based
on his obsession with kielbasa.

22:02.063 --> 22:04.547
- I bet your client
was very happy.

22:04.899 --> 22:06.157
- Yeah, with the result.

22:06.233 --> 22:07.474
With me, not so much.

22:07.476 --> 22:09.385
We had a misunderstanding
about a word.

22:09.403 --> 22:11.162
- One word? What does that mean?

22:11.313 --> 22:13.313
(sighing)
- Ex. As in ex-wife.

22:13.391 --> 22:15.499
I thought she was.
Turns out she was not.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.911
- Pat, honey,
the longer you wait,

22:19.063 --> 22:23.007
the harder it will be for us
to find Andy.

22:25.086 --> 22:27.069
- I was a neonatal nurse.

22:27.738 --> 22:30.005
Working at a NICU in the Bronx.

22:30.499 --> 22:31.590
We got preemies.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.167
Kids who'd lost oxygen
during delivery.

22:34.595 --> 22:37.096
And some of whose mothers
were drug addicts.

22:37.172 --> 22:38.839
- Like Vicki Parsons.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.265
- She never visited.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.252
<i> Andy was fighting for his life</i>

22:43.254 --> 22:45.863
<i> because of her</i>
<i> and she never came.</i>

22:45.940 --> 22:48.032
<i> Not one time in two months.</i>

22:48.109 --> 22:50.117
<i> And in those two months?</i>

22:51.371 --> 22:52.611
I cared for him.

22:52.688 --> 22:55.856
I changed him. I fed him.

22:55.950 --> 22:58.459
I read him fairy tales.

22:59.695 --> 23:02.671
Then she sobered up
and she took him away.

23:04.199 --> 23:06.217
Until she started using again.

23:06.293 --> 23:09.111
Ten months old
and he's back in the ICU.

23:09.113 --> 23:10.779
Dehydrated.

23:10.798 --> 23:12.539
Malnourished.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.392
And yet, he remembered me.

23:14.619 --> 23:16.118
We had a connection.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.546
He was like
this little sunflower

23:19.565 --> 23:23.067
and I was the sun that he
instinctively knew to turn to.

23:23.978 --> 23:26.070
It happened two more times.

23:26.722 --> 23:29.949
Child Protective Services
did nothing to stop it.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.226
She got better.
I lost him.

23:33.304 --> 23:35.228
She got worse.
I got him back.

23:35.306 --> 23:36.897
The last time, I couldn't.

23:37.324 --> 23:39.158
I wouldn't let him go.

23:39.234 --> 23:41.085
I looked in her records,

23:41.162 --> 23:44.547
I got her address
and I watched.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.759
(crying): I didn't have a plan.

23:49.153 --> 23:50.169
- It's okay.

23:50.245 --> 23:52.078
- I just knew that
sooner or later

23:52.156 --> 23:53.505
something bad was gonna happen

23:53.658 --> 23:56.225
and I needed to be there
when it did.

23:59.087 --> 24:01.105
<i> It was a Saturday afternoon.</i>

24:01.774 --> 24:03.165
<i> Blazing hot.</i>

24:03.517 --> 24:06.944
<i> She was high or drunk or both.</i>

24:07.429 --> 24:08.988
She parked.

24:10.098 --> 24:12.575
And just left Andy
in the car.

24:14.528 --> 24:17.580
<i> He would've died if</i>
<i> I hadn't done something.</i>

24:18.624 --> 24:20.541
I couldn't give him back.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.870
Not to her.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.873
So I left the Bronx.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.717
I moved to Philly.

24:31.028 --> 24:32.528
Changed my name.

24:32.530 --> 24:34.513
Met Steven.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.642
- And told him Andy's
father had died.

24:38.794 --> 24:40.552
- He doesn't know any of it.

24:41.038 --> 24:44.389
I didn't want my past
haunting him like it's come
back to haunt me.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.318
- Someone tried to help
Brad Skinner.

24:47.394 --> 24:50.362
Someone with medical expertise.

24:51.065 --> 24:52.490
That was you, wasn't it?

24:53.384 --> 24:56.051
- I thought if I could
keep him alive,

24:56.662 --> 24:59.663
he could tell me
how to find my son.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.250
My son.

25:04.411 --> 25:05.628
Not hers.

25:06.655 --> 25:07.746
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.

25:08.399 --> 25:09.898
The financials were a dead end.

25:09.917 --> 25:12.993
There's no activity on Vicki's
bank account or credit.

25:13.070 --> 25:15.921
Mostly because she doesn't have
a bank account or credit cards.

25:15.998 --> 25:17.239
- Cash only, then, probably.

25:17.332 --> 25:18.498
- Yeah, but not by choice.

25:18.576 --> 25:20.259
She filed for medical
bankruptcy.

25:20.411 --> 25:21.519
So she's drowning in debt.

25:21.595 --> 25:22.853
She's also got chronic
health problems

25:23.005 --> 25:24.170
because of the drug thing.

25:24.248 --> 25:26.190
And she had a pacemaker
implanted last year.

25:26.267 --> 25:29.084
So, long story short, there's
no financial trail to follow.

25:29.086 --> 25:32.938
- You can't follow the money,
you can't follow the kielbasa...

25:33.032 --> 25:34.514
Follow the heart, right?

25:34.592 --> 25:36.425
Hmm.
- No, okay.

25:36.443 --> 25:38.351
I know that look.
That's a bad look.

25:38.429 --> 25:40.663
- No, it's good.
Let's go for a ride. Come on.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.707
(sighing)
Come, come, come.

25:43.859 --> 25:44.875
- Good.

25:46.028 --> 25:49.213
Now crack the eggs in a glass
and I'll read them.

25:55.537 --> 25:57.179
(inhaling deeply)

25:58.966 --> 26:01.058
(Kemi speaking in Hausa)

26:18.652 --> 26:20.035
(sighing)

26:21.247 --> 26:23.897
So now, we'll let them soak

26:23.916 --> 26:25.140
and then I'll read them.

26:25.643 --> 26:28.068
And the candles,
once they burn out.

26:28.145 --> 26:30.996
And the limes,
take those home.

26:31.148 --> 26:33.165
Squeeze those
into 12 cups of water.

26:33.317 --> 26:35.759
Pour it on your body
and don't wash it off.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.412
- Okay. The lime juice,
don't wash it off.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.432
- It'll protect you.

26:42.009 --> 26:43.008
- From what?

26:43.085 --> 26:44.685
You still haven't said.

26:45.587 --> 26:47.679
- If you do as I say,

26:47.832 --> 26:49.440
God willing...

26:50.943 --> 26:52.192
...you'll be okay.

26:54.262 --> 26:56.262
(sighing)
- This seems on the up-and-up.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.616
- This guy's a miracle worker.
Trust me.

27:00.361 --> 27:02.119
Reni!

27:04.290 --> 27:05.956
- What the hell
are you doing here?

27:06.367 --> 27:09.126
- Well, I need you
to track a pacemaker for me.

27:09.277 --> 27:11.161
But where's the southern
hospitality?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.521
- One, I'm from Cleveland.

27:12.539 --> 27:14.131
Two, June told me
what you did.

27:14.282 --> 27:16.133
So why don't you go home
and dip your chachis

27:16.284 --> 27:18.210
in a pot of boiling water,
you faker!

27:18.362 --> 27:20.095
You're not welcome here.

27:20.865 --> 27:22.214
(laughing)

27:22.290 --> 27:25.184
- I must've blinked.
Did I miss the miracle?

27:28.463 --> 27:30.555
- I got a warrant! You want me
to break the door down? Open up.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.875
- There's no way you have a
warrant. Does he have a warrant?

27:32.893 --> 27:36.236
- I don't think he would lie.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

27:37.639 --> 27:40.065
This is a dry-cleaning receipt.
- I know!

27:40.142 --> 27:41.992
- What do you want?
- I want you to...

27:42.144 --> 27:43.327
Will you relax?

27:43.478 --> 27:45.554
Hey, I know you and June
share an alpaca fetish

27:45.572 --> 27:48.815
and that you guys bond over
hypoallergenic fleeces,

27:48.834 --> 27:50.834
whatever, but there's
a child, he's been abducted.

27:50.911 --> 27:54.079
His name's Andy. And right now,
the person who took Andy,

27:54.156 --> 27:55.655
he's getting
further and further away

27:55.733 --> 27:57.232
while you scream spittle
at me all over the place.

27:57.234 --> 27:58.676
- What does that have
to do with me?

27:58.844 --> 28:01.679
- Well, the kidnapper
has a pacemaker
and it's in the cloud.

28:01.830 --> 28:04.089
You can hack anything
because you're brilliant.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.516
I told him that you love kids.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.000
There's nothing you wouldn't
do for children.

28:07.094 --> 28:08.427
You're extremely compassionate.

28:08.503 --> 28:10.521
- And noble.
He used the word noble.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.190
- Nah... I'm just
a regular dude.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.434
- He says you're
a miracle worker.

28:15.510 --> 28:17.528
- That's right.
You are a miracle worker.

28:17.604 --> 28:19.922
Can you make
a miracle happen for Andy?

28:19.940 --> 28:21.365
Can you do that?
- Of course I will.

28:21.442 --> 28:22.441
- Great.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.517
- It's gonna cost you.
- That's fine. How much?

28:24.595 --> 28:25.610
- Apologize to June.

28:25.687 --> 28:26.945
- Alright, that's none
of your business.

28:27.022 --> 28:28.613
For the record,
I did apologize to her.

28:28.690 --> 28:30.782
She doesn't want to talk to me.
- Because you made excuses.

28:30.784 --> 28:33.526
Did you try, without
qualifiers, or justifications,

28:33.604 --> 28:36.672
like K-Stew after Rupertgate,
to just apologize?

28:37.775 --> 28:39.791
Yeah. I didn't think so.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.293
- Okay. Alright.

28:41.369 --> 28:43.612
I'll beg for forgiveness
next time I see her.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.389
- No. Not next time.

28:45.466 --> 28:46.949
Now time, dude.

28:46.967 --> 28:48.225
(phone ringing)

28:48.376 --> 28:50.302
- Hello?
- Hey! It's Renwick.

28:50.378 --> 28:52.045
<i> I got someone here that</i>
<i> wants to talk to you.</i>

28:52.214 --> 28:55.482
<i> - A kid is missing, dude.</i>
<i> I don't have time for this.</i>
- Lord...

28:57.478 --> 28:58.627
<i> - Hi, June.</i>

28:58.629 --> 29:00.295
I know that I'm the last person
on Earth

29:00.314 --> 29:02.314
that you wanna speak to
right now.

29:02.390 --> 29:03.815
<i> But I need you to know</i>
<i> that I'm sorry.</i>

29:03.968 --> 29:06.726
<i> I never should've lied to you,</i>
<i> I should've been honest</i>

29:06.746 --> 29:08.653
about the fact that I wasn't
ready to have a child.

29:08.730 --> 29:11.064
I'm so sorry,
from the bottom of my heart.

29:11.141 --> 29:13.066
I am genuinely, genuinely sorry.

29:13.143 --> 29:14.234
<i> - So am I...</i>

29:14.311 --> 29:15.235
that you're only calling me

29:15.312 --> 29:16.478
because Ren put you up to it.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.071
- That's fair.
But truth be told,

29:18.090 --> 29:20.073
you won't take my calls.
I wanna speak to you.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.407
<i> I'm ready to speak to you.</i>

29:21.485 --> 29:23.318
- Well, there is something
I wanna tell you,

29:23.337 --> 29:25.095
but I don't want to do it
over the phone.

29:25.247 --> 29:26.913
<i> How about we meet tonight?</i>

29:26.932 --> 29:28.640
- Great. I'll be there.

29:29.994 --> 29:30.842
(sighing)

29:30.995 --> 29:32.252
- For the record,

29:32.329 --> 29:33.829
I'm rooting for you two.

29:33.922 --> 29:34.754
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

29:34.923 --> 29:36.848
- That's really nice.
Pacemaker?

29:37.001 --> 29:39.167
- Do you know the manufacturer?
- Lugenix.

29:39.169 --> 29:42.387
- Lugenix?
Their cloud security's a joke!

29:42.539 --> 29:44.339
They rolled their
own encryption

29:44.358 --> 29:47.526
and used a faulty
cipher feedback.

29:47.602 --> 29:49.602
- Can you find the pacemaker
in the next hour?

29:49.696 --> 29:51.513
- Bro... Five minutes. Tops.

29:51.698 --> 29:53.365
- Okay. Five minutes,
that's pretty good.

29:53.517 --> 29:55.275
- I told you,
he's a miracle worker.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.442
(phone ringing)
- Hey. Any luck?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.111
<i> - I've got a track</i>
<i> on Vicki Parsons.</i>

29:58.130 --> 30:00.038
She's headed north on route 611,

30:00.190 --> 30:02.299
heading towards Warrington.
<i> - I'll coordinate with P.S.P.</i>

30:02.376 --> 30:04.450
to set up a roadblock
at Danboro Bridge.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.594
I'll meet you there.

30:16.131 --> 30:17.648
- Are you thirsty?

30:18.317 --> 30:19.483
Okay, baby.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.985
Lemme know
if you change your mind.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.991
(sirens blaring)

30:39.897 --> 30:40.912
No...

30:40.989 --> 30:42.548
(tires screeching)

30:46.587 --> 30:48.920
- Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

30:48.997 --> 30:51.056
- No! No! No! No!

30:52.667 --> 30:54.667
Andy, listen to me.

30:54.745 --> 30:55.835
I know you're scared.

30:55.913 --> 30:58.230
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you.

30:58.932 --> 31:00.190
Mommy was sick.

31:00.267 --> 31:02.584
And I tried to get better
for you.

31:02.586 --> 31:03.768
So I could find you.

31:03.921 --> 31:06.438
I searched for so long, baby.

31:06.940 --> 31:09.032
So I could finally
be a mother to you.

31:09.109 --> 31:10.592
Do you understand?

31:10.685 --> 31:13.261
None of this is your fault.

31:13.764 --> 31:15.764
But I need you to take my hand.

31:15.766 --> 31:18.000
I need you to trust me.

31:21.696 --> 31:23.863
Everything's gonna be
okay from now on.

31:23.883 --> 31:27.092
Mama's finally gonna
take care of you.

31:27.794 --> 31:29.511
(sirens blaring)

31:32.299 --> 31:33.615
- No one approaches the vehicle.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.041
We got it from here, okay?

31:35.119 --> 31:38.186
- Come with me. Block out
this road. Nobody in or out.

31:43.977 --> 31:44.976
- Ms. Parsons.

31:45.129 --> 31:45.977
Vicki...

31:46.572 --> 31:49.055
Vicki, I'm gonna need you
to put down the gun

31:49.133 --> 31:50.482
and let Andy go, okay?

31:50.634 --> 31:52.134
- If I drop this gun,
I know what happens next.

31:52.152 --> 31:55.412
I go to jail and you give
my child back to that woman.

31:55.563 --> 31:57.806
- We know the truth, Vicki.
We know that Andy is your son.

31:57.808 --> 32:00.142
- What about Brad?
- Why don't we go down
to the station?

32:00.235 --> 32:01.993
We'll talk about Brad, okay?

32:02.070 --> 32:03.236
- He said he loved me...

32:03.313 --> 32:04.737
He said that we'd get Andy back.

32:04.739 --> 32:06.757
That we would all be together.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.759
I was stupid enough
to believe him.

32:08.910 --> 32:10.819
He just wanted Andy
for a payout.

32:10.837 --> 32:12.596
- And that's when you found him
at the park,

32:12.673 --> 32:14.598
you confronted him.
Right?

32:14.675 --> 32:15.933
<i> - We got into an argument.</i>

32:16.009 --> 32:18.326
<i> I wasn't gonna let him</i>
<i> give my son away.</i>

32:18.345 --> 32:20.228
He pulled the gun on me.

32:21.589 --> 32:23.523
<i> We struggled for it...</i>

32:24.851 --> 32:26.001
And I shot him.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.945
(gunshot)
<i> To protect Andy.</i>

32:28.021 --> 32:29.171
- Sounds to me
like self-defense.

32:29.189 --> 32:30.763
Maybe a judge will see it
the same way.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.858
- They'll charge me
with kidnapping my own son.

32:33.935 --> 32:35.601
My own child!

32:35.955 --> 32:38.479
I wasn't gonna let Brad
give my child back

32:38.481 --> 32:40.849
to the monster
that took him from me.

32:40.851 --> 32:43.443
And I sure as hell
won't let you.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.170
- Vicki, come on,
baby, please.

32:45.872 --> 32:47.297
No!

32:47.449 --> 32:48.674
(dramatic music)

32:49.951 --> 32:51.510
- No, Nick, hey!

33:11.473 --> 33:12.614
(gasping)

33:18.572 --> 33:20.580
(melancholic music)

33:24.578 --> 33:25.836
(door opening)

33:25.987 --> 33:27.153
- Andy?

33:27.172 --> 33:28.747
- He's fine. He's here.

33:29.324 --> 33:31.717
Sergeant Schultz
will take you to him.

33:32.494 --> 33:34.236
- Oh! You did it!

33:34.254 --> 33:36.680
You gave us a fairy tale ending.

33:37.499 --> 33:38.664
Thank you.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.684
- Of course. Now go.

33:43.430 --> 33:45.522
This isn't about the bridge,
is it?

33:45.599 --> 33:47.006
- I apologized to June.

33:47.084 --> 33:48.508
She's gonna meet me later.

33:49.419 --> 33:51.269
- I'm not surprised.
When you want to,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.255
you can be very not un-charming.

33:53.257 --> 33:55.440
- Ah. You're telling
the kids about Mike.

33:55.592 --> 33:57.942
I'm gonna have kids with
someone who's not their mother.

33:58.019 --> 33:59.995
Is that a fairy tale ending?

34:00.781 --> 34:02.039
- I want to see my family.

34:02.266 --> 34:03.022
- You can see Andy.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.115
- I want to see them both.

34:04.268 --> 34:05.691
- I've already explained
the situation.

34:05.711 --> 34:06.692
- The situation?

34:06.953 --> 34:08.937
That you're treating
my wife like a criminal.

34:08.955 --> 34:10.121
- No.
- Steve.

34:10.274 --> 34:12.507
- It's okay.
You can see them both.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.558
- I don't blame her
for not telling me.

34:21.709 --> 34:23.376
After what happened,
I don't think anyone could.

34:23.453 --> 34:26.805
She kept what she did
a secret to protect Andy.

34:26.957 --> 34:28.065
- And herself.

34:28.216 --> 34:29.791
She took him from his mother.

34:29.793 --> 34:31.793
- And because she did,
Andy has a stable home,

34:31.795 --> 34:34.296
two parents who love him and
an incredibly bright future.

34:34.314 --> 34:35.647
- We're going to write
a case report.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.241
And when we do, we're gonna have
to include all the facts.

34:38.318 --> 34:40.560
What Vicki Parsons did.
And what Pat did, too.

34:40.637 --> 34:41.803
Taking Andy.

34:41.805 --> 34:43.914
- Hey, why don't you go be with
your family.

34:43.990 --> 34:45.499
Alright? Go ahead.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.752
- You know if he's taken
from us,

34:48.829 --> 34:49.978
he has no one.

34:49.996 --> 34:51.479
Not even his crazy mother.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.548
Without us, he's alone.

34:57.003 --> 34:59.154
- He's right.
If we tell the truth,

34:59.156 --> 35:00.413
and nothing but the truth,

35:00.432 --> 35:03.082
the DCFS will take Andy
from him.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.601
He'll end up in foster care.

35:04.678 --> 35:07.512
- As opposed to ending up with
a woman who changed her identity

35:07.664 --> 35:09.773
to hide the fact that
she kidnapped a baby?

35:09.924 --> 35:11.015
- Well, she saved
that baby's life!

35:11.168 --> 35:12.425
- All I'm saying is
she committed a felony

35:12.444 --> 35:14.002
and we can't cover that up.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.021
- You know what, the report,
feel free to not assign it
to me.

35:17.174 --> 35:18.865
- I'll do it.

35:19.767 --> 35:21.618
- You sure? I can help you if...

35:21.769 --> 35:23.102
- It's okay. I got it.

35:23.438 --> 35:24.696
- Hey, I need you to take these.

35:24.848 --> 35:25.771
The candles and the yolks.

35:26.032 --> 35:28.125
- Oh, we're not doing
breakfast for dinner?

35:28.276 --> 35:29.609
- Give those to Sidney.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.444
It contains bad energy.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.855
Tell her to bury it
as far away as possible.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.948
- How bad is the energy?

35:36.135 --> 35:37.525
- It's something...

35:37.544 --> 35:39.118
...primal.

35:39.196 --> 35:40.303
- But you got them. Or it.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.472
- I won this battle, but...

35:43.142 --> 35:45.183
It's definitely a war.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.477
- Hey, J.

35:47.554 --> 35:49.312
This just came
for Captain Batista.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.273
- I'll give it to her.
Thank you.

36:06.573 --> 36:09.315
- That's it?
Outlaw couple tries to abduct

36:09.393 --> 36:11.351
wealthy family's child
for ransom.

36:11.353 --> 36:13.336
One kills the other,
then commits suicide.

36:13.413 --> 36:15.988
End of story.
- I know how you feel
about this.

36:16.066 --> 36:18.082
- This is not about how I feel.
This is about the facts.

36:18.235 --> 36:22.070
The ones any report
issued from this office
are obligated to include.

36:22.088 --> 36:24.589
- Are we obligated
to destroy Andy's life?

36:24.741 --> 36:27.184
Because that is what including
all the facts will do.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.093
- You don't know that.
- Kemi's right.

36:29.246 --> 36:31.712
If the DCFS finds out
all the facts,

36:31.714 --> 36:33.190
they will take Andy away.

36:33.417 --> 36:34.858
- This is not about
what the DCFS will do.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.918
This is about you
doing your job.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.679
Which last time I checked
did not include playing God.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.348
- That's not what I'm doing.
- You're right.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.276
Presumably, God would be
an excellent social worker,

36:45.429 --> 36:47.037
like, I don't know,
the people at DCFS

36:47.188 --> 36:49.597
who are actually equipped
to decide the fate of a child.

36:49.616 --> 36:52.042
- I feel perfectly equipped
to decide this child's fate.

36:52.193 --> 36:53.117
- I know you do.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.003
That's what frightens me.

36:57.607 --> 36:59.674
Are you really going
to send this in?

37:00.627 --> 37:02.177
- I already did.

37:07.634 --> 37:10.802
- I know we were supposed
to tell the kids about us
at dinner, but...

37:11.230 --> 37:13.230
I don't think I can be
with you tonight.

37:15.976 --> 37:17.525
- I understand.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.612
- It's him. It's Keith.

37:21.481 --> 37:24.157
DNA confirms, that's our boy.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.078
- I don't understand.

37:28.563 --> 37:30.472
- We took DNA
from his toothbrush

37:30.474 --> 37:31.748
and from his baby hair,

37:31.975 --> 37:35.568
from before he was taken
and then, after he came back.

37:35.587 --> 37:39.047
They match.
- He's your brother, butter.

37:40.984 --> 37:42.592
- Is that from Kemi?
How'd I do?

37:42.669 --> 37:44.594
- Apparently,
you're a work in progress.

37:44.821 --> 37:46.263
But this is a good first start

37:46.339 --> 37:48.323
if you can bury this
far, far away.

37:48.341 --> 37:50.492
I say the garbage disposal
is good enough.

37:50.494 --> 37:51.935
- You owe Kemi
more respect than that.

37:52.086 --> 37:54.437
You need to respect her,
respect her process.

37:54.664 --> 37:56.014
- Okay. That's fair.

37:56.166 --> 37:57.941
But this process, this DNA,

37:58.092 --> 38:00.259
okay, this is undeniable,
verifiable,

38:00.337 --> 38:03.021
no egg yolk necessary,

38:03.115 --> 38:05.840
super mo in the mojo.

38:06.343 --> 38:08.100
- You're right. About Kemi.

38:08.695 --> 38:11.329
I need to respect her.
- This is good news.

38:12.365 --> 38:14.440
- Yeah, Keith,
he's got good mojo.

38:14.518 --> 38:17.669
Me, I've got candle wax
and runny eggs.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.705
And limes... to protect me.

38:20.782 --> 38:23.115
- You do not need protection.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.950
- Yeah, I do.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.511
We all do.

38:27.622 --> 38:30.140
- Sid. Sidney. Sid...

38:30.291 --> 38:32.124
Well, I guess,
the good news is

38:32.144 --> 38:34.052
no one has to eat
your meatloaf. Huh?

38:34.128 --> 38:35.386
- I thought you loved
my meatloaf.

38:35.463 --> 38:36.479
Then again,
June thought that

38:36.631 --> 38:38.373
you were trying
to get her pregnant.

38:38.391 --> 38:40.692
You know, I am sensing
a theme here.

38:41.561 --> 38:42.986
- The report...

38:43.063 --> 38:44.303
You did the right thing.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.156
- Thank you.
What can I say,

38:46.307 --> 38:47.991
I love a fairy tale ending.

38:48.176 --> 38:50.493
- You'll get your own fairy tale
ending with Mike too.

38:50.645 --> 38:53.705
You also can be not un-charming
when you wanna be.

38:55.650 --> 38:57.408
- Why is this so hard?

38:58.003 --> 39:00.152
- Well, I think, because...

39:00.230 --> 39:03.965
grief is the price
we pay for love.

39:04.734 --> 39:05.842
- Go. Be with June.

39:05.993 --> 39:08.570
- You sure?
- Yeah. Positive. Positive. Yes.

39:09.756 --> 39:13.558
This day has to end with
a fairy tale ending for someone.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.731
(soft music)

39:26.756 --> 39:27.847
- You didn't believe me?

39:27.924 --> 39:29.199
(tense music)

39:30.093 --> 39:31.593
- Oh...

39:31.903 --> 39:33.352
You heard us talking.

39:34.097 --> 39:36.498
- I can't believe you thought
I was an imposter.

39:40.937 --> 39:43.129
- Baby... Keith!

39:44.049 --> 39:45.507
(door closing)

39:48.053 --> 39:49.969
- Thanks for having me over.

39:50.463 --> 39:51.721
How's Carol?

39:51.873 --> 39:52.947
- Upstairs.

39:52.966 --> 39:54.707
Which is why we're meeting here.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.059
Your sister hates me that much?

39:56.136 --> 39:59.729
- I'm 42, and because of you,
I'm living here, so...

39:59.806 --> 40:01.389
You do the math.

40:02.049 --> 40:03.483
- I've done the math.

40:04.385 --> 40:07.570
And I want us to get pregnant.

40:08.148 --> 40:09.313
The sooner the better.

40:09.816 --> 40:11.908
Okay? What is it?
You don't believe me?

40:12.318 --> 40:14.393
- No, I... Oh, my God.

40:14.471 --> 40:17.038
I do believe you, it's just...

40:18.065 --> 40:19.490
There is someone else.

40:19.976 --> 40:21.084
- There's... Wow.

40:21.161 --> 40:23.494
You moved out a week ago.

40:23.647 --> 40:25.738
- Yeah, he's amazing.

40:26.316 --> 40:27.907
He's a neurosurgeon.

40:27.984 --> 40:29.500
Uh, and...

40:29.653 --> 40:30.743
He likes to cook.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.745
And he backpacks.
- Okay.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.265
Are you dating him
or are you building a monument?

40:35.416 --> 40:37.659
(chuckling)
- No, no. I'm not dating him.

40:37.677 --> 40:41.179
I've actually never met him.
And I'm never going to meet him.

40:41.331 --> 40:44.666
But I am going
to have his child.

40:44.668 --> 40:46.184
- Immaculate conception.

40:46.519 --> 40:47.444
Cue the wise men.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.261
- Or in this case
the sperm bank.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.598
- No, June, don't do that.
I'm right here.

40:52.676 --> 40:54.266
I want this. Okay?

40:54.286 --> 40:55.935
Look at me, I want this.

40:56.863 --> 41:00.957
- I want to thank you for
being incredibly irresponsible,

41:01.034 --> 41:03.685
because you taught me
to look out for myself.

41:03.778 --> 41:04.944
So...

41:04.963 --> 41:06.713
...that's what I did.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.199
- He rigged it.
<i> - A DNA test?</i>

41:18.292 --> 41:19.367
<i> That's impossible.</i>

41:19.385 --> 41:20.551
- So is the result.

41:20.628 --> 41:22.887
And before you say that maybe
we're wrong,

41:22.964 --> 41:24.129
please don't.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.891
Because the alternative
is too horrible to contemplate.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.467
<i> - So what're you gonna do?</i>

41:28.487 --> 41:30.686
- Well, I'm gonna
protect myself.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.239
And then I'm gonna
tell the truth.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.496
(dramatic music)

41:45.228 --> 41:48.129
(breathing heavily)

41:55.347 --> 41:57.347
(♪♪)

41:58.575 --> 42:01.059
<i> - 911, what's the nature</i>
<i> of your emergency?</i>

42:02.929 --> 42:04.187
- There was a drowning.

42:04.581 --> 42:06.931
<i> - Is the person under water?</i>
<i> Are you unable to see them?</i>

42:07.008 --> 42:08.432
- Yeah. That's right.

42:09.269 --> 42:11.653
There's a body at the bottom
of Union Lake.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.765
Subtitling: difuze
