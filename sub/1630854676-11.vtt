02:25.833 --> 02:27.041
Welcome, Doctor.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.916
All preparations have been made
for your arrival.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.125
I would hope so.

02:33.041 --> 02:35.791
Notify me
once our remaining vessels arrive,

02:35.791 --> 02:38.000
and see to the transfer of the assets.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.875
Have the cargo taken below.

03:09.916 --> 03:13.458
It's been a long time, Mistress Se.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.916
Indeed, Dr. Hemlock.

03:19.916 --> 03:22.166
How it pains me to see you like this.

03:23.833 --> 03:29.125
Why does someone so talented prefer to rot
in a cell instead of using their gifts

03:29.125 --> 03:30.875
to better the galaxy?

03:31.958 --> 03:36.416
I am not especially motivated
to continue my work

03:36.416 --> 03:41.208
after the Empire
destroyed my civilization.

03:41.916 --> 03:44.125
What was done on Kamino was unfortunate,

03:44.125 --> 03:48.125
but know that
your research remains intact.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.833
It'll now serve a higher purpose.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.041
The Emperor's purpose.

04:00.250 --> 04:04.000
Don't you wish to be a part of
such a scientific achievement?

04:05.625 --> 04:09.625
I know what Emperor Palpatine seeks
to accomplish,

04:10.625 --> 04:14.375
and he will not have my cooperation.

04:15.916 --> 04:18.666
Perhaps you require the right incentive.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.833
Know that I'll be taking over
operations here on Tantiss,

04:22.833 --> 04:25.958
and I can do far worse
than confine you to a cell.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.541
And I'll let you think on that.

04:33.958 --> 04:34.958
Doctor.

04:37.625 --> 04:41.708
We lost communication with transport 904.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.750
Have the recovery teams begin a search.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.583
We need that asset contained.

04:47.708 --> 04:52.041
And, Emerie, were there
any other Kaminoans taken off-world

04:52.041 --> 04:54.458
prior to the destruction of Tipoca City?

04:55.583 --> 04:56.833
Their prime minister.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.875
He remains in Imperial custody
on Coruscant.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.833
Have him brought here.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.750
I wish to speak to him personally.

05:23.416 --> 05:26.958
<i>Not sure
what's got you all twisted up in knots.</i>

05:26.958 --> 05:29.208
We were stranded on that planet, Cid.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.541
We needed you, and you left us.

05:32.166 --> 05:36.458
<i>You're fine now, aren't you?
And you got your ship back.</i>

05:36.458 --> 05:38.375
Yeah, with no help from you.

05:38.375 --> 05:41.416
<i>Do you wanna mope or make money?</i>

05:41.416 --> 05:44.666
<i>Because I got a tip on a downed ship,</i>

05:44.666 --> 05:47.791
<i>which means cargo ripe for the taking.</i>

05:47.791 --> 05:49.875
<i>I'll even give you 30% of the cut.</i>

05:49.875 --> 05:52.875
That is our standard percentage.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.375
<i>All right.</i>

05:54.375 --> 05:58.458
<i>This one time, let's say 35%.</i>

06:01.250 --> 06:02.500
<i>Okay, 40.</i>

06:04.875 --> 06:10.416
<i>Fine, 50% as a token of my goodwill,</i>

06:10.416 --> 06:12.583
<i>that you seem to have forgotten.</i>

06:13.166 --> 06:15.208
<i>I'm sending you the intel now.</i>

06:15.208 --> 06:19.250
<i>Don't come back
unless you scavenge something valuable.</i>

06:19.250 --> 06:21.708
What makes you think
we'd come back at all?

06:21.708 --> 06:23.833
<i>Don't test me, Bandana.</i>

06:23.833 --> 06:25.291
<i>Just get it done.</i>

06:26.916 --> 06:29.541
Severing ties with Cid
could be problematic,

06:29.541 --> 06:31.541
considering what she knows about us.

06:31.541 --> 06:34.041
Perhaps we choose a diplomatic solution

06:34.041 --> 06:36.541
and complete this
one last mission for her.

06:36.541 --> 06:38.291
Cid only sent coordinates.

06:38.791 --> 06:42.666
No ship transponder code
or indication of what caused it to crash.

06:43.666 --> 06:47.416
Limited intel. Huh. There's a surprise.

06:47.416 --> 06:50.291
How hard could scavenging cargo be?

07:13.916 --> 07:15.625
There's a village here.

07:15.625 --> 07:19.166
That would explain how
the wreckage was reported so quickly.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.583
The crashed vessel appears mostly intact.

07:21.583 --> 07:25.041
The cargo aboard should be
in fair enough condition to transport.

08:17.916 --> 08:19.916
What kind of ship is this?

08:19.916 --> 08:22.500
Don't know. No hull markings.

08:22.500 --> 08:27.083
Based on the severity of the impact
and the lack of communication signals,

08:27.083 --> 08:29.041
the crew aboard most likely perished.

08:29.666 --> 08:32.708
We don't know for sure.
They could be trapped inside.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.583
Come on.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.875
Where is everyone?

09:21.166 --> 09:23.833
Oh, check it out.

09:23.833 --> 09:26.416
High-volt electrostaff.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.708
Something unfortunate happened here.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.083
Whatever did this wasn't human.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.583
I will get the power restored
and check data logs on the bridge.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.250
By yourself?

09:41.250 --> 09:44.416
Your concern is not warranted.
I will be fine.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.000
Why is it so cold in here?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.458
It's some kind of lab.

11:13.583 --> 11:16.583
This medical equipment is Kaminoan.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.000
Huh. So, what's it doing here?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.916
It's their cloning technology,

11:21.916 --> 11:26.083
but this configuration is different
than anything I saw in Tipoca City.

11:27.666 --> 11:30.750
Tech, find anything on the bridge?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.000
Not yet.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.750
Still rerouting the reserve power.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.000
Stand by.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.875
The grid should be restored momentarily.

11:58.375 --> 12:02.250
Danger, danger, danger, danger.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.833
What happened?
What attacked this ship?

12:04.833 --> 12:07.625
Danger.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.041
These are reinforced walls.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.625
What were they keeping in here?

12:34.083 --> 12:38.250
I don't know,
but it's still on board.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.125
Hunter, what is that?

13:13.125 --> 13:16.541
Back away slowly.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.916
Tech, we've got a problem.
Get off the ship. Now!

14:29.833 --> 14:32.125
I suspect this is some type
of research vessel.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.375
We know!

14:33.375 --> 14:36.041
And whatever
they were researching just got loose.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.708
And it's headed your way.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.250
Does that thing look different to you?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.291
Fascinating.

15:06.416 --> 15:07.791
Take cover.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.916
The creature appears to be headed
in the direction of the village.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.708
We're the ones who let it out.

15:33.708 --> 15:35.875
We have to neutralize it
before it hurts anyone.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.541
How?
Our blasters are useless on it.

15:38.541 --> 15:42.041
Given the fact that the crew was
most likely eaten by the creature,

15:42.041 --> 15:44.916
- I doubt it is currently hungry--
- It ate the crew?

15:44.916 --> 15:46.916
How is that helping, Tech?

15:46.916 --> 15:48.833
It ate the crew.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.291
Access the lab files,

15:50.291 --> 15:53.666
and find out what species
we're dealing with and how to stop it.

15:53.666 --> 15:54.958
Mmm, I can help.

15:55.666 --> 15:58.208
- I know my way around Kaminoan tech.
- Go.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.416
Wrecker, with me.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.583
See anything?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.083
Zero, two, five.

16:35.541 --> 16:37.458
Whoa!

16:40.375 --> 16:41.666
<i>Did you get it?</i>

16:41.666 --> 16:44.291
No.

16:50.958 --> 16:54.291
This data is highly encrypted,
even within the ship's own system.

16:54.791 --> 16:55.791
Start here.

16:55.791 --> 16:58.916
This is used to extract and manipulate
a host's genetic material.

16:58.916 --> 17:01.000
You are familiar
with this type of cloning?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.541
Not exactly.

17:02.541 --> 17:05.208
I heard rumors
of other Kaminoan experiments,

17:05.208 --> 17:08.083
but Nala Se kept that data away from me.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.208
I think whatever they were doing
was happening off-world.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.333
Look at this.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.583
These appear to be designs
using the creature's genetic material

17:43.583 --> 17:45.416
for modified armor plating.

17:45.416 --> 17:48.500
That must be why it was unaffected
by our blaster fire.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.166
Then how do we stop it?

17:50.166 --> 17:51.458
Uncertain.

17:51.458 --> 17:55.250
However, this confirms
that the species feeds on energy,

17:55.250 --> 17:57.125
which propels its rapid growth.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.208
You mean it'll get even bigger?

17:59.875 --> 18:02.625
Yes. Much bigger.

18:07.458 --> 18:10.208
<i>Hunter,
the creature is the same species</i>

18:10.208 --> 18:12.125
<i>that attacked Coruscant during the war.</i>

18:12.125 --> 18:14.833
<i>You must not let it get
near the power grid,</i>

18:14.833 --> 18:17.416
<i>or it will increase exponentially in size.</i>

18:22.916 --> 18:24.000
Too late.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.666
Stop it before it gets any larger.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.625
I'm trying!

19:14.291 --> 19:15.541
We've got ships on our tail.

19:20.583 --> 19:21.958
Where'd they come from?

19:24.666 --> 19:25.958
Hold on.

19:30.666 --> 19:33.291
<i>Tech, Omega,
you've got Imperials inbound.</i>

19:33.291 --> 19:34.375
<i>Get out of there.</i>

19:34.375 --> 19:35.458
On our way.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.875
Tech, let's go.

19:36.875 --> 19:40.291
Not yet. I am not finished transferring
all of the data.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.083
Come on.

21:03.375 --> 21:04.875
They're not killing it.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.083
They're taking it.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.458
Let's not be next.

21:28.541 --> 21:31.333
Hunter, we are clear of the vessel
and heading to the landing zone.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.708
<i>Copy that.</i>

23:15.500 --> 23:18.875
The crashed vessel was part of
an Imperial cloning operation.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.875
The Empire cloned the Zillo Beast?

23:21.875 --> 23:23.583
Yes and no.

23:23.583 --> 23:26.125
The directive came
straight from the Supreme Chancellor

23:26.125 --> 23:28.333
before he became Emperor.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.666
What's he want with it?

23:29.666 --> 23:33.458
The creature's genetic material
has the potential to be weaponized

23:33.458 --> 23:35.541
in the hands of the right scientist.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.375
Where were they taking the creature?

23:37.375 --> 23:38.458
Unknown.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.625
The ship did not have
a destination logged.

23:41.666 --> 23:44.958
Hunter, there is far more to this
than we realized.

23:45.666 --> 23:47.208
From what I have gathered,

23:47.208 --> 23:51.958
I suspect the Empire did not destroy
the cities on Kamino to end cloning.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.416
They merely wanted to control it.

24:01.291 --> 24:05.583
Send the data to Echo and Rex.
See what they can find out.

24:25.458 --> 24:26.625
Doctor.

24:26.625 --> 24:30.875
The creature has been recovered
and is now safely secured below.

24:30.875 --> 24:31.958
Good.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.875
And our other guest?

24:33.875 --> 24:35.541
The shuttle is arriving now.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.958
Did any of the villagers see the Zillo?

24:48.458 --> 24:49.625
Several.

24:49.625 --> 24:52.333
The locals have been detained
and will be dealt with.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.916
However, one vessel escaped our assault.

24:54.916 --> 24:56.875
It was a military-class shuttle.

24:59.375 --> 25:00.666
Find out who it was.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.166
Yes, sir.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.833
Hello, Prime Minister.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.333
Apologies. Former Prime Minister.

25:20.916 --> 25:23.083
Why have I been brought here?

25:24.083 --> 25:28.833
The cooperation of your chief scientist
has not been forthcoming.

25:29.833 --> 25:33.958
Nala Se's defiance is problematic.

25:35.083 --> 25:38.500
It must be frustrating
to have your resources

25:38.500 --> 25:42.250
but lack the expertise
to achieve your goals.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.041
And if you fail to convince her,

25:45.041 --> 25:49.625
it won't be long
before you are in a cell like me.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.208
Hmm.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.875
I fear you misunderstand
your situation here.

25:55.791 --> 25:58.583
If you know of a way
to persuade the scientist,

25:58.583 --> 26:00.708
now would be the time to mention it.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.416
Indeed.

26:02.416 --> 26:04.875
In exchange for my freedom.

26:06.166 --> 26:07.208
I'm listening.

26:07.708 --> 26:10.750
There is a particular clone
you must locate.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.583
A young girl.

26:12.583 --> 26:15.791
She is the key to controlling Nala Se.

26:16.791 --> 26:19.333
How very interesting.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.250
It seems we have much to discuss.
