00:08.758 --> 00:09.883
Hey, Eddie. Aah!

00:12.095 --> 00:14.388
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.349
Why?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.560
It makes me feel, um, peaceful.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.395
Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.522
I can't sleep now!

00:23.690 --> 00:24.898
Oh, you want me to sing?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.526
No. Look.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.030
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

00:31.197 --> 00:33.282
Oh, what are you talking about?

00:33.450 --> 00:34.825
Hannibal Lecter?

00:36.369 --> 00:37.619
Better roommate than you.

00:37.787 --> 00:38.829
No.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.875
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me, you get scared.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.003
What about the other nights
when you don't see me, huh?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.964
Last night you went
and got some water...

00:49.215 --> 00:52.634
...and I was nice enough to hide
behind the door. What that about, huh?

00:53.053 --> 00:55.179
- I didn't realize that.
- Ah.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.473
Get out now!

00:57.640 --> 01:00.225
Okay. You really want me out?

01:00.393 --> 01:01.477
Yes, please.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.313
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.773
I want you out.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.649
I want to hear it from your lips.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.569
Where'd you hear it before?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.822
Oh, right, all right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.326
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.871
- Thank you.
- I heard that.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.466
- Thanks.
- Hey.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.717
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.427
Well, look at you!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.471
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.099
You like it?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.977
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

02:25.228 --> 02:28.105
- "You know what I don't have?"
- A mirror?

02:29.274 --> 02:32.025
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.947
Wow! For a guy who's recently lost
his job, you're in a good mood.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.284
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.954
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of our Lives.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.957
Huh? That's got to have
some kind of cachet.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.169
Cachet? Jaunty?

02:50.336 --> 02:53.255
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.675
I'm gonna get some coffee.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.680
Oh! So? Did you read the book?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.099
Oh, my God. It was incredible!

03:04.267 --> 03:05.809
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?

03:05.977 --> 03:08.020
- Whoa, whoa, what book is this?
- Oh.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.899
Uh! You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.985
Ooh. It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.654
And, oh! But there's wind.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.075
And the wind can make us goddesses.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.120
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.583
Men just take our wind?

03:29.792 --> 03:33.754
Uh-huh. All the time.
Because they are the lightning-bearers.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.757
- Wow.
- Yeah.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.718
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.095
It is nothing like The Hobbit.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.974
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.476
Except for Richard.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.645
Oh, yes. No.
Richard would never steal your wind.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.230
- No.
- No.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.815
- Because he's yummy.
- Yes.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.150
But all the other ones.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.195
Oh, and the part about how
they're always drinking...

03:58.404 --> 04:00.280
...from our pool of inner power.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.741
But God forbid we should take a sip.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.117
Anybody want a cruller?

04:04.285 --> 04:07.704
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.539
Right there. It's like, um...

04:09.707 --> 04:13.418
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

04:21.052 --> 04:24.096
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.309
So you're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.728
Joey, look at me.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.730
Look at me!

04:35.483 --> 04:37.901
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

04:40.905 --> 04:41.989
No.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.448
Uh, can we get back to me?

04:43.616 --> 04:47.744
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.914
I already got you an audition
for Another World.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.499
All right!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.252
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.129
You're welcome.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.300
But... But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

05:01.467 --> 05:05.012
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

05:05.263 --> 05:08.682
Things change. Roll with them.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.184
But this is a two-line part!

05:11.436 --> 05:13.562
It's like taking a step backwards.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.647
I'm not gonna do this.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.483
Joey.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.653
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

05:21.821 --> 05:24.197
...and his pyramid of dogs.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.869
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.414
I'm sorry.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.082
I'll see you.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.878
Uh, God!

05:38.379 --> 05:40.464
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...

05:40.715 --> 05:41.923
Isn't it?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.218
Uh. This is like reading
about my own life!

05:45.386 --> 05:49.264
This book could have been called
Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!

05:50.183 --> 05:52.142
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.519
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.938
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.149
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.400
No!

06:02.528 --> 06:03.737
No? Heh.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.784
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

06:08.951 --> 06:12.245
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.915
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

06:16.584 --> 06:21.380
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.008
You go, girl!

06:27.929 --> 06:30.138
I can't pull that off, can I?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.935
Excuse me, your wind?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.603
Yes, my wind.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.648
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

06:46.864 --> 06:48.907
You know I don't...

06:51.494 --> 06:53.703
...have a problem with that.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.213
Okay.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.427
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.595
I'm sorry.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.140
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Uh, you're right.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.683
I don't have to apologize.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.185
Sorry. Damn it!

07:23.901 --> 07:25.485
- What is it?
- I don't know.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.530
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

07:28.698 --> 07:30.282
...and some sacred pool.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.743
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.746
This is why I don't date
women who read.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.541
Uh-oh.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.042
What? What's that?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.378
It's my VISA bill.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.881
Envelope one of two.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.760
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.016
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

07:56.184 --> 07:58.268
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

07:58.436 --> 08:02.606
Uh, that's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.608
Aah!

08:04.775 --> 08:09.196
Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.780
My animals.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.160
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.828
Oh.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.663
I don't know what to do!

08:18.915 --> 08:21.833
You can start by driving a cab
on Another World.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.793
- What?
- That audition?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.754
That's a two-line part!

08:25.922 --> 08:30.091
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite."

08:30.259 --> 08:32.635
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.386
It's a job. It's money.

08:34.554 --> 08:38.433
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.020
- Toilet paper?
- Yeah.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.900
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.986
- You're supposed to be my friend!
- I am your friend.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.239
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

08:52.490 --> 08:55.659
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

08:55.826 --> 08:57.160
But I don't know it.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.872
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

09:02.416 --> 09:04.292
I'm aware of what I owe.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.296
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.341
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

09:11.509 --> 09:12.592
I'm just saying...

09:12.802 --> 09:14.928
Well, don't "just say"!

09:16.681 --> 09:18.848
Oh. Maybe I should just go.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.685
Okay.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.395
I'll see you later.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.314
Just think about it.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.400
I don't need to think about it!

09:28.651 --> 09:30.860
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

09:31.112 --> 09:32.904
That was huge!

09:33.197 --> 09:35.615
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

09:35.825 --> 09:36.908
Ross!

09:37.451 --> 09:38.952
You still there?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.465
- Hey, pal.
- Oh, God!

09:54.343 --> 09:55.844
What are you still doing here?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.972
Uh, just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.683
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

10:02.893 --> 10:04.769
Aren't you forgetting anything?

10:04.937 --> 10:07.105
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.232
He's feistier than the last one.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.527
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.741
Eddie, isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing now?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.410
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.412
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

10:26.334 --> 10:27.876
I thought we had a deal.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.711
- I thought by the time I got...
- Uh, uh.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.004
You know what that is?

10:31.756 --> 10:32.922
Your last roommate's kidney?

10:34.925 --> 10:36.676
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.762
This one definitely goes in the display.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.100
It's in the display.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.775
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.360
Lemonade?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.070
You okay, man?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.572
Ahh, it's career stuff.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.492
They killed off
my character on the show.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.411
Oh, that's too bad.
How'd they do it?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.538
I fell down an elevator shaft.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.874
Oh. That sucks.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.751
I was buried in an avalanche.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.379
What?

11:12.546 --> 11:15.131
I used to be Brice on All My Children.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.738
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

11:39.281 --> 11:41.616
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

11:41.784 --> 11:42.867
...watching!
- I...

11:43.077 --> 11:44.369
Neh.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.711
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.423
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.676
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

12:01.303 --> 12:02.929
- What?
- You! Move out!

12:03.180 --> 12:07.267
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

12:07.435 --> 12:09.436
You want me to move out? Uh...

12:13.274 --> 12:15.150
Uh-huh.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.694
Heh. I, uh...

12:17.903 --> 12:22.198
Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind
of out of the blue, don't you think?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.201
This is not out of the blue!

12:25.453 --> 12:27.579
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

12:27.955 --> 12:29.414
Whoa!

12:30.124 --> 12:32.083
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

12:32.334 --> 12:34.085
You don't have to tell me twice.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.714
God, I mean, someone will be by
for my stuff.

12:42.803 --> 12:46.222
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

12:47.516 --> 12:48.600
You want some help?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.685
No help required, chico!

12:59.403 --> 13:02.739
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.242
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.661
Excuse me, that's "50" bucks.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.832
- What?
- Five-O dollars.

13:13.042 --> 13:17.712
Oh. You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.840
When I was on Days of our Lives
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

13:21.884 --> 13:24.344
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.430
Ha, ha. That's great.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.684
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

13:31.894 --> 13:33.770
...I could attend to the victims...

13:33.979 --> 13:36.064
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.275
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

13:39.443 --> 13:43.655
No. Uh, don't thank me for coming in.
Uh, at least let me finish.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.993
Uh, we could take the expressway...

13:49.161 --> 13:53.665
...but, uh, this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.546
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

14:00.548 --> 14:01.631
I'll have a good day.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.471
Okay, question number 28.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.767
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

14:13.561 --> 14:15.270
I would have to say no.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.524
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha."

14:20.568 --> 14:21.651
What?

14:21.819 --> 14:23.570
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

14:23.737 --> 14:28.741
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.995
And his puppet too!

14:32.162 --> 14:34.372
Well, at least I didn't let some guy...

14:34.623 --> 14:37.500
...into the forest of my righteous truth
on the first date!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.214
- Who?
- Paul!

14:43.424 --> 14:44.799
Oh!

14:45.009 --> 14:48.177
Okay, okay, moving on, moving on.
Next question.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.888
Okay, number 29.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.057
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

14:53.309 --> 14:56.227
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.817
Not, uh...

15:02.985 --> 15:05.236
Ahem. Not to my recollection.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.073
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.868
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.787
Only because you took up
half the circle!

15:18.626 --> 15:21.210
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.503
Oh!

15:22.671 --> 15:24.923
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.466
Mm.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.719
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason...

15:29.887 --> 15:32.639
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.100
One hour?

15:36.268 --> 15:39.687
- You are such a leaf blower!
- Oh!

15:41.315 --> 15:42.857
Ugh!

15:44.902 --> 15:46.152
Ugh.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.578
Oh, hey, uh,
be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.539
Judas is a little loose.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.796
Oh, my God! What's going on?

16:06.256 --> 16:09.258
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.595
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

16:13.681 --> 16:17.266
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

16:17.434 --> 16:21.187
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

16:21.438 --> 16:25.775
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.735
And that's amazing to me.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.238
I could never do what you do.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.908
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.202
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

16:36.412 --> 16:39.330
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.165
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.710
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

16:43.877 --> 16:45.128
You're living the dream!

16:45.337 --> 16:46.796
- Huh?
- Ha, ha.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.840
All right, then!

16:50.300 --> 16:51.926
- Oh, not my parrot.
- What?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.929
I can't watch this.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.640
Hey, hold on, hold on.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.894
How much for the, uh?
How much to save the bird?

17:02.479 --> 17:03.938
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.898
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

17:07.108 --> 17:10.069
Uh, it was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.989
Go ahead with the bird.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.535
- Do you have anything for around $200?
- Uh.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.203
The dog.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.705
- Huh?
- Yeah.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.791
I'll take it.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.711
My gift to you, man.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.381
Thanks, Ross!

17:30.591 --> 17:32.675
I really liked that bird, though.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.928
- But the dog! Oh!
- Yeah. Right?

17:44.438 --> 17:45.813
Here are your cakes.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.315
We didn't order cake.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.610
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.154
You guys, this is not good.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.865
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

17:56.075 --> 17:58.159
...without taking it from each other.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.203
- You're right.
- You know?

18:01.121 --> 18:02.663
I love you goddesses.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.249
I love you.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.168
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.836
Oh.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.464
- Thank you. So are we good?
- Oh. We're good.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.757
- We're good?
- Yes.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.469
Okay. Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.682
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

18:26.271 --> 18:27.939
- Are you sure this time?
- Yes.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.024
I actually saw him leave.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.610
That guy is holding a human head.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.446
He's holding a human head!

18:37.908 --> 18:38.991
Check it out, man!

18:39.243 --> 18:42.328
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.871
There is no alley behind Macy's.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.541
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.461
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece
at our next cocktail party, huh?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.547
"Our next cocktail party"?

18:52.714 --> 18:56.717
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.390
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.684
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

19:09.022 --> 19:12.900
Ahem. Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.277
Uh, yes.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.658
So, what happened?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.869
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.954
Oh, sweet Moses!

19:26.540 --> 19:29.167
So on this road trip,
uh, did you win any money?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.587
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

19:32.754 --> 19:35.089
$300! He buys me these new shoes.
Sweet, huh?

19:35.632 --> 19:36.757
Nice.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.051
Uh, see you upstairs. See you, pals!

19:43.056 --> 19:44.974
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

20:05.746 --> 20:06.829
May I help you?

20:08.290 --> 20:11.334
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.378
I'm sorry. Aah.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.297
Have we met?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.799
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.385
I'm sorry, I, uh...

20:22.137 --> 20:24.388
...I already have a roommate.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.725
Hello.

20:30.979 --> 20:35.942
Um, he's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.985
No, no. He's, uh...

20:38.654 --> 20:42.240
No, he moved out and I moved in.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.701
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.455
I know I would. Ha, ha.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.375
That's, uh, a good point. Um...

20:52.960 --> 20:54.043
Okay, wow. Huh.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.504
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.548
Look, I'm...

20:59.716 --> 21:02.009
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.386
See you.

21:09.726 --> 21:13.229
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

21:14.731 --> 21:18.609
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh...

21:18.819 --> 21:22.488
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.408
I mean, I do have to, but...

21:25.659 --> 21:28.786
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

21:29.037 --> 21:30.788
I mean, this is...

21:32.165 --> 21:33.708
Welcome home, man.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.678
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

21:48.265 --> 21:50.057
What happened to the foosball?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.184
It's a cantaloupe.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.234
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

22:00.402 --> 22:01.986
He paid a lot of money for it.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.037
- I'm gonna hold him a different way.
- All right.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.958
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

22:16.209 --> 22:20.046
Well, I had a whole ceramic-zoo thing
going over there.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.715
But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.219
Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

22:28.138 --> 22:29.221
Stay.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.058
Uh, stay!

22:32.559 --> 22:34.435
Good fake dog.
