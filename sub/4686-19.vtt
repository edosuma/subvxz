WEBVTT

00:00.461 --> 00:01.572
So here's what you missed
on Glee.

00:01.585 --> 00:03.453
Rachel's a hit in Funny Girl
on Broadway,

00:03.487 --> 00:05.488
but she's on thin ice
because she lied to producers

00:05.522 --> 00:06.955
and missed a performance.

00:06.990 --> 00:09.390
Mercedes is finishing her album
with a duet with Santana

00:09.393 --> 00:11.527
and Blaine's getting wooed
by a rich society dame

00:11.562 --> 00:12.962
who's dying to showcase
his talent.

00:12.996 --> 00:14.864
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

00:14.898 --> 00:17.033
And all Kurt's got is NYADA
and the diner

00:17.067 --> 00:18.468
and his precious collection
of neckerchiefs.

00:18.502 --> 00:20.203
And that's what you missed
on Glee.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.925
Hey, do any of you guys
want to catch a matinee tomorrow?

00:25.959 --> 00:28.928
I have a late shift at the diner
and I know Funny Girl is dark.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.830
Uh, "dark" as in
there are no performances,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.665
or "dark" as in it's
kind of a downer.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.867
Oh, my word. I'm
sorry, I-I would love to go,

00:34.901 --> 00:36.935
but June's got me taken up with
dinners and rehearsals...

00:36.969 --> 00:40.072
Yeah, I know. Count me out.
I'm gonna be at recording studio all day.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.340
This is terrible... look what I
just found on Broadwaybuzzard.com.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.409
I'll take that.

00:44.444 --> 00:47.913
"Blind Item!
Liar, Liar Fanny on Fire!

00:47.947 --> 00:49.748
- Shh.
- "What Broadway starlet

00:49.782 --> 00:51.049
"has been calling in sick

00:51.084 --> 00:53.251
"while secretly pursuing
other job opportunities?

00:53.286 --> 00:56.455
"Unnamed sources say
producers are none too happy

00:56.489 --> 00:58.590
"with the burgeoning diva's
shenanigans,

00:58.624 --> 01:01.226
"and wager that this starlet
will burn out faster

01:01.260 --> 01:03.729
"than you can say
'Milwaukee Dinner Theatre

01:03.763 --> 01:06.164
in the Round!'"
I missed one show.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.632
Rachel, you should
actually be glad

01:07.667 --> 01:09.334
that they don't know
you're seriously considering

01:09.369 --> 01:11.269
leaving your show
to do a TV pilot.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.704
This is terrible, okay?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.539
I cannot be branded
a problem child

01:14.574 --> 01:16.775
this early in my career.
I-I might be ambitious,

01:16.809 --> 01:18.243
but I'm not a bad person.

01:18.277 --> 01:22.447
You can't expect total strangers
to know exactly who you are.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.449
I mean, look at Angelina
Jolie... she used to be

01:24.484 --> 01:26.885
that girl with the vial of blood
around her neck

01:26.919 --> 01:29.354
who liked kissing her brother,
and now she's mother earth.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.956
How'd she do it?

01:30.990 --> 01:33.759
Two things...
publicist and a cause.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.861
She can't afford a publicist.
And I've always been my cause.

01:35.895 --> 01:37.129
Inside voice, honey.
Sorry.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.263
Well, you don't need a publicist

01:38.297 --> 01:39.598
when you've got Snixx
on your side.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.033
If there's one thing
I know about,

01:41.067 --> 01:42.768
it's cultivating an image.
In high school,

01:42.802 --> 01:45.203
I was a huge bitch,
but also most popular.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.339
I was voted
Best Shoulder to Cry On

01:47.373 --> 01:50.275
and Most Likely to Poison Someone.
Excuse me.

01:51.577 --> 01:53.712
Excuse me, miss,

01:53.746 --> 01:56.315
I know that you have
a dog in your purse.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.550
It's a... service animal.

01:58.584 --> 02:00.719
I would seriously think that
zipping a Seeing Eye dog

02:00.753 --> 02:02.888
in your bag would hinder it
from doing its job.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.891
You know, there are so many dogs
out there that need good homes,

02:05.925 --> 02:07.993
and you're just treating it
like some fashion accessory?

02:08.026 --> 02:09.428
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

02:09.461 --> 02:11.296
Screw you... PETA.

02:11.331 --> 02:15.067
God, people are
just unbelievable.

02:17.870 --> 02:20.439
I think I just found my cause.

02:23.221 --> 02:26.099
Sync & corrections by wilson0804
www.Addic7ed.com

02:33.252 --> 02:35.220
Can I get you a menu?

02:35.254 --> 02:37.489
I was wondering if your boss

02:37.523 --> 02:40.792
would mind putting up a poster.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.327
Uh, tell him

02:42.362 --> 02:46.832
if he decides not to, that I'm
gonna accuse him of elder abuse.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.635
Uh, "The Lexington Home
for Retired Performers

02:49.669 --> 02:51.670
presents Peter Pan."

02:51.704 --> 02:53.939
Yeah, we thought
we'd take a shot at it.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.341
Well, in case
NBC casts Clay Aiken

02:56.376 --> 02:57.976
and it's ruined for good.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.280
You know, I won't even ask him;
I'll put it up in the window.

03:02.982 --> 03:06.685
Hey, Pillsbury,
why the long face?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.021
You look like

03:09.055 --> 03:11.823
the saddest dough boy
in the world.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.826
Oh, I wouldn't want to bother
you with any of my problems.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.096
I usually just file it all away,
and then wait for an episode

03:18.131 --> 03:20.365
of Long Island Medium
to let it all out.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.800
Are you sure?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.802
It's like everyone

03:23.836 --> 03:26.738
in my life has moved on
to something except for me.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.374
When did I become the mother
in a Nancy Meyers movie?

03:29.409 --> 03:32.377
I mean, all they need me for
is to remind them how talented

03:32.412 --> 03:34.546
and beautiful they are...
it's like they don't care.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.682
I care.
I can't tell you how nice it is

03:36.716 --> 03:38.283
to talk to someone
without them texting

03:38.318 --> 03:39.651
in the middle
of the conversation.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.954
Oh, I know exactly how you feel.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.189
Most of my friends can't hear.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.158
Mm. I'm Kurt, by the way.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.392
Maggie Banks.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.528
Wait a second.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.897
D-Did I just have
a therapy session

03:51.931 --> 03:54.099
with-with the Maggie Banks,

03:54.133 --> 03:55.500
the-the Broadway legend?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.502
You were in one of the biggest
Broadway flops in history.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.772
Well, in my defense,
Helen Keller the Musical

04:00.807 --> 04:03.075
was the talk of the town.

04:03.109 --> 04:04.276
"She can't hear

04:04.310 --> 04:07.446
or see, but she has
a voice of gold."

04:07.480 --> 04:09.548
Now, that was a tagline.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.550
Looks like my ride is here.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.085
How did you boys

04:13.119 --> 04:14.920
find me so fast?
Actually, you dropped

04:14.954 --> 04:17.623
a couple of posters, Maggie...
we're just following the trail.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.892
Yeah, 18 blocks...
it's a new record.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.427
Well, someone has to advertise.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.530
It was nice

04:24.564 --> 04:26.565
to talk to you, Pillsbury.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.599
You, too.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.369
And if you don't have
any plans...

04:30.403 --> 04:33.105
and it would seem
that you don't...

04:33.139 --> 04:35.340
come and visit us in rehearsal.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.143
I would love to, Maggie. Thanks.
Good.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.779
See ya.
Okay, guys.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.447
Can I drive today?

04:42.482 --> 04:44.683
So they really just
stay in these cages all day?

04:44.717 --> 04:46.718
Oh, no, we give
them five walks a day.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.154
We take them to a dog run
for two hours of exercise

04:49.189 --> 04:51.290
every other day...
we really do our best,

04:51.324 --> 04:53.325
given the limited
funding that we have.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.495
You got to remember, these are rescue
dogs, you know? Most of these dogs have

04:56.529 --> 05:00.399
been living on the streets, or
they were abandoned, abused...

05:00.433 --> 05:03.735
- Oh...
- So... you know,

05:03.770 --> 05:05.938
what happens
to them eventually?

05:05.972 --> 05:08.540
Well, it depends on how old they
are, really. We try to get as many

05:08.575 --> 05:13.178
of them adopted as we can, but
when we can't, not much choice.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.214
You know, it's...
it's the worst part of my job.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.516
Well, that's why
we're here, actually.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.818
We want to arrange
a very public

05:19.853 --> 05:21.887
a-and great event
for a cause that

05:21.921 --> 05:24.156
we are so passionate
animals.

05:24.190 --> 05:27.025
Yeah, you said something about Broadway?
Yes. I am starring currently

05:27.060 --> 05:28.794
in the acclaimed
Broadway revival of Funny Girl.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.164
I don't know if you've seen it. I
don't really get into the city much.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.600
I'm not a Broadway guy. But I liked Cats.
  Okay,

05:34.634 --> 05:36.635
well, it doesn't really matter,
you know... we just want

05:36.669 --> 05:38.437
to spearhead a benefit,

05:38.471 --> 05:40.706
guided towards the Broadway
community... aka me...

05:40.740 --> 05:41.940
I got it, I got it.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.142
Okay, well, you know,

05:43.176 --> 05:44.910
we'll take care
of everything, um...

05:44.944 --> 05:46.178
- Okay. That's great.
- Really?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.446
Yeah, I'm in for sure.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.747
- Yeah?
- I'm in. Yeah.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.549
I'll get the information
together; let's do it.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.385
Okay. Amazing. Thank you.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.387
We love you.
Hi.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.389
We should get one.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.992
Look at you. Ooh.
Oh, no. Sam, I love animals,

06:00.026 --> 06:02.327
but I've got my hands
full taking care of you.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.430
You're more than enough.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.705
It happens sometimes.
Uh, it's no big deal.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.840
When they get like this,

06:14.874 --> 06:17.309
I pipe music in
through the P.A. system,

06:17.343 --> 06:19.678
but it's all busted now, so...

06:19.712 --> 06:22.714
Today's your lucky day... I just
read John Mayer's bio, and he

06:22.749 --> 06:26.685
said you always have to have
your guitar 80% of the time.

I've got it.
I have got the perfect plan

08:48.061 --> 08:49.928
for how to get this thing
off the ground.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.397
Later today,
you are going to take

08:51.431 --> 08:53.532
a couple of dogs
for a walk around the block,

08:53.566 --> 08:55.901
where paparazzi will be
conveniently waiting.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.669
You're gonna get snapped,
give a quote,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.505
bam, Broadway Bitches
is off and running.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.006
And I also snagged you

09:01.041 --> 09:03.108
this designer number
by a designer that is so fancy,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.711
I can't even pronounce his name.
There's hardly any vowels in it.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.546
And if you wear it and
get photographed in it,

09:07.547 --> 09:10.427
you get to keep it for free. But how
do we know that they'll be there?

09:10.450 --> 09:11.583
I made a couple of calls

09:11.618 --> 09:12.985
and I tweeted from your account,

09:13.019 --> 09:14.887
and I used hashtag living,

09:14.921 --> 09:17.356
so everyone sees it.
Oh, perfect.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.091
Oh, my God, Kurt!
I have the best news

09:19.125 --> 09:20.492
that I've been wanting
to tell you about.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.661
Is Liza off her meds, running
around Central Park again?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.130
I'm starting
a dog-rescue charity!

09:25.165 --> 09:27.499
And Santana and Mercedes and I
are doing a performance.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.534
It's gonna be great.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.203
Oh, could I perform, too?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.639
I-I've been itching to do
something outside of school.

09:33.673 --> 09:34.973
One Three Hill's
been on a hiatus

09:35.008 --> 09:36.508
ever since Elliot went
to his yoga retreat

09:36.543 --> 09:38.583
and Dani's Roller Derby team
became state champions.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.846
I-I... I think we're
just gonna keep it us girls.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.681
We don't want the event
to be, like...

09:42.716 --> 09:44.049
Amateur open mic night?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.951
No, no, no, Kurt.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.619
This is not personal, okay?

09:47.654 --> 09:49.488
This is about Rachel
and her image.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.923
And you are so good

09:50.957 --> 09:53.192
that you would just be
pulling focus from her.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.327
No, I-I get it.
I get that I haven't exactly

09:55.362 --> 09:58.063
made a name for myself like
the rest of you have, but...

09:58.098 --> 09:59.465
gosh, you'd just think
after everything,

09:59.499 --> 10:01.200
someone would
throw me a bone for once.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.102
Kurt, wait.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.577
All right, boys, I don't want...

10:15.648 --> 10:18.417
I'll leave the window unlocked.

10:18.451 --> 10:23.655
That strange boy may come
looking for his shadow.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.325
Oh, Pillsbury, you made it!

10:26.359 --> 10:28.060
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.995
Sit down.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.565
Take in the magic!

10:37.437 --> 10:40.205
Debbie, it's your...
it's your cue.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.709
Debbie! Rule number one:
hearing aids on

10:43.743 --> 10:46.278
during rehearsal!

10:53.353 --> 10:55.354
Uh-oh.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.524
Peter's dead, folks.

11:04.550 --> 11:07.405
Of all times
she chooses to die,

11:07.439 --> 11:10.875
less than a week away
from opening night.

11:10.910 --> 11:13.111
Oh, she was always so selfish.

11:13.145 --> 11:14.779
We have to cancel.

11:14.814 --> 11:18.116
Debbie was the only one
with hips strong enough

11:18.150 --> 11:19.951
f-for the harness.

11:19.985 --> 11:23.655
Take a walk down
the halls here.

11:23.689 --> 11:25.757
Room after room of beds

11:25.791 --> 11:28.693
filled with people who won't
get out of them anymore.

11:28.727 --> 11:30.628
Not because they can't

11:30.663 --> 11:33.364
but because they can't find
any reason to.

11:33.399 --> 11:34.966
This show,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.768
uh, getting up in front

11:36.802 --> 11:39.103
of an audience...
this was my reason.

11:41.507 --> 11:44.075
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.744
Wh-Wh... uh, when is
opening night?

11:46.779 --> 11:48.513
Uh, Monday
at 4:00 p.m.

11:48.547 --> 11:50.547
Incidentally,
that's also closing night.

11:50.549 --> 11:52.851
I-I could fill in,
unless there's a rule

11:52.885 --> 11:54.619
about residents only
being in the show.

11:54.653 --> 11:57.489
First of all,
we only have two rules.

11:57.523 --> 11:59.424
One, remember your teeth.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.526
And your teeth.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.528
And... don't mix up

12:03.562 --> 12:05.029
your night pills

12:05.064 --> 12:06.998
with your day pills.
It's simple.

12:07.032 --> 12:09.000
I thought I was a pterodactyl.

12:09.034 --> 12:12.137
Are you sure, Pillsbury?

12:12.171 --> 12:14.639
Peter Pan is a very vocally

12:14.673 --> 12:16.674
demanding role for a woman.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.943
Can you handle it?
Oh, yeah.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.211
I-I'm a countertenor,

12:20.246 --> 12:21.679
and I practically have the score
memorized.

12:21.714 --> 12:23.782
I was obsessed with my tape

12:23.816 --> 12:25.283
of Mary Martin's version
when I was a kid.

12:25.317 --> 12:26.551
She was my childhood hero.

12:26.585 --> 12:28.653
Which explains a lot
now that I think about it.

12:28.687 --> 12:30.188
We have a piano.

12:30.222 --> 12:33.658
Uh, could you audition
with any music or anything?

12:33.692 --> 12:36.394
You know, we just
can't hand you a part.

12:36.428 --> 12:38.897
We have standards. Right?

12:38.931 --> 12:41.099
I-I do. I always carry

12:41.133 --> 12:42.834
sheet music with me
just in case.

12:42.868 --> 12:44.936
Oh. Oh.
Oh.

Aw... This is
an unusually violent game.

15:38.844 --> 15:40.211
Hey, McConaughey. Hey.

15:40.246 --> 15:41.713
All right, all right, all right.

15:41.747 --> 15:43.081
Grr.

15:43.115 --> 15:44.849
We're working
on his impressions.

15:44.884 --> 15:45.850
It's like watching

15:45.885 --> 15:47.385
Goofy teach tricks to Pluto.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.540
Mercedes is gonna
freak when she gets home.

15:49.555 --> 15:51.022
Hush. She's gonna fall
in love with him,

15:51.057 --> 15:53.491
just like I did. You have to
help me sell it to her so she,

15:53.526 --> 15:55.627
like, thinks he's really awesome
when she gets here, okay?

15:55.661 --> 15:58.096
Don't worry. I got your back.

15:58.130 --> 16:00.098
Sam? Did you
go back

16:00.132 --> 16:01.199
and adopt that dog?

16:01.233 --> 16:03.201
Uh... uh, hey.
I tried to stop him.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.502
Uh, baby, yeah.

16:04.537 --> 16:06.171
Sorry I didn't, uh, talk
to you about it first.

16:06.205 --> 16:07.439
It's just that when I saw

16:07.473 --> 16:09.107
McConaughey in his cage,
something inside me just clicked

16:09.141 --> 16:10.575
and I knew that we were meant
for each other.

16:10.609 --> 16:11.876
I blame Sarah McLachlan.

16:11.911 --> 16:14.079
I don't mean to be patronizing,

16:14.113 --> 16:17.282
but we have a kitchen full
of dead Chia Pets

16:17.316 --> 16:18.383
that you can't take care of.

16:18.417 --> 16:21.186
This is a living,
breathing creature.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.620
So is Artie,
and I take care of him.

16:22.621 --> 16:23.702
Hold up. Did you just...

16:23.723 --> 16:25.023
Look, hey, look, I know

16:25.057 --> 16:26.758
I can take care of him, okay?
I just...

16:26.792 --> 16:28.153
Give me a chance.
Look, look, look.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.462
Oh, McConaughey loves you.

16:30.496 --> 16:32.997
- He lo...
- Oh, oh, look at the face.

16:33.032 --> 16:35.900
- The pooch. He d... The face.
- Okay. Fine.

16:35.935 --> 16:40.372
If it's that important to you,
we will try it.

16:40.406 --> 16:41.973
Okay. She's gone. Let's go.

16:42.007 --> 16:44.242
- Did you pay the gas bill?
- Yeah.

16:44.276 --> 16:46.778
Uh, no.
Uh, I've...

16:46.812 --> 16:49.381
Artie was just
into this video game.

16:49.415 --> 16:51.983
Did you take out the recycling?

16:52.018 --> 16:54.586
Um, Artie was gonna do it
on his way out.

16:54.620 --> 16:55.954
Am I still here? Am I invisible?

16:57.523 --> 16:59.290
Hold up.

16:59.325 --> 17:01.092
Is that my faux-huahua?

17:01.127 --> 17:02.160
Uh...

17:06.132 --> 17:07.832
Oh, I did that.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.787
Okay, you better
clean this mess up.

17:09.801 --> 17:11.469
Okay, just because
McConaughey is cute,

17:11.503 --> 17:13.505
it doesn't mean...

17:20.179 --> 17:21.579
Oh, no.

17:21.614 --> 17:22.854
Oh, I know

17:22.882 --> 17:24.281
that that dog
is not eating my hair.

17:24.282 --> 17:26.017
I know

17:26.051 --> 17:28.586
that you did not let that dog
near my bedroom or my wardrobe

17:28.621 --> 17:30.622
or my makeup!

17:36.062 --> 17:37.662
I got to go. Um...
Sam!

17:37.697 --> 17:39.297
Can one of you guys
bring me Don't.

17:39.331 --> 17:40.632
Down the stairs? Don't you even speak.
Don't you even look

17:40.666 --> 17:42.033
I got you. like you're
about to speak to me.

17:42.068 --> 17:43.802
You just pack up that dog
and you take him back

17:43.836 --> 17:45.937
where you got him
or, so help me,

17:45.972 --> 17:47.872
I will go full-on Carcosa
on you.

17:56.916 --> 17:58.683
Easy.

17:58.718 --> 18:01.686
Okay.

18:06.289 --> 18:08.769
Oh, my God, is
that Rachel Berry,

18:08.794 --> 18:10.729
star of Broadway's
smash-hit musical

18:10.763 --> 18:12.831
I love her!

18:12.865 --> 18:15.400
I saw Funny Girl

18:15.434 --> 18:18.370
five times!
She is just so likeable!

18:18.404 --> 18:19.738
Oh!

18:19.772 --> 18:21.539
Ms. Berry,
what on earth are you doing

18:21.574 --> 18:22.941
walking all these
beautiful dogs?

18:22.975 --> 18:24.409
Well, someone has to.

18:24.443 --> 18:26.211
Did you know
that New York City shelters

18:26.245 --> 18:28.613
are the most overpopulated
in the state?

18:28.648 --> 18:31.883
What? No, I didn't know that.
That's such a shame.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.353
That's why I'm starting
my own dog rescue charity,

18:35.388 --> 18:37.856
Broadway Bitches.

18:38.924 --> 18:40.892
Okay. Wait,
just stay right there.

18:40.926 --> 18:43.194
At the, uh, Spotlight Diner.

18:49.969 --> 18:51.002
Okay.

18:51.037 --> 18:52.437
Oh, my God. Stay.

18:52.471 --> 18:54.339
Oh, my God.

18:55.608 --> 18:57.442
Oh, my God. Ah!

19:03.082 --> 19:04.322
Oh, my God.

19:15.971 --> 19:19.018
At least you're wearing underwear.
I got dragged four blocks

19:19.053 --> 19:20.620
and now I have to
pay for this dress

19:20.654 --> 19:22.155
and that man got
bit by a shih tzu.

19:22.189 --> 19:23.289
Seriously, is this a good idea?

19:23.323 --> 19:24.763
Because I feel like
I look worse now.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.826
No. Yes, this is
a good idea, okay?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.961
Um, everybody's talking
about your activism.

19:28.996 --> 19:31.631
And, in fact, out of the 500
Broadway Bitches Evites

19:31.665 --> 19:34.567
that I sent out this morning,
over half are confirmed.

19:34.601 --> 19:37.236
And I even have a reporter
from NYTheatreNews.com ready

19:37.271 --> 19:38.671
to do a piece on it.

19:38.706 --> 19:40.573
So just stick to the plan

19:40.607 --> 19:42.575
and don't go soft on me.

19:42.609 --> 19:45.511
Guys, I got good news.
I landed a role.

19:45.546 --> 19:47.480
"The Lexington Home

19:47.514 --> 19:49.615
for Retired Performers
presents Peter Pan"?

19:49.650 --> 19:50.583
And I'm Peter!

19:50.617 --> 19:51.617
They needed an
emergency replacement

19:51.652 --> 19:52.952
because the woman

19:52.986 --> 19:55.960
playing him dropped... out.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.227
Possibly be serious.

19:57.262 --> 20:00.898
I am, actually,
and I'm very excited about it.

20:00.932 --> 20:03.667
Opening night is Monday,
and I'd love to have you.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.336
No, sorry, can't make it.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.605
As much as I would love
to watch Homocchio

20:07.639 --> 20:09.873
and the Geriatric Puppets
put on a depressing

20:09.908 --> 20:13.310
sub-community theatre show,
Rachel's event is that night.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.845
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem

20:14.879 --> 20:16.313
because the show starts at 4:00.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.383
I'm sorry, Kurt. Santana has
me doing all these photo ops

20:19.417 --> 20:21.919
and interviews, and my
reputation is at stake here.

20:21.953 --> 20:23.887
Seriously, you know,
I could lose jobs

20:23.922 --> 20:25.356
if I don't clean this up.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.959
I bend over backwards for you
every time you need something.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.263
Well, I need you now
so please support me in this.

20:32.297 --> 20:35.633
I am doing something good
for the animals.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.034
No, you're doing it
for yourself.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.436
You treat me exactly like
the world treats those dogs...

20:39.471 --> 20:41.105
you just cast me aside.

20:41.139 --> 20:42.339
Well, I'm done being a friend

20:42.340 --> 20:44.220
only when it's convenient
for you.

20:46.069 --> 20:48.989
Mercedes doesn't want me
to get rid of the dog, okay?

20:49.014 --> 20:50.781
She just wants him
to stop tearing everything up.

20:50.815 --> 20:53.183
You seriously think
you can train that dog?

20:53.218 --> 20:55.119
I had to teach you
how to use Velcro.

20:55.153 --> 20:57.655
Okay, yeah, well, Velcro's hard.
It's like black magic.

20:57.689 --> 21:01.358
But, look, I can do this, okay?
Doggies crave discipline.

21:01.393 --> 21:04.562
We'll just run him through
the Doggy Gauntlet of Doom...

21:04.596 --> 21:06.564
it's a working title,
don't judge me...

21:06.598 --> 21:09.233
and then once Mercedes gets home
tonight, he'll be groomed,

21:09.267 --> 21:11.235
trained and ready
to melt her heart

21:11.269 --> 21:14.605
with those big, beautiful puppy
dog eyes that he gets from me.

21:14.639 --> 21:17.007

Boys, I've returned

23:23.835 --> 23:26.871
Maggie, you're supposed
to be on the ground.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.007
Peter, we killed a giant bird
while you were gone.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.979
If I get down,
I'm not getting back up.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.714
Oh, we look ridiculous!

23:36.748 --> 23:38.382
What were we thinking when

23:38.416 --> 23:39.750
we chose to do Peter Pan?

23:39.784 --> 23:41.418
Well, we wanted
to show our families

23:41.453 --> 23:43.154
that we were still
energetic and young.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.355
Right, Freddie?

23:46.358 --> 23:48.859
But you guys are still
energetic and young.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.729
You know, if you want to seem
young, you got to feel young.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.130
I don't know about all of that.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.299
I was thinking
of changing up the music.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.667
You know, maybe updating it
a little bit.

23:56.701 --> 23:58.269
I still think that we should do

23:58.303 --> 24:00.938
The Importance
of Being Earnest.

24:00.972 --> 24:03.541
Ever since you were a question
on Jeopardy!,

24:03.575 --> 24:05.676
you have been
such a know-it-all.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.879
Maggie, flowers came for you.

24:08.914 --> 24:10.181
Oh.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.953
Oh, they're from
my daughter, Clara!

24:15.987 --> 24:19.089
She's a defense
attorney. "Mom,

24:19.124 --> 24:22.493
"sorry I have
to miss opening night.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.929
I have to be in Reno
for a deposition."

24:27.866 --> 24:29.834
Oh.

24:29.868 --> 24:33.270
She is so thoughtful.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.539
She spoils me.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.477
Oh, that's too bad.

24:39.511 --> 24:41.912
I know how important
Clara is to her.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.614
She talks about her constantly.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.008
All about their lunches, and
their late night phone calls,

24:46.017 --> 24:47.218
and their double dates.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.220
Except none of it's real.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.122
Those flowers aren't
from her daughter.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.957
Maggie sends herself flowers

24:52.991 --> 24:54.959
once a week
to keep up appearances.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.461
Clara hasn't been here in years.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.239
You are shredding my last nerve.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.741
Before you say anything else,
you should know

25:10.776 --> 25:13.344
that Artie and I tamed the beast
that is McConaughey.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.545
He's not barking,

25:14.579 --> 25:16.881
he's been off his leash
for the last few hours,

25:16.915 --> 25:18.783
but didn't poop anywhere
he wasn't supposed to,

25:18.817 --> 25:20.985
and he didn't eat any
of your weird, strange,

25:21.019 --> 25:22.987
Indian hair.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.123
All of that is great,

25:26.158 --> 25:27.992
Sam, but we talked about this,

25:28.026 --> 25:30.728
and we both agreed,
we can't take care of a dog.

25:30.762 --> 25:31.996
Really? Because
it looks like

25:32.030 --> 25:33.764
I'm doing a pretty good
job of it right now.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.332
For the moment.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.669
But what's gonna happen when
you have, like, a 20-hour shoot,

25:38.703 --> 25:41.772
and you can't walk McConaughey,
or-or put out his food?

25:41.807 --> 25:44.341
I don't know. I thought
maybe you could help.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.112
Well, I would, and I could, but
what happens when I go on tour?

25:48.146 --> 25:51.282
Uh, we could get a dog-sitter.
I don't know.

25:51.316 --> 25:52.483
Who's gonna call the sitter?

25:52.517 --> 25:55.052
Who's gonna make sure
that they have a key to get in?

25:55.087 --> 25:56.520
Who's gonna pay them?

25:56.555 --> 25:58.389
I am, and you know what else
I've been thinking about?

25:58.423 --> 26:00.424
You going on tour, and me
being in this brownstone,

26:00.459 --> 26:03.160
all alone
and wanting some company.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.430
You know, last time I checked,

26:06.465 --> 26:08.265
New York's a pretty lonely town.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.934
Is that what
this is really about?

26:09.968 --> 26:11.936
Maybe.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.804
Partly, yes.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.039
But if we're being honest,

26:15.073 --> 26:16.373
I think it's also about

26:16.408 --> 26:18.275
when I suggested
we take McConaughey home,

26:18.310 --> 26:21.078
you couldn't even imagine me
being able to take care of him,

26:21.113 --> 26:22.993
okay, and that's just...
that's just crap, okay.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.249
It's like you're looking at me
like I'm a boy and not a man.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.418
- Sam...
- Look, I took care of

26:27.452 --> 26:29.019
my whole family
when they had nothing, okay.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.988
When they were as poor
and as homeless as McConaughey.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.189
I made sure they ate,

26:32.224 --> 26:33.691
I made sure
they had a roof over their head,

26:33.725 --> 26:34.885
I made sure my little brother

26:34.893 --> 26:36.093
and sister got
to school on time.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.294
Me, Sam, the slacker.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.796
- Oh, Sam, I... I know.
- But, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.165
I know... I know
that I forget about

26:41.199 --> 26:42.533
appointments sometimes,

26:42.567 --> 26:44.402
and I leave my clothes
around the apartment,

26:44.436 --> 26:45.903
and I get distracted
playing video games,

26:45.937 --> 26:47.371
but that doesn't mean
I'm a joke.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.707
I never called you a joke.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.376
Mercedes, look, I...
I want to marry you eventually,

26:52.411 --> 26:54.612
when we're ready, and I
want to have a family

26:54.646 --> 26:55.846
with a house and a yard
and kids and stuff,

26:55.881 --> 26:57.381
but that's only gonna happen

26:57.416 --> 26:59.417
if you start taking me
seriously, and that starts with

26:59.451 --> 27:02.753
me proving to you that I can
take care of McConaughey.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.924
You-you did, and, uh, I'm giving
you your props for that.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.826
Okay, great.
But I...

27:08.860 --> 27:11.395
I still don't think
that you should keep him.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.530
Why not?

27:13.899 --> 27:15.366
Because it's not good for him,

27:15.400 --> 27:17.234
Sam. Like I said, I'm about

27:17.269 --> 27:19.036
to go on tour, and you...

27:19.071 --> 27:21.806
your schedule's crazy,
and it's just gonna get worse.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.742
So, what's the point
of having a dog, even one

27:24.776 --> 27:26.377
as cute as McConaughey,
if you can't

27:26.411 --> 27:29.580
take care of him,
and you can't enjoy him?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.951
You heard
what they do to the pets

27:33.985 --> 27:36.387
that you bring back
to the shelters, right?

27:36.421 --> 27:40.691
Well, then, you're gonna have
to find a home for him.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.259
And I promise you, some day,

27:42.294 --> 27:44.328
we're gonna have
everything that you want.

27:44.362 --> 27:45.963
Okay, and that includes a dog.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.566
But we're still figuring
things out between you and me,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.968
like who we are together
and where we're gonna be.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.471
I just don't think

27:53.505 --> 27:56.140
that we should drag McConaughey
into that, do you?

28:12.734 --> 28:14.701
Liz, send in my 10:00.

28:18.673 --> 28:21.809
Hi. Um, I'm Kurt Hummel.

28:21.843 --> 28:24.278
Um, I-I didn't
actually cause

28:24.312 --> 28:26.380
a major chemical spill
in National Park.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.582
Uh, your receptionist said
that you were really busy,

28:28.616 --> 28:32.352
and that was the only way that I
could make an appointment, so...

28:32.387 --> 28:34.054
Oh. Uh...

28:34.088 --> 28:35.222
Liz, call security.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.057
Well...
They should only need one guy.

28:37.091 --> 28:38.659
No. It's-it's about your mother.

28:38.693 --> 28:40.093
I'm-I'm friends with her.

28:40.128 --> 28:44.698
Wait. Is this some kind of
Martha Raye-Mark Harris thing?

28:44.732 --> 28:46.733
'Cause she doesn't
have any money.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.937
No, no. We're performing
together at the home.

28:49.971 --> 28:51.038
Uh, Peter Pan.

28:51.072 --> 28:52.906
Uh, she's Wendy, I'm Peter.

28:52.941 --> 28:56.076
Okay. Weird, but whatever.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.912
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but the minute the show's over,

28:58.947 --> 29:00.914
she's gonna lose your number.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.549
I...

29:02.584 --> 29:05.085
I don't know what happened
between you two, but, uh,

29:05.120 --> 29:08.288
I can't imagine a sweet old lady
like that hurting anyone.

29:08.323 --> 29:10.657
Well...

29:10.692 --> 29:12.760
she wasn't always
a sweet old lady.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.796
She was young and ambitious and

29:15.830 --> 29:17.030
so hungry to get back
in the game,

29:17.065 --> 29:18.426
she tended
to forget little things,

29:18.433 --> 29:22.436
like her daughter at school
and birthdays.

29:22.470 --> 29:26.940
And I bet
that was very painful,

29:26.975 --> 29:30.310
but your mother is 86 years old.

29:30.345 --> 29:33.380
I mean, don't you want
to forgive before it's too late?

29:33.414 --> 29:35.382
Oh, I've forgiven.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.718
Wasn't her fault.

29:37.752 --> 29:40.354
She never should have become
a mother in the first place.

29:40.388 --> 29:43.090
Did you know that she sends
herself flowers from you,

29:43.124 --> 29:44.825
and that she talks about you
constantly?

29:44.859 --> 29:47.728
I know all about the scar
on your elbow from the time

29:47.762 --> 29:50.330
that you climbed on the counter
trying to get the box

29:50.365 --> 29:52.900
of Frosted Flakes, nd your
fear of balloons, and that

29:52.934 --> 29:54.101
you aced the SAT.

29:54.135 --> 29:56.103
Wow.

29:56.137 --> 29:57.704
Did she also tell you

29:57.739 --> 29:59.973
that she missed
my high school graduation?

30:00.008 --> 30:03.811
She had a dream,
and she got lost in it.

30:05.713 --> 30:08.849
But she is clearly
full of regret.

30:18.326 --> 30:21.061
My mom died when I was eight,

30:21.096 --> 30:24.698
and I spent my entire life
pretending that I had one.

30:24.732 --> 30:27.868
Whatever she did to you,
yours is still here.

30:29.404 --> 30:33.818
Don't you see that by coming
to see her perform

30:33.853 --> 30:36.187
for taking her away from you
that you could heal all of this?

30:37.857 --> 30:40.125
Well, your mother
couldn't take care of you

30:40.159 --> 30:43.695
when you were little, but
you could take care of her now.

30:55.265 --> 30:57.585
Oh, this is better than
I could have ever imagined!

30:57.610 --> 30:59.778
I mean, a dozen dogs
have already been adopted,

30:59.812 --> 31:01.680
and we just started! Hi.

31:01.714 --> 31:03.715
Okay, um, Beverly Stevens
from NYTheatreNews.com

31:03.749 --> 31:05.450
is going to be
here later today,

31:05.484 --> 31:07.252
and I've picked out
the perfect pooch

31:07.286 --> 31:09.354
for you to pose with.

31:09.388 --> 31:11.089
He's a three-legged dog!

31:11.123 --> 31:12.524
Oh. Come here.

31:12.558 --> 31:14.859
Who doesn't love a lady
holding a three-legged dog?

31:14.894 --> 31:16.928
You know, it's like
a ticket to Heaven.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.463
Oh, Santana,
you're really good at this.

31:18.497 --> 31:20.131
Have you ever thought about
doing this professionally?

31:20.166 --> 31:23.234
Sure enough,
every time I watch Scandal.

31:24.637 --> 31:26.604
Okay, come on, Sam.

31:26.639 --> 31:30.008
We have to turn McConaughey
into the doggie rescue.

31:30.042 --> 31:32.010
No way, Jose.

31:32.044 --> 31:33.978
Guys, I think we have an issue.

31:34.013 --> 31:35.146
I'm going to
have to take the dog.

31:35.181 --> 31:36.314
You're telling me
I can't take this dog?

31:36.349 --> 31:37.509
Just, I need to take the dog.

31:37.516 --> 31:38.783
No, I can't believe that!
No, no, no, no, no.

31:38.818 --> 31:40.318
No. Yeah,
'cause I have to take

31:40.353 --> 31:42.120
a photo with that dog
later, so...

31:42.154 --> 31:43.621
But this is the dog
my son wants to adopt.

31:43.656 --> 31:45.323
Isn't that the whole point
of this event?

31:45.358 --> 31:46.958
Um, well, maybe you could just
wait a couple of hours?

31:46.993 --> 31:50.328
I have to catch a train back
to Long Island in 20 minutes.

31:50.363 --> 31:51.730
Okay, I'm so sorry, lady,

31:51.764 --> 31:53.531
but hand over the tripod,
and nobody'll get hurt.

31:53.566 --> 31:55.467
I'm sorry...
I can't...

31:55.501 --> 31:57.469
I get it.

31:57.503 --> 32:00.171
I know who you are.
I read the Broadway blogs.

32:00.206 --> 32:02.674
You can't redeem a lie
with more lies.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.643
You may get away
with this farce this time,

32:05.678 --> 32:07.979
but you're a fraud, and
it's gonna come out soon enough.

32:08.014 --> 32:10.782
You don't care
about these dogs.

32:10.816 --> 32:14.819
I doubt you care much
about anyone but yourself.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.855
Come on, honey, let's go home.

32:19.792 --> 32:20.859
Don't listen to her.

32:20.893 --> 32:22.427
Look at...

32:22.461 --> 32:24.062
Look at her shoes.

32:44.024 --> 32:46.144
Thanks. I just don't want
the harness to show.

32:46.169 --> 32:47.536
I mean,
the show's tacky enough.

32:47.571 --> 32:49.271
Well, I am missing
dinner with June

32:49.306 --> 32:51.440
and Diane von Furstenberg
at Annie Leibovitz's house,

32:51.475 --> 32:54.043
but... there's no
other place I'd rather be.

32:54.077 --> 32:55.945
Drop all the names you want,

32:55.979 --> 32:59.582
my old ladies are much
cooler than yours.

32:59.616 --> 33:02.218
It's really nice
to see you so happy.

33:02.252 --> 33:03.819
I never thought
that a retirement home

33:03.854 --> 33:05.855
can make someone smile so much.

33:05.889 --> 33:08.691
You know, for the first time
since I moved here, I...

33:08.725 --> 33:10.960
I feel like I'm doing
something with purpose.

33:10.994 --> 33:13.496
Besides school, of course.

33:13.530 --> 33:15.564
Should I save some seats?

33:15.599 --> 33:18.534
No, no, I'll see you after.
Okay.

33:18.568 --> 33:20.269
Love you.
Me, too.

33:20.303 --> 33:22.471
Oh, uh, don't sit
in the first row.

33:22.506 --> 33:24.940
I don't trust the harness.
And Gladys has been having

33:24.975 --> 33:27.243
a hard time keeping
solid foods down, so...

33:27.277 --> 33:29.178
Okay.

33:29.212 --> 33:30.646
Break a leg.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.515
Thanks.

33:38.853 --> 33:41.333
You know, Maggie,
I was thinking,

33:41.358 --> 33:43.926
since your daughter and my
friends are always so busy,

33:43.960 --> 33:45.828
why don't we become
each other's family?

33:45.862 --> 33:47.963
I mean, you'd be
doing me a favor.

33:47.998 --> 33:50.478
I-I could use
someone to talk to.

33:52.169 --> 33:55.771
Well, as long as
I'd be doing you a favor,

33:55.806 --> 33:57.173
I'd love to.

34:22.165 --> 34:23.933
Hello? Hey, it's me.

34:23.967 --> 34:27.203
Um, my show is about to start,
and I just wanted

34:27.237 --> 34:29.205
to wish you good luck
at the benefit.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.907
I know things have been really
tense between us this week,

34:31.942 --> 34:34.110
um, but I would
never want you to think

34:34.143 --> 34:36.978
that I'm not proud
or supportive of you.

34:37.013 --> 34:39.949
Um, I'm-I'm very glad
you're doing what you're doing,

34:39.983 --> 34:42.184
because... my life
would certainly be dull

34:42.219 --> 34:44.420
without friends like you
to inspire me every day.

34:44.454 --> 34:47.123
That is very sweet of you,
but I have to go,

34:47.157 --> 34:51.092
because, um, my best friend's
show is about to start.

34:55.132 --> 34:57.199

Seeing you in the audience
makes this

37:27.918 --> 37:29.952
the best performance of my life.

37:29.987 --> 37:33.856
A friend of yours told me
it was one I couldn't miss.

37:33.890 --> 37:35.758
I'm so glad he did.

37:35.792 --> 37:38.461
I have so many things to say.

37:38.495 --> 37:40.863
So many "I'm sorrys."

37:40.897 --> 37:44.567
And I so want to know
about your life.

37:45.702 --> 37:47.837
Oh, my gosh you were amazing!

37:47.871 --> 37:49.538
I couldn't stop smiling
watching you perform

37:49.573 --> 37:51.107
with all these sweet old folks.

37:51.141 --> 37:53.209
It's like, this is gonna be us
in the future when we're older,

37:53.243 --> 37:54.477
and be so cute.
It is,

37:54.511 --> 37:56.045
and we'll be very cute.
Oh, dude, hold up.

37:56.079 --> 37:58.848
Well, hello. This harness cannot
be good for the sack puppies.

37:58.882 --> 38:00.249
Oh, years of skinny jeans

38:00.283 --> 38:02.018
have prepared me
for this performance.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.320
Well, you look great.
The costume and the key.

38:04.354 --> 38:05.788
Yeah, I just wish
more people could see

38:05.822 --> 38:06.822
Maggie and the gang perform.

38:06.857 --> 38:08.424
I mean, they're the real stars.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.092
Hey, there's a bus outside.

38:10.127 --> 38:12.228
There's a... Freddie, wake up!

38:12.262 --> 38:13.663
Wake up!

38:13.697 --> 38:15.798
Freddie, there's a bus outside,
and it's got a lift.

38:15.832 --> 38:17.333
Oh, a lift?
A lift.

38:17.367 --> 38:19.368
Yeah, okay.
Oh, boy.

38:19.403 --> 38:21.203
Why is there a bus outside?

38:21.238 --> 38:23.172
Artie was able to get
the film school

38:23.206 --> 38:24.940
to loan it to us for the day.

38:24.975 --> 38:27.209
This is your opening night gift.

38:27.244 --> 38:30.346
Hey, everybody!

38:30.380 --> 38:32.949
I'm Sam,

38:32.983 --> 38:35.217
and there's a bus outside.

38:35.252 --> 38:38.087
Old people usually freak me out,
but in this case,

38:38.121 --> 38:39.588
you guys are pretty cool.

38:39.623 --> 38:41.524
Anyway, Rachel has asked us

38:41.558 --> 38:43.159
on behalf
of the adoption charity

38:43.193 --> 38:45.528
Broadway Bitches,
to personally invite all of you

38:45.562 --> 38:47.229
to be our guest performers

38:47.264 --> 38:49.198
at an event we're holding
this evening.

38:52.703 --> 38:54.770
Well, what do you say, Maggie?

38:54.805 --> 38:57.006
Do you think you have
a second act in you?

38:57.040 --> 39:00.076
I never used to believe
in second acts,

39:00.110 --> 39:03.145
but you've proven me wrong.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.448
Great.

39:05.482 --> 39:08.517
To the bus, everybody!

39:11.234 --> 39:13.782
Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming

39:13.807 --> 39:15.908
and supporting Broadway Bitches.

39:15.942 --> 39:17.910
You know, as New Yorkers,

39:17.944 --> 39:20.412
we get so wrapped
up in our careers

39:20.447 --> 39:22.448
and making it that we forget
the importance

39:22.482 --> 39:24.984
of really creating a legacy
that we can be proud of.

39:25.018 --> 39:28.220
Um, and what better way
and what's more rewarding

39:28.255 --> 39:31.123
than giving back
to man's best friend

39:31.158 --> 39:33.092
and to all of our friends,
really.

39:33.126 --> 39:36.328
So please join me
in giving a warm welcome

39:36.363 --> 39:39.665
to some very special friends who
are here today to help us out.

39:39.699 --> 39:42.668
From the Lexington Home
of Retired Performers,

39:42.702 --> 39:44.403
give it up and enjoy the song.

39:44.437 --> 39:46.071
If he's not going home with us,

39:46.106 --> 39:48.026
we need to find the perfect
home for McConaughey.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.375
If you don't, Sam, I mean,

39:49.409 --> 39:50.609
we'll just,
we'll figure something out,

39:50.644 --> 39:52.178
but we're not gonna take him
back to the shelter.

42:29.669 --> 42:31.604
plus this amazing cause.

42:31.638 --> 42:33.038
Where did you get
the inspiration

42:33.073 --> 42:34.140
to put on an event like this?

42:34.174 --> 42:35.641
Well, it's funny that you ask,

42:35.675 --> 42:38.177
because, um, I actually have
an amazing publicist.

42:38.211 --> 42:39.512
Well, thank you.

42:39.546 --> 42:42.415
Hi, uh, Santana Lopez,
public relations.

42:42.449 --> 42:44.950
My motto is "If I can make
Berry work, I can do anything."

42:46.586 --> 42:50.054
And it was actually
my really amazing friend, Kurt,

42:50.088 --> 42:52.823
all these incredible retired
Broadway performers.

42:52.857 --> 42:55.125
Oh, well, we are uploading
the video

42:55.160 --> 42:57.795
that my cameraman shot
on our site immediately,

42:57.829 --> 43:00.763
and I am betting that we are
going to get a lot of hits.

43:00.788 --> 43:02.388
Thank you for all your support,

43:02.423 --> 43:03.756
but Rachel isn't giving herself
enough credit.

43:03.791 --> 43:05.091
I mean, this is
a true collaboration,

43:05.125 --> 43:08.089
- and we're just happy to
be giving back. - Yay!
