00:35.833 --> 00:37.300
* There's a man

00:37.300 --> 00:38.867
* Do you see

00:38.867 --> 00:42.400
* And he looks just
like you and me

00:42.400 --> 00:44.833
* Didn't you know

00:44.833 --> 00:49.433
* Everything he got don't show

00:49.433 --> 00:51.100
* There's a cop

00:51.100 --> 00:52.833
* Do you see

00:52.833 --> 00:56.133
* And he looks like
every cop on the street

00:56.133 --> 00:58.233
* You will discover

00:58.233 --> 01:02.333
* You can't judge
this cop by his cover

01:03.333 --> 01:05.132
* He's a super snooper

01:05.132 --> 01:07.133
* Really super trooper

01:07.133 --> 01:10.467
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw

01:10.467 --> 01:12.367
* He's a super snooper

01:12.367 --> 01:14.333
* Really super trooper

01:14.333 --> 01:18.500
* A wonder cop a roller
the side of the law

01:21.133 --> 01:22.800
* There's a stir

01:22.800 --> 01:24.533
* On the floor

01:24.533 --> 01:27.433
* Super snooper open the door

01:27.433 --> 01:30.267
* Didn't you know

01:30.267 --> 01:34.200

02:32.467 --> 02:35.400

like you never saw.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.667
In just about a quarter
of an hour's time,

02:37.667 --> 02:39.267
ex-police officer David Steed

02:39.267 --> 02:41.900
is to be submitted
to the supreme test.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.900
This will make the fourth time

02:43.900 --> 02:46.233
the state has tried
to execute him.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.033
He's been sentenced to death
for the murder of his friend,

02:49.033 --> 02:52.367
colleague and superior
officer, Sergeant Willy Dunlop.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.867
Never before in the
history of this country

02:54.867 --> 02:58.600
has a man survived three
attempts to execute him.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.333
First time was the gas chamber.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.067
But Dave breathed in the cyanide

03:02.067 --> 03:04.967
like it was pure,
pollution-free mountain air.

03:04.967 --> 03:08.200
The second attempt by the state
to have Dave meet his maker

03:08.200 --> 03:11.100
was by hanging, but
when Dave dropped,

03:11.100 --> 03:13.300
you guessed it, the rope broke.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.300
Then it was the firing squad.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.533
But inexplicably, not one single
bullet even scratched Dave.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.433
Now he's gonna get the chair.

03:22.433 --> 03:27.067
I'd like to see the son of
a bitch get out of that!

03:27.067 --> 03:28.467
Now he's gonna fry!

03:28.467 --> 03:30.633
(burping)

03:31.633 --> 03:34.133
(phone beeps)

03:35.700 --> 03:36.700
Yeah?

03:36.700 --> 03:37.533
Oh.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.100
It's for you, boss.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.533
Hello Rosy.

03:44.533 --> 03:45.833
It's all arranged.

03:45.833 --> 03:50.167
Don't worry, nothing
can go wrong this time.

03:50.167 --> 03:53.767
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.567
You ask my husband, he
knows all about these things.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.833
Right Leopold?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.967
Leopold hardly says
a word these days,

03:59.967 --> 04:01.133
he's so depressed.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.667
He's against the death penalty.

04:03.667 --> 04:04.600
How about you, sir?

04:04.600 --> 04:05.867
How do you feel?

04:05.867 --> 04:07.933
I'm sure glad I'm
not in his place.

04:07.933 --> 04:10.667
I know he ain't
feeling too good.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.200
Sorry lady, no visitors today.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.867
But I have an invitation
signed by the governor.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.733
Hey, I don't care if it
was signed by the president,

04:19.733 --> 04:23.333
the warden said not let in
any complimentary passes.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.967
But don't you recognize me?

04:25.967 --> 04:27.367
I'm Rosy Labouche!

04:27.367 --> 04:30.200
The condemned man
and I were close.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.433
Real close.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.700
Lady, if you were the
condemned man himself

04:32.700 --> 04:33.933
I couldn't let you in.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.467
Well could you at least see

04:35.467 --> 04:37.400
that he receives these flowers?

04:37.400 --> 04:39.433
Perhaps they could arrange them

04:39.433 --> 04:42.800
in front of the electric
chair, so he could see them?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
I want David to
be thinking of me

04:45.200 --> 04:48.233
when they throw the switch.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.000
I'll see what I can do.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.233
Oh, you are so kind!

04:52.233 --> 04:53.733
Thank you so much.

05:06.533 --> 05:07.600
Hi Jackson.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.100
Dave, that's the 14th
plate of beans you've eaten!

05:13.100 --> 05:14.733
Would you like
something to drink?

05:14.733 --> 05:16.800
You know, regulations say
you can have champagne

05:16.800 --> 05:18.333
if you want it.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.467
Champagne?

05:19.467 --> 05:20.667
Gives me gas.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.567
Well can I get
you something else?

05:22.567 --> 05:24.400
Yeah, more beans.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.567
More beans?

05:25.567 --> 05:26.767
Uh huh.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.967
Could you make it a
zookie beans this time?

05:28.967 --> 05:29.967
Zookie beans?

05:29.967 --> 05:31.467
I never heard of them,

05:31.467 --> 05:33.367
but I guess I can get the
cook to rustle some up.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.100
Great, I'll have
'em for lunch.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.300
Lunch?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.000
Hey man, they're
coming for you now.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.600
By the time lunchtime
rolls around,

05:40.600 --> 05:44.767
you're gonna be having
dinner with honky number one.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.300
You may go.

05:47.300 --> 05:50.100
There's no need to make
your confessions, my son.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.967
What Earthly sins could
you have committed

05:51.967 --> 05:53.800
since we last took
this walk together

05:53.800 --> 05:56.667
the day before yesterday?

05:56.667 --> 05:59.567
Well, how about
gluttony, Father?

06:00.367 --> 06:01.767
I absolve you.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.700
Now come along, my son.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.833
[Speed] When all
this first began,

06:11.833 --> 06:14.267
I never dreamt it
would end this way.

06:14.267 --> 06:16.467
I had just come out
of the police academy

06:16.467 --> 06:18.967
and received my first
solo assignment.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.400
It seems like only yesterday.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.433
As you know, red
plutonium will re-enter

06:45.433 --> 06:47.867
the Earth's atmosphere and
will plunge and plummet

06:47.867 --> 06:50.600
with pinpoint precision
to a pre-determined place

06:50.600 --> 06:52.000
on the Earth's surface.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.733
The purpose of red
plutonium's mission

06:53.733 --> 06:55.600
is to test the
top-secret device,

06:55.600 --> 06:58.033
detecting minerals
below the moon's crust.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.700
Now gentlemen, the site selected

06:59.700 --> 07:03.133
for this momentous experiment
is namely Creektown,

07:03.133 --> 07:05.867
or as the Indians
call it, Poboke.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.833
Whose inhabitants, by the way,

07:07.833 --> 07:11.667
have proved themselves to be
patriotic, true blue Americans,

07:11.667 --> 07:14.600
and are here to share with
us this historic moment.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.200
(bright music)

07:20.533 --> 07:23.200
[Speed] Sergeant Dunlop
had ordered me to proceed

07:23.200 --> 07:24.933
to Creektown to collect the fine

07:24.933 --> 07:27.100
for non-payment of
a parking ticket.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.567
Even though the village was
in the middle of a swamp

07:29.567 --> 07:31.867
and I had to leave my
wheels on dry ground,

07:31.867 --> 07:36.033
I was hell-bent on carrying
out my mission no matter what.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.233
This is headquarters
calling Officer Speed.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.167
Headquarters calling
Officer Speed.

07:51.167 --> 07:53.100
Come in, Officer Speed.

07:57.533 --> 08:00.433
This is Sergeant Dunlop
calling Officer Speed.

08:00.433 --> 08:02.300
Officer Speed, do you read me?

08:02.300 --> 08:03.533
Over.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.033
Oh that was good
thinking, Sergeant.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.333
Sending him across the Glades
to Creektown on the very day.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.900
NASA's having their top-secret
experiments out there.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.867
(chuckling) That's really smart.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.700
Well how was I to
know that, Chief?

08:13.700 --> 08:17.800
I mean, you yourself just
said it was top-secret!

08:19.800 --> 08:22.600
What would have happened to
the population of Creektown

08:22.600 --> 08:24.833
had the citizens not
been evacuated in time?

08:24.833 --> 08:26.300
Well, probably nothing.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.500
The explosion of red plutonium

08:28.500 --> 08:30.533
will bombard the Earth's surface

08:30.533 --> 08:33.000
with a barrage of
harmless red amoeba rays,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.167
which will have the
effect of floroscoping

08:35.167 --> 08:37.332
whatever lies underground.

09:01.033 --> 09:02.433
Mr. Jim Polaka?

09:05.500 --> 09:06.767
Mr. Jim Polaka?

09:06.767 --> 09:07.600
Hello?

09:12.067 --> 09:13.167
Anybody home?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.267
This is Officer Speed
calling headquarters.

09:22.267 --> 09:23.967
Hey, Sergeant Dunlop.

09:23.967 --> 09:24.900
It's Dave!

09:24.900 --> 09:26.100
It's him!

09:26.100 --> 09:27.533
He's coming through
our short wave!

09:27.533 --> 09:29.767
We can hear him, but
he can't hear us.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.433
It's a freak reception.

09:31.433 --> 09:32.267
Speed!

09:32.267 --> 09:34.300
Speed, you dumb rookie!

09:34.300 --> 09:36.367
Get back here right away!

09:36.367 --> 09:38.267
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

09:38.267 --> 09:40.400
Get back to headquarters,
do you hear me?

09:40.400 --> 09:41.667
This is urgent!

09:41.667 --> 09:43.000
Hey, it's really
peaceful out here.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.333
You know what, Sarge?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.767
I'm gonna enter his domicile

09:45.767 --> 09:48.933
and tack the ticket
to his totem pole.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.067
All systems.

09:58.033 --> 10:00.200
(beeping)

10:04.933 --> 10:08.033
Assignment completed,
over and out.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.133
(growling)

10:13.133 --> 10:15.133
(gasps)

10:19.133 --> 10:19.967
Hey fella.

10:21.433 --> 10:22.733
Hey fella.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.400
Could you move over?

10:26.400 --> 10:27.867
Scat!

10:27.867 --> 10:28.700
Scat!

10:29.767 --> 10:30.600
Git, git!

10:30.600 --> 10:32.833
(growling)

10:49.167 --> 10:52.133
(gun firing)

10:52.133 --> 10:54.400
(blasting)

11:08.367 --> 11:10.033
Oh, that poor kid.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.533
He wasn't much of a
rookie in his class,

11:15.533 --> 11:18.433
but he did die in
the line of duty,

11:19.633 --> 11:23.467
trying to collect on
a traffic violation.

11:23.467 --> 11:24.633
That poor kid.

11:25.767 --> 11:29.767
Little late to be
feeling sorry, isn't it?

11:29.767 --> 11:31.000
I'll tell you what.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.133
If it scares you that much,

11:33.133 --> 11:37.067
I've got just the job to
take it off your mind,

11:37.067 --> 11:38.333
Officer Dunlop.

11:47.867 --> 11:50.200
(whistling)

12:00.000 --> 12:02.333
(car honks)

12:18.833 --> 12:20.667
Come on, Sergeant!

12:20.667 --> 12:23.000
(whistling)

12:45.633 --> 12:46.633
The Sarge!

12:50.033 --> 12:50.933
Hey, Sarge!

13:11.367 --> 13:13.500
I could hardly believe it.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.667
I got the cover back into place
just by thinking about it.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.333
But then I realized
something incredible,

13:21.333 --> 13:24.900
something extraordinary
had happened to me.

13:26.733 --> 13:29.667
(triumphant music)

13:47.333 --> 13:50.033
To start with, we'll
forget all that baloney

13:50.033 --> 13:51.533
you told the Chief.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.233
As far as I'm concerned, you
never went to that creek.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.900
But I did go, Sarge.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.133
Then how come you never
noticed all that hell

13:58.133 --> 13:59.933
that was breaking
loose around you?

13:59.933 --> 14:00.867
I did.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.667
It was this huge explosion.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.100
Louder than I can
do with my bubble.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.300
Your what?

14:06.300 --> 14:08.200
Listen, don't give
me that bubble stuff!

14:08.200 --> 14:12.100
Not even an ant could have
survived in that explosion!

14:12.100 --> 14:13.967
Why are you getting so mad?

14:13.967 --> 14:15.933
Sounds like you're
sorry I'm still alive.

14:15.933 --> 14:17.433
Well what do you expect?

14:17.433 --> 14:19.267
If a man gets caught in the
middle of an atomic blast,

14:19.267 --> 14:21.533
the least he could
do is drop dead!

14:21.533 --> 14:22.667
But I told you, Sarge.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.533
Everything turned bright red,

14:24.533 --> 14:26.267
there was this roaring sound,

14:26.267 --> 14:29.433
next thing I knew, I came
to under a mountain of sand.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.133
A mountain of sand.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.633
That's a good one.

14:33.733 --> 14:36.000
(gum popping)

14:36.000 --> 14:39.433
That's a revolting habit,
and it's against regulations!

14:39.433 --> 14:41.500
And what's more, it
turns my stomach!

14:41.500 --> 14:42.333
What does?

14:42.333 --> 14:43.600
Chewing gum.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.967
Any turkey that chews
gum and blows bubbles

14:45.967 --> 14:49.033
is really at the
top of my list, boy.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.533
Right there you gotta put it?

14:56.533 --> 14:57.967
Oh, you dope.

14:57.967 --> 14:59.133
Sorry Sarge.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.100
I mean, no offense.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.733
I'm one of Rosy
Labouche's greatest fans.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.500
I've seen all of her movies.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.933
Even the silent ones.

15:09.933 --> 15:12.033
What do you mean,
even the silent ones?

15:12.033 --> 15:13.533
She's young enough to make

15:13.533 --> 15:16.067
that Cheryl Ladd
and Farrah Fawcett

15:16.067 --> 15:18.533
look like a couple
of plain Janes.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.967
You're really crazy
about her, eh Sarge?

15:20.967 --> 15:25.067
Sure I'm crazy about her,
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

15:25.067 --> 15:28.500
Did I ever tell you about the
time I held her in my arms?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.933
That was a long time
ago, in Hollywood.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.867
I was working as a stuntman
on one of her films.

15:35.867 --> 15:40.600
Oh boy, that's an experience
I'll never forget.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.100
Watch it, Sarge!

15:43.600 --> 15:47.067
What the hell are you
trying to do, kill us?

15:47.067 --> 15:50.133
I didn't want you
to hit the elephants.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.533
What elephants?

16:00.300 --> 16:01.133
Those.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.667
How did you know
those elephants

16:13.667 --> 16:15.400
were gonna cross in front of us?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.500
I didn't see them.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.533
That means you didn't either.

16:18.533 --> 16:20.067
I don't know.

16:20.067 --> 16:20.900
Intuition.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.000
Oh yeah?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.867
So who's gonna cross in
front of us now, huh?

16:25.867 --> 16:29.433
Come on, give us a
flash of that intuition.

16:30.833 --> 16:31.667
Come on!

16:38.567 --> 16:39.400
I can't.

16:43.767 --> 16:46.267
Elephants yes, nuns no, huh?

16:47.367 --> 16:48.200
Aw.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.032
Be right back.

17:35.733 --> 17:36.733
Hi Uncle Willy.

17:36.733 --> 17:38.333
With Dave again, huh?

17:38.333 --> 17:42.500
Hello, never mind about
Dave and give me my lunch.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.900
(honking)

17:51.900 --> 17:54.400
(men yelling)

17:58.367 --> 17:59.200
Hey!

18:31.767 --> 18:34.967
* Super snooper

18:34.967 --> 18:38.400
* Super super super.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.367
Okay, see you later.

18:39.367 --> 18:40.367
Okay, bye.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.267
[Speed] No longer any
doubt, I had super powers.

19:15.267 --> 19:18.533
But they would come and
go for no apparent reason.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.767
I wanted to talk
to Sarge about it,

19:20.767 --> 19:22.933
but I couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.667
He wouldn't stop talking
about Rosy Labouche.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.933
And there was another time

19:26.933 --> 19:29.233
I was playing the
Russian centurion.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.733
Russian centurion?

19:30.733 --> 19:33.900
No no, Roman
centurion. (Laughing)

19:33.900 --> 19:35.167
Oh, yeah.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.733
And I was supposed
to dive in the water

19:36.733 --> 19:39.533
to save her from a whole
bunch of crocodiles, right?

19:39.533 --> 19:41.633
Well I had all this
armor plate on me,

19:41.633 --> 19:44.267
and I sank right down to
the bottom like a stone.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.767
Yeah, what happened?

19:45.767 --> 19:47.533
Well I nearly drowned.

19:47.533 --> 19:50.367
Yes sir, those
were the days, boy.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.733
Answer the radio.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.200
What? There's
nobody calling us.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.067
[Radio] This is
headquarters calling car 40.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.933
Headquarters calling
car 40, come in car 40.

19:59.933 --> 20:00.933
Intuition.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.133
This is car 40,
come in Tiger Lilly.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.033
[Radio] Head over
to 11474th Street,

20:07.033 --> 20:09.067
we have a robbery in
progress on the 20th floor

20:09.067 --> 20:10.567
of the offices of
Johnson & Johnson,

20:10.567 --> 20:12.300
that's right across from
the Daily Herald building.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.867
We're on our way!

20:16.967 --> 20:18.767
You know, you and this intuition

20:18.767 --> 20:21.933
are starting to get
on my nerves, kid.

20:27.467 --> 20:28.300
Don't move!

20:28.300 --> 20:29.267
Nobody move!

20:29.267 --> 20:30.433
Get over here!

20:31.600 --> 20:33.433
Come on, get 'em up!

20:40.133 --> 20:41.233
Oh hi Sarge!

20:41.233 --> 20:42.833
Silvius, what's up?

20:42.833 --> 20:43.933
Oh, I don't know nothing.

20:43.933 --> 20:45.267
What's going on?

20:54.333 --> 20:56.000
They've blocked them all.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.400
Now we gotta climb all that way.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.200
Come on!

21:02.133 --> 21:02.967
Hurry up!

21:02.967 --> 21:04.800
Let's get out of here!

21:10.733 --> 21:13.233
We're almost there, come on!

21:24.700 --> 21:25.933
Only five more.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.633
Wait a minute, Sarge.

21:39.633 --> 21:40.467
There.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.933
Here's what we're gonna
use, the old charge system.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.400
What's a charge system?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.867
It never fails, the
old charge system.

21:51.867 --> 21:55.933
You charge the door and I'll
cover you from the back here.

21:55.933 --> 21:56.767
Okay?

21:56.767 --> 21:58.233
I charge the door?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.767
You charge the door, I'm
gonna cover you from back here.

22:00.767 --> 22:02.700
Good thinking, Sarge.

22:04.367 --> 22:08.667
Check the door and
see if anybody's coming.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.333
(screaming)

22:11.333 --> 22:14.000
* Super snooper.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.500
Beautiful!

22:21.467 --> 22:23.167
Fantastic, beautiful!

22:23.167 --> 22:26.600
It brings tears to my eyes
to see a trick like that.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.667
Oh, really?

22:34.633 --> 22:35.900
Grab his gun.

22:37.867 --> 22:39.100
I say.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.833
Somebody better
get an ambulance.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.767
That boy's gonna
be hurt awful bad.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.000
Don't move or you'll
end up like your buddy.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.400
Watch the door, there
might be more cops.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.300
Hey Sarge, it's over.

23:05.167 --> 23:06.000
Huh?

23:06.000 --> 23:06.833
Yeah.

23:10.633 --> 23:12.633
(gasps)

23:21.267 --> 23:23.600
Boy, somebody up
there sure likes you.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.767
If it hadn't been for
that platform down there,

23:25.767 --> 23:30.567
you'd have been splattered
all over that sidewalk.

23:30.567 --> 23:33.033
But what took you so
long to get back up here!

23:33.033 --> 23:34.400
Forget it Sarge.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.100
If I told you, you
wouldn't believe me anyway.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.600
All right, get 'em up there!

23:44.467 --> 23:45.467
(laughing)

23:45.467 --> 23:47.167
What are you so happy about?

23:47.167 --> 23:49.800
I'm happy about the way
we busted up that robbery.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.133
If you stick with me,
we're gonna go places.

23:52.133 --> 23:54.533
(sirens blaring)

23:54.533 --> 23:56.067
What now?

23:56.067 --> 23:58.633
There's illegal gambling
going on in that truck!

23:58.633 --> 23:59.467
Gambling?

24:11.333 --> 24:12.267
Put 'em up!

24:15.233 --> 24:16.800
All right, get out!

24:19.133 --> 24:20.067
(knocking)

24:20.067 --> 24:21.400
Police, open up!

24:23.967 --> 24:27.200
(people gasping)

24:27.200 --> 24:30.100
Nobody move,
you're under arrest.

24:31.367 --> 24:32.833
I called headquarters.

24:32.833 --> 24:35.500
Hey kid, next time you
get a tip-off like this,

24:35.500 --> 24:37.733
tell me before
you act, will you?

24:37.733 --> 24:38.967
It wasn't a tip-off.

24:38.967 --> 24:40.133
I looked at the
side of the truck...

24:40.133 --> 24:41.567
Look, I don't wanna know.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.133
I'm just your superior officer.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.033
From now on, you don't
think, you don't act,

24:45.033 --> 24:48.067
you don't speak until you get
it from me, you understand?

24:48.067 --> 24:50.067
Get your hands up there!

24:54.267 --> 24:56.533
(cheering)

25:08.567 --> 25:09.933
Come on, let's go!

25:09.933 --> 25:11.467
All right!

25:11.467 --> 25:13.667
Dave, you're not even
watching the game!

25:13.667 --> 25:15.533
Aw I know, I bet
you're thinking about

25:15.533 --> 25:18.633
racing around in your car and
catching crooks, aren't you?

25:18.633 --> 25:19.900
No.

25:19.900 --> 25:23.100
Well then what are
you thinking about?

25:26.100 --> 25:27.333
Well.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.033
I was just thinking
how much I'd like

25:29.033 --> 25:30.533
to be alone with you right now.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.133
(laughing) In this crowd?

25:32.133 --> 25:32.967
Sure.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.833
(cheering)

25:51.200 --> 25:52.300
What crowd?

26:05.400 --> 26:08.067
(intense music)

26:14.200 --> 26:16.633
Look, there's a little
job I gotta take care of,

26:16.633 --> 26:17.800
be right back.

27:12.867 --> 27:15.300
(struggling)

27:18.367 --> 27:20.967
You're under arrest, Scardella.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.967
I don't know how you did it.

27:33.967 --> 27:37.267
We've been after Scardella
for over two years.

27:37.267 --> 27:41.433
I still don't see how you
spotted him in all that crowd.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.567
Well Sarge, I wanted
to be alone with Evelyn,

27:45.567 --> 27:48.033
even though I know
you don't approve.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.333
So I had everyone disappear.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.233
And there we were,
Evelyn, Scardella and me.

27:53.233 --> 27:55.467
You had everybody disappear?

27:55.467 --> 27:57.167
You want me to believe that?

27:57.167 --> 27:58.233
It's the truth.

27:58.233 --> 27:59.367
Now look, you!

27:59.367 --> 28:01.333
You stop this
nonsense or so help me

28:01.333 --> 28:04.667
you're gonna be driving a
garbage truck, you got it?

28:04.667 --> 28:05.500
Got it.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.333
Good!

28:09.067 --> 28:09.900
Disappear.

28:25.533 --> 28:26.700
You just hit a driver.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.933
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

28:28.933 --> 28:30.067
Hold it right there.

28:30.067 --> 28:30.900
Hey!

28:33.300 --> 28:34.633
Drop your gun!

28:35.700 --> 28:38.033
For God's sake, shoot him!

28:41.233 --> 28:44.233
(panicked shouting)

28:55.467 --> 28:57.833
Get back, get out
of here all of you.

28:57.833 --> 28:59.967
Hold it right there.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.133
Stop!

29:01.133 --> 29:03.067
Relax, the game's over.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.733
(gun firing)

29:15.733 --> 29:16.567
Shit!

29:18.700 --> 29:19.533
Hold it!

29:19.533 --> 29:21.133
Drop the gun.

29:21.133 --> 29:21.967
Hold it!

29:24.633 --> 29:26.633
First thing tomorrow morning,

29:26.633 --> 29:28.967
you go back to the firing range.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.433
You never even hit him once.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.433
Let me have those cuffs.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.767
Get 'em up there!

29:36.733 --> 29:38.167
Come on, back there.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.000
Come on!

29:41.467 --> 29:44.800
[Speed] Poor Sarge, how
could I tell him the truth?

29:44.800 --> 29:47.900
* Super snooper

29:47.900 --> 29:51.167
* Super super super

29:51.167 --> 29:53.933
(cheering)

29:53.933 --> 29:56.100
What made you suspect
that there was a robbery

29:56.100 --> 29:57.900
taking place here,
Officer Dunlop?

29:57.900 --> 29:59.633
Oh well, my partner and I,

29:59.633 --> 30:01.700
we were passing by
the supermarket,

30:01.700 --> 30:03.600
and well, the first
thing you know,

30:03.600 --> 30:06.800
well we spotted the suspect
sitting in a getaway car,

30:06.800 --> 30:07.933
and well...

30:07.933 --> 30:09.233
Thank you Chief.

30:09.233 --> 30:12.433
Anything you would care
to add, Officer Speed?

30:12.433 --> 30:13.433
Not really.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.300
Sergeant Dunlop has said it all.

30:15.300 --> 30:17.767
I'm just fortunate to be
teamed with such a man.

30:17.767 --> 30:21.233
[Reporter] Chief, you must
be awfully proud of these men.

30:21.233 --> 30:24.533
Well I'll tell you, it all
comes from years of dedication,

30:24.533 --> 30:27.967
hard work, and a city
that I've lived in.

30:27.967 --> 30:28.900
Paradise?

30:28.900 --> 30:30.433
Yes boss.

30:30.433 --> 30:33.967
Those two cops are getting
too big for their britches.

30:33.967 --> 30:34.933
Why worry?

30:34.933 --> 30:36.700
They can't pin anything on you.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.867
What you do is legal
and above the board.

30:39.867 --> 30:41.433
(laughing)

30:41.433 --> 30:44.200
You got the richest fishing
business in the golf course.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.900
(laughing) Yeah.

30:45.900 --> 30:49.567
Call the Barracuda, I
want a partner's report.

30:49.567 --> 30:52.567
Sandy, Mr. Torpedo's
on the phone.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.200
Yeah, hello, boss?

31:00.200 --> 31:02.833
Yeah, everything's
going like clockwork.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.867
Yeah, we're shipping out
a hundred brands worth

31:04.867 --> 31:07.533
of George Washingtons right now.

31:11.067 --> 31:12.567
Hey, Sarge!

31:12.567 --> 31:15.500
It says here that your Rosy
Labouche is making a comeback.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.533
Did you know that?

31:16.533 --> 31:17.700
Sure I knew that.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.133
I know everything about Rosy.

31:22.733 --> 31:24.267
Like a cup of coffee?

31:24.267 --> 31:26.000
Yeah, black please.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.633
(mystical music)

31:51.733 --> 31:53.500
Hey, Sarge, I did it!

31:53.500 --> 31:55.033
Did what?

31:55.033 --> 31:58.600
I had the cup fly over to
me just by thinking about it!

31:58.600 --> 31:59.800
Yeah Sarge!

31:59.800 --> 32:01.333
Look, I wanna
tell you something.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.400
You cannot go around
telling people

32:03.400 --> 32:05.367
that you have cups
flying into your hand!

32:05.367 --> 32:07.067
That you can look through
walls and see elephants.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.000
Sarge.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.200
[Dunlop] You understand me?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.100
Hey Sarge, that truck.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.533
It's carrying counterfeit bills.

32:13.533 --> 32:14.367
What?

32:14.367 --> 32:15.500
How do you know?

32:15.500 --> 32:18.067
Well, I saw through the side.

32:20.033 --> 32:23.700
Come on, we're gonna
go take a look, come on!

32:23.700 --> 32:26.467
(whistling)

32:26.467 --> 32:28.800
Open up this truck, come on!

32:28.800 --> 32:30.067
Okay, man.

32:30.067 --> 32:31.700
All right, let's go,
open it up back here.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.867
You want me to open it up?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.367
Just open it up.

32:35.633 --> 32:37.733
What do you got in there?

32:41.067 --> 32:41.900
Fish.

32:56.967 --> 32:59.167
All right, close it down.

33:02.033 --> 33:03.000
Go ahead, beat it.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.100
Okay, okay.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.933
Counterfeit bills.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.000
All I saw in there were fish!

33:24.000 --> 33:26.333
Now I'm not saying they
weren't counterfeit fish.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.533
But even if they were,
there's no law against it!

33:29.533 --> 33:30.533
Or is there?

33:32.967 --> 33:35.867
(mellow pop music)

33:40.667 --> 33:43.700
Dave, I've been thinking
about the stadium.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.667
You know, I mush have
been really crazy

33:45.667 --> 33:47.633
to think that
everyone disappeared.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.600
You're not crazy, Evelyn.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.767
Everyone did disappear.

33:51.767 --> 33:53.367
Oh come on, Dave.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.033
Evelyn.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.067
I have to tell you something.

34:00.467 --> 34:03.800
I'm, well, how can I put this.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.800
I'm not normal any more.

34:06.767 --> 34:08.067
I'm different.

34:08.067 --> 34:09.467
Dave.

34:09.467 --> 34:14.199
Oh come on Evelyn, not
that kind of different.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.199
You see, ever since
I went to Creektown

34:17.199 --> 34:19.100
and got caught in
that explosion,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.467
something happened inside me.

34:21.467 --> 34:22.933
It's like,

34:22.933 --> 34:26.300
it's like a part of me over
which I have no control,

34:26.300 --> 34:29.067
was suddenly switched on.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.300
Dave darling, I
won't pretend I know

34:31.300 --> 34:33.033
what you're talking about,

34:33.033 --> 34:35.167
but why don't we
discuss that later?

34:35.167 --> 34:37.167
And I'll go put
on my bathing suit

34:37.167 --> 34:38.433
and let's go in the water.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.667
You go ahead, I can't swim.

34:40.667 --> 34:43.400
I grew up in the
mountains, remember?

34:43.400 --> 34:45.333
Well, don't worry about it.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.533
I'll teach you.

34:46.533 --> 34:47.367
Okay.

34:52.766 --> 34:55.766
(children laughing)

35:34.067 --> 35:35.300
Hey kids!

35:35.300 --> 35:37.833
Don't worry, I'll
get it for you.

35:44.467 --> 35:46.967
Whoa, he's walking on water!

35:57.500 --> 35:59.767
(screaming)

36:01.200 --> 36:02.033
David!

36:04.667 --> 36:05.900
[Speed] Help!

36:08.467 --> 36:09.300
Help!

36:12.667 --> 36:14.100
It's all right.

36:17.000 --> 36:17.833
Wow.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.367
Come on, come on Dave.

36:23.367 --> 36:25.533
(gasping)

36:27.800 --> 36:30.133
We're almost there.

36:30.133 --> 36:32.133
I can't, I can't swim!

36:33.000 --> 36:33.833
David?

36:33.833 --> 36:34.667
Oh my God.

36:40.433 --> 36:44.100
Hey, why don't you
give him mouth to mouth?

36:44.100 --> 36:45.767
Yeah, okay, great.

37:30.567 --> 37:33.233
(phone ringing)

37:36.300 --> 37:37.900
Hi Sarge, what's up?

37:37.900 --> 37:39.700
How did you know it was me?

37:39.700 --> 37:41.933
No no, don't tell
me, let me guess.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.467
Listen you, I want you
over here right away

37:44.467 --> 37:47.300
so you can tell the Chief
exactly what you been telling me

37:47.300 --> 37:49.967
about all that super
power stuff, you got it?

37:49.967 --> 37:54.100
And you got five minutes to
get here, you understand?

37:54.100 --> 37:55.300
Five minutes, Sergeant?

37:55.300 --> 37:58.167
He lives on the
other side of town.

37:58.167 --> 38:00.300
Reporting for duty, sir.

38:01.867 --> 38:03.433
You see that, Chief?

38:03.433 --> 38:04.767
You see that?

38:04.767 --> 38:06.533
Those are the cute little tricks

38:06.533 --> 38:08.467
I gotta put up with
every single day!

38:08.467 --> 38:09.467
Well I've had it!

38:09.467 --> 38:10.867
I've had it right up to here!

38:10.867 --> 38:12.800
But Sergeant, you're
the one who gave him

38:12.800 --> 38:14.467
only five minutes to get here.

38:14.467 --> 38:16.633
Well then he's got
an answering service,

38:16.633 --> 38:18.067
that's what he's got!

38:18.067 --> 38:20.667
That's not true, Sarge.

38:20.667 --> 38:21.700
At ease, Sergeant.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.700
At ease.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.233
You know, Officer Speed,

38:24.233 --> 38:27.600
I've always enjoyed a
good practical joke too.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.067
Well I've been known in my
day to play a couple myself.

38:31.067 --> 38:32.633
I'll never forget one time,

38:32.633 --> 38:34.833
right after I came
out of police college,

38:34.833 --> 38:37.067
I painted myself
green head to toe

38:37.067 --> 38:41.100
to pretend to be a
Martian! (Laughing)

38:41.100 --> 38:42.233
Yeah, that's right.

38:42.233 --> 38:43.933
But he had be almost believing

38:43.933 --> 38:47.133
that he fell 20 floors
without hurting himself!

38:47.133 --> 38:49.700
Oh, that doesn't
sound possible to me.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.500
It doesn't sound possible?

38:52.500 --> 38:53.333
Huh.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.900
Let me show you something.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.567
Be right back.

39:10.733 --> 39:13.400
* Super snooper.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.400
What happened?

39:25.167 --> 39:26.233
Call an ambulance.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.733
Yes sir.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.633
Don't touch him, wait
'til the medic gets here.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.667
What, what, what...

39:39.633 --> 39:41.133
As you can see from this X-ray

39:41.133 --> 39:43.667
taken right after his
admission this morning,

39:43.667 --> 39:46.033
there isn't an unbroken
bone in his body!

39:46.033 --> 39:48.533
Beats me how he's still alive.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.567
Sarge.

39:50.567 --> 39:52.467
Yeah kid, what is it?

39:52.467 --> 39:56.033
I don't want, I don't want
Evelyn to see me this way.

39:56.033 --> 39:56.867
Oh okay.

39:56.867 --> 39:57.800
All right.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.933
What did he say?

39:58.933 --> 40:00.433
Nothing, nothing.

40:00.433 --> 40:02.567
Listen honey, why don't
we wait outside over here.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.167
There's really
nothing we can do,

40:04.167 --> 40:05.967
and we might as well get out.

40:05.967 --> 40:09.000
We took other X-rays after
we put him in his cast.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
They should be ready soon.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.800
But I'm afraid that, well even
if the bone's set correctly,

40:14.800 --> 40:18.967
the internal damage is too
extensive to encourage optimism.

40:19.867 --> 40:21.533
If you'll excuse me.

40:26.700 --> 40:29.733
[Chief] Why did you
do it, Officer Speed?

40:29.733 --> 40:32.300
Were you that
unhappy on the force?

40:32.300 --> 40:33.133
Chief.

40:33.133 --> 40:34.333
What?

40:34.333 --> 40:35.267
The door.

40:44.167 --> 40:46.000
What about the door?

40:52.433 --> 40:54.100
It's a miracle,
it's a miracle!

40:54.100 --> 40:57.167
Look, we took another set
of X-rays of Officer Speed.

40:57.167 --> 40:59.000
The bones are completely healed!

40:59.000 --> 41:00.367
It's a miracle!

41:00.367 --> 41:01.700
Dave!

41:01.700 --> 41:03.400
Dave, it's a miracle!

41:03.400 --> 41:04.900
The doctor said...

41:05.900 --> 41:06.733
Dave?

41:07.800 --> 41:08.633
Dave!

41:12.800 --> 41:13.633
Dave.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.333
Oh Dave.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.400
Oh sorry Chief.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.233
Chief?

41:26.733 --> 41:29.567
(fun disco music)

41:37.000 --> 41:40.400
[Speed] I'd been looking
for Silvius all day.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.167
He was the only person
who had seen my two falls.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.400
I had a hunch he could explain

41:44.400 --> 41:47.067
what went wrong the second time.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.400
Step right up, ladies and
gentlemen, see the elephant.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.233
One please.

41:57.233 --> 41:58.033
Seven.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.433
Thank you, 750 pounds.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.033
Alive, ladies and gentlemen,

42:01.033 --> 42:02.067
thank you very much.

42:02.067 --> 42:03.600
You always work here?

42:03.600 --> 42:06.500
I guess if you call peddling
tickets all day long working,

42:06.500 --> 42:07.733
yeah I am, why?

42:07.733 --> 42:10.300
I'm looking for an
old guy named Silvius.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.333
I heard he worked
here a couple times.

42:12.333 --> 42:13.933
What's it to you?

42:16.533 --> 42:18.467
Oh yeah, Silvius, I know him.

42:18.467 --> 42:21.400
He's a ventriloquist,
really a great talent.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.967
You wanna know something?

42:22.967 --> 42:26.200
He can actually make a doggy
talk like a human being.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.500
I think he's had it a
little rough lately.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.000
What do you mean?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Well, for the last year, I
haven't seen him around here.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.267
That's quite a while.

42:33.267 --> 42:36.400
I think he owes somebody
some money or something.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.067
You got any idea
where he lives?

42:38.067 --> 42:39.900
Well last time I
heard, he was living

42:39.900 --> 42:42.800
over on River Road,
in an old shack,

42:42.800 --> 42:44.967
selling dogs or something.

42:46.233 --> 42:47.367
Thanks.

42:47.367 --> 42:48.567
Hey mister.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.633
I didn't think
nothing at the time,

42:50.633 --> 42:53.467
but a little while ago there
were three guys over here,

42:53.467 --> 42:54.467
asking about him.

42:54.467 --> 42:55.933
What did you tell them?

42:55.933 --> 42:57.967
Same thing I told you.

42:57.967 --> 42:59.200
Thanks again.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.033
That's all right.

43:02.033 --> 43:04.633
(dogs barking)

43:24.100 --> 43:25.167
Hey Silvius!

43:25.167 --> 43:26.233
Anybody home?

43:28.067 --> 43:28.900
Silvius?

43:42.333 --> 43:43.167
Hey boy.

43:43.167 --> 43:44.200
Want a biscuit?

43:44.200 --> 43:45.267
There you go.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.600
Hey Silvius.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.433
Hello?

44:56.867 --> 44:57.667
Silvius!

44:57.667 --> 44:59.667
Hey Silvius, you here?

44:59.667 --> 45:01.067
Search the joint.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.200
What are we looking
for, Paradise?

45:07.200 --> 45:11.200
30,000 that Mr. Torpedo paid
for the talking chihuahua.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.067
Chihauhaus don't talk!

45:13.067 --> 45:15.400
That's why the boss
wants to get rid of it,

45:15.400 --> 45:19.000
and why he wants to
get rid of Silvius too.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.500
Find anything?

45:27.500 --> 45:28.900
Nothing, Paradise.

45:28.900 --> 45:30.733
Check in the closet.

45:32.767 --> 45:33.600
Hi.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.833
Hi.

45:34.833 --> 45:38.500
There's a guy in there,
but he isn't Silvius.

45:41.800 --> 45:42.633
Hi.

45:43.833 --> 45:45.067
Who are you?

45:45.067 --> 45:47.967
I know who I am, and
I know who you are.

45:47.967 --> 45:50.067
But do you know who he is?

45:50.067 --> 45:53.533
Hey, Paradise, I think
I've seen this guy on TV,

45:53.533 --> 45:58.033
but I can't remember whether
he's a singer or an evangelist.

45:58.033 --> 45:59.667
I don't care what he is.

45:59.667 --> 46:03.833
What are you doing here,
and where is Silvius?

46:03.833 --> 46:05.233
Beats me.

46:05.233 --> 46:07.933
But even if I knew, I
wouldn't tell you three jerks.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.167
What did he say?

46:09.167 --> 46:12.367
He said that we're
three jerks, Paradise.

46:12.367 --> 46:13.267
Uh, yeah.

46:14.300 --> 46:16.633
(screaming)

46:16.633 --> 46:17.700
He's yours.

46:20.300 --> 46:22.367
(groans)

46:25.133 --> 46:28.967
Two goes with the
guitar, then it's my turn.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.400
This is it.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.200
That's good, huh?

46:44.200 --> 46:46.300
You're the tops, Paradise!

46:46.300 --> 46:48.433
(groaning)

46:48.433 --> 46:49.267
Come on.

46:51.300 --> 46:53.400
He won't be back so soon.

46:54.833 --> 46:56.667
Hey, you guys going?

46:58.933 --> 47:02.000
I've gotta have a
chance to get even.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.067
Should I get the
guitar, Paradise?

47:04.067 --> 47:05.067
Don't get it.

47:05.067 --> 47:06.233
This is yours.

47:17.867 --> 47:20.767
I think you should let me
get the guitar, Paradise!

47:20.767 --> 47:21.767
It's okay.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.133
(struggling)

48:30.000 --> 48:32.267
(crashing)

48:41.633 --> 48:43.100
I told you,

48:43.100 --> 48:44.767
you should have let me
get the guitar, Paradise.

48:44.767 --> 48:47.200
Yeah, that's the best idea.

48:50.433 --> 48:53.600
(yelling and banging)

49:10.367 --> 49:12.433
(barking)

49:12.433 --> 49:14.933
Hey, go find a fire hydrant.

49:16.467 --> 49:17.967
Now be good, boys.

49:24.733 --> 49:26.767
[Announcer] Now here's a
flash for all you movie buffs.

49:26.767 --> 49:28.533
Famous film star Rosy Labouche

49:28.533 --> 49:31.167
will be arriving in our
fair city at four o'clock.

49:31.167 --> 49:33.367
(laughing)

49:33.367 --> 49:36.400
Miss Labouche will be appearing
every night this week.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.633
Hey fellas.

49:37.633 --> 49:38.833
Yes boss!

49:38.833 --> 49:42.233
Go to the airport
and pick her up.

49:42.233 --> 49:45.833
Did ya, did ya find the
old man with the dogs yet?

49:45.833 --> 49:46.667
No boss, we...

49:46.667 --> 49:48.133
Well find him!

49:48.133 --> 49:51.233
You know he and I got
some unfinished business!

49:51.233 --> 49:52.467
(burps)

49:52.467 --> 49:55.000
You know I got the
nervous stomach.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.567
You know that, don't you?

49:56.567 --> 49:58.100
Now go on, get outta here.

49:58.100 --> 50:00.233
Where you going? The back door!

50:00.233 --> 50:01.333
Sorry boss.

50:04.700 --> 50:06.633
How come you our
assignment changed

50:06.633 --> 50:08.700
to the sea plane
base today, Sarge?

50:08.700 --> 50:10.933
Well boy, I'll
tell you something.

50:10.933 --> 50:13.500
There are some people
who only fall in love

50:13.500 --> 50:14.967
one time in their life.

50:14.967 --> 50:17.033
I'm one of those lucky people.

50:17.033 --> 50:19.667
What the heck does that mean?

50:19.667 --> 50:22.167
Never mind, you'll find out.

50:26.633 --> 50:27.467
Hey.

50:30.533 --> 50:32.867
Those goons belong
to Tony Torpedo.

50:32.867 --> 50:35.633
They must have come
down to pick her up.

50:35.633 --> 50:36.633
Pick who up?

50:36.633 --> 50:38.400
Rosy Labouche, you dope.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.700
Oh.

50:39.700 --> 50:42.467
If only I could talk
to her, just once.

50:42.467 --> 50:43.733
Talk to her?

50:43.733 --> 50:45.933
What about that time you
held her in your arms?

50:45.933 --> 50:48.467
Well I, I, I just
helped her down

50:48.467 --> 50:51.133
from the stagecoach, that's all.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.033
(clapping)

50:55.033 --> 50:56.033
Thank you.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.967
Hey, here she comes.

50:59.967 --> 51:01.033
Yeah. Yeah.

51:07.033 --> 51:09.267
(laughing)

51:11.500 --> 51:12.933
Oh!

51:12.933 --> 51:14.600
Isn't she beautiful?

51:15.867 --> 51:19.000
Oh, if only I could talk to her.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.400
Sarge, I'll fix it for you.

51:22.600 --> 51:23.533
No!

51:23.533 --> 51:25.267
No no no, you stay out of this!

51:25.267 --> 51:27.300
Don't worry, no superpowers.

51:27.300 --> 51:30.800
Just take the patrol
car over to arrivals.

51:32.633 --> 51:35.267
Hey, that's the guy we
met at Silvius' house.

51:35.267 --> 51:36.367
Yes.

51:36.367 --> 51:37.867
That's all we need.

51:37.867 --> 51:38.700
Let's go.

51:41.367 --> 51:44.033
Your driver's license, please.

51:45.267 --> 51:47.367
Please Officer,
we're in a hurry.

51:47.367 --> 51:49.267
We've got to pick up the lady.

51:49.267 --> 51:51.000
Registration, please.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.233
Give me the registration.

51:59.667 --> 52:01.033
(yells)

52:01.033 --> 52:02.533
What's the matter?

52:02.533 --> 52:03.467
My fingers!

52:03.467 --> 52:04.400
What about your fingers?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.700
They're stuck in this door!

52:06.700 --> 52:08.067
Oh yeah.

52:08.067 --> 52:09.833
You ought to be more careful.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.533
Get out of the car, all of you.

52:11.533 --> 52:13.800
Let's have a roadside test.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.800
[Reporter] Miss Labouche,
it's good to see you in town.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.000
Well thank you very much, yes,

52:23.000 --> 52:24.067
it's good to be here.

52:24.067 --> 52:25.733
(clapping)

52:25.733 --> 52:28.400
(camera clicks)

52:30.933 --> 52:32.700
Hold out your arms.

52:38.833 --> 52:40.400
Lift your left leg.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.367
I said your left leg!

52:47.900 --> 52:49.667
Now play angels.

52:49.667 --> 52:50.933
Play angels?

52:50.933 --> 52:52.700
Yeah, you know,
flag your wings.

52:52.700 --> 52:53.533
Like this?

52:53.533 --> 52:54.567
Right.

52:54.567 --> 52:55.400
Faster.

52:59.867 --> 53:00.700
Faster.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.433
Forget it, you'll never fly.

53:10.300 --> 53:11.967
Uh uh uh, your arms!

53:14.167 --> 53:15.833
Kick your right leg.

53:18.500 --> 53:19.333
Left.

53:21.067 --> 53:21.900
Right.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.867
Left.

53:24.867 --> 53:25.933
Right.

53:25.933 --> 53:27.033
Left.

53:27.033 --> 53:27.867
Right.

53:27.867 --> 53:29.200
(fun circus music)

53:29.200 --> 53:30.767
Left, right.

53:30.767 --> 53:32.200
Good, keep it up.

53:45.900 --> 53:46.900
Thank you.

53:49.400 --> 53:53.000
Pardon me, but, may I
be of help, Miss Labouche?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.933
Oh, you know my
name, Sergeant.

53:54.933 --> 53:55.933
Everybody does.

53:55.933 --> 53:57.500
You may not remember me,

53:57.500 --> 53:59.433
but I worked in a
few of your films!

53:59.433 --> 54:01.467
And I'll never forget it.

54:01.467 --> 54:02.467
Sergeant.

54:02.467 --> 54:03.400
Yes!

54:03.400 --> 54:04.633
Would you do me a favor?

54:04.633 --> 54:06.433
Anything, just ask.

54:06.433 --> 54:08.900
I must be in my hotel
within 10 minutes.

54:08.900 --> 54:11.733
I'm expecting a very
important phone call.

54:11.733 --> 54:15.900
I would consider it an
honor if I could take you!

54:15.900 --> 54:16.733
My bags.

54:17.600 --> 54:20.133
Are you married, Sergeant?

54:20.133 --> 54:21.300
Uh, I, I,

54:21.300 --> 54:23.233
I've always been
dedicated to my work,

54:23.233 --> 54:24.767
and to my mother.

54:24.767 --> 54:27.033
But then I got into
motion pictures,

54:27.033 --> 54:29.233
oh watch your scarf ma'am,

54:30.500 --> 54:32.700
and then I got into work there,

54:32.700 --> 54:35.433
and I was never
much of an actor,

54:35.433 --> 54:39.433
but I always liked to do
a lot of stunts, you see.

54:39.433 --> 54:42.667
So I got into stunt
work for a while...

54:45.133 --> 54:46.633
Okay, that's enough.

54:46.633 --> 54:50.467
Let's double check your
reflexes, move over here.

54:51.733 --> 54:53.167
Okay.

54:53.167 --> 54:55.967
Now you hit him, and you
make sure you duck real fast.

54:55.967 --> 54:57.100
I gotta hit him?

54:57.100 --> 54:59.233
You duck real fast.

54:59.233 --> 55:01.667
Now you hit him, and
you duck real fast.

55:01.667 --> 55:04.367
Now you hit him, and
you duck real fast.

55:04.367 --> 55:05.300
Great.

55:05.300 --> 55:07.100
Now all together, come on.

55:07.100 --> 55:08.300
Right, left.

55:08.300 --> 55:09.533
Right, left.

55:09.533 --> 55:11.200
Right, left.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.900
Right, left.

55:12.900 --> 55:13.900
Right, left.

55:15.633 --> 55:16.633
Right, left.

55:18.167 --> 55:19.000
That's it.

55:20.667 --> 55:22.800
Okay, you passed the test.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.467
Get back in the car.

55:33.167 --> 55:34.600
Okay, you can go.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.700
Your license.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.733
(whistling)

55:57.200 --> 55:59.900
I'm gonna report you
for reckless driving,

55:59.900 --> 56:01.700
and damage to private property.

56:01.700 --> 56:03.367
Licence please.

56:03.367 --> 56:06.000
What were you thinking
about, Sergeant?

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
What possessed you to use
your patrol car as a taxi?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.667
Well it was an
emergency, Chief.

56:11.667 --> 56:13.767
I was just doing my duty.

56:14.933 --> 56:16.867
Your duty is to
catch criminals,

56:16.867 --> 56:18.433
not play Boy Scout!

56:21.233 --> 56:22.600
Look at this desk.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.600
Covered with complaints.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.433
Do you know this
city's been overtaken

56:26.433 --> 56:28.933
with a rash of tarnished green?

56:28.933 --> 56:30.033
What?

56:30.033 --> 56:31.300
Look at this.

56:32.733 --> 56:36.400
10,000 of these have been
picked up in the past week.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.633
Who picked 'em up?

56:40.633 --> 56:41.800
Who found 'em?

56:41.800 --> 56:42.867
Who lost 'em?

56:44.100 --> 56:46.767
They're counterfiet, dummy.

56:46.767 --> 56:48.900
It's no wonder the
people take them,

56:48.900 --> 56:53.033
when not even police sergeants
can tell the difference.

56:53.033 --> 56:56.533
Who questions a lousy
dollar bill, anyway?

56:58.367 --> 57:01.700
The guy who thought
this up is a genius.

57:03.067 --> 57:06.833
I want you and Officer
Speed to bring him in.

57:09.867 --> 57:12.900
Put this on, Mama
Loves Money, next race.

57:12.900 --> 57:13.900
All right.

57:13.900 --> 57:15.867
I think I just spotted Silvius.

57:15.867 --> 57:19.000
Stick to him like a
piece of honey, Paradise.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.167
Right, boss.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
[Announcer] And
there goes Speedy.

57:40.333 --> 57:41.167
Who's there?

57:41.167 --> 57:42.667
Who's the donut waving?

57:42.667 --> 57:43.900
How should I know?

57:43.900 --> 57:45.433
I don't mix with
people like that.

57:45.433 --> 57:47.100
Are you here because of Rosy?

57:47.100 --> 57:48.600
Are you kidding?

57:48.600 --> 57:51.967
On my day off, I become
a connoisseur of the dog.

57:51.967 --> 57:53.500
In order to make enough money

57:53.500 --> 57:56.267
to pay taxes so that
you can guard me.

57:56.267 --> 57:59.000
Although why I bothered
today, I don't know.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.533
Man's best friend.

58:00.533 --> 58:02.500
Well wait a minute, Sarge,
you sure you wanna do that?

58:02.500 --> 58:03.333
Why not?

58:03.333 --> 58:06.000
'Cause he's gonna win.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.533
Ha!

58:07.533 --> 58:11.000
That dog couldn't win even
if the rabbit carried him!

58:18.333 --> 58:19.167
Come on!

58:24.333 --> 58:26.833
[Announcer] He's
passing, he's moving.

58:26.833 --> 58:28.100
Look at him go!

58:30.167 --> 58:32.167
He's fifth, he's fourth!

58:36.467 --> 58:37.367
He's first!

58:39.833 --> 58:41.367
(laughing)

58:41.367 --> 58:42.367
He did it!

58:42.367 --> 58:43.300
He did it!

58:43.300 --> 58:44.867
I'm going up to get my winnings!

58:44.867 --> 58:45.700
16 to one!

58:46.967 --> 58:49.633
* Super snooper.

58:51.233 --> 58:54.133
Can I have another
please, honey.

59:01.333 --> 59:02.667
Keep the change.

59:12.767 --> 59:14.267
Silvius!

59:14.267 --> 59:16.200
I've been looking all over for
you, I have to talk to you.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.800
Sorry, I don't have time now.

59:43.633 --> 59:46.867
(dynamic action music)

59:58.933 --> 01:00:00.833
Hey fellas, are
you by any chance

01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:03.700
chasing that nice old
man in the station wagon?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.533
Who, us?

01:00:04.533 --> 01:00:05.733
Yeah, you!

01:00:05.733 --> 01:00:07.433
Oh no, we are just
out for a drive.

01:00:07.433 --> 01:00:08.267
Oh good.

01:00:08.267 --> 01:00:09.533
Well, drive carefully,

01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:12.367
'cause the lives you
save might be your own.

01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:13.433
Have a nice day!

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:14.367
Thank you.

01:00:14.367 --> 01:00:16.733
Hey, look where you're going!

01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:27.100
Hey Silvius, I've
got to talk to you.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.567
Do you have time now?

01:00:28.567 --> 01:00:30.000
Sure I have time now.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.867
What do you know
about my superpowers?

01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:33.200
Why do they come and go?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.733
You mean you don't know?

01:00:34.733 --> 01:00:36.800
No, if I did I wouldn't
need to talk to you.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.367
Well you see,
an act like yours,

01:00:38.367 --> 01:00:40.333
it sometimes only takes
one dumb little thing

01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:42.200
to destroy your concentration.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.200
A place, a person,
a color, a noise.

01:01:04.233 --> 01:01:06.500
(laughing)

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.267
You lost him?

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.933
You let a little
old man get away?

01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.367
But boss, it was that cop.

01:01:24.367 --> 01:01:25.300
What cop?

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.533
What are you talking about?

01:01:26.533 --> 01:01:27.967
It was the one
who is the friend

01:01:27.967 --> 01:01:30.633
of the friend of your friend,
I mean, Madame Labouche.

01:01:30.633 --> 01:01:32.800
The idiot means Dave Speed.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.667
He's the partner
of the chubby cop

01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:36.433
who's madly in love with me.

01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:39.033
I'm not interested
in love stories!

01:01:39.033 --> 01:01:41.300
I'm interested in an old man!

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.533
You've got to find him,

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:44.567
and I want him found,
do you understand?

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.333
Why do you always
tell me these things

01:01:47.333 --> 01:01:49.000
when I start to eat!

01:02:02.533 --> 01:02:03.367
Dave?

01:02:04.267 --> 01:02:05.267
Dave?

01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:06.700
Dave, we're here.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:11.933
Hey Dave!

01:02:14.133 --> 01:02:15.733
That's really weird.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.667
I wonder where he could be.

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.700
Well wherever
he is, he's late.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.333
Wrong, Sarge, you're late.

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:24.000
Well, you're...

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.467
Floating.

01:02:25.467 --> 01:02:29.667
Now tell me you don't
believe he has superpowers.

01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:31.900
Come down from there!

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.467
Why don't you come up here?

01:02:33.467 --> 01:02:34.300
It's fun.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.033
Are you crazy?

01:02:36.033 --> 01:02:37.500
Okay.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.533
Evelyn, did you bring
what I asked you to bring?

01:02:39.533 --> 01:02:40.700
Sure did.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.233
Get the hell
down from up there,

01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:43.400
now come down!

01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:48.467
You could have waited
'til I was ready.

01:02:48.467 --> 01:02:49.700
I'm sorry Dave.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.767
That's all right.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.700
Now put it away please.

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:56.000
Right.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.433
Ready Sarge?

01:02:57.433 --> 01:02:58.267
Watch.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:02.333
(bangs)

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.733
(laughing) See?

01:03:12.733 --> 01:03:13.733
Okay Evelyn.

01:03:13.733 --> 01:03:15.933
Please show it to me again.

01:03:15.933 --> 01:03:17.133
Wait!

01:03:17.133 --> 01:03:18.233
Now.

01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:19.067
Okay.

01:03:20.733 --> 01:03:22.733
(gasps)

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.500
Thanks.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.167
I finally found out why
my powers come and go.

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:30.300
It's the color red.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.233
Red?

01:03:31.233 --> 01:03:32.733
What are you talking about?

01:03:32.733 --> 01:03:36.000
Whenever I see red,
I lose my powers.

01:03:37.133 --> 01:03:39.133
Let me try and
explain it to you.

01:03:39.133 --> 01:03:42.733
A plutonic explosion caused
the blinding red light

01:03:42.733 --> 01:03:44.400
that gave me the superpowers.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.833
But the same color red
also takes them away

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:47.967
whenever I see it.

01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:49.467
Get it Sarge?

01:03:49.467 --> 01:03:52.967
Two forces, equal but
opposite, equal zero.

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:54.567
Remember the nuns?

01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:58.033
And, and, and when I
jumped out the window?

01:03:58.033 --> 01:03:59.500
And the stadium.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.167
Right, and the fish truck.

01:04:01.167 --> 01:04:03.133
Oh yeah, the fish truck.

01:04:03.133 --> 01:04:04.700
I sure remember that.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.900
You really made me
look like a schtook.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.400
Sarge.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.933
The inside of the
truck was all red.

01:04:10.933 --> 01:04:14.000
That's why I couldn't see
the phony bills any longer.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.467
You the trying to tell me

01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:18.100
that the money was
inside the fish?

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.167
You got it.

01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:22.067
You got it.

01:04:23.133 --> 01:04:24.367
Now, can you remember

01:04:24.367 --> 01:04:26.900
what was written on
the side of the truck?

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.400
Yeah, Torpedo Fish Company.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.167
Right, that's our man.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.867
Torpedo, get it?

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:34.567
No, I don't get it.

01:04:34.567 --> 01:04:37.967
What do you want me
to do, arrest the guy?

01:04:37.967 --> 01:04:40.600
Can you imagine what the
judge and jury would think

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.633
if you stood up
in court and say,

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:45.800
I realized those counterfeit
bills were inside the fish,

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.400
'cause I looked through
the side of the truck.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.100
Why, they'd lock you up!

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.933
But Sarge.

01:04:50.933 --> 01:04:51.767
Come on!

01:04:51.767 --> 01:04:53.100
You need positive proof,

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.700
and I know where to get it!

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.667
(sighs) Will you
quit thinking I'm nuts?

01:04:57.667 --> 01:05:00.200
Don't you realize a
man's thoughts are his own,

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.933
his own private thoughts,
so stop butting in!

01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:09.200
I've never seen him so mad.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.500
You should spend time
in the car with him.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.867
It's not all his fault.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:13.700
Why not?

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:16.467
Dave, something's not right.

01:05:16.467 --> 01:05:19.200
Evelyn, what's the matter?

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.500
Well, it's your superpowers.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.433
I mean, I don't
know if I'll ever

01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:26.167
be able to get used to them.

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:29.833
I love you, but I want
you the way you were.

01:05:30.867 --> 01:05:32.267
Come on Evelyn.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:34.733
Be positive.

01:05:34.733 --> 01:05:37.867
Look, I can wash
dishes, do the laundry,

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:42.033
make the bed, chop vegetables,
just by thinking about it.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.900
Imagine, you're going to marry

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.067
a walking, talking
domestic appliance.

01:05:47.067 --> 01:05:48.800
Batteries included.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.700
Oh, terrific.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.533
A human Cuisinart.

01:05:51.533 --> 01:05:55.567
When you wanna be serious,
you can find me at home.

01:05:55.567 --> 01:05:56.367
Freeze.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.400
Evelyn, I've got
these superpowers

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.633
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:10.067
And you know something?

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:11.267
I like them.

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.800
And I think you'll
grow to like them too.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.267
Look, I love you Evelyn,

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:19.267
and we are going to get married
whether you like it or not.

01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:35.700
All right.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.200
Now you can relax.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.800
(gasps)

01:06:42.267 --> 01:06:44.567
That same evening, I
got a list of places

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.333
where the phony
bills had turned up,

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:48.500
and set out to
find positive proof

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.167
that would point the
finger at Tony Torpedo.

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:11.333
(slick disco music)

01:07:34.367 --> 01:07:36.700
Ball in the corner pocket.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.533
Two ball in the side pocket.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.800
14 in the corner pocket.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.433
(chuckling)

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.000
14 in the corner.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.667
Hey, sir.

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:12.600
Sir?

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.000
Hey, knock it off, will you?

01:08:16.767 --> 01:08:18.233
What do you want?

01:08:18.233 --> 01:08:20.633
Sorry but, I'm looking
for the owner of this place.

01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:21.600
Well you found him.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.667
Now get lost!

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:28.533
I got five bucks
riding on this ball.

01:08:30.767 --> 01:08:33.667
Five more says
you won't make it.

01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:37.399
Make it 10 and
you've got a bet.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:38.233
10?

01:08:38.233 --> 01:08:39.399
Wait a minute.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.300
All right, you're on.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.433
Okay, it's your money,
sucker. (Chuckling)

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:03.667
(ripping)

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:05.332
Hey, I won.

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:06.500
Yeah!

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.433
(laughing)

01:09:08.433 --> 01:09:10.200
What are you laughing about?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.533
Yeah, you shouldn't laugh
at somebody else's misfortune.

01:09:13.533 --> 01:09:15.000
I know how you feel, mister.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.399
Can we settle now?

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.399
You do, huh?

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.567
Yeah, come on.

01:09:22.267 --> 01:09:23.267
Dumb luck.

01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:33.567
Here we go.

01:09:33.567 --> 01:09:35.399
One, two, three, four,

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.200
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

01:09:41.433 --> 01:09:42.633
10 on the head.

01:09:42.633 --> 01:09:44.600
10 good American bucks, kid.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.700
Enjoy yourself.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.533
Thanks.

01:09:49.466 --> 01:09:50.767
Where's the john?

01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:52.267
It's back there.

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.533
Hey, it's locked.

01:09:57.533 --> 01:09:59.100
What the hell do
you mean it's locked?

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.500
That thing is always open.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.433
You try it.

01:10:01.433 --> 01:10:03.867
Ah, wait a minute, will ya?

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.933
Hey!

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.167
Let's stop fooling around.

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:14.000
You're in bad trouble.

01:10:17.567 --> 01:10:20.000
Yeah, 10 good American bucks.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:32.033
Hey, these are really
going down the drain.

01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:33.267
You're laundering phony bills,

01:10:33.267 --> 01:10:35.667
and I want a piece
of the action, Clyde.

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:36.933
All right.

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:40.733
500 a week and I'll
stay off your back.

01:10:40.733 --> 01:10:43.767
Nothing smaller than a five.

01:10:43.767 --> 01:10:45.500
I understand.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.733
Cops are all alike.

01:10:47.733 --> 01:10:48.900
Here.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.200
You can tell Torpedo,

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.100
the time has come
to share the pie.

01:11:24.467 --> 01:11:28.467
* Tell me when will you say yes

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.533
* Tell me

01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:38.933
* Cuando, cuando, cuando

01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:45.367
* We can share a love divine

01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:54.200
* Please don't
make me wait again

01:11:58.567 --> 01:12:02.600
* When will you say yes.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.400
Well, do you want to
hear my plan or don't you?

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.100
Oh, sure.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:11.133
Phase one, convince
the underworld that
I'm a crooked cop.

01:12:11.133 --> 01:12:14.133
Phase two, catch
Torpedo in the act.

01:12:15.267 --> 01:12:16.533
Marvelous.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.333
Just marvelous.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.833
Thanks.

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:22.633
I appreciate you liking it.

01:12:22.633 --> 01:12:23.467
Like it?

01:12:23.467 --> 01:12:24.300
I love it!

01:12:28.067 --> 01:12:30.333
(clapping)

01:12:36.967 --> 01:12:39.967
(lively jazz music)

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.967
Why don't you ask
her to dance, huh?

01:12:59.967 --> 01:13:01.233
Are you crazy?

01:13:01.233 --> 01:13:02.233
We're on duty!

01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:03.167
So what?

01:13:03.167 --> 01:13:04.533
If the Chief finds out about it,

01:13:04.533 --> 01:13:06.833
then tell him you were
questioning a witness.

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:09.433
Dancing on duty is a violation

01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:11.600
of police code 42 slash B.

01:13:12.767 --> 01:13:15.900
Oh Sarge, you are a
credit to the force.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:19.067
Besides, I don't
know how to dance.

01:13:19.067 --> 01:13:20.733
Sarge, look at me.

01:13:23.067 --> 01:13:26.400
You're going to dance
like Fred Astaire.

01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:29.033
Like Fred Astaire.

01:13:33.533 --> 01:13:36.800
I'm going to dance
like Fred Astaire.

01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:46.467
(clapping)

01:13:47.933 --> 01:13:51.867
Now here's someone who
really wants to dance.

01:13:54.367 --> 01:13:56.400
Shall we dance, Sergeant?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.600
I'd love to.

01:14:11.233 --> 01:14:13.567
Ah, you dance divinely.

01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:16.733
I'm just trying
to keep up with you.

01:14:17.867 --> 01:14:19.133
Oh I know, you've
come to tell me

01:14:19.133 --> 01:14:20.400
that your boss wants to see me

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.000
and I'm to follow
you to his office.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.667
I come to tell you that
the boss wants to see you.

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:27.900
And that you have to
follow me to his office.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.833
Hey wait a moment.

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:30.700
Didn't you just tell me that?

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.200
Did I?

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.267
Oh, let's go.

01:14:38.067 --> 01:14:39.467
Hey man.

01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:41.967
How come you always throw 12?

01:14:41.967 --> 01:14:44.233
Because Torpedo's men
are impossible to beat.

01:14:44.233 --> 01:14:45.633
Throw me another.

01:14:47.533 --> 01:14:50.333
Hey, that's hard to beat.

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:52.667
It's impossible to beat.

01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:53.800
No kidding.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800
May I try?

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.933
Be my guest.

01:14:56.933 --> 01:14:58.833
Let's roll 'em again.

01:15:00.067 --> 01:15:01.467
Eenie meenie minie mo.

01:15:01.467 --> 01:15:03.133
Catch a tiger by his toe.

01:15:03.133 --> 01:15:05.300
If he hollers, let him go.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.100
Now that's hard to beat.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.567
Take the money and run.

01:15:12.567 --> 01:15:14.133
Come on.

01:15:14.133 --> 01:15:15.133
Thank you.

01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:21.100
You see, he has
these superpowers.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.067
He can do anything he wants,

01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:26.200
and make other
people do the same.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.733
You make him sound like
something out of a comic strip.

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:31.267
Oh no no.

01:15:31.267 --> 01:15:32.900
Oh no.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.700
He's just as human as we are.

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:36.700
Oh?

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.133
The only thing is that,

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:40.067
every time he sees red,

01:15:42.933 --> 01:15:45.033
he loses his superpowers.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.167
Oh, really?

01:15:53.867 --> 01:15:57.467
So you're police
officer Davey Speed, huh?

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.433
You've been making a lot
of noise around town.

01:16:04.433 --> 01:16:08.000
I think it's about time
you and I sat down.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:13.333
* Super snooper

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:17.667
* Super super super.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.133
You lousy
flat-footed smartass.

01:16:21.133 --> 01:16:22.900
Ain't fooling me!

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.267
I know you're pretending
to be a corrupt cop

01:16:25.267 --> 01:16:26.800
because you hope I'll admit

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.867
to putting out a
contract on old Silvius.

01:16:29.867 --> 01:16:32.967
Sure I had that no
good bum killed.

01:16:32.967 --> 01:16:35.067
But you think I'm
gonna tell you?

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:36.300
No.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.900
Forget it, I ain't
got rocks in my head,

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.000
and there's no way I'm
ever gonna tell you

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.433
where I print those
phony one-doller bills

01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:44.333
my men pass out on the streets.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.267
Boss!

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.533
And you'll never find out

01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:48.500
that the press is set
up in my fishing boat,

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.733
the Barracuda, which is
anchored in the Gulf!

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:53.367
You know why?

01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:54.867
Why?

01:16:54.867 --> 01:16:59.033
Because there's no
cop smarter than I am.

01:16:59.033 --> 01:17:01.300
(laughing)

01:17:04.767 --> 01:17:06.300
Hey flat foot.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.833
I bet you can't guess how we
transport those phony bills

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:12.500
from the boat to the drop zones.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.900
Well, let me see.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.600
Sewn into the fish.

01:17:21.033 --> 01:17:24.800
Sewn into the bellies of the
fish your boat catches, right?

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.933
Thank you, Mr. Torpedo,
that's all I wanted to know.

01:17:37.667 --> 01:17:38.667
Hey look!

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:41.000
There she is, the Barracuda.

01:17:44.533 --> 01:17:45.933
Looks deserted.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:48.033
Don't be too sure.

01:17:48.033 --> 01:17:50.533
I wish you could fly this thing

01:17:50.533 --> 01:17:52.967
so I could go down
and take a look.

01:17:52.967 --> 01:17:54.567
Well I'll go down.

01:17:54.567 --> 01:17:55.867
You?

01:17:55.867 --> 01:17:57.967
I don't think that's
a good idea, Sarge.

01:17:57.967 --> 01:17:59.167
Why not?

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:00.600
What's the matter,
you think I'm too old?

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.733
Come on, get us over
that old bathtub

01:18:02.733 --> 01:18:04.067
over there, I'll show ya.

01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:05.667
Anything you say.

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:18.700
All right?

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.533
Okay.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.100
Now listen you.

01:18:27.367 --> 01:18:29.367
You take care of Evelyn.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.733
I used to get more
when I was a stuntman.

01:19:27.733 --> 01:19:30.800
I'm gonna go down below
and take a look, okay?

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.967
Okay Sarge, go down in
the hole of it, anywhere.

01:19:45.567 --> 01:19:46.933
[Dunlop] Hey
Dave, you read me?

01:19:46.933 --> 01:19:47.933
Loud and clear.

01:19:47.933 --> 01:19:49.400
What's happening down there?

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.200
[Dunlop] Think Torpedo's
been pulling your leg.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.833
There's not a soul on board.

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.867
No printing press, nothing!

01:19:54.867 --> 01:19:57.433
Search again,
it's gotta be there.

01:19:57.433 --> 01:19:58.267
Okay.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.633
But I tell you there's
nothing down here.

01:20:26.033 --> 01:20:28.367
(chuckling)

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.433
Aha.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.000
Dave, listen Dave, I found it!

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:50.833
I found it!

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:51.667
You hear me, Dave?

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:52.633
I found it.

01:20:52.633 --> 01:20:53.633
It's a counterfeiter's dream.

01:20:53.633 --> 01:20:55.633
Phony bills, plates, press.

01:20:55.633 --> 01:20:57.767
(giggling)

01:20:57.767 --> 01:21:01.433
We got enough evidence here
to put Torpedo away for life,

01:21:01.433 --> 01:21:02.667
I'm telling you!

01:21:02.667 --> 01:21:04.800
Now go back to town
and get some help.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.600
I'll be waiting for you, baby!

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.167
Okay Sarge, I'll be
back before you know it.

01:21:09.167 --> 01:21:10.000
Bye.

01:21:37.733 --> 01:21:38.667
Hurry up!

01:21:40.867 --> 01:21:41.900
Come on, come on!

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:42.867
Hello, hello?

01:21:42.867 --> 01:21:44.333
We're sinking the Barracuda.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.867
We caught one of the
cops sneaking around.

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.800
We're gonna leave him on board
so he goes down with her.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.267
Over and out.

01:21:49.267 --> 01:21:50.267
Let's move!

01:21:50.267 --> 01:21:51.800
Move it, move it!

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.633
We don't have a lot of time
before the boat goes down.

01:21:55.633 --> 01:21:57.867
Everybody, off of the boat!

01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:02.000
(groaning)

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.100
Hey!

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.767
(knocking) Hey!

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.500
Officer Speed, what
have you done with him?

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.733
Done with who, Chief?

01:23:26.733 --> 01:23:28.167
[Chief] Sergeant Dunlop.

01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:29.100
Oh, Sarge.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.633
He's on the Barracuda.

01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:32.600
I told you so over the radio.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.633
That's where Tony Torpedo's
been printing the phony bills.

01:23:35.633 --> 01:23:37.000
Why don't you ask her?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.300
She can tell you a
lot more than I can.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.900
Chief, I've told
you everything I know.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.433
Last night at the
Mocambo I overheard

01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:48.300
that man try to extort
protection money
from Mr. Torpedo.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.900
He's a corrupt cop, and
Sergeant Dunlop found out.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.067
That's why he had to kill him.

01:23:54.067 --> 01:23:57.367
After all Chief, he couldn't
afford to let him talk.

01:23:57.367 --> 01:23:58.500
That ridiculous!

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.000
She's lying.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.433
Why don't you send a patrol
out to check on the Barracuda?

01:24:02.433 --> 01:24:04.733
You'll find Sarge there
sitting on the evidence.

01:24:04.733 --> 01:24:07.800
We just ad a report from
the Coast Guard, Chief.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.033
There's no boat within
a 50-mile radius

01:24:10.033 --> 01:24:14.033
of the coordinates given
to us by Officer Speed.

01:24:15.567 --> 01:24:18.967
You're under arrest for
the first-degree murder

01:24:18.967 --> 01:24:21.867
of police sergeants
William Dunlop.

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:26.367
There's nothing worse
than a corrupt cop, Speed.

01:24:26.367 --> 01:24:28.867
Take him away and lock him up.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.333
[Speed] And that, my friends,

01:24:38.333 --> 01:24:40.300
is how I ended up on Death Row.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.833
Rosy Labouche made sure I
couldn't use my superpowers,

01:24:43.833 --> 01:24:46.067
and she always arranged
to have something red

01:24:46.067 --> 01:24:48.667
clearly visible any
place I was taken.

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.533
The only thing that
saved me so far

01:24:50.533 --> 01:24:53.333
is that they haven't
allowed Rosy to be present

01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:56.200
each time they
tried to execute me.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.533
Warden.

01:25:13.533 --> 01:25:15.333
Where did the flowers come from?

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:17.767
Well they're from Rosy
Labouche, the film star.

01:25:17.767 --> 01:25:19.333
I'll read the card.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:22.933
Today.

01:25:24.367 --> 01:25:28.833
May the red of these flowers
bring the warmth you deserve.

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:30.333
Rosy.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:33.400
You must be very proud to have
a friend like Rosy Labouche.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.833
May I keep this as a souvenir?

01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:36.667
Oh sure.

01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:37.900
Thank you.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.133
I'm allowed on
last wish, right?

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.300
Oh, of course.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.533
I'd like, um, bubble gum.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.500
Bubble gum.

01:25:47.633 --> 01:25:49.867
Could you please
put it in my pocket?

01:25:49.867 --> 01:25:51.467
I'll have it later.

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:56.567
Thanks.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.633
Father?

01:26:00.767 --> 01:26:02.433
I want you to have
those flowers,

01:26:02.433 --> 01:26:04.833
for the altar in your church.

01:26:29.467 --> 01:26:31.633
(buzzing)

01:26:42.667 --> 01:26:44.933
(shouting)

01:26:59.867 --> 01:27:01.600
We should check
out all sea traffic

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.833
within 50 miles of
the shore, ten fore.

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:22.200
(sirens blaring)

01:29:11.533 --> 01:29:12.367
Jesus!

01:29:12.367 --> 01:29:13.933
* He's a super snooper

01:29:13.933 --> 01:29:16.000
* Really super trooper

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.033
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw

01:29:19.033 --> 01:29:20.767
* He's a super snooper

01:29:20.767 --> 01:29:22.500
* Really super trooper.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.700
Come on you old bear.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.800
Your hibernation is over.

01:29:27.867 --> 01:29:30.133
(groaning)

01:29:43.733 --> 01:29:45.500
* He's a super snooper

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.833
* Really super trooper

01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:52.000
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.900
Well you finally showed up.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.433
Where the hell have you been?

01:29:57.433 --> 01:29:59.600
Well, it's a long story.

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.700
What the hell is this?

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.300
It smells like...

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.000
Hell, it tastes
like chewing gum!

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.833
Whatever you say Sarge,
you're always right.

01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:26.700
(screaming)

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.067
Take it easy Sarge.

01:30:28.067 --> 01:30:31.767
Just stay in the same
place, you'll be fine!

01:30:31.767 --> 01:30:32.967
We're flying!

01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:33.800
Relax!

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.733
Now listen, there's a
lot I have to tell you,

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:40.367
after I left you
on the Barracuda.

01:30:40.367 --> 01:30:44.533
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw.

01:30:46.433 --> 01:30:47.333
Rosy?

01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:49.233
What's the hurry?

01:30:49.233 --> 01:30:50.867
What's the rush?

01:30:50.867 --> 01:30:53.300
Both the cops are dead.

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:54.500
Dunlop is.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.633
But I'm not so sure about Speed.

01:30:56.633 --> 01:30:58.800
He's gonna show up
sooner or later,

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.967
and I don't wanna be
around when he does.

01:31:00.967 --> 01:31:02.667
Don't wanna be around, huh?

01:31:02.667 --> 01:31:04.767
Well, where are we going?

01:31:04.767 --> 01:31:07.167
Somewhere where
a millionairess

01:31:07.167 --> 01:31:09.900
can live in style and peace.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:10.733
Cuba.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.767
Cuba?

01:31:13.767 --> 01:31:15.000
Cuba, huh?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.333
You know, I can't even
speak the language!

01:31:18.333 --> 01:31:20.267
That's why we're going.

01:31:20.267 --> 01:31:21.767
We bring you this
special news report

01:31:21.767 --> 01:31:24.233
following up on our leads about
the jailbreak of Dave Speed.

01:31:24.233 --> 01:31:27.733
Earlier today, a large
balloon erupted from the sea

01:31:27.733 --> 01:31:30.633
heading towards outer space
with two men attached.

01:31:30.633 --> 01:31:32.233
Mr. Belushi here was
fishing out of the Gulf

01:31:32.233 --> 01:31:33.233
and saw the event.

01:31:33.233 --> 01:31:35.600
Are these the two men?

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.433
Yes, yes!

01:31:36.433 --> 01:31:37.633
Those are the two men!

01:31:37.633 --> 01:31:38.467
Those are?

01:31:38.467 --> 01:31:40.000
Yes, yes!

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.467
Ladies and gentlemen,
the two men he pointed out

01:31:41.467 --> 01:31:43.767
are Dave Speed and the
late Sergeant Willy Dunlop.

01:31:43.767 --> 01:31:45.333
We'll be back with
further developments

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:49.500
on this most unusual event
as soon as they happen.

01:31:51.033 --> 01:31:52.033
Understand now, Sarge?

01:31:52.033 --> 01:31:53.000
Yeah!

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.467
Now will you please get me down?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Will you let go!

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.867
What do you want from me?

01:31:59.867 --> 01:32:02.300
You're gonna be our
passport out of here, baby.

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.800
With you as hostage,

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.500
Speed wouldn't dare try any
of his superpower tricks.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.700
Did you get the plane?

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.000
Oh yes, Madame.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.533
We had to get rid of the pilot.

01:32:10.533 --> 01:32:13.433
You had to get
rid of the pilot!

01:32:13.433 --> 01:32:14.267
Yeah.

01:32:14.267 --> 01:32:16.133
Who's gonna fly it?

01:32:16.133 --> 01:32:16.967
Who?

01:32:16.967 --> 01:32:17.800
I am.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.633
Who?

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:19.467
I am!

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:20.967
Come on, let's go!

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.167
Hey boss.

01:32:23.167 --> 01:32:24.833
Over my dead body!

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.267
Hey boss, take
a look over there.

01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:29.267
There, look!

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.933
[Torpedo] So it's a balloon!

01:32:31.933 --> 01:32:35.500
Come on, you're
wasting time, let's go!

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.433
Hey look!

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.733
Rosy and Torpedo are
making a getaway.

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:52.867
They've got Evelyn!

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:54.600
They've got Evelyn?

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:09.667
We gotta stop 'em!

01:33:16.167 --> 01:33:18.267
You'll never get away with
this, they'll catch you!

01:33:18.267 --> 01:33:19.767
Eh, shut up.

01:33:19.767 --> 01:33:22.100
They'll put you in jail
and throw the key away!

01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:22.933
Shut up!

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.300
You stay here
Sarge, I'll stop them.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.500
Stay here, where you going?

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.067
To catch a plane!

01:33:35.233 --> 01:33:37.133
Whoa, what's happening?

01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:39.900
Relax, it's just
an air pocket.

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.900
Oh, oh!

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.733
Dave!

01:33:53.733 --> 01:33:55.867
* He's a super snooper

01:33:55.867 --> 01:33:58.033
* Really super trooper

01:33:58.033 --> 01:34:01.000
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.133
Calling all cars,
calling all cars.

01:34:03.133 --> 01:34:04.633
This is Officer Dave Speed.

01:34:04.633 --> 01:34:06.100
Sergeant Dunlop's alive.

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.467
We're putting an
end to the gang.

01:34:08.467 --> 01:34:12.300
Arriving at sea plane
base any minute.

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.133
Hey Chief.

01:34:14.533 --> 01:34:17.767
If this operation is a success,
we'll re-elect the governor.

01:34:17.767 --> 01:34:18.600
Over.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.400
* He's a super snooper

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.600
* Really super trooper

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.900
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.667
* He's a super snooper

01:34:34.667 --> 01:34:37.933
* Really super trooper.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.800
I can't, I can't control her.

01:35:00.533 --> 01:35:02.867
(screaming)

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:15.533
* Super

01:35:15.533 --> 01:35:18.533
* Super super super

01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:21.033
* He's a super snooper

01:35:21.033 --> 01:35:22.733
* Really super trooper

01:35:22.733 --> 01:35:25.867
* A wonder cop a one
like you never saw

01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:27.700
* He's a super snooper

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.867
* Really super trooper.

01:35:29.867 --> 01:35:31.500
You've stopped the aircraft!

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.767
Why?

01:35:32.767 --> 01:35:33.700
Oh what do mean, what
am I stopping here for,

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.900
the controls are out, dummy!

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.267
* He's a super snooper

01:35:38.267 --> 01:35:41.533
* Really super trooper

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.433
* He's a super snooper

01:35:45.433 --> 01:35:47.500
* Really super trooper

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:51.667
* A wonder cop a roller
the side of the law

01:35:59.033 --> 01:36:01.800
(sirens blaring)

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.300
All right, everybody
out of the plane!

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.667
Get out of there!

01:36:18.667 --> 01:36:19.933
Keep your hands up!

01:36:19.933 --> 01:36:21.800
Am I glad to see you guys!

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.567
Am I glad, hey,
what are you doing?

01:36:24.567 --> 01:36:25.400
David!

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.667
Evelyn!

01:36:26.667 --> 01:36:27.967
Oh David.

01:36:27.967 --> 01:36:29.467
Oh, I was so scared.

01:36:29.467 --> 01:36:30.700
Oh, Evelyn.

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.233
Sorry I put you
through all that.

01:36:33.233 --> 01:36:34.600
Well how did you do it?

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.000
You know, my superpowers.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.933
My greatest role.

01:36:37.933 --> 01:36:39.167
What an ending.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:44.833
Officer Speed.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.267
Congratulations.

01:36:47.267 --> 01:36:48.500
Thank you Chief.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.067
Boy, that was a
fine piece of work.

01:36:50.067 --> 01:36:52.600
I knew you were innocent
right from the beginning.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.100
Of course you did, Chief.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.767
I always knew that
Rosy Labouche and Torpedo

01:36:56.767 --> 01:36:58.267
were the real culprits.

01:36:58.267 --> 01:37:01.533
You said that Sergeant
Dunlop is alive.

01:37:02.667 --> 01:37:03.667
Where is he?

01:37:06.933 --> 01:37:08.200
On the balloon?

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.067
Dave!

01:37:12.067 --> 01:37:14.700
(laughing)

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.200
Hey, you're not
the only one baby,

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.567
look at me!

01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:19.400
Shh!

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.900
This is the Sarge!

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:27.667
I'm sitting on top of
the world, don't you dare.

01:37:29.067 --> 01:37:30.900
Dave, I'm coming down.

01:37:32.033 --> 01:37:35.567
You gotta get me baby,
you gotta get me.

01:37:35.567 --> 01:37:36.733
Come on!

01:37:36.733 --> 01:37:37.567
No!

01:37:41.167 --> 01:37:42.467
[Evelyn] David, look out,

01:37:42.467 --> 01:37:44.633
you have something
red around your leg!

01:37:44.633 --> 01:37:45.700
Here we go!

01:38:04.667 --> 01:38:06.333
Dave, Uncle Willy!

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.767
We can all be proud
of Officer Dave Speed.

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:21.267
He died in a
valiant, vain attempt

01:38:21.267 --> 01:38:23.567
to save the life of his friend

01:38:23.567 --> 01:38:27.300
and superior officer,
Sergeant William Dunlop.

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:29.933
We'll remember them
with honor and pride.

01:38:29.933 --> 01:38:31.700
Excuse me Chief,
there's a call for you.

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:32.933
This is hardly the moment.

01:38:32.933 --> 01:38:35.333
Have you no respect
for the valiant dead?

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:37.400
I really think you
should take this call, sir.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.300
It's uh, long distance.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.200
Ah, fine.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.233
What?

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.433
What?

01:38:44.433 --> 01:38:45.267
Who?

01:38:46.433 --> 01:38:49.733
Is this some kind
of a sick joke?

01:38:49.733 --> 01:38:52.300
(gong ringing)

01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.900
That's right Chief!

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.600
That's right, we're fine!

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, we're okay!

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.700
Yeah, what?

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.633
Where are we calling from?

01:39:09.633 --> 01:39:11.433
Um, just a minute.

01:39:11.433 --> 01:39:13.600
Where are we calling from?

01:39:14.733 --> 01:39:18.667
(speaking in foreign language)

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.000
That's right.

01:39:26.033 --> 01:39:27.700
Dave, Uncle Willy?

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.167
