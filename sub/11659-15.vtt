(mellow music playing)

00:56.266 --> 00:58.567
Hi, Sophia. What are you cooking?

00:58.633 --> 01:02.533
-Lasagna. For a guy at the center.
-Oh, is he cute?

01:02.600 --> 01:05.800
Cute? He's 84, without
a hair on his head,

01:05.867 --> 01:09.233
or a tooth in his mouth,
and his body's covered with liver spots.

01:10.266 --> 01:12.400
To answer your question,
he's adorable.

01:14.367 --> 01:17.967
Look at the great costume I got
for the masquerade ball.

01:18.533 --> 01:21.400
I can't decide whether to be the front end
or the rear end.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.200
I'm in a romantic mood.

01:25.467 --> 01:28.066
I'm going to let that golden opportunity
pass right by.

01:28.967 --> 01:30.667
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Oh, hello.

01:30.734 --> 01:33.900
I got our costume
for the masquerade ball.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.000
Is it time for that again?

01:36.066 --> 01:39.667
-It's the season's biggest social event.
-Dorothy, it'll be fun.

01:39.734 --> 01:43.166
It won't. There's no fun in my life.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.567
Ever felt like you're stuck,
going through the motions

01:46.633 --> 01:49.667
with no joy, pleasure, or excitement?

01:49.734 --> 01:52.066
That was my sex life with your father.

01:54.633 --> 01:59.033
Ma, my job is routine. I have virtually
no social life, and nothing interests me.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.333
My life's become dull and boring.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.367
Where's that sense of fun,
that lighthearted laughter,

02:05.433 --> 02:07.066
that devil-may-care attitude?

02:07.133 --> 02:09.567
When was Dorothy like that?

02:09.633 --> 02:12.567
Never. I've asked her these questions
since she was 12.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.934
Dorothy, you can't
help it if you're dull and boring.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.734
God did that to give the world
some variety.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.233
Otherwise,
everybody would be just like me.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.467
And there wouldn't be
enough sailors to go around.

02:28.166 --> 02:32.967
Your life doesn't have to be dull.
It's up to you to make it interesting.

02:33.033 --> 02:37.200
-Oh, I know. You're right.
-So do something.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.000
There's a lecture at the school tonight.
Barbara Thorndyke's going to speak.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.667
-Maybe I'll go there.
-Who's Barbara Thorndyke?

02:44.734 --> 02:48.033
A local novelist
whose stories are set in Florida.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.700
Wait. Barbara Thorndyke.

02:50.767 --> 02:53.633
-She wrote <i>Evil Wind Over Pensacola?</i>
-Oh, you know it?

02:53.700 --> 02:56.467
-I go to bed with it every night.
-What's it about?

02:56.533 --> 02:59.834
Who knows?
My mattress frame lost a caster.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.367
I use it to keep the bed level.

03:03.333 --> 03:09.500
(serene music playing)

03:13.967 --> 03:15.934
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Hi, Blanche.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.934
-Are we expecting company?
-Yup, Barbara Thorndyke.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.834
I introduced myself after the lecture.
We had coffee and talked for hours.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.200
What about?

03:25.266 --> 03:28.500
Oh, art, literature, world events, life.

03:28.567 --> 03:32.200
I haven't had that stimulating
a conversation in years.

03:32.266 --> 03:36.734
If you're saying you can't get that around
here, I beg to differ.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
I can't believe it.

03:37.867 --> 03:41.533
It says that since Michael Jackson
can't buy the elephant man,

03:41.600 --> 03:44.800
he's bidding for the big bopper's remains.

03:48.066 --> 03:51.133
Don't believe anything in that rag.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.700
It caters to people
of the lowest intelligence.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.300
Then why do you buy it?

03:57.400 --> 04:01.767
Because it's the only newspaper
Elvis will talk to from beyond the grave.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.433
-I'm sorry, Dorothy. Where was I?
-Uh, it's not important.

04:07.500 --> 04:11.000
Let's put this away so Barbara Thorndyke
won't see it.

04:11.266 --> 04:13.233
Barbara Thorndyke's coming here?

04:13.300 --> 04:17.100
-I've never met a real author before.
-I have.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.500
I once stood in line
two hours at a bookstore

04:19.567 --> 04:21.767
for Arnold Schwarzenegger's autograph.

04:22.367 --> 04:25.600
When I think of great literary figures
of our time,

04:25.667 --> 04:28.667
it's usually Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and...

04:28.734 --> 04:30.500
-Schwarzenegger.
-Schwarzenegger.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.900
-Did he sign your book?
-Yes!

04:33.967 --> 04:36.500
But only after he refused
to sign my thigh.

04:38.467 --> 04:42.433
He was probably intimidated
to see a thigh bigger than his.

04:48.233 --> 04:51.433
-Hi, Ma.
-Anybody want a lasagna?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.734
I thought you made that
for your gentleman friend.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.100
He didn't want it. He said he ate.
I offered to warm it at his place.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.567
-He said no.
-Sophia, honey,

05:01.633 --> 05:04.900
the key is to make him
think you're not interested.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.667
Offering to cook
made you look too easy.

05:07.734 --> 05:11.233
Black underwear and pasties couldn't
make me look easy.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.266
(doorbell chimes)

05:19.000 --> 05:21.533
Oh, Barbara, please come in. Come in.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.333
These are my friends,
Blanche Devereaux, Rose Nylund.

05:26.867 --> 05:27.967
Sit down, sit down.

05:28.033 --> 05:31.433
Barbara, Dorothy tells
us you're an author.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.467
I'm just a writer. Malamud's an author.

05:35.734 --> 05:39.400
I thought malamuds were chocolate cookies
with marshmallow in the middle.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.500
Those are malamars, Rose.

05:52.633 --> 05:56.033
I want you to have a copy
of my latest novel.

05:56.633 --> 05:59.166
<i>Scarlet Dawn at Boca Raton.</i>

06:00.066 --> 06:01.500
Read the inscription.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.233
"To Dorothy Zbornak,
a new and fascinating friend."

06:06.300 --> 06:09.700
Oh, thank you so much. I'm really touched.

06:09.767 --> 06:14.233
I'll get the coffee
and let you three get acquainted.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.867
That's such a stunning brooch.
Wherever did you get it?

06:17.934 --> 06:23.667
I was in Morocco working on a novel,
not to mention a dashing Moroccan...

06:24.867 --> 06:27.200
when I had an attack of writer's block.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.734
I was devoid of all ideas and thoughts.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.667
That happens to me a lot.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.333
-Do you write?
-No.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.133
Why do you ask?

06:48.900 --> 06:50.000
Go on, Barbara.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.800
I went for a walk
in a crowded marketplace.

06:54.867 --> 06:58.000
A man came up behind me,
put something in my hand,

06:58.066 --> 07:00.633
and said, "This is what you need."

07:00.700 --> 07:03.867
That happened to me once in
the produce section at the A&amp;P.

07:06.834 --> 07:10.567
Well, anyway,
the man gave me the brooch...

07:10.967 --> 07:13.567
and since then I've never had
any problem writing.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.533
This is my muse,
my artistic inspiration...

07:16.934 --> 07:18.900
the embodiment of my creativity.

07:18.967 --> 07:22.033
And you know what's even better,
it goes with anything.

07:23.567 --> 07:27.600
It might be a little tricky with plaid.
I'd be very careful if I were you.

07:28.567 --> 07:30.400
I think you've missed
the point of my story.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.734
Oh, really? Run it by us again.

07:34.633 --> 07:35.633
I think not.

07:38.233 --> 07:41.133
So... do you bowl?

07:43.266 --> 07:44.433
I beg your pardon?

07:46.734 --> 07:47.734
How's it going?

07:47.800 --> 07:52.000
I've had the most delightful conversation
with Rose and Madge.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.667
-That's Blanche.
-Oh, of course.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.433
I remembered a previous engagement.
I really have to go.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.300
Aw, that's too bad.
At least let me walk you to your car.

08:07.433 --> 08:08.800
-(door closes)
-What do you think?

08:08.867 --> 08:11.867
-There's something about her I don't like.
-Me, too.

08:11.934 --> 08:14.667
-I find her hard to talk to.
-Me, too.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.033
-She thinks I'm dumb.
-Me, too.

08:19.967 --> 08:24.133
(mellow music playing)

08:33.700 --> 08:36.734
Hi, Blanche. Have you decided
who you'll be at the ball?

08:36.800 --> 08:39.233
Yes, I'm going as eve,
from the garden of Eden.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.834
All I'll need is a few
strategically-placed leaves.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.867
What about a snake?

08:43.934 --> 08:46.233
Oh, I already have a snake.
I'm going with Hank Quinlan.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.767
He's a whiplash attorney.

08:51.133 --> 08:54.333
Hi, Dorothy.
Want to see a movie with us?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.967
Oh, I can't tonight.

08:56.033 --> 08:59.233
Barbara's taking me
to the experimental theater downtown.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.266
Somebody dragged me to a show there.

09:02.633 --> 09:05.734
Three men paraded around the stage
for five hours,

09:05.800 --> 09:08.166
talking about God and eating crackers.

09:08.533 --> 09:12.367
Other than masks covering their faces,
they were totally naked.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.500
You stayed the whole evening?

09:14.567 --> 09:18.834
I would have left, but one of the actors
looked so familiar to me...

09:24.066 --> 09:26.967
but it was hard to tell
since he had such a small part.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.567
Dorothy, why don't you come with us?
You'll have more fun.

09:36.633 --> 09:40.433
-Besides, Barbara's so snooty.
-How can you say that?

09:40.500 --> 09:44.633
-You hardly know her.
-Why doesn't she include us?

09:44.700 --> 09:47.333
Because you have different interests.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.734
Is it too much to ask my best friends
to respect my right

09:50.800 --> 09:55.000
-to have different interests in life?
-I guess not.

09:55.066 --> 09:56.233
Thank you.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.400
I promise we'll do something together
real soon, okay?

10:03.433 --> 10:06.867
We didn't give Barbara
much of a chance.

10:06.934 --> 10:09.800
-First impressions can be wrong.
-You're right.

10:10.834 --> 10:13.266
I remember when
I was a little girl back in St. Olaf.

10:17.133 --> 10:21.600
This old lady lived up the street.
She never smiled.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.834
She always looked angry.

10:23.900 --> 10:27.500
The kids said she'd kill anyone
on her property.

10:27.567 --> 10:31.900
-We called her mean old lady Hickenlooper.
-Kids can be pretty cruel.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.734
That was her name,
Mean Old Lady Hickenlooper.

10:35.433 --> 10:38.433
She had it changed legally
'cause everybody called her that anyway.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.667
Then how come
your name isn't big dummy?

10:44.500 --> 10:47.467
There were already
three other people with that name.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.567
But that's beside the point.

10:50.633 --> 10:54.967
One day, I got up the courage
to go up to Mean Old Lady Hickenlooper

10:55.033 --> 10:57.700
and ask her why she always frowned.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.433
Well, she had been born
with no smiling muscles.

11:04.433 --> 11:09.266
I pointed out that a frown is just a smile
turned upside-down.

11:09.867 --> 11:15.333
So from then on, whenever I'd go by,
she'd stand on her head and wave.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.433
That is one of the stupidest stories
I've ever heard...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.667
which proves my first impression
of you was right.

11:34.633 --> 11:36.300
Blanche, I have an idea.

11:37.066 --> 11:41.000
Let's invite Barbara Thorndyke for dinner
and give her another chance.

11:41.066 --> 11:44.500
Sure, if it makes Dorothy happy.
Let's go to the movies.

11:46.266 --> 11:48.433
Rose, what was your
first impression of me?

11:49.900 --> 11:52.600
I thought you wore too much makeup
and were a slut.

11:59.166 --> 12:02.100
But I was wrong.
You don't wear too much makeup.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.867
(serene music playing)

12:11.734 --> 12:15.433
And so Dorothy Parker turned to
Alexander Woollcott,

12:15.500 --> 12:18.967
and said, "If you laid all the women
in this room, end to end...

12:19.333 --> 12:20.834
I wouldn't be a bit surprised."

12:23.500 --> 12:25.100
That's very clever.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.567
Very, very clever.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.100
I can't remember
hearing anything more clever...

12:31.500 --> 12:34.533
unless it was last week on <i>Alf</i>
when the cat next door--

12:36.300 --> 12:38.233
I'll go get the after-dinner drinks.

12:38.734 --> 12:41.800
I picked up your first novel
the other day.

12:41.867 --> 12:45.400
Ah.
<i>So dark the waves on Biscayne Bay.</i>

12:45.700 --> 12:49.533
-I've grown as a writer since then.
-I should hope so.

12:51.700 --> 12:56.333
-Blanche...
-Did you've a problem with my book, dear?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.533
As a matter of fact, I did.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.066
All those waves.

13:00.133 --> 13:04.633
Big waves, little waves,
dark waves rolling in, page after page.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.600
I had to take a Dramamine
to get through chapter three.

13:10.567 --> 13:14.233
Blanche, the waves are a metaphor.
You see, a metaphor--

13:14.300 --> 13:17.767
I know what a metaphor is, dear.
I'm not a dummy.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.600
Blanche, what's a metaphor?

13:23.533 --> 13:26.033
It's when you use a phrase to mean
something else.

13:26.100 --> 13:31.200
When I say men are blinded by my beauty,
they're not really blinded.

13:31.266 --> 13:33.433
Their sight returns in a day or two.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.967
Barbara, this is my mother Sophia.

13:39.633 --> 13:44.300
Sophia, your daughter is one of the most
beautiful people I've ever met.

13:44.367 --> 13:47.133
Boy, you writers never stop using
your imagination.

13:50.166 --> 13:52.200
-(horn honks)
-Well, goodbye.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.266
Where are you going?

13:57.333 --> 14:02.533
It's Saturday night. I'm all dressed up.
A car's honking. Think, Dorothy.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.100
Remember something called a date?

14:06.667 --> 14:09.433
Well, I think I better be going, too.

14:09.734 --> 14:11.233
But it's still early.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.100
We could have a game of oogle and floogle.

14:15.934 --> 14:20.100
-I don't believe I've ever heard of that.
-We played it in St. Olaf.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.934
It's an adult version of hide-and-go-seek.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.700
How does it differ
from the children's version?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.000
Adults play it.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.200
Of course. I should've known.

14:35.033 --> 14:36.700
I think I'll take a rain check.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.800
You were nice to come.

14:39.867 --> 14:43.266
I've a ticket for the writers'
symposium Friday.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.333
-Would you like to come?
-I'd love to. Thank you.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.000
-Anything for friends. <i>Ciao.</i>
<i>-Ciao.</i>

14:50.633 --> 14:52.066
And goodbye
to you, too.

14:52.133 --> 14:55.900
The masquerade ball is Friday.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.633
You know how much it means to me.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.567
I'm counting on you
to be the rear end of my horse.

15:02.567 --> 15:07.500
Rose... sweetheart...
this Friday, I can choose

15:07.567 --> 15:11.166
between rubbing elbows with Norman Mailer

15:11.233 --> 15:14.166
or doing the hokey-pokey
in a horse costume...

15:14.567 --> 15:16.967
with your behind in my face.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.667
Well, which is it going to be?

15:25.667 --> 15:30.433
(calm music playing)

15:40.533 --> 15:43.967
-Rose, pass the Tuffy.
-With pleasure, Blanche.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.834
-Thank you, Rose.
-You're welcome, Blanche.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.633
-You can always count on me.
-That's why I always ask you.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.133
I saw Jack and Janet
give Chrissy this treatment

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
on an episode of <i>Three's Company.</i>

15:57.667 --> 16:02.066
Oh, a reference from Dorothy
that even we illiterates can understand.

16:02.633 --> 16:05.400
I guess her well of knowledge has run dry.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.266
That's a metaphor, Dorothy.

16:12.367 --> 16:16.133
Why is it so important
that I go to this ball?

16:16.200 --> 16:18.133
Because it's important to Rose.

16:18.200 --> 16:23.200
Look at her. She's crushed,
devastated by your shocking insensitivity

16:23.266 --> 16:25.300
-to her feelings.
-It's not that bad.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.467
Shut up, Rose.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.967
Look, I never said I was going.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.333
Well, since when do we
have to say we're going?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.333
We've gone for the past five years.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.633
-Sure, we may hate it but we always go.
-You never told me you hated it.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.066
That's because I'm a good friend.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.633
And a good friend would never
say anything like that.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.300
I appreciate that, Blanche.

16:43.367 --> 16:47.000
Just admit it, it's because you
don't like Barbara.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.900
All right. I think she's a phony.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.100
This from a woman who tells her dates

16:53.166 --> 16:56.433
that she was Angie Dickinson's body double
in <i>Dressed To Kill.</i>

16:57.900 --> 17:02.100
-That's just a little white lie.
-Then why is it on your job resume?

17:03.567 --> 17:07.834
Blanche is right, Dorothy.
Barbara is not very nice.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.900
She looks down on everybody except you,
and that's 'cause you look up to her.

17:11.967 --> 17:18.867
She uses her intelligence to make
everybody else look stupid, like tonight,

17:18.934 --> 17:21.567
asking us to pass the salt in Latin.

17:21.633 --> 17:25.133
She cares more about words
than about people.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.433
You're entitled to your own friends.

17:27.500 --> 17:32.433
Sometimes it takes a good friend
to point out your mistakes.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.967
How dare you make those judgments?

17:35.033 --> 17:38.033
And how dare you tell me
who my friends should be?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.133
Well.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.233
(calm music playing)

17:54.433 --> 17:58.834
-Barbara, this place is incredible.
-Yes. It's the hangout

17:58.900 --> 18:01.367
for Miami's literary intelligentsia.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.834
Ah, thank you.

18:05.633 --> 18:09.233
I've never seen a menu
with a table of contents.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.200
Chapter five is the lunch menu.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.967
Gee, everything sounds so good.

18:16.266 --> 18:17.734
"The crepes of wrath."

18:19.600 --> 18:22.233
"The old man
and the seafood salad."

18:23.033 --> 18:28.233
I think I will have the "For whom the
stuffed bell pepper tolls."

18:29.700 --> 18:34.400
A turkey sandwich on catcher
in the rye bread with George Bernard slaw.

18:36.367 --> 18:39.633
You know, Barbara,
I've come to value our friendship.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.367
That's why I feel I can talk to you
about something that's bothering me.

18:43.433 --> 18:47.900
I know if I had a problem,
I'd want to confide in someone like me.

18:50.166 --> 18:54.300
Well, ever since we became friends,
there's been a great deal of tension

18:54.367 --> 18:56.200
between Blanche and Rose and me.

18:56.266 --> 19:00.734
-Sorry. I didn't mean to infringe.
-It's not your fault.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.333
The problem is
they feel left out of our friendship.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.867
-I don't know what to do about it.
-Face it, Dorothy.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.033
Blanche and Rose are limited.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.600
Well, I admit I get tired of hearing
about Blanche's dates

19:15.667 --> 19:21.300
and Rose's relatives back in St. Olaf,
but they are very good friends.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.967
If you like them,
I must have overlooked something.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.767
I have an idea.

19:25.834 --> 19:30.567
Why don't I invite everybody and their
dates for dinner at the Mortimer club?

19:30.633 --> 19:35.800
Barbara, that is the most
exclusive club in town.

19:35.867 --> 19:38.867
-Here we are.
-I didn't order French fries.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.300
Right. You get Edgar Allan Poe-tatoes.

19:41.367 --> 19:44.100
-The ice water cometh.
-Uh, you know...

19:44.500 --> 19:47.600
a little of that goes a long way.

19:57.967 --> 19:59.767
Blanche, I'm having
second thoughts about

19:59.834 --> 20:02.200
spending another evening
with Barbara Thorndyke.

20:02.266 --> 20:04.133
I don't think it'll hurt
to give her another chance.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.333
Besides, we're going to the Mortimer club.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.734
What's the big deal
about the Mortimer club, anyway?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.467
Rose, the wealthiest men
in Florida go there.

20:11.533 --> 20:14.867
And it's always been my experience
that wealthy men make the best lovers.

20:14.934 --> 20:18.400
-Is that true?
-No. But if you tell them that,

20:18.467 --> 20:20.000
sometimes they'll take you to the mall

20:20.066 --> 20:22.500
and let you use their credit
card for 45 minutes.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.433
Oh, Blanche, honey,
I hope you don't mind,

20:26.500 --> 20:28.066
I borrowed
your rhinestone necklace.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.166
No, that's all right,
but I think I should point out

20:30.233 --> 20:32.033
it was designed for a dainty neck.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.867
Yes, Blanche, but I don't know Mike Tyson
well enough to borrow his jewelry.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.934
(doorbell chimes)

20:44.667 --> 20:47.166
-Hello, Madge.
-That's Blanche.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.633
Oh, didn't I say that?

20:49.433 --> 20:51.100
This is my date, Norman.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.667
He's a student in my
creative writing course.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.467
I didn't know you taught high school.

20:58.900 --> 21:02.266
Norman and I are the same age...
spiritually.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.834
If you can get him to buy that,
more power to you.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.033
-Hello, Barbara.
-Hi, Dorothy, Rose.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.767
I certainly hope tonight
will help us forget

21:13.834 --> 21:17.400
-what happened the other night.
-I already forgot what happened.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.000
Then again, I'm 82 years old.

21:20.066 --> 21:23.066
This morning I forgot
my cat's been dead for 20 years...

21:23.867 --> 21:26.567
which makes me wonder,
who's using the kitty litter?

21:29.834 --> 21:31.867
(doorbell chimes)

21:33.266 --> 21:34.633
Hello. Come in.

21:35.100 --> 21:40.767
Oh, Murray, what a snazzy tux.
I better not let you out of my sight.

21:41.533 --> 21:44.367
Meet my daughter Dorothy
and her friends.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.567
Everybody, I'd like you
to meet Murray Guttman.

21:46.633 --> 21:50.700
-Hello there.
-Murray, such a pleasure to meet you.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.100
Nice to meet you, too.

21:53.633 --> 21:56.066
Dorothy, could I see
you in the kitchen for a second?

22:01.767 --> 22:03.600
-We have a little problem.
-We do?

22:03.667 --> 22:05.800
Yes. Murray Guttman?

22:05.867 --> 22:11.400
Maybe he can turn his jacket inside out.
I'm sure the lining isn't as loud.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.400
-His tuxedo isn't the problem.
-I don't understand.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.266
-He can't enter the club.
-Why not?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.967
-Guttman.
-What are you talking about?

22:22.033 --> 22:24.133
Guttman. He's Jewish, isn't he?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.767
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

22:27.834 --> 22:31.533
A big difference.
The Mortimer club is restricted.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.867
Barbara, why are you
a member of this club?

22:34.934 --> 22:38.300
They serve a great breakfast,
and the parking is free.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.767
-It's not my policy.
-But you tolerate it.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.166
I tolerate a lot of things.

22:44.667 --> 22:48.834
For instance, I'm tolerating
this evening with Rose and Blanche

22:49.200 --> 22:50.800
because of my friendship with you.

22:51.300 --> 22:56.500
-I can't believe I'm hearing this.
-It's not a big thing.

22:56.567 --> 23:00.033
We can't go there,
so we'll go to another restaurant.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.734
Did I misjudge you.
Blanche and Rose were right.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.867
You're not the kind of person
I want as a friend.

23:07.266 --> 23:10.834
-Go to the club alone.
-I don't understand.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.233
Let me spell it out for you.

23:12.867 --> 23:14.533
Go to hell. Hmm?

23:25.166 --> 23:28.233
Dorothy, what happened?
Barbara just stormed out of here.

23:28.300 --> 23:31.934
She's not coming back.
You were right about her.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.734
I can't believe that I couldn't see it.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.967
Can you ever forgive me?

23:37.467 --> 23:40.033
Should we give her another chance?

23:40.500 --> 23:43.100
We better.
Best friends are hard to come by.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.567
Are you going to the ball?

23:46.633 --> 23:48.600
Yes. And I'll tell you something,

23:48.667 --> 23:54.700
after the practice I've had lately,
I'd be honored to be the horse's behind.

24:04.166 --> 24:09.600
(theme music playing)
