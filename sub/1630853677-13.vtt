07:51.138 --> 07:53.348
You and I were not together then. Okay.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.684
Well, who can keep track, right?

07:55.684 --> 07:56.894
Hey. Hey.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.105
Okay. Who's next?

08:00.105 --> 08:03.650
Someone maybe from your side
of the family can say a few words.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.570
- Debra, tell us about
your time in Dallas.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.323
Literally just talk would be great.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.041
I feel terrible, Angel.

08:19.917 --> 08:24.254
I mean, that was truly
the worst outcome imaginable, right?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.215

throw champagne in your face.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.887
Felt like a missed opportunity,
if you ask me.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.473

to the beginning

08:34.473 --> 08:36.058

08:36.058 --> 08:38.977

08:38.977 --> 08:40.646
Back when you still had your visions.

08:40.646 --> 08:43.607
Because that's what you should be

08:45.901 --> 08:47.819
Ooh, I like that.

- Are you writing your wedding speech
while you're talking to me?

08:53.492 --> 08:55.536
It's called having a beautiful mind.

08:55.536 --> 08:59.289
I can also smell colors
and see the future.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.291
I can't just move past this, Angel.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.961
I've jeopardized my friendship
with Ben and Jessie.

09:03.961 --> 09:07.256
Not to mention made things
very awkward at the duplex. And--

09:07.256 --> 09:10.050
- Don't forget, low-key
ruining Amy's rehearsal dinner.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.053
- Oh god. It's like everything bad
is happening all at once.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.766
This is it, right?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.686
This is the bad thing
that made me lose my visions.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.980
That's one theory.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.273
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.691
I was told I lost my visions

09:25.691 --> 09:27.276
because a bad thing was going to happen.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.319
I was even with Jessie when I lost them.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.654
I have to go talk to her.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.073
She's still my friend, Angel.
I have to make this right.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.576
Thank you. Good talk.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.790

where she started.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.792

09:45.961 --> 09:47.337
Ooh, I like that, too.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.008
It's open.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.428
- Is this a bad time?
- Well, it's not a great time, Ben.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.346
I'm about to get married in a low pony.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.016
Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.310
You were right all along.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.979
About me, about Jessie, about the wedding.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.816
I should have let you hire
that hair guy, Jazz Dirt.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.651
Oh, it's Chaz Dean.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.069
- Cha--
- Chaz Dean.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.322
And it's okay.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.990
I'm sorry, too.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.116
I was part of the secret,

10:16.116 --> 10:18.911
and I feel terrible
that Jessie got so upset.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.164
But the truth is,
is today is my wedding day,

10:22.164 --> 10:24.416
and I got Botox in my armpits this week.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.169
And if I get stressed, I don't know
where the sweat will come out.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.546
So... I'm fine.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.340
See?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.050
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.593
So how are things with you and Jessie?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.512
- Not too good.
- Mm.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.306
- We spent all night fighting,
and today she turned off her phone.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.225
What? Oh my god.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.893
Oh, she must be furious.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.561
My phone has literally never been off.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.605
I just, I don't know what to do.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.650
Okay, well, what do you want?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.985
- Well, I mean, I can't imagine
my life without her.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.531
Ben, that's not what I asked.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.700
It's not that simple, Amy.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.118
It's Jessie we're talking about.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.663
I spent most of my life
thinking she was the one.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.122
- Everybody did.
- Well, yeah.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.874
No, I remember our <i>abuela</i> Rosie

11:05.874 --> 11:08.043
giving you her wedding ring
when you were 15.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.003
- Yeah.
- Which was a real slap in the face

11:10.003 --> 11:11.672
because I had
a very serious boyfriend at the time,

11:11.672 --> 11:13.215
remember, Marcus?

11:13.215 --> 11:14.132
Peter.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.677
- Point is, is that
you shouldn't have to be

11:16.677 --> 11:18.428
with someone because
you have a past with them.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.056
You have to see a future with them too.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.725
- You know, you're right.
I just always assumed

11:23.725 --> 11:25.727
that Jessie and I would end up together.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.064
But starting to feel like fate
should be easier.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.149
- Well, if you are destined
to be together,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.193
and if she comes back,

11:34.486 --> 11:35.571
I would love that.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.990
Just don't be offended
if I asked you to step out

11:37.990 --> 11:39.116
of some of the wedding photos.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.242
Got it.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.494
I'm so happy for you, Amy.

11:43.579 --> 11:44.580
Dad would be happy too.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.581
Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.292
- Mm.
- I love you.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.293
I love you.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.712
Okay. Don't make me ruin my makeup.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.381
You already ruined my hair.
So get out of here.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.096
Thelma, whose hot dog is that?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.848
Hey, Louise.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.141
Small world.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.976
Oh, hey, it's you.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.477
I think your dog took my lunch.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.812
Well, unless you have the bun,

12:08.812 --> 12:10.689
there's really no evidence
that that's yours.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.151
- You mind if I sit?
I'm not trying to date you.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.279
Though I think our dogs
might be courting one another.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.489
You have a pug?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.241
Well, looks like they're doing
more than courting.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.118
- Yeah. Wow. Looks like
they're about to round third.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.995
Alright. You know what, guys? Break it up.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.371
There are puppies around here.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.166
Geez.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.793
SAM:
So Dave tells me you teach yoga, huh?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.879
That's so awesome. I'm terrible at it.

12:33.879 --> 12:34.922
Oh really?

12:34.922 --> 12:36.924
Well, you're welcome
to come to my class sometime.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.842
The rest of my students
can see how far they've come.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.761
I will do that.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.055
But in exchange,
you have to help me out tonight

12:43.055 --> 12:44.848
if I get cornered by Dave's sing-along.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.851
Oh. Sorry. Can't help you with that one.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.728
That would be going against girl code,

12:49.728 --> 12:52.564
and I am nothing if not a woman of my...

12:54.816 --> 12:56.276
word. So--

12:57.319 --> 12:59.112
Sorry, what shoe size
did you say you wear?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.406
- Shoes?
- Yeah. You know what?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.700
Don't, don't answer that
because I'm not dating.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.661
Oh. Okay.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.211
Ben's not here right now.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.214
- I'm not looking for Ben.
I'm looking for you.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.759
And for a place
to put these apology olives.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.303
Apparently, they don't sell olive branches
at grocery stores,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.055
and they give you weird looks if you ask.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.017
Jessie, I'm so sorry.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.609
Wait.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.570
Where are you going?

13:40.112 --> 13:41.864
My cousin's letting me stay with her.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.157
She has pregnant chickens,
but it's still better than here.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.618
Aren't chickens always pregnant?

13:47.744 --> 13:49.121
Or are they ever pregnant?

13:51.874 --> 13:54.251
- Jessie, please don't go.
This is all my fault.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.545
I was the one that told Ben
not to tell you about it,

13:56.545 --> 13:59.631
and I was trying to protect
your feelings and I was wrong.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.757
I'm sorry.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.218
- Look, I'm not just leaving
because of that.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.265
I'm sick of being with someone
who can't decide what he wants.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.642
I mean, it takes the guy two hours

14:10.642 --> 14:13.562
to decide what he wants for dinner
and apparently 14 years

14:13.562 --> 14:14.980
to decide if he wants to be with me.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.150
He'll miss this? Right?

14:19.735 --> 14:22.237
- He'll miss you.
- He always does.

14:22.738 --> 14:26.450
But I need someone
who appreciates me when I'm here.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.119
I want someone who's devoted
to building a future.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.289
And look, if that were the case,
he would have told me the truth.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.877
Jessie, wait.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.218
He'll miss this too.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.683
Were you in love with him?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.394
No.

14:55.938 --> 14:56.980
Well, lucky you.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.319
Sorry.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.612
That's my mom.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.364
Careful what you tell her.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.291
Mom.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.507
I just don't understand it.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.926
How come he gets crayons?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.720
Because he's a kid, Jack.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.347
That's a stupid rule.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.141
Why are we meeting here?

15:33.851 --> 15:36.311
- Well, honey, your mom
thought it would be safer

15:36.311 --> 15:39.857
to meet in a public place
where things couldn't get so heated.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.483
And who could be mad

15:41.483 --> 15:44.528
with limitless baskets of breadsticks?

15:44.528 --> 15:45.988
Me. I can.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.781
- Okay.
Well, Daddy tried.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.575
Mom, why did you tell

15:50.659 --> 15:52.411
Jessie about me and Ben?

15:52.411 --> 15:54.037
I told you that in confidence.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.249
- Please don't be upset, Maggie.
I feel terrible.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.042
I just assumed Jessie knew.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.252
Why would you assume that?

16:00.252 --> 16:02.713
- Because when something
is going on in your life,

16:02.713 --> 16:04.840
I'm always the last person
to know about it.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.258
Oh! I wonder why.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.968
Have we decided yet

16:07.968 --> 16:10.012
or should I go away for the fourth time?

16:10.387 --> 16:11.805
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.224
Yes. I would like some crayons.

16:15.184 --> 16:16.185
Thank you.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.271
Please forgive me, Maggie.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.982
Haven't you ever made a mistake
and wished you could take it back?

16:25.611 --> 16:27.112
Yes, I can forgive you,

16:27.112 --> 16:29.573
but how am I supposed
to trust you ever again?

16:30.574 --> 16:31.575
Well,

16:31.575 --> 16:34.953
maybe you could see that
I won't make the same mistake again.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.663
I'm sorry. I can't.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.665
Oh, Maggie, come on.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.334
Your mother's losing her hair.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.753
You can't have two bald parents.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.088
They make documentaries
about things like that.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.466
No, that's not what I meant.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.427
I didn't want to tell you guys, but

16:52.012 --> 16:53.096
I lost my visions.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.181
- You what?
- Oh.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.474
- See, this is what I mean.
Okay, honey.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.100
Oh, my sweet girl.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.687
Oh, but it's your whole life.
It's your livelihood.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.022
It's everything.
I know.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.440
What happened?

17:04.358 --> 17:08.695
- Supposedly, my mind
was just trying to protect me

17:08.695 --> 17:10.322
from some bad event happening.

17:10.322 --> 17:13.534
Obviously, the thing with Jessie
was the bad event.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.747
- But if that was the bad thing,
then why didn't you get them back yet?

17:21.166 --> 17:22.251
I don't know.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.461
Oh, Maggie.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.589
I'm so sorry you've been going
through this all on your own.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.216
Yeah. Me too.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.093
I really want them back.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.268
Ugh. Why am I losing everything?

17:41.770 --> 17:42.771
Louise.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.568
- Looking for this?
- Oh, yes.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.444
You were so eager to run away earlier

17:49.444 --> 17:51.405
that this earring
somehow jettisoned off your body

17:51.405 --> 17:53.699
- and onto my carpet.
- Thank you, Angel.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.033
You are a saint.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.035
Not officially. Too much paperwork.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.914
- Did my psychic visions happen
to appear in your carpet, too?

18:00.914 --> 18:04.501
- Oh, good. You are finally asking
the right questions.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.129
- Well, I just don't understand
why they haven't come back yet.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.882
I mean... the bad thing is over.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.092
Yeah? So what am I missing?

18:12.092 --> 18:14.011
- Well, maybe it's got nothing
to do with that.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.847
Maybe your visions went away
because you weren't owning them.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.058
I literally put a sign over my door

18:20.058 --> 18:22.603
that says "Psychic" in neon lights.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.979
Look,

18:23.979 --> 18:25.898
all I know is you were given a gift

18:25.898 --> 18:28.233
for a reason, to help people.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.777
Now, if you're sitting
on that gift in any way

18:30.777 --> 18:32.321
and not sharing it,

18:32.321 --> 18:34.364
that might cause it to pack up and leave.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.200
What exactly am I sitting on?

18:37.117 --> 18:40.913
- Have you ever heard that
when God closes a door,

18:40.913 --> 18:42.748
- they open a window?
- Uh-huh.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.709
- Well, sometimes we have
to close our own doors.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.503
What about the windows?

18:47.503 --> 18:49.379
Oh my god. Sweetie, it's a metaphor.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.132
Or maybe it's a parable.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.302
I guess that depends
on what you do with it.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.137
- Huh?
- I'll see you tonight.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.274
♪

19:09.274 --> 19:11.652
♪

19:16.031 --> 19:17.533
Thought you decided on chocolate.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.117
Yeah.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.579
Then I spilled it and made
a huge mess of everything.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.831
I'm really sorry, Ben.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.292
I never, ever meant to

19:28.293 --> 19:29.670
ruin your relationship.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.129
Maggie, you didn't.

19:32.631 --> 19:33.632
The truth is

19:34.550 --> 19:37.761
Jessie and I would never
even have gotten back together

19:37.761 --> 19:39.263
if you didn't give me
that psychic reading.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.557
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.559
You said I would find love,

19:44.643 --> 19:47.312
and I actually thought I might be with you

19:48.188 --> 19:51.483
and it ended,
and... it was Jessie.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.318
You know.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.490
There's something I have to tell you

19:58.490 --> 20:00.409
about the reading I gave you.

20:00.909 --> 20:01.910
Yeah?

20:02.286 --> 20:03.287
What did you see?

20:05.956 --> 20:08.876
I thought I saw us falling in love.

20:10.419 --> 20:11.837
- You did?
- Yeah.

20:13.005 --> 20:16.717
- And I also thought I saw
I was having a kid

20:16.717 --> 20:19.845
and a whole life and road trips.

20:20.679 --> 20:21.680
Oh.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.056
Yeah.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.101
Did you want that?

20:31.857 --> 20:32.858
I was wrong.

20:34.776 --> 20:38.030
I had a vision of you marrying Jessie.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.741
She's who you end up with.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.619
- You actually saw us--
- At the altar.

20:45.746 --> 20:46.788
It's going to happen.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.835
And you guys looked really happy.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.297
Wow.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.548
- Mm-hmm.

20:57.508 --> 20:59.635
- I guess it's just hard
to believe right now because

21:03.472 --> 21:04.806
I have no idea where to find her.

21:07.518 --> 21:09.770
- She's at her cousin's.
- Really?

21:10.562 --> 21:11.980
She's the one, Ben.

21:13.357 --> 21:16.318
She's your future,
and all she wants is to know that.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.487
You got to go and tell her that.

21:20.072 --> 21:21.907
And you got to start believing it, too.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.661
Okay.

21:28.747 --> 21:29.915
- Maggie.
- Yeah.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.043
Thanks.

- I'd like to welcome everyone
to our ceremony.

22:46.700 --> 22:50.913
We are gathered here to honor
something ageless and pure.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.040
But enough about me.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.713
Although you have to admit,
I do look good.

Ow.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.926
ANGEL:
Okay, I'm going to be serious now

23:03.926 --> 23:05.552
because we are actually here

23:05.552 --> 23:08.514
to celebrate something
wonderfully profound.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.225
Love.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.939
When Amy and Dave first met,

23:17.439 --> 23:19.900
they stood at an altar in the desert,

23:19.900 --> 23:21.610
declaring their love to one another.

23:23.070 --> 23:26.573
And now, here they are again

23:27.449 --> 23:28.617
right where they started.

23:32.663 --> 23:35.707
That's why this particular
exchanging of rings

23:35.707 --> 23:38.085
is so poetic,

23:38.085 --> 23:40.254
because a ring is also something

23:40.254 --> 23:43.423
that ends right where it begins.

when you least expect it to.</i>

24:05.737 --> 24:08.156
- Hey, I heard the valet
just crashed your car.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.867
- What?
- They did?

24:09.867 --> 24:11.743
- Mm.
- Oh, that's terrible.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.871
I should probably leave here and go see.

24:13.871 --> 24:14.872
Yeah.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.666
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're so welcome.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.088
Mm.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.215
Girl, you make divorce look so good.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.800
I want to leave somebody.
