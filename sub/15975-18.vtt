42:41.327 --> 42:42.556
<i>Previously on "Sports Night"...</i>

42:42.629 --> 42:44.791
"I think you're cute, and
I've had fun talking to you,

42:44.864 --> 42:46.263
and I'd like you
to ask me out."

42:46.332 --> 42:47.094
Yes.

42:47.167 --> 42:48.430
You're dating a porn star?

42:48.501 --> 42:50.435
It might rain
at Indian Wells.

42:50.503 --> 42:54.167
-- If it does, we stay on the air for the
second round. -- I'm not staying on the air.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.607
<i>You know, Casey, I'm getting
a little tired of you being</i>

42:56.676 --> 42:58.269
<i>senior camp counselor
around here.</i>

42:58.344 --> 43:00.711
Hey, you know what? If you're
not here, then I can't use you.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.477
-- When did I become Ed McMahon to you? --
No, you're not, and you know it, all right?

43:03.550 --> 43:05.143
But I need to be able
to do my show.

43:05.218 --> 43:07.414
-- And when did it become your show?
-- Come on, we're on the air.

43:07.487 --> 43:09.478
I'm transferring live footage
to your monitors.

43:09.556 --> 43:10.751
<i>Take a look.</i>

43:11.958 --> 43:14.120
It's raining
at Indian Wells.

43:17.897 --> 43:20.992
<i>Casey: A 6'7", 325-pound
tackle out of Oregon State,</i>

43:21.067 --> 43:23.035
Anthony Papajohn,
goes to Tampa Bay

43:23.102 --> 43:25.230
with the 22nd pick
in the first round.

43:25.305 --> 43:27.899
Dan, I'm told at the
Scouting Combine last winter

43:27.974 --> 43:29.908
that Papajohn ran
the 40-yard dash

43:29.976 --> 43:31.000
in 4.4 seconds.

43:31.077 --> 43:33.171
That's pretty fast
for somebody his size.

43:33.246 --> 43:35.408
That's pretty fast for
someone anyone's size,

43:35.481 --> 43:37.176
though I suppose
any play designed

43:37.250 --> 43:39.184
for an offensive lineman
to run 40 yards

43:39.252 --> 43:41.346
is probably ill-conceived.

43:41.421 --> 43:43.185
Let's go back to the Garden,
[Door opens]

43:43.256 --> 43:45.384
Where Kelly Kirkpatrick
is standing by live. Kelly?

43:45.458 --> 43:46.892
Fire me.

43:48.228 --> 43:49.161
What?

43:49.229 --> 43:50.697
Fire me. Do it now.

43:50.763 --> 43:52.288
-- Why?
- I'm a bad worker.

43:52.365 --> 43:54.424
-- No, you're not.
-- I come late, I leave early.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.626
You come early
and you stay late.

43:55.702 --> 43:57.295
You come in on
your days off.

43:57.370 --> 43:59.031
And isn't that
a little weird?

43:59.105 --> 44:00.231
Oh, yeah.

44:00.306 --> 44:01.796
<i>Well, then, enough's
enough, Isaac. Fire me.</i>

44:01.874 --> 44:03.205
I'm not firing you.

44:03.276 --> 44:04.539
I say things behind your back.

44:04.611 --> 44:05.544
No, you don't.

44:05.612 --> 44:06.807
It's behind your back, Isaac.

44:06.879 --> 44:08.040
There's no way you'd know.

44:08.114 --> 44:09.548
It'd get back to me.

44:09.616 --> 44:10.879
No, these things are
too terrible,

44:10.950 --> 44:12.145
and I can't live
with the guilt.

44:12.218 --> 44:13.379
I'll save you the trouble
of firing me

44:13.453 --> 44:15.478
and simply offer
my resignation.

44:15.555 --> 44:17.580
-- I won't accept it.
-- You have to accept it.

44:17.657 --> 44:18.647
You have a contract.

44:18.725 --> 44:20.454
-- Then fire me.
-- No.

44:21.694 --> 44:23.856
I'm a racist.

44:23.930 --> 44:25.125
Really?

44:25.198 --> 44:27.667
Yeah, I'm a terrible racist, but I've
been in the closet all these years,

44:27.734 --> 44:30.203
and I've decided I need
to live an honest life.

44:30.270 --> 44:33.433
And I think all those people with the
different skin colors and the funny accents

44:33.506 --> 44:35.133
should go back
where they came from

44:35.208 --> 44:36.937
and leave America
to the white people

44:37.010 --> 44:39.342
who killed the Indians in the first
place -- which they deserved.

44:39.412 --> 44:42.040
-- Jeremy... -- The whole country's being
taken over by the blacks and the Jews.

44:42.115 --> 44:44.641
-- You're Jewish. -- VVell,
I've got to be stopped, Isaac.

44:44.717 --> 44:46.412
Jeremy, what is the matter
with you?

44:46.486 --> 44:48.477
I'm totally screwed!

44:53.559 --> 44:55.493
<i>Jeremy:
I'm totally screwed.</i>

44:55.561 --> 44:58.030
<i>Isaac: Porn star problems?
-- Yes.</i>

44:58.097 --> 44:59.861
-- She's coming here?
-- Yes.

44:59.932 --> 45:01.559
-- This afternoon?
-- Yes.

45:01.634 --> 45:03.102
Natalie doesn't know
about her yet?

45:03.169 --> 45:04.694
She knows I'm seeing someone.

45:04.771 --> 45:06.535
But she doesn't know
it's a porn star.

45:06.606 --> 45:08.938
Do we have to
call her a porn star?

45:09.008 --> 45:12.342
Can we call her an adult-film
actress or simply Jenny?

45:12.412 --> 45:14.005
Is it important
that we say "porn star"

45:14.080 --> 45:15.377
as many times as possible?

45:15.448 --> 45:17.542
Can we have a civilization,
for crying out loud?

45:17.617 --> 45:20.211
Okay, okay,
you're freaking out again.

45:20.286 --> 45:21.219
Yes.

45:21.287 --> 45:23.153
Why'd you ask Jenny
to come here?

45:23.222 --> 45:24.986
I wanted to demonstrate
to her

45:25.058 --> 45:27.220
that I have no problem
with who she is

45:27.293 --> 45:29.057
or what she does
for a living,

45:29.128 --> 45:30.721
that I can bring her
to my workplace,

45:30.797 --> 45:31.992
my place of business,

45:32.065 --> 45:35.467
and introduce her to my friends
with my head held high,

45:35.535 --> 45:37.401
with no puritanical
judgments,

45:37.470 --> 45:40.462
that it's her and me and let the rest of
the world be damned if they don't like it.

45:40.540 --> 45:42.872
I told her to come here
today so she could see

45:42.942 --> 45:44.808
I'm not the person
she thinks I am.

45:44.877 --> 45:45.935
And?

45:46.012 --> 45:47.980
I'm <i>exactly</i> the person
she thinks I am.

45:48.047 --> 45:49.572
Well, that's not too bad.

45:49.649 --> 45:51.083
I told her to
come here at 3:00,

45:51.150 --> 45:53.244
knowing we'd be done
with the first-round coverage

45:53.319 --> 45:56.254
by midday and Natalie
would be gone by then.

45:56.322 --> 45:57.790
You know the only thing
that could foil my plan?

45:57.857 --> 46:01.157
Yeah, if it started to rain
at Indian Wells.

46:01.227 --> 46:04.356
-- How can it be raining at Indian VVells?
-- Maybe it's the rainy season.

46:04.430 --> 46:05.829
Indian Wells
is a desert, Isaac.

46:05.898 --> 46:08.833
If deserts had a rainy season,
they'd be called something else.

46:08.901 --> 46:10.630
Fair point.

46:10.703 --> 46:13.570
I also told Natalie that
Jenny is a choreo-animator.

46:13.639 --> 46:16.609
What's a choreo-animator?

46:16.676 --> 46:19.373
Someone who choreographs
the dances in cartoons.

46:19.445 --> 46:22.039
-- You mean like the hippos
in <i>Fantasia?</i> -- Yeah.

46:22.115 --> 46:23.708
That's a great job.

46:23.783 --> 46:26.616
Nothing wrong with being
a choreo-animator.

46:26.686 --> 46:29.883
Right, except she's not
a choreo-animator,

46:29.956 --> 46:32.448
-- she's a porn star.
-- Damn!

46:32.525 --> 46:34.926
You're telling me these people
can't play tennis in the rain?

46:34.994 --> 46:36.257
Well, those are clay courts
out there.

46:36.329 --> 46:39.390
And I think probably the ball
would lose a little bounce

46:39.465 --> 46:40.557
coming off the mud.

46:40.633 --> 46:42.761
Net game, net game,
net game!

46:42.835 --> 46:44.234
Whatever happened
to the fundamentals?!

46:44.303 --> 46:47.204
For the love of God, a little
civilization is all I ask!

46:47.273 --> 46:49.571
-- Jeremy...
-- Right.

46:49.642 --> 46:51.906
So...

46:51.978 --> 46:53.377
Fire me.

46:53.446 --> 46:56.381
Sorry, kid, you're too good.
I need you here.

46:56.449 --> 46:58.577
What if I stand
right in your office

46:58.651 --> 47:02.986
and look you in the eye
and call you Sambo?

47:03.055 --> 47:06.150
[Laughs]

47:06.225 --> 47:08.284
Thanks for stopping by,
Jeremy.

47:08.361 --> 47:09.385
You crack me up.

47:09.462 --> 47:10.793
-- I didn't sell it.
-- No.

47:10.863 --> 47:12.592
How do the real racists
do it?

47:12.665 --> 47:14.064
<i>It's too late for you, son.</i>

47:14.133 --> 47:15.760
You got to be taught
by your parents.

47:15.835 --> 47:16.996
I suppose.

47:17.069 --> 47:18.230
Go back to work.

47:18.304 --> 47:19.931
Yes, sir.

47:20.006 --> 47:22.270
<i>Casey: Offensive tackle

47:22.341 --> 47:24.002

47:24.076 --> 47:27.239
Pittsburgh's on the clock.
We're gonna take a quick break.

47:27.313 --> 47:29.941
You're watching live coverage
of Draft Day 2000

47:30.016 --> 47:32.075
<i>right here on CSC,
so stick around.</i>

47:32.151 --> 47:33.175
We're out.

47:33.252 --> 47:35.550
-- That was funny before --
-- Yeah?

47:35.621 --> 47:38.454
About if a lineman
has to run 40 yards,

47:38.524 --> 47:40.049
this play was probably
ill-conceived.

47:40.126 --> 47:41.958
Thanks.

47:43.196 --> 47:45.164
-- Look, Danny...
-- Drop dead.

47:45.231 --> 47:46.756
You owe me an apology,
jackass.

47:46.833 --> 47:49.131
And until I get one,
keep your reviews to yourself.

47:49.202 --> 47:50.465
I'm sorry.

47:50.536 --> 47:52.903
-- Yeah?
-- I'm very sorry.

47:52.972 --> 47:54.531
I don't think you are.

47:54.607 --> 47:57.406
I am. In fact, I'm so sorry,
it's almost hard for me

47:57.477 --> 47:59.605
to think of different ways
to say "bite me."

47:59.679 --> 48:01.204
I think you've come up with
quite enough for one day.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.009
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I don't think I have.

48:03.082 --> 48:05.278
Look, can we continue this
conversation someplace else?

48:05.351 --> 48:07.217
No, I want to stay out here,
Casey. I don't want to miss

48:07.286 --> 48:09.880
a precious moment
of Draft Day 2000.

48:09.956 --> 48:12.118
[Sighs ] Would you get
your ass back here?

48:21.801 --> 48:23.667
You understand when you
throw a hissy fit

48:23.736 --> 48:26.535
'cause a rainout at Indian VVells
means you got to work longer,

48:26.606 --> 48:29.405
you send seismic shock waves
through an organization

48:29.475 --> 48:31.534
full of people who are under the impression
we all enjoy doing this together?

48:31.611 --> 48:34.706
It's not part of my job to make sure
every/body's having a good time, okay?

48:34.780 --> 48:36.373
If it is,
I need to be paid more.

48:36.449 --> 48:38.315
I manage to do it whether
it's a part of my job or not.

48:38.384 --> 48:40.182
Maybe that's 'cause
you are paid more.

48:41.254 --> 48:42.983
Well, I'm paid considerably
more, Danny.

48:43.055 --> 48:44.989
Is that what you want
to talk about?

48:45.057 --> 48:46.684
Well, excuse me
for finding it baffling.

48:46.759 --> 48:49.729
We do the exact same work. I write half
the show. You write half the show.

48:49.795 --> 48:51.763
VVell, maybe it's because who
knows when you're gonna decide

48:51.831 --> 48:53.492
you'd rather play 18 holes
than anchor team coverage?

48:53.566 --> 48:56.934
God, Casey, aren't you interested in
having any life at all outside the studio?

48:57.003 --> 49:00.405
Not really, but when I
do decide to step out,

49:00.473 --> 49:02.999
will you be the one to show me how it
goes, 'cause your life's so hot, Danny?

49:05.177 --> 49:07.009
We didn't have enough to fight about
-- you had to bring up the money?

49:07.079 --> 49:10.344
Sorry. Was I bringing
you down on Draft Day 2000?

49:12.251 --> 49:14.481
Why don't you go into the control
room and pick up the troops?

49:14.554 --> 49:16.818
That will make you
feel better.

49:16.889 --> 49:20.621
You know what? I'm a capitalist
like everyone else in this country,

49:20.693 --> 49:23.060
and I'm paid exactly
what the market will bear.

49:23.129 --> 49:25.154
My agent asks for an amount,
and that's what they pay me,

49:25.231 --> 49:27.962
'cause they know if they
don't, somebody else will.

49:28.034 --> 49:31.197
You ask for the same thing, they won't
pay it to you because nobody else will.

49:31.270 --> 49:32.203
Meaning?

49:32.271 --> 49:33.295
You came with me.
Deal with it.

two minutes and change
before they announce

49:52.592 --> 49:54.924
their first pick of the draft,
who very likely will be...

49:54.994 --> 49:56.519
My man Lashon.

Lashon be the mon --
Lashon Tarrington

49:58.598 --> 49:59.724
of the Florida State
Seminoles,

49:59.799 --> 50:02.234
the wide receiver
drafted out of FSU.

50:02.301 --> 50:04.793
-- What were the odds?
-- Very good indeed.

50:04.870 --> 50:08.170
-- You know, I came this close to being drafted
as a wide receiver? -- Really? What happened?

50:08.240 --> 50:10.868
Well, I never actually
played organized ball.

50:10.943 --> 50:13.776
-- Ah. -- And even if I had, I wasn't
fast enough to be a wide receiver.

50:13.846 --> 50:16.508
-- But other than that...
-- This close, my friend.

50:16.582 --> 50:18.141
Pittsburgh's made
their selection.

50:18.217 --> 50:20.618
Let's go to the Garden for the
commissioner's announcement.

I really am.

you'd all be happy, too,

-- <i>Dana, Elliot has something
he'd like to say.</i> -- Yeah?

50:36.402 --> 50:37.961
No, I don't.

50:38.037 --> 50:39.596
-- Yes, you do.
Dana: <i>Guys?</i>

50:39.672 --> 50:41.936
-- You're driving him nutsy

50:42.008 --> 50:43.976
<i>I, on the other hand,
would like one.</i>

50:44.043 --> 50:46.137

As a matter of fact, I do. She's
a professional choreo-animator.

51:12.405 --> 51:14.339
She teaches dances
to cartoon characters?

51:14.407 --> 51:16.341
She doesn't teach them.
She makes them up.

51:16.409 --> 51:19.071
-- Of course. -- Then she demonstrates
them to the animators, who draw --

51:29.955 --> 51:31.616
could anything be
more symbolic?

fundamentally 'cause I wanted

51:33.459 --> 51:34.949
to experience
more of the world,

51:35.027 --> 51:36.620

with what he had.

the rest of his life

very safe and happy childhood.

only hurt that part of your face?

the trajectory or anything.

-- Yeah? -- Special circumstances.
It's your ex-girlfriend.

You made up a story 'cause you knew how

Well, that's great,

the story for Natalie.

That's the point.

52:59.078 --> 53:01.479
She shouldn't ever have to
deal with that again, not ever.

59:46.752 --> 59:47.685
Hey.

59:47.753 --> 59:49.187
-- [ Gasps]
-- Oh, sorry.

59:49.254 --> 59:50.688
Oh, you scared me.

59:50.756 --> 59:52.383
Sorry.

59:52.457 --> 59:54.949
I should give you
that 100 bucks now.

59:55.027 --> 59:57.962
There's still 21 picks
left in the second round.

59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.192
I missed five.
Did you get Rofofsky?

01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:03.701
-- Yeah.
-- Have you missed any so far?

01:00:03.769 --> 01:00:05.760
-- No. -- I gotta get back.
[Chuckles]

01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:08.306
Dana, I'm not saying
you've got the physical grace

01:00:08.373 --> 01:00:10.865
-- of a cougar or anything...
-- Look...

01:00:10.943 --> 01:00:12.775
but you don't just fall down.

01:00:12.844 --> 01:00:15.404
-- My skin breaks out.
-- I know.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.142
I was there in college
and that time in I.A.

01:00:18.217 --> 01:00:21.517
It's a recurring
nervous condition.

01:00:21.587 --> 01:00:23.146
What happened?

01:00:23.222 --> 01:00:24.917
[Chuckles]
It recurred.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.652
What are you nervous about?

01:00:27.726 --> 01:00:29.956
L...don't know.

01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:31.223
Is it the show?

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:36.430
I...
[Sighs]

01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.969
[Exhales sharply]

01:00:38.036 --> 01:00:40.095
...really don't know.

01:00:40.172 --> 01:00:41.765
Look, don't worry about me
and Danny, all right?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.639
Oh, I could kill him
sometimes.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.804
He blew off the golf game. He
stayed for the second round.

01:00:46.878 --> 01:00:48.505
I'm supposed to
consider that magnanimous?

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.914
<i>No...but don't worry
about it.</i>

01:00:51.984 --> 01:00:55.318
-- They put together some stuff
on Ryan O'Brian for you. -- Yeah.

01:00:55.387 --> 01:00:57.651
<i>Give us a 30-,
45-second intro,</i>

01:00:57.723 --> 01:00:59.623
then throw it to Callie
at the Garden.

01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:02.160
She'll do a quick stand-up,
then right back to you.

01:01:02.227 --> 01:01:03.922
-- This set?
-- Yeah.

01:01:03.996 --> 01:01:06.693
Okay. So don't worry
about it.

01:01:06.765 --> 01:01:09.598
I should have had
more T-shirts made.

01:01:09.668 --> 01:01:10.965
Well, next year.

01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:12.526
Next year I will.

01:01:14.006 --> 01:01:18.375
Uh, okay...
[Chuckles] Let's go.

01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:26.347
You'll ask Casey what it means to drop
from the first to the second round.

01:01:26.418 --> 01:01:27.783
-- He'll tell me.
-- Yes.

01:01:27.853 --> 01:01:29.821
Then you'll ask about
the Higgins-Ferris test.

01:01:29.888 --> 01:01:31.378
-- And he'll tell me.
-- Yes.

01:01:31.456 --> 01:01:33.481
-- Let me ask you a question.
-- Yeah?

01:01:33.558 --> 01:01:35.424
-- Why isn't he asking me?
-- Danny...

01:01:35.494 --> 01:01:37.326
No, I mean, why am I always
the one who -- who asks,

01:01:37.396 --> 01:01:38.864
and he's always
the one who knows?

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.420
You're not always
the one, Danny.

01:01:40.499 --> 01:01:42.661
My assignments are very even.
What's more, you know that.

01:01:42.734 --> 01:01:43.826
Not today.

01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:45.461
<i>Dave: 10 seconds live.
-- <i>Today I'm pissed at you,</i></i>

01:01:45.537 --> 01:01:49.030
and I'm in no mood to make you look smart.
You don't like it, lump it.

01:01:49.107 --> 01:01:52.805
-- Natalie... -- Take it down the
road and dump it. Here we g0!

01:01:52.878 --> 01:01:54.004
<i>Hey, we're doing the, uh</i> --

01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:55.240
-- Yeah.
-- Okay.

01:01:55.314 --> 01:01:57.043
In 3...2...

01:01:57.115 --> 01:01:59.743
We're back. One of the stories
we've been tracking today

01:01:59.818 --> 01:02:02.412
is the fall of
quarterback Ryan O'Brian,

01:02:02.487 --> 01:02:04.387
the fifth-year senior
out of Clemson

01:02:04.456 --> 01:02:06.754
and the runner-up for
this year's Heisman Trophy.

01:02:06.825 --> 01:02:09.556
O'Brien was projected as a
middle to late first-round pick.

01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:11.255
Here we are
in the second round,

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.128
and Ryan
and the O'Brien family

01:02:13.198 --> 01:02:15.394
are still waiting
for the phone to ring.

01:02:15.467 --> 01:02:18.926
Casey, tell us,
why should we care?

01:02:19.805 --> 01:02:21.102
What the hell is he --

01:02:21.173 --> 01:02:22.698
-- Why should we care?
-- Yeah.

01:02:22.774 --> 01:02:24.264
<i>Well, a drop from
the first round</i>

01:02:24.343 --> 01:02:26.277
to the second round
represents a loss

01:02:26.345 --> 01:02:28.279
of millions of dollars
to the player.

01:02:28.347 --> 01:02:30.281
Well, that's why Ryan O'Brien
should care.

01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:32.283
-- I'm asking why <i>we</i> should care.
-- Ah.

01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:34.319
We're doing it on our show.
There must be a reason

01:02:34.386 --> 01:02:35.615
<i>we think our viewers
should or might care</i>

01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:36.950
<i>that this 22-year-old
quarterback</i>

01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:41.858
from Clemson's gonna make only $3 million
his first year instead of $5 million.

01:02:43.228 --> 01:02:47.859
Well, I, uh...

01:02:47.933 --> 01:02:49.423
Good answer, Casey.

01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:51.162
We're gonna go to
Callie Gathers at the Garden.

01:02:51.236 --> 01:02:53.000
Maybe she can help us out.
Callie?

01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:56.132
<i>“We're out. Callie: Thanks, Dan.

-- Look...

01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:59.202
No, I mean, what the hell
are you doing, Danny?

01:03:03.615 --> 01:03:05.140
I'm sorry.

01:03:06.385 --> 01:03:08.854
I'm really sorry, Casey.
That -- that was over the line.

01:03:11.022 --> 01:03:13.582
I'm really sorry.
