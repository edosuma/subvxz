[Simmons] Get set, fire!

00:51.426 --> 00:52.260
All right!

00:53.094 --> 00:56.222
I call it "Romper Blaster."

00:56.723 --> 00:58.224
How do you come up with this stuff?

00:58.433 --> 01:02.896
Ah, I was sick and tired of spending
so much time dressing my dollies,

01:03.188 --> 01:07.317
and I figured parents felt the same way
about dressing babies.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.570
So why not blast their clothes on?
[laughs]

01:10.820 --> 01:12.322
Violence is so fun.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.909
As my mentor, Dr. Stubenhaus, always said,

01:15.992 --> 01:18.119
"You'd be amazed how inventive you can be

01:18.203 --> 01:20.497
when you're dang sick of something."
[laughs]

01:20.747 --> 01:22.332
Impressive, Simmons.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.084
But market research
shows only 14 percent of parents

01:25.168 --> 01:27.420
are comfortable firing cannons
at their babies.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.546
This is useless.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.924
Outstandingly useless.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.845
Brava. The frontier of our dreams
lies at the edge of our nightmares.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.681
-What is happening at this company? Aah!
-That terrible toy

01:38.765 --> 01:41.351
is what this week
in research and development is about.

01:41.434 --> 01:45.563
Stop thinking.
Solve problems that don't exist.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.859
Forget about Stinkless Serum
and anything else that matters.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.321
Now is not the time
to think outside the box.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.282
This week, we  smash  the box.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.911
And then we rebuild it. Wiser.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.246
-Boss Baby!
-[yelps]

02:01.329 --> 02:04.415
How are you smashing the box?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.835
Mentally? Spiritually?

02:07.418 --> 02:10.505
Eh... sledgehammerly?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.883
You fail to grasp the spirit
of "Smash the Box."

02:14.509 --> 02:15.552
Disappointing.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.722
Ma'am, wait!
Just point me at the box you want smashed!

02:19.806 --> 02:20.640
What's this?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.353
Oopsie Baby Booster,
the Chair Safety Warning System.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.480
It's not quite ready yet.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.942
[Oopsie Baby]  Oopsie!
Baby's falling off the chair.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.110
Seems to work fine.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.862
Seems to.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.656
-But if the baby leans too far--
-Simmons!

02:36.906 --> 02:39.993
Turtleneck always loves your work.
Throw me a crumb, anything.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.286
Uh, we're good here.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.746
Maybe you can smash boxes
in your department.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.458
Field operations doesn't have boxes,
just assorted paperwork.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.836
The odd manila file folder and-- [gasps]

02:49.919 --> 02:53.798
Wait a minute! I know how to seize
the inside track on becoming the next CEO!

02:53.882 --> 02:54.716
[Tim] Look at me.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.926
-I'm an Oopsie Baby.
-[Oopsie Baby]  Oopsie!

02:57.010 --> 02:59.095
-Don't lean too far!
-[Tim shouts]

02:59.178 --> 03:01.264
[Oopsie Baby]
Baby's falling off the chair.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.727
-Still working on the Consequence matrix.
-[Tim yowls]

03:06.102 --> 03:09.397
That was awesome. [spits]
What else you got?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.567
Free business tip:

03:12.650 --> 03:15.612
there's no better way to impress a boss
than being proactive.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.781
Like that time I cleaned my room
without Mom and Dad asking.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.326
[laughs] That never happened.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.995
Templeton, meet the Lonesome Files,

03:24.078 --> 03:27.498
the most frustrating, difficult
company problems you can imagine.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
And I'm going to solve them all.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.128
Sounds hard and boring.
We should just invent stuff.

03:32.211 --> 03:36.090
Like this thing Simmons gave me.
No idea what it does, but it looks cool.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.052
-Rain check. This is-- ow!
-Whoa! Sorry.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.929
Is your punching box through?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.389
Who's to say?
Mysteries of science, really.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.641
Let's see.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.811
Lost toys, anti-baby activists.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.564
-Ah! A classic puzzler.
-[drawer bangs]

03:51.648 --> 03:55.276
Grumpy Baby Grump-Grump,
the baby who will not smile.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.030
He doesn't smile for pictures.
He doesn't laugh from tickles.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.450
He sits in the yard all day
and just growls.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.619
-[weak growl]
-A tragic case.

04:04.953 --> 04:09.832
Likes gummy duckies, pat-a-cake.
Dislikes noise, big sister. That's it.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.336
About as helpful as handlebars on oatmeal.
Let's pay him a visit.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.172
-Okay, Grump-Grump.
-[growls]

04:17.590 --> 04:19.300
We need to get you laughing again.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.970
So allow me to present a comedy joke.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.264
He's a baby. They don't understand jokes.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.848
This one has a physical punchline,

04:25.932 --> 04:29.269
therefore a high-yield laughter rate
in babies three to 14 months.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.603
Ahem.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.356
-What do you call a-- ow!
-[laughing]

04:33.439 --> 04:35.400
-Templeton!
-That's funny.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.360
-It's-- oh!
-[laughing]

04:38.319 --> 04:41.739
-[grunts] It's not working, Templeton.
-[growls]

04:41.823 --> 04:44.575
If that didn't make him laugh,
nothing will.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.245
Ah, but you didn't let me finish  my  joke.

04:47.870 --> 04:48.830
Ahem.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.166
What do you call "a low-flying waterfowl"?

04:53.251 --> 04:54.085
Duck!

04:56.296 --> 04:57.547
Too intellectual. Noted.

04:57.880 --> 04:58.923
-Ooh!
-[laughing]

04:59.007 --> 05:01.217
-[Boss Baby] Templeton!
-[growls]

05:01.926 --> 05:04.554
"Smash the box"?
That doesn't mean anything.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.972
Or does it mean everything?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.850
Unbox yourself, brain. Gah! [sighs]

05:08.933 --> 05:11.978
Gigi's coming to get you
for a family meeting. Look innocent.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.606
You really don't have to do this, Gigi.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.483
Summer's over before you know it.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.570
I can't go without leaving this family
with one final gift.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.031
A fully potty-trained baby.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.659
-Potty training is the worst.
-Don't you think he's too young?

05:26.743 --> 05:29.996
I potty-trained Ted at this age,
and he turned out great.

05:30.330 --> 05:35.251
-[chuckles] I'm the Pineapple Pro-feth-or!
-[laughing]

05:35.626 --> 05:38.129
Pineapples contain the protein bromelain,

05:38.212 --> 05:40.089
great for tenderizing meat.

05:40.381 --> 05:43.134
-I don't know.
-No, that's really true about pineapples.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.554
-The potty training, Ted.
-Well, might be nice.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.931
Remember how hard it was
to potty-train Tim?

05:49.599 --> 05:53.144
So much. Everywhere.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.899
-All right, if you think you can.
-Oh, I guarantee it.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.817
Got a family method
from the old country.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.612
It puts the baby
in total control of the process.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.030
Just you watch.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.074
[grunts]

06:06.157 --> 06:08.534
It's me, Templeton. As you were.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.037
As I was what? Agh!

06:11.412 --> 06:14.290
-Oh, don't mind me. Please continue.
-Jeez!

06:14.457 --> 06:16.125
Put on some-- anything.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.086
No can do, Tim-a-roo.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.589
Gigi's got me on a system.
"The Naked Baby Potty Technique."

06:21.672 --> 06:23.508
How does being naked help?

06:23.841 --> 06:26.177
I set up potty chairs all over the house.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.762
No need for help from grownups.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.181
That way, when it's time for baby to go...

06:30.515 --> 06:34.477
I just crawl over to the nearest potty
and achieve my major milestone.

06:34.894 --> 06:35.770
[thumps]

06:37.480 --> 06:39.023
Something bothering you?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.025
-You're naked.
-No, I'm not.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.861
I'm not looking again to prove it,
but, yes, you are.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.240
Baby nudity doesn't count.
Totally different from regular nudity.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.576
Your naked butt
is still gonna get all over everything.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.080
[chuckles] Yeah.
But we have bigger fish to fry.

06:54.163 --> 06:57.750
I've gotta knock out these Lonesome Files
if I want Turtleneck to notice.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.169
Here, just put this on
while you're around me.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.087
Pass.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.005
Honestly, I've never felt so relaxed.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.549
I thought you loved diapers.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.301
Who doesn't? But I owe Gigi one.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.388
She bought the Plushythingy toy
when Mom and Dad failed me.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.808
So I put on a little pee-pee pony show,
Gigi looks like a hero,

07:13.891 --> 07:16.811
and when she goes back home,
a few well-timed "accidents,"

07:16.894 --> 07:18.771
I'll be in diapers in a hot second.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.399
I love that you and Gigi
are finally getting along.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.570
But you know what I'd also love?
If your butt wasn't all over everything.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.573
Don't make this about you.
You better hope that's clean.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.868
I am not looking at a naked baby butt.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.286
[sniffs] And I checked.

07:33.744 --> 07:37.373
Wait. If this is for Gigi,
can't you just go on the potty right now?

07:37.457 --> 07:38.624
Presentation.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.336
Gigi needs to feel like she's earned this.
I'll go before bedtime tonight.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.630
Promise? [gasps, retches]

07:44.839 --> 07:48.468
-What?
-Your naked butt is on my Football Mike!

07:51.596 --> 07:55.516
How dare you?
This man was a hero in the football wars.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.728
Ahhh.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.271
All right, Baby Grump-Grump,

08:00.354 --> 08:02.648
let's take a look at you with fresh eyes.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.734
[humming]

08:06.152 --> 08:06.986
Whoa!

08:07.069 --> 08:09.489
Likes gummy duckies, hates noise,
eating gummy duckies,

08:09.572 --> 08:12.158

pat-a-cake player, strong claps,

08:12.241 --> 08:15.244
powerful slaps, too much noise--
Everything makes sense!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.955
[yells] I'm coming,
Grumpy Baby Grump-Grump!

08:18.706 --> 08:20.416

08:21.626 --> 08:23.127
[growls]

08:24.045 --> 08:24.879
Eh...?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.215
Hey, Boss. How goes it?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.217
Free and easy, Jimbee-bo.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.136
So, did you really just call us for this?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.388
Yes. And to witness.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.518
Big sister was making a lot of noise,
so you covered your ears, didn't you?

08:38.601 --> 08:42.396
But you had a fistful of gummy duckies.
With pat-a-cake-strengthened hands,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.316
ducky got shoved all the way down into...

-Don't feel so grumpy now, do you?

08:53.032 --> 08:55.201
[gasps] You solved
Grumpy Baby Grump-Grump?

08:55.451 --> 08:57.161
-How?
-I don't know.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.331
-The answer just came to me.
-[man] The baby is laughing!

09:00.998 --> 09:04.460
Honey, the baby is laughing!

09:04.544 --> 09:05.836
[chuckles]

09:05.920 --> 09:09.048
Three hours and nothing?
What kinda bladder you got, kid?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.091
[babbling]

09:10.174 --> 09:12.760
You're right.
It'll happen when it happens.

09:14.971 --> 09:15.805
[panting]

09:17.098 --> 09:19.600
-[sighs] Oh, sweet relief.
-[Gigi] Forgot my book.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.018
[cooing]

09:21.227 --> 09:22.853
I know you can do this.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.773
Oh, mama mercy!

09:27.066 --> 09:28.192
Come on.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.528
Tip-top Timbo. Just the kid I need.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.489
Let's mosey office way
and wrangle some Lonesome Files.

09:34.865 --> 09:35.741
I want to help.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.121
I really, really do.
But I can't keep looking at baby butt.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.080
Your call.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.748
But whenever I'm not around,

09:42.832 --> 09:46.460
all I can think about is how much
of my stuff your naked butt is on.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.462
-[gasps] My comic!
-Hmm?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.590
Whoop. Might be a cheek mark
on the cover.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.591
Agh!

09:51.674 --> 09:55.595
I'm gonna smash the box today, Templeton.
You coming to the office or not?

09:55.678 --> 09:58.514
[growls] I don't know which is worse!

09:58.598 --> 09:59.432

10:00.141 --> 10:03.811
Yes, I  am  coming with you to the office.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.354
[chuckles]

10:05.688 --> 10:06.939
Remember you talked about

10:07.023 --> 10:09.775
how inventive you can be
when you're "sick of something"?

10:10.151 --> 10:13.446
Uh, this is ludicrous! I must build it.

-Negative.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.589
Oh, yeah. Hey, good look on you, Beebs.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.216
Baby nudity, Templeton. Doesn't count.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.385
-Boss Baby. I need an opinion.
-[yelps]

10:36.469 --> 10:38.137
I'm pushing a disruption focus

10:38.220 --> 10:40.931
leaping further forward
to our technological destiny.

10:41.015 --> 10:41.849
Thoughts?

10:42.141 --> 10:45.394
Clean the slate, become the customer
and feel the unspoken need.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.607
Redundancies will sink. Whatever floats,
we harness to redefine that need.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.360
-Protracted rollout?
-Trickle-up culture shift.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.695
I never thought of it that way. Thank you.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.408
-You understood her?
-I over-stood her.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.786
She's never been so clear to me.
Could it be...

11:01.869 --> 11:04.121
-Wait.
-...that not wearing any clothes...

11:04.205 --> 11:06.207
-Not the reason.
-...makes me a genius?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.792
No. That's dumb.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.252
My clothes were a box,
and I've smashed it!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.462
I'm set free.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.756
I'm a naked baby genius!

11:15.174 --> 11:17.426
You were plenty smart
with pants on, you know.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.262
I've organized the files
into three categories.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.973
Easy, Hard...

11:23.391 --> 11:26.102
and Only Naked Baby Genius
Can Figure These Out.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.605
I'm pretty sure Pants-On Baby Genius
could solve them faster.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.317
Gotta get through these cases, Templeton.
After that, who knows?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.070
With these results,
why wear pants ever again?

11:36.153 --> 11:38.364
You promised
you'd go on the potty tonight.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.573
I promised nothing.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.701
Gigi's training is baby-led, right?
Baby's not ready.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.871
Please, these things
are making me cross-eyed. Agh!

11:46.205 --> 11:47.706
Baby butt! I need those glasses.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.335
Agh! Baby butt! Agh!

11:51.419 --> 11:54.255
-What's his problem?
-I'm not wearing any clothes.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.967
Huh. I honestly did not even notice.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.263
Oh, "naked baby genius." I get that now.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.684
Simmons, I'm absolutely sick and tired
of my brother's naked butt.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.601
Whoa!

12:07.685 --> 12:10.312
A trivial problem almost nobody
would care about.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.398
You must have a zillion ideas.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.607
Let's get to work.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.819
I found optimized cases
for each of your strengths

12:16.902 --> 12:20.656
using an algorithm I was able to develop
in five minutes because I'm naked.

12:21.198 --> 12:25.035
The accounting department is missing cash?
Sounds like math.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.956
You sure this job is for me?
Jimbo? We've met before.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.126
Remember a few years back
when the company tried keeping money

12:32.209 --> 12:34.295
in teddy bears instead of banks?

12:34.378 --> 12:35.629
What could go wrong?

12:36.547 --> 12:37.798
Oh...

12:37.882 --> 12:41.260
Hug every teddy bear in Baby Corp,
and when you find a crunchy one,

12:41.343 --> 12:43.721
dollars to donuts there'll be cash inside.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.308
Yay! Teddy hugs! Best job ever!

12:47.391 --> 12:51.729
Uh, you're giving  me  the problem file
from human resources?

"Worker Baby Amal took Worker Baby Peg's

How is this my strength?

12:59.153 --> 13:02.448
I ran the numbers.
The only solution is violence.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.365
Yes!

13:06.368 --> 13:08.162
Hey, baby brother. Listen.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.664
I'm really sorry
about my freak-out earlier.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.916
I get it. You're a prude.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.210
-Let's move past your hang-ups.
-Let's.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.920
I brought an extra-comfy chair

13:16.003 --> 13:19.340
to help you get even more relaxed
and even smarter.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.341

13:26.222 --> 13:27.848
If you won't do it, then I will.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.517
Then this is  war.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.937

20:45.953 --> 20:48.372
Any kind of liquid
can help me solve this puzzle.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.459
So, it's come to this.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.004
All right, Stubenhaus.
Here comes "any liquid."

20:56.296 --> 20:57.381
[grunts]

20:57.756 --> 21:00.467
Don't worry, Gigi.
This is definitely going to work.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.302
Where did you get that potty chair?

21:02.386 --> 21:05.097
Uh, Danny Petrosky's uncle works
in a baby research lab.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.432
That seems reasonable
because it's the truth.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.477
[Oopsie Baby chimes]
Hooray! Baby went potty.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.146
-Well, I'll be.
-I'll go make sure.

21:13.855 --> 21:17.359
Come on, Stinkless Serum formula.
Your secrets are mine, Stubenhaus.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.277
[laughing]

21:18.902 --> 21:20.612
Wait, it's not decoding.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.281
It's dissolving. No!

21:22.614 --> 21:25.951
-Stubenhaus' file dissolved? Gotcha.
-What did you say to me?

21:26.034 --> 21:29.705
Yep, Gigi, he really did go.
So you can bring him some dang pants.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.792
Pants on, naked. Smart, fooled. Boom!

21:33.875 --> 21:36.461
-[Oopsie Baby]  Oopsie! Oopsie!
-Oh.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.136
Baby, what did you eat?

21:46.096 --> 21:47.055
[Tim] Huh.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.140
Guess you were right.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.934
One accident, you're back in diapers
in a hot second.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.603
I did miss the comfort and containment.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.273
You really smashed the box
with that paper trick.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
And Stubenhaus, too.
He was quite the genius.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.653
Pfft! Stubenhaus was a terrible scientist.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.574
Simmons just likes his dumb sayings.
That secret code was all me.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.076
I got the idea
when Simmons was demonstrating paper

22:08.160 --> 22:10.203
that only dissolves in liquids
that aren't water.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.456
Why would anyone need--?
Right, Simmons.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.082
Useless invention. Carry on.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.625
[Tim]  I just doodled on it.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.504
I planted the file
where I knew someone would find it.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.966
Then I trapped you on the toilet
with one option. Tinkle, tinkle, boom,

22:23.050 --> 22:27.304
-you're wearing pants again.
-Outsmarted by a kid in denim short pants.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.514
Farewell, naked baby genius.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.184
-He had a good run. Night.
-Night.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.022
[Tim] While you were gone,
I put my naked butt on your pillow.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.608
-[Boss Baby] Agh!
-[Tim chuckles]
