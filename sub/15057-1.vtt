03:53.532 --> 03:56.609
At the next intersection,
why don't you turn south?

03:56.749 --> 04:00.341
Chocolate Mountains were east
last time we headed that way.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.580
Who needs the mountains?
Head for San Felipe.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.101
There's nothing to do
in San Felipe but fish.

04:06.201 --> 04:07.547
Well...

04:08.133 --> 04:10.448
That was the idea, wasn't it?

04:11.349 --> 04:13.625
Yeah, I guess so.

04:14.465 --> 04:18.283
We might just pick up a drink in Mexicale.

04:18.382 --> 04:22.780
- Remember Floribel at the Alhambra Club?
- Yeah.

04:23.197 --> 04:26.171
She's probably dead by now.
It was a long time ago.

04:26.271 --> 04:29.371
Yeah. Poor old Floribel.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.691
Well, there's no harm
in drinking a toast to her.

04:32.791 --> 04:33.991
Well, okay.

04:37.061 --> 04:41.551
Except for the war, this is my first time
away from Maudie and the kids.

04:41.651 --> 04:46.467
- D'you wanna turn back?
- No, no. We've come this far.

04:46.567 --> 04:49.405
Mexicale's beginning to sound good.

04:58.593 --> 05:00.435
Guess maybes.

05:03.869 --> 05:06.274
I remember that joint.

05:35.933 --> 05:39.267
Bienvenidos, caballeros!
Bienvenidos a Mexico...

05:39.367 --> 05:41.462
This is the place, señores, come in.

05:41.562 --> 05:45.301
Juanita's starting her famous fan dance.
You're just in time.

05:45.401 --> 05:49.352
We might as well take a look.
Hey, Gil! Gil?

05:51.930 --> 05:54.490
Sorry, friend, no sale.

06:01.557 --> 06:05.038
Oh, well. San Felipe, here we come.

06:24.154 --> 06:25.593
- Out of gas?
- Yeah.

06:25.693 --> 06:27.163
Hop in.

06:35.041 --> 06:38.750
We're going to San Felipe, you can
pick up gas there and hitch a ride back.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.924
- Waiting out there long?
- Yeah.

06:46.783 --> 06:49.627
Light me a cigarette.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.579
Smoke?

06:55.818 --> 06:57.576
No.

06:58.716 --> 07:01.238
What are you doing, rolling 'em?

07:03.186 --> 07:05.234
Face front.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.158
And keep driving.

07:10.754 --> 07:13.234
Sure, I'm Emmet Myers.

07:14.111 --> 07:16.251
Do what I tell you, and no fast moves.

07:16.351 --> 07:19.351
A lot of dead heroes back there got nervous.

07:23.263 --> 07:26.156
From now on, when you're driving,
keep both hands high on that wheel.

07:26.256 --> 07:29.033
You, keep one hand on the top of this seat,

07:30.123 --> 07:32.920
the other hand high on that window.

07:34.110 --> 07:38.715
All right. Now turn off
the next side road we come to.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.832
Pull up.

07:56.641 --> 07:59.026
Open the glove compartment.

08:04.185 --> 08:05.701
What's the box?

08:05.911 --> 08:08.595
- Cartridges, 22s.
- Give 'em to me.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.928
Close it.

08:19.773 --> 08:22.700
Now this is how we get out, after this.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.700
First, give me the keys.

08:28.101 --> 08:30.702
Now we oughta
get out the same side, this one.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.845
I get out first, then you.

08:32.945 --> 08:36.565
Stand away from the car. And then you.

08:37.053 --> 08:38.957
Let's go.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.468
Drop your jackets around your elbows.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.356
Turn around.

09:02.211 --> 09:05.710
We're gonna open the trunk. Move.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.012
Pull your jackets up.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.745
You, open the trunk.

09:18.855 --> 09:21.335
Both of you, keep your hands on the lid.

09:24.987 --> 09:26.863
Throw me the keys.

09:27.803 --> 09:29.480
Now get the blankets.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.496
You'd never make it!

09:33.797 --> 09:35.997
Get the groceries, you.

09:39.609 --> 09:41.705
- Whose gun is that?
- Mine.

09:41.805 --> 09:44.505
- Do you like to shoot?
- Yeah.

09:44.644 --> 09:49.517
So do I. So I'm warning you,
don't try anything smart with me.

09:49.617 --> 09:51.599
Move!

10:35.430 --> 10:37.461
I told you my name. What's yours?

10:37.561 --> 10:42.314
Mine's Gilbert Bowen. He's Roy Collins.

10:42.414 --> 10:44.492
What do you do for a living?

10:44.592 --> 10:48.148
I'm a draughtsman. He runs a garage.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.364
That makes you smarter.

10:50.464 --> 10:52.790
Or does it?

10:56.120 --> 11:00.320
You're lucky. It hit an empty chamber.
I used it a while back.

11:00.431 --> 11:04.748
No fast moves!
The last guy made that mistake.

11:34.032 --> 11:36.309
When are you due back?

11:36.749 --> 11:39.141
No particular time.

11:39.842 --> 11:42.542
We told our wives to expect us home
when we got there.

11:42.781 --> 11:46.060
You got wives, huh? Any kids?

11:46.599 --> 11:48.172
I have.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.472
Just keep thinking how nice
it'll be to see 'em again.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.603
There's a checkpoint.
Slow down. No talking.

11:59.703 --> 12:02.282
If I give you the word, step on it.

12:31.947 --> 12:34.283
This car rides pretty good.

12:34.823 --> 12:37.590
When I get where I'm going,
I think I'll sell it.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.447
Where are we going?

12:41.762 --> 12:45.676
Pull in at the next pump.
We'll fill up and get a road map.

12:46.116 --> 12:48.152
I got an idea.

12:48.342 --> 12:51.066
A pretty good one.

13:10.149 --> 13:11.767
- Aquí estás, señor.
- Gracias.

13:11.867 --> 13:14.522
- Speak English, you.
- He doesn't understand English.

13:14.622 --> 13:16.023
I don't understand Mexican.

13:16.123 --> 13:18.123
Never mind the change, let's get out of here.

13:23.657 --> 13:24.961
Loco!

13:28.966 --> 13:30.785
Gimme the map.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.763
Take the first side road we come to.

14:07.398 --> 14:09.105
Pull up.

14:12.692 --> 14:14.589
Keys.

14:15.429 --> 14:18.651
All right, now get out like I told you.

14:23.683 --> 14:28.004
Here, you're the smart guy.
Spread the map out on the hood.

14:32.351 --> 14:36.702
Get your hands up on the car.
Look for a town called Santa Rosalia.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.296
How far is it?

14:42.736 --> 14:45.329
- About 500 miles.
- Is it on the Gulf of California?

14:45.429 --> 14:49.329
- Yeah.
- Say anything about a ferry across the Gulf?

14:49.968 --> 14:51.452
Friday.

14:52.248 --> 14:54.284
Not bad.

14:55.124 --> 14:57.421
We're loaded with time.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.157
We can make that easy.

15:04.192 --> 15:07.435
After that, I won't need you guys any more.

15:10.846 --> 15:13.458
I guess we won't be having rabbit for dinner.

15:13.798 --> 15:15.943
I wasn't trying.

15:23.371 --> 15:24.524
Collins.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.648
Put the can on that rock there.

15:31.377 --> 15:33.677
Gimme the map.

15:41.168 --> 15:44.831
Not that one! The other one.

15:46.147 --> 15:48.653
That's it.

15:51.093 --> 15:53.792
All right, Collins.
Put the can back on the rock.

15:59.834 --> 16:05.636
Don't forget, this is loaded too.
You try. Let's see how good you are.

16:11.479 --> 16:13.595
Go ahead.

16:19.553 --> 16:21.991
Not bad.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.045
Collins.

16:24.285 --> 16:26.611
Pick up the can.

16:28.939 --> 16:31.575
Take it onto that point there.

16:31.815 --> 16:34.610
If you don't, I'll let Bowen have it.

16:34.710 --> 16:37.206
Onto the point, that's right.

16:38.246 --> 16:40.492
Further.

16:44.421 --> 16:49.294
Now hold it up. You won't get hurt,
your buddy's good with guns.

16:50.334 --> 16:54.752
- You're crazy! I won't do it.
- It's just a game. Go ahead.

16:54.852 --> 16:57.933
Collins, hold it closer to you.

16:58.594 --> 17:03.197
What's the matter, are you scared?
Hold it closer.

17:03.437 --> 17:06.464
You want me to try?
I might miss this time.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.491
Shoot.

17:41.074 --> 17:43.418
Come on Gil, get going.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.180
Nervous? Relax.

17:54.036 --> 17:56.674
All right, Collins, come on in.

17:56.774 --> 17:58.056
Fun's over.

18:01.431 --> 18:04.514
You guys worked up quite a sweat.

18:28.376 --> 18:29.934
Collins.

18:31.794 --> 18:34.524
- Collins!
- What do you want?

18:34.624 --> 18:36.963
- Turn on the radio.
- Why bother?

18:37.063 --> 18:41.983
- All you get is Mexican commercials.
- Never mind. Turn it on.

18:50.952 --> 18:53.947
- Get something else.
- Like what?

18:54.047 --> 18:57.247
One of those news guys from the States.

19:01.755 --> 19:05.092
Scheduled for 10am at the White House.

19:05.192 --> 19:09.687
On the crime front, the police of 9 western
states, from Washington in the north

19:09.787 --> 19:11.626
to Colorado and Utah in the east,

19:11.726 --> 19:13.980
have been alerted to keep a continue search

19:14.080 --> 19:16.880
for Kansas desperado, Emmet Myers.

19:17.119 --> 19:21.777
Reports have placed the killer in Florida,
Detroit and Seattle,

19:21.877 --> 19:26.825
although the police have discounted
most of these. His latest victim,

19:26.925 --> 19:30.597
William Johnson, a salesman
from Portland, Oregon,

19:30.697 --> 19:34.336
was found late yesterday
in Imperial County, California.

19:34.436 --> 19:38.712
The victim's car, possibly with Myers
in it, has not yet been found.

19:38.812 --> 19:42.914
- The United Nations...
- Shut it off.

19:44.906 --> 19:47.400
They're not even close!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.918
You guys don't have to worry.

19:50.018 --> 19:52.015
Not yet.

19:52.255 --> 19:55.739
You can start sweating
when they put me in this car...

19:55.839 --> 19:57.939
If they ever do.

20:01.686 --> 20:05.361
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
Sam Hayes reporting.

20:05.461 --> 20:07.300
At the top of the news tonight
there's a report

20:07.400 --> 20:10.049
that Hitch-hike murderer,
Emmet Myers, is still at large.

20:10.149 --> 20:12.049
Yesterday, the devil thumbed another ride

20:12.149 --> 20:17.018
and William Johnson of Portland
asked him to hop in. Now, he is dead.

20:17.118 --> 20:18.962
In an all-out effort to apprehend Myers,

20:19.062 --> 20:22.337
the police have set up roadblocks
on all major highways of the western states,

20:22.437 --> 20:24.976
and all border stations
are being closely watched.

20:25.076 --> 20:29.011
Myers is slight, 28 years of age,
is wearing a dark shirt,

20:29.111 --> 20:31.950
dark grey trousers
and a black leather jacket.

20:32.050 --> 20:33.882
His right eyelid is partially paralysed.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.083
If you are in possession of any information

20:36.183 --> 20:38.221
regarding the whereabouts of this individual,

20:38.321 --> 20:40.555
please communicate
with your nearest office of police

20:40.655 --> 20:43.855
or office of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.269
Pull up.

21:01.532 --> 21:03.056
Keys.

21:06.927 --> 21:08.417
Out.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.421
Move.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.581
Each of you take one.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.617
Get around the car.

21:41.027 --> 21:43.632
We'll camp here tonight.

21:53.681 --> 21:56.216
I know what you're thinking, Collins.

21:56.456 --> 21:59.101
You haven't got a chance.

22:01.090 --> 22:06.267
You guys are gonna die, that's all.
It's just a question of when.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.908
Santa Rosalia, that's the end of the line.

22:11.148 --> 22:14.296
If the cops find out we're together

22:14.636 --> 22:17.515
or if you try to cross me up...

22:24.187 --> 22:29.368
You know, you make
pretty good targets from where I sit.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.554
Anyway, you couldn't tell
if I was awake or asleep.

22:35.489 --> 22:38.001
I've one bum eye.

22:38.101 --> 22:40.943
It won't stay closed.

22:41.283 --> 22:43.789
Pretty good, huh?

23:48.542 --> 23:51.039
We're getting out here and buy some grub.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.078
We get out of the car like usual.

23:53.178 --> 23:55.692
You guys go in the store ahead of me.

23:55.792 --> 23:58.531
No Mexican. I'm talking to you.

23:58.631 --> 24:02.447
When he tells you how much, you pay.
Is that clear?

24:02.547 --> 24:05.722
One other thing.
I'll have my hand in my pocket.

24:05.822 --> 24:09.557
So far, my record in Mexico's clean,
I wanna keep it that way.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.467
Let's go.

24:19.027 --> 24:21.227
Buenos días, señores.

24:35.546 --> 24:37.805
Buenos días, señores. Provisiones?

24:37.905 --> 24:41.481
Tengo un gran surtido de frutas y legumbres

24:41.581 --> 24:43.455
al mismo precio que existen en Tijuana.

24:43.555 --> 24:44.956
What did he say about Tijuana?

24:45.056 --> 24:47.994
He says their prices
are about the same as in Tijuana.

24:48.094 --> 24:50.571
Never mind the kid.

24:52.011 --> 24:54.550
- What do you want?
- Some beans and stuff.

24:54.650 --> 24:57.550
And tomato soup. I like that.
Get four cans.

24:58.088 --> 25:02.816
He wants four cans of beans
and tomato soup, three cans of chilli.

25:03.397 --> 25:05.649
It's no use. He doesn't
understand English.

25:05.749 --> 25:10.649
You're not talking Mexican. Take
the cans. Give them to Collins.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.808
I can take some more.

25:32.141 --> 25:34.330
Go on, load it up.

25:35.997 --> 25:38.716
That'll hold us. Pay him.

25:39.935 --> 25:43.591
Quince pesos, diez centavos, señor.

25:51.314 --> 25:54.834
Dame una manzana. Dame una manzana.

25:54.934 --> 25:57.436
Dame una manzana.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.672
Get her away from me.

26:04.642 --> 26:07.296
Put the kid down. Let's get
outta here. Come on, Collins.

26:07.396 --> 26:10.496
Hasta luego señores. Muchas gracias.

26:14.191 --> 26:16.464
Vaya usted con Dios.

26:16.604 --> 26:18.943
- What did you say to her?
- You wouldn't understand.

26:19.043 --> 26:21.343
What did you say to her?

26:22.882 --> 26:25.843
I said, "Go you with God, little one".

26:43.278 --> 26:45.114
Get in.

26:47.011 --> 26:48.409
Hey, mister.

26:48.509 --> 26:53.350
You live in El Centro. I live there
some time. Nice place, huh?

28:05.003 --> 28:07.339
Where'd you get the watch, Bowen?

28:08.279 --> 28:10.282
My wife gave it to me.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.295
Throw it over here.

28:16.762 --> 28:20.624
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to throw it over here.

28:38.258 --> 28:42.254
I had a watch like this once, when I was 17.

28:43.594 --> 28:45.571
Nobody gave it to me.

28:45.671 --> 28:47.387
I took it.

28:47.487 --> 28:52.523
I knocked off a broken-down
jewellery store outside of Tulsa.

28:53.863 --> 28:55.884
It was a cinch.

28:57.224 --> 28:59.872
You guys are soft.

29:02.888 --> 29:05.385
You know what makes you that way?

29:06.425 --> 29:09.102
You're up to your necks in IOUs.

29:10.442 --> 29:12.980
You're suckers.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.944
You're scared to get out on your own.

29:16.044 --> 29:19.099
You always had it good, so you're soft.

29:20.838 --> 29:22.965
Well, not me.

29:24.022 --> 29:26.518
Nobody ever gave me anything.

29:26.618 --> 29:29.297
So I don't owe nobody.

29:31.035 --> 29:33.732
My folks were duff.

29:33.832 --> 29:36.487
When I was born,
they took one look at this...

29:36.587 --> 29:39.526
puss of mine and told me to get lost.

29:39.626 --> 29:43.729
I didn't need 'em.
I didn't need any of em.

29:44.169 --> 29:47.355
I got what I wanted my own way.

29:48.895 --> 29:51.913
When you get the know-how
and a few bucks in your pocket,

29:52.013 --> 29:55.913
you can buy anything or... anybody.

29:56.809 --> 30:02.349
Especially if they're at the point
of a gun. That really scares 'em.

30:03.021 --> 30:05.794
You ever been at the other end of a gun?

30:06.195 --> 30:09.695
No. And I never will be.

30:13.485 --> 30:16.288
I'm gonna listen to the news.

30:32.286 --> 30:34.483
Turn it up.
We'd like to hear what's going on.

30:34.583 --> 30:39.683
You just get the grub ready.
Anything interesting, I'll let you know.

30:41.312 --> 30:45.666
We've got to raise the hood
and put that radio out of commission.

30:46.306 --> 30:49.203
When he finds out they're looking
for us together, we're through.

30:49.303 --> 30:54.676
- Never mind the radio. We gotta get him.
- You can't beat him that way.

30:54.776 --> 30:57.370
Give him one good reason and he'll kill us.

30:57.470 --> 30:59.009
We gotta take the chance.

30:59.109 --> 31:02.742
As long as he needs us, we'll stay alive.

31:02.843 --> 31:06.378
When he's ready to jump us,
we'll jump him. Not before.

31:06.478 --> 31:08.900
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

31:11.340 --> 31:13.525
All right, now.

31:14.830 --> 31:17.474
They've found Johnson's car.

31:22.269 --> 31:24.767
They know I'm in Mexico.

31:25.716 --> 31:30.432
And they're looking for you, too,
in the Chocolate Mountains.

31:31.072 --> 31:33.493
Where are the Chocolate Mountains?

31:34.568 --> 31:37.014
- In Arizona, near home.
- Not in Mexico?

31:37.114 --> 31:38.635
No.

31:41.061 --> 31:43.647
Well, what d'you know?

31:44.963 --> 31:47.787
That's where you told your wives
you were going, uh?

31:47.988 --> 31:50.588
Then you came to Mexico.

31:51.966 --> 31:54.083
What for?

31:54.723 --> 31:56.121
Dames?

31:57.761 --> 32:00.778
You boys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

32:00.878 --> 32:04.774
Causing all that trouble, telling lies.

32:05.932 --> 32:10.087
You've got everybody looking
for you in them mountains.

32:22.710 --> 32:25.728
- I told you, turn the radio on.
- I did.

32:25.868 --> 32:28.422
It takes time to warm up.

32:29.839 --> 32:32.112
Try another station.

32:35.393 --> 32:38.673
- Stop it. Stop it!
- I can't. I gotta pull up and disconnect it.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.767
Then pull up!

32:52.715 --> 32:56.263
Come on, raise the hood.
And keep your hands on it.

32:59.308 --> 33:01.626
Come on, Collins, get to work.

33:01.726 --> 33:04.164
Get the right one the first time.

33:05.903 --> 33:08.224
Don't pull the radio wire!

33:16.227 --> 33:18.390
Faster, faster!
I thought you were a mechanic.

33:18.490 --> 33:21.283
I'm going as fast as I can.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.686
Watch it.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.849
Come on.

33:58.634 --> 34:01.158
Throw the tools in the back.

34:16.496 --> 34:19.475
The radio, remember? Make it work.

34:22.947 --> 34:25.014
I can't.

34:26.721 --> 34:28.525
Pull up.

34:30.177 --> 34:33.123
So you did bust it, Collins.

34:34.370 --> 34:38.166
Cut it out! He didn't do it.
It's the static in the hills.

34:38.266 --> 34:40.726
The stations aren't strong enough
in the daytime, tonight it'll work.

34:40.826 --> 34:44.426
Tonight it'd better. Take the wheel.

34:46.697 --> 34:49.775
Now, in Punta Prieta,

34:49.875 --> 34:52.675
in August 7th, three Americans stopped

34:52.775 --> 34:56.514
for provisions at a store
owned by José Andrade.

34:56.614 --> 35:00.881
Andrade gave a description of Myers
as being one of them.

35:00.981 --> 35:04.475
Another witness stated
that three men left the store

35:04.575 --> 35:08.650
and drove away in a green sedan
bearing the same plates.

35:08.750 --> 35:12.186
This confirms our theory that Collins
and Bowen are with him.

35:12.286 --> 35:16.125
He seems to be heading south,
staying clear of main highways.

35:16.225 --> 35:19.815
Exactly. To the west,
this is more or less barren

35:19.915 --> 35:22.254
and would afford no means of escape.

35:22.354 --> 35:27.690
His most logical move would be Santa Rosalia.

35:27.930 --> 35:31.573
Then Guaymas.

35:32.401 --> 35:36.863
Make sure that fire's out.
Pour the coffee on it.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.618
Get down!

35:49.841 --> 35:53.417
I've gotta get a closer look at that car.
On your feet.

35:53.557 --> 35:57.795
Through there.
At the other end, lie flat. Get going!

36:32.194 --> 36:35.487
- Get a move on!
- Are you trying to wreck it?

36:35.587 --> 36:37.587
Drive like I tell you.

36:57.411 --> 36:59.397
Out!

37:03.153 --> 37:08.269
- What did I tell you?
- Shut up! Get that spare tyre out. Move!

37:27.405 --> 37:31.725
Keep working. Keep your traps shut,
no matter what. I'll be watching.

37:44.171 --> 37:46.206
Buenos días, señores.

37:46.306 --> 37:50.006
Son Americanos? Do you need any help?

37:50.707 --> 37:55.007
Que raro, no me contestan. Bueno, vámos!

38:00.469 --> 38:02.762
The search for Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins,

38:02.862 --> 38:06.400
believed to have been last seen
with Emmet Myers, mass killer,

38:06.500 --> 38:08.689
is being stepped up by the hour.

38:08.789 --> 38:11.790
Helicopters are working in shifts,
scouring the entire area

38:11.890 --> 38:14.728
from El Centro south
to the Gulf of California.

38:14.828 --> 38:17.562
The planes are maintaining
close liaison with the ground,

38:17.662 --> 38:20.101
reporting isolated cars and campers.

38:20.201 --> 38:24.945
The Mexican police have now joined
this strange race against death.

40:41.295 --> 40:43.480
Hold it right there.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.318
Around.

40:59.194 --> 41:01.374
Break the lock.

41:23.743 --> 41:26.568
Okay, one of you on the pump.

42:14.386 --> 42:19.265
"Maudie and Gilbert Bowen".

42:19.566 --> 42:23.266
Mayo 12 del '41.

42:23.631 --> 42:26.328
Sí, sí, pronto.

42:26.868 --> 42:30.994
Now, as you will notice,
when interrogated at the road block,

42:31.094 --> 42:33.538
the man and his wife
were very definite in their statement

42:33.638 --> 42:37.577
that they only saw two men.
This was below El Arco.

42:37.677 --> 42:40.714
There is a point, however,
which we feel is of importance.

42:40.814 --> 42:44.346
The couple stated that the behaviour
of the men seemed strange.

42:44.446 --> 42:46.385
That they refused to talk to them.

42:46.485 --> 42:52.001
It's possible that Myers my have
been concealed nearby, covering them.

42:52.101 --> 42:54.150
We'll consider that possibility.

42:54.250 --> 42:57.968
Now, on the assumption that Myers
is listening to the radio,

42:58.068 --> 43:00.207
we're issuing these broadcasts in the state,

43:00.307 --> 43:02.692
containing false information
as to his whereabouts

43:02.792 --> 43:04.793
and not connecting the two men with him.

43:04.893 --> 43:08.693
We'd appreciate your cooperation
and following the same procedure.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.270
- This ought to be the main highway.
- It isn't.

43:28.370 --> 43:31.910
- What do you mean?
- Looks like an abandoned airstrip.

43:32.010 --> 43:35.310
It's okay for tonight. Get over there.

43:43.026 --> 43:46.051
- No, you're wrong, you're wrong!
- It's no use to try to talk me out of it.

43:46.151 --> 43:48.090
- Tonight I'm gonna chance it.
- You're out of your mind!

43:48.190 --> 43:51.165
I've played it your way long enough.
From now on we're each on our own.

43:51.265 --> 43:53.104
It's no good, we've got to stay together.

43:53.204 --> 43:56.269
I've got a break I'm gonna take it,
you do whatever you want...

45:45.141 --> 45:48.089
Across the runway, there's trees.

45:58.678 --> 46:00.685
Keep going!

46:16.078 --> 46:20.715
- You guys are really dumb.
- Why, you dirty...

46:22.709 --> 46:25.326
You thought I was asleep, huh?

46:26.266 --> 46:28.827
You're beginning to get ideas...

46:28.927 --> 46:31.227
I don't like that.

46:31.689 --> 46:33.741
Load him in the car.

46:33.841 --> 46:37.060
Your buddy's all washed up for tonight.

47:17.304 --> 47:19.323
Over there.

47:21.370 --> 47:23.023
Move!

47:36.720 --> 47:40.018
You, Collins, throw a rock down that shaft.

47:52.984 --> 47:55.129
Nice and deep.

48:05.707 --> 48:06.999
This is fine.

48:07.099 --> 48:09.434
Cut it out! If you're gonna kill us,
do it and get it over with.

48:09.534 --> 48:12.138
I thought you never killed without a reason.

48:12.238 --> 48:16.274
Go get the rest of the canned goods
out of the car.

48:16.374 --> 48:19.074
We'll have a real good meal.

48:57.647 --> 49:01.174
Save 'em for the next guy that picks you up.

49:02.946 --> 49:05.185
Anything you say.

49:05.825 --> 49:08.178
We interrupt this hour of music
to bring you a flash bulletin.

49:08.278 --> 49:12.113
The Californian and Mexican police
have abandoned their theory

49:12.213 --> 49:13.907
that Emmet Myers is connected

49:14.007 --> 49:18.111
with the disappearance
of Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins.

49:18.546 --> 49:22.443
They have been missing since last Sunday,
supposedly on a fishing trip.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.797
The police of both sides
of the border now feel

49:24.897 --> 49:26.698
that Myers is travelling alone

49:26.798 --> 49:28.999
and has apparently abandoned his intention

49:29.099 --> 49:33.199
of seeking escape by way of Santa Rosalia.

49:37.128 --> 49:40.035
What d'you know?!

49:40.135 --> 49:43.035
This kind of changes my plans.

49:44.222 --> 49:47.452
Looks like you and me
are going fishing after all.

49:49.571 --> 49:53.211
On your feet. Back to the car. Let's go.

49:54.447 --> 49:56.523
We're not going anyplace.

49:57.663 --> 49:59.427
Stand up!

50:09.166 --> 50:13.556
- What did you do to it?
- There's a big hole in that crankcase.

50:18.599 --> 50:21.623
All right, we'll walk.

50:22.753 --> 50:27.008
Just what that sore ankle of yours needs,
Collins, a nice, long hike.

50:34.172 --> 50:35.956
Get up!

50:40.272 --> 50:43.809
Now get the fishing gear
out of the back. Move!

51:16.534 --> 51:19.379
Stay with it.
He'll never leave you out here alive.

51:19.479 --> 51:22.298
- Yeah.
- Cut the gab.

51:35.190 --> 51:37.097
Get down!

51:46.418 --> 51:48.150
Let's get going.

51:54.307 --> 51:56.610
Maybe we'll have to leave you here.

51:57.111 --> 51:59.211
Too bad.

52:02.956 --> 52:05.277
Come on, Roy, try.

53:03.821 --> 53:07.517
Here we are! Here we are!

53:07.617 --> 53:10.182
Can't you see us?

53:11.214 --> 53:15.368
Look! Here we are! Down here.

53:15.696 --> 53:19.170
Oh, please, God! Hear me!

53:19.270 --> 53:21.530
Hear me!

53:22.020 --> 53:26.118
Come back! Come back.

53:33.745 --> 53:37.809
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's praying?

54:45.339 --> 54:47.483
Get under the bridge, quick!

55:10.071 --> 55:11.989
Relax.

55:33.205 --> 55:36.624
Go ahead if you can stand that filthy stuff.

55:51.704 --> 55:55.777
You know, Collins?
You're just about my size.

55:55.877 --> 55:59.295
Put you in a black shirt and dark pants...

55:59.395 --> 56:01.895
with a leather jacket...

56:02.730 --> 56:05.551
you'd look just like Emmet Myers,

56:05.651 --> 56:08.431
to anyone who never saw him.

56:09.071 --> 56:12.243
And nobody in Santa Rosalia ever saw him.

56:14.074 --> 56:16.040
Let's change.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.808
Get up on the bank and take your clothes off.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.305
Come on, get up!

58:01.947 --> 58:04.883
- Looks great, doesn't it?
- You won't be there long.

58:04.983 --> 58:09.374
Collins! There are cops down there.
In those clothes, they might shoot you.

58:09.714 --> 58:12.531
That'd solve your problems, wouldn't it?

58:12.631 --> 58:15.970
Not if they found they made a mistake.

58:16.070 --> 58:18.963
We'll hit a joint on the outskirts.

58:19.063 --> 58:23.163
I might even buy you boys a beer.
Get moving.

58:30.495 --> 58:34.945
- Buenas tardes, señores.
- Buenas tardes. Give us three beers.

58:35.385 --> 58:37.982
Yo no hablo Inglés.

58:38.722 --> 58:40.656
He doesn't speak English.

58:40.756 --> 58:43.237
- Tres cervezas.
- Sí, sí.

58:43.337 --> 58:46.255
When I want you to talk Mex, I'll tell you.

58:46.355 --> 58:50.255
Sit down, Collins. Rest your sore foot.

58:53.574 --> 58:56.724
You can talk it now.
Ask about the ferry to Guaymas.

58:56.824 --> 59:01.960
I'll be watching his face.
If he looks frightened, I shoot.

59:03.061 --> 59:05.461
Cuándo sale el chalana para Guaymas?

59:06.662 --> 59:09.844
Los martes y viernes a las 9 de la noche

59:09.944 --> 59:12.802
Friday, that's today,
and Tuesday, 9 o'clock.

59:12.902 --> 59:16.667
- Ask him where we catch it.
- Dónde puedo embarcar?

59:16.767 --> 59:19.268
En el muelle.
Pero ahora no pueden embarcarse,

59:19.368 --> 59:23.268
porque el mes pasado se quemó
y lo están reparando en Guaymas.

59:24.786 --> 59:30.643
You're out of luck. The ferry burned up.
It's being repaired in Guaymas.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.876
You're lying.

59:33.416 --> 59:35.395
Ask if he knows anyone who speaks English.

59:35.495 --> 59:39.395
Yo no hablo bien español, no comprendo.

59:40.596 --> 59:42.297
Usted no habla Inglés?

59:42.397 --> 59:46.120
Yo no, pero mi primo José, sí.
Venga conmigo.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.955
He says his cousin speaks English,
follow him.

59:49.055 --> 59:50.152
Up.

59:50.255 --> 59:53.955
José! Levántate, despierta!

59:56.030 --> 59:59.297
- José, José, despierta!
- Que pasó?

59:59.397 --> 01:00:02.097
Estos americanos quieren hablar contigo.

01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:07.998
Los dejo aquí con mi primo.
Si algo necesitan... confianza.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:14.289
What can I do for you?

01:00:14.389 --> 01:00:16.661
We wanna find out about the ferry to Guaymas.

01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:18.961
You wanna go fishing?

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.476
Too bad. No ferry more for
the next two months maybe.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.776
- She burned up.
- Thank you.

01:00:26.015 --> 01:00:31.203
Fishing is good here. Not as good
as Guaymas or La Paz, but okay.

01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:34.581
- You have motor boat?
- You know someone who has a boat?

01:00:34.681 --> 01:00:39.936
Sure, sure. My friend Jaime,
he have one. Motor runs good.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:42.768
- How do we get to this Jaime?
- In the mine, where he works.

01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:45.669
- Let's go.
- He's not finished until six.

01:00:45.769 --> 01:00:49.669
- I'll fix it for you tomorrow morning.
- I wanna go now.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:54.143
- At six, then.
- By the time he gets the boat ready,

01:00:54.243 --> 01:00:56.243
there is no sun.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:01:01.649
My friend does not like using
too much boat at night.

01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:09.281
- He sees his wife and kids only at night.
- Give him some more.

01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:11.179
- For me?
- Yeah.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:13.618
- You pay my friend too?
- Yeah.

01:01:13.758 --> 01:01:18.917
You be at pier at 8.30.
The name of the boat is Estrella.

01:01:20.695 --> 01:01:23.196
A thousand thanks, señor.

01:01:24.886 --> 01:01:26.824
Good.

01:01:28.161 --> 01:01:33.203
We'll go to town and wait
by the water till dark. Let's go.

01:02:09.488 --> 01:02:13.085
- Hold it a minute, will you?
- Hang on.

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:43.875
Better go fishing when you've got the chance.

01:02:43.975 --> 01:02:47.075
That's what you
came down here for, wasn't it?

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:50.988
You guys are really fools.

01:02:52.228 --> 01:02:55.673
If you wanted, one of you
would have got away.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:03:00.888
But you kept thinking about each other.
So you missed some chances.

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:04.551
You got tired. You slowed down.

01:03:05.745 --> 01:03:08.100
Now it's pretty late.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.332
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be in Guaymas.

01:03:12.643 --> 01:03:16.449
Too bad you're not making
the whole trip with me.

01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:20.091
That'd be kinda silly, wouldn't it?

01:03:24.758 --> 01:03:27.395
You stink, Myers!

01:03:27.495 --> 01:03:30.795
You smell. Just like your clothes.

01:03:30.935 --> 01:03:33.410
Sure, you'll get to Guaymas,

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:38.048
but they'll catch up with you
and put you out of your misery.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:42.500
You haven't got a chance.
You haven't got a thing except that gun.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.492
You'd better hang on to it,

01:03:44.592 --> 01:03:46.893
because without it, you're nothing.

01:03:46.993 --> 01:03:50.393
- You're finished!
- Shut up!

01:03:53.368 --> 01:03:55.404
Gracias, Carlos.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:06.794
Caramba!

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:12.349
Pronto! Llame la policía!
Este hombre está en la cantina de mi primo!

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:16.350
Se va esta noche en la estrella!
El barco de mi amigo Jaime!

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:20.150
No Carlos, no estoy borracho!
Llame a la policía!

01:04:21.632 --> 01:04:26.625
Bueno. La policía. No, no, no, la policía!

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.398
Hold it.

01:05:06.959 --> 01:05:11.522
All right, Collins. Now you get
to take a nice walk all by yourself.

01:05:11.622 --> 01:05:15.222
Down the alley and out on the dock.
Me and Bowen will follow.

01:05:15.322 --> 01:05:18.161
If you try to tip anyone off,
I'll let Bowen have it.

01:05:18.261 --> 01:05:22.525
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Get going.

01:06:24.934 --> 01:06:26.815
Go ahead, Collins.

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:30.622
All the way out. Keep under the lights.

01:08:07.063 --> 01:08:10.279
Alto!

01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:12.596
Alto ahí!

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:16.096
I'm not Myers! I'm not Myers!

01:08:16.736 --> 01:08:19.712
D'you hear me? I'm not Myers!

01:08:27.415 --> 01:08:29.819
Alto! Alto!

01:08:35.747 --> 01:08:38.147
Alto! Alto ahí!

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.703
Alto! Alto!

01:08:44.441 --> 01:08:48.398
Put your hands up. Walk this way.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.200
Do as he tells you, Myers.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.500
You're all through.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:41.314
That's enough!

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:47.415
Lléveselo!

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.157
I'm sorry. We have to have full report.

01:09:56.257 --> 01:10:00.070
You understand. Gracias.

01:10:04.128 --> 01:10:06.149
It's all right.
