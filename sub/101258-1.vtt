I don't
have a problem with weed

01:28.820 --> 01:31.189
and obviously I don't have
a problem with forerunners,

01:31.222 --> 01:33.859
but the combination scares me.

01:33.893 --> 01:34.760
Yeah.

01:34.793 --> 01:36.529
Maybe give me one.

01:36.561 --> 01:39.364
That's totally you
who would take 'em...

01:50.376 --> 01:51.743
Hey.

01:51.777 --> 01:52.679
What can I get ya?

01:55.548 --> 01:57.283
I'll take a beer.

01:57.316 --> 01:58.718
One of those?

01:58.751 --> 01:59.585
Comin' right up.

02:07.325 --> 02:10.662
Did this used to be
The Yellow Dock bar?

02:13.264 --> 02:15.534
I don't know, might have been.

02:21.774 --> 02:25.211
Is this where G.W. Stubbs
murdered Anna Turner?

02:30.883 --> 02:33.820
Are you one of them
Helter Skelter weirdos?

02:58.544 --> 03:02.448
MAN WEARING BLUE
BANDANA: This is the place.

03:06.585 --> 03:07.620
That's great.

03:08.653 --> 03:09.489
Thank you.

03:14.993 --> 03:17.763
Do you like serial killers?

03:17.795 --> 03:20.665
Are you into that kind of thing?

03:20.699 --> 03:21.568
Who's askin'?

03:29.508 --> 03:31.978
- Yeah, you see the jacket?
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.877 --> 03:33.845
I just bought it.

03:34.913 --> 03:36.582
It cost me 1,500 bucks.

MAN WEARING BLUE
BANDANA: What in the hell

03:40.419 --> 03:41.420
you paying 1,500 bucks for?

03:41.453 --> 03:42.455
Right?

03:43.521 --> 03:45.691
There's nothing fancy about it.

03:45.723 --> 03:48.661
I could have gotten a better
jacket for a tenth of that.

03:49.627 --> 03:51.663
You're shopping at the
wrong places, friend.

03:53.564 --> 03:55.668
Well, that's what
you would think,

03:55.700 --> 03:57.469
but this jacket's one of a kind.

03:59.504 --> 04:00.706
Do you want to know why?

04:01.840 --> 04:05.444
This is the jacket
of Danny Raft.

04:06.711 --> 04:07.613
- Who?
- Hm?

04:08.913 --> 04:12.718
You know, the campfire killer.

04:13.618 --> 04:15.554
No shit.

04:15.586 --> 04:16.421
Yeah shit.

MAN WEARING BLUE
BANDANA: Don't you think

04:18.557 --> 04:19.458
it's a little messed up

04:19.490 --> 04:21.459
of you to be wearing that thing?

04:21.492 --> 04:22.928
Sure, but...

04:26.999 --> 04:28.801
It has power.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.836
Yeah, okay.

04:36.541 --> 04:37.575
Why don't you try it on?

04:37.608 --> 04:38.443
No!

04:39.745 --> 04:40.680
What the hell, man?

04:50.456 --> 04:51.290
You see?

04:53.024 --> 04:53.858
Power.

04:53.891 --> 04:54.694
All right, kid.

04:54.726 --> 04:55.727
That's enough.

04:55.761 --> 04:56.963
Get the hell outta here.

04:59.598 --> 05:01.901
Why don't you go ahead and
get the hell outta my bar?

What?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.274
What's going on?

10:10.307 --> 10:11.710
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

10:11.743 --> 10:13.212
Are you serious?

10:13.245 --> 10:14.145
I'm very serious.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.014
Oh my god, oh my god.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.649
Are you kidding me?

10:16.682 --> 10:17.850
This is not funny, Alexa.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.084
Please don't, please.

10:19.116 --> 10:19.951
What?

10:22.788 --> 10:24.690
Hey, Royce!

Oh my god.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.059
Need a lift?

10:27.091 --> 10:28.793
Just headed down to
the ice cream shop.

10:28.826 --> 10:29.427
Oh, that's on our way.

10:29.461 --> 10:30.928

Hey, guys.

10:39.837 --> 10:40.706
Hey, Tori.

10:41.472 --> 10:42.875
Good to see you as always.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.976
- Oh, you know each other?
- Oh yeah, we do.

10:45.009 --> 10:46.912
Yeah, we know her.

10:48.813 --> 10:52.784
Gail, look, I don't
know if you know this,

10:52.817 --> 10:55.220
but your store is
negatively impacting

10:55.253 --> 10:57.823
the image of our community here.

10:57.855 --> 11:00.091
Ooh, is that something
that your daddy told you?

11:00.125 --> 11:01.192
Excuse me?

11:03.227 --> 11:04.929
- Oh my god, oh my god, move!
- What the fuck?

11:04.962 --> 11:06.264
Jesus!

11:25.984 --> 11:28.287
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Look, look, look.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.722
It
looks way better.

11:34.826 --> 11:36.861
Those bitches.

11:45.370 --> 11:48.106
Alexa, could you grab that?

11:48.139 --> 11:49.442
Oh yeah, yeah.

11:53.010 --> 11:53.911
Good job.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.347

11:55.379 --> 11:56.181
There you go.

11:56.214 --> 11:57.817
Here, you take him.

11:59.951 --> 12:00.753
Good job.

12:00.785 --> 12:02.153
You're so brave.

12:02.187 --> 12:03.121
You're so brave.

12:05.823 --> 12:06.925
Gonna go right here, okay?

12:08.927 --> 12:09.827
Okay.

12:20.205 --> 12:21.406
Thank you.

12:21.438 --> 12:23.107

have to do this.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.041

12:24.075 --> 12:26.845
I'm your ride or die, bitch.

12:26.878 --> 12:28.013
I'm not goin' anywhere.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.888
Was that there
when we got here?

12:48.399 --> 12:49.201
Weird.

12:53.904 --> 12:56.074
- I got it, I got it.
- Okay.

12:58.076 --> 12:59.043
Thank you.

12:59.076 --> 12:59.912
Okay.

13:16.561 --> 13:17.963
A knife block?

13:17.995 --> 13:20.999
Ooh, "Crime and Punishment."

13:21.032 --> 13:22.401
Why would someone
deliver it here?

13:22.433 --> 13:24.168
Look, there's no postage,
no return address.

13:24.201 --> 13:26.971
Someone actually
dropped this crap off.

13:27.004 --> 13:29.474
Ooh, look at this.

13:29.506 --> 13:31.543
Have you ever seen
anything so creepy?

13:34.011 --> 13:34.946
So what?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.548
People are just delivering
random junk now?

13:36.581 --> 13:37.950
I don't know.

13:39.384 --> 13:41.385
Oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god.

13:41.418 --> 13:43.221
I have to go.

13:43.254 --> 13:44.856
I will see you tomorrow.

13:46.091 --> 13:46.859
Yeah.

13:47.759 --> 13:51.263
Hey, congratulations
on getting accepted.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.333
Not like it means anything.

13:54.365 --> 13:56.100
Don't say that.

13:56.134 --> 13:57.903
You're gonna make it, Gail.

13:57.936 --> 13:59.405
We're gonna get you outta here.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.124
A box arrived and there's
no note or anything.

Yes.

15:37.634 --> 15:39.170

15:41.038 --> 15:43.609
Gifts,
souvenirs from a crime scene.

15:44.609 --> 15:47.346
Okay, sure, but what killer?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.313
There's no

15:49.346 --> 15:51.983
no proof of ownership.

you'll just have to
take my word for it.

15:54.686 --> 15:57.489
No, look, we
can't use this stuff

15:57.522 --> 16:00.392
unless we have proof
that it's genuine, so.

16:03.094 --> 16:05.197
Who is this anyway?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.098
- I
- need your help, Gail.

16:06.130 --> 16:09.533
All you have to do
is sell these items.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.102
Well, I can't do that.

16:11.135 --> 16:13.004
You'll figure it out.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.373
I have faith.

16:14.405 --> 16:16.173
I don't know you, Gail,

16:16.206 --> 16:19.278

really not that different.

16:20.211 --> 16:22.547
In a way, we're the same.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.117
Your father created us both.

16:26.283 --> 16:28.052
You knew my father?

16:29.220 --> 16:30.455
Not personally,

16:30.488 --> 16:33.659
but you could say
he's my inspiration.

16:35.059 --> 16:37.528
What are you talking about?

16:37.562 --> 16:40.399
You don't know?

16:42.133 --> 16:45.103
Your father is a killer, Gail,

16:45.135 --> 16:47.204
just like all the other freaks

16:47.238 --> 16:49.775
whose junk you pawn at
that store of yours.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.311

16:53.344 --> 16:55.147
I know it's you, okay?!

16:55.179 --> 16:57.081
Don't you have
anything better to do?!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.498
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

17:13.530 --> 17:14.432
You scared me.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.703
Mind answering
a few questions?

17:28.246 --> 17:30.649
I don't even know what I'm
supposed to be looking for.

17:32.416 --> 17:35.286
It's not like I've ever seen
one of these things before.

17:38.288 --> 17:39.490
Traverse City.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.259
Isn't that pretty far?

17:42.292 --> 17:44.195
It's a pretty serious case.

17:48.599 --> 17:50.568
Look, you're not in
any trouble, okay?

17:52.336 --> 17:57.342
I just need to know if you
recognize any of these items.

18:02.212 --> 18:05.084
I sold the jacket to
a kid a couple days ago.

18:06.451 --> 18:08.120
The receipt is from the sale.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.355
Do you remember
anything about the kid?

18:11.388 --> 18:13.824
Did he come in alone or
was he with someone else?

18:13.857 --> 18:15.359
No, he was by himself.

18:16.126 --> 18:17.461
Do you remember
anything unusual

18:17.494 --> 18:19.397
about him or the transaction?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.302
Is he in trouble?

18:28.405 --> 18:31.442
He was wearing that
jacket when we found him.

18:31.476 --> 18:33.178
The receipt was in his pocket.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.715
We're just trying to
put together a timeline.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.350
Oh my god.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.218
When did this happen?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.386
That's what we're
trying to find out.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.889
You need to tell us
everything you know.

18:43.922 --> 18:44.890
What did he buy?

18:45.789 --> 18:47.392
Okay.

18:47.424 --> 18:51.762
Well, he was interested in
the Wade stuff and Beale.

18:54.665 --> 18:58.435
I got the impression
that he'd been picked on.

18:58.469 --> 18:59.703
I think he just wanted something

18:59.737 --> 19:02.274
that would make him
feel less vulnerable.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.878
He couldn't afford
the big name stuff,

19:06.911 --> 19:10.449
but we had taken the jacket
off display a few weeks back.

19:11.782 --> 19:15.519
No one really remembers
Danny Raft anymore, so.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.156
Grandma let it go cheap.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.425
Grandma?

19:20.458 --> 19:21.692
If you want a
t-shirt or a key chain,

19:21.726 --> 19:22.928
I'm your gal,

19:22.961 --> 19:25.896
but if you want some
of the big name stuff,

19:25.930 --> 19:29.768
you have to talk
to Grandma Margot.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.202
And this is her store?

19:31.836 --> 19:32.703
Yes.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.307
Though I've been operating
it since her accident.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.211
Just to be clear,

19:41.179 --> 19:44.416
this jacket is actually
some killer's jacket.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.352
Technically, a
serial killer's jacket.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.322
And you're okay with this?

19:55.993 --> 19:59.363
I never really had a
choice in the matter.

20:00.731 --> 20:02.201
Grandma needed help.

20:07.771 --> 20:12.543
I guess there's some really
sick people out there, huh?

20:14.378 --> 20:15.680
I hope you catch the killer.

20:17.481 --> 20:20.219
Yeah, me too.

20:34.398 --> 20:35.000
Hi.

20:42.472 --> 20:44.475
I'll let you go, okay?

20:47.912 --> 20:49.448
Come here, sweetie.

20:51.415 --> 20:52.250
Go on.

21:08.499 --> 21:10.001
Honey, is that you?

21:10.935 --> 21:14.438
How was everything down
at the store today?

21:14.471 --> 21:15.473
It was fine, Grandma.

21:16.673 --> 21:17.509
Slow.

21:18.643 --> 21:20.377
How's your leg?

21:20.411 --> 21:22.047
Oh, fine, just fine.

21:24.348 --> 21:26.083
Did you remember to bring
the food for Lilith?

21:26.116 --> 21:28.086
Oh god, I'm sorry, Grandma.

21:28.118 --> 21:29.553
I forgot.

21:29.586 --> 21:30.622
It is coming toward
the end of the month.

21:30.654 --> 21:32.456
She is gonna need
to be fed soon.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.659
Yes, I know, Grandma.

21:35.425 --> 21:37.995
And don't stay
in your room all night.

22:08.092 --> 22:10.495
Gail, dinner is ready.

22:11.528 --> 22:13.631
I'm not hungry, Grandma!

22:13.663 --> 22:16.500
I didn't ask if you
were hungry, dear.

22:28.945 --> 22:29.780
Gail?

22:31.915 --> 22:33.617
You're always frowning.

22:34.417 --> 22:37.421
Is it too much to
ask you to smile?

22:47.097 --> 22:49.701
Anything interesting
happen today?

22:51.501 --> 22:54.571
Well, a police officer
came into the store today.

22:54.605 --> 22:56.141
Oh really, what for?

22:58.142 --> 22:59.544
Someone had been murdered.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.013
My goodness.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.983
Well, it wasn't
either of us, was it?

23:07.585 --> 23:08.687
It was an out of towner.

23:10.121 --> 23:12.824
You know, the one that
bought Raft's jacket.

23:16.493 --> 23:19.530
Let's discuss
something more pleasant.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.632
How about that?

23:22.532 --> 23:23.167
Okay.

23:25.936 --> 23:27.638
Any good news to share?

23:34.878 --> 23:36.713
What do you mean?

23:36.747 --> 23:40.986
Hm, something exciting
in the mail maybe?

23:46.123 --> 23:49.795
There was a coupon for
two for one fabric softener.

23:51.962 --> 23:54.798
I put it in the basket
with the other thing.

23:54.832 --> 23:56.668
I knew it had to
be some mistake.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.639
What?

24:01.605 --> 24:04.008
Oh, some silly
man called today

24:04.040 --> 24:07.778
saying he was from the
university's office of admissions.

24:09.713 --> 24:10.548
I know.

24:11.648 --> 24:15.018
I told him it had
to be a mistake.

24:15.051 --> 24:16.186
Grandma.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.756
I told him that
somebody must be playing

24:18.788 --> 24:22.760
some kind of a
practical joke on us.

24:23.861 --> 24:26.765
I mean, you're not leaving.

24:28.231 --> 24:31.903
I explained to him how
much you're needed here.

24:31.935 --> 24:33.770
May I be excused?

24:33.804 --> 24:34.605
Don't be silly.

24:34.638 --> 24:35.973
You need to eat.

24:36.007 --> 24:36.875
Am I silly?

24:37.942 --> 24:38.742
What, dear?

24:38.776 --> 24:39.576
Am I silly?

24:39.609 --> 24:40.644
I don't know.

24:41.746 --> 24:43.181
Who do you think
I get that from?

24:47.551 --> 24:48.953
What are you getting at, Gail?

24:50.153 --> 24:51.021
I don't know.

24:52.056 --> 24:53.692
I don't even know who I am.

24:55.125 --> 24:59.865
Oh, Gail, don't you know
how much I rely on you?

25:02.767 --> 25:06.703
How would I get
along without you?

25:06.737 --> 25:09.541
Who is it that has you so upset?

25:10.708 --> 25:12.777
Who has you talking this way?

25:14.644 --> 25:17.147
Why don't we ever
talk about my parents?

25:18.316 --> 25:20.183
It's that Alexa
girl, isn't it?

25:20.217 --> 25:21.619
I knew she was a trouble maker.

25:21.652 --> 25:23.020
No, Grandma.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.790
We don't even have any
pictures of them or anything.

25:27.791 --> 25:28.726
It is, isn't it?

25:45.643 --> 25:47.879
I suggest you stay away
from her from now on.

25:56.686 --> 25:57.888
And now,

25:57.922 --> 26:00.191
startling news out of
nearby Benzie County

26:00.223 --> 26:03.595
where police were called to the
scene of an apparent murder.

26:03.627 --> 26:06.163
Our own Marsha
Campbell investigates.

26:06.196 --> 26:07.164
Marsha?

26:07.198 --> 26:08.600
Thanks, Chuck.

26:08.633 --> 26:09.334
I'm here on the
scene with the man

26:09.366 --> 26:10.402
who made the gruesome discovery.

26:10.434 --> 26:12.869
And while he does not
want to appear on camera,

26:12.903 --> 26:14.771
he has agreed to speak with us.

26:14.805 --> 26:17.674
He's also given us
exclusive cell phone video

26:17.708 --> 26:20.111
that he shot just before
calling authorities.

26:20.144 --> 26:21.980
Some of the images,
we have blurred

26:22.012 --> 26:24.081
because they're too
shocking for television.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.849
Viewer discretion is advised.

26:27.284 --> 26:29.020
This is a
nice area, it's a good area.

26:29.053 --> 26:30.722
We take all kinds.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.857
So, what prompted
you to go into the apartment?

26:32.890 --> 26:35.326
She'd never
been late with rent before

26:35.358 --> 26:37.761
and her neighbors started
complaining about the smell,

26:37.795 --> 26:40.398
so naturally, I grew concerned.

26:40.431 --> 26:41.833
And do
you always film it

26:41.865 --> 26:43.201
when you go into a
tenant's apartment?

26:43.233 --> 26:45.302
Absolutely, 100%.

26:45.336 --> 26:46.738
It's for protection.

26:54.010 --> 26:56.146
I don't get what
you're freaking out over.

26:57.748 --> 26:58.817
Are you kidding me?

27:02.318 --> 27:03.622
Let me see your phone.

27:11.095 --> 27:12.963
Some of the
images, we have blurred

27:12.997 --> 27:16.868
because they're too
shocking for television.

27:21.705 --> 27:23.407
- So what prompted you to...
- I mean, I guess.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.843
Seriously, Al, look.

27:25.875 --> 27:26.943
I'm looking!

27:26.977 --> 27:28.313
It's just blurry.

27:29.346 --> 27:31.915
This isn't a joke, okay?

27:31.949 --> 27:33.685
I think the killer called me,

27:34.719 --> 27:35.385
and they're for real,

27:35.419 --> 27:36.354
and this proves it.

27:37.954 --> 27:38.789
Wow.

27:39.923 --> 27:42.826
Okay, let's say this
caller is legit.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.362
What did they say?

27:46.463 --> 27:48.865
They want me to
sell this stuff.

27:48.898 --> 27:49.800
And that's it?

27:49.834 --> 27:50.835
They didn't say anything else?

27:51.602 --> 27:56.841
They said, no, just
to sell this stuff.

27:59.375 --> 28:00.845
Okay.

28:00.877 --> 28:02.012
Then we sell it?

28:04.080 --> 28:05.348
We can't sell this.

28:05.382 --> 28:06.817
Gail, you're telling me

28:06.851 --> 28:09.220
that some psycho killer
sends you a package,

28:09.252 --> 28:10.454
calls you like a stalker,

28:10.488 --> 28:11.989
and threatens you if
you don't sell it,

28:12.021 --> 28:13.857
and you're in a
position to refuse?

28:13.891 --> 28:14.992
We have to tell the police.

28:15.025 --> 28:16.494
We have to...

28:16.527 --> 28:17.295
I think if he wants us to
sell it, then we should do it.

28:17.327 --> 28:18.829
No, that's not okay...

28:47.791 --> 28:49.926
What is that up there?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.963
Is that the dental impressions

28:52.997 --> 28:56.234
of Theodore Barry by any chance?

29:00.538 --> 29:01.372
Thank you.

29:13.217 --> 29:15.954
What's the asking
price for this object?

29:22.259 --> 29:26.864
Well, enjoy your teeth.

29:26.896 --> 29:28.131
Thank you.

29:28.164 --> 29:31.335
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you.

29:31.367 --> 29:33.070
- Goodbye.
- Ta ta.

29:38.008 --> 29:39.876
- How long haver I been here?
- I don't know.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.112
Oh my god.

29:41.144 --> 29:44.347
Oh, my break is
probably way over.

29:44.381 --> 29:45.850
I will see you tomorrow.

29:46.916 --> 29:50.020
Don't do anything without
me and don't tell Margot.

29:50.054 --> 29:50.889
Got it?

29:52.021 --> 29:52.923
Okay.

29:52.957 --> 29:53.991
Thank you.

29:54.023 --> 29:54.892
Bye.

30:22.952 --> 30:23.887
Morbid Curiosities,

30:23.921 --> 30:25.056
Benzie County's home of horror.

30:25.088 --> 30:26.624
How can I help you?

30:26.656 --> 30:29.059
Have you
had a chance to reconsider?

30:46.509 --> 30:48.211
What do you want?

30:48.244 --> 30:50.647
- I
- want you to ply my wares

30:50.681 --> 30:51.982
or was that not clear?

30:54.117 --> 30:56.052
I can't do that.

30:56.086 --> 30:57.488
Isn't that what you do?

30:57.520 --> 31:00.590
I'm not asking for
much, just a few items.

31:00.624 --> 31:03.094
I don't even want a cut.

31:03.126 --> 31:05.096
You can keep
anything it fetches.

31:05.128 --> 31:07.063
Well, I don't even
handle these sales.

31:07.096 --> 31:08.398
They go through my grandma.

31:08.432 --> 31:10.067
Let me guess.

31:10.099 --> 31:11.468
You really want your grandmother

31:11.501 --> 31:13.570
to tell you about your parents,

31:13.604 --> 31:14.538
but she won't.

31:15.705 --> 31:17.908
It really was a
terrible accident.

31:17.942 --> 31:20.377
Of course, it wasn't
really an accident.

31:21.612 --> 31:22.513
Your poor mother...

31:22.546 --> 31:24.282
Why are you doing this to me?

31:26.182 --> 31:29.086
It's amazing.

31:29.118 --> 31:31.355
You really do look like her.

31:39.696 --> 31:41.197
They come to your
little sideshow

31:41.230 --> 31:43.233
to get a closer
look into the abyss

31:43.267 --> 31:46.237
while still clutching
firmly to the safety rail.

31:47.471 --> 31:50.474
I choose to remove that
false sense of security.

31:51.642 --> 31:54.245
Your shop provides
a rare opportunity.

31:54.278 --> 31:57.315
I meant, why are
you doing this to me?

31:58.982 --> 32:01.018
I need
to understand you better.

32:01.050 --> 32:04.120
I need to see just
how alike we are.

32:04.153 --> 32:06.057
What are you talking about?

32:06.089 --> 32:09.492
The tree
there has bad seeds, Gail.

32:09.526 --> 32:11.596
Before you cast the first stone,

32:13.196 --> 32:16.199
perhaps you should ask
Margot about G.W. Stubbs.

32:17.433 --> 32:18.601
Who?

32:18.634 --> 32:20.171
Your father.

32:21.337 --> 32:25.175
My father's name
was Gary Niven.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.077
There are
the lies we tell to others

32:27.111 --> 32:29.280
and the lies we tell ourselves.

32:29.313 --> 32:30.281
Which one was that?

32:49.066 --> 32:52.068
Just move it off.

32:56.573 --> 32:57.408
God.

33:00.176 --> 33:01.645
I can be a
witness if you want.

33:03.113 --> 33:04.215
I saw the whole thing.

33:05.816 --> 33:08.052
It was a bunch of
out of towners.

33:08.085 --> 33:11.087
They said they came here
for a pleasant vacation,

33:11.121 --> 33:13.324
not for shit holes
full of murder junk.

33:15.759 --> 33:17.294
Tori, let's go.

33:17.326 --> 33:18.162
See ya.

33:28.238 --> 33:30.107
Come on, you jerk.

33:37.413 --> 33:39.349
Looks like you got
some trouble makers.

33:44.821 --> 33:45.622
Yeah.

33:47.391 --> 33:48.226
It's nothing new.

33:49.826 --> 33:51.628
You don't tell
anyone about it?

33:51.662 --> 33:53.498
Clearly, you're not from here.

33:54.631 --> 33:56.667
Tori's family runs
this town, so.

33:58.201 --> 34:02.105
The Kelly's, I am familiar.

34:03.073 --> 34:07.144
I get the impression they
don't care for your store much.

34:07.176 --> 34:09.212
Yeah, we're
an acquired taste.

34:11.648 --> 34:14.251
I spoke
with your grandmother.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.119
Oh yeah?

34:15.885 --> 34:18.355
She's interesting.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.692
She told me about how
she injured herself.

34:21.724 --> 34:22.826
It sounded pretty bad.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.563
It must have been scary.

34:26.829 --> 34:28.331
Yeah.

34:28.364 --> 34:29.766
I didn't see it, so.

34:34.704 --> 34:37.674
You figure out what
happened to the Raft kid?

34:37.708 --> 34:39.309
We're still workin' on it.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.712
Trying to keep
things low profile.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.148
Apparently,

34:44.181 --> 34:46.317
tourist season is really
important around here.

34:46.349 --> 34:48.152
Just trying not to
scare anyone off.

34:52.655 --> 34:53.489
Thanks.

35:06.235 --> 35:07.670
I caught this one

35:07.704 --> 35:10.173
chewing on one of the
smaller guy's tails.

35:10.206 --> 35:12.208
It nearly came clean off.

35:12.242 --> 35:14.345
Oh god, spare me the details.

35:15.378 --> 35:16.380
Hey, Gail.

35:17.514 --> 35:18.349
Hi, Royce.

35:19.782 --> 35:22.286
Hey Jacob, do you have
anything in a bigger bag?

35:23.686 --> 35:24.487
I'll look in the back.

35:24.521 --> 35:25.356
Thanks.

35:27.423 --> 35:28.759
So what do we have here?

35:28.791 --> 35:30.228
Looking for a new pet?

35:31.394 --> 35:32.695
It's for my grandma.

35:32.728 --> 35:35.899
Yeah, mice are cute, I guess.

35:35.932 --> 35:36.766
To eat.

35:39.869 --> 35:42.339
- What?
- Oh.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.376
She has a snake.

35:46.409 --> 35:47.777
My grandma has a snake.

35:47.811 --> 35:51.315
- Your grandma has a snake?
- Mm-hmm.

35:51.347 --> 35:52.682
I see darkness
runs in the family.

35:57.554 --> 35:59.456
About my cousin, I know
Tori can be a bit much.

35:59.489 --> 36:02.193
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.727
How about I make it up to you?

36:03.760 --> 36:06.464
What do you say a movie
and some ice cream?

36:08.864 --> 36:09.699
No.

36:10.733 --> 36:11.735
Just a movie then?

36:13.469 --> 36:14.871
Sorry.

36:14.905 --> 36:16.440
Royce, we don't have
anything bigger.

36:16.472 --> 36:18.175
Gotcha, thanks for checking.

36:19.643 --> 36:21.579
I have to go
back to my grandma.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.614
Hey Jacob, how late
are you open tonight?

36:23.646 --> 36:24.581
We close at 9:00.

36:24.614 --> 36:25.515
That's perfect.

36:25.548 --> 36:26.317
We'll have time to spare.

36:26.349 --> 36:27.451
Come with me to a movie.

36:27.483 --> 36:28.384
We can skip the ice cream.

36:28.418 --> 36:28.885
I really can't tonight.

36:28.918 --> 36:29.719
I'm sorry.

36:33.422 --> 36:35.325
Okay, I see you.

36:37.293 --> 36:38.295
We'll rain check it.

36:45.869 --> 36:47.004
Thank you.

36:47.036 --> 36:47.837
Thanks, Royce.

36:47.871 --> 36:48.706
Catch you later, Gail.

36:49.572 --> 36:50.340
Hey.

36:51.340 --> 36:52.442
Three bucks.

36:54.010 --> 36:54.844
Three.

36:57.514 --> 36:59.416
So, what do you think

36:59.449 --> 37:01.452
you're going to be
doing with the store?

37:03.420 --> 37:04.887
What do you mean?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.356
Well, if you go
off to college,

37:06.389 --> 37:09.559
if your grandma
happens to pass away.

37:11.327 --> 37:12.228
I mean, I just
figured if she's gone,

37:12.262 --> 37:15.632
you might want to do
something different.

37:17.701 --> 37:18.936
I don't know.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.538
I've never really
thought about it.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.409
Oh, okay.

37:26.409 --> 37:28.311
Great, well have a nice day.

37:28.344 --> 37:29.646
Okay, you too.

37:50.467 --> 37:53.003
Well, what are
you waiting for?

37:54.871 --> 37:56.740
Really, Gail.

37:56.773 --> 37:58.675
Sometimes I can't believe you.

37:58.708 --> 37:59.542
I'm sorry.

38:05.349 --> 38:07.285
You would have
had Lilith starve.

38:08.952 --> 38:11.422
She has a right
to eat, you know?

38:18.527 --> 38:20.363
Snakes are friends to women.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.835
Since all the way
back in the garden.

38:26.536 --> 38:28.838
Adam would have kept us
barefoot and pregnant

38:28.871 --> 38:30.907
and too ignorant to complain.

38:32.675 --> 38:37.414
It was the kindly old serpent
who saved us from that fate.

38:47.523 --> 38:49.326
Clear the table please

38:50.594 --> 38:52.362
and we'll enjoy some cobbler.

38:59.702 --> 39:01.771
Can you do anything right?!

39:02.938 --> 39:03.773
Pick that up!

39:10.179 --> 39:13.549
Grandma, is my
father G.W. Stubbs?

39:13.583 --> 39:15.519
You listen to me, young lady!

39:16.585 --> 39:18.521
Your father is Gary Niven!

39:20.456 --> 39:22.625
Now, that's the end of it!

39:28.632 --> 39:30.634
I'll go get the cobbler.

41:26.682 --> 41:27.717
Jesus.

42:10.693 --> 42:11.795
Policy roll outs.

42:11.827 --> 42:13.931
Harris, before a
primarily Black audience

42:13.963 --> 42:15.731
at the National Urban League.

42:15.764 --> 42:17.333
Breaking news at
the top of the hour.

42:17.367 --> 42:19.069
Local police have now confirmed

42:19.101 --> 42:21.038
the discovery of
another homicide victim

42:21.070 --> 42:23.739
just outside of Frankfort
in Benzie County

42:23.773 --> 42:25.008
only two days after a woman

42:25.041 --> 42:27.144
was found stabbed to
death in her own bed.

42:27.177 --> 42:30.280
Sources tell us a man was
discovered in his living room

42:30.313 --> 42:32.749
apparently killed
with a kitchen knife.

42:32.782 --> 42:34.585
Both of these
attacks come shortly

42:34.617 --> 42:37.219
after a reported killing
just 15 miles away

42:37.253 --> 42:38.689
at a truck stop in...

42:38.722 --> 42:39.856
Now, we know where the
knife block came from.

42:39.889 --> 42:40.891
Panicked residents

42:40.923 --> 42:43.092
are beginning to
express concern.

42:43.126 --> 42:44.127
I don't
know what to think.

42:44.159 --> 42:45.362
It's terrifying.

42:45.394 --> 42:48.331
I keep thinking about
my kids, my wife.

42:55.871 --> 42:57.173
Alexa,

42:57.206 --> 42:58.842
I need you,

42:58.875 --> 43:00.978
I just, I need
some air right now.

43:01.010 --> 43:02.378
I need you to hide
all this stuff.

43:02.411 --> 43:03.946
Okay, okay, where
are you going?

43:03.980 --> 43:06.382
I just, I'll be right back.

43:06.416 --> 43:09.019
Where are you going?!

44:07.710 --> 44:10.713
♪ So, just sit tight ♪

44:21.123 --> 44:23.359
Hello, Alexa.

44:23.393 --> 44:25.695
I was wondering when
I'd get to talk to you.

44:25.728 --> 44:26.362
Nope.

44:52.822 --> 44:53.856
Fuck.

45:11.807 --> 45:13.043
Lookie, lookie.

45:20.150 --> 45:21.852
Well, look at you.

45:23.253 --> 45:24.321
Look at that.

45:28.123 --> 45:28.925
Come on.

45:33.195 --> 45:35.197
G.W. Stubbs?

45:35.231 --> 45:37.000
Yeah?

45:37.032 --> 45:38.067
And you are?

45:38.101 --> 45:40.503
I'm sorry, they didn't
tell me anything about you.

45:40.536 --> 45:41.303
Go ahead.

45:41.336 --> 45:42.972
Do I know you?

45:43.005 --> 45:44.040
No.

45:44.740 --> 45:46.909
I'm just here doing
some research.

45:46.943 --> 45:49.813
I'm a psychology student.

45:49.846 --> 45:51.347
Psychology, eh?

45:51.380 --> 45:53.016
Hm.

45:53.048 --> 45:54.884
So what do you want with me?

45:57.085 --> 46:02.091
Well, I'm interested in how
somebody can become a killer.

46:03.992 --> 46:04.827
Hm.

46:06.362 --> 46:10.400
You know, visiting hours
are pretty limited.

46:10.432 --> 46:12.302
You sure you don't want to
talk about something else

46:12.335 --> 46:17.007
because I'm not sure we can
unpack all this in 15 minutes?

46:17.039 --> 46:18.141
Well, I can be brief.

46:18.173 --> 46:19.009
Yeah.

46:20.844 --> 46:22.880
Tell me about your family.

46:24.047 --> 46:25.014
I'd rather not.

46:27.483 --> 46:30.253
You had a wife and a daughter.

46:30.286 --> 46:31.354
Yeah, but they
had nothing to do

46:31.387 --> 46:32.889
with me turning out like this.

46:32.922 --> 46:33.990
Don't get that wrong.

46:34.724 --> 46:37.326
I was well on my way
before I met Mary Beth.

46:38.193 --> 46:40.429
Mary Beth is your wife?

46:42.632 --> 46:45.501
Listen, I don't mean
to be rude or nothin',

46:45.534 --> 46:47.536
but this is some
pretty famous stuff.

46:47.570 --> 46:51.041
I mean, I realize I'm not as
famous as some of the big guys,

46:51.074 --> 46:52.909
but isn't this in one
of your books somewhere?

46:52.942 --> 46:55.045
Yes, but I just wanted to
hear your perspective of it.

46:55.077 --> 46:56.112
That's all.

46:56.945 --> 46:58.214
How about your parents?

47:00.583 --> 47:02.019
All right, all right, fine.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.257
My mom was terrible to me,
dad was terrible to her.

47:07.289 --> 47:09.092
That's about the extent of it.

47:12.327 --> 47:13.329
And your daughter?

47:18.001 --> 47:19.336
Give me a different question.

47:21.304 --> 47:23.373
Sounds like there's
more to it than that.

47:23.405 --> 47:25.375
Yeah, yeah, well
of course there is.

47:25.407 --> 47:27.043
It doesn't mean I
want to dredge it up.

47:27.076 --> 47:28.110
Hey, listen.

47:29.945 --> 47:31.114
The story's out there.

47:31.146 --> 47:32.882
I'm sure you can find
it easily enough.

47:32.916 --> 47:35.152
Well, it would mean a
lot to me if you told me.

47:40.389 --> 47:41.224
Fine,

47:43.126 --> 47:45.095
but don't say I didn't warn ya.

47:53.036 --> 47:56.572
My dad, Lemuel Stubbs,

47:56.606 --> 47:59.075
was a drunk and a
thug his whole life.

47:59.108 --> 48:01.010
He raped my mother
once she was 16

48:02.478 --> 48:04.146
and when his seed stuck,

48:05.614 --> 48:07.283
her parents forced
them to marry.

48:11.186 --> 48:13.589
Now, once I was born,

48:17.659 --> 48:19.161
how much affection
do you suppose

48:19.195 --> 48:20.898
either one of them had for me?

48:24.166 --> 48:28.505
So, was it in my raising
or was it in my blood?

48:31.708 --> 48:32.876
Could be a little bit of both,

48:32.909 --> 48:35.211
but I'd be willing to bet that
anyone raised by that woman

48:35.244 --> 48:37.047
would have turned
out just the same.

48:38.481 --> 48:43.053
Hell, that bitch was a fuckin'
murderer before I ever was.

48:44.653 --> 48:49.626
When I was 10, mother took
her revenge of Lemuel.

48:50.693 --> 48:52.095
Hm?

48:52.128 --> 48:53.697
They called it
accidental overdose,

48:53.730 --> 48:56.398
but I saw her feedin'
him those pain pills

48:56.431 --> 48:58.067
drunk as he was.

48:58.101 --> 49:01.538
She murdered him
right in front of me

49:01.570 --> 49:05.141
and no one blames
her for anything.

49:05.173 --> 49:06.208
You know,

49:06.242 --> 49:08.545
she pawned my shit to
get herself outta trouble

49:08.577 --> 49:10.146
and I'm the one in here.

49:12.681 --> 49:14.384
Shouldn't you be
taking that down?

49:15.385 --> 49:16.219
Sorry.

49:33.101 --> 49:34.136
Double jointed.

49:43.278 --> 49:44.646
You know, I quit for a while.

49:44.679 --> 49:45.581
Did you know that?

49:47.717 --> 49:52.122
Didn't have the need to do it,

49:53.822 --> 49:55.224
as long as I had Mary Beth.

49:58.226 --> 50:01.030
And you, you remind me of her,

50:06.369 --> 50:07.204
pretty

50:11.206 --> 50:12.241
and delicate.

50:16.478 --> 50:17.614
What happened to her?

50:23.318 --> 50:27.389
That's another question
for another time.

50:28.391 --> 50:29.760
Oh, looks like my time's up.

50:31.126 --> 50:32.362
Wait.

50:32.394 --> 50:33.762
You know, it was really
nice talking to you.

50:33.795 --> 50:37.199
Did you happen to know
the name Gary Niven?

50:37.233 --> 50:38.168
Gary Niven?

50:38.201 --> 50:39.135
No, I never heard of him.

50:39.168 --> 50:42.704
Well, do you know who this is?

50:42.737 --> 50:45.574
Holy Moe, where'd
you get that?!

50:45.608 --> 50:46.676
That's me.

50:46.708 --> 50:47.676
That's a picture.

50:49.112 --> 50:50.213
Well, hold on.

50:50.246 --> 50:51.548
Wait, no, no, no, don't go,

50:51.581 --> 50:52.682
don't go, no, no, no, no!

50:52.715 --> 50:53.483
Who are?

50:53.516 --> 50:54.384
I said, who are you?

50:55.284 --> 50:56.318
Who are you?

50:57.186 --> 50:58.255
Who are you?!

51:23.278 --> 51:25.347
Can someone get me a soda?

51:25.380 --> 51:26.281
Yeah, what kind?

51:26.315 --> 51:27.250
I don't care, something diet.

52:34.282 --> 52:37.621
Oh my god, my car!

52:38.688 --> 52:40.590
I can be a
witness if you want.

52:41.690 --> 52:43.492
I saw the whole thing.

52:43.525 --> 52:45.394
It was an out of towner.

52:45.427 --> 52:47.297
They said they hate
spoiled rich kids

52:47.329 --> 52:50.199
whose parents buy their
affection with shiny bullshit.

52:50.233 --> 52:51.935
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

52:51.967 --> 52:53.335
She's got a knife!

52:55.338 --> 52:56.873
Are you nuts?

52:56.905 --> 52:58.373
You need to stay away from me

52:58.407 --> 53:00.510
and stay away from my
cousin, you psycho!

53:03.311 --> 53:06.583
- Get out of here.
- I'm callin' the cops.

53:07.916 --> 53:08.918
Go!

53:20.295 --> 53:21.697
Sorry.

53:41.884 --> 53:43.253
Damn it, shit.

54:26.594 --> 54:27.429
Gail.

54:30.565 --> 54:32.534
Drivin' pretty fast,
don't you think?

54:32.568 --> 54:34.437
I'm sorry.

54:34.469 --> 54:35.904
I didn't even realize.

54:36.771 --> 54:37.706
Everything okay?

54:39.442 --> 54:41.411
Where are you coming from?

54:41.443 --> 54:44.846
I was just running
errands for my grandma.

54:44.880 --> 54:45.882
Coming from Traverse?

54:45.914 --> 54:47.349
Yeah.

54:47.382 --> 54:48.417
Store's not open today?

54:49.784 --> 54:51.553
My friend Alex is watching it.

54:52.521 --> 54:53.589
She work there too?

54:53.621 --> 54:57.460
No, just doing me a favor.

54:58.827 --> 55:01.398
Then she wouldn't know
anything about these murders?

55:03.532 --> 55:04.768
What do you mean?

55:06.101 --> 55:07.103
The first victim

55:07.137 --> 55:09.439
bought that killer's
jacket at your store, Gail.

55:10.539 --> 55:13.842
The second victim had a
receipt in your handwriting,

55:15.478 --> 55:17.480
showing he dropped quite
a bit of money there too.

55:19.782 --> 55:21.851
So you're saying that
there's a connection

55:21.884 --> 55:23.719
between the store
and the killings?

55:24.652 --> 55:25.987
What I'm saying, Gail,

55:26.021 --> 55:27.890
is that your grandmother's
in a wheelchair.

55:27.922 --> 55:29.425
She lacks the mobility.

55:30.525 --> 55:31.560
But you?

55:33.528 --> 55:36.532
I gotta say things aren't
looking great for you.

55:39.168 --> 55:41.771
Someone's killing people
connected to your store.

55:43.438 --> 55:45.607
It's looking like
you're either guilty

55:45.641 --> 55:48.110
or in a substantial
amount of danger.

55:51.713 --> 55:53.717
- Am I being detained?
- Excuse me?

55:56.619 --> 55:57.586
Can I go now?

56:02.490 --> 56:06.161
This was an opportunity
to come clean, Gail,

56:06.195 --> 56:07.731
maybe help me catch a murderer.

56:10.465 --> 56:12.101
I know your store's
connected somehow

56:13.902 --> 56:15.971
and I know you're
keeping things from me.

56:35.523 --> 56:37.460
I can't believe you.

56:37.492 --> 56:38.860
Slashing Tori's tires,

56:38.893 --> 56:41.530
you do realize
that's insane, right?

56:43.565 --> 56:46.668
Insane but pretty awesome.

56:49.672 --> 56:50.673
Really?

56:51.706 --> 56:54.576
I mean, I wouldn't make
a habit of it, but yeah.

56:55.610 --> 56:57.913
To be honest, I was sort of
wondering how it happened.

56:59.581 --> 57:00.682
What do you mean?

57:01.349 --> 57:03.685
You know, how you would snap.

57:04.586 --> 57:06.021
What?

57:06.054 --> 57:06.955
Let's be honest.

57:06.989 --> 57:08.191
Everyone has a breaking point

57:08.224 --> 57:10.026
and you were well over
due for something crazy.

57:12.961 --> 57:13.862
Hey, don't worry.

57:13.896 --> 57:14.898
It's not like you hurt anyone.

57:18.733 --> 57:20.702
Al, can I use your computer?

57:22.036 --> 57:24.673
So I just threw the glasses
in the box and bailed.

57:26.742 --> 57:28.611
You should really
think about leaving

57:29.777 --> 57:32.815
because if I'm gonna
be really honest,

57:34.817 --> 57:37.085
all of this has been
freaking me out.

57:39.621 --> 57:42.524
From the caller today and
then the guy's glasses.

57:45.894 --> 57:47.797
Gail, are you listening to me?

57:47.829 --> 57:49.498
Earth to Gail.

57:49.532 --> 57:50.666
Sorry.

57:50.699 --> 57:51.733
I'm sorry.

57:54.670 --> 57:58.106
I just wanted to let
you know that I get it now.

58:02.878 --> 58:03.713
Alexa,

58:07.815 --> 58:08.917
what is this?

58:13.688 --> 58:16.558
What do you think it is, Gail?

58:21.329 --> 58:22.831
What did you do?

58:24.065 --> 58:26.535
- She knows my name, Gail.
- Oh my god.

58:26.568 --> 58:28.971
I'm not getting
killed over some bullshit.

58:29.938 --> 58:31.139
You should be thanking me!

58:31.172 --> 58:32.674
Thanking you?

58:32.708 --> 58:33.309
Did you see how much it sold?

58:33.342 --> 58:34.744
It's a win win.

58:34.777 --> 58:35.811
Now you have enough
to get out of here

58:35.844 --> 58:37.614
and neither of us are dying.

58:40.748 --> 58:41.951
I mean, what was your plan?

58:41.983 --> 58:43.652
Were you going to
tell the police?

58:45.054 --> 58:45.889
When?

58:48.023 --> 58:49.858
What is going on?

58:49.891 --> 58:50.893
What are you hiding?

58:50.925 --> 58:51.760
Nothing.

58:54.797 --> 58:58.067
You left me alone
all day in that place.

58:59.201 --> 59:00.702
I didn't know what to do.

59:01.836 --> 59:03.773
You didn't tell me
where you were going,

59:03.806 --> 59:04.706
what you were doing.

59:04.740 --> 59:06.909
Don't you realize
what you've just done?

59:06.942 --> 59:08.844
You've just tied
us to the killings.

59:08.876 --> 59:09.978
We're suspects now.

59:10.012 --> 59:11.714
Look, I put it up.

59:11.746 --> 59:13.748
If it's coming down on anyone,
it's coming down on me.

59:13.782 --> 59:15.017
You don't have to do anything.

59:15.050 --> 59:16.285
I don't need you
to do that, okay?

59:16.318 --> 59:17.787
I don't need you
to take care of me.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.588
I can take care of myself.

59:19.621 --> 59:20.856
This whole victim shit.

59:24.226 --> 59:25.827
You act so independent,

59:25.860 --> 59:27.829
but we both know the
reason you live alone

59:27.862 --> 59:29.865
is because your family
doesn't want you.

59:37.039 --> 59:39.075
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

59:42.143 --> 59:43.678
Yes, you did.

59:43.711 --> 59:44.347
No, I didn't.

59:47.048 --> 59:47.951
You can get out.

59:49.985 --> 59:52.689
- Alexa, I really didn't...
- No, you can get out.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.088
Kozlov was
a foreign language teacher

01:00:27.121 --> 01:00:30.259
at Frankfort High School
and a noted book lover.

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.193
He leaves behind no family.

01:00:32.226 --> 01:00:33.828
The state police have
now been called in

01:00:33.862 --> 01:00:36.898
to deal with what increasingly
looks like a serial killer

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:39.100
operating in the
Lower Peninsula.

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:41.170
Authorities are asking
anyone with information

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:43.206
to call this emergency hotline.

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:28.409
♪ Hoo, hoo, hoo, do everything ♪

01:02:28.443 --> 01:02:30.946
♪ There is a season ♪

01:02:30.978 --> 01:02:33.482
And it appears
that yours is over.

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.384
There, there.

01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:39.054
This pains me more
than it pains you.

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:44.926
There's some spotting
on this leaf.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.163
I'm gonna give you a spray.

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:53.903
Every time.

01:02:56.271 --> 01:02:57.507
Have it your way.

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.456
I can explain if you'll let me.

01:03:16.324 --> 01:03:19.460
I know I shouldn't
have lied to you,

01:03:19.494 --> 01:03:23.164
but you wanted to leave.

01:03:23.197 --> 01:03:26.268
I had to make you see
how much I needed you.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.536
Stay away from me.

01:03:27.568 --> 01:03:30.940
There's no need to
hide, Gail, really.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.245
You know, don't you?

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:39.849
I don't know how,

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.884
but you found out the
truth about your father.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.590
I wanted to tell
you the truth, Gail,

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.630
but I did everything
I could, Gail!

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:57.399
I did my best, I truly did,

01:03:57.431 --> 01:04:00.935
but your father grew
up broken inside.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:05.041
An evil that he inherited from
his father took root in him.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.175
But you,

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.213
I wouldn't make those
same mistakes with you.

01:04:12.246 --> 01:04:14.616
I could do better
the second time.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.117
I could make it right.

01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:20.356
Look, one of my
lemon trees was sick.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:21.990
The root was so ill

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:23.958
that the entire tree
began to wither,

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:28.097
so I took the branches
of this lemon tree

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:32.401
and I grafted them here so
the healthiest tree I have,

01:04:32.434 --> 01:04:33.636
a lime tree.

01:04:33.668 --> 01:04:36.504
And look at it thrive, Gail.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:38.106
Look at it grow.

01:04:38.139 --> 01:04:39.908
And that is you, honey.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:40.943
That is you!

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:45.114
The same root, but thriving
on a different tree.

01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:47.115
I knew that if I could keep you

01:04:47.148 --> 01:04:50.219
from the fruit of
that poisonous root,

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:51.920
you would be fine.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:56.125
If I could just take you
away and keep you with me,

01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:56.991
you would be okay.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:04:58.494
And look at you, honey!

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:01.029
You are!

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.030
You are!

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:04.132
- Stop!
- You are so beautiful!

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.067
Get off of me!

01:05:05.099 --> 01:05:06.367
What's gotten into you, Gail?

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.036
What has gotten into you?

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.338
Get off!

01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:10.206
Get off!

01:05:41.235 --> 01:05:42.570
God.

01:05:44.172 --> 01:05:46.641
Please
record your message.

01:05:47.509 --> 01:05:48.744
Al, please, please,

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:50.211
I really need to
talk to you, okay?

01:05:50.244 --> 01:05:53.081
So just call me please,
please, please, please.

01:06:06.193 --> 01:06:07.096
Alexa?

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:12.969
Alexa?

01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:17.239
Alexa, I really
need to talk to you.

01:06:24.478 --> 01:06:25.313
Alexa?

01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:28.517
Where are you going?

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.353
I really need to
talk to you please.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.122
What do you mean no?

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:33.990
Why?

01:06:34.688 --> 01:06:36.057
Why?

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.460
Alexa, please, you can't
leave me here alone.

01:06:38.492 --> 01:06:40.596
Get off my car!

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:43.065
- Please!
- Get off!

01:06:43.097 --> 01:06:44.365
Alexa!

01:06:44.398 --> 01:06:45.400
Don't leave!

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.155
Nice day.

01:07:40.188 --> 01:07:42.190
You about ready to tell me
what's going on around here?

01:07:43.425 --> 01:07:44.527
This is a little thin.

01:07:45.726 --> 01:07:47.295
People keep secrets, Gail.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.230
Just because she lied to you,

01:07:48.262 --> 01:07:49.297
it doesn't make her a murderer.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.499
You said it yourself.

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:53.068
We're the only ones
connected to all of it.

01:07:54.235 --> 01:07:55.703
Everything leads
back to the store.

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:57.739
Okay, but is
there any evidence?

01:07:57.771 --> 01:07:59.275
I mean, what's her motive?

01:08:00.608 --> 01:08:03.478
I don't even think he
knows she's doing it.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:07.483
Sometimes it's like she's
two different people.

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.284
There's all sorts of
people who live this life...

01:08:09.317 --> 01:08:12.320
No, I wouldn't be telling you
this if I didn't believe it.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:17.426
Okay.

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.203
Just stay in the car.

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:30.837
Stay put.

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:32.274
Don't move.

01:08:32.305 --> 01:08:33.108
Just wait for the
other officers.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.675
Wait, what
are you gonna do?

01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:35.577
Don't worry.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.377
I'll be right back.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:01.336
Margot Niven?

01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:02.737
This is the police.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.278
Officer?

01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:51.420
Officer, are you in here?

01:09:58.859 --> 01:09:59.694
Grandma?

01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:05.466
Grandma?

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:15.911
Oh my god.

01:10:37.966 --> 01:10:38.767
Grandma!

01:10:44.405 --> 01:10:45.606
Officer!

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:53.716
Officer?

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:07.895
Officer, did you?

01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:34.422
This isn't a self
inflicted wound, Gail.

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:36.490
Then, then...

01:11:36.524 --> 01:11:37.526
Drop the knife.

01:11:43.064 --> 01:11:43.999
Don't move.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.402
Wait, this isn't right...

01:11:47.435 --> 01:11:50.405
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

01:11:50.438 --> 01:11:51.539
But I didn't do this.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.875
Then who did, Gail?

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:55.510
Since the beginning,

01:11:55.543 --> 01:11:57.045
everything has pointed
back to that store

01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:59.581
and now the only other
person tied to it is gone.

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.487
I promise I didn't do this.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.022
A girl
matching your description

01:12:07.055 --> 01:12:09.423
pulled a knife at some kids
in town the other night.

01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:11.560
That wasn't you either?

01:12:11.592 --> 01:12:13.561
I never hurt anyone.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.430
I flagged your ID
at Pugsley Corrections

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:17.398
visiting a serial killer.

01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.534
You have to admit that
doesn't look good.

01:12:21.869 --> 01:12:22.704
Don't.

01:12:26.039 --> 01:12:28.743
Get on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

01:13:05.046 --> 01:13:07.082
I gave you every opportunity.

01:13:09.484 --> 01:13:11.653
So many chances to
do the right thing.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.689
Since I met you,

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:21.162
I had to know if you
were like Margot.

01:13:22.163 --> 01:13:25.833
So quick to sell my mother's
things for spare change.

01:13:27.234 --> 01:13:29.670
All you had to do was tell
me about the souvenirs

01:13:30.738 --> 01:13:32.606
and just turn the evidence over

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.143
and prove that you
were different.

01:13:37.177 --> 01:13:38.579
Instead, you sold them.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.118
You could have lived.

01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:46.855
- I promise you I didn't...
- Shut up.

01:13:51.225 --> 01:13:52.960
You're just like him.

01:13:55.095 --> 01:13:56.964
You're just like your father.

01:13:59.567 --> 01:14:01.002
You're a bad seed.

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.542
You, and her,

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:11.846
and the rest of the degenerates
that shop at that store,

01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:16.018
reveling in people's pain.

01:14:27.828 --> 01:14:28.963
What happened to you?

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:34.203
That man you visited, Stubbs,

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:38.640
he killed my mother.

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.645
He always loved her less
than he loved yours.

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:48.717
He's your father?

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:54.188
I told you he created us both.

01:14:56.623 --> 01:14:57.259
No.

01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:00.795
Your family tree
needs pruning, Gail.

01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:07.503
You're a bad seed.

01:16:38.192 --> 01:16:39.161
You again.

01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:45.367
Margot told me you were dead.

01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:48.036
She said the same
thing about you.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:52.106
Margot's dead.

01:16:56.043 --> 01:16:57.878
Oh, how'd it happen?

01:17:01.682 --> 01:17:02.751
Was it you?

01:17:05.252 --> 01:17:06.755
Tell me about my mother.

01:17:09.823 --> 01:17:10.858
Your mother?

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:12.860
Shit.

01:17:18.099 --> 01:17:22.069
Well, I never been so scared
of somebody in my life.

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:27.376
That woman could destroy me
just by walking out the door.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:34.916
I mean, if she ever
learned what I'd done,

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:37.819
what I was,

01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:43.258
she was a dream that I was
scared to wake up from.

01:17:48.895 --> 01:17:50.431
You really don't remember her?

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:52.367
No.

01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:55.936
I don't even know
what she looks like.

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:56.805
Oh man.

01:17:58.372 --> 01:17:59.807
I'm so sorry about that.

01:18:01.975 --> 01:18:03.944
Those first few
years of your life,

01:18:03.978 --> 01:18:06.047
she just loved
the shit outta you

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:11.453
which is something I didn't
have until far too late.

01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:14.889
She loved you.

01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:18.893
She held you and
she cared for you,

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:20.862
she cared for you

01:18:20.895 --> 01:18:22.998
like you were her most
precious thing in her life,

01:18:25.298 --> 01:18:26.201
'cause you were.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.976
The days are real long in here

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:38.980
and I got a lot
of time to think.

01:18:40.814 --> 01:18:44.085
I never imagined this.

01:18:47.087 --> 01:18:47.988
Stand up.

01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:48.922
Let me take a look at you.

01:18:48.956 --> 01:18:52.060
No, that's not why I'm here.

01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:55.130
You don't get to
have a daughter.

01:19:02.103 --> 01:19:04.005
You're not coming
back, are you?

01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:52.587
Miss?

01:19:52.619 --> 01:19:53.521
Excuse me, miss?

01:19:56.556 --> 01:19:57.958
We usually don't do
things like this,

01:19:57.992 --> 01:20:02.963
but your father wanted
me to give you that.

01:21:03.957 --> 01:21:04.658
God.

01:21:14.568 --> 01:21:15.936
You all right?

01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:22.176
