WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:12.722
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:17.059
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:22.565
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:25.067 --> 00:28.863
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:34.827
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:45.463
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

02:52.089 --> 02:53.799
Ouch.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.051
What happened to him?

02:56.969 --> 02:57.970
What?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.639
What happened to the Seer?

03:01.891 --> 03:02.892
The Seer?

03:03.893 --> 03:06.061
They told me he had gone.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.522
There was fresh blood
on the ground.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.277
Well, he must've made a sacrifice.
What do I know?

03:13.569 --> 03:15.654
You're drunk. both of you.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.490
If he's gone,
we need to find him.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.617
And if somebody
has tried to kill him,

03:20.493 --> 03:21.494
we need to know who

03:21.994 --> 03:24.246
and why. Otherwise, the
gods are not going to...

03:24.371 --> 03:26.665
You do not speak on behalf
of the gods, Hvitserk.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.502
Only I can.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.091
And IWill

03:37.843 --> 03:38.844
when I choose.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.096
Understand?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.019
I know.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.065
I know.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.367
What is it?

04:07.206 --> 04:10.084
King Harald and his army are
less than two days away.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.712
Our army is ready,
and we will ride out tomorrow.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.925
If, with your help,
and God's grace,

04:18.050 --> 04:19.927
we manage to defeat our enemies,

04:20.094 --> 04:23.138
then I swear to you
by everything most holy

04:23.222 --> 04:25.558
that I will freely grant you
the lands of East Anglia

04:25.641 --> 04:27.393
promised to you
by my grandfather.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.314
You would have
the strength to do so?

04:34.692 --> 04:36.193
I would have the strength

04:36.402 --> 04:39.196
and the determination to do so.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.186
What is this?

05:12.021 --> 05:13.772
The Franks call it a catapult.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.525
They used them
against us in Paris.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.236
I think they could be useful.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.365
Cut the rope.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.339
Stop!

05:39.590 --> 05:41.133
Never hesitate.

06:01.779 --> 06:02.947
Good.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.205
My people,

06:13.332 --> 06:15.250
we have suffered
a terrible loss.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.128
All of us.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.591
The Seer has been taken from us.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.765
Believe me, we are doing
everything that we can

06:29.848 --> 06:32.059
to find out what
has happened to him.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.021
We need him.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.400
No one can remember Kattegat
without the Seer.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.276
He knows everything about us,

06:44.113 --> 06:45.489
all about our past,

06:47.574 --> 06:50.744
and everything about what
the future holds for us.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.547
I will find whoever did this

07:01.755 --> 07:04.800
and make him pay in blood
for what he has done to us.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.639
In the meantime,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.226
do not be afraid

07:14.810 --> 07:17.062
that I have been revealed
to be a god.

07:17.813 --> 07:21.483
The gods have always
lived amongst us.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.320
It will not affect your lives.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.741
It will not change anything,

07:29.324 --> 07:33.704
except that you are all
entitled to be proud

07:34.204 --> 07:36.248
that you are ruled over by a god

07:40.127 --> 07:42.546
and that, soon, my wife

07:43.422 --> 07:45.799
will provide us
with a divine child.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.761
Hail Ivar.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.013
<i>Ha“ N at.</i>

07:51.138 --> 07:52.806
<i>Ha“ N at.</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:37.768
How do I look?

08:38.852 --> 08:41.063
Almost as you should.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.190
"Almost"?

08:53.492 --> 08:54.493
My Lord,

08:55.410 --> 08:56.411
my King,

08:57.913 --> 08:59.081
my husband.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.386
We are on the eve of battle.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.848
You should wear your arm ring

09:17.266 --> 09:18.559
as well as your cross.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.937
No.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.606
You need the protection
of their God

09:25.357 --> 09:26.358
and of ours.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.905
I do not think our gods will
protect me if I'm wearing this.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.043
Please.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.131
Put it on.

09:50.883 --> 09:51.925
For my sake

09:52.843 --> 09:53.927
and for yours.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.223
The King wants to see you.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.361
I must renounce you.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.531
I must renounce our love.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.743
I don't understand.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.036
What has happened?

10:19.661 --> 10:21.496
The Lord came to me last night.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.042
He showed me a vision.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.170
A vision of hell...

10:39.806 --> 10:43.310
and the damned that must endure
its fires for all eternity.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.028
And I was afraid.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.082
You?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.211
Yes.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.173
Yes.
But it was just a dream.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.549
No.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.471
In my vision, the Lord,
our God, spoke to me.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.101
<i>He told me that I must renounce
my sinful ways once and for all,</i>

11:25.102 --> 11:28.563
<i>or I would never see
his divine face.</i>

11:29.356 --> 11:32.067
I would never hear
his divine voice,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.196
only the screams and
Iamentations of the damned.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.917
You weren't there.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.838
You didn't see what I saw.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.840
You can't do this.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.926
You can't do this to me.
I thought you loved me.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.855
You know something?

12:11.356 --> 12:14.609
I think you always loved
your Lord, your God, more

12:15.360 --> 12:16.820
than you ever loved me.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.700
I don't think
you ever did love me.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.412
Your soul,

12:26.788 --> 12:29.541
whatever that is,

12:30.751 --> 12:33.837
meant more to you
than I ever could.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.658
Are you certain

13:04.201 --> 13:05.869
that your plan is going to work?

13:07.579 --> 13:08.830
You must trust me.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.586
But the plan...
The plan will work

13:14.961 --> 13:16.129
if you believe in me.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.675
You need to find your courage.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.929
You need to believe in me, but
you need to believe in yourself,

13:24.012 --> 13:25.806
or you're not fit
to wear that crown.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.435
What?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.979
We risk killing our own men.

13:37.526 --> 13:38.735
Do you want to win?

13:49.538 --> 13:50.705
My sons.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.793
May the Lord, in his mercy,
keep you both safe.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.920
Care for each other.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.588
I've heard it said,

13:58.672 --> 14:02.467
"In battle, no one is more
important than your own brother."

14:06.429 --> 14:08.348
But now we must
go and face the day.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.233
Care for each other.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.568
At arms!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.443
- Strength to your arm. sire.
- Take courage. sire.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.170
My Lord Cyneheard.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.755
Yes, sire.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.798
You'll not be leaving
with us today.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.218
Why on Earth?

15:28.053 --> 15:29.554
Because you are arrested

15:30.889 --> 15:31.890
for treason.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.524
- Forward.
- Get off me! No!

15:53.703 --> 15:55.664
Get off me!

15:55.747 --> 15:56.915
Leave me alone!

15:57.332 --> 15:58.750
I'm innocent!

16:12.222 --> 16:14.307
There's been a terrible mistake.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.101
No doubt.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.895
My Lord Cyneheard, no doubt.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.815
The King is wrong. I've never
conspired against him,

16:21.898 --> 16:23.149
as God is my witness.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.234
Stop.

16:24.943 --> 16:29.698
Invoking the name of our Lord
does not make a man innocent.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.537
We have good account
of your treachery.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.456
But it's true,

16:38.915 --> 16:41.084
we lack details.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.840
Who did you conspire with?

16:47.048 --> 16:51.219
Believe me, My Lady, I'm innocent
of these vile accusations.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.180
I know nothing
of any conspiracy.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.809
Perhaps you're right.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.645
Perhaps you're right.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.148
But still,

17:03.773 --> 17:06.192
we must test your innocence.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.445
"Test"?

17:11.281 --> 17:13.033
We will torture you

17:14.326 --> 17:16.244
to see if you're
telling the truth.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.414
Gentlelady, no!

17:22.667 --> 17:25.420
And that was your
mistake, My Lord.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.008
Thinking me a gentlelady.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.975
Over there with all the others.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.977
- Where?
- Over here.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.941
Gather your arms. Bring them here.
Gather them together.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.236
There, Ubbe.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.239
Ubbe,

17:54.324 --> 17:56.493
son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.496
We met again.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.124
Welcome.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.709
Please.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.797
Maybe he will bring us
good fortune.

18:10.715 --> 18:11.716
Ubbe,

18:12.133 --> 18:13.760
this is Jarl Olavsonn.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.845
He has been at York.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.139
And this is his wife Gunnhild.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.433
Oh, I remember fighting at York.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.394
What a time we had.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.270
Oh. By the gods!

18:24.479 --> 18:27.941
The exploits of The Great Army are still
remembered and celebrated in York.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.111
And everywhere else around the
world too, I shouldn't wonder.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.445
That is true.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.741
I have heard all the stories of
you and Ivar and Bjorn Ironside.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.202
Bring us a drink.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.495
Of course, King Harald.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.455
We're thirsty and among friends.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.082
Please.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.500
AII sit down.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.460
So,

18:48.128 --> 18:49.712
Ubbe, tell me,

18:51.673 --> 18:53.925
what are you doing,
fighting for the Christians?

18:56.010 --> 18:58.930
<i>You and War drove us out of Kattega't.
What are we supposed to do?</i>

19:00.181 --> 19:02.434
King Alfred
offered us protection

19:03.101 --> 19:05.353
and the lands in England
my father fought for.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.981
Huh. Well, I understand.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.941
- Skol.
- Skol.

19:16.072 --> 19:20.118
But I know from experience that no one
ever gives you anything for nothing.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.330
You're wrong to suppose that King
Alfred will give you those lands.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.415
He won't.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.583
He's a Saxon.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.462
He will offer you
sweet promises,

19:30.670 --> 19:31.671
but, in the end,

19:32.380 --> 19:33.673
if you want those lands,

19:34.466 --> 19:35.842
you will have to fight for them.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.678
That's why Ragnar was wrong.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.891
It's not a matter
of negotiation.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.768
It's always a matter of blood.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.606
You and Bjorn and Lagertha,
you should join with us.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.232
We have a formidable army.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.445
And I'm certain we can
overcome Alfred's forces.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.363
And what would happen then?

19:58.573 --> 20:01.284
You would capture
Lagertha, Bjorn, me.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.369
<i>Hand us over to War.</i>

20:03.953 --> 20:06.664
Of course not.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.753
King Harald has already told me that,
after our successful raid here,

20:12.170 --> 20:15.548
we shall all return to Kattegat
and overthrow King Ivar.

20:16.382 --> 20:20.220
King Alfred's army will not be so
easy to overcome as you suppose.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.849
It may be better
we find a compromise.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.648
Why would you want a compromise?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.026
Because I am a Christian.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.947
I have been baptized.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.242
I cannot believe that.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.035
You?

20:45.328 --> 20:47.413
The son of Ragnar Lothbrok?

20:47.538 --> 20:49.749
Yes, me,
a son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.337
I know my father
would have understood.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.010
What kind of compromise?

21:02.637 --> 21:05.139
Tell us the weight you need
in gold and silver

21:05.348 --> 21:07.100
to go and leave Wessex.

21:21.864 --> 21:22.865
Very well.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.035
Come back tomorrow,
and we'll tell you

21:26.119 --> 21:30.540
and your Christian friends
what you must pay.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.926
Were you part of a conspiracy

21:42.010 --> 21:45.430
to overthrow my son Alfred?

21:45.722 --> 21:46.764
No.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.725
No, My Lady.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.311
Please, please.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.604
Think again.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.358
Were you part of a conspiracy,

21:57.442 --> 21:59.485
and who else was involved?

22:08.703 --> 22:11.456
I need to know, My Lord.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.418
And I will know.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.642
Yet another
son of Ragnar Lothbrok?

23:12.975 --> 23:13.976
Yes.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.937
And you want to fight
against your brothers?

23:16.813 --> 23:17.814
Yes.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.108
You were not sent here
with a message?

23:20.608 --> 23:23.361
No, I didn't want to fight
for the Saxons.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.156
I'm not a Saxon. I'm not Christian.
I'm Viking.

23:28.533 --> 23:31.452
I'd like to kill
all of the Christians.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.791
I didn't want to fight
alongside King Alfred.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.379
So the King is with his army?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.341
Yes.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.184
At least you have told me
something useful.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.522
There's no news.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.024
No one has come.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.234
Of course not.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.736
They are not going to come.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.614
They were not
really negotiating.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.077
While we have been waiting here,

24:13.619 --> 24:17.415
they have moved their entire
army around our flanks,

24:18.082 --> 24:19.834
and they are now
almost certainly positioned

24:19.917 --> 24:22.712
in the very place they had already
chosen for the battleground.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.174
We must turn back and face them.

24:30.595 --> 24:33.222
And you must both forgive me

24:34.682 --> 24:38.019
because the sons of Ragnar have
already made a fool of me.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.064
<i>God works in mysterious ways.</i>

25:34.200 --> 25:35.409
Each one of you,

25:36.744 --> 25:38.079
ask yourselves,

25:38.913 --> 25:40.456
do you know His ways?

25:52.426 --> 25:55.429
Can you be so sure
as to know the divine mind

25:55.513 --> 25:57.098
that guides all things?

26:02.270 --> 26:05.064
<i>Friends, when I saw that deer,</i>

26:05.231 --> 26:07.066
<i>I knew it not for a deer,</i>

26:08.609 --> 26:14.031
but as Christ, who had taken that
shape to show us that He was with us,

26:16.075 --> 26:18.452
that He would not abandon us
on this day.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.005
King Harald,

26:29.297 --> 26:31.048
why is the ground burned?

26:32.842 --> 26:34.552
Why is the ground burned?

26:36.304 --> 26:38.306
Why is the ground burned?

26:44.520 --> 26:45.980
For Wessex!

27:10.504 --> 27:11.631
Let us pray.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.428
"Unto thee, O Lord,
I lift up my soul.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.307
"O my God, I trust in thee.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.268
"Let me not be ashamed.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.063
"Let not mine enemies
triumph over me.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.024
"Lead me in thy truth,

27:30.983 --> 27:33.319
"for thou art the God
of my salvation.

27:34.862 --> 27:35.988
"On thee do I wait

27:37.114 --> 27:38.115
"all the day."

27:42.328 --> 27:43.329
Amen.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.435
To battle!

28:06.852 --> 28:10.731
For Christ, for Wessex, and for England!

28:14.318 --> 28:15.319
Release!

29:28.934 --> 29:30.478
What's wrong with you?

29:31.312 --> 29:33.856
What's wrong with you?
The gods are watching.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.196
Don't you want
to go to Valhalla?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.575
You have no courage,

29:44.658 --> 29:46.577
and you will find no faith.

30:28.869 --> 30:29.954
Dear Lord,

30:32.206 --> 30:33.791
the pagans had the best of it.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.835
The King lives!

31:20.087 --> 31:21.505
Long live the king.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.680
Yet the battle
still hung in the balance.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.469
The great warrior Heahmund,

32:09.762 --> 32:11.930
staunch defender of our faith.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.151
Lageflha!

33:25.879 --> 33:28.841
Lageflha!

34:03.959 --> 34:04.960
<i>Alas!</i>

34:06.003 --> 34:08.922
We have suffered
a most grievous loss

34:09.006 --> 34:11.133
of this great and noble man.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.721
Bishop Heahmund,

34:18.974 --> 34:21.393
he rests at peace now with God.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.566
We mourn his passing, but we know that
he has gone to a far better place.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.032
No one else will ever be fit
to carry his sword,

34:37.242 --> 34:38.827
Which will be buried With him.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.998
God bless and keep him.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.379
And God bless Wessex,
for which he died.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.401
<i>ALFRED“.
And when King Harald</i>

35:52.484 --> 35:55.070
<i>urged his devils
to run from the fields,</i>

35:56.238 --> 35:59.992
I knew then
with a beautiful certainty

36:00.284 --> 36:03.537
that the day and the battle
had belonged to us.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.844
But without our Viking allies,

36:21.597 --> 36:22.723
I swear to you,

36:23.599 --> 36:25.726
there could be
no victory either.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.565
Without these Norsemen,
who have embraced our cause

36:31.648 --> 36:32.774
and our God.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.047
I think I have found her.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.218
This is not her.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.724
My mother always carried Thor's
hammer around her waist.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.150
I don't think
we are going to find her.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.589
More!

37:37.798 --> 37:39.132
More wine!

37:44.846 --> 37:46.974
Brother, you need to relax.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.942
No one saw her die.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.695
No one has seen her body.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.201
She must be alive

38:07.077 --> 38:08.120
somewhere.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.165
You think she loved him?

38:12.874 --> 38:13.917
Did he love her?

38:14.626 --> 38:17.295
Nobody knows the secrets of
other people's relationships.

38:17.379 --> 38:18.797
We only think we do.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.805
I hope he did.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.522
Heave!

38:36.023 --> 38:37.858
Heave!

38:37.941 --> 38:39.609
Heave!

38:41.111 --> 38:42.904
Hail Ivar.

38:44.614 --> 38:45.657
All hail Ivar.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.367
How is Balder? Hmm?

38:48.493 --> 38:49.703
He is well.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.247
He cannot wait to be born.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.044
I love you.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.880
And I love you.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.716
Apart from my mother,

39:03.884 --> 39:06.803
I've never really known
what it is to be loved

39:06.887 --> 39:09.097
or truly love.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.019
My father left me outside
to die when I was a baby

39:14.895 --> 39:16.938
because I was a cripple.

39:18.565 --> 39:22.527
Everyone has always treated me
first as a cripple.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.573
All I ever wanted
was for them to love me.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.828
But I saw it was impossible,

39:32.996 --> 39:34.915
so I was angry with everyone.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.294
I've been in rage all my life

39:43.799 --> 39:44.800
until now.

39:47.219 --> 39:48.762
You expect nothing for yourself,

39:48.845 --> 39:50.722
but you revealed
everything to me.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.101
You are all goodness.

39:56.686 --> 39:57.687
AII truth.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.482
And you're all the world to me.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.193
I'm glad.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.488
But just imagine.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.574
I was a slave.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.036
But now,

40:13.995 --> 40:15.914
I carry in my body

40:18.041 --> 40:19.501
the son of a god.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.180
Mmm.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.850
I've been wondering
about something.

40:35.809 --> 40:38.436
Hmm?
What do gods do. hmm?

40:38.854 --> 40:40.522
I have to do something.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.649
I have to do more.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.527
I need to do more.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.988
I'm sure you're right.

40:49.156 --> 40:50.824
But what you have to do

40:50.907 --> 40:52.909
will surely be revealed
to you in time.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.538
The Aesirwill send a messenger.

40:57.914 --> 41:01.668
The Valkyries will descend,
beating their luminous wings.

41:02.419 --> 41:03.753
And you will hear them,

41:06.756 --> 41:07.966
and you will know.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.892
All hail Ivar.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.645
Hail Ivar.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.398
Alfred.

41:28.612 --> 41:29.821
You need to hear me.

41:31.573 --> 41:34.242
Mother, I am so tired.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.203
Can't you imagine?

41:38.079 --> 41:40.332
Better to be tired and alive

41:41.499 --> 41:43.335
than sleeping in the earth.

41:47.047 --> 41:48.256
I don't understand.

41:49.466 --> 41:50.675
What do you mean?

41:51.551 --> 41:54.095
The conspiracy against you,

41:55.805 --> 41:59.100
those who wish to overthrow
and kill you,

42:00.310 --> 42:02.020
I know their names.

42:05.649 --> 42:06.650
Good.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.320
Then we can arrest
and hang them.

42:16.618 --> 42:17.827
Aethelred

42:19.037 --> 42:20.330
is their leader.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.994
Ah.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.788
Magnus, son of Ragnar.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.961
What is to become
of us now, huh?

43:17.971 --> 43:19.806
I have faith
that we shall prevail.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.517
No doubt at all.

43:24.436 --> 43:28.773
Our gods will ultimately triumph
over the Christian God,

43:30.108 --> 43:31.484
who's a usurper,

43:32.652 --> 43:34.446
who has no meaning,

43:36.448 --> 43:37.824
who's not real.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.287
And one day, not so far away,

43:43.580 --> 43:44.998
the name Jesus Christ

43:45.498 --> 43:48.168
will be utterly forgotten.
