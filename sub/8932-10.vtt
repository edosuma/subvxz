00:01.534 --> 00:02.068
Sit, Sir Bert, shining

00:02.068 --> 00:04.037
Sit, Sir Bert,
shining knight

00:04.037 --> 00:06.773
of the Evergreen Forest!

00:06.773 --> 00:09.676
These woods aren't big
enough for the both of us.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.944
Uaaaah!
This is the moment

00:10.944 --> 00:14.614
Sneers have waited
lifetimes for!

00:14.614 --> 00:16.349
Nothing can stop

00:16.349 --> 00:18.885
Sir Cyril Sneer!

00:20.987 --> 00:21.421
This is the

00:21.421 --> 00:22.756
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.825
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.363
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.998
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.466 --> 00:35.568
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.369 --> 00:37.370
Yikes!

00:38.104 --> 00:39.506
Yaaaah...

00:42.008 --> 00:43.710
Yeaaaah!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.513
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.289
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:57.991 --> 00:59.426
Cyril Sneer!

01:02.996 --> 01:05.198
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:05.932 --> 01:07.600
the Raccoons!!

01:07.600 --> 01:11.137
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:23.316 --> 01:25.085
On a perfect
summer morning,

01:25.085 --> 01:27.020
Cedric and Sophia
peddled their way

01:27.020 --> 01:28.555
through the Evergreen Forest.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.290
Enjoying the beauty of the day.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.060
Hmm, what a
day for a ride, Cedric!

01:34.060 --> 01:36.096
It sure is, Sophia!

01:36.096 --> 01:40.166
Hey, why don't we go
call on Ralph and Melissa?

01:40.166 --> 01:41.734
Great idea!

01:41.734 --> 01:44.070
I'll race you to
the raccoon-dominium.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.473
Okay!

01:49.409 --> 01:51.911
I have the
most wonderful news.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.547
The Royal family is
coming to our forest.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.451
(chuckles) You're
too fast for me, Sophia.

02:00.553 --> 02:01.988
Ssshh!
The Royal family?!

02:01.988 --> 02:03.823
How soon do they arrive?

02:04.824 --> 02:06.025
Tomorrow at dusk,

02:06.025 --> 02:08.328
but it must be kept a secret.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.997
A secret?! Why?

02:10.997 --> 02:13.500
They're coming to
bestow a special honor

02:13.500 --> 02:15.001
on one of our own.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.569
It's to be a surprise.

02:18.104 --> 02:21.441
Royalty coming
to the Evergreen Forest!

02:21.441 --> 02:23.943
How absolutely thrilling!

02:23.943 --> 02:26.012
Oh, I can't wait to tell...

02:26.012 --> 02:28.481
You can't
tell anyone, Sophia.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.450
You heard what Melissa said.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.285
It's a secret!

02:32.285 --> 02:34.954
Oh, this is so exciting!

02:34.954 --> 02:38.124
Come on, Cedric. We've got
to get ready for this.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.826
We don't have a lot of time.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.061
I've got to get
my best dress out,

02:42.061 --> 02:44.330
and I must get my hair done.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.299
They're going to be here soon!

02:46.299 --> 02:48.668
Hey, wait for me!

02:51.371 --> 02:53.540
Look Ralph,
there's Cedric and Sophia.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.874
They could have overheard us.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
We've got to
be more careful.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.347
Yeah, we're
keeping a secret

03:01.347 --> 03:03.316
that just can't get out!

03:08.521 --> 03:08.988
We've gotta get to

03:08.988 --> 03:11.558
We've gotta get
to Pop's library, Sophia.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.892
What for?!

03:12.892 --> 03:16.663
Research! What
do we know about royalty?

03:16.663 --> 03:19.399
Well, I do
know we have to curtsy

03:19.399 --> 03:20.867
and I know we have to...

03:20.867 --> 03:22.235
Watch out for...

03:22.235 --> 03:23.269
Hey!!

03:30.843 --> 03:32.812
I'm Okay.

03:35.548 --> 03:39.052
Hey! Where were you two
off to in such a hurry?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.254
We are going to
prepare for the arrival

03:41.254 --> 03:43.256
of the King and Queen!

03:43.256 --> 03:45.558
They're coming to
the Evergreen Forest!

03:45.558 --> 03:48.728
But we can't tell you that
because it's a secret.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.832
Oops!

03:52.832 --> 03:54.701
The King and Queen?!

03:54.701 --> 03:56.736
Coming to the Evergreen Forest?!

03:56.736 --> 03:59.005
Uugh?!
Oh, yes!

03:59.005 --> 04:01.975
We overheard Ralph and
Melissa talking about it,

04:01.975 --> 04:04.544
but you can't tell anyone!

04:05.178 --> 04:08.615
My lips
are royally sealed.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.551
We hate to
rush off, Bert,

04:11.551 --> 04:13.386
but we've got a lot to do.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.054
See you later!

04:15.054 --> 04:16.823
Bye-bye!
Bye.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.424
Wow!

04:18.424 --> 04:22.195
The King and Queen
coming to our forest!

04:22.195 --> 04:24.197
I bet they'll bring
the whole Royal Court,

04:24.197 --> 04:25.932
full of Dukes and Duchesses,

04:25.932 --> 04:27.567
and a whole bunch of knights.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.069
And... knights!!

04:30.069 --> 04:32.272
I've always dreamed
of being a knight.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.909
This is my big chance
to get knighted.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.579
Think of it!

04:39.579 --> 04:41.214
I dub thee

04:41.214 --> 04:43.916
Sir Bert Raccoon

04:43.916 --> 04:46.786
knight and protector

04:46.786 --> 04:50.256
of the Evergreen Forest.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.532
Woof-woof!

05:02.168 --> 05:04.704
Everything we need
to know about royalty,

05:04.704 --> 05:06.973
should be right here, Sophia.

05:06.973 --> 05:11.044
Look, the complete
works of William Shakesneer!

05:11.044 --> 05:12.812
And the Sneer Dynasty?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.648
 The Sneer Coat of Arms.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.152
Emily Aardvark's etiquette book?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.754
Pop's always
been keen on Royalty,

05:21.754 --> 05:24.824
on account of there being
blue blood in the family.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.561
Cedric,
you have a royal ancestor?!

05:28.561 --> 05:32.498
Uh-huh! Pop's
great-great-great uncle

05:32.498 --> 05:34.701
Excalibur Sneer.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.137
Here's the sword, he was
knighted with.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.273
(gasps) Oooh!

05:40.273 --> 05:41.674
Unfortunately,

05:41.674 --> 05:44.711
Excalibur Sneer
fell into disfavor,

05:44.711 --> 05:47.246
and the title was
taken away from him,

05:47.246 --> 05:50.283
on account of his evil ways.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.453
Oh, goodness!

05:53.453 --> 05:54.654
What did he do?

05:54.654 --> 05:57.123
He was caught
stealing the crown jewels.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.125
(gasps) Really?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.527
But Pop's
convinced that someday

06:01.527 --> 06:05.498
the Royal Family will realize
it's made a big mistake,

06:05.498 --> 06:09.769
and restore the title
to the name of Sneer.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.271
What's going on here?

06:12.271 --> 06:15.675
Uhm, would you believe
a haircut?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.478
Not too much off
the sides now, Sophia!

06:18.478 --> 06:20.079
Why aren't you
working in the vault?

06:20.079 --> 06:22.115
The stock exchange is booming.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.883
This is no time to goof off.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.252
What have we got here?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.655
The Sneer Dynasty?!

06:30.156 --> 06:31.691
The Sneer Dynasty?

06:31.691 --> 06:33.259
What do you want with this?

06:33.259 --> 06:34.961
Well, Pop.. it's um...

06:36.229 --> 06:38.364
It's the Royal Family, Pop!

06:38.364 --> 06:40.800
They're coming to
the Evergreen Forest.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.770
Cedric, that's
a secret, remember?!?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.505
Ohh...

06:45.505 --> 06:47.407
What?! Royalty??

06:47.407 --> 06:48.841
Here?

06:48.841 --> 06:50.710
Are they running
out of places to go?

06:50.710 --> 06:53.112
Gosh, Pop, I don't know

06:53.112 --> 06:56.582
But if they're coming,
it must be something important.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.085
Important?!

06:59.385 --> 07:00.453
Hmmm...

07:01.287 --> 07:03.790
Here?...Of course!

07:03.790 --> 07:05.458
Um,
what's that, Pop?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.894
Nothing!
You two run along now?

07:07.894 --> 07:11.397
You must have a million things
to do before they arrive.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.766
Why, Sophia? Won't you have to

07:13.766 --> 07:16.135
get out your
best dress or something?

07:16.135 --> 07:19.238
Hah! Get a move on now!
I've got work to do.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.843
This is an historic moment.

07:23.843 --> 07:28.714
This is the moment, Sneers
have waited lifetimes for!

07:28.714 --> 07:30.249
The Pigs: What's that, Sir?!

07:30.249 --> 07:33.586
The restoration
of the Sneer title!

07:33.586 --> 07:36.989
Taken years ago from
my great-great uncle,

07:36.989 --> 07:38.958
Excalibur Sneer.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.161
Imagine disgracing our
family the way he did!

07:42.995 --> 07:44.430
Getting caught!

07:44.430 --> 07:46.666
The Pigs: Oh no, Sir!

07:46.666 --> 07:48.301
I want you
to get out there,

07:48.301 --> 07:51.704
and find out all you can
about this Royal visit!

07:51.704 --> 07:52.738
The Pigs: Yes, Sir!

07:52.738 --> 07:54.674
And don't get caught!

07:54.674 --> 07:56.075
The Pigs: No, Sir.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.446
So now the Crown
has seen the light.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.983
Our good name is being restored.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.152
Sir Cyril Sneer!

08:08.488 --> 08:10.790
With titles come riches,

08:10.790 --> 08:13.292
with riches comes power!

08:13.292 --> 08:16.762
The absolute power
is Lord and Master

08:16.762 --> 08:19.031
of the Evergreen Forest!

08:19.031 --> 08:22.869
And everyone will bow
and scrape before me.

08:22.869 --> 08:26.172
Nothing can stop me now!

08:26.172 --> 08:28.708
Sir Cyril Sneer!

08:28.708 --> 08:31.177
Ha-haaa, Ha-haaaa!

08:33.045 --> 08:33.546
As the word of a

08:33.546 --> 08:35.181
As the word of
a big event spread quickly

08:35.181 --> 08:36.516
through the Evergreen Forest,

08:36.516 --> 08:38.417
everyone prepared themself,

08:38.417 --> 08:40.486
including Bert Raccoon.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.022
Being of sharp mind

08:43.022 --> 08:45.591
and awesome body,

08:45.591 --> 08:47.627
I gratuitously accept

08:47.627 --> 08:50.596
with munificence and humidity,

08:50.596 --> 08:54.734
the honor of your knighthood.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.271
Oh!

08:58.271 --> 09:00.172
Uh-ah-uh... hi, guys.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.177
Sophia/Cedric:

09:05.177 --> 09:07.380
I was just getting
ready for my ceremony.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.248
What ceremony?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.950
For my knighting!

09:10.950 --> 09:13.686
Bert, you
expect to be knighted?

09:13.686 --> 09:16.255
Oh, yeah, of course!

09:16.255 --> 09:18.925
With the Royal
Family coming here,

09:18.925 --> 09:21.727
this is my big chance!

09:21.727 --> 09:24.530
Can you think of anyone
in the whole forest,

09:24.530 --> 09:28.234
who would make a braver
and bolder knight than me?

09:28.701 --> 09:29.902
Think of it!

09:29.902 --> 09:32.738
Sir Bert Raccoon,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.540
ace knight...

09:34.540 --> 09:37.810
But Bert, you don't
look anything like a knight.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.846
Oh well, what's
a knight look like?

09:40.846 --> 09:41.981
Like this!!

09:43.282 --> 09:44.784
Heeeeyyy!

09:44.784 --> 09:46.886
That's what I need.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.588
That suit!

09:48.588 --> 09:51.924
But it's not the suit
that makes the knight, Bert!

09:51.924 --> 09:53.059
What do you mean?!

09:53.059 --> 09:55.361
You have to go
through a rite of passage

09:55.361 --> 09:57.163
before you can become a knight.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.466
You know, you have
to prove you're brave.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.603
Brave?! Why, you know
there's no braver person

10:03.603 --> 10:05.104
in the forest than me!

10:07.873 --> 10:08.841
Uhm, let's see.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.544
Rights of passage,

10:11.544 --> 10:14.246
the test of a true knight.

10:15.181 --> 10:19.485
One, obtain a shield
and a sword.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.821
Two, tame a foul beast

10:21.821 --> 10:24.290
and pluck a hair from its mane.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.325
Three, ford a river,

10:26.325 --> 10:27.994
climb the highest mountain,

10:27.994 --> 10:31.731
and obtain the most precious
object in the Kingdom.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.000
Wow! Becoming a knight

10:34.000 --> 10:37.336
is a lot more work
than I expected.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.606
But if anybody
can do it, it's me!

10:40.606 --> 10:42.842
Shhh, it's
Ralph and Melissa.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.479
Remember, we can't let on
that we know the secret.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.650
Hey! What are
you guys doing here?

10:51.017 --> 10:53.786
We're waiting for...

10:54.487 --> 10:55.721
...a bus!!

10:56.422 --> 10:58.324
(giggles) A bus?!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.860
No bus has ever
passed here.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.795
You know, I thought
we'd been waiting

11:02.795 --> 11:04.330
an awfully long time.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.700
What are you two doing?

11:07.700 --> 11:10.770
We're checking out
the Forest Bowl, Sophia,

11:10.770 --> 11:13.706
to see if it's right for
a very special presentation.

11:14.874 --> 11:19.078
What sort of special
presentation would that be?

11:19.078 --> 11:22.682
Well, come to the Forest
Bowl at six o'clock tonight,

11:22.682 --> 11:23.816
and you'll find out.

11:23.816 --> 11:26.485
We're sure you'll
be pleasantly surprised.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.454
Be sure
to pass the word.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.557
Oh, we will!
Don't you worry.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.659
Bye now.
Bye!

11:35.261 --> 11:36.762
This is
perfect, Ralph.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.498
The Royal dresses and
crowns will look great

11:39.498 --> 11:40.900
in this setting tonight.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.070
I just hope I get
the King's entrance right.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.038
Pig 1: Uuuh, did you hear that?

11:46.038 --> 11:49.041
Pig 2: Crowns, Royal dresses,

11:49.041 --> 11:50.743
Kings...

11:50.743 --> 11:52.578
...tonight. Oh!

11:52.578 --> 11:54.180
Ay! Uuuh!

11:54.180 --> 11:56.048
We'd better go
and tell the boss.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.350
This is what he's been
waiting for.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.252
Let's go!

12:17.136 --> 12:19.238
Can't you
Bears speed it up?

12:19.238 --> 12:21.607
If you were any slower,
you'd be unionized!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.714
I want this mansion

12:28.714 --> 12:31.751
to make the Taj Mahal
look like a tool shed!!

12:34.053 --> 12:35.955
Because from now on,

12:35.955 --> 12:37.423
this place is going to be

12:37.423 --> 12:39.258
the home of Royalty.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.598
You bumblers!

12:45.598 --> 12:47.967
I want to impress
the King and Queen,

12:47.967 --> 12:49.602
not scare them away!

12:50.002 --> 12:53.105
Pig 3: Sir Sir,
the Royal Family,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.640
they're coming here tonight!

12:54.640 --> 12:56.542
What?! So soon??

12:56.542 --> 12:58.210
The Pig 2: And
that's not all, Sir!

12:58.210 --> 13:01.981
Bert Raccoon, he intends
to be... knighted!

13:01.981 --> 13:03.282
What?!?

13:03.282 --> 13:06.118
Pig 1: He's going through the
rites of passage now, Sir.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.088
To take your honor away...

13:09.088 --> 13:10.923
We'll see about that!!

13:10.923 --> 13:12.258
Hmm...

13:12.258 --> 13:15.394
So that meddlesome
raccoon is off

13:15.394 --> 13:18.631
robbing me of what's
rightfully mine, is he?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.466
This calls for action!!

13:20.466 --> 13:23.969
Pig 1: But Sir, what about
the rites of passage?

13:23.969 --> 13:27.940
Ha! Oh, I'll do them!

16:37.596 --> 16:39.865
Heyyy! Give me my stuff back!

16:40.532 --> 16:44.269
Forget it!
We both know the royal rule.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.538
Only one knight per forest.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.375
These woods aren't big enough
for the both of us.

17:04.456 --> 17:06.358
It's ungentlemanly!

17:06.358 --> 17:08.494
It's poor sportsmanship!

this is so exciting!

17:34.186 --> 17:36.188

Those under handed raccoons,

19:00.272 --> 19:02.174
they've set me up!

19:02.174 --> 19:04.009
I knew it from the start!

19:04.009 --> 19:05.644
This was all a plot!

19:05.644 --> 19:07.112
A dirty trick!

19:07.112 --> 19:08.981
Ah, that's your queue,

Hey, stop pushing!

Aaaah!

19:19.024 --> 19:20.425
What's going on here?

19:20.425 --> 19:22.494
I don't know, Ralph.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.930
But make like it's
part of the play.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.633
The show must go on.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.904
I have the most wonderful news.

19:31.904 --> 19:35.941
The Royal Family is
coming to our forest.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.843
The Royal Family?!

19:37.843 --> 19:40.012
Coming to our forest?!

19:40.012 --> 19:42.214
How soon do they arrive?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.817
Cyril Uh, uhm... I don't know.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.020
They, they should be
here in a few minutes,

19:48.020 --> 19:51.456
unless they they stopped for
some last minute shopping.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.791
What?!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.227
Ugh, last minute shopping?!

19:55.227 --> 19:57.062
They're
coming to bestow

19:57.062 --> 19:59.665
a special honor
on one of our own.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.833
It's to be a surprise!

20:01.833 --> 20:03.435
You're telling me.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.737
Uh-oh-uh...
what brings you,

20:05.737 --> 20:08.473
Fahrenheit, to our forest?

20:08.473 --> 20:10.375
I was just
in the neighborhood.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.178
I.. I, um.. I just
thought I'd drop by.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.687
What's going on, guys?

20:23.555 --> 20:27.693
It's all been a big
misunderstanding, Bert.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.162
The King and Queen
aren't really coming.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.365
Ralph and Melissa are
just putting on a play.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.666
A play?!?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.703
You mean that this
was all a play?!

20:37.703 --> 20:38.971
Phew!

20:38.971 --> 20:41.273
This could have been embarrassing.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.375
(chuckles) It is!

20:43.375 --> 20:45.110
Look at Pop.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.347
Gentle, Sir.

20:49.881 --> 20:53.218
Have you brought a gift
for this great occasion?

20:53.218 --> 20:55.053
What?! Um...

20:55.587 --> 20:57.956
Yes, I've brought
with me the most

20:57.956 --> 20:59.758
precious object in the Kingdom.

21:24.416 --> 21:28.220
Bert/Cedric:

21:28.220 --> 21:31.723
What a... what a waste
of my vintage peanut butter.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.326
But it's worth it!

21:38.263 --> 21:39.665
That evening,
Ralph and Melissa

21:39.665 --> 21:42.267
presented their play to an
appreciative audience.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.038
And Cedric and Sophia enjoyed
themselves just as much

21:46.038 --> 21:48.707
as if the King and Queen had
actually been there.

21:49.408 --> 21:50.642
And As for Bert and Cyril,

21:50.642 --> 21:52.844
they discovered
when you mix a rumor

21:52.844 --> 21:54.913
with a little too much imagination,

21:54.913 --> 21:57.149
the plot can have
an unexpected ending.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.689
Well, where is it?

22:04.790 --> 22:06.291
Here it is, Sir.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.963

22:16.668 --> 22:19.638
Pig 1: You're a star, Sir.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.874
As well, his performance
was one of the most

22:22.874 --> 22:26.144
consistent this
reporters ever seen.

The Pig 2: A rave, Sir,

Pig 1: Wait, there's more.

22:32.818 --> 22:36.888
Mr. Sneer's utterly
ridiculous debut...

22:36.888 --> 22:39.558
uh, will be remembered forever

22:39.558 --> 22:42.327
for the consistent flow of tears

22:42.327 --> 22:45.230
it brought to laughing
patrons' eyes.
