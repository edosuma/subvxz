<i>Previously on</i>
The Amazing Race...

00:03.586 --> 00:04.896
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:07.724
<i>teams raced
to the Kingdom of Jordan.</i>

00:07.827 --> 00:09.724
- <i>
- Is that real
or are we seeing things?</i>

00:09.827 --> 00:12.655
<i>And early injuries
slowed down Emily and Molly.</i>

00:12.758 --> 00:14.344
I've got something
going on with my thigh.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.137
- Oh, no.
- This is not good.

00:16.241 --> 00:17.344
<i>At the Roadblock,</i>

00:17.448 --> 00:19.103
<i>Linton struggled in the sand.</i>

00:19.206 --> 00:20.310
No giving up. No giving up.

00:20.413 --> 00:22.068
It's out here somewhere.

00:22.172 --> 00:25.344
<i>In the ancient city of Petra,
Derek and Claire</i>

00:25.448 --> 00:27.793
<i>and Luis and Michelle
battled for the lead.</i>

00:27.896 --> 00:30.068
- Oh, we got it!
- They got it?

00:30.172 --> 00:32.724
<i>Ending with a victory
for the married couple.</i>

00:32.827 --> 00:34.689
- You are team number one.
- Yes!

00:36.551 --> 00:39.137
<i>Aubrey and David
were puzzled at the Detour.</i>

00:39.241 --> 00:40.241
No?

00:42.344 --> 00:43.655
<i>But in the end,</i>

00:43.758 --> 00:46.310
<i>it was Linton and Sharik
who came up short.</i>

00:46.413 --> 00:47.724
You are the last team to arrive.

00:47.827 --> 00:50.068
You have been eliminated
from the race.

00:50.172 --> 00:51.413
- Thank you.
- Very proud of her.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.586
- Thank you.
- We finished what we started.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
This is the capital of Jordan, Amman.

00:59.103 --> 01:02.655
First inhabited
about 9,000 years ago,

01:02.758 --> 01:05.344
it's among
the world's oldest cities.

01:05.448 --> 01:07.689
And high atop the white city,

01:07.793 --> 01:09.551
these ancient ruins,

01:09.655 --> 01:12.517
including the Citadel.

01:12.620 --> 01:16.241
<i>This is where teams will begin
their second leg in Jordan.</i>

01:24.827 --> 01:26.103
Morning, everybody.

01:26.206 --> 01:27.241
Good morning, Phil.

01:27.344 --> 01:29.000
<i>Whenever you see Phil</i>

01:29.103 --> 01:30.586
<i>before a leg starts,</i>

01:30.689 --> 01:31.724
that's not good.

01:31.827 --> 01:33.827
Good to see everyone,

01:33.931 --> 01:36.620
but I do have some
important news to share.

01:36.724 --> 01:37.827
You will have noticed
that there's a team

01:37.931 --> 01:39.068
missing this morning.

01:40.103 --> 01:41.413
Abby and Will.

01:41.517 --> 01:44.172
Good morning, Abby and Will.

01:44.275 --> 01:45.827
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Phil.

01:47.379 --> 01:49.862
Unfortunately, we have received

01:49.965 --> 01:52.689
a positive COVID test from you.

01:53.724 --> 01:56.620
As you know, safety is
our number-one priority, and...

01:57.689 --> 02:00.068
...I'm really sorry to say this,
but it does mean

02:00.172 --> 02:02.344
that you are
officially eliminated

02:02.448 --> 02:03.827
from <i>The Amazing Race.</i>

02:04.896 --> 02:06.482
We understand.

02:06.586 --> 02:09.172
We knew it was gonna
be a challenge coming back out

02:09.275 --> 02:12.172
on the race, having to deal
with COVID protocols.

02:12.275 --> 02:14.758
<i>Amazing Race</i> is kind of
rolling with the punches,

02:14.862 --> 02:17.310
and unfortunately,
this is one of the punches.

02:17.413 --> 02:18.931
<i>So it's definitely heartbreaking,</i>

02:19.034 --> 02:21.793
<i>but we've loved
every single minute of it.</i>

02:21.896 --> 02:24.655
It has been
everything I dreamed.

02:25.758 --> 02:26.689
<i>I'm really devastated</i>

02:26.793 --> 02:28.827
by this. I loved Abby and Will.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.241
They are great people,

02:30.344 --> 02:32.379
<i>and they're
really fierce competitors.</i>

02:32.482 --> 02:33.827
<i>- Yeah.
- And so seeing them
be taken out</i>

02:33.931 --> 02:36.586
<i>by something that
is kind of out of their control,</i>

02:36.689 --> 02:37.689
<i>it does break your heart.</i>

02:37.793 --> 02:39.172
I'm gonna be forever grateful

02:39.275 --> 02:40.413
that I had a chance
to run this with Abby.

02:40.517 --> 02:41.862
<i>We had so much fun together,</i>

02:41.965 --> 02:44.275
<i>and just getting to see
all these amazing places</i>

02:44.379 --> 02:45.344
was incredible.

02:45.448 --> 02:46.862
We're gonna miss you guys.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.413
- We love you. Miss you.
- I love you, Will and Abby.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.931
Good luck.

02:51.034 --> 02:53.241
We hope to see y'all,
uh, at the end of the race.

02:53.344 --> 02:54.344
Take care.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.137
That's pretty tough, huh?

02:58.620 --> 03:00.482
But you guys
get to continue racing.

03:00.586 --> 03:02.310
That is the good news.

03:02.413 --> 03:05.103
So I need you
to shift your minds right now.

03:05.206 --> 03:06.931
Just because
of the circumstances

03:07.034 --> 03:08.310
of what's happened here,

03:08.413 --> 03:10.172
we're all gonna be leaving
at the same time,

03:10.275 --> 03:12.655
and you don't have
to worry about an elimination.

03:12.758 --> 03:14.275
We've already eliminated a team.

03:14.379 --> 03:17.655
But I want you to know that
the way you finish in this leg

03:17.758 --> 03:21.827
will determine how you start
in the leg after this one.

03:21.931 --> 03:25.862
You will be leaving in the next
leg of the race in four groups.

03:25.965 --> 03:27.551
Two teams in the first group,

03:27.655 --> 03:29.758
two teams in the second group,
two in the third.

03:29.862 --> 03:34.068
And then one team will be
leaving all on their own...

03:35.137 --> 03:38.413
...45 minutes
behind the first team.

03:39.482 --> 03:42.517
So give it absolutely
everything you can today.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.034
Everybody ready to race?

03:44.137 --> 03:45.344
All right.

03:45.448 --> 03:48.310
Your first clue
is inside the Citadel.

03:48.413 --> 03:52.034
When I say go, run down,
go inside, grab a clue.

03:52.137 --> 03:54.896
Good luck. Travel safe.

03:58.551 --> 04:00.172
Go!

04:17.241 --> 04:18.793
Let's do it.

04:19.689 --> 04:21.068
"Route Info.

04:21.172 --> 04:22.620
<i>"You will be exploring
this historic city</i>

04:22.724 --> 04:24.275

04:27.413 --> 04:28.655
<i>to find your next clue."</i>

04:28.758 --> 04:30.000
We got to turn it on
for this race.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.413
Got to find this bookstore.
Let's go.

04:32.517 --> 04:35.034
Let's keep this in our hands
as long as we need it, you know?

04:35.137 --> 04:37.448
<i>We wanted this to be our leg</i>

04:37.551 --> 04:40.931
<i>and finally
get ahead of the pack.</i>

04:41.034 --> 04:42.551
We were seventh place last leg.

04:42.655 --> 04:45.000
<i>So when Phil talked about
the fact that we were all gonna</i>

04:45.103 --> 04:47.172
<i>do another sprint,
we were hopeful,</i>

04:47.275 --> 04:49.448
because it's just what we wanted
and just what we needed.

04:49.551 --> 04:51.310
I'll run
as long as you run, baby.

04:51.413 --> 04:53.000
- You set the pace.
- I'll tell you when to stop.

05:09.172 --> 05:13.103
Anyone know the Maktabet
Khazanet Al-Jahith Bookstore?

05:13.206 --> 05:15.379
- Uh, not really.
- No, so that's probably not it.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.482
Do you have a cell phone?

05:17.862 --> 05:19.241
Hey, let's ask
some of the tourists.

05:19.344 --> 05:21.172
Yeah, excuse me?
Did we ask you already?

05:21.275 --> 05:23.310
Let's ask in there.
Come on, baby.

05:24.310 --> 05:25.310
This way? To the left?

05:26.758 --> 05:28.137
Is that the correct one?

05:28.241 --> 05:29.241
Yeah.

05:29.344 --> 05:30.827
You happen to know the address

05:30.931 --> 05:33.275
to the Maktabet
Al-Jahith Bookstore?

05:34.344 --> 05:35.551
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

05:35.655 --> 05:36.689
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

05:36.793 --> 05:38.551
We see 'em, we see 'em.

05:38.655 --> 05:39.896
We're just
gonna follow the brothers.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.068
They seem like they
know where they're going.

05:41.172 --> 05:42.896
- Yeah.
- This is a good plan. Good plan.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.655
<i>The order we finish today
determines the order</i>

05:45.758 --> 05:48.241
<i>and timing of our Pit Starts
for the next leg.</i>

05:48.344 --> 05:51.241
So we knew it's important
to finish as high as possible.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.586
Yo.

05:52.689 --> 05:54.551
It looks like everyone's
sticking in teams of two.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.413
- Yeah. Let's do it...
- You guys want
to do this together?

05:56.517 --> 05:58.103
We got two teams following us.

05:58.206 --> 06:01.034
So unless they're following us,
they're going towards it, too.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.241
<i>All right, guys, let's go.</i>

06:05.551 --> 06:07.241
- Down this hill.
- Getting to the city?

06:07.344 --> 06:08.655
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:08.758 --> 06:09.793
Where are we?

06:11.206 --> 06:13.241
- Now, can you do walking?
- How far of a walk is it?

06:13.344 --> 06:15.206
By walking, 15 minutes.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.586
- 15 minutes walking?
- Okay, 15 minutes.

06:16.689 --> 06:19.241
Babe, it's looking
like we're last. Let's go.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.103
Where can we
find this bookstore?

06:21.206 --> 06:22.448
- Maktabet?
- You know where it could be?

06:22.551 --> 06:23.620
Straight down?

06:23.724 --> 06:25.068
Oh, oh, to the right.

06:25.172 --> 06:27.137
I don't see
David and Aubrey anymore.

06:27.241 --> 06:28.620
And Derek and Claire.

06:28.724 --> 06:31.068
- Hoppity hop.
- Let's do this, guys.

06:31.172 --> 06:33.034
- This feels right to me.
- Yeah.

06:33.137 --> 06:34.758
Yeah, they're not there anymore.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.517
- They're
right in front of us.
- Oh, got it.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.586
We'll go down the stairs,
and then what?

06:39.689 --> 06:41.241
I don't know. That's the thing.

06:41.344 --> 06:43.275
My body is not
feeling great right now.

06:43.379 --> 06:45.862
<i>We're halfway through the race,
but I think that</i>

06:45.965 --> 06:48.862
I strained
my quad muscle in Italy.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.965
<i>So I was very nervous
coming into this leg.</i>

06:52.068 --> 06:54.344
It was really my goal today
to not be

06:54.448 --> 06:56.137
that last team
into the Pit Stop.

06:56.241 --> 06:59.137
<i>So we're gonna
keep on pushing through.</i>

06:59.241 --> 07:00.310
<i>No panic.</i>

07:00.413 --> 07:01.896
You guys see 'em?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.862
The city was this way.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.862
<i>The last leg we got first,</i>

07:05.965 --> 07:07.655
and I hope
we keep this momentum going.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.379
<i>We're officially going downhill.</i>

07:09.482 --> 07:11.413
<i>We're... we still kind of
don't know where we're going.</i>

07:11.517 --> 07:13.137
<i>Next leg,
there's gonna be one team</i>

07:13.241 --> 07:16.896
<i>that leaves last,
45 minutes after the first team.</i>

07:17.000 --> 07:19.551
- That's huge. We did not
want to be that last team.
- Yeah.

07:19.655 --> 07:22.793
- Are we running carelessly?
- We got this, baby. Don't worry.

07:22.896 --> 07:24.137
<i>We got this.</i>

07:25.379 --> 07:27.689
<i>- It's looking like
we're last place, babe.
- That's all right.</i>

07:27.793 --> 07:31.689
<i>Nothing is marked in any English
letters. It's all in Arabic.</i>

07:31.793 --> 07:34.689
<i>This is more difficult
than what it looks like.</i>

07:34.793 --> 07:37.275
Uh, anyone speak English
around here? We're really lost.

07:37.379 --> 07:38.379
Can we use your phone?

07:39.586 --> 07:41.482
<i>This city is crazy.
This is like New York City.</i>

07:41.586 --> 07:43.689
Don't feel good that
we don't see anyone else.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.275
Found it. Downtown Amman.

07:46.379 --> 07:48.206
- Will you type that
into the Google map?
- Yeah.

07:48.310 --> 07:49.482
The entrance is over there.

07:49.586 --> 07:51.000
Oh, the entrance. Okay.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.689
Around the corner?

07:52.793 --> 07:55.310
I think this is
the same alley, no?

07:55.413 --> 07:57.620
It might lead to it.

07:57.724 --> 07:59.310
<i>This is insane.</i>

07:59.413 --> 08:01.000
<i>This is insane.</i>

08:02.103 --> 08:03.448
- Go back up this way?
- Yes.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.931
Yeah, 15 minutes.

08:05.034 --> 08:06.758
What did they tell you guys?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.137
- He thinks it's up.
- He thinks
it's the opposite way.

08:08.241 --> 08:09.793
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.379
We're trying to find Maktabet
Khazanet Al-Jahith Bookstore.

08:13.482 --> 08:15.586
<i>You guys want to see
if we can use the computer?</i>

08:15.689 --> 08:17.344
- That's good idea.
- Hello? You speak English?

08:18.379 --> 08:19.827
Can we use your computer?

08:19.931 --> 08:21.862
Left, then right, okay?
It's up there, okay?

08:21.965 --> 08:23.827
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you so much.

08:23.931 --> 08:25.310
<i>Shukran.</i>

08:25.413 --> 08:27.482
I told you we were going
in the right direction, baby.

08:27.586 --> 08:30.068
<i>Can we see
step-by-step directions?</i>

08:30.172 --> 08:31.827
Yes. Yes.

08:31.931 --> 08:34.310
- Yes, walking. Coming up.
Walking? Walking?
- Uh, walking. Walking.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.103
<i>- Good job. Let's go.
- All right. All right, guys.</i>

08:36.206 --> 08:38.068
All right, let's try to make up
a little bit of time.

08:38.172 --> 08:40.137
We're going through this tunnel.
You do a fast walk, baby.

08:40.241 --> 08:41.655
My wife is a beast!

08:41.758 --> 08:44.241
Good job, baby. Good job.

08:44.344 --> 08:46.931
You're gonna turn right, opposite.

08:47.034 --> 08:48.793
- Turn right?
It's over there. Okay.
- Yes.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.586
- Is that it?
- Oh, I see it.

08:50.689 --> 08:52.103
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

08:52.206 --> 08:54.172
- Look for
a red and yellow.
- Yep.

08:54.275 --> 08:55.793
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

08:55.896 --> 08:57.206
- Good job.
- Good job. Good job.

08:58.206 --> 09:00.068
-"Detour."
- Aw, snap.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.413
"Step by Step
or Letter by Letter?"

09:04.000 --> 09:06.896
Dance is a universal language
of human expression.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.655
This Jordanian routine,
a flirt dance,

09:10.758 --> 09:15.103
is often performed
as a ritual before weddings.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.482
<i>Teams must get in step with
an instructor, then dress up</i>

09:21.586 --> 09:25.586
<i>and nail a performance of
the dance for their next clue.</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:29.689
The Middle East
is believed to be the place

09:29.793 --> 09:32.448
where written language
was first invented.

09:32.551 --> 09:36.517
Today, the Arabic alphabet
is the second-most

09:36.620 --> 09:40.068
widely used alphabetic
writing system in the world,

09:40.172 --> 09:42.517
made up of 28 letters,

09:42.620 --> 09:45.413
all of them consonants,
read from right to left.

09:45.517 --> 09:49.724
<i>Teams must memorize
all 28 letters</i>

09:49.827 --> 09:52.931
<i>and recite them
out loud for a clue.</i>

09:53.034 --> 09:55.103
Hey, girls, what are you doing?

09:55.206 --> 09:56.896
- Letter by Letter.
- She can't dance right now.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.172
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're doing
Letter by Letter, too.

09:58.275 --> 09:59.655
"Make your way to the Odeon

09:59.758 --> 10:01.931
located
next to Hashemite Plaza."

10:02.034 --> 10:04.000
- Go, go, go... <i>
- Shukran, shukran, shukran.</i>

10:05.689 --> 10:07.310
- Thank you, thank you.
- Nice.

10:07.413 --> 10:08.862
- Get the clue, Aubrey.
- All right, Claire,
get the clue.

10:08.965 --> 10:10.000
We'll check it together.

10:12.172 --> 10:13.241
"Detour. Step by Step
or Letter by Letter?"

10:13.344 --> 10:14.310
We're doing Step by Step.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.758
We're doing Letter by Letter.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.310
You good, Q? You got it?
I didn't see it.

10:17.413 --> 10:19.172
- This way.
- All right.

10:19.275 --> 10:22.931
That was clutch. We needed
that printout. That was smart.

10:23.034 --> 10:24.586
Baby, that looks
like a bookstore right there.

10:24.689 --> 10:27.965
That might be it, but it's
in Arabic. I don't know.

10:28.068 --> 10:30.000
That's it?
Thank you so much.

10:30.103 --> 10:31.379
- That's it.
That looks like it's it.
- That's it.

10:31.482 --> 10:33.379
Come on. Hallelujah.

10:33.482 --> 10:35.379
- That was hard.
- It was.

10:36.379 --> 10:38.965
Sorry. Hello.

10:39.068 --> 10:40.310
-"Detour."
-"Detour."

10:40.413 --> 10:41.931
<i>Let's do Step by Step.</i>

10:42.034 --> 10:43.206
- All right.
- Step by Step.

10:44.206 --> 10:47.172
"Step by Step or Letter
by Letter? Learn to dance."

10:47.275 --> 10:48.655
- Learn to dance.
- Let's go.

10:48.758 --> 10:50.724
We're dancing. We're dancing.

10:53.551 --> 10:54.965
<i>Is it in there?</i>

10:55.068 --> 10:57.103
I-I see,
I see signs that say "theater."

10:57.206 --> 10:58.689
I think maybe inside, over here?

10:58.793 --> 11:00.034
Yeah.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.586
Do I see a door open?

11:01.689 --> 11:03.379
Oh, alphabet.
Pick an instructor.

11:03.482 --> 11:06.068
<i>Ah. Hello. We choose you?</i>

11:08.172 --> 11:10.000
Rahaf? Rahaf.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.275
<i>- Alif.</i>
- <i>Alif.</i>

11:11.379 --> 11:12.517
<i>- Baa.</i>
- <i>Baa.</i>

11:12.620 --> 11:14.000
<i>- Taa.</i>
- <i>Taa.</i>

11:14.103 --> 11:16.620
If you forget the three words,
you say "alphabet."

11:16.724 --> 11:18.137
<i>- Ayn.</i>
- "En."

11:18.241 --> 11:20.241
<i>- Ayn.</i>
- "En"?

11:20.344 --> 11:22.068
A...

11:22.172 --> 11:24.758
-"En. En." <i>
- Ayn. Ayn.</i>

11:24.862 --> 11:27.310
<i>- Raa.</i> Oh, my gosh. <i>
- Zaa.</i>

11:27.413 --> 11:29.206
<i>- Ghayn. Ghayn.
- Ghayn.</i>

11:29.310 --> 11:31.758
<i>- Kha. Kha.</i>
-"Waaf."

11:31.862 --> 11:33.310
"Waaf."

11:33.413 --> 11:34.551
Oh, my gosh.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.793
- We'll come back to that one.
- Yeah.

11:46.931 --> 11:48.586
<i>Okay. We need
to find an instructor.</i>

11:48.689 --> 11:51.655
<i>We get to Step by Step,
and we were the only team there.</i>

11:51.758 --> 11:53.655
- So I was like, "Perfect."
- Yeah.

12:32.344 --> 12:33.655
- We're ready.
- We're ready.

12:33.758 --> 12:36.241
- This dance
is a flirtatious dance...
- Oh.

12:36.344 --> 12:37.896
- Okay. Oh, all right.
- ...between a man and a woman.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.896
Usually done before a wedding.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.482
Done before weddings.

12:40.586 --> 12:42.758
- All right, all right.
It's a sign.
- It's a sign.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.827
- You're dancers, right?
It's a count of eight.
- Yes.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.827
<i>Typically in the other
dance challenges, I was able</i>

12:47.931 --> 12:51.689
to translate it back into, like,
our bachata salsa language.

12:51.793 --> 12:53.379
Today, absolutely not.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.793
<i>There was nothing
the same as what we do.</i>

13:01.413 --> 13:03.517
- Oh, it's over here. Over here.
- Yeah, I think it's right here.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.000
<i>What's this?</i>

13:05.103 --> 13:06.448
"Ka."

13:06.551 --> 13:07.896
-"Kh."
-"Kh."

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Okay, hi.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.034
- Derek.
- Hi. Claire.

13:11.137 --> 13:14.689
<i>Zaa, siin, shiin, saad.</i>

13:15.965 --> 13:18.758
<i>- Ha. Waaw.</i>
- <i>Ha. Waaw.</i>

13:18.862 --> 13:20.241
<i>- Yaa.</i>
- <i>Yaa.</i>

13:20.344 --> 13:21.482
- Again.
- Okay.

13:21.586 --> 13:23.310
-"Ha."
- This. "Kh."

13:23.413 --> 13:24.448
"Kh."

13:24.551 --> 13:26.068
- <i>Saad. Saad.</i>
- Bravo.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.758
- Through the lips.
- <i>Saad.</i>

13:27.862 --> 13:28.931
- Yeah. <i>Saad.
- Saad.</i>

13:29.034 --> 13:30.137
- It's like learning Korean.
- Yeah.

13:30.241 --> 13:31.862
- Well, this is like Hebrew.
- Yeah.

13:31.965 --> 13:34.034
<i>We were both
raised in Jewish families.</i>

13:34.137 --> 13:38.068
I grew up learning
Hebrew for my bat mitzvah,

13:38.172 --> 13:40.206
and the letters
and the sounds are very similar.

13:40.310 --> 13:42.137
I also know the Hebrew alphabet.

13:42.241 --> 13:43.896
We got to do it slow
when we do it.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.034
Yeah, we're gonna do it slow.

13:45.137 --> 13:46.517
This is a throaty one.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.000
- Okay. "K-Kh."
- Good.

13:49.103 --> 13:52.068
And this is <i>haa.</i>
And this is h...

13:52.172 --> 13:54.172
<i>- Ha. Ha.</i>
- Yeah. Okay.
- Very good, correct.

13:54.275 --> 13:55.448
Ra.

13:55.551 --> 13:56.655
- No. <i>
- Raa.</i>

13:56.758 --> 13:58.724
- Ra. Ra. <i>
- Raa.
- Raa.</i>

13:58.827 --> 14:00.310
<i>- Raa.</i>
- There's an "R" sound, Marcus.

14:00.413 --> 14:02.000
- R-R-Ra. <i>
- Raa.</i>

14:02.103 --> 14:03.241
<i>- Kha.</i>
-"Raaf."

14:03.344 --> 14:04.689
<i>There were some letters</i>

14:04.793 --> 14:07.310
<i>that were difficult
for me to pronounce.</i>

14:07.413 --> 14:08.724
We have to hurry up
and get through this,

14:08.827 --> 14:10.724
<i>so we can stay in first.</i>

14:16.517 --> 14:18.379
- Hey, so check it out.
Check it out. Check it out.
- Raa.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.034
Do you want
to remember the first half,

14:20.137 --> 14:21.689
and I'll remember
the second half?

14:21.793 --> 14:23.793
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Okay? Okay.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.482
I reread the instructions
and it just said that...

14:26.586 --> 14:28.068
...it says, as a team,

14:28.172 --> 14:30.000
we have to go through
the entire alphabet.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.965
<i>- So I'm like,
"Let's just divide it up 14-14."
- Let's divide it up.</i>

14:33.068 --> 14:34.965
<i>And I don't have to worry about</i>

14:35.068 --> 14:37.310
saying this letter that
I can't say the correct way.

14:37.413 --> 14:39.793
<i>- Raa. Raa.</i>
- Ra. Ra.

14:39.896 --> 14:42.068
<i>- Raa, raa, raa.</i>
- I'm trying.

14:43.379 --> 14:45.000
<i>If Michael can say it,</i>

14:45.103 --> 14:48.000
I think we can kind of expedite
getting through this challenge.

14:48.103 --> 14:51.344
<i>- Kha. Kha.</i>
-"Raaf. Raaf."

14:52.517 --> 14:54.206
- That looks like a Roman...
- That looks
like a Roman theater.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.758
That looks like something.
Let's check over there.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.448
<i>Whoa.</i>

14:57.551 --> 14:58.965
I don't think this is it.

14:59.068 --> 15:00.448
That looks
like a Roman theater, guys.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.310
<i>We're putting
a lot of pressure on ourselves</i>

15:02.413 --> 15:03.620
<i>to get that first place.</i>

15:03.724 --> 15:05.724
There's no entrance there.

15:05.827 --> 15:07.827
This looks
like a Pit Stop, guys.

15:07.931 --> 15:09.724
<i>When we thought
that was the Pit Stop,</i>

15:09.827 --> 15:11.586
<i>- we thought we were last.</i>
- Oh, no.

15:11.689 --> 15:13.413
- Oh, my God.
- Baby, you got to run.
You got to run with me.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.586
Classic <i>Amazing Race</i> mistake.

15:15.689 --> 15:18.551
Run a direction without
knowing where you're going.

15:18.655 --> 15:19.827
Yeah.

15:19.931 --> 15:21.344
Hashemite Plaza.

15:21.448 --> 15:22.620
That way.

15:26.275 --> 15:27.448
All right, babe, it's here.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.758
Let's get this dance going.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.310
- Available dance instructor.
- Okay.

15:30.413 --> 15:32.310
- We choose you.
- Welcome.

15:32.413 --> 15:34.620
- Yes. Welcome.
- Let's watch the dance
you're gonna learn.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.655
Five and six and seven, eight.

15:36.758 --> 15:38.000
So you'll be
in front of each other.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.379
- Okay.
- All right.

15:39.482 --> 15:41.000
I'm gonna ask you
to go slower sometimes, okay?

15:41.103 --> 15:42.551
- That's fine. That's fine.
- Thank you.

15:42.655 --> 15:44.000
<i>It may not look like
I'm having fun,</i>

15:44.103 --> 15:45.551
<i>but I'd rather do this
than the alphabet.</i>

15:48.103 --> 15:49.448
<i>Can we try it? You good?</i>

15:49.551 --> 15:51.034
- Let's-let's try. Let's try.
- All right.

15:52.413 --> 15:54.137
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

15:54.241 --> 15:56.137
- He's gonna start.
- Okay.

15:56.241 --> 15:59.310
<i>Alif. Baa. Taa. Thaa.</i>

15:59.413 --> 16:03.034
<i>Jiim. Haa. Kha.</i>

16:03.137 --> 16:06.034
<i>Daal. Thaal. Raa.</i>

16:06.137 --> 16:07.137
<i>Zaa.</i>

16:08.517 --> 16:11.965
<i>Siin. Shiin. Saad.</i>

16:12.068 --> 16:13.827
<i>Daad.</i>

16:13.931 --> 16:15.586
<i>Taa.</i>

16:15.689 --> 16:17.206
<i>Thaa.</i>

16:17.310 --> 16:19.724
<i>Ayn. Ghayn.</i>

16:19.827 --> 16:21.931
<i>Faa.</i>

16:22.034 --> 16:24.689
-"Lam"?
- No. That was...

16:24.793 --> 16:26.551
Okay, try again.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.275
- Ra. <i>
- Raa.</i>

16:28.379 --> 16:30.517
- Ra.
- <i>Raa.</i>

16:30.620 --> 16:32.448
I-I can't curl my Rs,
so this is tough.

16:32.551 --> 16:33.689
Ra.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.068
-"En. En."
- <i>Ayn. Ayn.</i>

16:36.172 --> 16:37.931
-"En. Eh."
-"Eh."

16:38.034 --> 16:40.413
<i>Ayn. Ayn. Ayn.</i>

16:40.517 --> 16:43.482
All right, we got this.
We can do this.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.517
- Hello.
- Are you ready?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.448
- Can we go slow?
- Yeah, slow.

16:47.551 --> 16:48.724
Okay.

16:48.827 --> 16:51.034
<i>Alif. Baa.</i>

16:51.137 --> 16:53.172
<i>Taa. Thaa.</i>

16:53.275 --> 16:55.551
<i>Jiim. Haa.</i>

16:55.655 --> 16:57.068
<i>Kha.</i>

16:57.172 --> 16:58.793
<i>Daal.</i>

16:58.896 --> 17:00.724
-"Leem."
- No.

17:00.827 --> 17:02.931
- No. Not good.
- No? [chuckles]: Okay.

17:03.034 --> 17:04.689
I took Spanish
for three years in high school.

17:04.793 --> 17:06.344
I could never roll my Rs.

17:06.448 --> 17:08.724
I mean, I think that's, like,
a genetic disability. Um...

17:08.827 --> 17:10.000
We'll see how this goes.

17:10.103 --> 17:11.620
Back again.

17:13.034 --> 17:14.827
We know the order.
Just pronouncing...

17:14.931 --> 17:18.379
<i>Alif. Baa. Taa.</i>

17:18.482 --> 17:20.827
<i>Thaa. Jiim.</i>

17:20.931 --> 17:21.965
"Ha."

17:23.068 --> 17:25.931
- No.
- Ah. This is the <i>haa?</i>

17:26.034 --> 17:30.034
- This is <i>thaa</i> and <i>thaal.
- Thaa. Thaal.</i>

17:30.137 --> 17:33.379
<i>- Thaa. Thaal.
- Thaa. Thaal.</i>

17:33.482 --> 17:36.206
- Ha. Ha. <i>
- Haa. Haa.</i>

17:36.310 --> 17:37.482
- Ha. <i>
- Haa.</i>

17:37.586 --> 17:39.172
- Gh...
- Gh...

17:39.275 --> 17:41.655
<i>- Ghayn.
- Ghayn. Ghayn.
- Ghayn.</i>

17:41.758 --> 17:43.275
<i>Ghayn.</i>

17:44.310 --> 17:45.827
<i>- Roman theater?
- This has to be it.</i>

17:45.931 --> 17:47.448
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Yes!

17:47.551 --> 17:48.862
Hi.

17:48.965 --> 17:50.137
- You come with us?
- Yes.

17:50.241 --> 17:51.241
- Yes. Good.
- Let's go.

17:51.344 --> 17:53.551
I don't think
I did that right.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.103
<i>We got to the dance challenge
in such a good place.</i>

17:56.206 --> 17:58.241
We thought that
we could get it over with

17:58.344 --> 18:00.586
by the time other people
are showing up or-or even

18:00.689 --> 18:02.482
<i>get finished with it
while they're still practicing.</i>

18:02.586 --> 18:04.275
<i>It just so happens that
the three teams that showed up</i>

18:04.379 --> 18:06.517
<i>were
professional dance teams.</i>

18:06.620 --> 18:08.655
I-I lost it. I lost it.

18:08.758 --> 18:11.931
I've never danced with a sword
before. Let's do this.

18:12.034 --> 18:14.310
One, two, three, four.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.344
We look so... good, girl.

18:16.448 --> 18:17.620
Here, we... in place.

18:17.724 --> 18:20.965
One and hit. One and three step.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.620
Oh, wait, I cross this way.

18:22.724 --> 18:24.241
Like, I need
specific things, right?

18:24.344 --> 18:25.758
- So, let's...
- I'm trying
to get it, too.

18:25.862 --> 18:28.827
- Once I get it, I can tell you.
- I got you. I got you.

18:31.827 --> 18:35.206
<i></i> Daal. Thaal. Raa.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.482

19:00.586 --> 19:03.551

- Great.

19:03.655 --> 19:04.689
- Yes!
- Yeah!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.758
- Sir. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

19:11.034 --> 19:12.551
Drink some water.

19:12.655 --> 19:14.379
- Did the boys get it?
- Yeah, they got it.

19:14.482 --> 19:15.793
Oh, man.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.448
- Roadblock. Here it is.
-"Roadblock." This is...

19:17.551 --> 19:18.689
- I think it's you, man.
- All right.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.206
"Who's Feeling Broken Carted?"

19:20.310 --> 19:22.206
It doesn't
matter what you call it--

19:22.310 --> 19:25.103
a pushcart, a handcart,
a dolly, a rickshaw--

19:25.206 --> 19:27.551
if you need
to move something from A to B,

19:27.655 --> 19:29.275
then you
need a device like this.

19:31.034 --> 19:33.931
Here in Jordan,
they call this <i>earaba.</i>

19:34.034 --> 19:36.689
<i>In this Roadblock,
teams need to put one together</i>

19:36.793 --> 19:38.827
<i>and roll it to the Pit Stop.</i>

19:38.931 --> 19:41.482
- I guess I'll do.
- Mike is doing it.

19:41.586 --> 19:44.379
- All right, baby,
let's do it. We got it.
- Let's do it, baby. We got this.

19:44.482 --> 19:47.137
<i>This is the first time I've done
any kind of dance like this.</i>

19:47.241 --> 19:49.413
There's so much heart, so much
passion going inside this dance,

19:49.517 --> 19:51.310
and I'm just grateful
to be a part of it.

19:54.241 --> 19:55.413
I lost it.

19:55.517 --> 19:57.517
- And one and...
- Ah. I go there first.

19:57.620 --> 19:58.793
You got it.
Let's start again.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.448
So it's a swoop and grab?

20:00.551 --> 20:01.793
- Yes.
- Okay.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.379
- Babe, you look hot.
- Thank you, babe.

20:03.482 --> 20:04.965
- No, really, hot.
- Oh.

20:05.068 --> 20:06.448
I'm just kidding.
No, you look hot.

20:06.551 --> 20:08.586
I think the moment that
Luis finishes learning it,

20:08.689 --> 20:09.827
we're gonna do it right away.

20:09.931 --> 20:11.758
We're not even
gonna think about it.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.655
Sorry.

20:13.758 --> 20:15.758
- Let'’s do it.
One and done, baby.
- We're ready.

20:15.862 --> 20:18.931
One and done, baby.
We're ready to dance with you.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.896
We got it.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.103
I don't think so. Not yet.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.206
<i>You're not really
giving it the fluidity.</i>

20:40.310 --> 20:41.482
<i>Okay.</i>

20:41.586 --> 20:43.551
And you need
a lot more eye contact.

20:43.655 --> 20:45.137
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:45.241 --> 20:47.620
We got to go put on the costume,
'cause we're gonna try out soon.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.586
- I need help coming back,
after that spin.
- You do. You do.

20:50.689 --> 20:52.413
The dancers learned it
a little bit quicker,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.241
but that's okay,
because Luis isn'’t a dancer.

20:54.344 --> 20:56.724
So I trust him,
and I'm proud of him.

20:56.827 --> 20:58.068
He's learning it really quick.

20:58.172 --> 20:59.724
My hope is to get it
on the first try, man.

21:02.896 --> 21:04.517
Ah, I messed up there.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.413
It's okay.

21:06.517 --> 21:08.862
Uh, it's okay, guys.
I'm-a get it. I'm-a get it...

21:08.965 --> 21:10.965
I'm-a get it.

21:11.068 --> 21:12.517
I didn't even know
when to start.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.689
It was my fault, actually.
I had no idea when to start.

21:14.793 --> 21:16.931
And all of a sudden,
we were done.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.482
I just got
to learn when to start.

21:18.586 --> 21:20.103
- All right, we're ready to go.
- Keep your smile, babe.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.551
Let's go.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.000
I feel great. I feel
like we're gonna nail this.

21:24.103 --> 21:25.758
We're gonna have big smiles.
We're gonna have a great time.

21:25.862 --> 21:26.827
I'm-a flirt with my wife.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.034
I mean, any opportunity you have

21:28.137 --> 21:29.344
to flirt with your wife.
Come on.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.931
Oh, my God. That's enough.

21:46.551 --> 21:48.206
Uh, I messed up.

21:50.758 --> 21:52.310
I messed up. I'm sorry, babe.

21:52.413 --> 21:54.000
It's all good. We both did.

21:55.413 --> 21:56.724
<i>So we're looking for the park.</i>

21:56.827 --> 21:58.586
- On Al...
- On Hashemi Street.

21:58.689 --> 22:00.655
<i>That is, uh,
where the Roadblock is.</i>

22:01.689 --> 22:03.379
It says a park.
We're going to a park.

22:03.482 --> 22:04.689
Yeah.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.517
What, you think
that's the park right there?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.586
- Uh...
- I don't see
anything over there.

22:11.689 --> 22:12.724
Yeah.

22:18.517 --> 22:21.206
We're gonna find it.
You're gonna knock it out quick.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.448
- We're gonna
get to the Pit Stop.
- Yeah.

22:25.137 --> 22:29.689
<i>Faa. Qaaf. Kaaf. Laam.</i>

22:29.793 --> 22:32.206
<i>Miim. Nuun.</i>

22:32.310 --> 22:33.448
<i>Ha.</i>

22:33.551 --> 22:34.758
<i>Waaw.</i>

22:34.862 --> 22:36.000
<i>- Yaa.</i>
- Wonderful.

22:36.103 --> 22:38.448
- Oh, Thank you.
- Yay!

22:38.551 --> 22:39.965
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.068
So, twins and army brothers
went through that

22:42.172 --> 22:43.344
really quick, actually.

22:43.448 --> 22:45.758
So we're the only ones
here right now.

22:45.862 --> 22:48.655
I'm gonna to let you do it, just
'cause if we're running carts,

22:48.758 --> 22:51.586
I'm not gonna be able
to run carts right now.

22:55.517 --> 22:56.620
<i>- Raa.</i>
- Ra.

22:56.724 --> 22:57.862
R-Ra.

22:57.965 --> 22:59.655
I cannot roll my Rs.

22:59.758 --> 23:02.103
I've tried it every single year
on my birthday.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.931
Growing up, I was like,
"Today, this is the year

23:04.034 --> 23:05.862
- I'm gonna roll my Rs."
Literally.
- What?

23:05.965 --> 23:08.172
<i>And of course, what do
I have to do today? Roll an R.</i>

23:08.275 --> 23:09.965
- Yeah.
- And this is gonna
be my downfall.

23:23.172 --> 23:26.241
<i>Jiim. Haa. Kha.</i>

23:26.344 --> 23:30.448
<i>Daal. Thaal. R-Ra.</i>

23:33.862 --> 23:35.206
This guy was,
he was pretty hard about it.

23:35.310 --> 23:37.482
He was like,
"I want a perfectly rolled R."

23:37.586 --> 23:38.655
Ra.

23:38.758 --> 23:40.103
It's, like,
deep in your throat.

23:40.206 --> 23:41.758
It's not...

23:41.862 --> 23:43.931
Like, your deep tongue muscle.

23:44.034 --> 23:45.655
Thank God for Claire.
She actually taught me

23:45.758 --> 23:46.965
a technique
that worked pretty well.

23:47.068 --> 23:48.827
How do you gargle water?

23:49.793 --> 23:51.448
- I'll show you.
- Please.

23:52.827 --> 23:53.965
- Okay. Just do that same thing.
- Mm?

23:54.068 --> 23:55.896
Okay.

24:20.482 --> 24:22.448
Well done.

24:22.551 --> 24:24.103
- Yes.
- There you go.

24:24.206 --> 24:26.137
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

24:26.241 --> 24:28.620
- Thank you!
- Thank you, everyone! Thank you!

24:28.724 --> 24:30.034
"Feeling Broken Carted?"

24:30.137 --> 24:31.482
You got it, babe.

24:46.689 --> 24:48.689
Yes!

24:48.793 --> 24:50.620
So what do you think?

24:50.724 --> 24:52.689
- I think we got it.
I think we got it.
- I think that you got it, too.

24:52.793 --> 24:53.931
Yes!

24:54.034 --> 24:55.586
- Yes! Thank you, guys!
- Oh, my God.

24:55.689 --> 24:58.172
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

24:58.275 --> 24:59.517
I'm doing Broken Carted.

25:00.551 --> 25:02.827
We still got all-all the other
teams on the other side.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.275
You want to ask
this gentleman right here?

25:06.379 --> 25:08.413
- There's a guy here.
He will know.
- Okay. Okay.

25:08.517 --> 25:09.448
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.034
Al-Hashemi Park?

25:11.137 --> 25:13.965
Excuse me.
Is this Al-Hashemi Street?

25:16.586 --> 25:17.793
- It is this street.
- Yes.

25:17.896 --> 25:20.000
<i>we're looking for the park.</i>

25:20.103 --> 25:21.310
This way or that way?

25:21.413 --> 25:23.172
- That way? <i>Shukran.</i>
- That way.

25:23.275 --> 25:24.517
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.000
Thank you.

25:26.103 --> 25:27.310
- Jog a little? Or are you good?
- Yeah, we can jog.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.620
Just got to get there.

25:29.724 --> 25:31.103
Damn it. So we passed it?

25:31.206 --> 25:32.689
Let's just get there.
Let's get there.

25:32.793 --> 25:34.586
<i>We apparently passed the park
we're supposed to go to.</i>

25:34.689 --> 25:36.413
<i>Was it that one
that I pointed at?</i>

25:36.517 --> 25:38.068
<i>Probably.</i>

25:40.344 --> 25:41.482
It should be here, no?

25:41.586 --> 25:43.206
Look, there's carts there.

25:43.310 --> 25:47.034
"Choose a workstation
with tools and materials."

25:47.137 --> 25:49.689
All right, I'm gonna pick
the one closest to the sample.

25:49.793 --> 25:50.793
Oof.

25:50.896 --> 25:53.034
This is not a Lego set.

25:53.137 --> 25:54.275
You got this, babe.

25:54.379 --> 25:55.862
Who is that, Luis and Michelle?

25:55.965 --> 25:58.275
- Yeah.
- Damn, we blew our lead.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.551
- Hey. How are you?
- How's it going?

26:01.655 --> 26:03.965
So, what I do
is just put this...

26:04.068 --> 26:06.724
entire section together,
similar to that.

26:06.827 --> 26:09.000
I have no idea where
to start with this.

26:09.103 --> 26:11.206
<i>I was hoping it was
gonna be like IKEA furniture.</i>

26:11.310 --> 26:12.793
Nice little directions
with little pictures.

26:12.896 --> 26:15.517
<i>No, it's like, "Here's a cart.
Here's some wood."</i>

26:15.620 --> 26:17.793
<i>Here's some nails.
Here's a hammer. Go."</i>

26:17.896 --> 26:19.482
And I'm just like, "Oh, snap."

26:19.586 --> 26:20.689
This is not gonna be that easy.

26:20.793 --> 26:22.172
This is definitely not IKEA.

26:23.551 --> 26:24.827
Is this the park?

26:24.931 --> 26:26.827
- Oh...
- It's right here.

26:26.931 --> 26:28.448
- Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding me?

26:28.551 --> 26:30.379
All right, Molly, you got this.

26:30.482 --> 26:32.620
All right,
so we got Molly and Emily,

26:32.724 --> 26:34.827
and we
got Luis and Michelle here.

26:34.931 --> 26:37.379
I can probably do this.

26:38.379 --> 26:41.793
Maybe not as well as she could,
but I'll get it done.

26:41.896 --> 26:44.241
It doesn't look that hard,
I guess,

26:44.344 --> 26:47.413
but I guess we'll find out.

26:47.517 --> 26:49.379
I hope Emily's not doing this.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.827
- She's not.
- Oh, thank God.

26:51.931 --> 26:53.172
<i>After seeing you in Ducati,</i>

26:53.275 --> 26:55.241
<i>it's pretty intimidating, honestly.</i>

26:55.344 --> 26:56.655
I'm just gonna save things

26:56.758 --> 26:58.103
<i>for you to build,
whenever you visit.</i>

26:58.206 --> 27:00.137
- I'd love that. Please.
- We can do it together.

27:00.241 --> 27:01.448
Emily will look at it
and it will just,

27:01.551 --> 27:02.551
like, float into place.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.758
- Baby, focus!
- Sorry.

27:05.793 --> 27:08.586
<i>Daal. Thaal. Raa.</i>

27:08.689 --> 27:10.931
Derek finally
learned how to roll his Rs.

27:11.034 --> 27:12.344
<i>Raa.</i>

27:12.448 --> 27:14.172
That sounds good!

27:14.275 --> 27:16.068
- Sorta.
-"R-Rooma."

27:16.172 --> 27:17.482
Okay. Let's not get cocky.

27:17.586 --> 27:19.827
<i>Waaw. Yaa.</i>

27:19.931 --> 27:20.827
Great.

27:22.448 --> 27:24.758
<i>Raa!</i>

27:24.862 --> 27:26.241
All day, baby.

27:26.344 --> 27:27.448
- I'm feeling Broken Carted.
- Claire's feeling broken.

27:27.551 --> 27:28.896
Claire's feeling broken.

27:37.862 --> 27:39.724
Less bounce.

27:39.827 --> 27:40.965
- Less bounce.
- Less bounce.

27:42.517 --> 27:44.275
<i>Oh, it's here, Claire.</i>

27:44.379 --> 27:45.482
Go, go. Run, run, run.

27:45.586 --> 27:47.137
Derek and Claire,
they just showed up.

27:47.241 --> 27:49.241
I mean, it just looks like
a bunch of sticks right now.

27:58.482 --> 27:59.586
Broke one piece.

27:59.689 --> 28:01.103
You got Claire building again?

28:01.206 --> 28:02.758
<i>It's a redemption season.</i>

28:02.862 --> 28:04.724
I would just like to do
a little bit better

28:04.827 --> 28:06.310
than I did last time.

28:06.413 --> 28:08.931
Uh, I think this
is gonna be the one.

28:09.034 --> 28:12.068
- We're not out of it,
babe. We're still in it.
- We're not. We're not out of it.

28:12.172 --> 28:14.172
- Come on.
- Just don't want to be last,
but, hey.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.517
- We're still in it, babe.
- Okay.

28:32.862 --> 28:34.172
Yes!

28:34.275 --> 28:36.586
- Yes!
- Yeah!

28:36.689 --> 28:38.206
- Maybe?
- Maybe?

28:38.310 --> 28:40.379
Maybe?

28:40.482 --> 28:42.827
Yes!

28:42.931 --> 28:44.551
- Yes!
- Thank you.

28:44.655 --> 28:45.724
"Roadblock."

28:45.827 --> 28:48.551
Quinton's gonna
do the Roadblock.

28:48.655 --> 28:50.620
This is already done.

28:50.724 --> 28:52.793
So I'm just trying
to make sure it matches.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.517
<i>I thought it was an</i>

28:54.620 --> 28:57.517
-"attention to detail"-oriented <i>
- They're just</i>

28:57.620 --> 28:59.137
<i>- Roadblock.
- slapping the wood together.</i>

28:59.241 --> 29:00.517
<i>Instead of just
slapping it together.</i>

29:00.620 --> 29:02.275
<i>So I would go back
and look at the example,</i>

29:02.379 --> 29:05.413
<i>look at how many nails were on
each side of each plank of wood.</i>

29:05.517 --> 29:07.034
So that just takes time.

29:07.137 --> 29:08.827
Hey, looking good, Michael.
Looking good.

29:09.862 --> 29:11.862
Right now, I'm not trying
to make it perfect.

29:11.965 --> 29:15.206
Trying the best that I can,
and then go from there.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.655
Aubrey and David got...

29:16.758 --> 29:18.206
left before us, and Aubrey
and David aren't here.

29:18.310 --> 29:19.724
I think they're lost.

29:19.827 --> 29:23.206
There's a park
on Al-Hashemi Street.

29:24.344 --> 29:25.793
- Come here.
- Yeah.

29:25.896 --> 29:27.482
Okay, make a left.

29:27.586 --> 29:29.172
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

29:29.275 --> 29:30.482
Babe, this is all you now.

29:30.586 --> 29:31.862
- Go slow.
- I know. I'm focused.

29:36.482 --> 29:37.965
That's fine.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.482
<i>It definitely
was harder than it looked.</i>

29:41.310 --> 29:43.655
<i>We kind of were back
and forth, hitting and missing.</i>

29:43.758 --> 29:46.620
<i>It's hot.
You got this costume on.</i>

29:46.724 --> 29:48.068
Still bouncing.

29:48.172 --> 29:49.586
Don't jump.

29:49.689 --> 29:51.551
Don't jump at all.

29:53.379 --> 29:55.034
That's all right.

29:55.137 --> 29:57.344
I turned the wrong way.
I didn't turn one time.

29:57.448 --> 29:59.172
- You missed one step.
- Missed a step. I know.

29:59.275 --> 30:02.172
<i>You know, it's a very
nice dance, and it flows.</i>

30:02.275 --> 30:03.758
You know, I looked
like I was doing the robot

30:03.862 --> 30:05.448
in a, in a turban,
and, you know.

30:05.551 --> 30:06.896
Oh.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.275
We missed a beat.
Let's do it again.

30:08.379 --> 30:10.137
- Let's do it again.
- Ugh, so frustrating.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.620
So frustrating.

30:11.724 --> 30:13.137
We don't have a lot of time.
We're the last ones here.

30:13.241 --> 30:14.931
Babe, let's just relax
and get it right, okay?

30:21.620 --> 30:23.103
You got it, David.

30:23.206 --> 30:25.724
Uh, progress is going all right.
I'm just trying to make sure

30:25.827 --> 30:28.344
everything matches
up with the other side.

30:28.448 --> 30:29.862
I'm glad I got here first,

30:29.965 --> 30:31.862
'cause I got the one
closest to the sample.

30:31.965 --> 30:34.137
So that's gonna be
a huge advantage.

30:34.241 --> 30:35.965
I'm pretty decent
at building things.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.275
- Come on, David.
- I think I can do it.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.758
I have no experience
building anything.

30:40.862 --> 30:42.000
I build software.

30:42.103 --> 30:43.448
You built a Ducati, Claire.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.137
Yeah.

30:45.241 --> 30:46.896
We all know
how building the Ducati went.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I'm a helicopter mechanic,
so I...

30:51.034 --> 30:52.827
...I work with my hands a lot.

30:52.931 --> 30:55.310
Oh, I should have
started with the sides.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.034
Oh, that was stupid.

30:57.137 --> 30:59.448
- Come on, Mattie.
- Let's go.

31:00.931 --> 31:02.310
Oh, yeah, that feels good.

31:02.413 --> 31:03.896
Time to start
hacking and smacking.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.448
<i>We had to build a pushcart.
They had</i>

31:06.551 --> 31:08.482
one side where the wall
was built, one was not.

31:08.586 --> 31:11.172
<i>And you had to look at the model
and figure it out. And</i>

31:11.275 --> 31:12.448
- it can't be as bad as Ducati.
- Yeah.

31:12.551 --> 31:13.655
Let's go.

31:13.758 --> 31:15.137
Is there an order?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.517
<i>As of right now, everyone's here</i>

31:16.620 --> 31:18.241
except the newlyweds.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.068
<i>Glenda and Lumumba
are still not here.</i>

31:32.379 --> 31:35.310
I think we might just have...

31:35.413 --> 31:36.310
a clue.

31:39.655 --> 31:42.103
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

31:42.206 --> 31:43.689
Okay!

31:46.241 --> 31:48.103
"Who's Feeling Broken Carted?"

31:49.103 --> 31:50.482
I am.

31:50.586 --> 31:52.758
You're nailing it, Moll.

31:52.862 --> 31:54.275
I'm trying not to hit my finger.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.586
Abby and Will,
I'm thinking about you guys.

31:57.586 --> 31:58.793
Bam.

32:01.034 --> 32:03.310
What is going on
with these nails?

32:03.413 --> 32:04.482
Good job, honey.

32:04.586 --> 32:06.482
I'm, uh, trying to do my best

32:06.586 --> 32:09.724
to watch and learn
from the reference this time.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.310
Is this as fun as the Ducati?

32:11.413 --> 32:13.103
This is a little bit
more fun than the Ducati.

32:13.206 --> 32:14.793
Ah, this looks beautiful.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.068
This.

32:16.172 --> 32:18.689
Ah, that's how you use pliers.

32:18.793 --> 32:20.034
I think.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.482
Oh, hey!

32:25.413 --> 32:26.827
- Love you, babe. You got it.
- Oh, my God.
Love you, too, babe.

32:26.931 --> 32:29.034
Newlyweds just got here.

32:29.137 --> 32:31.965
Happy for them.
Doesn't change my game.

32:32.068 --> 32:33.586
All teams appear to be here now.

32:33.689 --> 32:36.137
We're all working on this
at the same time.

32:36.241 --> 32:38.379
Trying to come out on the top,
you know?

32:38.482 --> 32:41.275
I don't make stuff at home.
My husband does this.

32:41.379 --> 32:44.413
So I'm definitely completely
out of my element right now.

32:44.517 --> 32:47.862
So far, so good.
Both sides looks the same.

32:47.965 --> 32:49.965
Good job, David.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.000
Let's go, babe.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.689
Yes.

32:53.793 --> 32:57.068
So, now I'm working on...
I think it's called the axle.

32:58.103 --> 33:00.655
I don't even know what
I'm doing, honestly.

33:00.758 --> 33:02.482
But it looks
like I know what I'm doing.

33:02.586 --> 33:04.862
- Babe,
what do you need from me?
- Just encouragement.

33:04.965 --> 33:06.000
Just encouragement?

33:06.103 --> 33:07.413
All right. You got it, babe.

33:07.517 --> 33:09.034
I'm just gonna nail this.

33:09.137 --> 33:10.551
I'm gonna ask for a check,
and that's it.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.241
Really close.

33:12.344 --> 33:13.517
All right, Michael.
Let's get it done, man.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.344
- Let's get it done.
- This is so much better.

33:15.448 --> 33:16.931
This is what I always
should have been doing.

33:17.034 --> 33:18.551
Rookie mistake.

33:18.655 --> 33:20.310
Leverage, people.

33:20.413 --> 33:21.931
You need to have
leverage when you're hammering.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.965
You got this, Claire.
Slow and steady.

33:24.068 --> 33:25.758
Let's get something
that's sturdy out of here.

33:25.862 --> 33:28.689
Doesn't have
to look pretty to be sturdy.

33:30.551 --> 33:31.689
Can I get a check?

33:31.793 --> 33:33.689
Good job, baby.

33:33.793 --> 33:35.551
Mwah. Oh.

33:35.655 --> 33:37.206
It's not just
about getting this clue.

33:37.310 --> 33:40.172
It has to be sturdy enough
to carry everything to Phil.

33:43.344 --> 33:45.965
He's been killing it today.
I'm so proud of him.

33:47.172 --> 33:48.344
Yes.

33:48.448 --> 33:49.931
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

33:50.034 --> 33:51.689
- Thank you. You got everything?
- Mwah.

33:51.793 --> 33:52.896
- Put this away.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.103
Good for them.
I wish that was me.

33:55.206 --> 33:56.482
Okay.

33:56.586 --> 33:58.000
-"Route Info."
- Oh, my God.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.551
Here we go.
"Race to Roman Nymphaeum."

34:02.620 --> 34:04.689
This is just one of the reasons

34:04.793 --> 34:08.137
why Jordan is on
so many people's bucket list.

34:08.241 --> 34:10.482
This ancient land is scattered

34:10.586 --> 34:14.068
with incredible ruins like this.

34:15.482 --> 34:19.931
Teams will end their Jordanian
journey at Amman's Nymphaeum.

34:20.034 --> 34:22.310
The last team
to check in here...

34:23.344 --> 34:25.310
...will be
the last team to depart

34:25.413 --> 34:27.275
on the next leg of the race.

34:27.379 --> 34:28.793
"Take proper care of your cart

34:28.896 --> 34:30.655
and use it to bring your items
to Phil on the mat."

34:30.758 --> 34:33.241
Luis and Michelle
just finished the Roadblock.

34:33.344 --> 34:35.896
If Michael can finish this
thing in the next five minutes,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.896
I'll carry that myself,
and we'll run 'em down.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.586
Good job, baby. Let's go.

34:39.689 --> 34:41.827
We got one team out already,
so that puts up the pressure.

34:41.931 --> 34:43.206
Said "sturdy,"

34:43.310 --> 34:45.724
so I'm putting four in there
instead of two.

34:45.827 --> 34:47.793
- Baby, help me with the cart.
- Huh?

34:47.896 --> 34:49.517
A wheel fell off.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.068
Yeah, that was
actually my wheel.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.310
Babe, we got to carry it.

34:52.413 --> 34:54.034
- Okay
- Let's just carry.

34:54.137 --> 34:56.172
I guess we're gonna
walk it to the Pit Stop.

34:57.275 --> 34:58.724
- This came off.
- Oh, no!

34:58.827 --> 35:01.000
- The cart came-came apart.
- Do you have the tools?

35:01.103 --> 35:02.034
Yeah, the tools are here.

35:02.137 --> 35:03.517
Yikes.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.931
<i>- Oh, I feel bad for 'em.
- That's insane.</i>

35:05.034 --> 35:06.724
Are we all gonna be doing this?

35:06.827 --> 35:08.724
- We got to redo it.
- Let's... Yeah, let's redo it.

35:08.827 --> 35:10.275
<i>Cart's coming apart,</i>

35:10.379 --> 35:12.862
and we're supposed
to take it to Phil together.

35:12.965 --> 35:14.758
So we have to stop
and build it again.

35:21.068 --> 35:22.827
All right.
We're gonna do this again.

35:22.931 --> 35:24.000
Check.

35:24.103 --> 35:25.655
Ah, David, did that quick.

35:27.172 --> 35:28.068
Another person's
getting a check.

35:28.172 --> 35:29.862
- Yeah!
- Yes.

35:29.965 --> 35:32.137
It's David. David was
the first one to finish.

35:32.241 --> 35:33.758
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

35:33.862 --> 35:35.482
- They're moving. They're moving.
- They're moving? It's okay.

35:35.586 --> 35:37.172
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

35:37.275 --> 35:39.172
- Try and add a few more.
- Yeah.

35:39.275 --> 35:40.275
David, go!

35:43.206 --> 35:44.655
Yeah, it looks
like theirs fell apart.

35:45.689 --> 35:46.862
Slowly. Good, good, good.

35:46.965 --> 35:49.206
English? English?

35:49.310 --> 35:50.655
Watch your step.
Pick it up slowly.

35:50.758 --> 35:51.965
Very slowly.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.620
Do you know where this is?

35:53.724 --> 35:55.241
Roman Nymphaeum.

35:56.310 --> 35:58.724
Can you look, can you
look it up on your phone?

35:58.827 --> 36:00.241
Thank you.

36:00.344 --> 36:02.275
We know exactly
where the Pit Stop is.

36:02.379 --> 36:04.275
We passed it
on the way to the Roman Temple.

36:04.379 --> 36:05.620
We got this, baby.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.137
Oh!

36:08.241 --> 36:10.034
- Come on, babe, come on.
- Sorry. Sorry.

36:10.137 --> 36:11.310
- Raise it, raise it.
- Go.

36:11.413 --> 36:14.034
Extra slow here. Extra slow.

36:14.137 --> 36:15.862
- I don't want this
falling apart again.
- Okay.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.655
- Go, go, go.
- Watch this corner.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.655
This way, David.

36:22.241 --> 36:23.551
Oh, yes!

36:23.655 --> 36:25.413
There you go. Let's go.
Let's go.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.827
Yes!

36:26.931 --> 36:28.172
They're very happy.

36:28.275 --> 36:30.172
Welcome to Amman, Jordan.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.724
Thank you so much.

36:31.827 --> 36:34.172
I told you you had to give
it all for this leg of the race.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.896
You did that, and you have
been rewarded with first leg.

36:40.137 --> 36:41.586
Back-to-back wins.

36:41.689 --> 36:43.241
- Back-to-back, baby.
Back-to-back.
- Back-to-back...

36:43.344 --> 36:45.413
- There's more good news.
- Yes.

36:45.517 --> 36:47.103
As the winners
of this leg of the race,

36:47.206 --> 36:50.310
- you have won
Expedia reward points...
- Yeah.

36:50.413 --> 36:53.172
good for
a five-night trip for two

36:53.275 --> 36:54.965
to Barcelona.

36:55.068 --> 36:57.793
Oh, Barcelona!

36:57.896 --> 37:01.724
<i>Expedia experts are gonna
design a unique local experience</i>

37:01.827 --> 37:05.413
<i>that includes a Montserrat

37:05.517 --> 37:09.000

37:13.275 --> 37:15.896
The other good news is that
you will be in the first group

37:16.000 --> 37:17.793
leaving on
the next leg of the race.

37:17.896 --> 37:19.724
<i>Getting one first place</i>

37:19.827 --> 37:21.172
could have some luck involved.

37:21.275 --> 37:22.379
We might be lucky.

37:22.482 --> 37:24.241
Getting
back-to-back first places.

37:24.344 --> 37:26.206
<i>Uh-uh.
That's not all luck, baby.</i>

37:26.310 --> 37:28.241
<i>That's some skill. I feel
like we're the team to beat.</i>

37:30.275 --> 37:32.448
This is why
being a dancer is great.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.137
Hate building things.

37:34.241 --> 37:36.413
Look at her. Grease on her face.
She doesn't even need...

37:36.517 --> 37:38.172
No one else
has grease on their face.

37:38.275 --> 37:39.586
Check.

37:39.689 --> 37:41.034
Check!

37:41.137 --> 37:43.965
I think I initially
took too much time on the...

37:44.068 --> 37:45.310
on the wheel.

37:45.413 --> 37:47.482
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah!

37:47.586 --> 37:49.068
- Come on, now.
- Let's go, girl.

37:49.172 --> 37:50.896
Looks like another team
is also about to head on out.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.034
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

37:53.137 --> 37:54.068
- Okay.
- Good job.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.517
Oh, my gosh, Claire, good job!

37:55.620 --> 37:57.206
<i>Man, how are,
like, other people</i>

37:57.310 --> 37:59.793
getting here after us
and then leaving before us?

37:59.896 --> 38:01.379
<i>I was getting frustrated.</i>

38:01.482 --> 38:03.551
<i>Maybe it was
too much attention to detail.</i>

38:03.655 --> 38:04.931
- I'm sorry, Marcus.
- It's all good.

38:05.034 --> 38:06.931
<i>Just pick it up. I'll drag it.</i>

38:07.034 --> 38:08.551
Keep it up,
keep it up, keep it up.

38:08.655 --> 38:10.620
Beep, beep.

38:10.724 --> 38:12.793
- Sorry, Derek. Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:12.896 --> 38:14.551
Fast, fast.

38:14.655 --> 38:16.206
- Is that... Do we
have to go up the street?
- Hurry.

38:16.310 --> 38:18.551
- Excuse me.
- Watch out.

38:18.655 --> 38:21.068
Watch it. Slow.
Slow, slow, slow.

38:22.103 --> 38:24.172
<i>You're almost there, baby.
Come on, come on.</i>

38:24.275 --> 38:25.379
Oh, my goodness.

38:26.379 --> 38:28.172
- Yeah.
- Phil,
every time we see you,

38:28.275 --> 38:30.103
you have this unpleasant look
on your face, because...

38:30.206 --> 38:32.172
I have an unpleasant look?

38:32.275 --> 38:34.344
Because we know that
we're probably

38:34.448 --> 38:35.931
the last or second to last.

38:36.034 --> 38:38.620
And today we got here, and
you have a smile on your face.

38:38.724 --> 38:39.965
Your cart is in pieces,

38:40.068 --> 38:42.551
but you have
arrived here intact.

38:42.655 --> 38:43.724
And I'm pleased to tell you

38:43.827 --> 38:45.689
you're the second team
to arrive.

38:45.793 --> 38:47.344
Yeah!

38:48.344 --> 38:50.689
Man, we're still there.
We still got a couple teams.

38:50.793 --> 38:51.689
They're still working.

38:51.793 --> 38:54.793
Last piece, I think. Check.

38:54.896 --> 38:58.862
These aren't fitting properly,
so I'm trying to adjust.

38:58.965 --> 39:01.068
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.310
Thank you.

39:02.413 --> 39:03.551
Check.

39:03.655 --> 39:05.931
You're doing a great job.
Keep it up, babe.

39:06.034 --> 39:08.655
Thank you.
All right, let's do it.

39:10.137 --> 39:11.482
I see Quinton and Mattie.

39:11.586 --> 39:13.931
<i>- You see them?
- Go!</i>

39:15.379 --> 39:17.827
Oh, my God. It is hot here.

39:17.931 --> 39:19.275
Yeah, I keep hitting my calf.

39:19.379 --> 39:20.724
Yeah, I know.

39:20.827 --> 39:23.034
Yes, dude, we're so close.

39:23.137 --> 39:25.586
You got it, Derek.
Work smarter, not harder.

39:25.689 --> 39:27.000
Okay, just carry it
to the next...

39:27.103 --> 39:28.241
Over there. Right over there.

39:28.344 --> 39:29.758
Right or straight?

39:30.724 --> 39:31.758
I don't know.

39:32.758 --> 39:34.689
You got this. You got it.

39:34.793 --> 39:37.034
There you go.

39:38.034 --> 39:40.000
- Congratulations. <i>
- Okay,</i>

39:40.103 --> 39:41.758
I'm gonna roll it
the rest of the way.

39:41.862 --> 39:43.517
Oh, and another team.
Look at that.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.827
You guys are racing
really tight together.

39:46.827 --> 39:47.793
Thank-thank you.

39:47.896 --> 39:49.000
Quinton and Mattie, I'm pleased

39:49.103 --> 39:50.413
to tell you that
you're team number three.

39:50.517 --> 39:52.482
You can probably
count up the carts.

39:52.586 --> 39:53.965
Derek and Claire,
that means that

39:54.068 --> 39:55.758
you are team number four.

39:55.862 --> 39:57.068
Very good news.

39:57.172 --> 39:58.379
You will be leaving
in the second group.

39:58.482 --> 40:01.241
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

40:01.344 --> 40:04.068
Honestly, I do feel like
I let my husband down today.

40:04.172 --> 40:06.931
- No, baby, baby, we're good.
We are good.
- I wanted to win. I'm sorry.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.310
You're okay, babe.

40:09.413 --> 40:11.586
Take a break. Come here.
Come here.

40:12.551 --> 40:13.793
Glenda.

40:13.896 --> 40:16.793
Listen, listen.
Drink some water, okay?

40:16.896 --> 40:19.275
Don't be discouraged.
You're doing great.

40:19.379 --> 40:21.206
- I'm completely
confident in you.
- Okay.

40:21.310 --> 40:23.793
And I need you to not think
that this is a failure

40:23.896 --> 40:25.931
because you're struggling at it.

40:26.034 --> 40:27.103
All right?

40:27.206 --> 40:29.482
All right,
so relax a little bit,

40:29.586 --> 40:31.310
don't be frustrated,
and then just keep going.

40:31.413 --> 40:32.482
- Okay.
- Keep it going.

40:32.586 --> 40:34.068
Good job, baby.

40:37.206 --> 40:39.172
Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

40:39.275 --> 40:41.103
There you go. Bring it in.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.586
Michael and Marcus
arrived in at fifth place.

40:43.689 --> 40:46.344
Emily and Molly, that would
make you team number six.

40:46.448 --> 40:48.344
- All right.
- On the next leg of the race,

40:48.448 --> 40:50.275
you will be leaving
in the third group together.

40:50.379 --> 40:51.344
- Yes.
- You're not last.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.137
But you're in that group.

40:53.241 --> 40:55.724
Both teams standing in front
of me here have a chance

40:55.827 --> 40:57.068
of winning this Amazing Race,

40:57.172 --> 40:59.586
$1 million
is waiting for one team.

40:59.689 --> 41:02.068
- Yep.
- And there's no reason

41:02.172 --> 41:05.137
why it can't be one of you.
No reason at all.

41:05.241 --> 41:07.000
Yes.

41:07.103 --> 41:09.310
Yay!

41:13.862 --> 41:15.344
Yay.

41:15.448 --> 41:17.000
Okay. Great job.

41:17.103 --> 41:19.034
Well, it's been a while, guys,

41:19.137 --> 41:20.655
- um, but you made it here.
- A while.

41:20.758 --> 41:23.172
- We made it.
- But you have arrived last.

41:24.206 --> 41:26.413
And that's gonna make it
tough for you in the next leg.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.689
I did tell you that you
would be leaving 45 minutes

41:29.793 --> 41:31.758
- Mm-hmm.
- after the first teams
leave on the next leg.

41:31.862 --> 41:33.827
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

41:33.931 --> 41:35.137
Glenda, I see
tears in your eyes.

41:35.241 --> 41:37.586
Are you just overwhelmed?

41:37.689 --> 41:39.827
I'm happy I got that cart done.

41:39.931 --> 41:43.137
I do feel like...
I let my husband down today.

41:43.241 --> 41:45.482
- Oh, no.
- Even though I know
that he doesn't feel that way.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.137
That's just how I feel.

41:47.241 --> 41:49.482
Yeah. You did it, babe.
She made me proud, Phil.

41:49.586 --> 41:51.517
Every moment that I look at her

41:51.620 --> 41:53.862
doing something new,
something different, you know,

41:53.965 --> 41:56.034
I just-I just get strength,
and I'm excited for our future.

41:56.137 --> 41:57.413
You should be excited.

41:57.517 --> 41:59.000
Here's the thing about <i>
The Amazing Race.</i>

41:59.103 --> 42:01.068
Even if you arrive last
on one leg,

42:01.172 --> 42:03.689
that doesn't mean you
can't arrive first on the next,

42:03.793 --> 42:06.275
and it doesn't mean that you
can't go on to win this race.

42:06.379 --> 42:08.448
<i>I don't expect
to go home the next leg.</i>

42:08.551 --> 42:11.241
Even though we're starting 45
minutes behind the first team,

42:11.344 --> 42:12.551
<i>we're still here.</i>
