01:09.403 --> 01:11.503
I can't breathe.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.475
I can't breathe.

02:48.569 --> 02:53.472
<i>¶ We're the members</i>

<i>See Officer Nooney for exact time.</i>

05:14.581 --> 05:17.949
Hell of a life collecting drunks
all morning.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.919
All right, have a seat. Have a seat.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.365
Roll call.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.000
- Lyles.
- Here.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.735
Bloomguard.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.837
Greetings and hallucinations,
Sergeant Yanov.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.774
10-D-31.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.009
- Goodman.
- Here.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.577
- Wolensky.
- Here.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.113
10-D-32. Van Moot.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.815
Here.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.882
Sartino.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.084
Here.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.518
10-D-22.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.455
- Whalen.
- Yo.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.090
- Slate.
- Present.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.591
10-D-1.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.759
- Brown.
- Yes, sir.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.860
- Kingsley.
- Here.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.994
10-D-13.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.963
- Motts.
- Here.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.031
Tanaguchi.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.104
Tanaguchi? You here?

06:12.106 --> 06:15.140
He went to a Bela Lugosi
film festival last night, sarge.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.409
He won't answer to his name anymore.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.479
I suppose you'd call that
a spooked gook, huh?

06:24.418 --> 06:26.985
Count Dracula.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.889
Well, don't be afraid.
Come right through the door.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.726
10-D-74.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.828
- Rules.
- Yeah.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.963
Proust.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.766
Proust.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.673
Proust?

06:48.675 --> 06:51.910
Oh, everything's code-4 here, sir.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.148
10-D-85.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.084
- Sergeant Green.
- Here.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.420
10-L-30. Sergeant Knight.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.521
Here.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.756
10-L-20.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.827
Uh, I've been ordered to tell you
that the captain is uptight

07:08.829 --> 07:11.196
about the wino with the pocket
full of dog crap

07:11.198 --> 07:13.732
they found sleeping
in the lieutenant's car last night.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.037
They suspect one of you guys
put him there.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.682
Ah, Jesus Christ! Why me? Why me
all the time, huh?

07:30.684 --> 07:32.784
Well, whoever it was,
you'd better knock it off, okay?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.589
Who's working the desk tonight?
Anybody know?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.591
Oh, uh, Hadley.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.626
Yeah, well, I wish they'd put
one of the Hadleys on day watch

07:41.628 --> 07:43.862
so this lineup wouldn't get screwed up.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.465
Is it Policeman Hadley
or Policewoman Hadley?

07:46.467 --> 07:47.532
No Balls.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.838
Huh?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.073
We call them Balls Hadley
and No Balls Hadley.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.109
It's No Balls Hadley.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.613
Oh, yeah.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.751
Hardass!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.259
You finished reading
the crimes, Yanov?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.227
Yes, lieutenant.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.867
All right, I got a few things to say.

08:21.869 --> 08:25.003
You can all quit griping about how
long you have to wait in night court.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.905
I've talked it over with the captain

08:26.907 --> 08:28.773
and he's talked it over
with the commander,

08:28.775 --> 08:30.742
and he talked it over
with the deputy chief.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.177
And he talked it over with dear Abbey

08:32.179 --> 08:33.678
who's really running
this fuckin' department.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.300
For your information, Whalen,

08:38.301 --> 08:40.018
the captain happens to be
right behind you men.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.052
Yes, sir, I know that, sir.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.556
I felt him there many times.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.295
I think the captain was
pretty good to you, Whalen,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.731
considering your last fitness report.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.533
Thirty pounds overweight.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.800
Couldn't get your hands
down to your knees.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.702
You got tits like a woman.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.171
Five days suspension was very lenient.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.875
I know that, lieutenant.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.744
I also know shit rolls downhill.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.585
But why are we always
living in a valley?

09:13.587 --> 09:16.588
You're coming up for your pension
pretty soon, aren't you, Whalen?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.023
Seven, eight months, is it?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.090
Six.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.962
Let me make you a promise, Whalen.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.064
Even if you don't screw up,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.066
even if you play it straight,

09:28.936 --> 09:31.636
you can count on me.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.072
I'll help you fuck it up
so you never get your pension.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.351
Okay, I'm having a choir practice

09:46.353 --> 09:48.887
at my apartment tonight after work
and you're all invited.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.123
Let's go get 'em.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.068
How'd you like to use that
on some scrote tonight, partner?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.270
On what?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.306
Some scrote. Scrote. Scrotum.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.175
Oh.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.778
Scrote. I decided it's a
better word than "asshole."

10:13.780 --> 10:16.348
That's what they are out there,
ain't it, Dean?

10:16.350 --> 10:20.285
Ignorant, filthy, shit-filled scrotes.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.887
There you are, a man's philosophy
expressed in a word.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.956
Hear, hear, Roscoe.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.125
What an insufferable creep.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.995
Ah, come on, let's go.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.239
Lieutenant "Hardass" Grimsley.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.645
You know, if you pulled
a condom over his ears

10:46.647 --> 10:48.213
you'd know exactly what he is.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.317
Come on, you got six months to go
till your pension.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.852
Don't let him steal it from you.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.855
How far do you let 'em push, damn it?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.189
Where's the limit?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.437
Hey, Roscoe.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.873
You know, the only thing
I like about you?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.076
You just don't hate brothers,
you hate everybody, man.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.944
You got it, Uncle Remus.

11:19.946 --> 11:23.448
Don't you boys get into any trouble now.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.317
You be careful of the dark streets
tonight, Turkey.

11:29.823 --> 11:34.125
<i>Remember, you guys, one car moves,</i>
<i>all the cars move.</i>

11:41.201 --> 11:42.434
All right, all right, all right.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.169
You stay right there.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.270
Hold it, I said.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.472
Move back.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.375
Well, he's behind me. I can't help it.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.843
It's not my fault, it's his.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.112
Move forward!

11:54.114 --> 11:55.213
We got to get to west.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.715
Come on!

11:56.717 --> 11:58.383
Assholes, back off!

11:58.385 --> 12:00.118
Watch your language.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.822
Will you shut up! Just pull the car
forward, you dummy!

12:03.824 --> 12:06.191
Hey, creep. You...

12:10.464 --> 12:11.863
Cut it out!

12:11.865 --> 12:14.466
Pull this car forward. Pull the car...

12:14.468 --> 12:17.435
Will you pull the car forward, Rules?

12:17.437 --> 12:20.038
You guys are all gonna get suspended!

12:31.752 --> 12:32.517
Yeah.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.987
Hey, sarge. Sarge.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.422
Sarge, it's for you.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.764
Hey, Lyles! Hey, hey!

12:45.766 --> 12:47.999
Okay, Dean, it's up to you.

12:48.001 --> 12:52.003
What do you mean, sarge?
What do you mean?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.872
I said it's up to you.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.806
Who?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.510
Sarge, it's your landlady.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.545
Yeah, well, ask her what she wants.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.082
What do you mean,
"Dean's done it again?"

13:04.084 --> 13:06.785
What's it all about, Baxter?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.419
What's it all about?

13:08.421 --> 13:10.121
That's what we're all
trying to figure out, Dean.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.956
Come on, let's go beddy-bye.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.025
I don't wanna go beddy-bye.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.360
Nighty-night.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.304
She said if you don't make those people
put on their bathing suits,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.306
she's going to call the cops!

13:28.308 --> 13:31.276
Oh, yeah? Well, you tell her there's
no cops left to call.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.343
There's no cops left.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.012
There's no cops left.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.147
I want to go back to the front room.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.605
Ah, come on back, No Balls.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.907
Hey, you and me might
be partners sometime.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.576
I hear you're a real cop.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.611
A regular Dickless Tracy.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.980
Kiss my ass!

14:08.982 --> 14:10.582
Oh, I'd love to.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.022
Come on.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.227
Oh!

14:27.367 --> 14:30.435
Whoo!

14:30.437 --> 14:34.105
Hey, Cheech, you still got the
hots for No Balls?

14:34.107 --> 14:35.273
Oh.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.176
I love her, Spencer.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.411
I really love her.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.215
I am not going to stay in that pool

14:44.217 --> 14:47.285
while those pea-brained chest-beaters
are fooling around.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.221
You know that Spermwhale tried to
pull my drawers down.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.891
Sperm was drunk.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.126
So he grabbed your ass. Big deal.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.996
We're all police officers.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.065
Spermwhale's just...

15:01.067 --> 15:04.335
Look, I drove you here,
I'll drive you home.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.305
Just let me go to the can
and tell Nick Yanov that we're leaving

15:07.307 --> 15:09.908
and I'll get your clothes.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.676
- Well, hurry up, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.222
...says you talk to your wife while
you're having sex.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.556
Is it only by telephone?

15:25.558 --> 15:27.492
I think it's the funniest
thing I've ever heard.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.088
Spencer, what did you do
with Father Cheech?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.402
<i>¶ Don't say a word</i>

16:11.404 --> 16:14.038
<i>¶ don't say anything</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:17.342
<i>¶ let's pick it up</i>
<i>and make it, make it</i>

16:17.344 --> 16:19.310
<i>¶ I love it, baby</i>

16:19.312 --> 16:22.347

16:22.349 --> 16:23.982

<i>¶ make it, make it, make it ¶</i>

17:10.497 --> 17:11.763
God love ya!

17:15.602 --> 17:18.069
Oh! You disgust...

17:18.071 --> 17:21.039
You crazy! I'm gonna kill you, you...

17:21.041 --> 17:23.574
Oh! Crazy deviate.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.409
Leave me alone!

17:42.062 --> 17:44.429
You don't know what he did to me!
I wanna kill him!

17:44.431 --> 17:47.098
Let me at him! I'm gonna kill him!

17:47.100 --> 17:49.233
I'm gonna kill him!

17:55.275 --> 17:57.708
Deanie. Come on, Deanie.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.812
Hey, Dean. Dean, we got
a birthday present for you.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.246
Go at it, boy.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.148
Hey, No Balls!

18:04.150 --> 18:05.316
No, don't! Come on, please!

18:06.586 --> 18:09.120
Get out of here, you animal!

18:10.790 --> 18:15.159
So this guy decides he ain't gonna sign
his traffic ticket.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.395
And he starts telling me
he ain't going to the slam.

18:17.397 --> 18:21.365
So in about two seconds he's wearing
my sap in his hair.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.734
And I knee-dropped him. And if
you do it just right, you know,

18:23.736 --> 18:27.305
you can just punch right through
the scrote's vital organs.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.340
Just puncture his kidneys
and rupture his spleen.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.109
Just bam, like that, you know?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.443
<i> Delta 18...</i>

18:32.445 --> 18:33.778
Then I made him do the chicken.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.315
You what?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.151
It's a choke hold. You know?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.787
When you choke 'em out and they
pass out and convulsions,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.857
flop around on the ground
making funny noises.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.896
It was funny as hell to see.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.764
He went...

18:56.903 --> 18:59.670
<i>10-delta-85,</i>
<i>10-delta-85.</i>

18:59.672 --> 19:02.807
<i>Possible jumper, Wilshire and Brewer.</i>
<i>Handle code 3.</i>

19:02.809 --> 19:05.743
Uh, 10-delta-85. Roger.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.412
Come on, Dean. That's no way to Roger
a call like that

19:08.414 --> 19:09.914
when an operator's got a voice
like that, man.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.150
She sounded like a fox.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.352
I'll show you how to do this.

19:14.354 --> 19:18.756
10-delta, D for dynamite, 85.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.593
That's a Roger on the call, baby.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.932
That'll make her wet up
her little black pants, won't it?

19:27.934 --> 19:31.802
That guy on 10-D-85, he sounds like
an insufferable prick.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.362
It was all my fault.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.531
I should never have let miss Monroe
in the office,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.700
but she said she had to come back
to get some things.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.702
Yeah, yeah. We're going to go up there
and try to talk her down.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.470
So you tell the sergeant that
when he gets here. You got it?

20:06.472 --> 20:08.673
- I got it.
- Come on, Dean, Jesus.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.721
Take your hat off.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.922
They think you look better
with your hat off.

20:24.924 --> 20:25.990
It's in the manual.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.293
Oh, hi, baby.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.764
Hey, you're kinda foxy lookin',
ain't ya?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.335
Say, why don't you come on inside...

20:37.337 --> 20:39.637
Hey, wait a minute, Miss. Hold it.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.272
Hey, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.741
Now wait. Wait a minute.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.345
Roscoe, let's back off and wait for
the sergeant, okay?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.814
We're not going to back off nothin'.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.617
She's a ding-a-ling. And I know how to
handle ding-a-lings.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.719
Now come on, baby.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.420
I mean, nothing's that bad, is it?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.325
Why don't you just come on
back inside here

21:01.327 --> 21:02.693
and we can jaw about it a little bit.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.962
- Oh!
- Missy!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.364
Now don't go any closer.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.466
She's really going to do it.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.335
Now stay. Now stay. Okay?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.971
Stay.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.675
Roscoe, let's go back inside and give
this lady a chance to think, okay?

21:17.677 --> 21:20.411
Listen, damn it! I'm going to
handle this my way.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.546
And I'm going to show you something.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.814
You want to see something?

21:28.988 --> 21:32.456
Well, you got your audience here,
haven't you?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.626
I guess that's what
you've come for, huh?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.395
I mean, if you don't give
a shit about your life,

21:37.397 --> 21:39.730
we don't either, you know.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.833
We got better things to do than stand around
up here and baby your ass all night.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.039
I mean, why don't you? If you want to,
just go ahead, bitch! Jump!

22:26.012 --> 22:28.546
Sorry, sarge.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.815
We didn't get a chance
to talk to her. She...

22:30.817 --> 22:33.017
She jumped before we got to the roof.

22:35.421 --> 22:38.656
I just wish we'd been there
a little sooner, that's all.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.515
Side of coleslaw.

23:04.517 --> 23:08.152
Two burgers, a tuna on wheat toast.
Up together.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.922
Hey, lady, I got 45 minutes for lunch,
not 45 years.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.162
Gee, I hope my suitcase
is safe over there.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.598
Huh?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.866
My suitcase.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.839
I just got in from Philly and I don't
know anybody in this town.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.042
I got a room at the motel but it won't
be available until 9:00.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.912
I hope my bags are safe over there
by the door.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.516
Oh, yeah, they'll be plenty safe.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.518
Sure.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.553
No one would dare steal anything with
a big policeman here.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.192
You know, it's very funny.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.694
I was in Philadelphia
when I was in the army.

23:50.696 --> 23:51.929
Really?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.632
Yeah. You want a piece of pie?

23:54.634 --> 23:55.633
Sure, why not?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.700
Uh, Miss?

23:58.638 --> 23:59.970
This is a dumb idea.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.210
Yeah, well, you don't have to be
in on it. This is personal.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.045
Uh-uh. I'm with you.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.782
All I know, it's either him or me.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.121
Hey! Hey!

24:19.592 --> 24:22.593
Oh, duck down, duck down.
Don't let him see you.

24:22.595 --> 24:25.129
Keep his attention buried
and don't look this way.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.238
He thinks he's in love. That dummy.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.809
All things come to he who waits.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.048
Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.584
We got plenty of time.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.726
Let's go.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.177
Oh, baby, you don't seem like a negro!

25:14.881 --> 25:17.882
You seem like a Samoan!

25:21.687 --> 25:23.621
I hope she gives the
signal nice and loud.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.758
Oh, honey.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.928
Oh, you got balls like an elephant

25:30.930 --> 25:32.596
and a wang like an ox!

25:33.833 --> 25:34.965
That's it.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.938
No, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't...

25:42.074 --> 25:43.307
What are you doing here?

25:45.745 --> 25:47.211
Lieutenant Grimsley!

25:49.181 --> 25:50.981
We had a call a woman was being
assaulted in here, sir.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.052
- We had no idea.
- Keep it quiet in there.

25:55.054 --> 25:55.953
How humiliating!

25:55.955 --> 25:58.188
Shh! Keep your voice down.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.865
Uh, sir, there's some dew on the lily.

26:07.867 --> 26:08.732
Maybe you should wash up.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.269
No.

26:15.741 --> 26:20.644
Look, fellas, why don't I meet you down
at Pepe's Diner, huh?

26:20.646 --> 26:22.813
I'd like to buy you
a couple of hamburgers

26:22.815 --> 26:24.014
and talk to you for a few minutes.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.585
Sure, sure, we'll meet you,

26:27.587 --> 26:29.620
but I was wondering, lieutenant,

26:29.622 --> 26:31.322
do we gotta keep calling you
"lieutenant?"

26:34.860 --> 26:36.627
What's in a name?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.629
That's what I always say,

26:41.200 --> 26:42.299
Hardass.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.309
Here's another one
to cheer up your evening.

27:25.311 --> 27:29.246
A gentleman kidnapped a woman
at gunpoint up on La Cienega.

27:29.248 --> 27:33.851
He stuck his automatic down his
waistband while he made her blow him.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.319
And right in the middle of the head job,

27:35.321 --> 27:36.987
she reaches up and pulls the trigger.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.056
Shot his balls off.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.427
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.781
What happened to you?

28:03.783 --> 28:04.948
I was attacked in the locker room.

28:06.886 --> 28:07.751
By who?

28:08.254 --> 28:09.353
A duck.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.829
All right. Listen up.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.367
The...

28:23.369 --> 28:27.171
The captain says that the night watch
hasn't been doing very well

28:27.173 --> 28:28.706
with the whistle selling campaign.

28:30.943 --> 28:34.878
Now, you men know that the whistle
selling campaign is very important and...

28:34.880 --> 28:37.915
Hey, uh, lieutenant, excuse me.

28:40.086 --> 28:43.020
Is it true the station buys those
whistles for seven cents?

28:43.022 --> 28:45.055
Uh, I'm not sure.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.725
And we sell them for 50 cents
to poor old ladies

28:47.727 --> 28:51.261
who think they can stop crime by
blowing whistles at bad guys

28:51.263 --> 28:53.197
until their faces look like rotten
strawberries.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.102
The profits go to the
youth services fund.

28:58.104 --> 29:01.905
That's a hell of a scam,
43 cents profit.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.140
Who was the eunuch
that thought that up?

29:05.511 --> 29:07.311
I was the eunuch
that thought that up.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.454
Well, that's a great idea. Uh, I gotta
hand it to you, sir.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.223
Let's hear it for the lieutenant.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.965
I was...

29:27.967 --> 29:31.335
I thought maybe the troops could get
cut in on some of the action.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.936
That's not possible, Whalen.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.973
Oh, now look, seriously, sir. I...

29:38.077 --> 29:42.346
I have an idea for selling whistles
to every broad in the city.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.518
All right! Knock this bullshit off!

29:49.121 --> 29:50.220
Dismissed.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.819
Oh, pardon me, I just came by

30:21.821 --> 30:24.454
to tell miss Farrell how much
I enjoyed her act.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.591
Her dancing.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.961
Her performance?

30:30.963 --> 30:31.428
Excuse me, officers.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.168
I sure have heard a lot about you.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.871
Hi. You must be Spermwhale.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.306
I'm Foxy.

30:42.308 --> 30:46.243
Yes, you are. You certainly are.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.011
Who was the guy?

30:48.013 --> 30:50.247
Oh, you supplement your
income with him, huh?

30:50.249 --> 30:53.050
Oh, Baxter, you're such a prude.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.586
He's such a prude.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.588
I keep telling him he's a prude.

30:57.590 --> 31:00.424
Yeah, that's why I love him.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.526
When did I ever charge you, Baxter?

31:06.198 --> 31:08.966
Spermwhale, will you do me a favor?

31:08.968 --> 31:11.535
I'll be right out.
Will you wait in the car?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.572
Well, only if I have to.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.407
Bye-bye, Spermwhale.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.443
Oh.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.080
Bye, Foxy.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.157
Baxter, come on, Baxter.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.592
Cut it out.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.029
Don't be so upset. That guy's just
a club customer.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.398
He comes backstage just to touch
the merchandise,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.367
to see if it's real.

31:43.369 --> 31:46.370
I wouldn't do anything
to him if he wanted to.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.674
I only fooled around
with him a little bit.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.609
I wouldn't be sweet to him like I...

31:52.611 --> 31:55.279
You are disgusting, do you know that?

31:55.281 --> 31:57.581
You have no honor and no dignity.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.150
I know that and you know that.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.452
I wouldn't go down on that old fat cat.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.289
Come on.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.592
Come on, Baxter.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.964
Come here.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.134
Come on, baby.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.504
Come here.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.042
Come on.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.045
Come on, baby, he doesn't have

32:28.046 --> 32:31.047
the equipment or the imagination,
not to turn me on.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.116
You do. You got it all.

32:34.219 --> 32:37.120
I turn you on, huh?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.990
Easy, baby, you're all wound up.

32:39.992 --> 32:42.592
Why don't you light a joint?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.161
I'm on duty with that guy,
for God's sake.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.263
He'd pick it up in five seconds.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.298
Okay, if you don't want to smoke grass,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.701
why don't you take a couple of downers.
Okay, baby?

32:50.703 --> 32:52.602
Relax, honey.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.171
Where are they?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.073
In the ice tray over there.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.415
Ah, it's going to be good tonight.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.285
I'm really in the mood.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.558
You liked it, Baxter.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.729
Don't you mark me up!

33:18.731 --> 33:20.597
Don't you ever mark me up!

33:24.570 --> 33:25.502
How long have you been seeing Foxy?

33:28.140 --> 33:29.473
Too long.

33:34.046 --> 33:38.515
None of my business, kid, but I'd
shine her on if I was you.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.585
She ain't exactly your type.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.354
What's my type?

33:48.193 --> 33:50.527
Booze and reds don't mix, son.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.698
Now I've seen you
take them both at once.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.669
That's not what scares me.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.772
What really scares me, Spermwhale,

34:01.774 --> 34:05.208
is that in those Jesuit boarding schools

34:05.210 --> 34:07.744
where good old mom
left me most of my life,

34:07.746 --> 34:12.682
I was taught that
there's an absolute good

34:12.684 --> 34:15.419
and an absolute evil and...

34:15.421 --> 34:18.355
You didn't hear a single damn thing
I said, did you?

34:22.127 --> 34:23.727
You can't wait to get out, can you?

34:26.432 --> 34:28.265
I got it all mapped out.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.536
Did I ever show you a picture?

34:32.538 --> 34:35.372
Knock it off about that boat,
for God's sake.

34:35.374 --> 34:39.176
Hey, it's not a boat,
it's a Monterey Trawler.

34:41.113 --> 34:42.379
Huh?

34:42.381 --> 34:43.613
Looks fine.

34:45.084 --> 34:49.152
Ah, she's got 20 years on her.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.788
The hull's sound and she's got
a brand new diesel.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.292
I'm buying in half.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.696
We go for salmon in summer.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.798
You ever fished for salmon?

35:02.134 --> 35:03.233
No.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.138
Damn beautiful.

35:08.140 --> 35:11.641
You know what, kid? I think we can all
use some choir practice.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.312
Roscoe passed out!

35:15.314 --> 35:19.316
This is the most fantastic thing
I have ever done.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.686
Look at this.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.622
Come here, look at this.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.197
I took some bread...

35:34.199 --> 35:35.298
He took some bread.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.633
...and I sprinkled it here.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.834
And he sprinkled it here.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.536
- From the water...
- From the water.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.871
...to Roscoe's crotch.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.405
To Roscoe's crotch.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.807
I unzipped his pants...

35:43.809 --> 35:45.475
You unzipped his pants.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.444
...and I stuffed some crumbs in there.

35:50.549 --> 35:55.685
Boy, that old duck's really
working out on old Roscoe.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.890
Roscoe was never one to duck a fuck,
but to fuck a duck?

36:02.761 --> 36:04.794
Hey, Roscoe, you eunuch.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.630
Wake up and look at your crotch.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.898
Hey, don't throw things.
You might hurt the duck.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.867
Yeah.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.835
Ain't that something? He can't get his
pecker out of Roscoe's shorts.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.570
They don't have peckers,
they have bills.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.305
Oh!

36:28.921 --> 36:31.721
Roscoe, quit picking on the duck.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.203
Goddamn! He's lost his pants.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.313
Don't you put them on me.

37:07.259 --> 37:10.760
Don't you put them on me.
By God, I'll kill you!

37:10.762 --> 37:13.597
Don't kill me, Roscoe. I'm your pal.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.013
Let's go back and leave him alone
for a while, all right?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.684
Damn you!

37:34.686 --> 37:37.254
Come on, will you? Let's go.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.888
Let me off of here.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.825
I'll kill every one of you.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.030
I'll cut your fat heart out,
I swear to God.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.932
Be right with you, Roscoe.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.704
I swear to God I'll kill ya.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.706
Now you let me loose, Whalen.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.875
Get back here!

38:01.346 --> 38:02.712
I'll kill ya!

38:02.714 --> 38:03.947
I'll kill every one of ya!

38:03.949 --> 38:06.750
You got a cute little butt, Roscoe.

38:06.752 --> 38:10.453
I want to see what do you mean Dean.
Alone.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.724
Why?

38:16.528 --> 38:19.462
Maybe after Dean,

38:21.533 --> 38:23.400
I might think about a little

38:25.504 --> 38:26.703
choo-choo.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.378
But first, I want Dean.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.517
Oh, shit!

38:47.759 --> 38:49.959
What do you mean?

38:49.961 --> 38:51.628
I'm talking that Ora Lee wants you to
go over there and stir a bunch, boy,

38:51.630 --> 38:53.363
that's what I'm talking about.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.864
All right, all right, come on,
get out of there.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.833
All right, all right, come on.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.369
Out of the way, out of the way. All right.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.705
Listen, Dean. Dean, Dean.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.572
All right, give me a beer.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.107
Hey, sausage face.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.545
Dean. Dean. Listen, Dean.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.015
Hey, listen, kid, huh?

39:13.485 --> 39:16.019
It's me. Dada.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.388
Dada!

39:20.359 --> 39:21.458
Dada!

39:23.762 --> 39:25.428
It's Spermwhale.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.898
You know me, don't you?

39:31.002 --> 39:33.436
Ah, it may wake him up.

39:33.438 --> 39:34.571
Now look.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.642
Beer, beer.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.644
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Beer, beer.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.681
- Beer, beer.
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.417
First you listen, then beer, beer.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.498
What the hell is that?

40:07.672 --> 40:08.938
My God.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.475
A naked person.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.814
What the hell is this?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.085
Are you real?

40:23.622 --> 40:24.921
Is it my imagination?

40:24.923 --> 40:27.424
Naked, in the dark, my God!

40:29.528 --> 40:33.630
In the dark, in the park.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.465
Who in the hell are you?

40:35.467 --> 40:36.866
Luther Quigley.

40:41.807 --> 40:45.175
But I'll be anyone you want me to be.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.844
Now listen, there's some drunks over
there by that water fountain.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.547
You go get one of them
right now, you hear?

40:50.549 --> 40:52.449
Oh, who needs anybody else.

40:53.885 --> 40:58.021
Don't you know that three's a crowd?

40:58.023 --> 41:00.056
I'm chained to this damn tree.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.558
You damn fool!

41:01.560 --> 41:03.693
I can't believe it.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.497
A naked man chained to a tree. It's...

41:07.499 --> 41:11.568
It's a crazy, mad, salacious fantasy!

41:11.570 --> 41:14.771
I'll kill you if you touch me,
you fag son of a bitch!

41:14.773 --> 41:15.839
My, my.

41:18.743 --> 41:19.609
Oh!

41:19.610 --> 41:20.476
You're not real anyway.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.213
I'm getting faint.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.816
I'll knee drop you.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.919
I'll rip your damn kidneys,
I'll puncture your spleen.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.155
You'd do that for me?

41:32.157 --> 41:34.591
Whalen! Whalen!

41:34.593 --> 41:36.793
What's all the racket?
What is he yelling about?

41:36.795 --> 41:39.863
We forgot Roscoe. Roscoe! We're coming!

41:39.865 --> 41:41.197
Whalen!

41:41.199 --> 41:43.166
Amelia, come. Come, Amelia.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.234
Whalen!

41:44.236 --> 41:45.835
Come, sweetheart. Come!

41:45.837 --> 41:48.638
He sounds dangerous. He's cracking up!

41:48.640 --> 41:50.707
Whalen! Whalen!

41:50.709 --> 41:53.743
Hey, what the hell's going on?

42:03.855 --> 42:06.689
Yeah, that damn Dean had us
preoccupied, Roscoe.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.626
Hey, how's your wrists?

42:09.628 --> 42:10.827
Oh, they're all right.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.028
Okay, boy?

42:21.907 --> 42:23.273
Roscoe, now let's talk.

42:23.275 --> 42:24.641
No, no.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.109
Let's talk a minute there, Roscoe.

42:26.111 --> 42:29.045
There was this little faggot

42:29.047 --> 42:30.813
who came along and made a fool
out of me.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.556
Roscoe. Come on, Roscoe.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.262
Get the gun! Get the gun!

43:01.613 --> 43:04.180
Hey, come on. Somebody is bound
to call the cops.

43:04.182 --> 43:05.982
Let's get out of here.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.751
Come on, let's go.

43:08.753 --> 43:09.619
Come on, come on!

43:27.706 --> 43:30.373
You don't look big enough to fight,
fuck, or run a footrace.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.649
You one of the new kids
on the block, huh?

43:39.651 --> 43:43.019
I'm one of the patrol officers
on loan to vice.

43:43.021 --> 43:45.221
Are you a policeman?

43:45.223 --> 43:47.991
I'm a sergeant. I run the night watch.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.395
The name's Dom Scuzzi.

43:52.397 --> 43:54.364
You Lyles,
Bloomguard or Slate?

43:54.366 --> 43:56.699
Harold Bloomguard,
sergeant.

43:56.701 --> 43:58.901
- I said call me Scuz.
- Ah.

43:58.903 --> 44:02.171
There's no formality in this squad.
Sit down, please.

44:06.011 --> 44:07.944
You know, I've seen you around,
Skus, but...

44:07.946 --> 44:10.647
Ah. Scuz as <i> scusa</i> me.

44:11.883 --> 44:14.417
Scuz.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.352
Uh, well, I've seen you around,
but I always thought that you were...

44:16.354 --> 44:19.222
A janitor? I don't mind. I don't mind.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.291
My pop was a janitor.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.727
Put nine kids through school
pushing a broom.

44:37.242 --> 44:38.775
These are clear glass.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.877
Sure.

44:40.879 --> 44:43.246
They make you look even less like a cop.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.416
If that's possible.

44:49.988 --> 44:52.722
Harold, you're gonna operate whores.

44:52.724 --> 44:55.458
Oh, I don't know much about whores,
Scuz.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.926
Nothing to worry about.

44:56.928 --> 44:59.262
All you gotta do is make them offer
sex for money.

44:59.264 --> 45:01.397
You got that? Sex for money.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.200
You in the service?

45:04.202 --> 45:05.902
- Marines.
- Good.

45:05.904 --> 45:07.136
The broads overseas got it made.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.338
Sucky fucky, five bucks.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.874
Our girls have a thing
called entrapment.

45:11.876 --> 45:15.278
They want to say sucky fucky
and have you say the price.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.147
Or they want to say the price
and have you say sucky fucky.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.482
You get that?

45:20.385 --> 45:22.118
I think so.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.120
It's just a word game.

45:24.122 --> 45:27.423
You got to figure a way to make them
say the whole thing.

45:27.425 --> 45:30.727
Those black-robed pussies in the
courtroom have agreed to that at least.

45:30.729 --> 45:32.995
So make it nice and legal.

45:32.997 --> 45:35.431
Uh, sucky fucky, five bucks.

45:35.433 --> 45:37.266
Yeah, that's it.

45:37.268 --> 45:39.235
I knew you were a smart kid.

45:43.274 --> 45:44.741
Thank you.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.510
Oh. Hiya.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.247
Oh, hi.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.482
These are the other two guys
from my section.

45:56.020 --> 45:59.756
Shit. You two look like young,
clean-cut, healthy cops.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.390
Why don't you look sick and puny
like this one?

46:03.261 --> 46:05.128
This is the sergeant.

46:10.869 --> 46:13.302
Excuse me. Sorry.

46:14.773 --> 46:16.205
Call me Scuz.

46:16.207 --> 46:17.406
Uh, this is Lyles and Slate, Scuz.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.541
Welcome.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.176
- Sam Lyles.
- How are you?

46:20.178 --> 46:22.311
- And I'm Slate.
- Oh.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.847
Glad to have you
for a couple of weeks.

46:24.849 --> 46:27.283
Here's your coffee, Scuz. Without cream.

46:29.287 --> 46:32.388
Fellas, when the regular
vice cops come in,

46:32.390 --> 46:34.891
pay attention to what they say.

46:34.893 --> 46:35.958
Another thing, remember,

46:35.960 --> 46:38.961
a vice pinch is a misdemeanor.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.496
I don't want to see you
getting yourselves hurt.

46:43.401 --> 46:46.335
I swear to God, you get yourselves
hurt, I bust you out.

46:50.842 --> 46:53.109
Another thing, if you go
sneakin' and peekin'

46:53.111 --> 46:55.111
and prowling around the alleys,

46:55.113 --> 46:58.848
pay particular attention to the <i>cacca.</i>

47:08.126 --> 47:09.458
You got that?

47:41.125 --> 47:42.525
Hey, Scuz.

47:43.127 --> 47:46.028
Scuz.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.531
Uh, what happens
if I get a parking ticket?

48:17.562 --> 48:19.662
We're set, Scuz.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.631
We got two complaints that some fruits
are hanging around

48:21.633 --> 48:24.166
hitting on guys when they come in.

48:24.168 --> 48:28.104
Now, you guys are charged with
protecting the public morals, right?

48:28.106 --> 48:29.505
Right, Scuz.

48:29.507 --> 48:32.375
Now I'm gonna leave you guys

48:32.377 --> 48:34.243
and you wait for a vice cop
named Pete Zoony

48:34.245 --> 48:36.312
to come and babysit you.

48:36.314 --> 48:39.382
Maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

48:39.384 --> 48:43.286
Meantime, I'll take Harold and see if
he can operate some whores for us.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.087
You guys get bored,

48:46.557 --> 48:48.190
try amusing yourself betting quarters

48:48.192 --> 48:50.626
whether the next guy in the John is
helmet or anteater.

48:52.430 --> 48:53.596
What does that mean?

48:53.598 --> 48:56.465
Circumcised or uncircumcised.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.301
May the force be with you.

49:01.406 --> 49:03.506
Well, they're probably
holding that shoplifter

49:03.508 --> 49:05.107
back here in the security office,

49:05.109 --> 49:06.309
so why don't you go and take the report?

49:06.311 --> 49:08.411
I'm gonna go take a leak, okay?

49:11.015 --> 49:12.548
Well, go on.

49:12.550 --> 49:13.516
Okay.

49:27.398 --> 49:28.664
It's Roscoe!

49:36.207 --> 49:37.673
What's he doing here?

49:48.086 --> 49:49.719
Oh, isn't he cute?

50:05.403 --> 50:07.570
I can't believe this shit.

50:25.256 --> 50:26.655
I'm Pete Zoony.

50:28.726 --> 50:31.093
Don't bother with the bets. I'm Jewish.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.478
<i>¶ I've got a crush on you</i>

50:50.381 --> 50:52.615
<i>¶ sweetie pie ¶</i>

51:05.063 --> 51:07.329
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

51:07.331 --> 51:09.198
Oh, I hope not.

51:12.737 --> 51:15.571
I suppose you think you've got a lot
of guts, don't ya?

51:17.108 --> 51:20.109
Why, whatever do you mean, officer?

51:20.845 --> 51:22.845
Oh!

51:22.847 --> 51:24.664
You come in here and talk to me

51:24.665 --> 51:26.482
like I'm some kind of damn civilian
or something.

51:26.484 --> 51:30.086
I don't care what you are.

51:30.088 --> 51:33.089
You're only so cute is what you
really are.

51:33.091 --> 51:36.325
Don't you talk to a police officer
like that.

51:36.327 --> 51:37.860
Well, you don't have to get angry

51:37.862 --> 51:41.363
just because someone
pays you a compliment.

51:41.365 --> 51:43.232
Why, you insolent faggot!

51:44.802 --> 51:47.303
You wouldn't poke fun at a cripple,
would you?

51:47.305 --> 51:49.705
- Mmm?
- You sissy bastard!

51:49.707 --> 51:52.641
Oh, you're so cute when you get mad.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.547
Oh. Oh, you blue meanie.

52:04.789 --> 52:06.255
Roscoe, don't!

52:11.262 --> 52:13.129
How do you like that?

52:15.533 --> 52:16.799
Bubble butt!

52:18.236 --> 52:20.769
Roscoe! No!

52:20.771 --> 52:23.806
Take it easy, Roscoe! Take it easy!

52:23.808 --> 52:25.508
- Let go of me!
- He's a vice cop.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.443
You cocksucker!

52:27.445 --> 52:29.879
Me a cocksucker? Me a cocksucker!

52:29.881 --> 52:31.580
You a cocksucker!

52:33.718 --> 52:35.351
Fucking asshole!

52:35.353 --> 52:36.685
What the hell are you guys doing here?

52:36.687 --> 52:38.420
We're staking the joint out!
He's a vice cop!

52:38.422 --> 52:41.323
I'll stick a nightstick up your ass,
you stupid fink!

52:41.325 --> 52:42.491
Get off of me!

52:42.493 --> 52:44.426
Goddamn, Roscoe, control yourself!

52:44.428 --> 52:45.694
Let go of me!

53:06.617 --> 53:07.683
Hey, hey, hey.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.919
- Hey, hey. Hi.
- Hey.

53:09.921 --> 53:11.353
Hey, now you stay right here.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.755
Right here?

53:12.757 --> 53:15.491
Yes, you stay right there.
Wait right there.

53:15.493 --> 53:17.927
Don't move. I'll be right back.
Don't move.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.296
Okay.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.231
I mean, how in the hell was I supposed
to know, anyway?

53:22.233 --> 53:25.968
If you ask me, a little joke like that
ain't too funny.

53:25.970 --> 53:27.169
I mean, I could have choked you out

53:27.170 --> 53:28.369
and made you do the chicken, anyway.

53:28.372 --> 53:30.573
I think you got off sort of easy.

53:33.211 --> 53:34.677
Anyway, there's no
hard feelings, huh?

53:42.653 --> 53:46.989
No, no, Rules, there's no hard feelings.

53:46.991 --> 53:48.557
Listen, Rules, I'd just like to think

53:48.559 --> 53:50.926
that I could play a little catch up.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.679
Hey, you waited, huh?

54:10.681 --> 54:13.015
Well, greetings and constipation,
ladies.

54:13.017 --> 54:14.750
Which one of us do you want?

54:16.821 --> 54:18.654
It's in venereal to me.

54:19.890 --> 54:21.257
How about both?

54:21.259 --> 54:24.026
Oh, my name's Sabrina.

54:24.028 --> 54:25.494
And I'm Tammy.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.663
Well, my name's Gustav Leekly.

54:27.665 --> 54:30.266
And I'm a certified public accountant.

54:30.268 --> 54:32.368
Nobody asked you what you did.

54:32.370 --> 54:33.602
Why'd you say that?

54:33.604 --> 54:35.537
Well, I...

54:35.539 --> 54:38.807
Listen, what am I going
to get from you girls?

54:38.809 --> 54:39.808
What are you going to get?

54:41.612 --> 54:42.778
Whoo-hoo!

54:42.780 --> 54:43.846
Oh!

54:48.452 --> 54:50.686
Come on, honey, let's get going.
We gotta get going.

54:50.688 --> 54:52.454
You follow us in your car.

54:52.456 --> 54:55.824
Okay. Just a minute. I just wanted to...

54:55.826 --> 54:59.528
Is this... well, you know, the cost?

54:59.530 --> 55:01.497
Oh, come on, honey.

55:01.499 --> 55:05.034
We're going to talk about the m-o-n-e-y
when we get there.

55:05.036 --> 55:07.336
Now you just follow us, huh?

55:07.338 --> 55:09.571
Look it, we don't have all this time

55:09.573 --> 55:11.907
to stand around here listening to you

55:11.909 --> 55:13.442
whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

55:13.444 --> 55:14.743
Hey!

55:14.745 --> 55:16.545
- Now you just follow us.
- Okay.

55:16.547 --> 55:17.880
- Come on.
- All right.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.624
Come on, babe, let's take him
to the same place.

55:29.860 --> 55:32.828
Well, here we go.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.830
Yeah. You gonna be all right?

55:40.971 --> 55:42.638
- Is he coming?
- Yeah, here he is.

55:42.640 --> 55:43.739
Oh, there he is.

55:43.741 --> 55:45.774
He's coming right along.

55:45.776 --> 55:46.742
Honey, this is a weirdie.
Isn't he weird?

55:46.744 --> 55:48.344
That man is strange.

55:48.346 --> 55:49.845
Come on. Come on.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.755
I'm telling you, he's gonna be
something, baby.

55:59.757 --> 56:02.091
Come on. Come on. Come on.

56:02.093 --> 56:03.425
- You know...
- Yes?

56:03.427 --> 56:05.661
This is an amazing coincidence,

56:05.663 --> 56:07.996
because your car is red
and mine is red.

56:10.634 --> 56:13.969
Yeah, I tell you. I wonder if we could
start talking about the finances.

56:13.971 --> 56:15.637
Oh, well, come on, come on. Get in.

56:15.639 --> 56:16.705
We will talk in a minute.

56:16.707 --> 56:18.407
Sit in the middle here.

56:18.409 --> 56:19.908
Oh, don't worry about the baby.

56:19.910 --> 56:22.111
It is fine. Just slide right over.

56:24.415 --> 56:26.048
- That's fine.
- Come on!

56:26.717 --> 56:28.417
Hey, whoa, whoa!

56:28.419 --> 56:29.685
- Okay.
- Here we go!

56:29.687 --> 56:31.153
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ow!

56:31.155 --> 56:32.955
- Sorry.
- You nearly broke my wrist.

56:32.957 --> 56:34.123
I'm not trying to do anything.

56:34.125 --> 56:36.492
Okay. Okay, honey, okay!

56:36.494 --> 56:38.627
Now, come on, let's get it on.

56:38.629 --> 56:39.762
Get it on!

56:41.098 --> 56:42.831
Get it on!

56:42.833 --> 56:44.533
I tell you.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.502
Okay, okay, tell me. Okay, tell me.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.669
What do you want? What do you want?

56:47.671 --> 56:50.172
- Well, I'll tell you what I want.
- Yeah?

56:50.174 --> 56:51.807
I wonder if it would be possible if we
could just sort of put the top up.

56:51.809 --> 56:53.776
You want to put the top up?

56:53.778 --> 56:55.043
Yeah, up.

56:55.045 --> 56:59.047
Okay. We will put
the top up for the man.

56:59.049 --> 57:01.617
Good. It's a fancy little bugger,
isn't it?

57:01.619 --> 57:02.684
Yeah. Top coming up?

57:02.686 --> 57:04.019
Yeah, it's getting up.

57:04.021 --> 57:06.855
Getting up? Oh, stop it! You stop it!

57:06.857 --> 57:08.991
Oh, the top is coming up.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.826
Getting up. Oh, you're a devil. Okay.

57:10.828 --> 57:11.827
Anything to please the man.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.162
Is this your car?

57:13.164 --> 57:16.965
Uh, baby, my daddy gave me this.

57:16.967 --> 57:18.167
Oh, your daddy. That's nice.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.568
What line of work is your father in?

57:20.838 --> 57:21.870
Oh, baby, stop!

57:23.674 --> 57:24.706
- You don't mean that?
- How long have you...

57:24.708 --> 57:26.542
Oh! The top is up!

57:26.544 --> 57:27.876
- Seven months.
- Seven months.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.445
The top is up.

57:29.447 --> 57:30.846
The top is up, baby.

57:30.848 --> 57:32.581
Just for you, baby.

57:32.583 --> 57:35.484
Okay, now, let's figure out...
What am I gonna get?

57:35.486 --> 57:37.019
Well...

57:37.021 --> 57:38.487
Sweetie, in this business
we have a requirement.

57:38.489 --> 57:40.088
The man has to say what he wants.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.690
Now this is a legal thing.

57:41.692 --> 57:43.826
Well, I'll tell you. I'm looking
for excitement.

57:43.828 --> 57:46.094
Excitement, baby? You got it!

57:46.096 --> 57:48.597
You want me to draw you a diaphragm?

57:48.599 --> 57:51.600
A diaphragm!

57:51.602 --> 57:54.570
Hey, baby, you don't have to draw me
a diaphragm.

57:54.572 --> 57:56.472
Hey, now let's take care of business
here.

57:56.474 --> 57:58.807
- Hey, now wait a minute.
- Come on now!

57:58.809 --> 58:01.043
Here, come on, baby.
Let's take care of business.

58:01.045 --> 58:03.145
Hey, wait, wait. No, no, no, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:03.147 --> 58:04.813
What do you think you're doin'?

58:04.815 --> 58:06.949
What the hell am I supposed to be doin'?

58:06.951 --> 58:09.818
Well, I just... we haven't discussed
business yet.

58:09.820 --> 58:10.686
Business?

58:12.089 --> 58:14.990
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Okay, okay, okay.

58:14.992 --> 58:17.059
Now, let me tell you
what we can do for you.

58:17.061 --> 58:19.061
Uh, we can French you.

58:19.063 --> 58:20.496
French?

58:20.498 --> 58:22.531
- We can ball you.
- French, oh, that's...

58:22.533 --> 58:25.901
We can do anything for you
you want us to do.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.002
As long as it's not weird.

58:28.539 --> 58:29.271
And for 50 bucks.

58:31.609 --> 58:33.642
Baby, that is cheap. That is cheap.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.277
Sucky fucky, five bucks. Thank you.

58:35.279 --> 58:36.612
Sucky fucky what?

58:36.614 --> 58:37.880
All right, here we go.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.815
Step outside please. Get outside.

58:39.817 --> 58:41.217
Just get outside the automobile.
Here we go.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.618
Come on, just get outside.
You wait in the car.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.052
Get out of the automobile. Come on.

58:44.054 --> 58:45.888
Stand over there. Okay.

58:45.890 --> 58:48.690
Now, I gotcha. I got your purses,
I got your keys,

58:48.692 --> 58:51.026
and you're not going anywhere
except with me.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.728
- What?
- All right? You are under arrest.

58:52.730 --> 58:54.530
What do you mean we're under arrest?

58:54.532 --> 58:56.598
What do you mean we're under arrest?

58:56.600 --> 58:58.800
I am a police officer.

58:58.802 --> 58:59.902
You're a what?

58:59.904 --> 59:01.637
I'll show you in a second.

59:01.639 --> 59:04.840
There it is. All right. There you go.

59:04.842 --> 59:05.941
Metropolitan Police Department.

59:05.943 --> 59:07.609
What?

59:07.611 --> 59:09.077
And Harold Bloomguard.

59:09.079 --> 59:10.212
Oh!

59:10.848 --> 59:12.180
Goddamn!

59:13.584 --> 59:16.652
Oh! Shit! Shit!

59:17.121 --> 59:18.987
Goddamn!

59:19.657 --> 59:22.224
Oh, goddamn!

59:22.226 --> 59:25.561
Okay. You're under arrest.
I just wanted you to know.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.829
Goddamn! Did you hear that?

59:28.732 --> 59:30.766
Police!

59:30.768 --> 59:34.236
Leave it to the police department to
hire a cockroach like you!

59:34.238 --> 59:36.638
Cockroach. Very nice.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.774
Huh. I happen to be a special undercover
officer for the vice department

59:38.776 --> 59:39.708
and I busted you.

59:39.710 --> 59:41.610
Oh, shit!

59:41.612 --> 59:43.245
Come on, get outside
and get in my car, please.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.980
All right, now I'm sorry about this.

59:44.982 --> 59:46.648
- Shit!
- I'm sorry, but it's my job.

59:46.650 --> 59:48.250
Sorry about your baby, young lady,

59:48.251 --> 59:49.851
but it's my duty as a police officer,
you understand?

59:49.853 --> 59:52.254
- Let's go. Get in my car please.
- Shit! Goddamn.

59:53.657 --> 59:54.723
Rape!

59:57.795 --> 59:59.261
Rape!

59:59.263 --> 1:00:02.230
- Rape!
- Rape!

1:00:02.232 --> 1:00:05.734
Rape! Rape! Rape!

1:00:05.736 --> 1:00:08.737
Uh, now wait, ladies. Uh, come back.

1:00:08.739 --> 1:00:11.873
This isn't going well.
You're resisting arrest.

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:15.744
Rape! Come on, baby, run!

1:00:15.746 --> 1:00:17.079
Goddamn!

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:21.817
Rape!

1:00:21.819 --> 1:00:22.751
Ladies, I've got my gun out
and I mean it.

1:00:22.753 --> 1:00:23.619
Rape!

1:00:24.755 --> 1:00:25.854
Come on!

1:00:29.093 --> 1:00:31.360
Rape! Rape!

1:00:50.948 --> 1:00:53.649
Ten radio calls going on you.

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:56.318
People see a madman stealing purses
and chasing two women

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:58.186
with his dong hanging out!

1:01:05.996 --> 1:01:08.363
You two! First night on vice
and look at yous!

1:01:08.365 --> 1:01:11.733
Swacked! Suckin' up bourbon, huh?

1:01:11.735 --> 1:01:13.869
I was drinking scotch, Scuz.

1:01:13.871 --> 1:01:16.938
Shut up, Lyles!

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:19.741
Uh, I'm going to tell you
three turkeys somethin'.

1:01:19.743 --> 1:01:23.412
You better pay attention because I'm
gonna supervise you personal.

1:01:23.414 --> 1:01:26.415
Make sure you stay alive
your time here.

1:01:26.417 --> 1:01:28.383
Slate! Slate!

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:30.986
You and Lyles, you better control
your boozin'.

1:01:30.988 --> 1:01:32.454
You hear that?

1:01:32.456 --> 1:01:33.789
Yes, sergeant.

1:01:33.791 --> 1:01:35.357
Don't call me sergeant!

1:01:37.961 --> 1:01:40.696
Ah, another thing I'd like to know.

1:01:40.698 --> 1:01:42.931
How'd that Pete Zoony
get that knot on his head?

1:01:46.403 --> 1:01:47.335
Huh?

1:01:51.341 --> 1:01:54.910
Lot of fucking mysteries
going on around here.

1:01:54.912 --> 1:01:57.946
I ought to kick ass! There's a lot of
vice sergeants in this town

1:01:57.948 --> 1:02:00.048
that'd pat you on the butt
and write you, "atta boy!"

1:02:00.050 --> 1:02:02.150
For bringing down those whores.

1:04:10.948 --> 1:04:12.180
Kimmy.

1:04:13.984 --> 1:04:15.317
Kimberly.

1:04:19.556 --> 1:04:21.256
You awake, honey?

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:26.494
Sure, Sam.

1:04:26.496 --> 1:04:28.496
I'm always awake at 5:00 in the morning.

1:04:29.166 --> 1:04:30.332
Sure.

1:04:31.935 --> 1:04:33.168
Kimmy.

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:42.878
You feel something?

1:04:43.614 --> 1:04:44.913
Mmm-hmm.

1:04:46.316 --> 1:04:47.983
It'll keep you awake.

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:53.288
Only if you stick it in my eye.

1:04:58.528 --> 1:05:01.663
All right, let's see what
these jokers want.

1:05:20.651 --> 1:05:22.651
Yeah, you wanted to see me, lieutenant?

1:05:22.653 --> 1:05:25.020
Ah, yes, Whalen.

1:05:39.303 --> 1:05:41.002
Knuckles Garrity.

1:05:42.172 --> 1:05:44.306
Who took this down?

1:05:44.308 --> 1:05:46.374
Uh...

1:05:46.376 --> 1:05:48.910
Captain Drobeck said we can't hang this
in the station

1:05:48.911 --> 1:05:51.445
alongside the pictures of the other
officers killed in the line of duty.

1:05:51.448 --> 1:05:53.615
Why not? Why the hell not?

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:55.517
Well, Captain Drobeck...

1:05:55.519 --> 1:05:58.520
Look, Officer Garrity killed himself,
for God's sake!

1:06:01.658 --> 1:06:05.593
Knuckles Garrity taught me that all a
good cop needs is common sense,

1:06:05.595 --> 1:06:09.164
a sense of humor and
a little compassion.

1:06:09.166 --> 1:06:10.665
Now he was a cop for 32 years

1:06:10.667 --> 1:06:15.003
and he finally lost his sense of humor.

1:06:15.005 --> 1:06:18.673
That means he died as a direct result
of his police duties,

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:20.976
and that gelding of a captain ought to
be proud to hang his picture

1:06:20.978 --> 1:06:22.544
on the wall in this station.

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:24.479
I'm saving your ass on this one, Whalen.

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:26.481
That could be five days off your pay.

1:06:28.251 --> 1:06:30.652
I'm sorry, Whalen, the captain...

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:46.267
I got a little job that will take
about an hour,

1:06:46.269 --> 1:06:49.671
then you take off. Go to Dodger Stadium,
badge your way in.

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:52.107
The Reds are playin'.
You're on your own.

1:06:52.109 --> 1:06:55.210
Hey, Scuz, you believe this kid?

1:06:55.746 --> 1:06:57.545
He's a fruit.

1:06:57.547 --> 1:06:59.614
He propositioned me in the park.

1:06:59.616 --> 1:07:00.548
We can close the complaint now.

1:07:04.187 --> 1:07:06.755
Well, maybe you can
help him stop crying.

1:07:09.259 --> 1:07:11.426
Hey, kid...

1:07:11.428 --> 1:07:12.727
What's his name, Pete?

1:07:12.729 --> 1:07:16.464
Uh, Blaney.
Alexander Blaney.

1:07:16.466 --> 1:07:19.034
I almost had to take him to juvenile.

1:07:19.036 --> 1:07:20.702
He's only 18 years old.

1:07:22.105 --> 1:07:23.571
Kid... Alexander.

1:07:26.143 --> 1:07:28.543
Try to stop crying, okay?
You want somethin'?

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.113
You wanna call your mother?

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:35.750
Make him call his mom.

1:07:37.487 --> 1:07:39.587
Take those irons off, too.

1:07:44.361 --> 1:07:48.229
Look, the lady calls
herself Ms. Summers.

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:52.400
Just moved into terrace towers.

1:07:52.402 --> 1:07:56.771
A snitch says she does two, three
tricks a night.

1:07:56.773 --> 1:07:58.706
Her services are very special.

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:00.809
Supposedly has a chamber of horrors.

1:08:00.811 --> 1:08:04.312
Thumb screws, bands, saws.

1:08:04.314 --> 1:08:09.184
Usually, her customers settle for a
plain spanking with the whip.

1:08:09.186 --> 1:08:11.086
She supposedly gets
up to a grand a trick.

1:08:11.822 --> 1:08:13.688
$1,000 a trick?

1:08:15.225 --> 1:08:16.791
That's two or three grand a night.

1:08:16.793 --> 1:08:20.161
Nothing. Roscoe Rules'd
take the job for free.

1:08:20.163 --> 1:08:21.496
Hey, officer...

1:08:21.498 --> 1:08:22.764
Come here, Pete.

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:25.200
I'll see you guys.

1:08:25.202 --> 1:08:26.167
Okay.

1:08:28.138 --> 1:08:29.771
Sit down, kid.

1:08:37.581 --> 1:08:40.715
Hey, you want an ice cream bar?

1:08:40.717 --> 1:08:42.317
Pete, get the kid an ice cream bar.

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:47.155
Jesus, Scuz!

1:08:47.157 --> 1:08:48.790
I'm not a friggin' baby sitter.

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:50.492
He's a kid, Pete.

1:08:51.862 --> 1:08:53.561
Get me one, too. The kind with the nuts.

1:09:00.604 --> 1:09:03.771
Hey, what about me? Am I supposed to
be on a diet?

1:09:23.727 --> 1:09:25.793
Kid, how long have you had
this problem?

1:09:31.535 --> 1:09:34.736
I've... I've known three years
that I'm gay.

1:09:38.942 --> 1:09:41.776
I don't know why I'm gay, I just am.

1:09:43.747 --> 1:09:46.881
My... my mother and father
can't understand that.

1:09:51.555 --> 1:09:53.221
But to be arrested...

1:09:55.525 --> 1:09:56.858
I've never been...

1:10:01.731 --> 1:10:03.765
Look, kid,

1:10:03.767 --> 1:10:05.733
I'm not an expert in this field,

1:10:08.371 --> 1:10:10.738
but I kinda think you should get
some advice.

1:10:16.346 --> 1:10:18.813
If I let you go, you promise
not to go back?

1:10:21.585 --> 1:10:22.717
Yes, sir.

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:27.522
Get out of here.

1:11:01.858 --> 1:11:03.925
You know, this hooker reminds me
of somebody I know.

1:11:03.927 --> 1:11:07.262
Oh! I hope your friend's sex life
is less exotic.

1:11:09.266 --> 1:11:11.266
Well, they're all sisters at heart.

1:11:11.268 --> 1:11:14.002
It's a drag sitting here like this.

1:11:14.004 --> 1:11:15.803
Maybe it's a phony complaint.

1:11:15.805 --> 1:11:17.538
Why don't we call it off, huh?
Why don't we split?

1:11:33.356 --> 1:11:34.589
Shit, man! Knock his teeth out!

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:41.396
Come on, man. Break his fucking face!
What's wrong with you?

1:11:41.398 --> 1:11:43.298
Kill that son of a bitch!

1:12:04.321 --> 1:12:06.020
You made me bleed, motherfucker.
You're gonna pay.

1:12:06.022 --> 1:12:08.022
'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass.
You understand?

1:12:08.024 --> 1:12:10.658
Anytime, man, anytime.

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:13.328
Ah, shut up, shut up!

1:12:16.833 --> 1:12:18.499
Now who started all of this?

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.935
Her and her daughter are
the ones that do that!

1:12:20.937 --> 1:12:22.937
You're animals, that's what they are.

1:12:22.939 --> 1:12:25.940
Go back to Mexico, bitch!

1:12:25.942 --> 1:12:28.676
I was born here, nigger.

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.378
Go back to Africa!

1:12:32.382 --> 1:12:34.682
All right, all right, all right.

1:12:34.684 --> 1:12:36.918
Let's break this up.

1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:38.886
Come here a minute, will ya?

1:12:42.659 --> 1:12:43.825
I think this nigger is the troublemaker,

1:12:43.827 --> 1:12:45.626
so what do you want to do?

1:12:45.628 --> 1:12:48.496
Well, I think we can quiet 'em down.

1:12:48.498 --> 1:12:50.031
I don't believe they want to fight.

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:52.433
So, let me take the Mexican-American.

1:12:52.435 --> 1:12:53.101
All right, all right.

1:12:56.873 --> 1:12:58.740
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1:12:58.742 --> 1:12:59.874
Come here a minute, would you?

1:13:03.513 --> 1:13:05.913
What are you going to do
about this woman?

1:13:07.684 --> 1:13:09.784
What are you talking about?

1:13:09.786 --> 1:13:11.853
It's them over there.
They're the problem.

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:13.788
Take a walk, will you?

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:19.494
What's your name?

1:13:19.496 --> 1:13:21.496
Look, man, all I want to do

1:13:21.498 --> 1:13:23.731
is go inside and be with my family,
you understand?

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:25.666
I mean, I'm tired of being hassled.

1:13:25.668 --> 1:13:26.868
I work too hard to be pushed around.

1:13:26.870 --> 1:13:28.770
Don't you be telling me
what you want to do.

1:13:28.772 --> 1:13:30.505
I'll tell you what you're gonna do and
when you're gonna do it.

1:13:30.507 --> 1:13:32.006
How'd you like to start
by taking a little trip

1:13:32.008 --> 1:13:33.741
down to the slam right now, huh?

1:13:33.743 --> 1:13:36.010
For what? I mean, I ain't did
a damn thing.

1:13:36.012 --> 1:13:37.712
I mean, what right do you have,
you and your friend...

1:13:37.714 --> 1:13:39.147
I'll take you down there personally

1:13:39.149 --> 1:13:40.982
and book your ass and set your
damn hair on fire

1:13:40.984 --> 1:13:42.817
and throw you in a fag tank.

1:13:42.819 --> 1:13:43.885
How'd you like to start like that, huh?

1:13:43.887 --> 1:13:46.587
- Roscoe...
- What?

1:13:46.589 --> 1:13:49.190
Let me just take care of this man,
all right?

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:52.927
You think about it.

1:13:55.899 --> 1:13:56.998
What's your name?

1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.902
Talk to you here for a second.

1:14:00.904 --> 1:14:04.839
You know, if that little loudmouth bitch
was my old lady,

1:14:04.841 --> 1:14:09.143
I'd just haul the little <i>cholo</i> hooker
back in there and settle all this.

1:14:09.145 --> 1:14:11.579
Why are you doing this, man?

1:14:11.581 --> 1:14:14.782
Twenty years ago, I hit some dude in the
head with a beer bottle,

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:15.983
just for smiling at my woman.

1:14:15.985 --> 1:14:17.985
Yeah, well, you're not leading

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:20.488
the old white fence gang anymore,
are you?

1:14:20.490 --> 1:14:23.090
So why don't you just shake hands with
this nigger and we can get out of here?

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:25.827
Shake hands? I ain't shaking no hands.

1:14:25.829 --> 1:14:28.229
I'll tell you what to do, greaseball.

1:14:28.231 --> 1:14:29.897
Now what do you think you are here,

1:14:29.899 --> 1:14:32.166
middleweight champ of the garbage dump
or something?

1:14:33.503 --> 1:14:35.937
I never let a man talk to me like this.

1:14:35.939 --> 1:14:38.105
Never in my life.

1:14:38.107 --> 1:14:41.609
You better book me now or you better
let me go or...

1:14:41.611 --> 1:14:43.845
Yeah, you just keep talkin'.

1:14:43.847 --> 1:14:47.114
I'm gonna rip that oily little old
moustache right off your face.

1:14:50.487 --> 1:14:52.553
Go ahead, try it.

1:15:27.190 --> 1:15:29.090
Dirty honky motherfuckers!

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:25.646
Gringo greaseball.

1:16:53.142 --> 1:16:55.109
No! No!

1:16:59.749 --> 1:17:01.282
<i>Vamos! Vamonos!</i>

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:03.150
Quick, man, get inside.

1:17:06.756 --> 1:17:08.055
Come on.

1:17:08.057 --> 1:17:09.290
They're coming in the back way.

1:17:11.694 --> 1:17:15.096
All right, check for any back doors.
You guys cover the front.

1:17:15.098 --> 1:17:16.631
Roscoe.

1:17:23.406 --> 1:17:24.872
Roscoe.

1:17:27.644 --> 1:17:30.211
Did you make him do the chicken?

1:18:02.912 --> 1:18:06.080
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

1:18:06.082 --> 1:18:08.783
<i>I'd like to thank the band very much.</i>

1:18:08.785 --> 1:18:12.019
<i>They were in their usual good form.</i>

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:16.757
<i>And now, gentlemen, or rather I
should say, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:18:16.759 --> 1:18:18.759
<i>I give you Deputy Chief Riggs.</i>

1:18:30.106 --> 1:18:32.406
<i>Thank you, captain.</i>

1:18:32.408 --> 1:18:35.376
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, officers,</i>

1:18:38.314 --> 1:18:42.183
<i>I hope you appreciate that you work one</i>
<i>hell of a division.</i>

1:18:43.986 --> 1:18:47.221
<i>I'm speaking specifically</i>
<i>in terms of Officer...</i>

1:18:47.223 --> 1:18:49.724
Excuse me.

1:18:49.726 --> 1:18:50.791
What's his name?

1:18:50.793 --> 1:18:52.126
It's on the citation, sir.

1:18:52.128 --> 1:18:53.227
What did you say?

1:18:53.229 --> 1:18:54.462
It's on the citation, sir.

1:18:54.464 --> 1:18:55.496
Oh. Thank you.

1:18:57.734 --> 1:18:59.967
Excuse me.

1:18:59.969 --> 1:19:04.972
<i>I am speaking specifically</i>
<i>of Officer Roscoe Rules.</i>

1:19:04.974 --> 1:19:07.108
<i> Officer, forward and center.</i>

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:12.279
Can you believe this shit?

1:19:12.281 --> 1:19:14.281
Roscoe Rules handed out towels
at Auschwitz.

1:19:14.283 --> 1:19:17.051
Who said that? Who said that in there?

1:19:17.053 --> 1:19:19.253
I think it was one of the coloreds.
I could tell by the voice.

1:19:19.255 --> 1:19:20.321
Mmm.

1:19:22.892 --> 1:19:24.458
What is this, the-bigot-of-the-month
club?

1:19:28.831 --> 1:19:31.532
<i>Officer Rules,</i>

1:19:31.533 --> 1:19:34.234
<i>you have won the department's monthly</i>
<i>exemplary service citation.</i>

1:19:34.237 --> 1:19:36.904
<i>Before I give this to him,</i>

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:39.373
<i>I'm going to say something</i>
<i>to you people.</i>

1:19:39.375 --> 1:19:41.876
<i>If he were out there on the streets</i>

1:19:41.878 --> 1:19:44.044
<i>and got into a fight with a suspect,</i>

1:19:44.046 --> 1:19:46.046
<i>he wouldn't let his head</i>
<i>get kicked in. No.</i>

1:19:46.048 --> 1:19:48.382
He ought to be arrested on a 794.

1:19:48.384 --> 1:19:49.483
What's that?

1:19:49.485 --> 1:19:52.553
Dispensing bullshit without a license.

1:19:52.555 --> 1:19:56.223
<i>This is an officer that wants to do</i>
<i>something about this town.</i>

1:19:59.195 --> 1:20:00.461
Thank you, sir.

1:20:00.463 --> 1:20:04.098
He ought to be a meter maid
in a pay toilet.

1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:07.802
<i>Before you people hit the streets,</i>

1:20:07.804 --> 1:20:11.172
<i>there is something you should hear that</i>
<i>just came over the news.</i>

1:20:13.476 --> 1:20:17.945
<i>The murderer of officer Nate Crenshaw</i>

1:20:17.947 --> 1:20:21.849
<i>has just been acquitted by a jury.</i>

1:20:21.851 --> 1:20:23.984
<i>Huh?</i>

1:20:23.986 --> 1:20:26.353
<i>The jury chose to believe</i>
<i>the dope dealer</i>

1:20:26.355 --> 1:20:29.857
<i>when he said he thought the </i>
<i>undercover man was a bandit</i>

1:20:29.859 --> 1:20:31.992
<i>and he shot in self-defense.</i>

1:20:31.994 --> 1:20:37.898
<i>Huh? Now that is the world we live in!</i>

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:42.336
<i>What this country needs is a little old-fashioned,</i>
<i>hard-fisted government. Huh?</i>

1:20:43.539 --> 1:20:45.072
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:20:49.045 --> 1:20:50.244
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:20:52.582 --> 1:20:55.916
<i>Thank you, chief, for a most</i>
<i>inspiring speech.</i>

1:20:55.918 --> 1:20:58.853
<i>All right, men, let's go to work.</i>
<i>Dismissed.</i>

1:20:58.855 --> 1:21:01.288
Congratulations, chief.

1:21:14.070 --> 1:21:15.970
Congratulations, chief.

1:21:15.972 --> 1:21:19.006
You've just succeeded in turning 85
even-tempered men

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:21.575
into seething brutal vengeance.

1:21:21.577 --> 1:21:23.177
Thank you, son.

1:21:27.950 --> 1:21:31.218
God damn it, Calvin, those frigging
teeth hurt.

1:21:32.655 --> 1:21:35.422
I can't help it. I ain't bitin' you,
am I?

1:21:35.424 --> 1:21:36.991
Well, he's your partner.

1:21:36.993 --> 1:21:38.626
I ain't got no control over him.

1:21:38.628 --> 1:21:41.962
He's a maniac. Everybody knows that.

1:21:41.964 --> 1:21:43.397
You know, it really gets depressing

1:21:43.399 --> 1:21:45.099
having that goddamn Francis draped
around your neck

1:21:45.101 --> 1:21:46.567
all the time.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:21:49.338 --> 1:21:52.006
God damn you, Francis!

1:21:53.910 --> 1:21:56.210
If he doesn't lay off, I'm going to
go after him.

1:21:56.212 --> 1:21:59.179
Hey, Francis, go back in your hole.
It's still daylight.

1:22:00.516 --> 1:22:03.284
If you think he's bad now,
wait'll he gets...

1:22:03.286 --> 1:22:06.220
No, don't do it, Francis.
Don't do it, Francis.

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:15.963
I'll stuff those goofy teeth up your
skinny ass if you don't knock it off.

1:22:15.965 --> 1:22:17.331
All right!

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:18.565
I shall.

1:22:50.232 --> 1:22:51.966
Now he's really dead.

1:22:59.075 --> 1:23:00.141
What do you say, could you use another

1:23:00.142 --> 1:23:01.208
little choir practice tomorrow night?

1:23:01.210 --> 1:23:03.010
Oh, boy.

1:23:03.012 --> 1:23:04.578
After Roscoe's shootout with the ducks,

1:23:04.580 --> 1:23:06.180
we should stop choir practice.

1:23:06.182 --> 1:23:09.283
Oh, nobody got hurt. But I had a little
talk with Roscoe.

1:23:09.285 --> 1:23:10.651
You're kiddin'?

1:23:10.653 --> 1:23:13.287
No, I told him. No more guns
at choir practice.

1:23:13.289 --> 1:23:15.055
I'm not going to have people
shooting at ducks.

1:23:15.057 --> 1:23:16.156
What did he say?

1:23:16.158 --> 1:23:17.458
He said, "how about shooting at fags?"

1:23:21.364 --> 1:23:22.496
Oh.

1:23:24.133 --> 1:23:26.734
Swing by that Terrace Towers.

1:23:27.636 --> 1:23:29.336
- Terrace Towers?
- Yeah.

1:23:49.725 --> 1:23:51.225
Hey, hey, the light's on.

1:23:52.728 --> 1:23:54.361
Let's wait for a couple of minutes.

1:23:54.363 --> 1:23:57.231
Hey, come on, Sam, we're not working
vice anymore.

1:23:57.233 --> 1:23:59.333
I know. Don't you think I know?

1:24:04.206 --> 1:24:05.172
She just walked by the window.

1:24:05.174 --> 1:24:06.240
Yeah.

1:24:10.413 --> 1:24:12.146
Hey, Sam, wait a minute.

1:24:12.148 --> 1:24:14.081
I think she's got something around
her neck.

1:24:14.083 --> 1:24:16.116
It looks like a belt or a whip
or something.

1:24:16.118 --> 1:24:17.551
No kiddin'!

1:24:18.788 --> 1:24:20.187
She must have a trick up there.

1:24:20.189 --> 1:24:21.555
I'll be damned. It is true.

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:25.426
She's whipping him, Sam.

1:24:25.428 --> 1:24:27.161
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

1:24:36.539 --> 1:24:37.838
You had to come here, didn't you?

1:24:39.508 --> 1:24:41.108
Didn't you, baby?

1:24:41.110 --> 1:24:41.742
Maybe we can bust this chick.

1:24:45.381 --> 1:24:47.548
You want to come here and be with me?

1:24:47.550 --> 1:24:49.283
You wanna be with me, baby?

1:24:49.285 --> 1:24:50.751
Huh? You want it?

1:24:51.454 --> 1:24:52.853
Come on.

1:24:52.855 --> 1:24:54.154
Do you want it?

1:24:54.156 --> 1:24:56.256
Oh, yeah, you want it.

1:24:56.258 --> 1:24:58.358
You want me to play you some music?

1:25:09.572 --> 1:25:11.805
You want it? Tell me that
you want it, baby.

1:25:12.374 --> 1:25:13.440
Ow!

1:25:15.144 --> 1:25:16.677
What are we going to do if she doesn't
answer the door?

1:25:16.679 --> 1:25:17.845
We don't even have a warrant.

1:25:17.847 --> 1:25:19.113
Please.

1:25:23.185 --> 1:25:26.620
It's a customer, baby.
I'll be right back.

1:25:26.622 --> 1:25:28.722
Be right back, baby. Be right back.

1:25:40.669 --> 1:25:41.768
Who is it?

1:25:41.770 --> 1:25:44.138
The assistant manager, Miss Summers.

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:45.205
There's a gas leak on this floor.

1:25:45.207 --> 1:25:45.873
We're evacuating the building.

1:25:51.247 --> 1:25:52.479
Don't move.

1:25:58.654 --> 1:26:00.788
You stay here with my partner.

1:26:00.789 --> 1:26:02.923
I'll have a little talk with your friend
over here, huh?

1:26:25.314 --> 1:26:26.213
Baxter!

1:26:26.215 --> 1:26:27.648
Oh, my God!

1:27:02.251 --> 1:27:03.850
What's going on?

1:27:03.852 --> 1:27:05.953
Oh, don't look at me!

1:27:05.955 --> 1:27:07.487
Is everything all right in there, Sam?

1:27:07.489 --> 1:27:09.623
Harold.

1:27:09.625 --> 1:27:11.825
Yeah, it's... it's okay, Harold.

1:27:17.866 --> 1:27:19.132
It's okay.

1:27:19.133 --> 1:27:20.399
I thought we didn't
work vice anymore, Sam.

1:27:22.338 --> 1:27:23.971
Baxter, why you?

1:27:23.973 --> 1:27:26.406
I don't know. God!

1:27:26.408 --> 1:27:27.808
Do you think I know why?

1:27:30.579 --> 1:27:31.979
Sam, I can't move.

1:27:36.018 --> 1:27:37.651
Will you help me get out of this thing?

1:27:38.754 --> 1:27:40.487
Oh, Baxter, I'm sorry.

1:27:46.395 --> 1:27:47.761
Jesus!

1:27:50.699 --> 1:27:52.866
What did you let her do that to you for?

1:27:55.804 --> 1:27:59.006
I'll... well, I'll...

1:27:59.008 --> 1:28:02.909
I'll kill that hooker. But she's a
friend of yours then.

1:28:02.911 --> 1:28:05.779
She's home free this time.
What are you doing?

1:28:09.418 --> 1:28:10.851
She's not my hooker.

1:28:12.388 --> 1:28:13.387
You paid her, didn't you?

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:15.956
No.

1:28:17.493 --> 1:28:19.026
Lady, everybody gets treated the same.

1:28:19.028 --> 1:28:20.861
You get one dime, one call.

1:28:20.863 --> 1:28:22.496
You wanna call your lawyer, fine.

1:28:22.498 --> 1:28:23.930
If you wanna call your mother,
it's okay with me.

1:28:32.574 --> 1:28:33.840
Could you...

1:28:35.811 --> 1:28:36.977
Could you meet me someplace?

1:28:39.615 --> 1:28:41.381
After you get off duty.

1:28:42.851 --> 1:28:44.818
You know, any place, just...

1:28:46.889 --> 1:28:48.722
Just let me talk to you.

1:28:51.393 --> 1:28:52.459
Baxter,

1:28:55.964 --> 1:28:57.798
what do you want from me, huh?

1:28:59.568 --> 1:29:01.034
I just wanted...

1:29:06.875 --> 1:29:08.975
I don't want anything from you.

1:29:13.649 --> 1:29:14.981
Let's go, Harold.

1:29:14.983 --> 1:29:16.350
Well, what about the call?

1:29:16.352 --> 1:29:18.819
We made a mistake.
God damn it, let's go!

1:29:18.821 --> 1:29:21.088
You get your rocks off doing this,
don't you, you bastards?

1:29:21.090 --> 1:29:22.723
If you had a little peace and quiet
in your own neighborhood,

1:29:22.725 --> 1:29:24.791
you wouldn't come around here!

1:29:26.462 --> 1:29:27.794
Scum!

1:29:27.796 --> 1:29:30.664
You low, scum-sucking freak!

1:29:30.666 --> 1:29:33.500
You groove on pain, huh?
I'll teach you about pain.

1:29:33.502 --> 1:29:35.435
If I ever find out
you're doing this again,

1:29:35.437 --> 1:29:38.572
I'll come back and break your
fuckin' legs!

1:29:38.574 --> 1:29:39.840
Can you dig it?

1:29:47.015 --> 1:29:49.649
You move out of this town. Fast!

1:30:17.446 --> 1:30:18.912
- Hey, Tom?
- Yeah.

1:30:18.914 --> 1:30:20.647
What time you got?

1:30:21.850 --> 1:30:23.850
I got two minutes after 4:00.

1:30:25.687 --> 1:30:27.020
Hey, cool it.

1:30:48.076 --> 1:30:49.609
Baxter Slate is dead.

1:30:57.853 --> 1:31:00.053
They just found him in his apartment.

1:31:01.857 --> 1:31:03.023
He...

1:31:03.892 --> 1:31:05.225
He shot himself.

1:31:52.508 --> 1:31:54.941
Um...

1:31:54.943 --> 1:31:56.977
I'd like to see the
death report on that.

1:31:59.214 --> 1:32:02.582
I can't go into homicide cases.

1:32:02.584 --> 1:32:05.151
I'd like to see the death report,
please, Yanov.

1:32:06.588 --> 1:32:08.688
No.

1:32:08.690 --> 1:32:10.757
You don't want to see it, Sam.

1:32:15.797 --> 1:32:16.663
Excuse me.

1:32:42.591 --> 1:32:45.225
Johnson, O'Brien, 10-D-19.

1:32:50.866 --> 1:32:52.265
Landlady heard the shot.

1:32:53.035 --> 1:32:54.100
Where'd you hear that?

1:33:01.743 --> 1:33:04.044
A detective with West L.A.
is a friend of mine.

1:33:04.046 --> 1:33:05.111
What did he say?

1:33:10.218 --> 1:33:11.318
Nothing.

1:33:19.061 --> 1:33:21.127
Next of kin is his mother.

1:33:24.700 --> 1:33:26.166
She's in Hawaii or someplace

1:33:26.168 --> 1:33:28.168
with her 22-year-old boyfriend.

1:33:29.137 --> 1:33:30.203
Jesus.

1:33:42.184 --> 1:33:44.250
Oh, shit!

1:33:47.222 --> 1:33:49.289
I knew things could get worse.

1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:53.960
Ha! You're all under arrest.

1:33:56.898 --> 1:33:58.898
Oh, just couldn't go back to the station

1:33:58.900 --> 1:34:01.368
without stopping by
to tell you all something.

1:34:01.370 --> 1:34:03.136
Tell us what, Roscoe?

1:34:06.642 --> 1:34:11.077
Well, I ran into this homicide dick down
at central that you know.

1:34:13.649 --> 1:34:14.981
You know what he told me?

1:34:19.388 --> 1:34:22.889
Um, he told me that when they posted

1:34:22.891 --> 1:34:25.992
Baxter Slate's body down there at
the coroner's office...

1:34:25.994 --> 1:34:27.160
You remember your partner, don't you?

1:34:30.799 --> 1:34:32.699
He said he had whip marks
all over the back of him.

1:34:36.905 --> 1:34:38.071
Whip marks!

1:34:41.076 --> 1:34:42.308
Whip marks!

1:34:46.381 --> 1:34:48.314
He was some kind of a damn pervert!

1:35:01.029 --> 1:35:03.830
What did you do, kill him,
you motherfucker?

1:35:03.832 --> 1:35:04.864
Sam, cool it.

1:35:06.902 --> 1:35:10.770
Roscoe is an asshole,
but he didn't kill Baxter.

1:35:10.772 --> 1:35:12.372
All right, Lyles, come on, you...

1:35:12.374 --> 1:35:15.842
- Shut up!
- Roscoe!

1:35:15.844 --> 1:35:18.978
Now if you don't collect your mind
and relax, I'm gonna relax ya!

1:35:18.980 --> 1:35:20.280
Come on!

1:35:20.282 --> 1:35:22.115
You'd better let go of me, Dean.

1:35:34.029 --> 1:35:35.361
Fuck you!

1:36:19.875 --> 1:36:24.110
Sam, let's talk.

1:36:25.947 --> 1:36:28.047
I've got nothing to talk about.

1:36:30.418 --> 1:36:31.785
I think we have to.

1:36:36.024 --> 1:36:37.490
God damn you, Harold.

1:36:39.494 --> 1:36:40.360
I want to help.

1:36:41.496 --> 1:36:42.462
Help?

1:36:43.532 --> 1:36:44.864
Leave me alone.

1:36:55.076 --> 1:36:56.442
Come on, partner.

1:36:56.444 --> 1:36:59.045
I can't even get drunk.

1:36:59.047 --> 1:37:01.414
Spencer didn't have any trouble.

1:37:09.124 --> 1:37:10.223
All right, watch his head.

1:37:15.997 --> 1:37:19.999
We'll just set fire to him
and forget about it, huh?

1:37:20.001 --> 1:37:21.167
No, no, leave the door open.

1:37:21.169 --> 1:37:23.336
He needs all the air he can get.

1:37:28.510 --> 1:37:33.213
Roscoe, cool it with the hard stuff.

1:37:33.215 --> 1:37:35.582
Standing there in uniform
in case you didn't know.

1:37:35.584 --> 1:37:38.551
And that funny little wagon over there
is a police...

1:38:21.997 --> 1:38:23.062
Harold?

1:38:24.299 --> 1:38:25.565
Is that you?

1:38:29.070 --> 1:38:30.470
Is that you, <i>padre?</i>

1:38:33.909 --> 1:38:34.974
Who is it?

1:38:34.976 --> 1:38:36.109
What's...

1:38:37.445 --> 1:38:38.678
What's going on?

1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:54.227
Go to sleep.

1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:00.466
Give me a vodka.

1:39:00.468 --> 1:39:02.969
I'd like to know where all this pussy is
that's going to show up.

1:39:02.971 --> 1:39:05.004
- You want somethin'?
- Yes, it's there.

1:39:05.006 --> 1:39:08.207
Let's start getting some of this shit
back in the car.

1:39:08.209 --> 1:39:09.475
Come on, Grease, you pick that up.

1:39:19.321 --> 1:39:22.488
Roscoe sure is a charmer, isn't he?

1:39:22.490 --> 1:39:24.657
That's what you gotta put up with
when the booze is free.

1:39:30.031 --> 1:39:32.498
Oh, that's great. We got two of them
in there now.

1:39:34.002 --> 1:39:36.035
Look at 'em, spilling all this.

1:39:36.037 --> 1:39:38.604
Put that in there.

1:39:38.606 --> 1:39:41.407
Get back before they spill
all the rest of it.

1:39:56.057 --> 1:39:57.190
Aah!

1:40:04.666 --> 1:40:06.632
Oh, my God, I can't breathe!

1:40:14.009 --> 1:40:14.674
Harold!

1:40:23.084 --> 1:40:24.250
Help me.

1:40:30.291 --> 1:40:31.391
Let me talk to you.

1:40:33.194 --> 1:40:34.460
Baxter!

1:40:36.097 --> 1:40:36.763
Baxter!

1:40:41.536 --> 1:40:42.702
Help!

1:40:42.704 --> 1:40:45.138
God! Oh, God, help me!

1:41:00.722 --> 1:41:02.522
Guess what we got now?

1:41:02.524 --> 1:41:05.825
Damn scrote Lyles asleep back there
with Spencer in the van.

1:41:05.827 --> 1:41:08.795
We're gonna have two of 'em
to wash up now.

1:41:08.797 --> 1:41:10.663
Did you close the door to the wagon?

1:41:10.665 --> 1:41:12.632
Oh, no, I just left it wide open.

1:41:12.634 --> 1:41:13.633
Sam doesn't like to be closed in.

1:41:17.705 --> 1:41:20.073
Somebody help me, please.

1:41:22.110 --> 1:41:23.076
Baxter!

1:41:37.459 --> 1:41:38.691
Oh, my God!

1:41:44.499 --> 1:41:46.332
He shot a park faggot.

1:41:49.804 --> 1:41:51.437
It's okay, it's okay.

1:41:51.439 --> 1:41:53.206
What happened?

1:41:53.208 --> 1:41:56.175
...three, four, five.

1:41:56.177 --> 1:41:57.510
Wait a minute. I'm just gonna...

1:41:57.512 --> 1:41:58.811
Is it okay?

1:42:01.649 --> 1:42:03.382
Come on, boy.

1:42:03.384 --> 1:42:06.886
One, two, three, four, five.

1:42:06.888 --> 1:42:10.423
Oh, you guys are doing
a hell of a job there.

1:42:10.425 --> 1:42:12.258
- One, two...
- Shut up!

1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:13.826
...four, five.

1:42:13.828 --> 1:42:16.195
Spermwhale. Spermwhale.

1:42:16.197 --> 1:42:17.497
You're wasting your time.

1:42:25.507 --> 1:42:26.672
What the hell are we going to do now?

1:42:29.477 --> 1:42:31.744
All right, I'm going to take Sam back
to the station.

1:42:31.746 --> 1:42:34.614
And I'm going to tell them that just he
and I were alone in the park, you know.

1:42:34.616 --> 1:42:37.783
We stopped by after watch
to have a couple of beers.

1:42:37.785 --> 1:42:39.585
And I guess we had one too many.

1:42:39.587 --> 1:42:43.422
We got drunk and he fell over,

1:42:43.424 --> 1:42:44.924
and when he fell he broke his glasses.

1:42:44.926 --> 1:42:46.926
Yeah, what about the gun?

1:42:46.928 --> 1:42:48.461
He dropped his gun when he fell, right?

1:42:48.463 --> 1:42:50.663
And as he picked it up,
this kid was walking by,

1:42:50.665 --> 1:42:52.932
some park fairy,

1:42:52.934 --> 1:42:54.734
and he accidentally pulled the trigger
and he blew the kid away.

1:42:54.736 --> 1:42:57.336
What about the glass and the blood
in the truck?

1:42:57.338 --> 1:42:58.771
Uh, we'll take care of that.

1:42:58.773 --> 1:43:01.674
Wait a minute. The gun was fired
five times though.

1:43:01.676 --> 1:43:02.842
That's right. So I'm going to replace

1:43:02.844 --> 1:43:05.511
four of the shells from Sam's piece

1:43:05.513 --> 1:43:07.613
with live rounds from my own.

1:43:07.615 --> 1:43:09.448
It's no fuckin' good. It won't work.

1:43:09.450 --> 1:43:12.285
But I'll tell you what will work.
Sam and I were...

1:43:12.287 --> 1:43:14.787
Spermwhale, you better take
a look at Sam.

1:43:23.831 --> 1:43:25.631
I'll say I was here.

1:43:25.633 --> 1:43:27.967
Don't be an asshole.

1:43:27.969 --> 1:43:31.337
It was just Sam and me, and I saw Sam
take his gun and...

1:43:31.339 --> 1:43:33.606
Damn it, Spermwhale, you've got 20 years
to protect.

1:43:33.608 --> 1:43:35.308
You're as good as pissing your pension
right down the sewer

1:43:35.310 --> 1:43:37.510
if you open your mouth.

1:43:37.511 --> 1:43:39.711
Francis is right. You can't get
involved, Spermwhale.

1:43:42.717 --> 1:43:46.219
It'll be okay if everybody just
keeps their mouth shut.

1:43:47.989 --> 1:43:50.790
And you let me handle it. All right?

1:43:57.332 --> 1:43:57.997
Spermwhale?

1:44:07.742 --> 1:44:08.808
Spencer, are you with us?

1:44:11.512 --> 1:44:13.412
Let's get the hell out of here.

1:44:13.414 --> 1:44:14.614
Come on, Sam. Let's beat it.

1:44:22.757 --> 1:44:25.458
He did what? Now wait a minute. When?

1:44:26.561 --> 1:44:28.027
Oh, go fuck yourself!

1:44:34.402 --> 1:44:35.768
Lyles is in a psycho ward.

1:44:35.770 --> 1:44:39.305
One of Treadwell's detectives
sent him in. Can you...

1:44:39.307 --> 1:44:41.040
Well, he ought to get 10 days
suspension for that.

1:44:41.042 --> 1:44:44.944
Ten days? I'll give him a fuckin' 30
days if I get my hands on him.

1:44:44.946 --> 1:44:47.747
Some shrink at general hospital
says he's catatonic.

1:44:47.749 --> 1:44:49.782
Won't let us talk to him!

1:44:50.618 --> 1:44:52.318
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1:44:54.422 --> 1:44:56.822
What about that, uh, Bloomguard?

1:44:56.824 --> 1:44:58.758
He's still sticking to his story, sir.

1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:00.593
Well, that stinks. It's fishy.

1:45:00.595 --> 1:45:02.211
I tell you it's shit. There's a cover-up
going on.

1:45:02.212 --> 1:45:03.828
I won't let those bastards get away
with it. I want their names.

1:45:03.831 --> 1:45:05.398
The IAD Will get them, sir.

1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:07.733
No IAD. No outside investigation.

1:45:11.372 --> 1:45:12.972
You've told the chief about this,
haven't you?

1:45:14.976 --> 1:45:16.709
I haven't told him a goddamn thing.

1:45:16.711 --> 1:45:18.711
You out of your fuckin' mind?

1:45:18.713 --> 1:45:20.196
What do you want me to say to him?

1:45:20.197 --> 1:45:21.680
I can't handle the men
in my own divisions.

1:45:21.683 --> 1:45:23.582
They're out shooting up
MacArthur Park at night.

1:45:23.584 --> 1:45:25.951
He'd have my ass, for Christ's sake!

1:45:25.953 --> 1:45:28.354
Shit.

1:45:28.356 --> 1:45:30.856
You're going to have to tell him
before the day is out.

1:45:30.858 --> 1:45:32.458
I know, I know.

1:45:34.329 --> 1:45:36.929
Sir, when I worked Fairfax,

1:45:36.931 --> 1:45:40.466
Lyles and Bloomguard used to hang around
with a bunch of creeps.

1:45:40.468 --> 1:45:43.803
Including the one who shot himself.

1:45:43.805 --> 1:45:45.971
And a fat slob by the name of Whalen.

1:45:51.012 --> 1:45:52.778
I'd get Whalen in and sweat him.

1:46:00.121 --> 1:46:03.756
I'm not going to try to fool an old
veteran like you, Whalen.

1:46:03.758 --> 1:46:05.925
I'm not going to try to fool you
about anything.

1:46:06.894 --> 1:46:09.929
<i>That's good, chief,</i>

1:46:09.931 --> 1:46:10.963
<i>'cause I ain't got nothin' to say.</i>

1:46:12.834 --> 1:46:14.567
Do you expect us to believe that?

1:46:14.569 --> 1:46:16.936
I don't give a fuck what you believe.

1:46:21.576 --> 1:46:24.543
Ooh! Quite a record here.

1:46:25.847 --> 1:46:27.580
A history of insubordination.

1:46:27.582 --> 1:46:29.648
No wonder you've been
on patrol for 20 years.

1:46:29.650 --> 1:46:31.584
I like working patrol.

1:46:34.589 --> 1:46:36.155
Did I just say 20 years?

1:46:36.157 --> 1:46:38.657
I'm sorry.

1:46:38.659 --> 1:46:40.726
Nineteen and a half. I forgot.

1:46:43.464 --> 1:46:46.932
I mean, that close to your
20-year pension.

1:46:46.934 --> 1:46:49.168
And now what do you get?

1:46:49.170 --> 1:46:50.469
Nothing.

1:46:54.575 --> 1:46:56.041
- Listen, chief...
- No, no.

1:46:56.043 --> 1:46:58.544
No, you listen to me.

1:46:58.546 --> 1:47:01.847
Now maybe Lyles wasted that faggot
practicing his quick draw,

1:47:01.849 --> 1:47:04.917
or maybe he was practicing shooting at
beer bottles and the fruit happened by.

1:47:04.919 --> 1:47:08.120
I don't know how it happened
and I don't really care.

1:47:08.122 --> 1:47:09.688
But what I do care about is the truth

1:47:09.690 --> 1:47:11.757
and I'm gonna get it out of every
man that was there

1:47:11.759 --> 1:47:14.693
or I'm gonna push for an involuntary
manslaughter against Lyles

1:47:14.695 --> 1:47:18.497
and you're gonna have your ass on trial
as accessory after the fact.

1:47:25.106 --> 1:47:27.139
If you know so much, what are you
fucking with me for.

1:47:27.141 --> 1:47:29.742
Because I got you right by the balls,
that's why.

1:47:31.546 --> 1:47:34.480
I'm trying to help you out.
Look, you're 53 years old.

1:47:34.482 --> 1:47:36.882
You're an old, crude, fat man.

1:47:38.453 --> 1:47:40.052
You're fired from here,
where do you go?

1:47:40.054 --> 1:47:43.022
You'll look for a job? Doing what?

1:47:43.024 --> 1:47:45.891
You couldn't get a job
cleaning out shithouses.

1:47:45.893 --> 1:47:48.561
And not a dime of your pension
after almost 20 years.

1:47:48.563 --> 1:47:50.963
Not a dime! Ha!

1:47:54.702 --> 1:47:56.969
Oh. Yeah, I forgot.

1:48:00.241 --> 1:48:02.541
We found a very interesting fingerprint

1:48:02.543 --> 1:48:05.010
on a bourbon bottle
out there in the park.

1:48:06.948 --> 1:48:08.147
Guess who?

1:48:12.220 --> 1:48:13.853
Now I am willing to make a deal.

1:48:13.855 --> 1:48:15.254
I want the whole story on this.

1:48:15.256 --> 1:48:18.724
You give it to me and you're out,
you're free.

1:48:18.726 --> 1:48:20.693
You get your pension.

1:48:20.695 --> 1:48:22.495
We wipe off the last six months
you've got left to serve.

1:48:28.069 --> 1:48:30.135
You want me to say I was there?

1:48:30.137 --> 1:48:33.939
I know you were there! I want to know
who was there with you.

1:48:33.941 --> 1:48:36.108
- What?
- Names! I want names!

1:48:38.579 --> 1:48:40.613
Christ sakes...

1:48:40.615 --> 1:48:42.114
Look, I want to nail these guys
once and forever.

1:48:42.116 --> 1:48:44.183
You can slip out of town.
They won't know you did it.

1:48:44.185 --> 1:48:45.918
You can go where the fuck you want.

1:48:54.662 --> 1:48:56.295
No, God damn it, I can't.

1:48:58.132 --> 1:49:01.033
You can't, huh?

1:49:01.035 --> 1:49:03.235
Well, you don't, you'll find yourself
in front of a trial board

1:49:03.237 --> 1:49:05.704
and you're gonna have
criminal prosecution!

1:49:05.706 --> 1:49:07.806
Now I promise you that.

1:49:07.808 --> 1:49:10.276
And you won't have
one goddamn thing left

1:49:10.278 --> 1:49:14.580
after 19 and a half years
down the crapper!

1:49:14.582 --> 1:49:16.749
I'll throw the fuckin' world at you.

1:49:19.820 --> 1:49:22.688
Now you got five minutes
to make up your mind.

1:50:00.161 --> 1:50:01.994
Hi, Tommy, how's it going?

1:50:01.996 --> 1:50:05.297
Not bad. How's the supplies
holding out?

1:50:05.299 --> 1:50:08.367
We're gonna need some stuff.
I'll give you a list.

1:50:08.369 --> 1:50:10.102
I could have used you out there today.

1:50:10.104 --> 1:50:11.837
Engine's acting up.

1:50:11.839 --> 1:50:13.005
Why don't I check with you later?

1:50:13.007 --> 1:50:14.707
John, how are ya?

1:50:21.716 --> 1:50:24.083
Hi, Spermwhale. Here's your mail.

1:50:24.085 --> 1:50:25.317
Hiya, John, how are you doin'?

1:50:25.319 --> 1:50:28.087
- How's fishin'?
- Ah! Half a ton, maybe.

1:50:28.089 --> 1:50:29.955
- Not good, huh?
- No.

1:50:29.957 --> 1:50:32.124
Well, there's this about fishing.

1:50:32.126 --> 1:50:35.027
There's always hope the next time out
it'll be better.

1:50:35.029 --> 1:50:36.762
- Uh-huh.
- See you now.

1:50:36.764 --> 1:50:38.297
I'll see ya, John.

1:51:14.068 --> 1:51:16.702
<i>Dear Spermwhale,</i>

1:51:16.703 --> 1:51:19.337
<i>who let you out of town before we had</i>
<i>a chance to say some things.</i>

1:51:24.278 --> 1:51:26.679
<i>The guys have had it here.</i>

1:51:26.681 --> 1:51:30.683
<i>They're at the bottom of the pit.</i>
<i>All except me.</i>

1:51:30.685 --> 1:51:34.019
<i>It was the first time I was ever lucky</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

1:51:34.021 --> 1:51:36.689
<i>I was in night court.</i>

1:51:36.691 --> 1:51:39.858
<i>So I'm the only guy that's</i>
<i>not being penalized.</i>

1:51:39.860 --> 1:51:43.195
<i>The rest are all pleading guilty</i>
<i>to what the brass wants.</i>

1:51:43.197 --> 1:51:45.431
<i>I'm working every day,</i>

1:51:45.433 --> 1:51:48.200
<i>and because I am, the guys asked me</i>
<i>to tell you</i>

1:51:48.202 --> 1:51:50.369
<i>that they don't hold it against you.</i>

1:51:57.945 --> 1:52:00.713
<i>You left without talking to us.</i>

1:52:00.715 --> 1:52:03.816
<i>That was because you were ashamed</i>
<i>to see us.</i>

1:52:03.818 --> 1:52:05.818
<i>But don't be.</i>

1:52:05.820 --> 1:52:08.353
<i>You did the only thing you could.</i>

1:52:08.355 --> 1:52:10.989
<i>You beat the system.</i>

1:52:10.991 --> 1:52:13.225
<i>We'd have all done the same thing.</i>

1:52:13.227 --> 1:52:15.961
<i>There isn't any one of us</i>
<i>regrets you did it.</i>

1:52:18.766 --> 1:52:21.033
<i>Good luck. Good fishing. Calvin.</i>

1:52:30.478 --> 1:52:34.446
<i>P.S. I cut this article</i>
<i>out of the</i> times.

1:52:34.448 --> 1:52:36.749
<i>It's the story that chief Riggs</i>
<i>gave to the paper</i>

1:52:36.751 --> 1:52:38.517
<i>about what happened that night.</i>

1:52:55.469 --> 1:52:57.402
And you got this from the Monterey
newspaper?

1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:01.840
Why'd you release that story?

1:53:01.842 --> 1:53:03.342
You had the truth. You told a lie.

1:53:03.344 --> 1:53:05.277
What did you want me to do?

1:53:05.279 --> 1:53:07.813
Asshole, what did you
expect him to release?

1:53:07.815 --> 1:53:10.249
That eight drunken cops were accessories
to a murder?

1:53:10.251 --> 1:53:12.050
That's 10 years in prison.

1:53:12.052 --> 1:53:13.252
What are you going to
say about that, huh?

1:53:13.254 --> 1:53:15.254
And what's he got them on?

1:53:15.256 --> 1:53:16.522
Trumped-up charges.

1:53:16.524 --> 1:53:18.390
They're getting six months suspensions.

1:53:18.392 --> 1:53:21.093
That's a damn sight less than they
deserve and you know it.

1:53:21.095 --> 1:53:23.128
Bullshit six months.

1:53:23.130 --> 1:53:25.798
Come on, Spermwhale, this man's got
very important things to do.

1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:26.932
Let's get out of here. Come on.

1:53:26.934 --> 1:53:28.433
They showed you up an asshole, Riggs.

1:53:28.435 --> 1:53:30.536
You can't take care of your own store.

1:53:30.538 --> 1:53:33.272
And you'll crucify these guys
when they get back.

1:53:33.274 --> 1:53:35.107
Oh, you miserable prick!

1:53:38.479 --> 1:53:39.978
You open this up, it's not too late,

1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:41.346
I can still take your pension.

1:53:44.952 --> 1:53:46.485
You lied to the press.

1:53:48.189 --> 1:53:50.122
You lied to the public.

1:53:50.124 --> 1:53:52.291
Oh, holy shit, chief, he's right.

1:53:52.293 --> 1:53:54.827
What did you expect me to do?

1:53:54.828 --> 1:53:57.362
You lied to your superiors
and the police commission.

1:53:57.364 --> 1:53:59.998
You stone-walled it. Buried it!

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.100
Ah, hey, chief.

1:54:02.102 --> 1:54:04.036
He wants to take your fuckin' pension.

1:54:04.038 --> 1:54:05.838
He wants to send you to jail
and everything.

1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:07.940
Withholding evidence.

1:54:07.942 --> 1:54:10.609
Filing a false murder report.

1:54:10.611 --> 1:54:13.011
Suspending officers on false charges.

1:54:15.082 --> 1:54:18.183
Yeah, that's a criminal
prosecution, Riggs.

1:54:18.185 --> 1:54:20.219
I got his fuckin' pension.

1:54:20.221 --> 1:54:22.187
Ah, you're bluffing. That calls for
a murder charge.

1:54:22.189 --> 1:54:23.455
They haven't got the guts!

1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:27.893
Haven't they?

1:54:29.263 --> 1:54:30.629
Read about it.

1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:35.500
You dumb prick, we'll all go to jail!

1:54:36.604 --> 1:54:38.537
You said it, chief.

1:54:38.539 --> 1:54:39.972
Well, we...

1:54:48.249 --> 1:54:49.548
What do you want?

1:54:50.484 --> 1:54:52.150
You wipe it off the books.

1:54:52.152 --> 1:54:53.952
They've got to take some suspensions.

1:54:53.954 --> 1:54:56.321
No suspensions.

1:54:56.323 --> 1:54:57.956
I can't. It'll look bad!

1:54:57.958 --> 1:55:00.225
Fuck you looking bad. No bad time.

1:55:01.962 --> 1:55:03.528
They go back on patrol tonight

1:55:03.530 --> 1:55:05.030
and you stay off their asses.

1:55:11.438 --> 1:55:14.072
You cocksucker!

1:55:14.074 --> 1:55:15.974
Hey, not me, chief. I'm not the one
on my knees.

1:55:24.985 --> 1:55:26.118
All right!

1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.553
All of it?

1:55:28.555 --> 1:55:31.056
Well, you got what you wanted,
get out of here.

1:55:31.058 --> 1:55:32.457
Son of a bitch!

1:55:34.962 --> 1:55:36.495
Now you owe me a buck.

1:55:49.143 --> 1:55:52.511
But you were bluffing.
You friggin' fucked me!

1:55:52.513 --> 1:55:54.379
You sons of bitches!

1:55:54.381 --> 1:55:57.582
Well, that does it. You are off pension
and you're fired!

1:55:57.584 --> 1:55:59.451
Now that's it.

1:55:59.453 --> 1:56:01.453
Oh, boy, I knew those bastards
didn't have the guts.

1:56:01.455 --> 1:56:03.355
Come on, you're full of shit.

1:56:24.611 --> 1:56:26.611
You don't want to do that, chief.

1:56:27.247 --> 1:56:28.146
You really don't.

1:56:32.353 --> 1:56:33.685
Signed depositions.

1:56:41.395 --> 1:56:42.494
Seven of them.

1:56:52.373 --> 1:56:54.473
I'll see you around, chief.

1:57:12.226 --> 1:57:14.393
Think the chief needs a massage.

1:57:28.509 --> 1:57:31.109
Oh, no, no. Give me five.
