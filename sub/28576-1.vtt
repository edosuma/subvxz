00:00.023 --> 00:01.714
Previously on Harrow...

00:01.778 --> 00:04.097
- Did you kill Robert Quinn?
- Yes.

00:04.391 --> 00:05.474
Why?

00:05.634 --> 00:09.017
You molested her.
You abused my little girl!

00:09.105 --> 00:10.505
She knew what she wanted.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.572
And now I knew Fern's secret,

00:15.831 --> 00:18.491
I couldn't face the chance
of being in jail.

00:18.528 --> 00:20.977
I wanted to be there for her.

00:21.418 --> 00:22.697
So, I got to work.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.413
Does Mum know?

00:25.638 --> 00:27.845
Well, that's not even
bloody close, is it?

00:28.054 --> 00:29.533
They didn't cut that bone.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.998
You shouldn't have interfered!

00:31.034 --> 00:32.670
You made your choice and so did I.

00:32.707 --> 00:33.946
Now we're in it together.

00:33.998 --> 00:35.461
So, don't lie to me again.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.957 --> 01:04.596
Call ahead and get blood ready.

01:05.959 --> 01:09.958
That was very expensive wine...

01:10.118 --> 01:11.621
You're OK. Stay with us.

01:11.711 --> 01:13.870
Keep the pressure on.
He's losing a lot of blood.

01:14.379 --> 01:15.939
Hang in there, mate.

01:17.958 --> 01:20.610
How many bullet wounds?
One. But it's a bad one.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.422
My God! Daniel... Daniel...

01:24.459 --> 01:26.141
Please, we have to
get him in straightaway.

01:31.513 --> 01:33.272
Try to get an art-line in.

01:33.376 --> 01:36.255
He's lost too much. Into Trauma Bypass.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.713
I think his hepatic vein's been hit.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.950
We need five units of O neg now.
Right now!

01:42.987 --> 01:44.666
BP's dropping. We're losing him!

02:37.958 --> 02:40.398
Hell is very floral.

02:44.203 --> 02:46.406
You're assuming hell would have you.

02:46.563 --> 02:48.702
Well, you're here.

02:49.091 --> 02:51.171
I'm beginning to wonder why.

02:52.318 --> 02:54.557
Do you want water, juice?

02:54.745 --> 02:56.091
Whisky.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.727
Sorry.

02:57.958 --> 03:00.438
It's contraindicated by the morphine.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.528
Morphine?

03:03.918 --> 03:05.772
You were in an induced coma.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.760
So, if it was attention
you were after, you missed it all.

03:10.567 --> 03:13.966
Well, at least someone
has a sense of humour.

03:14.054 --> 03:16.054
'Mister Lincoln' roses.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.911
'Cause I was shot, too.

03:20.272 --> 03:21.711
Clean through, apparently.

03:21.753 --> 03:24.179
You... no longer have a gall bladder.

03:25.886 --> 03:28.046
I was rather attached to that.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.591
So, what happened?

03:31.776 --> 03:36.055
I imagine I rubbed someone up
the wrong way.

03:36.214 --> 03:37.694
Hard to believe.

03:39.628 --> 03:41.428
Do you know who?

03:45.664 --> 03:47.544
I have no idea.

04:49.799 --> 04:51.519
Pretty funny, isn't it?

04:53.485 --> 04:54.724
Come here...

04:54.761 --> 04:55.864
Ooh!

04:55.901 --> 04:57.474
Ooh-ooh-ooh! I'm sorry.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.071
That's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

05:06.568 --> 05:08.528
What happened, Dad?

05:10.277 --> 05:12.696
It was probably just an accident.

05:12.888 --> 05:14.848
Someone shooting on the river.

05:15.951 --> 05:18.631
I'm sorry I had you worried.

05:20.178 --> 05:23.520
I, I tried calling your mum.

05:25.814 --> 05:27.494
She'll be OK now.

05:28.106 --> 05:29.716
We both will be.

05:30.666 --> 05:34.149
I'm on my way to work, so I can't stay.

05:35.239 --> 05:36.799
I love you.

05:37.803 --> 05:39.800
I love you too, bub.

05:53.624 --> 05:56.450
It wasn't an accident...

05:56.746 --> 05:58.450
was it?

05:59.391 --> 06:01.191
Someone tried to kill you.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.954
The police will find out who.

06:13.948 --> 06:15.465
Shouldn't you be in bed?

06:15.559 --> 06:18.039
Shouldn't you be chasing people
who like to shoot pathologists?

06:18.196 --> 06:19.705
"A" pathologist.

06:20.085 --> 06:21.925
You didn't happen to see
your shooter, did you?

06:21.998 --> 06:23.705
I'm afraid not. It was dark.

06:23.908 --> 06:25.218
Right. No death threats?

06:25.255 --> 06:26.585
No anonymous warnings?

06:27.358 --> 06:28.785
No-one you pissed off...

06:28.889 --> 06:30.929
lately?

06:33.346 --> 06:35.283
Soroya Dass wasn't happy with me.

06:35.356 --> 06:38.616
Soroya Dass was boarding a flight to
Melbourne at the time you were shot.

06:43.439 --> 06:45.256
Will you pay me back like last time?

06:45.348 --> 06:46.789
Unbelievable.

06:46.826 --> 06:49.366
So, do you have any suspects?

06:50.375 --> 06:52.843
Harrow, the list of people
who'd like to shoot you

06:52.880 --> 06:54.380
would stretch from here to Hobart.

06:54.426 --> 06:56.065
And I'd be on top of that list myself,

06:56.102 --> 06:57.475
were I not in charge of this case

06:57.512 --> 06:59.854
which, quite frankly,
I need like a third armpit.

06:59.925 --> 07:03.546
I am sorry.
I didn't plan on getting shot.

07:09.546 --> 07:11.006
So, what about ballistics?

07:11.107 --> 07:13.066
Well, we haven't found the bullet.
We're looking.

07:13.481 --> 07:16.545
So, to recap - you have no bullet, no
witnesses, no theories and no leads.

07:16.586 --> 07:17.785
I feel very safe.

07:17.822 --> 07:20.228
Look, we're watching your boat,
your phone, your email,

07:20.265 --> 07:21.864
and we are watching you.

07:21.901 --> 07:23.562
And no-one's had another tilt at you.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.320
And are my family alright?

07:25.408 --> 07:27.244
We're watching them too.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.529
So, what am I supposed to do?

07:29.586 --> 07:31.163
Look, just...

07:31.768 --> 07:34.967
go to bed and let us do our job.

07:49.263 --> 07:52.023
Sam, tell the divers to look
further back.

08:38.861 --> 08:40.029
Hi.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.227
Daniel. Hi.

08:42.264 --> 08:45.263
It's raining.
You can't sleep when it rains.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.538
Your memory's OK, then.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.793
Everything's OK.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.671
I thought you might come visit.

08:54.872 --> 08:56.632
I spoke to Fern.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.960
While you were in surgery. She...

09:03.329 --> 09:04.966
she told me what happened.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.745
She told me everything.

09:06.992 --> 09:08.305
About Robert.

09:08.393 --> 09:10.433
What he did and what you...

09:15.264 --> 09:17.857
I don't know what to say to you. I...

09:19.976 --> 09:22.736
Dan, I... I...

09:24.952 --> 09:27.835
I'm so grateful for what you did...

09:28.608 --> 09:30.648
for our daughter, but...

09:32.634 --> 09:35.117
I don't know what to think about you.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.105
You don't have to think anything.

09:38.414 --> 09:39.945
I wanted to see you. I just...

09:40.118 --> 09:42.865
I... I don't think I can yet,
but I'm...

09:43.088 --> 09:44.888
I'm glad that you're OK.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.357
I told you doctors
make the worst patients.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.669
Have you actually been discharged?

10:18.346 --> 10:20.625
It's one thing to nearly die.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.825
It's another to hear you
killing my car.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.485
Have you been using the rest of
my belongings, too?

10:25.509 --> 10:26.607
No.

10:26.644 --> 10:28.329
I mean, you know,
I went through your albums,

10:28.353 --> 10:30.739
picked out the ones I wanted,
in case you snuffed it.

10:31.813 --> 10:35.745
I'm kidding. You don't have any
albums that I actually want! God!

10:36.041 --> 10:37.201
Is that third? I feel like...

10:37.234 --> 10:39.034
No, that's second, that's second.

10:47.758 --> 10:49.358
Thank you.

10:50.026 --> 10:52.785
I hate being cooped up. Right.

10:52.945 --> 10:56.309
That's why you choose to live in
a 35-square-metre floating house.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.287
And Nichols is going to kill me.
You should be going to a hotel.

11:00.324 --> 11:04.004
It's fine. Nichols himself said
they're watching the boat.

11:05.773 --> 11:07.494
Well, I'm glad you're OK.

11:07.639 --> 11:09.479
You had us worried.

11:10.797 --> 11:12.637
All for nothing.

11:14.376 --> 11:17.313
I'm not finished learning
from you yet, you know?

11:22.447 --> 11:24.887
I don't know what the lesson is here.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.933
Call me if you need me.

11:33.754 --> 11:37.143
And I may have broken
your car's tail-light.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.319
Sorry.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.928
Not your type?

13:36.707 --> 13:38.266
Married.

13:38.370 --> 13:40.889
Or so stupid he forgot
to take off his ring.

13:41.748 --> 13:43.785
No, not my type.

13:44.119 --> 13:45.831
When did yours come off?

13:46.356 --> 13:48.795
Quite some time ago.

13:49.447 --> 13:53.367
I promise, I'm really
only here to drink.

13:55.812 --> 13:57.371
What are you doing?

13:57.626 --> 13:59.349
Deleting the dating app.

13:59.859 --> 14:01.945
If an algorithm can't
hit the basic criteria,

14:02.502 --> 14:04.057
I'm better off without it.

14:04.208 --> 14:07.945
Out of curiosity, what
were the basic criteria?

14:09.386 --> 14:11.263
Must have half a brain...

14:11.439 --> 14:12.959
and his own hair.

14:13.524 --> 14:16.603
Must be over six foot, and over his ex.

14:17.144 --> 14:20.624
Not a criminal and
definitely not a doctor.

14:22.906 --> 14:24.385
Doesn't sound that hard.

14:24.479 --> 14:27.105
But the truth is... it is.

14:27.439 --> 14:30.079
Truth sucks.

14:36.987 --> 14:38.363
What the hell.

14:38.408 --> 14:41.169
Mr Truth Sucks, let's play a game.

14:41.386 --> 14:45.385
We each tell each other four
things, but only one is the truth.

14:45.783 --> 14:47.703
Guess wrong, you buy.

14:48.584 --> 14:50.064
I'm game.

14:51.956 --> 14:53.995
I...

14:54.149 --> 14:55.705
grew up here.

14:56.066 --> 14:59.905
I'm a political advisor who
recently lost her job,

15:00.226 --> 15:03.768
even though I was protecting my
former boss from a sexual scandal

15:03.852 --> 15:07.366
involving under 21-year-old
male back-up dancers.

15:07.986 --> 15:09.985
I'm allergic to cashews.

15:10.901 --> 15:12.571
And I still have recurring nightmares

15:12.608 --> 15:15.545
about reversing over my King Charles
Spaniel, Colonel Mustard,

15:15.996 --> 15:17.385
even though I didn't.

15:17.521 --> 15:19.201
He was killed by a possum.

15:20.657 --> 15:23.400
How big was this possum?

15:51.107 --> 15:54.018
- You OK?
- Absolutely.

16:05.386 --> 16:09.544
Only here to drink?

16:35.982 --> 16:37.902
Medium decaf latte.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.562
Large fruit frappe.

16:56.666 --> 16:58.395
No, that's my drink.
I ordered a frappe.

16:58.432 --> 17:01.431
No, that's mine! I need it. I need it!

17:01.666 --> 17:03.186
Excuse me.

17:11.710 --> 17:14.670
I don't like being stared at.

17:16.358 --> 17:19.276
I think you may need to get used to it.

17:32.737 --> 17:34.847
Where did you come from?

17:35.189 --> 17:36.909
Do you like mysteries?

17:41.398 --> 17:43.038
Here's one.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.185
Recent surgery.

17:48.303 --> 17:49.945
Gun running.

17:50.178 --> 17:51.985
Failed circus performer.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.377
Should we lie more?

17:53.414 --> 17:55.094
Would you like to?

18:00.528 --> 18:01.933
The truth is...

18:03.315 --> 18:06.595
I really am...

18:12.872 --> 18:15.392
Can we continue this tonight? Dinner?

18:19.273 --> 18:20.848
I have to go.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.931
First day.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.600
First day for me too.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.325
What are the cabs like around here?

18:29.440 --> 18:31.104
I can give you a lift if you want.

18:31.689 --> 18:34.436
Where are you going?
Not far. Middle of the city.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.174
Me too. Turbot Street.

18:38.215 --> 18:39.855
Where in Turbot Street?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.847
83 Turbot Street.

18:49.622 --> 18:51.435
Thank you all for coming.

18:51.472 --> 18:53.511
It's lovely to see...

18:53.781 --> 18:56.714
MOST of you here

18:56.841 --> 18:59.009
to make welcome the new member
of the QIFM staff,

18:59.046 --> 19:00.645
Dr Grace Molyneux.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.218
We've been looking for another
pathologist for some time now,

19:04.255 --> 19:07.105
so I'm really pleased
that Dr Molyneux has agreed

19:07.142 --> 19:10.880
to finish her final six months
of supervised work here with us.

19:11.002 --> 19:13.745
And I hope, after that, she stays on,

19:13.823 --> 19:15.783
as long as we don't scare her off.

19:18.099 --> 19:20.022
Welcome, Dr Molyneux.

19:22.138 --> 19:25.385
Oops. Hello, hello.

19:25.476 --> 19:27.305
Hell... Hello!

19:27.470 --> 19:30.465
Hello, Grace.
You didn't come home last night.

19:30.781 --> 19:32.140
I was worried.

19:32.217 --> 19:33.745
Everything's fine.

19:34.465 --> 19:38.186
OK, that's it.
Everyone back to it except for you.

19:41.631 --> 19:43.631
Dr Harrow?

19:54.679 --> 19:56.482
Why do we need another pathologist?

19:56.589 --> 19:58.995
You know we've been needing
more good staff.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.053
Now we have one.

20:01.859 --> 20:03.338
What is wrong with Dr Molyneux?

20:03.375 --> 20:04.855
She's rather...

20:05.736 --> 20:06.815
tall.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.059
- Why aren't you in hospital?
- I don't like hospital.

20:09.123 --> 20:11.425
- Why aren't you at home?
- It's boring at home.

20:11.648 --> 20:12.922
Why are you here?

20:12.959 --> 20:14.719
My coffee mug's here.

20:17.745 --> 20:19.746
I thought I'd look over
some old case files

20:19.783 --> 20:22.108
to see who particularly
might have an axe to grind.

20:22.145 --> 20:24.085
There are thousands.

20:24.437 --> 20:26.357
Look, I've gotta do something.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.305
Actually, I'm probably good
to start work again.

20:31.342 --> 20:32.559
No! No, no, no.

20:32.596 --> 20:34.877
I can't reinstate you until
you've had a psych evaluation.

20:34.906 --> 20:36.745
That. Can't we skip that?

20:36.782 --> 20:38.350
You were shot.

20:38.426 --> 20:41.545
You need a psych evaluation
before you can come back to work.

20:41.853 --> 20:45.448
But if it makes you feel better,
look over your old case files.

20:45.559 --> 20:47.425
Reconnect with your mug.

20:47.462 --> 20:49.520
But you're not working.

21:30.144 --> 21:32.332
- Thank you.
- No worries.

21:32.583 --> 21:36.423
We'll get you a computer
and a login.

21:38.350 --> 21:40.189
And maybe a Doberman.

21:40.369 --> 21:41.824
You know she gets an office?

21:41.861 --> 21:44.611
That's because she's a pathologist,
apparently.

21:44.762 --> 21:48.437
Well, I imagine you have an office,
because you are also a pathologist.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.074
Apparently.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.518
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

22:02.231 --> 22:03.470
You were shot!

22:03.507 --> 22:04.945
You're Fairley's girlfriend?!

22:05.126 --> 22:07.697
He's my uncle.

22:08.165 --> 22:10.296
Why didn't you tell me you were shot?

22:10.455 --> 22:11.731
Well, you saw that for yourself.

22:11.755 --> 22:12.985
I saw a neat bandage.

22:13.058 --> 22:15.370
I didn't actually think there was
a whole sordid backstory

22:15.407 --> 22:17.438
involving attempted homicide!

22:19.861 --> 22:21.541
And you're a doctor.

22:22.026 --> 22:24.025
You're a doctor.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.321
Did you have any idea who I was?

22:26.393 --> 22:28.259
I think I'd recall Fairley
mentioning a niece

22:28.304 --> 22:29.943
who'd followed him into pathology.

22:29.997 --> 22:31.102
Really?

22:31.139 --> 22:33.766
Do you recall anything
my uncle mentions?

22:34.466 --> 22:36.399
He warned me to steer clear of you.

22:36.479 --> 22:38.518
- As a pathologist.
- Yes.

22:38.556 --> 22:40.250
Well, this isn't about me
as a pathologist.

22:40.346 --> 22:42.785
- This is about us as...
- Colleagues.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.145
- I'm not your boss.
- You're my supervisor.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.225
Well, one of them.

22:47.643 --> 22:50.225
Come on. You understand.

22:56.202 --> 22:58.042
No dinner then.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.400
No dinner.

23:02.605 --> 23:04.865
Get ready.
The police have shot a young woman.

23:04.915 --> 23:07.142
I'll scrub up. I meant Dr Molyneux.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.706
You stay out of it.

23:47.346 --> 23:49.225
Can I help you?

23:49.382 --> 23:51.711
The police said
someone would meet me here.

23:51.917 --> 23:54.418
My... my wife's been shot and I'm...

23:54.455 --> 23:56.366
here to identify her.

23:56.874 --> 24:00.074
Yes, I'm... I'm sorry,
it's all a bit hectic in there.

24:03.582 --> 24:05.141
So, what do I do?

24:05.364 --> 24:08.217
Someone will be with you shortly.

24:08.557 --> 24:10.357
Please...

24:16.183 --> 24:18.519
Your wife is in there

24:18.700 --> 24:20.705
and... she is dead.

24:21.007 --> 24:22.887
Do you understand that?

24:24.266 --> 24:28.004
So, in a bit, you will see her

24:28.041 --> 24:29.881
and it will not be easy.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.399
But then...

24:32.509 --> 24:34.756
we will look after her, I promise.

24:36.893 --> 24:40.813
Mr Diallo?
I'm sorry, we're ready for you.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.898
Could you look after
my daughter for me?

24:46.935 --> 24:48.415
Yes, yes, of course.

25:05.053 --> 25:07.653
Not exactly the castle we hoped for.

25:09.677 --> 25:13.779
Maybe not, but... at least
it's got four walls

25:13.874 --> 25:15.208
and a lock on the door.

25:15.279 --> 25:18.785
And... Da-dada-da! ..Legit keys!

25:19.143 --> 25:22.214
Legit keys, yay!

25:22.386 --> 25:24.007
And two weeks' rent in advance.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.709
Thanks to your Mum.

25:26.145 --> 25:27.497
OK, but then what?

25:27.534 --> 25:28.985
I'm barely making enough.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.225
It's OK, Fish. It's sorted.

25:31.925 --> 25:33.305
Really?

25:34.325 --> 25:36.109
I just can't tell you yet.

25:36.290 --> 25:37.807
You have to trust me.

25:39.093 --> 25:41.465
How's your Dad? Is he OK?

25:41.751 --> 25:43.671
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

25:49.810 --> 25:51.741
Don't mind me, I'm not even here.

25:51.874 --> 25:53.316
You shouldn't be.

25:53.353 --> 25:56.873
Yes, I agree. You shouldn't be.
You should be in the hospital.

25:58.466 --> 26:01.496
You're worried about me.

26:01.669 --> 26:03.345
I absolutely am not.

26:03.433 --> 26:05.112
Did you come and see me
at the hospital?

26:05.258 --> 26:07.960
No. And I will tell you why.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.516
- Because you think I deserved it.
- No.

26:10.642 --> 26:12.730
Because I think that you invited it.

26:12.866 --> 26:15.144
Whoa, that's a little harsh.

26:15.181 --> 26:17.763
No, it's OK. Fairley's right.

26:18.569 --> 26:21.545
When you go outside these walls,
the safety net disappears,

26:21.586 --> 26:24.380
and you're just another person poking
your nose where it doesn't belong.

26:24.404 --> 26:25.658
Precisely.

26:25.706 --> 26:28.675
You know, I was sorry to hear
that you had been shot,

26:28.746 --> 26:31.145
but when I heard that you were
going to pull through, I...

26:31.222 --> 26:33.647
No need to visit. I respect that.

26:33.706 --> 26:35.987
Well, then, why don't you respect
that this is my autopsy?

26:36.044 --> 26:38.866
Because it's not. It's mine.

26:40.651 --> 26:43.265
Music. I like it.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.846
Shall we start?

26:48.230 --> 26:51.504
Minor contusions
on outside right kneecap

26:51.541 --> 26:53.653
consistent with a recent fall.

26:53.758 --> 26:57.238
Small amounts of expressed
liquid from both breasts.

26:58.399 --> 27:01.271
She has a three-month-old.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.321
I met her husband.

27:03.457 --> 27:05.217
Do you know what happened to her?

27:06.106 --> 27:08.585
Apparently, she threatened
a cafe customer and police

27:08.639 --> 27:10.665
with a cook's knife.

27:10.974 --> 27:12.492
Their Tasers didn't work.

27:12.529 --> 27:14.326
So, the police shot her?

27:16.445 --> 27:17.825
Right.

27:18.467 --> 27:19.988
OK, one puncture wound.

27:20.025 --> 27:22.639
No burning of the skin. Is her CT up?

27:26.482 --> 27:28.205
Well, there you have it.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.145
One bullet stopped by her T5.

27:31.211 --> 27:33.490
It appears to have passed...
Through her heart.

27:33.729 --> 27:36.248
We'll confirm with internals.

27:36.428 --> 27:39.146
While she's on her back,
let's draw blood and urine.

27:41.246 --> 27:43.465
- Can I help?
- No.

27:43.865 --> 27:47.025
No obvious haematoma or embolisms.

27:47.329 --> 27:49.313
I would like to know
what went on in there, though.

27:49.337 --> 27:51.145
- Don't start.
- What do you mean?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.748
I mean, since adolescence,

27:53.785 --> 27:56.276
she's been medicated
for severe anxiety.

27:56.313 --> 27:59.329
But no reported psychotic episodes,

27:59.554 --> 28:01.848
which sounds like
what happened outside the cafe.

28:02.023 --> 28:03.169
What was going on?

28:03.206 --> 28:06.501
We can't determine what was going on
inside someone's mind.

28:06.538 --> 28:07.736
Maybe not.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.238
We can determine
what caused that mind to die.

28:10.275 --> 28:12.118
- The bullet through her heart.
- Yes.

28:12.172 --> 28:14.243
- You're probably right.
- Well, what's the problem then?!

28:14.267 --> 28:17.626
The problem is we don't know
why she acted in such a way

28:17.663 --> 28:19.182
that she got herself shot.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.225
- Harrow...
- Gentlemen!

28:21.565 --> 28:23.778
My job is to complete this autopsy,

28:23.815 --> 28:26.255
and I can't do it
with this kind of distraction.

28:27.129 --> 28:29.569
Dr Harrow, would you mind leaving?

28:49.119 --> 28:50.799
Red bean mochi?

28:50.897 --> 28:53.087
What are you doing in Fairley's office?

28:53.238 --> 28:55.666
I just want to see if the police
have emailed Fairley.

28:55.722 --> 28:56.873
Why?

28:56.910 --> 28:58.585
Some officers wear body cameras

28:58.641 --> 29:01.000
and I thought there might be footage
of Sherry's shooting.

29:01.430 --> 29:03.910
But I can't crack his password.

29:13.716 --> 29:16.029
So, what do you think of
the new pathologist?

29:16.066 --> 29:18.025
I don't think of the new pathologist.

29:18.062 --> 29:20.026
Well, I think she's very smart.

29:20.108 --> 29:22.249
I think that if I were
that way inclined,

29:22.306 --> 29:24.234
I'd find her very interesting.

29:24.271 --> 29:28.621
I think that's all about as
hypothetical as your next pay rise.

29:28.748 --> 29:31.305
- Good Lord.
- What?

29:31.558 --> 29:33.403
"Harrow Eulogy, Draft 1"?

29:33.440 --> 29:36.040
- Yeah, no, don't read that...
- Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

29:36.945 --> 29:39.944
"Daniel Harrow was a pathologist."

29:40.342 --> 29:43.822
"He wore size medium scrubs."

29:44.975 --> 29:48.145
"He did not have a pet
that I was aware of."

29:48.620 --> 29:50.385
Why was Fairley going to do my eulogy?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.021
He asked.

29:52.462 --> 29:54.839
Anyway, it's irrelevant now.

29:56.302 --> 29:58.538
Any emails from the police?

29:58.798 --> 30:00.878
- No.
- Then, here.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.472
Someone posted this online.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.778
You can see when the Taser misfires.

30:06.984 --> 30:08.952
Drop the knife! Drop the knife!

30:09.039 --> 30:10.796
She took my drink! I need my drink!

30:10.833 --> 30:12.145
She took it!

30:12.292 --> 30:14.467
- She took it!
- Taser!

30:14.706 --> 30:17.269
Misfire!

30:17.419 --> 30:18.705
OK, drop the knife!

30:18.862 --> 30:20.145
Drop the knife!

30:20.201 --> 30:22.681
She took my drink!

30:26.426 --> 30:28.466
"She took my drink."

30:30.854 --> 30:32.385
This isn't your case.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.040
Then what's the harm?

30:34.852 --> 30:37.958
Residents of
a north Brisbane suburb are in shock

30:37.995 --> 30:39.780
after police shot a young mother

30:39.817 --> 30:42.358
outside a suburban cafe this morning.

30:55.298 --> 30:57.585
Mr Diallo, Daniel Harrow.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.743
I'd like to ask about your wife.

31:04.802 --> 31:06.800
Have you finished with Sherry?

31:06.904 --> 31:08.703
They'd be done by now.

31:08.855 --> 31:10.735
It's OK, chicken.

31:13.748 --> 31:16.124
Mr Diallo, what was going on
with Sherry?

31:16.161 --> 31:18.745
Do you have any idea
why she was at that cafe?

31:18.920 --> 31:21.469
I usually leave for work
at about six in the morning,

31:21.558 --> 31:23.958
and Shez would take Bell for a walk.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.696
And her anxiety?

31:26.743 --> 31:29.208
She'd had it since I met her.

31:29.245 --> 31:30.945
Yeah, it's OK, chicken.

31:31.308 --> 31:35.970
But it'd been, you know,
kept under control.

31:36.096 --> 31:37.946
Had been?

31:38.256 --> 31:39.909
Tell me about her meds.

31:39.996 --> 31:44.225
Well, she was on Sertraline
for years, and that worked great.

31:44.639 --> 31:47.639
When she was on it, we could
go out to the shops, to dinner.

31:48.346 --> 31:52.844
But after Bella was born,
the Sertraline stopped working.

31:53.084 --> 31:55.844
She just kept getting worse.

31:56.306 --> 31:58.545
And she just drank.

31:59.010 --> 32:00.187
Alcohol?

32:00.224 --> 32:01.865
No, no, water...

32:02.276 --> 32:04.739
soft drinks, sweet drinks.

32:04.906 --> 32:07.742
She kept needing
smoothies, juices, all the time.

32:07.779 --> 32:10.665
But only after Bell was born?

32:12.259 --> 32:13.585
Did the birth go OK?

32:13.645 --> 32:14.828
Yeah.

32:14.906 --> 32:17.385
I mean, it took the doctor four goes
to get the epidural in

32:17.448 --> 32:20.069
but after that, it went fine.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.479
And what'd Sherry's psychiatrist say?

32:23.588 --> 32:27.265
We couldn't afford a psych.
We just went to the local clinic.

32:27.611 --> 32:31.185
And the GP prescribed Quint...

32:31.364 --> 32:32.594
Quin...

32:32.666 --> 32:34.906
- Quetiapine?
- Yeah.

32:36.431 --> 32:38.953
I'm afraid there wasn't any
in her system.

32:43.303 --> 32:44.945
She stopped taking that too?

32:45.057 --> 32:48.417
I'm not sure that's what caused
Sherry's behaviour at the cafe.

32:50.139 --> 32:53.122
What am I gonna tell Bell
when's she older?

32:53.495 --> 32:56.406
That the police had to shoot Mummy
because she was crazy?

32:56.488 --> 32:58.408
It's OK, Bell.

33:17.127 --> 33:18.409
You had me followed.

33:18.477 --> 33:20.585
No, I told you we were
watching out for you.

33:20.871 --> 33:23.631
What the hell were you doing
at Sherry Diallo's house?

33:24.466 --> 33:26.149
Look, I saw the footage
of the shooting.

33:26.186 --> 33:29.924
Yeah, we've all seen the footage,
and it's a tragedy.

33:31.105 --> 33:33.504
And not just what happened
to that poor young woman

33:33.911 --> 33:35.225
but also for that young copper

33:35.314 --> 33:38.305
who had to do one of the hardest
things any of us have to do.

33:38.389 --> 33:40.340
I hope you're not starting
some kind of witch-hunt.

33:40.364 --> 33:41.665
No!

33:42.142 --> 33:46.828
Look, the victim looked like she had
some kind of psychotic episode

33:46.955 --> 33:51.309
but her lifelong diagnosis
was anxiety, not psychosis.

33:51.367 --> 33:53.727
- So, I...
- You do know you're not working?

33:54.426 --> 33:56.305
Yeah, I know.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.731
- I'm not allowed back until...
- Until you have a psych assessment.

34:05.407 --> 34:08.705
- I don't have anxiety or psychosis.
- Look, mate, I get it.

34:08.938 --> 34:10.513
Not wanting to have a psych assessment?

34:10.550 --> 34:12.047
I mean, guys like us,

34:12.085 --> 34:13.828
we don't want to admit
we're scared of dying.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.335
I'm not scared of dying!

34:15.420 --> 34:18.864
And guys like us get better
by getting back to the job.

34:19.628 --> 34:22.868
Hey, you need to pass
that psych assessment.

34:24.744 --> 34:26.943
So, here's what you say.

34:27.451 --> 34:29.291
Are you serious?

34:29.905 --> 34:33.146
When they ask you if memories of
your shooting are coming back...

34:33.306 --> 34:35.929
- They're not.
- You'll be tempted to lie.

34:35.966 --> 34:37.126
Don't.

34:37.886 --> 34:41.088
Say, "Yes, but they're
less and less frequent"

34:41.125 --> 34:43.443
"and, frankly, they're becoming
a bit boring."

34:46.453 --> 34:48.612
How have you been sleeping?

34:49.407 --> 34:51.106
No worse than before.

34:51.730 --> 34:52.985
Meaning?

34:53.103 --> 34:55.945
Meaning, I used to sleep
about four hours a night.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.225
I still sleep about four hours a night.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.984
How do you feel about
returning to work?

35:00.528 --> 35:01.785
Fine.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.425
Good. Excited.

35:03.570 --> 35:05.988
And about reconnecting
with your workmates?

35:06.082 --> 35:07.513
Great.

35:07.586 --> 35:08.865
Happy.

35:08.997 --> 35:10.298
Except Fairley.

35:10.386 --> 35:12.665
Sorry? Fairly... happy.

35:13.017 --> 35:14.825
I'm looking forward.

35:14.952 --> 35:16.385
Excellent.

35:16.586 --> 35:18.465
Well, that's just about it.

35:18.502 --> 35:19.549
Good.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.506
Have you been remembering
your shooting?

35:23.268 --> 35:26.425
Have thoughts of it
come into your mind uninvited?

35:26.783 --> 35:29.063
Images you just can't get rid of?

35:31.535 --> 35:32.995
Yes.

35:33.818 --> 35:36.289
But they're less and less frequent

35:36.326 --> 35:40.036
and... quite frankly,
they're becoming a bit boring.

35:52.226 --> 35:55.128
- Nichols?
- We found the bullet that shot you.

35:55.226 --> 35:57.345
Its trajectory dropped
pretty quick after...

35:57.509 --> 35:58.865
Well, you slowed it down.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.374
- .276.
- Rare calibre.

36:01.474 --> 36:03.515
Yeah, which means it's a rare gun.

36:03.665 --> 36:05.025
So, you found it?

36:05.300 --> 36:08.443
Found it, and the bloke who bought it.

36:08.675 --> 36:11.114
Harrow, this is a favour.

36:11.583 --> 36:15.623
You don't get to say anything
or do anything, OK?

36:16.696 --> 36:18.456
OK.

36:20.363 --> 36:22.522
So, Brendan, you arrived at the park.

36:23.043 --> 36:24.448
Then what happened?

36:24.527 --> 36:27.294
- You don't have to answer.
- Mate, it's alright.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.985
I parked me car and I checked
that there's no-one about.

36:32.396 --> 36:34.587
Then I got the gun I just bought
out of the boot.

36:34.624 --> 36:35.743
This Garand?

36:35.795 --> 36:38.356
- My client doesn't have to...
- Mate, I've told you, it's alright.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.461
- You remember this guy?
- You can continue, Brendan.

36:40.497 --> 36:42.652
Yeah. That one.

36:42.726 --> 36:44.448
Vaguely.

36:44.710 --> 36:47.106
Sss... Skyde?

36:47.144 --> 36:50.465
Skene. Brendan Skene.

36:51.117 --> 36:53.185
He poisoned someone?

36:53.558 --> 36:57.118
Yeah, slipped rat poison into his
annoying neighbour's porridge.

36:58.822 --> 37:01.677
The park was dark, right?

37:01.714 --> 37:04.809
So, I made my way down to the shore
and I found a spot.

37:04.846 --> 37:06.530
I had a clear view of his boat.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.969
I just waited until he was on deck

37:10.191 --> 37:11.439
and I shot him.

37:11.495 --> 37:12.823
Shot who?

37:12.860 --> 37:14.225
Daniel Harrow.

37:14.404 --> 37:16.025
Why did you shoot Dr Harrow?

37:16.594 --> 37:18.987
'Cause he proved it was me
who put the Ratsak

37:19.024 --> 37:20.664
in that idiot's breakfast.

37:21.626 --> 37:24.465
If it weren't for him,
I would have got away with it.

37:24.502 --> 37:26.784
Instead, I done 11 years.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.342
I done 11 years.

37:30.692 --> 37:32.852
I shot him, alright?!

37:33.664 --> 37:35.184
Can I get some water?

37:35.946 --> 37:38.775
Interview paused 226pm.

37:42.343 --> 37:46.298
You can, thank me
whenever you're ready.

37:48.573 --> 37:51.613
- Thank you.
- You can go home and relax now.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.675
It's over.

38:02.501 --> 38:04.061
I'm sorry.

38:09.367 --> 38:10.886
Dr Harrow?

38:11.141 --> 38:12.941
All done?

38:30.757 --> 38:32.357
So, did you peek?

38:33.136 --> 38:34.735
- No.
- Really?

38:34.948 --> 38:37.065
The Daniel Harrow I know
would have looked.

38:37.249 --> 38:40.058
The Daniel Harrow you know
got himself shot.

38:45.616 --> 38:49.695
What were you afraid that she'd
discover in that head of yours?

38:50.234 --> 38:53.174
That the person I am
might stop me doing the thing

38:53.229 --> 38:55.469
that makes me the person I am.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.389
- So, do you want to see?
- Yeah.

38:58.426 --> 39:00.145
Good. You can't.

39:00.328 --> 39:03.848
But you can clear up your desk
and you can resume work on Monday.

39:13.701 --> 39:15.564
Drop the knife! Drop the knife!

39:15.601 --> 39:16.881
She took my drink!

39:16.918 --> 39:17.971
I need my drink!

39:18.008 --> 39:19.341
I need it! I need it!

39:19.378 --> 39:20.901
Drop the knife right now! Taser!

39:21.120 --> 39:22.720
Taser!

39:28.339 --> 39:30.419
It's not in there anymore.

39:30.906 --> 39:34.027
Her brain.
It's with the rest of her organs.

39:35.438 --> 39:37.478
Neat sutures, by the way.

39:39.607 --> 39:41.847
What sort of doctor were you?

39:43.746 --> 39:46.271
You think I missed something
in her autopsy?

39:48.991 --> 39:50.470
I do.

39:50.733 --> 39:52.413
But I don't know what.

39:54.470 --> 39:57.469
Alright. Illuminate me.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.595
Sherry Diallo was drinking.

39:59.703 --> 40:01.267
There was no alcohol in her system.

40:01.330 --> 40:03.980
No, no, no, drinking water,
soft drinks, a lot.

40:04.066 --> 40:06.705
According to her husband,
she was thirsty all the time.

40:07.185 --> 40:10.090
Polydipsia. Unquenchable thirst.

40:10.249 --> 40:12.465
That explains
her low blood sodium levels.

40:12.862 --> 40:16.262
She attacked that woman outside
the cafe for taking her drink.

40:17.436 --> 40:18.777
Now according to her husband,

40:18.866 --> 40:22.585
this odd behaviour started
three months ago.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.094
When her new baby was born.

40:28.546 --> 40:30.305
I checked her fluids.

40:30.443 --> 40:32.105
She was off her anti-anxiety meds.

40:32.441 --> 40:33.865
You see, this is what gets me.

40:33.902 --> 40:36.786
If she was off her meds,
she should have been exhibiting

40:36.826 --> 40:39.985
signs of acute anxiety, not psychosis.

40:40.089 --> 40:42.469
- So, something changed.
- Could it have been a stroke?

40:43.090 --> 40:45.702
I mean, a clot in the hypothalamus
could cause behavioural issues.

40:45.773 --> 40:49.498
No. I checked her brain CT.
There was no cerebral embolus.

40:49.706 --> 40:52.463
Besides, she was young,
healthy, good cholesterol,

40:52.537 --> 40:54.296
no trauma in the arterial system

40:54.333 --> 40:56.904
that could have caused a clot
to form and go up to her brain.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.547
Besides, there was no clot.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.652
Unless there was a clot.

41:04.426 --> 41:06.615
- And it dissolved.
- Dissolved.

41:14.507 --> 41:16.626
Was it neurosurgery you left?

41:17.226 --> 41:20.009
Which makes it all the more
unforgiveable for missing this.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.905
The clot's gone, but there's
the degenerated tissue it caused.

41:24.539 --> 41:26.264
And in the hypothalamus.

41:26.301 --> 41:27.582
Emotions. Behaviour.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.905
Thirst.

41:29.351 --> 41:31.058
And this could be three months old.

41:31.095 --> 41:33.095
Which is when her baby was born.

41:34.349 --> 41:36.588
What are you thinking
caused the embolism?

41:36.625 --> 41:40.889
Well, Sherry's husband did say
she had trouble with her epidural.

41:41.557 --> 41:43.091
Doesn't make sense.

41:43.258 --> 41:45.090
A clot caused by a spinal catheter

41:45.127 --> 41:47.007
would have been trapped by the lungs.

41:48.461 --> 41:50.061
Or the heart.

41:53.168 --> 41:55.647
Here's the path of the bullet

41:55.684 --> 41:59.345
entering just below
the pulmonary trunk.

41:59.727 --> 42:02.256
Through the tricuspid valve,
exiting right atrium.

42:02.306 --> 42:05.265
A lot of damage from the bullet.

42:05.463 --> 42:08.910
Which explains why no-one saw this.

42:08.983 --> 42:11.183
A hole in her heart's septal tissue.

42:12.672 --> 42:14.831
That's what I missed.

42:15.213 --> 42:17.773
She probably had it her whole life.

42:19.096 --> 42:22.255
But it's how the clot got
from her spine to her brain.

42:22.519 --> 42:24.660
The bullet killed her,

42:24.697 --> 42:27.342
but that's what set
the dominoes falling.

42:28.457 --> 42:30.777
That's her real cause of death.

42:48.714 --> 42:50.434
A blood clot?

42:50.727 --> 42:52.585
Sherry wanted the epidural.

42:53.051 --> 42:56.065
She asked me if I thought
it was a good idea and I said,

42:56.519 --> 43:00.385
"Babe, anything that stops you
being in pain."

43:00.560 --> 43:02.625
It wasn't just the epidural.

43:03.162 --> 43:05.465
No-one knew that she had that
little hole in her heart.

43:05.607 --> 43:10.000
At least I can tell Bella
that her mum wasn't crazy.

43:14.406 --> 43:16.086
Thanks for seeing me.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.143
No problem.

43:20.621 --> 43:22.381
You want to shut the door?

43:27.169 --> 43:29.465
- Have a seat.
- I'm OK to stand.

43:29.789 --> 43:32.305
Alright. How can I help?

43:32.766 --> 43:35.900
I made mistakes
in my first autopsy here.

43:36.608 --> 43:38.647
Sherry Diallo?

43:38.971 --> 43:40.988
Well, I read your report,

43:41.025 --> 43:44.145
and to my mind,
you did a really thorough job.

43:44.670 --> 43:46.705
You not only determined cause of death,

43:46.742 --> 43:48.627
you determined why
that poor young woman

43:48.664 --> 43:50.425
was suffering her behavioural problems.

43:50.513 --> 43:54.203
But I only determined those
because of your Dr Harrow.

43:54.351 --> 43:56.791
OK. Now I insist you sit.

43:59.744 --> 44:03.423
You know, you can learn
a lot from your uncle.

44:04.028 --> 44:06.228
And as for Harrow, well...

44:08.278 --> 44:10.701
I don't approve of his
methods, I don't.

44:10.998 --> 44:13.472
But I do approve of his results.

44:13.861 --> 44:15.189
And he's going to be around,

44:15.226 --> 44:18.670
so it's up to you whether you
want to learn from him or not,

44:18.857 --> 44:21.639
- OK?
- Yes.

44:24.605 --> 44:25.971
Yeah.

44:35.950 --> 44:37.556
What's going on?

44:37.903 --> 44:41.130
I'm afraid your shooter's
not going back to jail.

44:41.852 --> 44:44.665
Brendan Skene, found dead in his cell.

44:44.809 --> 44:46.725
Apparently, he had
severe Type-2 diabetes

44:46.762 --> 44:49.248
and didn't tell the watch-house
he needed insulin.

44:49.784 --> 44:52.743
Diabetes? Why didn't he tell?

44:53.004 --> 44:54.162
Well, maybe he didn't want to do

44:54.186 --> 44:56.705
another 11 years for attempted murder.

44:57.306 --> 44:59.572
Cataracts. Grade two or three.

44:59.722 --> 45:01.207
You know, you should be grateful.

45:01.358 --> 45:04.583
If his eyesight was any better,
it might be you in this body bag.

45:05.600 --> 45:09.080
Anyway, saves us all a trial.

45:15.830 --> 45:17.270
Hey?

45:17.714 --> 45:19.085
Are you OK?

45:19.166 --> 45:20.645
Yeah. Fine.

45:20.791 --> 45:22.193
What's up with you?

45:22.326 --> 45:23.686
Fairley...

45:24.426 --> 45:26.505
Did you tell him
I was on his computer?

45:26.692 --> 45:31.555
Listen, you know how Fairley
likes to rehearse his speeches?

45:32.353 --> 45:34.592
If you tell him I gave you this,

45:34.895 --> 45:38.549
I will start singing along
to your records.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.473
That's... that's enough!

46:21.796 --> 46:23.516
And... rolling.

46:25.314 --> 46:28.531
Dr Daniel Harrow was...

46:29.749 --> 46:33.709
well, he was
an extraordinary pathologist.

46:34.426 --> 46:37.293
He was intuitive,

46:37.847 --> 46:41.381
dedicated and inventive,

46:41.682 --> 46:45.658
and committed to giving a voice
to those who had lost theirs.

46:47.128 --> 46:50.728
But... he was also my friend.

46:52.467 --> 46:54.387
And...

46:55.621 --> 46:56.789
And I...

46:58.573 --> 47:00.163
We'll just pick this up later,
shall we?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.999
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll fix it.
- Right.

47:09.821 --> 47:11.726
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:12.239 --> 47:14.678
Sorry it's taken a while
for me to call back.

47:14.774 --> 47:16.694
I've been working and stuff.

47:16.856 --> 47:19.505
- And you've got yourselves a flat.
- Yeah.

47:19.635 --> 47:21.665
When we're settled,
I'll invite you over.

47:22.193 --> 47:23.526
What about you?

47:23.629 --> 47:25.788
I heard the police got the guy
who shot you.

47:26.004 --> 47:27.444
They did.

47:28.406 --> 47:30.205
He died in custody.

47:30.668 --> 47:32.589
Well, that means
I don't have to kill him.

47:32.702 --> 47:34.505
No.

47:34.812 --> 47:36.313
Karma did the job.

47:36.672 --> 47:39.312
I didn't think you believed in
stuff like that.

47:41.173 --> 47:43.693
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

47:44.535 --> 47:45.975
What's wrong?

47:47.277 --> 47:49.437
Nothing. Nothing.

47:50.313 --> 47:52.792
- How's Callan?
- He's good.

47:53.312 --> 47:56.065
He's out, working and stuff.

47:56.621 --> 47:58.501
Busking, I guess.

48:00.387 --> 48:01.935
And are you OK?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.545
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

48:05.364 --> 48:06.656
And you?

48:06.693 --> 48:08.893
If you're fine, then so am I.

48:10.358 --> 48:11.582
OK.

48:11.619 --> 48:14.278
Well... goodnight.

48:14.516 --> 48:15.914
Goodnight.

48:56.709 --> 48:57.857
Hello?

48:57.946 --> 48:59.706
Did you like my flowers?

49:02.372 --> 49:03.674
Who is this?

49:03.826 --> 49:07.029
This is the man who left
those beautiful blood-red roses.

49:07.106 --> 49:08.884
You know, the 'Mister Lincoln's.

49:11.250 --> 49:12.448
Who is this?

49:12.506 --> 49:15.869
Dr Harrow, please,
where's the fun in that?

49:20.399 --> 49:23.145
You left me flowers
because you heard I was shot.

49:23.209 --> 49:26.769
No, I left you flowers
because I'm the one who shot you.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.880
Unfortunately, my friend, the man
who shot me has been arrested.

49:32.986 --> 49:36.185
Yes, yes, found, arrested

49:36.321 --> 49:39.030
and has perished in Her Majesty's care.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.654
There are a lot of people
who know I've been shot

49:44.691 --> 49:46.505
and who'd like me to feel
a bit anxious,

49:46.593 --> 49:48.426
but, frankly, I'm not in the mood.

49:48.494 --> 49:52.814
But you are in the mood for another
glass of Crianza Tempranillo.

49:57.266 --> 49:59.491
- Where are you?
- Don't worry.

49:59.528 --> 50:02.425
I'm not gonna shoot you again.
Not tonight.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.407
I'm glad I didn't kill you
with my first shot.

50:05.466 --> 50:08.499
Seeing you there, in your hospital bed,

50:08.610 --> 50:12.282
your bedside table covered
with missives of affection

50:12.385 --> 50:14.185
from those who care for you,

50:14.620 --> 50:18.625
because now I have the chance
to do more than kill you once.

50:18.731 --> 50:21.165
Now I will take away

50:21.202 --> 50:22.821
everything that you hold dear,

50:22.871 --> 50:24.316
everything you love,

50:24.353 --> 50:27.486
everything that makes
your life worth living.

50:30.057 --> 50:32.111
Hands! Hands behind your head!

50:32.306 --> 50:33.786
Drop the backpack. Step away from it.

50:33.846 --> 50:37.025
And once I've done that,
then I will kill you.

50:37.074 --> 50:38.562
And I promise you,

50:38.599 --> 50:41.629
when that happens,
you won't want to live.

50:42.093 --> 50:43.469
Before I ask you any questions,

50:43.506 --> 50:45.745
I must tell you,
you have the right to remain silent.

50:46.054 --> 50:47.672
So, get ready, Dr Harrow.

50:47.742 --> 50:51.474
And you remember,
everything you hold dear.

Next on Harrow...

51:05.933 --> 51:08.568
Your daughter broke the law
and she's going to have to pay.

51:08.695 --> 51:11.785
I think someone did this to you
to get to me.

51:11.858 --> 51:13.945
- Do you know who?
- I'm going to find out.

51:14.437 --> 51:16.093
Think about what you're suggesting.

51:16.130 --> 51:18.689
- That Skene was a patsy?
- I know. It sounds crazy.

51:18.826 --> 51:20.545
When did you sleep with Grace?

51:20.678 --> 51:23.225
We decided to keep things
strictly professional.

51:23.535 --> 51:25.665
Who goes BASE-jumping
and doesn't pull their chute?

51:25.757 --> 51:27.955
I don't know. But those guys were pros.

51:28.056 --> 51:29.577
Or maybe they were just unlucky.
