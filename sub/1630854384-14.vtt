00:00.834 --> 00:02.202
The prosecutor said that
she and Que

00:02.202 --> 00:03.803
were working together
to get me...

00:03.803 --> 00:05.271
-Locked up.
-[Calvin]<i> No.</i>

00:05.271 --> 00:07.273
Que's triflin' ass gave you up.

00:07.273 --> 00:08.742
Sabrina had nothin' to do
with this.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.176
[Narrator]<i> Previously on Sistas.</i>

00:10.176 --> 00:12.112
Do you think they're gonna
let him out?

00:12.112 --> 00:13.980
So they can come get me?

00:13.980 --> 00:15.281
That's what they said.

00:15.281 --> 00:18.451
I was wondering if me and you
and Fatima...

00:18.885 --> 00:20.220
<i>Meet here, at the house.</i>

00:20.220 --> 00:22.021
I wanna know why they
invited you here.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.890
Wait, Andi, did you tell her?

00:23.890 --> 00:25.425
Of course I didn't, I swear!

00:25.425 --> 00:27.627
So are you guys ready to talk?

00:27.627 --> 00:28.628
[music]

00:31.734 --> 00:33.436
Can I get you guys anything
to drink?

00:33.436 --> 00:35.004
-No.
-Yeah...

00:35.405 --> 00:37.473
I just wanna know what
this is about.

00:41.444 --> 00:42.945
I just wanna talk to you.

00:45.682 --> 00:46.783
About?

00:47.316 --> 00:49.719
The, the baby.
Of course.

00:50.453 --> 00:52.321
Oh.
Okay.

00:52.321 --> 00:54.457
Well...
Go on.

00:56.592 --> 00:59.028
Fatima and I talked, and...

01:00.096 --> 01:01.531
If the baby is mine,

01:01.531 --> 01:04.033
then I plan on
being there fully.

01:05.234 --> 01:06.469
Oh.

01:07.036 --> 01:08.471
Okay, you...

01:08.905 --> 01:10.907
Talked to Fatima
and then decided...

01:11.240 --> 01:12.942
That, that's good to know.

01:13.509 --> 01:14.744
Yeah, and...

01:15.011 --> 01:16.012
I feel like...

01:17.280 --> 01:19.782
It will be responsible for us
to try to figure out

01:19.782 --> 01:21.317
some sort of child support...

01:21.317 --> 01:23.086
Arrangement.

01:24.020 --> 01:25.021
Child support?

01:25.021 --> 01:26.255
[Zac] Yeah.

01:26.255 --> 01:28.124
[music]

01:28.124 --> 01:29.492
Okay.

01:30.727 --> 01:33.162
Well, why do you wanna talk
about this all of a sudden?

01:33.896 --> 01:35.998
I just...
I wanna do the right thing.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.901
Well, I appreciate that, but...

01:39.502 --> 01:40.803
Like you said, I mean,

01:40.803 --> 01:42.705
you don't even know if
the child is yours.

01:43.005 --> 01:44.273
We, we don't, but...

01:44.841 --> 01:47.410
It may be, so I think
it's just responsible

01:47.410 --> 01:48.878
that we start the discussion,
you know?

01:49.946 --> 01:51.447
I see.

01:51.447 --> 01:52.715
Okay.

01:53.349 --> 01:55.284
I thought about it,
and I feel like...

01:55.651 --> 01:57.787
-It's fair...
-[Karen] Oh, yes, yes.

01:57.787 --> 01:59.989
Tell me what you think is fair.

02:01.057 --> 02:02.558
Right...

02:03.359 --> 02:05.561
I just think it's fair,
it would be fair,

02:05.561 --> 02:08.498
if I contribute
three thousand a month.

02:08.498 --> 02:10.466
To cover all the expenses.

02:10.967 --> 02:11.934
Three?

02:12.335 --> 02:13.503
[Zac] Yes.

02:15.171 --> 02:16.506
I see.

02:17.940 --> 02:19.809
You see?
What...

02:20.209 --> 02:21.544
What do you see?

02:21.544 --> 02:23.513
You keep sayin' you see.
What, what do you see?

02:24.347 --> 02:25.815
I see...

02:27.116 --> 02:28.918
This nice ass house.

02:32.255 --> 02:34.023
I see a nice ass car.

02:34.023 --> 02:37.059
Actually, two nice ass cars
outside.

02:37.059 --> 02:39.428
-[Zac] Karen...
-No, just let me finish.

02:39.428 --> 02:42.865
[music]

02:42.865 --> 02:45.168
I see you more concerned
with your money.

02:45.635 --> 02:47.737
Than what may be your child.

02:48.171 --> 02:49.639
[Zac] Karen, that's not fair.

02:50.139 --> 02:51.240
It's not?

02:51.240 --> 02:52.842
No.
That, that's not what it is.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.577
[Karen] You don't have to play
with me, though, Zac.

02:54.577 --> 02:56.012
I'm not playin' with you.

02:56.746 --> 02:58.581
-Okay.
-[Zac] I'm not, I just...

02:59.048 --> 03:01.150
That's why I feel like it's
important for us

03:01.150 --> 03:02.552
to talk about this now,

03:02.552 --> 03:04.954
before we even know if
the baby's mine.

03:04.954 --> 03:10.893
[music]

03:12.528 --> 03:13.930

03:37.712 --> 03:39.447
Wait, how, how do you know that?

03:40.315 --> 03:42.150
I actually did what you
suggested.

03:42.784 --> 03:44.452
I went back to the doctor,

03:44.452 --> 03:46.021
and inquired about
the ultrasound.

03:46.588 --> 03:49.124
Oh, what I suggested
to your mom.

03:49.124 --> 03:50.392
[Karen] Mm-hm.

03:50.392 --> 03:52.460
She told me, I went in,
and you know.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.429
The dates matched, so...

03:54.429 --> 03:55.764
Thanks for the tip.

03:56.064 --> 03:57.232
Yeah, but...

03:58.633 --> 04:00.168
It was really close.

04:01.503 --> 04:03.939
Seven days apart, to be exact.

04:05.173 --> 04:08.710
Okay, well that's still not
100%, Karen.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.111
It's pretty damn close.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.249
Okay...
Don't get combative.

04:14.249 --> 04:15.483
I'm not gettin' combative.

04:20.455 --> 04:21.623
Yeah.

04:23.225 --> 04:24.526
Karen, what is this?

04:25.093 --> 04:26.027
[Karen] What is what?

04:26.027 --> 04:27.195
[throat clearing]

04:27.195 --> 04:28.697

back and forth.

04:30.632 --> 04:31.833
I don't have a problem with you.

04:31.833 --> 04:33.702
If I did, I wouldn't be here.
Trust me.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.705
-Okay, you guys, let's just...
-[Karen] No, no.

04:38.773 --> 04:40.642
If I wasn't cool...

04:40.909 --> 04:42.544
I wouldn't be sittin'
right here.

04:42.544 --> 04:44.079
I wouldn't be talkin'
about that desk.

04:44.079 --> 04:44.846
You know?

04:45.146 --> 04:47.282
The same desk that
you built for me?

04:47.282 --> 04:48.884
The same color, actually.

04:48.884 --> 04:50.719
You said that it was for me.

04:50.719 --> 04:53.355
To study my license.
Fatima, what are you studying?

04:54.089 --> 04:56.391
Karen, we are here to talk
about the baby.

04:56.391 --> 04:57.492
[Karen] You right.

04:57.492 --> 04:58.894
Absolutely right.

04:59.361 --> 05:00.595
So...

05:01.463 --> 05:02.631
Zac...

05:04.566 --> 05:06.935
I ain't gon' sue you over
child support,

05:06.935 --> 05:08.737
if that's what you afraid of.

05:09.571 --> 05:11.306
I ain't gon' ask you
for nothin'.

05:11.907 --> 05:14.276
'Cause I don't need you to
raise this child.

05:14.276 --> 05:17.646
I have my own money.
I always have, you know?

05:18.713 --> 05:20.882
And I have Aaron.

though he knows

05:23.652 --> 05:25.086
this ain't his baby.

05:26.621 --> 05:27.956

05:27.956 --> 05:29.391
-Bein' there fully, Karen.
-[Karen] Oh, good!

05:29.391 --> 05:31.593
Then the child will have
two fathers.

05:33.094 --> 05:34.396
Is that all?

05:40.402 --> 05:41.403
That's all I got.

05:41.670 --> 05:42.737
[Karen] Okay, let's go.

05:42.737 --> 05:44.706
-Yes.
-[Karen] Come on.

05:47.909 --> 05:49.644
It's a really nice house, Zac.

05:49.644 --> 05:50.879
Thank you.

05:51.313 --> 05:52.681
And Fatima...

05:53.281 --> 05:54.249
[Fatima] Yes?

05:54.716 --> 05:57.686
I really do wish you well
in this struggle.

05:58.553 --> 06:01.589
Karen...
It's not a struggle, honey.

06:01.589 --> 06:03.058
Well, thank you.

06:04.626 --> 06:06.861
You ain't been at it that long,
so...

06:06.861 --> 06:09.631
[Andi] Karen.
Karen...

06:09.631 --> 06:11.032
-You know what, Karen?
-Mm-mm, mm-mm.

06:11.299 --> 06:12.367
-[Fatima] No.
-Yes?

06:12.834 --> 06:14.102
[Fatima] See...

06:14.102 --> 06:15.870
I don't think you wish me well
at all.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.138
Because if you did,

06:17.138 --> 06:19.074
you wouldn't keep
throwin' shade.

06:19.541 --> 06:21.142
-You right.
-You know, we should go.

06:21.142 --> 06:22.510
No, no, no.

06:22.510 --> 06:24.612
-No, no, let her talk.
-[Karen] Yeah.

06:24.612 --> 06:26.614
-[Karen] We both grown.
-Exactly.

06:26.982 --> 06:30.452
So yes, I do throw shade.

06:30.719 --> 06:32.754
Even when I don't want to.

06:32.754 --> 06:36.191
Because I see you and I see him,
and you seem happy.

06:36.191 --> 06:37.692
And that's -- up.

06:37.692 --> 06:39.260
Again, shade.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.062
[Karen] Oh my God.

06:41.062 --> 06:44.099
Yeah, that's the human in me.
I ain't perfect.

06:44.399 --> 06:45.734
But you know what?

06:47.402 --> 06:49.037
I want you to be happy.

06:49.904 --> 06:51.573
'Cause shit, who don't
wanna be happy?

06:52.340 --> 06:54.609
I wanna be happy,
I want him to be happy.

06:54.609 --> 06:56.211
So that when
this child gets here,

06:56.211 --> 06:57.379
we can all be happy.

06:58.546 --> 06:59.848
Now with that, I agree.

06:59.848 --> 07:01.082
[Karen] Okay.

07:01.082 --> 07:03.885
But this house pisses me off.

07:04.819 --> 07:08.256
That desk...
Pisses me off!

07:08.590 --> 07:10.658
All these pictures of y'all...

07:15.497 --> 07:17.132
[Andi] Karen, we should go.

07:28.843 --> 07:31.079
This is an engagement ring?

07:31.079 --> 07:32.514
-[Andi] Okay, let's go.
-No.

07:32.514 --> 07:34.416
-[Andi] Okay.
-Yes.

07:34.416 --> 07:36.217
It is.

07:37.385 --> 07:39.020
So y'all engaged?

07:41.356 --> 07:43.258
Yes.
We are.

07:51.232 --> 07:52.267
Shit.

07:53.768 --> 07:55.236
You want me...

07:56.004 --> 07:57.472
To sign an agreement...

07:59.007 --> 08:01.509
So that the child that you
helped me make

08:02.177 --> 08:04.079
doesn't interfere
with your life?

08:04.679 --> 08:06.014
Karen, that's not fair.

08:06.014 --> 08:07.682
-That's, that's not.
-[Karen] Oh, it's not?

08:07.682 --> 08:09.117
-No, it's not.
-Oh no?

08:09.117 --> 08:10.952
'Cause you don't have
to play games with me.

08:11.386 --> 08:13.121
-[Zac] Ain't nobody playin'...
-We can just be straight up.

08:15.090 --> 08:16.958
I am being straight up.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.793
Tell me what you want.

08:20.328 --> 08:21.429
What do you want?

08:21.729 --> 08:23.331
I just told you.

08:26.668 --> 08:28.002
Okay.

08:31.473 --> 08:33.508
Let's make this easy for you.

08:34.676 --> 08:36.344
You come up with an agreement...

08:37.579 --> 08:39.114
Andi, you look it over.

08:39.114 --> 08:41.449
And I'll sign it.
Okay?

08:43.184 --> 08:44.052
Okay?

08:44.052 --> 08:45.753
-[Zac] Thank you.
-Okay.

08:45.753 --> 08:47.122

08:53.761 --> 08:55.063
Look, I...

08:55.630 --> 08:57.065
I did the desk for her.

08:57.599 --> 08:58.833
And I did it for you.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.401
But it's not the same thing.

09:01.469 --> 09:02.871
-Zac...
-[Zac] No, look.

09:02.871 --> 09:04.139
Just look, look.

09:04.139 --> 09:06.407

09:06.407 --> 09:09.911
If you don't wanna marry me
anymore, I understand.

09:10.912 --> 09:13.348
This is just a bunch of shit.

09:14.315 --> 09:15.283
Okay?

09:16.050 --> 09:19.387
And you can just go find any man
that'll have less drama

09:19.387 --> 09:20.522
than I have right now.

09:20.989 --> 09:23.858
Zac, what is this?
This is new.

09:23.858 --> 09:25.293
[Zac] What's what?

09:25.293 --> 09:27.362
-This insecure shit!
-[Zac] It's not insecurity.

09:28.863 --> 09:30.064
It's truth.

09:31.132 --> 09:33.501
Look at you, I can see the pain
in your face.

09:33.501 --> 09:34.802
I watched you watch her.

09:35.136 --> 09:37.305
Fatima, this is not about me.

09:37.305 --> 09:38.439
This is about you.

09:38.806 --> 09:40.542
And the way I feel about you.

09:42.610 --> 09:43.411
But a man...

09:46.181 --> 09:50.351
When a real man hurts the woman
he loves, he tries to fix it.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.421
I can't fix this.

09:55.723 --> 09:57.458
I can't.
And...

09:58.760 --> 10:01.696
I love you enough to know that
you deserve better than this.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.265
Shit, you deserve
better than me.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.701
[Fatima] Zac...

10:06.701 --> 10:08.469
Hey, nobody's perfect.

10:09.704 --> 10:11.406
All right?
I do deserve you.

10:11.406 --> 10:12.507
I deserve all of you.

10:15.410 --> 10:16.544
Now look, I know...

10:17.512 --> 10:19.013
What I'm gon' put up with...

10:20.548 --> 10:21.616
And what I'm not.

10:24.285 --> 10:26.354
And I know when
I've hit my limit.

10:32.293 --> 10:34.529
Well, can you at least tell me
you're gettin' close?

10:35.597 --> 10:36.864
Yes, Zac.

10:37.899 --> 10:39.334
I'm not even close.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.635
Okay.

10:43.171 --> 10:45.139
I'm just bein' careful.

10:46.574 --> 10:47.575
Look, Zac.

10:48.309 --> 10:51.212
There's choices you made...
I know you mean well.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.515
But those choices are
still affecting me.

10:54.849 --> 10:56.784
[Zac] Okay.

10:56.784 --> 10:59.220
All right.
So I gotta be careful.

11:01.556 --> 11:02.924
I got you.

11:08.596 --> 11:10.498
If you know all the shit

11:10.498 --> 11:13.034
that I've been through
with my exes...

11:13.301 --> 11:15.803
[music]

11:15.803 --> 11:17.205
You know I just...

11:17.972 --> 11:20.174
I learn just to watch and
listen.

11:22.443 --> 11:23.278
I know.

11:23.278 --> 11:24.746
-[Fatima] Okay?
-Yeah.

11:24.746 --> 11:26.047
[Fatima] So...

11:26.614 --> 11:29.350
I'm not concerned about what
you did before me.

11:34.088 --> 11:36.891
The only thing I'm
lookin' at right now...

11:36.891 --> 11:38.526
Is how you treat me.

11:39.294 --> 11:40.395
You okay?

11:40.695 --> 11:42.130
No.

11:44.899 --> 11:46.534
But I will be.

11:46.534 --> 11:52.473

[Calvin]<i> How are you?</i>

12:14.821 --> 12:16.056
Oh, I'm fine.

12:16.056 --> 12:18.124

12:21.494 --> 12:22.696
Okay, I'm sorry.

12:22.696 --> 12:24.197
You talk to Sabrina?

12:24.664 --> 12:25.699
[Calvin]<i> Yeah.</i>

12:26.599 --> 12:27.801
And what did she say?

12:28.568 --> 12:30.537
[Calvin]<i> She said she was gonna
talk to Andi.</i>

12:31.037 --> 12:32.672
What the hell is she gonna do?

12:32.939 --> 12:34.641
She's out on bail.

12:34.641 --> 12:36.009
I told you that.

12:36.009 --> 12:37.944
[Maurice]<i> Okay, well,
I need a lawyer.</i>

12:37.944 --> 12:40.613
Well, she said she was gonna
talk to Andi.

12:40.613 --> 12:42.649
I need my own lawyer.

12:43.516 --> 12:44.584
And a man.

12:45.452 --> 12:48.054
[Calvin]<i> No, you need someone
who's gonna really help you.</i>

12:48.755 --> 12:49.756
True.

12:50.123 --> 12:52.058
Okay, give me Andi's number.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.694
-I don't have it.

12:59.399 --> 13:00.967
Okay, let me text Sabrina.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.736
Oh, Sabrina.

13:03.236 --> 13:05.939
Just walking around in
the land of the free,

13:05.939 --> 13:07.273
Sa-free-na.

13:07.574 --> 13:08.742
Don't do that.

13:08.742 --> 13:10.276
[Maurice]<i> Don't do what?</i>

13:10.276 --> 13:12.979
You know good and well Sabrina
had nothin' to do with this.

13:12.979 --> 13:14.347
Neither did I!

13:15.115 --> 13:16.349
[Calvin]<i> I know that.</i>

13:17.450 --> 13:18.485
No, you don't.

13:18.952 --> 13:20.453
You blame me.

13:21.087 --> 13:22.288
Maurice...

13:22.288 --> 13:23.289
[Maurice]<i> You do.</i>

13:23.723 --> 13:25.258

at the house.</i>

13:25.258 --> 13:26.860
I don't blame you.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.661
You blame me, all y'all do.

[Calvin]<i> You didn't know he was
gonna do this shit.</i>

[Calvin]<i> But you did know
who he was.</i>

13:35.969 --> 13:37.437
What, why, what'd you say?

[Calvin]<i> Huh?
Nothin', nothin'.</i>

[Calvin]<i> How am I gon' do that?</i>

13:53.653 --> 13:56.523
I don't know, hoe,

Or Morse code?

13:58.491 --> 13:59.993
[Calvin]<i> Okay, I'll get it.</i>

14:14.374 --> 14:16.810
Whatever, bitch!
You don't love me.

14:16.810 --> 14:18.178
You wouldn't even give me none.

14:18.178 --> 14:19.612
Maurice, will you stop it?

14:19.612 --> 14:21.181
[Maurice]<i> No! I'm about to
hang up this phone.</i>

14:21.181 --> 14:24.017

a client.</i>

14:49.142 --> 14:50.477
Okay.

14:50.477 --> 14:53.313
Do you need me to come in
and turn everything off?

14:53.613 --> 14:55.181
Girl, I got this.

14:55.181 --> 14:56.349

14:59.385 --> 15:01.788
'Cause you obviously don't
trust me.

Don't try and guilt trip me.

15:04.824 --> 15:07.894

guilt trip you, but you are...</i>

Didn't you just leave the iron
on the other night?

15:15.468 --> 15:16.870
[Pam]<i> That was a mistake!</i>

15:16.870 --> 15:18.471
That could burn down my place.

15:18.471 --> 15:20.440
[Pam]<i> I know I could've burned
down your place.</i>

15:20.440 --> 15:22.008
Okay, then I'm stoppin' by.

15:22.775 --> 15:25.578
I'll send you a video of me
cutting everything off.

15:25.578 --> 15:27.080
Would that make you feel better?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.081
[Karen]<i> Yes.</i>

15:28.081 --> 15:29.649
Okay.

15:29.649 --> 15:31.251
[Karen]<i> And a video of you
turning the alarm on.</i>

15:31.251 --> 15:32.752
Am I missin' somethin'?

15:33.286 --> 15:34.654
What are you talkin' about?

15:34.654 --> 15:37.290
Is it 'cause you pregnant,
you actin' like this?

15:37.290 --> 15:38.391
[Karen]<i> What?</i>

15:38.391 --> 15:40.560
You've been all
on a girl lately.

15:41.294 --> 15:42.362
Okay, Pam.

15:42.362 --> 15:43.963
This is my place of business.

15:44.464 --> 15:46.633
If somethin' happens to it,
you gon' rebuild it?

15:46.633 --> 15:48.768
[Pam]<i> Hell no!
You got insurance.</i>

15:48.768 --> 15:50.069
Okay, you see?

15:50.069 --> 15:52.071
This is why I'm stoppin' by,
'cause I can't trust you.

15:52.071 --> 15:55.208
Girl, nothing is going to
happen.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.409

see the girls,

16:30.410 --> 16:32.245

I wanted to stop by and say...

17:00.940 --> 17:02.242
Thank you.

17:04.077 --> 17:05.245
What'd I do?

17:06.312 --> 17:07.547
You're consistent.

17:09.148 --> 17:11.351
-Consistent?
-[Karen] Yeah.

17:12.252 --> 17:13.886
And it means a lot.

It's all fine.

17:56.062 --> 17:57.030
It is.

18:16.849 --> 18:17.884
Yes, I am.

18:17.884 --> 18:19.585
-[Aaron] All right.
-Yes, I am, okay?

19:06.341 --> 19:07.809
[Gary] What are you...?

19:07.809 --> 19:09.945
Gary, you're gonna need
a lot more than some lemons.

19:10.412 --> 19:11.847
To cover that up.

19:11.847 --> 19:13.515
You just go ahead and make
yourself comfortable.

Comfortable.

Oh, I don't think I want
anything,

if that's how you
treat your fruits.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.191
Yeah, it's fruit abuse.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.093
Fruit abuse.

[Danni] That is not all I need.

19:52.254 --> 19:53.388
What?

19:53.388 --> 19:54.690
Gary.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.692
[Sabrina] What?

19:57.326 --> 19:58.293
Here.

19:58.293 --> 19:59.428
Naked.

20:00.295 --> 20:01.430
Just now.

20:01.997 --> 20:03.031
Very naked.

20:03.565 --> 20:04.800
He's here?

20:05.334 --> 20:06.435
Naked.

20:07.002 --> 20:08.770
[Sabrina] Are they back
together?

20:08.770 --> 20:09.871
Guess so.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.040
She's holding out on us.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.276
[Danni] Always.
Always, always, always.

20:14.276 --> 20:15.477
Is she here?

20:15.477 --> 20:16.712
No.

20:16.712 --> 20:17.913
I told you, I came off
the elevator

20:17.913 --> 20:19.147
he's talkin' about someone
waitin' for,

20:19.147 --> 20:20.148
he wasn't waitin' for me.

20:20.882 --> 20:22.784
You don't think we should go?

20:23.085 --> 20:24.486
I ain't goin' nowhere.

20:26.455 --> 20:27.456
Okay.

20:27.923 --> 20:29.791
I need to talk to her about
Maurice, anyway.

20:29.791 --> 20:32.194
I texted her, she and Karen are
on their way.

20:32.961 --> 20:33.895
Okay.

20:36.832 --> 20:39.001
Anyway, in the meantime...

20:39.334 --> 20:41.536
We can talk to Gary Daddy.

20:42.604 --> 20:44.373
I don't like him being here.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.640
I know.

20:46.008 --> 20:47.142
Do you?

20:47.142 --> 20:50.278
You know, I'm really thinkin'
Daddy Gary.

20:50.679 --> 20:52.047
Daddy Gary?

20:52.047 --> 20:53.248
Oh, yeah.

20:53.248 --> 20:55.917
Gary with the long dong silver.

20:55.917 --> 20:58.286
-Danni!
-No, you ain't seen him.

20:58.653 --> 21:00.922
I've seen him, I know why
she want him back.

21:01.223 --> 21:02.791
Coulda been a porn star.

21:02.791 --> 21:04.326
Ew!
Can you...?

21:04.326 --> 21:06.862
Oh, yeah.
And he got money!

21:06.862 --> 21:08.597
Uh-huh, and he's crazy!

21:08.597 --> 21:10.399
He's got the D and the M.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.969
You know, that aside, right?
Craziness aside.

21:13.969 --> 21:16.171
Did you just forget him
squeezing her?

21:16.705 --> 21:19.341
And now look at the penthouse
and the car in her name.

21:19.341 --> 21:22.044
-You know, it all works out.
-Stop getting distracted!

21:22.711 --> 21:24.413
Girl, I know.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.748
If she sued him, she would have
got the same damn thing,

21:26.748 --> 21:28.550
and would've never done
this shit again.

21:28.550 --> 21:29.918
That you know of.

21:29.918 --> 21:31.720
That she would have told us of.

21:34.222 --> 21:36.291
[sighing]

21:36.291 --> 21:37.225
Sabrina.

21:37.893 --> 21:38.994
Gary.

21:43.632 --> 21:45.333
Look, I overheard y'all.

21:46.034 --> 21:48.970
And just so you know,
I never did it again.

21:48.970 --> 21:52.207
Ear hustlin',
and you put some clothes on.

21:54.476 --> 21:55.577
Again, Danni.

21:55.977 --> 21:58.847
Look, I'm just gonna go and
let y'all talk.

21:58.847 --> 22:00.849
-Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
-Yeah, he can go.

22:00.849 --> 22:02.517
-No, we need to talk to you.
-Bye.

22:02.517 --> 22:03.718
No, no, no.

22:03.718 --> 22:05.454
-I need to talk to you.
-[Sabrina] Danni!

22:05.454 --> 22:07.389
Are you and Andi back together?

22:07.923 --> 22:10.725
[Gary] No, we're just...

22:11.893 --> 22:13.628
Like...

22:17.599 --> 22:18.867
We're seeing each other.

22:18.867 --> 22:22.070
Seeing each other, okay.
I see.

22:23.371 --> 22:26.875
So you're okay with her
seeing other people, too?

22:27.442 --> 22:28.977
No, I don't mind at all.

22:29.578 --> 22:31.179
Are you still stalking her?

22:31.947 --> 22:32.948
What?

22:33.448 --> 22:34.749
[Sabrina] You heard me.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.318
Okay...

22:36.585 --> 22:38.386
That wasn't what it was.

22:38.386 --> 22:39.554
All right?
It was a bit...

22:39.554 --> 22:42.057
It was a bit crazy...
I will admit.

22:42.057 --> 22:43.225
We were there.

22:44.359 --> 22:46.194
I'm just gonna go.
All right?

22:46.194 --> 22:47.729
-[Sabrina] Mm-hm.
-[Danni] No, no, no, no.

22:47.729 --> 22:49.164
-[Sabrina] Bye.
-I'm not done.

22:49.164 --> 22:50.465
[Gary] Okay, look...

22:50.465 --> 22:53.135
I've never loved anyone like
I've loved your friend.

22:53.135 --> 22:54.202
Okay?

22:54.202 --> 22:55.170
So I'm just...

22:55.170 --> 22:56.838
I'm just trying to
make this right.

22:57.539 --> 22:58.673
Are you?

22:58.673 --> 23:00.142
Yes.
I am.

23:00.142 --> 23:01.543
Wait...

23:01.543 --> 23:03.612
Why do you think I bought her
this apartment and the car?

23:03.612 --> 23:05.881
So romantic, fixes everything.

23:05.881 --> 23:07.883
These are material things, Gary.

23:07.883 --> 23:09.317
[Gary] I know that.

23:09.317 --> 23:10.552
I thought I just...

23:10.552 --> 23:12.654
I don't know how else
to say I'm sorry.

23:12.988 --> 23:14.422
Hm...

23:14.422 --> 23:17.058
I don't know, maybe you could
try by doing the right thing?

23:17.058 --> 23:19.094
I am, I mean, you can ask her.
She'll tell you.

23:19.094 --> 23:21.229
No, we don't want to ask her.

23:22.097 --> 23:24.833
Why don't you tell us?
What is the right thing, Gary?

23:25.433 --> 23:26.868
Okay.

23:28.069 --> 23:28.904
I'm not jealous.

23:29.437 --> 23:32.073
Oh, that's good!
That just went away like that?

23:32.874 --> 23:35.210
Yeah, look, I, I know how
your friend feels about me.

23:35.844 --> 23:37.312
How does she feel about you?

23:38.180 --> 23:39.414
She loves me.

23:40.515 --> 23:42.117
Glad you know that.

23:42.450 --> 23:44.186
And I love her.

23:44.186 --> 23:45.954
I, I really do.

23:45.954 --> 23:48.290
That's good.
That's, that's real good.

23:49.024 --> 23:50.091
So...

23:50.825 --> 23:51.993
-I'm going to go...
-Mm-hm.

23:51.993 --> 23:53.328
[Gary] And leave you
to talk, okay?

23:53.328 --> 23:54.829
Mm-hm, bye.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.832
Danni, I'm sorry.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.001
Just sorry.

24:00.001 --> 24:01.770
You know, don't even apologize.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.638
I've seen it twice
at this point, you know?

24:03.638 --> 24:05.040
Same time next week?

24:05.040 --> 24:06.408
Bye!

24:06.408 --> 24:08.577
-I'm sorry about all that, too.
-[Danni] Mm-hm, mm-hm.

24:09.044 --> 24:11.079
[Gary] Good seeing you again,
Sabrina.

24:12.214 --> 24:13.348
Bye, Danni.

24:14.115 --> 24:15.550
Bye, Daddy.

24:15.550 --> 24:21.690
[music]

24:22.557 --> 24:27.095
[elevator shifting]

24:32.867 --> 24:35.270
-I don't like him bein' here.
-I know.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.404
Do you?

24:37.872 --> 24:40.442
Speakin' of don't like,
panty man.

24:40.442 --> 24:41.843
Please, Danni.

24:41.843 --> 24:43.511
No, no, no, no.
This is good.

24:44.346 --> 24:46.047
-[Sabrina] Not right now.
-No, listen.

24:46.448 --> 24:49.117
Him, I actually have to rethink.

24:49.117 --> 24:50.619
He was really ridin' for you.

24:50.619 --> 24:53.255
[music]

24:53.255 --> 24:54.389
Yeah.

24:55.423 --> 24:56.491
He was.

24:57.092 --> 24:58.994
Well, I mean, he was at
the house today

24:58.994 --> 25:00.262
when Bayo came by.

25:00.929 --> 25:04.366
There you go.
What happened?

25:05.033 --> 25:06.167
[Sabrina] Nothing.

25:07.569 --> 25:10.305
Bayo just hadn't heard from me,
so he came to check on me.

25:10.505 --> 25:12.240
And Calvin was there.

25:12.974 --> 25:14.442
Calvin was cool, though.

25:15.343 --> 25:16.878
Yeah, he had to be.

25:16.878 --> 25:18.780
He want that work again.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.482
Stop that, Danni.

25:23.385 --> 25:25.387
I've seen Calvin enraged.

25:25.387 --> 25:27.122
[Danni] Oh?
How so?

25:30.091 --> 25:32.927
Well, the guy that started all
this with Maurice?

25:34.729 --> 25:36.898
He asked him to leave.

25:37.465 --> 25:38.533
He refused.

25:39.234 --> 25:42.971
So Calvin took a golf club
and started beating him.

25:44.239 --> 25:46.341
You're -- lyin'!

25:47.075 --> 25:49.911
Yeah, I had to stop it.
He almost killed him.

25:50.211 --> 25:52.080
Well shit, why'd you stop him?

25:52.080 --> 25:54.115
'Cause I didn't want him
to go to jail.

25:54.115 --> 25:55.684
Well, you're better than me.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.153
I would've let Calvin kill
him and help him bury the body.

25:58.153 --> 26:01.389
[music]

26:06.854 --> 26:08.255
'Kay.

26:08.589 --> 26:09.824
-Hey!
-Hey.

26:09.824 --> 26:11.759
Hey, Danni, hey, Sabrina!
How are you?

26:11.759 --> 26:13.027
-[Danni] Good.
-Okay.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.063
Yes?

26:16.063 --> 26:17.531
Are you okay?
Where's Karen?

26:17.531 --> 26:19.867
-She's not too far behind.
-Okay, well, I need to talk

26:19.867 --> 26:21.302
-to you about Maurice.
-I need to talk to you

26:21.302 --> 26:23.204
-about something, first.
-[Danni] What?

26:23.204 --> 26:26.707
Zac invited Karen over to
his house.

26:26.707 --> 26:27.975
Hm?

26:27.975 --> 26:29.677
-Aw, hell.
-[Andi] Yeah.

26:30.211 --> 26:32.913
He wanted to talk to her
about child support.

26:32.913 --> 26:34.915
-Did you tell him?
-No!

26:34.915 --> 26:36.550
Well, what?
What?

26:37.918 --> 26:39.487
Zac is the baby's daddy.

26:40.788 --> 26:41.956
He is?

26:42.556 --> 26:44.258
I mean, we're pretty sure of it.

26:45.526 --> 26:46.861
So what happened?

26:46.861 --> 26:48.429
Oh, okay.
I gotta make this quick.

26:48.429 --> 26:49.497
Okay, so...

26:50.231 --> 26:52.233
I went over there, because,
you know, Fatima was over there.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.301
And I just wanna make sure
everything's good, you know?

26:54.301 --> 26:56.770
Just wanna be
the mediator between,

26:56.770 --> 26:58.105
and I was just wondering...

26:58.105 --> 27:00.107
Maybe I should get some teal?

27:00.107 --> 27:01.675
-Ahh.
-I think a wallpaper

27:01.675 --> 27:02.576
should change that.

27:02.576 --> 27:03.844
I was thinkin'...
Yeah.

27:03.844 --> 27:05.079
-A nice periwinkle blue.
-[Andi] Periwinkle.

27:05.079 --> 27:06.814
Robin's egg.
Well, maybe not robin's egg.

27:06.814 --> 27:08.015
I know you tellin' 'em.

27:08.015 --> 27:10.084
-[Andi] Hm?
-What?

27:10.084 --> 27:13.053
Go on...
Tell 'em.

27:14.054 --> 27:16.857
For your information,
I wasn't...

27:18.158 --> 27:20.227
You know you a bad liar, right?

27:20.528 --> 27:21.595
For a lawyer.

27:22.596 --> 27:24.064
Fine, I was telling them.

27:24.064 --> 27:27.034
But I was also saying how proud
of you I am.

27:27.034 --> 27:28.536
For how you handled it.

27:31.038 --> 27:33.207
Did you know they were engaged?

27:36.143 --> 27:37.912
-Karen...
-[Karen] No.

27:38.512 --> 27:39.580
Tell me.

27:39.947 --> 27:41.549
Wait, wait, Zac and Fatima?

27:42.283 --> 27:43.584
[Karen] Yes.

27:43.584 --> 27:45.953
Damn!
That's fast!

27:45.953 --> 27:47.521
Did you know?

27:48.956 --> 27:50.925
Yes, I knew.

27:52.526 --> 27:53.761
And you didn't tell me.

27:54.094 --> 27:56.330
[Andi] It wasn't my business
to tell.

27:56.330 --> 27:58.032
I didn't wanna be the one
to tell you.

27:58.032 --> 27:59.600
What, so I can look like a fool?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.336
Karen, you did not
look like a fool.

28:02.336 --> 28:04.204
-You...
-What kind of friend are you?

28:04.204 --> 28:04.905
Huh?

28:05.539 --> 28:07.641
[Andi] I am a good and
loyal friend.

28:07.641 --> 28:10.044
Yeah, why, I see where
your good and loyal lies.

28:10.811 --> 28:12.446
Karen, that's not fair.

28:12.446 --> 28:14.248
It's not fair.

28:14.248 --> 28:15.683
There's a lot of things
that ain't fair, Andi,

28:15.683 --> 28:18.385
especially that you knew this
the whole time!

28:19.853 --> 28:21.522
That aside...

28:22.323 --> 28:24.224
-Fatima's really cool.
-[Karen] Oh my God.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.859
She's cool, she's cool!

28:26.293 --> 28:28.162
What is that have to do with
you tellin' me

28:28.162 --> 28:30.197
that my ex, whose child
I am carryin',

28:30.197 --> 28:31.966
is engaged to her?

28:31.966 --> 28:35.002
That was your ex's business
to tell you.

28:35.002 --> 28:36.537
-That's true...
-[Karen] Okay.

28:36.537 --> 28:39.173
So I can look like a fool
when I find out, right?

28:39.173 --> 28:40.941
Karen, you did not
look like a fool.

28:40.941 --> 28:42.576
You handled it.
You did.

28:43.877 --> 28:45.279
Okay.

28:47.181 --> 28:48.482
You were great.

28:49.516 --> 28:50.951
And what did she do?

28:53.287 --> 28:56.423
Zac wanted to talk to Karen
about child support.

28:56.423 --> 28:57.625
Child support?

28:58.092 --> 28:59.927
So he does, he does know?

28:59.927 --> 29:02.096
He knows it's his baby.

29:02.096 --> 29:04.231
Okay, so how much?
How much?

29:04.231 --> 29:06.300
-What did he...?
-Karen?

29:06.300 --> 29:08.535
He offered me three grand
a month.

29:10.938 --> 29:13.073
I got to have me a baby!

29:13.073 --> 29:15.042
-I gotta...
-Shut up.

29:15.042 --> 29:16.977
Did you take it?

29:17.711 --> 29:19.279
No, I didn't.

29:20.314 --> 29:22.416
His child support is based
on income.

29:22.883 --> 29:24.918
We should get a lot more
than that.

29:24.918 --> 29:26.553
Since all the money he makes.

29:27.588 --> 29:30.424
And you said you didn't want
that, didn't you?

29:30.991 --> 29:33.093
No, I don't.

29:33.727 --> 29:36.196
-Why the hell not?
-Danni...

29:37.264 --> 29:40.868
Look...
I understand you, Karen.

29:41.468 --> 29:44.171
I'm going through something
that's completely unfair.

29:46.140 --> 29:47.708
[Sabrina] I'm proud of you.

29:48.075 --> 29:49.476
I am, too.

29:50.010 --> 29:52.279
Thank you.
But it's fine.

29:55.449 --> 29:57.317
How are you so cool about this?

30:04.324 --> 30:07.461
I hate to say it,
I really do, but...

30:09.096 --> 30:11.065
My mama was right.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.702
You know, writin' them letters?

30:15.269 --> 30:17.705
Finally sayin' how
I actually feel?

30:18.172 --> 30:20.607
I just feel lighter, you know?

30:21.442 --> 30:24.078
And I mean, Aaron, he's...

30:25.679 --> 30:27.181
What?

30:29.016 --> 30:31.185
I'm just a lot more clear.

30:32.152 --> 30:34.321
That's good.

30:34.722 --> 30:36.223
Are you clear?

30:38.592 --> 30:39.660
Yeah.

30:40.427 --> 30:41.395
I am.

30:42.763 --> 30:43.997
Good.

30:43.997 --> 30:45.466
[Karen] Yeah.

30:45.466 --> 30:46.967
[chuckling]

30:46.967 --> 30:49.002
-Good.
-[Andi] Yeah.

30:49.002 --> 30:50.771
You're not clear, my friend.

30:50.771 --> 30:52.439
-Hm?
-Yes.

30:52.439 --> 30:55.809
Another naked Gary sighting
in this neck of the woods.

30:56.243 --> 30:58.378
Wait...
Did you see him naked?

30:58.378 --> 31:00.781
-No.
-Oh, thank God.

31:00.781 --> 31:02.216
-Well...
-Yeah.

31:02.216 --> 31:03.751
He was waiting to surprise you.

31:04.418 --> 31:05.452
Naked.

31:07.721 --> 31:09.223
So sweet.

31:09.923 --> 31:11.158
I wanna go call him.

31:11.158 --> 31:12.493
Oh my God, right?

31:12.493 --> 31:15.295
He has the key to come
and go as he pleases?

31:16.029 --> 31:17.297
Don't you three?

31:17.798 --> 31:21.101
Well, by golly, you just cannot
argue with that logic.

31:21.101 --> 31:23.370
Mind your business, okay?

31:24.138 --> 31:25.773
Where is my phone?

31:27.641 --> 31:30.344
I have to make a very important
phone call,

31:30.344 --> 31:32.246
-if you'll excuse me.
-So, so important.

31:32.246 --> 31:34.515
Mm-hm.
Very important business.

31:34.515 --> 31:36.617
[crosstalk]

31:38.952 --> 31:43.791
[phone dialing]

31:43.791 --> 31:44.925
Hi.

31:44.925 --> 31:46.193
Hey.

31:46.193 --> 31:48.829
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry.

31:48.829 --> 31:50.564
[Andi]<i> It's okay.</i>

31:51.165 --> 31:52.766
Just wanted to surprise you.

31:53.867 --> 31:55.969
I know.
I heard.

31:56.537 --> 31:59.072
[Gary]<i> Ugh...
I really am sorry.</i>

31:59.072 --> 32:00.340
It's fine.

32:01.108 --> 32:04.378
[Gary]<i> Well, I have the key, but
I will come back and leave it</i>

32:04.378 --> 32:05.913
<i>Because I was only
supposed to lock up.</i>

32:08.048 --> 32:11.752
It would've been nice
if you were here.

32:12.986 --> 32:14.087
Really?

32:14.087 --> 32:15.722
[Andi]<i> Yeah.</i>

32:16.456 --> 32:18.625
Well, how long are they there?

32:19.393 --> 32:21.528
I don't know, actually.

32:21.528 --> 32:25.699
[Gary]<i> Well, call me,
and I'll come back.</i>

32:26.166 --> 32:27.501
Okay.

32:28.302 --> 32:29.803
<i>Where are you going?</i>

32:29.803 --> 32:32.339
I don't know, maybe there's
a basketball game goin' on.

32:33.674 --> 32:34.608
Okay.

32:35.142 --> 32:36.810
I'm gonna try to get rid
of 'em, okay?

32:37.544 --> 32:39.246
[Gary]<i> Well, good luck
with that.</i>

32:40.380 --> 32:42.850
You just make sure you're ready
when you get here.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.118
Oh, I stay ready.

32:45.118 --> 32:46.286
[chuckling]

32:46.286 --> 32:47.855
All right, bye.

32:51.091 --> 32:55.262
[music]

32:56.071 --> 32:57.272
Well, that's not enough to stay.

32:57.272 --> 32:58.440
For her, it is.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.943
[Karen] Well, I'm never gonna
like it.

33:00.943 --> 33:01.877
Ever.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.458
How is he?

33:18.227 --> 33:20.829
We are here to talk about
Sabrina.

33:20.829 --> 33:21.997
How are you?

33:22.297 --> 33:24.099
-I'm fine.
-[Andi] Yeah?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.902
Okay, that's good to know.

33:27.503 --> 33:29.671
Let me tell you what we have.

33:29.671 --> 33:32.307
So regarding the prosecution...

33:32.307 --> 33:34.877
Let me tell you about
the prosecutor.

33:35.444 --> 33:36.678
What's that?

33:38.981 --> 33:42.317
Well, he wants Maurice to
testify against me.

33:42.951 --> 33:44.253
[Andi] What?

33:44.253 --> 33:46.688
-Yeah.
-What an asshole!

33:47.956 --> 33:49.324
He has it out for me.

33:50.058 --> 33:51.093
[Danni] Mm-mm.

33:51.627 --> 33:53.462
He got it out for Andi.

33:55.063 --> 33:56.398
[Sabrina] What?

34:00.002 --> 34:03.839
I defeated the prosecutor
in a divorce case,

34:03.839 --> 34:06.675
and I guess he's still
really mad at me.

34:11.780 --> 34:12.648
Shit.

34:12.648 --> 34:14.917
Now he's taking it out on me.

34:15.450 --> 34:18.520
Okay, but the good news is
I talked to Robin,

34:18.987 --> 34:21.023
and the case is weak.

34:21.757 --> 34:24.493
Apparently Maurice sounded
sarcastic on the tape.

34:24.493 --> 34:27.262
-Maurice is always sarcastic.
-[Andi] Yes, I know.

34:27.262 --> 34:29.198
I know, I know.
I know.

34:29.198 --> 34:30.299
Shit.

34:30.599 --> 34:32.835
He's probably going crazy
in there.

34:32.835 --> 34:34.570
Maybe now...

34:35.304 --> 34:36.772
Why do you say that?

34:39.174 --> 34:41.310
No, I meant like,
maybe now...

34:41.310 --> 34:44.880
He's the belle of the ball.
Holding court.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.415
Be proud of this boy.

34:46.415 --> 34:48.250
Full dance card.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.719
Except, that part.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.055
I mean, can you do something?
Can you try to get him out?

34:53.989 --> 34:55.190
I...

34:55.891 --> 34:58.193
Girl, you know how many favors
I've phoned in for you?

34:58.193 --> 35:00.429
I don't...
I don't think I can.

35:00.429 --> 35:02.164
Honey, mm-mm.

35:02.164 --> 35:03.599
Andi, please, Andi.

35:03.599 --> 35:05.601
Please, can you try?

35:05.601 --> 35:08.337
I cannot ask again!
Mm-mm!

35:10.005 --> 35:13.075
It's sad, it's very sad.
It's very unfortunate.

35:13.842 --> 35:16.345
-Andi, please.
-[Andi] I hate to see it.

35:19.681 --> 35:20.916
Really?

35:25.621 --> 35:27.489
-I can try.
-Thank you.

35:27.489 --> 35:29.625
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

35:29.625 --> 35:30.759
That's all I needed.

35:30.759 --> 35:32.628
-Yeah.
-That's all I need.

35:35.497 --> 35:37.566
Need another drink.
Lord, Jesus.

35:37.566 --> 35:39.601
-You're killin' me.
-Seems like you been drinkin'

35:39.601 --> 35:40.736
-already, Danni.
-I was.

35:40.736 --> 35:43.105
She has, and
she's going to stop.

35:43.872 --> 35:46.775
And she's going to also stop
bringing home strays

35:46.775 --> 35:48.944
she has to run over
with her car.

35:52.547 --> 35:55.450
Well, did you at least talk
to Preston?

35:55.450 --> 35:57.419
Yes, I did.

35:58.887 --> 36:00.122
He's at my house.

36:01.056 --> 36:02.057
That's good.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.092
Why is that good?
Hm?

36:04.092 --> 36:05.594
Why is that good?

36:05.594 --> 36:08.096
Because you can at least be
honest with him for once.

36:08.096 --> 36:10.599
Oh, honesty!
Honesty!

36:10.599 --> 36:13.502
How about I go to the bathroom,
and an engagement ring

36:13.502 --> 36:15.037
falls out of his pants?

36:15.037 --> 36:16.672
-What?
-What?

36:16.672 --> 36:19.708
Preston?
The angel, Preston?

36:19.708 --> 36:20.509
Yeah.

36:20.509 --> 36:22.110
-Wow.
-[Danni] Yeah.

36:22.110 --> 36:24.980
He had a girlfriend before me
and threatened to marry her

36:24.980 --> 36:26.348
if I don't stop him.

36:26.348 --> 36:28.250
And what did you say about that?

36:28.684 --> 36:30.352
Sweetie, I'm here.

36:30.352 --> 36:32.287
And I'm drinking
my troubles away,

36:32.287 --> 36:34.056
not thinking about it, okay?

36:34.056 --> 36:36.625
[sipping]
[music]

36:36.625 --> 36:39.328
No, I'ma drink for
the pregnant woman.

36:39.328 --> 36:40.529
-'Scuse me.
-Thank you.

36:40.529 --> 36:41.730
[Danni] Give me that.

36:43.899 --> 36:44.866
So I'm drinkin'.

36:46.935 --> 36:51.540
I think I, I'll drink for
the pregnant woman, as well.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.108
-Right...
-Do you have apple juice?

36:57.045 --> 36:58.613
Look at this.

36:59.848 --> 37:01.116
Oh my gosh.

37:06.088 --> 37:11.193
[music]

37:11.193 --> 37:12.728
[Fatima] What?

37:13.528 --> 37:14.830
Nothin'.

37:16.098 --> 37:17.232
You sure?

37:17.833 --> 37:19.868
[Zac] I ain't sayin' nothin',
I'm chillin'.

37:21.103 --> 37:22.137
Zac...

37:22.537 --> 37:23.472
What's up?

37:23.872 --> 37:25.607
Why is that still closed?

37:26.441 --> 37:27.943
'Cause I ain't openin' it.

37:28.810 --> 37:30.746
You don't wanna know what
Hayden has planned?

37:31.446 --> 37:32.814
No, I don't.

37:34.683 --> 37:37.586
Okay, well ignorin' it
is not gonna help.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.688
And opening it is not gonna

37:39.688 --> 37:42.024
solve the problem
right now, either, so...

37:44.226 --> 37:45.227
What are you doin'?

37:46.028 --> 37:47.029
Open it.

37:47.629 --> 37:49.564
I am not opening that.
You can...

37:51.500 --> 37:52.801
Okay.

37:54.236 --> 37:55.437
Don't do that.

37:55.437 --> 37:56.605
I'm gonna see.

37:56.605 --> 37:58.240
Fatima, chill, y'all!

37:58.240 --> 37:59.374
I'm going to see.

37:59.374 --> 38:01.109
Fatima, stop...

38:01.109 --> 38:07.049
[music]

38:16.124 --> 38:17.192
What?

38:18.393 --> 38:19.561
Nothin'.

38:20.128 --> 38:21.730
Yo, you can't do that.

38:22.931 --> 38:23.999
Why can't I?

38:24.366 --> 38:26.101
'Cause you know
what it says now.

38:26.101 --> 38:27.235
[Fatima] Yeah, I do.

38:27.502 --> 38:28.937
So tell me what it says!

38:29.938 --> 38:31.740
You don't wanna know, remember?

38:31.740 --> 38:33.742
Yo, you wild childish, yo!

38:34.176 --> 38:36.311
When you gon' grow up?
When you gon' grow up?

38:36.311 --> 38:37.612
Really?

38:37.612 --> 38:38.980
You know you gon' tell me,
so just tell me.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.215
I'm not tellin' you nothin'.

38:43.418 --> 38:45.353
You play too much.

38:45.353 --> 38:47.689

[paper crinkling]

38:47.689 --> 38:49.825
Openin' up people mail and shit.

Yeah.

38:59.468 --> 39:01.203
And he's comin' after you hard.

39:02.104 --> 39:03.472
They can do this?

39:03.472 --> 39:05.307
Yes, in the state of Georgia.

39:05.674 --> 39:07.876
She asked me for $500,000?

39:07.876 --> 39:09.711
Where the -- she get
that number from?

39:10.912 --> 39:12.981
Look Zac, we just gotta see what
the judge says.

39:12.981 --> 39:14.649
Hell no!
I ain't payin' that!

39:14.649 --> 39:17.152
I'll move to Zamunda
before I pay that here!

39:17.152 --> 39:18.420
Oh my God.

39:18.420 --> 39:21.356
Payin' no damn $500,000.
She done lost her damn mind.

39:22.157 --> 39:24.559
[crickets chirping]

39:24.559 --> 39:26.661
That would be perfect.

39:26.661 --> 39:30.632
Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much, thank you.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.903
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:35.337 --> 39:36.705
How are you?

39:36.705 --> 39:38.106
[Preston] I'm good.

39:40.275 --> 39:41.610
[Danni] You good?

39:41.610 --> 39:43.378
Yeah, good.
Yeah, you have fun?

39:43.378 --> 39:45.647
-[Danni] Yeah, I did.
-Good.

39:45.647 --> 39:47.115
Yep.

39:49.184 --> 39:52.387
And you thought about
all that I said?

39:53.054 --> 39:54.689
I did.

39:57.492 --> 40:00.662
Okay, 'cause I was kinda hopin'
that we could talk.

40:02.531 --> 40:04.266
Oh, about that phone call?

40:07.435 --> 40:08.603
Was that her?

40:08.603 --> 40:10.071
Who?

40:10.071 --> 40:10.906
[Danni] Who?

40:11.273 --> 40:12.874
The girl that you were dating
before me,

40:12.874 --> 40:14.209
that you were gonna marry.

40:14.776 --> 40:17.345
Yeah.
It, it was.

40:17.345 --> 40:20.715
Okay, so are you ready to
give her that ring?

40:22.217 --> 40:23.351
What ring?

40:25.587 --> 40:26.988
I saw the ring.

40:29.991 --> 40:31.927
How you know that's for her?

40:34.930 --> 40:37.032
[Danni] This is fun, okay.

40:37.265 --> 40:38.433
[Preston] I mean...

40:38.900 --> 40:41.303
It could be for you,
for all you know.

40:41.303 --> 40:42.637
[Danni] Okay, Preston.

40:42.637 --> 40:44.439
[Preston] Did you put it on?

40:44.439 --> 40:45.874
Why would I do that?

40:46.775 --> 40:48.443
Because it's not hers.

40:50.412 --> 40:51.947
It's yours.

40:56.251 --> 40:57.252
Okay.

40:59.321 --> 41:01.022
I want you to marry me.

41:03.058 --> 41:04.826
Well, well...
Pres...

41:04.826 --> 41:06.895
-[Preston] Yeah, I do.
-What the?

41:06.895 --> 41:10.131
-Danni, Danni.
-Oh my gosh.

41:11.566 --> 41:13.034
I want you...

41:16.271 --> 41:17.939
To marry me.

41:21.543 --> 41:23.144
[Danni] What the hell?

41:27.407 --> 41:28.875
[Narrator]<i> Next on Sistas.</i>

41:28.875 --> 41:30.810
[Fatima]<i> He has a client
named Heather.</i>

41:30.810 --> 41:32.379
<i>I need him to drop her.</i>

41:32.379 --> 41:33.780
I just want you.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.815
Give me a week, he will be doin'
whatever I say.

41:35.815 --> 41:38.151
Preston has asked me
to marry him.

41:38.151 --> 41:39.152
What?

41:39.386 --> 41:40.520
[Danni]<i> Yeah.</i>

41:40.520 --> 41:41.655
What did you say?

41:41.655 --> 41:42.923
I just wanna get to know you.

41:42.923 --> 41:44.791
Just hang out,
drinkin', smokin'.

41:44.791 --> 41:45.959
Can I come over?

41:45.959 --> 41:47.961
It's really cool to have
a powerful boss.

41:47.961 --> 41:49.663
Let's just hope
I stay your boss.

41:49.663 --> 41:51.231
-I was just on the phone.
-Who was that?

41:51.231 --> 41:52.699
[Gary]<i> Andi told Robin
about the call.</i>

41:52.699 --> 41:54.000
He already knows, right?

41:54.000 --> 41:55.001
I think we may have a way out.

42:25.896 --> 42:27.198
