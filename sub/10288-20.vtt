...I spoke too soon.

14:22.544 --> 14:24.574
The truth is....

14:26.046 --> 14:29.136
The truth is I can't do a thing.

14:31.318 --> 14:32.648
BULL:
Yes. you can.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.960
Bull. where you been?

14:40.194 --> 14:41.794
Albany.

14:42.462 --> 14:45.732
Albany? You drove my car
back and forth to Albany?

14:46.165 --> 14:47.715
Sort of.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.160
I drove it forth to Albany.

14:51.603 --> 14:55.443
-My car. Bull. Where is my car?
-You know those new Auto Trains?

14:56.674 --> 14:59.044
The kind where they secure
your vehicle in back...

14:59.210 --> 15:02.150
...and allow you. the weary passenger.
to ride in Pullmans...

15:02.313 --> 15:06.013
...to relax in air-conditioned comfort
while the miles drift by effortlessly?

15:06.182 --> 15:07.452
[CHUCKLES]

15:07.617 --> 15:10.877
-Sure.
-Yours was hit by one.

15:15.525 --> 15:19.115
I couldn't help it.
It stalled right on the tracks. And then...

15:19.296 --> 15:21.696
...I heard that train a-coming.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.060
Just a-coming around the bend.

15:26.603 --> 15:28.003
I knew it!

15:28.171 --> 15:30.141
As soon as I gave him the keys.
I assumed--

15:30.307 --> 15:33.567
I mean. $6000 down the toilet.

15:33.743 --> 15:37.443
Oh. Dan. Dan. this is horrible.

15:37.613 --> 15:40.643
Truly. truly horrible.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.545
What can I say?

15:43.718 --> 15:46.048
-"Whoopee"?
-That's the word.

15:47.422 --> 15:50.522
Bull. why did you go to Albany?

15:50.692 --> 15:52.522
To save Florence.

15:55.463 --> 15:58.693
I. uh. went to the Bureau of Records
to get this.

15:58.866 --> 16:02.296
-What is it?
-Her birth certificate.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.835
-Is that the original?
-Yeah. this is the original.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.908
Look. it's got Florence's maiden name.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.640
"Nightingale"?

16:13.648 --> 16:16.808
I went through hell in grade school.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.875
That document is irreplaceable.

16:19.053 --> 16:21.083
They wouldn't just let you
walk out with it.

16:21.254 --> 16:25.214
They didn't notice me walk in.
I wore a filing cabinet.

16:26.460 --> 16:29.660
Bull. then you're lucky you're not in jail.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.030
Bull. why did you bring this thing
down here?

16:33.033 --> 16:36.093
So we could change it. sir.
So we could erase it...

16:36.269 --> 16:40.429
...or change the numbers. or do whatever
it takes to make Florence young again.

16:40.607 --> 16:42.267
Change it?

16:46.579 --> 16:47.709
[SIGHS]

16:47.913 --> 16:51.543
No. Bull. we can't do that.
It would be wrong.

16:51.717 --> 16:53.337
I don't care.

16:53.853 --> 16:56.013
It was hard enough getting over Selma.

16:56.187 --> 16:58.747
And nobody's gonna make me lose
two friends in one year.

16:58.923 --> 17:01.793
Nobody. You got that? Nobody.

17:03.194 --> 17:06.694
What the hell is the matter with you?

17:06.865 --> 17:10.925
You may not have too much in between.
but you got two ears.

17:11.102 --> 17:14.541
Now. just in case you're not listening
to them. you're gonna listen to me.

17:14.705 --> 17:17.866
Nobody's gonna break any laws
around here. you big ape.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.842
Not on my account.

17:20.612 --> 17:23.082
Well. I'd go to jail for you. Flo.

17:24.449 --> 17:26.608
I know you would.

17:32.856 --> 17:34.756
I know you all would.

17:40.531 --> 17:45.631
Uh. listen. you keep an eye
on these guys. will you?

17:45.803 --> 17:49.333
They need a gutsy broad like you.

17:49.506 --> 17:52.096
Even though you are a goody two-shoes.

17:53.775 --> 17:56.605
Florence. I'm gonna miss you so much.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.248
Aw. cheer up.

17:58.413 --> 18:03.323
I'll put happy faces
on some clamshells for you. huh?

18:10.392 --> 18:15.022
Nobody runs this place better. big guy.

18:15.197 --> 18:16.887
Nobody ever will.

18:21.403 --> 18:24.003
Take care of yourself. Flo.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.821
Dan.

18:36.851 --> 18:37.981
Florence.

18:38.586 --> 18:39.806
You're scum.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.525
Uh. I— I gotta stay alive.

18:56.703 --> 19:01.273
I mean. who's gonna rag you
when you make it to the Supreme Court?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.541
I'll be waiting for you. Flo.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.741
I promise.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.818
Guess who I'm gonna miss
the most of all.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.672
Baby—‘

19:32.638 --> 19:34.868
...you're the greatest.

19:41.479 --> 19:46.539
Now. you give that paper back to him.
or I'll break you in two.

19:54.125 --> 19:58.025
Can't believe he got his hands
on the original. This is priceless.

19:58.195 --> 20:01.825
This is sacred. This is--
Goodness gracious.

20:01.999 --> 20:04.559
Great balls of fire.

20:05.436 --> 20:08.836
-What happened?
-It vanished.

20:09.005 --> 20:11.525
It-- It burned up.

20:11.708 --> 20:14.838
-Just like....
-Magic.

20:21.585 --> 20:24.045
Now. how come everybody's
looking at me?

20:24.220 --> 20:25.310
Without that document...

20:25.488 --> 20:28.118
...we have no sustainable proof
of how old this woman is.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.561
Well. don't get upset. Mr. Marks.

20:30.727 --> 20:35.217
I'm gonna treat you
like any decent woman my age would.

20:37.167 --> 20:39.137
I'm gonna lie like a cheap rug.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.701
This is the happiest night of my life.
Ha. ha.

20:43.872 --> 20:45.462
Me too.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.510
Now. what about that dumb hat?

20:47.675 --> 20:50.935
Oh. uh. I was in a hurry.
so I flew back from Albany.

20:51.579 --> 20:54.509
-You flew?
-Yeah. I paid a guy with a crop-duster.

20:55.216 --> 20:56.876
Where did he land it?

20:57.517 --> 20:58.537
Land it?

21:03.256 --> 21:05.546
It's a long story.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.260
[IN UNISON]
Ooh!

21:10.696 --> 21:14.756
-Thanks. Bull.
-Knee-highs. your favorite.

21:16.502 --> 21:20.062
What did you do.
tear this off a dead Munchkin?

21:22.541 --> 21:24.171
-Dan?
-What?

21:24.343 --> 21:28.443
-They brought your car back from Albany.
-It's about time. Where is it?

21:28.614 --> 21:30.274
Here.

21:36.888 --> 21:38.448
[WHIMPERS]

21:39.391 --> 21:43.791
Just think. Dan. 36 more payments.
and that baby's all yours.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.358
If you'll excuse me.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.474
Gas. wash...

21:57.642 --> 21:59.702
...light on the wax.

22:01.212 --> 22:05.712
Come on. there's a little welcome-home
party for you down in the bailiffs' lounge.

22:05.884 --> 22:07.224
Well. uh. thanks again. Harry.

22:07.385 --> 22:11.615
It takes a lot of magic
to make an old broad feel young again.

22:15.827 --> 22:21.057
Boy. you can sure pull
some amazing rabbits out of your hat. sir.

22:21.232 --> 22:23.502
Mac. I swear I did nothing.

22:23.668 --> 22:27.428
-I am as amazed as the rest of you guys.
-Oh. yeah.

22:27.605 --> 22:31.335
-Oh. yeah.
-If you say so.

22:37.782 --> 22:41.812
-Hi. Miss Sullivan.
-Hi. Dirk. What's with the accordion?

22:41.986 --> 22:46.946
Oh. I just wanted to play a few verses
of "Happy Trails" for Florence.

22:47.726 --> 22:49.286
Oh. Florence isn't leaving.

22:50.428 --> 22:53.358
-She's not?
-Nope. She's staying right here.

22:55.033 --> 22:59.873
Well. I guess I can throw away
this farewell speech I wrote for her.

23:00.537 --> 23:05.737
Oh. that's okay.
Let Miss Goody-Two-Shoes do it for you.
