WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:10.135
- Hi there.
- Are you here to see me?

00:10.135 --> 00:12.220
- No, sadly.
- Balakin.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.557
The Lenkov Company
is a wholly independent entity.

00:15.557 --> 00:19.519
Like many organizations
of well-armed illiterate men,

00:19.519 --> 00:22.689
claims to have connections
at the highest levels in the Kremlin.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.859
Roman Lenkov has a child
with a woman in Cap d'Antibes.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.153
He will be there
on the 30th of this month.

00:28.153 --> 00:32.198
- They're offering us Lenkov.
- Russia... didn't do it?

00:32.198 --> 00:34.534
- Are you replacing Ganon?
- What are you talking about?

00:34.534 --> 00:37.787
The secretary of state takes a long walk
off a short pier... it should be you.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.414
- We're a yes.
- Same.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.833
- The PM isn't gonna love this.
He'll get there.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.544
The president wants
what's best for the UK.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.173
Does he actually believe that the arrest
of some nameless Russian mafioso

00:48.173 --> 00:50.383
will answer the deaths of 40 servicemen?

00:50.383 --> 00:54.512
- What did you say?
- I stood quietly, like a fucking moron,

00:54.512 --> 00:56.681
while Ganon drove a tractor over my face.

00:56.681 --> 01:00.143
I need to call Dennison
and tell him where we're at.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.812
You can call him in the morning.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
Ambassador?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.517
<i>Something odd's happened.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:42.185
You spoke to the PM last night

01:42.185 --> 01:44.229
- about arresting Lenkov?
- Yeah.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.689
- And he was unhappy?
- Yes.

01:46.689 --> 01:50.610
And come the dawn, he's in love with it.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.071
- Really?
- Thrilled.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.241
- With arresting one man.
- And not killing a bunch of Russians.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.742
Odd. No?

01:57.742 --> 02:00.662
He called me an embarrassment
when I raised it.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.332
Remember when you told him that I was
setting him up to be a great statesman?

02:04.332 --> 02:07.627
- Which I most certainly was not.
- It's a good line though, right?

02:07.627 --> 02:08.795
It was.

02:09.712 --> 02:11.923
Do you think he actually bought into it?

02:13.007 --> 02:13.883
Maybe.

02:15.176 --> 02:19.055
Roylin said his real problem
is some election in Scotland.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.181
Off-cycle.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.934
- By-election.
- Does the arrest help him?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.979
A trial does put Britain
back on the world stage.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.147
It's quite good.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.231
It's great.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.525
It backs us off war with Russia.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.195
Ganon and I are traveling to Paris,
to speak to the French.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.530
About the arrest?

02:35.530 --> 02:38.658
Yeah. The PM wants
British Special Forces involved.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.535
Photo op.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.412
Our warriors decked in deadly gear,

02:42.412 --> 02:45.206
marching Lenkov off to justice,
it's, um...

02:46.166 --> 02:47.750
Well, the French will hate it.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.919
Yeah. I mean, they'll come around.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.899
- Wanna go to Paris?
- With you?

03:10.899 --> 03:14.235
Sadly, no. With--
We don't have to get into that now.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.653
Uh, well, now we do.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.614
Anu Kapoor.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.241
- From the Foreign Office?
- Yeah.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.410
Little guy who's afraid of his own shadow?

03:22.410 --> 03:24.245
I think he's a regularly-sized guy.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.997
Why am I going to Paris with him?

03:25.997 --> 03:28.499
Ganon doesn't think
he and Dennison should make the ask.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.877
- He thinks that you should.
- With Anu?

03:30.877 --> 03:33.463
Maybe he wants
a stronger American presence

03:33.463 --> 03:37.383
and a less significant British presence
because France will respond to that.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.845
I'll get you briefing books on Fournier.
That's who you're meeting with.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.096
Minister of the Interior.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.765
I should tell Dennison.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.809
- I can.
- I was just in there,

03:46.809 --> 03:50.104
talking about this,
about him and Ganon going to Paris.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.105
Okay.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.361
It's just kind of weird,
the whole thing is now me and not him,

03:56.361 --> 03:58.279
and I'm not even calling him?

03:58.947 --> 03:59.781
Is it?

04:04.285 --> 04:06.955
You have a meet-and-greet
with representatives

04:06.955 --> 04:09.624
from the National Federation
of Fishermen's Organizations.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.255
<i>Hey.</i>
- How's it going?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.839
-<i>Hal Wyler.</i>
- Did Langley...?

04:16.839 --> 04:17.799
<i>Flagged it.</i>

04:19.425 --> 04:21.761
- I think he could be helpful.
-<i>More.</i>

04:21.761 --> 04:24.138
He's able to provide a lot of context.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.473
On a bunch of things.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.557
<i>Eidra.</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:29.769
He used to work
with a guy named Lewis Quainton.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.021
- They ran into each other at the embassy.
<i>- Okay.</i>

04:32.021 --> 04:34.857
We think Lewis Quainton
is working with the Saudis.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.568
Off the books.
He was here at the embassy--

04:37.568 --> 04:41.114
-<i>You can't use Hal Wyler.</i>
- It'd be a couple conversations.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.865
- Nothing complicated.
-<i>It's a no.</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:45.243
- Why?
-<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

04:46.911 --> 04:48.162
-<i>Thanks for--</i>
- Ma'am?

04:48.997 --> 04:49.831
Why?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.961
<i>The ambassador's on a short list.</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:56.421
- She or he?
-<i>She.</i>

04:56.421 --> 04:58.756
- For what?
-<i>For something high profile.</i>

04:59.549 --> 05:03.219
<i>Something that she can't do
if her husband is a CIA asset.</i>

05:03.219 --> 05:06.723
<i>Talk to Hayford.
Tell him I said that he could read you in.</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:07.890
<i>Hands off Hal.</i>

05:13.271 --> 05:15.023
Hi.
- Hi.

05:15.773 --> 05:20.194
I'm gonna get you a copy of the report
on Lenkov activity in Mali.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.404
State put something out.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.406
- Okay.
- So when you're talking to the French,

05:23.406 --> 05:27.285
you'll wanna remind them how
they got routed by Lenkov troops in Mali.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.248
I called Dennison's office

05:32.248 --> 05:34.709
and I explained the whole deal

05:34.709 --> 05:38.504
with Ganon wanting somebody
lower in the order. So you and Anu.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.382
And Dennison said
that Ganon already called,

05:41.382 --> 05:43.718
and he doesn't like
Ganon's thinking on this,

05:43.718 --> 05:47.013
so he's gonna go on the trip himself.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.267
With you.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.229
Okay.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.038
- Hi.
- Oh! Oh, God. I-- I wasn't--

06:12.038 --> 06:13.664
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.834
I'm packing her--
I was asked to pack the ambassador.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.835
Uh-huh.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.213
Are you going? I can pack you both.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.131
- Uh, where?
- Paris.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.966
Um, I don't know, maybe.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.470
She has a meeting
at the Ministry of the Interior.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.348
That's a lot
for the Ministry of the Interior.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.934
There's some sort of event in the evening.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.435
She's always wearing black.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.771
The office hoped
for something more vibrant.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.398
- Will she hate it?
- She won't wear it.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.194
- What's the dress code?
- Oh, I'm not quite sure of the wording,

06:43.194 --> 06:47.073
but apparently the foreign secretary
is wearing a dinner jacket.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.872
Hey, you ready?
- Sit.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.458
- You get the sandwiches?
- Not yet.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.962
We can get something
and head back here, huh?

07:01.587 --> 07:03.548
You can't sit for three seconds?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.466
My stomach is, like, roaring.

07:05.466 --> 07:09.053
Billie Appiah wants you to read me in
on the ambassador and her short list.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.556
Oh.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.105
Secretary of state?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.022
No.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.109
Vice president.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.778
Okay. Swanky.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.033
- Why are you being weird?
- She said I should read you in?

07:31.033 --> 07:32.201
Yeah.

07:35.121 --> 07:39.333
The vice president is getting tossed.
And they may want Kate to step in.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.794
Like, soon... ish.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.962
Wow.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.005
Yeah.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.800
Six people know. And now you.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.721
- Worried I can't keep it under my hat?
- No.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.389
Why are you read in?

07:53.389 --> 07:56.517
- You're one of six?
- Well, now seven.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.560
Because why?

07:58.686 --> 08:00.271
Because she's not VP material.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.567
They want you to do your thing.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.277
Yeah.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.737
That's great!

08:07.737 --> 08:09.071
I'm really hungry.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.364
Congratulations.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.827
I'd go back to D.C.

08:15.786 --> 08:16.787
If it worked out.

08:19.790 --> 08:20.625
When?

08:21.542 --> 08:22.502
I don't know.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.380
A week, a month, a year?

08:26.380 --> 08:30.510
No. Maybe four months, you know.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.595
If it happens.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.390
You know, the ambassador
fucking hates the idea.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.769
I heard she wore a gray suit.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.188
- The ambassador.
- Yeah.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.692
That was you?

08:46.692 --> 08:49.070
I got her a suit, it's not a ring.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.115
You told me not to go to Cairo.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.826
It's not like it was a premeditated thing.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.078
Fucking of my career?

08:59.038 --> 09:02.708
I'm sorry. If you think there was any way
I would ever, ever--

09:02.708 --> 09:07.463
You wanted to go public
with a relationship that's about to end.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.883
- How about you sit down?
- Why would you do that?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.301
It's not about to end.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.471
- I kind of think it just did.
- Eidra.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.768
Howard,
can you bring in the Tuesday report?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.228
I wanna go over it with you.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.145
Eidra.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.108
You gotta walk out of my office right now.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.446
I don't think this is where we'll land,
but it's worth taking a look before--

09:33.489 --> 09:36.409
Oh, sorry.
I can't talk about this with you here.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.672
Darya called me
and I didn't call back. Twice.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.049
- Have Jill call her.
- Jill's busy.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.301
So are you.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.387
Jill's trying to re-open
our diplomatic mission in Afghanistan.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.888
Jill is trying to get people out.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.057
Jill is doing everything
I was supposed to be doing.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.310
- You want me to call Darya?
- Not the point.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.645
- I mean, yeah, but--
- What's the point?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.148
I fucking dumped her.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.860
Like everyone else has done
to every democracy-oriented Afghan

10:10.860 --> 10:12.028
throughout time.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.823
You mentored her, right?
She knows how to apply for a grant.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.782
She won't get it.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.868
- Everyone's moved on to something else.
- Yeah.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.454
Trying to avoid armed conflict
between Russia and NATO.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.205
You're getting it everywhere.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.457
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.335
They'll kick us out
when they realize we're soiling the place.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.004
I don't think you should be eating
shitty British croissants.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.173
You're gonna be having
the real deal tomorrow.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.884
In your Parisian boudoir.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.803
I know,
but I'm kind of into the British version.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.264
They're bready. I like it.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.101
Me and Pensy packed you.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.395
For Paris.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.022
Okay. Thanks.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.942
She made some bold choices,
I thought I should weigh in.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.028
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:54.028 --> 10:54.987
Red gown.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.782
- For fuck's sake.
- Why not?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.910
For the Minister of the Interior?
Red is not the move.

11:00.910 --> 11:05.289
I think it was for the ball
you're going to with Austin Dennison.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.333
It's not a ball.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.001
Yeah. Long dress.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.211
- Red?
- Yeah.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.296
I told her to pack a black one.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.174
Just in case you want
to dial it down, you know.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.467
Mm.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.303
So it's not the prom, I can wear my suit.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.764
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.273
What's happening right now?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.985
With me? Nothing.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.987
Literally, nothing.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.114
Okay.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.077
I packed your bag.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.371
Nobody asked you to do that.

11:45.371 --> 11:49.834
Frances is going to
the Chelsea Flower Show to choose bulbs.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.086
She asked me to come along.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.462
Don't go.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.798
I don't have
any fucking other thing to do.

11:55.798 --> 12:00.136
That is not what I meant
when I said we'd find stuff for you to do.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.262
What did you mean?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.974
Well, I don't know.
I haven't figured out every piece of it.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.601
I don't have
a ton of brain space right now.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.695
Do you wanna come? On the trip?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.073
- To Paris?
- Yeah.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.286
To keep my mouth shut in Paris
instead of London?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.203
Hal.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.497
Sit in a hotel room,
fuck you when you get back?

12:28.497 --> 12:29.832
Is that so bad?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.209
Will you put on the red dress?

12:34.336 --> 12:38.924
I don't want us to turn into some bizarro,
trying-to-keep-it-fresh couple

12:38.924 --> 12:40.301
on the far side of the hill.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.761
- It was your idea.
- To come on the trip.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.472
Not on the red dress.

12:45.139 --> 12:45.973
Not nice.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.229
I knew this was a bad idea.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.775
- What?
- Another ride on the merry-go-round.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.776
Fuck you, Kate.

12:58.777 --> 12:59.612
I mean it.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.742
I don't know how we'll fix this marriage,
but it's not something we've done before.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.412
Common courtesy dictates
that if we're gonna make this work,

13:08.412 --> 13:11.165
you don't yell "divorce"
every time I open my mouth.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.292
But the things you say are so stupid.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.838
It was a joke.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.881
It wasn't funny.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.138
I was supposed to do a speech
at Chatham House.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.350
But I can't do it
because of the trip to Paris.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.229
You're supposed to say you're proud of me
because I agreed to do a speech.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.731
- I hate speeches.
- Do you?

13:36.690 --> 13:39.235
I said yes because I listen to you.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.655
Makes all the difference.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.572
You do it.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.616
The speech.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.702
You'll kill it. It's all upside.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.289
You don't want that.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.124
I do, actually.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.379
I did stuff I was good at
when you were ambassador.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.884
You weren't threatened by it,
you were thrilled.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.720
I'm trying to rise to the occasion.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.222
You're placating me.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.974
Maybe. Is it working?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.144
That's not fair.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.938
It is working.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.942
You can't buy me off
with a speech at Chatham House.

14:19.942 --> 14:24.530
There is significant evidence
to the contrary.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.952
The draft title
was "Talking to Terrorists,"

14:29.952 --> 14:32.413
which is sort of counter to U.S. policy,

14:32.413 --> 14:35.916
so I went to Public Affairs
and they like "Communication is Key."

14:35.916 --> 14:37.126
What is this?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.794
The Chatham House speech.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.922
It'll start with the general idea that,
well, communication is key,

14:41.922 --> 14:45.885
then get into specifics from the fall
of the Soviet Union, the Bosnia talks.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.346
Ronnie, she's going to Paris.
She's not doing the Chatham House speech.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.806
No, he is.

14:50.806 --> 14:51.765
Mr. Wyler.

14:51.765 --> 14:55.394
That's why it's back on your calendar.
He's gonna waive the Chatham House Rule.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.563
And he asked me to send a copy
to Billie Appiah.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.232
I don't wanna do that
if you're not happy with the title.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.572
Ma'am, there's been a mix-up.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.366
I take responsibility.

15:09.366 --> 15:13.621
I've been distracted with Paris
and everything else.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.999
Somebody thought it would be a good idea

15:16.999 --> 15:19.168
for Mr. Wyler to do your speech.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.670
The Chatham House speech.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.422
Yeah. Me.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.884
- Ma'am.
- Hal's like a racehorse.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.386
You gotta run him,
or he'll tear down the barn.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.101
Are you familiar
with the Chatham House Rule?

15:37.144 --> 15:39.647
Anything you say can be cited,

15:39.647 --> 15:41.732
but it can't be attributed to you.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.568
It's bad for public image building.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.527
Okay.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.741
Mr. Wyler asked to waive
the Chatham House Rule for the speech.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.244
Okay.

15:56.246 --> 15:59.500
He asked to have
the speech sent to Billie Appiah.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.301
Thank you.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.933
Ma'am, it's time to go.

16:24.149 --> 16:28.195
<i>Our original scheduled speaker
was abruptly called away.</i>

16:28.195 --> 16:30.364
<i>Struggling to fill her shoes</i>

16:30.364 --> 16:33.617
is her husband, Ambassador Hal Wyler.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.209
Thank you.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.175
We started the Bosnia talks

16:50.759 --> 16:55.681
a few days after Suljic launched
a bombing campaign

16:55.681 --> 16:59.143
that very nearly killed
the woman who's now my wife.

17:01.103 --> 17:05.733
It was my lot to spend more hours
in locked rooms with that man

17:05.733 --> 17:07.651
than in the hospital with Kate.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.031
First time I met him,
I refused to shake his hand.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.284
Rookie move.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.038
It probably set the peace back a year.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.625
Communication isn't the key.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.505
<i>Diplomacy doesn't open doors
with a twist of the wrist.</i>

17:28.505 --> 17:31.091
<i>Diplomacy never works.</i>

17:32.926 --> 17:34.303
It never fucking works.

17:34.803 --> 17:39.725
Diplomacy is 40 days and nights
in a Vienna hotel room,

17:39.725 --> 17:43.187
<i>listening to the same
empty talking points.</i>

17:43.187 --> 17:44.980
<i>Getting trashed at the minibar.</i>

17:45.856 --> 17:51.278
<i>It's getting to "no"
over, and over, and over.</i>

17:51.278 --> 17:53.864
The answer will be "no,"
so don't stop when you hear it.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.325
You can ask me to leave the room.
That'll take it up a level.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.162
Then mention the fact that I was sent here
as an insult to both of you,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.705
but maybe you rise above it.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.208
Diplomacy never works.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.462
Until it does.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.135
I've given 30 years of my life
for two moments.

18:16.887 --> 18:21.475
When enemies stood
on blood-soaked ground...

18:22.726 --> 18:23.977
and grasped hands.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.188
I'd give it 30 more.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.527
The second round of talks with Suljic...

18:32.694 --> 18:33.821
I shook his hand.

18:34.863 --> 18:40.536
Two years later,
he was a tired man hoping for peace,

18:40.536 --> 18:43.163
and together...

18:44.915 --> 18:45.916
we ended the war.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.922
One of the boneheaded truisms
of foreign policy

18:51.922 --> 18:56.218
is that talking to your enemies
legitimizes them.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
Talk to everyone.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.766
Talk to the dictator,
and the war criminal.

19:02.766 --> 19:06.353
Talk to the poor schmuck three levels down
who's so pissed he has to sit

19:06.353 --> 19:08.897
in the back of the second car,
he may be ready to turn.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.440
Talk to terrorists.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.317
Talk to everyone.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.320
Fail, and fail again.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.032
And brush yourself off.
And fail again. Because maybe...

19:20.951 --> 19:21.952
Maybe.

19:23.162 --> 19:23.996
Yeah.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.589
I wish we could be of assistance.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.925
But, I regret to say,
what you request is quite impossible.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.843
Why is that?

19:37.843 --> 19:41.889
Our government is not prepared
to further strain relations with Russia.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.682
- Nor is ours.
Of course.

19:43.682 --> 19:48.937
But we hope to play a key role
in the end of Russia's regional conflicts.

19:49.646 --> 19:54.610
We've invested significant time
building bridges between the parties.

19:54.610 --> 19:59.823
We've received a strong indication that
this would not unduly displease Moscow.

19:59.823 --> 20:03.744
Whether or not
Moscow is privately relieved,

20:03.744 --> 20:07.039
their public reaction
is unlikely to reflect that.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.042
The Lenkov Company
framed your soldiers in Mali

20:10.042 --> 20:12.628
for a massacre
they perpetrated themselves.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.632
And now it looks like they framed Iran
for an attack on Britain.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.009
How is this not
an attractive proposition--?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.053
If we had assurances

20:21.053 --> 20:24.890
that Moscow would not condemn the arrest,

20:25.682 --> 20:29.144
would you give the proposal
a more serious consideration?

20:29.144 --> 20:35.484
In times like this, we wish you were still
a member of the European Union.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.362
We perhaps could've found
a solution as a group.

20:38.362 --> 20:42.366
For France alone,
with deepest sympathies for your loss,

20:42.950 --> 20:45.202
I'm afraid the answer remains "no."

20:50.207 --> 20:51.875
Truly inspiring.
Thank you.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.087
- Nice to see you. Thank you.
- Mr. Wyler.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.423
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Look how surprised you are.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.968
- Excellent address. Truly impressive.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.552
Thank you. A great crowd here.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.596
Uh, I wonder if I could take
a moment of your time.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.764
Sure.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.849
I'm not sure this is the place.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.435
Find something to eat?
I should go to the hotel

21:10.435 --> 21:12.271
- and get some work done.
- All right.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.527
I realize we knew
this was an exercise in futility,

21:18.527 --> 21:20.404
but it would've helped things on my end

21:20.404 --> 21:22.447
if I were able
to go back to the White House

21:22.447 --> 21:23.782
and say I did what I could.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.536
- Did you not?
- I think I looked disapproving.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.496
And that's been known to shake the earth.

21:29.496 --> 21:34.126
But if I'd had an opportunity to actually,
I don't know, speak--

21:34.126 --> 21:36.169
She was never gonna budge
with both of us there,

21:36.169 --> 21:38.422
as you said
when we walked through the door.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.508
She looked for an opportunity
to tut-tut me about Brexit.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.219
- She'll say yes when it's one-on-one.
- Great.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.597
You can pull her aside
at the event tonight, wrap it up.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.765
Not me, you.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.393
I interrupted you.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.396
And then gave you
a chiding shake of the head.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.565
Makes women furious.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.317
She clocked it too.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.110
You never have to mention it,

22:00.110 --> 22:04.197
but you'll have an unspoken bond
built around your shared irritation.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.074
With me.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.955
Let's get some food.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.540
Hmm.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.588
You don't think it's a little simplistic?

22:21.256 --> 22:22.090
I-- What?

22:22.090 --> 22:25.677
I'm gonna walk in there
and roll my eyes and say, "Men."

22:25.677 --> 22:28.597
And then she's gonna be like,
"I know, <i>mon dieu."</i>

22:30.015 --> 22:32.934
- When you put it like that--
- How should I put it?

22:32.934 --> 22:36.063
Like the U.S.
has no voice in the EU anymore.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.857
We were that, then we Brexited

22:38.857 --> 22:43.153
in one of the great self-inflicted wounds
of modern history.

22:43.153 --> 22:47.449
And now you have no inside ear
or eye or mouthpiece.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.784
At the EU?

22:48.784 --> 22:49.910
Yeah.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.037
You weren't a mouthpiece.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.414
Nobody described it that way
in our absence?

22:54.414 --> 22:55.624
Um...

22:56.500 --> 22:57.334
Well, maybe.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.005
We're no longer that window for you.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.465
Into Europe.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.674
France could be.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.927
I'm not inventing the wheel.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.805
Rayburn mentioned it
in a speech a few days ago.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.348
Yeah.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.351
So it's not them doing something for us,

23:14.351 --> 23:18.396
it's them doing something
for their new silent partner, you.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.528
Go ahead.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.113
What?

23:27.572 --> 23:30.367
I'm waiting
for the deluge of withering dissent.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.413
No. I think you're right.
Which is me agreeing with you.

23:35.413 --> 23:40.377
So... objection is rapid-fire and loud

23:40.377 --> 23:43.213
while approval
is best conveyed in silence.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.340
I was eating.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.884
You do it without food.

23:47.884 --> 23:51.263
I know when you agree because
you walk away without saying a word.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.305
I do not.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.267
I do.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.893
It's terrible.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.395
It's endearing.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.397
Once you know what's going on.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.274
Before that, it can be hard to follow.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.528
Were you ever staff?

24:08.655 --> 24:09.489
I know the answer.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.741
I read about you on the Internet.
You weren't.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.618
I suppose not.

24:13.618 --> 24:18.165
You went from big leadership position
to bigger leadership position.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.459
Staff learns to talk fast,

24:21.459 --> 24:25.881
reduce complexity into a phrase
someone can memorize while they're peeing.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.966
That is beautiful.
I will always remember it.

24:27.966 --> 24:31.678
It's true. Nobody wants to be briefed.
You gotta chase them into the toilet.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.723
Especially if it's about women
getting their tongues cut out.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.891
It's a buzzkill.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.353
Sorry, it's Hal.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.063
Go ahead.

24:45.483 --> 24:46.318
Hey.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.402
How did it go?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.653
<i>As expected.</i>

24:48.653 --> 24:51.364
We're gonna take another crack
at her tonight at the thing.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.867
How did the speech go?

24:53.867 --> 24:55.410
Oh, fine.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.287
Uncharacteristically modest.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.456
No, you're right. It went great.

25:00.290 --> 25:04.169
I-- There was this Tory MP.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.880
He came up to me after.
He was desperate to talk.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.341
<i>- I'm gonna meet him for a drink tonight.</i>
- Who?

25:09.341 --> 25:10.634
<i>Um, Merritt Grove?</i>

25:10.634 --> 25:11.843
Grave? Grove?

25:12.677 --> 25:13.845
And you're meeting him?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.889
- He said it was urgent.
- Hal, Jesus.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.058
He wanted to talk to you,
but you're not here.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.603
If he's asking to talk to me, it's not
'cause he wants a Wyler's perspective.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.856
He wants a representative
of the president of the United States.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.151
Take a breath, please.
I told him. I said exactly that.

25:28.151 --> 25:32.197
I said, "Look, I'm not fucking anyone.
I'm a trophy wife."

25:32.197 --> 25:34.366
I offered to put him
on the phone with Billie,

25:34.366 --> 25:37.285
<i>- but he didn't want that.</i>
- Tell me you didn't.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.120
I didn't. He didn't wanna talk to her.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.457
Tell me you didn't offer
to call the White House chief of staff

25:42.457 --> 25:44.793
for somebody
who sucked up to you at a party.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.503
- Kate.
- How many ways are you gonna find to

25:46.503 --> 25:51.132
- wag your ass in front of Billie Appiah?
- I told you twice and I'll say it again,

25:51.132 --> 25:53.260
he did not wish to speak to Billie Appiah.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.389
You're chasing secretary of state.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.183
What?

26:00.183 --> 26:01.977
You told me to burn him.

26:01.977 --> 26:05.355
You told me to take down
the fucking secretary of state.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.273
This is why?

26:06.273 --> 26:09.192
<i>- Because you wanna be secretary of state?</i>
- Jesus Christ.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.611
Me as vice president
was something to keep you busy

26:11.611 --> 26:13.530
until you found a better job?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.699
- This is delusional.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

26:15.699 --> 26:18.159
- You will not meet him. Understand?
<i>- No.</i>

26:18.159 --> 26:20.829
I don't because that'd make me
look like a fucking tool.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.498
- What was his name? The guy?
- Merritt Grove.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.750
My office will call him
and cancel your meeting.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.129
You will not call him.
You'll call no one. You hear me?

26:29.129 --> 26:30.130
You know what, Kate?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.464
<i>- No one.</i>

26:45.895 --> 26:47.772
<i>Ah. Now we're chums.</i>

26:47.772 --> 26:50.025
- Calling for a chin wag?
<i>- Okay.</i>

26:50.692 --> 26:51.526
You all right?

26:52.485 --> 26:53.862
Who's Merritt Grove?

26:53.862 --> 26:54.904
<i>He's an MP.</i>

26:54.904 --> 26:59.117
Tory. You'd describe him
as a compassionless conservative.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.577
We just call him old.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.246
- Did you work with him?
<i>- Glancingly.</i>

27:03.246 --> 27:04.914
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Are you ill?

27:04.914 --> 27:09.919
No. Hal met him at an event and tried
to put him in touch with the White House.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.005
He wanted to speak with the president?

27:12.005 --> 27:14.674
I don't know what he wanted.
He wanted to talk to someone right away

27:14.674 --> 27:17.677
and Hal offered
the White House chief of staff,

27:17.677 --> 27:21.181
which, apparently,
even Mr. Grove knew was absurd.

27:21.181 --> 27:24.434
So then Hal offered Hal.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.518
Ah.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.937
I can't meet with him
for a couple of days. I'm in Paris.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.691
Things with Grove are always urgent.
He's a bit of an hysteric.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.778
Can I push him off
or send someone to talk to him?

27:34.778 --> 27:36.196
Of course. Delegate.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.031
- I'm not burning a bridge?
<i>- No.</i>

27:38.031 --> 27:39.991
Godspeed with the Gauls.

27:46.539 --> 27:50.001
I'm sorry, I do--
I just need to walk for a minute.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.379
- We can walk.
- You don't have to come.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.216
Of course.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.803
It's not what I meant. I'm...

28:01.137 --> 28:01.971
Let's walk.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.433
Warren, we're talking on the go.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.364
Everything all right?

28:21.074 --> 28:22.951
I'm fine. Don't worry about it. It's a...

28:24.619 --> 28:26.329
personal-- whatever.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.333
I didn't mean to pry.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.337
You're not.
I'm melting down in front of you.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.881
We should be talking about the French.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.926
Is this what melting down looks like?

28:39.926 --> 28:41.803
- You don't think so?
- No.

28:41.803 --> 28:45.140
When you run, sweating,
into my office with instruction,

28:45.140 --> 28:47.559
- that looks like melting down.
- Oh, God.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.438
Again, endearing once decoded.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.523
I sweat a lot.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.734
It's not tied to my emotional state.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.575
My marriage is ending.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.285
Again.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.831
I thought that was already underway.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.125
It was, and then...

29:14.377 --> 29:15.295
it wasn't.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.296
Oh, God.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.214
I'm gonna vomit.

29:18.214 --> 29:21.301
I'm not walking on the Seine
and bitching to you about my marriage.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.011
It's like, ugh.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.846
- We could stand still.
- No.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.973
I invite you to get it off your chest

29:26.973 --> 29:32.937
because the sweating is in fact tied
to your emotional state and has begun.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.571
I feel like the stand-up thing to do

29:41.571 --> 29:46.034
is to give a relationship
every possible chance. Right?

29:46.034 --> 29:50.914
I mean, it's the whole fucking definition
of my life's work.

29:50.914 --> 29:53.082
There's nothing you can't talk out.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.417
Of course.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.378
But at a certain point...

29:58.296 --> 30:04.761
I'm a moron for failing to learn a lesson
I have been taught a thousand times.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.678
No.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.682
At this point, I'm a fucking moron.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.728
Perhaps you're just a decent person

30:13.728 --> 30:18.316
in a time when decency has lost its hold
on the public imagination.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.197
Standing room only apparently.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.367
- I'll send you a clip.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.745
I gotta go.

30:30.745 --> 30:31.704
Okay.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.665
- Well, she call you?
Yeah.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.416
In a tizzy?

30:35.416 --> 30:37.126
She's just trying to be careful.

30:37.126 --> 30:42.423
Well, she's probably undercaffeinated.
It's a disservice to the nation.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.551
I'll meet the guy from Chatham House.

30:44.551 --> 30:48.137
Ronnie will come along and take notes,
make it feel like embassy business.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.055
Really?

30:49.055 --> 30:50.974
Yeah. It's best way to learn, right?

30:50.974 --> 30:51.891
Um...

30:53.560 --> 30:56.604
How about I come along,
just do a bit of a handover?

30:56.604 --> 31:00.525
Sir, I'm not having a great day.
Can we just go with a no?

31:00.525 --> 31:04.487
You think a five-minute handoff
is gonna bring down the republic?

31:07.115 --> 31:08.658
Fine. Five minutes.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.706
The whole enterprise is-- is porous.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.332
Intentionally.

31:16.332 --> 31:19.127
We throw parties,
people come to the house.

31:19.127 --> 31:22.881
I go to fucking literary societies,
ramble about conflict resolution

31:22.881 --> 31:25.884
while drinking port
that is very old and not good,

31:25.884 --> 31:28.678
and someone wants to talk.

31:28.678 --> 31:31.639
It's actually what we're after, right?

31:31.639 --> 31:34.726
You're sharp as a tack,
and one day you're gonna run this place,

31:34.726 --> 31:39.105
but Archibald Highnostril
is not gonna say a fucking thing

31:39.105 --> 31:42.233
with 12-year-old Ronnie taking notes.

31:46.696 --> 31:47.614
There's a line.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.408
It's porous, but it's there.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.245
And when you vault all the way over it,

31:54.245 --> 31:57.624
the rest of us
spend all our time compensating.

31:57.624 --> 32:01.794
Then people like Ronnie have to
sit in meetings and awkwardly take notes

32:01.794 --> 32:06.925
to prove to the world that the White House
is not a fee-for-services organization.

32:10.762 --> 32:17.226
I think you should take a moment
and decide if you really wanna suggest...

32:18.645 --> 32:20.563
that I'm selling access, Stuart.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.911
<i>I told him not to come.
But he said five minutes.</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:36.454
-<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

32:36.454 --> 32:38.581
<i>I can try to cancel the whole thing.</i>

32:39.290 --> 32:40.541
Don't worry about it.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.126
<i>Five and he's out.</i>

32:42.126 --> 32:44.587
Yeah. Good luck with that.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.672
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

33:06.567 --> 33:07.527
<i>Ambassador?</i>

33:07.527 --> 33:10.571
Could you tell the foreign secretary
to go on ahead without me?

33:10.571 --> 33:12.490
<i>- Of course, ma'am.</i>
- Thanks.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.046
It's nice to see you.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.672
I'm glad you could join us.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.342
Could we talk for a minute?
Of course.

34:56.469 --> 35:01.599
I come to events here and give myself
a few minutes alone with one of them.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.937
I try to treat them as individuals.

35:06.729 --> 35:07.605
Not a horde.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.363
He crowned himself.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.073
Napoleon.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.660
Simplified matters considerably.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.953
It did.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.539
You will ask me for a favor.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.917
It will, no doubt, improve my life.

35:27.917 --> 35:28.960
Mm.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.296
Have you given
any more thought to the proposal?

35:32.296 --> 35:36.676
Yes. However, this British request
is not as you describe.

35:36.676 --> 35:37.593
Why not?

35:37.593 --> 35:42.598
Typically, an arrest on French soil
would be conducted by French police.

35:43.641 --> 35:49.730
London has asked that
their special operatives take the lead.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.400
They need to avenge the 41 fallen sailors.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.988
British Special Forces on the scene
when Lenkov is taken into custody...

35:57.989 --> 35:58.906
it's a start.

35:58.906 --> 36:02.160
This highly unorthodox request...

36:03.369 --> 36:07.540
being of import to our great
and good friend, the United States,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.752
we shall reluctantly grant it.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.004
We appreciate that.

36:13.004 --> 36:17.133
But one must register surprise
that the present U.S. administration,

36:17.133 --> 36:20.511
after pointedly proclaiming
a break with the past,

36:20.511 --> 36:25.099
would so strongly lobby
for an extrajudicial assassination.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.561
We're talking about an arrest.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.314
My colleagues on the intelligence side

36:32.273 --> 36:37.445
tell me that the British do not intend
to let Roman Lenkov walk out alive.

36:40.656 --> 36:43.826
We applaud you
for returning the 26 statues.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.412
Britain will follow suit.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.914
So many excuses.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.714
...to your commitment to leadership?
Is that a thing of the past?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.966
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.553
Kate?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.347
Ambassador.

37:05.806 --> 37:06.807
She signed off.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.101
Well done.

37:10.102 --> 37:13.231
They-- They have champagne up there.
Perhaps a toast--

37:13.231 --> 37:15.608
I don't feel great.
I'm gonna go back to the hotel.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.526
- Well, I'll walk you.
- That's all right.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.072
Kate.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.286
I have the DCM for Ms. Park,
is she available?

37:29.163 --> 37:29.997
Unbelievable.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.583
Can you ask her to get back to us
when she has a moment?

37:32.583 --> 37:33.668
Not gonna happen.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.045
Maybe she's sick or something.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.673
- She's not answering any of our calls.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.632
Mr. Wyler?

37:39.632 --> 37:41.717
<i>You should give me
a half hour alone with him.</i>

37:41.717 --> 37:43.427
- Let me explain.
<i>Sir, no.</i>

37:43.427 --> 37:45.137
Go tell the guy I'm coming.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.265
The ambassador--

37:47.265 --> 37:49.892
The ambassador blows her coat
every time I open my mouth.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.435
- Don't let it rattle you.
- Hal.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.854
She's got you convinced
I'm a monkey with a shotgun,

37:53.854 --> 37:56.482
but sometimes
an apology is just an apology.

37:56.482 --> 37:59.860
"I was gonna buy you a drink,
now I'm not gonna buy you a drink. Sorry."

37:59.860 --> 38:02.446
- I'll buy him two drinks.
- He doesn't want two from you.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.866
You work for the State Department.
You'll buy him a shitty cabernet. Twice.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.835
Mr. Grove, I'm Ronnie Buckhurst.
I work with Stuart Hayford.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.212
- He's stuck on a call. He'll be right in.
- Who?

38:18.212 --> 38:21.382
Stuart Hayford.
Deputy Chief of Mission at Embassy London.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.009
Where's Mr. Wyler?

38:23.009 --> 38:26.178
Mrs. Wyler is the ambassador.
She asked Mr. Hayford to meet with you.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.389
No.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.225
I would appreciate a moment alone.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.185
At least take my coat. It's freezing.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.103
I'm fine.

38:34.687 --> 38:35.646
I can see that.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.191
Okay, give me your fucking coat.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.950
- Have you been playing me?
- What on--?

38:47.950 --> 38:50.411
Asking for an arrest
when all along it's been a hit?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.747
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.124
Lenkov's assassination.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.294
French police
have been instructed to stand down.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.797
While British Special Forces
conduct a bin Laden-style raid

39:01.797 --> 39:03.632
to take out Roman Lenkov.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.593
- That's absurd.
- It's what's happening.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.095
- We don't assassinate people.
- We don't either.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.472
Except when we do.

39:09.472 --> 39:12.725
Trowbridge wouldn't.
It would bring down his government.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.893
And why?

39:13.893 --> 39:16.270
If he can arrest Lenkov,

39:16.270 --> 39:19.273
learn who hired him,
and rain hellfire on them,

39:19.273 --> 39:21.067
that is worth something.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.195
A dead Lenkov doesn't do him any good.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.404
He said it was too slow.

39:25.404 --> 39:28.074
- An arrest.
- So he issued a kill order?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.367
- Apparently.
- No.

39:30.117 --> 39:30.951
Unless he...

39:31.619 --> 39:32.453
What?

39:32.453 --> 39:35.081
There's an exception,
under the Intelligence Services Act.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.000
But that-- that requires authorization.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.585
- He authorized it.
- He can't.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.296
- It needs approval and a signature.
- From who?

39:43.339 --> 39:44.173
Me.

39:46.258 --> 39:48.219
Maybe there's a request I missed.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.346
They won't put a kill request
in your e-mail.

39:50.346 --> 39:54.517
Yes, but a request for a certain type
of meeting, where it would be authorized.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.603
- Is that your work phone?
- Yes.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.980
- A government-issued phone?
- It's where they would send it.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.858
- Give it to me.
- Just give me one moment.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.236
- What are you doing?

40:06.612 --> 40:09.365
- Warren!
What the fuck?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.827
Listen to me. A dead Lenkov is only good
for the people who hired him.

40:12.827 --> 40:17.915
A dead Lenkov is only good
for the people who hired him.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.962
If Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge
wants him dead...

40:25.423 --> 40:27.049
Nicol Trowbridge hired him.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.054
I was expecting Mr. Wyler.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.890
I do not wish to speak
to anyone from your embassy.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.601
- Mr. Grove. Sorry I'm late.
- Mr. Grove. Merritt!

42:30.714 --> 42:32.299

42:32.299 --> 42:34.385

42:37.846 --> 42:39.223

42:39.223 --> 42:41.684

42:46.772 --> 42:48.399

42:48.399 --> 42:51.151
<i>We suspected comms failure.
Transmitting in the blind.</i>

42:55.155 --> 42:57.283
<i>Dolphin 3-6, nothing heard. Out.</i>
