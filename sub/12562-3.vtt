00:01.667 --> 00:02.366
Dad?

00:02.367 --> 00:03.267
What?

00:03.269 --> 00:06.170
In 48 hours, you're going to prison.

00:06.172 --> 00:09.040
I finally realized what I want right now,

00:09.042 --> 00:11.709
and... it's not here.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.707
When are you going back to Uruguay?

00:15.468 --> 00:16.572
Maybe you could help me.

00:16.574 --> 00:18.905
- Is it medical in nature?
- Yes.

00:18.907 --> 00:20.072
I'm just a little concerned

00:20.074 --> 00:21.409
about my knowing something about you

00:21.411 --> 00:22.608
that you don't want him to know.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.108
No, please,

00:24.110 --> 00:28.219
just don't say anything to Evan, okay?

00:38.585 --> 00:41.858
This space is so much
bigger than I remember.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.160
It is really big.

00:44.162 --> 00:48.037
So... what do you think?

00:48.039 --> 00:49.640
I think we need to start cleaning.

00:49.642 --> 00:53.451
We need to start celebrating.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.819
Stella.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.489
Relax, Kate, come on. It's the cheap stuff.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.627
This is a big moment.

00:58.629 --> 01:00.362
I mean, no more cleaning people's houses.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.998
It's the end of our days as maids

01:02.000 --> 01:04.101
and the beginning of our days as queens.

01:04.102 --> 01:06.304
Uh, retail queens.

01:06.306 --> 01:08.206
Stella, we talked about this.

01:08.208 --> 01:11.579
I know, I know, no giving up
our day job just yet.

01:11.581 --> 01:13.147
It could be a year before the shop

01:13.149 --> 01:14.584
is profitable enough to pay for itself.

01:14.586 --> 01:16.420
Six months, tops.

01:16.422 --> 01:19.892
Look, I know that I've been
a little flaky in the past.

01:19.894 --> 01:21.093
A little?

01:21.095 --> 01:23.028
You never met a job you couldn't quit.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.663
This is different.

01:24.665 --> 01:28.302
This is ours.

01:28.304 --> 01:30.070
Owning our own business

01:30.072 --> 01:32.906
with my best friend since third grade.

01:32.908 --> 01:35.108
Being our own bosses?

01:35.110 --> 01:36.777
Mm-hmm.

01:38.013 --> 01:39.579
I knew it!

01:39.581 --> 01:40.881
Ohh.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.351
Ow! Ooh!

01:44.353 --> 01:45.719
Are you okay?

01:45.721 --> 01:49.224
I must've just cut my finger
on the wire basket.

01:50.727 --> 01:51.760
Okay.

01:51.762 --> 01:53.430
Ooh!

01:53.432 --> 01:54.431
You got it?

01:54.433 --> 01:56.299
Mm-hmm.

01:58.971 --> 02:02.174
To fresh starts.

02:02.176 --> 02:04.844
I never needed one more.

02:22.062 --> 02:24.297
- Good morning.
- Eh.

02:24.299 --> 02:26.165
You're up early.

02:26.167 --> 02:28.201
Hank, I'm just gonna say it.

02:28.203 --> 02:30.470
Sleeping on the couch?

02:30.472 --> 02:32.372
What's the word? Oh, yeah.

02:32.374 --> 02:33.507
Blows.

02:33.509 --> 02:36.144
And that's why we're taking turns.

02:36.146 --> 02:37.412
But, seriously, Ev,

02:37.414 --> 02:39.214
you don't have to wash
the sheets every day.

02:39.216 --> 02:41.217
Come on, what are we, savages?

02:42.454 --> 02:44.054
Wow, that answers my question.

02:44.056 --> 02:46.290
We're good friends
and good hosts, you know?

02:46.292 --> 02:48.726
The kind who don't let guests
sleep on sofas.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.561
A good guest doesn't hog my bathroom

02:50.563 --> 02:52.330
for two hours every morning.

02:52.332 --> 02:53.865
Like, what is she doing up there?

02:53.867 --> 02:55.700
Don't know, don't care,
and neither should you.

02:55.702 --> 02:58.369
I know Divya's going
through a hard time, okay?

02:58.371 --> 03:00.371
I get it, I do. And I'm sorry, but...

03:00.373 --> 03:01.839
Okay, okay. Just be nice.

03:01.841 --> 03:03.541
Good morning, gorgeous.

03:03.543 --> 03:04.942
I said be nice, not creepy.

03:04.944 --> 03:06.110
Morning, Divya.

03:06.112 --> 03:07.545
I've overstayed my welcome.

03:07.547 --> 03:08.880
No, you have not.

03:08.882 --> 03:10.549
What? Wait a minute,
you've been staying here?

03:10.551 --> 03:12.985
You two are terrible liars,

03:12.987 --> 03:14.621
but very good friends,

03:14.623 --> 03:16.356
which is why you'll be happy to know

03:16.358 --> 03:18.024
that I've found a place to live,

03:18.026 --> 03:19.493
and I can move in this weekend.

03:19.495 --> 03:20.761
That's great.

03:20.763 --> 03:22.195
- That's so great.
- That is so cool.

03:22.197 --> 03:23.197
Okay, okay, get off!

03:23.199 --> 03:24.631
What?

03:24.633 --> 03:26.601
- You smell.
- Yeah. Go take a shower.

03:26.603 --> 03:27.669
Done, and done.

03:27.671 --> 03:29.704
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

03:29.706 --> 03:31.606
Oh.

03:31.608 --> 03:34.843
Uh, Divya, though
I appreciate the gesture,

03:34.845 --> 03:37.579
this is where I draw the line, okay?

03:37.581 --> 03:38.580
Sorry about that.

03:38.582 --> 03:40.148
Okay.

03:40.150 --> 03:41.783
Oh, oh.

03:41.785 --> 03:45.086
I want to make you guys
a thank-you dinner tonight.

03:45.088 --> 03:47.289
- Sounds great.
- That's awesome, Divya.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.124
Such a good idea.

03:49.126 --> 03:51.361
What if she cooks Indian food?

03:51.363 --> 03:52.996
Okay, so if she were from Italy,

03:52.998 --> 03:54.397
would you assume she'd cook Italian?

03:54.399 --> 03:55.765
Yes, and that would be awesome,

03:55.767 --> 03:56.867
'cause I love Italian food.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.068
Whatever she makes, you will eat it,

03:58.070 --> 04:00.437
and you will like it.

04:00.439 --> 04:02.572
- Morning.
- Hi.

04:02.574 --> 04:04.407
Dieter gave this to me on the way in,

04:04.409 --> 04:06.142
asked me to deliver it.

04:06.144 --> 04:08.746
Oh, yeah, that must be
the mail from the winter, so...

04:08.748 --> 04:11.816
Must've piled up
while we were at Newberg's.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.618
Discard, discard, discard.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.686
Some checks.
That's good.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.288
Keep those.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.923
Discard, discard.
Good. We're done.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.459
Ev, that's a box of our mail.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.027
What? I got
the payment envelopes.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.762
Everything else is mostly just junk mail.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.830
Well, "mostly" isn't "all".

04:24.832 --> 04:25.831
Please go through that today.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.566
- Hey, Hank?
- Yeah?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.667
Jill just called. We need to go.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.801
Oh, okay. See you guys.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.606
You know what, I'll help.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.741
I can make it fun.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.243
Not even you can make mail sorting fun.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.779
Want to bet?

04:48.219 --> 04:50.020
Hank and Divya, this is Stella.

04:50.022 --> 04:51.488
Thanks for coming.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.924
Um, Kate's in the back. Hurry.

04:56.494 --> 04:57.561
Hi.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.462
I told Kate to hire a handyman.

04:59.464 --> 05:00.730
It was a simple shelf.

05:00.732 --> 05:02.232
I'd put nine of them together before.

05:02.234 --> 05:03.500
This one just slipped.

05:03.502 --> 05:04.834
Yeah, and she refused to go to urgent care.

05:04.836 --> 05:07.404
'Cause they charged $500 bucks
when you cut your thumb.

05:07.406 --> 05:08.605
To pull out a power tool?

05:08.607 --> 05:09.639
Please. I would need a loan.

05:09.641 --> 05:10.840
Is it in the floor?

05:10.842 --> 05:12.108
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.510
Can you please get me the drill?

05:14.512 --> 05:17.279
I need to numb your foot
before I remove the drill bit.

05:17.281 --> 05:18.380
Okay.

05:18.382 --> 05:20.149
You're gonna feel a little pinch.

05:20.151 --> 05:21.383
Mmm.

05:21.385 --> 05:23.752
Okay, drill, please.

05:23.754 --> 05:25.154
Thank you.

05:25.156 --> 05:27.722
I want to cause as little
soft tissue trauma as possible,

05:27.724 --> 05:29.692
so I'm gonna back the drill-bit out.

05:29.694 --> 05:31.594
Wait, you're gonna use
the drill to remove it?

05:31.596 --> 05:32.762
Mm-hmm.

05:32.764 --> 05:34.364
Okay, you're making me really nervous.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.309
Stella, why don't you show Jill your shop?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.834
I'd love to see your shop.

05:37.836 --> 05:41.239
Kate will be fine. Promise.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.707
All right.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.143
Okay.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.948
Wait. You're sure you're a doctor, right?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.383
Don't worry.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.619
This won't take long,
and you won't feel a thing.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.522
- I am so finding a handyman.
- Yeah.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.057
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

06:00.059 --> 06:01.625
do you know if the cute doctor is single?

06:01.627 --> 06:03.327
I think he has a girlfriend.

06:03.329 --> 06:06.430
- All the good ones do.
- Yeah.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.399
It was just a puncture wound.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.801
Hank is giving her a tetanus shot now.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.737
She'll be fine.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.774
Sorry.

06:14.776 --> 06:17.777
Hmm. Maybe Kate's not the only
one who needed a doctor.

06:17.779 --> 06:19.713
How long have you had your cough?

06:19.715 --> 06:21.748
Uh, a few days.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.318
We've been working two jobs
since we signed the lease.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.486
I'm just a little under the weather.

06:26.488 --> 06:27.621
Seriously.

06:27.623 --> 06:29.290
Here's our card, okay?

06:29.292 --> 06:31.459
Please call us if your symptoms get worse.

06:31.461 --> 06:34.296
And no $500 charges, either.

06:34.298 --> 06:35.430
Seriously.

06:35.432 --> 06:37.432
All right, take care.

Hi.

07:27.676 --> 07:29.209
All right, today's schedule.

07:29.211 --> 07:30.444
Thank you.

07:30.446 --> 07:31.912
Wow. You guys are busy.

07:31.914 --> 07:34.315
- And you smell like...
- Tuberose.

07:34.317 --> 07:36.150
I snagged some samples.

07:36.152 --> 07:37.384
We'll need to split up

07:37.386 --> 07:38.652
if we're gonna see all these patients.

07:38.654 --> 07:41.254
Yes. Which means
our only break will be now,

07:41.256 --> 07:42.622
so shall we grab a coffee?

07:42.624 --> 07:44.857
Actually, Hank,
there's a new clinic patient

07:44.859 --> 07:46.492
that I was hoping you might see.

07:46.494 --> 07:47.660
Won't take long.

07:47.662 --> 07:48.894
Of course. Caffeine can wait.

07:48.896 --> 07:50.529
Uh, Divya, I can handle this.

07:50.531 --> 07:51.630
You go grab some coffee,

07:51.632 --> 07:53.032
and I'll catch up with you later.

07:53.034 --> 07:54.033
Are you sure?

07:54.035 --> 07:55.401
Oh. I'm so sure.

07:55.403 --> 07:57.402
All right. Okay.

07:57.404 --> 08:00.138
There is no clinic patient.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.239
I know.

08:01.241 --> 08:03.108
- My place?
- Mine's closer.

08:03.110 --> 08:04.109
Okay.

08:12.585 --> 08:14.887
As I was bending over, I slipped,

08:14.889 --> 08:16.922
and my husband insisted I see a doctor.

08:16.924 --> 08:19.458
But I generally find doctors
rude, Dr. Lawson.

08:19.460 --> 08:22.528
Your heroism at the Jitney crash
was both impressive

08:22.530 --> 08:24.663
and appealed to my sense
of common decency.

08:24.665 --> 08:26.866
Yes, I can see that good manners

08:26.868 --> 08:28.134
are very important to you.

08:28.136 --> 08:29.736
They ought to be to everybody.

08:29.738 --> 08:32.506
Particularly the ruffians, of course.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.275
Of course.

08:34.277 --> 08:35.543
Okay.

08:35.544 --> 08:37.943
Yeah, nothing's broken.

08:37.946 --> 08:40.647
But on a scale of one to ten,

08:40.649 --> 08:41.948
what's your pain level?

08:41.950 --> 08:44.250
Oh. A rather rude seven.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.885
But only on the right.

08:45.887 --> 08:47.720
Yeah, the joint capsule
doesn't move as freely

08:47.722 --> 08:49.154
as the one on the left.

08:49.156 --> 08:51.223
I'll prescribe
some anti-inflammatories

08:51.225 --> 08:52.524
and give you a sling,

08:52.526 --> 08:53.959
and I'll be back tomorrow
to take an X-ray.

08:53.961 --> 08:55.360
Why, if nothing's broken?

08:55.362 --> 08:56.428
I want to make sure you don't have

08:56.430 --> 08:59.064
a non-displaced shoulder fracture.

08:59.066 --> 09:00.366
Evelyn?

09:00.368 --> 09:02.101
That would be my husband Charles.

09:02.103 --> 09:05.137
The neighbor is back, and he's at it again.

09:05.139 --> 09:06.239
Uh, Charles.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.507
Charles?

09:07.509 --> 09:09.676
I want you to meet Dr. Hank Lawson.

09:09.678 --> 09:11.745
Mr. Woodward, it's good to meet you.

09:11.747 --> 09:13.347
The pleasure is all mine.

09:13.349 --> 09:15.616
Thank you for responding
to Evelyn's call so quickly.

09:15.618 --> 09:16.683
Yeah, sure.

09:16.685 --> 09:20.720
Um, excuse me, Dr. Lawson.

09:23.923 --> 09:26.024
Mr. Douglass.

09:27.894 --> 09:29.494
Mr. Douglass!

09:29.496 --> 09:31.296
Mr. Woodward!

09:31.298 --> 09:34.165
Yeah, uh, Mr. Douglass,
for the 1 millionth time,

09:34.167 --> 09:37.268
I am asking you,
please pick up after your dog.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.704
I'm ignoring you for a reason,
Mr. Woodward.

09:39.706 --> 09:42.641
Your yelling is ruining my dog's walk!

09:42.643 --> 09:45.912
And your dog is ruining my lawn!

09:47.181 --> 09:48.281
What in the world are you doing?

09:48.283 --> 09:50.818
What he's making me do.

10:04.566 --> 10:05.566
Get if off.

10:05.568 --> 10:06.600
Get it off!

10:06.602 --> 10:07.801
All right, all right, calm down.

10:07.803 --> 10:10.470
It's only compost.
There you go.

10:10.472 --> 10:11.971
There you go.

10:14.774 --> 10:18.844
Maybe this'll teach you
to stay in your own backyard.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.947
Friend of Mr. Woodward?

10:20.949 --> 10:22.815
Only met him today.

10:22.817 --> 10:24.384
Okay.

10:24.386 --> 10:26.653
Good. Yep.

10:26.655 --> 10:27.954
Look up, please.

10:27.956 --> 10:30.024
I can see why he would call a doctor.

10:30.026 --> 10:31.425
That man is sick.

10:31.427 --> 10:33.361
Okay, open up.

10:33.363 --> 10:35.196
You know, you pushed me to the limit

10:35.198 --> 10:37.065
when my wife fell and hurt her shoulder

10:37.067 --> 10:39.300
cleaning up after your mutt!

10:39.302 --> 10:41.736
Cleopatra is a purebred with papers!

10:41.738 --> 10:44.572
A four-time runner-up
of the Westminster Kennel Club.

10:44.574 --> 10:46.240
She's been on <i>Oprah.</i>

10:46.242 --> 10:47.708
Okay, okay, um...

10:47.710 --> 10:49.543
so, look, your eyes are clear,

10:49.545 --> 10:50.678
ear canals are clean,

10:50.680 --> 10:52.346
and your nose and mouth look normal.

10:52.348 --> 10:54.081
I'd say you're fine, but here's my card.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.982
Call if you have problems later.

10:55.984 --> 10:57.984
Later? What do I do now?

10:57.986 --> 11:00.153
As a doctor, I'd advise a long, hot shower.

11:00.155 --> 11:02.955
As a human being, I'd advise
picking up after your dog.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.233
Yo!

11:15.235 --> 11:16.935
Henry!

11:18.971 --> 11:20.972
Henrietta?

11:48.201 --> 11:50.536
Hello, Mr. Postman.

11:50.538 --> 11:52.905
Hi.

11:52.907 --> 11:54.940
So I'm the postman,

11:54.942 --> 11:56.576
all right, what does that make you?

11:56.578 --> 11:57.877
Are you the mail?

11:57.879 --> 11:59.179
Are you a dog?

11:59.181 --> 12:00.213
Am I trying to open you?

12:00.215 --> 12:02.082
Are you running after me? Am I...

12:02.084 --> 12:03.717
just tell me what to do.
What do I do?

12:03.719 --> 12:06.954
For every stack of mail you go through,

12:06.956 --> 12:10.023
I will grant you a wish.

12:12.027 --> 12:14.461
Discard, discard.

12:14.463 --> 12:15.463
Keep.

12:15.465 --> 12:17.098
Wow. You respond well
to bribery.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.332
Yeah, Hank was the good son.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.134
Me... not so much.

12:20.136 --> 12:22.703
My mom actually used to bribe me
to do chores and homework

12:22.705 --> 12:24.204
with Zwix Sticky Stix.

12:24.206 --> 12:26.440
This is, uh, a lot better, by the way.

12:26.442 --> 12:27.874
Zwix-sticky-what-now?

12:27.876 --> 12:29.209
You've never heard of Zwix Sticky Stix?

12:29.211 --> 12:30.543
- No.
- Oh, my God.

12:30.545 --> 12:32.578
Zwix Sticky Stix... the best candy ever.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.380
When they stopped makin' em,
I cried for, like, a week.

12:34.382 --> 12:35.414
It was horrible.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.283
Discard, discard.

12:37.285 --> 12:38.951
Oh, my God.

12:40.622 --> 12:42.222
U.S. Department of Justice.

12:42.224 --> 12:44.158
Oh, that must be about your dad.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.693
You open it.

12:45.695 --> 12:46.894
I can... I can't.

12:55.506 --> 12:58.374
"This letter is to inform you
that Edward R. Lawson"

12:58.376 --> 13:01.244
"has become eligible for parole on Monday".

13:01.246 --> 13:03.747
Parole? Wait, this Monday?

13:03.749 --> 13:05.182
Yeah.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.683
"Any communication with respect"

13:06.685 --> 13:07.984
"to the aforesaid hearing"

13:07.986 --> 13:10.020
"should be addressed
to the parole commission"

13:10.022 --> 13:13.090
"and must be received within 15 days of..."

13:13.092 --> 13:14.659
Of when?

13:14.661 --> 13:15.793
What's the date on the letter?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.896
February 1st.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.565
You missed the window by four months.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.268
Is there a number on there or something?

13:22.270 --> 13:24.003
Uh, no.

13:24.005 --> 13:26.206
No name, no number, nothing.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.842
There's gotta be a number.

13:28.844 --> 13:31.512
Great. So we're not gonna able
to support my dad

13:31.514 --> 13:32.781
at his parole hearing.

13:32.783 --> 13:34.716
Maybe they'll bend the rules.

13:34.718 --> 13:38.419
Yeah. The Department
of Justice is known for that.

14:16.993 --> 14:18.059
Almost done?

14:18.061 --> 14:19.960
Almost done.

14:24.499 --> 14:26.099
Oh, my God.

14:26.101 --> 14:28.568
Oh, my God.

14:30.771 --> 14:33.939
Well, this isn't good.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.107
We talk to dad every week.

14:35.109 --> 14:36.475
He's never mentioned parole, ever.

14:36.477 --> 14:37.909
Why?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.411
Well, when we talk to him tomorrow,

14:39.413 --> 14:40.445
we'll bring it up.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.580
We'll see if we can do anything

14:41.582 --> 14:42.915
or if his lawyer can.

14:42.917 --> 14:44.116
We'll... we'll figure something out.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.119
- Mmm!
- Hi.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.288
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:48.290 --> 14:51.558
I have made food for a feast.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.893
First entree...

14:52.895 --> 14:54.261
lamb vindaloo.

14:54.263 --> 14:56.030
Ooh! Sounds Indian.

14:58.467 --> 15:01.235
Ah, looks Indian, too.

15:03.672 --> 15:06.473
- Gosh, it smells...
- Amazing.

15:06.475 --> 15:07.774
- Thank you, Hank.
- Sure.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.411
It is my great-grandmother's
favorite recipe.

15:11.413 --> 15:12.712
Oh.

15:12.714 --> 15:14.280
Please.

15:14.282 --> 15:15.715
Enjoy, enjoy.

15:15.717 --> 15:17.116
Okay.

15:20.355 --> 15:22.388
Ohh.

15:22.390 --> 15:24.257
- Gosh.
- Right.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.129
Mmm.

15:30.131 --> 15:31.264
It's great.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.499
- Yeah?
- Fantastic, Divya.

15:32.501 --> 15:33.633
It's really good.

15:33.635 --> 15:35.668
Okay. Great.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.438
It's not too spicy?
You'd tell me, right?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.940
No, no, it is perfect.

15:39.942 --> 15:41.042
Perfect.

15:41.044 --> 15:43.077
Oh. I almost forgot the chutneys.

15:43.079 --> 15:45.046
Be back.

15:45.048 --> 15:46.180
Oh, my God.

15:46.182 --> 15:47.482
It's like I ate lava. It...

15:47.484 --> 15:49.117
Mmm!

15:49.119 --> 15:51.086
Just swallow, don't chew.

15:51.088 --> 15:54.757
- Swallow, don't chew.
- Hello? Uh, Hank?

15:54.759 --> 15:56.092
Stella.

15:59.996 --> 16:01.096
Are you okay?

16:01.098 --> 16:02.164
I don't think so.

16:11.518 --> 16:13.552
If you're allergic to any component,

16:13.554 --> 16:16.320
we'll see a raised red lesion
under that patch.

16:16.322 --> 16:17.854
I don't understand.
I created our products

16:17.856 --> 16:19.956
- with all-natural ingredients.
- And you've never had

16:19.958 --> 16:21.858
an allergic reaction to any of them?

16:21.860 --> 16:23.893
I had never had an allergic
reaction to anything.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.494
Do you manufacture your products as well?

16:25.496 --> 16:27.029
No, my kitchen's not big enough anymore.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.463
We have a supplier now.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.032
Okay. Well, could they have somehow

16:30.034 --> 16:31.600
deviated from your recipes?

16:31.602 --> 16:33.701
Oh, my God, I really hope not.

16:33.703 --> 16:36.438
We have been leaving samples
in houses all over the Hamptons.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.073
If they turn out to be toxic...

16:38.075 --> 16:40.842
Let's not jump to conclusions, okay?

16:40.844 --> 16:42.778
Let's see the rash.

16:42.780 --> 16:46.048
Okay, does... does any of this hurt?

16:46.050 --> 16:47.516
No.

16:47.518 --> 16:49.251
All right, it's probably
just a viral exanthem...

16:49.253 --> 16:51.419
a skin rash brought on by the flu.

16:51.421 --> 16:53.021
- You have had that cough.
- Yeah.

16:53.023 --> 16:54.389
Yeah, but it's not getting any worse.

16:54.391 --> 16:55.790
Still, it could be viral.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.626
Okay, well, I really hope that's all it is.

16:57.628 --> 17:00.195
We have a lot riding
on this shop, especially Kate.

17:00.197 --> 17:01.830
You know, all I'm risking is the latest

17:01.832 --> 17:03.231
in a string of dead end jobs.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.799
But Kate, she gave up a job with benefits

17:04.800 --> 17:06.666
to go into the cleaning
business with me, for me.

17:06.669 --> 17:08.702
Um, I talk a lot when I'm nervous.

17:08.704 --> 17:09.903
Perfectly okay.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.704
Thank you.

17:11.707 --> 17:14.741
It took me a long time to figure
out what I wanted to do.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.209
And now you found your dream job,

17:16.211 --> 17:18.077
and you don't want to lose it.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.579
Or lose Kate.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.481
You know, she's... she's the only person

17:22.483 --> 17:24.950
that's always been there for me.

17:24.952 --> 17:27.286
You know, she's my best friend.

17:27.288 --> 17:28.520
She's a big sister.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.190
She's my overprotective
best friend big sister.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.392
Wow. I'm just really nervous.

17:36.062 --> 17:38.129
I just can't let her down.

17:38.131 --> 17:39.664
You know, I won't.

17:39.666 --> 17:42.400
She's been through way too much already.

17:42.402 --> 17:48.338
Um, about a year ago,
her husband was killed, so...

17:48.340 --> 17:51.240
You know, if anyone...

17:51.242 --> 17:54.676
if anyone deserves a break, it's Kate.

17:54.678 --> 17:56.478
All right, let's see how you did.

18:04.688 --> 18:06.755
Okay.

18:06.757 --> 18:10.426
Well, looks like you're
both getting a break.

18:10.428 --> 18:13.462
Preliminary results to
the patch test are negative.

18:15.798 --> 18:18.366
Okay, so it's not our products?

18:18.368 --> 18:20.769
No, but you're still
experiencing viral symptoms.

18:20.771 --> 18:25.739
So if the rash goes
outside of this circle...

18:25.741 --> 18:26.740
Uh-huh.

18:26.742 --> 18:29.042
I want you to call me immediately.

18:30.644 --> 18:31.878
That's it?

18:31.880 --> 18:34.580
- That is it.
- Great.

18:34.582 --> 18:37.149
And please rest and stay hydrated

18:37.151 --> 18:38.317
until your flu goes away.

18:38.319 --> 18:41.721
I feel better already. Thank you.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.334
Just as I'd hoped.

18:53.336 --> 18:54.802
- No fracture.
- Oh.

18:54.804 --> 18:58.104
But there is still
a decreased range of motion.

18:58.106 --> 19:00.373
You're definitely stiffer
than you were yesterday.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.042
I'm tense, all right, thanks to Charles.

19:02.044 --> 19:04.578
Is he in the manners business also?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.313
I'm afraid there's not enough money

19:06.315 --> 19:07.680
in the manners business for Charles.

19:07.682 --> 19:09.182
He's a venture capitalist.

19:09.184 --> 19:11.684
Loves to get in on the ground
floor of small businesses...

19:11.686 --> 19:13.286
Like yours, come to think of it.

19:13.288 --> 19:15.088
Hmm.

19:15.090 --> 19:17.423
Darling, before you walk
that letter down the street,

19:17.425 --> 19:18.791
I'd love to hear it.

19:18.793 --> 19:21.561
"Dear Mr. Douglass",

19:21.563 --> 19:25.131
"I deeply regret my un-neighborly actions"

19:25.133 --> 19:26.832
"which resulted from
the fact that you violated"

19:26.834 --> 19:27.933
"not just common civility",

19:27.935 --> 19:30.369
"but 150-dash-5 of the Southampton..."

19:30.371 --> 19:31.671
Stop right there.

19:31.673 --> 19:34.006
In a real apology, one
doesn't make excuses.

19:34.008 --> 19:35.141
Don't worry, darling.

19:35.143 --> 19:38.978
In the real one, I'm perfectly contrite.

19:38.980 --> 19:40.547
Oh.

19:40.549 --> 19:41.982
I thought we should apologize in person,

19:41.984 --> 19:43.850
so we walked over
to his house this morning,

19:43.852 --> 19:45.886
but Mr. Douglass didn't answer.

19:45.888 --> 19:47.487
I suspect he was home.

19:47.489 --> 19:50.023
His dog was barking, his car
was parked in the driveway.

19:50.025 --> 19:51.525
Well, if it'll make you feel better,

19:51.527 --> 19:53.126
I can stop by, check things out.

19:53.128 --> 19:55.328
Your parents raised you well.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.697
Now, before I go, I want to
show you some exercises

19:57.699 --> 19:59.566
that'll help unlock your shoulder.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.367
First, lift your arm up...

20:01.369 --> 20:03.202
- Oh.
- I know, I know.

20:03.204 --> 20:05.604
Up and down above your head just like that.

20:05.606 --> 20:08.240
All right. Good.

20:08.242 --> 20:10.675
Uh, Ms. Woodward?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.377
Your jugular vein.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.080
Every time you inhale, it enlarges.

20:15.082 --> 20:16.481
- Oh.
- One sec.

20:20.421 --> 20:21.921
Breathe for me, please.

20:25.693 --> 20:29.497
Lean forward, please, and twist.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.699
Okay, any chest pain?

20:31.701 --> 20:35.069
Well, there was, actually,

20:35.071 --> 20:36.738
but it went away after my fall.

20:36.740 --> 20:39.340
I think the anti-inflammatories

20:39.342 --> 20:42.944
I gave you for your shoulder
may be masking other symptoms.

20:42.946 --> 20:44.145
Of what?

20:44.147 --> 20:47.682
Mrs. Woodward, do you have a cardiologist?

20:50.285 --> 20:52.153
Inmate locator, press one.

20:52.155 --> 20:55.624
Inmate matters, press two.

20:55.626 --> 20:57.459
Yeah, hi, this is Evan R. Lawson again.

20:57.461 --> 20:59.695
Uh, I have left five mess... seven.

20:59.697 --> 21:00.997
Seven messages for you guys

21:00.999 --> 21:02.899
in regards to my father, Edward R. Lawson,

21:02.901 --> 21:05.735
so I don't know,
maybe you could call me back,

21:05.737 --> 21:07.170
'cause that's your job.

21:07.172 --> 21:10.607
Your job... you're not running
a video store.

21:10.609 --> 21:11.875
I just want to help my dad.

21:11.877 --> 21:13.544
I know, babe.

21:14.714 --> 21:16.780
This is Evan.

21:16.782 --> 21:18.616
Yeah, Paige is right here.
Who is this?

21:18.618 --> 21:20.083
- Wait a minute.
- Hi. This is Paige.

21:20.085 --> 21:21.384
Oh.

21:21.386 --> 21:23.786
Uh, yes.

21:23.788 --> 21:25.121
Not really.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.691
Can I call you back?

21:28.693 --> 21:30.259
Okay, thanks.

21:34.964 --> 21:36.264
Something wrong?

21:36.266 --> 21:38.467
Other than the fact
that you answered my phone?

21:38.469 --> 21:39.468
Nope.

21:39.470 --> 21:42.938
I'm sorry.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.540
What? I'm sorry. It was an accident.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.843
Accident? Is your phone pink?

21:46.845 --> 21:48.812
What?

21:48.814 --> 21:51.181
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

21:51.183 --> 21:55.119
- Great.
- Okay.

21:55.121 --> 21:58.422
So I called over a dozen numbers

21:58.424 --> 21:59.522
at the Department of Corrections.

21:59.524 --> 22:00.690
I can't get a hold of anybody.

22:00.692 --> 22:01.791
Ev, relax.

22:01.793 --> 22:03.092
We'll talk to dad later today,

22:03.094 --> 22:04.760
and we'll find out what's going on then.

22:04.762 --> 22:06.095
Thank you.

22:06.097 --> 22:07.897
I said the same thing to him
over an hour ago.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.233
Okay,

22:11.235 --> 22:12.935
this hot tub is way too stressful for me.

22:17.274 --> 22:20.342
- Have fun.
- O... kay.

22:22.346 --> 22:25.716
So, um, how are things?

22:25.718 --> 22:28.819
He's just really stressed about your dad.

22:28.821 --> 22:32.190
Yeah. No, um, I meant with you.

22:32.192 --> 22:33.691
Oh. Oh, I'm fine, too.

22:33.693 --> 22:35.560
Yeah.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.529
Good. Good.

22:37.531 --> 22:40.032
But, um, I've been thinking

22:40.034 --> 22:41.900
about our conversation the other day,

22:41.902 --> 22:47.338
and, uh, I made a list
of internists in the area.

22:47.340 --> 22:49.073
Mm-hmm.

22:49.075 --> 22:50.474
Maybe one of them can help you

22:50.476 --> 22:52.643
with, you know, whatever
it is you're dealing with.

22:52.645 --> 22:54.778
You misunderstood.

22:56.147 --> 22:58.249
And I am late for a family thing,

22:58.251 --> 23:00.451
so if you could just tell Evan that I left,

23:00.453 --> 23:03.187
that would be great.

23:03.189 --> 23:04.922
And, Hank?

23:04.924 --> 23:07.225
We don't ever need
to talk about this again.

23:16.136 --> 23:18.238
Stop it.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.245
You're fine.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.817
Stella! Two-minute warning!

23:32.488 --> 23:35.190
You forgot the towels!

23:41.930 --> 23:44.265
Stella?

23:44.267 --> 23:45.799
What are you doing?

23:45.801 --> 23:47.968
Oh, my God.

23:49.870 --> 23:50.970
Oh, my God.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.739
Stella?

23:53.942 --> 23:55.508
No.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.344
Please don't touch me.

23:58.346 --> 23:59.312
Please don't touch me.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.381
What is it? What's wrong?

24:01.383 --> 24:03.751
My skin is on fire.

24:11.842 --> 24:15.378
Okay, we're gonna take
a small skin sample

24:15.380 --> 24:17.480
with this punch biopsy tool.

24:32.397 --> 24:34.697
And now, I'm gonna seal all skin bleeders

24:34.699 --> 24:36.065
with this electric cautery.

24:39.136 --> 24:41.270
Okay, that's it.

24:44.741 --> 24:47.944
Why didn't you tell me
that you saw Hank yesterday?

24:47.946 --> 24:51.147
I just didn't want you
to think that I was flaking.

24:51.149 --> 24:53.883
It's not flaking if you're sick.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.155
What's wrong with me?

24:59.157 --> 25:01.624
We'll find out. I promise.

25:01.626 --> 25:04.226
So what happens now?

25:04.228 --> 25:07.128
The punch biopsy will test
for several skin diseases.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.331
I'd also like to schedule
an MRI and an EEG.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.999
In the meantime, Stella, I want you home,

25:12.001 --> 25:13.534
resting.

25:13.536 --> 25:14.568
I'll make sure of it.

25:14.570 --> 25:15.936
Good. I'll see you guys out.

25:15.938 --> 25:17.404
I will call Jill

25:17.406 --> 25:19.106
and see if I can get
a rush on these samples.

25:19.108 --> 25:20.540
Great.

25:42.797 --> 25:45.065
Jill? Shall I call you on your cell,

25:45.067 --> 25:48.168
or can you hear me just fine like this?

25:48.170 --> 25:50.471
Hi!

25:50.473 --> 25:53.240
Uh... I'll, uh...

25:53.242 --> 25:55.409
put a rush on those samples.

25:55.411 --> 25:57.277
Thank you.

25:57.279 --> 25:59.446
How did you know I was here?

25:59.448 --> 26:01.448
The air smells like tuberose,

26:01.450 --> 26:03.216
your purse is right there,

26:03.218 --> 26:06.552
and, uh, Evan recently gave me

26:06.554 --> 26:09.421
something that I believe belongs to you.

26:12.058 --> 26:14.960
So many questions.

26:14.962 --> 26:15.961
Indeed.

26:15.963 --> 26:17.197
Okay.

26:17.199 --> 26:19.799
Hey.

26:19.801 --> 26:22.169
It is none of my business,

26:22.171 --> 26:25.206
but what is with
all of the sneaking around?

26:25.208 --> 26:29.445
Look, last summer, Hank didn't know

26:29.447 --> 26:31.113
if he wanted to stay in the Hamptons,

26:31.115 --> 26:36.352
and this summer, I don't know
how long I'll be here, so...

26:36.354 --> 26:38.621
I guess it's just easier this way.

26:38.623 --> 26:40.022
How is this easier?

26:40.024 --> 26:42.758
Because we don't
have to explain it to anyone.

27:01.345 --> 27:02.746
Psst!

27:04.883 --> 27:07.318
Get in.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.519
Quick.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.292
Sorry I missed dad's call.

27:14.294 --> 27:15.960
I got hung up with patients.

27:18.864 --> 27:21.665
Is there a reason you're sitting
in the driveway?

27:21.667 --> 27:24.134
It's eat now or suffer later.

27:24.136 --> 27:25.535
Divya's cooking again.

27:25.537 --> 27:27.103
Okay, okay.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.038
It's okay. We're gonna be fine.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.140
Uh, we need yogurt, lots of it.

27:31.142 --> 27:33.509
Yogurt cools down a spicy mouth.

27:34.846 --> 27:36.712
What?

27:36.714 --> 27:38.848
You really think tossing a yo-plait

27:38.850 --> 27:40.850
onto Mount Vesuvius is gonna work?

27:40.852 --> 27:42.518
Give me the grease.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.620
That-a-boy.

27:48.592 --> 27:51.059
So, what'd dad say?

27:51.061 --> 27:53.461
Mm.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.929
He's got the hearing covered.

27:54.931 --> 27:56.964
It's a formality.
He doesn't want us to attend.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.233
He said that's why he's never mentioned it.

27:59.235 --> 28:00.334
Then we won't go.

28:00.336 --> 28:02.536
No, he wants us there.

28:02.538 --> 28:04.104
I thought he didn't want us there.

28:04.106 --> 28:06.606
You're just not reading between the lines.

28:06.608 --> 28:08.908
I didn't realize there were lines.

28:08.910 --> 28:11.511
He doesn't want to come off as desperate.

28:11.513 --> 28:13.546
May I remind you the man is in prison?

28:13.548 --> 28:18.418
Look, Henry, we will barely be gone, okay?

28:18.420 --> 28:20.554
It's a long weekend at most.

28:20.556 --> 28:22.323
Divya will be here
to take care of our clients.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.958
As long as she doesn't cook for them,

28:23.960 --> 28:25.293
I think everything will be fine.

28:25.295 --> 28:28.130
Again, if dad says he's got it covered,

28:28.132 --> 28:29.732
then he's probably got it covered.

28:29.734 --> 28:31.567
Whoa.

28:31.569 --> 28:34.103
You're taking dad's word over mine?

28:34.105 --> 28:36.005
Why do you always have
to second-guess people?

28:36.007 --> 28:38.174
I mean, most people
just say what they mean.

28:38.176 --> 28:39.609
Even our dad.

28:39.611 --> 28:42.445
Yeah, these days, even dad.

28:42.447 --> 28:45.881
Oh, so when you say that you
and Jill are broken up,

28:45.883 --> 28:47.716
I should believe what you're saying,

28:47.718 --> 28:49.984
even though I know for a fact
you guys are still hooking up,

28:49.986 --> 28:51.085
like, every night?

28:51.087 --> 28:55.156
Oh. Oh.

28:55.158 --> 28:56.991
By the way, would you please tell Jill

28:56.993 --> 28:58.226
to put the toilet seat back up

28:58.228 --> 28:59.461
when she's done in the bathroom?

28:59.463 --> 29:00.762
A little respect would be awesome.

29:00.764 --> 29:02.531
Yeah, sure.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.765
Thank you.

29:16.681 --> 29:19.082
You have to know by now
I'm gonna keep coming back

29:19.084 --> 29:21.886
until you answer!

29:21.888 --> 29:24.422
C'mon, Jerry, I just want
to see how you're doing!

29:24.424 --> 29:25.790
I'm fine.

29:25.792 --> 29:29.561
Now, leave.

29:29.563 --> 29:32.331
Wait. You were there.

29:34.768 --> 29:36.135
And what is this?

29:36.137 --> 29:38.805
An affidavit of my injuries.

29:38.807 --> 29:40.106
You're gonna sue the Woodwards?

29:40.108 --> 29:41.507
For every dime they've got,

29:41.509 --> 29:44.444
and you'll be able to testify
as an expert witness.

29:44.446 --> 29:46.179
Okay, what's happened to your eyes?

29:46.181 --> 29:49.582
It's either E. Coli, listeriosis,
or mad cow disease.

29:49.584 --> 29:52.184
I've been scrubbing my face
every hour, but it's too late.

29:52.186 --> 29:53.318
I, uh...

29:53.320 --> 29:54.986
I have something.

29:54.988 --> 29:57.856
What you have is a reaction
to excessive face washing.

29:57.858 --> 30:01.025
Yeah? Well, what about this?

30:01.027 --> 30:02.860
Okay, now that's something.

30:02.862 --> 30:06.263
Are you sure you haven't been
exposed to anything else?

30:06.265 --> 30:07.631
Other than compost?

30:07.633 --> 30:09.332
Soap, water,

30:09.334 --> 30:11.868
- a little clorox.
- Wait. Bleach?

30:11.870 --> 30:14.570
A blogger online thought it
might wash the smell off my skin

30:14.572 --> 30:17.205
and get rid of whatever
I'm allergic to in the compost.

30:17.207 --> 30:19.341
Look, I'm not an idiot.

30:19.343 --> 30:21.209
I didn't bathe in the bleach,

30:21.211 --> 30:22.677
and I diluted it with water.

30:22.679 --> 30:25.546
Any bleach on the skin can
cause a chemical burn.

30:25.548 --> 30:26.980
Are you sure that's what this is?

30:26.982 --> 30:28.214
Yes, I'm sure.

30:28.216 --> 30:29.882
Look, the only way to get
blistering like this

30:29.884 --> 30:31.050
would be from a skin condition

30:31.052 --> 30:32.552
or if you had an overwhelming

30:32.554 --> 30:36.088
and out-of-control reaction to....

30:36.090 --> 30:37.389
Stella.

30:37.391 --> 30:39.090
Stella? What's a Stella?

30:39.092 --> 30:41.025
I gotta run.

30:41.027 --> 30:42.326
But you're gonna be okay.

30:42.328 --> 30:44.861
Just apply more Silvadene cream if needed,

30:44.863 --> 30:46.162
call if your symptoms get worse,

30:46.164 --> 30:48.364
and please, Jerry, stay off the Internet.

30:51.567 --> 30:54.035
Stella! Are you there?

30:54.037 --> 30:56.603
Hank, Stella's
not answering her phone, either.

30:56.605 --> 30:57.971
Uh, Kate might have a key.

30:57.973 --> 31:00.007
No. Kate's cell's going to voicemail, too.

31:00.009 --> 31:01.174
Look, you really think that Stella

31:01.176 --> 31:02.542
has Stevens-Johnson syndrome?

31:02.544 --> 31:06.312
Her symptoms line up...
flu, rash, fever, skin pain.

31:06.314 --> 31:09.849
Stella!

31:09.851 --> 31:12.285
The only missing piece is the cause.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.253
Maybe it's a reaction to a medication.

31:14.255 --> 31:16.723
I didn't give her any meds.

31:16.725 --> 31:18.525
Stella went to Southampton's urgent care

31:18.527 --> 31:20.027
when she cut her thumb.

31:20.029 --> 31:21.895
Maybe they gave her antibiotics.

31:21.897 --> 31:24.031
No matter how she got it,
once the blistering starts,

31:24.033 --> 31:27.169
unless we catch it, it won't
stop until her skin comes off.

31:28.339 --> 31:29.471
Stella!

31:29.473 --> 31:30.806
Let's try the back.

31:30.808 --> 31:32.675
The slightest breeze
could cause an infection.

31:32.677 --> 31:34.376
I mean, her organs will shut down.

31:34.378 --> 31:36.378
Hank? Divya?

31:36.380 --> 31:38.379
Kate, do you have a house key?

31:38.381 --> 31:39.714
No. What's wrong?

31:42.752 --> 31:43.884
Oh, my God!

31:43.886 --> 31:45.252
When Stella went to urgent care,

31:45.254 --> 31:46.687
did they prescribe any antibiotics?

31:46.689 --> 31:47.954
Yes. Why?

31:47.956 --> 31:49.089
We think she's having

31:49.091 --> 31:50.791
a severe allergic reaction to them now.

31:50.793 --> 31:51.992
Kate, we need you to call 911.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.494
And find some clean cotton sheets.

32:00.102 --> 32:02.837
Hank.

32:02.839 --> 32:04.406
It spread outside the line.

32:04.408 --> 32:05.941
Bolus 1 liter saline

32:05.943 --> 32:07.509
and have another ready to go.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.949
We can't stabilize her arms.
I have to go through her nose.

32:13.951 --> 32:15.417
- We need an atomizer.
- Yeah.

32:15.419 --> 32:17.852
Maybe she has cotton balls
or... loose cotton.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.320
I'm sure that they have something...

32:19.322 --> 32:21.355
Never mind.

32:36.504 --> 32:37.971
What are you doing?

32:37.973 --> 32:39.105
Using the grape as a plug

32:39.107 --> 32:40.707
to keep the medicine inside her nose.

32:45.414 --> 32:46.448
Come on, Stella.

32:49.786 --> 32:51.086
That's it. That's it.

32:51.088 --> 32:54.089
Okay.

33:03.298 --> 33:04.565
Okay.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.866
Cover Stella with the sheets.

33:05.868 --> 33:08.636
We need to keep the lesions
as clean as possible.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.637
Hank.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.440
The rash has jumped.

33:13.442 --> 33:16.376
What?

33:16.378 --> 33:18.111
She's gonna be okay, right?

33:23.036 --> 33:24.637
Did the lab confirm
Stevens-Johnson syndrome?

33:24.639 --> 33:26.405
Yep, off the biopsy you sent this morning.

33:26.407 --> 33:27.806
- Thanks for the call.
- Yeah.

33:27.808 --> 33:29.775
We think the sloughing
of her skin is just at 10%.

33:29.777 --> 33:31.143
And you got here just in time.

33:31.145 --> 33:33.545
I need two large bore IVs of normal saline.

33:33.547 --> 33:35.147
Tell the burn unit we have a patient.

33:35.149 --> 33:36.682
Let's go.

33:36.684 --> 33:39.952
Come with me. I need you.

33:43.557 --> 33:44.757
Kate?

33:56.971 --> 33:58.771
I don't understand.

33:58.773 --> 34:00.540
Why didn't she get sick two weeks ago

34:00.542 --> 34:02.276
when she started taking the antibiotics?

34:02.278 --> 34:03.477
Stella experienced something

34:03.479 --> 34:05.713
known as delayed hypersensitivity.

34:05.715 --> 34:08.949
It's when the body reacts with
an exaggerated immune response

34:08.952 --> 34:11.786
to something perceived
as a foreign substance.

34:11.789 --> 34:13.989
But her condition was caught early.

34:25.969 --> 34:28.402
After my husband died, I just...

34:28.405 --> 34:30.371
I just lost it.

34:30.373 --> 34:33.574
That must have been
a very, very tough time for you.

34:33.577 --> 34:36.777
Most people avoided me,

34:36.780 --> 34:39.815
but I didn't blame them.

34:39.817 --> 34:42.318
Tragedy can sometimes feel contagious.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.585
Mm.

34:43.588 --> 34:45.789
But Stella, she...

34:45.791 --> 34:47.924
insisted that we go into business together.

34:47.926 --> 34:50.927
She said she wouldn't do it without me.

34:54.799 --> 34:58.467
But now I'm... I'm not sure

34:58.469 --> 35:01.871
it was as much about starting a business

35:01.873 --> 35:04.006
as it was about saving me.

35:04.008 --> 35:05.974
Yeah.

35:05.976 --> 35:08.476
It's funny, um...

35:08.478 --> 35:10.578
Stella said the same thing about you.

35:16.153 --> 35:18.087
- Good morning.
- Welcome.

35:18.089 --> 35:20.723
Dr. Lawson, your tea is getting cold.

35:20.725 --> 35:23.026
I'm more concerned with you.

35:23.028 --> 35:26.496
Well, apparently, the sac around my heart

35:26.498 --> 35:29.967
had become inflamed
and then filled with fluid.

35:29.969 --> 35:31.969
Yes, I know. I spoke
with your cardiologist.

35:31.971 --> 35:34.305
He told me you had a pericardial effusion.

35:34.307 --> 35:35.539
So then you know that

35:35.541 --> 35:37.274
had she left this condition untreated...

35:37.276 --> 35:39.108
It could have turned
into an even more serious

35:39.110 --> 35:40.743
cardiac tamponade, yeah.

35:40.745 --> 35:43.279
Two very rude words indeed.

35:43.281 --> 35:45.981
- Yes.
- So Dr. Barlow removed the fluid,

35:45.983 --> 35:47.282
he prescribed some antivirals,

35:47.284 --> 35:51.419
and now my heart will continue to beat.

35:51.421 --> 35:53.955
A very good thing. How are you feeling now?

35:59.763 --> 36:01.463
Grateful.

36:01.465 --> 36:03.299
28 points.

36:03.301 --> 36:04.667
Mr. Douglass!

36:06.271 --> 36:07.871
Uh...

36:09.407 --> 36:11.208
Good morning to you.

36:11.210 --> 36:14.211
It's so nice to see you again.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.279
It is?

36:15.281 --> 36:16.680
If it hadn't been for him,

36:16.682 --> 36:18.649
my wife wouldn't have hurt her shoulder.

36:18.651 --> 36:20.784
If she hadn't hurt her shoulder,
we wouldn't have called you.

36:20.786 --> 36:23.254
And if we hadn't called you,

36:23.256 --> 36:27.658
her heart could have stopped beating.

36:27.660 --> 36:28.692
So strange, isn't it?

36:28.694 --> 36:30.694
Life's little blessings sometimes hide

36:30.696 --> 36:35.932
in peculiar, even... rude places.

36:35.934 --> 36:39.302
Good day, Mr. Douglass.

36:39.304 --> 36:42.905
- Good-bye, Jerry.
- Have a nice walk.

36:42.907 --> 36:45.842
Now, are you sure you wouldn't welcome

36:45.844 --> 36:48.145
an investor into Hankmed?

36:49.747 --> 36:52.382
Uh, wow.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.817
No, thank you.

36:53.819 --> 36:55.118
We really don't need an investor.

36:58.356 --> 37:00.258
On the other hand...

37:01.460 --> 37:02.794
Are you serious?

37:02.796 --> 37:04.596
You're a small and honest company,

37:04.598 --> 37:06.565
exactly the type of business
he likes to invest in.

37:06.567 --> 37:09.434
Mr. Woodward said he would like
to meet the two of you

37:09.436 --> 37:10.802
as soon as possible.

37:10.804 --> 37:12.137
Huh. Well, where's the bubbly?

37:12.139 --> 37:13.638
- 'Cause I'm ready right now.
- Stella!

37:13.640 --> 37:15.540
Hank, Divya, leave now
before the lecture begins.

37:15.542 --> 37:16.741
I can't believe you.

37:16.743 --> 37:18.442
You're in the hospital, you're on an IV.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.211
You know, I think
we're needed across town, yes?

37:20.213 --> 37:21.446
Yeah, I think... I think we are.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.947
Um, bye, guys.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.415
Bye.

37:24.417 --> 37:26.217
You're barely out of the ICU.

37:26.219 --> 37:27.719
I'm going home soon.

37:27.721 --> 37:29.521
When we've been friends
as long as they have,

37:29.523 --> 37:31.123
will we be like that?

37:31.125 --> 37:33.525
I certainly hope so.

37:43.306 --> 37:48.176
Oh, uh, water glasses
go above wine glasses.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.345
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:50.347 --> 37:53.815
Ah, and utensils are placed
one inch from the table.

37:53.817 --> 37:55.350
One inch.

37:55.352 --> 37:57.718
Mrs. Woodward gave you one
of her books, didn't she?

37:57.720 --> 37:59.286
Yeah, she did.

37:59.288 --> 38:01.121
Oh, Evan. Evan, wait.

38:01.123 --> 38:03.090
I need to talk to you and Hank.

38:03.092 --> 38:05.826
Okay.

38:05.828 --> 38:07.728
All right.

38:07.730 --> 38:10.097
I have good news

38:10.099 --> 38:11.298
and bad.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.367
Okay.

38:13.369 --> 38:16.470
My lease application for
the apartment that I wanted...

38:16.472 --> 38:17.572
denied.

38:17.574 --> 38:19.841
- Oh, boy.
- Why?

38:19.843 --> 38:22.277
The landlord ran my credit

38:22.279 --> 38:24.747
and discovered that I don't have any.

38:24.749 --> 38:28.851
And now that my parents won't be
cosigning anything for me,

38:28.853 --> 38:31.487
it might take a while
for me to build up my own.

38:31.489 --> 38:33.055
Well, I can help you with that

38:33.057 --> 38:35.323
anytime you want, like... like...

38:35.325 --> 38:37.625
now would be perfect, actually.
Now would be great.

38:37.627 --> 38:40.861
So the good news is you're staying.

38:40.863 --> 38:42.096
I'm staying for a while

38:42.098 --> 38:43.697
and preparing dinners.

38:43.699 --> 38:45.933
Hey, guys.

38:45.935 --> 38:48.268
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:49.871 --> 38:51.004
Divya knows.

38:51.006 --> 38:52.005
Evan knows.

38:52.007 --> 38:53.540
Everyone knows.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.108
Eh, of course, they do.

38:55.110 --> 38:57.911
Let me help you with that, my darling.

38:57.913 --> 38:59.446
I'll finish the salad.

38:59.448 --> 39:02.415
Oh, actually, Evan,
would you grab my phone?

39:02.417 --> 39:03.683
It's in my purse.

39:03.685 --> 39:05.051
Your ph...

39:05.053 --> 39:06.719
that's a joke, right?

39:06.721 --> 39:08.087
Please?

39:24.336 --> 39:25.970
Oh, my God.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.439
These are real.

39:28.441 --> 39:31.476
Zwix Sticky Stix?

39:31.478 --> 39:34.247
I tracked down the great-grandson

39:34.249 --> 39:35.781
of the original manufacturer,

39:35.783 --> 39:38.084
and he led me to a guy in Omaha

39:38.086 --> 39:41.455
who still had some, vintage 1992.

39:41.457 --> 39:42.790
'92.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.124
Mm-hmm.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.760
Whoa.

39:46.762 --> 39:48.595
Why did you do this for me?

39:48.597 --> 39:52.232
Because it brings up memories
of you and your mom.

39:52.234 --> 39:54.534
She would have loved you,

39:54.536 --> 39:56.770
almost as much as I do.

39:56.772 --> 39:59.106
Thank you so much.

40:03.344 --> 40:07.047
Hey, so when I picked up
your phone the other day,

40:07.049 --> 40:09.082
was that call about the Zwix Stix?

40:09.084 --> 40:11.319
Yes.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.421
Yeah, it was.

40:13.423 --> 40:14.956
Well, now it all makes sense.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.591
Hey, Ev, a little help here.

40:18.161 --> 40:20.862
- Look what Paige got me.
- What?!

40:20.864 --> 40:22.030
- Zwix Sticky Stix?!
- For real!

40:22.032 --> 40:23.198
- Yeah!
- Dude, give 'em back!

40:23.200 --> 40:24.366
- Dude, no.
- Hey! Hey!

40:24.368 --> 40:25.701
You don't want 20-year-old glucose

40:25.703 --> 40:26.802
clogging your system.

40:26.804 --> 40:28.804
- Actually, yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

40:28.806 --> 40:30.205
- Hank, give 'em back!
- All right, all right.

40:30.207 --> 40:31.340
Calm down. There you go.

40:31.342 --> 40:32.475
I just want a cherry.

40:32.477 --> 40:34.009
- You get one cherry.
- Thank you.

40:37.313 --> 40:39.481
Stop eating!

40:39.483 --> 40:41.550
Dinner is almost ready.

40:41.552 --> 40:42.851
Yeah, dinner.

40:42.853 --> 40:44.152
Dinner.

40:44.154 --> 40:46.221
Okay, Divya, you know,
I'm gonna go out on a limb

40:46.223 --> 40:48.423
and be honest with you about something.

40:50.159 --> 40:51.893
- I...
- Love Italian?

40:51.895 --> 40:53.228
I...

40:53.230 --> 40:55.330
You got pizza for dinner?

40:55.332 --> 40:56.865
What?

40:56.867 --> 40:59.534
Hank told me everything.

40:59.536 --> 41:01.569
I decided we were good enough friends

41:01.571 --> 41:03.071
that we could be honest.

41:03.073 --> 41:05.373
And as long as we are being honest,

41:05.375 --> 41:08.510
I admitted that I hate to cook.

41:08.512 --> 41:11.379
You hate to c... she hates...

41:11.381 --> 41:13.014
She hates to cook.

41:13.016 --> 41:14.749
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

41:14.751 --> 41:17.052
Uh, Ev? One more thing.

41:17.054 --> 41:18.219
What?

41:20.923 --> 41:22.524
I think you were right.

41:22.526 --> 41:24.960
Now it <i>is</i> the best day ever.

41:24.962 --> 41:28.230
All right. Well, of course I was right.

41:28.232 --> 41:29.832
What was I right about?

41:29.834 --> 41:32.267
Dad. He wants us in Florida.

41:32.269 --> 41:33.735
So you want to go to the hearing?

41:33.737 --> 41:36.004
Look, if dad gets released, right?

41:36.006 --> 41:37.839
He's gonna to need some adult supervision

41:37.841 --> 41:39.540
escorting him back to the Hamptons, right?

41:39.542 --> 41:41.175
Yes.

41:41.177 --> 41:42.443
You need to listen to me more.

41:42.445 --> 41:43.878
Don't push it.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.514
What changed your mind?

41:46.516 --> 41:48.083
When we first moved here,

41:48.085 --> 41:50.886
you know, making a fresh start,
we had each other to lean on,

41:50.888 --> 41:54.089
and I think that's what helped us succeed.

41:54.091 --> 41:56.358
So now that dad has a chance
for his own fresh start...

41:56.360 --> 41:58.694
He shouldn't have to face
the parole board alone.

41:58.696 --> 42:00.095
This is what I'm saying.

42:00.097 --> 42:01.764
It's our job as his family
to support him, right?

42:01.766 --> 42:03.566
I will book the plane tickets.

42:03.568 --> 42:06.502
I'll get the prison blueprint
tattooed on my chest.

42:06.504 --> 42:09.004
God, I hope it's a small prison.

42:09.073 --> 42:11.140
This looks awesome, guys. Who
wants some... who wants some wine?

42:11.142 --> 42:12.575
Let's eat.

42:12.677 --> 42:13.809
Hey, guys.

42:13.811 --> 42:15.811
Could you open it a little faster?
