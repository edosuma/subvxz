09:18.683 --> 09:21.060
- SAMANTHA, I'M HERE BECAUSE--

09:21.143 --> 09:21.852
[knocking vigorously]

09:21.936 --> 09:24.897
GIVE ME BACK MY JEWELRY BOX!

09:27.233 --> 09:29.151
- HERE.
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT IT.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.405
IT'S HIDEOUS.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.198
- [gasps]
- OUCH.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.199
- WHERE'S ALL MY JEWELRY?

09:35.283 --> 09:36.325
- I GAVE IT TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.494
- YOU WOULD NEVER GIVE ANYBODY
ANYTHING.

09:38.577 --> 09:39.787
COUGH UP MY JEWELRY.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.497
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.832
- I'M STEPHANIE PHILLIPS.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.460
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME.

09:46.544 --> 09:51.340
AND YOU'RE WEARING
EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IT.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.758
- ROBERTA MONTGOMERY.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.802
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.725
- WE DON'T WANT
THE OTHER CHILDREN

10:00.808 --> 10:02.226
TREATING SAM DIFFERENTLY

10:02.310 --> 10:04.520
BECAUSE OF HER IMMENSE WEALTH

10:04.603 --> 10:06.897
OR THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL
WAS NAMED

10:06.981 --> 10:08.232
AFTER HER
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.818
- THEY GO TO HOOVER ELEMENTARY.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.571
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT A SIMPLE VACUUM CLEANER

10:13.654 --> 10:16.324
WOULD GIVE US ALL THIS?

10:16.407 --> 10:18.159
- IT'S J. EDGAR HOOVER.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.536
HE FOUNDED THE FBI.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.871
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.539
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO GO.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.124
- NOT WITHOUT MY JEWELRY.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.418
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU KEEP
CALLING THIS YOUR JEWELRY.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.546
THESE PIECES HAVE BEEN
IN MY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS.

10:30.629 --> 10:31.964
- ROBERTA,
YOU'RE WEARING A NECKLACE

10:32.048 --> 10:34.175
THAT SAYS "STEPHANIE."

10:34.258 --> 10:37.595
AND THAT IS MY SORORITY PIN.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.598
- YOU WERE IN TRIANGLE
TRIANGLE TRIANGLE AS WELL?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.558
HEY, SISTER.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.060
- DELTA DELTA DELTA.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.145
ALSO, WOW.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.899
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD LET
THE POLICE SORT THIS OUT.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.567
- FORGIVE ME.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.401
THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE DIFFICULT

10:52.485 --> 10:55.946
SINCE MY HUSBAND PASSED ON.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.699
- OH, I AM SO SORRY.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.911
- HIS HEART GAVE OUT
ON THE GOLF COURSE.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.664
THE PEOPLE BEHIND HIM
JUST PLAYED THROUGH.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.918
- THAT'S AWFUL.
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.337
- THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR
30TH VALENTINE'S DAY TOGETHER.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.507
SOMEHOW, THE JEWELRY FELT LIKE

11:14.590 --> 11:17.676
ERNIE HAD FOUND A WAY
TO GIVE ME ONE LAST GIFT.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.261
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.597
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
YOUR FAVORITE PIECE

11:21.680 --> 11:23.140
AS A PRESENT FROM ME?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.183
AND ERNIE.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.436
- ONLY ONE?

11:27.520 --> 11:28.646
- HEY, BERTA.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.772
WHERE'S MY GOLF BAG?

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
- I TOLD YOU, ERNIE.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.817
I THREW IT IN THE POOL HOUSE.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.152
- THANKS, BABE.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.990
- HE'S ALIVE!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.870
[funky music]

11:44.954 --> 11:47.748
[clattering]

11:54.046 --> 11:55.965
- WHOA.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.800
- I HEARD YOU SCREAM.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.300
- I DIDN'T SCREAM.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.469
I SAID, "WHOA."

12:00.553 --> 12:04.140
- WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.225
I BET YOUR CRAZY STALKER
DID THIS.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.893
I WANTED TO GET A WATER,
BUT NOW I'M AFRAID

12:07.977 --> 12:09.103
TO OPEN THE FRIDGE.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.313
- OH, COME ON.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.484
BLACK ROSES?

12:15.568 --> 12:18.737
"TO JAMES: I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT THESE MEAN."

12:18.821 --> 12:21.824
WHAT DO THESE MEAN?

12:21.907 --> 12:22.825
- LET'S SEE.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.367
YELLOW IS FRIENDSHIP.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.494
RED IS ROMANCE.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.912
BLACK IS...

12:26.996 --> 12:28.205
OH, YEAH,

12:28.289 --> 12:31.417
"LOVE ME, OR I'LL KILL YOU."

12:31.500 --> 12:33.544
[cell phone chimes]

12:33.627 --> 12:36.297
- "I'M COMING OVER LATER.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.049
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WANT TO GIVE YOU."

12:39.133 --> 12:41.594
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS NUMBER.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.720
DID YOU DO THIS?

12:42.803 --> 12:43.888
- DID YOU SEE ME DO IT?

12:43.971 --> 12:46.056
- I REALLY DO HAVE A STALKER?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.516
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO CANADA!

12:47.600 --> 12:50.811
THEIR BACON IS ALL WRONG.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.732
- JAMES, CLEAN THIS UP

12:54.815 --> 12:56.984
SO I DON'T HAVE TO ASK
WHAT YOU DID.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.321
GABBY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
FOR STEPHANIE'S VOWS?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.656
"YOU ARE THE WOMAN
FOR WHOM I WAS MADE,

13:02.740 --> 13:05.659
THE ONE WHO TAUGHT ME
HOW TO LOVE."

13:05.743 --> 13:07.203
- LOVE IS A MYTH.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.748
- WOMEN ARE CRAZY.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.750
- TOUGH KITCHEN.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.713
[funky music]

13:21.133 --> 13:23.844
- THIS IS OUR PRIVATE BLEND
FROM SUMATRA.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.180
ERNIE GRINDS THE BEANS BY HAND.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.641
- YOU CAN SERVE ME ALL
THE FROUFROU COFFEE YOU WANT,

13:28.724 --> 13:32.686
BUT I AM NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MY JEWELRY.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.729
THAT IS AMAZING.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.648
AM I TASTING HAZELNUT?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.733
- ERNIE'S AN ARTIST
WITH THE SAMOVAR.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.735
- YOU KNOW I CAN TAKE YOU,
RIGHT?

13:39.818 --> 13:42.404
I CAN PHYSICALLY HOLD YOU DOWN

13:42.488 --> 13:45.616
AND RIP MY JEWELRY OFF OF YOU.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.118
- MY SIX YEARS
IN THE ISRAELI ARMY SAYS,

13:48.202 --> 13:49.995
"BRING IT ON."

13:53.165 --> 13:55.834
- GO ON, SAM, YOU PROMISED.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.671
- OKAY, BUT YOU OWE ME.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.422
- GRANDMA?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.549
CAN I TALK TO YOU IN PRIVATE?

14:01.632 --> 14:02.967
- OF COURSE, DARLING.

14:03.050 --> 14:07.304
I ALWAYS HAVE TIME
FOR MY LITTLE SUGAR PLUM.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.306
- DON'T WORRY.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.683
SAM'S GONNA HANDLE THIS.

14:10.766 --> 14:11.892
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.394
- YOU KNOW SAM.
SHE'S REAL CONVINCING.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.105
I'VE LEARNED
NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.107
- 15 OTHER GIRLS
IN YOUR CLASS,

14:18.190 --> 14:19.316
AND SHE HAS TO BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

14:19.400 --> 14:23.404
- WHO YOU TELLING?

14:23.487 --> 14:24.530
- HERE.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.489
TAKE IT ALL.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.116
I DON'T WANT IT, ANYWAY.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.033
IT'S HIDEOUS.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.201
I'M GETTING WAY BETTER STUFF

14:29.285 --> 14:29.702
WHEN THE QUEEN COMES.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.203
- REALLY?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.246
SHE'S COMING HERE?

14:32.329 --> 14:33.455
THE QUEEN. ELIZABETH?

14:33.539 --> 14:36.959
- LATIFAH.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.127
- SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE THIS

14:38.210 --> 14:42.673
AND CATCH THE FIRST TRAIN
OUT OF CRAZY TOWN.

14:42.756 --> 14:46.427
- SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT YOUR HOUSE.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.430
- YOU PROMISED HER A PLAYDATE?

14:49.513 --> 14:50.639
AT OUR HOUSE?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.765
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.934
- DO YOU WANT THIS JEWELRY
OR NOT?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.983
[funky music]

15:01.066 --> 15:02.651
- STEPH, I NEED YOUR HELP.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.862
THERE'S A GIRL
WHO'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.948
- AW, I REMEMBER
WHEN YOUR DAD WAS THAT WAY.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.366
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO GET HIM TO STOP?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.868
- I WISH I KNEW.

15:10.951 --> 15:11.035
[doorbell]

15:14.038 --> 15:15.497
- DANA, GET IN HERE.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.958
THERE'S A PSYCHO OUT THERE.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.168
- HI, JAMES.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.838
- I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.048
- I HOPE IT'S OKAY I CAME OVER.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.674
YOU NEVER ANSWERED MY TEXT.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.675
- WHAT TEXT?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.260
- FROM BEFORE,
ABOUT COMING OVER.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.679
OH, RIGHT!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.390
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY NEW PHONE, DIDN'T I?

15:33.474 --> 15:34.850
- SO WAIT A MINUTE.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.810
YOU DID PUT THE VALENTINE
ON MY LOCKER,

15:36.894 --> 15:38.854
BUT YOU DIDN'T BREAK
INTO MY KITCHEN.

15:38.937 --> 15:40.314
YOU DID SEND ME A TEXT,

15:40.397 --> 15:45.361
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEND ME
"I'LL KILL YOU" ROSES.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.404
- ARE YOU SEEING ANOTHER GIRL?

15:47.488 --> 15:51.450
- NO, BUT MY SISTER'S A PSYCHO.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.368
- ANYWAY,

15:52.451 --> 15:54.328
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, JAMES.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.377
JAMES?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.879
JAMES?

16:03.962 --> 16:05.673
JAMES?

16:05.756 --> 16:07.716
[funky music]

16:07.800 --> 16:08.717
- OKAY, GOT 'EM.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.968
YOU READY?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.387
- YES, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS ALL DAY.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.223
VOW ME.

16:14.306 --> 16:14.640
- HERE, UH, STAND UP.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.308
- OKAY.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.142
- AND GIVE ME YOUR RING.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.436
- BUT YOU BETTER GIVE IT BACK.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.146
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
JEWELRY DRAMA TODAY.

16:26.068 --> 16:26.944
- STEPHANIE--

16:27.027 --> 16:29.113
- YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY!

16:29.196 --> 16:30.489
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:30.572 --> 16:32.116
- OKAY, WELL,
OWEN AND HIS MOM ARE OUTSIDE.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.619
TURNS OUT
HE WASN'T IGNORING ME AT SCHOOL.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.995
HE WAS BUSY
ROUNDING UP A BUNCH OF KIDS

16:37.079 --> 16:38.747
WHOSE PARENTS
MAKE THEM GROUP DATE.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.457
PLEASE, DAD,
CAN I GO TO THE MOVIES?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.418
- [sighs]

16:42.501 --> 16:42.960
BE HOME BY 10:00.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.045
- OH, THANK YOU!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.922
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

16:47.005 --> 16:49.049
OH, ISN'T VALENTINE'S DAY
THE BEST?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.592
OH!

16:50.676 --> 16:53.595
[humming excitedly]

16:53.679 --> 16:55.347
- [clears throat]

16:55.431 --> 16:56.557
STEPHANIE,

16:56.640 --> 16:59.727
ALTHOUGH LOVE CANNOT SUSTAIN US,

16:59.810 --> 17:03.439
I CANNOT BE SUSTAINED
WITHOUT LOVE.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.773
I ADMIRE YOUR PASSION

17:05.858 --> 17:07.776
AND CHERISH YOUR TOUCH.

17:07.859 --> 17:08.777
- [gasps]

17:08.861 --> 17:10.570
- LOVE ME FOREVER,

17:10.654 --> 17:16.117
AND FOREVER I WILL BE COMPLETE.

17:16.201 --> 17:16.660
- THAT WAS SO...

17:16.743 --> 17:19.121
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.749
- LAME.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.833
- LAME?

17:22.915 --> 17:25.461
NOW, THAT WAS SOME
GRADE-A PREMIUM ROMANCE!

17:25.544 --> 17:29.465
- "I ADMIRE YOUR PASSION."

17:29.548 --> 17:30.466
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE VOWS?

17:30.549 --> 17:31.467
THE INTERNET?

17:31.550 --> 17:32.551
- I HAD TO!

17:32.634 --> 17:35.637
- UGH.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.681
- NOTHING I CAME UP
WITH SEEMED GOOD ENOUGH.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.849
- OKAY, FIRST YOU GIVE ME
KIM'S VOWS,

17:38.932 --> 17:40.225
THEN YOU GIVE ME INTERNET VOWS.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.561
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR
MARRIAGE, CHARLIE?

17:42.644 --> 17:44.813
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.690
- I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY DEALING

17:46.774 --> 17:48.317
WITH THE KIDS' VALENTINES.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.569
THE ONLY LITTLE BIT OF ROMANCE
I WAS GOING TO HAVE FOR MYSELF

17:50.652 --> 17:52.654
WAS SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN LAST YEAR,

17:52.738 --> 17:54.156
BUT YOU BLEW IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.825
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT US,
CHARLIE?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.994
- WELL, ONE OF US WATCHED
SOMEONE ELSE'S WEDDING VIDEO

17:59.077 --> 18:02.039
AND LOST HER MIND.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.832
- AND WHY DON'T YOU
LOSE YOUR MIND?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.000
WHERE'S YOUR PASSION?

18:05.083 --> 18:06.460
- I'M PASSIONATE.
- PLEASE.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.003
I'LL TELL YOU I'LL MEET YOU
IN BED IN TEN.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.296
YOU'RE ASLEEP IN FIVE.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.506
- BECAUSE WHEN I MAKE IT
THE FULL TEN,

18:10.589 --> 18:13.175
YOU COME IN AND RUB CREAM
ALL OVER YOUR FEET.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.970
GREASY TOES DON'T REV MY ENGINE.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.180
- OH, YEAH? YEAH?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.682
WELL, YOU...YOU...

18:20.766 --> 18:21.725
NEVER CLEAN THE GARAGE.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.519
- OH, IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS GONNA BE?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.895
A LAUNDRY LIST OF COMPLAINTS?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.897
- DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON YOUR LAUNDRY,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.650
MR. FLOOR-IS-THE-HAMPER.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.692
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.527
YOU...

18:31.610 --> 18:33.362
YOU CAN'T SAY THE WORD CINNAMON.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.364
- I CAN SO SAY CINA-NA-MUM.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.323
- HMM?

18:36.406 --> 18:37.282
- CINNAMUM--

18:37.366 --> 18:38.116
WHO CARES? NUTMEG'S BETTER!

18:40.953 --> 18:45.541
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
QUITE THE VALENTINE'S DAY.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.708
SO MUCH FOR ROMANCE.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.044
- NEWS FLASH:

18:49.127 --> 18:51.964
THIS IS REAL ROMANCE.

18:52.047 --> 18:55.175
LOVE ISN'T FLOWERS
AND CHEESY VOWS.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.718
IT'S YOUR PARTNER'S ANNOYING,
PETTY PECCADILLOES

18:56.802 --> 18:59.096
THAT YOU SUFFER THROUGH

18:59.179 --> 19:01.473
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
LIVING WITHOUT HER.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.768
LOVE IS WAKING UP EVERY MORNING
THANKFUL FOR ANOTHER DAY

19:04.852 --> 19:06.979
OF YOU DRIVING ME CRAZY.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.568
- YOU MEAN THAT?

19:12.651 --> 19:17.072
YOU LOVE THE WAY
I DRIVE YOU CRAZY?

19:17.155 --> 19:18.198
- ABSOLUTELY.

19:21.410 --> 19:26.123
ALL YOUR MAKEUP
ALL OVER THE BATHROOM COUNTER,

19:26.206 --> 19:28.458
YOUR HAIR CLOGGING UP THE DR--

19:28.542 --> 19:32.546
- CHARLIE, YOU HAD ME AT CRAZY.
DON'T LOSE ME.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.381
[funky music]

19:36.675 --> 19:37.759
- YOU READY FOR SOME WINE?

19:37.843 --> 19:41.179
- HI, HI, HI!

19:41.263 --> 19:45.893
- DOES THAT SUMMON HER?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.770
- THIS HAS BEEN
SOME VALENTINE'S DAY.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.813
MY BLIND DATE

19:49.897 --> 19:51.899
WAS A VENTRILOQUIST.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.108
- THAT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.068
WHAT DID YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.111
- NOTHIN'.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.656
THE PUPPET WOULDN'T SHUT UP.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.617
- YOU MEAN, HE BROUGHT THE DUMMY

20:01.700 --> 20:02.367
WITH HIM ALONG ON THE DATE?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.535
- OH, YEAH.
- WHAT?

20:03.619 --> 20:07.623
- WE HAD TO WAIT AN HOUR
FOR A TABLE FOR THREE.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.625
- WAS HE AT LEAST CUTE?

20:09.708 --> 20:10.667
THE DATE, NOT THE DUMMY.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.460
- [laughs]

20:11.543 --> 20:13.086
THAT MAN HAD SO MUCH WORK DONE,

20:13.170 --> 20:17.382
THE PUPPET LOOKED MORE LIFELIKE.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.175
- WELL, I HOPE
HE PICKED UP THE CHECK.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.093
- PICKED IT UP AND HANDED IT

20:20.177 --> 20:20.969
RIGHT TO ME.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.137
- DON'T WORRY, MOM.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE FISH
IN THE SEA.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.974
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIS WIFE,

20:26.058 --> 20:29.770
ONCE I FOUND OUT HE HAD A WIFE.
