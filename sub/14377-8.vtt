00:50.433 --> 00:52.050
Dee Dee: Look at him swim!

00:52.083 --> 00:52.466
Dexter: He's fast.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.150
Let's make
him do tricks.

00:54.183 --> 00:56.300
Loop-the-loop.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.400
Roll over!

00:57.433 --> 00:59.200
Play dead.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.216
Drive a car.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.416
Work magic.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.000
Do my homework!

01:06.033 --> 01:07.066
Take out the trash!

01:07.100 --> 01:08.100
Iron my clothes.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.100
Clean my lab.

01:09.133 --> 01:10.133
Dress my Dolly.

01:10.166 --> 01:12.200
Calculate
these equations.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.233
Mom: Kids!

01:14.266 --> 01:16.150
It's almost bedtime!

01:16.183 --> 01:17.116
Look, mom,

01:17.150 --> 01:19.050
we can make
fishy do
tricks!

01:19.083 --> 01:21.116
Look, he's doing one now!

01:21.150 --> 01:23.433
Playing dead.

01:23.466 --> 01:27.033
Ok, fishy,
now roll over.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.366
<i>[Taps</i>

01:45.466 --> 01:49.466
What can we say about
our beloved fishy?

01:50.000 --> 01:50.400
Not much.

01:50.433 --> 01:52.283
We only had him
for one day.

01:52.316 --> 01:54.016
Silence, woman!

01:54.050 --> 01:55.433
Oh, yeah?
Well, you just
listen to me.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.116
Shut up!
No, you shut up!

01:57.150 --> 01:58.033
You shut up!

01:58.066 --> 01:59.066
He was my fishy, too!

01:59.100 --> 02:00.116
You shut up!

02:00.150 --> 02:01.200
Dad: Kids!

02:01.233 --> 02:04.133
Is this how
you want fishy
to remember you,

02:04.166 --> 02:06.233
bickering like
ninnies?

02:06.266 --> 02:07.400
Both: No.

02:07.433 --> 02:10.350
Fishy is your
responsibility, kids.

02:10.383 --> 02:13.166
It's your job
to send him on his way

02:13.200 --> 02:15.200
to the sewer beyond.

02:15.233 --> 02:19.016
That's where all small,
less significant pets go

02:19.050 --> 02:20.133
when they, uh...

02:20.166 --> 02:22.200
Dee Dee: Run out
of batteries?

02:22.233 --> 02:24.133
That's a nice way
to put it, Dee Dee.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.033
Dexter: What happens
in the sewer beyond?

02:27.066 --> 02:29.133
They can do whatever
they want.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.416
All day.

02:35.183 --> 02:36.233
I'm sorry, kids.

02:36.266 --> 02:39.350
It was just
fishy's time to go.

02:39.383 --> 02:42.116
[Weeping]

02:43.133 --> 02:47.466
Oh, I can't...
Face myself. No...

02:48.000 --> 02:49.066
Don't worry, kids.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.216
We'll get you
a new goldfish
in the morning.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.116
Kids: But, mom.

02:54.150 --> 02:55.033
Yes?

02:55.066 --> 02:56.383
What do we do
with fishy?

02:56.416 --> 03:00.350
Well,
that's simple, kids.

03:00.383 --> 03:03.150
Flush him!

03:07.300 --> 03:10.166
This is very
unprofessional.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.233
Yucky!

03:11.266 --> 03:15.000
Not to mention
the hygienic
implications.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.100
Oh, well,
dad said.

03:16.133 --> 03:20.033
Dexter, we can't
put fishy in...There.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.166
But we're
supposed to.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.383
Dexter, don't.

03:23.416 --> 03:25.083
Hey, give
it back!

03:25.116 --> 03:26.283
No way, Jose.

03:26.316 --> 03:31.450
I'm going to put fishy
up here, where you
can't reach him.

03:31.483 --> 03:32.466
Dexter: No fair.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.166
Time for beddy-bye.

03:34.200 --> 03:39.200
We'll give fishy
a decent burial
in the garden tomorrow.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.433
[Thinking]
Dexter, get a grip on yourself.

04:03.466 --> 04:05.166
Lightning is not scary.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.416
It is simply
the phenomenon

04:06.450 --> 04:10.383
caused by a surplus of electrons
being attracted downward

04:10.416 --> 04:12.100
by earth's protons.

04:12.133 --> 04:17.250
It is no more than
a big, wet demonstration
of static cling.

04:17.283 --> 04:19.283
Phew!

04:20.100 --> 04:21.316
Good night, Einstein.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.083
Good night, major glory.

04:23.116 --> 04:26.150
Good night,
ghost of dead fishy.

04:29.433 --> 04:33.016
Aaaaaaah!

04:33.250 --> 04:35.183
Aaaaaaah!

04:35.416 --> 04:36.333
Aaaaaaah!

04:36.366 --> 04:38.050
[Crash]

04:38.083 --> 04:41.133
Dee Dee, did you
also see the slimy,
disgusting spook fish

04:41.166 --> 04:43.150
that just
nearly killed me?

04:43.183 --> 04:44.250
No.

04:44.283 --> 04:48.466
I just like to run around
and scream real loud!

04:49.250 --> 04:51.150
[Sarcastically]
What's the matter, Dexter?

04:51.183 --> 04:54.416
Are you scared of
a little bitty fishy?

04:54.450 --> 04:57.300
Ooh! I'm really scared!

04:57.333 --> 05:01.350
Ooh! It must be
one of those
man-eating goldfish!

05:01.383 --> 05:03.466
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.116
Dexter is a fraidy-cat!

05:06.150 --> 05:08.116
Dexter is a--

05:11.033 --> 05:13.466
I've been kissed
by a dead fish!

05:14.000 --> 05:15.383
See, I told you.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.166
You know what this
means, don't you?

05:18.200 --> 05:19.233
No...

05:19.266 --> 05:22.016
That's right.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.316
Suit up!

05:55.283 --> 05:57.433
Who ya gonna call?

06:08.433 --> 06:12.133
All right,
who wants a taste?

06:38.350 --> 06:40.133
Hi, Dexter!

06:43.050 --> 06:44.366
Dexter,
it's me--Dee Dee.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.483
What are you doing
in that spook get-up?

06:47.016 --> 06:49.050
I was gonna
scare the ghost.

06:49.083 --> 06:49.466
That's dumb!

06:50.000 --> 06:50.416
It is not.

06:50.450 --> 06:54.350
We're never going to
catch him.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.383
Wait! I've got it!

06:57.416 --> 06:59.183
Follow me!

07:01.400 --> 07:02.416
Dexter?

07:02.450 --> 07:04.200
Eureka!

07:19.016 --> 07:21.050
Dexter: Dee Dee, now!

07:21.083 --> 07:23.016
I got him!

07:29.250 --> 07:30.216
Phew!

07:30.250 --> 07:32.083
Good job, Dee Dee!

07:32.116 --> 07:34.150
Now we can rest in peace.

07:34.183 --> 07:35.433
Dee Dee?

07:41.283 --> 07:42.266
Mmmmm!

07:42.300 --> 07:45.100
Always brush your teeth
after a meal.

07:45.133 --> 07:46.116
Whatever, sister.

07:46.150 --> 07:49.266
This genius is
going to bed.

08:19.100 --> 08:24.183
Dee Dee with ghostly voice:
Dexter...Dexter!

08:24.216 --> 08:26.233
Where are you?

08:26.266 --> 08:29.416
Help me! Help me!

08:30.033 --> 08:32.050
Dee Dee, are you
playing tricks?

08:32.083 --> 08:36.000
Hiding in the closet,
trying to scare me?

08:36.033 --> 08:36.433
Dexter!

08:36.466 --> 08:40.250
The toilet!
The toilet!

08:42.450 --> 08:44.416
Dee Dee!

08:44.450 --> 08:45.483
No!

08:46.016 --> 08:47.133
Dee Dee, come back!

08:47.166 --> 08:52.183
Dee Dee, I order you
to come out of
this toilet!

08:52.216 --> 08:54.150
Dexter, help me!

08:54.183 --> 08:56.100
I'm trapped in
the sewer beyond!

08:56.133 --> 08:59.350
No, you're not!
I just saw you
go down the toilet.

08:59.383 --> 09:01.166
Listen to me.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.266
There's lots of
bad fishies and stuff here,
and they won't let me go!

09:04.300 --> 09:07.316
They won't rest
until fishy is
on the other side.

09:07.350 --> 09:11.266
You've got to flush
fishy, Dexter!

09:11.300 --> 09:13.166
Dexter: Can't...Reach.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.150
It's no use. My arms,
they are too short.

09:17.183 --> 09:20.266
Come on, genius boy,
figure it out!

09:32.066 --> 09:37.266
Dee Dee,
flush the fish! Now!

09:44.033 --> 09:47.333
Phew! I'm sure glad
that's over.

09:47.366 --> 09:49.016
Huh?

09:49.466 --> 09:51.000
Look out!

09:51.033 --> 09:51.466
Egad!

09:52.000 --> 09:52.400
Help me!

09:52.433 --> 09:54.150
Dexter, it's
pulling me back,

09:54.183 --> 09:57.150
and they're
angry, Dexter,
real angry!

09:57.183 --> 10:00.200
Why? We flushed
the stupid fish!

10:00.233 --> 10:03.400
Its soul, Dexter.
It's still in
the trap.

10:05.266 --> 10:07.083
Do something!

10:07.116 --> 10:08.333
Dah!

10:13.333 --> 10:16.283
Help!

10:41.300 --> 10:45.066
How many times
have I told you...

10:45.100 --> 10:51.016
Early morning is daddy's special
bathroom privacy time?

10:51.050 --> 10:55.466
Ha! Ha! Ha!

10:59.266 --> 11:01.166
Oinkee!
Oink! Oink! Oink!

11:01.200 --> 11:02.300
Piggies!

11:02.333 --> 11:06.000
Oink! Oink! Oink!

11:06.033 --> 11:07.383
Mmmmmm!

11:08.166 --> 11:09.333
Oinkee! Oinkee!

11:09.366 --> 11:11.283
Oinkee! Oinkee!

11:11.316 --> 11:13.283
Mmmmmm!

11:13.316 --> 11:15.333
[Splash]

11:17.283 --> 11:18.200
Ha! Ha!

11:18.233 --> 11:20.283
You're pretty
dirty, sis.

11:20.316 --> 11:21.266
Oh, Dexter,

11:21.300 --> 11:25.066
I'm even prettier
when I'm clean.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.233
Gentlemen, I have
got big, big money.

11:52.266 --> 11:57.033
Why don't you throw down
a couple dozen of those
hot diskettes?

11:57.066 --> 11:58.216
Oh, no, no, sir.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.116
Due to these
competitive
times...

12:00.150 --> 12:02.300
We can only issue
one per person.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.050
I deserve that
grand prize, misters.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.200
So I must have
that golden diskette!

12:08.233 --> 12:09.200
Well, what...

12:09.233 --> 12:10.200
About them...

12:10.233 --> 12:11.350
Mr. Deserver?

12:11.383 --> 12:12.300
Man: Hey, Lucy,

12:12.333 --> 12:14.150
hurry up and move
your heinie!

12:14.183 --> 12:15.200
Ok, ok, ok!

12:15.233 --> 12:17.166
I'll just buy one,
please!

12:17.200 --> 12:18.150
Good...

12:18.183 --> 12:19.200
Choice...

12:19.233 --> 12:20.333
Sir.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.400
Here...

12:21.433 --> 12:23.033
You go...

12:23.066 --> 12:24.450

Dee Dee!

12:28.016 --> 12:28.416
Dexter!

12:28.450 --> 12:30.250
What's with
all the people?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.316

14:06.300 --> 14:08.050
Thank you.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.316
No, thank you.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.316
Why did you take
my money?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.250
You're so small
and weak, I could!

14:14.283 --> 14:15.350
Doh!

14:15.383 --> 14:19.183
Believe it or not,
I do not have time
for you.

sort of mistake.
