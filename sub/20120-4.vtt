01:29.980 --> 01:34.990
"Soldier"

02:00.010 --> 02:02.250
Stand back, rookies.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.600
Leave it to us.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.600
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

02:10.190 --> 02:11.270
Let's go!

02:20.910 --> 02:24.740
"2 hours earlier"

02:28.290 --> 02:30.539
Looks like someone was here recently.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.999
That's odd for a place this near the wall.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.290
Some bandits probably used it as a base.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.970
It said "Ruins of Utgard Castle"
on one of the signs.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.240
Who would have thought
there was a castle around here?

02:44.140 --> 02:47.059
Hey, check it out. Look what I found.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.179
Gelgar... Is that booze I see?

02:49.180 --> 02:49.730
Yeah.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.109
What the heck does it say?

02:53.110 --> 02:55.280
You're not gonna drink it now, are you?

02:56.070 --> 02:57.529
Don't be stupid.

02:57.530 --> 02:58.650
Not at a time like this.

03:00.450 --> 03:04.660
Convenient... All this contraband
to enjoy for ourselves.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.490
Now you're making us
sound like the bandits.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.540
You rookies should try to get some rest.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.719
Titans won't be roaming
around at this hour,

03:15.720 --> 03:18.010
but the rest of us will
take turns keeping watch.

03:18.550 --> 03:21.040
We'll leave from here
four hours before daybreak.

03:22.050 --> 03:23.510
Um...

03:23.930 --> 03:27.639
What if the wall isn't
actually broken after all?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.730
The Titans... Where could
they be invading from?

03:33.770 --> 03:37.500
Finding the answer to that...
is our job for tomorrow.

03:41.280 --> 03:46.990
But what if...? Maybe it's not nearly
as bad as we thought from the start.

03:48.870 --> 03:51.210
I'm just saying, but...

03:51.960 --> 03:55.709
Yeah... There's barely
any Titans around here.

03:55.710 --> 03:58.499
If the wall was really broken, that is.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.550
The only group we've really seen
was during the initial sighting.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.810
Conny? What about your village?

04:08.510 --> 04:09.690
It was destroyed.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.480
Crushed to sticks and rubble by Titans.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.440
I see... How awful...

04:16.690 --> 04:18.070
But nobody there was eaten.

04:19.070 --> 04:22.900
I think they all escaped,
so there's that to be thankful for.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.660
Wasn't the village destroyed?

04:26.450 --> 04:31.039
The houses and stuff were wrecked,
but the villagers made it out safely.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.730
If anyone was eaten, then...

04:34.160 --> 04:36.420
...there would've been blood and remains.

04:37.130 --> 04:40.960
But there wasn't any of that,
so it's the only explanation.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.350
Still... I can't stop thinking about it...

04:48.180 --> 04:50.130
There was that Titan at my house.

04:51.310 --> 04:56.100
It couldn't move on its own,
but it was lying right on top of my house.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.850
But it's weird...

04:59.440 --> 05:03.370
I don't know why, but it
reminded me of my mother...

05:04.320 --> 05:05.570
What does that...?

05:05.700 --> 05:09.159
Conny... You're still saying that? You...

05:09.160 --> 05:10.330
What an idiot!

05:12.290 --> 05:15.079
You think your mother
might have been that Titan?!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.830
Then how come you're so damn short, huh?

05:18.210 --> 05:21.376
Come on, Conny! I knew
you were pretty stupid,

05:21.401 --> 05:24.094
but this is taking it to another level!

05:26.510 --> 05:28.719
Would you just shut up?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.299
This is absurd.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.219
If this theory of yours is correct,

05:32.244 --> 05:34.874
that means your father
had to be a Titan, too.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.099
Otherwise, you know...

05:38.100 --> 05:38.940
They couldn't do it...

05:38.941 --> 05:41.520
Shut up! Go to sleep, you wench!

05:51.830 --> 05:53.990
Ymir? What are you doing?

05:54.370 --> 05:56.750
Prowling at night, Reiner? Come to see me?

05:57.830 --> 06:02.500
I'm shocked. I was under the impression
that you had no interest in women.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.970
Yeah. And it doesn't seem like
you have interest in guys, either.

06:08.970 --> 06:13.599
I thought I'd use this time to scavenge
for something that might fill my stomach.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.480
This'll probably end up being my last meal.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.440
About Conny's village...

06:21.770 --> 06:23.980
Were you joking around on purpose?

06:25.280 --> 06:27.480
I'd appreciate if you did more of that.

06:28.150 --> 06:32.029
So that he doesn't keep
worrying about his family.

06:32.030 --> 06:33.470
What are you talking about?

06:34.490 --> 06:36.329
This might do the trick.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.290
Not that I like herring, but...

06:38.960 --> 06:40.419
Is there any more?

06:40.420 --> 06:41.290
Could I see it?

06:43.840 --> 06:44.500
Go for it.

06:46.630 --> 06:47.840
Canned food, huh?

06:50.840 --> 06:53.020
What... are these letters?

06:54.010 --> 06:55.350
I can't read any of it.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.520
This says herring on it?

07:00.850 --> 07:05.260
You... are... able to read this language?

07:08.070 --> 07:09.449
Ymir...

07:09.450 --> 07:10.610
You're...

07:13.030 --> 07:14.449
Everyone, wake up!

07:14.450 --> 07:17.040
Get to the tower! Quickly!

07:20.540 --> 07:22.459
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.289
I'd be drinking right now
if it wasn't for you!

07:25.290 --> 07:27.170
This is all your fault!

07:29.420 --> 07:30.170
Let's go!

07:35.600 --> 07:37.309
Get your damn hands away from me!

07:37.310 --> 07:39.020
You piece of shit!

07:51.490 --> 07:54.400
Look at that. Those little ones
got crushed by the fatty.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.580
Dumb-asses.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.239
That was way too reckless!

07:59.240 --> 08:02.500
Couldn't you have avoided that
without wasting your blades?

08:02.920 --> 08:04.919
That's just how I do things.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.000
You better chalk that one up as an assist.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.210
How heroic of you.

08:10.170 --> 08:11.720
I'll think about it.

08:19.220 --> 08:20.560
I'm too late...

08:22.230 --> 08:24.020
The door is bashed in!

08:25.440 --> 08:26.769
The Titans broke through.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.649
Go back down and form
some sort of barricade.

08:29.650 --> 08:32.860
If you can't block them,
retreat back up here as a last resort.

08:33.780 --> 08:38.080
But that doesn't mean we'll
be able to help you though.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.330
I'm not sure if we'll still be
alive if it comes to that.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.170
We've all gotta do
what we're trained to do.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.339
Give it all we've got till we die!

08:48.340 --> 08:48.920
Understand?

08:49.500 --> 08:50.750
Got it!

08:53.510 --> 08:55.360
I'll go see how far they've come through!

08:56.140 --> 08:58.389
You guys grab boards or rods or whatever!

08:58.390 --> 08:59.680
Bring everything you can carry!

09:00.430 --> 09:01.270
Reiner!

09:01.271 --> 09:02.849
Hey!

09:02.850 --> 09:04.730
Wait up, Reiner! Hold on!

09:05.270 --> 09:09.149
Who does he think he is,
always taking the most dangerous job?

09:09.150 --> 09:10.319
Come on, man!

09:10.320 --> 09:13.070
Yeah, that's a bad habit of his.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.410
They're still below.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.540
Well, it's still locked...

09:30.090 --> 09:34.840
But it's not like this old wooden door
will keep them out for long.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.690
They're here!

09:55.150 --> 09:57.110
Bring something, quick!

10:01.700 --> 10:02.830
Is this it?

10:03.740 --> 10:04.800
Will this be it?

10:06.330 --> 10:07.730
Is this the end?

10:22.140 --> 10:23.010
No...

10:23.810 --> 10:25.350
It can't be.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.770
I won't let it happen!

10:32.650 --> 10:34.440
I'm definitely going home!

10:35.400 --> 10:36.650
Reiner!

10:43.870 --> 10:45.450
Reiner! Are you okay?!

10:45.660 --> 10:46.829
Yeah!

10:46.830 --> 10:49.410
Bertholdt, we're gonna survive and go home.

10:50.370 --> 10:52.380
We're going back to our hometown for sure.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.169
Right... Right!

10:55.170 --> 10:55.880
We're going home!

10:56.840 --> 10:58.720
Reiner! Bertholdt!

10:59.720 --> 11:00.879
Hey, that's...

11:00.880 --> 11:02.220
Have powder? A cannonball?

11:02.470 --> 11:05.679
Hell no! You'll just have to
take the whole thing!

11:05.680 --> 11:07.100
Out of the way!

11:24.990 --> 11:28.000
Looks like that worked out, miraculously.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
Yeah...

11:29.201 --> 11:31.119
It's not getting up from that.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.460
Not one of that size.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.629
What now? All we have is this knife.

11:35.630 --> 11:36.879
Should I cut off its nape?

11:36.880 --> 11:38.299
Don't even try.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.339
You'll get hurt if it grabs you.

11:40.340 --> 11:43.890
F-For now, let's retreat back upstairs.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.510
There could be more
than just one that got inside.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.350
Conny!

12:02.110 --> 12:03.240
Conny!

12:10.330 --> 12:11.460
Reiner!

12:25.430 --> 12:27.390
Uh, Reiner...

12:28.560 --> 12:29.850
Don't tell me...

12:30.890 --> 12:32.979
You're gonna jump out the window with it?!

12:32.980 --> 12:34.979
I've got no other choice!

12:34.980 --> 12:35.850
Wait!

12:37.770 --> 12:40.940
If I can just slice open its jaw...

12:42.190 --> 12:43.320
You're free!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.570
What will we do if another comes through?

13:03.130 --> 13:06.299
We won't be lucky enough
to kill a second one.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.430
Yeah, I'm with you there.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.320
Sorry... I'm sorry.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.899
I think it's broken.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.320
Yeah, just my luck.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.720
We'll need a splint and a bandage.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.610
I know.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.410
Sorry...

13:35.710 --> 13:37.920
All I've got is this dirty cloth.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.840
Sorry.

13:41.050 --> 13:43.130
No, it helps.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.840
Gotta marry her.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.509
Are you all right, Reiner?

13:47.510 --> 13:49.350
Yeah, I guess.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.559
By the way, Christa.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.769
My hand got scraped up a bit, too...

13:54.770 --> 13:57.320
Huh? Just spit on it or something.

13:58.810 --> 14:01.360
Sorry about that, Reiner.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.850
It seems like you're always saving my ass.

14:05.490 --> 14:08.830
Speaking of which, Annie risked
her life to save me, too.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.779
I've gotta pay you back sometime.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.910
Not really. It's...

14:15.580 --> 14:17.120
It's the normal thing to do.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.720
Because we're soldiers.

14:20.630 --> 14:22.209
I'm not so sure about that.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.240
I doubt I could ever be that brave.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.010
Hey, Bertholdt.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.900
Has Reiner always been like this?

14:29.720 --> 14:34.430
No... In the past, Reiner
was more of a warrior.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.430
Unlike now.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.059
What's that mean?

14:40.060 --> 14:41.770
What do you mean by warrior?

14:43.520 --> 14:46.940
For now, let's try to gather
anything useful we can find.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.320
That way when we die,
we can do so without regrets.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.659
That's the Scouts for you...

14:54.660 --> 14:57.710
They're on a different level
from the other soldiers.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.170
That's mostly it for the big ones.

15:09.630 --> 15:11.339
It's a good thing we have this tower.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.970
Yeah, we might actually survive.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.429
We'll go check on the recruits!

15:16.430 --> 15:17.430
Okay.

15:20.190 --> 15:21.480
What's that sound?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.020
The horses!

15:28.610 --> 15:29.450
Huh?

15:30.900 --> 15:31.860
Again?!

15:31.861 --> 15:33.540
What the hell is that sound?!

15:39.250 --> 15:41.370
Lynne! Henning!

15:47.250 --> 15:48.420
What was that?!

15:49.470 --> 15:50.669
It's no use.

15:50.670 --> 15:51.800
They both died instantly.

15:54.090 --> 15:55.680
This can't be...

15:56.600 --> 15:59.750
It's him! The one that
walked off towards the wall!

16:00.350 --> 16:02.340
That Beast Titan did this!

16:03.900 --> 16:07.269
A group of Titans approaching!
More than twice the number from earlier!

16:07.270 --> 16:08.729
What'd you say?!

16:08.730 --> 16:12.030
Their timing is too perfect,
like it's part of some strategy.

16:12.780 --> 16:16.280
I get the feeling they've been
toying with us from the start.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.480
This is bad! My gas is all but gone!

16:53.820 --> 16:55.030
Did I get 'em?

17:04.250 --> 17:06.060
This tower won't hold much longer.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.540
I only have a small amount of gas left.

17:09.130 --> 17:10.459
What about you?

17:10.460 --> 17:13.410
No gas here, and I used
up all of my blades.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.550
Those blunt ones the last you have left?

17:17.849 --> 17:18.550
Yeah...

17:19.180 --> 17:22.219
How many did the four of us kill?

17:22.220 --> 17:25.520
I don't know. I didn't
have the luxury to count.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.830
You know what? I think I did
a pretty good job myself.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.620
But the thing is...

17:33.570 --> 17:36.410
I wish I could have a drink before I go.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.370
Gelgar...

17:40.120 --> 17:41.870
Sorry, Nanaba.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.659
I must've hit my head...

17:44.660 --> 17:46.290
I can't hold...

17:47.120 --> 17:48.670
...any longer.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.420
Gelgar!

18:03.810 --> 18:05.020
Gelgar!

18:06.140 --> 18:09.020
Damn it! Is that all I've got?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.440
Thank God...

18:45.720 --> 18:48.599
H-How cruel.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.040
This just isn't fair.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.110
Who the hell drank
the rest of this bottle?!

19:00.950 --> 19:02.450
They got him.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.699
Quit it, Christa!

19:05.700 --> 19:08.659
The tower's about to crumble! You'll fall!

19:08.660 --> 19:10.920
But they're dying in our place!

19:11.750 --> 19:12.330
...Nanaba...

19:12.330 --> 19:13.170
...No! No!
...Nanaba...

19:13.170 --> 19:14.130
...No! No!
...And Gelgar...

19:14.131 --> 19:15.749
Father, stop!

19:15.750 --> 19:16.959
Father!

19:16.960 --> 19:19.719
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

19:19.720 --> 19:21.700
Father! No!

19:22.720 --> 19:24.260
Damn it all to hell!

19:24.930 --> 19:30.850
Hey... Do we gotta wait here now until
the tower falls and we get eaten alive?

19:31.190 --> 19:34.110
Is there nothing we can do about it?!

19:34.940 --> 19:36.359
This sucks...

19:36.360 --> 19:39.990
We'll be wiped out without
even finishing our mission.

19:42.570 --> 19:45.489
I... want to keep fighting, too.

19:45.490 --> 19:47.949
If only I had some sort of weapon,

19:47.950 --> 19:50.619
then I could fight and die alongside them.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.830
Christa... You're still
saying things like that?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.209
Don't you dare use their deaths.

19:57.210 --> 20:01.630
They didn't die so you'd have
an excuse to get yourself killed.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.639
That's not... That's not what I...

20:05.640 --> 20:08.140
You're not like Conny and the Scouts!

20:09.060 --> 20:11.640
They don't want to die,
but you don't even care.

20:12.190 --> 20:16.400
All you want to do is die in a way
that makes you seem like a hero.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.899
Th-That's not...

20:18.900 --> 20:19.900
Conny.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.449
Give me that knife you had.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.369
Huh? My knife?

20:24.370 --> 20:25.739
Just hand it over.

20:25.740 --> 20:28.450
Fine. Here.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.459
Thanks.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.709
What do you want it for?

20:34.710 --> 20:35.749
Hmm?

20:35.750 --> 20:37.500
Well, you see...

20:39.460 --> 20:41.010
I'm going to fight with this.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.470
Ymir... What are you planning?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.800
Who knows? I don't even know myself.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.640
Ymir...

20:51.810 --> 20:52.690
Christa.

20:53.770 --> 20:57.220
You've probably forgotten
all about it by now...

21:02.240 --> 21:05.359
But this might be the end, so...

21:05.360 --> 21:09.740
Try to remember... that promise we made
training on that snowy mountain.

21:12.750 --> 21:16.830
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.760
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

21:24.170 --> 21:27.260
I want you... to live
a life you're proud of.

21:39.110 --> 21:41.480
Remember our promise, Christa.

21:43.150 --> 21:44.820
Ymir! Wait!

21:49.240 --> 21:50.870
Ymir!

23:41.480 --> 23:43.430
"Live a life you're proud of."

23:44.360 --> 23:49.280
Leaving Christa and those words behind,
Ymir unleashes the power of the Titans.

23:49.990 --> 23:55.520
Between Ymir and Christa is a
powerful promise they made in the past.

23:56.910 --> 23:59.250
As Ymir battles and puts
her life on the line,

23:59.620 --> 24:04.790
Christa screams out, casting aside
the persona she's kept for so long.
