you're gonna see them after school.

He walked Theo to school

04:14.837 --> 04:16.506
You didn't speak with him?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.092
Do you think his reaction
would still be that strong?

I stood in the hallway, yes.

-All right.

Oh, I agree 100 percent.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.817
So I'm afraid if he's not gonna
let himself drink,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.028
if he feels like he has to drink,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.405

left alone, after they're gone.

to get his groceries.

What do you got for us, Steve?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.499
I was blessed by God, not to murder.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.751
I was hired from gambling debts,

11:50.835 --> 11:55.589

admitting my size.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.383

-And via your sister Lurleen,

12:11.981 --> 12:13.774
this person hired you to do murder?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.610
Via my sister Lurleen,
he said he'd clear my gambling debts.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.320

12:18.404 --> 12:21.157
supposed to testify against him
in state supreme court.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.119
So via your sister Lurleen,
you're hired to kill a witness

12:25.244 --> 12:27.079
supposed to testify
against this guy in court?

12:27.246 --> 12:30.791
Yeah, supposed to kill some dealer,
who the cops had got to flip,

12:30.916 --> 12:33.878
who sold this guy drugs,
and was gonna testify against him.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.591
I was in that courthouse
to murder when hell broke loose.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.428
Malcolm Cullinan hired you
to kill Kenny Priest?

12:42.553 --> 12:45.139
But God reached
his hand out to spare me.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.019
Steve, the district attorney
that died in the courthouse that day,

12:50.519 --> 12:51.937
she was a detective's wife.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.441
Yeah, I know the entire story
from the papers and New York One.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.444

that woman sparing you.

And you'll take a good beatin'
in this room.

13:04.283 --> 13:08.871

'cause I can't accept who I am.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.126

I get to walk out the track winners.

and my underwear's dirty

at that courthouse.

He reached out to Steve Jung
that was involved in those truck hijacks.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.015
Can we make that case against Cullinan?

14:10.140 --> 14:13.018
The trouble is Cullinan made good
on some of Steve Jung's gambling debts,

14:13.102 --> 14:14.395
but no money passed
between the two of them.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.356
-Jung never actually met Cullinan.
-The sister was the go-between.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.233
-Lurleen Jung?
-GREG: Yeah.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.985
Everything was via her.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.029
Boss, in Mike Roberts's novel,

14:24.405 --> 14:27.449
The private eye that's Mike
and the prick murderer that's Cullinan,

14:27.575 --> 14:31.245
are both banging the same girl.
What if that is this Lurleen?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.497
Think she'd have some other stories
to tell on Cullinan?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.250
-Can we get her in?
-Yeah.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.212
He gave us his sister's place,
this remorseful, Steve Jung.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.925
You'd like to put it all together,
you know?

14:45.676 --> 14:48.846
-Might be some kind of solace for Andy.
-Yeah.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.975
(SIGHS)

15:04.904 --> 15:06.488
Have a seat, Lurleen.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.000
We need you to describe your relationship
with Mike Roberts, Lurleen,

15:18.083 --> 15:19.668
and also, Malcolm Cullinan.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.464
See, they should take
every religious network off television.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.593
They'd do better,

15:28.052 --> 15:30.012
You need me to describe
those relationships

15:30.179 --> 15:36.185
because my idiot brother came in here
with his small-person acceptance speech.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.813
Because he started watching
those religious channels,

15:40.272 --> 15:42.149
and turned his brain to mush.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.401
We know that you look out
for your brother.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.656
We know that you got him work
in truck dispatch through Mike Roberts.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.617
Did you also try to help Steve out
with Malcolm Cullinan?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.995
Try to get him some type of,
uh, advancement or a leg up?

15:55.204 --> 15:58.499
My job with my brother's legs
was keeping them from getting broken.

15:58.582 --> 16:03.045
(SCOFFS) Your reference there,
uh, Steve's difficulties with bookmakers?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.506
Yeah, that was my reference there.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.633
So essentially,
protecting your brother Steve,

16:07.716 --> 16:11.553
You wound up somewhat in a position,
sacrificing yourself sexually.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.181
And that got him a job offer,
doing this contract

16:14.306 --> 16:18.185
-involving the death of Kenny Priest.
-Yeah. W... would that be fair?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.270
You think you're so smart?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.565
You think you're moving me places,
I don't want to go.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.528
I never laid down once in my life,
not knowing what I was getting out of it.

16:28.278 --> 16:32.366
Mike Roberts was a slob.
Malcolm Cullinan was a slob.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.911
You want to pin up Malcolm Cullinan?

16:36.620 --> 16:40.332
Malcolm Cullinan gave me 24 downers
to put in Mike Roberts's sidecars.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.753
You know how many sidecars it is
to keep from tasting the downers?

16:45.254 --> 16:49.550
You know how long I had
to sit with that slob at the bar?

16:50.884 --> 16:54.596
Listening to his... stupid dreams?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.767
And I'm... I'm nodding, and I'm smiling,

16:58.976 --> 17:01.562
and I'm putting these downers
in his drink.

17:04.273 --> 17:08.152
This was before you walked Mike Roberts
up to his office?

Before I walked him up
and Cullinan walked him in.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.619

to tell this story elsewhere, Lurleen,

Boss, instead of attempted murder
and possession of a controlled substance

17:41.268 --> 17:43.979
and lewd solicitation,
you suppose you might have any interest

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
strappin' Malcolm Cullinan
in on a murder beef?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.816
JAMES: Yeah, would you
have any interest in us

17:47.900 --> 17:50.486
giving Mr. Cullinan
his first life experience with a syringe,

17:50.569 --> 17:52.321
putting poison into his own vein?

17:52.488 --> 17:56.992
Yeah, a syringe drip, drip, drippin'
lethal poison into his rat bastard arm?

17:57.117 --> 17:58.285
Yeah, while he tries to figure out

17:58.368 --> 18:01.121
how his big wealth
and power can buy his ass out.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.999
Yes, I would.

-Good afternoon.

-How's the finger, Mr. Cullinan?

-(SIGHS)
-It's all right.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.235

we appreciate your coming in.

There's been a development

in one of our investigations.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.247
MALCOLM: That's kind of a long-winded way

18:43.330 --> 18:45.290
of saying the case
I'm being prosecuted on.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.667
Actually, this is different

18:46.750 --> 18:48.919
from the one you're being
prosecuted on presently.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.796
We'll be taking evidence
to the grand jury

18:50.879 --> 18:52.506

18:52.589 --> 18:54.633
The detective,
who was retired off our job.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.470
This is clearly a conversation
Mr. Sinclair will want to be a part of.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.431
Well, then why don't we get him out
of his bikini swim trunks,

19:01.557 --> 19:02.641
and back from France?

19:02.724 --> 19:05.394
Unfortunately, he doesn't return
from his vacation till next Wednesday.

represented.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.734
In the information, we're gonna present.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.779
Is my client a target or collateral
to your investigation?

If you're prepared
to have your client interviewed,

19:17.447 --> 19:19.825
we can describe how his name's come up.

I'm not prepared to do that
without consultation.

to contact Mr. Sinclair in timely fashion.

you can't tell me how my name came up?

I need to talk to Andy about this.

It was collar your nephew

Mr. Cullinan,

26:03.311 --> 26:07.023
once he engages counsel, he can't waive
counsel even if he wants to.

Don't tell me what I can and can't do.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.779
He'd have to be in consultation
with his attorney,

26:12.862 --> 26:14.239
when he waived.
Isn't that how it goes?

does that make me guilty

How many times did you
have to read him <i>Cat in the Hat?</i>

He just needs
to hear the words from you.

she's visiting.

to know his mommy

You gotta say, he's a totally free guy.

I don't think so.

Yeah, I was evaluating your presence.
