00:06.673 --> 00:09.843
[line trilling]

00:09.884 --> 00:13.138
[clock ticking]

00:13.179 --> 00:15.640
- Yo, it's Zay.
Leave a message.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.641
[phone beeps]

00:16.683 --> 00:17.767
- Zay, it's me.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.102
I know you pissed.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.022
8 1/2 months of silence
has made that very clear.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.314
But look, I just--

00:23.356 --> 00:24.983
I'm worried you might
be dead, all right?

00:25.025 --> 00:29.362
So if you could just send me
a text saying "not dead"

00:29.404 --> 00:30.572
that would be a--
[glass shattering]

00:30.613 --> 00:31.656
Shit!

00:31.698 --> 00:34.200
[sighs]
I broke my floor window.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.744
Oh, I have a floor window now

00:35.785 --> 00:37.162
and a wall toilet.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.121
These are the sort of things
you'd know

00:38.163 --> 00:39.205
if you ever call me back, man.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.416
- Hey, you jerking off in here?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
- I'm talking to
a family member, Shayla.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.628
- Ew, they don't want to hear
you cranking it.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.088
Anyway, some people
are here to see you.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.423
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.008
I didn't have time
to get into a whole thing.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.676
I gotta leave early.
- Why?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.219
- Relax, Columbo.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.763
I got to get dressed
for my haircut.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.056
- Dressed for your haircut?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.849
- Oh, Craig,
if you go to your haircut

00:57.891 --> 00:59.142
looking like an asshole,

00:59.184 --> 01:01.353
you're gonna get
an asshole's haircut.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.104
Bye.
- Bye.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.857
[sighs] That was Shayla.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.233
I don't think you'd like her.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.152
Call me back, man.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.615
- Craig!

01:15.116 --> 01:16.659
Look who it is.

01:16.701 --> 01:19.371
It's our new friends,
the Boones.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.081
[tense music]

01:21.122 --> 01:22.290
- [groans]

01:27.837 --> 01:29.297
- I'm glad you're here,

01:29.339 --> 01:31.508
even though
I was entirely comfortable

01:31.549 --> 01:34.344
being alone
with this crowd of swamp men.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.097
One of me, ten of them,
just how I like it.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.933
- Seems like a lot of people
to hand off a few berries.

01:39.974 --> 01:43.436
- Yeah, see,
before we can get those to you,

01:43.478 --> 01:45.480
there's the matter
of our compensation.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.564
- I sell the berries.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.316
We split the profits 80/20.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.317
Wasn't that the deal?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.777
- That was the old deal.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.821
- The deal you said
you were too good for.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.656
- Oh, no,
that doesn't sound like us.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.408
There's nothing
I'm too good for.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.576
- She says in her fucking
stuck-up accent.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.371
- Honestly, that is so nice.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.249
Nobody has ever said
I sounded stuck up before.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.458
- Zip it, Your Majesty.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.127
- Thank you so much.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.670
- So what,
you want a better deal?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.338
85/15, 90/10?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.965
- No, what we want
is something

02:12.007 --> 02:14.259
way more valuable
than just money.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.345
* *

02:17.387 --> 02:18.972
We want health insurance.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.473
- The fuck?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.518
- What I want is for you
to make me

02:23.560 --> 02:26.938
and my family
employees at Henry's Farm

02:26.980 --> 02:29.649
so that way, we can all join in
on the group plan.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.775
- But we don't have
a group plan.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.028
- Mom,
we got him over a barrel.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.612
We need to get cash,

02:34.654 --> 02:36.823
fatty stacks of secret cash.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.491
- Remember what happened
to Aunt Trish

02:38.533 --> 02:40.493
when she started
having them seizures?

02:40.535 --> 02:43.538
She had a brain tumor,
and they charged her

02:43.580 --> 02:46.207
$190,000 to cut it out.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.336
She lost everything and then
died working a triple shift

02:49.377 --> 02:50.337
at the Waffle House.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.504
- I never liked Aunt Trish.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.548
- Yeah, she sucked shit.
Who cares?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.718
The point is that no matter
how much cash you got,

02:56.760 --> 02:59.512
the doctors are gonna find
a way to take all of it.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.556
- OK, but starting
a health plan

03:01.598 --> 03:03.641
is incredibly expensive
for a business.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.685
- Get an HMO,
way fucking cheaper.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.853
- HMO?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.355
And then we have to make
an appointment

03:08.396 --> 03:10.815
with a doctor to just go see
another doctor?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.401
No fucking way!
We need a PPO.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.861
- A PPO is gonna fuck us
with the deductible.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.113
What are you thinking?
- It's better for travel.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.491
You know I spend half the year
in Arkansas with my kid.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.658
- Man, fuck your son.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.077
There's so much paperwork
with the PPO.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.371
- I don't want no generic
medicine for my eczema.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.497
I want the real shit.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.541
- I like Dr. Coslow,
and she's an HMO.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.043
I ain't finding
a new physical therapist!

03:30.085 --> 03:31.044
Don't touch me.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.962
[indistinct shouting]

03:33.004 --> 03:34.964
- God damn.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.424
- You want berries;

03:36.466 --> 03:37.842
we want benefits.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.261
- I'll give you a pre-existing
fucking condition.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.724
[upbeat music]

03:44.766 --> 03:47.018
- So this is crazy,
but there might actually

03:47.060 --> 03:48.561
be a way to make this work.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.605
I think we can pay for
the Boones' health care

03:50.647 --> 03:52.273
and still survive
until next harvest.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.483
I mean, it won't be pretty.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.402
- Watch out, numbers.
He's crunching.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.237
- We got to refinance
the mortgage on the farm.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.530
- Crunch.
- Defer tax payments.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.781
- Crunch.
- Sell the truck.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.282
- Crunch.
- Sell the forklift.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.327
- Crunch.
- Fire Shayla.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.329
You didn't say "crunch."

04:06.371 --> 04:08.289
- Because
we're not firing Shayla.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.458
- We don't need
an office manager, OK?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.876
She's redundant.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.587
- Craig, you can't call
people that anymore.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.548
- Shayla costs us
$30,000 a year,

04:16.589 --> 04:18.091
and she's a terrible employee.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.093
You should've let me fire her
after the porta potty thing.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.387
- I told you
when we became 50/50 partners

04:22.429 --> 04:24.806
in this business,
we're not firing anyone.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.851
- Jillian, firing people is
a normal part of being a boss.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.810
It's not a big deal.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.311
- Not a big deal?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.439
I told you about getting fired
from the waterpark, right?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.940
- You hated that job.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.026
- Yeah, I worked the big pool
on pad patrol,

04:36.067 --> 04:38.695
which is when used pads
become loose from women's

04:38.737 --> 04:41.531
and older girls' swimsuits
and float up to the top.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.616
And they absorb a lot of--
- I get it.

04:43.658 --> 04:47.620
- Well, even losing that
shitty job ruined my life.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.372
I didn't have any savings.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.041
I had to put everything
on credit card.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.083
I went into debt.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.835
I lost my apartment.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.087
That's when I started
sleeping in the billboard.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.630
- You seemed happy in the
billboard when I met you--

04:57.672 --> 04:59.466
I mean, in a sad,
desperate sort of way

04:59.507 --> 05:00.592
that nobody was buying.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.427
- I became homeless, Craig.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.387
I'm not putting another
person through that.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.681
- I've been fired, too,
and homeless.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.516
But we don't have
a choice here.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.851
- Yes, we do.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.644
What if we both gave up
part of our salary,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.438
and then that way,
we could keep Shayla?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.981
- We're paying ourselves
the minimum amount

05:15.023 --> 05:17.484
we need to survive
while we grow our business.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.152
And if I had any money
to spare,

05:19.194 --> 05:21.154
I would spare it on an
apartment without a roommate.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.531
- I thought you liked Dolores.
- I do like Dolores,

05:23.573 --> 05:24.991
but she's old as hell
and losing her mind.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.493
She thinks
I'm her dead husband,

05:26.534 --> 05:28.912
and I don't think they had
a good relationship.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.288
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked you.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.874
I'll pay for Shayla myself
out of my own salary.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.376
- You barely make
more than her.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.669
How are you gonna live?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.671
- I can go back to gig stuff
on the weekends.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.632
I've got Uber,
Postmates, ChoreSlut.biz.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.676
- OK, well, you're gonna
have to really cut back then.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.719
- I know.
- No more superfluous expenses.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.304
- That's fine.
- Only things you need.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.514
- I'm not needy.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.557
- You're gonna have
to sell your Kia.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.520
- Yeah, that's fine, good.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.979
- It's interesting.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.898
You were really loud,
and then you got all quiet.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.732
Something change?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.067
- No, I was agreeing.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.318
We can sell my car.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.361
- No fucking way.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.362
You love that Kia.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.697
You gave it a name.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.448
You'd sell Mallory?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.367
- I don't actually
call it Mallory.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.619
I know it's not a woman,
Craig,

06:09.661 --> 06:11.663
because it doesn't have
eyelashes.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.331
- Look, if you don't want to be
the bad guy,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.374
I can take care of it.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.001
Here, watch.

06:16.042 --> 06:16.876
Yo, Shayla!

06:16.918 --> 06:18.670
- Craig, don't.
- Shayla!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.755
- Oh, my God, what?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.675
- Shayla,
I love your haircut, girl.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.552
- Oh, I didn't end up
getting one.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.429
- But you left early yesterday.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.847
- Yeah, I know.
It's a crazy story.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.557
So I'm not even
gonna try telling it.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.517
- OK, well,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.019
the farm is having
financial problems,

06:34.060 --> 06:36.521
and we had to make
some hard decisions.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.982
- But I promise you're
not gonna lose your job.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.900
- What?
- And I also promise

06:40.942 --> 06:43.862
we would never choose a car
over a human being.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.196
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait, wait.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.198
Was that on the table?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.199
- No.
- Yes.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.451
- That's fucked up!

06:49.492 --> 06:50.910
I'm a great employee.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.662
I've have poured my heart
and my soul into this--

06:52.704 --> 06:54.831
[phone buzzes]

06:54.873 --> 06:56.291
Hello?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.959
Yeah, I got time
to take a survey.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.170
Own a boat?
I frickin' wish.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.546
[tense music]

07:01.588 --> 07:02.839
- So now what?

07:02.881 --> 07:04.382
- We're gonna go sell my Kia.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.926
* *

07:06.968 --> 07:08.053
- Jillian.

07:08.094 --> 07:08.928
Jillian, stop.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.347
- I'm done talking about this.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.890
If you actually
want to be nice,

07:11.931 --> 07:13.183
you could drive separately
to the dealership

07:13.224 --> 07:14.726
so I can get home.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.644
- I'm not trying to be nice.
I'm trying to win an argument.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.771
How are you gonna
get to the farm

07:17.812 --> 07:18.688
every morning without a car?

07:18.730 --> 07:19.773
- I'll be fine.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.274
I've got the billboard car.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.734
- The only reason you still
have that piece of shit

07:22.776 --> 07:24.277
is because you couldn't sell it
because it failed

07:24.319 --> 07:27.322
the emissions test--
the Florida emissions test.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.324
All you got to do is text
a picture of your car in.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.658
- It still drives.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.534
- Does the
air-conditioning work?

07:31.576 --> 07:32.994
- Yes.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.414
I mean, it's hot air,
and it gives me a headache,

07:36.456 --> 07:38.416
but it turns on.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.043
Craig,
I'm getting this car washed.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.503
Then I'm selling it back
to the dealer.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.463
You can't change my mind.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.799
- Working AC makes you happy.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.258
That car makes you happy.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.968
You are allowed to be happy.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.513
- Who cares about AC
if Shayla's life is ruined?

07:51.554 --> 07:52.972
That's just selfish.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.016
- We don't know that Shayla's
life would be ruined.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.770
I mean, it seems pretty likely,
but that's not on you, OK?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.730
You can't take responsibility
for all the bad shit

08:00.772 --> 08:01.898
that happens in the world.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.525
- This isn't about
the whole world.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.361
This is about Shayla,
a human being,

08:06.403 --> 08:08.154
someone we know and love.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.322
- Love?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.157
- Love is too--
- That was a strong word.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.242
- I overshot.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.786
She reminds me of myself, OK?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.996
Her dad also died
when she was a kid.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.624
She also does a thousand
gig economy jobs.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.751
We both have archenemies
who are dogs.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.003
- Look, I appreciate
that you have a big heart,

08:23.044 --> 08:25.588
but we are building
a business here.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.549
Sometimes in business
people get hurt.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.510
- Right, right, like Isaiah.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.387
- Oh, damn, OK.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.805
Yeah, like Isaiah.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.016
Isaiah got hurt,
and it sucked for both of us.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.976
- It probably sucked way more
for him.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.687
- But we wouldn't have the farm
if I didn't do what I did.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.397
So I'm not losing
any sleep over it,

08:42.439 --> 08:45.316

08:45.358 --> 08:46.401
OK?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.280
It was right here,
like, one second ago.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.990
- I'm sure they just moved it.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.533
- Oh, my God, it's gone.
Someone took it.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.326
- Calm down.
I'm sure it's somewhere.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.454
- Hey, have you seen
a silver 2017 Kia Forte?

08:57.495 --> 08:58.830
It's brand-new.
Smells perfect.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.873
- They're probably
just drying it.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.291
- Have you?
- I didn't see it.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.334
- God!

09:27.400 --> 09:30.362
- So my guy was drying a Kia,
went to get some rags.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.864
Someone must have drove off
with it.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.241
I wish there was anything
I could do to help.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.535
- You could show us
the security footage.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.954
- I could, but I won't.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.831
I know my rights.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.291
You got a warrant?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.293
- No, but we've got a cop
right here who could probably

09:45.335 --> 09:47.087

Officer?

What's up?
This guy try to kiss you?

09:52.550 --> 09:54.386

the security cameras

09:54.427 --> 09:55.762
without a warrant.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.348
- Ma'am, do you know how
hard it is to get a warrant?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.642
I'd have to go
to the station,

10:00.684 --> 10:02.769
fill out a form.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.232
- That's it,
just the two steps?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.192
- Here's what I can do.
I'll write up a report

10:09.234 --> 10:10.402
saying
that your car was stolen.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.362
You send it in
to your insurance company.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.905
- You're not gonna launch
an investigation?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.240

10:15.281 --> 10:17.242

cities in the world.

In the time it took for you
to tell me all this,

10:19.411 --> 10:20.829
there's been 50 murders.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.913
- 50 feels like a lot.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.456
- Yeah, there's no way it's 50.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.834
- Look, I'm pretty sure I got
more important things to do

10:25.875 --> 10:28.920
than track down
a 2017 Kia Forte.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.088
- Scrumptious.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.631

I gotta go. I'm getting a call.

pays out.

We need to get the Boones
their health insurance soon.

cool things about

that female drivers are given

assaulted so often.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.043
- Jillian.
- Jillian, wait.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.878
Tell Donnie I said,
"What's up?"

15:19.919 --> 15:22.547
* *

15:22.589 --> 15:24.215
- Shit!

15:28.011 --> 15:30.055
- What the hell is this?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.765
Can we help you?

15:31.806 --> 15:36.227
- Yes, I'm looking for a 2017
Kia Forte in gravity gray.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.854
[tense music]

15:37.896 --> 15:39.981
The one you stole from
the car wash this morning?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.108
- [laughs] Are you kidding?

15:42.150 --> 15:43.485
A Forte?

15:43.526 --> 15:45.737
You think I'm wasting my time
on a $12,000 car?

15:45.779 --> 15:49.240
- $16,545.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.700
- Bitch, I'm not going
back and forth with you

15:50.742 --> 15:51.951
on the price of Kias.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.078
Get the fuck out of my shop.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.245
- Ha-ha-ha.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.414
Jillian,
why don't we head out of here?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.208
- This is you, isn't it?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.253
- So you got a picture of me
stealing your car?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.880
It doesn't prove anything.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.383
- I think the cops might feel
differently about that.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.551
- [laughs] Oh, the cops.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.597
The cops don't investigate
no stolen fucking Fortes.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.892
But I am gonna need that phone
just in case.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.645
- Sorry, I can't do that.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.230
I'm on hold.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.607
- Get the fucking phone.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.566
- OK, OK.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.776
- Just give it to him, Jillian.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.654
- Give me the phone.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.948
- Fine, here.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.282
- Motherfucker!

16:31.324 --> 16:32.534
- Shit.
- What the...

16:32.575 --> 16:33.618
- Ugh!
- What the fuck?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.370
- [grunts]
- Ow, shit!

16:35.412 --> 16:37.956
[upbeat jazzy music]

16:37.997 --> 16:39.541
- Oh! Ahh!

16:39.582 --> 16:40.583
- Ahh!

16:40.625 --> 16:41.626
Augh!

16:41.668 --> 16:45.839
- Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

16:45.880 --> 16:49.259
[both shouting]

16:49.300 --> 16:50.927
- Ahh! Augh!

16:50.969 --> 16:52.095
Shit!

16:52.137 --> 16:54.139
Ow!
[grunting]

16:54.180 --> 16:56.057
- Jesus Christ, lady!

16:56.099 --> 16:59.769
The car's not here.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.105
We slapped a new VIN number
on it and sold it.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.189
- Sold it to who?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.316
- A used car place, Car Wow,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.193
the big one down the street.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.446
Fuck, what'd you do to Paulie?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.156
He's got a big trip coming up.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.324
[light jazzy music]

17:13.366 --> 17:15.160
- Come on, Jillian.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.037
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.288
* *

17:18.329 --> 17:20.248
- Shayla says, "What's up?"

17:20.290 --> 17:21.833
[both groaning]

17:25.920 --> 17:27.547
- What the fuck was that?

17:27.589 --> 17:28.923
- I don't know.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.800
I got tired of being pushed
around, and I snapped.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.011
I'm sorry. It's like road rage.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.637
- Road rage
is honking your horn,

17:34.679 --> 17:36.848
not beating someone senseless
with a steering wheel.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.350
- Yeah, that was crazy.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.310
Do you think I might be
repressing some anger?

17:40.352 --> 17:41.561
- Yes, Jillian, I do think so.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.980
- Yo, did Donnie say anything
about me?

17:44.022 --> 17:45.607
- No!
start the fucking car, Shayla.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.067
You almost got us killed.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.027
Would you rather die
than fire Shayla?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.862
- Yes,
'cause she's a good boss.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.572
- Start the car, Shayla.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.907
- Look, it's all over now.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.368
We'll just go to Car Wow
and get my car.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.370
- Oh, gosh.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.206
I am so sorry
that happened to you.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.332
I'm gonna go talk
to my manager,

18:02.374 --> 18:03.333
and we're gonna figure
this out.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.584
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:04.626 --> 18:05.794
- Do you guys want a water
while you wait?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.045
- I would love a water.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.297
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.882
- Please continue to hold,

18:10.924 --> 18:13.009
and the next available uncle
will be right with you.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.719
- You feeling OK?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.137
- I'm good, totally fine.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.722
- You have a little blood.
- Oh.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.392
* *

18:20.433 --> 18:23.520
It's probably from the fight.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.063
- Probably.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.940
- So I talked to my manager,

18:26.981 --> 18:28.733
and it seems you're wrong.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.485
- What?
- Yes.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.278
Car Wow has an official
corporate policy

18:32.320 --> 18:34.781
where we do not purchase
stolen vehicles.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.574
- But I saw my car in your lot.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.659
It's right there.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.202
- I don't know
what to tell you, ma'am.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.371
If you're unhappy, you can
put your cell phone number

18:41.413 --> 18:42.914
in this tablet,
and you'll receive a link

18:42.956 --> 18:43.915
to our complaint form.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.167
* *

18:46.209 --> 18:47.585
[phone buzzing]

18:47.627 --> 18:50.588
* *

18:50.630 --> 18:53.174
- Did you just trick me
into getting marketing texts?

18:53.216 --> 18:54.759
- If you don't want to receive
those anymore,

18:54.801 --> 18:56.261
just text 1 back.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.929
You'll get an activation code,
and it'll allow you

18:57.971 --> 18:59.556
to open up a Car Wow account.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.349
And after you set that up,
download the app,

19:01.391 --> 19:02.976
and you'll be able--
- I don't want an online form.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.186
I want to speak to someone
who will help me

19:05.228 --> 19:07.022
get my stolen car back.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.314
- OK.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.566
I can have you speak to Mira.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.026
- Thank you.
- She's our online virtual--

19:11.067 --> 19:12.402
- No!

19:12.444 --> 19:14.112
- Why do I keep getting texts
from Car Wow?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.697
I didn't fill out
a complaint form.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.032
- By connecting to our Wi-Fi,

19:17.073 --> 19:19.159
you've consented to receive
marketing materials.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.869
- I'm gonna consent
to deleting this shit.

19:20.910 --> 19:21.953
- OK.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.622
[phone buzzing]

19:24.664 --> 19:25.665
- I'll be right back.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.835
Zay, fuck,
I can't believe it's you.

19:28.877 --> 19:29.961
Did you get my voice mails?

19:30.003 --> 19:32.047
- Mm-hmm, all 307.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.132
That is way too many
voice mails, Craig.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.925
- I just wanted to know
you were all right.

19:35.967 --> 19:36.885
You know, you never responded.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.136
- 'Cause I was pissed.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.846
I had to move to Phoenix
'cause of you, bruh.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.181
You ever been to Phoenix?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.600
- I'm so sorry, Isaiah,
about how shit went down

19:43.641 --> 19:45.226
and what I did.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.562
- You ain't let me finish.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.648
I was pissed.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.734
But I'm not anymore.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.069
- No, that's not like you.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.820
Your favorite phrase
is "stay mad."

19:55.862 --> 19:58.948
- Yeah, I know,
but ever since I got here,

19:58.990 --> 20:01.326
I've been trying
to do things legit.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.828
- I don't want to be rude
seeing we just made up,

20:03.870 --> 20:05.121
but you full of shit.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.332
- Yeah, I know.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.583
Hey, but I met a girl

20:08.625 --> 20:11.336
who I think
you're really gonna like.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.963
I even got a job
that I go to every day.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.298
- Fuck out of here.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.425
You are not waking up
every day At 8:00 a.m.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.969
- 7:45.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.680
And I finally get it.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.473
I appreciate everything
you went through last year

20:23.515 --> 20:27.268
and how hard it is
to do shit the right way.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.062
- But I didn't, though.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.271
I did a lot of shit wrong.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.481
- Shit, what you do?

20:31.523 --> 20:34.025
Your hands are clean.
- Not that clean.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.527
I burned down the putt-putt.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.237
- They never proved that.
- Lied to cops.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.488
- Good, cops suck.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.115
- Dragged that kid's body
to the swamp.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.700
- White boy with cornrows.
He had it coming.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.742
- Fed it to a snake.

20:42.784 --> 20:43.785
- That was awesome.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.078
- Brock got shot 'cause of me.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.663
- I don't even know
who Brock is.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.914
- I turned you in.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.708
It's my fault Rodney Lamonca
wants you killed.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.670
- No, no, I put myself
in that position.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.296
I take responsibility.
- But--

20:55.338 --> 20:57.048
- You're a good dude,
Craigory.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.217
And I love you, man.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.803
And I miss you.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.013
We got to keep this brief.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.639
You know Rodney got ears
all over the place.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.057
We'll talk soon.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.767
Keep them voice mails coming.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.567
[phone buzzing]

21:15.608 --> 21:17.193
- Fucking stop texting me,
Car Wow.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.571
I don't have unlimited data.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.740
So I guess I'm never
getting my car back.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.158
- But we have to.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.576
I changed my mind
about firing Shayla.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.661
- What? Why?
- You were right.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.705
I was feeling shitty about
what I did to Zay.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.331
- I mean,
you were in a tough spot.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.209
- I guess I thought if I forced
you to make a selfish choice,

21:33.251 --> 21:34.419
then I'd feel better
about myself.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.670
But I just talked to Zay.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.964
- Wait, really?
- Yeah, he's alive.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.090
He's in Phoenix.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.925
And I'm not a terrible person.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.136
- Well, I never thought
you were a terrible person.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.888
- We have to save Shayla's job.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.307
- OK, cool, awesome.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.850
How are we gonna do that?

21:48.892 --> 21:53.438
[phone buzzing]

21:53.938 --> 21:55.482
Excuse me.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.567
I'm looking to buy a car, and
I'd like to take a test drive.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.944
- Wonderful.
I'm Ricky. I'm happy to help.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.197
Have you given any thought
to the type of car you want?

22:02.238 --> 22:04.741
- This one,
this car right here.

22:04.783 --> 22:07.994
- The lady knows.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.955
- Wow, what a smooth ride.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.832
- Yeah, it's a great vehicle.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.377
Uh, we are a little far
from Car Wow.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.296
Not supposed to go further
than a mile from the Wow.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.631
So if you want to
make your way back,

22:19.673 --> 22:22.175
I can tell you
about some very exciting

22:22.217 --> 22:23.468
financing opportunities.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.387
- OK, I'll turn around in here.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.763
[tires squealing]

22:26.805 --> 22:28.056
- Careful.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.474
A little fast on that corner.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.310
- Mm, I could go
for some tunes.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.478
Do you like tunes, Craig?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.604
- Love tunes, Jillian.

22:34.646 --> 22:35.855
You should play something
from your phone.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.774
I forget.
Does the Kia have Bluetooth?

22:37.816 --> 22:39.943
- Yes, it--
- It sure does, Craig.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.319
[light jazzy music]

22:41.361 --> 22:42.862
- Oh, OK, it's my jam.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.656
- How is your phone
already paired?

22:44.698 --> 22:46.116
- Because Mallory remembers me.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.659
- Who is Mallory?

22:47.701 --> 22:50.120
- This is my car, Ricky,
and I want it back.

22:50.161 --> 22:50.995
- What?
[tires squealing]

22:51.037 --> 22:52.288
Ahh.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.332
- If my driving's
making you uncomfortable,

22:54.374 --> 22:55.458
you could always
get the hell out.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.751
- I can't let you steal a car.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.378
Please tell your friend
to slow down.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.546
- She's doing her own thing
today, Ricky.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.589
I have no power here.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.342
- Oh, I've missed this car,
Ricky.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.927
- Stop saying my name.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.638
- See, Ricky, I don't treat
myself to things.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.473
I buy my jeans by the pound.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.018
I got my shoes
from a police auction.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.894
And I've got little feet, Ricky.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.063
That means they're
from dead kids.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.858
- Oh, my God.
- But I bought myself this car.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.484
$2,000 down.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.195
I threw up in the bathroom
after I signed the check.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.530
But driving off the lot...

23:25.572 --> 23:27.657
- Please slow down.
- I felt calm.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.242
I love this Kia.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.369
I was away from it
for six hours today,

23:31.411 --> 23:33.496
and I lost my fucking mind.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.582
- It's true.
- I believe you. Please stop!

23:35.623 --> 23:37.375
- Then you should also
believe me when I tell you

23:37.417 --> 23:38.668
I'm not giving it back.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.795
I would rather die
than let you have it.

23:40.837 --> 23:41.838
- Stop.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.381
- Are you also ready to die,
Ricky?

23:43.423 --> 23:44.549
[horn blares]

23:45.425 --> 23:46.926
- God damn.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.136
Shit.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.972
[car doors shut]

23:51.014 --> 23:54.309
[light jazzy music]

23:54.351 --> 23:56.311
Oh, guess I can
hang this up now.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.105
- Jillian,
that was fucking incredible.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.565
- Thanks, Craig.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.233
- I can't believe you
actually got your car back...

24:02.275 --> 24:04.652
- Thanks, Craig.
- For fucking Shayla.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.946
You got to be the nicest person
I ever met.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.239
- Thanks, Craig.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.741
- You OK?

24:09.783 --> 24:12.035
- I just don't know
that I want to sell Mallory.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.036
- What?
- Do you know why

24:13.078 --> 24:14.371
I went so crazy today?

24:14.412 --> 24:15.663
- Not to save Shayla's job?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.457
- Yeah, I kept telling myself
it was that.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.668
But when I got back
in the billboard car,

24:19.709 --> 24:23.421
and it was so hot
and so loud and still smells

24:23.463 --> 24:25.924
so much like that iguana
that died in the engine...

24:25.965 --> 24:27.092
- That's what that is.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.843
- I can't go back.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.512
I can't.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.514
I know that makes me an awful,
selfish person,

24:32.555 --> 24:33.848
but I just can't.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.016
- Jillian,
this is what I've been

24:35.058 --> 24:36.101
trying to tell you all day.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.435
It's OK to be selfish.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.520
- But then you had
that call with Isaiah,

24:38.561 --> 24:40.105
and you changed your mind
about that.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.940
- Oh, right, yeah.

24:41.981 --> 24:42.941
Well, fuck that.

24:42.982 --> 24:43.900
That's me and my shit.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.777
This has nothing
to do with you.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.779
Our journeys
don't have to intersect.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.030
- But I like it when they do.

24:49.072 --> 24:51.908
- Keep the car.
Jillian, you've earned it.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.412
And as my gift to you,
I'll fire Shayla.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.080
- No, I made her the promise.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.915
I should tell her. I'm her boss.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.083
- You sure?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.584
- Yeah, this is business.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.837
Sometimes in business
people get hurt.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.797
Ah!

25:05.839 --> 25:06.965
- A car?

25:07.007 --> 25:08.842
You're choosing
a fucking car over me?

25:08.883 --> 25:10.635
Fuck you, Jillian!

25:10.677 --> 25:12.929
Oh, and by the way, everyone
knows your accent's fake.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.305
[upbeat music]

25:14.347 --> 25:17.225
Cannon, cannon, cannon.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.477
- * Yeah *

25:19.519 --> 25:20.854
* Yeah *

25:20.895 --> 25:22.397

25:22.439 --> 25:24.941

25:26.317 --> 25:28.778

different flows *

25:28.820 --> 25:31.364
* I killed the last beat,
I'm out on parole *

25:31.406 --> 25:33.992
* You know the code,
point scene money gone *

25:34.034 --> 25:36.578
* You know what I'm on,
pass the Styrofoam *

25:36.619 --> 25:37.620
* Ooh, I feel good *

25:37.662 --> 25:39.164
- Sorry it took so long.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.373
- Better late than never.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.208
I'll take all the berries
I can get.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.168
Here you go.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.753
$150,000.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.463
- * Ooh, I feel good,
ooh, I feel good *

25:46.504 --> 25:49.507
* Hey, motivated,
woke up like I'ma make it *

25:49.549 --> 25:50.842
* I had a dream *

25:50.884 --> 25:52.427
* I seen Serena
playing tennis naked *

25:52.469 --> 25:54.304
* Formulate a plot *

25:54.346 --> 25:55.680
- I feel like
I'm gonna be sick.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.640
This is the most money
I've ever seen.

25:57.682 --> 25:58.725
- And almost all of it's
going to

25:58.767 --> 26:00.143
violent criminals' health care.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.479
But hey, at least we can survive
until next harvest.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.272
Who knows?
Maybe things can calm down.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.441
- What up, big bruh?

26:06.483 --> 26:08.526
- Zay? What the fuck?

26:08.568 --> 26:09.736
You shouldn't be in Florida.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.905
What about Rodney?
What if he finds you?

26:11.946 --> 26:16.034
- Yeah, it'd be crazy if
that happened, wouldn't it?

26:16.076 --> 26:19.496
Hey, Craig,
I've heard a lot about you.

in the black Sedan *

26:34.094 --> 26:36.930

my car? *

I'm a lovable gal *
