00:34.724 --> 00:36.601
My name is Peyton Westlake.

00:36.684 --> 00:41.731
I WAS a scientist on the verge
of an amazing liquid skin discovery,

00:41.814 --> 00:44.275
until they took it all away.

00:56.872 --> 01:00.125
They smashed my life
into a million pieces.

01:00.208 --> 01:04.964
Everything was destroyed -
my work, my dreams...everything.

01:10.636 --> 01:14.348
They burned away my identity -
leaving me for dead.

01:14.431 --> 01:16.810
Take him to the burn unit.

01:16.893 --> 01:19.980
Stat. Just hold on, pal.
I'm with you.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.234
But I wasn't truly dead.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.653
Driven by uncontrollable surges
of adrenaline,

01:26.736 --> 01:29.530
I had the strength of ten men.

01:30.406 --> 01:34.495
I became a monster,
left to lurk in the shadows.

01:36.288 --> 01:38.957
Now science is my only hope.

01:41.919 --> 01:45.339
My synthetic skin formula
gave me back my face...

01:46.465 --> 01:49.302
but only for 99 minutes.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.096
99 minutes...

01:52.180 --> 01:56.893
As I try to rebuild myself, I fight
for those who have no defender.

02:04.109 --> 02:06.570
Now crime has a new enemy.

02:06.653 --> 02:09.948
And justice has a brand new face.

03:56.809 --> 03:58.644
Show time.

04:14.578 --> 04:16.413
Come on, let's move.

04:41.523 --> 04:44.776
So this is yours?
Are you going ecological, Rooker?

04:44.859 --> 04:48.780
Demolition and reclamation,
Johnny Lee. That's where it's at.

04:48.905 --> 04:51.450
Intact, pigeons wouldn't live
in this dump.

04:51.575 --> 04:54.286
In pieces, it's worth millions.

04:54.369 --> 04:58.665
A good businessman follows the money,
Johnny Lee. That's why I diversify...

04:58.749 --> 05:01.835
property, businesses...you.

05:04.254 --> 05:06.048
Nico.

05:10.595 --> 05:12.013
Guys...

05:12.930 --> 05:14.473
I don't get it.

05:14.598 --> 05:17.685
Your organisation handles
coke, weed, crack...

05:17.810 --> 05:22.774
But you... You show up to supervise
a two-bit shipment of steroids.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.151
I'm not into drugs.

05:28.238 --> 05:31.908
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Strength.

05:35.079 --> 05:37.540
Thank you. Get the rest, Adam.

05:46.673 --> 05:48.467
Hey, good-looking.

05:49.928 --> 05:51.179
Hmm?

05:56.893 --> 05:58.770
Game, set and match.

05:58.895 --> 06:02.148
Always a pleasure doing business
with you, Rooker.

06:02.273 --> 06:05.527
- How's he doing?
- Er, Peter?

06:05.611 --> 06:10.615
The light should've turned this
as blue as a bruise. Shit's been cut.

06:21.085 --> 06:22.545
Are you shorting me?

06:22.670 --> 06:26.132
Fuck. It ain't happenin' on my end.

06:26.257 --> 06:28.259
Of course it's not.

06:29.385 --> 06:32.638
How long have we been
doing business? Five years?

06:32.721 --> 06:36.434
- At least four.
- We've had drinks, swapped jokes...

06:43.441 --> 06:46.528
Did you really think
you could cheat me, Johnny?

06:47.612 --> 06:49.614
Like the taste of that, Rooker?

06:52.451 --> 06:53.994
I pissed in it.

07:04.463 --> 07:07.216
Put that in the car, Adam... ADAM!

07:08.301 --> 07:09.594
You flipped, man?

07:09.719 --> 07:14.515
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Jesus, somebody cold clocked me.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.352
What the fuck?!

07:20.897 --> 07:23.817
Get him! He's got the money,
the son of a bitch!

07:23.942 --> 07:28.154
Come back here, you asshole! Hey!

07:28.738 --> 07:30.323
Come here!

07:31.283 --> 07:32.409
God damn you!

07:33.535 --> 07:35.286
God damn you!

07:38.082 --> 07:39.458
Hey!

07:41.877 --> 07:43.796
So it's true.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.006
Get him! Get him!

07:47.174 --> 07:48.717
Jesus!

07:50.052 --> 07:53.473
- I'm gonna get him!
- Who is this guy?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.400
Going down.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.617
Shit!

08:46.736 --> 08:50.865
- You made me look real bad.
- You could do worse.

08:57.414 --> 08:59.124
Run, coward, run.

09:19.437 --> 09:22.148
'Medicom Laboratories
is now closing.

09:22.231 --> 09:25.402
'All exits will be locked
in 15 minutes.

09:35.829 --> 09:38.749
- How you doing, Doc?
- What have you got?

09:38.833 --> 09:41.168
The portacom and the gene splicer.

09:41.252 --> 09:43.796
- DNA sequencer?
- I'll work on it.

09:46.257 --> 09:47.800
Is that enough?

09:47.883 --> 09:50.135
That ought to cover it.

09:50.219 --> 09:54.057
I've got a slightly dinged-up
microscope I'll let you have cheap.

09:54.140 --> 09:58.103
- No, I need that sequencer.
- OK, OK. Get back to me.

10:04.901 --> 10:06.819
Yeah, yeah. He was just here.

10:06.903 --> 10:09.031
Yeah, it's on there.

10:09.114 --> 10:12.618
OK, and remember,
you fuckin' owe me. OK.

10:18.999 --> 10:21.168
I know you're out there.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.228
Welcome back, Dr Westlake.

11:25.777 --> 11:27.863
All systems running smoothly.

11:35.328 --> 11:39.667
Lab access update - clear
through tunnels four, five, eight.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.877
Tunnel 12, train in transit.

11:42.962 --> 11:44.255
Sensors clear.

11:48.884 --> 11:52.721
Lab perimeter secure. No irregular
activity in monitored areas.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.824
Good night, Dr Westlake.

12:12.493 --> 12:14.369
Home, sweet home.

12:52.659 --> 12:57.665
Status report -
lab control systems: static.

12:57.748 --> 13:02.753
Liquid-skin system,
cryogenic storage: active capacity.

13:02.836 --> 13:07.216
Hypo-tube processors: idling at 12%.

13:12.180 --> 13:18.478
Systems await your command, Doctor.
Next status report in 30 minutes.

13:20.229 --> 13:23.900
Hello, kitty. Hello, kitty.

13:23.983 --> 13:28.280
You think I brought you some milk,
don't you? I'm afraid not, my friend.

13:28.363 --> 13:30.616
No, no, no.

13:36.288 --> 13:38.415
Well, back to work.

14:01.606 --> 14:03.692
You handsome devil.

14:14.203 --> 14:17.956
Initiating digital scan
of subject photograph.

14:19.583 --> 14:22.336
Digitisation complete.

14:23.879 --> 14:27.842
Beginning three-dimensional
photographic imaging.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.767
Completed.

14:42.566 --> 14:48.363
Implementing skin matrix formula,
number 3,714.

15:17.685 --> 15:19.771
Maybe this will be the one.

15:19.854 --> 15:24.525
Estimated
photosensitivity index: unknown.

15:28.947 --> 15:31.074
Begin countdown.

16:29.636 --> 16:31.054
99 minutes, plus...

16:34.724 --> 16:37.060
They're holding! They're holding!

16:41.481 --> 16:45.319
We did it! We did it!
We broke the 99-minute barrier!

16:47.029 --> 16:49.948
We did it! We did it! We did it!

16:58.583 --> 17:01.711
Unfortunately,
time does march on.

17:02.211 --> 17:04.338
Photosensitivity reaction.

17:04.422 --> 17:07.925
Skin matrix breakdown at 99 minutes.

17:08.008 --> 17:12.054
Failure, 99 minutes. Failure.

17:12.137 --> 17:15.141
I hate the way I look,
but what can I do?

17:15.224 --> 17:18.645
Introducing Sudden Youth,
a breakthrough for everyone with...

17:41.501 --> 17:43.921
Let us review, shall we, gentlemen?

17:45.048 --> 17:47.925
We need a replacement for Mr Lee.

17:48.009 --> 17:51.304
I'm down $100,000.

17:52.430 --> 17:58.854
And an open casket is definitely out
for Adam's funeral.

18:00.897 --> 18:03.984
- Nico?
- The drugs were ruined.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.068
Ah!

18:06.152 --> 18:12.409
My merchandise, my money and poor
Adam, all lost because of one man.

18:13.243 --> 18:16.789
What could we do? He was tossing us
around like we were nothing.

18:16.872 --> 18:20.000
You're less than nothing.
You're pathetic.

18:22.753 --> 18:29.719
Give me five men as strong as him
and I could own this town.

18:30.595 --> 18:31.805
Peter?

18:31.888 --> 18:35.850
.. Diane Platts
at the high school. Diane?

18:35.934 --> 18:36.935
Thanks, Bill.

18:37.018 --> 18:40.730
I'm at a local high school
where another student,

18:40.813 --> 18:44.818
a football player, has died
from the abuse of illegal steroids.

18:44.902 --> 18:49.406
It's another tragic case in
what is now being called Roid Rage.

18:49.489 --> 18:51.116
For more, here's Paul Raney.

18:51.199 --> 18:55.245
With Tuesday's race for district
attorney beginning to heat up,

18:55.328 --> 18:59.500
showing a commanding lead,
Ryan Mitchell seems certain to win.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.753
Earlier today he outlined
his proposed war on drugs.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.089
The FBI has traced the drugs

19:05.172 --> 19:08.467
to an organised crime ring
working in our city.

19:08.551 --> 19:10.511
Elect me your new district attorney

19:10.594 --> 19:13.764
and I will see
that this dangerous element

19:13.848 --> 19:16.351
leaking this insidious drug
onto the streets,

19:16.434 --> 19:17.561
that these animals...

19:17.644 --> 19:21.648
Animals?!
Who's he calling an animal?.!

19:21.731 --> 19:23.149
Nico.

19:25.944 --> 19:30.407
The election's a week away
and he behaves as if he's already in.

19:30.491 --> 19:32.910
Well, he's got balls,
I'll give him that.

19:32.993 --> 19:38.082
The polls give him ten points over
our man. He says he has big plans...

19:38.165 --> 19:43.420
- Governor, senator...
- I've got my own plans for Mitchell.

19:43.503 --> 19:45.340
Daddy, look, my new dress!

19:45.423 --> 19:48.801
- Not now, Jenny!
- Peter?!

19:48.885 --> 19:53.890
I thought I told you not to interrupt
me when I was discussing business.

19:53.973 --> 19:57.518
- Sorry, I thought...
- Don't think, Angela, please.

19:57.602 --> 20:00.772
It just gets you in trouble.
What's that she's wearing?

20:00.856 --> 20:03.317
That's her costume
for the school play.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.571
If you ever spent more than five
minutes with her, you'd know that.

20:09.698 --> 20:12.200
Now, gentlemen.

20:13.034 --> 20:15.079
Mr Mitchell.

20:22.962 --> 20:24.797
Dissolution at 99 minutes...

20:24.880 --> 20:26.423
Perimeter violation.

20:26.507 --> 20:30.220
- Alert, intruder in passage.
- What have we here?

20:31.388 --> 20:33.848
Alert! Intruder! Intruder!

20:33.932 --> 20:35.517
Let's find out.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.237
- You scared me.
- How did you find me?

20:47.321 --> 20:50.782
- With this.
- Ah! A tracking device.

20:50.866 --> 20:54.036
I planted it in the crate
you took from Medicom.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.997
I've been trying
to find you for months.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.295
You're very smart.

21:02.378 --> 21:05.631
I hope you're smart enough
to find your way back.

21:05.715 --> 21:07.466
Please! Dr Westlake!

21:08.676 --> 21:10.553
Just hear me out.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.097
My name is Bridget Thorne.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.099
Dr Bridget Thorne.

21:15.976 --> 21:18.436
I attended you at County Medical.

21:18.562 --> 21:21.314
Attended?

21:21.398 --> 21:24.067
Should I thank you or kill you?

21:24.150 --> 21:27.404
You were nearly dead
when they brought you in.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.155
In terrible pain.

21:29.239 --> 21:31.075
We had no choice.

21:31.158 --> 21:33.619
We had to sever your thalamic nerve.

21:33.744 --> 21:37.206
I know you can't feel anything
any more.

21:38.332 --> 21:40.876
- But now your burns have healed...
- Healed?!

21:42.169 --> 21:44.379
Does this look healed, Doctor?

21:44.505 --> 21:48.176
I've already seen what's
beneath the mask, but go ahead.

21:53.014 --> 21:56.017
I believe I can repair
your nervous system.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.811
- Impossible. It's never been done.
- Not yet.

21:58.895 --> 22:03.567
But I've developed a new micro
surgery procedure. My own design.

22:05.527 --> 22:09.614
- All I need is a subject.
- You mean a human lab rat.

22:09.698 --> 22:11.658
- Right?
- I won't lie.

22:11.783 --> 22:14.077
Go home, Doctor.
You're wasting your time.

22:14.161 --> 22:18.583
But if we can repair your nerves,
you'll be able to feel again.

22:18.666 --> 22:20.876
Think about the contribution
we'll make

22:21.002 --> 22:23.921
in the study of the nervous system.

22:24.004 --> 22:27.007
Nobody will ever have
to go through this again.

22:27.091 --> 22:31.638
Let me tell you something,
Doctor Bridget Thorne.

22:31.763 --> 22:36.893
It's been a while since I've cared
for anybody and I'm not starting now.

22:37.769 --> 22:41.606
- Just trust me.
- Why? Because you're a doctor?

22:41.731 --> 22:43.775
No. Because I care.

22:45.985 --> 22:49.573
- Your facility is fully equipped?
- The best, I promise.

22:49.698 --> 22:53.619
I'm not interested in your promises,
I'm interested in your lab.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.331
I need a DNA sequencer for research.

22:57.414 --> 22:59.708
I have a Pace Tower 9000.
Top of the line.

22:59.833 --> 23:02.295
As much log-time as I want?

23:02.378 --> 23:04.589
Yes.
And we can be there in 20 minutes.

23:18.020 --> 23:19.479
It's quiet, it's private,

23:19.563 --> 23:23.150
and you won't believe
the deal I got on the rent.

23:23.233 --> 23:26.152
Well, it certainly is spacious.

23:31.282 --> 23:32.535
Who pays for this?

23:32.660 --> 23:37.206
I wish I could say it was university
money or a genius grant.

23:37.289 --> 23:40.209
Truth is Daddy pays for everything.

23:40.292 --> 23:42.086
That must be nice.

23:43.295 --> 23:45.756
He's always believed in my work.

23:51.846 --> 23:55.099
Synthetic skin? Wow!

23:55.225 --> 23:59.437
- This is really quite brilliant.
- Yeah, for 99 minutes.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.314
Then it's a total failure.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.238
Why?

24:08.322 --> 24:12.242
Light waves break down the cells.
That's why I need your sequencer.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.537
To find a formula
that will be permanent.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.792
I don't need your pity.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.337
I don't pity you, Peyton.

24:24.672 --> 24:29.927
I just want you to know...that you
don't have to wear a mask for me.

24:34.224 --> 24:40.438
Comparative study of DNA matrix
test formula 101, 102 and 106.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.190
Mark.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.028
You sure don't waste any time,
do you?

24:49.949 --> 24:51.659
What's on the disk?

24:51.784 --> 24:54.870
My work - study, research.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.081
Somehow this survived the fire.

24:58.749 --> 25:01.418
Maybe you should make a back up.

25:01.502 --> 25:07.091
Maybe I should pass it around town,
let everybody have a crack at it.

25:07.216 --> 25:11.012
Hey, I'm on your side, remember?

25:13.806 --> 25:15.183
I'm sorry.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.770
It's all right.

25:19.896 --> 25:22.816
Come on, time for your check-up.

25:40.459 --> 25:42.962
Just hold on, pal. I'm with you.

25:49.219 --> 25:51.679
So you want to feel again?

25:54.349 --> 25:57.769
You're a freak!
Nothing but a freak!

26:17.372 --> 26:18.623
Bridget?

26:19.500 --> 26:23.004
Bridget? Where are you?

26:24.380 --> 26:26.424
Let's get to work.

26:32.555 --> 26:35.475
DNA sequencing - stable.

26:39.271 --> 26:41.273
3-2-1-6-1.

26:42.649 --> 26:46.486
Molecular balance
and structure - holding.

26:50.658 --> 26:53.160
Matrix alignment appears coherent.

27:00.042 --> 27:02.044
- Peyton!
- Huh?

27:02.127 --> 27:05.673
- You're awake!
- Bridget, it worked!

27:05.757 --> 27:07.258
It what?!

27:07.342 --> 27:10.428
You shouldn't feel sensation
for at least a week.

27:13.348 --> 27:16.225
Not that. Come, take a look at this.

27:16.309 --> 27:19.437
I must've been almost there
when my lab was destroyed.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.356
With the data on disk

27:21.440 --> 27:25.736
the DNA sequencer was able to arrange
the cells in the correct pattern.

27:25.819 --> 27:27.362
I don't understand.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.743
Voila! Liquid skin cells.

27:33.827 --> 27:38.457
- How long have they lasted?
- 300 minutes and counting.

27:40.459 --> 27:46.298
I've been synthesising a sample and
I've got almost enough for my face.

27:48.175 --> 27:52.180
- Have you tested it?
- Watch. Hold this.

27:59.354 --> 28:00.814
Cheers, Doctor.

28:02.357 --> 28:05.193
Now watch closely.

28:09.198 --> 28:10.366
Yes.

28:14.369 --> 28:15.787
Ah!

28:19.082 --> 28:22.086
You've perfected liquid skin.

28:22.170 --> 28:25.006
I don't even know
how it works, Bridget,

28:25.089 --> 28:28.342
but by tomorrow,
I'll have the secret...

28:29.844 --> 28:31.596
and the skin.

28:33.306 --> 28:35.766
I was wrong to doubt you.

28:37.394 --> 28:38.979
I had a nightmare.

28:39.062 --> 28:43.233
I dreamt you were laughing at me,
trying to hurt me.

28:43.358 --> 28:47.487
- But now I know the truth...
- The truth is it was no dream!

28:47.570 --> 28:48.989
What?!

28:49.155 --> 28:51.409
Say hello to Daddy.

28:51.492 --> 28:52.618
No!

29:04.505 --> 29:08.093
Good job.
You'll make a believer out of me yet.

29:08.176 --> 29:11.888
- What did you do to me?
- The operation was a great success.

29:11.971 --> 29:14.933
I reconnected your thalamic nerve,
all right.

29:15.975 --> 29:18.686
Reconnected it to this.

29:18.770 --> 29:20.188
What do you want?

29:20.271 --> 29:23.150
I want my $100,000 dollars you stole.

29:23.233 --> 29:27.529
But since I can't have it,
I'll take you in trade.

29:27.613 --> 29:30.240
No! Not my work! No!

30:15.537 --> 30:17.915
I reconnected
your thalamic nerve, all right.

30:17.998 --> 30:20.584
Nothing but a freak!

30:23.588 --> 30:25.798
No! No! No!

30:39.688 --> 30:41.231
Gotta get out.

30:46.361 --> 30:47.571
He's out.

31:15.934 --> 31:18.519
Learn to shoot, you bunch of gummers!

31:39.542 --> 31:41.419
Hello!

31:44.881 --> 31:48.092
- Hey, French fry!
- Ah, no.

31:51.220 --> 31:52.263
Do it.

32:18.248 --> 32:19.583
He made it!

32:22.377 --> 32:25.465
- What do you want from me?
- Your strength.

32:25.548 --> 32:29.636
- And if I don't give it?
- I destroy your research.

32:29.719 --> 32:33.348
And you'll always look
like the bottom of a shoe.

32:33.431 --> 32:35.266
I'll kill you!

32:38.896 --> 32:42.441
You see,
it goes something like this...

32:43.734 --> 32:48.697
you can either be a good boy, or...

32:50.157 --> 32:54.453
I can give you more of this.
Personally, I'd be a good boy.

32:54.537 --> 32:57.331
His strength increases with stress.

32:57.415 --> 33:01.127
With luck, the obstacle course
pushed him to a ten.

33:02.795 --> 33:07.800
Get him on the table. I want a blood
sample while he's still amped up.

33:09.386 --> 33:11.429
I trusted you!

33:11.513 --> 33:14.974
Life's a bitch...and so am I.

33:16.434 --> 33:19.562
- Ah, women.
- Never touch them.

33:21.272 --> 33:23.024
Shh!

33:33.869 --> 33:36.496
You! Why me?

33:37.706 --> 33:42.086
No ID, no face, no prints.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.964
You were the perfect subject...

33:46.048 --> 33:48.342
until you disappeared
from the hospital.

33:48.426 --> 33:52.972
Rooker thought I was scamming him,
till you appeared at his steroid buy.

33:53.055 --> 33:56.101
You are a doctor! A healer!

33:56.184 --> 34:01.898
By using your adrenal samples,
I can synthesise a black market drug

34:01.982 --> 34:06.069
that'll make Rooker's steroids
look like rat piss.

34:08.154 --> 34:11.199
- You're selling it?
- Just think. Football, boxing...

34:11.283 --> 34:14.578
Almost any sport.
Do you know what that's worth?

34:14.661 --> 34:17.956
I can fund
a dozen research facilities.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.960
- Creating more of me?
- Oh, no...

34:22.628 --> 34:24.045
Better than you.

34:30.887 --> 34:33.764
I'm nobody's lab rat,
do you understand?

34:36.851 --> 34:40.981
I have successfully replicated
Dr Westlake's strength and stamina

34:41.063 --> 34:44.150
in each of my control animals.

34:47.070 --> 34:49.989
The subjects show
radically increased strength.

34:57.206 --> 34:59.292
What's he doing to that cat?

35:03.713 --> 35:06.048
Now, that's a rat.

35:17.644 --> 35:20.105
I trusted you!

35:28.197 --> 35:29.698
Yes.

35:41.336 --> 35:42.795
Yeah...

35:55.725 --> 35:57.894
Now I've got you.

35:59.229 --> 36:00.647
So it's all there?

36:00.731 --> 36:04.151
Chemical matrix,
metabolic rate, DNA spool...

36:04.234 --> 36:09.364
Give that to any half decent lab and
we'll have a synthetic on the street

36:09.447 --> 36:11.784
by the end of the week.

36:14.286 --> 36:17.748
EK, waste the freak, please.

36:20.042 --> 36:21.585
Thank you.

36:25.547 --> 36:28.343
I need my boys ready by Tuesday.

36:29.386 --> 36:31.513
Not a problem.

36:36.768 --> 36:40.271
You guarantee they'll be
as strong as Westlake?

36:40.355 --> 36:42.274
I guarantee they'll make you happy.

36:42.358 --> 36:45.819
And happy as they make you,
I'll make you happier.

36:48.572 --> 36:51.283
You want to do it in the lab?

36:58.958 --> 37:00.960
Yes, please.

37:01.043 --> 37:03.004
I love when you say please.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.841
Son of a bitch.

37:12.889 --> 37:16.101
Hey, man! Where are you?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.938
You can hide from me...

37:21.064 --> 37:22.607
but you can't...

37:23.525 --> 37:25.068
hide from this.

37:51.471 --> 37:55.141
- You ain't so tough.
- Tough enough.

37:59.938 --> 38:01.857
You've got an eyeful!

38:58.625 --> 39:00.251
Peter?

39:01.335 --> 39:03.129
Angela.

39:04.172 --> 39:10.261
You know Dr Thorne. She's
in the industrial reclamation field.

39:10.344 --> 39:12.513
I'm sure she knows all about thrash.

39:12.596 --> 39:16.268
Actually, I have a PhD in it.

39:17.394 --> 39:19.187
Thank you, Doctor.

39:25.777 --> 39:30.157
You have some, um...L ipstick.

39:34.578 --> 39:38.415
How many times have you promised me
no more affairs?

39:38.499 --> 39:40.376
And I keep believing you.

39:40.459 --> 39:43.420
- What is it you want?
- Jenny.

39:44.547 --> 39:47.258
She loves you, Peter.
You hardly see her any more.

39:47.342 --> 39:51.554
- She NEEDS you...
- Peter... Peter, we have a problem.

39:54.140 --> 39:56.809
Go home, Angela.
We'll discuss this later.

40:02.065 --> 40:04.359
Put him out, please.

40:17.498 --> 40:21.961
This Westlake
is beginning to piss me off.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.681
So this is where you hide, Rooker.

40:46.904 --> 40:51.283
'Where's Mr Bunny?
Oh, he was hiding, huh?'

40:51.408 --> 40:56.038
- Why does he hide, huh?
- Will Daddy kiss me good night?

40:56.121 --> 40:57.623
Not tonight, honey, OK?

40:57.706 --> 41:01.628
Daddy doesn't love us any more.
Does he, Mom?

41:02.587 --> 41:04.464
Oh, honey.

41:05.548 --> 41:07.842
It's not that...

41:08.968 --> 41:13.097
Daddy has just been very distracted
by his work lately.

41:13.222 --> 41:17.352
But things will get better.
I promise, OK?

41:21.148 --> 41:26.111
- What about tomorrow night?
- Don't worry. He'll be here, OK?

41:34.412 --> 41:36.705
- Damn!
- You hear something?

41:38.124 --> 41:41.377
Yeah...your mouth.

41:41.460 --> 41:43.504
Shut up.

41:51.179 --> 41:53.556
Hello,
Peter Rooker's residence.

41:53.681 --> 41:58.394
He what?
I don't give a shit about Mitchell.

41:58.519 --> 42:01.357
We'll deal with him.
Just do it.

42:03.150 --> 42:05.611
This election's got everybody crazy.

42:05.736 --> 42:08.655
I want you to clear my schedule,
everything.

42:08.739 --> 42:10.449
Bridget's doing it tomorrow night.

42:11.658 --> 42:14.328
Everything, Peter?

42:14.911 --> 42:16.289
Tomorrow?

42:17.290 --> 42:19.542
What about the other thing
here at the house?

42:19.667 --> 42:22.587
- Cancel it.
- That might cause complications.

42:22.712 --> 42:24.839
Just do it.

42:25.715 --> 42:28.634
Peter, it wouldn't be wise.

42:28.759 --> 42:30.804
My skin.

42:34.307 --> 42:36.434
Can you stall them till I get here?

42:36.560 --> 42:38.562
- Of course.
- Thank you, Nico.

42:41.231 --> 42:42.440
Gotcha!

42:45.485 --> 42:46.862
Cancel it.

42:46.987 --> 42:49.114
That might cause complications.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.950
Just do it.

42:51.033 --> 42:54.953
Do you think you can stall them
till I get here?

42:55.079 --> 42:56.163
Of course.

42:56.288 --> 43:00.042
Thank you, Nico. I want you
to clear my schedule, everything.

43:00.167 --> 43:02.712
- Bridget's doing it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

43:02.837 --> 43:06.591
Initiating digital scan
of subject photograph.

43:07.091 --> 43:10.053
Digitisation complete.

43:10.178 --> 43:13.806
Do you think
you can stall them till I get here?

43:13.931 --> 43:16.477
- Of course.
- Thank you, Nico.

43:16.602 --> 43:19.438
I want you to clear
my schedule, everything.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.025
- Bridget's doing it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? What about...?

43:23.150 --> 43:26.445
Do you think
you can stall them...? No!

43:32.493 --> 43:35.329
Do you think
you can stall them...?

43:35.454 --> 43:39.667
Do you think
you can stall them...? No!

43:43.712 --> 43:46.131
Do you think you can stall...?

43:46.257 --> 43:49.970
Do you think you can stall them...?

43:52.055 --> 43:53.431
Yes.

43:53.556 --> 43:57.268
Beginning three
dimensional photographic imaging.

43:59.938 --> 44:03.275
It's time to meet your match, Rooker.

44:06.362 --> 44:07.988
Completed.

44:20.293 --> 44:22.837
Massive perimeter violation.

44:22.920 --> 44:29.302
Multiple intruders in Quadrant B.
Alert. Intruder alert.

44:31.262 --> 44:32.806
You've come for me.

44:32.889 --> 44:35.976
Subject mask
synthesis complete.

44:36.059 --> 44:41.856
Implementing skin matrix formula
number 2,714.

44:46.945 --> 44:50.157
Alert. Inner perimeter violated.

44:55.996 --> 44:59.416
- What's that noise?
- It's coming right at us.

45:01.418 --> 45:04.798
- Incoming. Look out!
- Out of the way!

45:07.926 --> 45:09.219
Son of a bitch!

45:22.149 --> 45:23.150
Whoa!

45:39.625 --> 45:43.004
- You missed!
- I'll make it up, Mr Rooker.

45:44.130 --> 45:47.091
Yes, you will.

45:47.174 --> 45:50.345
The serum appears to replicate
Westlake's condition...

45:51.221 --> 45:54.432
by re-aligning
the central nervous system...

45:57.560 --> 46:03.275
causing augmented strength...
fomenting rapid healing.

46:06.528 --> 46:08.280
It remains to be seen

46:08.364 --> 46:12.618
if the synthetic
causes the same psychological trauma

46:12.701 --> 46:14.870
as seen in subject Westlake.

46:59.124 --> 47:02.253
Daddy? Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy.
Don't get mad.

47:02.336 --> 47:05.590
- Why would I?
- You're sleeping at your office.

47:05.674 --> 47:08.676
- Right, Daddy?
- Yeah, that's...

47:09.677 --> 47:12.055
That's right, Jenny.

47:12.138 --> 47:14.891
Why don't you go back to bed?

47:15.767 --> 47:17.560
Yes, Daddy.

47:18.353 --> 47:21.982
Daddy, may I have some
hot chocolate, please?

47:22.066 --> 47:24.985
- You know where it is.
- But it's dark.

47:26.487 --> 47:30.240
Haven't you ever been afraid
of the dark?

47:30.324 --> 47:33.660
OK, Jenny,
but Daddy doesn't have much time.

47:36.122 --> 47:38.499
Surprise!

47:38.583 --> 47:41.168
â™ª Happy birthday to you

47:41.252 --> 47:44.589
â™ª Happy birthday to you

47:44.672 --> 47:46.966
â™ª Happy birthday, dear Peter... â™ª

47:48.259 --> 47:51.179
Didn't expect you so soon.
Everything all right?

47:51.304 --> 47:53.056
Yes.

47:53.140 --> 47:54.975
Thanks for showing up.

47:56.059 --> 47:58.436
Peter, please. Everybody's watching.

47:58.520 --> 48:01.147
Sorry. Would you like a drink?

48:04.234 --> 48:06.862
Doesn't that song remind you
of our wedding?

48:06.946 --> 48:08.906
We danced all night.

48:08.989 --> 48:12.409
I couldn't find you all night.
You and my maid of honour.

48:12.493 --> 48:15.329
And you forgot
your wedding ring again.

48:15.412 --> 48:18.665
At least you had the sense
to leave her there, too.

48:18.749 --> 48:21.544
- Peter, are you all right?
- Yes...yes.

48:21.628 --> 48:23.254
Attention, everybody.

48:23.338 --> 48:27.842
I propose a toast to the guest
of honour, my nephew Peter.

48:30.595 --> 48:33.764
Rooker is fixated
on taking out Mitchell

48:33.848 --> 48:36.310
and selling the drug on the street.

48:38.812 --> 48:41.732
But the more I think about it...

48:43.775 --> 48:49.406
legitimate medicine offers
a virtually unlimited profit.

48:52.076 --> 48:57.707
The underground's peanuts compared
to international pharmaceuticals.

49:03.212 --> 49:06.174
Well, I'll just have to
talk him into it.

49:06.258 --> 49:09.135
Like I've talked him
into everything else.

49:12.097 --> 49:16.059
Note - call my sources in the drug
industry and get ball park...

49:18.019 --> 49:20.522
You scared me.

49:21.649 --> 49:23.734
How long have you been here?

49:23.817 --> 49:25.736
Is there a problem?

49:27.488 --> 49:28.906
No, no.

49:31.366 --> 49:33.076
Shall we begin?

49:34.578 --> 49:35.872
Let's.

50:10.366 --> 50:12.076
Wonderful party, Peter.

50:12.701 --> 50:16.747
It's time, Peter.
Everybody wants to hear you play.

50:16.830 --> 50:18.374
- Play?
- For sure.

50:18.457 --> 50:20.167
There's never been a celebration

50:20.250 --> 50:24.047
at which my nephew
has not insisted on playing a sonata

50:24.130 --> 50:27.675
on his treasured baby grand,
and there never will be, right?

50:27.759 --> 50:29.219
Right, yeah.

50:30.011 --> 50:31.429
Play.

50:31.512 --> 50:33.723
Come on, Daddy. Play.

50:43.859 --> 50:45.402
Go on, Peter.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.405
Come on, Peter. Play.

50:48.488 --> 50:50.115
Play.

50:53.369 --> 50:55.955
Oh, here he goes.

51:05.381 --> 51:07.175
- Uh-huh.
- OK.

51:25.027 --> 51:26.904
So, this shot...

51:26.987 --> 51:29.031
It's going to make us strong, right?

51:29.782 --> 51:33.410
As an ox - to match your IQ.

51:34.703 --> 51:37.081
She wants to match my IQ.

51:37.916 --> 51:39.542
Joey, Joey, Joey...

51:39.626 --> 51:42.587
I'm worried the serum may have
psychological side effects.

51:42.670 --> 51:45.465
- Meaning?
- We're talking about a new science.

51:46.048 --> 51:48.342
Westlake's nervous system
is different.

51:48.426 --> 51:52.931
They may become belligerent. You
might not be able to control them.

51:53.015 --> 51:58.061
Let me worry about that -
just make them strong.

52:07.280 --> 52:10.157
- Warrant?
- Read it and weep, big mouth.

52:10.241 --> 52:12.326
Everybody stay where they are.

52:12.410 --> 52:15.079
Take this. Peter?

52:17.081 --> 52:18.624
What's Mitchell doing here?

52:18.707 --> 52:22.211
He's here as a civilian observer
until Tuesday's election,

52:22.294 --> 52:25.507
when he officially goes to work
smashing your boss's operation.

52:25.590 --> 52:27.634
Tear this place apart.

52:27.717 --> 52:29.719
What's going on, Peter?

52:29.803 --> 52:33.348
I'll be in the kitchen. Excuse me.

52:49.990 --> 52:53.036
I gave them a sedative
to keep them quiet

52:53.119 --> 52:55.997
while their nervous systems
adjust to the drug.

52:57.957 --> 53:00.251
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

53:06.090 --> 53:08.427
I'll bring you a piece of cake.

53:13.348 --> 53:14.975
It's an intimidation thing.

53:15.058 --> 53:19.771
They're trying to make you look weak
in front of everyone. Stay strong.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.445
Look, Mitchell,
I don't want any trouble.

53:26.529 --> 53:30.032
That's something you should have
thought of a long time ago.

53:30.115 --> 53:31.450
I'm bringing you down.

53:31.533 --> 53:33.786
Let's not make a big thing.

53:33.869 --> 53:35.996
For a good deal,

53:36.080 --> 53:39.250
I'll name every criminal operation
in town, how's that?

53:39.334 --> 53:43.630
- Peter? What are you doing?
- I'm not going to jail for anyone.

53:45.673 --> 53:48.051
It looks like our informant
was mistaken.

53:48.718 --> 53:51.721
The house is clean.
I apologise for any inconvenience.

53:53.849 --> 53:56.143
Thank you. OK, fellas, let's go.

53:57.227 --> 54:01.940
- I'll call after the election.
- I think we can do business.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.490
Jenny, it's your bedtime.

54:13.035 --> 54:15.663
Come on, Daddy.
I've got something for you.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.254
For your birthday. Come on,
Daddy, open it. It's for you.

54:41.482 --> 54:44.443
- It's beautiful.
- I made it myself.

54:44.526 --> 54:45.527
You did?

54:50.991 --> 54:52.659
Good night, Daddy.

54:52.743 --> 54:55.663
I love you. Happy birthday.

54:58.916 --> 55:00.376
Thank you.

55:14.224 --> 55:16.226
Where's my disk?

55:25.778 --> 55:29.281
What is it you want, Peter?
Tucking Jenny in?

55:29.365 --> 55:33.452
Playing duets, when you'd never let
her near that piano?

55:36.538 --> 55:38.791
You finally want a divorce,
don't you?

55:40.377 --> 55:44.839
You want everyone to see you're a
great father so you'll get custody?

55:45.924 --> 55:48.134
Damn it, look at me.

55:48.218 --> 55:51.220
You are not taking Jenny
away from me.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.597
No!

55:54.849 --> 55:56.310
- Peter?
- I gotta go.

55:58.937 --> 56:03.358
Is it too much to ask for you
to come see Jenny's play tomorrow?

56:21.210 --> 56:23.295
Where's everybody going?
It's my birthday.

56:23.379 --> 56:25.131
See you in hell, Rooker.

56:25.214 --> 56:27.008
What? Someone burn the cake?

56:27.092 --> 56:29.928
You'll be lucky
if that's all we burn, Rooker.

56:34.724 --> 56:36.226
Nico, what's going on?

56:36.309 --> 56:40.564
Peter, I know you know what you're
doing but this is serious shit.

56:40.648 --> 56:41.815
What?

56:41.899 --> 56:45.235
You just told Mitchell you'd give up
all our people if he cut you a deal.

56:45.319 --> 56:47.613
- Mitchell?.!
- And the whole police force!

56:47.696 --> 56:49.656
- Peter?
- WHAT!?

56:49.740 --> 56:51.325
Good night.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.286
I closed up the safe.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.788
The safe?!

56:56.831 --> 56:59.375
It's Westlake, you idiot!

57:00.501 --> 57:02.170
Westlake?!

57:07.884 --> 57:09.135
Come on!

57:09.218 --> 57:12.764
- Man, I feel fucking great!
- Yeah!

57:12.848 --> 57:15.475
You are losing!

57:16.143 --> 57:19.354
Not any more, Joey!

57:23.567 --> 57:27.738
They're every bit as strong as
Westlake on only half the dose.

57:29.615 --> 57:33.702
- Imagine them at full strength.
- I am.

57:36.956 --> 57:41.168
Street punks. They think guns make
them strong. Well, they're wrong.

57:41.252 --> 57:44.923
You want to make a point stick,
you use your fists.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.263
That's enough, children.

57:55.141 --> 57:58.812
Westlake, that son of a bitch
was in my home.

57:58.937 --> 58:01.648
Sold me out
to Mitchell and the cops.

58:01.732 --> 58:06.528
No matter what, I'll be there
tomorrow, when he takes that stage

58:06.653 --> 58:11.617
and opens his fat mouth to thank
those people for electing him DA.

58:13.036 --> 58:19.625
I'll stand and watch these hopped-up
punks rip him limb from limb.

58:27.801 --> 58:32.430
How could the beast tell her?
For the first time he was frightened.

58:40.730 --> 58:42.316
Sorry I'm late.

58:43.400 --> 58:47.238
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

58:47.321 --> 58:51.158
- You dance well.
- As do you, sir.

58:57.039 --> 58:59.334
Get out!

58:59.459 --> 59:02.545
Get OUT!

59:05.298 --> 59:09.927
For how could a monstrous creature
ever hope for the love of a woman?

59:10.052 --> 59:14.266
Much less one so beautiful? How could
the beast tell her the truth?

59:35.955 --> 59:39.917
- I think you were just wonderful!
- Thank you, Mommy.

59:41.669 --> 59:43.964
I didn't think you'd make it.

59:45.090 --> 59:46.967
I came for you and Jenny.

59:48.551 --> 59:50.762
That's all we ever wanted, Peter.

59:50.887 --> 59:54.808
I don't believe it, Jenny's play,
dinner at Chez Royale.

59:55.850 --> 59:59.605
My God!
What has come over you, Peter?

59:59.688 --> 01:00:02.775
- Hi, Angela!
- Hi!

01:00:03.317 --> 01:00:06.403
Jimmy, you were so good!

01:00:06.487 --> 01:00:07.488
So was Jenny.

01:00:07.613 --> 01:00:09.573
I want to introduce you
to my husband.

01:00:10.616 --> 01:00:11.909
Peter?

01:00:15.663 --> 01:00:18.499
- Another time.
- Yeah, sure.

01:00:18.624 --> 01:00:21.294
Bye, Jimmy.

01:00:21.377 --> 01:00:23.796
Mom, where did Dad go?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.881
I don't know, honey.

01:00:26.716 --> 01:00:28.593
Come on, let's go home.

01:00:29.219 --> 01:00:34.891
I don't care about them. I can't
care. I want my disk back, my work.

01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:37.811
It's my life.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:48.197
Ah, Jenny.

01:00:51.158 --> 01:00:53.285
God help me.

01:00:56.455 --> 01:00:57.831
The whole week before

01:00:57.956 --> 01:01:01.503
she couldn't eat, she couldn't sleep,
she was so excited.

01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:05.048
Mrs Rooker?

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:08.009
Can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

01:01:08.134 --> 01:01:11.179
Phyllis, I'll talk to you later. Yes?

01:01:13.556 --> 01:01:17.186
It's you and Jenny, you have to
get away from your husband.

01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:19.563
Excuse me?

01:01:19.688 --> 01:01:22.899
I know you don't recognise me,
but I've been to your home.

01:01:24.568 --> 01:01:27.112
Let me explain.
My name is Peyton Westlake.

01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:29.699
- Westlake?
- Yes.

01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:31.742
I'm a scientist.

01:01:31.909 --> 01:01:34.036
- I know your husband...
- Jenny!

01:01:35.246 --> 01:01:38.165
- I've been perfecting a liquid skin.
- Get in, honey.

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:41.335
I can make masks
to make me look like other people.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.837
Is this a joke?

01:01:42.962 --> 01:01:44.339
You're not listening.

01:01:44.464 --> 01:01:48.218
It was me that held your hand
at Jenny's play.

01:01:48.343 --> 01:01:50.011
You're crazy.

01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:55.475
The beast was lucky to have
such a beauty.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.227
Mommy, who's this?

01:01:57.352 --> 01:01:59.020
Honey, be quiet.

01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:02.900
- I was with my husband.
- No. You were with me.

01:02:04.068 --> 01:02:05.653
Oh, my God!

01:02:05.778 --> 01:02:07.905
Search your heart, Angela.

01:02:07.988 --> 01:02:12.284
Angela, please! Take Jenny and get
away from him while you still can.

01:02:13.368 --> 01:02:14.412
He's dangerous!

01:02:16.122 --> 01:02:19.375
- Who was that?
- I don't know, honey.

01:02:20.793 --> 01:02:22.503
I don't know.

01:02:33.724 --> 01:02:37.227
- Honey, go up and do your homework.
- OK, Mom.

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:38.728
Peter?

01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:41.773
Peter!

01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:47.363
Nico, ah...where's Peter?
I have to talk to him.

01:02:47.446 --> 01:02:49.407
He sent me to pick you up.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:53.452
You're meeting him for dinner,
remember? Chez Royale.

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.371
Right.

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:09.844
I found Westlake
and synthesised the drug.

01:03:09.928 --> 01:03:13.056
Now that I've given you everything
you wanted...

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.435
I want what's mine.

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:19.271
- I remember.
- Tell me again.

01:03:20.105 --> 01:03:24.359
I take my wife to her favourite
restaurant, Chez Royale.

01:03:24.443 --> 01:03:25.527
And then?

01:03:25.611 --> 01:03:27.904
I order her favourite Burgundy.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:34.036
I don't care about Angela, I can't.
I don't care about anybody else.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.831
I don't give a damn
about anybody else.

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.541
'He brings the Burgundy.

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:42.336
I make a heartfelt toast.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.381
- Something goes wrong?
- Something terrible.

01:03:45.465 --> 01:03:48.802
But it looks like
a retribution hit.

01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:51.221
NO!

01:03:51.304 --> 01:03:53.056
Retribution hit.

01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:03.692
Peyton!

01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:47.238
Angela!

01:04:54.453 --> 01:04:57.289
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:06.466
They're beautiful.

01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:12.472
Angela. I've been wanting
to do this for a long time.

01:05:13.389 --> 01:05:18.103
I'm sorry I missed Jenny's play.
I got tied up in a meeting.

01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:21.648
- I'll make it up to her.
- But...you were late...

01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:24.318
I'll make it up to you, too,
I promise.

01:05:24.943 --> 01:05:28.071
Merango, we'll have the burgundy now,
thank you.

01:05:32.285 --> 01:05:34.996
Dr Peyton Westlake
came to see me today.

01:05:37.248 --> 01:05:39.500
Hmm... Now, isn't that interesting?

01:05:40.668 --> 01:05:43.880
So it's all true, isn't it, Peter?
Isn't it?

01:05:43.963 --> 01:05:46.340
Maximum acceleration achieved.

01:05:50.303 --> 01:05:52.347
Peter, I'm leaving you.

01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:56.226
You and your affairs
and your dirty business deals.

01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:58.937
And I'm taking Jenny with me.

01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:01.731
I don't think so, Angela.

01:06:19.084 --> 01:06:22.921
That woman, she... she...

01:06:23.004 --> 01:06:25.089
She was my mistress.

01:06:25.173 --> 01:06:26.716
You had her killed in front of me.

01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:31.679
I did it for you, Angela.
I want us to make a new start.

01:06:31.763 --> 01:06:34.266
- Please!
- You're insane!

01:06:36.518 --> 01:06:38.020
Go!

01:06:40.981 --> 01:06:45.652
She's going to get Jenny. Follow her
and bring them both to the site.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:49.157
I have to go and vote now.

01:06:56.122 --> 01:06:58.833
Bridget. Where has he taken her?

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:05.507
I guess he knew all along
I was using him.

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:06.883
Where is Rooker?

01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:09.636
Mitchell's...hit...

01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:29.990
- Shall we get pumped up?
- Yeah, gimme that.

01:07:31.825 --> 01:07:33.161
OK.

01:07:34.996 --> 01:07:37.957
Come on, come on. Mack, move it.

01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:59.271
Rooker. What the hell
are you doing here?

01:07:59.354 --> 01:08:02.440
I'm here to celebrate the victory.

01:08:02.524 --> 01:08:06.821
I don't know what you're up to, but
until you testify, we still got you.

01:08:06.904 --> 01:08:09.156
Yes, you do.

01:08:13.494 --> 01:08:15.454
Keep an eye on him.

01:08:15.538 --> 01:08:18.750
Confidence is running high tonight
in the Mitchell camp.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:21.336
Early results point
towards a landslide win.

01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:23.004
Mitchell's strong-man image

01:08:23.087 --> 01:08:26.800
seems to have hit a responsive chord
among the voters.

01:08:26.883 --> 01:08:30.803
Security check, sir.
Sorry, but we have to check everyone.

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:47.696
Better than expected.

01:08:49.032 --> 01:08:50.783
Cool off.

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:55.203
We are ready, Mr Rooker.
I will not fail you again.

01:08:55.287 --> 01:08:57.999
Of course not. You know what to do.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:02.252
Wait till Mitchell is centre stage,
the cameras rolling,

01:09:02.336 --> 01:09:04.589
then rip his fucking head off.

01:09:07.634 --> 01:09:09.261
Exactly.

01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:12.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

01:09:12.764 --> 01:09:19.479
Candidates Truste and Vans have just
conceded the race to Ryan Mitchell!

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:24.859
It's been a long road.

01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:28.363
A lot of people worked
very hard for this.

01:09:28.447 --> 01:09:32.533
Ryan will be here shortly,
so hold on.

01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:35.078
This party's just getting started.

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:44.255
Mr Mitchell would like a moment.
He's interested in cutting that deal.

01:09:44.339 --> 01:09:46.006
He is?

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:48.718
He'd like to see you now.

01:10:01.523 --> 01:10:03.900
I want my disk.

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.074
Westlake.

01:10:13.828 --> 01:10:17.289
No more games.
I want my disk and the skin.

01:10:17.373 --> 01:10:21.419
And what will you do
if I refuse? Kill me?

01:10:21.503 --> 01:10:23.713
I don't think so.
You're not a killer.

01:10:23.797 --> 01:10:28.176
- I don't know what I am any more.
- No, you don't.

01:10:28.259 --> 01:10:30.845
- They're at the site.
- Tell me where.

01:10:30.929 --> 01:10:34.641
I'll do better than tell you,
I'll show you, my friend.

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:38.646
All right. All right.

01:10:40.147 --> 01:10:42.107
You've all been waiting patiently.

01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:46.195
Here he is, your new DA,
Ryan Mitchell!

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:07.175
- Mitchell.
- Yes, live on television...

01:11:07.259 --> 01:11:09.386
with their bare hands.

01:11:11.596 --> 01:11:13.598
Nothing like a show of strength

01:11:13.682 --> 01:11:17.310
to put the fear of God
in the hearts of children.

01:11:17.394 --> 01:11:18.395
With Mitchell gone,

01:11:18.478 --> 01:11:23.234
I'll be able to sell that serum on
the open market and make millions.

01:11:23.359 --> 01:11:25.277
Thanks to Bridget.

01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:35.204
You don't care about Mitchell
any more than I do.

01:11:36.081 --> 01:11:38.374
Let's hear it for Mr Mitchell!

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:42.045
The people have spoken.
This is your victory.

01:11:42.128 --> 01:11:46.049
If you want the disk,
you'll have to come after me.

01:11:46.132 --> 01:11:47.842
Offer of a lifetime?

01:11:57.186 --> 01:11:58.437
My friends...

01:12:01.773 --> 01:12:06.404
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:10.491
- Keep it moving.
- Get back up.

01:12:13.578 --> 01:12:14.870
Come on!

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.336
Moving on track seven,
approaching transfer.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:33.202
- Stay still. Everything's OK.
- Please, Jenny shouldn't be here.

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:35.329
Please, don't hurt her.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:39.959
She has to stay, understand,
Mrs Rooker? She has to stay.

01:13:40.043 --> 01:13:44.464
I won't hurt her, Mrs Rooker,
just stand still.

01:13:44.547 --> 01:13:46.966
Everything will be perfectly OK.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.105
- Angela!
- Peyton!

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:02.649
No need to shout, French fry.

01:14:06.695 --> 01:14:09.407
Angela! Jenny! Hold on!

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:11.993
You've been a bad boy!

01:14:14.745 --> 01:14:16.247
He's mine, Mack.

01:14:20.084 --> 01:14:22.878
Again! You getting too much sun.

01:14:34.015 --> 01:14:36.351
Joey!

01:14:37.477 --> 01:14:39.522
What's happening?

01:14:41.357 --> 01:14:43.317
Fight me, you bastard!

01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:01.002
Need a lift, tough guy?

01:15:26.195 --> 01:15:27.530
Gotcha!

01:15:32.576 --> 01:15:34.495
What the...?

01:15:35.454 --> 01:15:36.539
Whoa!

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.215
Angela!

01:15:45.298 --> 01:15:48.259
Hold it right there, Doc!

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:54.058
A gun? Tough guy like you? I thought
you'd want to do this man to man.

01:15:54.141 --> 01:15:57.019
Since when were you considered a man?

01:15:57.728 --> 01:16:01.231
Freak!
I suppose you're looking for this?

01:16:02.733 --> 01:16:04.693
No!

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:09.407
Pretty good shooting, huh? Step back.

01:16:12.744 --> 01:16:15.747
And I know you're looking for this.

01:16:16.497 --> 01:16:21.794
The only sample.
Just enough for your ugly face.

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:26.675
But I don't think you'll be needing
that any longer, Doc.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.856
Angela.

01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.775
I couldn't let him hurt you.

01:16:42.858 --> 01:16:44.735
Let's get Jenny and go.

01:16:44.902 --> 01:16:46.153
NO!

01:16:47.988 --> 01:16:52.368
Let me be, Angela. I'm a new man now.
Stronger than ever!

01:16:54.036 --> 01:16:57.207
You tried to kill me. My own wife.

01:16:57.332 --> 01:17:00.502
That was not nice!

01:17:08.343 --> 01:17:10.804
It's your wake-up call, Doc!

01:17:18.437 --> 01:17:20.063
Peter, God, no!

01:17:26.863 --> 01:17:29.240
Ride 'em, cowboy!

01:17:31.242 --> 01:17:34.412
- Daddy, don't!
- Jenny, get back! Get back!

01:17:34.537 --> 01:17:36.664
Don't hurt him, Daddy!

01:17:47.759 --> 01:17:50.845
Jenny, please! God, no! God!

01:17:59.063 --> 01:18:02.650
It's OK. It's OK, baby. Just hold on.

01:18:16.914 --> 01:18:21.294
God, no! Please...please, honey!

01:18:55.246 --> 01:18:57.457
Welcome to Rooker World!

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.006
My skin!

01:19:08.968 --> 01:19:10.261
Gotcha!

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:33.411
You always talk about strength,
but a strong man loves his wife...

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.329
takes care of his children.

01:19:35.454 --> 01:19:37.331
Come on. Come on.

01:19:50.136 --> 01:19:51.846
Gotcha, you bastard!

01:19:54.683 --> 01:19:56.184
Peyton!

01:20:02.066 --> 01:20:03.442
Good.

01:20:09.365 --> 01:20:13.453
Angela, we've gotta get out of here.
It's going to explode!

01:20:17.081 --> 01:20:19.667
Come. Come. Let's go.

01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:23.629
Let's go. Run!

01:20:25.131 --> 01:20:26.507
Run!

01:20:40.063 --> 01:20:44.318
This is a code three. Burn unit
ready. This is a code three.

01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:47.405
- Vital signs OK?
- Yes, Doctor.

01:20:47.488 --> 01:20:48.990
Get her to ER.

01:20:49.115 --> 01:20:52.660
We'll get the best graft
from here, here and here.

01:20:52.743 --> 01:20:54.578
We're not using skin grafts.

01:20:54.662 --> 01:20:57.666
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr Westlake, burn specialist.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:10.428
Everything's going to be OK, Jenny.

01:21:48.677 --> 01:21:51.179
- Dr Westlake?
- I have to go.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.476
Wait.

01:22:14.537 --> 01:22:15.914
Peyton!

01:22:41.732 --> 01:22:43.567
Angela!

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.156
Please, don't follow me.

01:22:48.281 --> 01:22:52.368
I just want to see you...
the way you really are.

01:22:53.577 --> 01:22:56.706
- Why?
- I need to see the man...

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:00.252
the man who saved my child.

01:23:04.089 --> 01:23:06.341
Please.

01:23:36.622 --> 01:23:38.374
Thank you.

01:23:44.506 --> 01:23:48.010
As close as she came,
she was still miles away.

01:23:48.093 --> 01:23:51.138
So I continued my journeys alone -
into the darkness.
