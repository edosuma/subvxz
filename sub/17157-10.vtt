[rock music]

00:09.167 --> 00:11.967
- It's literally the best party
in the history of mankind.

00:11.967 --> 00:14.333
The lacrosse team
only throws it once a year,

00:14.333 --> 00:17.700
because you need a whole year
to recover.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.567
And I hear there's going
to be an eight-layer dip.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.100
Eight layers.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.233
I don't even know what you'd use
for an eighth layer.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.267
It defies the laws of layers.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.267
And this year, they're going
to have a movie screen

00:30.267 --> 00:31.833
that floats in the pool.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.633
I mean, I don't have words.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.667
- Dude, you've actually got
a lot of words.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.533
Like, so many.

00:37.533 --> 00:39.467
But it sounds awesome.
Can I go with you?

00:39.467 --> 00:41.800
- Oh, I'm not invited.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.667
The lacrosse guys
are upperclassmen.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.400
People our age
don't get to go.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.267
None of us are cool enough
to score an invite.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.400
- Sorry. Hang on a sec.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.033
I got to pose for the yearbook.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.100
I was voted best.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.633
- Best what?
- Just best.

00:55.633 --> 00:58.100
- You!
You can get us invited.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.067
You're my cool-haired
golden ticket

01:00.067 --> 01:01.533
to the greatest day of my life.

01:01.533 --> 01:04.800
- Dude, there's way more to me
than just my hair.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.900
I've also got eyes
you can get lost in.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.400
- [sighs]

01:08.400 --> 01:09.833
- How about I just go talk
to those lacrosse dudes?

01:09.833 --> 01:12.233
- What? You can't just walk
over to them.

01:12.233 --> 01:13.633
You need a plan.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.400
- Give me a break, man.
It's only a party.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.800
I'll just ask for an invitation.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.067
- Ask for an invitation?

01:18.067 --> 01:19.867
Just like that?
Yeah.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.900
While you're at it, why don't
you ask for a million dollars

01:21.900 --> 01:23.500
or Rihanna's phone number?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.333
- Relax, man. I got this.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.633
- No, you don't.
- Hey, dudes.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.067
- Do you think
they know it was us?

01:35.067 --> 01:38.333
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

01:38.333 --> 01:40.967
* It all adds up
to one thing *

01:40.967 --> 01:42.500
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.833
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

01:44.833 --> 01:47.667
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

01:47.667 --> 01:50.433
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

01:50.433 --> 01:52.833
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

01:52.833 --> 01:55.567
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

01:55.567 --> 01:58.233
* There's an answer
right in front of you *

01:58.233 --> 02:01.200
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:01.200 --> 02:02.767
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:02.767 --> 02:04.867
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

02:07.067 --> 02:08.567
[rock music]

02:08.567 --> 02:10.800
- There's got to be a way.
- I don't see how.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.833
We're never gonna get an invite
to that party now.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.233
- Who cares
about some older kids' party?

02:15.233 --> 02:16.800
both: We do.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.167
- It's weird when you guys
talk at the same time.

02:19.167 --> 02:21.200
- You guys
talk at the same time, too.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.800
both: No, we don't.
Okay.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.633
We do, but it's cute
when we do it.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.567
- Mm, it's not that cute.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.967
- We're going
to that party, bro.

02:31.967 --> 02:35.067
Like Mr. Finn always says,
never give up.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.633
- I give up.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.067
- What's going on, Mr. Finn?

02:39.067 --> 02:40.967
- Well, the school
bought all the teachers

02:40.967 --> 02:42.667
these fancy new chairs.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.567
It's got
so many thingamajigs,

02:44.567 --> 02:47.167
I don't know
what any of 'em do.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.400
Oh!

02:49.400 --> 02:51.300
- That one makes it recline,

02:51.300 --> 02:53.600
so this is probably
the height adjust.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.533
- Oh!

02:56.533 --> 03:00.067
- Nope. It's unrecline.

03:00.067 --> 03:01.333
That's weird.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.400
On most chairs,
that would be this lever.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.567
- [grunts]

03:06.567 --> 03:09.367
Is there a button on the chair
to call the nurse?

03:11.367 --> 03:13.067
- Don't worry, dude.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.067
I've got the perfect plan to
get us an invite to the party.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.867
You just have to show those guys
how well you play lacrosse.

03:17.867 --> 03:23.100
- That is a perfect plan,
except I can't play lacrosse.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.067
[rock music]

03:25.067 --> 03:27.233
- Why do you have
to meet other people?

03:27.233 --> 03:29.733
Aren't I enough?

03:29.733 --> 03:32.100
But I thought
we had something special.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.500
Forget it.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.400
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.233
- Fighting with your picture
of Freddy again?

03:43.233 --> 03:44.500
- Well, we made up.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.800
- Of course you did.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.433
It's a super healthy
relationship

03:47.433 --> 03:50.833
you have with that picture.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.567
- I can't let Freddy
go to that party.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.600
Until now,
he's been my secret hottie.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.533
All those older girls
are going to be all over him.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.167
I'm gonna lose him, Tomeeks.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.433
- You don't have him.

04:02.433 --> 04:03.800
- That's even worse.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.900
I'm gonna lose him
before I have him.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.500
- Life was so much simpler
when we thought boys were gross.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.900
- Check it out, everybody.

04:10.900 --> 04:15.367
Freddy ate an entire
tuna fish sandwich in one bite.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.633
- He's so cute.

04:16.633 --> 04:19.700
- It came out his nose!

04:19.700 --> 04:21.367
- Yeah, those older girls

04:21.367 --> 04:23.400
are never going
to be able to resist him.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.833
- I know.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.333
[rock music]

04:27.333 --> 04:29.800
- It's gonna take some work
to make you great at lacrosse.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.900
Let me see
how you hold the stick.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.467
Now say,
"I know how to play lacrosse."

04:35.467 --> 04:37.133
- I know how to play lacrosse.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.567
- I buy it.

04:39.567 --> 04:41.667
- Now this is a chair.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.500
A simple, wooden,
four-legged chair

04:44.500 --> 04:46.900
that won't give me
any problems.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.167
Perfect.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.633
But I think the room is tilted.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.067
Ooh, lacrosse!

04:56.067 --> 04:57.200
Let me have a go.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.300
- Mr. Finn, we're kind of busy.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.900
Our social status depends
on Freddy's lacrosse skills.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.900
- Come on.
Oh, man.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.900
I could have been, like,
a regular lacrosse star.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.933
Later, dudes!

05:12.933 --> 05:14.567
both: Later!

05:14.567 --> 05:15.967
[rock music]

05:15.967 --> 05:17.800
- Okay.
Here it goes.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.700
Our chance for glory.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.267
- Don't worry.
I got this.

05:21.267 --> 05:23.067
- Yeah, you do.

05:23.067 --> 05:26.500
And this weekend, we're gonna
be doing our party dance.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.667
both: Oh!
Bring it around town.

05:29.667 --> 05:33.800
Oh.
Oh, Oh, oh!

05:33.800 --> 05:34.967
- Yeah.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.233
- There's no way
Freddy's learned

05:36.233 --> 05:38.400
how to play lacrosse
since yesterday, right?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.433
- Totally, no way.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.200
- He's gonna get invited
to that party.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.167
- Sweet moves, dude.
- It's happening.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.833
This is exactly
what I was worried about.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.800
- Okay. I got this.
I'm gonna do this.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.367
- I need you to push me.
- What?

05:55.367 --> 05:56.433
- Push me.
- I can't.

05:56.433 --> 05:57.567
You're my best friend.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.100
- Aww, Tomeeks, that's so nice.

06:02.067 --> 06:05.733
- Ow. Dude,
quit throwing things at me.

06:10.967 --> 06:12.933
[rock music]

06:19.200 --> 06:22.567
- Mr. Finn, it's a little hard
to concentrate on our math

06:22.567 --> 06:25.533
when you're failing
at woodshop.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.200
- You want a math problem?

06:27.200 --> 06:29.500
If a chair has a leg
that's 2 inches too short

06:29.500 --> 06:32.567
and you measure wrong and cut
4 inches off the other legs,

06:32.567 --> 06:35.067
how long should you cry
before you feel better?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.967
- Well, if it's anything
like seeing some cougar swoop in

06:37.967 --> 06:42.133
and steal your man,
I'd say about four hours.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.967
- We're gonna get through this,
sister.

06:44.967 --> 06:48.400
I'm just gonna
make all the legs even.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.067
- What are we going to do?

06:50.067 --> 06:52.200
You still haven't gotten us
an invitation to that party.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.833
- I know.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.067
Everything keeps going wrong.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.967
- I'm sorry I bumped into you,
Freddy.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.967
I tripped over a crazy person.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.933
- It's okay,
but the party's this weekend,

07:02.933 --> 07:04.300
and we might not get to go.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.633
- Good! I mean darn.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.667
But you'll always have us.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.667
Do you need a hug?

07:10.667 --> 07:12.500
- [clears throat]

07:12.500 --> 07:17.233
Perhaps you need a brilliant
mastermind to help you.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.633
- What?

07:21.533 --> 07:24.267
- [panting]

07:26.400 --> 07:29.567
It's me.
I'm the brilliant mastermind.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.133
- What?

07:31.133 --> 07:34.367
- I know exactly what makes
this place tick socially.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.367
- Since when?

07:36.367 --> 07:38.667
- I've been watching
from the outside every day

07:38.667 --> 07:40.067
since kindergarten.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.900
This school's like
a video game,

07:41.900 --> 07:45.267
and I'm really good
at video games.

07:45.267 --> 07:46.700
Let me guide you.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.767
You're player one,
and I know all the cheat codes.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.067
- Well, it's worth a shot.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.667
- Sounds like a great plan,
guys.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.167
Chair's fixed.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.800
[rock music]

07:58.800 --> 08:00.500
- The key to becoming popular

08:00.500 --> 08:02.900
is you don't start
with the popular kids.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.400
They're too hard to get to.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.233
You need a way to sneak in,
a back door.

08:07.233 --> 08:11.367
In your case, that back door
is going to be George McReedy.

08:11.367 --> 08:15.200
George isn't popular
because he eats his boogs.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.667
But he lives across the street
from Max Peterson,

08:18.667 --> 08:21.400
who is popular
because he doesn't.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.433
You get in with George,
you're in with Max.

08:24.433 --> 08:27.200
And George loves tater tots.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.400
Max's best friend
is Henry Wayne,

08:32.400 --> 08:34.900
and Henry Wayne thinks
he looks like Kevin Durant.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.233
- Hey, this is weird,

08:36.233 --> 08:38.300
but is Kevin Durant
your uncle or something?

08:39.767 --> 08:41.433
- You get Max and Henry
on your side,

08:41.433 --> 08:43.100
and they're going
to talk about you

08:43.100 --> 08:46.100
in front
of Henry's older sister, Maddy.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.900
Now, Maddy's gaga
for Lady Gaga.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.500
[chuckles]
Sorry. Little joke.

08:52.500 --> 08:57.100
Anyway, Maddy--
[chuckles]

08:57.100 --> 08:59.067
Whoo, really got myself
with that one.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.167
- So my mom's friend Gigi
came over.

09:01.167 --> 09:05.900
She's the one who's
Lady Gaga's Pilates instructor.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.833
- Now, Maddy's heard
your name twice,

09:07.833 --> 09:09.800
and she's going
to start talking about you.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.567
High school boys
are like bees.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.967
They do what the queens,
high school girls,

09:13.967 --> 09:17.267
tell them to.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.133
If you follow my plan,

09:19.133 --> 09:23.400
you're going to get more
and more popular each day...

09:29.600 --> 09:32.333
- I'm gonna have to use
both my bumpin' hands.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.867
- Until, finally--

09:36.867 --> 09:38.533
- Hey, Freddy.

09:38.533 --> 09:39.600
Come here.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.800
- Bingo.
You're in.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.967
- We did it.
I'm so proud of us.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.400
- Dude, are you okay?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.800
- I'm so excited,
I can't even fist bump.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.633
- The guys and I
have been talking,

09:55.633 --> 09:58.700
and we decided you're cool.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.567
- You say that like
there's a chart of coolness.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.200
- How does he know
about the chart?

10:04.200 --> 10:07.000
- We're throwing a pretty epic
party this weekend.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.733
Want to come?
- Seriously? Awesome.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.133
My buddy's gonna be so psyched.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.700
He's been wanting
to go to it for years.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.033
- Your buddy?
- Yeah, my friend Zack.

10:14.033 --> 10:15.667
He's right over there.
- Hi, Trey.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.300
This is
my imaginary lacrosse stick.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.933
- Yeah. That guy's not invited.
Only you.

10:22.933 --> 10:26.000
- We're gonna be best friends,
Trey.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.167
- Yeah.
Definitely not him.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.200
[rock music]

10:36.200 --> 10:37.833
- You did it.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.467
We're going to the most awesome
party in the history of ever.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.467
- What can I say?

10:41.467 --> 10:43.267
My system works.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.867
Cool backpack.

10:44.867 --> 10:46.867
By the end of tomorrow,
it'll be mine.

10:46.867 --> 10:50.000
I have work to do.

10:53.733 --> 10:54.867
- Listen, Zack--

10:54.867 --> 10:56.267
- So,
for the pool party situation,

10:56.267 --> 11:00.067
I was thinking
we both need spray tans.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.633
- About the party...

11:01.633 --> 11:03.267
- I should have
never doubted you.

11:03.267 --> 11:06.067
You're the best friend
I've ever had or ever will have.

11:12.167 --> 11:14.800
- What are we gonna do now,
buddy?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.533
- Oh, come on.

11:18.633 --> 11:20.600
[rock music]

11:20.600 --> 11:22.800
- You're like an adorable
little porcupine.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.900
- Cut it out.

11:24.900 --> 11:29.600
- Get your hands off his hair!

11:29.600 --> 11:31.433
I'm gonna take her down.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.633
- Easy, champ.
You're a bleeder.

11:33.633 --> 11:34.933
- [sighs]

11:34.933 --> 11:36.333
I know what to do.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.167
Throw a party on the same night
as the lacrosse team

11:38.167 --> 11:39.667
and make it better
and more epic,

11:39.667 --> 11:41.567
and Freddy will come back to me,
and don't tell me

11:41.567 --> 11:43.767
this isn't going to work because
I really need this to work.

11:43.767 --> 11:47.400
And remember,
I know when you're lying.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.167
- This is going to work.
[chuckles]

11:50.167 --> 11:51.633
- [sighs]
Thanks, Tomeeks.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.300
I really needed
to hear the truth.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.667
[rock music]

11:58.667 --> 12:01.833
Mr. Finn?

12:01.833 --> 12:03.400
- Yes, Summer?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.733
- If we could take a break
from science for just a moment,

12:05.733 --> 12:07.167
I have an announcement.

12:07.167 --> 12:08.867
- Just as long
as I don't have to get up.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.067
I might be a little stuck.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.300
- I'm having an epic party
this Saturday.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.633
Freddy,
here's your invitation.

12:18.633 --> 12:22.633
Of course, I'm hoping the rest
of you can make it, too.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.267
- Sorry, Sum.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.267
Me and my boy Freddy
can't make it,

12:26.267 --> 12:29.433
because we've been invited
to the most awesome party

12:29.433 --> 12:30.867
in history.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.767
- Huh. Yeah.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.533
- Dude, that was weak.

12:35.533 --> 12:38.567
We're gonna have to work
on that before the party.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.500
[rock music]

12:42.667 --> 12:45.233
- Yo, F-Money.
Where are you going?

12:45.233 --> 12:46.833
- I'm just gonna go
sit with my friends.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.467
- Why would you sit on a bench

12:48.467 --> 12:51.300
when you can relax
in a lounge chair?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.967
- Those do look comfortable.

12:52.967 --> 12:57.933
- A little taste of what our big
party's gonna be like, bro.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.133
- Tastes good.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.100
Hey, are you sure
my man Zack can't come?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.300
He's a really cool guy.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.867
- [alien voice]
Take me to your leader.

13:05.867 --> 13:09.067
Take me to your leader.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.333
- I'm sure.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.967
Buddy,
you're the only underclassman

13:11.967 --> 13:15.067
cool enough to be invited.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.400
- Look at that girl
flirting with Freddy

13:16.400 --> 13:18.467
and acting like
he's adorable.

13:18.467 --> 13:21.633
I mean, he is,
but be cool about it.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.100
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh, he's coming over.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.433
Everybody look pretty.

13:24.433 --> 13:26.067
- Hey, guys.
- Freddy!

13:26.067 --> 13:28.067
I mean, hey, Freddy,
what's up?

13:28.067 --> 13:29.233
Did you want to come sit
with us?

13:29.233 --> 13:31.367
Because we can make room.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.333
- Whoa!

13:34.333 --> 13:37.067
What's the matter with you,
woman?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.633
- I just came over for this.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.767
I'm sitting over there with Trey
and the lacrosse guys.

13:40.767 --> 13:41.900
They have lounge chairs.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.067
- Sweet!

13:43.067 --> 13:45.467
Should I join,
get my lounge on?

13:45.467 --> 13:48.567
- Listen, about the party,
I'm sorry, man.

13:48.567 --> 13:51.500
I really tried,
but they say you can't come.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.700
Just me.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.733
- Ah.
That's a bummer.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.600
How'd they take it when you said
you couldn't go without me?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.767
- What?
I mean, I'm still going.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.567
- What?
You can't!

14:00.567 --> 14:02.900
It was my idea to go
to the party in the first place.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.133
- I'm sorry, Zack.
I really did try to get you in.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.067
- No, you didn't.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.200
You want this party
all to yourself.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.767
- Are you calling me a liar?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.867
- What would you call a guy
that betrayed his best friend?

14:12.867 --> 14:14.333
- I didn't betray you.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.067
It's not my fault
they don't want you to come.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.633
You're not gonna
make me feel bad about this.

14:17.633 --> 14:19.833
- Yeah? How do you
feel about this?

14:19.833 --> 14:24.733
both: No!

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
- That's it.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.533
You can call me a liar,

14:29.533 --> 14:32.200
but do not mess
with the hair.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.133
- [scoffs]
Fine.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.933
Go back
to your dumb new friends.

14:35.933 --> 14:38.700
I'll just go
to Summer's terrible party!

14:42.700 --> 14:44.933
Can I bring anything?

14:44.933 --> 14:47.933
[rock music]

14:47.933 --> 14:55.167
*

14:55.167 --> 14:57.067
- Dude, what's the rush?

14:57.067 --> 14:58.833
This is a rock ballad.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.167
That means slow.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.700
- Thank you, Austin!

15:06.700 --> 15:08.067
Sorry, guys. I got to go.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.533
- You're skipping rehearsal?

15:09.533 --> 15:11.467
- Trey's dad
works at a video game company,

15:11.467 --> 15:14.067
so we get to play an advance
copy of "Zombie Flood."

15:14.067 --> 15:16.200
- The one where you play
as the zombie?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.300
In a flood?
Of other zombies?

15:19.300 --> 15:21.533
- Are there going to be donuts?
- Yeah.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.833
both: Can I come?
- Sorry, guys.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.200
Also, I can't play mini-golf
with y'all next weekend.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.300
- What are you doing?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.367
- I'm playing mini-golf...

15:29.367 --> 15:30.767
with the lacrosse dudes.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.533
- Whoa, Freddy.

15:32.533 --> 15:35.633
Sounds like you're really
blowing everybody off.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.800
These people you're letting down
are all your friends.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.067
- Not all of them.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.533
- Why are you staring at me?

15:42.533 --> 15:44.233
- Because you're standing
in front of Zack.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.067
- Oh, phew.

15:49.667 --> 15:50.867
- [scoffs]

15:50.867 --> 15:52.567
We'll never see him again.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.400
Mr. Finn, you've got to get
Freddy to go to my party

15:55.400 --> 15:56.767
for the good of the band.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.633
Oh, and tell him
to wear that cute blue shirt.

15:58.633 --> 16:01.267
Also for the good
of the band.

16:01.267 --> 16:04.133
- Summer, sometimes
you need to set someone free

16:04.133 --> 16:05.433
to get them
to come back to you.

16:05.433 --> 16:06.867
- Wait,
so he's coming back to me?

16:06.867 --> 16:09.233
- No, this isn't
one of those sometimes.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.400
- [sighs]
How can this happen?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.567
Freddy's living my life.

16:13.567 --> 16:16.900
I should be the one blowing
you all off to go to that party.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.100
- Zack's right.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.533
A bit rude,
but this was his dream.

16:21.533 --> 16:25.067
And we owe it to Zack to get him
to that lacrosse party.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.167
I mean, look at him.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.867
It's all he has to live for.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.433
- It's true.

16:30.433 --> 16:32.500
- But we can't go.
We're not invited.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.067
- Pfft.
You don't need an invitation.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.500
I've never been to a party
I was invited to.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.900
Sneaking in
is the funnest part.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.433
Oh, unless there's
a petting zoo.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.233
[rock music]

16:50.100 --> 16:52.600
- F-Money.
- It's time to party!

16:52.600 --> 16:57.233
Oh, oh,
bring it around town!

16:57.233 --> 16:58.700
- What are you doing?

16:58.700 --> 17:02.367
- Uh, just something
I used to do with a friend.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.067
- Yeah.
We don't do that here.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.867
[chuckles]

17:14.767 --> 17:16.500
[rock music]

17:18.933 --> 17:20.067
- I knew it.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.633
Security's tight,

17:21.633 --> 17:24.067
and Trey's probably looking out
for me.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.700
I'll never get in.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.267
- Remember what Mr. Finn said.

17:28.267 --> 17:30.367
- "Stop following me, Lawrence"?

17:30.367 --> 17:32.367
- [sighs]
No.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.367
He said all we need is one of us
to get inside,

17:34.367 --> 17:36.400
then find a window
to sneak Zack in.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.200
We just need a decoy.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.767
Or a bunch of tall decoys.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.067
- What's up, dudes?

17:46.067 --> 17:47.167
Welcome to the party.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.200
Hold up.

17:54.367 --> 17:57.267
- Hey, I'm Bob
from the lacrosse team.

17:57.267 --> 18:00.133
Let's get our party on, bro.

18:00.133 --> 18:02.867
[grunts]

18:02.867 --> 18:04.567
Okay.

18:04.567 --> 18:07.267
Those guys are good.

18:07.267 --> 18:08.700
- We don't have to sneak in.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.567
If we want to get inside,
we just have to be cool.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.433
[doorbell rings]

18:20.600 --> 18:23.067
[gasps]
I think I see Freddy! Freddy!

18:23.067 --> 18:24.967
Freddy! Hi, Freddy!
Freddy!

18:24.967 --> 18:27.733
Hi, Freddy!

18:27.733 --> 18:30.367
- She doesn't seem
very cool.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.467
- [screams]

18:36.500 --> 18:37.867
- This stinks.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.100
- It's no big deal.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.200
I'm sure
this party's all hype anyway.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.700
- Yeah.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.133
- An alpaca?

18:52.133 --> 18:54.833
Get us in there, woman.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.433
Okay, guys.
As soon as I get over the fence,

18:59.433 --> 19:01.767
I'll open up the gate
and let you in.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.300
This is gonna be awesome.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.800
That was awesome.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.933
- Guys, this gate
was unlocked the whole time.

19:20.433 --> 19:23.567
[party horns blowing
and clatter]

19:24.900 --> 19:26.067
- Oh!
- Ah!

19:26.067 --> 19:28.833
This is cashmere!

19:28.833 --> 19:31.200
- Whoa!

19:31.200 --> 19:33.067
- [grunts]

19:36.500 --> 19:37.833
- I-I got this.

19:44.167 --> 19:47.500
- Best six seconds of my life.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.200
- It was even better
than I thought it would be.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.700
I wish it didn't end.

19:52.700 --> 19:56.700
- I think I won
a limbo contest.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.067
- Thanks for trying, guys,
but it's not gonna happen.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.167
- It's okay.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.700
We can all say
we were at the party,

20:02.700 --> 20:05.033
and no one can ever take
those memories away from us.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.200
- What?
- What?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.767
[stammering]

20:09.967 --> 20:12.933
- I hate those guys.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.600
[rock music]

20:15.600 --> 20:17.767
- Guys, we're gonna have
as much fun at my party

20:17.767 --> 20:19.267
as Freddy's having
at his party.

20:19.267 --> 20:20.900
- Do you have an alpaca?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.167
- No, but I have a cat
that bites.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.600
- Good enough.
- Freddy!

20:26.600 --> 20:27.667
What are you doing here?

20:27.667 --> 20:29.233
- I looked inside the party,

20:29.233 --> 20:31.300
and I saw everyone having
a good time with their friends,

20:31.300 --> 20:34.100
and I realized I want to have
a good time with my friends.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.833
- Aww.

20:35.833 --> 20:39.067
- I'm glad you're back, Freddy.
I'm raiding your fridge.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.533
- Can't believe
you skipped the good party.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.900
- I didn't.
I'm at the good party.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.467
Hey, giant sandwich?

20:53.467 --> 20:55.667
- Whoa, dude!

20:55.667 --> 20:57.067
Thanks.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.767
- They couldn't fit it all
through the house!

20:58.767 --> 21:03.200
That was the section that was
sticking out of the window.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.733
Sorry we had a fight.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.367
- Sorry I messed
with your hair.

21:09.567 --> 21:10.967
- Party dance?

21:13.300 --> 21:16.767
both: Oh!
Bring it around town!

21:16.767 --> 21:19.067
Oh, oh!

21:19.067 --> 21:21.700
- Does that get you over him?
both: Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

21:21.700 --> 21:22.933
- No.
both: Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.667
Oh! Oh!
