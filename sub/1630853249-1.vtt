WEBVTT

00:02.057 --> 00:03.754
Who exactly
is your client?

00:03.798 --> 00:05.843
Jorge De Guzman.

00:05.887 --> 00:08.020
I quit Schweikart & Cokely.

00:08.063 --> 00:10.979
Pro bono means no money,
so what's the plan here?

00:11.023 --> 00:14.635
Put your phone down
so I can hear.

00:14.678 --> 00:16.376
Tell me what happened.

00:16.419 --> 00:19.118
You have bigger problems than
if you trust Saul Goodman.

00:20.032 --> 00:21.381
Change of plans.

00:21.424 --> 00:22.860
I think we should
get out of here.

00:22.904 --> 00:24.297
He took Varga with him.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.081
We should find a way
to pull him out of there.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.431
He's earned
some consideration.

00:28.475 --> 00:31.173
He's a man
on the inside.

00:31.217 --> 00:35.525
Our actions
must be unimpeachable.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.876
Lalo Salamanca
is going to die.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.096
So we're safe?
Yeah.

00:46.014 --> 00:49.931
What if Howard does something
terrible, like misconduct?

00:49.974 --> 00:51.715
You know what that'd mean
for Sandpiper?

00:51.759 --> 00:53.500
You could help a lot of people.
I-I get it.

00:53.543 --> 00:55.632
But you would not
be okay with it.

00:55.676 --> 00:56.807
Wouldn't I?

08:20.381 --> 08:21.556
Yeah.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.645
Where are you?

08:23.689 --> 08:25.473
I don't know.

08:25.517 --> 08:27.562
I don't know.
I've been --

08:28.911 --> 08:31.348
I've been heading north
for about two hours.

08:31.392 --> 08:33.481
I crossed a river
maybe an hour ago.

08:33.525 --> 08:34.874
Anybody see you?

08:34.917 --> 08:37.311
No.
Keep it that way.

08:37.354 --> 08:39.487
You're in
Salamanca territory.

08:39.531 --> 08:41.663
Everybody's gonna be
on the lookout for you.

08:41.707 --> 08:43.447
And I mean everybody.

08:43.491 --> 08:46.494
That includes
the Federales.

08:48.627 --> 08:50.367
Is it done?

08:50.411 --> 08:52.674
Yeah. He's dead.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.769
There were some, uh,

09:00.813 --> 09:03.467
regular people
at that house.

09:03.511 --> 09:04.730
Some old folks.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.428
What about them?

09:07.471 --> 09:08.908
Got no information
on that.

09:08.951 --> 09:10.910
When we hang up,

09:10.953 --> 09:12.694
take the battery
outta your phone.

09:12.738 --> 09:15.131
Head north.
Stay out of sight.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.960
I'm fixing up a place
for you to lie low.

09:18.004 --> 09:20.136
In an hour, you put
the battery back in.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.877
And I'll call you,
tell you where to go.

10:00.176 --> 10:02.483
Don Eduardo!

10:33.035 --> 10:35.516
Ahh.

10:41.827 --> 10:44.177
Don Eduardo!

10:53.055 --> 10:55.275
ZZ?

11:05.285 --> 11:07.026
Hey, Mateo.

11:49.155 --> 11:50.591
No.

13:38.003 --> 13:40.614
Hey.Hey.

13:41.658 --> 13:43.835
So, uh,
what's on the agenda?

13:43.878 --> 13:45.575
Uh, well,

13:45.619 --> 13:48.622
I just got 20 new clients
from Grant, so...

13:48.665 --> 13:50.102
Twenty.
Yeah.

13:50.145 --> 13:52.756
I have meetings
with four of them this afternoon

13:52.800 --> 13:55.585
and a preliminary hearing
with Flaherty first thing.

13:55.629 --> 13:57.979
Juvenile.
What about you?

13:58.023 --> 14:00.721
Mm.

14:00.764 --> 14:02.375
Same thing.

14:02.418 --> 14:04.681
Huge day.

14:05.944 --> 14:08.207
Yes, your mother
and your grandmother.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.645
If they can take time off
from work, both of them...

14:11.688 --> 14:15.431
Do you have
any uncles or...

14:15.475 --> 14:18.347
Oh, yeah.
That would be great.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.872
Do you have anything nice
to wear...?

14:22.482 --> 14:24.527
Like a sports coat
or a...

14:24.571 --> 14:26.138
Hey.

14:26.181 --> 14:27.966
A collared shirt...?

14:28.009 --> 14:29.445
You know what?

14:29.489 --> 14:30.794
I'll bring something
for you.

14:30.838 --> 14:32.100
That's too nice.

14:32.144 --> 14:34.537
No. It's no problem.

14:34.581 --> 14:36.670
Do you know
how to get there?

14:36.713 --> 14:38.628
Tijeras and Fifth.
That's right.

14:38.672 --> 14:40.239
Yes.
Alright.

14:40.282 --> 14:42.197
I will meet you
at30 sharp.

14:42.241 --> 14:45.026
It's gonna be fine,
Ronnie.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.594
Well, tell them
it's gonna be fine.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.683
Because it will be.

14:49.726 --> 14:52.033
Okay.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.384
Thanks.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.909
I'll bring it
back clean.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.000
Do you have any cash
for the taxi?

15:07.527 --> 15:10.008
Crap, all's I've got
is five bucks.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.883
Um...

15:32.813 --> 15:35.120
You think the cabbie'll
break a hundred?

19:26.133 --> 19:27.700
Good morning, Don Juan.

19:27.743 --> 19:30.224
Lalo Salamanca
is dead.

19:30.268 --> 19:32.661
Gunmen broke into his hacienda
last night.

19:32.705 --> 19:36.361
Hired operators
from the look of it.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.798
It was messy.
Very messy.

19:38.841 --> 19:40.234
As for the Salamancas...

19:40.278 --> 19:42.193
"Sangre por sangre."

19:42.236 --> 19:45.631
Yes.
That is the Salamanca way.

19:45.674 --> 19:47.807
We are on the verge
of chaos.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.983
But who did this?

19:50.026 --> 19:52.072
One minute, I hear talk
of the Colombians,

19:52.115 --> 19:54.161
the next...traitors.

19:54.205 --> 19:56.032
Traitors close to home.

19:56.076 --> 19:57.425
We know this much.

19:57.469 --> 19:58.774
Ignacio Varga is a rat.

19:58.818 --> 20:01.037
Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.

20:01.081 --> 20:03.388
Every man we have
is searching for him.

20:03.431 --> 20:07.218
When Varga's found, we'll know
who he was working for.

20:09.176 --> 20:12.005
I assume Don Hector
has been told.

20:12.048 --> 20:13.441
I called him myself.

20:13.485 --> 20:16.183
As for if he understood me,
quiÃ©n sabe.

20:16.836 --> 20:18.272
Listen to me.

20:18.316 --> 20:20.753
You must be careful,
Gustavo.

20:20.796 --> 20:22.233
This is
a dangerous time.

20:22.276 --> 20:25.192
No one
is above suspicion.

20:25.236 --> 20:26.715
I understand.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.760
Good.

20:55.135 --> 20:56.963
Tell me again
about the sicario

20:57.006 --> 20:59.487
who made the final report.

20:59.531 --> 21:01.968
He was already wounded
when he talked to our cut-out.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.362
Federales found him
dead at the scene.

21:04.405 --> 21:06.015
But they got Salamanca.

21:06.059 --> 21:09.454
The mercenaries
are dead.

21:09.497 --> 21:10.846
To a man.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.632
And yet their mission
was a success.

21:16.156 --> 21:19.246
It has been known
to happen.

21:19.290 --> 21:23.598
I could go down there and
get Varga, bring him home safe.

21:23.642 --> 21:25.818
There's ways to do it
on the quiet.

21:33.565 --> 21:36.916
Unless you already have
something in the works.

21:53.498 --> 21:55.456
Speak your mind.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.980
Loyalty goes
both ways.

21:58.024 --> 22:00.983
Varga has done everything
you asked him.

22:01.027 --> 22:03.464
He wasn't given a choice.Maybe so.

22:03.508 --> 22:07.599
But he played a tough game
and he played it on the square.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.819
And?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.995
When all is said
and done...

22:13.039 --> 22:15.781
The kid deserves
your respect.

22:18.653 --> 22:19.959
He has it.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.615
Is there more
you wish to say?

22:53.296 --> 22:56.561
I hope this brings your guy
more luck than it brought me.

22:59.302 --> 23:00.913
You good?

23:00.956 --> 23:02.088
I'm great.

23:24.806 --> 23:26.895
Detective!
Miss Khalil.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.158
Good morning.

23:29.202 --> 23:30.812
I've been calling you
for two days.

23:30.856 --> 23:32.858
Oh.
My girl's out sick.

23:32.901 --> 23:34.250
What can I do you for?

23:34.294 --> 23:36.035
Tomorrow morning.
00 a.m.

23:36.078 --> 23:38.472
Brunch?
With just you and me, right?

23:38.516 --> 23:40.909
I mean, won't the big fella here
feel like a third wheel?

23:40.953 --> 23:44.043
You and I are meeting Parson
in chambers.

23:44.086 --> 23:46.088
I am asking
for an emergency hearing

23:46.132 --> 23:48.308
to alter the terms
of De Guzman's release.

23:48.351 --> 23:50.092
Sounds like a blast.

23:50.136 --> 23:52.530
Unfortunately,
I'm booked solid.

23:52.573 --> 23:54.967
I checked your client's
place of residence.

23:55.010 --> 23:56.185
The address he gave?

23:56.229 --> 23:58.187
It's a Dairy Queen
in Alta Monte.

23:58.231 --> 24:01.408
The family that showed at the
bail hearing can't be located.

24:01.452 --> 24:03.541
No driver's license,
no tax rolls,

24:03.584 --> 24:05.456
no school records.
Nothing.

24:05.499 --> 24:07.893
Fact is, there isn't
a single Elizabeth McKinnon

24:07.936 --> 24:11.374
under the age of 73
living in New Mexico.

24:11.418 --> 24:14.203
Well, this is --
this is surprising.

24:14.247 --> 24:15.770
Your client
has disappeared,

24:15.814 --> 24:18.381
and I'm not waiting six weeks
to start looking for him.

24:18.425 --> 24:21.428
Hey, my guy put up
seven million in bail.

24:21.472 --> 24:23.212
You think he's just
gonna walk away from that?

24:23.256 --> 24:25.476
Who comes up with
seven million bucks in cash?

24:25.519 --> 24:26.999
You know what I think?

24:27.042 --> 24:29.175
I think
the family was fake,

24:29.218 --> 24:31.090
and I think you knew it
the whole time.

24:31.133 --> 24:33.788
Hold on. Look, just get real
for a second.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.224
The hearing
didn't go your way,

24:35.268 --> 24:36.835
and now you're trying
for a do-over.

24:36.878 --> 24:38.489
You say my guy ran?

24:38.532 --> 24:40.752
I say he's got seven million
reasons for showing up --

24:40.795 --> 24:43.145
when he's legally required
to do so.

24:43.189 --> 24:44.625
So, no,

24:44.669 --> 24:47.889
I won't be, uh,
due process window dressing

24:47.933 --> 24:50.152
at any crash meeting
with Parson.

24:50.196 --> 24:52.415
And if you try throwing
any of this crap around

24:52.459 --> 24:54.461
in front the judge
without my presence --

24:54.505 --> 24:55.897
here's an accusation.

24:55.941 --> 24:57.943
Prosecutorial
misconduct.

24:57.986 --> 25:00.511
Career-ending
prosecutorial misconduct.

25:00.554 --> 25:02.251
None of that changes the fact

25:02.295 --> 25:04.819
the guy's not
who he said he was.No, no, no. Hold on.

25:04.863 --> 25:06.734
You guys got caught with
your pants around your ankles

25:06.778 --> 25:07.996
and somehow
that's on me?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.345
I don't think so.

25:09.389 --> 25:11.173
You've got two dozen lawyers
up there,

25:11.217 --> 25:13.828
you got investigators, you got
the whole damn police force --

25:13.872 --> 25:15.917
and it's my fault
you can't keep track of Lalo?

25:15.961 --> 25:17.266
That is not my job!

25:17.310 --> 25:19.660
Lalo?
Who's Lalo?

25:19.704 --> 25:22.010
What?
What did I say?

25:23.751 --> 25:26.841
I meant De Guzman.
I have more than one client.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.887
So

25:28.930 --> 25:31.629
I will see you at
the preliminary in six weeks.

25:31.672 --> 25:33.587
As scheduled.

25:33.631 --> 25:36.198
Until then,
I have clients who need me.

26:29.295 --> 26:30.949
Nice threads.

26:30.992 --> 26:32.994
Uh, thanks.

26:37.999 --> 26:39.305
Hey.
Hey.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.655
How'd it go?

26:41.699 --> 26:43.962
The suit
definitely helped.

26:45.398 --> 26:49.576
This kid,
he's a high school senior,

26:49.620 --> 26:51.839
good grades,
works two jobs.

26:51.883 --> 26:56.496
Has this so-called "friend" --
some snot-nosed brat

26:56.539 --> 26:58.629
who drives a brand-new
Mustang convertible.

26:58.672 --> 27:00.282
One Saturday night
Richie Rich says,

27:00.326 --> 27:02.067
"Hey, you wanna
drive my car?"

27:02.110 --> 27:03.808
How can my guy resist?

27:03.851 --> 27:05.766
The "friend" tells him
to pull over at a liquor store.

27:05.810 --> 27:09.683
Rich kid goes in, robs the place
with his uncle's Bowie knife.

27:09.727 --> 27:11.424
No.Yeah.

27:11.467 --> 27:13.078
My guy's out in the Mustang
playing with the radio --

27:13.121 --> 27:14.427
he's got no idea.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.734
Rich kid comes out
with $425 in cash,

27:16.777 --> 27:18.387
a bottle of Jagermeister.

27:18.431 --> 27:20.955
Tells my guy to floor it.
Which he does. Happily.

27:20.999 --> 27:23.131
Because he's completely
in the dark about the robbery.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.004
Yeah, but when they pick them
up, your kid is driving --

27:26.047 --> 27:27.179
He's driving!Of course he's driving.

27:27.222 --> 27:28.833
Yes!

27:28.876 --> 27:30.356
My guy ends up
with the public defender.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.838
Rich kid's family brings in
a top-dollar defense

27:33.881 --> 27:37.058
from out-of-state,
if you can believe it, Denver.

27:37.102 --> 27:39.408
And they're trying to dump
the whole thing on my guy.

27:39.452 --> 27:41.106
It was my client's idea,

27:41.149 --> 27:44.370
he was forcing the rich kid
into it -- the whole deal.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.067
Oakley's going for
aggravated robbery and assault.

27:46.111 --> 27:48.069
Oakley? That dick.Yeah.

27:48.113 --> 27:50.115
But your kid was never
even inside the store!

27:50.158 --> 27:52.334
Flaherty forced joinder --

27:52.378 --> 27:55.729
but I -- I think
I can make it work for us.

27:55.773 --> 27:57.252
Trial's next month.

27:57.296 --> 27:59.820
This was really good.
Have some.

27:59.864 --> 28:01.735
You want anything?
Uh...

28:01.779 --> 28:02.823
You should definitely
try these.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.651
Uh, yeah, sure.
Excuse me,

28:04.695 --> 28:07.088
can we get a menu and another
order of sopaipillas?

28:07.132 --> 28:09.482
You got it.Thank you.

28:09.525 --> 28:11.353
And then there was
a homeless woman

28:11.397 --> 28:13.878
that I had to
get out of MDC.

28:13.921 --> 28:15.923
That's another story.

28:15.967 --> 28:19.753
Sounds like the day from hell.

28:19.797 --> 28:21.929
It was one of the best days
of my life.

28:24.584 --> 28:28.153
My professional life.

28:28.196 --> 28:30.808
How about you?

28:30.851 --> 28:33.288
I...rented us a car.

28:33.332 --> 28:36.335
It's -- It's the Ford.

28:36.378 --> 28:40.948
So, Saul Goodman drives
a brown Ford Taurus?

28:40.992 --> 28:43.821
Detroit calls that taupe,
I believe.

28:43.864 --> 28:45.518
Don't you think
Saul Goodman

28:45.561 --> 28:50.044
would drive something
with a little more...flair?

28:50.088 --> 28:52.220
Such as...?
I don't know.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.396
Definitely American-made.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.269
Something showy.

28:57.312 --> 29:01.795
And Saul Goodman
has an office.

29:01.839 --> 29:04.929
Something eye-catching,
good location.

29:04.972 --> 29:05.973
By the courthouse?

29:06.017 --> 29:07.758
Yeah!

29:07.801 --> 29:09.281
A cathedral of justice.

29:09.324 --> 29:12.066
Oooooh.
A cathedral of justice.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.938
Okay. Yeah.

29:13.981 --> 29:16.767
We should start looking
for something for you --

29:16.810 --> 29:18.812
I mean for "Saul."

29:18.856 --> 29:21.206
Sold!
When do we start?

29:21.249 --> 29:23.077
Saturday's good.

29:23.121 --> 29:24.296
Saturday it is.

29:33.174 --> 29:36.830
I was thinking about
our first move.

29:36.874 --> 29:38.092
On the Howard front.

29:40.312 --> 29:43.141
I think there's a way
to get Sandpiper settled

29:43.184 --> 29:44.795
and leave him standing --

29:44.838 --> 29:47.275
bruised, maybe,
but still standing.

29:47.319 --> 29:51.453
Maybe the trick is, we're not
working on Howard, not at first.

29:51.497 --> 29:54.892
Maybe we start
with Cliff Main.

29:54.935 --> 29:57.416
So, uh...

29:57.459 --> 29:58.852
We're doing that?

30:01.115 --> 30:03.117
I thought we were.
Aren't we?

30:03.161 --> 30:04.771
Wh--

30:04.815 --> 30:07.165
You think we shouldn't.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.080
Well, I-I didn't
say that.

30:09.123 --> 30:10.385
Um...

30:12.910 --> 30:15.695
Here we are.

30:15.738 --> 30:17.392
Did you decide
on anything?

30:17.436 --> 30:18.916
Oh, not yet.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.961
Can I get you a drink
while you're thinking about it?

30:21.005 --> 30:23.877
Uh, yeah. A Coke.
Thanks.

30:36.194 --> 30:38.457
All right.
Here you go.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.893
Okay.

30:46.813 --> 30:50.991
So, the, uh --

30:51.035 --> 30:53.515
the Howard thing.

30:53.559 --> 30:55.909
What --
What were you thinking?

30:59.608 --> 31:01.915
You sure?

31:01.959 --> 31:03.177
Yeah.

31:03.221 --> 31:05.179
What's the harm
in listening?

31:08.052 --> 31:10.315
Well...

31:10.358 --> 31:13.448
it has to
be paced right.

31:13.492 --> 31:16.843
We move too fast,
they'll see us coming.

31:16.887 --> 31:19.324
And it has to make sense.

31:19.367 --> 31:20.847
It doesn't have to
stand up in court,

31:20.891 --> 31:23.676
but there has to be a reason
for everything.

35:14.820 --> 35:16.517
Yeah.

35:16.561 --> 35:17.823
I'm at the motel.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.868
No one saw me
but the lady who runs it.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.827
Alright. We're working on
getting you out.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.481
It's gonna take
a couple of days.

35:23.524 --> 35:25.352
I'll call you
when our guys are set up.

35:25.396 --> 35:27.311
They're gonna be driving
a farm truck.

35:27.354 --> 35:29.182
When they pass you,
jump in the back.

35:29.226 --> 35:31.880
It's gonna happen fast,
they're not gonna wait for you.

35:31.924 --> 35:34.187
There's some clothes
in the closet -- wear them.

35:36.276 --> 35:38.670
What happens
between now and then?

35:38.713 --> 35:40.585
Stay out of sight.

35:40.628 --> 35:42.891
Eladio put a price
on your head.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.720
Anyone comes through that door,
you shoot.

35:45.764 --> 35:47.287
You got it?

35:50.421 --> 35:51.509
Yeah.

36:44.779 --> 36:46.303
Here you go.

36:47.304 --> 36:48.435
Thanks!

36:48.479 --> 36:50.307
See, you build it
too high,

36:50.350 --> 36:52.657
your marble's gonna
run off the track.

36:52.700 --> 36:54.136
It's not finished.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.704
When it's finished,
it'll work.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.097
Okay.

36:59.794 --> 37:01.231
May I please have
some more lemonade?

37:01.274 --> 37:04.059
No. You drank about
a gallon already.

37:04.103 --> 37:06.410
Please, Pop-pop.

37:08.325 --> 37:10.892
Alright.
One more and that's it.

37:10.936 --> 37:12.764
Thank you, Pop-pop!

37:54.675 --> 37:57.504
Three.

37:57.548 --> 38:00.507
Four.

38:00.551 --> 38:02.466
Five.

38:04.206 --> 38:05.991
Six.

38:15.914 --> 38:17.307
Oh, wait.

38:19.134 --> 38:21.006
There they are.

38:24.096 --> 38:25.663
Oh, yeah.

38:25.706 --> 38:29.101
Okay.
They're on the fourth hole.

38:29.144 --> 38:30.363
Assuming they're
playing nine,

38:30.407 --> 38:34.498
that should give you
about 45 minutes safely.

38:36.674 --> 38:38.632
You gotta teach me
to play golf.

38:38.676 --> 38:41.374
A lawyer should be able
to play golf.

38:41.418 --> 38:42.636
Any time.

38:49.121 --> 38:50.340
You all right?

38:51.819 --> 38:53.125
Yep.

38:53.168 --> 38:54.431
Piece of cake.

39:27.377 --> 39:31.729
Excuse me, sir.
Are you a member or a guest?

39:31.772 --> 39:33.644
I'm just here
for a tour.

39:33.687 --> 39:35.210
Ah. Welcome.

39:35.254 --> 39:36.821
Front desk
is straight ahead.

39:39.693 --> 39:41.303
Hi. I called
about a tour?

39:41.347 --> 39:43.915
Oh, if you'll follow me
to the members' lounge?

39:51.575 --> 39:53.446
Hi. Norm Wakely.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.969
I understand you're
in the market for a tour?

39:55.013 --> 39:56.971
That's right.
Saul Goodman.

39:57.015 --> 39:58.495
Great to meet you,
Mr. Goodman.

39:58.538 --> 40:00.627
Ah, please, call me Saul.Great.

40:00.671 --> 40:03.630
So, Saul, can I get you anything
before we get started?

40:03.674 --> 40:05.719
The coffee here
is just unbeatable.

40:05.763 --> 40:07.373
Uh, well, I'm fine.

40:07.417 --> 40:08.983
I'm fully caffeinated.

40:09.027 --> 40:14.336
Well, Saul, you and I are
standing on hallowed ground.

40:14.380 --> 40:16.730
Five Presidents have played
on our course...

40:16.774 --> 40:19.037
...starting with
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.474
But the story goes back
even further than that --

40:21.518 --> 40:24.521
Norm, can I have a sec, please?

40:24.564 --> 40:26.479
Kevin, hey,
how's it going?

40:26.523 --> 40:29.569
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sure
this'll just be a moment.

40:43.148 --> 40:46.368
Mr. Goodman,
I'm so sorry.

40:46.412 --> 40:49.502
But I've just been reminded
that, in fact,

40:49.546 --> 40:51.112
we have a two-year
waiting list.

40:51.156 --> 40:52.810
Two years. Wow.

40:54.681 --> 40:58.424
Maybe I could, uh,
go on the tour anyway,

40:58.468 --> 41:00.339
I mean, 'cause I'm here,
just in case.

41:00.382 --> 41:02.950
Well, unfortunately,
we suspended tours.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.125
For the moment.

41:04.169 --> 41:05.736
You're not even
giving tours?

41:05.779 --> 41:08.042
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

41:08.086 --> 41:11.176
We will be happy to call you
if the situation changes.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.091
You left your number?Uh-huh.

41:13.134 --> 41:14.658
Well, we'll be in touch.

41:14.701 --> 41:17.487
If the situation changes.

41:17.530 --> 41:20.185
Again, I-I'm sorry for your time
and trouble.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.882
Uh, we just --
Oh, God.

41:21.926 --> 41:24.711
We had a few
crossed wires.

41:24.755 --> 41:26.844
Well...

41:26.887 --> 41:28.236
okay then.

41:29.411 --> 41:30.717
Thank you.

41:41.380 --> 41:42.903
I'm sorry.
One second.
Yes?

41:42.947 --> 41:45.863
Um, just so I understand,
you were gonna give me a tour

41:45.906 --> 41:48.343
and then you realized
you don't need new members?

41:48.387 --> 41:50.041
We have a waiting list.

41:50.084 --> 41:51.477
Okay, but you're
the membership director,

41:51.521 --> 41:52.957
so you would have
known that before.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.785
I know.It doesn't really add up.

41:54.828 --> 41:57.744
I mean, I came in, and everyone
was rolling out the red carpet

41:57.788 --> 42:00.225
and then, all of a sudden
something changed...

42:00.268 --> 42:01.356
I don't...

42:01.400 --> 42:02.488
Mr. Goodman,
I am the --

42:02.532 --> 42:03.924
Goodman!
The name.

42:03.968 --> 42:07.275
The second you heard it,
everything turned on a dime.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.626
Waiting list?

42:09.669 --> 42:12.019
I think you're talking about
an exclusion list.

42:12.063 --> 42:15.501
It's okay. It's -- I should have
known because, I mean, look.

42:15.545 --> 42:17.677
It's wall to wall mayonnaise
in here!

42:17.721 --> 42:19.940
So, you know, listen,
if you're gonna be restricted,

42:19.984 --> 42:21.507
have the courage
to say so.

42:21.551 --> 42:23.596
There's no question of --Here it is, folks!

42:23.640 --> 42:26.686
Anti-Semitism! Alive and well
right here in Albuquerque.

42:26.730 --> 42:29.210
Sir, we have many
Jewish members --

42:29.254 --> 42:31.256
Oh, good.
Well, you met your quota then.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.562
Gold star for you.

42:32.605 --> 42:33.998
Hold on!

42:34.041 --> 42:36.566
That's gotta be the biggest
load of horse crap

42:36.609 --> 42:38.219
I've ever heard
in my life.

42:38.263 --> 42:41.440
Go crawl back in your hole,
McGill or Goodman,

42:41.483 --> 42:42.746
whatever you're
calling yourself.

42:42.789 --> 42:45.096
What're you up to,
anyway?

42:45.139 --> 42:47.751
Ginning up another one
of your put-up job lawsuits,

42:47.794 --> 42:50.014
you two-faced, blackmailing,
money-grubbing son-of-a-bitch --

42:50.057 --> 42:51.581
"Money-grubbing!"

42:51.624 --> 42:53.495
You're saying the quiet part
out loud, I think.

42:53.539 --> 42:55.149
Gentlemen, can we just
keep the volume down?

42:55.193 --> 42:56.977
You know damn well
that's not what I meant --

42:57.021 --> 42:58.457
In this day and age?

42:58.500 --> 42:59.937
I had hoped and prayed
we'd be beyond this.

42:59.980 --> 43:02.374
You're 'bout as Jewish
as my Aunt Fannie --

43:02.417 --> 43:05.290
Five thousand years
and it never ends.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.857
Here it is --
violence!

43:06.900 --> 43:08.380
It always comes to this!

43:08.423 --> 43:09.990
Mr. Wachtell, please!

43:10.034 --> 43:11.383
Come on, Kev.

43:11.426 --> 43:13.864
Go to hell,
you lying sack of shit.

43:16.736 --> 43:20.348
Sir, Mr. Goodman...
I don't know what to say.

43:20.392 --> 43:23.047
That is not --I wouldn't be a member here.

43:23.090 --> 43:25.397
I wouldn't walk through
those doors again

43:25.440 --> 43:27.660
after what happened
to me here today.

43:32.099 --> 43:37.104
Do you at least have a bathroom
that I could use,

43:37.148 --> 43:40.194
seeing as how my --

43:40.238 --> 43:43.633
Stress like that is hell
on my diverticulitis.

43:43.676 --> 43:45.199
The men's locker room
is the closest.

43:45.243 --> 43:46.592
It's straight
through there.

43:46.636 --> 43:48.028
And I would be allowed
to go in there?

43:48.072 --> 43:50.857
Yes. Of course.

43:50.901 --> 43:53.643
I want you to know
I don't blame you personally.

43:53.686 --> 43:55.732
I know you're just
following orders.

43:55.775 --> 43:58.343
It's okay, folks!
I'm leaving.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.692
All is well.

44:10.834 --> 44:12.183
Good morning, sir.Morning.

45:09.980 --> 45:12.983
Shit. Shit.
Shit. Shit. Shit.

45:21.687 --> 45:24.821
I swear it's nothing I did, but,
uh, one of your toilets is --

45:24.864 --> 45:26.039
I'll take care
of it, sir.

45:26.083 --> 45:27.693
Okay.
It's the middle one.

45:27.737 --> 45:30.304
You can't miss it.Yeah. No -- No problem, sir!

45:58.985 --> 46:01.509
227.

46:01.553 --> 46:03.511
227.

46:20.572 --> 46:22.879
I was losing, Howard.
You put me out of my misery.

46:22.922 --> 46:24.489
Well,
you might not have lost.

46:24.532 --> 46:25.707
Your swing was good.

46:25.751 --> 46:27.231
No better than last time
we played.

46:27.274 --> 46:28.972
Well, keep your head down,
you'll get better.

46:29.015 --> 46:31.583
Anyway, on the topic
of your hiring binge --

46:31.626 --> 46:32.802
Hardly a "binge."

46:32.845 --> 46:34.281
What would you
call it?

46:34.325 --> 46:36.588
I'd call it
"prudent expansion."

46:36.631 --> 46:38.808
We're not headhunting
any of your associates,

46:38.851 --> 46:40.635
if that's what
you're worried about.Okay.

46:40.679 --> 46:42.333
Need a towel?Sure.

46:46.380 --> 46:47.642
Hey.

46:47.686 --> 46:49.775
Hey.

46:49.819 --> 46:51.864
Listen, on the QT,

46:51.908 --> 46:54.867
I'd be particularly careful
with any lateral hires...

46:54.911 --> 46:56.477
You talking
about what's-his-name,

46:56.521 --> 46:57.739
the guy from Tennessee?

46:57.783 --> 46:59.263
You hear something?

46:59.306 --> 47:02.266
Nothing I'd care to repeat.
Just "trust, but verify."

47:02.309 --> 47:03.745
Fair enough.

47:05.225 --> 47:06.574
Howard...?
What?

47:16.062 --> 47:18.412
Uh, this can't be...

47:18.456 --> 47:20.501
Sure looks like it.

47:20.545 --> 47:22.460
Really?

47:22.503 --> 47:25.506
Not the first time I've seen
one of those. Unfortunately.

47:25.550 --> 47:28.335
Well, where did it
come from?

47:28.379 --> 47:30.294
Didn't it just fall
out of your locker?

47:31.861 --> 47:34.602
I don't see how...

47:34.646 --> 47:36.866
You don't think one of
the members could have...

47:38.693 --> 47:40.739
Maybe somebody on staff.

47:48.921 --> 47:50.967
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

47:55.710 --> 47:58.670
Oh, my G--

48:02.195 --> 48:03.501
Where were you?

48:03.544 --> 48:05.677
I'll tell you later.
Here they come.

48:08.462 --> 48:09.986
Did they find it?

48:10.029 --> 48:13.163
Yes.

48:13.206 --> 48:16.775
What if they figure out
it's baby powder?

48:16.818 --> 48:18.385
They won't.

48:25.218 --> 48:28.265
I think maybe
we outsmarted ourselves.

48:29.831 --> 48:34.097
Maybe this was all...
too subtle.

48:34.140 --> 48:37.927
Nope. Not too subtle.

48:37.970 --> 48:40.103
Perfect.

49:09.784 --> 49:13.136
Andale.Chop, chop.
We don't got all day, folks.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.221
Dos mil.

50:27.384 --> 50:29.429
I'm gonna need a minute.

50:29.473 --> 50:31.475
Nobody's waiting for you,
big stuff.

50:31.518 --> 50:33.955
Come on.
Be nice.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.374
Hello. Casa Tranquila.

51:01.418 --> 51:03.028
Buenas tardes,
recepciÃ³n?

51:03.072 --> 51:04.812
I'm sorry. Let me get someone
who speaks Spanish.

51:04.856 --> 51:06.292
Oh, no, no.
No problem.

51:06.336 --> 51:08.120
I would just like to speak
to one of your residents,

51:08.164 --> 51:09.643
if I may.

51:19.827 --> 51:22.308
Hector,
are you awake?

51:22.352 --> 51:24.267
You have another
telephone call.

52:06.787 --> 52:08.615
Hector?

52:08.659 --> 52:11.879
Excuse me, I'm so sorry,
but Hector seems a little upset.

52:11.923 --> 52:14.665
Yeah, sorry.
Um, I'm just --

52:14.708 --> 52:18.756
I'm sharing a bit of family
news, some good, some bad.

52:18.799 --> 52:20.236
Would you mind
putting him back on?

52:20.279 --> 52:21.454
It'll only be a minute.

52:21.498 --> 52:22.934
Of course.

52:55.009 --> 52:56.054
Okay.

52:58.099 --> 53:00.363
A, B, C...

53:04.671 --> 53:07.718
L, M, N, Ã...

53:59.596 --> 54:02.120
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.775
And?

54:06.298 --> 54:07.995
And you give me back
my money.

54:11.782 --> 54:13.610
There's no refunds,
asshole.

54:15.481 --> 54:18.049
I told you.

54:18.092 --> 54:19.442
Be nice.

54:44.205 --> 54:45.555
Amigos...

54:51.387 --> 54:52.649
Abuela...

54:59.525 --> 55:01.092
Con cuidado.

55:53.449 --> 55:55.320
of "Better Call Saul"...

55:55.364 --> 55:56.365
You're the guy,
right?

55:56.408 --> 55:57.496
What guy's that?

55:57.540 --> 55:59.063
Salamanca's guy.

56:00.543 --> 56:03.546
Are you building
some kind of case against Jimmy?

56:03.589 --> 56:05.069
That's a lot big talk.
Prove it.

56:08.072 --> 56:10.857
What Colonel Sanders is
to chicken,

56:10.901 --> 56:13.033
Saul Goodman is
to the law.

56:14.644 --> 56:16.341
It's just you
and me.

56:16.385 --> 56:19.518
Anyone who goes after
him is gonna have
to come through me.

56:24.088 --> 56:25.611
What happens now?

56:25.655 --> 56:27.396
I need to know
everything he does

56:27.439 --> 56:28.962
and everyone
he talks to.

56:30.442 --> 56:33.619
"I'm Saul Goodman. Pow.
I fight for you."
