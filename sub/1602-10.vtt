have found a set of lungs.

Yes. Always.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.471
Um, I...  I just read about your place,

08:23.301 --> 08:26.236
what does this place cost a day?

08:26.337 --> 08:28.238
That depends greatly on the specific

Oh, yeah, yeah...  but

Our minimum charge is $529 a night.

08:49.394 --> 08:50.561
(Vicki) That's room and board.

08:53.531 --> 08:57.334
For doctors, tests, and therapies.

08:57.435 --> 08:59.336
For most patients, it ranges from about

08:59.437 --> 09:01.840
$20 to $40,000 a month.

09:01.891 --> 09:05.475
The key, like I said, is your insurance.

09:05.577 --> 09:09.246

negotiate a significant discount

09:09.347 --> 09:11.041
off of those numbers.

09:11.078 --> 09:14.337
But to really answer your question,
we'd need to have a doctor.

Okay, I just think it would be
for the best that we separate.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.024
Okay, Norman, so we'll separate,
but you don't have to leave.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.125
[screams] God, just stop talking to me

31:17.226 --> 31:18.459
like that, okay?

31:18.527 --> 31:21.329
There is someone...  there's
this physical human being

31:21.430 --> 31:23.364
that's waiting for me and
we're leaving together.

31:23.432 --> 31:25.300
- Norman.
- Just stop patronizing me!

31:25.367 --> 31:27.068
You're awful!

31:28.370 --> 31:31.005
- I'm leaving with Bradley.
- Who is Bradley?

31:31.106 --> 31:32.340
What are you talking about?

31:32.441 --> 31:34.275
Mother, there really is
something wrong with you.

31:34.376 --> 31:36.010
We talked about it.

31:36.078 --> 31:39.013
Bradley Martin, remember outside the motel?

31:39.081 --> 31:41.588
Or were you just trying to
drive me even more insane?

31:43.085 --> 31:46.187
Norman, Bradley Martin is dead.

31:46.288 --> 31:48.022
(Norma) She committed suicide.

31:48.090 --> 31:50.124
Well then, how do you
think she's in the motel?

31:50.192 --> 31:52.052
Huh? She can't be dead.

31:54.063 --> 31:55.964
Well, you knew she was
there. You can't deny that.

31:56.065 --> 31:59.200
Okay, I am not letting
you leave this house!

31:59.301 --> 32:01.970
[both grunting]

32:02.071 --> 32:03.204
Oh!

32:03.305 --> 32:06.207
[dramatic music]

32:08.444 --> 32:12.246
Norman? Norman, please, stop.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.984
[clunk]

32:16.085 --> 32:18.186
[muttering] I'm sorry...

32:18.287 --> 32:24.025
[breathing heavily]

32:24.126 --> 32:25.994
[grunts]

32:26.095 --> 32:28.963
[dark music]

33:15.044 --> 33:18.046
[locks clicking]

33:24.420 --> 33:28.056
[phone beeping]

33:28.157 --> 33:30.058
[sniffles]

33:33.162 --> 33:35.029
Dylan, come home as fast as you can.

33:35.130 --> 33:37.965
Norman has completely gone out of his mind.

33:38.033 --> 33:40.334
And I'm just scared of
him. I need your help.

34:02.057 --> 34:03.257
Dylan.

34:06.361 --> 34:08.429
- Norma.
- He's out of his mind.

34:08.530 --> 34:10.031
I just mentioned the institution,

34:10.099 --> 34:11.032
he went crazy, he said he was leaving.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.333
I had to stop him.

34:12.434 --> 34:16.204
I knocked him out and locked
him up in the basement.

34:18.206 --> 34:21.442
[suspenseful music]

34:24.079 --> 34:26.080
Norman?

34:35.123 --> 34:37.958
[eerie music]

34:42.264 --> 34:44.132
Norman?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.472
He's not down here.

34:57.412 --> 35:01.415
Oh, my God, he got out.

35:01.483 --> 35:03.117
Where did he say he was going?

35:03.218 --> 35:05.086
I...  it's insane, Dylan.
He said he was leaving

35:05.187 --> 35:08.222
with Bradley Martin. She's dead.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.324
He's completely lost touch with reality.

35:10.425 --> 35:11.392
What do we do?

35:11.493 --> 35:15.396
Um... Bradley Martin isn't dead.

35:15.497 --> 35:17.298
What are you talking about?

35:17.399 --> 35:19.167
I mean, it didn't really happen.

35:19.234 --> 35:20.687
What didn't happen?

35:20.775 --> 35:23.070
She...  she was in trouble,
and so she faked her suicide

35:23.138 --> 35:25.139
so she could disappear
and get off the radar.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.008
(Dylan) I drove her to the
bus station when she left town.

35:27.109 --> 35:29.410
So Norman could actually
be running away with her?

35:29.511 --> 35:32.113
Yeah, I mean, it's possible, but...

35:32.214 --> 35:33.314
it...  it's also true that he sees shit

35:33.415 --> 35:36.083
that isn't really there.

35:36.151 --> 35:37.955
Okay, we gotta go find him.

35:37.981 --> 35:40.354
[suspenseful music]

35:59.074 --> 36:00.141
Thanks for coming back for me.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.376
Yeah.

36:02.444 --> 36:04.749
I'm really happy you're coming with me.

36:10.319 --> 36:13.054
[exhales]

36:13.155 --> 36:15.256
So where should we go?

36:15.357 --> 36:18.192
Let's just see how long the car lasts.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.261
Where we end up.

36:43.185 --> 36:45.119
This is the right thing to do, Norman.

36:45.187 --> 36:48.122
I have a really good feeling.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.057
I'm really proud of you
for getting out of there.

36:50.158 --> 36:53.347
Huh? For leaving your mom.

36:54.363 --> 36:57.265
[dark music]

37:00.302 --> 37:03.337
I need to talk to Bradley.

37:03.438 --> 37:07.041
No. No, you need to leave.

37:07.109 --> 37:08.555
What?

37:10.312 --> 37:13.002
I'm not leaving until I talk to Bradley.

37:13.772 --> 37:16.766
- And then you'll go?
- Sure.

37:20.389 --> 37:22.323
Mother would like to talk to you.

37:22.391 --> 37:24.722
What are you talking about?

37:26.194 --> 37:29.196
Pull over.

37:29.298 --> 37:31.198
What? Norman!

37:31.300 --> 37:32.366
[tires screeching]

37:34.469 --> 37:37.104
Did you really think you'd
be able to lure Norman away

37:37.205 --> 37:41.590
from me with that hot little
sex kitten routine of yours?

37:43.011 --> 37:44.420
What are you talking about?

37:44.433 --> 37:48.349
Don't... Bradley, don't
try and play me for a fool.

37:50.118 --> 37:52.119
I practically invented this routine.

38:01.296 --> 38:04.198
Norman!

38:04.299 --> 38:05.333
Stop it!

38:05.434 --> 38:07.168
Shut up, you dumb bitch!

38:07.269 --> 38:11.005
Shut up!

38:11.073 --> 38:14.175
[grunting]

38:14.242 --> 38:16.177
What the hell were you thinking?

38:16.244 --> 38:19.947
[grunting]

38:20.048 --> 38:21.382
No one will ever

38:21.450 --> 38:25.019
get between me

38:25.087 --> 38:29.056
and my son.

38:29.157 --> 38:34.128
[breathing heavily]

38:34.229 --> 38:35.930
Mother, what have you done?

38:43.004 --> 38:44.305
Mother?

38:49.277 --> 38:51.145
What have you done?

39:01.089 --> 39:03.991
[dreary music]

39:25.313 --> 39:27.534
I'm sorry, Bradley.

39:30.085 --> 39:32.322
I'm so sorry she did this to you.

39:32.550 --> 39:34.321
[poignant music]

40:06.054 --> 40:09.056
[creaking]

40:12.160 --> 40:15.095
[stirring music]

40:18.500 --> 40:21.502
[bubbling sounds]

40:26.441 --> 40:29.076
Norman, she was a mess.

40:29.177 --> 40:32.446
I did her a favor. Poor
girl was on a death wish.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.383
And more importantly,
she was gonna take you

40:36.485 --> 40:39.253
away from me, right?

40:39.354 --> 40:40.994
That was the plan?

40:45.775 --> 40:47.973
I could never let that happen.

40:49.130 --> 40:51.046
(Norma) You would have
died out there in the world.

40:51.084 --> 40:53.000
I would have died.

40:53.101 --> 40:55.202
We belong together.

40:58.340 --> 41:01.141
There's a cord between our hearts.

41:01.243 --> 41:03.277
Do you remember?

41:09.150 --> 41:10.473
Come here, honey.

41:12.454 --> 41:18.359
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

41:20.362 --> 41:22.196
I will take care of all of this.

41:22.297 --> 41:24.180
Okay, no one will ever know.

41:25.433 --> 41:28.402
It'll be our secret.

41:28.470 --> 41:31.171
But you can't ever tell anyone, okay?

41:31.273 --> 41:32.844
You promise?

41:36.378 --> 41:38.060
I do.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.089
Then we'll always be together.

41:48.123 --> 41:49.931
Hmm, won't that be nice?

41:52.394 --> 41:54.962
Yes, Mother.

41:55.030 --> 41:56.330
