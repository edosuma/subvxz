WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:05.880
.

00:05.922 --> 00:06.798
- We gotta keep this
in the dark,

00:08.049 --> 00:09.509
away from the chief.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.386
- Victor Helms is
sex trafficking children.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.346
He just met up
with Sean O'Neal.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.473
Drop your weapon. No!
[gunshots]

00:15.515 --> 00:17.225
I know there's other girls.
Where are they?

00:17.267 --> 00:21.062
[dramatic music]

00:21.104 --> 00:23.565
We're too late.
They're all gone.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.567
We have nothing linking
Sean to this place.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.818
How did they know
we were coming?

00:26.860 --> 00:29.612
- I'm investigating Sean
for sex trafficking.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.947
- That's is my son.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.741
This is my blood.
How dare you?

00:34.909 --> 00:37.996
[pensive music]

00:38.038 --> 00:45.170
* *

00:54.637 --> 00:55.972
[knock on door]

00:56.014 --> 00:57.223
- One sec.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.770
Everything okay?

01:01.811 --> 01:03.104
- Get the monster!
- Ahh! You got me!

01:03.146 --> 01:05.106
[shouting]
[kids laughing]

01:05.148 --> 01:06.191
Yield.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
You got me, I yield. Yield!

01:08.026 --> 01:09.903
[both laugh]

01:09.944 --> 01:12.238
Okay, movie time?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.573
both:
Yeah!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.241
- Who wants the monster
to make popcorn?

01:15.283 --> 01:16.284
both:
I do, I do!

01:16.326 --> 01:17.369
- Who wants butter?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.328
both:
Me!

01:18.370 --> 01:19.746
- Who wants salt?

01:19.788 --> 01:20.914
- Me.

01:20.955 --> 01:27.921
* *

01:27.962 --> 01:29.297
[door closes]

01:33.259 --> 01:34.260
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.012
- Any news on Sean?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.514
- Nope.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.684
Every kid Kev and I talked to,
just more of the same.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.727
They all praise
the son of a bitch,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.105
you know, Sean O'Neal
helped me get clean.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.815
Sean takes me to lunch.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.609
He understands me, got me into
therapy, that sort of thing.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.779
He actually took one kid
on a fishing trip to Wisconsin.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.075
They all think the guy's
a damn saint.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.576
- So we got nothing?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.995
- We got less than nothing.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.163
What you got?

02:02.205 --> 02:04.374
- [scoffs]
- What?

02:04.416 --> 02:06.209
- You ready
for a homicide deconflict?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.462
They got a John Doe who dropped
where we worked Los Temidos,

02:09.504 --> 02:10.922
and my name is
still in the system,

02:10.964 --> 02:12.590
so they want me to ID him.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.550
- Hmm.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.177
Do they know Los Temidos
is gone?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.179
- Maybe it's someone
from the past.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.806
I'll call Voight
on the way over.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.851
Hey, could you try and
have them in bed by 9:00?

02:24.227 --> 02:25.603
- By 9:00?
- Yeah.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.439
- How much ice cream
have they had?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.155
Good luck.
- Thanks. Good luck to you.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.698
- Yeah, you and me.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.619
- Homeless guy--
sorry, unhoused gentleman--

02:41.661 --> 02:43.621
was dumpster diving,
found the body.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.331
- When?
- About an hour ago.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.000
Looks like a robbery
gone real wrong.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.753
Wallet and phone missing,
but thing could be personal.

02:49.794 --> 02:50.920
- Why's that?

02:50.962 --> 02:53.673
- Too much blood.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.133
I got to take this.
Give me two secs.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.176
- Sure.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.678
- Just follow the blood.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.679
Oliva.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.187
[suspenseful music]

03:07.228 --> 03:14.361
* *

03:25.080 --> 03:26.581
Recognize him?

03:26.623 --> 03:29.459
- Definitely not involved in
anything we were hooked into.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.921
- I'd say he got jumped,
stumbled here, bled out.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.882
But it's overkill, right?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.008
- It's the celiac artery.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.010
Offender must have cut it.
- The what?

03:39.052 --> 03:42.055
- Celiac artery supplies blood
to the stomach and the spleen.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.598
- Sounds painful.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.350
- It is.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.559
Same thing happened to me.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.937
I was shot in the same spot
a long time ago.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.026
- All right, talk to me.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.445
- Thomas Quinn, 36,
investment banker,

03:57.487 --> 03:59.572
stabbed six times
in the abdomen.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.074
- How'd we get the ID?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.034
- Techs pulled a crumpled
credit card receipt

04:03.076 --> 04:05.453
from deep in his pocket.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.247
- Any connect to Temidos?

04:07.288 --> 04:08.790
- No, Sarge, not even close.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.417
- All right, good,
then we're done.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.335
Sign it off to Homicide.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.339
- What's the chief
doing here, then?

04:16.381 --> 04:17.882
- I got this.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.760
Patty.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.470
- I need you
to work this one, Hank.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.015
- It's straight-up robbery
and murder.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.182
Homicide's got it.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.102
- Yeah, Tom Quinn was a friend.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.603
- Sorry to hear that.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.023
- You know, he's a friend
of yours too.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.234
He's a donor at FOP,
Police Memorial Foundation,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.736
you name it.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.946
Man made it better
to be a cop in this city,

04:39.988 --> 04:41.906
so he's gonna get our best,
and that's you.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.617
- But my team...

04:44.659 --> 04:46.411
is knee deep in the middle

04:46.453 --> 04:48.580
of a major sex trafficking
investigation.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.373
- Yeah, and according
to every report I've read,

04:50.415 --> 04:53.626
intelligence has zero further
evidence on any operations.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.754
You have nothing because
there's nothing there.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
- No, because cases take time.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.799
- This is not a polite request.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.885
This is a direct order
for you to work

05:01.926 --> 05:04.137
this homicide, Sergeant.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.390
Or you will be directing
traffic by noon tomorrow.

05:07.432 --> 05:14.522
* *

05:23.406 --> 05:24.866
- We really taking this?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.827
- Here we are.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.829
What do we have?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.373
- I talked
to Thomas Quinn's girlfriend.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.665
He commutes to work
from Glenview,

05:32.707 --> 05:34.417
was supposed to be
on his way home.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.753
- According to Metra,
he's got a monthly pass.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.297
For the same two years,
it's been the same routine.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.091
- There's no witnesses,
no cams.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.426
Think he was attacked
walking to Union Station,

05:43.468 --> 05:45.053
probably didn't see it coming.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.680
It looks like he tried
to drag himself,

05:46.721 --> 05:48.056
maybe tried
to stop the bleeding,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.933
but he didn't pack it
with anything.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.019
So the pain's pretty bad.
It is hard to think straight.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.522
- So Chief O'Neal's
been feeding us a line

05:55.563 --> 05:57.607
about this Quinn
being a friend of the blue.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.983
- Yeah, that's a shock.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.111
- Well, that was my guy
Kiesel from the Hall.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.654
Didn't know Quinn.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.197
Had to dig deep to find
the guy donated something

06:04.239 --> 06:07.117
like two boxes of burgers
to the FOP picnic last year.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.035
- Well, Tom Quinn
still deserves justice.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.037
So what else
do we have on this?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.747
- I might have something.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.124
These photos
were just sent over

06:14.165 --> 06:15.583
from the ASA investigator.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.502
He's been on scene all morning.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.421
Check out this gray Sentra.
- Okay.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
- Last night,
it was parked on Madison

06:20.839 --> 06:22.590
just down the block
from the body.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.384
This morning,
all the other cars

06:24.426 --> 06:26.386
were gone except that Sentra.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.470
It was towed and ticketed
an hour ago,

06:27.512 --> 06:28.555
and it came back hot.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.556
So it could be our offender.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.099
- You and Kev check it out.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.350
- Sure.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
Hailey, I put you in
for five vacation days.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.480
How you spend those days,
that's up to you.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.109
- Okay, I'll find something.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.573
- I found a key fob
on the floor mat.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.782
I tried to start her up,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.534
but looks like
the head gasket's blown.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.327
Trust me, this car
wasn't going anywhere.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.163
- Yeah, you got that fob?

06:53.204 --> 06:54.914
- There you go.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.958
Hey, you guys
need anything else?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.960
It's a pancake morning,
huge wreck on Lower Wacker.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.088
- No, we all good, big dog.
Appreciate you.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.757
- Hmm.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.091
- Yo, Osh--
- Yeah?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.760
- What's up with that Caprice?
You still got it?

07:06.801 --> 07:09.262
- Yeah.
- What's that, '84, '85?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.805
- '84, bro.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.266
It's at the shop right now
getting a new transmission.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.435
- Pretty clean.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.603
New transmission?

07:16.644 --> 07:19.064
How are you getting
to work then?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.566
- My ma drives me.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.151
- Your mama drive?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.235
Pop the trunk.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.451
[tense music]

07:31.493 --> 07:33.286
There we go.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.704
- Jesus.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.247
- Sentra landed at our impound.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.707
Techs all over it right now,

07:37.749 --> 07:39.668
scrubbing it for DNA
and prints.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.086
- That duct tape?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.004
- Yep, Quinn must have been
bound and gagged inside.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.464
- So we're thinking
that the offender

07:44.506 --> 07:45.632
was driving him somewhere.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.884
Car conks out on Madison,
so he panics,

07:47.926 --> 07:50.261
kills him right there in the
alley, stages it as a robbery.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.763
- I just got off with CPIC.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.473
They got into the Sentra's GPS.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.517
A day before Quinn's
murder, the car,

07:55.558 --> 07:57.310
it was sitting
outside Quinn's house.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.812
- The killer was stalking him.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.855
- Yeah, so the car
left Quinn's house,

08:00.897 --> 08:03.066
it drove to an industrial
area in Archer Heights,

08:03.108 --> 08:04.776
and it stayed parked there
until an hour

08:04.818 --> 08:05.985
before Quinn's murder.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.487
- Grab Adam,
see what you can find.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.988
- Yep.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.157
- All right.
- You get anything?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.536
- Yeah, security guard said
he saw the Sentra pull in,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.079
park, tall white guy got out,

08:16.121 --> 08:17.789
started walking down
this dirt road carrying

08:17.831 --> 08:20.125
bright purple flowers.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.292
- Purple flowers?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.712
- I don't know.
That's what the man said.

08:28.216 --> 08:35.181
* *

08:41.312 --> 08:44.399
- I got your purple flowers

08:44.441 --> 08:45.734
and something else.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.824
- What the hell is this?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.201
- I don't know,
it's a memorial

08:55.243 --> 08:57.328
or a shrine or something.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.081
- Well, whatever it is,
it's creepy as hell.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.925
- Adam.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.473
Has the sewer cover been moved?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.600
- It's not actually a sewer.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.977
I worked DTO down here.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.731
It's a maintenance tunnel
for the old cable car line.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.232
It's been sealed off for years.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.069
- More flowers.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.405
- Yeah.

09:32.447 --> 09:39.371
* *

09:59.766 --> 10:02.310
[coughs] You smell that?

10:02.352 --> 10:03.311
[coughs]

10:11.486 --> 10:13.363
- Adam?

10:13.405 --> 10:15.198
- Oh, Jesus.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.911
Look at this.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.623
You got the exact same
stomach wounds, same amount.

10:23.665 --> 10:30.839
* *

10:40.932 --> 10:42.767
- It's just like Quinn.

10:51.776 --> 10:51.985
.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.153
- Patrol searched
a good half mile of tunnel.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.407
No sign of an offender
or any more bodies.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.492
- We get any ID on him?

10:59.534 --> 11:00.994
- This is Gary Dunn.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.997
ID'd thanks to his
marine tattoo right there.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.458
Served two tours in Iraq
as a computer specialist.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.585
Then he worked for a
tech company on LaSalle.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.045
Lived in Lake Forest.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.212
His wife reported him
missing three weeks ago.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.089
Left for work, never came home.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.050
- Am I looking at sutures?

11:15.091 --> 11:17.302
- Yeah, it looks like he was
stitched up, stabbed again.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.888
We found stitch thread
on the other two as well.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.140
Hunter kept them alive,
watched them suffer.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.018
- Okay, see if DNA pops.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.728
Try to find a nexus.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.232
We got a serial killer.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.235
[tense music]

11:34.277 --> 11:40.867
* *

11:40.909 --> 11:42.160
- No, no, please,
I have a daughter!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.119
[gunshots]

11:47.624 --> 11:49.668
- Kim, let's go.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.671
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.381
You gotta get Makayla.

11:54.422 --> 11:58.009
I'll change out,
meet you back, we can swap.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.928
- All right, sounds good.

11:59.969 --> 12:07.102
* *

12:08.228 --> 12:09.479
- Please, I have a daughter.

12:20.615 --> 12:21.991
I'm dying.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.077
[knock at door]

12:24.119 --> 12:26.079
- Mom, can I have
one of the yogurts

12:26.121 --> 12:27.747
with the candies in them?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.040
[knock at door]

12:29.082 --> 12:31.042
Mom, are you there?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.087
Can I have one of the yogurts
with the candies?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.338
- No, no, please,
I have a daughter.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.923
[gunshots]

12:36.965 --> 12:38.800
[knock on door]
- Mom?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.427
- Yeah, yes.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.137
Just give me a second.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.520
- All right, so the M.E.
ID'd our tunnel victims.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.730
This is Lisa Zhou.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.231
Lisa Zhou was an
investment banker.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.983
She lived with her
partner in Deerfield.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.609
Her partner
reported her missing

12:56.651 --> 12:59.404
two years ago because Lisa
never came home from work.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.365
- This is Leo Santosa,
hit off of dental records.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.659
He was the CEO
of a tech company.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.996
Married, three kids,
lived in a mansion in Glencoe.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.040
Leo was last seen at work

13:10.081 --> 13:11.833
taking the elevator
to the parking garage.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.084
He never made it to his car.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.419
- Right,
and of our three victims,

13:14.461 --> 13:15.754
Lisa more than likely
died first.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.547
The M.E. reported that
to be about two years ago.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.674
- All right,
and Leo Santosa was a year ago,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.593
Gary Dunn three weeks ago,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.136
and Thomas Quinn yesterday.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.347
- Offender's escalating,
what else?

13:25.388 --> 13:27.223
- All the victims were wealthy
one percenters.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.852
They were picked up alone,
at night, on their way home.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.229
- I touched based
with the local FBI office.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.315
A profiler on serial killers,

13:35.357 --> 13:37.650
he emphasized that
there's four types.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.612
You have the visionary,
likely or mentally ill,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.155
Son of Sam variety;

13:42.197 --> 13:44.282
the hedonist,
who's sexually driven--

13:44.324 --> 13:46.493
- Mm-hmm, and the M.E. did say
that none of these murders

13:46.534 --> 13:47.827
had sexual components.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.412
- Okay,
so that means we're closer

13:49.454 --> 13:51.081
to power control killer,

13:51.122 --> 13:52.791
someone who gets off
on dominating,

13:52.832 --> 13:54.167
or a mission killer,

13:54.209 --> 13:55.960
someone who's targeting
a specific group.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.545
- All our victims
were one percenters.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.714
- All right,
so offender's targeting

13:59.756 --> 14:01.299
the rich for some reason.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.968
We find the why,
it'll get us to the who.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.845
Talk to their families,
loved ones.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.847
Get every detail
you can about them.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.516
[suspenseful music]

14:09.557 --> 14:14.187
- Gary was nervous, like he
knew something was wrong.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.647
He thought he was
being followed.

14:15.689 --> 14:20.235
It was--for two months
before he died, I--

14:23.738 --> 14:24.739
sorry.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.990
- It's okay.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.078
- Gary told me that
it was all connected,

14:30.120 --> 14:32.038
but I didn't believe him.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.707
- What was connected?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.500
- The break-in.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.836
Nothing was stolen
except my necklace,

14:37.877 --> 14:40.547
this cheap
stainless steel thing.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.299
But it was so bizarre.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.635
- The guy took
Lisa's grandmother's necklace,

14:45.677 --> 14:46.678
a costume thing.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.221
I mean, I'm not
trying to impress,

14:48.263 --> 14:51.016
but she had 200 grand
worth of jewelry.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.350
None of it was touched.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.268
- Anything else?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.020
Anything out of the ordinary?

14:55.061 --> 14:57.605
- Yeah, a window was left open.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.940
- Like, all the way open.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.525
But the guy didn't even
break in through there.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.402
He forced his way in
through the back.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.280
It was like he wanted us
to know he had been there.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.740
- This is where he ran.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.241
He hopped the fence here.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.911
And that's where
the police found the glove.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.997
- The glove?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.041
- Yeah, our dog sleeps outside.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.751
He must have chased him.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.002
We heard the barking.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.754
- The burglar dropped a glove?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.505
Did the police take it?

15:22.547 --> 15:23.757
- Yeah.

15:23.798 --> 15:28.636
* *

15:28.678 --> 15:31.806
- I got a name,
Tyler Jerome Hansen.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.308
- All right, talk to me.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.310
The glove left behind
at the Gary Dunn burglary.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.978
Local cops never processed it

15:37.020 --> 15:38.271
'cause they didn't think
anything was there.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.773
Our techs found
a tiny hair inside

15:39.814 --> 15:40.982
and got a hit with CODIS.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.402
- Yeah, Tyler Jerome Hansen,
32, 6'2".

15:44.444 --> 15:46.946
He's got a wife,
kids, contractor.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.531
- Boy's got a sheet,
agg battery.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.200
Two years ago,
he got into a bar fight,

15:50.241 --> 15:51.993
put somebody in the hospital
for a month.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.661
- LKA's a house up in Belmont.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.372
- All right, I'll get Trudy
to crack off a warrant.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.831
Hit it.
- Let's go.

15:56.873 --> 16:03.672
* *

16:14.974 --> 16:16.685
There he is.
- Got eyes on Hansen.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.314
He's moving to the back
of the house, towards you.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.358
Wife's inside too.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.651
Tyler's coming out.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.198
- Tyler Hansen.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.991
Chicago PD, turn around.
Put your hands up.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.159
- What?
- Hands up.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.369
Turn around.
Put your hands up now.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.246
Turn around. Turn around!
- What's going on?

16:36.287 --> 16:37.664
- What's happening?
- Ma'am, stay back.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.207
- What are you doing?
What's going on?

16:39.249 --> 16:40.375
- I will put you in cuffs.
I will put you in cuffs!

16:40.417 --> 16:42.627
I said stop!
- Hey, hey.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.671
- What's going on?
- Stay back.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.340
- Tyler, Tyler!

16:52.429 --> 16:52.595
.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.304
- You think I killed them?

16:55.015 --> 16:57.017
What? This is insane.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.394
Who are these people?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.854
- Well, that's Gary Dunn.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.565
He was a war hero.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.566
You ever met him?

17:04.607 --> 17:06.192
- No.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.694
- Been to his house?

17:07.736 --> 17:09.529
- Why would I go to his house
if I never met the man?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.990
- See, that's where
we got a problem.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.701
- We know the murderer of
Gary Dunn broke into his house,

17:14.743 --> 17:16.953
dropped that glove
on the way out.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.621
- What's that got
to do with me?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.498
- We found your DNA
in that glove.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.215
- No, no, it's impossible.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.884
- The science doesn't lie.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.427
- Tyler.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.263
This is your one chance
for us to help you.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.558
Three murders,
kidnapping, torture.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.060
Let me tell you
something, the Feds,

17:40.101 --> 17:43.188
they would love
to take this case.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.899
We give it to them,

17:45.940 --> 17:48.860
you're talking about a needle
in your arm, you understand?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.445
[suspenseful music]

17:50.487 --> 17:53.656
Or you talk to us and you live.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.699
It's your call.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.663
- When?
- When what?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.457
- When did these murders
happen?

18:02.499 --> 18:05.794
From 2019 to 2021,
I was living in St. Louis.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.882
I swear on my parents' grave
I had nothing to do with this.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.636
I'm not this.
I'm not a killer.

18:14.678 --> 18:15.637
I swear.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.017
- Everything Hansen said
checks out.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.520
He lived in St. Louis
during two of the murders.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.438
- It's only a five-hour drive.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.940
- So it's still possible.
What else?

18:26.981 --> 18:29.275
- I got two years of Hansen's
phone records,

18:29.317 --> 18:30.735
no calls to any of his victims.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.612
- And we know our offender
stalked his victims.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.781
That's why it's not
really adding up, Sarge.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.325
I also dug into the
agg assault charge.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.536
Some drunk ran up on Tyler's
wife in a sports bar,

18:39.577 --> 18:41.621
so he tattooed
that drunk's face

18:41.663 --> 18:42.872
with an autographed
Frank Thomas bat.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.625
- Good choice.
Lifetime .301 hitter.

18:45.667 --> 18:49.170
- Hansen's got an active social
life, family, steady job.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.131
He doesn't fit our profile.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.465
- Hank, your offender
spend the night?

18:52.507 --> 18:54.426
- We're 24 in, why?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.761
- There was a burglary
in Burlington last night,

18:56.803 --> 18:58.179
a Keith and Linda Moore.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.348
Burglar entered the
back door but kept

19:00.390 --> 19:02.434
a window open as if
to tell them he was there.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.727
- They work in the city?
- Wife does.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.020
Commutes every day.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.855
- All right, offender may be
on them right now.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.481
So let's split up
and find the Moores.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.150
Just keep your eyes open.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.359
Play it smart.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.450
- Keith Moore?
- Yeah.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.076
- I'm Officer Burgess.
This is Officer Ruzek.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.202
Thanks for coming so quickly.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.704
- Yeah, what the hell
is going on?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.664
- Keith, we think that the man
that robbed your house

19:24.706 --> 19:26.124
might be targeting your wife.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.292
- Targeting my wife?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.793
- We've got officers
going to her.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.503
Is she still at work?
She's not answering her phone.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.838
- She turns it on
when she's coming home.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.131
She's probably
coming home right now.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.008
- Okay, has she mentioned
anything weird happening

19:35.050 --> 19:36.843
in the last month,
somebody following her,

19:36.885 --> 19:38.345
anything like that?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.347
- She saw a guy in a hoodie
twice outside of our house,

19:40.388 --> 19:43.391
staring, tall white guy.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.851
- Keith, I need you
to call Linda right now

19:44.893 --> 19:46.186
and put her
on the line with me.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.729
Don't ask questions.
Just call her.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.649
- How does she commute?
- Drives.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.026
- She got a parking garage?

19:53.068 --> 19:54.402
- Addison and Weston, why?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.404
What's going--hey,
are you okay, honey?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.448
Look, I got these Chicago
police officers here.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.325
They want to talk to you.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.035
Yeah.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.954
- Linda, hi, I'm Officer Kim
Burgess with the Chicago PD.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.415
Where are you now exactly?

20:07.457 --> 20:09.584
Parking garage, top floor.
- All right.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.044
- Okay, good, Linda,
what I need you to do...

20:11.086 --> 20:12.545
- Kev, where are you at?

20:12.587 --> 20:14.047
- I'm going west on Roscoe.
- Good, you're close.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.548
All right,
she's at a parking garage,

20:15.590 --> 20:17.550
Addison and Western,
top floor, BMW,

20:17.592 --> 20:19.094
make some noise going in, okay?

20:19.135 --> 20:23.973
[siren wailing]

20:24.015 --> 20:25.433
- You in your car yet, Linda?

20:25.475 --> 20:26.685
- He's just a few blocks away.
It's gonna be fine.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.769
- Just let me
know when you are.

20:27.811 --> 20:28.978
We've got officers
two blocks away.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.397
You should hear their
sirens any second.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.066
[tense music]

20:33.108 --> 20:36.444
* *

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
Good. That's us. That's us.
Don't worry about it.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.239
- It'll be all right.
- [screams]

20:39.280 --> 20:40.490
- Baby?
- Linda, what's going on?

20:40.532 --> 20:41.908
Linda, can you hear me?

20:41.950 --> 20:43.243
Linda, Linda,
can you hear my voice?

20:43.284 --> 20:44.619
I need you to fight.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.745
Okay, we have officers
almost there.

20:45.787 --> 20:46.705
Can you fight?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.373
Linda, Linda, can you hear me?

20:48.415 --> 20:49.749
- Kev, where are you at?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.751
- We just got here.
We got three floors to go.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.545
- Okay, we think
it's going down right now.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.255
He's got to be there.

20:55.296 --> 21:00.385
* *

21:00.427 --> 21:02.887
- That driver, that driver.
- I see him, go.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.305
Go upstairs and see
if she's still there.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.598
I got it.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.143
[tires squeal]

21:08.184 --> 21:14.607
* *

21:14.649 --> 21:16.443
50-21 David,
I got a partial plate

21:16.484 --> 21:18.862
on a Mercedes
C-Class 33 John Paul

21:18.903 --> 21:20.822
fleeing towards
Western and Addison.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.827
- I got it! I see the car!

21:25.869 --> 21:32.500
* *

21:35.587 --> 21:38.089
- Hey, Chicago PD.
I need y'all to move.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.383
50-21 David, I lost eyes
on the Mercedes.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.469
I repeat, I do not have eyes
on the Mercedes.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.762
I need some cars out here.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.222
50-21 Ocean, car's bona fide,
I see blood.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.515
Driver just abducted
a female victim.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.683
We need cars now.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.356
.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.565
- Security footage
confirmed a masked offender

21:56.733 --> 21:59.152
jumped Linda Moore,
pushed her in his trunk.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.445
- Got the plate BOLOs out.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.738
- All right,
get a community alert,

22:01.780 --> 22:04.032
and I want a CLEAR alert
on Linda Moore right now.

22:04.074 --> 22:05.492
- Hey, CPIC's got it.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.994
CTA cam caught the Benz
idling at a red light.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.287
Offender took off his mask.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.789
We got a hit on facial rec.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.749
Offender's name is Mark Hansen.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.584
- Hansen?
- Tyler Hansen's older brother.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.753
It explains the gloves.
Must have used his brother's.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.755
- Adam, run him through Lexis.
- I'm already on it.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.633
Okay, Mark Hansen,
34, not married,

22:21.675 --> 22:23.468
lives alone
in a one-bedroom in Berwyn.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.303
- All right, well,
if he's following a pattern,

22:25.345 --> 22:26.763
he's not gonna
kill her right away.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.556
Let's move.

22:28.598 --> 22:32.185
[tense music]

22:32.227 --> 22:34.020
- You ready?

22:34.062 --> 22:40.985
* *

22:46.074 --> 22:47.492
- All right, move.

23:05.927 --> 23:07.095
No one here.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.642
- Sarge, place is empty,
no sign of Linda.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.310
- Comb it end to end.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.687
- Copy.

23:20.859 --> 23:23.361
- You understand any of this?

23:23.403 --> 23:24.571
- No.

23:24.612 --> 23:31.745
* *

23:58.104 --> 23:59.064
Adam.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.651
- His trophies.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.946
All right.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.531
- The only thing personal
in this whole damn room

24:08.573 --> 24:10.075
is a picture of his brother.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.577
They're close.
That man knows something.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.288
Send me those pictures.
- Yeah.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.083
- None of what you're saying
makes any sense to me.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.793
- It makes sense to Mark.

24:19.834 --> 24:20.794
- No, no.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.671
My brother's not
a serial killer.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.048
He's not holding onto some
woman, watching her bleed.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.466
- Recognize this, Tyler?

24:26.508 --> 24:28.051
It was at your
brother's apartment.

24:28.093 --> 24:31.971
And this is at the site
where we found three bodies.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.393
- He studies history.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.769
He gets obsessed.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.146
- You don't want it to be true.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.731
It's true.
- No.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.150
- And right now, there is a
woman bleeding out in pain

24:44.192 --> 24:45.694
and fighting for her life.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.613
Look at me, Tyler.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.450
Look at me, Tyler.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.330
The same thing happened to me.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.000
And two things kept me alive:

25:00.041 --> 25:04.045
my kid and knowing that someone
was gonna come help me.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.009
Linda deserves that.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.930
- He's my brother.
- I know.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.099
And that woman deserves help.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.185
Where would he go?

25:21.396 --> 25:23.023
Where would he take her?

25:27.736 --> 25:30.530
- I have no--
I have no idea where he'd be.

25:30.572 --> 25:37.245
* *

25:42.751 --> 25:45.128
I don't know where he'd go,
but I--

25:45.170 --> 25:46.129
- But what?

25:50.842 --> 25:52.927
- I think I know
why he's doing it.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.143
- According to Tyler,
it's all related

26:00.185 --> 26:01.978
to the ancient
Greek King Lantos.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.855
- Okay.
- It's Mark's why.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.857
Lantos took revenge
on the men that murdered

26:05.899 --> 26:07.275
his people, the rich elites.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.985
Then as a way
to appease the gods,

26:09.027 --> 26:11.738
he would build
these shrines to the dead,

26:11.780 --> 26:13.198
a way to ask for forgiveness.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.409
Now, Mark did his
college thesis on Lantos.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.828
His--his username was Lantos22.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.997
- I'm still not
hearing the why.

26:21.039 --> 26:26.169
- Mark's parents were killed
by a rich CEO

26:26.211 --> 26:29.130
who drank six dirty Martinis
at a business dinner,

26:29.172 --> 26:31.174
hopped into his Range Rover,
and caused this.

26:31.216 --> 26:33.677
Mark was in the back seat.
He lived.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.429
Mark's mom took a shard
of glass to the abdomen,

26:36.471 --> 26:37.972
and Mark watched her bleed out.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.599
- Let me guess,
the CEO survived.

26:39.641 --> 26:40.975
- Yeah, CEO survived.

26:41.017 --> 26:42.811
He was drunk
and it was a hit and run,

26:42.852 --> 26:45.188
but he hired
a multimillion dollar lawyer,

26:45.230 --> 26:48.024
and the guy got two years
in a country club prison.

26:48.066 --> 26:50.860
In Mark's mind,
money killed his parents

26:50.902 --> 26:52.612
and money set the killer free.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.531
- So why not just
go after the CEO?

26:54.572 --> 26:57.534
- He died of pancreatic cancer
two years after the crash.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.202
- Karma's a bitch.

26:59.244 --> 27:02.872
- So Mark is haunted by his
parents' death his whole life.

27:02.914 --> 27:05.417
He discovers Lantos,
gets an affinity

27:05.458 --> 27:08.253
for the mission to rid
the world of one percenters.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.713
And then he starts killing.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.548
- Okay, so why the escalation?
Why now?

27:11.589 --> 27:13.717
- Because Lantos
killed himself at 34

27:13.758 --> 27:15.343
at the completion
of the mission.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.721
Mark turns 34 in two weeks.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.889
- I got a call
from asset forfeiture.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.641
A credit card linked
to Tyler Hansen

27:21.683 --> 27:23.893
has been used in multiple
locations in Cicero

27:23.935 --> 27:26.688
for the past three years,
including the two years

27:26.730 --> 27:27.856
he lived in Saint Louis.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.357
- You got that address
in Cicero?

27:29.399 --> 27:30.734
- Mostly gas stations.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.110
- All right,
let's split up, hit them all.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.111
Find him.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.614
- Guy was a prick.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.743
No security cams.
What's the next location?

27:39.784 --> 27:42.162
Kim, you hear me?
What's the next location? Kim?

27:42.203 --> 27:43.830
- Yeah, I got--
just give me a second.

27:43.872 --> 27:46.541
[phone buzzing]

27:46.583 --> 27:48.126
Platt, you're on speaker
with Adam.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.879
- I put the name Lantos
into every database we had.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.007
The county clerk
sent over property deeds.

27:54.049 --> 27:56.843
There's an LLC called Lantos
that owns property

27:56.885 --> 27:59.804
in Cicero, 1268 South 50th.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.431
- How's a city employee
pay for that?

28:01.473 --> 28:02.766
- He didn't.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.184
It was his father's property
from way back.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.685
Mark inherited it.
- Well, we're five blocks out.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.145
We've got it.

28:07.187 --> 28:14.152
* *

28:20.116 --> 28:21.201
Adam?

28:21.242 --> 28:22.786
- Yeah?

28:22.827 --> 28:25.330
- I don't have my gun.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.831
- Back in the car.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.126
What are you talking about?

28:30.168 --> 28:32.045
- I must have left it
in the gun safe

28:32.087 --> 28:33.880
outside the interview room.
I don't know.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.548
I don't know.
I was rushing around.

28:35.590 --> 28:36.716
- Okay,
I made the same mistake.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.884
Happened to my old man
once a week.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.886
- It doesn't happen to me.
- I know.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.471
You're gonna hang back.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.473
- I--God no, you--please,
you cannot go in alone.

28:43.515 --> 28:44.724
- You're not going in naked.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.142
And we can't wait
if she's in there.

28:46.184 --> 28:47.560
- Right, okay.

28:47.602 --> 28:50.146
- Hang back. It's all right.

28:50.188 --> 28:57.112
* *

30:06.723 --> 30:07.849
[gunshot]

31:08.326 --> 31:10.787
- Jesus, Kim.
What are you doing here?

31:10.829 --> 31:12.330
- I heard a gunshot.

31:12.372 --> 31:14.332
- I had to shoot the lock.
All right, got it?

31:17.335 --> 31:18.294
50-21 Ida.

31:18.336 --> 31:20.046
- Hi, Linda.

31:20.088 --> 31:21.798
It's the PD, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

31:21.840 --> 31:22.716
We're gonna get you
out of here.

31:22.757 --> 31:23.967
- It hurts.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.802
It hurts.
- I know.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.178
I've got you, okay?

31:27.220 --> 31:31.057
Okay, you're doing so good.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.309
You're being so strong.

31:33.351 --> 31:35.311
Take your hands.

31:35.353 --> 31:37.772
I need you press
as hard as you can.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.399
Can you listen to my voice?
- Mm-hmm.

31:39.441 --> 31:40.483
- Listen, okay?

31:40.525 --> 31:43.236
You don't have to be
scared anymore.

31:43.278 --> 31:45.780
Because you're not alone, okay?

31:45.822 --> 31:49.325
You're not alone.
We're here with you.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.660
[door slams]

31:50.702 --> 31:57.500
* *

31:58.710 --> 32:00.045
- Stay with her.
- Yep.

32:03.298 --> 32:04.591
- [groans]

32:04.632 --> 32:07.344
- [whispering] Linda,
I need you to be so quiet.

32:07.385 --> 32:10.388
Just be quiet
a little longer, okay?

32:10.430 --> 32:12.682
I know it's hard.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.184
Okay?

32:14.225 --> 32:15.935
We're gonna be okay.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.479
We're gonna be okay.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.691
I'm with you.

32:21.733 --> 32:28.907
* *

32:39.417 --> 32:41.252
- Chicago PD,
drop the gun, Mark.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.632
There ain't no way out.
It's over.

32:45.674 --> 32:48.510
- Did you go downstairs?

32:48.551 --> 32:50.220
Is she dead?

32:50.261 --> 32:51.846
- Is who dead, Mark?

32:51.888 --> 32:53.848
- Linda.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.433
Is that her blood
on your hands?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.436
- Yeah.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.980
- You found her.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.066
You find her in time?
Or is she dead now?

33:03.108 --> 33:05.443
- Oh, she's dead.

33:07.696 --> 33:09.364
So you can drop the gun.

33:09.406 --> 33:10.740
Come on.

33:10.782 --> 33:15.370
* *

33:15.412 --> 33:17.122
[gunshot]

33:21.793 --> 33:23.003
[grunting]

33:24.838 --> 33:26.464
Kim, I'm good.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.887
Linda all right?

33:32.929 --> 33:34.556
- Yeah, we're okay.

33:34.597 --> 33:37.142
Get me those paramedics.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.893
- No, you liar.

33:38.935 --> 33:40.145
You liar.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.105
- You're under arrest
for the abduction

33:42.147 --> 33:45.817
and murder of Thomas Quinn,
Leo Santosa...

33:45.859 --> 33:48.695
- Hey, you're okay.

33:48.737 --> 33:53.199
* *

33:58.121 --> 33:58.288
.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.456
- I'm gonna finish
sorting out the paperwork,

34:00.665 --> 34:01.875
and then I'm gonna
head out, all right?

34:01.916 --> 34:03.752
- Hey, Kim, one sec, okay?

34:03.793 --> 34:05.211
- Yeah, what's up?

34:05.253 --> 34:07.464
- Tell me what's going on.

34:07.505 --> 34:08.423
Talk to me.

34:10.508 --> 34:12.802
- What?

34:12.844 --> 34:14.262
- Come on.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.224
Kim, I know we don't talk
about it much,

34:18.266 --> 34:19.726
what happened to you
when you were shot,

34:19.768 --> 34:23.355
you know, when you were alone
fighting for your life.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.398
But this case, you know,
what happened to these victims,

34:25.440 --> 34:26.775
how they died,
I can understand--

34:26.816 --> 34:28.568
- No, stop.

34:28.610 --> 34:29.736
No.

34:29.778 --> 34:31.863
[apprehensive music]

34:31.905 --> 34:33.615
I don't know why
I forgot my gun.

34:33.656 --> 34:34.949
I just forgot it.
But it's not gonna happen--

34:34.991 --> 34:36.201
- I'm not just talking
about the gun.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.370
- I dealt with the shooting
when it happened.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.330
I did. I dealt with it.
- You had to. I know you did.

34:40.372 --> 34:42.332
- Okay, I don't understand.

34:42.374 --> 34:44.918
- It's just if it's
coming up again,

34:44.959 --> 34:49.005
or if it does in the future,
there ain't no shame in it.

34:49.047 --> 34:51.758
I'm here for you.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.426
- I know.

34:53.468 --> 34:56.096
- You and I,
we'll figure it out.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.265
- Well, thank you.

34:59.307 --> 35:00.725
But this was just a bad day.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.106
I'm gonna finish
sorting the paperwork.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.649
Meet you at home.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.693
- Okay.

35:09.734 --> 35:16.658
* *

35:57.032 --> 35:58.950
- Hi.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.160
- Hey.

36:02.412 --> 36:03.663
[sighs]

36:03.705 --> 36:05.540
Any luck?

36:05.582 --> 36:06.541
- No.

36:09.169 --> 36:11.671
Still just trying
to find something.

36:14.174 --> 36:15.425
What are you doing here?

36:18.178 --> 36:19.971
- I don't know.

36:20.013 --> 36:21.765
Same.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.692
[pensive music]

36:32.734 --> 36:37.947
* *

36:37.989 --> 36:40.116
Why do you think
Sean does this?

36:46.414 --> 36:47.999
Our serial,
Mark Hansen, he would

36:48.041 --> 36:53.421
watch his victims bleed out,
which was wrong, demented.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.340
But with his past, it--

36:55.382 --> 36:57.050
- Kind of made sense.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.636
- Yeah, yeah, it was--

36:59.678 --> 37:02.847
it was the pain
just all twisted up.

37:02.889 --> 37:06.059
Twisted up. But why Sean?

37:06.101 --> 37:07.394
It's not for money.

37:07.435 --> 37:09.729
His house is crappy.
He drives an old car.

37:09.771 --> 37:15.068
And if we believe all
the kids that we interviewed,

37:15.110 --> 37:16.444
he really helps them.

37:19.406 --> 37:22.617
And we don't have any proof
that Sean's abusing kids.

37:24.703 --> 37:27.497
I mean...

37:27.539 --> 37:33.253
don't you think someone here
would've seen her?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.463
Someone would have suspected--

37:35.505 --> 37:37.048
- Maybe.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.926
But he has no girlfriend,
boyfriend.

37:39.968 --> 37:44.347
He's devoted his life
to being sober, being better.

37:46.808 --> 37:48.977
We're missing something.

37:49.019 --> 37:54.649
* *

37:54.691 --> 37:57.902
- He did four stints
of rehab in Waunakee?

37:57.944 --> 38:00.780
- Mm-hmm.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.323
- Why Wisconsin?

38:02.365 --> 38:04.034
- He spent his summers
up there with his dad

38:04.075 --> 38:06.995
when he was a kid,
up at the cabin.

38:07.037 --> 38:11.958
He did his first rehab
there when he was 17.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.793
I guess he liked the program.

38:13.835 --> 38:14.836
- Hmm.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.635
- Why?

38:22.677 --> 38:26.598
- A kid mentioned Wisconsin
to Adam.

38:26.639 --> 38:29.267
- What? I don't have that.
- No, but it just happened.

38:29.309 --> 38:31.478
He just mentioned it
in passing that Sean

38:31.519 --> 38:33.897
took him fishing in Wisconsin.
Hold on.

38:33.938 --> 38:35.023
Yeah, here it is.

38:35.065 --> 38:37.359
Sean took him up
to Waunakee to a cabin.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.527
Adam dug into it.
Cabin was sold five years ago.

38:39.569 --> 38:41.446
- What's the new owner?

38:41.488 --> 38:44.324
- Uh, there isn't one.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.201
Property was abandoned.
The county owns it.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.702
Maybe this is where
it all started.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.162
- I'll drive.

38:49.204 --> 38:52.123
[suspenseful music]

38:52.165 --> 38:59.297
* *

39:01.216 --> 39:02.676
- Looks abandoned.

39:34.916 --> 39:36.292
- Kim?

39:54.102 --> 39:55.687
- Hey.

40:07.365 --> 40:08.366
- Ready?
- Yeah.

40:08.408 --> 40:14.956
* *

40:46.863 --> 40:47.822
Here.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.377
- Kim.

41:14.808 --> 41:16.518
- My God.

41:16.559 --> 41:23.692
* *

41:28.071 --> 41:30.990
[tense music]

41:31.032 --> 41:37.997
