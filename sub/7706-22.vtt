[blows]

00:06.640 --> 00:07.673
[sniffing]

00:07.675 --> 00:11.543
Aah! Nothing like
the smell of a new car.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.380
[honking]

00:15.649 --> 00:20.652
- Yeah.
- What...is that?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.154
My new wheels.

00:22.156 --> 00:25.457
This will really impress
the chicks.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.060
- Are you impressed?
- No.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.397
I was talking to the chick.
Not the mother hen.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.167
What is that thing?

00:35.169 --> 00:37.002
It's not a thing.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.905
It's an ALF Romeo.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.640
How did you make it?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.842
Well, out of a bunch
of useless junk.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.245
I got the brakes
from your bicycle.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.347
The engine
from Willie's lawn mower

00:48.349 --> 00:52.184
And the seat cover
from Kate's wedding dress.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.519
ALF!

00:53.521 --> 00:55.587
Where you planning
to wear it again?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.892
Get that car
out of the living room.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.661
Fine. Clear the cross walk.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.631
[engine revving]

01:06.901 --> 01:08.934
[crashing]

01:12.406 --> 01:15.841
Great! Now I have
to build a tow truck.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.579
[theme music]

01:49.977 --> 01:51.977
[music continues]

02:20.975 --> 02:22.608
[doorbell ringing]

02:22.610 --> 02:23.876
[sighs]

02:27.314 --> 02:29.114
Oh, hi, Pete.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.315
Hi, Willie.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.818
Another package for ALF Tanner.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.319
Huh.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.289
- How much?
- 29.95.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.824
You got off easy this time.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.792
Here you go.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.794
- I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.863
- Probably this afternoon.
- Mm.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.966
[door shuts]

02:47.968 --> 02:50.969
Oh, ALF?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.137
I have a package

02:52.139 --> 02:54.806
and a lecture for you.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.844
How come those things
always come in pairs?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.879
Oh, boy! It came!

03:03.150 --> 03:04.816
Here, here, here.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.486
Oh, ALF. What is it this time?

03:07.488 --> 03:08.720
Beats me.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.691
You're getting Styrofoam
all over the carpet.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.725
Sorry.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.564
[spits]
Yuck!

03:18.566 --> 03:20.065
They're stale!

03:21.335 --> 03:22.534
Look..

03:22.536 --> 03:24.536
It's a ventriloquist's dummy.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.307
Yeah! Yeah, I saw one of
these little guys on TV.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.742
He was hilarious!

03:34.682 --> 03:37.149
Come on, dummy, speak to me.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.989
Just my luck. He's a mute.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.365
(ALF)
Come on, talk!

03:53.367 --> 03:55.701
Talk!

03:55.703 --> 03:57.903
Don't make me
get the rubber hose.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.840
He's broken, Willie!

04:01.842 --> 04:04.710
Looks like you blew 30 bucks.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.212
ALF, I'm not going
to raise my voice.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.780
I'm not going to threaten you.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.417
I'm just going to say,
for the 928th time

04:12.419 --> 04:16.588
please don't ever do this again.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.060
I'd better send Willie
some flowers, Lynn.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.962
Bring me the phone.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.631
No.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.132
You've got to stop spending

04:27.134 --> 04:28.700
other people's money.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.738
Why? People like it
when you spend their money.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.274
On Melmac that's how you said

04:35.276 --> 04:36.642
"I care."

04:37.444 --> 04:38.777
If you don't stop caring

04:38.779 --> 04:41.880
you're gonna send dad
to the poorhouse.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.317
I noticed
you haven't said very much.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.586
ALF, you have to make him talk..

04:47.588 --> 04:48.820
...like this.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.924
Hi, ALF, pleased to meet you.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.426
That's amazing!

04:54.428 --> 04:57.229
He sounds just like you!

04:57.231 --> 04:59.331
That was me. See, look.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.932
You just pull
this little string

05:00.934 --> 05:03.935
and he'll open his mouth
and say whatever you want.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.271
We had a guy like that
on Melmac.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.839
Our president.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.709
Here. You try it. That's it.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.613
Hi, Lynn!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.915
Pay no attention
to the furry guy

05:16.917 --> 05:20.018
with his hand up my back.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.254
You're not supposed
to move your lips.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.890
What lips?

05:25.993 --> 05:28.760
You-you have to talk
with your mouth closed.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.531
Oh. Well, no problem.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.633
[mumbling]
Hi, Lynn!

05:34.635 --> 05:36.468
Pay no attention to the guy

05:36.470 --> 05:39.004
with his hand up my back.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.042
Kate, Kate. Can you hold off
on the vacuuming?

05:44.044 --> 05:47.512
We're in the middle
of something here.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.816
I'm not going to vacuum.
You are!

05:50.818 --> 05:54.286
- Me?
- Yes, you.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.654
And as my mother once said

05:55.656 --> 05:58.523
"those who don't work,
don't eat."

05:58.525 --> 06:01.660
Sweet lovable grandma said that?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.562
I'm surprised.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.736
You heard the lady.
You better put that thing away.

06:10.738 --> 06:15.574
It's not a thing.
It's my new pal.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.709
What do you think
I should name him?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.010
I don't know.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.379
Their names are usually goofy

06:20.381 --> 06:22.581
like Mortimer Snerd.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.116
Knucklehead Smith.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.886
I think I'll call him..

06:27.888 --> 06:29.187
...Paul.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.655
Paul?

06:30.657 --> 06:32.524
That's not a goofy name.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.559
Oh, it is on Melmac.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.695
One time I called a guy Paul

06:36.697 --> 06:39.865
I ended up with 14 stitches!

06:39.867 --> 06:42.768
It's a good thing I didn't
call him a son of a Paul.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.437
I'll remember that.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.906
Although I have no idea why.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.608
Hey, look, this teaches you
how to talk

06:49.610 --> 06:51.543
without moving your mouth.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.878
Repeat after me.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.348
"A boy bought a baboon."

06:56.350 --> 06:58.250
- What boy?
- I don't know.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.620
- Well, where did he buy it?
- It doesn't matter.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.189
- Can I have one?
- It never happened.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.058
Then why are you
spreading these rumors?

07:07.060 --> 07:10.362
That's it! I'm doing my homework
someplace else.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.631
Well, thanks for all your help!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.568
Hey, ALF, want to play
a computer game?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.036
Well, not right now.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.605
Hey, how would you like
to help me learn ventriloquism?

07:20.607 --> 07:23.141
Sure. What do I do first?

07:23.143 --> 07:25.610
First you plug in
that vacuum cleaner

07:25.612 --> 07:29.147
and suck up
all those Styrofoam thingies.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.248
No way!

07:30.250 --> 07:33.318
I'm not as gullible
as I used to be.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.322
Hey! Where is everybody going?

07:38.892 --> 07:39.991
Boy!

07:39.993 --> 07:43.328
Doesn't anybody want to have
any fun around here?

07:44.431 --> 07:45.597
I do.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.833
[instrumental music]

07:53.841 --> 07:55.140

'Ta-da!'

07:55.142 --> 07:57.776
Welcome to
the Tanner dinner theater.

07:57.778 --> 08:01.947
Starring Gordon Shumway
and Paul!

08:01.949 --> 08:03.915
Oh, ALF, what are you doing?
We were just--

08:03.917 --> 08:07.686
There will be no talking
during tonight's performance.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.422
And now, our opening joke.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.190
Say hello, dummy!

08:12.192 --> 08:13.625
Hello, dummy!

08:13.627 --> 08:15.260
[laughs]

08:15.262 --> 08:16.795
Oh, brother!

08:16.797 --> 08:20.298
Oh-oh! The crowd looks tough.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.033
So does the roast beef.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.369
[laughs]

08:24.371 --> 08:28.507
Hey, Paul. It looks like
they're glad to see you.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.775
Oh, that's 'cause
with me on your hand

08:30.777 --> 08:33.178
you can't grab all the food!

08:33.180 --> 08:34.646
[all laughing]

08:34.648 --> 08:36.948
We kill us!

08:36.950 --> 08:39.284
ALF, how did you
get so good so fast?

08:39.286 --> 08:42.120
Well, I pick things up
pretty quickly.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.823
Except for those
Styrofoam thingies.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.425
You shoved them under the rug!

08:48.996 --> 08:51.963
Well, Sshh. Ow! He bit me.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.231
Oh, you're lucky
I didn't tell 'em

08:53.233 --> 08:55.000
that you broke
Willie's brand new--

08:55.002 --> 08:57.469
Uh, in closing,
I'd like to leave you

08:57.471 --> 09:00.906
with something me dear departed
grandfather said.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.108
[speaking in foreign language]

09:03.844 --> 09:05.510
Is that Melmacian?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.045
No, it's gibberish.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.381
The man was a babbling idiot.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.715
[laughing]

09:10.717 --> 09:13.919
Ha! Ha!
Hey, how about some applause?

09:13.921 --> 09:16.721
- Okay.
- Pretty nice. Very nice!

09:16.723 --> 09:20.725
So, only caused me 29.95.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.427
On core, on core.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.196
No, no, no. Not now, ALF,
the food's getting cold.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.933
But we haven't done
our show stopper.

09:27.935 --> 09:32.404
¶ Ebony and ivory ¶¶

09:32.406 --> 09:33.438
[indistinct chatter]

09:37.911 --> 09:40.345
Where's Geppetto?

09:41.882 --> 09:44.716
Last time I saw him,
he and Paul were playing poker.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.451
You know,
it was kind of strange.

09:46.453 --> 09:50.121
Paul was cheating
and ALF didn't seem to notice.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.792
Well..

09:53.794 --> 09:55.961
...at least they're
not here, not now.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.197
I mean...if you know
what I mean.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.068
No, I-I don't know
what you mean.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.971
Well..
I know what you mean.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.941
- Oh, baby!
- 'Oh!'

10:10.644 --> 10:11.977
ALF.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.546
Did we spoil the moment?

10:14.548 --> 10:15.614
[sighs]

10:15.616 --> 10:19.150
ALF, stop hiding under the bed.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.754
Hey, it's no picnic
for me under there.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.989
Well, actually it was.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.291
We ate a couple of dust bunnies.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.960
Why are you here?

10:28.962 --> 10:32.597
Ask Paul. It was his idea.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.133
Okay. Why are you here?

10:35.135 --> 10:37.836
Alright. I heard ya, I heard ya.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.771
It's showtime!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.974
No, it's bedtime.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.444
I'd like to start
with my impression of ALF.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.579
Me?

10:47.581 --> 10:50.148
Yeah, you, fur-brain.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.083
Yo, Wilhelm.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.020
You're going to have
one less mouth to feed.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.188
I ate your cat!

10:58.125 --> 11:00.325
Oh, ho. Very funny.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.427
Goodnight.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.928
Goodnight.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.864
Impression number two.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.500
Someone who ate Kate's cooking.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.336
[retching]

11:13.106 --> 11:14.973
Paul, that is the second time

11:14.975 --> 11:17.842
you have insulted my cooking.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.545
I'm trying to reason
with a block of wood.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.313
Block of wood?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.882
Hey, Kate, easy.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.884
He's sensitive about his roots.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.086
[Kate sighs]

11:28.955 --> 11:30.989
You know what this means?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.858
You're making a right turn?

11:33.860 --> 11:35.026
Get out.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.828
This is all your fault.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.163
Oh, don't blame me.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.197
They wouldn't know talent

11:39.199 --> 11:41.099
if it threw up on their bed.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.469
This is getting really bizarre.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.739
Oh, baby!

Hi, ALF.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.370
I-I didn't know
you were still awake.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.072
ALF's asleep.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.374
You're talking to me.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.129
Not one-handed.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.231
Why do we have to run away?

12:46.233 --> 12:50.301
Because this place
is a suburban Sing Sing.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.938
Hi, ALF. Whatcha doing?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.307
Uh, running away from home.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.577
Oh, great. Tell the whole world!

12:59.579 --> 13:01.546
Why are you running away?

13:01.548 --> 13:02.914
None of your business!

13:02.916 --> 13:05.550
[laughs]

13:05.552 --> 13:07.585
I'm gonna tell dad.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.654
Dad!

13:09.656 --> 13:10.955
Hey, hey!

13:10.957 --> 13:13.992
What's the idea
of lying to Brian like that?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.927
Ow! Don't hit me.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.695
Shut up and keep packing.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.934
Well, what if I don't wanna go?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.236
What if someone sees me?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.972
I'll tell 'em
you're my pet sloth..

13:27.974 --> 13:30.375
...which isn't too far
from the truth.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.846
I don't know
why I stay friends with you.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.582
Because I'm your alter ego.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.783
You're my what?

13:38.785 --> 13:41.419
I tell you what to do.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.621
Now, grab that radio over there.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.323
We'll hock it.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.092
I can't take that.
It's Willie's!

13:48.094 --> 13:49.861
You're not taking anything.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.797
And I think it's time
I took that dummy away from you.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.199
No! No!

13:54.201 --> 13:57.569
Yeah. Back off or you'll be
sucking splinters.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.673
ALF..

14:01.675 --> 14:04.142
...uh, Paul is only a toy.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.645
How about if we replace him
with a Papa Smurf?

14:07.647 --> 14:11.349
Why don't we replace the two
of you with Ozzie and Harriet?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.418
At least Harriet could cook.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.856
That's it, mister.
You are kindling.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.825
No, no! Don't take Paul
away from me.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.126
He'll die!

14:23.797 --> 14:26.664
ALF, w-why don't you and Paul
just go in the house?

14:26.666 --> 14:29.300
Uh, we're not gonna
bother you anymore. I promise.

14:30.804 --> 14:34.205
See how nice they are?
Thank you.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.640
That's very kind of--

14:35.642 --> 14:36.841
Come on! Come on!

14:36.843 --> 14:38.710
I'll teach you how to smoke.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.880
- But I don't wanna smoke.
- It's good for ya.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.581
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.684
Willie, what..

14:46.686 --> 14:48.353
What did you do that for?

14:48.355 --> 14:51.823
Don't worry.
I'm getting psychiatric help.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.559
Well, good for you, honey.
But what about ALF?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.329
That's what I meant.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.865
- Oh.
- I'm calling Larry.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.533
He helped ALF last year.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.203
He didn't even send us a bill.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.272
You get what you pay for.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.117
Hey! Give me some more nuts.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.720
But I don't want any more nuts.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.355
(Paul)
'I do!'

15:28.395 --> 15:29.761
[siren wailing on TV]

15:29.763 --> 15:31.462
[banging]

15:33.066 --> 15:34.832
That is really annoying.

15:35.869 --> 15:36.868
Good.

15:42.909 --> 15:46.444
ALF, your dummy is making me
very uncomfortable.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.147
Well, at least you don't have
to sleep with him.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.622
He's giving me the creeps!

15:57.624 --> 16:00.091
[laughs]

16:00.093 --> 16:01.826
Goodbye.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.498
I think she likes me.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.539
[banging]

16:16.309 --> 16:18.109
[window creaking]

16:18.111 --> 16:20.912
Talk about a puppet dictator.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.280
You know, you don't often hear

16:22.282 --> 16:24.949
about the dangers
of ventriloquism.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.317
[knock on door]

16:26.319 --> 16:28.186
Larry, come on. Come on in.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.287
Hi, Willie, how are you?
Nice seeing you.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.955
- Oh, Lar.
- Hello, Kate.

16:30.957 --> 16:31.990
How are you, love?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.458
We appreciate your coming over.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.792
Well, I had to come over
to see if this dummy

16:34.794 --> 16:37.261
is really as bad
as you say he is.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.297
Actually, he's worse.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.465
- Oh!
- Where's the patient?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.367
Oh, he's in the living room
watching TV.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.736
- Oh?
- And eating peanuts.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.207
[banging]

16:50.944 --> 16:51.976
Hey, ALF.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.344
- ALF..
- Larry!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.546
Nice seeing you again.
How are ya?

16:55.548 --> 16:56.881
Hey-hey!

16:56.883 --> 16:59.650
Oh, great! Look who walked in!

16:59.652 --> 17:01.285
You've got a fat lot of nerve

17:01.287 --> 17:04.555
showing your face around here.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.957
Who's he?

17:05.959 --> 17:08.326
Uh, Paul, this is Larry.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.128
He is a shrink.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.030
Yeah? Well, tell him
to beat it.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.132
I'm small enough as it is.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.501
[laughs]

17:16.503 --> 17:17.902
Uh..

17:17.904 --> 17:21.239
So, uh...what's new?

17:21.241 --> 17:23.341
Well, certainly not your suit.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.709
When they made that

17:24.711 --> 17:26.644
there was only
one Brooks brother.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.047
[laughs]

17:29.049 --> 17:31.182
Hey, you're a pretty funny guy.

17:31.184 --> 17:34.185
Just wait. You'll be mad
at me soon enough.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.587
Oh, now, why would I do that?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.590
Because you're
an egg sucking bone head.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.493
Egg sucking..

17:42.495 --> 17:44.529
[scoffs]
You're really a riot.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.897
I'm surprised
you don't get along

17:45.899 --> 17:47.498
with the Tanners.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.035
Well, it's not my fault.
I like the Tanners.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.204
Speak for yourself.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.039
What's wrong with the Tanners?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.008
Too many stupid rules!

17:57.010 --> 18:00.278
Don't eat the cat.
Don't break the dishes.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.946
Don't eat the cat.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.048
ALF..

18:04.050 --> 18:05.750
...do you object to these rules?

18:05.752 --> 18:10.288
Yeah, especially
rules number one and three.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.758
I think I'm beginning
to understand.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.261
Oh, wait. You haven't heard
all the rules.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.597
Don't throw food on the floor.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.933
Don't eat food off the floor.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.402
Don't bonk the guests.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.104
I never heard that one.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.271
Great!

18:27.273 --> 18:28.573
Bonk!

18:28.575 --> 18:30.908
[groans]

18:30.910 --> 18:32.510
Still friends?

18:34.080 --> 18:36.414
Funny. Funny guy.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.483
Ah, geez.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.319
Oh.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.255
(Paul)
'More nuts.'

18:44.257 --> 18:45.756
[banging]

18:45.758 --> 18:47.258
[sighs]

18:47.260 --> 18:49.494
Lar, did you find out
what's wrong with ALF?

18:49.496 --> 18:52.597
Yeah. His dummy's a jerk.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.432
I'm glad we asked
for a professional opinion.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.501
Hey, he bonked me!

18:57.604 --> 18:59.504
Should have a rule against that.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.506
Why, I think we do.
Don't-don't we have a rule--

19:01.508 --> 19:04.609
Guys, please!
Lar, what's wrong with ALF?

19:04.611 --> 19:05.977
Well, I do have a theory.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.579
I mean, uh, ever since
ALF came to live here

19:08.581 --> 19:11.082
he had to be
on his best behavior, right?

19:11.084 --> 19:14.452
- That's been his best behavior?
- I'd hate to see his bad side.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.454
- Ah.
- Well, you just did.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.989
It's Paul.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.758
He's using the dummy
to blow off steam.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.793
But what do we do about it?

19:22.795 --> 19:25.296
Well, you could
get the dummy a dummy.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.298
But then you would be stuck
with a really little guy

19:27.300 --> 19:29.367
with a really bad temper.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.203
There-there must be another way.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.472
Tsk. Well, I have an idea.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.107
It may be a bit drastic.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.308
But I think we should go for it.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.676
What is it?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.711
Well, everybody has to break
some rules now and then.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.180
I mean, and ALF's no different.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.482
I think you, uh..

19:44.484 --> 19:46.717
I think you should
let him eat the cat.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.987
- W-what?
- No!

19:49.989 --> 19:51.722
I mean, you know, we could
let him break some dishes.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.192
I mean, anything to get-get
the old ALF back.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.294
Couldn't we just let him throw
popcorn on the floor?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.496
We'll do that, too.
Uh, what about you, Willie?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.498
Do you have any ideas?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.967
No, none. Not a one.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.336
Okay. Here we go.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.771
Ha.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.209
Look who's here!

20:11.211 --> 20:13.978
The three stooges.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.980
Couldn't we just solve this
with a buzz saw?

20:15.982 --> 20:19.317
No, no, no.
Just do what I do, okay?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.351
And one for you.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.652
Hey.

- It's our good China.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.528
Yeah, we're breaking it.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.196
[plate shattering]

20:32.198 --> 20:33.364
I was right.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.033
They are the three stooges.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.868
Hey, come on, ALF.
Have some fun. Grab.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.605
No, don't do it! It's a trap!

20:40.607 --> 20:42.673
No, it's not. Here.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.842
- Throw some popcorn around.
- Yeah.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.612
To-toss it
anywhere you want, ALF.

20:47.614 --> 20:51.115
This is too good to be true.
I've got to go for this one.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.893
Hey, hey, hey! I'm on a roll!
Bring me some dishes!

21:02.895 --> 21:04.762
You'll be sorry!

21:04.764 --> 21:08.766
Don't listen to him. Here.
Give it a heave.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.136
How many points for hitting
that picture of Kate's mother?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.138
A hundred.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.539
Willie!

21:18.077 --> 21:20.544
[shattering]

21:20.546 --> 21:24.548
More plates!
That picture taunts me still.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.650
We're out of plates!

21:25.652 --> 21:27.418
Break something else, ALF.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.753
But like what?

21:28.755 --> 21:31.989
How about something small,
wooden and obnoxious?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.659
Leave Kate's meat loaf
out of this.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.297
He was talking about you.

21:39.299 --> 21:43.000
And he's right!
You are obnoxious.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.771
Yeah? Well, you're
a mama's alien.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.840
Paul, you said
you were my friend.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.109
I lied!

21:52.111 --> 21:53.911
Think about it, ALF.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.180
Do you really need
a friend like Paul?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.950
He's right.
I don't need you.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.986
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

22:01.988 --> 22:03.487
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

22:03.489 --> 22:05.423
Say goodbye, dummy.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.125
Goodbye, dummy.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.794
[thud]

22:09.796 --> 22:11.128
Ooh!

22:11.130 --> 22:13.864
You shouldn't have bonked
the guest.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.835
How are you feeling, ALF?

22:17.837 --> 22:21.272
Great! I'm on
a house-wrecking high!

22:22.208 --> 22:23.374
He means how-how do you feel

22:23.376 --> 22:25.876
about...Paul?

22:26.612 --> 22:28.679
Oh. Well..

22:28.681 --> 22:30.815
I guess I'll miss him.

22:30.817 --> 22:33.250
But I'll get over it.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.052
I'm over it.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.087
[Kate sighs]

22:37.190 --> 22:39.156
You're gonna be alright.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.058
And to prove it
I'm gonna send you a bill.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.060
[laughs]

22:43.062 --> 22:46.197
ALF, you, you really
feel okay about this?

22:46.199 --> 22:48.165
Yeah, yeah.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.200
I've lost a friend

22:49.202 --> 22:52.636
but I've regained my left hand.

22:53.339 --> 22:56.207
We're so happy to hear it.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.243
Now, if memory serves..

22:59.245 --> 23:02.313
...we were chucking plates
at grandma.

23:07.687 --> 23:08.686
Morning, ALF.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.355
Hi, Lynn.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.590
(Paul)
Hi, Lynn.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.361
Don't do that.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.864
Boy! Nobody likes that joke.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.366
Willie and Kate
almost fell out of bed.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.902
Brian threw a Gobot at me.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.872
Well, we're all just glad
Paul's gone.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.608
- He is gone, isn't he?
- Yeah.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.042
In fact, last night

23:32.044 --> 23:35.079
I gave him
a traditional Melmacian funeral.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.548
I laid him to rest
in the same way

23:37.550 --> 23:40.117
I hope to be someday.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.118
Where is he?

23:41.120 --> 23:43.754
In the freezer,
next to the fish sticks.
