00:28.750 --> 00:31.806
Ryanair final call for passenger Wilton

00:31.882 --> 00:36.111
traveling to Brussels-Charleroi
on Flight FR-1014.

00:36.183 --> 00:38.876
Please proceed immediately to Departure Gate 6,

00:38.950 --> 00:41.416
where this flight is now closing.

00:41.484 --> 00:45.246
Do you want a car?
£ 10, Theatreland.

00:45.317 --> 00:47.442
Car? London?

00:54.552 --> 00:56.949
You want a taxi?

00:57.019 --> 00:59.348
Buckingham Palace.

01:04.653 --> 01:06.142
No one.

01:06.219 --> 01:08.482
Would you like a car, sir?

01:08.554 --> 01:10.416
Are you from Sajit?

01:11.287 --> 01:13.048
I'm not here to meet you in particular.

01:13.119 --> 01:14.244
I am here to rescue those

01:14.320 --> 01:16.809
that have been let down by the system.

01:16.887 --> 01:18.513
Okay.
Let's go.

01:18.588 --> 01:20.178
I'm over there.

02:11.126 --> 02:13.753
- Who's next?
- 2-9.

02:18.294 --> 02:20.351
Here.
My turn.

02:21.061 --> 02:22.493
Okay.

02:23.127 --> 02:24.287
Hey.

02:27.428 --> 02:29.088
Your name is now Mohammed.

02:29.162 --> 02:32.095
Thank you, Okwe.

02:42.063 --> 02:45.292
Hurry up, now, man.
Come quick, quick, quick, quick.

02:45.364 --> 02:46.830
Quick, now.

02:47.831 --> 02:50.297
Right.
You just come here.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.997
That bitch.

03:08.066 --> 03:11.157
This shit, dustbin city.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.131
So, what do I need, Okwe?

03:14.201 --> 03:15.893
Amoxicillin.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.196
You get that in Boots drugstore or not?

03:18.268 --> 03:20.325
- From a doctor.
- You're a doctor.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.264
I'm a driver.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.427
Look.

03:24.501 --> 03:26.933
They say you're a doctor, right?

03:27.002 --> 03:28.433
You get me something now.

03:28.501 --> 03:30.797
I can't piss fire another day, man.

03:30.868 --> 03:32.527
I'm a driver.

03:32.602 --> 03:35.898
It's for me wife's sake.
You know what I mean.

03:37.402 --> 03:38.562
Okay.

03:38.637 --> 03:42.091
So I'll get you all the jobs in South London.

03:43.437 --> 03:46.097
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

03:46.171 --> 03:47.398
Let me kiss you, Okwe.

03:47.471 --> 03:50.335
Maybe in return,
you can get some soap.

04:07.107 --> 04:10.595
Early is as bad as late, Okwe.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.436
Hello.
Front desk.

04:47.510 --> 04:50.671
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

04:52.079 --> 04:54.509
I'm sorry.

04:54.577 --> 04:56.702
Good night, madam.

04:56.777 --> 04:58.301
Good night, madam.

05:46.249 --> 05:47.012
What?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.073
Senay, perhaps today,
I can cook you lunch.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.844
No, Okwe.

05:56.285 --> 05:58.184
So that's true what they say.

05:58.286 --> 05:59.545
What is true?

05:59.584 --> 06:03.278
They say you and the Turkish
girl are nesting like birds.

06:03.353 --> 06:05.285
I rent her couch.

06:05.353 --> 06:08.013
In the morning,
when she's working here.

06:08.087 --> 06:09.608
We're never there at the same time.

06:09.685 --> 06:12.083
She has rules.

06:12.152 --> 06:15.847
You know, she's a Muslim,
which means she's a virgin.

06:15.921 --> 06:17.580
Like a little angel.

06:17.654 --> 06:20.382
Ivan, I think there's someone at the door.

06:24.687 --> 06:25.914
Can you believe it?

06:25.989 --> 06:28.455
One of the fuckers wanted to
put me on his Visa card!

06:28.521 --> 06:30.646
Oh, my bloomin' feet.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.019
Lucky I don't work standing up.

06:36.588 --> 06:38.248
What?

06:38.322 --> 06:40.949
Don't they have hookers where you come from?

06:41.024 --> 06:42.751
Where are you from?

06:43.589 --> 06:45.885
Somewhere with lions, I bet.

06:49.758 --> 06:51.485
I like lions.

06:53.725 --> 06:55.385
Right.

06:55.459 --> 06:56.288
Oh, yeah.

06:56.359 --> 06:59.222
You might want to send
someone to check on the room.

06:59.324 --> 07:01.951
- There is a problem?
- How should I know?

07:01.993 --> 07:05.152
I don't exist, do I?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.986
See you tomorrow.

09:05.131 --> 09:06.324
What's that?

09:06.398 --> 09:09.557
You're stealing stuff already, huh?

09:09.630 --> 09:13.428
Guy before you used to steal
whole pigs from the freezer.

09:13.499 --> 09:15.430
But you better hide it.

09:15.499 --> 09:17.191
If Sneaky sees that...

09:18.431 --> 09:20.422
Speak of the fucking devil!

09:20.500 --> 09:23.260
Where's the greeter here?

09:41.734 --> 09:44.165
This fucking place.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.490
Hey!

09:48.569 --> 09:51.399
Instead of smoking,
you clean this place up.

10:28.674 --> 10:31.572
Okwe.
Everything is all right?

10:34.941 --> 10:36.997
What's this?
Lunch?

10:37.073 --> 10:41.871
It was blocking the lavatory in Room 510.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.567
It is a heart.

10:44.541 --> 10:46.235
A human heart.

10:46.309 --> 10:47.706
What?

10:47.776 --> 10:50.536
What the fuck do you know about hearts, Okwe?

10:50.608 --> 10:53.541
Perhaps you should telephone the police.

10:55.909 --> 10:58.239
Police? You think I should call the police?

10:58.310 --> 11:00.868
Señor Juan, someone is dead.

11:00.944 --> 11:04.376
Okay.
You speak to them.

11:04.443 --> 11:08.070
You found it.
You do the talking.

11:08.145 --> 11:10.007
I'll introduce you.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.975
What's your full name, Okwe?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.335
And you never told me where you're from.

11:19.413 --> 11:23.742
Or even how come you're here
in this beautiful country.

11:23.812 --> 11:26.074
Hello? Police?

11:26.147 --> 11:28.737
Yeah, got somebody who wants to talk to you.

11:30.379 --> 11:32.208
Hello?

11:32.279 --> 11:34.575
Hello?

11:34.646 --> 11:35.772
Hello?

11:37.813 --> 11:39.643
You will learn, Okwe.

11:39.714 --> 11:43.238
The hotel business is about strangers.

11:43.315 --> 11:47.247
And strangers will always
surprise you, you know?

11:47.316 --> 11:52.373
They come to hotels in the night
to do dirty things.

11:52.448 --> 11:53.539
And in the morning,

11:53.615 --> 11:56.707
it's our job to make things look pretty again.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.511
For your trouble.

12:00.382 --> 12:03.405
You think if you don't take
the money, you are innocent?

12:03.483 --> 12:06.541
Take it.
Do something nice with it.

12:12.118 --> 12:13.606
No.

13:37.760 --> 13:42.454
It came to me last night
in a flash of inspiration.

13:46.461 --> 13:49.053
I can see.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.559
That's a good move.

13:51.928 --> 13:54.826
Guo Yi,
there's something I need.

13:54.895 --> 13:56.590
Amoxicillin.

13:56.663 --> 13:58.424
You got the clap?

13:58.496 --> 14:00.325
No.

14:00.396 --> 14:01.453
My boss.

14:01.529 --> 14:02.791
Which one?

14:02.863 --> 14:04.454
They're all the same.

14:04.563 --> 14:08.792
In this country,
the health service is free.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.796
You still driving cabs in the day?

14:12.563 --> 14:15.030
You're going to kill yourself.

14:15.097 --> 14:17.257
I do not care to sleep.

14:19.998 --> 14:23.988
When you go quiet,
it means you've won already.

14:24.065 --> 14:25.929
Go on, Okwe.
Don't be nice.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.795
Makes it worse.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.423
Well, shit.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.625
You want Chinese or English tea?

14:36.700 --> 14:37.757
Chinese.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.766
Don't know how you drink that stuff.

14:40.833 --> 14:44.732
I found it on a body.
It's blown my head wide open.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.427
You should read it.

14:46.501 --> 14:49.296
Medicine for your soul, Okwe.

14:51.568 --> 14:54.262
Guo Yi, today I also found something.

14:55.435 --> 14:58.493
In a lavatory in one of the hotel rooms.

14:58.569 --> 15:00.798
Someone's heart.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.064
A heart.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.364
A human heart.

15:06.436 --> 15:10.096
I'm only telling you
because you are a rational man.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.932
Maybe there's an explanation.

15:18.804 --> 15:22.670
Maybe some guy with one
of the girls had a heart attack.

15:22.738 --> 15:24.204
Rooms are down as empty.

15:24.272 --> 15:26.931
So the Spanish guy had to get rid of the body.

15:27.005 --> 15:28.597
Hotels hate dead people.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.161
- It was a healthy heart.
- So?

15:30.239 --> 15:32.034
So your boss was right first time.

15:32.106 --> 15:33.800
Somebody brought it with them.

15:33.873 --> 15:36.305
- Who carries human organs?
- Lots of people.

15:36.373 --> 15:38.772
- Name someone.
- Me. Okay? Me.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.397
I do it all the time.
I take my work home.

15:42.473 --> 15:45.998
What I'm saying is,
I could if I was weird.

15:46.074 --> 15:48.438
And this is a weird city.

15:49.808 --> 15:52.798
Why would anyone do that to a human heart?

15:52.875 --> 15:55.170
These sound to me like questions.

15:55.242 --> 15:58.073
I don't ask questions after 11 years here.

15:58.142 --> 16:00.108
And I'm a certified refugee.

16:00.176 --> 16:04.006
You're an illegal, Okwe.
You don't have a position here.

16:04.076 --> 16:07.133
You have nothing.
You are nothing.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.741
You wait outside.
I'll go get you those pills.

16:13.811 --> 16:16.834
Stick to helping people who can be helped.

16:33.746 --> 16:35.007
Fresh stuff.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.568
Thank you.

16:36.646 --> 16:38.045
Thank you.

17:05.749 --> 17:07.375
Senay.

17:07.450 --> 17:08.915
Senay.

17:10.282 --> 17:12.978
Senay, having only one key
is making this impossible.

17:13.050 --> 17:15.209
I do not want you coming in when I am there.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.714
At the hotel, we are friends!

17:16.784 --> 17:19.113
- I'm no different here.

17:19.184 --> 17:21.413
How would it look, Okwe?

17:21.484 --> 17:24.575
So it is better I always
chase you down the street?

17:25.452 --> 17:29.146
Wait five minutes,
then knock the door.

17:29.219 --> 17:31.776
Knock very, very quietly.

17:48.354 --> 17:50.378
Senay!

17:50.454 --> 17:52.081
Yes?

17:52.621 --> 17:55.986
Did you clean on the fifth floor
yesterday morning?

18:03.089 --> 18:05.784
Nothing works.

18:06.523 --> 18:08.614
Senay, did you clean Room 510 yesterday?

18:08.690 --> 18:12.350
What the hell are you talking
about the hotel for?

18:12.424 --> 18:14.651
Water, water, water!

18:14.724 --> 18:17.714
I was wondering if there was
a problem in 510 yesterday.

18:17.791 --> 18:19.949
You can fix these things?

18:21.358 --> 18:23.119
Okwe!

18:24.425 --> 18:26.413
You can fix...

18:27.925 --> 18:30.324
They were not clean.
Glasses need very hot water.

18:30.393 --> 18:31.518
So do women.

18:31.593 --> 18:35.025
Everything here is connected
to everything else.

18:36.993 --> 18:41.392
Okwe, in Africa, it is the man
who will cook and clean?

18:43.293 --> 18:45.420
Senay, this came for you.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.458
Why did you not tell me?

18:49.527 --> 18:51.517
I just told you.

18:55.095 --> 18:57.459
You have friends in New York?

19:00.963 --> 19:02.690
Your postcard.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.423
I have a cousin.

19:04.528 --> 19:07.325
Ever since I was small,
she has written to me.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.727
I sometimes wish London was more like New York.

19:09.797 --> 19:11.763
It would be easier to drive a cab there.

19:11.830 --> 19:14.388
You have been to New York?

19:15.864 --> 19:16.920
And you came back?

19:16.997 --> 19:19.122
I lived there for a time.

19:20.664 --> 19:23.824
In the winter,
they put lights in the trees.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.989
Is that true?

19:26.065 --> 19:28.156
And you can skate in the parks.

19:28.232 --> 19:31.664
And some of the policemen ride white horses.

19:31.732 --> 19:33.857
Not all of them, but some.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.557
What did you do there?

19:37.632 --> 19:39.393
I worked in a hospital.

19:39.466 --> 19:42.525
- You were a cleaner?
- I was there to study.

19:42.601 --> 19:44.794
So, why are you working in a hotel?

19:44.868 --> 19:47.061
It is an African story.

19:48.235 --> 19:51.859
I've noticed you never answer 'yes' or 'no.'

19:51.934 --> 19:54.264
You are very strange.

19:56.036 --> 19:57.728
You drink wine, Senay?

19:57.801 --> 19:59.926
Do you want to know why I left Turkey?

20:00.002 --> 20:01.969
Because you wanted to live like your cousin.

20:02.036 --> 20:02.627
No.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.794
Because I do not want to live like my mother.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.760
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

20:08.836 --> 20:10.927
I do drink wine.

20:29.773 --> 20:32.636
This is a recipe from Nigeria.

20:32.706 --> 20:36.103
In Nigeria, they do many
interesting things with pork.

20:39.707 --> 20:42.673
But, of course, I used lamb.

20:57.541 --> 20:59.633
Take one three times a day.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.141
Avoid alcohol.

21:01.209 --> 21:03.267
In here. Come.

21:21.945 --> 21:24.070
So she's a popular lady.

21:24.145 --> 21:27.770
My warriors cannot work
with rotten balls, Okwe.

21:27.845 --> 21:32.438
My friend is just a porter
in the hospital crematorium.

21:45.014 --> 21:46.708
Hello.
Front desk.

21:46.781 --> 21:49.441
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

21:49.515 --> 21:50.878
Hey!

21:52.981 --> 21:54.446
Hello?

21:55.216 --> 21:57.079
Yeah, room service.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.739
Sneaky doesn't know about this?

22:08.815 --> 22:11.748
Sneaky knows about everything.

22:11.816 --> 22:13.475
And you?

22:13.549 --> 22:15.641
You know everything that goes on in the hotel?

22:15.716 --> 22:17.580
Not so much butter!
Hey.

22:19.183 --> 22:21.275
You guard the door, lvan.

22:21.350 --> 22:24.010
You see who comes and goes.

22:24.084 --> 22:26.312
You would know if somebody came into the hotel

22:26.385 --> 22:28.147
but did not leave again.

22:28.219 --> 22:31.879
Why would someone not leave, Okwe?

22:34.586 --> 22:35.846
I don't know.

22:35.918 --> 22:39.851
You should remove the crusts,
like in the Ritz.

22:41.352 --> 22:43.683
Everyone leaves, Okwe.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.481
Some leave quickly.

22:45.553 --> 22:48.678
Some stay for long time.

22:48.754 --> 22:50.652
If you want to stay,

22:50.720 --> 22:55.585
don't concern yourself
with who comes and who goes.

22:58.222 --> 23:02.155
It's the little touches
that make the difference.

23:02.223 --> 23:04.484
That's capitalism.

23:04.590 --> 23:05.715
Now go.

23:05.756 --> 23:10.086
Don't forget.
You accept only cash.

23:11.989 --> 23:13.580
Room service.

23:16.089 --> 23:17.522
Thanks.

24:15.498 --> 24:19.395
Okay, you just make
yourself comfortable, and, uh...

24:19.463 --> 24:20.452
I'll go freshen up.

24:20.531 --> 24:22.053
All right?

24:24.965 --> 24:28.556
Fucking asshole.

24:37.832 --> 24:39.422
Oh, my God.

24:42.099 --> 24:44.328
Come on, babe. Hurry up.

24:45.868 --> 24:47.527
Okay, okay.

24:48.868 --> 24:51.662
Calm yourself, sweetheart.

24:53.168 --> 24:55.134
What are you doing?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.997
Have a drink first.

24:57.069 --> 24:59.967
You look fine.
Just get out here.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.798
Hey.

25:04.902 --> 25:05.833
Hey.

25:07.037 --> 25:08.525
Fuck!

25:21.605 --> 25:23.536
Enough. No more.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.094
Where the fuck did you come from?

25:25.171 --> 25:26.500
Leave now!

25:26.570 --> 25:28.400
Oh! Oh, fuck!

25:37.073 --> 25:38.595
You don't have concussion.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.638
How the fuck do you know?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.831
Christ, you must be bored.

25:42.906 --> 25:44.667
Getting your kicks spying on me.

25:44.739 --> 25:48.172
I was making sure the blockage
had not returned.

25:48.241 --> 25:49.831
Perhaps...

25:49.907 --> 25:51.395
It's Juliette.

25:51.473 --> 25:53.030
You should go home and rest.

25:53.107 --> 25:54.437
Rest?

25:54.508 --> 25:56.837
Got three more before morning.

25:56.907 --> 26:00.601
So, have you ever seen a lion?

26:00.674 --> 26:02.697
Oh, yes.

26:02.776 --> 26:04.401
On TV.

26:26.811 --> 26:28.835
I had it cut.

26:28.911 --> 26:30.774
It is yours.

26:32.046 --> 26:35.444
You were right.
This way is more sensible.

26:50.547 --> 26:54.446
Okwe, you must not tell them at
the hotel that you have a key.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.344
Senay, I tell them only the truth.

26:56.415 --> 26:57.505
Even so.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.514
And show them that your back hurts

26:59.580 --> 27:01.275
so they know you sleep on the floor.

27:01.349 --> 27:03.473
But that is not true.
I sleep on the couch.

27:03.581 --> 27:07.412
The couch is not as real as the floor, Okwe.

27:07.448 --> 27:08.971
Believe me.
I'm a woman.

27:09.050 --> 27:11.982
And some of those bitches
won't know what is a couch.

27:12.050 --> 27:14.311
But they know floor.
They clean floors.

27:17.116 --> 27:18.048
For you?

27:18.116 --> 27:20.480
Immigration-enforcement directive.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.073
Open the door.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.550
Forgive us.
Miss Gelik?

27:36.620 --> 27:38.347
Senay Gelik?
Turkish national?

27:38.420 --> 27:40.510
- Do you have your S.A.L. Handy?
- My what?

27:40.585 --> 27:42.347
Your acknowledgement letter.
Your I.D.

27:42.420 --> 27:45.182
Oh, yeah.
I carry it always.

27:45.254 --> 27:47.583
Neighbors, Senay.
They see things.

27:47.653 --> 27:50.744
In the last few days, they've
seen someone come and go.

27:50.820 --> 27:52.286
A man.

27:52.954 --> 27:56.044
Sometimes a woman in your
position can be exploited.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.019
There are people in London
without any kind of papers.

27:59.088 --> 28:01.282
- They prey on people like you.
- Prey?

28:01.354 --> 28:04.379
- There is someone living here.
- There is no one living here.

28:04.488 --> 28:06.614
You are aware that your E.L.R. Status

28:06.655 --> 28:08.349
means you are unable to accept rent.

28:08.423 --> 28:10.581
You're seeking asylum.

28:10.655 --> 28:14.213
Or engage in employment of any
kind for at least six months.

28:14.289 --> 28:17.279
- You're not working, are you?
- Mind if I use your bathroom?

28:18.424 --> 28:20.685
Your case is under review.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.893
Thank you.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.585
Thank you.

28:52.061 --> 28:53.492
Is that all you want?

28:53.560 --> 28:55.321
No, no, no, no.

28:57.062 --> 28:59.620
You know this stuff will
not only keep you awake.

28:59.695 --> 29:02.354
It'll blow your brains out.
You know that, don't you?

29:11.295 --> 29:13.990
Hey! Okwe!

29:14.696 --> 29:17.356
Keys.
There you are.

29:17.431 --> 29:19.658
Hey, Okwe.
What happened, man?

29:19.730 --> 29:22.855
Hey, somebody's husband came home early, right?

29:22.930 --> 29:23.988
Here.
Take this.

29:24.065 --> 29:27.895
We don't want the doctor getting sick, right?

29:34.698 --> 29:37.460
I played them one of these fellows' songs.

29:37.533 --> 29:39.965
And, actually,
they were very helpful.

29:40.032 --> 29:42.158
Had they already heard it or not?

29:44.099 --> 29:46.726
They were already very into funk and...

29:48.366 --> 29:50.333
It's bound to happen.

29:50.399 --> 29:52.526
You stay here too long.

29:52.600 --> 29:56.657
You start dressing like an Englishman, huh?

30:16.402 --> 30:18.301
Where is he, then?

30:18.369 --> 30:19.337
Who?

30:19.403 --> 30:23.028
I have a date.
Every payday, 4:45.

30:23.103 --> 30:24.968
Hey!

30:25.037 --> 30:26.628
Come on, lover boy.

30:26.704 --> 30:29.000
Okwe, will you help me?

30:29.072 --> 30:31.197
Hey, guy before you took £5.

30:31.271 --> 30:32.238
No, no, no, no.

30:32.304 --> 30:34.897
- But you watch the door, huh?
- Yes.

30:34.972 --> 30:36.232
Come, my little princess.

30:36.305 --> 30:38.770
Come, come, come, come,
lille princesso.

30:38.838 --> 30:43.169
Security room is out of bounds
for half an hour.

30:43.239 --> 30:47.103
Five minutes, max.

30:47.174 --> 30:50.072
Immigration-enforcement directive.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.002
Can I help you?

31:03.442 --> 31:05.874
What time do the maids clock in?

31:07.775 --> 31:10.241
- Wakey-wakey.
- 5:00.

31:12.542 --> 31:14.873
You mind if we wait?

31:15.709 --> 31:17.299
No.

31:35.211 --> 31:37.906
Excuse me, sir.
This is a nonsmoking area.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.671
If you wish,
perhaps you can wait

31:39.745 --> 31:42.405
in the designated area across the lobby.

32:15.449 --> 32:16.779
Hello?

32:20.283 --> 32:21.375
It's for you.

32:21.450 --> 32:23.349
Hello?

32:23.417 --> 32:25.645
Okwe. Okwe!

32:25.717 --> 32:27.773
But I am almost there!

32:27.850 --> 32:31.305
Senay will be here in two minutes.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.079
You must stop her.

33:38.658 --> 33:41.920
I have a medical condition.

33:41.992 --> 33:44.720
Lightning doesn't strike twice!

33:59.694 --> 34:02.354
Is that the last of them?

34:02.428 --> 34:04.088
Yes.

34:05.195 --> 34:07.490
This is an interesting place.

34:07.561 --> 34:10.085
Would you like to see a rate card?

34:30.998 --> 34:32.223
I have a friend.

34:32.297 --> 34:34.763
In her factory,
they always need people.

34:34.831 --> 34:36.695
It's a sweatshop.

34:36.764 --> 34:39.856
Is it any worse than cleaning up after whores?

34:39.931 --> 34:41.761
It's better money.

34:43.731 --> 34:46.425
Oh, you are so sad for me.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.728
I do not wish to cause harm to anyone.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.129
That is all it is?

34:50.199 --> 34:51.960
I will collect my things and go.

34:52.033 --> 34:54.123
- Go?
- How can I stay?

34:54.199 --> 34:56.893
Okwe, who will cook for me?

34:57.934 --> 35:01.196
If it's okay, I will call on you
if I have the time.

35:01.268 --> 35:03.995
But I'm owed three days' money by the hotel.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.898
I will see Señor Juan tomorrow morning.

35:06.935 --> 35:09.696
I have no money for food.

35:09.768 --> 35:13.757
I will see him today.
Meet me at the café at 4:00.

35:54.507 --> 35:56.996
You are here to see Señor Juan?

36:00.006 --> 36:01.735
Looking for work?

36:05.508 --> 36:08.303
Are you working?

36:08.374 --> 36:09.964
French?

36:10.041 --> 36:12.234
No, no.

36:12.308 --> 36:15.299
Help me.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.739
Yoruba.
You speak Yoruba?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.469
Bantu?

36:22.742 --> 36:25.471
What the fuck are you doing here, Okwe?

36:25.544 --> 36:27.008
Senay has decided to leave.

36:27.077 --> 36:29.167
She asked me to collect what she's owed.

36:29.244 --> 36:30.175
Oh, yeah?

36:30.244 --> 36:33.177
What, are you marrying her or something, Okwe?

36:35.978 --> 36:37.911
I'll get her money.

36:48.912 --> 36:51.401
No, no! It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

36:51.479 --> 36:53.741
I'm a doctor.
It's okay.

36:53.813 --> 36:58.303
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

37:04.363 --> 37:06.296
You must get this man to hospital now.

37:06.363 --> 37:07.660
He must go straightaway.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.959
If you are a doctor,
you can do something.

37:10.032 --> 37:12.555
This is the wound of an operation.

37:12.632 --> 37:15.290
Where? Where did he have this operation?

37:15.364 --> 37:16.922
Which country?

37:16.998 --> 37:19.022
You must get this man to hospital!

37:19.098 --> 37:20.792
They won't go to hospital.

37:20.866 --> 37:22.957
- No, no!
- No hospital!

37:44.734 --> 37:46.530
Guo Yi is here?

37:47.368 --> 37:48.856
Shit.

38:04.971 --> 38:07.028
Sister. Hello.
It's my first day here.

38:07.104 --> 38:08.832
I was told to collect my overall.

38:08.905 --> 38:10.928
- Which shift are you on?
- Shift?

38:11.005 --> 38:14.596
Come on. Either you're late
or you're really late.

39:13.012 --> 39:14.978
You couldn't do the bins in the kitchen

39:15.046 --> 39:17.035
when you're done in here,
could you?

40:23.453 --> 40:26.078
Okay, okay, okay.

40:27.353 --> 40:29.286
You see these blue tablets?

40:29.353 --> 40:32.115
He must take two every two hours.

40:32.187 --> 40:33.676
Understand?

40:33.754 --> 40:37.186
He must take two blue tablets every two hours.

40:47.122 --> 40:49.520
You speak English?

40:49.588 --> 40:50.884
And Somali?

40:50.955 --> 40:52.148
A bit.

40:55.890 --> 40:59.345
He says to say, 'Thank you.
God is great.'

40:59.924 --> 41:03.083
Tell them he must take two
blue tablets every two hours.

41:09.158 --> 41:11.647
And one white tablet every six hours.

41:15.758 --> 41:18.747
It is very important
that you get this exactly right.

41:23.626 --> 41:27.390
Ask him which hospital they went
to to have the kidney removed.

41:32.727 --> 41:35.250
He says they didn't go to a hospital.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.623
Ask him where they did this.

41:42.062 --> 41:42.993
In a room.

41:43.062 --> 41:46.028
He had his kidney removed in the hotel, yes?

41:46.995 --> 41:49.223
How much did he get for risking his life?

41:53.530 --> 41:56.189
He is English now.

41:56.263 --> 41:58.856
He swapped his insides for a passport?

42:04.863 --> 42:06.523
The man at the hotel said

42:06.597 --> 42:09.029
it would be like taking out a tooth.

42:46.535 --> 42:49.525
- Can I get you something?
- I've been here one hour.

42:49.602 --> 42:51.659
An hour and a half.

42:56.136 --> 42:57.398
There.

42:57.471 --> 42:59.867
I will go and collect my things.

43:01.471 --> 43:03.527
Why won't you sit down?

43:10.304 --> 43:12.532
- Okwe, where have you been?
- Africa.

43:12.604 --> 43:15.729
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I would have got you the money.

43:15.805 --> 43:17.567
The money?

43:20.839 --> 43:22.828
Do you feel that?

43:22.906 --> 43:25.168
Do you feel anything?

43:26.540 --> 43:31.030
You know, I counted.
I've seen you laugh three times.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.504
Four.

43:36.973 --> 43:39.997
You think I'm so innocent.

43:40.075 --> 43:41.336
In my village,

43:41.407 --> 43:44.533
they chew those leaves to forget
how hard their lives are.

43:44.608 --> 43:46.164
I use it to keep awake.

43:46.241 --> 43:48.764
You know it makes you look...

43:50.475 --> 43:52.873
Senay.

43:52.942 --> 43:55.704
You should keep away from me.

43:55.776 --> 43:57.867
You lost your job.

43:57.943 --> 44:00.432
Because of me,
you are in a sweatshop.

44:03.277 --> 44:05.675
And now you are going again.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.572
Be sure you make it to New York.

44:07.610 --> 44:11.135
I will make it to New York,
Okwe, thank you.

44:15.645 --> 44:18.134
It's best if you don't show up
until after 5:00.

44:18.212 --> 44:21.269
Most porters are gone by then.
Only ghosts left.

44:21.345 --> 44:22.436
Showers are here.

44:22.512 --> 44:24.808
Water's not too hot,
but it runs.

44:24.879 --> 44:27.970
Couch in my office is pretty soft.

44:28.046 --> 44:31.069
Oh, I forgot.

44:31.146 --> 44:33.738
You don't sleep, do you?

44:33.814 --> 44:38.372
My friend, welcome to my hotel.

44:38.448 --> 44:40.243
Beautiful, isn't it?

44:40.314 --> 44:44.269
And the other residents are, uh, very quiet.

44:44.347 --> 44:45.938
It will only be until I...

44:46.015 --> 44:48.481
Until the world improves.

45:32.320 --> 45:35.684
Best truffles I've ever seen in England.

45:35.754 --> 45:38.584
Dug up 15 hours ago in Provence.

45:38.655 --> 45:41.586
Came through on the night train.

45:48.288 --> 45:50.414
Shall we say one thousand?

45:50.489 --> 45:53.785
I'm in the wrong fucking hotel.

45:53.856 --> 45:56.185
One thousand, Señor Juan.
What do you say?

45:56.255 --> 45:59.619
Okay.
One thousand.

46:01.356 --> 46:04.982
But if I give you that price,
I need a favor.

46:05.057 --> 46:07.545
There is a night porter.
African.

46:07.623 --> 46:10.987
He came from you, so I guess
he came through Amsterdam.

46:11.057 --> 46:13.717
Yes.
What about him?

46:13.791 --> 46:17.246
He's some kind of doctor.
What kind of doctor?

46:17.325 --> 46:20.223
I need to know what there is to know.

46:20.792 --> 46:23.223
Police! Police!

46:44.195 --> 46:45.854
Can I help you gentlemen?

46:45.929 --> 46:48.554
We're looking for someone called Senay Gelik.

46:48.628 --> 46:50.560
Thought she might be working here.

46:50.628 --> 46:54.061
Do you see anybody working here?

46:54.129 --> 46:58.028
If you see her, give us a call.

47:21.798 --> 47:23.821
You have been here for two days.

47:23.898 --> 47:27.262
And already because of you,
I'm in trouble.

47:27.332 --> 47:30.492
Maybe I should call lmmigration.

47:30.567 --> 47:33.226
Should I call them?

47:33.300 --> 47:34.926
You wouldn't do that.

47:34.999 --> 47:39.160
I need a good reason.
What can you give me?

47:40.067 --> 47:43.932
If they find out you've been
working, what will they do?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.626
They will put you in prison.

47:46.701 --> 47:50.532
And here,
they mix the men and women.

47:50.602 --> 47:54.534
So every night,
you will be raped.

47:58.669 --> 48:01.602
If you want to be like a Western girl,

48:01.670 --> 48:05.034
that's what happens to Western girls.

48:05.137 --> 48:08.262
If you want to go to jail, fine.

48:08.304 --> 48:10.827
If you can't give me a good reason,

48:10.903 --> 48:14.392
I will call the lmmigration.

48:14.471 --> 48:16.438
I'm a good man, Senay.

48:16.504 --> 48:19.164
I know where to draw the line.

48:20.238 --> 48:22.727
I don't want to take your virginity, Senay.

48:22.805 --> 48:26.931
I just want you to help me to relax.

48:36.806 --> 48:40.705
You have such a beautiful mouth, Senay.

48:47.908 --> 48:49.396
Achtung! Achtung!
(Attention!)

48:49.476 --> 48:51.873
My ladies and gentlemen,
your coach awaits.

48:51.942 --> 48:54.340
Please. Please.

48:54.409 --> 48:57.672
But you must take your own
luggage to the coach.

48:57.742 --> 49:00.537
Please. Thank you. Good evening.

49:00.609 --> 49:05.099
I will help only those
who cannot carry their own bags.

49:05.176 --> 49:07.608
Okwe, get up here.

49:13.644 --> 49:16.075
- This man is a doctor.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

49:16.144 --> 49:18.474
She's okay.
She only needs to rest a minute.

49:18.544 --> 49:21.033
He qualified in Lagos.

49:21.113 --> 49:23.874
He worked for the Nigerian government.

49:23.945 --> 49:27.878
His name is Dr. Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe.

49:27.946 --> 49:31.071
We must hurry or we'll miss the coach.

49:39.780 --> 49:40.746
In the end,

49:40.813 --> 49:44.610
I find out everything
about everyone in this place.

49:46.215 --> 49:49.648
Here.
Take a look at this.

49:49.715 --> 49:52.704
French.
It's a work of art.

49:52.782 --> 49:55.748
There are two Lebanese I use
who are the best in London.

49:55.815 --> 49:57.543
You give them a photograph...

49:57.615 --> 50:01.048
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Señor Juan.

50:01.117 --> 50:05.446
If you were just some African,
the deal would be simple.

50:05.516 --> 50:08.880
You give me your kidney,
I give you a new identity.

50:08.950 --> 50:11.883
I sell the kidney for 10 grand,
so I'm happy.

50:11.951 --> 50:15.747
The person who needs the kidney
gets cured, so he's happy.

50:15.817 --> 50:17.647
The person who sold his kidney

50:17.718 --> 50:21.116
gets to stay in this beautiful
country, so he's happy.

50:21.184 --> 50:25.049
My whole business is based on happiness.

50:25.119 --> 50:30.450
But for you,
Dr. Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe,

50:30.519 --> 50:33.542
I've a better idea.

50:33.619 --> 50:36.609
I do not want to get involved,
Señor Juan.

50:36.687 --> 50:41.449
Each time you operate,
you get £3,000.

50:41.520 --> 50:45.511
A passport for you and one for Senay.

50:45.588 --> 50:46.884
Take her on honeymoon.

50:46.955 --> 50:50.046
I do not want to get involved.

50:50.122 --> 50:53.054
You could even go back to Africa.

50:53.122 --> 50:56.487
And no one would know who the fuck you are.

50:58.223 --> 50:59.654
Your choice.

50:59.722 --> 51:01.711
No rush.

51:01.789 --> 51:07.984
Just wanted to put a little wasp in your head.

51:18.557 --> 51:20.421
Unusual.

51:20.492 --> 51:24.185
Chinese guy with no family.

51:24.258 --> 51:27.419
Maybe he's from the back of a truck.

51:29.059 --> 51:33.287
I cut off his buttons so his spirit can escape.

51:33.359 --> 51:35.291
I'm sewing up his pockets

51:35.359 --> 51:40.315
so he can't take his bad luck
with him to the spirit world.

51:40.394 --> 51:41.791
If he's an atheist,

51:41.861 --> 51:45.294
I'm ruining a suit no one will ever see.

51:45.361 --> 51:49.123
If he's a Buddhist,
I'm giving him eternal happiness

51:49.194 --> 51:51.057
for the price of a piece of thread.

51:51.128 --> 51:54.118
I have found out why the heart was at the room.

51:54.195 --> 51:56.683
They are removing kidneys.

51:57.329 --> 51:59.887
One of their patients died at their hands.

51:59.963 --> 52:02.554
Another, I treated for
a staphylococcal infection.

52:02.629 --> 52:05.357
You're treating people?

52:05.463 --> 52:06.951
I hope you charge.

52:06.996 --> 52:09.155
Did you hear what I said?

52:09.230 --> 52:13.925
There's nothing so dangerous as a virtuous man.

52:13.997 --> 52:15.986
Well, Okwe,
if you're so concerned,

52:16.064 --> 52:17.758
you should go to the police.

52:17.831 --> 52:19.228
Get yourself deported.

52:19.297 --> 52:22.627
Do you think if it were for
deportation I would not do it?

52:22.698 --> 52:25.221
I'm a wanted man, Guo Yi!

52:26.832 --> 52:28.889
Wanted for what?

52:32.765 --> 52:37.164
Okwe, you didn't know people sold their organs?

52:38.233 --> 52:40.722
- Not here.
- What do you mean, 'here'?

52:40.800 --> 52:43.699
Here in London you think it doesn't happen

52:43.767 --> 52:45.756
because the queen doesn't approve?

52:45.834 --> 52:48.766
I heard in London it's 10 grand for a kidney.

52:48.834 --> 52:51.891
For that, people take risks.

52:51.968 --> 52:55.731
If I had the courage,
I'd sell my kidney.

52:55.802 --> 52:58.563
Just to get out of here.

52:59.136 --> 53:02.534
Just to save my brain.

53:54.841 --> 53:56.774
The problem with being on time

53:56.841 --> 53:59.865
is that you can always be tracked down.

53:59.943 --> 54:02.238
What do you think of the girl?

54:02.309 --> 54:05.504
She's my next customer.
8 years old.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.303
She's called Rima.

54:07.343 --> 54:11.639
Her family brought her over
from Saudi hoping for a miracle.

54:11.710 --> 54:16.075
If she doesn't get the new
kidney, she's going to die.

54:17.277 --> 54:19.210
The doctor we use is no good.

54:19.277 --> 54:20.607
If he fucks up again,

54:20.677 --> 54:23.905
there'll be another heart down the lavatory.

54:27.112 --> 54:30.544
Okwe?
You still there?

54:31.845 --> 54:34.368
So I'm an evil man, right?

54:34.446 --> 54:37.344
But I'm trying to save her life.

54:37.412 --> 54:39.379
That's weird, huh?

54:39.447 --> 54:42.811
Kind of thing that keeps you awake at night.

54:53.047 --> 54:57.105
Tonight, London is colder than Moscow.

54:57.182 --> 55:00.114
I heard it on the radio.

55:25.452 --> 55:26.849
Okwe?

55:27.818 --> 55:32.219
It is a crazy idea,
but we really can do it.

55:32.285 --> 55:34.411
You said you liked New York.

55:34.487 --> 55:39.714
But if not New York, then maybe
Boston or Los Angeles.

55:39.786 --> 55:43.184
I'm going there, Okwe.
What do you think?

55:43.254 --> 55:46.186
And, Okwe,
you could go there, too.

55:47.287 --> 55:51.152
Senay, are you okay?

55:51.221 --> 55:53.153
Senay, where are you?

55:53.221 --> 55:55.380
What has happened?

56:38.326 --> 56:40.848
I knocked,
but you did not hear me.

56:42.426 --> 56:44.449
Senay, are you okay?

56:45.227 --> 56:47.852
Senay, what has happened?

56:47.927 --> 56:50.416
The factory does not suit me.

56:50.494 --> 56:54.483
My hands are too soft.
I cut my fingers.

56:54.561 --> 56:59.153
So I have decided to go to America.

57:01.128 --> 57:03.186
For America,
you would need a visa.

57:06.329 --> 57:08.954
Or maybe a European passport.

57:10.530 --> 57:13.496
- You keep away from Señor Juan!
- It is like taking out a tooth.

57:13.563 --> 57:15.359
He's lying, Senay!

57:15.430 --> 57:18.260
Because you are poor, you will
be gutted like an animal.

57:18.330 --> 57:20.796
They will cut you here,
or they will cut you here.

57:20.864 --> 57:22.796
They will take what they want.

57:22.864 --> 57:26.024
One of the laundry girls did it.
And now she's free.

57:26.098 --> 57:27.758
Others are dead, Senay!

57:27.832 --> 57:29.798
So they are free, too.

57:29.865 --> 57:31.763
What would your God say?

57:33.432 --> 57:35.660
My God does not speak to me anymore.

57:35.733 --> 57:37.722
Don't break, Senay.

57:37.799 --> 57:39.230
Save money.

57:39.299 --> 57:41.993
Keep New York in your head and work hard.

57:43.966 --> 57:47.262
You know what kind of work I do?

57:58.301 --> 58:00.200
Lunch!

59:09.743 --> 59:13.506
Okwe, somebody's in
the back room looking for you.

59:13.576 --> 59:16.509
She look like a film star, boy.

59:22.810 --> 59:23.935
Senay!

59:24.011 --> 59:28.341
Look, Okwe, I know for sure
that this coat costs £300.

59:28.411 --> 59:30.468
- And this dress...
- Tell me what has happened.

59:30.545 --> 59:33.034
We can sell the coat for £200.

59:33.112 --> 59:35.704
Senay, where did you get these?

59:35.779 --> 59:37.369
I bit, Okwe.

59:38.146 --> 59:40.408
At the factory.

59:40.479 --> 59:43.105
He said he would report me to lmmigration.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.544
And he made me suck.

59:45.613 --> 59:48.273
But today, I bit.

59:48.346 --> 59:49.973
I bit.

59:51.447 --> 59:53.470
I bit.

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:21.174
Señor Juan sometimes has rooms in the hotel.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.273
No, Senay.

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.340
- Just for tonight.
- No.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.679
Through there is hot water and a shower.

01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:29.718
Hurry, Senay.

01:00:32.718 --> 01:00:35.684
What is this place, Okwe?

01:00:36.286 --> 01:00:39.446
It is a place where you can stay for tonight.

01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:41.212
So cold.

01:00:41.286 --> 01:00:45.219
If anyone comes,
you are a friend of Guo Yi.

01:01:06.556 --> 01:01:09.522
Tomorrow we will find you somewhere to live.

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:23.888
So... it is in there.

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:31.516
I can hear it.

01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:34.951
Your heart.

01:02:44.366 --> 01:02:46.195
Hello.
Room service.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:02.728
Buenos dias, negro.

01:03:11.936 --> 01:03:14.425
Come on.
Come on!

01:03:21.304 --> 01:03:23.668
She is nil by mouth the whole day.

01:03:23.737 --> 01:03:25.396
Please.

01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:31.734
Sister.

01:03:31.804 --> 01:03:33.998
Help me, brother.

01:03:38.472 --> 01:03:41.700
Stop acting like you've got a choice.

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:47.837
Please!

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.997
Put on your clothes.

01:03:50.073 --> 01:03:52.232
Son of a bitch!

01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:55.069
You came in a truck,
but you're going home in chains!

01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:57.834
- They'll deliver you like meat!
- No!

01:04:00.508 --> 01:04:04.066
The whole world is wrong except you, Okwe?

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:06.902
What?
What, Okwe?

01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:11.898
You are going to cut me up and flush me away?

01:04:11.976 --> 01:04:13.203
Huh?

01:04:47.546 --> 01:04:49.978
I really don't know you at all,
do I, Okwe?

01:04:50.047 --> 01:04:52.513
- This is Senay. She is a friend.
- I'm not your friend.

01:04:52.581 --> 01:04:55.411
- She's been out here all night.
- I would rather freeze to death

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.946
than go into that building again.

01:04:57.014 --> 01:04:59.037
You know, there are mornings I feel the same.

01:04:59.114 --> 01:05:00.205
Come.
It's cold.

01:05:00.281 --> 01:05:02.406
This is the house of the dead, Okwe!

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.470
They're all dead!

01:05:05.683 --> 01:05:07.545
Okwe.

01:05:09.182 --> 01:05:11.171
Maybe this will help.

01:05:11.249 --> 01:05:14.647
My cousin has a room in Chinatown.

01:05:14.716 --> 01:05:17.080
I guess there's space for two.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:23.675
You know, Okwe, good at chess
usually means bad at life.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.012
You do realize that she's
in love with you, don't you?

01:05:27.084 --> 01:05:30.812
I've been with her 20 minutes,
and I know it.

01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:34.317
But then, I'm bad at chess.

01:05:42.819 --> 01:05:45.115
Senay, there is something I must tell you.

01:05:45.186 --> 01:05:47.879
- This is your religion?
- I have no religion.

01:05:47.954 --> 01:05:49.613
Senay.

01:05:51.086 --> 01:05:53.644
You have stopped chewing the leaf.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.743
I can see it in your eyes.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.912
You know, Okwe,
your eyes are quite pretty.

01:05:58.987 --> 01:06:02.715
- They're not bad-looking.
- Senay, listen to me.

01:06:04.754 --> 01:06:07.550
I come to this churchyard often.

01:06:07.622 --> 01:06:11.850
I come here to be alone
and to think about my wife.

01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:16.247
So now you see.

01:06:16.323 --> 01:06:18.516
What do I see?

01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:20.783
You should not see me anymore.

01:06:24.923 --> 01:06:26.890
Do you love her?

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:27.924
Do you love her?

01:06:27.991 --> 01:06:29.617
There is a room above a restaurant.

01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:31.657
Immigration police do not go into Chinatown.

01:06:31.724 --> 01:06:33.350
- You will be safe.
- Do you love her?

01:06:33.425 --> 01:06:35.118
Here's money for the rent I owe you.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:38.022
There is more for the trouble
I have caused you.

01:06:38.092 --> 01:06:40.183
- Do you love her?
- Love?

01:06:42.992 --> 01:06:46.516
For you and I,
there is only survival.

01:06:47.659 --> 01:06:51.114
It is time you woke up from your stupid dream.

01:07:19.129 --> 01:07:20.356
Yes?

01:07:22.363 --> 01:07:24.159
Senay.

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:28.522
Are you going on holiday or something?

01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:32.556
Señor Juan.

01:07:41.932 --> 01:07:43.193
Señor Juan.

01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:44.959
America, maybe?

01:08:02.801 --> 01:08:03.732
Come on.

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:06.062
You cleaned up their shit so long.

01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.590
Now you can be one of them.

01:09:07.874 --> 01:09:10.033
Who is it?

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:14.131
It's me.
I got some paperwork.

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:17.834
Okay.
How old are you?

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:19.307
22.

01:09:19.376 --> 01:09:21.341
How old do you want to be?

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.103
22.

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:26.841
Hey, Come on.
Relax.

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.706
I can make you whatever you want.

01:09:28.777 --> 01:09:31.207
You want to be Spanish?
Or Greek?

01:09:31.277 --> 01:09:32.765
Italian.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:35.104
You're going to need a new name.

01:09:35.178 --> 01:09:37.701
Isabella Encarico.

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:39.243
You're sure that's Italian?

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:42.005
She owns a café in New York.

01:10:08.248 --> 01:10:11.238
Okay.
You are at New York lmmigration.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:12.441
What's your name?

01:10:12.515 --> 01:10:14.481
Isabella Fontana Encarico.

01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:16.572
- How old are you?
- 22.

01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:18.581
- Where were you born?
- Napoli.

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.774
- Where in Napoli?
- Arenella.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.748
Right.

01:10:23.817 --> 01:10:27.647
The trick, Senay, is to believe
you are the new person.

01:10:27.717 --> 01:10:31.480
If you believe it inside, then
the lmmigration will believe it.

01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:33.608
Drink, Senay?

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:41.581
What are you afraid of?
Okwe's gone.

01:10:41.652 --> 01:10:44.118
Got scared and go away.

01:10:46.119 --> 01:10:47.948
Go to hell.

01:10:50.086 --> 01:10:52.985
This is hell.

01:10:53.054 --> 01:10:55.746
I'm helping you to get away.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.911
Take off your robe.

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:58.544
Come on.
Come on.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.143
Hey, hey!
Stop! Stop that!

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.448
Stop that!

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.816
I can't believe it!

01:11:04.921 --> 01:11:07.410
I'm arguing like you are my fucking wife!

01:11:07.455 --> 01:11:09.580
Let me explain something, Senay.

01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:14.247
Your robe, now, is what the
Americans call a 'deal breaker.'

01:11:14.322 --> 01:11:15.982
So...

01:11:16.056 --> 01:11:17.544
No.

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:23.386
You are this close to New York,
and you said no.

01:11:41.359 --> 01:11:42.915
Wait.

01:11:47.693 --> 01:11:51.147
I want the whole thing.
That's the deal.

01:11:51.226 --> 01:11:53.317
Take it or leave it.

01:11:54.993 --> 01:11:57.824
You do not see me.

01:11:57.893 --> 01:12:00.451
You just do.

01:12:00.527 --> 01:12:02.390
Take it or leave it.

01:12:37.365 --> 01:12:39.990
So it wasn't so bad, huh?

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.826
Nothing to cry about.

01:12:41.898 --> 01:12:44.228
I'm not crying.

01:12:44.299 --> 01:12:47.924
If you told me it was the first
time, I'd have cut a ribbon.

01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:55.260
I can't believe Okwe never fucked you.

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:57.731
You kind of love him, huh?

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.732
Women love men most who don't love them back.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.529
Well, you had a lucky escape.

01:13:05.635 --> 01:13:08.261
You know why he ran away?

01:13:11.868 --> 01:13:14.300
Because I found out that in Africa,

01:13:14.369 --> 01:13:16.562
he murdered his own wife.

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.701
You don't eat or drink for 24 hours, okay?

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.429
Doctor's orders.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:58.799
Senay is here?

01:14:00.641 --> 01:14:02.732
Senay is here?

01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:21.268
Senay.

01:14:31.143 --> 01:14:33.302
I will need a pill.

01:14:36.578 --> 01:14:40.341
There is a pill you can take the morning after.

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.243
You're a doctor.

01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:48.302
At least you can get me a pill.

01:15:27.616 --> 01:15:30.378
I won't allow you to butcher her.

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:32.382
You won't allow?

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:35.211
I will operate on her myself.

01:15:35.284 --> 01:15:36.615
You'll do what?

01:15:36.684 --> 01:15:38.412
I will do it.

01:15:38.484 --> 01:15:41.451
It is the only way I can be sure
she will not die.

01:15:43.351 --> 01:15:45.874
In return, I want a passport.

01:15:45.952 --> 01:15:48.009
A new identity.

01:15:49.019 --> 01:15:51.917
Well, holy shit.

01:15:51.985 --> 01:15:53.952
So you are human, Okwe?

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.077
I will bring you our photographs
tomorrow morning.

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:08.576
Hi. I'm Juliette.
I'm a friend of Okwe's.

01:16:08.655 --> 01:16:11.450
He said that you needed these.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:20.311
So, he did not care enough
to bring them himself.

01:16:20.389 --> 01:16:23.322
Oh, Okwe's an angel.

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:36.715
There.
Never happened.

01:16:42.292 --> 01:16:45.690
So, what did happen?

01:16:51.525 --> 01:16:55.720
Before, I was a virgin.

01:16:55.793 --> 01:16:57.725
Jesus.

01:16:57.793 --> 01:16:59.418
Mohammed.

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:12.654
What a pair.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:15.353
The virgin and the whore.

01:17:23.396 --> 01:17:26.590
- Boss?
- The doctor needs a good car.

01:17:28.996 --> 01:17:31.860
Take it.
Last time, you were lucky.

01:17:33.597 --> 01:17:35.460
Black is black.

01:17:56.632 --> 01:17:59.497
Wash these again.
Please.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.728
Boil, boil, eh?
Hot, hot.

01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:36.427
Oh, dear.

01:18:38.671 --> 01:18:42.229
So this is how you do it right.

01:18:42.305 --> 01:18:45.237
There can be no guarantee against E. Coli.

01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:49.369
Wonderful.

01:18:49.438 --> 01:18:50.631
Oh, yes.

01:18:50.705 --> 01:18:52.762
No, no.

01:19:03.874 --> 01:19:07.772
Passports.
It's something I do right.

01:19:20.442 --> 01:19:22.032
No parking.

01:19:22.108 --> 01:19:24.472
Okwe wants me to wait here.

01:19:26.676 --> 01:19:29.541
I gave her a sedative an hour ago.

01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:32.008
She's only in a deep sleep.

01:19:32.076 --> 01:19:36.442
But now you are here, I can
administer the anesthetic.

01:19:36.511 --> 01:19:37.908
Now I'm here?

01:19:37.977 --> 01:19:40.808
You are going to be my assistant, Señor Juan.

01:19:40.878 --> 01:19:42.343
What the fuck is this?

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:45.242
I have noticed that if you
do not drink, your hands shake.

01:19:45.312 --> 01:19:46.709
When you pass me the scalpel,

01:19:46.778 --> 01:19:49.973
I do not want you to cut off my fingers.

01:19:53.779 --> 01:19:56.245
Where will they come to collect?

01:19:58.713 --> 01:20:01.372
If you faint,
I will have only half an hour

01:20:01.446 --> 01:20:03.571
before the kidney begins to deteriorate.

01:20:03.646 --> 01:20:07.807
They come to the laundry bay.
Back of the kitchen.

01:20:08.882 --> 01:20:10.574
You better start.

01:20:10.647 --> 01:20:12.545
Go and scrub your hands.

01:20:12.614 --> 01:20:17.274
Yes. Professional.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.037
It's decided.

01:20:21.115 --> 01:20:23.479
It's fucking decided.

01:20:23.549 --> 01:20:27.481
You and me are going into business.

01:20:29.382 --> 01:20:31.974
You know washing dishes?

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:37.348
You know when you forget
on Friday and come in Monday,

01:20:37.417 --> 01:20:40.316
and there is a pan with sauce?

01:20:40.384 --> 01:20:41.781
White. Green.

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:42.838
Shit.

01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:45.645
That is...

01:20:45.718 --> 01:20:48.775
How they do things in the city.

01:20:52.352 --> 01:20:54.147
Jesus.

01:20:54.218 --> 01:20:56.946
Was I speaking English then?

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.212
What you say?

01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:03.116
Why do you say?

01:21:03.219 --> 01:21:04.742
Senay.

01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:20.117
I don't understand it,
how the ice will help.

01:21:20.188 --> 01:21:21.654
Make you last longer, babe.

01:21:21.722 --> 01:21:24.745
I don't want to last longer.
It's not even payday.

01:21:24.822 --> 01:21:27.380
All right.
Make you harder.

01:21:28.723 --> 01:21:31.951
Think what happens to water
when it freezes, huh?

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.485
There.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.318
Get a bucket.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:38.856
Bucket?

01:21:39.824 --> 01:21:41.915
Come on!

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:46.583
Okwe, you have removed kidneys before?

01:21:46.658 --> 01:21:48.214
Many times.

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.087
In pathology.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.250
What is pathology?

01:21:52.326 --> 01:21:55.087
It means the patient is already dead.

01:21:56.292 --> 01:21:58.884
Did he tell you things about me, Senay?

01:22:00.926 --> 01:22:02.824
No.

01:22:10.027 --> 01:22:13.482
Let me wipe your brow, Doctor.

01:22:29.063 --> 01:22:32.188
Juliette, put the ice
on the bed and put on the gown.

01:22:39.432 --> 01:22:41.192
Take the bag.

01:22:41.264 --> 01:22:42.696
Squeeze.

01:22:42.764 --> 01:22:44.127
Gently.

01:22:44.931 --> 01:22:46.794
We must go and scrub up.

01:22:53.899 --> 01:22:55.762
Cold tonight, huh?

01:22:58.633 --> 01:23:03.622
On the night like this,
who would want so much ice?

01:23:06.267 --> 01:23:09.097
You are Pylades.

01:23:09.167 --> 01:23:11.030
Pylades was the boatman

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.863
who ferried the souls to the land of the dead.

01:23:14.934 --> 01:23:16.264
If you didn't put a coin

01:23:16.335 --> 01:23:18.528
under the tongue of your dead relative,

01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:21.328
Pylades wouldn't take them to Hades

01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:24.697
no matter how good you had been in your life.

01:23:40.937 --> 01:23:41.925
Knife.

01:23:51.072 --> 01:23:52.561
Oh, Jesus.

01:23:52.638 --> 01:23:54.901
Juliette, you are not allowed to faint.

01:24:39.885 --> 01:24:40.908
Is that it, then?

01:24:40.985 --> 01:24:42.645
No, no.
I must sew him up.

01:24:42.719 --> 01:24:44.208
Why?

01:24:46.453 --> 01:24:48.443
Fetch me stitches.

01:24:57.454 --> 01:25:00.648
Juliette, will you go and check
there is no one else waiting?

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:01.812
Yeah.

01:25:18.556 --> 01:25:20.920
Where's Señor Juan?

01:25:21.023 --> 01:25:22.784
He's drunk.

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:51.587
How come I've never seen you people before?

01:25:51.659 --> 01:25:54.989
Because we are the people you do not see.

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.754
We are the ones who drive your cabs.

01:25:57.827 --> 01:25:59.850
We clean your rooms.

01:25:59.927 --> 01:26:02.052
And suck your cocks.

01:26:18.996 --> 01:26:20.859
In one hour, call an ambulance.

01:26:20.963 --> 01:26:23.054
Send them up to Room 510.

01:26:23.096 --> 01:26:24.562
Juliette.

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.018
Thank you.

01:26:27.097 --> 01:26:28.892
Shh.
It's okay.

01:26:28.964 --> 01:26:30.986
- One hour.
- Okay.

01:26:42.165 --> 01:26:45.429
Handa?
Handa, it's me... Senay.

01:26:45.499 --> 01:26:47.465
You hear how good my English is?

01:26:47.533 --> 01:26:49.021
I'm coming to New York.

01:26:49.099 --> 01:26:52.032
I'm coming to New York!
I'm coming to New York!

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.498
- My hands are shaking.
- So are mine.

01:26:54.566 --> 01:26:56.192
I don't have a driver's license.

01:26:56.267 --> 01:26:58.199
Hey. It's dead.

01:26:58.267 --> 01:26:59.733
It's the tunnel.

01:26:59.801 --> 01:27:02.029
I must tell her what time we land.

01:27:02.101 --> 01:27:04.192
Senay, what Sneaky told you was true.

01:27:04.268 --> 01:27:05.790
He did not tell me anything.

01:27:05.867 --> 01:27:08.993
I did not kill my wife myself,
but still it was my fault.

01:27:09.069 --> 01:27:11.968
- I was a pathologist in Lagos.
- Now we are someone new.

01:27:12.035 --> 01:27:13.830
A government official was shot.

01:27:13.902 --> 01:27:16.027
I was told to destroy the evidence.

01:27:16.102 --> 01:27:18.898
When I refused,
my house was firebombed.

01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.935
My wife was still inside.

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:24.767
The police charged me with her murder.

01:27:27.437 --> 01:27:29.835
I had to run.

01:27:29.904 --> 01:27:32.097
But my daughter stayed.

01:27:32.171 --> 01:27:36.536
Valerie.
She's with my sister in Lagos.

01:27:37.038 --> 01:27:39.334
How old is she?

01:27:39.905 --> 01:27:42.133
7.

01:27:42.938 --> 01:27:44.905
I must go to her.

01:28:31.277 --> 01:28:33.437
Tell me about Lagos.

01:28:33.511 --> 01:28:36.636
Do they have hotels that need maids?

01:28:38.311 --> 01:28:39.834
When you arrive at the airport,

01:28:39.912 --> 01:28:43.810
you will see a whole line of yellow cabs.

01:28:43.879 --> 01:28:46.242
The car will take you across a bridge.

01:28:47.112 --> 01:28:49.943
When you have crossed the river,
you will see

01:28:50.013 --> 01:28:52.173
lights in the trees.

01:28:53.013 --> 01:28:55.344
Policemen on white horses.

01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:56.935
No.

01:28:59.647 --> 01:29:02.637
I know that it won't be like that.

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:08.446
Goodbye, Okwe.

01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:26.644
Senay.

01:29:29.017 --> 01:29:30.983
Hold me.

01:29:33.884 --> 01:29:37.180
You must go.
Isabella.

01:29:37.251 --> 01:29:39.876
Always we must hide.

01:29:46.052 --> 01:29:49.143
This is the café where my cousin works.

01:30:57.094 --> 01:30:59.582
I love you.

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.691
Hello?

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.493
Valerie.

01:32:06.867 --> 01:32:08.731
Yes, it's me.

01:32:11.668 --> 01:32:13.328
At last.

01:32:16.102 --> 01:32:18.433
I'm coming home.

01:33:22.408 --> 01:33:27.773
' Now I'm wakin' at the crack of dawn '

01:33:27.842 --> 01:33:33.298
' To send a little money home from here, too '

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:38.899
' The moon is risin' like a discotheque '

01:33:38.977 --> 01:33:44.466
' And now my bags are down
and packed for travelin' '

01:33:44.543 --> 01:33:48.637
' Lookin' at happiness,
keepin' my flavor fresh '

01:33:48.711 --> 01:33:54.803
' Nobody knows, I guess,
how far I'll go, I know '

01:33:54.878 --> 01:33:59.539
' So I'm leavin' at 6 o'clock,
meet in a parking lot '

01:33:59.613 --> 01:34:04.477
' Have in your hand a shot,
sunglasses on '

01:34:04.546 --> 01:34:13.207
' She waits by this glass
and concrete and stone '

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:21.339
' It is just a house,
not a home '

01:34:21.415 --> 01:34:26.814
' Skin that covers me from head to toe '

01:34:26.883 --> 01:34:32.474
' Except a couple tiny holes and openings '

01:34:32.549 --> 01:34:37.812
' Where the city's blowin' in and out '

01:34:37.884 --> 01:34:43.475
' And this is what
it's all about, delightfully '

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:47.347
' Everything's possible when you're an animal '

01:34:47.417 --> 01:34:53.681
' Not inconceivable
how things can change, I know '

01:34:53.751 --> 01:34:56.615
' So I'm puttin' on after-shave '

01:34:56.685 --> 01:34:58.515
' Nothing is out of place '

01:34:58.585 --> 01:35:00.575
' Gonna be on my way '

01:35:00.652 --> 01:35:03.140
' Try to pretend '

01:35:03.219 --> 01:35:12.381
' It's not only glass and concrete and stone '

01:35:12.453 --> 01:35:20.410
' And it's just a house,
not a home '

01:35:34.123 --> 01:35:41.648
' And it's glass and concrete and stone '

01:35:41.723 --> 01:35:48.885
' It is just a house,
not a home '

01:35:48.958 --> 01:35:56.323
' And my head is 50 feet high '

01:35:56.391 --> 01:36:05.018
' Let my body and soul be my guide '
