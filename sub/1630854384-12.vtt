00:00.800 --> 00:02.302
[Andi]<i> Sabrina's coming out.</i>

00:02.302 --> 00:04.170
[Fatima]<i> Previously on Sistas.</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:05.638
Sabrina Hollins did it.

00:05.638 --> 00:08.975
You testify against her
and we will let you walk.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.378
Well, I won't be doing that,
so next deal.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.747
You know he may not be at your
company for much longer.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.115
What does that mean?

00:15.115 --> 00:16.716
Well, you know how corporate
things are

00:16.716 --> 00:18.118
after a hostile takeover.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.086
It looks like the baby was
conceived on the twelfth.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.021
Who were you with on the
twelfth, Zac or Aaron?

00:22.021 --> 00:23.456
[Andi]<i> Karen?</i>

00:23.456 --> 00:25.291
Why would you lie on me to the
police?

00:25.291 --> 00:28.661
You need to get the -- out.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.662

Stop Calvin!
Calvin, stop.

00:36.028 --> 00:37.963
Put your hands on her again,
mother--

00:37.963 --> 00:41.233
-Get your phone, Sabrina.
-What, what, why?

00:41.233 --> 00:43.068
So, we can record him.
Get your phone.

00:43.068 --> 00:44.803
Calvin.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.405
[Calvin]<i> -- it, I'll get it.</i>

00:46.405 --> 00:48.874
<i>Here, now your ass is going to
tell the truth</i>

00:48.874 --> 00:50.743
<i>or I'ma -- kill you.</i>

00:50.743 --> 00:52.945
Tell the truth.

00:52.945 --> 00:56.315
[laughing] I ain't saying shit.

00:56.315 --> 00:58.150
Alright, you don't want to tell
the truth.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.085
You don't want to talk, alright.

01:00.085 --> 01:01.453
-[unintelligible]
-[screaming]

01:01.453 --> 01:04.223
No, no, Calvin, you're gonna
kill him. Stop.

01:04.223 --> 01:06.091
-Get out, Que.
-I'm trying.

01:06.091 --> 01:07.526
-Get out.
-No.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.328
-Que, get out.
-Don't let him leave.

01:09.328 --> 01:11.096
-He needs to go.
-Dawg, my back.

01:11.096 --> 01:14.500
[Sabrina]<i> Get out, get up.</i>

01:14.500 --> 01:16.502
<i>Hurry up!</i>

01:16.502 --> 01:19.238

01:19.238 --> 01:20.806
Get out, Que, now.

01:20.806 --> 01:23.342
This ain't over bruh, I promise

01:30.549 --> 01:33.051
You better get yo ass outta here

01:33.051 --> 01:38.190
Okay, you got lucky, Light Skin,
you got lucky.

01:38.190 --> 01:41.427
Get out now, Que.

01:41.427 --> 01:42.761

01:46.698 --> 01:48.066
Shit.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.468

02:10.591 --> 02:12.025
Are you okay?

02:12.025 --> 02:14.128
Yeah, yeah, I'm just sick of
that --

02:14.128 --> 02:16.730
-and his bull shit.
-I know, I know.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.398
But he's gone now.

02:18.398 --> 02:20.033
But that's not gonna help,
Sabrina.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.435
What?

02:21.435 --> 02:23.504
You shouldn't have let him
leave.

02:23.504 --> 02:25.639
Wh-what?
He's not gonna tell the truth.

02:25.639 --> 02:28.509
Damn, Sabrina, now Maurice is
locked up.

02:28.509 --> 02:31.078
But it's, it's not like it was
gonna help anyway.

02:31.078 --> 02:32.579
What are you talking about?

02:32.579 --> 02:35.482
-It would've.
-He was under duress.

02:35.482 --> 02:37.017
What?

02:37.017 --> 02:39.686
You, he was under duress.

02:39.686 --> 02:42.322
Even if you got a confession it
would not have helped.

02:42.322 --> 02:45.392
You were beating him with a golf
club.

02:45.392 --> 02:47.794
--.

02:47.794 --> 02:50.063
Shit.

02:50.063 --> 02:52.733
It's okay, it's okay, you tried.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.234
Are you sure you're okay?

02:54.234 --> 02:57.070
I'm sorry, I should be asking
you that.

02:57.070 --> 02:59.273
I'm fine.

02:59.273 --> 03:01.942
Thank you for protecting me.

03:01.942 --> 03:03.544
Okay, but that mother--

03:03.544 --> 03:07.848
I know, I know,
but he's gone now.

03:07.848 --> 03:09.416
It's okay.

03:16.723 --> 03:19.493
Wow.

03:19.493 --> 03:21.662
Okay.

03:21.662 --> 03:24.765
If you don't want to tell us,
you don't have to.

03:24.765 --> 03:27.968
-Mm-mm, no.
-Danni.

03:27.968 --> 03:30.370
Why wouldn't she want to tell
us?

03:30.370 --> 03:34.007
You know what, maybe she needs
more time.

03:34.007 --> 03:37.711
-[Danni]<i> No.
-</i> [Andi]<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

03:37.711 --> 03:39.413
Well, what are you doing?

03:39.413 --> 03:42.816
I'm going down the calendar.

03:42.816 --> 03:44.284
[sighs]

03:44.284 --> 03:47.554
[Andi]<i> Oh, wait, oh right,
[unintelligible].</i>

03:47.554 --> 03:49.223
You can tell by the calendar?

03:49.223 --> 03:51.058
I thought you didn't want to
know.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.759
I, I kinda do wanna know.

03:52.759 --> 03:54.394
Just, uh...

03:54.394 --> 03:57.364
Respectfully, it would be
interesting.

03:57.364 --> 03:59.933
I remember, you know, I.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.368
It's Zac's baby.

04:14.314 --> 04:18.185
Um, are you sure?

04:18.185 --> 04:19.920
Mm-hmm.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.156
Yeah.

04:23.156 --> 04:25.492
Okay.

04:25.492 --> 04:28.428
So, you can go ahead and tell
your friend that.

04:28.428 --> 04:30.297
Oh, don't do me like that.

04:30.297 --> 04:32.032
[Karen]<i> Don't act like you
won't.</i>

04:32.032 --> 04:34.234
I am not gonna tell her that.

04:39.239 --> 04:44.645
Okay, well, it's Zac's baby.

04:44.645 --> 04:47.581
You know, I still think it's
uncertain, you know,

04:47.581 --> 04:50.717
'cause it was in that seven day
window.

04:50.717 --> 04:52.185
Right?

04:52.185 --> 04:55.088
Look, I always knew it was his.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.556
Mm, okay.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.560
Okay, yep.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.029
Mm-hmm.

05:02.029 --> 05:06.400
So, um, are you going to tell
him?

05:06.400 --> 05:11.171
Well, um, I'm gonna go back to
the salon

05:11.171 --> 05:12.606
and think about it.

05:15.409 --> 05:18.345
She said ease back into your
schedule. So, are you sure?

05:18.345 --> 05:21.381
Yes, I'm sure, Andi, I need to
work.

05:21.381 --> 05:23.950
Really, I do.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.953
Well, I, too, must go back to
work. So, you know.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.222
Wait, uh, I have an idea.

05:29.222 --> 05:30.657
What?

05:30.657 --> 05:34.494
Why don't we all go to my place
and we can think

05:34.494 --> 05:38.832
and talk about the information
that we received, today, here.

05:38.832 --> 05:40.267
Mm-hmm.

05:40.267 --> 05:42.436
-As a collective.
-Mm-hmm, like a hive mind.

05:42.436 --> 05:45.105
Mm-hmm.
Community.

05:45.105 --> 05:46.506
-Yeah.
-[Andi]<i> Okay.</i>

05:46.506 --> 05:48.575
-I'm okay with that.
-Me too, alright.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.481
See you at your place.

05:54.481 --> 05:55.882
Okay, see you tonight.

05:59.186 --> 06:00.754
Okay.

06:08.895 --> 06:10.330
[sighs]

06:12.699 --> 06:15.068
Are you okay?

06:15.068 --> 06:16.570
Yep.

06:19.373 --> 06:23.276
You beat the hell out of him
with that club.

06:23.276 --> 06:25.679
You don't think he deserved it?

06:25.679 --> 06:27.681
I don't want you to go to jail.

06:27.681 --> 06:29.483
[laughs]

06:29.483 --> 06:31.451
I wish that -- would try.

06:35.389 --> 06:38.024
Thank you.

06:38.024 --> 06:41.595
No, I got you, anything for you.

06:44.631 --> 06:47.467
Danni told me what you were
trying to do

06:47.467 --> 06:49.569
with the money to help me.

06:49.569 --> 06:51.371
Yeah, but she never called me.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.975
I didn't need it.

06:57.477 --> 07:01.281
I'm just glad that you're out.

07:01.281 --> 07:05.919
Thank you, but...

07:05.919 --> 07:07.754
I know, I know.

07:07.754 --> 07:09.723
You're worried about Maurice.

07:09.723 --> 07:10.957
So am I.

07:13.894 --> 07:16.463
Have you heard from him?

07:16.463 --> 07:20.033
Nah, he hasn't called me.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.902
Really?

07:21.902 --> 07:25.372
You know how Maurice is.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.073
What?

07:27.073 --> 07:28.942
You know he gets down on
himself.

07:28.942 --> 07:34.080
He probably thinks all of this
shit is his fault.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.883
[sighs] Yeah, you're right.

07:36.883 --> 07:39.853
This shit's crazy.

07:39.853 --> 07:41.354
I know.

07:41.354 --> 07:44.891
I told his ass not to get with
that dude.

07:44.891 --> 07:46.426
I know.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.094
Now, look where it got him.

07:51.164 --> 07:53.300
I know.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.402
And you.

07:59.973 --> 08:02.609
We have to do
something to help him.

08:02.609 --> 08:04.411
Yeah, but what can we do?

08:07.547 --> 08:11.485
I don't know, maybe uh, I'll ask
Andi.

08:11.485 --> 08:13.253
She did help me.

08:13.253 --> 08:15.055
So, maybe she can help him.

08:15.055 --> 08:18.091
You think she will?

08:18.091 --> 08:22.462
I don't know, but I'm gonna ask.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.798
Okay, good.

08:24.798 --> 08:26.433
I just wish he would call me.

08:28.602 --> 08:33.106
He will, just give him time.

08:33.106 --> 08:35.942
What if he calls you first?

08:35.942 --> 08:38.812
I'll let you know.

08:38.812 --> 08:40.113
Okay.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.018
You know I love your hair like
that?

08:45.018 --> 08:46.486
You know, natural.

08:49.923 --> 08:51.958
Thank you.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.494
I do, too.

08:56.596 --> 09:01.501
I just don't like that it wasn't
my choice to change it.

09:01.501 --> 09:04.571
I get that.

09:04.571 --> 09:06.139
He's gonna call you.

09:08.441 --> 09:10.410
Okay.

09:10.410 --> 09:13.380
[sighs] I'm gonna go.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.881
I'll see you later.

09:14.881 --> 09:16.983
Where you going?

09:16.983 --> 09:18.451
I need to rest,

09:18.451 --> 09:21.488
and um, handle a couple things.

09:21.488 --> 09:24.124
Yeah, I get that.

09:24.124 --> 09:26.726
But you know I could help you,
if you need anything.

09:31.932 --> 09:34.234
I got it.

09:34.234 --> 09:37.003
Okay.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.838
Let me know.

09:38.838 --> 09:43.109
If he calls me, you will be the
first call I make.

09:43.109 --> 09:46.346
Thank you.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.381
Sabrina.

09:48.381 --> 09:50.750
Hmm?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.953
I'm really glad you're out.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.592
So am I.

10:07.167 --> 10:08.501
I'll see you later.

10:08.501 --> 10:09.970
Alright.

10:19.312 --> 10:21.881
[sighs]

10:27.520 --> 10:29.255
Hey, this is Fatima.

10:29.255 --> 10:30.924
Yes.

10:30.924 --> 10:32.792
Yeah, you can send him on back.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.494
Alright, thanks.
Bye.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.839
Don't be smiling at me like
that.

10:45.839 --> 10:47.440
-[Fatima]<i> Hey.
-What's up?</i>

10:47.440 --> 10:50.310
Nothing, what are you doing
here?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.612
So, this is your office, huh?

10:52.612 --> 10:55.448
Yes, this is my office.

10:55.448 --> 10:57.951
But you didn't answer my
question.

10:57.951 --> 11:00.520
-I just came to talk to you.
-Well, okay.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.355
Then, it must be important for
you to come

11:02.355 --> 11:04.357
in the middle of the day.

11:04.357 --> 11:06.693
I went to see the attorney.

11:06.693 --> 11:09.496
Mm, and what did she say?

11:09.496 --> 11:11.064
The same thing you said.

11:11.064 --> 11:12.799
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

11:12.799 --> 11:14.834
She said I should
talk to Heather

11:14.834 --> 11:20.073
and talk Karen and if
the baby is mine,

11:20.073 --> 11:21.975
I should try to work something
out with Karen

11:21.975 --> 11:24.411
so she don't come after me.

11:24.411 --> 11:26.513
That's a good lawyer.

11:26.513 --> 11:28.615
I guess.

11:28.615 --> 11:32.118
-So, you cool with it?
-Yeah, yeah.

11:32.118 --> 11:35.121
Alright, so, I'ma go by the
salon

11:35.121 --> 11:38.124
and talk to Karen and try to see
if I can figure out, 'cause...

11:38.124 --> 11:43.229
Mm-mm, yeah, I ain't cool with
that.

11:43.229 --> 11:46.666
Fatima, you literally just said
you was cool with it, like.

11:46.666 --> 11:49.202
Yeah, I'm cool with Karen coming
to our house

11:49.202 --> 11:51.337
to talk to both of us.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.239
Okay, that's fair.

11:53.239 --> 11:54.841
[Fatima]<i> Alright.</i>

11:54.841 --> 11:57.610
[Zac]<i> But what about Heather?</i>

11:57.610 --> 12:00.814
What Zac, you trying to go to
the strip club to talk to her?

12:00.814 --> 12:03.249
Hell yeah, you know how much
work, I, I'm just joking.

12:03.249 --> 12:06.152
Don't eve--, I'm just joking.
I'm joking.

12:06.152 --> 12:07.687
[Fatima]<i> Then where?</i>

12:07.687 --> 12:11.057
I was thinking, get this,

12:11.057 --> 12:15.695
I invite Heather by the house to
talk about the kid.

12:15.695 --> 12:17.363
[Fatima]<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

12:17.363 --> 12:19.332
-Together.
-With us, together.

12:19.332 --> 12:22.202
You didn't let me finish. Talk
about the kid together with us.

12:22.202 --> 12:23.636
-See?
-Uh-huh.

12:23.636 --> 12:25.105
-[Zac]<i> Yeah.
-I see you learn fast.</i>

12:25.105 --> 12:26.840
-[Zac]<i> Of course, I do.
-I like that.</i>

12:26.840 --> 12:30.009
I learned from you.
And thank you.

12:30.009 --> 12:31.745
For what?

12:31.745 --> 12:36.683
Just being solid and cool with
all of this.

12:36.683 --> 12:39.719
Seriously, like, it's a lot.

12:39.719 --> 12:42.355
It is, but look, Zac, until you
give me something

12:42.355 --> 12:46.993
to really lose my shit over,
this is who I am.

12:46.993 --> 12:48.361
I know.

12:48.361 --> 12:51.297
Mm-hmm, and you know I can
really lose my shit.

12:51.297 --> 12:52.632
-I know.
-Okay.

12:52.632 --> 12:54.100
I know.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.704
Alright so, just tell me what
they say.

12:57.704 --> 13:00.573
Right, right, I still gotta talk
to 'em.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.609
I mean, unless you want me to
call 'em.

13:02.609 --> 13:03.943
I can call and set everything
up.

13:03.943 --> 13:05.512
-[Zac]<i> You?
-Yeah.</i>

13:05.512 --> 13:07.781
You, you gonna call them?

13:07.781 --> 13:10.817
Fatima, they gonna hang up on
you so fast.

13:10.817 --> 13:14.220
Zac, I can be very persuasive.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.223
We don't need your type of
persuasion.

13:17.223 --> 13:20.627
Guns and knives and fists and
blood and death,

13:20.627 --> 13:21.928
we don't need that.

13:21.928 --> 13:24.597
This needs a gentle touch.

13:24.597 --> 13:26.166
Gentle touch?

13:26.166 --> 13:27.967
Not from me,
I'm not touching nobody.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.302
[Fatima]<i> Yeah,
you better not be.</i>

13:29.302 --> 13:31.037
I know, 'cause every time I
touch somebody,

13:31.037 --> 13:32.705
-they get pregnant, so.
-Exactly, mm-hmm.

13:32.705 --> 13:34.908
-[Zac]<i> I'm not touching nobody.
-Perfect.</i>

13:34.908 --> 13:37.210
So, when do you want me to get
them to come over?

13:37.210 --> 13:39.946
Sooner the better, because this
-- Hayden is...

13:39.946 --> 13:41.548
Did I hear my name?

13:41.548 --> 13:43.449
This -- like a damn
leprechaun.

13:43.449 --> 13:46.853
- -- troll.
-What's up, Zac?

13:46.853 --> 13:49.856
Hayden, don't come in my office.

13:49.856 --> 13:51.758
I'm not in your office.

13:51.758 --> 13:53.359
Leave.

13:53.359 --> 13:55.762
Y'all know I'm the one with the
restraining order, right?

13:55.762 --> 13:58.298
Yeah, one that you can't
enforce.

13:58.298 --> 13:59.732
You know what?

13:59.732 --> 14:01.234
You are right about that.

14:01.234 --> 14:02.635
That is true.

14:02.635 --> 14:04.070
So, why are you still standing
there?

14:04.070 --> 14:06.339
Well, I saw your little
boyfriend come in

14:06.339 --> 14:09.442
and I realized
he saved me some money.

14:09.442 --> 14:10.844
Here you go, Zac.

14:10.844 --> 14:12.946
You have, officially,
been served.

14:12.946 --> 14:17.283
-Man, you...
-I wish you would do something.

14:17.283 --> 14:20.119
You wanna explain to this
criminal over here,

14:20.119 --> 14:23.056
that whether he takes or not,
all these witnesses out here

14:23.056 --> 14:27.360
are gonna say he's been served.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.862
[Fatima]<i> Are you done?</i>

14:28.862 --> 14:30.296
Yeah, I'm done.

14:30.296 --> 14:33.132
-I'll see y'all in court.
-[Zac]<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

14:35.301 --> 14:38.304
His breath always smell like
that when he come in here?

14:38.304 --> 14:39.839
Zac.

14:39.839 --> 14:42.275
[Zac]<i> You don't got no windows
in this office?</i>

14:42.275 --> 14:43.776
I'm, I'm just...

14:43.776 --> 14:46.813
You not taking him seriously,
are you?

14:46.813 --> 14:48.314
-Come on, man.
-This is serious.

14:48.314 --> 14:50.383
It's not serious, I, I ain't
taking this.

14:50.383 --> 14:51.985
[Fatima]<i> Zac, you need to take
that.</i>

14:51.985 --> 14:53.453
I'm not taking that.

14:53.453 --> 14:56.322
Well, if you don't, I'm gonna
look at it.

14:56.322 --> 14:58.224
Do what you gotta do.

14:58.224 --> 15:00.760
You the one that's gonna be a
lawyer, anyway.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.930
Zac, just take it and take it to
your lawyer.

15:03.930 --> 15:05.999
Fatima, if I take this, then he
gonna win.

15:05.999 --> 15:11.471
-I'm not touching that.
-Zac, stop, he's not worth it.

15:11.471 --> 15:13.373
Shit.

15:13.373 --> 15:16.809
Look, just try to talk to her
before this --

15:16.809 --> 15:19.445
makes shit worse.

15:19.445 --> 15:22.115
Fine, fine.

15:22.115 --> 15:24.250
Okay.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.753
I shoulda hit him with this.
That's what I shoulda did.

15:26.753 --> 15:28.388
-Zac.
-I got you.

15:28.388 --> 15:29.923
You can't always resort
to violence, okay?

15:29.923 --> 15:31.824
-I got you.
-Let me, let me do that.

15:31.824 --> 15:33.359
-[Andi]<i> Zac?
-[Fatima] Oh, shit.</i>

15:33.359 --> 15:35.762
-What's up, Andi?
-[Fatima]<i> Hey.</i>

15:35.762 --> 15:37.230
Hi.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.898
-[Zac]<i> Just leaving.
-[Andi] Were you?</i>

15:38.898 --> 15:40.333
Yes, he was.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.135
Okay, well,
it's good to see you.

15:42.135 --> 15:43.970
[Fatima]<i> Mm-mm, babe,
Andi's right there.</i>

15:43.970 --> 15:46.306
-This is your office.
-And that's my boss.

15:46.306 --> 15:48.207
-[Andi clears her throat]
-She ain't even knock.

15:48.207 --> 15:50.043
-Can we have a second?
-[Fatima]<i> Zac, don't.</i>

15:50.043 --> 15:51.678
-No.
-I'm just playing.

15:51.678 --> 15:53.046
-[Andi]<i> Yeah.
-Babe, go.</i>

15:53.046 --> 15:55.214
-I'll see you at home.
-I can't touch you.

15:55.214 --> 15:56.983
You might get pregnant.
Bitches be getting pregnant.

15:56.983 --> 15:59.152
-[Fatima]<i> Go, Zac, bye.
-What is he talking about?</i>

15:59.152 --> 16:02.922
Girl, it's a lot going on,
today.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.257
Bitches be getting pregnant?

16:04.257 --> 16:05.858
But I have everything you need.

16:05.858 --> 16:07.894
Um, I have the information on
Jack Morris.

16:07.894 --> 16:09.996
The deposition has been set for
seven.

16:09.996 --> 16:11.664
Um, the Andle case is on your
desk.

16:11.664 --> 16:13.333
Okay.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.435
Tomorrow, you have a meeting at
4pm with Finley and Matthews.

16:15.435 --> 16:18.938
And the Pace account has finally
been moved up.

16:18.938 --> 16:20.373
Look at you.

16:20.373 --> 16:22.709
I know I had company, but I got
my work done.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.010
You did.
Thank you very much.

16:24.010 --> 16:25.545
-Absolutely.
-You good?

16:25.545 --> 16:26.946
-I am.
-Um, is Robin in?

16:26.946 --> 16:28.314
Yeah, yeah, he's here.

16:28.314 --> 16:30.149
Okay, alright, I'm gonna go talk
to him.

16:30.149 --> 16:31.517
-Okay.
-See you later.

16:31.517 --> 16:33.186
-Alright, have a good day.
-Thanks for everything.

16:33.186 --> 16:34.721
-Absolutely.
-Alright, bye.

16:34.721 --> 16:36.856
Bye.
[sighs] Okay, let's see.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.260
[knock at door]

16:41.260 --> 16:42.528
Come in.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.566
Hi.

16:46.566 --> 16:49.836
How'd it go?

16:49.836 --> 16:52.338
She's out.

16:52.338 --> 16:55.475
Are you sure she's not gonna
run?

16:55.475 --> 16:57.844
I'm sure.

16:57.844 --> 16:59.178
I'm counting on you.

16:59.178 --> 17:01.014
You can count on me.

17:04.417 --> 17:07.186
Robin?

17:07.186 --> 17:09.655
Is this about business?

17:09.655 --> 17:12.291
[laughs] Shut up.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.360
I'm just following your lead.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.862
You started it.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.330
Alright, sit down.

17:23.636 --> 17:25.772
I know I was an asshole.

17:25.772 --> 17:27.440
Beyond.

17:27.440 --> 17:31.177
[laughs] I guess I thought you'd
be used to it,

17:31.177 --> 17:33.713
given who you're seeing.

17:33.713 --> 17:35.181
Really?

17:35.181 --> 17:40.019
I'm sorry, I'm in a
very pissy mood.

17:40.019 --> 17:41.654
I can see that.

17:41.654 --> 17:43.056
What's wrong?

17:45.124 --> 17:49.729
So, I took on a lot of leverage
to buy this firm.

17:49.729 --> 17:51.597
I thought it was a great deal.

17:51.597 --> 17:53.166
It, it is.

17:53.166 --> 17:57.270
It is, unless you have partners
who are forcing a call.

17:59.572 --> 18:01.040
Are they?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.442
You know what a call is?

18:02.442 --> 18:05.011
It's when the majority does a
capital raise

18:05.011 --> 18:08.448
and every member has to put into
the pot.

18:08.448 --> 18:12.618
-I expected you to know.
-Yeah. [laughs]

18:12.618 --> 18:16.622
Well, my portion of that is 14
million dollars.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.294
Is that a problem?

18:23.796 --> 18:25.198
At this time, it is.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.168
I see.

18:37.494 --> 18:42.365
So, I just, I've been really
stressed about that because

18:42.365 --> 18:46.002
now, I'm down another million
helping your friend.

18:46.002 --> 18:47.504
Of course.

18:47.504 --> 18:49.739
Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry about
it.

18:49.739 --> 18:51.341
No, no, no, it's, it's fine.

18:51.341 --> 18:53.376
I mean, if, if I can't raise 14
million,

18:53.376 --> 18:55.545
one million's not gonna help
either.

18:55.545 --> 18:56.846
It's alright.

18:56.846 --> 19:00.650
I, um, I am shocked that they
would do this so soon

19:00.650 --> 19:04.654
but it's clear they're trying to
force me out.

19:04.654 --> 19:07.591
They being you know who.

19:07.591 --> 19:09.759
I don't know.

19:09.759 --> 19:11.761
[Robin]<i> Come on, Andi, you know.</i>

19:11.761 --> 19:13.230
[Andi]<i> Robin.</i>

19:13.230 --> 19:15.732
[laughing] You're not lying very
well.

19:15.732 --> 19:18.168
I've been told.

19:18.168 --> 19:21.271
Gary and Hayden.

19:21.271 --> 19:24.608
They're behind it.
They think I don't know.

19:24.608 --> 19:26.643
I'm sorry.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.446
You didn't know?

19:29.446 --> 19:32.649
[sighs] Well, I'm not sure how
he convinced the partners

19:32.649 --> 19:36.386
to do it, but Gary's pretty
slick.

19:38.788 --> 19:41.157
He's very cunning.

19:41.157 --> 19:43.860
[sighs] That's why he's been so
happy.

19:43.860 --> 19:47.897
Inviting me up and everything,
he's got me in a chess move

19:47.897 --> 19:50.200
and he knows it.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.235
I'm sorry.

19:52.235 --> 19:54.971
It's alright, it is what it is.

19:54.971 --> 19:58.008
Unless.

19:58.008 --> 20:00.210
What?

20:00.210 --> 20:02.012
Nevermind.

20:02.012 --> 20:04.314
No, go on.

20:04.314 --> 20:08.518
I know someone who could
probably get you the money

20:08.518 --> 20:12.222
but it may have crazy interest.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.494
Go on.

20:17.494 --> 20:19.629
And you may get your arms
broken.

20:19.629 --> 20:21.197
Okay, damn.

20:21.197 --> 20:24.167
I'm just saying.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.669
Who is this?

20:25.669 --> 20:29.372
It's a client I repped
in a divorce.

20:29.372 --> 20:31.207
He was really weird about his
money, I mean,

20:31.207 --> 20:35.545
his wife was even afraid
to spend a dime.

20:35.545 --> 20:39.382
But he said that um,
he did loans.

20:39.382 --> 20:40.984
Are you trying to get me killed?

20:40.984 --> 20:44.554
Of course not.
I'm just...

20:44.554 --> 20:47.223
I'm trying to help you
like you helped me.

20:47.223 --> 20:50.760
I don't like that
they were trying to game you.

20:52.362 --> 20:53.763
Well, you're worth it.

20:55.965 --> 20:57.734
Is that a compliment?

20:59.169 --> 21:02.572
If I lose this company,
I have others.

21:02.572 --> 21:05.041
So yeah, it's a compliment.

21:05.041 --> 21:08.745
Well, I'm not a prize
in a game.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.482
I know you're not.

21:12.482 --> 21:15.518
And I don't like being made
to feel that way.

21:17.020 --> 21:18.488
You're not.

21:19.289 --> 21:21.691
I'm sorry if you do.

21:23.326 --> 21:25.795
Do you want the number?
Or not?

21:27.397 --> 21:29.332
I'll think about it.

21:29.332 --> 21:33.837
Well, I don't want you
to lose this place.

21:33.837 --> 21:35.305
Thank you.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.777
So, fight it.

21:42.979 --> 21:45.482
Thank you.

21:56.726 --> 21:58.695
[music]

22:01.331 --> 22:03.833
-Hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.602
[sigh] How you doing?

22:05.602 --> 22:07.971
Amazing.

22:07.971 --> 22:09.339
Oh, is it slow in here?

22:09.339 --> 22:11.307
No, but they're handling it.

22:11.307 --> 22:13.777
Oh, okay, good.

22:13.777 --> 22:16.346
You working today?

22:16.346 --> 22:18.081
I actually just went to the
doctor

22:18.081 --> 22:19.949
and um, they said I could.

22:19.949 --> 22:21.384
That was fast.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.353
I know, I'ma call my momma and
tell her.

22:23.353 --> 22:25.088
So, y'all can all relax, okay?

22:25.088 --> 22:26.790
Okay.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.158
Is Aaron here yet?

22:28.158 --> 22:30.360
No, is he coming?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.262
I told him to meet me, so.

22:32.262 --> 22:33.930
[Pam]<i> Oh, well, he ain't here
yet.</i>

22:33.930 --> 22:35.398
Okay.

22:35.398 --> 22:37.801
So, am I putting clients on your
books?

22:37.801 --> 22:39.235
Please do.

22:39.235 --> 22:42.005
Are you working all hours?

22:42.005 --> 22:45.208
They told me not to push it, but
I gotta catch up.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.977
-So, yes.
-Okay, well, I will book away.

22:47.977 --> 22:49.345
Thank you, please do.

22:49.345 --> 22:51.448
I'ma make a call in the
back real quick.

22:51.448 --> 22:53.950
-[Pam]<i> Okay.
-Okay, thanks.</i>

22:53.950 --> 22:56.252
I like that dress, girl.

22:56.252 --> 23:00.323
-Well, thank you.
-[Aaron]<i> Hey.</i>

23:00.323 --> 23:02.492
Ah, damn.

23:02.492 --> 23:05.795
-What?
-You look like a little puppy.

23:05.795 --> 23:07.397
What?

23:07.397 --> 23:10.500
She said come and Aaron come
running.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.002
Okay, look Pam, I'm not ashamed
of wanting to make sure

23:13.002 --> 23:14.704
she's taken care of, okay?

23:14.704 --> 23:18.508
Well, where can I get myself a
rescue?

23:18.508 --> 23:20.009
Is she back there?

23:20.009 --> 23:21.444
Yeah, she back there.

23:21.444 --> 23:23.279
-Okay, thank you.
-Of course.

23:23.279 --> 23:25.548
[sighs]

23:32.789 --> 23:34.591
Hey.

23:34.591 --> 23:37.460
Uh, look, I um, I need a favor.

23:40.396 --> 23:44.901
No, no, no, no, I don't need
anybody dead, today.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.871
Okay?
But thank you.

23:47.871 --> 23:53.977
Listen, I um, I need the baddest
gold digging bitch you can find.

23:53.977 --> 23:57.247
Oh, you know one.

23:57.247 --> 23:58.681
Okay, great.

23:58.681 --> 24:01.584
Have her come by the office
and ask for Hayden.

24:01.584 --> 24:03.853
Yeah, tell her that she's
looking to sue someone

24:03.853 --> 24:07.323
who hit her in a car wreck.
Alright, good.

24:07.323 --> 24:10.226
Listen, I need this to work,
alright?

24:10.226 --> 24:14.297
And if she's fine, I know this
-- will take the case.

24:14.297 --> 24:16.432
Yeah, and tell her I want her to
take him

24:16.432 --> 24:20.336
for everything he's got.

24:20.336 --> 24:21.804
Alright.

24:21.804 --> 24:24.908
Alright, just when she gets here
have her call me.

24:24.908 --> 24:26.676
Thanks, bye.

24:29.746 --> 24:31.614
[sighs]

24:35.251 --> 24:38.955
This sounded serious, so.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.723
It is.

24:40.723 --> 24:43.560
First of all, the doctor said
that I'm okay

24:43.560 --> 24:46.596
to come back to work as long as
I don't over do it.

24:46.596 --> 24:49.666
-Well, that's great news.
-Yeah, it is.

24:52.835 --> 24:54.637
It's Zac's baby?

24:58.942 --> 25:00.410
[sighs] Yes.

25:03.513 --> 25:06.449
And you're sure?

25:06.449 --> 25:09.218
Well, the doctor said it's not
100 percent

25:09.218 --> 25:11.854
but she's pretty confident.

25:14.524 --> 25:15.959
[sighs] Okay.

25:18.161 --> 25:19.662
How do you feel about it?

25:22.332 --> 25:25.535
I'm a little disappointed.

25:25.535 --> 25:27.070
But it's fine.

25:27.070 --> 25:32.141
And more importantly, how are
you feeling?

25:32.141 --> 25:35.111
I'm okay.

25:35.111 --> 25:36.479
Really?

25:36.479 --> 25:40.483
Yeah, really.

25:40.483 --> 25:44.921
Look, my momma making me sit in
all this

25:47.323 --> 25:50.627
is really helping.

25:50.627 --> 25:52.729
You're really cool with this?

25:52.729 --> 25:57.867
Well, um, I still gotta talk to
him about it, but yeah.

25:57.867 --> 26:01.004
Yeah, well, how do you think
you're gonna feel

26:01.004 --> 26:03.306
when you do that?

26:03.306 --> 26:05.008
I don't know.

26:05.008 --> 26:07.076
But, as of right now,
I feel fine.

26:10.213 --> 26:13.383
Okay.

26:13.383 --> 26:16.519
So, how can I support you?

26:20.223 --> 26:22.659
You need to stop.

26:22.659 --> 26:24.927
-What?
-You're too good.

26:24.927 --> 26:26.295
Really, you are.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.131
Nah, I'm just being me.

26:28.131 --> 26:31.134
Well, you is good.

26:34.937 --> 26:36.305
Shall we eat?

26:36.305 --> 26:39.409
Yes, please.

26:39.409 --> 26:41.711
Let's see what I've got in here
for you.

26:48.118 --> 26:52.689
So, uh, when are you gonna talk
to him?

26:52.689 --> 26:54.825
I don't know.

26:54.825 --> 26:59.329
But I'm gonna talk to the girls
tonight, see what they think.

26:59.329 --> 27:01.131
That's a good idea.

27:04.601 --> 27:08.138
What do you think?

27:08.138 --> 27:12.109
I think if you stay calm, stay
focused,

27:12.109 --> 27:13.944
it'll be alright.

27:13.944 --> 27:17.614
That's easier said than done.

27:17.614 --> 27:19.750
It can be difficult.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.953
But it can be done.

27:22.953 --> 27:25.122
True.

27:25.122 --> 27:26.523
[knock at door]

27:26.523 --> 27:29.659
-And you can do it.
-Come in.

27:29.659 --> 27:31.261
Hey, Sabrina's out there.

27:31.261 --> 27:32.829
Oh, send her in.

27:32.829 --> 27:34.264
Okay.

27:34.264 --> 27:35.665
So, I'll see you tonight?

27:35.665 --> 27:37.534
Yes, you will.

27:37.534 --> 27:39.403
Okay.

27:39.403 --> 27:43.940
Listen, are you sure you're
okay?

27:43.940 --> 27:46.076
Yeah.

27:46.076 --> 27:51.214
What's not to love about a baby
that's coming through you?

27:51.214 --> 27:54.584
Okay, thank you.

27:54.584 --> 27:56.720
I'm fine, I'll see you tonight.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.022
-See you tonight.
-Alright.

28:05.762 --> 28:07.397
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:07.397 --> 28:08.832
How are you?

28:11.701 --> 28:16.173
Um, I'm okay.

28:16.173 --> 28:17.908
You don't seem okay.

28:22.045 --> 28:24.514
I'm traumatized.

28:24.514 --> 28:28.185
I'm violated.

28:28.185 --> 28:30.954
They stripped search me
and made me cut my hair.

28:33.089 --> 28:36.760
Brina.

28:36.760 --> 28:42.566
I'm just, I, I want you to put
it back.

28:42.566 --> 28:45.235
You want me to put it back the
way it was.

28:45.235 --> 28:46.636
Yes.

28:46.636 --> 28:48.238
Okay.

28:48.238 --> 28:51.408
I like your natural hair.

28:51.408 --> 28:52.676
Thank you, Pam.

28:52.676 --> 28:54.611
I do, too.

28:54.611 --> 28:57.147
That's not what this is about.

28:57.147 --> 29:00.050
So, what is it?

29:00.050 --> 29:01.485
Pam.

29:01.485 --> 29:04.621
-Go to work.
-Well.

29:04.621 --> 29:06.089
Okay.

29:10.393 --> 29:13.797
Okay, so, you want it to be back
the way it was.

29:13.797 --> 29:15.565
You want the locks, right?

29:15.565 --> 29:19.536
-Yes.
-Okay, we can make that happen.

29:19.536 --> 29:21.171
Yeah.

29:21.171 --> 29:23.273
Thank you.

29:23.273 --> 29:26.176
I'm just, I'm just really mad
because it wasn't my choice.

29:26.176 --> 29:27.511
I know.

29:27.511 --> 29:31.281
I understand that, yeah.

29:31.281 --> 29:33.550
This is so crazy.

29:33.550 --> 29:36.386
I know.

29:36.386 --> 29:39.422
What's going on with Maurice?

29:39.422 --> 29:42.125
He's still in there.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.594
[sighs]

29:44.594 --> 29:50.166
Calvin beat the hell out of Que.

29:50.166 --> 29:53.436
What?

29:53.436 --> 29:58.608
He wouldn't leave the house and
it was a mess.

29:58.608 --> 30:00.210
I mean, everything he's already
done,

30:00.210 --> 30:02.746
I can't believe he's still
acting like that.

30:02.746 --> 30:04.748
I know.

30:04.748 --> 30:08.618
Okay, Brina.

30:08.618 --> 30:10.420
Hmm?

30:10.420 --> 30:14.291
I'm really sorry this is all
happening to you.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.659
I'm gonna be fine.

30:15.659 --> 30:17.460
Yes, you are.

30:19.930 --> 30:22.165
Go pick up hair real quick?

30:22.165 --> 30:23.533
Yes, please.

30:23.533 --> 30:25.802
Okay, come on.

30:25.802 --> 30:27.370
Come on, come on, come on.

30:27.370 --> 30:29.606
Oh, Brina.

30:29.606 --> 30:31.074
It's gonna be alright.

30:45.155 --> 30:46.623
Hey.

30:46.623 --> 30:48.291
Hey, come here, real quick.

30:59.903 --> 31:02.272
So, it's Tamara, right?

31:02.272 --> 31:03.707
Yeah.

31:03.707 --> 31:05.742
Okay, did you already ask for
him?

31:05.742 --> 31:07.377
Not yet.

31:07.377 --> 31:10.146
Okay, let me look at you.

31:10.146 --> 31:12.916
Yeah, you'll work just fine.

31:12.916 --> 31:14.618
What do you mean?

31:14.618 --> 31:16.052
My cousin sent you, right?

31:16.052 --> 31:18.788
Yeah, what you need me to do?

31:18.788 --> 31:21.825
Listen, I need you
to freak this --.

31:21.825 --> 31:23.226
Do you hear me?

31:23.226 --> 31:24.928
And make him
fall in love with you.

31:24.928 --> 31:27.063
-Oh, please.
-What?

31:27.063 --> 31:29.833
That -- a lawyer, I got that.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.434
Okay.

31:31.434 --> 31:34.237
Listen, I need you to tell me
everything that he's up to.

31:34.237 --> 31:35.505
Okay.

31:35.505 --> 31:37.540
[Fatima]<i> And I need you to take
your time</i>

31:37.540 --> 31:39.109
<i>and get him to open up to you.</i>

31:39.109 --> 31:41.077
Okay, what kind of shit is he
into?

31:41.077 --> 31:44.247
Hmm, small mind, small --.

31:44.247 --> 31:45.649
Shit.

31:45.649 --> 31:49.085
Yeah, but, it's fine.

31:49.085 --> 31:52.656
You right, 'cause I will have
Big Jim waiting at home.

31:52.656 --> 31:54.290
Oh, okay.

31:54.290 --> 31:56.926
I didn't need to know all that
but listen.

31:56.926 --> 31:59.896
Please make sure he doesn't know
he's getting played.

31:59.896 --> 32:03.700
You have no idea how good I am
at this, do you?

32:03.700 --> 32:06.903
No, I don't,
because I don't know you.

32:06.903 --> 32:10.106
Madam should have told you
I got this shit.

32:10.106 --> 32:15.612
Okay, see, that right there was
just a little too hood

32:15.612 --> 32:17.814

32:17.814 --> 32:21.785
I'm sorry,
but whatever do you mean?

32:21.785 --> 32:23.119
Well, damn.

Okay, I like that.

32:28.992 --> 32:30.694
But what if he vets you?

33:08.631 --> 33:10.233
This is Hayden.

33:10.233 --> 33:13.703
[Receptionist]<i> Hi, uh, we have a

33:21.578 --> 33:23.313
You're gonna have to make an

33:25.782 --> 33:27.150
-Okay.

Well, I was told that you could

34:13.997 --> 34:15.465
[both laugh]

34:15.465 --> 34:17.901
Well, it's kind of silly but I
just want to see

34:17.901 --> 34:19.702
if I have a case here.

34:19.702 --> 34:23.139
Okay, um, well, I am a lawyer.

34:23.139 --> 34:26.342
So, uh, come back to my office
and we'll figure it out.

34:26.342 --> 34:28.478
-You sure?
-I'm absolutely sure.

34:28.478 --> 34:30.013
Trust me.

34:30.013 --> 34:32.081
I just had a friend that told me
you were great.

34:32.081 --> 34:33.883
Really?
Who told you that?

34:33.883 --> 34:36.219
Oh, she would kill me if I told
you that.

34:36.219 --> 34:38.188
Huh, you can tell me.

34:38.188 --> 34:42.725
No, but she did say you were
cute and sexy.

34:42.725 --> 34:45.261
-She was right.
-Oh, word.

34:45.261 --> 34:46.996
Oh, well, now you definitely
gotta tell me.

34:46.996 --> 34:49.766
I won't but she did say that you
could help me.

34:49.766 --> 34:51.835
I can definitely help you, uh,
right this way.

34:51.835 --> 34:53.269
-Thank you.
-Of course.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.641
[no audible dialogue]

35:12.789 --> 35:16.126
What the hell happened to you?

35:16.126 --> 35:18.361
I got into a fight.

35:18.361 --> 35:21.264
Yeah, you look like you got your
ass beat.

35:21.264 --> 35:22.766
Yeah, and it's all your fault.

35:22.766 --> 35:24.501
[Danni]<i> What the hell are you
talking about?</i>

35:24.501 --> 35:26.269
The dude that was
looking at you crazy.

35:26.269 --> 35:27.604
What about him?
You saw him?

35:27.604 --> 35:30.307
Yeah, I saw him on the street
waiting for you.

35:30.307 --> 35:31.775
-You serious?
-[Que]<i> Yes.</i>

35:34.978 --> 35:37.214
Well, you need to call the
police.

35:37.214 --> 35:40.050
No, it's all cool, I beat that
-- ass.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.585
Quincy.

35:41.585 --> 35:43.019
No, it's all good.

35:43.019 --> 35:46.256
So, what did he do to you?

35:46.256 --> 35:48.625
What makes you think he did
something to me?

35:48.625 --> 35:50.961
He was staring at you.

35:50.961 --> 35:52.996
It's fine.

35:52.996 --> 35:56.600
Yeah, whatever it is, I beat his
ass, so.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.301
Well, damn.

35:58.301 --> 36:00.237
You can thank me at any time
now.

36:00.237 --> 36:04.341
Mm, I told you to leave his ass
alone.

36:04.341 --> 36:06.977
The way he was looking at you,
hell no.

36:06.977 --> 36:09.779
I got you.

36:09.779 --> 36:11.281
Are you sure you okay?

36:11.281 --> 36:13.917
Yeah, I mean um, just my back
and my arms.

36:13.917 --> 36:15.685
I was covering my face.

36:15.685 --> 36:17.754
What did he hit you with?

36:17.754 --> 36:19.189
A baseball bat.

36:21.491 --> 36:26.730
So, you let a injured man beat
your ass?

36:28.965 --> 36:32.168
For a beautiful woman, I would,
yes.

36:32.168 --> 36:34.337
Ah, see, you full of shit.

36:34.337 --> 36:35.805
[Que]<i> No, I'm telling the truth.</i>

36:35.805 --> 36:38.008
No, you probably got bit by a
dog or something.

36:38.008 --> 36:40.443
-I'm telling you, it was him.
-Okay.

36:40.443 --> 36:43.913
Okay, well, I'll walk you to
your car.

36:43.913 --> 36:45.282
I'm fine, it's fine.

36:45.282 --> 36:47.851
Damn woman, let me help you.

36:47.851 --> 36:49.919
I said, I got it.

36:49.919 --> 36:54.691
Okay, fine.

36:54.691 --> 36:58.561
Do you need help to your cart?
Where is your cart?

36:58.561 --> 37:00.897
-No, I got it.
-No, you need a cart.

37:00.897 --> 37:02.399
Yes, I do.

37:05.969 --> 37:07.370
I got it.

37:09.306 --> 37:11.474
You don't look it.

37:17.781 --> 37:19.115
[knock at door]

37:19.115 --> 37:20.850
[Andi]<i> Come in.</i>

37:20.850 --> 37:22.852
-Hey.
-[Andi]<i> Hey.</i>

37:22.852 --> 37:24.154
You need anything else?

37:24.154 --> 37:25.689
-No, I'm good.
-Okay, good.

37:25.689 --> 37:27.857
I'm gonna go on
and get out of here.

37:27.857 --> 37:29.359
What's the rush?

37:29.359 --> 37:31.661
-Girl, these damn shoes.
-Oh, I understand that.

37:31.661 --> 37:34.197
Yes, ah, hurting.

37:34.197 --> 37:37.801
Um, I saw you talking to Robin
earlier today.

37:37.801 --> 37:39.836
How'd that go?

37:39.836 --> 37:41.104
It was good.

37:41.104 --> 37:42.906
Okay.

37:42.906 --> 37:44.407
You good with that?

37:44.407 --> 37:47.877
Yeah, he helped Sabrina.

37:47.877 --> 37:49.145
Oh, well, that's good.

37:49.145 --> 37:51.381
Yeah.

37:51.381 --> 37:52.782
But at what cost?

37:55.552 --> 37:58.755
I know why he was upset now, so.

37:58.755 --> 38:00.790
Andi, that still does not give
him a reason

38:00.790 --> 38:03.059
to talk to you like that.

38:03.059 --> 38:04.761
He's aware of that now.

38:04.761 --> 38:06.296
Okay, good.

38:08.498 --> 38:13.203
Oh, [clears throat] um,
allergies.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.838
-What was that?
-[Andi]<i> What?</i>

38:14.838 --> 38:16.773
That look.

38:16.773 --> 38:18.775
What, what look?

38:18.775 --> 38:21.544
Andi, what is it?

38:21.544 --> 38:24.447
I, nothing, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

38:24.447 --> 38:27.150
No, no, no, you up to something.

38:27.150 --> 38:29.486
I'm gonna figure it out.

38:29.486 --> 38:31.654
Don't look at me like that, I...

38:31.654 --> 38:33.623
What is it?

38:33.623 --> 38:38.128
You're keeping secrets from me,
apparently.

38:38.128 --> 38:39.996
What?

38:39.996 --> 38:41.364
-No.
-What?

38:41.364 --> 38:43.900
No, hmm?
You have no idea?

38:43.900 --> 38:47.036
Because I see a tan line
on your ring finger.

38:47.036 --> 38:48.571
What, what?

38:48.571 --> 38:50.940
What?

38:50.940 --> 38:52.442
-Uh-huh.
-Shit.

38:52.442 --> 38:55.011
Is there something you would
like to talk to me about?

38:55.011 --> 38:57.781
Nope, there is nothing I would
like to talk to you about

38:57.781 --> 39:00.283
'cause girl my feet are hurting.
So, I'ma go ahead and get out.

39:00.283 --> 39:03.319
Oh, I hate that for you.
Sit yo ass down.

39:03.319 --> 39:04.788
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

39:09.359 --> 39:10.860
You tried it.

39:20.770 --> 39:22.105
What?

39:22.105 --> 39:24.474
-Hi.
-What?

39:24.474 --> 39:27.177
I came to see if
you changed your mind.

39:27.177 --> 39:29.479
Changed my mind about what?

39:29.479 --> 39:32.882
Turning on Sabrina.

39:32.882 --> 39:34.951
I'm not doing that.

39:34.951 --> 39:37.687
[John]<i> Well, then this will be a
long stay for you.</i>

39:37.687 --> 39:42.625
Well, that's just what it's
gonna have to be.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.828
You sure?

39:44.828 --> 39:46.796
Why the hell are you even
talking to me?

39:46.796 --> 39:49.199
Didn't we discuss that we would
wait on my lawyer?

39:49.199 --> 39:51.968
We have been waiting for one on
record.

39:51.968 --> 39:54.871
Well, let's keep doing that.

39:54.871 --> 39:56.940
See, you have this wrong.

39:56.940 --> 40:02.545
I can talk to you and you can
choose to remain silent.

40:02.545 --> 40:05.615
Well, that's my choice.

40:05.615 --> 40:08.885
I don't think you're going to be
able to have a lawyer.

40:08.885 --> 40:10.286
You wanna bet?

40:10.286 --> 40:11.654
Court will appoint one for you.

40:11.654 --> 40:14.057
Unless you have the money from
the bank robbery.

40:14.057 --> 40:17.093
I did not rob the bank.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.163
Right, because Sabrina did.

40:20.163 --> 40:22.298
No, she did not.

40:22.298 --> 40:23.800
Well, she -- you.

40:25.902 --> 40:28.505
Well, I have been fingered a few
times in my life.

40:28.505 --> 40:30.073
Never by a woman.

40:30.073 --> 40:31.508
Don't, don't be vulgar.

40:31.508 --> 40:33.776
Oh, bitch, you done been
-- before.

40:33.776 --> 40:35.945
You started it.

40:35.945 --> 40:38.781
You know how she got out?

40:38.781 --> 40:40.583
She got out?

40:40.583 --> 40:42.051
Yes.

40:42.051 --> 40:44.420
She told them that you did it.

40:47.056 --> 40:48.424
No, she didn't.

40:48.424 --> 40:51.194
Yes, she did.

40:51.194 --> 40:54.063
I don't believe you.

40:54.063 --> 40:55.465
Well, you don't have to.

40:55.465 --> 40:57.066
I just wanted you to know.

40:57.066 --> 40:59.269
Good, because I don't.

40:59.269 --> 41:02.405
All you have to do is sign this
paperwork

41:02.405 --> 41:05.775
and you'll be out of here in an
hour.

41:05.775 --> 41:07.110
An hour?

41:07.110 --> 41:09.612
Or less.

41:09.612 --> 41:12.348
Just sign it, Maurice.

41:12.348 --> 41:14.851
I know you're a good guy.

41:14.851 --> 41:16.119
Go ahead and sign.

41:26.884 --> 41:28.185
They want him to give you up.

41:28.185 --> 41:29.787
I'm gonna try
and see Andi tonight.

41:29.787 --> 41:30.854
I'd talk to her quick.

41:30.854 --> 41:32.456
[Danni]<i> Next on Sistas.</i>

41:32.456 --> 41:35.059
She said that you hit someone
with your car.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.427
It's not a big deal.

41:36.427 --> 41:40.130
Danni, you ran someone over.
That's a big deal.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.266
-This is my plant.
-You're what?

41:42.266 --> 41:44.368
She gonna take that -- for
everything he's got.

41:44.368 --> 41:45.936
Do you wanna get a drink with
me?

41:45.936 --> 41:48.706
-Where at?
-My house.

41:48.706 --> 41:50.040
I just really wanna marry you.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.408
You need to talk to Karen first.

41:51.408 --> 41:53.877
[laughs] Did you really just say
that to me?

41:53.877 --> 41:55.112
Yes, I did.

41:55.849 --> 41:59.319
[music]

42:26.107 --> 42:27.709
[music]

42:28.209 --> 42:30.145
[music]
