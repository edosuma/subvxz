WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.034
- We got a 10-33
in marshall court, shots fired,

00:02.169 --> 00:03.769
Officer down.
I need an ambulance now!

00:03.771 --> 00:05.471
- I think I know
where the gun is.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.106
- No serial, untraceable.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.074
Perfect thing to use
if you want to kill a cop.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.477
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:11.479 --> 00:14.113
- You're a liar!
You said you wouldn't tell!
I didn't do anything!

00:14.115 --> 00:15.980
<i> - His fingerprints</i>
<i> were all over the gun,</i>

00:16.017 --> 00:18.583
And now,
maybe sergeant beauchamps
can get some justice?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.419
- Listen, this kid didn't do it.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.120
- Good, prove it.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.889
- That was like old times.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.959
- You are not working with len.
- I can work with len.

00:26.961 --> 00:29.895
- Have you forgotten
how much he messed you up?
Sam was right to call me.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.863
- Friends respect boundaries.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.532
- I'm gonna go home.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.534
'cause at least I've got
a family to go home to.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.937
- No wonder you need a vision
board to connect with people.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.606
- Their drug runner's mother
is deputy mayor marley briggs?

00:41.642 --> 00:44.509
- Your daughter is smuggling
drugs for the pandilla quince.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.679
She stays in our custody.
- She is not a criminal.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.848
You have to let her go.
- They will kill me.

00:49.884 --> 00:53.018
<i> (kelly): Who will?</i>
<i> The sons of jupiter?</i>
<i> The pandilla quince?</i>

00:53.087 --> 00:54.953
- All of them. The coyotes.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.955
- I've got something
in the works.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.157
- What?

01:01.829 --> 01:03.629
- You got another man
I should know about?

01:03.764 --> 01:06.164
- Dozens.
(chuckling)

01:06.233 --> 01:08.166
(phone vibrating)
it's three o'clock!

01:08.235 --> 01:10.168
- And you didn't tell anyone
that you were moving him?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.838
- Nobody. I don't know
what happened.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.773
(len): Adam must've tipped
someone off.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.516
(soft music)

01:29.389 --> 01:31.723
- Oh, sorry.
- My bad.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.259
- Sorry, go, uh...
- Uh, I just wanted to say...

01:34.394 --> 01:36.261
(clears throat)
- please.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.730
- I just wanted to say that
I think it's really important

01:38.732 --> 01:40.265
That we talk about--
- wazowski...

01:40.334 --> 01:42.734
This is not the time to discuss
our personal stuff, okay?

01:42.736 --> 01:43.936
This debrief is about to start.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.737
- I'm really glad
to hear you say that.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.740
I agree.
- You agree?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.076
- I do. We need to focus.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.345
We can't let michaels
beaver-dam us out of this case,

01:53.414 --> 01:55.079
Especially now that
adam gentle got killed.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.448
- Right? I mean, clearly,

01:56.583 --> 01:58.283
This is the coyotes
that adam was talking about,

01:58.285 --> 01:59.751
And if they're behind
his shooting,

01:59.753 --> 02:01.219
Then they probably
could be behind...

02:01.255 --> 02:02.921
- Gabrielle's shooting,
and if we can prove that,

02:02.923 --> 02:03.956
Then we can prove that...

02:04.091 --> 02:05.791
(both): ...Richie clarke
is innocent.

02:07.428 --> 02:11.563
- Huh. So, we are on
the same page.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.299
- After you.
- No, no, go ahead.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.833
- I wouldn't dream of it.

02:21.075 --> 02:22.407
(sighing)

02:24.044 --> 02:25.844
- As we all now know,

02:25.846 --> 02:30.448
Adam gentle was murdered
last night in our custody.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.151
- Survived by one very
hairless dog.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.853
- An embezzler's best friend.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.222
- We know adam gentle
laundered money

02:37.224 --> 02:39.424
For a number of different
criminal enterprises.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.359
- And we're narrowing in
on the mob.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.730
The last call adam made before
his arrest: Niccolo carbone.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.533
- Excuse me, sir.
We have reason to believe
it isn't just the mafia.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.203
- Uh, not following.
- Before he was killed, sir,

02:51.338 --> 02:53.905
Adam implied that there was
a new alliance.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.807
- Yeah, so the mafia, bikers,

02:55.843 --> 02:58.343
And pandilla quince
out of mexico, and
who knows who else.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.878
- He called them
the coyotes, sir.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.713
- This was obviously
a mafia execution.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.949
- No, it was a real thing,
they have their own hand signal.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.417
Look at this. That's a coyote.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.586
- What's that?
- It's got the ears,

03:07.655 --> 03:10.422
And that could be the... Ah!
Like the jaws of it, so...

03:10.557 --> 03:12.190
- If we could just look into
this new syndicate...

03:12.325 --> 03:13.825
- This sounds more like
a conspiracy theory,

03:13.861 --> 03:17.095
Unless I missed something.
Do you have anything concrete?

03:17.131 --> 03:20.798
- Not like concrete, but more
like mushy granite. We have...

03:20.834 --> 03:22.234
- Okay, let's leave this
to homicide,

03:22.236 --> 03:24.436
They'll be taking over
adam's case from here.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.171
And as your new unit commander,

03:27.208 --> 03:29.041
I'll remind you to stay out
of their way

03:29.043 --> 03:31.175
And offer your full cooperation.
- Which is it?

03:31.212 --> 03:33.779
Stay out of their way
or fully cooperate?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.613
- Whichever they need.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.848
(chuckling)

03:38.285 --> 03:41.252
♪ this is the day ♪

03:41.288 --> 03:44.255
♪ your life will
surely change ♪

03:44.291 --> 03:46.925
- Well, that didn't work.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.595
- Shanks would not have
dismissed our theory
about adam's ambush.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.229
- Mm-mm.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.667
Ugh, can you believe that guy?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.936
I bet her seat is still warm.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.472
"do you have anything concrete?"

04:02.843 --> 04:06.078
- Michaels is right.
- Excuse me?

04:07.214 --> 04:08.646
- Listen, we need
something concrete,

04:08.682 --> 04:10.015
Prove that the coyotes are real,

04:10.084 --> 04:11.349
Figure out who
the other players are.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.950
Adam can't be
the only weak link.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.286
- But figuring out
this coyote alliance

04:14.421 --> 04:16.088
Could take weeks, months.

04:16.223 --> 04:19.057
There's gotta be something else
in richie's file.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.126
- Duff, we have read
that file like 100 times,

04:21.128 --> 04:23.095
There is nothing in there!
There's nothing.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.896
- Look, all you have
is the word "coyote".

04:24.965 --> 04:26.865
There's nothing there either.
- Really?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.700
'cause words are things.
You wanna know who said that?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.702
Maya angelou.
- Are you serious...

04:30.738 --> 04:32.971
- Coyote is the closest thing
we have to a suspect

04:33.040 --> 04:34.606
In gabrielle's shooting.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.708
Even if it takes us a little bit
longer to get there,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.743
That thing is the best shot
we have at clearing richie.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.179
- Well, that thing might
as well be a half-court shot.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.649
- Well, I guess
you better do your thing.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.883
- And you'll do yours.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.664
(sighing)

05:03.904 --> 05:05.070
Just...

05:07.474 --> 05:08.906
Okay.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.610
(sighing)

05:14.481 --> 05:16.014
(phone vibrating)

05:16.917 --> 05:18.183
(sighing)

05:20.220 --> 05:21.753
Kelly.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.489
- Let me help you with that.
- No, I got it.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.524
Wait a minute...

05:27.561 --> 05:29.027
(sighing)

05:29.029 --> 05:30.495
Really?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.498
Now I'm starting to forget
why I ever liked you.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.835
- Hey, hey, hey. I'm trying
to respect your space.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.104
I don't know how you're feeling
after last night.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.172
- Oh, looks like
it's a little too late

05:41.241 --> 05:44.442
For you to be worried
about being in my space.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.043
- Well, fine by me.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.246
I'll be right over once I'm done
debriefing your homicide.

05:48.315 --> 05:52.117
- Oh, oh, no, wait.
Actually, you're right, um...

05:52.119 --> 05:55.319
Maybe it's a good idea
that we keep our distance.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.257
Last thing I need is wazowski
seeing us together.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.827
- Ahh... That explains
the stress face.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.531
- I do not have stress face.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.001
But if I did,
it's not about wazowski.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.936
- Mmm.
- Look...

06:12.005 --> 06:14.940
I've been over richie clarke's
files a dozen times, and...

06:15.943 --> 06:17.475
I've got nothing.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.745
- When it feels like you got
nothing, start at the beginning.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.249
Something my sponsor used to say
when I started getting clean.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.485
Pretty sure he got it
from a meme.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.021
- "mr. Clarke has not been
able to provide..."

06:30.023 --> 06:31.556
(gasping)

06:31.558 --> 06:33.224
"...A solid alibi."

06:34.261 --> 06:35.693
I knew I liked you for a reason.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.398
(chuckling)

06:40.167 --> 06:41.499
Thank you.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.140
- Th-that's...

06:50.077 --> 06:50.909
(spitting)

06:50.978 --> 06:52.177
(laughing)
oh my gosh.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.711
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm just great.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.047
I'm really good, it's just
that oatmeal raisin cookies

06:56.083 --> 06:57.582
That look like
chocolate chip cookies

06:57.717 --> 06:59.050
Are the reason
that I have trust issues.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.486
Do I have anything on my...
Am I... That good?

07:01.621 --> 07:02.888
- No, you're good.
- Okay, great.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.523
Are you ready to hear my crazy
coyote theory?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.491
- Oh yeah, I am indeed.
- Okay, good,

07:06.627 --> 07:09.327
Because I have been
doing some digging since
the debrief this morning,

07:09.329 --> 07:12.130
And bam! Okay, wow,
I don't mean "bam" like a gun,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.198
Because that's too soon.
I'm just gonna put that away.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.667
I'm so sorry, mr. Gentle,
apologies.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.802
- Yeah, sure.
Wait, where's kelly?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.003
Isn't she working this with you?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.604
- She's working
on a different lead.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.672
- Okay.
- Okay. So...

07:20.807 --> 07:22.140
- So, what are we
looking at, here?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.742
- Um, okay...

07:23.744 --> 07:26.611
We are looking at a mosaic
of miscellaneous malefactors.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.713
- Say that five times fast.
- Sure, okay.

07:28.749 --> 07:33.084
No, stop. Okay... We've got
airplane antonio, pink cocaine.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.554
Marc tremblay of the sons of
jupiter, also pink cocaine.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.055
Marc tremblay and new wave
mafioso niccolo carbone

07:38.091 --> 07:39.958
Shared adam as accountant,
so I'm betting that niccolo

07:40.027 --> 07:41.793
Was also dealing, what?
Pink cocaine.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.228
Yes!
- I... Okay, maybe.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.964
It doesn't make them
an alliance.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.165
They could all have been buying
separately from mexico.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.567
- Yeah, but remember
what adam said?

07:49.603 --> 07:50.969
He said there's coyotes members
everywhere.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.771
Okay, I want you to check
this out, look at this.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.906
This is text messages
that he sent to marc,

07:54.942 --> 07:57.041
Note the emoji on the bottom,
and this is text messages

07:57.077 --> 07:59.644
That he sent to niccolo.
Look at that! Look at that!

07:59.680 --> 08:01.246
What's on the bottom?
Let me hear you say it!

08:01.315 --> 08:03.114
Oh, it's the same emoji! Yes!

08:03.183 --> 08:05.049
- Okay, so this emoji

08:05.118 --> 08:08.053
Is this alliance's version
of an email signature?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.620
- Ding, ding, ding, ding! Yes!

08:09.656 --> 08:11.456
Yes, you're smelling
what I'm cooking!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.458
Look, it is the same emoji
as the hand gesture.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.328
- Do they touch it, or...
- Ow. That hurt my...

08:16.463 --> 08:18.096
- Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah, they shouldn't bite.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.632
- Okay, so if this is
an alliance,

08:20.767 --> 08:22.901
And if this is their signature,

08:24.171 --> 08:27.705
Sam, this could identify
every player in their network.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.486
(indistinct chatter)

08:42.890 --> 08:44.088
(sighing)

08:49.363 --> 08:50.728
- Okay.

08:52.899 --> 08:57.102
Hey, richie. I brought you
something. Boom.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.138
Remember when we used
to play horse?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.040
We bet a bag of these
every time,

09:02.175 --> 09:04.775
And somehow, you always ended up
going home with them,

09:04.811 --> 09:06.111
Even when you lost.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.448
Look, how you holding up, huh?

09:10.450 --> 09:13.117
Any problems... On the range?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.456
(sighing)
question.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.827
You ever seen either
one of these guys before?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.730
(sighing)

09:25.732 --> 09:27.865
Okay, how about the coyotes?
Ever heard of them?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.167
It's some new gang alliance.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.438
- Is it my turn?
- Yeah.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.475
- Are you dumb?
- Well, that's debatable. Why?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.777
- You're the reason I'm in here.

09:40.847 --> 09:44.482
And now, you're trying
to get me to snitch

09:44.518 --> 09:48.753
On some randoms
I've never seen, to help you.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.354
- Richie, I'm trying
to help you.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.922
Okay, look, you know what?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.160
Forget about those guys.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.629
Listen, where were you
the night of the shooting?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.430
Your file says
you don't have an alibi,

09:59.499 --> 10:01.566
But you had to be somewhere.
(scoffing)

10:03.236 --> 10:06.437
- You know, when you
first walked into
the community centre...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.375
...You talked a big game
about building bridges

10:11.411 --> 10:13.445
Between marshall court
and the cops.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.514
Me, dane, everybody,
we just laughed.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.050
We thought you were crazy.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.387
And then you started coaching
the ball team.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.623
I don't know, for some reason...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.193
...For a second, I thought
I could trust you.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.462
- You can trust me.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.933
And richie, listen, you have to.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.202
'cause if you don't talk to me,

10:37.337 --> 10:40.271
You're gonna spend the next
ten years in a jail cell

10:40.273 --> 10:42.607
For a crime that we both know
you didn't commit.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.845
- So now, I'm just supposed
to trust you...

10:46.980 --> 10:49.480
Because you say I can?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.350
I did.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.021
Look where that got me.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.565
- Hey! You!

11:08.468 --> 11:09.834
Visit's over.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.636
- Wait, wait, go easy, please.
- Let's go.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.572
- Richie, I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

11:14.608 --> 11:15.973
Buddy!

11:19.446 --> 11:23.247
- Okay, bingo ramirez, known
associate of the uptown killerz,

11:23.316 --> 11:27.252
Used the same emoji
to end off a text thread
with adam on may 5th.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.919
(thud)
looks like I'm in the lead.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.388
- No, you're not, you're not.
Stop, wait.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.056
I just... I found something
in adam's file.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.524
Okay, can you look up
will french, please?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.793
- Why do I know that name?

11:37.330 --> 11:41.799
- Oh-la-la! Look at that.
Will french, ah...

11:41.868 --> 11:44.201
I wonder what else he will do.
Do you hear what I did with--

11:44.237 --> 11:45.737
- Very cute.
- Yeah.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.872
- That is right, he is that park
bench real estate agent.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.207
He didn't just sell
the properties, he flips them.

11:50.243 --> 11:54.445
And it looks like
he is having an open house
today... In mimico!

11:54.514 --> 11:56.414
- So, why's this guy using
the coyote emoji?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.015
- Hmm, don't know.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.017
Home purchases,
renovation costs...

12:00.053 --> 12:01.553
Maybe he's a surrogate?

12:01.688 --> 12:03.388
- Maybe squeaky clean will
is buying and selling

12:03.523 --> 12:06.290
Properties for the coyotes to
clean their dirty, dirty money.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.561
What won't will do? Again,
I did the... Did you see?

12:09.696 --> 12:12.230
- Yes, very clever.
- Why don't we look into him

12:12.299 --> 12:13.898
And see if we can find
something on him?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.167
Check out his properties,
see if he's involved.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.535
- Okay.
- Okay, what
are we thinking here?

12:17.670 --> 12:18.803
Like, an intel gathering op?
A bump?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.605
- Oh, are we talking about uc?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.842
Maybe we should wait for duff,
you know, the nicholson.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.912
- No! We should go with
scarborough stu! He's got this!

12:27.914 --> 12:29.647
Besides, bingo put me
in the lead, alright?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.315
I found the most
coyote affiliates.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.451
- I don't think that you did!
Did you look at my list?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.319
I don't remember you going--
- my list was huge!

12:35.388 --> 12:36.554
- Actually... I did.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.723
- Wow.
- He's in the lead.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.924
- That's a lot.
- Nineteen.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.125
- And bingo was his name-o.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.465
- Hey!
- Hey!

12:48.502 --> 12:49.867
- Where is everybody?

12:49.903 --> 12:54.005
- I think barb took the kids out
for ice cream.

12:54.007 --> 12:57.008
- Okay. So, do you want
to go out and eat,

12:57.077 --> 13:00.011
Or you're just gonna lie around
moping about purse boy all day?

13:00.146 --> 13:02.613
- I'm not moping,
I'm broke as a joke.

13:02.682 --> 13:06.417
And plus, barbara said
she was gonna make her secret
pasta sauce later tonight.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.020
- No. The secret is barbeque
sauce, you'd rather starve.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.221
Trust me.
- Okay.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.958
- But luckily,
you don't have to. Money!

13:13.994 --> 13:16.360
- Man, how did you get that?!

13:16.396 --> 13:18.429
- Probably the same way
you got your savings

13:18.498 --> 13:20.331
To pay for your mom's lawyer.
- Okay.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.901
I know hustlers.
Dude, I am one.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.504
- You are not! You are smart,
you are an honour student!

13:26.639 --> 13:28.772
- Yeah, well, honour roll
doesn't pay the bills.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.843
I'm on my own in two months.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.978
Hey, it's fine.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.314
It's just until I save enough
for rent and school.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.383
- Alright, well,
what's the hustle?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.452
- Pretty easy, actually.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.921
This guy I know, tobin,
he just gets me to move stuff

13:43.957 --> 13:45.390
Like, pick up and deliver stuff.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.058
- Deliver what?
- I don't know what's inside.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.895
Hey, tobin said not
to open that.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.530
- Well, I think, personally,

13:52.665 --> 13:54.799
That tobin should try
using reverse psychology.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.433
- Jackie, jackie, don't!

13:58.037 --> 13:59.103
- Huh.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.939
- I picked it up,
and I brought...

14:01.975 --> 14:03.875
I brought it straight here.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.010
Where's whatever's
supposed to be inside?

14:06.145 --> 14:09.013
- Oh, man, I think tobin
got played.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.148
What are you gonna do
now, hustler?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.017
(suspenseful music)

14:13.920 --> 14:15.219
(phone chiming)

14:16.790 --> 14:18.356
- Drop off tomorrow.

14:19.726 --> 14:23.627
It's fine! Tobin knows
I would never rip him off.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.995
I'm gonna handle it.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.833
I'm gonna handle it.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.071
- Listen, I'm here
'cause I want to help richie,

14:33.206 --> 14:34.571
And I know you can help.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.641
I know you can help us
if you just trust me.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.509
- Nah.
- Dane, dane.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.113
Listen,
richie is not doing well.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.116
If you saw something
the night of that shooting,
you can tell me.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.252
Please! Please.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.120
- Are you dumb?
- Apparently, yes!

14:51.057 --> 14:52.323
I'm still asking.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.059
You ever heard of a gang
called the coyotes?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.394
- Yo, why you riding me?

14:56.529 --> 14:57.995
Think I want to end up
like richie?

14:59.532 --> 15:00.732
(dog barking in the distance)

15:01.467 --> 15:02.466
(dane sucking teeth)

15:02.601 --> 15:04.234
- Da--
(sighing)

15:05.739 --> 15:07.271
Hey, crystal,
thanks for meeting me.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.940
- What's this about?
- I need your help...

15:09.876 --> 15:11.542
...With richie.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.810
He won't talk to me!

15:14.547 --> 15:16.214
Come on.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.883
We're friends!
At least we used to be!

15:19.018 --> 15:21.485
Look, we both want
the same thing here.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.688
- Don't. Don't try
to make us the same.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.756
I work with these kids
every day.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.758
I do anything
for any one of these kids.

15:27.894 --> 15:28.892
- Oh yeah?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.829
'cause if you were really
looking out for these kids,

15:31.898 --> 15:34.365
You wouldn't be hanging out with
keegan if you knew what he did!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.633
- I do know! He told me!

15:38.505 --> 15:40.972
After you came back around,
he knew it'd only be a matter
of time before I found out.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.575
- Okay.
- Keegan's out of the picture.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.444
And yeah, he made
a terrible mistake.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.614
But at least
he never stopped showing up.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.854
- After keegan and I fell out,

15:56.890 --> 16:01.091
I started avoiding everything
that we did together.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.795
Poker night, food truck...

16:06.433 --> 16:07.732
Even our work here.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.667
And that was wrong,
crystal, I know that.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.536
(sighing)

16:15.075 --> 16:16.173
Crystal.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.576
I am sorry.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.548
(sighing)

16:25.418 --> 16:27.485
You know, I miss this place.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.022
(sniffing)
richie, dane, the others,

16:31.024 --> 16:33.224
I mean, they used
to practically live in there.

16:33.226 --> 16:37.228
- Yeah. The city shut it down
about a month after you left.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.366
The kids were so crushed
when we had to cancel
the basketball program.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.101
(sighing)

16:45.905 --> 16:47.104
It's too bad.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.376
It was a good team.
- Mmm.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.719
Mad skills, mad skills.
- Oh, my god...

17:01.854 --> 17:04.188
- We got mad skills...

17:04.190 --> 17:08.125
♪ we stay undefeated
because we do our drills ♪

17:08.161 --> 17:11.996
♪ if you try to play us
you better have a will ♪

17:11.998 --> 17:16.400
♪ mad skills, mad skills
we got mad skills ♪

17:19.339 --> 17:20.404
(chuckling)

17:20.440 --> 17:22.106
(distant siren blaring)

17:22.108 --> 17:23.207
- Look...

17:24.477 --> 17:26.610
I made a few calls
about this place.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.080
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.684
<i> (sam): Testing, testing.</i>
<i> Red leather, yellow leather.</i>
<i> Red leather, yellow leather.</i>

17:33.686 --> 17:35.420
(nathan): Coming in
loud and clear.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.055
<i> (sam): Okay, remember, just be</i>
<i>yourself, lean into what's real.</i>

17:38.124 --> 17:40.825
<i>(nathan): Three years of improv</i>
<i>I took in the city. I got this.</i>

17:49.536 --> 17:51.169
Eyes on the target.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.769
(indistinct chatter)

17:52.806 --> 17:54.772
(clearing throat)
hello!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.675
(indistinct chatter)

17:57.744 --> 18:00.678
- Okay, nathan, show me
what you got. Move in.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.547
- You must be will french.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.750
Seen your face
on a few bus stops lately.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.453
- I know, it's horrifying.
I hate myself, but...

18:09.588 --> 18:11.622
(both): Business is business.
- Hey!

18:11.757 --> 18:13.357
Everybody's gotta
have a gimmick, right?

18:13.359 --> 18:14.558
(chuckling)
- absolutely.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.193
You know what mine is?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.262
<i> Total discretion.</i>

18:18.397 --> 18:19.730
- That's a great suit.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.099
- Plastic surgeon,
comes with the territory.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.602
I could have given you
a nose job yesterday.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.936
Never let on.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.171
(chuckling)

18:27.173 --> 18:28.739
- That is good to know.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.542
But... What about genioplasty?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.945
Not saying I'm thinking
about it,

18:34.080 --> 18:36.547
Except maybe
I'm thinking about it.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.149
(laughing nervously)
- yes, and...

18:41.187 --> 18:43.354
- Okay, that's a signal.
Our boy needs backup.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.123
- Okay, just wait, no...
I need to focus. Genioplasty.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.359
<i> Hang in there, dr. Griffon.</i>

18:48.428 --> 18:50.828
- Pretty sure I don't need
my knees done.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.431
- Okay, but my approach
is holistic.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.900
- Chin implants!

18:55.969 --> 18:57.969
Chin, chin, chin implants!

18:58.104 --> 19:00.671
It's a chin implant used
to achieve facial harmony!

19:00.707 --> 19:02.039
What the hell is facial harmony?

19:02.174 --> 19:04.308
- Listen, I'd love
to take your money,

19:04.443 --> 19:07.311
But I have to say,
your chin is pretty solid.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.479
(chuckling)

19:08.614 --> 19:10.715
- If you came here
looking for a deal...

19:11.985 --> 19:14.285
(camera clicking)
<i> ...You just might find one.</i>

19:14.287 --> 19:16.420
- Is that a birthmark?
<i> (will): What's your name?</i>

19:16.422 --> 19:18.923
<i> (nathan): Charlie griffon.</i>
- Charlie griffon.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.259
I just might call you doc.
- Suits me fine.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.928
- Let me show you the house.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.762
(suspenseful music)

19:28.902 --> 19:32.003
- Let's go, dr. Griffon!

19:32.138 --> 19:34.771
That's my boy
right there. Sorry.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.420
- Thank you so much,
ms. Briggs, for coming.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.988
- Detective duff...

19:51.991 --> 19:53.758
It's nice to put a face
to the voice,

19:53.760 --> 19:56.627
And a rather persuasive
voice at that.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.696
- I would like for you
to meet crystal smith,

19:58.831 --> 20:00.597
Former director of programming
and community services

20:00.633 --> 20:01.866
Here at the centre.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.200
- It's nice to meet you,
ms. Smith.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.036
- I'm glad you made the time,
deputy mayor.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.505
- Well, detective duff here
was very convincing.

20:09.909 --> 20:14.312
So... This is the place that's
going to save my reputation?

20:15.248 --> 20:17.848
- Yeah, this is it.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.452
- It's not exactly
as I imagined, but...

20:21.521 --> 20:23.921
I'm here now,
so let's hear the pitch.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.923
- Do you know where you're
standing, deputy mayor?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.692
It's marshall court.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.593
One of the city's most
publicized neighbourhoods

20:29.629 --> 20:33.130
When it comes to gun violence...
And drug abuse.

20:33.166 --> 20:36.667
- But there is so much more
to this community.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.737
With over 50 ethnicities
reported on our local census,

20:39.806 --> 20:42.006
It's one of the most diverse
communities

20:42.141 --> 20:44.675
And voter demographics
in the city.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.410
We look out for each other,

20:46.545 --> 20:50.014
And we take notice when people
look out for us too.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.650
- A little help from city hall
could go a long way.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.154
It'll help shift the focus
of the press in your favour

20:57.290 --> 20:58.555
Since lorraine's arrest.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.759
Your daughter may have been
a part of the problem,

21:01.761 --> 21:04.628
But you could be
part of the solution.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.896
- Fine.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.998
Show me.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.334
- Right this way.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.172
<i> (nathan): It's a great house.</i>
<i> (will): Mm-hmm.</i>

21:15.308 --> 21:17.775
- I'm just not sold
on the neighbourhood.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.443
It's pretty dull.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.178
Do you have any listings
anywhere else?

21:21.214 --> 21:23.648
<i> (will): Forrest hill, uh...</i>

21:23.783 --> 21:27.184
<i> Lawrence park north,</i>
<i> bridal path.</i>

21:27.220 --> 21:29.853
<i>I've got an all-glass place out</i>
<i> on the bluffs. I mean, you...</i>

21:29.889 --> 21:31.322
- This guy's got places
all over the city.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.724
- Yeah, tell me about it.
He even has a place up north.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.194
You know what?
Will has mentioned every place
in the gta except for one.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.263
Nathan, ask him
about port credit.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.365
- And bridal path, I mean,

21:41.401 --> 21:42.833
You're living on
the same street with drake.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.668
- What about port credit?

21:44.704 --> 21:46.337
Further west.
Anything over there?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.639
- Easy, dr. Griffon...

21:48.774 --> 21:50.941
- Come on, come on, come on,
nathan, lean into what's real.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.242
- Why port credit?

21:52.278 --> 21:54.678
- It's... Just my dad.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.748
He's 64.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.217
Still works over at the ford
plant near burlington.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.355
Used to drive me through
that area...

22:04.490 --> 22:06.824
After work, as a kid.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.626
We'd pick out
our favourite houses,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.561
Talk about med school.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.165
Dream big, you know.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.333
<i> I guess I've always</i>
<i> wanted something</i>

22:16.468 --> 22:17.568
<i> In that area ever since.</i>

22:19.272 --> 22:20.771
- I know you.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.909
You're a dreamer.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.778
And I know that feeling.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.916
That's a $215 pocket square.
These are $1,800 shoes.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.919
And if you saw
where I grew up...

22:35.988 --> 22:38.054
(scoffing)

22:38.091 --> 22:43.093
<i> Look, I haven't moved my</i>
<i> business that far west yet.</i>

22:43.096 --> 22:45.396
But if I come across something,

22:45.531 --> 22:47.531
I'm gonna holler at you, doc.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.667
Do I got your number?

22:49.802 --> 22:51.535
- You can certainly have it.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.537
<i> - Alright, let me grab</i>
<i> you a card. Alright?</i>

22:53.539 --> 22:55.338
<i> (nathan): Thank you.</i>

22:55.375 --> 22:56.874
(mumbling)

22:57.009 --> 22:59.543
- This just doesn't make sense.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.946
This title list from
the land registry is up to date.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.347
I mean, it says right here,

23:03.349 --> 23:06.016
He owns 2621 stadner street,
in port credit.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.219
- Yeah, it's not listed
on his site either.

23:08.354 --> 23:12.022
- So, what's will hiding
in port credit?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.499
Deputy mayor, but--
- it's perfect.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.234
I'll support the funding.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.702
I'll run it through
my emergency fund

23:25.704 --> 23:28.272
And I'll have workers here
as early as next month.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.640
- Thank you, ms. Briggs.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.175
- I'll have my publicist, patty

23:31.244 --> 23:33.177
Give you a call to set up
a photo-op.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.213
Monday, okay?
You can round up a few kids.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.649
- Actually, one last thing.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.984
We want to rename the centre.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.053
It's named after
a former slave owner,

23:43.122 --> 23:44.921
And the city turned down
our last petition. So--

23:44.957 --> 23:47.591
- I think that's
a fantastic idea.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.660
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.328
- Okay!
(chuckling)

23:51.364 --> 23:52.463
We were thinking

23:52.465 --> 23:53.997
The donald moore
recreation centre.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.501
Or chantal dunn...
- Yeah.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.003
- Maybe jean augustine?

24:00.072 --> 24:03.206
- The briggs legacy centre
has a really nice ring to it,

24:03.242 --> 24:04.575
Don't you think?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.744
Float it by your people,
see how it fares.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.446
- Thank you.
- Detective, pleasure.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.681
Ms. Smith, I'll be in touch.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.751
- Sure will.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.819
Thank you so much.
- Hmm!

24:18.391 --> 24:20.491
- The briggs legacy centre?

24:20.493 --> 24:23.827
- That's better than
no community centre. Okay?

24:23.863 --> 24:25.295
(car starting)

24:25.331 --> 24:27.898
- Point taken.
(laughing)

24:30.236 --> 24:32.236
(laughing)
- yeah, okay, listen.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.770
You were good, okay?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.372
Dr. Griffon, great.

24:35.374 --> 24:38.909
But I mean,
he's no scarborough stu, fam!

24:38.911 --> 24:41.245
I'll bet you a roti
and a patty.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.914
(laughing)
how about that? Yeah!

24:44.049 --> 24:46.650
Anyway, I should go.
Okay, peace.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.720
Nathan's got eyes on will still.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.189
- At least someone's
got eyes on something,

24:52.258 --> 24:53.457
'cause this property is vacant.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.527
<i>Nada, nista, nic, niets, nimic.</i>

24:56.596 --> 24:58.929
<i> Intet...</i> That's hungarian.
No, is that swedish?

24:58.965 --> 25:00.764
I don't know.<i> Rien.</i> That's--
- french.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.600
- Yes. Great.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

25:02.735 --> 25:03.934
(chuckling)

25:04.069 --> 25:06.136
Well, listen, good news
is that if it is vacant,

25:06.272 --> 25:08.605
We can get in there to check it
out without a warrant.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.141
- Better news is surrogates
sometimes buy houses

25:11.143 --> 25:12.476
For underground criminals
to hide out in.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.812
So, if will
is a coyote surrogate

25:14.814 --> 25:16.212
And he's lying about
owning a house...

25:16.249 --> 25:17.815
- This could be
a coyote hideout.

25:17.817 --> 25:18.982
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.451
- Hey, I got you something.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.093
No oatmeal, no raisins.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.031
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:36.435 --> 25:37.835
- Um...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.503
Could I ask you a question?

25:39.572 --> 25:41.305
I just like, noticed that
you and nathan like,

25:41.374 --> 25:43.040
Have gotten close
these past few months.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.775
I'm just wondering,
it's no big deal, but like,

25:44.910 --> 25:48.245
Do you guys ever,
just a thought, go from...

25:48.314 --> 25:49.980
Like, bromance to no-mance?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.416
- Wow, uh...

25:52.418 --> 25:54.718
You know,
come to think of it...

25:54.754 --> 25:55.986
No.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.254
- No. Of course.
- Doesn't happen.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.658
- Yeah. What's the...

26:03.496 --> 26:05.262
Like, if you had a secret,
what would...

26:05.397 --> 26:06.997
What would that be like
to your bro-bond?

26:07.033 --> 26:08.399
What do you guys...

26:08.534 --> 26:10.401
Is it like,
do you go to a hot tub?

26:10.536 --> 26:13.003
'cause they're nice.
Or hot yoga, that's a good thing

26:13.005 --> 26:14.471
To do together.
Could probably do that.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.340
Or maybe hot tub yoga,
'cause that's a really

26:16.475 --> 26:17.608
Wonderful thing to try.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.976
- What is it?
That's not a thing.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.678
- It's a real thing.
- I don't think so.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.446
- It's a really excellent thing.
(chuckling)

26:22.515 --> 26:24.347
- No, listen...
(sighing)

26:24.383 --> 26:27.284
Truth is, we show up at work,

26:27.353 --> 26:30.487
We have each other's back,
and we get the job done.

26:30.523 --> 26:31.889
- Yeah, of course,
you keep it "profesh".

26:32.024 --> 26:34.758
Like, no axe throwing...
No sleepovers.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.027
Why would we ever do that?
So that's... That's great.

26:37.162 --> 26:38.162
- Right.
- Good.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.597
- Is this really about
me and nathan?

26:41.967 --> 26:43.100
- Oh.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.735
(rhythmic music)

26:44.804 --> 26:46.169
Oh, my god.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.372
- What's he doing?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.041
Is he fumigating?

26:51.043 --> 26:53.110
- I don't know, but we gotta
get in that house.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.578
- I mean, is it safe?
(garage door opening)

26:55.615 --> 26:57.614
- I've got just the thing.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.583
(car window whirring)

27:02.254 --> 27:04.455
- I wasn't even out there
when that cop got shot.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.056
(door buzzing in the distance)

27:06.058 --> 27:08.659
- I still need
more than that, richie.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.260
(sighing)

27:10.329 --> 27:12.329
Look, even if you don't
trust me after today,

27:12.331 --> 27:14.364
You trust crystal, right?

27:15.534 --> 27:18.835
So where were you?
- I was at the community centre.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.205
- With who?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.141
- By myself.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.543
- Really?

27:27.413 --> 27:29.479
- Okay, believe what you want.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.281
It doesn't matter.
I can't prove it.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.683
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I believe you.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.518
I believe you. Okay?

27:36.422 --> 27:37.554
(sighing)

27:37.556 --> 27:39.356
What were you doing
there by yourself?

27:40.693 --> 27:43.360
- I was shooting around.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.831
- Poor choice of words.
(scoffing)

27:47.833 --> 27:49.500
Just saying.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.769
You still trash
at horse, though?

27:53.406 --> 27:54.905
- Okay.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.975
Okay, trash is an overstatement.
I'm better than you.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.311
(scoffing)
- I still got mad skills

28:01.313 --> 28:04.047
Even at my age. Okay?
- Right, right.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.917
I was gonna...

28:06.986 --> 28:09.987
Try out for the ball team
when I got to college.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.923
(chuckling)

28:12.992 --> 28:15.259
I guess it's not happening now.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.593
(crying)

28:16.662 --> 28:19.663
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.398
We're getting you
out of here, okay?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.399
We're gonna get you cleared.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.002
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.004
- Okay.
- Um...

28:27.006 --> 28:28.404
I was at the community
centre today.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.340
I thought only crystal
had keys to get in?

28:30.476 --> 28:33.210
So how did you?
- My grandfather

28:33.345 --> 28:35.546
Used to be the custodian.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.147
I still have his keys.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.650
- Did you ask him for the keys
the night of the shooting?

28:39.652 --> 28:41.351
Maybe... He's your alibi.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.554
- No. You think I haven't
thought of that?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.090
He left his keys behind

28:47.159 --> 28:49.026
When he moved to a nursing home.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.960
(sighing)

28:51.831 --> 28:53.429
So...

28:55.167 --> 28:56.834
What now?

28:58.303 --> 28:59.770
(sighing)

28:59.839 --> 29:01.504
(birdsong)

29:02.842 --> 29:04.841
- Are we gonna talk about
the fact that you just

29:04.977 --> 29:07.177
Had these on hand?
- No thank you.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.182
(knocking on door)

29:14.487 --> 29:16.319
(knocking on door)

29:18.657 --> 29:21.658
Gtpd! We're coming in!

29:22.728 --> 29:25.062
(rhythmic music)

29:32.338 --> 29:33.870
Upstairs is clear.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.638
- Yeah, down here too.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.210
- What's back there?
- Ah, it's just an empty pantry.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.483
- Yeah, it's a pantry,
but with another door inside.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.520
- I know. I checked it already.
It's locked.

29:49.655 --> 29:50.954
I figured it connects
to the garage.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.388
I was gonna check
on our way out.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.226
- I don't... I don't think
it's locked,

29:56.361 --> 29:58.094
I think it's just stuck.
You know what I'm gonna do?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.830
I'm gonna start back here, yeah.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.098
I'll give myself like
a running start, like that.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.967
Then, I'm gonna come at it,
I'm gonna be like "bam"

30:04.102 --> 30:05.502
And I'm gonna kick it like...

30:05.637 --> 30:07.403
Ya!

30:09.375 --> 30:10.607
What?

30:10.742 --> 30:12.442
- You're just really cute.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.845
- It's funny, I have never
been more attracted to you.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.145
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.581
- Is it the whole
full-body condom suit

30:17.583 --> 30:18.982
That's doing it for you?
- It definitely is.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.650
Protection's like, super hot.
- It is, right?

30:20.686 --> 30:22.052
- Ah!
- Sam!

30:22.121 --> 30:23.053
(thudding)

30:28.527 --> 30:30.460
(softly): I'm okay. Oh, god.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.463
- Jeez.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.732
Come on.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.533
(grunting)

30:40.806 --> 30:44.540
Ah. I guess it wasn't
just an empty pantry.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.343
I know a lot of this stuff.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.145
That's a separatory funnel,

30:48.147 --> 30:49.613
That's a rovotap vacuum,

30:49.615 --> 30:51.648
These are tlc plates.
I can keep going.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.485
Okay. Acetone.
This, ladies and gentlemen,

30:55.487 --> 30:58.755
And our non-binary friends,
was indeed a drug lab.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.423
- Was?

31:00.492 --> 31:01.892
- Well, yeah. I mean,

31:02.027 --> 31:03.694
The tools are all here.
But there's no drugs.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.762
And the acetone was probably
used to clean it all up.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.832
Find anything?
- Uh, I don't know,

31:08.967 --> 31:12.236
Just like, a bunch of really
ugly lady suitcases

31:12.371 --> 31:14.638
Obviously designed
by men, but...

31:14.640 --> 31:16.773
I don't know, do you think...

31:16.775 --> 31:18.575
They were used
to transport drugs?

31:18.644 --> 31:20.176
- It's possible.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.845
- Maybe the lab can tell us.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.246
- Yeah, we should call
this in with nathan.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.515
Come on. Let's get
the hell out of here.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.016
- Yeah.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.687
(soft music)

31:32.991 --> 31:34.758
- Okay.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.593
So, you haven't been back
in marshall court

31:36.662 --> 31:38.094
In the past six months?

31:40.833 --> 31:43.466
Alright, thank you
for your time, mr. Clarke.

31:43.502 --> 31:48.037
Yes, I'm doing everything
I can to help your grandson.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.074
Mm-hmm. Okay.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.342
Take care.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.211
Oh, my gosh.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.950
(chuckling)

31:59.952 --> 32:03.353
So, your mom finally
drive you out your own house?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.622
- Almost. But this
doesn't belong to me.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.257
- Whose is it then?

32:07.392 --> 32:09.826
- Uh, possibly the coyotes.

32:23.909 --> 32:26.910
- Who's that guy?
- Uh, this is will french,

32:27.045 --> 32:29.112
Park-bench real estate mogul.
He owns an empty house

32:29.247 --> 32:30.914
In port credit
where we found the remnants

32:30.916 --> 32:32.716
Of a possible coyote drug lab.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.184
- Okay, so did you bring him in?

32:34.186 --> 32:36.185
Maybe he knows something
about gabrielle's shooting?

32:36.221 --> 32:38.255
- Well, the property was vacant
and the drugs were gone.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.057
So he has plausible deniability.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.391
So...

32:41.526 --> 32:44.327
- So you have nothing.
- Except for that.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.862
Hoping the lab will be able
to tell us

32:45.864 --> 32:47.464
If there were drugs inside.

32:53.038 --> 32:54.371
What's that?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.905
(sniffing)

32:57.209 --> 32:58.675
- Could be nothing.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.278
But you should get your guys
at the lab to test it

33:01.413 --> 33:03.013
While you're down there.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.048
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.752
- So, um, what happened
with richie clarke?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.754
- You know, I realized...

33:10.823 --> 33:14.057
He never disclosed his alibi,
so I went to go see him.

33:14.059 --> 33:16.059
Says he was playing basketball

33:16.194 --> 33:17.694
At that run-down
community centre.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.497
But... He was alone, so...

33:20.566 --> 33:22.231
- No street cams?
- No, I checked.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.235
I checked everything.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.004
- You know what, "sometimes,
two nothings make a something."

33:29.307 --> 33:30.907
- That sounds like a meme.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.909
- No. It's third-year
criminology class,

33:32.911 --> 33:34.578
Professor graham, he looked
a lot like tom selleck,

33:34.713 --> 33:36.579
So I paid close attention.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.449
- What?

33:39.451 --> 33:40.917
- Let's go do what we do.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.052
- Go where?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.587
- Marshall court.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.921
In the meantime,
I'm gonna get naz

33:44.990 --> 33:46.656
To drop this down at the lab.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.591
Let's go!

33:48.660 --> 33:50.660
(door opening)

33:50.662 --> 33:52.395
(sighing)

33:54.066 --> 33:56.733
Ah, no, the gym lights
aren't working either.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.668
(door closing)

33:58.737 --> 34:02.338
- Are you really practising
your jump shot right now?

34:03.475 --> 34:06.409
Read the room, wazowski.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.347
- Technically, that doesn't
make sense,

34:10.482 --> 34:11.748
Given there's only
two people in the room.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.349
- Well, technically,
your form is ridiculous.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.620
We don't have time
for this right now.

34:16.622 --> 34:17.821
- Take a shot. Trust me.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.290
- Alright.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.427
(inhaling)
you know...

34:24.463 --> 34:28.098
I haven't missed a free throw
in this gym since 2018.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.632
Pop!

34:29.668 --> 34:31.034
- Oh.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.903
- That doesn't count.
It was too dark in here.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.005
- Exactly. There's no light.

34:35.007 --> 34:36.907
And richie says
he was here at night.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.575
- So, richie was lying, or...

34:38.644 --> 34:40.177
- There's still electricity
in this place.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.911
- Mm-hmm.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.047
(rhythmic music)

34:45.384 --> 34:47.984
(keys rattling)
it's gotta be one of these.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.986
(groaning)
- the smaller one.

34:50.055 --> 34:52.589
It's the smaller one.
It's the smaller one.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.024
- Fine. I'm gonna use this one.

34:55.060 --> 34:58.328
I think this might be...<i> Voilà!</i>

34:58.330 --> 34:59.796
- Right. It's the small one.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.331
(sighing)

35:02.334 --> 35:04.033
- And...
(sighing)

35:05.003 --> 35:07.003
On the first day...

35:07.873 --> 35:08.938
- Oh, yes!

35:08.974 --> 35:10.907
- ...There was light. Yes!

35:11.042 --> 35:12.676
- Yeah, it's on out here too.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.811
- Alright, let's go to the gym.
Maybe there's something there.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.746
- Or maybe there's
something right here.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.548
If richie had to turn
the breakers on

35:18.617 --> 35:19.950
To use the gym...

35:20.085 --> 35:22.752
- He probably switched
the security system on too.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.855
- Yeah.
- Alright, let's go.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.826
(rhythmic music)

35:34.066 --> 35:36.232
- Do not open it.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.645
(car starting)

35:51.116 --> 35:52.782
(tires screeching)

35:57.022 --> 35:59.322
(sirens blaring in the distance)

36:04.763 --> 36:07.330
- Shanika.
You got something for me?

36:07.465 --> 36:11.201
- Hey, tobin, look.
This is exactly how I got it.

36:11.203 --> 36:13.769
I didn't open it and I didn't
take anything, I swear.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.748
- Good job.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.554
Be in touch soon.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.758
(van starting)

36:52.677 --> 36:54.311
- So what time was the shooting?

36:54.446 --> 36:57.047
- Um, at 10:05 pm.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.650
- You really think
he spent three hours

37:00.652 --> 37:01.917
In the gym by himself?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.753
- I don't know.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.955
He was planning on trying out
for a college team.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.358
Oh... Oh-ho.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.728
He did get better.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.063
(chuckling)

37:13.065 --> 37:14.731
Oh, wow.
- Duff.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.066
- Come on, come on, come on...

37:16.068 --> 37:17.801
- Just a few more minutes.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.336
- 10:05!
(grunting)

37:23.541 --> 37:25.675
- He's innocent!
- He's innocent!

37:25.711 --> 37:28.611
- Yes! Yeah!
- Ahh!

37:28.680 --> 37:29.945
- Yeah!

37:29.982 --> 37:31.748
(celebratory chants)

37:31.750 --> 37:33.617
- What, what, what, what?
- Go, go, go!

37:33.752 --> 37:35.117
- Hello.
(smacking)

37:35.153 --> 37:36.519
- Oh.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.653
- We got something.
- Yep.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.089
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.957
- Yep...
- We're gonna...

37:41.092 --> 37:43.026
- So this little piece
of pink rubber that you found,

37:43.161 --> 37:45.362
Lab results came back.
- Let me guess...

37:45.497 --> 37:47.130
Cocaine?
- How d'you know?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.465
- Ah, I've seen
this stuff before.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.567
They turn the coke solid
so it's hard to spot

37:51.637 --> 37:53.969
And easy to smuggle in.
I mean, it's been disguised

37:54.006 --> 37:56.506
As printer toner,
metal mouldings...

37:56.508 --> 37:58.641
- Suitcase lining.
It's suitcase lining.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.043
- Exactly.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.145
And that equipment that we found
in that basement lab

38:02.280 --> 38:04.447
Is what hazmat,
presumably the coyote chemist,

38:04.483 --> 38:06.382
Was using to turn it back
into its powdered form.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.118
- Same cocaine as anthony,
same cocaine as the bikers.

38:09.154 --> 38:11.721
Adam, marc, niccolo,
bingo ramirez,

38:11.757 --> 38:13.523
They're all working as part
of the same network.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.860
All signing their texts
with that same coyote emoji.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.262
All moving that same
pink cartel cocaine.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.464
- Yeah, sounds right.
This is huge.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.333
(chuckling)
- well, partially right.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.402
I had my friends in fraud
spend the day going through

38:25.404 --> 38:27.003
Will french's finances.

38:28.206 --> 38:29.872
All his home purchases
are with clean money,

38:29.908 --> 38:32.475
Renovations too.
He is not a coyote surrogate.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.410
- So, they're using
this guy's properties

38:34.446 --> 38:36.813
As a pink coke lab
for the pandilla quince?

38:36.948 --> 38:38.414
- Exactly. It doesn't
make any sense.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.884
Why risk all that clean money
to align with these guys?

38:41.019 --> 38:43.153
- So we have to keep tabs
on will french.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.588
He may not be our surrogate,
but he is definitely our way in.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.859
(rhythmic music)

38:49.895 --> 38:51.428
(indistinct chattering)

38:51.563 --> 38:53.529
(kelly clearing throat)

38:58.503 --> 39:00.370
(inhaling)

39:00.372 --> 39:02.171
- Richie clark is getting out.

39:02.207 --> 39:03.773
(chuckling)
- ah-ha.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.041
(len clearing throat)

39:07.646 --> 39:08.978
- What?

39:09.047 --> 39:11.047
- I thought you wanted us
to keep our distance.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.916
(sighing)
- I have ceased to care

39:12.918 --> 39:15.318
About that. Look, I'm happy...
- Mm-hmm.

39:15.453 --> 39:19.456
- ...You're happy,
so let's just try being happy.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.125
I'm a grown-ass woman,
I don't need to sneak around.

39:26.298 --> 39:27.797
- Good.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.599
I'll see you
at your place later?

39:30.735 --> 39:32.535
(kelly): Sounds good.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.338
Sounds real good.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.672
- Okay.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.476
Alright.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.321
(sighing)

39:53.558 --> 39:54.757
- Hey, duff.
- Ready?

39:54.793 --> 39:57.226
- Yeah, uh... Duff, I...

39:57.262 --> 39:59.962
I've been thinking and I...
I just wanted to say...

39:59.998 --> 40:02.899
- Okay, sam.
Please, I already told you,

40:02.968 --> 40:04.634
I don't wanna talk about
what happened with us.

40:04.703 --> 40:05.868
- Neither do I.

40:09.374 --> 40:12.442
Listen, I've been
thinking and...

40:14.713 --> 40:17.279
I try so hard to be your friend.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.716
Really hard.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.184
And I really just keep
messing up the one thing

40:22.220 --> 40:23.853
That we do well together.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.522
Work.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.993
(inhaling)

40:30.128 --> 40:33.429
- So... What?

40:34.533 --> 40:36.832
- I was thinking maybe
we just keep it profesh.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.870
What do you think?

40:40.872 --> 40:44.207
- I think, uh, the word...

40:44.209 --> 40:47.143
"profesh" is the very
antithesis of professionalism.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.878
(chuckling)

40:51.216 --> 40:53.016
But I think maybe you're right.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.352
- Okay.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.820
I'm ready.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.489
- Okay.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.691
And we are ready.
(car starting)

41:09.968 --> 41:12.168
(soft music)

41:18.844 --> 41:21.176
- So? What's the word?

41:21.213 --> 41:23.980
- Richie will be
fully exonerated.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.049
Now, it'll take a few days,
but it's a sure thing.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.817
(laughing)

41:31.056 --> 41:33.256
(sighing)
uh-huh.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.857
- Thank you.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.659
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
call his grandfather.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.894
- Of course.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.363
Hey, how's that
for building a bridge?

41:40.432 --> 41:43.666
- A tenuous bridge,
but a bridge nonetheless.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.703
- Yo, detective duff.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.071
Can I talk to you right quick?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.207
Off the books?

41:55.981 --> 41:57.413
If I share something with you,

41:57.482 --> 42:00.215
This better not be
another richie situation.

42:00.252 --> 42:02.218
- I get it. Understood.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.420
- I wasn't completely
honest with you earlier.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.590
- About what?
- That night that cop got shot.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.393
Some guy paid me $200
to set off some fireworks

42:10.395 --> 42:12.161
By that shottipper thingy.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.830
- Wait, wait.
You have a friend in jail.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.899
You have information that could
help, you don't come forward?

42:16.034 --> 42:18.768
- In this neighbourhood, we know
better than to trust cops.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.038
Richie knew the risk he was
taking talking to you guys.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.506
He gets that.

42:23.641 --> 42:26.175
But what you did
for marshall court today,

42:26.177 --> 42:28.044
Richie and the community centre?

42:29.514 --> 42:30.980
You're alright.

42:32.284 --> 42:34.450
- The guy who paid you off.
You see what he looked like?

42:34.586 --> 42:36.052
- Nah. It was dark.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.920
This guy had to be white.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.789
He had this massive
red hickey on his neck.

42:39.924 --> 42:41.991
Like, the thing was huge, fam.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.694
- Thanks, appreciate it. Okay.

42:44.829 --> 42:46.662
- Hey, hey.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

42:51.670 --> 42:55.104
- The guy you saw
looked like him?

42:55.140 --> 42:57.340
- Yeah, that's the hickey,
still.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.642
- Hmm...
- Y'all know where to find me.

43:01.212 --> 43:04.079
- Duff. Do you
know what this means?

43:04.115 --> 43:06.082
- Will french probably
lured us here.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.783
- Will french could be
gabrielle's shooter.

43:07.852 --> 43:08.951
- Yes.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.692
Subtitling: Difuze
