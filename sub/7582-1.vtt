01:35.245 --> 01:37.163
Time to get up, man.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.293
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

02:49.152 --> 02:50.987
Should be here soon.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.662
- I think I should make a list.
- What do you mean?

03:40.870 --> 03:43.248
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

03:43.456 --> 03:46.001
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

03:46.209 --> 03:50.255
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

03:50.463 --> 03:53.383
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

03:53.883 --> 03:55.802
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

03:56.052 --> 03:59.598
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.438
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

04:13.737 --> 04:16.656
Can we go to the park today, after?

04:17.490 --> 04:20.911
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.704
Give me a kiss.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.457
I'll talk to you later.

04:28.919 --> 04:30.545
Excuse me.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.048
Oh, excuse me...

04:33.256 --> 04:35.550
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

04:38.595 --> 04:41.097
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.726
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.897
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

04:49.356 --> 04:52.400
<i>I met my father for the first time</i>
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

04:53.193 --> 04:54.861
<i>And I made up my mind</i>
<i>as a young kid...</i>

04:55.111 --> 04:56.571
<i>... that when I had children...</i>

04:56.780 --> 05:00.116
<i>... my children were gonna know</i>
<i>who their father was.</i>

05:01.993 --> 05:04.746
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

05:05.580 --> 05:08.917
<i>This part is called "Riding the Bus."</i>

05:15.465 --> 05:17.092
What's that?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.928
It's a time machine, isn't it?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.305
Seems like a time machine.

05:22.555 --> 05:25.600
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.018
<i>This machine...</i>

05:27.477 --> 05:28.728
<i>... this machine on my lap...</i>

05:28.979 --> 05:30.897
This guy, he has a time machine.

05:31.147 --> 05:34.150
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

05:34.401 --> 05:36.611
- <i>it is not a time machine.</i>

05:37.153 --> 05:39.781
<i>It's a portable</i>
<i>bone-density scanner.</i>

05:40.657 --> 05:43.243
<i>A medical device I sell for a living.</i>

05:43.493 --> 05:45.954
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.248
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

05:48.498 --> 05:50.208
It's unnecessary and expensive.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.544
- Well, maybe next...
- Thank you.

05:53.670 --> 05:58.717
<i>It gave a slightly denser picture</i>
<i>than an x-ray for twice the money.</i>

06:01.761 --> 06:03.305
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

06:03.513 --> 06:05.181
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.975
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

06:07.517 --> 06:09.686
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.646
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.983
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

06:15.191 --> 06:17.819
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

06:18.028 --> 06:20.155
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

06:20.363 --> 06:23.867
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

06:28.204 --> 06:32.375
<i>You see that car? The one</i>
<i>with the pretty yellow shoe on it?</i>

06:32.626 --> 06:33.960
<i>That's mine.</i>

06:34.210 --> 06:36.129
<i>There's no parking near hospitals.</i>

06:36.379 --> 06:38.840
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you're always in a rush.</i>

06:39.049 --> 06:40.926
Thanks anyway. Very much.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.054
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

06:44.971 --> 06:50.477
<i>I needed to sell at least two scanners</i>
<i>a month for rent and daycare.</i>

06:51.394 --> 06:52.687
<i>I'd have to sell one more...</i>

06:52.896 --> 06:56.691
<i>... to pay off all of those tickets</i>
<i>under my windshield wiper.</i>

07:03.490 --> 07:05.492
<i>The problem is...</i>

07:06.409 --> 07:08.870
<i>... I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

07:10.580 --> 07:13.250
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.002
Since birth?

07:18.505 --> 07:20.507
- What's that?
- What?

07:20.757 --> 07:23.802
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.513
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

07:26.763 --> 07:29.808
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.018
What are you supposed
to do with it?

07:32.769 --> 07:35.814
Make every side the same colour.

07:37.107 --> 07:39.401
Did you pay the taxes?

07:39.693 --> 07:42.821
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

07:43.613 --> 07:47.742
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

07:48.118 --> 07:51.830
That's... It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.165
That means interest, right?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.751
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

07:56.960 --> 08:02.591
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

08:02.799 --> 08:06.928
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

08:14.978 --> 08:18.607
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

08:19.316 --> 08:22.235
<i>A few days ago I was presented</i>
<i>with a report I'd asked for...</i>

08:22.485 --> 08:26.156
<i>... a comprehensive audit, if you will,</i>
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

08:26.823 --> 08:29.576
<i>You won't like it. I didn't like it.</i>

08:29.826 --> 08:31.453
<i>But we have to face the truth...</i>

08:31.661 --> 08:34.289
<i>... and then go to work</i>
<i>to turn things around.</i>

08:34.496 --> 08:38.251
<i>And make no mistake about it,</i>
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

08:38.501 --> 08:41.546
<i>The federal budget is out of control.</i>

08:41.755 --> 08:45.133
<i>And we face runaway deficits</i>
<i>of almost $80 billion...</i>

08:45.342 --> 08:48.762
<i>... for this budget year</i>
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

08:49.012 --> 08:54.184
<i>That deficit is larger than</i>
<i>the entire federal budget in 1957.</i>

08:54.434 --> 08:56.978
<i>And so is the almost $80 billion...</i>

08:57.187 --> 09:01.483
<i>... we will pay in interest</i>
<i>this year on the national debt.</i>

09:02.108 --> 09:04.653
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960...</i>

09:04.861 --> 09:08.990
<i>... our federal government payroll</i>
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

09:09.199 --> 09:11.910
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

09:12.118 --> 09:17.666
<i>During these 20 years, our population</i>
<i>has only increased by 23.3 percent...</i>

09:35.892 --> 09:38.603
Man, I got two questions for you:

09:38.853 --> 09:41.940
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

09:43.441 --> 09:46.528
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

09:46.736 --> 09:48.697
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

09:48.989 --> 09:52.701
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

09:52.909 --> 09:55.287
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

09:55.537 --> 09:57.539
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

09:57.747 --> 10:00.208
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

10:07.424 --> 10:09.801
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

10:14.097 --> 10:18.727
<i>They all looked</i>
<i>so damn happy to me.</i>

10:25.942 --> 10:28.320
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

10:45.962 --> 10:47.255
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

10:47.464 --> 10:50.592
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.095
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

10:54.304 --> 10:56.932
Yeah? What job?

10:57.474 --> 10:59.434
You know, when I...

10:59.643 --> 11:02.270
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

11:02.479 --> 11:05.815
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

11:06.983 --> 11:08.860
What job?

11:11.821 --> 11:13.573
Stockbroker.

11:15.909 --> 11:19.079
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

11:19.537 --> 11:21.456
Not an astronaut?

11:38.515 --> 11:39.975
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.896
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.815
You should probably
do your sales calls.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.693
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.113
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

11:53.697 --> 11:56.074
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.159
Probably not.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.829
We're already two months behind.

12:01.037 --> 12:04.082
Next week we'll owe three months.

12:04.541 --> 12:08.670
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

12:09.129 --> 12:13.383
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

12:13.633 --> 12:17.304
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.724
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

12:20.974 --> 12:22.309
...for you and for Christopher.

12:23.727 --> 12:25.854
What's the matter with you?

12:30.066 --> 12:31.693
Linda.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.820
Linda.

13:00.847 --> 13:05.894
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Being Stupid."</i>

13:07.938 --> 13:09.231
Can I ask you a favour, miss?

13:09.439 --> 13:13.318
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

13:13.526 --> 13:16.029
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

13:16.279 --> 13:18.240
...looking smalltime.

13:19.115 --> 13:23.536
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

13:23.787 --> 13:26.998
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

13:27.958 --> 13:33.088
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

13:39.803 --> 13:42.138
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

13:42.389 --> 13:43.682
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.643
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

13:46.893 --> 13:50.105
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

13:50.313 --> 13:52.941
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

13:53.149 --> 13:55.277
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

13:55.485 --> 13:58.405
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

13:58.655 --> 14:01.616
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

14:01.825 --> 14:05.245
- <i>We...</i>
- Thank you very much.

14:05.495 --> 14:06.621
I need to go.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.915
I'll bring this back.

14:09.165 --> 14:12.294
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:18.675 --> 14:23.138
<i>Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.</i>
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

14:23.346 --> 14:24.973
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:25.181 --> 14:30.645
<i>Like I said, this part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Being Stupid."</i>

14:33.857 --> 14:38.528
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay...!

14:46.536 --> 14:48.830
Stop! Stop!

14:49.039 --> 14:52.250
Don't move!
Stop this...! Stop the train!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.587
Stop! Stop!

15:10.560 --> 15:14.231
<i>The programme took just 20 people</i>
<i>every six months.</i>

15:14.481 --> 15:16.524
<i>One got the job.</i>

15:18.068 --> 15:23.448
<i>There were three blank lines after</i>
<i>"high school" to list more education.</i>

15:24.991 --> 15:27.786
<i>I didn't need that many lines.</i>

15:32.916 --> 15:35.877
Try and sleep. It's late.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.432
<i>It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches</i>
<i>by 3 inches on each side...</i>

15:49.683 --> 15:52.060
<i>... made up of multiple colours</i>
<i>that you twist and turn...</i>

15:52.269 --> 15:54.896
<i>... and try to get</i>
<i>to a solid colour on each side.</i>

15:55.105 --> 15:58.733
<i>This little cube</i>
<i>is the gift sensation of 1981.</i>

15:58.942 --> 16:00.318
<i>Don't expect to solve it easily.</i>

16:00.527 --> 16:02.946
<i>Although we did encounter</i>
<i>one math professor at USF...</i>

16:03.196 --> 16:05.657
<i>... who took just 30 minutes on his.</i>

16:05.865 --> 16:08.076
<i>This is as far as I've gotten</i>
<i>on mine.</i>

16:08.285 --> 16:11.663
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>I still have a long way to go.</i>

16:11.871 --> 16:14.499
<i>This is Jim Finnerty reporting</i>
<i>for KJSF in Richmond.</i>

16:14.708 --> 16:17.419
Hey, wake up.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.129
Eat.

16:20.297 --> 16:22.716
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

16:22.966 --> 16:25.927
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

16:26.136 --> 16:29.055
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

16:29.306 --> 16:31.683
Goodbye and good riddance.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.852
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.103
Bye, Mom.

16:36.646 --> 16:37.981
Bye.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.776
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

16:41.985 --> 16:45.113
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

16:45.322 --> 16:47.073
But it's not spelled right.

16:47.324 --> 16:50.869
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

16:51.077 --> 16:54.205
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

16:54.414 --> 16:59.294
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

16:59.502 --> 17:02.380
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.758
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

17:05.090 --> 17:07.051
My nickname.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.845
We pick nicknames.

17:09.095 --> 17:12.432
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

17:15.435 --> 17:17.479
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

17:17.686 --> 17:20.397
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

17:20.607 --> 17:23.484
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

17:23.693 --> 17:28.323
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

17:28.531 --> 17:32.118
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

17:32.702 --> 17:34.829
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

17:35.121 --> 17:36.831
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

17:37.290 --> 17:40.835
- How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

17:41.544 --> 17:44.589
- You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?
- Yeah.

17:45.715 --> 17:47.717
When? When do you watch it?

17:47.968 --> 17:51.596
- After snack? After your nap?
- After <i>Love Boat.</i>

17:56.559 --> 17:58.687
I made my list for my birthday.

17:59.479 --> 18:03.984
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

18:07.571 --> 18:11.866
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

18:12.075 --> 18:15.161
- <i>Love Boat?</i>
- For history. Navy.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.622
That's not the Navy.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.958
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

18:20.166 --> 18:24.546
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

18:24.796 --> 18:27.132
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

18:27.340 --> 18:31.136
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

18:33.013 --> 18:38.226
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

18:39.769 --> 18:43.523
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

18:43.773 --> 18:45.191
Bye.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.448
<i>I was waiting for</i>
<i>Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...</i>

19:33.740 --> 19:39.204
<i>... whose name sounded so delightful,</i>
<i>like he’d give me a job and a hug.</i>

19:39.412 --> 19:43.416
<i>I just had to show him I was good</i>
<i>with numbers and good with people.</i>

19:43.625 --> 19:45.168
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.
- Good morning.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.795
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

19:47.045 --> 19:49.798
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

19:50.006 --> 19:53.385
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

19:53.593 --> 19:55.804
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

19:56.012 --> 19:58.807
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

19:59.015 --> 20:01.977
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

20:09.067 --> 20:10.652
<i>Hey, yeah, how you doing?</i>

20:10.860 --> 20:13.029
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.407
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.119
I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

20:19.369 --> 20:21.871
Right. We can still...? Half an hour?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.750
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

20:35.302 --> 20:38.430
Hey! Hey!

20:39.556 --> 20:40.890
Hey!

20:41.099 --> 20:42.475
<i>This part of my life...</i>

20:42.726 --> 20:45.395
- Wait!
- <i>... this part here...</i>

20:46.980 --> 20:48.565
<i>... it's called "Running."</i>

20:48.815 --> 20:50.692
Hey! Hey!

20:50.901 --> 20:52.485
Wait!

20:53.403 --> 20:56.197
Hey! Wait!

20:56.406 --> 20:58.783
<i>That was my stolen machine.</i>

20:58.992 --> 21:01.036
<i>Unless she was with</i>
<i>a guy who sold them too.</i>

21:02.579 --> 21:03.830
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

21:04.039 --> 21:06.750
<i>... because I was the only one</i>
<i>selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

21:06.917 --> 21:09.544
<i>I spent our entire life savings</i>
<i>on these things.</i>

21:12.005 --> 21:15.550
<i>It was such</i>
<i>a revolutionary machine.</i>

21:16.760 --> 21:18.136
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.888
You got me doing all the work.

21:20.096 --> 21:22.599
<i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>is that doctors and hospitals...</i>

21:22.807 --> 21:26.686
<i>... would consider them</i>
<i>unnecessary luxuries.</i>

21:29.356 --> 21:32.734
<i>I even asked the landlord</i>
<i>to take a picture.</i>

21:34.027 --> 21:38.907
<i>So if I lost one, it was like losing</i>
<i>a month's groceries.</i>

21:41.868 --> 21:44.788
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

21:47.707 --> 21:50.377
Hey, get back here!

21:54.965 --> 21:57.425
Hey, man, I...

21:59.302 --> 22:01.596
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

22:12.148 --> 22:15.986
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

22:16.987 --> 22:19.447
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

22:19.656 --> 22:22.867
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

22:33.253 --> 22:34.796
Hey.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.342
Hey, Mom.

22:44.681 --> 22:48.560
One, two, three!

22:49.686 --> 22:52.772
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

22:53.023 --> 22:54.691
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

22:54.941 --> 22:58.820
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.489
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.993
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

23:10.874 --> 23:15.253
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

23:26.473 --> 23:29.017
You should've seen me
out there today.

23:29.226 --> 23:31.770
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

23:31.978 --> 23:33.563
Whatever.

23:35.148 --> 23:38.235
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.654
What the hell
you got attitude about?

23:40.904 --> 23:43.657
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

23:43.907 --> 23:45.200
Hey, Roy. Roy!

23:45.408 --> 23:47.702
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

23:47.911 --> 23:49.371
There's dust and shit all over.

23:49.579 --> 23:51.957
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

23:52.165 --> 23:54.918
Look, Linda, relax.

23:55.168 --> 23:58.463
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

23:59.589 --> 24:03.468
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

24:03.677 --> 24:08.682
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.074
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

24:26.283 --> 24:28.952
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.996
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

24:31.204 --> 24:34.249
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

24:34.457 --> 24:36.710
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

24:36.960 --> 24:38.878
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

24:39.129 --> 24:42.382
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

24:42.632 --> 24:44.926
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.886
How about we share a ride?

24:48.388 --> 24:50.557
- All right, get in.
- All right.

24:56.646 --> 24:59.399
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

24:59.649 --> 25:02.444
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

25:02.652 --> 25:07.282
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

25:07.490 --> 25:09.034
...when he'd leave me in the office.

25:09.242 --> 25:14.497
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

25:15.999 --> 25:18.793
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

25:19.002 --> 25:21.212
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.425
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

25:25.675 --> 25:28.345
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

25:28.762 --> 25:31.932
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

25:32.515 --> 25:33.725
Give it here.

25:36.686 --> 25:40.982
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.734
Sorry.

25:43.276 --> 25:49.241
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

25:49.449 --> 25:52.535
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

25:52.786 --> 25:55.247
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

25:55.455 --> 25:59.084
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

25:59.292 --> 26:02.337
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

26:02.545 --> 26:04.256
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

26:04.464 --> 26:05.632
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

26:05.882 --> 26:07.759
I'm telling you, no one can.

26:09.719 --> 26:11.930
See? That's all I ever do.

26:24.818 --> 26:27.112
You almost have this side.

26:27.737 --> 26:29.197
Holy cow.

26:39.416 --> 26:43.211
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.512
Look at that.

27:15.785 --> 27:16.995
You're almost there.

27:40.727 --> 27:44.439
- 1710.
- This is me.

27:46.566 --> 27:47.943
Good job.

27:49.819 --> 27:52.906
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.035
Where are you going, sir?

27:57.244 --> 28:00.247
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

28:03.583 --> 28:05.293
Two... A couple of blocks.

28:05.502 --> 28:08.922
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.592
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

28:53.967 --> 28:55.510
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

28:55.719 --> 28:58.555
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

28:58.805 --> 29:00.098
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

29:00.307 --> 29:02.309
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

29:02.559 --> 29:05.061
Please! He should've paid you!

29:05.312 --> 29:06.813
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

29:07.063 --> 29:08.690
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

29:09.232 --> 29:12.360
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.497
I'll get you!

29:24.748 --> 29:28.209
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

29:43.600 --> 29:45.685
Hey!

29:45.936 --> 29:48.772
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

29:49.105 --> 29:51.149
Stop him!

29:54.611 --> 29:57.072
Stop him!

30:02.369 --> 30:04.037
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

30:04.287 --> 30:07.082
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

30:15.048 --> 30:18.134
No! No! No!

30:20.804 --> 30:22.597
No!

30:45.829 --> 30:48.123
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, yeah.

30:48.331 --> 30:50.041
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

30:50.250 --> 30:54.462
- <i>Chris, I missed my shift.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

30:54.671 --> 30:57.966
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

30:58.174 --> 31:00.552
<i>I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

31:00.760 --> 31:02.762
- What?
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

31:03.680 --> 31:07.559
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

31:07.767 --> 31:09.311
...and we're gonna leave now.

31:09.686 --> 31:11.062
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down.</i>

31:11.271 --> 31:14.816
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...
- <i>I'm going to leave. We are leaving.</i>

31:20.030 --> 31:23.950
<i>It was right then that I started</i>
<i>thinking about Thomas Jefferson...</i>

31:25.285 --> 31:27.704
<i>... the Declaration of Independence...</i>

31:28.038 --> 31:34.002
<i>... and the part about our right to life,</i>
<i>liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</i>

31:34.210 --> 31:36.046
<i>And I remember thinking.</i>

31:36.296 --> 31:40.634
<i>How did he know</i>
<i>to put the "pursuit" part in there?</i>

31:40.884 --> 31:45.513
<i>That maybe happiness is something</i>
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

31:45.722 --> 31:48.767
<i>And maybe we can actually</i>
<i>never have it...</i>

31:49.142 --> 31:50.769
<i>... no matter what.</i>

31:50.977 --> 31:52.687
<i>How did he know that?</i>

31:57.901 --> 32:00.695
Linda. Linda.

32:33.687 --> 32:35.355
- Hello?
- <i>Chris.</i>

32:35.605 --> 32:38.191
- Who is this?
- <i>Jay Twistle.</i>

32:39.025 --> 32:40.860
- Hey.
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>

32:41.111 --> 32:43.780
Yeah, of course. How are you?

32:43.947 --> 32:46.408
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still</i>
<i>wanna come in and talk?</i>

32:46.616 --> 32:47.909
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

32:48.118 --> 32:50.996
<i>I'll tell you what. Come on by</i>
<i>day after tomorrow, in the morning.</i>

32:51.204 --> 32:54.958
<i>We're interviewing for the internships.</i>
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

32:55.208 --> 32:56.751
Yes. Yes, I do.

32:59.713 --> 33:02.465
- Hold on one second.
- <i>All right.</i>

33:06.386 --> 33:08.471
<i>Hello?</i>

33:08.722 --> 33:11.016
- <i>Chris?</i>
- Go ahead. I have one.

33:11.224 --> 33:13.852
<i>Write this number down so you can</i>
<i>call my secretary, Janice.</i>

33:14.060 --> 33:16.104
- <i>She can give you all the specifics.</i>
- Yep.

33:16.313 --> 33:18.189
- <i>Okay, 415.</i>
- 415.

33:18.398 --> 33:20.108
- <i>864.</i>
- 864.

33:20.317 --> 33:22.319
- <i>0256.</i>
- 0256.

33:22.569 --> 33:25.530
- <i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
- 4796.

33:25.739 --> 33:29.993
- <i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

33:30.243 --> 33:31.494
- <i>Okay, buddy.</i>
- All right, yes.

33:31.745 --> 33:33.872
- Thank you very much.
- <i>We'll see you soon.</i>

33:34.664 --> 33:37.792
864-0256.

33:38.001 --> 33:41.212
4796. Janice.

33:44.257 --> 33:46.092
- Chris.
- Hey.

33:46.343 --> 33:48.553
Did you...? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

33:48.762 --> 33:50.639
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

33:50.847 --> 33:52.224
You didn't see that, 118, 1...?

33:52.432 --> 33:54.643
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

33:54.851 --> 33:58.480
- No, I haven't seen them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.815
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

34:01.024 --> 34:02.651
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

34:02.859 --> 34:04.986
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

34:05.195 --> 34:07.822
- What's your problem with numbers?
- <i>864-2...</i>

34:08.031 --> 34:09.949
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.909
You owe me $14.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.995
I'm gonna get that to you.

34:14.871 --> 34:17.331
I need my money.
I need my money.

34:18.458 --> 34:20.502
Fourteen's a number.

34:46.987 --> 34:50.197
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

34:50.407 --> 34:51.699
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

34:51.908 --> 34:53.702
Don't take my son away
from me again.

34:53.909 --> 34:55.704
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

34:55.911 --> 34:59.207
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

34:59.416 --> 35:00.917
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.962
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

35:05.255 --> 35:07.048
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

35:07.257 --> 35:09.801
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

35:10.010 --> 35:12.304
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

35:12.512 --> 35:15.599
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

35:15.849 --> 35:18.393
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

35:18.602 --> 35:19.978
Just go get happy.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.397
But Christopher's living with me.

35:22.606 --> 35:24.399
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

35:24.691 --> 35:27.068
Christopher's living with me!

35:53.303 --> 35:56.181
Hey. Come on, let's go.

35:56.389 --> 35:58.725
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

36:02.395 --> 36:04.940
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

36:05.148 --> 36:08.610
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.862
Yeah, I know.

36:11.988 --> 36:16.618
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

36:22.082 --> 36:24.292
Where do I sleep tonight?

36:24.501 --> 36:26.628
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

36:26.836 --> 36:29.464
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

36:29.673 --> 36:33.134
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

36:33.343 --> 36:34.886
- Yeah.
- All right.

36:35.136 --> 36:37.138
You're sleeping with me.

36:37.347 --> 36:41.977
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

36:56.491 --> 36:58.118
Christopher.

37:15.719 --> 37:18.513
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

37:18.722 --> 37:20.140
I can't wait anymore.

37:20.390 --> 37:22.726
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

37:22.976 --> 37:25.979
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

37:26.229 --> 37:27.731
It's half what you pay here.

37:27.981 --> 37:31.359
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

37:32.736 --> 37:34.863
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

37:35.071 --> 37:36.281
I got painters coming in.

37:36.489 --> 37:38.783
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

37:38.992 --> 37:41.119
All right, I'll paint it myself.

37:41.328 --> 37:46.708
All right, but I just... I gotta have some
more time... I got my son up in here.

37:51.588 --> 37:56.384
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

38:48.311 --> 38:49.896
Chris Gardner?

38:50.480 --> 38:53.191
Yeah. What happened?

38:53.400 --> 38:57.279
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

38:57.487 --> 39:00.949
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

39:01.157 --> 39:02.617
This is all I got.

39:08.164 --> 39:10.834
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

39:11.334 --> 39:14.379
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

39:16.590 --> 39:18.133
No.

39:18.341 --> 39:20.135
No, I can't spend the night here.

39:20.385 --> 39:22.929
- I have to pick up my son.
- We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

39:23.179 --> 39:27.767
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10: 15 tomorrow morning.

39:27.976 --> 39:29.644
- I cannot stay...
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

39:29.853 --> 39:32.188
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

39:32.397 --> 39:34.858
- Is there anyone else who can...?
- I take care of him.

39:35.108 --> 39:38.111
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

39:42.198 --> 39:45.827
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

39:49.080 --> 39:51.291
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

39:51.541 --> 39:53.209
What do you want?

39:54.377 --> 39:59.007
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

40:00.216 --> 40:03.845
Just keep him for the night and I'm...
And... Just one night.

40:04.054 --> 40:06.097
<i>What happened?</i>

40:06.306 --> 40:09.768
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

40:09.976 --> 40:11.728
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

40:11.978 --> 40:14.231
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

40:14.606 --> 40:18.026
- No.
- <i>Come on, Linda.</i>

40:18.276 --> 40:22.489
- <i>Why you doing that?</i>
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

40:22.948 --> 40:27.035
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

40:28.328 --> 40:30.413
- How is he?
- He's fine.

40:30.664 --> 40:33.708
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park...

40:33.917 --> 40:37.712
...and bring him back, all right?

40:37.921 --> 40:40.882
All right, just bring me my son back.

40:41.841 --> 40:43.718
<i>Okay?</i>

40:43.927 --> 40:45.470
<i>Linda?</i>

40:45.679 --> 40:47.556
I'll bring him back around 6.

40:49.432 --> 40:51.601
All right, all right.

40:51.851 --> 40:53.687
Thank you.

40:56.106 --> 40:57.607
Bye.

41:22.465 --> 41:24.134
I'm okay?

41:59.085 --> 42:01.212
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:01.755 --> 42:03.214
Yes, I did.

42:11.848 --> 42:13.642
Mr. Gardner.

42:20.774 --> 42:22.651
This way.

42:24.861 --> 42:26.905
It'll be right over there.

42:39.042 --> 42:40.377
What is the one like that one?

43:02.065 --> 43:03.942
Chris Gardner.

43:06.570 --> 43:08.196
Chris Gardner.

43:08.655 --> 43:10.615
How are you? Good morning.

43:11.241 --> 43:15.078
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

43:15.287 --> 43:17.247
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

43:18.915 --> 43:21.001
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

43:21.251 --> 43:22.752
...trying to come up with a story...

43:23.003 --> 43:27.215
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

43:27.424 --> 43:31.469
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

43:31.678 --> 43:36.516
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

43:36.766 --> 43:41.396
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

43:42.647 --> 43:44.357
So the truth is...

43:44.608 --> 43:47.193
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

43:47.444 --> 43:49.237
Parking tickets?

43:49.779 --> 43:53.325
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

43:53.575 --> 43:55.535
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

43:55.785 --> 43:58.747
I was painting my apartment.

43:58.955 --> 44:01.124
Is it dry now?

44:01.917 --> 44:03.084
I hope so.

44:03.293 --> 44:05.003
Jay says you're pretty determined.

44:05.211 --> 44:07.589
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

44:07.797 --> 44:09.925
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

44:10.133 --> 44:13.511
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.723
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

44:16.973 --> 44:18.934
Have you already started learning
on your own?

44:19.142 --> 44:20.810
Absolutely.

44:21.561 --> 44:23.355
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

44:23.563 --> 44:25.649
How many times
have you seen Chris?

44:25.899 --> 44:28.526
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

44:29.152 --> 44:31.488
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

44:31.738 --> 44:33.907
No. Jacket and tie.

44:35.825 --> 44:38.703
First in your class in school?

44:38.954 --> 44:40.747
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

44:41.164 --> 44:44.167
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

44:44.417 --> 44:46.127
It was a small town.

44:46.586 --> 44:49.923
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

44:50.173 --> 44:53.385
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

44:55.887 --> 44:57.681
Can I say something?

44:58.848 --> 45:00.559
I'm the type of person...

45:00.767 --> 45:04.020
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

45:04.229 --> 45:06.481
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

45:06.690 --> 45:08.024
But I bet you what.

45:08.275 --> 45:13.238
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

45:14.447 --> 45:16.157
Is that fair enough?

45:17.450 --> 45:18.618
Chris.

45:19.953 --> 45:23.665
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

45:23.873 --> 45:25.875
...without a shirt on...

45:26.126 --> 45:29.004
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

45:33.300 --> 45:36.344
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

45:51.067 --> 45:54.613
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

45:54.821 --> 45:57.073
...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

45:57.324 --> 45:59.701
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

46:00.327 --> 46:02.829
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

46:03.663 --> 46:05.916
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

46:06.166 --> 46:08.084
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

46:08.335 --> 46:10.420
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

46:10.670 --> 46:13.381
- You stood here...
- Listen, there's no salary.

46:13.590 --> 46:14.966
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

46:15.175 --> 46:16.760
My circumstances
have changed some...

46:17.344 --> 46:21.014
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...
- All right. Okay.

46:24.184 --> 46:25.727
Tonight.

46:25.936 --> 46:29.439
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

46:29.689 --> 46:32.651
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

46:32.859 --> 46:35.820
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

46:36.112 --> 46:39.532
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

46:42.452 --> 46:44.996
You are a piece of work.

46:46.039 --> 46:47.582
Tonight.

46:55.882 --> 46:57.842
<i>There was no salary.</i>

46:58.051 --> 47:01.221
<i>Not even a reasonable promise</i>
<i>of a job.</i>

47:07.894 --> 47:12.524
<i>One intern was hired at the end</i>
<i>of the programme from a pool of 20.</i>

47:12.899 --> 47:14.150
<i>And if you weren't that guy...</i>

47:14.401 --> 47:16.736
<i>... you couldn't even apply</i>
<i>the six months' training...</i>

47:16.987 --> 47:18.780
<i>... to another brokerage.</i>

47:21.324 --> 47:23.451
<i>The only resource I would have</i>
<i>for six months...</i>

47:23.660 --> 47:27.581
<i>... would be my six scanners,</i>
<i>which I could still try to sell.</i>

47:28.832 --> 47:32.252
<i>If I sold them all,</i>
<i>maybe we might get by.</i>

48:19.132 --> 48:22.344
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

48:22.552 --> 48:24.095
All right.

48:30.477 --> 48:32.354
Okay, baby.

48:44.908 --> 48:46.701
I got it.

48:51.665 --> 48:53.708
I'm going to New York.

49:23.196 --> 49:25.490
My sister's boyfriend...

49:26.116 --> 49:29.578
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

49:30.370 --> 49:32.831
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

49:35.792 --> 49:37.711
Christopher's staying with me.

49:44.634 --> 49:47.470
I'm his mom, you know?

49:47.721 --> 49:49.764
He should be with his mom.

49:49.973 --> 49:51.850
I should have him, right?

49:52.726 --> 49:55.103
You know
you can't take care of him.

50:02.986 --> 50:04.529
What are you gonna do for money?

50:06.823 --> 50:12.287
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

50:12.495 --> 50:13.955
...and I got it.

50:14.164 --> 50:16.708
So I'm gonna stand out
in my programme.

50:18.418 --> 50:20.503
Salesman to intern's backwards.

50:20.754 --> 50:22.631
No, it's not.

50:24.841 --> 50:26.468
I gotta go.

51:00.043 --> 51:02.420
Tell him I love him, okay?

51:03.046 --> 51:04.673
<i>And...</i>

51:10.637 --> 51:12.931
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

51:13.139 --> 51:14.849
I know that.

51:56.433 --> 51:59.185
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>
- Yes, hi.

51:59.519 --> 52:03.231
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

52:03.440 --> 52:06.985
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

52:07.193 --> 52:08.320
The message is:

52:08.528 --> 52:14.200
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the programme.

52:14.451 --> 52:20.248
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

52:20.457 --> 52:22.334
<i>Is that all?</i>

52:22.626 --> 52:24.169
Yes, that's it.

52:24.377 --> 52:26.129
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thank you.

52:26.379 --> 52:27.923
<i>Bye.</i>

52:54.491 --> 52:55.784
- Be careful with that.
- What?

52:55.992 --> 52:58.787
Be care... Go ahead.

53:22.686 --> 53:25.564
- Are we there?
- Yep.

53:38.868 --> 53:41.413
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

53:41.621 --> 53:43.290
- What?
- Saturday.

53:43.540 --> 53:45.792
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

53:46.042 --> 53:48.420
- What?
- Basketball.

53:48.628 --> 53:51.506
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

53:51.715 --> 53:54.301
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

53:54.551 --> 53:58.763
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

53:59.973 --> 54:02.350
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

54:04.060 --> 54:06.021
I'm going pro.

54:07.314 --> 54:08.690
Okay.

54:08.899 --> 54:11.693
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

54:12.402 --> 54:14.654
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

54:14.905 --> 54:17.949
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

54:18.325 --> 54:21.953
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

54:22.162 --> 54:24.789
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

54:24.998 --> 54:27.876
...I really... You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

54:28.084 --> 54:30.503
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

54:30.754 --> 54:32.214
- All right?
- All right.

54:32.422 --> 54:34.257
Okay.

54:35.425 --> 54:37.052
All right, go ahead.

55:00.867 --> 55:02.494
Hey.

55:05.705 --> 55:07.999
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

55:08.208 --> 55:10.752
...you can't do something.

55:11.461 --> 55:13.588
Not even me.

55:14.965 --> 55:18.093
- All right?
- All right.

55:18.802 --> 55:20.971
You got a dream...

55:21.221 --> 55:23.431
...you gotta protect it.

55:24.558 --> 55:26.184
People can't do something
themselves...

55:26.393 --> 55:28.812
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

55:33.149 --> 55:36.945
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

55:44.995 --> 55:46.580
Let's go.

55:49.666 --> 55:52.210
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

55:52.419 --> 55:54.880
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

55:56.172 --> 55:59.175
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

55:59.426 --> 56:02.137
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

56:03.346 --> 56:06.308
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

56:06.850 --> 56:09.060
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

56:09.269 --> 56:11.479
I don't know, Christopher.

56:11.855 --> 56:13.773
Dad, listen to this.

56:14.024 --> 56:17.444
One day, a man was <i>drownding</i>
in the water.

56:17.694 --> 56:20.113
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

56:20.363 --> 56:22.657
He said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

56:22.866 --> 56:26.036
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

56:26.286 --> 56:28.622
And he said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

56:28.872 --> 56:30.957
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

56:31.207 --> 56:34.377
And he said, " God,
why didn't you save me?"

56:34.628 --> 56:38.089
And God said, " I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

56:39.382 --> 56:40.842
Do you like it?

56:41.051 --> 56:43.762
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

56:49.809 --> 56:51.436
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56:51.645 --> 56:53.271
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

56:53.480 --> 56:54.856
All the information you'll need.

56:55.065 --> 56:56.691
Thank you very much
for your business.

56:56.900 --> 56:58.401
Thank you.

57:01.154 --> 57:03.865
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

57:04.074 --> 57:05.700
...7, 8, 9, 10.

57:06.326 --> 57:07.369
Thank you.

57:09.746 --> 57:12.666
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

57:12.916 --> 57:15.168
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

57:16.086 --> 57:19.589
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

57:33.853 --> 57:37.524
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Internship."</i>

57:37.774 --> 57:41.069
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

57:41.278 --> 57:43.572
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

57:43.780 --> 57:45.657
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

57:45.865 --> 57:47.701
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

57:47.951 --> 57:51.037
...from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

57:51.371 --> 57:54.040
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

57:54.291 --> 57:57.002
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

57:57.210 --> 58:00.213
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

58:00.463 --> 58:03.675
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

58:03.884 --> 58:06.803
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

58:07.053 --> 58:11.933
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

58:12.142 --> 58:14.269
...we'll cook the fish.

58:15.061 --> 58:17.105
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

58:17.314 --> 58:19.691
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

58:19.983 --> 58:22.444
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

58:22.652 --> 58:24.863
That person's gonna be the guy...

58:25.071 --> 58:27.324
...who can turn this into this.

58:27.574 --> 58:30.619
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

58:31.161 --> 58:32.954
You, you, help me hand these out.

58:33.830 --> 58:36.875
This is going to be your bible.

58:37.083 --> 58:38.418
You'll eat with it.

58:38.668 --> 58:40.295
- You'll drink with it.
- <i>It was simple.</i>

58:40.503 --> 58:43.465
<i>X number of calls</i>
<i>equals X number of prospects.</i>

58:43.673 --> 58:46.635
<i>X number of prospects</i>
<i>equals X number of customers.</i>

58:46.927 --> 58:50.013
<i>X number of customers</i>
<i>equals X number of dollars...</i>

58:50.263 --> 58:52.390
- <i>... in the company's pocket.</i>
- Your board exam.

58:52.599 --> 58:58.480
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

58:58.688 --> 59:02.025
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass-fail.

59:02.275 --> 59:05.654
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

59:05.862 --> 59:08.198
Be safe, score a hundred.

59:09.199 --> 59:12.327
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

59:21.628 --> 59:24.548
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

59:24.798 --> 59:26.967
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

59:27.217 --> 59:31.263
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

59:31.471 --> 59:33.557
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

59:33.807 --> 59:35.600
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

59:35.809 --> 59:38.603
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

59:38.812 --> 59:40.522
Oh, man, I remember mine.

59:40.730 --> 59:43.233
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

59:43.483 --> 59:45.860
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

59:46.069 --> 59:49.447
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

59:49.656 --> 59:51.825
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

59:52.075 --> 59:54.369
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

59:54.578 --> 59:56.913
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

59:57.163 --> 59:59.916
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

01:00:29.446 --> 01:00:33.366
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.536
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:38.914
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

01:00:39.122 --> 01:00:41.416
I'm trying to cross the street.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:45.086
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:45.462 --> 01:00:46.963
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:50.967
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:55.305
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

01:01:01.144 --> 01:01:02.604
Hey.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.775
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:10.320
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.448
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

01:01:14.157 --> 01:01:17.869
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:21.748
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:33.969
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

01:01:34.177 --> 01:01:38.265
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:45.480
Dad.

01:01:46.022 --> 01:01:49.025
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:52.320
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:54.531
I got hit by a car.

01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:57.450
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

01:01:57.617 --> 01:02:01.246
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

01:02:01.454 --> 01:02:04.499
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:06.543
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:09.921
- Were you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:13.008
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

01:02:13.383 --> 01:02:15.218
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:15.468 --> 01:02:17.178
I'll remember that next time.

01:02:19.472 --> 01:02:20.849
<i>And here I was again.</i>

01:02:21.057 --> 01:02:23.685
- <i>Show up early.</i>
- While qualified persons...

01:02:23.977 --> 01:02:27.814
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

01:02:28.064 --> 01:02:29.900
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.152
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:36.239
<i>Favours for Frakesh,</i>

01:02:39.242 --> 01:02:41.661
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

01:02:41.912 --> 01:02:44.748
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:02:44.998 --> 01:02:46.291
Okay, yes, thank you.

01:02:46.499 --> 01:02:47.876
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:51.796
- Chris?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:53.173 --> 01:02:56.343
<i>Feeling underrated</i>
<i>and unappreciated.</i>

01:02:56.676 --> 01:02:58.178
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

01:02:58.428 --> 01:03:00.680
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:02.224
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

01:03:02.432 --> 01:03:05.644
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax...

01:03:05.852 --> 01:03:08.104
Okay, thank you, sir.

01:03:09.272 --> 01:03:13.902
<i>Then catch the bus by 4 to the place</i>

- Hey. Hi, Ralph.

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:25.247
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

01:03:25.455 --> 01:03:27.540
I'm gonna get that for you.

01:03:35.715 --> 01:03:39.135
<i>Whoever brought in the most money</i>

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:44.724
<i>We were all working our way</i>

- Yes, sir.

01:03:47.477 --> 01:03:50.146
- <i>From the doorman to the CEO.</i>
- Okay.

01:03:50.897 --> 01:03:53.525
<i>They'd stay till 7,</i>
<i>but I had Christopher.</i>

01:03:53.733 --> 01:03:56.778
<i>I had to do in six hours</i>
<i>what they do in nine.</i>

01:03:56.987 --> 01:04:00.115
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

01:04:00.323 --> 01:04:01.908
<i>In order not to waste any time...</i>

01:04:02.158 --> 01:04:04.286
<i>... I wasn't hanging up the phone</i>
<i>in between calls.</i>

01:04:04.494 --> 01:04:06.580
Okay, thank you very much.

01:04:08.164 --> 01:04:10.333
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>by not hanging up the phone...</i>

01:04:10.584 --> 01:04:12.502
<i>... I gained another eight minutes</i>
<i>a day.</i>

01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:14.963
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

01:04:15.171 --> 01:04:17.674
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- <i>I wasn't drinking water...</i>

01:04:17.924 --> 01:04:19.926
<i>... so I didn't waste any time</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

01:04:20.176 --> 01:04:22.304
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity...

01:04:22.512 --> 01:04:25.599
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:27.142
<i>But even doing all this...</i>

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:31.438
<i>... after two months, I still didn't have</i>
<i>time to work my way up a sheet.</i>

01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:47.162
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:48.580
<i>Walter Ribbon's office.</i>

- Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

01:05:05.722 --> 01:05:09.142
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.770

- Chris, what's up?
- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:34.209
Hey, do you have five minutes?

01:05:34.417 --> 01:05:36.086
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:39.381
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:42.842
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

01:05:43.093 --> 01:05:46.221
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:49.015
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

01:05:49.266 --> 01:05:50.725
And you have to jimmy that.

01:05:50.934 --> 01:05:52.894
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

01:05:53.103 --> 01:05:57.774
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

01:06:13.957 --> 01:06:15.709
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

01:06:18.962 --> 01:06:20.380
Oh, no!

01:06:21.715 --> 01:06:23.133
Come on.

01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:38.231
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

01:06:43.153 --> 01:06:45.947
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

01:06:50.243 --> 01:06:53.204
No, no, no!

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.092
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

01:07:54.558 --> 01:07:55.725
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:55.976 --> 01:07:58.520
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

01:07:58.728 --> 01:08:00.146
Oh, you just missed him.

01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:04.276
Thank you.

01:08:28.425 --> 01:08:32.261
- What's that?
- Just filling out a cheque...

01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:34.973
...paying some bills...

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.225
...and a parking ticket.

01:08:39.102 --> 01:08:41.145
We don't have a car anymore.

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:43.564
Yep, I know.

01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:50.154
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

01:08:50.363 --> 01:08:52.616
A couple of doctors' offices.

01:08:53.116 --> 01:08:56.912
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:03.835
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

01:09:04.044 --> 01:09:06.880
- Really?
- Possibly.

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:09.758
- All right?
- All right.

01:09:09.966 --> 01:09:12.051
Come on, finish up.

01:09:12.551 --> 01:09:15.513
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

01:09:16.723 --> 01:09:18.308
Really?

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:52.801
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:55.971
And maybe
we're going to the game.

01:09:57.514 --> 01:10:01.434
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:03.478
I don't understand.

01:10:03.687 --> 01:10:06.898
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

01:10:07.107 --> 01:10:09.651
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

01:10:09.859 --> 01:10:12.195
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

01:10:12.445 --> 01:10:15.031
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

01:10:15.282 --> 01:10:17.993
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

01:10:18.201 --> 01:10:21.246
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

01:10:21.454 --> 01:10:22.831
And what does "possibly" mean?

01:10:23.039 --> 01:10:25.500
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:28.253
It means that we're not going
to the game.

01:10:29.963 --> 01:10:33.174
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:41.016
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

01:10:46.563 --> 01:10:48.106
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

01:10:48.315 --> 01:10:51.192
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

01:10:51.735 --> 01:10:54.195
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

01:10:54.404 --> 01:10:55.906
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

01:10:56.156 --> 01:10:58.533
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologise...

01:10:58.742 --> 01:11:01.369
...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

01:11:01.578 --> 01:11:04.206
We were in the neighbourhood
visiting a very close friend...

01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:07.918
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

01:11:08.168 --> 01:11:10.962
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:13.715
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:15.967
Oh, come on. What's that?

01:11:16.218 --> 01:11:19.638
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

01:11:20.472 --> 01:11:23.391
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.228
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

01:11:26.436 --> 01:11:28.230
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

01:11:29.272 --> 01:11:30.607
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:32.484
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

01:11:32.692 --> 01:11:33.818
We were just leaving. Tim!

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.029
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

01:11:36.279 --> 01:11:38.949
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:41.243
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

01:11:41.451 --> 01:11:42.953
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

01:11:43.203 --> 01:11:44.829
You take care. Here, come on.

01:11:45.038 --> 01:11:46.373
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

01:11:46.623 --> 01:11:48.208
Bye, Christopher.

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:49.918
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:53.088
- What...? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

01:11:53.296 --> 01:11:56.424
- Where are your seats?
- We've... We're upper deck.

01:11:56.633 --> 01:11:57.884
We got a box. Come on.

01:11:58.134 --> 01:12:00.262
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:05.392
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

01:12:05.642 --> 01:12:08.061
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

01:12:08.728 --> 01:12:12.440
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

01:12:13.066 --> 01:12:15.277
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

01:12:17.988 --> 01:12:20.949
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

01:12:21.825 --> 01:12:24.035
- Oh, my...
- What happened?

01:12:24.244 --> 01:12:25.620
I think I got stung by a bee.

01:12:25.829 --> 01:12:28.748
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:31.543
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

01:12:31.793 --> 01:12:35.088
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

01:12:35.338 --> 01:12:37.716
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

01:12:37.924 --> 01:12:40.051
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:44.139
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:46.683
<i>Thomas Jefferson mentions</i>
<i>happiness a couple times...</i>

01:12:46.933 --> 01:12:49.686
<i>... in the Declaration</i>
<i>of Independence.</i>

01:12:50.145 --> 01:12:52.689
<i>May seem like a strange word</i>
<i>to be in that document...</i>

01:12:52.939 --> 01:12:57.819
<i>... but he was sort of...</i>
<i>He was an artist.</i>

01:12:58.111 --> 01:13:02.657
<i>He called the English</i>
<i>"the disturbers of our harmony."</i>

01:13:02.949 --> 01:13:04.701
<i>And I remember standing there</i>
<i>that day...</i>

01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:07.203
<i>... thinking about</i>
<i>the disturbers of mine.</i>

01:13:07.454 --> 01:13:11.666
<i>Questions I had.</i>
<i>Whether all this was good.</i>

01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:13.835
<i>Whether I'd make it.</i>

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.841
<i>And Walter Ribbon</i>
<i>and his Pacific Bell pension money...</i>

01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.384
<i>... which was millions.</i>

01:13:21.635 --> 01:13:23.220
Yeah!

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.598
<i>It was a way to another place.</i>

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:29.476
Wow, this is...

01:13:29.893 --> 01:13:31.811
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:35.106
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

01:13:35.315 --> 01:13:38.568
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

01:13:38.818 --> 01:13:41.655
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

01:13:41.988 --> 01:13:44.115
...which we believe
to be far superior...

01:13:44.324 --> 01:13:46.910
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.954
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:54.209
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:56.962
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

01:13:57.170 --> 01:14:00.632
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.926
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:06.263
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

01:14:07.264 --> 01:14:08.515
Yes!

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:13.562
Yes! Yeah!

01:14:18.275 --> 01:14:19.317
- Here you go.
- All right.

01:14:19.526 --> 01:14:21.278
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

01:14:21.528 --> 01:14:24.072
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

01:14:24.281 --> 01:14:25.949
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:27.742
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

01:14:34.624 --> 01:14:37.335
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

01:15:06.823 --> 01:15:11.369
<i>After four months, we had sold</i>
<i>all our scanners.</i>

01:15:12.662 --> 01:15:14.039
<i>It seemed we were making it.</i>

01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:16.208
What's the...

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:19.085
...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:24.716
<i>It seemed we were doing good.</i>

01:15:24.925 --> 01:15:26.676
<i>Until one day...</i>

01:15:26.968 --> 01:15:28.637
<i>... that day...</i>

01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:31.139
<i>... that letter brought me</i>
<i>back to earth.</i>

01:15:38.521 --> 01:15:41.107
<i>This part of my life is called</i>
<i>"Paying Taxes."</i>

01:15:43.193 --> 01:15:44.486
<i>If you didn't pay them...</i>

01:15:44.736 --> 01:15:47.614
<i>... the government could stick</i>
<i>their hands into your bank account...</i>

01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:49.449
<i>... and take your money.</i>

01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:50.659
Dad.

01:15:50.867 --> 01:15:52.869
<i>No warning. Nothing.</i>

01:15:53.078 --> 01:15:56.206
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

01:15:56.456 --> 01:15:59.543
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

01:15:59.876 --> 01:16:01.169
I was... I was...

01:16:01.419 --> 01:16:04.673
Listen, I...
That's all the money that I have.

01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:09.177
You cannot go into my bank acc...
No...

01:16:09.386 --> 01:16:11.763
<i>It was the 25th of September.</i>

01:16:11.972 --> 01:16:13.682
<i>I remember that day.</i>

01:16:13.932 --> 01:16:15.976
<i>Because that's the day</i>
<i>that I found out...</i>

01:16:16.226 --> 01:16:21.314
<i>... there was only 21 dollars</i>
<i>and 33 cents left in my bank account.</i>

01:16:21.565 --> 01:16:23.191
<i>I was broke.</i>

01:16:33.577 --> 01:16:35.871
- Dressed yet?
- No.

01:16:39.749 --> 01:16:43.086
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

01:16:43.336 --> 01:16:46.047
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:49.843
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

01:16:50.093 --> 01:16:51.928
Now!

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.684
Hey, what's happening, man?

01:16:57.934 --> 01:17:00.770
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

01:17:02.439 --> 01:17:04.316
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

01:17:04.524 --> 01:17:07.569
- What? Why?
- Why what?

01:17:07.777 --> 01:17:10.155
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

01:17:10.363 --> 01:17:12.324
I helped you move.

01:17:14.618 --> 01:17:17.454
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

01:17:17.704 --> 01:17:19.414
That's 200 yards.

01:17:19.623 --> 01:17:21.583
It's been four months, Wayne.

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:25.378
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:27.923
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:30.342
- Wayne, get my mo...
- I really don't, man. It's $14.

01:17:30.592 --> 01:17:32.260
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

01:17:32.469 --> 01:17:35.013
- All of this for $14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

01:17:53.406 --> 01:17:55.533
Dad, look at me!

01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:57.702
Dad.

01:17:58.745 --> 01:18:02.249
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

01:18:18.348 --> 01:18:19.349
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

01:18:19.599 --> 01:18:21.142
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:24.145
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

01:18:29.276 --> 01:18:32.737
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

01:18:35.782 --> 01:18:37.409
Dad!

01:18:37.617 --> 01:18:40.996
Dad, wait! Dad!

01:18:49.212 --> 01:18:51.214
- Dad.
- I gotta...

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:54.801
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:59.306
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

01:19:02.392 --> 01:19:05.061
Bring back my time machine!

01:19:06.396 --> 01:19:08.064
Bring my time machine back!

01:19:16.948 --> 01:19:20.535
- Dad, where are we going?
- Be quiet.

01:19:21.161 --> 01:19:23.872
Go get your things. Go.

01:19:47.145 --> 01:19:48.772
- Chris?
- Yes.

01:19:49.022 --> 01:19:52.901
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.540
Where are we going now?

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:10.585
We gotta... We gotta
see somebody else.

01:20:12.712 --> 01:20:14.798
I'm tired.

01:20:16.841 --> 01:20:18.426
I know.

01:20:25.809 --> 01:20:29.938
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

01:20:30.397 --> 01:20:32.649
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

01:20:32.899 --> 01:20:36.736
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:40.824
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

01:20:41.074 --> 01:20:43.869
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

01:20:44.077 --> 01:20:49.291
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

01:20:49.499 --> 01:20:51.626
I really have to go, Chris.

01:20:52.878 --> 01:20:54.546
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:54.754 --> 01:20:56.631
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.508
I'll see you soon.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.938
Why are our things here?

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.565
Dad.

01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:40.819
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

01:22:42.445 --> 01:22:44.739
- Just out of here.
- Why?

01:22:44.948 --> 01:22:47.951
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

01:22:48.201 --> 01:22:51.121
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:56.710
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.420
Stop it.

01:23:02.674 --> 01:23:04.092
Come on.

01:23:13.226 --> 01:23:14.686
Come on.

01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:33.330
<i>Wayne!</i>

01:23:34.456 --> 01:23:36.291
Wayne!

01:23:43.506 --> 01:23:45.800
Wayne!

01:24:01.358 --> 01:24:05.070
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

01:24:20.919 --> 01:24:22.963
Where are we going?

01:24:25.131 --> 01:24:28.468
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

01:24:43.984 --> 01:24:46.361
It's not a time machine.

01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:47.988
Dad.

01:24:48.405 --> 01:24:49.698
It's not a time machine.

01:24:49.906 --> 01:24:53.159
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

01:24:53.577 --> 01:24:55.912
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

01:24:56.162 --> 01:24:58.039
He said it was a time machine.

01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:05.630
Yes, it is.

01:25:07.257 --> 01:25:09.009
No, it's not.

01:25:11.011 --> 01:25:12.971
- It is.
- No, it's not.

01:25:19.227 --> 01:25:23.732
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

01:25:26.943 --> 01:25:28.069
Wanna push it?

01:25:32.616 --> 01:25:34.242
Okay.

01:25:35.785 --> 01:25:37.370
Come on.

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:40.498
Come on, man.

01:25:46.213 --> 01:25:47.255
Right here.

01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:49.257
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

01:25:49.633 --> 01:25:51.593
I don't know.
Some place from before.

01:25:52.135 --> 01:25:53.386
You gotta close your eyes.

01:25:53.678 --> 01:25:55.555
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

01:25:57.724 --> 01:26:00.143
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

01:26:05.982 --> 01:26:07.776
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

01:26:08.485 --> 01:26:10.654
It takes a few seconds.

01:26:13.073 --> 01:26:14.950
Oh, my goodness.

01:26:15.158 --> 01:26:17.369
Open, open, open!

01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:23.416
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

01:26:23.667 --> 01:26:25.794
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:30.840
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

01:26:32.592 --> 01:26:34.970
- Do you see them?
- Yeah.

01:26:35.178 --> 01:26:36.596
Wait. Come on, come on.

01:26:36.846 --> 01:26:38.139
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

01:26:38.348 --> 01:26:40.392
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

01:26:40.767 --> 01:26:42.978
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

01:26:43.228 --> 01:26:44.604
...and it's cold out here, okay?

01:26:45.313 --> 01:26:47.649
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

01:26:47.899 --> 01:26:51.486
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

01:26:52.529 --> 01:26:55.574
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

01:26:55.782 --> 01:26:57.742
We need a cave.

01:26:57.951 --> 01:26:59.035
A cave?

01:26:59.286 --> 01:27:01.288
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

01:27:01.496 --> 01:27:03.248
Come on, come on.

01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:06.209
Watch your back! Look out.

01:27:06.459 --> 01:27:08.461
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

01:27:08.712 --> 01:27:11.548
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

01:27:11.798 --> 01:27:13.008
Go ahead. Get in.

01:27:13.216 --> 01:27:15.051
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.434
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.045
Hey.

01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:35.257
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

01:28:35.465 --> 01:28:36.925
How are you getting along?

01:28:37.133 --> 01:28:39.302
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

01:28:39.511 --> 01:28:42.055
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

01:28:43.181 --> 01:28:44.808
Where you going?

01:28:48.144 --> 01:28:51.106
I... Sacramento.

01:28:51.815 --> 01:28:54.442
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from...

01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:57.279
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over...

01:28:57.487 --> 01:28:58.738
Get them over to us.

01:28:58.989 --> 01:29:00.657
So they got me
going out there golfing.

01:29:00.866 --> 01:29:02.701
Awesome.

01:29:02.951 --> 01:29:04.870
Hey, let them win a round.

01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:12.043
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

01:29:12.294 --> 01:29:15.338
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:26.683
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:30.645
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:29:32.856 --> 01:29:34.482
We need a room.

01:29:35.108 --> 01:29:38.069
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

01:29:38.278 --> 01:29:40.906
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

01:29:41.114 --> 01:29:43.575
- I wish I could help you...
- This is my son, Christopher.

01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:45.911
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

01:29:46.161 --> 01:29:49.164
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

01:29:49.372 --> 01:29:52.250
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

01:29:52.459 --> 01:29:55.503
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

01:29:55.712 --> 01:29:57.130
We gotta stay together.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.673
We got... We're...

01:29:58.882 --> 01:30:00.717
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place...

01:30:00.967 --> 01:30:03.803
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

01:30:04.054 --> 01:30:05.513
So you hurry up. There's a line.

01:30:05.722 --> 01:30:09.100
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

01:30:44.344 --> 01:30:49.975
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

01:30:50.392 --> 01:30:53.270
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

01:30:53.478 --> 01:30:54.688
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

01:30:54.938 --> 01:30:56.481
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:59.109
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't...

01:31:01.528 --> 01:31:03.071
Dad!

01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:05.574
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

01:31:05.782 --> 01:31:07.367
Stop! Stop!

01:31:07.576 --> 01:31:09.870
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.664
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

01:31:12.956 --> 01:31:14.916
I got here on time. I was in line.

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:16.877
I came from work, I got my son.

01:31:17.127 --> 01:31:19.588
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

01:31:19.796 --> 01:31:21.423
He sliced in front of him in line.

01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:23.925
- Who did?
- He did.

01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:28.722
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

01:31:37.981 --> 01:31:39.941
That's it. No more.

01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:49.951
- What's your favourite colour?
- Green.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.411
Green?

01:31:51.661 --> 01:31:54.623
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

01:31:54.831 --> 01:31:57.792
Trees. What else?

01:31:58.001 --> 01:31:59.461
Holly.

01:32:01.254 --> 01:32:05.217
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

01:32:06.009 --> 01:32:07.969
Christmas stuff.

01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:10.513
What's that?

01:32:13.767 --> 01:32:16.645
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

01:32:23.193 --> 01:32:28.198
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

01:32:28.698 --> 01:32:30.367
Can he breathe?

01:32:30.617 --> 01:32:32.827
- He's good?
- Yeah.

01:32:33.286 --> 01:32:35.288
- I gotta go work on the scanner...
- Don't go.

01:32:35.539 --> 01:32:38.667
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:43.004
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

01:32:43.547 --> 01:32:46.216
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

01:32:46.383 --> 01:32:48.885
I wanna go home.

01:32:50.971 --> 01:32:54.766
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

01:32:55.725 --> 01:32:57.477
All right?

01:32:57.727 --> 01:32:59.604
I'm gonna go out there.

01:32:59.813 --> 01:33:03.191
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

01:33:04.317 --> 01:33:05.986
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

01:33:06.987 --> 01:33:09.072
- All right?
- All right.

01:33:09.322 --> 01:33:11.616
You gotta trust me, okay?

01:33:11.825 --> 01:33:13.869
You gotta trust me.

01:33:14.744 --> 01:33:17.372
I trust you. I trust you.

01:33:17.581 --> 01:33:19.040
I trust you.

01:33:19.249 --> 01:33:22.210
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

01:33:26.089 --> 01:33:27.757
Give me a kiss.

01:33:40.437 --> 01:33:43.398
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

01:33:43.857 --> 01:33:46.318
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

01:33:46.526 --> 01:33:48.737
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

01:33:48.945 --> 01:33:50.405
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:33:50.697 --> 01:33:53.116
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:41.998
- Yeah.
- Like that?

01:34:42.249 --> 01:34:45.877
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

01:34:46.086 --> 01:34:49.589
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

01:34:49.839 --> 01:34:50.840
Good.

01:34:52.175 --> 01:34:54.427
Let's go. Get your stuff.

01:34:55.679 --> 01:34:58.640
- Dad, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

01:34:58.848 --> 01:35:00.976
We're gonna have
a different room later.

01:35:01.184 --> 01:35:02.727
Go.

01:35:08.108 --> 01:35:09.442
Hey, Chris.

01:35:09.693 --> 01:35:12.988
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:15.156
Work trip.

01:35:15.365 --> 01:35:17.659
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

01:35:17.868 --> 01:35:19.619
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:21.496
...looking to retire at the same time?

01:35:21.705 --> 01:35:23.790
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.417
...without paying a lot of taxes.

01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:29.129
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

01:35:29.713 --> 01:35:31.631
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal?

01:35:31.882 --> 01:35:33.717
<i>I learned to finish my work quickly.</i>

01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:36.219
<i>I had to finish quickly.</i>

01:35:36.553 --> 01:35:40.056
<i>To get in line at Glide by 5.</i>

01:35:43.810 --> 01:35:45.687
Come on.

01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:47.772
Come on.

01:35:51.902 --> 01:35:54.654
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

01:35:55.572 --> 01:35:57.282
My Captain America!

01:35:57.574 --> 01:35:59.826
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:36:00.076 --> 01:36:03.288
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

01:36:05.665 --> 01:36:07.667
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

01:36:07.918 --> 01:36:10.921
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

01:36:19.262 --> 01:36:20.722
Come on.

01:36:23.767 --> 01:36:25.936
Dad, we need to get it!

01:36:28.605 --> 01:36:31.191
<i>The important thing about</i>
<i>that freedom train...</i>

01:36:31.441 --> 01:36:33.568
<i>... is it's got to climb mountains.</i>

01:36:33.777 --> 01:36:36.530
<i>We all have to deal with mountains.</i>

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.658
<i>You know, mountains</i>
<i>that go way up high.</i>

01:36:40.116 --> 01:36:42.077
And mountains that go
deep and low.

01:36:42.285 --> 01:36:43.578
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

01:36:43.787 --> 01:36:46.081
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

01:36:46.373 --> 01:36:48.500
We sing about them.

01:36:49.292 --> 01:36:54.798
<i>Lord, don't move that mountain</i>

01:36:56.216 --> 01:37:02.639
<i>Give me strength to climb it</i>

01:37:03.139 --> 01:37:09.813
<i>Please don't move</i>
<i>That stumbling block</i>

01:37:10.063 --> 01:37:16.611
<i>But lead me, Lord, around it</i>

01:37:18.238 --> 01:37:23.285
<i>My burdens, they get so heavy</i>

01:37:25.161 --> 01:37:30.750
<i>Seems hard to bear</i>

01:37:31.668 --> 01:37:35.255
<i>But I won't give up</i>
<i>No, no</i>

01:37:35.505 --> 01:37:37.465
<i>Because you promised me</i>

01:37:37.674 --> 01:37:44.431
<i>You'd meet me at the altar of prayer</i>

01:37:44.681 --> 01:37:52.147
- <i>Lord don't move that mountain</i>
- <i>Please don't move that mountain</i>

01:37:52.355 --> 01:37:57.652
<i>But give me strength to climb it</i>

01:37:59.863 --> 01:38:01.865
When's your test?

01:38:03.116 --> 01:38:04.576
Tomorrow.

01:38:08.955 --> 01:38:10.749
Are you ready?

01:38:14.711 --> 01:38:16.087
Of course.

01:38:55.252 --> 01:38:56.503
Thank you, sir.

01:39:05.929 --> 01:39:08.056
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

01:39:12.102 --> 01:39:15.063
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere?

01:39:15.272 --> 01:39:17.732
I have to go somewhere.

01:39:18.358 --> 01:39:21.152
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

01:39:21.361 --> 01:39:23.280
- You?
- Yeah.

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.741
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

01:39:27.784 --> 01:39:31.830
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

01:39:32.038 --> 01:39:35.667
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

01:39:45.635 --> 01:39:46.928
Hey, Chris.

01:39:47.137 --> 01:39:50.432
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.102
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

01:39:55.896 --> 01:39:57.814
Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

01:39:58.064 --> 01:40:00.734
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

01:40:01.484 --> 01:40:05.238
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

01:40:05.488 --> 01:40:07.699
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

01:40:07.908 --> 01:40:10.911
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

01:40:16.333 --> 01:40:18.460
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

01:40:18.668 --> 01:40:22.297
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:40:35.685 --> 01:40:38.146
That's it. That's the room quota.

01:40:38.521 --> 01:40:41.274
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

01:40:41.524 --> 01:40:44.361
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

01:40:44.611 --> 01:40:47.572
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

01:40:47.781 --> 01:40:52.077
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:28.822
You like it?

01:42:19.873 --> 01:42:23.543
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:30.258
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

01:42:30.467 --> 01:42:33.261
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

01:42:34.387 --> 01:42:37.682
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

01:42:37.891 --> 01:42:39.935
Can I see it?

01:42:41.811 --> 01:42:44.898
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

01:42:45.148 --> 01:42:49.611
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.656
I don't mind.

01:42:53.156 --> 01:42:54.950
Yeah, you will.

01:43:11.258 --> 01:43:13.635
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

01:43:13.843 --> 01:43:14.970
Okay.

01:43:15.178 --> 01:43:18.306
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

01:43:18.598 --> 01:43:20.225
All right.

01:43:22.352 --> 01:43:25.230
Did Mom leave because of me?

01:43:28.608 --> 01:43:32.779
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

01:43:37.367 --> 01:43:41.872
Don't... Don't even think
something like that.

01:43:42.956 --> 01:43:45.083
Mom left because of Mom.

01:43:45.292 --> 01:43:47.544
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

01:43:48.295 --> 01:43:50.171
Okay.

01:44:00.056 --> 01:44:02.058
You're a good papa.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.902
All right, go to sleep.

01:44:12.736 --> 01:44:15.655
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:45:12.128 --> 01:45:14.089
So far, so good, Chris.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.764
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

01:45:22.973 --> 01:45:26.768
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.</i>
<i>Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

01:45:27.143 --> 01:45:31.356
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

01:45:31.565 --> 01:45:34.317
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

01:45:35.485 --> 01:45:37.112
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.613
Thank you. Thank you.

01:45:38.822 --> 01:45:40.782
- You ready?
- Yep.

01:45:42.742 --> 01:45:45.620
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

01:45:45.829 --> 01:45:47.789
Where are we going, then?

01:45:48.582 --> 01:45:51.126
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

01:45:51.334 --> 01:45:52.419
Just for the night.

01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:55.380
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:57.299
No, thank you.

01:45:57.507 --> 01:46:00.051
- Ever?
- I hope not.

01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:01.720
Why not?

01:46:01.928 --> 01:46:04.723
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

01:46:04.931 --> 01:46:07.267
...and then not so much the next.

01:46:07.517 --> 01:46:10.353
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

01:46:10.604 --> 01:46:14.024
<i>I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,</i>
<i>should I?</i>

01:46:14.274 --> 01:46:17.611
<i>It's promised in the Bible.</i>
<i>Pa says we'll find it some day.</i>

01:46:17.861 --> 01:46:20.197
<i>He doesn't know where it is, though.</i>

01:46:21.114 --> 01:46:24.326
<i>Didn't you ever want to have a home</i>
<i>of your own like other people?</i>

01:46:24.534 --> 01:46:26.369
<i>Sure.</i>

01:46:26.786 --> 01:46:28.872
<i>Sometimes when we're moving</i>
<i>at night...</i>

01:46:29.122 --> 01:46:32.250
<i>... we pass houses with lights</i>
<i>and people.</i>

01:46:32.459 --> 01:46:35.212
<i>Sometimes you can</i>
<i>hear them laughing...</i>

01:46:39.466 --> 01:46:42.844
<i>The next day, after work...</i>

01:46:43.053 --> 01:46:45.263
<i>... we just went to the beach.</i>

01:46:45.472 --> 01:46:47.349
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

01:46:47.557 --> 01:46:48.934
<i>Everything.</i>

01:46:49.142 --> 01:46:50.810
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

01:46:52.479 --> 01:46:54.814
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

01:46:55.065 --> 01:46:58.109
<i>Far away from buses and noise...</i>

01:46:58.318 --> 01:47:03.949
<i>... and a constant disappointment</i>
<i>in my ten-gallon head...</i>

01:47:05.158 --> 01:47:06.993
<i>... and in myself.</i>

01:47:07.577 --> 01:47:09.955
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

01:47:10.163 --> 01:47:11.998
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

01:47:12.249 --> 01:47:13.708
Thanks, Chris.

01:47:15.835 --> 01:47:17.128
<i>Because when I was young...</i>

01:47:17.337 --> 01:47:21.091
<i>... and I'd get an A on a history test</i>
<i>or whatever...</i>

01:47:21.341 --> 01:47:25.887
<i>... I'd get this good feeling about</i>
<i>all the things that I could be.</i>

01:47:27.847 --> 01:47:31.434
<i>And then I never became</i>
<i>any of them.</i>

01:47:38.942 --> 01:47:41.486
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

01:47:41.695 --> 01:47:44.322
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

01:47:44.531 --> 01:47:48.660
Rumour has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

01:47:48.869 --> 01:47:50.287
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:50.537 --> 01:47:54.291
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:56.126
I guess.

01:47:59.129 --> 01:48:01.339
So one more day.

01:48:01.548 --> 01:48:03.133
Getting nervous?

01:48:03.717 --> 01:48:06.094
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

01:48:06.303 --> 01:48:08.221
Listen, whatever happens...

01:48:08.471 --> 01:48:10.849
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

01:48:11.057 --> 01:48:12.601
I mean that.

01:48:13.476 --> 01:48:15.270
Take care of yourself.

01:48:30.327 --> 01:48:33.455
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:35.874
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

01:48:36.082 --> 01:48:38.585
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:40.795
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

01:48:41.421 --> 01:48:43.048
Yes, sir.

01:48:43.256 --> 01:48:44.633
No, sir, that's it.

01:48:44.841 --> 01:48:47.302
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

01:48:48.929 --> 01:48:51.806
Chris. Come.

01:49:19.209 --> 01:49:22.295
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

01:49:23.463 --> 01:49:25.340
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

01:49:25.549 --> 01:49:26.758
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

01:49:27.217 --> 01:49:31.471
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

01:49:34.391 --> 01:49:38.478
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

01:49:38.728 --> 01:49:40.647
You know,
being the last day and all.

01:49:40.897 --> 01:49:44.192
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

01:49:45.068 --> 01:49:46.862
But...

01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:49.865
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

01:49:50.073 --> 01:49:52.993
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

01:49:53.743 --> 01:49:56.955
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

01:49:58.331 --> 01:50:00.125
Would you like that, Chris?

01:50:01.084 --> 01:50:02.627
Yes, sir.

01:50:02.836 --> 01:50:06.214
Good. We couldn't be happier.

01:50:07.173 --> 01:50:10.343
So welcome.

01:50:12.262 --> 01:50:17.225
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

01:50:19.603 --> 01:50:21.938
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:50:26.359 --> 01:50:28.028
Thank you, sir.

01:50:28.361 --> 01:50:30.238
Oh, Chris.

01:50:32.782 --> 01:50:34.826
I almost forgot.

01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:38.413
Thank you.

01:50:58.808 --> 01:51:01.019
<i>This part of my life...</i>

01:51:01.978 --> 01:51:04.105
<i>... this little part...</i>

01:51:07.484 --> 01:51:10.111
<i>... is called "Happiness."</i>

01:51:56.867 --> 01:52:00.453
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

01:52:30.150 --> 01:52:32.527
So how many...

01:52:32.736 --> 01:52:34.654
...planets are there?

01:52:35.989 --> 01:52:37.741
- Seven.
- Seven?

01:52:38.241 --> 01:52:40.076
Nine.

01:52:42.495 --> 01:52:44.539
Who's the king of the jungle?

01:52:44.915 --> 01:52:47.667
- Gorilla.
- The gorilla?

01:52:48.001 --> 01:52:49.377
The gorilla?

01:52:49.586 --> 01:52:51.213
No. Lion.

01:52:51.421 --> 01:52:54.049
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

01:52:56.092 --> 01:52:59.095
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

01:52:59.346 --> 01:53:01.223
- Who's there?
- Shelby.

01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:02.557
Shelby who?

01:53:02.766 --> 01:53:06.561
<i>Shelby coming around the mountain</i>
<i>When she comes</i>

01:53:07.437 --> 01:53:08.730
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

01:53:08.939 --> 01:53:11.399
- Nobody.
- Nobody who?

01:53:12.359 --> 01:53:14.069
Nobody who?

01:53:17.447 --> 01:53:20.367
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
