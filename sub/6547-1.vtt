01:16.560 --> 01:20.007
There's no place like home.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.207
There's no place like home.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.520
There's no place like home.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.161
I'm sorry, I just...

01:32.440 --> 01:33.680
This isn't working for me.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.521
What is it now, Imogene?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.247
Okay.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.684
I don't know about you, Ms. Rossi,

01:41.760 --> 01:43.683
but there's not a chance in
hell that I'd go back

01:43.760 --> 01:45.250
to some crap-farm in Kansas.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.607
After seeing all that Oz has to offer.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.160
I mean, it makes zero sense.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.846
- You guys are with me on this, right?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.161
That is the way this story ends.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.571
It's a classic!

01:56.640 --> 01:59.291
It's also a little
provincial, if you ask me.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.441
I didn't.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.967
Can I at least
suggest a more appropriate line?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.202
No! You will do the lines as written

02:06.280 --> 02:07.645
or I am giving the lead to Stacy!

02:14.040 --> 02:17.965
There's no place like home.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.407
Home is really fabulous!

02:20.480 --> 02:22.050
Home is where the heart is!

02:22.760 --> 02:26.082
Blah... Blah... Blah.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.766
Joe, I need a taxi.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.966
No problem.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.369
<i>- This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

02:44.440 --> 02:46.044
Hi, it's me again.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.124
You never came home,
so I assume we're meeting there?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.089
Uh, I hope you're okay.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.161
Call me.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.923
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

03:02.000 --> 03:03.445
Hey, it's me.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.966
If you get there first,
would you wait outside?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.731
I'd really like to walk in together.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.643
Oh, by the way, I just passed the place

03:10.720 --> 03:12.484
where you held my hand
for the first time.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.685
Call me, please.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.046
Call me.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.167
Shit.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.529
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

03:26.600 --> 03:27.601
Okay, I just got here,

03:27.680 --> 03:28.841
and I'm walking in. Are you here?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.684
I'm here.
I'm putting my phone on vibrate.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.721
So just text me so I can find you.
I'm here. Bye.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.324
- Hi. Imogene Duncan.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.284
<i>Two years ago, a young man from Newark</i>

04:20.360 --> 04:25.082
broke into the Whitney Museum
by smashing a window with a brick.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.361
He wanted to look at the pictures.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.850
The crime committed that night had
nothing to do with breaking windows,

04:31.920 --> 04:33.524
or living in New Jersey.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.047
It had to do with denying a child.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.285
Hey, where were you?

04:39.360 --> 04:41.124
I was stuck on a call.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.887
And that's why the Where The
Art ls Foundation was created,

04:45.960 --> 04:50.807
so that no child
ever has to break a window again.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.449
You know, the idea just
sort of came to me,

05:00.520 --> 05:02.124
when James and I were on our honeymoon.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.411
And I realized that
I want to be more than just a wife,

05:07.960 --> 05:11.089
and an author, and an interior designer.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.481
I know, I've been
thinking the same thing.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.005
You know, it's been weighing on me.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.605
But are you even married?

05:17.480 --> 05:19.323
Oh. Mostly. Basically.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.006
We live together, and
we've talked about it.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.970
Peter's family is Dutch.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.087
Yeah, and they're a very
progressive people.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.245
You know, they believe in a spiritual
union, where your souls are bound.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.403
That's what he said to me,
which is very romantic.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.124
It's like how gay people
used to get married.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.529
Oh, Austen and I are
starting a charity for that.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.840
For gay people?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.410
His younger sister is a lesbian,

05:42.480 --> 05:45.290
and we just really
wanted to get involved.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.521
- Wonderful!
- Wow!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.204
I didn't realize she was a lesbian.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.691
I knew she was a lesbian.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.489
I mean, I went to Spence.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.571
Oh, I heard Andover had
a lot of them, too.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.721
Yeah, I know.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.325
Isn't that where you
went to school, Imogene?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.050
Andover? No, that was Peter.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.880
So, where did you...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.086
She's from New Jersey.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.241
Oh.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.362
I love that sculpture

06:08.440 --> 06:10.204
of Abe Lincoln.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.521
That is phenomenal...

06:12.640 --> 06:14.688
He's got a little smirk.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.010
What's he thinking?

06:21.480 --> 06:22.811
I'm stuffed.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.404
They really went all out tonight.
it was so fun.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.442
You know, tonight really made me
contemplate how lucky we are.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.409
And all the beauty
that we just take for granted.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.165
You know, all the museums, the park.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.367
The 100-year-old buildings.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.890
- The trees...
- Imogene,

06:42.320 --> 06:43.651
I should move out.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.161
What?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.764
I've already started
looking at apartments.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.921
- What are you talking about?
- Look,

06:50.000 --> 06:51.570
I can help you with rent
for a couple months

06:51.680 --> 06:53.489
until you figure out what to do.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.409
You're serious? Peter!

06:56.160 --> 06:58.401
You said our souls were bound.
You said that.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.090
I told people that you said that!

07:00.160 --> 07:03.687
This isn't about souls, all right?

07:03.760 --> 07:07.765
This is about
whether two people really go together.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.881
Imogene?
Libby wants to see you in her office.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.084
Right away.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.001
Is that your family?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.321
Oh! Yeah. That's the gang.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.562
- The Vineyard?
- Every summer since I was born.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.721
What about your family?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.922
Um... I grew up in the Atlantic
City area, near the beach, so...

08:16.000 --> 08:17.764
Then every day was like summer, right?

08:17.840 --> 08:19.729
No, every day was not like summer.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.531
Every day was like being impaled
with a blunt, wooden object,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.602
over and over again.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.369
Anyway, I called you in here

08:28.440 --> 08:31.842
because I had a chance
to read over your blurbs.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.244
And, um, yeah, see,
I can't turn these in to Dan.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.731
- Why not?
- Well...

08:37.799 --> 08:41.520
First off, because you
called Dames At Sea,

08:41.600 --> 08:44.251
"An insignificant, if not irritating,

08:44.320 --> 08:48.211
"amalgam of lackluster
performances and sitcom one-liners."

08:48.280 --> 08:50.886
Have you seen it?
Because that's putting it very nicely.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.200
It won the Tony.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.888
And, you know, frankly, we don't care
whether you think it's good or bad.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.961
You're not a reviewer.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.044
No, see, your job is just to describe

09:01.120 --> 09:02.963
the play in five sentences or less

09:03.040 --> 09:04.883
and make it sound interesting.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.121
Perhaps you weren't aware

09:06.200 --> 09:08.931
that I won the Hollingsworth
fellowship for playwriting

09:09.000 --> 09:10.365
or that New York Magazine put me

09:10.440 --> 09:11.680
on their list of playwrights to watch?

09:12.320 --> 09:16.245
I was not aware. Thank you for
bringing that to my attention.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.367
You're welcome.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.847
Okay.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.368
Well, we certainly
don't want to stand in

09:21.440 --> 09:23.329
the way of your burgeoning
writing career.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.801
So, uh...

09:26.520 --> 09:27.521
Yeah.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.641
What does "yeah" mean?

09:30.400 --> 09:31.401
Yeah.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.921
You can go.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.287
This is Peter.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.283
I know I'm not
supposed to call you during work hours,

09:47.360 --> 09:50.842
but I lost my job at the magazine.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.045
And I'm just...

09:53.120 --> 09:55.122
<i>I'm having a really
tough time right now.</i>

09:55.240 --> 09:58.084
And I know it's not your problem, but...

09:58.200 --> 09:59.770
I was just thinking maybe

09:59.840 --> 10:01.922
you could come over
and just lay with me for a little bit?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.764
Imogene, I...

10:03.840 --> 10:05.490
<i>- I'm working.
- I know, I just...</i>

10:05.560 --> 10:08.723
I don't really
trust myself to be alone right now.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.280
What? What do you mean?

10:11.360 --> 10:15.809
I mean I'm afraid
if you don't come over I might

10:16.720 --> 10:18.802
do something to myself.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.961
<i>Imogene.</i>

10:20.040 --> 10:21.804
<i>Or maybe I already have.</i>

10:21.880 --> 10:22.881
What did you do?

10:22.960 --> 10:24.166
Just, Peter...

10:24.240 --> 10:26.288
If you love me just say
you'll come over. Please?

10:26.360 --> 10:27.725
All right.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.041
<i>Farewell, world.</i>

10:36.600 --> 10:39.604
<i>My life is but
a brief flickering in the darkness.</i>

10:39.720 --> 10:41.324
<i>Too faint to light a room.</i>

10:41.400 --> 10:44.006
<i>And much too soon does
the flame burn out.</i>

10:44.120 --> 10:47.203
<i>As the winds of suffering
have extinguished my light,</i>

10:47.280 --> 10:50.727
<i>heaven welcomes me
with her open embrace.</i>

11:19.280 --> 11:20.805
Imogene?

11:22.200 --> 11:23.531
Hello?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.009
Are you in here?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.440
Imogene, you left your door open.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.602
There's also a sign on it.
I think your landlord is upset with you.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.329
Imogene, I just stopped by to pick up

11:38.400 --> 11:40.971
those Cartier earrings that I lent you.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.649
Imogene.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.645
Oh, my God.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.563
Hello? Imogene?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.642
Imogene, can you hear me?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.489
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.246
Oh, my God!

12:03.240 --> 12:04.571
Oh, my God!

12:05.520 --> 12:06.760
Oh, my God, Imogene.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.562
Hello. Dad?

12:11.360 --> 12:13.089
Daddy, it's Dara.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.491
Oh, my God, Dad.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.209
Imogene is dead!

12:20.480 --> 12:22.482
No, no. She's just dead.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.322
I don't know how to check!

12:30.600 --> 12:32.011
Imogene.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.685
Imogene.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.365
Oh, my gosh!

12:53.520 --> 12:54.851
Cheers.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.202
<i>And the Tony Award for
Best Play goes to...</i>

13:12.040 --> 13:13.769
<i>Imogene Duncan!</i>

13:17.560 --> 13:18.686
I'm such a fan!

13:18.760 --> 13:19.966
No. I'm such a fan.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.405
Thank you.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.647
<i>Oh, thank you so much. Oh, my gosh!</i>

13:25.720 --> 13:28.200
<i>There's so many people
that I want to thank.</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:33.207
<i>But most importantly,
my wonderful, Dutch husband, Peter.</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:36.443
<i>I will love you forever.
Or should I say...</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:45.287
For the 10 millionth time,

13:45.360 --> 13:46.600
I wasn't really trying to kill myself.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.008
So, you're saying you
didn't really want to be reunited

13:50.080 --> 13:51.491
with your dead father for eternity?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.409
I didn't want to die, okay?

13:53.520 --> 13:55.045
Well, I think the problem
you're facing here

13:55.120 --> 13:57.691
is that you wrote a pretty
authentic sounding letter.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.125
Really?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.207
You thought it was that good?

14:01.280 --> 14:04.170
Now in your letter,
you refer to your dead father.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.089
How old were you when he passed away?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.367
Nine. Seriously, there
is no point to this.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.601
Can you tell me about him?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.921
He was just the best.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.769
The smartest man I ever met.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.489
He was like the George
Clooney of fathers.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.801
And what about the rest of your family?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.527
Uh... My mom
lives in New Jersey with my brother.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.602
She has an impulse control problem,

14:25.680 --> 14:26.761
and I haven't seen them in years.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.526
Can you describe the symptoms
of your mother's impulse problem?

14:30.640 --> 14:31.880
Uh, let's see.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.247
Buying 52 pairs of jelly
shoes in one year.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.210
Gambling every day.
Picking up hitchhikers.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.409
Showing up to a parent-teacher
conference wearing a turban.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.721
My brother and I,
our birthdays are 84 days apart,

14:42.800 --> 14:43.961
and because of her gambling

14:44.040 --> 14:45.929
she couldn't afford to give us
individual birthday parties,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.128
so we had to have a
combined birthday party.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.890
Do you have any idea
how it feels to have a birthday party

14:49.960 --> 14:51.769
eighty-four days after
your actual birthday,

14:51.840 --> 14:53.763
because your mom has an impulse problem?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.171
Okay, well, it doesn't feel very good.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.561
No, it's very sad.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.801
Yeah.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.166
I'm doing okay.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.969
I mean, it's been
upsetting for me, but...

15:02.040 --> 15:04.247
Have you ever received
a telephone call

15:04.320 --> 15:05.924
of an urgent nature when you're naked?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.082
- I haven't.
- I had just gotten out of the shower.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.764
And suddenly this call comes.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.081
Well, we tracked down your information

15:12.160 --> 15:15.084
from old DMV records, Mrs. Duncan.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.243
Are you familiar with a 5150 hold?

15:18.520 --> 15:22.605
Uh... Yes, but I'm sure I
paid those tickets. Okay?

15:22.680 --> 15:26.366
And the judge ruled that the
second one wasn't even my fault.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.091
This has nothing to do
with your driving record, Mrs. Duncan.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.607
A 5150 means that
it is our duty to hold anyone

15:32.680 --> 15:35.445
who poses a threat to themselves
for at least 72 hours.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.091
However, we have
a bit of an overcrowding problem,

15:38.160 --> 15:41.209
which limits us to holding
only critical patients

15:41.280 --> 15:43.965
and releasing the others,
like your daughter,

15:44.040 --> 15:45.405
into the care of a loved one.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.044
- She said she loved me?
- No.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.441
But we have more
critical patients that need her bed.

15:50.520 --> 15:55.082
You mean people that, like,
jump out of buildings and cut parts off?

15:55.880 --> 15:57.120
That kind of stuff?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.804
Sometimes.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.884
Can I ask you a question?
Does that make you really sad?

16:02.680 --> 16:05.843
Uh, Mrs. Duncan, would you be
willing to assume responsibility

16:05.920 --> 16:10.403
<i>for the safety and well-being
of your daughter for the next 72 hours?</i>

16:11.040 --> 16:13.646
Well, I have to be somewhere later.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.200
But, yes. Of course.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.964
Did I tell you that Gwyneth Paltrow

16:18.080 --> 16:19.161
might come to my book launch party?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.720
- Wow! What a coup.
- I know!

16:21.800 --> 16:24.451
It's like my dad's PR
guy knows everyone.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.401
Oh.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.764
I will be back in one second,
I have to take this.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.086
Hi.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.286
It's an upsetting night.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.441
Hello.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.763
Imogene, listen,
I know you're expecting your boyfriend,

16:40.840 --> 16:43.002
and we've made several
attempts to try and...

16:43.080 --> 16:45.526
Peter is coming for me, okay?

16:46.120 --> 16:47.884
Yes, I'm sure Peter cares
for you very deeply,

16:47.960 --> 16:50.770
but both your mother
and I feel that the best thing

16:50.840 --> 16:51.841
for you right now...

16:51.920 --> 16:53.081
Wait. Did you just say "mother"?

16:53.240 --> 16:56.767
...would be for you to be
in the comfort and safety

16:56.840 --> 16:59.446
of those who love you unconditionally.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.761
So your mother is
going to take you home with her.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.401
Hi, honey.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.970
You cannot do this.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.328
Dara! Dara!
Tell them you love me unconditionally.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.961
What?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.290
I can't go with her!
Please! Please!

17:12.800 --> 17:16.042
Dara! Tell them I can stay
with you until Peter comes for me!

17:16.119 --> 17:17.121
Oh, my gosh, I wish that I could help,

17:17.200 --> 17:19.521
but I don't think that we can
accommodate house-guests right now.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.607
What?

17:20.680 --> 17:22.409
- You can't do this to me!
- Hold her!

17:22.520 --> 17:23.964
Dara! Call the police!

17:24.480 --> 17:26.721
Imogene, this is going
to make your trip home

17:26.800 --> 17:29.121
just a little bit more relaxing.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.131
Honey...

17:38.560 --> 17:40.164
Your panties are showing.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.531
Mom?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.370
Step right up, everybody!

18:40.880 --> 18:42.211
Clear the path.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.924
Bring me a joker.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.211
- Feeling good!
- Hey!

18:47.680 --> 18:49.569
- Oh!
- What the hell are you doing?

18:49.640 --> 18:52.166
Jesus, don't sneak up on me like that.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.402
You left me in the
back seat of your car!

18:54.480 --> 18:58.451
Well, honey, they told me that you were gonna
be out for, like, you know, six hours.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.568
You took me against my will!

19:00.640 --> 19:02.244
You know, I could have you
arrested for kidnapping.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.891
Imogene, they called
me from the hospital.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.724
They said that you had
tried to kill yourself

19:06.800 --> 19:08.802
and they were
gonna lock you up with schizophrenians.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.087
I mean, you know, what was I supposed to do?
Leave you there?

19:11.160 --> 19:14.687
Oh, and this is better?
Waking up alone in a casino parking lot?

19:14.760 --> 19:16.330
I don't have my purse, no cell phone.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.970
I have no wallet. No ID. Nothing.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.530
Zelda, is this lady giving you grief?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.841
Oh, no. Delancey, this is my daughter.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.161
<i>Do you know that she was
on the New York Times list</i>

19:24.240 --> 19:25.287
of playwrights to watch...

19:25.360 --> 19:27.010
It was New York Magazine!

19:27.080 --> 19:28.764
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.491
I've seen your mother here
get more royal flushes than anybody.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.561
That's great.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.041
Okay.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.122
Round and round she goes!

20:12.320 --> 20:13.810
You think I don't know why you did it?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.689
I'm your mother, okay.
I know why you did it.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.961
Some men are stayers.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.531
Some men are leavers, and you know,
it's better to find out now.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.602
Wow, where did you get
that pearl of wisdom?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.569
<i>It was on The Joy Behar Show.</i>

20:26.880 --> 20:30.805
You know, the doctor let me read your letter.
I thought it was really good.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.046
Really.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.363
Apparently, I should be a
professional suicide writer.

20:35.560 --> 20:39.451
Oh, you're not writing
plays anymore, huh?

20:39.520 --> 20:42.205
I am not talking about this.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.481
Hey-

20:55.600 --> 20:57.090
Where'd you go?

20:58.160 --> 20:59.764
Imogene?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.805
Ew! Hello? Hi!
Who are you?

21:04.040 --> 21:06.646
Um... I'm Lee.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.881
Who's she?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.530
Lee, what are you doing in my room?

21:09.600 --> 21:11.443
Actually, this is my room.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.601
Since when?

21:12.680 --> 21:15.365
Uh, since Zelda started
renting it to me.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.771
- What?
- Imogene?

21:18.200 --> 21:19.611
- Ralph!
- Imogene, you're back!

21:19.680 --> 21:20.727
Oh, my God.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.047
You're really back! You're here!

21:23.120 --> 21:26.124
Wow, you look so different.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.202
I've been eating a lot of spaghetti.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.885
- Oh.
- So you're going to spend the night?

21:29.960 --> 21:31.325
No, I'm not... No.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.970
Why did Mom rent out my room?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.485
Her settlement money ran out.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.686
What settlement money?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.125
An escalator ate her
jelly shoe at the Oasis

21:37.200 --> 21:38.690
and screwed up her toe.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.125
Can I have a second hug?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.326
This is really weird.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.561
Monica, wait a second.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.404
It's fine, she's...

21:48.240 --> 21:49.730
Mom!

21:51.440 --> 21:52.646
Hello.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.361
Okay, before you start getting
all creepy, let me explain.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.922
How can you rationalize
renting my room out to some random guy?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.843
Well, you haven't been
back in a long time!

22:01.920 --> 22:03.046
Yeah. She does have a point.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.122
Where is all my stuff?
What, did you throw out all my stuff?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.123
Calm down. It's in the basement.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.680
So what now? What, do
I sleep with you now?

22:09.760 --> 22:12.366
Oh. Well, I don't think
that's going to work either.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.363
- Why not?
- The Bousche sleeps in her bed.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.566
The what?

22:15.640 --> 22:18.723
Hey, I could make you a sheet
fort like when we were kids?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.531
Can you come out here a second?

22:20.600 --> 22:21.886
Yeah.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.481
Yeah?

22:23.560 --> 22:24.561
Okay.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.522
Imogene, this is my boyfriend.
He lives with us.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.602
He's in the CIA.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.242
Hi. George Bousche.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.687
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.410
George.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.482
Your name is George Bousche?

22:42.480 --> 22:46.007
Well, as a matter of
fact, it's not my name.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.608
You see, my father was an assassin,

22:49.720 --> 22:52.803
and he had to change
all of our birth names

22:52.880 --> 22:57.522
because of that incident
I told you about, about the KGB.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.768
So what is your real name then?

23:02.840 --> 23:05.684
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.171
- Even I don't know.
- No.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.847
Okay.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.242
- No one knows. Okay.
- Yeah.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.890
Okay.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.611
You gonna put on
something nice, honey?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.605
So, did Mom tell you the good news?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.090
Who's it good for?

24:41.240 --> 24:42.765
I got my own kiosk,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.444
one block from the boardwalk.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.001
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.845
Right across from Angela's Pizza.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.570
Well, where it used to be. Here.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.766
Oh.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.330
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.120
- Congratulations!
- Yep.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.770
No, no. Please keep it.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.285
Or, you know, give it to a friend.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.840
Anyone you refer gets a free hermit hut.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.251
That's a good deal.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.809
Do you want to come and see it?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.126
Oh.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.889
I wish I could.
But, you know, I have to go back home.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.325
Yeah, to the city.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.084
You know, you really
should come visit me.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.090
We could go to the Natural History
Museum and the Aquarium.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.083
Yeah, it's far away.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.242
Yeah. Well, maybe that's a good thing.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.721
I like being in Ocean City.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.131
You used to like it, too.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.283
Yeah. I just think
that New York is a better place for me.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.569
Mmm. Okay.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.167
Well, this is your basic
sheet fort model.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.441
Um...

25:39.680 --> 25:44.686
If you would like any add-ons
or security features,

25:44.760 --> 25:46.285
I mean, I can work on it tomorrow.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.601
No, it looks very secure.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.727
Yeah?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.245
Yeah, you did a great job.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.522
Um, all right, well.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.362
Nighty-night, Imogene.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.168
Breakfast, everybody!

26:35.480 --> 26:37.050
- Oh, Jesus!
- Ow! God! Someone's in here!

26:37.120 --> 26:38.406
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!

26:38.480 --> 26:39.925
God!

26:41.760 --> 26:42.966
Hey, I'm really sorry about that.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.084
Your brother likes us to keep the door
closed because the toilet runs.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.731
I didn't see anything, just so you know.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.210
Okay. Well,
you should really knock as a precaution.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.361
I guess we're even then.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.124
Oh, so it's my fault that I walk in

26:55.200 --> 26:56.690
on you doing it with your girlfriend?

26:56.800 --> 26:58.802
Because, hello, this is my house.

26:58.880 --> 26:59.961
But you don't live here anymore.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.725
I grew up in this house.
I think that takes precedence over

27:02.800 --> 27:06.407
whatever temporary
whatever you're doing here.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.806
What are you doing here?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.166
Excuse me?

27:09.440 --> 27:10.487
What...

27:10.560 --> 27:11.686
Why did you come back?

27:11.760 --> 27:14.001
I really don't see
how that is any of your concern, Lee.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.289
Look, if you want to stay in the
room, it really is no trouble.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.521
I'll be happy to stay somewhere else.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.001
Oh, I'm sure you can.
But, see, I like to make a special point

27:21.080 --> 27:22.889
to not sleep in the bed of boys

27:22.960 --> 27:24.724
whose cleanliness of
sheets is questionable

27:24.800 --> 27:25.847
at best.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.609
- This morning.
- What?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.762
That's when I changed my sheets.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.447
Hey-

27:42.400 --> 27:46.769
Um, I don't really know how to
broach this subject tactfully,

27:47.720 --> 27:48.881
so I'm just going to say it.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.961
Ralph, cover your ears.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.368
Were you getting spanked last night?

27:57.680 --> 27:59.091
Why would you think that?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.003
Because that's what it sounded like.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.370
- Am I right?
- Oh, my God.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.841
No. I'm right, aren't I? Ugh!

28:07.920 --> 28:10.651
Imogene, it is so much fun.
Have you never tried it?

28:10.720 --> 28:13.405
Yeah, maybe, like, two or three times
in the heat of passion, I don't know.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.084
But not in repetition
for, like, two hours.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.845
Oh, my God.
If it was bothering you so much

28:17.920 --> 28:19.206
you should have just closed your door.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.611
Oh, my sheet door?

28:21.960 --> 28:23.530
You know, you should be grateful I have

28:23.600 --> 28:25.489
such an amazing sex life with George.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.803
Or would you rather I turned
into one of those dried up women

28:28.880 --> 28:32.282
like Mitzi Mordler who spends all
her time with her little rat dog.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.646
Yeah. That.
Mitzi, that's what I want.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.485
Oh, God.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.641
Coffee ready?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.609
Over there, Bubba.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.970
I need it after last night.

28:46.840 --> 28:47.966
You know, if Dad were alive

28:48.080 --> 28:49.650
to see what you've become,
he would be disgraced.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.561
He died?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.287
When did that happen?

28:56.480 --> 28:58.289
No, no, no. It's nothing.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.566
What?

28:59.640 --> 29:02.803
I mean, yes. He died.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.121
A long time ago. He's been dead.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.968
- You know that.
- Right.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.284
- Can I take them off now?
- Yeah.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.526
Sorry.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.651
Why would you say that?

29:25.720 --> 29:26.846
I thought you told them.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.247
No! You knew they didn't know.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.441
No?

29:29.520 --> 29:31.443
Something like that
could ruin their lives.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.887
You can never, ever let them know
about their father really being...

29:34.000 --> 29:35.331
Being what?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.601
Cheap.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.966
Dad was cheap?

29:41.560 --> 29:43.608
Oh, God, yeah.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.683
Don't you remember that ugly
couch we had in the living room?

29:47.760 --> 29:49.125
He wouldn't let me buy the one I wanted,

29:49.200 --> 29:52.090
so we had to get that
one from a garage sale.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.009
You're lying. I can see it!
I can see it in your eyes.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.809
Tell us the truth.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.601
Was Dad not our father?

29:58.680 --> 30:02.765
No, no, no. He was. He is your father.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.649
- What do you mean "he is our father"?
- No.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.043
- Oh, God.
- Mom?

30:08.160 --> 30:12.085
I can't. You know, I can't.
I can't do this anymore.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.969
- Breathe.
Oh, God.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.081
What?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.761
All right.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.526
We didn't get along, okay?

30:23.400 --> 30:25.528
And he wanted to
go back to school for his PhD.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.523
And we agreed that we didn't want
to put you through a divorce

30:27.600 --> 30:29.568
and all of the custody hell,

30:29.680 --> 30:31.887
and so we decided
that you guys would stay with me

30:31.960 --> 30:33.007
and I would just tell you that...

30:33.080 --> 30:34.809
What?

30:35.800 --> 30:37.768
That he died.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.447
I can't believe this.
What, Dad is alive?

30:44.520 --> 30:45.806
Yeah.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.441
What mother tells their
children that their father died

30:49.520 --> 30:51.488
during a routine colonoscopy, to what?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.370
To save them from inconvenience?

30:54.440 --> 30:57.205
No, no, it was
a complicated situation, Imogene. Okay?

30:57.280 --> 30:59.851
I was trying
to protect you guys.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.770
I wanted you to
grow up feeling good about yourselves.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.370
What happened to him?

31:04.440 --> 31:06.329
Somebody told me that he wrote a book.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.446
Oh, wait, Imogene.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.966
Wait. Oh, come on.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.529
What are you going to do?

31:16.600 --> 31:17.806
Wait!

31:17.880 --> 31:19.211
Imogene.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.045
Immy, wait.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.170
Ralph, was that boat
moored out there yesterday?

31:27.280 --> 31:29.009
Imogene, please.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.406
Imogene, honey. I need my car today.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.847
I have a free spin on the Lucky Wheel!

31:34.920 --> 31:37.321
Hey, wait. Honey, please.
Hey, unlock the door, okay?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.848
The jackpot is a cruise to Jamaica!
We could all go together!

31:42.320 --> 31:43.481
Hey...

31:44.760 --> 31:48.128
Honey, please don't kill
yourself over this.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.485
I love you.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.280
Oh, can I help you?

32:00.360 --> 32:01.600
I hope so.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.444
Um, do you have anything written
by Maxwell P. Duncan?

32:03.520 --> 32:05.648
P. Duncan.
Let's look it up.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.360
That's a "C", right?

32:07.440 --> 32:08.487
That's a

32:08.560 --> 32:09.607
And not a

32:09.680 --> 32:10.761
- No, it's a
- Oh.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.285
No, sorry. You just pressed

32:12.360 --> 32:13.486
You're right. Sorry about that.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.244
- Okay.
- D-U-N.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.126
Oh, there's lots of Duncans.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.725
P. Duncan. Maxwell P. Duncan.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.609
Are you okay?

32:20.680 --> 32:22.045
Yes. Thank you.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.124
P. Duncan, there it is.
We have one book.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.130
Uh, let's see.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.566
Where is it?

32:30.640 --> 32:31.926
In the non-fiction.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.686
Hmm.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.603
"Maxwell P. Duncan
is a world-renowned expert

32:54.680 --> 32:57.524
"on the early colonial period
of American history.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.967
"Mr. Duncan has spoken on PBS and NPR.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.366
"He resides in...

33:02.760 --> 33:04.524
"New York City."

33:37.080 --> 33:38.605
Oh, no, you don't.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.249
Move it!

34:09.719 --> 34:11.051
I saw you in my rearview mirror,

34:11.120 --> 34:12.201
you weren't even paying attention!

34:12.320 --> 34:13.400
You were putting on makeup!

34:13.480 --> 34:16.051
I wasn't putting on makeup! Does it
look like I'm wearing makeup to you?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.246
Well, you're going to
have to pay for this.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.800
It's a couple of little scratches.
What is the big deal?

34:19.880 --> 34:22.167
Excuse me, it's a Porsche!

34:22.239 --> 34:23.889
Sir, it's a Boxster.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.928
You folks okay? You're
holding up traffic.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.485
No, sir. We're not okay,
actually, at all.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.166
This woman rear-ends me
while she's putting on makeup.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.764
My visor fell down!

34:32.880 --> 34:34.609
Can you both please show me
your driver's license,

34:34.679 --> 34:36.170
registration, and insurance cards?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.810
Sure thing, Officer.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.686
Is something wrong?

34:41.760 --> 34:43.170
Okay. First of all, I
wasn't putting on makeup!

34:43.239 --> 34:44.241
Ocean City?

34:44.320 --> 34:46.129
Imogene?

34:46.199 --> 34:47.690
Imogene Duncan?

34:47.760 --> 34:48.886
Yeah.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.405
It's me. It's Rex Rinaldi.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.161
From high school.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.685
T-Rex Rinaldi?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.922
You were my TA in my
dumb-bell math class.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.684
You said you couldn't go
to homecoming with me

34:59.800 --> 35:02.929
because it fell on the anniversary
of your father's death?

35:03.560 --> 35:04.766
- Yeah.
- Sure!

35:04.840 --> 35:05.841
Okay, yeah.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.126
Imogene Duncan!

35:07.200 --> 35:08.281
Here I am.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.526
Can we do this please?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.170
- I have somewhere I'm supposed to be.
- Yeah. All right.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.571
Great, thank you.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.001
Do you have yours?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.648
You know, I live in Manhattan now,

35:19.760 --> 35:21.728
and I haven't really driven in years.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.087
Dispatch, I got to run a plate.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.046
Uh, New Jersey.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.726
- Umbrella-zero-alpha-eight-niner.
- Hey, Rex?

35:29.400 --> 35:34.964
I just want to say how brave and
selfless you are for what you do.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.201
Just all the citizens...

35:36.320 --> 35:37.481
Copy that.

35:37.720 --> 35:42.601
Uh, well, uh, it seems this car
has been reported as stolen.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.250
Oh, what is this?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.810
- What is this?
- Sir, I'm going to have to ask you

35:45.880 --> 35:47.803
to please keep your
comments to yourself.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.689
No, no, no, there's been a mistake.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.127
There's been a mistake.
This is my mother's car.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.410
Okay? And she lent it to me
to go visit my father.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.845
So it's not stolen.

35:57.920 --> 35:58.921
Right.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.331
That's wrong.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.450
I thought your father died?

36:03.440 --> 36:06.410
No, he did.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.562
I just found out today. I thought he...

36:09.200 --> 36:10.406
He has not died.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.522
<i>on, I get it.</i>

36:12.600 --> 36:14.568
He's alive when you need him to be.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.847
And then he's dead
when you have to blow someone off.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.366
No,no,no,no!
My mother told me that he died.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.205
And then, now I found
out that he's alive.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.327
Crock of shit!

36:23.400 --> 36:25.846
And I bet that if I asked
you out for a beer

36:25.920 --> 36:27.843
he'd probably die again, right?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.321
Well, obviously,
I hope that wouldn't be the case.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.131
But, given the fact that I don't
know what kind of health he's in,

36:33.200 --> 36:36.124
I mean that certainly
could be a possibility.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.449
- Duncan.
- What?

36:42.520 --> 36:43.601
You're out.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.886
Your mom dropped the charges.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.807
Oh, uh, good luck at Nationals.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.204
<i>You hit someone in a Porsche?</i>

36:56.280 --> 36:58.567
Quit changing the subject.
You had me arrested!

36:58.640 --> 37:01.564
Come on, honey.
it was for your own good, okay?

37:01.640 --> 37:04.041
I knew how upset you were, and when
you didn't come back for a while,

37:04.120 --> 37:06.521
I was afraid you
were going to stop on the train tracks.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.728
You know, George told me the
best way to find someone

37:08.800 --> 37:10.245
is accuse them of a crime.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.288
That's how they do it in the CIA.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.362
How was jail, Imogene?

37:14.440 --> 37:15.771
Disappointing.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.290
I know you think I
screwed up your life,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.727
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe having a dead father

37:25.800 --> 37:27.928
was better for you than
having a dead-beat one?

37:28.000 --> 37:29.365
Dead-beat?

37:29.440 --> 37:31.010
The man lives in New York City.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.684
He's a world-renowned expert

37:32.760 --> 37:34.285
on the early colonial period
of American history.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.931
- What?
- He's spoken in 29 countries.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.889
He's been interviewed on NPR and PBS.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.325
Okay. Maybe he's found some success.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.447
Some success?

37:41.520 --> 37:42.726
But that doesn't change
who he is as a person.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.325
- Is that Dad's book?
- Yes.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.526
<i>It's called The Myth of Thanksgiving.</i>

37:45.600 --> 37:47.648
- It's actually our father's second book.
- Thanksgiving is a myth?

37:47.720 --> 37:48.881
- What?
- Yeah, amongst other things.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.445
Oh, get out of here.
Your father wrote a book

37:50.520 --> 37:52.090
on how Thanksgiving never happened?

37:52.160 --> 37:54.811
Yeah. You know,
we embrace it as this national holiday,

37:54.880 --> 37:56.803
but actually it was a
political spin job.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.684
Did it say who invented pumpkin pie?

37:58.760 --> 38:00.410
Don't laugh. No, it didn't say
who invented pumpkin pie.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.403
You know, I'm sorry,
but I'm not surprised.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.642
He always wanted
to ruin everything that was fun.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.603
Oh, yeah, Dad tried to ruin everything.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.883
Dad's only, like,
a very brilliant, accomplished man,

38:09.960 --> 38:11.405
who, you know what,
after we get reunited,

38:11.480 --> 38:12.970
is going to help me get on my feet

38:13.040 --> 38:14.451
and who is going to cherish me,

38:14.560 --> 38:17.040
and make up for the years of humiliation

38:17.120 --> 38:18.645
that I endured being your daughter.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.802
Oh, my God. Well, do
you have his address?

38:20.880 --> 38:22.609
No. I... What? No.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.887
But I'm gonna get it. And then
when I get it I'm gonna go there.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.121
And Ralph's going to come with me.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.401
Oh, no, I don't go past the boardwalk.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.847
You know, Imogene, a lot of people
had a worse mother than you.

38:29.920 --> 38:30.921
Like me.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.526
And one day when you're old,
you're gonna look back and realize that.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.648
When I'm old. And
hopefully, I can also die

38:35.720 --> 38:37.688
84 days around when Ralph dies,

38:37.760 --> 38:39.683
so we can combine our funerals.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.565
Hey, honey. Honey, come here.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.801
- Get over here.
- What?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.530
I have to tell you something.

39:02.600 --> 39:03.965
Are you guys coming?

39:04.040 --> 39:06.008
Uh, you just go on in. Turn on the TV.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.686
Okay, honey? We'll be there in a sec.

39:08.760 --> 39:12.526
Look. I know you got mad when I made
you do your birthday with Ralph.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.206
No. I actually loved combining birthday
parties with Ralph. Really.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.520
It's one of my fondest memories.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.329
Well, I had to do that, okay?

39:18.400 --> 39:19.686
I had to put your parties together,

39:19.760 --> 39:22.684
or else Ralph would
have had no one at his.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.762
Your friends were humans.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.850
His friends were lizards
or crabs or whatever.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.611
We all had to make sacrifices for Ralph.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.411
Good night.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.890
Ralph!

40:08.760 --> 40:10.171
Uh, Eugenia.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.890
You got a minute for the Bousche?

40:12.520 --> 40:13.726
It's Imogene.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.043
Listen, I've been meaning to
talk to you because I'm worried.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.168
You shouldn't be mad at your mother.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.130
Really? And what
exactly qualifies you to say that to me,

40:22.200 --> 40:25.647
considering I've
known you for what, 40 hours?

40:26.480 --> 40:29.563
Because she's been through
a very hard time.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.642
- And she loves you.
- No. Of course she does.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.610
That's why
she had me arrested for stealing her car

40:34.680 --> 40:36.170
and lied to me about my father.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.561
Sometimes information needs
to be kept classified.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.883
Okay, look, no offense, but this is
really between me and my family.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.731
I am part of your family now.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.129
Now, I may look a little
young for the gig,

40:48.200 --> 40:49.929
but in the samurai tradition,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.445
when a man loves a woman,

40:51.520 --> 40:55.286
he automatically becomes
a spiritual guardian for her offspring.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.921
So, what, you're a samurai now, too?

40:59.000 --> 41:02.686
Oh, I've been a samurai for 25 years.
You didn't know that?

41:02.760 --> 41:05.923
No. I didn't. 25, wow.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.048
- That's a long time.
- Yeah.

41:08.120 --> 41:12.284
But thank you,
I think me and my spirit are just fine.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.567
Are you sure about that?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.165
That's not what I'm getting.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.322
I'm getting resistance.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.526
Yeah. Little bit.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.890
That's accurate.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.488
What's the password?

41:30.440 --> 41:32.283
Spuds McKenzie?

41:34.800 --> 41:37.280
Spuds McKenzie.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.806
You may enter.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.610
WOW!

41:46.840 --> 41:48.410
Oh, wow, your room...

41:52.040 --> 41:53.121
Um...

41:54.640 --> 41:57.883
Oh, this was so sweet of you,
but I think I should give this back.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.041
Why don't you want her?

41:59.920 --> 42:01.888
I kind of got a lot going on right now.

42:01.960 --> 42:04.122
I don't really think I'd be
a very good crab mom.

42:04.640 --> 42:08.201
Well, then maybe you could
be her crab buddy.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.931
Um... Yeah. I don't think
I'd be a very good crab buddy either.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.086
Plus I think she misses you. See.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.406
Mmm-hmm.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.085
Hey, Ralph.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.564
Do you have any money
you think you can loan me?

42:28.640 --> 42:29.846
What for?

42:29.920 --> 42:33.402
So I can go back to New York.
And pay my landlord.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.642
And try to find Dad.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.411
You do want me to find Dad, don't you?

42:41.920 --> 42:44.127
Don't you think it would be cool if

42:44.200 --> 42:47.647
no matter where you were in the world,
you were already home?

42:48.440 --> 42:52.161
Or precisely, that you were just as
safe as you are in your own home,

42:52.240 --> 42:54.925
even when you're not there?

42:55.840 --> 42:59.162
Uh, yeah. Sure, yeah. I guess so.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.561
Um...

43:00.680 --> 43:01.761
Here, sit down.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.171
- Huh? Oh.
- Sit down.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.925
Since the dawn of time,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.321
soft-bellied creatures have been jealous

43:08.480 --> 43:11.848
of mollusks' ability to self-preserve.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.729
But they don't have to be anymore.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.481
I made this.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.246
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:33.320 --> 43:37.006
It has all the amenities
of a typical mollusk's home,

43:37.080 --> 43:39.970
but this one is made of top-grade,
bullet-proof fiberglass,

43:40.040 --> 43:43.010
and I've coated it with
Cyber-Flexx plastic.

43:43.080 --> 43:46.243
It's comfortable enough
for extended use,

43:46.320 --> 43:49.847
and it even has wireless
Internet capability.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.967
What?

43:51.040 --> 43:52.201
I call it "The Human Shell."

43:55.800 --> 43:57.131
Wow.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.089
- May I?
- Yeah, you can touch.

44:00.360 --> 44:01.327
What's it for?

44:01.400 --> 44:03.528
You put it on your back.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.080
And then if you ever need protection

44:06.160 --> 44:08.561
or you want to hide or whatever,

44:08.640 --> 44:11.883
you just pull it down on yourself.

44:12.800 --> 44:13.801
Oh.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.241
Ralph?

44:28.920 --> 44:31.400
Hey, Lee! Hey, wait.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.801
Hey-

44:33.880 --> 44:36.770
Wait! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait!

44:40.880 --> 44:42.530
Take me to New York.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.041
No.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.241
Why?

44:46.320 --> 44:48.607
Because I have things to do.

44:49.200 --> 44:52.249
Fine. Fine. Then I will stay
here and I will kill myself

44:52.320 --> 44:53.481
and it'll be all your fault.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.961
And I will specifically
mention your name in the letter,

44:56.040 --> 44:57.371
which, apparently, I am
very good at writing.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.523
Wow. You're really
gonna show me, aren't you? Jeez.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.165
All right, I'll tell you what.

45:12.680 --> 45:13.727
Here.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.804
- Why are you giving me a quarter?
- Just call it.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.491
My sanity hangs in the balance,

45:18.560 --> 45:20.801
and this is how you're deciding if
you're gonna take me or not?

45:20.880 --> 45:22.325
Yeah. Do you want me call it
or should you call it?

45:22.400 --> 45:23.401
- What's it going to be?
- Tails.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.891
Tails. All right.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.801
Here's hoping.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.521
Oh.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.767
You know what? Forget it.

45:29.840 --> 45:33.640
Just forget it. I don't need this from
some, like, happy-go-lucky simpleton...

45:33.720 --> 45:34.721
"Happy-go-lucky"?

45:34.800 --> 45:36.928
...who thinks
it's really funny to taunt someone

45:37.000 --> 45:39.162
who's on the brink of
a mental breakdown,

45:39.240 --> 45:40.924
who is literally reeling
from the shock of her life!

45:41.000 --> 45:43.321
Will you relax? Just relax.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.447
It's tails.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.851
Okay?

45:48.520 --> 45:50.090
You're going to New York.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.965
I'm sorry I called you
a simpleton before.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.129
What about happy-go-lucky?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.566
Yeah. That, too, I guess.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.610
And thanks for doing this for me.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.808
I'm actually doing this for myself.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.764
Because now I can ask you to do, like,
anything and you have to do it.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.963
Okay, well, I'm not planning on
ever seeing you again after today

46:25.040 --> 46:26.280
ever in my life, so, great.

46:27.720 --> 46:28.960
Sounds like a plan.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.370
Okay. So, what's your story?

46:36.480 --> 46:38.323
My story? Um...

46:38.440 --> 46:42.729
Well, I grew up in Pennsylvania.
Went to college when I was 17.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.404
Where?

46:44.480 --> 46:46.084
Uh, Yale.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.926
You did not go to Yale.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.161
Okay.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.924
I didn't go to Yale.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.401
Um...

46:53.120 --> 46:57.250
Then I moved to Philly
and sang in a shitty band.

46:57.320 --> 46:59.322
Bussed tables for a while.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.289
And then this guy I knew

47:01.360 --> 47:04.603
had an audition
to be in a show at the Oasis Casino.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.967
I went with him, and the
next thing you know,

47:07.040 --> 47:08.405
I got the job.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.001
Does he hate you?

47:10.080 --> 47:12.162
No. I don't think he hates me.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.366
I would hate you.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.523
Yeah, but you hate everybody.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.168
So, what's your story?

47:24.360 --> 47:26.328
Have you ever heard of
Douglas J. Hollingsworth?

47:27.560 --> 47:30.291
Well, every year
he awards someone a $30,000 grant

47:30.360 --> 47:32.283
to write a play that he will produce.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.011
And in 2004 he picked me.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.682
And my whole world opened up.

47:39.320 --> 47:41.049
I met Dara, who was on the board.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.202
She introduced me to my boyfriend,

47:43.280 --> 47:45.362
and it just felt like
everything was starting.

47:47.240 --> 47:50.403
But when I actually sat down to write,
nothing good came out.

47:50.480 --> 47:55.486
So I just went shopping with my friends
and went on vacations.

47:56.120 --> 47:59.567
And when the year was up,
I didn't have a play to produce.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.927
So why don't you just
finish something now?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.729
Because nobody cares now.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.245
It's over.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.610
You know, you're lucky
you're back in New York.

48:19.680 --> 48:23.048
I was going to force you to come
see my show tomorrow as payback.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.600
Sorry, but I am never
crossing the Hudson again.

48:25.680 --> 48:29.127
Come on, do you really think New
York is that much better?

48:29.200 --> 48:32.522
Yeah. You kidding?
Come on, New York has everything.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.883
Central Park, when it snows.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.041
Okay, yeah.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.804
Bergdorf's.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.771
Everyone here dresses so beautifully,
and they're intelligent.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.729
It's like they have
this swagger of, like,

48:44.800 --> 48:46.928
<i>"I finished the New York Times
crossword puzzle in pen."</i>

48:48.560 --> 48:49.686
Huh.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.641
Wow, okay.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.529
Not all of them, but...

48:55.200 --> 48:57.407
Hey, Joe, can I get a spare key?

48:57.480 --> 48:58.720
I lost mine.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.610
Uh, Miss Duncan, I can't.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.842
I'm afraid I can't let you up there.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.041
What do you mean? What's going on?

49:04.800 --> 49:06.131
You should talk to Mr. Bill.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.407
What?

49:07.480 --> 49:10.927
Joe, that's my apartment.
All my stuff is up there.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.445
I need to get up there. I live there!

49:12.520 --> 49:14.090
I can't. You should talk to him.

49:14.600 --> 49:15.726
Sorry.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.767
They can't do that! That can't be legal.

49:18.840 --> 49:21.411
It's not fair!
You can't just randomly evict someone

49:21.520 --> 49:26.082
and ban them from even entering
their place of residence

49:26.160 --> 49:28.606
just because of a recent,
financial hardship.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.691
Who are you texting?

49:30.760 --> 49:31.886
Your mom.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.724
Just to let her know you're okay.

49:36.360 --> 49:39.842
Oh! Uh, listen, when we get into
Dara's, uh, don't introduce yourself.

49:39.920 --> 49:41.684
I'll just do it.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.569
How about I just stay outside?

49:43.640 --> 49:46.246
Okay. Well, I'll be back, either way.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.245
Hey, Dara, it's me.
I really need to talk to you.

49:50.720 --> 49:51.846
It's Imogene.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.763
What should I do?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.650
- Hi.
- Oh, thank God you're home!

49:58.720 --> 50:01.371
Imogene. I thought that
you were in New Jersey with your family?

50:01.440 --> 50:04.489
Yes. Well, mercifully,
I've been given a reprieve.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.007
Can I come in?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.403
Um... We're not dressed.

50:10.800 --> 50:14.168
Oh, okay. Well, can't
you put something on?

50:14.280 --> 50:17.682
Uh, you know what? Maybe it's
just better if we talk like this.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.683
How have you been doing?

50:19.760 --> 50:23.367
I'm great. I just found out
that my father is still alive.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.204
- Oh, my God.
- I know!

50:25.280 --> 50:26.850
- Do you know where he is?
- Yes.

50:26.960 --> 50:29.770
He is in New York.
And he is successful. He wrote this.

50:31.320 --> 50:34.563
Um, anyway, the point is
I cannot go back to New Jersey.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.005
And my landlord is not letting me

50:36.080 --> 50:37.366
into my apartment right now. So...

50:37.440 --> 50:39.249
That's terrible. Where
are you going to stay?

50:39.320 --> 50:41.243
She is not staying here.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.081
Um...

50:43.160 --> 50:46.084
I was hoping that
maybe I could stay with you,

50:46.160 --> 50:47.650
just until Peter and I patch things up,

50:47.720 --> 50:50.121
or until I locate my father,
whichever comes first.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.690
Close the door!

50:52.880 --> 50:55.531
Honestly, I would be
absolutely fine with it,

50:55.600 --> 50:57.090
but James has a very weird thing

50:57.160 --> 50:59.242
about non-blood-related people
staying with us.

50:59.320 --> 51:02.608
I would not be asking you this
unless it was an absolute emergency.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.284
- I have nowhere else to go.
- I know.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.727
And I really, really,
really wanna be there for you right now,

51:06.800 --> 51:10.043
and if it was anything else
I would absolutely say yes, but I...

51:10.120 --> 51:13.044
I promise I won't be any trouble at all.
I won't even talk, I promise.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.451
Dara!

51:15.120 --> 51:17.930
Okay, I'm so sorry.
I have to close the door right now.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.081
And I really understand

51:19.160 --> 51:20.924
if you're not able
to come to the book launch party.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.082
I just want you to focus
on getting better.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.162
- But that's...
- And I love you so much.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.605
Please. Please.
Please. Dara!

51:38.360 --> 51:41.364
Oh, man, it's really gonna pour.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.526
on, my God.

51:51.600 --> 51:54.524
Okay, just hold on, Bubba.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.046
Get the rubber suit on!

51:57.120 --> 51:59.202
We're almost there.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.248
- Get your arm in!
- Are you guys okay?

52:03.520 --> 52:05.284
The lights!
The lights went out from the storm.

52:05.360 --> 52:08.364
Okay, if anyone
has any jewelry or silverware on them,

52:08.440 --> 52:10.169
- stay away from the windows.
- Why? Why?

52:10.240 --> 52:12.641
Well, we were eating
Chinese food with forks, and he sparked.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.609
- Almost blew up the house!
- From Chinese food?

52:14.680 --> 52:16.011
No, no, no. From the metal.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.366
I'm gonna get some candles.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.124
See, he's been
struck by lightning three times,

52:19.240 --> 52:21.641
which officially makes him a conduit.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.051
Tell her what a conduit is.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.446
No, I know what a conduit is.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.167
Okay. Okay.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.805
How do you feel?

52:33.040 --> 52:36.328
I had the distinct
feeling that I was in movement.

52:36.400 --> 52:40.485
Do you know blackness movement?

52:40.560 --> 52:41.721
How long did it last?

52:41.800 --> 52:45.327
Ralph, when you're moving
through other dimensions,

52:45.400 --> 52:47.687
you can't measure time
in an earthly way.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.330
Okay. Hi.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.643
Is there any possibility
you can take your campfire tales

52:52.720 --> 52:54.006
to another more isolated
part of the house?

52:54.080 --> 52:56.287
No, Imogene. This is the center.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.323
It's the only place George is safe.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.562
All right, now,
just go ahead and finish your story.

53:00.640 --> 53:04.008
The electricity had vaporized
nearly every hair on my body.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.924
It took me a year and a half
to grow my eyebrows back.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.002
And the local villagers were able to

53:09.120 --> 53:11.361
hoist me up on top of the elephant,

53:11.440 --> 53:12.487
and at the end,

53:12.560 --> 53:14.483
I was pronounced dead.

53:41.080 --> 53:44.004
Hi, yes. Is there an M. Duncan
available, please?

53:44.080 --> 53:45.366
My briefcase?

53:45.440 --> 53:46.487
Where's my briefcase?

53:46.560 --> 53:48.449
It's in the closet, honey, like always.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.568
Oh, well, do you know
if he's a world-renowned author

53:50.640 --> 53:52.051
and an expert on the
early colonial period?

53:52.120 --> 53:53.406
Are you sure
you don't want something for the road?

53:53.480 --> 53:54.641
No, "colonial"?

53:54.720 --> 53:55.801
No.

53:55.920 --> 53:57.046
Hello?

53:57.120 --> 53:58.201
I don't want to get weighed down.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.167
No. I got to keep light on my toes.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.810
All right, don't forget
to be careful, Bubba.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.488
Somebody should tell
those Romanians that.

54:12.280 --> 54:14.851
I'll make you something for later.
What do you want?

54:14.920 --> 54:17.241
Turkey cheese? Huh?

54:18.480 --> 54:19.925
Extra mayo?

54:20.000 --> 54:21.889
- Yeah.
- Be careful, Bubba.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.921
Where's he going?

54:25.000 --> 54:28.766
Ralph, you know you can't ask that, honey.
It's a secret mission.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.161
- He's going to have sex with another woman.
- Oh!

54:31.240 --> 54:32.321
Don't start with me!

54:32.400 --> 54:35.290
Mom, the guy is a compulsive liar.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.124
You really believe all that CIA shit?

54:37.200 --> 54:40.170
I mean, he told us
he's a time-traveling samurai.

54:40.240 --> 54:43.164
George doesn't lie. He's just lived a
life so exciting it sounds made up.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.287
That's because it is!

54:44.360 --> 54:46.966
Imogene. Um, can I...

54:47.040 --> 54:48.769
He doesn't lie. He never lied to me.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.524
Are you doing anything today?

54:50.640 --> 54:52.802
Uh, I don't know. Why?

54:52.880 --> 54:56.680
I was just wondering if you could help me
with my ultimate... My ultimate plan.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.285
- What? Ultimate plan?
- Yeah, this.

54:58.360 --> 55:00.044
That's me, okay?

55:00.120 --> 55:01.531
- This is gonna be you.
- Uh-huh.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.761
And you're gonna do it?

55:02.840 --> 55:05.286
You'll do it. Okay. Great, great. Okay.

55:14.200 --> 55:15.565
That's her.
That's her right there.

55:15.640 --> 55:16.846
That's her. Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

55:16.920 --> 55:17.967
Back at me.

55:18.040 --> 55:19.280
We're a good pair, right?

55:19.360 --> 55:20.646
Are you sure this is going to work?

55:20.720 --> 55:22.131
What if she finds out we're related?

55:22.840 --> 55:23.841
How would that happen?

55:23.920 --> 55:25.126
What if she sees a photograph?

55:25.840 --> 55:26.966
I'll cut out your face.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.165
Imogene! Look, I'll give you $20.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.366
No,no,no,no.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.411
Just give it to me later.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.611
Are you going now?
You're going right now?

55:37.680 --> 55:39.045
Okay.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.041
Hi.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.326
Hey-

55:46.400 --> 55:47.447
Can I help you?

55:47.640 --> 55:50.723
Um, yeah, Ralph Duncan
referred me to you.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.404
- Oh, yeah?
- He said to check out

55:52.480 --> 55:53.891
your glitter expression.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.371
That's sweet of him.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.281
Hey-

55:58.600 --> 56:00.125
Do you want a demonstration?

56:00.200 --> 56:01.361
Oh, I don't...

56:01.440 --> 56:02.566
Do you want to look around?

56:02.640 --> 56:05.120
Peruse. No pressure.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.610
So, do you want to
know how I know Ralph?

56:08.680 --> 56:10.808
What? Are you guys,
like, related or something?

56:10.960 --> 56:12.121
Ew! Ugh!

56:12.320 --> 56:14.800
Gross. I'm so attracted to him.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.848
That's why I'm saying that,
because that'd be creepy.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.082
Oh. So did you guys hook up?

56:19.160 --> 56:20.321
No.

56:21.280 --> 56:24.443
- Though I've prayed about it. Many times.
- Mmm-hmm.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.402
Had graphic fantasies.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.324
Real graphic stuff.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.565
You know, he gave me crabs.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.242
Oh, you trying to make me jealous?

56:36.240 --> 56:37.924
- No, not like those crabs.
- No, I know.

56:38.040 --> 56:39.041
Come see.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.645
Right. Yeah. Uh-huh.

56:40.720 --> 56:43.200
Oh, yeah. Cute.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.248
So, do you know what you want
your glitter expression to be,

56:45.320 --> 56:46.845
or do you want me to do an assessment?

56:46.920 --> 56:48.160
Oh, um...

56:48.240 --> 56:50.561
What is a glitter expression, exactly?

56:50.640 --> 56:52.404
You see, I like to think of glitter

56:52.480 --> 56:54.209
as your alter-ego shining through.

56:54.800 --> 56:58.327
It's like a sparkly expression
of who you are on the inside.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.767
Oh. I never thought of it like that.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.649
Like, for instance, on my boyfriend,

57:02.720 --> 57:04.449
he's really into the Jets, right?

57:04.520 --> 57:06.807
So he always has me
paint one on his face.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.881
You have a boyfriend?

57:07.960 --> 57:10.088
Yeah. Jason DelPino.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.084
- Why, you know him?
- No. No.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.484
Right, so since you don't know what

57:16.560 --> 57:18.210
you want your glitter expression to be,

57:18.280 --> 57:20.408
I'm just gonna
absorb your energy for a second,

57:20.480 --> 57:22.767
and that way I
can paint something that best describes

57:22.840 --> 57:24.410
who you are on the inside.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.528
Oh, I can just get the cupcake.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.281
Imogene, that
doesn't make any sense.

57:46.400 --> 57:48.721
Allyson, she talks to
me when we're at work.

57:48.800 --> 57:51.610
And one time she even asked me
if I thought she looked hot.

57:51.720 --> 57:53.722
I bet if she didn't have a
boyfriend she'd be into it.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.928
If she really liked me,
she would have an affair.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.570
Maybe Allyson isn't the kind of person

57:57.640 --> 58:00.120
who can recognize and appreciate

58:00.200 --> 58:02.567
how special and unique you are.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.243
She's the only girl I know besides Mom.

58:05.320 --> 58:08.085
Well, maybe it's time you start thinking

58:08.160 --> 58:10.288
about going farther than the boardwalk.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.129
Having new experiences,

58:13.200 --> 58:16.010
and meeting people
with whom you share things in common.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.321
What kind of people
would I share things in common with?

58:19.000 --> 58:22.561
Maybe Jacques Cousteau
has a granddaughter or something.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.883
I don't know off the top of my head,
but all I'm saying is

58:25.960 --> 58:28.611
there's a whole world
out there that you've never experienced.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.331
You really think it's
worth experiencing?

58:32.960 --> 58:34.325
Sometimes.

59:00.840 --> 59:04.686
So now, our next group
really got it goin' on!

59:04.760 --> 59:07.525
The original American superstars.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.206
The... The... The... The...

59:10.280 --> 59:12.123
Backstreet Boys!

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.210
My homeboys. The Backstreet Boys.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.686
Hey-

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.081
I can't believe you made it.
What did you think?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.686
Um...

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.162
it was fun. it was fun.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.044
You look so different with makeup on.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.326
Well, that's good, I think.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.811
I wouldn't want a face that looks like

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.247
I'm wearing makeup all the time, right?

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.645
Um, listen, seriously,
thank you so much for coming.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.404
I really appreciate it.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.404
I think you actually brought
the head-count up to like 19.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.164
Which is pretty cool.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.528
Yeah. No problem. I owed you one.
So now we're even forever.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.011
Forever.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.128
Hey, Lee. Are you coming out with us?

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.645
Maybe.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.131
I hope so.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.645
Hey-

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.610
Okay, were Britney Spears
and Christina Aguilera the same person?

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.681
Yeah, they totally were.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.761
I knew it!

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.606
So, what do you, uh, feel like doing?

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.882
Um, well, I'm probably
just gonna head back

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.689
and try to find my dad some more...

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.843
It's like 11:00, you sure about that?

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.445
You should come out with us.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.206
Oh, gosh, that sounds like fun.
But I really should head back.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.521
And I don't want my mom to worry.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.761
Wow.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.440
That's really sad,

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.967
because you're a writer and that's the
best excuse you can come up with.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.123
All right, look, to be honest,
I don't really feel like going out.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.362
And in addition to that, I don't drink,

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.408
and you and I
don't really know each other well enough

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.804
to determine whether we would even have
fun in a social setting together.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.247
And, we're practically
from different generations.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.247
You're right. No, you're
right, I agree with you there.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.807
I mean, God forbid we went out and I
said something that was really lame

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.245
and you felt embarrassed for me,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.560
and we had nothing to talk about.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.529
- It'd be messy.
- Yeah.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.721
I mean, I'm not being negative,

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.768
I'm just saying the
possibility certainly exists,

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.241
and for us not to
acknowledge that would be reckless.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.130
No, I agree. I think
it would be reckless.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.282
I think if we did that we'd probably

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.408
be taking like a gigantic risk.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.323
- For sure.
- I agree.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.846
Okay.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.921
See you later.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.402
But the thing about that is,
um, I don't give a shit.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.370
I'm sorry this place is so loud,

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.442
but that's a good sign.
All my friends are here.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.881
Hey!

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.962
- You wanna dance?
- No, thank you!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.365
Hey

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.445
Well, well.
Look who finally made it.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.602
All right, so this is Nick, that's Lucy,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.570
Charlotte, Antonio, Sherry and Veronica.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.210
Guys, this is Imogene.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.963
- Hello.
- Yo!

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.362
Oh, my God.
I think my mom had that same vest!

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.961
Cool.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.769
So, how do you guys know each other?

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.285
Uh, through her family.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.930
Oh, is she, like, your aunt?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.001
No.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.161
Do you want a drink?

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.287
Charlotte, you guys want a drink?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.566
You want a water, soda, something?

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.880
Pellegrino.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.725
Hey, Lee, I'll take another
Jack and Coke now,

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.689
and I'll get you back later.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.407
You know, I'm gonna have
a Long Island Iced Tea, too.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.164
- A large.
- Oh.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.322
I thought that you didn't drink?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.323
Come on, man. You heard
what the lady said.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.401
Get her some alcohol.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.848
Yeah, you heard what the lady said.
Get me some alcohol.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.087
Um... Okay, great.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.165
All right.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.970
This place has crazy lights.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.605
I feel like I'm on fire,
but my thoughts are really slow.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.844
How do you make it stop?

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.285
Drink more.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.651
Okay, let's go dance. Come on.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.045
- I don't want to dance here.
- Come on.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.485
I don't like this song.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.401
I should drink more.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.891
Everyone is so nice.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.325
I know, right?

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.688
And I forgot that
hanging out with regular people

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.287
could be such an enthralling experience.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.085
I feel like I want to
expand my social circle

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.811
and get, like, acrylic
nails or something.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.405
No, no. No acrylic nails.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.411
Okay, seriously.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.603
- Did you go to Yale?
- Yeah.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.251
I really did. I went to Yale.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.481
Okay, what did you study?

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.884
I majored in music and French history.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.201
And my senior year I
was a Whiffenpoof.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.169
- A what?
- You never heard of the Whiffenpoofs.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.208
That is not... You're making up groups.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.566
You never heard
of the Whiffenpoofs?

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.920
No, that's not a real thing!

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.048
That is absolute... All right.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.884
Okay, I'm getting the parts wrong,
it doesn't matter.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.367
It's better with the
gloves and the tuxedo.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.521
- I'm coming up.
- Oh!

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.285
I get it. I get it.
That's very funny. Oh!

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.725
Okay.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.410
I'm gonna fall if I stand on that.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.527
You're gonna sit.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.968
You're so good!

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.487
You are. You're such a great singer.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.410
Why are you working in that shithole?

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.841
Because that shithole pays me.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.843
I think... I think you should be famous.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.844
I think you should be famous, too.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.966
I do.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.042
I almost was.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.525
Kind of.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.762
Well, no one told you to stop writing.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.206
I think you're
just as good now as you were then.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.851
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.604
Actually, I do.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.364
I do know what I'm talking about,

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.044
because I found your secret hole.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.482
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, your secret hole.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.042
Behind your bureau,
in your wall, in your room.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.121
I...

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.602
I was moving stuff,
and I just found a bunch of your plays.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.490
What? You went into my secret hole
and you found my plays,

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.971
and you read them
without even asking me?

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.769
- I was just trying to see what it was.
- That's private.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.888
- I'm sorry.
- You don't read other people's stuff

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.691
they keep in the wall. If it's in
the wall, it means don't read it.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.841
Okay, listen, calm down, hear me out.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.888
I just went to go see what it was,

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.883
and I ended up staying up all night

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.284
reading this great play
about you becoming a woman.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.045
What was it called?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.770
<i>Imogene's Period.</i>

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.084
Was it good?

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.491
Yeah.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.524
It really was.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.202
I really liked it. I think...

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.846
I think you were born to be a writer.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.765
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.251
Are your sheets clean?

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.481
What do you mean?

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.642
Did you have sex in them?

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.482
- Only with myself.
- Ew.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.531
That feels good.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.970
Where are you...

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.406
I feel like I am dying.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.131
I think that's because you're hungover.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.247
How long does this last?

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.845
I don't know.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.042
Sometimes it helps if
you eat McDonald's.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.808
- Jesus.
- The Bousche never came home.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.166
Uh... Wait. What?

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.207
He left yesterday morning.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:32.682
I made him a sandwich,
he never came back.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.125
- Did he say where he was going?
- What?

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.171
Oh, God. Your voice is like
burning knives through my skull.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:42.770
Imogene?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.680
Oh!

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.042
Did you guys have sex?

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.651
Thank you.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.325
Um, listen, uh...

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.721
What day is it?

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.926
It's Thursday.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.684
Shit! on, my God!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.723
It's Dara's book party!

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.882
Just to clarify, this is the girl that

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.769
wouldn't let you into
her apartment, right?

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.922
If I don't go to this thing tonight,
people are going to speculate

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.246
about my mental state and what happened.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.403
And I need to go there,
and prove to them that I am sane

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.004
and that I am in control of my life.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.244
- All right, let's go.
- What?

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.084
Yeah, I'll take you.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.082
Just to clarify. You
mean, like, as my date?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.250
Uh, a date impersonator.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.684
Look at you.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.690
After you.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.681
Wait! Wait!

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.281
I'm coming with you.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.361
What?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.328
Mom said you're going to New York.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.571
You know that it's
past the boardwalk though, right?

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.529
I think I'm ready.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.691
You sure you know how to get back?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.001
Yes, that's why I have my GPS watch.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:56.325
I'll meet you right here,
45.2 degrees north by 79.3 degrees west.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.880
<i>At 7:30.</i>

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.530
So you're sure you
want to bring this shell-thing with you?

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.568
What better place
to try it out than New York City?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.644
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.401
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.047
Just watch where you're going.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.406
He'll be fine.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.801
Yeah.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.007
Oh!

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.001
Ow!

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.770
"I Found the One."

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.921
Did you read it?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.365
I helped write it.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.930
Then it's gotta be good.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.005
It doesn't really matter. Her uncle
owns the publishing company, so...

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.082
Hmm. Good, old-fashioned nepotism.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.131
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.722
Hey! I'm talking to you.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.450
What's inside of it?

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.488
- I'm the... I go inside of it.
- What?

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.361
- Oh, my God!
- Hey guys!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.569
Imogene! What a surprise!

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.449
That's an interesting dress.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.124
I hardly know
why my presence would be a surprise,

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.804
I confirmed over a month ago.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.927
Of course, of course!

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.482
We just... We were concerned
that you might not be here tonight.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.130
- But you are.
- Yay!

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.247
It's wonderful.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.288
I'm going to go to the bar.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.811
Long Island Iced Tea?

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.120
Very funny.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.281
So, is everyone here?

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.407
Yes. Everyone.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.648
Anabelle and George are
talking to David Sedaris.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.881
And I think I saw Peter.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.007
Wait. What?

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.643
- Oh.
- Peter's here?

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.051
No, actually
I just saw him...

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.121
No.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.328
Oh, my God, it's him.
He is here.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.085
I forgot. I forgot!

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.207
Peter?

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.164
- Oh!
- Imogene.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.567
They told me that
you weren't going to be here tonight.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.331
So, what? I almost die and you just
aren't going to talk to me again?

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.289
They won't let
you go to the garden to smoke,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.361
can you believe?

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.851
I can't, that's...

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.603
- That's terrible.
- Hello.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.125
This is club soda with bitters.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.168
It'll be good for your stomach.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.046
Are you joking?

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.644
How do you live with someone

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.805
and show up at
a friend's party with some random model!

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.848
- What's random?
- Just give me a second here.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.565
She's not random, okay?

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.405
Our parents summer together in Provence.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.166
You wouldn't have even cared
if I died, would you?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.641
Oh, my God. You would be happy.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.206
I would not be happy if you died, okay?

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.123
That's why I asked Dara
to go check on you.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.247
Wait. What?

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.160
Hey!

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.526
Hi. WOW.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.329
You knew Peter wasn't coming
and you didn't tell me?

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.640
How could you do that?

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.560
Are you Imogene Duncan?

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.846
Yeah.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.570
Ralph, are you okay?
What happened?

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.846
How do you know this man?

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.967
He's my brother.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.161
Keep him off
the street, please.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.205
He almost ended
up in Gitmo.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.362
What is that junk
he just dragged into my party?

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.681
That is a man-made replica
of an exoskeleton

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.206
that he designed and constructed
by himself.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.851
Which is more than I could
ever say for you!

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.611
Okay.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.885
No, don't walk away.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.530
How could you not be
honest with me?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.883
Because if I did that it would be a
full time job, all right, Imogene?

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.928
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Imogene, let it go.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.050
I think what Dara means is
sometimes you seem sad.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.487
No, Hannah, that's not what I meant.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.723
You need to be very careful about
who you speak to like that,

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.404
because the only reason
why you're here right now,

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.847
and know all of these people,
is because of me.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.526
And you're living in a fantasy world
if you think you belong here.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.246
And now she's gonna cry.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.448
Hurry, Imogene. Get in here.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.760
- Get in the shell.
- No, it's okay, Ralph.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.171
You didn't even write your own book.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.410
Like I care what you think?
I don't even know how you got in here.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.527
I came here with Imogene.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.690
Imogene, wait.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.366
Picked that up in Chinatown.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.727
Imogene?

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.245
Are you okay?

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.530
It's just like...

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.443
You spend so long staring at one thing.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.168
And then,
one day everything else comes into view

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.403
and there you are. I'm like a big joke.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.520
No, look, hey, they're assholes.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.921
You think I've never
had to deal with people like that?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.005
I was inundated with all that
bullshit my entire time in college.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.367
I couldn't wait to get out.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.124
Well, at least you had somewhere to go.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.402
834 Sutton Place.
New York, New York, 10021.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.126
Dad lives there.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.206
Thanks.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.045
Ah, it's not a problem.
I don't mind the drive.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.566
No. I just mean thank you.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.281
Oh.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.531
Of course.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.445
Good luck.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.884
Hi. We're here
to see Maxwell P. Duncan.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.167
And who should I say you are?

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.811
His children.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.642
Just a moment, please.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.120
How did you find
out I was still alive?

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.248
Two weeks after you died,

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.609
I saw you buying toothpaste at the A&P.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.686
And then, when I turned 21,

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.525
I hired a private investigator
with my birthday money.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.640
So you've known all this time?

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.767
Yes, sir.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.241
But you didn't try to contact me before.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.204
I was waiting for my
sister to come home.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.328
Well, please come up.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.290
Could you keep an eye
on that for me, please?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.161
Do you think we should hug?

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.844
Sure.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.088
- Does your mother know you're here?
- No.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.491
She's mad at you.
She told us, you know, not to come.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.005
Oh, how exquisite.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.003
Is this a Joseph Kato?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.161
Oh, yes, it is.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.368
It's been in my wife's family for years.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.451
Oh, yes, Virginia.
These are my children.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.642
This is Imogene.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.767
A pleasure.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.921
And this...

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.731
- This is Ralph.
- Ralph.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.211
- Hello.
- Hello, Ralph.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.450
Did you know that we were alive?

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.731
Actually, no.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.086
Okay.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.882
I can get you one of
your own, if you'd like.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.086
Yes, please.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.205
Have you produced any
offspring together?

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.566
No. We can't.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.449
I have a condition.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.885
Which one?

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.566
Virginia is on
the board of trustees at the Guggenheim.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.042
Oh, the Guggenheim is,
by far, my favorite.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.929
I've seen
the Kandinsky exhibit there three times.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.965
I started reading your book
on agrarian America,

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.566
and I had no idea
that the Pilgrims were alcoholics.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.085
Oh, yes. Yes, it's true.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.561
They preferred the taste
of beer to water,

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.529
thus contributing to their notorious

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.409
legacy of being drunk sodomists.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.528
Do you know who invented pumpkin pie?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.523
Oh, I believe it... It was the Pilgrims.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.609
So sodomists invented pumpkin pie?

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.761
Evidently.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.049
But it's got such a nice
image, pumpkin pie.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.770
- Ralph.
- it's delicious.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.406
Why don't you tell us about you?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.168
I'd be happy to.
My name is Ralph Duncan,

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.321
I'm an inventor.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.842
My main focus is the science
of physical self-preservation.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.766
- Yes, please.
- Based on the exoskeletons of mollusks.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.324
Imogene, why don't you tell us
something about yourself?

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.370
Imogene Duncan doesn't
have anyone to marry.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.042
She doesn't have anywhere
to live right now.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.207
And all of her stuff is gone,

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.887
except for this piece of shit.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.450
But she used to be a writer.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.329
And what did she used to write?

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.404
She could write the kind of
stuff that could trick people

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.642
into thinking she was the real deal.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.647
Until they realized
that I was just an impersonator.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.202
There is a very, very
odd taste to this soup.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.250
And I can't catch it.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.526
Cinnamon?

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.125
No. It's an herb.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.407
I'm gonna go lay down for two minutes.
Excuse me.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.962
Turmeric? Turmeric?

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.567
It's so sad. How long has she
had her drinking problem?

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.486
Like two days.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.886
<i>...36CXY, playing the sexiest
music from the '80s, '90s and today.</i>

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.565
<i>Remember this one?</i>

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.084
You know, when I first met your mother,

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.367
I thought she was
the sexiest thing I'd ever seen.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.331
Oh, she was up on stage,
dancing in her little costume.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.731
Are you saying Mom was a stripper?

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.007
Well, back then
they were called Go-Go dancers.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.086
And I had never seen anything like her.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.367
I mean, she was 19, a college dropout.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.846
I had just gotten out of the Army,
and, you know,

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.968
when we first got married,
she went and got pregnant

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.280
and never even asked me.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.241
I was just beginning to wonder
if I even loved her or not.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.683
I was 21!

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.922
Can you even comprehend
how that must have felt?

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.204
Were you ever happy with her?

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.124
Look, I tried. Okay?
There was simply nothing to be done.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.283
She wanted Ocean City,
and I needed more than that.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.522
Why didn't you just take us with you?

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.364
What about when I was traveling?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.365
You would have grown to resent me.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.410
And that wouldn't have
been fair for any of us.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.324
So, you thought it was fair
to just pretend like we didn't exist?

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.845
Didn't you love me more that way?

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.241
Didn't you miss us?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.891
You were children, I barely knew you.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.803
I mean, it's not like
you were fully-formed people.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.011
I mean, honestly, can you actually say

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.445
that you really knew who I was?

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.521
You were my father.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.650
I knew that I loved you.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.042
Yeah, well, you must admit,
your mother was pretty...

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.687
She has her eccentricities,

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.401
but she didn't exactly have it
easy raising Ralph by herself.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.811
Look, I want to say something to you.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.607
Would you look at me?

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.409
Obviously I wasn't much of a father.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.847
And I can see how that has done
some collateral damage to you,

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.967
as a woman.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:46.924
So let me help you now.
How much money do you need?

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.171
If you can believe it, you actually
remind me a little bit of myself.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:03.162
So, I guess that me helping you
is like me helping me, right?

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.562
Can you just tell me
where your nearest bathroom is?

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.291
Yes, it's down the hall.
Second door on your right.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.044
- Excuse me.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.327
I've hit this thing
with sticks, rocks.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.607
I've subjected it to wind tests.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.761
Come on, Ralph, let's go.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.964
- We're going home.
- What?

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.644
No, I want to do a
demonstration for Dad.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.051
Well, you can show him another time.
Okay?

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.326
What? No, I want to do it right now.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.368
You can't do it right now
because we're leaving.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.521
Why are we leaving?

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.806
Because it's
time to leave, Ralph.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.405
Doesn't he want to see it?

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.410
No.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.050
He doesn't want to see it.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.402
Do you want to talk about it?

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.091
Bubba?

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.409
Hey. It's just us.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.684
What happened to you?

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.684
Dad's a piece of shit.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.966
You saw him?

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.606
Wait.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.241
You are a stupid shell!

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.800
You are a stupid, stupid shell!

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.441
Honey.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.642
- Do you want something to eat?
- No!

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.486
Imogene?

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.531
Honey.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.844
I get why you did it.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.444
I get why you lied.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.164
Honey. Tell me what happened.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.609
Let's just say it was underwhelming.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:27.721
As you predicted.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.082
You know, um, there's a saying
in the samurai tradition.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.322
The Bousche taught it to me.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.930
It's something like,

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.008
"Sometimes you need to see the snake

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.686
"in the bush to know it's really there."

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.967
You know, maybe I was wrong.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.725
Maybe you needed to see the snake.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.761
Is that your version of an apology?

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.521
Well...

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.003
If I say I'm sorry,

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.686
then I'm worried that
you'll just get all mad

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.366
and yell at me for ruining your life.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.691
And then I'll feel like shit. And I...

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.003
I just can't win with you, Imogene.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.130
Well, maybe, just this once,
you can throw caution to the wind

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.921
and try saying it anyway,
and see what happens?

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.050
Well, okay.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.246
Um...

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.568
I guess I'm sorry, you
know, for lying to you.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.761
Even though it was for your own good.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.650
And now you can see I
was right to do it.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.404
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.849
That's my flipper.

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.606
Oh, my God. I've been
looking for this forever.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.081
I hope the other one's
still in my trunk.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.763
Hello!
Is anyone home?

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.121
Oh, my God. It's George! He's back!

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.441
I knew he would come back to me!

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.761
Honey?

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.887
Oh, my God!

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.161
Oh, my God, honey.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.767
I was so worried
that something had happened to you.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.606
Is my sandwich ready?

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.330
Of course it is, sweetie.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.123
I'll get it for you.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.930
How's that apple, Lee?

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.362
Do you want potato chips?

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.528
Are they sour cream and onion?

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.646
Oh, my God!

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.921
Honey!

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.966
Armando.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.850
Don't even think about it.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.684
Don't shoot. We'll
co-operate, all right?

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.646
Here.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.721
Don't shoot.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.407
Everyone in there!

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.527
You have a gun?

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.201
What the
hell are you saying?

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.884
Mom?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.161
Come any closer, you die!

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.685
No, honey!

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.686
How did you find me?

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.444
We're being robbed, just
give him your purse.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.761
The briefcase is in the
closet over there.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.921
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.445
Who are you, man?

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.330
Lady, why don't you go
get me the briefcase.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.682
You're still smarting
over Antwerp, aren't you?

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.331
You really think
there's a game to be won here?

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.562
Don't try any heroics.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.290
Just let them go and kill me.
They don't know anything.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.407
Oh, you're right.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.767
Except maybe what I look like.
What kind of a gun I have.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.360
Maybe I should give them
my mailing address, too,

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.249
so after I kill them,

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.641
they can send me a postcard from hell!

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.482
What the fuck?

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.207
Somebody grab the gun!

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.524
<i>Shocking news in Ocean City tonight,</i>

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.206
<i>where police arrested
an international assassin</i>

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:56.080
<i>for holding a government
operative and his family at gunpoint.</i>

01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.367
<i>However, the attack was thwarted</i>

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.887
<i>when a family member used a device
known as the Human Shell...</i>

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.564
<i>- Yo.
- ...to overcome their captor.</i>

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.880
Hey, shut up. Shut up!

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.371
<i>Michelle Connors is
live now at the scene.</i>

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.726
I know this guy.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.610
Hi, Paul. I'm here with
one of the victims, Ralph Duncan,

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.648
who is also the inventor
of the Human Shell.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.846
Oh, shit.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.527
Well, I am the one
who created the Human Shell,

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.968
which is the ultimate
protective barrier against bodily harm,

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.802
but really it was my sister
who saved our family.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.326
Hey, you guys
want to get a shot of us over here?

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.970
Hello. Hey, honey.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.649
So tell us about the shell.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.761
Yes, Michelle, I will
tell you about the shell.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:49.041
The shell is a creation of mine...

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.203
So he took me with him, right?

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.126
And they have this machine
where you can win a $20 gold piece.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.441
And on my third try, it hit.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.445
So there I am, I'm talking about all the
things I'm gonna spend it on.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.403
And my grandpa stops me and he says,

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.490
"Oh, no, I can't ever
spend it because..."

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.641
Um...

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.848
Oh, shit, What did he say?

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.046
Mom, come on.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.286
Right, right, right.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.691
He says,

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.043
"I can't ever spend it because as
long as I have it in my pocket,

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.481
"I will always be a winner."

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.767
So I kept it.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.721
You're giving it to me?

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.728
We gotta keep it in the family.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.131
Mom.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.845
Life is a brief flickering.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.720
Well, sometimes the
darkness is self-imposed.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.610
And to accuse your daughter of a crime

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.081
may indeed be the best way to find her.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.202
There's the poster. Here's everybody.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.602
Everybody getting in their limo.
Rock stars after a great show.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.523
There's the Bousche!

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.562
I'm going to have to confiscate this.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.170
That's my phone.

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.925
There can be no
physical evidence of my existence.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.248
Look, if you give me your number,

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.761
<i>I'll talk to The Times
about doing a feature article.</i>

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.001
- Really?
- I'm so sorry.

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.243
By the way, this is Whit Stillman,
superb writer and filmmaker.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.766
Delighted to meet you.
I liked the play so much.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.490
I'd love to ask you some
questions about it.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.289
- Do you have any time?
- Imogene!

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.688
Hurry up already.
We're paying by the hour here.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.528
Um, you know what?
I'm sorry. I, uh... I have to go.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.525
My family is waiting for me.
I have to go.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.646
Everybody! Three!

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.041
Two, one!
