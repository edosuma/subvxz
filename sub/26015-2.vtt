How are you gonna coach him?
You can't even tattoo

04:13.252 --> 04:15.672
are readability right

04:15.755 --> 04:19.007
<i>composition, bold lines,</i>

04:19.091 --> 04:20.468
{\an8}That's why they call it
the fundamentals.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.679
{\an8}It is the core of art.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.765
- A true artist can transform
even the ugliest surface

04:25.848 --> 04:28.017

a weak artist to hide.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.922

04:58.006 --> 05:00.425

05:00.508 --> 05:01.676
- We're testing fundamentals,
and this is a great way,

05:01.759 --> 05:04.679
because you have ridges,
you have different things.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.639
These are the same obstacles

not just tattoo artists.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.978
Make it a blockbuster.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.023
- Teamwork is the most
important thing here.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.357
There's a lot of you
on each team.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.109
We expect full coverage.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.029

06:02.862 --> 06:04.781

06:09.619 --> 06:11.454

The chicks are at the bottom.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.791

a really sick robot.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.652

<i>and hands are excellent.</i>

32:56.808 --> 32:58.476
<i>The shadowing</i>
<i>is really, really nice.</i>

<i>of rich contrast.</i>

33:00.019 --> 33:01.896

- Fundamentally, the design

33:13.783 --> 33:15.368

33:15.451 --> 33:16.994

Where's the clock?

33:20.748 --> 33:23.126
