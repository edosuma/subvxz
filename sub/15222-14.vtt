00:01.668 --> 00:05.661
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:19.449
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:21.544
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.299
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.933
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:47.479
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.538
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:57.312
<i>Well?</i>

00:57.390 --> 01:00.257
Uh, well-w-well, what?

01:00.326 --> 01:03.090
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:03.163 --> 01:06.428
Uh, could you, uh,
r- repeat that question?

01:06.499 --> 01:11.527
<i>Is the size of a man's feet related
to the size ofhis love muscle?</i>

01:19.979 --> 01:22.470
Oh, boy.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.482
<i>Should I repeat the question?</i>

02:40.560 --> 02:42.892
N- No, don't repeat it.
I heard it just fine.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.624
The man's size of his foot-

02:46.799 --> 02:48.892
You know,

02:48.968 --> 02:51.562
clowns wear really big shoes.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.573
<i>The guy I'm dating
has very small feet.</i>

02:54.641 --> 02:57.007
Uh, well, uh,

02:57.076 --> 02:59.670
my feet-

02:59.746 --> 03:01.680
Of course, why would you...

03:01.748 --> 03:03.909
want to know about Dr. Ruth's feet?

03:03.983 --> 03:07.384
But I have a friend who has-

03:07.453 --> 03:09.387
And-

03:09.455 --> 03:11.389
Could we go to the next caller, please?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.584
This is Tony from Lindenhurst.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.594
I really dig your show.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.256
<i>Thank you, Tony. I got this
problem with my girlfriend.</i>

03:18.331 --> 03:21.095
<i>No matter where we go, she always
puts her hand on my crotch.</i>

03:21.167 --> 03:23.158
Ah. Uh,

03:23.236 --> 03:26.433
have you tried just holding hands?

03:26.506 --> 03:29.270
<i>Well, she does it when
I'm driving on the turnpike.</i>

03:31.678 --> 03:33.976
Make her sit in the backseat. Next.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.948
What has gotten into her?
I think it's funny.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.950
You think balancing a spoon
on your nose is funny.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.952
<i>It is.
I have a problem most people would envy.</i>

03:41.020 --> 03:43.887
Yes? What is your problem?

03:43.957 --> 03:47.552
<i>Well, I get orgasms that are
so incredible and overwhelming...</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:50.892
<i>that I end up pushing my husband
out ofbed.</i>

03:50.964 --> 03:53.728
<i>The last time,
he got all bruised and scraped.</i>

03:53.800 --> 03:56.200
<i>Is there any answer for me?</i>

03:57.470 --> 03:59.563
Knee pads? Next.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.073
Commercial.
She's on a roll.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.405
I said, commercial.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.741
<i>We'll be right back
with Dr. Ruth Westheimer...</i>

04:06.813 --> 04:10.249
after these important messages.
Are you all right, Ruth?

04:10.316 --> 04:12.477
Uh-huh. I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.745
<i>Knee pads?</i>

04:15.822 --> 04:17.915
Kinky.
Eh-

04:17.991 --> 04:20.322
Don't question me while we're on
the air. What's the matter with you?

04:20.392 --> 04:24.090
Have you been here, Al? Listening
in? Yeah, I heard a little of it.

04:24.163 --> 04:27.826
I gotta get out of here fast. Why?
This sounds like a great leap to me.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.198
You just sit here and
you talk about sex. No.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.602
Sam, look at it
as a learning experience.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.936
It may sound like fun,
but it's not for me.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.306
They're asking some
very embarrassing questions.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.470
Like what? You heard the
one about the knee pads.

04:39.545 --> 04:43.208
Sam, sex is not dirty.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.615
It's a very natural thing.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.882
Being frank about it
and educating your children...

04:48.955 --> 04:52.652
to be morally responsible
and safe...

04:52.725 --> 04:54.716
is better than...

04:54.794 --> 04:56.785
<i>sweeping it under the rug.</i>

04:56.863 --> 05:00.492
That's a pretty mature attitude,
coming from somebody like you.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.899
It's not coming from me. That's coming
from the real Dr. Ruth in the waiting room.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.804
But you remember it until Ziggy
can figure out why you're here.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.332
No, you can't leave! You're an expert on this
stuff. You gotta help me answer these questions.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.709
You're doing fine. I'm not
doing fine. You gotta stay here.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.749
Help me answer these questions. Oh, hey!
You know the question about the shoe size?

05:16.816 --> 05:19.216
- Yeah.
- Just call me big foot.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.310
<i>- We're coming back in-
- Al! Al!</i>

05:21.387 --> 05:24.083
- What was that?
- I'll be ready.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.092
<i>Welcome back to
Dr. Ruth's Frank Talk About Sex.</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:29.458
<i>Our next caller is Annie
from Manhattan.</i>

05:29.529 --> 05:31.463
<i>Go ahead, Annie.
You're on the air.</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:33.465
<i>Hi, Dr. Ruth.
Hi, Annie.</i>

05:33.533 --> 05:36.934
<i>Hi. Uh, I'm calling because
I have a problem with my boss.</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:40.200
<i>What kind of a problem?
Well, at first he was really nice.</i>

05:40.273 --> 05:42.867
<i>I'm new in town,
so he took me out for a drink after work...</i>

05:42.942 --> 05:45.410
<i>as kind of a welcome
to New York City,</i>

05:45.478 --> 05:47.412
but then he started
coming on to me.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.210
- He wanted to have sex with me.
- What did you do?

05:50.283 --> 05:53.548
<i>Well, I said no. I keep saying
no, but he won't leave me alone.</i>

05:53.619 --> 05:56.554
<i>- He keeps calling me on the phone-
- I've got multiple orgasms on line four.</i>

05:56.622 --> 05:58.613
Let her talk.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.626
<i>I can't say them on the air,
but he sends me letters too,</i>

06:01.694 --> 06:03.958
<i>and I know he's been following me.
We're out in 10 seconds.</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:06.590
- Let her finish.
- Annie, have you told anyone about this?

06:06.666 --> 06:08.964
<i>No. I can't.
I'll lose myjob.</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:10.969
We're out.
Go ahead.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.028
That's all the time we have
for today, Annie,

06:13.106 --> 06:15.734
<i>but you can meet Dr. Ruth in person at Cleary's Bookstore
- Stay on the line, okay?</i>

06:15.808 --> 06:17.833
Annie, did you hear me?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.935
<i>Someone's coming. I gotta go.
Annie.</i>

06:20.012 --> 06:22.378
<i>Dr. Ruth's Frank Talk About Sex.</i>

06:23.449 --> 06:26.043
<i>Annie?</i>

06:33.226 --> 06:35.217
Why did you cut her off?

06:35.294 --> 06:37.262
I left the line open. She
hung up. I'm sorry, Dr. Ruth.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.493
- Doug never should have cut her off.
- I didn't cut her off.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.727
You think we could trace the call?
Too late now.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.895
- This is not my fault.
- I never said it was.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.166
No, you didn't have to.
Sam, let's talk.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.641
You two look like you could use a
little privacy, huh? You're projecting.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.407
You're feeling guilty, and you're projecting
it on me. Great. This is psychobabble, right?

06:54.480 --> 06:57.074
You never used to talk this way
until you started to see the shrink.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.084
Therapist, Doug, not shrink.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.086
Therapist.
Therapist.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.145
Al, I think I know why I'm here.
Oh?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.713
It's that girl who just called.
Oh, was that the call...

07:05.792 --> 07:08.727
from the woman who kicked her husband
out of bed when she was having an orgasm?

07:08.795 --> 07:10.729
No, no. Didn't you hear
the last phone call?

07:10.797 --> 07:12.731
No. I must have missed it.
How could you miss it?

07:12.799 --> 07:15.563
I was with Dr. Ruth.
She is a sharp cookie.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.569
All right. The caller
said that her boss...

07:17.637 --> 07:20.401
was harassing her on the job
because she wouldn't sleep with him.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.237
I want you to ask Ziggy what the
odds are I'm here to help her.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.243
What's her name?
Annie.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.575
Just Annie?

07:27.647 --> 07:30.616
Just Annie? Well, I didn't
have time to get her last name.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.617
Annie. She lives in Manhattan.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.619
Annie in Manhattan.
Yeah.

07:34.687 --> 07:39.989
<i>Well, since there were 6,280 Annies
in Manhattan in 1984,</i>

07:40.059 --> 07:44.018
don't you think you could be
just a little more specific?

07:44.096 --> 07:47.259
I can't be more specific, Al,
because I don't know anything else.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.858
She sounded young, okay?
She sounded like she was in her 20s.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.734
Oh, the young-sounding Annie.
She's Annie. She lives in Manhattan.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.205
I don't know any more. I think
you should just forget Annie...

07:55.274 --> 07:57.868
because Ziggy says
there's a 72% chance...

07:57.944 --> 08:00.572
that you're here
to play with matches.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.580
What?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.639
Stinkin' thing.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.708
Play- Oh, ma-ma- matchmaker.
To play matchmaker.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.720
Matchmaker? To whom?
That makes sense,

08:08.788 --> 08:10.949
because Dr. Ruth loves to play matchmaker. W
- Who, Al?

08:11.023 --> 08:12.957
She's made, oh, hundreds
and hundreds of matches.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.959
Al. Al. Who?
Just dozens and dozens.

08:15.027 --> 08:16.961
Doug and Debbie.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.963
Doug and Debbie who?
Doug and-

08:19.031 --> 08:21.966
Debbie Schaefer, your producer,
and Doug Bridges, your announcer.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.968
They're on one week, they're off one week
- No. No, Al.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.197
But Ziggy says they should be
together. They hate each other.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.706
Well, every couple
has a spat now and then.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.708
You jerk.
Motor mouth.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.767
Pig.
What do you want from me?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.336
<i>Nothing.! Then why did you make such
a big deal about that phone call?</i>

08:35.414 --> 08:37.347
<i>Oh, big deal, big deal.</i>

08:37.416 --> 08:39.577
It's a match made in heaven.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.850
<i>Yo, taxi.! Yo, taxi, over here.!</i>

08:52.131 --> 08:54.122
<i>Next, please.</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:56.998
<i>I can't thank you enough
for your book, Dr. Ruth.</i>

08:57.069 --> 08:59.537
<i>Oh, well, you don't have
to thank me. No, really.</i>

08:59.605 --> 09:01.698
<i>It helped me explain things
to my daughter,</i>

09:01.774 --> 09:05.540
<i>and believe me, I'd rather have her hear
those things from me than someone else.</i>

09:05.611 --> 09:07.579
<i>Oh, great. Next?</i>

09:07.647 --> 09:11.105
Your chapter on foreplay
was so imaginative.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.549
That's me- uh, imaginative.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.712
Any other pointers?

09:15.788 --> 09:18.723
Uh, no. No, everything
you need to know is in here.

09:18.791 --> 09:22.386
I mean, everything you need
to know about... everything.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.389
You know, my favorite quote
from your book is,

09:27.466 --> 09:30.833
"Having good sex is like getting
to Carnegie Hall:

09:30.903 --> 09:33.667
All it takes is practice,
practice, practice. "

09:33.739 --> 09:36.071
Yeah, practice makes perfect.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.904
Okeydoke.
Could you make it out to Annie?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.574
I brought my own pen.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.419
<i>Annie, what's your last name?
Wilkins. Annie Wilkins.</i>

09:50.489 --> 09:52.787
Listen, I'm sorry
I hung up on you.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.349
I was at work.
You know how it is.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.362
The walls have ears.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.365
Where do you work, Annie?
At a law office.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.266
I'm just a secretary, but someday
I want to be a lawyer.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.770
That's why I came to New York.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.829
Now I've spoiled everything.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.432
No, you haven't.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.500
I never should have let
Jonathan take me out after work.

10:12.578 --> 10:16.036
<i>- Jonathan's your boss? '
- Yeah. I thought it was okay, you know?</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:18.606
<i>I mean, he said
he wanted to help me.</i>

10:18.684 --> 10:21.278
If I knew that's what he wanted,
I never would have gone.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.949
- I'm so stupid.
- Now you listen to me.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.288
<i>You're not stupid and you haven't
done anything wrong.</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:29.954
Yeah, but I don't know how
to make him stop.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.192
Every time the phone rings,
my stomach turns into knots.

10:33.265 --> 10:36.496
I'm messing up at work. I never
know what he's gonna do next.

10:36.569 --> 10:40.130
My best friend says I should quit,
but I don't want to give up.

10:40.206 --> 10:44.006
<i>Tell you what. Let me finish up here and
we'll go have a cup of coffee and we can talk.</i>

10:44.076 --> 10:47.307
- I don't drink coffee.
- Okay, forget coffee. Root beer float.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.248
<i>Excuse me.
Could I get by, please?</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:53.683
Uh, I have to go.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.255
Annie?

10:57.323 --> 11:00.815
Where's Dr. Ruth going?
I'll be right back.

11:00.893 --> 11:04.761
<i>Annie? Annie.!</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:07.094
Wait a sec.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.259
<i>Annie.!</i>

11:10.636 --> 11:12.570
Annie!

11:12.638 --> 11:14.572
An-

11:15.574 --> 11:18.099
<i>Look out, lady. You crazy?</i>

11:21.080 --> 11:23.014
Taxi!

11:27.787 --> 11:30.585
<i>Hey, hey.! Taxi.!</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:34.922
<i>Taxi! Wait, taxi!</i>

11:34.994 --> 11:37.155
<i>That guy's deaf. He didn't
hear me. Take it easy.</i>

11:37.229 --> 11:39.891
Take it easy.
It's rush hour in midtown Manhattan.

11:39.965 --> 11:43.230
You'll never get a taxi.
Forget about it.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.930
All right. Okay. Al, I found
out her name. It's Annie Wilkins.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.269
<i>And she's in big trouble.</i>

11:48.340 --> 11:50.274
We don't know about that.
Look-

11:50.342 --> 11:52.902
No, the data on Annie Wilkins
is very sketchy.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.572
I gotta help her. She's in trouble.
No, you're the one that's in trouble.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.741
The odds on Doug and Debbie
getting back together...

11:57.817 --> 12:00.285
just slipped 12%.
What happened?

12:00.352 --> 12:03.287
They got in a fight about whose fault
it was the last time they broke up.

12:03.355 --> 12:06.722
That was the fourth time they broke up. Maybe if they
break up all the time they're not supposed to be together.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.420
No, Dr. Ruthie says they're perfect
for each other.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.895
"Ruthie"? They never fight
about anything serious.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.057
One time they'll fight
because she left the bathroom a mess.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.260
Another time they'll get in a fight
because he doesn't call her.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.463
Well, if Dr. Ruth is the expert,
then why isn't she here?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.665
Because I guess you can do
something that she can't-

12:21.741 --> 12:23.675
But that's hard for me to believe...

12:23.743 --> 12:26.439
because the last session that we
had together, Dr. Ruthie raised-

12:26.512 --> 12:28.946
Wait a second! Some very
important observations.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.948
Wait a second. I was very
- What?

12:31.016 --> 12:34.315
You're having counseling sessions with
Dr. Ruth while I'm stuck here in 1985?

12:34.386 --> 12:37.287
Lookit. Ziggy says you're here
to help Doug and Debbie.

12:37.356 --> 12:40.621
Unless you do something about that,
you're gonna stay stuck in 1985,

12:40.693 --> 12:43.093
wearing your silly high heels
and your stupid dresses...

12:43.162 --> 12:45.153
and talking to strangers
about G-spots.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.367
All right. All right. Look.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.926
Why did Doug and Debbie
break up? Which time?

12:52.004 --> 12:53.995
The last time.
Why don't you ask them?

12:54.073 --> 12:57.099
<i>Uh-
It was about sex.</i>

12:57.176 --> 12:59.440
Are you all right?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.174
- Just went down the wrong pipe.
- Mmm.

13:02.248 --> 13:05.217
His genitals and my orgasms.
That's all he wanted to talk about.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.616
<i>Yeah, well, that's pretty much
would, uh, cover everything.</i>

13:07.686 --> 13:10.621
Eh, have you decided
what you want to eat yet?

13:10.689 --> 13:12.623
You know, it's not like
I don't have them.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.682
The Caesar salad looks pretty good.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.024
<i>I have never faked one in my life.</i>

13:17.096 --> 13:20.554
Linguine, maybe. Linguine, yup.
That's what I'll have. Some linguine.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.897
Do you know that Doug
actually counted them?

13:22.968 --> 13:26.199
I mean, if I didn't have multiples,
forget it.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.399
What does he think sex is,
a football game?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.601
"And Bridges goes long. It's
between the uprights, and it's-

13:30.676 --> 13:33.236
"it's- it's a touchdown!

13:33.312 --> 13:35.337
And the crowd goes wild. "

13:35.414 --> 13:38.042
<i>Oh, you two talking about sports?</i>

13:38.117 --> 13:40.051
In a way.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.849
You didn't tell me this was
gonna be dinner for three.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.652
- She didn't tell me either.
- I thought this might be a nice opportunity...

13:45.724 --> 13:49.387
- to put our problems aside and have a nice, peaceful dinner together.
- Thank you.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.395
Fine-As long as it's strictly business.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.261
<i>Of course it's strictly business.
She made sure of that.</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:57.496
- I did not call off our relationship.
- Just a nice, peaceful dinner.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.539
- Then who did?
- He sabotaged it.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.234
<i>It sounds like you sabotage...</i>

14:03.309 --> 14:06.073
all your relationships with women.
No, I do not.

14:06.145 --> 14:09.740
Now-That fits, huh?
Is that better?

14:09.815 --> 14:12.807
Much better.
Okay. Also-

14:12.885 --> 14:15.649
We were able to reproduce
your eyeglasses.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.258
That's wonderful.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.557
<i>I didn't know how handsome you are.</i>

14:23.629 --> 14:26.120
Oh, well, you're
a very charming woman.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.257
<i>Speaking of women-</i>

14:28.334 --> 14:32.964
Let's get back to your relationship
with women.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.441
<i>Why do you think
that you were married five times?</i>

14:37.509 --> 14:39.875
I like variety.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.880
If you like variety,
you can do something about it.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.883
You don't have to change partners.

14:45.951 --> 14:48.442
You can experiment a little.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.954
<i>Experiment?
Yes.</i>

14:51.023 --> 14:53.116
I tell my clients...

14:53.192 --> 14:56.389
that they can have a drawer...

14:56.462 --> 14:58.657
full of toys.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.167
- Toys?
- Like a new video camera.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.397
<i>That could be lots of fun.</i>

15:10.142 --> 15:12.235
Do you have
one of those video cameras?

15:12.311 --> 15:14.472
We are not talking about me.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.707
We are talking about you.

15:16.782 --> 15:21.481
And I'm sorry to say,
I'm very disappointed in you, Al.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.350
You're disappointed in me?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.654
You say this is the future.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.092
<i>I thought by now people like you...</i>

15:30.162 --> 15:33.495
<i>would have a healthier attitude
towards sex.</i>

15:33.565 --> 15:35.499
I have a very healthy attitude
towards sex.

15:35.567 --> 15:39.628
<i>I think you have a problem.</i>

15:39.705 --> 15:42.196
With all due respect, Dr. Ruth,
when it comes to women,

15:42.274 --> 15:44.708
Al Calavicci doesn't have any problems.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.211
<i>I think you...</i>

15:47.279 --> 15:50.271
are afraid of something.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.840
You're right: Alimony.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.378
I think you are afraid...

15:58.457 --> 16:00.391
of being abandoned.

16:00.459 --> 16:04.225
- Baloney.
- You may not even be aware of it.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.561
You see, the fear of abandonment...

16:07.633 --> 16:09.863
<i>stems from something...</i>

16:09.935 --> 16:12.904
that happened in your childhood.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.941
When you were a child,

16:16.008 --> 16:18.238
did you ever feel abandoned?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.711
Well, I-
I was raised in an orphanage.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.238
Aha. You see?

16:25.317 --> 16:28.184
Now we are getting somewhere.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.517
<i>That's why we never get anywhere.</i>

16:30.589 --> 16:32.682
Every time we start to get close,
you pull away.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.852
- Not the last time.
- No. The last three times.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.419
Debbie, I gave you a ring.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.522
He gave you a ring?

16:40.599 --> 16:43.363
Of course he did. You
remember. I showed it to you.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.336
How would she remember? You
only wore it for three days.

16:49.775 --> 16:54.508
Oh! Cherries jubilee. Yumola.
Looks a little light on the brandy.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.174
Three days later you said
you had the jitters.

16:57.249 --> 16:59.217
<i>You stopped performing,
remember?</i>

16:59.284 --> 17:01.411
Oh, this sounds juicy.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.285
What do you mean by "performing"?
Do I have to spell it out for you?

17:04.356 --> 17:07.257
The cork on the champagne bottle
wouldn't pop.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.420
Uh-huh.
The thrusters weren't thrusting.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.260
Oh, really?
There was no liftoff.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.266
Could we change the subject?
No, please. Let her go ahead.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.564
There's a couple in the next room
who didn't hear about my thrusters.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.433
<i>Not so good, Sam.</i>

17:19.505 --> 17:22.702
What am I supposed to do? Get her a bullhorn.
She can announce it from the Chrysler Building.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.972
"Doug's rocket didn't launch. "
Well, do something.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.979
I think that the, uh-

17:28.047 --> 17:30.777
that the problem...

17:30.849 --> 17:32.783
Is that...

17:32.851 --> 17:35.581
<i>neither one of you want to commit.
That's not true.</i>

17:35.654 --> 17:38.919
- That's ridiculous.
- It's true. People who are afraid of commitment...

17:38.991 --> 17:41.551
are afraid because
they don't want to get hurt.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.618
<i>See, people abandon...</i>

17:43.695 --> 17:45.629
<i>a relationship...</i>

17:45.697 --> 17:47.688
Before the relationship
abandons them.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.564
<i>Uh, your mind is merging
with Dr. Ruth, you know.</i>

17:50.636 --> 17:52.604
I don't see what that has to do
with our relationship.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.434
You may not even be
aware of it.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.998
<i>Did you ever feel abandoned
as a child?</i>

17:58.077 --> 18:00.068
<i>That's exactly what she said to me.</i>

18:00.145 --> 18:03.842
I guess so.
Yeah, I guess I did too... a little.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.646
You did?
Yeah.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.652
Aha! Now we
are getting somewhere.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.654
She said that too.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.316
<i>I guess I've been insensitive.</i>

18:13.392 --> 18:15.383
I had no idea
you were so insecure.

18:15.461 --> 18:19.158
No, I'm the one who should have realized
there was a reason why you were so insecure.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.995
I'm not insecure.
Admit it.

18:22.067 --> 18:25.503
Things changed the second you moved in.
Oh, really? How did they change?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.436
<i>You turned into an ice princess.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.</i>

18:27.506 --> 18:29.997
I think we made enough progress
for one night here.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.067
I think we just slammed into
reverse. "An ice princess"?

18:33.145 --> 18:35.477
Come on. You made
the North Pole look like a tropical paradise.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.277
You-You bought flannel pajamas.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.341
I bought flannel pajamas
because you like to sleep...

18:40.419 --> 18:43.513
with the window open when it's
20 degrees outside. You know what?

18:43.589 --> 18:45.887
I don't know why we're fighting about
this, because it's water under the bridge.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.018
I'll water your bridge.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.961
Debbie. Debbie.
No, let her go.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.899
Geez.

18:54.967 --> 19:00.166
This may be hard for you to believe
right now, but she really loves you.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.037
Oh, yeah, right. No,
she does. It's just that-

19:03.108 --> 19:05.872
If she didn't care so much, she
wouldn't get that upset. I mean-

19:05.944 --> 19:09.209
See, the two of you need to get
together and talk about your feelings.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.647
That was the problem
with the '80s.

19:11.717 --> 19:15.209
You see we are living
in a very difficult time in history.

19:15.287 --> 19:17.585
Men's roles and women's roles
are changing.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.590
Dr. Ruth, I know you're trying to help,

19:19.658 --> 19:22.889
- but I-I think it's a lost cause.
- Not if you care, it's not.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.054
I do. L-I care about her. It's-

19:25.130 --> 19:28.361
I just- I met this other girl.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.231
<i>- Huh?
- Brenda Jacobs from the Christmas party. You remember?</i>

19:31.303 --> 19:33.897
<i>Uh-oh. Brenda.
Sounds like trouble.</i>

19:33.972 --> 19:36.167
She's a babe.
Yeah, and so is Debbie.

19:36.241 --> 19:39.733
<i>Brenda Jacobs-She does the news
for a station in Buffalo.</i>

19:39.811 --> 19:42.041
It's just-
Things are simpler with Brenda.

19:42.114 --> 19:45.174
- She keeps talking about the fact that we should run away together.
- Oh, no.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.241
I know.
I'm not taking her seriously or anything.

19:47.319 --> 19:52.120
- Oh, yes, he is. He runs off with her.
- You know, I'm impulsive. Not that impulsive.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.594
And it's a disaster, Sam. She marries him because
she thinks that he can do her career some good.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.960
<i>- Of course, it's very flattering.
- Then they divorce in six months,</i>

19:59.031 --> 20:01.124
- and she marries a game show host.
- What about Debbie?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.566
<i>She goes to work for a TVstation
- What about her?</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:06.126
And then, on her first assignment-

20:06.205 --> 20:09.606
<i>Oh, she blows it, Sam. She winds up
writing for some retirement newspaper.</i>

20:09.675 --> 20:13.907
Debbie is a very special person.
You can't let her get away from you.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.880
Dr. Ruth, I've told you.
We've tried everything.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.948
<i>Come on. We gotta get to the studio.</i>

20:21.019 --> 20:23.317
What for? It's Thursday night.
You do your promos, remember?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.948
Yeah. Let me get this bill here
and I'll be right with you.

20:26.024 --> 20:29.460
<i>All right. I'll get my coat.
Sam, you gotta keep working...</i>

20:29.528 --> 20:31.462
to get these lovebirds
back together.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.658
I'd stay with you,
but Dr. Ruth is expecting me.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.428
What?

20:36.501 --> 20:38.799
She says I'm on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.910
<i>Okay, let's try it again.</i>

20:53.485 --> 20:55.783
This is Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.118
<i>Tomorrow on Frank Talk About Sex,
we're going to discuss...</i>

20:58.190 --> 21:00.750
some common male
sexual dysfunctions-

21:00.826 --> 21:03.761
Like premature-

21:03.829 --> 21:05.763
premature e-

21:07.165 --> 21:10.896
Well, we're gonna discuss a lot of things
that I'm sure will be very stimulating.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.767
Uh, uplifting. Interesting.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.830
And that'll be tomorrow,

21:15.907 --> 21:18.876
right here on my show.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.935
<i>Uh, one more time.</i>

21:21.013 --> 21:23.140
No, I think that's enough of that one.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.849
<i>Not that one.
Mmm, not that one either.</i>

21:27.919 --> 21:30.410
<i>I got a call for you, Dr. Ruth.</i>

21:30.489 --> 21:34.448
<i>It's the girl who phoned in yesterday-
The, uh, one with the sex-crazed boss.</i>

21:34.526 --> 21:36.494
Yeah. Put her through.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.333
Hello?
Dr. Ruth?

21:42.401 --> 21:44.426
I'm so glad you're there.
What's wrong?

21:44.503 --> 21:47.336
I heard someone outside.
I think it's him.

21:47.406 --> 21:50.375
Call the police. I'm afraid to
hang up. Just talk to me, please.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.376
All right, Annie.
Where are you? Home.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.912
472 East 18th Street.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.813
All right. Listen to me. You gotta
hang up the phone and dial 911.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.579
No, I don't want to hang up.
I'm scared.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.677
He's gonna do something terrible.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.382
He called me into his office
after I got back from the bookstore,

22:05.457 --> 22:09.860
and he said he was gonna teach me a
lesson for talking to you. Okay, listen.

22:09.928 --> 22:12.920
Hang up the phone and call the police.
Do you hear me?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.865
Annie, do you hear me?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.502
<i>Ruth.! Dr. Ruth.</i>

22:24.576 --> 22:26.567
What-

22:30.582 --> 22:32.777
<i>Annie?</i>

22:35.554 --> 22:37.613
<i>Annie? Annie?</i>

22:39.758 --> 22:42.226
Open a window.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.228
Annie?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.491
Annie. Annie.

22:46.565 --> 22:49.966
I gotta get you some air.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.699
Easy. Okay.

22:54.773 --> 22:57.264
Take it easy now. Thank you.
We'll be fine. Thank you.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.742
All right. Just relax.
Get your head back.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.906
Get some air. Breathe easy.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.712
That's it. Easy.
What happened?

23:06.785 --> 23:09.049
Tell me everything that happened
from when you got home.

23:09.121 --> 23:12.579
Everything was fine. I mean, I was
still shaky from whatJonathan said,

23:12.657 --> 23:15.387
but I wasn't gonna let it
get to me.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.429
I changed my clothes,
and it was cold,

23:18.497 --> 23:21.159
so I decided to make some tea.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.301
And then, um-

23:24.369 --> 23:26.735
And then I heard something outside.

23:27.873 --> 23:31.775
- I know it was him.
- Did you call the police like I asked you to?

23:31.843 --> 23:35.609
No. I was going to, but then I
heard the door start to rattle,

23:35.680 --> 23:38.774
and I tried to find a place to hide,

23:38.850 --> 23:41.546
and then I-

23:41.620 --> 23:43.884
I don't remember.
I guess I fainted.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.889
Oh, no, you didn't faint.

23:45.957 --> 23:48.551
The gas from the stove
knocked you out.

23:48.627 --> 23:50.959
What, he turned on the gas?
Yeah. Yeah.

23:51.029 --> 23:54.226
Now look. Just take it easy.
Now I want you to think really hard.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.893
Are you absolutely, positively sure...

23:56.968 --> 23:59.562
that you lit the stove?

23:59.638 --> 24:02.539
Yes, of course I did.
I mean, I've never forgotten before.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.576
Yeah, but you said you heard
a noise and you were scared, right?

24:05.644 --> 24:07.578
So maybe you turned on the gas,

24:07.646 --> 24:10.615
but then you got distracted over here,
and then you never lit it.

24:10.682 --> 24:13.742
No, I know I lit it.
No, I remember throwing out the match.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.753
It has to be here.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.919
He took it. No, I know he did.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.928
He was here.

24:24.996 --> 24:28.090
You don't believe me, do you?
Sure, I do.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.191
The important thing is...

24:30.268 --> 24:32.259
that you get away
from this man.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.101
Okay? Before he hurts you
or you hurt yourself.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.609
How can I get away?
He's my boss.

24:38.677 --> 24:41.874
So what?
It's just a job. You quit.

24:41.947 --> 24:45.041
I can't. All right. All
right. You don't quit.

24:45.116 --> 24:49.052
We'll file a complaint
against this guy, all right?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.384
I don't know.
I do.

24:51.456 --> 24:54.550
Now what do you say? I'll help you
clean out your desk in the morning.

24:54.626 --> 24:57.220
Come on.

24:57.295 --> 25:01.755
Why would someone as famous as you
care about someone like me?

25:04.803 --> 25:08.398
How do you think I got
to be so famous? Hmm.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.634
Besides,

25:10.709 --> 25:12.939
helping people is what
I do for a living.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.913
<i>Believe me, Al,
with your kind of problems,</i>

25:16.982 --> 25:20.247
you need lots of help. I thought
we already solved my problems.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.879
We identified your basic fear
of abandonment.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.423
Now we have to work...

25:26.491 --> 25:30.427
on getting you in touch
with your feelings,

25:30.495 --> 25:32.429
and verbalizing them.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.727
We need to open you up.

25:34.799 --> 25:38.235
Oh, but I'm-
I'm a very open person,

25:38.303 --> 25:41.067
with-with verbal feelings.

25:41.139 --> 25:44.404
Well, then, tell me
about your girlfriend.

25:47.946 --> 25:50.710
Well, uh, her name is Tina.
Mm-hmm.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.773
So tell me more.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.785
More about Tina?
Mm-hmm.

25:54.853 --> 25:57.617
Uh, well, um-

25:57.689 --> 26:00.055
Oh, well.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.719
She's got...

26:02.794 --> 26:05.285
great... casabas.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.763
What are these casabas?

26:07.832 --> 26:09.766
Well, you know.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.768
Melons.
Hmm?

26:11.836 --> 26:16.500
Hoo-has? Honkers? Hooters?
Headlights?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.510
Uh, ta-tas?

26:19.578 --> 26:23.014
Teeters? Tweeters?
Tom-toms? Tetons?

26:23.081 --> 26:26.949
Say it. I'm trying to say
it. Uh, meatballs. Mangoes.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.509
Cream pies. Cupcakes?

26:29.588 --> 26:32.751
Uh, bangers? Bouncers? Bulumbas?

26:32.824 --> 26:36.089
Al-
Bazongas?

26:36.161 --> 26:39.494
Breasts! I said it.

26:39.564 --> 26:42.692
You see? It wasn't that hard.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.292
Yes, it was.
So how is your sex life...

26:45.370 --> 26:47.304
with Tina?

26:47.372 --> 26:50.364
That's a very personal question.

26:50.442 --> 26:56.142
Not for an open person like you.
Ehh-

26:58.783 --> 27:02.219
I finally feel free.
Thank you for coming with me.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.221
The best way you can thank me
is by promising...

27:04.289 --> 27:06.382
you'll file a complaint as soon
as you get to a new job.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.392
<i>Yeah.
Newjob?</i>

27:08.460 --> 27:11.122
Annie? What's going on?

27:11.196 --> 27:14.359
Uh, well, I turned in
my resignation.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.765
I, uh- I quit.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.566
You-
How can you do this to me?

27:20.639 --> 27:24.905
How am I supposed to find a
substitute for you at this late notice?

27:24.976 --> 27:27.137
I don't know.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.910
Cab's waiting.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.007
You go ahead.

27:33.084 --> 27:36.451
No, you go on. I'll talk
to you in a little while.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.257
Excuse me.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.385
You are Dr. Ruth Westheimer,
aren't you? I love your show.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.897
You must be Annie's boss.
How do you know Annie?

27:46.965 --> 27:51.026
Because she came to me for advice, because
you've been sexually harassing her on the job.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.400
You're joking, aren't you?

27:53.471 --> 27:55.701
This is not a joking matter,
Mr. Holmby.

27:55.774 --> 27:59.505
Annie's not going to file a complaint because
she's afraid of what might happen to her career,

27:59.577 --> 28:02.375
but someday, someone's not
gonna roll over that easy.

28:02.447 --> 28:04.881
Come on, Anita.
Anita.

28:04.949 --> 28:10.012
Listen. I don't know what she told you,
but you've got this all backwards.

28:10.088 --> 28:12.716
- I don't think so.
- Annie's a sweet kid.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.692
I took her out for a drink once or twice,
just to be nice.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.024
<i>Yeah, well, maybe you were a
little bit too nice. Oh, no, no.</i>

28:18.096 --> 28:22.089
I treated her just like she was one of
the other guys. She got the wrong idea.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.365
- She thought we were an item.
- That's not what she told me.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.930
Yeah, of course it isn't.
When I tried to let her down easy, it got ugly.

28:30.008 --> 28:33.774
She went crazy. She kept calling me,
usually in the middle of the night.

28:33.845 --> 28:36.746
It got so bad I finally had
to change my phone number.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.875
You can check with the phone company
about that.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.112
But Annie said you've been
following her around.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.281
<i>In fact, she was sure that she
saw you yesterday at the bookstore.</i>

28:45.356 --> 28:48.484
I was buying a birthday card
for my wife.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.494
You can check that out too.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.429
Dr. Ruth,
I'm a happily married man.

28:53.498 --> 28:57.332
<i>I don't know. Maybe drawing
you into this fantasy ofhers...</i>

28:57.402 --> 28:59.336
<i>is the best thing
that could have happened,</i>

28:59.404 --> 29:01.770
'cause I have tried and tried
to get through to her,

29:01.840 --> 29:04.331
but it obviously hasn't helped.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.900
<i>Annie's a good kid.
She's talented too.</i>

29:06.978 --> 29:09.742
But this is getting out of hand.

29:11.449 --> 29:14.009
<i>Here. Uh-</i>

29:14.085 --> 29:16.815
If I can help,
give me a call.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.879
Nice meeting you.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.933
<i>You're on the air.</i>

29:30.001 --> 29:34.233
<i>Hi, Dr. Ruth.
This is Teri from Forest Hills.</i>

29:34.305 --> 29:36.967
<i>I'm calling 'cause I feel inadequate.</i>

29:37.041 --> 29:40.374
And why do you feel inadequate, Teri?

29:40.445 --> 29:43.903
<i>Well, I'm built like a boy.
I'm completely flat-chested.</i>

29:43.982 --> 29:46.974
<i>I've been thinking
about getting breast implants.</i>

29:48.353 --> 29:50.344
Well, you know,

29:50.421 --> 29:52.548
Teri, all the evidence isn't in yet...

29:52.624 --> 29:55.252
about the safety of implants.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.590
<i>Well, my doctor says
they're perfectly safe.</i>

29:57.662 --> 30:00.187
<i>They use silicone.</i>

30:00.265 --> 30:02.733
Well, silicone has done
a lot of good things,

30:02.801 --> 30:05.269
and it's been used for a lot
of good things,

30:05.336 --> 30:08.794
and things that have benefited
modern medicine,

30:08.873 --> 30:10.898
but liquid silicone can leak,

30:10.975 --> 30:14.502
and in some cases it can cause
severe side-effects.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.513
Where is she
coming up with this?

30:16.581 --> 30:18.845
<i>But my boyfriend says
I'm not sexy.</i>

30:18.917 --> 30:21.477
Well, you know, Teri,

30:21.553 --> 30:24.283
being sexy is a state of mind.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.880
It's your body, you know,

30:26.958 --> 30:30.758
<i>not his,
so you do what's-</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:32.956
Right for you.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.329
<i>Promise me you'll think it over?
I promise.</i>

30:35.400 --> 30:37.527
<i>Good.
Good advice from Dr. Ruth.</i>

30:37.602 --> 30:41.368
<i>We'll be right back after this
short break for News at 9:00,</i>

30:41.439 --> 30:43.430
<i>so don't go away.
That was very good.</i>

30:43.508 --> 30:47.501
You just convinced 421 women not to have implants
that would have given them adverse reactions.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.513
<i>Doctor, you can take five...</i>

30:49.581 --> 30:51.913
<i>while we run commercials
and some P.S.A.s.</i>

30:51.983 --> 30:53.917
That's very good.
Al?

30:53.985 --> 30:55.919
Yeah?
Maybe this is it.

30:55.987 --> 31:00.083
Maybe what is what is what? Maybe,
because I've been so embarrassed, you know?

31:00.158 --> 31:02.922
About talking about sex and having
to do it on the radio and everything,

31:02.994 --> 31:06.088
that I haven't really realized
all the good that I could do.

31:06.164 --> 31:09.759
I mean, think about this. People
really listen to Dr. Ruth, right?

31:09.834 --> 31:13.099
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, maybe I could
do something about teenage pregnancy.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.731
Maybe I could slow down the
spread of Al DS. Maybe I could-

31:15.807 --> 31:17.741
Sam
- Just think about it for a second, Al.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.437
Wait a second.
You're not here to save the world.

31:20.511 --> 31:22.502
You're here to help some people.

31:22.580 --> 31:25.447
You already changed Annie's life
by getting her to quit the job,

31:25.516 --> 31:28.974
but now you gotta do something to help Doug
and Debbie. But maybe this leap is different.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.613
<i>Are you worried about drunk drivers?</i>

31:31.689 --> 31:33.418
<i>Mothers Against Drunk Driving
is having...</i>

31:33.491 --> 31:35.789
<i>an information meeting at Saint Sebastian's
- I know we're not speaking,</i>

31:35.860 --> 31:38.158
but, uh, could you take
a look at this?

31:41.132 --> 31:43.259
We've gotta talk to her.

31:47.472 --> 31:51.568
I mean, think of what I could do. Yeah, you
could throw Dr. Ruthie right into the loony bin...

31:51.643 --> 31:54.407
by acting crazy.
But I'm not gonna act crazy.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.004
<i>Dr. Ruth? Are you all right?</i>

31:57.081 --> 31:59.015
Good-bye radio.
Hello, Bellevue.

31:59.083 --> 32:03.281
Of course. L-I'm fine.
I was just, uh, practicing.

32:03.354 --> 32:07.290
<i>Because, you know, sometimes I
have trouble pronouncing things.</i>

32:07.358 --> 32:09.588
- We're worried about you.
- Oh-

32:09.661 --> 32:12.255
<i>Doug told me what happened last night
when you went charging out ofhere.</i>

32:12.330 --> 32:15.163
And then there was that incident
at the bookstore.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.428
Oh, well, that was just, uh,
a case of me...

32:17.502 --> 32:20.335
seeing somebody stealing a book
and wanting to catch them.

32:21.572 --> 32:24.973
<i>Because it was a big book-
an expensive, big book-</i>

32:25.043 --> 32:28.012
<i>like an encyclopaedia,
kind of.</i>

32:28.079 --> 32:30.274
They're preparing your padded cell
even as we speak.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.373
<i>You know, you really haven't
been acting like yourself...</i>

32:32.450 --> 32:34.384
<i>for the last day or two.
Yeah,</i>

32:34.452 --> 32:38.388
well
- Hey, look. They're talking to each other at least.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.857
<i>Now's a good chance
to go and try a reconciliation.</i>

32:41.926 --> 32:44.895
You're right.
I have been very upset.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.897
Is it something Doug did?
What?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.024
No. It's something
you both did.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.295
Me? Us? That's right.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.803
No matter what either of you say, you
both care for each other a great deal.

32:53.871 --> 32:57.136
Now, I want you to apologize for the
way you've been treating each other.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.676
- Good. You're making progress.
- Go on. I want you to both apologize.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.735
I don't need an apologize-
It really isn't necessary-

33:01.813 --> 33:04.714
Apologize. Go on.
Douglas, you first. Go.

33:04.782 --> 33:08.183
Okay. Um, I'm sorry.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.215
For what?

33:13.491 --> 33:17.188
For acting like an idiot.
I, uh- It's been all my fault.

33:17.261 --> 33:20.162
- No, no, it isn't. It's my fault.
- Would you let me finish my apology?

33:20.231 --> 33:23.928
<i>- Sorry. Go ahead.
- Their odds of getting back together...</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:25.993
<i>have gone up six percent.
I know this sounds crazy,</i>

33:26.070 --> 33:28.595
but maybe we could, uh,
forget about what happened before...

33:28.673 --> 33:30.607
and start over.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.939
<i>Would you be willing to do that?</i>

33:33.011 --> 33:35.070
I would if you would.

33:35.146 --> 33:39.344
<i>- This is wonderful. Keep going.
Doug, there's a call on line eight.</i>

33:39.417 --> 33:43.353
<i>Someone named Brenda.
She says she's a friend of yours.</i>

33:43.421 --> 33:46.879
Brenda? Not Brenda Jacobs,
the bimbo from the Christmas party?

33:46.958 --> 33:50.018
- Uh-oh. - Could you tell her
I'll call her back, please?

33:50.094 --> 33:54.121
<i>You told me you weren't seeing
that little tramp anymore.</i>

33:54.198 --> 33:58.259
<i>- H-He's not. Tell her. - I'm not seeing
the little tramp- her, Brenda-anymore.</i>

33:58.336 --> 34:00.600
- Then why is she calling you?
- I don't know, Debbie.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.696
Just because somebody's calling me
doesn't mean I'm seeing them.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.605
- Well, what does it mean then?
- Well, it-

34:04.675 --> 34:06.609
<i>You're on the air in 60 seconds.</i>

34:09.880 --> 34:12.748
<i>Sam, we got problems. Big problems.</i>

34:12.817 --> 34:15.308
I know. No, you don't.
Forget about Doug and Debbie.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.047
<i>- It's Annie. She's in trouble.
- You're on the air in 30 seconds.</i>

34:18.121 --> 34:21.250
<i>You told me I changed her life.</i>

34:21.324 --> 34:24.089
You did. You changed history,
but now, according to Ziggy,

34:24.161 --> 34:27.893
Annie dies sometime
in the next two hours.

34:31.168 --> 34:34.797
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.708
<i>Five, four,</i>

34:39.777 --> 34:41.972
<i>three, two-</i>

34:42.045 --> 34:47.382
<i>Hi. We're back with Frank Socks
- Frank Talk About Sex. Uh, the doctor is in.</i>

34:47.452 --> 34:50.387
Sam, come on. We gotta
get out of here. I know.

34:50.455 --> 34:53.322
<i>We have a caller on the line who
has a question about erogenous zones.</i>

34:54.792 --> 34:57.226
I think instead maybe, uh,

34:57.295 --> 35:00.264
they'd like to hear
from you, Douglas.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.265
<i>Sam, what are you doing?</i>

35:02.333 --> 35:05.928
You really don't want to hear
about my erogenous zones. Do you?

35:06.003 --> 35:08.904
Well, maybe our listeners
would like to hear about your-

35:08.973 --> 35:11.100
Relationship with Debbie.

35:11.175 --> 35:12.836
- What? -
What? - What?

35:12.910 --> 35:15.242
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have in our studio today...

35:15.313 --> 35:19.682
two young, successful people
who are very much in love.

35:19.750 --> 35:23.584
<i>But they can't seem
to make things work out...</i>

35:23.654 --> 35:26.623
because they don't know
how to communicate.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.159
I don't know who's doing the talking here,
you or Dr. Ruth.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.320
- I don't either.
- Gimme that.

35:31.395 --> 35:34.057
That is not true.
My communication skills are excellent.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.100
Yeah, for a pit bull.
Excuse me?

35:36.167 --> 35:38.795
The only time we communicate
is when you're chewing me out.

35:38.870 --> 35:42.704
<i>Let's hear what our callers think.
Uh, put a caller through, please.</i>

35:42.773 --> 35:44.707
You are exaggerating,
and I hate when you do that.

35:44.775 --> 35:47.539
I said, put a caller on, please.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.546
<i>This is Gladys, from White Plains.</i>

35:49.614 --> 35:52.481
<i>It sounds to me like Doug needs
positive strokes from Debbie.</i>

35:52.550 --> 35:56.077
<i>Debbie, can you think of
something nice to say to Douglas?</i>

35:56.154 --> 35:58.714
<i>Debbie?
I like his tie.</i>

35:58.789 --> 36:00.757
<i>Try harder, Debbie.</i>

36:00.825 --> 36:04.591
Sam, have you forgotten
Annie Wilkins?

36:04.662 --> 36:07.859
I know your mind is merging with
Dr. Ruth, but try to remember-

36:07.932 --> 36:11.060
Annie Wilkins. She's gonna die in two
hours, remember? I remember. I remember.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.296
Okay, look.
Uh, you go check on her, Al.

36:13.371 --> 36:17.205
If this all works out, I'll be out
of here in five minutes. You got it.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.245
Oh. So how is everything
going, sweetie?

36:22.313 --> 36:25.771
Well, you seem cheery. That's good.
Don't let that creep get you down.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.375
<i>Don't answer that.</i>

36:28.452 --> 36:31.182
Finish writing what you're writing there.
Don't answer it!

36:31.255 --> 36:33.621
Hello, Annie.

36:35.993 --> 36:38.086
We have to talk.
No.

36:38.162 --> 36:41.427
<i>Douglas, I want you to tell us
how you feel about Debbie.</i>

36:41.499 --> 36:44.764
It doesn't matter. She doesn't care. Why
should I care when you're seeing someone else?

36:44.835 --> 36:47.360
<i>He's not seeing someone else.</i>

36:47.438 --> 36:52.068
The only reason he went out with Brenda
was because you dumped him.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.077
I didn't dump him.

36:54.145 --> 36:58.047
Okay, I guess I did.
I was afraid.

36:58.115 --> 37:01.107
I was afraid he'd back out,
so I backed out first.

37:01.185 --> 37:04.484
That's why I backed out the
last time. The last three times?

37:04.555 --> 37:06.546
Yeah.

37:06.624 --> 37:10.219
<i>Douglas, tell her
how you feel about her.</i>

37:10.294 --> 37:13.092
Right now, time for the truth.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.326
I'm crazy about you.

37:17.401 --> 37:21.633
I always have been. I want to
spend the rest of my life with you.

37:21.706 --> 37:25.073
<i>I'm crazy about you too.
I think I wanna cry.</i>

37:25.142 --> 37:27.474
<i>This is better than the soaps.</i>

37:29.880 --> 37:31.973
You're not just saying this?
No!

37:32.049 --> 37:33.914
Are you?
Of course not.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.977
<i>Oh, honey, he means it.
This is wonderful.</i>

37:37.054 --> 37:40.182
<i>Let's talk about the future.
Have you thought about kids?</i>

37:40.258 --> 37:43.694
<i>Well, somebody better tell Brenda.</i>

37:43.761 --> 37:45.956
You have such a pretty face.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.828
So soft.
Stop it.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.163
Admit it. You tried every trick in
the book to get me to notice you.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.169
This is crazy.
You bet it is.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.865
Come on, Annie.
Don't play hard to get.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.170
I know what you want.

37:58.242 --> 38:01.837
I can see it in your eyes.
Sam, where the hell are you?

38:01.912 --> 38:04.176
<i>- Don't come any closer.
- Put that down.</i>

38:04.248 --> 38:07.274
- Put it down.
- You really are a little tease, aren't you? Come on.

38:07.351 --> 38:10.184
Hand it to me. Come on.

38:13.758 --> 38:16.522
<i>That wasn't nice.
Then get out ofhere...</i>

38:16.594 --> 38:19.188
- or I'll do it again.
- All right. Okay.

38:19.263 --> 38:22.528
I'm going, all right?
Go.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.366
Oh! Oh, no!

38:26.437 --> 38:28.371
No!

38:28.439 --> 38:31.340
Gooshie, center me on Sam!

38:31.409 --> 38:35.311
<i>What's going on here?</i>

38:35.379 --> 38:37.904
<i>- Isn't there another way around this?
- Wait till you hear this one.</i>

38:37.982 --> 38:41.713
My wife insists on doing the deed
at the stroke of midnight.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.720
<i>I can't stay awake that long.</i>

38:43.788 --> 38:46.985
Sam, that pervert's got Annie.
Come on. You can't just sit here.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.925
<i>You got any better ideas?
I keep telling her it's genetic.</i>

38:49.994 --> 38:51.985
I mean, my pop would nod off...

38:52.063 --> 38:55.658
<i>every night at 7:00 for 45 years.
What's it like up ahead?</i>

38:55.733 --> 38:58.668
- Gridlock.
- Clear to 42nd Street.

38:58.736 --> 39:00.670
All right. I'm out of here.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.797
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What shall I tell my wife?

39:02.873 --> 39:07.071
Tell your wife that...
the early bird catches the worm.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.907
<i>Come on.!</i>

39:08.979 --> 39:11.539
<i>Dr. Ruth, uh-</i>

39:11.615 --> 39:13.583
<i>Wait.</i>

39:13.651 --> 39:16.586
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.020
Keep the shoes.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.024
Sam, hurry up!
Which is the quickest way?

39:21.092 --> 39:23.253
That way!

39:30.534 --> 39:32.695
<i>What's going on?</i>

39:32.770 --> 39:35.830
<i>Are you crazy?
What are you doing?</i>

39:38.509 --> 39:41.034
<i>Hey.!</i>

39:44.548 --> 39:46.914
I love strong women.

39:49.353 --> 39:52.015
Listen to me, all right?

39:52.089 --> 39:54.887
You stop now,
or I'm gonna call your wife.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.257
I'm gonna call your wife,
and I'm gonna tell her everything.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.592
<i>She already knows.</i>

39:59.663 --> 40:03.064
Oh, no!
Tell me you want it.

40:03.134 --> 40:06.001
<i>Tell me you want it!
Aah!</i>

40:09.206 --> 40:11.299
Annie!

40:11.375 --> 40:13.240
- No!
- Open the door, Annie!

40:22.019 --> 40:24.647
<i>Annie, you can stop playing games now.</i>

40:24.722 --> 40:27.987
<i>Annie, you can let me in,
or I'll let myself in.</i>

40:28.058 --> 40:30.526
No! Please go away!

40:32.630 --> 40:34.621
Oh, no! Please go.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.791
No, the fun's just starting,
sweetheart.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.233
<i>Annie?
Oh!</i>

40:39.303 --> 40:42.397
I'm here. Annie, what's the
matter with you? Stop it!

40:45.242 --> 40:47.506
- Annie?
- Thank God someone's here.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.172
<i>I didn't think
I could control her.</i>

40:50.247 --> 40:51.976
- I didn't want to hurt her.
- What a liar.

40:52.049 --> 40:54.347
- What happened?
- He tried to rape her, that's what happened.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.477
<i>She called. She said she kill herself
if I didn't come here.</i>

40:56.554 --> 40:58.954
<i>No. That's a lie.
You bet it is.</i>

40:59.023 --> 41:01.184
<i>When I said I wouldn't leave my wife,
she went crazy.</i>

41:01.258 --> 41:03.783
She came after me
with a kitchen knife.

41:03.861 --> 41:06.955
- How did her blouse get torn?
- I got the knife away from her, but came she after me.

41:07.031 --> 41:09.261
Look. Look what she did
to my hand.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.825
<i>The police are gonna have to take a
look at this. Oh, no. Listen. I, uh-</i>

41:12.903 --> 41:14.871
I won't press charges-

41:14.939 --> 41:16.873
<i>You okay?
If she promises...</i>

41:16.941 --> 41:19.000
Go call the police. There's
no need for the police.

41:19.076 --> 41:22.102
You're not going anywhere till the police
get here. Who the hell do you think you are?

41:22.179 --> 41:24.147
<i>He's not who you think he is.</i>

41:34.959 --> 41:37.792
- Good flip and kick, Sam.
- Did the job.

41:37.862 --> 41:39.887
Ziggy's now saying
that Annie-

41:39.964 --> 41:42.398
She goes to law school
and becomes an attorney,

41:42.466 --> 41:46.402
and she's a pioneer in the field of sexual
harassment. What about Doug and Debbie?

41:46.470 --> 41:50.907
They're broadcasting their wedding
ceremony even as we speak. How about that?

41:50.975 --> 41:52.909
<i>Unbelievable. Okay, the
police are on their way.</i>

41:52.977 --> 41:55.741
Dr. Ruth, wh-what happened?

41:55.813 --> 41:57.747
He, uh-

41:57.815 --> 41:59.874
He must have tripped.
He tripped.

41:59.950 --> 42:03.317
He's not gonna bother
you anymore. Thank you.

42:03.387 --> 42:05.446
Thank you so much.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.616
I'll never forget you.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.625
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.
Annie?</i>

42:09.693 --> 42:11.627
<i>Annie, what's going on
in there?</i>

42:11.695 --> 42:13.629
Yeah, go ahead.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.499
<i>It's all right, Mrs. Livingstone.</i>

42:18.569 --> 42:20.594
So?

42:20.671 --> 42:22.798
So?
Well, so?

42:22.873 --> 42:24.807
Well, so? So what?

42:24.875 --> 42:26.968
Why haven't you leaped? Why
haven't I leaped? Exactly.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.069
I don't know. I have no idea.
Well, ask Ziggy.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.444
Oh.

42:31.515 --> 42:33.449
Uh, hey.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.451
This has never happened before.

42:35.519 --> 42:37.612
What's never happened before?
Well, Ziggy says...

42:37.688 --> 42:40.282
the reason
you haven't leaped is... me.

42:40.357 --> 42:42.291
I don't believe that.
Neither do I.

42:42.359 --> 42:45.419
Ziggy says the reason
you leaped into Dr. Ruth...

42:45.496 --> 42:48.932
- was so that she could meet me in the future.
- What for?

42:48.999 --> 42:51.797
<i>I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?</i>

42:51.869 --> 42:53.803
I don't know how I feel.

42:53.871 --> 42:57.034
You've been going out
for how long now?

42:57.107 --> 42:59.200
Four years?

42:59.276 --> 43:01.210
Give or take a couple of months.

43:01.278 --> 43:03.439
Yeah. Tina's crazy about me.

43:03.514 --> 43:06.915
And you are crazy about her, aren't
you? Well, no, I wouldn't say that-

43:06.984 --> 43:09.009
I- I'd say I- I like her.

43:09.086 --> 43:12.522
<i>You just like her?
I like her a lot. A lot.</i>

43:12.590 --> 43:15.491
Does that mean you love her?

43:15.559 --> 43:18.084
Uh-

43:18.162 --> 43:21.256
It may have four letters,
but "love" is not a dirty word.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.857
<i>Say it.
Uh,</i>

43:23.934 --> 43:26.528
- I can't.
- Why not?

43:31.008 --> 43:33.033
I said it once, long ago,

43:33.110 --> 43:35.340
and once is enough.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.973
That must have been
one special love.

43:39.049 --> 43:41.142
It was.
So special...

43:41.218 --> 43:45.120
you could never love
anyone else?

43:45.189 --> 43:48.386
Not like that.
Of course, not like that.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.622
Who is asking you
to love everyone the same?

43:51.695 --> 43:54.664
People are different-
unique-

43:54.732 --> 43:59.226
so why shouldn't our love
for them be different?

43:59.303 --> 44:01.601
This person you loved-

44:01.672 --> 44:04.072
It was my...

44:04.141 --> 44:07.042
first wife, Beth.

44:07.111 --> 44:11.241
Did you love this Beth
more than you love Tina?

44:11.315 --> 44:14.876
Yes. But it was different.

44:14.952 --> 44:18.888
So you love Tina different
than Beth,

44:18.956 --> 44:20.890
but you still love her?

44:20.958 --> 44:24.052
Yes.
Did you hear...

44:24.128 --> 44:26.494
what you just said?

44:27.564 --> 44:30.692
I said, I love Tina different-
I said it.

44:31.835 --> 44:35.999
Maybe I tricked you into it,
but you said it.

44:36.073 --> 44:38.064
Now say it again,

44:38.142 --> 44:40.440
and drop the "different" part.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.071
That's a given.

44:44.982 --> 44:47.883
I love Tina.
Now go tell her.

44:47.951 --> 44:50.476
Okay. Gee, thanks, Doc.

44:59.229 --> 45:01.823
