on you. You're blacklisted.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.147
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

a replacement, Simon.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.788

told you he had nothing
to do with burning you.

each other.

on the record about

on this list forever.

[ Michael Narrating ]
When a soldier loses
a friend in battle,

01:51.579 --> 01:55.349
his commanding officer keeps
a close eye on how he copes.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.752
If his judgment is affected,
he's removed from combat...

01:58.819 --> 02:02.656
so one fallen soldier
doesn't turn into two.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.559
Spies in the field
take the same precautions.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.027
But without a strict
chain of command,

02:08.095 --> 02:12.400
the decision about who stays
in the game and who gets
sidelined can get messy.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.169
Brennen just called me.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.605
He wants me to meet him
at the Carlito in an hour.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.307
Great. I'll go with you,
just in case.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.808
Sam, if Brennen
wanted to kill me,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.843
he would have shot me
when he took the NOC list.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.479
I'm just gonna go
talk to the man.
Yeah. And I'm going.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.281
Yeah, I'd like
a word with him too.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.082
Mike, that's not
a good idea.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.986
Excuse me?
Sam, you got something to say,
you better say it to me.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.523
Look, I know you're upset,
but I don't think
you get it.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.459
Brennen isn't just
some arms dealer.
He kidnapped Mike's brother.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.861
He once strapped
a bomb to a kid.
The guy's a mega-creep.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.231
Look, I don't give a damn
if he's Satan himself.
All right?

02:43.297 --> 02:45.833
One way or another,
he's gonna tell me
how he got Marv to flip.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.869
No, he's not, Jesse.
Sam's right. You're
gonna sit this one out.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.240
The hell I am.
Mike, it's not your call.
Marv wasn't your friend.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.141
You're right. He wasn't.
But if he had been,

02:54.208 --> 02:57.044
I'd expect you to stop me
from doing something stupid.

He's right, Jess.
We've all been there--
Mike included.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.784
There's gonna be fallout
from Marv's murder.

here in Miami-- CIFA's

So I'm supposed to just
sit on the sidelines...

and lie to the only
people that are looking
for the truth?

Okay. That sounds like
a Michael Westen plan to me.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.530
No, actually,
I should be thanking you.

Because you led me
to good old Marv.

would have been able to pry
the list out of your hands.

from them.

So we're both keeping him
very comfortable until...

20:29.962 --> 20:32.799
an opportunity
presents itself, right?
[ Horn Honking ]

20:32.865 --> 20:33.900
Right.
Yeah.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.969

[ Shutter Clicking ]

20:41.441 --> 20:44.344
[ Clicking Continues ]

20:44.411 --> 20:46.245
[ Larry ]
There's our target.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.517
What? For kidnapping.
[ Laughs ]

20:56.055 --> 20:59.191
He didn't spare
any expense
on his security.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.493
[ Shutter Clicking ]

21:00.560 --> 21:02.962
Those bodyguards--
they got Ranger tats.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.298
[ Beeping ]
Probably former
Special Forces.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.301
Maybe we should just clip
one or two of them,
see how special they really are.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.702
[ Laughs ]

21:09.769 --> 21:13.172
Hey. You wanted to know
when Machado got here.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.575
He just got here.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.678
We'll be there.
[ Beeps ]

21:18.745 --> 21:22.081
Brennen?
Yeah, he wants to meet.
Wants to hear our plan.

21:22.148 --> 21:25.685
So, remember--
very comfortable.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.254
[ Michael ]
The entire compound...

21:28.321 --> 21:31.324
is surrounded by
an eight-foot wrought iron
and concrete fence.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.426
It's patrolled by
at least seven armed guards.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.628
A large explosion right here
by the front gate...

21:35.695 --> 21:37.530
will draw attention
in the wrong direction...

21:37.597 --> 21:39.799
and allow us to sneak in
through the rear wall.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.901
What about these
ugly little boxes?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.270
They supposed to be
motion sensors, video cameras?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.739
Oh, they're both,
but we're gonna knock out
the compound's power.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.476
Then they'll be running blind
until the generator starts up.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.645
From the moment we breach,
we'll have two minutes
to locate Machado,

21:52.712 --> 21:55.114
grab him and get him out
before the power
comes back up.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.616
It's gonna be tight.
[ Chuckles ]

21:56.683 --> 22:00.219
But I gotta say, fellas,
I love the simplicity.

22:00.286 --> 22:03.390
Make 'em look left,
stab 'em in the eyes,
go in right.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.991
- It's like a magic trick.
- Yeah.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.594
Like one of those
really bloody magic tricks.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.530
Yeah, I'd prefer not to be
the one bleeding.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.733
Seven guards
is a lot of moving parts
to account for.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.636
And we can't exactly
extract Machado
if we're dead.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.372
The kid thinks
we need to watch
some guard shift changes...

22:19.439 --> 22:23.309
to find the best time
to breach, minimize
our chances of being seen.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.979
Really? How long
do you think we'd need to
watch these shift changes?

22:27.046 --> 22:30.349
I'm thinking one,
maybe two days.
Yeah.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.218
Yeah, I can see that.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.220
You want one or two
days to scout.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.488
Yeah.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.424
Which would also
conveniently give you...

22:37.490 --> 22:39.692
one or two days to try
and come up with a plan...

22:39.759 --> 22:41.461
to wriggle out
from under my thumb.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.129
That about the shape
of it, Westen?
Brennen, I--

22:43.195 --> 22:46.899

Why don't both you ladies
put on your game faces
right now,

22:50.737 --> 22:54.574
because you're
going in right now.

[ Mouths Words ]

23:05.585 --> 23:07.319
Peanut butter, jelly.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.090
Now make me a sandwich
delicious enough to blast
into that compound...

23:11.157 --> 23:15.094
and blame the Philippine
separatist group for the
kidnapping of Albert Machado.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.531
Going now is a mistake.
We haven't taken the time
we need to prep.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.067
Well, what do you think
Larry's doing, window shopping?

23:21.133 --> 23:23.436
He's at the compound,
finishing your recon.

not exactly worried
about our well-being, but--

my number-one priority,
which is why...

Don't flash those adorable
puppy dog eyes at me.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.924
What happened to that plan
I liked so much?

23:44.991 --> 23:47.560
If you want us around
for a second operation,

23:47.627 --> 23:49.261
I'm telling you
to reconsider.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.865
And I'm telling you,
two elite operatives
like yourselves--

23:52.932 --> 23:54.400
you'll be fine.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.604
And you can take solace
in the fact that you
don't have a choice.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.841
Oh, don't tell me the kid's
still moping around.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.110
Every moment
since you left.
What do you got?

24:04.176 --> 24:06.445
Okay, the main power
from Machado's compound...

24:06.513 --> 24:08.615
is run off a transformer
a quarter mile north.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.551
That's perfect. You can
drop a charge off there
on your way to the breach.

24:11.618 --> 24:15.387
Yeah. Machado is
in his office right now,
at the back of the main house.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.491
We can separate him from
his guards and then force him
outside, snatch him--

24:18.558 --> 24:20.326
Shouldn't be
any problem.
Love it.

24:20.392 --> 24:24.363
Now, before you go in,
you gotta make these
bombs exactly like this.

Exactly. Do not deviate.

some guys in Manila,
but I don't read Tagalog.

under "your problem."

to send the bill.

[ Michael Narrating ]
If you're looking to frame
a specific group for a bombing,

24:49.021 --> 24:52.458
you use their design plans,
their construction materials...

24:52.525 --> 24:54.627
and their particular
brand of C-4.

24:54.694 --> 24:58.531
Bomb experts know
that not all C-4 is the same.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.099
The same taggant chemicals...

25:00.166 --> 25:03.069
that allow manufacturers
to identify their own product...

25:03.135 --> 25:05.872
will also allow forensic teams
to track down...

25:05.938 --> 25:08.374
the source country
to determine who's to blame.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.311
It's just like checking
the label on a T-shirt
to determine where it's made,

25:12.378 --> 25:14.547
only a little more complicated.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.986
Okay. So, what?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.988
There's no opening
the safe without Brennen?

25:22.054 --> 25:24.624
Well, with enough time,
we could cut our way in.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.326
But there'd be no way
to hide our handiwork.
Brennen would find out.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.396
Right, and once he does,
Vaughn knows we got the list.
We'd have a war on our hands.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.465
I say the hell with this.
I say we let Brennen find out,
stick a gun in his mouth,

25:33.532 --> 25:35.802
tell him we're gonna
decorate the walls
with his big-ass brain...

25:35.868 --> 25:39.471
if he doesn't hand over
Mike's debrief--
problem solved.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.107

your head is at.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.776
But we don't know
where Brennen is.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.579
Right, and if we go looking
for him, we better make sure
he doesn't see our shadow,

25:46.646 --> 25:48.815
'cause he warned Mike
about the consequences
of following him.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.050
Okay, so we go invisible.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.985

a better idea?

the more eyeballs it attracts.
