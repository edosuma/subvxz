00:22.920 --> 00:26.606
- They all arrived this morning?
- Before dawn, Sire.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.606
This is bigger than I imagined.
The King seems content.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.568
My brother loves the tour.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.889
Later I'll take you on a private viewing
of the gardens.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.726
But first, the east wing,
extended beyond the original lodge.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.005
Here, you and your families
will be accommodated.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.204
It is my wish that above all, you see
Versailles not as the royal palace,

00:51.360 --> 00:52.964
but as your home.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.930
A place of leisure and conversation.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.651
A place of joy and light.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.360
Up here!

01:03.120 --> 01:04.690
What victories have I seen?

01:04.840 --> 01:07.764
I fought for you, at Douai!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.649
Lost my eye at Besançon!

01:10.760 --> 01:12.603
You will be compensated!

01:12.760 --> 01:14.888
And how much for my brother, Sire?

01:15.040 --> 01:17.520
Crushed by a stone
as he built your walls.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.360
What do you want?

01:20.840 --> 01:24.561
You said that France would honor
its heroes, that's your promise!

01:25.200 --> 01:26.406
Lies!

01:26.840 --> 01:30.481
We live and die like cattle.
Work as your slaves.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.202
You say you are France,

01:33.360 --> 01:36.284
but if you truly were,
you'd know our suffering.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.966
You'd feel it in your bones,

01:39.120 --> 01:41.009
and you'd take the pain away.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.807
Others feel our pain, Sire.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.241
And they are worth our loyalty.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.085
Come on soldier, don't be a fool.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.930
He makes fools of us all.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.166
Come down at once!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.445
Shall I descend?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.520
Very well.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.770
As your brother commands.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.327
No! Don't!

02:21.200 --> 02:23.282
The man believed he and the soldiers

02:23.440 --> 02:27.809
have not been given the honor and
respect they earned on the battlefield.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.849
Do they not now take orders?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.241
Their grievances are many, Sire.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.803
Many suffer from injuries sustained
at their work, as yet untreated.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.610
How many in the stoppage?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.769
So far 2,000.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.490
2,000, Sire.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.844
And unless they return to work,
construction stops.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.168
The second floor is not yet complete,
and winter is coming.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.685
With no lodgings, your new arrivals
may soon depart.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.811
Order them to work, meanwhile
the rest of the builders will continue.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.280
I fear not, Sire.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.411
- They too are refusing to work.
- Why?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.608
Working conditions are too harsh.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.445
- No care for their safety.
- Is that true?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.126
We lose half a dozen men per week.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.049
Many more injured.
We have a reckoning of compensation.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.569
- What will this man's family receive?
- Nothing, Sire.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.561
- He injured himself.
- Pay them anyway.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.207
It may assuage them,
but not the men.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.971
By the age of 30,
Alexander the Great created an empire

04:01.400 --> 04:03.482
stretching from Greece to India,

04:05.680 --> 04:09.765
but without his men, King Darius
would have driven him into the sea.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.690
Last year we retook
the Spanish Netherlands,

04:30.600 --> 04:33.285
soon we shall turn our eyes to Holland.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.681
We profit from our trade
with the land of King Annaba,

04:38.840 --> 04:41.571
even as the Duc De Cassel bows his head.

04:44.760 --> 04:49.482
I will not be pushed into the sea
by a builder on a scaffold.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.368
<i>* I'm the King of my own land,</i>

05:07.440 --> 05:10.410
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:15.726
<i>* I will fight until the end,</i>

05:19.560 --> 05:25.408
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me,</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your King,</i>

06:00.280 --> 06:04.330
I am sure the King will be delighted
to see you here.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.051
It's an honor to accede
to the King's wishes

06:07.200 --> 06:09.851
although I fear my resources
are not sufficient

06:10.000 --> 06:12.606
to maintain myself in the style

06:12.760 --> 06:15.081
to which he is accustomed.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.882
The King has extended to all nobles

06:20.040 --> 06:22.122
a financial inducement.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.046
Those who wish to build a house
at the periphery of the grounds

06:27.200 --> 06:30.204
will be forgiven all outstanding debts.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.725
Then I shall begin my planning at once.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.288
In the meantime, we'll do our best

06:37.440 --> 06:40.649
to make you comfortable
within the palace.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.766
Ah. Cassel.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.888
The black sheep returns.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.767
I'm so sorry to hear about your castle.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.685
- I understand it burnt down.
- It did.

06:53.280 --> 06:57.365
- Any idea how that happened?
- An accident, no doubt.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.202
Yes! Well, they do happen sometimes,
don't they?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.724
Please, follow me.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.206
It's a broom cupboard!

07:28.800 --> 07:31.531
In fact, I believe
it was a broom cupboard.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.650
Welcome to Versailles.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.282
You at least, continue your labor.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.964
But I am not a builder, Sire.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.724
But you were a soldier.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.883
When you fought for me
was there rebellion in the ranks?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.931
Occasionally, Sire.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.605
How did you get your scar?

08:08.840 --> 08:09.887
War, Sire.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.520
And the other?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.446
Rebellion.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.763
How did the generals react?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.203
That depended on
what kind of men they were, Sire.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.524
But I can tell you one thing,

08:32.400 --> 08:35.563
the King that brings soldiers
to face down soldiers,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.210
rarely stays King for long.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.449
I can see no resolution.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.770
There is one man to whom
they might listen, Sire.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.164
He has their respect,
he fought alongside them.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.851
Brothers can disagree with each other
without opposing one another.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.687
You were clearly an only child.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.324
Why do they behave this way?

09:21.040 --> 09:22.963
All men lash out, Sire,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.450
when they are in pain.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.250
Talk to them, soldier to soldier.
Offer nothing, this is a parlay.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.927
- There's another better than I.
- But I'm choosing you.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.401
Winter is near, the ground will harden.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.528
To build, we need foundations.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.445
Foundations must be dug.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.200
Now!

09:51.760 --> 09:53.762
Send for Bruhan, the architect.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.481
- Who is my director of bullion?
- Leclerc, of the royal mint.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.324
I want to see him too.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.208
- You tend to these men?
- I do.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.404
What do they suffer from?

10:31.720 --> 10:35.645
Gastric fever, gangrene,
crushed limbs that cannot heal.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.726
I would not advice you to approach them.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
Why not?

10:39.960 --> 10:42.850
There may be a miasma,
a pollution in the air.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.604
These are brothers in arms,
I shall take the risk.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.891
Drummer Brebant?

10:54.920 --> 10:58.811
Unless I am mistaken,
we took the town of Rochefort together.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.880
Lord Rohan.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.566
Are you in pain?

11:08.440 --> 11:10.727
All of France feels your suffering.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.166
And the King?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.683
He too feels your pain.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.045
You wished to see me.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.161
Here I am.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.163
Your horses are being fed extra grain,
Mlle De la Valiere.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.162
- Planning a journey?
- She yearns for release, my King.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.290
- From what?
- From torture.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.249
You only torture yourself.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.684
She desires a cloistered life
in a convent.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.805
Do not stand in her way,
she's suffered enough.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.529
No one is content.

12:34.760 --> 12:38.128
- I loved you, Sire.
- And I you, once upon a time.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.682
All stories must come to an end.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.081
Then I may go.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.446
You may not.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.849
What harm can it do,
she's no longer in your favour.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.241
This is your home, mademoiselle.
This is everyone's home.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.851
I will not permit it.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.122
Our son, Louis De Bourbon,
he's taken care of?

13:12.880 --> 13:14.006
In Paris.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.571
My promise remains.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.491
A child of France, no matter what.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.687
You get it.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.365
Hear about the builders?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.770
I try not to.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.600
One died right in front of us,
the others downing their tools.

15:22.760 --> 15:26.651
Now my good friend Pascal De St Martin
is here, but has no rooms.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.483
If I were him, I'd go home.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.010
If you were him, you'd be taller
and more handsome.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.842
Well, I fancy some air. Join me?

15:40.680 --> 15:42.489
Thought you hated the outdoors.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.283
I do, but not today.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.806
I know I vex you from time to time,

15:53.960 --> 15:55.928
and I admit, I am vain,

15:56.560 --> 16:00.645
lazy and excessively prone to frivolity,

16:01.640 --> 16:04.689
but a quick turn around
the garden before dinner

16:04.840 --> 16:08.049
is good for the soul,
and everyone should do it.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.120
What is it?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.127
You're pensive.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.090
We should do this more.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.011
We spend far too much time indoors.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.081
Your Highness?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.202
We need your help, your Highness.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.762
I recognize you, who are you?

16:47.680 --> 16:50.001
A sergeant in his majesty's army.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.011
What do you want?

16:52.760 --> 16:55.923
We may not be on the battlefield,
but we are in service

16:56.080 --> 16:58.082
and we insist on fair treatment.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.521
We ask you to speak to his majesty
about our demands.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.560
Respect!

17:06.079 --> 17:08.367
Our wounds, tended. Decent lodging.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.045
Fair pay and compensation
as befits the soldiers of the King.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.604
Why should I plead on your behalf?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.122
You could count on our support.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.522
In the event of a change
in circumstances.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.321
I don't understand you. What change?

17:41.120 --> 17:43.441
If your brother were no longer King.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.885
Do you realize I could have you hanged
for talking like this?

17:55.720 --> 17:56.767
I do.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.931
The sun is setting.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.046
What did he want?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.403
For me to speak to my brother.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.251
Madame De Claremont,

18:33.040 --> 18:37.602
you told me some time ago that
your estate papers would soon arrive.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.967
Many monther passed in fact.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.929
Yes, they will arrive soon.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.004
- You know how it is the south.
- Yes indeed.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.721
Naturally, we would not wish you,
of all people,

18:48.880 --> 18:50.928
to be obliged to leave.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.171
That is most considerate of you,
Mr Colbert.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.084
I shall do my best.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.127
Gentlemen,
I trust your lodgings are adequate?

19:00.280 --> 19:01.850
Yes, quite.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
The King.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.130
I'm starving.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.960
I notice your friend, Pascal
De St Martin has come to Versailles.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.450
He came of his own accord.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.807
But now he has nowhere to sleep tonight.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.208
He will be accommodated in due time.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.289
The builders are unhappy.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.170
Let me talk to them.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.804
I will not discuss politics at dinner,
and certainly not with you.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.849
They followed me into battle,

21:20.200 --> 21:23.204
perhaps they may follow me back to work.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.050
We will go hunting tomorrow!

21:31.480 --> 21:32.845
You ignore my offer.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.645
I do brother, I'm glad you noticed.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.926
Why then, are you keeping me here?

21:41.280 --> 21:43.487
My own house is ten miles away.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.889
If I have no function for you,
no position

21:48.040 --> 21:52.011
of which you deem worthy, but that
of a brother, why am I still here?

21:53.120 --> 21:57.364
I can go to Saint-Cloud and be your
brother in the comfort of my own bed.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.682
To see me, send up a firework.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.968
You're here because I want it.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.930
That is be reason enough.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.090
Henriette you must eat.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.204
If I didn't eat, I'd have no energy
for life's great pleasures.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.921
Here, have a lobster.
And some wine for her Highness.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.686
Really, I'm quite all right, thank you.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.410
Henriette, I know you.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.530
If you don't eat you'll shrivel up
and disappear.

22:27.160 --> 22:31.609
- Would you wish to give this up?
- I wish to know a thread of who I am.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.161
A thread of truth is enough to hang you.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.162
And our cousin?

22:38.960 --> 22:41.281
Or is our family a lie as well.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.444
Chevalier believes only
what is in front of his nose.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.045
If he feels he may profit

22:46.720 --> 22:49.451
he will help maintain
our position at court.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.206
That was true
until the King demanded proof.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.602
And what if we cannot convince him?
What happens then?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.650
We survive!

23:11.920 --> 23:14.924
You are looking very comely
this evening.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.921
Why, Mr Marchal, you're most kind.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.245
I said to him,

23:29.400 --> 23:32.609
"Fine, you can call me that
if you want to,"

23:32.760 --> 23:35.604
"but I am and exciseman."

23:36.440 --> 23:40.525
"And if the King is losing revenues
to bandits on the roads,"

23:40.680 --> 23:42.523
"I cannot be held responsible."

23:42.680 --> 23:46.651
"There is not a carriage
from here to Paris"

23:46.800 --> 23:48.768
"that is not vulnerable!"

23:49.200 --> 23:52.568
Now if the King's police cannot control

23:53.560 --> 23:58.043
the roads, then he cannot expect
a King's taxman to ride on them!

23:59.320 --> 24:02.449
Let alone arrive with four coffers.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.444
It sounds like you gentlemen
might need some help.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.409
We have no need of help, sir.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.962
What you have need of is protection.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.960
So, there we were,

24:22.120 --> 24:25.602
lost in the forest,
with no idea how to get back.

24:25.760 --> 24:30.004
We happened to stop by a small hut
for food and directions.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.366
Two sisters...

24:31.520 --> 24:35.206
Join me in the bedroom tonight,
I'll broaden your smile.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.528
You ask for nothing. Why?

24:39.440 --> 24:40.965
But I have all I need.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.041
See, I told you I'd make you smile.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.962
I spoke to the builders today,

24:50.400 --> 24:54.041
they are tired, hungry,
harsh measures will not work with them.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.921
Then I will address them.
Please keep your voice down.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.526
If I may be so bold, Sire,

25:00.680 --> 25:02.808
it will lessen their respect for you.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.126
Soldiers understand orders,
nothing more!

25:06.280 --> 25:09.966
Perhaps if a military man
were to approach them.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.964
- Reason with them?
- You're right.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.806
I will send Louvois.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.364
Forgive me, your majesty.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.727
I am feeling faint and will retire.

25:25.680 --> 25:29.651
What on earth is the matter
with you this evening?

25:29.800 --> 25:33.600
You used to be the brightest light
in the room, now you're absent.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.807
My apologies, Sire.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.001
Did I not satisfy you?

26:49.120 --> 26:51.248
Well, allow me to rectify the matter.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.090
I will return.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.168
Perhaps I can help you?

26:59.320 --> 27:02.164
You can start by not asking
so many questions.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.046
Very well, then I will wait.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.362
Hurry back.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.683
- What are you doing?
- Looking for my brother.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.366
I thought he might be... there.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.446
I know where he is.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.607
- Your Majesty!
- I was concerned about you.

28:22.760 --> 28:27.163
I am tired, Sire, that is all.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.361
And yet your eyes
tell a different story.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.129
He waits until you're tired
to have the big talk!

28:35.280 --> 28:38.090
He always done it to me too.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.362
- What are you doing up?
- Me?

28:41.520 --> 28:43.841
Oh, I've only just gotten out of bed.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.605
Some privacy, brother.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.569
I think you forget where you are

28:48.720 --> 28:50.961
I think you forget who addresses you.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.529
Louvois will not help you!

28:55.040 --> 28:56.201
Brother, not now!

28:56.880 --> 28:58.564
He's a hilltop general.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.882
A warrior trusts a man on the field.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.920
Take care, brother, with your words.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.644
You always defend yourself!

29:07.480 --> 29:11.690
You are blind to those
who want to help you!

29:11.840 --> 29:13.490
You can't help!

29:13.640 --> 29:16.325
Not everyone is trying
to knock you down.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.971
If you stopped attacking,
you might see it.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.442
Let others aid you in your decisions,
you cannot do it all.

29:23.760 --> 29:27.128
- Government is no business of yours.
- It could be!

29:27.280 --> 29:29.044
Please, stop.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.840
You won't do it,

29:31.280 --> 29:34.204
you think I, and the world, oppose you!

29:34.360 --> 29:37.045
- Stop!
- For heaven's sake, eat something!

29:37.200 --> 29:40.204
- What is the matter?
- I am expecting a child.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.006
I've a proposition.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.041
I'd rather you paid your share.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.926
It is here, my lord.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.209
I've not forgotten.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.525
I will not go back on the road
with a musket.

30:38.680 --> 30:42.162
- Too many police.
- We've friends among the police.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.526
Not enough.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.328
So I decided on a new plan for us.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.161
To offer protection to the exciseman.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.971
Bring me money.
I don't care how you come by it.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.681
The King's builders have downed tools.

31:01.200 --> 31:05.250
They share our frustrations
with his plans.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.846
The King will simply find more.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.163
Most of these builders are soldiers
who fought for him.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.530
The army has dissent among its ranks,
let's encourage it.

31:15.800 --> 31:19.407
The King will stop any insurrection
with the rest of his army.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.040
If he has any left by then.

31:22.800 --> 31:27.124
His majesty understands
that you do not feel

31:27.280 --> 31:30.124
that you have been shown
the respect you merit.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.691
You are mistaken.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.762
Without you, France would not exist.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.127
But you are its servants, just as he is.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.764
There will be other battles
to be fought,

31:43.920 --> 31:46.161
other wars to be won,

31:46.680 --> 31:51.004
but just as you stood side by side
on the fields of Flanders,

31:51.960 --> 31:54.691
the King asks you now

31:54.840 --> 31:59.926
to stand by side again,
here, in Versailles!

32:06.240 --> 32:07.685
Who is your leader?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.410
We have no leader.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.323
We speak with one voice.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.727
If you do not return to work,
I shall have you hanged!

32:25.880 --> 32:28.611
Kill me, and two more
shall take my place.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.161
I understand your complaints.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.811
Tell the King

32:34.800 --> 32:37.121
that we will fight for him again,

32:37.960 --> 32:40.008
build for him again,

32:40.160 --> 32:42.731
show trust and loyalty again,

32:43.640 --> 32:46.166
but first the King must show us all

32:46.720 --> 32:49.929
that he is a man
that will honor his promises.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.924
I was at Cambrais,
and at Compiegne!

33:05.240 --> 33:06.480
You need new locks.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.644
Have you lost your mind!
What are you doing here?

33:09.920 --> 33:13.891
I could fix it for you, of course,
but I'm withholding labor, so...

33:14.040 --> 33:16.202
You cannot be seen, you have to leave.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.880
And yet here I am.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.084
Funny how it works, isn't it?

33:22.840 --> 33:24.604
Have you been ignoring me?

33:24.760 --> 33:26.364
I sent you a dozen notes.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.720
Stop following me!

33:28.760 --> 33:31.764
- Remember who I am!
- Only too well!

33:31.920 --> 33:34.764
- You're more thorn than rose!
- Enough!

33:34.920 --> 33:37.366
- Is it mine?
- I cannot say.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.136
- Cannot, or will not?
- Abandon me, confine me!

33:39.160 --> 33:41.766
Go! I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.241
I can do neither,
as you know so well.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.209
Even as I feel betrayed by you,
by him, by myself!

33:48.360 --> 33:49.486
It already has.

33:50.520 --> 33:54.241
- Do you hate me?
- How much easier if I did.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.761
He will use this, you will see.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.803
- In what way?
- To get what he wants.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.248
- I do not believe it.
- Oh, I can assure you of it.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.129
It'll be his child on a Monday,
mine on a Tuesday,

34:20.920 --> 34:25.130
depending on his... mood, his needs,

34:25.800 --> 34:28.690
his whim, his health,

34:29.520 --> 34:33.081
his breakfast, or whichever way
the wind is blowing.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.090
It's not a child,

34:38.360 --> 34:40.043
it's a club you've given him,

34:41.199 --> 34:43.009
for him to beat us with.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.086
Your money!

35:07.920 --> 35:11.003
- And now you say...
- Oh, uh... Never!

35:12.520 --> 35:15.171
- You'd rather die?
- Never!

35:16.800 --> 35:17.881
What happens now?

35:18.040 --> 35:20.042
I forgot! Do I give you...

35:20.680 --> 35:23.809
You give me half, you take half.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.405
Then I hit you?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.844
I hit you. The driver, remember?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.685
Why yes, of course.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.125
What do you expect me to tell you?

35:38.280 --> 35:39.725
I'm a feather in the wind

35:39.880 --> 35:41.723
I don't know who I am,

35:41.880 --> 35:43.769
because my mother won't tell me!

35:53.840 --> 35:54.921
Come here.

35:58.520 --> 36:01.171
Sixteen years ago you were born,

36:01.680 --> 36:04.160
and I loved you and kept you safe.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.008
Where was I born? Pau?

36:09.160 --> 36:10.286
La Rochelle.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.007
And my father? A noble?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.011
A very good man.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.561
An architect, crushed by the King.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.171
Why would the King crush my father?

36:25.200 --> 36:27.168
Because of who he was.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.082
What? A criminal? A traitor?

36:32.920 --> 36:35.287
Worse... a protestant.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.806
Flowers!

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
How lovely.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.321
I thought they were for you.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.446
Who are they from?

36:59.880 --> 37:01.041
I have no idea.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.521
Mariette?

37:04.400 --> 37:05.811
Where's the bloody girl.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.481
Mariette!

37:32.200 --> 37:33.850
We cannot continue together.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.765
I understand.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.723
- Do you?
- You are the King, Sire.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.050
We are yours to own
and discard as you see fit.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.046
I have done neither to you.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.166
His majesty is hiding behind words,

37:56.400 --> 37:57.970
but his sense is clear.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.886
The child you carry is a symbol of doubt
which I do not wish to bear.

38:05.360 --> 38:09.843
Would you want me to own you, to the
exclusion of all others, of my brother?

38:13.560 --> 38:15.961
I cannot answer that question, Sire.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
I'm sorry.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.445
Please forgive me.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.527
Hello.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.010
What a pleasant surprise.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.771
- You're fond of your books, aren't you?
- Yes.

39:16.040 --> 39:19.408
At present, I'm reading
a treatise on espionage

39:19.560 --> 39:21.005
in the Roman Empire.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.001
I like a reader.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.806
Do you enjoy working?

39:50.160 --> 39:52.401
Enjoy is not the word I'd use.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.327
- What word would you use?
- Satisfaction.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.041
Does it pain you to see people suffer?

40:03.480 --> 40:05.608
I do not consider such matters.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.249
Do you look them in the eye?

40:10.720 --> 40:12.006
Always.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.640
Oh.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.047
I've never been with a woman
like you before.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.890
Oh my stars,

41:01.760 --> 41:03.250
you have so much to learn.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.171
Oh, gently.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.400
Gentle!

41:55.600 --> 41:59.400
Many thanks and congratulations.
We are ready.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.726
Bring them here.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.163
- Sire?
- The soldiers who refuse to work.

42:12.680 --> 42:15.524
Soldiers, Sire, here in the palace?

42:15.760 --> 42:18.684
Yes! I want to talk to them, in here.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.640
Tell them I have a proposal
which I believe will satisfy them.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.043
She went to the whorehouse
and spoke to the apothecary.

42:32.760 --> 42:35.161
Ordered two bottles of arsenic.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.845
A fine cure for a toothache,
I use it myself from time to time.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.490
And one bottle of Eros,

42:43.120 --> 42:45.691
to aid the vigor of amorous coupling.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.202
But perhaps you already know that.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.484
I pay you to spy on others, not on me.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.440
Right.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.400
This way.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.569
Don't touch!

43:25.160 --> 43:26.605
Is that me?

43:26.760 --> 43:27.807
Come!

43:28.440 --> 43:29.726
God, I'm ugly.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
I need you.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.164
Good morning, gentlemen.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.647
It is my honor to welcome you here.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.010
I live here but, this is not my home.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.721
This is a home for France,
and her aspirations.

44:29.400 --> 44:33.246
I wanted to thank you for showing me
the error in my thinking.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.202
You were right to down your tools,

44:37.240 --> 44:38.651
and refuse to work.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.283
It was I that was in the wrong.

44:45.440 --> 44:49.411
I've invited you here, today,
to ask for your forgiveness.

44:49.680 --> 44:53.082
And, to try to renew
your faith and trust in me.

44:53.640 --> 44:57.645
You are, all of you,
an army in the service of your King.

44:58.200 --> 45:01.921
Wherever it is, on the field,
or on the scaffolding.

45:02.600 --> 45:07.288
Now, it is time for France
to give you something in return.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
A home.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.088
It shall be known as "Les lnvalides".

45:17.760 --> 45:20.764
It will host the finest
medical facilities.

45:20.920 --> 45:24.049
Refectories, dormitories, church.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.525
It will be located in Paris,
close to the river.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.844
Every soldier, wounded, fighting
for France, will be taken there.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.367
And any soldier who can't go home

45:34.520 --> 45:36.682
can live here for the rest of his life

45:36.840 --> 45:39.889
in comfort, and free of charge.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.250
I've also struck a medal, made of gold,

45:45.400 --> 45:47.482
in honor of our recent victories.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.851
And I wish to give one to each of you.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.522
Hurrah for the King!

45:55.680 --> 45:56.806
You came?

45:56.960 --> 45:59.406
You really believed everything you said.

46:02.200 --> 46:06.489
The first to receive it,
is the man to whom I owe the most.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.847
A brave soldier known to you all.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.651
Philippe, Duke of Orléans.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.242
Who I am honored to call my brother.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.370
France thanks you.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.360
Thank you.

46:59.520 --> 47:02.410
France thanks you.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.560
Your majesty.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.408
The enemy is closer than you think!

47:07.520 --> 47:09.522
- Oh!
- Sire!

47:09.840 --> 47:12.571
The enemy is closer than you think!

47:16.040 --> 47:18.202
The poor fellow is sick.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.804
Let him be tended to.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.087
Sire?

47:25.600 --> 47:26.681
I'm fine.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.046
Get up! Let's go.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.967
- What are you doing?
- We're going home.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.691
- Why?
- I refuse to stay here another minute!

47:38.840 --> 47:42.526
Philippe, please, stop!
Explain yourself.

47:42.680 --> 47:46.685
I just realized we have a choice.
We don't have to do as he tells us.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.320
We have been cowards.
We are free to leave.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.802
It merely requires the courage
for us to resist him.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.167
- I don't understand.
- What do you want?

47:55.840 --> 47:58.969
To come with me, or to remain here?

47:59.120 --> 48:01.691
Waiting for his knock at your door.

48:02.760 --> 48:06.685
I don't care if the baby is mine,
or his,

48:07.360 --> 48:08.805
it will be ours.

48:15.040 --> 48:16.610
But our lives are here.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.570
You are brother to the King.
You cannot leave.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.489
This place is who you are, who we are.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.529
If that is true,
then we are already rotten inside.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.762
- Are you sure the cipher's been broken?
- I am.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.888
Then we must form a new codex.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.289
It will take some time.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.649
Until then,
we will need to meet in person.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.371
- It's a risk.
- They demand my papers.

49:04.040 --> 49:06.088
- Do you have the seal?
- I have it.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.606
Now, our first priority is the cipher.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.331
If they can read it,
they know our thoughts.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.244
They don't know that we know

49:22.680 --> 49:25.160
which now means, we have an opportunity.

49:58.880 --> 49:59.880
What is it?

50:03.440 --> 50:04.521
Very sorry.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.771
That it had to turn out this way.

50:07.920 --> 50:10.924
Per istam sanctam unctionem
et suam piissimam

50:11.080 --> 50:19.080
misericordiam adiuvet
Te Dominus gratia spiritus sancti.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.163
You didn't make peace with God.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.331
My brother, where is he? And Henriette?

51:05.520 --> 51:08.364
They're fine, they're sleeping.

51:11.520 --> 51:15.570
Your majesty, your majesty you are sick!

51:19.960 --> 51:21.325
Bontemps.

51:22.305 --> 51:28.767
