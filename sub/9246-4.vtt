WEBVTT

00:03.829 --> 00:06.180
Wow, there's so many
banquet halls to choose from.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.966
Yeah, a veritable plethora
of choices.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.054
Mike, what are you doing?

00:11.141 --> 00:12.142
And you've already eaten
all your

00:12.229 --> 00:13.448
weightwatcher points for today.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.276
No-no-no, I still
have three left.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.929
No, you ate those three points

00:17.017 --> 00:18.105
when you were sneaking
that candy bar

00:18.192 --> 00:19.541
when you were taking
out the garbage.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.718
It was fun sized.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.981
And how did you know
about that?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.375
Well, the first clue was that
you actually volunteered

00:27.462 --> 00:29.420
to take out the garbage
and the second was

00:29.507 --> 00:31.640
the peanut shard stuck
in your chest hair.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.773
That peanut could have been
there for days.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.689
Fine, I'm not
gonna be the diet police.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.256
Okay, gimme that.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.956
[sighs]
Alright, I think
I've got a couple that

00:44.044 --> 00:46.872
you know, might work for us,
and if we start saving now

00:46.959 --> 00:49.005
well, I think we should be able
to afford it.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.398
Oh, hang on,
isn't it traditional

00:50.485 --> 00:52.704
for the bride's family
to spring for the wedding?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.967
I think I'm a little old
to ask my mommy

00:55.055 --> 00:56.839
to pay for our wedding.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.537
I'll ask her.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.799
And you'd feel comfortable
with that?

01:00.886 --> 01:02.671
I eat candy
next to garbage cans.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.194
I'm not a prideful man.

01:06.501 --> 01:10.287
Oh, my God,
look at that sweet ride.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.115
Mike, we're in the middle
of something.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.510
Gorgeous.
What is she, a '57?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.338
You are correct, sir.

01:17.425 --> 01:21.168
'57 Chevy Bel Air sport sedan.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.518
It's got a 283
with a two-speed power glide.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.781
When I was a kid,
this was my dream car.

01:25.868 --> 01:29.219
Well, this and
the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.700
Well, for ten grand you can
live the dream, my friend.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.050
- Deal.
- No, no, no, Mike.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.878
What are you doing?

01:35.965 --> 01:38.054
Right, you're right.
I'll give you 9500.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.361
- Deal.
- No! No deal.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.319
She's right.

01:42.406 --> 01:43.581
I should test drive it first.

01:43.668 --> 01:44.930
- Deal?
- Deal.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.715
Could everybody just
stop saying "Deal"?

01:46.802 --> 01:48.847
[both]
Deal.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.762
♪ For the first time ♪

01:50.849 --> 01:54.288
♪ In my life ♪

01:54.375 --> 01:57.378
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:08.389 --> 02:09.955
Ooh, this is kinda neat.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.696
You could get married
on a four-hour cruise

02:11.783 --> 02:13.133
on Lake Michigan.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.525
Sure, the only thing
people like more

02:14.612 --> 02:15.570
than sitting through a wedding

02:15.657 --> 02:16.875
is being trapped at sea

02:16.962 --> 02:18.703
with a boatload
of drunk cousins.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.664
Yeah, it shifts
from a cocktail party

02:22.751 --> 02:27.712
to a hostage situation in
about an appletini and a half.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.628
What about just having
a traditional church wedding?

02:30.715 --> 02:32.935
Well, Mike's mom would love it
if we got married in a church

02:33.022 --> 02:35.503
so we won't be doing that.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.942
I did a good job
with you girls.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.381
I'm telling you, they don't make
engines like that anymore.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.601
Exactly, so it's gonna cost me
an arm and a leg

02:46.688 --> 02:48.298
for any replacement parts
and that should factor

02:48.385 --> 02:49.908
into your asking price.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.433
You're not really considering
buying that car, are you?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.957
Relax, I'm not gonna drop
eight grand on a used car.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.872
You mean the used car
you've been dry humping

02:56.959 --> 02:59.527
for the last hour?

02:59.614 --> 03:01.268
I was tryin' to get comfortable
in the seat.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.834
You unbuckled your pants.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.969
That's how I get comfortable.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.668
- Fine, eight grand.
- Vince!

03:10.755 --> 03:13.584
You're not gonna sell
that car to Mike for $8000.

03:13.671 --> 03:14.890
Thank you, mom.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.326
We could get ten
from a stranger.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.242
- Ten.
- You already said eight.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.506
- How about what I said?
- Did you say something?

03:22.593 --> 03:23.855
You know what?
Do what you want.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.553
But try and talk him
down to 7,000

03:25.640 --> 03:26.728
so you have enough left over

03:26.815 --> 03:28.991
to buy sex on the honeymoon!

03:35.127 --> 03:37.086
You heard the lady.
Seven thousand.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.959
[instrumental music]

03:42.570 --> 03:44.267
Yeah, the engine looks clean.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.704
- What's he asking for it?
- 'Eight thousand.'

03:46.791 --> 03:48.097
That's a good price.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.230
And look at this back seat.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.102
It's practically a hide-a-bed.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.104
Oh yeah, you put in a toilet
and a hot plate

03:55.191 --> 03:58.194
and it's an efficiency
apartment.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.804
Oh, what kind of gas mileage
does it get?

03:59.891 --> 04:01.458
Only about six miles
to the gallon.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.243
But it's got a 30-gallon tank.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.201
Ah.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.812
Nice. So almost 200 miles
between fill-ups.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.162
Yeah, that's pretty much what
I'm getting with the Galant now

04:10.250 --> 04:13.035
but with none
of the roominess or pizzazz.

04:13.122 --> 04:17.300
Oh yeah, you're up
to your nips in pizzazz.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.693
Hey, and what kind
of safety features?

04:18.780 --> 04:21.348
It's got a horn.
And I've got an airbag.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.658
Oh, my Lord.

04:27.745 --> 04:31.836
The 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.274
- Michael, is this your car?
- Thinking about it.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.624
Ooh, I had me some good times

04:36.711 --> 04:39.801
in the back of a Bel Air.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.282
I lost something in one of these
I ain't never getting back.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.154
[chuckles]

04:45.241 --> 04:46.547
Yeah, I-I'm gonna pretend
she's talking

04:46.634 --> 04:49.158
about her high school ring.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.161
I'd just turned 17
and had never been with a boy.

04:52.248 --> 04:55.164
You know, 'cause my momma
was so strict.

04:55.251 --> 04:58.080
Grandma, please, I don't need
to be hearing all that mess.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.560
You and Molly
are gonna look great

04:59.647 --> 05:00.996
riding around in this thing.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.563
Just tell her not
to wear her high heels

05:02.650 --> 05:04.913
in the back seat,
she'll puncture this upholstery

05:05.000 --> 05:06.958
and rip holes
in the roof lining.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.003
Grandma!

05:10.788 --> 05:12.529
But to tell the truth,
I don't think Molly's too keen

05:12.616 --> 05:13.661
on me buying this thing

05:13.748 --> 05:15.489
and we have a wedding
to pay for.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.186
Well, she got
an engagement ring.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.014
Why can't you
get something shiny?

05:19.101 --> 05:22.191
He was the handsomest boy
in our church

05:22.278 --> 05:24.236
and it was his daddy's car.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.630
And I remember,
"If I had a hammer"

05:26.717 --> 05:29.198
was playin' on the radio.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.591
And he did.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.247
Grandma, seriously

05:35.335 --> 05:37.641
that's not for my ears.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.643
Uh-uh, I'm just saying,
this might be the last chance

05:39.730 --> 05:41.645
you get to do something nice
for yourself.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.604
You're right,
I mean, if I'm not happy

05:43.691 --> 05:45.301
how am I ever
gonna make her happy?

05:45.388 --> 05:47.956
Tug on her hair
and stick a tongue in her ear.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.556
Hey, how come you get dessert
and I don't?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.514
Because for breakfast
I had cottage cheese and fruit

06:24.601 --> 06:26.690
and you had a fried egg
on a pop-tart.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.607
Well, listen, if I promise
to budget my points

06:30.694 --> 06:32.435
better tomorrow,
can I have a bite?

06:32.522 --> 06:34.394
Sorry, pal, you've been playing
with the house's money

06:34.481 --> 06:35.917
for about two days now.

06:37.614 --> 06:38.746
And you're telling me
you didn't have anything

06:38.833 --> 06:40.225
to eat when you were at Carl's?

06:40.312 --> 06:42.271
No, I just showed him the car,
that's all.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.404
By the way, he thought
it was a steal at that price.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.232
Well, maybe he should buy it.

06:47.319 --> 06:50.627
Carl would look like an idiot
in that car.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.587
Besides, his dream car is
the Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.373
He's a child.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.157
Be that as it may,
I just don't think

06:59.244 --> 07:01.029
it's a practical purchase
right now.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.683
That car is an investment.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.685
It originally sold for $2000.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.251
Sixty years later,
it has appreciated

07:06.338 --> 07:07.296
four hundred percent.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.471
In my mind, we're driving around

07:08.558 --> 07:09.907
in our kids' college fund.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.431
My thoughts exactly.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.564
Listen, you can't
decide anything

07:14.651 --> 07:15.957
until you take a ride in it.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.001
And if you don't fall
in love with it

07:17.088 --> 07:19.395
the way I did, I'll let it go.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.441
Alright, fine.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.573
But we're stopping by
to get some frozen yogurt

07:23.660 --> 07:26.141
because I still have
five points left.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.925
That's impossible.
I wanna see your score card.

07:28.012 --> 07:31.059
You're shavin' points somewhere.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.235
No, I'm just
not having secret picnics

07:33.322 --> 07:34.976
by the garbage cans.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.373
I'm telling you, we'll get a lot
of use out of this car.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.332
You know, how you're always
telling me what a big load I am

07:43.419 --> 07:48.076
on the weekends? Well, in this
baby, I'm a load on the road.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.426
So it's basically
just a couch that moves?

07:50.513 --> 07:53.603
Oh, it moves alright.
Can your couch do this?

07:53.690 --> 07:56.258
[laughs]

07:56.345 --> 07:58.782
Oh, my God,
this thing is a rocket.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.785
I told you.
We'd have a blast in this car.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.526
I'm not saying it's not cool.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.267
I just don't think
it's very practical.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.703
It'll be our vacation car.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.663
We could take
weekend road trips in it.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.709
Well, it would be fun
to get out of the house.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.233
Maybe drive down Route 66.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.105
We could take it all the way
to the Grand Canyon.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.150
- Can I drive it?
- No.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.848
I mean, yeah, yeah,
you can drive it

08:20.935 --> 08:22.545
but there's no power steering
and you've really

08:22.632 --> 08:23.981
gotta stand on the brakes.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.983
So I'd never get to drive it?

08:26.070 --> 08:30.074
What? Who said that? Nobody
said that. This is our car.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.947
I'm just giving you a little
heads-up on how she handles.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.992
Well, just pull over
and let me drive.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.907
Okay.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.257
But I'm warning you,
it's big, it's loud

08:39.344 --> 08:40.998
and the tailpipe backfires.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.523
I'll be fine, I sleep
with you every night.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.004
[laughs]

08:50.051 --> 08:51.922
Well, maybe we can swing this.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.445
You know, if we don't eat
out as much

08:53.533 --> 08:54.882
and we could scale back
on the wedding.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.579
Now you're talking.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.102
I mean, we don't have
to release all those doves

08:58.189 --> 08:59.451
for our first kiss.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.279
Carl's got an uncle
that raises pigeons.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.630
It's not like the Audubon
society's gonna be there.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.850
Hey, give that horn a honk.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.765
[honking]

09:08.852 --> 09:12.247
- Cool, right?
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.031
Okay, if we're
gonna really do this

09:14.118 --> 09:15.772
let's have a plan,
let's hit Vince

09:15.859 --> 09:17.731
with good cop, bad cop
and I bet we can get him

09:17.818 --> 09:19.646
down to seven grand.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.473
Well, you're close.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.564
I got him down
to seventy two-five.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.394
Wait, you already
bought the car?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.266
No, we already
bought the car.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.181
Do I know my lady or what?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.621
[honking]

09:42.451 --> 09:43.757
Mm-hmm.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.200
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.505
I anticipated your needs

09:53.593 --> 09:55.159
I thought you liked it,
when I did that.

09:55.246 --> 09:58.032
By anticipating my needs,
I mean spraying Febreze

09:58.119 --> 09:59.381
on your feet
before coming to bed

09:59.468 --> 10:00.904
not tricking me
into doing something

10:00.991 --> 10:03.603
that you've already done.

10:03.690 --> 10:07.519
You say "Trick," I say
"Delightful surprise!"

10:07.607 --> 10:09.260
The point is we're both
proud owners

10:09.347 --> 10:11.219
of a cool vintage automobile.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.743
Oh, no, no, no. I want nothing
to do with that car.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.615
- That's yours.
- Oh, come on. Don't say that.

10:15.702 --> 10:16.920
We're gonna have a blast
in that thing.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.095
We were halfway
to the Grand Canyon

10:18.182 --> 10:19.357
a minute ago.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.794
The only time I'm driving
to a big hole

10:20.881 --> 10:22.622
with you is to push you in it.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.061
Okay, I'm a police officer
and technically

10:27.148 --> 10:28.410
that's a death threat.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.152
Well, book me, dumbo.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.983
Look, I can't believe
you played me like that.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.811
I knew when you saw
how happy it made me

10:37.898 --> 10:39.203
you'd want me to have it,
I mean, you want me

10:39.290 --> 10:40.770
to be happy, don't you?

10:40.857 --> 10:43.381
Are you happy right now?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.166
That depends.
Do I get to keep the car?

10:45.253 --> 10:48.865
Just so you know,
I already deposited the check.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
I'll deal with you later,
shame on you

10:50.650 --> 10:54.610
for taking advantage
of this candy-sneaking bonehead.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.307
Alright, if we're just
gonna resort

10:56.394 --> 10:59.136
to childish name-calling,
I'm out of here.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.965
And I don't care what you say,
that car completes me.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.404
I can't believe he bought
that car from you

11:06.491 --> 11:08.189
behind my back.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.105
In his defense,
7800 is a great deal

11:11.192 --> 11:13.368
for that classic automobile.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.805
Seventy-eight?
He told me seventy two-five.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.372
Boy, every time
he opens his mouth

11:17.459 --> 11:19.287
a lie falls out of it, huh?

11:25.119 --> 11:26.729
Anybody got any jumper cables?

11:30.777 --> 11:32.822
I would've been a fool
not to buy this car.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.737
And if she doesn't
wanna ride in it, fine.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.521
It'll just be the "Bro-mobile."

11:36.608 --> 11:38.915
Does the "Bro-mobile" have heat?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.397
Because I, for one,
am freezing my bro-nads off.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.877
Roll up the window, man.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.661
Actually, better to leave
the windows down

11:45.748 --> 11:48.838
until I get a handle
on these exhaust fumes.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.058
[coughs]
Yeah.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.755
Every once in a while
we should say the alphabet

11:52.842 --> 11:54.670
just to make sure
nobody's getting brain damage.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.370
- Does the radio work?
- Absolutely.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.024
You have your choice
of conservative talk

12:01.111 --> 12:03.113
or contemporary ranchero.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.595
[engine sputtering]

12:06.682 --> 12:09.293
- What is that sound?
- It's just settling.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.817
Older cars have to settle.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.253
This thing has had 50 years
to settle.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.428
It sounds like a wheelchair

12:13.515 --> 12:15.909
going down a metal staircase.

12:15.996 --> 12:19.129
That is the Detroit symphony.
Music to my ears.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.088
What comes after the letter "L?"

12:21.175 --> 12:22.698
"M."

12:22.785 --> 12:24.700
You know, I still can't believe
you bought this thing

12:24.787 --> 12:26.049
without clearing it with Molly.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.529
Hey, I brought her in
after the fact

12:27.616 --> 12:29.270
because I wanted
to surprise her.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.663
Uh, like when the Senegalese
army moves into your home

12:31.751 --> 12:34.405
calls it a barracks,
and tells you you're a corporal.

12:34.492 --> 12:37.539
- Surprise.
- Hey, I never lied to her.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.584
I just sat on the truth
until she came

12:39.671 --> 12:41.282
around to my way of thinking.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.284
Whatever you need to say
to look yourself in the mirror.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.766
By the way, where is the mirror?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.551
It snapped off
in an Arby's drive-thru.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.422
This thing's a little wider
than I'm used to.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.426
Huh. Well, that's new.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.909
It's not that he bought the car

12:59.996 --> 13:02.564
it's just that he did it
without telling me.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.654
He is kinda sneaky.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.613
The other day
I saw him eating a chocolate bar

13:08.700 --> 13:10.006
behind a tree.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.836
I know, he thinks
he's skinnier than the tree.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
It's actually..

13:15.533 --> 13:18.232
It's kinda cute.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.625
Well, did you tell him that you
didn't want him to buy the car?

13:20.712 --> 13:21.801
No, I can't do that.

13:21.888 --> 13:22.889
Then every time he sees

13:22.976 --> 13:24.368
a classic car on the road

13:24.455 --> 13:26.501
I'd be the bad guy.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.025
It's like when mom wouldn't
let me have a pet monkey.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.203
Even now when I see a chimp
or a little old Greek woman

13:33.290 --> 13:34.770
I get pretty PO'd.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.430
Yeah, just like that.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.480
Sweetie, you're not
fooling anyone.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.482
You're covered in chocolates.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.009
It's not chocolate,
it's engine gunk.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.533
- Where's Vince?
- He's upstairs.

13:58.620 --> 14:02.363
Having a little trouble
with the ol' jalopy?

14:02.450 --> 14:03.930
It's all good.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.496
You see, tinkering
under the hood is part

14:05.583 --> 14:08.543
of the fun
of owning a classic automobile.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.676
Oh, well it looks like you're
having the time of your life.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.419
Oh, I am. Excuse me.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.856
Absolutely.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.642
Jackass.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.037
Vince? Vince!

14:24.124 --> 14:25.125
[Vince]
'What-what, what do you want?'

14:25.212 --> 14:26.953
We need to talk about the car.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.216
'Glad you're enjoying it.
What a deal, huh?'

14:29.303 --> 14:31.653
'Boy, you saw me coming.'

14:31.740 --> 14:33.002
Get out here.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.752
Okay, so now
you know my beauty secret.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.580
You sold me a piece of crap.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.669
Are you familiar
with the expression

14:47.756 --> 14:49.062
"Buyer beware?"

14:49.149 --> 14:50.628
Are you familiar
with the expression

14:50.715 --> 14:51.760
"I'm a cop and you're
gonna get parking tickets

14:51.847 --> 14:53.022
for the rest of your life?"

14:53.109 --> 14:54.371
The corruption
in this city sickens me.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.895
Get goin'!

14:57.853 --> 15:00.160
The radiator's overheating,
the transmission's slipping

15:00.247 --> 15:01.857
and there's gotta be a leak
in the gas tank

15:01.944 --> 15:03.990
because I'm getting
like four blocks a gallon.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.689
You bought a car
that's pushin' 60.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.343
I'm only 58
and I have to repaint

15:09.430 --> 15:10.997
my hair every three weeks.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.739
I also overheat
and tend to leak.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.483
Vince, I told you
this was a bad idea.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.138
Hey, I didn't know he was
gonna be such a baby about it.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.748
Hey, I'm not being a baby,
you just knew things

15:23.835 --> 15:25.402
about this car
you didn't divulge.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.622
Oh, and how did
that make you feel?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.580
Deceived? Betrayed?

15:29.667 --> 15:32.366
Like a boob?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.846
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know
I couldn't buy something

15:34.934 --> 15:37.066
with my money
without clearing it with you.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.982
Look, when you put this ring
on my finger, we became a team.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.637
It's not your money or my money,
it's our money.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.900
Okay, well then you owe me
for half of that ring.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.035
Which will easily cover the cost
of the repairs.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.342
Just give him the money back,
Vince.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.998
Then how is he ever gonna learn
from his mistakes?

15:56.085 --> 15:58.827
Do the right thing.
And make it fast.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.133
In about four minutes
you're gonna start

16:00.220 --> 16:01.743
looking like Count Chocula.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.878
Alright. I'll give you seven
grand for the car.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.489
- Deal.
- Hold on a second.

16:08.576 --> 16:11.231
We paid 78 for it,
we're not taking a penny less.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.668
Seventy eight?
The transmission slips.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.149
There's a leak in the gas tank,
and the brakes are shot.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.672
That thing's a death trap.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.633
Seventy two-five.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.853
I need to confer with my partner
before I make any kind of--

16:24.940 --> 16:26.333
- Take it.
- Deal.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.993
Alright, are you sure
you're ready to do this?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.125
Your finances, my finances.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.302
- Full disclosure.
- Full disclosure.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.391
Alright, this is the balance
of my checking account

16:41.478 --> 16:45.091
which does not reflect
the $7200 check from Vince.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.964
Oh,you're a thrifty one, huh?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.357
Well, I try to live
within my means.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.706
Plus, I return my pop bottles

16:51.793 --> 16:53.447
and I use the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.841
And you wear your underwear
until they look like

16:56.928 --> 16:58.539
vertical blinds.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.718
- Thrifty and sexy.
- Sure.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.329
So this, along
with my savings account

17:06.416 --> 17:09.332
is a nice little start
on a nest egg.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.508
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.554
- Ooh-ooh!
- Your turn.

17:13.641 --> 17:14.903
Okey-dokey.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.384
[chuckles]
Uh...okay.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.821
Just so you know,
I'm not really..

17:19.908 --> 17:22.606
You know, a stickler
for writing things down

17:22.693 --> 17:25.000
but..

17:25.087 --> 17:26.828
Yeah, so..

17:26.915 --> 17:28.177
Just a, um..

17:28.264 --> 17:31.485
...just a, you know, a ballpark.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.661
This is everything?
This is all your money?

17:33.748 --> 17:35.576
Well, I don't like to keep a lot
in my checking account.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.317
- You don't make interest.
- Smart.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.405
So you got a lot in savings?

17:38.492 --> 17:40.102
Enough to keep the account open.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.324
How can this be?
You own your own car.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.977
You live with your mother,
please tell me

17:46.065 --> 17:47.979
you're a drug addict.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.459
Don't be silly, I just..

17:49.546 --> 17:51.896
You know, I like
to-to travel a bit.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.289
Travel where?

17:53.376 --> 17:56.336
I don't know. Asia, Africa.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.512
South America.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.557
Europe.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.169
You know what I did with my
two weeks vacation last year?

18:03.256 --> 18:06.433
I dug a new septic tank
in my mother's house.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.825
And I charged her.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.742
I went to Prague.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.093
I took my sister.
It was amazing.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.356
She had never been before.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.184
- You'd been there before?
- Yeah.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.404
I mean it was just a stop
on my way to Moscow with my mom.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.366
- Moscow?
- Well, I like to travel.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.324
And my mom likes vodka.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.286
It was either that or Poland,
and I'm sort of Warsawed out.

18:36.941 --> 18:37.986
Hang on, so you're telling me

18:38.073 --> 18:39.422
this is all the money
you've got?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.772
Well, yeah, you know,
and I'm carrying

18:41.859 --> 18:44.123
I'm carrying a little..

18:44.210 --> 18:47.213
...bit of credit card debt.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.998
How little?

18:50.085 --> 18:52.653
Uh...17000.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.748
Wait, you're telling me
you owe 17 grand?

19:00.835 --> 19:04.926
No. We owe 17 grand.

19:11.498 --> 19:12.673
[theme music]
