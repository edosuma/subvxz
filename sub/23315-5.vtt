WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.233
Oi, oi! We're back!

00:13.833 --> 00:15.733
Get me back in the house.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.267
Stand by! Geordies incoming.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.300
Woo!

00:21.367 --> 00:24.200
Oh, my God.
Woo!

00:25.767 --> 00:28.467
I'm so excited,
I caca-poo-pooed in my knickers.

00:34.833 --> 00:36.167
(squealing)

00:36.233 --> 00:39.233
What's the three things that
Geordies are good at?

00:39.300 --> 00:42.767
Bucking, necking...

00:42.833 --> 00:44.233
...and drinking.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.667
Toon, we are coming for ya.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.967
Shit's about to go down.

00:55.033 --> 00:57.300
This is mint.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.667
(all cheering)

00:59.733 --> 01:02.233
Toon Tours are going to
Tenerife!
(all cheer)

01:02.300 --> 01:05.233
Aaron, you won't be travelling
with the others.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.500
If Aaron's not going, fuck it.
I'm not.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.567
Hello, Tenerife.

01:08.633 --> 01:13.767
Found a lad, his name's TJ.
Might
get him to check out my
va-jay-jay.

01:13.833 --> 01:16.300
I think I'm gonna go to bed,
you know?

01:16.367 --> 01:19.033
I've left Chloe and Sam
in the pool together.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.267
I would like to believe that
she wouldn't get with him. Oops.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.933
I am no-one's sloppy seconds.

01:28.933 --> 01:32.333
No, he didn't.
(shouting)

01:35.367 --> 01:36.533
Sam who?

01:37.433 --> 01:41.633
Going to the shag pad with Chloe
is
not how I expected tonight to
end.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.667
(moaning)

01:46.467 --> 01:49.233
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.267
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:52.333 --> 01:55.067
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.067
I'm preened to perfection.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.300
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.033
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.833
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:04.900 --> 02:08.733
I might be totally bonkers
but all of us are.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.200
(all) Geordie Shore, wye aye!

02:21.633 --> 02:22.767
(farts)

02:28.267 --> 02:33.067
I've woken up alone. Again.
Where
are my actual fucking friends?

02:36.433 --> 02:38.200
Good morning, sweet cheeks.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.333
(chuckles)
How are we today?

02:42.400 --> 02:43.867
You've got a funny accent.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.900
Sometimes when I wanna be sexy,
I change my accent.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.133
Boys fucking love it!

02:49.200 --> 02:53.000
Sam, this is the first time
that we've ever woke up
together.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.933
I know, how do you feel about
that?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.433
I'm gutted, Sam.
What do you think, you divvy?

02:57.500 --> 03:01.833
I'm over the moon. Hopefully
Abbie
gets the hint that you are mine.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.967
Hope she's not hurt that we are
here.
Do you think she is?

03:05.033 --> 03:08.300
Didn't you get some sort of
message?
She gave us her blessing.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.733
Who is she, God?
(laughs)

03:10.800 --> 03:13.700
I'm really glad things have been
put to bed with Abbie.

03:13.767 --> 03:16.033
Now instead of there being
three wise men,

03:16.100 --> 03:18.300
we're now the two wise men.
Me and Chloe.

03:18.367 --> 03:21.067
One wise man, one wise woman.

03:21.133 --> 03:24.033
Got a surprise for you out
there,
you know? Who, me?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.433
Yeah. I wanna take you out
on a little date.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.533
You've not gonna engage to us,
are ya?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.000
I've only known you a week.

03:30.067 --> 03:33.600
I'm buzzing that me and Chloe
have
finally got things back on
track.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.067
Now I need to prove to her
how much I like her.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.767
I just need this date to work.

03:37.833 --> 03:40.833
I'm not being funny
but you're a bit cocky, aren't
ya?

03:40.900 --> 03:44.000
Why? If you planned this date
when I wasn't speaking to you,

03:44.067 --> 03:46.133
you knew you were gonna win us
back over.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.400
I always back myself
to win you back.

03:48.467 --> 03:51.067
I've been hurt by so many lads
in the past

03:51.133 --> 03:52.567
and Sam is still on thin ice

03:52.633 --> 03:55.500
so he better have something good
up his sleeve.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.500
I forgive you for now.
It depends how good the date is.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.033
I've woken up
and I'm absolutely hanging.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.000
There's definitely something
in the Tenerife drink.

04:07.067 --> 04:09.267
Did you see that lad?
What happened?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.667
I had my beer goggles on
really badly.

04:11.733 --> 04:16.033
When I got back, I was talking
to him, he was like, "Oh, I'm
20".

04:16.100 --> 04:18.132
I was like, "Oh, my God, go
home."

04:18.200 --> 04:21.333
I'm 24. I can't believe
I brought a lad back

04:21.399 --> 04:23.100
that's so much younger than me.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.767
I usually like the older ones.

04:24.833 --> 04:28.333
I'm happy that Chloe and Sam
made up
for the awkwardness

04:28.400 --> 04:31.600
with everyone being in the
house.
Yeah. I think it's better

04:31.667 --> 04:34.100
for the whole house
if they are, to be honest.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.633
Yeah. I just want
all of this drama to stop.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.533
Yes, I did like Sam but
he's much more suited to Chloe.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
It's just shit
seeing them so loved up.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.400
I'm happy for them
if you're OK about it.

04:45.467 --> 04:48.467
I wouldn't be angry
or upset for them.

04:51.467 --> 04:54.933
Where's Chloe?
She didn't sleep in my bed.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.467
Sam didn't sleep in my bed.

04:56.533 --> 04:59.667
If they had sex, he's fucked.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.700
If he had sex with her,
this is his balls.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.833
Ooh. Gone.
That's what Chloe has.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.200
I'm happy for Chloe.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.900
She deserves happiness
from someone who's nice.

05:09.967 --> 05:12.233
And Sam could be just that.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.033
Morning, bitches.
Hello, you.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.833
Get yourself there,
I've made breakfast for us all.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.467
Ooh! What a darling.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.933
Hey. Morning.
Oi! Shaggers!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.467
Shag-arife or not?

05:31.533 --> 05:33.500
Everyone is such fishwives.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.333
Everyone is dying to know
what happened last night.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.100
We tried to.
Did spooning lead to forking?

05:40.167 --> 05:41.500
It led to fingering.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.967
We're going on a date.
With who?

05:44.033 --> 05:46.067
Me, you fucking idiot. Who else?

05:46.133 --> 05:49.000
A date! Chloe, have you ever
been taken on a date?

05:49.067 --> 05:50.700
No, never.
Haven't ya?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.200
Chloe has never
been on a date before.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.600
She's 22 years old.
I hope it goes well.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.800
Mind you, even if it doesn't,
she wouldn't fucking know.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.200
You can't kiss anyone
on the first date.

06:01.267 --> 06:04.667
When I met my boyfriend, I
sucked
his dick twice and I rimmed him

06:04.733 --> 06:08.533
on the first date. Believe me,
babe.
You can do what the fuck you
want.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.933
Chloe and Sam are going
on their first proper date

06:12.000 --> 06:15.100
and I hope he pulls something
out the bag

06:15.167 --> 06:17.567
cos my princess deserves
everything.

06:17.633 --> 06:18.833
(phone rings)
Phone!

06:18.900 --> 06:22.433
I'm not getting it. You know
it's
gonna be the fucking beast,
Anna.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.767
(chuckles) If Anna fucks up
my first date, I will kill the
cow.

06:26.833 --> 06:27.967
Hello?

06:30.533 --> 06:31.533
(gasps)

06:38.500 --> 06:40.833
(all) Yeah!
Woo!

06:41.933 --> 06:44.400
(mouths words)

06:44.467 --> 06:48.333
Anna can fuck off. After
everything
that's happened with Chloe and
Sam,

06:48.400 --> 06:52.333
I want some attention tonight
and if we neck on, then we neck
on.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.600
Shall we go get ready
for some date, then?

06:54.667 --> 06:57.400
Let's go. Chloe. Play it cool.
Yeah, play it cool.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.600
It's great that Sam's treating
Chloe
to take her on a date

07:00.667 --> 07:04.033
but I do hope Abbie's OK with it
cos it must be tough on her.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.667
I've got a really good idea
what we'll do. What?

07:06.733 --> 07:09.900
If these lot think they're
sitting
around hungover all day,

07:09.967 --> 07:12.867
they've got another thing
coming.
Mountain biking.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.400
Because Sophie's on a health
kick,
she's thought it's a good idea

07:16.467 --> 07:19.100
to go mountain biking.
I wouldn't do it in England

07:19.167 --> 07:21.233
so why the fuck would I do it
in Tenerife?

07:21.300 --> 07:26.300
Come on, guys! Get your
active-wear
on, let's go riding on bikes.

07:28.067 --> 07:31.267
Ugh, this has got to be the
worst
possible thing I could do.

07:33.433 --> 07:36.033
Everyone's gonna think
I've got a hanging fanny.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.233
Right, come on, guys!

07:41.300 --> 07:42.767
Nathan!

07:48.867 --> 07:50.700
Who in their right mind

07:50.767 --> 07:53.800
goes on a bike ride
when it's 1,000 degrees outside?

07:53.867 --> 07:56.033
The sweat gets rid of the
hangover.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.867
Sweat is your fat crying
so make your fat cry.

07:59.933 --> 08:01.367
Yeah. My fat will be crying

08:01.433 --> 08:04.100
because it's saying,
"I want to go to fucking bed!"

08:05.933 --> 08:08.767
Ow, you fucking...
What the hell, Sophie?

08:08.833 --> 08:11.700
Come on, guys.
We're in the outback of nowhere.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.400
Going up there.
Woo!

08:13.467 --> 08:16.033
Should be one of the longest
rides
of your life.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.367
Bitch, I'm coming! (screams)
Bye, bitch!

08:19.433 --> 08:21.200
Wee!

08:22.367 --> 08:24.233
Fucking sweating my left tit
off.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.533
Watch out.
(screaming)

08:26.600 --> 08:28.300
I don't like this!
What is it?

08:28.367 --> 08:31.000
Ooh! Nathan, you all right
there?
Fuck off.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.267
Sophie, I love ya
but I'm really sorry.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.633
I'm not riding this bike
any fucking more.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.533
I ride dick! Not bikes!

08:41.832 --> 08:42.900
Thank you.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.133
I don't know
what I'm more nervous about.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.933
This being my first date
or what the hell Sam has got
planned!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.333
What are we doing, Sam?

08:50.400 --> 08:53.633
Well, we're not going swimming.
Good cos I can't swim.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.567
I know exactly what we're doing.
We're going on a boat.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.433
Nice champagne. Nice food.
I'm so excited!

08:59.500 --> 09:03.000
We're going parascending.
What the fuck is "para-dending"?

09:03.067 --> 09:05.967
Like, where you go in a balloon,
in the air dead fast.

09:06.033 --> 09:07.833
Dead high up.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.733
Ooh, isn't that a bit dangerous?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.267
Shit. Chloe doesn't look
too sure about this.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.367
Once we're in the air,
she'll like it.

09:15.433 --> 09:17.400
What's the boat doing?
(laughs)

09:17.467 --> 09:20.400
The waves are too big to do
this.
It's a tsunami.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.033
It's rocky,
like my last relationship.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.900
(both laugh)

09:24.967 --> 09:27.700
Me and Chloe may not have had
the smoothest of starts

09:27.767 --> 09:31.433
but you know it's a good sign
when
a girl's laughing at your jokes.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.433
(sighs) Now it is time to go
1,000 feet in the air,

09:37.500 --> 09:40.533
above dark water with sharks in
it.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.800
Great.

09:41.867 --> 09:43.467
I'm scared.
(motor whirring)

09:43.533 --> 09:45.767
When does it go up? Oh, my good-
Oh.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.567
I don't like it.

09:47.633 --> 09:51.133
I don't like water, I don't like
air
and I don't like boats.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.800
What the fuck am I doing here?

09:52.867 --> 09:55.100
Think I'm gonna be sick.
This is cute.

09:55.167 --> 09:58.667
It's absolutely awful.
Oh, I don't like it, man!

09:58.733 --> 10:00.533
(screams)

10:00.600 --> 10:03.567
(squeals) I wanna come back!

10:08.400 --> 10:11.867
Who wants a beer? I wondered
what you had in that backpack.

10:11.933 --> 10:13.667
Aw, thank you.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.467
Where do you reckon
Sam and Chloe went today?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.367
I'd want a candle-lit dinner
on the beach.

10:19.433 --> 10:22.500
You're sophisticated.
Chloe is anything but that.

10:22.567 --> 10:25.600
True. Being totally honest,
it's not a nice thing to see,

10:25.667 --> 10:28.200
like, them two getting together
and cracking on

10:28.267 --> 10:31.233
because in my head, I was like,
"I'm not good enough."

10:31.300 --> 10:34.000
You start to feel
that no-one wants you.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.067
I feel for Abbie. She's had
a rough time over Sam and Chloe

10:37.133 --> 10:40.100
but hopefully she can find
a little holiday romance

10:40.167 --> 10:42.767
to boost her confidence
while we're in Tenners.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.933
Remember, there is more than Sam
out there.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.567
When we're out tonight, you have
to
help us find male attention.

10:49.633 --> 10:53.400
Oh, 100%! Abbie's being really
mature about this situation.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.867
I'm so proud of her.

10:54.933 --> 10:58.033
And we all know
the best way to get over a guy

10:58.100 --> 10:59.933
is to get under another one.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.033
To Abbie getting a new man.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.233
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes! Woo!

11:04.300 --> 11:05.467
(laughter)

11:05.533 --> 11:07.167
(spits) What was that?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.967
Argh! I wanna get out!

11:12.033 --> 11:15.700
I'm having a great time in the
air
but by the sounds of things,

11:15.767 --> 11:18.633
I'm pretty sure
Chloe is not enjoying this at
all.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.367
I don't like it.
Fucking hell.

11:20.433 --> 11:21.867
What's happening?

11:21.933 --> 11:23.733
We're going in.
(screams)

11:23.800 --> 11:25.367
(chuckles)

11:28.267 --> 11:29.967
Thank you.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.067
It would've been so much
more simpler, so much cheaper,

11:33.133 --> 11:36.733
so much happier if he just took
us
for some fucking food.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.133
It wasn't your cup of tea.
It's the thought that counts.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.867
Next time I'm just gonna take ya
for a meal or a drink.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.100
Right, OK. Perfect.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.200
Do you want a second date?
Yeah.

11:50.267 --> 11:53.533
Oh, my God.
Sam has asked me on a second
date.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.800
Thank fuck the smell of me
shitting myself in the air

11:56.867 --> 11:58.933
has not put him off. Get in!

12:02.667 --> 12:05.800
The date might not have been
my best idea but I got to neck
on.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.833
I've got a second date
so I must be doing something
right.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.133
I wanna get out
before I go fucking back up.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
(laughs)

12:14.100 --> 12:15.600
Let's fucking party!

12:16.533 --> 12:19.133
Ohh!
I actually want to fuck that
tit.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.433
Eat as much pussy as you can.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.233
No necking on with the clients.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.333
Am I gonna get wet?

12:25.400 --> 12:28.233
I need to go home.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.533
Geordie Shore, why aye!

12:32.967 --> 12:33.167
.

12:35.700 --> 12:35.900
.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.867
Hello! Who wants to see my
Lycra?

12:48.933 --> 12:51.167
My boy has done me proud.

12:51.233 --> 12:55.300
Sam and Chloe are still out
so they must be having a good
time.

12:55.367 --> 12:56.367
(sighs)

12:56.433 --> 12:59.067
Sophie, I'm not gonna lie,
you fucked us.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.867
Hello!
Hello.

13:00.933 --> 13:04.400
Oh. Here's the happy couple.
Hello, hello, hello.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.500
Nathan, what the fuck
are you wearing? Lycra, bitch.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.367
What the fuck are they wearing?

13:09.433 --> 13:12.000
There's a Tour de France team
in the living room.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.067
Was it a good date?
I liked it but it wasn't...

13:15.133 --> 13:17.500
She screamed for the full thing.
I panicked.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.333
We went on a thing in the air.
Parascending.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.933
I would've loved that.
Chloe doesn't know how lucky she
is.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.033
All I got was a sore arse.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.333
I feel like you needed
to have a proper one.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.733
Like a drink?
We'll go for food next. I know.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.000
Sam tried to put a lot of
thought
in the date

13:33.067 --> 13:35.833
but he's ended up
scaring the fuck out of Chloe.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.433
Heights and water? Fuck's sake,
Sam.

13:41.100 --> 13:45.233
Hosting my first ever Toon Tours
night in Tenners. Sounds mint.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.300
I'm loving being part
of this family.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.667
Right, guys.
Howay, then, we'll get ready.

13:49.733 --> 13:51.300
Yeah!
Tours!

13:58.767 --> 14:00.100
Argh!

14:12.733 --> 14:14.800
How nice is this?
I know.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.833
Little dip by the pool with my
lad.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.100
I mean, Chloe's lad.
(chuckles)

14:19.167 --> 14:22.800
After riding that bike in
the bitching heat with a
hangover,

14:22.867 --> 14:23.933
I feel like shite.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.967
But Sam is a Toon Tours party
newbie

14:26.033 --> 14:28.767
so I need to give him a heads up
about tonight.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.800
What is Toon Tours like abroad?

14:30.867 --> 14:34.333
It's wild. You get the punters
in,
get them all pissed.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.167
Play a few naughty games.
Getting
pissed and playing naughty
games?

14:38.233 --> 14:39.533
How is that even work?

14:39.600 --> 14:42.333
It's a job
and somebody has got to do it.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.500
There were slim pickings last
night,
I'm gonna admit.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.933
I just hope there's some fit
lads.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.300
I have had enough
of watching Chloe and Sam neck
on.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.467
And tonight I'm pulling a lad.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.867
Do you not think it's hard to
pull
in these?

14:59.933 --> 15:02.900
I've got a revealing top on.
Let's have a look.

15:02.967 --> 15:07.433
Get your tits out. Ohh!
I actually want to fuck that
tit.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.567
Do ya? I wanna put your nipple
on my clit and fuck it.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.533
Abbie is looking pure lush.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.333
She could do with some attention
so
I really hope that she pulls
tonight

15:16.400 --> 15:18.467
but now let's get to work.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.400
(chanting) Toon Tours, Toon
Tours!

15:21.467 --> 15:24.800
This is Sam and Steph's first
ever
Toon Tour party night.

15:24.867 --> 15:28.500
If they wanna learn a thing or
two
about taking punters on the
piss,

15:28.567 --> 15:30.800
then they have gotta pay
attention.

15:30.867 --> 15:34.033
(dance music)

15:37.467 --> 15:38.533
Yeah!

15:38.600 --> 15:41.500
Hello, everybody!
(all cheering)

15:41.567 --> 15:44.933
What the fuck's going on?
Are yous ready to fucking party?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.767
(all cheering)
The crowd looked really up for
it.

15:47.833 --> 15:51.267
It makes me just wanna get stuck
in
and get some drinks in us.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.067
Who wants a shot?
(all) Yes!

15:53.133 --> 15:54.267
I want one!

15:54.333 --> 15:57.867
To get the party started, we're
gonna
tell them our dirty secrets.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.900
To break the ice,
you know what I mean?

15:59.967 --> 16:03.400
My name's Chloe and I used to be
a lesbian for two years.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.633
And now I'll take my shot.
(cheering)

16:06.700 --> 16:09.667
My name is Steph and I love
shagging in front of people.

16:09.733 --> 16:10.767
Hey!

16:10.833 --> 16:14.033
My name is Sam and I got caught
having sex in a church car park.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
(cheering)
Toon Tours in Tenners!

16:16.067 --> 16:17.367
(cheering)

16:17.433 --> 16:19.133
Let's fucking party!

16:19.200 --> 16:21.100
(dance music)

16:22.533 --> 16:25.100
(cheering and laughter)

16:26.733 --> 16:29.033
(all chanting)
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

16:29.100 --> 16:32.433
After the mountain biking,
I don't feel very well.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.533
It is the last night

16:33.600 --> 16:36.300
and I'm gutted not to be
spending it
with the family

16:36.367 --> 16:39.367
but I'm that ill,
I need to go... home.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.900
I honestly can't do tonight,
I'm really sorry.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.267
Are you going?
I have to.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.733
See you when you get back.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.100
See you later on, mate.
Yeah. Bye.

16:48.167 --> 16:52.200
I'm gutted Nathan's leaving.
That
means I'm the only lad out
tonight.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.800
The lad that I necked on with
in the club the other night

16:58.867 --> 17:01.800
is only here
and I'm feeling really nervous.

17:01.867 --> 17:05.133
I need to get some drinks down
us
and get me some Dutch courage.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.067
Do you still think he's fit?
Yeah.

17:07.133 --> 17:13.032
After all this shit, what's gone
on
between you, Chloe and Sam,

17:13.099 --> 17:14.900
you need to get some attention.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.300
I'm trying to build
Abbie's confidence.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.933
She is a beautiful girl.
That boy fancies her.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.567
She needs to go there tonight.
No offence but he's hotter than
Sam.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.067
I know. He totally is.

17:25.133 --> 17:28.267
Sophie's right. After all the
shit
I had with Chloe and Sam,

17:28.333 --> 17:31.133
it's only right that I pull
myself
a decent lad.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.433
It's mint here, isn't it?
Pure lush.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.667
Very classy, isn't it?
Yeah, I feel like I'm out of
place.

17:39.733 --> 17:43.200
Same. Especially with
this fucking shit top on.
(laughs)

17:43.267 --> 17:45.533
I need to remind Sam
what Anna said earlier.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.300
No necking on with the client.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.667
Anna says
don't neck on with the clients.

17:50.733 --> 17:52.900
I think you should just stick
to that rule

17:52.967 --> 17:55.633
because... she might sack ya.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.367
Oh, yeah, Chloe's just looking
out
for me, right?

17:58.433 --> 18:00.633
I know I'm stupid
but I can see your game.

18:00.700 --> 18:05.000
We will be playing games what
are
very close to the female body.

18:05.067 --> 18:08.000
Yeah. My female body but
other...
Other female bodies.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.867
You can't play cos it is work.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.933
I'll be on my best work
behaviour.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.833
When a girl says to ya,
"Do what you want",

18:16.900 --> 18:20.433
do not do what you fucking want
because she will kill ya.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.500
Should we go back in there, get
some
games going? Yup, howay, then.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.033
Right. Eat the melon out.
(cheering)

18:31.100 --> 18:34.533
This game has me sticking
a watermelon between my legs.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.633
Thank God I had a wash
before I came out.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.033
You've got 30 seconds
to eat as much pussy as you can.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.567
One, two, three, go!
(chanting) Eat it, eat it, eat
it!

18:43.633 --> 18:45.133
Oh, my God, I'm getting wet!

18:45.200 --> 18:47.867
Seeing the boy she fancies
between her legs,

18:47.933 --> 18:51.767
with a melon, eating it out has
got
to give her some kind of
confidence.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.367
Have a good chew, love!

18:53.433 --> 18:56.800
I was hoping to have a
conversation
with Ben face-to-face,

18:56.867 --> 18:58.367
not face-to-vagina.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.933
(all) Three, two, one!

19:01.000 --> 19:02.100
(all cheering)

19:02.167 --> 19:05.133
Think the winner, quite
evidently,
is yous two.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.233
(cheering)

19:07.900 --> 19:09.933
Toon Tours is fucking amazing.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.333
I can't believe they call this
work.

19:13.067 --> 19:16.467
Who likes fucking sex positions?
Me!

19:16.533 --> 19:18.500
I wanna see as many sex
positions

19:18.567 --> 19:21.633
that you can do
in 20 fucking seconds.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.300
I've been paired up with the lad
I've got my eye on.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.333
Who doesn't love
a try before you buy?

19:26.400 --> 19:28.800
Any single girls in the house?
Hiya.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.733
Who the fuck is this vag packet
getting paired with my lad?

19:32.800 --> 19:33.967
I'm fucking fuming!

19:34.033 --> 19:36.633
Go!
(cheering and laughter)

19:36.700 --> 19:38.533
Me turn over?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.867
What's that?
Who's trying to shag me?

19:40.933 --> 19:43.933
I'm very aware that
Chloe is staring right at me

19:44.000 --> 19:46.067
so I am keeping this PG.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.767
Go! Keep going!

19:49.133 --> 19:52.833
Three, two, one!
(cheering and applause)

19:52.900 --> 19:55.133
If these moves
are anything to go by,

19:55.200 --> 19:57.433
I hope this lad
comes to the club later.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.233
We have a clear winner here.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.667
Yes to these two!

20:01.733 --> 20:04.267
Aw, Sam lost. What a fucking
shame.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.733
(cheering and applause)

20:05.800 --> 20:08.300
I've loved
my first Toon Tours night at
work

20:08.367 --> 20:11.133
but now it's time
to get the real party started.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.133
To the club!

20:21.267 --> 20:23.567
(all cheering)

20:27.800 --> 20:30.333
We get to the club
and it's fucking buzzing.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.600
I love being part
of this mental family.

20:44.633 --> 20:48.267
Once again, Sophie is grilling
me
but after that date today,

20:48.333 --> 20:51.767
I hope she now realises
that I genuinely do like Chloe.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.933
Oh, my God.
Sam thinks that tonight...

20:59.000 --> 21:00.067
is the night.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.400
I can't keep this a secret.
I'm gonna have to tell Chloe.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.433
Sophie's come over and she wants
to
find out all about Sam.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.733
No problem.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.967
I'm over the moon
that Chloe is finally happy.

21:47.033 --> 21:50.167
Especially after everything
she went through with Marty.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.233
She deserves some happiness.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.833
Soph, do not tease me.

21:59.900 --> 22:03.367
Cos my flaps are going pure
radge
for Sam's chopper.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.100
(both chanting)

22:11.600 --> 22:14.067
Oh, my God. I've just seen the
lad

22:14.133 --> 22:16.133
that I necked on with
the other night.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.100
And he's brought his mate.
Steph, look lively.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.600
It's the last night in Tenerife

22:25.667 --> 22:29.267
and finally, me and Abbie have
got
ourselves some decent lads.

22:31.533 --> 22:33.867
I'm so glad
Abbie has pulled that lad again.

22:33.933 --> 22:36.167
Now me and Chloe
don't have to feel guilty

22:36.233 --> 22:38.133
about putting it on in front of
her.

22:44.100 --> 22:47.967
Finally, I've got Ben in the
club
and he's laying it on pretty
thick.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.300
I can't say
I don't like the attention,

22:50.367 --> 22:54.100
especially after my confidence
was knocked with Chloe and Sam.

23:02.933 --> 23:06.867
Where's my Nathan? Whilst
all these divvies are pulling,

23:06.933 --> 23:08.100
I need my playmate.

23:15.667 --> 23:18.167
It's our last night in Tenners
so it's only right

23:18.233 --> 23:20.367
we end a holiday with a bang.

23:22.133 --> 23:25.000
Obviously I do want you
but I need to play it cool.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.000
She's gonna have to run
a lot faster than that

23:41.067 --> 23:43.067
if we wanna get
to the shag pad first.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.100
(all cheering)

23:46.167 --> 23:48.833
Why the fuck is Sam in my bed?

23:48.900 --> 23:51.100
Shit. I hope I didn't wank him
off.

23:52.533 --> 23:53.933
(shouting)

23:54.000 --> 23:56.600
Attention from a fit lad
and a cheeky finger.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.933
What more could a girl ask for?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Geordie Shore, wye aye!

24:03.467 --> 24:03.667
.

24:06.200 --> 24:06.400
.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.367
(dance music)

24:19.167 --> 24:21.833
Everyone is pure blingoed.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.900
I need to get back
and get some scran.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.767
There is no way
I am letting go of Ben tonight.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.767
Both of the lads are coming back
to the villa with us.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.900
Welcome to my house.

24:41.933 --> 24:44.433
I've just heard
the little radgies come home.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.500
They better leave me alone
cos I still feel like shite.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.667
See ya tomorrow, bitches.

24:49.733 --> 24:53.033
Wow. Nothing better than
coming into a nice house,

24:53.100 --> 24:54.833
with some nice, hot nuggets.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.700
(shouting)

24:58.800 --> 25:01.067
That lot can stuff their faces
if they want

25:01.133 --> 25:04.467
but me and Steph are getting
straight in the pool with our
lads.

25:07.067 --> 25:10.967
Oh, my God! It's freezing!
Oh, my God!

25:12.100 --> 25:14.267
How's your night been?
Do you know?

25:14.333 --> 25:16.033
I have had a really good night.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.767
Work wasn't even fucking work.
I enjoyed it.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.633
There was a lot of pretty girls
at the work today.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.367
What did I do?
You did nothing.

25:23.433 --> 25:26.833
I really appreciate the way you
were.
It was very respectful.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.667
Didn't even look at another
girl.

25:28.733 --> 25:33.233
Tonight at work Sam was so
respectful
and that makes me like him even
more.

25:33.300 --> 25:36.967
I find ya very funny.
Like, you make us laugh all the
time.

25:37.033 --> 25:40.200
I really enjoy your company.
Normally, I get very bored.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.733
I can still talk to you all
night.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.433
It's almost like I've got
feelings.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.833
Almost being a very big word.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.000
Almost.

25:50.067 --> 25:53.633
Maybe the pool
was a fucking bad idea.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.100
Sam and Chloe
have had the shag pad enough.

25:56.167 --> 25:57.467
Tonight it's my turn.

26:04.733 --> 26:07.867
Chloe's love of nuggets
has just lost us the shag pad.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.433
Fuck knows where
I'm sleeping tonight.

26:11.667 --> 26:14.933
This fella's a nice lad
but I'm absolutely knackered.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.200
I've been to work
and I've been to the club.

26:17.267 --> 26:18.833
I just wanna go to sleep.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.400
My last night in Tenerife
has been mint.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.500
I've got a fit lad
and I've stolen the shag pad.

26:28.567 --> 26:32.133
Chloe and Sam are gonna have to
sleep somewhere else.

26:55.833 --> 26:57.400
So, where's your boy gone?

26:57.467 --> 26:59.633
I don't know,
I think he's gone home.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.967
Where's your boy?
Think he just went home.

27:02.033 --> 27:03.500
Did anything happen?

27:03.567 --> 27:05.667
Think I was really drunk
and passed out.

27:05.733 --> 27:07.767
Did you neck on in the bedroom?
No.

27:08.767 --> 27:11.067
This is starting to become
a regular thing.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.033
I think Steph just loves to
spoon.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.133
What about you?
Oh.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.933
Right, well, I think... I think
he
was trying to go in for the
finger.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.600
I got a swift rub.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.300
But then I think I fell asleep
as well.

27:24.367 --> 27:26.200
Last night was just what I
needed.

27:26.267 --> 27:29.067
Attention from a fit lad
and a cheeky finger.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.300
What more could a girl ask for?

27:33.167 --> 27:34.867
Good morning!

27:34.933 --> 27:38.667
I've woke up this morning
and Sam's in my bed.

27:38.733 --> 27:41.067
Shit. I hope I didn't wank him
off.

27:41.133 --> 27:44.100
Why the fuck is Sam in my bed?

27:44.167 --> 27:46.467
Wherever I go, Sam goes.

27:46.533 --> 27:50.400
I got the fear.
Thought I'd done something with
Sam.

27:50.467 --> 27:52.200
(laughs)
I wonder how Nathan is.

27:52.267 --> 27:54.400
With the rest all on the pull
last night,

27:54.467 --> 27:55.967
I really missed Nathan.

27:56.033 --> 27:58.700
So I'm gonna make sure
that he's all right today.

28:00.833 --> 28:02.800
Good morning, you.

28:02.867 --> 28:05.000
What's that?
Just some lemon and water.

28:05.067 --> 28:06.933
It'll settle your stomach.

28:07.867 --> 28:10.000
How are you?
Feel better now.

28:10.067 --> 28:13.033
Oh, good. I think you just
needed
that one night.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.200
Was it a good night?

28:14.267 --> 28:17.400
It was good but it would've been
better if you were there.

28:17.467 --> 28:19.833
Abbie pulled a fit boy.
Right.

28:19.900 --> 28:22.733
He was at work
and she brought him back.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.233
Now that Abbie's got the
attention
she wanted,

28:25.300 --> 28:28.400
hopefully she'll relax and
realise
she doesn't need a man

28:28.467 --> 28:30.633
and definitely not a man named
Sam.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.067
Steph pulled as well.

28:32.133 --> 28:33.633
She brought a boy back.

28:33.700 --> 28:36.167
You needed to be there.
I felt so alone.

28:36.233 --> 28:40.700
Why? I was just, like,
the fucking fifth wheel.

28:40.767 --> 28:44.567
I've got no Marnie,
no Aaron, no Gary.

28:44.633 --> 28:45.867
No me.
And no you.

28:45.933 --> 28:49.467
Even without Aaron and Marnie,
we've had a wicked time in
Tenerife.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.833
I'm a bit gutted that
I missed the last night

28:51.900 --> 28:53.800
but I'm gonna make up for it
at home.

28:56.933 --> 29:00.533
It's the last day in Tenners, we
need to pack. Get your glad rags
on.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.367
I didn't feel like I had my
family
around us last night

29:03.433 --> 29:06.200
so I've got a mint idea
that'll solve that today.

29:06.267 --> 29:09.267
Let's go to the beach!
(all cheering)

29:14.500 --> 29:16.133
Bosh.

29:19.267 --> 29:22.500
Oh, shit.
(all cheering)

29:25.800 --> 29:26.800
Shit!

29:30.633 --> 29:33.833
Come on, kids. Last day in
Tenners.
Get out.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.300
Why are you such a goblin?
Get yourself out.

29:36.367 --> 29:37.933
It's our last day in Tenerife

29:38.000 --> 29:42.667
and what better way to end it
than going mad at the beach
club?

29:47.767 --> 29:49.000
Howay for a cocktail.

29:49.067 --> 29:53.533
Give me a long, slow screw
on the beach.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.800
Right, we need to know
all about the lads.

29:55.867 --> 29:57.000
Tell us everything.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.267
We got home, went to the shag
pad.

29:59.333 --> 30:02.767
A lot of passionate necking on.
(gasps) I'm not ready for this.

30:02.833 --> 30:04.400
I'm nervous for ya.

30:04.467 --> 30:07.333
Everyone take a drink.
Everyone take a drink.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.567
There was a finger. Oh.
Whilst fingering...

30:10.633 --> 30:13.000
I fell asleep.
(all) What?!

30:13.067 --> 30:16.067
So he fingered you
and you fell asleep. Yeah.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.600
Fuck off, you lot.
I pulled a ten in Tenners.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.200
That's just what I needed
to forget about Sam.

30:21.267 --> 30:25.333
Who was yours? I'm gutted, mate.
I didn't even neck on with him.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.500
(all) Oh! What?!

30:26.567 --> 30:29.900
What is wrong with that girl?
That's two nights in a row.

30:29.967 --> 30:32.433
So, us three
slept in a single fucking bed

30:32.500 --> 30:34.567
and yous two didn't do nothing?

30:34.633 --> 30:38.433
I can't believe it! Fucking
hell.
Frigid fucking Fridas, all of
them!

30:38.500 --> 30:40.733
(laughter)
I hold my hands up to it.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.967
I am now Frigid Steph.

30:43.033 --> 30:46.033
I wanna go in the pool.
Anyone wanna come? I'll come.

30:46.100 --> 30:49.533
Why don't we get some more
drinks
while they go in the pool? Yeah.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.700
Shall we go for six daiquiris?
Thank you.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.433
When we first came into the
house,

30:55.500 --> 30:58.100
me and you obviously
had a little bit of a thing.

30:58.167 --> 31:01.467
I don't want you to feel awkward
cos I started with Chloe.

31:01.533 --> 31:05.133
Yeah. Obviously, I don't.
The weird thing is it was at
first.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.633
Yeah. Now, like, I think
we get on as friends.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.367
Yeah.
It's not awkward.

31:09.433 --> 31:11.600
That's what I like to hear,
guys.

31:11.667 --> 31:14.900
I can't lie, I have been feeling
a bit awkward and envious

31:14.967 --> 31:18.133
of what Chloe and Sam have
but I pulled a lad last night

31:18.200 --> 31:20.333
so hopefully, things are looking
up.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.267
I need to try
and get Sam's attention

31:32.333 --> 31:35.733
so I'm gonna lie on this rock
like I'm some kind of mermaid.

31:38.567 --> 31:41.500
There's being sexy
and then there's Chloe.

31:41.567 --> 31:45.067
And believe you,
it's all kinds of wrong.

31:46.567 --> 31:50.700
I feel like we're all gonna go
back
to Newcastle with a very tight
bond.

31:50.767 --> 31:52.333
And with a very tight tan.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.867
And with a very tight vagina
if I don't get any sex. Hey-hey!

32:05.267 --> 32:07.133
We've got you some drinks.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.867
(all) Cheers!

32:08.933 --> 32:13.233
It's our last few hours in
Tenerife
so let's make the fucking most
of it!

32:13.300 --> 32:14.733
Woo-hoo!

32:24.867 --> 32:26.333
Today has been wicked.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.733
Sun, cocktails and the family.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
Tenerife has been immense.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.967
Woo!

32:33.033 --> 32:35.600
Why do yous all wanna go?
I wanna fucking stay.

32:35.667 --> 32:36.700
Let's go!

32:36.767 --> 32:39.200
Who wants to stay?
(all cheer)

32:39.267 --> 32:41.633
Who wants to go home?
Hey!

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
Ooh.
Oh.

32:42.767 --> 32:45.133
I have loved every single minute
of Tenerife

32:45.200 --> 32:47.833
but I need to get back to the
Toon
cos I want a kebab.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.067
I wanna smell Newcastle air.
(sniffs)

32:55.167 --> 32:56.833
Quick, come on!

32:56.900 --> 32:59.933
Thank flying fuck,
we made our flight.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.267
Next stop, "Nurr-err-kerr,
whuh-assur-tuh-elle-urr."

33:04.333 --> 33:06.967
That spells Newcastle!

33:07.033 --> 33:08.967
I don't know if I spelled that
right.

33:11.733 --> 33:13.033
We are fucking back.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.767
Ayah! Ya bastard.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.833
Has he caught fucking feelings?

33:19.900 --> 33:21.167
Food fight!

33:21.233 --> 33:22.333
No!

33:22.400 --> 33:25.200
Don't mind me.
Why is Abbie cock-blocking us?

33:25.267 --> 33:27.600
Geordie Shore, wye aye!

33:29.967 --> 33:30.167
.

33:32.667 --> 33:32.867
.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.467
God, it's fucking freezing!
Fuck me, it's Baltic.

33:46.533 --> 33:48.500
Quick, let's get back to the
house!

33:48.567 --> 33:50.467
Let's go!

33:53.700 --> 33:56.633
Hello, home.
Home, sweet home.

33:57.767 --> 34:00.800
Ugh. Well, the house
is still a mess.

34:00.867 --> 34:04.600
I was hoping that Aaron and
Marnie
were gonna be here when we got
home.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.367
The family's just not the same
without those two.

34:07.433 --> 34:11.400
We are back in the Toon and
I am not having any holiday
blues.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.533
I'm going out
and getting pure mortal.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.433
(groans)

34:19.367 --> 34:22.300
Tenerife was great for me.
I got to get closer to Chloe.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.500
I cleared things up with Abbie.
It's a win-win all around.

34:27.632 --> 34:31.067
I hope you don't feel awkward
about the me and Chloe
situation.

34:31.132 --> 34:33.400
At the end of the day,
it wasn't a game for me.

34:33.467 --> 34:36.400
I was getting to know Abbie
and Chloe to see who I liked,

34:36.467 --> 34:39.533
which was Chloe.
I hope Abbie understands that
now.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.367
We planned that night.
"We'll go to the shag pad."

34:42.433 --> 34:44.600
No.
"Let's see where it goes."

34:44.667 --> 34:47.266
Insinuating sex. Yeah.

34:47.333 --> 34:51.266
But I'd rather her know it's not
just about the sex, you know?

34:51.333 --> 34:53.600
It's not a holiday romance.
No.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.632
It's not just a one-night stand.
No.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.667
It's not about getting punani.
No.

34:57.733 --> 35:00.533
It's more than that?
I didn't think it would be.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.533
Has he caught fucking feelings?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.633
Finally, my little sister
has got a decent lad.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.900
And too right cos she deserves
one.

35:07.967 --> 35:12.600
Am I allowed to tell Chloe that?
No. Cos I'll look like a fanny.

35:14.867 --> 35:18.433
Do you know what? I feel like
I was a bit down in Tenerife

35:18.500 --> 35:22.367
but I had that little holiday
romance, I had a proper
pick-me-up.

35:22.433 --> 35:25.300
I'm so happy that
Abbie pulled a lad in Tenerife.

35:25.367 --> 35:28.800
Now we're back, me and Sam
can crack on without feeling
bad.

35:28.867 --> 35:31.433
Because it's our first night
back
in Newcastle,

35:31.500 --> 35:34.033
we should make it a girls night.
Yeah. Should we?

35:34.100 --> 35:37.300
Girls one. Proper girls.
All about the fucking lasses!

35:37.367 --> 35:39.433
Oi, oi! All about the fanny!
(laughs)

35:40.833 --> 35:43.400
Ladies!
Let's go!

35:43.467 --> 35:44.700
(all cheering)

35:45.600 --> 35:48.933
I come downstairs and Sam
has already got the shots lined
up.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.767
This is gonna be one messy
night.

35:50.833 --> 35:54.100
To the Toon!
(all cheering and shouting)

35:55.300 --> 35:57.367
There's no time to lose
so let's get out

35:57.433 --> 36:00.633
and show Newcastle that
we're radgier than ever.

36:00.700 --> 36:05.400
Get your fucking arse in there.
Get
in the fucking car, I'm
freezing!

36:06.733 --> 36:08.100
(shouting)

36:08.167 --> 36:11.933
We should make sure that we show
Newcastle that we are fucking
back.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.733
Oi, oi.
Let's go, bitches!

36:14.800 --> 36:15.867
(dance music)

36:22.533 --> 36:23.567
(all cheering)

36:23.633 --> 36:27.767
(chanting) Bijoux, Bijoux.
We're in Bijoux.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.633
I really missed Nathan last
night
in Tenerife

36:45.700 --> 36:48.800
so I'm glad that he's back out
with me tonight.

37:09.267 --> 37:12.533
Chloe has been messed over
by nearly every lad she's got
with

37:12.600 --> 37:15.100
and she needs to realise that
Sam
isn't the same

37:15.167 --> 37:16.833
as them other little fuckers.

37:27.533 --> 37:30.467
That makes me feel so special
cos I feel the same.

37:39.367 --> 37:41.100
I proper messed up our last
date.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.467
Now we're back,
I wanna make this up to Chloe

37:43.533 --> 37:45.567
and take her on a proper nice
date.

37:51.467 --> 37:53.200
Yes!

37:57.500 --> 37:59.067
(laughs)

37:59.133 --> 38:02.033
I can't believe Sam has asked me
on a second date.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.200
This is like a fairy-tale.
I'm Fiona and he's my Shrek.

38:05.267 --> 38:07.933
But he's sexier and skinnier.
And not green!

38:21.967 --> 38:25.167
Chloe's worried that things
are gonna change now we're back

38:25.233 --> 38:27.967
so this date is my chance
to show her otherwise.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.367
I'm so happy
for them two little divvies

38:32.433 --> 38:34.500
cos they're meant for each
other.

38:43.900 --> 38:46.633
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm gutted Aaron isn't back.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.933
We're a bit short on fit lads
in the house.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.500
Steph secretly wants Aaron
to come back single

38:58.567 --> 39:02.067
but I hate to break it to ya,
he's going straight for Marnie.

39:06.433 --> 39:08.633
Steph has got a lot
of fighting talk.

39:08.700 --> 39:11.433
But she hasn't seen
my Marns kick off

39:11.500 --> 39:14.567
and believe me,
that's the last thing you wanna
see.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.633
Oww!

39:24.733 --> 39:26.867
Tenners was amazing
with these radgies

39:26.933 --> 39:29.400
but there's no place
we'd rather be than home.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.800
Get in and fucking shut up.

39:37.867 --> 39:41.200
(slurring) So, I've lost my
shirt
and I don't give a shit.

39:41.267 --> 39:43.867
Might take my fucking
shoes off as well.

39:43.933 --> 39:47.667
Right now everyone in this car
is sexy.

39:49.833 --> 39:51.733
Oh, no.

39:55.867 --> 39:57.733
Hey!

39:57.800 --> 40:00.200
(gasps) Oh, my God. Heaven.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.600
Ayah! Ya bastard!

40:04.667 --> 40:06.033
(growls)

40:06.100 --> 40:10.367
We're back at home and what
rounds
off a good night

40:10.433 --> 40:14.300
than food being thrown
in your fucking face?

40:15.400 --> 40:16.533
Food fight!

40:16.600 --> 40:17.633
(screaming)

40:19.867 --> 40:21.067
Nathan, a kebab!

40:21.133 --> 40:23.900
Try your fucking best.
Whoa!

40:23.967 --> 40:26.067
If you wanna be part of this
family,

40:26.133 --> 40:28.700
then you fucking get involved
in the fight!

40:30.733 --> 40:34.100
What's with it with all these
lot
and fucking food fights?

40:34.167 --> 40:35.600
Don't waste the kebab.

40:36.567 --> 40:37.633
No!

40:38.833 --> 40:41.333
How do you like your fucking
eggs,
bitch?

40:41.400 --> 40:43.500
Nathan has just hit an egg
off my fanny.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.833
I feel like a chicken.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.333
Five second rule.
Ohh!

40:47.400 --> 40:50.167
Cluck, cluck, cluck,
motherfucker!

40:50.233 --> 40:52.000
(laughter)

40:52.067 --> 40:53.600
Dodge!

40:53.667 --> 40:55.767
No!

40:55.833 --> 40:58.833
Chicken, motherfucking bitch.
Surrender!

40:58.900 --> 41:01.700
You've wasted all this fucking
food
that I wanna eat.

41:01.767 --> 41:04.000
I've never known a family like
this.

41:04.067 --> 41:06.033
We're out every night getting
mortal

41:06.100 --> 41:09.133
and now we're having a mother
of all food fights. Get in.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.767
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me?!

41:12.833 --> 41:14.633
This is the perfect opportunity

41:14.700 --> 41:17.867
for me and Chloe
to slip off into the shower.

41:20.833 --> 41:24.800
Throwing all this food
has made me very hungry

41:24.867 --> 41:27.400
and I don't want any of it
to go to waste.

41:27.467 --> 41:28.833
I'm gonna have to eat it.

41:33.067 --> 41:34.833
Oh, my God!

41:34.900 --> 41:38.133
Me and Sam are getting pure
freaky
and Abbie's just walked in.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.533
What do you want?!

41:48.700 --> 41:51.200
I don't care
if I'm cock-blocking Sam and
Chloe

41:51.267 --> 41:53.167
cos they've got the shag pad
for that

41:53.233 --> 41:55.733
and I need to get this food
off of me.

42:00.533 --> 42:02.800
I thought we got this sorted
in Tenerife.

42:02.867 --> 42:06.167
Why is Abbie cock-blocking us?
She needs to get the hint.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.500
I need to shower
but I'm that fucked, I can't
stand.

42:14.567 --> 42:17.733
So I guess
I'm having a sit-down shower.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.133
It's been a wicked night

42:19.200 --> 42:22.167
and Nathan has finally stopped
throwing food around

42:22.233 --> 42:25.300
so now all the family
is gonna have a sleepover.

42:25.367 --> 42:28.000
You wanna stick it in my
asshole,
bitch? Yes!

42:28.067 --> 42:31.167
Yes! Put it in!
(all cheering and chanting)

42:31.233 --> 42:34.300
If my boyfriend could see me
now,
he wouldn't be happy.

42:34.367 --> 42:37.400
But he's not here so weeey!

42:37.467 --> 42:38.467
(laughter)

42:40.700 --> 42:43.200
That curling tong
is very special to us.

42:43.267 --> 42:47.100
It cost us £14.99 so what is it
doing
up Nathan's arse?!

42:47.167 --> 42:49.300
Gimme! (screams)

42:49.367 --> 42:50.900
(squeals)

42:50.967 --> 42:53.533
It's been a very weird
but wicked night.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.400
That's family night at its best.

42:55.467 --> 42:57.567
But now we need to get some
sleep.

43:02.933 --> 43:04.767
(all cheer)

43:04.833 --> 43:06.100
Let's do this, bitches!

43:06.167 --> 43:09.100
You like chicken, don't ya?
Chicken fucking Cottage?!

43:09.167 --> 43:12.433
There's enough sperm in me
to get all of Newcastle
pregnant.

43:12.500 --> 43:15.767
Oh, my God.
That was quicker than expected.

43:18.933 --> 43:21.533
If you leave this house,
that is me and you done.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.933
Fucking shit!

43:24.000 --> 43:26.533
I'm now babysitting Sophie.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.000
I have ruined something so
special.

43:29.067 --> 43:31.100
Shag pad now.

43:31.167 --> 43:32.600
# Everyone's here to party

43:32.667 --> 43:34.667
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go wild

43:34.733 --> 43:36.267
# Everyone's here to party

43:36.333 --> 43:38.533
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go

43:38.600 --> 43:40.033
# Everyone's here to party

43:40.100 --> 43:42.200
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go wild

43:42.267 --> 43:43.767
# Everyone's here to party

43:43.833 --> 43:44.967
# Let's party, party

43:45.033 --> 43:46.800
# Let's party hard

43:46.867 --> 43:48.600
# You wanna go party, oi, oi

43:48.667 --> 43:50.500
# Party hard

43:50.567 --> 43:53.600
# We're gonna go all night
All night, all night, all night
#

43:56.433 --> 43:56.633
.
