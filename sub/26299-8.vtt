WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.639
Why aren't you talking,
are you mad at me?

00:05.673 --> 00:08.008
No! I'm freaked because I just
found out that I'm pregnant.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.810
And yes,
I am a little mad at you,

00:09.843 --> 00:11.079
because this is serious,

00:11.112 --> 00:12.346
and the only thing
that you can think about

00:12.380 --> 00:14.582
is combining our names
into the perfect baby name.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.850
Well, now we know
it's either Hayden or Dyley.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.987
Look,
this is a beautiful thing.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.555
A product of our love.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.524
It is a product of our love,
right?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.093
Yes, Dylan.
I did the math.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.260
Last time
you did the math

00:26.294 --> 00:28.362
we accidentally left
a $300 tip.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.663
Oh, I don't know
what to do.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.100
(sighs)
How about this?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.668
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy...

00:34.702 --> 00:35.736
will you marry me?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.505
Are you kidding me
right now?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.173
Picture us walking
down the aisle,

00:39.207 --> 00:41.509
a breathtaking vision
in virginal white

00:41.542 --> 00:43.010
and you wearing
whatever you want.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.878
I'm not marrying you!
Okay.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.780
Okay,
one step at a time.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.717
We'll put you on vitamins
and a healthy diet.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.051
You'll be eating
for one now.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.122
Score! Lollipops!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.356
How am I gonna tell
my mom?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.890
This is the one thing
she always told me not to do,

00:56.924 --> 00:58.526
and you're the person
she told me not to do it with.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.294
Yeah, she really nailed
that one.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.062
I hope our baby
gets her brain.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.764
Why aren't you
freaking out?

01:03.797 --> 01:06.134
Because this is
a good thing,

01:06.167 --> 01:07.201
isn't it?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.769
I...

01:08.802 --> 01:09.737
I don't know.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.139
Ugh. (sighs)

01:11.172 --> 01:12.940
Oh, my God,
I have to get to work.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.375
To a job that I love,
which I don't even know

01:14.408 --> 01:15.809
if I can do with a baby!
(chuckles)

01:15.843 --> 01:17.211
Just -- I, um...

01:17.245 --> 01:19.613
I need some space.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.714
Oh.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.750
$13, carry the 3...

01:22.783 --> 01:23.917
Leave a $50.

01:23.951 --> 01:29.757
**

01:29.790 --> 01:35.663
**

01:37.097 --> 01:38.732
(whistle blows)
CAMERON: All right, Thompson,
run a crisp route!

01:38.766 --> 01:40.234
Pitkowski, go!

01:40.268 --> 01:42.002
Look at them out there.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.904
They are a mess.
No focus!

01:43.937 --> 01:45.673
You told them about
not eating chicken, right?

01:45.706 --> 01:46.774
It's a nervous bird.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.609
Before the game,
you eat your calm mammals,

01:48.642 --> 01:50.077
your beefs,
your muttons.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.412
Okay, guys, get in here!

01:51.445 --> 01:52.646
Let's go. Huddle up!

01:52.680 --> 01:54.615
CAMERON: We're about to play
for the city championship,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.784
and Jay here
has been helping out.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.152
I've been a team booster
for years.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.987
Usually that means
cutting a check

02:00.020 --> 02:02.423
from the Pritchett Cares
Foundation.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.091
We support athletics

02:04.124 --> 02:07.795
and we educate at-risk youth
about careers in closets.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.330
It's a real path out.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.432
Okay, this is the biggest day
of your lives

02:11.465 --> 02:14.968
and you're looking like a bunch
of little girls out there!

02:15.002 --> 02:18.138
What's wrong, Pitkowski,
did you forget your Barbies?!

02:18.172 --> 02:21.775
Coach, we've been talking,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.143
and the language
you've been using lately

02:23.177 --> 02:24.978
feels, well, hurtful.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.113
And sexist.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.481
And a little
gender reductive.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.949
What the hell
is happening?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.050
We'd just like you
to consider

02:30.083 --> 02:31.852
adopting
a more empowering style.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.054
Okay, you know what?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.657
This is football!

02:36.690 --> 02:39.059
What's wrong, are your
training bras too tight?!

02:39.092 --> 02:40.694
(megaphone squeals)
Coach Tucker!

02:40.728 --> 02:43.231
Please see me
in my office now!

02:43.264 --> 02:44.998
No, honey, I don't want
to pick your sister up

02:45.032 --> 02:46.033
at the airport!

02:46.066 --> 02:48.669
Oh, sorry, I'm talking
to my girlfriend

02:48.702 --> 02:51.205
and I accidentally kept
the megaphone button pressed!

02:51.239 --> 02:52.640
(chuckles) She's really
been riding me lately,

02:52.673 --> 02:53.674
let me tell you!

02:53.707 --> 02:54.742
Oh, no sweetheart, no,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.143
I didn't mean for you
to hear that!

02:56.176 --> 02:58.912
No, no, no,
you're my everything! Of course!

02:58.946 --> 03:01.882
(both vocalizing
"The Imperial March"
from Star Wars)

03:07.588 --> 03:09.089
I got tickets
for me and Mitchell

03:09.122 --> 03:12.360
to a screening in Palm Springs
of The Empire Strikes Back --

03:12.393 --> 03:14.362
Q&A to follow
with the biggest star of all --

03:14.395 --> 03:15.696
George Lucas.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.565
I'm super stoked
because I kind of think of Mitch

03:17.598 --> 03:19.700
as the brother I never had.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.669
I don't know why we don't spend
more time alone together.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.836
It's nobody's fault.
Except for --

03:22.870 --> 03:24.438
for Cam and Claire.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.740
You know, I'm as happy now
as I've ever been.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.075
And look,
we're in Yucaipa.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.577
That sounds like
how Ewoks talk.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.546
I used to sneak off to a gay bar
in Yucaipa before I came out.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.615
Huh, you don't really think of
gay bars as a small-town thing.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.683
Oh, yeah.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.385
They serve your rural gays,

03:37.418 --> 03:39.186
your closeted gays,
your city newbies

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
looking to get
their gay sea-legs,

03:41.221 --> 03:44.024
kind of like an out-of-town
tryout before they hit Broadway.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.560
See, I learn something
whenever I spend time with you.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.362
Remember when you told me
not to snap when I dance?

03:48.396 --> 03:51.465
It looked like you were
trying to get peanut butter
off your fingers.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.467
Speaking of which,
I'm starving.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.436
That bar actually has
amazing hamburgers

03:55.469 --> 03:56.737
if you want to stop
for lunch?

03:56.770 --> 03:57.938
Am I allowed in?

03:57.971 --> 03:58.972
Who's gonna know?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.375
Just don't snap.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.543
Ooh!

04:02.576 --> 04:04.378
Do you think
I could rock this?

04:04.412 --> 04:05.646
Do people
still say rock?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.381
It makes me sad
when you have to ask me

04:07.415 --> 04:09.049
what young people say.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.651
CLAIRE: Alex? Gloria?
Ahh!

04:10.684 --> 04:12.052
Hmm.
Hi.
Um, hi!

04:12.085 --> 04:13.621
What are you doing here?

04:13.654 --> 04:15.122
I needed some sexy clothes,

04:15.155 --> 04:17.391
so I asked Gloria
to help me shop.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.492
No offense to my mom,

04:18.526 --> 04:20.661
but she dresses
kind of conservative

04:20.694 --> 04:21.995
while Gloria knows
how to pick out clothes

04:22.029 --> 04:23.063
that will help...

04:23.096 --> 04:25.633
take this baby
for a spin.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.000
Ugh, Alex, come on,

04:27.034 --> 04:29.102
sell it if you're gonna talk
like that.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.404
Just stopped
by the cobbler

04:30.438 --> 04:32.640
to get my penny loafers
re-soled.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.476
(chuckles)
Same pair for 30 years.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.510
What are you guys doing?

04:36.544 --> 04:37.945
Oh, we're just --
Uh, no, we, uh,

04:37.978 --> 04:40.113
were shopping separately,
funniest thing,

04:40.147 --> 04:42.249
and we just bumped
into each other!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
Right?

04:43.317 --> 04:46.320
(laughs)
Yes, it was hilarious.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.490
I was shopping, and --
and then all she said.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.024
(both chuckle)
It was funny.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.125
So, what did you buy?

04:52.159 --> 04:53.994
Oh, no, no, no.
It's -- It's not mine.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.863
It's hers.
Could you hold it for a minute?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.331
My arms are tired!

04:57.365 --> 04:59.833
(scoffs)
This one, the Queen of Sheba.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.268
We all work for her.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.603
(laughter)

05:02.636 --> 05:04.505
We have fun.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.974
Mmm!

05:07.007 --> 05:07.941
Burger's amazing.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.643
This place is great.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.111
These small town gays
have it made.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.013
Yeah, I mean, they're forced
to live in the shadows,

05:13.046 --> 05:15.315
but they do get to eat fries,
so...

05:15.349 --> 05:16.350
Oh, my God!

05:16.384 --> 05:18.051
Is that Gil Thorpe?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.286
We don't all know each other,
Phil.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.287
With the beard.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.389
There are no women
in here.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.023
Right there,
he's my nemesis.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.625
What could he possibly be
doing here?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.994
Hmm,
I might have a theory.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.396
Oh, my God!

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
He's pretending to be gay.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.331
No.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.501
What is your game, Gil?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.072
Oh, is Nicole coming in
soon?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.741
Her sound bath ran late.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.842
Is there
a special occasion?

05:41.875 --> 05:42.843
Why the party sub?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.178
Uh, this is
a normal sandwich.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.414
(chuckles)

05:46.447 --> 05:48.482
Hello, Haley.
Hi.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.150
Why the enormous sandwich?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.052
This is an ordinary...
doesn't matter.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.521
Uh, Nicole,
can I have a minute?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.255
Of course.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.858
Uh...

05:57.891 --> 06:00.594
Look, a situation
has come up

06:00.628 --> 06:01.729
and it's pretty confusing.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.831
I'm still trying
to process it, but I --

06:03.864 --> 06:05.499
Preggo?
What?!

06:05.533 --> 06:07.735
Oh, God, I knew it!
What?!

06:07.768 --> 06:10.270
I mean, Prego, you know,
however you pronounce

06:10.303 --> 06:12.740
that pretentious
Italian fashion website.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.207
Oh.
Someone told me
that they're trying

06:14.241 --> 06:16.877
to poach one of my employees,
and I am not having it.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.245
So, what do you need?

06:18.278 --> 06:19.847
I, uh, well...

06:19.880 --> 06:23.851
Title bump, money bump --
you are getting a promotion.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.719
(chuckles)
You are gonna be

06:25.753 --> 06:28.188
the new Head of Activewear
and Zeitgeist.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.624
Oh, my God,
this is my dream job.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.626
(laughs)
I told my guidance counselor

06:32.660 --> 06:34.428
that I wanted to do this
and she laughed in my face.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.196
All right, everyone.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.031
Come in,
we're celebrating!

06:38.065 --> 06:41.068
And bring a knife so we can
cut this into 20 pieces!

06:41.802 --> 06:45.806
Coach Tucker, students are
a "protected class"

06:45.839 --> 06:48.108
and it is not okay
for you,

06:48.141 --> 06:50.043
an elite white man
of privilege,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.278
to bully them.

06:51.311 --> 06:54.381
Privilege? I-I make
a teacher's salary. And I'm gay.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.384
Yeah, gay doesn't really get you
the mileage that it used to.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.453
Now, if you were trans,
we'd be golden.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.988
Oh, has the whole world
gone crazy?!

07:01.021 --> 07:02.623
Jay --
No, no, I've had it.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.291
I mean, what,
everyone's so sensitive,

07:04.324 --> 07:06.093
they're gonna ruin
football?

07:06.126 --> 07:09.463
In my day, our team,
the Hamilton Cabbage Eaters,

07:09.497 --> 07:11.298
captained
by Knish Bronstein,

07:11.331 --> 07:13.066
took on
the Lincoln Banditos,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.169
QB'd by
José "Speedy" Gonzales.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.106
And after three hours of
pummeling each other's privates

07:19.139 --> 07:20.808
at the bottom of dog piles,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.743
we shook hands
like brothers

07:22.776 --> 07:24.845
and all went to brawl
the Sausage-Heads

07:24.878 --> 07:26.947
in Pierogi-Town.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.816
America.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.618
(voice breaking)
Beautiful melting pot.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.785
Uh --
How was that your life?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.854
You were in high school
during the Summer of Love.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.157
Coach Tucker, I don't know
why this man is here,

07:37.190 --> 07:39.993
but he's a member of
the "elderly protected class,"

07:40.027 --> 07:42.329
and legally
we can't contradict him.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.798
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to find a gentler way

07:44.832 --> 07:45.966
to motivate your players.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.801
I don't know any other way
to coach.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.171
What we need is advice
from someone who played football

07:51.204 --> 07:54.307
but also is a namby-pamby
Millennial weirdo.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.109
Thank you for coming.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.545
We're here to teach
these gentlemen

07:57.578 --> 07:59.780
how to communicate
in the 21st century.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.215
Let's go around and each say
the gender pronoun we prefer.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.283
I'll start --

08:03.316 --> 08:06.353
I'm cisgender,
he-slash-him.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.021
She-slash-her.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.290
They-slash-them.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.392
Oh, I'm not here to bust chops,
Bob is fine.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.862
This is your rugby team?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.633
I am fascinated
by this mall story of yours...

08:19.667 --> 08:21.835
So, you say
you were shopping?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.470
Yes. (laughs)

08:23.503 --> 08:25.172
You know me and shoes.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.173
(both laugh)

08:26.206 --> 08:28.709
Oh! Well, let's take a look,
why don't we?

08:28.742 --> 08:29.743
(gasps)

08:29.777 --> 08:33.013
Ooh! I had no idea your foot
was so tiny.

08:33.046 --> 08:38.185
Yes, I am so big in the top
and small in the bottom,

08:38.218 --> 08:40.087
like South America
herself.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.221
(laughs)
Aww!

08:41.254 --> 08:42.255
Put 'em on.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.523
Really?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.225
I want to see them
on your feet.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.395
Yes, miss.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.864
I feel like
I am Cinderella.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.667
Go on, let's see you strut
your stuff.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.869
(chuckles)
Pretty shoes.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.338
(gasps)

08:58.371 --> 09:00.240
I've never felt
more beautiful!

09:00.273 --> 09:01.441
Uh-huh.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.543
Okay, I can't watch this
anymore!

09:03.577 --> 09:06.680
Mom, please don't take this
personally,

09:06.714 --> 09:07.948
but I was shopping
with Gloria today

09:07.981 --> 09:10.017
because I wanted to find
something sexy

09:10.050 --> 09:11.451
for my weekend away
with Bill,

09:11.484 --> 09:13.887
and that's more
her thing.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
(groans)
I get it, fine.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.125
I don't always dress like
a...steering wheel cover.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.027
You're lashing out.
I understand.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.763
Doesn't mean I can't turn it on
when I need to.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.897
It's not just that.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.966
I guess...
I don't really feel like

09:25.999 --> 09:28.736
you're comfortable
with my sexuality.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.439
You and Haley can talk
about guys and sex,

09:32.472 --> 09:34.942
but you still see me
as a 12-year-old.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.745
Honey, I'm sorry.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.613
I'm so sorry if I gave you
that impression,

09:39.647 --> 09:42.082
but to be fair,
you don't really share

09:42.115 --> 09:43.917
that part of your life
with me.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.954
I guess that's valid.
(chuckles)

09:46.987 --> 09:49.256
So, are you gonna give me
a shot?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.791
Let me tart you up
for Bill.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.927
Okay.
But it is not just for Bill

09:53.961 --> 09:55.663
because it's also for me
because I'm --

09:55.696 --> 09:57.564
I'm reclaiming
a part of myself

09:57.597 --> 09:58.632
that I don't think
I've really --

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
There's a lot of this.
Yeah. Okay.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.071
This is nuts. First he gets
divorced, and now this?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.305
Hmm,
they may be related.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.539
Is he still here?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.576
Oh, man.
I've been made!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.178
What's he doing?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.445
Uh, he's right
behind you.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.181
Dunphy?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.582
Hey, Gil.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.684
Oh, I was just making
a pitstop

10:16.717 --> 10:18.485
on the way
to the Bunny Ranch.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.120
I accidentally walked
in here

10:20.153 --> 10:22.622
'cause some local said
they had great wings.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.692
Didn't realize
there were no breasts!

10:24.725 --> 10:25.693
(laughter)

10:25.726 --> 10:27.627
Am I right?!
Oh, hey.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.097
You don't have to do this.
I'm -- I'm Mitch,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
I'm Phil's brother-in-law,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.433
and it's okay
that you're gay.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.803
Whoa! What?
Hold on a second now.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.337
That's crazy!

10:37.370 --> 10:38.438
You're gay!

10:38.471 --> 10:39.439
Yes, I know.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.974
It's not the insult
you think it is.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.943
Charming as ever.
Off you go. Best of luck.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.511
I got this, okay?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.046
It's gonna take him
some time to --

10:46.079 --> 10:47.280
to accept
who he really is.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.315
I'm totally gay.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.683
Wow, you're off
to a strong start.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.884
It's just --
it's strange

10:50.918 --> 10:52.720
to say it out loud like that,
you know?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.954
I'm a gay man.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.888
(chuckles)

10:54.922 --> 10:56.323
I'm a big gay man.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.490
(chuckles)

10:57.524 --> 10:59.359
Feels like a big gay weight
has been lifted off me.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.294
Just a weight.
Yeah.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.329
But doesn't it feel great
to --

11:02.362 --> 11:03.864
to finally own
who you really are?

11:03.897 --> 11:04.865
Yeah, it does.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.999
I remember admitting
to my dad

11:06.033 --> 11:07.034
I was into magic.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.469
It's not the same,
Dunphy.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.171
(chuckles)
It's just not --

11:11.204 --> 11:13.073
God, I have so many questions
for you, though.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.343
(chuckles)
Hey, hey, first time I walked
into this bar, I did, too.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.344
Fire away.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.879
Okay.
(stammering)

11:18.912 --> 11:20.413
I'm just not comfortable
opening up

11:20.447 --> 11:21.849
in front of the breeder here,
okay?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.516
You have more kids
than I do!

11:23.550 --> 11:24.885
That's homophobic, man!

11:24.918 --> 11:27.020
Hey, Phil, why don't -- why
don't you grab us some drinks?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.289
Okay. Fine.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.558
Yeah.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.695
Whoa. (chuckles)
Wow, hi.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.664
It's my lucky day.
Thank you for that.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.999
But I'm afraid I'm taken.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.033
That's too bad.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.069
Why is it so hard for me
to meet someone?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.537
I, um...

11:44.571 --> 11:47.040
I have the perfect guy
for you.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.942
He has got a great sense
of humor, big heart.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.878
I have a thing
for red heads.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.113
He's with me.
Uh, the other one.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.347
Him? Pass.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.383
He's been lurking
around here for weeks.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.752
Like I'm impressed he's
"Southern California's
number one Realtor."

11:58.786 --> 12:00.353
No, he's not!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.055
Well,
what are you afraid of?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.423
(sighs)
I don't know, Mitchell.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.925
I'm so late to the game.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.193
Who's even gonna
want me?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.727
Mitchell, um,
it's getting late,

12:07.761 --> 12:09.729
and we don't want
to keep Mr. Lucas waiting.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.364
Whoa. You're leaving?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.532
But...

12:12.565 --> 12:13.934
(stammering)

12:13.967 --> 12:15.102
You're the first person
I ever talked to

12:15.135 --> 12:16.436
about any of this stuff.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.940
(sighs)
Uh, one -- one second.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.909
Phil.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.076
I can't leave him
this way.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.744
What?!
He's a monster!

12:24.778 --> 12:25.779
And not one of the cool ones

12:25.813 --> 12:27.580
created by
Industrial Light and Magic!

12:27.614 --> 12:29.482
I know. This --
This is a lot to take in,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.885
but I think that there's
a really good guy in there

12:31.919 --> 12:33.887
and -- and he needs me.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.223
I'm sorry,
you go, have fun.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.258
You're --
You're picking him over me?!

12:38.291 --> 12:39.827
No. I just need to make sure
he's okay.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.761
Look, I-I'll try and get there
if I can.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.063
Do, or do not.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.264
There is no try.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.333
Please don't Yoda me.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.337
Twenty years ago,
I was in this bar,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.504
feeling just like you do.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.141
And this really nice guy came up
to talk to me.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.277
I-I think he could see
how lost and alone I was.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.079
And, I don't know,

12:59.112 --> 13:01.014
it felt like my whole world
opened up that day.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.984
(chuckles)
Wow,
that's a touching story.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.854
So when are we gonna start
touching?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.255
I'm sorry, what?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.423
I say we head out
to the parking lot,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.625
get a little crazy
in my ex-wife's minivan, huh?

13:12.659 --> 13:14.461
No! No, gross!

13:14.494 --> 13:16.196
Fine, Prince Harry.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.630
I'll pop
for a hotel room.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.166
But that means
we're doing everything.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.600
Okay.
Y-You're awful!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.169
Well, at least
I'm not a tease.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.803
What a waste
of an afternoon.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.006
Hey, I'm Gil.
Just came out.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.674
Feeling kind of lost
and alone.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.775
You, run.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.677
C-C-Can someone give me
a ride?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.612
I need to go after the guy
I was here with.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.314
Let's go.
He's worth it.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.282
Ooh, a hat.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.217
Fun.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.852
ALEX: I don't know
about this.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.388
Come on, honey,
I picked it out.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.956
I'm not gonna judge you.
I swear.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.792
(gasps)
You look beautiful.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.194
I love it.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.529
Really?
It's not too much?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.499
Let the prudes leave something
to the imagination.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.903
Bill's gonna be all, "Let me get
a piece of that," huh?

13:55.936 --> 13:56.904
(laughs)

13:56.937 --> 13:58.705
Uch.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.875
How about lingerie?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.210
Mm.

14:03.243 --> 14:07.314
Yes, um, I would love your input
on my lingerie.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.382
What would Bill like?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.151
Oh, something with snaps.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.652
He doesn't like
complicated garments.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.221
He's easily frustrated.
(chuckles)

14:14.254 --> 14:17.324
That is so fun to know.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.658
Um, can I just say,

14:18.691 --> 14:23.363
I am so comfortable
with your sexuality.

14:23.396 --> 14:29.036
Canjust say that your comfort
with my sexuality

14:29.069 --> 14:33.373
has made me more comfortable
with my sexuality.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.009
Can I just say that if I had
my gun in my purse,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.911
I would shoot myself.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.382
(vocalizing
"The Imperial March" sadly)

14:45.986 --> 14:47.187
(vehicle approaching)

14:47.220 --> 14:48.922
MITCHELL: Phil!

14:48.956 --> 14:50.290
Phil!

14:51.491 --> 14:53.360
What are you doing?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.928
I am so sorry!

14:54.962 --> 14:56.763
Well, you should be!

14:56.796 --> 14:57.931
Phil!

14:57.965 --> 15:01.034
Hear him out,
he feels terrible!

15:01.068 --> 15:03.370
You were right about Gil!
He's awful!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.772
He has
no redeeming qualities,

15:05.805 --> 15:07.774
well, except for his taste
in men! (chuckles)

15:07.807 --> 15:10.310
You know how important
this was to me?!

15:10.343 --> 15:11.544
Of course!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.546
I-I'm as big a Star Wars fan
as you are!

15:13.580 --> 15:15.882
It was never about
Star Wars!

15:15.915 --> 15:18.651
It was about spending time
with you!

15:18.685 --> 15:20.287
Oh, really?!

15:20.320 --> 15:21.955
Yes!

15:21.989 --> 15:24.291
Well, I love spending time
with you!

15:24.324 --> 15:26.293
You do?!

15:26.326 --> 15:27.794
Totally!

15:27.827 --> 15:29.629
You're like the brother
I never had!

15:29.662 --> 15:31.731
What?!
That's crazy cakes!

15:31.764 --> 15:34.267
I say that about you
all the time!
Stop it!

15:34.301 --> 15:36.803
I had a totally different idea
about what this was,

15:36.836 --> 15:38.505
but it's still beautiful!

15:38.538 --> 15:40.440
Eyes on the road!
Eyes on the road!

15:42.709 --> 15:44.477
Hey, what's going on?

15:44.511 --> 15:45.845
Today's been a lot.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.480
Ugh. Same.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.815
You know,
I don't say it enough,

15:48.848 --> 15:52.152
but I am so glad that you and I
can talk about anything.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.453
Something happen
with Alex?

15:53.486 --> 15:54.654
I don't want
to talk about it.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.755
(sighs)

15:55.788 --> 15:57.524
What brings you
to the floor?

15:57.557 --> 16:00.593
Well...

16:00.627 --> 16:04.297
it seems I've gone
and gotten myself...

16:04.331 --> 16:06.366
...promoted.
(chuckles)

16:06.399 --> 16:08.868
Haley, that's fantastic!

16:08.901 --> 16:10.137
(chuckles) Yeah.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.506
Yeah, I, uh -- I get my own
parking spot and an "IRA."

16:13.540 --> 16:15.308
I guess that's my
assistant's name or something?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.510
Sweetheart,
I'm very proud of you.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.479
You really pulled it
together.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.649
Yeah, well, I still have
a lot of stuff to figure out.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.716
Of course you do.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.485
Everyone does
at your age.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.020
Boy, I know I did.
(chuckles)

16:27.054 --> 16:30.223
Did you ever regret having me
when you did?

16:30.257 --> 16:32.359
Like how it kinda
derailed your career?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.826
Hmm... (sighs)

16:33.860 --> 16:36.563
I didn't love it
at first.

16:36.596 --> 16:40.033
But then I saw
this face.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.534
Mm.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.969
And you were lucky enough
to have Dad.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.704
He was born
to be a parent.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.040
This is gonna come
as a surprise to you,

16:47.074 --> 16:49.709
but your dad was a different guy
than you think.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.978
What?! Who?!
Is that why I'm so short?!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.213
No! Haley!

16:53.246 --> 16:54.214
Oh.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.848
When I met your father,

16:55.882 --> 16:57.517
he did not have
his life together.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.219
(breathes deeply)
But to his credit,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.054
he really stepped up
when I got pregnant,

17:01.088 --> 17:02.422
and I think that's what
made it work.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.591
You know,
having someone to depend on.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.725
Hmm.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.094
How did I get down
this road?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.428
(laughing) I don't know!

17:08.461 --> 17:09.662
(chuckles)
Beats me.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.731
Bye!

17:11.764 --> 17:14.167
Okay.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.003
Why is Alex leaving the house
dressed like a flasher?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.905
She and I agreed
not to discuss it.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.441
Her sexual awakening
has been tough on all of us.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.610
Yes.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.712
ANNOUNCER: Second and 6
for the Dolphins.

17:25.745 --> 17:30.550
Thompson, I see you,
I hear you, and I'm listening!

17:30.583 --> 17:32.885
I would have preferred
you stuck to the play we called,

17:32.919 --> 17:35.122
but I respect
your independent spirit!

17:35.155 --> 17:37.357
(grunts)

17:37.390 --> 17:40.527
Okay, Pitkowski, treat the area
around the quarterback

17:40.560 --> 17:41.861
as a "safe space,"

17:41.894 --> 17:43.796
and think
of the other team's defenders

17:43.830 --> 17:47.700
as destructive thoughts trying
to attack our self-esteem!

17:47.734 --> 17:48.935
It's not working.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.238
I hate losing to a team
with a Viking mascot.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.439
Hey!

17:52.472 --> 17:54.541
You died out
and became Swedes!

17:54.574 --> 17:58.445
Hip-hip-hooray for socialism
and seasonal depression!

17:58.478 --> 18:00.079
Our championship
is on the line.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.248
You gotta do something.

18:04.151 --> 18:08.655
Men, this is the biggest moment
of your life

18:08.688 --> 18:11.624
and I don't know
how to fire you up!

18:11.658 --> 18:13.993
My original plan was
to come in here,

18:14.026 --> 18:15.795
single out
the under-performers

18:15.828 --> 18:18.064
and throw diapers at them!

18:18.097 --> 18:21.468
Now I realize that could be
interpreted as insensitive

18:21.501 --> 18:23.603
or, perhaps, anti-baby!

18:23.636 --> 18:25.405
I'm sorry,

18:25.438 --> 18:30.777
but the football field
was always my safe space, okay?!

18:30.810 --> 18:32.312
It's where, in high school,

18:32.345 --> 18:35.915
I first gained the respect
of my peers,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.484
and if I'm being honest,

18:37.517 --> 18:38.518
where I'd hoped
I'd finally gain

18:38.551 --> 18:41.087
the admiration
of my father-in-law.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.123
Now I feel like I've just...

18:44.157 --> 18:45.892
(voice breaking)
let you all down.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.163
You want to know
how I feel?

18:50.197 --> 18:53.032
Hurt that Coach Tucker
doesn't know

18:53.065 --> 18:54.534
how much
we appreciate him.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.337
Triggered because
he's got to apologize

18:57.370 --> 18:58.538
for a few words

18:58.571 --> 18:59.972
after all he's done

19:00.006 --> 19:02.709
to prove himself
as a man and a coach.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.345
I've admired you
for a long time

19:05.378 --> 19:07.680
and if I haven't let you
know that, that's on me --

19:07.714 --> 19:09.682
and I'm "cissy-gendered"
enough to admit it.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.551
And from now on,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.453
I'm gonna make sure
that Coach Tucker knows

19:13.486 --> 19:17.424
he's a person of value
I admire and respect.

19:19.226 --> 19:23.196
Coach Tucker's a person of value
I admire and respect!

19:23.230 --> 19:26.299
Coach Tucker's a person of value
I admire and respect!

19:26.333 --> 19:29.969
ALL: Coach Tucker's a person
of value I admire and respect!

19:30.002 --> 19:33.506
Coach Tucker's a person of value
I admire and respect!

19:33.540 --> 19:35.575
Now let's go take it
to these guys,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.544
who I'm sure are blessed with
other gifts

19:37.577 --> 19:38.878
but are not great
at football!

19:38.911 --> 19:40.046
Let's go!

19:40.079 --> 19:43.015
(indistinct shouting
and cheering)

19:45.051 --> 19:47.320
Can you believe
they bought it?

19:47.354 --> 19:50.022
Bought what?

19:50.056 --> 19:53.360
PRINCIPAL BROWN:
We live in sensitive times.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.928
DYLAN: Nothing?

19:55.962 --> 19:58.064
No brain at all?
(chuckles)

19:58.097 --> 19:59.499
Well, that's gonna hurt
my career.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.403
So we must evolve
if we want to succeed.

20:03.436 --> 20:07.840
(camera shutter clicking)

20:07.874 --> 20:10.443
Sometimes that requires us to
share our vulnerabilities...

20:10.477 --> 20:11.911
Thanks.

20:11.944 --> 20:16.215
...so that we can see
one another in a new way.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.350
How are you doing?

20:17.384 --> 20:19.952
I think
I'm okay with it.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.454
I'm scared.

20:21.488 --> 20:25.392
But it's less scary knowing
I'm going through it with you.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.230
That concludes today's
non-denominational

20:31.264 --> 20:33.533
inspirational affirmation.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.569
Have the day
that's right for you.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.640
Let's see those little bastards
complain about that.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.008
Oh, no!

20:44.243 --> 20:47.814
That's right, guys, high knees,
high knees.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.582
Commie to your left!

20:49.616 --> 20:51.784
Commie to your right!

20:51.818 --> 20:53.486
Stop dragging,
Pitkowski,

20:53.520 --> 20:54.987
they're coming after
your sweetheart!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.255
You know what they did
to Poland!

20:56.289 --> 20:57.424
Well, I want to stop this,

20:57.457 --> 20:58.558
but there's nothing
in the guidelines

20:58.591 --> 20:59.992
about Communists.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.562
Now, we're high like
a hippie!

21:02.595 --> 21:03.796
We're bending over
like a --

21:03.830 --> 21:05.998
Okay!
Shut it down, Jay!

21:06.032 --> 21:08.668
All right, boys,
hydrate like I taught you.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.304
Attaboy.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.408
There you go.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.443
(boys coughing)

21:19.512 --> 21:22.449
