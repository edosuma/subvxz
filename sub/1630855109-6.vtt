WEBVTT

00:25.942 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:53.762 --> 00:55.680
Whee! Whoo-hoo!

00:55.680 --> 00:57.557
Yeah!

00:57.557 --> 00:59.976
Thanks for showing us
your piloting moves, Nash.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.730
Can't wait to try them during our
flying lessons with Master Zia tomorrow.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.815
You haven't even seen my best move.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.860
I call it the Throttle Buster!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.530
- Whoo-hoo!

01:14.324 --> 01:16.242
Whoo-hoo!

01:18.036 --> 01:19.537
Whoa!
Whoo!

01:22.624 --> 01:24.000
Whoa!

01:28.088 --> 01:31.800
That was great!

01:31.800 --> 01:35.595
Nash, you gotta teach us
the Throttle Buster, please?

01:35.595 --> 01:37.430
It's really hard.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.266
We should wait until
you've had a little more time to train.

01:42.852 --> 01:48.566
But I guess I could let you fly
the <i>Crimson Firehawk</i> for a bit.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.403
Really? I've never flown it before!

01:52.403 --> 01:54.489
Now, be gentle with the <i>Firehawk</i>.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.866
Whoa!

01:59.619 --> 02:01.454
- I said, be gentle!

02:01.454 --> 02:03.498
Sorry!

02:05.667 --> 02:07.418
Watch out!
Sorry!

02:07.418 --> 02:10.088
Slow down! Be careful!
Sorry!

02:19.139 --> 02:22.225
Huh. You're actually
pretty good at flying, Kai.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.645
Thanks! We took some beginner
flying lessons already. Watch this!

02:29.899 --> 02:31.651
Pretty fun, huh?

02:31.651 --> 02:33.444
- Kai, look out!

02:50.461 --> 02:54.465
Sorry for the rough landing, Nash.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.635
Eh, that's okay.
The <i>Firehawk</i> is tougher than it looks.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.888
- Oof!

03:00.722 --> 03:03.099
Come on, RJ.
Let's check for any damage.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.688
Hi, Master Zia.
Sorry about the rough landing.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.231
Nash let me fly the <i>Firehawk</i>.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.484
Believe it or not,
I've seen worse landings.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.945
I hope you're all ready
for your flying lesson tomorrow.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.364
Kai could definitely use another lesson.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.909
- Hey!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.870
- First, you three need some ships to fly.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.956
I'm sending you and Nash
to pick them up from my friend Zepher.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.084
His starship repair shop is
on one of the moons of Tenoo.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.796
Hey! Ha! I know Zepher.
He's a friend of my mom's too!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.050
Oh, gasket-thrusters!

03:37.050 --> 03:39.636
You'll be flying the ships
back here to the Temple.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.723
Kai, I know you want to fly like Nash,
but you're still learning.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.892
So,
please take it easy until you're ready.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.645
Don't worry, Master Zia.
We'll bring those starships back

03:48.645 --> 03:50.271
- without a scratch.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.316
Could use a little help over here!

03:53.316 --> 03:55.318
- Oh, come on!

03:55.318 --> 03:58.488
We'll leave for the mission
right after we help Nash.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.786
- Whoa.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.622
Those are the two moons of Tenoo.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.458
The big one with the rings around it
is where we'll find Zepher.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.089
That looks like a fun place
to fly a starship.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.384
What is that?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.552
I see you've met our space slug.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.554
- Amazing!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.232
Nash Durango!

04:34.232 --> 04:35.483
- Zepher!

04:35.483 --> 04:39.362
By the light!
Look how you've grown.

04:39.362 --> 04:43.199
And good to see you too, RJ.
How's my favorite droid?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.953
Kai, Lys, Nubs, meet Zepher!

04:46.953 --> 04:50.164
He taught my parents everything
they know about starship engines.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.000
Hello, younglings!

04:52.000 --> 04:57.088
Master Zia told me you'd be coming.
You are most welcome here, my friends.

04:57.088 --> 05:00.216
Come, come! Let me show you to your ships.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.761
Whoa!

05:03.761 --> 05:05.138
Jedi Vectors!

05:05.138 --> 05:06.639
They're beautiful.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.809
- I can't wait to fly 'em!

05:09.809 --> 05:12.812
Ha-pa-pup-pup, not so fast, young Jedi.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.357
I've made changes
so these ships can be used by younglings.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.235
Uh, they take a little,
uh, getting used to.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.029
Sounds like fun to me.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.157
I like your attitude.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.493
But before I let you fly
all the way back to the Temple,

05:27.493 --> 05:30.204
you'll need to prove
you can handle them safely.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.497
Like a test flight?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.582
Exactly!

05:32.582 --> 05:37.045
Nash, you're the best pilot I know.
Can you lead these three on a test flight?

05:37.045 --> 05:39.797
- Does a wipplebog snort when it's sleepy?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.719
Y-Yes. The answer is yes.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.597
- This is gonna be a blast.

06:00.943 --> 06:01.944
<i>Okay.</i>

06:01.944 --> 06:04.197
So, we're gonna do some fancy flyin'.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.531
- Follow me.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.908
<i>Do try to keep up</i>.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.619
Whoo-hoo!

06:11.871 --> 06:13.331
Whoo-hoo!

06:30.139 --> 06:33.142
Ooh! A flock of Karnis birds.
I've never seen them in person--

06:33.142 --> 06:34.602
<i>Lys!</i>

06:35.269 --> 06:36.312
<i>Pay attention.</i>

06:36.312 --> 06:38.648
Oh! [chuckles] Oops! Thanks, Nash.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.279
Nice, Kai! You really are good at flying.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.614
Thanks, Nash.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.741
<i>All right, everyone's looking good.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:51.160
-<i>For the next part of the test flight...</i>
Whoa.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.162
<i>...we're gonna do something a little harder.</i>

06:53.162 --> 06:54.914
A little harder, huh?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.958
<i>To get the best angle on this...</i>
Ooh!

06:56.958 --> 07:00.294
Those asteroids look
like the perfect place to practice.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.046
This is gonna be fun.

07:02.713 --> 07:06.801
Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

07:06.801 --> 07:09.429
Ha! Ha!

07:09.429 --> 07:13.057
This is harder, but this is a blast.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.688
<i>Kai, there you are!
We didn't realize you had left. You okay?</i>

07:18.688 --> 07:20.022
Sorry 'bout that!

07:20.523 --> 07:24.026
I just got so excited
about flying around these asteroids.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.988
You gotta try it. It's amazing!

07:26.988 --> 07:29.490
It does look like a fun place
to test your skills.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.159
- All right.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.286
If we stay together, we should be fine.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.370
Let's go.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.667
Now, this is a test flight.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.922
Wow! You three are getting
really good with those Vectors.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.591
Time to take things up a notch.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.552
That asteroid looks like a good place
for a Throttle Buster.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.928
I'm not so sure you should--

07:52.555 --> 07:53.973
Oh, there he goes.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.060
I'm doing it!

08:00.021 --> 08:01.564
Whoa!

08:01.564 --> 08:03.024
- Uh-oh.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.193
Whoa!

08:05.818 --> 08:07.612
Whoa!

08:07.612 --> 08:09.489
I didn't do it.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.284
I pulled the throttle too soon,
and I damaged my ship, didn't I?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.954
<i>So close. Uh, that's okay, Kai.</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:19.457
It's just a couple scratches.
Zepher can fix--

08:19.457 --> 08:20.917
Uh-oh!

08:23.878 --> 08:26.297
What? [gasps] It's--

08:26.297 --> 08:27.465
The space slug!

08:27.465 --> 08:29.300
- Hurry! Fly away!

08:31.093 --> 08:34.138
Let's go, let's go!
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

08:36.098 --> 08:40.144
Lys, Nubs, Nash, RJ-83, you okay?

08:40.144 --> 08:42.855
<i>Kai! We're inside the slug!</i>

08:42.855 --> 08:44.565
It's-- It's--

08:46.442 --> 08:48.361
It's incredible!

08:49.820 --> 08:51.989
- We're fine.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.366
And the ships are safe.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.910
There must be a way
to get you out of there!

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
I'm so sorry.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.207
I-- I guess I wasn't ready
to do the Throttle Buster.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.751
Throttle...

09:03.751 --> 09:07.672
I have an idea, but you're going to have
to listen to me and follow my directions.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.925
Okay, Nash, I'm listening.
What's the plan?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.183
Okay, Kai. Nash's plan's gonna be great.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.687
Just gotta do the Throttle Buster
to make sure the giant slug chases you

09:22.687 --> 09:24.814
and open its mouth
so your friends can escape,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.316
but also make sure
you don't get swallowed. Easy.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.612
<i>Kai, I believe in you.</i>

09:31.612 --> 09:35.157
We've practiced flying all day.
You're ready to do this.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.076
I hope.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.746
We're gonna blast out as soon as
you make the slug open its mouth.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.334
The Force is with me.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.421
Okay, here we go!

09:49.505 --> 09:52.258
Hey, Sluggie! Over here!

10:00.057 --> 10:01.934
It's open! Get out of there!

10:01.934 --> 10:03.519
<i>Now! Now! Now!</i>

10:09.358 --> 10:10.401
Come on, Kai!

10:10.401 --> 10:12.069
He's following my directions!

10:12.069 --> 10:14.238
He's doing the Throttle Buster
the right way!

10:14.238 --> 10:16.073
Wait for it!

10:16.073 --> 10:17.491
All right, let's do this!

10:20.911 --> 10:23.164
Its mouth is closing! Hurry!

10:25.041 --> 10:27.460
We can make it! We can make it!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.086
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

10:29.086 --> 10:31.047
Whoa!

10:31.547 --> 10:32.882
We did it!

10:36.802 --> 10:39.221
- Yes!
<i>That was amazing!</i>

10:39.221 --> 10:40.723
<i>I knew you were ready</i>!

10:40.723 --> 10:43.684
Now, let's get your ship fixed up
before we head for the Temple.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.400
Sorry about the ship, Zepher.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.612
I should have listened to Nash
and followed her directions.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.198
Psh! These are training ships.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.035
Of course they're gonna
get banged up from time to time.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.829
And I'm always happy to help fix 'em up.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.040
From what Nash told me,

11:06.040 --> 11:09.126
it sounds like you three
are ready to take these to the Temple.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.212
You really think so, Nash?

11:11.212 --> 11:14.298
Flying isn't easy, but you've learned
a valuable lesson today.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.842
Besides,
after escaping a giant space slug,

11:16.842 --> 11:19.261
- flying home should be a piece of cake.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.262
- Yeah!
- Yes!

11:20.262 --> 11:21.681
Now, fly safe.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.517
And if you ever need someone
to fix up your ships,

11:24.517 --> 11:25.810
you know where to find me.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.353
Thanks, Zepher.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.571
Wow! Zepher did a great job on the ships!

11:37.571 --> 11:39.323
He always does.

11:39.323 --> 11:43.244
And you've definitely got
three great pilots here, Master Zia.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.579
They're ready
for their next lesson tomorrow.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.415
We learned from the best.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.291
I'm glad to hear it, Nash.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.962
Now, who wants to go on one more
practice flight before tomorrow's lesson?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.505
Yes!

11:54.505 --> 11:57.299
Now, who wants to try the Throttle Buster?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.468
Not me!

12:03.055 --> 12:05.474
You're gonna pay
for that one, Nubs.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.727
- Come on, almost there!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.353
- And that's how you do it.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.272
- Good race, Nubs.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.606
Great timing!

12:12.606 --> 12:14.942
Nash says we're going to be
at planet Federian soon.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.653
I can't wait to see
the beautiful Federian trees there.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.533
Nubs is right!

12:22.533 --> 12:26.036
These special trees have wood that's
some of the strongest in the galaxy.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.248
I can't wait to see them in person
and the forest wildlife.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.293
- It's a pretty special forest.

12:32.293 --> 12:36.839
Master Zia sent us here to learn about it,
but you and Nubs already know so much.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.424
What more could we possibly learn?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.343
You always learn new things
when you visit new places.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.428
<i>Nash here!</i>

12:42.428 --> 12:45.973
We're about to arrive at the forest,
but there's a bit of a problem.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.769
Wait, where are the trees?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.937
I thought we were supposed to land
in the forest.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.484
According to my directions,
this should be the forest.

13:01.489 --> 13:05.159
Sawdust!
That must mean these trees were cut down.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.078
Who would do that
to this beautiful forest?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.543
Oh, hello there. I know what you are.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.046
- You're a skriffle!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.715
They're friendly
and smart little critters!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.427
What's wrong, little one?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.889
Something bad happened here, didn't it?

13:29.433 --> 13:31.393
- I think he wants us to follow him!

13:31.393 --> 13:33.145
- RJ, can you keep an eye

13:33.145 --> 13:35.856
on the <i>Firehawk</i>
while we find out what happened?

13:35.856 --> 13:37.525
- Thanks, buddy.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.904
- He's fast for a little guy.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.617
Aw, he's gone.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.204
- Oh, and he's back!

13:50.204 --> 13:53.958
He must want to show us something
on the other side. Come on!

13:53.958 --> 13:56.001
Ow!

13:59.588 --> 14:01.799
Whoa!

14:08.347 --> 14:09.765
Whoa.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.017
That must be
the tallest tree in the forest.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.185
Whoa!
Wow!

14:24.905 --> 14:27.825
Look at all the skriffles!
They're so cute!

14:27.825 --> 14:30.077
They are, but they look so sad.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.832
Skriffles normally live in trees
all over the Federian forest.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.420
You must have all been scared
when the other trees were cut down

14:39.420 --> 14:41.839
and came here
to the tallest one for protection!

14:46.385 --> 14:49.388
So these trees are the skriffles' homes!

14:51.974 --> 14:54.810
I promise we're gonna find out
who cut down those trees

14:54.810 --> 14:56.979
and make sure
they don't cut down any more.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
We're going to protect your homes.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.024
Let's get going.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.943
We need to figure out who or what
cut down these trees.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.195
Coming along, huh?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.781
Okay, what do we see?

15:07.781 --> 15:10.326
- Vehicle tracks!

15:10.326 --> 15:11.911
Huh, good eye, Nubs.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.788
These might've come from
whatever machine cut down those trees.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.874
- And look, they lead this way.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.878
We've been following
these tracks forever.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.850
- Hmm?
- What is that thing?

15:37.394 --> 15:39.521
- It's okay, little buddy.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.234
Hmm.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.573
Sawdust. This is what cut down the trees!

15:49.573 --> 15:52.117
Let's talk to whoever's driving it
and tell them to stop.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.123
Hello, is anyone in there?

15:58.123 --> 16:00.042
Ahem, state your business.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.795
Oh! Um. My-my-my business?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.297
We need to talk to whoever's in charge
of this vehicle.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.841
Yeah! They shouldn't be
cutting down these trees!

16:08.926 --> 16:11.011
Raxlo has no time for you.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.013
Uh, who's Raxlo?

16:13.013 --> 16:16.016
Raxlo is in charge of this vehicle.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.060
So, it's not you?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.312
I am RC-99.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.774
Raxlo is very busy.
He cannot see visitors.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.819
Thank you for contacting
the Raxlo Corporation. Ta-ta.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.157
We have to get inside
to talk to this Raxlo person.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.994
Oh, we will, and I know who can help us.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.747
State your business.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.793
- Oh, state your business.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.968
Fascinating!
And what happened next? I must know!

16:52.553 --> 16:54.138
He tells the best stories.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.639
Now's our chance!

16:55.639 --> 16:57.057
- You don't say.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.143
- And then what happened?

17:10.612 --> 17:11.947
Uh-oh.

17:11.947 --> 17:14.324
How did you get inside?

17:14.324 --> 17:15.826
- Uh.

17:15.826 --> 17:16.952
There!

17:16.952 --> 17:18.412
You need to leave now!

17:19.496 --> 17:20.998
Ha!

17:22.166 --> 17:23.292
- Hurry!

17:24.585 --> 17:27.296
Raxlo doesn't care
for unscheduled visitors!

17:28.547 --> 17:30.049
Phew!

17:30.049 --> 17:33.218
Well, that was fun,
but we still need to find Raxlo.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.972
Ah, so you're looking for me.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.602
Sorry for barging in, but we need to talk.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.687
I don't have time for visitors.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.648
Too many things to do.
It's a busy, busy day.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.526
Then we'll make it quick.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.653
- Did your machine--
- My harvester.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.740
Did your harvester
cut down the Federian trees?

17:54.740 --> 17:59.536
Well, yes. I would hope so.
That is after all what I built it to do.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.500
I have no idea what he's saying.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.588
There's some kind of furry rodent on you.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.133
This is a skriffle,
and the Federian trees are their homes.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.053
If you keep cutting them down,
they'll have no place to live.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.764
Aw, how terribly unfortunate.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.141
So you need to stop
cutting down those trees!

18:21.141 --> 18:22.226
I see.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.980
There's another thing you may not know
about these very special trees.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.607
Come with me.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.443
Ah, Raxlo, apologies.

18:31.443 --> 18:35.447
Everything's fine, RC-99.
I'm handling this.

18:37.616 --> 18:42.204
You may know that Federian trees
have amazingly strong wood

18:42.204 --> 18:44.540
that makes amazingly strong buildings.

18:44.540 --> 18:50.170
But what you may not know
is that the trees are very valuable.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.841
It's why I'm gonna cut 'em all down
and sell 'em for lots and lots of money.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.635
But my harvester overheated

18:56.635 --> 19:00.931
before I cut down the largest,
most valuable Federian tree.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.434
And now that you know
these trees are homes to creatures,

19:04.434 --> 19:05.644
you'll stop, right?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.855
Oh. No.

19:07.855 --> 19:12.526
The thing is, my harvester is now
cooled down and ready to cut, cut, cut.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.655
And since I'd prefer not having
any Jedi trying to stop me...

19:19.741 --> 19:22.411
I'm afraid I'll have to drop you off here
until I'm done.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.579
Ta!

19:36.633 --> 19:41.054
Raxlo's gonna cut down the trees,
the rest of the skriffles' homes!

19:42.931 --> 19:46.810
But what can we do?
We're kinda tied up if you hadn't noticed.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.904
You called your friends!

20:01.992 --> 20:03.035
Thank you.

20:03.035 --> 20:07.164
Lys, we can stop Raxlo,
but we need to get ahead of him!

20:07.164 --> 20:08.415
To the <i>Firehawk</i>!

20:18.300 --> 20:19.343
Okay, everyone,

20:19.343 --> 20:22.512
we have a little time before Raxlo
and his harvester get here.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.140
If we're gonna stop him, we need a plan.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.976
Nubs,
I'm gonna need you to find a boulder.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.073
- You okay, Nubs?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.157
Okay.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.457
Them again.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.084
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Please slow down.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.627
You little--

20:54.711 --> 20:56.588
Thought I'd gotten rid of you kids!

20:56.588 --> 20:59.508
- Turn around and leave this forest alone.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.593
This is your last chance, Raxlo!

21:01.593 --> 21:03.929
Hmm. Let me think.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.597
Uh... No.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.228
I thought he might say that.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.896
Nubs, now!

21:25.033 --> 21:28.120
They think that'll stop my harvester?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.043
- Lys!

21:38.130 --> 21:39.131
Whoo-hoo!

21:42.926 --> 21:45.053
All right!

21:47.639 --> 21:50.600
- What the--
Pull!

21:58.066 --> 21:59.401
I don't think so!

22:09.995 --> 22:10.996
Huh?

22:16.543 --> 22:17.961
Almost there!

22:23.383 --> 22:25.385
Yay!
Whoo-hoo!

22:25.385 --> 22:27.346
No! No!

22:27.346 --> 22:30.682
My harvester!
You've broken my beautiful harvester!

22:30.682 --> 22:32.976
It's time you leave, Raxlo.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.936
Oh, I won't ever come back!

22:34.936 --> 22:38.648
Your little rodent friends
can keep their trees!

22:38.648 --> 22:40.901
Come on, RC-99! We're outta here.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.823
- Yeah!

22:46.823 --> 22:47.908
- We did it!
- Yes!

22:47.908 --> 22:48.992
Oh, yeah, we did!

22:48.992 --> 22:51.578
And I learned
so much more than I thought I would.

22:51.578 --> 22:54.164
I learned that a forest is
more than just trees.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.501
To creatures and animals that live in it,
the forest is home.

22:57.501 --> 23:02.130
<i>I am so proud of you for protecting
the forest and the skriffles' homes,</i>

23:02.130 --> 23:05.217
<i>and we'll make sure we help
replant the trees that were cut down.</i>

23:05.217 --> 23:06.718
Thank you, Master Zia.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.304
Did you hear that?
We're gonna help fix your home,

23:09.304 --> 23:11.807
and from now on,
you'll live in peace and happiness.
