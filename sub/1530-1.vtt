WEBVTT

00:08.675 --> 00:10.177
The secret is out.

00:11.512 --> 00:16.564
For decades, your organization stayed
in the shadows, hiding the truth.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.691
But now we know. They're among us.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.488
Heroes.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.779
And monsters.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.989
The world is full of wonders.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.955
- Thanks, Bernie.
-You bet.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.454
Ace, come and get it.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.166
What do you say we go out to your
Aunt Mindy's this weekend?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.042
You and Keisha can swim in the pond.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.126
Sure.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.639
You know, you got a birthday
coming up in a couple of months.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.803
Who's your favorite?

00:49.466 --> 00:50.467
I'm okay.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.522
Hey.

00:56.098 --> 00:59.147
Things are tight right now,
but I'm gonna find something.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.230
Not back at the factory,
but I got prospects.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.907
- You and me, what are we?
-We're a team.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.984
That's right. So, who do you...

01:14.741 --> 01:17.711
Are you okay? All right, Ace, look at me.
I need you to stay here with Bernie.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.834
Okay, people might be hurt,
and I'm gonna see if they need my help.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.587
Stay with Bernie. Watch my boy!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.935
Help me! Help me!

02:02.914 --> 02:04.837
Help me! Help me!

02:39.076 --> 02:41.420
We can't explain
everything we see,

02:41.495 --> 02:43.168
but our eyes are open.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.457
So what now?

02:46.083 --> 02:48.256
There are no more shadows
for you to hide in.

02:49.795 --> 02:53.925
Something impossible just happened.
What are you going to do about it?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.853
Agent Ward,
there's been a development.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.358
It's the Rising Tide.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.532
They've pinned down the location of
the package. We need to abort.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.450
I'm five minutes away from retrieving it.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.201
So is everyone else.
They posted the coordinates online.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.326
If the job was easy...

03:17.447 --> 03:21.327
Yeah, it wouldn't be any fun.
Watch your 6.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.966
Red tie, by the window.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.560
Your fireplace is broken.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.078
Ward, just a heads up.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.334
We've got possible hostiles
in your vicinity.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.286
Really?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.286
What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for,
Agent Ward?

05:23.907 --> 05:28.708
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.623
And what does that mean to you?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.134
It means someone really wanted
our initials to spell out "shield."

05:37.963 --> 05:40.807
it means we're the line
between the world

05:41.800 --> 05:43.268
and the much weirder world.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.063
We protect people from news
they aren't ready to hear.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.766
And when we can't do that,
we keep them safe.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.903
Something turns up,

05:54.604 --> 05:57.073
like this Chitauri neural link,

05:59.317 --> 06:01.160
we get to it before someone bad does.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.202
Any idea who Vanchat
was planning to sell it to?

06:05.282 --> 06:08.627
I'm more interested in how this
Rising Tide group found out about it.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.001
I thought they were just hackers.
What changed?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.419
Everything's changing.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.509
A little while ago, most people
went to bed thinking

06:16.626 --> 06:20.426
that the craziest thing in the world was
a billionaire in a flying metal suit.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.263
Then aliens invaded New York and
were beaten back by, among others,

06:24.342 --> 06:28.643
a giant green monster,
a costumed hero from the '40s,

06:29.139 --> 06:30.265
and a god.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.476
I don't think Thor is technically a god.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.603
Well, you haven't been near his arms.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.825
The Battle of New York
was the end of the world.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.987
This, now, is the new world.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.988
People are different.

06:45.113 --> 06:49.118
They have access to tech, to formulas,
secrets they're not ready for.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.829
Why was I pulled out of Paris?

06:52.370 --> 06:55.169
That you'll have to ask Agent Coulson.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.798
Yeah. I'm clearance Level 6.

06:59.169 --> 07:03.675
I know that Agent Coulson was killed
in action before the Battle of New York.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.307
Got the full report.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.849
Welcome to Level 7.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.025
Sorry, that corner was really dark
and I couldn't help myself.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.153
I think there's a bulb out.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.251
Director Fury faked your death,
to motivate the Avengers.

07:39.376 --> 07:43.051
Well, the death of a common ally is
a particularly effective team builder.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.889
Say "cheese."

07:45.006 --> 07:46.007
Plus, it wasn't that much of a stretch.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.809
I stopped breathing
for about 40 seconds.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.012
Eight.
it gets longer every time you tell it.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.393
Yeah, well, you get shanked by
the Asgardian Mussolini,

07:52.514 --> 07:53.561
you can tell it your way.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.899
I was looking at the big white light,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.189
And it felt like a lot longer
than eight seconds.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.737
Do they know'? The Avengers?
That Fury played them?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.527
They're not Level 7.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.611
Got out of the ICU, Fury stuck me
in a grass shack in Tahiti.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.955
Rough gig. Mai Tais,
Travis McGee novels,

08:09.072 --> 08:12.292
and a physical therapist whose
command of English was irrelevant.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.120
But something
put you back in the game.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.292
What is that?

08:17.914 --> 08:19.632
That's a superhero, Agent Ward.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.798
An unregistered Gifted.
Identity unknown.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.423
The secret's out.
For decades, your organization.-.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.722
Another little present
from the Rising Tide.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.145
How are they getting this
stuff before us?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.059
Same way they cracked our
RSA implementation.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.687
They're good.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.143
So I need better.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.942
Agent Coulson has requisitioned
a mobile command unit,

08:41.062 --> 08:42.359
to which you are assigned.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.192
Rising Tide is trying to draw us out.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.948
I think it's time they succeeded.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.158
You want me to cross them off?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.782
Wow. No.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.497
I wanna use them to get to him.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.494
This man's world is about
to get very weird.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.745
He's gonna need some help.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.793
I'm sorry. I was trained
from day one as a specialist.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.261
I go in alone, I get it done.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.468
Defusing a nuclear bomb, I'm your guy.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.847
A welcoming committee? Not my speed.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.554
I know it's not what you want.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.061
Agent Hill did a very detailed
assessment of your last three missions.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.983
Combat, top grades.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.112
Espionage, she gave you the highest
marks since Romanoff.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.399
Under "people skills," she drew a...

09:25.482 --> 09:29.077
I think it's a little poop
with knives sticking out of it.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.199
- What?
-l'[...

09:30.320 --> 09:31.617
That's bad, right?

09:31.696 --> 09:35.291
And given your family history,
I'm surprised it's not worse.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.170
But I think you're the guy for this.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.334
If I'm wrong,
you go straight back to your bombs.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.508
Team's approved. Physicals are all fine.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.550
Fitz-Simmons is not cleared for combat.
I'm told that won't be an issue.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.473
Agent Ward here, he's almost too fit.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.020
That's an issue.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.855
That should be an issue.
Maybe I can't join the team because...

09:57.972 --> 09:59.974
God, are you dismissed.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.569
It was a porcupine. it was not a poop.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.941
It just means that you need...

10:08.024 --> 10:09.571
No, I'm pretty sure.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.159
And it's not just Ward.
Your whole roster is sketchy.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.831
Well, they're cleared.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.955
I would've been very happy
not to clear you, Phil.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.412
I'd love for you to rest up some more.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.207
I've had plenty of that, thanks.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.717
You sure?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.174
You should go sometime.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.301
Where?

10:30.380 --> 10:33.680
Tahiti. It's a magical place.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.937
Three days in,
I'd be begging for an assignment.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.851
Exactly.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.105
Tahiti.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.946
He really doesn't know, does he?

10:52.569 --> 10:53.786
He can never know.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.589
Is there any way I can thank him?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.879
Are you sure nobody saw him?

11:09.419 --> 11:12.593
So, the identity of the
Hooded Hero still remains unknown.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.514
Researchers at UCLA Medical Center
released a study today, which shows...

11:16.593 --> 11:18.516
- Just act natural.
-What?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.268
Just pretend that we're talking.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.523
- We are.
-Good.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.442
'Cause you never know who's listening.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.444
I don't even know who's talking.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.531
I'm Skye. And you're the Hooded Hero.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.819
Please tell me
that you're not staying with that name.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.405
Wait, what? I'm not...
I'm a factory worker.

11:37.906 --> 11:42.503
Sure, by day. I saw you. You're a hero.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.458
Like, a for real superhero, which is...

11:45.079 --> 11:47.673
I'm not like a groupie-stalker type, but...

11:47.957 --> 11:50.551
Oh, my God! That is so cool!

11:50.627 --> 11:53.631
Okay, okay, chill. Just don't...
Don't draw attention.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.844
You're in danger.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.551
You got the wrong guy, lady.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.352
No, you've got the wrong approach.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.723
The cute girl from the hospital
is dying to thank you,

12:02.805 --> 12:07.402
and possibly "thank" you,
 and you're hiding!

12:07.477 --> 12:09.650
The clip of you rescuing her
has had the most hits

12:09.771 --> 12:13.526
since that puppy with vertigo,
and you can't even find a job.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.823
What do you mean about danger?

12:21.324 --> 12:22.291
S.H.I.E.L.D.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.461
"Shield" what? I should carry a shield?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.412
S.H.I.E.L.D. Government.

12:26.496 --> 12:30.171
Scary men in dark suits
who come after guys like you.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.886
They knew about the Battle of New York
before it even happened.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.589
And then cleaned it up before anyone
could ask any real questions.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.805
Overnight. How long do you think
it'll take for them to clean you up?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.811
And you wanna know why I'm hiding?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.355
What if you didn't hide?

12:44.722 --> 12:48.852
What if you got in front of this
and let people know that you're a hero?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.854
I'm just a guy.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.692
Well, a guy like that gets work,
gets perks.

12:56.526 --> 13:00.952
I can help. I'm great with computers.
Like, weirdly great.

13:01.030 --> 13:05.706
I mean, I could help you create
a whole new identity, or...

13:06.869 --> 13:07.916
A mask!

13:08.037 --> 13:09.129
Okay!

13:10.039 --> 13:12.883
Also, we could just stick with the hood.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.671
Listen. You cannot walk away from this.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.381
With great power comes

13:18.881 --> 13:21.725
a ton of weird crap that you
are not prepared to deal with.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.848
Now, my office is...

13:22.927 --> 13:24.895
You have an office?

13:24.971 --> 13:28.441
Yes, I have an office. It's a mobile office.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.191
It's a van. I live in a van. By choice!

13:32.270 --> 13:34.898
But it's always in the alley
around the corner, free Wi-Fi,

13:35.231 --> 13:36.278
and you can come by any time.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.405
Thank you.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.988
They're coming for you...

13:45.325 --> 13:46.497
...Mike.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.467
Agent May.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.925
No.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.468
So you've been briefed?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.267
I'm not going back in the field.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.937
Yeah, you've got such
a nice set-up here.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.931
You ever thought about adding a moat?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.271
I just need you to drive the bus.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.105
Liaise ground transpo,
some on-site supervision.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.656
This isn't a combat op.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.575
Then you don't need me.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.651
I do.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.530
'Cause we'll be running ourselves.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.996
Picking the ops, making the calls.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.287
No red tape.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.628
This is where they actually make
the red tape, isn't it?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.801
I always wondered.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.961
Melinda.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.471
You're really just asking me
to drive the bus?

14:43.633 --> 14:44.680
I'm not asking.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.642
But it's a really nice bus.

15:12.787 --> 15:16.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch it!
That's the Night-Night Gun!

15:16.457 --> 15:18.255
Well, it's on my stuff
and it doesn't work,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.257
and there's no way we're calling it
the "Night-Night Gun."

15:20.336 --> 15:21.838
The bullets work.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.681
Non-lethal, heavy stopping power,

15:23.798 --> 15:25.516
break up under
the subcutaneous tissue.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.887
Yeah, with a dose of only
0.1 microliters of dendrotoxin.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.389
I'm not Hermione, I can't create
instant paralysis with that.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.650
- You should've run the specs by me...
-The bullets are hollow.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.146
-...before building the molds.
-It's a marvel I can keep them

15:35.226 --> 15:36.227
from breaking apart in the chamber.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.696
Have you ever heard of physics?
Or what's the other one? Inertia?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.242
Fitz-Simmons?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.702
- Fitz.
-Simmons.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.994
I'm Engineering, she's Bio-chem.
Agent Ward?

15:49.699 --> 15:52.248
Coulson said I'd need my comm
receiver encoded.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.380
I don't know if you've worked
with that model before.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.000
It's brand new.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.177
He'll repurpose the I.D.I.S. chip.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.721
Don't need the external receiver for
the inner ear comms anymore.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.093
So, how does it...

16:05.214 --> 16:08.809
Embedded sensory-neural silicone
matched to your DNA. It's very posh.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.981
So, are you excited to be coming on
ourjourney into mystery?

16:13.723 --> 16:14.724
It's like Christmas.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.285
One of Coulson's
old S.H.I.E.L.D. collectibles.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.326
Flame-throwers, world's first GPS.
He's mad for this crap.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.328
Don't touch Lola.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.580
And he calls it a girl's name.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.874
Lola's not just a collectible, you know?

16:38.956 --> 16:42.426
People tend to confuse the words
"new" and "improved."

16:42.502 --> 16:46.598
This mobile command, they were in
heavy rotation back in the '90s,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.345
but then we got a Helicarrier.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.223
Hey, did you hear the one about
the guy who's afraid of flying'?

16:51.302 --> 16:55.557
I've done a nightjump into a drop zone
under heavy fire, sir. I can handle it.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.940
That was a joke. The first part of a...

16:59.936 --> 17:01.404
I'm not gonna tell it now.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.699
If you plan to unpack, make it quick.
Wheels are up in five.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.698
We may have a hit on one of
the Rising Tide's routing points.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.825
Good. We need to do some catching up.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.125
Is that who I think it is?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.498
She's just the pilot.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.463
Melinda May is just the pilot.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.212
Come on, sir.
What game are you really playing?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.260
Better stow your gear.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.357
How will you come at us?
From the air?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.485
From the ground?

17:45.147 --> 17:48.993
How will you silence us this time?
How can you?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.323
The truth is in the wind.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.991
It's everywhere.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.836
You cannot stop the Rising Tide.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.915
You will not find us.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.877
You will never see our faces,
but rest assured,

18:05.001 --> 18:08.380
we will rise against those who shield us
from the truth.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.724
And nothing, nothing,
can stop us in the...

18:15.177 --> 18:17.271
Hey. What up?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.408
You guys are making a big mistake.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.455
You don't look that big.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.917
Sorry for the lack of finesse.

18:38.034 --> 18:42.039
Agent Ward here has had a little history
with your group, the Rising Tide.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.752
I don't know what you...

18:43.873 --> 18:45.841
Okay.
There are two ways we can do this.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.419
Oh. ls one of them the easy way?

18:48.502 --> 18:49.674
No.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.222
Oh.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.886
What's your name?

18:54.383 --> 18:55.475
Skye.

18:55.718 --> 18:56.890
What's your real name?

18:57.261 --> 19:00.731
That can wait. It's another name
we need. A certain hero.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.814
What makes you think I know that?

19:03.893 --> 19:06.066
Well, you made a little mistake.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.815
The phone you filmed
the Hooded Hero with

19:08.898 --> 19:12.573
had the same cryptographic signature
as a few of the Rising Tide posts.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.115
Wow, yeah. Was that a mistake?

19:17.239 --> 19:21.790
Or am I now sitting in the center of your
secret headquarters? What is this?

19:23.079 --> 19:25.958
A plane? I got inside.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.336
And by now you've discovered you can't
beat the encryption on my equipment,

19:29.418 --> 19:30.670
so you got nothing.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.097
We have a fairly strong coincidence.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.143
You being on the scene
right before it went up in flames.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.435
Wanna tell me what my team
is gonna find there?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.572
How did you know
the hooded man was in the building?

19:58.072 --> 19:59.995
Did you blow it up
to draw him out?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.075
Did you?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.455
That's not our style.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.084
I was just kidnapped by your style.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.209
S.H.I.E.L.D. covered up New Mexico,
Project Pegasus.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.508
Of course you'd be
covering up Centipede.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.634
Centipede?

20:16.424 --> 20:17.391
Holy no way.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.178
You don't know what that is.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.556
Billions of dollars of equipment
at your disposal,

20:23.639 --> 20:26.392
and I beat you with a laptop
that I won in a bet?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.603
You need to think about your friend.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.781
We're not the only ones interested
in people with powers.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.029
We'd like to contain him, yeah.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.201
The next guy will wanna exploit him,

20:36.277 --> 20:38.780
and the guy after that
will wanna dissect him.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.240
What is Centipede?

20:43.826 --> 20:47.501
Yeah, I get it, but...
Listen, Doctor, people saw me.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.001
They saw what I can do.
if I went public, that might be good.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.053
I mean, your product works.
it works amazingly, and...

20:55.463 --> 20:57.010
Yeah, yeah, I know what I signed,

20:57.089 --> 20:59.091
but if we got out in front of this, maybe...

21:00.092 --> 21:02.561
Then what? You want me to go
crawling back to the factory?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.931
I couldn't even get workman's comp
from those crooks. I don't think...

21:06.015 --> 21:07.892
Yeah... Doctor, I just thought...

21:10.269 --> 21:11.270
Okay-

21:18.277 --> 21:21.497
This was a lab.
Was this leased as a lab?

21:21.572 --> 21:23.870
Self-empowerment center.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.999
With a top-of-the-line motion sensor
security system.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.375
Ah. So a secret lab?

21:29.538 --> 21:32.462
And a superhero. Not a coincidence.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.262
So was this explosion sabotage?
Was it meant for him?

21:36.378 --> 21:39.052
Or are they just in over their heads?

21:39.715 --> 21:43.640
Yep. Working the problem.
Ladies, if you'll just... Sorry.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.436
If you're gonna be in the field,
Agent Fitz,

21:48.557 --> 21:50.059
you have to get your hands dirty.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.983
- No, I don't.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.572
Heigh-ho. Off to work you go.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.616
Centipede. it was chatter on the web,
and then, gone.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.163
I traced the access point MAC address
to that building.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.665
What were you after?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.746
The truth. What are you after?

22:11.497 --> 22:12.840
World peace.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.386
You pseudo-anarchist hacker types
love to stir things up,

22:18.170 --> 22:19.672
but you're never around for the fallout.

22:19.755 --> 22:23.055
People keep secrets for a reason, Skye.

22:23.133 --> 22:27.013
Well, just because
you're reasonable and firm

22:27.096 --> 22:31.226
doesn't mean that you're not
a evil faceless government tool bag.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.810
Just give us your guy's name.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.894
He's not my guy!

22:33.978 --> 22:35.321
You understand he's in danger.

22:35.396 --> 22:39.526
Then let me go! Let me talk to him.
Me, not the T-1000 here.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.157
You wanna be alone with him.
Of course.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.873
She's a groupie.
All this hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D.,

22:45.948 --> 22:47.541
tracking powers, she might as well be

22:47.616 --> 22:50.916
one of those sweaty cosplay girls
crowding around Stark Tower.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.005
What? I would...

22:53.539 --> 22:54.665
it was one time.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.542
Ward.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.885
Is it the girl?
She getting under your skin?

23:02.965 --> 23:04.091
Sir?

23:04.174 --> 23:05.721
Or is it the assignment?

23:05.968 --> 23:07.220
Are you so anxious to get out of this

23:07.303 --> 23:09.397
that you'd deliberately blow
an interrogation?

23:09.471 --> 23:12.975
Give me a minute alone with her,
you'll have your answers.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.105
She's an asset.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.233
She is such an... Wait, asset?

23:17.813 --> 23:18.985
We don't know anything about her.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.325
Do you appreciate
how often that happens?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.698
That never happens.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.911
We need what she knows.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.501
See, we designed each
with their own capabilities,

23:31.577 --> 23:34.046
so some recording the dimensions
and textures of the room,

23:34.121 --> 23:36.795
and then some testing the
matter density, radiation.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.751
I mean, one is basically just smelling.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.713
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've got something in something.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.842
Who's got it?

23:43.672 --> 23:44.844
Bashful.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.301
Aw.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.855
Surveillance camera. Deep-fried.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.904
Yes, but that model has flash memory
in case of brownouts.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.149
Now, I could sync that with data
from the motion detectors,

24:01.231 --> 24:04.235
and, with a little luck, get some images
from before the blast.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.947
And by "luck" I mean
"unappreciated genius."

24:08.322 --> 24:11.201
Yeah, we'll need it. Snow's reading
some compounds that are...

24:11.283 --> 24:12.956
Oh, my God.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.874
Explosive?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.382
Not of this Earth.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.301
This is QNB-T-16.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.806
It's the top-shelf martini
of sodium pentothal derivatives.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.636
It's a brand new
and extremely potent truth drug.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.139
Don't worry,
the effects only last about an hour.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.396
And you'll have a nice little nap,

24:37.059 --> 24:38.686
and we'll have
all the answers to our... Hey!

24:39.436 --> 24:41.109
What the hell!

24:41.188 --> 24:42.815
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

24:43.691 --> 24:46.410
No. But you've lost your mind.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.529
You should never do that to a member
of your team.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.740
And yes, it did hurt a little bit.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.201
But I always try and mask my pain
in front of beautiful women

24:53.283 --> 24:54.660
because I think it makes me seem
more masculine.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.041
My God, this stuff works fast.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.668
Don't trust us?
Ask him whatever you'd like.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.299
Wait a minute. Wait, you can't just...

25:04.378 --> 25:07.006
This is definitely not protocol!

25:12.094 --> 25:14.267
You seem nervous, Agent Ward.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.683
I'm calling to mind my training.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.279
There's no way I'm gonna reveal
classified secrets

25:22.396 --> 25:24.273
to a girl who's hell-bent
on taking us down.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.448
Have you ever killed anyone?

25:25.524 --> 25:29.449
Yes, a few. High-risk targets.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.868
But they were terrible people

25:32.614 --> 25:34.241
who were trying to murder nice people.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.042
And I didn't feel good afterwards.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.120
And does your grandmother know
about these things?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.840
Gramzy?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.960
My hands are tied, Mike.
It's company policy.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.921
You didn't meet quota,
I had to let you go.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.886
Gary, look, I got no choice.
It's just me and my boy now.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.434
There's no openings, Mike.
And even if there were,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.432
I got 100 guys standing in line
that are just like you,

25:54.511 --> 25:56.058
only they won't bitch
when their back hurts.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.438
I was injured, but I'm stronger now.
I can handle twice the load I used to.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.770
What are you not hearing?
You don't cut it.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.400
When I say I need things moved,
I need...

26:08.275 --> 26:09.276
Like that?

26:09.359 --> 26:10.702
Are you out of your mind?

26:14.782 --> 26:15.874
These are people, Gary.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.956
Men. Not parts you replace
when they break.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.258
It's not me, man. It's the company.
I'm not the bad guy.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.210
I'm not the bad guy, man.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.632
Yes, you are.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.214
It's simple now.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.554
Just like we used to read about.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.889
You're the bad guy.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.855
And I'm the hero.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.817
Did Agent Ward give you anything?

26:45.896 --> 26:49.241
He told me he's been to Paris,
but he's never really seen it

26:49.316 --> 26:52.536
and that he wishes you had
stayed in Tahiti.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.658
It's a magical place.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.784
Ward doesn't like your style.
I kind of think I do.

26:57.950 --> 26:58.997
What about his?

26:59.076 --> 27:00.578
...remains in critical condition.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.959
Employees could not identify
the attacker,

27:03.038 --> 27:06.793
but security footage confirms that
this man assaulted the factory foreman

27:06.875 --> 27:08.969
before damaging thousands of dollars'
worth of company property...

27:09.044 --> 27:13.049
This is wrong. This is not the guy I met.
He was...

27:15.801 --> 27:16.927
He just needs a break.

27:17.511 --> 27:20.390
Then give him one. What have you got?

27:24.643 --> 27:27.897
Michael Peterson.
Factory worker, married, one kid.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.904
Gets injured, gets laid off,
wife jumps ship.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.985
Good guy, bad breaks.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.781
Best guess is, somebody tells him
they can make him strong again.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.241
Make him super.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.327
Who has the tech to do that?
And why would they want to?

27:41.493 --> 27:44.087
Fitz, what do we have from the
security footage'? Before the blast.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.549
What are we seeing?

27:47.875 --> 27:51.300
Well, the man is angry at the other man.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.340
The data is very corrupt.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.426
- Yeah, like Cold War Russia corrupt.
-Yeah.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.182
I can't sync the time code without...

27:59.261 --> 28:00.478
What if you had the audio?

28:01.722 --> 28:03.349
I was running surveillance on the lab.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.685
I had my shotgun mic pointed at
the window before the blast.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.485
The digital file's in my van.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.734
There's too much background noise
for me, but you could probably...

28:09.813 --> 28:10.860
You can clean that up, can't you?

28:10.939 --> 28:12.612
Find a sync point and use cross-filed
validation to find...

28:12.691 --> 28:14.785
But I can't scrub for expression patterns
when the VITC is all...

28:14.860 --> 28:16.533
Well, is there
a chrominance subcarrier?

28:16.612 --> 28:18.865
Yeah, attached to the back porch.
Brilliant.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.790
- That audio would be great.
-We will take that audio, please.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.163
Thank you very, very much.

28:22.242 --> 28:26.122
Your van's here. But you were right.
We couldn't decrypt the files.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.048
The encryption's coupled to the GPS.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.801
Get my van back to that alley,
and then I'm in business.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.837
Agent May will escort you.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.006
And on your way out, wake up Ward.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.565
You're...

28:51.271 --> 28:52.944
Wow, you're him.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.201
I'm glad you're doing okay.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.530
Yeah. Thank you. They're beautiful.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.621
What the hell are you doing here?

29:04.034 --> 29:05.251
I don't know where to go, Doctor.

29:06.453 --> 29:10.128
Everything's getting...
I know what's right, I do.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.964
But no one will listen to me.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.929
I volunteered because
you said things would change.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.723
You said you could keep it together.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.384
Our first subject lost it,

29:20.467 --> 29:22.390
walked into the lab
with a freaking bomb...

29:22.469 --> 29:23.766
I'm not like him.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.307
Well, tell that to your foreman
in the ICU.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.391
I saved you!

29:27.474 --> 29:29.442
You exposed me!

29:30.352 --> 29:32.195
You exposed the program.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.989
The people who gave me this
technology, they are very serious

29:38.151 --> 29:40.119
and they do not want to be revealed.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.240
Mike Peterson needs to disappear.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.492
You're right.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.087
I'm not him anymore.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.502
I'm someone else now.

29:52.207 --> 29:55.302
Please. You're juiced, Mike!

29:55.419 --> 29:58.013
And you're losing it
just like the last guy.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.054
God, this is a disaster.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.388
No.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.849
It's an origin story.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.233
Audio file should be coming through.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.856
It's not compressed,
so it might take a minute.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.563
--Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm getting it.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.823
So, when you get back,
I'll show you my thing.

30:20.277 --> 30:24.953
A thing. It's not... It's my hardware.
My equipment! Let's hang up.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.002
So the alien metal wasn't the explosive?

30:29.077 --> 30:32.957
Well, I assumed from the break pattern
and dispersion that it was.

30:33.123 --> 30:36.923
But it's just dripping with
gamma radiation and...

30:37.044 --> 30:38.170
Ugh!

30:38.545 --> 30:41.640
Now it's actually dripping. Fun!

30:42.007 --> 30:43.179
So what did that get us?

30:43.258 --> 30:45.602
Skye's sending us the rest of her
decrypted files on Centipede,

30:45.677 --> 30:47.350
but we have her audio. I've loaded it up.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.772
Nice work.

30:49.556 --> 30:53.026
Using motion estimation,
Bayesian inference,

30:53.143 --> 30:55.737
a beam splitter and a little
diffraction theory,

30:56.188 --> 31:00.034
our mystery man appears.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.619
It's like magic, but it's science.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.995
Explosives in the case?

31:08.075 --> 31:10.544
Please, calm down.
Just, let me check your vitals.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.213
I feel fine. I want to feel more.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.336
Where's the doctor? Where is she?

31:15.749 --> 31:18.127
If you don't settle down,
I'll have you sedated.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.632
Where is she?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.222
Wait, did you see that on his arm?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.051
What does that
look like to you?

31:27.177 --> 31:28.474
A centipede.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.306
It's an intravenous filter for his blood.
This goo, sir?

31:31.390 --> 31:34.314
Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine
developed in the '40s for the...

31:34.393 --> 31:35.565
Super-soldiers.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.989
I'm reading alien metal,
gamma radiation, the serum.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.193
Every known source of superpower,
thrown in a blender.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.527
We need to see the origin of the blast.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.033
Run it back from the last point recorded.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.086
That should do it.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.333
Let's head back.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.505
All right. Let me just...

32:00.210 --> 32:01.757
Mike!

32:01.837 --> 32:03.089
What are you doing?

32:03.171 --> 32:06.641
Saving you.
From the scary men in dark suits.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.093
And you're gonna help save us.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.099
"Us"?

32:11.680 --> 32:15.560
Don't cry, okay? Stay strong for me, Ace.

32:15.892 --> 32:16.984
What are we?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.061
We're a team.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.488
That's right. Now drive!

32:27.696 --> 32:32.327
EXTREMIS. It's new.
Completely unstable.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.624
Poor man didn't bring an explosive.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.914
And Mike has the same stuff
in his system.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.543
Well, judging by his strength level,
a lot more.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.343
So any minute now, Mike is gonna...

32:42.419 --> 32:44.137
He'll take out anyone
within a two-block radius.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.933
Well, you wanted a bomb.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.649
Sir? He didn't explode
because he was angry.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.275
The two are connected.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.697
Well, it's kind of a chemical surge,

33:02.772 --> 33:04.365
but calming him down
will buy him a minute at most.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.868
He will detonate within
the next few hours.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.074
Solution?

33:08.945 --> 33:10.697
Isolate him? Get him away from people?

33:10.780 --> 33:11.781
Or?

33:11.865 --> 33:13.117
Put a bullet through his brain.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.253
If he's dead, this irradiated
metabolic process will stop.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.209
You need to come up
with a third option.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.340
One that doesn't involve Mike's son
losing a father.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.013
We have a couple of hours at most.
There's no way that we could possibly...

33:27.088 --> 33:29.341
Don't ever tell me there's no way!

33:30.091 --> 33:32.469
It's on you. Get it done.

33:38.475 --> 33:39.476
May.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.019
He took Skye.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.188
You're all right?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.654
We'll deal with that later. At length.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.361
Right now we need to figure out
where they went.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.001
How long is this gonna take?

34:04.084 --> 34:05.586
This is top speed, trust me.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.421
It's not like I'm deleting
a Facebook page.

34:07.504 --> 34:12.054
I'm bypassing the License Bureau's
AES protected data stream. So, chill.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.719
How do I know you can really do this?

34:15.512 --> 34:16.638
I've done it before.

34:22.226 --> 34:26.447
Come on, give me more paralysis,
less rigor mortis! Come on!

34:26.648 --> 34:27.991
No, no, no.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.989
Just pretend it's an exam.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.905
We're taking an exam.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.741
- An exam? Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:35.824 --> 34:40.420
Okay. I don't want an
"F" equals a massacre.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.668
--Whoa!

34:46.251 --> 34:49.755
Oh, no! What is this nonsense?
Why are you making nonsense?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.010
This isn't me!

34:51.089 --> 34:53.262
It's noise. Someone's hacking
our secure channel.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.348
It's longitude and latitude.

34:55.677 --> 34:56.768
Mike took Skye.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.139
She's telling us where.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.861
We'll take the nice lady with us.

35:07.188 --> 35:10.112
We can't go to the airport,
so we'll take a train.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.945
And there, she'll help us start over.

35:13.445 --> 35:18.201
Make a new life. A better life.
Like I always said.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.376
Look at this place.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.054
You're gonna risk thousands of lives
over some nobody?

35:31.171 --> 35:34.550
Nobody's nobody, Ward.
Fitz-Simmons will come through.

35:35.050 --> 35:39.055
Mr. Peterson, good morning.
We're not a threat, we're here to help.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.389
But you're in danger and
we need to take you in.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.565
What did you do?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.920
You're right, he is a little bitch!

36:12.420 --> 36:14.514
- Go on, get her! Get her!
-Ace, get back.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.517
Man, get out the way, man!
Come on! Come on, now.

36:24.808 --> 36:25.809
Ace!

36:32.565 --> 36:33.691
Tell dispatch we need backup!

36:40.907 --> 36:42.705
Hey. Let's get him out of here.

36:42.784 --> 36:43.785
Help my daddy.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.960
- I promise.
-Come on, honey.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.789
Ace ! Ace !

36:50.125 --> 36:54.471
Look. The stuff inside you is unstable.
It'll kill you and everyone in here.

36:54.587 --> 36:55.804
Who's gonna miss us?

37:16.151 --> 37:17.994
We're at the north entrance, May.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.912
We told them to hold fire.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.080
I don't think that's us.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.079
We may have a third party here.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.752
He's gonna head down to the tracks.
You stay high, I'll go low.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.831
Only take the shot if you have to, Ward.
Ward!

37:29.247 --> 37:30.749
If I have to.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.680
You've got to stop.
These people can help you.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.515
The men in suits?
They're your buddies, now?

37:39.632 --> 37:41.134
Where'd they take my son?

37:54.439 --> 37:55.440
Get down!

38:32.685 --> 38:34.813
You think that means anything?

38:34.896 --> 38:37.695
I know you got men everywhere waiting
to put me down.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.738
I know how this plays out.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.035
I don't.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.239
I know you got poison in your system.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.825
I know it's burning you up.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.204
Mike, the last guy who wore
that exploded.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.543
I'm not like that other guy. I'm...

38:53.915 --> 38:59.092
it matters who I am, inside,
if I'm a good person, if I'm strong.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.598
I have a clear shot. Do you copy?

39:02.757 --> 39:03.883
I know you're strong.

39:04.425 --> 39:07.520
Your boy knows it.
He needs you to let us help.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.938
You took him!

39:09.430 --> 39:13.435
You took my wife, my job, my house.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.279
You think this is killing me?

39:16.604 --> 39:20.450
All over, there's people
being pushed down, being robbed.

39:20.525 --> 39:24.200
One of them tries to stand up,
you got to make an example out of him.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.031
You bring this building down on us,
will that help them?

39:26.114 --> 39:28.617
That's a lie! All you do is lie!

39:33.913 --> 39:35.711
You said if we worked hard,

39:37.458 --> 39:38.755
if we did right,

39:41.087 --> 39:42.304
we'd have a place.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.305
You said it was enough to be a man.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.137
But there's better than man.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.272
There's gods.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.732
And the rest of us, what are we?

39:57.645 --> 39:58.817
They're giants.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.149
We're what they step on.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.657
I know.

40:06.946 --> 40:11.497
I've seen giants up close.
And that privilege cost me.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.499
Nearly everything.

40:14.329 --> 40:17.003
But the good ones, the real deal?

40:17.790 --> 40:19.918
They're not heroes because of what
they have that we don't.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.423
It's what they do with it.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.512
You're right, Mike.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.724
It matters who you are.

40:28.635 --> 40:29.887
I could, you know?

40:31.679 --> 40:32.896
Be a hero.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.528
I'm counting on it.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.239
Subject is
in stable condition.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.580
All clear at Union Station.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.474
I told him his father was coming home.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.221
He will.
We have some experience with this.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.108
He almost blew. We almost died.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.481
We have some experience
with that, too.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.112
You don't have it all mapped out.

42:03.229 --> 42:06.449
True. We didn't cut off the head
of the Centipede.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.827
Whoever sponsored that little
experiment is still out there.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.328
Among other things.

42:12.447 --> 42:16.293
It's a brave new world,
and a really old car.

42:16.409 --> 42:17.956
Lola can keep up.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.457
What about you?
Have you thought about the offer?

42:22.749 --> 42:26.754
Hitching a ride on the crazy plane?
Not exactly a team player.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.844
We're not exactly a team.
But we're in a position to do some good.

42:30.965 --> 42:31.966
You'd be a great help.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.310
And you'd be front row center at
the strangest show on Earth,

42:34.427 --> 42:36.850
which is, after all, what you wanted.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.771
I was able to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.
from my van.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.523
Are you gonna show me
something new?

42:44.979 --> 42:46.026
Go.

42:46.481 --> 42:47.983
Sir? We've got an 084.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.324
Is that confirmed?

42:50.193 --> 42:52.321
They want us to go in and confirm it.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.160
What's an 084?

42:58.117 --> 43:00.711
You've got exactly 10 minutes to decide
if you really wanna know.

43:01.871 --> 43:04.090
There's no way we can make it to
the airfield in...

43:07.043 --> 43:08.215
...10 minutes.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.057
The tide is rising.
