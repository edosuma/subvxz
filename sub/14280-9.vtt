I will name him "Scraps"!

11:12.478 --> 11:16.978
‐ My new apprentice!
‐ [gasps] What'd I do?
Don't hurt me!

11:17.012 --> 11:19.678
‐ [gags]
‐ Congratulations, Chowder,

11:19.712 --> 11:22.178
In no time at all,
you'll be grown up,

11:22.212 --> 11:26.278
[vomits]
[groans]

11:26.312 --> 11:29.078
Said "grown up,"
not "thrown up,"

11:35.978 --> 11:38.812
Uh, ,, hi?

11:38.845 --> 11:40.478
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

11:40.512 --> 11:43.278
‐ Chowder!
‐ It wasn't me!

11:43.312 --> 11:45.345
You promised me you'd grow up!

11:45.378 --> 11:49.545
We're all counting on you,
Chowder, Don't let me down,

11:49.578 --> 11:52.878
Don't worry,
everybody, You can count on me,

11:52.912 --> 11:55.212
[laughs nervously]

11:55.245 --> 11:58.278
Oh, no!
I don't know what I'm doing,

11:58.312 --> 12:01.478
Okay, Chowder ‐‐ think, Think,

12:01.512 --> 12:04.845
Aaaaah!
The thinking ‐‐ it hurts!

12:04.878 --> 12:07.978
[thinking] Ignore the pain,
Chowder, Be a master!

12:08.012 --> 12:12.178
Got to be like, ,,
like, ,, Mung,

12:15.545 --> 12:19.345
Hey, that was easier
than I thought,
But now what do I do?!

12:19.378 --> 12:22.945
[thinking] Maybe if I don't
move, things will be okay,

12:22.978 --> 12:26.978
‐ Cook something!
‐ Right ‐‐ c‐cook something,

12:27.012 --> 12:29.945
All right, Scraps,
you and I are going to cook,

12:29.978 --> 12:32.812
We're just gonna follow this
simple recipe for, ,,

12:32.845 --> 12:37.145
a piece of cake,
Oh, good, That sounds easy,

12:37.178 --> 12:39.478
Step 1 ‐‐ put an egg in a bowl,

12:39.512 --> 12:42.712
Okay, We got this,
Egg in a bowl,

12:42.745 --> 12:45.312
Egg, ,,in a bowl,

12:45.345 --> 12:49.312
Aaah! I'm a failure!
I can't do this!

12:49.345 --> 12:51.812
You're all better off
without me here!

12:51.845 --> 12:55.578
‐ [door closes]
‐ narrator: And so Chowder
left Marzipan, ,,

12:57.178 --> 12:58.878
[sighs]

12:58.912 --> 13:02.178
narrator:, ,, and walked many
miles looking for a place

13:02.212 --> 13:03.645
where he could be alone,

13:03.678 --> 13:06.812
And at last found himself
in the sands

13:06.845 --> 13:09.578
of the Shmahara Dessert,

13:11.012 --> 13:12.945
‐ [sizzle]
‐ Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

13:12.978 --> 13:16.212
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

13:16.245 --> 13:19.978
Bleeehhhh, ,, bleeehhh, ,,

13:20.012 --> 13:22.445
‐ [slurp] ‐ [pop]

13:22.478 --> 13:26.345
Hee hee, Better, [sighs]

13:26.378 --> 13:29.145
H‐hey, find your own shade, bro,

13:29.178 --> 13:30.778
Whew!

13:30.812 --> 13:33.378
My new life in
the dessert sure is hard,

13:33.412 --> 13:36.945
I'm glad I brought along my
backpack full of food,

13:36.978 --> 13:41.812
Good ol' food,
Sweet, tender, delicious
foo‐o‐o‐o‐d!

13:41.845 --> 13:44.045
I love my food,

13:44.078 --> 13:46.212
[coughs]
Hi, Mr, Chowder,

13:46.245 --> 13:47.778
I couldn't let you go alone,

13:47.812 --> 13:49.545
You're the only one who ever
believed in me,

13:49.578 --> 13:51.545
Scraps?
But where's the food?

13:51.578 --> 13:54.345
Oh, and I left all the food
back at the kitchen,

13:55.078 --> 13:56.478
Bad Scraps!

13:56.512 --> 14:00.178
Very, very bad Scraps!
Now we're gonna starve!

14:00.212 --> 14:03.778
[sobbing] Starve!

14:03.812 --> 14:07.345
Don't worry, Scraps,
I wouldn't let anything
happen to you,

14:07.378 --> 14:09.178
narrator: Two seconds later, ,,

14:09.212 --> 14:11.145
Sorry, Scraps,

14:11.178 --> 14:13.678
I let everything happen to you,

14:13.712 --> 14:16.312
At least I can be
your master in death,

14:16.345 --> 14:19.378
I'd be honored
to follow you, sir,

14:34.912 --> 14:37.212
[echoing]
Where am I?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.845
[raspy voice] Relax,
I'm not going to eat you,

14:40.878 --> 14:43.312
I'm going to eat, ,,your friend,

14:43.345 --> 14:46.345
[laughs, wheezes]
That's just a little
dessert humor,

14:46.378 --> 14:48.712
Look, Chowder! Ho! It's me!

14:48.745 --> 14:53.012
‐ Gazpacho!
‐ But enough about me,

14:53.045 --> 14:56.645
Tell me about you! Who is your
delicious‐looking friend?

14:56.678 --> 15:00.178
‐ Where's your jet packs?
‐ Uhhhhh, ,,

15:00.212 --> 15:04.378
‐ Where's all the ladies?
‐ Mm, ,, uhhhhh, ,,

15:04.412 --> 15:06.978
Was it all a lie?

15:07.012 --> 15:09.112
Buh‐buh‐buh‐buh‐buh‐buh, ,,

15:09.145 --> 15:11.545
[sobbing] Oh, it's true!
It's true!

15:11.578 --> 15:16.445
It was a lie!
My whole life, ,,is a lie!

15:16.478 --> 15:19.612
Mr, Chowder? Is that thing
still gonna eat me?

15:19.645 --> 15:23.145
Gazpacho,
I don't understand,
How did this happen?

15:23.178 --> 15:25.678
[snorts]
Well, it all started when Mother

15:25.712 --> 15:28.178
said it was time for me
to grow up, ,,

15:28.212 --> 15:31.645
and get a real job,
like accounting, Blech!

15:31.678 --> 15:34.012
Plus, the fact
that I can't do math!

15:34.045 --> 15:38.312
‐ [crackle]
‐ So I did what any
self‐respecting failure

15:38.345 --> 15:39.845
would do ‐‐ I hid,

15:39.878 --> 15:43.045
Well, actually, I cried like a
baby for a week first,

15:43.078 --> 15:46.178
‐ Then I hid,
‐ [gasps] This story
is so relatable,

15:46.212 --> 15:49.178
But now it's just me
and my man cave,

15:49.212 --> 15:51.812
where nothing
can hurt me ever again,

15:53.845 --> 15:55.845
Except for the scorpions,

15:55.878 --> 15:58.078
‐ The venom burns,
‐ Is this the life
I thought I wanted?

16:00.512 --> 16:03.145
‐ The venom burns,
‐ Is this the life
I thought I wanted?

16:03.178 --> 16:04.612
Yeah, the life here is great,

16:04.645 --> 16:06.512
[strained] You should totally
stay with me ‐‐

16:06.545 --> 16:10.478
here in the man cave,
We can hide from, ,,reality,

16:10.512 --> 16:13.378
Well, I don't know,
Seems a little terrifying,

16:13.412 --> 16:16.312
Please, Chowder,
Please stay, I'm so lonely,

16:16.345 --> 16:19.978
And I need someone
to suck the venom out,

16:22.745 --> 16:25.945
You know, when I was young,
I always wanted to open

16:25.978 --> 16:27.778
what I call
"The Fruit Stand‐up,"

16:27.812 --> 16:31.612
This crazy idea ‐‐ I do stand‐up
comedy whilst customers

16:31.645 --> 16:34.312
‐ buy my fruit and vegetables,
‐ Wow!

16:34.345 --> 16:36.478
That's the best idea
you've ever had!

16:36.512 --> 16:39.845
‐ Girl, why ain't you did it?
‐ Well, Mother says growing up

16:39.878 --> 16:43.278
is about doing what's expected
of you, not what you want to do,

16:43.312 --> 16:46.845
Hmm,
Gazpacho, maybe‐‐
just maybe‐‐

16:46.878 --> 16:51.045
‐ your mother's wrong?
‐ Shush! Shush!
She might hear you,

16:51.078 --> 16:53.545
No, for reals,
You're a talented dude,

16:53.578 --> 16:56.712
Dudes like you don't live in
caves with gross scorpions,

16:56.745 --> 17:00.612
‐ That stings!
‐ Hey, maybe ‐‐
maybe you're right!

17:00.645 --> 17:03.112
But what about you? Why are you
hiding in the dessert?

17:03.145 --> 17:04.812
You ‐‐ you were built to cook!

17:04.845 --> 17:07.178
Scraps: Mr, Chowder,
you made cooking fun,

17:07.212 --> 17:10.045
For the first time in my life,
I'm not scared,

17:10.078 --> 17:13.345
Seriously, who is this guy?
Can we eat him yet or what?

17:13.378 --> 17:17.378
This guy? This guy is Scraps,
my apprentice,

17:17.412 --> 17:19.478
And I am his cooking master,

17:19.512 --> 17:22.345
And, so help me,
before the night is done,

17:22.378 --> 17:27.645
we shall cook a dish together!

17:27.678 --> 17:30.545
So we're not eating him, then?!

17:31.345 --> 17:33.145
Mung Daal: Chowder's back!

17:33.178 --> 17:35.812
And I'm large and in charge!

17:35.845 --> 17:38.178
Look, I'm glad you came back,
Here's a recipe,

17:38.212 --> 17:42.478
Just follow it, and you'll
become a master chef,
That's all I ask of you,

17:42.512 --> 17:44.445
But that's just it, Mung,

17:44.478 --> 17:47.378
There is something I've needed
to do for a long time,

17:47.412 --> 17:53.145
‐ Radda radda?
‐ Thank you, Shnitzel,
But what I mean is this,

17:53.178 --> 17:56.478
He ripped up
the recipe! That's my last
chance for retirement!

17:56.512 --> 18:00.012
Trust your heart, Chowder,
Oh, no! Not the venom!

18:00.045 --> 18:03.045
‐ Why the face?!
‐ Gazpacho's right,

18:03.078 --> 18:07.878
I must trust the dream in my
heart, not the venom in my face,

18:09.012 --> 18:10.778
Quick, Scraps,
Quick like a bunny,

18:10.812 --> 18:13.812
‐ We need to find a new recipe,
‐ Uh, ,, uh, ,, uh, ,,

18:13.845 --> 18:17.045
‐ Quick like
a cute little bunny!
‐ Eeeeeeee!

18:17.078 --> 18:19.712
Sorry,
It's the pressure talking,

18:19.745 --> 18:23.545
‐ A cute little bunny!
‐ Oh, Hmm,

18:23.578 --> 18:27.945
‐ How about, ,,
hard‐boiled schmegg?
‐ Way too complicated,

18:27.978 --> 18:29.712
‐ Carrot stick?
‐ Even worse!

18:29.745 --> 18:31.712
‐ Cup of water?
‐ I don't even know

18:31.745 --> 18:34.045
how to begin to get my head
around that one!

18:34.078 --> 18:36.478
I need you to think
outside the box,

18:36.512 --> 18:39.312
I think I just made
a big mess in my pants,

18:39.345 --> 18:42.312
‐ [ding]
‐ That gives me an idea!

18:42.345 --> 18:44.545
[clattering]

18:46.178 --> 18:47.812
both: ♪ La la la la la la

18:47.845 --> 18:51.412
♪ La la la la la la la
♪ La la la la la la la

18:53.178 --> 18:55.345
Oh, Chowder,

18:55.378 --> 18:58.712
You get some sort of sick kick
out of making me cry?!

18:58.745 --> 19:03.045
‐ What do you talk?
‐ I've seen some
pretty sad dishes in my day,

19:03.078 --> 19:05.012
but that one really
takes the cake,

19:05.045 --> 19:07.145
Yeah, takes the cake all

19:07.178 --> 19:10.312
‐ the way to the vomitorium!
‐ But I ‐‐ but I tried
really hard,

19:10.345 --> 19:12.612
And I did it my way, And, ,,

19:12.645 --> 19:16.178
‐ And it's still a disaster,
‐ It's not a disaster!

19:16.212 --> 19:18.145
Well, what recipe
did you follow?

19:18.178 --> 19:19.712
I didn't follow a recipe,

19:19.745 --> 19:22.012
Well, what did you
do ‐‐ make one up?

19:22.045 --> 19:25.812
‐ Yes, Is that bad?
‐ No,

19:25.845 --> 19:29.145
‐ I say it's pretty darn good,
‐ Scraps?

19:29.178 --> 19:31.145
No, Scraps!
Don't eat it!

19:31.178 --> 19:35.112
[chomp, chomp]
[gulps] Mmmmmmm!

19:35.145 --> 19:38.712
Hey! Scraps ate it
and didn't die!

19:38.745 --> 19:43.145
That's right,
And you should all try it,
Chowder worked really hard,

19:43.178 --> 19:46.512
And so did my new
apprentice, Scraps,

19:46.545 --> 19:49.512
[chomp, chomp, chomp]
Mmmm! Mm! Mmm!

19:49.545 --> 19:53.012
You know, it may be half baked,
but it's not half bad,

19:53.045 --> 19:57.345
‐ What do you call it, Chowder?
‐ I call it "Chowder's
Big Mess Cake"!

19:57.378 --> 19:59.812
Well, it should be
your signature dish

19:59.845 --> 20:02.145
when you take over
the catering company,

20:02.178 --> 20:04.478
because I declare ‐‐
this dish is a success!

20:04.512 --> 20:07.145
[gasps]
So I did it?

20:07.178 --> 20:09.478
[voice deepens] Yaaaaay!

20:09.512 --> 20:11.478
I think I just became a man,

20:11.512 --> 20:15.345
And so, with Chowder finally
having grown up,

20:15.378 --> 20:18.212
everyone was able to move on
with their lives,

20:18.245 --> 20:21.545
Mung and Truffles
retired to Boca,

20:21.578 --> 20:23.478
Ladies,

20:25.412 --> 20:26.845
narrator: Gorgonzola could be

20:26.878 --> 20:30.045
happy now that he had
a peer to brag to,

20:30.078 --> 20:32.112
Ha! I'm richer than you!

20:32.145 --> 20:33.978
Yeah, but I'm still
taller than you,

20:34.012 --> 20:36.312
[claps]

20:36.345 --> 20:39.612
Ha! Now I'm taller than you!
I win!

20:39.645 --> 20:41.712
‐ Win what?
‐ I win at life!

20:41.745 --> 20:45.478
‐ Oh, congratulations,
‐ Don't ‐‐ don't
congratulate me!

20:45.512 --> 20:48.778
Be jealous!
Be jealous, darn you!

20:48.812 --> 20:51.478
Narrator: Shnitzel discovered
he actually enjoyed

20:51.512 --> 20:56.545
being married to Endive,
Want seconds on pie, my love?

20:56.578 --> 20:59.178
‐ Radda radda, ‐ Oh, wait,

20:59.212 --> 21:01.312
You have some crumbs
on your face,

21:01.345 --> 21:04.045
‐ Let me clean them off,
‐ [smack]

21:04.078 --> 21:08.712
[slobbering]

21:08.745 --> 21:12.145
Ra, ,, radda,

21:12.178 --> 21:15.845
Mama needs seconds, too,

21:15.878 --> 21:19.312
narrator: Gazpacho got the
guts to open his dream store,

21:19.345 --> 21:22.612
So, why did tomato turn red?
Ooh!

21:22.645 --> 21:25.812
'cause he saw
the salad dressing!

21:25.845 --> 21:27.645
‐ [laughter]
‐ Ha! Yes!

21:27.678 --> 21:31.778
[laughing] That's funny, ,,
'cause it's true,

21:31.812 --> 21:34.178
narrator: Chowder finally
became the master

21:34.212 --> 21:36.312
and took over
the catering company,

21:36.345 --> 21:39.345
And that's how we
make mustachio ice cream,

21:39.378 --> 21:42.812
[chomp]
[coughs] Hair ball!

21:42.845 --> 21:44.378
Panini: Numnums?

21:44.412 --> 21:47.445
Narrator: And, of course,
he married Panini,

21:47.478 --> 21:50.512
I'm taking our 50
babies out for a walkie‐walk,

21:50.545 --> 21:52.178
Chowder: I thought we
only had 30 babies,

21:52.212 --> 21:54.478
I had 20 more yesterday!

21:54.512 --> 21:57.712
‐ Yes, I did,
‐ Oh, Hi, new babies!

21:57.745 --> 21:59.712
Hi, daddy!

21:59.745 --> 22:03.045
[normal voice] No!
Stop! Hold it!

22:03.078 --> 22:06.345
I reject this future!
It's evil! Evil!

22:06.378 --> 22:09.345
But, Chowder, we look
so happy together,

22:09.378 --> 22:11.645
I'm not your boyfriend!

22:11.678 --> 22:14.212
Just look at all our babies,

22:14.245 --> 22:16.978
‐ I refuse to look!
‐ Man, we were cute kids,

22:17.012 --> 22:20.112
‐ Yeah,
‐ But seriously,
no more babies, okay?

22:20.145 --> 22:22.678
Help! Help!
The babies got me!

22:22.712 --> 22:24.045
Okay, I'll stop,

22:24.078 --> 22:26.045
Babies, no!
Put Scraps down!

22:26.078 --> 22:27.712
Babies!

22:27.745 --> 22:30.845
‐ [indistinct shouting]
‐ [crashing, clattering]

22:34.345 --> 22:36.445
Shnitzel!
I just had the craziest dream,

22:36.478 --> 22:39.045
It was 20 years into the future,
What do you think it means?

22:39.078 --> 22:41.712
‐ Radda radda,
‐ [gasps] Huh? What?

22:41.745 --> 22:44.645
Wow, Shnitzel, I just had a
dream that I had a dream,

22:44.678 --> 22:46.878
and you were explaining
my dream in the dream,

22:46.912 --> 22:50.812
‐ What do you suppose it means?
‐ Radda radda radda radda,

22:50.845 --> 22:52.478
[gasps]
Huh? What?

22:52.512 --> 22:54.554
Shnitzel, I just had a dream
that I had a dream that I had

22:54.578 --> 22:57.145
a dream that you
were explaining my dream

22:57.178 --> 22:58.512
in the dream while dreaming,

22:58.545 --> 23:00.312
What do you suppose that means?

23:00.345 --> 23:02.845
[sighs]
Oh, radda,
