00:13.138 --> 00:16.183
Tonight we take part
in our first ever motor race...

00:17.226 --> 00:21.605
James tests the new Fiat 500
near some youths on bicycles,

00:22.606 --> 00:24.733
and the Ascari A10.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.027
Just how fast is this thing?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.617
(Cheering)

00:34.660 --> 00:37.204
Hello. Hello and welcome.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.580
Thanks very much. Thank you.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.669
Now, last year, you may remember,
we borrowed some tractors

00:43.752 --> 00:47.297
and we planted 25 acres of oilseed rape.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.550
The idea was that we were going to harvest it,

00:49.633 --> 00:54.680
and then turn the seeds
into juicy, eco-friendly petrol,

00:54.763 --> 00:58.225
full of natural, dew-picked,
farm-fresh goodness.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.980
Unfortunately, James bought the wrong seeds.

01:04.188 --> 01:08.861
We ended up with 500 gallons of...
and there's no other way of saying this...

01:09.820 --> 01:11.613
...diesel.

01:12.364 --> 01:16.201
500 gallons of hemorrhoid cream
would have been more useful, honestly.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.787
We hate diesel, so we decided to burn it.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.832
Even though the three of us
have no racing experience,

01:21.874 --> 01:26.712
we entered the Britcar 24-hour race
at Silverstone with a diesel car.

01:42.045 --> 01:44.005
All we needed was a car, so we got one,

01:44.089 --> 01:47.092
and then, while James was moonlighting
on his wine program,

01:47.175 --> 01:50.804
Jeremy and I
went down to the Top Gear Technology Centre.

01:53.181 --> 01:56.768
Here it is,
the crucible of all our great inventions.

01:58.437 --> 02:00.605
This is the car we bought.

02:00.689 --> 02:05.110
It's a BMW 330d, four years old,
done 45,000 miles.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.112
We paid eleven grand for it.

02:07.154 --> 02:09.990
And now we must turn it into a racing car,

02:10.073 --> 02:14.202
by bolting lots of racing car bits to it.

02:15.078 --> 02:20.041
The director of the Top Gear Technology Centre,
Steve, would do all the trivial jobs,

02:20.125 --> 02:24.171
like the brakes, the engine,
the suspension and the electronics,

02:24.254 --> 02:26.715
while we did the big stuff.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.759
I had to do the race seat.

02:29.801 --> 02:33.054
Jeremy, meanwhile,
had to install a long-range fuel tank.

02:47.110 --> 02:49.070
Got a hammer?

02:55.494 --> 02:58.914
(Jeremy) With that not done,
I checked on Hammond.

02:58.997 --> 03:01.541
Yes! The office!

03:01.625 --> 03:03.376
That feels businesslike.

03:03.460 --> 03:04.836
Hammond.

03:04.878 --> 03:07.464
- What?
- Do you understand endurance racing?

03:07.506 --> 03:09.508
- Yeah.
- 24-hour race, three drivers.

03:09.549 --> 03:11.259
Do you want to hop out?

03:11.343 --> 03:14.304
So let's just say you do the first stint,
here's the driver change.

03:14.387 --> 03:17.933
You get out, the car's been refueled,
it's my turn to get in.

03:18.016 --> 03:20.727
Yeah, it will be a bit of a squeeze for you,
I grant you.

03:20.811 --> 03:23.188
It won't be a bit of a squeeze, mate.
It will be...

03:23.271 --> 03:26.066
There you go. You're in.

03:26.149 --> 03:30.070
Vroom vroom vroom, all the other cars,
those are the noises of them.

03:30.153 --> 03:35.408
Meanwhile, back in the Top Gear pit,
Jeremy... You'd have to get a saw.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.662
Well... Yeah.

03:38.745 --> 03:42.707
Right, I'll put the seat on runners,
so it'll be more boring.

03:42.791 --> 03:45.627
(Jeremy)
Next, we needed a drinks delivery system.

03:45.710 --> 03:49.172
Most are rubbish,
so I made ours battery powered.

03:49.256 --> 03:50.924
(Crackling)

03:51.007 --> 03:53.635
OK, so when you want a drink, which you will,

03:53.718 --> 03:55.345
you put that in your mouth.

03:55.429 --> 03:58.390
- Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
- (Muffled) I am squeezing it!

03:59.558 --> 04:01.393
Aha! Does that work?

04:01.476 --> 04:04.563
Well, it's not brilliant, if I'm honest.

04:04.646 --> 04:07.149
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's flawed.

04:07.232 --> 04:11.361
To make it look like a racing car,
we needed sponsors' names.

04:11.403 --> 04:14.865
But sadly, because of BBC rules
we couldn't get real ones.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.367
So we just sort of made some up.

04:17.409 --> 04:20.411
Look at that!
That looks like a racing car already.

04:20.495 --> 04:22.831
- It looks like a racing car.
- It needed that, didn't it?

04:22.914 --> 04:26.585
With the car almost ready,
our thoughts turned to the race itself.

04:27.586 --> 04:30.589
You know I said, "How hard can it be?"
When we started this?

04:30.630 --> 04:32.090
Yes.

04:32.132 --> 04:35.093
If I'm honest,
I think it's going to be really hard.

04:35.135 --> 04:39.055
I'm quite glad you said that, cos
it's crossed my mind. I'm getting a bit nervous.

04:39.097 --> 04:42.684
I don't want to win,
but I want people to take us seriously.

04:42.768 --> 04:45.187
I just think we're going to look ridiculous.

04:49.649 --> 04:54.154
We arrived at Silverstone assuming
the Britcar 24 would be an amateur event

04:54.237 --> 04:56.281
for beginners like us.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.366
We were badly wrong.

05:02.579 --> 05:08.627
In fact, our diesel Beemer
would be up against 200 mph supercars.

05:09.711 --> 05:13.715
The other drivers
were chisel-jawed and battle-hardened.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.761
They had blue chip sponsors,
tonnes of equipment.

05:17.803 --> 05:23.100
They'd turned up with laptops
and luxury motorhomes with girls in them.

05:24.309 --> 05:27.437
0ur motorhome
wasn't quite as professional as that.

05:27.479 --> 05:30.190
And nor was our catering.

05:30.273 --> 05:32.025
And nor was our car.

05:32.109 --> 05:33.944
In fact, nothing was.

05:36.321 --> 05:38.657
And then there was the question of us three.

05:39.324 --> 05:45.580
You realize we are the only people in this field,
the only people, with one of these on the back?

05:45.664 --> 05:48.041
I meant... I did mean to ask, what is it?

05:48.125 --> 05:50.085
That means "novice".

05:50.919 --> 05:53.672
Everybody else has done at least six races.

05:54.339 --> 05:57.467
Worse still,
Richard had never been round Silverstone.

05:57.551 --> 06:00.178
The sum total of our experience is,
you've done?

06:00.262 --> 06:02.013
I've done a charity race in a Honda Civic.

06:02.097 --> 06:04.474
- And you've done five laps...
- Five laps in this.

06:04.516 --> 06:07.978
And you've done no racing at all.
You've done some laps, but not in this.

06:08.061 --> 06:12.983
I've done a race in a 2CV, I've never driven this
and I've never, ever been round Silver...

06:13.024 --> 06:14.818
We're not in good shape.

06:14.860 --> 06:18.488
A walk down the pits
didn't exactly cheer us up, either.

06:20.740 --> 06:22.492
- We haven't got that.
- No, we haven't.

06:22.576 --> 06:25.036
- We haven't got this.
- We haven't got that.

06:25.078 --> 06:27.414
- We haven't got these.
- Is this a diesel?

06:27.497 --> 06:30.125
- No.
- What is it, an M3?

06:30.208 --> 06:33.962
- So this is an M3 BMW with a...
- It's a lot better than ours.

06:34.045 --> 06:37.340
- Is it a diesel?
- No, no. It's a bit quicker than an M3.

06:37.382 --> 06:40.010
- Please be nice to us.
- No.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.219
How can we get out of it?

06:41.303 --> 06:44.848
I'm seriously thinking of sitting down
before the race and drinking a bottle of vodka.

06:45.682 --> 06:48.310
Soon, though, it was time for qualifying.

06:49.394 --> 06:52.606
What if I have to get out of somebody's way
to let them go by?

06:52.689 --> 06:54.649
I don't know.

06:56.276 --> 06:58.111
I don't know.

06:58.195 --> 07:02.115
This is, without any question or shadow
of doubt, the scariest thing I've ever done.

07:02.199 --> 07:04.159
- Yes.
- I've broken me zip.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.037
That's bad?

07:12.501 --> 07:16.046
For qualifying, we had to do
a minimum of three laps each,

07:16.129 --> 07:21.301
and the quickest time from our team
would decide our place on the starting grid.

07:21.384 --> 07:24.262
I went first.

07:29.101 --> 07:32.938
Flat through Bridge.
Don't lift, don't lift, don't lift, don't lift.

07:35.273 --> 07:37.567
I've got another M3 coming up behind me.

07:38.568 --> 07:42.239
He's ruining my bloody lap.
What an absolute (bleep)!

07:42.322 --> 07:44.574
He ruined my lap. The lap's gone.

07:44.616 --> 07:47.452
Maybe Captain Slow would have better luck.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.999
Oh, my God. 911s everywhere.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.002
Don't be intimidated. Just keep going.

07:56.962 --> 07:59.423
May was back astonishingly quickly.

07:59.464 --> 08:02.259
In fact, too quickly.

08:02.342 --> 08:04.803
James, did you do three laps?

08:04.886 --> 08:07.514
- Two.
- Well, you haven't done a fast lap.

08:07.597 --> 08:09.683
- I just did a fast lap.
- No, you can't do it in two.

08:09.766 --> 08:11.726
- I'm sure I did.
- You didn't.

08:11.810 --> 08:15.188
- All right.
- How could you not count?

08:16.273 --> 08:19.609
Hammond, meanwhile,
had no idea where he was going.

08:19.693 --> 08:22.446
This is Maggotts. Or Becketts.

08:22.529 --> 08:25.574
Or Vale. Or Chapel.

08:25.657 --> 08:29.161
We'd planned to leave Richard out there
so he could learn the track,

08:29.244 --> 08:32.956
but now we had to get him in
so James could go back out.

08:33.999 --> 08:38.919
As cock-ups go, I've watched formula One since
I was that high and I've never seen anybody...

08:39.004 --> 08:41.089
- Forget to do a flying lap.
...forget a flying lap.

08:42.841 --> 08:45.969
Qualifying was turning into a shambles.

08:46.052 --> 08:49.973
And when we tuned into the circuit TV,
that went wrong, as well.

08:50.015 --> 08:53.018
A chest of drawers and a table!

08:53.101 --> 08:57.397
We were a laughing stock,
but we still had an ace up our sleeves...

08:57.481 --> 08:59.357
...our fourth driver.

09:03.361 --> 09:05.947
Yeah, they weren't ready for thatl

09:08.283 --> 09:10.035
Can it do 24 hours straight?

09:12.537 --> 09:16.792
With The Stig at the wheel,
we were in business.

09:21.088 --> 09:24.508
- 2.24.
- We're not bottom!

09:24.549 --> 09:27.177
Boston Bowl, let's go down there and mock!

09:28.720 --> 09:30.597
Sadly, we couldn't.

09:30.680 --> 09:37.229
Because this was a 24-hour race,
we also had to do three practice laps at night.

09:42.609 --> 09:45.320
- My fear's come back badly.
- My fear's come back hideously.

09:45.403 --> 09:49.032
It's looking at you
that's making me more scared.

09:49.116 --> 09:52.786
(Richard) I went first,
and it turned out my fears were justified.

09:55.872 --> 09:58.875
People are trying to get round me,
there's lights everywhere.

09:58.917 --> 10:02.212
Jeez! I don't remember anything.

10:02.254 --> 10:04.381
This really is all you can see.

10:04.464 --> 10:08.260
You have to aim for corners
and just sort of hope they're still there.

10:08.343 --> 10:09.845
It's terrifying.

10:09.928 --> 10:13.014
I've got nobody to follow. Oh, God!

10:15.725 --> 10:17.436
Then it was Jeremy's turn.

10:19.729 --> 10:21.231
Holy cow, I can't see a thing!

10:21.314 --> 10:24.401
He tried to cure the lack of visibility
with speed.

10:24.443 --> 10:27.487
I just took Bridge Corner flat, first time out.

10:27.571 --> 10:29.531
Oh (bleep), I'm off!

10:31.116 --> 10:34.119
People behind must be thinking,
"Who is this clown?"

10:35.829 --> 10:39.958
Amazingly, The Stig went faster at night
than he had in the day,

10:40.041 --> 10:43.295
and put us in an astonishing 42nd on the grid.

10:44.838 --> 10:47.007
- Yeah!
- The great!

10:47.090 --> 10:48.884
Yeah! Don't touch him.

10:52.804 --> 10:56.933
With James' qualifying in the bag,
everything looked good for the race.

10:57.017 --> 10:58.685
But then...

10:58.769 --> 11:01.271
James, this is Richard.
What's happened? Tell us.

11:01.354 --> 11:05.192
Throttle went mad, gearbox seemed to explode,
everything. Hang on, I'm coming in.

11:06.818 --> 11:10.572
We now had a good starting spot on the grid
but nothing to start with.

11:10.655 --> 11:15.243
0ur L11,000 repmobile was in serious trouble.

11:17.788 --> 11:20.791
That's made a mess of them.

11:20.874 --> 11:26.421
0ur race chief reckoned we'd blown the turbo,
the clutch and the flywheel.

11:26.505 --> 11:30.759
But we never quit.
Top Gear Technology Centre, innit?

11:30.842 --> 11:35.972
While Steve set about the car,
we set about our high energy supper.

11:36.056 --> 11:40.644
- I'm not worried that it's not going to be fixed.
- Perhaps he won't fix it.

11:40.727 --> 11:46.316
The only worry I have is that if Steve
has to work through the night tonight to fix it,

11:46.358 --> 11:48.985
when we do the race tomorrow,
he has to work through tomorrow night.

11:49.069 --> 11:51.196
- That's a three day...
- Yeah.

11:52.823 --> 11:55.033
I'm not bothered about that either,
now I think of it.

12:00.664 --> 12:03.834
So to summarize, the car was broken,

12:03.917 --> 12:07.003
we were all rubbish, James' zip was stuck

12:07.087 --> 12:10.048
and we'd accidentally written
"Arse Biscuits" on the driver's door.

12:10.715 --> 12:12.342
Kind of par for the course with Top Gear.

12:12.426 --> 12:17.764
We just expected the race to be the usual affair,
everything would catch fire and we'd all drown.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.433
We were quite looking forward to it,

12:19.516 --> 12:22.310
and then we went to visit the team
that qualified last.

12:22.394 --> 12:24.187
- To laugh at.
- Yeah.

12:24.229 --> 12:27.190
But they told us that they qualified last
the year before, as well.

12:27.232 --> 12:29.943
But by being consistent
and not making any mistakes,

12:30.026 --> 12:32.988
their Golf diesel finished 13th overall.

12:33.071 --> 12:36.783
They'd beaten M3s, 911s and even the odd Viper.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.326
Yeah, and this gave us an idea.

12:38.410 --> 12:41.830
We thought, if we take this seriously,

12:41.913 --> 12:46.668
maybe our BMW diesel
could finish in the top ten.

12:46.752 --> 12:48.795
We'll see how that pans out later on.

12:48.879 --> 12:51.631
But now it's time for the news,
and there isn't any.

12:51.715 --> 12:54.926
Even if there were, we haven't got time for it,
because we've got a packed program.

12:55.010 --> 12:57.679
So we must move on, to the 1950s. James.

12:57.763 --> 12:59.598
- (Gasps)
- (Laughter)

13:00.724 --> 13:03.059
Over the past few years,
many car manufacturers

13:03.143 --> 13:06.605
have been reinventing their old models
from the past.

13:06.646 --> 13:08.315
- Where you live.
- Thank you.

13:08.398 --> 13:10.817
Volkswagen has given us the new Beetle.

13:10.901 --> 13:13.028
BMW, of course, reinvented the Mini.

13:13.111 --> 13:14.988
And now there's another one.

13:19.159 --> 13:22.871
And here it is. It's called the Fiat 500,

13:22.954 --> 13:26.500
and it's virtually a carbon copy
of their legendary car from the '50s,

13:26.583 --> 13:29.544
which was called, erm... the Fiat 500.

13:31.254 --> 13:35.050
Now, the original car
was small and ruthlessly simple.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.844
You could even buy spares
from your local newsagent's.

13:37.928 --> 13:42.808
It was the last word
in cheap utilitarian transport for the masses.

13:46.686 --> 13:48.313
Now, let me say straight from the off,

13:48.396 --> 13:53.318
that this is not small,
cheap, utilitarian transport for the masses.

13:53.860 --> 13:59.324
Under this retro body,
it's based on the current Fiat Panda.

13:59.366 --> 14:01.451
I don't wish to get all bah humbug about it,

14:01.535 --> 14:06.498
but the Panda is bigger, it's more practical
and it's about a grand cheaper.

14:06.581 --> 14:10.127
So with your beige trousers on,
that's the one you'd buy.

14:10.168 --> 14:12.337
But the Panda is just a car,

14:12.421 --> 14:15.841
whereas this is a car and a fashion item.

14:15.924 --> 14:20.345
And you'd have to say that on the style front,
Fiat's done rather a good job.

14:24.141 --> 14:27.269
I mean, everything in here
wasn't on the original 500.

14:27.352 --> 14:32.691
It's got automatic air conditioning and electric
windows and buttons on the steering wheel.

14:32.732 --> 14:38.196
But the feel of it, this pseudo-metal dash and
these buttons and the big single instrument...

14:38.238 --> 14:40.949
- It even has...
- (Parps)

14:41.032 --> 14:42.367
...a retro horn.

14:43.326 --> 14:47.330
Prices start at L8,000, which means
that although it is dearer than a Panda,

14:47.414 --> 14:51.293
it's a good three grand less
than the cheapest Mini.

14:51.376 --> 14:54.337
And although it's about six inches
shorter than a Mini,

14:54.379 --> 14:56.423
it's actually more spacious inside.

14:58.091 --> 15:03.180
But the thing about the Mini
is that under its retro skin it drives brilliantly.

15:04.222 --> 15:08.560
So the question now is,
has Fiat pulled off the same trick?

15:12.647 --> 15:15.066
Well, its home turf will be the city,

15:15.150 --> 15:19.529
so we've brought it to one,
Budapest in Hungary.

15:19.571 --> 15:21.865
I've come here because a couple of years ago

15:21.948 --> 15:27.162
I raced some parkour jumpers through Liverpool
in a Peugot 207, and lost.

15:27.245 --> 15:29.539
And now some blokes
have been in touch and said,

15:29.581 --> 15:31.833
"How do you fancy losing again?"

15:33.710 --> 15:37.756
The difference this time
is that they're not big, tough parkour jumpers.

15:37.839 --> 15:41.510
They're actually just scallywags on BMX bikes.

15:41.593 --> 15:46.139
These wasters just ride around aimlessly,
like those kids in the ET film.

15:46.223 --> 15:51.103
So to borrow the phrase of the ancient
philosopher Clarksonius, 4th century BC,

15:51.186 --> 15:52.896
how hard can it be?

15:55.565 --> 16:00.028
The race covers eight miles
and starts in the old part of the city, Buda.

16:00.112 --> 16:03.323
We go down the hill,
across the bridge into Pest,

16:03.406 --> 16:06.326
on to the edge of the city
and the giant industrial area,

16:06.409 --> 16:10.831
where we will finish in the biggest
bicycle factory of the Soviet era.

16:13.917 --> 16:17.504
Three, two, one, go!

16:20.924 --> 16:22.467
Now we're off.

16:24.761 --> 16:26.721
(Chuckles)

16:29.724 --> 16:31.560
I've lost sight of them already.

16:33.103 --> 16:34.980
(Tires squeal)

16:38.275 --> 16:40.610
They're not going to last long
doing that sort of thing.

16:42.612 --> 16:46.700
0n the hairpins down the hill,
the handling was classic Italian town car.

16:47.826 --> 16:50.328
Quite a bit of body roll, but it's fine.

16:51.288 --> 16:53.248
Just adds to the amusement value.

17:00.922 --> 17:03.341
Leaving the old town,
heading towards the bridge,

17:03.383 --> 17:06.344
and the BMX bandits
were struggling to keep up.

17:09.973 --> 17:10.932
Bloody hell.

17:11.016 --> 17:13.143
But the bandits are made of stern stuff.

17:14.478 --> 17:17.355
And on the snarled up bridge, I lost my lead.

17:18.815 --> 17:20.108
But only for a moment.

17:20.192 --> 17:23.987
Right, this is a crucial overtaking opportunity.
I know what I can do here.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.070
Ha ha!

17:25.155 --> 17:28.282
Then we hit red lights,
which I couldn't get round.

17:28.366 --> 17:29.326
No!

17:29.367 --> 17:31.912
But they could.

17:40.170 --> 17:41.671
Oh, come on.

17:47.677 --> 17:50.764
Since I was losing, I got back to road testing.

17:50.847 --> 17:54.893
You can have this car
with 1.2 or 1.4 liter petrol engines,

17:54.976 --> 17:58.188
or you can have the engine I have here,
which is the diesel,

17:58.271 --> 17:59.856
which is rubbish.

18:02.776 --> 18:07.322
The whole point of a small Fiat is that you have
a very small engine in it, powered by petrol.

18:07.405 --> 18:11.952
You rev it and rev it and rev it until the valves
come out and dance on top of the bonnet,

18:12.035 --> 18:13.745
and then you change gear.

18:15.372 --> 18:17.916
I'd lost all sight of the bandits.

18:17.999 --> 18:20.127
Yet again, they'd gone to ground.

18:37.686 --> 18:40.730
Something I really like here
is the rev counter in the speedometer.

18:40.814 --> 18:46.153
One is inside the other, so the speed chases
the revs up and down the dial. It's terrific.

18:48.029 --> 18:52.868
0n the edge of town, still close,
we enter the great Soviet industrial park,

18:52.951 --> 18:55.245
for the final stage in the race.

18:56.288 --> 18:58.415
Bicycles...

18:59.166 --> 19:01.251
Yaah!

19:02.753 --> 19:04.921
Oh, crikey!

19:07.299 --> 19:08.675
Come on, diesel!

19:16.933 --> 19:19.728
Where the hell are those people?

19:24.316 --> 19:26.359
There they are.

19:27.235 --> 19:29.154
I can see 'em in the mirror.

19:29.696 --> 19:33.825
But watch this. If I'm very skillful here,
I can box them in a bit.

19:33.909 --> 19:35.619
There you are, parked on a lorry.

19:37.329 --> 19:40.207
- (Hungarian voice)
- What?

19:44.002 --> 19:45.754
No!

19:47.005 --> 19:48.799
Dah!

19:48.840 --> 19:50.092
I can see the flag.

19:50.175 --> 19:52.469
Oh, no, I can see them.

19:56.014 --> 19:57.682
No!

19:57.766 --> 19:59.184
Oh, (bleep)!

19:59.267 --> 20:01.728
In Hungarian.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.402
- You lost.
- Congratulations. Well done.

20:09.486 --> 20:11.947
Now go and get a proper bike.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.282
- You get a proper car.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:57.576 --> 29:00.121
Now, bad news.

29:00.204 --> 29:03.374
Jeremy was summoned
to the producer's office this week

29:03.457 --> 29:07.878
and told no more supercars on our test track
for this series.

29:07.962 --> 29:09.922
- (All) Aaw!
- I know. He was most insistent.

29:10.005 --> 29:15.052
He said we'd had too many and it was time
Jeremy went and reviewed a proper family car.

29:15.136 --> 29:17.096
So, here we go.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.685
This is a Daihatsu Materia.

29:22.768 --> 29:27.314
It's a small and easy to park
five-door hatchback.

29:29.233 --> 29:32.069
Now, what I thought I'd do
is compare it to a rival,

29:32.153 --> 29:35.072
a competitor product of some sort.

29:35.156 --> 29:36.824
The producer liked that idea very much,

29:36.907 --> 29:39.618
so what I've done is brought along this.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.212
It's the Ascari A10,

29:50.296 --> 29:56.302
a carbon fiber powerhouse with a five-liter V8
from an old BMWM5 in the back.

29:59.680 --> 30:02.600
I think it's better-looking
than the Daihatsu.

30:05.019 --> 30:10.608
And with 625 horsepower on tap,
it's also much louder.

30:11.358 --> 30:13.319
Quicker, too.

30:14.570 --> 30:17.907
In fact, it's quicker than almost anything.

30:19.325 --> 30:22.411
It is insanely fast.

30:24.455 --> 30:28.375
Put your foot down
and instantly you're somewhere else,

30:28.459 --> 30:31.629
very, very far away from where you were.

30:32.671 --> 30:36.425
Naught to sixty takes 2.8 seconds.

30:38.552 --> 30:42.640
Flat out, you'll be doing 215 mph,

30:42.723 --> 30:47.770
and sign language for the rest of your life
because you'll be deaf.

30:47.853 --> 30:49.939
(Engine roars)

30:49.980 --> 30:51.607
(Silence)

30:51.649 --> 30:53.025
(Engine snarls)

31:09.625 --> 31:14.422
0f course, you might imagine that because
it was conceived by a Dutch billionaire

31:14.505 --> 31:17.800
and built on an industrial estate in Banbury,

31:17.842 --> 31:20.261
that it's all a bit half-cocked.

31:22.346 --> 31:28.602
And sure, the interior is as luxurious
and as well finished as an army Land Rover.

31:29.395 --> 31:33.232
But the way this thing drives beggars belief.

31:42.366 --> 31:45.745
It's funny, because it's not a heavy car, this.

31:45.828 --> 31:49.206
It doesn't weigh much more
than a family hatchback,

31:49.290 --> 31:53.127
but it feels like it's running on coal.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.671
It feels like it's from
the Industrial Revolution.

31:58.007 --> 32:02.845
It feels like I should really be sitting here
with a dirty face and a Davy lamp.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.643
I just love this sequential gearbox.

32:09.727 --> 32:14.356
It's as manly as Lawrence Dallaglio's jockstrap.

32:21.447 --> 32:23.240
And then there's the steering,

32:23.324 --> 32:25.284
which is even better.

32:25.367 --> 32:29.205
Because it's so good
and so perfectly weighted...

32:30.706 --> 32:35.252
you have the confidence to take this car
by the wedding veg,

32:36.879 --> 32:40.382
and go absolutely berserk.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.057
Whoa!

32:54.313 --> 32:59.735
It's a staggering car, this, like a Koenigsegg,
only a million times more manageable.

33:03.614 --> 33:06.951
But how does it compare
to the Daihatsu Materia?

33:09.328 --> 33:12.998
Well, in a number of crucial areas, not well.

33:13.916 --> 33:17.837
The Daihatsu has a CD autochanger, an airbag,

33:17.920 --> 33:20.506
five seats and a big boot.

33:21.549 --> 33:24.051
The Ascari has none of these things.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.762
You can't even understand the dashboard.

33:29.473 --> 33:35.020
What's more, the Daihatsu
is L339,000 cheaper than the A10,

33:35.104 --> 33:37.189
and much more economical.

33:40.067 --> 33:42.736
And then there's the cornering.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.909
It's a cold November day, but trust me,

33:48.993 --> 33:51.203
I'm sweating in here now.

33:53.414 --> 33:55.916
No anti-lock brakes.

33:56.751 --> 33:58.294
No traction control.

33:58.377 --> 34:02.339
The only thing keeping this
pointing in the right direction is me.

34:04.842 --> 34:05.843
Whoops.

34:10.306 --> 34:15.478
Now look at this. Note how the Daihatsu gets
round the same corner without crashing once.

34:16.353 --> 34:20.315
And what's more,
in a straight line at 85 miles an hour

34:20.399 --> 34:23.777
it'll easily overtake the Ascari
when it's doing 70.

34:25.862 --> 34:28.699
Choosing between these two, then,
is not easy.

34:28.783 --> 34:30.826
Certainly the Daihatsu is very good,

34:30.868 --> 34:36.623
but I think, on balance,
I'd choose the big yellow shouty car instead.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.676
- Ahem!
- What?

34:49.344 --> 34:51.514
You were supposed to test a family car.

34:51.597 --> 34:53.264
- I did.
- Yes, and look at this chart.

34:53.349 --> 34:57.228
OK, the Daihatsu is considerably cheaper.
Its insurance group 8, not 20.

34:57.311 --> 35:02.024
46 miles per gallon, not 9 miles per gallon.
More doors, more seats.

35:02.108 --> 35:07.071
Look at this, the Ascari,
it doesn't even have inertia reel seat belts.

35:07.154 --> 35:10.783
I hear what you say,
but the Ascari is much faster.

35:10.866 --> 35:13.661
And now we're going to find out
exactly how fast,

35:13.744 --> 35:16.497
by handing it over to our tame racing driver.

35:16.580 --> 35:21.377
Some say that he once lost a canoe
on a beach in the northeast,

35:23.087 --> 35:26.966
and that he once did some time
in a prison in Canterbury,

35:27.049 --> 35:30.386
because his teddy is called the Baby Jesus.

35:30.469 --> 35:31.762
(Laughter)

35:31.846 --> 35:34.348
All we know is, he's called The Stig.

35:35.683 --> 35:39.687
And he's off. Nice clean start there.
But listen to that noisel

35:39.770 --> 35:44.024
It's like Victorian Manchester
is trying to escape from the exhaust.

35:44.108 --> 35:47.695
0K, now, unleashing Brunelian fury
through there.

35:48.446 --> 35:52.366
Looking remarkably tidy.
Mild drift, maybe, at the end.

35:52.450 --> 35:56.579
0oh, now, no Stig audio nonsense this week,
cos the Ascari has no stereo.

35:56.620 --> 36:02.001
Anyway, you wouldn't hear it over the sound
of men in stovepipe hats furiously smelting.

36:02.084 --> 36:05.254
Hammerhead.
This catches out some mid-engine cars.

36:05.296 --> 36:07.798
But not this one. Look at that.

36:07.882 --> 36:11.051
Now, van Telford's supersonic
steam train is offl

36:13.304 --> 36:16.307
Right, now, a chance to really open up
that BMW engine.

36:16.390 --> 36:20.811
Well, I say BMW. Actually, it feels
more like it was made by James Watt.

36:20.895 --> 36:22.688
That is fastl

36:22.772 --> 36:26.233
0K, now, two corners left.
This could be a seriously good time.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.402
Just look how controlled it is through there.

36:29.069 --> 36:32.156
Now, coming through Gambon.
Again, controlled.

36:32.239 --> 36:34.200
And across the line.

36:35.451 --> 36:36.702
Now...

36:37.870 --> 36:43.334
Now because this has a hydraulic lifting nose,
which we can see here,

36:43.375 --> 36:46.128
it is able to get over speed bumps.

36:46.170 --> 36:49.965
And that means it is a road car,
and that means it can go on our board.

36:50.007 --> 36:54.386
But can it beat the Koenigsegg,
which is a 1.17.6?

36:54.470 --> 37:00.810
Well, this did it in 1.17.3.

37:00.851 --> 37:04.647
It's the new lap record holder,

37:04.730 --> 37:08.192
the fastest car ever to go round our track.

37:09.527 --> 37:13.656
Now, earlier on,
we entered a 24-hour race at Silverstone,

37:13.739 --> 37:17.785
and thanks to The Stig,
we qualified 42nd out of 59 starters.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.245
But there were a few problems.

37:19.328 --> 37:23.082
We had no racing experience,
I'd never even driven round Silverstone

37:23.165 --> 37:28.546
and we were using a secondhand diesel BMW
that we'd turned into a racing car ourselves.

37:28.587 --> 37:32.591
And at the end of the qualifying session,
it was all badly broken.

37:32.675 --> 37:36.554
Still, we were confident that it would be fixed
and ready for the off.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.349
(Jeremy) So, race day.

37:40.391 --> 37:45.187
The crowds were flocking in and we were
summoned to the drivers' briefing.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.273
...supervised and then you will be released.

37:47.356 --> 37:50.693
The Stig, however, found this a bit dreary.

37:50.776 --> 37:54.739
...on the way to the penalty box
or leaving the penalty box.

37:54.822 --> 38:00.035
Neither can you stop in the refueling area
on your way to the penalty box.

38:00.077 --> 38:02.705
If you need to go to your pit
or you need to go and refuel...

38:07.418 --> 38:10.212
Afterwards, there was a half hour
shake-down session.

38:10.254 --> 38:14.175
And we hoped that after a whole night
in the workshop our car would be fixed,

38:14.258 --> 38:17.052
so Hammond could get out there
and learn the track.

38:18.095 --> 38:19.597
But it was not to be.

38:19.680 --> 38:24.351
We've just discovered,
having replaced the turbo, the inlet manifold,

38:24.435 --> 38:28.731
the clutch and the flywheel, all last night,
that now there's diesel in the sump.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.775
Which is what, a pump or the injectors?

38:30.858 --> 38:33.319
We don't know yet.

38:35.029 --> 38:40.076
It turned out to be the fuel pump,
which was a bit embarrassing for us three.

38:40.159 --> 38:45.831
What they're saying is, our farm-fresh, morning
dew diesel has got too much methanol in it,

38:45.915 --> 38:49.460
which is eating the fuel seals
and fuel's getting out.

38:51.837 --> 38:54.256
So, how long's it going to take
to fix the fuel pump?

38:54.340 --> 38:56.967
In theory, to do the job in the workshop,
it's a six hour job.

38:57.051 --> 39:00.638
- So...
- Six hours takes us till... We miss the race.

39:00.721 --> 39:04.308
We've got some guys picking up some special
tools. We'll probably do it in two and a half.

39:04.391 --> 39:06.477
- Well, where are they?
- Milton Keynes.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.396
- We haven't gone to pick them up?
- There's a man on the way there now.

39:09.480 --> 39:13.567
You're talking about it's impossible to have
this car running until quarter past three.

39:13.651 --> 39:18.155
- We have to be on the grid at five to four.
- Five to four.

39:18.239 --> 39:21.242
- If we're not, we start from the pit lane.
- Yeah.

40:35.945 --> 40:41.409
With two hours to go, the other teams
were pretty much ready. Us, however?

40:41.492 --> 40:45.747
Whatever you do,
don't go downstairs and look at the car.

40:46.539 --> 40:52.295
It's got no front end, no lights, no radiator,
no bumper, no splitter,

40:52.378 --> 40:54.589
no front of the engine, no bonnet.

40:54.672 --> 40:59.344
That fuel pump thing is right in the bowels
of the thing. They've got the whole front off.

40:59.385 --> 41:03.264
It's like trying to repair something in France
from this end of the Channel Tunnel.

41:03.348 --> 41:06.684
James will be exaggerating...
James isn't exaggerating.

41:08.061 --> 41:09.812
And it's leaking.

41:09.896 --> 41:13.066
I watch Formula One a lot and I've never,
in the whole time I've watched it,

41:13.149 --> 41:18.196
seen a Formula One car two hours before a race
looking like that.

41:24.619 --> 41:27.580
With an hour to go, finally, some good news.

41:27.622 --> 41:31.376
Excellent! The fuel pump is on.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.419
Watch this. Ready?

41:34.212 --> 41:36.923
Pop it in, and away he goes.

41:37.006 --> 41:40.009
- Now he'll have the engine fixed in no time.
- Easy now.

41:40.093 --> 41:42.929
I don't want that back, thanks, Steve.
You keep it.

41:43.429 --> 41:45.890
We were cheering up.

41:45.932 --> 41:50.311
But honestly, our secondhand repmobile
was beginning to look like classic Top Gear.

41:50.395 --> 41:53.439
Ambitious, but rubbish.

41:56.276 --> 41:58.319
And so it turned out to be.

41:58.403 --> 42:02.365
Steve's team had done
the fastest rebuild in history,

42:02.448 --> 42:04.659
but it wasn't fast enough.

42:09.747 --> 42:14.752
As the other cars lined up on the grid,
ours was still in the garage.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.796
We missed it. We never made it.

42:20.216 --> 42:22.302
Now we'd have to start from the back,

42:22.385 --> 42:27.432
and if we couldn't get it started in 30 minutes,
we wouldn't be starting at all.

42:35.064 --> 42:40.153
With just 20 minutes to go, our super-green
eco-car finally coughed into life.

42:40.653 --> 42:42.780
Nobody's going to overtake us
with this coming out the back.

42:42.822 --> 42:43.948
But then...

42:43.990 --> 42:47.327
It's only running on five cylinders.
Injector six isn't working.

42:47.410 --> 42:49.579
It could be a simple fix. It might be horrible.

42:56.294 --> 42:58.338
- So, how long have we got?
- Three minutes.

43:06.763 --> 43:08.556
They're on their parade lap.

43:09.515 --> 43:13.311
When they came back round again, the flag
would drop and the race would start.

43:13.394 --> 43:15.980
We had just over two minutes.

43:20.944 --> 43:23.071
They're going to be back.

43:23.154 --> 43:25.823
Stig's in. Stig's getting in. Stig's getting in.

43:34.624 --> 43:39.212
The Stig had to be at the end of the pit lane
before the last car crossed the line.

43:39.295 --> 43:42.507
I have never felt tension like it.

43:43.049 --> 43:45.093
Come on, come on, come on!
They're past Stowe.

43:47.762 --> 43:49.722
(Bleep) That's them.

44:04.070 --> 44:07.448
- He's done it!
- That's it, we're in the race!

44:09.242 --> 44:10.868
I cannot believe that.

44:10.910 --> 44:14.289
- Bearing in mind, no test on that car at all...
- No.

44:14.372 --> 44:16.708
...it's out there now for 24 hours.
- Yep.

44:16.749 --> 44:20.003
It looked a bit smoky,
but it had The Stig at the wheel,

44:20.086 --> 44:23.214
and this is what he does best.

44:31.222 --> 44:36.811
Type Rs, Porsches, M3s,
despite his diesel engine, he had the lotl

44:38.396 --> 44:41.566
Have you seen his time?
He's just done a 2.17.

44:41.608 --> 44:43.735
- No, I'm sorry, 2.16!
- Whoa!

44:43.776 --> 44:45.987
He's just taken another second off it.

44:48.114 --> 44:50.617
Look how many people he's faster
than already.

44:50.700 --> 44:53.036
Every single one he's faster than.

44:56.789 --> 45:01.419
Stig is now 13 seconds a lap
quicker than the next diesel.

45:02.503 --> 45:06.924
Having started in 59th place,

45:06.966 --> 45:10.637
we are now in 39th place.

45:10.720 --> 45:15.099
- So he's made up 20 places in...
- One hour and twenty minutes.

45:15.141 --> 45:17.602
But my worry now
is that we're going too hard on it.

45:21.397 --> 45:24.776
0ver the next 20 minutes,
The Stig climbed another two places,

45:24.817 --> 45:28.112
but then James's negative waves hit home.

45:28.196 --> 45:30.365
And hit hard.

45:30.448 --> 45:32.408
(Explosion)

45:36.496 --> 45:37.830
That's not a good sign.

45:42.919 --> 45:44.420
Did it fill with smoke?

45:45.463 --> 45:48.925
- Did it lose power?
- You're wasting your breath.

45:49.008 --> 45:52.428
It would help if we could talk to the driver
and find out what actually happened.

45:52.512 --> 45:56.557
But it's just stopped working,
like a TV on standby.

45:56.641 --> 46:01.980
We needed a tiny piece for the fuel injection
system and, predictably, we didn't have it.

46:02.063 --> 46:05.733
But mysteriously, ten minutes later, we didl

46:05.817 --> 46:09.654
This is it. Somebody in the car park's
going home on five cylinders.

46:12.490 --> 46:14.951
The breakdown had cost us half an hour.

46:15.034 --> 46:17.245
Because The Stig had got out of the car,

46:17.328 --> 46:22.292
the rules said he couldn't get back in again
until someone else had had a go.

46:22.375 --> 46:25.920
That meant he'd only done
half his three-hour stint.

46:26.004 --> 46:28.548
We've lost an hour and a half
of Stig racing time.

46:28.631 --> 46:31.301
Yeah, I agree, that's a shame.
But let's get on with it.

46:32.844 --> 46:36.347
The Christian motorist
was now in the hot seat.

46:36.431 --> 46:39.183
Absolutely everything going past,

46:39.225 --> 46:41.519
but never mind.

46:41.561 --> 46:44.689
- Really desperate for a wee now.
- Oh, man, I'm struggling.

46:44.772 --> 46:46.899
I didn't know
it would take you this long to get round.

46:48.568 --> 46:50.862
Thank you. Doing my best.

46:52.405 --> 46:54.324
2.30's not bad.

46:54.407 --> 46:57.952
- Come on, that's what the Golf guys...
- You're a nice guy.

46:58.036 --> 47:02.206
A few minutes later, though,
something amazing happened.

47:02.915 --> 47:05.418
I've overtaken someone!

47:05.501 --> 47:09.505
I don't want you to get all daft and giddy, OK?
You just did a 2.24.

47:09.589 --> 47:11.424
I'm (bleep) loving this.

47:11.507 --> 47:16.137
(Richard) Things were going well.
James wasn't quite as slow as expected,

47:16.220 --> 47:20.850
and unlike the petrol cars, which needed
a five-minute fuel stop every hour,

47:20.933 --> 47:23.519
our tank would last three times that.

47:30.985 --> 47:37.075
As night began to fall, the sheer effort required
for endurance racing began to tell.

47:42.288 --> 47:46.084
James was tired out, too.
His lap times were tumbling.

47:49.587 --> 47:52.799
Normally, I'd be on the phone to him now,
being fatuous and stupid,

47:52.882 --> 47:55.677
telling him he's Captain Slow
and he's got to hurry up.

47:55.760 --> 48:01.224
The last thing you want is anyone clowning
around on your headphones, on your radio.

48:01.307 --> 48:05.520
There's so much to think about. You know,
where's the corner? Where's the other car?

48:05.603 --> 48:07.605
What gear should I be in?
When do I brake?

48:07.689 --> 48:10.024
I can't think about being a TV presenter.

48:10.108 --> 48:13.820
90 minutes into his stint,
the inevitable happened.

48:14.487 --> 48:15.989
(Crash)

48:16.030 --> 48:17.991
Bollocks! Sorry, I'm off.

48:19.075 --> 48:23.788
Even though the car was good for
another 90 minutes, we had to rest James.

48:24.789 --> 48:26.916
How slippery are new tires?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.294
Bleeding awful. Honestly.

48:30.962 --> 48:33.047
Good luck, mate.

48:33.131 --> 48:35.466
Please, God, don't let me mess this up.

48:39.762 --> 48:45.935
My nerves calmed as I realized that Steve,
builder's crack or not, knew what he was doing.

48:46.019 --> 48:48.605
Steve, you've built one hell of a car here.

48:49.480 --> 48:52.150
It's so utterly joyous and lovely to drive.

48:53.026 --> 48:55.153
And it's already got a personality now,

48:55.236 --> 49:00.158
just having made the start and...
Whoa! God, we're good on the brakes!

49:01.701 --> 49:06.331
It didn't have much straight line speed,
but through the corners it was astonishing.

49:06.372 --> 49:08.374
I even went on the offensive.

49:10.877 --> 49:14.172
I'm coming up behind those Italians
in the 1 series.

49:14.756 --> 49:17.800
Look at this. Neck and...
No, he's come across my nose!

49:17.884 --> 49:21.804
We saved you from the Germans
and that's what I get!

49:21.888 --> 49:23.598
Don't wreck the car.

49:24.641 --> 49:27.644
As the night wore on,
other cars were breaking down,

49:27.727 --> 49:29.729
but the little BMWpounded on.

49:31.898 --> 49:33.232
Thanks, mate.

49:33.316 --> 49:37.779
And when I finished my stint,
we were up to 37th place.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.118
What a truly fantastic way
of spending an evening.

49:44.202 --> 49:49.165
(Richard) As my first ever racing lap
of Silverstone would be in the dark,

49:49.248 --> 49:51.125
I couldn't say the same.

49:53.753 --> 49:55.380
No, that's Maggotts and Becketts.

49:55.463 --> 49:59.175
This is now opening down to Abbey.
No, to the bloody straight!

49:59.634 --> 50:01.386
Christ, you've got to concentrate.

50:01.469 --> 50:03.763
Still, even Jeremy was encouraging.

50:04.597 --> 50:08.893
Hammond, your speed is not only good
but it's consistent now, mate. Excellent.

50:08.977 --> 50:11.479
I settled down for the night shift.

50:29.622 --> 50:31.582
And then...

50:33.209 --> 50:35.169
Bollocks!

50:35.253 --> 50:37.714
Guys, I've binned it.

50:41.217 --> 50:43.136
Will it move under its own power?

50:43.803 --> 50:45.805
I'd say it was game over.

50:52.478 --> 50:55.481
Steve and his magicians can't get this fixed.

50:55.565 --> 50:59.235
I'm sorry, lads. I'm... I'm sorry.

51:01.029 --> 51:04.616
Have you found out yet, did I take
somebody else off? Could you find out?

51:04.699 --> 51:07.035
You did. It was a white Mosler.

51:07.744 --> 51:11.581
Oh, bloody hell. I couldn't hit
anything more expensive, could I?

51:12.081 --> 51:14.292
We've got to clear this (bleep).

51:18.087 --> 51:20.965
Right, everyone who's not involved, get back.

51:24.010 --> 51:27.138
The wishbone was broken,
the disc brake was ruined.

51:27.180 --> 51:30.016
Two wheels were smashed,
the left headlight was shattered,

51:30.099 --> 51:33.394
the door was caved in
and the engine wouldn't turn over.

51:33.519 --> 51:35.021
If the boys can mend it,

51:35.104 --> 51:39.484
and if the scrutineer says the car is safe
to go out again, you may use it again,

51:39.525 --> 51:42.320
so you're not out of the race yet.

51:42.362 --> 51:46.491
As the car was being fixed
we watched the onboard footage,

51:46.532 --> 51:49.786
to see how I'd managed to hit
a half million pound Mosler

51:49.869 --> 51:51.829
that was fighting for the lead.

51:51.871 --> 51:55.583
You thought there was only one car there,
cos there was just a blur of light.

51:55.667 --> 51:58.252
It goes through, you move over,
there's someone else there.

51:58.336 --> 52:03.758
It wasn't your fault. I thought I hit the 944
doing exactly the same thing on the straight.

52:07.053 --> 52:10.556
This is a shot I've just organized
of Richard Hammond after the crash.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.475
- Pan round.
- A portrait.

52:12.558 --> 52:14.811
Cheers.

52:14.894 --> 52:18.314
(James) It took nearly three hours
to get the car running again,

52:18.398 --> 52:22.360
by which time we were stone dead last.

52:22.402 --> 52:25.697
0nly one man could get us back in contention.

52:36.291 --> 52:38.042
The field was now spread out,

52:38.126 --> 52:41.754
but in the next three hours,
The Stig climbed eight places.

52:45.008 --> 52:47.468
Then, when it was my turn, the fog came.

52:50.430 --> 52:52.390
I was completely blind.

52:52.432 --> 52:54.434
(Bleep) Nora!

52:56.269 --> 52:59.397
(Jeremy) Because the visibility
had slowed James to a crawl,

52:59.439 --> 53:02.483
I thought I could get away with
some fog-based japery.

53:02.567 --> 53:05.403
James, it's Jeremy. Whoo hurghl

53:08.948 --> 53:11.909
The bad news is,
your joke's just had me straight off.

53:13.536 --> 53:17.999
(Richard) Eventually the fog became so thick,
the race was halted.

53:22.337 --> 53:26.382
And when it resumed,
we were in the gray light of a summer dawn,

53:26.466 --> 53:30.595
when the drivers are all a bit dopey,
as James demonstrated.

53:32.055 --> 53:36.559
It would probably be rude to point out to him
that he's pulled up in next door's pit.

53:37.644 --> 53:40.355
- This is the wrong pit.
- Never mind, it's close enough.

53:40.438 --> 53:43.816
Next door's pit
was home to the Saxondale team,

53:43.900 --> 53:46.778
who were using a diesel BMW like ours.

53:46.819 --> 53:50.239
After the calamities,
they were now our main rivals.

53:51.157 --> 53:54.243
As Jeremy geed up the capacity crowd...

53:54.327 --> 53:56.454
Do a Mexican wave.

53:58.665 --> 54:01.125
...The Stig made mincemeat of them.

54:04.170 --> 54:06.965
But then, 20 minutes later, disaster.

54:08.675 --> 54:12.637
The front splitter,
which helps with aerodynamics, had come off.

54:12.679 --> 54:14.430
Oh, (bleep)!

54:14.514 --> 54:16.766
And there was a monumental fuel leak.

54:18.810 --> 54:21.646
It was down on power.
He was five seconds a lap slow.

54:21.688 --> 54:24.274
Then the splitter fell off... that we put on.

54:25.900 --> 54:27.193
- Yeah.
- Don't tell James.

54:27.277 --> 54:29.904
Detachable. They do that. That's a feature.

54:29.988 --> 54:34.659
The Stig stayed at the wheel, so after the leak
was fixed, he could go out again.

54:34.742 --> 54:38.037
And even though the missing splitter
was ruining the handling,

54:38.121 --> 54:40.164
nothing was going to stop him.

54:40.248 --> 54:41.874
Nothing.

54:41.958 --> 54:46.421
Right now, at this very moment, computers
tell us that Stig is having a wee in the car.

54:46.504 --> 54:48.506
- (Laughter)
- And I'm next.

54:50.258 --> 54:53.177
(Jeremy) This speeded The Stig up even more.

54:57.098 --> 55:01.686
OK, it's now exactly 12 o'clock, as you can see.
Midday. Four and a half hours left to run.

55:01.769 --> 55:06.482
The Stig's work is done. He's got us into
third in class, we're the third fastest diesel,

55:06.566 --> 55:09.861
and now it's all up to Hammond, and then me.

55:11.237 --> 55:14.866
It should feel OK. The brakes have come off.
It's just sheared a bolt.

55:14.949 --> 55:16.200
Nice!

55:17.327 --> 55:20.580
(Richard) With the splitter coming off,
the fuel leak and now this,

55:20.663 --> 55:24.917
it was clear our little Trojan
was starting to fall apart.

55:28.087 --> 55:33.509
It was also down on power, and with no front
splitter, the handling wasn't great, either.

55:34.552 --> 55:37.388
The car doesn't feel as fast as it felt last night.

55:38.348 --> 55:40.934
Even I can tell something's wrong.

55:41.976 --> 55:45.063
Ooh, that Aston Martin
just span out in front of me.

55:45.146 --> 55:48.316
And having been up for 30 hours,
I nearly followed him.

55:48.399 --> 55:50.693
Concentrate. I'm losing my concentration.

55:50.777 --> 55:52.737
Where... Oh, bollocks.

55:58.117 --> 56:01.704
To wake myself up,
I organized a little present for Jeremy.

56:01.788 --> 56:03.790
I'm having a pee right now.

56:03.873 --> 56:06.334
Aah!

56:06.417 --> 56:09.754
(Jeremy) At the end of Richard's stint
we were still third in class,

56:09.837 --> 56:12.924
but I knew it would be hard to stay there.

56:13.341 --> 56:19.097
The problem is that the Saxondale one, that
silver 330, the one like ours, is 30 laps behind.

56:19.180 --> 56:22.433
We're going to lose five laps
at this next pit stop.

56:22.475 --> 56:26.312
They've got their quick driver in there,
against me.

56:26.396 --> 56:30.316
I'm telling you, in three hours' driving,
they're going to be right up my back bottom.

56:32.860 --> 56:35.405
So, this was it, the final stint.

56:36.739 --> 56:40.743
I was tired out, I was sitting in a puddle of wee,
the car was sick,

56:40.827 --> 56:44.205
and we had our main rivals bearing down on us.

56:47.583 --> 56:52.839
Please, car, please make it
to the end of this race, I beg of you.

56:55.508 --> 56:58.970
(Richard) To stay in third,
Jeremy had to drive fast.

56:59.012 --> 57:00.722
But there was a problem with that.

57:00.805 --> 57:04.225
Tires. He's got to do two hours
twenty minutes, yeah?

57:04.309 --> 57:08.271
I did that to these tires in two fifteen
and they're absolutely trashed.

57:08.354 --> 57:11.649
He's got to last two hours and twenty minutes
on the same tires.

57:11.691 --> 57:15.570
Jeremy, because there's no front splitter
there's no down force at the front,

57:15.653 --> 57:17.655
and it's tearing the tires to bits.

57:17.739 --> 57:20.325
So that we didn't need to waste time
with another pit stop,

57:20.366 --> 57:22.994
Jeremy had to preserve his tires.

57:23.077 --> 57:26.039
Unfortunately, though, this was Jeremy.

57:26.998 --> 57:28.750
Yeah!

57:28.833 --> 57:32.295
Please don't be cross with me
if that last lap was a bit quick.

57:32.378 --> 57:36.674
If he's just done a 24, those will not
last two hours, let alone two twenty.

57:36.758 --> 57:40.803
Just to let you know, at your present pace
you're going to be shredding those tires.

57:44.015 --> 57:48.019
Sadly, he was too busy racing Team Saxondale
to listen.

57:48.102 --> 57:49.854
And I've got him!

57:49.938 --> 57:52.565
Took him on the inside at Stowe.
I mean Copse.

57:52.649 --> 57:54.651
Jeremy, it's Richard. I know you're busy.

57:54.734 --> 57:57.111
Tell us about the tires. Do they feel OK?

57:59.238 --> 58:01.074
I've got Saxondale up my trumpet.

58:01.157 --> 58:02.825
I've got... Oh, missed a gear!

58:07.705 --> 58:10.291
Whoa! God!

58:10.375 --> 58:13.503
(Richard) Jeremy had destroyed the tires.

58:14.253 --> 58:17.465
Just heard from Steve.
We have our tire expert in the pit lane.

58:17.548 --> 58:21.886
He's looked at the other tires and says
yours will last about another three minutes.

58:21.970 --> 58:24.013
We had to get him in.

58:24.097 --> 58:28.476
Saxondale would rack up five laps
while our tires were changed.

58:30.395 --> 58:33.648
But on fresh rubber,
Jeremy could now get the hammer down.

58:46.661 --> 58:50.081
Lap update. Saxondale responding, 2.24.

58:50.123 --> 58:52.667
Get rubbing your rosaries, boys.

58:52.750 --> 58:54.335
Whoa, God!

58:54.419 --> 58:59.048
I just tried to take the track on the inside
of the corner and it went badly wrong.

58:59.132 --> 59:03.344
If you fall off in the last half hour of the race,
there's no recovery service.

59:03.428 --> 59:05.263
That's the end of your race.

59:10.977 --> 59:13.104
(Jeremy) Happily, we got some luck.

59:13.187 --> 59:15.231
The Saxondale team had hit problems,

59:15.315 --> 59:18.776
so now all I had to do
was nurse the car home.

59:20.153 --> 59:22.947
Come on, car. Please make it.

59:28.369 --> 59:31.623
This has been one of the best Top Gear
companions of the lot,

59:31.664 --> 59:36.461
a repmobile,
transformed in ten days into a racer.

59:39.088 --> 59:41.215
15 minutes to go.

59:42.842 --> 59:46.262
Starting to get a bit sloppy now.
We're getting a few mistakes.

59:48.181 --> 59:50.892
(Jeremy) Five minutes to go
and for the first time,

59:50.975 --> 59:54.020
and for the first time,
I felt this pee-stained David among Goliaths

59:54.103 --> 59:57.607
was actually going to finish, and finish well.

59:59.692 --> 01:00:04.238
It wants to make the finishing line.
I'm just willing it on.

01:00:09.118 --> 01:00:11.663
It's there!

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:19.003
Y-e-e-e-e-s!

01:00:20.463 --> 01:00:22.757
You brilliant little car!

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.218
God, this is just brilliant.

01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:30.473
It's absolutely epic.
