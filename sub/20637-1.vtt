01:52.879 --> 01:54.213
No!

01:55.949 --> 01:57.449
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

01:59.919 --> 02:05.324
<i>I know what day it is. But anniversary
or not, this year I refuse!</i>

02:05.326 --> 02:08.227
I'm not letting you out,
and I am not feeding you.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.829
And you must be quiet!

02:21.441 --> 02:27.412
<i>I know that you know, that my
granddaughter is in this house, visiting.</i>

02:28.848 --> 02:31.617
She's innocent like I was.

02:31.619 --> 02:35.354
And she's gonna stay that way, and there's
nothing, nothing, nothing you can do,

02:35.356 --> 02:38.857
because I will destroy you
before you touch her!

02:38.859 --> 02:41.160
Now, shut the fuck up!

02:42.929 --> 02:44.696
And you leave us alone.

03:10.457 --> 03:14.626
You can complain all you want.
You are never getting out!

03:40.987 --> 03:42.287
How is this possible?

03:52.832 --> 03:54.166
How did you?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.105
No! Oh, no. No, please!

04:01.040 --> 04:03.008
No, no!

04:03.010 --> 04:05.978
Yes! Yes! Oh!

04:08.182 --> 04:09.481
No!

04:21.961 --> 04:23.362
Yes!

04:23.364 --> 04:26.531
Oh, yes! I'm ready!

04:26.533 --> 04:28.033
No!

04:29.402 --> 04:30.602
Nana?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.638
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry!

04:32.640 --> 04:34.706
- What?
- Oh, this is all my fault!

04:34.708 --> 04:38.477
I should have known it was going to try
something when I wouldn't let it in.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.679
But it ends tonight!

04:42.382 --> 04:44.049
Put your clothes on.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.218
Nana?

04:57.430 --> 04:58.730
Shit!

05:02.468 --> 05:03.735
Nana?

05:05.738 --> 05:07.039
Nana?

05:10.510 --> 05:13.178
Do you remember this?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.013
Do you?

05:16.683 --> 05:18.216
Not dawn.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.688
No... not dawn.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.024
If you want somebody...
You take me.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.930
Nana, are you down here?

05:33.499 --> 05:34.633
No!

05:34.635 --> 05:37.669
Nana? What's happening?
What's wrong?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.738
Nana, I can't get the door open.
It's shut!

05:40.340 --> 05:41.673
No!

05:45.678 --> 05:46.945
Nana?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.409
Nana?

06:41.434 --> 06:42.667
No!

06:54.580 --> 06:55.914
No!

09:57.530 --> 10:00.865
Trust me,
you've made the right decision.

10:00.867 --> 10:05.470
You two will be so happy here!

10:05.472 --> 10:07.739
Can't believe we finally
got our own home!

10:07.741 --> 10:09.808
I told you we'd get there.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.643
I can't believe
it came fully furnished.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.279
Are you sure the previous
owners don't want any of it?

10:14.281 --> 10:17.382
No, it's all property
of miss black's.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.552
- Ever since she...
- Left.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.987
There's nobody around
to claim it.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.389
- Not even her family?
- No.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.292
No.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.428
Well, ever since the horrible incident
with their daughter in the basement,

10:30.430 --> 10:33.965
which would never
ever happen again, by the way,

10:33.967 --> 10:37.268
they want to have nothing to
do with it, so they... they...

10:37.270 --> 10:40.505
Decided to put the house up for sale
once the state allowed them to do so

10:40.507 --> 10:45.043
and told my agents
to get rid out it.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.580
- Seems odd.
- No, no!

10:48.582 --> 10:51.349
It's not uncommon when people
face this kind of family tragedy.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.486
But only because of
bad memories and stuff.

10:54.488 --> 10:58.623
Which is why we're playing it safe.
We're placing a furnace.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.758
You are very smart.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.362
Refer a friend!

11:14.473 --> 11:17.942
How about we christen the couch
first, before my back goes out?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.811
Stop it, put me down!

11:32.958 --> 11:34.392
How about...

11:35.494 --> 11:37.529
We start in the kitchen?

11:37.531 --> 11:41.066
Well, to be fair to the entire house,
I think it should be included.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.869
It's a lot of rooms. You sure
you gonna be up for that?

11:44.871 --> 11:47.205
As long it's with you, I'm sure
I'll rise to the occasion.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.307
Oh, that's such a bad pun.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.810
You want a quick word
or hot sex?

11:56.248 --> 11:58.683
- What is that!
- Your welcome.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.218
- Mm hmm.
- Uh huh.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.073
What's down there?

12:23.109 --> 12:25.410
If I'm not mistaken,
the basement.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.412
Well, maybe we can
skip the basement.

12:28.447 --> 12:29.914
As long as it
doesn't get jealous.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.452
Romantic mood officially over.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.031
Hello?

12:52.805 --> 12:54.372
I'm gonna check it out.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.841
Really?

12:58.811 --> 13:01.379
I refuse to be intimidated
by my own house.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.828
It's cold down here.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.801
What's that?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.503
Just me.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.972
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.811
Name's Oscar.
I'm the electrician.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.013
You called us about
replacing your furnace.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.118
Right. I didn't think you were
coming until tomorrow.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.788
I had some down time, so I
thought I'd check it out today.

13:43.790 --> 13:48.626
- That real estate lady...
- Yeah, she let me in.

13:48.628 --> 13:53.932
Yeah, I didn't see your truck out front.
Sorry. This is my wife, Jennifer. I'm Paul.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.701
I'd shake,
but it's kinda dirty down here.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.369
Got it.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.940
So, listen, you don't seem to have
any problem with your heating.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.342
Good furnace. Built to last.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.979
Apparently, there was a fire
here a couple of years ago

14:07.981 --> 14:09.681
and a girl got burnt
pretty badly.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.951
I wouldn't go
sticking your face in there.

14:12.953 --> 14:16.221
These suckers get pretty hot.
Damn hot.

14:18.324 --> 14:23.228
Yeah, well, if we were to replace
this one, how much would it cost?

14:23.230 --> 14:26.497
Well, I'll let you know when
I'm done with my assessment.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.800
Just trying to figure out
where all these pipes lead.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.436
Lot of pipe down here.

14:34.039 --> 14:38.509
Okay, we'll leave you to it, and you'll
let us know when you have an estimate?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.411
Will do.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.580
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

14:44.216 --> 14:48.486
Oh hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a key to this door, would you?

14:48.488 --> 14:53.992
You see, this pipe up here goes
through the wall into there

14:53.994 --> 14:57.896
and this door, it's stuck,
locked or something.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.536
Sorry, we only have keys
to the main doors.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.072
That's all right.
I'll figure it out.

15:08.607 --> 15:09.807
Thank you.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.956
Mmm...

15:57.958 --> 16:01.559
Where were we?
Wanna have some fun time?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.329
With Oscar, the pervy electrician
standing by? I don't think so.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.898
We'll lock him in the basement
so he can't watch.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.967
Forget it!

16:08.969 --> 16:13.137
Absolutely no sexual activity until
creepy 'Mr. fix-it' is gone.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.322
I guess I jarred you loose.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.569
What the fuck is this shit?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.086
Oh, gimme a fucking break!

17:05.724 --> 17:08.526
Okay, fuck this shit.
Get me out of here!

17:13.298 --> 17:14.965
Get me the fuck out of here!

17:15.634 --> 17:17.035
Open the goddamn door.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.450
Oh, Jesus.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.224
Fuck you.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.961
Jesus Christ!

17:46.031 --> 17:49.400
Too many weird fucking fumes
in these cellars.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.903
It's playing with my head.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.501
Help me, dear god!

18:28.974 --> 18:30.942
Hey, you almost done?
It's getting late.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.212
Hello?

18:35.881 --> 18:36.981
Oscar?

18:42.554 --> 18:44.155
Good news. He's gone.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.503
It's like the second home run.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.838
- I'm filthy dirty.
- That's what I love about you.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.875
No, I mean dirt-dirt. Real dirt.
Unpacking dirt.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.177
Let's take a bath first.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.147
What comes second?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.415
Hopefully, both of us,
if we're lucky.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.851
Oh.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.755
Look what I found
in the back of the closet.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.558
Wow. Spirit board.

19:22.127 --> 19:24.595
I know exactly
what I wanna do with it.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.065
So do I.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.731
By the way,
Karen's gonna come for a visit.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.067
- Your sister, Karen?
- Uh huh.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.569
Isn't she still in school?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.604
Well. Her school's so close now.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.874
- Wonderful.
- What?

20:09.876 --> 20:12.210
I said, "wonderful."

20:12.212 --> 20:17.215
I can't wait to see her again.
She's such a... Joy to be around.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.317
Mm. Somebody really wants
to get laid tonight.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.937
What the?

21:18.310 --> 21:20.344
Someone is playful tonight!

21:32.758 --> 21:34.692
What are you doing down there?

21:40.265 --> 21:42.800
Honey, if you keep that up,
I won't be able to...

22:13.865 --> 22:15.032
What?

22:21.807 --> 22:23.741
Hope you're ready
for some real fun.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.879
Just give me a minute. Okay?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.515
I don't think
I can wait a minute.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.485
God, the weirdest thing
just happened in the bathroom.

22:34.487 --> 22:38.222
Whatever it was, it must have
turned you on big time.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.290
How did you know?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.426
I reap the benefits.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.763
Not yet, you haven't,
but you will.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.034
Honey... yeah.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.838
Woah, honey.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.807
Honey, woah, woah.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.944
I need a little down time,
all right?

23:00.812 --> 23:03.214
You practically drained me dry.

23:03.882 --> 23:04.981
Seriously?

23:04.983 --> 23:07.451
After all that talk about doing
it in every room of the house,

23:07.453 --> 23:09.186
now you're not
in the mood any more?

23:09.188 --> 23:11.489
Look, I'm sorry. I mean...

23:11.491 --> 23:13.824
- I warned you...
- Really? Okay, I get it.

23:13.826 --> 23:17.395
You're just teaching me a lesson, right?
Because I made you wait.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.830
- Honey...
- Forget it.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.400
Forget it, it's fine.
Let's just go to sleep.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.773
Good night.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.147
Well, the house is great.
It's Jen that I don't get.

24:10.149 --> 24:14.218
You know, one minute she's sex-crazed
and the next she's just crazed.

24:14.220 --> 24:19.089
Why don't you and I swap wives?
Just for a week.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.724
- Hey, watch it!
- No...

24:20.726 --> 24:23.661
I think I can help you with this.
I'm really good at it.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.862
Do you wanna get punched?

24:25.897 --> 24:29.233
No... please no punching.
But look,

24:29.235 --> 24:32.937
I'm just like you on the inside.

24:32.939 --> 24:37.508
There's nothing more that I wanna
do than just curl up like a baby

24:37.510 --> 24:41.245
and go to sleep after the
deal is sealed. But...

24:41.247 --> 24:43.948
But, there's nothing that pisses
off a woman more than that, okay.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.485
I tried it once with Stacy.
Once. No time off.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.287
Howard...

24:50.289 --> 24:52.809
When you're right, you're right.
You're not as dumb as you look.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.960
I'm gonna make it up to her.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.428
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

24:57.430 --> 24:59.697
- What, you're gonna make it
up to her right now? - Yes.

24:59.699 --> 25:04.168
Well, can you film it? Just...
tell her it was my idea.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.442
Okay.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.303
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck!

26:47.939 --> 26:49.707
Oh, my god,
you got to be kidding me!

26:56.381 --> 26:57.681
I forgot my key.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.317
Honey, what happened?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.553
I'm doing laundry.

27:04.389 --> 27:05.889
I don't think
you're doing it right.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.692
I'm joking!

27:22.574 --> 27:23.974
I called the plumber.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.911
Couldn't fix it yourself, huh?

27:27.913 --> 27:30.781
Well, this coupled with
your bathtub last night,

27:30.783 --> 27:33.651
I thought it wouldn't hurt to
call an expert to check it out.

27:33.653 --> 27:37.788
The rest of the day and night is yours.
I'll do whatever you want.

27:37.790 --> 27:42.493
Order in, go out.
I'm at your service, my lady.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.029
- I can use a little service.
- What's that?

27:45.031 --> 27:47.131
Nothing. Great.

27:47.133 --> 27:50.300
So, what'll it be?

27:50.302 --> 27:56.106
We did spend all of our money on this house.
Seems a shame not to take advantage of it.

27:56.108 --> 27:59.343
In it is. Quiet evening,
just the two of us.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.646
You left out "romantic."

28:04.450 --> 28:05.949
I was just getting to that part.

28:09.455 --> 28:13.223
- You didn't tell the plumber to come
today night, did you? - Tomorrow morning.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.793
If it's him,
I'll tell him to come back.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.629
Come back, my ass!

28:19.631 --> 28:21.899
Took me three buses to get here!

28:21.901 --> 28:23.233
How's it hanging, Paul?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.803
Karen, impeccable timing,
as always.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.304
It's a gift.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.406
Is my domesticated
other-half around?

28:30.308 --> 28:33.243
- Karen?
- Oh, my god!

28:33.245 --> 28:35.245
You remember my name!

28:35.247 --> 28:37.715
You haven't totally
brainwashed her, yet, huh?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.683
Aw, I thought you were
coming in a few days.

28:39.685 --> 28:43.487
I was bored. Nice flowers,
you buy those, Paul?

28:43.489 --> 28:47.324
As a matter of fact... I did.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.526
That's so weird, they were
fine a few minutes ago.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.696
They look fine to me, but I am
going through my "black phase."

28:52.698 --> 28:54.431
This is the fruit
of your labors.

28:56.901 --> 29:00.104
All those years of
rich relatives really paid off.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.639
I bought this house
with my money... our money.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.712
Must be nice when
you can work for daddy.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.548
So, Karen, how's school?

29:11.550 --> 29:15.085
Sucks. How's your job?
Quite as usual?

29:15.087 --> 29:17.454
Kinda what you'd be expecting
when you work in a bookstore.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.490
- And how's your job, Paul?
- Fine.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.960
Took a couple of days off
until we're all settled in.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.030
I'm sure they will survive
without you.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.067
Okay. Great you could come all
the way down here to see us.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.635
Must you be leaving so soon?

29:35.240 --> 29:38.542
Come on, guys, really? Please...

29:39.978 --> 29:42.312
Look, I've got the guest room
almost ready for you.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.981
Come upstairs,
let me show you around.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.390
Good lord, what do you
have in here? Rocks?

29:53.392 --> 29:56.260
Close. Crystals, brimstones.

29:56.262 --> 29:59.296
I'm dating this guy who's really obsessed
with the whole psychic vibe thing.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.697
Hey, you want
a tarot card reading?

30:00.699 --> 30:03.667
Maybe I can tell you how long
you an Paul will be together.

30:28.693 --> 30:32.129
All right, trouble-maker.
Hope this will do.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.932
So, read any good books lately?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.433
Ha ha.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.368
That gets you every time,
doesn't it?

30:38.370 --> 30:40.204
Listen, do me a favor.

30:40.206 --> 30:43.674
Please, please, please, make an
effort to be nice to Paul this time.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.976
- I always try. He hates me.
- Because you hate him.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.412
- Because he hates me.
- Oh, great! This is mature.

30:55.486 --> 30:56.787
Oh.

31:03.328 --> 31:06.797
Look, I don't hate him. I just
think he's a spoiled, ungrateful,

31:06.799 --> 31:08.799
egotistical, self-centered
mama's boy.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.635
- Oh, is that all?
- Yeah. It's nothing personal.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.109
Huh?

31:24.048 --> 31:26.016
I wish I had a key.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.330
Interesting design choice.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.101
Ah... okay.

31:45.670 --> 31:46.837
So...

31:49.274 --> 31:50.841
You're the flower killer.

31:52.510 --> 31:53.777
Yeah.

31:57.548 --> 31:58.849
What the...

32:05.556 --> 32:10.027
Okay, okay, I'll be nice. I'm just
trying to look out for my big sister.

32:10.029 --> 32:12.295
You know it's supposed to be
the other way around, right?

32:12.297 --> 32:14.131
Yeah, but,
I always try to be different.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.432
Oh, that's for sure.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.846
I did sense a little tension
when I got here.

32:30.415 --> 32:31.815
You seem stressed.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.184
No, no, everything's fine.

32:35.286 --> 32:37.988
- Mostly, I mean.
- Mostly?

32:49.334 --> 32:52.002
We need you, Paul.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.208
We need you, Paul.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.678
We need you, Paul.

33:37.782 --> 33:43.053
I'm... so... so... sorry.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.794
Okay, recap.

33:50.796 --> 33:55.065
Dangerous furnace,
short-circuiting washing machine,

33:55.067 --> 33:57.167
creepy electrician...

33:57.169 --> 34:00.504
So, the moral of the story is,
"stay out of the basement."

34:00.506 --> 34:02.406
- Pretty much.
- Hm.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.608
Then, perhaps you can use this.

34:12.382 --> 34:15.351
- What is this?
- It's a necklace.

34:15.353 --> 34:18.321
It's used to ward off evil.
For protection.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.190
Will it protect me against you?

34:20.192 --> 34:22.492
Nothing can protect you from me.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.523
Paul?

34:57.195 --> 34:58.695
Paul?
We're just discussing dinner.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.866
Maybe he took off.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.835
No, he wouldn't do that.

35:14.912 --> 35:16.146
Paul?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.348
Geez.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.718
Jennifer. Karen.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.121
What were you doing down there?

35:24.123 --> 35:26.623
I was checking
the washing machine.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.558
Oh. Any luck?

35:28.560 --> 35:32.762
No, it's best not to
go down there at the moment.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.365
Yeah, then, for once,
we're in agreement.

35:40.938 --> 35:46.910
So listen, I was thinking...
Maybe we should go out tonight.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.813
Stacy told me about a really great middle
eastern restaurant that's near by,

35:49.815 --> 35:52.516
and ive heard
good things about it.

35:52.518 --> 35:55.418
I thought we were
staying in tonight.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.354
I know,
but now we have a guest, honey.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.189
And we want to be good hosts,
right?

35:59.191 --> 36:02.959
- Take her out, show her the town.
- Good hosts?

36:02.961 --> 36:04.995
Yes.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.864
Uh, sure. I am all over that.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.301
We haven't been out
in quite a while.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.437
Okay, you wanna go upstairs and
change, and we'll take my car?

36:15.773 --> 36:19.743
Yes, I will go change.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.405
Uh, okay,
he's acting fucking weird.

36:48.407 --> 36:52.909
He's trying to be on best behavior.
I suggest you do the same.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.278
We're changing our plans for you.
Don't forget that.

37:14.765 --> 37:18.535
Without a reservation,
it's gonna be a few minutes.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.504
You may wait at the bar,
if you wish.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.708
Bar sounds good. I could use a drink.
Karen, you?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.743
- Always.
- I don't like to wait.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.448
Let it go. We came
to have a good time, right?

37:32.883 --> 37:37.554
Good times... Yes... Jennifer.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.189
I'm ready to have some fun.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.126
Hi.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.629
- What would you like to drink?
- I'll take a red wine, please.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.831
- A Cuba libre.
- Red wine, Cuba libre.

37:48.132 --> 37:49.566
Perfect.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.968
Tell me about this guy
you're seeing.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.104
What's he like, what's his name?

37:54.106 --> 37:56.273
Oh, excuse me, do you work here?

37:56.275 --> 38:00.443
I do, but unfortunately, I just
started my ten minute break.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.112
His name is Patrick.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.214
Someone else here
would be happy to help you.

38:04.216 --> 38:07.017
Oh, I don't want someone else.
I just want you.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.253
What the hell
is your husband doing?

38:10.255 --> 38:13.156
He's probably just trying
to get us a table earlier.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.425
- Cabernet.
- Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.161
Can I let you in
on a little secret?

38:18.163 --> 38:21.298
You couldn't <i> have me</i>
if hell froze over.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.599
What if I told you...

38:22.601 --> 38:25.435
To the keeper that Paul is.

38:25.437 --> 38:30.807
I could provide you with the most explosive
sexual experience of your entire life.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.678
Four words.
"Never going to happen."

38:35.579 --> 38:37.147
Never say never.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.716
Excuse me sir, can I help you
with something from the bar?

38:40.484 --> 38:41.685
Milk.

38:43.788 --> 38:47.957
I'm sorry, sir, we don't carry milk here.
Can I offer you something else?

38:47.959 --> 38:49.659
Just those two things
came to mind.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.663
You don't know
what you're missing.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.877
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

39:13.284 --> 39:15.752
How is this possible? What?

39:18.556 --> 39:21.524
No! I want my breasts back.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.792
Oh.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.436
Table for three.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.272
In a few more minutes, sir.

39:37.975 --> 39:38.975
Now.

39:57.762 --> 40:00.263
- Our table?
- Yes.

40:01.198 --> 40:02.632
Right this way.

40:12.510 --> 40:13.810
Mm.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.247
I forgot how good food tastes.

40:17.249 --> 40:21.718
Well, now that we've got a home, I'll be
able to cook you genuine, home cooked meals.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.720
Mm.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.370
So, tell me some more about that
psychic stuff you're studying.

40:30.795 --> 40:34.697
Forget about it. You guys are just
gonna think it's bullshit an way.

40:34.699 --> 40:37.100
Not at all. I'm very
interested in the subject.

40:37.102 --> 40:41.171
So, you know about crystals,
astral projections, the occult?

40:41.572 --> 40:43.440
Intimately.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.643
I also know it's quite dangerous to
play around with some of those things.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.078
Just ask Margaret black.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.781
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't.
She's dead.

40:51.783 --> 40:55.819
- Who? - That was the woman
who used to won our house.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.122
How do you know Margaret
black was into the occult?

40:59.124 --> 41:03.893
Our real estate agent, Monica... When I
pressed about details about the house...

41:03.895 --> 41:07.263
As it turns out, young Maggie
black had a dark secret.

41:07.265 --> 41:11.768
One that she kept from her husband
and entire family, for that matter.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.337
Ever since that party
in her parent's basement...

41:14.339 --> 41:15.905
<i>I think it was
in the early 70's.</i>

41:19.510 --> 41:22.178
I am the god of hellfire.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.681
And I bring you fire.

41:34.859 --> 41:39.162
Peace, joy, love, Satan.

41:41.465 --> 41:42.632
Who invited those girls?

41:42.634 --> 41:44.667
I don't know. Don't look at me.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.836
I don't know them.
She's the one who knows them.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.605
They're painting the wall.

41:48.607 --> 41:52.876
Oh... I... I met them at
the party, last night.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.078
Pure magic!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.116
Oh, my god!

42:01.685 --> 42:04.354
They painted everything.

42:04.356 --> 42:08.057
You have to clean it up.
This is not what I wanted.

42:08.059 --> 42:11.361
Why fight what you desire,
Margaret black?

42:14.732 --> 42:17.901
- Oh!
- We can show you a real good time.

42:17.903 --> 42:21.471
My parents are gonna be back soon, so I
think maybe we should just call it a night.

42:21.473 --> 42:26.543
The black clouds, they can give
you everything you truly crave.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.678
What we all truly crave, girl.

42:28.680 --> 42:34.684
If you don't believe us, just
continue to stand right there.

42:34.686 --> 42:38.021
Wait, aren't you not supposed to
stand outside of the circle?

42:38.023 --> 42:41.624
But why?
All the fun happens within.

43:01.679 --> 43:04.581
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

43:12.022 --> 43:14.090
I can feel. I can feel.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.160
I can feel it inside of me.

43:46.223 --> 43:49.659
You must never leave the circle
during the ceremony.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.430
Ah!

43:54.432 --> 43:56.399
You fool, you let it out!

43:59.871 --> 44:04.207
We got to get out of here. We
got to get out of here. Get up!

44:10.181 --> 44:12.148
Get up! Get up!

44:32.002 --> 44:33.870
That fucking hurts.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.505
Stop doing it!

45:25.489 --> 45:27.323
Apparently, it was
quite the bloodbath.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.827
Amazingly enough,
young Maggie black

45:30.829 --> 45:34.464
managed to keep that
conjured demon-lover trapped

45:35.232 --> 45:36.933
in the basement room, hidden.

45:37.935 --> 45:39.635
Away for years and years.

45:40.671 --> 45:42.305
Until the day she...

45:43.674 --> 45:44.807
Disappeared.

45:46.910 --> 45:51.948
So, she had a pet incubus.
That's a first.

45:51.950 --> 45:56.919
Well, at some point...
All pets come out to play.

45:58.722 --> 46:00.690
Wait a second,
what's an incubus?

46:00.692 --> 46:03.192
They're demons
of lust and desire.

46:03.194 --> 46:07.997
Supposedly, they come to women at night
and make love to them while they sleep...

46:09.133 --> 46:11.734
Ravishing them, sexually.

46:11.736 --> 46:14.470
The powerful ones
can do it any time, any place.

46:15.405 --> 46:17.807
Make women explode
with pleasure.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.881
It's hard to fight
what feels good.

46:24.883 --> 46:27.383
So, there you go... oh!

46:30.821 --> 46:34.157
I'm sorry, excuse me. I don't
know what came over... oh!

46:39.063 --> 46:40.396
Are you okay?

46:42.332 --> 46:43.633
Yeah!

46:45.769 --> 46:47.537
Excuse me. Excuse me.

46:48.605 --> 46:49.972
Excuse me.

46:51.508 --> 46:53.976
Death by passion
is the ultimate rush.

46:57.782 --> 46:59.215
Desert, anyone?

47:01.852 --> 47:04.353
Ah! Ah!

47:04.355 --> 47:08.724
Wait a second, you didn't tell me Monica told
you exactly what happened to Margaret black.

47:09.426 --> 47:11.093
She didn't.

47:11.095 --> 47:13.729
You can safely bet that anyone who
thinks they can control a demon

47:13.731 --> 47:15.197
is in for a nasty surprise.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.100
They don't make good slaves.

47:18.702 --> 47:21.003
Not even sex slaves?

47:21.005 --> 47:24.874
Humans are better equipped for that.
Specially in death.

47:24.876 --> 47:28.544
Just think, maybe Maggie black
is its slave for all eternity.

47:33.517 --> 47:37.453
You had me going there for a second. I
actually thought you knew Maggie was dead and

47:37.455 --> 47:39.856
walled up in our
basement or something.

47:39.858 --> 47:44.360
Yeah, it's very
"Edgar Allan poe" of you.

47:44.362 --> 47:47.964
I'm sure I'll have very pleasant
dreams tonight after that story.

47:47.966 --> 47:49.799
It'll be a nice tale
to tell our children.

47:51.969 --> 47:54.070
Right.

47:54.072 --> 48:00.543
"Hey kids, the gateway to hell is in
our basement, so go get some sleep."

48:00.545 --> 48:03.980
All right, I got some extra towels for
you here, temperature should be okay,

48:03.982 --> 48:07.149
but, if you need some blankets or something,
they're in the closet. All right?

48:08.252 --> 48:10.152
- Anything else you need?
- Yeah.

48:10.154 --> 48:12.188
You can tell me
what the fuck is up with Paul.

48:12.190 --> 48:15.157
- Okay, just drop it. All right?
- You can't tell me you didn't notice.

48:15.159 --> 48:17.393
<i>Please.</i>

48:17.395 --> 48:21.397
<i>Those weird remarks at the bartender,
staring at the waitress' ass all evening,</i>

48:21.399 --> 48:23.866
<i>while flirting with her
right in front of you.</i>

48:23.868 --> 48:28.070
<i>Yes, I saw it. I get it. I'm
gonna handle it, all right?</i>

48:28.072 --> 48:30.752
<i>We've just been having some issues
since we moved into this house.</i>

50:03.100 --> 50:05.334
- Do you think he's having an affair?
- No!

50:05.336 --> 50:08.004
I mean, everything's been fine.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.840
It's just, we've been having
some timing issues, that's all.

50:10.842 --> 50:13.843
- So, are we talking. Like, premature?
- No!

50:14.678 --> 50:16.012
Maybe.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.282
Look, he wants it
and I'm not ready,

50:20.284 --> 50:24.720
and then I want to and he's not into it.
I don't know.

50:24.722 --> 50:28.357
You know what, I feel really
uncomfortable talking to you about this.

50:28.359 --> 50:33.562
Hey, sis, if you haven't
noticed, I'm all grown up.

50:34.564 --> 50:37.133
Paul sure has.

50:37.135 --> 50:40.736
And what's up with this
sudden interest in the occult?

50:40.738 --> 50:44.774
I have no idea. I don't know. Maybe he's
just trying to show off, or something.

50:45.475 --> 50:47.543
Hello, girls.

50:47.545 --> 50:49.678
Is this a private party
or can anyone join?

50:49.680 --> 50:52.581
- No party. - Karen was just
going to sleep, and so are we.

50:52.583 --> 50:53.749
Good night.

50:55.218 --> 50:57.053
Good night, Karen.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.121
Night.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.158
Ugh, creeper!

51:04.494 --> 51:07.696
You sure you don't want to
invite little sis in to join us?

51:07.698 --> 51:09.832
The three of us could
have a really wild night.

51:09.834 --> 51:14.003
That's not funny, Paul. Don't talk about
Karen like that. Not even joking.

51:14.005 --> 51:16.705
I'm not joking.
She's pretty hot.

51:16.707 --> 51:19.375
I especially like
her black lipstick.

51:19.377 --> 51:22.211
Good, it'll match the black eye
I'm about to give you.

51:22.213 --> 51:24.346
Touchy, touchy.

51:24.348 --> 51:27.349
- Touchy...
- Don't even think about it.

51:27.351 --> 51:31.220
If your goal tonight was to make
me jealous, you failed miserably.

51:31.222 --> 51:33.122
I'm fucking pissed off.

51:33.124 --> 51:36.358
- As long as fucking is in the equation.
- Are you insane?

51:36.360 --> 51:39.728
You actually think I'm gonna have sex with
you after the way you behaved tonight?

51:39.730 --> 51:42.064
What do you mean?
I was on my best behavior.

51:42.066 --> 51:45.501
Karen saw what you were doing.
And do you think I'm blind?

51:46.536 --> 51:47.703
Oh, god.

51:49.272 --> 51:53.109
I know you've been wanting it
ever since we moved in here.

51:53.111 --> 51:57.446
If you think that bath last night,
and washing machine ride felt good,

52:00.584 --> 52:05.788
just wait until you experience
the real me in all of my glory.

52:05.790 --> 52:08.991
You see, I made certain
improvements to this body...

52:08.993 --> 52:10.826
That I think you'll really like.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.733
Find somewhere else to sleep,
asshole.

52:17.735 --> 52:20.736
If I'm downstairs, how am I
going to screw your brains out?

52:21.404 --> 52:23.172
Oh, wow.

52:23.174 --> 52:24.907
Although I have my ways.

52:25.575 --> 52:27.409
Good night, Paul.

52:27.411 --> 52:29.211
You're actually kicking me out?

52:31.448 --> 52:33.649
Exactly what did
Karen say to you?

52:33.651 --> 52:36.752
We'll talk about it tomorrow. Hopefully,
you'll come to your senses by then.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.421
You don't know
what you're missing.

52:40.657 --> 52:42.758
Yes, I do. But I'll live.

52:51.134 --> 52:52.535
Doubtful.

53:15.325 --> 53:17.026
Good. You're still awake.

53:18.028 --> 53:20.362
Can I help you with something,
Paul?

53:20.364 --> 53:24.733
Actually you can. And I think I
might be able to help you, as well.

53:28.839 --> 53:32.074
You see, her loss is your gain.

53:33.376 --> 53:37.646
Wow. Now I see
what Jenny sees in you.

53:37.648 --> 53:41.584
Deformity. The door's
that way, elephant man.

53:41.586 --> 53:45.888
Maybe I won't mention this incredible
lack of judgment to Jenny.

53:45.890 --> 53:49.992
You know, for someone
who's so into demons and devils,

53:49.994 --> 53:52.561
I'm surprised you never
considered how it would feel.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.164
How would what feel?

53:55.166 --> 53:57.266
For him to get into you.

54:01.905 --> 54:04.506
Fuck! Jenny!

54:04.508 --> 54:06.909
Help! What's going on?

54:06.911 --> 54:10.246
Oh, my god. Jenny, help!
Somebody help me!

54:30.233 --> 54:31.867
You should not have interfered.

54:41.244 --> 54:42.811
You like it gentle or rough?

54:43.480 --> 54:44.813
Fuck you!

54:49.419 --> 54:51.153
My thoughts exactly.

55:32.495 --> 55:33.929
Karen?

55:45.442 --> 55:48.577
Paul? Where's Karen?

55:52.649 --> 55:56.285
Good morning, Jennifer.
She came and went.

55:56.287 --> 55:58.167
Had a nine o'clock class.
Didn't wanna wake you.

55:59.122 --> 56:01.623
She said she'd call
in a few days.

56:01.625 --> 56:04.193
Couldn't even stay
for breakfast. Want some?

56:05.195 --> 56:07.463
No, thanks.

56:07.465 --> 56:09.431
Jennifer, I'm so sorry
about last night.

56:10.667 --> 56:13.635
You were right.
I was way out of line.

56:15.472 --> 56:19.375
I promise to make it up to you...
If you let me.

56:20.877 --> 56:23.912
Yeah, sure.

56:23.914 --> 56:28.150
The eggs almost done. Could you
make sure they don't burn?

56:30.420 --> 56:32.921
I'm gonna run upstairs.
I think I need a shower.

56:40.697 --> 56:43.065
Now that Karen's gone,
nothing's gonna come between us.

57:02.752 --> 57:04.920
Karen?

57:04.922 --> 57:08.023
No, ma'am. I'm Leo,
with flow plumbers.

57:08.025 --> 57:09.892
- Right.
- I received a call the other day.

57:09.894 --> 57:12.694
Of course, yes. My husband called you.
Come on in.

57:12.696 --> 57:17.633
Thank you. Something about the
water pipes and a washing machine.

57:18.902 --> 57:21.770
We're dying out.
It's this way, in the basement.

57:21.772 --> 57:23.705
Let's take a look
at the little monster.

57:31.481 --> 57:33.615
Oh, you're out. Great!

57:33.617 --> 57:34.715
Where are you going?

57:34.717 --> 57:37.920
I got to go to the store. We just
got a huge shipment of books.

57:37.922 --> 57:39.855
I thought we were
gonna have a little fun time.

57:41.491 --> 57:44.092
We will, when I get back

57:44.094 --> 57:47.996
and the plumbers gone. I promise you,
we will have tons of make-up time.

57:48.832 --> 57:50.599
When's the plumber coming?

57:50.601 --> 57:53.235
He's here already.
You called him, remember?

57:54.571 --> 57:56.839
If he needs anything,
you'll take care of him, right?

57:56.841 --> 57:59.141
Yes, I will take care of him.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.977
Okay... see you tonight.

58:36.212 --> 58:37.279
Hello?

58:40.049 --> 58:42.284
Somebody out there?

58:42.286 --> 58:46.955
Mr. hemdale?
Ah, there's nobody out there.

58:46.957 --> 58:48.624
Hi, there.

58:49.626 --> 58:50.893
Hi.

58:53.831 --> 58:57.065
Uh, I didn't know
anyone else was down here.

58:57.067 --> 59:00.736
I'm the plumber, Leo.
I just came to fix the...

59:00.738 --> 59:03.372
Washing machine.

59:09.512 --> 59:10.879
Holy shit!

59:16.819 --> 59:20.389
Wha... hi.

59:20.391 --> 59:23.959
Look, it's not that I don't
appreciate the offer, but... -mm hmm.

59:28.865 --> 59:30.933
I need you inside of me.

59:31.434 --> 59:32.568
Who are you?

59:35.573 --> 59:38.340
Okay, wait, stop okay.

59:38.342 --> 59:41.209
Wait, just wait.

59:41.211 --> 59:44.746
Look, I said... oh, Jesus!

59:47.684 --> 59:49.651
I'm definitely getting fired.

59:58.394 --> 01:00:01.663
Come on! You're so fucking hot!

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.602
No one's ever
going to believe this!

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.804
No one will ever find out.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.476
Get off me!

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:39.067
Give me his keys.
I need to move his car.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.374
And now, take him inside.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.809
She needs nourishment.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.545
It's coming soon.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:54.650
You did well, Karen.

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:14.429
Paul, hey.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.999
Hey, what happened?
I missed you this morning.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:23.271
I had an issue with the plumber.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:26.508
- Hey, what happened with you and Jen?
- Everything is in order now.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:31.246
See, I told you! Hey, maybe
you can help me with Stacey.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:37.452
I mean, she's making me work out twice a
day now, until I lose some more weight.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:40.288
Maybe you should try working out in
the bedroom. It's a lot more fun.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.358
That's exactly what I said,
but that's a no-go.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.129
She said no sexy-sexy, until you
lose at least 10 or 20 pounds.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.431
And I'm like, "well,
fuck you very much, then."

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.531
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.300
Well, not fuck you,
as the case may be.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.202
Maybe you should bring her
by the house tonight.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.938
What's going on tonight?
House warming?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.242
Something like that.
It would be a celebration.

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:02.711
Celebrations are joyous.

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:12.053
<i>Hey. It's Karen. Leave a message.
Or don't. Beep.</i>

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:14.790
Karen, hey, it's me.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:20.195
Listen, call me back when you get this. I
wanna... I wanna talk to you more about Paul.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.533
I had the most horrible
dream last night, and I...

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.569
Just call me when you get this,
okay?

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.088
I should restock these.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:52.928
Hi.

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:00.829
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.731
- You okay?
- Yeah. It was my fault.

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:05.053
- Don't worry about that. I'll recover.
- Sorry about that.

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.338
- Are you Mrs. hemdale?
- Yes.

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.407
Yes, can I help you?

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.910
No. But I think I can help you.

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:16.878
You're living in the house,
aren't you?

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.413
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:19.848
The only survivor.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.558
The accident with the furnace.
You're the girl.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.596
It was no accident. There's something
evil living in that house.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:37.832
Have you been in the cellar?

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:41.569
Have you seen the black room?

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:45.740
Leave! Take your
husband and get out!

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:52.447
It'll try to seduce you, trick you
with pleasure, make you want more.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:56.451
It feeds off human desires.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:06:02.157
But, if you're not careful, it
will literally eat you alive.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:05.427
I've been in the basement. It's a little
creepy but... -you don't understand.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:06.962
My grandmother...

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.465
Did not disappear,
like they say.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.669
She was swallowed up
by that house.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.708
She died saving my life...

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:25.180
Trying to trap the evil that
was summoned decades earlier.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.185
Get out,
before it takes you, too!

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.421
Body and soul.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.261
Wait...

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:23.638
Paul?

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.109
Paul, are you upstairs?

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:38.053
Paul?

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.322
Paul?

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:44.125
Paul?

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:47.796
Paul?

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.272
Jennifer?

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.010
You scared me to death!

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:04.512
Oh, what would be
the fun in that?

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.782
- What are you doing down here?
- I was looking for you.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.418
What's in there?

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.155
I don't know.
I can't find the key.

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:19.426
You sure you haven't been in there? Cause
I can swore I heard the door slam.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.198
Try for yourself.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.939
- Weird.
- Mm.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:34.309
You know what, I'm gonna
call Monica, the realtor.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.544
Let's see if she's got a key.

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:40.715
Hey...
I have a surprise for you.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.417
A couple of surprises, actually.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:47.055
I was paid a visit, today...

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:49.557
By the girl who's family
sold us this house.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:50.725
The one who was burned.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.231
Dawn black.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.669
Yeah, how do you know her name?

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:05.006
Oh, Monica must have
mentioned her to me.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.509
What did she say?

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.844
- Monica?
- No, dawn.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.350
She said this house is evil.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:18.252
And that people have died here,
and that we should move, now!

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:22.957
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:25.760
You've been acting like an
asshole ever since we moved in.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.929
Maybe this house
has infected you.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.236
Look, I've been doing some research today
at the store, and I found this book.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.907
Do you know what
these Celtic symbols mean?

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.179
And then, Karen,
she gave me this last night...

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.848
Get that thing away from me!
Paul!

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.618
Are you really going to listen to the
advice of some 20-year-old twit?

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.688
Of course, she hates this place.
She nearly died here.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:58.259
You think her memories are going to be
all puppy dogs and rainbows, Jennifer?

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.399
She said something about a room in the
basement... a black room, maybe that's it.

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:07.769
Jennifer, Jennifer...
Listen to me.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:12.340
I didn't mean to
raise my voice, but

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.943
the girl went through
a traumatic experience.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:21.182
She lost her grandmother.
She nearly lost her face,

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:24.419
she's probably not
thinking too clearly.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:27.989
And what about all that family history you so
graciously spewed out at dinner, last night?

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.658
Rumors.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.396
Just rumors, probably started
by that silly girl, dawn black.

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:41.336
Maybe so, but I'm gonna find
out what's behind that door.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.583
Who you calling?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:59.153
I told you, Monica, the realtor.
I wanna see if she's got a key.

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.100
Hello?

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.167
Hello?

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:15.870
Hello?

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.773
Goodbye.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:22.910
Oh, Bob, margot,
you're nice and late.

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.178
What's wrong?

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.048
Phone died.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:31.953
I will add telephone repairman
to the menu.

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.223
I'll just call her on this.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.361
Who's that?

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:44.198
Might be Satan.
Better not let him in.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:59.414
- Howard, Stacey...
- Hey.

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:02.183
- What are you doing here?
- We're here for your house warming party.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.187
Surprise.

01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:16.130
As far as I know,
she was the previous owner.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:17.432
She's really pretty.

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.502
So, who else
did you invite, honey?

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:26.040
I invited Karen, and the plumber
and the electrician.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:29.143
Who knows?
They may all pop up later.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:33.448
This is a marvelous house, and at that
price, you two made out like bandits.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:34.849
- Mm.
- Can I get the tour?

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.885
Just this way.

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:40.521
It's really good cheese.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:44.125
- You boys be good now.
- Oh, that's asking a lot, Stacey.

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:45.960
I think you've had enough.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.633
All he ever does
is eat, eat, eat.

01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:56.371
Howard, I have something
I'd like to show you.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.539
- This way.
- What is it?

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:02.777
Oh, trust me, it's to die for.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:12.453
What re you hiding down here?

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:17.058
Is it like a torture dungeon?

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.727
- Close. Very close.
- Did you guys get a sex wing?

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.266
After you.

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:29.137
Oh, this is very good.
50 shades of black, good.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.642
All's dark in here.

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:40.281
Okay, Paul,
what am I supposed to do?

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.423
Oh, my god.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.192
What the hell is this...

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.698
That's exactly what it is.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.870
Last but not least,
the master bedroom.

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:08.643
Oh, wow. This is simply lovely.

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:10.812
I'm sure you get a
good night's sleep on this.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:13.014
Well, yeah, unfortunately,
that's about all I get.

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.416
You're lucky.

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:17.151
I'm thinking of
getting Howard neutered.

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:21.222
I mean, it would make everything
a whole lot easier for me.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:25.226
What's the big deal with sex, any way? I've
always thought it's totally overrated.

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.499
- Oh, great, it's working.
- What?

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.334
Oh, my phone was out, earlier.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:36.404
Stacey, would you mind if
I made a really quick call

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:38.773
and I just meet you downstairs
in a couple of minutes.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:40.341
Of course.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:43.478
I'll just go see what my fat husband
is stuffing himself with now.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.018
Thanks so much for coming.
Maybe next time.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.855
Bullshit... Hello?

01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:56.624
Monica, hi,
this is Jennifer hemdale.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:15:00.194
I had a couple of questions I wanted to
ask about the house. Is now a good time?

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.064
No, no problem at all.
I'm used to a 14-hour day.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.703
Um, hello? Where's everybody?

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.405
What is this? Hide and seek?

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.370
Oh!

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.411
Um, the lights are out.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.714
Um, hello?

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.984
Is somebody...

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:06.093
Hello?

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.063
Who's there?

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.838
That's not funny, Paul.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.609
This is why I'm not laughing.
I'm sorry. Our fuse blew.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.912
Yeah, I kinda figured that.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.381
- Mm hmm.
- Where's Howard?

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:33.120
He's in the basement, helping me fix it.
We could use you, too.

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.856
- Me?
- Mm hmm.

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:39.794
To hold the flashlight.
It's this way.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.431
I'll help you go down. Come.

01:16:57.412 --> 01:17:00.314
So, Howard tells me
you're a frigid little bitch.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:03.250
- What?
- Which is a shame...

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:06.287
It looks like you have a
killer body under those clothes.

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:08.889
You know, let's have a look-see,
shall we?

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.065
Yes.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.001
Not bad. Not bad at all.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:23.471
Prepare her.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.492
Why are all the lights out
down there?

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.394
Paul?

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.230
Stacey?

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:52.667
Howard?

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:58.606
Just me, hon.
The downstairs breaker blew out.

01:17:58.608 --> 01:18:01.776
I guess we should have checked the fine
print before we got this place, huh?

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.078
Yeah.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.318
When they leave,
we need to talk.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.555
Oh, they're already gone.
It's just you and me now.

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.859
What happened?

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.396
You know Howard and Stacey.
It got pretty messy.

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.533
Did they get into a fight?

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.870
You can say that.
Neither of them won.

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.606
You find that amusing?

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.377
Listen, Paul, I just got
off the phone with Monica.

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.379
You did?

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.116
I see.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:48.055
Did she go and ruin my surprise?

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.623
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:53.060
Let me guess.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:57.598
She probably told you that she never
mentioned dawn black to me by name.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.068
And that she didn't know anything about
the history of this house, or...

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.238
Maggie black's
tampering with the occult, or

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.374
the incubus.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.777
As a matter of fact,
that's exactly what she said.

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:13.280
Now you're wondering
how I knew all those things.

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:16.951
Was there any truth to what that burnt
up bitch told you this afternoon.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.222
Paul.

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:24.692
I bet you really want to know what's inside
that black room in the basement, don't you?

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:26.092
Paul, you're starting
to scare me.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:32.965
Well then, come downstairs and see what I've
been working on for the past two and half years.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.607
I don't understand
what's gotten into you.

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.481
Paul?

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:51.519
Paul?

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.790
Paul, tell me what's going on.

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.690
Paul, stop screwing around.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.397
Come on.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.113
What?

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:28.148
Oh, my god.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.088
Do you like it?

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:40.294
Congratulations.
We are going to have a baby.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.264
- Paul?
- No, sorry.

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.400
Guess again.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:54.008
Oh, my god.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:58.612
Welcome to the womb of the house. You're
just in time to help with the delivery.

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:06.453
Oh, Karen! Oh, my god!
Oh, Karen!

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:10.624
They are all
serving a purpose, Jennifer.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:14.061
Sebastian titan set the ball
in motion when he conjured me

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:17.831
to seduce young,
lovely Maggie black.

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:24.071
Oh, she tried to trap me.

01:22:24.073 --> 01:22:27.574
Didn't you? Yes, you did!

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:31.478
Of course, never realizing
that I had plans of my own.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.115
You see, demons from my
dimension have special powers.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:40.054
But there are limits, and
boundaries that cannot be crossed.

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:42.623
That is, of course,
unless the line

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:47.828
between our world
and yours can be broken down.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:52.800
In order to do this,
a new breed must be created.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:59.406
Human on the outside.
Demon within.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.845
You killed Paul, you bastard.
You killed him!

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:09.116
You see, I needed a host body
to plant the final seed.

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:11.418
And Paul provided that.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:16.457
In order to be truly immortal,
no, no...

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:19.259
One has to be reborn.

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:25.265
And nourishment is required
to build strength.

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:30.771
Feeding off your sexual energy
has been very productive.

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:39.713
Others require
rougher treatment.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:56.163
- Where am I? What's going on?
- Stacey?

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:58.899
- Oh, my god.
- What the hell is this?

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.468
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:07.641
Get it off!

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:11.845
Oh, no, Jennifer.
Don't play with the food.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:15.649
See, I expect this one to be
an especially tasty meal.

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:19.586
Repressed sexual energy
is a very potent source.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:22.089
It can just be sucked out.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.279
Oh, oh no!

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.462
It's finally time.

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:04.998
Now, I must join the party.

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:17.478
When I am reborn, you will
be the first to feed me.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.047
My new form will be magnificent.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.952
Jennifer, now!

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:27.454
His is your only chance.
Save him!

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:37.798
Pull, pull, pull.
Fight it. Fight it.

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.501
I won't let you have him!

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.704
Fight it! Harder!

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.085
Oh, my god!

01:25:58.087 --> 01:26:00.053
- Jen? Jen, what happened?
- I lost you.

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:05.058
Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:07.928
You're welcome.

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.006
That doesn't look good.

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.741
Get up!

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.547
It's starting to give birth.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.619
You've gotta
get out of here, now!

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.526
What are you doing?

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:41.962
When one's in labor,
you have to push, hard!

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.248
Over here.

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:42.522
- A knife?
- It's better than nothing.

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:47.594
Run!

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.298
Go, go!

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:01.608
- No!
- Door's locked.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.909
Don't look!

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:06.213
- Oh, my god.
- Don't look at it.

01:28:06.215 --> 01:28:09.483
- Don't look at it!
- It's not "it." It's a "her."

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.733
Neither men nor women
will be able to resist me now.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.808
Feel my power.

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:41.481
I bring worlds to their knees
with desire,

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.684
and feed on their souls.

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:48.455
When it feels this good,

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:52.225
Who can possibly resist?

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:55.562
Me!

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:10.010
"Human on the outside,"
you said.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:13.747
The only flaw in your plan
is humans can be killed easily.

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.216
Jen, Jen!

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:19.986
Back to the
drawing board, bitch.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:57.057
You think we can get
our old apartment back?

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:10.404
So, I know it's been a while, but I'm
still feeling the effects of that house.

01:30:10.406 --> 01:30:13.840
Yeah, me too.

01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:17.911
Well, maybe tonight we can do something about
it, now that everything's back to normal.

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.283
I meant to tell you,

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.986
we may have a problem.

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:29.823
Not everything's back to normal.

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:38.198
It did that to you?

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.769
I think I can handle it.

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.479
Let's make a baby.

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:28.461
Trust me, you've made
the right decision.

01:34:28.463 --> 01:34:29.996
You two are gonna be so...

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.733
Just so happy here.
