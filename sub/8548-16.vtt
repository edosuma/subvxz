TIME TO WALK TWO MILES.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.737
HE PROBABLY
TOOK A SHORTCUT.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.142
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.011
OH, HARRIETTE,
I'M WORRIED.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.413
I MEAN WHAT IF HE RUNS
INTO A BEAR

12:26.479 --> 12:30.918
OR MOUNTAIN LION
OR WORSE?

12:30.984 --> 12:33.120
YOU KNOW, I ONCE
READ A STORY

12:33.186 --> 12:35.923
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE
IN THE WOODS--

12:35.989 --> 12:39.459
BIG, HAIRY, UGLY PEOPLE...

12:41.161 --> 12:42.562
WHO PREY ON
INNOCENT TOURISTS

12:42.629 --> 12:44.697
WHEN THEIR CARS
BREAK DOWN.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.867
WHEN THE POLICE
FOUND THE VICTIMS

12:46.934 --> 12:51.104
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
OF THEM BUT THEIR SHOES.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.307
AAH! IT'S THE UGLY PEOPLE!

12:54.374 --> 12:57.210
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.179
OPEN THE DOOR!

12:59.246 --> 13:00.447
OH, IT'S CARL.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.483
SORRY.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.118
YOU OKAY, BABY?

13:07.855 --> 13:11.058
CARL, WHERE'S
THE TOW TRUCK?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.394
THERE IS NO TOW TRUCK.
THE GAS STATION'S CLOSED.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.232
SO...THIS IS WHERE
I'M GOING TO DIE.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.302
I WANTED TO LIVE TO
SEE DARRYL TURN 40.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.172
IS THAT TOO MUCH
TO ASK FOR, CARL?

13:25.238 --> 13:28.475
I WANTED TO LIVE TO SEE
LITTLE RICHIE TURN ONE.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.845
LOOK, THERE WAS
A PHONE BOOTH.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.914
I CALLED
THE EMERGENCY ROAD SERVICE.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.584
I TOLD THEM OUR CAR
BROKE DOWN ON HIGHWAY 180.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.287
WE'RE EASY TO SPOT BECAUSE WE'RE
CLOSE TO THE GAS STATION

13:40.353 --> 13:42.890
RIGHT UNDERNEATH
THE HIGHWAY 180 SIGN.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.557
BRILLIANT, CARL.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.862
THAT HIGHWAY 180 SIGN
IS WHAT SAVED US.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.946
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHERE IS THAT TOW TRUCK?

14:06.013 --> 14:07.948
IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.617
THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING FOR HELP.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.252
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.455
DON'T GO, CARL.
WE NEED YOUR BODY HEAT.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.157
OH, MAMA.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.796
I DON'T GET THIS.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.165
I GAVE OUR LOCATION.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.001
I SAID WE'RE ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

14:28.068 --> 14:31.371
RIGHT UNDERNEATH
THE HIGHWAY 180 SIGN.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.472
CARL!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.640
WHAT?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.909
THE SIGN SAYS 130.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.153
DIDN'T I SAY 130?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.855
NO. YOU SAID 180, CARL.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.158
I GUESS
THAT EXPLAINS THE DELAY.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.393
LOOK, DON'T TELL
THE OTHERS.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.461
YOU KNOW I HATE

14:54.527 --> 14:57.897
LOOKING LIKE A FOOL
IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.699
FINE.
GET IN THE CAR,

14:59.766 --> 15:02.069
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.045
WELL? WHAT WERE
YOU TWO DOING OUT THERE?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.215
CARL GAVE THE WRONG
HIGHWAY NUMBER.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.450
WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.087
HARRIETTE, THEY REALLY
HAD TO BEAT THAT

15:20.153 --> 15:21.921
OUT OF YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

15:24.191 --> 15:27.260
WELL, WE ARE
IN TROUBLE NOW.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.597
WE ARE IN MORE TROUBLE
THAN YOU KNOW.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.764
JUST BEFORE
WE LEFT,

15:31.831 --> 15:35.435
I DRANK A QUART
OF PRUNE JUICE.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.607
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.442
IT'S A UFO!

15:45.478 --> 15:46.879
OH, IT'S NOT A UFO.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.582
IT'S
THE HIGHWAY PATROL.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
FOLKS?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.086
GOOD EVENING, OFFICER.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.323
WE SEEM TO BE HAVING
A LITTLE CAR TROUBLE.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.025
WHERE ARE
YOU FOLKS HEADED?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.859
WE'RE GOING
TO SHEBOYGAN.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.161
ON THIS ROAD?

16:01.228 --> 16:04.964
NOBODY TAKES THIS ROAD
TO SHEBOYGAN.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.601
SEE, HARRIETTE?
I'M THE ONLY ONE

16:08.668 --> 16:10.103
WHO KNOWS
THIS SHORTCUT.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.683
GET BACK.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.985
OOH, COME ON NOW.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.990
WATCH IT!

16:37.030 --> 16:38.098
WHO ARE YOU?

16:38.165 --> 16:41.201
I'M STEVE.
I LIVE NEXT DOOR.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.136
ANY GIRLS WITH YOU?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.372
YEAH, IN MY
BACK POCKET.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.109
GET OUT OF MY FACE.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.912
HI, EDDIE,
HAVING A PARTY?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.547
WHAT TIPPED YOU OFF?

16:54.614 --> 16:58.118
THE 3 MILLION KIDS
DANCING IN MY LIVING ROOM?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.919
GOOD ONE, EDDIE.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.623
LAURA, MY PRINCESS.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.432
HI, LAURA.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.801
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.736
FINE, THEN LET'S DANCE.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.377
AAH!

17:24.444 --> 17:27.247
HELLO.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.082
HEY, YOU!
GET OFF THAT PIANO BENCH!

17:29.149 --> 17:31.251
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

17:31.851 --> 17:32.885
YO! HEY, HEY,

17:32.952 --> 17:34.554
YOU EDDIE?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.755
YEAH, WHY?

17:35.822 --> 17:38.125
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR WATER PRESSURE.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.129
WHOO, EDDIE,
GREAT PARTY.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.632
SMILE.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.601
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.603
IT'S CALLED BLACKMAIL.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.910
LAURA, HOW DID
THIS EVER HAPPEN?

17:57.977 --> 18:02.549
STAY COOL. AS LONG AS A FIGHT
DOESN'T BREAK OUT, WE'RE OKAY.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.985
FIGHT!
FIGHT IN THE KITCHEN!

18:06.052 --> 18:07.287
FIGHT IN THE KITCHEN!

18:08.555 --> 18:11.124
END ZONE?
YOU WERE OUT OF BOUNDS.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.692
IT WAS A TOUCHDOWN!

18:12.759 --> 18:13.660
OH, RIGHT!

18:13.726 --> 18:15.828
EXCUSE ME, FELLOWS.
EXCUSE ME.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.096
THANK YOU.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.398
IT WASN'T THAT PLAY

18:18.465 --> 18:20.167
THAT COST
YOU THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.068
IT WAS YOUR FREE SAFETY.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.503
THE GUY'S A FEBE.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.205
HIS MAN
WAS OPEN ALL DAY.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.708
HE COULDN'T COVER
HIS HEAD WITH HIS HAT.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.344
THAT FEBE YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT WAS ME!

18:31.411 --> 18:33.780
OOH!
OOH!
OOH!

18:36.383 --> 18:39.786
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY DAD
WHO SAID THAT.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.321
HE'S A VERY LARGE MAN

18:41.388 --> 18:44.457
WHO'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

18:44.524 --> 18:48.261
YOU MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE.
YOU KNOW THAT?

18:48.328 --> 18:51.331
BY ANY CHANCE, IS THAT
SOMETHING YOU ENJOY?

18:52.399 --> 18:53.600
STUFF HIM SOMEWHERE!

18:53.666 --> 18:55.168
HEY, COME ON, GUYS.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.637
NO, GLASSES, GLASSES.

18:57.704 --> 19:02.575
PLEASE, GUYS.
I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY, LAURA?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.479
LET'S PLAY THAT DOWN
OVER AGAIN.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.480
ANY TIME.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.548
LET'S GO.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.352
HEY!

19:12.419 --> 19:13.620
THIS IS MY HOUSE,

19:13.686 --> 19:17.156
AND I WILL NOT ALLOW
FOOTBALL IN MY KITCHEN!

19:17.224 --> 19:18.258
SHUT UP.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.693
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.128
HERE'S THE BALL.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.131
HEY, THAT'S MY MOTHER'S
GRAVY BOAT!

19:25.198 --> 19:26.633
GO!

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
SET!

19:27.734 --> 19:28.701
HUT 1!

19:28.768 --> 19:30.337
HUT 2!
HUT! HUT! HUT!

19:35.542 --> 19:36.809
NICE SNAP!

19:51.958 --> 19:53.726
OH, WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

19:53.793 --> 19:58.431
IT WAS AS MUCH MY FAULT
AS IT WAS YOURS.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.666
YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

19:59.732 --> 20:01.434
YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
NO MATTER WHAT,

20:01.501 --> 20:03.403
WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.875
DAD!

20:10.777 --> 20:12.379
IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.851
LOOK, DAD, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

20:18.918 --> 20:21.220
BUT IT'S NOT
AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.855
PASS IT! I'M OPEN!

20:22.922 --> 20:24.257
[GLASS BREAKS]

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
MY KITCHEN!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.461
MOVE!
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

20:28.528 --> 20:32.131
ALRIGHT,
THIS PARTY IS OVER!

20:32.198 --> 20:34.100
EVERYBODY OUT. LET'S GO.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.234
COME ON, LET'S GO.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.337
COME ON, LET'S GO.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.373
YOU STAY.

20:47.547 --> 20:52.285
HARRIETTE, THE BATHTUB
IS FULL OF GREEN JELL-O.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.887
WHAT IN THE WORLD
WENT ON HERE?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.155
YOU'LL SEE.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.725
I'VE GOT PICTURES
OF EVERYTHING.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.069
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS, EDWARD.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.203
I BACKED YOU UP.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.641
I TRUSTED YOU,
AND YOU HAVE A PARTY.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.180
THEY THREW A GRAVY BOAT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.715
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.817
THEY WERE PLAYING
FOOTBALL, DAD.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.089
LET'S KILL HIM, CARL.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.325
WE CAN HAVE MORE CHILDREN.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.627
HARRIETTE, IT'S OKAY.
HARRIETTE, HARRIETTE.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.962
HARRIETTE, IT'S ALRIGHT.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.298
UH, COME ON, JUDY.
YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR THIS.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.738
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HAVE A PARTY.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.541
I JUST LET RODNEY IN
WITH SOME PIZZAS.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.111
SON, I TOLD YOU NOT
TO HAVE ANYONE OVER

21:52.178 --> 21:53.913
WHILE WE WERE GONE.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.416
YOU PROMISED ME
THAT YOU WOULDN'T.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.784
YOU BROKE YOUR PROMISE.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.753
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING
IN THE HOUSE.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.658
WE DON'T MAKE RULES
UP FOR OUR HEALTH.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.496
THERE'S A REASON WE DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO HAVE ANYONE OVER.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.964
YOU FOUND OUT
THE HARD WAY.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.065
I'M SORRY.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.402
ME, TOO.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.704
I GUESS THIS MEANS
WE'RE GROUNDED.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.806
INTO DUST.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.447
I THINK WE'RE TOO UPSET

22:27.514 --> 22:29.382
TO DEAL WITH THIS
TONIGHT.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.983
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
TOMORROW.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.719
YOU TWO, TO BED.

22:40.827 --> 22:44.531
I'M GOING TO FIND THE OTHER HALF
OF MY GRAVY BOAT.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.771
BOY, WHAT A NIGHT.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.641
[HUMMING]

23:08.821 --> 23:11.390
PARTY OF THE YEAR,
CARL.

23:11.458 --> 23:15.094
PARTY OF THE YEAR.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.629
CHEESEBALL?
