WEBVTT

00:37.287 --> 00:39.471
<i>There is</i>
<i> an old, oblique scar...</i>

00:41.342 --> 00:43.142
<i> three-quarter inches...</i>

00:44.578 --> 00:46.545
<i> at the mid third</i>
<i> of the upper lip.</i>

00:47.715 --> 00:48.614
<i>Ooh!</i>

00:50.901 --> 00:53.185
- The scar ends at the
anterior of the hairline.

00:53.187 --> 00:57.156
There is a flattening of the
prominence at the junction

00:57.158 --> 00:59.158
of the bony portion
of the nasal bone

00:59.160 --> 01:00.826
and the cartilaginous septum.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.765
Extending across the upper
lip to the left nostril

01:06.767 --> 01:10.069
is an odd, irregular scar
seven-eighths by one-eighths

01:10.071 --> 01:13.672
that ends at the
mucocutaneous border.

01:16.210 --> 01:16.809
- Uh!

01:36.564 --> 01:38.130
No goal!

01:38.132 --> 01:40.199
- Suture cross
scars are present.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.234
<i> Scar ends at the</i>
<i> lower right lip.</i>

01:46.474 --> 01:48.440
<i> A vertical linear scar</i>

01:48.442 --> 01:50.109
on the right upper lip

01:50.111 --> 01:52.511
<i> looks to have</i>
<i> come from youth.</i>

02:00.488 --> 02:02.605
Come on, guys!

02:02.606 --> 02:04.723
<i>Winter white</i>
<i> light like a sword in the sun.</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:08.360
Terry, keep your
fingers off the screen!

02:08.362 --> 02:11.163
<i> Warm nights under quilts;</i>

02:11.165 --> 02:13.265
<i> whispers back and forth;</i>

02:13.267 --> 02:15.601
<i> saves and misses.</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:17.536
How'd you know
he was gonna shoot it high?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.638
'Cause it looked like he
was going to shoot it--

02:19.640 --> 02:21.774
- Terry, you got to know.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.909
The goalie's the punching bag if
you lose. And hero if you win.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.178
<i> I'd tell Mitch he was mental</i>

02:26.180 --> 02:27.546
<i> playing goal.</i>

02:27.548 --> 02:29.348
- Anybody's girl would
rather be with you.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.416
- Hey, wait. Wait, which girls?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.585
- Uh!

02:33.587 --> 02:34.887
- Terry!

02:36.557 --> 02:38.590
<i>You all right?</i>

02:40.728 --> 02:43.896
- Buffalo's getting
a team next season.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.601
Buffalo.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.172
Spent a month
there one night.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.285
<i> He's in there.</i>

03:06.287 --> 03:07.519
<i> Red!?</i>

03:09.423 --> 03:10.756
<i>Game's gone now.</i>

03:10.758 --> 03:13.759
I hardly ever
watch it anymore.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.395
Cheerleaders.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.867
Kids who train
in a boxing ring.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.236
What's that got to
do with a puck and a net?

03:24.238 --> 03:25.904
<i> It's his first in nine.</i>

03:27.657 --> 03:29.407
<i> And the game's all</i>
<i> tied up one-one.</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:32.377
- What was it I was
going on about?

03:32.379 --> 03:36.481
Oh. You know, an athlete
used to live in the moment.

03:37.751 --> 03:41.353
It's in my memories that I live.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.224
Oh. Terry Sawchuk.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.260
I remember Terry Sawchuk.

03:48.262 --> 03:52.231
Ah, how could you get
a handle on a guy like him?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.268
Yeah.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.242
Sawchuk.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.811
Even his name,

04:05.813 --> 04:08.447
it means hockey to me.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.316
<i> And, uh, when I'm</i>

04:11.318 --> 04:15.354
<i> picking my team in</i>
<i> the afterlife? Hm.</i>

04:15.623 --> 04:19.391
He'll be backstopping
us for sure.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.995
Would he know that?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.764
<i>Are we on yet?</i>

04:25.766 --> 04:28.217
<i> Hello, Canada!</i>

04:28.218 --> 04:30.669
<i> And hockey fans in the</i>
<i>United States and Newfoundland.</i>

04:30.671 --> 04:31.603
<i>Sawchuk?</i>

04:31.605 --> 04:33.905
Jeez.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.610
Why don't you ask me
something a little easier?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.978
Hm?

04:41.615 --> 04:44.416
You gotta stay
low, stay forward;

04:44.418 --> 04:47.786
see the shot before
it leaves the stick.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.630
Come.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.666
Nah. Don't let
that dog in this house!

05:00.668 --> 05:01.700
She's not having
puppies in here.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.435
- But...

05:26.927 --> 05:30.662
I'm taking Mitch
with me to the plant.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.100
- Louis, Bob say he has
scouts coming to look at him

05:35.102 --> 05:36.535
any day now.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.969
- Yeah and this winter
we'll burn the floorboards

05:37.971 --> 05:39.871
to stay alive.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.674
- Take Terry.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.843
- Boys'll crucify Terry.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.112
- Why? What do you mean?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.884
- I mean I need Mitch.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.727
- Who's going to take care
of that cord of wood, huh?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.138
- Lady?

06:22.783 --> 06:24.416
Lady?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.489
Come on, girl. What's wrong?

06:33.694 --> 06:36.161
You're okay. You're just frozen.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.396
<i> You're gonna wake up.</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:39.531
<i> Come on!</i>

06:39.533 --> 06:42.768
<i> Just frozen. Please, come on.</i>

06:42.936 --> 06:45.904
<i> Breathe, breathe.</i>
<i> Come on. Come on.</i>

06:45.906 --> 06:47.973
- Terry?
- Come on.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.409
- What are you doing?

06:50.411 --> 06:51.743
<i> - They're okay.</i>

06:51.745 --> 06:54.079
<i> They're just frozen.</i>

06:54.081 --> 06:55.881
<i> They're gonna wake up!</i>

07:01.488 --> 07:03.054
No!

07:04.491 --> 07:06.758
- They're dead and
a good thing, too.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.594
We would'a had to drown 'em.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.563
- Huh.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.531
- Now, get 'em out of here
before your mother sees 'em.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.203
<i>Think God</i>
<i> lets dogs in heaven?</i>

07:18.205 --> 07:20.038
<i>If heaven doesn't</i>
<i> have pups running around,</i>

07:20.040 --> 07:21.606
<i> I don't wanna go there.</i>

07:23.076 --> 07:25.911
- In heaven, I'll be
as good a goalie as you.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.846
- You think too much, Terry.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.048
All you have to do
is stop the puck.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.184
Stay low and stay forward.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.686
Like last night.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.187
<i> Jimmy Day's coming</i>
<i> at me at full speed</i>

07:35.189 --> 07:37.088
<i> and lets fly a shot</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:38.557
and it's a 100 miles an hour,

07:38.559 --> 07:40.225
definitely close to
that, and I'm thinking

07:40.227 --> 07:42.361
stay low, stay forward

07:42.362 --> 07:44.496
and I see it before
he lets the shot fly.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.131
<i> And it's a bullet.</i>
It's in the glove.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.599
No rebound.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.066
You should've seen his
face! He thought he had me

07:49.069 --> 07:51.136
and that'll teach him
to bring his girl to a game.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.838
I feel bad for him.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.639
Who wants a soda?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.640
Ah...

08:00.948 --> 08:02.647
- Hey.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.518
Mitch?

08:08.655 --> 08:09.821
Mitch?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.524
<i> Aw, get in the swing.</i>

08:18.632 --> 08:20.799
- Kettleman says the body's
gonna stay in storage

08:20.801 --> 08:22.701
until the ground thaws.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.009
Stop it.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.638
<i>There's</i>
<i> something like a question</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:00.939
<i> in the air</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:03.875
<i> that will linger from now on.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.810
"Take Terry.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.312
<i> I need Mitch."</i>

09:35.208 --> 09:38.076
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

09:40.714 --> 09:42.280
Dad!

10:00.601 --> 10:03.268
<i>- All those nights</i>
<i>- I'd hear him in his sleep.</i>

10:03.270 --> 10:04.970
- Ah!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.671
<i>Stay low.</i>
<i> Stay forward.</i>

10:06.673 --> 10:08.673
<i> Forget the names they sing</i>
<i> at you through the screen.</i>

10:08.675 --> 10:10.075
- Ah!

10:10.077 --> 10:12.177
<i> Such preparedness.</i>

10:12.179 --> 10:14.012
<i> I'd lie awake and think.</i>

10:14.014 --> 10:15.780
- Ah!

10:18.185 --> 10:20.619
<i>And so</i>
<i> I got accustomed to the view</i>

10:20.621 --> 10:21.753
<i> from here.</i>

10:24.324 --> 10:26.725
<i> You watch them come</i>
<i> at you in waves.</i>

10:27.294 --> 10:28.393
<i> You watch 'em fly away.</i>

10:28.395 --> 10:30.245
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

10:30.246 --> 10:32.096
<i>A brief</i>
<i> flicker of relief</i>

10:32.099 --> 10:33.365
<i> but they'll be back.</i>

10:33.367 --> 10:37.302
<i> To knock on the gate</i>
<i> one more time.</i>

10:37.304 --> 10:39.237
<i> I could leave.</i>

10:39.239 --> 10:41.373
<i> But where would I go?</i>

10:42.743 --> 10:45.877
<i> This is my only home.</i>

10:48.081 --> 10:50.649
- Bob! Jack Adams.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.721
Listen, about that goalie
you're hiding up there

10:56.723 --> 10:58.990
in the frozen north,
I'm hearing good things.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.659
Suit him up with the
Spitfires, will ya'?

11:00.661 --> 11:03.028
Time to see what young
Mr. Sawchuk can do.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.729
<i>- Okay. Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.065
<i> - Well, I'll certainly</i>
<i> get onto that.</i>

11:07.067 --> 11:08.833
- Lil!

11:08.835 --> 11:11.903
Is there no way to make
this water a bit hotter?

11:12.673 --> 11:15.040
<i>All aboard!</i>

11:17.778 --> 11:20.445
- We'll be doing without
'cause I'm giving that to you.

11:20.947 --> 11:24.082
Think about that before
you piss it all away.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.319
- I'm gonna turn this
into bags of money, Mom.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.356
I'm going to send it all
back home on this very train.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.725
<i> - Don't be proud.</i>

11:35.195 --> 11:36.795
Uh...

11:36.797 --> 11:38.363
Go on.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.366
You'd miss your train standing
a foot away from it, you would.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.778
<i>For my money,</i>

11:53.780 --> 11:55.947
<i> Jack Adams</i>
<i> wanted to bring Terry</i>

11:55.949 --> 11:58.817
<i> down to Windsor to get</i>
<i> a glimpse across the river</i>

11:58.819 --> 12:01.319
at the Detroit skyline.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.195
Because he was known
to do things like that.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.097
They say he did the
same thing to Harry Lumley

12:12.099 --> 12:13.131
a few years earlier.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.165
<i> At the time,</i>

12:14.167 --> 12:16.801
teams had only one goalie

12:16.803 --> 12:18.937
One sweater per team.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.373
Detroit had Lumley and he'd
just won them the Stanley Cup.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.176
<i> - Hey, Burnsie, Burnsie!</i>

12:25.178 --> 12:28.079
- No one shuts the
door like this man!

12:29.216 --> 12:32.217
No one shuts
the door like Lumley!

12:36.857 --> 12:39.824
- Mr. Adams! You had a lot of
skeptics questioning how you

12:39.826 --> 12:41.059
<i>put the team together this year.</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:42.227
Bet you felt the pressure.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.929
Bet ya' feel like
a clever dog now!

12:47.968 --> 12:50.869
- I'm not the one
out there on the ice.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.820
Sometimes the sports desk
gets it right.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.124
I am the clever dog.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.327
<i>Harry Lumley</i>
<i> has traded his goalie stick</i>

13:16.329 --> 13:18.897
<i> for a pair of crutches</i>
<i> tonight. He'll be okay.</i>

13:18.899 --> 13:21.366
<i> The question is</i>
<i> will Detroit be okay?</i>

13:21.368 --> 13:23.334
<i> We're hearing good things</i>
<i> about this kid from Winnipeg,</i>

13:23.336 --> 13:24.536
<i> Terry Sawchuk.</i>

13:28.441 --> 13:30.275
<i>Hey, Lumley!</i>

13:30.277 --> 13:32.811
His head's too
big for your sweater.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.114
- Hope you figure that out
before you get in front

13:36.116 --> 13:37.849
<i> of the net, kid.</i>

13:40.453 --> 13:43.555
- Lumley, you're like his mom.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.524
- You get that first shot,
kid, you'll be fine.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.159
Yep, there he is.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.862
Who's game you
gonna play today, son?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.566
- Yours.
- Yours.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.335
- Mine.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.203
At our level,
right off the top.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.006
We're gonna grind these
sons of bitches down, boys!

14:02.008 --> 14:04.008
Let's go, Red Wings. Let's go!

14:04.010 --> 14:05.143
- Open the door!

14:05.145 --> 14:06.377
<i>There we go.</i>

14:06.379 --> 14:08.880
<i>Goalie goes first!</i>

14:08.882 --> 14:10.215
<i>Hup!</i>

14:12.152 --> 14:13.284
<i>Go!</i>

14:25.398 --> 14:26.531
<i>Up, up, up!</i>

14:31.471 --> 14:33.805
<i>Huh.</i>

14:33.806 --> 14:36.140
<i> It seems Mr. Sawchuk</i>
<i> has a style all his own.</i>

14:43.516 --> 14:45.917
<i> Boston scores!</i>

14:46.920 --> 14:48.052
- You paid three large for him?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.321
- I got it down to
two in the end. Yes.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.891
- Well, I don't see
what all the fuss is about.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.894
- I promise not to tell anyone
you said that.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.528
<i>Don't trade</i>
<i> Lumley yet!</i>

14:57.530 --> 14:59.998
<i>The whiz</i>
<i> kid misses the first shot.</i>

15:00.000 --> 15:04.102
<i> He's really got to look at</i>
<i> his stance in the net there.</i>

15:04.971 --> 15:07.005
- Okay, now listen, kid:

15:07.007 --> 15:09.574
this is no different
from the minors. All right?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.911
Just bigger pay cheques
and better women.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.680
You like women, don't ya'?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.286
- Yeah.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.521
- It's like if
we were brothers.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.110
<i>Yup, yup.</i>

15:48.014 --> 15:50.515
<i> Boston's got the puck.</i>

15:50.517 --> 15:53.184
<i> They're on the attack again.</i>

15:53.186 --> 15:55.353
<i> Ferguson shoots.</i>
<i> Sawchuk stops the puck!</i>

16:07.467 --> 16:10.201
- Yeah, they had a few, uh,
a few chances in the third.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.704
Uh, but we kept in it.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.606
<i> The players up here, they</i>
<i>don't try the same trick twice.</i>

16:15.608 --> 16:17.542
I learned that much.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.344
But, uh, mistakes like that,

16:19.346 --> 16:20.979
they cost me a
couple goals tonight

16:20.981 --> 16:23.114
and I won't let the same
thing happen on Wednesday.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.753
Oh, uh, either one
of you have a nickel

16:28.755 --> 16:31.289
so I could call
my mom?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.995
<i> Holy</i>
<i> Shinola,</i> Louis.

You're Detroit's new goalie.

Mr. Terry Sawchuk.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.341
I can't afford 'em.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.110
- Now, they pay
you, don't they?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.546
- What? Uh, yeah.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.614
But then I pay my landlord

18:03.616 --> 18:05.383
and then the rest
goes to my parents.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.152
- Good man.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.687
But you're going to
have to look sharp

18:09.689 --> 18:11.756
<i> now that you're</i>

18:11.758 --> 18:14.158
<i> I'll let you pay</i> two dollars

18:14.160 --> 18:15.660
You'll have 'em
paid off by January.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.612
- Janu-? Well,

18:17.613 --> 18:19.563
they won't do me much good
in the dead of winter.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.833
- Nonsense. You wear
them out today.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.202
- You'd let me do that?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.270
- If you stiff me, I know
where to find you, don't I?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.772
- Stopping those
dirty French pucks!

18:27.774 --> 18:30.775
- Yeah. I, uh...

18:30.777 --> 18:32.810
Yeah. I sure hope so.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.079
- Now, son:

18:35.080 --> 18:37.347
in Detroit we expect you to
bring more than just hope.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.688
- I'll try 'em on.
- All right, all right.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.123
- Thank you.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.591
Nice to meet you.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.426
- Nice to meet you, Terry.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.438
Fancy shoes.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.696
Making me work
for my tips today.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.333
- I gotta break in
these shoes, I guess.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.902
- Hm.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.506
- Stew, huh?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.275
Is that going to be
as good as my mother's

19:37.277 --> 19:38.709
Ukrainian dumplings?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.912
- I don't think I can
serve you in here.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.214
- Well, why not?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.782
- You look like
a hockey player.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.917
- I am.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.385
- Well, if you played
for Detroit,

19:47.387 --> 19:48.352
I'd have noticed you before.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.854
- I'm Detroit's new goalie.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.956
- Hm.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.258
Then I guess I'll serve you.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.594
I just won't
get too attached.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.331
As for the dumplings,
I've never tried 'em.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.301
But I bring 'em home to Bobby
some nights and he's a big fan.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.540
Stew like his Mama's.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.425
<i> The Montreal-Detroit rivalry</i>

<i>with seconds left on the clock.</i>

20:54.887 --> 20:56.487
<i>It's in! The ref calls it a goal</i>

<i> and Montreal ekes out a win</i>

20:58.491 --> 21:00.558
<i> with Detroit</i>
<i> nipping at their heels.</i>

21:10.737 --> 21:13.404
<i> Montreal still</i>
<i> holds the better record</i>

21:13.406 --> 21:15.706
<i> and no one hates losing</i>
<i> more than Jack Adams.</i>

21:16.876 --> 21:19.610

<i> Take 'er easy, Jack!</i>

21:29.756 --> 21:30.888
Hey!

21:30.890 --> 21:33.057
What are you so
happy about? We lost.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.625
- I know, but I have

21:34.627 --> 21:36.694
a special friend
supposed to visit me tonight.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.928
- Oh, yeah? What's his name?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.563
That's his name.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.966
- Hey! Uncle.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.668
<i> Hey, don't mind Boiter.</i>

21:43.670 --> 21:46.037
He's gotta touch
every player after a game.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.929
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

21:54.930 --> 21:56.880
Gordie says if you want to touch
him, it's gotta be his balls.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.050
- Get off me!
- Come on, come on!

21:59.052 --> 22:00.951
<i>- Get off me!</i>
<i>- Cool down.</i>

22:00.953 --> 22:02.386
- Hey, uh, snappy shoes!

22:02.388 --> 22:03.821
- Oh, yeah.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.389
- You must've
shelled out for 'em.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.994
<i>- Oop. Maybe pull it?</i>
<i>- Come on; little pull.</i>

22:09.996 --> 22:11.412
<i> Yeah, pull it,</i>
<i> pull hard. Harder.</i>

22:11.413 --> 22:12.829
<i> Come on. There you go.</i>
<i> That's it. That's it.</i>

22:12.832 --> 22:14.432
- Whoever did this
is paying for it!

22:14.434 --> 22:16.767
- C'mon, Terry. It's just fun.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.994
- So, how are you
settling in with the boys?

22:51.971 --> 22:53.504
There you go, son.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.639
- Thank you.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.375
- There won't be
anything in your life

22:57.377 --> 23:00.111
after like belonging to a team.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.980
Take it from a
land of experience.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.883
<i> No. Where does this sort</i>
<i> of sacrifice</i>

23:05.885 --> 23:08.853
<i> and loyalty</i>
<i> exist anymore, right?</i>

23:09.622 --> 23:11.922
Nah. It's an ancient game

23:11.924 --> 23:14.058
with ancient laws.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.761
But, God, I love it.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.931
Mm. Going to have to get you
some new shoes, I see.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.068
The fellas got a bit
of a sense of humour there.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.571
- Oh, no. Mr. Adams, I--

23:27.573 --> 23:29.774
- Mr. Sawchuk, if there's
one thing I know in this world

23:29.776 --> 23:31.075
to be true:

23:31.077 --> 23:33.644
you are worth the investment.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.651
- Thank you.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.886
- Please.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.824
Oh, that really
is nice on the toes.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.626
- Yeah?

23:49.895 --> 23:51.161
Pronovost, tough
as a bag of batteries.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.963
He gets the puck to me,
I see Delvecchio open...

23:52.965 --> 23:54.999
- You get a chance,
you gotta make the best of it.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.901
- Of course.
- And then Sawchuk.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.669
<i>Yeah. Then</i>
<i> Terry with the save.</i>

23:58.671 --> 23:59.971
- Mm.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.272
Sawchuk,
tonight, it was like...

24:01.273 --> 24:02.573
Hey!

24:02.575 --> 24:03.974
Great game.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.729
<i>Speech.</i>

24:07.730 --> 24:09.447
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Speech, speech!</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:11.215
<i>Uh,</i>

24:11.217 --> 24:13.684
I thought it was a
team effort. Um...

24:13.686 --> 24:15.553
I thought we really took
it to 'em tonight,

24:15.555 --> 24:17.188
we played a full 60 minutes

24:17.190 --> 24:18.956
and, uh,

24:18.958 --> 24:20.958
I'm really looking forward to
the playoffs, that's for sure.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.710
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:22.711 --> 24:24.461
- Mr. Sawchuk, everyone's
saying you got the skills

24:24.464 --> 24:26.797
to become one of the
greatest goalies in history.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.655
- Thank you.

24:34.656 --> 24:36.239
<i>- In my experience...</i>
<i>- That's it.</i>

24:36.242 --> 24:37.842
<i>Good game.</i>

24:39.712 --> 24:41.979
- Get a load
of all that, huh?

24:43.149 --> 24:44.982
Everybody loves a winner.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.620
I need eight more
of them to get the cup.

24:49.622 --> 24:52.590
<i> Can you get me eight wins?</i>

24:53.926 --> 24:55.125
- Okay.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.994
- All right.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.767
- Ah!
- Jesus! Oi!

25:14.614 --> 25:16.264
Ahh!

25:16.265 --> 25:17.915
<i> Amazing save by Sawchuk!</i>

25:17.917 --> 25:20.584
<i> Detroit is one period</i>
<i> away from sweeping Toronto</i>

25:20.586 --> 25:22.686
<i> out of the playoffs.</i>

25:22.688 --> 25:24.889
<i> A date with Montreal</i>
<i> within reach!</i>

25:26.626 --> 25:27.925
<i>Jesus! Holy cow.</i>

25:27.927 --> 25:29.126
- How's he doing?
We need this one.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.861
- No, Jack. It's
his elbow again.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.213
The doc says he needs surgery.

25:32.214 --> 25:33.564
- Surgery? Get off him.
- Yeah.

25:33.566 --> 25:34.999
How you feelin', son?

25:35.001 --> 25:36.768
Huh?

25:36.769 --> 25:38.536
Look at that face.
Tough as nails.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.571
I knew it the first
time I set eyes on him.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.973
You need this one, Jack.
Toughness! Heart!

25:42.975 --> 25:44.775
This is your man, I said.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.044
- If he goes out there,
it's not gonna heal proper.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.779
- You know they popped
out his eye one time

25:48.781 --> 25:50.180
when he played in the minors?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.982
Took a stick blade
right to the eye.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.685
They just patched it up
and popped it back in.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.087
<i> No. Someone plays</i>
<i> with that kind of heart</i>

25:57.089 --> 25:59.256
and that kind of
sacrifice for his team?

25:59.258 --> 26:02.026
That's someone that you
do not send to the hospital

26:02.028 --> 26:03.627
unless he says he needs to go!

26:03.629 --> 26:04.328
Huh? You ready to play.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.696
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.248
- You ready to
win this game?

26:07.249 --> 26:08.799
- I can go back in. I'm good.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.301
<i>Let's go. Let's go!</i>
<i> Let's go! All right!</i>

26:10.303 --> 26:11.686
- Ha. Hoo.

26:11.687 --> 26:13.070
<i>Upsy-doodle. Yeah.</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:15.139
<i> You wish you had</i>
<i> this kind of heart!</i>

26:15.141 --> 26:17.008
Okay.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.876
<i>Out on the ice,</i>
<i> with the game on the line,</i>

26:18.878 --> 26:20.878
<i> that's where I was alive.</i>

26:20.880 --> 26:23.614
<i> When you saw those words</i>
<i> up over the arena doors</i>

26:23.616 --> 26:25.182
<i> "Hockey tonight",</i>

26:25.184 --> 26:28.586
<i> man, they picked up your step.</i>

26:28.588 --> 26:30.354
<i> They told you life was good,</i>
<i> the woman with you</i>

26:30.356 --> 26:32.089
<i> was just the right woman,</i>

26:32.091 --> 26:34.758
<i>whichever joint you were heading</i>
<i> for was just the place to be</i>

26:34.760 --> 26:36.193
<i> before the game.</i>

26:36.195 --> 26:37.995
<i> Detroit leaves Montreal</i>

26:37.997 --> 26:41.231
<i>after taking the first two games</i>
<i> of the Stanley Cup finals!</i>

26:41.233 --> 26:43.634
- That's three games
in the books, boys.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.369
We got Montreal
on their heels.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.905
But I'll tell ya': the game
that ends a team's season

26:47.907 --> 26:50.240
is the hardest
one to win. Yeah.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.009
They're against the
ropes. Gettin' desperate.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.911
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Where's Terry?

26:53.913 --> 26:56.280
- Mmm. I-I think-

26:56.282 --> 26:58.382
I think he left.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.184
- It's not a joke.
Where is he?

27:00.186 --> 27:02.186
- Didn't he, uh, didn't he
mention getting a haircut?

27:02.188 --> 27:03.954
- No, no. I think he
talked about, like,

27:03.956 --> 27:05.422
an ingrown toenail or something.

27:05.423 --> 27:06.889
- Ingrown toenail.
- Yeah. I think...

27:06.892 --> 27:09.293
- It's not funny, you guys!

27:09.295 --> 27:11.829
Fuck you guys!

27:11.831 --> 27:13.263
You know, it's on you too!

27:13.265 --> 27:15.666
I have a shit game,
we all have a shit game.

27:15.668 --> 27:16.767
- Yeah.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.335
- Right?
<i>- Right.</i>

27:18.336 --> 27:19.902
<i>- Can you read?</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

27:19.905 --> 27:23.307
- He better be in
the trainer's room.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.711
- Is he gone? Let's
get the fuck outta here.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.146
- Just be quiet, okay?
- Yeah.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.382
Come on. Go-go-go-go!

27:34.420 --> 27:36.120
<i>Terry. Quit it.</i>

27:36.122 --> 27:38.822
You're gonna burn a
hole right through her.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.692
- What? You like her?

27:41.694 --> 27:43.372
- No.
- Which one?

27:43.373 --> 27:45.051
- No. Marcel.
- Right there?

27:45.052 --> 27:46.730
- No, no, no, no. She has a
boyfriend, Bobby, or something.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.166
- Hey! Excuse me.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.669
Yeah. Please.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.837
- Hay is for horses.
<i>- Oh.</i>

27:53.839 --> 27:55.673
- Oh. Okay, uh...

27:55.675 --> 27:57.141
Pardonnez moi, Mademoiselle.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.710
But, um, may I bother
you for a second?

27:59.712 --> 28:01.245
Do you know who this is?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.381
You're looking at our
ticket to the top right there.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.282
- I'm working.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.917
- Okay, pardon me.

28:06.919 --> 28:09.420
We were just wondering if, um...

28:09.422 --> 28:11.355
Bobby's still
in the picture?

28:12.958 --> 28:14.925
- Bobby's still
in the picture.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.961
Only has three legs now
since the tractor ran over him.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.064
Thank you so
much for asking.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.334
Bobby's my dog.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.403
Okay. You're in!

28:26.405 --> 28:27.682
- I'm so sorry.
I don't know...

28:27.683 --> 28:28.960
<i>Okay.</i>
<i> So, he lives at...</i>

28:28.961 --> 28:30.238
- No, Marcel. No, I...
<i>- Yes.</i>

28:30.242 --> 28:31.809
He lives at
67 Military Road.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.876
- I-I...

28:34.780 --> 28:37.915
I do live there, though.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.150
Not with parents, or anything.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.785
- Wh-?

28:41.787 --> 28:44.788
No, no! Wait, wait, wait.
She's not even gonna...

28:46.258 --> 28:47.725
It's game over.
You're gonna have to jerk it.

28:47.727 --> 28:48.910
- You're a fuckin' idiot.

28:48.911 --> 28:50.094
That was smooth.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.729
- Yeah.
- Really smooth.

28:51.731 --> 28:52.996
- Good job.
- Yeah? Yeah?

28:52.998 --> 28:54.364
Very smooth.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.527
Asshole.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.042
- Let's go out there
and take it, boys.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.944
- It's our game tonight.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.547
- Full energy right
off the hop, boys.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.517
Gonna get to
our game: speed.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.185
You are going to
dump those pucks in deep.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.888
You will own
the neutral zone.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.556
No mercy.
No mercy.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.892
We will finish them off tonight.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.143
Who's ready?

29:56.144 --> 29:57.393
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

29:57.396 --> 29:58.495
- Yeah?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.397
Ukey,

30:00.399 --> 30:02.566
you stand on your head all
season. Tonight any different?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.401
- No different.
- No different.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.470
Pronovost! Ready to make
their lives miserable?

30:06.472 --> 30:08.238
Yes. Yeah.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.573
- How are you feeling, son?

30:09.575 --> 30:11.141
- Good, sir. Good.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.576
- Gordie,

30:12.577 --> 30:14.010
you ready to take another
walk around this block?

30:14.013 --> 30:15.345
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.847
- No matter what happens
in this building,

30:16.849 --> 30:19.016
you and I know,
we know the game is played

30:19.018 --> 30:20.317
between those
blood red posts.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.420
<i>All right, this is it.</i>
<i> Here we go.</i>

30:23.422 --> 30:26.857
<i> Nothin' else matters but</i>
<i> tonight, boys. Montreal?</i>

30:26.859 --> 30:29.326
<i> Montreal's got</i>
<i> nothin' on you!</i>

30:29.328 --> 30:31.595
Go, go!

30:36.101 --> 30:37.334
- Open the door.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.002
<i> Goalie goes first.</i>

30:46.011 --> 30:48.011
<i>You got the greatest goaltender</i>

30:48.013 --> 30:49.279
<i> in the league at one end.</i>

30:49.281 --> 30:51.348
<i> The kid. Sawchuk.</i>

30:51.350 --> 30:53.050
<i> Bearing down on him,</i>

30:53.052 --> 30:55.619
<i> the greatest goal scorer</i>
<i> in hockey history:</i>

30:55.621 --> 30:57.805
<i> Rocket Richard.</i>

30:57.806 --> 30:59.990
<i> This is one for the</i>
<i>history books, ladies and gents.</i>

30:59.992 --> 31:02.626
<i> Hold your families close.</i>
<i> Take the phone off the hook!</i>

31:02.628 --> 31:05.262
<i> Detroit could</i>
<i> win it all tonight.</i>

31:05.264 --> 31:08.899
<i>Welcome to the first elimination</i>
<i>game of the Stanley Cup finals!</i>

31:10.636 --> 31:13.503
<i>Out on the ice,</i>
<i> with the game on the line</i>

31:13.505 --> 31:15.305
<i> everyone depending on me.</i>

31:15.307 --> 31:17.541
<i> Half into an</i>
<i> animal crouch,</i>

31:17.543 --> 31:19.076
<i> like some poor bugger</i>

31:19.078 --> 31:21.879
<i> getting drilled</i>
<i> before a firing squad.</i>

31:23.449 --> 31:24.648
<i> Too late for last words.</i>

31:28.354 --> 31:29.353
Christ!

31:29.355 --> 31:30.954
- Dick, you gotta take it easy.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.990
- We've got three
times the shots on goal

31:32.992 --> 31:34.458
but it's three-nothing for them.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.993
How do you beat Sawchuk?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.394
He knows what you're
gonna do before you do it.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.429
I lie awake at night.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.932
I think my wife's
gonna leave me.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.136
- Coach, you in mid-stroke?

31:52.177 --> 31:55.646
- Harvey, what
the fuck was that?

31:55.648 --> 31:57.180
- Uh, that's an octopus.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.516
<i> - A what?</i>

31:59.518 --> 32:02.119
<i> Am I losing my damn mind?</i>

32:03.455 --> 32:05.155
<i>Eight legs.</i>

32:05.157 --> 32:07.124
Eight wins.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.992
Fuckers.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.229
We wanted it bad, yeah.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.234
But, uh, you know,
Terry was possessed.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.170
Oh,

32:20.172 --> 32:21.939
we tried to stay up, but...

32:21.941 --> 32:25.475
we knew crawling back
from a three-nil deficit

32:25.477 --> 32:28.512
with him in the
net was impossible.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.481
<i>Skate, skate, skate!</i>

32:37.656 --> 32:39.523
- What are you, nuts?
- I hate nuts.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.658
- Terry, I got it.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.394
Are you nuts? Huh?
Are you nuts?

32:44.396 --> 32:46.296
Huh?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.881
- Hey, Ref, you seen a
goddamn referee tonight?

32:47.882 --> 32:49.465
- All right, all right.
- Get back, Terry.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.135
- Good job, Marcel. Miss it.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.251
Ah!

33:14.426 --> 33:15.759
<i>... nine, eight,</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:19.129
<i> seven, six, five,</i>

33:19.131 --> 33:22.299
<i> four, three, two, one!</i>

33:27.072 --> 33:28.672
<i> Detroit wins the cup!</i>

33:40.152 --> 33:43.720
Here we go!
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

33:47.092 --> 33:49.393
Pretty intense for your first
NHL game, hey there, call-up?

33:49.395 --> 33:51.395
No. We're always
ready in Edmonton

33:51.397 --> 33:53.163
for when we
get our chance.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.798
- Who's good
up there, anyway?

33:54.800 --> 33:58.201
- Gotta see this goalie,
Glenn Hall.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.636
<i> Spreads like a butterfly.</i>

33:59.638 --> 34:01.605
<i> - Oh, hear that, Uke?</i>

34:01.607 --> 34:03.306
You better
watch your back;

34:03.308 --> 34:05.809
got a butterfly in the wings.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.445
- Okay. Here's the deal:

34:08.447 --> 34:10.380
<i> you're going to put chicken</i>
<i> bones in Boiter's hockey bag.</i>

34:10.382 --> 34:12.649
See if he washes
it over the summer

34:12.651 --> 34:14.251
or if it's covered
in maggots next fall.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.720
- Hey, hey, hey!

34:19.324 --> 34:22.359
You and I are going to be
doing this a lot more, Terry.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.728
- Proud of you boys! Enjoy!
- Want some?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.631
<i>Wake up in a pool</i>
<i> of your own vomit.</i>

34:35.574 --> 34:37.841
- Yeah, it's
good to be home.

34:37.843 --> 34:41.478
But I'll be ready to get back
once fall hits, that's for sure.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.580
- Yeah, speakin' of
getting back, I should.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.849
- What? No. See you at the
plant, boys. What are you do--?

34:45.851 --> 34:48.218
No. I'm buying.
Stick around.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.756
- Lucky for you,
your dad got you on.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.858
They're cutting jobs.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.333
- You been up to see Mitch yet?

35:04.670 --> 35:06.803
- No, not yet.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.607
I'm gonna get up there.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.543
Just want to unwind, you know?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.516
There's a lot of
pressure down there.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.284
But, hey, if things
keep going like this,

35:21.286 --> 35:23.120
I could get a good
salary real soon,

35:23.122 --> 35:25.622
maybe I could get you
and mom a nicer house.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.824
- Nicer?

35:27.826 --> 35:30.360
- Not nicer. Just, I--

35:30.362 --> 35:32.162
I could send more money home.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.631
- Yeah. We should get going.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.200
<i> - Yeah.</i> Yeah.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.403
- Your mother'll want
to see you in the morning.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.839
<i> - Yeah. I think I might</i>
stick around for one more.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.677
- Suit yourself.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.684
- Hey! Can I get one
more before I head home?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.920
Yeah, just one more.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.423
It's nice to be home.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.559
Nice to be home.

36:17.943 --> 36:18.842
- Hello?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.544
- Pronovost!

36:20.546 --> 36:22.412
Hey! It's Uke.
How you doing?

36:22.414 --> 36:23.747
- Jeez, Terry?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.799
<i> - Yeah.</i>

36:25.800 --> 36:27.850
- You all right?
It's two in the morning.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.753
- Yeah, what,

36:29.755 --> 36:31.421
what are you doing?

36:31.423 --> 36:32.856
I just, uh,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.558
you know, I was wondering
if you remember

36:34.560 --> 36:36.526
<i> what game it was</i>

36:36.528 --> 36:39.829
we pulled that
prank on Boiter?

36:40.265 --> 36:42.599
'Cause I gotta-I gotta-I
gotta group of people here

36:42.601 --> 36:44.834
and they were, uh...

36:44.836 --> 36:46.836
they-they were
wondering and I said,

36:46.838 --> 36:48.972
I know who has the memory
of a fucking elephant.

36:51.192 --> 36:53.409
<i> Yeah. Okay. All right.</i>
<i>Well, I'll ju- I'll let you go.</i>

36:53.412 --> 36:54.678
I was-- Hey, wait!

36:54.680 --> 36:57.247
Have you heard
anything about, um...

36:59.484 --> 37:00.884
Jack is happy, right?

37:00.886 --> 37:04.521
He-he's happy with the way
the team as it is, right?

37:04.523 --> 37:06.406
- Uh, I don't know, Terry.

37:06.407 --> 37:08.290
Why don't you call him at
two in the morning and ask him?

37:09.828 --> 37:12.262
- Okay.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.498
Okay. Okay.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.974
I'm going.

37:32.951 --> 37:36.453
Ah! Ahhh!

37:44.329 --> 37:46.463
Think God
lets dogs in heaven?

37:46.465 --> 37:49.399
Sure he does.
In heaven they're allowed inside

37:49.401 --> 37:52.035
and they're even
allowed to drink Cokes.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.776
<i>Where the</i>
<i> hell is my kettle?!</i>

38:20.332 --> 38:22.299
Hey! Hey!

38:29.841 --> 38:31.775
- Ah-ha! Mr. Norris:

38:31.777 --> 38:33.643
<i> there's your team.</i>

38:33.645 --> 38:35.745
<i> This bunch here?</i>

38:35.746 --> 38:37.846
<i> They play like they could read</i>
<i> each other's minds. Magical!</i>

38:37.849 --> 38:39.582
- For what I shell out,

38:39.584 --> 38:41.451
they better
be damn genies.

38:43.055 --> 38:44.621
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

38:44.623 --> 38:46.923
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

38:46.925 --> 38:49.859
<i>Go back for that.</i>

38:49.861 --> 38:51.094
<i> Come on, I'll pass you one.</i>

38:51.096 --> 38:52.529
- Terry Sawchuk.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.764
<i> - In the flesh.</i>

38:54.766 --> 38:57.600
- Flesh is right. He got fat.

38:57.602 --> 38:58.535
<i>Good job, ladies.</i>

39:00.439 --> 39:03.807
- I'll make damn sure
he burns it off, sir.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.742
- Yeah.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.846
<i>All right.</i>
<i> Let's go.</i>

39:11.383 --> 39:13.817
- Hey, Ter. Come on in.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.554
- Mr. Norris.
Nice to see you again.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.789
- How are you, Terry?
- Good. Good.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.892
- Uh, let's get you
on the scale, huh, son?

39:24.830 --> 39:27.497
Let's see
what we got here.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.869
All right. Up.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.571
Oh, boy.

39:35.740 --> 39:36.906
All right. Let's try this.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.491
- You know what?

39:38.492 --> 39:40.075
Let me try it again without
the cigarette in my hand.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.978
Yeah, sure.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.814
You spend the off-season
eating Ukrainian dumplings

39:44.816 --> 39:46.449
out of the Calder Trophy?

39:48.102 --> 39:49.752
Game time. You're going
to drop the weight.

39:49.755 --> 39:50.920
Right?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.455
The fans, they're fickle.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.057
They love you one night
and hate you the next.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.125
Let's not give them a reason.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.459
- I'll get the weight down.

39:56.461 --> 39:57.660
- All right.
- Okay.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.279
Good.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.897
Hit that door on your way out,
if you wouldn't mind.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.169
- Okay.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.912
- The football player.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.946
- Hockey.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.150
- I don't care
much for either.

40:20.152 --> 40:21.885
My Dad owns this
place so I fake it.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.753
Hockey's good for business.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.055
- Well, I'm a goalie.

40:26.057 --> 40:29.559
And the job of the goalie
is to stop the puck

40:29.561 --> 40:31.694
from going in

40:31.696 --> 40:33.530
the net.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.436
And when you do...

40:39.438 --> 40:41.571
you're the hero.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.540
When you don't,

40:44.876 --> 40:46.910
you come to the bar alone.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.713
- Looks like it
gets pretty rough.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.649
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

40:52.651 --> 40:53.883
- Try that again, Merle,

40:53.885 --> 40:55.685
and I'll dig it into
the back of your skull!

40:58.190 --> 40:59.622
<i>Jeez.</i>

40:59.624 --> 41:01.958
Jesus! What
are you, part lion?

41:02.627 --> 41:05.562
- Maybe I should have a goalie
to stand right there between me

41:05.564 --> 41:08.064
- and all of them.
- You mean a defenseman.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.934
- I think I'd
rather a goalie.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.089
<i> You hungry?</i>

41:16.090 --> 41:18.140
Tonight's gravy's so
thick you could walk on it.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.678
- I'll just take a whiskey.

41:28.503 --> 41:30.153
<i> What's going on in Detroit?</i>

41:30.155 --> 41:33.022
<i> The Wings are not the same</i>
<i> team they were last year.</i>

41:39.097 --> 41:41.164
<i>Come on!</i>

41:41.166 --> 41:42.866
- Which team you
playing for, Marcel?

41:44.002 --> 41:44.968
- Detroit.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.136
<i>- You're hanging me out to dry!</i>

41:47.138 --> 41:49.072
Hanging me out to dry.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.682
- Huh.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.786
Feeling the need for
a drink after that one.

42:37.022 --> 42:40.089
- Naw, I, uh...

42:40.091 --> 42:42.625
No.

42:42.627 --> 42:44.561
- Yeah.

42:55.206 --> 42:57.340
- Fucker.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.609
Get out of here.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.761
<i>Christmas,</i>
<i> with his foot in a cast.</i>

43:18.763 --> 43:20.830
<i> That came off</i>

43:20.832 --> 43:22.865
and Pulford skated
over three of his fingers.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.268
Besides starving himself,

43:25.270 --> 43:28.605
cuts, bruises, disc
ruptures from that crouch,

43:28.607 --> 43:31.040
he was only sleeping
three hours a night.

43:31.042 --> 43:34.611
But he would've remembered what
happened when Lumley was out

43:34.613 --> 43:36.079
<i> with a broken ankle.</i>

43:36.681 --> 43:37.914
- Great. You're not
gonna believe this:

43:37.916 --> 43:39.482
Glenn Hall is in town
doing a hockey camp.

43:39.483 --> 43:41.049
Just left his hotel for the
airport. We're going to ...

43:41.052 --> 43:43.019
- No, No, No.
<i>- Catch him at the airport</i>

43:43.021 --> 43:44.437
- Forget the freeze.
Forget the freeze.

43:44.438 --> 43:45.854
Just stitch me up and
get me back out there.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.724
<i>- Have you seen your face?</i>
- Let him go.

43:47.726 --> 43:49.392
We're good here.
We're good here.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.059
- All right, forget it.
I guess we're good here.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.062
Stitch him up!

43:54.099 --> 43:55.765
- It's only a couple years
since they tossed him

43:55.767 --> 43:57.734
Lumley's sweater.

43:58.069 --> 43:59.836
Six goalies in the league.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.005
One sweater per team.

44:02.007 --> 44:04.841
With general managers
short on cotton and patience,

44:04.843 --> 44:07.377
we goalies were constantly
looking over our shoulders.

44:07.379 --> 44:09.379
<i>Sawchuk, Sawchuk,</i>
<i> Sawchuk, Sawchuk.</i>

44:13.318 --> 44:15.151
- You love me tonight, do ya'?

44:16.921 --> 44:18.921
Go fuck yourselves.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.354
- Hey. Hey, Terry.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.133
Come on, darlin'.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.940
Hey, let's go.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.431
- My jacket.
- Yeah.

45:18.432 --> 45:20.048
- My jacket.
- I got it. I got it.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.018
- Okay.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.119
Go to bed, honey.

45:23.121 --> 45:24.921
- Mm-hm.

45:26.791 --> 45:28.925
- I'm not drunk.

45:28.927 --> 45:31.394
I just, I didn't have dinner.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.963
- All right.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.968
<i>Detroit loses a fourth straight</i>

45:38.970 --> 45:41.871
<i>despite Sawchuk turning away an</i>
<i> unbelievable 48 shots on goal.</i>

45:41.873 --> 45:43.323
- Terry, what
were you thinking

45:43.324 --> 45:44.774
when you let that
easy one by in the third?

45:44.776 --> 45:46.743
- I don't know.
- Is the pressure

45:46.745 --> 45:48.511
to repeat the season you
had last year getting to you?

45:48.513 --> 45:50.847
- Why don't you get out there
and take 50 shots to the face?

45:50.849 --> 45:52.882
I'll ask how you
feel about it, okay?

45:52.884 --> 45:54.951
- Hey. Out.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.459
Where are we?

46:07.899 --> 46:10.967
Where are we!?

46:10.969 --> 46:12.034
- Detroit.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.237
<i> - No, you invalid.</i>

46:15.240 --> 46:17.173
Rock bottom!

46:17.175 --> 46:20.476
That's where we are!

46:20.478 --> 46:23.079
And you sorry sons of bitches
better figure out a way

46:23.081 --> 46:24.881
to climb out.

46:24.883 --> 46:28.050
Unless you wanna be playing
for Coal Mine Workers of America

46:28.052 --> 46:29.485
next season

46:29.487 --> 46:32.522
which is all
you'll be fit to do!

46:33.958 --> 46:35.892
And you:

46:36.461 --> 46:39.228
<i> not enjoying the</i>
pucks coming at ya'?

46:40.398 --> 46:42.265
Maybe you're not fit
for the job anymore.

46:42.267 --> 46:45.201
- We're out of
the playoffs anyway.

46:45.203 --> 46:46.869
- What did you say?

46:46.871 --> 46:48.437
- I said we're out of
the playoffs anyway.

46:48.439 --> 46:50.106
We got five games left.

46:50.108 --> 46:51.991
And they don't mean anything

46:51.992 --> 46:53.875
and I got these press jerkoffs
rubbing my face in shit.

46:53.878 --> 46:54.544
<i> - Yeah, yeah.</i>

46:54.546 --> 46:56.179
No. You don't want that.

46:56.181 --> 46:58.948
You don't want
shit in the face.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.120
Get down

47:04.122 --> 47:05.888
and shit on the floor.

47:11.462 --> 47:14.230
Shit on the floor!!

47:19.204 --> 47:21.604
You can't even
fucking do that right?

47:24.475 --> 47:26.375
I got no room

47:26.377 --> 47:28.377
on my hockey club

47:28.379 --> 47:31.614
for anyone who
can't take the heat.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.639
- Jack.

47:56.641 --> 47:58.941
Jack's a dumb name. Jack.

47:58.943 --> 48:00.643
It sounds like
a cat throwing up.

48:00.645 --> 48:01.944
- You wouldn't name a kid Jack?

48:01.946 --> 48:04.280
- Not on your life.

48:04.282 --> 48:06.916
Maybe... Penelope?

48:06.918 --> 48:08.351
- I like Anthony.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.585
- Mm.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.454
I had a regular
named Anthony.

48:11.456 --> 48:14.190
He always took his pants off
when he drank Canadian whiskey.

48:14.192 --> 48:16.092
- I bet when you name your
kid Anthony, you forget about

48:16.094 --> 48:17.526
all the Anthony's that
you didn't like before.

48:17.528 --> 48:20.463
- I didn't say
I didn't like him.

48:27.171 --> 48:30.273
You know, I always
liked the name Charles.

48:32.310 --> 48:34.911
- Chuck? Chuck?
Chuck Sawchuk?

48:36.114 --> 48:39.081
- Who says my babies
are gonna be Sawchuks?

48:40.018 --> 48:43.352
- Well, I'm not sittin' here

48:43.354 --> 48:45.655
coming up with baby names

48:45.657 --> 48:47.590
for you and
some other fella.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.993
- Mm. Wow. You
don't waste any time.

48:52.563 --> 48:54.664
- Take your
shot when you, uh...

48:55.934 --> 48:57.967
when you get the chance.

49:01.572 --> 49:04.707
But if Jack trades me, I'm
going to have to start all over

49:05.410 --> 49:08.411
with some Catholic girl
from Boston

49:08.413 --> 49:09.612
or a French girl
from Montreal.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.147
Oh, I hear they're spicy.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.082
- What kind of dad
would you be, anyway?

49:13.084 --> 49:14.317
Always on the
road. Never home.

49:14.319 --> 49:16.585
- No, no way. No way.

49:16.587 --> 49:19.956
I'd flood the yard,
make a rink.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.191
I'd teach 'em
all to play hockey.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.060
Have my own little
team of midgets.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.195
Bet on 'em. Retire.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.106
- Okay.

49:39.210 --> 49:41.210
- Okay?

49:42.213 --> 49:44.013
Oh...

49:44.015 --> 49:46.215
Okay? O-okay what?

49:46.217 --> 49:49.118
Okay. Okay, okay, what?

49:49.120 --> 49:50.753
Okay, you'd marry me?

49:51.289 --> 49:53.222
- If-if that's
what you're asking?

49:53.224 --> 49:54.557
- Well, yeah. It is now!

49:54.559 --> 49:56.225
- Well, then yeah!

50:03.001 --> 50:04.667
- What if I got hurt
and I couldn't play?

50:04.669 --> 50:06.235
- That's easy. I'd just

50:06.237 --> 50:07.770
leave you for
Merle the drunk.

50:07.772 --> 50:10.706
He's going to inherit a fortune
when his mother dies.

50:12.143 --> 50:16.712
I would live in a railway car
and beg for a living

50:17.548 --> 50:21.183
if it meant that I got to
do it with Mr. Terry Sawchuk.

50:24.522 --> 50:27.423
You just have to
promise me one thing:

50:27.425 --> 50:30.493
that every now and then you'll
take your mind off hockey.

50:34.198 --> 50:35.731
My mind's not on hockey now.

50:50.615 --> 50:52.181
<i>- Terry.</i>
- Hey.

50:52.183 --> 50:54.784
I, um...

50:54.786 --> 50:58.054
I'm sick about how
we went out this year.

50:58.790 --> 51:00.756
I let the pressure get to me.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.126
- Two years in a row
you win the Vezina trophy

51:04.128 --> 51:06.729
and all you think about
are the pucks that got in?

51:07.799 --> 51:08.597
- I'm getting married.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.466
- Well, congratulations.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.334
- Yeah, I know you said to
stay away from the girls,

51:12.336 --> 51:14.136
so I-I figured I'd
do it in the off season.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.688
- Oh, that's smart.

51:15.689 --> 51:17.239
- Yeah. But come fall,
I'll be focused on my game.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.141
- Good. Not worried about it.

51:19.143 --> 51:21.710
- Yeah. Just, uh, just
thinking about the future,

51:21.712 --> 51:23.446
you know?

51:23.448 --> 51:25.548
Um...

51:25.550 --> 51:28.851
Maybe buy a house. Just...

51:28.853 --> 51:30.719
Just not sure.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.555
- Hm.

51:32.557 --> 51:36.258
You and me, huh? Always in
the balance if we don't perform.

51:37.228 --> 51:40.429
I think of you
as a son, Terry.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.598
I expect to be
invited to that wedding.

51:49.874 --> 51:52.608
<i> A shot from the point...</i>

51:52.610 --> 51:55.478
<i> Sawchuk bats at it. Wait!</i>

51:56.614 --> 51:58.547
<i> He's down. He's hit.</i>

51:58.549 --> 52:01.450
<i> Sawchuk is down and</i>
<i> the puck is in the net!</i>

52:07.225 --> 52:08.491
- You all right?

52:08.493 --> 52:10.593
- You maybe see some,
ah, teeth around here,

52:10.595 --> 52:12.561
- would you, buddy?
<i>- You got it.</i>

52:12.563 --> 52:13.896
<i>Sawchuk!</i>

52:13.898 --> 52:15.865
<i> That goal light's</i>
<i> gonna give you a sunburn.</i>

52:15.867 --> 52:17.500
- What son of a
bitch said that?

52:17.502 --> 52:18.667
<i> That stuff</i>

52:18.669 --> 52:20.970
<i> doesn't bother these guys.</i>

52:20.971 --> 52:23.272
<i> Terry is a professional.</i>
<i> They just tune that stuff out.</i>

52:23.274 --> 52:25.541
- Right there.
<i>- Sawchuk. Sawchuk!</i>

52:26.511 --> 52:28.244
- Oh, no, no.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.496
- Yeah?

52:30.497 --> 52:32.314
<i>Not</i>
<i>sure that's the case this time!</i>

52:32.316 --> 52:33.782
- Tabernac! Oh, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

52:35.602 --> 52:37.419
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i> get in there, huh? Huh?</i>

52:37.421 --> 52:39.221
Do you want to get
in the fuckin' net?

52:39.223 --> 52:40.956
- No! No!

52:40.957 --> 52:42.690
- Get the fuck out! You
better run! You better run, boy!

52:45.863 --> 52:47.563
- Damn it!

52:49.433 --> 52:51.200
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

52:53.237 --> 52:54.870
- Fan hit a nerve
there, huh, Terry?

52:54.872 --> 52:56.805
- Okay, fellas, I could use...

52:56.807 --> 52:58.507
Give me a minute.
I'm in a little pain, here.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.276
- How do you think
kids who look up to you

53:00.278 --> 53:01.844
will feel about you
going after a fan?

53:01.846 --> 53:03.345
- Okay. Please, guys,
he asked for a minute.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.713
Just give him some space,
okay? Please, please.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.348
- Do you know
how many people

53:06.350 --> 53:07.483
would want to be
in your position?

53:07.485 --> 53:08.901
- Okay, come on.
That's enough!

53:08.902 --> 53:10.318
- I think this is
the first time in hockey

53:10.321 --> 53:11.687
we've seen someone crack
under pressure like--

53:11.689 --> 53:12.588
- That's enough! I said--

53:13.691 --> 53:15.324
What the fuck
are you doing?

53:15.326 --> 53:16.792
- It's okay. Calm down.

53:16.794 --> 53:19.361
- All right. Let's go, fellas.
You got enough, huh? Thanks.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.313
<i> You! What the hell?</i>
<i> It's not bad enough</i>

53:21.314 --> 53:23.264
<i> that in the supermarket</i>
<i> they're asking my wife,</i>

53:23.267 --> 53:25.634
"What the goddamn is the
matter with Terry Sawchuk?"

53:25.636 --> 53:27.236
Now, what are these guys
gonna write?

53:27.238 --> 53:28.437
How's it gonna look, huh?

53:28.438 --> 53:29.637
That the inmates are
<i> running the ship!</i>

53:29.640 --> 53:31.807
- I'm the one standin'
on my head out there!

53:31.809 --> 53:33.776
- Maybe you need to rest?

53:33.778 --> 53:35.628
- No.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.479
- Yeah. I'm calling
Glenn Hall up from Edmonton.

53:40.451 --> 53:42.101
- You know what?

53:42.102 --> 53:43.752
That pond hockey hick
won't last a fucking game!

53:56.901 --> 53:58.634
<i> Belliveau gets it up the ice</i>

53:58.636 --> 53:59.735
<i> to Geoffrion who shoots.</i>

53:59.737 --> 54:01.403
<i> Kicked away by Hall!</i>

54:01.405 --> 54:04.573
<i> This kid's coverage</i>
<i> is something else.</i>

54:04.575 --> 54:06.375
<i>- Terry, you hungry?</i>
- What?

54:06.377 --> 54:08.844
<i> - The Canadiens</i>
<i> are testing him tonight.</i>

54:08.846 --> 54:10.512
- Steak, salad, Jello.
All your favorites.

54:10.514 --> 54:11.914
- Goddammit, Pat!
I don't want any food

54:11.916 --> 54:12.948
next to the chesterfield. Shh!

54:12.950 --> 54:14.250
It's fine!

54:14.251 --> 54:15.551
<i> - Sawchuk's injury</i>
<i> seemed a real blow</i>

54:15.553 --> 54:17.920
<i> to the Wings fighting</i>
<i> for a playoff spot.</i>

54:17.922 --> 54:20.856
<i> But Hall's</i>
<i> proving himself nicely.</i>

54:20.858 --> 54:24.660
<i> Jack Adams must be</i>
<i> feeling relieved at that.</i>

54:24.662 --> 54:26.962
- He's gonna replace me.
- Hey.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.464
- He's going to replace me.

54:28.466 --> 54:29.898
- No.
- He's done with me.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.900
One day he's calling me
"son" and then the next day

54:31.902 --> 54:33.369
I'm out in the fucking cold!

54:33.371 --> 54:35.655
- You don't need him.

54:35.656 --> 54:37.940
- Jesus Christ, Pat!
I can't eat this fattening shit!

54:41.712 --> 54:43.579
<i> Another shot gloved by Hall--</i>

54:53.057 --> 54:55.591
- I, uh...

54:55.593 --> 54:57.826
I'm sorry.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.497
It's not you.

55:04.935 --> 55:07.970
You're the only good thing.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.775
- It's okay.

55:13.711 --> 55:16.812
I know this has been tough.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.586
- Six goalies in the league.

55:24.588 --> 55:26.922
One sweater per team.

55:26.924 --> 55:29.725
You're working paycheque
to paycheque.

55:29.727 --> 55:32.328
<i> You're barely scraping by.</i>

55:36.067 --> 55:38.033
<i>Yeah. The good old</i>

55:38.035 --> 55:39.635
hockey game.

55:39.637 --> 55:44.973
It'll ask for everything you got
and, in the end, it'll kill ya'.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.475
<i> Goalies first.</i>

55:46.477 --> 55:48.410
- Hey! Hey, can I get in there?

55:50.348 --> 55:53.048
<i>Read a catcher</i>

55:53.050 --> 55:55.684
in baseball once said:

55:55.686 --> 55:58.487
"There must be some reason

55:58.489 --> 56:01.390
we're the only ones
facing the other way."

56:01.392 --> 56:02.491
Hm.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.727
- Hey.

56:06.864 --> 56:09.832
It's like I'm holding God.

56:10.768 --> 56:12.701
Hi.

56:33.758 --> 56:37.493
- He would have thrown
himself in front of a bus

56:37.495 --> 56:39.762
for that team in
the first five years.

56:41.365 --> 56:42.965
<i> That's the kind</i>
<i> of goalie he was.</i>

56:42.966 --> 56:44.566
<i>That's right, Mr.</i>
<i> Terry Sawchuk has been traded</i>

56:44.568 --> 56:45.934
<i> from the Detroit Red Wings</i>
<i> to the Boston Bruins.</i>

56:45.936 --> 56:48.137
- Hello.

56:48.139 --> 56:49.972
- It's a boy.

56:49.974 --> 56:51.940
It's a boy.

56:53.944 --> 56:55.677
Well, I-I...

56:55.679 --> 56:57.479
Wonder how he's gonna
like living in Boston?

56:57.782 --> 56:59.581
- Boston?

56:59.583 --> 57:00.816
<i> - Just heard</i>
<i> it on the radio.</i>

57:00.818 --> 57:03.051
They traded
you to the Bruins.

57:54.472 --> 57:56.071
- Hey, pal.

57:56.073 --> 57:58.941
- My wife had a baby.

57:59.543 --> 58:02.244
- Yeah. I know that.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.480
<i> - Good.</i>

58:05.916 --> 58:07.549
- But know what?

58:07.551 --> 58:09.151
I think we
should go see her.

58:09.153 --> 58:11.186
Come on.
I'll drive ya'. Hm?

58:11.188 --> 58:13.589
- I think Jack
should meet him.

58:13.591 --> 58:15.691
- Okay, listen, man:

58:17.127 --> 58:19.261
it's two in the morning.

58:19.263 --> 58:21.830
Jack is not even
in the building.

58:23.601 --> 58:26.134
Come on. Let's go home.

58:26.136 --> 58:28.837
I'll drive you.

58:31.509 --> 58:32.941
Please. Get in the car.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.677
- No! Fuck the car!

58:36.780 --> 58:38.947
- Please?

58:39.683 --> 58:41.850
- He never even came
to the wedding.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.120
- Yeah, I know.

58:46.824 --> 58:49.057
Well, I did.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.262
I came to the wedding.

58:58.536 --> 59:01.003
Come on. Hm?

59:01.005 --> 59:03.572
Let's go home.

59:05.042 --> 59:06.808
- You had a name card, Jack!

59:06.810 --> 59:09.011
- Sh, sh, sh. Terry, listen:

59:11.148 --> 59:14.016
gonna be okay. Hm?

59:14.218 --> 59:16.952
- I'm going to
miss you, brother.

59:18.155 --> 59:21.089
- I'll miss you, too.

59:21.091 --> 59:23.625
Right now,
time to go to bed.

59:23.627 --> 59:25.193
- Mm. Okay.

59:25.195 --> 59:27.796
- That's it.
Okay. Follow me.

59:27.798 --> 59:30.332
<i>Go take a shower,</i>
<i> ya' bunch a fuckin' bums!</i>

59:30.334 --> 59:32.134
<i> Ya' need it!</i>

59:32.135 --> 59:33.935
- So, who gets
to kill that guy?

59:49.587 --> 59:51.853
Pathetic pouters.

59:52.823 --> 59:55.691
Pull your heads out of your
asses and compete out there!

59:55.693 --> 59:58.260
You're an embarrassment.

59:58.262 --> 1:00:00.195
We got Terry Sawchuk in goal!

1:00:00.197 --> 1:00:03.899
<i> We finally have a chance</i>
<i> to make the playoffs so just</i>

1:00:03.901 --> 1:00:05.767
<i> pull it together.</i>

1:00:07.871 --> 1:00:10.739
This is our barn.

1:00:10.741 --> 1:00:13.875
We let them walk
into our barn and piss

1:00:13.877 --> 1:00:15.644
all over our barn.

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.114
Shit's spraying all over
our barn, boys, let me tell you.

1:00:21.318 --> 1:00:23.385
Who's going to
clean up that shit, huh?

1:00:23.387 --> 1:00:24.720
Hm?

1:00:24.722 --> 1:00:27.756
Our barn stinks like shit!

1:00:27.758 --> 1:00:29.992
And so do you!

1:00:39.803 --> 1:00:41.637
<i>See, guys?</i>

1:00:41.639 --> 1:00:43.905
This...

1:00:43.907 --> 1:00:46.642
This is the team
bonding we need! We're--

1:00:46.644 --> 1:00:49.645
We're brothers! This
is how it's supposed to be!

1:00:51.348 --> 1:00:53.181
<i> Come on, man.</i>

1:00:53.183 --> 1:00:55.817
Look, we're a team!

1:00:56.754 --> 1:00:58.253
Who's doing that?

1:01:00.124 --> 1:01:02.190
<i> Schmidt's right!</i>

1:01:02.192 --> 1:01:06.028
We could make the playoffs with
Terry backstopping us but we...

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:08.330
We gotta bond.

1:01:08.332 --> 1:01:12.000
Cal's never been
on a roller coaster.

1:01:12.703 --> 1:01:15.804
Who's never been
on a roller coaster?

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:19.207
Well, let's go to a bar!

1:01:19.209 --> 1:01:22.077
Hey? You guys
want to go to a bar?

1:01:23.947 --> 1:01:27.683
All right. Well,
let's hit the showers,

1:01:28.152 --> 1:01:30.252
and then we'll hit the town!

1:01:32.322 --> 1:01:33.822
Okay.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.694
- You want to come
for a drink, Terry?

1:01:38.696 --> 1:01:41.029
- Uh, maybe some other time.

1:01:43.701 --> 1:01:45.967
- All right.

1:01:47.938 --> 1:01:49.988
<i> We let Sawchuk go</i>

1:01:49.989 --> 1:01:52.039
<i> because we found ourselves</i>
<i> with two top goalies.</i>

1:01:52.042 --> 1:01:55.877
<i> Hall is more advanced now than</i>
<i> Sawchuk was when he joined us.</i>

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:58.346
- Boston's not
so bad, Terry.

1:01:58.348 --> 1:02:01.316
Unless we get
those funny accents.

1:02:01.318 --> 1:02:03.368
You don't think
little Jerry and Jr.

1:02:03.369 --> 1:02:05.419
<i> are going to speak with</i>
<i> those accents do you? Bowston.</i>

1:02:05.422 --> 1:02:07.456
- I'm serious.

1:02:07.458 --> 1:02:09.908
I'm serious.

1:02:09.909 --> 1:02:12.359
Call the school and complain
if the kids talk like that.

1:02:13.931 --> 1:02:15.897
It's not right.

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:18.166
You were all so
close in Detroit and

1:02:18.168 --> 1:02:19.868
then to hear about
it from your parents--

1:02:22.106 --> 1:02:23.722
Fantastic.

1:02:23.723 --> 1:02:25.339
Clean that up before
your kid crawls in it.

1:02:25.342 --> 1:02:27.008
- He doesn't even
know how to crawl.

1:02:27.010 --> 1:02:28.043
- Jack's not your family.

1:02:28.045 --> 1:02:30.779
We're your family.
He used you.

1:02:30.781 --> 1:02:32.414
- He needed me.

1:02:32.415 --> 1:02:34.048
<i> - Jack is a guy who got</i>
<i> you to shatter your bones</i>

1:02:34.051 --> 1:02:35.918
<i> to line his pocket.</i>

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:37.786
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:02:40.290 --> 1:02:42.324
- You didn't get paid
as much as Gordie.

1:02:42.326 --> 1:02:44.025
Colleen let that slip.

1:03:00.477 --> 1:03:03.245
- Old elbow's acting up again.

1:03:03.914 --> 1:03:07.149
My friend, Audrey,
she's a nurse,

1:03:07.151 --> 1:03:09.551
<i> she says when a</i>
<i> bone doesn't set right,</i>

1:03:09.553 --> 1:03:11.953
it'll hurt forever.

1:03:11.955 --> 1:03:13.822
- Well, can't blame
this one on Jack.

1:03:13.824 --> 1:03:16.024
It happened
when I was a kid.

1:03:16.026 --> 1:03:17.559
I never had it set.

1:03:17.561 --> 1:03:19.127
- You're parents didn't?

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:21.263
- Uh, they didn't know.

1:03:22.366 --> 1:03:25.033
They didn't like weakness.
Especially in kids.

1:03:26.003 --> 1:03:28.837
What, your father'd whup you
if you broke your arm?

1:03:28.839 --> 1:03:30.305
- My mother was worse.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:32.974
- Well, I believe that.

1:03:32.976 --> 1:03:35.377
I'm going to put you down.

1:03:38.015 --> 1:03:39.981
- Hey, buddy.

1:03:42.019 --> 1:03:43.351
- He's sleepy.

1:03:57.568 --> 1:04:00.869
- I ever tell you
about Lady's puppies?

1:04:02.005 --> 1:04:04.539
When I tried to
bring 'em back to life?

1:04:04.541 --> 1:04:06.174
- Magic?

1:04:06.176 --> 1:04:08.343
- Woodstove.

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:10.946
<i> Our dog had, um,</i>

1:04:10.948 --> 1:04:13.615
<i> her puppies</i>
<i> under the porch.</i>

1:04:14.418 --> 1:04:17.419
50 below winter.

1:04:17.421 --> 1:04:20.055
And she wanted in but

1:04:20.057 --> 1:04:21.923
fat chance of that
in the Sawchuk household,

1:04:21.925 --> 1:04:23.391
they barely let us in.

1:04:28.565 --> 1:04:31.566
I remember those puppies.

1:04:33.136 --> 1:04:36.104
<i> Raw little chicken things,</i>

1:04:38.008 --> 1:04:40.442
<i> frozen to</i> the--

1:04:40.444 --> 1:04:43.211
to the wood beam.

1:04:43.213 --> 1:04:46.281
I tried to-I tried to
not tear their little legs.

1:04:49.453 --> 1:04:53.221
Mom wouldn't have a three-legged
dog, not like you, Pat.

1:04:55.292 --> 1:04:58.460
I got taught a
lesson that day, boy.

1:05:01.565 --> 1:05:04.900
That dog just wandered
in circles for days.

1:05:04.902 --> 1:05:06.468
For days.

1:05:07.371 --> 1:05:09.371
You could--

1:05:09.373 --> 1:05:12.641
You could trace
its path in the snow

1:05:12.643 --> 1:05:14.342
in blood.

1:05:18.482 --> 1:05:22.284
I never saw grief in my
mother's eyes like I did--

1:05:22.286 --> 1:05:25.153
Like I did in that dog's.

1:05:28.525 --> 1:05:32.360
Not even when Mitch--

1:05:35.966 --> 1:05:38.033
Not even when Mitch, uh...

1:05:38.035 --> 1:05:40.268
- When Mitch died.

1:05:49.413 --> 1:05:53.415
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna wake the baby.

1:05:53.417 --> 1:05:54.983
- He's used to your
temper tantrums,

1:05:54.985 --> 1:05:56.384
he'll sleep
right through.

1:05:56.386 --> 1:05:58.219
- My temper tantrums?
- I was just making light.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:05:59.621
- You're always
saying that to me.

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:00.722
- I'm sorry, Terry.

1:06:00.724 --> 1:06:02.991
- Why would you
say that to me?

1:06:02.992 --> 1:06:05.259
Don't try and make me stay
when you know I gotta go

1:06:05.262 --> 1:06:06.728
'cause I'm going
to regret something

1:06:06.730 --> 1:06:08.096
if you try and
make me fucking stay!

1:06:08.098 --> 1:06:10.131
- Please don't go.

1:06:22.045 --> 1:06:24.596
- Another one.

1:06:24.597 --> 1:06:27.148
- I wonder if you haven't
had enough there, sir?

1:06:28.285 --> 1:06:31.720
Why, Davy, this
is Mr. Terry Sawchuk,

1:06:31.722 --> 1:06:34.456
Boston's very famous goalie.

1:06:34.458 --> 1:06:36.758
What if downing a bottle
the night before a game

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:38.660
is what makes him so good.

1:06:38.662 --> 1:06:40.562
Hm?

1:06:40.564 --> 1:06:43.298
Maybe bourbon is
his little secret.

1:06:43.300 --> 1:06:45.100
- Now I have to kill you.

1:06:45.102 --> 1:06:47.769
- That's a great pick-up line.

1:06:47.771 --> 1:06:51.172
Don't worry,
I'll get him home.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:58.113
And that one?

1:07:01.351 --> 1:07:02.717
- Henri Richard.

1:07:06.390 --> 1:07:08.757
And that one?

1:07:08.759 --> 1:07:10.692
- Nesterenko.

1:07:10.694 --> 1:07:13.595
<i> Game four of</i>
<i> the '52 series.</i>

1:07:13.597 --> 1:07:15.663
<i> - How about the bruises?</i>

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:19.334
- Practice.

1:07:20.704 --> 1:07:23.204
<i> - And the shiner?</i>

1:07:24.241 --> 1:07:26.241
- Practice.

1:07:26.243 --> 1:07:28.209
- You okay?

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:30.178
- Yeah.

1:07:37.721 --> 1:07:39.421
I, uh...

1:07:42.526 --> 1:07:44.526
- Oh.

1:07:46.496 --> 1:07:48.630
- I'll see ya'.
- Yeah.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:51.166
Look for me
on the ice, sweetheart!

1:07:51.168 --> 1:07:53.568
I'll be the one
wearing number 25.

1:07:56.106 --> 1:07:57.605
<i>- Fucker.</i>
<i>- You're out, Cal!</i>

1:07:57.607 --> 1:07:58.773
- Fuck you.
Who says I'm out?

1:07:58.775 --> 1:08:00.542
- It's "don't touch
the floor", man!

1:08:00.544 --> 1:08:02.710
The rules<i> are in the title.</i>

1:08:04.114 --> 1:08:05.647
- He's still got it.

1:08:05.649 --> 1:08:07.549
Richard! Richard!

1:08:07.551 --> 1:08:11.086
<i> - You dropped him, Ross!</i>
That's a fucking disgrace.

1:08:11.088 --> 1:08:12.554
<i> Do you like my belt?</i>

1:08:12.556 --> 1:08:14.656
- Oh, Jesus.
Get that away from me!

1:08:14.658 --> 1:08:16.424
Hey! Gardner! Gardner!

1:08:16.426 --> 1:08:17.425
Do you like my-- Ow!!

1:08:21.731 --> 1:08:24.833
- Willie, I just need
my hair, man.<i> Aw, fuck!</i>

1:08:24.835 --> 1:08:27.168
- End of the fucking world.

1:08:27.170 --> 1:08:28.820
<i> In hockey news,</i>

1:08:28.821 --> 1:08:30.471
<i> Terry Sawchuk takes on</i>
<i> his old team tonight</i>

1:08:30.474 --> 1:08:32.273
<i> as Boston heads to Detroit.</i>

1:09:06.776 --> 1:09:10.145
<i>Sawchuk! Sawchuk!</i>
<i> Sawchuk! Sawchuk!</i>

1:09:20.724 --> 1:09:22.490
- There he is.

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:25.360
Hey, there.
Come have a seat, son.

1:09:26.696 --> 1:09:28.596
- I, um...

1:09:28.598 --> 1:09:30.431
That's for the shoes.

1:09:30.433 --> 1:09:32.233
- What?

1:09:32.235 --> 1:09:35.236
- I never paid you back.
I don't like owing people.

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:43.178
- Come on, now.
Sit down, please.

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:47.415
- Oh, uh...

1:09:49.686 --> 1:09:52.187
- Okay, I traded you.

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:55.323
It's a team, not a family.

1:09:55.825 --> 1:09:59.227
- I never thought
it was a family.

1:10:01.731 --> 1:10:04.532
- You weren't the only one
worried about his job.

1:10:04.534 --> 1:10:07.835
It's a shit part
of mine too, you know.

1:10:07.837 --> 1:10:10.338
If I were a cattle farmer,

1:10:10.340 --> 1:10:13.942
feeding and looking
after calves and cows every day

1:10:13.944 --> 1:10:16.945
and one of them
stands out, a great one,

1:10:16.947 --> 1:10:19.581
that I care about,
<i> maybe more than the others,</i>

1:10:19.583 --> 1:10:22.517
<i> that doesn't mean he still</i>
<i> won't end up on the barbeque.</i>

1:10:24.221 --> 1:10:28.289
My job is to make sure the best
team is on the ice every day.

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:32.293
- And I don't belong
on the best team?

1:10:32.295 --> 1:10:33.595
- You played half
the season injured.

1:10:33.597 --> 1:10:35.964
- And why was that?

1:10:36.866 --> 1:10:38.733
<i> - Lumley's day came too.</i>

1:10:38.734 --> 1:10:40.601
- I'll leave you
to the slaughter.

1:10:46.910 --> 1:10:50.545
- Here it comes.
Here it comes.

1:10:50.547 --> 1:10:52.947
And the pitch...

1:10:52.949 --> 1:10:55.416
He scores!

1:10:57.654 --> 1:10:59.921
- Danny!

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:04.259
<i> That son of a bitch</i>
<i> is drunk again.</i>

1:11:07.964 --> 1:11:10.665
- Oh, my God.

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:18.273
<i> Are you crazy?</i>

1:11:18.275 --> 1:11:19.941
Get in here.

1:11:19.943 --> 1:11:22.844
Do you know what these folks do
for me when you're out of town?

1:11:22.846 --> 1:11:25.513
<i> They take our garbage</i>
to the curb.

1:11:25.515 --> 1:11:27.265
- I don't want
those busy-noses

1:11:27.266 --> 1:11:29.016
going through our garbage,
looking for autographs.

1:11:29.019 --> 1:11:31.853
Why you got
diapers here for!?

1:11:32.989 --> 1:11:34.389
- Terry! What are you doing?

1:11:34.391 --> 1:11:35.890
- I'm using the bathroom.

1:11:35.892 --> 1:11:37.925
- For heaven's sakes.
I've had it!

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:40.295
- Oh, now, now,
you woke up the baby.

1:11:43.466 --> 1:11:46.367
- Jerry? Jerry.

1:11:46.836 --> 1:11:48.503
- You found us!

1:11:48.505 --> 1:11:50.471
- Yeah. You're such
a big boy. Here,

1:11:50.473 --> 1:11:51.939
pass me your sister.

1:11:51.941 --> 1:11:55.310
- Yeah, Pat, you should
have married the banker.

1:11:55.312 --> 1:11:57.445
He wouldn't be drinking
and yelling<i> so much!!</i>

1:11:57.447 --> 1:12:00.014
- Can you pass
me that suitcase?

1:12:00.016 --> 1:12:01.816
Good job.

1:12:01.818 --> 1:12:03.685
We are going to tell Santa

1:12:03.687 --> 1:12:05.787
to come visit us at
Nanny and Poppy's this year.

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:08.790
- When it all- when it-
when it comes to an end

1:12:08.792 --> 1:12:11.326
<i> and the big one comes?</i>

1:12:11.328 --> 1:12:13.495
When the big one comes, Pat,

1:12:13.496 --> 1:12:15.663
those fucking pussies
will be crawling in their holes

1:12:15.665 --> 1:12:18.666
and I'll be out
howlin' at the fuckin' moon.

1:12:18.668 --> 1:12:21.769
Tree inside the house?

1:12:21.771 --> 1:12:23.471
- Wanna help Momma pack?

1:12:23.473 --> 1:12:24.672
- Yeah.

1:12:24.674 --> 1:12:26.674
- Hey, hey!

1:12:26.676 --> 1:12:29.477
- Okay, honey, no,
let's stop that.

1:12:29.479 --> 1:12:30.545
<i>Hey!</i>

1:12:34.451 --> 1:12:35.616
What are you doin'?

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:37.452
- We're going to Detroit.

1:12:37.454 --> 1:12:38.453
- Detroit is a shit-hole.

1:12:38.455 --> 1:12:39.487
What are you doing?

1:12:39.489 --> 1:12:40.822
- We are going to the house

1:12:40.824 --> 1:12:42.090
until you can get
a hold of yourself.

1:12:42.092 --> 1:12:43.491
<i> Come on, Jerry, let's go.</i>

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:44.959
- The house in Detroit?
- Yes.

1:12:44.961 --> 1:12:46.728
- I sold the fuckin' house, Pat.

1:12:46.730 --> 1:12:47.995
- You what?

1:12:47.997 --> 1:12:49.664
- What do you think,
I'm made of money?

1:12:49.666 --> 1:12:51.899
How are you gonna get
to Detroit anyway, huh?

1:12:51.901 --> 1:12:53.501
Did you take money
from my drawer, Pat?

1:12:53.503 --> 1:12:55.103
Did you take fuckin'
money from my drawer?

1:12:55.105 --> 1:12:57.839
Did you fuckin' take money
from my drawer, huh!? Did you?

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:58.740
- Stop it!

1:12:58.742 --> 1:12:59.941
Jerry, go, go.

1:12:59.942 --> 1:13:01.141
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Go downstairs.</i>

1:13:01.144 --> 1:13:02.677
- I'm sorry. Hey, hey, Pat.

1:13:02.679 --> 1:13:04.078
Oh, fuck...

1:13:04.981 --> 1:13:06.714
Oh!

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:09.016
<i> Pat,</i>

1:13:09.018 --> 1:13:10.685
I'm sorry. It's the pressure.

1:13:10.687 --> 1:13:12.019
I'll be better once
we make the playoffs.

1:13:12.021 --> 1:13:13.771
- We love your dad

1:13:13.772 --> 1:13:15.522
but we're not allowed to
let him treat us like this.

1:13:17.176 --> 1:13:18.826
- What are you doing?
- I need the keys.

1:13:18.828 --> 1:13:21.162
- What, are you going to take
the kids out in the cold?

1:13:21.164 --> 1:13:22.697
- I need the goddamn keys!

1:13:29.606 --> 1:13:30.471
- There's the fucking keys.

1:13:30.473 --> 1:13:32.307
- Oh, Terry!

1:13:32.308 --> 1:13:34.142
- I told you I'll be better
once we make the playoffs.

1:13:34.144 --> 1:13:35.076
- Jerry, let's go.

1:13:35.078 --> 1:13:36.778
Come on, honey. Come on.

1:13:51.461 --> 1:13:53.694
<i> Boston is out of the playoffs!</i>

1:13:53.696 --> 1:13:56.497
<i> Their loss is Newfoundland's</i>
<i> gain as India beer presents</i>

1:13:56.499 --> 1:14:00.001
<i> the boys from Boston</i>
<i>from the brewers of India Beer.</i>

1:14:07.544 --> 1:14:08.943
<i> Nobody can get a thing</i>

1:14:08.945 --> 1:14:10.912
<i> past Hall tonight</i>
<i> as Detroit dominates</i>

1:14:10.914 --> 1:14:13.514
<i> the Leafs in round one.</i>

1:14:13.516 --> 1:14:16.184
<i> Everyone thought Adams</i>
<i> was crazy to trade Sawchuk.</i>

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:18.586
<i> Maybe he knew</i>
<i> what he had in Hall</i>

1:14:18.587 --> 1:14:20.987
<i>more than he knew what Sawchuk's</i>
<i> battered body could give.</i>

1:14:25.995 --> 1:14:27.829
- Come on, guys.

1:14:27.831 --> 1:14:29.630
Let's get in the spirit.

1:14:29.632 --> 1:14:32.467
We're making 25
bucks a game here.

1:14:32.469 --> 1:14:34.068
It's not playoff money but

1:14:34.070 --> 1:14:36.137
<i> it'll get us through</i>
<i> to next season.</i>

1:14:36.139 --> 1:14:38.606
<i> So let's have some fun!</i>

1:14:42.479 --> 1:14:44.279
Well, it looks like

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:46.080
we're playing in the great
<i> outdoors tonight.</i>

1:14:49.085 --> 1:14:51.586
- Let's make the
playoffs next year.

1:14:53.990 --> 1:14:55.623
Hey.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:57.492
Goalie goes first.

1:15:02.131 --> 1:15:04.198
<i>Going to show</i>
<i>us them there fancy moves, boys,</i>

1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.000
<i> or what?</i>

1:15:20.583 --> 1:15:22.783
<i>Terry, keep your</i>
<i> fingers off the screen.</i>

1:15:44.741 --> 1:15:48.009
- You gotta look
after your goalie.

1:15:48.011 --> 1:15:50.545
Whew.

1:15:51.814 --> 1:15:55.049
Who comes out to
see a game like this?

1:15:57.620 --> 1:16:00.154
You heard
anything from Pat?

1:16:04.627 --> 1:16:07.995
Well, good game.

1:16:19.642 --> 1:16:21.809
<i>Good, leave</i>
<i> it there, leave it there.</i>

1:16:21.811 --> 1:16:24.178
<i> Come on, here, here, here!</i>

1:16:28.585 --> 1:16:30.251
Hey, hey!

1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:32.286
You want your fucking shot?

1:16:32.288 --> 1:16:33.821
<i>Hold it,</i>
<i> hang on, hang on.</i>

1:16:33.823 --> 1:16:34.922
- You want your fucking shot?

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:35.890
<i>Hang on, hang on.</i>

1:16:35.892 --> 1:16:37.758
Terry, Terry.

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.760
Look, that guy got 11
older brothers, all right?

1:16:39.762 --> 1:16:41.195
He gets a bit competitive.

1:16:41.197 --> 1:16:43.364
Boys, it's an
exhibition, all right.

1:16:43.366 --> 1:16:45.232
It's supposed
to be a bit of fun.

1:16:45.234 --> 1:16:47.835
Keep the shots
down, for Christ's sake.

1:17:05.388 --> 1:17:08.022
Good game, Terry.
Thanks for that.

1:17:10.927 --> 1:17:12.960
- Wolves out there?

1:17:12.962 --> 1:17:13.928
<i> - Nah.</i>

1:17:13.930 --> 1:17:16.230
Moose, bear. N'ar wolf.

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:21.902
- Seems like a
place for wolves.

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:25.940
- You should
come see my ice.

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:33.748
<i> All right, Terry,</i>
<i> you gotta tell me:</i>

1:17:33.750 --> 1:17:35.049
Wings, Habs.

1:17:35.051 --> 1:17:36.651
Is it true if they're
on the same train

1:17:36.653 --> 1:17:38.319
they gotta put a
dining car in between 'em?

1:17:38.321 --> 1:17:39.720
- You wouldn't let
them hunt together.

1:17:40.890 --> 1:17:42.390
- That's madness.

1:17:42.392 --> 1:17:44.191
- Thanks.

1:17:58.074 --> 1:18:00.041
- Yeah, my youngster did that.

1:18:00.043 --> 1:18:02.843
It's actually of my father.

1:18:02.845 --> 1:18:05.913
He taught me everything
I know about fishing.

1:18:06.282 --> 1:18:08.449
Lost him at sea.

1:18:09.018 --> 1:18:11.318
- Boat sunk or...?

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:14.455
<i> - Well, he was a</i>
<i> swiler, a sealer</i>

1:18:14.457 --> 1:18:16.390
<i> and, uh,</i>

1:18:17.727 --> 1:18:20.194
they would take the boats out

1:18:20.196 --> 1:18:22.129
and when the pack
ice was thick enough,

1:18:22.131 --> 1:18:24.699
they would just walk
miles and miles and miles.

1:18:24.701 --> 1:18:28.102
Back in those times,
maybe for days.

1:18:28.104 --> 1:18:31.472
And this one time,
they were out pretty far

1:18:31.474 --> 1:18:33.941
<i> and a blizzard came in</i>

1:18:33.943 --> 1:18:35.776
<i> and 120 of 'em got trapped,</i>

1:18:35.778 --> 1:18:37.912
couldn't make a
move for two days,

1:18:37.914 --> 1:18:40.214
and they didn't have
the right gear on,

1:18:40.216 --> 1:18:42.283
they didn't have
anything to make a fire with.

1:18:42.285 --> 1:18:46.187
<i> Just out in the</i>
<i> blizzard, waiting, right.</i>

1:18:46.189 --> 1:18:47.288
- Jesus.

1:18:49.625 --> 1:18:51.959
- The ones who survived were the
ones who kept moving, you know.

1:18:51.961 --> 1:18:54.395
They said that they, uh,

1:18:54.397 --> 1:18:56.430
that they would

1:18:56.432 --> 1:18:59.166
chew icicles off each
other's faces just to

1:18:59.168 --> 1:19:02.403
<i> just to keep from</i>
<i> being overtaken by the ice.</i>

1:19:03.339 --> 1:19:06.006
I was in the crowd
when the boat came in.

1:19:06.008 --> 1:19:08.776
And they brought
the corpses off and

1:19:08.778 --> 1:19:12.179
they were still frozen in
the positions that they were in

1:19:12.181 --> 1:19:15.082
when they<i> perished,</i>
<i> right, how they found them.</i>

1:19:15.451 --> 1:19:16.984
<i> Many of them</i>

1:19:16.986 --> 1:19:18.753
hunched over in prayer.

1:19:21.057 --> 1:19:23.023
Pop was one of them.

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:27.795
- Yeah, there's hard ways
to make a living in this world.

1:19:28.531 --> 1:19:30.998
<i> - Yeah, but that said,</i>
<i> he was the finest kind of man.</i>

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.868
Good to his family,
quick with a joke.

1:19:35.271 --> 1:19:38.005
<i> Enjoyed his time</i>
<i> on earth, I think.</i>

1:19:38.007 --> 1:19:40.307
<i> I suppose there's not</i>
much more you can ask than that.

1:20:01.130 --> 1:20:04.231
- What size are your,
uh, your feet, Phil?

1:20:04.233 --> 1:20:06.233
<i> - What?</i>

1:20:07.403 --> 1:20:09.503
- I'm going to
leave these with you.

1:20:09.505 --> 1:20:10.404
- Your skates.

1:20:10.406 --> 1:20:12.072
<i> - Yeah.</i>

1:20:12.074 --> 1:20:13.841
- I don't like
the Habs that much.

1:20:13.843 --> 1:20:15.109
<i> - Oh, fuck hockey.</i>

1:20:15.111 --> 1:20:17.077
I mean, nothing hinges
on hockey, does it?

1:20:17.079 --> 1:20:20.247
It's hardly life or death.

1:20:21.918 --> 1:20:25.519
I'm sick as a dog,
I'm exhausted all the time.

1:20:28.157 --> 1:20:31.358
So do you want the skates 'cause
I'll throw 'em down the hole?

1:20:33.896 --> 1:20:36.397
- Well, there's no need
to startle the fish.

1:21:22.011 --> 1:21:24.011
- I quit.

1:21:24.013 --> 1:21:25.412
I'm out.

1:21:25.414 --> 1:21:28.282
- I heard on the radio.

1:21:32.622 --> 1:21:35.122
- I was wondering

1:21:35.124 --> 1:21:38.559
if you'd still like to live
in a railway car with me?

1:21:45.534 --> 1:21:48.135
- You're lucky I'm a Catholic,
Terry, I swear to God.

1:21:48.137 --> 1:21:51.105
- Good one. Come here.

1:21:52.341 --> 1:21:54.575
Here.

1:21:54.577 --> 1:21:57.544
They're expensive.
Be careful. I'm coming around.

1:21:57.546 --> 1:21:59.046
- Jesus.

1:22:05.621 --> 1:22:09.123
- Okay, okay. Come here,
come here, Jerry.

1:22:10.993 --> 1:22:12.593
- You gonna send
that one to your dad?

1:22:12.595 --> 1:22:15.229
- Yeah. "Look, Anne,
Terry raised a pussy."

1:22:19.535 --> 1:22:20.701
- Where's his hat, Terry?

1:22:20.703 --> 1:22:22.269
- Oh, it's in
the car. He's fine.

1:22:22.271 --> 1:22:23.788
- Okay.

1:22:23.789 --> 1:22:25.306
- How's she doing?
- Good.

1:22:25.308 --> 1:22:27.125
- Good.

1:22:27.126 --> 1:22:28.943
- All right, here we go.
<i>- Get her in there.</i>

1:22:28.945 --> 1:22:30.577
- Ahh.
<i>- She's cold.</i>

1:22:30.579 --> 1:22:32.680
- That's much better, right?

1:22:33.716 --> 1:22:36.083
- All right, here we go.

1:22:36.085 --> 1:22:37.584
- Ooh.

1:22:37.586 --> 1:22:40.554
- Up you go.

1:22:40.556 --> 1:22:42.423
Why don't we
get outta here?

1:22:42.425 --> 1:22:44.408
- Huh?

1:22:44.409 --> 1:22:46.392
- I don't know.
Let's go to California.

1:22:46.395 --> 1:22:48.262
We can do whatever
we want, can't we?

1:22:48.264 --> 1:22:49.730
No one's telling me
where I gotta live anymore.

1:22:49.732 --> 1:22:52.099
- That's true.

1:22:52.100 --> 1:22:54.467
<i> - But how would Santa's</i>
sleigh ever get to us?

1:22:57.389 --> 1:22:59.573
- That's a good point, son.
That's a very good point.

1:22:59.575 --> 1:23:02.509
We're going to talk about
that at home, okay? Okay.

1:23:04.213 --> 1:23:06.313
<i>Ah, warmer? Yeah.</i>

1:23:06.315 --> 1:23:09.984
- Over my dead body. Oh,
that back-stabbing Ted Lindsay

1:23:09.986 --> 1:23:11.719
is behind this union crap.

1:23:11.721 --> 1:23:14.421
And one of those fucks
thought it'd be hilarious

1:23:14.423 --> 1:23:16.156
to put a dead cat
on my car engine.

1:23:16.158 --> 1:23:17.691
Didn't see it
for three days.

1:23:17.693 --> 1:23:20.294
- Jack Adams wasn't fond
of the Player's Union,

1:23:20.296 --> 1:23:23.530
but when he unloaded
all the offending players,

1:23:23.532 --> 1:23:26.266
he was left with
quite a deficit.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:28.335
- I want to find
out every one of them's

1:23:28.337 --> 1:23:29.770
behind this union bullshit.

1:23:29.772 --> 1:23:32.072
I'll trade
'em all to Siberia.

1:23:32.074 --> 1:23:34.608
- He was out.

1:23:34.610 --> 1:23:37.544
And it would have
been a good career.

1:23:37.546 --> 1:23:40.247
But Jack was in trouble

1:23:41.183 --> 1:23:45.219
and he knew that he could get
anything he wanted out of him.

1:23:53.229 --> 1:23:55.496
- My father said you didn't
show up for work today.

1:24:05.408 --> 1:24:07.207
- Hello.

1:24:19.055 --> 1:24:20.521
Okay.

1:24:21.390 --> 1:24:23.057
Yeah.

1:24:25.728 --> 1:24:29.229
<i>Catchers in</i>

1:26:27.516 --> 1:26:30.617
You liking the city?

1:26:30.619 --> 1:26:33.287
Good. I just want to
give you a little intro,

1:26:33.289 --> 1:26:34.655
let you know how I coach

1:26:34.657 --> 1:26:37.624
in case it's different
than what you're used to.

1:26:37.626 --> 1:26:39.826
Some fellas run their teams
like dog teams.

1:26:39.828 --> 1:26:41.495
I don't.

1:26:41.497 --> 1:26:44.831
We're goin' with
two goalies this year,

1:26:44.833 --> 1:26:47.234
not to, uh, set you
against each other

1:26:47.236 --> 1:26:49.203
but to take the
pressure off.

1:26:49.205 --> 1:26:51.672
Get the best
out of both of ya'.

1:26:51.674 --> 1:26:54.942
Johnny gets that.
He's a good guy.

1:27:05.688 --> 1:27:07.554
- Hey, Bower.

1:27:07.556 --> 1:27:09.256
Nice shoes.

1:27:09.258 --> 1:27:10.490
- Thanks, man.

1:27:10.492 --> 1:27:14.294
- Can I see that one?
Just the one closest to me.

1:27:14.296 --> 1:27:15.412
<i> - This one?</i>

1:27:15.413 --> 1:27:16.529
- Yeah, just pass it to me.

1:27:18.334 --> 1:27:19.884
- Come on, guys.

1:27:19.885 --> 1:27:21.435
<i> - Hey, Johnny,</i> Johnny.

1:27:21.437 --> 1:27:23.904
Why'd you do
that to your shoes?

1:27:30.913 --> 1:27:32.613
- Ooh!

1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:54.668
- You okay?

1:27:54.670 --> 1:27:56.403
You're next.

1:27:57.740 --> 1:27:59.706
<i> Toronto's a team of old bones.</i>

1:27:59.708 --> 1:28:01.675
<i> You got to wonder</i>
<i> if they can square up</i>

1:28:01.677 --> 1:28:03.877
<i>against the youthful Canadiens?</i>

1:28:03.879 --> 1:28:06.913
- Stop-stop-stop-stop.

1:28:07.683 --> 1:28:10.917
Ah, that's good,
that's good.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:16.990
No-no-no. Johnny's
playin' way better.

1:28:16.992 --> 1:28:18.558
- Yeah, right. You just
want another night off,

1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:19.726
you lazy bugger.

1:28:23.899 --> 1:28:26.667
Big game.

1:28:26.669 --> 1:28:28.836
C'mon, coach.

1:28:28.837 --> 1:28:31.004
Elbow's shot. Vertebrae's
ruptured-- You saw me last game.

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:34.741
- Have you read what the
press is saying about you?

1:28:34.743 --> 1:28:37.678
You're playing like the
Sawchuk of old. A man possessed.

1:28:38.781 --> 1:28:40.580
I'm not worried.

1:28:43.319 --> 1:28:45.452
This is what we live for.

1:28:45.454 --> 1:28:46.787
- Thanks for the
pep talk, Coach.

1:28:46.789 --> 1:28:48.021
<i> - Yeah.</i>

1:28:49.058 --> 1:28:50.590
What the fuck?

1:28:56.498 --> 1:28:59.366
<i> Grow up. I got a team</i>
<i> of geriatrics here</i>

1:28:59.368 --> 1:29:02.769
and it's still a
damn nursery school.

1:29:02.771 --> 1:29:04.671
Now, listen up:

1:29:08.344 --> 1:29:12.379
it might be<i> game six but</i>
<i> for us it's game seven, boys.</i>

1:29:12.381 --> 1:29:14.781
<i> This is our home.</i>

1:29:14.783 --> 1:29:17.551
We go back to Montreal
tomorrow, all bets are off.

1:29:17.553 --> 1:29:20.387
We can win it tonight.

1:29:24.526 --> 1:29:26.560
Let the goalie go first.

1:29:50.386 --> 1:29:51.918
<i> Unbelievable save.</i>

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:53.653
<i> Sawchuk is making up</i>
<i> the game as he goes</i>

1:29:53.655 --> 1:29:55.589
<i> and it's electrifying</i>
<i> here at Maple Leaf Gardens</i>

1:29:55.591 --> 1:29:57.023
<i> at the moment.</i>

1:29:57.025 --> 1:29:59.926
<i> Here we go for the face-off.</i>
<i> 50 seconds on the clock,</i>

1:29:59.928 --> 1:30:03.964
<i> Stanley talking to Kelly</i>
<i> and we're ready to go.</i>

1:30:07.035 --> 1:30:08.568
<i> The puck is dropped,</i>

1:30:08.570 --> 1:30:09.936
<i> Kelly gets it to Pulford</i>

1:30:09.938 --> 1:30:12.739
<i> who puts it on the tape</i>
<i> for Armstrong who fires.</i>

1:30:12.741 --> 1:30:15.976
<i> And into the empty net.</i>
<i> It's a goal!</i>

1:30:15.978 --> 1:30:18.011
<i> And a wild finish!</i>

1:30:18.013 --> 1:30:20.080
<i> The players are jumping</i>
<i> out onto the ice.</i>

1:30:20.082 --> 1:30:24.151
<i> The Leafs have won the Cup!!</i>
<i> The Leafs have won the Cup!!</i>

1:31:37.226 --> 1:31:41.495
<i>Sawchuk! Sawchuk!</i>
<i> Sawchuk! Sawchuk!</i>

1:31:47.269 --> 1:31:50.270
- 36 years you gave them.

1:31:51.006 --> 1:31:52.639
What they did is
damned disrespectful.

1:31:52.641 --> 1:31:53.840
- What do you mean?

1:31:53.842 --> 1:31:55.742
You're making it sound
like they let me go?

1:31:55.744 --> 1:31:57.611
- Oh. No, I just--

1:31:57.613 --> 1:32:01.081
- Sons of bitches.

1:32:03.085 --> 1:32:04.651
- You want another one?

1:32:04.653 --> 1:32:06.887
- No, thanks.

1:32:10.759 --> 1:32:13.894
I don't know if I ever
told you this but, uh,

1:32:13.896 --> 1:32:17.797
I grew up working in
rat-infested grain elevators

1:32:17.799 --> 1:32:19.833
for 22 cents a day

1:32:20.636 --> 1:32:22.669
saving for skates.

1:32:23.839 --> 1:32:26.039
No-one should be that poor.

1:32:26.041 --> 1:32:28.108
All you mind is money.

1:32:29.144 --> 1:32:33.246
You'd chew someone's arm off to
climb out of the hole you're in.

1:32:33.949 --> 1:32:35.782
- Glad you did.
You changed the game.

1:32:37.786 --> 1:32:39.920
- When I got to Detroit,
they were bankrupt.

1:32:39.922 --> 1:32:42.923
I couldn't have
fucked it up any more.

1:32:43.725 --> 1:32:45.959
Picking players
out of training camp,

1:32:45.961 --> 1:32:48.261
watching them grow...

1:32:48.897 --> 1:32:51.031
That was the stuff.

1:32:54.236 --> 1:32:56.770
- You were like
a father to us.

1:32:59.241 --> 1:33:02.709
I kept that job 36
years off your backs.

1:33:02.711 --> 1:33:05.312
Some father.

1:33:05.314 --> 1:33:08.281
If I were your
father, I'd say this:

1:33:09.017 --> 1:33:11.151
you can leave the game now,

1:33:11.153 --> 1:33:13.320
in fine style.

1:33:14.222 --> 1:33:16.723
You're not
getting any younger.

1:33:17.159 --> 1:33:20.727
Track those kids of
yours down, enjoy 'em.

1:33:20.729 --> 1:33:23.229
- I tried that.

1:33:23.231 --> 1:33:26.232
- Terry, you don't want
to be some old soldier

1:33:26.234 --> 1:33:29.269
searching for a
new war. Trust me.

1:33:32.908 --> 1:33:37.210
- That's not what you said when
you pulled me back to Detroit.

1:33:37.212 --> 1:33:39.746
Ice is thicker
than blood, you said.

1:33:41.049 --> 1:33:43.783
- You fell for that
one too.

1:33:57.699 --> 1:34:01.034
- I never goddamn did
any of this for you.

1:34:04.973 --> 1:34:09.275
I never did a fucking
ounce of this for you.

1:34:13.315 --> 1:34:15.815
Or anybody else.

1:34:23.392 --> 1:34:25.225
- Yeah.

1:34:27.796 --> 1:34:30.296
Why don't you give Pat a call?

1:34:30.298 --> 1:34:32.699
See if she'll
take you back home.

1:34:32.701 --> 1:34:34.267
- Home?

1:34:35.671 --> 1:34:37.370
<i> - Yeah.</i>

1:34:39.274 --> 1:34:42.108
- You saw me out there.

1:34:42.110 --> 1:34:45.345
I can play this game forever.

1:34:46.148 --> 1:34:49.149
<i>Folks, get ready</i>
<i> for six new hockey teams</i>

1:34:49.151 --> 1:34:51.151
<i> as the league</i>
<i> approves expansion.</i>

1:34:51.153 --> 1:34:53.987
<i> Oakland and LA</i>
<i> round out the new six.</i>

1:34:53.989 --> 1:34:56.923
<i> Strange to think of playing</i>
<i> hockey in the heat, isn't it?</i>

1:34:56.925 --> 1:35:00.326
<i> That's gotta be on Mr. Terry</i>
<i> Sawchuk's mind as the Leafs,</i>

1:35:00.328 --> 1:35:02.328
<i> only allowed to</i>
<i> protect one goaltender,</i>

1:35:02.330 --> 1:35:04.397
<i> choose Johnny Bower over him.</i>

1:35:04.399 --> 1:35:07.067
- I'm excited to be part of
the Los Angeles organization

1:35:07.069 --> 1:35:09.002
and look forward to playing
the best hockey of my career

1:35:09.004 --> 1:35:11.071
with the LA Kings.

1:35:25.153 --> 1:35:27.854
<i> I sure am excited to</i>
<i> be back with the Wings</i>

1:35:27.856 --> 1:35:30.290
<i> and look forward to playing</i>
<i> the best hockey of my career</i>

1:35:30.292 --> 1:35:33.359
<i> right back here in Detroit.</i>

1:35:33.361 --> 1:35:36.396
<i> Certainly am looking</i>
<i> forward to being in New York</i>

1:35:36.398 --> 1:35:39.799
<i> playing the best hockey of</i>
<i>my career as a New York Ranger.</i>

1:36:46.401 --> 1:36:49.269
<i> Terry Sawchuk is celebrating</i>

1:36:49.271 --> 1:36:51.871
<i> his 103rd shutout!</i>

1:37:10.058 --> 1:37:12.959
- I gave the kids
some money for cokes.

1:37:14.362 --> 1:37:16.095
- Some Christmas they're having.

1:37:16.097 --> 1:37:18.965
- She's their grandmother.

1:37:18.967 --> 1:37:21.367
Is she lucid?

1:37:22.003 --> 1:37:24.871
- She keeps calling me Mitch.

1:37:24.873 --> 1:37:26.139
- Terry.

1:37:42.290 --> 1:37:44.858
- Why don't we
go to Disneyland.

1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:46.860
Take the kids.

1:37:48.029 --> 1:37:49.896
- Maybe.

1:37:51.066 --> 1:37:53.199
- How could you
live with yourself

1:37:53.201 --> 1:37:55.134
knowing that you missed
their faces the first time

1:37:55.136 --> 1:37:56.536
they saw Mickey Mouse?

1:38:12.988 --> 1:38:15.021
- Your mother's gone.

1:38:15.023 --> 1:38:17.123
I'm sorry.

1:38:35.076 --> 1:38:36.643
- What do I do?

1:39:00.302 --> 1:39:01.634
Giacomin's tired.

1:39:01.636 --> 1:39:04.003
You wanna give him a minute?

1:39:04.472 --> 1:39:07.540
- The last time he was on ice

1:39:07.542 --> 1:39:11.311
was to give the
real goalie a rest.

1:39:16.418 --> 1:39:18.017
- You ready?

1:39:18.019 --> 1:39:21.321
- Yeah, just give me
another minute there, Ref.

1:39:25.493 --> 1:39:27.126
- All right, all right,
wrap it up.

1:39:27.128 --> 1:39:28.995
- Okay.

1:39:37.238 --> 1:39:40.006
- In like a lion, they say.

1:39:47.215 --> 1:39:49.749
- No-no-no-no-no. I paid
that bill two months ago!

1:39:49.751 --> 1:39:51.684
That was the bill
for two months ago!

1:39:51.686 --> 1:39:53.469
The bill comes
every month, man.

1:39:53.470 --> 1:39:55.253
- I want to see these. I'm
getting fucking fleeced here.

1:39:55.256 --> 1:39:57.056
- What do you mean by that?

1:39:57.058 --> 1:39:59.292
- You think I got money?

1:40:01.329 --> 1:40:03.363
What, it's 'cause you'll never
make as much money as me, huh?

1:40:03.365 --> 1:40:07.333
Now, don't walk away!
Hey, hey, don't walk away.

1:40:11.139 --> 1:40:13.172
<i>And so</i>

1:40:13.174 --> 1:40:14.741
<i> I got accustomed</i>
<i> to the view from here.</i>

1:40:14.743 --> 1:40:16.709
<i>Stay low. Stay forward.</i>

1:40:16.711 --> 1:40:19.045
- What were you thinking when
you let that easy one by

1:40:19.047 --> 1:40:20.714
<i> in the third?</i>

1:40:20.715 --> 1:40:22.382
<i>Boys, who do you</i>
<i> think you're talking to here,</i>

1:40:22.384 --> 1:40:23.583
<i> a poet, a fucking philosopher?</i>

1:40:23.585 --> 1:40:25.518
<i> What was I thinkin'?</i>

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:27.253
<i> Sawchuk himself insists</i>

1:40:27.255 --> 1:40:28.621
<i>that fellow Ranger, Ron Stewart</i>

1:40:28.623 --> 1:40:31.724
<i> is not at fault for</i>
<i> his critical condition.</i>

1:40:31.726 --> 1:40:34.060
- We were fighting...

1:40:35.930 --> 1:40:37.797
But all his life Terry took
way worse knocks than that

1:40:37.799 --> 1:40:40.500
and he always bounced
right back.

1:40:41.603 --> 1:40:43.436
<i> It's all just</i>
<i> like a bad dream.</i>

1:40:43.438 --> 1:40:45.105
<i> One can only pray</i>

1:40:45.106 --> 1:40:46.773
<i> that the Red Wings'</i>
<i> famous goalie will not succumb</i>

1:40:46.775 --> 1:40:48.775
<i> to a ruptured gall bladder</i>
<i> sustained in the fight.</i>

1:40:48.777 --> 1:40:50.676
<i>... repeat the</i>
<i> season you had last year</i>

1:40:50.678 --> 1:40:51.711
<i> getting</i>
<i> to you?</i>

1:40:54.082 --> 1:40:56.482
- That's all I have
to say about him,

1:40:56.484 --> 1:40:58.051
I guess.

1:40:59.187 --> 1:41:01.654
Get me another.

1:41:03.291 --> 1:41:06.692
And how about
one for my friend?

1:41:08.430 --> 1:41:10.563
<i>We should get</i>
<i> some food into you, Red.</i>

1:41:12.233 --> 1:41:15.735
- It was something when, uh,

1:41:15.737 --> 1:41:18.237
above that door in the forum

1:41:18.239 --> 1:41:21.107
when you saw that sign

1:41:21.242 --> 1:41:23.676
that said
"Hockey Tonight."

1:41:23.678 --> 1:41:25.278
<i> Boy,</i> when that organist

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:28.748
began to hit
those notes,

1:41:28.750 --> 1:41:32.351
just like a charge
went through the crowd and...

1:41:32.353 --> 1:41:35.555
Everybody felt it,
I felt it, I felt it.

1:41:36.758 --> 1:41:38.858
It was magic.

1:41:39.761 --> 1:41:41.561
<i>In this tunnel,</i>

1:41:41.563 --> 1:41:43.596
<i> at this river,</i>

1:41:43.598 --> 1:41:46.766
<i> in the absence of time,</i>

1:41:46.768 --> 1:41:49.368

<i> been everything</i>

1:41:49.370 --> 1:41:51.504
<i> I dreamed of being.</i>

1:41:54.109 --> 1:41:56.409
<i>What was</i>
<i>going through your mind, Terry?</i>

1:41:56.411 --> 1:41:57.810
<i> - What was going</i>
<i> through my mind?</i>

1:41:57.812 --> 1:41:59.345
<i> Stop the fuckin' puck! Jesus.</i>

1:41:59.347 --> 1:42:02.882
<i> What would you want</i>
<i> going through my mind?</i>

1:42:02.884 --> 1:42:05.618
<i> And the thought hits:</i>

1:42:05.620 --> 1:42:08.321
<i> at one time or another</i>

1:42:08.323 --> 1:42:10.823

1:42:15.663 --> 1:42:18.831
<i> the guy you'd leave</i>
<i> behind to guard your--</i>

1:42:18.833 --> 1:42:20.900
<i> your ice-cold home.</i>

1:42:20.902 --> 1:42:23.603
<i> That cuts a bit.</i>

1:42:23.605 --> 1:42:25.638
<i> Cuts and comforts.</i>

1:42:26.574 --> 1:42:28.808
<i> Maybe I was the guy.</i>

1:42:29.611 --> 1:42:32.445
<i> Maybe I was him.</i>

1:42:47.795 --> 1:42:48.928
- No goal!

1:43:15.290 --> 1:43:18.257
- And, uh,

1:43:18.259 --> 1:43:19.825
joke's on you.

1:43:19.827 --> 1:43:22.695
I don't have any friends.

1:43:26.601 --> 1:43:29.468
<i>The winners</i>
