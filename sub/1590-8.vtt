00:01.668 --> 00:06.038
â™ª

00:06.040 --> 00:07.439
<i>Spike: There you are, rarity.</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:08.374
That's the last of your bags.

00:08.376 --> 00:12.578
Actually spike, I've got one
last pile of bags over there.

00:14.647 --> 00:17.149
Won't you be a dear?

00:18.151 --> 00:21.186
Sure. I'll be a dear.

00:21.188 --> 00:21.720
<i>(grunt)</i>

00:21.722 --> 00:25.324
An entire week in the
fabulous city of manehattan,

00:25.326 --> 00:28.761
Plus all of my very best
friends there with me!

00:28.763 --> 00:30.129
Of course, we'd
all come along

00:30.131 --> 00:32.564
To support you during
fashion week, rarity.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.033
Not that you'll
need it.

00:34.035 --> 00:34.767
We're sure
you'll win.

00:34.769 --> 00:37.669
Ooh, I can't begin to
tell you how excited I am

00:37.671 --> 00:40.506
That you'll all
be there with me. However,

00:40.508 --> 00:45.244
Perhaps
I can show you...

00:46.713 --> 00:47.446
What's that?

00:47.448 --> 00:50.482
Oh, oh, oh, I know!
A paper fan!

00:50.484 --> 00:51.417
No.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.184
It's a magic trick!

00:52.186 --> 00:54.219
You know, where I pick a card
and remember what it is

00:54.221 --> 00:57.322
And then put it back in the deck
so you can't look at it and--

00:57.324 --> 01:01.660
These are tickets to the
hottest musical on bridleway.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.328
You couldn't mean
hinny of the hills,

01:03.330 --> 01:06.832
Because that show's been
sold out for months...

01:06.834 --> 01:08.167
Or could you?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.501
I could. I do.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.770
Oh rarity, you didn't
have to do that.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.739
But since you did...

01:13.741 --> 01:15.808
<i>(cheers)</i>

01:15.810 --> 01:17.476
This trip is fun already!

01:17.478 --> 01:19.411
I love jumping up and down!

01:19.413 --> 01:20.712
Wheee!

01:23.583 --> 01:27.352
<i>â™ª my little pony,</i>
<i>my little pony â™ª</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:29.154
<i>â™ª aaaaahhh!</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:29.855
<i>â™ª (upbeat)</i>

01:29.857 --> 01:31.256
<i>â™ª my little pony</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.859
<i>â™ª I used to wonder what</i>
<i>friendship could be â™ª</i>

01:33.861 --> 01:35.394
<i>â™ª my little pony</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:38.397
<i>â™ª until you all shared</i>
<i>its magic with me â™ª</i>

01:38.399 --> 01:39.398
<i>â™ª big adventure</i>

01:39.400 --> 01:40.299
<i>â™ª tons of fun.</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:41.300
<i>â™ª a beautiful heart</i>

01:41.302 --> 01:42.434
<i>â™ª faithful and strong</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:43.469
<i>â™ª sharing kindness</i>

01:43.471 --> 01:44.369
<i>â™ª it's an easy feat</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:46.672
<i>â™ª and magic makes it</i>
<i>all complete â™ª</i>

01:46.674 --> 01:48.273
<i>â™ª my little ponies</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:52.277
<i>â™ª do you know you're all</i>
<i>my very best friends? â™ª</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:54.513
â™ª

01:59.586 --> 02:00.652
â™ª

02:00.654 --> 02:03.689
<i>(train chugging)</i>

02:03.691 --> 02:07.759
â™ª

02:07.761 --> 02:08.727
<i>Rarity: Come along, ponies.</i>

02:08.729 --> 02:11.797
I found us a place to stay only
a block from the train station,

02:11.799 --> 02:15.567
In the very heart of
this glorious metropolis!

02:15.569 --> 02:18.670
â™ª

02:18.672 --> 02:19.505
<i>Applejack: Hey, look!</i>

02:19.507 --> 02:22.174
There's the theater where
hinny of the hills is playing!

02:22.176 --> 02:24.243
<i>All: Cool!</i>

02:24.245 --> 02:24.910
<i>Twilight: Wow, rarity.</i>

02:24.912 --> 02:27.279
<i>How'd you manage to get us</i>
<i>seats for tomorrow night?</i>

02:27.281 --> 02:29.748
I gave some designs to
the costume designer,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.151
So he pulled a few strings.

02:32.153 --> 02:32.518
Cool!

02:32.520 --> 02:36.622
Rarity: That is makes manehattan
<i>so splendid and amazing.</i>

02:36.624 --> 02:38.223
<i>You do something</i>
<i>nice for somepony,</i>

02:38.225 --> 02:41.360
And you never know when they'll
<i>do something nice for you.</i>

02:41.362 --> 02:43.862
<i>Applejack: So then you can</i>
<i>do something nice for us.</i>

02:43.864 --> 02:46.465
Like get us in to see
hinny of the hills.

02:46.467 --> 02:50.402
Which is only the best
musical in all of equestria!

02:50.404 --> 02:52.671
It must be good if rainbow
dash is impressed.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.741
Normally, she doesn't
even <i> like</i> musicals.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.408
I know.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.244
Ponies just bursting into
song in random places

02:59.246 --> 03:01.713
At the drop of a hat.
Who does that?

03:01.715 --> 03:05.384
<i>â™ª oh manehattan,</i>
<i>what you do to me. â™ª</i>

03:05.386 --> 03:08.554
<i>â™ª such a huge</i>
<i>bustling community. â™ª</i>

03:08.556 --> 03:16.929
â™ª and there's always opportunity
<i>to do the friendly thing. â™ª</i>

03:16.931 --> 03:18.430
â™ª

03:18.432 --> 03:21.967
<i>â™ª if some are grouchy,</i>
<i>pay no mind. â™ª</i>

03:21.969 --> 03:25.637
<i>â™ª surprise instead with</i>
<i>something kind. â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª lo-and-behold you</i>

03:29.977 --> 03:34.513
<i>â™ª a smile is what</i>
<i>you'll bring. â™ª</i>

03:34.515 --> 03:35.514
Welcome to the mane fair hotel.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.217
Please allow me to take those
bags to your room for you.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.586
Only if you'll accept
this gratuity first.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.454
Oh ho ho! I'll
get your change.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.922
Do keep it all.
I insist.

03:43.924 --> 03:51.663
<i>â™ª generosity! I'm here to</i>
<i>show all that I can give â™ª</i>

03:51.665 --> 03:55.767
<i>â™ª generosity! I'm here</i>

03:55.769 --> 04:01.440
<i>â™ª just sit back and</i>
<i>watch how I live â™ª</i>

04:01.442 --> 04:02.774
After you.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.909
Why, thank you.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.611
Please take mine.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.678
Wow. Ok!

04:06.680 --> 04:09.848
<i>â™ª some may say, rarity,</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:13.552
<i>â™ª don't be so</i>
<i>big-hearted and bold. â™ª</i>

04:13.554 --> 04:17.689
<i>â™ª treating strangers</i>
<i>like they're friends â™ª</i>

04:17.691 --> 04:24.630
<i>â™ª this town's too</i>
<i>big and cold. â™ª</i>

04:24.632 --> 04:32.537
<i>â™ª but this is how I play my</i>
<i>cards; I'm not about to fold. â™ª</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:37.709
<i>â™ª where I see a frown,</i>
<i>I go to town. â™ª</i>

04:37.711 --> 04:40.545
<i>â™ª call me the smile patrol.</i>

04:40.547 --> 04:41.513
â™ª

04:41.515 --> 04:45.317
<i>â™ª oh manehattan,</i>
<i>what you do to us. â™ª</i>

04:45.319 --> 04:48.854
<i>â™ª what if you find a</i>
<i>gloomy gus? â™ª</i>

04:48.856 --> 04:52.924
â™ª it's no intimidating thing.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.028
<i>â™ª just be kind</i>
<i>without a fuss. â™ª</i>

04:56.030 --> 05:03.669
<i>â™ª generosity! I'm here to</i>
<i>show all that I can do â™ª</i>

05:03.671 --> 05:07.606
â™ª generosity! You are the key

05:07.608 --> 05:14.546
<i>â™ª manehattan I'm</i>
<i>here just for you. â™ª</i>

05:14.548 --> 05:17.749
<i>â™ª just for you.</i>

05:17.751 --> 05:20.519
<i>(song ends)</i>

05:24.590 --> 05:27.092
To think my dresses
could soon be displayed

05:27.094 --> 05:29.461
On the most glamorous
shopping thoroughfare

05:29.463 --> 05:32.064
Of the most glamorous
city in equestria.

05:32.066 --> 05:35.400
Oh! It would be my
dream come true.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.036
Is there anything left to
do we can help you with?

05:38.038 --> 05:39.571
Hm. Nothing I can think of.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.673
The dresses are all
completely finished,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.875
All made from a
fabulous new fabric

05:43.877 --> 05:45.010
I've been developing
for months.

05:45.012 --> 05:49.848
Stretchy but not clingy,
shimmery but not showy.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.749
Sounds amazing.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.819
There's nothing left for me to
do but check in at the runway

05:53.821 --> 05:56.021
With my dresses by
two this afternoon.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.656
That's funny, because
that clock over there

05:57.658 --> 06:00.492
Makes it seem like that's
only ten minutes from now.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.860
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

06:01.862 --> 06:03.628
<i>(rainfall)</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:04.563
Oh, my ribbons and threads!

06:04.565 --> 06:06.665
And the runway ballroom is
all the way across town.

06:06.667 --> 06:11.370
If I don't get there,
I'm disqualified! Taxi!

06:11.372 --> 06:15.574
Oh no! We've got to help
her find a cab now!

06:15.576 --> 06:16.675
I'm on it.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.744
Hey buddy, is this cab taken?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.847
The line ends
back there, buddy!

06:21.849 --> 06:22.948
Huh? What?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.617
Does everypony in
this town want a cab?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.419
I'm afraid getting a
taxi at this time

06:27.421 --> 06:29.421
Could prove almost
impossible.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.989
Please, won't you let
her have this taxi?

06:30.991 --> 06:34.659
She has somewhere very
important to be right away.

06:34.661 --> 06:35.127
Not likely!

06:35.129 --> 06:37.863
She can get in line
like the rest of us!

06:37.865 --> 06:42.067
<i>(angry shouts)</i>

06:42.069 --> 06:42.901
Oh, it's no use.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.770
The cab drivers just
drive right past

06:44.772 --> 06:47.539
To get to the next
pony in line.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.642
New wheel works
like a charm.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.578
So now which of you nice
folks are hoppin' in?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.448
Fashion runway plaza
in seven minutes.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.449
Can you make it?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.450
Hang on!

06:58.452 --> 06:59.484
Ta ta!

06:59.486 --> 07:01.052
Phew! That was close.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.888
<i>(agreement)</i>

07:03.022 --> 07:05.424
Anypony else got a
sneaking suspicion

07:05.426 --> 07:07.793
We're forgetting something?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.694
The dresses!!

07:12.031 --> 07:13.031
â™ª

07:13.033 --> 07:14.766
Good afternoon. I'm
here for fashion week.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.670
Everypony's gathered in front of
the runway and about to start.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.673
So you'll just have to bring
your dresses along with you

07:21.675 --> 07:23.508
And store them
backstage later.

07:23.510 --> 07:27.446
My dresses? How could I
possibly forget them?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.147
Ah! Ah! Ah!

07:29.149 --> 07:30.949
I'm doomed!

07:31.517 --> 07:32.217
Got 'em right
here, ma'am.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.119
Your friends told me you
need these in a hurry

07:34.121 --> 07:35.787
So I offered to race
them over myself.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.923
"anything for that
nice mare" I told 'em.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.925
<i>You're a life saver!</i>

07:41.727 --> 07:43.595
Whew! I made it!

07:43.597 --> 07:45.730
And with seconds to spare.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.731
Hello, everypony!

07:46.733 --> 07:48.533
Pleased to meet you all.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.469
Rarity, I presume?

07:51.037 --> 07:56.541
You must be prim hemline,
the host of this grand event.

07:56.543 --> 07:56.975
How do you--

07:56.977 --> 07:59.211
Miss rarity, how is it
that all your competitors

07:59.213 --> 08:00.745
Are here half an hour early,

08:00.747 --> 08:03.982
And yet you arrive
seconds before we begin?

08:03.984 --> 08:08.186
Oh, um, heh heh.
Just lucky I guess.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.690
Once we're done here, you're
to finish setting up backstage,

08:11.692 --> 08:15.093
So you'll be ready for your
run-through appointment.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.028
You'll show your
designs last.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.230
We keep to a precise schedule

08:18.232 --> 08:21.867
So let's try to be more than
a few seconds early, hmm?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.869
Tomorrow is the contest
to see which one of you

08:23.871 --> 08:28.073
Gets to stay to meet top
designers all across the city.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.209
The rest of you
must go home early.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.644
So sad.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.080
Dismissed.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.983
I'm so glad you
made it, rarity.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.187
Me too, but everything just
seems to keep working out.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.288
Don't you remember me?

08:43.290 --> 08:47.158
Suri polomare, from the
ponyville knitter's league?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.094
Oh! Yes of course, of course!

08:49.096 --> 08:52.664
I thought you looked familiar
but I couldn't place it.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.732
You haven't been
back in years.

08:53.734 --> 08:58.837
Because I moved here to make it
in the big city. (laugh) ok?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.306
Oh! Good for you, suri!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.875
It's so good to see you.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.710
And now here we are...

09:05.712 --> 09:08.213
Competing. (laugh) ok.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.180
Yes, yes.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.248
Well, good luck.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.116
Oh, I don't need luck.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.285
Would you like a hoof
with your things?

09:13.287 --> 09:15.887
Why thank you so much.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.623
My, your collection is gorgeous!

09:18.625 --> 09:22.627
Oh now, I'm sure your
collection is equally lovely

09:22.629 --> 09:23.695
If not more so.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.264
It's all right, but
nothing like this!

09:26.266 --> 09:27.332
Take my culottes, for example.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.935
They are simply crying out
for just the right accent

09:29.937 --> 09:32.037
But I haven't the
slightest notion where--

09:32.039 --> 09:32.637
<i>(gasp)</i>

09:32.639 --> 09:36.675
Actually, just a touch of this
fabric could be perfect with it.

09:36.677 --> 09:40.579
Hey, would you mind terribly
if I took a swatch?

09:40.581 --> 09:41.613
Oh, not at all.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.815
Here, I have loads extra.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.283
You're sure?

09:45.285 --> 09:45.917
Positive.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.986
Well, it's been wonderful
getting caught up

09:47.988 --> 09:49.220
And I don't wish to be rude,

09:49.222 --> 09:51.089
But I need to finish
my preparations

09:51.091 --> 09:54.593
And I am a bit late
as it... Is?

09:56.796 --> 09:58.730
Hello, I'm here
half an hour early

09:58.732 --> 10:02.734
For my run-through appointment,
just the way prim likes.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.803
Get in line over there.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.140
Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.709
Did you make that yourself?

10:10.711 --> 10:14.279
Why yes, it's...
Stretchy but not clingy.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.981
<i>Suri: Shimmery but not showy.</i>

10:15.983 --> 10:18.650
<i>And the entire line is in</i>
<i>this same adorable pattern</i>

10:18.652 --> 10:22.721
<i>That works on everything from</i>
<i>skirts to tops to shoes.</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:23.321
<i>(chuckle)</i>

10:23.323 --> 10:27.225
Bravo! I've never seen
anything like it.

10:28.694 --> 10:31.162
You stole my fabric!

10:31.164 --> 10:34.332
(laugh) I didn't
steal it, ok?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.167
You gave it to me, remember?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.703
I gave you the
fabric for accents,

10:38.705 --> 10:39.871
Not for your whole line!

10:39.873 --> 10:42.307
And how could you possibly
make all those outfits

10:42.309 --> 10:43.808
Out of it so fast?

10:43.810 --> 10:44.676
Fast! Ha!

10:44.678 --> 10:47.345
<i>Coco pommel here took</i>
<i>practically forever.</i>

10:47.347 --> 10:49.681
<i>Nearly got me</i>
<i>completely disqualified.</i>

10:49.683 --> 10:51.282
Well, I wanted to
make sure you'd win,

10:51.284 --> 10:53.284
So I took the
extra time to--

10:53.286 --> 10:53.852
Quiet!

10:53.854 --> 10:57.322
I pay an assistant to sew and
get coffee, not talk. Ok?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.257
(sob) how could this happen?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.359
Aw sweetie, don't
blame yourself.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.862
It takes some small town
fillies a while to learn

11:03.864 --> 11:07.399
It's everypony for herself
in the big city. Ok?

11:07.401 --> 11:08.700
<i>(sobbing)</i>

11:08.702 --> 11:12.837
I hope you realize how fortunate
you are to have me as a mentor.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.773
Now get me some coffee!

11:15.708 --> 11:18.243
<i>Twilight: Oh my gosh,</i>
<i>what a great afternoon!</i>

11:18.245 --> 11:19.744
<i>That was almost</i>
<i>too much fun.</i>

11:19.746 --> 11:23.715
Better pace yourself, 'cause the
rest of the day is jam packed.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.383
First, there's the
salon appointment

11:25.385 --> 11:26.384
To get our manes done.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.254
Then our fancy dinner
at the far field tavern.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.121
And after that?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.690
All: Hinny of the hills!

11:31.692 --> 11:32.357
<i>(crash)</i>

11:32.359 --> 11:39.230
<i>(giggling)</i>

11:39.232 --> 11:41.066
Is everything ok?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.168
You got the dresses the
bellhop brought you

11:43.170 --> 11:45.070
And everything, right?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.174
<i>(bawling)</i>

11:49.176 --> 11:51.843
But he said he brought them.

11:51.845 --> 11:55.013
<i>And then suri stole them!</i>

11:55.015 --> 11:56.881
I let one of the
other contestants

11:56.883 --> 11:58.149
Use some of my one-of-a-kind
fabric

11:58.151 --> 12:01.286
And then she turned it into a
wardrobe just like mine,

12:01.288 --> 12:04.823
Only now it looks like I'm
the one copying her!

12:04.825 --> 12:09.461
My generosity has
ruined me, I tell you!

12:09.463 --> 12:10.729
Ruined!

12:10.731 --> 12:11.963
<i>(bawling)</i>

12:11.965 --> 12:13.431
Now rarity, whatever went wrong,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.900
We're all here to help
you get through it.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.102
No matter what it takes.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.270
<i>(shouts of agreement)</i>

12:19.272 --> 12:20.271
Come on, rarity, buck up.

12:20.273 --> 12:24.309
All we need is some fabric and
you'll be back in business.

12:26.312 --> 12:35.220
â™ª

12:35.222 --> 12:35.887
<i>(gasp)</i>

12:35.889 --> 12:38.123
This new line is going
to be marvelous!

12:38.125 --> 12:40.258
Perhaps even better
than the last.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.760
It's daring! It's bold!

12:41.762 --> 12:44.229
Perhaps I still have
a chance after all!

12:44.231 --> 12:45.463
<i>(happy sigh)</i>

12:46.899 --> 12:50.969
<i>(humming machines)</i>

12:50.971 --> 13:01.012
â™ª

13:01.014 --> 13:06.117
â™ª

13:06.119 --> 13:07.786
Twilight, sew these
pieces together

13:07.788 --> 13:08.820
According to that
pattern there.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.022
You said if we skipped
dinner at the far field tavern,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.858
You'd order a meal for us to
eat while we keep working.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.860
Don't fret. It will
be here in an hour.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.863
That's not going to
be a problem, is it?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.198
Well...

13:20.200 --> 13:23.802
We're supposed to be watching
hinny of the hills by then.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.303
Oh. I see.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.373
I go out of my way to get
you tickets for a show,

13:28.375 --> 13:29.941
And this is how you repay me?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.877
By abandoning me
in my hour of need?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.017
Fine! Go and see hinny
of the hills tonight.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.252
Then tomorrow morning when you
come to see my fashion show

13:41.254 --> 13:43.822
Without any fashion to show, you
can have more entertainment.

13:43.824 --> 13:48.493
"why look, there's our friend
rarity going down in flames."

13:48.495 --> 13:50.962
"isn't friendship magic?"

13:51.430 --> 13:52.964
Rarity, calm down.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.132
What's gotten into you?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.400
What's gotten
into you?

13:55.402 --> 13:58.436
Go ahead, see
your little show.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.305
Congratu-pony-lations,
fillies!

14:00.307 --> 14:02.006
Sounds like you've all
figured out already

14:02.008 --> 14:05.143
It's every pony for
herself in this town!

14:05.145 --> 14:07.545
<i>(door slams)</i>

14:08.314 --> 14:11.015
<i>(machines start back up)</i>

14:11.017 --> 14:17.188
â™ª

14:17.190 --> 14:20.291
There, that's the last of them.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.894
Finally.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.363
You're welcome.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.000
Let's have another round of
applause for suri polomare's

14:29.002 --> 14:31.069
Amazing collection.

14:31.071 --> 14:36.374
<i>(cheers)</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:39.611
That fabric! So original!

14:41.914 --> 14:42.881
<i>(sigh)</i>

14:42.883 --> 14:44.249
Well, look who's here.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.584
Going to show off your
copycat collection?

14:46.586 --> 14:47.318
<i>(little laugh)</i>

14:47.320 --> 14:52.323
And now, rarity from ponyville
with her brand new line...

14:52.325 --> 14:56.494
And I mean brand
new: Hotel chic.

14:56.496 --> 15:02.333
<i>â™ª (techno)</i>

15:02.335 --> 15:05.637
<i>(excited buzz)</i>

15:05.639 --> 15:15.980
â™ª

15:15.982 --> 15:17.315
They're liking it.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.217
I think I may have
just won this thing.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.619
Oh, I can't wait to
celebrate with...

15:25.190 --> 15:26.291
My friends.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.692
They didn't come.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.627
What have I done?

15:29.629 --> 15:33.097
<i>(shutters clicking)</i>

15:35.301 --> 15:38.303
<i>(cheers)</i>

15:38.305 --> 15:40.371
Rarity, they all adore you!

15:40.373 --> 15:44.309
Aren't you going to tell them
about your fabulous pieces?

15:44.311 --> 15:49.580
â™ª

15:49.582 --> 15:51.182
I have to go.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.151
Come back at once!

15:53.153 --> 15:55.420
This is unheard of!

15:58.390 --> 15:59.424
How do you do, ma'am?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.425
Contest going well?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.159
No time to talk.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.560
I have to find my friends.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.262
Oh. They're
gone already.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.331
I saw them headed
out this morning.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.498
Oh no!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.467
Back to ponyville, I imagine.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.303
Oh! They worked so
hard on my behalf

16:12.305 --> 16:15.073
And I repaid them
with unkindness.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.075
What have I done?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.743
Oh. Here you are.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.014
But miss, I
didn't do anything!

16:23.016 --> 16:27.151
<i>(thunder and rain)</i>

16:27.153 --> 16:34.158
<i>â™ª</i>

16:34.160 --> 16:37.762
<i>â™ª oh manehattan,</i>
<i>what have I done? â™ª</i>

16:37.764 --> 16:42.600
<i>â™ª the thought of</i>
<i>fashion week was fun â™ª</i>

16:42.602 --> 16:46.571
<i>â™ª but I went way too far.</i>

16:46.573 --> 16:54.645
<i>â™ª my friends gave to me</i>
<i>in ways so kind â™ª</i>

16:54.647 --> 17:02.086
<i>â™ª and I gave them nothing</i>
<i>but a hard time â™ª</i>

17:02.088 --> 17:10.528
<i>â™ª and now alone I stand</i>
<i>and now alone I stand. â™ª</i>

17:10.530 --> 17:13.064
<i>(song ends)</i>

17:16.168 --> 17:17.035
<i>(desk bell rings)</i>

17:17.037 --> 17:18.403
I need a moment
with prim hemline.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.537
I have to rush
back to ponyville

17:19.539 --> 17:21.339
But I just wanted to
thank her first for--

17:21.341 --> 17:24.542
Uh oh oh. You best steer
clear of prim for a while.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.678
She's pretty furious.
Isn't that right?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.747
Um...Yes.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.317
There you all are!

17:33.319 --> 17:35.820
I can't believe it! I
thought you went back home.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.556
We missed the show
because we overslept.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.760
Suri told us you lost;
we're really sorry.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.630
I lost?

17:45.632 --> 17:47.265
You know what? I
don't even care.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.735
I'm just happy you're all still
here after how I treated you.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.471
Taking advantage of your
friendship the way I did.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.174
<i>How could you</i>
<i>ever see past it?</i>

17:56.176 --> 17:58.643
Yeah, you were
pretty rotten.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.544
Wow, applejack.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.847
I know your thing is
honesty, but come on!

18:03.282 --> 18:06.417
Last night we may not have
seen you at your best,

18:06.419 --> 18:07.418
But we know you.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.487
And we would never let
one thing like that

18:09.489 --> 18:11.556
Change how we
feel about you.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.791
Oh! Thank you.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.461
You really are the most
wonderful friends

18:16.463 --> 18:18.529
A pony could have.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.866
You know, I already arranged
to make it up to you

18:21.868 --> 18:22.567
This afternoon.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.803
Hope you're all available
for an exclusive performance

18:25.805 --> 18:28.106
Of hinny of the hills.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.842
<i>(cheers)</i>

18:30.844 --> 18:33.478
And that is how it's done.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.747
Pretty clever how I convinced
her to stay away from prim,

18:36.749 --> 18:37.415
Wasn't it?

18:37.417 --> 18:41.786
Wouldn't have wanted her to find
out the truth, now would we?

18:44.123 --> 18:53.431
<i>â™ª and I'm a dancing pony!</i>

18:55.434 --> 19:00.638
<i>(cheers)</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:04.408
Wow, that was even
better than I imagined!

19:04.410 --> 19:06.511
I loved it!

19:09.414 --> 19:12.583
Uh, I mean, it was all right.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.152
<i>(giggle)</i>

19:14.154 --> 19:17.688
How did you ever get them to
agree to do an extra performance

19:17.690 --> 19:18.356
Just for us?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.658
Remember my costume designer
friend who got me the tickets?

19:20.660 --> 19:25.563
Well, I offered to make all
the costumes for his next show.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.432
Here in manehattan?

19:28.434 --> 19:30.401
Well, um... Yes.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.738
It will keep me away from
ponyville for a while...

19:33.740 --> 19:34.338
<i>(sigh)</i>

19:34.340 --> 19:35.740
But I so wanted
you to see this show!

19:35.742 --> 19:40.244
And working for this designer
is such a great opportunity.

19:40.246 --> 19:40.778
We know.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.713
We're happy for you, rarity.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.216
We're just sad for us.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.251
<i>Mind if I join you?</i>

19:48.787 --> 19:51.389
Sure. Come on down.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.729
This is the first place
trophy for fashion week.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.830
With my name on it.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.332
But I thought I lost!

20:01.334 --> 20:03.568
You didn't. You won.

20:03.802 --> 20:06.871
Suri was hoping that if you
didn't claim your prize,

20:06.873 --> 20:08.706
The judges would
consider it a forfeit

20:08.708 --> 20:10.541
And first place
would go to her.

20:10.543 --> 20:15.513
So she lied to make you and
your friends go away, and...

20:15.515 --> 20:17.782
Well, I lied, too.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.617
I've worked for
suri for so long,

20:19.619 --> 20:21.319
I started to believe
that it really is

20:21.321 --> 20:23.554
Every pony for
herself in this town.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.757
Until I saw how generous
you were with your friends.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.460
And how generous
they were with you.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.928
It made me start believing

20:30.930 --> 20:34.232
There was something
better for me out there.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.300
So I, I quit.

20:36.935 --> 20:40.471
I brought you something
to say thank you.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.777
I suppose you'll need a job now
that you're no longer with suri.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.513
How would you like to
work for my friend

20:49.515 --> 20:52.650
Making all the costumes
for his next show?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.555
Manehattan was simply grand.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.791
<i>It was in this magnificent</i>
<i>metropolis that I learned</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:03.794
<i>That while there are ponies</i>
<i>who will take advantage</i>

21:03.796 --> 21:04.629
<i>Of your generosity,</i>

21:04.631 --> 21:06.797
<i>You should never, ever</i>
<i>let that cause you</i>

21:06.799 --> 21:08.833
<i>To abandon your</i>
<i>generous spirit.</i>

21:08.835 --> 21:11.369
<i>Nothing feels worse</i>
