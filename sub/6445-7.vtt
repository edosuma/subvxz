WEBVTT

00:31.615 --> 00:33.025
Wait...

00:33.951 --> 00:36.112
...l have a surprise for you.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.777
I like surprises...

00:38.914 --> 00:40.870
...but I don't like to wait.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.210
It'll be worth it. Trust me.

01:16.994 --> 01:17.983
Shut up!

01:20.998 --> 01:22.158
Come on, get up!

01:25.335 --> 01:26.916
Give it to him!

01:29.798 --> 01:31.413
Come on.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.845
Yeah.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.272
-Come on.
-You want some of this?

01:49.193 --> 01:50.683
They don't.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.355
But I do.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.605
Oliver?

02:36.824 --> 02:41.989
Okay, I'm pretty open minded, but kinky
hide-and-seek really isn't my game.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.960
Okay, you win.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.748
Olly olly whatever-whatever.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.761
Okay, Oliver, this isn't funny.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.638
Where are you?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.980
Good one, Lois.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.858
Don't worry, oops will have a key.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.692
Surprise.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.025
Mom, I have a big appetite, but you've
got enough food here to feed an army.

04:47.204 --> 04:50.822
I thought it'd be a good idea to invite
a few people over for Thanksgiving.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.457
Actually, I was hoping
we could keep it low-key.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.539
I'm not feeling very thankful this year.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.456
It's going to be a hard day, especially
after what just happened to Raya...

05:00.634 --> 05:03.797
...but company could help.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.213
It was Dad's holiday.
He carved the turkey.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.052
I can carve this year.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.141
Mom, he was the one who made sure
we all said what we were thankful for.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.228
He always made sure
that I was thankful for my abilities...

05:19.403 --> 05:21.018
...but you know what? He was wrong.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.855
If I was normal,
he would still be here...

05:25.909 --> 05:28.742
...carving the turkey
with grandpa's old carving knife.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.667
Hey.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.501
So you can scratch Oliver's name
off the Thanksgiving guest list...

05:38.672 --> 05:41.880
...or any other guest list, for that matter.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.628
I'm solo.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.794
Well, that's too bad. What happened?

05:46.972 --> 05:50.681
Last night he pulled another one
of his trademark disappearing acts...

05:50.851 --> 05:52.387
...smack in the middle of a date.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.973
Well, I'm sorry, Lois.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.473
Oh, don't be. I mean, who's kidding
who here? We had no future.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.939
He's a world-renowned billionaire,
and I am a nail-biting...

06:03.113 --> 06:05.069
...Talon-dwelling, tabloid reporter.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.232
Lois, I'm sure you'll ﬁnd someone
who's better suited for you.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.992
Yeah, I know, I know, life goes on.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.159
At least for some people.
Have you heard the news?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.241
The Green Arrow was shot last night.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.202
It's in today's Planet.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.623
A man found him bleeding...

06:24.801 --> 06:27.292
...and ran for help.
When the cops ﬁnally got there...

06:27.471 --> 06:29.632
...all that was left was a bloodstain.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.890
Lex.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.103
I found the charitable organization
I want to focus on.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.272
It's Second Chance Halfway House.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.117
l have the time, and I heard you
mention them on the phone...

06:52.287 --> 06:54.653
...and then I found this brochure.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.537
What an amazing program.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.450
I don't see why
they can't be in every city in the country.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.708
Lana".

07:00.879 --> 07:04.838
...you'd be in contact with violent
criminals just released from prison.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.591
Maybe from time to time,
but mostly I'd be at the central ofﬁce.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.178
Why not channel your energy
into the Youth Foundation...

07:12.349 --> 07:14.055
...or the Center for Victim's Rights?

07:14.226 --> 07:16.638
Because this is what I want to do.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.303
I'm just trying to protect you.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.774
What is it with people feeling
like they have to protect me?

07:24.945 --> 07:28.108
Lex, I don't need to be watched over.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.398
I didn't say you did.
I want you to be safe.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.443
Well, this isn't about what you want.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.036
This is about what I want.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.160
Pick any other project.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.617
I'm
sorry

08:07.904 --> 08:10.156
You're looking awfully healthy.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.940
It's called exercise, Clark.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.326
Something mortals
have to do from time to time.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.032
According to The Daily Planet...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.583
...the Green Arrow was shot last night.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.742
If I was shot, don't you think
I'd be in a hospital or a morgue?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.956
I'm not bulletproof like you are, Clark.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.419
Besides, you should know better
than to believe everything...

08:29.593 --> 08:30.958
...you read in the newspaper.

08:31.136 --> 08:35.505
It's The Daily Planet, not the Inquisitor.
A witness saw you lying in a pool of blood.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.966
Maybe it was someone else
with a preference for green.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.316
What's your Green Arrow gear
doing in the middle of the room?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.187
I'm uploading a video.
Check this out.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.742
See that?

08:58.246 --> 09:01.329
Now I've got footage of the scumbags,
so if they try to get away...

09:01.499 --> 09:03.455
...I can track them down.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.117
Oliver, you're getting sloppy.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.879
Your gear's out in the room, the door's
unlocked. That could have been Lois.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.586
Yeah. You know what?
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.046
You were too busy using your powers
to bale hay...

09:14.221 --> 09:17.054
...than to realize
there's a crime wave in Metropolis.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.302
Let me ask you a question.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.806
Are you ever gonna get off your ass
and do something for a change?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.312
-I didn't come to be insulted.
-There's the door.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.067
-I don't remember you being invited.
-Oliver, what's going on with you?

09:30.862 --> 09:33.695
I don't need advice from someone
whose only worry in life...

09:33.865 --> 09:36.572
-...is to protect his identity.
-That's a lie, you know it.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.281
Let me tell you, when I'm on the streets,
I'm protecting people, all right?

09:40.455 --> 09:43.288
I got much bigger things
to worry about. Like staying alive.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.132
Are you okay?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.885
-l'm ﬁne, just get out of here. Go!
-You sure?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.970
Come in.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.979
When did you turn the apartment
into a ﬂorist shop?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.985
They're from Oliver.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.071
Wait a second.
The guy smothers you with ﬂowers...

10:59.242 --> 11:02.700
-...and you forget everything he's done?
-Please, I'm not that gullible.

11:02.871 --> 11:07.035
The whole botanical overkill
was just a lame attempt to beg forgiveness.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.247
Well, if he shows up in person to beg
for forgiveness, don't answer the door.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.412
Lois, I went to talk to him
at his apartment.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.882
You didn't. What were you thinking?

11:18.053 --> 11:21.762
-l was looking out for you.
-I have 20/20 vision. I look out for myself.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.719
When I was in his apartment,
I found a needle and a syringe.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.432
Unless they're doctor-prescribed,
I think Oliver's doing drugs.

11:30.732 --> 11:35.476
This actually explains a lot.
All those times he disappeared.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.728
I should have known.

11:38.907 --> 11:43.401
He said that Thanksgiving was a hard time
of year, made him think about his parents.

11:43.578 --> 11:46.570
Lois, I think you might wanna
keep your distance.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.999
He has a substance abuse problem,
not leprosy.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.785
I'm not going to abandon him
when he needs me the most.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.215
He's not himself now.
Based on his behavior...

11:56.383 --> 11:58.965
...I don't think
he's someone you wanna be around.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.797
Well, see, that's the difference
between you and me, Clark.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.633
I don't desert people
when they need help.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.184
-You're a miracle worker, doc.
-We need to talk, Mr. Queen.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.187
We certainly do.

12:16.361 --> 12:20.149
I ﬁnally found myself injured
badly enough to use the RL65...

12:20.323 --> 12:22.780
...and it works perfectly.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.988
Not just once. I cut my hand,
and after one injection...

12:26.162 --> 12:27.447
...l was completely healed.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.250
Well, don't take any more.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.125
Last time I checked, doctor,
you worked for me.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.332
The lab mice have been exhibiting
irrational cognitive behavior...

12:37.507 --> 12:41.546
-...and more troubling, violent tendencies.
-l'm not a mouse, I feel ﬁne.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.134
Do you? No lapses in judgment?
No sudden outbursts of anger?

12:48.059 --> 12:51.301
Not really, but I am starting
to feel one coming on right now.

12:51.479 --> 12:55.222
It's not worth risking possible psychosis
just so you can climb Mount Everest...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.186
...or parachute out of your Learjet.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.523
This isn't about
my recreational activities, doctor.

13:00.697 --> 13:04.986
We're on the verge of a medical
breakthrough that can save countless lives.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.360
I'm more than honored
to be the guinea pig.

13:15.128 --> 13:19.337
Trust me, I can handle
the occasional temper tantrum.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.589
Okay, well,
I'll talk to you after the break, senator.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.886
You have a happy Thanksgiving too.
Bye-bye.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.520
Come on in.
I was just about to call you.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.110
I didn't get your R.S.V.P.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.525
Well, that is why I'm here.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.955
...came in person to tell you that...

13:55.126 --> 13:57.082
...I won't be coming for...

13:58.588 --> 13:59.748
...Thanksgiving dinner.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.586
Well, that's too bad.
I was really looking forward to seeing you.

14:05.136 --> 14:10.301
After Lillian died, I somehow decided that
I would stop celebrating Thanksgiving.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.966
Why don't you make an exception
and celebrate with us?

14:13.144 --> 14:14.600
We'd really love to have you.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.727
I don't think Clark would agree.

14:19.901 --> 14:26.113
The holiday's going to be difﬁcult this
year, without extra complications for him.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.240
You're not a complication, Lionel.

14:30.370 --> 14:36.081
You're a part of my life now,
and I'm very thankful for that.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.290
Do you know what that means to me?

14:44.175 --> 14:45.790
Do you know what you mean to me?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.769
Martha, l....

15:03.194 --> 15:05.310
I didn't mean to....

15:05.488 --> 15:07.820
I'm
sorry

15:08.741 --> 15:10.652
I'm so sorry.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.371
-I take it this wasn't a party favor.
-I broke into his apartment.

15:24.549 --> 15:28.292
-There might be some residue still left.
-I call Oliver Queen a lot of things...

15:28.469 --> 15:31.961
-...I never thought I'd call him a junkie.
-I don't think he's getting high.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.883
Come on, Clark. You of all people should
know that everyone has their secrets.

15:36.060 --> 15:40.724
It's not a stretch to think that a jet-setting
billionaire might have a habit to hide.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.435
Can you just get it checked out?
We'll know for sure.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.192
I'll text my bio-chem buddy at Met U.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.478
Hopefully he hasn't left for Thanksgiving.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.568
That Green Arrow story.
That victim actually see him get shot?

15:51.743 --> 15:55.156
No, but the people that owned the car
did come fonlvard...

15:55.330 --> 15:57.491
...and say that he saved them that night.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.906
He hasn't been spotted since.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.748
-l'm gonna get this syringe to my chemist.
-Great.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.631
Why don't you head out, and I will get
a hold of you as soon as I ﬁnd anything.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.510
-Are you trying to get rid of me?
-No, why would I wanna do that?

16:18.436 --> 16:21.178
-Lana.
-Hi.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.557
Us girls were just gonna get some lunch.

16:25.735 --> 16:29.068
That's great. Have a good time.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.446
Well, that wasn't awkward at all.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.488
I try to keep the heavenly bodies from
colliding, but there's only so much I can do.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.531
I want you to check
something out for me.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.701
Yeah, okay. My Google is your Google.
What do you need?

16:44.879 --> 16:48.087
I'm curious about this halfway house
that LuthorCorp supports.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.795
I offered to get involved,
but Lex won't let me. He says it isn't safe.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.257
Well, most halfway houses
aren't exactly amusement parks, Lana.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.717
I don't think that's it.

16:58.142 --> 17:02.476
Lex swears that he's honest with me,
but lately he's been a little secretive.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.806
I don't know, maybe I'm reading into it.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.272
No, I think you're just being cautious,
which is smart.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.937
Don't worry, we'll ﬁgure things out.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.739
Are you all right?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.320
Lana. Lana.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.741
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

17:24.919 --> 17:27.456
From where l was sitting,
it looked like you fainted.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.586
-Let's get you to a doctor.
-No, it's okay.

17:29.966 --> 17:33.834
Can we keep my little siesta between us?
I really wouldn't want anyone to worry.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.171
Well, it's a little late for that,
but, yeah, okay.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.239
Surprise.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.704
-I didn't--
-Get away from me.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.369
I swear to God,
I'll rip your green head off.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.046
I'm calling the cops.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.212
See? 911.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.234
-Hello?
-91 1.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.110
I need an ambulance.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.150
Hurry.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.070
Have you ever fainted before?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.830
Three times. All in the last month.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.079
These headaches you've been having,...

19:31.254 --> 19:33.495
...would you describe the pain
as sharp, or dull?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.461
And it's getting worse.

19:38.636 --> 19:42.879
I've tried all of the over-the-counter
pain relievers, but none of them work.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.552
They're just migraines, right?

19:47.311 --> 19:50.144
Just a few more tests,
we'll have a clearer picture.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.319
Martha, I'm so glad you came here.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.867
Haven't been able to stop thinking...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.369
...about what happened.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.251
I wanted to apologize for—

20:14.422 --> 20:16.629
I didn't come here for an apology, Lionel.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.209
-You did nothing wrong.
-I did.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.961
-I had no right to presume that I could--
-No, look...

20:23.890 --> 20:26.256
...there's something between us.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.802
What it is, I don't think
either of us knows...

20:30.980 --> 20:35.144
...but I do know
I'm not ready to ﬁnd out.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.899
Not yet.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.029
-I understand.
-I don't think you do understand.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.863
I value our relationship.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.291
Well, then, of course. I will be there.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.174
Lois...

21:06.349 --> 21:08.510
-...what happened?
-Well...

21:08.684 --> 21:10.845
...lucky for me,
I walked in on Green Arrow...

21:11.020 --> 21:13.682
...pulling a reverse Santa Claus
on Oliver's apartment.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.141
The Green Arrow did this?

21:15.316 --> 21:19.025
Guess it was only a matter of time
before he hit up the new billionaire in town.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.983
Luckily, I was able to get in
a few solid licks of my own.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.318
He'll be nursing
a couple broken ribs for sure.

21:25.493 --> 21:29.361
Have you talked to Oliver yet?
Has he visited you here in the hospital?

21:30.373 --> 21:31.783
No.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.542
I tried him on all his numbers,
and he was nowhere to be found.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.708
Clark, I'm nervous.

21:39.882 --> 21:43.591
Either he's on some kind of crazy drug
bender, or Green Arrow has gotten to him.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.126
Lois, don't worry.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.046
I promise I'll do everything I can
to track him down.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.636
Yeah, that'll be a big help.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.222
Look, I'll just call Chloe.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.031
I'll take that.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.569
-I put a bullet in your chest.
-And now you're gonna pay for it.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.873
I don't think so.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.601
Hey, buddy.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.767
-How did you survive that fall?
-Yoga. Now let go of me.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.026
You tell me how, or I'm calling the cops.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.572
You'll call the cops anyway.

22:45.740 --> 22:49.483
You may be able to heal,
but that doesn't mean you don't feel pain.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.111
-Let go.
-You start talking.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.780
There's this doctor
who comes to the halfway house.

22:55.958 --> 23:00.452
We get these shots they say are vitamins.
That's some kind of vitamin, huh?

23:00.629 --> 23:01.880
What's the doctor's name?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.710
-How am I supposed to know?
-What does he look like?

23:05.634 --> 23:08.091
It's not a he. She's a chick.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.392
Waste not, want not.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.810
What happened, doctor, bad batch?

23:27.948 --> 23:29.984
The project's shut down.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.321
Look, I might have come into this game
a little late...

23:33.496 --> 23:35.657
...but I'm paying you a lot more
than Queen.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.665
-He isn't shutting down anything.
-You're right. I am.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.451
And I could careless
about your petty rivalry.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.372
This has gone beyond
one-upmanship, doctor.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.927
Your research is now
a personal cause of mine.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.587
Find another cause. I won't
be responsible for any more violence.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.302
Should have thought about that
when you took my money.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.138
I admit, I was blinded by greed...

23:58.312 --> 24:01.975
...but now that people are getting hurt,
money means nothing to me.

24:02.149 --> 24:06.688
I'm going back to the drawing board.
All existing RL65 is being destroyed.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.690
I'm sorry, doctor, I can't let you do that.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.790
Hey, how's Lois?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.202
Physically, she's ﬁne.
She's looking for Oliver.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.712
-I can't ﬁnd him anywhere.
-Maybe this will help.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.920
My geek analyzed the liquid
in that syringe, and you're right.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.960
No one's gonna take it and go to a rave.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.471
It's a cutting edge molecular modiﬁer...

24:35.641 --> 24:37.848
...that has to do
with tissue regeneration.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.974
So it has some sort of healing power.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.479
Conceivably, but according to my Einstein,
it also packs a mean punch...

24:43.649 --> 24:47.892
...to a part of your brain, the amygdala,
which triggers violent behavior.

24:48.070 --> 24:51.688
Now, why in God's name would Oliver
be injecting something like that?

24:51.866 --> 24:55.859
I don't know, but we better ﬁnd him
before he does something he regrets.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.162
Who created the drug?

25:01.917 --> 25:05.785
A woman named Pamela Black
is the only one doing that level of research.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.421
She's a professor at Princeton,
and has been taking a recent sabbatical...

25:09.592 --> 25:11.378
...to work with Queen Industries.

25:11.552 --> 25:15.591
If she's supplying drugs, then most likely
Oliver's gonna show up for more.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.490
She's dead.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.705
And her place
has been completely pillaged.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.168
Drugs or no drugs,
I can't believe Oliver would kill someone.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.003
I don't think it was Oliver, Clark.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.463
It was the Green Arrow.

25:57.056 --> 26:01.925
Looks like our green hero has made the leap
from Robin Hood to cold-blooded killer.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.060
I just don't understand
why a scientist was his target.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.098
-Chloe.
-C|ark!

26:13.906 --> 26:15.817
These folders are from a halfway house...

26:15.991 --> 26:18.573
...in Metropolis called Second Chance.
This doctor...

26:18.744 --> 26:21.907
...she was giving the kids
the same drugs Oliver was taking.

26:22.873 --> 26:25.580
Lex's foundation
funds this halfway house.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.039
Lex co-opted Oliver's scientist.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.625
Those two have been at each other
since high school.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.758
And the Green Arrow got in the way.
Ever the crusader for the underprivileged...

26:35.928 --> 26:38.510
...he must've gotten wind
of Dr. Black's experiments...

26:38.681 --> 26:40.387
...and taken care of her his own way.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.390
It Green Arrow found out
that LuthorCorp is behind this...

26:43.560 --> 26:45.551
...Lex could be the next target.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.365
Sorry.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.584
I'm looking for Lex.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.215
He's not here.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.637
You okay?

27:27.187 --> 27:29.018
Lana, what is it?

27:30.899 --> 27:33.185
It's nothing. I'm ﬁne.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.279
You don't look ﬁne.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.618
You can talk to me, it's okay.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.827
It is.

27:51.545 --> 27:55.333
Do you ever wish
that you could go back in time...

27:56.175 --> 27:58.587
...and everything would be different?

28:03.932 --> 28:05.797
All the time.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.770
What happened? What did--

28:21.075 --> 28:23.987
-What did Lex do?
-He didn't do anything.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.328
If you're in trouble, Lana, I can help.

28:28.499 --> 28:31.366
Clark, this has nothing to do with you.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.789
Could you please just go?

29:05.828 --> 29:07.864
Your car is ready, sir.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.334
Sorry, Luthor.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.340
Work's not over yet.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.671
-What is this?
-Sign on the dotted line...

29:27.850 --> 29:31.809
...and all your assets will be divided
among the 50 global charities listed below.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.937
Would you mind telling me
what I've done to deserve this?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.769
After your support of the
Second Chance Halfway House...

29:37.943 --> 29:42.152
...I think it's a natural step.
I went by to check out the facility.

29:42.322 --> 29:46.190
After some prodding, the director told me
what you were doing to the residents.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.574
He was lying.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.986
So then I went to pay
the good doctor a visit, and guess what?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.159
She's dead.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.999
I knew you weren't a saint, Luthor,
but killing a woman to cover your tracks?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.041
You're delusional.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.458
Sign it.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.221
What the hell are you doing?

30:15.856 --> 30:17.562
It's out of ink.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.893
Drop it.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.021
-You ﬁrst.
-What do you think is faster?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.737
An arrow, or a bullet?

30:30.746 --> 30:32.577
There's only one way to ﬁnd out.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.890
Oliver.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.900
What have you done?

31:08.075 --> 31:10.942
He pulled a gun, Clark. I had no choice.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.077
Lex? Lex?

31:14.248 --> 31:16.113
No, let nature take its course.

31:18.126 --> 31:21.493
Oliver, that's the drugs talking.
It's not you.

31:21.672 --> 31:25.130
Hey, that drug is the best thing
that ever happened to me, Clark.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.792
I'm not bulletproof like you are.
I gotta do whatever it takes.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.929
-I need that drug.
-Oliver, you're not a killer.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.464
No, but he is, Clark.

31:33.642 --> 31:37.430
Listen to me, you and I both know the
world's a better place without Lex Luthor.

31:40.691 --> 31:45.185
That's not for us to decide, Oliver.
Where are the drugs?

31:45.362 --> 31:48.149
Lex, he took it all.
He took it all from the lab.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.163
Let him die.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.474
You killed him.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.320
You killed him.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.468
Who am I dealing with? Jekyll or Hyde?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.431
Just plain old Oliver today, Clark.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.476
You haven't broken any glasses.
That's a good sign.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.016
Right.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.442
What made you come to your senses?

33:53.949 --> 33:55.735
Actually, you did.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.536
This whole time, I just wanted to be
like Clark Kent, you know. I wanted to--

34:02.958 --> 34:05.449
I wanted the ability
to bring justice to the world...

34:05.627 --> 34:08.539
...without having to worry
about getting killed in the process.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.458
And then something occurred to me,
and I realized...

34:15.011 --> 34:17.593
...that Clark Kent would never take
another man's life.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.973
I came within an inch of doing just that.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.646
I'm not even in your league.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.359
Oliver, you do a lot of good in this world.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.193
You don't need to be indestructible
to be a hero.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.821
Yeah. No, you're right, you're right.
Yeah--

34:40.996 --> 34:45.114
I should be thankful for who I am, right?
And the abilities that I have. I know that.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.454
Me too.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.873
Now, come on,
you can't be alone on Thanksgiving.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.552
The bird's waiting.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.429
Thanks, Clark, l--
No, I appreciate the offer, but I can't.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.760
Lois is gonna be there...

35:02.934 --> 35:06.301
...and I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to be in the same zip code as me.

35:06.480 --> 35:11.691
Now that you're back on track,
I'm sure Lois is gonna want you there.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.851
-Trust me.
-Whoa, trust you?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.980
What happened to lectures
about guys with secret identities...

35:18.158 --> 35:19.864
...not able to handle relationships?

35:22.037 --> 35:27.077
The truth is, you and I are different,
and Lois isn't Lana.

35:28.210 --> 35:31.543
If you two are meant to be together,
then who am I to stand in the way?

35:49.064 --> 35:51.806
Hey. Are you feeling any better?

35:51.983 --> 35:54.065
Hanging in there.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.315
Well, make yourself comfortable.
I did my due diligence...

35:57.489 --> 35:59.901
...on the Second Chances
Halfway House, and I found--

36:00.075 --> 36:04.239
Chloe, I'm not here to talk about
the halfway house.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.367
Okay.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.909
But there's some stuff I think you
should know about, Lana. About Lex.

36:12.087 --> 36:16.251
I don't want to hear anything more
about Lex. I can't.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.424
What's going on?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.131
Lana, what happened?

36:23.682 --> 36:27.220
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.805
Chloe...

36:35.735 --> 36:37.145
...l'm pregnant.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.948
Okay.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.877
There.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.137
Did you cook that on the barbecue?

37:06.308 --> 37:09.971
It's a little crispy on the outside,
but it's what's on the inside that counts.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.555
I'm sure it's delicious.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.472
Clark, would you put the hot plate
on the table, please?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.974
Did you talk to Oliver today?

37:17.861 --> 37:19.647
Don't go there, Smallville.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.940
I think that's for you.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.284
Jimmy says hi from his mom's house
and, ever the reporter, he has news.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.498
I guess the Metropolis P.D. arrested...

37:37.672 --> 37:40.004
...Pamela Black's killer,
and you were right.

37:40.175 --> 37:44.214
It wasn't the Green Arrow.
It was some kid from the halfway house.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.094
I'd bet anything
that Lexis somehow behind this.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.881
Maybe. I doubt
we'll be able to prove it, though.

37:50.060 --> 37:53.302
I guarantee you Lex's shredders
are doing some serious overtime.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.186
Does Lana know about this?

37:56.024 --> 37:59.357
I went by the mansion the other day,
and she was upset about something.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.108
Is she all right?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.522
Yeah. Yeah, as far as I know.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.899
She's ﬁne.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.457
Oliver.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.828
Happy turkey day.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.549
Where you been?
I've been worried about you.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.554
Yeah.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.717
Listen, that's all over now.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.143
I'm like a walking drug-free zone. Honest.

38:40.402 --> 38:43.986
If I were to hug you right now, I wouldn't
stab myself on any stray needles?

38:46.074 --> 38:47.689
Get over here.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.534
I'm so sorry I ever hurt you.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.764
Ifl could have
everyone's attention, please?

39:16.938 --> 39:19.099
I'd like to make a little announcement.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.937
Our family has a tradition...

39:25.113 --> 39:28.605
...that goes back
way before I was even born...

39:29.451 --> 39:33.945
...where everyone takes a moment to say
what they're most thankful for in their lives.

39:40.128 --> 39:44.963
I would just like to say that
I'm most thankful for my mom and dad...

39:50.930 --> 39:54.263
...whose faith in me
taught me to have faith in myself.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.894
Thank you.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.029
-Hear, hear.
-Let's eat.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.428
You haven't said a word all night.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.472
Is everything okay?

41:19.602 --> 41:21.467
Everything's ﬁne.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.309
Happy Thanksgiving.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.956
