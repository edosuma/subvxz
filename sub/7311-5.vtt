WEBVTT

00:18.520 --> 00:19.521
Crap!

00:30.790 --> 00:31.790
Rob?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.629
It's Liz, from next door.

00:44.122 --> 00:45.122
Hello?

00:46.465 --> 00:47.465
Rob?

01:27.435 --> 01:30.733
NCIS Season 6 Episode 5
Nine Lives Versio LOL 0.85.

01:32.565 --> 01:34.028
Synchro: OAkaZabo.

01:36.277 --> 01:37.865
Thanks to Bruno!

02:03.769 --> 02:06.534
I don't speak Hebrew, but
I'm pretty sure you just swore.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.014
What happened? Your Men of Mossad
calendar get lost in the mail?

02:11.032 --> 02:13.087
Women of Mossad calendar
get lost in the mail?

02:13.157 --> 02:16.420
If you must know, it was
an airline reservation that got lost.

02:16.752 --> 02:18.109
So going to Israel?

02:18.247 --> 02:20.659
Not if I can not get
a seat on the flight I want.

02:26.068 --> 02:27.721
- What?
- Is it a what...

02:28.675 --> 02:29.850
or a who?

02:32.713 --> 02:35.527
Now you're speaking in a language
that I do not understand.

02:35.696 --> 02:37.304
Weren't you just in Israel?

02:37.364 --> 02:38.364
So?

02:44.166 --> 02:45.972
What is it that is bothering you

02:46.032 --> 02:47.059
so much, Tony?

02:47.245 --> 02:49.734
- Do I look troubled?
- As a matter of fact...

02:49.921 --> 02:52.545
Are you getting so hot
and bothersome because...

02:53.247 --> 02:55.409
you think I may be having
a little fun?

02:56.565 --> 02:57.565
Yeah. Gibbs.

02:58.959 --> 03:00.937
As you know,
people go on vacations all the time.

03:00.997 --> 03:03.597
- Normal people.
- I am normal people.

03:03.694 --> 03:06.938
You're normal people like the people
from Ordinary People are normal people.

03:06.998 --> 03:08.038
Grab your gear.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.061
Dead Marine.

03:11.061 --> 03:13.768
Well, DiNozzo,
she got the bothersome part right.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.264
Oh, my...

03:27.176 --> 03:28.434
She's not evidence, Tony.

03:28.495 --> 03:30.624
Just capturing
the scene of the crime, probie.

03:30.745 --> 03:32.495
Poor girl does seem very upset.

03:35.843 --> 03:36.896
Catch or cut?

03:45.432 --> 03:46.675
Go ahead. Cut it.

03:48.109 --> 03:49.851
Glad the poor girl's not my neighbor.

03:49.973 --> 03:51.951
Just walking in, helping herself.

03:52.229 --> 03:54.930
That's because you're a woman,
who's on her way to Tel Aviv.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.362
If you were a man...

03:57.147 --> 04:00.839
Well, let's just say I can understand
why the Lance Corporal was so...

04:01.276 --> 04:03.511
generous with his... tools.

04:04.922 --> 04:06.317
Background, DiNozzo?

04:06.659 --> 04:09.423
Liz Adler. 28 years old,
recently divorced...

04:09.483 --> 04:10.483
The victim.

04:11.688 --> 04:12.688
Sorry, I've...

04:13.200 --> 04:15.462
That's Lance Corporal Rob Brewer.
I thought you meant...

04:15.522 --> 04:18.334
Stationed at Quantico,
scheduled to go to Iraq in a few days,

04:18.399 --> 04:20.589
has already served two tours there.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.759
Lived alone.
According to Liz, the...

04:24.801 --> 04:26.059
Next-door neighbor,

04:26.366 --> 04:28.290
said that the house
belonged to his parents,

04:28.350 --> 04:29.744
and Brewer moved in a year ago.

04:29.804 --> 04:31.582
Nothing apparently
missing from the house.

04:31.642 --> 04:32.972
No evidence of a break-in.

04:33.032 --> 04:35.441
Safe to say he died of exsanguination.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.566
- Bled to death.
- Four to six hours ago.

04:39.730 --> 04:43.711
Somebody wanted
to make this poor fellow suffer.

04:44.519 --> 04:45.519
Or talk.

04:47.903 --> 04:49.810
Never seen anything like it before.

04:50.742 --> 04:51.742
Rope?

04:51.992 --> 04:52.992
Not the rope.

04:53.488 --> 04:54.790
It's what's on the rope.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.599
The mold, Gibbs.

04:56.881 --> 04:59.176
The mold is fascinating.

04:59.353 --> 05:02.078
Did you know there's over
100,000 species of mold,

05:02.212 --> 05:05.288
which is why it's not very surprising
that I haven't matched it yet.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.322
See these little conidiophores?

05:07.844 --> 05:10.941
That means that the mold is
in the sexual phase of reproduction.

05:11.385 --> 05:12.530
In a few days,

05:12.590 --> 05:15.961
these little appendages will sprout out
from the center, and then...

05:17.188 --> 05:20.686
well, then, we all know
what happens next.

05:20.956 --> 05:22.804
Are you enjoying yourself, Abs?

05:24.884 --> 05:25.884
Yes...

05:29.119 --> 05:30.505
But you're not. Sorry.

05:31.877 --> 05:34.071
I did better with the fingerprints.

05:34.146 --> 05:35.869
Most of them were Brewer's.

05:35.995 --> 05:38.880
The bloody ones were from the next-door
neighbor that found the body.

05:39.103 --> 05:41.550
But on the toolbox, mother lode.

05:41.847 --> 05:44.637
Fingerprints belonging
to Brewer's old squad leader,

05:44.697 --> 05:47.385
retired Marine Sergeant Jack Kale.

05:47.924 --> 05:50.096
Guess how long he's been retired?
That's right:

05:50.395 --> 05:52.289
Three weeks.
Guess why he retired.

05:53.919 --> 05:55.260
Not in a guessing mood.

05:55.650 --> 05:58.138
Okay. When he got back from
his last tour of duty?

05:58.292 --> 06:01.822
Sergeant Kale was diagnosed
with hypereosinophilic syndrome,

06:02.061 --> 06:04.819
or HES.
It's a blood disease, Gibbs.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.114
That's why he retired
from the Marine Corps.

06:07.174 --> 06:09.405
He had a bad reaction
to the medication,

06:09.601 --> 06:12.932
and he got psychotic and aggressive.
I sent the info to McGee.

06:14.705 --> 06:15.770
Thanks, Abs.

06:17.308 --> 06:18.884
You can go back to your mold now.

06:21.472 --> 06:23.020
You say the sweetest things.

06:23.276 --> 06:24.276
Mepolizumab.

06:24.831 --> 06:26.602
Yep.
It's spelled like it sounds.

06:28.162 --> 06:29.761
Can you check the other store?

06:30.283 --> 06:31.941
Spoke with Kale's company commander.

06:32.001 --> 06:35.318
Says Kale had a reputation as volatile,
tough on his men.

06:35.501 --> 06:37.672
- Probably even tougher on his meds.
- Where is he?

06:37.732 --> 06:40.362
That's a good question, boss.
He booked himself into the Freemont Inn

06:40.386 --> 06:42.697
near the base three weeks ago,
right after he was discharged.

06:42.721 --> 06:44.575
He stayed there six days
and then he's gone.

06:44.644 --> 06:46.603
- Credit cards?
- Hasn't used them since.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.930
No forwarding address,
no calls from his cell.

06:48.996 --> 06:51.108
Got some, boss. Kale's illness.

06:52.805 --> 06:55.250
Well, I don't have Kale's illness,
but Kale does,

06:55.310 --> 06:59.162
and he is taking a trial medication to
get rid of it, it's called mepolizumab.

06:59.249 --> 07:01.922
It's classified as an orphan drug,
which is an FDA distinction.

07:01.982 --> 07:04.521
It's basically created
to encourage the development...

07:06.412 --> 07:08.438
Point is it's new.
There's only three people in

07:08.498 --> 07:10.960
- the DC area taking part in the trial.
- Manufacturer.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.853
Manufacturer ships it directly
to the users each week.

07:13.913 --> 07:15.671
Just sent me a patient list.

07:16.137 --> 07:17.805
And look at that, here it is.

07:17.865 --> 07:20.350
Jack Kale. 2388 Montague.

07:21.506 --> 07:22.730
DiNozzo, you're with me.

07:26.262 --> 07:27.493
On your six, boss.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.878
No car.

07:43.126 --> 07:44.940
Probably out on his daily torture run.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.858
Two men, one armed.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.042
NCIS! Freeze!

08:04.174 --> 08:05.391
Easy, easy.

08:16.988 --> 08:18.390
What the hell are you doing?

08:27.203 --> 08:29.747
- There you go.
- There's gonna be payback.

08:29.909 --> 08:30.909
Sure.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.063
You lost a fight with a door.

08:33.794 --> 08:35.674
I wouldn't try to get back at Gibbs.

08:36.014 --> 08:37.465
Don't forget to ice that.

08:41.294 --> 08:42.294
Because...

08:42.510 --> 08:46.245
he's a key witness, the key witness
in a murder trial starts tomorrow.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.184
- Still got to talk to him.
- Why?

08:48.495 --> 08:50.284
Marine from his unit was murdered.

08:50.813 --> 08:53.327
- Kale a suspect?
- I'll know after I talk to him.

08:53.855 --> 08:55.651
- When'd it happen?
- Early this morning.

08:55.731 --> 08:58.904
You got wrong guy. Kale been locked up
with us for two weeks, couldn't done it.

08:59.083 --> 09:02.066
Then it won't hurt to ask why
his prints were at the crime scene.

09:02.725 --> 09:05.829
Defense lawyers find out Kale's being
investigated, he'll be discredited.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.546
Marine was tortured, Tobias.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.062
Kale might be able
to help us find out who did it.

09:10.797 --> 09:11.958
Nothing official.

09:12.289 --> 09:13.473
No tapes, no notes.

09:13.533 --> 09:16.055
And it happens right here,
right now, in front of me.

09:34.679 --> 09:37.322
Tough on a Marine?
Being cooped up like this.

09:41.167 --> 09:42.167
Yes, sir.

09:44.613 --> 09:46.839
I've already told
Agent Fornell everything.

09:48.270 --> 09:49.663
What do you want to know?

09:51.789 --> 09:54.802
How your fingerprints got
on Lance Corporal Brewer's toolbox.

09:56.848 --> 09:57.885
My toolbox.

09:59.118 --> 10:00.132
He's my friend.

10:01.084 --> 10:02.332
I let him borrow it.

10:03.111 --> 10:04.397
Why? What's going on?

10:05.202 --> 10:06.722
Brewer's dead, murdered.

10:09.412 --> 10:10.412
No.

10:12.054 --> 10:13.104
Can't be.

10:13.775 --> 10:16.678
Those tools, your tools,
used to torture him.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.476
- Who?
- You tell me.

10:32.034 --> 10:33.686
I have... I have no idea.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.357
All right, Agent Gibbs.

10:39.015 --> 10:40.137
Interview's over.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.961
What interview, Tobias?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.440
Hey,
good luck with your investigation.

10:47.491 --> 10:49.869
Who are you prosecuting anyway?
You never said.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.307
No. No, I didn't.

11:03.346 --> 11:06.857
When we get back, want you to find out
about the case Fornell's working on?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.247
Think he's hiding something?

11:11.223 --> 11:12.564
I think they both are.

11:15.143 --> 11:17.310
FBI sure has their finger
in a lot of pies.

11:17.652 --> 11:20.887
Terrorism, drugs, organized crime...

11:21.397 --> 11:23.257
Alec, what are

11:23.317 --> 11:25.326
crimes that land people in jail?

11:25.589 --> 11:28.219
No, the question is:
What are cases in court tomorrow

11:28.383 --> 11:31.317
involving an FBI agent
by the name of Tobias Fornell?

11:32.386 --> 11:33.642
What is...

11:34.869 --> 11:37.804
US v. Captain Melville's
Fish and Tackle?

11:37.977 --> 11:39.043
You are right.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.629
The FBI does have many fingers
in many pies.

11:41.789 --> 11:42.922
Captain Melville.

11:43.373 --> 11:44.403
Wait a second.

11:44.972 --> 11:45.972
Moby Dick.

11:46.526 --> 11:48.256
Sounds fishy,
it's got to be a pseudonym.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.310
Pseudonym? Explain.

11:50.527 --> 11:53.024
Sometimes the FBI will use a phony
name on a case if they're trying

11:53.048 --> 11:55.247
to hide the identities of people
they're prosecuting.

11:55.401 --> 11:57.005
And Fornell gave us nothing?

11:57.123 --> 11:58.699
Well, wasn't in a giving mood.

11:58.765 --> 12:01.011
Though he was generous enough
to give Kale an alibi.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.883
You think Fornell would lie to Gibbs?

12:03.422 --> 12:04.681
If he felt he must.

12:04.748 --> 12:08.051
Says the woman's being evasive to her
friends about her "vacation" to Israel.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.500
I am intrigued by how intrigued
you are by this, Tony.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.883
And I am curious that you are curious
that I am intrigued. What's his name?

12:14.393 --> 12:17.084
I do not believe I said
I was actually seeing anyone.

12:17.165 --> 12:20.245
Although it would be very difficult to
go to Israel and not see anyone at all.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.837
- It is quite populated, you know.
- That's cute.

12:22.938 --> 12:25.301
I don't see why you're having
trouble admitting this. You know

12:25.325 --> 12:27.955
you were in Israel for four months.
Plenty time to hook up with someone.

12:27.979 --> 12:30.954
In that amount of time, Tony would've
hooked up with several someones.

12:31.014 --> 12:33.390
- What is it you really want to know?
- Depends, Ziva.

12:33.450 --> 12:34.150
On?

12:34.451 --> 12:36.586
On...
what it is you don't want me to know.

12:36.850 --> 12:40.675
Sorry to interrupt you guys, but I
just got into the FBI's true name file.

12:40.735 --> 12:43.939
And look who is listed with
Captain Melville's Fish & Tackle.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.986
- None other than Rick Azari.
- Fornell's big fish.

12:47.170 --> 12:50.203
No wonder he's keeping
his cards so close to his breasts.

12:55.266 --> 12:59.128
Torture as a device to bring about
a confession has been around since,

12:59.566 --> 13:01.729
well, before the Middle Ages.

13:01.909 --> 13:05.849
Back then it was considered a necessary
part of the judicial process.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.492
Maybe that's how lawyers
started to get a bad reputation.

13:08.873 --> 13:09.873
Perhaps.

13:09.933 --> 13:13.102
But it's a nasty business,
especially for the lower classes.

13:13.608 --> 13:14.743
A commoner

13:14.824 --> 13:16.619
for example, was considered

13:16.700 --> 13:19.331
constitutionally
incapable of honesty in court

13:19.877 --> 13:22.515
unless he or she were tortured.

13:22.575 --> 13:25.562
Doesn't seem like a very reliable
method for getting at the truth.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.480
Quite right, but, as you can see,

13:27.723 --> 13:30.217
the process persists to this day.

13:30.987 --> 13:33.122
I had a very funny brush

13:33.182 --> 13:35.396
with torture once in Edinburgh.

13:35.679 --> 13:37.641
I performed an autopsy on a fellow

13:37.779 --> 13:39.935
whose torturer had taken his entrails,

13:40.036 --> 13:42.711
mixed them with oatmeal,
and made himself a haggis.

13:43.769 --> 13:44.794
You done?

13:45.862 --> 13:47.410
Yeah, well, I...

13:48.053 --> 13:49.213
I now know

13:49.781 --> 13:53.044
how Lance Corporal Brewer
spent his last hour.

13:53.342 --> 13:56.395
Ragged cuts to his hands

13:57.188 --> 13:58.608
and forearms.

13:58.812 --> 14:00.956
Probably using this half-inch chisel.

14:02.171 --> 14:03.210
Defensive wounds.

14:04.226 --> 14:06.079
He fought hard to get away.

14:06.229 --> 14:08.696
Notice, however,
the pattern of these cuts.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.876
Precise. Methodical.

14:11.069 --> 14:14.470
The slashing designed to inflict
the maximum pain, but not death.

14:14.779 --> 14:18.390
At first, I thought it was
the X-Acto knife.

14:19.261 --> 14:20.339
I know now...

14:21.106 --> 14:23.100
it was the trusty box cutter.

14:23.715 --> 14:25.584
Poor lad passed out at some point.

14:26.014 --> 14:28.070
I swabbed his nasal passages.

14:28.453 --> 14:31.382
Abby confirmed the presence
of ammonium carbonate.

14:31.552 --> 14:32.612
Smelling salts.

14:32.692 --> 14:35.337
They revived him and
then the torture continued.

14:36.010 --> 14:36.821
Yeah.

14:36.955 --> 14:38.988
This is the fatal blow.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.265
A single deep puncture wound.

14:41.430 --> 14:44.305
It breached the femoral artery.

14:44.933 --> 14:47.625
They put the poor lad out
of his misery with a...

14:48.182 --> 14:49.836
Phillips head screwdriver.

14:51.187 --> 14:52.752
Torturer got what he needed.

14:53.019 --> 14:55.309
Boss.
Found out who Fornell is going after.

14:57.049 --> 15:00.108
Rick Azari. 53 years old.
Born in New York City.

15:00.301 --> 15:03.025
One of the most notorious criminals
on the East Coast.

15:03.188 --> 15:06.969
He was a one-time protégé to Colombian
American crime boss Alonzo Torres.

15:07.189 --> 15:09.078
After Torres was sent
to prison by the FBI,

15:09.138 --> 15:11.492
Azari took over. He was 25 years old.

15:11.552 --> 15:13.568
Lot of funerals the year
Azari took over.

15:13.628 --> 15:16.156
And he ruled that way ever since.
Trial for murder

15:16.237 --> 15:17.573
twice, walked both times.

15:17.654 --> 15:19.075
Now the FBI has another shot.

15:19.155 --> 15:21.235
Azari's being charged
for the murder of a drug dealer

15:21.269 --> 15:24.341
by the name of Randall Carlson.
Kale was the only witness.

15:24.452 --> 15:26.124
No wonder Fornell's protecting him.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.690
Azari goes down for murder
if Kale testifies.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.960
- If not...
- Azari walks. Again.

15:32.911 --> 15:34.951
Boss, you're not gonna like this.
Just got an e-mail

15:34.994 --> 15:36.989
from a friend
at the US Marshal's office.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.426
The FBI has signed a deal with Kale.

15:39.486 --> 15:40.514
What kind of deal?

15:40.669 --> 15:42.315
Immediately after the trial, Kale

15:42.375 --> 15:45.024
is going to be put into
the Witness Protection Program.

15:45.765 --> 15:47.750
So even if he did murder Brewer,
we'll never know.

15:47.810 --> 15:50.404
- Will be like he never existed.
- Just like Fornell wants it.

16:00.110 --> 16:02.308
Can't believe Fornell
lied to Gibbs again.

16:02.423 --> 16:05.370
Well, technically, he did not lie.
He just simply withheld information.

16:05.478 --> 16:07.977
But why would one friend
withhold information from another?

16:08.049 --> 16:11.355
Maybe that friend felt
it was the best thing for everyone.

16:12.122 --> 16:14.523
Best for everyone?
Or best for herself?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.564
- Her?
- Or him.

16:17.157 --> 16:18.844
What are you doing, McProbie?

16:19.258 --> 16:20.731
You writing Fornell's eulogy?

16:20.799 --> 16:22.996
- I'm checking Kale's cell records.
- Why?

16:23.056 --> 16:26.297
Because Gibbs is extremely pissed,
and I think that he would want me to.

16:28.519 --> 16:29.579
What are you doing?

16:29.639 --> 16:32.166
Whatever Gibbs would want me
to get started on doing.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.469
Agent Fornell.

16:37.144 --> 16:38.144
Where's Gibbs?

16:38.204 --> 16:39.946
Upstairs. Conference room. Hi!

16:41.832 --> 16:42.832
Bye.

16:47.159 --> 16:49.296
For a guy that's about
to be handed his head...

16:49.356 --> 16:51.292
He seems to have it firmly
on his shoulders.

16:51.352 --> 16:52.707
Calm before the storm.

16:52.787 --> 16:56.621
Gibbs versus Fornell.
It's like Frazier-Ali or Rocky versus...

16:57.619 --> 16:58.643
everyone.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.278
Haven't seen that look
since I proposed to your ex-wife.

17:04.592 --> 17:07.140
- You got something to tell me?
- Spare me the drama, Jethro.

17:07.308 --> 17:09.650
You know damn well I couldn't tell you
about Kale's immunity,

17:09.674 --> 17:12.603
- not without risking my witness.
- Your witness may be a murderer.

17:12.675 --> 17:15.521
Kale was in our safe house
at the time that Brewer was killed.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.559
I'm pretty sure
we've already gone over this.

17:18.474 --> 17:21.862
- Who was babysitting him? You?
- My men. Come on, Jethro.

17:23.066 --> 17:26.358
Prints on an old toolbox? We both
know you don't have a leg to stand on.

17:31.776 --> 17:33.771
- And what's that?
- A leg.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.690
Couple Marines
in Kale's former unit saw

17:36.812 --> 17:39.874
Kale and Brewer arguing
outside a bar last month.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.815
Two drunk Marines bumping chests,

17:44.035 --> 17:45.701
- that's your case?
- The argument

17:45.761 --> 17:47.476
was about a third Marine.

17:48.175 --> 17:51.491
A PFC Michael Strauss.
Also in Kale's unit.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.459
- You talk to him?
- Working on it.

17:53.649 --> 17:55.128
He's on a four-day leave.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.122
Well.

17:56.182 --> 17:58.915
You got a medicated Marine
with an anger-management problem

17:58.975 --> 18:00.530
and his prints at the murder scene.

18:00.599 --> 18:02.372
What is it you're hoping to find,
Jethro?

18:02.505 --> 18:03.505
The truth.

18:09.484 --> 18:10.792
What are you McDoing, McGee?

18:10.852 --> 18:13.696
- - Working on Kale's phone records.
- Thought you already McDid that.

18:13.756 --> 18:16.386
I did.
But as it turns out, all activity

18:16.446 --> 18:18.921
on Kale's cell phone suddenly
stopped three weeks ago.

18:19.011 --> 18:22.403
Well, that makes sense. That is when
he was placed into protective custody.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.638
FBI probably gave him a clean phone.

18:24.807 --> 18:25.807
We would have.

18:25.867 --> 18:29.262
Which is why I've been trying
to breach the FBI's clean phone list.

18:29.322 --> 18:31.479
So far, I have had no luck.

18:32.447 --> 18:34.853
You ever heard of a good
old-fashioned paper trail, McGoo?

18:35.695 --> 18:37.695
'Cause that's what's
on top of your head right now.

18:37.982 --> 18:40.383
I got Kale's phone records
of the last four years.

18:40.443 --> 18:42.286
See that prefix right
in front of your face?

18:42.360 --> 18:45.037
That is Boynton Beach,
Florida, my friend.

18:45.514 --> 18:46.552
Boynton Beach.

18:47.767 --> 18:51.509
You know what they got there?
Sun, sand, old people.

18:51.968 --> 18:53.315
What is your point?

18:53.546 --> 18:57.499
Kale called the same number every
Sunday morning for the past four years.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.897
- What do you think that means?
- His parents.

19:00.090 --> 19:01.569
That's right. Mother.

19:01.642 --> 19:04.145
According to his file,
his only living relative.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.688
You're right.
I will run her phone records and see

19:06.748 --> 19:10.047
- if there's been a new number calling.
- I like to get to the bottom of things.

19:10.123 --> 19:11.409
It's my specialty.

19:14.372 --> 19:17.067
- I did a little research on Azari.
- School paper?

19:17.648 --> 19:18.651
I found out

19:19.203 --> 19:21.861
you two go all the way back
to your probie days.

19:22.324 --> 19:24.316
- 25 years.
- 26.

19:25.413 --> 19:28.513
I knew Azari when he was only a kid,
no more than a lackey.

19:28.914 --> 19:30.834
He was a wheel man for Alonzo Torres.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.862
Until you brought Torres down.

19:35.481 --> 19:37.001
That bust gave me a career.

19:37.087 --> 19:39.021
Meanwhile,
Azari quietly took over the reins.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.300
Killed at least five his first year.
Probably a dozen more since.

19:42.438 --> 19:45.365
It's nature of the job. You cut
one head off, another grows back.

19:45.427 --> 19:46.726
I could have had him.

19:46.863 --> 19:50.206
When I took down Torres, I could
have easily made a deal to get Azari,

19:50.266 --> 19:53.553
but I underestimated him. I thought
he was a harmless little punk.

19:54.181 --> 19:55.497
You made a mistake.

19:55.972 --> 19:56.972
No.

19:58.148 --> 20:00.095
Marrying your second wife
was a mistake.

20:00.178 --> 20:01.204
This...

20:07.127 --> 20:10.432
Azari's long overdue, Jethro.
I want this son of a bitch.

20:11.593 --> 20:12.395
Yeah.

20:12.469 --> 20:15.149
Even if it means giving
your key witness a free pass?

20:15.213 --> 20:17.017
Do me a favor, Jethro.

20:19.249 --> 20:20.250
Stop digging.

20:22.707 --> 20:25.679
I give my word Kale was not involved
in Brewer's death.

20:26.408 --> 20:28.468
Is that what you know, Tobias?

20:29.826 --> 20:31.540
Or is that what you want to believe?

20:34.345 --> 20:35.348
I got it!

20:35.806 --> 20:38.659
A new cell number's been calling
Mama Kale the last three weeks.

20:38.786 --> 20:40.740
Okay, call the number back,
trace it, and...

20:40.800 --> 20:43.304
Done and done.
It's registered to the FBI.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.556
You have his call list?

20:44.616 --> 20:46.417
I got something better.
I got his location.

20:46.477 --> 20:49.760
According to the GPS in Kale's cell,
he's not at the FBI safe house.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.741
- He's in Arlington.
- The hell he is!

20:51.801 --> 20:52.962
Put it up, McGee.

20:54.152 --> 20:57.308
Kale is where I put him. In our safe
house. Safe. He is not in Arlington.

20:59.748 --> 21:01.629
That safe house on wheels, Tobias?

21:01.689 --> 21:03.372
What the hell is going on?
Where's Kale?

21:03.432 --> 21:06.117
- In the bathroom.
- No, he's not. I am watching him!

21:06.177 --> 21:08.116
- He went out the window.
- Damn it!

21:08.420 --> 21:12.015
- He's stopped. 109 Kent Road.
- PFC Strauss' apartment, Gibbs.

21:16.058 --> 21:17.399
Let me know if he moves.

21:20.495 --> 21:23.395
- It's probably best if we hang back.
- Same thing I was thinking.

21:23.461 --> 21:24.789
Couldn't agree more.

21:33.419 --> 21:35.087
- Signal's still there.
- Okay, got it.

21:35.147 --> 21:37.167
Signal hasn't moved.
Kale's still here.

21:39.263 --> 21:40.508
Don't even say it.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.541
What? Through the bathroom window?

21:42.791 --> 21:45.233
You never lost a witness?
Don't answer that.

21:48.561 --> 21:49.561
Kale!

21:51.623 --> 21:52.623
Stop!

21:58.380 --> 22:00.219
Kale, what the hell are you doing?

22:10.566 --> 22:11.580
Don't move.

22:13.547 --> 22:15.369
I'm getting too old for this crap.

22:17.752 --> 22:19.018
I didn't do it.

22:19.919 --> 22:21.325
You didn't do what?

22:24.770 --> 22:25.983
In the bedroom.

22:50.455 --> 22:52.311
Nothing like a good manicure, probie.

22:54.890 --> 22:58.493
- This was nothing like a good manicure.
- Looks like he's pointing at something.

22:58.553 --> 23:01.528
Yeah, same thing. Everything else
in this room is pointing at.

23:01.588 --> 23:05.152
That his good buddy, Kale,
tortured and murdered him.

23:05.946 --> 23:08.344
Why is Kale so intent
on killing his friends?

23:08.423 --> 23:11.463
Maybe the meds he was taking
sent him into a psychotic rage.

23:11.605 --> 23:15.291
Or maybe his friends lied
to him about a romantic attachment.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.237
Torture appears to be
the order of the day.

23:23.359 --> 23:25.002
Looking for these, Doctor?

23:26.056 --> 23:28.612
Traumatic removal
of the fingernails from the...

23:29.090 --> 23:31.278
first, second and third digits
of the left hand

23:31.338 --> 23:33.264
and the second and third of the right.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.544
- That is just wrong.
- Yes.

23:35.604 --> 23:37.118
In some countries,

23:37.505 --> 23:40.960
fingernail pulling is a routine
interrogation technique.

23:41.039 --> 23:44.049
Perhaps someone brought
the technique home with them.

23:44.175 --> 23:46.133
Yes, well, it's not what killed him.

23:46.346 --> 23:49.614
- He has a fractured cervical vertebra.
- Snapped his neck.

23:49.693 --> 23:52.682
Which no doubt interrupted
his central nervous system.

23:54.455 --> 23:55.771
Try to close his mouth.

23:57.550 --> 24:00.460
- Yeah, too much resistance.
- First stages of rigor.

24:00.702 --> 24:04.301
Smallest muscles first.
Hands, feet, jaw.

24:05.299 --> 24:08.459
Yes, it appears this Marine
is trying to tell us something.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.407
But what?

24:11.779 --> 24:14.963
Are you still sure this guy was in your
custody the night of Brewer's murder?

24:15.023 --> 24:16.392
I stand by the word of my men.

24:16.452 --> 24:18.455
Maybe you should stand
by the open bathroom window.

24:18.515 --> 24:20.980
- Azari's trial begins tomorrow.
- That's a red-letter day.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.772
The whole case hinges
on Kale's testimony.

24:22.832 --> 24:24.706
- You can't have him.
- You want Azari to walk?

24:24.766 --> 24:26.680
What's the prosecution's
closing argument?

24:26.740 --> 24:28.507
It takes one murderer to know another?

24:28.804 --> 24:32.439
Kale's not a murderer, boss. At least he
didn't kill Strauss. He couldn't have.

24:32.724 --> 24:35.397
Strauss died at least four hours ago.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.658
That's one hour before
Kale arrived at the apartment.

24:39.718 --> 24:41.718
- I'm taking Kale.
- You can have him.

24:42.057 --> 24:43.839
After I interrogate him.

24:45.553 --> 24:47.727
- Got that look, boss.
- Take him in.

24:48.140 --> 24:50.618
- Got it.
- And don't let him out of your sight.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.962
Told you to ice that, baby.

24:57.021 --> 24:58.407
- Here you go.
- What's that?

24:58.467 --> 25:01.226
My locksmith.
He's really good with bathroom windows.

25:10.708 --> 25:11.708
Move.

25:12.059 --> 25:13.059
Now.

25:13.574 --> 25:15.524
It's okay, Stefano. He's a Fed.

25:16.063 --> 25:18.737
Harmless.
So, you're one of Fornell's boys?

25:19.515 --> 25:20.515
Boys?

25:21.912 --> 25:22.914
NCIS.

25:26.372 --> 25:28.635
You won't have protection
like this in prison.

25:28.715 --> 25:31.220
So, what brings you down here,
Mr. NCIS?

25:32.396 --> 25:35.109
- Two dead Marines.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.563
- Yeah, you will be.
- Must be frustrating?

25:37.623 --> 25:41.048
I mean, a whole army of suits like you
can't take down one guy like me.

25:47.322 --> 25:48.782
Back up.

25:49.625 --> 25:53.220
- Am I intimidating you?
- No only one guy's ever intimidated me.

25:54.352 --> 25:57.493
- He's been in prison for 26 years.
- Well, you're gonna see him soon.

25:58.888 --> 26:01.304
What, this case?

26:01.936 --> 26:03.401
There is no case.

26:03.470 --> 26:05.579
I don't care what those witnesses saw.

26:05.887 --> 26:06.902
You got nothing.

26:15.747 --> 26:18.817
Yeah, boss. The preliminary
police report. I'm on it.

26:19.219 --> 26:20.308
Right, okay.

26:45.059 --> 26:46.931
You lose something there, Tony?

26:47.235 --> 26:50.502
Just my ability to snoop around Ziva's
desk without anyone noticing anything.

26:51.334 --> 26:55.080
Did she say anything specific
to you about taking a trip to Tel Aviv?

26:55.506 --> 26:56.507
Yeah.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.764
She did?

27:03.762 --> 27:05.187
So, what did she say?

27:08.324 --> 27:09.883
That she's taking a trip to Tel Aviv.

27:12.984 --> 27:14.631
Thanks for bringing me up to speed.

27:14.995 --> 27:16.681
By the way, boss wants you to take

27:16.761 --> 27:19.241
a look at the preliminary police
report of Azari's murder case.

27:19.621 --> 27:22.349
The slaying of that drug dealer,
Randall Carlson?

27:23.027 --> 27:25.734
- Why can't we ask Fornell?
- Because the case didn't originate...

27:26.349 --> 27:27.446
with the FBI.

27:28.185 --> 27:30.885
Local Leos handled
the preliminary investigation.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.261
Gibbs asked you to get that file,
didn't he?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.080
Fine, McGee.

27:37.243 --> 27:38.495
I was trying to delegate,

27:38.575 --> 27:40.894
but if you're gonna be too lazy
to take this responsibility,

27:40.918 --> 27:42.290
I guess I will do it myself,

27:42.370 --> 27:44.770
as soon as I finish doing
what you're no longer seeing me do.

27:44.995 --> 27:45.876
Okay.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.879
But you know
Ziva will kill you if she finds

27:47.959 --> 27:50.453
out you're doing what I am
no longer seeing you do.

27:53.703 --> 27:56.160
Then it's a good thing
you're not seeing me do it.

27:58.147 --> 28:00.058
- Hey, Abby-Normal.
- You got to see this.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.645
I would love to,
but listen, I'm kind of busy, and I...

28:04.746 --> 28:05.746
Look.

28:08.157 --> 28:10.036
- Rope.
- It's not just any rope.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.779
It's moldy rope.
And it's not just any moldy rope.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.824
This moldy rope that was used
to tie up Strauss

28:16.104 --> 28:19.411
is the same moldy rope
that was used to tie up Brewer.

28:19.835 --> 28:20.991
I'm sure of it.

28:21.098 --> 28:23.303
Major Mass Spec is still chewing on it,

28:23.567 --> 28:25.103
but I know he's gonna agree with me.

28:25.410 --> 28:27.379
I just have to identify
the strain of mold.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.379
That's pretty interesting.
Listen, I just have...

28:29.460 --> 28:32.048
I'm pretty sure that it's a relative

28:32.129 --> 28:34.092
of stachybotrys chartarum.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.740
I mean, relatively

28:35.800 --> 28:38.305
sure it's a relative,
but you know how relatives can be.

28:38.386 --> 28:41.433
I mean, I still can't believe
that my adorable little niece

28:41.861 --> 28:44.644
is related in any way
to my stinky little brother.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.101
You need to put the mold on hold,
give the rope a little slack.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.838
Boss wants us to take a look
at the original crime involving Azari.

28:50.133 --> 28:51.317
The one Kale witnessed?

28:51.399 --> 28:53.904
The one
Fornell is desperate to reel in.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.394
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

28:57.822 --> 28:59.700
Phosphor? That's weird.

29:00.798 --> 29:04.363
Why would the dead drug dealer
have phosphor on the soles of his shoes?

29:07.348 --> 29:10.142
Why did you sneak away from
the safe house to visit Strauss?

29:10.202 --> 29:11.379
Could have just called.

29:12.549 --> 29:13.549
I did.

29:14.771 --> 29:16.688
- Didn't get an answer.
- Neither have we.

29:16.748 --> 29:17.969
Why did you go see him?

29:18.547 --> 29:19.930
- I was worried.
- Why?

29:21.627 --> 29:23.602
News of Brewer's death
would have hit him...

29:23.808 --> 29:25.352
- pretty hard.
- They were tight?

29:25.994 --> 29:27.270
- Like brothers.
- But you

29:27.350 --> 29:28.965
and Brewer were a different story.

29:29.567 --> 29:32.609
A couple of Marines overheard
a violent argument between you two.

29:37.293 --> 29:38.361
It was nothing.

29:39.822 --> 29:41.451
- Just a disagreement.
- About what?

29:41.715 --> 29:42.715
Money?

29:43.268 --> 29:44.268
Girls?

29:44.892 --> 29:46.405
Iraqi war policy?

29:53.885 --> 29:54.885
Drugs.

29:54.971 --> 29:56.185
Buying or selling?

29:58.599 --> 29:59.599
Using.

30:00.945 --> 30:03.223
- Strauss had a problem.
- Strauss?

30:03.639 --> 30:04.933
Then why fight with Brewer?

30:06.225 --> 30:07.769
I tried to keep the lid on Strauss,

30:08.186 --> 30:09.646
when I was his squad leader.

30:09.869 --> 30:11.361
When I was retired,

30:11.791 --> 30:12.983
that job fell to Brewer.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.193
You thought he was dropping the ball.

30:20.283 --> 30:23.663
It's not easy walking away
from your unit, is it, Sergeant?

30:30.228 --> 30:31.228
No, sir.

30:31.707 --> 30:33.461
You're still looking out for your men.

30:36.786 --> 30:39.155
Tell me what you saw the night
Randall Carlson was murdered.

30:39.215 --> 30:40.677
Don't answer that. Excuse me.

30:44.622 --> 30:47.182
This is an official interrogation.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.601
I'm aware of that, Tobias.

30:48.682 --> 30:51.503
Asking him
about the Azari case is off-limits.

30:51.563 --> 30:54.024
If this guy's testimony
doesn't match up word

30:54.105 --> 30:56.318
- word...
- Well, then, he better get it right.

30:59.812 --> 31:02.790
What did you see
the night of the murder, Sergeant?

31:03.799 --> 31:07.005
I was walking out of the Red Arrow
Diner, walking west on High Street.

31:07.194 --> 31:11.143
Where Randall Carlson, scum-sucking
drug dealer, is parked down the street.

31:12.597 --> 31:13.459
Probie.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.066
Sit. Under that street lamp.

31:15.126 --> 31:17.566
Why do I have to be the lowlife
scum-sucking drug dealer?

31:17.626 --> 31:19.382
If the shoe containing phosphor fits...

31:19.462 --> 31:22.010
Then a car containing Azari and an

31:22.091 --> 31:24.219
associate pulled onto Atchison.

31:24.453 --> 31:25.501
My ninja.

31:26.191 --> 31:27.191
I'm Azari.

31:27.806 --> 31:31.018
- Why you?
- Azari's got swagger, flair, panache.

31:31.189 --> 31:32.378
But I'm the assassin.

31:33.043 --> 31:34.489
Style over substance.

31:36.464 --> 31:38.659
Thank you.
That's very understanding.

31:39.303 --> 31:42.277
The Beemer pulled up
to a late-model Caddy. Azari got out.

31:42.564 --> 31:44.254
The other guy got out of his car.

31:44.314 --> 31:45.862
- Carlson.
- Yeah.

31:46.693 --> 31:47.978
Azari approaches him.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.289
Says a couple of words,
makes a couple of gestures.

31:50.349 --> 31:52.707
A moment later, Azari pulls out a gun.

31:54.254 --> 31:56.085
Azari unloads his pistol into Carlson.

31:56.167 --> 31:57.953
Then Kale saw it all from here.

31:58.198 --> 31:59.852
No, back, far corner.

32:06.714 --> 32:07.714
Good view.

32:07.774 --> 32:09.074
What else did you see?

32:09.358 --> 32:11.643
I saw that lowlife take another life
without even batting

32:11.724 --> 32:12.976
an eye. Isn't that enough?

32:13.560 --> 32:14.561
You feel...

32:14.642 --> 32:17.936
so strongly about it, why did you wait
until morning to report it?

32:20.819 --> 32:21.819
I was scared.

32:24.214 --> 32:25.445
Decorated Marine.

32:25.505 --> 32:26.759
Three tours in Iraq.

32:27.554 --> 32:30.036
Battled Taliban insurgents
in Afghanistan

32:30.117 --> 32:31.578
before that, and you were scared?

32:31.638 --> 32:34.289
You're 30 feet away.
Assuming a two-to-one scale...

32:34.371 --> 32:37.918
Then Kale positively identified
Azari from 60 feet away.

32:38.161 --> 32:40.180
Assuming he had 20/20 vision,
it's possible.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.297
Not possible.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.473
It is anything but possible.
It is impossible,

32:43.533 --> 32:45.478
which is what "not possible" means.

32:47.695 --> 32:48.696
Kale...

32:48.756 --> 32:52.517
would have had to have had more
than 20/20 vision to identify Azari.

32:52.687 --> 32:54.227
He would have need night vision.

32:58.992 --> 33:01.109
The phosphor on Carlson's shoes

33:01.189 --> 33:04.195
- was from a broken streetlight.
- You could have just turned it off.

33:06.161 --> 33:07.230
Yeah. Sorry.

33:07.756 --> 33:09.451
A punk like Azari shows you a handgun,

33:09.532 --> 33:11.411
and all of a sudden,
you turn into a coward?

33:12.981 --> 33:14.385
Yeah, you weren't scared.

33:14.445 --> 33:16.925
You were protecting someone.
Who were you protecting, Sergeant?

33:20.307 --> 33:22.039
Are you sure
the streetlight was busted?

33:22.099 --> 33:24.995
I confirmed it with the City
Street and Sanitation Department.

33:25.055 --> 33:27.260
There is no way Kale
could have seen anything.

33:28.094 --> 33:30.138
Unless he was much closer.

33:31.317 --> 33:33.099
Much, much closer.

33:35.529 --> 33:36.636
Damn you, Kale.

33:38.631 --> 33:40.023
Tell him what you saw.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.033
The truth,

33:43.093 --> 33:44.093
Marine.

33:48.131 --> 33:49.416
Started with Strauss.

33:51.807 --> 33:53.181
He went to score some coke.

33:54.685 --> 33:57.714
Brewer went with him,
but it was just to stop him.

34:00.069 --> 34:02.587
All these guys wanted to do
was deploy to Iraq.

34:03.268 --> 34:04.708
To back up their buddies.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.671
They would've been court-martialed
if they were linked to a coke deal.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.386
They lived to be Marines!
You know what that's like!

34:12.507 --> 34:13.554
You weren't there.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.606
If they said they saw it,
then they saw it.

34:15.666 --> 34:18.435
- You lied. You weren't there.
- I was protecting my men!

34:18.516 --> 34:19.687
Protecting?!

34:19.766 --> 34:21.272
That's some protection, Sergeant!

34:21.513 --> 34:24.853
Your men are both dead,
and you just set their killer free!

34:39.203 --> 34:40.726
I understand. Yes, sir.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.609
- Get him back to the safe house.
- Yes, sir.

34:45.619 --> 34:47.360
He's promoting me, to head monkey.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.420
Kale?

34:48.812 --> 34:50.114
Director wants him on ice.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.081
Case isn't about him.
It's about Azari.

34:52.141 --> 34:53.398
What case?

34:54.717 --> 34:55.717
Are you quitting?

34:55.777 --> 34:57.766
Sometimes it's good to know
when you're beaten.

34:59.162 --> 35:00.669
What do you want me to say, Tobias?

35:01.708 --> 35:02.921
You made a mistake.

35:03.098 --> 35:05.299
It's not the first.
It certainly won't be the last.

35:06.290 --> 35:07.342
Forget about it.

35:07.603 --> 35:08.603
What's next?

35:10.467 --> 35:11.889
Okay, McGee, what do you see?

35:14.294 --> 35:15.767
Crunch Berries cereal.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.561
Okay, now what do you see?

35:20.018 --> 35:22.900
French vanilla ice cream
with chocolate sprinkles.

35:23.474 --> 35:24.498
Interesting.

35:25.303 --> 35:27.411
All right, how about now?

35:34.950 --> 35:36.330
Come on, McGee, say it.

35:37.703 --> 35:38.748
We're grown up.

35:38.830 --> 35:40.083
Sex. Say it.

35:41.191 --> 35:42.960
- Sex.
- Mold sex.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.795
I mean, it's practically mold porn.

35:45.296 --> 35:47.174
Why are you showing me mold porn?

35:47.254 --> 35:50.466
Because,
this stachybotrys chartarum...

35:50.857 --> 35:51.911
was on...

35:52.232 --> 35:53.232
the rope.

35:53.292 --> 35:56.558
The same rope that was used to kill
two Marines in the past two days.

35:56.854 --> 35:59.853
Particularly when you consider
just how rare this mold is.

36:00.444 --> 36:01.611
It's okay, McGee.

36:01.943 --> 36:03.820
It's deadly, but it's sealed.

36:04.321 --> 36:06.443
Now, all I have to do is match it.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.833
Give the guys a little privacy.

36:27.047 --> 36:29.113
Azari has three witnesses
that put him in the park

36:29.173 --> 36:31.260
playing horseshoes
at the time of Strauss' murder.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.814
I got four at a bar playing darts

36:32.874 --> 36:34.845
with Azari at the time
Brewer was ceiling surfing.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.306
Seven witnesses.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.920
All bought and paid for.

36:38.010 --> 36:40.850
He doesn't need to buy anybody.
Gets what he wants through intimidation.

36:42.018 --> 36:44.313
They found Kale's FBI guard
unconscious in the garage.

36:44.394 --> 36:46.065
His gun and his car are missing.

36:46.146 --> 36:48.219
- You got to be kidding me!
- DiNozzo.

36:48.438 --> 36:50.862
Contacting Base Security.
Putting the yard on full lock down.

36:52.194 --> 36:53.194
Ziva.

36:53.329 --> 36:54.865
Security breach at gate six.

36:55.010 --> 36:57.362
FBI car just rammed
through the barrier.

36:57.865 --> 36:59.762
How the hell did
he get off a military base?!

36:59.822 --> 37:01.331
Ask Rivers when he wakes up.

37:02.356 --> 37:04.458
Base Security's designed
to keep people out, not in.

37:04.539 --> 37:06.341
You mean like a bathroom window,
DiNozzo?

37:06.971 --> 37:08.546
Putting a BOLO out on the car, boss.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.504
- Don't need a BOLO.
- We don't need a BOLO.

37:10.699 --> 37:12.217
Get units over to the courthouse.

37:12.528 --> 37:15.942
He has eluded prosecution
from two previous murder cases.

37:16.002 --> 37:18.285
No sign yet of the high-priced
defense team,

37:18.345 --> 37:21.314
but we are still awaiting
the arrival of Rick Azari.

37:21.374 --> 37:23.395
There are more whispers of mistrial
from sources...

37:23.475 --> 37:24.811
I don't see Kale.

37:24.871 --> 37:28.108
Which could mean,
this is Azari's lucky day.

37:28.338 --> 37:29.358
Or his last.

37:29.439 --> 37:31.589
While Azari is actually most known

37:31.649 --> 37:34.049
for his alleged participation
in the expanding

37:34.109 --> 37:35.970
cocaine trade on the East Coast,

37:36.030 --> 37:38.035
- this trial is about murder.
- Yeah, Gibbs.

37:38.116 --> 37:39.951
Gibbs, you're not gonna believe this.

37:40.011 --> 37:42.509
Azari filed a lawsuit
against the contractor

37:42.569 --> 37:44.171
who built his house in Virginia Beach.

37:44.231 --> 37:45.954
- Guess why?
- Mold problem.

37:46.132 --> 37:48.210
An independent lab
ran tests for the lawsuit.

37:48.291 --> 37:50.552
The rare mold
found in Azari's basement.

37:50.928 --> 37:53.924
It matches the moldy
rope used in both murders.

37:54.006 --> 37:57.766
This trial for the murder of Randall
Carlson has been pending for weeks.

37:57.826 --> 37:59.848
He was a Virginia resident with two...

37:59.928 --> 38:01.447
Gibbs, there's Azari.

38:01.507 --> 38:04.150
For the sale and
distribution of narcotics.

38:04.210 --> 38:05.672
He was killed in a late-night...

38:06.176 --> 38:07.236
Go watch it.

38:10.910 --> 38:13.695
Better get out of here by 5:00.
Got reservations at The Palm.

38:15.140 --> 38:16.140
Azari!

38:17.021 --> 38:18.115
You killed my men.

38:19.117 --> 38:20.118
He has a gun!

38:25.258 --> 38:26.750
Don't bother, Stefano.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.921
If he had the balls to pull
the trigger, I'd already be dead.

38:31.312 --> 38:32.312
No!

38:33.628 --> 38:35.734
- Put your weapon down, Jack.
- Listen to him.

38:35.794 --> 38:37.135
Son of a bitch killed my men.

38:37.255 --> 38:39.143
We know that.
We got evidence to prove it.

38:39.203 --> 38:40.741
He'll pay. Not like this.

38:41.845 --> 38:44.184
Come on. Don't get
the kid's hopes up, Toby.

38:44.502 --> 38:46.269
You and I both know
how this is gonna end.

38:47.758 --> 38:48.896
He's right.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.286
- He's gonna walk.
- Trust us, Sergeant.

38:51.346 --> 38:53.645
Yeah, trust them, Sarge.
They got a great track record.

38:53.705 --> 38:55.548
Yeah, keep talking,
and get yourself killed.

38:55.608 --> 38:56.655
By who? Him?

38:58.357 --> 39:00.382
He came here to honor his men, right?

39:00.442 --> 39:02.035
Then have you talk him down.

39:05.923 --> 39:08.062
Put your hands behind your back.

39:19.841 --> 39:20.931
???

39:35.089 --> 39:37.069
I did it for Brewer and Strauss, sir.

39:39.534 --> 39:41.514
Yeah, I know why you did it.

39:44.653 --> 39:48.572
It was here in front of the US
District Courthouse that Rick Azari

39:48.732 --> 39:51.709
the alleged crime boss,
was shot and killed yesterday.

39:51.999 --> 39:55.029
It was just moments before
his murder trial was about to...

40:00.545 --> 40:02.247
Picked a hell of a time to leave.

40:03.246 --> 40:04.996
I will make it up to you.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.240
Hey. Almost forgot.

40:08.532 --> 40:10.433
It's a long flight to Tel Aviv.

40:11.306 --> 40:13.890
If you want, you can borrow this thing.
You know...

40:13.950 --> 40:15.712
Helps you sleep on the plane.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.193
I am flying first class.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.344
Never mind.

40:28.019 --> 40:29.212
Nesi'a tova.

40:33.917 --> 40:35.002
See you next week.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.860
Yeah.

40:51.329 --> 40:53.913
Retired Marine Sergeant Jack Kale

40:54.200 --> 40:58.081
shot Mr. Azari in broad daylight
and in front of our cameras.

40:58.786 --> 41:01.805
Azari and his defense team
had just arrived at the courthouse

41:01.865 --> 41:04.310
when Kale approached, gun in hand.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.826
- A gun we understand...
- You didn't take the shot.

41:07.986 --> 41:09.373
Was too quick for me.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.592
Rivers had been entrusted
with the protection of Kale.

41:11.652 --> 41:13.429
Director want to see you, too?

41:14.163 --> 41:15.628
I invited myself.

41:17.696 --> 41:18.944
You'd do the same.

41:22.539 --> 41:24.134
She said you'd be here.

41:25.312 --> 41:26.312
Who?

41:26.903 --> 41:28.190
Our ex-wife.

41:31.191 --> 41:34.464
- What are you going to tell him?
- Whatever he needs to hear.

41:35.011 --> 41:37.229
Agent Fornell,
the director will see you now.

41:37.516 --> 41:38.516
Thanks.

41:46.889 --> 41:48.394
I should have seen it.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.541
Kale.

41:51.912 --> 41:54.585
Too much detail
about the wrong things.

41:54.660 --> 41:56.841
Too much left out
about the right things.

41:58.452 --> 42:00.273
Maybe I just didn't want to know.

42:00.718 --> 42:04.203
- You gonna tell your boss that?
- I got a kid looking at life sentence.

42:05.188 --> 42:07.257
The director's gonna want to know why.

42:07.317 --> 42:10.255
Yeah, Kale made his decision, Tobias.

42:10.334 --> 42:12.099
Now he's got to live with it.

42:12.381 --> 42:13.534
We all will.

42:13.971 --> 42:16.149
A power struggle is already underway

42:16.209 --> 42:18.644
among those eager
to fill Azari's shoes.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.949
Two of Azari's lieutenants were gunned

42:21.009 --> 42:23.197
down in Southeast DC late last night.

42:23.354 --> 42:26.859
Underworld sources believe
that Azari's former bodyguard,

42:26.961 --> 42:30.001
28-year-old Stefano DelMar,
has already emerged

42:30.169 --> 42:31.684
as Azari's heir apparent.
