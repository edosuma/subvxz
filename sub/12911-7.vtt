00:22.585 --> 00:24.187
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

00:24.387 --> 00:26.589
- Did you like the Costa del Sol?
- Beautiful.

00:26.789 --> 00:29.392
A great hotel and car...
Everything was perfect.

00:29.592 --> 00:30.793
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:32.729 --> 00:35.798
I thought this free trip

00:35.998 --> 00:38.000
might be a scam.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.969
Do I have to buy something from you?

00:40.236 --> 00:43.706
No, just talk about our supermarkets.

00:47.309 --> 00:49.311
Okay, thank you.

00:49.645 --> 00:50.612
Goodbye.

02:00.747 --> 02:02.949
That's all of it.

02:03.149 --> 02:04.951
We didn't even lose one gram.

02:05.885 --> 02:07.687
That's why Don Giuseppe loves you.

02:10.657 --> 02:12.825
C'mon, move it!

02:21.467 --> 02:24.069
Give that kid the Ninja Turtles!

02:29.875 --> 02:31.410
The ball!

02:51.096 --> 02:53.398
Hey kid, you don't have anything?

02:53.598 --> 02:56.634
They ran out of balls
and I don't like dolls.

03:02.740 --> 03:05.343
See this? It's real crocodile.

03:05.943 --> 03:08.346
You're invincible when you wear it.

03:08.546 --> 03:10.147
Really?

03:10.848 --> 03:13.851
See how far I've gotten?
It's not because I'm good!

03:14.685 --> 03:17.588
- It's this talisman.
- And you?

03:17.922 --> 03:19.223
I don't need it anymore.

03:19.823 --> 03:21.291
Thanks a lot.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.093
Wait.

03:23.293 --> 03:26.296
This protects you only if you behave,

03:26.497 --> 03:29.399
if you start thinking
you're a big shot, it won't work,

03:29.533 --> 03:31.168
okay?

03:36.940 --> 03:39.943
- What's the bracelet?
- Let's see it!

03:43.546 --> 03:45.949
Lift your arm, show me.

03:50.019 --> 03:51.020
Hello?

03:52.321 --> 03:53.923
On my way.

04:14.109 --> 04:15.878
What's all this ruckus?

04:16.612 --> 04:19.014
Prince gave the kids presents.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.416
He comes up with a new one
every week.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.519
He used to scrape by
on Conte's paycheck

04:24.719 --> 04:26.755
and now he's got money to burn?

05:03.090 --> 05:05.993
Didn't I tell you? It's the best!

05:06.160 --> 05:09.596
A guy like you
can get six kilos out of one.

05:09.997 --> 05:13.433
I charge you 20% less
than I do the Alliance.

05:13.967 --> 05:16.469
And you don't have to split it.

05:18.138 --> 05:20.740
I don't get this system of yours...

05:20.974 --> 05:22.675
What's to get?

05:23.376 --> 05:25.778
You buy all together

05:25.979 --> 05:28.047
and then split the take
in equal parts, right?

05:28.314 --> 05:29.682
So?

05:30.350 --> 05:32.318
I think it's crap,

05:32.518 --> 05:35.321
because you're letting
the others make money.

05:36.355 --> 05:39.225
I say, the one who sells the most,
earns the most.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.093
Gennaro, what do you want from me?

05:41.293 --> 05:43.496
I told you, Gabriele,

05:43.696 --> 05:46.499
I want a friend in that snake pit.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.735
Besides, no one's got
a head like yours.

05:51.303 --> 05:54.506
Prince, you gotta be number one
in that Alliance.

05:55.174 --> 05:57.175
I carry just one flag,

05:57.376 --> 05:59.978
it's not Ciro's or yours. It's mine.

06:00.545 --> 06:04.116
And I want to see it wave
when the wind blows.

06:04.349 --> 06:05.750
Okay?

07:07.944 --> 07:09.912
I have to work on this stuff first,

07:10.113 --> 07:11.914
we'll make it three,

07:12.148 --> 07:13.950
maybe even four.

07:14.717 --> 07:16.118
It's good.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.762
Tell Malamore not to worry,

07:27.763 --> 07:29.965
Ciro's time will come.

07:30.566 --> 07:33.769
We can hurt him and the Alliance
without killing him.

07:38.774 --> 07:40.342
Prince,

07:40.942 --> 07:44.179
the guy making the most money,
has no protection.

07:45.547 --> 07:47.148
We'll start with him.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.322
I'll tell him, Don Pietro.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.332
Can I say something?

08:08.169 --> 08:09.971
After you kill Prince,

08:10.738 --> 08:12.373
what happens?

08:15.376 --> 08:17.645
If anything happens
to any Alliance guy,

08:18.479 --> 08:21.548
it carries your name,
you'll declare war.

08:21.749 --> 08:24.751
- I think...
- You're not paid to think.

08:26.553 --> 08:29.156
- I say this for you.
- Get out.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.101
From the Seven Buildings, 2,872,000

09:12.301 --> 09:14.336
which brings this month's take

09:14.503 --> 09:17.506
to 7,427,200.

09:20.576 --> 09:22.544
Net of the managing expenses

09:22.745 --> 09:25.848
and 5% for petty cash
for contingencies,

09:26.048 --> 09:27.449
makes...

09:29.952 --> 09:32.754
1,175,973

09:32.954 --> 09:34.956
for the 15% shares

09:35.757 --> 09:40.362
and 371,370 for the alley's 5%.

09:43.732 --> 09:45.099
Prince,

09:45.767 --> 09:47.569
you're the best!

09:52.974 --> 09:56.144
How much longer
do we keep getting just 5%?

09:56.344 --> 09:58.145
I piss on their faces!

09:58.546 --> 09:59.947
Let's go.

10:04.251 --> 10:06.053
Pieces of shit,

10:06.220 --> 10:09.056
they should kiss where we walk.

10:10.424 --> 10:13.026
You made more than anybody this week.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.163
You're getting better than us
this way.

10:16.396 --> 10:20.400
Oh, yeah? Then I'll keep some cash
for myself next week!

10:21.568 --> 10:23.570
If you haven't already!

10:24.237 --> 10:26.039
What's that mean?

10:28.141 --> 10:30.210
If you have a problem, say it.

10:30.377 --> 10:32.979
He means you're good, Gabriele.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.782
You and me have to talk business.

10:36.015 --> 10:39.619
Me and Rosario want to invest,
to launder the money.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.921
We could do it together.

10:42.989 --> 10:46.192
Ciro, this proposal
is an honor for me.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.228
But I manage my money alone.

10:50.796 --> 10:52.798
Okay, but think about it.

10:53.799 --> 10:56.001
The more we launder, the better.

11:24.996 --> 11:26.397
Bye, Gabriele!

11:26.564 --> 11:28.199
Bye, Ciro!

11:48.219 --> 11:50.888
- Like it?
- You bought another one?

11:51.121 --> 11:52.689
It was a steal.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.492
You're hungry for cars?

11:56.994 --> 11:59.196
I went hungry as a kid.

12:16.679 --> 12:18.648
I have a surprise for you too.

12:22.685 --> 12:24.487
Step up.

12:29.992 --> 12:31.961
- Ready?
- Yes.

12:35.731 --> 12:37.233
You're crazy!

12:37.466 --> 12:40.135
- I'm crazy about you. She's yours.
- Mine?

12:40.369 --> 12:43.572
What do I do with her?
Will she fetch a ball?

12:45.107 --> 12:48.110
She's beautiful like you,
a creature from another world.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.711
I'll show her to you.

12:49.911 --> 12:51.713
- Come on, come on!
- Don't, no!

12:54.749 --> 12:56.751
You say we're alike?

12:57.619 --> 13:00.221
- You think I'm unhappy?
- Why?

13:00.422 --> 13:02.424
Because she's unhappy,
she'd like to run,

13:02.624 --> 13:05.426
instead of being chained up.

13:06.027 --> 13:09.430
She's much better off
than in the circus.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.799
She doesn't have to be a clown,

13:12.033 --> 13:14.035
because I respect her.

13:14.902 --> 13:16.704
Know what you are?

13:16.904 --> 13:20.107
A good soul
dropped into a screwy head.

13:29.783 --> 13:33.187
We want him in with us? Why?

13:33.387 --> 13:35.055
Because he has a good head.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.257
Isn't our head enough?

13:37.824 --> 13:39.226
Are you jealous?

13:39.426 --> 13:41.228
I don't like him.

13:41.428 --> 13:43.230
You don't like him,

13:43.430 --> 13:45.832
but you pocketed 1,750,000

13:45.999 --> 13:48.034
thanks to him.

13:48.235 --> 13:50.036
His dealing spot's the biggest one.

13:50.203 --> 13:52.439
No, from one kilo he can make three.

13:52.605 --> 13:56.109
Or maybe four, but he tells us three
and keeps the rest,

13:56.209 --> 14:00.013
that's how he can act like
a millionaire with that black whore.

14:00.213 --> 14:02.815
We want him in with us,
with our money?

14:04.016 --> 14:06.219
I don't like these things.

14:07.220 --> 14:10.623
I don't care if he skims,
he's better than you and all of us.

14:12.691 --> 14:15.694
Never utter those words again.

14:16.061 --> 14:19.965
That's how trouble starts,
and I want no trouble.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.436
Got that?

14:27.806 --> 14:29.207
It's settled.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.842
- Someone's here!
- No way.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.443
I swear!

15:13.450 --> 15:15.252
Sorry, man.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.322
Your dick's gone soft?

15:18.789 --> 15:20.424
Seeing your face!

15:20.590 --> 15:22.592
Son of a bitch!

15:25.395 --> 15:27.197
It's not looking good.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.599
- Dwarf's busted your balls?
- Not only him.

15:30.233 --> 15:33.136
You're busting too many balls,
you spend too much.

15:33.636 --> 15:36.039
- Is it a sin?
- No!

15:36.239 --> 15:37.840
But you know how it is...

15:38.041 --> 15:40.643
The house, the cars,

15:40.843 --> 15:42.845
the parties for
the neighborhood kids...

15:43.446 --> 15:45.715
Now even a panther!

15:45.915 --> 15:49.218
They think you're making money
outside the system.

15:49.385 --> 15:51.387
I make the same money as the others,

15:51.654 --> 15:53.656
but theirs is stuck to their hands.

15:53.823 --> 15:56.058
Gabriele, listen to me...

15:58.460 --> 16:00.029
I care for you,

16:00.262 --> 16:03.031
and I say if you grow too tall
in this world,

16:03.232 --> 16:05.534
someone's always there
to cut you down.

16:05.767 --> 16:09.638
No one will touch me,
I make money for everyone.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.640
They'd just hurt their wallets.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.843
You'd better get yourself
some protection!

16:15.043 --> 16:16.645
You tell him too!

16:17.245 --> 16:19.047
Take my advice,

16:19.247 --> 16:21.116
sell a few cars...

16:21.316 --> 16:23.785
And that animal too...
what's it to you?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.623
I don't want to mourn you.

16:28.856 --> 16:30.625
Neither does she.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.629
Isn't that right?

16:37.398 --> 16:39.267
Don't listen to him.

16:41.836 --> 16:43.838
The money's my protection.

16:44.038 --> 16:46.640
Money won't stop a bullet.

18:28.539 --> 18:30.541
- What's going on?
- I'm done!

18:30.774 --> 18:33.544
- What?
- You heard me, I'm done.

18:33.777 --> 18:35.579
I only serve my family.

18:35.813 --> 18:39.283
- You knew the terms.
- It's not for me!

18:39.483 --> 18:41.752
You can't walk out on this job.

18:41.952 --> 18:44.955
- Get back there and stop this.
- Or you'll shoot me?

18:45.188 --> 18:47.457
Patrizia, he gave you his trust,

18:47.691 --> 18:50.093
you know where he lives,
what he wants to do...

18:50.260 --> 18:54.063
If he feels betrayed,
he'll find someone else to kill you!

19:07.777 --> 19:09.679
I know they're worth more,

19:09.879 --> 19:12.281
but this is all I can give you.

19:12.915 --> 19:15.684
There isn't a line like before.

19:17.853 --> 19:19.488
The keys are in the ignition.

19:19.655 --> 19:21.290
See you.

19:55.256 --> 19:57.291
You're feeling better now?

19:58.426 --> 20:00.828
Now I feel like her, chained up.

20:01.028 --> 20:04.031
Chains kill her, but they save you.

20:10.871 --> 20:13.874
We were better off
when Conte was here,

20:14.074 --> 20:16.877
less money but no fear.

20:17.077 --> 20:19.079
I'm not afraid, you know that.

20:22.883 --> 20:27.053
I'll take a shower and go to work,
will you take me?

20:27.287 --> 20:29.689
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Azmera.

20:29.856 --> 20:31.858
I'd like you to take me.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.667
Good morning, Lady Azmera.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.668
Lady Azmera...

20:42.869 --> 20:45.872
The meal's here for the little one,
will you take care of it?

21:02.554 --> 21:04.156
Careful!

21:12.864 --> 21:14.866
I want you to handle this.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.670
There's a place she won't
bother anyone, take her there.

21:21.039 --> 21:24.042
I can't stand seeing her
all chained up.

21:59.142 --> 22:01.611
- When do you finish?
- Late, at closing.

22:01.812 --> 22:04.514
What? You're the boss!

22:04.681 --> 22:07.083
Right, I set the example!

22:12.122 --> 22:15.358
Put someone outside here, ok?

22:32.908 --> 22:35.744
We're ready, we have men and arms.

22:35.978 --> 22:39.982
But it's not easy like before,
Prince took on protection.

22:40.215 --> 22:42.217
Why now?

22:42.918 --> 22:46.522
We decide to rub him out and he
gets protection, isn't that strange?

22:46.722 --> 22:48.323
I don't know.

22:49.424 --> 22:50.993
Maybe he's pissed someone off...

22:51.259 --> 22:53.328
Or one of us warned him.

22:55.797 --> 22:59.401
What the fuck happened to Patrizia?
Why didn't she come?

22:59.634 --> 23:01.836
She's not well, don't think bad.

23:02.037 --> 23:04.439
Cut the bullshit, Malamore!

23:05.140 --> 23:08.309
I have to talk to her,
look her in the eyes.

23:17.022 --> 23:20.492
- What the fuck...? Why?
- Get out of here.

23:20.692 --> 23:23.561
No, my family's here. Why should I?

23:23.762 --> 23:26.164
You didn't want to go back to him,

23:26.364 --> 23:28.766
now he doesn't trust you anymore.

23:30.134 --> 23:33.338
Patrizia, I won't leave you here!

23:34.572 --> 23:37.175
But why? He thinks I'm a rat?

23:37.375 --> 23:38.976
The thought is enough.

23:39.176 --> 23:42.980
He says he wants to see you,
but how will it end up?

23:48.953 --> 23:50.955
I'll take care of your family.

23:53.157 --> 23:55.159
Patrizia, come here!

24:10.173 --> 24:11.775
It's me!

24:29.959 --> 24:31.961
- You wanted to see me?
- Where were you?

24:32.161 --> 24:35.164
- I was busy.
- Respect me.

24:35.531 --> 24:38.801
I do, I'm risking my life for you.

24:39.768 --> 24:43.572
I deserve a little respect too,
even if I'm a nobody.

24:44.973 --> 24:46.775
What do you want from me?

24:51.146 --> 24:53.982
I want you to really understand
what I'm doing.

24:56.084 --> 24:57.486
Sit down.

25:05.994 --> 25:08.396
I may lose this war,

25:08.596 --> 25:10.898
but I have to fight it,
because this is my home.

25:12.367 --> 25:15.169
Everything I've done
in a lifetime is here.

25:16.337 --> 25:18.139
I have nothing to lose,

25:18.973 --> 25:21.175
all I've got is my dignity

25:21.676 --> 25:24.145
and I won't see it
flushed down this toilet.

25:25.946 --> 25:27.581
Now do you see?

25:30.651 --> 25:33.721
So, when you think,
think about this too.

25:33.921 --> 25:37.524
If you're my eyes and ears,
you gotta think like me.

25:46.099 --> 25:49.269
- Need anything?
- Go back to your duty.

27:03.107 --> 27:06.310
It really pisses me off
we gotta pay Gennaro!

27:07.578 --> 27:10.748
What should piss you off is
when Prince cuts Genny's stuff,

27:10.948 --> 27:13.150
he fucks us, you know?

27:14.585 --> 27:17.387
- Forget it.
- No, go on!

27:19.022 --> 27:21.425
If this gets out,
I'll wring your neck.

27:23.593 --> 27:26.296
He says he cuts it to three,
you believe that?

27:27.764 --> 27:29.966
See how he has all that money,
jewels,

27:30.166 --> 27:32.569
the cars, the house
and the shop for that whore?

27:32.769 --> 27:34.571
With our money.

27:39.609 --> 27:43.212
We'd better wake up before
fuckin' Prince screws us all.

28:19.381 --> 28:22.384
This is an aggression,
like I told you.

28:22.584 --> 28:25.587
They're ex Savastano, they're
not like us, we can't trust 'em.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.788
We gotta respond.

28:27.021 --> 28:30.725
These shits need to see
they can't shoot or offend us.

28:30.925 --> 28:33.528
- How?
- We get revenge.

28:35.096 --> 28:38.599
We shove the gunfire
and bad-mouthin' up Dwarf's ass.

28:38.799 --> 28:40.801
Can't let them think we're takin' it.

28:41.002 --> 28:45.406
Dwarf wants to screw me,
he's waiting for some bullshit.

28:45.973 --> 28:47.942
But I'm doin' no bullshit,

28:48.175 --> 28:50.077
I'll fuck him first.

29:00.254 --> 29:02.422
I can't swallow this thing.

29:02.622 --> 29:05.692
A member of the Alliance
accused me of stealing,

29:05.892 --> 29:08.995
he offended my woman,
then someone shot up her shop.

29:09.196 --> 29:11.798
We don't know who did the shooting.

29:12.132 --> 29:14.334
It's your man who says
Dwarf said something.

29:14.534 --> 29:16.936
I've had it,

29:17.137 --> 29:20.206
it's too much, he didn't say those
things just in front of my man.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.409
This time Dwarf
talked in front of Trak.

29:29.882 --> 29:32.485
For the sake of this Alliance
I can't lie.

29:32.985 --> 29:34.053
It's true.

29:35.020 --> 29:36.622
Hear that, Ciro?

29:37.289 --> 29:38.891
It's all true.

29:39.925 --> 29:43.228
We have a code of respect
and he broke it.

29:43.429 --> 29:46.098
If it weren't for me,
Dwarf would be dead now.

29:46.298 --> 29:47.799
I don't want blood,

29:47.966 --> 29:50.168
but you have to make amends.

29:50.769 --> 29:54.172
Or else that means all of you in here
think like Dwarf.

29:55.006 --> 29:57.409
So there's no alliance here,

29:58.410 --> 30:01.413
just a place to spit shit on others.

30:01.613 --> 30:03.615
I want no part.

30:04.616 --> 30:06.217
I'm gettin' out.

30:29.974 --> 30:31.775
Why are you looking at me?

30:33.510 --> 30:34.978
He's my brother,

30:35.179 --> 30:38.382
if he goes, I go too,
we're the same thing.

30:44.554 --> 30:45.922
Ciro,

30:46.523 --> 30:50.327
if they go, we'll lose
the best money-making spots.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.595
This fuck up can really cost us.

31:30.799 --> 31:34.903
She left the shop keys, she's not
back and doesn't answer her phone.

31:35.103 --> 31:37.706
- You have to find her, Luciano.
- We will, Prince.

31:38.507 --> 31:40.308
Don Ciro's here.

31:52.220 --> 31:54.222
Go look there!

32:01.429 --> 32:03.497
It's all okay!

32:24.718 --> 32:26.386
What the fuck are they doin' here?

32:26.586 --> 32:28.255
It's all okay, don't worry.

32:41.968 --> 32:43.569
- You gotta go.
- Huh?

32:43.770 --> 32:46.372
I'm sorry, we can't do a thing.

33:05.924 --> 33:08.126
What is it, don't you know me?

33:19.638 --> 33:21.673
That's from the Alliance,

33:21.873 --> 33:24.109
Manolo will handle your spot
from now on.

33:24.275 --> 33:26.277
You know why.

33:50.505 --> 33:52.540
You've got a great head, Prince,

33:52.907 --> 33:54.942
that's why I like you.

33:57.578 --> 34:00.147
Others would have taken revenge,
but not you.

34:00.515 --> 34:03.317
You asked them to make amends
in front of everyone.

34:04.452 --> 34:07.455
Then they saw
they could get to Dwarf,

34:07.721 --> 34:09.322
that's why Trak ratted.

34:10.724 --> 34:13.327
You had others
get your revenge for you.

34:17.130 --> 34:20.300
But now you gotta show me
you were in good faith,

34:20.534 --> 34:22.703
and this thing ends here.

34:22.902 --> 34:25.706
Call back the dogs you unleashed,

34:27.074 --> 34:29.376
or this will end bad for everyone.

34:37.317 --> 34:39.118
What do you say?

34:41.286 --> 34:42.889
You're beautiful.

34:45.525 --> 34:49.195
Tell the truth,
some kid's got his eye on you?

34:51.429 --> 34:54.433
- Dad will kill him.
- No, no one.

34:56.202 --> 34:58.204
I'm kidding.

34:59.038 --> 35:00.706
Like this one?

35:00.940 --> 35:02.508
Put it on.

35:04.810 --> 35:06.211
Wait...

35:15.721 --> 35:18.123
- What's this?
- It's Mom's.

35:18.356 --> 35:20.158
Do you mind?

35:28.099 --> 35:29.534
Ciro...

35:53.390 --> 35:54.992
In my house...

35:55.592 --> 35:58.662
- In front of everyone.
- It's your fault, you didn't listen.

35:58.896 --> 36:02.566
- Whose fuckin' side are you on?
- They were all against you.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.469
We wanted a democracy?
My vote's worth one.

36:05.669 --> 36:07.671
But I'm not like all the others,

36:07.871 --> 36:10.574
have you forgotten
what I did for you?

36:11.074 --> 36:13.076
Are you threatening me?

36:14.511 --> 36:16.513
Don't you dare do that again.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.515
I wasn't threatening you,

36:18.715 --> 36:21.985
I wanted to remind you,
because you're leaving me alone,

36:22.185 --> 36:24.787
and I never left you alone, ever!

36:27.323 --> 36:29.892
My blood's on your hands.

36:31.294 --> 36:33.095
They dragged me into this

36:33.329 --> 36:36.732
and maybe Prince and Trak
did the shooting to fuck me,

36:36.899 --> 36:39.702
but I have to save face,
I have to kill them.

36:39.902 --> 36:42.104
- No.
- They gotta pay.

36:42.304 --> 36:45.107
- I have to kill them.
- I've wrapped it up.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.510
You have to do what I say.

36:49.311 --> 36:51.313
This thing ends here.

37:22.677 --> 37:24.845
I didn't shoot up the shop.

37:26.347 --> 37:28.149
I swear on my daughter's life.

37:30.651 --> 37:32.653
I was wrong, I have to apologize...

37:37.891 --> 37:40.093
to Prince and his girlfriend

37:40.494 --> 37:43.697
and I hope you accept my apologies.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.934
This thing's over

37:49.102 --> 37:52.105
and I propose Dwarf
take his dealing spot back.

37:59.412 --> 38:01.414
Anyone disagree?

38:07.353 --> 38:08.621
That's enough.

38:21.901 --> 38:23.569
They're all pissed off,

38:23.769 --> 38:26.772
even if Dwarf got his spot back,
he's lost face.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.875
The others are pissed off,
they hoped to take his spot

38:30.042 --> 38:32.544
and Ciro's fighting
to keep them together.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.147
With all due respect,

38:35.347 --> 38:39.017
if anything happens to one of them
now, it doesn't bear your name.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.952
See?

38:41.519 --> 38:44.889
When you think in the right
direction, you think good.

39:19.123 --> 39:22.726
With this it makes 70,200. Okay.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.562
Hi, guys.

39:27.497 --> 39:29.399
Hello, Don Rosario.

39:34.104 --> 39:36.906
- We're happy it's all resolved.
- Me too.

39:40.543 --> 39:43.146
I want you all to get a bonus,

39:43.713 --> 39:45.848
each and every one,

39:45.948 --> 39:47.417
10% extra.

39:48.117 --> 39:50.786
I'm payin'. Will you do it?

39:50.987 --> 39:52.989
- Okay!
- For everyone!

39:53.589 --> 39:56.258
And Manolo's share goes to his wife.

39:56.459 --> 39:57.460
Why?

40:16.344 --> 40:18.346
Now it's all resolved.

40:18.713 --> 40:20.682
Get rid of this shit.

40:41.936 --> 40:43.337
Hello, Prince.

40:45.706 --> 40:49.710
I can't stand seeing you like this,
you gotta get up.

40:52.546 --> 40:55.949
I'm going to feed the animal,
want to come?

41:05.325 --> 41:06.927
It's like flying!

41:09.062 --> 41:11.064
- Like it?
- Wow!

41:11.665 --> 41:13.033
I'll give it to you.

41:42.461 --> 41:44.063
Get the meat.

41:57.576 --> 41:58.977
Forgive me, Prince.

41:59.177 --> 42:02.781
They threatened Susy, I had
no choice, we're expecting a baby.

42:04.082 --> 42:05.884
Forgive me.

42:09.754 --> 42:11.556
It's okay,

42:11.789 --> 42:13.591
don't worry.

42:18.162 --> 42:20.565
- Hello, Prince.
- Don Pietro.

42:21.632 --> 42:23.000
Nothing personal,

42:23.200 --> 42:26.904
but I have to start somewhere
to straighten things out.

42:29.673 --> 42:33.377
You're wrong,
you'll just complicate them.

42:34.578 --> 42:36.847
I have dealings with Genny.

42:38.482 --> 42:40.417
It's the truth.

42:40.984 --> 42:42.786
He passes his stuff to me
to help me grow

42:42.986 --> 42:45.155
and turn the tables
when the time's right.

42:46.356 --> 42:52.462
Call him if you like.
He's leaving for Honduras today.

42:52.562 --> 42:55.632
- You're one of Genny's cards?
- If you prefer...

42:57.100 --> 42:59.903
I thought my son didn't give a shit.

43:02.972 --> 43:04.374
Know what?

43:05.608 --> 43:07.810
You're worth more for my game.
