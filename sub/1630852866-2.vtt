- (Baga) Episode two, sewing
challenge.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.040
For fucks sake mate.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.840
- Now, to be clear, you're
not impersonating me.

09:42.840 --> 09:46.880
You're creating an original
dress that I would want to wear.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.520
You can use your own hair,
shoes and accessories,

09:50.520 --> 09:54.480
but the rest needs to be
your own original creation.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.160
Using the drag droppings
provided.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.240
- (Jimbo) I'm so excited.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.880
I have been a costume maker for
13 years.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.440
This is the biggest
opportunity of my career.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.720
- Racers, start your engines,

10:09.720 --> 10:12.120
and may the best drag queen win!

10:15.040 --> 10:17.040
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

10:19.120 --> 10:21.760
- There's arms everywhere.
There's legs everywhere.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.400
- (Monique) Who took the green
sequins?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.720
- It's like an uncontrollable
orgy of a mess.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.640
- (Blu) Give me that.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.960
- Don't start with me, missy.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.440
- You touch me one more time.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.040
This is literally a frenzy.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.200
I'm just going to walk.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.200
[Techno Music Plays]

10:39.200 --> 10:40.800
- I'm running for the neon
green.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.760
We see Jimbo going for all of
the gold

10:43.760 --> 10:45.640
Jujube is tweet to the v,

10:45.640 --> 10:48.520
and Cheryl and Baga are just,
just lost.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.200
- I'm feeling so flustered right
now.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.680
- I don't know what to
get there's fuck all here.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.960
- Here we go, another sewing
challenge.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.840
I mean, I will happily take Ru
down

10:58.840 --> 11:00.080
the Essex high street and go,

11:00.080 --> 11:01.640
'Diva you should wear that!'

11:01.640 --> 11:05.800
But making it, darling, let's
just get the furnace ready.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.200
Medic!

11:10.200 --> 11:12.480
- (Baga) Oh my gosh she's
bleeding.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.320
- (Cheryl) What happens?

11:13.320 --> 11:16.720
The scissors open in my hand,
and I sliced my thumb open

11:16.720 --> 11:19.200
We're 30 seconds in and I've cut
myself.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.240
Chop me out, I'm done, I
can't take this any more.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.800
- This is really cool.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.200
This could be a showstopper.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.160
- This is RuPaul's revenge isn't
it?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.080
I told her ball gowns
were over in my season

11:36.080 --> 11:38.880
and now she's getting
me to make one for her?

11:38.880 --> 11:39.720
No offense.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.360
So Janey what are you like
when it comes to sewing?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.400
- I can work a machine.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.240
- Yeah.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.200
- But I'm not like a designer
designer.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.640
Drag Race Holland did not
have design challenge,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.240
so anything that I'm going to
produce here

11:53.240 --> 11:55.960
is going to be fresh,
new, never seen before.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.080
So that might work in
my advantage over here.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.000
I do know that RuPaul
loves a bit of disco.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.600
- Absolutely!

12:03.600 --> 12:04.760
- So I was thinking
something really bright

12:04.760 --> 12:06.080
and sparkly and fun.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.880
Would you say your a great
sewer?

12:07.880 --> 12:10.240
- I know what works for my body.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.040
- Cause you got some little
dark colors going on.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.640
- Yeah I think this is not like
anything else I've brought.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.760
And I thought what else
will no one run to grab

12:17.760 --> 12:19.880
because I don't want to
get like hit in the face.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.960
- You got a pretty face
to smash anyway girl.

12:21.960 --> 12:22.800
[Laughs]

12:29.440 --> 12:31.680
- (Jimbo) This is cool,
very contrast colors.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.560
- So I mean, well I grabbed
this because I thought

12:33.560 --> 12:34.800
I was just going to use this.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.600
- Elegant.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.640
- Right and I, cause that feels
Ru.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.600
I've done three designing
challenges in the past

12:40.600 --> 12:42.120
so I got this, I got this.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.280
so I got this, I got this.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.680
I don't got this, but
what I know about myself

12:49.680 --> 12:51.920
is that whatever needs to get
done,

12:51.920 --> 12:53.440
I'm gonna get it done.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.040
This is her favorite color,
if Ru loves the color,

12:56.040 --> 12:59.600
maybe she won't really
nitpick on the sewing.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.360
- (Jimbo) Right.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.360
- I'm in a mood you know what I
mean.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.120
I was feeling my fantasy,
next thing you know

13:17.120 --> 13:21.200
you're making a frock,
you're making a frock.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.000
Are you having a giraffe?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.400
- If you made say a dress out of
this,

13:24.400 --> 13:26.760
and then a caftan out of
this that went over top.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.040
- Baga, are you just gonna
ask everyone how to do it

13:30.040 --> 13:31.560
or are you going to start.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.680
- (Jimbo) She's doing her
research

13:32.680 --> 13:34.200
- I'm doing my research

13:34.200 --> 13:35.600
- ( Blu) Baga is so capable.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.320
She is filled to the brim with
talent

13:37.320 --> 13:41.720
and I love her to bits, but
she is a lazy old bitch.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.720
Are you going to do a
better job than last time

13:43.720 --> 13:45.120
- Well I could literally
roll around in me own shit

13:45.120 --> 13:47.760
and I think that'd be better
than the last dress I made.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.600
[Laughing]

13:48.600 --> 13:51.720
I mean those Brillo pads I
call it the devils cloth.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.720
This is no offense to you,

13:53.720 --> 13:56.760
in show business you get
the people that you know

13:56.760 --> 13:58.480
like go on the stage and
actually do that acting

13:58.480 --> 14:00.920
and the singing and all that.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.880
That's what I like to do,
like films and TV and acting.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.680
- Baga is just like,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.040
'oh Meryl Streep doesn't sew her
clothes,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.800
RuPaul doesn't sew her own
clothes.'

14:12.800 --> 14:15.600
- These are hard, it's hard in
the public eye and all that.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.160
- Cause the more time you moan

14:17.160 --> 14:19.520
there's less time for you to sew

14:19.520 --> 14:21.960
and the thespian will be
kicked out of drag race,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.720
and I would hate for her to go
home early.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.000
I actually like the bitch.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.560
- What happened to your finger?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.520
- (Cheryl) It is pulsing
right now, but like,

14:40.520 --> 14:42.000
I'm not going to let it effect
me now

14:42.000 --> 14:42.840
so I've just got to keep going.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.280
- So maybe we should
not run with scissors.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.600
What are you making?

14:47.600 --> 14:50.760
- So I've got a pattern for a
cat suit,

14:50.760 --> 14:53.920
but I've also got a pattern for
a dress.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.080
- I don't mean to discourage
you,

14:55.080 --> 14:58.240
if your going to do
pants, the fit on a pant

14:58.240 --> 15:00.800
it has to be puss cause
that's what makes it.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.920
- As long as it's stitched
together

15:03.920 --> 15:07.480
and I'm walking that
runway that's a win for me.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.480
- You're setting yourself up
right now.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.640
- I'm not setting myself up,

I'm just getting myself psyched
up.

outfit to impress Ru is huge.

- I mean I know the
fundamentals,

15:22.960 --> 15:26.000
it's just the execution
that I struggle with.

do a beautiful silhouette

always tried to do too much

enough.

back

ridden a bike in her life.

- Welcome to the BBC.

Look at that jacket.

fabric.

instinct

18:22.720 --> 18:25.200

neon green,

18:25.200 --> 18:26.760
and then I just wanted to up the
ante,

18:26.760 --> 18:29.200
so I saw this kind of olive
green sequin

18:29.200 --> 18:30.920

together.

moment.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.160
The look will be cute, baby,

18:39.160 --> 18:41.160
but you know, just don't look
too close.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.800
- That's a beautiful fabric
there, very stretchy.

that it's stretchy Ru.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.240
[Laughter]

18:48.240 --> 18:51.240
- Well listen, I love beautiful
things

18:51.240 --> 18:53.080
so if it's beautiful I'd wear
it.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.600
Have you learned more
about sewing over the years

18:55.600 --> 18:58.080
- I know its a competition
but I'm over here like

18:58.080 --> 19:00.280
I got to sew something, again!

19:00.280 --> 19:05.120
You know, and sewing is just,
it's, I can't process it

19:05.120 --> 19:08.120
- Well don't freak out
you already have it.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
You have it.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.680
Why do you think I asked you
back?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.560
- Because you love me and I have
it.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.400
[Laughing]

19:14.400 --> 19:15.240
[Laughing]

19:15.240 --> 19:16.080
[Laughing]

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
- Oh do that again I like that.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.480
- Because you love me and I have
it.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.320
[Laughing]

19:20.320 --> 19:21.160
[Laughing]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.000
[Laughing]

19:22.000 --> 19:24.040
I think we need a duet one day.

19:24.040 --> 19:24.880
- Yes!

19:26.920 --> 19:28.840
Do your best, you have it.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.680
- All right.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.200
- I wanna cry.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.120
- You didn't say anything
about my sweater.

19:33.120 --> 19:33.960
[Laughing]

19:33.960 --> 19:35.440
[Laughing]

19:35.440 --> 19:36.280
- Hi.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.240
- (RuPaul) Hi ladies.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.160
- Hey mama Ru.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.040
- Hello

19:39.040 --> 19:43.600
- For me this is a moment I've
dreamed of for so, so long.

19:44.520 --> 19:48.000
I'm so close to Ru I can, oh
smell it.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.000
- So Jimbo your Canadian
sister, Lemon, left last week.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.840
- She did.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.000
- And you've got added
pressure to represent Canada.

19:58.000 --> 19:58.840
- Yeah.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.120
- What effect has that had on
you?

20:00.120 --> 20:02.200
- In the lip-sync I really
wanted to do my best

20:02.200 --> 20:03.840
to try and save my sister,

20:03.840 --> 20:06.440
but it kind of worked out
because

20:06.440 --> 20:08.280
I'm now representing the whole
country,

20:08.280 --> 20:09.480
so its kind of awesome.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.840
- Yeah!

20:10.840 --> 20:15.320
Now you won the first lip-sync
and had to send someone home.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.440
- It was just surreal for me but
it's,

20:17.440 --> 20:18.760
we sign up for this so.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.280
- Yeah it's a game show.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.840
- (Janey) She made me happy
though like.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.360
- It made you happy cause you
got to stay.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.440
- Yes.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.600
- I know Jimbo you're very
creative,

20:27.600 --> 20:28.640
tell me what you're working on.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.200
- So it's basically, I'm
gonna do a strong a shoulder,

20:31.200 --> 20:32.040
and I'm going to be serving
body.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.800
- Wait a minute, your
gonna put on a breastplate?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.680
- For the first time, I know!

20:36.680 --> 20:38.920
- Are you also going to but on
and ass.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.200
- Well I wanna try it, you know.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.040
[Laughing]

20:42.040 --> 20:43.160
See if it'll fit.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.040
I just don't know how to work it
though.

20:45.040 --> 20:45.880
[Laughing]

20:45.880 --> 20:46.720
[Laughing]

20:48.240 --> 20:49.680
- And what about you Pangina?

20:49.680 --> 20:52.920
I have a sense that you know
how to put an outfit together.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.880
- Well I didn't learn how
to sew until I got the call

20:55.880 --> 20:57.080
for this competition.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.040
- Uh-huh.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.600
- I went to take some classes
but I do prefer to sew by hand

21:00.600 --> 21:01.400
- Oh!

21:01.400 --> 21:02.520
- Yeah I love it, it's so
meditative.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.600
- So can you show me your design
there.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.160
Now is that an outfit
that you've worn before?

21:07.160 --> 21:10.480
- No, but I love how you have
your...

21:10.480 --> 21:12.120
- You love how I...go on.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.200
- I love, I love how you have
these

21:15.200 --> 21:18.560
beautiful asymmetrical
looks on your silhouettes.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.920
- (RuPaul) Yes.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.960
- Suddenly I was like
really inspired by like

21:21.960 --> 21:23.600
kind of like the Parisian kind
of effects.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.680
- Sure, yeah!

21:24.680 --> 21:27.720
- And that mood and the
romanticism of it.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.520
- How long have you known how to
sew?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.120
- I know how to sew now for a
small year.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.480
For me it's always the
process of designing

21:34.480 --> 21:35.640
that gets a little...

21:35.640 --> 21:37.760
- Yeah, you don't have
to reinvent the wheel.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.120
The wheel is fine as it
is, you just have to chose,

21:41.120 --> 21:43.040
which wheel you want to do.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.000
- (Monique) So while Ru is
having the walk through,

21:52.840 --> 21:55.440
Baga Chipz she but the
glasses on and said,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.160
'I'm going to sleep.'

22:03.120 --> 22:04.600
I wouldn't do that

22:04.600 --> 22:07.720
I mean that's bold, Ru's in the
room.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.520
Girl, talk about confidence.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.080
- I'm gonna let you get back to
work.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.360
- Would you mind letting me win
today?

22:16.360 --> 22:17.880
[Laughing]

22:17.880 --> 22:18.960
[Laughing]

22:18.960 --> 22:20.440
- I'll think about it.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.040
- Just remember I asked first.

22:22.040 --> 22:22.840
[Laughing]

22:22.840 --> 22:23.680
[Laughing]

22:24.640 --> 22:26.080
- All right I'll let you get
back to work.

22:26.080 --> 22:26.920
- Thank you.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.000
- Thanks mama Ru.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.440
- After my chat with Ru I
am over come with emotion.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.560
I am just on cloud nine.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.440
Oh my God.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.960
And I am I think just
overwhelmed

22:38.960 --> 22:42.360
with how amazing all of this is.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.120
- How did that feel for
you, you've never done that.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.160
- It's crazy, it's been so
crazy.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.920
- Have you been waiting for that
forever?

22:47.920 --> 22:50.200
- Forever, forever, ever and
ever.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.240
- Yeah it's nice

22:51.240 --> 22:54.360
- That's my dream come
true like right there.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.160
- Awe.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.800
- So exciting

22:56.800 --> 22:58.360
- Awe I love you.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.920
- I love you so much.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.560
- (Together) Oh wow!

23:03.560 --> 23:04.400
[Chuckles]

23:12.160 --> 23:13.560
- Oh I hate this.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.760
- Baga how do you feel?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.600
- I had a bit of a Debby
downer, it is what it is.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.240
I'm gonna just fuckin make
something.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.520
- Yes! That's the Baga we know
and love.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.360
- Yeah exactly.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.240
- I've got to make a frock,
I'm not in the mood for it,

23:30.240 --> 23:32.880
but I got to do it, but
I don't want to do it.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.320
So I'm just gonna do it, so lets
do it.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.440
- We all love you and want you
to be here

23:41.440 --> 23:42.560
so hopefully you can do that.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
- I haven't gone yet, fuckin
hell.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.400
[Chuckles]

23:51.760 --> 23:52.600
- This is beautiful.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.840
- Well thank you so much.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.160
I mean I saw this fabric,
it wasn't very me,

23:56.160 --> 23:57.840
but I was like it's Ru.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.320
- Ru and Blu.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.160
[Laughing]

24:01.680 --> 24:03.760
- I find you so inspirational
you know.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.800
- Oh thank you.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.320
- Season 2 that was the
first ever season I watched.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.960
It was my first ever
glimpse of a queen on TV.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.400
- Right.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.360
- So like any tips that you have
for

24:13.360 --> 24:16.040
dealing with everything
I would love to hear.

24:17.400 --> 24:21.360
- Honestly, I've learned
to put these boundaries up.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.800
Me holding on to those
boundaries

24:22.800 --> 24:27.120
have let me be happier and more
centered.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.400
- (Blu) The main thing
I struggled with drag,

24:29.400 --> 24:32.520
I found that I put Blu first,

24:32.520 --> 24:36.960
and she was this beautiful
creature that I turned in to,

24:36.960 --> 24:40.120
and was the only time I
was confident in my body.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.440
Body image has always been
something

24:42.440 --> 24:44.000
that I've struggled with.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.800
But then I found drag and I just
thought,

24:46.800 --> 24:50.880
the only thing that makes me
happy is being this woman.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.960
And that then lead me to
confused about my gender.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.480
I was so happy as Blu that I
was,

24:58.480 --> 25:02.640
there was this gender,
like, dysphoria I suppose.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.520
- Back in my early career out
there

25:05.520 --> 25:07.400
I was working six nights a week,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.440
and I was in drag for most of
the day,

25:09.440 --> 25:11.440
and then people would
give me more attention

25:11.440 --> 25:14.520
and I'd feel like, is
this what people want?

25:14.520 --> 25:18.040
Is this the voice I've been
suppressing all this time?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.000
I've been there myself,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.760
and it was such a struggle for
me,

25:22.760 --> 25:26.600
because it was just all people
wanted,

25:26.600 --> 25:29.000
was this person, this drag.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.480
was this person, this drag.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.320
It's a constant battle
to find your true self.

25:33.320 --> 25:37.440
- (Juju) For the first like
half of my drag career,

25:37.440 --> 25:39.880
we would go and work and we
would be like

25:39.880 --> 25:42.040
this fabulous drag queen.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.640
Then you go back to your hotel
room

25:43.640 --> 25:45.080
and your sitting alone,

25:45.080 --> 25:49.600
and I've had to shift the
way that I perceived things,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.840
because its almost like,
this is the same painting

25:52.840 --> 25:55.920
it's just a different angle
that we're looking at it from.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.720
- At one point I even
thought that I was trans.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.560
- Yeah.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.640
- So for a long time I
just didn't understand

26:03.640 --> 26:06.400
what was wrong with me, why
I wasn't happy with myself.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.960
- (Cheryl) But there was nothing
ever wrong with you, ever.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.200
- (Juju) I was gonna say,
yeah there's nothing wrong.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.360
- I wasn't sure what gender I
was,

26:12.360 --> 26:14.480
I wanted to be maybe trans.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.040
And I had the support of my
partner,

26:16.040 --> 26:17.360
no one else knows about this,

26:17.360 --> 26:19.400
I was completely keeping it
secret.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.040
A lot of things were
floating about in my mind

26:23.040 --> 26:24.880
for those few years, about my
gender,

26:24.880 --> 26:27.360
because I didn't feel
like a male or a woman.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.600
In Northern Ireland it's so far
backwards

26:29.600 --> 26:31.640
that you don't learn about these
things.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.600
For me it was people on this
show finding themselves,

26:35.600 --> 26:38.320
and being on this show
with people like Divina,

26:38.320 --> 26:40.840
who was so well educated,
who made me realize,

26:40.840 --> 26:42.840
gender is such a spectrum.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.160
I don't know where I fall on it,

26:45.160 --> 26:48.920
but I know that I'm not male or
female.

26:48.920 --> 26:49.760
- Yeah

26:49.760 --> 26:50.960
- I'm just somewhere in between.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.240
- You're Blu.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.240
- (Blu) I suppose the
thing that I have learnt

26:54.240 --> 26:55.280
through this whole process,

26:55.280 --> 26:58.640
all these things that you love
about Blu, your character,

26:58.640 --> 27:01.480
is inside you, and will come out

27:01.480 --> 27:02.960
the more you accept yourself.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.240
I feel like there's
still a long way to go,

27:05.240 --> 27:08.880
I don't know enough about all
the genders

27:08.880 --> 27:11.920
and all the pronouns to label
myself.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.120
Maybe I don't even want to label
myself.

27:14.120 --> 27:14.960
- You don't have to.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.040
- But what I know is that,

27:17.040 --> 27:18.560
I'm happy now just
being me wholeheartedly.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.320
- And your happiness is all we
care about.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.680
- We love you too

27:21.680 --> 27:23.400
- (Blu) I love you guys.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.680
Lets have a three way hug.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.200
- It's not the first
time you've done that.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.400
- A three way. It's only week
two.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.240
- Oh my gosh Cheryl.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.480
- I know I'm useless.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.640
- This fabric is a bitch to sew.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.160
Oh girl, I might just
change the idea on this one.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.840
Fuck! What the fuck I'm gonna
do.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.080

46:36.440 --> 46:39.080
I just want to know what more
you've got,

46:39.080 --> 46:40.920
because when you came out as
that cat,

46:40.920 --> 46:43.960
It was like 100 percent feline
fierceness.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.120
I absolutely loved it.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.280
- I've got to say that butch
queen,

46:48.280 --> 46:51.560
was fucking inspired.

46:51.560 --> 46:55.640
It was, I think my favorite
look of everything this evening.

46:55.640 --> 46:56.640
- Thank you.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.320
- Here in this you wear it well
look,

47:00.320 --> 47:01.920
the top half was beautiful.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.960
I just would have loved a bottom
half.

47:04.960 --> 47:08.120
- I'd probably have something
else underneath down below.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
But what you've done with this
piece is,

47:10.120 --> 47:12.760
it's really, really beautiful.

47:12.760 --> 47:13.600
Thank you.

What a journey you've been on
tonight.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.040
You started in Egypt,

47:29.040 --> 47:30.880
then you went to Wentworth
Prison,

47:30.880 --> 47:32.680
and here you are in Studio 54.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.720
- Butch queen right, you
know, I like a dick injection.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.080
You know as much as the next
girl.

47:39.080 --> 47:39.920
[Laughing]

47:39.920 --> 47:41.280
But you know I was getting the
flutters,

47:41.280 --> 47:43.160
and I thought, yeah I could, you
know,

47:43.160 --> 47:45.640
do some bitch things with this
bitch.

47:45.640 --> 47:49.600
You know if she was in her
cell, abso-fucking-lutely.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.960
- The kitty girl for me
was my least favorite.

47:51.960 --> 47:52.760
- Okay.

47:52.760 --> 47:53.840
- If you didn't have ears on

47:53.840 --> 47:58.560
there would have been no
nod to anything kitty.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.040
This is probably the one

48:00.040 --> 48:04.080
that I would chose as
the one Ru would wear.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.680
The shape of it, the disco
stylings.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.520
- I would totally wear this.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.840
It's so cute and simple.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.480
Sometimes simple is the best way
to go.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.320
- Thank you.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.360
- What was your favorite look?

48:17.360 --> 48:20.640
- Creating this one with some
very lovely sisterly advice.

48:20.640 --> 48:21.520
- Who helped you.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.520
- Monique was really sweet.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.280
I was working on a different
fabric

48:25.280 --> 48:26.880
that was not working with me.

48:26.880 --> 48:28.440
And she was like, girl you have

48:28.440 --> 48:30.440
this beautiful color
pallette laying around

48:30.440 --> 48:31.640
you should go with that.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.400
- Oh great cause it fits
beautifully.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.760
Very smart.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.000
- Thank you very much.

48:36.000 --> 48:36.840
- Thanks.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.640
- Thank you.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.680
- Up next, Cheryl Hole.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.920
- When you came out Cheryl,

48:41.920 --> 48:44.120
it was very Marie from
Aristocats.

48:44.120 --> 48:48.280
Which is cute, but I
wanted to see more you.

48:49.480 --> 48:53.360
- I disagree the kitty girl was
very,

48:53.360 --> 48:54.880
very clever, and cute.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.760
I loved the butch queen.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.240
This outfit, I've had many a
friend

49:00.240 --> 49:03.120
dressed like this in
a Wetherspoons toilet,

49:03.120 --> 49:04.320
trying to text their ex.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.160
[Laughing]

49:05.160 --> 49:07.720
But you know I still like it.

49:07.720 --> 49:12.200
- You know Ru would never wear
this, or anything like this.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.640
I know your trying, there's a
sad little feather up there.

49:14.640 --> 49:18.000
So I think this one was
a miss for me tonight.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.720
- Your competing against
the rest of the world.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.240
You need to fight and you need
to

49:22.240 --> 49:25.840
put a bit more into it
I'm afraid Cheryl, sorry.

49:26.680 --> 49:29.200
- I have been caught in
this outfit in the 80s.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.000
When I used to call myself
cupcake.

49:32.000 --> 49:32.880

49:37.360 --> 49:40.680
It's just not, it's not up
to par, and you know that.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.800
- I came into this competition
feeling so confident.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.640
And I was at a breaking point
yesterday.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.480
- Cheryl you are fantastic.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.320
- Thank you

49:50.320 --> 49:53.160
- I know how tough this
competition is.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.200
And if you don't know how to do
something,

49:55.200 --> 49:58.440
you've got to work something
out.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.520
- I'm terribly sorry
for disappointing you.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.680
I know I could do better,
I just, run out of time.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.040
- All right, thank you Cheryl.

50:08.040 --> 50:09.080
- Thank you.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.080
- Up next, Jujubee.

50:11.800 --> 50:16.320
- So kitty girl was just
really kind of basic.

50:16.320 --> 50:19.200
I feel like Juju you haven't
arrived.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.480
I don't know what's going on,

50:21.480 --> 50:23.680
but you need to stop it now,

50:23.680 --> 50:26.920
because look around and see
where you are.

50:26.920 --> 50:30.040
- The butch one when you
came on in that gray outfit,

50:30.040 --> 50:31.800
it looked like you'd gone
through the wrong door,

50:31.800 --> 50:34.360
and was looking for the
canteen or something.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.960
I just wonder whether the real
Juju's

50:36.960 --> 50:39.200
like locked in a cupboard
somewhere and like.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.360

50:42.360 --> 50:46.920

but I just wanted more.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.080
- I would wear this dress.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.320
- Would you, what did you say?

50:49.320 --> 50:50.640
- I would wear this dress.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.440
I would definitely wear that
dress.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.280
- Okay.

50:53.280 --> 50:54.800
- I think that Michelle is
right.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.200
I think your not quite here yet.

50:56.200 --> 51:00.640
You've been around for many
years in this competition.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.760
So we have high expectations.

51:03.760 --> 51:08.240
You have not held up your
end of those expectations.

51:09.360 --> 51:12.280
- Maybe there is a part of
me that hasn't arrived yet.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.160
Maybe okay Juju is here,

51:14.160 --> 51:17.240
and great Juju will be here very
soon.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.160

51:19.160 --> 51:20.280
- Thank you Ru.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.080
- Up next, Jimbo.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.360
- I loved your three outrageous
looks.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.800
I loved the vibrant orange
when you were little Tigger.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.040
And then just when you thought

51:29.040 --> 51:30.560
the hair couldn't get any
bigger,

51:30.560 --> 51:32.600
you come out as this.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.560
- This butch queen look right,

51:34.560 --> 51:37.920
I want a dildo designed on that
look.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.920
Because I know that will make me
squirt.

Grab a towel.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.040
- I've got kids.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.280
- (Michelle) This to me
definitely says RuPaul,

51:50.280 --> 51:51.920
Okay, a cheap RuPaul.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.600
But it definitely says RuPaul.

51:53.600 --> 51:54.400
- Thank you.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.120
- And I love that you went for
it.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.840
- I love it I would wear
it, It's really gorgeous.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.720
All three looks actually were
fun.

knock of version of Ru.

and her outfit was...

55:41.600 --> 55:43.280
- Much better!

55:43.280 --> 55:44.120
[Laughter]

55:44.120 --> 55:44.920
[Laughter]

55:44.920 --> 55:46.400
- (Blu) I don't know if I'd say
that.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.360
But you did get a lot of
help is what I'm saying.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.640
- No I didn't get a lot of help.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.520
I'm not gonna lie I'm
fucking proud of myself,

55:52.520 --> 55:53.920
cause this is the first ever
dress

55:53.920 --> 55:55.840
I've ever made in my entire
life.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.640
- Baga Chipz, she looked
like a Hot Pocket,

55:58.640 --> 56:00.200
wrapped in like pink tinfoil.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.640
Okay, it was like, what is going
on.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.600
It's the only queen who I know

56:04.600 --> 56:07.640
can corset and still give no
silhouette.

56:07.640 --> 56:09.200
That's the gag.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.680
- Silence!

56:11.680 --> 56:14.360
JJ we have some talking to do.

56:14.360 --> 56:15.200
- We do.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.600
- (Jimbo) Going into the
deliberation,

56:16.600 --> 56:18.800
you can smell the fear in the
room.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.480
Hmm, smells like a ticket home.

56:21.480 --> 56:24.200
It also smells kind of
sweet kind of salty.

56:25.880 --> 56:26.880
So lets here it,

56:27.840 --> 56:30.400
what makes you think you
should stay over Juju?

56:30.400 --> 56:33.120
- Realistically, as
much as I love Jujubee,

56:33.120 --> 56:34.920
she's had four opportunities,

56:34.920 --> 56:38.160
and she's done really
well every single time.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.920
On paper Juju should be going,

56:39.920 --> 56:43.280
because I think its time
that I get a chance to show

56:43.280 --> 56:45.600
that I am a global superstar.

56:46.800 --> 56:51.120
- If I ever were to
stumble, land in the bottom.

56:51.120 --> 56:52.920
Will you save me?

56:52.920 --> 56:54.840
- I'm gonna level with you.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.360
You've got two wins under your
belt.

56:56.360 --> 57:00.280
How could I send home a
winner for one little stumble.

57:00.280 --> 57:03.520
You are safe in my eyes.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.600
- I'm getting the impression,

57:04.600 --> 57:08.040
that Cheryl will do anything
I want, if I save her.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.600
She is ready to pop off
my shoes, and rub my feet.

57:10.600 --> 57:11.760
And I think she may have to,

57:11.760 --> 57:13.640
because these shoes are killing
me.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.160
- How you doing, how you
feeling?

57:16.160 --> 57:18.000
- I've obviously been
in the bottom before,

57:18.000 --> 57:19.680
so I know what this feels like.

57:19.680 --> 57:24.320
But I didn't expect to be
in the bottom this soon.

57:25.960 --> 57:28.160
In the back of my mind I
know these girls are like,

57:28.160 --> 57:29.720
'well girl you've had all these
chances,

57:29.720 --> 57:30.800
so what's the point.'

57:30.800 --> 57:33.680
But like the point is RuPaul
asked me to come back.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.240
And this a completely new
competition.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.480
- So sum up for me, why you
think,

57:38.480 --> 57:41.400
that I should keep you over
Cheryl.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.840
- I didn't struggle as much as
Cheryl did,

57:44.840 --> 57:47.640
in the actual challenge in the
workroom.

57:47.640 --> 57:50.040
- Jujubee being a legendary
star,

57:50.040 --> 57:51.920
she is definitely a threat.

57:52.800 --> 57:56.000
But she might be able to help my
bag

57:56.000 --> 57:58.120
latter on into the season.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.080
With some challenges that
I may not be as good as.

58:00.080 --> 58:02.680
You're a strong competitor
in this competition too.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.720
So do I want to be beat by you?

58:04.720 --> 58:06.400
- Do you want to beat the best?

58:07.960 --> 58:09.720
Then beat the best.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.920
- Cause then the crown is twice
as good.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.200
- I don't know where she's
swinging.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.600
I have no idea.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.160
Like I'm still confused.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.240
Are you gonna chose my lipstick?

58:20.240 --> 58:21.560
Or are you gonna chose Cheryl's
lipstick.

58:21.560 --> 58:24.600
I think she's gonna send me
home.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.080
I think she's gonna send me
home.

58:26.080 --> 58:26.880
[Slurping]

58:28.720 --> 58:30.040
- Cheryl's like my best
friend in the whole world,

58:30.040 --> 58:32.480
but I think tonight on that
stage she lost the challenge.

58:32.480 --> 58:35.160
Out of all of us she was the
worst.

58:35.160 --> 58:35.960
- Valid.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.000
- But how many times do
you have to do drag race.

58:42.640 --> 58:43.960
- Lets break it down.

58:43.960 --> 58:45.480
Why you over Jujubee?

58:45.480 --> 58:48.120
- She did well the first three
times.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.480
This is my time back

58:51.480 --> 58:56.120
and I just hope that you
see what I see in myself.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.560
- Am I gonna make my decision
based on,

58:58.560 --> 59:01.520
'yeah you've had your
chance, get the fuck out.'

59:02.440 --> 59:05.600
Or am I gonna be looking at the
challenge.

59:07.400 --> 59:11.640
- But if you do save me, I've
got your back whole heartedly,

59:11.640 --> 59:14.600
because I care about you,
I'm passionate about you.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.440
And I see so much in you.

59:17.280 --> 59:21.000
Sitting in this chair, there
was something not right here.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.080
- Well I want to thank you for
your time.

59:23.080 --> 59:25.440
- Not sure if it's
because she's finally got

59:25.440 --> 59:27.600
the confidence to act like she's
a threat

59:27.600 --> 59:28.680
in this competition.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.600
But she has been very short,

59:31.600 --> 59:33.640
and I'm walking away from this
going.

59:33.640 --> 59:36.040
'Are you gonna send me home?'

59:38.960 --> 59:40.160
- Oh my gosh,

59:40.160 --> 59:44.920
I would never have anticipated
this in my wildest dreams.

59:44.920 --> 59:48.800
That you would be here
begging for your life.

59:48.800 --> 59:51.160
- I'm a fan of Jimbos,
Jimbo is a fan of mine.

59:51.160 --> 59:53.200
We've shared really
special moments already.

59:53.200 --> 59:57.320
So I'm hoping that I don't
have to do too much convincing

59:57.320 --> 59:58.240
for her to keep me.

59:58.240 --> 59:59.960
If I survive this week,

59:59.960 --> 1:00:04.440
I will be a greater version of
Jujubee.

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:06.520
This competition is something I
wanna see

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:08.160
all the way through.

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:11.520
And I want to beat you at the
end.

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.520
- Oh, you bitch.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:16.400
- And I want to lose to
the best if I have to lose.

1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:20.280
- Jujubee, I love her
we've gotten really close.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:24.040
But I know that she is probably
my biggest competition.

1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:29.560
I wanna know, If I keep you does
this mean

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:31.640
that I've got one in the bank
with Juju?

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:33.200
- You didn't even have
to ask me that though,

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:36.480
I would do that, because your
Jimbo.

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:40.840
I'm concerned that Janey
isn't going to keep me.

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:42.600
- Oh could you leave your
drink I'm still thirsty.

1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:43.920
- All right honey.

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:46.720
And I'm really hoping Jimbo
steps up her lip-sync game.

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.920
And doesn't do the Hokey Pokey
again.

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:51.800
- What would you do tiny sofa?

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.880
Oh, your no help at all.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:57.480
[Slurping]

1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:00.360
- Oh great, I wanna watch
some Murder She Wrote.

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:02.520
- But the football match is on.

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:03.960
- Football match, what is that
about?

1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:07.000
- Well the plot is, they
kick a ball into a net.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.080
The End.

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:11.360
- Oh, kay, I guess I
could give that a try.

1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:13.640
[Crowd Chanting]

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.480
- GOAL!

1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:15.320
- Yes!

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:16.400
- Woo!

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:18.480
- Okay well great, that was fun.

1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.280
Now can we watch some Murder She
Wrote.

1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:22.920
- All right games take 90
minutes long.

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:23.880
- Eww.

1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:26.200
- Perfect, let me explain
the offside rules.

1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:28.000
So this...

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.080
- Silence!

1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.680
Bring back my girls.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.520
- There is another queens
future on the line.

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.880
My heart is completely
torn between the two.

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:47.200
I have to consider so much, in
such a short period of time.

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.960
And with all this hair on
my head its hard to think.

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:58.840
- It's an extremely
difficult decision to make.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:02.040
Too many emotions going
on too many thoughts.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:04.880
Am I gonna send away a legendary
star.

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:07.160
Am I gonna go send somebody home

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:09.320
who has so much to prove still.

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.200
Am I making friends here,
or am I making enemies.

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:15.520
What am I doing?

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:21.800
- Welcome back ladies.

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:26.120
Two internationally acclaimed
queens stand before me.

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:29.880
Prior to tonight,

Toya Jam.

Last week if she would have won,

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:57.960
she would have picked
my lipstick to go home.

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.880
Your not making decisions,
I'm going to win this.
