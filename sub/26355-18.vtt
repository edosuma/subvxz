Ugh. I can't believe
you dragged me to The Flow.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.250
- This is gonna suck.
- Oh, knock it off.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.710
It's not gonna be that bad.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.503
Besides, I couldn't
leave you at home.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.797
Last time I did that,
the kids walked in on you

00:48.798 --> 00:50.717
looking at Internet corn.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.266
(quietly): Oh, God,
what I wouldn't do to that.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.477
What? N-No!
No, it's not even mine!

01:01.478 --> 01:02.770
I just clicked on it!

01:02.771 --> 01:06.315
And c-come on,
it's not like it's gay corn.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.775
It's gay corn.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.652
It was baby corn.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.446
(applause)

01:12.447 --> 01:15.657
Hi, ladies,
and welcome to The Flow!

01:15.658 --> 01:18.494

01:18.495 --> 01:20.579
We'll be starting the taping
in just a few minutes,

01:20.580 --> 01:22.498
but I wanted
to come out here personally

01:22.499 --> 01:24.249
and say hi to my fans.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.586
Let's get everyone up, up, up
and dancing like maniacs.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.798

women yelling wildly)

01:58.660 --> 02:00.536
Let's welcome our first guest,

02:00.537 --> 02:03.248
my colleague at Channel 5
and now a best-selling author,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.290
Tricia Takanawa.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.625
(applause)

02:06.626 --> 02:09.336
So, Tricia, tell us
about your book.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.463
I understand it's been
number one on Amazon

02:11.464 --> 02:13.006
for many weeks, long time.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.300
It's called Throw It Away:

02:15.301 --> 02:18.470
The Life-Improving Art
of De-cluttering.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.806
People nowadays own
too much stuff.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.851
I am encouraging them
to throw it away.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.353
Genius! So just
throw everything out?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.563
Not quite.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.773
If it kindles joy, you keep it.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.860
But if no joy,
you throw it away.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.362
Can I look at your phone?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.030
No. Use your activity book.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.992
I already did
all the fun ones at church.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.493
It's very simple.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.788
I came up with it after hiking
to the top of Mount Asia

02:44.789 --> 02:47.207
and meditating
on Epiphany Bridge.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.167
Ah! Peter, these are
Asian techniques,

02:49.168 --> 02:50.502
and they're new to me.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.754
I have to buy this book,
read two chapters,

02:52.755 --> 02:55.090
then leave it on my nightstand
for a year.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.134
That fart was
the lady next to me.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.094
Whatever. I'm getting
that book, Peter.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.096
And it's for reading,
not for killing spiders.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.389
Oh, don't worry, Lois.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.558
I got a better method
for doing that now.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.561
I'm really excited
you're humanely relocating me

03:07.562 --> 03:09.646
to outside your house.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.357
Oh, yeah. Me and the fellas

Kids! Peter! Get down here!

03:29.459 --> 03:32.419
Everyone, I just read
Tricia Takanawa's book,

03:32.420 --> 03:34.504
and it was really inspiring.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.506
She says that when you
de-clutter your house,

03:36.507 --> 03:39.760
you de-clutter your mind and
clear a path to true happiness.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.970
How about a clear path
to dinner, bitch.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.890
So I want everyone to go through
every single item you own,

03:44.891 --> 03:48.477
and if it doesn't kindle joy,
throw it away.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.770
See?

03:49.771 --> 03:53.273
This sweater, it's okay,
but it doesn't kindle joy.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.608
I'm throwing it out.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.693
Now, get to it.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.528
Wow, she's really
all in on this.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.529
Well, she's searching
for something

03:59.530 --> 04:01.281
to fill her empty life.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.908
You remember when
she thought the solution

04:02.909 --> 04:05.452
was putting a lemon slice
in a plain glass of water

04:05.453 --> 04:08.122
for a "very simple
kind of pleasure"?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.460
Ah. Perfection.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.587
And just the thing
to wash down six Xanax

04:15.588 --> 04:17.798
from four different
prescriptions.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.343
Mmm.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.764
Tomorrow, this will seem
like a new idea again.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.687
Oh, my voodoo doll of Mom.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.690
Yeah, totally throw.
It never worked, anyway.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.442
LOIS (in distance):
Ow! What the hell was that?!

04:37.443 --> 04:38.777
Oh. Keep.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.571
(Lois screams)

04:45.785 --> 04:49.079
Box of cords that go to
computers from the 1980s.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.455
Keep.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.292
$70,000 in Camel Cash.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.169
I should've pulled the trigger
on that umbrella. Keep.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.797
Woody and Buzz,
who definitely are not alive,

04:58.798 --> 05:02.426
so I can turn my back...
on them!

05:02.427 --> 05:05.345
Well, I guess
they passed the test.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.557
They're really... not alive!

05:08.558 --> 05:10.517
LOIS (calls):
Peter, what are you
doing up there?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.519
Oh, nothing, Lois.
I was just making sure

05:12.520 --> 05:14.521
I kept my Woody and Bu...

05:14.522 --> 05:16.565
I knew it.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.525
Peter, there's nothing
in your throwaway pile.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.610
I know.
I'm keeping everything.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.530
- Everything kindles joy!
- That can't be true.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.490
Even this old tin can
on a string?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.492
I mean, what are you
even doing with this?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.618
You're a grown man!

05:28.619 --> 05:30.412
Why would you
possibly need this?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.749
If anything is garbage,
this is garbage.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.792
Sounds like
things aren't going well

05:35.793 --> 05:38.795
- at the Griffins.
- This is why no girls allowed.

05:38.796 --> 05:42.133
I hate to do this, guys,
but Peter's been compromised.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.512
Oh, look, my box of ribbons I've
saved from various presents.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.348
Oh, I'm not throwing that out.
That's a good ribbon.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.683
This is a good ribbon, too.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.685
These are all
very usable ribbons.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.395
Hey, little guy.
How's the sorting going?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.939
I'm not getting rid
of my ribbons!

05:58.024 --> 06:01.193
(straining):
I just wanted to know

06:01.194 --> 06:03.653
if I could borrow a ribbon.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.206
You can't kick me
out of my own house.

That your parents
pay for entirely,

pay for entirely

- It's the foundation of my look,

this way, Mom.

Oh. Hi, Brian.
You're carrying clutter,

10:33.257 --> 10:34.758
I'll just throw it out.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.177
Ha! A clean house
means a clean soul,

10:37.178 --> 10:40.096

10:40.097 --> 10:41.598
That was a whole pizza.

start eating it yet.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.772
Yeah, Lois might be
starting to lose it.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.815

a little too minimalist.

Peter, you got to get out.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.247
The truth is I should have
asked you to leave

11:06.248 --> 11:07.582

11:12.838 --> 11:14.923
Yeah?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.341

I can't sleep.

So?

PETER:
I can't sleep.

Will you read me a story?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.893
Peter, I-I'm-I'm in the middle
of something here.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.312
- Like, maybe a Clifford?
- Peter, get out of here!

11:29.313 --> 11:31.231

- No! Not now!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.274

Ugh! Just read him the story.

"Clifford was just too big
for the bathtub."

- Isn't he big, Peter?
- Clifford big!

11:43.077 --> 11:45.537
"So they decided
to hose him in the yard instead,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.330
but Clifford couldn't fit
through the door."

11:47.331 --> 11:48.998

they can kick me out?

Well, who gets
the last laugh now?
