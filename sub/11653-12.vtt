AKU: Long ago in a distant land,

00:04.631 --> 00:08.968
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.972
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.139 --> 00:18.394
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

stepped forth to oppose me.

where my evil is law.

Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.289 --> 00:43.086

deep inside this building

inside that little thing?

09:52.218 --> 09:54.178
Here's the short version, Jackie.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.932
Long before you was born,
or I was born, or anybody was born,

09:58.182 --> 10:01.102
the Neptune jewel was kept
inside this mountain, see?

10:01.352 --> 10:04.313
Now legend has it, it was placed there
by an ancient spirit

10:04.396 --> 10:06.440
who gave the jewel special powers
that would give it control

10:06.565 --> 10:09.443
over all the waters
of the world, see? Yah.

10:10.236 --> 10:12.238
Naturally, Aku wanted the jewel's power

10:12.321 --> 10:14.949
so evil could control
the world, which it should.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.742
But then this no-good

10:16.826 --> 10:20.162
goody two-shoes good-for-nothing
got in the way, see? Yah.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.207

but she beat our boss.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.877

10:47.148 --> 10:48.899
And so earth, wind, and fire

10:48.983 --> 10:51.569
have guarded the jewel
for centuries, see? Yah.

to get his hands on it.

couldn't close the deal,

it's been centuries since anybody's even
thought about it.

to try to swipe the Neptune jewel, yah.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.087

11:10.546 --> 11:13.132
The way you cleaned up
them robot thugs back at the Blue Monkey

17:55.826 --> 17:57.828
Actually, it's Jack.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.705
You!

18:00.122 --> 18:01.331
(GRUNTING)

18:01.957 --> 18:03.917
Uh, what the heck is going on, man?

18:04.376 --> 18:07.588
You will not defeat me so easily.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.172
(GRUNTS)

18:09.256 --> 18:13.260
Yes, it won't be easy,
but it will be worth the effort.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.221
(GRUNTING)

18:17.014 --> 18:18.181
The sword!

18:18.765 --> 18:22.185
Uh, why is Jackie
fighting the big boss, boss?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.563
I don't know, see,

18:24.646 --> 18:27.232
but we better save Jackie
before he ain't no more.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.237
(GRUNTING)

18:33.363 --> 18:35.365
(GROANING)

18:37.367 --> 18:38.410
(GASPS)

18:50.672 --> 18:53.258
(GROANING)

18:54.468 --> 18:57.095
No tricks will save you this time, Aku.

19:02.601 --> 19:03.685
(CLOCK TICKING)

19:03.935 --> 19:05.020
(GROANS)

19:07.105 --> 19:08.148
Aku?

19:08.315 --> 19:10.150
Easy there, Jackie boy.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.652
What? Where am I?

19:11.735 --> 19:12.861
What happened?

19:13.278 --> 19:14.571
(LAUGHING)

19:14.655 --> 19:16.239
Can you believe this guy?

19:16.573 --> 19:19.451
What happened, Jackie,
is that we saved your life.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.370
You what?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.205
Well, you see, you lost
your mind back there

19:23.288 --> 19:25.540
and started to duke it out
with the big boss himself.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.918
So, uh, we nailed you over the head, man.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.878
(LAUGHS) Wham!

19:30.128 --> 19:32.130
Lights out, and, uh, here we are.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.466
Yeah, and we saved you
before Aku had a chance

19:34.549 --> 19:36.551
to put you out of commission permanently.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.012
I cannot believe this!

19:39.638 --> 19:40.722
What's not to believe?

19:40.972 --> 19:43.016
We saved you like you saved us.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.769
No! You do not understand!

19:45.894 --> 19:47.646
You must take me back immediately.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.147
Aren't you listening, Jackie?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.732
We can't take you back.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.485
Aku would destroy you, see? Yah.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.987
Besides, we couldn't even if we wanted to.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.407
When we dragged you out,
Aku's castle disappeared.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.534
Who knows where it'll pop up next?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.130
Hey, what's all this about, anyway?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.048
You got some kind of
death wish or something?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.300
No, you don't understand!

20:17.801 --> 20:19.886
(SIGHS) I have deceived you.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.972
Hey, you mean, uh...

20:22.305 --> 20:23.724
You ain't one of us, man?

20:24.099 --> 20:26.017
No. You are criminals.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.102
It is not honorable.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.229
You see, long ago this land was good.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.065
Its people, honest, but then Aku came...

20:35.652 --> 20:36.945
It does not matter.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.613
My quest continues.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.409
I am sorry about the deception,
but it had to be done.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.494
Now, if you please, the jewel.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.747
Uh, we don't have it, see?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.707
Uh, we gave it to Aku.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.083
Mr. Pibbles?

20:50.417 --> 20:53.295
Uh... (LAUGHING)

20:53.378 --> 20:57.382
Yeah, during all the, uh,
commotion I, uh, I kept it,

20:57.466 --> 20:59.885
you know, for, uh, safe keeping.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.430
Thank you. I must return it
to its proper place.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.016
Wait, Jackie, uh, let us do it.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.144
- Why?
- Well, uh, all this crime business

21:09.227 --> 21:12.147
has suddenly put a,
a bad taste in my mouth, yah.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.900
Yeah, we're going legit, see? Yah.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.277
And for our first gig,
we're gonna return the jewel.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.238
It's the honorable thing to do, yah.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.075
I feel you will be happier
on the path of righteousness.

21:24.534 --> 21:25.869
Good-bye.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.372
(DOOR CLOSES)
Yeah, I think we will, too.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.000
Sucker!

21:32.334 --> 21:33.418
Step right UP!

21:33.502 --> 21:35.712
Get your water right here only.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.590
Five hundred smackers per ounce.
