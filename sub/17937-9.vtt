00:52.400 --> 00:54.270
I thought I asked you
to change the filter!

00:54.320 --> 00:57.190
- Oh, I'm sorry. I was just about to do it.
- Chop chop!

00:57.240 --> 01:00.070
- Don't talk to her like that.
- Oh, look who's up before noon!

01:00.120 --> 01:02.430
I'm serious. She's a
cleaner, not your slave.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.019
Oh, please, I pay her enough, don't I?

01:07.640 --> 01:09.990
Hm?

01:10.040 --> 01:11.710
Be useful, then you can criticise.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.750
I told you, I've got a job.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.710
Oh, yeah. A whipping boy at a local pub.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.310
A real, honest job. Do
you know what that is?

01:20.360 --> 01:21.990
Yeah, but you're worth so much more.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.030
If you just tried, you could be someone!

01:24.080 --> 01:26.880
What, like you -- a bully?

01:29.160 --> 01:30.910
- No wonder Mum left.
- What did you say?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.870
You know, he's right.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.520
It's not my job to make your breakfast.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.840
No, you're right.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.590
Cleaning... is your job.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.480
You have some serious issues!

01:48.240 --> 01:51.240
You know what else your
mother left behind? You!

01:52.880 --> 01:54.830
- What did you say?
- Ah! You want to hit me, huh?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.880
You see, that's what I want to see!
I want to see some fight in you!

02:01.200 --> 02:03.600
Where you going? Kass!

02:16.560 --> 02:18.190
Avast, me hearties!

02:18.240 --> 02:21.070
If you're looking for freebooting
fun for all the family,

02:21.120 --> 02:23.870
head to the Black Dog! Ha-ha-harr!

02:23.920 --> 02:26.150
- Free grog at the Dog.
- And a leaflet for you.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.950
And one for you, sir.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.390
And one for you, madam. Have one of these.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.590
Thank you very much, sir. Ha-ha-harr!

02:33.640 --> 02:36.870
Hey. Where's your gusto, hearty lass?

02:36.920 --> 02:40.270
Look at me. It's embarrassing!

02:40.320 --> 02:42.550
You should've thought of
that when you took my money.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.110
Drop anchor at the Black
Dog, ma'am! You'll love it!

02:46.160 --> 02:47.710
Go on, heave to!

02:47.760 --> 02:50.510
Show me what you've got. Come on!

02:50.560 --> 02:53.030
Want to know what scurvy feels like?

02:53.080 --> 02:55.750
Come and try our food
at the Black Dog Inn!

02:55.800 --> 02:57.590
Maybe you should carry
on getting supplies.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.180
Thanks for all your help. Brilliant(!)

03:00.840 --> 03:02.710
Come to the Black Dog!

03:02.760 --> 03:05.030
Come one, come all! Come have a ball!

03:05.080 --> 03:08.320
All your liver could
require and more! Ha-harr!

03:27.360 --> 03:31.150
Get out! Get out! Don't make me hurt him!

03:31.200 --> 03:32.950
Get out!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.390
Come on, get out! Go, go! Go, go!

03:34.440 --> 03:35.990
(Ssh!)

03:36.040 --> 03:37.870
- Kill-switch!
- Where does it go?!

03:37.920 --> 03:39.660
Go! All right, go!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.400
Do as you're told, get in! Get in!

03:50.400 --> 03:51.950
All right, people, look lively.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.750
I want the van's exact location
radioed through en route, please.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.400
Jen you're with me. Let's go, let's go!

04:10.160 --> 04:12.120
Don't worry, short cut!

04:19.040 --> 04:20.790
Get out!

04:20.839 --> 04:22.440
Easy! Easy!

04:24.400 --> 04:26.140
Go on, then, move!

04:27.640 --> 04:30.800
- Now, open it! - All right, all
right! - Don't you look at me! Do it!

04:42.040 --> 04:44.840
Get your hands through!
Don't you fight me!

04:46.400 --> 04:47.880
Keep still!

04:49.720 --> 04:52.260
Stop wriggling, or I'll have you, boy!

04:56.800 --> 04:58.590
Don't look at me!

04:58.640 --> 05:00.910
Come on, we got to go! Come on!

05:14.360 --> 05:17.230
Check out that camper
for me, Jen, will you?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.150
- You all right, my friend?
- Yeah, yeah. They went out the back.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.790
Jen?

05:31.160 --> 05:35.030
Mike Oscar Two, suspects have fled out
the back of the old fish market on foot.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.950
Do you have eyes on them? Over.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.990
Sorry, sir, there's
hundreds of pirates out here.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.380
So, who am I looking for exactly?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.630
Morning.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.710
Jane Kennedy.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.600
Hi. Thanks. Right.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.870
- Morning. - Morning. - Good morning.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.230
Oh! Why's it always the
gruesome ones in the morning?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.200
Right. White male, mid 40s.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.230
- No other clothes or ID.
- And no face.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.990
Most likely cause of death,
severe blunt trauma to the head.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.440
- That's going to make it
harder to identify him. - Oh!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.990
Come on, Clint, it's your
job. Make yourself useful.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.830
What do you see?

06:24.880 --> 06:27.550
Er... well, he's definitely dead.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.030
You're a natural(!)

06:29.080 --> 06:32.040
Look, tattoo on his forearm.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.870
It's like a skull crossed with
arrows. That could help us.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.400
- See anything else?
- Er...

06:41.240 --> 06:44.550
- There. There's a laceration
on the lower leg. - Good.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.630
Like maybe something was tied around it.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.070
Oh, like a kill-switch for a jet ski.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.590
Yeah! He... he takes a
midnight jaunt at high speed,

06:55.640 --> 06:58.550
falls off and bashes his head,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.390
then comes loose and drifts to shore?

07:01.440 --> 07:02.950
Very good.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.270
Except, why's he in his pants?

07:05.320 --> 07:08.190
- Ah. - Why's he not
in trunks or a wet suit?

07:09.310 --> 07:10.310
It's a mystery.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.630
That's what makes this job so interesting.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.620
- It's too early for mysteries.
- Jane Kennedy.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.760
Is she all right?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.670
No, I'm... I'm on my way.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.950
- I'll be back, I'll be back!
- Where are you going?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.870
Jane!

07:27.920 --> 07:30.110
Right, get statements from
the tourists, will you?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.430
And I need CCTV from that shop.

07:31.480 --> 07:35.270
Oh, and do us a favour, make us a decent
cup of tea, I'm coughing feathers here.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.670
Beth! Are you all right? I was so worried!

07:38.720 --> 07:41.150
- I'm fine Mum, don't stress.
- How come whenever there's trouble,

07:41.200 --> 07:42.630
I always find you right
in the middle of it?

07:42.680 --> 07:45.310
I just wish I could've done
something. It happened so fast.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.390
You did the right thing,
you kept your head down.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.350
You wouldn't have. You'd have seen something
that would have them locked up by now.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.790
Oh, sweetheart, it's
all right to be scared.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.470
- None of us know how we'll
react under pressure. - I do.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.550
You never saw your mum get caught
sneaking down a drainpipe by my old man.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.950
- Talk about rabbit in headlights.
- What?! Mum!

08:02.000 --> 08:04.890
- Er... can I take her home?
- Yeah, we're done.

08:04.940 --> 08:06.230
Can I just finish this tweet?

08:06.280 --> 08:08.470
- I really want to get us trending.
- Come on.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.590
Oh, no! Oh!

08:10.640 --> 08:12.270
What's wrong?

08:12.320 --> 08:15.430
It's Annette. Wants me to pick
up some lamb shanks for dinner.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.230
Not a chance of that now, is there?

08:17.280 --> 08:18.550
Have you got any leads?

08:18.600 --> 08:20.870
I could try the butcher's, I
suppose, or the supermarket.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.470
No. How do you find three pirates
in a town full of pirates?

08:30.880 --> 08:32.220
Open it!

08:38.799 --> 08:40.429
- Morning.
- Morning.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.020
- These need your signature.
- Right.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.110
- And how's Beth?
- Yeah, she's OK.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.190
- Any news on our John Doe?
- Er... not yet.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.910
There aren't any matching
missing persons at present.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.830
No hits on DNA comparison?

08:53.880 --> 08:55.950
Nothing from police database or Interpol.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.590
Also, nothing on fingerprints
or dental records.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.790
You've misspelt "excoriate".

09:01.840 --> 09:04.390
- What about cause of death?
- Er... not yet.

09:04.440 --> 09:10.830
They're testing the blood
for... microbial DNA?

09:10.880 --> 09:11.950
Microscopic life forms.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.790
They're usually present in the
bloodstream if you've drowned.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.150
Lovely. Well, we'll get the
results in a few hours.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.190
He's a genuine mystery.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.270
You know what this means?

09:21.320 --> 09:24.270
It means that we've already got three
open inquests that actually have names.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.620
Can't we just pop this one
to the bottom of the pile?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.840
No. I'm on it!

09:32.120 --> 09:34.270
Hold still, or I'll have your eye out!

09:34.320 --> 09:36.190
We don't want that, now, do we?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.270
You've got longer lashes than I do.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.120
I'm jealous.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.550
They were here, on the table.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.470
I'm off now, Mr Shapur.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.950
Remember? I asked to leave
early for the festival.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.840
Yeah, yeah. Go.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.600
You lost something?

09:59.120 --> 10:02.600
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. Forget I asked.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.030
Kass? It is time to get the
apple keelhauling set up.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.150
Shouldn't you be curled up at home?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.430
Why? Don't think I can handle a few kids?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.150
- I heard you had it rough, is all.
- I'm fine, OK?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.550
Look, Mum and Gran are already
treating me like I'm the victim.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.030
Yeah, well, they're not tough
like you and me, are they?

10:27.080 --> 10:29.270
- A little scare don't keep us down.
- Exactly.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.070
Go on, then, weigh your anchor.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.390
Davy Jones' piñata won't fill itself.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.580
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Yeah.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.750
Ah. You don't miss a trick, do you, Mick?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.670
Those poor tourists don't see him coming.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.990
I'm just proud of our
cultural heritage, that's all.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.190
Here, have you seen the parrot I got in?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.310
Ho-ho-ho! The kids love him!

10:57.360 --> 10:59.990
£5 a photo. My beauty!

11:00.040 --> 11:01.550
Just don't try the grog.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.630
Bottom-shelf booze he can't get rid of.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.310
Tastes like paint-stripper.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.710
Nonsense! That's fine
Latvian cherry brandy.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.790
And a healthy and refreshing
soft drink called Digest.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.590
I'll pass, thanks. I'm here for work.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.630
You ever seen anyone with that tattoo?

11:15.680 --> 11:17.360
Mick!

11:19.240 --> 11:21.350
Here, well, I'm not sure I can say.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.590
I mean, you know, people are entitled to
their privacy in their local.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.790
They'll steer clear if they think I'm
passing on information to you lot.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.960
They won't be coming at all if Food Standards
find out you have a parrot for a bartender.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.350
Well, now I look at it,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.710
the Bull's-eye Buccaneers
have a similar tattoo.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.190
They're a darts team
who play here sometimes.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.990
Got any names?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.350
Yeah, Dick, Tony, I think.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.870
And old Blackbeard.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.030
He's always hanging out on that
rust bucket of his down Catch Quay.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.420
Why don't you go and bother him?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.430
Thank you(!)

11:55.480 --> 11:57.630
Pieces of eight!

11:57.680 --> 11:59.070
Pieces of eight!

11:59.120 --> 12:01.430
That's the one. She's a
nasty lady, ain't she?

12:01.480 --> 12:02.960
Kisses.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.830
Hey, hey, Davey!

12:05.880 --> 12:09.950
Jane thought you might recognise
this tattoo. It's from our John Doe.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.320
No idea, no. Sorry.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.390
How's it going?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.310
Yeah, it's all right.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.550
It's a shame.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.400
This place used to be
the soul of the town.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.670
My uncle used to work here.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.070
When I was a kid, he used to bring back
fish heads and hide them in the garden.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.990
It gave me nightmares.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.630
Look at that! I didn't think
the press would be so bothered.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.230
Hey! You want to tell me what you're
doing walking on my crime scene?

12:40.280 --> 12:44.230
Oh! Er... Don Shapur, Corporate
Acquisitions. I own this.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.470
DS Davey Higgins. I called
your office hours ago.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.910
And here I am. Um... if we
could get this done quickly,

12:49.960 --> 12:52.310
I want to chat to the hacks,
get some free advertising.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.790
What, for an armed robbery?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.040
No publicity is bad publicity.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.430
All right, then. You want to tell me why
they used this building as cover?

13:00.480 --> 13:04.390
How would I know? I've only been here a
couple of times, with potential buyers.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.230
No regular maintenance
staff or builders, or...?

13:07.280 --> 13:09.750
No. I bought this dump for the real estate

13:09.800 --> 13:11.830
and I'll flip it, turn a
cheeky profit, then move on.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.870
That's a shame, isn't it, for all those
locals you're throwing out of work?

13:14.920 --> 13:18.510
Oh, please! What about the
jobs at the new holiday resort?

13:18.560 --> 13:21.150
Well, you want to tell a
third-generation fisherman

13:21.200 --> 13:23.430
to wait tables, you be my guest.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.830
So, what sort of
compensation am I looking at?

13:25.880 --> 13:28.150
They broke into my property,
I'm a victim here.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.100
Well, no-one broke in, they just came
straight through the front door.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.230
- So, they had keys?
- Yeah.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.110
And as the owner, you're
responsible for who has access.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.830
You don't think...?!

13:38.880 --> 13:40.950
Anyone who worked here could have a copy.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.430
Er... no. All the external
locks, they use restricted keys.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.950
Can't be cut by just anyone.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.830
So someone made off with a key.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.750
Do I have to do your job for you?

13:49.800 --> 13:53.070
Rest assured, I'll be
covering every angle.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.390
Actually, could I see your set?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.430
Um... I don't have them right now.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.030
Oh. Missing?

14:01.080 --> 14:04.870
Misplaced. I don't have time to
search for keys, that's your job.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.070
Now, if we're done here, I'd
like to chat to the press.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.790
Thank you, David.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.520
Ahoy there! Welcome to
Captain Blackbeard's boat.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.590
Well, as I live and
breathe, young Jane Kennedy!

14:22.640 --> 14:24.110
How are thee, luvver?

14:24.160 --> 14:25.990
I'm fine, thanks. How are you, Mr Fraser?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.910
You know to call me
Blackbeard. Come aboard!

14:33.480 --> 14:36.830
Whatever happened to that snaggletoothed
little girl who stole my pipe?

14:36.880 --> 14:40.550
Your old mum'll never forgive me
for letting you have that puff.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.510
I'd stay clear still. So, what's all this?

14:43.560 --> 14:45.950
You moved into children's parties?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.800
Well, I'd be twiddling my thumbs else.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.110
No demand for my catch.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.300
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.350
I used to love my dad's stories of
your adventures on the high seas.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.230
Well, I'd complain, but who'd listen?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.390
Shane! Betty! Stop running
around, or you'll fall in!

15:03.440 --> 15:05.780
That's Ruby. I'll introduce you.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.390
Nothing sordid. She's the
wife of a dear friend.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.750
We've teamed up to get
the grockles aboard.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.430
Ruby, come and meet Jane, our coroner.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.990
I used to fish with her
old man, God rest him.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.670
A pleasure.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.190
I won't stay long. I was told
you're part of a darts team?

15:24.240 --> 15:27.150
I'm asking after a man with this tattoo.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.190
Well, look no further.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.270
And your team-mates have the same design?

15:31.320 --> 15:35.550
We got tipsy one night after
checking out on a nine-dart finish.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.990
- Woke up with one apiece.
- What's this about?

15:38.040 --> 15:42.710
I'm sorry to say, but a body's been
found and they have this tattoo.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.230
When did you last see Dick and Tony?

15:46.120 --> 15:49.630
Well, last night. We played
a game at the Captain's Pipe.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.670
I haven't seen either since.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.390
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.710
I'm Dick's wife. What's this about a body?

15:57.760 --> 16:00.870
Er... when did you last see your husband?

16:00.920 --> 16:02.670
Yesterday.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.360
He usually gets in around dawn,
but I didn't see him this morning.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.880
Ms Kennedy, where's my husband?

16:24.600 --> 16:27.150
Robbers dressed as pirates...

16:27.200 --> 16:28.910
There you go, my love.

16:28.960 --> 16:33.280
And remember, only £5 for a
photo with Princess Polly.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.320
Polly? Where are you, girl? Polly?

16:40.680 --> 16:43.670
- Where are you, girl?
- If they'd have hurt our Beth,

16:43.720 --> 16:46.670
I'd have shoved a cutlass
where the sun don't shine.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.910
Clever, though, dressing like pirates.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.830
Looks like they took a leaf
out of your book, Mick.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.670
Here, come on, that's enough of that.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.920
Come on. We've got work to do.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.000
Come on. Come on!

17:06.240 --> 17:08.550
- Going somewhere?
- What? No.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.470
You're holding a bag.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.550
Yeah, er... yeah. I'm
going to go see my mum.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.030
- Oh. Is your dad letting
you out, then? - No.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.109
And if he finds out, I'm going to be stuck,
let's just keep it between us, yeah?

17:21.160 --> 17:22.990
Well, I mean, I normally
report on your every move(!)

17:23.040 --> 17:25.630
I mean it. Keep quiet!

17:25.680 --> 17:27.359
OK.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.910
I'd just like to take a minute
to explain how this works.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.790
- It will be disturbing.
- Can we just do it?

17:41.840 --> 17:45.280
Please. I have to know.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.720
Of course.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.270
What happened to him?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.670
I'm afraid we don't know.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.060
But we will find out, I promise.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.470
Is this your husband?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.040
Yeah.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, that's him.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.310
You don't think he...?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.710
- Oh, God, I can't even say it!
- Think he what?

18:19.760 --> 18:22.760
He's been so depressed
since he lost his job.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.660
He was a shucker down the fish market.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.120
When that shut, something
inside him just turned off.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.390
If we step outside, we
can take a moment to...

18:34.440 --> 18:36.910
It's all right, I can
manage until I get home.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.030
Sorry, I meant just a moment
to complete the paperwork.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.630
Oh.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.630
Yeah. Course.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.360
Thank you. This way.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.150
I'll just be a moment.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.030
Clint? It's me. The wife just confirmed.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.990
Let's get a DNA match as soon as we can.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.350
We've got who, just not the how.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.540
She gave me a photo of him.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.150
OK. Keep your eye on the place,
will you, in case he comes back?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.200
Never far behind, is she?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.510
Fancy seeing you here.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.710
If you're looking for the
elusive Tony, he's not in.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.310
I am. He's one of the last
people to have seen my body.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.870
Not my body, obv... Davey!

19:33.920 --> 19:37.430
- Whatever you get up to after hours
is none of my business. - Grow up!

19:37.480 --> 19:40.030
- Haven't you got work to do?
- Yeah. I'm on the clock.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.310
Tony was the caretaker at the fish market.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.030
So, who better to have a key than him, eh?

19:45.080 --> 19:46.710
Why, do you think our cases are linked?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.150
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Then I could solve it for you.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.110
Oh, please! I got here first.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.950
- But there's no Tony.
- Yeah, I know that,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.510
but did you know Tony had a sweet
old nan who passed away recently?

19:56.560 --> 19:59.030
And she had a cottage sitting empty.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.950
Perfect hiding place.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.590
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm just, er... just taking notes.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.840
- Don't touch anything.
- No.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.270
- Don't let him touch anything.
- He's coming with us! Clint?

20:12.320 --> 20:13.880
Seriously?

20:15.920 --> 20:18.430
Come on, my lovely bird. Come on.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.630
Or you'll be Sunday's roast!

20:21.430 --> 20:22.430
Come on!

20:22.480 --> 20:25.230
- Kiss-Kiss. - Another customer's
come back with a dickey tummy!

20:25.280 --> 20:27.750
I told you, it's that vegan
hot dog stand across the road.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.310
Who knows what goes into them?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.030
It's your bleedin' grog, and you know it!

20:32.560 --> 20:34.110
We've had another throw-up.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.110
All right, all right! Close up
shop, go on get rid of the grog.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.150
Can't you see I'm in serious
negotiations here with the talent?!

20:40.200 --> 20:41.830
Pieces of eight!

20:41.880 --> 20:44.150
Right, now, come on, beautiful.

20:44.230 --> 20:45.230
Come on.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.070
Are you running away?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.790
So what if I am?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.430
Well, where are you going to, to your mum?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.670
- If you know where she is, you
have to tell me. - I don't!

20:54.720 --> 20:56.590
I don't know where she is.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.710
But why did she leave, hm?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.190
What did you do?

21:01.240 --> 21:03.150
I don't know. She left without a word.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.790
She wouldn't do that.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.470
No. She wouldn't just leave
me, unless you made her.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.710
Don't you think I want to know why, huh?

21:10.760 --> 21:13.860
I can't sleep. I keep
thinking, "What went wrong?"

21:14.520 --> 21:18.350
- You can blame me, but she is the
one that walked out on us. - Liar!

21:18.400 --> 21:21.720
What did you do? Did you
hit her, or did you cheat?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.870
What did you do? What did you do?!

21:25.920 --> 21:27.520
Kass! Stop it!

21:30.360 --> 21:33.360
Now that Mum's gone, I've
got nothing left here.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.590
- How are you getting signal out here?
- It's my alarm.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.110
I forgot to pick up those lamb
shanks for Annette yesterday.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.790
I don't want to let her down again.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.790
Right, when we get there, I
want you to stay on the boat.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.110
I don't need the paperwork
if you get hurt.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.830
What, and miss out on all the fun?

22:25.880 --> 22:28.280
How are you so sure Tony's inside?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.750
Hey! Looks like someone's
triggered the dye pack.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.790
Wait a minute, that's not Tony.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.670
That's... that's Richard Hamilton.
That's Ruby's husband!

22:42.720 --> 22:44.550
He's dead, isn't he?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.270
Just pull in over there for us, will you?

23:28.960 --> 23:30.480
Hey!

23:36.680 --> 23:38.270
Dick!

23:38.320 --> 23:41.190
- You see this area, get around the
back there and cut him off! - Yeah!

23:41.240 --> 23:44.080
Dick! I'm getting too old for this!

23:49.600 --> 23:51.750
- I'll take that! - Out of
the way, out of the way! - Oi!

23:51.800 --> 23:52.830
Move! Move!

23:52.880 --> 23:55.190
Out of the way! Not now,
not now! Out of the way!

23:55.240 --> 23:56.720
Clear!

23:58.440 --> 24:00.840
- Did you see where he went?
- No.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.040
Argh!

24:15.240 --> 24:16.910
Any joy?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.270
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Whoa!

24:19.320 --> 24:22.110
This is an actual thieves' hideout!

24:22.160 --> 24:24.310
Oh, it's amazing.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.160
Can I take a selfie?

24:27.120 --> 24:28.600
Oh, sorry.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.510
Well, it looks like there's
only one cash security box here.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.350
We're still missing £50,000.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.750
It's not much use to them now
they're covered in paint.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.830
No, the dye packs are randomised.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.280
I suspect the others will be clean.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.350
Hey, could you put that down,
please? This is a crime scene!

24:45.400 --> 24:47.400
I need to call Forensics.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.510
So, if we just chased off Dick Hamilton,

24:51.560 --> 24:53.270
who's lying in the mortuary?

24:53.320 --> 24:54.910
My guess is Tony.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.390
He's the only member of the
darts team unaccounted for.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.510
Yeah. So that puts your Buccaneers
well and truly in the frame.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.710
I don't think Blackbeard would
be capable of anything so violent.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.470
Well, none of them are, really.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.950
The kind of fellas you tick off
for being drunk and disorderly,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.710
not playing Ocean's Eleven.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.470
- Er... guys? - Hey, put that...
What are you, part magpie?

25:13.520 --> 25:17.110
Look, I think there might be details

25:17.160 --> 25:20.030
of the robbery written
on the back of these.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.150
Oh, yeah.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.160
I'd recognise that handwriting anywhere.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.390
Yesterday's heist... your handwriting.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.190
What are you on about?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.830
Come on, Mick, don't play games!

25:34.880 --> 25:36.950
Give over, Davey, Mick
wouldn't hurt a fly.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.550
This is like having a smoking
gun that's signed, "Love, Mick".

25:39.600 --> 25:40.870
You've got it sideways.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.390
Look, it is possible
that I may, I say may,

25:44.440 --> 25:46.830
- have got a bit mixed up with it.
- You what?!

25:46.880 --> 25:48.310
Look, I didn't mean to, all right?

25:48.360 --> 25:51.710
I was having a couple of drinks with the boys
from the darts team a couple of weeks back

25:51.760 --> 25:55.390
and, you know, we got talking about
the perfect crime, like you do.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.190
Yours was playing pirates.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.710
It's only bloomin' worked, ain't it?

25:59.760 --> 26:02.230
And what about the kill-switch?
That's confidential.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.430
You want to try telling that to the
guards, gossiping over their pints.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.990
You never know who's listening.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.310
It were pub talk. Just
drunken banter with the lads.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.190
I didn't think they'd
go out and do anything!

26:12.240 --> 26:15.590
You know me, Davey, I mean, I might
bend the rules a bit here and there,

26:15.640 --> 26:17.310
but I... I'd never hurt anyone.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.760
I'm sorry!

26:20.760 --> 26:22.760
Come on, Davey, it's me.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.350
All right. But I'll be watching you.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.750
And if I want intel, I expect your help,

26:30.800 --> 26:34.600
otherwise you're going straight to the top
of Lighthaven's most wanted. Fair enough?

26:37.160 --> 26:40.550
- And I'll be watching you an' all!
- Oh, good(!)

26:40.600 --> 26:41.790
Davey, I think I can help.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.630
Ah, no, I've got enough of
your family involved already.

26:44.680 --> 26:47.310
I'm serious. It's Kass.
Something's not right.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.040
Go on, then, lead on, Nancy Drew.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.710
So, we're saying this is Tony now?

26:54.760 --> 26:57.110
No. Not until we get a DNA confirmation.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.950
But the pathologist
confirms the cause of death

27:00.000 --> 27:01.870
was a blunt trauma to the head.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.070
And then the crabs ate his face.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.070
We can't be blamed for
not identifying this.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.920
Not this, him.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.630
We should've waited for DNA confirmation.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.710
Now we've got two families in distress.

27:12.760 --> 27:16.830
Well, look at it like this, now Dick's
family are going to be over the moon he's OK.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.350
Ugh! It's disgusting!

27:19.400 --> 27:20.950
It's not a freak show.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.830
He's not here for your amusement!

27:22.880 --> 27:25.430
All right, don't be annoyed
at me for your mix-up.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.190
No, I'm annoyed because
you're being disrespectful.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.270
- This is a human being!
- Yeah, a really dead one.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.750
Look, I didn't sign up for this.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.670
Yes, you did! We don't
just push paper around,

27:34.720 --> 27:37.630
it is our duty to find out
how and why someone died.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.750
Yes, I know, we speak for the dead.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.990
- Right, and do you know
what that means? - Yes!

27:42.040 --> 27:43.640
Well...?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.760
It means he was someone's son.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.920
Someone's dad.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.720
And it's for the family.

27:57.880 --> 28:01.280
No-one deserves to die
forgotten or ignored.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.390
Are you calling me a thief?

28:08.440 --> 28:10.150
Do I need a solicitor?

28:10.200 --> 28:12.230
I don't know. Do you?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.310
Only if you've got something to hide.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.830
Typical pig.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.670
- Nice(!)
- You ever heard of due process?

28:18.720 --> 28:22.070
I bet you miss the good old days, where
you beat your confessions out of people.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.040
Ask me one I do know.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.830
Did you take a set of
market keys from your house?

28:27.880 --> 28:30.710
They're my dad's keys,
why aren't you asking him?

28:30.760 --> 28:33.300
Why are you packed up, ready to leave?

28:34.160 --> 28:35.700
You told him!

28:38.480 --> 28:41.710
Look, if you suspect
anyone, it should be my dad.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.790
He acts like the big man, but he's broke.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.390
All he's got left is that dump in town.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.670
You might want to redefine
your definition of broke.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.190
- I've seen his car.
- It's all a con.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.590
All he cares about is his image.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.790
Now he's lost his cash and
my mum, he's got nothing.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.520
He's got you.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.150
Why should I care?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.560
It's not like he ever did.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.110
What's in the files?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.310
All Mr Shapur's business history.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.750
Might as well be written in Latin,
for all the good it does me.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.150
Why? What's up? I've got
to brief the top brass,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.350
then I've got to pop by the butcher's.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.070
Er... pathologist report.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.830
Tony, if it is Tony, died of a
severe head injury, not drowning.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.110
Right, so, we can add
murder to the list, then.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.390
Yeah, but there's more.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.710
He's been dead for over
12 hours, which means...

29:33.760 --> 29:35.270
He can't have been part of the robbery.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.030
So you're looking for two
more thieves, not one.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.710
And I still need an
explanation on how Tony died.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.350
Right. Well, I need to
speak to Blackbeard.

29:43.400 --> 29:47.310
I know how you feel about
him, but if the tattoo fits...

29:47.360 --> 29:49.430
Yeah. I'll come with you.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.760
I've got an uncomfortable conversation
to have with a premature widow.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.750
You must be barmy, I'm no thief!

29:58.800 --> 30:01.790
There's three Buccaneers.
One's dead, one's on the run.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.510
Where else am I going to go?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.150
If you want a real pirate,

30:05.200 --> 30:08.110
go and arrest the jackal who
bought up our livelihood!

30:08.160 --> 30:10.550
He's living it up while
the rest of us suffer!

30:10.600 --> 30:13.030
Suffered enough to steal £60,000?

30:13.080 --> 30:16.230
Mrs Hamilton, I'm so sorry,
there's been a mistake.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.270
Your husband is still alive.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.030
- But I saw him.
- So did I.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.030
About an hour ago, running
away from the police.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.830
But he had the same big
gut, the same tattoo.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.270
It's understandable, you were in shock.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.910
- It's not your fault.
- No, it's yours!

30:29.960 --> 30:33.630
You come down here, you get me all
worried, what am I supposed to think?!

30:33.680 --> 30:35.350
I'm... I'm truly sorry.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.870
Oh, you're sorry?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.550
Oh, well, that's all right, then(!)

30:38.600 --> 30:41.030
I just had to tell my
kids their dad's dead.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.470
Can your sorry make up for that?

30:43.520 --> 30:46.350
We've searched the boat, we're
satisfied there's no illegal materials.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.280
What did I tell you?

30:49.360 --> 30:53.190
Ruby... your husband's a suspect
in a robbery and he's on the run.

30:53.240 --> 30:57.400
So if you've seen him or heard from
him, now's a good time to tell me.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.230
- All right. You ready?
- Yep.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.460
Don't leave town, eh? By land or sea.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.470
You should be ashamed.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.230
Protecting them in their ivory towers.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.070
But they laugh at you!

31:13.120 --> 31:16.360
Take off that uniform, you're
just the same as us, Davey!

31:24.280 --> 31:27.200
He's in the food! Stupid bird!

31:38.920 --> 31:40.590
Ah, Mr Shapur.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.670
I wondered if you wouldn't mind
accompanying me to the station, please.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.910
Answer some questions about
the robbery yesterday.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.990
Keep your voice down. I've got a reporter
from the Lighthaven Gazette here.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.470
Oh, right. You're still profiting
from the crime, then, I see.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.630
Perhaps more than I first thought.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.830
Are you so desperate for leads
that you've come here to harass me?

31:57.880 --> 32:00.670
Well, I don't know, you tell me.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.750
It's just I've done some homework
and you're near bankrupt.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.550
Do I look bankrupt?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.710
Oh, no, you've got the nice
clothes and the fancy car,

32:07.760 --> 32:09.550
but I've seen the debts.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.430
- How dare you go snooping...?
- You've even sold this house, haven't you?

32:12.480 --> 32:14.430
On condition you'd rent it back.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.710
I'd have downsized, myself,
but, you know, I'm a simple man.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.560
How do you know...?

32:22.280 --> 32:23.830
My own son.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.150
And I work night and day to
give my family everything.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.000
It's what a man's
supposed to do, you know.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.590
Where did I go wrong?

32:32.840 --> 32:34.390
Am I under arrest?

32:34.440 --> 32:36.630
Well, you've got motive, no alibi,

32:36.680 --> 32:38.310
access to the market.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.870
Found your keys yet? No?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.830
No? OK, then.

32:42.880 --> 32:46.190
- Let's try jogging your memory down
the station then, shall we? - Don't touch me!

32:46.240 --> 32:48.030
You can't wait to tear me down, can you?!

32:48.080 --> 32:50.270
Whatever I've lost, I
will make back again!

32:50.320 --> 32:54.270
You and your pathetic little town,
I will buy you a dozen times over!

32:54.320 --> 32:57.190
Might want to keep your voice down.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.510
I'll see you on the front page.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.270
Um... look, look, I
didn't mean any of that!

33:03.320 --> 33:06.880
Come on, never mind. Like you
say, no publicity is bad publicity.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.870
Do you think Dick's left town?

33:13.920 --> 33:16.950
Gut instinct? No, I don't. I think
he's lying low somewhere, panicking.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.710
He's going to need the rest of the money

33:18.760 --> 33:22.070
and I was thinking, couldn't
Ruby have taken the market keys?

33:22.120 --> 33:24.230
Er... what's that now?

33:24.280 --> 33:27.110
Her reaction to her husband's
body, it didn't feel right.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.310
She was straight back on
the boat the same day.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.590
And at the morgue, it
was all really rushed.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.150
Well, I've seen my fair
share of widows, too,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.150
and no two people react the same way.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.830
Now, could you get out of here, please,
and let me do some police work?

33:38.880 --> 33:42.550
Jim, could you make sure Mr Shapur has had
the chance to speak to his solicitor, please?

33:42.600 --> 33:44.670
I doubt someone like Don
would stoop to burglary.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.030
I can't see him getting his hands dirty.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.750
Well, I don't know, should I ask him?

33:48.800 --> 33:50.950
What, you really think he'd
risk it all for £60,000?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.910
That is why I'm the cop
and you're the coroner.

33:52.960 --> 33:56.190
- What's that supposed to mean? - Well, it's
easy to see the good in dead people, innit?

33:56.240 --> 33:59.430
I know that man. He thinks his money can
protect him, he thinks he's safe. But he's wrong.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.670
But is he guilty? You can't convict a
man just cos you don't like him.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.470
Oh, can't I?

34:09.800 --> 34:11.350
What is that?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.790
- I don't know, sir.
- I picked up your lamb shanks for you.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.239
I didn't want Annette thinking
you don't listen to her.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.390
Hey, love. How are you feeling?

34:57.440 --> 35:00.470
Mum, I'm watching Kass
Shapur by the old slipway.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.270
- What? - Can you just
listen? He's met some woman.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.550
She's older, um... about your age.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.950
- Oh, thanks for that(!)
- She's got two little kids with her.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.600
- Oh, they're kissing.
- Really?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.470
What does she look like?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.520
Beth, what's happening?

35:25.960 --> 35:28.160
She's left her kids with Kass.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.880
OK. Stay there, I'm on my way.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.630
Right, well, I think we'll
leave old Don to sweat a bit.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.110
Hey, I thought I told you
to sit outside Mick's place?

35:37.160 --> 35:39.630
I've got to eat sometime, Guv.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.840
Don't worry. I need to find out more
about Don and his son from Mick, anyway.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.710
Don't get indigestion, will you(?)

35:47.760 --> 35:50.030
And don't forget your siesta(!)

36:04.840 --> 36:07.430
What do you think you're
doing, hm? Are you stalking me?

36:07.480 --> 36:10.150
- I'm not the one sneaking about.
- Yes you are!

36:10.200 --> 36:13.000
Beth, I told you to
mind your own business.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.190
Beth?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.830
You called your mum?

36:17.880 --> 36:20.390
I'm done. Both of you, leave us alone.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.230
Fine. I'll let your dad handle this.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.750
What do you...? Don't call my dad!

36:25.800 --> 36:28.470
What are you doing with Ruby's children?

36:29.360 --> 36:31.990
I love her. She's kind and she's caring,

36:32.040 --> 36:35.040
and when my mum left, SHE was
the one that was there for me.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.670
We're running away together.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.030
We're in love.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.750
- Oh, gross!
- You're 17.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.070
Did Ruby ask you to take the market keys?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.270
No.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.270
Kass, either she stole them, or you did.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.030
And if it was you, you can
forget about running away!

36:52.080 --> 36:54.350
Fine, it was me.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.270
I took the keys, but
it's not what you think.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.070
Her husband's a monster. He said he'd
kill her if she doesn't take them.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.190
Kass, you idiot. She's manipulating you!

37:02.240 --> 37:03.950
Beth, call Clint.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.470
We'll get him to look after the
children while we clear this up.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.230
We ain't going anywhere.
She's coming back.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.040
She promised us.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.270
I need to call Davey.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.510
Well, I think you just have to
admit that you're not always right.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.710
Look, Ruby's involved, I know it.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.950
Get out! I'm warning you!

37:27.000 --> 37:29.710
- Davey, did you hear me?
- Yeah.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.310
I think you may be way off beam this time.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.310
- Yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Cos I'm in the Black Dog now

37:35.360 --> 37:38.950
and I'm looking at Dick, Blackbeard,
and they've both got knives.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.710
- What? - All right, that's enough!
Now, you give me that phone!

37:41.760 --> 37:44.410
- All right.
- Da...?

37:44.560 --> 37:46.670
You take it easy.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.120
Here.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.310
Emergency services. Which
service do you require?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.230
- Police.
- What seems to be the problem?

37:57.280 --> 38:00.230
Yes, there's someone with a
knife at the Black Dog pub.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.470
All right, put the knives
down and we can talk.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.710
Not till Mick gets us out of the country.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.150
- I told you, I can't! - Everyone knows
you're the biggest smuggler around.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.510
He says he's the biggest smuggler around.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.870
You keep her quiet. It
was all part of the plan.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.350
You said you know every
cove and cranny 'round,

38:15.400 --> 38:18.550
- that you'd get us past the
coppers and away. - Oh, did he now?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.070
Please, Davey, Mick finishes what
he started and then we're gone.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.590
For the last time, I'm not involved!

38:24.640 --> 38:27.830
All right, fellas, think, I've
got you for robbery and murder.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.710
You're just going to make this worse.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.070
- We didn't kill anyone!
- I know about Tony.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.110
- That was an accident!
- Shut up!

38:34.160 --> 38:35.950
You know what I think?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.710
I think you three Buccaneers
met the day before the robbery,

38:38.760 --> 38:41.430
Tony got cold feet, you argued,

38:41.480 --> 38:43.550
it got physical and you killed him.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.270
We were scared! We didn't
mean for anyone to die!

38:46.320 --> 38:48.990
Shut your teeth! This is what he wants!

38:49.040 --> 38:51.070
Your mate's head was smashed to a pulp!

38:51.120 --> 38:54.820
- How could that have been an accident?
- He fell overboard.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.910
He got tangled up in the fishing lines.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.710
I tried to winch him up, but
he got bashed against the hull!

39:00.760 --> 39:03.840
- That's what did him in!
- Oh, right. So you panicked.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.670
You panicked, you threw him in the
sea, hoping it'd wash him away.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.550
- Some friends you are!
- What choice do we have?

39:11.600 --> 39:15.750
All I wanted was to ply my
trade, do right by my family!

39:15.800 --> 39:17.830
And they snatched it away!

39:17.880 --> 39:20.630
Three generations working the sea!

39:20.680 --> 39:22.990
And now what are we?

39:23.040 --> 39:26.710
We're clowns, performing for scraps!

39:26.760 --> 39:29.630
The whole town's become
a three-ring circus!

39:30.480 --> 39:33.470
Is that how I'm supposed
to raise my kids, Davey, eh?

39:33.520 --> 39:36.310
Scraping and bowing?

39:36.360 --> 39:39.080
Come on. This isn't you.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.790
What would your kids think
if they saw you now?

39:42.840 --> 39:44.880
What would Ruby say?

39:47.040 --> 39:49.880
Come on, put the knife down, Dick.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.430
Put the knife down.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.280
Come on, it's over.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.110
Give me the knife, Dick,
come on. Give me the knife.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.270
Good man.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.990
It was her idea we came here.
A fine mess she got us in!

40:10.040 --> 40:11.430
Stop your yabbering, you old fool!

40:11.480 --> 40:14.070
- Ruby knows?
- She was in on the robbery, too!

40:14.120 --> 40:17.030
After Tony, we needed a
third man, and she obliged.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.310
- Just shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!
- All right, all right!

40:20.360 --> 40:22.350
Let go of me! Let go!

40:22.400 --> 40:24.350
Mick?

40:24.400 --> 40:26.430
Richard Hamilton, you're under arrest

40:26.480 --> 40:28.310
for robbery and suspected murder.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.350
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence if
you do not mention when questioned

40:32.400 --> 40:34.110
something you later rely on in court.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.400
Anything you do say may be given in
evidence. You understand? Come on.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.320
Come on.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.590
X marks the spot.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.120
Nice touch.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.320
Well, I thought so.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.510
- How'd you find out?
- Kass told me about the keys,

40:57.560 --> 41:02.270
but really, it was your reaction to
the death of your supposed husband.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.670
I didn't buy it.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.670
There's still time, you
know, to let me go.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.470
Why would I do that?

41:07.520 --> 41:10.310
My daughter could've been
hurt because of your greed!

41:10.360 --> 41:13.350
Look, I'm the victim
here. It was Dick's plan.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.510
He killed Tony and forced me into it.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.190
Yeah, well, you could've told me that
when you lied that your husband was dead.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.350
Well, I was going to.

41:21.400 --> 41:25.350
And then I thought, "How often
do you get a chance like this?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.280
"A fresh start?"

41:28.400 --> 41:30.540
See, it's all right for you.

41:31.280 --> 41:36.240
With your high-flying career
and your money, freedom.

41:37.240 --> 41:40.110
I've been trapped here all my life.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.990
You've no intention of going
back for Kass, have you?

41:44.040 --> 41:46.110
So, it's all right to
use a vulnerable boy?

41:46.160 --> 41:47.590
To abandon your own children?!

41:47.640 --> 41:49.190
I never wanted kids!

41:49.240 --> 41:51.510
And guess who got stuck with them?

41:51.560 --> 41:55.310
Besides, they don't
deserve a life on the run.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.990
Look, I'll split it with you!

41:59.040 --> 42:00.990
£25,000 to walk away.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.920
I'm not for sale.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.000
Shame!

42:14.760 --> 42:16.360
Yargh!

42:26.080 --> 42:28.870
Your greedy ways have
caused nothing but trouble.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.710
I am relieving you of
your command, Captain Mick!

42:31.760 --> 42:34.070
You're lucky I didn't make
you swab out the toilets.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.750
- This is still my pub.
- Tell that to your parrot.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.790
- Pieces-of-eight.
- Winged devil!

42:39.840 --> 42:41.670
The crew has spoken!

42:41.720 --> 42:43.190
Ah.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.910
You made it to the front page.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.870
I haven't got that many chins, have I?

42:46.920 --> 42:48.710
Please! That's nothing like you.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.950
Their last pic of me looked
like a grumpy giraffe.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.470
Yeah. Huh! I've got that one framed.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.270
A group of local
entrepreneurs agreed a deal

42:58.320 --> 43:00.710
to buy back the market and
return it to its former glory.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.230
Well, let's hope they
got a decent discount.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.910
I thought that would cheer you up.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.870
Well, it won't be the same,
will it? Things never are.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.110
No? Might be better.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.510
Well, aren't you the sunny optimist!

43:12.560 --> 43:14.640
I just think things have a
way of coming back around.
