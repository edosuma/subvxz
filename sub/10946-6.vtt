WEBVTT

00:00.357 --> 00:01.505
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.525 --> 00:05.349
Scott couldn't guarantee I'd stay on,
so I took that job at the reserve.

00:05.369 --> 00:06.366
Are you okay?

00:06.406 --> 00:07.773
Be exciting to start something new.

00:07.807 --> 00:09.308
These poachers aren't
just a bunch of yahoos

00:09.343 --> 00:10.776
shooting deer out of season.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.040
Don't you want to stop this?

00:12.060 --> 00:14.708
What I really want is to go
home after work in one piece.

00:14.728 --> 00:18.083
It's because you did such a
good job taking care of this guy

00:18.118 --> 00:19.785
that Ty says he's healthy enough

00:19.819 --> 00:21.769
to go to a wolf sanctuary at all.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.823
Guys, they brought a keg!
Everybody grab a beer.

00:25.111 --> 00:26.725
I know; I'm fired.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.593
You are gonna clean up this place

00:28.628 --> 00:31.764
until it looks brand new!

00:32.036 --> 00:33.447
And then you're fired.

00:34.899 --> 00:37.002
If you keep sticking
your nose where it don't belong,

00:37.036 --> 00:39.094
you're a dead man!

00:55.620 --> 00:56.999
Hey, Scott.

00:58.924 --> 01:02.348
Sure. Yeah, I can come have a look at him.

01:02.931 --> 01:04.328
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:04.785 --> 01:06.522
Okay.

01:19.511 --> 01:21.478
Yeah, that pups in great shape.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.288
But don't worry.

01:23.308 --> 01:26.450
The sanctuary he's going to
uses the soft-release method.

01:26.484 --> 01:27.584
- What's that?
- Oh, it's awesome.

01:27.619 --> 01:28.985
They'll take this little guy

01:29.020 --> 01:31.054
and put him in a huge fenced-off area,

01:31.088 --> 01:33.023
with a bunch of other wolves,

01:33.057 --> 01:35.225
so he can slowly acclimate
back into the wild.

01:35.259 --> 01:37.694
You know, kinda...
get back into the swing of things.

01:37.728 --> 01:40.463
- That's good, I guess.
- Well, you bet it is.

01:40.497 --> 01:42.498
They got a ton of success stories.

01:42.533 --> 01:43.934
Well,
I think it's time to hit the road.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.935
But Ty's not even here yet.

01:45.969 --> 01:48.371
We've waited long enough.

01:48.405 --> 01:50.506
Dr. Granger has a lot to do, and so do I.

01:50.541 --> 01:53.008
Hey, you did a great job, kid.

01:53.043 --> 01:54.210
It usually takes a whole wolf pack

01:54.244 --> 01:56.766
to care for a pup 'til he's weaned.

01:56.786 --> 02:00.616
My gut says this fella's got
a good shot at making it now.

02:00.651 --> 02:03.118
Aw... bye, Fang.

02:03.153 --> 02:06.722
Hmm. That's a great name.
I've got a few scars myself.

02:06.756 --> 02:07.861
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too, Bob.

02:07.881 --> 02:09.817
See ya.

02:21.931 --> 02:25.039
So you sure Ty said
he was gonna meet us there?

02:25.074 --> 02:26.040
Positive. I called him back

02:26.075 --> 02:28.009
right before we left for the reserve.

02:28.043 --> 02:30.687
Well, something must have come up.

02:31.345 --> 02:33.548
Maybe he's mad at me because
I got too close to Fang,

02:33.583 --> 02:36.417
and I... I made up all those lame excuses

02:36.451 --> 02:39.008
to get him to come to Heartland
when he didn't want to.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.256
Ty might be going
through a tough time, Georgie,

02:41.290 --> 02:43.224
but he's not the least bit upset with you.

02:43.259 --> 02:45.459
Guaranteed.

02:45.494 --> 02:48.029
Oh, see? I bet that's him right there.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.892
Hello?

02:51.265 --> 02:56.570
Well, if it isn't Dr. Virani.
How you been keeping?

02:57.164 --> 02:58.653
No.

03:00.403 --> 03:03.713
Yeah, of course, Tricia,
I'll head over there right away.

03:04.197 --> 03:06.162
Yeah. No problem. We'll see ya.

03:06.182 --> 03:07.747
What's going on?

03:07.782 --> 03:10.284
Well, it looks like we're
gonna make a bit of a detour.

03:16.124 --> 03:20.627
Oh. Well, I just thought
Georgie would be home by now.

03:20.965 --> 03:23.030
Ah... yeah, I was, I just-

03:23.050 --> 03:26.699
I got... held up with something here.

03:26.734 --> 03:28.795
Could you just tell her that um...

03:28.815 --> 03:31.805
I'm sorry I didn't make it and
that I'll talk to her soon?

03:32.551 --> 03:33.958
Okay.

03:33.978 --> 03:35.752
Thanks, Lou. Bye.

04:20.978 --> 04:23.942
Hey, Scott, what's up?

04:24.910 --> 04:27.925
Just dropping off your final paycheque.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.994
Oh, I was...
I was gonna come by later and get it.

04:30.028 --> 04:32.286
You didn't have to come
all the way out here.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.764
I didn't.

04:33.799 --> 04:36.439
I'm taking this horse to Heartland.

04:38.747 --> 04:40.348
Got it.

04:41.341 --> 04:43.823
So, uh... things are okay?

04:43.947 --> 04:46.843
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

04:47.172 --> 04:48.612
You're looking a little rough.

04:48.646 --> 04:52.782
Uh...
I didn't get much sleep last night, so...

04:52.817 --> 04:56.653
Yeah. Well, I gotta get going.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.289
'kay, well, thanks for dropping this off.

04:59.598 --> 05:01.958
No problem.

05:04.488 --> 05:06.162
We're back!

05:06.196 --> 05:07.864
Grandpa, I'm really glad you're home

05:07.899 --> 05:10.433
because I have a ton of errands to run.

05:10.467 --> 05:13.787
Well, I'm hoping that
you can hold up for a minute.

05:13.924 --> 05:15.363
Come on.

05:19.982 --> 05:23.102
Jade? Didn't I just fire you?

05:23.122 --> 05:25.314
Yeah. Miss me?

05:30.003 --> 05:32.808
S08E06

05:32.828 --> 05:35.861
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:10.276 --> 06:12.627
Oh, Tricia called,
she had to go out of town.

06:12.661 --> 06:15.063
She asked if Jade could
stay here for a few days.

06:15.097 --> 06:17.164
I would've been totally
fine living on my own.

06:17.199 --> 06:19.634
Oh, right. Because you've proven
yourself to be so responsible.

06:19.668 --> 06:22.604
Is somebody gonna clue me
in to what's going on here?

06:22.638 --> 06:25.337
Georgie,
can you please take Jade up to your room?

06:25.357 --> 06:26.340
What?!

06:26.374 --> 06:28.775
I don't wanna hear it.
Especially not from you.

06:29.254 --> 06:30.777
Fine, let's go.

06:31.467 --> 06:34.115
Can I come, too, mama?

06:34.420 --> 06:35.989
Okay, Katie, come on.

06:36.009 --> 06:37.884
Oh, uh, Georgie, Ty called.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.702
He said that, um,
he's sorry he missed you at the reserve,

06:40.722 --> 06:42.774
- and he'll see you soon.
- Okay.

06:42.794 --> 06:44.685
Ty? That's that hot vet, right?

06:44.705 --> 06:47.225
don't be gross!

06:47.709 --> 06:50.563
The dude ranch was a
total mess this morning!

06:50.598 --> 06:53.220
Jade threw a huge party there last night.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.601
Party at the dude ranch?

06:54.636 --> 06:57.737
Yeah. There was a cancellation,
so she knew it was empty.

06:57.757 --> 06:59.372
You gonna tell Tricia about this?

06:59.406 --> 07:02.391
I was planning on telling her
about it today, in person.

07:02.411 --> 07:03.943
Well, too late. She's off to Toronto

07:03.977 --> 07:06.734
to try to patch things up with her husband.

07:06.754 --> 07:09.787
Fine. But if she stays here,
she pulls her own weight.

07:09.807 --> 07:13.445
And I swear to God, grandpa,
if she steps one foot out of line again...

07:13.465 --> 07:18.036
Okay, agreed. Just... go easy on her.

07:18.056 --> 07:20.146
She might even be helpful.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.102
I wouldn't bet on it.

07:39.153 --> 07:40.547
Good morning, Scott!

07:40.567 --> 07:42.173
Hey! Morning, Amy.

07:43.883 --> 07:45.539
A client of mine just bought him.

07:45.559 --> 07:46.918
What's his problem?

07:46.952 --> 07:50.113
He's pretty skittish.
Real struggle just to mount up.

07:50.312 --> 07:51.589
I checked him over.

07:51.623 --> 07:54.325
There doesn't seem to
be any pain or soreness.

07:54.359 --> 07:55.841
Okay. Well, let's get him tacked up

07:55.861 --> 07:57.648
- and see what's going on
- 'kay.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.796
All right, Dash.

08:08.353 --> 08:09.772
Good boy, Dash.

08:13.738 --> 08:15.613
Stand.

08:16.602 --> 08:19.190
Stand.
Hey!

08:19.451 --> 08:21.230
Stand.

08:26.769 --> 08:30.027
Well, he seems okay once you're on.
It's just getting there.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.998
I'm sorry, Amy, I gotta run.

08:35.018 --> 08:37.748
The clinic's been crazy busy these days.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.668
Does that have something to do with Ty?

08:39.703 --> 08:43.039
Yup. Kind of left me in the lurch.

08:43.073 --> 08:44.340
Have you seen him lately?

08:44.374 --> 08:46.985
Yeah, I was just at his place.

08:47.005 --> 08:49.712
'kay, well,
I'll do my best with this guy.

08:49.747 --> 08:51.614
- No promises.
- Thanks, Amy.

08:51.648 --> 08:53.950
I know you'll figure him out.
You always do.

09:00.523 --> 09:02.558
Um... what's all this?

09:02.592 --> 09:04.159
I am going out for a little while

09:04.193 --> 09:05.943
and you are gonna take
care of some things for me

09:05.963 --> 09:08.163
- while I'm gone.
- What kind of things?

09:08.197 --> 09:09.698
Folding the laundry,

09:09.733 --> 09:11.499
uh... cleaning up the living room,

09:11.533 --> 09:13.268
and I've just put Katie down for a nap,

09:13.302 --> 09:14.739
and you're gonna watch her for me.

09:14.759 --> 09:16.211
Right, grandpa?

09:16.231 --> 09:18.506
But-but the kid hardly even knows me.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.399
What if she freaks out when she wakes up?

09:20.419 --> 09:21.743
Why can't Georgie do it?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.979
Georgie is working with Amy.

09:24.013 --> 09:26.120
I'll be around to help out.

09:26.140 --> 09:28.583
- Okay, fine.
- Katie is a light sleeper,

09:28.617 --> 09:30.485
so the less you check up on her,
the better.

09:30.519 --> 09:32.820
You can keep an eye on her with this.

09:32.854 --> 09:35.156
Oh, cool! A nanny-cam.

09:35.190 --> 09:37.224
So what's the going rate for
babysitters in the boonies?

09:37.259 --> 09:39.193
Well, I'm not sure it matters

09:39.227 --> 09:41.234
since you're helping out for free.

09:41.254 --> 09:44.300
I was just kidding.
Get a sense of humour already.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.433
You know what?
You two look like you're gonna have fun.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.368
I will be back as soon as I can.

09:48.403 --> 09:51.420
Bye.

09:51.673 --> 09:55.223
All right.
Well... I'm heading back to the barn.

09:55.243 --> 09:57.377
Wait!
I thought you said you'd be around?

09:57.412 --> 10:00.404
The barn's just across the yard.
You're a smart girl.

10:08.289 --> 10:09.790
You sure it was the poachers?

10:09.824 --> 10:12.559
Well,
they weren't exactly trying to hide it.

10:12.593 --> 10:15.762
And they said they'd be back
if I didn't stop asking questions.

10:15.797 --> 10:17.463
They took their surveillance camera, too.

10:17.497 --> 10:19.899
That sucks, buddy. No doubt about it.

10:19.934 --> 10:21.000
I just don't know how
they knew where I lived.

10:21.035 --> 10:22.768
They knew my name, too.

10:22.803 --> 10:24.003
We've gotta find these guys.

10:24.038 --> 10:26.172
Well, the way I see it, you got off easy.

10:26.207 --> 10:27.740
I'm not afraid of them.

10:27.774 --> 10:29.375
You should be.
I had a run-in with some poachers

10:29.409 --> 10:31.744
a while back and...

10:31.778 --> 10:33.146
Well, what happened?
You take a few hits?

10:33.180 --> 10:35.548
No, man.
They handed me my butt on a platter.

10:35.582 --> 10:37.149
I spent a couple days in the hospital.

10:37.183 --> 10:38.385
And then they threatened
to put me out of business

10:38.405 --> 10:40.152
if I didn't back off.

10:40.186 --> 10:43.615
So I decided to start
keeping a lower profile.

10:44.049 --> 10:46.225
Wait a second. How so?

10:46.259 --> 10:48.761
I report everything to Fish and Wildlife.

10:48.795 --> 10:50.428
Let them put their necks on the line.

10:50.463 --> 10:53.065
Better them than me, right?

10:53.099 --> 10:55.033
So should I call them about last night?

10:55.068 --> 10:58.303
Um, no, those guys know me.
Let me handle it.

11:09.582 --> 11:12.016
When a horse won't stand still,
you have to give him a reason to stop.

11:14.487 --> 11:17.231
Good boy.

11:17.623 --> 11:19.190
So you're trying to tire him out?

11:19.224 --> 11:22.126
Yeah. And keep him focused.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.428
You know, he probably had a bad experience
that stayed with him.

11:24.462 --> 11:25.863
So he needs to get to know me

11:25.898 --> 11:27.598
as much as I need to get to know him.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.400
Then he'll realize I'm not a threat.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.567
Cool.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.037
Cool? How's he doing?

11:33.071 --> 11:35.672
Okay, I guess.

11:35.707 --> 11:37.808
'kay, well, Lou called. She's running late.

11:37.842 --> 11:40.343
I'm heading to Maggie's to pick up dinner.

11:40.378 --> 11:42.413
Now, Katie should be up any time now,

11:42.447 --> 11:44.948
so... can you check in on her?

11:44.982 --> 11:48.228
But I thought Jade was with her?

11:48.836 --> 11:50.703
Gotcha.

11:50.723 --> 11:52.756
Good boy.

12:04.277 --> 12:07.229
Katie?! Where's Jade?

12:07.249 --> 12:08.494
I don't know.

12:08.514 --> 12:10.606
Jade! Jade!

12:10.641 --> 12:12.130
Yeah!

12:12.150 --> 12:13.609
Where were you?

12:13.644 --> 12:16.345
About to crush my personal best score!

12:16.379 --> 12:18.213
Okay, well,
you can't just leave Katie alone like that!

12:18.248 --> 12:19.582
Chill out, kid.

12:19.616 --> 12:21.383
You can do more than one thing at once.

12:21.418 --> 12:23.920
It's called multi-tasking.
Ever heard of it?

12:23.954 --> 12:27.089
The nanny-cam was helping me babysit.

12:27.571 --> 12:30.592
See? I got it covered.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.828
Okay. Whatever.

12:32.862 --> 12:35.183
Here. Come on, Katie.
We're gonna go have a snack.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.270
This place is a disaster!
Look at all this laundry.

12:41.304 --> 12:42.438
Yeah, Lou told me to fold it.

12:42.472 --> 12:45.201
I just... I haven't got around to it yet.

12:45.221 --> 12:46.707
We have to clean
this up before she gets home.

12:46.727 --> 12:48.643
Lou is gonna lose it.

12:48.678 --> 12:50.545
Yeah. Let me just finish this level.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.046
I'm kinda on a roll here.

12:52.081 --> 12:54.015
Jade.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.832
What's the skinny on these guys?

12:59.852 --> 13:03.001
All spayed and neutered.
Procedures went well.

13:03.021 --> 13:04.692
I think they're ready to go.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.560
I guess you oughta be the one to set
'em free.

13:06.595 --> 13:09.297
See them go forth and not multiply.

13:10.734 --> 13:12.638
That's the idea anyway.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.566
Why don't you just take 'em out
beyond the perimeter fence tomorrow?

13:15.586 --> 13:16.570
- You bet.
- All right.

13:16.605 --> 13:19.339
- Well, I'm off.
- Okay.

13:19.374 --> 13:21.809
Oh, hey. There's this um...

13:21.843 --> 13:24.044
little joint just down
the road I always go to.

13:24.078 --> 13:26.914
Thought I might stop off for a couple pops.
You wanna come? My treat.

13:26.948 --> 13:28.482
Uh... yeah, maybe.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.750
Well, you've had a rough night.

13:29.784 --> 13:32.660
- I mean, might be just what you need.
- Uh...

13:32.680 --> 13:34.323
But hey, like,
don't let me hold you back,

13:34.343 --> 13:35.427
if you got somewhere you gotta be.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.458
No, no, I don't. I just got some stuff
I gotta... I gotta finish up first,

13:38.493 --> 13:39.893
but I'll see you there later maybe.

13:39.927 --> 13:41.961
All right, buddy. Don't stay too late.

14:04.585 --> 14:07.164
Dinner rocks. My mom never cooks.

14:07.184 --> 14:11.290
Well, I can't take the credit.
It's leftovers from Maggie's.

14:11.594 --> 14:13.762
Have you heard from your mom?

14:13.782 --> 14:17.328
Nah. She's too busy wasting
her time in Toronto to care about me.

14:17.348 --> 14:19.885
She's trying to give my dad space.

14:19.905 --> 14:22.168
Bad idea. It totally backfired.

14:22.202 --> 14:24.070
He got himself a stupid new
girlfriend and moved on.

14:25.987 --> 14:27.005
Well, I have to admit.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.615
I was pleasantly surprised
by everything you did today.

14:32.614 --> 14:35.085
Well, uh... Georgie pitched in, too.

14:35.105 --> 14:36.785
Pitched in?

14:36.805 --> 14:39.428
More like I did everything myself!

14:39.448 --> 14:40.942
I babysat, I set the table,

14:40.962 --> 14:43.555
I picked up toys. I did laundry!

14:43.589 --> 14:45.870
I was going to help,
but you did it all so fast

14:45.890 --> 14:46.891
I didn't have a chance!

14:46.925 --> 14:49.094
That's 'cause you were playing
your stupid video game.

14:49.128 --> 14:50.660
Okay, you know what?
I knew this wasn't going to work.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.542
- Oh, come on!
- All right, that's enough!

14:53.562 --> 14:55.700
Jade, since you're not so interested
in helping out around here,

14:55.734 --> 14:57.369
I've got something else you can do.

14:57.389 --> 14:59.218
Well,
she's not going near the dude ranch again.

14:59.238 --> 15:00.756
As of tomorrow morning,

15:00.776 --> 15:04.408
Jade is going to be
Heartland's new ranch hand.

15:04.442 --> 15:06.589
No way! I don't even like horses!

15:06.609 --> 15:09.753
Too bad. You bunk here, you pitch in.

15:09.773 --> 15:11.634
Simple as that.

15:16.824 --> 15:18.673
I am trying to focus on work right now.

15:18.704 --> 15:21.405
The last thing I need is someone
who clearly isn't into it.

15:21.439 --> 15:24.441
Well, you know,
I remember it wasn't all that long ago

15:24.476 --> 15:26.511
you helped turn another reluctant recruit

15:26.545 --> 15:28.990
into a fairly decent ranch hand.

15:29.010 --> 15:30.554
That was mostly you,

15:30.574 --> 15:33.209
and besides, it was different with Ty.

15:33.229 --> 15:35.720
Well, in some ways it was, yes,

15:35.754 --> 15:38.703
but, in the important ways,
it was the very same.

15:38.723 --> 15:40.256
No. I'm-I'm with Amy.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.525
That's two strikes, and I just-

15:41.559 --> 15:43.026
I don't think this is a good idea.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.395
I just think it could
be just what Jade needs.

15:45.429 --> 15:48.331
And what about what I need?

15:48.553 --> 15:50.506
I'm gonna go do night check.

15:52.966 --> 15:55.704
Georgie, you need to be part of this too.

15:55.739 --> 15:57.206
Not sure how I can help.

15:57.241 --> 16:00.876
Well, step up and you show Jade the ropes.

16:00.911 --> 16:04.428
So I'd be... kind of like her boss?

16:05.545 --> 16:08.550
Well, I guess that's one way to look at it.

16:21.031 --> 16:23.165
Where's my stupid phone?!

16:23.199 --> 16:25.281
You are evil.

16:25.301 --> 16:28.903
Come on! You've hit snooze
like a thousand times already.

16:28.938 --> 16:30.505
I just need a couple more minutes.

16:30.540 --> 16:31.973
Get up now, or else I'll be back

16:32.007 --> 16:34.496
with a bucket of ice cold water.

16:34.516 --> 16:35.843
You wouldn't dare.

16:35.878 --> 16:39.381
Come on! We have to go! Jack is waiting.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.684
See, thing is, kid...
I don't do mornings.

16:42.718 --> 16:45.375
You know what?
You do now.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.055
So get up!

16:48.356 --> 16:51.521
- Hey! Hey! Stop it!
- Get up!

16:54.296 --> 16:57.448
Ugh! How do you stand it?

16:57.468 --> 16:59.433
I'd lose my mind if I
had to do this everyday.

16:59.468 --> 17:00.934
I think it's fun.

17:02.337 --> 17:05.005
Ugh! It's making my clothes reek.

17:05.039 --> 17:06.746
And it's totally ruining my boots.

17:06.766 --> 17:08.842
Guess you're getting the hang of it then.

17:08.876 --> 17:11.286
Well, it's not exactly rocket science.

17:11.306 --> 17:15.015
Uh, Georgie, why don't you go see if
Amy needs some help with that new horse.

17:15.049 --> 17:17.951
Gladly.

17:17.986 --> 17:20.185
Well, that was fun.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.589
Yeah, I'm uh... heading into town.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.457
I expect you'll be done
by the time I get back.

17:24.492 --> 17:26.192
You're kidding, right?

17:26.227 --> 17:28.762
I can't do anymore; My hand hurts.

17:28.796 --> 17:31.164
I think I'm getting a blister.

17:31.198 --> 17:34.100
I guess... you'll need these then,

17:34.135 --> 17:36.369
seeing as you still got a ways to go.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.372
So I have to do all this on my own?

17:39.406 --> 17:41.741
Well, that's the great thing
about living on a ranch.

17:41.775 --> 17:44.982
The fun just never ends.

17:54.487 --> 17:57.823
Good boy, Dash.

17:57.858 --> 18:01.093
Okay, I think he's ready
to give this another try.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.831
Good boy. Whoa... stand.

18:06.866 --> 18:09.168
Stand.

18:09.202 --> 18:11.239
Hey. Hey.

18:16.548 --> 18:18.243
Hey, hey, hey.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.095
Stand.

18:31.309 --> 18:32.523
What's his deal?

18:32.558 --> 18:34.932
He has a problem with standing still.

18:35.329 --> 18:38.687
Well, aren't horses supposed to move?
Isn't that the whole point?

18:38.707 --> 18:40.665
Have you ever tried to get
on a horse that won't stand still?

18:40.699 --> 18:43.834
Hardly.
I stay as far away from them as I can.

18:43.868 --> 18:46.136
Well,
a horse's natural instinct is to flee

18:46.171 --> 18:48.105
if it feels threatened or anxious.

18:48.139 --> 18:50.408
Makes sense. Probably feels a lot safer

18:50.442 --> 18:52.142
than just sticking around
to see what happens.

18:52.177 --> 18:53.811
That's exactly what he's thinking.

18:53.845 --> 18:56.046
For someone that doesn't like horses,

18:56.081 --> 18:58.594
you seem pretty interested.

18:58.614 --> 19:00.684
Well, I guess I'd better
go finish cleaning the stalls

19:00.719 --> 19:02.319
before Jack gets back.

19:02.353 --> 19:04.454
Don't want him to have a meltdown.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.138
All right. Doors are open.

20:03.378 --> 20:05.042
Damn.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.267
Good boy. You're okay.

20:18.538 --> 20:20.824
Whoa. Relax. Ho, there.

20:29.348 --> 20:31.116
Good boy.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.568
He's doing it!

20:32.588 --> 20:34.586
Good boy!

20:34.606 --> 20:37.304
That's what we want.

20:37.324 --> 20:39.892
Let's try that again.

20:39.926 --> 20:42.060
Stand.

20:45.324 --> 20:47.607
Good boy, Dash.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.301
That's great!

20:50.321 --> 20:53.341
All right.
Well, I say we call it quits for today.

20:53.361 --> 20:55.474
All right.
Jade and I will go untack him.

20:55.508 --> 20:58.244
Jade doesn't seem too keen on horses,
Georgie.

20:58.278 --> 21:00.010
She just needs to
get used to being around them.

21:00.030 --> 21:01.847
Well, don't push it, okay?

21:01.881 --> 21:03.545
People have to come into
it in their own time,

21:03.565 --> 21:05.550
and some just never do.

21:05.584 --> 21:07.689
That's why I'm gonna show
her exactly what she's missing.

21:53.898 --> 21:56.266
So once you're done
loosening all the dust and dirt,

21:56.300 --> 21:58.501
then you can brush it out like this.

21:58.535 --> 22:00.270
Why are you even showing me this?

22:00.304 --> 22:02.071
Because it's part of being a ranch hand.

22:02.106 --> 22:04.658
Who cares? I didn't sign up for this!

22:04.678 --> 22:06.644
I can't believe my mom's
making me stay here.

22:06.664 --> 22:08.542
She's just worried about you.

22:08.562 --> 22:10.391
Yeah, well, she should stop meddling.

22:10.411 --> 22:12.749
You know, I can take care of myself.

22:12.769 --> 22:15.150
Look, I've had some
people not care about me at all.

22:15.185 --> 22:18.821
It's way better to have someone
worry about you, trust me.

22:19.443 --> 22:20.788
And since you're stuck here,

22:20.808 --> 22:23.854
you might as well take some
time to bond with the horse.

22:23.874 --> 22:25.027
I don't think so.

22:25.061 --> 22:28.163
Jack probably has like a
million more chores for me.

22:28.198 --> 22:30.274
Actually, I already talked to
him and he says it was okay.

22:32.647 --> 22:35.226
What is he doing? Make him stop!

22:35.246 --> 22:37.158
It's nothing to freak out about.

22:37.178 --> 22:38.610
I'm not freaking out.

22:38.630 --> 22:40.909
It just means he likes you.

22:41.906 --> 22:45.579
Hey? Good boy.

22:45.613 --> 22:47.148
Wow. He really likes carrots.

22:47.182 --> 22:49.350
Yeah. All right.

22:49.384 --> 22:51.852
I'm gonna go grab copper and tack him up.

22:51.886 --> 22:53.988
You can take Dash back to his stall.

22:54.022 --> 22:55.620
I don't think so.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.159
And you need to stop pushing all
this horse stuff on me, okay?

22:58.193 --> 23:00.494
It's bad enough I'm stuck
raking up all their poo!

23:00.528 --> 23:01.328
Look,
if you're gonna be a ranch hand,

23:01.362 --> 23:03.263
you got to learn to ride.

23:03.297 --> 23:05.799
Ride? Ugh! Yeah, you're kidding, right?

23:05.834 --> 23:08.301
Nope, and I'm gonna teach you.

23:08.336 --> 23:09.603
Jack thinks it's a good idea, too.

23:09.637 --> 23:11.338
So, if you have a problem with it,

23:11.372 --> 23:13.035
you can go talk to him.

23:16.932 --> 23:18.278
This is so not fair.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.742
Come on. Come on.

23:38.039 --> 23:39.632
The bear was a sow.

23:39.666 --> 23:41.333
Those cubs probably belonged to her.

23:41.368 --> 23:43.002
That sucks.

23:43.036 --> 23:44.804
The cubs have gotta be six
or seven months old now,

23:44.838 --> 23:46.806
so at least they can survive on their own.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.875
I think you're missing the point.

23:48.909 --> 23:50.675
They've already killed
two bears that we know of.

23:50.710 --> 23:53.425
Fish and Wildlife is working on it.
It just takes time.

23:53.445 --> 23:55.881
It's hard for them to make
headway without new info.

23:55.915 --> 23:58.017
Bob, those orphaned cubs are on us.

23:58.051 --> 24:00.852
Look, I get that you're upset, buddy.
So am I.

24:00.887 --> 24:02.287
Well, I'm not just gonna
sit around and wait, okay?

24:02.322 --> 24:03.788
I'm gonna try and stop them.

24:03.823 --> 24:05.524
Look, you just don't get it, do you?

24:05.558 --> 24:07.191
What if these are same
poachers that I dealt with

24:07.226 --> 24:08.627
and now you're on their radar,

24:08.661 --> 24:11.596
which means so am I and my reserve.

24:11.631 --> 24:13.798
I mean... these guys are dangerous.

24:13.833 --> 24:15.299
What're they gonna do
when push comes to shove?

24:15.334 --> 24:17.235
They're gonna come right after us!

24:17.269 --> 24:20.005
This isn't just about bears, Ty!

24:20.039 --> 24:23.274
Got all these other animals to worry about.

24:23.308 --> 24:26.110
Why don't you do me a favour
and take the day off tomorrow.

24:26.145 --> 24:27.545
- What're you talking about?
- Take the day off

24:27.579 --> 24:30.165
and go and get your head
straight around this.

24:30.185 --> 24:31.682
Grow up!

24:39.058 --> 24:41.258
This is gonna give me hat head.

24:41.292 --> 24:42.960
Okay, well, get over it.

24:42.994 --> 24:45.429
Beginners have to wear a helmet.
Those are the rules.

24:45.463 --> 24:46.564
don't worry, Jade.
We'll be right here.

24:46.598 --> 24:47.932
There's nothing to be afraid of.

24:47.966 --> 24:50.133
I'm not! don't you get it?
I just don't wanna do this.

24:51.603 --> 24:53.537
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:53.572 --> 24:54.905
Dash!

24:57.442 --> 24:59.943
Whoa... Dash. Whoa, buddy.

24:59.977 --> 25:02.245
It's okay. Stand!

25:02.280 --> 25:04.081
How did this happen?

25:04.115 --> 25:05.449
Well, don't look at me.

25:05.483 --> 25:07.041
Jade was the one who put him in his stall!

25:07.061 --> 25:08.785
How is this my fault?

25:08.819 --> 25:11.272
You have to check that
the stall door is latched.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.489
I did!

25:12.523 --> 25:13.690
Well,
you obviously didn't check close enough.

25:13.724 --> 25:15.491
This is a client's horse, Jade,

25:15.525 --> 25:17.229
and I'm responsible if
anything happens to him!

25:17.249 --> 25:20.257
I get it, okay?
But I didn't do anything wrong!

25:20.277 --> 25:22.765
Thanks for having my back.

25:25.535 --> 25:27.336
Yes, but the horse is fine.

25:27.370 --> 25:28.705
Can't you cut her a little slack?

25:28.739 --> 25:32.295
I just don't think that Jade
is taking this ranch work seriously enough.

25:32.315 --> 25:35.144
Well, she hardly ate anything.
She's obviously upset.

25:35.178 --> 25:36.812
Someone should talk to her.

25:36.846 --> 25:39.264
don't you look at me.

25:39.284 --> 25:40.949
I already tried.

25:40.984 --> 25:44.761
Besides, I'm not the one who thought
that this was a good idea.

25:48.057 --> 25:50.993
- She's got a lot on her mind.
- She has a point.

25:51.027 --> 25:54.129
I am the one who thought
this might be a good idea.

25:54.163 --> 25:56.431
- That's true.
- But...

25:56.465 --> 25:59.620
I'm not giving up on her. Not just yet.

26:09.545 --> 26:13.515
Saw your truck outside.
You're here pretty late.

26:13.549 --> 26:16.784
Well, I am a bit short-staffed these days.

26:16.818 --> 26:20.549
Look, Scott, the only reason I came by
is 'cause I could use your help.

26:20.569 --> 26:22.623
For real?

26:22.658 --> 26:25.140
You leave me high and dry
and now you want my help?

26:27.456 --> 26:29.075
Okay. Forget it.

26:29.095 --> 26:31.872
I was just wondering if you had any
connections with Fish and Wildlife.

26:31.892 --> 26:34.213
Why you wanna know?

26:35.168 --> 26:39.031
Because I found two dead bears.
Both killed with crossbows.

26:39.051 --> 26:40.458
Both females.

26:40.478 --> 26:41.908
Where?

26:47.812 --> 26:50.850
One here...
and today, a new mother right here.

26:50.885 --> 26:53.276
Both had their gallbladders removed.

26:53.573 --> 26:55.288
Poachers.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.523
Sounds like they were being baited.

26:57.558 --> 27:00.737
Yeah.
I found her orphaned cubs hanging around.

27:01.196 --> 27:02.796
That's too bad.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.937
The thing is, Scott,
Bob called Fish and Wildlife,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.833
but they don't seem to be doing much.

27:06.867 --> 27:09.019
So I thought if you knew
someone there that...

27:09.039 --> 27:11.571
- I dunno, maybe you could help.
- I'm afraid not.

27:11.605 --> 27:13.872
Well, it was worth a shot.

27:13.907 --> 27:16.909
I guess I'll try and track down
their baiting stations myself.

27:16.943 --> 27:19.945
If you're smart,
you'll let Fish and Wildlife handle it.

27:19.979 --> 27:21.808
So, in the meantime,
I'm supposed to let these guys

27:21.828 --> 27:24.550
kill as many bears as they'd like?

27:25.179 --> 27:26.908
I don't think so.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.364
So you were pretty quiet during dinner.

27:41.872 --> 27:42.914
Hey!

27:45.070 --> 27:47.272
I said, you were pretty quiet at dinner.

27:47.306 --> 27:49.843
Just trying to stay out of trouble.

27:49.863 --> 27:53.578
Look, Jade, everyone makes mistakes.

27:53.613 --> 27:56.715
What matters is how you
choose to handle it.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.616
Meaning?

27:58.650 --> 28:02.041
Well, meaning...
Georgie could use a hand doing night check.

28:02.061 --> 28:03.661
I think I'll take a pass.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.957
Well, it's not up to you.

28:05.991 --> 28:08.786
Besides,
sitting here feeling sorry for yourself

28:08.806 --> 28:10.762
sure won't solve anything.

28:10.796 --> 28:12.797
You know, it might even make you feel good.

28:12.831 --> 28:15.862
I seriously doubt that.

28:16.941 --> 28:19.002
You ask me? It's too bad

28:19.036 --> 28:21.505
when people get so worried
about making mistakes,

28:21.539 --> 28:24.518
that they quit trying altogether.

28:34.572 --> 28:35.986
Hey!

28:36.719 --> 28:38.431
Here. Let me.

28:40.045 --> 28:41.658
Look, I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

28:41.692 --> 28:44.494
I was supposed to be supervising.

28:44.528 --> 28:46.763
Well, I guess it makes it your fault, then.

28:47.178 --> 28:49.299
How about... it's both our faults.

28:49.333 --> 28:52.452
Okay. I can live with that.

28:52.903 --> 28:57.012
You know, he likes you. You should pet him.

28:59.209 --> 29:01.919
It's okay.
Look it, his ears are pointing towards you;

29:01.939 --> 29:04.247
that means he wants you to.

29:09.619 --> 29:12.753
You know,
you should really change your story.

29:12.773 --> 29:13.952
Which one?

29:13.972 --> 29:16.158
About not liking horses.

29:16.193 --> 29:20.709
The truth is...
they do kind of scare me... a little bit.

29:22.062 --> 29:24.333
But there's something about this guy.

29:29.772 --> 29:32.859
You know...
I can help you get over your fear,

29:32.879 --> 29:34.460
if you want me to.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.766
There you go. I'll get you your snack.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.620
Morning!

29:46.655 --> 29:48.356
Good morning. Where are you off to?

29:48.390 --> 29:51.689
Oh, Katie has gymboree.
I'm gonna pop into Maggie's.

29:51.709 --> 29:53.488
But we'll be back soon, right?

29:53.508 --> 29:55.162
Yup!

29:55.196 --> 29:57.596
So how's it going with that new horse?

29:57.616 --> 30:00.066
Pretty good.
I'm happy with the way he's responding.

30:00.086 --> 30:02.250
I think we're getting close.

30:02.270 --> 30:04.124
- Well, I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.976
Oh no!

30:11.579 --> 30:14.590
It looks like he's long gone.

30:17.121 --> 30:18.818
- What's wrong?
- Dash is missing.

30:18.853 --> 30:21.127
You forgot to check the stall door again?

30:21.147 --> 30:24.224
- Hey! I'm not stupid!
- Tone it down.

30:24.795 --> 30:26.193
I double checked this time.

30:26.227 --> 30:27.994
Looking after horses
isn't for everyone, okay?

30:28.028 --> 30:30.325
And maybe you're just not up to it?

30:30.345 --> 30:33.080
It wasn't Jade's fault!
We double-checked the latch.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.233
It was fine when we left him.

30:34.268 --> 30:37.679
Then how do you explain
this disappearing act?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.272
We can't.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.160
That's not good enough.

30:53.023 --> 30:54.549
Got your message.

30:54.569 --> 30:55.678
What's up?

30:55.703 --> 30:58.389
Well, I thought about what you said.

30:58.409 --> 31:00.440
But if I'm gonna get involved,

31:00.474 --> 31:02.716
I wanna check this area out for myself.

31:02.736 --> 31:03.976
No, no, no.

31:04.010 --> 31:07.513
Thanks for the offer, but I got it.
It'll be fine.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.649
No, it won't.

31:09.871 --> 31:12.385
I know you're too stubborn to drop it.

31:12.868 --> 31:15.094
But I don't have a lot of time.

31:15.114 --> 31:17.604
So when can you do this?

31:17.624 --> 31:20.792
Well, I uh... I got the day off.

31:20.827 --> 31:23.929
All right. I'll get Cass to cover.

31:23.964 --> 31:26.731
But I can only spare a couple hours.

31:26.766 --> 31:28.267
Come on, grandpa.

31:28.301 --> 31:29.901
Losing a client's horse, that's a big deal.

31:29.936 --> 31:31.470
That is true,

31:31.504 --> 31:34.946
but we're not really
sure how it happened yet,

31:34.966 --> 31:39.878
and seems to me that you've been...
overreacting

31:39.912 --> 31:42.514
to pretty much everything these days.

31:45.121 --> 31:50.489
Amy, I swore I was gonna stay
out of things from here on out,

31:50.523 --> 31:53.519
but I know from experience
that it can be good

31:53.539 --> 31:57.628
when two people take the time and
space from each other that they need.

31:58.111 --> 32:00.431
Look at me and Lisa.

32:00.466 --> 32:04.302
The time we spent apart after
my heart attack, that was good.

32:04.336 --> 32:07.638
But there's also such a thing
as taking too much time.

32:07.672 --> 32:10.055
I've tried talking to Ty, okay?

32:10.075 --> 32:11.642
It just never works.

32:11.676 --> 32:15.479
Amy, if you want things to change,
you gotta keep trying.

32:17.081 --> 32:19.116
There he is right there.

32:19.150 --> 32:21.282
Do you mind watching Spartan?

32:21.302 --> 32:22.820
Sure.

32:27.458 --> 32:29.493
Well, we're about to
see if he's learned anything.

32:29.527 --> 32:34.176
Hey, boy. Stand.

32:35.777 --> 32:38.701
Whoa... stand.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.474
Good boy. Huh?

32:42.926 --> 32:44.974
You had us worried.

32:45.358 --> 32:47.243
Come on, let's go home.

32:47.277 --> 32:48.845
Looks like you fixed him.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.127
Yeah, not bad, huh?

32:56.086 --> 32:57.933
Yeah,
stop anywhere along here and we'll walk in.

32:57.953 --> 32:59.566
Okay.

33:08.998 --> 33:10.699
You sure we need a tranq gun?

33:10.733 --> 33:13.536
Just a precaution.
Bears are food-driven.

33:13.570 --> 33:15.470
If they find a reliable source,
chances are they'll be back.

33:15.504 --> 33:17.039
All right.

33:17.073 --> 33:20.812
I found both dead bears
in this general area.

33:25.813 --> 33:27.290
Look!

33:33.066 --> 33:34.200
Is he okay?

33:34.220 --> 33:37.099
Oh, he seems to be just fine.

33:38.340 --> 33:39.704
I'll take him.

33:40.762 --> 33:43.631
Girls? I was pretty upset before.

33:43.665 --> 33:46.058
But now that I've had a chance to cool off,

33:46.078 --> 33:47.735
I've gotta ask you again,

33:47.769 --> 33:50.016
do you have any idea how this happened?

33:50.036 --> 33:52.035
No. None. Sorry.

33:52.055 --> 33:54.374
We've gotta find out though.

33:58.113 --> 34:00.399
The bear cubs ran off into those woods.

34:00.419 --> 34:02.382
Probably a good place to start.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.952
Poachers usually monitor
a few baiting stations at once.

34:06.596 --> 34:08.655
There's the ground blind.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.062
There's the bait.

34:12.465 --> 34:14.616
Looks like stale donuts and cookies.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.428
Makes sense.

34:16.447 --> 34:18.897
Bears usually have a sweet tooth.

34:27.844 --> 34:29.275
This is lame.

34:29.309 --> 34:31.987
He's not doing anything,
he's just standing there.

34:32.713 --> 34:33.947
How long are we gonna keep doing this?

34:33.981 --> 34:35.547
As long as it takes.

34:35.581 --> 34:36.850
What if there's nothing to see?

34:36.884 --> 34:38.618
Maybe I didn't latch the stall door.

34:38.652 --> 34:41.355
I saw you check it, remember?

34:45.998 --> 34:47.884
Look!

34:48.938 --> 34:51.264
No way! That is messed up.

34:51.297 --> 34:54.231
Amy and Jack will never believe this!

34:56.924 --> 34:58.971
Maybe we can show them.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.074
What do you think?

35:02.108 --> 35:04.821
Call Fish and Wildlife,
let 'em take it from here?

35:04.841 --> 35:06.779
Yeah, we'll call.

35:26.832 --> 35:28.934
I know those guys.

35:28.954 --> 35:31.069
They paid me a visit.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.806
It's time for a little payback.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.777
Hey!

35:40.340 --> 35:41.983
Don't do anything stupid.

35:42.003 --> 35:44.081
But I guess it's too late for that, huh?

35:46.421 --> 35:48.175
Careful, Ty!

35:50.764 --> 35:52.059
Hey, you're not so fast!

35:53.767 --> 35:56.360
Stay down!

35:56.604 --> 35:59.949
- Okay, okay. Take it easy!
- Nice try.

36:00.098 --> 36:03.871
Why spend your day off sticking
your nose where it don't belong?

36:06.431 --> 36:08.670
I told you to leave it alone, man.

36:08.690 --> 36:10.730
You told them my name, Bob!

36:10.750 --> 36:13.543
That I had the day off. Where I lived!

36:13.577 --> 36:15.779
You knew they were coming
after me and you let it happen!

36:15.813 --> 36:18.405
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do understand!

36:18.425 --> 36:20.303
You've been lying to me from the start!

36:20.323 --> 36:22.252
About everything!

36:22.286 --> 36:25.515
Okay, yeah, the poachers threw
some money my way and I took it.

36:25.535 --> 36:28.571
Now that may sound bad to you,
but I have been busting my butt off

36:28.591 --> 36:30.618
just trying to keep this place open!

36:30.638 --> 36:32.244
I did it for the greater good.

36:32.264 --> 36:36.260
Oh, don't kid yourself.
You're no better than they are.

36:36.657 --> 36:38.061
I'm not proud of it,

36:38.081 --> 36:40.683
but I did what I had to do to survive.

36:40.703 --> 36:42.737
And yeah, a few bears died,

36:42.772 --> 36:45.172
but look at all the other
animals that got to live.

36:45.192 --> 36:47.109
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

36:47.143 --> 36:50.879
Tell it to Fish and Wildlife,
and good luck with that.

36:51.478 --> 36:53.364
Ty, wait!

36:58.780 --> 37:00.745
What do you got going on in here then?

37:00.765 --> 37:03.123
Wait till you see this!

37:05.193 --> 37:07.561
Prepare to have your minds blown.

37:07.596 --> 37:09.563
Consider us warned.

37:12.033 --> 37:13.366
Come on, Dash! Come to the carrot!

37:13.401 --> 37:14.701
- Come on!
- Come on, boy!

37:14.735 --> 37:16.002
- Come on, Dash! Come!
- Dash, come on!

37:16.036 --> 37:17.304
Come get it!

37:17.338 --> 37:19.005
- Come on!
- You can do it!

37:19.039 --> 37:19.772
You love carrots.

37:19.807 --> 37:21.774
Come on, I know you do! Come on!

37:21.809 --> 37:23.477
- Come get it!
- Good boy!

37:23.511 --> 37:24.611
- You got it! You got it!
- Come on!

37:24.645 --> 37:26.679
- You can do it!
- What's that?

37:26.714 --> 37:29.248
- Good boy!
- Wait, almost... Almost there!

37:29.282 --> 37:30.617
- Wait, almost...
- Come on, you almost got it!

37:32.185 --> 37:33.653
Good boy, Dash!

37:33.687 --> 37:35.221
Good boy! Come here! Come get it!

37:35.255 --> 37:37.256
Oh, good boy!

37:37.290 --> 37:39.058
That's crazy!

37:39.093 --> 37:40.860
I've never seen anything like it.

37:40.894 --> 37:42.595
How did you guys figure this out?

37:42.630 --> 37:45.297
Well,
we spied on him with Katie's nanny-cam.

37:45.332 --> 37:47.065
But we wanted you guys to see it in person.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.834
So Jade came up with the carrot idea.

37:48.868 --> 37:51.337
Well, I better rig something up quick

37:51.371 --> 37:53.639
before he decides to drive the tractor.

37:57.344 --> 38:00.112
I guess I owe you two an apology.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.280
This time I'm the one
who jumped to conclusions

38:02.314 --> 38:05.908
and sorry I was so quick to blame.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.388
Good boy, Dash.

38:19.866 --> 38:22.228
Now for your final test.

38:23.743 --> 38:25.744
He's doing it!

38:27.380 --> 38:29.014
You're such a good boy.

38:37.556 --> 38:39.015
That's it.

38:39.035 --> 38:40.888
Do you wanna give it a try?

38:40.908 --> 38:43.134
Come on, you can do this.

38:49.276 --> 38:51.745
I can't believe I'm
getting sucked into this.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.922
Just put your left foot in there

38:53.942 --> 38:56.274
and swing your right leg over.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.871
There you go!

38:59.891 --> 39:02.609
Okay, now hang onto your reins.

39:03.316 --> 39:05.249
How do you feel?

39:09.221 --> 39:11.222
- Good job!
- Nice!

39:11.256 --> 39:12.990
Take him forward!

39:13.025 --> 39:15.559
Come on, Dash.

39:22.062 --> 39:23.712
Hey, Scott?!

39:29.225 --> 39:31.508
Hey. Sorry to hear about Bob.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.744
Thought he was a decent guy.

39:33.778 --> 39:36.713
Yeah, I thought so too.

39:36.748 --> 39:41.217
But he made some stupid decisions
and now he's gotta deal with the fallout.

39:42.153 --> 39:44.187
Look, I... I gotta say,

39:44.221 --> 39:48.240
I really appreciate you stepping up
and helping me out.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.693
It was great to work with you again.

39:53.097 --> 39:55.934
Look, I know a lot was said,

39:55.954 --> 39:58.154
but this is one of the
best jobs I've ever had.

39:58.174 --> 40:01.939
I have to admit, it hasn't been
the same around here without you.

40:01.959 --> 40:05.908
Thanks, man. I... I appreciate that.

40:09.003 --> 40:13.583
You know what, Scott?
I... I totally blew it.

40:13.603 --> 40:14.923
You've got a business here to run

40:14.943 --> 40:16.786
and I didn't handle that
Dr. Kerr thing very well,

40:16.820 --> 40:19.504
and I see that now.

40:19.524 --> 40:22.830
Is there any way you'd ever
consider hiring me back on?

40:22.850 --> 40:24.977
The thing about you, Ty,

40:24.997 --> 40:29.498
is you always put the
welfare of the animals first.

40:29.532 --> 40:31.766
Which is one of the qualities

40:31.801 --> 40:34.103
that's gonna make you a great vet someday.

40:34.137 --> 40:35.621
And just so you know,

40:35.641 --> 40:38.206
I walked away from the Dr. Kerr deal.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.303
So what're you saying?

40:44.436 --> 40:46.481
Welcome back.

40:46.516 --> 40:48.383
Are you serious?

40:49.819 --> 40:51.752
Thanks, man. You won't regret it.

40:51.772 --> 40:53.671
Don't thank me yet.

40:53.691 --> 40:56.024
Cassandra's really picked up
the slack since you've been gone

40:56.058 --> 40:58.759
so... she's the boss now.

40:58.793 --> 41:00.215
That's fine.

41:00.235 --> 41:02.997
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'm just happy to be back.

41:03.032 --> 41:05.033
See you in the morning, Ty.

41:05.067 --> 41:06.991
You bet.

41:16.110 --> 41:18.078
Wait. I wanna give him this.

41:18.112 --> 41:20.113
Here you go, boy.

41:22.150 --> 41:25.280
Okay, girls, time for him to go.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.789
Come on, Dash.

41:29.823 --> 41:32.859
Good boy.

41:46.506 --> 41:48.640
It sucks saying goodbye.

41:49.149 --> 41:51.310
That's how it is in the animal business.

41:51.344 --> 41:53.529
We try not to get too attached.

41:55.937 --> 41:58.997
And I wish I could tell you it gets easier,
but it doesn't.

42:13.300 --> 42:16.334
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:16.766 --> 42:18.169
Where you headed?

42:18.918 --> 42:21.306
I'm... returning this horse to Scott.

42:21.340 --> 42:24.316
- I guess he must be pretty busy.
- Yeah.

42:24.336 --> 42:26.641
Hopefully I can help with that now.

42:26.661 --> 42:28.814
What do you mean?

42:28.848 --> 42:30.982
Well, I just got my old job back.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.099
That's great!

42:33.620 --> 42:36.889
- What about that reserve?
- I quit.

42:37.584 --> 42:40.537
It's kind of a long story. Um...

42:46.876 --> 42:49.669
- I should get going.
- Ty?

42:52.983 --> 42:55.471
I miss you.

42:55.847 --> 42:58.407
Take care of yourself.

43:25.786 --> 43:27.127
On the next Heartland...

43:27.147 --> 43:29.206
My brother thinks there's
something wrong with the horses.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.582
Too much horse to handle.

43:30.602 --> 43:31.175
Pull back!

43:31.177 --> 43:33.010
When horse
whispering isn't the answer.

43:33.012 --> 43:33.877
You're such a liar!

43:33.879 --> 43:34.979
A plot is a foot.

43:34.981 --> 43:36.080
He's going to sell them.

43:36.082 --> 43:37.081
We have to stop him.

43:37.083 --> 43:40.912
An all new Heartland,
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC.
