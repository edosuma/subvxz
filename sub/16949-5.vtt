Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.505 --> 00:07.374
{\an7}So, she came all
the way from Chicago

00:07.440 --> 00:08.508
{\an7}to show me some
text messages

00:08.575 --> 00:09.909
{\an7}and ain't seen you
since 2004.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.010
{\an8}She hasn't seen me
since 2004.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.513
{\an8}It don't (bleep)
make sense to me.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.014
{\an7}All we wanna know
is the truth at this point.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.116
{\an8}Why are you here?

00:16.181 --> 00:17.650
{\an8}I was still
in love with you!

00:17.717 --> 00:19.252
{\an7}(bleep)

00:19.319 --> 00:20.286
{\an8}Will you allow me
to make it better?

00:20.353 --> 00:21.821
{\an7}Now it's time
to think about me.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.123
{\an7}I'm gonna get
my ass in the studio.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.358
{\an7}When I need you to watch,
you'll watch the kids.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.727
{\an8}I need to do that for myself.

00:27.794 --> 00:31.131
{\an8}You're, like, the most beautiful
person I've ever met in my life.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.732
{\an8}That is so sweet of you.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.567
{\an7}(Nikki)
I'm talking to somebody.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.567
{\an6}Fizz?

00:34.634 --> 00:35.602
{\an7}No.

00:34.634 --> 00:35.602
{\an9}Who?

00:35.668 --> 00:37.370
{\an7}I'm actually talking
to two people.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.939
{\an7}Just make sure that you tell me
what's going on with you.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.508
{\an8}(Nikki)
I don't feel like I give
you a reason to worry.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.410
{\an7}(Rosa)
Not yet.

00:43.476 --> 00:44.444
{\an9}Do I?

00:45.979 --> 00:47.313
{\an8}I want there to be peace,

00:47.380 --> 00:49.082
{\an7}and I want you guys
to be able to get along.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.185
{\an7}I feel like you should
reach out to Pam.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.053
{\an7}So, have you started
looking for a place yet?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.889
{\an8}Gonna have to realize
that I'm here.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.791
{\an8}Arguing back and forth
is gonna lead to blows.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.860
{\an8}All you gotta do is
pull my button one time.

01:00.927 --> 01:02.729
{\an8}I upgraded the ring.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.997
{\an9}Ooh...

01:04.063 --> 01:06.466
{\an8}I know you trying
to show Ma stand down.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.867
{\an7}Yeah.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.503
{\an8}My toast is to Pam finally
getting the hell out.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.671
{\an8}You in your own house.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.106
{\an7}You ain't got nothing
to do with it.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.507
{\an8}Don't do that.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.507
{\an8}(bleep)!

01:14.574 --> 01:15.775
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

01:15.842 --> 01:16.810
{\an8}You know I do that--

01:15.842 --> 01:16.810
{\an7}Stop!

01:16.876 --> 01:18.845
{\an8}I do that for you.

{\an3}I am!

02:04.691 --> 02:07.360
{\an5}(Lyrica)
A1 and I aren't
even married yet,

02:07.427 --> 02:09.963
{\an8}and I'm already worried about
our future together.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.098
She (bleep) with
the wrong broad today.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.600
{\an5}(Lyrica)
It's like we're gonna have
birthdays.

02:13.666 --> 02:14.634
We're gonna
have holidays.

02:14.701 --> 02:15.802
I don't wanna be, like,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.470
I'ma go spend
the holiday with my mom.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.972
You go spend the holiday
with your mom.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.840
We supposed to spend
holidays together.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.146
{\an3}(chuckles)

02:27.213 --> 02:29.349
I'm upset, you know?

02:29.415 --> 02:30.683
{\an1}Yeah, I'm sitting here
crying in the middle

02:30.750 --> 02:31.985
{\an1}of a restaurant,
it's embarrassing.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.087
Tonight was supposed
to be a special night.

02:34.153 --> 02:35.288
{\an1}Yeah.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.190
We've been engaged
for a whole year.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.525
And we're still
not married.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.226
{\an1}I'm just really sorry,
you know.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.930
So the right thing
to do for me is...

02:43.997 --> 02:45.498
{\an3}Upgrade ya.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.267
{\an1}(gasping)

02:47.333 --> 02:49.035
Oh, my God!

02:49.102 --> 02:51.371
{\an1}(laughing)

02:51.437 --> 02:52.972
Are you serious?!

02:53.039 --> 02:55.308
Oh, (bleep), turn-up!

02:55.375 --> 02:57.510
{\an5}Oh, my God!

02:55.375 --> 02:57.510
I'm supposed
to put it on you.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.345
Man, you gotta take
the old one off.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.281
{\an5}(A1)
Tonight just didn't
go as planned.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.383
{\an8}I wanted to give Lyrica
this new ring

03:03.449 --> 03:04.851
{\an8}in front of both of our moms.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.787
Actually hoping that
it would unify this family.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.390
Now it's clear that
that's not happening.

03:10.456 --> 03:13.660
But seeing my baby girl's face
light up like that,

03:13.726 --> 03:15.962
that's all that matters to me.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.564
{\an1}Ohh...

03:17.630 --> 03:19.699
I can't even
cry anymore.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.234
All my tears are gone.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.036
{\an1}(laughing)

03:23.102 --> 03:26.205
{\an1}Why would you do that
right now when I'm all upset?

03:26.272 --> 03:28.508
Oh, my-- whew, yas!

03:28.575 --> 03:29.742
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.145
They not gonna mess up
our moment, a'ight, huh?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.613
{\an1}(laughing)
Okay!

03:33.680 --> 03:36.182
Here comes A1,
full of surprises.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.551
Never would've known
he bought me a ring.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.621
But as amazing as this moment
really is,

03:41.688 --> 03:43.423
it's really (bleep) up
that our parents

03:43.489 --> 03:45.258
couldn't be here
to share it with us.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.560
Your mom may say
we're not a family.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.629
{\an1}But I want you to know
that me and you are family.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.031
So, we gotta...

03:52.098 --> 03:53.333
{\an1}She's so fake!
(laughing)

03:53.399 --> 03:54.434
You're not even
hearing me.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.902
I'm gonna have
to talk to you tomorrow.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.203
I'm so excited.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.906
Me and you are family,
no matter what.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.342
Let's not worry
about them tonight.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.479
{\an5}Let's go home
and let's see what you
gonna do for that ring.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.014
Oh, my God.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.482
What you gonna do
for that ring?

04:09.549 --> 04:12.619
{\an1}Whatever you want.
You can get everything.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.420

{\an8}Before I became a mother
and a wife, I was a singer.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.250
{\an8}I put my dreams on hold
so that Willie can chase his.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.020
But he's had a (bleep)-up way
of showing his appreciation.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.222
But now I'm moving past
all this Kyesha drama.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.190
I've been going hard
in the studio,

04:51.257 --> 04:53.059
so I asked my girl
Teairra to stop by

04:53.126 --> 04:55.294
so she can check out
what I've been working on.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.929
{\an5}How are you?

04:55.361 --> 04:56.929
{\an3}I'm good.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.398
I'm ready
to write my life.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.832
{\an5}Like, I'm ready to write...

04:58.464 --> 04:59.832
{\an1}Yes.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.300
{\an1}about the things that
I've actually been through.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.236
{\an1}Like, I feel it
in the music,

05:03.302 --> 05:06.439
{\an1}especially with
everything going on.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.508
{\an5}(Teairra)
I used to think that Shanda's
and Willie's relationship

05:08.574 --> 05:10.076
was something that I wanted.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.278
But she's telling me that he's
been dealing with this chick

05:12.345 --> 05:13.780
on the side for some time.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.315
I don't know all the details,
but, damn,

05:16.382 --> 05:18.551
I can't believe the (bleep)
that Shanda's dealing with.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.653
This bitch Kyesha
is crazy.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.855
{\an1}She's been hitting me up on
Instagram talking about some,

05:22.922 --> 05:24.624
"I'll see you,
I'll see you,"

05:24.691 --> 05:25.892
in my direct messages...

05:25.958 --> 05:27.960
{\an1}Oh, bitch, I hope
I'm with you when she see you.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.629
{\an1}That's crazy
as (bleep), like,

05:29.696 --> 05:31.664
{\an1}that bitch just needs
to be slapped on sight.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.765
That bitch
making diss records.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.933
Bitch, (bleep) you.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.867
{\an1}Oh, she's a--
she's a rapper or a singer?

05:34.934 --> 05:36.969
{\an5}All of a sudden.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.969
{\an1}Oh.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.271
She want her little
five minutes, bitch.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.906
(Shanda)
Yes, I'm upset with Willie,

05:39.972 --> 05:42.375
but this girl is taking
things way too far.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.744
She's hitting me up on
all my social media accounts,

05:44.811 --> 05:46.646
and I feel like
she's stalking me.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.014
{\an5}I need to focus on me.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.014
{\an1}Yeah.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.749
I need to get
back into my music.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.784
What am I supposed to do,
sit here and dwell?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.152
{\an1}You're doing
the right thing.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.354
{\an1}Get in the studio,
do your thing.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.023
I just really wanna
get my stuff out there,

05:57.090 --> 05:59.492
like, even, like, if it's,
like small, intimate...

05:59.559 --> 06:00.626
{\an4}Yes.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.626
{\an3}...places.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.161
Like, I finally
wanna be heard.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.565
{\an1}I don't wanna be looked at
as Willie's wife or the mama.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.867
I was an artist before
I was any of those things.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.769
{\an1}I'm happy that
you're on that road.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.971
{\an1}I think that you
should go and perform,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.474
{\an1}whether it's small or big,
whatever it is.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.143
{\an5}(Shanda)
I'm so ready for my voice
to be heard.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.846
So I searched around and I found
a small open mic night.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.115
I put out a little blast
on social media,

06:22.181 --> 06:23.249
so that some of my friends

06:23.316 --> 06:24.517
could come out
and check me out.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.685
I want you to be there,
I want you come.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.286
{\an1}I will definitely
be there with bells on.

06:27.353 --> 06:28.287
{\an6}Yay.

06:27.353 --> 06:28.287
{\an1}For sure.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.288
{\an3}All right.

06:29.355 --> 06:30.356
{\an1}Get your ass
back in the booth.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.457

06:59.085 --> 07:00.586
He has such a big heart,

07:00.653 --> 07:03.322
and I never really feel like
he's playing games with me.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.892
There are so many things
I have to factor in.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.294
Where am I going?
What are we doing?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.429
What if somebody sees us
and takes a picture

07:10.496 --> 07:12.765
and the other person
finds out?

07:12.832 --> 07:15.568
It's just starting
to become very overwhelming.

juggling two pieces of ass,

08:35.313 --> 08:36.682

you know we wanna know.

{\an1}What you been doing?
'Cause I ain't seen yo' ass...

08:41.787 --> 08:45.591
So, I have a girl
and a guy in my life.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.426
{\an5}It's a girl and a guy?

08:45.658 --> 08:47.426
And a guy?

08:47.493 --> 08:49.562
{\an8}Yes, bitch, it's not so bad,
it's not like dating two men.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.696
{\an7}It's not,
but I'm just surprised

08:50.763 --> 08:52.164
{\an7}'cause I'm just,
like, a girl and a guy?

08:52.231 --> 08:53.532
{\an8}Yeah!

08:52.231 --> 08:53.532
{\an9}Right.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.701
But now yo' bitch ass
gotta say who it is.

08:55.768 --> 09:00.273
{\an1}Okay, so, the first person
I'm dealing with is a model.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.375
A girl named Rosa Acosta.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.443
{\an1}Yeah, I've heard of her
plenty of times.

09:04.510 --> 09:05.811
You know, I have
a good time with her.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.680
It's, like,
just free and fun.

09:07.747 --> 09:08.948
It's not stressful.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.816
You make me wanna
go (bleep) with a woman.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.385
Well, good, good.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.686
Seriously, bitch.

09:13.753 --> 09:14.887
{\an1}I'm like,
what the (bleep)?

09:14.954 --> 09:16.923
Let me know how it goes.
(laughing)

09:16.989 --> 09:19.892
I know Nikki has had some bad
relationships in the past.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.061
So, maybe being with a chick
is the way to go.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.063
But I think
it's just a phase.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.265
{\an1}And so who is the guy,
bitch?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.734
The guy is Safaree.

09:28.801 --> 09:31.270
{\an5}Nicki Minaj?

09:28.801 --> 09:31.270
Nicki's, uh, yeah.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.338
If that's what
you know him as.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.306
I just know him
by Safaree.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.640
I love Nikki,

09:34.707 --> 09:36.175
but I damn sure
did not think that

09:36.242 --> 09:37.576
Safaree would be her type.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.979
Word on the street
is that he's suing his ex

09:40.046 --> 09:43.649
for physical
and emotional abuse.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.750
That's messy.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.652
{\an1}Do you
really like him?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.087
Yes, girl, I really do.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.488
{\an1}Really?

09:49.555 --> 09:51.157
Why y'all looking
at me like that?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.125
I'm just trying
to process it in my own head.

09:53.192 --> 09:58.197
But, I just didn't know that he
would even be in that category.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.633
Yeah, of anybody
on the totem pole...

10:00.700 --> 10:03.502
His situation just
seems really messy.

10:03.569 --> 10:06.472
And I just don't want you
to be involved in that mess.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.874
You know he's been going
through a lot of (bleep).

10:08.941 --> 10:11.110
{\an1}And he doesn't seem like your
type to be honest, like...

10:11.177 --> 10:12.812
To be totally honest.
That's the real--

10:12.878 --> 10:14.347
{\an1}From what I see
social media-wise,

10:14.413 --> 10:15.815
he looks like a lame.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.416
{\an1}He's still trying to use her,
still trying to...

10:17.483 --> 10:18.684
{\an5}He went the extra mile...

10:17.483 --> 10:18.684
{\an1}Yeah.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.787
{\an5}...to "expose" her.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.787
{\an1}Exactly.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.590
{\an4}And it's just, like,
only reason we know
as much as we do,

10:24.657 --> 10:25.858
{\an1}not knowing
either one of them.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.560
He put a lawsuit on her,
period, point blank.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.661
{\an1}You know
what I mean?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.096
{\an1}It's, like, he put
stuff like that out,

10:30.162 --> 10:31.197
{\an1}and I felt like
it was petty.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.231
A lawsuit,
and that's enough.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.199
{\an1}And that's what made
him look lame.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.700
He looks like a lame.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.136
I understand that my girls
are just looking out for me.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.304
And I appreciate that.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.972
But right now,
I'm trying to figure out

10:40.039 --> 10:41.540
how to clean up this mess
I made.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.610
And to be honest, I don't really
wanna end either relationship.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.179
{\an5}If I have a concern,
I promise you guys
will know.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.748
{\an5}That's fine.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.748
As of now, I'm fine.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.282
But, bitch,
if I see a concern,

10:50.349 --> 10:51.851
I'm still gonna
ask you a question.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.319
My only concern right now is
dealing with these two people

10:53.386 --> 10:54.687
who don't know
about each other.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.589
Because my life is getting
a little bit hectic

10:56.655 --> 10:57.957
juggling around
two people.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.225
(Teairra)
Yeah.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.726
She really is not
seeing nobody else.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.029
So she really has feelings
invested with me, you know?

11:03.095 --> 11:05.564
{\an5}And with him,
he's asked me, like, "Oh,
you seeing someone else?"

11:05.631 --> 11:07.099
{\an5}And I'm, like,
"Well, I'm not (bleep)
another man."

11:07.166 --> 11:08.334
She's never asked you that?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.835
She's asked me,
but I kind of like...

11:09.902 --> 11:11.370
Did you say no?

11:11.437 --> 11:12.371
I didn't
tell her the truth.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.341
But did he ever
ask you that?

11:15.408 --> 11:16.842
{\an6}Yeah.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.842
And then what did you say?

11:16.909 --> 11:18.244
{\an1}And I just said, "Well,
I'm not (bleep) another man."

11:18.310 --> 11:19.512
So I didn't think he would
assume another woman.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.213
You know what I'm saying?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.015
{\an5}(Teairra)
I don't know how Nikki's gonna
pull this one off.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.885
Neither Safaree
or Rosa are nobodies.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.153
People know them both,

11:27.219 --> 11:29.155
so it's gonna come out
sooner than later.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.523
So, you don't feel,
like, you need to,

11:30.589 --> 11:33.459
{\an1}like, tell somebody,
one of them?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.062
I really, at this point,
I kind of do feel like--

11:36.128 --> 11:38.030
{\an1}'cause it's like I feel like
I'm living a double life.

Princess has been stressed out
over the wedding.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.692
I've been doing a whole lot
of Scoot-E-Bike business.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.294
{\an8}You know, I just thought
we should just chill out

12:08.360 --> 12:09.862
{\an8}and just do something fun.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.264
{\an8}So, I called up A1 and Lyrica,
they're my folks.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.567
And, you know, they've been
going through the whole thing

12:14.633 --> 12:16.335
with the mama,
and that'll stress you out too.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.038
So, I think this'll be good
for all of us.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.607
Y'all just got engaged?
Congratulations.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.608
Yes...

12:22.675 --> 12:24.243
Thank you,
thank you.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.078
There it is.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.747
{\an7}Um, we got engaged,
um, a year ago.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.349
Everything went good,
like, what...

12:30.416 --> 12:32.184
Oh, you're talking
about the dinner?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.452
{\an4}No, bro.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.452
{\an3}No?

12:33.519 --> 12:35.121
{\an1}You know how long
that dinner lasted?

12:35.187 --> 12:36.122
{\an3}How long?

12:36.188 --> 12:37.256
About ten minutes.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.292
{\an1}The table was turned,
glass everywhere.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.627
So, mamas
was going at it?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.496
{\an5}They was going at it, bro.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.496
{\an3}Damn.

12:43.562 --> 12:44.930
{\an1}When I looked
at his mom's face,

12:44.997 --> 12:46.932
{\an1}she looked like she really
wanted to fight my mom.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.701
{\an1}And it hurt me because
that's still our parents,

12:48.767 --> 12:50.202
you know what I'm saying?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.705
Whoa, I thought
Ray's mom was bad.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.508
But this is like some
fear-for-your-life type stuff.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.610
At least Sonya likes
to fight with her words

12:57.676 --> 12:58.811
and not her fists.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.880
Why do they hate
each other so much?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.815
'Cause her mama crazy.

13:02.882 --> 13:04.517
{\an1}He always puts it
on my mama.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.951
His mama is crazy, too.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.119
{\an1}You'll meet her,
Miss Pam.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.554
When we meet the moms,
are we safe?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.655
Should we wear,
like, helmets?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.223
{\an4}Ohh!

13:09.722 --> 13:11.223
(all laughing)

13:11.290 --> 13:13.859
When I'm listening to Lyrica
and A1 talk about their family

13:13.926 --> 13:16.362
and their mamas,
I was, like...

13:16.428 --> 13:17.730
I thought I had it bad.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.699
This is some
whole other (bleep).

13:20.766 --> 13:22.268
And they mamas.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.470
So, what's gonna happen
when y'all get married?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.972
{\an4}(A1)
It's to the point
where I'm, like, yo,

13:27.039 --> 13:29.508
{\an1}we should just
run off and elope.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.210
{\an1}'Cause I don't even
think we will make...

13:31.277 --> 13:33.712
{\an1}That's what it's gonna
cause y'all to do if y'all...

13:33.779 --> 13:35.114
{\an1}Really?
You agree with that?

13:35.181 --> 13:37.049
Yeah, why don't y'all
just say forget everybody

13:37.116 --> 13:38.450
and just go and elope?

13:38.517 --> 13:41.787
{\an1}Exactly, that's what I'm saying,
we should just do that.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.622
I think they'll respect
y'all more if y'all said--

13:43.689 --> 13:45.758
if y'all just deal
with y'all have to do

13:45.824 --> 13:47.426
and then y'all just
let them know what it is.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.161
{\an4}Really?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.161
{\an3}Yeah.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.931
{\an8}My mom's really spiritual,
and my grandfather's a pastor.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.633
{\an8}So, she looks at it like, "Yo,
if you are gonna be together,

13:54.700 --> 13:56.969
{\an8}you should be married, and you
shouldn't be shaking up."

13:57.036 --> 13:58.971
So, the more
I think about it...

13:59.038 --> 14:00.940
We're getting ready to move
into a new house.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.808
I think that
might make her happy.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.744
Or I could be trying
to talk myself into it.

that every girl could access."

21:28.487 --> 21:31.056
I gotta admit Safaree getting
the same Nikki treatment

21:31.123 --> 21:32.891
that I got is kind of amusing.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.993
At least I know
it's not me this time.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.962
Nikki always play me
hot and cold,

21:37.029 --> 21:38.897
but I know these
Hollywood streets,

21:38.964 --> 21:40.499
and I know that's
how they do it.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.668
You gotta realize, man,

21:42.734 --> 21:44.703
all these women out here
are the same, bro.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.506
They'll play it, like,
close, really close,

21:47.572 --> 21:49.074
like "this is it"

21:49.141 --> 21:51.643
to see what you gonna do,
you feel me?

21:51.710 --> 21:56.114
{\an1}Even though it sucks to hear
this, I still like her.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.684
{\an4}(bleep), if you wanted me
to be a player, bro,
but I'm not, I'm--

21:58.750 --> 22:00.285
I know, that's not you,
you know.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.154
I'm like a loverboy, bro.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.822
{\an1}I like to be like
this with my joint.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.023
But you gotta love
somebody that's gonna

22:05.090 --> 22:07.759
love you the same,
you feel me?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.528
(Safaree)
I'm a one woman kind of guy,

22:09.594 --> 22:11.697
so if Nikki can't
roll with my thing,

22:11.763 --> 22:13.532
I gotta peace out of this.

22:13.598 --> 22:16.401
All I know is that I like Nikki
enough to find out

22:16.468 --> 22:18.403
if there's any truth
to her words.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.305
Yo, dig my thing?

22:20.372 --> 22:22.040
{\an1}I'm not gonna be
a naive...

22:22.107 --> 22:24.443
{\an5}Oblivious, yeah,
you can't be oblivious
to this (bleep), bro.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.244
{\an1}Like, okay, I don't
know what's going on.

22:26.311 --> 22:29.147

is there a third party?

No, what I said was, no...

24:40.579 --> 24:42.047
I don't want

{\an1}That's not gonna happen,

24:46.852 --> 24:49.454
{\an1}I am apologizing
to you now.

24:49.521 --> 24:52.023
And I will apologize to A1.

24:52.090 --> 24:55.727
{\an1}I'm not quite sure
I wanna apologize to her.

24:55.794 --> 24:56.862
Yeah, you should.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.430
{\an1}I don't feel that
I owe her an apology.

24:58.496 --> 24:59.898
You should, Mom, 'cause now
it's starting to interfere

24:59.965 --> 25:02.534
with our relationship,
and that's not fair.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.871
At the end of the day,
we are a family, and we--

25:05.937 --> 25:07.172
{\an1}You and I?

25:07.239 --> 25:11.676
No, me, you, A1,
and Pam are a family.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.511
{\an1}Okay, Lyrica,
that's your family.

25:13.578 --> 25:14.980
Your family, too.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.215
I just met that woman, and all
I've gotten from her is drama.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.984
{\an1}So, she's
not my family.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.486
{\an1}But you gotta understand,
my passion in this, Lyrica,

25:21.553 --> 25:24.756
{\an1}to me, is you and I--
you're my family.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.893
{\an5}(Lyrica Garrett)
I'm not ready to let Pam
into my family.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.295
I probably will never be.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.465
{\an8}For a long time, it's just
been me and my daughter.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.800
Lyrica's twin sister died

25:35.867 --> 25:37.969
one day before
they turned three.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.706
And their father's been out
of their lives since that point.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.976
So, the idea of Lyrica
being someone's wife,

25:45.043 --> 25:48.213
it just makes me feel like
I'm losing my daughter.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.949
{\an1}To me,
you are my life.

25:51.016 --> 25:56.021
{\an1}After Adia died and Johnny
didn't show up at the funeral,

25:56.087 --> 25:59.858
I vowed to protect you,

25:59.925 --> 26:04.362
{\an1}to love you,
and guide you forever.

26:04.429 --> 26:09.734
{\an4}I don't even know
how much of what happened
in the past you remember.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.636
Yeah, I don't really
remember the funeral,

26:11.703 --> 26:13.405
but I remember my dad
not being around.

26:13.471 --> 26:14.706
{\an4}Yeah.

26:13.471 --> 26:14.706
I remember being, like,

26:14.773 --> 26:16.341
"Where's daddy?
Where's my dad?"

26:16.408 --> 26:20.211
{\an1}I told him, "If you don't
show up at the funeral,

26:20.278 --> 26:22.314
you are buried today."

26:22.380 --> 26:23.915
{\an1}And maybe those
were strong words.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.583
But it hurt me so badly

26:25.650 --> 26:28.219
{\an1}that he could give me
an excuse and not be there.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.622
{\an1}So, at the end of the day,
I've been Mom and Dad for you.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.993
{\an1}And maybe I don't know how to be
Mother and Dad for you because

26:35.060 --> 26:38.296
{\an1}this was me
learning on the job.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.965
I want you to be happy.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.900
{\an1}Your happiness
is everything to me.

26:41.967 --> 26:46.838
{\an1}But I feel like I've been
thrown into a situation

26:46.905 --> 26:50.709
{\an1}because of your relationship
with A1 that I've got to put up

26:50.775 --> 26:52.744
{\an1}with somebody who
I have tried to like,

26:52.811 --> 26:54.612
{\an1}but I can't like her--
I've tried.

26:54.679 --> 26:57.949
My mom is my best friend,
and she's definitely earned it

26:58.016 --> 27:00.085
to see me walk down the aisle
and give me away.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.886
That's been a dream of hers.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.188
But what am I
supposed to do

27:03.254 --> 27:04.823
if her and A1's mom
can't even get along?

27:04.889 --> 27:07.392
She says she is done
trying to get along with Pam.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.060
And you know what?
At this point,

27:09.127 --> 27:10.295
I'm done
trying to make them.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.964
{\an1}Do you feel with
all of this dysfunction,

27:13.031 --> 27:14.933
{\an1}with all of this dissention
every time

27:15.000 --> 27:16.401
{\an4}that she and I
come together...

27:15.000 --> 27:16.401
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.870
{\an1}...with even the problems
that you have with her,

27:18.937 --> 27:23.274
you are willing to put
all those things aside?

27:23.341 --> 27:24.743
Because when you marry A1,

27:24.809 --> 27:28.113
{\an1}you're marrying all of his
issues, all of his dysfunction.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.615
{\an5}You're marrying his family.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.615
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

27:30.682 --> 27:34.686

{\an1}What's up?

29:59.397 --> 30:00.498
Hi, how are you?

30:00.565 --> 30:02.100
I'm all right.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.968
{\an8}(Safaree)
I'm glad I met up with
the dudes, because Fizz,

30:04.035 --> 30:07.205
{\an8}he's making me realize that
Nikki's playing me hot and cold.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.607
One day she wanna rub up
all over the yard, man,

30:09.674 --> 30:11.976
and then the next day, I can't
even get her up on the phone.

30:12.043 --> 30:14.078
And I'm definitely not feeling
this photo shoot

30:14.145 --> 30:17.715
with all of these amateur D-list
models that I ain't never seen.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.951
These dudes don't know
what the hell they doing.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.287
They over there rubbing baby oil
all over themselves,

30:22.353 --> 30:23.388
looking dry.

30:23.454 --> 30:24.956
It's all about
the coconut oil.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.691
What you walk in here
all dry for?

30:26.758 --> 30:28.326
{\an1}I got a bone
to pick with you.

30:28.393 --> 30:29.594
{\an3}Oh, okay.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.995
Can y'all give us,
like, five minutes?

30:31.062 --> 30:32.697
Don't come in here
with that attitude.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.499
I don't know why Safaree's
walking in here

30:34.566 --> 30:35.667
with this attitude.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.302
If anything,
I should be annoyed.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.370
He the one calling me
and texting me all day

30:39.437 --> 30:41.239
when I'm sitting here
trying to handle my business.

30:41.306 --> 30:42.674
So, what's up?
Talk to me.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.342
{\an1}Last night I was out
with A1,

30:44.409 --> 30:47.312
{\an4}chilling with him,
talking to him about
how much I like you.

30:47.378 --> 30:50.148
He's asking me if it's real
or not and all that, and...

30:50.215 --> 30:52.817
{\an1}I'm, like, "Yeah."
And the whole night goes by.

30:52.884 --> 30:55.486
You hit me the next morning,
and you say my phone was off.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.255
So, what are you
assuming?

30:57.322 --> 30:58.723
{\an1}We went from speaking
all the time.

30:58.790 --> 31:01.025
{\an1}Any time I FaceTime you or text
you, you hit me right back.

31:01.092 --> 31:02.460
{\an1}You leave,
you go out of town.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.462
{\an1}Ironically, I can't
reach you at all.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.665
{\an1}How do you demand
this much when we just met?

31:07.732 --> 31:09.500
Have I ever lied to you
or given you you a reason

31:09.567 --> 31:12.070
to feel like I'm--
I'm (bleep) somebody else?

31:12.136 --> 31:14.405
I'm not (bleep)
or (bleep) with somebody

31:14.472 --> 31:16.241
(bleep) do nothing
for you to be mad at.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.209
{\an5}I don't know that.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.209
Well guess what?

31:18.276 --> 31:19.410
That's a personal problem.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.912
That's your own issues
you have.

31:20.979 --> 31:23.248
{\an1}The things that I see that
look like it could be wrong,

31:23.314 --> 31:24.549
{\an1}I'm not gonna sit there
and let it just

31:24.616 --> 31:25.917
{\an1}keep on building
and building.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.085
'Cause I've done it before,

31:27.151 --> 31:28.720
{\an1}and all it did
was create poison.

31:28.786 --> 31:31.789
I'm on your side, but you
sitting here fighting me

31:31.856 --> 31:33.057
over what the last
bitch did to you

31:33.124 --> 31:35.226
{\an1}or the one before or whoever
the (bleep) it was.

31:35.293 --> 31:36.461
That's not fair to me.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.029
If somebody else
was in the picture,

31:38.096 --> 31:39.964
do you feel like you have
a right to be mad at me?

31:40.031 --> 31:42.500
{\an5}Do you feel like you--
you're stepping up
in such a way

31:42.567 --> 31:45.503
of a man, financially,
emotionally, mentally,

31:45.570 --> 31:46.904
do you feel like you're
doing all those things

31:46.971 --> 31:48.740
a man should do
to be mad at me?

31:48.806 --> 31:50.541
{\an1}Outside of that, then
you shouldn't say to me,

31:50.608 --> 31:52.810
{\an4}if I am gonna
be dealing with--

31:50.608 --> 31:52.810
I'm just asking you...

31:52.877 --> 31:54.545
It was a yes or no
question.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.214
{\an1}If am gonna be dealing
with somebody else,

31:56.281 --> 31:59.183
you shouldn't be saying to me,
"Safaree, I'm gonna tell you."

31:59.250 --> 32:01.352
I'm not even saying I am!

32:01.419 --> 32:03.254
{\an5}(Safaree)
I don't know why Nikki's
so defensive.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.723
It's like,
I don't pay her bills.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.191
She's grinding hard.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.794
But she's so aggressively
defensive out of the gate,

32:09.861 --> 32:11.829
it just makes me question her
even more.

32:11.896 --> 32:14.799
And then she's telling me
I'm just an insecure dude.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.402
Nah, it's you,
it's not me.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.636
I didn't do nothing wrong.

32:18.703 --> 32:20.238
I'm just out here
minding my business

32:20.305 --> 32:22.674
trying to build with somebody
that I like.

32:22.740 --> 32:26.210
But I don't know
if you on the same page.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.212
I don't wanna be confused.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.348
I wanna know what this is,
you know what I'm saying?

32:30.415 --> 32:33.184
{\an1}I wanna have kids one day,
I wanna get married.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.053
I don't wanna be out here--
one of these dudes out here

32:35.119 --> 32:38.489
{\an5}that's just single
and acting like I'm living
this bachelor life.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.491
{\an1}I wanna be with you,
and then, if you my girl,

32:40.558 --> 32:41.993
{\an1}I want the world
to see you my girl.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.461
You know what I'm saying?
I don't wanna hide that.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.463
Honestly, I'm just trying
to figure it out right now

32:45.530 --> 32:48.499
because I want us
to make sure we're strong

32:48.566 --> 32:50.068
before we can be,
like, okay,

32:50.134 --> 32:51.235
"This is my man,
I'm your woman."

32:51.302 --> 32:52.303
You know
what I'm saying?

32:52.370 --> 32:53.604
{\an1}All right.

32:53.671 --> 32:55.573
If you don't step it up
and really work on

32:55.640 --> 32:57.809
your insecurities
and past ways,

32:57.875 --> 33:01.579
{\an5}it's gonna be very hard
for us to move forward
and build together.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.980
Can we make up?

to be his wife.

34:04.609 --> 34:08.746

35:16.647 --> 35:18.282
You don't know?
We're here.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.283
(muttering)

35:19.350 --> 35:20.952
I'm here, I'm all in.

35:21.018 --> 35:22.653
{\an1}Yeah.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.722
(Lyrica)
I've been waiting for this day

35:24.789 --> 35:26.924
ever since A1 got
on one knee and proposed.

35:26.991 --> 35:29.861
But as excited
as I am for this day,

35:29.927 --> 35:31.829
something just don't feel right.

35:31.896 --> 35:34.165
I never thought
we'd do this alone.

35:34.232 --> 35:36.133
{\an1}You know how I feel,
like, with my mom

35:36.200 --> 35:38.769
{\an5}not being here with us.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.769
{\an3}I mean...

35:38.836 --> 35:40.705
{\an1}And your mom not
being here with us

35:40.771 --> 35:43.140
and just being able to share
the moment of "I dos" and...

35:43.207 --> 35:46.611
{\an1}You know,
as we both know,

35:46.677 --> 35:48.446
{\an1}it's marriage,
and it's forever.

35:48.513 --> 35:51.315
{\an1}And we want that, and we're
happy and we're excited.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.651
{\an1}But it's nothing like
having your family there.

35:53.718 --> 35:56.754
{\an1}No, but at the end of the day,
it ain't about our parents.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.155
It's about me and you.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.992
So, you know,
I'm ready, you ready?

36:01.058 --> 36:02.393
Are you here?

Coming up...

36:08.299 --> 36:09.600
{\an9}We're here.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.736
{\an8}Look, I love you.

36:11.802 --> 36:14.171
{\an8}With all my heart.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.173

walk with me?

36:31.923 --> 36:33.958
{\an3}Don't cry.

{\an3}We're here.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.163
{\an5}What are the tears for?

36:36.527 --> 36:39.163
{\an1}(sniffles)

36:39.230 --> 36:40.898
{\an3}Hmm?

36:40.965 --> 36:44.569
{\an1}It's just 'cause I'm just
emotional about everything.

36:44.635 --> 36:45.670
{\an1}(sniffles)

36:45.736 --> 36:48.005
About what,
this or your mom?

36:48.072 --> 36:49.140
{\an1}Both.

36:50.942 --> 36:54.779
I mean, look...
Look, I love you.

36:54.845 --> 36:57.181
With all my heart.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.449
I'ma be here.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.651
I'm not going
nowhere.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.153
You feel me?

37:02.219 --> 37:05.656
So...
Let's take that walk.

37:06.991 --> 37:09.794
Stop crying.

37:09.860 --> 37:10.861
{\an1}Okay.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.163
{\an1}(sniffles)

37:12.229 --> 37:14.165
{\an1}(laughing)
I know, I look a mess now.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.233
{\an5}No, it's okay.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.233
{\an1}(laughing)

37:16.300 --> 37:17.301
I knew that
was gonna come.

37:17.368 --> 37:20.037
{\an4}Yeah?

37:17.368 --> 37:20.037
{\an3}Yeah.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.405
You gonna take
that walk with me?

37:21.472 --> 37:22.840
{\an4}Yes.

37:21.472 --> 37:22.840
{\an3}Come on.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.945
{\an5}(A1)
I hate seeing Lyrica
so upset about our moms,

37:28.012 --> 37:29.213
and I get it.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.581
(bleep), hurt me, too.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.784
But from now on,
we're a family.

37:33.851 --> 37:37.254
And it's A1 and Lyrica
against the world.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.557
We're here today
to celebrate

37:39.624 --> 37:41.659
the marriage
of two special friends.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.127
You'll promise
to love one another

37:43.194 --> 37:45.896
in sickness and in health,
for better and for worse.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.766
Floyd, do you take Lyrica
to be your wife?

37:48.833 --> 37:50.501
Do you pledge to commit
your life to her,

37:50.568 --> 37:52.837
embracing all joys
and all sorrows?

37:52.903 --> 37:55.172
{\an3}I do.

37:55.239 --> 37:58.009
Lyrica, do you take Floyd
to be your husband?

37:58.075 --> 38:00.111
Do you pledge
to commit your life to him,

38:00.177 --> 38:02.179
embracing all joys
and all sorrows?

38:02.246 --> 38:04.281
I do.

38:04.348 --> 38:07.218
And, Floyd, as you place
this ring on Lyrica's finger,

38:07.284 --> 38:08.986
will you please
repeat after me?

38:09.053 --> 38:11.989
"Lyrica, with this ring,
I thee wed."

38:12.056 --> 38:15.026
Lyrica, with this ring,
I thee wed.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.228
"I give you this ring
as a sign."

38:17.294 --> 38:19.597
I give you this ring
as a sign.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.232
"Of my love
and my faithfulness."

38:21.298 --> 38:23.534
Of my love
and my faithfulness.

38:27.672 --> 38:30.441
And, Lyrica, as you place
this ring on Floyd's finger,

38:30.508 --> 38:31.876
will you please
repeat after me?

38:31.942 --> 38:33.411
Yes.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.746
"Floyd, with this ring,
I thee wed."

38:35.813 --> 38:38.249
{\an1}Floyd, with this ring,
I thee wed.

38:38.315 --> 38:40.951
"Please wear it always
as a symbol of my love."

38:41.018 --> 38:44.021
{\an1}Please wear it always
as a symbol of my love.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.162
And so it is
by the power vested in me

38:51.228 --> 38:52.697
by the laws of the state
of California,

38:52.763 --> 38:57.134
it is my great honor to
pronounce you husband and wife.

38:57.201 --> 38:58.936
You may seal your vows
with a kiss.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.871

39:05.109 --> 39:09.113
{\an5}(Lyrica)
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
that we actually eloped.

39:09.180 --> 39:13.551
I am finally Mrs. Floyd "A1"
Bentley, baby, ah!

39:13.617 --> 39:16.687
Right now, I'm just gonna
relish in this moment

39:16.754 --> 39:19.390
because I know as soon
as we get back to L.A.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.392
and we tell our mothers
what we just did,

39:21.459 --> 39:25.296

39:37.808 --> 39:39.844
{\an8}You know what's
next door to my store?

39:39.910 --> 39:42.813
{\an8}Casa Mia, that Rosa Acosta.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.350

like, one and one.

39:50.688 --> 39:51.922
{\an7}What's up?

39:51.989 --> 39:53.357
{\an8}What's up?

39:56.527 --> 39:58.796
{\an7}Last time I saw you, you was,
like, you was in the studio

39:58.863 --> 40:00.631
{\an8}working on a record, like,
a year and a half ago.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.433
{\an7}Yeah.
I don't know how you feel.

40:02.500 --> 40:06.403
{\an7}I would love to move forward
with that record, but...

40:06.470 --> 40:07.738
{\an8}I've heard about your wife.

40:07.805 --> 40:09.406
{\an8}It's not gonna be
an issue with her.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.408
{\an8}Let me deal with her.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.408
{\an7}Okay.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.144
{\an8}Put your dog on a leash.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.845
{\an8}And a mother(bleep) joke!

40:14.912 --> 40:16.680
{\an8}And best stop talking
(bleep), little girl.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.151
{\an7}That new mother's gonna get
the (bleep) beat out of her
talking (bleep) to me.

40:22.052 --> 40:23.154
{\an8}As a wife, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

40:23.220 --> 40:24.822
{\an8}I'm pissed the (bleep) off.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.223
{\an7}I'm so sorry, man,
I was just...

40:26.290 --> 40:27.224
{\an8}So at this point,
so at this point,

40:27.291 --> 40:28.325
{\an8}what do you expect me to do?

40:28.392 --> 40:29.927
{\an7}I don't know what
I expect you to do.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.896
{\an8}I just know I don't want
you to leave me, though.

40:34.665 --> 40:37.768
{\an7}I need you to promise me that
you're gonna make me a priority,

40:37.835 --> 40:39.537
{\an8}and our wedding, a priority.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.472
{\an8}You're the only priority.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.374
{\an7}So, what about Ray?
Coming or...
