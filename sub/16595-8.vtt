00:03.771 --> 00:05.104
Hey.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.506
Four more days till Turkey Day.
Who's excited?

00:07.508 --> 00:10.442
Obviously not the turkeys.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.512
Well, if they want to die,
they shouldn't taste so good.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.647
This is for Thursday.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.851
Kyle, that is
so sweet of you.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.419
Yeah, whatever it is,
it's from me, too.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.223
Just, it's my first Thanksgiving
as a part of the family,

00:24.225 --> 00:26.625
and I want to contribute
like everyone else does.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.396
Even Boyd does those
amazing hand turkeys.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.265
I mean, what genius
thought of that?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.038
Oh.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.642
Yeah, no.
That's not from me.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.979
So -- So Kyle
gets all the...credit?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.814
His name
is Mr. Gobbles.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.984
He was always the centerpiece
at my family's Thanksgivings.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.586
And no one else
in your family wanted it?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.989
Even when everybody
was fighting, you know,

00:56.991 --> 01:00.159
Mr. Gobbles was always there
to make me smile and feel good.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.361
Aww!
You never told me that story.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.695
That's really sweet.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.065
I can tell
because it wasn't about me

01:06.067 --> 01:08.233
but I still
got heart tingles.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.737
-Bye, Mom.
-See you later.

01:11.739 --> 01:15.441
Oh, you are ug-ly!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.243
What a day at work.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.745
Hey, love.
How are you?

01:19.747 --> 01:20.846
Hey. Hi.
Good.

01:20.848 --> 01:21.613
Hi.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.348
Oh, Boyd make that?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.117
Boy, tell you what --

01:25.119 --> 01:28.520
Art is just not
that kid's thing, right?

01:28.522 --> 01:29.755
No, it's Kyle's.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.024
Mr. Gobbles,
meet Mr. Baxter.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.426
Mr. Baxter,
meet Mr. Gobbles.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.264
Has Mr. Gobbles
met Mr. Garbage?

01:39.266 --> 01:42.434
Have you -- Have you talked
to Chuck since he got back?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.936
I didn't know
that he was back.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.370
Yeah.
Carol said last night.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.439
You might want to go over
and see how he's doing.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.108
Why?

01:49.110 --> 01:51.310
Because he just buried
his father.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.312
He might want to talk
about it.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.980
Why the hell would anybody
want to talk

01:54.982 --> 01:56.148
about something
like that?

01:56.150 --> 01:57.483
Well, Chuck might.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.984
I mean, you're --
you're his friend.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.086
Eh...

02:01.088 --> 02:03.055
Listen, I talked to him
before he left.

02:03.057 --> 02:05.057
Said when he gets back
he could take some time off.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.059
I gave him the best
possible gift -- space.

02:07.061 --> 02:09.561
You give that gift a lot.
(chuckles)

02:09.563 --> 02:13.732
Why do men keep
everything bottled up?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.634
Well, because the best things
come in bottles?

02:15.636 --> 02:16.735
Yeah?

02:16.737 --> 02:17.970
Beer,
those little ships...

02:17.972 --> 02:19.705
light beer.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.576
Why don't you take him
this pie, huh,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.011
and just say hello.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.813
You know,
when my dad dies,

02:27.815 --> 02:32.918
I hope people are sensitive
enough just to leave me alone.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.594
Hey, uh, Chuck.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.429
Hey.
Hey, Baxter.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.431
Carol said you were out
in the garage.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.766
I was.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.435
Now I'm standing
outside it.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.005
Uh...

02:53.007 --> 02:54.573
H-How was the...

02:55.943 --> 02:57.943

02:57.945 --> 03:00.946
Cold.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.515
Yeah, that's Minnesota.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.119
I-I brought you a pie.

03:07.121 --> 03:10.289
Ah.
Yeah, what kind is it?

Um...

03:16.130 --> 03:17.930
Apple.

03:20.034 --> 03:24.570
So, um, listen, if, um,
Vanessa asks, we talked, okay?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.537
Same with Carol.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.806
Yeah.

You know, how, uh...

Look -- Look, man,
I'm fine.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.313
I'm fine.
My dad and I weren't close.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.149
He's been sick for a while.
He's in a better place now.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.750
An expensive urn.

03:38.752 --> 03:43.255
Well, if you need any more
time off, it's okay with me.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.758
I'll take a few days.
Next June, at your cabin.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.062
What are you doing out here
in the garage?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.497
Oh, I'm just, uh, cleaning up
an old car my dad left me,

03:52.499 --> 03:54.266
trying to figure out
what to do with it.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.235
Car? What kind?
What year?

03:56.237 --> 03:58.337
Get out of the way.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.386
Can I open it up?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.354
Go ahead, yeah.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.755
I had one of these, man.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.223
I had the hardtop version
of this,

04:18.225 --> 04:19.591
and Ralph Nader
was wrong.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.094
They don't flip.
You can't get 'em to flip.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.196
Although, it would be
a lot of fun.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.197
Wow!

04:25.199 --> 04:27.099
I drove it back
from Minnesota.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.534
You drove
a 50-year-old classic car

04:29.536 --> 04:31.370
1,000 miles
in the winter.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.971
What were you
thinking?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.274
Well, mostly
I was thinking,

04:35.276 --> 04:38.477
"This car was not made
for a man my size."

04:38.479 --> 04:41.146
You're more of the Bonneville
kind of guy.

like a glove.

So you give me a pie.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.887
Now you want me
to give you a car?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.389
Nah, I was talking
about selling it,

04:50.391 --> 04:52.157

your idea better.

Well, this brings back
some good memories.

If you want to sell it,
I'd consider buying it.

your money, Baxter,

all they know about cars
is you plug them in.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.435
Doesn't know
about American classic

19:31.437 --> 19:33.638
with the rear engine,
unsafe at any speed.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.606
Maybe you can tell him
about this.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.676
Yeah, maybe I could show
Brandon a few things.

19:38.678 --> 19:44.015
Or just sit with him, you know,
ask him how school's going.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.955
If Vanessa asks,
we didn't talk.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.290
(chuckles)

19:52.292 --> 19:55.126
Same with Carol.

19:55.128 --> 19:57.628
Have a nice
Thanksgiving, Larabee.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.364
You do the same, Baxter.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.176
Hey.
I took your advice.

20:12.178 --> 20:16.480
Brandon and I worked
on the Corvair together.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.150
Which means I probably
got to fix something, right?

20:19.152 --> 20:21.986
No, I didn't let him
touch anything.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.556
But, you know [sighs]
we talked the whole time,

20:25.558 --> 20:28.726
and I'm really starting
to like that car.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.496
Well, I hate to lose it,
but the good news is here

20:32.498 --> 20:33.898
that Joe doesn't get it.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.837
Excuse me.
Uh, Chuck?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.006
Oh. Yeah?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.275
I just want to say
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.610
Mm-hmm.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.179
I hope this helps.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.747
Oh.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.350
An old golf club?

20:52.352 --> 20:55.186
It's Richard Nixon's
pitching wedge.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.755
So, you know
you can cheat with it.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.858
Oh, well,
thank you, Ed.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.360
That -- That's --
That's very thoughtful.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.361
It's all right.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.730
Just don't use it on the course,
all right?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.732
-That's a piece of history.
-Okay.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.267
It's also a piece of crap.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.041
Hey, Chuck.
Chuck, listen, uh...

21:17.043 --> 21:18.542
Big fan of Nixon, right?

21:18.544 --> 21:21.112
I'll give you 100 bucks
for that thing.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.380
I don't know.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.483
Maybe I'll sell it to Joe
for $75.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.518
(laughs) Dibs!

21:28.888 --> 21:31.956
