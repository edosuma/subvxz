they'd disintegrate,

05:23.992 --> 05:25.092
but they haven't.

05:25.226 --> 05:26.547

The good news is,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.937
the landlords are gonna repaint,

07:17.071 --> 07:18.271
and you get to pick the color.

07:18.273 --> 07:20.274
I would suggest red.

07:20.442 --> 07:21.442
More good news.

07:21.576 --> 07:23.310
The walls are super thick.

07:23.411 --> 07:24.109

07:26.214 --> 07:27.381
Help!

07:27.549 --> 07:29.316
Please call the police!

07:29.451 --> 07:30.918
They tied me up!

07:31.085 --> 07:33.053
I think they're Filipino!

07:33.221 --> 07:36.123
They took my baby!

07:39.494 --> 07:40.828
You're still being charged

07:40.962 --> 07:42.629
because you returned the cable
box, but not the remote.

07:42.764 --> 07:44.631
So I'm being charged
$100 a month

07:44.766 --> 07:46.600
for a remote control?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.235
I have no idea where that is.

07:48.336 --> 07:50.037
Well, you're gonna have
to track it down

07:50.171 --> 07:52.372
or you'll keep
being charged... forever.

07:55.548 --> 07:56.235

08:02.283 --> 08:04.084
No, please, I really
need the money.

08:04.212 --> 08:05.333

08:05.353 --> 08:06.993

08:07.055 --> 08:08.322

Nooooo...

08:14.863 --> 08:16.621

08:18.196 --> 08:19.499
Can't find this remote.

08:19.668 --> 08:21.102
And I don't understand
this, Ilana.

08:21.203 --> 08:23.304
It's like you have
a thousand socks,

08:23.406 --> 08:24.706
but no underwear
in the underwears drawer.

08:24.807 --> 08:25.847
You don't have to tell me.

08:25.941 --> 08:28.076
I don't know where
my underwear goes.

08:28.177 --> 08:29.411
That's why I'm always
going commando.

08:29.512 --> 08:31.212
Oh, is this it?
No.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.780
That's my old dictaphone
from high school.

08:32.881 --> 08:35.250
Is a dick phone?
Dic-ta-phone.

08:35.351 --> 08:38.153
Oh, I was...
"Hello? Hello, Dick."

08:38.254 --> 08:40.722
Great idea number nine.

08:40.823 --> 08:42.991
It's like Facebook,
but just for photos.

08:44.927 --> 08:47.037
I guess it could be videos, too,

08:47.037 --> 08:48.471
but mostly photos.

08:49.231 --> 08:51.466
Ilana, you invented
the Instagram.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.935
That's insane.

08:54.036 --> 08:56.070
I bet I was high the last
time I had my remote.

08:56.172 --> 08:58.440
Like, for sure!
Yeah, yeah.

08:58.541 --> 09:01.443
Like, certainly.
Certainly, yes.

09:01.610 --> 09:03.578
Maybe if I get high again
I'll remember where I put it.

09:03.679 --> 09:05.346
Aren't you already high?

09:05.448 --> 09:06.648
I-- I mean,
like, more high.

09:06.749 --> 09:09.150
Is "higher."
"Highest."

09:18.994 --> 09:21.019
Last year, Brooklyn.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.146
My old apartment on Flatbush.

09:26.668 --> 09:29.053
Living room...
couch.

09:30.005 --> 09:31.571
Sex on the couch.

09:36.753 --> 09:39.747
Bad sex.
Really bad sex.

09:39.882 --> 09:42.123
The worst sex.
Dale!

09:44.042 --> 09:44.793
Eww...

09:46.675 --> 09:47.421
Dale.

09:50.526 --> 09:52.560
Thank you so much for
coming with me again.

09:52.694 --> 09:54.929
Ilana can't find
her remote, so--

09:55.097 --> 09:56.931
Also, I'm terrified
of Craigslist.

09:57.032 --> 09:59.100
If it ever gets weird,
I'll get you out of there.

09:59.201 --> 10:01.402
I don't want you moving in
with a Craigslist killer.

10:01.503 --> 10:02.804
So scary.

10:02.905 --> 10:04.572
That dude just posted for women,

10:04.673 --> 10:06.040
and then just kills them.

10:06.141 --> 10:07.041
Or do you think
he has sex with them

10:07.142 --> 10:08.276
and then kills them?

10:08.377 --> 10:11.813
Or did he kill them,
then have sex with them?

10:11.914 --> 10:13.514
You're both right.

10:13.615 --> 10:16.050
Oh, sorry, this is Mark.
Please, enter me.

10:16.118 --> 10:17.652
I mean, please, enter me.

10:17.753 --> 10:18.953
Please enter and come on up.

10:20.189 --> 10:21.556
All right.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.734
Ilana?
Hey, Dale.

10:34.893 --> 10:36.137
How are you?

10:36.238 --> 10:38.239
I'm good, I'm good.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.055
Me, too.

10:41.410 --> 10:43.311
Uh, okay, so listen.

10:43.478 --> 10:45.980
Um, this is kind of an awkward
conversation to have,

10:46.148 --> 10:48.049
But do you have...

10:48.183 --> 10:51.052
Herpes?
Yeah, all over.

10:51.186 --> 10:53.287
What?
I have herpes?

10:53.422 --> 10:54.822
That's not what I was
calling about.

10:54.890 --> 10:55.905
Yeah, me neither.

10:56.755 --> 10:58.035
I thought you were someone else.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.701
Okay...

11:01.140 --> 11:02.570
Look, I was calling to ask

11:02.698 --> 11:04.031
if you have my cable remote.

11:04.199 --> 11:06.767
Uh, yeah, I--

11:06.902 --> 11:08.542
I guess it might be
around here somewhere.

11:08.637 --> 11:10.004
Okay, well, I need it.

11:10.138 --> 11:11.672
Why don't you come over?

11:11.840 --> 11:13.040
I'll make my encrusted salmon.

11:13.108 --> 11:15.509
Ew, no, just meet me
in a public place.

11:15.644 --> 11:16.965
What about that
Italian restaurant

11:17.012 --> 11:17.945
where our souls merged?

11:18.080 --> 11:20.047
Our souls never merged dude.

11:20.662 --> 11:21.431
Yeah, I know.

11:22.839 --> 11:23.725
Jesus.

11:24.453 --> 11:26.854
Let's uh-- Let's meet
at Washington Square Park.

11:26.955 --> 11:29.257
Like, 5:00?
I'll be there.

11:29.358 --> 11:31.024
Yikes.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.365
The room is available now.

11:40.695 --> 11:42.201
So this is the living room.

11:43.756 --> 11:44.871
Oh, man!

11:46.040 --> 11:47.329
Look how high
these ceilings are.

11:47.342 --> 11:49.377
Check out this crown
molding right there.

11:49.478 --> 11:51.294
That's priceless.
Whoa.

11:52.881 --> 11:55.016
Oh, there's a massage table.

11:55.117 --> 11:57.084
Yeah, I'm taking classes
at the Swedish Institute.

11:57.185 --> 11:58.519
Cool.
Yeah.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.780
If you let me practice on you,

11:59.788 --> 12:01.429
I could knock a few
dollars off the rent.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.226
Abbi, you gotta
check out the sink.

12:05.327 --> 12:07.769
It's so deep, you could wash
a baby in there.

12:08.937 --> 12:09.896
I have.

12:10.265 --> 12:11.189
Okay.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.863
So what's your shoe size?

12:14.836 --> 12:16.070
Nine.

12:16.162 --> 12:18.423
Hmm.
Men's or women's?

12:21.143 --> 12:23.844
Hey, Lincoln, did you hear
that cool question?

12:23.945 --> 12:25.780
Lincoln?
Abbi, check it out.

12:25.881 --> 12:27.214
There's another room in here!

12:27.315 --> 12:28.816
This place is crazy!

12:28.917 --> 12:30.951
Okay, we gotta get out of here.
Why?

12:31.053 --> 12:32.186
We're leaving.
Why?

12:32.287 --> 12:33.387
We have to--
Ah!

12:33.488 --> 12:34.455
I see you found
my breakfast nook.

12:34.556 --> 12:35.456
Yeah, man.

12:35.590 --> 12:37.124
It's a cool-ass,
big-ass nook.

12:37.259 --> 12:38.459
The one bathroom is in there.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.561
But it's pretty much
your private bathroom.

12:40.662 --> 12:41.382
I almost never go.

12:42.618 --> 12:44.305
Except when I do go,
I really go.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.848
It's a major problem.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.768
You'll have to stay in a hotel
for a couple days.

12:47.803 --> 12:48.893
I'll pay for it, of course.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.773
Lincoln, you wanna...
help me?

12:51.874 --> 12:53.775
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Abbi, sorry.

12:53.876 --> 12:54.816
It's okay.

12:55.945 --> 12:56.978
What hotel?

12:57.079 --> 12:58.513
Holiday Inn Express?

12:58.614 --> 12:59.881
She'll take it.
No.

12:59.982 --> 13:01.222
Thank you so much.
Lovely place.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.350
Come on, we're leaving.

13:14.329 --> 13:15.596
Ilana!

13:15.697 --> 13:17.130
Oh... God...

13:18.433 --> 13:19.433
Hey.

13:19.568 --> 13:20.768
Here.
Dale--

13:20.902 --> 13:23.103
These are for you.
"It's a boy"?

13:23.238 --> 13:25.206
It's all they had left
at Key Foods.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.007
Okay...
Okay...

13:27.142 --> 13:28.709
Okay, please...
All right.

13:28.877 --> 13:30.444
Ilana, listen.

13:30.545 --> 13:31.866
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.614
I know why you left that remote.

13:33.715 --> 13:35.398
You want to get back together.

13:36.718 --> 13:37.851
And I'm in.

13:37.986 --> 13:42.405
Dale, we were never together!

13:42.524 --> 13:44.741
We were roommates who had sex

13:45.160 --> 13:46.961
a small handful of times

13:47.062 --> 13:48.495
because the train wasn't running

13:48.597 --> 13:49.797
to Manhattan on the weekends.

13:49.898 --> 13:51.899
Say the word, and I'll
leave my fiancèe.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.033
You're engaged?

13:55.604 --> 13:58.672
And you brought her?
What is wrong with you?

13:58.807 --> 14:00.047
Just say you'll give us a shot,

14:00.075 --> 14:01.396
and I'll give the driver
a signal,

14:01.509 --> 14:04.385
and he will take her straight
to Newark airport.

14:06.081 --> 14:07.430
Give me the remote.

14:10.318 --> 14:11.059
Come on.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.269
Thanks for the balloons.

14:14.273 --> 14:16.233
Please don't tell Amanda
I told you I'd leave her.

14:16.258 --> 14:17.625
Please don't tell her

14:17.726 --> 14:19.393
I bought her a one-way ticket
to Santa Fe.

14:19.494 --> 14:21.551
What?
Please don't tell her I have herpes!

14:23.065 --> 14:25.066
Do I or do I not have herpes?

14:25.234 --> 14:26.616
I do, you don't.

14:27.903 --> 14:29.670
Oh, God!

14:30.132 --> 14:32.812
I want to read so many of this books.

14:33.342 --> 14:34.476
This is unreal.

14:34.577 --> 14:36.611
I can't believe I can
get a room in Manhattan

14:36.712 --> 14:37.779
for 900 bucks a month.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.447
See, I told you
you'd find something.

14:39.548 --> 14:40.615
This place is perfect.

14:40.716 --> 14:42.924
Hey, if she doesn't
get the room, I might.

14:44.287 --> 14:45.754
No, I'm taking it.
Stop.

14:45.855 --> 14:48.156
Well, we go to Priya's mom's
beach house most weekends,

14:48.257 --> 14:49.937
so you'll have the place
to yourself a lot.

14:50.026 --> 14:52.127
Wow.
We make dinner every night,

14:52.228 --> 14:53.862
and our sex is
on the quiet side.

14:53.963 --> 14:56.898
Yeah, so is mine,
with myself, right?

14:56.999 --> 14:57.939
Yeah!

14:59.335 --> 15:01.703
I think I speak for Priya
when I say

15:01.804 --> 15:03.705
we would love to have you
as a roommate.

15:03.806 --> 15:05.740
Yes, that would be awesome.

15:05.841 --> 15:07.642
Do I dare say we toast?

15:07.743 --> 15:09.210
I double dare ya!

15:09.312 --> 15:11.536
Let's do it.
Thank you.

15:12.548 --> 15:15.684
To built-ins, countertops
you can chop right on,

15:15.785 --> 15:19.054
and toilets with two
flush buttons-- cheers.

15:19.155 --> 15:20.488
Yeah.

15:20.589 --> 15:23.258
♪ SelectDate, SelectDate

15:23.359 --> 15:24.639
Oh, wait,
this is the commercial.

15:24.727 --> 15:26.847
This is the illustration
I was telling you guys about.

15:26.929 --> 15:28.330
Man, this is so cool.

15:28.431 --> 15:29.764
I did this.

15:33.691 --> 15:34.332
Jack?

15:38.297 --> 15:40.809
On a date with someone
who isn't your type?

15:40.910 --> 15:43.144
They're just not like you.

15:43.312 --> 15:45.347
What does he mean,
"not like you"?

15:45.448 --> 15:47.315
But with SelectDate,
you get to choose

15:47.483 --> 15:49.084
from the cream of the crop.

15:49.185 --> 15:51.784
Because we only deal
with the cream.

15:53.890 --> 15:56.525
For whites who are single
and ready to mingle.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.527
Oh...
SelectDate,

15:58.628 --> 16:02.003
the final solution
to your dating problems.

16:07.063 --> 16:08.537
What the (bleep), Abbi?

16:08.671 --> 16:10.439
No, no, that is not--

16:10.573 --> 16:12.908
I wouldn't ever do
something like that.

16:14.182 --> 16:14.902
'Cause I--

16:15.645 --> 16:16.945
I just drew happy couples.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.081
Like, 'cause I love couples.
I love people.

16:19.215 --> 16:21.016
I just love people.
Like, I love, like--

16:21.117 --> 16:22.351
I love all races.

16:22.518 --> 16:25.387
"Races," not "racists."

16:25.555 --> 16:26.621
You guys are--
I wouldn't--

16:27.466 --> 16:28.323
And it's a--

16:28.491 --> 16:29.925
It's probably not national.

16:30.059 --> 16:32.394
It's just like, um--
Probably it's just--

16:34.350 --> 16:35.203
I'm so sorry.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.399
I don't know her that well.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.701
I'm just--
I'm bonin' her friend,

16:39.836 --> 16:41.436
and so I just hang out with her.

16:41.604 --> 16:42.471
You know how you gotta hang out

16:42.605 --> 16:44.072
with your girl's friends?

16:48.711 --> 16:49.550
Hmm.

16:52.629 --> 16:54.347
No, this is the wrong remote.

16:55.951 --> 16:57.934
What must I do?

16:58.320 --> 16:59.421
What do you want from me?

16:59.588 --> 17:01.823
Look, lady, this is
the wrong remote,

17:01.924 --> 17:03.224
and this is the right remote.

17:03.392 --> 17:05.191
Okay, you gotta get
the right remote.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.304
I had to find out I may
or may not have herpes

17:07.329 --> 17:08.361
to get this remote!

17:09.273 --> 17:10.674
Can I speak to
your manager, please?

17:10.699 --> 17:11.948
Oh, I am the manager.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.234
I also do billing,
installation programming,

17:14.369 --> 17:16.204
and I compose
the "on hold" music.

17:16.338 --> 17:17.539
You composed this music?

17:17.673 --> 17:19.840
Oh, no, no, this is
the "waiting room" music.

17:19.942 --> 17:20.998
I compose that too.

17:22.778 --> 17:25.294
I'm actually the only
person who works here.

17:25.948 --> 17:26.878
Yikes.

17:28.063 --> 17:29.851
Okay, what are my options?

17:29.985 --> 17:31.920
You can either mail in
a check for $1,000,

17:32.021 --> 17:33.988
or come in person and pay $5.

17:34.123 --> 17:35.883
You're only the fifth person
ever to come in.

17:35.891 --> 17:36.791
Oh...

17:36.926 --> 17:37.515
Here.

17:38.427 --> 17:39.587
I can pay in quarters, right?

17:39.595 --> 17:41.563
Oh, actually, no.
Our system's down

17:41.697 --> 17:42.697
and we only take nickels.

17:43.332 --> 17:44.105
Sorry.

17:45.935 --> 17:47.536
Oh, and you know what?
I hate your music.

17:49.405 --> 17:50.403
So do I.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.078
Oh, my God.

18:09.725 --> 18:10.673
Hey, Abidab,

18:11.927 --> 18:14.796
I really wanted to
apologize for last night.

18:14.930 --> 18:16.304
We don't need to get into it.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.348
Well, I did make you
these bagel bites.

18:20.236 --> 18:22.237
I put 'em in the shape
of an "A" because

18:22.338 --> 18:24.439
I know how you like
to label your food.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.574
Listen, when you
came in last night,

18:26.675 --> 18:28.943
and-- and I was
touching myself...

18:29.044 --> 18:30.011
Can we please not?

18:30.112 --> 18:31.779
So...
Well, let me just--

18:31.914 --> 18:33.815
I really want to explain.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.283
See, I was pleasuring myself.

18:35.451 --> 18:36.284
I don't need to--

18:36.418 --> 18:37.952
I like to start off slow, okay.

18:38.087 --> 18:40.622
And then I like to work
the tempo up and up and up.

18:40.723 --> 18:42.590
And I'll-- I'll lick a thumb...
Seriously, I-- This is--

18:42.691 --> 18:44.292
...and then sort of
brush it lightly

18:44.393 --> 18:46.528
against the nipples.
Why are we going over this?

18:46.629 --> 18:48.062
And then, there's a--
There's a--

18:48.197 --> 18:50.431
You know, in the (bleep),
or whatever you call it,

18:50.566 --> 18:52.066
there's a sort of
a (bleep) there.

18:52.201 --> 18:54.869
I like to apply pressure
to that slowly.

18:55.004 --> 18:57.605
And then right when
I'm (bleep), I (bleep),

18:57.740 --> 19:00.542
then I (bleep) into
the (bleep), hard, hard, hard.

19:00.676 --> 19:02.844
And then I (bleep),
and it just--

19:02.978 --> 19:04.946
You know,
it-- it-- it--

19:05.080 --> 19:07.215
It's a very powerful feeling.

19:07.349 --> 19:09.774
Whoa, cool shirt.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.365
You don't need tell me
Sour Patch Kids are good,

19:18.365 --> 19:20.451
I know Sour Patch Kids are good.

19:21.397 --> 19:22.823
Oh, Lincoln, I don't
have herpes,

19:22.823 --> 19:24.317
and neither do you--
that's all.

19:24.317 --> 19:26.582
Ilana, there is a child
right here.

19:26.603 --> 19:28.304
Please.
We're in New York.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.592
And you're, like, 12, right?

19:29.639 --> 19:31.774
I'm seven, and you're
being inappropriate.

19:31.942 --> 19:33.475
Bitch, you're 22.

19:33.577 --> 19:37.079
Okay, listen,
your dentist and I, um,

19:37.180 --> 19:40.282
have been having...
sexual intercourse

19:40.450 --> 19:41.930
on the regular
for about five months--

19:41.985 --> 19:44.320
Ilana, it's been
a year and a half!

19:44.487 --> 19:46.288
For real?
18 months.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.587
God.

19:49.092 --> 19:50.893
Don't do drugs.

19:50.994 --> 19:52.962
That's--
That's the takeaway.

19:53.096 --> 19:54.597
Don't do drugs.

19:54.731 --> 19:57.166
It's like I have
no memories, man.

19:57.334 --> 19:58.667
I can't remember a thing!

19:58.768 --> 20:01.303
I wake up, I'm like aah!
It's scary.

20:01.438 --> 20:03.572
I just, like, don't know
where I am a lot of the time.

20:03.673 --> 20:05.941
I can't find that remote.
I-- I--

20:06.076 --> 20:07.209
I'm missing hundreds
of pairs of underwear.

20:07.310 --> 20:08.277
Literally hundreds.

20:08.445 --> 20:09.725
You never found
the right remote?

20:10.122 --> 20:10.918
No.

20:11.748 --> 20:14.183
But wherever it is,
I hope it's happy.
