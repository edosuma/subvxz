00:07.216 --> 00:09.301
So I was wondering if you
would like to get a drink
with me sometime?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.303
Guys, you're gonna wanna
look at your phones...

00:11.303 --> 00:13.222
We used to be best friends.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.224
Until Mariana showed up,
and you chose her.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.059

The development company

what's right from wrong.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.360

more discipline than others.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.986

like a criminal,

08:06.986 --> 08:08.238

to become one.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.102
Can we talk about
my privacy proposal
for the new app?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.311
No. Evan is not gonna like it.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.984
What we can talk about,
is this salary
laddering bullshit.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.029
And how it's gonna turn
a meritocracy into mediocrity.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.031
What can you tell me about
the new salary laddering plan?

10:15.031 --> 10:17.117
I understand that's another
project you all took on.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.244
Well, laddering levels
the playing field

10:19.244 --> 10:22.122
and ensures income equality
for women and people of color

10:22.122 --> 10:25.416
doing the same work,
as say, their
white male counterparts.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.128
It's not just about the women.
I'm finally being paid

10:28.128 --> 10:30.421
as much as Sam
for doing the same work.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.133
‐But is it the same work?
‐No.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.134
I rest my case.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.971
‐Raj's is better.
‐What? How so?

10:38.221 --> 10:41.141
Oh. Look who's ready
for his close up.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.143
Sam:
Is my work even good?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.019
It's your girlfriend's
boyfriend.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.984
Uh, Mariana. Can you have
a seat there, maybe.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.277
‐Looks great. Feel good?
‐Yeah.

10:52.986 --> 10:53.987
Evan:
Uh, yes...

10:56.156 --> 10:57.073
(shutter clicks)

10:59.075 --> 11:00.994
So Evan, an activism app
doesn't seem like

11:00.994 --> 11:03.371
an obvious choice
for Speckulate.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.415
Well, maybe not
the old Speckulate.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.959
So Mariana's
enlightened you.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.211
Ah, she has, uh,
definitely opened my eyes

11:10.211 --> 11:12.255
to many things
that needed fixing.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.341
And, Mariana. You've only
been here a short time.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.303
What was it like pitching
your idea to uh, the boss?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.139
Oh. Well, I was terrified.

11:21.973 --> 11:25.435
Really? Huh.
Seemed cool
as a cauliflower.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.023

Um, no, I wasn't
cool as anything.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.357
I was a nervous wreck.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.443
And, uh, what was your
first impression of Mariana?

11:35.111 --> 11:40.408
Uh... well...
I thought she was
incredibly bright.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.994
And confident.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.329
Enthusiatic.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.289

11:51.294 --> 11:52.295

11:55.965 --> 11:57.383

about Raj's work

11:57.383 --> 11:59.010
being better than mine...

11:59.010 --> 12:00.178
‐...right?
‐Nope.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.262
He's more focused
than you.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.057
Yeah, sure, I'd be
focused on work too

12:04.057 --> 12:06.392
if I had to watch my boss
do publicity porn
with my girlfriend.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.978
Alex:
There's so many things
wrong with that statement.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.064
First, the idea of you
even having a girlfriend.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.066
‐Sam: Someday‐‐
‐Alex: And two,

12:13.066 --> 12:17.070

Have you ever tried
to like cook or shower...

12:20.406 --> 12:22.450
Evan,

your sleeves a bit.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.246

18:33.404 --> 18:35.114

I thought it was cool.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.243
I read that a lot of the miners
didn't speak the same language.

So even if they
were allowed to talk,
they couldn't.

18:43.414 --> 18:46.334

What is so special about
this particular building?

32:51.344 --> 32:55.015
I don't know.
Why don't you
ask your boyfriend?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.354
So you're okay with me
and Isabella?

33:01.354 --> 33:02.397
Yeah.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.107
Of course I am.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.484
I fell back that Raj
is stuck on blue team

33:06.484 --> 33:08.445
and I'm getting all of
this attention for the app.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.281
I just wish that
there was something

33:11.281 --> 33:13.241
that he as passionate about,
that made him happy.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.076
Isabella:
Well, he loves magic.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.078
I mean, he could get
good enough to perform.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.164
He's terrified to get
up in front of people.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.333
Even pitching at work
gives him heart palps.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.420
But what about people
who aren't adults?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.341
I think I may have an idea.

33:31.426 --> 33:35.138
You don't need
my approval to do
kids' parties with Isabella.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.141
You get to perform your magic
which I know you love.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.184
I did crush it.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.188
‐You sure?
‐Yes.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.148
If it makes you happy,
it makes me happy.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.484
(quietly):
Okay.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.028
So what did you
want to tell me?

33:51.446 --> 33:52.989

33:56.243 --> 33:58.203

they're going out of
the rental business.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.056

35:08.315 --> 35:12.193
Wow. It sounds like
you were very persuasive.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.238
Where I was persuasive was
in convincing CC Hastings

35:15.238 --> 35:17.324
to double the money
they're offering the tenants.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.326

of affordable living units.

35:19.326 --> 35:20.994
It's still wrong.

Yeah, it doubled
the event donations
by $10,000

37:41.050 --> 37:44.345
and Evan picked up the tab.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.100

now I remember.
I was really drunk.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.998
And upset after
you had drinks with Evan

38:11.998 --> 38:14.000
and didn't tell me
and so I

38:14.959 --> 38:16.294

‐I can go.
‐No, stay.

keep me from killing Raj.

‐I was really drunk.
‐Bad excuse.

gonna think that Evan
gives me special treatment.

is gonna matter at all.

For the record, I told Alex
the glitch was my fault.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.285

And it was whiskey...

38:49.285 --> 38:50.411
Okay, still bad, Raj.

At least we know it was Alex.
