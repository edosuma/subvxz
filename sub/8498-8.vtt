<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:31.800 --> 00:36.430
<i>Women write their history
in the words that pass between them.</i>

00:36.520 --> 00:37.589
Hello.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.956
<i>Too often, we leave no trace
beyond the children born,</i>

00:41.040 --> 00:43.838
<i>the clothing stitched,
the service given,</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:48.357
<i>the choices made,
if there was choice at all.</i>

00:50.000 --> 00:52.070
<i>But in 1961,</i>

00:52.520 --> 00:56.433
<i>we were choosing routes
and taking byways never walked before.</i>

00:57.640 --> 01:00.473
<i>We did not hesitate or stumble,</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:04.473
<i>because all roads were unexplored
and everything was possible.</i>

01:07.280 --> 01:10.875
Yesterday's referral letters for
the Family Planning Association clinic.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.272
If you sign them now, we'll get them off
ahead of this morning's batch.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.193
There must be a queue
right round the block at that clinic.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.158
There's a queue right round
our waiting room this morning.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.152
Sandrine Weller's in next. Miss.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.869
Unmarried women can't be referred
for oral contraception.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.230
It's no better than
the Dutch cap in that regard.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.437
Rules are rules, Patrick.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.669
- It isn't what we hoped for.
- No. But it's a start.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.758
And you still change lives.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.319
For the better.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.677
Coo-ee! Violet!

01:44.760 --> 01:47.513
Hello, Tessie.
You remember Tessie, don't you, Fred?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.477
Her brother married my cousin Enid.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.472
Yes, and he was never happy again.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.233
Mitchell, put your shoulders back
and say hello to Violet.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.629
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello, Mitchell, love.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.950
I'm sorry it didn't work out
for you in Australia.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.429
I've a bloody good mind
to write to that prime minister.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.909
They're quick enough to ship 'em
out there for £10 a head.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.176
And then, if they don't like it
and they wanna come home,

02:06.200 --> 02:08.316
it's pay the full whack
for your ticket, or swim.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.791
Oh. I heard you was working
on a sheep farm.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.799
That can't have been very pleasant.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.395
The things they had him chopping off
would have turned your stomach.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.995
- Suffice to say, it weren't just wool.
- Ah, I'm a city lad, Violet.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.256
I've got steady work on the tools
at Lipkin's Plumbing now.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.191
- Oh!
- Ah, good for you.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.432
The East End raised you, now you can get
stuck in and sort its khazis out.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.351
Thank you.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.752
He doesn't need compost
all over his lapels.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.512
We're on our way to a consultation.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.914
Mum, there's a notice in the window.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.511
Oh, so much for,
"Knock and it shall be opened unto you."

03:02.000 --> 03:04.958
Coo-ee! Reverend.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.392
Oh! We want to organise a wedding.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.920
Well, then I should put a shirt on.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.592
I think
that would be preferable.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.958
Mitchell's got a fiancée.
She's Australian.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.616
He's had to leave her behind until
they have enough for her passage,

03:18.640 --> 03:21.393
and now she's on the <i>SS Canberra,</i> and...

03:21.680 --> 03:24.035
Well, she's in the family way.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.030
- Well, how far along in the family way?
- Far enough.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.696
Mitchell never knew when he set off,
and I can't say I'm sorry,

03:30.720 --> 03:32.560
because if he had,
he never would've come home.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.994
I'm sure he wouldn't.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.310
But, Mitchell,
as soon as your fiancée arrives,

03:36.400 --> 03:37.913
we could start to plan the wedding.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.718
It takes three weeks to call the banns.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.837
We haven't got three weeks.
We might not even have three days.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.353
The ship was delayed at Cape Town

03:44.440 --> 03:46.715
and by the time they dock,
Noelle might've given birth.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.836
Well, under the circumstances,
no one will condemn her, or the child.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.634
- It will still be a bastard.
- Mum...

03:54.160 --> 03:57.038
I want 'em married
the minute that boat docks.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.636
My goodness, young Lenny,
you are filling out nicely.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.109
Have you got bricks in your pockets?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.350
Marbles?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.715
Well, must be all that extra milk
we're getting into you.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.236
Now, off you hop, and Sister Monica Joan
will give you a liquorice allsort.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.112
It is Sooty who is handing out
the liquorice allsorts today, not I.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.670
You've got her well wrapped up.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.799
Oh, she feels the cold, does Susan.
And it's gotten quite nippy out.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.955
I'd have loved a little girl.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.158
Oh, she's got the face of an angel.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.794
Oh, I wish she had
the lungs of an angel.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.678
You should see her kicking off
when something doesn't suit.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.352
- Proper Miss Determined, she is.
- It's probably just as well.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.833
You can take that blanket off
if she's hot.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.792
I don't mind, honest.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.069
- Mrs Mullucks and Susan.
- Yeah.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.268
You've got quite a grip
in those little fingers, Miss Mullucks.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.670
She can hold a rattle in them,
Dr Turner, and a spoon.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.235
She can't get it
in her mouth yet, but...

05:12.320 --> 05:16.199
Most children can't feed themselves
until they're a wee bit older.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.154
Last time we were
in the children's hospital,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.356
there was a little boy
born just like Susan,

05:21.440 --> 05:23.670
only with proper legs and feet.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.990
And he was having his fingers amputated.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.912
Doctors said they'd be no use to him
'cause they were so misshapen.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.718
I think you should encourage Susan
to lean towards things, Rhoda,

05:35.800 --> 05:36.994
try to pick them up.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.037
She has some muscle at the shoulder
and it may be she can develop it.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.536
Should I make her an appointment
with the occupational therapist?

05:44.560 --> 05:48.155
Oh, Rhoda! Don't cry.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.877
You're doing so well.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.116
I remember you saying that to me
when I was having her.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.793
"You're doing so well."

05:57.960 --> 05:59.757
"You're doing so well."

06:00.880 --> 06:04.156
And I thought
once I'd pushed her out,

06:05.520 --> 06:07.238
the pain'd be over.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.992
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.278
Sister Winifred had a fainter,
sweet tea and a ginger nut required.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.634
- Ugh!
- What happened to you?

06:19.720 --> 06:22.712
Ugh! Baby Williams evacuated his bowels
at the weighing station.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.712
Well, you can't go back out
covered in all sorts.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.917
That is a very copious stool.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.078
Have you spoken to the mother
about his feeding pattern?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.256
Would you like to talk to her?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.240
I'm very happy to do
the child development checks.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.397
No, Nurse. You know my policy,
and I am standing firm.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.632
Babies are a two-handed job.
I do not handle newborns any more.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.277
Here, here. It's creased,
but clean as a whistle.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.871
And make sure you speak to Mrs Williams.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.394
When she's tucked in her pram
or all wrapped up, it's not so bad.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.995
She looks like any other baby
and people don't stare.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.279
Or when she's in the house,
I just have her in a nappy and a vest,

07:03.760 --> 07:08.436
and she sits there all propped up
smiling like nothing's the matter.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.431
And then I remember,

07:10.520 --> 07:14.399
in the middle of the night,
I remember that she's got no arms.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.035
And no legs.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.954
I just lie there shaking.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.474
Are you getting much sleep, Rhoda?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.030
Because we can help with that.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.636
I can give you a mild sedative.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.718
And you can take it
only when you need it.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.951
It's called Distaval.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.393
If I can't fix her,
I've got to fix myself.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.715
On my next day off, I'm going
to buy myself a new pair of pantyhose.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.360
"Pantyhose"?
What on Earth are pantyhose?

07:45.440 --> 07:48.193
They're a new kind
of suspender-less stocking.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.872
They've had them in America for years.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.315
You make that sound
like a recommendation.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.719
But think, Phyllis.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.713
No metal clips, no buttons, no belts.
Nothing digging in.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.917
Just silky, whisper-light nylon

08:01.000 --> 08:03.719
clinging like a second skin
from waist to toe.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.469
Sounds like a breeding ground for yeast.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.829
Oh, I wish we had
one of those plastic tomatoes.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.760
I can't get anything
out of this bottle at all.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.150
Is there nowhere a woman can get 40
uninterrupted winks around this place?

08:23.240 --> 08:26.038
Five minutes to gather my thoughts
before Compline,

08:26.120 --> 08:28.429
that's all I ask, and what do I get?

08:28.520 --> 08:30.909
Conversations about nylons,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.833
and sauce bottles being banged
like it's going out of fashion.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.231
Sorry, Sister Evangelina.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.278
I take it we can't tempt you
to a savoury snack?

08:48.360 --> 08:49.554
No!

08:50.640 --> 08:51.755
Oh!

08:57.600 --> 08:59.795
- Morning, Tessie.
- Violet.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.871
I heard about Mitchell's fiancée.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.714
Oh, bless the girl,
coming all that way across the world.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.433
Love knows no boundaries.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.240
- Who told you?
- Mr Ballard at the stationers.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.676
And he said you was in yesterday
ordering wedding invitations.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.273
Yes.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.909
And today I've come to you
to order two dozen nappy pins,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.470
two dozen terry squares,
six pairs of plastic pants,

09:22.560 --> 09:26.075
a heavy-duty sanitary belt
and a packet of maternity towels.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.354
And none of it's for me.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.675
I see.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.070
Well, you'll have to get her signed up
with the sisters, Tessie.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.074
Mum. Noelle's ship's in tomorrow.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.680
It was in the paper.
I called in the dock office

09:38.760 --> 09:39.960
and they said it was definite.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.675
You'd better add
a maternity girdle to that list.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.718
I have my doubts
about Australian foundation garments.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.633
Congratulations.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.754
That's absolutely perfect, Tripti.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.238
There's no need to thank me, Muna.
It's all part of the job.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.195
Now, let's get you on the bed
and see if we can have a listen to Baby.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.439
Oh, Mr Valluk!

10:18.520 --> 10:21.671
I beg your pardon.
Are you working shifts again?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.235
I'm sorry, but

10:25.720 --> 10:26.948
he will not look.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.635
It's all right.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.759
Once I delivered a baby with the father
fast asleep beside his wife.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.991
But he was drunk,
and Mr Valluk just looks tired.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.074
It's not the home we left,
but it is a new home.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.516
That is why I want the baby born here.
In my bed.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.829
And if that is what you want,
that is what you shall have.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.829
Something is bite you?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.111
No. Not at all.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.679
Hello, Mum.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.830
What d'you think you're doing,
pitching up early?

11:07.920 --> 11:10.673
They let her off the boat first
because she's in the family way.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.796
There's certainly no missing it,
is there?

11:13.280 --> 11:15.669
And here she is. This is Noelle.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.549
I was gonna put balloons up
and a notice saying, "Welcome!"

11:19.640 --> 11:21.517
But I didn't want you
to think I was common.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.513
The house looks lovely.
Can I call you Tessie, Mrs Anselm?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.759
I think you'd better call me Mum.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.430
I think I'm allergic to fleas.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.351
I never get just a little bite mark,
always a great itchy welt.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.238
There are some houses I go to
where I have to wear bicycle clips

11:43.320 --> 11:46.118
to stop the fleas
going up my trouser legs.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.316
And yet people try so hard.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.155
It's almost always the landlords' fault.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.896
Where there are bad drains,
there are rats,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.560
and where there are rats,
there are fleas.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.959
Or bed bugs.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.776
Bed bugs can really sink their teeth in
when you're sitting with the dying.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.918
And on that romantic note,
where are we going to go this evening?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.712
I have it on good authority

12:06.800 --> 12:10.395
that the Palace Picture House
was fumigated just last week.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.628
I don't want to go
to the cinema tonight.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.948
I want to talk to you.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.637
I'm always agreeable to that.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.231
And perhaps dance a little?

12:23.480 --> 12:25.277
I'm agreeable to that, too.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.669
Although, please note,
I'm not wearing any Brylcreem.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.832
So wherever we go,
the walls will be quite safe.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.360
I can't believe I'm finally
getting my own passport.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.838
I can't believe you've never had one.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.560
Your dad was a ship's broker
who travelled the world.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.676
Mine had a draper's shop
in Pembrokeshire.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.520
I'm amazed my mother
doesn't get vaccinations

12:51.600 --> 12:54.353
when she comes to London
to visit Auntie Blod.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.635
- When's she coming again?
- Monday.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.200
I already wrote to ask her
to bring my birth certificate.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.673
What is it?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.468
That woman's here again.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.073
The one that sneaks
the gin into her coffee.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.875
I used to think she was on the game,
but I've never seen her with a client.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.237
I just think she's lonely.
Or heartbroken.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.718
Or both, maybe.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.390
She looks familiar somehow.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.590
But I don't think I know her.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.872
I've no objection to them converting
the attics at the Mother House,

13:36.960 --> 13:39.838
but why do they have to send us
all their junk and tat?

13:39.920 --> 13:44.152
I have merely managed to unearth
two copies of <i>Jessica's First Prayer</i>

13:44.720 --> 13:46.790
and <i>The Collected Works of Walter Scott.</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:49.440
Mmm, that sounds like Sister Eustace.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.473
There was always
a strange streak about her.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.677
I never knew
if it was violence or romance.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.275
This one seems to be
full of party frocks.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.920
There must be half a dozen of them.
And they're all white.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.271
It's my wedding dress.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.032
Really?

14:05.120 --> 14:09.398
I'll never forget putting this on
to take my vows and enter the novitiate.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.119
I had to wear high heels with it

14:12.200 --> 14:15.909
and Mother Alice made me practise
walking up and down in them

14:16.000 --> 14:17.194
until I had blisters.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.198
And this one's mine.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.039
It was almost thrown out

14:21.120 --> 14:23.918
because there was
silver embroidery on the sleeves.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.798
In the end,
I had to unpick every stitch.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.470
I felt rather sorry for the bride
that donated it.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.553
I was quite sad when I was told
I'd be making my vows in my habit.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.950
I hadn't realised the Order
had given up the custom until then.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.873
Sister, the expression on your face

14:40.960 --> 14:43.599
was worth a thousand frills
and folderols.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.880
And I don't mind telling you,

14:45.960 --> 14:50.158
I felt like an absolute sideshow
in my big white frock.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.357
I'm sure you looked lovely.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.720
But I was just
a load of nonsense. I'd...

14:55.800 --> 14:58.678
I'd never had any dreams
of a wedding day.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.990
I had, once upon a time.
And I think my mother had, too.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.150
Which is mostly sad for her.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.715
Is this one yours, Sister Evangelina?

15:09.800 --> 15:10.800
Oh!

15:11.200 --> 15:15.557
If there's enough crepe de Chine in it
to make a parachute, yeah, it must be.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.475
Thine,

15:18.480 --> 15:20.118
and mine also.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.549
Though I was tall, and needed
no heels to boost my height.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.279
Oh, Sister. Really?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.271
"We have desired to go."

15:30.040 --> 15:31.951
"Where springs not fail."

15:33.160 --> 15:36.709
"To fields where flies
no sharp and sided hail."

15:38.360 --> 15:40.316
"And a few lilies blow."

15:42.000 --> 15:46.312
And on that note, may I suggest
we put on some milk for the Horlicks?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.554
Sister Evangelina,

15:55.040 --> 15:56.837
I've just been called out
to Tripti Valluk

15:57.000 --> 15:59.719
and, er, I'm slightly nervous
about going on my own.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.589
- Whatever for?
- The family's housing is so poor.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.355
The only tap's outside,
and I know the toilet's broken,

16:07.440 --> 16:09.016
and even with my little bits of Sylheti,

16:09.040 --> 16:12.430
there'll be communication problems
with anyone other than Tripti herself.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.476
"Little bits of Sylheti"?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.358
I've been picking words up

16:16.440 --> 16:18.829
and writing them down
phonetically when I can.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.468
You don't often remind me
of myself when young.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.114
You're too disorganised and too slim.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.234
But I remember teaching myself
some words of Yiddish

16:28.320 --> 16:30.356
when I first came to Poplar.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.117
- And...
- What does that mean?

16:36.560 --> 16:40.235
"I can see Baby's head,"
and, "We're almost there!"

16:41.040 --> 16:43.429
Welcome words to any mother
after a hard labour,

16:43.520 --> 16:46.751
but I reckon they deserve
to hear them in their own language.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.315
Get your bag, I'm coming with you.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.790
But you're the midwife, mind.
I'm just there to do the donkey work.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.269
Fred, this front tyre
is as soft as butter.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.112
I told you last week, yesterday,
and I'm telling you now.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.336
Well, I keep pumping it up.
I dunno what's the matter with it.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.272
How about something beginning with "P"
and ending in "uncture"?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.588
Sister Evangelina...

17:12.680 --> 17:16.832
I can't stand here lecturing you
in rudimentary engineering.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.434
Nurse Gilbert has a patient waiting.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.278
Oh! Whose dinner's this supposed to be?

17:28.359 --> 17:30.510
Ah, Muna must have
prepared it for later.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.390
After the birth, Tripti and her baby
will go into a period of seclusion,

17:34.480 --> 17:36.277
where they'll just rest
and not see anyone,

17:36.360 --> 17:38.715
including her husband, for a while.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.597
Can't fault that arrangement.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.958
At home, in Sylhet, women sleep on floor
for one week after Baby comes.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.793
Here, there is no space on floor.
Room too small.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.399
Too many unwelcome visitors,
if you ask me.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.755
Oh! Have you got any soap, Mrs Valluk?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.434
Fairy, Lifebuoy. Anything will do.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.910
Yesterday, I cleaned everything.
All of room.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.519
You may start feeling the urge

18:07.600 --> 18:09.079
to push soon, Tripti.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.072
Sunlight. That'll do.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.936
Do you want to unpack the gas and air,

18:23.960 --> 18:25.996
just in case we need it
for the final stretch?

18:26.720 --> 18:29.029
In my view, Nurse,
if mother's doing well,

18:29.120 --> 18:33.238
you don't wanna upset the apple cart
by waving it under her nose.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.111
Erm, I'll go down to the tap,
fill the bucket.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.515
The placenta will come soon, Tripti.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.399
It's only been half an hour
and it can take up to an hour.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.109
This water's perfect for Baby's bath.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.519
Oh, we can't keep feeding the meter
just to keep it on the simmer.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.034
We've got candles
for if the gas runs out,

19:31.120 --> 19:34.476
but would you be able to bath Baby now,
Sister Evangelina?

19:34.560 --> 19:37.120
No! You know
I don't handle newborns any more.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.031
I made a rule and I'm sticking by it.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.271
But this room isn't very warm
and the water may go cold

19:42.360 --> 19:45.796
while I wait with Tripti,
and we may put off cleaning Baby.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.073
It would be very helpful
if you stepped in.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.234
Oh!

19:54.640 --> 19:58.428
I think this young lady
has been here before.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.959
Ooh, maybe not in this continent,

20:02.760 --> 20:07.072
maybe not in weather like this,
but she's been here.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.238
Come on, little girl.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.400
That's it.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.478
I hope your mummy's got some vests

20:20.240 --> 20:23.550
for you to wear
underneath your pretty clothes.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.313
Go and see to Mother, Nurse Gilbert.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.675
Baby and I are getting along

20:36.880 --> 20:38.552
just fine.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.629
Yes.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.912
Would you like some tea and toast,
Sister Evangelina?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.514
I reckon we've earned more than toast.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.832
There's half a chocolate button cake
in a tin in the bottom cupboard.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.798
Have a look at the back
behind the All-Bran.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.236
Oh. There's none left.

21:07.040 --> 21:12.114
I fear our noble friends, the rats,
must've been there in advance of us.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.034
Oh, yes, those special rats
that can open tins

21:16.120 --> 21:18.395
and only live in convent kitchens.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.480
Oh!

21:20.360 --> 21:21.873
Cocoa-flavoured buttercream.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.355
And a rogue splinter
of chocolate button.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.829
You are slipping up, Sister.
You missed a bit.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.919
I... I chanced upon some water biscuits.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.431
They have no lure for rats.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.279
Do you still want a cup of tea?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.511
Suppose I shall have to settle for one,

21:37.600 --> 21:40.717
seeing as it's the only sustenance
I'm gonna get.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.189
I'll bring it over.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.189
Here you are, Sister.
Keep the chill off you while you wait.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.233
Thank you.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.070
Morning, Sister. Brr!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.399
Can't say I blame ya.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.995
I love a sit-down before breakfast.
That's if I can get one.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.877
Best bit of the day.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.398
Especially if I nod off and wake up
to the smell of my Violet frying bacon.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.591
Oh! Sorry!

23:07.960 --> 23:09.359
Sister Evangelina?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.394
Oh, no.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.993
- Look!
- What's this?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.672
Have you given any more thought

24:00.760 --> 24:02.910
to buying Angela a doll's pram
for her birthday?

24:03.000 --> 24:06.390
She always makes such a beeline
for the one at the community centre.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.358
Why spend all that money
when she seems perfectly happy

24:09.440 --> 24:11.715
with a basket of sticks and pine cones?

24:14.200 --> 24:16.475
Ah, just in time for some bacon.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.798
Where's your scarf?

24:19.360 --> 24:22.079
It's a school scarf,
so I wear it on school days,

24:22.160 --> 24:23.878
- and today's a Saturday.
- Ah!

24:23.960 --> 24:26.554
Which means we get
our copy of <i>The Lancet.</i>

24:26.640 --> 24:30.519
Mr Miller sent you a copy
of the <i>Exchange and Mart</i> as well today.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.716
I asked him if it was a mistake,
but he said no.

24:32.800 --> 24:33.869
It isn't.

24:33.960 --> 24:37.316
We're going to be looking
at the doll's pram section.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.154
Ooh, thank you. What a lovely house.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.796
Dad! She understands everything we say.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.599
Patrick, you're needed.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.118
At Nonnatus House.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.469
I would put money on another stroke.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.156
A massive bleed to her brain
that took her while she slept.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.028
But she hadn't seen you, or any doctor,
since she came back to Poplar.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.236
Will there have to be a post-mortem?

25:24.320 --> 25:25.753
It's a sudden death.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.391
I will have to inform the coroner.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.994
You shall not take her from this place.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.638
Sister Monica Joan.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.589
Dr Turner has to inform the authorities.
He has no choice,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.791
and no say in what is ordered.

25:38.960 --> 25:43.670
The Lord Himself assured us
of the resurrection of the body.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.951
How is our Sister to rise again,

25:49.240 --> 25:52.550
if her earthly form is not intact?

25:53.920 --> 25:56.798
She will need eyes to see,

25:57.600 --> 25:59.352
a brain to think,

26:01.520 --> 26:03.238
a heart to love.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.989
If you mutilate her now,

26:08.680 --> 26:11.831
you maim her for eternity.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.879
Oh, my dear.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.310
We cannot address this now.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.198
You and I will join our Sisters
in the chapel and we will pray

26:24.960 --> 26:28.032
when we have attended
to all that is essential.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.633
Do you suggest

26:30.480 --> 26:32.675
that prayer is not essential?

26:33.920 --> 26:36.388
I suggest that prayer can wait.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.955
Whatever must be done on Earth,

26:42.440 --> 26:46.069
we know our Sister is in Heaven.

26:47.440 --> 26:52.150
It is her reward,
and we must not resent or fight it.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.789
I spoke to the coroner's office.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.914
Given her recent stroke
and the impairment she was left with,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.753
it looks as though
we can avoid a post-mortem.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.193
Oh, Patrick...

27:14.920 --> 27:16.319
I'm sorry.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.238
I know how much she meant to you.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.513
To everyone.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.676
Who am I going to spar with now?

27:26.960 --> 27:29.076
I'm not crying about that.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.835
I was, but I decided Sister Evangelina
wouldn't approve,

27:33.920 --> 27:36.832
so I sent Timothy out with Angela,

27:36.920 --> 27:40.435
and went into the surgery
to see to the morning's post.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.517
They're withdrawing Distaval?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.791
With immediate effect.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.832
Babies have been born deformed,
and they think there's a link with it.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.832
This is official?

27:59.640 --> 28:01.198
I... I rang the Board of Health.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.914
I didn't think there'd be anyone
there today, but the line was engaged.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.749
I didn't think that was a good sign.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.876
So I looked in <i>The Lancet.</i>

28:12.480 --> 28:14.277
And there's a letter to the editor.

28:17.080 --> 28:20.117
Thalidomide
from Distillers Biochemicals.

28:20.200 --> 28:24.318
But... But they just say
that there is a possible association

28:24.400 --> 28:26.868
with harmful effects on the foetus.

28:27.560 --> 28:31.599
And it also says there are only
two reports from abroad,

28:31.680 --> 28:33.591
and none from Great Britain.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.311
I don't understand it.

28:36.800 --> 28:41.032
But this letter came, Patrick.
Distaval's being withdrawn.

28:42.560 --> 28:47.350
Shelagh, I have prescribed Distaval
to dozens of patients.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.239
Perhaps scores.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.077
Deformed babies
have been born in our district.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.756
We need to speak to someone.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.038
And... And then we need to act.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.678
I don't think anything's
going to happen just yet, Noelle.

29:08.760 --> 29:12.878
I feel like a bit of a chump
calling you out when there was no need.

29:13.920 --> 29:18.232
If a quick home visit helps you to relax
and look forward to your wedding,

29:18.320 --> 29:19.992
that's all to the good.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.231
It's like being royalty.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.470
Mr Hereward says
that the special licence

29:24.560 --> 29:26.676
came from the Archbishop of Canterbury.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.398
Grand as well as quick.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.352
Is that your outfit?

29:32.440 --> 29:34.431
I brought the maternity dress from home

29:34.520 --> 29:36.476
and Tessie took charge
of the accessories.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.790
We tried and tried
to find me a proper gown,

29:38.880 --> 29:42.190
but all the dressmakers
were busy and, well,

29:42.280 --> 29:45.078
I'm not gonna get anything
off the peg in my condition, am I?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.759
Perhaps not.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.636
But I love the colours,

29:49.960 --> 29:52.155
and Tessie certainly
knows how to pick a hat.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.468
It's just not very bridal.

29:57.280 --> 30:00.590
It's not like I thought it would be
when I was little and used to run round

30:00.680 --> 30:04.309
with one of Mum's lace curtains
on my head on a wash day.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.678
She used to say she couldn't
wait to see me all in white.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.191
You'll still look beautiful, Noelle.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.354
But will I feel like a bride?

30:20.440 --> 30:22.237
No, I won't call back later.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.039
I'm quite content
to remain on hold, thank you.

30:26.960 --> 30:30.111
Patrick, you don't know
how the filing system works.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.988
Leave it alone, or come and hold
the telephone instead of me.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.593
<i>- Hold the line, caller.</i>
- Very well.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.156
News travels so quickly.

31:09.440 --> 31:12.193
Forget-Me-Not Lane Florists
just telephoned

31:12.600 --> 31:15.194
and offered to provide
the wreath of our choice for her,

31:15.280 --> 31:16.315
free of charge.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.950
But our vow of poverty
was so very important to her.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.589
Everything she ever had,
she tried to give away.

31:27.360 --> 31:31.319
I thought of that when I was looking
at Noelle's wedding outfit.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.078
It was as though I heard
Sister Evangelina's voice.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.154
Really?

31:37.960 --> 31:41.873
Clearly as I hear God's when
something deep and precious happens.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.397
And as clearly as I ever heard hers
when she was telling me off.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.390
Which happened quite often
over the years.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.311
It happened to me, too.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.194
But this time, she was saying,

31:54.880 --> 31:57.599
"Poor girl! All the way from Australia."

31:57.960 --> 32:01.873
"Tessie Anselm as a mother-in-law,
and no proper wedding dress!"

32:02.360 --> 32:04.032
"Give her mine, for pity's sake."

32:08.720 --> 32:09.914
Well...

32:10.440 --> 32:13.238
Now's not the time
to start arguing with her, is it?

32:13.320 --> 32:14.514
- No.
- Is it?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.359
Nonnatus House.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.396
Sister, I'm afraid I have to ask you
to come to the surgery as soon you can.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.274
Is it to do with
the coroner's arrangements?

32:41.840 --> 32:42.840
No.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.640
I thought you might like a cuppa, Fred.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.475
- It's well-sugared.
- Thank you.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.310
I'm all right, I just, er...

33:30.920 --> 33:33.798
I didn't know what to do.
So I thought I'd come and do this.

33:34.120 --> 33:36.554
Well, I'm sure Sister Evangelina
would be grateful, Fred.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.550
No, she wouldn't.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.476
She never once said thank you
in 18 years of bicycle maintenance.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.071
Ah, she was a grafter,

33:50.320 --> 33:53.278
and grafters don't waste time
on pleasantries.

33:54.800 --> 33:59.237
I'm just doing what she would've done,
if the shoe was on the other foot.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.871
I'm just doing what I do.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.228
Well, somebody's fudging something,
if you ask me.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.072
There must've been more than
just one or two cases!

34:16.159 --> 34:19.197
And pound to a penny,
there's been some in this country.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.713
What about Baby Cottingham?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.512
The limbless baby
that died in St Cuthbert's.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.518
Ruby, the child's mother,
was one of our patients.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.389
I was with Ruby when she was in labour.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.670
When the baby was finally born,

34:33.120 --> 34:35.918
in theatre, the surgeon said,

34:37.000 --> 34:38.831
"Oh, my God. Another one!"

34:39.639 --> 34:41.152
The Officer for Health

34:41.239 --> 34:44.596
told us that the drug
was banned in Germany last week.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.715
It's called Contergan over there,
but it's the same drug.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.353
Thalidomide.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.275
The first thing we thought of
was little Susan Mullucks.

34:54.600 --> 34:58.388
But her mother was never
prescribed Distaval until last week.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.995
We can't be sure
that there's any connection at all

35:01.080 --> 35:02.399
until we find out more.

35:02.480 --> 35:06.189
Well, never mind finding out more!
Get the tablets she has got off her.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.556
Who's to say she won't conceive again
and keep on taking them?

35:09.640 --> 35:12.552
Doctor, there must be dozens of women,

35:12.640 --> 35:15.996
pregnant and otherwise,
who have been prescribed this.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.237
Yes. By me.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.396
- I don't know how to put it right.
- Patrick, sit down.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.836
Sister, go back to Nonnatus House.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.870
You've things to see to there
that no-one else can do.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.076
And send me Nurse Mount.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.709
She's a champion Rolodexer
and she stays calm under fire.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.839
Doctor, you're not to blame.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.713
Oh, I will be,

35:45.720 --> 35:48.234
if one more woman,
pregnant or otherwise,

35:48.320 --> 35:51.949
swallows one more of those vile pills.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.874
We brought nothing into this world...

35:57.960 --> 36:00.997
And it is certain
that we can carry nothing out.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.197
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.991
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.392
Blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.075
Yea, saith the Spirit,
for they rest from their labours.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.517
The undertaker's arrived.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.550
I just don't understand it.

37:33.880 --> 37:37.077
We now have a list of seven women
who were given Distaval

37:37.160 --> 37:40.357
specifically to help with
intractable morning sickness,

37:40.440 --> 37:43.238
but they all gave birth
to normal, healthy babies.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.589
Are you sure?

37:44.680 --> 37:48.798
They were all taking it from
as early as nine weeks into pregnancy.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.231
But none of them started
sooner than October of last year,

37:52.320 --> 37:55.949
and prior to that, it was only ever
prescribed as a sedative.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.917
What about Jeffrey Gallagher's mother?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.716
He was the little chap
born without thumbs.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.030
The Gallaghers left the district.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.998
They went to live in Haverhill,
in Suffolk.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.393
I've got a positive for Ruby Cottingham.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
She's had it recently,

38:15.120 --> 38:18.112
but she wasn't prescribed it
during pregnancy.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.796
Then I looked further back.

38:21.280 --> 38:25.432
Her husband was away at sea
and she had three little lads underfoot.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.639
Dr Turner diagnosed her with anxiety,
leading to sleeplessness.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.799
I'm sorry.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.109
She must've had some left.
Kept them in the cupboard.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.073
People do.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.836
- Turner speaking.
<i>- Turner, it's Jacques here.</i>

38:43.920 --> 38:45.956
- Oh, Dr Jacques?
<i>- You rang for me earlier?</i>

38:46.040 --> 38:48.634
Yes, yes, it's good of you
to take my call.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.678
<i>We've got work to do.
I think we're all in the same boat.</i>

38:51.760 --> 38:52.829
Yes.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.717
You're sure you want her
to be at rest here, Sister?

38:57.800 --> 39:00.598
There'll be so many
wanting to pay their respects.

39:01.040 --> 39:07.275
The thing is, we East End people
see Sister Evangelina as one of our own.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.674
I know.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.676
She's one of our own, too.

39:14.120 --> 39:18.033
And I'm not sure we can spare her yet.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.673
If you would grant us
the honour, Sister,

39:24.480 --> 39:27.711
Crellin and Sons
would like to take care of everything.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.711
The coffin, the hearse,

39:30.240 --> 39:32.595
the burial place, the headstone.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.078
Oh, there will be no charge.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.838
No charge at all?

39:41.160 --> 39:44.152
I was born two months
before I should've been,

39:44.720 --> 39:46.915
and I nearly killed me mother.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.638
Sister Evangelina
bathed me in olive oil,

39:51.480 --> 39:53.357
wrapped me up in lint,

39:57.920 --> 40:00.559
and sat by me mum's bed for seven days.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.155
She never took a penny piece.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.710
And now it's time for me
to pay back what I owe.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.550
Rhoda Mullucks' sister, Ava,

40:17.640 --> 40:20.359
left Poplar two years ago
and moved to Harlow.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.599
Dr Jacques prescribed Distaval for her,

40:24.840 --> 40:27.400
for insomnia, shortly afterwards.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.956
She would've had the tablets
in supply 18 months ago,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.758
round about the time
that Susan was conceived.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.388
So we write
to Jeffrey Gallagher's GP,

40:39.880 --> 40:42.917
warn of the possible connection
to his missing thumbs.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.598
And we ask Rhoda Mullucks
if she took her sister's tablets.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.712
And we tell Ruby Cottingham
why her baby died.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.678
I think Sister Julienne
will want to do that.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.229
Yes.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.439
Mr Tunnicliffe?

41:03.520 --> 41:05.158
- Yeah?
- May I speak to your wife?

41:05.240 --> 41:07.834
It's regarding a problem
with her prescription medication.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.875
I must take them, I'm afraid, Mrs Jones.
Even if there are just two remaining.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.395
Mrs Michaels?

41:55.720 --> 41:59.076
Prescription patients have been
passing Distaval around

41:59.160 --> 42:01.435
as if they were nuts at a party.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.594
I've knocked
at Rhoda Mullucks' house twice.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.599
There's no-one in,

42:06.680 --> 42:08.440
and neighbours don't know
where they've gone.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.713
Mrs Cottingham,

42:26.080 --> 42:28.719
last time I saw you,
I was in the hospital.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.309
Called me Ruby then.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.235
Ruby.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.273
Your eldest boy told me
where I might find you.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.310
I'd stay home more,
but can't stand the noise of 'em.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.839
Boys can be a trial.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.197
I wanted that little girl
so much, Sister.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.469
I know.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.549
I thought if I gave her a name,
might help her go away.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.355
That if I made her into someone,
I could forget her. But...

43:01.400 --> 43:04.358
Can't... Can't forget someone
you never knew.

43:07.320 --> 43:11.518
And the names I do try and give her
just blow round my head like leaves

43:11.600 --> 43:13.158
or bits of feathers.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.551
Some days she's Amanda.

43:17.640 --> 43:19.517
Some days she's Janine.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.188
Or Rose.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.996
They're all beautiful names, Ruby.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.513
I can't catch her.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.998
Can't pin her down.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.757
Ruby, I came because...

43:35.360 --> 43:38.318
Because it seems
there's some new information

43:38.760 --> 43:43.311
which might help us to understand
why your little girl

43:44.360 --> 43:46.078
was born so poorly.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.270
She was poorly, weren't she?

43:50.640 --> 43:51.914
You saw.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.349
I did.

43:57.240 --> 44:02.872
It seems possible that you may have
inadvertently taken some medication

44:02.960 --> 44:06.270
whilst you were expecting her
that caused a lot of damage.

44:08.040 --> 44:10.315
What does "inadvertently" mean?

44:11.400 --> 44:13.630
It means it wasn't your fault.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.795
The medication is called Distaval

44:18.040 --> 44:20.190
and it's being withdrawn from sale.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.518
You'll be wanting these, then.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.629
Yes.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.270
Can I just take one last one?

44:50.440 --> 44:52.510
Look, I'm all done
with the iron if you want it.

44:53.120 --> 44:56.112
It's this hat that's giving me
the run-around.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.919
I've not had it out of its box
since I buried Mother.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.029
I just thought I'd get ahead with mine.

45:02.120 --> 45:05.556
I'm first on call and if I'm called out,
I may not get a chance.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.680
Didn't you want to go out
with the others?

45:08.080 --> 45:10.150
Not to the Hand and Shears.

45:10.480 --> 45:13.153
I really didn't fancy
a complexion-ruining evening

45:13.240 --> 45:15.196
of orange squash and pork scratchings.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.557
I can't say I blame you.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.033
But please don't offer me
a cup of Horlicks.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.754
If you do, I might burst into tears.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.716
God love you, but you look lonely.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.719
I'm so sorry.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.438
Oh!

45:44.520 --> 45:46.988
And you didn't even offer me
any Horlicks.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.510
You know what I like about you, lass?

45:50.600 --> 45:51.794
You're a trier.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.077
And if there's any justice in the world,
you'll get your reward.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.039
I hope so.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.438
But it doesn't have to be a man,
Nurse Crane.

46:04.240 --> 46:07.596
It's not actually the lack of a man
that bothers me.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.033
When I see Tom and Barbara together now,

46:11.440 --> 46:14.830
I don't see what I might've had,
I see what they have.

46:16.400 --> 46:20.029
They belong somewhere,
and they're contented.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.996
I can't tell you how much
I'd love to feel like that.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.750
But it doesn't have to be
because of a man.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.072
It really doesn't.

46:32.800 --> 46:33.994
Trixie.

46:34.640 --> 46:38.474
There are some women who make
a very decent fist of being spinsters.

46:39.120 --> 46:41.190
I like to think I'm one of them,

46:41.280 --> 46:45.239
and if we sidestep the small detail
of her marriage to Jesus,

46:46.240 --> 46:48.231
so was Sister Evangelina.

46:49.480 --> 46:50.993
But you aren't.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.633
And there's no use pretending otherwise.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.355
No.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.348
Come on. Iron your funeral outfit.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.310
Let's see what
Father Christmas brings you.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.474
No nun's gone
in Sister Evangelina's wedding dress.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.919
You'll have to hold it lower than that.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.353
No, lower.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.910
You'll be glad you did
when the photographs come out.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.594
You'll be glad you wore white and all.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.398
You look a picture.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.596
I just wanted to see her.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.676
Before the crowds come in.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.638
Of course you do.

47:49.320 --> 47:51.390
I wanted to see her myself.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.078
I used to be so terrified of her.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.194
Me, too.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.873
And I'm generally not
the terrified type.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.630
But she taught me so much.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.194
Me, too.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.955
I don't know why you don't
move in with your Auntie Blod,

48:36.640 --> 48:39.757
and save on all that rent
you're paying in the convent.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.592
If I decide to train as a midwife,

48:42.040 --> 48:44.474
I have to live in
hospital-approved accommodation.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.512
East Finchley will be too far away.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.920
What do you mean, train as a midwife?

48:50.320 --> 48:55.189
You don't wanna be doing
such a nasty, personal sort of job.

48:56.440 --> 48:57.668
I do it.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.079
I know you do.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.109
You two are as thick as thieves.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.517
And this butter is too cold
for these teacakes.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.118
Mrs Busby, would you give Delia
her birth certificate?

49:19.440 --> 49:20.668
What for?

49:20.760 --> 49:22.751
So she can book herself
onto this training course?

49:23.760 --> 49:25.751
No. So she can apply for a passport.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.993
Because she isn't going to Pembrokeshire
for her holiday next spring.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.910
She's coming to Paris with me.

49:41.760 --> 49:44.149
I'm not an unsophisticated woman.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.112
I've been to Jersey.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.479
And the Isle of Man.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.352
You always did things your own way.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.310
I can bear it if you upset me.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.599
I'm your mum,

50:08.360 --> 50:09.918
and you're a grown woman.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.678
Thank you, Mrs Busby.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.872
Just don't do anything
to make your dad cry.

50:46.240 --> 50:50.199
Congratulations, darling.
I feel like I can breathe out now.

50:50.840 --> 50:53.752
I don't. I reckon I need a lie-down.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.313
I kept hoping
it would all just fizzle out.

51:07.400 --> 51:09.914
But I tried that when I first found out
I was in the family way

51:10.000 --> 51:12.833
and it didn't work then, either.

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
Oh!

51:20.400 --> 51:22.038
Mr Hereward!

51:22.640 --> 51:25.950
You know where the phone is.
Go and ring Nonnatus House!

51:28.440 --> 51:31.238
I just don't think we should
push our way to the front of the queue.

51:31.320 --> 51:34.039
It's exactly the kind of thing
Sister Evangelina wouldn't like.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.635
She wouldn't like me wasting time
when I could be at work, either.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.314
Or you making yourself late for Scouts.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.039
Mrs Turner?

51:43.640 --> 51:46.108
We went to the seaside at the weekend.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.998
It was a bit blowy,
but it did us all good.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.112
Including Susan.

51:51.720 --> 51:54.154
And then I heard the news.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.394
The news?

51:57.080 --> 51:59.116
About Sister Evangelina.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.520
Oh.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.190
You're saying I took a pill?

52:05.320 --> 52:08.278
Just one pill could do this to my baby?

52:08.880 --> 52:11.713
- How many did you take, Rhoda?
- I don't know!

52:12.120 --> 52:16.352
My sister gave me some in an envelope.
She said they'd help me sleep.

52:16.520 --> 52:19.353
Better than a gin, she said.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.398
And I don't have gin in,
we're on a budget!

52:23.360 --> 52:24.918
I dunno how many I took!

52:25.000 --> 52:28.629
Rhoda. Rhoda, nobody knows
for sure what's happened.

52:29.080 --> 52:32.197
But nobody's going to rest
until questions have been answered.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.191
What sort of questions?

52:35.280 --> 52:37.953
"Why did you take 'em, Rhoda?"

52:40.000 --> 52:42.116
"Why didn't you just get on with it?"

52:42.200 --> 52:46.079
"Why'd you have to have a stupid pill
to make you happy all the time?"

52:46.160 --> 52:49.357
You are not to blame, Rhoda.
I promise you.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.072
Oh!

52:53.720 --> 52:56.712
Bernie's taken to calling her
"my beautiful."

52:59.600 --> 53:03.388
I first heard him say that
when she was about four months old.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.556
And I thought, "That's it",

53:06.320 --> 53:08.311
"we're gonna be all right."

53:08.680 --> 53:12.195
Susan's gonna be all right,
because her daddy loves her.

53:13.200 --> 53:16.158
And then, the very next day,

53:16.600 --> 53:20.878
some mate of his from work crossed over
the street because he saw us coming,

53:22.640 --> 53:26.519
and I never heard him say "beautiful"
again for ever such a long time.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.313
And then yesterday at the seaside...

53:34.680 --> 53:37.638
Bernie would've been the one
to cross over once.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.031
Maybe I would've, too.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.033
But he can't.

53:43.680 --> 53:46.672
I can't. Not now. Because she's ours.

53:50.960 --> 53:54.157
I'm sorry, Susan.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.913
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.718
Come on, Noelle! That's it!

54:01.800 --> 54:04.678
Why's it taking so long?

54:04.920 --> 54:07.150
It isn't. I promise you, it isn't.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.112
Come on.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.872
- It's a little boy, Noelle.
- Oh, he's beautiful.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.679
And that dress is ruined.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.629
That dress just had
the best day of its life.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.029
- It's a boy, Mitchell!
- Oh!

55:12.640 --> 55:13.709
Oh...

55:15.600 --> 55:16.600
Oh!

55:26.440 --> 55:30.513
<i>None of us know
how long the things we love will last.</i>

55:31.160 --> 55:33.913
People are lining the route
all the way to the church, Sister.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.160
I've stopped the traffic
as far as the Commercial Road.

55:36.520 --> 55:37.520
Thank you.

55:37.720 --> 55:40.320
It's the least we can do if we
aren't allowed to give her flowers.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.909
The coffin does look so very bare.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.951
<i>Sister Evangelina went to her rest</i>

55:47.040 --> 55:48.917
<i>surrounded by her colleagues</i>

55:49.000 --> 55:51.639
<i>and mourned by people she had nursed,</i>

55:51.720 --> 55:56.510
<i>wheeled through streets imprinted
with her footsteps and her faith.</i>

55:58.840 --> 56:03.231
They mark her spirit
as well as any bloom,

56:05.040 --> 56:07.315
and deserve their rest as much as she.

57:37.640 --> 57:40.074
<i>If she was looking down that day,</i>

57:40.160 --> 57:43.789
<i>she would've been surprised
to see she was no longer there,</i>

57:43.880 --> 57:47.634
<i>and vexed that service
had come to a standstill.</i>

57:48.200 --> 57:50.668
<i>The world was hers no longer,</i>

57:51.280 --> 57:53.555
<i>and she wanted no memorial.</i>

57:53.640 --> 57:55.596
<i>But her work carried on</i>

57:55.680 --> 57:58.513
<i>in the love that lived beyond her,</i>

57:58.600 --> 58:00.716
<i>and the hope that knew no end.</i>
