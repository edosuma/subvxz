Flattening the

Squeezing those ab muscles.

But pilates, I feel like I'm
finally moving the needle

02:25.629 --> 02:26.887
To burning off
these love handles.

02:27.039 --> 02:27.888
You know what I mean?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.481
- I do.

02:29.708 --> 02:30.649
- [barbara] ugh, now I
just need to do something

02:30.800 --> 02:32.209
About all these
lines on my face.

02:32.302 --> 02:34.211
I say, bring me the botox.

02:34.229 --> 02:36.155
- I'm happy, you're
enjoying class, barbara.

02:37.383 --> 02:41.568
- Mm, he is like a greek god.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.569
- Do you know him?

02:42.721 --> 02:44.237
- Mm-hm, that's pierce dalton.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.998
He owns handsworth media corp,

02:47.559 --> 02:49.168
The largest online
and print news company

02:49.319 --> 02:50.818
In the entire state.

02:50.913 --> 02:52.820
- I think I've heard of him.

02:52.915 --> 02:56.491
- Well, I refer to him as the
trifecta because he is smart,

02:56.585 --> 02:58.919
Rich and handsome as hell.

02:59.071 --> 03:00.253
Oh, and rumor has it,

03:00.406 --> 03:03.182
He is an absolute
tiger in the bedroom.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.685
All I have to say is if
I were to have an affair,

03:06.912 --> 03:09.671
Which I never would,
but if I were,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.857
Pierce dalton is my kryptonite.

03:12.008 --> 03:13.767
Ah, pierce.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.176
- Barb.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.696
(lips smacking)

03:17.847 --> 03:21.274
- I trust that you got
the invite to my party.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.350
- I did.

03:22.444 --> 03:25.370
- Oh, I didn't get an rsvp.

03:25.597 --> 03:27.614
Oh my gosh, you need
to come to our party.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.857
It is the perfect
place to meet everyone.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.526
- Ah, okay, sure.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.953
- Shoot, this is my daughter.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.287
I've gotta run.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.775
Okay, pierce, what
can I put you down as?

03:38.868 --> 03:40.794
- Um, still thinking on it.

03:40.946 --> 03:43.805
- Mm-hm, and you, I'm gonna
email you your invite, pronto.

03:44.874 --> 03:45.557
- Bye, barb.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.480
- Pierce dalton.

03:53.308 --> 03:54.900
That was a great class.

03:55.127 --> 03:56.551
- Thanks.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.070
- And nice work on advertising.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.822
It's the, it's the man on
the ad that was the hook.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.242
- Misleading?

04:03.469 --> 04:04.910
- I mean, considering
I was the only guy

04:05.061 --> 04:06.745
In the class, maybe,

04:06.972 --> 04:08.580
But it got me in here,
so guess it worked.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.917
When did you open?

04:12.068 --> 04:12.900
- Ah, three weeks ago.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.254
- Oh, and already a full class.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.329
That's impressive.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.589
- Thanks.

04:17.741 --> 04:19.316
- So you're new to town?

04:19.409 --> 04:21.818
- I am, I'm from montreal,

04:21.837 --> 04:23.503
But my dad is originally
from new orleans,

04:23.597 --> 04:26.673
So I feel like no better
time than the present

04:26.825 --> 04:28.675
To explore my american roots.

04:28.827 --> 04:31.103
Florida was calling. (laughs)

04:31.254 --> 04:33.605
- Well, I never met a
canadian I didn't like.

04:33.832 --> 04:36.182
- I'll try and not
ruin that reputation.

04:36.277 --> 04:40.854
- Um, I think I'd like
to get a membership.

04:41.006 --> 04:42.614
- I think I can help with that.

04:44.026 --> 04:46.952
- Cute dog, like his mum.

04:49.865 --> 04:52.874
Emphasis on the word
cute, not, not dog.

04:54.536 --> 04:56.778
- Trust me, I can be a real
bitch when I need to be.

04:56.872 --> 04:59.131
(dalton and amy laughing)

04:59.358 --> 05:01.374
So I'm not set up for
in-store payment yet,

05:01.527 --> 05:03.877
But I can send you a link and
you can fill it out online.

05:04.029 --> 05:05.137
I just need your email.

05:05.288 --> 05:05.887
- [dalton] okay.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.464
- It's nice to meet you, pierce.

05:16.558 --> 05:18.132
I'm amelie, by the way.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.467
Amelie didot.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.379
- A woman who decides
to change lives

05:22.397 --> 05:24.230
Of those around
her for the better,

05:24.383 --> 05:26.066
In spite of her own isolation?

05:26.218 --> 05:27.384
- You've seen the movie.

05:27.477 --> 05:28.568
- It's an oldie but goodie,

05:28.720 --> 05:30.495
And yes, three times.

05:30.722 --> 05:32.814
It remains my favorite
foreign film to date.

05:32.908 --> 05:33.665
- Oddly, mine too.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.168
- See you soon.

05:36.319 --> 05:37.336
- Mm-hm, I hope so.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.919
(amelie chuckles)

05:46.013 --> 05:48.513
(glass banging)

05:49.850 --> 05:51.499
We're closed.

05:51.593 --> 05:52.258
Okay, all right, all right.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.018
Um, one second.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.246
Hi, I'm amelie.

05:56.264 --> 05:57.856
- Oh, thanks, I'm fran.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.507
Don't tell me that I
missed the last class.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.842
- Ah, yeah,
unfortunately, you did.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.527
- Oh, my god.

06:02.679 --> 06:03.862
And, and I just saw that tall
hunk walk out of the class

06:04.013 --> 06:05.422
And I thought to myself,

06:05.440 --> 06:06.848
"that's not a class
that wanna miss."

06:06.867 --> 06:08.441
- Last class is always at four.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.685
- Oh, okay, well, I'll
make it to the next one,

06:10.779 --> 06:12.429
Only if you can promise me

06:12.447 --> 06:13.872
There'll be some more eye
candy like that in there.

06:14.099 --> 06:16.616
- Ooh, I can make
no such promises.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.284
- [fran] damn.

06:18.437 --> 06:19.544
- Is that your car?

06:19.696 --> 06:21.696
- Ah, she is.

06:21.790 --> 06:22.547
- [amelie] stick shift?

06:22.699 --> 06:23.698
- Mm-hm, always.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.609
I learned on it and then I...

06:25.627 --> 06:28.053
- My mom had an old volkswagen
that I used to drive,

06:28.280 --> 06:30.630
And wow, that just brings
back some memories.

06:30.782 --> 06:32.298
- All good, I hope.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.726
- Except for the time johnny
braxton broke up with me

06:34.953 --> 06:37.879
And spilled orange
soda all over my car.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.140
It was the stickiest
mess I ever had.

06:40.292 --> 06:41.808
I could never fully clean it up.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.794
- Men are like little
children with breakups, right?

06:44.813 --> 06:47.130
It's like they want a
little bit of attention

06:47.149 --> 06:50.316
And they just don't know
how to ask for it. (laughs)

06:50.469 --> 06:51.326
Sorry, that was weird.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.821
Pilates, next Monday,
I'll be there,

06:54.973 --> 06:56.139
And I won't be late this time.

06:56.158 --> 06:57.157
- All right, well,
I'll see you there.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.250
- Ciao.
- Bye.

06:59.736 --> 07:02.587
(suspenseful music)

07:10.264 --> 07:11.321
Okay, so I just wanna make sure

07:11.414 --> 07:12.839
That I'm getting this right.

07:12.933 --> 07:17.602
So there's an exterior
camera here and one here.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.346
And then what?

07:20.499 --> 07:21.665
I just download the app on my
phone and activate it later?

07:21.683 --> 07:23.333
- [associate] yes, ma'am.

07:23.426 --> 07:24.350
- [amelie] okay,
thank you so much.

07:24.503 --> 07:25.351
- [associate] take care.

07:25.504 --> 07:27.187
- Lived here nearly 10 years,

07:27.339 --> 07:28.780
Never needed security cameras.

07:28.932 --> 07:30.431
Safe neighborhood.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.266
- It was a free
upgrade with my cable

07:32.286 --> 07:33.860
And my internet subscription.

07:34.012 --> 07:37.180
- That's how they get you,
free for the first six months,

07:37.273 --> 07:39.273
And god knows how
much after that.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.366
I'm margaret, by the way.

07:40.519 --> 07:41.293
- Nice to meet you, margaret.

07:41.444 --> 07:42.627
I'm amelie.

07:42.854 --> 07:45.522
- I live alone, but
I love kids and dogs.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.691
- I don't have any kids,
but I do have a dog.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.542
- And a cute one at that.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.619
I saw you walking him yesterday.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.788
Mine died almost two years ago

07:53.807 --> 07:56.958
And I just never had the
gusto to get another,

07:57.052 --> 07:59.478
So if you ever need anyone
to watch your little fella,

07:59.629 --> 08:00.537
You let me know.

08:00.630 --> 08:01.721
I'm home most of the time.

08:01.873 --> 08:03.297
- I will, thank you, margaret.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.557
It's really nice to meet you.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.391
Have a good day.

08:05.544 --> 08:06.318
- You too, sweetheart.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.821
(gentle music)

08:14.069 --> 08:15.552
- [clerk] okay.

08:15.645 --> 08:19.498
(clerk speaking
foreign language)

08:21.651 --> 08:22.667
- [customer] gracias.

08:22.819 --> 08:23.585
- Good boy.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.895
Hi.
- Welcome, how are you?

08:25.989 --> 08:27.747
- Can I please
get a new dog tag?

08:27.899 --> 08:29.415
- Okay, your address?

08:29.568 --> 08:30.416
- Thank you, right, the address.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.928
The whole point, huh? (laughs)

08:34.348 --> 08:36.765
(buster barks)

08:39.594 --> 08:41.244
Okay, all good.

08:41.263 --> 08:41.937
Thank you.

08:43.415 --> 08:44.022
Buster?

08:46.084 --> 08:47.100
Buster!

08:47.252 --> 08:48.193
I'll be right back.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.027
Buster!

08:50.364 --> 08:52.030
Buster!

08:52.181 --> 08:54.533
(suspenseful music)

08:54.684 --> 08:56.442
This is my number, okay?

08:56.537 --> 08:57.702
I will.

08:57.854 --> 08:58.537
Thank you.

09:00.189 --> 09:03.616
(suspenseful music)

09:03.710 --> 09:06.127
(phone thumps)

09:11.293 --> 09:12.776
(hand knocking)

09:12.869 --> 09:13.969
- You're missing something?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.798
- Oh my god, buster, hi, baby!

09:18.892 --> 09:21.059
Oh my goodness.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.302
How did you?

09:22.396 --> 09:23.377
(buster barks)

09:23.471 --> 09:24.062
(amelie and pierce laughing)

09:24.289 --> 09:25.471
Right.

09:25.624 --> 09:26.881
Hi.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.882
- Yeah, found him
eating an ice cream cone

09:27.901 --> 09:30.143
Over in the park on west first.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.070
Strawberry, I believe, right?

09:32.221 --> 09:34.388
Yeah, so we stopped and
got something healthy

09:34.482 --> 09:37.242
'cause I figured he was sneaking
dessert in before dinner.

09:38.561 --> 09:39.560
- Thank you.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.329
Seriously, you made my night.

09:42.808 --> 09:44.974
I was getting his
dog tied engraved

09:44.993 --> 09:47.327
And I guess he was
exploring the neighborhood.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.996
- Ah, that would be why he
wasn't wearing his collar.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.923
- I'm gonna send you a venmo.

09:52.075 --> 09:52.982
- A reward?

09:53.001 --> 09:54.667
- Yeah, a thousand bucks?

09:54.820 --> 09:56.761
- Look, as much as I think that
buster is worth every penny

09:56.913 --> 09:58.346
And more, I, I can't.

09:59.825 --> 10:01.174
- Your membership,
a year, on me.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.158
- No, no, no.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.493
I just, I can't accept that.

10:03.511 --> 10:04.269
- We insist.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.607
- Something tells me I'm
not gonna win this argument.

10:08.758 --> 10:11.109
- No, not likely. (laughs)

10:12.504 --> 10:14.279
- Okay, how about
some private sessions?

10:14.430 --> 10:16.430
Spread-eagling my legs in
front of a room full of women

10:16.450 --> 10:18.099
Was, dare I say, intimidating.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.359
- Okay, all right, you got it.

10:19.511 --> 10:21.953
As many free privates
as you can handle.

10:22.180 --> 10:22.787
- Deal.

10:26.701 --> 10:29.944
- Text message, someone spotted
buster on west and third.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.463
I guess I should
take the post down.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.690
Wow, it's already 6:30.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.116
- Guessing you skip lunch?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.526
- And breakfast.

10:36.544 --> 10:38.470
- Right, well I'm taking
you for something.

10:38.697 --> 10:41.030
- No, no, no, you
have done enough.

10:41.049 --> 10:42.456
- I'm claiming it as
part of my reward.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.717
Plus, you likely don't
know anywhere to eat

10:44.870 --> 10:45.810
In this town yet, so...

10:47.555 --> 10:50.131
- Something tells me I'm
not gonna win this argument.

10:50.225 --> 10:50.982
- No, not likely.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.487
(soothing music)

11:00.235 --> 11:02.661
Cheese curds, gravy
and french fries.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.222
- Don't forget the
ketchup on top.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.056
- [pierce] that's
what you grew up on?

11:07.150 --> 11:09.084
- Mm-hm, it's my favorite.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.911
It's called poutine.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.248
- Mm, and aside from buster,
I'm assuming no kids?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.174
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.325 --> 11:17.008
- No, never married?

11:19.328 --> 11:20.995
- Divorced.

11:21.089 --> 11:22.681
- Oh, geez, yeah.

11:24.092 --> 11:25.258
See, I can tell by
the look on your face

11:25.410 --> 11:27.427
That that one didn't end well.

11:27.579 --> 11:28.687
- You ask a lot of questions.

11:30.339 --> 11:31.748
- I'm a journalist.

11:31.841 --> 11:32.857
It comes to the territory.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.194
We don't have to talk about it.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.115
- No, it's, it's fine.

11:42.777 --> 11:45.870
He cheated several times,

11:47.766 --> 11:49.040
So yeah, it did not end well.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.286
- Oh, thank you.

11:53.438 --> 11:54.879
- Let me.
- Oh no, no, my treat.

11:58.367 --> 12:02.220
(patrons chattering
indistinctly)

12:02.371 --> 12:03.054
- Thank you.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.643
So what about you?

12:10.379 --> 12:11.813
- Five kids, three
different moms.

12:13.141 --> 12:13.815
- Seriously?

12:15.977 --> 12:18.385
- Sometimes, sometimes,
seriously, yeah.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.295
But no, definitely not that way.

12:19.314 --> 12:20.296
- Okay.

12:20.315 --> 12:20.989
- Never married, no kids.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.390
Had one serious girlfriend once,

12:23.410 --> 12:25.468
But that ended well
over a decade ago.

12:25.487 --> 12:27.153
- [amelie] mm.
- Mm.

12:27.305 --> 12:29.396
Dated someone briefly last year.

12:29.491 --> 12:31.082
That ended with the bang.

12:31.234 --> 12:32.475
- What happened?

12:32.494 --> 12:35.328
- She was intense,
very, very intense.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.171
- How so?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.405
- Well, the first date was fun.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.983
The second date was more fun.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.835
And then the third
date went south.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.504
We were at dinner,

12:44.598 --> 12:47.432
And an old colleague of
mine was there with his wife

12:47.583 --> 12:49.434
And they wanted to join us
for a drink. They came over.

12:49.585 --> 12:51.661
I thought we had a great time,
but at the end of the night,

12:51.679 --> 12:56.441
She was adamant that my
friend's wife was hitting on me,

12:57.260 --> 12:57.942
And I on her.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.595
- Okay, well, were
you, or was she?

13:01.689 --> 13:03.114
- Dolores is 71 years old.

13:03.341 --> 13:04.524
- Okay.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.784
- Yeah, with a serious
bout of chin hairs.

13:05.935 --> 13:07.434
- [amelie] mm.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.028
- She feels like any older lady

13:09.122 --> 13:12.123
Who's been married for 40
years does in compliments,

13:12.275 --> 13:14.608
And I was doing nothing more
than being amused by her.

13:14.702 --> 13:16.185
- She sounds like my mom.

13:16.204 --> 13:18.354
- Yeah, and she's old
enough to be mine, too.

13:18.447 --> 13:20.298
(amelie and pierce laughing)

13:20.449 --> 13:21.282
- So what happened?

13:21.376 --> 13:22.525
You broke it off after that?

13:22.544 --> 13:24.694
- Do you really wanna
hear about this?

13:24.712 --> 13:26.379
Come on.
- Only if you wanna tell me.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.806
- Okay.

13:28.033 --> 13:31.792
Well, we met because
we hired her tech firm

13:31.812 --> 13:33.294
To do some of our
social media stuff.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.221
- Mm-hm, and?

13:35.373 --> 13:37.565
- And she kind of, well,

13:38.893 --> 13:39.651
How do I put this?

13:40.895 --> 13:42.970
Started tracking me online.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.064
Yeah, out of the blue, she
would bring up a tweet I've made

13:45.216 --> 13:46.324
Where I tagged the journalist

13:46.551 --> 13:48.067
Whose story would
published through her,

13:48.219 --> 13:52.914
Retail owner who's
shop we have profiled

13:54.059 --> 13:55.166
In the local business section,

13:55.393 --> 13:57.393
Accusations that I was
flirting with them,

13:57.412 --> 13:59.245
Even though I'd never
met any of them.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.339
The final straw came when
I came back from a run

14:01.490 --> 14:04.825
To find her standing outside
my house, waiting for me.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.678
She looked like she
hadn't slept in a day,

14:06.829 --> 14:08.162
And she flew into a rage

14:08.181 --> 14:10.348
About how I changed
my running route.

14:10.575 --> 14:12.350
- She was monitoring
your jogging routine?

14:12.501 --> 14:14.093
- I have no idea,
didn't ask her,

14:14.245 --> 14:18.940
But to make a long story
short, I cut it off.

14:20.085 --> 14:21.192
It had only been three weeks,

14:21.419 --> 14:22.360
And that was really
long enough to realize

14:22.511 --> 14:23.945
That it was just
never gonna work.

14:27.258 --> 14:27.866
Hm.

14:30.019 --> 14:32.095
(phones chiming)

14:32.113 --> 14:33.020
Hm.

14:33.114 --> 14:33.788
- That's weird.

14:37.193 --> 14:40.103
Barbara, reminder to rsvp.

14:40.121 --> 14:40.795
- Same.

14:42.198 --> 14:43.697
- It's an "eyes
wide shut" theme.

14:43.791 --> 14:45.699
- Yeah, so now you know why
I was hesitating to rsvp.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.276
- God, okay, call
me conservative,

14:47.295 --> 14:49.112
But going to a wild
party in a town

14:49.205 --> 14:50.780
Where I literally
know two people

14:50.798 --> 14:53.966
Just sounds too
adventurous for me.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.210
- Well, why don't you
make it more adventurous

14:56.304 --> 14:57.478
And just come as my date?

14:59.882 --> 15:01.124
- Your date?

15:01.142 --> 15:02.901
- Yeah, promise to
keep my clothes on.

15:03.978 --> 15:05.645
"eyes wide shut" theme.

15:05.739 --> 15:06.553
- Right.

15:06.648 --> 15:07.388
- [pierce] get it?

15:07.482 --> 15:08.314
- Oh, I get it.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.574
- [pierce] okay.

15:11.319 --> 15:12.327
Put your number in there.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.655
What's your favorite song?

15:15.807 --> 15:17.140
- My favorite song?

15:17.233 --> 15:18.917
Something from your top ten.

15:19.144 --> 15:20.567
- Um...

15:20.662 --> 15:21.753
- Oh, I got it.

15:22.905 --> 15:23.813
- Got what?

15:23.831 --> 15:27.150
♪ it's a perfect day ♪

15:27.168 --> 15:28.834

15:28.987 --> 15:29.669

15:29.821 --> 15:31.262
- That's my ring tone?

15:31.414 --> 15:32.505
- In, in my phone, yeah.

15:32.657 --> 15:35.099

15:35.326 --> 15:36.601

15:36.752 --> 15:37.435
- Mm, thanks.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.330
- Giving me a ring tone in
your phone gives you props.

15:41.349 --> 15:42.089
- Does it?

15:42.183 --> 15:43.499
- [amelie] mm-hm.

15:43.518 --> 15:44.850
- Does that mean I'm
picking you up at seven?

15:44.945 --> 15:45.851
- Seven it is.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.467
You look-

16:09.618 --> 16:10.693
- It's too much, I know.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.378
I just didn't have time to-

16:12.530 --> 16:14.714
- [pierce] gorgeous.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.290
- Really?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.049
- Stunningly so.

16:17.143 --> 16:17.809
These of you.

16:19.037 --> 16:20.311
- They're beautiful, thank you.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.983
- Your chariot awaits, my lady.

16:25.134 --> 16:27.485
(upbeat music)

17:01.412 --> 17:04.605
(upbeat music continues)

17:11.865 --> 17:13.531
- [guest] oh, it's
a beautiful party,

17:14.868 --> 17:15.925
And you're a beautiful woman.

17:15.943 --> 17:17.593
- Drinks?

17:17.612 --> 17:18.703
- [guest] oh, my, oh, my.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.099
- Uh, sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.284
- [guest] I can be
anyone you want.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.527
- Uh, that's okay.

17:26.621 --> 17:27.795
Thank you, not tonight.

17:30.032 --> 17:33.534
- [guest] oh, it must
have been my gold mask.

17:33.628 --> 17:36.387
(guests laughing)

17:37.949 --> 17:40.283
- I love what you did,
and we will, absolutely.

17:40.376 --> 17:41.708
- [woman] thank you, pierce.

17:41.803 --> 17:42.727
- [amelie] here you go.

17:43.879 --> 17:44.562
- [pierce] thanks.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.647
Everything okay?

17:48.050 --> 17:49.400
- Everything's fine.

17:49.552 --> 17:51.310
Just saw man that I thought
was you from behind.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.813
- Hm, did he hit on you?

17:53.965 --> 17:55.573
- He did, actually.

17:55.724 --> 17:56.574
- Va-va-voom!

17:58.578 --> 18:00.136
Look at you two.

18:00.154 --> 18:01.487
- Barbara?

18:01.639 --> 18:02.563
- The one and only.

18:02.657 --> 18:03.472
- [amelie] wow.

18:03.491 --> 18:04.807
- Hey, bud.

18:04.826 --> 18:07.643
- Frank, thanks so
much for the invite.

18:07.736 --> 18:09.736
- Are my eyes playing faint

18:09.756 --> 18:12.331
Or did you and pierce
arrive together?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.574
- We did.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.577
- Oof, you lucky, lucky girl.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.671
- Okay, chocolate mint martinis,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.848
How did they warm their
way into the theme?

18:22.918 --> 18:25.995
- Well, dark chocolate is
an aphrodisiac, my dear.

18:26.013 --> 18:27.680
How do you not know that?

18:27.832 --> 18:29.181
- Barbara, I can't
believe you live here.

18:29.334 --> 18:32.276
This place is massive.

18:32.428 --> 18:36.689
- It's way too large for us,
but barbara refuses to move.

18:36.841 --> 18:38.765
- Mm, what can I say?

18:38.785 --> 18:39.534
I like them big.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.287
- Okay.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.514
Do you mind if I
give her the tour?

18:45.608 --> 18:48.868
- Of course, feel
free to wander.

18:48.962 --> 18:49.869
- [pierce] cheers.

18:50.021 --> 18:51.129
- That's the theme of the party.

18:54.192 --> 18:57.635
- This place is, it's
like an art gallery.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.863
- [pierce] appropriate,
wouldn't you say,

19:00.882 --> 19:02.557
For the great granddaughter
of harold gershwin?

19:04.385 --> 19:07.311
- The minimalist
artist of the 1920s?

19:07.463 --> 19:08.629
- [pierce] that's the one.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.722
- Oh, wow, okay,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.983
So these are...

19:13.153 --> 19:14.043
- Very expensive.

19:14.061 --> 19:14.819
- [amelie] hmm.

19:16.047 --> 19:16.904
- Beautiful, isn't it?

19:19.066 --> 19:19.991
- [amelie] yeah, it is.

19:21.569 --> 19:24.069
- What do you think has
transpired between them?

19:24.222 --> 19:26.831
- Oh, art is about perception.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.169
It's in the eye of the
beholder, isn't it?

19:31.396 --> 19:32.912
- It is.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.006
So what would yours be of this?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.093
- An argument, maybe?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.849
He's asked for forgiveness, and,

19:48.504 --> 19:51.189
And, she's given in, again.

19:54.176 --> 19:54.942
What's yours?

19:56.254 --> 19:57.445
What is your perception?

19:58.847 --> 20:03.201
- Well, he's, he's worried.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.704
She's exhausted.

20:09.191 --> 20:10.857
Maybe he saved her.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.794
(melancholy music)

20:19.794 --> 20:24.296
He really hurt you, didn't
he, your ex-husband?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.056
- He did.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.648
Cheating, you know, it
just feels like betrayal.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.721
Over and over
again, he would cry

20:40.740 --> 20:44.075
And pledge he would
never do it again,

20:45.803 --> 20:48.079
And I would forgive him,

20:49.640 --> 20:51.499
Losing a little bit
of myself each time,

20:54.145 --> 20:58.256
My, my self esteem diminishing

20:59.926 --> 21:03.511
Until I didn't even
recognize myself anymore.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.267
I became numb.

21:13.347 --> 21:18.109
No more desire, no
more lust for him.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.280
I, I just was.

21:28.179 --> 21:30.454
The worst part was
that I became someone

21:30.606 --> 21:32.456
Who couldn't even...

21:34.460 --> 21:35.126
- Trust anymore?

21:39.540 --> 21:40.131
- Exactly.

21:42.043 --> 21:44.885
(melancholy music)

21:49.458 --> 21:51.475
- You're beautiful,
amelie didot,

21:53.721 --> 21:54.395
Inside and out.

22:00.394 --> 22:02.987
(lips smacking)

22:04.973 --> 22:06.157
Should we continue the tour?

22:08.386 --> 22:08.993
- Let's.

22:10.312 --> 22:12.413
Is the lady's room that way?

22:13.333 --> 22:14.165
- Yes, it is.

22:17.061 --> 22:18.561
Why don't I grab us
a plate of appetizer

22:18.579 --> 22:20.563
And meet outside in five?

22:20.581 --> 22:21.255
- Perfect.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.509
(gentle music)

22:34.095 --> 22:37.429
(amelie exhales deeply)

22:37.582 --> 22:41.275
(guests chattering indistinctly)

22:45.514 --> 22:46.364
- Oh, sorry.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.701
(ominous music)

23:09.555 --> 23:10.304
- Pierce?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.618
Pierce?

23:15.711 --> 23:17.544
Oh my god, someone help me!

23:17.563 --> 23:19.304
Someone help!

23:19.399 --> 23:21.982
(dramatic music)

23:23.569 --> 23:24.318
- Amelie?

23:25.479 --> 23:26.237
- Pierce?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.907
(barbara crying)

23:30.058 --> 23:32.243
(suspenseful music)

23:38.643 --> 23:42.144
- If you remember anything
else, here's my card.

23:42.163 --> 23:42.878
- Thank you.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.591
(indistinct radio voice)

23:52.432 --> 23:55.007
- [guest] I can be
anyone you want.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.268
- Let's get you home.

23:57.419 --> 24:00.396
(suspenseful music)

24:01.774 --> 24:04.108
- Reach those arms up
to the sky on an inhale,

24:04.259 --> 24:05.926
Straight as a board.

24:06.020 --> 24:08.446
Exhale, bring them down to
your side and curl the spine,

24:08.597 --> 24:11.857
Drawing the navel in as tight
as you can to the spine.

24:12.009 --> 24:13.433
And if that's too hard fran,

24:13.527 --> 24:14.526
You can just bring them right
back down into tabletop.

24:14.679 --> 24:15.286
Nice job.

24:16.847 --> 24:17.771
Good job.

24:17.865 --> 24:19.105
Hold that position.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.792
Belly drawing in
toward the spine.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.463
- I need to talk
to you after class.

24:25.614 --> 24:26.422
- Sure, sure thing.

24:27.541 --> 24:29.692
All right, good job, nice.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.360
Keep those arms straight.

24:31.378 --> 24:33.804
Just 30, more seconds
in this position.

24:33.956 --> 24:36.807
(suspenseful music)

24:42.056 --> 24:43.647
Bye, ladies, good job today.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.485
- Wow, great class.

24:49.046 --> 24:49.803
- You know, I have a
three-for-five promo

24:49.897 --> 24:51.304
Going on right now.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.548
Maybe you wanna
sign up for that?

24:52.566 --> 24:54.550
- I actually saw that
in the newspaper.

24:54.568 --> 24:56.401
- It's good to know all my
advertising is paying off.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.286
- Sure is.

24:58.889 --> 25:00.239
- Are you doing
some construction?

25:00.333 --> 25:03.075
- Oh no, that's just, that's
the little side thing.

25:03.227 --> 25:04.502
I got a project that I'm doing.

25:06.247 --> 25:07.396
- You know, it looks like
your pen exploded in your bag.

25:07.414 --> 25:08.413
- Oh, shoot!

25:08.566 --> 25:10.156
Damn it.

25:10.251 --> 25:12.067
- I destroyed my favorite
satchel with an exploded pen.

25:12.086 --> 25:13.752
It's the worst.

25:13.904 --> 25:15.738
I never carry pens in
my purse after that.

25:15.756 --> 25:16.514
Hey barb.

25:16.665 --> 25:18.182
- I, I've gotta run.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.075
I got a call from my daughter,
but I will call you later.

25:20.094 --> 25:21.519
- Okay, is everything okay?

25:21.746 --> 25:22.353
- It's fine.

25:22.580 --> 25:23.746
- Bye, barb.

25:23.764 --> 25:24.522
- Uh-huh.

25:26.417 --> 25:28.417
- Well, if you
find a plan online,

25:28.510 --> 25:29.935
Just feel free to
sign up for it.

25:30.029 --> 25:30.819
- Sure.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.684
- Uh, I hate to rush
you out the door,

25:37.703 --> 25:40.538
I just, I have a private
session starting soon.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.431
- Oh, you teach
private lessons now?

25:42.449 --> 25:44.950
- Yeah, it's just the
one client right now,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.953
And it's, it's kind of a
pro bono type of thing.

25:48.105 --> 25:48.954
- Really?

25:49.106 --> 25:51.456
- Yeah, my dog ran off,

25:51.609 --> 25:54.868
And, and he actually found him.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.279
This is what he
wanted for the reward.

25:57.298 --> 25:59.372
- It's not the hunk I
saw leaving your class

25:59.466 --> 26:01.541
When I missed it the other day?

26:01.561 --> 26:02.726
- It is, actually.

26:05.973 --> 26:07.398
(picture bangs)

26:07.549 --> 26:09.066
- I'll think about
that membership.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.237
(ominous music)

26:13.388 --> 26:14.530
- Thanks for coming?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.817
(ominous music)

26:18.911 --> 26:23.747
Mm, seriously?

26:24.491 --> 26:26.709
(ominous music)

26:36.670 --> 26:38.337
(hand knocking)

26:38.431 --> 26:40.097
- You all right?

26:40.324 --> 26:42.991
- Yeah, yeah, I
just got this client

26:43.085 --> 26:44.918
Break my picture frame though.

26:45.012 --> 26:46.753
- What do you mean?

26:46.772 --> 26:48.772
- She slammed it down,
breaking the glass.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.166
- That's weird.

26:51.185 --> 26:53.277
- Yeah, just added to
all the other weirdness

26:53.428 --> 26:54.427
Happening as of late.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.613
- [pierce] hmm.

26:55.764 --> 26:56.905
- Guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

26:58.342 --> 27:00.843
Speaking of which, any leads?

27:00.861 --> 27:02.194
- No, not really.

27:02.346 --> 27:04.696
Police are still keeping
the case pretty quiet.

27:04.849 --> 27:05.939
I'm waiting on more information

27:05.958 --> 27:07.683
Before I publish
anything in my paper.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.852
We're working on a pass for now.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.353
- Have you ever covered
a murder before?

27:11.446 --> 27:13.797
- Yes, but not one
in my own backyard.

27:15.117 --> 27:17.042
It's all a little bit bizarre,

27:17.194 --> 27:19.878
Where it was and, you know, you.

27:20.030 --> 27:20.787
- Me?

27:20.806 --> 27:21.597
Ah.
- Oh.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.032
- You know what?

27:24.051 --> 27:25.309
I have band-aids.

27:27.129 --> 27:30.314
- Yeah, you know, just how
you found him and all that.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.319
- It's like a bad dream.

27:36.897 --> 27:38.897
Not too mention, barb wouldn't
even look at me today.

27:39.049 --> 27:40.991
Maybe she feels weird
seeing me because of it.

27:41.143 --> 27:43.402
- No, I doubt that.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.812
I'm sure she just feels
the same as you about it.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.572
After all, it did
happen in her home.

27:47.725 --> 27:48.832
- Yeah.

27:49.059 --> 27:50.150
- I also learned
that the man, brian,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.294
Was a university
friend of frank's,

27:53.655 --> 27:55.005
Probably was quite a good one.

27:55.157 --> 27:57.232
So, you know,

27:57.251 --> 27:59.902
I think everyone's just
feeling little out of sorts.

27:59.995 --> 28:01.403
- Yeah, you're probably right.

28:01.422 --> 28:02.680
- There we are.

28:02.907 --> 28:03.997
Good as new.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.424
- Thanks, doctor.

28:05.576 --> 28:07.518
- Take my advice,
I know it's hard,

28:08.837 --> 28:10.762
Just try and forget about it.

28:10.915 --> 28:13.023
- I'm trying, trust me.

28:15.343 --> 28:16.101
You wanna get started?

28:16.195 --> 28:16.860
- Let's do it.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.198
(smooth music)

28:21.425 --> 28:23.701
(door bangs)

28:28.374 --> 28:29.039
- Perfect.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.376
(smooth music)

28:32.527 --> 28:35.120
- I just wanna make sure your
core is doing all the work.

28:35.272 --> 28:37.047
You shouldn't be feeling
anything in your back.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.201
Old pro, it seems.

28:41.220 --> 28:45.130
- No.

28:45.282 --> 28:46.223
- That's it.

28:46.374 --> 28:47.057
All right.

28:49.453 --> 28:51.711
- Okay, how do I
dismount this thing?

28:51.805 --> 28:52.471
- I believe in you.

28:52.565 --> 28:53.355
- Gratefully.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.402
- Okay, lay down onto your back.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.070
We're gonna do my
favorite, bridges.

29:01.890 --> 29:04.649
Okay, feet pushing the floor,
arms down by your side.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.577
We're gonna inhale, and
one vertebrae at a time,

29:06.804 --> 29:08.820
We're gonna roll up
through our spine, okay?

29:08.973 --> 29:09.580
Inhale.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.991
(smooth music)

29:13.143 --> 29:16.420
(amelie breathing deeply)

29:21.502 --> 29:24.928
Mm-hm, and we're just
gonna pulse at the top.

29:30.919 --> 29:32.585
- [pierce] like this?

29:32.679 --> 29:33.437
- Yeah, just like that.

29:37.017 --> 29:38.166
- I feel ridiculous.

29:38.185 --> 29:39.592
(amelie laughing)

29:39.612 --> 29:40.444
Okay.

29:42.506 --> 29:43.763
There you go, you got it.

29:43.783 --> 29:44.782
- No, I like this.

29:46.434 --> 29:49.102
- (laughs) you do, do you?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.455
Okay, it's close,
but can I show you?

29:51.606 --> 29:52.456
- Sure, yeah.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.960
(seductive music)

30:05.712 --> 30:08.530
- See how I'm squeezing
my butt muscles?

30:08.549 --> 30:10.215
You wanna make sure you're
not feeling anything

30:10.309 --> 30:10.974
In your back.

30:14.538 --> 30:15.220
See?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.480
- Oh, yes I, uh,

30:19.652 --> 30:22.486
Yeah, no, that's,
um, that's helpful.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.658
(seductive music)

30:58.357 --> 31:00.432
(amelie moans)

31:00.584 --> 31:03.694
- And to work both the
buttocks, you hold.

31:15.449 --> 31:17.523
- [delivery man]
hello, delivery.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.268
- [amelie] sorry, I
thought I closed that.

31:20.287 --> 31:22.379
- Nothing to apologize for.

31:22.606 --> 31:24.715
- [amelie] this is
so unprofessional.

31:29.371 --> 31:30.387
I feel ridiculous.

31:31.891 --> 31:32.556
- Ridiculous?

31:34.635 --> 31:36.560
Ridiculous like I can't
get you off my mind?

31:42.459 --> 31:43.475
- You can't?

31:43.627 --> 31:44.234
- No.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.908
- Dinner at my
place Friday night?

31:53.820 --> 31:54.703
- All right.

31:56.323 --> 31:57.581
- Looks like our hour is up.

31:58.566 --> 31:59.750
- I think it is.

32:01.645 --> 32:02.753
- Thanks for a great class.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.593
(melancholy music)

32:15.250 --> 32:17.434
You have an amazing
rest of your day.

32:17.585 --> 32:20.270
- I will, you too.

32:21.923 --> 32:24.499
(melancholy music)

32:24.518 --> 32:26.777
(door bangs)

32:32.117 --> 32:35.202
(car engines whirring)

32:37.014 --> 32:39.790
(suspenseful music)

32:43.611 --> 32:45.870
- Hey, did you see the
draft of the mansion murder?

32:46.023 --> 32:48.023
- Mansion murder, seriously?

32:48.116 --> 32:49.524
- An "eyes wide
shut" theme party

32:49.543 --> 32:52.194
Where a local
entrepreneur was murdered.

32:52.212 --> 32:53.762
- Yes, I get the angle,

32:54.865 --> 32:56.698
But not for this one, okay?

32:56.717 --> 32:57.641
- Okay.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.292
Brian left behind two kids

32:59.311 --> 33:00.143
And a lot of grieving
family members and friends,

33:00.295 --> 33:01.478
Many of whom I know personally,

33:01.629 --> 33:03.146
So we're not gonna
sensationalize this one, okay?

33:03.298 --> 33:06.799
Let's just publish information
confirmed by the police.

33:06.819 --> 33:10.562
- Which I did, but I
will change the headline.

33:10.714 --> 33:12.230
In the meantime, can
you take a look at it?

33:12.382 --> 33:13.898
It's in the online
drafts folder.

33:14.051 --> 33:14.807
- Yep.

33:14.827 --> 33:15.659
Yeah, looking now.

33:16.887 --> 33:17.494
Thanks.

33:18.889 --> 33:21.665
(suspenseful music)

33:25.838 --> 33:27.412
Dale!

33:27.506 --> 33:28.747
- [dale] what?

33:28.841 --> 33:30.915
- What the hell is this?

33:31.068 --> 33:32.250
- What do you mean?

33:32.402 --> 33:33.568
- "sources close to
the investigation say

33:33.587 --> 33:34.919
That amelie didot is
thought to have been

33:35.072 --> 33:37.239
In a romantic relationship
with the deceased.

33:37.257 --> 33:38.740
Didot, a canadian transplant

33:38.759 --> 33:40.925
Is currently under investigation
for running a sex ring."

33:41.078 --> 33:42.260
- Where does it say that?

33:42.412 --> 33:43.928
- "out of her newly-established
pilates studio."

33:44.081 --> 33:45.247
- I didn't write that, boss.

33:45.340 --> 33:46.506
- What do you mean
you didn't write it?

33:46.525 --> 33:47.749
- I mean that I
didn't write that.

33:47.842 --> 33:48.674
I've never seen
that photo before

33:48.769 --> 33:49.651
And I don't even
know who she is.

33:51.255 --> 33:52.420
I think our system's
been hacked, pierce.

33:52.439 --> 33:53.864
- Open your account
now and erase it.

33:54.091 --> 33:55.774
We need it off the system
and change the passcodes.

33:55.926 --> 33:56.608
- I don't know how to
change the passcode.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.201
- Well, call brody in tech.

33:58.353 --> 33:59.661
Do it now!

34:01.540 --> 34:04.524
- I mean, are you doing okay?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.284
- Yes and no.

34:06.436 --> 34:09.954
I guess I just, I can't
believe it happened.

34:10.107 --> 34:11.790
It seemed so unreal.

34:11.884 --> 34:12.716
- I can imagine.

34:14.369 --> 34:16.219
- Hey, I, I don't wanna
make you feel uneasy,

34:17.705 --> 34:19.114
But you know that woman
that you were talking to

34:19.132 --> 34:21.116
After class the other day?

34:21.134 --> 34:23.468
- Ooh, the oddball who
broke my picture frame

34:23.562 --> 34:25.211
And got ink all over my floor.

34:25.305 --> 34:27.064
- She broke your picture frame?

34:27.291 --> 34:29.066
- Yeah, she slammed it
down and smashed it.

34:29.217 --> 34:30.716
It was so weird.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.294
Maybe she was having a bad day.

34:32.387 --> 34:35.054
- Okay, you cannot let
her back in your studio

34:35.148 --> 34:37.223
Or anywhere near
you for that matter.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.224
- Why?

34:38.318 --> 34:40.802
- Amelie, that was pierce's ex.

34:40.821 --> 34:42.654
Does pierce know
that she was there?

34:42.806 --> 34:45.323
- No, she left the studio
before and he came.

34:45.475 --> 34:47.142
- Good.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.734
I am gonna give
you the same advice

34:48.754 --> 34:50.570
That pierce is gonna give you,

34:50.589 --> 34:52.589
You need to keep
her away from you.

34:54.484 --> 34:55.650
- How do you know her?

34:55.743 --> 34:57.427
- I don't, I only
met her in passing.

34:57.579 --> 34:58.820
She and pierce
were at the movies.

34:58.913 --> 35:01.264
I guess they were on
their second date.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.583
The following day, I get
a text message from her

35:03.602 --> 35:05.084
Asking if she wanted to meet up.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.105
- Like, like out of the blue?

35:08.332 --> 35:10.941
- Yeah, so I assumed that
pierce gave her my number

35:11.092 --> 35:13.168
And I felt obligated to
get together with her.

35:13.186 --> 35:17.339
Anyway, we meet for lunch and
she seemed fantastic at first.

35:17.432 --> 35:19.023
You know, she started
even telling me

35:19.176 --> 35:21.284
How sexually compatible
she and pierce were.

35:23.029 --> 35:24.788
I did find it (indistinct).

35:25.015 --> 35:26.531
- Of course.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.701
- And then she starts to dig,
like dig up stuff on pierce.

35:29.853 --> 35:32.963
She even went as far as to ask
if he and I had ever dated.

35:34.782 --> 35:37.259
(upbeat music)

35:40.380 --> 35:42.806
She said, "I couldn't
help but notice

35:43.033 --> 35:46.459
How you kissed him on the
cheek the first time we met."

35:46.478 --> 35:50.038
Uh-huh, and get this, next
time I run into pierce,

35:50.056 --> 35:52.207
He told me he had
to break up with her

35:52.225 --> 35:54.058
Because she was becoming
excessively jealous

35:54.211 --> 35:56.878
To the point of being
obsessed with him.

35:56.971 --> 35:59.305
He also shared with
me he had no idea

35:59.324 --> 36:00.640
That we got together for lunch

36:00.659 --> 36:02.159
Or how she even got my number.

36:03.887 --> 36:07.647
I, I tell you what,
this is just crazy.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.408
I, I saw her there that night.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.836
I swear, I saw her.

36:12.987 --> 36:15.988
By the time I got down to
see her, see if it was her,

36:16.008 --> 36:17.340
She'd taken off into the crowd.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.678
You know, I, I wasn't
worried about it at first,

36:23.089 --> 36:26.257
But if that was her,
she noticed you.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.592
- Noticed me?

36:27.744 --> 36:30.002
- Why do you think she
came to your studio?

36:30.022 --> 36:32.522
Listen, you have
got to be careful.

36:34.084 --> 36:35.341
Ever since my party,

36:35.360 --> 36:37.027
I am thinking the
worst of everyone.

36:38.255 --> 36:41.606
(suspenseful music)

36:41.758 --> 36:43.867
Yeah, let's get out of here.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.022
(car engine whirring)

36:50.116 --> 36:51.208
(barbara speaking indistinctly)

36:51.435 --> 36:52.617
- [amelie] yes, yes,

36:52.711 --> 36:53.618
I'll see you tonight.

36:53.770 --> 36:54.878
I'll see you at the studio.

36:55.029 --> 36:57.214
- [barbara] yeah,
see you in class.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.176
(upbeat music)

37:10.729 --> 37:11.394
- [fran] hey you.

37:14.641 --> 37:19.127
- Hey, what are you
doing over here?

37:19.145 --> 37:21.813
- I was just driving
by, but you need a lift?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.241
- Uh, no, no, nothing,

37:28.138 --> 37:29.804
Um, but I'm, I'm good.

37:29.897 --> 37:30.655
Thank you.

37:30.807 --> 37:31.414
- Okay.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.234
- Do you live around here?

37:35.254 --> 37:38.329
- No, but my favorite pizza
joint does so, you know.

37:38.482 --> 37:40.148
- Right

37:40.166 --> 37:42.333
- Why don't you get in? I'll
totally give you a ride.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.652
- I'm, I'm good, thanks.

37:44.746 --> 37:47.264
Actually, that's my car
share, but thank you.

37:49.083 --> 37:51.101
- I'm literally offering
to save you some money,

37:51.252 --> 37:52.010
Give you a ride.

37:52.162 --> 37:52.769
It's not a big deal.

37:55.015 --> 37:57.107
- Thanks, thanks, I'm good.

37:57.258 --> 37:57.899
Another time.

38:01.095 --> 38:01.736
- Whatever.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.783
(car engine whirring)

38:06.934 --> 38:09.694
(tires screeching)

38:09.846 --> 38:12.622
(suspenseful music)

38:31.476 --> 38:32.216
(buzzer chimes)

38:32.311 --> 38:36.646
- Hi, it's amelie, uh.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.802
(door creaking)

38:42.821 --> 38:45.322
- Welcome to my humble abode.

38:48.327 --> 38:53.121
- By humble abode you
mean lavish mansion?

38:53.999 --> 38:54.289
- Tomato, tomato.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.500
Certainly keeps the rain off.

39:03.233 --> 39:04.415
You hungry?

39:04.568 --> 39:05.733
- [amelie] starving.

39:05.752 --> 39:07.510
- That's good, kind
of went all out.

39:10.073 --> 39:10.847
- [amelie] thank you.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.977
- My mother's recipe.

39:17.338 --> 39:19.022
- Mm, yum.

39:20.750 --> 39:21.933
- So have a confession.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.342
I miss-gauged the cooking time

39:23.362 --> 39:25.678
So we have about half
an hour til dinner.

39:25.772 --> 39:28.940
- Okay, well, how about a tour?

39:29.092 --> 39:30.700
- Mm, but of course, madame.

39:32.037 --> 39:32.660
Right this way

39:34.206 --> 39:36.831
(uplifting music)

39:50.705 --> 39:53.390
(slow funky music)

39:55.785 --> 39:57.227
Last, but not least.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.716
- You've got to be kidding me.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.476
- You don't have
pools in montreal?

40:05.570 --> 40:10.148
- They do, which is usually
a hole in the ground.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.151
(pierce chuckles)

40:13.245 --> 40:14.577
- How was your dinner with barb?

40:16.081 --> 40:18.915
- It was nice.

40:19.066 --> 40:22.919
Yeah, you were right,
she's just been rattled

40:23.070 --> 40:25.046
By the whole murder,
rightfully so.

40:29.094 --> 40:33.763
She did tell me something
that she felt I should know.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.990
- What's that?

40:36.083 --> 40:37.917
- She cautioned
me about your ex.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.327
- My ex?

40:39.345 --> 40:40.061
- Fran.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.349
You remember me telling
you about that woman

40:45.502 --> 40:49.170
That came into my studio and
smashed my picture of buster?

40:49.189 --> 40:50.405
- She's been to your studio?

40:52.842 --> 40:53.741
- Had a one-time class.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.620
- Okay, there's something I
didn't share with you earlier.

40:59.607 --> 41:01.941
I had to take a restraining
order out on her.

41:02.035 --> 41:04.535
It's a first, trust me.

41:04.688 --> 41:06.629
That's alarming that
she came to your studio.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.802
It's just too much
of a coincidence.

41:13.029 --> 41:15.805
- You know, everyone takes
breakups differently.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.535
This is embarrassing, but
I even googled the woman

41:20.628 --> 41:22.386
That my ex-husband
is now seeing.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.388
I looked her up on social media.

41:24.541 --> 41:28.893
It's kind of normal to quasi
stock your ex's new girlfriend.

41:29.045 --> 41:30.712
- This is different.

41:30.805 --> 41:33.731
- All I'm saying is that
maybe she's just having

41:33.883 --> 41:34.782
A hard time letting go.

41:36.069 --> 41:37.902
Just might take some time.

41:37.996 --> 41:38.953
- I hope you're right.

41:40.223 --> 41:41.331
- Let's change the subject.

41:41.482 --> 41:44.242
- Yes, please, but
you must tell me

41:44.394 --> 41:45.335
If she comes back in there.

41:46.487 --> 41:47.128
- Promise.

41:52.585 --> 41:53.676
You swim often?

41:55.238 --> 41:55.845
- Every day.

41:56.072 --> 41:57.180
- Every day?

41:57.331 --> 42:00.183
- Every day, every
day but today.

42:03.504 --> 42:04.187
- Oh, you're just,

42:08.434 --> 42:10.026
You're gonna get
in right now, okay.

42:12.605 --> 42:13.655
- No time on the present.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.034
(slow funky music)

42:20.780 --> 42:23.498
(water splashing)

42:29.622 --> 42:31.455
Are you coming?

42:31.608 --> 42:34.175
- How can I resist on
an evening like this?

43:13.666 --> 43:16.167
You are, you're the

44:09.555 --> 44:10.980
As the chicken I
made you, but close.

44:13.042 --> 44:15.151
- It's a good thing
your fire alarm is loud.

44:15.302 --> 44:17.737
I've never seen anyone jump
out of the pool that fast.

44:19.232 --> 44:20.305
Let me help you clean up.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.807
- Oh no, don't worry.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.551
It's my favorite bit.

44:23.644 --> 44:25.403
Seriously, I put a podcast
of piketon massacre

44:25.497 --> 44:26.737
And away I go.

44:26.831 --> 44:29.073
- Piketon massacre, what's that?

44:29.225 --> 44:31.501
- It's only the best true-crime
podcast there is right now.

44:31.728 --> 44:32.502
- Oh, really, okay.

44:34.822 --> 44:37.899
Looks like your fire
alarm triggered something.

44:37.917 --> 44:39.491
- [pierce] that's a first.

44:39.511 --> 44:41.235
- Burning a meal?

44:41.254 --> 44:44.013
- Yeah, that too, but never
triggered my fire alarm.

44:45.758 --> 44:46.924
- I just had a security
system put in my place, too.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.409
- [pierce] yeah?

44:48.502 --> 44:51.095
- Mm-hm, it was a freebie,

44:51.189 --> 44:54.916
But I now feel like I'm
living the life of the elite.

44:54.934 --> 44:56.859
- So that makes me elite?

45:01.441 --> 45:03.533
- Have you seen my purse?

45:03.760 --> 45:04.534
- Maybe over there?

45:05.537 --> 45:06.619
- [amelie] mm.

45:12.026 --> 45:13.525
Oh my god.

45:13.619 --> 45:15.119
- [pierce] what's that?

45:15.213 --> 45:19.290
- Well, it looks like a, a
pen exploded in my purse.

45:19.384 --> 45:21.125
That's so weird.

45:21.277 --> 45:24.369
- It's weird that a pen
exploded in your purse?

45:24.389 --> 45:25.704
- No, it's just that,

45:25.724 --> 45:28.474
Oh shoot, that is my ride share.

45:29.953 --> 45:31.060
- You know I could
have given you a ride.

45:32.789 --> 45:35.898
- I know, but that might
have led to something

45:36.125 --> 45:39.569
That we're not quite
ready for just yet.

45:39.720 --> 45:44.407
- Mm-hm, true, but at the
expense of sounding cliche,

45:46.152 --> 45:49.153
That was sincerely the best
evening I've had in years,

45:49.247 --> 45:50.246
So thank you.

45:51.583 --> 45:52.832
- It really was.

45:54.735 --> 45:56.310
And thank you for
these warm clothes.

45:56.403 --> 45:57.670
I will return them promptly.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.573
(water burbling)

46:01.667 --> 46:04.177
(lips smacking)

46:11.603 --> 46:13.344
- Don't forget my flip flops.

46:13.496 --> 46:14.187
- Those too.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.191
(water burbling)

46:23.506 --> 46:26.282
(suspenseful music)

46:28.620 --> 46:30.119
(car engine whirring)

46:30.271 --> 46:32.271
Thanks, have a good night.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.366
(door bangs shut)

46:35.518 --> 46:38.461
(suspenseful music)

46:44.527 --> 46:45.134
Buster?

46:48.807 --> 46:53.142
Bus! (whistles)

46:54.312 --> 46:55.645
Buster, where are you, buddy?

46:57.540 --> 46:59.557
(suspenseful music)

46:59.651 --> 47:00.399
Buster?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.488
Hi, there you are.

47:05.715 --> 47:07.064
Hi.

47:07.158 --> 47:07.907
Hi baby.

47:09.552 --> 47:10.827
Why are you sticky?

47:12.163 --> 47:13.979
Did you get into
something, b, hmm?

47:13.998 --> 47:14.914
You want some dinner?

47:16.167 --> 47:16.907
(buster barking)

47:17.060 --> 47:19.836
(door bangs)

47:20.063 --> 47:21.754
It's just the wind,
baby, just the wind.

47:24.734 --> 47:27.510
(paper bag rustling)

47:27.737 --> 47:29.587
(suspenseful music)

47:29.681 --> 47:30.429
There you go.

47:32.909 --> 47:35.768
(suspenseful music)

47:41.526 --> 47:44.676
Poured orange soda
all over my car.

47:44.770 --> 47:46.362
It was the stickiest
mess I ever had.

47:48.107 --> 47:50.700
(ominous music)

47:59.878 --> 48:01.210
- 911, what's your emergency?

48:03.773 --> 48:05.956
- Sorry, I didn't, I
didn't mean to call.

48:06.109 --> 48:09.051
(suspenseful music)

48:10.963 --> 48:12.889
Come on buddy, let's go to bed.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.065
(water burbling)

48:37.582 --> 48:39.657
(phone ringing)

48:39.809 --> 48:40.975
- [security]
security assistance.

48:41.068 --> 48:42.567
- Yes, hello, this
is pierce dalton

48:42.587 --> 48:43.568
Over on eighth avenue.

48:43.588 --> 48:44.995
- [security] how can I help you?

48:45.089 --> 48:48.090
- My security system
seems to be on fritz.

48:48.317 --> 48:49.333
- Let's check,
when did it begin?

48:49.485 --> 48:51.093
- Yeah, it began last night.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.931
- Sure, your system was
deactivated at 9:47 pm.

48:55.082 --> 48:56.766
- What do you mean,
it's deactivated?

48:57.769 --> 49:00.269
(tense music)

49:21.517 --> 49:24.201
- Amelie, I'm on the way. Lock
the doors and wait for me.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.211
Do not open to anyone.

49:26.798 --> 49:27.630
It's about fran.

49:27.857 --> 49:29.039
See you in a minute.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.801
(doorbell rings)

49:38.142 --> 49:41.218
(buster panting)

49:41.312 --> 49:43.813
(tense music)

49:49.821 --> 49:50.569
- Hi.

49:53.382 --> 49:55.807
You mentioned you
had security cameras?

49:55.827 --> 49:57.384
- [amelie] yes.

49:57.478 --> 49:59.161
- And you can watch the
footage on your phone?

49:59.388 --> 49:59.996
- Yeah.

50:02.241 --> 50:03.741
- Fran?

50:03.835 --> 50:05.743
- It's not activated.

50:05.837 --> 50:07.503
- I forgot to do that.

50:09.173 --> 50:11.323
There's something I
should have told you.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.250
After I met with barb,
I was walking home,

50:13.402 --> 50:16.754
And fran offered me a ride.

50:16.848 --> 50:18.405
- She was following you?

50:18.499 --> 50:20.090
- I didn't think it was
anything to worry about.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.333
She had pizza.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.834
She said she was in the area.

50:22.854 --> 50:24.270
- She was in my home, amelie.

50:26.673 --> 50:28.173
I saw her on the
security system today.

50:28.267 --> 50:29.250
- Your security system?

50:29.268 --> 50:30.693
- While you were there.

50:30.844 --> 50:33.011
She had your purse, she
looked dead into camera,

50:33.031 --> 50:34.772
She pulled a pin or
something out of her ear.

50:34.866 --> 50:36.440
- It's a pen.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.034
When she first came to my class,

50:38.261 --> 50:41.520
She had ink leaking
from her bag.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.280
And I told her this story,
I know this sounds stupid,

50:43.374 --> 50:46.208
But how I don't carry
pens in my purse anymore.

50:47.787 --> 50:48.952
And then I also
told her this story

50:49.047 --> 50:52.956
About how I spilled
orange soda in my car.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.550
She's been here.

50:54.777 --> 50:56.944
Pierce, I, I know
this sounds nuts,

50:56.962 --> 50:58.796
But it's the only thing
that makes sense. -

50:58.948 --> 51:00.205
- Back door?

51:00.224 --> 51:01.724
- Yeah, I made sure that
was locked last night.

51:01.875 --> 51:03.208
- But the front door, was
that open when you got back?

51:03.227 --> 51:05.469
- Yes, but it slammed.

51:05.621 --> 51:09.231
It was open and then shut,
like the wind, maybe.

51:11.903 --> 51:12.568
There's more.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.739
Barb told me she thinks
she saw fran at the party.

51:16.966 --> 51:19.658
She's not sure,
but she thinks so.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.662
- She's following you, pierce.

51:25.975 --> 51:27.899
- She's following you, too.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.901
This has got to stop.

51:29.921 --> 51:31.253
- Who are you calling?

51:31.405 --> 51:33.905
- Kip, lead investigator
on the case.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.257
It is out of control.

51:37.095 --> 51:39.002
It's going to voicemail.

51:39.097 --> 51:41.097
Kip, it's pierce dalton.

51:41.248 --> 51:44.341
I need you to call me as
soon as you can, it's urgent.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.852
(tense music)

51:50.349 --> 51:51.107
You okay?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.335
- I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

51:54.428 --> 51:56.028
- Let's get some fresh air.

52:02.011 --> 52:04.528
You know, I grew up around here.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.697
- Aren't you english?

52:06.849 --> 52:09.350
- What gave that away?

52:09.368 --> 52:10.793
No, my dad's an engineer.

52:11.020 --> 52:12.795
Got hired by a tech
firm here in the us,

52:12.946 --> 52:14.296
Moved when I was 10.

52:14.523 --> 52:15.856
- That must have
been a big change.

52:15.875 --> 52:17.133
- Yeah, but a good one.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.051
I really wasn't a fan
of the cold weather.

52:21.197 --> 52:25.224
Anyway, my brothers and sisters
used to swim in this ocean.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.726
Back in the day it was great.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.631
- In montreal, it was just,
we lived right downtown,

52:32.650 --> 52:34.650
So it was just
concrete city walks.

52:37.213 --> 52:39.321
Pierce. I'm scared.

52:41.567 --> 52:42.658
- I blame myself for this.

52:44.737 --> 52:46.053
Getting you tangled
up in all this,

52:46.071 --> 52:48.998
It's, you just met
me at a funny time.

52:49.149 --> 52:50.224
(buster barking)

52:50.242 --> 52:51.316
Is he okay?

52:51.410 --> 52:52.168
- Come on, buster.

52:54.655 --> 52:56.230
He's just not used to going
to the bathroom on the beach.

52:56.323 --> 52:57.656
- Oh, oh, he needs to pee?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.249
- [amelie] yeah.

52:59.343 --> 53:00.659
- Yeah, I'll go, take
him to little boys' room.

53:00.753 --> 53:01.844
Come on, come on.

53:03.014 --> 53:05.598
(tranquil music)

53:17.028 --> 53:19.528
(amelie groans)

53:21.014 --> 53:23.866
(suspenseful music)

53:39.959 --> 53:40.883
- [amelie] hey.

53:41.110 --> 53:42.125
- Hey.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.219
- Uh, my head.

53:44.447 --> 53:46.722
- [pierce] hey, doc, she's up.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.875
- Hello, amelie, I'm dr. Neifel.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.228
We're happy to see you awake.

53:53.639 --> 53:54.730
Do you know where you are?

53:55.716 --> 53:56.974
- At the hospital?

53:57.068 --> 53:59.068
- That's right, do you
know how you got here?

54:01.054 --> 54:01.737
- I was hit.

54:03.299 --> 54:04.465
- I'm gonna flash a
light in your eyes.

54:04.483 --> 54:06.075
It's gonna be a little
bit uncomfortable.

54:06.226 --> 54:07.243
Just bear with me, okay?

54:10.081 --> 54:11.914
Can I have you look to the left?

54:12.065 --> 54:12.915
And now to the right

54:15.586 --> 54:18.003
Great, how do you feel
about talking to the police?

54:19.573 --> 54:20.905
They have some
questions for you.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.240
- What kind of questions?

54:22.260 --> 54:24.651
- Just some things
to jog your memory.

54:24.670 --> 54:26.244
- You can use that button
there if you need me,

54:26.264 --> 54:27.337
Just go ahead and
give it a push.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.655
- Thanks.

54:28.674 --> 54:29.990
- Excuse me.

54:30.083 --> 54:32.326
- Um, listen, if,
I'm sure they can,

54:32.344 --> 54:33.352
If you're not up to it.

54:34.421 --> 54:36.330
- No, it's okay.

54:36.423 --> 54:37.848
- We're interested to recall

54:37.942 --> 54:41.092
If you remember having a
conversation with the woman

54:41.112 --> 54:44.262
The evening of your friend
barbara gershwin's party.

54:44.282 --> 54:46.097
Wondering if you
remember being approached

54:46.117 --> 54:48.191
By a woman that you didn't know?

54:48.286 --> 54:49.618
- I don't know,

54:49.770 --> 54:52.270
I, I talked to a lot of
people I didn't know.

54:52.290 --> 54:53.122
I'm new to town.

54:54.867 --> 54:58.627
- Is there anyone or anything
that seemed peculiar?

54:58.854 --> 55:00.713
Anything that you could
think of could help.

55:03.450 --> 55:06.385
(suspenseful music)

55:08.121 --> 55:09.471
- Is that your car?

55:20.484 --> 55:24.135
- I saw fran running
from that room.

55:24.155 --> 55:28.139
She had a, a fire bolt earring.

55:28.233 --> 55:29.158
She came from the room.

55:30.494 --> 55:34.330
Pierce, the room I found brian.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.168
(dogs barking)

55:39.395 --> 55:41.244
Don't hesitate to
call if he's too much.

55:41.397 --> 55:42.838
- And interrupt a weekend away

55:43.065 --> 55:45.990
With that tall
glass of hunkyness?

55:46.010 --> 55:47.417
Not a chance.

55:47.511 --> 55:48.902
- [pierce] ready?

55:48.921 --> 55:49.928
- [amelie] let's do it.

55:51.924 --> 55:54.424
- Oh, could you do me a favor
and toss this in the garbage?

55:54.577 --> 55:55.742
I don't wanna sound the alarm,

55:55.836 --> 55:58.354
But maybe a mouse
has been around.

55:58.581 --> 56:00.171
I found a pile of
it in my bathroom

56:00.265 --> 56:01.915
And I don't know,

56:01.934 --> 56:03.174
Maybe the little critter
was trying to dig a hole.

56:03.194 --> 56:04.509
The property manager's
gonna send by

56:04.603 --> 56:06.511
The exterminator, though.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.364
Didn't your house get inspected?

56:08.591 --> 56:09.848
- No.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.850
- But if there's a
mouse in the house,

56:11.944 --> 56:12.776
Buster will find it, right?

56:12.870 --> 56:14.352
- Yes, he will.

56:14.446 --> 56:15.445
I'll throw this way for you.

56:15.598 --> 56:17.706
- Okay, hill up girl, have fun.

56:19.192 --> 56:20.450
Just set it next to the
bin, I'll grab it later.

56:20.603 --> 56:21.618
- Thank you, margaret.

56:21.770 --> 56:23.027
Call if you need anything, okay?

56:23.047 --> 56:23.796
Anything at all.

56:25.866 --> 56:26.607
- See you margaret.

56:26.625 --> 56:27.299
- Bye now.

56:30.388 --> 56:33.055
(tranquil music)

56:34.558 --> 56:37.226
(birds chirping)

56:48.239 --> 56:50.572
- This place is a
little slice of heaven.

56:50.724 --> 56:54.076
- But if it's heaven,
then you must be an angel.

56:54.227 --> 56:55.994
- That was the cheesiest
thing you've ever said.

56:57.230 --> 56:57.913
- Couldn't resist.

56:59.324 --> 57:01.324
Yeah, my parents
discovered the keys

57:01.477 --> 57:02.835
Right after we moved to florida.

57:04.313 --> 57:06.738
Settled in and they
bought this beach house,

57:06.757 --> 57:09.149
So I come here as much as I can.

57:09.168 --> 57:09.925
- It's beautiful.

57:13.656 --> 57:15.931
Hey, can I ask you something?

57:16.082 --> 57:16.682
- Anything?

57:20.162 --> 57:22.438
- Why do you think fran's
having a hard time letting go?

57:22.665 --> 57:24.681
You said your first
couple dates were fun.

57:24.833 --> 57:26.275
- Yeah, they were fun.

57:26.426 --> 57:28.444
She was, she was fun.

57:30.096 --> 57:31.530
But then she wasn't.

57:33.617 --> 57:37.786
This is obsessive behavior
and I'm not a psychologist.

57:37.938 --> 57:42.040
I can't begin to understand
how someone becomes this way.

57:43.686 --> 57:45.210
I even felt bad for
her in the beginning,

57:46.964 --> 57:48.881
But now this is, it's
just gone on too long.

57:50.468 --> 57:51.875
I mean our whole relationship,
if we can call that,

57:52.027 --> 57:53.376
Was just three weeks.

57:53.529 --> 57:54.953
Yeah, I knew her for
a year before that.

57:54.972 --> 57:57.714
She'd come and go from the
office, but I don't know,

57:57.866 --> 58:00.124
I guess what I'm
trying to say is

58:00.144 --> 58:02.811
It's just all a bit
unbelievable, really,

58:03.038 --> 58:04.563
Getting tangled up
with someone like her.

58:05.983 --> 58:06.732
- Yeah.

58:10.062 --> 58:11.403
- How's your head?

58:12.823 --> 58:14.406
- It hurts, but
it's getting better.

58:15.659 --> 58:16.975
- You hungry?

58:16.994 --> 58:17.743
- Getting there.

58:23.334 --> 58:25.834
This is so good.

58:25.986 --> 58:29.396
- It's never a bad time
in season for stone crab.

58:29.414 --> 58:30.822
- Unless you're a crab.

58:30.916 --> 58:34.251
(pierce and amelie laughing)

58:34.345 --> 58:35.252
Try that.

58:35.346 --> 58:36.512
- Mm.

58:36.739 --> 58:37.420
- Yeah?

58:37.515 --> 58:38.180
- Even better.

58:39.591 --> 58:40.349
- Does that work?

58:43.003 --> 58:44.335
- Of course.

58:44.355 --> 58:45.437
- [amelie] hm.

58:49.676 --> 58:52.194

1:01:28.427 --> 1:01:29.518
- Good morning.

1:01:33.932 --> 1:01:35.023
- Good morning.

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:40.511
- Oh my god, you're stunning.

1:01:40.531 --> 1:01:43.031
(gentle music)

1:01:46.445 --> 1:01:49.279
(lips smacking)

1:01:49.373 --> 1:01:51.957
(waves crashing)

1:01:55.713 --> 1:01:58.213
(fork banging)

1:02:00.718 --> 1:02:01.791
- I'm thinking of
going down to the beach

1:02:01.944 --> 1:02:03.443
And collecting some shells.

1:02:03.462 --> 1:02:06.221
- Sounds good, maybe we
can go snorkeling later.

1:02:06.448 --> 1:02:07.797
I'm sure we'll find
an empty conch shell

1:02:07.950 --> 1:02:08.965
This time of the season.

1:02:09.117 --> 1:02:13.895
- Mm, I'd love that.

1:02:14.881 --> 1:02:16.139
- God, I love your lips.

1:02:16.233 --> 1:02:18.716
(gentle music)

1:02:18.736 --> 1:02:21.403
(waves crashing)

1:02:28.987 --> 1:02:30.245
- Hey, hey, girl!

1:02:32.565 --> 1:02:34.991
Hey, beautiful day, right?

1:02:35.143 --> 1:02:36.334
It's a little windy.

1:02:38.088 --> 1:02:42.174
Oh, I love seashells,
and dogs, too.

1:02:46.412 --> 1:02:47.988
It's a shame so many
people complain about them

1:02:48.006 --> 1:02:49.747
On the beach, am I right?

1:02:49.767 --> 1:02:51.415
I always had a cat growing up,

1:02:51.435 --> 1:02:53.493
So I never thought too
much about a dog, you know?

1:02:53.512 --> 1:02:55.086
It's always this like
love/hate relationship

1:02:55.180 --> 1:02:55.854
I have with them.

1:02:57.349 --> 1:02:59.257
But since we're all
about love recently,

1:02:59.351 --> 1:03:00.525
I figured we'd go with that.

1:03:02.428 --> 1:03:03.278
So good to see you.

1:03:05.857 --> 1:03:06.673
- Pierce!

1:03:06.691 --> 1:03:07.449
Pierce!

1:03:08.601 --> 1:03:11.119
(suspenseful music)

1:03:11.271 --> 1:03:11.953
She's here!

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:15.290
- Where?

1:03:16.518 --> 1:03:17.200
- She went that way.

1:03:17.294 --> 1:03:18.609
- [pierce] where?

1:03:18.629 --> 1:03:19.211
- Yes, yes, she was
just right there.

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:25.884
(tense music)

1:03:29.197 --> 1:03:30.305
- Pack our things up quick.

1:03:30.532 --> 1:03:31.973
Let's go back to the
city as soon possible.

1:03:34.202 --> 1:03:36.978
(suspenseful music)

1:03:54.723 --> 1:03:58.250
(suspenseful music continues)

1:04:00.987 --> 1:04:03.079
Amelie is texting
the address now.

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:05.582
- Got it, I'll connect with
the local authorities now.

1:04:05.734 --> 1:04:06.842
In meantime, you two stay safe.

1:04:06.993 --> 1:04:07.759
- Okay, thanks, kip.

1:04:09.329 --> 1:04:12.347
- She texted, she locked
herself out of my place

1:04:12.498 --> 1:04:13.682
With buster inside?

1:04:16.595 --> 1:04:18.353
- You left her a key, right?

1:04:18.504 --> 1:04:21.523
- No, I, I didn't think she
would need to get into my place.

1:04:22.751 --> 1:04:24.767
(brakes screeching)

1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:27.529
- I am so sorry, sweetheart.

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:30.440
I don't know how on god's sweet
planet I locked myself out.

1:04:30.592 --> 1:04:31.925
- How did you even get it in?

1:04:31.943 --> 1:04:34.094
- Well, the exterminator.

1:04:34.112 --> 1:04:35.871
She said she needed
to check your place.

1:04:37.115 --> 1:04:37.947
- Buster!

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:38.790
Buster!

1:04:42.270 --> 1:04:43.453
Buster!

1:04:43.547 --> 1:04:45.271
Fran, outside, said
something about dogs.

1:04:45.290 --> 1:04:46.047
Ah!

1:04:52.114 --> 1:04:53.388
Buster!

1:04:53.615 --> 1:04:54.222
Baby.

1:04:56.801 --> 1:04:59.135
- There you go,
baby, there you go.

1:04:59.287 --> 1:05:01.062
It's okay, it's okay.

1:05:01.214 --> 1:05:03.565
(buster panting)

1:05:03.716 --> 1:05:05.716
(suspenseful music)

1:05:05.736 --> 1:05:07.460
- The thumb drive from
the security cameras

1:05:07.479 --> 1:05:08.811
The night of the party?

1:05:08.964 --> 1:05:09.821
How'd you get this?

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:13.133
Barbara said she
turned off the system

1:05:13.226 --> 1:05:15.059
For their people's privacy.

1:05:15.078 --> 1:05:16.745
- They did, but they
forgot about this one

1:05:16.972 --> 1:05:19.247
Because it only faces
the back lane way.

1:05:19.399 --> 1:05:21.141
I should have brought it to
you right away when I found it.

1:05:21.159 --> 1:05:23.084
- So it's the back
lane way's footage?

1:05:23.236 --> 1:05:26.162
- And someone is seen running
out the back of the house.

1:05:26.256 --> 1:05:27.005
Fits the timeline.

1:05:30.986 --> 1:05:32.168
- [kip] this will help.

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:33.820
- Well, I bloody well hope so.

1:05:33.838 --> 1:05:36.264
Someone must have seen
her, know where she is.

1:05:36.416 --> 1:05:38.174
- We think.

1:05:38.326 --> 1:05:41.269
- Her computer, did we verify
that she hacked our system?

1:05:41.496 --> 1:05:44.164
- Yes, we say it's a
work computer from work,

1:05:44.182 --> 1:05:46.090
And her employer has
denied her access

1:05:46.184 --> 1:05:47.350
To all of her accounts.

1:05:47.444 --> 1:05:49.352
Unfortunately, we don't
have enough just yet

1:05:49.504 --> 1:05:51.112
To issue a warrant for her home,

1:05:51.264 --> 1:05:55.533
But we put eyes out front,
and this should help.

1:05:57.012 --> 1:05:58.861
I'm gonna head back
to the precinct now.

1:05:59.014 --> 1:06:00.697
She's dangerous, pierce.

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:04.033
And worse, amelie has
a target on her back.

1:06:04.186 --> 1:06:05.368
We're gonna do the best we can,

1:06:05.462 --> 1:06:07.295
But you're gonna need
to look out for her.

1:06:08.857 --> 1:06:11.716
(suspenseful music)

1:06:17.623 --> 1:06:18.974
- Strengthening your core.

1:06:20.719 --> 1:06:21.977
Nice, you really wanna
feel this in your abdomen.

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:25.296
Good.

1:06:25.390 --> 1:06:26.773
Now one more pull.

1:06:29.227 --> 1:06:30.318
That's it, one more.

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:32.636
Nice job, ladies.

1:06:32.656 --> 1:06:34.805
Thank you for
another great class.

1:06:34.825 --> 1:06:36.399
Okay, I'll see you
guys next week.

1:06:36.493 --> 1:06:37.158
- [barbara] ugh.

1:06:38.978 --> 1:06:39.995
- [amelie] bye, have a good one.

1:06:42.741 --> 1:06:43.814
Thanks for coming.

1:06:43.908 --> 1:06:45.458
- Hey, are you okay?

1:06:46.745 --> 1:06:47.651
- I'm fine.

1:06:47.746 --> 1:06:48.911
- Did you have to get stitches?

1:06:49.006 --> 1:06:49.896
- Uh, just five.

1:06:49.914 --> 1:06:51.172
- Just five?

1:06:51.324 --> 1:06:52.915
- Yes, I'm taking
precautions, barb.

1:06:53.068 --> 1:06:54.509
- Well, I just
have one question,

1:06:55.661 --> 1:06:57.570
Is he really that good in bed?

1:06:57.589 --> 1:06:59.906
- (laughs) way to make
light of the situation.

1:06:59.999 --> 1:07:01.332
- Well, it's a valid question.

1:07:01.351 --> 1:07:03.685
Oh, someone's ears
must have been burning.

1:07:03.912 --> 1:07:04.686
- Hey barb.

1:07:08.341 --> 1:07:10.007
- Hey, are you doing okay?

1:07:10.027 --> 1:07:11.693
- Yeah, I'll be better
when fran's caught.

1:07:11.844 --> 1:07:14.103
- Yeah, won't we all.

1:07:14.197 --> 1:07:16.197
Okay, I'm out of here.

1:07:16.349 --> 1:07:17.423
You call me if
you need anything.

1:07:17.517 --> 1:07:18.775
- I will, let me walk you out.

1:07:18.927 --> 1:07:20.702
- [barbara] yeah, thanks.

1:07:24.783 --> 1:07:25.874
(door bangs)

1:07:26.101 --> 1:07:28.376
- Locking the
door, that's smart.

1:07:30.789 --> 1:07:33.106
- I just don't want any
more surprise visits.

1:07:33.199 --> 1:07:35.383
- Yeah, do you have a minute?

1:07:35.535 --> 1:07:37.886
- I just finished the last
of my class, so yeah, sure.

1:07:39.798 --> 1:07:41.723
Did something else happen?

1:07:43.451 --> 1:07:44.059
- No.

1:07:48.807 --> 1:07:51.566
(suspenseful music)

1:07:54.145 --> 1:07:56.738
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

1:07:58.800 --> 1:07:59.407
- Excuse me?

1:08:01.469 --> 1:08:05.729
- It's not, everything
I've said stands.

1:08:05.749 --> 1:08:07.064
- But?

1:08:07.158 --> 1:08:09.066
- But this isn't healthy.

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:10.993
- For you or for me?

1:08:11.088 --> 1:08:12.754
- Look at you, amelie.

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:15.590
This isn't safe anymore.

1:08:17.427 --> 1:08:20.261
(melancholy music)

1:08:22.490 --> 1:08:23.098
- No.

1:08:24.492 --> 1:08:25.100
- No?

1:08:26.586 --> 1:08:28.177
- I'm not letting
her win, pierce.

1:08:28.330 --> 1:08:29.086
- This isn't about winning.

1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:30.563
- No, it's about control,

1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:35.759
And I refuse to let
fran control me,

1:08:35.854 --> 1:08:37.904
Or you for that matter.

1:08:40.525 --> 1:08:44.452
I'm not even scared
anymore, pierce, I'm angry.

1:08:45.438 --> 1:08:48.289
(melancholy music)

1:09:01.621 --> 1:09:05.623
Pierce, I can't help but believe

1:09:05.642 --> 1:09:08.143
That we came into each
other's lives for a reason.

1:09:10.538 --> 1:09:12.272
You've opened me up
in ways that I just,

1:09:15.894 --> 1:09:16.985
I never thought possible.

1:09:21.232 --> 1:09:22.548
And if we break up,

1:09:22.567 --> 1:09:23.974
We're just giving her
exactly what she wants,

1:09:24.068 --> 1:09:25.643
And when will that end?

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:26.452
Pierce, it won't.

1:09:33.728 --> 1:09:36.229
I'm not gonna lose you.

1:09:36.247 --> 1:09:40.750
- Are you sure?

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:42.343
- Kiss me.

1:09:42.495 --> 1:09:45.513
(soft seductive music)

1:09:46.758 --> 1:09:49.350
(lips smacking)

1:09:51.003 --> 1:09:54.022
(soft music continues)

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:11.447
(car door bangs)

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:14.358
(phone chimes)

1:10:14.452 --> 1:10:17.212
(suspenseful music)

1:10:20.199 --> 1:10:22.717
(fran screaming)

1:10:25.129 --> 1:10:26.704
(glass squeaking)

1:10:26.798 --> 1:10:27.555
It's not coming off.

1:10:29.617 --> 1:10:32.060
- Here, let me
have a go at that.

1:10:33.230 --> 1:10:35.546
(doorbell rings)

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:38.233
(birds chirping)

1:10:40.128 --> 1:10:41.402
- I'll check the
security camera.

1:10:44.482 --> 1:10:45.573
Okay, it's just margaret.

1:10:49.487 --> 1:10:51.137
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:10:51.155 --> 1:10:52.321
I hope I'm not disturbing.

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:53.581
- Of course not.

1:10:53.808 --> 1:10:55.808
- I made a lasagna
and I had extra.

1:10:55.827 --> 1:10:56.993
Thought you might enjoy it.

1:10:57.145 --> 1:10:59.069
- That's so thoughtful
of you, thank you.

1:10:59.089 --> 1:11:00.588
Wanna come in,
join us for dinner?

1:11:02.317 --> 1:11:04.241
- I'd love to, but my
show starts in 10 minutes

1:11:04.335 --> 1:11:05.318
And it's the finale.

1:11:05.411 --> 1:11:07.487
- Mm, you can't miss the finale.

1:11:07.505 --> 1:11:09.505
- I do this remote viewing
party with my sister

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:10.840
On the computer.

1:11:10.992 --> 1:11:12.750
It's just kind our thing.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.251
- I'm gonna make a salad,
and we'll bring you a bowl.

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:15.344
I'll text you.

1:11:15.438 --> 1:11:17.013
- No rush, sweetheart.

1:11:17.165 --> 1:11:17.772
Bye bye.
- [amelie] bye.

1:11:20.668 --> 1:11:23.093
(door bangs)

1:11:23.187 --> 1:11:25.338
(suspenseful music)

1:11:25.431 --> 1:11:28.908
(man speaking indistinctly)

1:11:34.532 --> 1:11:35.290
I'm so excited.

1:11:36.701 --> 1:11:37.458
It's gonna be good.

1:11:40.538 --> 1:11:43.798
- [man] different priorities,
different priorities.

1:11:47.028 --> 1:11:48.452
(indistinct) from the us.

1:11:48.471 --> 1:11:50.621
(computer chiming)

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:51.639
- There you are.

1:11:51.791 --> 1:11:53.215
Got your dinner ready?

1:11:53.368 --> 1:11:55.868
- [sister] mm-hm, yes,
ma'am, warming it up now.

1:11:55.887 --> 1:11:56.886
- I'm doing the same thing.

1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:58.646
This is gonna be good.

1:11:58.798 --> 1:12:00.056
I can't wait!

1:12:00.150 --> 1:12:01.274
- [sister] it's gonna
be great. I can't wait.

1:12:02.301 --> 1:12:03.209
(margaret screaming)

1:12:03.302 --> 1:12:04.652
- [sister] margaret, margaret!

1:12:12.554 --> 1:12:15.413
- There, okay, the
store on the corner.

1:12:18.835 --> 1:12:20.835
- You're looking for
something to clean the mirror?

1:12:20.986 --> 1:12:23.062
- Yeah, it's just the
vinegar wasn't working.

1:12:23.081 --> 1:12:26.248
(fran groaning)

1:12:26.343 --> 1:12:29.010
(dramatic music)

1:12:38.021 --> 1:12:40.438
(fran panting)

1:12:41.432 --> 1:12:44.025
(boots banging)

1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:47.603
(suspenseful music)

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:51.014
(fran groans)

1:12:51.034 --> 1:12:53.368
(tense music)

1:13:02.045 --> 1:13:05.955
- Hey, I really think
you should go for a run.

1:13:06.107 --> 1:13:09.366
- Yeah, I just don't think it's
a good idea leaving you here

1:13:09.386 --> 1:13:10.776
By yourself right now.

1:13:10.795 --> 1:13:12.294
- Hey, hey, I'll be okay, okay?

1:13:12.389 --> 1:13:13.946
You'll be quick.

1:13:13.965 --> 1:13:17.967
Plus, we need the glass cleaner,
so you can pick some up.

1:13:18.061 --> 1:13:20.561
(fran panting)

1:13:25.810 --> 1:13:27.143
- Are you sure?

1:13:27.295 --> 1:13:28.069
- I'm sure.

1:13:29.572 --> 1:13:30.554
- Lock the door.

1:13:30.573 --> 1:13:32.240
- I will, I will.

1:13:32.467 --> 1:13:35.243
(suspenseful music)

1:13:40.475 --> 1:13:43.066
(door bangs)

1:13:43.086 --> 1:13:45.753
(ominous music)

1:13:55.414 --> 1:13:57.840
- Have you heard anything?

1:13:57.934 --> 1:14:00.435
- No, nothing yet, but the
locks have been changed

1:14:00.662 --> 1:14:02.603
And police are
monitoring fran's house.

1:14:02.755 --> 1:14:04.421
- You're not home
alone, are you?

1:14:04.441 --> 1:14:06.274
- No, pierce is here.

1:14:06.425 --> 1:14:07.850
- Man of the hour.

1:14:07.944 --> 1:14:11.187
Now when you say he's
there, he's there, there?

1:14:11.281 --> 1:14:13.856
- Technically, no, but
he'll be back soon.

1:14:14.008 --> 1:14:15.691
(suspenseful music)

1:14:15.785 --> 1:14:18.453
(pierce panting)

1:14:27.297 --> 1:14:31.048
(suspenseful music continues)

1:14:38.958 --> 1:14:40.216
- [fran] why are you
doing this to me?

1:14:40.310 --> 1:14:41.309
- Whoa, fran!

1:14:43.705 --> 1:14:45.538
- You said that you love me.

1:14:45.631 --> 1:14:47.873
- Okay, we've been
over this, okay?

1:14:47.892 --> 1:14:50.376
- You said that you love
the way that I touched you.

1:14:50.394 --> 1:14:53.395
- No, I love nothing about you.

1:14:53.490 --> 1:14:54.972
Let me be crystal clear on that.

1:14:55.066 --> 1:14:57.158
- She is a whore, pierce,

1:14:57.309 --> 1:14:58.901
And I see the way
she touches you,

1:14:58.995 --> 1:15:00.143
And she thinks that
no one's watching me,

1:15:00.238 --> 1:15:01.329
And guess what?

1:15:01.556 --> 1:15:02.813
Guess what?

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:04.724
I've been watching
this whole time

1:15:04.817 --> 1:15:07.668
And everything she
does infuriates me,

1:15:07.895 --> 1:15:10.153
And everything you
do infuriates me.

1:15:10.173 --> 1:15:12.081
- You need to stop this.

1:15:12.175 --> 1:15:13.232
Stop it.

1:15:13.251 --> 1:15:16.344
- You make me so angry, pierce.

1:15:16.571 --> 1:15:17.678
It's like I see red.

1:15:17.830 --> 1:15:20.014
You do this to me!
- You need to calm down.

1:15:20.241 --> 1:15:22.258
- You do this to me!
- Calm down!

1:15:22.352 --> 1:15:23.518
Calm down, okay?

1:15:25.930 --> 1:15:27.688
- I thought it was you.

1:15:28.750 --> 1:15:29.357
- Brian?

1:15:31.510 --> 1:15:33.343
- He dressed like you,
he, he looked like you,

1:15:33.437 --> 1:15:34.937
He even smelled like you.

1:15:35.031 --> 1:15:35.696
- Were you...

1:15:38.426 --> 1:15:40.760
- He took his hands
down my pants.

1:15:40.853 --> 1:15:42.203
- Well, so what,
so you killed him?

1:15:42.430 --> 1:15:43.788
- Yes, I killed him.

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:47.208
I didn't have a choice

1:15:47.435 --> 1:15:48.601
Because you weren't
there to protect me.

1:15:48.694 --> 1:15:51.045
- Okay, I'm gonna
walk away right now.

1:15:52.623 --> 1:15:53.864
Don't you dare follow me.

1:15:53.883 --> 1:15:55.216
- Do not walk away
from me, pierce.

1:15:57.220 --> 1:15:59.387
- What are you doing?

1:15:59.538 --> 1:16:02.557
- If I can't have
you, no one will.

1:16:02.784 --> 1:16:04.374
She cannot have you!

1:16:04.394 --> 1:16:05.467
(pierce screams)

1:16:05.562 --> 1:16:08.879
(fran screams)

1:16:08.898 --> 1:16:09.880
- Stop, stop!

1:16:09.974 --> 1:16:11.807
- Help!
- [pierce] stop!

1:16:11.959 --> 1:16:12.883
- [man] hey!

1:16:12.977 --> 1:16:13.884
- Help, he's got a knife!

1:16:13.978 --> 1:16:14.810
He's got a knife!

1:16:14.904 --> 1:16:15.886
- [man] stop!

1:16:15.905 --> 1:16:17.129
(punch thuds)

1:16:17.148 --> 1:16:18.480
(pierce groaning)

1:16:18.575 --> 1:16:19.632
(dramatic music)

1:16:19.650 --> 1:16:21.058
(pierce groaning)

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:21.742
- Get off of me!

1:16:21.969 --> 1:16:23.319
- [man] hold still!

1:16:23.413 --> 1:16:24.579
- She's wanted by the police!

1:16:24.806 --> 1:16:26.488
- Stop fighting me.

1:16:26.583 --> 1:16:29.166
(dramatic music)

1:16:30.995 --> 1:16:34.088
(pierce groaning)

1:16:34.315 --> 1:16:37.091
(suspenseful music)

1:16:47.178 --> 1:16:49.687
(ominous music)

1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:57.528
(doorbell ringing)

1:17:06.271 --> 1:17:08.939
- Yeah, I'm at the park,
at the corner of fifth.

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:12.126
I'm holding down a white
male, approximately six one.

1:17:12.277 --> 1:17:14.203
He just attacked a
woman with a knife.

1:17:14.297 --> 1:17:16.297
- Fran gibbons, fran gibbons.

1:17:16.524 --> 1:17:18.374
Just tell them the
woman is fran gibbons.

1:17:18.468 --> 1:17:20.209
- Send an officer now, please.

1:17:20.361 --> 1:17:21.861
- Tell them!

1:17:21.879 --> 1:17:23.879
(pierce groaning)

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:26.390
(tense music)

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:34.565
(phone ringing)

1:17:36.486 --> 1:17:38.210
- [margaret's voice]
hi, this is margaret.

1:17:38.229 --> 1:17:39.895
Please leave a message.

1:17:39.989 --> 1:17:42.406
(tense music)

1:17:44.402 --> 1:17:44.992
- [man] I really loved.

1:17:45.219 --> 1:17:45.976
- Margaret?

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:46.810
- [man] incredibly supportive,

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:48.237
We gotta find somebody

1:17:48.389 --> 1:17:50.239
That's gonna put up
with your stupidity.

1:17:50.391 --> 1:17:51.891
- Margaret!

1:17:51.909 --> 1:17:53.984
- [man] and really help
you accomplish your dreams.

1:17:54.003 --> 1:17:55.819
- Margaret, I have your salad!

1:17:55.838 --> 1:17:58.655
- [man] never thought you'd
be able to accomplish.

1:17:58.675 --> 1:18:02.009
(smoke detector beeping)

1:18:07.591 --> 1:18:08.590
(oven door bangs)

1:18:08.685 --> 1:18:09.758
Margaret!

1:18:09.852 --> 1:18:10.592
Where are you?

1:18:10.687 --> 1:18:12.169
Are you okay?

1:18:12.188 --> 1:18:14.079
(smoke detector beeping)

1:18:14.173 --> 1:18:15.748
- [man] I thought you'd
be able to accomplish,

1:18:15.841 --> 1:18:19.585
And even the short time
we've spent together.

1:18:19.603 --> 1:18:23.447
(margaret yelling indistinctly)

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:30.187
(door clicks)

1:18:30.281 --> 1:18:31.688
(margaret moaning)

1:18:31.708 --> 1:18:33.356
- Oh my god, margaret!

1:18:33.451 --> 1:18:35.876
Margaret, oh my
god, what happened?

1:18:36.103 --> 1:18:37.194
- She had some stuff
that knocked me out

1:18:37.213 --> 1:18:38.361
So just leave me here.

1:18:38.381 --> 1:18:39.380
- Go, go now.

1:18:41.776 --> 1:18:44.126
- [man] even the short
time we together.

you to lock the doors

1:19:31.659 --> 1:19:34.268
And get into a safe location.

Please, just do what I say.

1:19:39.350 --> 1:19:40.107

1:19:43.687 --> 1:19:45.504
Amelie!

- [fran] I know who you
are, I know what you do.

1:20:42.654 --> 1:20:44.897
- You don't know
anything about me.

1:20:44.915 --> 1:20:47.341
- You are a stupid whore.

1:20:47.568 --> 1:20:49.159
- [amelie] I'm not.

1:20:49.178 --> 1:20:52.254
- Exactly what my father
used to call women like you.

1:20:52.406 --> 1:20:53.422
- [amelie] I'm not.

1:20:53.574 --> 1:20:56.241
Fran, I promise you I'm not.

1:20:56.335 --> 1:20:57.926
- Did he tell you
how perfect we were,

1:20:58.079 --> 1:20:59.244
Did he tell you that?

1:20:59.263 --> 1:21:00.855
- Fran, he did.

1:21:01.006 --> 1:21:05.175
- He told me and all these
women just kept interfering.

1:21:05.194 --> 1:21:06.752
(fran screams)

1:21:06.770 --> 1:21:08.320
And I know I was
so good to be true.

1:21:10.032 --> 1:21:13.759
Everyone just kept telling
him lies and lies about me.

1:21:13.852 --> 1:21:15.928
- I don't think
that's what happened.

1:21:16.021 --> 1:21:17.112
- Shut up!

1:21:17.206 --> 1:21:18.113
That is what happened!

1:21:18.207 --> 1:21:20.099
I know what happened!

1:21:20.117 --> 1:21:22.710
- This needs to end, fran.

1:21:24.438 --> 1:21:27.773
- You can't keep
living like this, okay?

1:21:27.791 --> 1:21:29.291
I'll help you, I promise.

1:21:29.443 --> 1:21:31.460
I promise I'll help you.

1:21:31.612 --> 1:21:32.177
- You took him from me.

1:21:34.465 --> 1:21:38.225
- He's not a possession,
fran, he's a person.

1:21:38.377 --> 1:21:39.284
- [fran] person?

1:21:39.303 --> 1:21:40.060
- He's an ordinary person.

1:21:40.287 --> 1:21:41.228
- He's mine!

1:21:41.380 --> 1:21:42.021
He's mine!

1:22:54.619 --> 1:22:55.970

1:22:58.215 --> 1:23:00.457
What did you do, fran, huh?

1:23:00.476 --> 1:23:01.867
What did you do?

1:23:01.885 --> 1:23:04.553
- She was trying, she
was trying to kill me.

1:23:04.705 --> 1:23:06.647
I'm a victim here, not her.

1:23:08.484 --> 1:23:09.483
I'm the victim!

1:23:11.153 --> 1:23:13.821
(pierce panting)

1:23:15.157 --> 1:23:18.325
Don't you see
everything I did for us?

1:23:18.477 --> 1:23:20.995
(waves crashing)

1:23:22.890 --> 1:23:25.332
- Fran, get your hands up
and your knees on the ground.

1:23:26.744 --> 1:23:27.668
Hands up, I said!

1:23:29.897 --> 1:23:31.630
Get an ambulance, quick!

1:23:36.253 --> 1:23:38.587
It's over, fran, it's over.

1:23:38.739 --> 1:23:40.139
- I did this for us.

1:23:42.018 --> 1:23:43.833
- [pierce] amelie!

1:23:43.853 --> 1:23:46.520
(pierce groaning)

1:23:48.691 --> 1:23:50.599
- [kip] pierce, get her up here!

1:23:50.751 --> 1:23:51.358
Help is on the way.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:55.696
- I did all all of this for us!

1:23:55.923 --> 1:23:59.033
- Fran gibbons, you are
arrested for the murder

1:23:59.184 --> 1:24:00.850
Of brian fletcher.

1:24:00.870 --> 1:24:01.777
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:24:01.871 --> 1:24:03.445
- You did this to me!

1:24:03.539 --> 1:24:03.871
- Whatever you say can and
will be used against you

1:24:05.432 --> 1:24:06.856
In the court of law.

1:24:06.876 --> 1:24:08.691
You have the right
to an attorney.

1:24:08.711 --> 1:24:10.269
(melancholy music)

1:24:10.287 --> 1:24:13.005
(water splashing)

1:24:15.718 --> 1:24:18.385
(amelie panting)

1:24:20.890 --> 1:24:24.466
(pierce panting)

1:24:24.618 --> 1:24:27.394
(suspenseful music)

1:24:30.307 --> 1:24:32.549
- Pushing those
legs out, very nice.

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:34.050
Make sure the small of your back

1:24:34.070 --> 1:24:35.477
Is really tucked into the mat.

1:24:35.629 --> 1:24:37.387
Nice job, two more.

1:24:37.406 --> 1:24:39.889
- Oh my god, I'm going to die!

1:24:39.909 --> 1:24:42.910
Uh, pilates-style
speaking, that is.

1:24:43.061 --> 1:24:44.319
(barbara groaning)

1:24:44.471 --> 1:24:47.206
- Great going, great
job, and that's it.

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:49.566
Nice job today.

1:24:49.585 --> 1:24:50.809
Thanks for another
fantastic class.

1:24:50.828 --> 1:24:52.377
I will see you guys
next week, okay?

1:24:53.647 --> 1:24:54.755
Good job today, bye.

1:24:57.318 --> 1:25:00.928
- Ah, you're not gonna
keep that there, are you?

1:25:01.155 --> 1:25:03.505
- No, no, just until
we finish moving in.

1:25:03.599 --> 1:25:05.991
- Moving in, it's a big step.

1:25:06.084 --> 1:25:07.083
- Sure is.

1:25:07.103 --> 1:25:09.494
- Oh, look at you, swooshin' in

1:25:09.513 --> 1:25:12.848
And snatchin' up the city's
most eligible bachelor.

1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.516
- Not without a fight, barb.

1:25:14.668 --> 1:25:15.758
- Well, that is true.

1:25:15.778 --> 1:25:17.669
(amelie laughs)

1:25:17.762 --> 1:25:22.674
- Mm, would it be
highly inappropriate

1:25:22.693 --> 1:25:24.860
If I were to request a
private pilates class

1:25:24.954 --> 1:25:26.912
With you and him?

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:30.916
- Considering that it's
called a private, maybe.

1:25:31.961 --> 1:25:34.035
- Oh, please, pierce,

1:25:34.130 --> 1:25:37.113
Don't feel the need to put
a shirt on on my account.

1:25:37.133 --> 1:25:39.133
- Putting it on because
that one's dirty.

1:25:39.284 --> 1:25:41.635
- Mm, he's cheeky.

1:25:41.786 --> 1:25:43.262
- Okay, bye, barb.

1:25:45.048 --> 1:25:48.625
- Okay, okay, never know,

1:25:48.644 --> 1:25:51.386
I might sign up for my own
lesson some day. (laughs)

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:53.463
- Bye!
- [barbara] bye!

1:25:53.482 --> 1:25:54.648
(amelie laughing)

1:25:54.799 --> 1:25:56.391
- How did he do?

1:25:56.543 --> 1:25:59.135
- Great, stopped every five
seconds to pee on a flower,

1:25:59.229 --> 1:26:01.488
But otherwise a runner.

1:26:03.808 --> 1:26:05.492
- I think I prefer
you without that.

1:26:07.145 --> 1:26:07.828
- Mm, okay.

1:26:09.406 --> 1:26:11.981
If you're finished with
your classes for today.

1:26:12.001 --> 1:26:14.393
- I just have one more private

1:26:14.411 --> 1:26:18.246
That I'm super excited for.

1:26:18.399 --> 1:26:20.916
This really hot client that
I can't stop thinking about.

1:26:21.010 --> 1:26:21.675
- Is that so?

1:26:21.902 --> 1:26:23.010
- Mm-hm.

1:26:27.574 --> 1:26:29.165
