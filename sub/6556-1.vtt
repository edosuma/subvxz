37th National Junior High
Baseball Championship

01:50.800 --> 01:51.755
Strike!

02:02.320 --> 02:03.514
Strike!

02:04.400 --> 02:05.276
Yes!

02:38.640 --> 02:39.470
Time-out!

02:40.080 --> 02:41.195
Time-out!

02:51.640 --> 02:53.392
He says put one in the strike zone and
catch him out

02:53.400 --> 02:55.960
If he hits,
who's going to catch the ball?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.989
I can handle it
Let's finish it quickly

02:59.440 --> 03:00.429
All right

03:13.360 --> 03:14.236
Swing!

03:43.840 --> 03:45.398
Myeong-jae!

03:45.640 --> 03:49.076
Myeong-jae! Myeong-jae!

03:55.760 --> 04:03.110
GLOVE

04:04.960 --> 04:08.236
You know his movements are alive

04:08.360 --> 04:13.275
Of course ball speed is important,
but Kim Sang-nam is even better than that

04:13.480 --> 04:15.948
He's a control artist
You admit that, right?

04:17.360 --> 04:18.952
Yes, you admit it too

04:19.160 --> 04:23.392
This is all that's needed!
An infield grounder

04:23.760 --> 04:25.637
You know the
Yankees' Rocket Man, right?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.392
Roger Clemens!

04:27.560 --> 04:30.313
Okay! And Curt Schilling!

04:30.320 --> 04:33.357
Do you know what their weapons are?
A splitter!

04:33.360 --> 04:34.793
SF!

04:34.920 --> 04:38.117
That's right!
You must like baseball!

04:38.120 --> 04:41.635
But don't you think it's a little late
for Kim Sang-nam now?

04:41.760 --> 04:45.753
Just take a look at
his recent results

04:46.000 --> 04:48.230
I think LG Twins will
take him out soon too

04:48.240 --> 04:51.038
United Airlines, tax free

04:51.120 --> 04:54.237
It tastes different
depending on the origin

04:54.800 --> 04:57.758
I heard the model for these cigarettes
died from lung cancer

04:58.480 --> 05:00.994
Just give it to someone else then

05:01.160 --> 05:01.956
Someone you don't like

05:01.960 --> 05:03.154
$100 check
Someone you don't like

05:03.160 --> 05:05.230
- Here...
- What? No...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.389
No...

05:07.680 --> 05:09.318
I've finished talking to
the victim

05:09.720 --> 05:13.838
Don't write about him swinging his bat
in your statement

05:14.200 --> 05:16.077
This is his last chance

05:16.200 --> 05:17.872
You'll be creating a Major Leaguer

05:17.880 --> 05:19.632
You'll be helping your country!

05:20.840 --> 05:22.068
Captain!

05:22.760 --> 05:25.069
Someone's here taking photos of
Kim Sang-nam

05:25.240 --> 05:26.673
What? Damn!

05:26.960 --> 05:29.952
Where's the journalist?
Where?

05:31.680 --> 05:33.477
Wait a minute...

05:38.360 --> 05:41.352
How did they even know he was here?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.238
Don't look at me

05:47.440 --> 05:49.396
They've got themselves a real story

05:51.440 --> 05:52.793
Hey! Don't!

06:01.600 --> 06:02.589
What?

06:02.880 --> 06:04.074
Kim Sang-nam charged again
for violence?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.479
Kim Sang-nam charged again
for violence?
Do you have anything to say?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.319
You can't expel him

06:08.720 --> 06:10.676
That's the same as killing him

06:11.240 --> 06:12.878
Take a look on the web

06:14.160 --> 06:18.278
Everyone wants him sent to jail

06:20.200 --> 06:22.714
Here! Take a look!

06:30.840 --> 06:35.436
5,925,285 persons?

06:35.880 --> 06:39.668
They all want to see him in jail?

06:40.320 --> 06:44.199
That figure is the number of
pro-baseball spectators last year.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.509
Oh...

06:45.960 --> 06:48.520
These days,
6 million watch the game

06:48.800 --> 06:51.633
Tomorrow, a new star will be born

06:52.640 --> 06:57.191
admit that Sang-nam played a part
in getting us this far

06:57.320 --> 07:03.634
But the fans are fickle these days
They won't forgive him

07:04.280 --> 07:06.919
Still, he was MVP
for 3 consecutive years...

07:06.920 --> 07:10.230
Highest strike-out rate per game,
highest number of wins, consecutive wins too

07:11.000 --> 07:14.993
I know that record will be broken
one day but let me tell you this

07:15.120 --> 07:19.272
No one can touch baseball fans'
hearts the way that Sang-nam has

07:19.280 --> 07:20.633
You know that too

07:20.760 --> 07:25.072
Those same fans
want him behind bars

07:25.160 --> 07:27.071
Do you not understand?

07:28.120 --> 07:30.714
Please have mercy, coach
I mean president...

07:31.280 --> 07:33.635
Sang-nam still has years
left in him

07:34.000 --> 07:36.309
He's just confused,
but I can control...

07:36.320 --> 07:39.118
You're not the
one playing baseball!

07:39.640 --> 07:42.950
He's the one who
has to come to his senses!

07:43.240 --> 07:44.912
How many times has it been already?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.716
Take a look at the next page

07:57.360 --> 07:58.634
What is this?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.591
Chungju Sacred Heart school?

08:02.320 --> 08:05.198
A school for the hearing-impaired
They formed a baseball team

08:05.400 --> 08:07.038
Send him there for a while

08:07.600 --> 08:10.319
I'll send the journalists over once
things quiet down

08:10.800 --> 08:12.756
Make sure he keeps practicing

08:15.000 --> 08:18.117
Thank you, president!
I mean coach!

08:25.120 --> 08:28.271
Hi, my name is Charles

08:28.280 --> 08:29.395
Cheol-su!

08:30.680 --> 08:34.878
I am pitcher Sang-nam Kim's agent,
Charles Jeong

08:34.880 --> 08:36.438
Jeong Cheol-su!

08:37.679 --> 08:38.669
What is it?

08:38.679 --> 08:41.717
Just turn the car around
It's too embarrassing

08:41.919 --> 08:44.354
What?
Do you have a better suggestion?

08:44.360 --> 08:47.557
No, but it's a school for the deaf
I can't go there, it's embarrassing

08:47.680 --> 08:50.558
We're just going to be putting on
a show using deaf kids

08:50.880 --> 08:54.316
If you know it's embarrassing, why did you
get drunk and wave your bat around?

08:54.640 --> 08:56.119
Public opinion is against you

08:56.240 --> 08:58.435
Everyone wants you to be expelled
and thrown behind bars

08:58.640 --> 09:00.915
Geez! They want me expelled for
getting into a little fight?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.197
Behind bars? After all that
I have done for them?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.436
No one remembers
what others have done

09:06.600 --> 09:08.591
Only what they will do
for them in future

09:08.600 --> 09:09.953
Screw them all!

09:11.920 --> 09:13.035
"I was drunk and can't remember"

09:13.040 --> 09:15.952
"I was drunk and can't remember"
Is this really necessary?

09:16.520 --> 09:21.389
He's a famous player and we really
need him on our baseball team

09:22.080 --> 09:24.674
This is an opportunity
sent from God

09:24.680 --> 09:26.671
Don't bring God into it!

09:27.120 --> 09:30.556
Do you think mentioning God will
talk me into it?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.312
Miss Nah!

09:34.880 --> 09:37.678
Why are you dressed like that
during working hours?

09:38.080 --> 09:42.039
You're the music teacher
You don't teach baseball

09:42.040 --> 09:44.270
I've finished music classes
for today

09:44.560 --> 09:47.632
Does that mean that you're no longer
the music teacher?

09:47.840 --> 09:51.628
I majored in Korean, but you told me to
teach music after I got here

09:53.840 --> 09:56.308
You know the school's circumstances

09:56.320 --> 09:59.949
Even so, it's not easy for me

10:00.080 --> 10:02.275
I don't even know
if I'm doing a good job

10:02.560 --> 10:06.235
Don't worry about that
You're doing very well

10:06.400 --> 10:11.520
God has his reasons for the people
he chooses

10:11.600 --> 10:14.592
Why are you bringing God into it?

10:17.720 --> 10:19.950
I'm not bringing God into it

10:20.560 --> 10:24.439
Do you think mentioning God will
talk us into it?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.993
Excuse me?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.593
It's just a joke

10:33.080 --> 10:38.074
Anyway, I won't allow you take
advantage of the children

10:39.520 --> 10:40.714
And!

10:41.040 --> 10:44.350
Please take care of the children who
are not on the baseball team as well

10:44.440 --> 10:45.589
Don't worry about that

10:45.600 --> 10:47.431
How can I not worry?

10:47.800 --> 10:51.395
Did you know that Myeong-jae didn't
come to school today?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.595
Excuse me? Again?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.039
You're pretty good

11:21.440 --> 11:23.351
Let's play a game against each other

11:25.040 --> 11:28.271
I think you're kind of cute

11:28.640 --> 11:29.789
How do you feel?

11:32.840 --> 11:33.829
Hey!

11:35.480 --> 11:38.517
You should answer
when you're spoken to

11:39.960 --> 11:41.154
I don't believe this

11:42.040 --> 11:44.076
Are you ignoring me?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.236
There's no point in talking to him

11:47.680 --> 11:49.511
He goes to Sacred Heart school

11:49.840 --> 11:50.795
What?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.148
He's deaf

11:52.160 --> 11:53.513
He can't hear you

11:56.400 --> 11:57.435
He!

11:57.560 --> 11:58.834
Can't hear!

11:58.840 --> 12:00.114
He's deaf!

12:08.280 --> 12:09.269
Geez...

12:10.640 --> 12:12.232
Talk about embarrassing!

12:14.400 --> 12:15.958
Don't laugh at me

12:15.960 --> 12:17.154
Maybe you have strong
maternal instincts

12:17.160 --> 12:18.513
You sure have weird taste in guys

12:18.520 --> 12:19.873
How embarrassing

12:19.960 --> 12:21.871
Why don't you just
go out with him?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.799
Is he crazy?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.069
Geez

12:43.080 --> 12:44.718
When you talk about me...

12:45.920 --> 12:48.195
Look at my eyes when you speak

12:50.640 --> 12:52.676
If you speak from behind...

12:53.720 --> 12:55.676
It all seems like cursing

13:01.720 --> 13:03.153
Hey!

13:03.240 --> 13:06.232
You're not just deaf,
you're dumb too

13:06.400 --> 13:07.355
Hey!

13:09.040 --> 13:10.029
Hey!

13:11.840 --> 13:12.829
Hey!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.639
Don't talk from behind!

13:33.600 --> 13:34.794
That was really good!

13:59.960 --> 14:00.949
Take off your goggles

14:02.080 --> 14:05.550
Welcome
It's great to meet you

14:05.760 --> 14:07.273
I'm the vice principal,
Kang Seon-il

14:08.000 --> 14:08.750
I'm Jeong Cheol-su

14:08.760 --> 14:10.239
- Are you his agent?
- Yes

14:10.240 --> 14:12.356
This is Miss Nah...
Come with me

14:13.720 --> 14:14.630
This way, please

14:28.520 --> 14:29.999
Attention, everyone

14:30.640 --> 14:33.916
I'm sure you all know
who he is already

14:34.120 --> 14:36.315
Korea's finest pitcher

14:36.440 --> 14:37.759
From LG Twins

14:37.760 --> 14:40.991
Mr. Kim Sang-nam

14:45.800 --> 14:48.837
He will coach you from today

14:48.840 --> 14:50.671
This is a rare opportunity

14:50.680 --> 14:52.033
Learn as much as you can

14:52.040 --> 14:55.350
Make the most of it, okay?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.671
Now I will introduce you
to the team

15:03.680 --> 15:06.114
It's all right
Let's just skip it

15:09.560 --> 15:12.950
You want to get to know them
as you train them?

15:12.960 --> 15:13.870
Yes, right...

15:14.000 --> 15:16.514
You really are a pro

15:16.960 --> 15:19.349
All the boys are so handsome

15:19.360 --> 15:22.318
They look like boy band pop stars,
not a baseball team

15:23.000 --> 15:24.638
- Do you think so?
- Yes

15:24.800 --> 15:28.509
Where is the rest of the team?
There aren't many gathered here

15:28.800 --> 15:30.199
All 10 players are here

15:30.320 --> 15:33.357
We were able to gather 10 boys from
the 21 male high school students

15:33.440 --> 15:35.670
You want to play baseball with
a team of 10 players?

15:35.680 --> 15:36.556
Yes

15:36.680 --> 15:38.557
Perfect! 10 is perfect!

15:38.680 --> 15:40.750
That's 5 more than TVXQ

15:40.920 --> 15:43.673
If we have another member,
these boys could be 2PM

15:43.960 --> 15:46.952
Are you joking?
What if someone gets hurt?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.116
No one's going to get hurt

15:49.560 --> 15:52.074
A positive mentality!
That's really important

15:53.240 --> 15:55.834
Would you like to see them play?

15:56.160 --> 15:57.639
Should I get them ready?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.712
Let's just go and eat

16:02.880 --> 16:04.791
Yes... That's true

16:05.080 --> 16:08.390
You're going to be here for a while
You should do a restaurant tour

16:09.120 --> 16:12.271
This must be why you're a pro

16:12.920 --> 16:15.673
What about the boys?
Should I dismiss them?

16:16.760 --> 16:18.352
Yes... Dismiss them

16:18.480 --> 16:20.118
Let's go and eat first

16:20.200 --> 16:21.315
- Come with me
- Yes

16:22.240 --> 16:23.719
You all did well today

16:23.800 --> 16:26.917
Let's prepare for afternoon class
after the break

16:34.800 --> 16:36.074
Wait, wait

16:38.120 --> 16:39.997
I think we made a mistake

16:40.200 --> 16:43.078
We should've given him
a proper welcome

16:46.000 --> 16:47.956
We didn't think he'd really come

16:48.960 --> 16:50.791
What should we do then?

16:52.080 --> 16:54.958
Let's all chip in

16:57.360 --> 16:59.351
But we don't even know
what he likes

17:02.400 --> 17:03.833
Pork ribs!

17:10.480 --> 17:11.549
This looks good

17:15.920 --> 17:18.309
Wow... It's good

17:19.200 --> 17:20.519
It's delicious

17:23.160 --> 17:24.559
- Please, eat up
- Yes

17:28.359 --> 17:31.113
The students really train hard,
don't they?

17:31.200 --> 17:32.758
There's a tournament in the fall

17:32.760 --> 17:34.512
Oh... A tournament

17:36.400 --> 17:37.992
National Tournament

17:42.680 --> 17:44.113
National Tournament?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.548
You want to let those boys compete
in this year's tournament?

17:47.920 --> 17:49.273
That's right

17:49.800 --> 17:53.110
Our boys don't just
play baseball for fun

17:53.480 --> 17:57.189
They're the 53rd official
high school team

17:57.200 --> 17:59.156
I want them to play in public

17:59.320 --> 18:01.151
It will also stimulate them

18:02.000 --> 18:05.549
In my opinion,
they'll just get hurt

18:07.360 --> 18:09.032
You have a point

18:09.200 --> 18:12.749
But if getting hurt proves to be medicine,
it's worth giving it a try

18:13.680 --> 18:16.069
Of course,
I totally agree with you

18:16.520 --> 18:17.873
Must be!

18:18.160 --> 18:20.071
I think it's totally necessary

18:22.200 --> 18:23.189
Lady

18:23.920 --> 18:26.514
Have you gotten hurt before?
How can pain be medicine?

18:26.520 --> 18:27.919
A scar is just a scar

18:27.920 --> 18:29.876
Medicine is what cures that scar

18:30.680 --> 18:31.908
Excuse me...

18:32.440 --> 18:34.032
Don't address her as lady

18:34.320 --> 18:36.151
Her name is Miss Nah Ju-Won

18:36.400 --> 18:38.834
- She takes care of the team...
- It's okay

18:38.960 --> 18:40.552
I am a lady

18:40.920 --> 18:43.992
How about you, Mister?
Haven't you ever been hurt?

18:44.960 --> 18:46.996
Did it just hurt?
Nothing else?

18:47.720 --> 18:51.713
The only way to avoid
getting hurt is to do nothing

18:52.000 --> 18:54.833
But we can't do that
We have to do something

18:54.920 --> 18:56.990
Does baseball look easy to you?

18:57.280 --> 19:02.638
Do you know how hard some kids train to
play in a national tournament?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.119
If you did know that...

19:06.560 --> 19:08.835
I bet you'd feel bad
about saying that

19:10.240 --> 19:13.437
Do you know how much pain our boys
have had to put up with?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.198
If you knew, I bet you would feel bad
about talking like that too

19:19.800 --> 19:23.679
If they need to go through more pain,
they're ready for that

19:24.520 --> 19:26.112
Take a look at our boys first

19:26.280 --> 19:27.633
Take a look then judge them

19:29.200 --> 19:31.509
Isn't that more important than
checking out restaurants?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.478
Of course it is

19:34.480 --> 19:37.916
That's more important than eating...
Isn't that right?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.114
Up yours...

19:47.040 --> 19:48.553
Oh! Excuse me...

19:50.560 --> 19:51.959
Hello?

19:52.120 --> 19:53.951
Yes, behind Kyobo is good

19:53.960 --> 19:55.313
Book the royal room there

19:55.880 --> 19:59.634
What can I do?
I have to show them a good time

19:59.920 --> 20:01.433
All right, okay

20:05.520 --> 20:08.239
What's with her? Geez...

20:09.680 --> 20:12.114
How could you say 'up yours'?

20:12.240 --> 20:14.196
She's a teacher, you know

20:14.200 --> 20:15.679
Baseball isn't a joke

20:15.680 --> 20:17.352
I told you it was our treat

20:17.360 --> 20:18.998
Why did you pay for the meal?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.115
It's all right

20:20.120 --> 20:23.476
Thank you for accepting coach Kim

20:23.640 --> 20:27.155
We're the ones who
are grateful to him

20:27.160 --> 20:28.434
Yes, I see

20:28.440 --> 20:30.032
Just go get the car

20:31.120 --> 20:32.439
The car...

20:32.880 --> 20:33.949
It's over there

20:38.440 --> 20:40.271
You want me to ride
that to the hotel?

20:41.720 --> 20:44.632
Not a hotel, to the school

20:45.040 --> 20:46.871
What do you mean by that?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.189
You're a teacher now

20:50.000 --> 20:53.709
Where is your home now, my friend?
The school dormitory. Do you understand?

20:56.800 --> 21:00.395
- Kim Sang-nam, you can do it!
- Wait a minute! Cheol-su! Hey!

21:08.840 --> 21:10.159
What are we doing here?

21:10.920 --> 21:13.832
I'm sorry.
Please wait here a moment

21:13.840 --> 21:14.716
Excuse me?

21:18.640 --> 21:21.598
Why are we at the
police station? Geez...

21:22.520 --> 21:25.512
The attacker is refusing to
make a statement

21:25.600 --> 21:28.194
We've used the victims' statements to
write up the report

21:28.200 --> 21:29.349
I'll settle it accordingly

21:29.360 --> 21:30.315
All right, good work

21:30.320 --> 21:33.198
Captain Lee,
you know that's not true

21:33.200 --> 21:35.350
You know our boys
wouldn't do that

21:35.360 --> 21:37.396
No, no, no!

21:38.040 --> 21:39.917
I just believe what I see

21:39.920 --> 21:41.148
Take a look here

21:41.440 --> 21:44.079
1 boy against 3...

21:44.160 --> 21:47.038
The ones who are hurt are these 3
sitting over here

21:47.360 --> 21:49.351
What do you think
this suggests to me?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.558
Do you teach martial arts
at your school?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.437
You're being ridiculous

21:54.440 --> 21:57.273
Don't just think about who got hurt
Think about the circumstances

21:57.480 --> 21:59.994
Hang on. Don't bother
writing up the report

22:00.120 --> 22:02.031
Just take a photo of these 3

22:02.040 --> 22:04.508
Take a close-up of his fist and
present it to the chief police station

22:04.520 --> 22:06.590
- Just throw him behind bars!
- Yes

22:07.280 --> 22:08.838
Wait...

22:09.080 --> 22:10.479
Captain!

22:25.720 --> 22:27.551
Wanted list

22:34.080 --> 22:35.638
Turn your head

22:35.640 --> 22:36.629
Excuse me?

22:36.640 --> 22:37.959
Take your glasses off

22:39.040 --> 22:41.759
Geez. I don't believe this

22:47.480 --> 22:49.675
Aren't you Kim Sang-nam?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.712
What are you doing?
Just have him put behind bars!

22:57.080 --> 22:58.035
My teeth are killing me

22:58.040 --> 22:59.314
Hey, hey, hey!

22:59.320 --> 23:00.753
Be quiet, you fools!

23:03.200 --> 23:04.872
How dare you?

23:07.240 --> 23:10.391
This is a small station

23:10.520 --> 23:15.150
But we filed the decisive evidence for
the beauty salon mugger

23:15.160 --> 23:17.230
- I see...
- Isn't that Kim Sang-nam?

23:17.320 --> 23:18.196
LG Twins?

23:18.200 --> 23:20.191
- It is! It's him!
- Wow!

23:24.320 --> 23:26.197
He's really good-looking...

23:31.760 --> 23:32.988
Let there be love!
Kim Sang-nam

23:33.000 --> 23:37.551
Let there be love!
Kim Sang-nam
Are you really the coach of Sacred
Heart school's baseball team?

23:38.280 --> 23:42.432
Not really...
For now, yes

23:43.680 --> 23:45.193
You mean it? Really?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.599
It's true

23:46.600 --> 23:50.070
He's here to send our baseball team
to a national tournament

23:50.080 --> 23:51.513
Who says I'm going to do that?

23:52.400 --> 23:53.719
What do you want?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.159
You're so humble

23:55.160 --> 23:57.674
What do you think you're doing?

23:58.040 --> 24:00.554
Aren't you going to lock him up?

24:00.680 --> 24:01.908
What is this?

24:04.440 --> 24:05.998
Are you a judge?

24:06.440 --> 24:09.591
I'm the one with authority here

24:10.240 --> 24:12.390
How cruel must you have been
to make a boy

24:12.400 --> 24:14.231
who can't even hear that angry?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.599
The 3 of you ganging up against him...

24:17.840 --> 24:20.912
Are you proud of that?
Just be quiet!

24:22.480 --> 24:24.357
We have a precious guest here

24:25.080 --> 24:28.709
You boys put our community to shame

24:31.960 --> 24:35.077
Let there be love!
LG Twins, Kim Sang-nam

24:36.560 --> 24:37.675
That's 20 copies

24:41.600 --> 24:42.919
I think my arm's going to fall off

24:42.920 --> 24:45.912
Hey! Give them a copy each and
send them home

24:45.920 --> 24:47.512
- Store the rest in a safe place
- Yes

24:47.520 --> 24:48.635
Are we done now?

24:48.640 --> 24:52.076
Yes, now...
If we could get a photograph...

24:52.080 --> 24:53.195
Excuse me?

24:53.560 --> 24:54.788
I'm going to take it now

24:55.040 --> 24:56.155
Everyone, don't forget to smile

24:56.840 --> 24:58.068
What should we do?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.069
Should we say a cheer?

24:59.080 --> 25:00.229
Let's not do that

25:00.320 --> 25:02.072
Come on!

25:02.440 --> 25:05.318
Chungju Sacred Heart baseball team,
you can do it!

25:05.400 --> 25:06.469
You can do it!

25:08.920 --> 25:11.593
Thank you for helping us out

25:11.960 --> 25:14.793
That boy...
Is he a troublemaker?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.474
His name is Cha Myeong-jae

25:17.600 --> 25:21.434
He was the best pitcher at the
junior high baseball tournament 2 years ago

25:21.640 --> 25:24.950
He had sudden difficulty with his hearing,
then lost it altogether

25:25.240 --> 25:26.798
He doesn't want to
play baseball again

25:26.920 --> 25:29.718
I try to convince him,
but it's useless

25:29.880 --> 25:34.954
He knows how to talk and he's quite
different to the other students

25:35.080 --> 25:37.548
Even so, how can an athlete get
into a fight?

25:37.920 --> 25:39.831
It's no wonder he never made it!

25:41.080 --> 25:45.471
That really strikes the heart hearing it
from someone who has experience

25:48.040 --> 25:52.955
In any case, it's nice to see
2 young people sitting together like this

25:53.040 --> 25:55.076
Could you watch your words?

25:55.080 --> 25:56.832
I'm fussy about who I meet

25:57.080 --> 25:58.911
I'm sorry

26:00.520 --> 26:02.192
Sorry? What for?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.879
He said he's fussy

26:04.080 --> 26:06.469
What? That's ridiculous

26:06.720 --> 26:08.756
I'm fussy with who I meet too

26:09.120 --> 26:10.872
Calm down, Miss Nah

26:11.280 --> 26:13.953
Vice principal,
why did you apologize?

26:13.960 --> 26:18.715
Because I said I'm fussy!
I'm fussy! With women!

26:19.360 --> 26:21.430
- Hey!
- Goodness, you shocked me

26:21.640 --> 26:23.676
Hey? How old are you?

26:23.800 --> 26:25.518
I'm old enough to call you hey

26:34.440 --> 26:36.556
He's coming! He's coming!

26:43.120 --> 26:46.829
I told them to take a rest
They're still outside training

26:46.840 --> 26:49.434
Boys who don't want to study prefer
to play baseball

26:50.000 --> 26:51.718
Please stop fighting

26:54.920 --> 26:56.672
Here we are!
It's not as comfortable as a hotel...

26:56.800 --> 27:01.430
But your agent said this will help you
to get closer to the boys

27:02.320 --> 27:03.992
We can win in the
national tournament!

27:05.240 --> 27:07.879
Oh... Wow!

27:10.560 --> 27:12.232
I'm allergic to flowers

27:16.520 --> 27:20.229
Soft drinks,
biscuits that make you fat

27:22.800 --> 27:25.519
Vitamins should go to someone who
has terrible skin...

27:29.080 --> 27:30.195
I like that

27:30.960 --> 27:31.790
I'm going to get you

27:31.800 --> 27:34.360
All right then
Make sure you get a good rest

27:36.040 --> 27:38.190
He really has an attitude problem

27:38.320 --> 27:41.073
He only just got here
He must feel out of place

27:41.080 --> 27:43.674
Even so, the boys
wanted to welcome him

27:43.680 --> 27:45.398
Come on, let's go

27:45.760 --> 27:47.079
Geez...

27:48.560 --> 27:49.549
Wake up!

27:50.120 --> 27:52.634
Get up! Get up!

27:55.320 --> 27:56.878
What does she want?

28:04.680 --> 28:07.638
Time to get up, coach Kim!

28:08.720 --> 28:10.392
What's wrong with her?

28:13.680 --> 28:15.671
I said get up

28:15.760 --> 28:17.193
Did you come here to sleep?

28:20.920 --> 28:22.831
I said, get up!

28:25.640 --> 28:28.552
You're wearing practically nothing

28:29.560 --> 28:33.109
What are you doing?
This is sexual harassment

28:33.200 --> 28:36.590
It is not.
Just go and get dressed

28:38.040 --> 28:39.268
I've ruined my eyes

28:44.240 --> 28:45.593
Is she really female?

28:46.560 --> 28:49.313
She just charged in here
so she could take a look

28:54.960 --> 28:57.952
You're wearing an LG uniform to
our school's game?

28:57.960 --> 28:59.313
What? A game?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.675
There's a game scheduled for today

29:01.760 --> 29:04.718
You can see for yourself how good
our boys are

29:04.720 --> 29:07.678
Just let them play on their own
They seem to have fun

29:07.800 --> 29:09.028
What do you mean by that?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.197
It's not like they'll
win the tournament

29:12.200 --> 29:15.476
Don't harass them just
so they can win 1 game

29:15.800 --> 29:18.360
You don't think we'll
be able to win a game?

29:18.680 --> 29:21.319
Take a look for yourself...
With those fish eyes of yours

29:22.680 --> 29:23.749
What?

29:25.120 --> 29:27.873
Fine then.
Let's see how good they are

29:32.200 --> 29:33.189
Gunsan?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.998
Isn't that a bit rough
for their first game?

29:35.320 --> 29:36.912
Gunsan junior high

29:37.160 --> 29:38.513
They're a good team

29:38.960 --> 29:40.029
What?

29:40.560 --> 29:41.754
Junior high?

29:42.800 --> 29:44.279
Is this some kind of joke?

29:44.280 --> 29:46.077
It's not a joke

29:46.400 --> 29:48.550
This is an official game

29:49.120 --> 29:50.872
They're a good team

29:51.840 --> 29:54.957
This is so embarrassing
I don't believe this

29:55.440 --> 29:56.350
Attention!

29:56.480 --> 29:57.276
Bow!

30:00.840 --> 30:03.308
Chungju Sacred Heart,
we can do it!

30:13.120 --> 30:14.235
Play ball!

30:20.080 --> 30:20.876
Ball

30:58.720 --> 31:00.915
They're hopeless

31:03.520 --> 31:05.158
It's all right, don't worry

31:18.480 --> 31:19.708
It's in the air! In the air!

31:23.000 --> 31:24.592
You can catch it! Catch it!

31:28.600 --> 31:29.350
Crash!

31:36.280 --> 31:37.349
Run around!

31:51.600 --> 31:53.750
See? I told you

31:53.880 --> 31:55.233
Don't say that!

31:55.400 --> 31:56.549
The game only just began

31:57.120 --> 31:59.156
It's all right

31:59.160 --> 32:01.913
You can catch up to them
No problems, don't worry!

32:16.400 --> 32:17.196
Out!

32:18.600 --> 32:19.350
Out!

32:19.760 --> 32:21.273
That's great!

32:27.800 --> 32:29.313
Take a good look

32:38.840 --> 32:39.795
Strike!

32:45.680 --> 32:47.079
Strike 2!

32:50.560 --> 32:51.993
Out!

32:58.360 --> 33:01.238
Wow... A batter who's
afraid of the ball?

33:02.200 --> 33:04.191
What did you want me
to take a look at?

33:09.800 --> 33:13.315
Be confident and relax
Got that? You can do it

33:20.080 --> 33:21.354
Take a good look

33:21.840 --> 33:24.479
He's the fastest runner
on our team

33:24.920 --> 33:27.388
You're going to get a real shock

33:32.600 --> 33:33.510
See?

33:39.040 --> 33:39.916
Out!

33:47.120 --> 33:48.439
Yes, nice work

33:55.920 --> 33:58.036
Our boys try really hard, right?

33:59.120 --> 34:02.908
Just let them play for fun...
Why enter a national tournament?

34:02.920 --> 34:06.037
If you're going to keep saying that...
Just go...

34:17.320 --> 34:18.992
Home run!

34:26.080 --> 34:27.911
He sure poses like a major leaguer

34:36.320 --> 34:37.753
Gunsan 3/ Sacred Heart 1

34:39.920 --> 34:40.556
Out!

34:41.719 --> 34:42.914
Okay

34:53.400 --> 34:54.389
Great!

34:54.719 --> 34:56.710
Nice work!

35:00.080 --> 35:02.071
- Yes!
- Safe!

35:14.880 --> 35:16.313
Yes, good work

35:17.480 --> 35:19.198
I said good work

35:20.960 --> 35:24.839
Geez... Don't worry about me
Just focus on the game

35:28.160 --> 35:30.628
He's really proud of you

35:34.080 --> 35:35.115
What's wrong with them?

35:36.480 --> 35:38.198
Gunsan / Sacred Heart

35:44.440 --> 35:45.634
I know it's tough

35:45.760 --> 35:47.910
Hang in there, you can do it

35:51.360 --> 35:52.349
You must be hot

35:58.600 --> 36:02.479
I was afraid that you would leave
without even taking a look

36:05.160 --> 36:09.551
Is there someone in your family who
is hearing impaired too?

36:09.840 --> 36:10.795
Why do you ask?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.508
You act like their mom...

36:15.760 --> 36:18.991
I don't have any other reasons

36:20.160 --> 36:21.434
I just like them

36:26.920 --> 36:27.909
Oh no!

36:28.080 --> 36:29.798
Cheol-seung!

36:34.880 --> 36:36.438
Cheol-seung, are you all right?

36:37.800 --> 36:38.915
Are you hurt?

36:39.680 --> 36:41.671
- Oh no...
- It's all right...

36:41.680 --> 36:43.989
It's all right, calm down

36:51.880 --> 36:55.634
Of course you could get hurt
playing baseball

36:56.000 --> 36:57.353
Cheol-seung...

36:58.200 --> 37:02.671
If you give up now, all your hard work
just goes to waste

37:03.040 --> 37:07.431
We have a new coach now
Let's not give up now

37:10.480 --> 37:12.311
You're our only pitcher

37:12.320 --> 37:15.312
If you give up,
how will the others play baseball?

37:16.760 --> 37:19.194
Hey, Cheol-seung!

37:19.520 --> 37:20.475
Cheol-seung!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.069
Cheol-seung!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.918
We need you

37:30.080 --> 37:32.389
You know that

37:32.920 --> 37:34.717
It's my life

37:35.160 --> 37:37.674
I can't give up my life for you

37:37.800 --> 37:40.109
You can't give up just because
you got hit by the ball

37:40.120 --> 37:42.031
It's not just because I got hit

37:43.320 --> 37:45.276
There's no hope for us

37:45.760 --> 37:48.558
No matter how hard we try,
we can't beat the other teams

37:48.680 --> 37:51.513
But we're still going to enter
Join us

37:53.040 --> 37:54.439
I'm sorry

38:03.440 --> 38:04.873
Is something wrong?

38:10.320 --> 38:14.632
This is the reason why I was against
the baseball team being formed

38:15.480 --> 38:18.438
These children are disabled
If they get hurt...

38:18.560 --> 38:21.279
Who will be responsible
for their lives?

38:22.080 --> 38:25.516
We should prepare them so
they can adjust to society

38:25.640 --> 38:29.110
It is our role to educate them,
not teach them to play baseball

38:29.240 --> 38:32.118
Do our students even
adjust to society?

38:32.520 --> 38:33.748
What do you mean by that?

38:33.760 --> 38:38.390
I'm asking if you have ever seen them
treated like ordinary people

38:38.400 --> 38:40.152
What is your point?

38:40.160 --> 38:42.469
An educational system that doesn't
help them to eat and make ends meet...

38:42.480 --> 38:44.516
I don't think it's necessary

38:44.520 --> 38:45.919
If they play baseball...

38:46.040 --> 38:49.476
Will that help them
to make ends meet?

38:49.560 --> 38:52.438
They can still play baseball despite
hearing impairment

38:52.520 --> 38:55.273
There are such professional players
in the United States and Japan

38:55.400 --> 38:56.549
So?

38:56.680 --> 39:01.276
Baseball is one of the
few methods by which

39:01.280 --> 39:03.510
our boys can be treated
like ordinary

39:03.640 --> 39:08.191
Who is going to take our boys and
turn them into professional players?

39:08.280 --> 39:12.068
Is there a business team
that they can play in?

39:16.880 --> 39:21.874
Everyone knows that baseball
interrupts their studies

39:22.880 --> 39:25.030
There will be a board meeting soon

39:25.040 --> 39:27.634
We will discuss the
baseball team's future

39:31.280 --> 39:33.874
Shouldn't he be here begging?

39:34.720 --> 39:36.392
What's he up to?
Why isn't he here?

39:36.800 --> 39:39.075
He's at a school for
the hearing-impaired

39:39.080 --> 39:40.479
He's coaching baseball there

39:40.800 --> 39:45.351
I told him it wasn't necessary
but he wanted time to reflect

39:45.520 --> 39:48.557
Is Sang-nam still our star player?

39:48.960 --> 39:52.589
Of course not
Why should I take favour on him?

39:53.160 --> 39:56.391
But he's still the biggest star in
Korean baseball

39:56.720 --> 39:58.950
Star player? Whatever!

39:59.520 --> 40:01.636
I thought he was a real FA catch

40:01.760 --> 40:04.479
Do you know how much
I've spent on him over 3 years?

40:05.200 --> 40:08.237
He's so ungrateful

40:10.200 --> 40:12.839
He's managed to ruin
our team's reputation

40:14.040 --> 40:15.758
He's waking up to himself now

40:15.840 --> 40:19.071
If his condition is back to 70 or 80%
of his peak form...

40:19.080 --> 40:20.399
He's waking up to himself?

40:20.760 --> 40:23.433
Huh! He's going to
play with deaf kids...

40:23.640 --> 40:25.153
So he can be excused?

40:25.720 --> 40:29.679
He's always rattling his brains like this
That's why he won't make it

40:29.960 --> 40:32.394
He thinks he's good because
the KBO president's on his side

40:32.600 --> 40:33.589
Excuse me

40:36.440 --> 40:37.668
What?

40:39.360 --> 40:40.713
What is it?

40:42.320 --> 40:45.949
They're not deaf,
they're hearing impaired

40:47.040 --> 40:48.234
What?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.029
Are you adjusting well?

40:50.040 --> 40:52.554
Sure! I love it here

40:52.560 --> 40:55.996
Good food, fresh air, nice people...
I love this place

40:56.240 --> 40:59.118
It's paradise here!
Paradise...

40:59.120 --> 41:03.477
I don't have much time
I just came to check up on you

41:03.600 --> 41:06.558
Geez... Do you have to
act so busy?

41:09.120 --> 41:11.270
Have you seen Cheol-su lately?

41:11.520 --> 41:12.635
Why do you ask?

41:13.320 --> 41:16.357
He's going around seeing people

41:16.760 --> 41:19.399
He's trying to stop you from getting dismissed
He's trying to save your ass

41:23.920 --> 41:27.549
Hey... How about
looking into Taiwan?

41:28.680 --> 41:31.399
You can't really start
in the minor leagues at our age

41:31.560 --> 41:33.710
The salaries are
high in Taiwan too

41:33.720 --> 41:34.948
Geez...

41:35.480 --> 41:38.836
Now that you're the key player,
is money all you care about?

41:40.320 --> 41:42.550
You shouldn't play baseball
for money

41:46.120 --> 41:47.235
That's true

41:48.120 --> 41:49.951
We don't play baseball for money

41:52.480 --> 41:53.674
So tell me

41:54.000 --> 41:56.036
What's the reason
why you don't play baseball?

41:56.040 --> 41:56.950
What?

41:57.120 --> 41:59.588
This is what the coach asked me
when I went into the KBO

41:59.960 --> 42:02.235
He asked me if I knew when
a baseball player's time is over

42:03.320 --> 42:06.710
He thinks that you're not interested in
playing baseball anymore

42:06.840 --> 42:08.796
He said you can fix a broken arm,
but you can't fix that

42:08.800 --> 42:09.994
He said that's the end

42:10.120 --> 42:14.238
Geez... He thinks he's so good

42:14.240 --> 42:16.356
Wake up to yourself!

42:18.120 --> 42:19.951
Don't you remember what you were like
in high school?

42:21.280 --> 42:23.157
You had a photo of Sun Dong-ryul
stuck on your locker

42:23.160 --> 42:24.639
You practiced pitching all night

42:24.640 --> 42:26.551
The number on your back
was always 18

42:28.720 --> 42:30.597
Getting to where you got to...

42:30.760 --> 42:32.990
You couldn't have done that unless
you were crazy about baseball

42:33.000 --> 42:35.434
Why do you keep talking
about the past?

42:35.440 --> 42:38.193
It's just because of you
I feel sorry for Cheol-su

42:38.560 --> 42:41.233
He was never much of an athlete

42:41.240 --> 42:42.912
But you're all he has

42:42.920 --> 42:44.148
He's never read a book
in his life,

42:44.160 --> 42:46.116
but he's going around
speaking English for you

42:46.120 --> 42:47.519
I can't bear seeing him like that

42:47.520 --> 42:48.509
Stop it

42:48.520 --> 42:49.953
Don't you remember what he did?

42:49.960 --> 42:53.111
He tried so hard to make you win
and his leg was smashed for good

42:53.120 --> 42:54.917
That's what got us our victory

42:55.280 --> 42:57.032
He still smiled the moment he saw you
in the hospital

42:57.040 --> 42:59.235
Stop it!
Just shut your mouth!

43:03.200 --> 43:05.191
Isn't it about time you grew up?

43:06.800 --> 43:09.268
You don't play baseball on your own

43:10.200 --> 43:12.395
You can't just quit by yourself

43:12.400 --> 43:13.594
I know!

43:13.840 --> 43:15.068
I know that!

43:15.480 --> 43:17.948
So stop lecturing me!

43:22.320 --> 43:25.312
Please leave your message
after the tone

43:26.120 --> 43:29.829
Cheol-su? I mean Charles!

43:29.960 --> 43:33.316
Do you remember me in high school?

43:34.680 --> 43:38.673
Did I really stick up a photo of
Sun Dong-ryul on my locker?

43:39.600 --> 43:44.549
Did I practice pitching all night?
Did I always wear number 18?

43:45.640 --> 43:48.438
Why is it that
I can't remember any of that?

43:49.160 --> 43:50.912
That's why I can't believe it

43:51.800 --> 43:54.360
Did I even like baseball?

43:55.320 --> 43:57.470
Was there ever such a time?

44:21.080 --> 44:23.469
His name is Cha Myeong... jae

44:23.480 --> 44:27.075
He was the best pitcher at the
- junior high baseball tournament 2 years ago

44:29.440 --> 44:31.112
Don't you remember what you were like
in high school?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.511
You had a photo of Sun Dong-ryul
stuck on your locker

44:34.520 --> 44:37.512
You practiced pitching all night
The number on your back was always 18

44:51.240 --> 44:55.074
Kim Sang-nam!
Now I remember

45:00.240 --> 45:03.755
Children, what are you doing?
Get to class quickly

45:03.920 --> 45:05.478
Come on, hurry up

45:07.520 --> 45:08.430
Hurry!

45:09.320 --> 45:18.797
God will look over us
Glory to our nation

45:19.520 --> 45:24.548
Mugunghwa, the land of Korea

45:25.040 --> 45:29.591
The beautiful scenery

45:30.520 --> 45:35.958
People of the land, as Koreans

45:36.120 --> 45:40.079
Preserve our beauty

45:42.320 --> 45:44.436
That was wonderful!

45:44.760 --> 45:46.796
Always think of the rhythm...

45:52.960 --> 45:54.439
What brings you here?

45:54.880 --> 45:58.190
We don't have a pitcher,
so I'm here to find one

45:59.120 --> 46:00.189
Where will you find them?

46:18.920 --> 46:20.797
Let's play baseball

46:28.280 --> 46:31.829
It's more fun playing with
others than playing on your own

46:54.320 --> 46:57.596
Kim Sang-nam... Kim Sang-nam...

47:07.360 --> 47:09.351
I'm not playing baseball

47:18.800 --> 47:21.109
I knew you'd say that

47:27.360 --> 47:28.270
Hello

47:54.280 --> 47:55.554
Impressive, isn't he?

47:59.640 --> 48:00.789
Raise it a little

48:02.200 --> 48:03.349
Down

48:03.800 --> 48:04.869
A little more

48:15.480 --> 48:16.469
Miss Nah!

48:19.240 --> 48:21.117
Just keep your glove where it is

48:21.400 --> 48:23.231
I'll place the ball
in there for you

48:31.960 --> 48:33.234
It hurts

48:36.800 --> 48:38.153
It really hurts

48:40.360 --> 48:41.679
I can't catch anymore

48:54.200 --> 48:55.349
Come here!

49:07.360 --> 49:09.271
You're jealous of me, right?

49:09.600 --> 49:11.397
This is nothing

49:11.560 --> 49:14.711
When I was your age,
I went to my rival to learn from him

49:15.080 --> 49:16.718
And I stripped everything off him

49:16.840 --> 49:18.558
I didn't leave him with anything

49:19.880 --> 49:20.995
How about it?

49:21.040 --> 49:22.837
Why not try to steal from me?

49:46.760 --> 49:48.557
What's wrong with you?

49:48.920 --> 49:50.956
You're the one who
said you didn't want to

49:51.240 --> 49:55.153
If you play baseball with them,
you'll just become one of them

49:55.160 --> 49:57.799
You said you didn't want that!

49:57.880 --> 50:00.314
But I want to pitch

50:00.320 --> 50:02.072
Don't use sign language!

50:02.440 --> 50:05.432
You're not like the other students

50:06.040 --> 50:10.795
You know how to speak
You can read lips now too

50:13.120 --> 50:17.398
You can live without anyone ever knowing
that you can't hear

50:17.400 --> 50:20.278
You can live like a normal person

50:25.040 --> 50:29.238
No! You are not
the same as them!

50:29.480 --> 50:34.429
Those kids couldn't hear or talk since
they were born or young...

50:34.440 --> 50:36.476
You're not like them

50:41.640 --> 50:43.437
Really?
He joined the baseball team?

50:43.440 --> 50:44.668
- Yes
- Wow

50:44.680 --> 50:47.069
Should we get started too then?
Let's go!

50:48.240 --> 50:51.277
Cha Myeong... jae -joins the baseball team!
To our first victory!

51:10.480 --> 51:11.356
That was good

51:26.720 --> 51:27.914
Really good

51:29.000 --> 51:29.989
He's the best

51:30.000 --> 51:31.274
He's really something

51:37.880 --> 51:40.440
We're going to win for the first time
at a national tournament

51:40.560 --> 51:42.039
I doubt it

51:44.480 --> 51:46.471
Baseball is a team sport

51:46.640 --> 51:48.949
But it's different in
a high school tournament

51:48.960 --> 51:51.428
The role of the pitcher
is really important

51:52.520 --> 51:54.511
Just gather the boys for me

52:14.920 --> 52:17.480
Keep going! Hang in there!

52:38.640 --> 52:40.471
You can have the catcher

52:40.960 --> 52:43.997
But keep your hands off the pitcher

52:49.160 --> 52:51.628
You're doing well
Hang in there a little longer

53:02.480 --> 53:04.391
Come on, that's enough now

53:10.440 --> 53:11.759
Goodness...

53:12.240 --> 53:13.958
Vice principal!

53:14.320 --> 53:17.278
I think coach Kim
is doing a great job

53:18.480 --> 53:19.595
Where are you going?

53:19.600 --> 53:22.114
To take care of those students who
are not on the baseball team

53:22.480 --> 53:23.674
What about me?

53:23.800 --> 53:25.438
You should look after the team

53:27.880 --> 53:30.394
- I don't like the side dishes
- Why not? They're good

53:30.400 --> 53:32.152
It's the same every day

53:33.200 --> 53:34.918
Hello

53:35.120 --> 53:36.109
Eat up

53:36.880 --> 53:38.154
I'm famished

53:44.120 --> 53:45.633
You're all running well!

54:03.200 --> 54:05.998
Stop it before they pass out

54:20.480 --> 54:21.549
Hang in there!

54:27.080 --> 54:31.471
Are you all right?

54:37.400 --> 54:39.118
Run a little faster

54:42.440 --> 54:43.475
Good!

54:47.960 --> 54:50.030
Keep your back down!
I said down!

54:54.040 --> 54:55.439
What are you doing?

55:01.520 --> 55:03.272
Hey, throw it properly

55:09.240 --> 55:10.434
Hey!

55:13.000 --> 55:14.797
Run! Run, run, run!

55:17.320 --> 55:18.639
Run, run, run!

55:19.880 --> 55:20.835
You're too slow!

55:22.480 --> 55:24.311
Stay alert and focused!

55:24.440 --> 55:26.396
First base,
keep your eyes on the ball

55:30.880 --> 55:33.110
Hey! Can't you even
catch that?

55:33.400 --> 55:34.799
- Throw it properly
- Next!

55:39.240 --> 55:40.514
Good! Nice work!

55:40.520 --> 55:41.839
It wasn't good

55:42.840 --> 55:45.115
Do you call that sliding?

55:47.760 --> 55:48.909
Everyone, come together

55:54.600 --> 55:56.511
Jin-man went to chase the ball

55:56.640 --> 55:58.471
Jong-Wu came in to cover the base

55:58.480 --> 56:00.789
What are your feet for?
Hold them up!

56:00.880 --> 56:02.996
Don't aim for the base
Hold them up and

56:03.000 --> 56:05.150
think that you're going
to kick him!

56:06.080 --> 56:08.469
You shouldn't teach the boys that

56:08.480 --> 56:10.914
You should teach them to play fair

56:11.240 --> 56:13.708
Who's going to play by the rules?
It's a war out there

56:13.840 --> 56:16.400
This is about the fighting spirit

56:16.600 --> 56:17.715
Back to your positions!

56:21.680 --> 56:22.669
Come here

56:29.040 --> 56:31.031
Do it like this, all right?

56:31.440 --> 56:32.190
Jong-Wu!

56:32.280 --> 56:34.271
Goodness! Are you all right?

56:34.400 --> 56:35.628
Get out!

56:35.920 --> 56:37.239
You get out!

56:37.240 --> 56:39.071
This isn't baseball,
it's a fight

56:40.080 --> 56:41.957
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

56:43.120 --> 56:44.633
Good, good!

56:44.960 --> 56:49.078
Looks like you're back to your
old high school self now

56:50.120 --> 56:53.032
Wow... You really fit in fast

56:53.160 --> 56:54.752
I've never seen you so determined

56:54.760 --> 56:56.398
I'm not determined

56:56.400 --> 56:58.038
I've got nothing better to do
with my time

56:58.760 --> 57:00.478
Just be a little
more patient, okay?

57:00.480 --> 57:02.789
I've pitched you to the Dodgers

57:02.960 --> 57:04.791
The Mets will get back to us soon

57:04.880 --> 57:06.154
What about LG Twins?

57:06.440 --> 57:08.078
No one's asking for me in Korea?

57:09.640 --> 57:13.394
Hey! You're Kim Sang-nam!

57:13.480 --> 57:16.040
We should aim higher than
the Korean league

57:16.600 --> 57:19.637
Word has gotten around that they
want you in the Major League

57:19.640 --> 57:21.676
They're starting to panic now

57:22.080 --> 57:23.354
Just you wait and see

57:23.880 --> 57:25.677
The day you stand
on the Dodgers' mound

57:25.960 --> 57:27.598
I'll be watching from the VIP seats

57:27.760 --> 57:31.594
I'll gather all the journalists and
team owners in the same spot

57:31.600 --> 57:33.875
I'll really let them have it!

57:34.120 --> 57:35.394
What is it?

57:35.680 --> 57:37.272
Aren't things going well?

57:38.280 --> 57:40.350
Come on...
Don't you trust me?

57:41.360 --> 57:43.828
I'm saying this
because I'm confident

57:43.840 --> 57:45.273
I'm really certain!

57:46.000 --> 57:47.718
Do you even eat properly?

57:48.080 --> 57:49.798
Regretfully so

57:50.280 --> 57:54.273
I eat sushi and
steak every single day

57:55.600 --> 57:57.272
Good for you then

57:57.280 --> 58:00.511
Sorry, I've resigned from the KBO
My replacement will be coming soon

58:04.440 --> 58:07.159
You're a little sentimental today

58:07.280 --> 58:09.191
What is it? Are you lonely?

58:09.360 --> 58:11.510
Should we go out dancing and
meet some girls then?

58:11.520 --> 58:13.033
Hey, I'm at a school

58:13.040 --> 58:14.837
Just drink quietly
and sleep over tonight

58:14.840 --> 58:16.114
I wish I could

58:16.560 --> 58:19.028
But I have to go back tonight
I have to meet someone

58:19.160 --> 58:20.479
At this hour?

58:22.080 --> 58:24.355
I need to keep you hot
while the ball's rolling

58:25.120 --> 58:28.669
You're a genius at baseball,
but clueless when it comes to business

58:29.280 --> 58:30.395
I have to go to the bathroom

58:46.080 --> 58:50.039
Come on... Pick up the phone

59:10.520 --> 59:12.829
I don't see a single body
out there

59:19.640 --> 59:21.631
You can't keep this up any longer

59:21.960 --> 59:24.235
You said you wanted them to enter
a national tournament

59:24.240 --> 59:25.753
You don't understand

59:25.880 --> 59:30.476
The boys have never been taught about
co-operation and making sacrifices

59:31.040 --> 59:33.031
It's hard enough for them to look
after themselves

59:33.040 --> 59:35.076
Telling them to scan the field,
come in for back-up

59:35.400 --> 59:37.709
No matter how much you scold them,
they won't understand you

59:37.800 --> 59:40.394
Then I need to train them
until they do understand

59:40.560 --> 59:42.437
Is this what baseball's about?

59:42.800 --> 59:45.553
They can't breathe, all you do
is shout and get mad at them

59:46.000 --> 59:47.991
Can't you let them
enjoy it a little?

59:48.080 --> 59:51.152
Do you know what the best way
to enjoy baseball is?

59:51.800 --> 59:54.394
You have to have the desire to win

59:54.440 --> 59:57.671
That helps you overcome the pain

59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.274
But those boys are different!

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.834
Good!

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.753
Teach them with that
look in your eyes

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.911
Baseball is a fight, you know

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.109
No, this is good enough
We have Myeong-jae now

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.913
Do you really think the pitcher is
going to solve all our problems?

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.959
Let's try it then!

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.313
Not junior high teams...

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.959
Let's meet some real players from
a national tournament

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.752
Let's battle it out!

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.432
Did you see what he's wearing?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.878
It's the same as our uniform

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.675
Communicate to them for me

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.470
To win a game in
a national tournament,

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.948
we must win against a team
who has played there

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.832
Our opponents today...

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.195
Made it to the semi-finals of last year's
tournament, Gunsan Commercial High

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.068
Let's go

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.715
Yes...

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.712
Vice principal,
should we just walk there?

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.239
Sorry...
The bus feels really heavy today

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.917
Attention! Bow!

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.117
Let's do it!

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.388
Play ball!

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.549
Strike!

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.997
Wow... It's worth hitting

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.875
Strike!

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.955
Strike!

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.518
Out!

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.915
Yes!

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.875
Nice!

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.439
Ball, ball, ball! Go! Run!

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.515
Time out!

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.718
Why aren't you throwing
what I signal?

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.154
Do you want to win?
Then follow me

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.477
No... I don't want us to win
just because of you

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.797
We're going to win this together

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.191
At least they have
the mind-set of pros

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.395
Whose side should we take?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.751
Tell him to do as the pitcher says

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.913
He'll find out soon enough

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.509
Do as the pitcher says

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.438
Ready... Play ball!

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.877
Gunsan Commercial High 5
Chung-ju Sacred Heart 0

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.115
Jong-Wu, be confident out there

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.869
Strike!

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.635
Strike!

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.999
Out!

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:30.876
Fool...

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.672
Swing! Out!

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.555
Out!

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.629
Go Gunsan!

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.790
Geez...

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.514
What's wrong with them?
Are they really a baseball team?

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.629
I know

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.749
Let's go!

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.589
Strike!

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.315
Strike!

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.755
Great!

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.715
That's good!

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.359
Out!

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.075
Swing!

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.872
- Yes!
- Nice pitch!

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.918
Out!

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.635
Strike!

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.390
Swing!

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.913
What are they doing?

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.549
Time out!

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.589
Time out!

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.594
You, get in here

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.718
What are you doing in the middle
of the game?

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.756
Does this even look
like a game to you?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.389
I'm sorry about this, sir

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.675
It's all right
You take care of it

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.148
Get out here

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.439
Come out, all of you!

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:29.919
What do you think you're doing?

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.398
We didn't come here to beg

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.756
I know that they're a lost cause
There isn't much hope for them

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.953
They can't hear the ball when it's hit,
so they have no sense of direction

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.675
They can't talk to
each other on the field

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.799
So you feel sorry for them?

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.270
It's just a practice game,
so you'll just let them have it?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.319
Well, I'm sorry

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.269
But they've worked just as hard
as you have to come here today

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.359
They didn't work that
hard to gain your pity

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.832
Why don't you just ridicule them?
At least that will get them mad

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.113
Maybe that will motivate
them to work harder

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:07.638
But this is all wrong
If you pity them, they'll lose spirit

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.796
Just step all over them

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.197
But don't steal their desire to get back up
Got that, you sons of bitches?

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.078
I'm sorry, sir
We will do our best

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.671
No cold game, just to the 5th

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.598
Step all over them if you want to

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.557
That's manners and
it will help them

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.117
Let's do our best out there
Gunsan Commercial High, let's go!

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.234
Let's go!

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.919
- That was quite impressive
- Geez... Stop following me

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.149
They'll think I was trying to
look tough in front of a woman

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.559
Man... How embarrassing

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.399
What are you on about?

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.393
You son of a bitch...

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.396
Out!

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.593
Out!

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.232
Gunsan Commercial High 8
Chung-ju Sacred Heart

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.229
Safe!

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.909
Safe!

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.796
Gunsan Commercial High 7
Chung-ju Sacred Heart

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.670
How far is it from here
to our school?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:07.955
Excuse me?

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.234
Boys, are you all right?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.711
Boys! Are you okay?

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.309
I think the boys are more determined
after the game

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.319
Even so, this is too much

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.272
Stop! Vice principal!

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.670
Are you all right?
Goodness...

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.148
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right? Can you hang in there?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.955
Goodness...

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.429
It's all right now, you're fine
Don't cry, it's okay

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.948
Tell them

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.190
Tell them to listen to me
as they rest

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.038
- No!
- Tell them!

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.316
This could be the last time

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.508
Having a good pitcher...
That doesn't change a thing

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.799
Baseball cannot be played
by the pitcher alone

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.958
I hope you were able to learn that
lesson in today's game

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.710
The most difficult opponent for us...

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.189
Isn't a strong team
that we can't win against

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.229
It's a team that pities us

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.831
If we meet a team like that,
we don't want to play hard

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.394
We lose the desire to fight

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.919
That is why!

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.274
We must show them that we're
not to be pitied

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.079
We're here!

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.110
We're going to break you to bits!

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.715
We're going to send you home!

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.996
Let's make them scared!

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.670
But we can't do it just
by looking at them

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.198
We need to shout!

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.432
So shout!

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.149
I know that you can't hear

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.877
I know you're scared that you may
sound strange too

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.908
But!

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.070
You don't just hear with your ears

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.349
Here!

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.759
Right here!

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.198
Shout!

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.957
Shout so that it echoes
in your hearts!

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.628
You fools!

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.559
You lost 32-0

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.351
You wanted to catch up,
but you failed

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.713
You were dying to win,
but you lost

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.032
You're furious about that

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.474
Have you already forgotten
how you cried?

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.877
You ran until you couldn't breathe

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.870
Think of the all the sweat
and hard work

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.669
Don't keep that bottled inside you
Let it out

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.519
Shout at them!

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.992
We're here!

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.835
We will destroy you

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.155
We're not afraid of you

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.194
We are proud of who we are

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.396
Step all over us

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.155
And we will rise again

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.909
You keep calling and visiting even though
we're not well acquainted

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.349
Is this the way everyone
is in your line of work?

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.878
He can't live without baseball

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.549
People say he rose to stardom because
he's naturally gifted

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.756
But they don't know that his right hand
has no fingerprints

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.038
That's what he's like

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.156
He would throw the ball until
his blisters broke...

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.316
He'd keep throwing even
before they healed

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.875
He used to scare me a lot
when we played together as kids

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.033
But I soon realized

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.551
If you're near someone
who loves baseball

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.117
You grow to love it too

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.356
Baseball is like a drug

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.997
You can't quit whenever you want to

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.273
He taught me that

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.672
What are you doing?

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.632
I've kneeled countless
times until now

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.272
I don't want to do that anymore

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.516
I'm never going to kneel again

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.670
Please...
Take favour on him this time

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.234
I'm late for a meeting,
so I'll keep it short

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:58.434
Nothing's been decided yet
If you want a tip-off...

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.829
It's not positive
That's all I have to say

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.119
President! President!
Wait, president!

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.551
Don't you think the children look
brighter because of the baseball team?

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.355
Wait!

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.991
They really have gotten brighter

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.156
I think your pitching style
is too big

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.429
That creates a greater risk of
runs being stolen

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.953
I know that

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.078
But I can't change it now

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.599
Of course you can't

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.599
I have an idea
Let's create our own sign

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.877
Once Su-min is far enough from
first base and ready...

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.075
I'll give you a sign

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.549
What kind of sign?

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.829
Look closely

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.239
I'll touch my eye

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.633
Then make a pick-off throw while
your foot's on the mound

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.309
What if I miss the ball?

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.031
That's why we have to practice

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.674
It could work
If I throw while my foot's down,

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.240
we're more likely to catch
the runner on first

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.194
I know! So watch me carefully

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.553
This is the sign

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.480
What are you doing?
Get running!

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.471
What are you doing? Hurry...
Hey... Wait...

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.079
Hey! Wait for me! Hey...

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.195
Isn't this great?

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.629
The air's so fresh up here,
isn't it?

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.675
The catcher must never
be afraid of the ball

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.074
Don't blink

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.673
Don't blink your eyes

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.149
What are they doing?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.991
I need to use the bathroom too

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.349
I'll go buy some drinks
for the boys

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.469
I'll go with you

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.833
Wow... You're rich

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.793
Come on, let's get back on the bus

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.472
- He has been charged for
- Let's go

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.199
leaving a basket
with an envelope of money

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.351
In addition,
in the KBO office this morning

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.679
The meeting for disciplinary
action against Kim Sang-nam was held

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.318
"Kim Sang-nam's agent is
under police investigation"
The meeting for disciplinary
action against Kim Sang-nam was held

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.639
"Kim Sang-nam's agent is
under police investigation"
The results will be announced shortly
Let's connect on location

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.074
The results will be announced shortly
Let's connect on location

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.435
The KBO committee
for disciplinary action

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.557
In response to the recent drunk
disorderly and assault case

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.632
KBO, permanent expulsion
of Kim Sang-nam
Of LG Twins' Kim Sang-nam,

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.269
according to article 144,
clause 3 of baseball regulations

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.994
Has decided to expel
him permanently

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.994
Kim Sang-nam has been involved
repeatedly in similar cases in the past

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.310
It is our decision that

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.438
he has defamed himself and is
no longer suitable to play in the league

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.079
Once police are able to
gain more evidence

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.308
regarding his agent, Jeong

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.153
They will review a warrant
for his arrest

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.798
Please leave your message...

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.237
Why don't you answer your phone?

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.030
I wanted to see how long it would take
for you to look for me

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.036
That's a kind of love test

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.714
It can be fun
if you use it once in a while

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.711
How was the food
at the police station?

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.070
You're always locked up
in there eating it

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.878
I wanted to try it myself and see
how good it tastes

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.029
So?

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.878
You don't have to eat it
anymore then?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.073
Yes, they said it's all
taxpayers' money

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.555
Why are you packing?
Did the Mets call? Do they want me?

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.751
I thought about that

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.399
I think the environment
there is really bad

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.595
You know how scary
New York is, right?

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.068
Even elementary school kids
carry guns over there

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.196
Could you really live
in a city like that?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.719
It's the Dodgers' farm team
in 3 months

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.357
You don't have much time
to prepare

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.279
I think you've been here
long enough

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.679
Let's get you to a hotel

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.392
You don't have to
pretend here anymore

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.148
Charles...

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.790
That's right, it's Charles
What is it?

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.436
Let's just stop it now

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.350
All you have to do is admit it

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.312
Stop what?

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.598
I admit that what I did was wrong

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.230
Something came over me then
I admit that

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.753
What do you mean by stop?

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.153
What? Getting expelled
from pro baseball?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.036
Okay, I admit that too

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.550
But that's the limitations
of this league

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.155
If they think someone's
better than them,

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.390
all they want to do
is tear them down

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.833
That's why

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.152
I've been kicked out now
I'm nothing, got that?

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.673
I'm so sick of this

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.636
I'm sick of trying to
get through to you

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.717
It's all right...
I know what you're like

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.349
You become stronger when you're
among the strong

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.396
Because you're like
the Lion King

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.155
But you're among hyenas now,
so you think you're a hyena too

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.794
Yes...

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.196
I was a good pitcher

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.396
I know you had faith in me

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.438
I know you ruined your leg so
you could get me a victory

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.554
That's why I played hard

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.152
But I'm tired now

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.390
I should try harder
because I owe it to you

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.358
But I want to rest now

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.952
Can't I do that?

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.118
Won't you allow it?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.195
Let's stop here, Cheol-su

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.631
Call me Charles

01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:00.950
He's the coach, yet he got drunk and
committed a crime

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.393
Besides, he's been
expelled permanently

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.119
We're not here to criticize him

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.077
The children's education is at stake
We should stick to our principles

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.475
That's what I want to
discuss with you today

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.832
How we should establish
our principles

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.518
Many students have become much brighter
due to our baseball team

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:33.310
But just doing
what the children want...

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.556
That's not a proper education either

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.114
That's why I want to
hear your opinions

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.109
Parents, please feel free
to voice your opinions

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.274
You...
Know how to read lips, right?

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:55.351
No matter how good the pitcher is,
you can't win in baseball

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.428
You may tie the game,
but you can't win

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.192
Because one day,
you'll get knocked down

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.518
So the first thing...

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.276
Trust your teammates

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.077
That's what they tell you in
the textbook

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.309
But when you're in a game

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.594
There comes a moment when
you must think that the pitcher

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.556
is the only one out there

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.832
When that time comes,
do what you think is right

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.629
There's no one standing
behind the catcher

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.558
But the pitcher has
7 teammates behind him

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.237
If you die,
the whole team dies

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.232
Bite into your teeth
and throw the ball

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.839
Don't forget that

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.116
Even in the tournament

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.393
What... What about you, coach?

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.714
What are you doing here?

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:28.193
This isn't an open meeting
Please go outside

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.393
I'm a little busy
I just came to say farewell

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.351
Farewell?

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:41.149
I'm sure you know that I was
here just to be pardoned by the KBO

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.832
It didn't work out

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:48.115
Regarding my position here,
all I have to say is screw you

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:55.954
Excuse me!
How dare you curse in here?

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.916
Screw that too

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.399
How dare you?

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.956
Can I ask you why you say that?

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.355
When I started coaching those boys,
I told them to trust nothing

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.071
An athlete must trust his own sweat
and nothing else

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.875
So they did that

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.677
To people who look down on them
and pity them...

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.629
I told them to scare them, defeat them
and send them back home

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.515
They did that too

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:31.636
Do you know what
those boys are doing now?

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.954
They're not out there in the field
that they're dying to run on

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.629
They've been locked up in a room
What do you think they're thinking about?

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.751
When living life,

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.355
sometimes others' decisions
can overpower their own desires

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.996
So they can't always do the things
that they want to do

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.516
They don't know that yet

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.715
But you want to
teach them that now

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.629
There's nothing positive about it,
but you want to give them a taste of that

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.595
If this is education,
then screw it

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.469
If this is a school,
then screw it too

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.674
If we're adults,
then screw us all

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.228
What?

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.677
Did I say something wrong?

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.793
What do you think will happen?

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:27.350
I don't know, but not everything will
go in our favour

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.915
Shouldn't we at least do something?

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.319
If you give us a
little more time, we can...

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.548
Principal!

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.238
Vice principal, the boys!

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.516
What is this all about?

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.831
Are these boys really our students?

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.069
Yes

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.510
Look at how strong they are now

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.914
They don't hide their emotions
or thoughts now

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.989
Despite what anyone else says,
these boys are the owners of the baseball team

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.550
What's gotten into you, Miss Nah?

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.513
You should restrain the students

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.953
I'm sorry, I can't do that

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.793
No... I won't do it

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.276
Why don't you try to
stop them yourself?

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.278
I'm not trying to be funny

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.918
Look into their eyes
It won't be easy to stop them now

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.390
I have to say goodbye first...

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.235
They need their coach

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.637
They're not good at baseball,
but they want to play

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.318
They love it

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.556
He says he will train harder

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.034
He says he will do
whatever you tell him

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.151
Please... He needs your help

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.237
He wants to be a baseball player

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.395
So he can live with his family

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.395
Coach Kim!

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.956
Coach Kim!

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.117
Coach Kim...

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:03.476
Seeing as we are all here, I will announce
the results of the board meeting

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.158
The operation of the baseball team and
its participation in the national tournament...

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.913
Has been approved

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:32.916
But Coach Kim informed that he will be
leaving our school today

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.317
I have asked him to remain with us...
But he hasn't given me an answer yet

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.878
Sang-nam, let's go

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:10.552
Do you still think about that?
About my leg injury?

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.477
Of course!
How could I forget that?

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:18.073
You think I got hurt
so you could win?

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.559
Successful people always think

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.552
that everything
revolves around them... Geez

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.277
Don't forget that I was the real star
of the tournament

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.188
It was 2 out in the ninth of the finals
Victory with a home steal

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.874
I was the one in the papers

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.629
So stop feeling sorry for me

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.238
Geez... You're making it worse

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.438
Live your life the way you
want to now

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.471
Being here reminded me of
when we were in high school

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.471
There's a boy here just like me

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.877
One just like you too

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.110
I didn't mind getting hurt as long as
it was for a friend

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.393
I'd forgotten all about how much
I really liked baseball

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.835
Does this look like
a school field to you?

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.954
It looks like City Field to me...
Dodgers' stadium too

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.633
Wow! You really adjust quickly
You really should be in the Majors

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.037
Should we start over again?

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.919
Really? Right now?

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.877
After the tournament

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.115
You got it!

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.399
What are you doing, boys?

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.356
We don't have much time left!

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.392
Get moving right this minute!

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.395
Goodness...
When did they prepare all this?

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:25.517
Let's have a big clean-up session once
the baseball team leaves

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.878
Our boys like meat, don't they?

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.312
Let them have as much as they like

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.113
Principal...

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.077
Hurry off now
We have to start clean-up

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.151
Yes, you do that

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.833
See you later then

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:10.030
You know that I like you, right?

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.510
My first home run is for you

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.157
I promise

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.872
The students seem a
little too bright now

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.073
Good luck

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.435
Thank you

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.389
I'm sorry about that

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.879
Where did you go?

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.998
I needed to find a marker
Let's go

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.231
Yes, let's go then

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.199
Dreams can come true!
- Kim Sang-nam

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.629
Please don't do this...

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.708
United Airlines, duty free

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.076
It tastes different
depending on the origin

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:45.510
You don't have to do this...

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.913
What do you see?

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.714
Mountains...

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.995
Rocks and trees too?

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.071
No, there's nothing here

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.076
So there's nowhere for you to hide

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.110
Even if you're ashamed,
or if you feel small...

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.796
There's nowhere to hide out there

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.039
So don't hide

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.310
Play as you are
Trust nothing but your own sweat

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.714
Do you know that
love exists in baseball?

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.032
Yes, to appear like that

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.190
Yes, that's good

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.879
Play ball!

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.592
Strike!

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.959
Safe!

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.788
Out!

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.114
He missed the ball!
Run home!

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.789
Safe!

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.075
40th National High School
Baseball Tournament

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.149
As we speak, both teams are
entering the stadium

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.628
Sacred Heart's hearing
impaired players

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.358
It's their first
national tournament

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.237
That's right. They must be nervous

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:08.196
Their first opponent

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.668
is Gunsan Commercial High
The two teams have played once before

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.351
That's right

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:14.318
But the results were 32 - 0
They were thrashed

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.230
They must've been upset

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:19.756
In their first national tournament,
they once again face Gunsan

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.556
That's right

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:23.677
You can make a mistake out there
But don't feel sorry about it

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.316
Watch the ball to the end

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.910
If the ball comes to your body,
just get hit

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.954
It's not going to kill you,
all right?

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.837
They made it themselves

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:44.359
Feel with the heart!
National tournament first win!

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:48.996
Batter up!

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.235
Play ball!

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.270
Safe!

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:07.870
Good work

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.312
Out!

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.350
Run around!

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.275
Third base!

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.353
Sacred Heart are running the bases well
and are picking the correct balls

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:40.796
That's right. Now they have a chance
to get on the scoreboard first

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.995
They have to make it home
with this one

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.559
He's hit it!
It's flying far in the center

01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.789
- Over the right fielder
- Run around, run

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.631
The ball rolls to the fence

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.630
Run!

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.790
The runner on third makes it home
First also makes it home

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.353
The batter gets a triple
He's on 3rd base now

01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:00.995
Wow... I think Sacred Heart may
surprise us all today

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.959
I thought they would lose for sure,
but they seem very focused

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.550
The pitcher from Gunsan has
underestimated his opponent

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.356
Stay focused!

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.157
I think this will prove to be
a very interesting game

01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.309
I think so

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:14.915
3 out!

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.753
Sacred Heart is ahead 2-0
as we finish the inning

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:20.995
Are they the same team
that we played last time?

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.911
I know... Geez

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:28.032
Chances comes when you fall into danger
Gunsan will get their chance soon

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.712
Cha Myeong-jae to pitch

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:32.951
He was a great pitcher
in junior high

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.712
But he hasn't played
for a long time

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.518
He has probably
lost touch out there

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.593
He doesn't want Gunsan's first batter
to get on base

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.235
That pitch was a little high

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.753
The ball falls in front
of the left fielder

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.753
I thought he would've lost his touch
That ball was a little high

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.718
He's hit it! It's good
It's heading to the fence

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.430
It's gone to the back

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.273
The left fielder has lost the ball

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.439
The contact sound determines
where you should stand

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.271
It's gone over the left fielder

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:09.637
Outfield play is very difficult for
players who can't hear

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:21.832
He's hit it
It's deep to center

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.395
It's gone over the center fielder

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:27.991
Gunsan makes it a tie
with consecutive grounders

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.072
Cha Myeong-jae has
to stay focused here

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.758
The ball's gone through again

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:04.958
Gunsan is really good
They don't miss a chance

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.279
They're one of the best teams out there

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:09.477
Gunsan has scored high in the first inning
to overtake their opponents easily

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:11.198
They're ahead 5-2

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.511
Looks like Sacred Heart has met
a team that's too strong for them

01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:16.396
Sacred Heart 2/ Gunsan 5
Looks like Sacred Heart has met
a team that's too strong for them

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.549
Sacred Heart 2/ Gunsan 5
I think so

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.512
Here's to a cold game

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:21.112
Cheers!

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.233
Swing! Out!

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.872
Out!

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.911
As the innings progress,
Cha Myeong-jae's pitch speed...

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.956
And ball movement
keep getting better

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.793
That's right
At the end of the first inning...

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.110
We expected a cold game,
but thanks to Cha Myeong-jae...

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.918
His control,
speed are all coming back

01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:01.196
If the rest of the team
can defend well...

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.795
Who knows what the results
of this game will be?

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.677
- Out!
- That's a strikeout

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:22.513
Cha Myeong-jae gets a strikeout
with the bases loaded

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:26.195
3 out and now changeover
Gunsan loses their chance to score

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.919
Wow... He just threw a splitter

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.037
That's a tough ball for
a high-school student

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.395
I bet Kim Sang-nam taught him that

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.435
I'm sure he did

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.349
That was great!

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.995
He takes the hit
He didn't dodge

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.798
I wouldn't dodge either right now

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.031
Did you see how he just let
the ball hit him?

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.917
He must be very focused

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.593
It would've hurt, but he smiles as
he takes first base

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:59.034
Jo Jang-hyeok, the first pitch!
It's a clean hit!

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.159
It's going through the center
That's a great course

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.039
Jo Jang-hyeok!
On his way to second

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.794
Wow, this is amazing!
Sacred Heart is really good!

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.995
Who would've imagined?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.958
This shows how much they want to win

01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:18.793
It shows how determined they are to
gain their first victory

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:19.676
The score is 5-4

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:22.274
Sacred Heart catches up

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.669
They're really surprising
everyone here

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.319
Are you with Gunsan?

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.548
Yes, right...

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:36.589
They have Kim Sang-nam!
He's the best player in Korea

01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:40.549
Look what he's done with these kids
Isn't he amazing?

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.676
What if we lose?

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.352
Don't you dare say that!

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.238
Stop drinking and just cheer

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.755
Yes, our boys can't lose to a bunch
of deaf kids

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:51.318
Geez... Watch it!

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.789
They're hearing impaired

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.388
- Yes... Just watch the game
- Hearing impaired?

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.677
He's hit it! Through the center!
That's a good course

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.310
The batter rounds second to third

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.914
The ball is relayed
Now on third...

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.315
He's safe!

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:13.238
Sacred Heart is
catching up really fast

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.549
They seem determined to win

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.155
Gunsan appears to be very flustered

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.633
I'm sure they are

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.030
Chungju Sacred Heart is a totally
different team today

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.476
He's hit it!
An infield grounder

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:28.750
He shouldn't run home
He won't make it

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.235
Safe!

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.229
Yes!

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.151
Safe! He's safe!

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.669
Sacred Heart has tied 5-5

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.189
Their cheer squad is
really fired up now!

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.634
We were able to see
a magical play at home

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:57.111
Wow! Sacred Heart players are really
challenging themselves now

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:01.079
Gunsan isn't happy with the call,
but it was safe

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.995
He didn't pass the 3 feet line
He went over the catcher's head

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:06.716
That's right

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:10.679
It was safe
This is going to make the evening news

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:14.952
Now the game atmosphere has totally
swung over to Sacred Heart

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:18.509
Sacred Heart! Sacred Heart!
Sacred Heart!

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.271
I love you boys!

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:27.079
If you lose, you'll be running all
the way back to school, got that?

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.389
Yes!

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:40.795
Gunsan! Gunsan! Gunsan! Gunsan!

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:45.033
Gunsan and Sacred Heart are
at it neck and neck

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.031
Bottom of the eight,
Gunsan to attack

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:49.952
He's the most decisive
player of today's game

02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:53.191
Cha Myeong-jae has thrown more than
100 pitches already

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.432
But Sacred Heart has
no other pitcher

02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:01.030
He has no choice
He has to lead his team to the end

02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:09.437
He's hit it!
A grounder between first and second

02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.113
Runner rounds second

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.312
Right fielder takes the ball

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.389
Now at home...

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.078
He runs in easily. Safe!

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.830
The batter on first... Safe!

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.473
Nice work!

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.955
Gunsan manages to take over

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.715
I think he has reached his limit

02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:34.794
He's thrown 123 pitches already
and he's getting weaker as we speak

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.678
If they allow another score here...

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.513
It won't be easy for
Sacred Heart to win

02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:59.950
He fakes a pick-off throw

02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.117
He looks very tired

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.830
I think it's hard for him to even
be standing on the mound right now

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.352
A pick-off throw to first again!

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:16.516
Out!

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.476
They got him! Wow!

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:23.395
Kim on first and Cha
moved like one body just now

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:26.312
If the ball went past the base...

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:29.750
Or if he was slow to cover the base
and the pitcher didn't throw on time

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.159
That would be a balk

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:31.910
That's right

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.790
That was a brave play by Cha
It shows that he trusts his teammate

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:42.390
Top of the ninth,
Sacred Heart's final chance at bat

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.709
Number 4, Jang Dae-gun is standing

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:53.438
He's hit it! It's a big hit!
It's flying through the outfield!

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.318
The right! To the right!

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:58.030
It's gone over!

02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.156
It's a homerun!

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.269
A dynamic homerun ties the game

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.159
Bottom of the ninth, 2 out
Sacred Heart is in danger

02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.950
They don't need a big hit here
An infield grounder can finish the game

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:35.991
He's hit it!
The ball bounces off the pitcher's glove!

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.753
Is the game going to end here?

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.915
Out!

02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:51.997
- You did it!
- It's out!

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.672
The shortstop has caught the ball

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.671
It's not over yet

02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.715
Thanks

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:03.191
I'm the only shortstop we have
Don't mention it

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.591
Kim's catch saves Sacred Heart

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:11.113
This is like a miracle

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.113
Just going overtime against Gunsan...

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.233
Sacred Heart! They've created
a miracle in this tournament

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:20.389
That's right

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:23.713
Wait... What's going on here?

02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.109
Do we still have
spectators like that?

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.674
An excited spectator has
run out on to the field

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.591
The game is delayed momentarily

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.876
He shouldn't do that
at such an important time

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.709
Okay, all right! I'm going!
Let go of me!

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.678
- I'm going! I am!
- Geez...

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.915
Our boys need to rest

02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:59.915
Don't look at me that way

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.438
I'm not the only one throwing the ball

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.795
Let's stop
There's always next time

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:23.994
No!

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:35.033
Stop!

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.914
If something goes wrong, you'll never
be able to throw another ball

02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:41.433
Do you know something?

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:45.711
When you're in a game

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:50.750
There comes a moment when I have to think
that I'm the only one out there

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:59.033
When that time comes,
I have to decide

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.671
That time is now

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:06.799
I have my teammates with me

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:13.791
I want to grit my teeth
and keep throwing

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.112
I heard them

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.634
I heard the spectators shout
Here!

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.990
I want to win more than
anything else

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:47.155
Even if this is the end...

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:50.517
Something inside me...

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.633
From here

02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:57.354
It's coming up from here

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:02.475
I want to burn it all away

02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:21.473
Then that's what we have to do

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.073
We came here from 32-0

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.633
Now, let's tear them to bits

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.639
We've arrived!

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.396
We're going to destroy you!

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.350
We're going to send you home!

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.669
Let's go!

02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:57.392
Victory is ours!

02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.639
Let's go!

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.435
Get him down

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:10.555
I'm not going! I'm not going!

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.232
Carry him off the field!

02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:14.996
Gunsan!

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.353
Gunsan, let's go!

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:19.995
Sacred Heart!

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:21.314
Let's go!

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:54.916
Out!

02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.030
Out!

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:04.956
Safe!

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:22.670
Out!

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:31.955
Out!

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:45.074
Double, double!

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.350
Out!

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.236
- Gunsan!
- Gunsan, let's go!

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.509
Let's go!

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:10.874
Let's go!

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:36.956
He's hit it!

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.916
It's gone past second

02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.838
Cha Myeong-jae has
thrown well until now

02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:46.354
He needs to remain calm now

02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.400
It's a clean hit
It goes between first and second

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:06.234
Runner on first heads to third

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.038
Safe at third
Gunsan has a chance to score

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.550
Sacred Heart have to
be careful here

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:16.997
They're in danger,
but they've done well until now

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.109
You come this way
The space is too wide

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.113
You should come to my side

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.633
The ball keeps coming this way

02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.235
No, wait!

02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:46.392
Pitcher balk!
U, one base!

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.991
It's a balk!
Who would've imagined this?

02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:55.153
Is this how the game is going to end?

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:58.318
Cha Myeong-jae has pitched 12 innings

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.954
A balk...
That's a first for this tournament

02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:03.428
I don't know what to say

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.034
What is it?

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:13.234
A pitcher balk... We lost

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:30.395
We lost because
our pitcher made a mistake

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.516
I'm sorry

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.479
I'm sorry

02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:25.555
I'm the one who's sorry

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:31.473
It's okay, don't feel sorry

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.995
You all did well

02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.072
There's always next time

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.672
You can win next time

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:48.148
It's all right

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:49.998
You did well

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.913
You did really well, everyone

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.476
You really blew everyone away

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:57.632
You did well, don't cry

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.157
You did great!

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:04.518
I'm really proud of you

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.838
You were great

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.079
You boys are wonderful

02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:18.596
Next time, we will win

02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:02.198

Kim Sang-nam chooses challenge over money
Trials for Japanese team, Orix

02:18:28.559 --> 02:18:31.074
Why isn't there
a single journalist here?

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:33.031
Would you come to interview me?

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:34.989
I guess you're right

02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.029
Boys! You should've told me
you were coming

02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.311
They wanted your signature

02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:02.516
We wanted to win before we asked

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:10.989
But we're still qualified
to have your signature

02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:16.596
I don't think
I'm qualified to sign it

02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:37.713
Why do I have to park the bus?

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.673
I know that you said you're fussy

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.434
But I thought you should say goodbye

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:19.910
Vice principal,
to tell the truth...

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:25.752
The coach is fussy,
but he should say bye

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.433
I'm not... I'm not fussy

02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.237
Really?
Then how about Miss Nah...

02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:36.719
I'm fussy

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:40.352
I'm picky

02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:45.829
Really? I'm sorry, Miss Nah

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:47.273
Sorry for what?

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.510
Because she said she's picky

02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.431
Who is she to pick and choose?

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:54.513
I can pick whoever I want

02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:55.669
Hey!

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.797
What? What?

02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:00.394
Please... The boys are watching

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:06.268
Miss Nah told the
coach to apologize

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:09.955
But the vice principal
apologized instead

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.077
The coach is saying he can't

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:19.478
What is he telling them?

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:23.474
That you suit each other

02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:24.993
Vice principal!

02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:54.592
Our love goes to Sacred Heart baseball team
who are still running towards their first victory

02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:58.957
