00:01.294 --> 00:07.425
J " Gloriana J".

00:13.848 --> 00:20.021
J " Gloriana J".

00:26.444 --> 00:33.326
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J".

00:42.710 --> 00:48.549
<i>S'?</i>

01:10.112 --> 01:12.240
What fun we had doing these.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.242
Look at this one.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.493
How young you look, Albert.

01:15.660 --> 01:16.702
Well, that was

01:16.869 --> 01:18.037
before I was the father to...

01:18.204 --> 01:19.956
seven children.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.501
That's you when
you were a baby, Vicky.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.503
Who's that nursemaid holding me?

01:25.670 --> 01:27.380
That's me, silly!

01:27.546 --> 01:29.548
Oh, Vicky is right,

01:29.715 --> 01:31.342
you don't look like a queen
at all.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.509
Of course I don't.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.348
Mama, look,

01:37.515 --> 01:39.159
Bertie is trying to put a marble
up Affie's nose.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.726
Affie, stay still.

01:40.893 --> 01:41.893
Right.

01:43.771 --> 01:44.771
Bertie.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.608
Bertie?

01:48.651 --> 01:50.236
Do you wish to hurt
your brother?

01:50.403 --> 01:52.405
It's an experiment, Papa.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.032
Ah-ah. Bertie,
leave your brother alone at once!

01:55.199 --> 01:56.450
Sit over there, Bertie.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.244
Sit!

01:58.411 --> 01:59.787
Vicky,

01:59.954 --> 02:01.539
I want you take your brothers

02:01.706 --> 02:03.124
and sisters back to the nursery,

02:03.291 --> 02:05.501
your mama's not feeling
very well.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.962
Is the new baby
making her feel cross?

02:08.129 --> 02:09.856
I don't understand
why she keeps getting them.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.300
I'm sure
she'll feel better soon.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.066
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with me.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.768
<i>S'?</i>

02:22.935 --> 02:26.188
The new coin would
be worth a tenth of a pound.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.691
It is a step towards introducing

02:28.858 --> 02:31.527
a modern decimal system.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.946
Ah, well, we have ten fingers
after all.

02:34.113 --> 02:35.823
Seems like
the most logical system.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.908
Yes, but there's something
so irritating

02:38.075 --> 02:39.535
about the decimal point.

02:39.702 --> 02:42.872
12 is a number that likes
to be divided. Ten isn't.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.665
Yes, but the decimal system

02:44.832 --> 02:48.044
works perfectly well
on the Continent.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.379
Perhaps they're better
at long division.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.589
A new coin

02:51.756 --> 02:53.758
deserves a new image.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.052
It is an opportunity
to put something beautiful

02:56.218 --> 02:57.511
in the pocket of the people.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.430
I would like to have a hand
in its design,

02:59.597 --> 03:00.931
if <i>I</i> may?

03:01.098 --> 03:02.475
Certainly, sir.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.019
And what do you think
we should call the new coin?

03:05.186 --> 03:07.146
Totally unnecessary.

03:07.313 --> 03:10.191
Ah, Uncle Leopold.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.859
You have arrived just in time.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.154
That is my specialty.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.405
We need a name

03:16.572 --> 03:19.033
for the new decimal coin.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.661
In Europe
we would call it a florin.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.705
Excellent suggestion,
Your Majesty.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.667
A name that works both at home
and abroad.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.087
Uncle Leopold, let me present
my prime minister.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.255
And this is my...

03:33.422 --> 03:35.049
foreign secretary.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.094
Oh, Lord Palmerston needs
no introduction.

03:46.769 --> 03:51.440
I am delighted to have made such
an impression, Your Majesty.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.651
First you undermine
my authority,

03:53.818 --> 03:55.986
then you are insolent
to King Leopold.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.321
No one is indispensable!

03:57.488 --> 03:59.573
No, indeed, prime minister.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.860
One day you will go too far.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.743
And then I will be the one

04:02.910 --> 04:06.247
with the idiotic grin
on my face.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.584
Your Serene Highness,
what an unexpected pleasure.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.379
Official business?

04:13.546 --> 04:15.756
There is to be a ball
for the christening,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.259
in the fashions
of the last century.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.929
Will I valuable enough to
receive an invitation, I wonder?

04:22.096 --> 04:26.475
That remains to be seen.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.562
Invites are for valuable member
of society.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.159
All I ask is that
you look at me,

04:43.325 --> 04:44.535
like you did in Ireland.

04:48.831 --> 04:52.418
I may be wearing livery,
but I am the same man.

04:52.585 --> 04:53.711
Nothing has changed.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.632
Exactly, I'm still married.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.927
To a man
who's not worthy of you.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.220
Would you like me to arrange

05:03.387 --> 05:07.183
for an oil lamp by the piano,
Your Grace,

05:07.349 --> 05:08.767
if there's not enough light?

05:08.934 --> 05:12.521
I'm worried that Joseph here
might spill...

05:12.688 --> 05:14.899
wax on you.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.329
<i>S'?</i>

05:28.496 --> 05:30.873
Arthur.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.209
Alice.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.211
Helena.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.504
Affie.

05:38.422 --> 05:43.677
Of course you remember
Bertie and Vicky.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.447
Please accept this book
of etchings, Uncle Leopold,

05:45.471 --> 05:46.791
to keep us near your heart
always.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.140
Oh.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.434
How like your dear father
you are,

05:50.601 --> 05:52.811
my dear.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.438
Bertie.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.857
Make a bow to Uncle Leopold.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.360
Oh, it is a mouse.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.529
And the Prince of Wales,
however,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.906
takes after
the other side of the family.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.242
Yes, that is what I always say.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.410
Bertie is a Hanoverian.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.794
Uncle.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.339
Don't you recognize Feodora?

06:20.506 --> 06:22.299
Uh...

06:23.968 --> 06:25.688
Why, she practically lives
next door to you.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.055
Feodora, of course.

06:40.693 --> 06:44.697
What an unexpected pleasure
to see you here, Duchess.

06:46.282 --> 06:50.494
I know how busy you are
at the palace.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.581
The queen has been...

06:53.747 --> 06:55.499
out of sorts since the birth.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.746
She likes to have me on hand,
and I can hardly refuse.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.589
Indeed.

07:04.049 --> 07:09.179
How pleasant for you, my dear,
to have such powerful friends.

07:11.015 --> 07:14.226
Ah, of course, you are right
at the center of things.

07:14.393 --> 07:17.688
The prime minister and
Lord Palmerston are always

07:17.855 --> 07:21.775
at the palace, are they not?

07:23.777 --> 07:27.281
Yes, they do come and go,
rather.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.657
Hmm.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.135
Well, I, I have been giving
some thought

07:30.159 --> 07:33.329
to your costume
for the christening.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.998
You have?

07:36.165 --> 07:38.167
I think you should go
as my grandmother,

07:38.334 --> 07:40.586
the ninth duchess.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.213
She was painted by Gainsborough.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.216
I have a, a miniature here.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.682
Oh, she's lovely.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.393
Sold.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.395
Like so many things.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.445
Until you restored
the family fortunes...

08:08.489 --> 08:09.615
My dear.

08:16.330 --> 08:20.834
<i>S'?</i>

08:21.001 --> 08:23.128
"President of the Society

08:23.295 --> 08:27.508
for the Improvement
of the Laboring Classes."

08:27.675 --> 08:29.385
Hmm.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.971
This country is lucky to have
such an industrious prince.

08:33.138 --> 08:37.643
Well, there is still so much

08:37.810 --> 08:39.478
to do.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.146
Three years ago I thought

08:41.313 --> 08:42.833
that this country would go
the same way

08:42.981 --> 08:44.733
as France, but...

08:44.900 --> 08:48.070
well, it seems that the English,
they may grumble,

08:48.237 --> 08:51.699
but they do not come
to the boil.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.950
Mm-hmm.

08:53.117 --> 08:54.451
It is the weather, I think.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.371
It is hard to lead a revolution
in the rain.

09:02.876 --> 09:08.716
I am so proud of you, Albert.

09:12.553 --> 09:15.013
Well, I had a good teacher.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.102
Ah,

09:20.269 --> 09:22.020
Bertie get back to bed at once.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.667
I can't get to sleep
without my mouse,

09:23.814 --> 09:24.940
and I can't find it

09:25.107 --> 09:26.650
anywhere.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.610
Oh, there you are Bertie.
Oh, what a child.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.255
I have been looking
for him everywhere. Come on.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.279
I want my mouse.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.906
Then come with me.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.617
I have it safe.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.661
Feodora,

09:37.828 --> 09:39.163
you are like the pied piper.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.166
You cannot imagine, Uncle,

09:42.332 --> 09:45.085
how fortunate we have been
to have Feodora here as of late.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.095
No, no matter what I do,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.097
Bertie will be my legacy.

10:00.350 --> 10:04.480
I love him so very much,
but can you imagine him as king?

10:04.646 --> 10:07.816
He is your son.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.735
He will not disappoint.

10:11.570 --> 10:12.362
<i>S'?</i>

10:12.529 --> 10:13.781
<i>London News?</i>

10:13.947 --> 10:16.950
Sir.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.494
<i>London News, mate'?</i>

10:18.660 --> 10:23.916
<i>S'?</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:26.627
What are you all gossiping
about?

10:34.426 --> 10:39.306
<i>S'?</i>

11:06.416 --> 11:08.126
<i>Gott in Himmel.</i>

11:09.670 --> 11:10.796
What is it?

11:18.011 --> 11:21.014
Our private pictures!

11:21.181 --> 11:23.308
The printer must have sold
the etching plates.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.309
They were private.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.687
<i>Was fur ein Schwein.</i>

11:26.854 --> 11:29.481
Oh, my poor sister, I hope...

11:29.648 --> 11:31.984
I hope you will not upset
yourself too much.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.237
<i>S'?</i>

11:35.404 --> 11:37.906
What's wrong with a mother
giving her baby a bath?

11:38.073 --> 11:42.786
Even a woman with your political
opinions, Miss Turner,

11:42.953 --> 11:45.455
must understand that
what this country needs

11:45.622 --> 11:49.001
is a sovereign,
not Mrs. Bun the baker's wife.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.591
<i>S'?</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:06.184
Lam going to cancel the ball.

12:08.979 --> 12:13.692
I won't have them...
laughing at me.

12:13.859 --> 12:18.572
Victoria, I know this is...

12:18.739 --> 12:20.574
a difficult time

12:20.741 --> 12:24.286
at the moment, but try,

12:24.453 --> 12:26.038
try to keep things
in perspective.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.016
It's easy for you to say,
no one is laughing at you.

12:28.040 --> 12:28.832
Well, on the contrary,

12:28.999 --> 12:30.417
laughing at me, it is a...

12:30.584 --> 12:33.503
a national pastime.

12:38.008 --> 12:42.220
I was...
I was so looking forward

12:42.387 --> 12:44.306
to starting my, my duties again,

12:44.473 --> 12:46.558
and...

12:46.725 --> 12:48.185
now what are people
going to see?

12:51.396 --> 12:54.149
They are going to see a woman.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.195
Not a queen. As...

12:58.362 --> 13:02.824
As Feodora said, it will pass.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.368
Hmm.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.675
I must thank you
for the invitation to the ball.

13:19.841 --> 13:23.053
Mrs. Hudson is most grateful,
Your Serene Highness.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.930
I am used to the rough
and tumble,

13:25.097 --> 13:26.556
but she...

13:26.723 --> 13:28.850
well, she feels the lack
of society

13:29.017 --> 13:31.728
most keenly.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.855
I'll take my leave.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.844
I seem to have scared
Mr. Hudson off.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.991
You do know the man's
a swindler?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.494
He even sold empty
railway shares to his valet.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.222
I'm surprised to see you riding
with one another.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.248
I am surprised
you're not at the palace

13:51.415 --> 13:52.666
with the prime minister.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.268
Well, I did offer, but
the prime minister thought

13:54.292 --> 13:55.544
he could manage better alone.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.629
And I am sure he's right.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.065
But it would be
very inconvenient

13:59.089 --> 14:02.259
if they discovered
a common enemy.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.302
It's a mighty fine bay
you have there.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.222
Must have cost a pretty penny.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.390
Royal stable?

14:08.557 --> 14:09.637
It belongs to me, actually.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.976
Ah.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.729
A gift, perhaps,

14:13.895 --> 14:15.856
from one of your many admirers.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.458
Is your wife coming
to the ball, I wonder?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.860
She doesn't like
the hurly-burly of politics.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.903
Ah. Pity.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.072
A man like you needs an ally.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.164
I am not sure

14:32.330 --> 14:33.707
it is a criminal matter, ma'am.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.001
The printer has sold impressions
of your etchings,

14:36.168 --> 14:39.129
but that in itself
is not illegal.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.047
You asked him to make prints.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.258
The only recourse
is to sue for damages.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.468
Damages?

14:44.634 --> 14:46.094
To your reputation, ma'am.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.639
Lord John, my dignity does not
have a price.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.183
Quite so, which is
why legal action

14:51.349 --> 14:52.851
- would be inadvisable.
- But...

14:53.018 --> 14:54.328
There must be something
we can do.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.772
I understand your distress...

14:56.938 --> 14:58.666
<i>Distress? Lord John,
it is more than distress,</i>

14:58.690 --> 14:59.941
it is treason.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.861
I am not sure that
a judge would agree with you.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.988
They are, after all,

15:05.155 --> 15:06.323
family scenes.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.074
What do you suggest?

15:08.241 --> 15:12.287
Regrettably,
there is nothing you can do

15:12.454 --> 15:15.373
except perhaps to choose
your printer with more care.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.293
Are you suggesting
this debacle is our fault?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.337
Oh, no, ma'am, it's just that...

15:20.504 --> 15:23.173
This audience is at an end,
Prime Minister.

15:25.509 --> 15:29.179
Mousey, mousey.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.639
Do you want to go in?

15:30.806 --> 15:31.890
Do you like your new house?

15:32.057 --> 15:33.558
Bertie?

15:36.561 --> 15:37.646
Why are you not in lessons?

15:37.813 --> 15:39.564
I was bored. Yes, well,

15:39.731 --> 15:42.317
sometimes in life we have to do
things we do not wish to do.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.069
Then I hope Mama dies soon,

15:44.236 --> 15:47.280
so I can be king,
and I can do anything I want.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.782
That is a,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.868
a terrible thing to say, Bertie!

15:52.035 --> 15:54.037
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.084
Come here.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.009
Off you go.

16:08.176 --> 16:14.933
<i>S'?</i>

16:15.100 --> 16:17.769
Bertie is so like Drina
at that age.

16:17.936 --> 16:21.231
Makes me wonder
if his temper is congenital.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.158
Of course, I know nothing
about these things,

16:23.191 --> 16:26.987
but perhaps an expert might.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.366
How can your
people believe in this

16:31.533 --> 16:35.245
when they can see you here
looking like this?

16:35.412 --> 16:38.832
Monarchy needs to be shrouded
in mystery,

16:38.999 --> 16:43.295
not paraded
as a public spectacle.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.130
A man's imperfections

16:45.297 --> 16:47.048
are considered part
of his character,

16:47.215 --> 16:51.970
whereas a woman's flaws are
evidence of her unsuitability.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.723
Your image here,

16:54.890 --> 16:59.060
Would it not be more regal

16:59.227 --> 17:00.729
if you were wearing a crown?

17:00.896 --> 17:02.439
Yes.

17:02.606 --> 17:06.234
But on coins, the monarch
is always bareheaded.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.778
But you are the exception,
Victoria,

17:08.945 --> 17:10.488
in so many ways.

17:21.291 --> 17:26.338
<i>S'?</i>

17:31.134 --> 17:33.345
What are you wearing
to the ball, Sophie?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.888
I am sworn to secrecy, ma'am.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.875
You can't have any secrets
from me.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.979
I am going as
the ninth Duchess of Monmouth,

17:43.146 --> 17:45.774
after the Gainsborough portrait.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.151
It was, um, my husband's idea.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.653
The ninth duchess,

17:49.819 --> 17:52.280
wasn't there some story

17:52.447 --> 17:54.783
about her?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.702
I suppose it's nice that
the duke takes such an interest.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.914
I suppose so, ma'am.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.939
Well, at least I look like
a queen

18:07.963 --> 18:09.881
in this.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.342
Oh, those terrible pictures.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.552
Ooh.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.973
If you feel you can't face
the world, Drina,

18:18.139 --> 18:21.101
lam sure Albert
and I could manage.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.353
Oh, I am sure
you would like nothing more

18:23.520 --> 18:26.022
than to announce to the world
I'm unable to fulfill my duties.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.693
I'm only trying to support you,
Drina.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.415
Your Grace.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.667
I overheard he wants you
to go to the ball

18:45.834 --> 18:47.794
dressed as the ninth duchess.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.922
You see, she was a Cavendish,

18:51.089 --> 18:52.757
so we knew all about her
at Chatsworth.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.096
Her marriage was miserable,
and she took a lover.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.765
When the duke found out,
he divorced her

19:00.932 --> 19:02.976
and took her children away.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.394
And she took her own life.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.732
I thought you should know,
Sophie.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.698
I think your husband intends
to humiliate you.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.834
Oh.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.128
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb
you, Your-Your Majesty.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.384
When I first came
to the throne...

19:39.345 --> 19:42.348
they used to call me
a little girl.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.523
And now...

19:50.690 --> 19:51.858
now they will call me a...

19:52.025 --> 19:54.652
what will they call me?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.696
A nursemaid.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.826
No queen has ever had a baby
whilst on the throne.

20:04.537 --> 20:09.125
I've had seven.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.877
Seven.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.380
No.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.928
No, they...

20:20.094 --> 20:21.805
they are laughing at me.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.561
I can hear them.

20:28.728 --> 20:33.399
I don't know who "they" are,
ma'am,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.068
but what I see,

20:35.235 --> 20:38.196
and I'm sure
I'm not the only one,

20:38.363 --> 20:40.573
is a mother
who loves her children.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.453
And I am glad
that woman is my queen.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.210
<i>S'?</i>

20:52.377 --> 20:56.005
The skull is
the landscape of character.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.715
Fascinating.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.301
Really is such a good suggestion
of yours,

21:00.468 --> 21:02.762
Feodora.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.305
Bertie, come on up here

21:04.472 --> 21:05.640
so that, uh,

21:05.807 --> 21:07.100
Mr. Coombe may examine you.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.937
Bertie, behave yourself.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.481
Otherwise I will send your mouse

21:13.648 --> 21:15.817
to the taxidermist. The what?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.041
The prince's anterior lobe,

21:32.208 --> 21:35.753
the seat of the intellect,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.631
is sadly underdeveloped,

21:38.798 --> 21:40.550
while the lobes of
combativeness,

21:40.717 --> 21:44.220
destructiveness and self-esteem,

21:44.387 --> 21:45.388
are most prominent.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.436
Where do you think this...
weakness

21:51.603 --> 21:53.479
might come from?

21:53.646 --> 21:54.439
Your grandfather, ma'am.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.483
Late King George,

21:57.650 --> 22:02.739
I believe had
the same feebleness of mind.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.866
Bertie may be willful

22:05.033 --> 22:07.243
and slow with his lessons,

22:07.410 --> 22:09.537
but he is not mad.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.915
Do you think there is any hope
of improvement?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.750
Oh, the cranium never lies, sir.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.210
He cannot help his temper,

22:16.377 --> 22:17.629
it's all part of his character.

22:17.795 --> 22:18.963
Hmm!

22:19.130 --> 22:20.590
Bertie, apologize to Mr. Coombe

22:20.757 --> 22:21.507
for your carelessness. Uh-uh.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.217
Bertie, do as I say!

22:23.384 --> 22:25.136
I won't, and you can't make me.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.303
You don't want that
horrible Mr. Cain to come back.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.016
Do You? Sorry!

22:30.183 --> 22:31.976
Oh, Bertie come back.

22:32.143 --> 22:36.189
Come back, Bertie.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.458
So what are we supposed to do,
hmm?

22:37.482 --> 22:39.776
Put him in a straightjacket?

22:39.943 --> 22:42.820
Victoria, why do you
always have to exaggerate?

22:42.987 --> 22:45.657
Bertie was fine,
until Feodora arrived.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.201
That is beneath you.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.411
Feodora has done nothing butgood

22:50.578 --> 22:52.538
for this family.
Has she? Has she indeed?

22:53.998 --> 22:55.291
Perhaps you should ask her

22:55.458 --> 22:56.769
if she knows anything
about the etchings.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.419
What is that supposed to mean?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.338
Lord Alfred said she had a new horse.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.756
I didn't buy it for her.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.424
You think she would betray you

23:03.591 --> 23:05.093
for a horse?

23:05.259 --> 23:06.803
Victoria, please,

23:06.970 --> 23:08.429
exercise a little reason.

23:08.596 --> 23:09.990
Feodora is your sister,
she's not your enemy.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.725
No, Albert, I don't need
a lobe of logic

23:12.892 --> 23:16.062
to understand that Feodora can
be a sister and an enemy.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.189
Hmm.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.028
<i>S'?</i>

23:32.120 --> 23:34.831
Oh, I am sorry
to disappoint you, Duke.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.625
I imagine you were looking
forward

23:37.792 --> 23:39.912
to watching me arrive at the
palace dressed as a woman

23:40.003 --> 23:42.630
whose life was destroyed
by her husband.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.174
Oh, I think you'll find

23:45.341 --> 23:47.260
she was the author
of her own misfortunes.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.179
Really?

23:50.346 --> 23:52.306
Well, I would rather go dressed
as my grandmother,

23:52.432 --> 23:55.059
who was a servant,

23:55.226 --> 23:56.394
than a member of your family.

23:59.897 --> 24:03.776
<i>S'?</i>

24:12.618 --> 24:15.163
Why has everyone got white hair?

24:15.329 --> 24:17.707
Because it's what they
wore in the Georgian times.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.209
What's a Georgian time?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.211
It's when all the kings were
called George.

24:22.378 --> 24:26.799
So when I'm king,
it will be a Bertian time.

24:26.966 --> 24:31.012
Vicky, Bertie, come here.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.699
Bertie, what have you got
on your head?

24:32.764 --> 24:34.491
We're trying to make his head
the right shape,

24:34.515 --> 24:35.795
so he can be a proper king,
Mama.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.604
Papa won't love me
if I have a naughty bump.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.944
<i>S'?</i>

25:00.917 --> 25:05.338
The whole point of phrenology is
that it is not his fault,

25:05.505 --> 25:06.690
it is just
the way that he is made.

25:06.714 --> 25:07.941
Bertie doesn't understand that,

25:07.965 --> 25:09.092
and, frankly, neither do I.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.886
I think all
of your precious phrenology

25:12.053 --> 25:14.305
is just mumbo-jumbo!

25:20.937 --> 25:22.257
Oh, these costumes are
ridiculous.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.689
Oh, of course.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.859
Now that Mr. Coombe has made
the connection

25:27.026 --> 25:30.113
between your grandfather
King George and Bertie,

25:30.279 --> 25:31.548
I suppose wearing costumes
from his reign

25:31.572 --> 25:33.616
is rather... unfortunate.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.868
There is no connection.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.370
Mr. Coombe is a charlatan.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.312
That's a magnificent tiara
you're wearing.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.796
Thank you.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.882
Those sapphires must have been
very expensive.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.609
I had no idea Langenburg was
so wealthy,

25:51.759 --> 25:54.428
but perhaps you've come
into money lately.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.515
<i>Guten abend.</i>

25:57.682 --> 25:58.682
Oh, Frederick the Great.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.477
Awarrior and a philosopher.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.145
What could be more appropriate?

26:03.312 --> 26:06.566
What a happy Coburg trio, I...

26:06.732 --> 26:08.109
I mean...

26:08.276 --> 26:11.112
quartet, we make.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.575
<i>S'?</i>

26:25.376 --> 26:28.337
Her Majesty the Queen.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.885
His Royal Highness.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.012
Prince Albert.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.930
His Majesty

26:38.097 --> 26:39.640
the King of the Belgians.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.893
Her Serene Highness

26:42.059 --> 26:44.061
the Princess Feodora.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.332
Joseph, what are you doing?

28:28.499 --> 28:29.643
Just delivering a message
to the...

28:29.667 --> 28:31.502
Stop mooning about

28:31.669 --> 28:33.379
like a lovesick plow boy
and do your job.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.715
At once, Mr. Penge. Now, boy!

28:37.591 --> 28:39.135
Why don't you give him a taste

28:39.301 --> 28:41.429
of his own medicine?

28:41.595 --> 28:44.598
He would love a chance
to dismiss me.

28:44.765 --> 28:49.020
But when I go,
it will be my doing.

28:49.186 --> 28:53.607
I am not going to stay wearing
this forever.

29:08.873 --> 29:12.543
Do you like my costume, Joseph?

29:12.710 --> 29:15.880
Very much, Your Grace.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.924
Oh, I am not a duchess tonight.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.343
No? No.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.722
Though, uh...

29:24.889 --> 29:27.349
this bodice is
rather constricting.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.483
Perhaps I may be of assistance?

29:35.649 --> 29:38.235
Yes, Joseph, I believe you can.

29:58.589 --> 30:03.552
Your beauty spot is rather
begumng.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.930
I will wait for you, Lady I.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.973
Arranging an assignation?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.601
Just pursuing my interests,
Serene Highness.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.353
You really should be
more careful,

30:12.520 --> 30:16.315
you know how the prince feels
about such pursuits.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.026
Well, the prince is a prude.

30:19.193 --> 30:22.822
And my activities have nothing
to do with politics.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.282
And besides,

30:25.449 --> 30:27.243
the queen and I rub along
rather well.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.453
Really?

30:29.620 --> 30:33.374
I imagine that endears
you even further to the prince.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.043
Well, well,

30:36.210 --> 30:40.381
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson do seems
to be enjoying themselves.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.343
Of course,
they've been rather shunned

30:44.510 --> 30:46.679
since the scandal.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.974
I do hope they were
sufficiently grateful

30:50.141 --> 30:51.350
for their invitation.

30:51.517 --> 30:56.480
Oh, I have no complaints.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.774
I think you should ask me
to dance,

30:58.941 --> 31:02.278
Lord Palmerston.
A pleasure, madam.

31:16.250 --> 31:20.337
Where exactly do you require
my assistance,

31:20.504 --> 31:23.966
Your Grace?

31:24.133 --> 31:25.217
Just here,

31:25.384 --> 31:26.218
Joseph.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.763
Here... or here?

31:47.489 --> 31:51.785
Oh, we, we shouldn't.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.997
Do you want me to stop,
Your Grace?

31:55.164 --> 31:56.164
No.

31:56.207 --> 31:57.333
No.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.846
How are you enjoying the ball,
Duke?

32:11.013 --> 32:13.849
As much as can be expected.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.976
Have you seen my wife?

32:16.143 --> 32:17.937
Or Lord Palmerston?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.939
Not lately.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.024
Perhaps they're having supper.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.901
Hmm.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.531
How well you look, Feodora.

32:29.698 --> 32:33.535
I must confess I almost did not
recognize you earlier.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.954
That's hardly surprising,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.206
we haven't seen each other
for 20 years.

32:37.373 --> 32:40.000
Since you made me leave England
to get married.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.587
You had no dowry to speak of,
but your mother and I,

32:43.754 --> 32:45.965
we did the best we could.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.842
You did the best for Victoria,
not for me.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.970
Naturally, she was the heir
to the throne.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.807
And I was an... inconvenience.

32:54.974 --> 32:58.602
It was so long ago.

32:58.769 --> 32:59.937
Not for me.

33:17.788 --> 33:20.374
Where has that hobbledehoy
Joseph disappeared to?

33:24.545 --> 33:26.171
You see that couple?

33:26.338 --> 33:27.631
It would be hard to miss them,

33:27.798 --> 33:28.882
ma'am.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.134
Who are they?

33:30.301 --> 33:31.927
Why do they keep looking
at me like that?

33:32.094 --> 33:35.597
George Hudson, ma'am.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.144
The swindler?

33:46.191 --> 33:50.279
This is madness.

33:50.446 --> 33:51.822
Not from where I stand.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.952
I must go back.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.902
The Duke.

35:12.069 --> 35:13.320
Before you go.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.905
Where the blazes have you been?!

35:27.960 --> 35:31.839
Answering a call of nature, sir.

36:06.457 --> 36:08.000
Victoria, do you not think

36:08.167 --> 36:10.169
that Feodora has done such

36:10.335 --> 36:12.629
a marvelous job
of organizing the ball?

36:12.796 --> 36:15.966
Oh, well, her ingenuity,

36:16.133 --> 36:17.819
especially when it comes
to the invitations,

36:17.843 --> 36:19.845
is unparalleled.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.930
What on earth do you mean?

36:22.097 --> 36:25.350
These, these,
these are your guests.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.395
Well, they have been invited
in my name, certainly.

36:28.562 --> 36:29.962
But without my knowledge
or consent.

36:31.607 --> 36:32.900
Who, for example,

36:33.066 --> 36:35.611
is that peculiar-looking
gentleman over there?

36:35.777 --> 36:37.217
The one actually taking off
his coat?

36:37.362 --> 36:39.740
Why is he here?

36:42.242 --> 36:45.245
I invited him.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.663
His name is Elkington,

36:46.830 --> 36:48.957
and he is a celebrated inventor.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.043
I would thank you
for pointing him out,

36:51.210 --> 36:53.420
I must talk with him.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.047
Well, he may be your friend,
Albert,

36:55.214 --> 36:56.524
but what about that couple
over there?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.510
The swindler
and his overdressed wife.

37:02.513 --> 37:05.057
Perhaps you will tell me
why the Hudsons are here.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.934
The Hudsons?

37:08.685 --> 37:10.479
You can't expect me to remember

37:10.646 --> 37:12.606
all the names on the list.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.236
Then I will ask them myself.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.779
No, I...

37:18.946 --> 37:21.990
I believe that would be beneath
your dignity, Drina.

37:22.157 --> 37:25.577
The behavior
of, of a washerwoman,

37:25.744 --> 37:28.997
not a queen.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.178
So this is your reward.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.145
Oh, well, at least
you didn't sell them cheap.

37:46.557 --> 37:48.934
Feo, you have made me look
ridiculous.

37:49.101 --> 37:52.729
Oh, I think that it is
all your own doing, Drina.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.857
You hate me.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.651
You hate me, don't you?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.115
Nothing has been right, Feo.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.701
Nothing has been right
since you came here!

38:07.995 --> 38:09.395
I know you would like
nothing better

38:09.538 --> 38:10.778
than to turn Albert against me.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.165
I don't understand why.

38:14.001 --> 38:17.087
I have always done my best
for you.

38:17.254 --> 38:18.630
Your best for me?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.216
Do you know

38:21.383 --> 38:24.011
the last time I remember
being happy?

38:27.431 --> 38:30.934
It was when we lived
at Kensington,

38:31.101 --> 38:33.895
and the old king asked me here
to the palace.

38:34.062 --> 38:39.234
I played Bach,

38:39.401 --> 38:42.279
and he told me I had
the prettiest profile

38:42.446 --> 38:44.656
he had ever seen.

38:44.823 --> 38:49.369
And he was going to ask Mama
for my hand.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.247
Oh, Feo.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.208
You? Marry that fat old man!

38:55.375 --> 38:56.668
He could barely stand up.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.755
But I would have been queen.

39:03.759 --> 39:07.888
That was not Mama's plan.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.891
Or Leopold's, no.

39:11.058 --> 39:16.647
They wanted you to be queen,
not me.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.441
So they sent me away,

39:19.608 --> 39:21.693
marry the first man
who would have me.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.990
That wasn't my fault.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.080
You don't know what it's like

39:33.246 --> 39:37.626
to live under a roof that leaks,

39:37.793 --> 39:40.212
or to lie next to a man

39:40.379 --> 39:45.509
who has drunk himself
into a stupor.

39:45.676 --> 39:48.720
You have everything, Drina,

39:48.887 --> 39:50.847
and you don't even know
how lucky you are!

39:57.062 --> 39:58.647
<i>S'?</i>

39:58.814 --> 40:00.814
A little piece of the
palace in your very own home.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.217
Look at that,
do you like that one?

40:02.275 --> 40:05.487
How much? Ashilling to you, sir.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.447
Thank you very much indeed.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.074
Hello, there, now then.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.202
How many scenes of the
royal household you can own?

40:12.369 --> 40:13.537
How much is that one?

40:13.704 --> 40:14.830
It is a shilling. Thank you.

40:14.996 --> 40:18.166
Oh, thank you very much.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.714
Bertie.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.841
Sehr <i>gut.</i>

40:26.007 --> 40:30.762
Lwill attempt...

40:30.929 --> 40:32.097
<i>Touché.</i>

40:33.890 --> 40:35.350
Ha ha! No, Bertie!

40:35.517 --> 40:36.661
I've got the queen.
Give it back.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.311
No. ALBERT: Ah.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.747
No, no, no,
give that back to me, Bertie.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.022
Rotter.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.816
That was a very
foolish thing to do.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.401
But you're always playing

40:44.568 --> 40:46.194
with Vicky,
and you never play with me.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.905
That's because your head
hasn't got a chess bump.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.991
Ah, no, no, no.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.245
Now, shall we play
with your marbles, Bertie, hmm?

40:55.412 --> 40:57.289
I don't want to play
with my marbles.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.958
I want to play chess!

41:03.086 --> 41:05.130
Bertie!

41:05.297 --> 41:07.758
Leave me alone!

41:07.924 --> 41:09.404
You could play chess
with him, Albert.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.344
No, no, it is clear.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.889
He shall never be able to learn
the rules.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.976
Lam saving him
from further disappointment.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.438
So you are just going
to give up on him?

41:21.605 --> 41:24.524
No, no, no,
I am being pragmatic.

41:24.691 --> 41:25.960
You heard
what Mr. Coombe had to say.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.070
Do you think Mr. Coombe knows
yourson

41:29.237 --> 41:31.406
better than you do?

41:31.573 --> 41:33.408
<i>"Dei Gratia,".</i>

41:33.575 --> 41:35.702
"By the grace of God."

41:37.662 --> 41:38.955
It's on every coin.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.916
Every coin, Prime Minister,
except this one.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.920
I hear they're calling it
the godless florin.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.589
First the etchings,

41:47.756 --> 41:49.466
- and now this.
- Rest assured, ma'am,

41:49.633 --> 41:52.427
we will make sure
that this error is corrected.

41:52.594 --> 41:54.197
Corrected, it's too late.
The damage has been done.

41:54.221 --> 41:55.889
May I speak frankly, ma'am?

41:56.056 --> 41:58.016
You don't usually ask
my permission

41:58.183 --> 42:00.393
before telling me something
I don't want to hear.

42:02.312 --> 42:03.956
I think these pictures have done
you the power of good.

42:03.980 --> 42:04.980
Oh, what on earth

42:05.106 --> 42:06.274
do you mean?

42:06.441 --> 42:08.568
This cost me a shilling.

42:10.737 --> 42:14.241
Do you think
the people are buying these

42:14.407 --> 42:17.452
in order to laugh at them?

42:17.619 --> 42:22.165
Every time you have a child,
the nation rejoices, ma'am,

42:22.332 --> 42:25.460
but they also wonder
how much your burgeoning family

42:25.627 --> 42:26.670
is going to cost them.

42:26.837 --> 42:28.213
You did say I could speak
frankly.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.173
These etchings,

42:30.340 --> 42:32.092
these trivial domestic scenes,

42:32.259 --> 42:34.010
they remind your subjects

42:34.177 --> 42:37.097
that you are not some remote,
Olympian being,

42:37.264 --> 42:39.307
but rather a woman
who bathes her children

42:39.474 --> 42:41.184
and loves her dogs.

42:41.351 --> 42:43.061
And that's...

42:43.228 --> 42:46.022
desirable?

42:47.941 --> 42:49.776
Do you want me
to tell you the secret

42:49.943 --> 42:51.194
to my popularity, ma'am?

42:51.361 --> 42:53.238
I am a viscount,
but when the people see me

42:53.405 --> 42:55.198
at the races,
or at a prize fight,

42:55.365 --> 42:58.326
they just see a fellow
who likes a flutter...

42:59.536 --> 43:01.538
just as they do.

43:01.705 --> 43:04.416
And you don't think that
familiarity breeds contempt?

43:04.583 --> 43:07.460
Is this familiar

43:07.627 --> 43:09.796
to your subjects, ma'am?

43:11.756 --> 43:15.886
But a baby and a dog,

43:16.052 --> 43:18.221
that they understand.

43:22.809 --> 43:23.977
You may be right.

43:27.439 --> 43:30.108
But the coin,
the coin is unforgivable.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.110
Who is responsible?

43:36.448 --> 43:38.825
I'm asking you,
Prime Minister, who is responsible?

43:38.992 --> 43:41.202
If you remember, ma'am,

43:41.369 --> 43:44.915
the prince took responsibility

43:45.081 --> 43:47.500
for the design of the florin.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.836
It would be most unfortunate

43:50.003 --> 43:52.631
were his involvement
to become known,

43:52.797 --> 43:56.176
especially now he is suing
the printer of the etchings.

43:56.343 --> 43:57.427
Perhaps we should

43:57.594 --> 43:58.887
leave Her Majesty

43:59.054 --> 44:02.432
to prepare for the christening.

44:05.852 --> 44:06.853
Will that be all, ma'am?

44:07.020 --> 44:13.485
<i>S'?</i>

44:25.747 --> 44:29.584
<i>S'?</i>

44:29.751 --> 44:32.032
When were you going to tell me
you were suing for damages?

44:32.170 --> 44:35.298
I understood that you
were not able to take action,

44:35.465 --> 44:36.716
so I spoke with the lawyers,

44:36.883 --> 44:39.010
who made it clear there
was nothing preventing me

44:39.177 --> 44:40.512
from doing so.

44:40.679 --> 44:42.555
And you didn't think to ask me
first?

44:42.722 --> 44:46.101
I assumed we wanted
the same thing, Victoria.

44:46.267 --> 44:47.936
Actually, I have changed
my mind.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.741
Lord Pam says
the pictures are very popular.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.655
When did you start wanting
the monarchy

44:58.822 --> 45:00.365
to be nothing more than
entertainment?

45:02.200 --> 45:04.953
The issue is not whether
you are liked, Victoria,

45:05.120 --> 45:06.400
it is whether you are respected.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.876
Look at that.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.354
Where is the inscription
that says

45:13.378 --> 45:14.772
I am queen
through the grace of God?

45:14.796 --> 45:17.132
You could not fit it on,
because of the crown.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.425
You wanted the crown.

45:18.591 --> 45:21.136
Because I wanted to look
like a queen,

45:21.302 --> 45:22.905
but how can I do that when my
own husband doesn't think

45:22.929 --> 45:24.407
the fact that I have been
anointed by God...

45:24.431 --> 45:26.975
Do you not see that
you are contradicting yourself?

45:27.142 --> 45:29.537
The etchings they lower you down
to the level of your people,

45:29.561 --> 45:31.688
but you are furious because
a Latin tag,

45:31.855 --> 45:33.708
that most of your people
cannot even understand,

45:33.732 --> 45:34.892
has been omitted from a coin.

45:35.025 --> 45:36.901
You have no logic!

45:44.868 --> 45:46.828
Oh, um...

45:46.995 --> 45:48.014
Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,

45:48.038 --> 45:48.872
the archbishop is on his way

45:49.039 --> 45:53.043
to the throne room.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.335
For the christening.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.725
<i>S'?</i>

46:12.270 --> 46:14.355
How splendid you look, my dear.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.484
You are coming
to the christening?

46:17.650 --> 46:19.027
Of course.

46:22.906 --> 46:24.866
I know that I will find it
fascinating.

46:46.054 --> 46:49.516
Arthur William Patrick Albert.

46:49.682 --> 46:52.060
I baptize thee
in the name of the Father,

46:52.227 --> 46:55.396
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

46:55.563 --> 46:57.440
We receive this child

46:57.607 --> 46:59.818
into the congregation

46:59.984 --> 47:01.486
of Christ's flock.

47:01.653 --> 47:03.613
The Lord bless you and keep you

47:03.780 --> 47:06.199
the Lord make His face
to shine upon you

47:06.366 --> 47:09.661
and be gracious to you.

47:09.828 --> 47:12.288
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon you

47:12.455 --> 47:14.499
and give you peace. Amen.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.126
Bertie!

47:39.941 --> 47:42.152
Vicky, look!

47:42.318 --> 47:43.862
Children.

47:59.252 --> 48:00.753
Did you really send her away

48:00.920 --> 48:03.298
so she wouldn't marry
Uncle George?

48:03.464 --> 48:06.259
My late father-in-law
liked nothing better

48:06.426 --> 48:08.636
than to torment his brothers

48:08.803 --> 48:13.850
with the notion that
he could still produce an heir.

48:14.017 --> 48:16.519
I'm afraid Feodora was

48:16.686 --> 48:20.398
just a pawn in that game.

48:20.565 --> 48:21.774
You know, she blames me.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.071
She wants to have her revenge.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.323
Revenge?

48:28.489 --> 48:30.241
Oh, you exaggerate, Victoria.

48:30.408 --> 48:34.454
What could a penniless
German princess possibly do

48:34.621 --> 48:36.789
to hurt the Queen of England?

48:39.334 --> 48:41.669
It is true. No.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.634
I never thought of that.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.344
You know my sister

48:49.510 --> 48:51.304
was selling invitations
to the ball?

48:54.807 --> 48:58.937
Well,
I asked her to invite a variety of guests.

48:59.103 --> 49:00.688
If they sent her gifts,

49:00.855 --> 49:03.066
that can only be expected.

49:03.233 --> 49:05.151
People send you things
all the time.

49:05.318 --> 49:06.861
Mmm.

49:10.698 --> 49:15.411
Why do you begrudge her
the crumbs from your table?

49:30.260 --> 49:33.388
I think it's time you went home.

49:33.554 --> 49:37.475
Well, I think your husband would
be sorry to see me go.

49:39.060 --> 49:44.524
He so enjoys having someone
rational to talk to.

49:48.695 --> 49:52.073
She hates me, Albert.
Is it because

49:52.240 --> 49:54.093
she treats you as a sister
and not as a goddess?

49:54.117 --> 49:55.576
Oh... I...

49:55.743 --> 49:56.743
Victoria, I think

49:56.828 --> 49:58.246
your intellect is overtaxed.

50:00.415 --> 50:02.750
You're saying I'm mad?

50:02.917 --> 50:04.228
Is that it, Albert?
Is that what you're saying?

50:04.252 --> 50:05.712
No. No. No. I'm saying,
like Bertie,

50:05.878 --> 50:07.189
I think your character's been
overdeveloped

50:07.213 --> 50:08.798
in the area of self-esteem.

50:13.845 --> 50:15.096
That's enough.

50:17.348 --> 50:18.933
No, I have expected you
to be something

50:19.100 --> 50:20.184
that clearly you cannot be,

50:20.351 --> 50:23.146
Victoria, a rational woman.

50:23.313 --> 50:25.606
But now I, I realize my mistake.

50:30.403 --> 50:32.196
How can you be so cold?

50:34.365 --> 50:37.160
It is the only way that
I can deal with your temper.

50:37.327 --> 50:39.662
I have no desire to descend
to your level.

50:39.829 --> 50:42.081
My level!

51:14.155 --> 51:17.075
When did you stop loving me,
Albert?

51:19.660 --> 51:20.860
I do love you, of course I do,

51:20.953 --> 51:23.373
just as I love the children.

51:25.083 --> 51:28.503
My duty to protect
and care for you all.

51:34.801 --> 51:37.011
That's not what I meant.

51:42.183 --> 51:43.309
I know.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.403
But it is all I have left.

51:53.569 --> 51:59.575
<i>S'?</i>

52:23.474 --> 52:27.103
<i>S'?</i>

52:52.295 --> 52:55.756
My mouse has run away,
and he's never coming back.

52:58.009 --> 52:59.510
Oh, darling, come here.

53:04.098 --> 53:05.808
Come here.

53:05.975 --> 53:08.019
We will get you another mouse.

53:08.186 --> 53:09.479
But it won't be the same.

53:13.357 --> 53:16.527
No, it won't be the same.

53:16.694 --> 53:20.406
Papa doesn't love me anymore,

53:20.573 --> 53:24.035
'cause I'm stupid.

53:28.998 --> 53:32.877
You can't stop
loving someone, Bertie.

53:36.422 --> 53:39.300
It is not possible.

53:39.467 --> 53:42.595
<i>S'?</i>

53:53.356 --> 54:00.196
J " Gloriana J".

54:07.328 --> 54:14.001
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J"
