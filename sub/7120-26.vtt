Man, I still can't believe
marceline is 1,000 years

00:17.199 --> 00:19.599
old and has never seen
"heat signature."

00:19.699 --> 00:22.465
This movie is gonna
blow their minds!

00:22.533 --> 00:24.532
Marceline!

00:24.600 --> 00:27.599
We've brought "heat signature"!
Woot-woot!

00:27.666 --> 00:30.366
Whoo! Hey, so I want you all to

00:30.434 --> 00:33.600
<i>meet Finn and Jake. They
aren't completely lame.</i>

00:33.667 --> 00:36.366
What up? Guys, this is Wendy...

00:36.467 --> 00:38.167
Hey. Boo boo...

00:38.235 --> 00:39.666
Hello. Hello.

00:39.734 --> 00:41.434
And georgy. Hey.

00:41.535 --> 00:43.901
We used to be in a gang together
back in the underworld.

00:43.968 --> 00:45.667
Hmm! Yeah, that's pretty sweet.

00:45.735 --> 00:48.667
Hope y'all like getting your
minds blown, 'cause it's

00:48.735 --> 00:50.268
showtime!

00:50.336 --> 00:52.568
Ugh! What is wrong
with this couch?!

00:52.636 --> 00:54.968
Man, that made my teeth hurt!

00:55.069 --> 00:57.835
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I didn't
really ever sit on

00:57.903 --> 00:59.635
there. I just float usually.

00:59.703 --> 01:02.469
- We kind of all do.
- Ohh, what?!

01:02.537 --> 01:05.102
Man, no fair! Yeah,
well, too bad you're

01:05.170 --> 01:07.102
not vampires. So, anyways, I...

01:07.170 --> 01:10.203
Wait! Hold on just a second.

01:12.637 --> 01:15.270
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Marceline, we insist

01:15.338 --> 01:18.237
you turn us into vampires.
Or ghosts, or whatever... we

01:18.304 --> 01:21.071
just want to fly. All
right, all right. Fine.

01:21.138 --> 01:23.304
Yes! Come on, marceline!

01:23.372 --> 01:25.438
You're gonna turn
these goofballs?

01:25.505 --> 01:27.371
Don't worry.

01:27.439 --> 01:30.072
I've got something way
more fun in mind.

01:32.039 --> 01:34.305
Okay, marceline.

01:34.373 --> 01:37.972
We're ready now. Okay.
Hold that thought.

01:38.073 --> 01:40.739
I'm gonna perform the biting

01:40.807 --> 01:42.973
ritual. You guys,
close your eyes, and

01:43.040 --> 01:47.039
don't open them until I say so.
If you do, your heads will

01:47.107 --> 01:50.873
explode! Okay, Finn. You first.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.873
- Bite!

01:57.941 --> 01:59.941
Chomp!

02:00.009 --> 02:03.608
Boop, boop.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.741
Boop, boop. Okeydokey. All done.

02:06.809 --> 02:11.609
- How do you guys feel?
- Pretty much...

02:11.676 --> 02:15.109
- The same.
- My neck sort of hurts.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.775
Don't you feel a
little hungry...

02:17.843 --> 02:21.443
- For blood?

02:21.510 --> 02:24.977
I... I felt it! Jake,
do you feel it?

02:25.044 --> 02:27.344
Yeah, I could go for some blood.

02:27.411 --> 02:29.043
Oh, no!

02:29.144 --> 02:32.711
Jake, we're gonna have to drink
blood now for all eternity!

02:32.778 --> 02:34.544
Yeah!

02:34.645 --> 02:37.944
What if we turn evil?!
I'll have to start wearing

02:38.012 --> 02:39.777
cologne! Relax, guys.

02:39.845 --> 02:42.678
You can satisfy your
bloodlust without killing.

02:42.779 --> 02:44.878
Look.

02:44.946 --> 02:48.012
You just eat the color.
Here, Jake. You try.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.346
- Ahh!
- Aah! Come on!

02:50.413 --> 02:54.379
Sorry, bro.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.046
Oh, snap! I feel... Stronger.

02:58.147 --> 03:00.746
Whoa.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.914
Marceline, can we float now?
Mm, not yet.

03:03.982 --> 03:07.647
That's a really advanced power.
First, you got to go through

03:07.715 --> 03:11.947
vampire orientation.

03:12.048 --> 03:13.648
Think you chumps can handle it?

03:13.716 --> 03:15.548
♪ Oh, baby! ♪

03:15.616 --> 03:17.548
♪ Yeah, baby! ♪
♪ Baby, baby, baby, yeah! ♪

03:17.616 --> 03:20.548
♪ Baby, yeah, yeah! ♪

03:20.616 --> 03:23.215
Okay, guys. The first
phase of vampire

03:23.283 --> 03:25.649
orientation is learning...

03:25.717 --> 03:27.816
Invisibility!

03:27.883 --> 03:30.016
Ah, hey!

03:32.651 --> 03:36.350
You ready for the power of...

03:36.417 --> 03:39.850
- Invisibility?
- With all my heart!

03:39.918 --> 03:43.850
Good. Now, spin!

03:46.252 --> 03:51.185
Give it a whirl, Jake!
Now chant, "invisible!

03:51.253 --> 03:55.352
Invisible!" Invisible!
Invisible!

03:55.419 --> 03:58.518
Oof!

03:58.586 --> 04:01.986
Yep. It worked.

04:02.053 --> 04:04.319
- We're invisible!
- Ugh!

04:04.387 --> 04:07.119
<i>- You're invisible!
- Hey, then how come we</i>

04:07.187 --> 04:11.053
can see each other?
Because you guys became

04:11.121 --> 04:14.820
vampires at the same time,
so you're forever linked.

04:14.887 --> 04:19.487
Aw, yeah!

04:19.555 --> 04:22.255
Marceline...

04:22.321 --> 04:26.588
You're friends with
some real morons.

04:26.656 --> 04:29.922
Oh, my God, Melissa. Ever
since Clara stopped eating

04:29.990 --> 04:34.155
meat, her skin looks so good!
I mean, she still looks fat,

04:34.223 --> 04:37.256
but, like, I can't say
that junk to her face.

04:37.323 --> 04:39.623
Wow! Lsp's a hobo!

04:39.724 --> 04:44.090
Let's mess with her. I'm
doing so awesome on my

04:44.191 --> 04:46.689
own. Like, right
now, I found this

04:46.757 --> 04:50.090
- can of beans. Who-o-o-o-o-o-!

04:50.157 --> 04:52.991
Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!

04:53.058 --> 04:55.157
She knows it's us!

04:55.225 --> 04:57.424
She must recognize our voices!

04:57.492 --> 04:59.491
Let's disguise them!

04:59.592 --> 05:04.858
We're in-vee-see-beel! Melissa!
I have to go!

05:04.926 --> 05:07.958
They got into my toilet paper!
Melissa, I have to go!

05:11.326 --> 05:14.093
- Give it back, you guys!
- Whee!

05:14.159 --> 05:16.692
Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!

05:19.427 --> 05:24.693
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

05:24.761 --> 05:28.727
My beans! Aah!

05:30.961 --> 05:36.527
Time to join in on the fun! You guys...
Ruined everything!

05:36.629 --> 05:39.728
- I'm gonna kill you!
- But we're undead.

05:43.962 --> 05:46.195
Geez, we really scared her.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.263
Nice vampire scare, guys.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.996
Thanks. Yeah...

05:52.063 --> 05:54.329
Pretty good, fellas.

05:54.397 --> 05:58.429
Yeah. You guys ready...

05:58.497 --> 06:02.097
For the next vampire lesson?

06:02.164 --> 06:04.230
You know we are! Good!

06:04.331 --> 06:05.897
Ow! Ugh!

06:05.964 --> 06:07.797
W-what's the point
of this lesson?!

06:07.865 --> 06:11.164
- Kick 'em harder!
- Ugh!

06:11.266 --> 06:15.031
Ouch! Ow! Oh, my body! It hurts!

06:15.099 --> 06:18.265
Oof! Okay, everyone.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.665
Stop the toughness lesson!
W-what?

06:20.733 --> 06:23.232
- Finn, Jake, you guys okay?

06:23.333 --> 06:24.666
We're okay.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.899
It's all worth it. See?
They're fine.

06:27.967 --> 06:31.100
When did you go all soft? You
used to like teaching people

06:31.167 --> 06:33.333
about kicks. Hey, guys.

06:33.401 --> 06:36.734
I think you're ready
to learn how to float.

06:36.801 --> 06:39.967
All you have to do is
jump off that ledge.

06:40.035 --> 06:42.301
Cool.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.101
W-wait! There's more
beginner lessons

06:44.168 --> 06:45.767
you need to learn
before floating!

06:45.835 --> 06:49.534
Like, uh, the spooky
vampire walk!

06:49.636 --> 06:54.735
See? Spo-o-o-o-o-o-oky! Whoo!

06:54.802 --> 06:56.636
No, way!

06:56.702 --> 06:59.402
We want to fly!

07:07.471 --> 07:10.203
You guys, stop right now!

07:10.271 --> 07:13.536
Marceline, chill out.
It's going to be okay.

07:13.604 --> 07:17.137
We've got a plan. Now,
get in your flying

07:17.238 --> 07:19.504
positions.

07:19.572 --> 07:23.038
Vampires forever! Whoo!

07:23.106 --> 07:25.238
What are you guys waiting for?

07:25.339 --> 07:27.938
Y-you said you had a plan.
We do.

07:28.006 --> 07:32.772
It's to let them die.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.473
Wee-wha-whoo! - Oh, yeah!

07:38.540 --> 07:40.805
Oof! Whoo!

07:40.873 --> 07:43.806
Awesome!

07:43.874 --> 07:47.806
We did it!

07:47.874 --> 07:50.973
Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Awesome!
Way to go, marceline.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.807
Hey, you guys need to stop
trying to kill my friends!

07:53.875 --> 07:56.274
They got to die someday. Hey!

07:56.341 --> 07:59.907
Let's invite them to our place.
When they show up...

07:59.975 --> 08:04.608
We'll suck their guts out
through their brains!

08:04.676 --> 08:07.808
Did you see us?! Yeah,
you guys were pretty

08:07.876 --> 08:10.242
amazing. Hey, we're
gonna throw a

08:10.310 --> 08:12.442
party... In honor
of your new vampire

08:12.510 --> 08:15.042
skills. Holy snaps!
That's awesome!

08:15.110 --> 08:18.743
They're lying to you guys. They
just want to suck the guts

08:18.810 --> 08:21.943
- out of the top of your head.
- What?!

08:22.011 --> 08:26.577
She's just jealous of you.
We'll see you at midnight at

08:26.678 --> 08:29.543
our place. Guys,
promise me you're not

08:29.611 --> 08:31.944
- going to that party.
- We're not gonna go.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.477
- You're not?
- Nah.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.910
I'm kind of tired from doing
vampire stuff all day.

08:35.977 --> 08:37.977
We're just gonna chill.
Oh. Okay.

08:38.046 --> 08:40.378
Well, we're going back home.

08:40.445 --> 08:47.045
- Peace.
- Number 25 blood drive.

08:47.113 --> 08:49.679
Hey, guys! We're here!

08:49.747 --> 08:53.413
Wow! Look at you guys!
That's awesome!

09:00.848 --> 09:05.080
Um...

09:05.181 --> 09:08.114
Hyah! Georgy, what's wrong?!

09:08.181 --> 09:11.514
- Jake, what's happening?!
- I think they're testing

09:11.582 --> 09:13.948
- our vampire ability!
- Oh, sweet.

09:14.016 --> 09:16.448
Vampire kick! Ugh!

09:16.516 --> 09:18.415
Aw, come on!

09:18.516 --> 09:22.315
Will you knock it off already?
You know you're not even real

09:22.383 --> 09:23.882
- vampires.
- Psh!

09:23.983 --> 09:28.750
Then why am I flying, Wendy? Oh.

09:28.817 --> 09:29.883
Whoa!

09:29.983 --> 09:32.249
Yo, man.

09:32.317 --> 09:35.750
- I think marceline tricked us.
- Yeah.

09:35.817 --> 09:39.384
Vampire kick! Finn, Jake...

09:39.451 --> 09:42.150
I'm so sorry I got you into

09:42.251 --> 09:44.184
this. I should have
never pranked you

09:44.252 --> 09:45.951
- so perfectly.
- It's okay.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.118
You're here now to beat up
those ghosts and save us.

09:49.219 --> 09:52.418
Oh, no, vampires
can't beat ghosts.

09:52.486 --> 09:54.585
It's like a
rock-paper-scissors thing.

09:54.686 --> 09:57.785
- I just came to apologize.
- Aw, man!

09:57.853 --> 10:00.918
I can't believe we're gonna die

10:01.020 --> 10:03.020
just 'cause we wanted to
be comfortable watching

10:03.086 --> 10:04.886
"heat signature."

10:04.954 --> 10:10.687
Uh, did you guys say...
"Heat signature"?

10:10.755 --> 10:13.820
Have you located the enemy's
heat signature, private?

10:13.921 --> 10:16.920
Yes, sir. But I also
noticed something...

10:16.988 --> 10:19.787
Strange, something I-I...
I can't explain.

10:19.855 --> 10:22.588
Well, spit it out, man! I-I...

10:22.656 --> 10:26.755
<i>I can't seem to locate
our heat signature!</i>

10:26.822 --> 10:31.188
- Oh!

10:31.256 --> 10:33.822
This stinkups mega
bam-bam to the j-stop!

10:33.890 --> 10:36.756
Can we just go back to the
brain eating, or whatever?

10:36.823 --> 10:39.889
Mm-hmm, after the movie.
- But can't we just...

10:39.957 --> 10:41.123
Shh! Shut!

10:41.190 --> 10:43.323
<i>Look out, commander!</i>

10:43.424 --> 10:47.157
<i>Aah! My heat signature!</i>
