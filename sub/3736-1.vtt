Craig, honey,
it's time for bed.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.726
Craig, honey, time to get up.

03:14.810 --> 03:18.479
Craig, honey, time to get up.
Craig, honey, time to get up.

03:18.814 --> 03:20.481
- Craig, honey, time to get up.
- Lotte.

03:20.566 --> 03:23.735
I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin
Hatch was out of his cage.

03:23.819 --> 03:25.403
Come on.
Morning, sweetheart.

03:25.487 --> 03:27.113
Morning.

03:27.197 --> 03:28.990
What are you gonna do today, honey?

03:29.074 --> 03:30.908
Working in the workshop.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.243
I was thinking.

03:32.327 --> 03:34.954
Maybe you'd feel better
if you got a job.

03:35.038 --> 03:36.247
We've been over this.

03:36.331 --> 03:40.501
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in
today's wintry economic climate.

03:41.378 --> 03:44.505
I know, honey,
but I thought, you know,

03:45.799 --> 03:49.427
maybe something else until this
puppet thing turns around.

03:49.595 --> 03:51.429
Derek Mantini
doesn't need a day job.

03:51.513 --> 03:55.183
Not everybody can be
Derek Mantini.

03:56.101 --> 03:59.729
I gotta get to the shop.
We have a shipment of kitty litter coming in.

03:59.813 --> 04:02.732
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take a look at Elijah today?

04:02.816 --> 04:04.776
He's not feeling
very good again.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.903
Which one is Elijah again?

04:07.863 --> 04:10.031
- The chimp, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

04:14.745 --> 04:16.536
On the lighter
side of the news,

04:16.622 --> 04:19.791
in Westchester County today
puppeteer Derek Mantini

04:19.875 --> 04:22.835
thrilled onlookers as he
performed The Belle of Amherst

04:22.920 --> 04:25.546
with a 60-foot
Emily Dickinson puppet.

04:27.591 --> 04:29.801
How dreary to be somebody!

04:29.885 --> 04:31.928
How public, like a frog

04:32.262 --> 04:35.306
To tell one's
name the livelong day

04:35.432 --> 04:37.225
Gimmicky bastard.

04:40.479 --> 04:43.397
You don't know lucky you are,
being a monkey.

04:44.399 --> 04:46.025
Because consciousness...

04:47.236 --> 04:49.862
is a terrible curse.

04:49.947 --> 04:53.533
I think, I feel, I suffer.

04:55.911 --> 04:59.872
And all I ask in return is the
opportunity to do my work.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.168
And they won't allow it...

05:06.171 --> 05:08.172
Because I raise issues.

05:17.724 --> 05:20.768
While we enjoy the
pleasures of an uneasy love

05:20.853 --> 05:23.437
and abandon ourselves
to fornication,

05:24.106 --> 05:26.691
we were spared God's severity.

05:26.984 --> 05:28.693
Say no more,
I beg you,

05:28.777 --> 05:30.528
and cease
from complaints like these

05:30.612 --> 05:33.739
which are so far removed
from the true depths of love.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.827
Look, a puppet show!

05:38.829 --> 05:41.581
Okay, honey, just for a minute.
Mommy's waiting.

05:41.665 --> 05:44.208
Even during
the celebration of Mass,

05:44.293 --> 05:46.460
when our prayers
should be pure,

05:46.545 --> 05:48.087
lewd visions
of these pleasures

05:48.171 --> 05:51.924
take such a hold
upon my unhappy soul

05:52.009 --> 05:56.846
that my thoughts are on their very
wantonness instead of my prayers.

06:01.768 --> 06:06.981
Sometimes my thoughts are betrayed
by the movement of my body.

06:07.649 --> 06:11.068
I took my fill of my
wretched pleasures in you

06:11.153 --> 06:14.155
and this was
the sum total of my love.

06:46.021 --> 06:47.688
You motherfucker!

06:55.447 --> 06:57.531
Oh, Craig!

06:58.200 --> 07:00.493
Honey, not again!

07:01.036 --> 07:03.913
Why do you do this
to yourself, honey?

07:04.414 --> 07:06.207
I'm a puppeteer.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.842
Seven and a half, right?

08:39.926 --> 08:41.010
Uh, yeah.

08:41.094 --> 08:43.220
I'll take you through it.

09:01.823 --> 09:03.574
Seven and a half.

09:04.159 --> 09:05.743
Thank you.

09:38.527 --> 09:41.445
Welcome to Lestercorp.
How may we meet your filing needs?

09:41.530 --> 09:44.073
No. Um...
My name's Craig Schwartz.

09:44.157 --> 09:45.783
I have an interview
with Dr. Lester.

09:45.867 --> 09:49.120
Oh. Please have a seat,
Mr. Juarez.

09:49.204 --> 09:50.454
Schwartz.

09:50.539 --> 09:52.331
- Pardon?
- Schwartz.

09:52.749 --> 09:56.669
I... I'm sorry. I have no idea what
you're saying to me right now.

09:57.212 --> 09:58.754
My name is Schwartz.

09:58.839 --> 10:00.548
My name is Warts?

10:09.850 --> 10:11.642
Mr. Juarez?

10:12.978 --> 10:14.562
- Oh. Yes?
- Chest?

10:15.147 --> 10:16.230
I said, "Yes?"

10:16.314 --> 10:18.065
You suggest what?

10:18.358 --> 10:23.028
I'm sorry, I have no time for piddling
suggestions from mumbling job applicants.

10:23.113 --> 10:25.739
Besides,
Dr. Lester will see you now.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.578
Come in, Mr. Juarez.

10:32.038 --> 10:34.957
Actually, my name
is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.252
- Security!
- No, sir, it's...

10:38.336 --> 10:41.172
It's just a little mix-up with your secretary.
My name is Craig Schwartz.

10:41.256 --> 10:42.923
I tried to
explain that to her.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.967
She's not my secretary.

10:45.093 --> 10:47.928
- She's what they call an executive liaison.
- Ah.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.806
And I am not banging her, if
that's what you're implying.

10:50.891 --> 10:54.435
No, sir, not at all.
I think I must have simply misspoke.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.486
Ah. Well, now,

11:05.280 --> 11:09.617
tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
feel you can bring to Lestercorp?

11:10.785 --> 11:13.120
Uh, well, sir,
I'm an excellent filer.

11:13.205 --> 11:16.123
Are you? All right.
Let's see about that.

11:21.922 --> 11:26.175
Tell me, which of these two letters comes first?
This one or this one?

11:29.804 --> 11:32.556
The symbol on the left
is not a letter, sir.

11:32.641 --> 11:34.558
Damn, you're good.

11:34.643 --> 11:37.019
- I was trying to trick you.
- I see.

11:37.103 --> 11:40.189
Well, then,
put these in order.

11:40.982 --> 11:42.483
Yes, sir.

11:47.113 --> 11:49.490
Floris,
get Guinness on the phone.

11:49.574 --> 11:52.576
Yes, sir.
Genghis Khan Capone. Fine.

11:52.661 --> 11:53.786
Damn fine woman, Floris.

11:53.870 --> 11:57.873
I don't know how she puts up with
this speech impediment of mine.

11:59.542 --> 12:02.628
You don't have a speech
impediment, Dr. Lester.

12:02.879 --> 12:05.631
Flattery will get you
everywhere, my boy.

12:06.007 --> 12:09.009
I'm afraid I have to trust
Floris on that one.

12:09.135 --> 12:11.095
You see,
she's got her doctorate

12:11.179 --> 12:14.098
in speech impedimentology
from Case Western.

12:14.349 --> 12:16.725
I apologize if you can't
understand a word I'm saying.

12:16.810 --> 12:19.019
No, I understand perfectly.

12:19.354 --> 12:21.855
Oh, it's very kind of you
to lie.

12:22.065 --> 12:23.816
You see,
I've been very lonely

12:23.900 --> 12:27.695
in my isolated tower
of indecipherable speech.

12:33.785 --> 12:35.536
You got the job.

12:36.204 --> 12:37.454
Any questions?

12:37.539 --> 12:39.164
Well, just one.

12:39.499 --> 12:41.750
Why are these
ceilings so low?

12:41.835 --> 12:43.127
Low overhead, my boy!

12:43.211 --> 12:45.713
We pass the savings
on to you.

12:46.256 --> 12:49.633
But seriously, that'll all
be covered in orientation.

13:19.414 --> 13:22.291
Welcome to the seven and a half
floor of the Mertin Flemmer Building.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.501
As you'll now be spending
your work day here,

13:24.586 --> 13:28.630
it is important that you learn a bit
about the history of this famous floor.

13:28.715 --> 13:30.716
Hello, Don.
Hello, Wendy.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.301
Don, I was wondering,

13:32.385 --> 13:35.554
do you know why our workplace
has such low ceilings?

13:35.638 --> 13:37.473
It's an interesting story.

13:37.557 --> 13:39.600
Many years ago
in the late 1800s,

13:39.684 --> 13:42.394
James Mertin,
an Irish ship captain,

13:42.562 --> 13:46.065
came to this town and decided
to erect an office building.

13:46.149 --> 13:49.735
He called this building the Mertin
Flemmer Building after himself

13:49.819 --> 13:52.946
and someone else, who local
legend has it was named Flemmer.

13:53.073 --> 13:56.492
Well, one day, old Captain Mertin
received an unexpected visitor.

13:56.576 --> 13:57.993
Captain Mertin?

13:58.078 --> 14:00.245
Aye. What want ye,
girl child?

14:00.330 --> 14:04.458
I'm not a child, but rather an adult
lady of miniature proportions.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.920
I see. Well, if it's
charity you're after,

14:08.004 --> 14:10.631
be gone with ye,
you foul demon!

14:10.715 --> 14:12.633
I'm not asking for alms

14:12.717 --> 14:15.803
but, rather, the ear of a
kind man with a noble heart.

14:15.887 --> 14:18.555
Well, speak then,
if you must.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.265
Captain Mertin,
I'm afraid that

14:20.350 --> 14:22.518
the world was not built
with me in mind.

14:22.602 --> 14:25.437
Doorknobs are too high,
chairs are unwieldy

14:25.522 --> 14:28.357
and high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature.

14:28.441 --> 14:32.486
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work that's safe and comfortable?

14:32.570 --> 14:35.155
Thy story has moved me
like no other.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.491
Therefore, I shall make ye...

14:38.118 --> 14:39.868
me wife.

14:39.953 --> 14:42.579
And... And I shall build
a floor for ye

14:42.664 --> 14:46.291
between the seventh and the
eighth in me own building

14:46.668 --> 14:50.129
so at least there'll be
one place on God's green earth

14:50.338 --> 14:53.632
where ye and your accursed
kind can live in peace.

14:55.510 --> 14:58.303
So that's the story
of seven and a half.

14:58.471 --> 15:00.264
Since the rents
are considerably lower,

15:00.348 --> 15:02.599
this floor has been adopted
by businesses which,

15:02.684 --> 15:05.394
for one reason or another, have
been forced to cut corners.

15:05.478 --> 15:08.063
After all,
the overhead is low.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.160
Moving story, huh?

15:22.537 --> 15:25.038
Unfortunately,
the story's bullshit.

15:29.043 --> 15:32.129
Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.
I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.

15:32.213 --> 15:34.381
Where are you starting out?

15:38.887 --> 15:40.971
Shut up! Shut up!

15:41.097 --> 15:42.306
Shut up! Shut up!

15:42.390 --> 15:43.557
Hey, shut up!

15:43.641 --> 15:46.977
- Shut up! I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, honey.

15:47.145 --> 15:50.230
Sorry, honey. Sorry, honey.

15:51.566 --> 15:53.734
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

15:53.818 --> 15:55.319
Help!
She's locking me in a cage.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.404
Isn't that cute?
I just taught him that today.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.323
Yeah, that's adorable.

16:01.784 --> 16:04.745
- You want to do some dishes for me?
- Put that down.

16:04.829 --> 16:07.080
Here, Elijah. Here you go.

16:07.415 --> 16:10.375
You know, I have an appointment
tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.502
Uh-huh.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.295
Yeah. I think we're
finally getting down

16:13.379 --> 16:15.714
to the bottom of this
acid stomach, aren't we?

16:15.798 --> 16:17.341
Come here.

16:20.345 --> 16:21.595
Just get down from the...

16:21.679 --> 16:25.015
She thinks that it's
some sort of childhood trauma.

16:27.393 --> 16:30.854
- Feelings of inadequacy as a
chimp, you know? - Mmm-hmm.

16:31.439 --> 16:33.857
Careful.
Isn't that interesting?

16:33.942 --> 16:35.275
Mmm-hmm.

16:35.735 --> 16:38.028
I find it
really interesting.

16:42.617 --> 16:46.453
So, honey, have you thought any
more about us having a baby?

16:47.956 --> 16:49.373
Uh...

16:50.291 --> 16:52.876
You know, I think it's just so tough
right now, economically and all...

16:52.961 --> 16:54.545
Mmm-hmm.

16:54.629 --> 16:59.132
...that I think maybe we should just
wait and see if this job thing pays off.

17:00.468 --> 17:02.302
- You know?
- Okay.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.019
I was thinking about
what you were saying

17:11.104 --> 17:13.230
about the orientation film
being bullshit.

17:13.314 --> 17:14.481
Yes?

17:15.316 --> 17:16.733
I think maybe
you're on to something.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.027
And 50 other lines
to get into a girl's pants.

17:19.112 --> 17:21.070
No, no!

17:21.155 --> 17:24.907
No, I was just talking about the...
You know, about the film.

17:24.992 --> 17:26.702
Here's the thing.

17:27.619 --> 17:29.413
If you ever got me,

17:30.039 --> 17:33.166
you wouldn't have a clue
what to do with me.

17:36.254 --> 17:39.256
I wasn't...
I was talking about the film.

17:44.596 --> 17:48.807
Ooh, what magic those fingers could
work on the right cabinet, mmm.

17:49.183 --> 17:51.518
Maybe you could
alphabetize me.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.437
And don't forget,

17:53.521 --> 17:56.857
"I" comes before "U."

17:59.152 --> 18:01.612
Floris,
I think you're very nice,

18:02.322 --> 18:06.158
but the truth is that
I'm in love with someone else.

18:06.909 --> 18:10.245
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

18:10.747 --> 18:12.247
You bastard.

18:12.373 --> 18:13.540
What?

18:13.916 --> 18:17.002
- Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
- Oh, no...

18:17.086 --> 18:20.005
If I was 80 years younger,
I'd box your ears.

18:20.089 --> 18:23.133
I wasn't toying with her, sir.
I wouldn't...

18:23.509 --> 18:24.843
Pardon me.
How old are you, sir?

18:24.927 --> 18:26.887
One hundred and five.

18:27.388 --> 18:29.723
Carrot juice, and lots of it.

18:30.183 --> 18:33.477
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.

18:33.936 --> 18:37.898
And I have to piss sitting down
like a goddamn girly-girl,

18:37.982 --> 18:39.691
- every 15 minutes.
- Mmm.

18:39.776 --> 18:41.818
But nobody wants to die.

18:42.445 --> 18:45.364
Ah, to be a young man again,
eh, Schwartz?

18:46.115 --> 18:48.659
Maybe then
Floris would care for me.

18:50.203 --> 18:53.413
But the elderly have so much to offer, sir.
They're our link with history.

18:53.498 --> 18:56.041
I don't wanna be
your goddamn link, damn ya.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.628
I want to feel Florie's
naked thighs next to mine.

19:00.254 --> 19:04.883
I want my body to inspire lust in
that beautiful, complex woman.

19:05.343 --> 19:10.555
I want her to shiver with a spasm of ecstasy,
Schwartz, as I penetrate her wet...

19:10.640 --> 19:14.393
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered you
would share your feelings with me,

19:14.477 --> 19:18.397
perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable
environment for this type of discussion.

19:18.481 --> 19:19.856
All right. You're right.

19:19.941 --> 19:24.695
I'll tell you what. Meet me after work
today at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex

19:24.779 --> 19:27.698
and I'll spill
my goddamn guts for ya.

19:30.451 --> 19:33.453
No, I won't be late, Lotte.
I just have to, you know,

19:33.955 --> 19:36.998
listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a while.

19:37.083 --> 19:39.209
It's a job thing, really.

19:42.213 --> 19:44.423
Yeah. So,
I'll talk to you later, okay?

19:44.507 --> 19:45.882
Yeah. You too.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.593
Gotta go back to work.
Okay, bye.

19:50.513 --> 19:54.641
Hi. Do you know that I don't even
know your name or where you work?

19:54.809 --> 19:56.059
Yeah.

19:58.771 --> 20:00.856
Um, okay, how about this?

20:01.274 --> 20:03.024
If I can guess your name
in three tries,

20:03.109 --> 20:06.194
you have to come
have a drink with me tonight.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.739
Why not?

20:09.198 --> 20:11.450
Okay.

20:11.909 --> 20:13.577
You look like a...

20:17.331 --> 20:18.623
Bar...

20:20.168 --> 20:21.460
Ru...

20:23.588 --> 20:26.298
Bell... Lu...

20:26.674 --> 20:29.134
L... Carol...

20:29.218 --> 20:32.012
Ta... Shar...

20:32.263 --> 20:34.306
Susann...

20:34.807 --> 20:38.518
Emm... ily...

20:38.603 --> 20:41.271
Mar... lar...

20:41.355 --> 20:44.691
Maax... ine...
M-M-M-Maxine?

20:45.026 --> 20:47.235
Yeah!
Who told you?

20:47.528 --> 20:49.988
Nobody told me.
That just came out.

20:50.531 --> 20:52.157
Isn't that odd?

20:53.534 --> 20:55.744
So where do you live
and stuff?

20:56.370 --> 20:59.164
I am dubious,
but I don't welsh.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.709
Okay, meet me
at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.921
If you're late, I walk.

21:06.714 --> 21:08.340
Nubile. Blonde.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.091
Wet with desire.

21:10.176 --> 21:12.761
Me in leather.
A harness, if you like.

21:12.887 --> 21:16.223
And all eyes, Craig,
are upon me as I speak.

21:16.641 --> 21:20.727
"Ladies," I begin.
"I am the love god Eros."

21:21.103 --> 21:22.521
They like that.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.481
"I intoxicate you.

21:24.649 --> 21:27.609
"My spunk is, to you,
manna from heaven."

21:27.735 --> 21:30.862
Dr. Lester, this is all
really fascinating and stuff,

21:30.947 --> 21:33.865
but I gotta
get back home to my wife.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.951
You have a wife.
I'd like to meet her.

21:36.035 --> 21:38.829
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we say dinner Thursday?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.665
You can come, too,
if you like.

21:41.749 --> 21:43.333
Get that? That was a joke.

21:43.417 --> 21:45.126
You hear what I said?
You can come too.

21:45.211 --> 21:46.878
That was a good one.

21:46.963 --> 21:49.297
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:58.558 --> 22:00.600
Maxine. Maxine.

22:00.768 --> 22:02.853
- I made it, Maxine.
- Just.

22:02.979 --> 22:05.146
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

22:05.231 --> 22:06.857
Are you married?

22:08.943 --> 22:10.569
Yeah. But enough about me.

22:10.653 --> 22:11.778
Yeah.

22:13.489 --> 22:14.698
What'll you have?

22:14.782 --> 22:16.700
I'll have more of the same,
please, Barry.

22:16.784 --> 22:19.536
And I'll have, uh,
a light beer or something.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.996
Hi.

22:24.292 --> 22:25.709
So, uh...

22:26.878 --> 22:28.962
I don't know... I, uh...

22:29.630 --> 22:32.215
I like you. I don't know what
it is about you. I just...

22:32.300 --> 22:34.384
- My tits?
- No! No, no, no, no.

22:34.468 --> 22:38.096
- No? - It's your energy, attitude,
the way you carry yourself.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.347
You're not a fag, are you?

22:39.432 --> 22:41.725
No. I am
really attracted to you.

22:41.809 --> 22:44.394
"I am really attracted to you."
Christ, you are a fag.

22:44.478 --> 22:46.563
Well, we can share recipes
if you like, Darlene.

22:46.647 --> 22:49.566
No, wait! I love your tits.
I wanna fuck 'em.

22:49.650 --> 22:51.776
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.237
Not a chance.

22:54.739 --> 22:57.699
So tell me about yourself,
huh?

22:58.200 --> 23:02.162
If you can get your mind out of
the gutter long enough, dog boy.

23:02.455 --> 23:04.623
Well, I'm a puppeteer.

23:04.707 --> 23:06.416
- I... I've been...
- Check.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.381
Hey.

23:14.008 --> 23:15.216
Hey.

23:15.301 --> 23:17.802
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I just...

23:17.970 --> 23:20.597
Lester just wouldn't
let me get away.

23:20.681 --> 23:23.892
Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to
have dinner with him on Thursday

23:23.976 --> 23:26.269
but I can get us out of it,
if you want.

23:26.354 --> 23:28.855
He's like this
insane old lech,

23:28.940 --> 23:33.109
and it's kind of amusing once you get
past how disgusting it actually is.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.779
- Did you eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

23:35.863 --> 23:38.281
I'm sorry I didn't call.
It was just hard to get away.

23:38.366 --> 23:39.783
I was worried.

23:39.867 --> 23:41.284
I'm sorry.

23:43.537 --> 23:44.746
You know...

23:47.124 --> 23:49.209
you wanted me to work.

23:52.546 --> 23:53.797
How was your evening?

23:53.881 --> 23:55.256
Well...

23:56.050 --> 23:58.551
Tom-Tom's puncture wound
is infected.

23:58.636 --> 24:00.095
The ferret?

24:00.554 --> 24:02.263
- The iguana.
- Right.

24:03.557 --> 24:06.935
So I just dressed the wound and
I've just been feeding everyone

24:07.019 --> 24:09.396
and putting everybody to bed.

24:10.564 --> 24:11.648
You want a beer?

24:11.732 --> 24:14.150
No. I think
I'm going to go to bed.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.820
Elijah's gonna
sleep with us tonight.

24:16.904 --> 24:18.488
I don't think
he's feeling very well.

24:18.572 --> 24:20.615
- Okay. Hmm.
- Yeah.

24:22.076 --> 24:26.162
Well, you know what? I'm gonna go
in my workshop for a little while.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.706
But I'll be in
in a little while.

24:27.790 --> 24:29.082
Okay.

25:11.584 --> 25:14.753
Tell me, Craig,
why do you love puppeteering?

25:17.423 --> 25:21.217
Well, Maxine,
I'm not sure exactly.

25:21.302 --> 25:24.804
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.

25:24.972 --> 25:27.098
Being inside another skin,

25:27.516 --> 25:30.435
thinking differently,
moving differently,

25:30.978 --> 25:32.896
feeling differently.

25:33.647 --> 25:35.482
Interesting, Craig.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.818
Would you like
to be inside my skin,

25:39.570 --> 25:42.947
think what I think,
feel what I feel?

25:46.202 --> 25:48.411
More than anything,
Maxine.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.459
It's good in here, Craig.

25:55.002 --> 25:57.837
It's better than
your wildest dreams.

26:26.033 --> 26:28.451
You're not somebody I could
get interested in, Craig.

26:28.536 --> 26:30.328
You play with dolls.

26:30.621 --> 26:35.333
Puppets, Maxine. It's the idea of
being inside someone else's skin

26:35.751 --> 26:39.170
and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.

26:39.505 --> 26:40.713
Yikes!

26:40.798 --> 26:43.216
It's just that, well...
Please let me explain.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.885
I've never
done this before, but...

26:45.970 --> 26:48.138
I feel something for you,

26:48.222 --> 26:50.640
and I've never
felt this way before.

26:50.724 --> 26:53.768
You know, about anybody,
n-not even my wife.

26:54.562 --> 26:56.312
And I just...

26:56.397 --> 26:59.858
I really feel that you and I
belong together, Maxine.

27:00.442 --> 27:01.568
Oh!

27:26.886 --> 27:28.094
Shit.

28:50.803 --> 28:53.471
See you later.
Hello. Mail room.

28:56.809 --> 28:59.310
Yeah. Yeah.
What's the file number?

29:00.604 --> 29:03.564
3-2-3-6-4. Yep.

29:45.232 --> 29:46.399
Oh!

31:02.184 --> 31:05.812
Oh, you know what?
The puppeteer told me he loved me today.

31:06.021 --> 31:09.148
I know, I can't think
of anything more pathetic.

31:10.317 --> 31:11.692
I'm sorry.

31:13.821 --> 31:15.822
Good afternoon, sir.

31:27.167 --> 31:29.001
The Broadhurst Theater,
please.

31:36.593 --> 31:39.846
Hey, say, uh,
ain't you that actor guy?

31:39.930 --> 31:41.347
Yes.

31:41.682 --> 31:45.017
John, uh... What is, uh...
John, um, uh...

31:46.603 --> 31:48.312
Uh, don't tell me.
Maplethorpe?

31:48.397 --> 31:51.858
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich. Right, right. Okay.

31:52.818 --> 31:55.570
Yeah. I thought you were
all right in that one movie.

31:55.654 --> 31:56.946
Thank you.

31:57.030 --> 31:59.449
The one where you played
a jewel thief.

31:59.533 --> 32:01.784
I never played
a jewel thief.

32:01.869 --> 32:04.203
No? Who am I thinkin' of?

32:04.705 --> 32:06.247
I don't know.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.124
Just, uh...

32:09.376 --> 32:13.087
No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.
The, uh... 'Cause, uh...

32:50.167 --> 32:52.710
Yeah. Absolutely, doll.

32:53.712 --> 32:56.130
Yeah.
I'm just about to close up.

32:56.423 --> 33:00.176
Wanna meet at the Pig
in 20 minutes? Cool. Bye.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.138
I'm splitting' for the day,
puppet man.

33:04.223 --> 33:05.223
Lock up for me, okay?

33:05.307 --> 33:07.725
Don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

33:07.809 --> 33:10.144
- No.
- Please, this is important.

33:10.729 --> 33:12.188
Better be.

33:12.272 --> 33:13.606
It is.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.114
There's a tiny door
in my office, Maxine.

33:22.199 --> 33:26.369
It's a portal, and it takes
you inside John Malkovich.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.497
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes

33:29.581 --> 33:32.208
and then after about 15
minutes, you're spit out

33:32.292 --> 33:35.169
into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.

33:35.254 --> 33:38.297
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

33:38.966 --> 33:42.343
Oh, he's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

33:42.427 --> 33:44.512
Oh, yeah?
What's he been in?

33:44.888 --> 33:47.056
Lots of things.
That jewel thief movie, for example.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.309
He's very well respected.
Anyway, the point is

33:50.644 --> 33:55.439
this is a very odd thing.
It's supernatural,

33:55.566 --> 33:58.442
for lack of a better word.
I mean, it raises

33:58.527 --> 34:01.279
all sorts of philosophical-type
questions, you know...

34:01.363 --> 34:04.907
about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

34:04.992 --> 34:07.785
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?

34:09.161 --> 34:12.831
I had a piece of wood in my hand.
I don't have it anymore.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.918
Where is it?
Did it disappear?

34:16.003 --> 34:19.255
How could that be?
Is it still in Malkovich's head?

34:19.672 --> 34:21.257
I don't know!

34:22.342 --> 34:26.846
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?

34:30.851 --> 34:35.478
I don't see how I could go on living
my life the way I've lived it before.

34:52.205 --> 34:53.998
- Yeah?
- So I've been thinking,

34:54.081 --> 34:55.791
is this Malkovich fellow
appealing?

34:55.876 --> 34:59.045
Maxine! Yes, of course,
Maxine. He's a celebrity.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.672
Good. We'll sell tickets.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.258
Tickets to Malkovich?

35:04.343 --> 35:06.802
Exactly. $200 a pop.

35:09.139 --> 35:12.975
But, Maxine, there's something, I
don't know, like profound here.

35:13.060 --> 35:16.437
I don't know if maybe we
should exploit it. You think?

35:16.980 --> 35:20.816
I need you for this, Craigy.
You're my man on the inside.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.401
You need me?

35:22.736 --> 35:24.487
I'm your man?

35:25.739 --> 35:27.281
Sure, whatever.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.868
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

35:31.370 --> 35:32.995
Treats for everyone.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.747
- Maxine?
- Yeah?

35:35.582 --> 35:38.501
We don't know the significance
of this thing.

35:38.585 --> 35:41.087
It might be dangerous
to toy with?

35:41.588 --> 35:44.924
Well,
I'll protect you, doll face.

35:45.842 --> 35:47.093
Bye-bye.

35:51.056 --> 35:52.598
Who was that?

35:53.433 --> 35:57.353
I'm going to be working a lot of
late nights with this partner

35:57.437 --> 35:59.397
because Lestercorp's open
during the day,

35:59.481 --> 36:01.315
so I'll be working
a lot of late nights.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.735
But it's a good thing, 'cause it's gonna
get us out of the hole financially

36:04.820 --> 36:06.112
'cause we're gonna
turn it into a business.

36:06.196 --> 36:09.448
But I don't understand.
There's not...

36:09.658 --> 36:14.036
There's no such thing as a hole, or
a portal, into somebody's brain.

36:14.121 --> 36:18.374
Yes, there is.
A brain, or soul or whatever.

36:18.458 --> 36:21.168
I was inside John Malkovich
lookin' out.

36:22.170 --> 36:23.671
- Really?
- Yep.

36:23.755 --> 36:25.214
I wanna try it.

36:25.298 --> 36:26.340
Pardon me?

36:26.425 --> 36:29.427
I want to be
John Malkovich, tomorrow.

36:29.511 --> 36:31.846
That'd be perfect, 'cause then
I can meet your partner.

36:31.930 --> 36:34.974
The thing is, Lestercorp's
open during the day,

36:35.058 --> 36:39.603
so we can't go during the day.
But if you want to, we can do it right now.

36:39.813 --> 36:41.564
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight.

36:41.648 --> 36:44.150
Right now,
on the way to Lester's.

36:55.454 --> 36:59.457
I'll meet you on the side of the
road by the New Jersey Turnpike.

37:05.046 --> 37:06.505
I'm scared.

37:07.924 --> 37:10.551
You don't have to do this,
you know.

37:12.763 --> 37:16.140
No. No, I... I wanna go.

37:17.142 --> 37:19.435
- You sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

37:39.539 --> 37:41.207
It's wet.

37:43.126 --> 37:44.460
Weird.

37:52.385 --> 37:54.345
That's nice. Oh!

37:55.722 --> 37:58.724
Oh, mmm!

37:59.684 --> 38:01.352
Oh! Mmm.

38:02.312 --> 38:05.397
God. I feel sexy.

38:13.281 --> 38:15.574
Lotte, are you all right?

38:20.413 --> 38:23.374
Craig! Craig, I gotta go back!
No!

38:23.792 --> 38:27.211
- Maybe tomorrow.
- No! I gotta go back now!

38:27.295 --> 38:29.505
We'll talk
about it later.

38:32.384 --> 38:34.927
Being inside
did something to me.

38:35.595 --> 38:37.263
I knew who I was.

38:42.352 --> 38:46.063
It's like everything made sense.
I... I knew who I was.

38:46.147 --> 38:48.858
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.

38:48.942 --> 38:52.027
God, I was.
I was, wasn't I?

38:54.281 --> 38:55.447
I was...

38:55.532 --> 38:58.450
I was John Malkovich.

39:00.954 --> 39:04.081
I was... I was
John fucking Malkovich!

39:07.961 --> 39:09.128
Take me back, Craig.

39:09.212 --> 39:11.130
We're late for Lester.

39:15.719 --> 39:19.263
So tell me, Lotte, can you
understand a word I'm saying?

39:20.307 --> 39:22.099
Oh, yes, Dr. Lester.
Absolutely.

39:22.183 --> 39:25.728
You were just explaining
the nutritional value

39:25.979 --> 39:30.232
of ingesting minerals through a colloidal
form which I couldn't agree more with.

39:30.317 --> 39:32.484
Oh! Be still, my heart.

39:36.823 --> 39:40.284
Dr. Lester, would you mind pointing
me in the direction of the restroom?

39:40.368 --> 39:44.830
With the greatest pleasure, my dear.
You go up the grand escalier

39:45.999 --> 39:49.126
and once atop the stairs you'll
want to enter the, uh...

39:49.210 --> 39:53.088
fifth door on my left.
Watch the step down. It's sunken.

39:53.173 --> 39:55.007
Okay. Thank you.

40:54.067 --> 40:56.777
"Malkovich
Physical Development."

41:09.249 --> 41:13.085
What do you think Lester's
relationship with John Malkovich is?

41:15.714 --> 41:19.341
That portal's been boarded up forever.
I bet Lester's not even aware of it.

41:19.426 --> 41:21.885
Him, the portal. Why?

41:22.637 --> 41:24.388
No reason.
I was just thinking.

41:24.472 --> 41:28.058
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

41:28.143 --> 41:31.729
Do you think that it might have some
sort of significance, for example?

41:31.813 --> 41:34.398
I don't know.
Why do you think that?

41:34.482 --> 41:35.983
I don't even care.

41:36.067 --> 41:39.903
I think it's kind of sexy that
John Malkovich has a portal.

41:39.988 --> 41:42.698
Sort of like
it's like he's a vagina.

41:42.782 --> 41:44.992
It's sort of vaginal,
like he has a...

41:45.076 --> 41:47.494
he has a penis and a vagina.

41:48.163 --> 41:52.541
It's sort of like
Malkovich's feminine side.

41:54.669 --> 41:56.170
I like that.

41:59.632 --> 42:02.092
"Visit J.M. Inc.
Mertin Flemmer Building.

42:02.177 --> 42:05.137
"Nightly from 9:00 p.m.
to 4:00 a.m."

42:05.221 --> 42:06.388
Sounds good.

42:06.473 --> 42:08.223
Oblique but intriguing.
Phone it in.

42:08.308 --> 42:10.476
- Want me to phone it in?
- No.

42:13.188 --> 42:14.438
Lotte!

42:14.898 --> 42:17.149
Hi. I heard your voice.

42:17.484 --> 42:19.568
What are you doing here?

42:20.195 --> 42:22.905
Is this your partner?
She's pretty.

42:23.698 --> 42:27.326
I had to do the Malkovich ride
again, you know? Is this her?

42:27.410 --> 42:29.328
- Hi. You're Craig's wife?
- Yeah. Hi.

42:29.412 --> 42:31.830
Lotte, Maxine.
Maxine, Lotte.

42:32.165 --> 42:34.583
Have you done Malkovich yet?

42:34.667 --> 42:37.211
Uh, hi.
Yeah, I want to place an ad.

42:37.295 --> 42:39.338
Okay. "Ever want to be
someone else?"

42:39.422 --> 42:42.758
No, that's the ad, but we can
talk about you in a minute.

42:42.842 --> 42:47.554
"Ever want to be someone else?
Now you can. Visit J.M. Inc."

Inc. Mertin.

42:51.476 --> 42:53.602
You should really be at work.

42:56.564 --> 43:00.818
I've been going over and over my
experience last night, Craig.

43:02.403 --> 43:04.196
It was amazing.

43:05.865 --> 43:10.244
I've decided
that I'm a transsexual.

43:10.745 --> 43:12.621
I know it's
the craziest thing, Craig!

43:12.705 --> 43:13.789
What, are you fuckin' nuts?

43:13.873 --> 43:17.960
No. It's just that for the first
time, everything just felt right.

43:19.462 --> 43:21.380
I've got to make sure.

43:22.090 --> 43:24.550
But if the feeling
is still there,

43:26.386 --> 43:30.472
I'm going to talk to Dr.
Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.

43:30.557 --> 43:33.142
This is absurd!
Besides, Feldman is an allergist.

43:33.226 --> 43:34.560
If you're going to
do something, do it right.

43:34.644 --> 43:36.353
We talked about this
a million times.

43:36.437 --> 43:39.106
You get these half-assed ideas,
and then you do a half-assed job.

43:39.190 --> 43:40.190
Just drop it.

43:40.275 --> 43:42.151
It's just that I really,
you know,

43:42.235 --> 43:43.986
like Dr. Feldman. All right?

43:44.070 --> 43:46.738
So I thought that
I would ask him his opinion.

43:46.823 --> 43:49.408
Is there something
so terrible about that?

43:49.492 --> 43:51.034
Why do you always
yell at me like this?

43:51.119 --> 43:52.911
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

43:52.996 --> 43:57.457
It's just a phase. It's the thrill of
seeing through somebody else's eyes.

43:57.542 --> 43:59.168
Okay? It'll pass.

44:00.211 --> 44:02.838
Don't stand in the way
of my actualization as a man.

44:04.507 --> 44:06.300
Let her go, Craig.

44:06.384 --> 44:08.135
- Okay.
- I mean him.

44:09.262 --> 44:10.929
Right now?

44:12.682 --> 44:13.891
Uh-huh.

44:14.934 --> 44:17.895
It's the middle of the day.
How am I going to get her past Lester?

44:17.979 --> 44:19.313
Yawn. Figure it out.

44:19.397 --> 44:21.565
Okay. Let's go.
Come on.

44:22.275 --> 44:23.942
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:34.871 --> 44:36.788
Davey, it's Max.

44:37.498 --> 44:40.792
Listen, can you get me
John Malkovich's home phone?

44:41.669 --> 44:46.465
"But what I had been through.
I am hungry as the winter.

44:46.716 --> 44:50.636
"I am sick, anxious,
poor as a beggar.

"Fate has tossed me
hither and thither.

44:54.557 --> 44:57.184
"I have been everywhere.
Everywhere."

44:57.310 --> 44:59.686
- So strong.
- "But wherever I have been,

44:59.812 --> 45:02.189
- "every minute, day and night...
- I want that voice.

45:02.315 --> 45:06.485
- "my soul has been full of mysterious anticipations.
- My soul has been full...

45:06.611 --> 45:10.072
- of mysterious anticipation.
- "I feel the approach of happiness.

45:10.156 --> 45:12.616
"Anya, I see it coming."

45:17.830 --> 45:19.206
Yeah?

45:19.290 --> 45:21.708
- Mr. John Malkovich?
- Yeah. Who's calling?

45:21.793 --> 45:23.752
Oh, my goodness!

45:23.836 --> 45:26.213
You don't know me,
but I know you.

45:26.297 --> 45:28.465
I'm a great admirer of yours.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.134
How did you get this number?

45:31.678 --> 45:36.265
Well... it's just that I...
I... I dream about you.

45:36.349 --> 45:40.769
And well, even speaking to you now has
gotten me sort of excited, you know?

45:40.853 --> 45:44.064
Wow, the way
this woman's talking to him.

45:44.983 --> 45:47.192
Listen, I really don't
find this amusing.

45:47.318 --> 45:49.152
Don't call here
anymore, okay?

45:49.237 --> 45:52.739
Well! My nipples are at attention,
General Malkovich, sir.

45:52.824 --> 45:55.450
What, her nipples?

45:55.535 --> 45:58.203
So, listen, why don't we
have dinner tonight?

45:58.288 --> 46:02.291
Bernardo's? 8:00?
I really want to see you.

46:02.375 --> 46:05.544
I just loved you
in that jewel thief movie.

46:09.882 --> 46:11.633
You're not gonna
meet her there?

46:11.759 --> 46:13.176
Come on!

46:13.261 --> 46:16.555
Meet her. Meet her there.
Meet her there! Meet her there!

46:17.557 --> 46:21.518
I am sick,
anxious, poor as a beggar.

46:22.770 --> 46:24.813
Meet her there! Meet her there!
Meet her there!

46:24.897 --> 46:27.232
Meet her there! Meet her there!
Meet her there!

46:27.358 --> 46:29.318
Everywhere.

46:29.402 --> 46:30.986
But wherever I have been,

46:31.070 --> 46:32.779
every minute, day and night...

46:32.864 --> 46:35.574
Meet her there. Meet her there.
Meet her there.

46:35.658 --> 46:36.825
Yes!

46:43.207 --> 46:44.750
How was it?

46:45.043 --> 46:47.961
I have to go back
at 8:00 exactly, tonight.

46:49.130 --> 46:50.672
Why?

46:50.757 --> 46:52.174
Don't crowd me, Craig.

47:02.018 --> 47:04.186
Excuse me.
Are you John Malkovich?

47:04.270 --> 47:05.354
Yes, I am.

47:05.438 --> 47:10.025
Wow. You really are great in that
movie where you play that retard.

47:10.109 --> 47:12.069
Oh, thank you very much.

47:12.153 --> 47:13.695
I have a cousin
who's a retard.

47:13.780 --> 47:14.821
Oh. Thank you.

47:14.906 --> 47:16.740
So, as you might imagine,

47:17.950 --> 47:20.660
it means a lot to me
to see retards

47:21.454 --> 47:24.581
portrayed on the silver
screen so compassionately.

47:24.665 --> 47:27.501
Well, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

47:27.835 --> 47:29.461
Good night.

47:31.964 --> 47:33.131
Maxine?

47:34.384 --> 47:36.093
- It's Maxine.
- Hi.

47:36.177 --> 47:38.261
I'm so glad
you decided to come.

47:38.346 --> 47:39.638
I'm Maxine.

47:39.722 --> 47:41.723
I'm John.
How do you do?

47:42.225 --> 47:43.892
Good.

47:47.105 --> 47:49.314
I wasn't sure
I was going to come...

47:49.399 --> 47:52.150
but I felt, uh,
oddly compelled.

47:53.736 --> 47:57.155
You're so beautiful.
The way you're looking at me...

47:57.657 --> 47:59.991
I mean, at him... At us.

48:04.414 --> 48:07.833
I've never been looked at
like this by a woman before.

48:08.668 --> 48:10.252
I think I'm sweating.

48:10.336 --> 48:12.879
I must say, I was
intrigued by your voice.

48:13.965 --> 48:18.093
And the funny thing is, Mr.
Malkovich, my voice is probably

48:18.177 --> 48:19.928
the least intriguing thing
about me.

48:25.601 --> 48:27.310
So, I mean...

48:27.395 --> 48:29.855
So, how was it?
What was he doing?

48:30.273 --> 48:31.606
He wasn't doing anything
really.

48:31.691 --> 48:33.775
He was just
hanging around his apartment.

48:33.860 --> 48:38.155
I think he's probably just
a really, uh, lonely guy.

48:38.573 --> 48:41.116
See, men can feel
unfulfilled, too, Lotte.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.951
I'm glad you're coming
to realize that.

48:43.035 --> 48:45.328
You shouldn't be so quick to
assume that switching bodies

48:45.413 --> 48:48.373
is gonna be the answer
to your problems.

48:49.459 --> 48:51.877
You're right, Craig.
You're right.

48:54.422 --> 48:57.090
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe

48:57.175 --> 48:59.968
we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night

49:00.052 --> 49:03.138
because you guys are partners and I thought
that might be a really nice gesture.

49:03.222 --> 49:04.556
I think
she'd like that.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.224
- Maxine?
- What?

49:07.101 --> 49:10.187
The thing is, there's been some
tension between us at work,

49:10.271 --> 49:11.563
business stuff,

49:11.647 --> 49:13.148
and I would hate to
expose you to that.

49:13.232 --> 49:15.400
It'll be okay.

49:15.818 --> 49:17.194
I'll cook my lasagna,

49:17.278 --> 49:19.488
we'll smoke a joint,

49:20.490 --> 49:22.908
and tensions
will just melt away.

49:23.868 --> 49:28.246
Now, when you say that I can be somebody
else, what do you mean exactly?

49:28.664 --> 49:31.249
Well, we mean exactly that.

49:32.251 --> 49:36.254
We can put you inside someone
else's body for 15 minutes.

49:37.215 --> 49:39.591
Can I be anybody
that I wanna be?

49:40.927 --> 49:44.095
Well... You...
Actually...

49:44.514 --> 49:46.264
You can be John Malkovich.

49:46.349 --> 49:47.933
That's perfect!

49:48.017 --> 49:51.645
It's my second choice,
but it's wonderful. It's...

49:55.233 --> 49:56.900
I'm a fat man.

49:57.485 --> 49:59.819
- I am sad and fat...
- $200?

50:01.447 --> 50:03.281
Oh. Oh, uh, yes.

50:11.707 --> 50:14.668
Okay.
You gotta crawl in there.

50:14.961 --> 50:16.461
Oh, my God.

50:34.730 --> 50:35.855
No, that's what I'm saying.

50:35.940 --> 50:38.733
See, I don't really need
an extra bathmat.

50:38.818 --> 50:41.653
So if I get the set,
would it be possible

50:41.737 --> 50:46.533
if I could just get maybe
three extra hand towels...

50:47.493 --> 50:50.328
Uh, if I get the set
instead of the bathmat?

50:50.413 --> 50:52.414
Yes, sir.
Sure, we can do that.

50:52.498 --> 50:53.915
Great. That sounds good.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.752
And for the color, periwinkle?

50:58.129 --> 51:00.422
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're out of stock in periwinkle.

51:00.506 --> 51:02.674
Do you want to back order?

51:03.175 --> 51:06.970
No. I'll, uh,
go with the loden.

51:07.179 --> 51:09.264
Would you like to order
anything else?

51:09.348 --> 51:15.145
What is the difference between the
foot-pampering looped cotton rug

51:16.272 --> 51:17.897
and the bathmat?

51:33.247 --> 51:35.415
You're my friends.
Thank you.

51:36.042 --> 51:39.336
Did you know that
Eskimos have not one,

51:40.588 --> 51:44.424
but, 49 words for snow?

51:45.760 --> 51:46.760
Mmm.

51:46.844 --> 51:49.512
It's because
they have so much of it.

51:53.225 --> 51:55.226
So much snow.

51:57.063 --> 51:59.397
After dinner,
I'll show you my puppets.

51:59.482 --> 52:00.482
Ah.

52:00.566 --> 52:03.902
After dinner, I'll introduce
you to my chimp Elijah.

52:05.613 --> 52:09.532
He has an ulcer right now due
to suppressed childhood trauma.

52:10.076 --> 52:11.368
But we're working through it.

52:14.830 --> 52:16.623
Psychotherapy.

52:16.707 --> 52:17.791
Oh.

52:36.936 --> 52:38.728
This the bedroom?

52:38.854 --> 52:40.814
Yeah.

52:42.608 --> 52:45.318
The thing is,
the way that I see it,

52:45.403 --> 52:48.321
is, I think
the world is divided

52:48.406 --> 52:50.699
into those
who go after what they want

52:50.783 --> 52:53.702
- and then those who don't, right?
- Right.

52:53.786 --> 52:57.372
The passionate ones, the ones
who go after what they want,

52:57.456 --> 53:00.542
well, they may not get
what they want.

53:03.713 --> 53:06.548
But, at least
they remain vital.

53:06.632 --> 53:08.133
Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:08.217 --> 53:13.346
So when they lie on their death
beds, they have, um, few regrets.

53:14.014 --> 53:15.306
Right?

53:20.312 --> 53:23.398
And the ones who don't
go after what they want,

53:23.482 --> 53:26.985
well, who gives a shit
about them, anyway?

53:30.156 --> 53:32.490
- God! Craig!
- Lotte!

53:33.701 --> 53:37.370
I don't find you attractive,
hmm? And, Lotte,

53:38.581 --> 53:40.707
I'm smitten with you.

53:40.791 --> 53:43.501
I am, but only
when you're in Malkovich.

53:43.586 --> 53:46.629
When I looked into his eyes last
night, I could feel you peering out.

53:46.714 --> 53:48.339
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:48.841 --> 53:50.925
Behind the stubble
and the too prominent brow

53:51.010 --> 53:53.178
and the male-pattern baldness,

53:53.262 --> 53:55.638
I sensed
your feminine longing.

53:56.599 --> 53:59.392
And it just slew me.

53:59.477 --> 54:00.977
Oh, my God!

54:01.937 --> 54:03.146
Oh!

54:03.522 --> 54:05.523
Only as John, sweetie.

54:06.150 --> 54:07.484
Sorry.

54:09.195 --> 54:11.696
Hey, thanks for
a wonderful dinner.

54:13.032 --> 54:15.116
No hard feelings, partner?

54:32.718 --> 54:35.136
- J.M. Inc.
- Hi. It's Lotte.

54:35.888 --> 54:38.389
I'd like very much
to see you again.

54:39.058 --> 54:41.851
Can you call him
and invite yourself over?

54:42.353 --> 54:44.229
Um, when?

54:46.398 --> 54:50.193
Mmm, tonight,
after you close?

54:50.861 --> 54:53.863
Okay, uh, 4:11.

54:55.533 --> 54:57.033
4:11?

54:57.493 --> 54:59.160
Thank you, Maxine.

54:59.370 --> 55:00.995
You're welcome.

55:30.025 --> 55:32.819
Thanks so much for having
me over, sugarplum.

55:32.903 --> 55:34.696
I'm glad you called.

55:34.780 --> 55:36.865
Shall we to the boudoir?

55:40.452 --> 55:42.745
A couple of minutes.
I'm early.

55:58.262 --> 56:01.848
So do... do you enjoy being
an actor?

56:04.894 --> 56:07.896
Sure. Yeah.
It's... it's very rewarding.

56:25.789 --> 56:26.915
Hi.

56:27.666 --> 56:28.833
Hi.

56:43.140 --> 56:45.224
Oh, my sweet Maxine.

56:45.893 --> 56:48.227
- My darling.
- I love you, Lotte.

56:54.860 --> 56:57.070
Did you call me Lotte?

57:02.326 --> 57:03.952
Do you mind?

57:06.789 --> 57:08.539
No, not really.

57:09.875 --> 57:11.459
Oh!
- Oh, God.

57:11.543 --> 57:14.253
- My sweet, beautiful Lotte.
- Oh!

57:14.630 --> 57:16.547
Oh, Maxine!

57:16.632 --> 57:18.967
Yes, Maxine. Yes.

57:19.051 --> 57:21.844
Maxine, this is...
this is so right.

57:21.929 --> 57:24.222
Oh! Oh, God.

57:34.024 --> 57:36.609
- Yes! Wow!
- Yes! Wow!

58:11.478 --> 58:13.688
You were him, weren't you?

58:13.772 --> 58:14.897
Yeah.

58:14.982 --> 58:16.774
And he was with her!

58:17.860 --> 58:18.985
We love her, Craig.

58:19.069 --> 58:20.236
"We"?

58:20.320 --> 58:21.362
John and me.

58:21.447 --> 58:22.488
Don't forget about me!

58:22.573 --> 58:24.866
Well, you have the Maxine
action figure to play with!

58:27.286 --> 58:29.787
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

58:59.735 --> 59:01.986
You are late,
my little cowboy.

59:04.907 --> 59:07.325
Are you torturing me
on purpose?

59:08.285 --> 59:09.994
I've fallen in love.

59:10.454 --> 59:12.371
I don't think so.

59:12.498 --> 59:15.333
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!

59:15.542 --> 59:17.668
And this is what people who
have fallen in love look like.

59:17.753 --> 59:20.421
Well, you picked
the unrequited variety.

59:20.506 --> 59:22.757
It's very bad for the skin.

59:26.929 --> 59:28.888
You're evil, Maxine.

59:29.264 --> 59:32.600
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you

59:32.684 --> 59:36.687
with total lust and devotion
through the same pair of eyes?

59:39.108 --> 59:40.358
Wow.

59:40.943 --> 59:43.027
No, I don't suppose you would.

59:43.112 --> 59:44.821
It's quite a thrill, Craigy.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.163
Ahh! What are you doing?

01:00:35.247 --> 01:00:36.998
Oh, my God! Is that real?

01:00:37.082 --> 01:00:38.082
- Yes!
- What is that?

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.709
I don't know
how to use it very well,

01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:42.545
so don't
make any sudden moves!

01:00:45.048 --> 01:00:47.800
I'm serious! I'm serious.

01:00:47.926 --> 01:00:49.427
Suck my dick!

01:00:50.929 --> 01:00:53.306
Shut up, okay?
Just shut up.

01:01:09.615 --> 01:01:10.740
Craig!

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:16.913
J.M. Inc. Be all
that someone else can be.

01:01:17.706 --> 01:01:19.207
I need to see you.

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:20.791
Sweetie!

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.045
Oh, I had so much fun
with you last night.

01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:26.339
Shoot.
But it's business hours.

01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:31.719
Tell her what the hell,
close early, live dangerously.

01:01:31.803 --> 01:01:33.221
Say it.

01:01:35.182 --> 01:01:37.642
What the hell, you know?

01:01:39.853 --> 01:01:42.521
Live dangerously. Close early.

01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:44.148
Ooh, doll.

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:47.360
I love this new
devil-may-care side of you.

01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:53.074
All righty. I'll track down lover boy
and see both of you in one hour.

01:01:53.158 --> 01:01:54.700
Exactamundo.

01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:01.707
Craig!

01:02:02.793 --> 01:02:05.253
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!

01:02:05.337 --> 01:02:08.339
Sit up, okay?
Just sit up. Just sit up.

01:02:16.306 --> 01:02:19.642
Help!
He's locking me in a cage!

01:02:21.687 --> 01:02:23.396
Shut up!

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.231
Shut up!

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:39.370
Was ever woman
in this humor wooed?

01:02:40.038 --> 01:02:42.790
Was ever woman
in this humor won?

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:50.715
Tommy, can I take 15?

01:02:53.218 --> 01:02:57.596
Good night, everybody.
See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:04.103
Oh!

01:03:04.229 --> 01:03:06.397
Oh, Lotte.

01:03:07.232 --> 01:03:09.525
Lotte, this is so good!

01:03:11.236 --> 01:03:13.571
My God! This is amazing.
Lotte!

01:03:14.406 --> 01:03:17.491
I want to touch her breast.
Touch her breast.

01:03:18.076 --> 01:03:20.328
Move right hand
across left breast now.

01:03:20.412 --> 01:03:22.872
- Lotte! - Move right hand
across left breast now!

01:03:22.956 --> 01:03:24.915
Move right hand
across left breast now.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.167
Holy shit, yes!

01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:27.918
Holy shit, yes!

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:29.503
Holy shit,
he said what I said!

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.589
Shit, he said what I said!

01:03:31.882 --> 01:03:34.508
Lotte? Is that you?

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:36.010
Yes, yes, sweetheart.

01:03:36.094 --> 01:03:37.970
Yes, sweetheart, yes.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.264
What the fuck is going on?

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.308
That's not me!
I didn't say that.

01:03:42.392 --> 01:03:43.559
Oh, Lotte.

01:03:43.643 --> 01:03:44.935
Oh, Maxine. Oh...

01:03:47.397 --> 01:03:49.565
Something was making me talk.

01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:52.651
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.

01:03:52.736 --> 01:03:55.154
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Oh, doll face!

01:03:55.238 --> 01:03:58.657
It was just, uh, your
passion for me taking hold.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:03.788
No, doll face. I know what my
passion taking hold feels like.

01:04:03.872 --> 01:04:05.039
Bye!

01:04:05.332 --> 01:04:06.707
I did it!

01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:12.129
I made him move his arms across
your girlfriend's glorious tit!

01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:16.509
Oh, and
I made him talk sort of.

01:04:17.886 --> 01:04:19.720
It's just a matter of practice

01:04:19.805 --> 01:04:24.892
before Malkovich is nothing more than another
puppet hanging next to my work table.

01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:29.397
I'll tell you about it when I
get home, okay? All right?

01:04:29.481 --> 01:04:32.983
Craig! Craig!
I wanna...

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.079
No, man, I'm sorry to...

01:04:45.163 --> 01:04:47.581
I'm sorry to have
called you like that,

01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:50.334
but I was just really,
really scared.

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:52.253
I was so freaked out.

01:04:52.337 --> 01:04:57.425
I mean, it was like somebody was
just moving all the way through me,

01:04:57.509 --> 01:05:00.386
moving my arms, moving my
hands, talking for me.

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.764
I mean, literally, I feel
like I'm going crazy, Charlie.

01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:05.599
I'm sure
you're not going crazy.

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:08.018
You don't understand, man.
It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

01:05:08.103 --> 01:05:11.021
Yeah, yada, yada, yada.
Were you stoned?

01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:13.315
Yes. Yes, I was... Jesus.

01:05:16.194 --> 01:05:18.529
Yes! Yes, I was stoned.

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.657
But what... That doesn't have
anything to do with it.

01:05:21.741 --> 01:05:24.285
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.

01:05:24.369 --> 01:05:26.328
You were stoned.

01:05:26.413 --> 01:05:28.539
Case closed. End of story.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.042
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?

01:05:32.544 --> 01:05:35.296
Maybe it was this
Lotte woman talking

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.174
because it could have been her
talking through me.

01:05:38.258 --> 01:05:39.758
Because this...

01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:43.262
The weird thing is this Maxine
likes to call me Lotte.

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:46.182
Ouch. That is hot.

01:05:47.225 --> 01:05:50.811
Maybe she's using you to channel
some dead, lesbian lover.

01:05:50.896 --> 01:05:53.314
Sounds like my kind of gal.
Let me know when you're done with her, yeah?

01:05:53.398 --> 01:05:57.610
What are you talking about? Done with her, man?
Tonight really freaked me out.

01:05:57.694 --> 01:06:00.154
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.

01:06:00.238 --> 01:06:01.322
I'll tell you that
as a friend.

01:06:01.406 --> 01:06:03.908
Charlie, I don't know
anything about the girl.

01:06:03.992 --> 01:06:06.368
She could be, like,
a fucking witch or something.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.162
That's even better!

01:06:08.246 --> 01:06:11.916
Hot, lesbian witches. Think about it.
It's fucking genius.

01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:16.420
I gotta know the truth,
Charlie.

01:06:17.422 --> 01:06:20.007
The truth is for suckers,
Johnny boy.

01:07:04.177 --> 01:07:05.553
Thanks.

01:07:54.477 --> 01:07:55.603
Excuse me, sir.

01:07:55.687 --> 01:07:59.732
Exactly what, uh, type of service
does this company provide?

01:07:59.983 --> 01:08:02.860
You get to be John Malkovich
for 15 minutes.

01:08:03.361 --> 01:08:05.321
Two hundred clams.

01:08:07.574 --> 01:08:08.949
I see.

01:08:09.784 --> 01:08:11.952
No cutting, by the way. No cutting!
- Hey, what the hell?

01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:21.420
Come on! Break it up!
Break it up! Cut it out!

01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:22.880
Everybody gets...

01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:24.715
It's him.
It's John Malkovich.

01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:27.216
I'm sorry, Mr. Malkovich.
I hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.

01:08:27.301 --> 01:08:28.761
Get inside!

01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:33.223
- Darling!
- What the fuck is going on?

01:08:33.308 --> 01:08:35.559
- Uh, uh, John Malkovich.
- Huh?

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.560
Mr. Malkovich, sir.

01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:43.192
Mr. Malkovich,
I think I can explain.

01:08:43.276 --> 01:08:44.652
Yeah, explain.

01:08:44.736 --> 01:08:46.819
My name is Craig Schwartz

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.657
and we operate
a little business here

01:08:49.741 --> 01:08:52.910
that simulates,
for our clientele, well, the...

01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:57.872
the experience of... of...
of being you, actually.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:08:59.166
Simulates?

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.001
Yeah, after a fashion.

01:09:01.086 --> 01:09:03.127
What exactly does that mean?

01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:04.880
Well, it's hard to describe.

01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:06.048
I want to do it then.

01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:08.175
That would pale in comparison
to the actual experience.

01:09:08.259 --> 01:09:09.551
I want to do it!

01:09:09.636 --> 01:09:11.178
Right now
Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...

01:09:11.261 --> 01:09:13.138
Let him do it, Craig.

01:09:13.723 --> 01:09:15.849
Of course.
Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.935
compliments of the house.

01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:27.569
Jesus.

01:09:42.794 --> 01:09:46.130
What happens when a man
goes through his own portal?

01:09:47.465 --> 01:09:48.799
We'll see.

01:10:19.831 --> 01:10:21.707
Malkovich.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.418
Malkovich, Malkovich.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.880
Malkovich, Malkovich.

01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:30.382
Malkovich, Malkovich,
Malkovich?

01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:32.342
Malkovich, Malkovich.

01:10:32.677 --> 01:10:34.094
Malkovich?

01:10:42.604 --> 01:10:44.062
Malkovich!

01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:45.522
Malkovich.

01:10:47.859 --> 01:10:49.193
Malkovich.

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.071
Malkovich. Malkovich.

01:10:57.368 --> 01:10:58.952
Malkovich!

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:02.080
Malkovich, Malkovich

01:11:02.165 --> 01:11:05.542
Malkovich, Malkovich

01:11:05.668 --> 01:11:07.211
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich.

01:11:07.337 --> 01:11:09.630
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich.

01:11:10.298 --> 01:11:13.175
Malkovich, Malkovich

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:17.554
Malkovich, Malkovich

01:11:18.139 --> 01:11:20.933
- Malkovich, Malkovich
- Malkovich!

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:30.192
How was it?

01:11:30.276 --> 01:11:31.860
It was amazing this time.

01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:33.529
That was no simulation!

01:11:33.613 --> 01:11:35.322
I know. I'm sorry.

01:11:35.406 --> 01:11:36.782
It's such an honor.

01:11:36.866 --> 01:11:38.492
I have been to the dark side.

01:11:38.576 --> 01:11:40.994
I have seen a world
that no man should see!

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:44.456
Really? For most people, it's
a rather pleasant experience.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.166
That portal is mine,

01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:50.045
and it must be sealed forever
for the love of God.

01:11:51.381 --> 01:11:54.800
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect,

01:11:55.343 --> 01:11:59.179
I discovered that portal.
It's my livelihood. Do you understand?

01:11:59.264 --> 01:12:03.725
It's my head, Schwartz!
It's my head!

01:12:05.144 --> 01:12:07.229
I will see you in court!

01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:14.486
What makes you think I won't be
seeing what you're seeing in court?

01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:16.530
Hey, Malkovich, think fast!

01:12:18.825 --> 01:12:20.033
Fuck!

01:12:20.994 --> 01:12:22.494
Dinner.

01:12:23.538 --> 01:12:28.584
You know, Craig, once this was
a relationship built on love.

01:12:30.044 --> 01:12:31.920
Well, you gave up that claim

01:12:32.005 --> 01:12:34.882
after the first time you stuck
your dick in Maxine, Lotte.

01:12:34.966 --> 01:12:36.967
You fell in love with her
first, Craig.

01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:41.680
Yeah, but I didn't do anything about
it, out of respect for our marriage.

01:12:41.973 --> 01:12:44.725
You didn't do anything
about it, Craig,

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:50.439
out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't
let you near her with a ten-foot pole!

01:12:56.696 --> 01:12:58.113
That's true.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.078
God, Lotte,
what have I become?

01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:09.833
My wife in a cage
with a monkey.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:14.379
Craig. I need to go to the
bathroom and take a shower.

01:13:21.638 --> 01:13:24.222
What am I,
some kind of monster?

01:13:25.808 --> 01:13:28.560
I don't want to be a monster,
Lotte. I don't want to.

01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:31.063
Craig, you're not a monster.
No.

01:13:32.023 --> 01:13:33.899
I know you're not a monster,
honey.

01:13:33.983 --> 01:13:36.360
You're just... You're just

01:13:36.444 --> 01:13:40.030
a very, very confused man.

01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:44.993
I love you so much.

01:13:48.873 --> 01:13:50.374
I love you.

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:01.635
Come on, Craig.

01:14:10.186 --> 01:14:12.396
- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine?

01:14:13.272 --> 01:14:14.564
Lotte.

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:18.068
I've been thinking about us,
you know? And, uh...

01:14:18.152 --> 01:14:19.569
We have to meet.

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:22.781
Um, okay. I'll see you in
Malkovich in one hour.

01:14:23.574 --> 01:14:25.409
Craig!

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.454
I hate you.

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:53.205
Oh, Elijah!
You really are magnificent.

01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.586
- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine!

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:02.422
Honey pie! I was just heading
out the door to meet you.

01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:06.510
No, listen, Maxine.
It hasn't been me in Malkovich the last time.

01:16:06.594 --> 01:16:08.095
It's been that
son of a bitch, Craig.

01:16:08.179 --> 01:16:10.472
He's had me locked in the cage
with my chimp,

01:16:10.556 --> 01:16:12.933
- holding a gun to my head.
He made me call you. - Oh, my God!

01:16:13.017 --> 01:16:15.310
I'm sorry, Maxine.
It's been him the whole time.

01:16:15.394 --> 01:16:17.896
I'm so sorry.
That's horrible.

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.398
I miss you so much, Maxine.

01:16:20.483 --> 01:16:21.900
So... But...

01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:24.736
Okay, that was Craig
inside of Malkovich?

01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:28.365
Yes, it was him.
It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.

01:16:28.866 --> 01:16:31.326
Well, boy, I'm, uh...

01:16:32.078 --> 01:16:34.121
I'm surprised.
That's pretty impressive.

01:16:34.205 --> 01:16:35.372
What?

01:16:35.456 --> 01:16:37.999
So if Craig
can control Malkovich,

01:16:38.167 --> 01:16:40.919
- and I can control Craig...
- But, Maxine,

01:16:41.212 --> 01:16:43.672
I thought it was me
that you loved!

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:45.632
I do.

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:54.182
It's confusing, you know?
This is a very confusing situation.

01:16:55.059 --> 01:16:56.351
I know.

01:16:59.939 --> 01:17:03.608
Listen, I
should really get going, okay?

01:17:03.693 --> 01:17:06.403
- 'Cause I'm gonna be late
for Malkovich now. - No.

01:17:06.487 --> 01:17:07.571
What?

01:17:07.655 --> 01:17:09.322
We'll talk about this later,
Lotte.

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:11.074
Maxine! Wait!

01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:13.827
- Okay?
- Maxine!

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.320
What the fuck do you want?

01:17:48.696 --> 01:17:51.406
I can explain
about the portal, darling.

01:17:54.952 --> 01:17:57.370
Listen, don't con me, Maxine.

01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.039
I don't know
who the hell you people are,

01:17:59.123 --> 01:18:01.750
but this insanity is now over.

01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:03.376
Oh, shut up.

01:18:04.629 --> 01:18:06.880
Craigy. Craig.

01:18:07.632 --> 01:18:09.341
Schwartzy, are you in there?

01:18:14.513 --> 01:18:16.973
How did you
know it was me?

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:20.143
Lotte called me.
She escaped your evil clutches.

01:18:21.979 --> 01:18:24.856
Really? Well, I'm really sorry
I did that, Maxine,

01:18:24.941 --> 01:18:26.233
but I'm
really in love with you,

01:18:26.317 --> 01:18:28.944
and I didn't know
how else to be with you.

01:18:29.028 --> 01:18:30.195
Hmm.

01:18:31.989 --> 01:18:34.574
Apparently you can control
this Malkovich fellow now?

01:18:34.659 --> 01:18:37.160
Yes, I'm getting
better all the time.

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.037
I'll say you are.

01:18:39.121 --> 01:18:42.165
Hey, let's do it
on his dining room table.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.584
Then we'll make him
eat an omelet off of it.

01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:46.211
No!

01:18:46.295 --> 01:18:48.088
Shut up,
you overrated sack of shit!

01:18:51.133 --> 01:18:52.342
Craigy.

01:19:17.576 --> 01:19:18.827
Yes?

01:19:20.079 --> 01:19:22.956
Hi, Dr. Lester.
It's Lotte Schwartz,

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:25.667
Craig's wife.

01:19:25.751 --> 01:19:28.628
Oh! Yes. Oh, my God.

01:19:28.713 --> 01:19:31.464
You'll catch your death out here.
Look at you. You're soaking wet.

01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:33.717
Please come in, come in.

01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:42.475
Here you are, my dear.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.977
Thank you.

01:19:45.479 --> 01:19:46.855
How's that?

01:19:47.064 --> 01:19:49.065
Much better, thank you.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.236
So, my dear, what is it that
brings you to my doorway

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.697
on such
an inhospitable evening?

01:19:55.781 --> 01:19:57.449
Well, Dr. Lester,

01:19:57.825 --> 01:19:59.409
see, I, uh...

01:20:00.786 --> 01:20:04.289
I have a very unhealthy
obsession with John Malkovich.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.417
I see.

01:20:07.668 --> 01:20:09.794
You mean, the performer.

01:20:10.963 --> 01:20:12.130
Yes.

01:20:12.214 --> 01:20:16.259
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?

01:20:16.761 --> 01:20:20.013
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner,

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:25.685
I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort of John Malkovich museum.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.272
So I thought
perhaps maybe you would

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.317
have some appreciation
for my state of mind.

01:20:35.154 --> 01:20:37.280
You look so lovely, my dear,

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:41.159
standing here before the fire
in my oversized man's robe.

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.580
Thank you, Dr. Lester.

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.334
Tell me,

01:20:50.127 --> 01:20:53.463
what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?

01:20:54.298 --> 01:20:56.424
You've gotta help me
understand because

01:20:56.509 --> 01:20:59.260
all I think about
is wanting to be him.

01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:03.264
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.

01:21:03.724 --> 01:21:06.142
Wanting to be John Malkovich.

01:21:07.853 --> 01:21:09.354
Oh, I see.

01:21:10.523 --> 01:21:13.441
Well, perhaps you can.

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:15.693
But, Dr. Lester...

01:21:15.778 --> 01:21:18.988
I am not Dr. Lester.

01:21:19.824 --> 01:21:21.658
I am Captain Mertin.

01:21:22.993 --> 01:21:24.619
I don't understand.

01:21:24.703 --> 01:21:29.249
It was 90 years ago that I
discovered a strange portal.

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:33.586
And... And I found that this
portal led to a vessel body

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:37.715
and that I could live forever by
leaping from vessel to vessel.

01:21:41.178 --> 01:21:43.346
So Dr. Lester
is such a vessel?

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.014
Yes, he is.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:48.435
You still there, sweets?

01:21:48.519 --> 01:21:49.936
Hmm.

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:55.817
I figured out how to hang on
as long as I want.

01:21:56.235 --> 01:21:59.571
It's all a matter of making
friends with the Malkovich body.

01:21:59.655 --> 01:22:03.908
Rather than thinking of it as an enemy
that has to be pounded into submission,

01:22:03.993 --> 01:22:08.872
I've begun imagining it as a really
expensive suit that I enjoy wearing.

01:22:17.298 --> 01:22:22.552
Ah, this illustrates how I will move
into my next vessel, Malkovich,

01:22:23.012 --> 01:22:24.804
on his 44th birthday.

01:22:25.139 --> 01:22:26.890
That's when he becomes ripe.

01:22:26.974 --> 01:22:29.934
But I must enter
by midnight on that day.

01:22:30.019 --> 01:22:34.731
After that, I'd get diverted into the
next newly forming infant vessel.

01:22:35.107 --> 01:22:36.816
I don't want that to happen.

01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:38.693
I'd be absorbed.

01:22:39.069 --> 01:22:40.695
Absorbed?
What does that mean?

01:22:40.779 --> 01:22:45.074
Well, uh, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain,

01:22:45.242 --> 01:22:47.035
unable to control anything,

01:22:47.119 --> 01:22:51.080
forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:55.877
Now I'd like you
to meet some friends.

01:22:55.961 --> 01:22:58.213
See, I got lonely
in Lester by myself,

01:22:58.297 --> 01:23:02.008
so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.

01:23:02.092 --> 01:23:03.176
Come.

01:23:08.724 --> 01:23:10.975
Everyone, this is Lotte.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.685
Hi, Lotte!

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:14.646
She's a new friend of mine.

01:23:20.069 --> 01:23:23.112
Do a puppet show for me,
Craig, honey.

01:23:24.114 --> 01:23:26.199
You mean, with Malkovich?

01:23:26.742 --> 01:23:28.910
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?

01:23:28.994 --> 01:23:30.620
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

01:23:32.665 --> 01:23:33.957
Okay.

01:23:43.092 --> 01:23:49.097
This is something that I call "Craig's
Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

01:25:21.857 --> 01:25:25.902
That was incredible!
You're... You're brilliant!

01:25:26.236 --> 01:25:29.864
You see, Maxine, it isn't
just playing with dolls.

01:25:30.741 --> 01:25:33.159
Oh, my darling,
it's so much more!

01:25:33.243 --> 01:25:35.411
It's playing with people.

01:25:40.918 --> 01:25:42.877
Stay in him forever.

01:25:45.547 --> 01:25:47.799
My darling, how will we make
a living if our clientele

01:25:47.883 --> 01:25:50.426
doesn't have access
to our product?

01:25:50.511 --> 01:25:54.347
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account,

01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:56.474
plus he does get
acting work occasionally.

01:25:56.558 --> 01:25:58.434
No, please!

01:25:59.061 --> 01:26:00.978
Shut up!
We're trying to think here.

01:26:01.063 --> 01:26:02.271
Gee!

01:26:03.941 --> 01:26:08.027
It is... It is sort of
like puppeteering.

01:26:08.445 --> 01:26:10.613
I-I-I like that about it.

01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:12.240
Exactly!

01:26:13.242 --> 01:26:17.286
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:22.709
And I could use
Malkovich's existing notoriety

01:26:22.793 --> 01:26:25.461
to launch my own
puppeteering career.

01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:28.381
Oh, Craigy.
Craigy, that's brilliant.

01:26:28.465 --> 01:26:29.841
Oh. Oh.

01:26:29.925 --> 01:26:31.008
So lovely.

01:26:31.093 --> 01:26:33.970
I've always wondered what it
would be like to have a penis.

01:26:34.054 --> 01:26:35.555
- Now I'll know.
- Really?

01:26:35.639 --> 01:26:37.640
- I know it's very...
- Lotte?

01:26:38.183 --> 01:26:39.726
We like you.

01:26:39.977 --> 01:26:42.937
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman

01:26:43.272 --> 01:26:45.148
and so,

01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:49.652
we've decided to offer you a
place in John Malkovich with us,

01:26:50.028 --> 01:26:51.654
if you like.

01:26:56.243 --> 01:26:57.785
Dr. Lester,

01:26:58.454 --> 01:27:02.290
you've been so kind to me
and trusting.

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:08.963
And there's just something I think you
should know about the Malkovich vessel.

01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:12.008
John's here to see you.
Should I send him in?

01:27:12.092 --> 01:27:15.845
Of course send him right in.
Don't ever keep him waiting again, you understand?

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.100
Hey, John.

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:22.977
Great to see you.

01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:24.771
Sorry about the cunt
at reception.

01:27:24.855 --> 01:27:26.939
This is my fiancee,
Maxine.

01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:28.775
Oh, great to see you,
Maxine.

01:27:28.859 --> 01:27:29.984
Sorry about the cunt
at reception.

01:27:30.068 --> 01:27:32.028
Please, have a seat.

01:27:36.867 --> 01:27:39.911
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Water?

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.871
No, thank you.

01:27:42.247 --> 01:27:44.624
- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- Okay.

01:27:44.708 --> 01:27:46.709
Chicken soup?
Chicken soup?

01:27:53.133 --> 01:27:57.136
Larry? Uh, I want to
get right to the point.

01:27:57.221 --> 01:28:00.598
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.

01:28:01.725 --> 01:28:03.559
Okay. Great.

01:28:08.398 --> 01:28:11.567
And I would like
to redirect my career

01:28:11.652 --> 01:28:14.612
so that from now on
the name John Malkovich,

01:28:14.696 --> 01:28:17.949
will be synonymous
with puppets.

01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:20.868
Sure. Sure. No problemo.

01:28:20.953 --> 01:28:22.495
Poof, you're a puppeteer.

01:28:22.579 --> 01:28:25.039
Just let me
make a couple calls.

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.355
Honey?

01:28:50.983 --> 01:28:53.276
Maxine? Maxine?

01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:55.611
I'm busy.

01:28:58.323 --> 01:29:00.324
Maxine, honey, it's on!

01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:11.210
Yeah, there's the truth,
and there are lies

01:29:11.295 --> 01:29:14.964
and, uh, art always tells the
truth, even when it's lying.

01:29:15.048 --> 01:29:17.508
The enigmatic John Malkovich,

01:29:17.593 --> 01:29:19.552
one of the world's
greatest entertainers

01:29:19.636 --> 01:29:22.889
and the man who reinvented
how we view puppeteering.

01:29:22.973 --> 01:29:25.558
Tonight we look at the man
above the strings

01:29:25.642 --> 01:29:27.977
and the woman behind the man.

01:29:28.478 --> 01:29:33.065
Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich
had a lifelong interest in theater arts

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:35.568
and as a young man was
one of the founding members

01:29:35.652 --> 01:29:39.280
of Chicago's world-renowned
Steppenwolf Theatre Company.

01:29:39.364 --> 01:29:41.574
From there, it was a simple
hop, skip and a jump

01:29:41.658 --> 01:29:44.577
to Broadway accolades
and Hollywood stardom.

01:29:44.661 --> 01:29:48.748
But nothing could prepare the
public for what was to come next.

01:29:49.499 --> 01:29:52.084
And so it was that just
eight short months ago,

01:29:52.169 --> 01:29:54.253
John Malkovich
dropped the bombshell

01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:57.298
that sent shock waves through
the entertainment community.

01:29:57.382 --> 01:29:59.759
Turning his back on
his former profession,

01:29:59.843 --> 01:30:01.886
Malkovich had to
start from scratch

01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:05.431
and pay his dues all over again
as a fledgling puppeteer.

01:30:05.515 --> 01:30:09.602
Hello, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm John Malkovich.

01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:13.606
It's... It's the... I miss...
I'm really John Malkovich.

01:30:14.441 --> 01:30:16.567
From these
inauspicious beginnings...

01:30:16.652 --> 01:30:20.571
John Malkovich's rise to
stardom was fast and furious.

01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:23.699
His breakout performance occurred
at this year's Emmy Awards...

01:30:24.034 --> 01:30:25.534
It's really good!

01:30:25.619 --> 01:30:28.329
I look really amazing.
I'd fuck me.

01:30:28.914 --> 01:30:30.957
If there's anything
that upsets me about it,

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:33.918
it's feeling like
if I move into it too quickly,

01:30:34.002 --> 01:30:36.462
I'll be, you know,
deemed an imitator.

01:30:36.546 --> 01:30:39.632
But, um, I think that once
we all get the courage

01:30:39.716 --> 01:30:42.593
to just follow through on our
instincts, like Malkovich has,

01:30:42.678 --> 01:30:45.554
I think that, uh, a lot of us
will move into puppetry.

01:30:45.639 --> 01:30:47.139
Malkovich's
rise to fame

01:30:47.224 --> 01:30:49.642
brought about
a renaissance in puppeteering.

01:30:49.726 --> 01:30:52.311
No, no, no. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:30:52.396 --> 01:30:53.813
I'm making him weep, John.

01:30:53.897 --> 01:30:57.066
You're making him weep,
but you are not weeping.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:58.901
Don't ever
with your audience.

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:04.991
Until the... the puppet becomes an
extension of you, it's a novelty act.

01:31:05.075 --> 01:31:07.743
It's, uh... It's Topo Gigio.

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:09.412
No?

01:31:12.165 --> 01:31:14.166
He's a technical genius.

01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:17.044
He breathes life
into inanimate objects.

01:31:17.421 --> 01:31:22.008
It's a very godlike thing to
be able to take something and,

01:31:22.092 --> 01:31:24.010
you know, make it live.

01:31:24.094 --> 01:31:28.431
He was the talk of the
town from the Beltway to Broadway

01:31:29.224 --> 01:31:33.352
aided in no small part by his new
wife and manager, Maxine Lund.

01:31:33.937 --> 01:31:36.814
In Maxine,
Malkovich had found his mentor

01:31:36.898 --> 01:31:39.442
his muse, his inspiration.

01:31:39.943 --> 01:31:44.113
In Malkovich, Maxine had
found the love of her life.

01:31:45.490 --> 01:31:47.783
There, there, my dear. Relax.

01:31:48.785 --> 01:31:51.871
This travesty will all
be over with by morning.

01:31:52.122 --> 01:31:54.874
And the crowds have been
absolutely sensational

01:31:54.958 --> 01:31:58.335
and, um, I'd just like to thank God
for giving us this opportunity

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.421
to share our creative vision.

01:32:00.505 --> 01:32:01.797
Nothing was impossible

01:32:01.882 --> 01:32:04.216
for John and Maxine
in the early days.

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.135
Their union was a joyous one,

01:32:06.219 --> 01:32:07.887
and together
they worked tirelessly

01:32:07.971 --> 01:32:10.389
to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.

01:32:10.474 --> 01:32:15.102
John Malkovich, the artist,
and Maxine, the entrepreneur,

01:32:15.187 --> 01:32:17.229
they make this character,

01:32:17.314 --> 01:32:21.025
this protean figure
that we call John Malkovich.

01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:25.237
But some say Maxine has changed
since becoming pregnant,

01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:28.616
recoiling from the limelight
and, rumor has it,

01:32:28.992 --> 01:32:31.452
from her husband's affections.

01:32:39.377 --> 01:32:41.629
I'm so sorry.

01:32:46.968 --> 01:32:49.512
Malkovich shows us

01:32:50.013 --> 01:32:53.349
a reflection of ourselves,
our frailties

01:32:53.558 --> 01:32:56.644
and our, you know,

01:32:56.728 --> 01:32:58.854
desperate humanity.

01:32:59.439 --> 01:33:03.567
That's what makes him one of the
most relevant artists of our time.

01:33:04.277 --> 01:33:07.947
And what does the future
hold for John Horatio Malkovich?

01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:12.451
Well, to quote the Bard, "He's
got the world on a string."

01:33:12.536 --> 01:33:14.161
As the poet said,

01:33:14.246 --> 01:33:17.790
"The puppeteer's voice need not
merely be the record of man.

01:33:17.874 --> 01:33:20.167
"It can be one of the pillars,
the props,

01:33:20.252 --> 01:33:22.503
"to help him endure
and prevail."

01:33:22.587 --> 01:33:24.547
And I believe that.

01:33:24.965 --> 01:33:26.382
It's over!

01:33:28.885 --> 01:33:30.177
Max?

01:33:30.887 --> 01:33:33.639
I've gotta head down
to ABT now.

01:33:33.723 --> 01:33:36.767
I've got the Swan Lake
benefit tonight, okay?

01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:42.148
But when I come back, we can maybe
celebrate Malkovich's big four-four.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.525
Okay?

01:33:45.235 --> 01:33:49.113
Jesus! Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

01:33:49.197 --> 01:33:52.575
What if I... What if I
fall tonight and break my hip?

01:34:43.585 --> 01:34:45.461
Like that, little girl?

01:34:46.963 --> 01:34:48.505
Huh, lamb?

01:34:50.842 --> 01:34:52.218
I love you.

01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:28.295
Bravo!

01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:36.845
Maxine?

01:35:44.396 --> 01:35:45.688
Ma...

01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:58.617
Hello? Hello?

01:35:58.702 --> 01:36:00.119
We have Maxine.

01:36:00.203 --> 01:36:03.622
Oh! My God.
Please, please, don't hurt her.

01:36:03.707 --> 01:36:07.167
Listen, I'll... I'll give you
anything you want. Please.

01:36:07.252 --> 01:36:09.795
You listen to me, asshole.
I don't want your fucking money.

01:36:09.879 --> 01:36:13.173
What I want is for you
to leave John Malkovich now!

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.968
Who... Who is this, Lester?

01:36:16.052 --> 01:36:17.136
Does it matter?

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.055
We're gonna kill Maxine if you
don't leave the body immediately!

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:24.810
But I-I-I can't do that.
I mean, if-if I leave Malkovich,

01:36:24.894 --> 01:36:28.522
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.
No career, no money.

01:36:28.606 --> 01:36:29.940
Maxine will have
nothing to do...

01:36:30.025 --> 01:36:32.151
She barely has anything
to do with me now.

01:36:32.235 --> 01:36:35.654
Jesus, we're going to kill your
wife, you fucking lunatic!

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.407
God.

01:36:38.491 --> 01:36:40.826
Listen, Schwartz,
Malkovich is our vessel.

01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:44.913
We're old. We're going to die if
we don't get into him by midni...

01:37:00.555 --> 01:37:02.389
He called our bluff.

01:37:04.601 --> 01:37:05.934
Shit!

01:37:06.519 --> 01:37:09.897
Can't we just go inside the
portal and push Craig out?

01:37:09.981 --> 01:37:11.857
No, he's much too powerful.

01:37:11.941 --> 01:37:15.778
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.

01:37:40.261 --> 01:37:41.637
Lotte.

01:37:44.849 --> 01:37:47.226
If I can't have you,
no one will.

01:37:50.647 --> 01:37:52.815
Lotte, no!

01:37:53.483 --> 01:37:56.360
No, Lotte! God, no,
we can't really kill her!

01:37:56.444 --> 01:38:00.114
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
Our next vessel!

01:38:08.081 --> 01:38:10.082
Hey! Help me!

01:38:11.126 --> 01:38:12.543
Help me!

01:38:13.878 --> 01:38:15.421
Where the fuck am I?

01:38:15.505 --> 01:38:17.965
We're in
Malkovich's subconscious.

01:38:18.466 --> 01:38:20.634
The last thing
you'll ever see, Maxine.

01:38:23.346 --> 01:38:24.930
Fag-o-vitch!

01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:27.391
Johnny, baby, Johnny.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:38.318
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

01:38:38.403 --> 01:38:40.279
I am bad. I am bad.

01:38:40.363 --> 01:38:43.198
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

01:38:43.867 --> 01:38:46.201
I am bad. I am bad. I am bad.

01:38:57.547 --> 01:39:00.007
Maxine, I am gonna kill you!

01:39:04.053 --> 01:39:05.846
You're creepy.

01:39:16.608 --> 01:39:21.236
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!

01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:24.281
Wet his pants
so all could see!

01:39:24.365 --> 01:39:29.203
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!
Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.165
Wet his pants
so all could see!

01:39:47.305 --> 01:39:49.264
I loved you so much!

01:39:51.017 --> 01:39:54.186
Oh! Why did you have to
hurt me like that?

01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:56.188
I'm sorry, Lotte.

01:39:56.481 --> 01:40:00.484
I guess I loved you, too,
in my way.

01:40:01.069 --> 01:40:04.947
You are so full of shit,
Maxine!

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.782
I know.

01:40:07.951 --> 01:40:09.284
I know!

01:40:13.915 --> 01:40:15.749
It's your baby, okay?

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.460
What?

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.797
The baby, it's yours.

01:40:23.007 --> 01:40:26.385
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.

01:40:26.469 --> 01:40:29.096
You cannot fuck with me
anymore, Maxine!

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:30.514
I'm not!

01:40:31.474 --> 01:40:34.476
I kept it because I knew
you were the father,

01:40:37.272 --> 01:40:40.232
the other mother, whatever,
because I...

01:40:40.316 --> 01:40:42.317
Because it was yours.

01:40:44.988 --> 01:40:47.030
So we're parents?

01:40:48.992 --> 01:40:50.325
Together?

01:40:52.412 --> 01:40:53.704
Yeah.

01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:16.602
Say, uh,
aren't you John Malkovich?

01:41:17.186 --> 01:41:18.979
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

01:41:19.063 --> 01:41:20.188
No.

01:41:20.523 --> 01:41:22.608
I can't believe
you're in this shithole, man.

01:41:22.692 --> 01:41:24.943
You guys know
this is John Malkovich?

01:41:25.028 --> 01:41:26.320
I'm not John Malkovich.

01:41:26.404 --> 01:41:27.946
This is John Malkovich...

01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:30.490
I am not John Malkovich!

01:41:30.575 --> 01:41:32.993
Cut it out, you guys.

01:41:47.383 --> 01:41:49.384
- Yes?
- Lester, please don't do it.

01:41:49.469 --> 01:41:51.094
Please don't kill Maxine.

01:41:51.179 --> 01:41:52.220
So you'll leave?

01:41:52.305 --> 01:41:54.473
Yes, I said...
I, uh... I am leaving.

01:41:54.557 --> 01:41:58.268
All right. Do it now while I'm
on the phone so I can hear

01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:00.312
and your lovely bride walks.

01:42:00.396 --> 01:42:03.106
Uh... Okay. Okay.

01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:05.567
I'm going.

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.996
Now, my friends.
The time is now.

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:52.280
I'm free.

01:42:56.077 --> 01:42:57.953
I'm back! I'm...

01:43:14.595 --> 01:43:15.804
Lotte.

01:43:47.962 --> 01:43:49.171
Ooh!

01:43:53.009 --> 01:43:55.510
Hello. Hello, young lady.
We're...

01:43:56.804 --> 01:43:58.638
Malk...

01:43:58.723 --> 01:44:01.057
We're Malkovich.

01:44:02.185 --> 01:44:04.060
Hey! Hey!

01:44:04.145 --> 01:44:06.354
Maxine!
I did it, Maxine!

01:44:06.689 --> 01:44:08.607
I left Malkovich for you,
sweetie!

01:44:08.691 --> 01:44:10.901
It's no good being Malkovich
without you.

01:44:10.985 --> 01:44:12.277
It proves I love you!

01:44:12.361 --> 01:44:13.570
- Fuck off, Craig!
- Doesn't it?

01:44:13.654 --> 01:44:15.822
He's not with us.

01:44:25.333 --> 01:44:27.793
Maxine, I love you!

01:44:28.294 --> 01:44:29.961
I'm gonna go right back
into Malkovich

01:44:30.046 --> 01:44:31.338
and I'm gonna kick Lester out!

01:44:31.422 --> 01:44:33.131
And then you'll love me again!

01:44:33.216 --> 01:44:35.884
Maxine! Maxine!

01:44:50.107 --> 01:44:51.566
Ma-Sheen.

01:44:51.651 --> 01:44:55.320
Hey. Malcatraz.
Uh, how are you?

01:44:55.404 --> 01:44:57.739
- I'm very well. And you?
- Good, good.

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.157
- You look well.
- Thank you.

01:44:59.242 --> 01:45:01.868
- How's Celeste?
- She's good, yeah.

01:45:01.953 --> 01:45:04.162
She's sorry she couldn't make it today.
She had to go to the store.

01:45:04.247 --> 01:45:05.580
Oh, that's okay.

01:45:05.665 --> 01:45:06.832
Charlie, hi!

01:45:06.916 --> 01:45:08.291
I didn't even hear the door.

01:45:08.376 --> 01:45:10.126
Lookin' great, Flo.

01:45:10.211 --> 01:45:12.337
I'm looking grateful?

01:45:14.465 --> 01:45:17.342
Charlie, we are not
getting any younger.

01:45:17.802 --> 01:45:19.761
Well, don't rub it in.

01:45:20.096 --> 01:45:22.764
Listen, Charlie, I know this
is going to sound crazy,

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:25.350
but what would you think
if I told you

01:45:25.434 --> 01:45:29.604
that I'd found a way for us
to live forever? All of us.

01:45:30.982 --> 01:45:32.607
Johnny boy,
what are you talking about?

01:45:32.692 --> 01:45:36.611
All of us. Celeste, Floris, you, me.
Gary Sinise maybe.

01:45:39.323 --> 01:45:41.575
I don't really understand.

01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:52.294
Charlie, this is Emily.

01:46:02.555 --> 01:46:04.306
Isn't she lovely?

01:46:05.975 --> 01:46:08.101
- Hey, pass the Cheetos.
- You need more puffs?

01:46:08.185 --> 01:46:09.477
No, I want more.

01:46:09.562 --> 01:46:11.521
Okeydoke.
They're covered in grease.

01:46:11.606 --> 01:46:12.647
Shut up.

01:46:12.732 --> 01:46:14.482
Can I swim yet?

01:46:14.650 --> 01:46:17.277
- Can you swim yet?
- What time is it?

01:46:17.653 --> 01:46:19.070
Shall we do the cramp test?

01:46:19.155 --> 01:46:20.697
Check her.

01:46:22.199 --> 01:46:24.868
Let me see. Are you gonna throw up?
Let me see!

01:46:25.578 --> 01:46:28.330
Are you gonna throw up?
Are you gonna vomit?

01:46:28.873 --> 01:46:30.916
Okay, you can swim.

01:46:34.837 --> 01:46:36.588
Maxine.

01:46:37.423 --> 01:46:38.882
Maxine.

01:46:40.009 --> 01:46:41.885
I love you, Maxine.

01:46:43.846 --> 01:46:45.680
Oh, look away.

01:46:46.349 --> 01:46:48.183
Look away.

01:46:48.517 --> 01:46:51.561
Look away. Look away.

01:46:51.729 --> 01:46:54.522
Look away. Look away.

01:46:55.107 --> 01:46:56.650
Look away.
