Did they say if they have kids?

01:04.708 --> 01:06.041
I didn't ask.

01:06.708 --> 01:07.708
Shit!

01:09.166 --> 01:11.000
Will, what is this?

01:12.583 --> 01:14.166
Ehh, it's probably a rat.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.625
Whatever it is, it's long gone.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.958
The pool's a fucking mess.
Looks like a swamp.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.125
- Stop.
- What's wrong?

01:38.791 --> 01:42.958
You know, you used to love
to fool around in the nice ones.

01:44.791 --> 01:46.625
Is this one above my pay grade?

01:53.416 --> 01:55.125
I'm in the middle
of a dark tunnel,

01:55.125 --> 01:57.166
and my car dies on me.

01:57.791 --> 02:02.500
So, I'm sitting there alone
and looking for a flashlight,

02:02.500 --> 02:04.958
but then I hear a train coming towards me,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.250
but I can't see it.

02:06.250 --> 02:10.583
So, I started feeling for the keys to turn
the battery on and flash the lights,

02:11.083 --> 02:12.208
but they were gone.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.333
And I could hear the train
speeding towards me,

02:15.333 --> 02:18.416
and I went to get out, but I couldn't.

02:18.916 --> 02:21.791
- I couldn't move. I just froze.
- And then what?

02:22.458 --> 02:25.333
That's it.
What do you think it means?

02:26.791 --> 02:28.708
Maybe you're afraid
of getting caught.

<i>Hi.
This is Summer Elswick of Grady Real--</i>

02:50.250 --> 02:53.041
What's the secret to survival?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.375
And how did we survive
when so many others didn't?

02:56.375 --> 02:59.333
- Mm-hm?
- I'll tell you the secret.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.083
But first, I'm going to need you
to do something for me.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.291
- I hate the beard.
- Of course you do.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.250
It just doesn't look good.

03:10.416 --> 03:13.625
I need you to take everything
you know about your business,

03:14.125 --> 03:15.125
set it aside.

03:16.416 --> 03:17.375
Good. Again.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.791
Advertising?

03:19.416 --> 03:20.541
Set it aside.

03:21.375 --> 03:25.000
We say to ourselves,
when it takes six months to find a buyer,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.458
"Oh, well, it must have been
a marketing problem,"

03:27.458 --> 03:30.875
but it is not a marketing problem.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.333
The problem

03:35.250 --> 03:36.500
is us.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.916
As a matter of fact,

03:38.916 --> 03:42.291
there's a lot of... [whispers] ...<i>assholes</i>
in this business.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.666
And the good news
is that <i>that</i> is good news for you.

03:48.666 --> 03:51.875
I never wanted
to be the one to show places.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.166
Made me too nervous.

03:53.166 --> 03:57.916
So Bill, Will's father,
God rest his soul, uh, insisted.

03:57.916 --> 04:01.250
He says, "Camille, you've got to."
Remember that, honey?

04:01.250 --> 04:02.500
Thank you, dear.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.500
Uh, so anyway, there was
this fellow standing outside...

04:33.791 --> 04:35.333
Where the fuck were you?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.541
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

04:41.541 --> 04:44.000
You know how much this meant to me.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.208
And where were you?

04:47.416 --> 04:48.541
You fell asleep?

04:49.208 --> 04:50.125
It's fine.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.291
Hello? This is Summer.

05:53.416 --> 05:56.125
- Okay, listen, I gotta go.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.875
-  Making moves.
- Hey, man.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.250
Sorry. It was a crazy day.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.458
These foreclosures are a steal.

06:03.625 --> 06:07.625

-  <i>Hi, this is Summer...</i>

07:07.250 --> 07:08.875

-  Men.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.500

08:33.500 --> 08:36.166

Hey.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.458
- Fashionably late.
- No, Wally, we started late.

08:40.458 --> 08:42.708
-  What happened?
-  Cut myself.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.375
Kitchen accident.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.916
- Six stitches, right there.
- Bullshit. Judy stabbed him.

08:51.541 --> 08:52.916
You deserved it.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.041
-  Look at them.

Hey, they're calling.

-  ...traveling for two weeks.
- See anything you like, Vic?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.458
- I can't fucking read this.
- I got you, baby.

09:03.458 --> 09:06.500
I'm gonna have the escargot...

09:06.500 --> 09:09.250
Hey, Wally. I knew Oklahoma
could boot scoot,

09:09.250 --> 09:11.416
but I didn't know
he could speak French.

09:11.416 --> 09:14.708
Judy, here we go. Malta, Croatia.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.916
- Oh yes.
-  We end in Scarborough Castle...

09:16.916 --> 09:20.166
- I'll take the spaghetti, please.
- No, give him the duck.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.833
-  I'll take the duck.
- Good boy.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.791
-  It's supposed to be haunted.
-  Are you afraid?

09:26.791 --> 09:29.541
-  No, I'm excited.
- Now, look at Allen's face.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.458
That's the face of a man who's about
to spend more money on one dinner

09:33.458 --> 09:35.791
for four guys he doesn't even like,

09:35.791 --> 09:40.000
than he has on Deena, his kids,
birthdays, Christmas, vacations...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.791
- Did I miss anything else?
-  No, you got everything.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.458
-  Excuse me.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.416
Gotta get this. Excuse me.

09:46.416 --> 09:47.833
That's the bank!

09:49.333 --> 09:52.666
- Tell 'em the Jesse James story.
- Come on, you do it better than I do.

09:52.666 --> 09:53.958
Tell 'em! Tell 'em.

09:58.291 --> 10:02.958
Once upon a time,
Jesse James and his gang robbed a train.

10:02.958 --> 10:05.125
And he held everyone at gunpoint.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.666
He says, "All right,

10:07.333 --> 10:11.291
give us all your money or we kill
the women and rape all the men."

10:11.958 --> 10:15.791
One of the guys with his hands up says,
"I'm sorry, don't you mean

10:15.791 --> 10:18.458
kill the men and rape all the women?"

10:18.458 --> 10:21.375
And then a gay guy in the back says,

10:22.125 --> 10:25.666
"Excuse me, I think Mr. James
knows how to rob a train."

10:29.666 --> 10:33.291
-  More wine? Anyone? Anyone?
-  We need more.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.833
Tell us about this trip.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.708
-  It's two weeks.

10:36.708 --> 10:39.791
We end up at this castle
in Scarborough, England.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.833
It's supposed to be haunted.
We stay there for three nights.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.458
-  He's not gonna like that.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.916
He doesn't know
it's supposed to be haunted.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.875
<i>Standby 7-2, West 21st Street, #3.</i>

10:52.833 --> 10:54.291
Can you keep a secret?

10:57.041 --> 10:58.041
Sure.

10:59.958 --> 11:00.958
I'm sick.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.333
What do you mean?

11:09.291 --> 11:10.708
I got MS.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.416
I just found out last week.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.083
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die on you.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.375
Jesus Christ.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.708
Get those people across the street.
And no press.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.208
I don't want anyone talking to them.
Cleary, what do we got?

11:43.208 --> 11:44.833
We got a dead realtor.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.916
- You already pull the case number?
-  Yeah. 19H-012.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.500
...and the eaves above the attic.

11:57.916 --> 12:01.333
Lot of nooks and crannies in a place
like this. You've been all over, right?

12:01.333 --> 12:04.541
Is there any back staircase?
That kind of stuff?

12:04.541 --> 12:07.625
Uh-huh? Look in the basement?
What's in the basement?

12:08.291 --> 12:09.250
Uh-huh?

12:09.250 --> 12:12.125
Look in the backyard.
There's sheds and things out there.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.625
I need you to look very carefully
in those kind of places.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.750
So the killer forgot something.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.416
She was stabbed so hard
it got jammed in her pelvis.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.375
Oh.

13:03.875 --> 13:04.875
That's mine.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.000
What's your name, man?

13:09.500 --> 13:10.666
Um, Joe.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.041
Joe, when you walk through that door,

13:16.041 --> 13:17.958
there's a jury of 12 watching you.

13:19.041 --> 13:20.083
You understand?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.041
Yes, sir.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.000
I heard a car pull up.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.416
And I looked up and saw a man
walking towards the front door.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.125
Hang on, Brenda. Where were you?

13:34.125 --> 13:36.125
I was in that house right there.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.583
I was outside smoking a cigarette.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.083
Do you live there?

13:40.083 --> 13:41.666
No, I'm the caregiver there.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.625
So you hear the car pull up,

13:45.333 --> 13:47.000
you look this way,

13:47.000 --> 13:48.333
then what happened?

13:48.916 --> 13:51.041
I saw a man walk into the house.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.458
-  Just do your job!
- You ever seen that man before?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.208
-  Settle down.
-  No.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.000
- About how old do you think he was?
-  I don't know.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.208
- What'd he look like?
-  I couldn't tell.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.291
He was wearing a hoodie.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.125
I'll tell you what though.
He walked sort of funny.

14:05.125 --> 14:08.083
- What do you mean?
-  Like he had a limp.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.416
Hi, Will.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.083
Tom. Scarborough Homicide.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.666
Everything is being recorded.

14:53.750 --> 14:58.250
Before we start, I wanna say that
I'm very sorry about what happened, Will.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.666
How long were you and Summer together?

15:04.625 --> 15:06.125
About a year and a half.

15:10.666 --> 15:13.291
How would you describe your relationship?

15:14.416 --> 15:15.375
Normal.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.333
Uh...

15:17.958 --> 15:19.375
Ups and downs.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.458
Like any relationship, I guess.

15:23.791 --> 15:24.666
Hm.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.125
When was the last time you saw her?

15:28.833 --> 15:30.583
Uh, I saw her this morning.

15:31.708 --> 15:34.041
Did you notice anything strange about her?

15:35.875 --> 15:36.875
No.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.666
Well, we... had an argument

15:41.916 --> 15:42.750
last night.

15:43.833 --> 15:44.833
What about?

15:46.958 --> 15:49.583
Doesn't even matter now. I had this thing.

15:50.666 --> 15:52.833
Um, she never showed up.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.625
Do you know
who she was meeting at the house?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.541
I don't know.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.250
I don't know their name. She...

16:03.958 --> 16:05.375
She never told me.

16:05.375 --> 16:06.625
Huh.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.875
I was going to marry her.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.208
I told my mom.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.583
The day I met her.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.500
I said...

16:25.458 --> 16:27.125
I said, "I'm going to marry her."

16:27.708 --> 16:28.833
Why didn't you?

16:28.833 --> 16:31.916
Well, she's technically still married.

16:36.875 --> 16:40.125
I know that sounds weird,
but they were separated.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.416
What's her husband's name?

16:45.750 --> 16:46.833
Sam Gifford.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.083
Will, would you be willing to take
a polygraph down the road?

16:56.208 --> 16:57.208
Yeah.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.625
Good.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.208
Open.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.291
Lift your arm.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.375
What about the poly?

17:18.541 --> 17:20.333
Good luck with that.

17:20.333 --> 17:23.250
Come on, I just want to hook him up to it,
see what he says.

17:23.750 --> 17:27.000
- You don't even have to plug it in.
- You guys did that in Philly?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.000
From time to time, yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.333
Not against the law.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.375
He's got no scratches, nothing under
his nails, no signs of struggle.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.333
Tom, let him go home.
He's cooperating with us.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.083
All we got is a grandmother in Milwaukee
we're trying to get ahold of.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.583
Did we find her phone yet?

17:41.583 --> 17:44.916
No, but we got a ping order.
We've been calling. Nothing.

17:46.708 --> 17:47.625
Okay.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Hi.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.208
What happened?

18:27.666 --> 18:28.875
They fucked up.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.041
I see.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.291
- Hi, Peter.
-  Hey, Tom.

18:34.291 --> 18:37.208
Uh, our bad.

18:37.208 --> 18:41.416
We made a mistake, but, uh, don't worry.
It's going to come out of our end.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.833
We'll, uh, get it fixed.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.125
You think Nichols
should be our lead?

18:51.125 --> 18:52.458
Yeah. Why?

18:53.750 --> 18:56.041
His past may bring
the wrong kind of attention.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.250
He doesn't have a past. He's clean.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.791
If anything, he's got
more experience handling homicide

19:00.791 --> 19:02.875
than anyone in our department.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.583
Okay.

19:08.833 --> 19:09.916
Good morning.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.750
I'm Chief Marty Graeber.
This is Captain Robert Allen.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.500
<i>We're here to talk about
the murder that occurred last evening.</i>

19:16.500 --> 19:19.500
<i>I do want to remind you all
this is an ongoing investigation,</i>

19:19.500 --> 19:22.291
<i>so there's not going to be
a lot of we can talk about,</i>

19:22.291 --> 19:24.583
<i>but we'll do the best we can.</i>

19:25.250 --> 19:26.833
<i>But I do want to emphasize that</i>

19:26.833 --> 19:29.708
<i>our detectives have been
working through the night.</i>

19:29.708 --> 19:32.958
<i>They will not rest
until we find out who did this.</i>

19:32.958 --> 19:34.583
<i>I want to make that very clear.</i>

19:36.041 --> 19:38.875
<i>Our men and women are
some of the best in law enforcement</i>

19:38.875 --> 19:40.166
<i>anywhere in the country.</i>

19:41.166 --> 19:43.666
<i>- So with that...</i>
-  I just wanna air it out.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.041
I love you.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.125
Heard of knives getting stuck before.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.875
First time I've ever seen it.

19:54.666 --> 19:58.333
We had to cut into the bone
and pull it out. That's how hard it hit.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.416
Thirty-three and a half
stab wounds in total.

20:01.416 --> 20:05.083
Semen in her vaginal cavity,
wrists were bound by rope.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.291
Checked with the lab,
there weren't any fingerprints anywhere.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.875
No bruises sustained below the waist.
No sign of forced sexual contact.

20:12.875 --> 20:16.541
Well, we still can't rule out rape, home?

20:16.541 --> 20:18.333
No, that's right.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.416
We can't.

20:20.875 --> 20:25.666
We also recovered blond hair
that doesn't belong to the victim.

20:26.666 --> 20:27.750
Let me see that.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.166
Can I show you something strange?

20:36.208 --> 20:39.916
See this on the edge of her left palm?
It's not blood.

20:40.416 --> 20:41.708
It's paint.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.958
It's called calcimine.

20:43.958 --> 20:46.750
They used it in old houses.
They don't make it anymore.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.916
Found traces of it in the rug.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.291
What are these from?

20:53.791 --> 20:55.625
Bruises. Probably a defensive wound.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.625
What happened to your hand?

21:07.208 --> 21:08.500
Kitchen accident.

21:12.125 --> 21:15.208
-  Fuck me.
- What is it? Dark blue? Purple?

21:15.208 --> 21:17.041
What color
did the neighbor say it was?

21:17.041 --> 21:18.625
The neighbor never saw the car.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.625
This is the only angle we got?

21:20.625 --> 21:21.750
Yeah.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.833
It's a Buick LeSabre.

21:26.166 --> 21:29.375
Yep. Buick LeSabre, 1990.

21:29.375 --> 21:33.166
Excuse me, sir. Zoom in.
Is it missing a hubcap?

21:38.791 --> 21:40.000
Right there, huh?

21:41.041 --> 21:42.375
It's a good catch.

22:06.541 --> 22:07.541
Who is that?

22:09.208 --> 22:11.000
Summer and her ex-husband.

22:13.916 --> 22:14.875
Uh-huh.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.333
Can I borrow this?

22:17.750 --> 22:21.083
Sure, take whatever you want.
I can't stay here.

22:21.625 --> 22:22.833
I understand.

22:27.375 --> 22:28.541
You mind?

22:30.375 --> 22:31.375
No.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.125
She had only one computer?

23:02.166 --> 23:05.791
Uh, yeah, just the laptop.
She always took it with her.

23:09.458 --> 23:10.541
Mr. Grady.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.833
Do you know if Summer had life insurance?

23:15.333 --> 23:16.791
No, I don't know.

23:16.791 --> 23:17.875
Okay.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.833
It's easy to find out.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.916
Thank you.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.250
I love this kitchen.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.875
<i>521, switch to channel six.</i>

24:08.083 --> 24:11.916
<i>All units, all units,
we have a robbery in progress at 108...</i>

24:38.125 --> 24:39.750
Yeah. I don't know him.

24:39.750 --> 24:40.833
Okay.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.708
Do you know
if she had any secret admirers?

24:46.666 --> 24:47.500
No.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.125
She's got no life insurance.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.000
Check this out.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.833
-  What am I watching?
- Sam Gifford. The ex-husband.

25:13.833 --> 25:16.291
He's on file for a bunch of dope stuff.

25:17.666 --> 25:20.416
Apparently he collects
human hair for his art.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.333
He ain't afraid.

25:25.708 --> 25:27.875
A beauty school dropout, huh?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.375
Excuse me.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.666
Oh.

25:55.666 --> 25:57.333
Hey. Sorry.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.458
Afternoon.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.333
We're with the Scarborough
Police Department.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.375
And we're looking for Sam Gifford.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.000
Okay. That's me.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.625
We'd like to talk to you
about Summer Elswick.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.166
Do you mind if we talk up front?

26:21.750 --> 26:22.750
Is she okay?

26:23.666 --> 26:26.750
Well, uh... not really.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.208
What happened?

26:30.208 --> 26:32.791
She was attacked by someone
and she was stabbed.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.250
Is she dead?

26:41.250 --> 26:42.208
Yeah.

26:44.958 --> 26:46.166
I'm sorry, Sam.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.458
I'd like to ask you some questions.

26:52.916 --> 26:53.958
Okay?

26:53.958 --> 26:54.875
Yeah.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.791
When was the last time you saw her?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.333
Couple of months ago.

27:03.583 --> 27:04.916
Where were you Saturday?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.958
Uh, I was, uh...

27:07.958 --> 27:08.875
...fishing.

27:08.875 --> 27:12.125
- Fishing up north near Jackson Lake.
- And who'd you go with?

27:13.250 --> 27:14.375
I went alone.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.041
- Like what time?
-  Maybe, um...

27:19.041 --> 27:20.041
nine a.m.?

27:20.541 --> 27:22.083
What time d'you get back?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.708
I got home last night.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.375
- Is that your truck?
-  Yeah, it is.

27:28.375 --> 27:30.000
Did you drive up in it?

27:30.833 --> 27:32.541
- I did.
-  Okay.

27:33.583 --> 27:35.083
What's that on your hand?

27:37.625 --> 27:38.791
- It's paint.
-  Oh yeah?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.708
Can I... Mind if I see it?

27:40.708 --> 27:42.000
Am I a suspect?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.500
Well, Mr. Gifford, right now everyone
is a suspect. You understand.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.375
- We're just trying to do our job.
- Yeah, I understand.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.291
Um, if you guys aren't going to
read me my rights, we're done here.

27:51.291 --> 27:53.291
And if you are,
I want a lawyer. Thank you.

27:53.291 --> 27:54.208
Wait!

27:54.208 --> 27:57.208
- We're just trying to gather information.
-  Have a nice day.

28:06.458 --> 28:10.333
William, Oklahoma, Mary, 755.

28:10.333 --> 28:13.833
I need all the LPR northbound
and southbound on I-35.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.125
Yeah. You got it buddy. Thank you.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.541
By the way,
why does Wally call you Oklahoma?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.041
'Cause I can cut a rug, baby.

28:25.666 --> 28:28.666
Sides face, grand square.

28:31.208 --> 28:34.166
50% of female victims
are killed by their exes.

28:35.916 --> 28:37.750
Four ladies chain.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.000
Promenade.

28:44.625 --> 28:48.041
Multiple stab wounds?
I mean, that's a crime of passion.

28:48.041 --> 28:51.000
And if the husband's a drug user,
you can bump that up to 90%.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.625
- Baby, I'm concentrating.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.250
Allemande left,
and a right-and-left grand.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.500
Keep the corner.

29:05.666 --> 29:08.125
There you go. There you go.

29:08.125 --> 29:11.208
-  Wally, what are you giving us?
- He's promoting himself.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.208
- Here you go.
-  His side business.

29:13.208 --> 29:14.625
It even has a logo.

29:14.625 --> 29:16.875
Now, please tell your uncle,
it's called capitalism.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.333
And he could learn a thing or two.

29:18.333 --> 29:21.458
What is this,
"Active Duty Security Consulting"?

29:21.458 --> 29:22.833
What's up with the bulldog?

29:22.833 --> 29:26.083
Because when we bite, we never let go.

29:28.958 --> 29:30.375
Come on, Wally, be honest.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.750
This ain't your logo.
This is definitely your mugshot.

29:34.625 --> 29:37.208
Did you hear that?
At least they got my good side.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.250
Do you have to be
walked twice a day?

29:42.958 --> 29:45.250
How long have you been with your lady?

29:46.083 --> 29:48.833
Too long. Six years.

29:49.666 --> 29:51.083
Why don't you marry her?

29:51.875 --> 29:53.000
No fucking way.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.708
How old are you, man?

29:57.958 --> 29:58.958
Forty-five.

29:59.791 --> 30:02.250
Coming up to that big five-oh.

30:02.250 --> 30:04.500
You don't want to end up old and alone.

30:05.166 --> 30:06.791
That's a real bitch.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.708
I came into this world alone,

30:10.708 --> 30:12.416
I'll go through it alone,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.625
and I'm going to die alone.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.333
So fuck it.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.583
Okay, tough guy.

30:20.833 --> 30:24.333
She sold half a dozen houses,
no commissions.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.833
That'd piss me off.

30:41.625 --> 30:44.041
According to her records,

30:44.041 --> 30:47.166
she didn't get commissions
on six of her sales.

30:47.875 --> 30:49.208
Is that right?

30:49.208 --> 30:53.041
Well, it's... it's a little more
complicated than that.

30:53.041 --> 30:56.458
Her commissions went into
the purchase of an investment property.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.875
That way she didn't have to pay taxes.

30:58.875 --> 31:00.875
It's a townhouse on McKinley.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.625
About how much money we talking about?

31:03.208 --> 31:05.958
Uh, I think about 70 grand.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.208
We don't touch it.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.666
It goes to the family.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.208
Who owns 1502 Whitcomb, by the way?

31:13.458 --> 31:14.583
I own it.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.666
That's good to know.
One less phone call we have to make.

31:24.875 --> 31:25.833
<i>Seventy grand.</i>

31:26.875 --> 31:28.500
She never got a divorce.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.333
That's a motive for the ex.

31:31.458 --> 31:32.291
Maybe.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.375
-  Let's see it.
-  Eighteen grand.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.625
Oh, that's a lot of money.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.875
It's an investment
if we ever want to sell it, but...

31:38.875 --> 31:41.250
That's awful. Who would do that?

31:42.250 --> 31:45.166
In Philly, when Tommy's partner
was being investigated,

31:45.166 --> 31:47.375
we were dealing with
all kinds of crazy shit.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.583
<i>Tommy was sleeping
with a gun under his pillow.</i>

31:49.583 --> 31:51.708
<i>I was convinced
he was gonna blow my tits off.</i>

31:51.708 --> 31:55.416
- Where's my money?
<i>- </i>  Jesus Christ! What the fuck?

31:55.416 --> 31:59.208
The cops under investigation
thought Tommy was gonna talk.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.250
They used to carve,
like with a rock or something,

32:01.250 --> 32:04.750
they used to carve this shit
into the windshield of my car,

32:04.750 --> 32:07.833
like, "Cheese-eater.
Admit the rat in you."

32:07.833 --> 32:09.208
That must have been hell.

32:09.208 --> 32:12.041
Ugh, you have no idea.
That's why we had to leave.

32:12.041 --> 32:15.458
-  It's Paul's birthday. Sign it.
- Jesus. You're fucking crazy.

32:15.458 --> 32:18.000
He's gonna love it.
Not the right tit. That's for Allen.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.541
Tommy was so depressed
he wouldn't come out of the bedroom.

32:20.541 --> 32:22.291
It knocked the life out of us.

32:22.916 --> 32:23.750
Never again.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.875
<i>If it wasn't for my uncle and Deena,
who knows where we'd be.</i>

32:26.875 --> 32:28.958
So how's Mr. Detective Cleary doing?

32:28.958 --> 32:34.541
Well, aside from never wearing a tie...
he's doing pretty good.

32:34.541 --> 32:37.708
Good. Because I taught him
everything he knows.

32:37.708 --> 32:40.708
Not everything I know.
Everything <i>he</i> knows.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.500
<i>Oh, man, those eggs are good...</i>

32:46.500 --> 32:48.708
Uncle Allen had a scare.

32:49.875 --> 32:50.875
What do you mean?

32:51.875 --> 32:54.791
He was in the hot tub
and he couldn't get out. He couldn't move.

32:54.791 --> 32:57.291
Deena had to pull him out all by herself.

32:57.791 --> 32:58.958
How is he now?

32:58.958 --> 32:59.875
He's fine.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.000
- Deena should've called us.
- I know.

33:08.750 --> 33:12.708
She's worried that
it's only going to get worse now.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.958
Jesus Christ.

33:24.875 --> 33:25.750
Yes?

33:25.750 --> 33:27.125
Yes, sorry to bother you.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.916
I think I accidentally got
some of your mail.

33:31.791 --> 33:32.750
Thank you.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.500
Oh wait, that's... This is mine.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.791
I don't... This one was open already.

33:40.958 --> 33:42.875
This is mine, that's yours.

33:43.708 --> 33:47.041
That's yours. That's yours.
All the rest are yours.

33:47.041 --> 33:48.833
Okay. All right, thank you.

33:49.625 --> 33:50.958
You don't remember me?

33:54.375 --> 33:55.416
No, I'm sorry.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.250
Well, I guess, uh...

33:58.000 --> 34:01.208
I wouldn't remember me either.
You know, if I were you.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.166
Is your mother home?
Your mother would remember me.

34:09.375 --> 34:12.083
I just wanted to give you
my condolences. That's it.

34:16.541 --> 34:18.666
- Move your fucking foot!
- No problem.

34:24.500 --> 34:25.583
What the fuck?

34:29.708 --> 34:33.958
<i>Her phone pinged in Limerick
at 19:40 the night before she was killed.</i>

34:33.958 --> 34:37.583
-  Where the fuck is Limerick?
- About 45 minutes east.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.166
She sold a property there.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.166
Why would she go back?

34:53.375 --> 34:54.500
To show it.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.458
No.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.708
She sold it 14 months ago.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.375
Can I help you?

36:33.666 --> 36:35.708
And, uh, who's been painting it?

36:36.583 --> 36:41.000
Church members volunteer.
I'm the caretaker. I just watch the place.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.583
Okay.

36:43.708 --> 36:44.625
So...

36:46.708 --> 36:48.208
have you seen her before?

36:50.916 --> 36:52.625
I... I don't recognize her.

36:53.125 --> 36:54.583
- No?
- Mm-mm.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.750
How about that car?

37:02.750 --> 37:04.958
No, I haven't seen it.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.166
Okay, well, one more.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.208
How about this gentleman?

37:14.791 --> 37:17.458
No, I haven't seen him.

37:18.375 --> 37:22.833
- Okay, well... oh for three.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.833
At least we know
where the paint came from.

37:25.833 --> 37:28.875
<i>Yeah.
And the hair came back. It's a wig.</i>

37:28.875 --> 37:30.708
What about the number
that called her?

37:30.708 --> 37:33.958
<i>It's a burner.
It only dialed one number. Summer's.</i>

37:33.958 --> 37:36.083
<i>It was activated
the day before the murder.</i>

37:36.083 --> 37:38.000
<i>The day she received the initial call.</i>

37:38.000 --> 37:41.666
<i>It was used to make six calls to Summer.
After the murder, nothing.</i>

37:42.958 --> 37:44.958
Get me the video from the store.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.208
<i>Yeah, we tried.</i>

37:46.208 --> 37:47.916
<i>They wiped it.</i>

37:47.916 --> 37:50.666
Oh great. So we got a wig and shit.

37:51.208 --> 37:54.208
<i>I'd call that grape purple.</i>

37:54.208 --> 37:56.958
Okay. We got a purple Buick.

37:56.958 --> 37:58.583
It's not a Buick.

37:58.583 --> 38:03.000
This is the car I drove in college.
It's a Chrysler Imperial from the '90s.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.458
You see that slit right there?
That's a window.

38:05.458 --> 38:08.333
My dad got me one.
Everyone thought I was a narc.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.000
Here, let me show you.

38:11.958 --> 38:14.458
Is that the car
you lost your virginity in?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.958
- No. It was a different car.
-  Hm.

38:18.958 --> 38:21.458
- And it was in high school.
- Oh, that's right.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.666
You were 14. That's gross.

38:23.666 --> 38:24.958
You're gross.

38:24.958 --> 38:27.750
You lost your virginity to a prostitute.

38:28.250 --> 38:31.291
Look, you see the eyelids
right there on the headlights?

38:31.291 --> 38:32.375
They open and close.

38:32.375 --> 38:35.750
- Oh. Unknown caller.

38:36.583 --> 38:38.500
Who could that be? Your hooker?

38:39.750 --> 38:40.916
Hello?

38:42.583 --> 38:44.666
You got this August 26th?

38:44.666 --> 38:46.500
Uh, let me check the invoice.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.041
No. Received May 26th.

38:50.541 --> 38:52.291
Is this the original paint?

38:52.291 --> 38:54.458
Uh, yes, it is. Factory paint.

38:57.083 --> 38:58.750
Okay, thank you.

38:58.750 --> 39:01.208
-  Anything you need, let me know.
-  Yeah.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.958
- What year is this Silverado?
-  2020.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.458
- How many miles?
-  Thirty thousand.

39:09.458 --> 39:11.541
Cleary. Come check it out.

39:24.125 --> 39:25.458
It's nice, huh?

39:25.458 --> 39:26.958
Yeah.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.166
Fifty K.

39:28.666 --> 39:29.791
You can afford that?

39:30.375 --> 39:31.666
Hell yeah.

39:31.666 --> 39:32.583
Really?

39:32.583 --> 39:34.708
You're forgetting one thing.

39:34.708 --> 39:35.791
What's that?

39:36.666 --> 39:38.583
The overtime, baby.

39:38.583 --> 39:39.666
Milk it.

39:41.416 --> 39:44.541
- Does it have rear video?
-  Yes, sir. Rear and front.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.041
She was precious.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.125
She was.

39:49.125 --> 39:52.458
Thank you.
And I'm so glad that I could be here.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.541
Me too.

39:53.541 --> 39:55.000
Thank you, son.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.000
Hey.

40:38.666 --> 40:40.125
Hey, stop!

40:59.708 --> 41:04.416
<i>The Chrysler Imperial and
the New Yorker Fifth Avenue that shares...</i>

41:04.416 --> 41:06.541
<i>...are the biggest Chryslers you can buy.</i>

41:11.458 --> 41:12.916
My condolences, Will.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.000
Thank you.

41:14.916 --> 41:16.916
Um, can I talk to you for a second?

41:17.750 --> 41:18.916
Of course.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.666
A few nights ago,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.791
this guy we know
showed up at my mother's house.

41:36.875 --> 41:39.250
He was acting strange and...

41:41.750 --> 41:43.000
Strange in what way?

41:43.958 --> 41:47.166
He tried to force himself
inside the house.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.333
- How?
- I went to close the door.

41:51.333 --> 41:54.333
-  Uh-huh?
- He puts his foot in the door.

41:55.041 --> 41:56.000
Okay.

41:56.666 --> 41:57.791
What's his name?

42:00.250 --> 42:01.833
Eli Phillips.

42:02.916 --> 42:04.125
How do you know him?

42:04.958 --> 42:08.666
We bought a piece of land to develop.
This is when my dad ran the company.

42:08.666 --> 42:11.208
It was a farm. A family farm.

42:11.791 --> 42:14.125
We gave them a fair price.
They still didn't want to sell.

42:15.125 --> 42:17.208
I guess they really didn't have a choice.

42:20.125 --> 42:22.958
Anyway, after we bought it,

42:23.833 --> 42:25.666
the father committed suicide.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.041
And the son blamed it on us.

42:31.833 --> 42:34.125
He's tried to hack into
our server a few times.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.416
Our IT guy keeps blocking him.

42:36.416 --> 42:37.541
I understand.

42:38.750 --> 42:41.291
But, uh, there's not much we can do.

42:42.708 --> 42:44.333
Unless he shows up again.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.625
And if he does,

42:46.750 --> 42:47.708
you call me.

42:48.625 --> 42:49.458
Anytime.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.500
Thanks.

42:56.875 --> 43:01.958
<i>I've been abused,
harassed, tortured, bullied...</i>

43:01.958 --> 43:03.125
He was at Whitcomb.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.416
<i>The police aren't gonna do anything...</i>

43:05.416 --> 43:08.000
These are the people Summer called
in the last three months.

43:08.000 --> 43:08.916
Good.

43:08.916 --> 43:13.875
The FBI has a record that she called them
and wanted to report narcotics activity.

43:13.875 --> 43:16.375
Apparently, they gave her
the number for the DEA.

43:16.375 --> 43:18.041
They say she never called.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.583
Uh-huh.

43:21.958 --> 43:24.750
Hey, Smith. Not bad for a rookie.

43:24.750 --> 43:25.958
Thanks, boss.

43:50.791 --> 43:51.875
Fuck off!

44:01.458 --> 44:02.375
You know...

44:04.291 --> 44:05.125
Eli Phillips?

44:05.958 --> 44:09.333
I'm Detective Tom Nichols.
This is my partner Dan Cleary.

44:09.333 --> 44:10.791
Got a minute to chat?

44:12.041 --> 44:13.041
About what?

44:14.458 --> 44:15.541
Summer Elswick.

44:18.166 --> 44:19.791
Summer...

44:20.958 --> 44:22.125
Yeah, sure. No problem.

44:22.125 --> 44:24.833
Just give me one second.
Let me put some clothes on.

44:42.708 --> 44:46.125
Hey, how you doing?
You have any weapons on you?

44:46.708 --> 44:47.708
No.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.833
Okay. You mind turning around?

44:49.833 --> 44:50.916
Just turn around.

44:52.291 --> 44:54.208
Just put your arms out. Yep.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.333
There you go.

44:55.333 --> 44:58.125
Anything, uh, sharp in your pockets
that might surprise me?

44:58.125 --> 44:59.166
No.

45:00.333 --> 45:03.833
Hey, you know what? We have
the same birthday, me and you.

45:03.833 --> 45:05.291
- No shit.
-  Yep.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
Geminis, right?

45:08.500 --> 45:09.458
Gemini?

45:10.041 --> 45:11.250
May 26?

45:11.250 --> 45:12.333
Yeah.

45:12.875 --> 45:15.041
We're like, uh, twins.

45:15.041 --> 45:17.750
Saw you outside of Whitcomb
the other night.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.583
Yeah. 'Cause I was there.

45:20.583 --> 45:23.083
Yeah? What were you doing there?

45:23.083 --> 45:24.708
I heard about it.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.083
Yeah? So how'd you hear about it?

45:27.083 --> 45:28.625
Uh, police scanner.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.500
It's a little hobby of mine.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.916
I can tell you who did it,
if you guys want me to.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.291
Okay, who's that?

45:44.166 --> 45:45.166
Will Grady.

45:45.750 --> 45:49.583
Funny, he just told us you showed up at
his mother's and threatened both of them.

45:49.583 --> 45:53.166
He said... that I... Well, that's a lie.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.333
I didn't threaten anybody.

45:55.333 --> 45:57.833
- Yeah, they're both lying, both liars.
-  Anyway.

45:57.833 --> 46:00.625
If you go back, it's gonna be
considered intimidation of a witness,

46:00.625 --> 46:02.000
and you're gonna be arrested.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.916
- I didn't threaten--
- No. Listen to me.

46:03.916 --> 46:06.125
You're gonna be arrested. You understand?

46:08.583 --> 46:10.333
You know, I know who you are.

46:12.041 --> 46:16.000
I read an article about you, uh,
and your partner.

46:16.583 --> 46:17.791
Corzano?

46:17.791 --> 46:21.666
Convicted for drugs,
gambling, uh, bribery.

46:22.416 --> 46:23.416
You didn't know that?

46:24.833 --> 46:26.458
You known him six years?

46:28.041 --> 46:29.791
You didn't know anything about it?

46:31.833 --> 46:33.666
That sounds like a lie to me.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.958
Why were you really
at Whitcomb the night she was killed?

46:38.750 --> 46:40.958
Because I wanted to see Will Grady

46:41.958 --> 46:43.291
in, uh...

46:43.291 --> 46:45.000
in handcuffs.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.583
-  Why?

46:46.583 --> 46:49.000
Because he's the devil. That's why.

46:50.875 --> 46:51.833
He's a crook.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.208
They're all crooks.

46:53.916 --> 46:56.041
Like your partner.

46:57.833 --> 47:00.125
Did you have anything
to do with Summer's death?

47:05.666 --> 47:06.625
No.

47:06.625 --> 47:09.750
Good. You mind
if we take a sample of your DNA?

47:09.750 --> 47:10.666
No.

47:11.166 --> 47:13.625
- Cool. Let's do it now.
-  You mean here? Now?

47:13.625 --> 47:14.791
Yeah.

47:14.791 --> 47:18.875
I meant, no, I don't... I don't...
Uh, wouldn't like that right now.

47:18.875 --> 47:21.791
- I don't like needles.
- It's not needles. It's a Q-tip.

47:22.291 --> 47:24.458
-  Oh, they're doing Q-tips now.
- It's just a swab.

47:24.458 --> 47:27.541
- Should I talk to a lawyer?
- No, you don't need to talk to a lawyer.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.583
Call me when you make up your mind. Okay?

47:33.083 --> 47:34.625
Stay away from the Gradys.

47:36.250 --> 47:39.833
And take it easy with that hat.
You don't want to get hurt.

47:39.833 --> 47:41.541
I respect the police.

47:46.166 --> 47:48.125
What do we know about the husband?

47:48.125 --> 47:51.500
We got his license plate up at
Jackson Lake at the time of the murder.

47:52.208 --> 47:53.750
You got his car there.

47:53.750 --> 47:55.125
You don't have him.

47:55.125 --> 47:58.875
She called the FBI to report narcotics.
Do we have a record of her calling us?

47:58.875 --> 48:01.166
- No, sir. We checked.

48:04.958 --> 48:06.583
Who do we like for the DNA?

48:06.583 --> 48:08.083
-  Oh, come on...
- Jesus.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.041
I got the boyfriend for 20.

48:12.958 --> 48:14.916
Come on, Nichols. Who do you got?

48:15.833 --> 48:19.375
- Look at Allen. A steady rolling man.

48:19.375 --> 48:21.916
All right, I'll go with
Will Grady, the boyfriend.

48:21.916 --> 48:24.041
Ah, okay. Safe bet.

48:24.666 --> 48:26.791
What about you, Vic? Who do you got?

48:26.791 --> 48:30.208
Let me ask you guys a question.
When you interviewed the Eli guy,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.458
did he have a blond wig on by any chance?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.583
Nah, I'll take Eli.

48:36.583 --> 48:38.375
-  Okay.
- Nichols' twin.

48:38.375 --> 48:40.875
I'm going with the fisherman.
The ex-husband.

48:44.666 --> 48:45.791
- Here you go.
- All right.

48:47.958 --> 48:48.791
Sir?

48:49.958 --> 48:51.125
Uh, I'll pass.

48:51.833 --> 48:55.625
Remind me again why we never
put out an APB on the Chrysler?

48:56.375 --> 48:59.875
- Well, we just got a verification.
- Okay, then let's do it.

48:59.875 --> 49:01.000
- Okay.
-  Hold up.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.916
There are 8,000 Chryslers in the county.

49:02.916 --> 49:06.208
We're going to start a wild goose chase,
get everybody scared.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.833
We're going to be getting
the DNA any moment.

49:08.833 --> 49:11.708
We don't get the gift,
then we go after the Chrysler.

49:11.708 --> 49:14.416
Okay. Okay. All right.

49:14.416 --> 49:16.958
Okay, here we go.

49:16.958 --> 49:19.125
- Thank you.
-  Thank you so much.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.666
- Make some space.
- Move that.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.250
Deena's just getting drinks.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.416
Okay. Here we go.

49:23.416 --> 49:26.083
One beer
is not gonna kill the old man.

49:26.083 --> 49:28.958
-  Who wants pepperoni and sausage?
- Gimme one of those.

49:28.958 --> 49:31.916
Let me ask you something.
Does that look like a bite mark to you?

49:31.916 --> 49:34.541
-  That's good.
-  All right. That looks good.

49:34.541 --> 49:36.833
-  Who wants cheese? Anybody?
-  Thank you.

49:36.833 --> 49:39.875
-  Anybody? Anybody?
-  I got one. Thank you.

49:41.041 --> 49:44.541
Hey, we're still doing that walk-through
with the boyfriend, right?

49:44.541 --> 49:46.916
Yeah. When do you want to do it?

49:46.916 --> 49:48.708
The sooner, the better.

50:00.541 --> 50:02.416
Can you turn the recorder off, please?

50:05.500 --> 50:07.375
Have you talked to Sam Gifford yet?

50:08.666 --> 50:09.750
Yes, we have.

50:11.166 --> 50:13.583
Did he tell you
they were still seeing each other?

50:15.250 --> 50:16.250
No.

50:17.708 --> 50:18.666
Well, they were.

50:20.208 --> 50:21.583
How do you know that?

50:23.000 --> 50:24.208
I was there.

50:25.666 --> 50:26.750
You were where?

50:28.250 --> 50:30.500
They used to fool around
in some of the houses.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.416
Wait.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.541
Last time we talked,

50:33.541 --> 50:36.666
you said you didn't know the ex-husband,
and now you do.

50:36.666 --> 50:38.000
Why are you telling us now?

50:38.708 --> 50:41.166
My ex didn't want me talking to you guys.

50:41.958 --> 50:43.250
Why is that?

50:43.250 --> 50:45.333
Him and Sam work together.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.333
What kind of work does he do?

50:49.375 --> 50:51.000
He sells heroin and coke.

50:56.458 --> 50:58.291
Was Summer involved with drugs?

50:59.291 --> 51:00.291
No.

51:04.125 --> 51:06.375
- You think I can change my bet?

51:10.416 --> 51:12.208
- I'm not wearing a tie.
- You have to.

51:12.208 --> 51:14.083
Everybody will be wearing one.

51:23.583 --> 51:24.750
Stop it.

51:24.750 --> 51:25.750
I got it.

51:26.291 --> 51:29.458
- I walked in the front door.

51:29.458 --> 51:32.250
- And stopped right where you are.

51:32.916 --> 51:35.541
Uh, I noticed her shoes right here.

51:36.791 --> 51:37.833
Is that unusual?

51:38.375 --> 51:41.458
Not really.
You want to protect the floor.

51:41.458 --> 51:42.500
Hm.

51:44.208 --> 51:46.916
Um, so, I, uh...

51:48.125 --> 51:49.958
I called out for her.

51:49.958 --> 51:52.083
Um, no answer.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.458
I try her phone, nothing.

51:57.458 --> 51:58.458
And then what?

52:17.250 --> 52:18.291
I, uh...

52:21.041 --> 52:22.208
I kneeled down

52:22.958 --> 52:23.958
to, uh...

52:25.708 --> 52:27.708
to try to give her, uh, CPR.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.166
I'm sorry.

52:36.166 --> 52:37.458
It's all right.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.625
-  Excuse me.

52:52.958 --> 52:53.958
Excuse me.

53:17.583 --> 53:19.833
Have all responding units
set up a perimeter.

53:19.833 --> 53:24.500
Suspect is male, Caucasian,
33, 6'2", 190 pounds, brown hair.

53:39.166 --> 53:41.375
Hey, Sam. Can you come to the door?

53:44.875 --> 53:45.958
Open the door.

53:49.916 --> 53:51.000
Are you alone here?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.500
-  Yes. What do you want?
- Got an arrest warrant for you.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.083
-  For what?
- I think you know.

53:55.083 --> 53:57.416
- You'll have to come with us.
-  Relax. Come on.

53:57.416 --> 54:00.208
Let's go get your clothes.
All right? Come on.

54:00.208 --> 54:02.708
-  What? Why?
- We got a hit on your DNA.

54:02.708 --> 54:04.958
- Yeah, we were sleeping together.
- Okay, good.

54:04.958 --> 54:07.083
You can tell us all about it
at the station. Let's go.

54:07.083 --> 54:08.833
Wait, I gotta go to the bathroom.

54:08.833 --> 54:11.000
Okay, let's go to the bathroom.

54:39.250 --> 54:42.750
-  Sam! Shit! Fuck!

54:42.750 --> 54:44.041
Goddamn it!

54:46.750 --> 54:48.875
-  Are you hit?
- No. He's got my gun.

54:49.500 --> 54:50.583
Fuck.

55:32.875 --> 55:36.291
Sam. Put the gun down. Put your hands up.

56:01.125 --> 56:02.125
Cuff him.

56:02.750 --> 56:03.708
He's dead.

56:04.458 --> 56:05.875
What are you, a doctor?

56:07.083 --> 56:08.041
Cuff him.

56:24.583 --> 56:26.250
Thirteen kilos of heroin.

56:26.250 --> 56:29.333
We'll have the dogs go through the house.
So far so good.

56:31.666 --> 56:33.375
Pretty fucking exciting, huh?

56:35.166 --> 56:36.125
Check this out.

56:37.166 --> 56:39.750
Bullet went in, still stuck.

56:53.583 --> 56:55.375
That's why he shot at us.

56:55.875 --> 56:56.708
Hey.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.291
I'm sorry.

57:16.125 --> 57:17.833
We're going to need your gun.

57:31.041 --> 57:32.875
-  Call your rep.
- Okay.

59:10.250 --> 59:12.375
The suit you asked me about is back.

59:19.166 --> 59:21.125
Thought they were done with the banging.

59:21.125 --> 59:24.166
Well, they have to replace
a thing for your faucet.

59:30.541 --> 59:33.041
- Pretty frustrating.
-  Mm.

59:36.875 --> 59:38.958
Don't mention nothing about the limp.

59:38.958 --> 59:40.875
Nothing about the Chrysler.

59:42.541 --> 59:45.291
Nothing about the fact
that they were having an affair.

59:50.875 --> 59:52.541
They're washing their hands.

59:56.458 --> 59:58.166
You don't have to wash yours.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:05.291
But I don't want you being upset
over a guy who tried to kill you.

01:00:16.916 --> 01:00:20.583
Yeah, I'll make sure of it.
Yeah, it'll be good. All right.

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.666
See you.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:26.541
You pissed clean.

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:30.041
Now we just got to get you
requalled with your weapon.

01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:33.166
You good with that?

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:34.958
He's ready.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.750
There you go.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:40.875
Oh, thanks.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:44.416
Oh, and hey, Tom?

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:49.833
Next time, shoot him in the front.
Makes this shit go a whole lot easier.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.333
It's from the ladies over there.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.083
<i>What do you ladies do?</i>

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.250
I work at Stone Mountain.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.750
And you?

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:20.125
I don't know.

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:24.583
-  You don't know?
- She wants to get into real estate.

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:25.666
Oh.

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:28.416
So you let other people
make up their minds for you?

01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:30.041
No. No.

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:32.416
- I know a guy.
- Oh.

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:34.625
- I do know a guy. I know a guy.
- He knows a guy.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:35.875
- Hm.
- Yeah.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.166
He knows a guy.

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:38.791
Who kn... Who knows a guy.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.541
That's what happened.

01:01:46.291 --> 01:01:48.208
I still feel bad though.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.250
I lied.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:59.750
A... About knowing that she was still

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.708
sleeping with her ex.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:06.291
We all get fleeced.

01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:11.125
I was married.

01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:17.625
And my husband told his mistress
I was his roommate.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.625
-  I'm sor... I'm sorry.
- Wait...

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:29.916
- I'm sorry. That...
- What? I mean, it's fine. It's fine!

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:34.833
Get her home safe.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.541
<i>You were raised by your mom?</i>

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.583
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:00.666
<i>I assume because
you took your mother's last name.</i>

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.833
<i>Oh, no. I was raised by my father.</i>

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:11.708
<i>And your mother?</i>

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.208
I don't know my mother.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.708
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.500
<i>That's all right.</i>

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:30.875
So, as you know, this session is just
a requirement so you can get back to work.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.250
<i>Sounds good.</i>

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.625
<i>How have you been feeling?</i>

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:39.750
<i>Fine.</i>

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.541
<i>How are you sleeping?</i>

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:44.791
<i>Pretty good now.</i>

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:48.458
But you know,
for years I've had this dream.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.875
It's a recurring dream where I'm in
someone's house and there's people there.

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.791
It's like a party or something.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:04:01.291
And then these bad guys come in,
and they start shooting at everyone.

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.833
And every time I get my gun out...

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.416
I can't pull the trigger.

01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:13.333
It's a real nightmare.

01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:19.375
<i>That's a very common dream
among law enforcement.</i>

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.083
<i>Really?</i>

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:25.750
<i>Well, you know what's happened?</i>

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:27.500
Since the shooting,

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.833
I've had that same dream,

01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:33.125
but now I get to pull the trigger.

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:37.083
Interesting, huh?

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:54.500
- I hate you.
- Hey, Wally, how long you been a dope dog?

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.083
Twenty-four years. Why?

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:59.000
And you still can't tell
when someone's bluffing?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.333
Bam!

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.416
Except your wife.
I know when she's bluffing.

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:05.041
-  Fuck you.
-  Vic, tell me what a dope dog is.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:08.166
- An old-ass narc like him.
-  Oh boy.

01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:10.166
I got you.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.208
- Hey, Allen, you're in?
- No, deal me out. Deal me out.

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:20.541
You gotta take care of yourself.

01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:23.083
Take care of your family.

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:24.583
Look at Allen.

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.125
He's sick. I'm not supposed
to say nothin', but look at him.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.125
Shit happens.
You gotta think about your future.

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:32.916
- You can't be a cop forever.

01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.625
- Shit, man.
-  Paul!

01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:37.250
- Come on. You're ruining my carpet.
-  Sorry about that.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:40.250
- Sorry about that, Wally. I'm sorry.
-  Cost a lot of money.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.708
- It's all right.
-  Man, did I get you guys?

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:45.083
-  Two-hundred-pound gorilla.
- I got it.

01:06:45.083 --> 01:06:47.833
-  Now, make sure you dab that.

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:49.625
You're lucky I love you.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:52.916
Anyway, I got a gig for you at my shop.

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:54.000
If you want it.

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:57.500
Active Duty Security consultant.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.916
You like that? My idea.

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:03.833
All cops, ex-military,
all good guys, easy money.

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:06.625
All you gotta do is stand outside
a prince's penthouse.

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:07.708
It's nothing.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.875
Just something for you to think about.

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:14.916
That's a nice watch, Wally.

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:29.125
Keep it.

01:07:30.666 --> 01:07:31.791
I dunno.

01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:34.625
I want you to have it.

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.541
I don't give a fuck.
It's a Rolex. It's just a watch.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:40.000
It's your watch, Wally. I don't want it.

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:41.750
Thank you.

01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:45.958
Wally, if he doesn't want it,
I'll take it.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:48.166
How many bad guys you caught this week?

01:07:48.666 --> 01:07:50.833
I'm gonna tell you. None.

01:07:56.791 --> 01:07:58.250
-  <i>Salud.</i>
-  Yes!

01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:13.708
I know.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.291
Which one you want?

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:19.750
Seriously, pick one.

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:20.958
I'm married, Wally.

01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:22.916
So what? Hey...

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:25.125
Come on, pick one.

01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:29.208
I'm good, I'm good.

01:08:29.208 --> 01:08:30.250
All right.

01:08:30.958 --> 01:08:32.750
If you get a headache and go upstairs,

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:35.000
I'll make sure one of 'em
brings you a Tylenol.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.291
How's that sound?

01:08:41.791 --> 01:08:44.708
It's a big house. Nobody's gonna find out.

01:08:48.208 --> 01:08:50.708
Look, I had a long talk with Graeber,

01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:54.333
and we're going to recommend you
for the Medal of Valor.

01:08:59.083 --> 01:09:01.500
I don't want a medal for killing someone.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.666
You're not getting it for killing Gifford.

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.666
You're getting it
for saving Cleary's life.

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:15.375
Been doing some soul-searching.

01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:16.958
Took your advice.

01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:18.208
Oh yeah?

01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:19.291
Yeah.

01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:20.541
What's that?

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:22.166
No more Mr. Tough Guy.

01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:23.708
Getting married.

01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:26.708
Congratulations.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.875
- That's awesome.
- Thanks.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.750
Yeah, we haven't set a date yet, but, uh...

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:36.166
be honored if you'd be my best man.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:38.666
Best man, huh?

01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:42.125
That's a lot of work, Dan.

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:48.208
- Okay, okay, uh... How about an usher?

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:50.708
An usher. Yeah.

01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:51.791
We can do that.

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:53.166
Okay, good.

01:09:53.166 --> 01:09:55.208
My future mother-in-law's
already up my ass

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:58.375
about getting my sperm tested,
make sure I'm still potent.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:00.583
I hate when that happens.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:32.541
Ow!

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:34.166
Right there.

01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:37.291
Right there.

01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:38.291
Yeah.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.166
That's a bite.

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:54.208
It was the dentals that got Ted Bundy.

01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:59.166
<i>I'm pretty sure you're right.
This looks like a human bite to me.</i>

01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.958
<i>So what do you want me to do?</i>

01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:02.958
You tell me. You're the expert.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:07.916
<i>Get me the dentals of this Gifford guy
and maybe we can rule him out.</i>

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:13.916
Who confirmed that this is a human bite?

01:11:13.916 --> 01:11:16.833
A forensic odontologist friend of mine
I used in Philly.

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:18.416
Uh-huh?

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:21.750
How do we know those weren't
there from a few days before?

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:25.875
Well, unless her hands were tied
in that position two days before,

01:11:26.541 --> 01:11:27.916
that was done at Whitcomb.

01:11:29.166 --> 01:11:30.125
So?

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:33.083
What do you want to do?

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.791
I want to get
Sam Gifford's dental impressions.

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.333
See if they match.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:43.583
You really want to do that?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I feel it's the right thing to do.

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:55.750
We don't want someone else to get killed
because we didn't do our job, huh?

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.416
I won't stop you.

01:12:24.916 --> 01:12:28.291
You sure you're not doing this
to milk the overtime for that truck?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.666
<i>Front door open.</i>

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:28.000
I'm in the kitchen.

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:38.916
Hi.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.041
Will. Hey.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.583
- Hi.
-  Nice to meet you.

01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:45.916
I'm glad you both could make it.

01:13:48.125 --> 01:13:49.500
What year is this place?

01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.541
1968. Yeah.

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:54.708
Let me show you around.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:01.375
That was the living area,
and here's your dining room.

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:04.750
You could fit a table of ten to 12 easy.

01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:08.958
Can we see the bedroom?

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.041
Sure.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.583
Up the stairs here.

01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:30.875
Here's your master bedroom.

01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:38.250
Got a his-and-hers closets
and a full bath.

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:41.166
-  This is where it happened.
- You...

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:44.750
-  Perfect. That's great.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.666
-  Yes.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:49.333
Whoa, that's sexy.

01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:58.583
- What the fuck are you doing?
-  Oh.

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:01.333
Hey, can she take a picture with you?

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:02.708
- Please?
- Get out.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:05.541
- It would be perfect--
- Get the fuck out!

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:19.833
Fuck.

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:35.791
Now we know. We go from here.

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:36.875
Thank you.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.333
Don't be scared, now.

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:45.583
It's inconclusive.

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:48.125
What did he say?

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:51.958
The bite is not deep enough.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:16:00.791
Okay, so do you have any objections
to us closing the case?

01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:04.958
Nah.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.875
Okay, Captain. See you in six months.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.125
<i>You tried, babe.</i>

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.875
We tried.

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:44.958
<i>It was here at this abandoned
storefront on Hill Street</i>

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:49.208
<i>that a scary car collision
turned into something far more shocking.</i>

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:54.916
<i>The driver of this GMC Suburban collided
with a Ford Explorer and was stuck inside.</i>

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:58.125
<i>When police finally extracted
the man from the vehicle</i>,

01:16:58.125 --> 01:17:01.875
<i>they found 13 kilos of heroin
in the back seat.</i>

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:05.333
<i>Police believe the man was trafficking
the drugs from the storefront</i>

01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.250
<i>and reversed...</i>

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:08.375
-  <i>Talking basketball--</i>

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:11.750
<i>...they found 13 kilos of heroin
in the back seat.</i>

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:15.791
<i>Police believe the man was
trafficking the drugs from the storefront</i>

01:17:15.791 --> 01:17:17.916
<i>and reversed without looking.</i>

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:20.125
<i>- Thankfully, none of the--</i>

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:30.250
...<i>more flooding today</i>

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.416
<i>as record rainfall
continues to pound the region,</i>

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:35.291
<i>stranding drivers and even train crews.</i>

01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:48.958
Yeah.

01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:56.916
Looks like someone was locked inside

01:17:56.916 --> 01:18:00.083
and went out the window
with the chair, huh?

01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:02.333
Any blood?

01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:03.416
No, sir.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:11.958
So is there anyone you can think of
who might have done this?

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.375
I don't know.

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:19.125
How 'bout that Eli Phillips guy?

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.708
Look, I took a look around.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:32.000
Aside from the broken window,

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.291
my mom's computer's here,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.583
I didn't see anything of importance
that was missing.

01:18:38.083 --> 01:18:40.125
Well, it is a big building.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:42.625
Maybe have just one more look around.
Take some time--

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:44.875
I told you
we need to get cameras.

01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:45.958
I know.

01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:01.916
<i>When police learned
that Stephanie's hair was long</i>

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:06.708
<i>and in a ponytail the day before she died,
they realized that her killer had...</i>

01:20:13.166 --> 01:20:16.250
- <i>♪ I see no need to take me home ♪</i>

01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:22.416
<i>♪ I'm old enough to face the dawn ♪</i>

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:29.541
<i>♪ Just call me angel of the morning ♪</i>

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:31.541
<i>♪ Angel ♪</i>

01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:35.791
<i>♪ Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me ♪</i>

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.500
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:38.916
Take your finger off the trigger.

01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:41.458
You okay?

01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:43.541
He was creeping around.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:45.958
Lower your gun.

01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:54.125
You told me when I was ready
to talk that I should reach out.

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:56.166
- Call the police.
- I did.

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:00.208
Give me your gun, babe.

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:04.166
Go get dressed.

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:05.750
Babe, come here.

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:10.375
- I'm proud of you.

01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.541
I got something I want to show you.

01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:24.375
Something that will prove
the Gradys are fucking crooks.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:31.333
Did you know that Summer was being
ripped off by a company called White Fish?

01:22:32.916 --> 01:22:33.750
No?

01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:39.000
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:45.125
I don't have to be redeemed,
you understand?

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.708
Do you know who Rudi Rakoczy is?

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.291
- Never heard of him.

01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:59.041
He works for the Gradys.
You're not listening to me!

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:00.208
Back here!

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:04.875
Rudi Rakoczy was picked up
with... with 13 kilos of heroin.

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:06.583
You're not fucking listening to me.

01:23:06.583 --> 01:23:09.291
The Gradys are just laundering drug money.
For fuck's sake!

01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:12.041
You know my father died
with a gun in his mouth?

01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:15.666
From a farm that he built
with his own fucking hands!

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:18.958
You're a bigger crook than them
if you don't do something about it!

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.333
The Gradys are crooks!

01:24:36.166 --> 01:24:38.625
The fuck did your Gemini twin want?

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:41.000
- Fuck if I know.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.666
- Maybe he wanted to go swimming.

01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:48.583
Thanks. Judy should've
put a fucking bullet in his head.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.250
Instead, she put a bullet in the pool.

01:24:57.458 --> 01:24:59.291
-  I got it.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:40.458
No commissions.
No commissions. What the fuck?

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:45.541
<i>Hi.</i>

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:48.541
<i>Where can I find the drug-related
civil asset forfeitures?</i>

01:27:13.666 --> 01:27:15.583
<i>White Fish isn't active anymore.</i>

01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:17.291
Do you have anything on it?

01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:19.708
<i>All I got is an old PO box. That's it.</i>

01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:23.083
Okay.

01:27:23.083 --> 01:27:24.000
<i>Wait.</i>

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:27.666
<i>There's another company
with that same PO Box.</i>

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.041
What's it called?

01:27:33.041 --> 01:27:34.541
<i>A private security company.</i>

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.083
<i>Active Duty Consulting.</i>

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.500
Okay, Jimmy.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.250
I'll take it from here.

01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:59.416
<i>Yeah, the bust from the other day,
Rakoczy, can I see that?</i>

01:28:09.708 --> 01:28:11.875
Another one lost
to the dark side.

01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:14.125
What do you mean?

01:28:14.625 --> 01:28:16.208
He's C.I., Rakoczy.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:20.000
He was an informant for us for years
and now he's got 15 years on his head.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.750
When was this booked into evidence?

01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:48.875
September 21st at midnight.

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:51.958
Can I see the drugs
from the Sam Gifford case?

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:55.541
They were sent up for disposal.

01:28:56.875 --> 01:28:57.833
When?

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.291
8:30 a.m. on September 21st.

01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:01.375
By who?

01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:03.166
Wally Finn.

01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:07.125
Uh-huh.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:09.833
<i>Scarborough PD. This is Jimmy.</i>

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:12.041
Hey Jimmy, I need a favor.

01:29:12.041 --> 01:29:15.166
I need the phone records
of a Rudi Rakoczy.

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:25.291
I need you to sign here.

01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:29.291
- How am I supposed to do that?
-  Unhook him.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.958
Who bailed me out?

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.541
LILC Bail Bonds.

01:29:35.666 --> 01:29:39.041
L... LILC Bail Bonds?

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:41.083
- I had a knife.

01:29:41.083 --> 01:29:43.166
Um, can I have my knife back, please?

01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:45.833
Change in there.
When you come back, you get your knife.

01:29:56.541 --> 01:29:58.916
The next thing I knew,
it just went off.

01:29:58.916 --> 01:30:02.416
And the guy was on the floor.
Turned out I hit the pool.

01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:05.333
- Oh my God. I'm glad you're okay.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.333
How are you?

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:20.416
Good.

01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:25.833
Where's everyone?

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:26.833
I dunno.

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:29.583
But Deena said that they're
gonna stay home for the night.

01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:32.625
- Is Allen okay?
- Yeah.

01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:38.875
Is that Peter over there? Our contractor?

01:30:40.083 --> 01:30:41.208
Oh yeah.

01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:45.958
What's he doing here?

01:30:46.791 --> 01:30:49.083
- I might have told him about it.
- Okay.

01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:52.166
That was a lot more fun than I remembered.
Haven't done that since I was a kid.

01:30:52.166 --> 01:30:54.750
-  Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.916
I saw the owner of Zuzu's.
Should I tell her about my bags?

01:30:57.916 --> 01:30:59.333
Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:00.583
Go on. Yeah.

01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:11.083
How's that, uh...
that new kitchen treating you?

01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:13.958
You find her attractive?

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:16.416
Which one?

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:20.458
How far would you go?

01:31:22.583 --> 01:31:23.583
Excuse me?

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:26.541
No, are you willing to die for it?

01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:32.125
I... I don't know what
we're talking about here, Tom.

01:31:32.833 --> 01:31:34.625
You don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about?

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:38.208
-  No. Absolutely no idea.
- Holy shit. You're fucking cute.

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:43.791
I'm warning you, man.

01:31:43.791 --> 01:31:45.666
Don't let me fucking catch you.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.625
How'd it go?

01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:49.708
Done. Should we hit the floor?

01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:51.416
Uh, I'm okay.

01:31:52.166 --> 01:31:54.083
Peter, want to go?

01:31:57.375 --> 01:31:59.375
No, I'm going to sit this one out.

01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:01.750
No?

01:32:02.958 --> 01:32:03.958
Okay.

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:07.416
You and me, babe. How 'bout it?

01:32:30.166 --> 01:32:32.166
No. He was more scared than I was.

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:34.416
<i>Did he say why he was there?</i>

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:36.333
He said he knew Tom.

01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:39.083
And he tried to leave,
so I fired a warning shot.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.458
<i>Hey, Tom.
Got the phone records you wanted.</i>

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:04.958
<i>You know, uh, the only weird thing I see
is that this Rudi Rakoczy guy</i>

01:33:04.958 --> 01:33:10.208
<i>called this 3586 number 17 times
the day Summer Elswick was killed.</i>

01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:12.583
<i>Anyway, food for thought.</i>

01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.250
<i>Just found that interesting.</i>

01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:17.833
809-122-3586.

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:15.125
Hello?

01:34:15.125 --> 01:34:18.583
<i>Hey, this is ADT Security calling
about your upcoming camera install.</i>

01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:54.166
<i>I'm sorry, but the person you called</i>

01:34:54.166 --> 01:34:57.375
<i>has a voice mailbox
that has not been set up yet.</i>

01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:00.875
I don't want any trouble.

01:35:02.166 --> 01:35:04.166
I just want what you took from me.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:14.250
What I took... from you?

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.500
Charming.

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:25.916
- I'll tell you what.

01:35:25.916 --> 01:35:28.500
You give me back
what you took from the office,

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:30.958
and I won't press charges.

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:33.416
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:37.666
I give you what I took from your office,

01:35:37.666 --> 01:35:39.541
and you don't press charges?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.625
-  Very good.
- Fuck you.

01:35:44.583 --> 01:35:45.833
How's your mom doing?

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:48.208
She still kicking?

01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.416
No, she's... she's dead, Will.
You know that.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.375
You two know each other, right?

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.458
What's the difference between me and you?

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:19.708
What do you mean?

01:36:20.625 --> 01:36:22.833
What's the difference between me and you?

01:36:25.416 --> 01:36:28.666
You talk a good one, but you don't
do what you're supposed to do.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And what's that?

01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.250
You don't know that song?

01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.166
No, I don't.

01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:48.458
What about you?

01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:51.041
- What's that?

01:36:51.041 --> 01:36:53.375

01:36:54.166 --> 01:36:55.375

Jesus Christ,
this clown thinks it's Wu-Tang.

01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:00.083
It's Dr. Dre.

01:37:36.416 --> 01:37:37.416
Hello?

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:45.625
Hello?

01:38:19.708 --> 01:38:20.875
<i>Here's what I got.</i>

01:38:20.875 --> 01:38:23.708
<i>That 3586 phone number I flagged for you.</i>

01:38:23.708 --> 01:38:25.875
<i>It belongs to a property trust.</i>

01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:27.791
No shit.

01:38:28.416 --> 01:38:29.541
What else you got?

01:38:30.041 --> 01:38:33.750
<i>All I see is that it's listed under W6.</i>

01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:39.083
I talked to Deena, and they can
get the stem cell in the Bahamas,

01:38:39.083 --> 01:38:42.083
but it's expensive
and their insurance won't cover it.

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:45.458
Well, they can afford it.

01:38:46.041 --> 01:38:47.041
Right?

01:38:47.041 --> 01:38:48.041
Yeah.

01:38:53.291 --> 01:38:54.791
Is everything okay?

01:38:54.791 --> 01:38:56.250
Yeah, everything's okay.

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:59.166
- I think we're finished here.
- Babe, you didn't even eat.

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:01.041
I'm not hungry. We'll take this to go.

01:39:01.041 --> 01:39:02.750
Would you like any dessert?

01:39:03.625 --> 01:39:04.916
Um...

01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.458
- No.
- We'll just have the check, please.

01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:08.541
Thank you.

01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:14.333
Oh my God. Look who's here.

01:39:15.208 --> 01:39:16.208
Who?

01:39:16.916 --> 01:39:17.916
Will Grady.

01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:29.166
Is that his girlfriend?

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:37.083
That was fast.

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:39.416
Guess people grieve differently.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.375
So they're covering all the closing costs.

01:39:44.958 --> 01:39:46.000
They were eager.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.500
You should've heard this guy
with the other broker.

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.083
He was an animal.
Didn't know you had it in you.

01:39:51.083 --> 01:39:53.541
Well, I learned from the best.

01:39:55.625 --> 01:39:57.291
- You got your card?
-  Yeah.

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.541
- Okay, I'm gonna go say hello.
-  Okay.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Thank you.

01:40:41.333 --> 01:40:43.166
-  Everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:03.625
Hey.

01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:05.375
You're early.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.375
- You found it good?
-  Yeah, yeah.

01:41:11.541 --> 01:41:15.625
Oh. It's the first time I've ever
shown a house at gunpoint.

01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:20.875
- You're not afraid of guns, are you?
- Not if they're in the right hands.

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:21.958
Oh good.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.041
Come on in.

01:41:27.208 --> 01:41:30.666
So this was a formal living room,

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:34.500
but I think it'd make a great study
or an office.

01:41:36.833 --> 01:41:41.041
And in here,
you've got more of your family room.

01:41:41.625 --> 01:41:47.208
Could put a TV up there,
and there's great outdoor space as well.

01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:51.750
Through here, got your kitchen.

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:58.208
Now, I think it looks a little dated,

01:41:58.208 --> 01:42:01.791
but, uh, you know, you can replace
these countertops with, uh,

01:42:01.791 --> 01:42:03.583
granite or some type of marble.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.291
If your wife loves to cook,

01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:08.416
I mean, I think she'll love this.

01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:14.250
This is my favorite room in the house.

01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:20.125
I mean, you could have a kids' playroom
or, you know, a man cave.

01:42:36.166 --> 01:42:37.541
Wanna see the upstairs?

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.000
Let's start this way.

01:42:53.541 --> 01:42:55.291
Right through to the master.

01:42:56.541 --> 01:42:59.208
This is a relic
from the previous owner.

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:03.416
It's a street-facing view.

01:43:04.125 --> 01:43:05.708
You know, it's a good room,

01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:08.333
but I'd rip out the carpets
and start fresh.

01:43:14.791 --> 01:43:15.666
You gonna answer that?

01:43:21.125 --> 01:43:22.166
Fuck.

01:43:24.958 --> 01:43:26.416
Let 'em leave a message.

01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:38.875
Piece of shit real estate agent.

01:43:39.958 --> 01:43:40.958
What?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.125
What is it, babe?

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.416
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:09.791
Are you ready, babe?

01:44:10.291 --> 01:44:11.291
I'm ready.

01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:24.750
-  Happy birthday.
- There they are!

01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:28.041
There she is. Hey, beautiful.

01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:29.458
- Hey, Tommy.
-  Happy birthday.

01:44:29.458 --> 01:44:32.333
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something, just you and me.

01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:34.000
- Perfect. Me too.
- Okay?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.250
- All right.
-  Okay.

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:37.875
Mahalo!

01:44:37.875 --> 01:44:39.833
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:44:39.833 --> 01:44:41.750
- One for you.
-  Mm-hm.

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:44.458
-  Hello.
- Hello, hello. Mwah!

01:44:45.375 --> 01:44:47.875

Why are you avoiding me?

01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:31.000
I'm not avoiding you.

You haven't even said hello.

01:46:10.666 --> 01:46:11.833
What's happening?

01:46:13.958 --> 01:46:16.125
It's been confirmed.
You're getting the medal.

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.541
Hey, you're up here?

01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:25.875
Come on up.
We just got some great news.

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:26.875

Well, it's just been confirmed.

01:46:30.583 --> 01:46:32.750
Tommy's getting the Medal of Valor.

Congratulations.

01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:35.083
Good for you.

01:46:35.083 --> 01:46:37.250
It's the second-highest honor.

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:40.666
Only one higher is the Medal of Honor.

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:42.875

01:46:47.083 --> 01:46:48.916

01:49:21.416 --> 01:49:23.500
Just like the one at Whitcomb.

01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:27.333
Yeah, I'm storing it for someone.

01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:29.166
For who?

01:49:35.166 --> 01:49:36.666
Tommy...

01:49:38.458 --> 01:49:40.833
You and Judy have a good thing here.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:43.500
Let it go.

01:49:51.875 --> 01:49:53.833
Let's have a good time tonight.

01:51:08.583 --> 01:51:11.208
Oklahoma, you in or out?

01:51:15.708 --> 01:51:17.333
Are you in or you out?

01:51:22.458 --> 01:51:23.541
He's in.

01:51:50.791 --> 01:51:52.625
You weren't going to tell me?

01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:55.708
What?

01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:59.416
The medal comes with 20 grand.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.250
Huh.

01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:43.833
What's taking them so long?

01:53:30.041 --> 01:53:33.750
I'm stopping you because you didn't
come to a complete stop at the stop sign.

01:53:35.166 --> 01:53:37.000
License and registration, please.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.833
You need to be more careful.

01:53:44.833 --> 01:53:46.166
It's dark out there.

01:53:47.208 --> 01:53:48.750
-  Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:54:01.083 --> 01:54:02.750
I can see what's happening here.

01:54:04.333 --> 01:54:06.166
Celebrating a little with your wife?

01:54:06.666 --> 01:54:09.083
How much further do you have
to go to get your house?

01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:10.666
Three minutes.

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.291
I'll need to follow you home.

01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:16.208
Thank you.

01:54:16.208 --> 01:54:19.083
By the way, congratulations on your medal.

01:54:19.708 --> 01:54:21.083
Much deserved, sir.

01:54:30.833 --> 01:54:33.625
Are you gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:54:39.291 --> 01:54:41.791
Why don't you ask your uncle
what the fuck is going on?

01:54:43.166 --> 01:54:44.791
What are you talking about?

01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.916
<i>White Fish is Wally and Will Grady.</i>

01:54:55.125 --> 01:54:58.083
<i>Wally plants the dope,
and the houses get seized.</i>

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
<i>Then White Fish buys them.</i>

01:55:04.541 --> 01:55:06.375
<i>Summer was the broker.</i>

01:55:07.833 --> 01:55:11.416
<i>On paper, she made 70 grand,
but she didn't see a penny.</i>

01:55:11.416 --> 01:55:13.500
<i>She didn't know anything about it.</i>

01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:18.750
<i>So they killed
that girl over money?</i>

01:55:20.041 --> 01:55:21.250
<i>No.</i>

01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.875
<i>She was gonna talk.</i>

01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:34.875
You gotta tell Allen.

01:55:44.916 --> 01:55:46.625
What are you telling me right now?

01:55:46.625 --> 01:55:47.875
He's in on it.

01:55:48.416 --> 01:55:49.416
What?

01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:53.291
He's either one of them
or he's helping them.

01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:55.833
What do you mean?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.875
The Chrysler we've been looking for?

01:56:01.375 --> 01:56:04.500
It's sitting in his garage right now,
as we speak.

01:56:06.375 --> 01:56:07.458
The Chrysler.

01:56:07.958 --> 01:56:08.958
Yeah.

01:56:17.208 --> 01:56:18.291
I know.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.125
It's crazy.

01:56:27.333 --> 01:56:31.541
There's only one thing I love
almost as much as I love you.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.500
And that's being a cop.

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:40.583
And you know what?

01:56:40.583 --> 01:56:42.875
This thing does not love me.

01:56:49.416 --> 01:56:51.375
-  It's him.

01:56:51.375 --> 01:56:53.041
Does he know that you know?

01:56:54.166 --> 01:56:55.041
Yeah.

01:56:55.791 --> 01:56:59.625
I'm gonna need you to pack a bag.
We're not sleeping here tonight.

01:57:02.583 --> 01:57:04.041
- Hello.
-  <i>Hi, Tom.</i>

01:57:04.541 --> 01:57:05.791
You got a second?

01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:08.125
Yeah.

01:57:08.833 --> 01:57:12.208
Listen, I want us to talk about the thing.

01:57:12.958 --> 01:57:16.375
There's an explanation.
It... It's not what you think.

01:57:16.375 --> 01:57:17.458
Okay.

01:57:18.125 --> 01:57:21.958
What do you say to coming over to
the house tomorrow morning so we can talk?

01:57:22.916 --> 01:57:23.750
<i>What time?</i>

01:57:24.458 --> 01:57:25.458
<i>Nine a.m.?</i>

01:57:26.291 --> 01:57:28.291
- Sounds good.
<i>- I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

01:57:33.875 --> 01:57:35.458
It's gonna be fine.

01:57:39.125 --> 01:57:42.125
He's kept his mouth shut before.
He'll do it again.

01:57:47.875 --> 01:57:49.916
And you think Summer knew

01:57:49.916 --> 01:57:52.666
that our department
was involved in all this shit?

01:57:52.666 --> 01:57:53.875
Yes, sir. I do.

01:57:54.458 --> 01:57:57.208
I think that's why she called the FBI
and not us.

01:58:03.291 --> 01:58:05.541
When you asked Allen about the car,

01:58:06.791 --> 01:58:08.041
what did he say?

01:58:08.541 --> 01:58:10.833
He said he was keeping it for someone.

01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:13.500
Did he say who?

01:58:23.416 --> 01:58:25.625
Tom, I've known him for 40 years.

01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:28.875
This is crazy.

01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:33.208
You tell anyone about this?

01:58:36.833 --> 01:58:37.833
No, sir.

01:59:29.041 --> 01:59:30.041
Hi, Allen.

01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:33.583
It's the two of us.

01:59:34.708 --> 01:59:36.000
We just want to talk.

01:59:38.583 --> 01:59:39.583
Come in.

01:59:45.375 --> 01:59:46.583
You want coffee?

01:59:47.791 --> 01:59:49.041
No, I'm okay.

01:59:50.291 --> 01:59:51.208
Tom?

01:59:52.375 --> 01:59:53.458
I'm fine.

02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:07.083
- Where's Deena?
-  She is in church.

02:00:14.541 --> 02:00:16.958
And you're here because of the car.

02:00:16.958 --> 02:00:18.083
Well, we...

02:00:18.958 --> 02:00:20.875
We're a little concerned, Allen.

02:00:21.625 --> 02:00:24.250
We want to talk
about a few other things too.

02:00:30.166 --> 02:00:31.750
Let's take it upstairs.

02:00:36.083 --> 02:00:37.333
I gotta take a leak.

02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:40.541
I'll meet you up there.

02:00:45.416 --> 02:00:46.833
You know where it is.

02:00:52.458 --> 02:00:54.041
Get out of here.

02:00:57.375 --> 02:00:59.583
You gave them the drive.

02:01:00.291 --> 02:01:01.791
They know everything.

02:01:02.958 --> 02:01:05.208
Go. Get out of here.

02:01:13.333 --> 02:01:14.750
He knows.

02:01:17.166 --> 02:01:18.000
It's over.

02:01:34.208 --> 02:01:35.375
Tom.

02:01:36.166 --> 02:01:39.208
It's me. Just put the gun down.

02:01:40.791 --> 02:01:43.000
Sir, don't do it.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Tom, put it down.

02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:47.583
No.

02:02:50.250 --> 02:02:51.708
Fuck.

02:03:46.125 --> 02:03:47.708
I can't feel my legs.

02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:51.500
I can't feel my legs.

02:04:17.541 --> 02:04:18.791
Oklahoma.

02:04:19.375 --> 02:04:20.333
Hey.

02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:25.916
Oklahoma.

02:04:33.458 --> 02:04:34.541
Finish it.
