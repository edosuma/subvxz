[helicopter whirring]

00:35.136 --> 00:37.205
This is our target.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.640
He's to be captured,
not harmed.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.179
Which man is it?

00:45.213 --> 00:47.081
We're after the canine.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.617
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

00:49.650 --> 00:53.053
Translation:
"Dog of Ageless Wonder."

00:53.887 --> 00:56.357
Uh, sir, this picture's
80 years old.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.725
Everybody in it is dead.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.395
Not everyone.

01:20.648 --> 01:24.118
[monks chanting]

02:51.905 --> 02:53.874
"It's misguided youth.
Your Honor..."

02:53.907 --> 02:56.910
That sounds so pompous.
Can't... What's another
word for misguided?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.413
Misguided...
It's too on the money.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.781
Um...

03:02.416 --> 03:03.817
Dog!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.553
Hey, Baxter!

03:05.586 --> 03:08.656
Why is it that my yard
is that mutt's outhouse?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.825
Uhh, FYI,
calling Attila a mutt

03:11.859 --> 03:14.528
is like referring
to my Porsche Carrera

03:14.562 --> 03:16.264
as a Buick Skylark.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.267
Hey, look, whatever kind
of car your dog is,

03:19.300 --> 03:22.270
I'd appreciate it if he
wasn't whizzin' on my shrubs.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.838
You know what your problem is,
Dave. You hate dogs.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.342
No, I do not hate dogs.
I dislike dogs.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.612
I hate that dog.
Now get outta here!

03:31.645 --> 03:33.614
Oh, stop that. You did
not hear that, did you?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.516
You did not hear that.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.751
Are you OK? Baby?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.753
Forrester got himself
in the newspaper today.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.455
[chanting on TV]
No more testing!

03:41.489 --> 03:42.856
And all over the TV.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.792
[reporter] The trial
of Justin Forrester,

03:44.825 --> 03:47.261
a local schoolteacher
accused of arson

03:47.295 --> 03:49.730
- in a fire at
Grant & Strictland.
- Great.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.632
Well, ya just can't
burn a building down,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.568
because you think they're
puttin' makeup on bunnies.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.606
You're going to
Josh's parent-teacher
conference, right?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.574
- Josh!
- What?

04:00.608 --> 04:03.977
Josh's parent-teacher thing?
Four o'clock?

04:04.011 --> 04:06.246
[woman] You said
you'd take care of it.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.483
[sighs] Honey, I...
I'm starting a trial today.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.918
Ken Hollister's
stepping down.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.654
[Dave] Don't you want me
to be the next DA?

04:13.687 --> 04:16.923
Dave, you never make
these things.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.594
All right.
I'll take him.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.465
Look, you know what?
Let me say, once...

04:24.498 --> 04:26.400
Once I get through
all this stuff,

04:26.434 --> 04:29.303
why don't I take you
to Oahu?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.407
You know that way that
you always say "Oahu,"

04:33.441 --> 04:34.808
and you think it's so cute?

04:34.842 --> 04:38.312
It really just reminds me
of how many times
you've canceled that trip.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.415
- [boy] Hey, Dad.
- Hey, good mornin', Josh.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.616
How's football goin'?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.585
Awesome.
I'm playin' tailback.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.987
Just like your old man.
Well, I can't wait.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.423
When can I come down
and watch you play?

04:49.457 --> 04:52.426
Oh, um, you know, the games
don't start for a while.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.927
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.696
Mornin'.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.965
Hey, take
the T-shirt off.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.100
Why? Did you
drop the charges?

05:00.133 --> 05:03.471
You know, this might be hard
for you to understand, sweetie,

05:03.504 --> 05:05.005
but your social studies
teacher,

05:05.038 --> 05:06.940
the Torch, is a criminal.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.511
What's hard to believe
is that my father is
defending a puppy-murderer.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.846
Who're you gonna put
in jail next? Grandma?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.449
Well, the way she cooks,
I should put her in jail.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.451
Here's your...
here's your buddy,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.720
your hero, your
social studies teacher.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.457
This guy lit a lab on fire,
and he coulda killed
a lot of people.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.659
Yeah, but he says he's
innocent, and I believe him.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.462
Gee, a criminal who thinks
he's innocent. What a concept.

05:28.496 --> 05:31.064
- [car horn honks]
- Oh. That's Trey.
Josh, you want a ride?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.033
In Trey's car? Yeah.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.536
Thanks. Here you go.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.739
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.007
[chewing] Bye.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.478
[Dave] Oh, nice shirt.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.481
If I was puttin' your
physics teacher in jail,
you'd be thrilled.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.516
[door closes]

05:50.784 --> 05:55.423
Justin Forrester is
a passionate advocate
of animal rights.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.425
And I respect that.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.160
But this case is not
about animal rights.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.531
This case is about
whether the defendant

06:03.564 --> 06:07.401
criminally trespassed on
Grant & Strictland property

06:07.435 --> 06:08.836
and set a fire

06:08.869 --> 06:12.840
that caused over $300,000
worth of damage.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.677
[Dave] He broke into a company
that's dedicated to good.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.946
From their organic
pet foods and shampoos

06:18.979 --> 06:21.081
to their
life-saving medicines.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.685
Created by them to help
people like you and me

06:24.718 --> 06:27.955
fight heart disease,
arthritis,

06:27.988 --> 06:31.492
diabetes, obesity.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.596
And yes, even baldness.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.033
[Dave] We will, by the way,
subpoena that tape.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.103
I'm sorry, that's all the time
I have. Thank you all very much.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.038
Dave. Here's your messages.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.575
And I am holding 4:00 open
for your kid thing.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.209
OK, 4:00 for the kid thing.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.880
Unless you want me to go
for you. 'Cause I will.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.082
No, thanks. Thanks.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.885
Dave.
Hey. Great opening.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.419
You really
won over that jury.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.954
I learned everything
from you, Ken.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.289
- Dr. Kozak.
- Yes.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.726
Glad to have ya here.
Sorry I couldn't put you
on the stand today.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.094
All right. Apology accepted.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.730
Ken tells me that
when he steps down,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.765
you're gonna be
our next district attorney.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.901
- Well, that's my hope.
- Certainly.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.903
Well, hopefully justice
will be served.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.839
You'll have my support
as well as that of
Grant & Strictland.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.741
- Till tomorrow? OK.
- All right.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.976
- Once again.
- We actually just
shook hands.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.177
Yes, we did.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.656
Thank you.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.592
Kozak. How did it go
in court today?

07:38.626 --> 07:41.028
Ah, Mr. Strictland.
Uh... [stammers]

07:41.061 --> 07:43.163
It went very,
very, very well, sir.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.668
Have you unlocked
the dog's secret?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.269
Let's talk in
the elevator, OK?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.172
I have something
to show you that I think
will be most pleasing.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.679
Have you figured out
why the dog lives so long?

07:58.712 --> 08:02.282
Well, I... I take it you're
familiar with the concept
of dog years, sir?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.785
- Don't like dogs.
- You don't like...

08:04.818 --> 08:07.120
- I keep a squirrel.
- OK. A pet squirrel.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.122
That's, uh, something.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.960
Typically, dogs age seven years
for every human year.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.129
But in the case
of this one,

08:16.163 --> 08:19.800
this one that we
borrowed from Tibet,

08:19.833 --> 08:23.236
a genetic mutation
reversed the equation.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.838
What I'm saying is,

08:24.872 --> 08:28.075
he lives seven years
for every human year.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.513
Sir, this dog is
over 300 years old.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.556
[Strictland] Hmm.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.326
The things
you must have seen.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.929
If we could transmit
that gene to humans,

08:48.962 --> 08:51.231
we'd all live 700 years.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.034
[man] We've isolated
the gene fairly quickly.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.570
But we're unable
to viralize it outside his body

08:56.604 --> 08:58.572
for transmission
to other species.

08:58.606 --> 09:02.710
Therefore, we've had
to viralize his entire
genetic code in corpus.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.346
[Strictland] Which makes
his bodily fluids...

09:06.379 --> 09:09.216
- [woman]
Pretty dangerous stuff.
- [Kozak] Somewhat.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.953
But it would have
to enter the bloodstream
to do any serious damage.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.689
- [man] Correct.
We're really careful.
- [Kozak] Mm-hm.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.558
- [Strictland] How close are we?
- [Kozak] How 'bout the snake?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.994
Let's go look at the snake,
see how the snake's doin'.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.031
You might be interested
to know, sir,

09:24.064 --> 09:26.199
that when we got this snake,
he was nearly dead.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.969
He was nearly dead
of old age.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.938
Since we injected him
with the serum

09:30.971 --> 09:33.040
made from the dog's
viralized DNA,

09:33.073 --> 09:35.709
all cell degradation
has ceased.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.711
And he's actually
been getting stronger.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.280
Does that snake
have a furry tail?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.282
Uh, that would be
a-a-a side effect

09:42.315 --> 09:44.584
that I would classify
as, uh, minor.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.656
Kozak, dry mouth
is minor side effect.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.324
Growing a dog's tail
is... [stammers]

09:51.358 --> 09:53.226
It makes your serum
into a carnival act.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.064
You know what? Your job
is to relax. Our job is
to work out the kinks, OK?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.166
Because when we do, Lance,

09:59.199 --> 10:02.302
you and I are gonna have
the patent on the fountain
of youth.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.304
[cell phone rings]

10:04.337 --> 10:06.606
Ah. Excuse me.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.743
Uh, yeah, Security.
Go for Kozak.

10:09.777 --> 10:13.613
[all chanting] Grant
& Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

10:13.647 --> 10:15.983
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

10:16.016 --> 10:19.086
When I called you,
it was to make sure
these people were arrested.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.487
I understand that.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.258
If we arrest them, they turn
into rebels with a cause
on the 6:00 news.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.161
If we leave 'em there,
they're just kids
layin' on the sidewalk.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.964
- [girl] Puppy-killers!
- ...so we're lying down!

10:30.998 --> 10:33.266
Hmm. Good advice. All right.
Thanks for your help.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.703
- You bet.
- I'm good.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.270
Let's go.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.808
All right, fellas,
let's just get some sort
of perimeter on this.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.010
They're just kids.
Let 'em do their thing.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.278
When they get hungry,
they're all gonna go home.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.982
- Hold on a minute.
- Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

10:49.016 --> 10:52.185
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

10:52.219 --> 10:55.022
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Carly.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.157
What're you doing here?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.292
I'm lying down
for what I believe in.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.228
Uh, good to see you,
Mr. Douglas.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.997
It's always good
to see you too, Trey.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.232
We need to talk.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.800
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.337
Um, Trey,
make some room for Dad.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.141
- Ow!
- Get up. C'mon. Jeez.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.409
- OK, OK.
- No, no, no, no. Not OK.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.012
We gotta get outta here now.
We're leavin' right now.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.882
As a member of
the Animal Rescue Group,
there are principles...

11:21.915 --> 11:24.417
You're a member
of the 11th grade.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.354
If you don't get out
of here right now,
I'm gonna ground you.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.824
Who's gonna enforce it?
You? You're never home.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.861
You're never gonna leave home
unless you leave here right now.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.698
[scoffs]
Come on, Trey.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.001
It was nice seeing you.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.770
You too, Trey.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.438
- [barks]
- OK.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.009
Yeah, this one still
freaks me out. A lot.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.278
Can't make an omelet
without breakin' some eggs.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.881
- That's a good point.
- Let's get a sample.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.182
OK.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.918
Such a good dog.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.788
Never give us
any trouble, do you?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.225
Nice.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.200
Oh, my God, it's a trap.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.903
- [barking]
- Dogs don't set traps.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.471
Yeah, well, dogs
don't live 300 years either.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.741
- [growling]
- [woman] Get the cattle prod.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.211
OK. That's what I'm doing,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.213
backing up to get
the cattle prod. I have it.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.315
- [electricity crackling]
- [barking]

12:30.784 --> 12:32.052
[woman] Watch out.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.053
That blood's viral.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.421
Aah!

12:40.093 --> 12:43.230
He treats me like
a ten-year-old.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.299
- What are you thinking?
- That we can prove
Mr. Forrester's right.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.937
- You wanna sneak in?
- Just follow me.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.209
[snoring]

13:03.050 --> 13:04.117
It's the middle
of the day.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.887
And if anyone asks, we're
just looking for a bathroom.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.456
- [barks]
- [gasps]

13:09.489 --> 13:11.424
[grunts]

13:11.458 --> 13:14.294
- [Carly] I knew it.
- [barks]

13:16.029 --> 13:17.330
Let's go.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.000
[car engine starting]

13:23.236 --> 13:25.205
We did it. We proved
Mr. Forrester's right.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.940
They are testing
animals in there.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.042
All right, so then,
what do we do now?

13:29.076 --> 13:33.613
We'll take him to the media and
show them we've got this dog...

13:33.646 --> 13:36.616
...who's got
no tags or markings

13:36.649 --> 13:40.487
that we can actually prove
came from Grant & Strictland.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.956
Well, can we take him
to your dad?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.457
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.459
And, uh, as deputy DA,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.128
he'll arrest us
for burglary.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.230
[barks]

13:50.263 --> 13:53.166
- We've searched the building.
- But we're gonna keep looking.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.567
- Really?
- We're gonna... Yes.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.037
Same places or new places?
If the same places...

13:57.070 --> 14:00.173
- I think new places.
- Oh, yeah? Tell me
you're a moron.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.341
- Definitely.
- Larry.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.176
- Yes?
- Don't... don't speak.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.213
Do you understand
the great lengths I went
to to get this dog? Yes?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.215
- [whispering] Yeah.
- Yes-or-no question.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.549
Well, you said
not to speak...

14:09.582 --> 14:12.485
And just 'cause he holds
the key to my future...

14:12.519 --> 14:15.155
...so it would stand to reason
that if you don't find him,

14:15.188 --> 14:17.925
well, [chuckles]
you won't have a future.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.893
Right.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.494
Why are you still
standing here?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.231
No sleeping.
No talking. Find him.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.566
[Dave] Hey,
sorry I'm late, guys.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.002
- Where's my dinner?
- [all] In the microwave.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.170
Right.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.605
So you guys see the trial
on the evening news?

14:34.241 --> 14:37.044
Great shot of your dad
on channel eight. [chuckles]

14:37.077 --> 14:40.347
So how was the parent-teacher
conference today?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.015
[water running]

14:42.049 --> 14:43.216
[sighs]

14:44.217 --> 14:45.352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.621
I... [sighs]
Completely slipped my...

14:50.123 --> 14:52.092
[whimpers]

14:52.125 --> 14:55.195
There's a dog
in the kitchen.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.897
No, no, no, no.
It's a dog-free home.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.599
[Carly] Dad,
stop oppressing Shaggy!

14:59.632 --> 15:02.235
- He's got a name now?
- Yeah, it just happened.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.937
He's so cute,
and he's very smart.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.106
They're a breeding
ground for fleas.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.642
They don't contribute
anything to the financial
well-being of a household.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.411
And I'm not gonna get...
Oh!

15:11.444 --> 15:14.281
It was an accident.
He's really sweet once
you get to know him.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.216
- Honey, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.152
Carly, this is precisely why,
no matter what happens,

15:19.186 --> 15:21.921
that animal's goin' back
to wherever he came from.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.992
[dog whimpering]

15:25.025 --> 15:27.527
Look at that.
He's paper-trained.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.464
All right, um,
come here. Ow!

15:31.498 --> 15:32.966
Oh! Aah!

15:33.000 --> 15:35.268
[echoing]

15:47.114 --> 15:48.481
Ow!

15:48.515 --> 15:50.450
- You scared him.
- Ow, he bit me.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.585
- [Rebecca] Let me see.
- [Dave grunts]

15:52.619 --> 15:56.323
Aww. He's licking it better.
What could be more sweet?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.426
So no hard feelings, right?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
[pants]

16:01.461 --> 16:04.264
- Thanks, guys.
- [Josh] He licked you!
He tried to apologize!

16:04.297 --> 16:07.200
You know what?
In our house, a lick is
not considered an apology.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.003
Well, if he doesn't have rabies,
can we take him back?

16:13.006 --> 16:14.307
[grunts]

16:16.143 --> 16:19.012
- [sighs]
- Hey.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.115
How's your hand?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.017
[slurring] Uh, fine, thanks.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.189
- What?
- Why are you talkin'
like that?

16:29.222 --> 16:32.292
I don't...
[stammers]

16:32.325 --> 16:34.661
I don't know. Huh.

16:34.694 --> 16:39.232
So Josh's teacher
called me today at work
when you didn't show.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.301
I am so sorry about that.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.303
He's flunking math.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.471
You're kidding.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.208
Josh knows he can't
play football unless
he passes math.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.244
I'll... I'll...
Don't worry, I'll... I'll...

16:51.278 --> 16:54.814
I'll... I'll talk
to him or somethin'.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.350
She also asked if there
were any problems at home.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.619
Yeah, that's good.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.090
I told her that we'd
reverted to cannibalism

17:03.123 --> 17:05.358
and that we were eating
our neighbors.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.694
OK, great.
I'd say the same thing.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.666
What?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.669
What happened to my husband?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.106
Let's not exaggerate
the situation.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.540
Dave!

17:20.573 --> 17:24.077
You were bitten tonight
by a stray dog, and the kids
took the dog's side.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.680
What does that tell you?
You don't know what's going on
with your own children.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.682
You don't know
what's going on with me.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.152
When was the last time
you even said, "I love you"?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.255
I love you.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.358
That doesn't count.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.227
Rebecca. Wait a minute.
Rebecca, stop.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.629
Stop for a second.
Please, look.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.631
That didn't come out
right. Turn around.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.367
Look,
sit down, sit down.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.369
I got an idea.
I got an idea.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.304
Tomorrow night I'm gonna
come home early,

17:51.338 --> 17:55.142
I'm gonna cook dinner
for the kids, spend some
quality time with them.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.576
And you know
what the next night is.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.879
- Do you?
- Yes. It's our anniversary.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.284
So we make
reservations at Grace,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.820
get that table by
the window that we love.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.824
I'll sing in French,
like you know that I can't do.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.497
You have to do more
than just talk a good game.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.267
- You have to
follow through, OK?
- Yeah.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.735
You have to connect
with the whole family again.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.104
[whispering] I love you.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.109
[grunting] Oh.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.111
I gotta get this.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.547
- Ahh.
- [grunting, sighs]

18:38.785 --> 18:40.420
[bicycle bell rings]

18:40.453 --> 18:44.191
- [beeping]
- [sighing] Mmm.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.531
Honey?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.201
Rough night's sleep?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.738
[sighs] No.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.377
[grunting, squeaking] No.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.815
- I slept great.
- Wow.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.688
I dreamt I chased cars
all night.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.191
- [Rebecca] Oh.
- Yeah.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.693
Hey, you know
what we should do?

19:20.727 --> 19:22.629
We should get out today.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.399
Get out, just go outside,
go to the... [stammers] go...

19:32.539 --> 19:34.307
We should go to the park.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.510
We should go to the park
and just run, huh?

19:57.364 --> 20:00.567
[high-pitched noise]

20:02.869 --> 20:05.372
* Greased lightnin'
Go greased lightnin' *

20:05.405 --> 20:07.374
* Go greased lightnin'...

20:07.407 --> 20:09.809
- [door opens]
- [music playing in headphones]

20:10.810 --> 20:11.944
Turn that down, please.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.913
Dad, don't you ever knock?

20:13.946 --> 20:15.548
I can hear that
all the way in my room.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.550
That high-pitched...
What...? Turn it...

20:17.584 --> 20:19.352
The machine,
turn the machine off.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.788
- [noise squealing]
- [groans] Oh.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.956
Great.
I hear everything.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.027
Beautiful day
out there now.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.430
I smell bacon and syrup.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.932
Wow. [sniffs]

20:32.965 --> 20:34.567
Ahh. [laughs]

20:34.601 --> 20:35.868
I smell everything today.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.904
[sniffs] I smell apples,
which are over here

20:37.937 --> 20:39.772
and fresh fruit and...
[sniffs] Lemon.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.375
Well, of course, they put
lemon on the wood. [laughs]

20:42.409 --> 20:44.777
Little bit of turpentine
in there too. I can smell that.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.713
[sniffs] Ooh, what's that?
What's that?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.715
Do you sm...
[sniffs] Peanut butter?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.284
Wheat? No. Somethin' else
in there. [sniffs]

20:52.685 --> 20:55.755
No, it's bougainvillea...
No, uh, hyacinth, roses.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.391
What is going on
with your hair?

20:58.425 --> 21:00.427
Cedar. It's like wood.
It's...

21:00.460 --> 21:01.728
- My perfume?
- Yeah.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.663
- Did I put on too much?
- No, I like it.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.933
And that music, hear it?
Where's the music? Over there.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.302
Yeah.
I play it every day.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.304
High notes. [sighing]

21:11.338 --> 21:13.673
Those high notes, can you
hear those high notes?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.007
It's fantastic.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.410
Great smells,
great sounds, beautiful wife.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.913
The kitchen,
it's a paradise.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.015
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Dad.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.284
Hmm. [sniffs]

21:30.557 --> 21:32.592
It's hot. Bitter.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.661
Terrible coffee. Yuck.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.796
[sucking teeth] Hoo.

21:37.797 --> 21:42.369
[sniffing] Mmm. Mmm.

21:42.402 --> 21:46.373
Hey, your mom tells me
that your math grades are
fallin' a little bit, huh?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.307
Yeah, it's been
a pretty tough year.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.576
Yeah?

21:53.346 --> 21:56.783
[Josh] Guess I should
spend more time studying.

21:56.816 --> 22:01.388
I want you playin' football as
badly as you wanna play. But...

22:01.421 --> 22:02.822
[slurping, munching]

22:02.855 --> 22:04.991
...if you can't
keep your grades up,

22:06.092 --> 22:08.327
we're gonna have to
pull you outta football.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.510
Uh... I gotta run.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.019
- [grunting]
- Ooh!

22:33.052 --> 22:35.655
I love you.
Did that count?

22:35.688 --> 22:36.856
I don't know. Maybe.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.991
- [growls]
- [squeals]

22:39.025 --> 22:41.528
Gotta go. Bye, guys.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.899
Do you know what pruning is?
Is that a lost art?

22:46.933 --> 22:49.368
It is snipping,
not slashing.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.938
- [Baxter] These are your roses.
- [sniffing]

22:53.440 --> 22:55.708
Where's your commitment?

23:00.613 --> 23:03.983
I'm payin' you guys $300
a month. That's $10 a day.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.691
[growls] It's my yard,
my yard! My yard! My yard!

23:11.724 --> 23:14.561
My yard! It's my... My yard!
My yard, my yard, my yard!

23:14.594 --> 23:17.430
My yard! My yard, my yard,
my yard, my yard! My yard!

23:17.464 --> 23:18.865
My yard, my yard! My yard!

23:18.898 --> 23:21.734
[panting]

23:24.971 --> 23:26.706
Mornin', Baxter.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.741
[* The Rascals:
Beautiful Morning]

23:28.775 --> 23:31.478
* It's a beautiful morning

23:31.511 --> 23:33.546
* Aah

23:33.580 --> 23:37.950
* I think I'll go outside
for a while *

23:37.984 --> 23:42.955
* And just smile
Ooh-waa-aah *

23:42.989 --> 23:45.224
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

23:45.257 --> 23:47.159
[panting]

23:48.094 --> 23:51.631
* Ooh, wah-aah

23:52.699 --> 23:55.935
* Ooh...

23:55.968 --> 23:58.505
[Kozak] Security called me
in the middle of the night.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.939
That's when
I discovered the fire.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.775
Fortunately, though, the,
you know, sprinklers went off

24:02.809 --> 24:05.512
and put it out before it spread
to the rest of the building.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.681
Dr. Kozak, there's
a document I'd like you
to take a look at.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.950
- [Kozak] All right.
- Um...

24:15.054 --> 24:16.856
[Dave growls, bites paper]

24:31.203 --> 24:33.139
[growling]

24:34.140 --> 24:36.475
Mr. Douglas.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.281
Hmm. [clears throat]

24:42.314 --> 24:44.551
Hmm, well.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.787
Could you tell us
what that is?

24:47.820 --> 24:51.624
[Kozak] Yes. I'll just
dry it off, briefly,
first, if you don't mind.

24:51.658 --> 24:56.162
Uh, this is the company's
policy on animal testing.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.899
[Kozak] We perform only
noninvasive and humane tests,

24:59.932 --> 25:02.001
and, I might add,
none of which, none of it,

25:02.034 --> 25:03.836
occurs in the building
where the fire...

25:03.870 --> 25:06.072
Objection, Your Honor.
It has never been estab...

25:06.105 --> 25:08.841
[growling]

25:08.875 --> 25:12.511
[louder growl]

25:12.545 --> 25:13.846
[Judge] Mr. Douglas.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.516
- Mr. Douglas!
- [growling stops]

25:17.550 --> 25:20.887
Did you just growl
at opposing counsel?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.058
Mm. No, no.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.227
[coughs]
I need some water.

25:28.260 --> 25:32.098
[clears throat]
This carpet, I think,
has something going on.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.767
Do you need a brief recess?

25:34.801 --> 25:36.869
[Dave] No, thanks,
it just... [growls]

25:38.871 --> 25:41.540
- I don't need a re...
- Did you just growl at me?

25:41.574 --> 25:45.244
No, no, no.
I had somethin' caught
in my throat. [growls]

25:45.277 --> 25:47.246
- [mimics growl]
- [typing]

25:47.279 --> 25:50.216
[judge] One more outburst,
and I'm holding you in contempt.

25:50.249 --> 25:53.019
[barks] Silence! Quiet!
Whoo! [muffled]

25:53.052 --> 25:54.587
[gasps]

25:58.057 --> 26:02.061
I think I... I think I could
use a re... re... [growling]

26:03.663 --> 26:05.765
- Recess.
- [bangs gavel]

26:05.798 --> 26:07.299
[judge] Ten minutes!

26:13.806 --> 26:15.975
[sighing] Ooh.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.881
What's with my hair?

26:21.914 --> 26:25.618
Oh. What's wrong with me?
[growls] Growlin'.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.794
[panting]

26:39.832 --> 26:41.600
[smacks lips]

26:42.935 --> 26:43.936
Whoa.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.283
[chuckles] Hoo.

26:59.786 --> 27:03.022
Hey. Hey, yeah. Yeah.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.624
Yeah, that's a...

27:05.658 --> 27:09.261
That's, uh... That's, uh...

27:09.295 --> 27:11.130
That's weird.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.264
[sighs]

27:12.298 --> 27:14.266
Dave, what is going on?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.369
Lori, I am ill.
I am leaving.

27:17.403 --> 27:20.272
- I want you to tell the judge.
- Hey, Dave, channel eight.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.309
Just one question.
Is there any possible way
you can win this case?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.978
Dave, is Forrester guilty?
Is Forrester guilty?

27:27.980 --> 27:31.050
Well, he definitely
does not have rabies.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.852
Well, then,
what does it have?

27:32.885 --> 27:36.856
Ah, well, he has a silky coat
and a great disposition.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.391
[laughs] I tell ya,
that's one good dog.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.828
- Where is he?
- This way.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.734
- [growling]
- [meows]

27:50.737 --> 27:53.105
[dogs barking]

28:26.138 --> 28:27.406
You.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.708
- [panting]
- [Dave] Listen to me.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.778
Why'd you bite me?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.747
You meant to bite me,
didn't you?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.418
You did mean to bite me.
I can... I can hear you.

28:39.451 --> 28:42.889
I can hear you.
I can hear you. I can...

28:42.922 --> 28:45.357
- What?
- [barking]

28:45.391 --> 28:47.860
What do you want?
You and your buddy.

28:47.894 --> 28:51.063
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you want some of this?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.865
Is that what you want?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.367
- [dogs barking]
- [barks] Quiet!

28:55.401 --> 28:58.037
[echoing] Quiet, quiet!
All of you, quiet!

28:58.070 --> 29:01.073
I can hear all of you. Quiet!

29:01.107 --> 29:04.743
[Dave] Why did you bite me?
You bit me on purpose.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.745
You knew who I was,
didn't you?

29:06.779 --> 29:10.116
- [panting]
- You bit me because
you knew it was me.

29:10.149 --> 29:13.419
What's happening?
What's happening to me?

29:19.191 --> 29:22.194
- [barking]
- [heartbeat accelerating]

29:31.270 --> 29:33.973
- [growls]
- [whimpering]

29:36.042 --> 29:39.445
Wow. That felt weird.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.983
OK, don't just sit there.
I want answers.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.784
Why'd you bite me? Huh?

29:45.818 --> 29:46.953
[barks]

29:46.986 --> 29:48.587
What do you mean,
I'm an animal?

29:48.620 --> 29:50.957
Is that some sort
of lawyer crack?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.292
Wait a minute. Why is it
I understand you?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.394
- [keys jingling]
- Run from what?

29:58.064 --> 30:00.299
- Hey there.
- How'd you get out?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.001
Well, you let me in here.

30:02.034 --> 30:05.171
Wow. You're taller
than I remember.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.473
- What are you doin'
with that stick?
- Come here!

30:07.506 --> 30:09.508
- [Dave] Hey!
- [ripping]

30:11.243 --> 30:13.112
Uh-oh.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.617
Why am I runnin'
on all fours? Thank you.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.120
Man, am I flyin'!

30:21.153 --> 30:24.023
Why'd I ever run on two?

30:24.056 --> 30:25.491
This is weird.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.160
[stammers] What's hittin' me
in the face? What is that?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.562
- It's my tongue.
- [tongue smacking]

30:30.596 --> 30:33.499
I can taste my own eyeball.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.871
- Aw, man.
- Hi there.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.208
Hoping you can help us.

30:42.241 --> 30:46.078
Um, our dog wandered off.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.485
Back the truck up.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.521
Look at that.

30:55.554 --> 30:59.525
That's that new
42-inch plasma.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.227
What is that?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.429
Is that me?

31:03.462 --> 31:07.066
It's impossible.
That can't be me.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.035
[barks]
I'm barking now?

31:09.068 --> 31:11.437
Did someone knock me out
and put me in a dog costume?

31:11.470 --> 31:14.573
Right. 'Cause that happens
all the time.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.943
I get it.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.511
I'm, uh...
I'm dreaming. Yeah.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.381
In about five seconds,
I'll be naked in the courtroom.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.918
[barks] I've gotta
wake myself up.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.686
Yeah. Wake myself up.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.021
Oh!

31:29.055 --> 31:32.258
[groans] That hurt.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.561
So I'm not dreaming,
I'm not in a dog costume,

31:35.594 --> 31:38.697
which can only mean
one thing. I'm a dog.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.367
[barks] Weirder things
have happened.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.036
I am a dog! [echoing]

31:44.070 --> 31:48.140
Perfectly understandable,
everybody. I'm a dog!

31:48.174 --> 31:50.977
I am a dog!

31:52.678 --> 31:55.914
- [man] Is this him?
- [Larry] That is him.
That is him.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.483
You are a lifesaver.
Thank you.

31:57.516 --> 32:01.053
- [Gwen] Mm-hmm.
- Our kids have been
crying all day.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.654
- [both] Aww.
- Can we take him now?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.257
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Right now.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.462
Please be home, please be home,
please be home, please be home.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.565
[barks] Hey, Tom, hey, Mary.
Tom? Mary?

32:13.599 --> 32:16.468
Please be home, please be home,
please be home, please be home.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.105
[panting] There we go.
All right!

32:21.507 --> 32:23.675
[barking]

32:25.111 --> 32:26.945
What's going on?
I can't open this.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.148
Come on, Dave,
grab and turn, grab and turn.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.152
How do dogs do anything
with these?

32:34.486 --> 32:36.488
[doorbell rings]

32:37.689 --> 32:39.425
- [barks] Hi!
- Shaggy, you're back!

32:39.458 --> 32:42.428
No, I'm... I'm not Shaggy.
I'm Dad.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.664
Carly, you gotta help me.
Must've been that dog bite.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.367
When the dog bit me,
I turned into Shaggy.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.669
- [laughs]
- Why is that funny?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.604
Gosh, you're talkative,
aren't you?

32:52.638 --> 32:55.441
Oh, that feels good.
That feels good.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.609
Oh, you're so cute.
I know. How ya doin'?

32:57.643 --> 33:00.546
Oh, wow. That is so good.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.182
But wait! Wait, wait, wait!
This is important!

33:03.215 --> 33:04.450
Hey, it's Shaggy!

33:04.483 --> 33:06.352
- Where'd he come from?
- I don't know.

33:06.385 --> 33:07.786
No, no, no, no, no.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.456
No, no. Listen to me.
Listen. I'm your dad.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.623
[Josh chuckles]

33:11.657 --> 33:14.126
Wow, he's really
hyper today.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.329
[through barks]
I am your dad.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.731
[Carly] Hey, do you need
to do your business?

33:19.765 --> 33:23.535
Business? Did my daughter
just ask me if I wanted
to use the bathroom?

33:23.569 --> 33:25.537
Wait a minute.
They can't hear me.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.573
All they hear is barking.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.242
I got an idea.
Here. Over here.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.078
Follow me.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.584
Watch, you guys.
Let's see. I... I am...

33:38.617 --> 33:40.552
Shaggy, no! Bad doggy!

33:40.586 --> 33:42.588
I am Dad. I am Dad.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.156
I need a "D."
A "D"...

33:44.190 --> 33:45.757
- Shaggy, stop.
- What are you doing?

33:45.791 --> 33:50.329
[Dave] Stop. What are you
doing? Quit cleanin' up!

33:50.362 --> 33:53.332
Sixteen years,
not once have you tried
to clean up your room.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.735
But when Dad turns into
a dog, you're right there
cleanin' everything up.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.704
- That's Janey. I gotta go.
- Where you goin'?

33:58.737 --> 34:01.607
- [sighs] You promise you
won't tell Mom and Dad?
- Yeah.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.209
I don't like the
sound of this.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.844
- I'm getting a tattoo.
- What?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.547
Janey knows this place
where they don't ask for ID,

34:08.580 --> 34:11.783
and I'm gonna get the
Animal Rescue Group logo
tattooed right across...

34:11.817 --> 34:14.186
- I don't think so!
- Shaggy, where are you going?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.455
Hey, Carly, hurry up!

34:16.487 --> 34:19.525
Oh! Who's the cute doggy?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.360
Who's the...?
[stammers] Whoa, boy.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.228
[Janey] Whoa, boy.
Whoa, boy.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.231
- [Dave growling]
- Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa!

34:25.264 --> 34:27.565
[screaming]

34:28.833 --> 34:31.803
- Shaggy, don't!
- Janey! Janey! Listen to me!

34:31.837 --> 34:34.139
How could you do this?
You're a good girl!

34:34.172 --> 34:36.275
You went to church camp!

34:36.308 --> 34:38.643
[tires squealing]

34:41.112 --> 34:44.382
Shaggy, what's gotten
into you? Bad dog!

34:44.416 --> 34:46.217
Don't use that tone
with me.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.388
You're grounded, young lady.
You are grounded.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.389
He's kind of freaking me
out a little.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.092
- What?
- Maybe we should take
him back to the pound.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.262
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll be good.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.764
Look, I'm good! Look at this.
Hey, look how good I am.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.399
Look who's a good doggy.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.401
- [laughs]
- This is humiliating.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.736
He probably just needs
to run around a little.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.306
I just ran five miles to get
here. I don't need a run.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.907
I know, I'll take him
to the dog park.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.909
No, I have stuff to do,
important stuff.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.579
I'm not going
to a dog park.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.614
- [sniffing]
- [barking in distance]

35:22.854 --> 35:27.159
Is there anyone
in this entire park
who has not sniffed my butt?

35:27.193 --> 35:30.596
No, no, no. Thanks,
I don't wanna sniff
your butt. Maybe later.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.631
I just want some answers.

35:32.664 --> 35:36.702
Has anybody here ever heard of
a human being turning into a...?

35:36.735 --> 35:38.604
- [Josh] Hey, Shaggy, hey, hey!
- What?

35:38.637 --> 35:41.940
- Wanna play with the Frisbee?
- Josh, I am not playing Fris...

35:41.973 --> 35:43.475
I got it!

35:46.745 --> 35:49.147
- Yes! I nailed it!
- Awesome!

35:50.649 --> 35:53.285
- Josh.
- Oh, hey, Tracy.
How's it goin'?

35:53.319 --> 35:55.621
- Where were you today?
- What do you mean?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.523
Auditions for Grease.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.492
[Dave] That instinct
is really intense.
It's like insane.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.628
Hey, I got a dog.
Pretty cool, huh?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.896
Here you go. Keep the Frisbee.
I'll be right back.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.233
I gotta talk to
those other... I got it!

36:08.934 --> 36:10.536
Nothin' but mouth!

36:10.569 --> 36:12.971
I'm not doin'
the musical this fall.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.342
- What?
- I, you know, just don't wanna.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.877
[mock laughs]
Funny. You're cute.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.913
Be at the theater
tomorrow, 3:00.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.916
And, uh, don't get too cocky.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.185
Just 'cause you're the best

36:27.219 --> 36:29.221
doesn't mean you're
gonna get the part.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.524
- Ow.
- [woman] Come on, kids!

36:32.558 --> 36:34.593
Did you see that catch,
Josh? That was great.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.796
- Way up in the air...
Hey, what's the matter?
- [Josh sighs]

36:52.711 --> 36:54.713
[barks, whimpers]

36:54.746 --> 36:57.716
You were
a very bad dog.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.751
Are you gonna be
a good boy?

37:03.489 --> 37:07.659
- You get the cattle prod,
I'll get the needle.
- OK.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.765
[barking]

37:22.073 --> 37:23.442
[door opens]

37:23.475 --> 37:24.910
So when was Dad
supposed to be home?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.812
- [door closes]
- 'Bout an hour ago.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.715
Hey, honey.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.551
Honey, uh, remember
that "in sickness
and health" thing?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.887
- What's for dinner?
- Well, your father was
supposed to be cooking.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.890
At least he said he was,
last time he returned
one of my phone calls.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.460
[Dave] Oh, boy,
that's the mad face.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.829
You smell mad.
Are you in heat?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.764
[Carly] Did you check
your e-mail?

37:45.797 --> 37:48.266
The computer.
That's it. That's it!

37:48.300 --> 37:49.735
- [chuckles] All right.
- Shaggy!

37:49.768 --> 37:51.837
Where are you going?

37:59.445 --> 38:01.813
[Dave] OK, um,
I can't make dinner...

38:01.847 --> 38:03.915
[Carly] Shaggy,
stop causing trouble.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.017
What's a shorter word
for metamorphosis?

38:06.051 --> 38:08.354
All right. Look,
I can't make dinner...

38:08.387 --> 38:11.923
I can't make dinner
because I turned into
a d... Don't shut that!

38:11.957 --> 38:13.959
Hey, watch this.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.995
Who does this remind you of?

38:17.028 --> 38:19.331
Wow. Maybe he escaped
from the circus.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.599
- [chuckles]
- C'mon, kids.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.669
Try to see past the fur
and the tail, the snout
and the drool.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.004
[chuckles] How cute.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.107
Honey, you recognize me.
Honey?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.543
Do you guys think your dad
is gonna come through,

38:31.577 --> 38:32.944
or should we go ahead
and order in?

38:32.978 --> 38:34.480
[in unison] Let's order in.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.048
Ouch.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.455
Well, I would let you
sleep inside, Shaggy.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.392
But my husband
won't allow it.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.326
Now, there's a bitter irony.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.628
Good night.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.664
Wait. Wait. Honey?
[barking]

38:52.698 --> 38:54.633
I'm sorry about tonight.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.768
I love you.
[growls]

39:00.606 --> 39:01.840
Sweet dreams.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.415
Really do love you.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.722
[heartbeat thumping]

40:18.116 --> 40:20.118
[floor creaking]

40:22.988 --> 40:25.591
- It's 3am.
- [clears throat]

40:25.624 --> 40:28.093
Where have you been?
What happened
to your clothes?

40:28.126 --> 40:32.598
Clearly you're upset,
and I would be upset too.
But there's...

40:32.631 --> 40:35.934
There's a simple
but hard-to-swallow
explanation for all this.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.004
[sighs]
I turned into a dog.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.172
[chuckles]

40:50.115 --> 40:52.150
Lori, I wanna thank you

40:52.183 --> 40:55.186
for picking up my car
at the animal shelter.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.589
I figured you were getting
it fixed. [chuckles]

40:57.623 --> 41:00.926
- Ooh.
- Um, no thanks necessary.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.094
Is there anything else I
can do for you this morning?

41:03.128 --> 41:06.698
- Actually, I need
some research done.
- Oh, OK. Great. On what?

41:06.732 --> 41:09.467
On dogs and man.
Man and dog... [stammers]

41:09.501 --> 41:13.004
Have you ever heard of a man
turning into a dog?

41:13.038 --> 41:14.973
Well, they all do
eventually, don't they?

41:15.006 --> 41:16.808
[laughing]

41:16.842 --> 41:18.544
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

41:18.577 --> 41:21.547
Dog-men. I'm on it.
Um, do you mind
if I ask why?

41:21.580 --> 41:24.482
- It would be better
if you didn't.
- Right, OK.

41:25.684 --> 41:28.053
I'll be honest,
the reports of your behavior

41:28.086 --> 41:30.021
in court yesterday
were unsettling.

41:30.055 --> 41:33.124
As was your disappearing
the rest of the day.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.861
Yeah, I know. And I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.629
I had some kind
of food poisoning.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.165
- I was mildly delirious.
- [elevator bell dings]

41:41.533 --> 41:43.168
- You goin' down?
- Yeah.

41:44.536 --> 41:47.072
- [sighs]
- Hold it.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.681
[growls]

41:55.714 --> 41:58.216
Should've taken
the stairs.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.218
- But you're fine now.
- Huh? Yeah, yeah.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.153
I'm great now,
thanks, Ken.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.155
- [dog whimpers]
- [Ken] Good.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.725
Because people don't
want a loose cannon

42:06.758 --> 42:08.727
workin' the DA's office.

42:09.795 --> 42:12.898
- Jeez.
- [dog whimpering]

42:12.931 --> 42:15.867
- [growling]
- [gasps]

42:17.869 --> 42:20.606
You ain't got
anything illegal
up there, do you?

42:21.873 --> 42:24.710
[laughing]

42:27.813 --> 42:29.347
[growling]

42:29.380 --> 42:31.249
By the way, Lloyd Gannon
called today

42:31.282 --> 42:34.552
about working on some
preliminary campaign ideas.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.622
Sit.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.891
He wants to go
grassroots to start.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.693
Mailers,
some door hangers,

42:41.727 --> 42:43.862
- then work up to
television and radio.
- Mm-hmm.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.564
[whimpering, growling]

42:48.634 --> 42:50.268
[clears throat]

42:50.301 --> 42:52.838
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.074
Yeah. [sighs]

42:57.342 --> 42:59.911
[panting]

43:01.146 --> 43:03.915
[mumbling] Oh...

43:03.949 --> 43:05.717
[pants]

43:05.751 --> 43:07.585
[elevator bell dings]

43:10.656 --> 43:13.124
You sure you're OK
to go into court today?

43:13.158 --> 43:15.927
Yeah. Uh-huh.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.265
[pants]

43:23.034 --> 43:24.670
[gurgles] Oh.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.905
There were these
little bunnies.

43:26.938 --> 43:30.642
There... there were poor
little fluffy bunnies

43:30.676 --> 43:32.811
all crammed together
in a cage.

43:32.844 --> 43:35.013
[Dave] And you thought it was
a good idea to set a fire

43:35.046 --> 43:36.982
where there was
fluffy bunnies present?

43:37.015 --> 43:38.850
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

43:38.884 --> 43:41.987
Look, I didn't set the fire,
and I saw what I saw.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.321
How come we can't see
what you saw?

43:43.354 --> 43:46.692
Do we need special goggles
for this? Is this
like a Bigfoot affair?

43:46.725 --> 43:49.094
Objection! Your Honor!
He's badgering the witness!

43:49.127 --> 43:54.099
- Your Honor!
- I saw a monkey
who acted like a dog!

43:54.132 --> 43:55.934
[courtroom laughing]

43:55.967 --> 43:58.169
[judge] Counselors,
approach the bench.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.207
[Dave sniffs]

44:02.240 --> 44:04.242
[judge] Get over here!

44:08.313 --> 44:12.984
Don't you dare turn
my courtroom into a barnyard.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.955
Get your chin off my desk.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.324
- [whimpers]
- Go on. Go on.

44:22.027 --> 44:25.330
I assume you're going
somewhere with this line
of questioning?

44:25.363 --> 44:26.898
I'd like a treat first.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.869
Yes, yes, I was.
Thank you.

44:30.902 --> 44:33.972
- [judge] Proceed, counsel.
- [Dave] Thank you, Your Honor.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.907
How did this monkey
act like a dog?

44:35.941 --> 44:38.309
It was growling
and chasing its tail.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.411
[laughter]

44:40.445 --> 44:43.181
[Dave] Was there anything else
that was genetically odd?

44:43.214 --> 44:46.684
There was a snake
with a tail like a dog.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.754
- [laughter]
- [gavel pounds]

44:48.787 --> 44:51.289
And rats.
Rats that barked.

44:52.423 --> 44:55.193
- [judge pounds gavel]
- [Forrester] It's true!

44:56.261 --> 44:57.428
Look, it's true!

44:57.462 --> 45:00.165
I'm... I'm not lying!
I'm not crazy!

45:00.198 --> 45:02.868
[judge] Order! Order!

45:04.770 --> 45:08.874
This dog that you saw,
what did it look like?

45:08.907 --> 45:14.245
It was a big,
woolly sheepdog.

45:21.887 --> 45:24.422
- No further questions,
Your Honor.
- Thank God.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.058
- [judge] Court adjourned.
- [pounds gavel]

45:30.395 --> 45:31.797
[bell ringing]

45:31.830 --> 45:34.365
Josh was one
of my best math students,

45:34.399 --> 45:37.202
and then, all of a sudden...
[whistles]

45:37.235 --> 45:38.970
Bad grades.

45:39.004 --> 45:42.473
And so we're just
trying to search out
an explanation, really.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.276
Well, I think
the problem is he's
distracted by football.

45:45.310 --> 45:49.214
Can I...? I think I know
what the problem...
The problem, I think, is me.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.917
I've been workin' too much.
This is what this is all about.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.251
I haven't been home.
It's...

45:53.284 --> 45:56.054
It's been causing a lot
of stress on my family.

45:56.087 --> 45:59.324
[teacher] Well, I know
what it's like to be
too busy to do anything.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.492
In fact, I didn't even
get to eat lunch today.

46:01.526 --> 46:04.429
- Do you mind if I just
eat a little something?
- [chuckles] Sure.

46:04.462 --> 46:05.997
- [Dave] Go ahead.
- Thanks.

46:06.031 --> 46:08.466
I realized this
in court, actually.

46:08.499 --> 46:12.437
Uh, last couple days the...
the amount that I was in...

46:15.206 --> 46:17.275
[sniffing]

46:19.110 --> 46:22.447
Can you smell that?
It is so smelly in a great way.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.515
That is...
[echoing] turkey...

46:24.549 --> 46:27.018
- [lettuce crunching]
- [echoing] Mmm.

46:27.052 --> 46:31.156
Look at that. Ah, yeah.

46:32.223 --> 46:33.959
- [teacher] Do you want half?
- Hmm?

46:33.992 --> 46:35.160
C'mon, please?

46:36.294 --> 46:38.029
Uh, no.
Well, no, wait, no.

46:38.063 --> 46:40.531
No, we're here
to talk about Josh.

46:40.565 --> 46:43.101
Boy. Anyway,

46:43.134 --> 46:44.836
I'm just gonna
commit myself to this.

46:44.870 --> 46:46.938
There's nothing more
important than Josh.

46:46.972 --> 46:48.840
There's nothing more
important to me...

46:48.874 --> 46:50.942
Nothing more important
to me than family.

46:50.976 --> 46:52.944
- [smacks lips]
- [teacher] That's true.

46:52.978 --> 46:55.346
Oh, that's great.
I love hearing that. [chuckles]

46:55.380 --> 46:58.549
- You know, as a teacher,
I love to hear...
- [hisses]

46:58.583 --> 47:01.386
- Honey?
- [door closing, running]

47:01.419 --> 47:04.289
[stammers]
I'm so sorry. [laughs]

47:04.322 --> 47:06.557
I mean, he's... he's really
a wonderful father.

47:06.591 --> 47:08.894
You know, we just have
a very normal lifestyle.

47:08.927 --> 47:11.196
- Right. Yeah,
it just seems that way.
- [cat yowling]

47:11.229 --> 47:12.463
Very down-to-earth.

49:05.476 --> 49:07.979
- [panting]
- [heartbeat accelerates]

49:11.516 --> 49:13.618
Aw, nuts!

49:17.055 --> 49:18.456
- [cat meows]
- What?

49:18.489 --> 49:20.325
[yowls]

49:20.358 --> 49:23.328
Well, if ya didn't
do anything wrong,
why were you running?

49:24.462 --> 49:28.133
[laughs] Serves you right...
[grunts] Oh!

49:28.699 --> 49:30.468
Gotcha.

49:30.501 --> 49:32.503
This is just not my week.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.072
[whimpers]

49:41.012 --> 49:42.780
I think we've got it.

49:42.813 --> 49:46.217
- This rabbit was injected
with the serum two days ago.
- [Kozak] Uh-huh.

49:46.251 --> 49:49.420
So far cell degeneration has
ceased with no side effects.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.457
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.559
Are you absolutely,
entirely certain?

49:54.592 --> 49:56.061
Absolutely.

49:57.262 --> 49:59.330
- I've done it.
- Um, we've done it.

49:59.364 --> 50:02.567
I've done it! [laughs]
I'm gonna call Strictland.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.236
I bet he's gonna want
an injection of
this stuff right away.

50:05.270 --> 50:07.205
Can we do that?
Isn't there, like, an FDA?

50:07.238 --> 50:10.041
The man's got one lung
and someone else's
kidney. He'll risk it.

50:10.075 --> 50:13.211
Gwen, I want you
to manufacture as much
serum as you can.

50:13.244 --> 50:16.181
And don't worry about the FDA.
It's nothing money can't handle.

50:16.214 --> 50:17.482
[laughing]

50:17.515 --> 50:19.417
[dogs barking]

50:19.450 --> 50:22.253
- That's him.
- Kids! Boy, am I
glad to see you.

50:22.287 --> 50:26.224
This mastiff just sold me
for three biscuits.

50:26.257 --> 50:29.327
Where you been?
We've been lookin'
all over for you, boy.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.729
I've been waitin' for you guys
to come get me outta here.

50:31.762 --> 50:34.499
[Josh] Let's go. I got
a football game to go to.

50:34.532 --> 50:37.034
[Dave] There's
a game today? Wow!

50:37.068 --> 50:40.071
I... I get to watch you play.
That'll be great.

50:40.105 --> 50:41.038
[crowd cheering]

50:41.072 --> 50:42.673
- Get him!
- C'mon.

50:42.707 --> 50:46.111
- Hit him! Hit him!
- [referee blows whistle]

50:46.144 --> 50:49.280
[man] That's the way
to hit somebody, Jenkins.
Way to go.

50:49.314 --> 50:51.849
[Dave barking]

50:51.882 --> 50:53.851
[Dave] Hey, coach,
would ya put my kid in?

50:53.884 --> 50:56.221
We waited all game
for this.

50:56.254 --> 50:58.089
Douglas!

50:58.123 --> 50:59.290
You're in at tailback.

50:59.324 --> 51:01.226
[players laughing]

51:01.259 --> 51:03.094
Oh, it's OK, coach.
You don't have to play me.

51:03.128 --> 51:06.631
- What?
- Everybody plays,
Douglas. Come on.

51:06.664 --> 51:08.766
But with the game
on the line and all...

51:08.799 --> 51:11.702
We're up by 30.
Now let's go.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.604
- [woman] C'mon, buddy!
- All right.

51:13.638 --> 51:16.541
Get in. Come on, Josh.
Come on, buddy.
Get in there. C'mon.

51:16.574 --> 51:18.776
[grunts] Oh!
Sorry, coach.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.378
That's what I gotta
deal with.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.148
Show 'em what you can do.
Show 'em what you can do.

51:23.181 --> 51:25.550
[Dave] The other team's
afraid. I can smell it!

51:25.583 --> 51:29.220
And a hot dog.
And a poodle.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.722
[boy 1] I run.
Twenty-four dive, I run.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.558
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

51:33.591 --> 51:36.394
- [boy 2] All right!
- Where...? I go...?

51:36.427 --> 51:37.495
What the...?

51:37.528 --> 51:40.498
[coach] Douglas! Tailback!

51:40.531 --> 51:42.433
Tail...!
Behind the fullback!

51:42.467 --> 51:44.269
Back up! Back up!
Back up!

51:44.302 --> 51:46.804
Back! Back, back, back,
back, back! Right there!

51:46.837 --> 51:49.240
- Stay right there!
- [quarterback calls play]

51:49.274 --> 51:52.410
Set! Hut!

51:52.443 --> 51:55.713
- [boys] Block him!
- Here it comes!

51:56.947 --> 51:58.749
[coach] You got the ball!
Run! Run!

51:58.783 --> 52:00.518
Whoa!

52:00.551 --> 52:03.754
- [grunts]
- [crowd groans]

52:03.788 --> 52:05.756
- Ooh!
- Ow!

52:05.790 --> 52:09.360
- [blowing whistle]
- Man! That's gotta hurt.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.562
- [sighs]
- [coach] Hustle!

52:13.531 --> 52:16.267
[Dave] Attaboy, Josh.
Come on! Shake it off.

52:16.301 --> 52:18.536
Pain is just fear
leavin' your body, buddy.

52:18.569 --> 52:20.605
You completely suck,
Douglas.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.774
Why do you even show up?
Everybody thinks you're a loser.

52:23.808 --> 52:26.143
[barks, growls]

52:29.480 --> 52:31.816
Thanks, pal.

52:31.849 --> 52:33.784
Wish I could buy you
an ice cream.

52:33.818 --> 52:36.887
But I've got paws
and, uh, don't have a wallet,

52:36.921 --> 52:39.657
because I'm actually nude
right now.

52:42.260 --> 52:44.795
Football? That's why
you're not trying out?

52:44.829 --> 52:46.631
[chuckles] You hate football!

52:46.664 --> 52:49.534
Shh! I know,
but my dad loves it.

52:49.567 --> 52:53.638
[Josh] You should hear him.
"Ah, you're gonna be
just like your old man."

52:53.671 --> 52:56.307
If I told him I wanted
to do a musical instead,

52:56.341 --> 52:58.509
he'd, like,
write me off as a son.

52:58.543 --> 53:00.177
Aw, Josh.

53:00.211 --> 53:02.647
Josh, is your father
a stupid man?

53:02.680 --> 53:04.649
No. But he is clueless,

53:04.682 --> 53:08.253
- which, in some ways,
is better.
- Oh, boy.

53:08.286 --> 53:10.821
See, he told me I could only
play if I keep my grades up.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.490
So I started
flunking math.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.259
But he only let me
off with a warning.

53:14.292 --> 53:16.394
So now I gotta
flunk English

53:16.427 --> 53:18.696
and maybe history
and home ec,

53:18.729 --> 53:21.366
which is actually
really hard to fail.

53:21.399 --> 53:22.900
Aww, no, Josh.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.902
So you'd rather
wreck your future

53:24.935 --> 53:26.837
than tell your dad
you hate football?

53:26.871 --> 53:28.539
I can get
my grades back up,

53:28.573 --> 53:30.708
as long as he makes me
quit in time.

53:31.942 --> 53:33.544
[scoffs] Wow.

53:33.578 --> 53:35.880
Men are so complicated.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.617
- Come on.
- How did I let this happen?

53:39.650 --> 53:41.952
[stammers] What kind
of a father am I?

53:44.755 --> 53:47.725
[Carly] So? What do you think
of the new pamphlet?

53:47.758 --> 53:48.959
[Trey] It's infuriating.

53:48.993 --> 53:51.429
No, but in a good way.

53:51.462 --> 53:54.699
Makes me wanna get out there
and do something
about animal testing.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.534
That's the response
I was hoping for.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.704
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what're you doin' in
my daughter's bedroom?

53:59.737 --> 54:01.772
- You rock.
- [chuckles]

54:01.806 --> 54:03.641
Don't even
think about it, Trey.

54:03.674 --> 54:04.809
Shaggy, stop.

54:06.444 --> 54:08.379
What's that?

54:08.413 --> 54:09.714
That's really well-done.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.982
Admit it, this is way
more effective than a tattoo.

54:12.016 --> 54:13.918
One thing I learned
from Mr. Forrester

54:13.951 --> 54:16.554
is that just because
something seems ridiculous

54:16.587 --> 54:17.922
doesn't mean
that it's wrong.

54:17.955 --> 54:20.825
It just takes more courage
to stand up for it.

54:20.858 --> 54:23.394
Wow, you really believe
all of this.

54:23.428 --> 54:25.463
I am so proud of you.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.465
[giggles] Shaggy, stop.

54:27.498 --> 54:28.666
All right. Down, boy.

54:28.699 --> 54:31.469
Hey, easy
on the hands, bud.

54:31.502 --> 54:33.571
I mean, just imagine
what would have happened

54:33.604 --> 54:35.906
if we hadn't stolen Shaggy
from Grant & Strictland.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.909
You what? Stolen?!

54:38.943 --> 54:42.513
You stole a dog
from Grant & Strictland,
and you lied about it.

54:42.547 --> 54:43.914
Shaggy. Shaggy, c'mon.

54:43.948 --> 54:45.516
C'mon. Go fetch, boy.
C'mon, boy.

54:45.550 --> 54:47.084
I am not your boy,
and I'm not gonna go...

54:47.117 --> 54:48.953
- Go fetch.
- Hey, I'll be right back.

54:52.056 --> 54:54.925
[groans] I've got
to stop doing that.

54:54.959 --> 54:58.829
[Josh] * I've got chills
They're multiplyin' *

54:58.863 --> 55:03.368
* And I'm losin' control

55:04.802 --> 55:06.036
Keep goin'.

55:06.070 --> 55:09.306
What? Why're you
lookin' at me like that?

55:09.340 --> 55:12.343
Hey, you're pretty
darned good at this.

55:12.377 --> 55:13.778
Hey, let's order
some pizza.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.780
Mom and Dad
are out to dinner.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.782
Dinner. Oh, no.

55:17.815 --> 55:20.651
I forgot about
our anniversary!

55:25.022 --> 55:27.358
[woman clears throat]

55:27.392 --> 55:28.993
You should have
brought a book.

55:29.026 --> 55:31.529
The single woman's
best friend.

55:31.562 --> 55:34.999
Oh. [laughs]
I'm not single.

55:35.032 --> 55:37.535
Oh.

55:39.504 --> 55:41.639
Yet. [sighs]

I'm also a dog.

that you stood me up for

gonna get past this one.

Honey, no.
Please don't cry.

56:42.567 --> 56:45.102
It didn't used to be
like this, Shaggy.

56:45.135 --> 56:48.072
He used to be here
for everything.

56:48.105 --> 56:51.141
And if he couldn't be,
then he would call,

56:51.175 --> 56:53.778
or he would send a note
or flowers, or he'd...

56:53.811 --> 56:55.580

would write these...

how it ends? [sniffs]

and me hugging the dog?

57:12.597 --> 57:14.799

what happened to me,

Hey, Ken, thanks for s...

58:45.022 --> 58:46.991
Hey, hey, Dave.
It's three in the morning,

58:47.024 --> 58:49.827
and you want a warrant
to search Grant & Strictland.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.195
- Right.
- They're the victims.

58:51.228 --> 58:53.330
No. Listen, listen.
You gotta trust me on this.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.834
Kozak is hidin' somethin'.
Forrester was framed
for that arson.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.536
If Forrester was framed,
why did he throw in
the towel?

58:59.570 --> 59:02.106
What...? What're you
talking about?

59:02.139 --> 59:04.642
Forrester pleaded out.

59:06.243 --> 59:08.078
Well, why didn't somebody
tell me that?

59:08.112 --> 59:10.915
- 'Cause you're off the case.
- You can't do this.

59:10.948 --> 59:14.719
The jury convenes at ten
to hear Forrester's plea.
I'll handle it.

59:14.752 --> 59:17.855
And I want you
to either get your head
screwed on straight

59:17.888 --> 59:19.957
or find another job.
Is that clear?

59:19.990 --> 59:22.993

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.980
All right? Here.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:52.783
All right.
Throw the stick, over there.

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:54.284
Why would I
throw the stick?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.020
Just throw the stick,
please.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.855
Why would I
throw the stick?

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:01.125
Because I'll give you
$5 to throw the stick.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.661
Oh, I look like a guy
who needs 5 bucks.

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.298
Gimme the money.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.835
- Speed or distance?
- Uh, distance.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:28.185
[panting] It's so close.
It's close.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.820
This time, throw it

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:31.688
and... and yell, "Fetch!"

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.025
Don't make me bite ya.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.062
Fetch!

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:46.036
Wow. I can't believe
that worked. Thanks!

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.305
Whoa.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.744
[grunts]
Drop the stick.

01:01:53.778 --> 01:01:57.247
All right.
Perfect. Nice fit.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.219
[sniffs] That's it,
follow your nose.

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.890
Wait a minute. [sniffs]
What's that smell?

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.058
What is it?
Oh, it's me.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.041
[sighs]

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.742
The transistor.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:29.246
The microchip.
The artificial heart.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.083
All footnotes
compared to this.

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:35.252
[coughing]

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.294
[coughing]

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.496
Bingo.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.166
[coughs, wheezes]

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.015
- What's happening?
- He's going into shock.

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:06.416
It's the serum.
It doesn't work.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.418
- What do we do?
- Of course it works.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.155
I just didn't
give it to him.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.991
- What have you done to him?
- [Kozak] Lance? Lance?

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.994
I'm so sorry that
I had to do this to you,

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:21.031
but I just couldn't let you
take all the credit again.

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:24.001
And plus, you're a pig,
and I hate you.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:27.304
I hate you in so many ways.

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:30.941
Can you hold this
for a second?

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.542
Get rid of it,
accomplice.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.111
[gasps] Ah.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.947
But is he... dead?

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:40.284
No, he's not dead.
He's fully conscious,
but he's unable to speak.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:43.153
Doctors will think
it's dementia.

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:45.990
[Kozak] The drug itself
will wear off
in a few months.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:49.159
But by then I'll be CEO,

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.962
and I will be fabulously,

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:55.199
insanely,
unimaginably wealthy.

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.335
- This was not part
of the plan.
- This is totally wrong.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.570
Of course, I'll cut both
of you in on his share.

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:04.308
- I'm cool with that.
- It's fine by me.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.576
Good. Uh, Larry,

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:09.479
why don't you wheel him
up to his office,
park him at his desk.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.349
Or, uh, should I say,
my desk?

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.052
Oh, boy.
Gotta get outta here.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:17.187
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.390
- What was that?
- What was that?

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.893
I knew Kozak
was up to something.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.164
Carly was right
about everything.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.166
Forrester was framed.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.568
[barks] Uh-oh.

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:36.540
Looks like I'm walkin'.

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:42.947
- [Gwen] Wow.
- [Larry] That's somethin'.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.416
That's... Wow. Do you realize
the significance of that?

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.518
Wow. You think?

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.554
Yeah, I think it's
mildly significant.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.290
Unfortunately,
it's on tape.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.625
So we... [stammers]

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:59.696
[sighs] I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.267
You two are going to pay
Mr. Douglas a visit.

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:18.983
[sighs]

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:31.595
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:35.599
No, not my babies.
Not my darlings.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.334
Oh, evil.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.103
These hooligans! [grunts]

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:49.746
Where's Trey?
We're gonna be late for school.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.948
Shoulda gotten
a ride from Mom.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.120
What's the matter?

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:59.023
[sobs] Do you realize
what's happening?

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:01.691
Mom and Dad
are splitting up.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:03.460
How do you know?

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.030
[scoffs]
Josh, it's obvious.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.998
[doorbell rings]

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.303
- [barks]
- Shaggy.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.205
I just witnessed
an attempted murder.

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:17.441
Carly, you were right
about everything.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.610
An innocent man is about
ready to go to jail.
I gotta take a nap.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.312
Don't wake me
unless I'm human, OK?

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:24.214
I mean, did you see
that note he left?

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:26.150
"I'll explain
everything"?

01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:28.152
We're gonna get
the talk.

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:31.788
- What talk?
- The "Mom and Dad are
having problems" talk.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.458
Then Dad'll leave.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:38.462
[scoffs] They'll say it's
temporary, but it won't be.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.065
Are you sure you're not
just drama-queening?

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:44.168
Josh, he didn't even
come home last night.

01:06:45.169 --> 01:06:46.736
But if you ask me,

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:50.074
he stopped caring
a long time before that.

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:55.379
No, no, no, no.
No, that's not it.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:58.182
No, no, no.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.232
[Carly] Shaggy.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:20.104
Shaggy, would you stop
making such a...?

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.708
That's impossible.

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:30.447
Finally.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.386
How?

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:48.098
- [Josh] Grant & Strictland?
- Yes.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:51.701
Mr. Forrester said
they were making
mutant animals,

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:54.771
and... and that's
where I found Shaggy.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.574
And Shaggy bit Dad.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:01.445
- [whimpers]
- [gasps] Oh, Daddy!

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:04.148
It's OK, kiddo. It's OK.

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:07.417
[crying] I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:10.154
Can you please forgive me?

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:12.256
There's nothin' to forgive.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.593
[crying]

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.595
I'm gonna go call Mom.

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:24.401
So you saw the game
yesterday?

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.502
Yeah.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:29.238
I didn't want to let you down,
but I'm just no good.

01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:32.309
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You are good.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.345
- [ringing]
- Come on, come on.

01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:46.356
Josh? This...

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.492
There we go.
Lemme get in here.

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:56.433
Do this.
This is what you love.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.703
'Cause if you keep
playin' football,
you're gonna get hurt.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:01.770
Thanks, Dad.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.640
And somethin' else.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.946
I know, I know.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.948
- Deal?
- It's a deal.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.518
Mom, it's Carly.

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.520
Call me back as soon as
you get this message. Bye.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:19.889
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.292
Somebody's peein'
on the lawn!

01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:25.362
Nobody makes it on my lawn
and gets away with it!

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.897
I'm gonna...
[grunts] Oh!

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.500
Oh!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.540
[woozy] Clean up
on aisle three.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:39.243
Price check
on dog biscuits.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.877
OK. Hi, Mr. Douglas.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.647
- Who are you?
- How are ya?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.682
[growls]

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.819
[mumbling] Wait a second.
I don't...

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.756
I don't feel so good.

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:55.592
- Dad!
- Dad! Daddy!

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.561
- Hit it.
- Yeah, OK.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:01.931
[tires squeling]

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:14.344
I'm sorry you're a dog.
I am.

01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:18.915
Also, very sorry that you
won't be leaving here alive.

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:22.686
People will be wondering
where you've disappeared to.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.521
Then again...

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.756
...dogs do wander off.
[chuckles]

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.893
I can't believe
you think you're gonna
get away with this, Kozak.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.862
Nonetheless,
before you die,

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.865
we're going to want
to run some tests on you.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.968
Eenie, meenie, minie,
cut you, hurt you, ow,

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.937
your nose is coming off.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.807
Because we just don't
understand how you
turned into him.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.876
- [barks]
- I'm very excited.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:50.547
I just can't wait to get
inside that body of yours
and just poke around.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.248
Aah!

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.618
Oh, you filthy
little mongrel!

01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:57.654
[blows, pants]
That wasn't very nice.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.255
Ooh, that hurt, didn't it?

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.758
Gonna have to work on that
attitude when I get back.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.930
Meanwhile, we are gonna
run upstairs for a minute.

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:10.834
It seems Dr. Strictland
is having a bit of
a health crisis.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.403
And after that,
we're off to court

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:17.607
to watch Justin Forrester
back down to save
his own skin.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:21.611
Be back to cut you up
like a birthday cake later.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.650
[chittering]

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:29.786
Huh. Who are you, anyway?

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:31.287
[barking]

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.856
[Dave] Tibet. Really.

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:35.592
Well, let me ask you this:
[barking]

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.494
Why did you bite me?

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:41.297
And turning me into a dog
would help you... how?

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:42.666
[whimpers]

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:45.301
I guess you didn't think
about that, did you?

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:47.704
[barking, chittering]

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.874
Well, I turn into a human
when I sleep,

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:52.809
but there's no time
for that now, is there?

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.611
There's gotta be another way.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.580
[barking]

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.315
Meditation?

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:07.391
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Get in and drive.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:12.829
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad's been dognapped.
Go, go!

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.534
[Dave] Inhale, exhale.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.736
I got to get
my heart rate down.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.639
[inhales, exhales]

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:23.840
I'm on a beach.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:27.377
[echoing] Inhale, exhale.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:30.013
Surrounded by
fire hydrants.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:33.383
[deep breathing]

01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:35.652
Food everywhere.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.688
Slow rolling waves of gravy,

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:41.458
crashing onto the shore.

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:52.402
The beached whale
made of peanut butter.

01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:54.438
[heartbeat slowing]

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:08.885
[Dave] It worked.

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:11.688
It worked. Great.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.890
- [barks]
- I'm back.
It's good, it's good.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:15.725
[howling]

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:21.465
- New problem. New problem.
- [barks]

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:24.434
[Dave] Yeah. I've got
to get those keys.

01:13:24.468 --> 01:13:26.402
Now if I could just
get over there.

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:29.405
OK. Yeah. Go. Go.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:31.007
- Go.
- [creaking]

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.710
Oh, no.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.479
No, no, no, no, no...
Oh!

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:37.947
Oh! Oh.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:40.149
[grunting] Oh.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:42.051
Oh, boy. OK.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.620
Who's got a plan?

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.824
Snake! Do they have ears?

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.059
- [barking]
- Can you hear me?

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.562
- [barks]
- Don't need to show
that hood at me.

01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:54.731
You better watch
'cause it's gonna fall over.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:57.734
- All right, monkey.
- [hooting]

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.736
Sorry, chimp.
You gotta push.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.804
On three, ready?

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:04.674
One, two, three. Push!

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:10.113
Harder this time.
One, two, three. Push!

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:13.016
[Dave] I need some help
from the rabbits.
You gotta hop into this.

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:15.852
One, two, three. Hop!

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:18.154
Aw, ya almost got it.
Ya almost got it.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.657
All right, one more time.
We got a big one. Here we go.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.793
One, two, three. Hop!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.500
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!

01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:32.168
[hooting]

01:14:35.739 --> 01:14:38.675
[Dave] Yo, snake!
Walk, skirt...

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.810
Do what...
Uh, you know, slither.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:45.481
Go, go, go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:48.852
Yeah, yeah.
Thattaboy, Thattaboy!

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:50.486
Do you see where it is?

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.955
'Course you do. Perfect.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.824
Stretch. Reach up.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.826
Up there, up there.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.895
That's it, that's it, that's it.

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:02.065
[Dave chuckles]

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:06.169
Beautiful.

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:10.574
Yes! We're outta here!

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:13.877
[all barking]

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.984
[grunts] Up, up.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:23.820
- [Dave grunts]
- [barks]

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.755
Yes! You're next.

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:28.892
Follow the dog.

01:15:28.925 --> 01:15:32.829
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:33.830
Up there. Go!

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.264
Take care of the rabbit.

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:36.866
- [gas hissing]
- [belches]

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.868
[Dave] Get it? Help him out.

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:41.070
Easy, easy. Come here.

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:44.974
Good. [grunts] There you...
Come on. Go, go, go.

01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:50.947
- [croaks]
- Come here. Come here.
Come on.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.349
Come here.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.685
[grunting] Jeez.

01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:57.220
What have you been eatin'?

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.125
- [barks]
- [Dave] Sorry about that.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.628
All right, up here.
Up here. Up...

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:08.264
Boy, you're heavy
for a snake.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:12.068
Come on. Oh! Oh! Uh!

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:18.708
Ooh, yeah.
That's creepy. That's...

01:16:18.742 --> 01:16:21.978
That's creepy.
Whoo. All right.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:25.148
[Dave] It's a left, a left,
a right and a left.

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:26.650
Just go towards the light.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.952
I'll meet you guys
out there.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:31.955
[electricity crackling]

01:16:34.824 --> 01:16:36.726
- Nice.
- Thank you.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.895
[barking]

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.764
[howls]

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:51.274
There he is! Look!

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.743
Come here!
Come on, Dad! Come on!

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:56.746
Come on, let's go!

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.082
We won't let them
get away with it.
Don't worry, Daddy.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.784
- [barking]
- That's right, Dad.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:11.327
You know, you guys seem
like nice young people
with great futures.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.698
You know that I'm
the deputy district attorney.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:16.700
Kidnapping
is a capital crime.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:18.835
You just can't lock
people in cages, guys.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:22.772
Yeah, there's
a definite... line
we're crossing here.

01:17:22.806 --> 01:17:24.974
We crossed that line
a long time ago, Larry.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:26.375
[Gwen] Deal with it.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.285
You know, you're not
gonna get away with this.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.387
Now...

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.792
...you be a good little doggy
and do just what we say.

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:45.094
[electricity crackling]

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:52.135
Doesn't feel so good
to get zapped, does it?
Attaboy, chimp!

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.403
Good, now get over here
and get me out of here.

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:56.239
Come on.
Put that thing down.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:00.176
- [barking]
- Please don't be mad,
Daddy.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:04.347
Don't worry, Dad.
We're gonna take you to Mom
and explain everything.

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:08.317
[sighs] He's really angry.

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.019
[animals chittering]

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.154
All right. We gotta go.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:14.157
Do you know which way
the door is?

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.926
All right. Good, good, good.
Which way?

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:20.296
- Are you sure?
- [monkey chitters]

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:25.334
I like the dark travertine
better. What do you think?

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.270
I agree, I agree.
I'll push for that one.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.504
- Yeah.
- OK, good.

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.306
[barking]

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:35.044
Could you just excuse me
for a minute? I...

01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:37.346
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.382
It's tough bein'
a single mom.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:42.185
[sighs] I'm not
a single mom.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.920
[Carly] Mom,
we need to talk.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:46.756
Why aren't you guys in school?
And why is Shaggy here?

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.457
It's not a dog.
It's Dad.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:53.029
I thought we were going
to break it to her slowly.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:56.032
Grant & Strictland's
been doing all these
weird animal tests.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:59.035
So when Shaggy bit Dad,
he turned into a dog.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.737
- Carly, that's not possible.
- It's true.

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:03.406
It... The computer.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:05.775
The other night, he was
typing on the computer.

01:19:05.809 --> 01:19:07.977
Come on, Dad.
Type Mom a message.

01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:09.212
Come on.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.147
- [growling]
- Come on.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.282
Come on, Dad.
Do it like you did
the other night.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:14.918
Come on.
You know, like this.

01:19:16.019 --> 01:19:19.288
Just one sentence.
"I am Dad."

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:22.258
- How 'bout just "Dad"?
- [Rebecca sighs]

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:25.228
Kids...

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.063
...I know that these
last couple days

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.432
- have been difficult, but...
- [phone rings]

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.970
[phone ringing]

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.906
- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's me.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.274
It's your father.

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:39.943
[Rebecca] Wow.

01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:42.478
Uh, so many questions.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.414
Do you know why the kids
are at my office with Shaggy?

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:49.452
He's not Shaggy.
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:51.454
- Khyi Yag who?
- [barks]

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.089
[Dave] Po,
that's his real name.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.992
You know, how did the kids
find him? That's weird.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:57.961
That is not the only thing
that's weird.

01:19:57.994 --> 01:20:00.496
No, not that. You oughta
see what I'm lookin' at.

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:03.266
They're trying to tell me
that he is you.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.034
[Dave] Stop that!
What are you doing?

01:20:05.068 --> 01:20:07.303
- What?
- Stop doing that, all right?
You, quiet down.

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:11.007
He's not... Guys, guys,
guys, guys! He's not me.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.976
Well, yes, I gathered that.

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:16.145
But they're half right.
Look, um, I'll meet you
at the courthouse,

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:17.780
and I'll explain
everything to ya.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.217
- [Rebecca] I think you
better explain it now.
- Well, I can't explain...

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:25.154
Hold on a sec. I can't.
The chimp. What?
Excuse me. The monkey...

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:26.489
- [Rebecca] Hello?
- What is it?

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:28.357
[squealing]

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:31.895
The chimp... The chimp?
The chimp has got sunglasses on.

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.897
He's supposed to be
giving me directions.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.568
- [snarls]
- Honey, you gotta believe me.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:42.271
- [barking]
- [panting]

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.844
[barking]

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:54.217
- I'll meet you
at the courthouse.
- What?

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.486
Just meet me at
the courthouse and bring me
some clothes, OK?

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.155
- Dave!
- Watch the rat!

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:02.558
I love you!
Everybody, calm down!

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.060
Dave!

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:06.662
What's the matter
with you guys?

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.898
How come you can't act
like the snake here, right?

01:21:08.932 --> 01:21:11.034
- [barks]
- Eh.

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:14.037
He wants us to meet him
at the courthouse with
a change of clothes.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:18.041
- I don't get it.
- It doesn't make any sense.

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:19.575
Two days ago,

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:23.046
when your father came home
in the middle of the night,

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:25.581
he tried
to convince me that...

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.951
...he'd turned into a dog.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:36.192
- [in unison] Let's go
to the courthouse.
- Come on, come on.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.526
That's my Norah Jones CD.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.596
[Dave] You can play it
if you want. Play it.

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:43.066
- [horn honking]
- Or you could throw it
out of the car.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:48.071
Why'd you do that?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:49.973
Everybody watch out,
watch out!

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:53.209
[tires squealing]

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:56.079
- [Dave] Ahh!
- [snarls]

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.915
Phew. We're all done?

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:02.118
It's OK.
Yeah, it's all right.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.453
I know, I saw it coming.
[sighs]

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:07.290
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Whitaker.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.594
[bangs gavel]

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:13.929
[bailiff] Be seated
and come to order.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.240
All right.
[pants] I gotta go, guys.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.609
All right, you guys stay here.
All of you stay here.

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:29.979
Look, look.
I'll be right back.
Don't talk to anybody.

01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:32.248
Don't play the music,
and, uh...

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:34.450
You're in charge.

01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:48.497
[heartbeat accelerates]

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:25.234
To infinity and beyond!

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:42.651
Do you guys think
he's really coming?

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.387
I don't know, kids.

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:51.360
Wait, look!

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:03.372
[barking]

01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.509
[Carly] Daddy?
Is that you?

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:07.743
It's me, kiddo.

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:10.446
But it can't be.

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:12.515
He's a dog.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.750
[Dave]
Would a dog say this:

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:18.621
[barking] I love you.

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.623
What did you say?

01:24:20.656 --> 01:24:22.558
[barking] I love you.

01:24:26.262 --> 01:24:28.531
- Oh, honey.
- You got it.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.566
I love you too.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:36.672
I love you.

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:46.515
It's weird for me too.
But it is me.

01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:49.718
That was cool.

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:52.655
And I'm real sorry
about everything.
I'm really sorry.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:54.323
And I'll make it up
to all of you.

01:24:54.357 --> 01:24:56.492
But right now, I've
got a trial to stop.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:58.761
[Trey] Uh, Mr. Douglas?

01:24:58.794 --> 01:25:01.164
Yeah.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:05.301
- Ooh.
- No, I can't go.

01:25:06.369 --> 01:25:07.636
[chuckles]

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.739
- Everyone's gonna need
therapy after this.
- Good luck, honey.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:12.475
Counselors,
you may proceed.

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:13.909
Your Honor, at this time,

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.512
my client would like
to change his plea.

01:25:16.545 --> 01:25:18.447
Hold everything, please.
Hold everything.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:20.483
[crowd murmuring]

01:25:20.516 --> 01:25:22.251
Kozak, sit.

01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:24.620
[Judge Whitaker] Mr. Douglas,
it is my understanding

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:26.489
that you are
no longer on this case.

01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:27.923
That is exactly right,
Your Honor.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.592
I understand that,
Your Honor.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:33.162
If I could just have a few
moments with my associate.

01:25:33.196 --> 01:25:34.630
It's very important.

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:40.203
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:43.272
Give me a chance.
Give me one more chance.
I will not disappoint you.

01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:45.641
Stay, Kozak!

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:46.875
You gotta trust me.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:49.878
If you ever trusted me,
you gotta trust me
right this minute.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.785
- He's back on, Your Honor.
- [sighs]

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:58.687
We...

01:25:58.721 --> 01:26:01.857
Let's get Kozak back
on the stand one more time.
Let me handle it.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.292
[clears throat]

01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:06.562
We'd like to recall
Dr. Kozak to the stand.

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:10.499
[Judge Whitaker]
Dr. Kozak, would you please
return to the stand.

01:26:10.533 --> 01:26:14.169
Uh, I'd be, uh, delighted.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.643
Counselor, you are
on a very short leash.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:24.413
This court has lost
all patience with
ridiculous behavior.

01:26:24.447 --> 01:26:28.317
Your Honor, just because
something looks ridiculous
doesn't mean it's not true.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:31.520
Just takes more courage
to believe in it.

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:35.558
Just don't let your courage
get itself kicked out
of my courtroom.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.727
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:41.864
Dr. Kozak, may I remind you
you are still under oath.

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:43.699
Yes, you may.

01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:46.902
Dr. Kozak, is it true
your company is workin'
on a drug

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:49.438
that will extend human life
like a hundred years?

01:26:49.472 --> 01:26:51.840
I am not at liberty
to discuss that matter.

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:54.843
Of course you're not.
But if that were true,

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.346
that would be
a pretty big deal, right?

01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.915
Ah, "were true,"
which it is not, probably.

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:03.386
And whoever was in charge of
developing such a thing... Whoo!

01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.254
Not only would they
be insanely wealthy,

01:27:05.288 --> 01:27:07.856
they would be immortalized
in history, right?

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:10.559
[chuckles] Yes,
I suppose they would.

01:27:10.593 --> 01:27:13.929
Wow. Wow. What a thrill
it must be

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:16.432
to work under
Dr. Strictland.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.233
[sniffs]

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.102
'Scuse me.

01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:23.572
Dr. Strictland, the creative
force at your company, right?

01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:27.910
Well, it takes many different
people to contribute
to the higher... [babbles]

01:27:27.943 --> 01:27:30.579
[Dave] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
But what an honor it must be

01:27:30.613 --> 01:27:32.715
to work in
Dr. Strictland's shadow.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.617
No, no, no. I don't work
in anyone's shadow.

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:36.552
I wouldn't. I couldn't
live with myself.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:38.721
There's nothing wrong
with being in second place.

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:41.390
Second fiddle,
second banana, second up.

01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:43.926
I am the chief scientist.

01:27:43.959 --> 01:27:47.296
I, me, mine!
[growls]

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:48.897
[Dave] Ho! Come on.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.999
Gettin' kinda agitated.
What's up, dog?

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:53.502
Pick up a little virus
down there in the lab, did ya?

01:27:53.536 --> 01:27:55.804
Must be something
going around. [growling]

01:27:55.838 --> 01:27:58.707
[both growling, snarling]

01:28:03.312 --> 01:28:05.414
[Judge Whitaker]
No more growling.

01:28:05.448 --> 01:28:07.616
Mr. Douglas,
I have had enough.

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.085
He stole a sacred dog from China
and stuck needles in it

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.088
- and almost killed this thing
for his little experiments.
- Did not!

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.090
- The witness is not on trial.
- Thank you.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.825
You put your boss
in a coma, didn't you?

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:19.094
Bailiff, escort Mr. Douglas
out of the courtroom.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.929
You set that fire
to cover up your crime!

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:22.831
He set that fire,
and you're trying to...

01:28:22.865 --> 01:28:25.033
You're trying to
frame Forrester for it!

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:27.370
I've seen that monkey
that barks! It's real!

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:30.373
- Enough!
- They've also got this rabbit
they taught how to fetch!

01:28:30.406 --> 01:28:32.641
- He does!
- Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:28:32.675 --> 01:28:35.611
please disregard everything
Mr. Douglas has said.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.613
- [sighs]
- Hey!

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:40.349
Kozak! Kozak!
Kozak! Go fetch!

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:42.050
Mmm! [pants]

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:04.840
Sorry, uh, things are
a little stressy at work,

01:29:04.873 --> 01:29:06.642
long hours and the like.
What?

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.377
What?

01:29:08.411 --> 01:29:10.012
- [crowd gasping]
- What?

01:29:14.417 --> 01:29:17.720
- Oh!
- [crowd gasping]

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:20.523
[Kozak grunts] Whoo!

01:29:23.892 --> 01:29:26.662
[Dave] If that isn't evidence
of genetic mutation,

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:28.063
I don't know what is!

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.533
On second thought, bailiff,
take him into custody.

01:29:30.566 --> 01:29:32.535
For what?

01:29:32.568 --> 01:29:34.537
Shufflin' around
a little DNA? Huh?

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.872
Don't you morons realize
I can make us all immortal?

01:29:36.905 --> 01:29:39.742
Animals don't care. They don't
even understand what's goin' on!

01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:41.577
Don't tell me
they don't understand.

01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:44.580
Animals understand.
I know different.

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.951
Yeah, you know.
[chuckles]

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:50.853
This isn't over.
We got so much in common.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.121
Let's stay in touch, huh?
[growls]

01:29:53.155 --> 01:29:55.458
Ooh!
Are we goin' outside?

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:00.796
[chuckles]

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:04.867
I owe you an apology.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.769
You got this one right,
after all.

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.571
Thank you, Ken.

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:12.441

how that car got here.

01:30:15.611 --> 01:30:17.980
- Would...?
- [Dave] All right, boss,

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:20.816
I want you to set up
a trust fund to help
my animal friends there.

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:24.419
- Keep 'em off the highway.
- [Ken] Absolutely.

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:29.458
After today, ace, you're
a shoo-in to get elected DA.

01:30:29.492 --> 01:30:31.727
- [chuckles]
- Take your kudos.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.996
I have some more
important people to talk to.

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:36.565
- I'll see ya, guys.
- Dave, congratulations
on the case.

01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:38.734
Thank you all very much.
No, thank... You know what?

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:42.104
I will have a prepared
statement from my office.

You made a great dog, Dad.

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.146
But you're gonna make
an even better DA.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:55.150
Carly, it means the world
to me to hear you say that.

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.752
It really does.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:03.158
[sighs] It took the eyes
of a dog for me to see

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:05.761
that I made it hard
for you to tell the truth.

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.931
The truth is, son,
whatever you love

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.999
I'm gonna love
and support too.

01:31:11.033 --> 01:31:12.801

I love you too.
