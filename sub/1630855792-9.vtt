08:10.407 --> 08:13.158
- Oh, absolutely.
- Uh-huh, yep, she is.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.703
- Hold on.
My torch is low.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.121
- You must be devastated

08:18.165 --> 08:19.873
That there's nothing
to burn down here.

08:19.917 --> 08:20.916
I can see.
Follow me.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.584
- Okay, but--

08:22.628 --> 08:23.835
[whimpering]

08:23.921 --> 08:24.836
- Are you crying?

08:24.922 --> 08:25.962
- No.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.672
I hear the same sound.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.924
I think it's a freak draft

08:28.967 --> 08:30.675
Or a sad stalagmite.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.177
- You're afraid of the dark.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.387
- In science
we call that a theory.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.640
Good luck proving it.
[sniffling]

08:36.725 --> 08:37.766
What's with the worm?

08:37.809 --> 08:39.059
- It's part
of the natural world,

08:39.144 --> 08:40.519
Emits light
without you chopping it down.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.312
But you don't need it,
so I'll just--

08:42.356 --> 08:44.272
- Keep the worm on!
Keep the worm on!

08:44.316 --> 08:46.816
- What does science call that?
- Bullying.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.860
[shouting and jeering]

08:48.946 --> 08:50.529
- Stop! Break it up!

08:50.572 --> 08:51.530
Now what?

08:51.823 --> 08:53.532
- Pants guy tried
to get back into the bar!

08:53.617 --> 08:54.824
- Because I like drinking!

08:54.952 --> 08:56.618
And I wear pants!

08:56.703 --> 08:57.911
- Okay, first of all,

08:57.996 --> 09:00.205
This city's angry mob
threshold is too low.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.122
[mob yelling]

09:01.166 --> 09:03.166
Sounds like you know I'm right!

09:03.252 --> 09:04.751
Dad?
[boos and jeers]

09:04.795 --> 09:06.878
- Now you're protecting
pants guy?

09:06.964 --> 09:08.880
- Pants guy has a name.
- And I don't?

09:08.924 --> 09:10.632
- I'll learn yours
when you learn his.

09:10.676 --> 09:11.758
- What's his?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.593
- [spluttering]
it doesn't matter.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.719
Just get back to your lives.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.720
- Whatever, man!
[mob grumbling]

09:15.764 --> 09:17.222
- Yeah, grumble, grumble,

09:17.307 --> 09:19.048
Worst king ever--
like I'm the problem.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.308
Thanks for a tough lesson,
by the way.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.186
I'd rather be fighting
a monstadon.

09:24.648 --> 09:25.647
- This is the same cavern.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.856
- No, it's not.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.608
- Daphne, I'm not just
being a dick.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.068
I marked this rock, see?

09:30.153 --> 09:31.861
- [sighs]
I'm getting weak.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.071
- We're pretty far
from the trees.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.739
That's where you get
your power, right?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.741
- What? You're not
supposed to know that.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.451
- I research.
I learn.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.704
Nobody's supposed
to know anything.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.122
I'm not supposed to walk.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.207
The weak aren't supposed
to be strong.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.751
I'm supposed to be
sucking algae off a rock in--

09:46.837 --> 09:48.086
- In the darkness.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.005
- Nature's order isn't fair.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.089
I could make you equipment

09:51.133 --> 09:52.716
That would let you leave
the forest.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.301
- The forest is leaving me.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.971
Your city eats trees
and craps...Crap.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.723
And you never researched
the monstadon,

09:59.808 --> 10:01.850
Or you'd know you can
keep it away from your city

10:01.893 --> 10:04.060
With giant scorpion urine.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.772
- Giant scorpion urine,
of course!

10:07.858 --> 10:10.025
I don't suppose
nature makes explosions?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.110
I could fracture this rock
at the base.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.278
- Have you tried
these mushrooms?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.447
- No, thanks.
I take a lot of stuff

10:15.532 --> 10:18.199
Just to stay focused,
and I probably shouldn't mix.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.535
- No, we light them,
and they explode.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.787
We give them to human children
and say they're candy.

10:22.831 --> 10:23.788
It's hilarious.

10:23.874 --> 10:24.998
- Killing kids...
[chuckles]

10:25.042 --> 10:26.916
Yeah, I can see
how that's funny.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.460
Okay, my arrows are made
of flint.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.920
- We'll need a lot of these
and some kind of, um,

10:31.006 --> 10:32.589
Sticky substance.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.882
- That I've got covered,

10:33.925 --> 10:36.009
Or I'm covered in
very naturally.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.844
- Holding your hand
was disgusting.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.596
- That's just
my reproductive jelly.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.431
You'll get used to it, mom.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.974
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm kidding.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.602
It's mostly mucus.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.229
[creatures screeching]

10:49.483 --> 10:50.273
- Harpies!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.358
- Again?

10:51.485 --> 10:53.360
We don't go into their nest
and kill them.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.613
Oh, no, wait.
We actually did do that before.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.947
My bad.
[harpies shrieking]

10:58.033 --> 10:59.908
All: Huzzah!
- So great!

10:59.951 --> 11:03.995
I can't wait to tell my human
parents about this adventure!

11:04.039 --> 11:05.330
Does everyone here share

11:05.415 --> 11:07.916
Their accomplishments
with your families,

11:08.001 --> 11:11.878
Or are--are you kind of
selfish and isolated?

11:11.963 --> 11:14.255
[quietly] what?
- You call this supporting me?

11:14.299 --> 11:16.257
- I'm putting up
with a lot here, girl.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.635
Do you know how much
I'm pretending my feet hurt?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.928
- Oh, no!

11:20.013 --> 11:22.055
Another harpy!

11:22.140 --> 11:23.682
- Wait, what?
- We're coming!

11:23.767 --> 11:26.601
- They're all attacking susan!

11:26.645 --> 11:29.270
- You wouldn't.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.023
You would.
You'd murder susan,

11:32.109 --> 11:34.442
Because you can't share
a sliver of attention.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.612
- Or susan's just fine,
because you can't.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.781
- Almost there!
Hold on!

11:39.825 --> 11:40.907
- It's too late.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.492
She's gone.

11:43.745 --> 11:48.206
- [flatly] help!

11:49.042 --> 11:51.251
Both: No!
- Susan, no!

11:51.294 --> 11:54.713
I really, really, really,
really liked her!

11:54.798 --> 11:56.172
- Yeah, she knew the risks.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.508
- We'll give her
a hero's funeral.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.010
- Susan hated funerals.
She said when she died,

12:01.096 --> 12:03.555
She wanted everyone
to forget she ever lived

12:03.640 --> 12:04.973
And go back to questing.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.683
- I was considering
asking her out.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.144
- I can see that.
She was plainer than the type

12:09.229 --> 12:12.272
You tend to pursue, but you've
always been self-destructive.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.232
- Well, you know, my mom was
such a big personality.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.151
- Yep, and then we look
for our moms

12:16.236 --> 12:18.027
Because we want to revisit
and fix things.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.821
- And then we treat women
like garbage

12:19.865 --> 12:21.281
Because we're babies.

12:21.366 --> 12:25.118
- A real man, a confident,
mature man ends up with a susan

12:25.203 --> 12:26.745
And straight up worships her.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.204
- We'll do that tonight,

12:28.290 --> 12:31.291
An altar and a prayer
to our goddess, susan!

12:31.334 --> 12:32.625
Both: Susan!

12:32.711 --> 12:34.169
- [groans]

12:34.254 --> 12:35.378
- There you are.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.631
Wow, those idiots out there
really want you

12:38.717 --> 12:39.758
To take off your pants.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.717
- What about you?

12:40.761 --> 12:41.885
- I can't stress enough

12:41.970 --> 12:43.595
How little I care, buddy.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.888
Let me tell you a secret.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.556
I didn't start a city
because I respect people.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.309
If there were a better,
safer job that I could pull off

12:49.352 --> 12:51.352
More convincingly by talking
to less of them,

12:51.396 --> 12:52.187
I'd be out of here.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.938
The idea that someone's pants

12:54.024 --> 12:55.356
Could end up
costing me everything--

12:55.400 --> 12:58.818
I mean, not just me,
the whole city, people's lives.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.570
I mean, it's ridiculous!

13:00.655 --> 13:01.654
It's pointless!

13:01.782 --> 13:02.781
You agree with that, right?

13:02.866 --> 13:04.282
It's--it's point--

13:05.911 --> 13:06.910
- Where's pants guy?

13:06.995 --> 13:07.911
- He was here, but--

13:07.996 --> 13:09.621
- Did you say something to him?

13:09.664 --> 13:10.747
- I mean, nothing new.

13:10.791 --> 13:11.748
You know my position.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.874
- I know you don't have one.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.000
- Which is the one to have.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.084
- I don't disagree.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.504
- I've always liked that
about you.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.509
Okay, we better find him
before he gets killed.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.010
Pants guy!

13:24.054 --> 13:25.970
- We are gathered
to honor susan,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.555
Which was not my idea.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.849
She was more powerful
than people know,

13:29.976 --> 13:31.851
Did not like letting go
of that power.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.062
In fact, she was
such a control freak,

13:34.147 --> 13:35.980
I'm pretty shocked
she can handle laying here

13:36.066 --> 13:37.148
Without interrupting.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.900
- Oof.
- Shouldn't gallows humor

13:38.985 --> 13:40.610
Have more humor?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.904
- Yeah, the goal
isn't typically

13:42.948 --> 13:44.405
To take the deceased
down a peg.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.573
- Well, guess what?

13:45.659 --> 13:47.283
I knew the real susan,
and you guys didn't.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.869
So you can let me get
some stuff off my chest,

13:49.955 --> 13:51.246
Or you can be the next funeral.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.747
- And that's fine too.
- Fair enough.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.915
- Yes, yes.
Okay. All right.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.291
- Are you sure
this is gonna work?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.585
- That's definitely one
of two possibilities.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.753
- The other?
- Mm.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.213
We die buried
under a mountain of rubble.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.258
- Well, at least I'd get
to die with a friend.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.217
- The worm?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.803
That thing doesn't
even have a face!

14:06.888 --> 14:08.638
Oh, you meant me.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.557
That's...Nice.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.851
- For the record,
I'd rather us both survive.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.936
- Obviously,
that's my preference too.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.230
Okay, here we go.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.153
[panting]

14:24.197 --> 14:26.447
- We did it!
- There's so much light!

14:26.533 --> 14:28.324
I love nature!

14:28.410 --> 14:29.033
- I love science!

14:29.119 --> 14:30.660
- Nature!
- Science!

14:30.704 --> 14:31.828
- Nature!
- Science!

14:31.913 --> 14:33.872
[monstadon growling]
both: Monstadon!

14:33.957 --> 14:35.373
[monstadon snarls
and screeches]

14:36.251 --> 14:37.333
- There he is.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.752
- I guess he'd rather
be somewhere free.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.297
- I think the lesson here is
that if you give things

14:42.340 --> 14:44.841
Enough time, most issues
work themselves out.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.593
- [screaming]

14:46.678 --> 14:48.595
[monstadon roars]

14:50.432 --> 14:52.849
- And then there was this time
she left me on a raft--

14:52.934 --> 14:54.934
And by raft,
I mean a scrap of wood--

14:55.020 --> 14:57.478
So she could go
to an underwater orgy

14:57.564 --> 14:58.855
At poseidon's palace.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.898
- Are you having fun?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.482
[all exclaim]
- susan's alive!

15:01.526 --> 15:03.568
- Susan, I love you!

15:03.653 --> 15:04.861
But why don't you bleed?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.321
- For the same reason
you don't have a shot,

15:06.406 --> 15:07.280
You gangly dork.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.949
I'm an olympian goddess.
[all gasp]

15:09.993 --> 15:12.785
I'm also this ungrateful
meatball's mother,

15:12.829 --> 15:14.746
Which is apparently
the worst thing

15:14.789 --> 15:16.539
That has ever happened to her!

15:16.625 --> 15:17.665
- Uh, yeah.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.000
- And will you ever let

15:19.085 --> 15:21.044
The poseidon thing go?

15:21.129 --> 15:24.756
What was I supposed to do,
bring a child to an orgy?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.591
It was underwater!

15:26.676 --> 15:27.759
- I warned you.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.844
I am never speaking
to you again.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.429
Now go away!

15:31.514 --> 15:33.598
- Wait, hold on.
We have a goddess

15:33.642 --> 15:34.724
In our adventuring party?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.059
- She's not in our party.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.728
- Unless that's something
you think you'd want.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.104
- What?
- But my daughter can't

15:40.190 --> 15:42.899
Be around me,
so I guess you have to choose.

15:42.943 --> 15:43.900
- What?
- Uh, you.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.568
- We choose you!
- I love you!

15:45.695 --> 15:46.903
- You're the worst!

15:46.988 --> 15:48.738
- You made that clear.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.406
And contrary to your eulogy,

15:50.492 --> 15:51.741
I do have feelings.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.076
So mean!

15:53.119 --> 15:54.202
- I'm on your mom's side.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.871
You're a bad daughter.
- Yes, but you don't

15:56.915 --> 15:58.498
Get to say that.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.046
- That was so easy.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.547
I can't believe
your daughter was actually

16:06.591 --> 16:08.049
Choosing to do things
the hard way.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.551
- Setting herself up to fail.
- Well, it's annoying.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.720
We could have been questing
the deliria way all along.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.807
- Yes, the good news is,
everything comes easier to me.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.017
The bad news is,
that includes getting bored.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.102
Let's finish this up.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.020
- Hmm.
You and fantabulous

16:21.064 --> 16:22.981
Are very similar
in that regard.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.817
- Can you magically zap out
that helmet for us?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.276
- Ugh.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.319
Zap.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.907
We did it. Hooray.
Quest over.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.534
Let's go home
and never do this again.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.119
- Nay, the quest continues!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.997
There may be
more adventure ahead.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.790
Jeez, first time questing much?

16:40.875 --> 16:43.501
[laughter]

16:43.545 --> 16:44.877
Told you, adventure.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.295
You coming?
- I only did this

16:46.423 --> 16:49.716
So I could spend some time
with my stupid idiot daughter.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.175
And now I'm stuck with you,

16:51.219 --> 16:54.053
Her even bigger
stupid idiot "friends"

16:54.139 --> 16:55.972
Who literally abandoned her
at the drop of a--

16:56.057 --> 16:58.224
[foundation rumbling,
all yelling]

17:01.354 --> 17:03.688
- [roars]

17:03.773 --> 17:04.731
[groans]

17:04.774 --> 17:06.065
Hey, deliria!

17:06.067 --> 17:08.276
Remember when you
and your olympic butt-buddies

17:08.403 --> 17:10.728
Imprisoned me
thousands of years ago?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.779
- Iapetus?

17:11.823 --> 17:12.989
Why is a titan here?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.907
Is this a normal part
of your whole thing?

17:14.951 --> 17:16.868
- No!
I don't know what this is!

17:16.911 --> 17:19.203
[screaming]

17:19.289 --> 17:20.204
- Good god!

17:20.331 --> 17:21.914
Is that what's
inside all mortals?

17:22.000 --> 17:22.990
[both yelling]

17:23.001 --> 17:24.876
- Yeah, same basic setup.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.419
- And now to deal with you.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.381
That has never happened
to me before, I swear.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.842
- You and the rest
of those bastard olympians

17:32.969 --> 17:35.011
Buried me in a pit
for all eternity!

17:35.055 --> 17:36.262
And it wasn't even a nice pit!

17:36.347 --> 17:38.222
- No, that was
all the other olympians!

17:38.266 --> 17:41.017
I tried to stop them.
I was like, guys, no.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.019
Not cool.
Iapetus is the best.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.854
- Liar!
- Well, yes, obviously.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.981
Like you'd be super honest
in my situation.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.983
- [growling]
- [yelps]

17:49.027 --> 17:50.610
I've always thought
you were handsome,

17:50.653 --> 17:51.861
Not in the traditional sense.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.863
But as horrific titans go,
you're a 10!

17:53.865 --> 17:56.532
- [growling]
- [yells]

17:56.618 --> 17:59.285
- You came back to save me!

17:59.329 --> 18:02.121
- That's what epic heroes
of legend do.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.456
- Oh, and all
your friends are dead.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.666
You're actually standing
in some of them right now.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.709
- Ugh.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.088
- [roaring]

18:11.382 --> 18:12.507
- [grunts]

18:14.761 --> 18:16.260
Okay, now I'm out of ideas.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.970
- We need to get him back
in his hole

18:18.056 --> 18:19.430
And put some of that
magic dirt on top.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.141
It's enchanted to weigh
as much as the entire world.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.018
That's the only way
to trap a titan.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.020
That's right, magic dirt.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.022
- I'm gonna need something
sturdier than this.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.482
- I suppose I could
conjure you up--

18:29.609 --> 18:30.983
Ooh!

18:31.027 --> 18:31.984
- [yelling]
- [shrieking]

18:32.028 --> 18:33.486
- [grunting]
- aah!

18:33.571 --> 18:35.321
- Oof!

18:35.365 --> 18:38.324
- [grunting]

18:39.619 --> 18:41.077
- [groaning]

18:41.162 --> 18:43.621
- And that's
how you take out a titan.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.789
- We did it!

18:44.907 --> 18:46.124
Well, mostly you.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.250
- Let's go home.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.960
- This is probably
the concussion talking,

18:49.045 --> 18:50.670
But I am very proud of you.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.921
We make a pretty good team.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.214
- We're never doing this again.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.007
- No, not in a million years.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.138
- Oh, hey, scorpion urine!

19:00.181 --> 19:02.390
And I didn't nail it to a tree.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.599
- That's nice.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.143
This still doesn't
end well though.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.854
The forest has to kill the city
or die trying.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.647
- I respect that!

19:09.691 --> 19:11.232
- I respect you.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.692
Goodbye.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.193
- Bye.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.363
[crowd murmuring]

19:17.490 --> 19:18.614
[all gasping]

19:18.658 --> 19:19.699
- My word!

19:19.742 --> 19:22.451
[murmuring continues]

19:24.038 --> 19:26.914
- Starting today,
I'll be wearing pants.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.666
I'll also be declaring
new laws,

19:28.751 --> 19:30.001
Laws you won't like

19:30.086 --> 19:32.003
Because they will be laws
that guarantee freedom,

19:32.046 --> 19:35.131
And they can only do that
by taking freedom away.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.299
That's what happens
when spoiled children

19:36.342 --> 19:38.885
Abuse their toys--
they get confiscated.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.011
We drove a man into danger

19:40.096 --> 19:41.888
Because we wanted
to feel comfort.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.766
We found a person inconvenient,
so we killed him, together,

19:45.852 --> 19:47.059
Without lifting a finger.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.645
<i> That's the power of freedom,</i>

19:49.731 --> 19:53.858
<i> Power we are not allowed</i>
<i> to play with until we grow up.</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:56.027
<i> And we are going to grow up.</i>

19:56.112 --> 19:57.987
<i> We are going</i>
<i> to get our crap together.</i>

19:58.031 --> 19:59.989
<i> We are going</i>
<i> to get big and strong.</i>

20:00.074 --> 20:02.074
<i> We're going to change</i>
<i> how we treat each other,</i>

20:02.202 --> 20:05.494
<i> And that's how we're going</i>
<i> to change the entire world.</i>

20:05.538 --> 20:08.289
And that's why
I'm gonna be famous.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.950
W-we--we don't have
to make that the priority.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.126
I'm just predicting that
as a result.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.170
I'd like a moment of silence

20:14.255 --> 20:16.589
For whatever
pants guy's name was.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.925
Did anyone get his name?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.927
Is that a no, or is this
the moment of silence?

20:21.012 --> 20:22.553
[crowd murmuring]
- I didn't hear his name.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.055
- Sorry.
- Shameful.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.475
A moment of shameful silence
for pants guy.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.978
I know I said I was going
to wear these forever,

20:31.064 --> 20:32.313
But I think I've made my point,

20:32.440 --> 20:34.106
And they're really pinching
my crack.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.983
Is it okay
if I stop wearing these?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.068
[crowd chattering]
- please.

20:37.111 --> 20:37.944
- Yeah, sure.
- Sure, that's fine.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.612
- We don't mind.
- Thank you.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.198
Shame on us, and thank you.

20:44.619 --> 20:44.951
- And what's up with how
when something pierces

20:46.871 --> 20:49.580
Our mortal skin,
red stuff comes out?

20:49.624 --> 20:51.791
I mean, red stuff much?

20:51.876 --> 20:55.127
[laughter]

20:55.171 --> 20:58.130
And what is up with tongues?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.841
We have to use
our own mouth meat

21:00.927 --> 21:03.052
Just to taste other meat?

21:03.096 --> 21:05.596
[laughs]
who came up with that?

21:05.682 --> 21:09.141
[laughter]

21:09.227 --> 21:11.102
- You told them it's her,
didn't you?

21:11.145 --> 21:12.812
- Seemed like
the right thing to do.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.314
- And our hair
just keeps growing

21:15.358 --> 21:18.484
Unless we cut it off,
am I right?

21:18.528 --> 21:21.070
[laughter]

21:21.197 --> 21:22.989
- That's good!
- Thank you!

21:23.116 --> 21:26.367
I'm susan, the funny one!

21:26.411 --> 21:29.287
[laughter]

21:29.664 --> 21:31.289
<i> - Did you get any of that?</i>

21:33.543 --> 21:34.500
<i> - Bento.</i>
