WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:05.104
So, you guys have a big
anniversary coming up, huh?

00:05.106 --> 00:07.373
Yup. 20 years.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.074
20 years with Don.
Yeah.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.377
That is hard time.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.511
ANDI:
You know, you might want

00:12.512 --> 00:13.644
to get her something
more romantic

00:13.647 --> 00:16.648
than last year's
Chipotle gift card.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.218
It was $19--
a dollar a year.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.354
It's not about
how much he spends on me.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.689
That's my girl.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.157
It's about finding a gift
that's thoughtful,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.792
meaningful, that shows
how well he knows me.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.029
Oh, so you want disappointment
for your anniversary.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.730
KATE:
Hey.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.665
Mom, can we go
to the mall tomorrow?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.701
I found the perfect outfit
for Saturday night.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.336
Oh, what's, uh...
what's Saturday night?

00:37.338 --> 00:38.103
My first date.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.606
What?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.441
Um, actually, honey,

00:42.443 --> 00:45.277
I-I haven't really discussed
that with your dad, yet.

00:45.279 --> 00:48.247
Oh. (laughs)

00:48.249 --> 00:50.416
Just remember, Daddy,
you're my hero.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.384
(chuckles)

00:52.386 --> 00:54.119
Buckle up, baby.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.755
Katie has a date Saturday night?

00:56.757 --> 00:59.191
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.593
Sunday morning.

01:01.595 --> 01:05.531
We agreed she was not gonna date
until she's 35.

01:05.533 --> 01:09.802
No, you just said that one day
after we watched<i> Teen Mom.</i>

01:09.804 --> 01:11.837
She's almost 14.
Most of her friends

01:11.839 --> 01:13.472
have been dating for months.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.840
MARCY:
This is when it starts.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.775
I was 13
when I first went out with Don.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.110
Mm-hmm.
You hear that?

01:18.112 --> 01:20.779
Marcy could have been somebody.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.183
Come on, it's not like I'm
making her a child bride.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.353
She's just going out with that
nice boy from her class-- Royce.

01:28.355 --> 01:33.092
Royce? Royce-- with all the hair
and the wallet on a chain?

01:33.094 --> 01:36.662
What's a 13-year-old kid
need a wallet for anyway?

01:36.664 --> 01:37.463
Condoms.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.164
Don!

01:39.166 --> 01:40.732
No, he's right.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.134
You know, I've seen
that Royce kid around.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.669
He's a player.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.137
And you know this because?

01:45.139 --> 01:47.539
Andi. Who are you talking to?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.841
Huh?

01:48.843 --> 01:50.776
I was 14 once.
I know the game.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.178
Right? You give the gals
a little bit of this,

01:53.180 --> 01:55.114
a little bit of that,

01:55.116 --> 01:56.815
and all the red lights
turn green!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.251
Oh, my God. (laughs)

01:59.253 --> 02:00.886
Trust me.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.322
I can spot my own kind.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.424
Yeah, we players know players.
Mm-hmm.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.893
Well, look, you're being
protective, all right?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.462
And-and I love that about you,
but we both know

02:10.464 --> 02:12.831
that you are not gonna like
anyone she dates.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.666
No. No, that's not it.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.569
My instincts are telling me
that this kid is no good.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.171
And I don't want Katie
dating him.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.806
Okay, well, I already
told her that she could.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.308
If it makes you feel
any better, I-I can...

02:23.310 --> 02:26.612
I can do a little of this. Huh?

02:26.614 --> 02:28.881
And a little bit of that.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.259
That's not how you do it.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.896
Okay, and you can't just
make a unilateral decision.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.498
We discuss things
in this family.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.269
Well, yes, usually, but, you
know, I knew you'd say no,

02:50.271 --> 02:52.371
and then, I'd veto your no,
so then I just thought, hey,

02:52.373 --> 02:55.841
(blows raspberry) why not
just cut out the middle man?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.277
Okay, well, first of all
(blows raspberry)

02:58.279 --> 02:59.678
I'm not the middle man.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.413
Okay?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.182
I am<i> the</i> man.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.918
And second of all,
if you're going to unilaterally

03:05.920 --> 03:08.754
decide she can go, then
I'm going to unilaterally

03:08.756 --> 03:09.888
decide that your decision

03:09.890 --> 03:12.791
is caca.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.526
Oh, don't you remember
<i> Romeo and Juliet?</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:16.895
If you don't give your daughter
the freedom to date

03:16.897 --> 03:18.931
who she wants,
it does not end well.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.533
Oh. Well, don't you remember
those<i> Taken</i> movies?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.702
That's what happens when
you give your daughter freedom.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.272
Taken, Andi. One, two,
three times they get taken.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.947
¶ ¶

03:44.425 --> 03:45.757
Mwah. Okay, bye, guys.
In you go.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.659
Bye, Daddy.
Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.428
Hey, Royce.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.729
What's up, girl?
(laughs)

03:52.900 --> 03:54.833
You see that?
He called her "girl."

03:54.835 --> 03:56.668
She has a name, Royce!

03:56.670 --> 03:59.504
Yeah, it's Kate.
Sometimes Katie.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.307
Ah, guys like that
never listen to me.
Yeah.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.676
Hey, uh, Mrs. Rodriguez?
Mm?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.011
Um, what do you know
about that kid Royce

04:06.013 --> 04:07.813
that's always hanging around
Katie?

04:07.815 --> 04:08.880
Oh, he's one of my favorites.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.232
He's an honor roll student,

04:10.233 --> 04:11.583
started his own
dog-walking company,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.518
even works weekends at the mall.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.721
Oh, I see, huh?
He charmed you, too, huh?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.990
What'd he do, give you
a little bit of this

04:17.992 --> 04:19.825
little bit of that?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.293
Stop that.
What is that?

04:21.295 --> 04:25.364
There's children here,
for God sakes.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.366
I'm telling you, I have got

04:27.368 --> 04:29.668
a gut feeling that this kid is
no good. I just need proof.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.987
So what's the plan, chief?

04:31.988 --> 04:34.305
Well, first, keep calling
me "chief." I like that.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.707
Ooh, okay.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.609
These kids put everything
they do on the Internet.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.045
Maybe we can find
something on him there.
Oh, I'm your man.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.614
If there is dirty laundry about
Royce online, I'll find it.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.451
I'm like Russia, but with
the easy grace of France.
Oh.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.854
Well, I'm like America,
so let's go get a burger

04:48.856 --> 04:52.557
and stick our noses
where they don't belong.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.459
LOWELL:
<i> Okay.</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:58.030
I managed to uncover
Royce's public Instagram page.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.766
Lowell, I could
have done that.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.635
But then we wouldn't be
on this buddy adventure.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.339
Oh, look at this.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.374
Every picture,
he's with a different girl.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.511
I knew Royce was a dog.
I got to show this to Andi.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.613
Oh, that's my comput...
Okay, it's fine!

05:23.824 --> 05:27.059
You know, I just realized
we've never been alone together.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.861
You're an odd bird, aren't you?

05:29.863 --> 05:33.031
I have feelings, if that's
what you're getting at.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.669
Great, because I have a question
for somebody who has feelings.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.605
My anniversary is coming up, and
I have a gift in mind for Marcy.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.840
Let me run it by you.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.575
Oh, I'm great at finding
the perfect gift.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.543
Hit me with it.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.511
A dirt bike.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.014
Why would you get Marcy
a dirt bike?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.451
Ah. Because secretly,
I want a dirt bike.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.353
Do you see where I'm going
with this?

05:54.355 --> 05:55.754
Uh-huh, uh huh.
Ah?

05:55.756 --> 05:59.758
Yeah, uh, may I suggest jewelry?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.426
I don't wear much jewelry.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.794
For Marcy!

06:02.796 --> 06:04.963
Oh.
Let-Let's think about her.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.665
What does Marcy mean to you?

06:06.667 --> 06:09.634
She's the mother of my son
and the love of my life.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.770
Good! And when you
think of her, you feel?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.572
Guilty.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.674
Something nice.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.376
Horny?

06:17.378 --> 06:18.643
Dear God.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.078
What other feelings are there?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.749
Nope. That's all of them.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.952
Whose computer is this?

06:26.954 --> 06:29.654
Will you pay attention?

06:29.656 --> 06:32.557
Okay, look at Royce's Instagram.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.793
Royce, girl.
Royce, two girls.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.996
Royce between two
half-naked girls.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.032
They're on a beach.
(scoffs)

06:41.034 --> 06:43.969
Read the hashtags.
#SavingaBeachedWhale.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.705
#SavingTheWorld.
#Peace.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.107
What a weirdo!

06:49.109 --> 06:50.709
Adam, you're grasping
at straws now.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.744
I'm telling you,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.147
I have looked in this kid's
eyes, and they are black,

06:55.149 --> 06:57.682
like a shark looking for dinner.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.752
And Katie's just
like some cute seal

07:00.754 --> 07:02.954
flopping around on the beach.
with her mom telling her,

07:02.956 --> 07:06.024
"Go out in the water.
Play, yeah."

07:06.026 --> 07:07.926
He is gonna break her heart,

07:07.928 --> 07:10.762
and I'm not gonna sit back
and watch it happen.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.130
Okay but you can't
just go out on your own

07:12.132 --> 07:14.466
and start cyber-stalking
a 13-year-old.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.501
Oh, really?

07:16.503 --> 07:19.104
It sounds to me like you wish
we had discussed it first.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.205
Yeah.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.506
Well, I knew you'd say no,

07:21.508 --> 07:23.442
and then I'd veto your no,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.510
so I thought, hey,
why not cut out the middle man?

07:25.512 --> 07:26.745
Yeah, it doesn't
feel good, does it?

07:26.747 --> 07:30.482
Okay, first of all,
I am not the middle man.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.850
I'm the wife.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.785
Which means I can stay mad

07:33.787 --> 07:35.520
a lot longer than you can.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.757
And I have made
the unilateral decision

07:38.759 --> 07:40.926
that, mm,
you need to stay out of this.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.661
Well, then, I just made
the unilateral decision

07:42.663 --> 07:44.796
that I'm not gonna do
what you say.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.731
Yes, you will.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.470
Whose computer is this?

07:51.472 --> 07:52.804
ADAM:
<i> Okay.</i>

07:52.806 --> 07:54.806
Royce should be here
any minute.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.675
Mrs. Rodriguez told me
he had a dog-walking company,

07:56.677 --> 07:59.244
so I booked an appointment
online to get him to come over.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.645
You know, scare him a little,

08:00.647 --> 08:02.814
show him the kind of dad
he'll be dealing with.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.683
Didn't Andi say
to stay out of it?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.218
Yeah, well, she's not in charge.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.053
And more importantly,
she's not here.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.789
All right,
what do you want me to do?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.257
Just back me up, all right?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.593
Oh, you want me
to be the goon, huh?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.195
Don't worry. I know what to do.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.764
I'm not even allowed
in Chuck E. Cheese anymore.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.602
Oh, here, here, here.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.604
Good morning,
Mr. Burns.
Royce.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.573
Thanks for calling me.
You won't be sorry.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.710
When you book me,
you'll be a 100% satisfied.

08:33.247 --> 08:37.015
"Make the right choice.
Call Royce."

08:37.017 --> 08:39.584
Is that what you tell
all the girls?

08:39.586 --> 08:40.785
What?

08:40.787 --> 08:41.853
Did he stutter?!

08:43.690 --> 08:46.758
Look, I actually
called you over here

08:46.760 --> 08:49.761
for a confidential
conversation, man-to-man.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.731
Nothing we talk about
can get back to Katie.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.267
All right? You know my wife,
you know my daughter.

08:55.269 --> 08:58.069
Now it's time for you
to get to know me.

08:58.071 --> 09:02.641
For instance, one of my hobbies
is I like to take walks

09:02.643 --> 09:05.010
in the woods and
bury things in holes.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.581
Sometimes I
take one thing,

09:09.583 --> 09:12.851
cut it up, and bury it
in different holes.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.787
Depends on my mood.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.056
He's moody!

09:22.696 --> 09:25.564
I guess what I really
wanted you to know is Katie

09:25.566 --> 09:30.201
is my little girl,
so you date Katie, you date me.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.706
You upset Katie,
you upset me.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.342
Okay? Now a lot of parents
these days are hands off,

09:37.344 --> 09:41.580
but me-- I'm more hands on.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.348
You see what I'm saying?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.083
He touches kids!

09:50.357 --> 09:52.757
I think that went pretty well
with Royce this morning.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.359
Yeah.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.896
There was a few hiccups
on your end, but...

09:57.898 --> 09:59.197
I think we guaranteed

09:59.199 --> 10:02.133
that Royce will be a perfect
gentleman on their date.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.739
What's wrong with her?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.007
Royce cancelled their date.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.342
What?

10:10.344 --> 10:13.178
Uh, did he happen
to mention why?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.213
No. No, he just,
he-he texted her

10:15.215 --> 10:17.248
and didn't explain anything.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.751
Oh, that's good.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.786
I mean, the why
isn't really important.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.922
What's important is that
we establish who's to blame,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.024
and that is Royce.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.959
Well, I am gonna call
Royce's mom,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.795
and we are gonna get
to the bottom of this.
What? No, no, no, no.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.365
You don't need to get
to the bottom of it.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.301
Let's stay at the top.
It's nice at the top, huh?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.938
The penthouse of life--
that's where we live.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.741
What?
Well, I'm just saying,
you're right.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.409
In fact, you're
always right.

10:44.411 --> 10:48.647
From now on, we should
do whatever you say.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.819
What did you do?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.322
Let me tell her, please.
Let me be the one to tell her.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.898
So you scared Royce
into cancelling their date?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.267
I scared Royce.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.835
And he cancelled their date.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.338
You can't prove the connection.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.739
Okay, well, good job, Adam,

11:14.741 --> 11:16.408
because your daughter
is heartbroken.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.711
You did the exact thing to her
that you said Royce would do.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.413
Yeah, but she thinks he did it.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.184
So I say now we do your thing
and just stay out of it.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.285
Okay?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.720
I mean, we don't want

11:28.722 --> 11:31.156
to<i> Romeo and Juliet</i> this sucker.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.824
No, Adam, she blames herself.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.793
She thinks there's
something wrong with her.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.127
She doesn't know
that really

11:36.129 --> 11:38.730
there's just something
very, very wrong with you.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.299
But I'm her hero.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.934
Maybe you should take the rap
on this one.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.737
I'm going, I'm going.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.005
(knocking)

11:48.842 --> 11:50.709
Hey, Katie.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.344
(clicks tongue)

11:56.116 --> 11:58.950
Look, honey, I know you think
this whole thing is your fault,

11:58.952 --> 12:00.719
but it isn't.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.287
The truth is...

12:02.289 --> 12:04.155
(sighs)

12:06.927 --> 12:11.429
The truth is, it's my...
feeling that it's Royce's fault.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.799
I mean, between saving
whales, walking dogs,

12:14.801 --> 12:17.202
he takes a selfie
every four seconds--

12:17.204 --> 12:19.838
he's just too into himself.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.040
How do you know
all that stuff about Royce?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.808
Uh...

12:23.810 --> 12:25.877
uh, that's a good question.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.279
I did not see that coming. Uh...

12:28.281 --> 12:31.783
What did you do?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.885
You know,
you are really starting

12:33.887 --> 12:35.954
to remind me of your mother.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.256
How'd it go?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.758
Not good.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.760
And now she knows
it's my fault.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.928
I blew it.
You know, from now on,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.930
you should just make
all the decisions.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.465
Wait.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.533
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.802
Say that into my phone.
Oh, come on.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.838
Come on.
How are we gonna fix this?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.440
(sighs): Well...

12:55.442 --> 12:57.175
it's simple.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.779
We are gonna make the
decision, together...

13:00.781 --> 13:03.014
to go down to
the mall and...

13:03.016 --> 13:04.949
bag a teenage boy
to date our daughter.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.485
Fine, I'll do it.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.187
But I still think he's a player.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.422
He's not a player.
And I have news for you,

13:11.424 --> 13:14.192
you are not a player anymore,
either-- you are a dad.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.560
(gasps)

13:15.562 --> 13:17.562
You take that back!
Oh, come on.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.498
Take it back.
Take it back.
No. No.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.033
I'm a player.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.334
Okay.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.871
What's in here?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.273
Okay, this is Marcy's
favorite room.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.208
I'm only allowed in here
on special occasions,

13:30.210 --> 13:31.810
or after a bath.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.578
But these are
her most precious things.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.547
If I'm gonna help you find
the perfect gift,

13:35.549 --> 13:37.348
I need to understand
what makes Marcy tick.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.285
Oh, well, that's easy--
it's Chardonnay and revenge.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.586
Oh, I love those plates.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.555
Whoa, whoa, we shouldn't
be on the carpet.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.390
We have to leave this place
exactly as it was.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.825
Marcy will see those footprints.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.861
I came up with
this technique

13:49.863 --> 13:52.263
to get to the M&M's
she keeps in here.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.898
Careful.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.366
Careful. No touching,
no touching.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.901
Hey, I recognize these.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.270
These are Criscioni
commemorative plates.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.973
There's one for each month,
and she's missing December.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.241
She'll love it!

14:03.243 --> 14:04.943
And I only have to buy
one plate.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.878
So I'll have enough
for a dirt bike.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.014
Okay, okay, she'll know

14:10.016 --> 14:11.883
if it's a little off.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.258
(gasping)

14:21.328 --> 14:22.927
Oh.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.872
Hey, sport.
(chuckles)

14:33.874 --> 14:35.607
I'm friends with the mall cop.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.942
Come on. Relax, Royce.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.578
What I said this morning
was wrong.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.579
I should have just

14:41.581 --> 14:42.881
stayed out of it.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.182
And I probably would have

14:44.184 --> 14:45.617
if you didn't have
such ridiculous hair.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.385
Do you even have a mirror
at home?
Oh, Adam.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.519
What? What?
Adam...

14:48.521 --> 14:50.221
Stay focused.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.923
Okay.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.925
(chuckles)

14:55.195 --> 14:58.897
Bottom line, Katie likes you
and you like her,

14:58.899 --> 15:01.099
so...

15:01.101 --> 15:03.334
please take her out.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.403
But you threatened
to bury me in the woods.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.905
You did what?

15:06.907 --> 15:09.173
He's paraphrasing.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.675
That's why
I cancelled.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.611
I would never come between
a father and a daughter.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.514
Oh, God,
this kid is great.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.283
Are you buying this crap?
He's playing you.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.417
Stop playing us.
Adam!

15:19.419 --> 15:20.318
No.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.186
No. No. I know who you are.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.922
Okay? I was a player, too.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.957
And still am.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.425
Okay?
Okay.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.960
But I've been outvoted.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.595
So here's what's
gonna happen.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.997
You are gonna date my daughter,
whether you like it or not.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.099
'Cause I know where you live,
I know where you work,

15:35.101 --> 15:37.435
I will dig a deep hole,
and I'll...
Okay, okay,

15:37.437 --> 15:39.203
okay, that's it,
that's enough, that's enough.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.204
Now...

15:40.206 --> 15:41.940
okay, what...

15:41.942 --> 15:44.175
Adam is trying to say is...

15:44.177 --> 15:46.210
we're just... we're really
impressed

15:46.212 --> 15:48.613
by how mature and-and
caring you are.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.015
Wrong.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.685
We just think you're
an incredibly nice kid.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.553
Doubt it.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.323
And we would be thrilled
if you dated Katie.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.525
(blows raspberry)
Adam!

16:00.527 --> 16:02.593
I'm gonna make you
wait in the car.

16:04.464 --> 16:09.067
So just, don't let us
spoil this for you.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.971
You know? So... what do you say?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.372
Okay, we'll go on the date.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.606
Oh, great!

16:15.608 --> 16:17.642
Surprise!
Hi. I'm Daphne.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.310
Royce's girlfriend.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.545
You must be his
grandparents.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.014
I've heard a lot about you.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.651
Excuse me?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.454
(louder): I said,
I've heard a lot about you.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.424
How dare you try to
date our daughter

16:33.426 --> 16:35.326
when you have a girlfriend!

16:35.328 --> 16:37.662
Wait, you asked
another girl out?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.997
I'm out of here.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.471
Listen to me, you...

16:46.473 --> 16:48.639
poofy-haired little rat.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.776
Get him, babe.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.746
I know where you live,
and I know where you work,

16:54.748 --> 16:57.248
and if you ever come
near our daughter again,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.282
I will come

16:58.284 --> 17:00.118
to the end of your rainbow

17:00.120 --> 17:02.086
and I will kick you
right in the tots.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.156
A little free advice:

17:05.158 --> 17:07.191
never be afraid
of the crazy one,

17:07.193 --> 17:10.428
be afraid of the one
the crazy one's afraid of.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.729
(chuckling)

17:22.675 --> 17:24.609
(exhales):
Whew!

17:24.611 --> 17:26.577
You know what?
Hmm?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.046
That was fun.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.047
(chuckles):
Yeah.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.581
I like doing stuff with you.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.350
Me, too.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.218
You're a way better goon
than Don.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.787
Aw.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.221
Mwah.
(chuckles)

17:37.223 --> 17:38.623
And, uh...

17:38.625 --> 17:40.191
I have to admit,

17:40.193 --> 17:42.760
you were right about Royce.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.129
Oh, wait, wait,
say that into my phone. Wait.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.067
You're guys not
going to believe it.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.369
Royce was dating some girl
from another school,

17:51.371 --> 17:53.104
and now she's blasting him
all over Instagram.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.138
It's epic.

17:54.140 --> 17:57.141
Yeah, we did that.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.843
What?
Yeah, yeah, we went
down to the mall

17:58.845 --> 18:00.478
to talk to Royce
about your date.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.413
Mm-hmm, yeah, and that's
when we met Daphne.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.748
Oh, my God!

18:03.750 --> 18:04.849
I can't believe
you guys would do that.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.185
That's-that's my personal life.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.219
Oh, Katie,
you're right,

18:08.221 --> 18:09.821
we didn't respect
your boundaries.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.156
And we never will.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.859
Yeah, it turns out
that the lesson

18:14.861 --> 18:16.194
from<i> Romeo and Juliet</i> is that

18:16.196 --> 18:18.463
the parents just
weren't strict enough.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.331
This is the worst apology ever.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.866
Oh, no, no,
it's not an apology.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.835
No, no, it's a warning
to any future boy

18:23.837 --> 18:26.637
that tries to date you.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.706
We're gonna cyber-stalk them,
and interrogate them.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.641
Yeah, and let them know
that, if they date you,

18:30.643 --> 18:32.677
we'll be watching.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.479
But if you do that,
no one will ever want to.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.181
Then we'll have done our job.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.282
(sighs)

18:40.120 --> 18:41.486
(chuckles)

18:42.522 --> 18:44.188
(sniffs, then groans)

18:44.190 --> 18:45.823
Oh.
(chuckles)

18:45.825 --> 18:48.259
Mwah.
(sniffs)

18:48.261 --> 18:51.762
You know, s-she'll make us
pay for this when we're old.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.231
Yeah.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.599
When the time comes,

18:54.601 --> 18:56.734
that one is gonna be
quick to pull the plug.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.811
I can't believe Marcy got you a
dirt bike for your anniversary.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.779
And that she can
bring it in here,

19:08.781 --> 19:10.681
but I had to leave my beer
in the hall.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.551
(chuckles)
It was the perfect place
to hide it last night

19:13.553 --> 19:16.487
because I knew Don wouldn't
dare come in this room.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.589
If you got Marcy another
fast food gift card,

19:18.591 --> 19:20.725
I suggest you ride off
on this thing right now.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.793
(chuckles)
Oh, no, no,
I love my girl.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.763
She's getting something
very special.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.732
Here you go, baby.
Oh!
(gasps)

19:27.734 --> 19:29.767
Hey, I thought
you broke those.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.270
I had to buy a whole
new set. Cost a fortune.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.273
(gasps) You got me
my missing plate!

19:35.275 --> 19:39.343
Honey, I never knew you
even noticed my Criscionis.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.946
Oh, baby, I love
your crispy ponies.
Oh.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.781
Okay.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.249
Aw.
(gasps)

19:45.251 --> 19:48.619
Now my collection
is complete.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.854
Okay, I can't wait anymore,

19:49.856 --> 19:51.422
I got to take this girl
for a spin.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.258
No!

19:58.798 --> 20:02.567
Uh... so does this mean I can
bring my beer in here now?
