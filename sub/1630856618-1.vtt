20:38.370 --> 20:40.772
a picture like this.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.313
Verdugo had
a high-stakes deal lined up.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.849
Supposed to make him a fortune.
Supposed to make him a fortune.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.652
But he got arrested before
the big deal went down.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.721
What was Verdugo selling?
What was Verdugo selling?

20:57.055 --> 20:59.291
Drugs?

20:59.358 --> 21:02.494
All I know is that a man called
El Barbón set up the deal.
All I know is that a man called
El Barbón set up the deal.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.563
He has beard, long hair.

Does El Barbón
have a real name?
Does El Barbón
have a real name?

21:11.603 --> 21:12.838

Portillo, Polito,
something with "P."

21:20.779 --> 21:23.849
You find Emil,
Verdugo won't be far.

He won't leave town
until he gets that money.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.597
Pia.
Pia.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.868
Can we talk for a second?
About what?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.636
I got a feeling
that you know more
I got a feeling
that you know more

21:44.703 --> 21:46.805
about Verdugo's whereabouts
than you're letting on.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.074
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

21:49.141 --> 21:50.308
Pia, we raided an apartment
across town.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.643
A neighborhood boy said that you

21:51.710 --> 21:52.944
had already been there
taking pictures.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.747
Little punk.
Little punk.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.583
Come on, talk to me.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.319
Are you finding any good leads
from the sources you're working?
Are you finding any good leads

22:01.386 --> 22:02.721

I'm booking a flight back home
to Miami tomorrow morning.
I'm booking a flight back home
to Miami tomorrow morning.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.629
Maybe I can get a job,
reenroll in school.

22:10.696 --> 22:13.065
What happened
this morning
What happened
this morning

22:13.131 --> 22:14.900
was all too much.

22:14.966 --> 22:17.669
And I'm running out of money.

22:17.736 --> 22:18.837
I can't spend
another ten years

22:18.904 --> 22:20.772
consumed with
such dark thoughts.
consumed with
such dark thoughts.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.774
It's not what my mother
would have wanted for me.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.643
You're definitely right
about that.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.546
Listen, you came closer
than anyone has in a decade
Listen, you came closer
than anyone has in a decade

22:27.612 --> 22:28.780
to finding Verdugo.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.649
Then why do I feel
like such a failure?

22:30.716 --> 22:32.884
Because you're tired, Pia.
Because you're tired, Pia.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.854
Go back to Florida,
go back to your life.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.556
I will do everything I can
I will do everything I can

22:37.622 --> 22:38.924
to make sure
he doesn't get away again.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.792
No promises.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.761
No.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.730
No promises, but I will try.
No promises, but I will try.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.900
Your mother would be really
proud of you, you know.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.943
You take care of yourself.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.583
HICKS:
Hey, listen to this.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.885
The explosive found outside
the station this morning?

23:06.952 --> 23:10.522
Forensics lab found a serial
number on the mortar shell.
Forensics lab found a serial
number on the mortar shell.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.791

that was detonated

23:12.858 --> 23:14.526
was a military armament?
was a military armament?

23:14.593 --> 23:16.628
Apparently an artillery truck
was hijacked

23:16.695 --> 23:17.863
last month near
the Guatemalan border.

23:17.929 --> 23:21.099
The thieves got away
with RPGs, mortars,

Altogether worth $2 million.

23:25.203 --> 23:26.972
A thermobaric vacuum bomb

23:27.038 --> 23:29.541
detonated in
a populated area would...

23:29.608 --> 23:30.842
It could kill thousands, yes.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.677
We think Verdugo
was behind the hijacking?
We think Verdugo
was behind the hijacking?

23:32.744 --> 23:33.845
No, we know it.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.547
The hijacker
killed during the robbery

23:35.614 --> 23:36.681
is named Leo Verdugo.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.150
It's one of
Verdugo's cousins.
It's one of
Verdugo's cousins.

23:38.216 --> 23:40.585
And the reason why Verdugo
was so hot to make the deal,

23:40.652 --> 23:41.920
it's the stolen weapons.

23:43.054 --> 23:43.989
Did you hear the latest?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.624
I was just filling her in.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.658
Sounds like weapons
you don't want

23:46.725 --> 23:47.959
falling into the wrong hands.

23:48.026 --> 23:48.927
OLVERA:
Verdugo must have been
about to sell them

23:48.994 --> 23:50.662
when he got arrested.
when he got arrested.

23:50.729 --> 23:51.930
Now that he's free,

23:51.997 --> 23:53.565
we think he's going
to plan to make the deal

23:53.632 --> 23:54.866
within the next 24 hours.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.735
How can you be so sure?
Because this man here?
How can you be so sure?
Because this man here?

23:56.802 --> 23:58.570
He flew in from
Guatemala yesterday.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.704
Emil Peralta.

Our biker ID'd him
as El Barbón.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.644
between Verdugo and
whoever's buying.

24:05.710 --> 24:06.645
He's based in Guatemala
but travels to Mexico City

every few months.
Sells black market liquor

24:09.648 --> 24:10.949
to local bars
and restaurants in the area.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.951
Keeps a very low profile.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.520
These are the spots he's rumored
to sell his products.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.556
And most likely frequents.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.624
Let's split up into pairs
and do stakeouts.

24:19.691 --> 24:20.859
All right.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.994
Tell the troops.
Yes, ma'am.

24:23.061 --> 24:24.830
-(bell ringing)
-(camera clicks)

24:28.700 --> 24:30.635

side of town either.

POWELL:
Roger.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.677
I know it's breakfast food,

24:38.743 --> 24:39.778
but it's the best
I can do in the park.

24:39.845 --> 24:41.780
Thanks. I'm starving.

24:41.847 --> 24:42.981
It's not as good
as my abuela's,

24:43.048 --> 24:45.584
but at least
you get to try them.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.853
Oh, my, it's like a funnel cake,

24:47.919 --> 24:49.855
only a thousand times better.
only a thousand times better.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.757

There's a lot of things
I like about this place.
There's a lot of things
I like about this place.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.664
You know, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing

if this manhunt
took a few more days.
if this manhunt
took a few more days.

25:07.706 --> 25:08.673
That's him.
That's Emil.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.875
Come on, this way.

I spot him headed west,
República de Guatemala.

He spotted us.

Move, move.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.043
(chuckles)

25:46.177 --> 25:47.712
We lost him.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.785
(elevator bell dings)
You speak to
Captain Olvera?

25:53.852 --> 25:55.720
Just hung up.
Just hung up.

25:55.787 --> 25:58.823
There were no

He's probably already back in
Guatemala City, for all we know.

Guatemala City, for all we know.

HICKS:
Now that we spooked
Verdugo's middleman,

26:05.697 --> 26:08.733
you think he still plans on
carrying out this weapons deal?
you think he still plans on
carrying out this weapons deal?

26:08.800 --> 26:09.868
There's one meeting
standing between

26:09.935 --> 26:11.036
Verdugo and a huge payday.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.704
And if his buyers
are paying,

nothing's stopping
Verdugo now.

Verdugo now.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.674

26:15.740 --> 26:18.743
We need to find out where
the hell this deal's going down.

If this were L.A.,
we'd be able to work some C.I.
If this were L.A.,

26:23.148 --> 26:25.850
Sir, I'm gonna make
a quick call.
Sir, I'm gonna make
a quick call.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.986

have to remind you

have to remind you

26:44.035 --> 26:45.837
that we're here in
a professional capacity.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.673
Gabriel was just nice enough

26:48.740 --> 26:50.008
to bring me a croissant
this morning.
Oh,
to bring me a croissant
this morning.
Oh,

26:50.075 --> 26:53.044
well, yeah. That's nice.

What? You don't believe me?
What? You don't believe me?

26:56.982 --> 26:58.817
No, it's, uh...

it's none of my business.
(chuckles) Look, frankly,
it's none of my business.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.957
You're right.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.094
I'm gonna catch
a ride in with Gabriel.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.129
So I'll just see you
at the station, Commander.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.900
HONDO:
Sir.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.736
Pia might've been close

to getting a tip on where
Verdugo's deal is happening.
to getting a tip on where
Verdugo's deal is happening.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.772
She said she'd meet us
at her hostel in an hour,

27:20.839 --> 27:22.073
before she leaves
for the airport.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.743
All right... let's go.

27:27.846 --> 27:30.081
Sorry, sir, but what made you
feel like Powell's love life

27:30.148 --> 27:31.883
was any of your concern?
was any of your concern?

27:31.950 --> 27:33.752
I don't know.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.688

reminded me of Molly.

You know, headstrong,
so capable but...

27:42.227 --> 27:44.095
I guess I...
I guess I...

27:44.162 --> 27:45.797
don't want to see her
have a fling

27:45.864 --> 27:46.965
and end up getting hurt.

27:48.867 --> 27:49.901
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

27:49.968 --> 27:52.670
Probably owe Powell
an apology.

27:52.737 --> 27:53.905
I'd say so.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.908
Pia should've been here by now.

Yeah.
Did you see her today?
Yeah.
Did you see her today?

What room was
she staying in?

she staying in?

28:15.994 --> 28:18.463

28:21.900 --> 28:23.001
Do you have security cameras?

28:23.068 --> 28:24.369
Not all of them are working,

but I can show you
what we have.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.806
That'll be fantastic.

Could you, uh...

cue it up to yesterday?
Yeah.
cue it up to yesterday?
Yeah.

28:31.576 --> 28:35.013
Can you just rewind
just a little bit back?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.781

That's her. That's Pia.

All her stuff's
still in the room.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.189
None of it's packed.

28:44.255 --> 28:45.390
Well, it seems like she made it

28:45.457 --> 28:47.459
back here safely last night.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.795
HONDO:
Do you have any idea
who that guy is?
HONDO:
Do you have any idea
who that guy is?

28:50.862 --> 28:51.896
Yeah, actually.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.431
People call him Boki.

28:53.498 --> 28:54.966
He's a, a desgraciado.

How you say "creep."

28:57.502 --> 28:58.770
He lives in his van in Tepito.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.105
He'll do anything for a dollar.

29:01.539 --> 29:04.342
HONDO:
Stop the video
right there for me.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.878
Zoom in.

29:07.712 --> 29:09.447
Commander, look,
he's got a gun.
HICKS: Yeah.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.815
If Pia was abducted,

29:10.882 --> 29:12.350
we're already working
on borrowed time.

Who?
The American girl
in the youth hostel.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.542
We know you followed
her in there last night.
