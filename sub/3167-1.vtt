[Silence]

00:09.610 --> 00:11.879
[Man] So, from all the stories
you've collected

00:11.912 --> 00:14.215
For your book,
would you say that,

00:14.248 --> 00:17.885
In general,
sex after kids is terrible?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.254
Yes!

00:22.823 --> 00:25.626
In fact, the jury is still out
as to whether or not

00:25.659 --> 00:27.928
Kids are good for marriages.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.197
Period.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.865
There's a psychological
study that says that

00:31.899 --> 00:35.836
83% of couples suffer some
form of moderate

00:35.869 --> 00:38.906
Or severe crisis after kids
come into the picture.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.243
[Chuckles]

00:42.276 --> 00:45.012
I would say then,
the answer is,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.715
Professionally speaking,
of course,

00:47.748 --> 00:50.751
That kids are not good
for your sex life.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.189
At all!

02:18.005 --> 02:19.106
Finally get her to sleep?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.008
Mm. Down like a clown,
Charlie Brown.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.009

- I'll drink to that.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.548
What's all this?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.383
Well, I thought it would
be nice for a change.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.818
Pretend we're adults, right?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.888
Are you trying
to seduce me?

02:34.922 --> 02:37.124
And you got some tomato
sauce on your chin, too...

02:37.157 --> 02:38.125
- actually.
- Oh.

02:39.393 --> 02:43.096
Babe, I'm covered in spit up
and I'm exhausted.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.667
Can we try, maybe tomorrow
or later this week?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.035
Yeah, sure.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.238
That'd be fine, sure.

You're mad.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.112
No, I'm not mad.
Why would I be mad?

02:59.146 --> 03:00.581
Because it's been a while.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.750
It hasn't been a while,
it's been a year.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
It has not been a year.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.187
Right, then it's been
359 days.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.290
And eleven hours.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.658

to start now, or...?

- Yep.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.441
Counts? As what?
That was two strokes.

[Exhales slowly]
Yes.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.866

count as moving?

Yes. So don't.

No no, but Sean,
I bought, I bought a dress.

06:08.902 --> 06:09.870
And shoes.

You call Gage or Larissa.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.537

I just... I just don't
understand it.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.358
I don't understand
how you can sit there

08:45.392 --> 08:47.961
While your child's heart is
breaking in the next room.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.396
His heart is not breaking.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.664
He's just pissed off

08:50.698 --> 08:52.065
That we're not rocking
him to sleep.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.602
Two nights. That's all
the book says it'll take.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.136
It's torture.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.739
We are not torturing him.

What're you doing?

09:14.421 --> 09:15.689
Ohh.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.158
Foreplay. It'll take
your mind off the cries.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.730
If I have sex with you while
our son is screaming

09:22.763 --> 09:24.497
In the next room, I'm forever
going to associate

09:24.531 --> 09:25.866
Intimacy with pain.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.035
Oh, well that's kind of hot,
isn't it?

What can go wrong?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.999
Everything can go wrong,
Pey.

09:59.032 --> 10:02.502
Every night I high five myself
just for keepin' her alive.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.005
Listen, I have TeleHealth
on speed dial.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.607
If you call though
you've got to ask for Marcy,

10:07.641 --> 10:10.410
She's nice and sort of
knows me a bit now.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.180

sort of threatens to call

Are you goin' out
dressed like that?

Yeah. Why?

10:19.887 --> 10:22.255
Oh, depends.
You want to get laid?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.624
I don't know.
I mean yeah, I suppose.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.159
I just wanna go out and
meet somebody nice,

10:26.193 --> 10:27.695
You know,
who might like me.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.829
Sort of test the waters a bit.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.897
You're a single mom,
you don't got

10:29.930 --> 10:31.699
Time to be fucking about.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.334
Go out there
and have some fun.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.769
Do you mean
like dodgeball?

10:35.803 --> 10:38.638
I mean like
gettin' fucking laid.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.442
Okay, well I mean, I sup... I
suppose I could give it a go.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.812
Have you seen my
diaphragm?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.314
'Course I haven't seen
your fucking diaphragm.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.916
Besides you're protected.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.617
You know,
your tits and whatnot.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
Wha-what do you mean?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.687
Oh, I was fuckin'
this bird back home

10:53.721 --> 10:54.822
And she said
she couldn't get pregnant

10:54.855 --> 10:56.356
While she was breastfeedin'.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.358
Saved a fortune
on condoms.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.161
Are condoms very
expensive now?

11:01.194 --> 11:03.063
You're missing the point
of the story, love.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.564
Right. Okay.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.870
[Dance music playing
on television]

11:13.907 --> 11:16.476
Yeah, so my father took off
when I was a baby,

11:16.509 --> 11:19.079
So there's a special place in
my heart for people like you.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.149
Nobody ran off on me.
I, I, I chose this, you know.

11:22.182 --> 11:22.783
Oh!

11:22.816 --> 11:24.684
Yeah, I knocked myself up.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.218
Yeah.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.453
I mean, well, no.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.155
I mean, I didn't
knock myself up.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.924
I went to one of those
sperm banks, you know.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.826
Well, spank banks
I think you call them.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.527
Well, I mean,
I don't know if you do, but...

11:34.561 --> 11:36.229
Anyway, I've always just
really wanted a family,

11:36.263 --> 11:38.966
You know, just, I've always
just sort of had this hole

11:38.999 --> 11:41.168
Inside of me that kinda
needed filling up,

11:41.201 --> 11:42.970
So I just, I thought
maybe a baby

11:43.003 --> 11:43.971
Could do that, you know.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.272
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
No, it's so true, they...

11:45.305 --> 11:47.040
I mean it's not, you know,
it's been different

11:47.074 --> 11:49.209
Than I expected, so...

11:49.242 --> 11:51.544
I mean don't get me wrong,
I love the baby to bits,

11:51.578 --> 11:53.513
I really do, you know, but...

11:53.546 --> 11:57.050
God, I mean they poop a lot,
don't they?

11:57.084 --> 11:59.920
And they suck.
It's all a lot of sucking.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.721
I mean, it's already eatin' me
out of house and home

12:01.755 --> 12:03.556
And it's only me boobs.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.893
So you know, here I am.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.594
Just kind of out and about.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.396
- Looking for love.
- Yeah, yeah...

12:09.429 --> 12:10.730
No! No, God, no.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.100
I'm not... no love for me just,
uh, just casual.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.035
You know, just gettin' out.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.636
Yeah, I mean, God,
who in their right mind's

12:16.669 --> 12:17.938
Looking for a single mom?

12:17.971 --> 12:21.274
You know, I mean maybe
a pedophile, I suppose.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.076
Not that you're a pedophile.
Are you?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.477
No!

12:24.511 --> 12:25.478
So you know...

12:25.512 --> 12:26.914
I mean, my brother
put it best, you know,

12:26.947 --> 12:28.381
He put it like:

12:28.415 --> 12:30.483
The hole I need fillin' up
is probably

12:30.517 --> 12:31.985
Not an emotional one.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.421
You know,
it's a... a different hole...

12:34.454 --> 12:35.622
Your brother told you this?

12:35.655 --> 12:37.958
Yeah. Yeah.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.328
And, good news is,
we don't need a condom.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.063
Because of me tits.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.666
So. We just, ah,
we just do it...

12:49.536 --> 12:50.737
[Nervous giggle]

12:58.178 --> 12:59.813
- God!
- Oh!

12:59.847 --> 13:03.283
Oh, fuck! Oh!

13:03.316 --> 13:04.617
- Oh, god!
- Shh.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.019
You're gonna,
you're gonna wake her,
you're gonna wake her.

13:06.053 --> 13:09.422
Oh, God, it's so fucking hot
that you're a Dad.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.790
- Oh!
- Thanks.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.526
Oh, god. Oh, fuck.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.862
Oh, fuck. Turn me over.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.165
Yeah. Oh God.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.333
[Whispers]
Oh, fuck.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.535
Oh, god.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.737
Oh.

Oh, God.

Oh, god yeah!

13:29.609 --> 13:31.311
Oh, punish me, daddy.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.212
Oh, fuck.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.146
Smack my ass.

13:33.180 --> 13:33.881
- Smack your ass?
- Yeah!

13:33.914 --> 13:34.882
Oh, punish me.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.017
Oh, punish me, daddy.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.318
Fuck me, daddy!

13:38.351 --> 13:39.452
Oh, punish me.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.688
I love the way
you fuck me, daddy!

13:41.721 --> 13:42.822
- Oh!
- Okay, okay.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.391
I can't do this.
I'm out. I'm out.

[Baby crying]

13:47.327 --> 13:50.363
Oh, please will you just give
Uncle Peyton a break.
Look...

13:50.397 --> 13:53.200
I could smother you and you
wouldn't even know it.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.534
I didn't mean that.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.169
I love you, honestly,
to pieces,

13:56.203 --> 13:59.706
But will you please
just shut the fuck up!

13:59.739 --> 14:02.009
Pey? You all right?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.311
[Baby crying]

14:04.344 --> 14:05.678
How do I turn her off?

14:07.114 --> 14:10.350
You mean they're not
supposed to scream bloody
murder all the time?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.786
[Sighs]

14:14.654 --> 14:15.822
Are you sure this is

14:15.855 --> 14:17.757
How you're supposed
to put her to sleep?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.327
It's not so bad, you know,
once you get used to it like.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.930
I don't know whether
I could ever put up with that.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.697
It makes me
want to eat glass.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.333
You know what Lou,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.136
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to stay here.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.203
Well, what are you
going to do?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.371
You going to go buy a house

14:31.404 --> 14:33.340
With all your inheritance
money you pissed away?

14:33.373 --> 14:36.176
Hey, there's no need to be
a bitch about it, all right.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.712
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Pey,
I didn't mean that.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.081
Stay.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.282
Be my nanny.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.850
- Fuck off.
- No, come on.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.285
It's free room and board.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.854
No seriously, fuck off,
I'm just passing through.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.689
I've got plans.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.092
Besides, what d'you need
a Nanny for anyway?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.196
Well, it's harder than I
thought it was gonna be...

doin' it on my own...

See, it's not so hard.

Why are you back
so early anyway?

15:09.476 --> 15:10.710
I don't know.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.045
Couldn't close the deal, eh?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.380
You see,
you were searching

15:13.413 --> 15:15.048
For the wrong type of man.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.985
What you need is a sexual
deviant, you know?

Someone who'll smash
your back doors in

15:20.453 --> 15:22.622
And walk away
without a second thought.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.558
You know,
maybe you're right.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.793
Maybe I should just give up

15:26.826 --> 15:28.461
On all this love
and fulfillment lark.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.164
I mean, it's never done me
any favors, has it?

and rejection.

That's it.

No more love for me.
Only lust for this trollop.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.010

I'm gonna get out there
and I'm gonna get someone

To really give it to me.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.547

someone who'll say,

15:47.580 --> 15:48.515
"Who's your Daddy"

15:48.548 --> 15:50.417
And really smash in my side
door...

15:50.450 --> 15:52.585
- Your back door...
- My back door!

15:52.619 --> 15:53.620
Yeah.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.325
How do I find
a social deviant?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.459
What, what do I do?

15:59.492 --> 16:02.429
Well you know, basically
you gotta clearly indicate

16:02.462 --> 16:04.097
What you will
and you won't do, all right?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.699
Um... dirty Sanchez.
Strawberry sundae.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.700
That sort of thing.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.836
Okay, well Strawberry
Sundae sounds all right.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.204
How's that work?

16:11.238 --> 16:13.473
Well, it's when you release
your demons

16:13.506 --> 16:16.309
Into the lady's face, and you
know, when she can't see,

16:16.343 --> 16:18.945
You smash her one in the
nose.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.680
Strawberry Sundae.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.615
That's awful.

16:22.649 --> 16:26.253
Who would do such a thing
to another human being?

16:27.687 --> 16:30.823
Oh, Peyton!
Don't do that to someone!

16:30.857 --> 16:32.292
She asked me too...

16:32.325 --> 16:34.494
Oh. Well.
I suppose if she asked.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.662
Yeah.

16:40.100 --> 16:40.967
How old is he?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.335
Two and a half.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.503
Aw.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.307
So, do you mind if I ask
how you two met?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.975
- Online.
- A bookstore.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.543
We, we actually met online

16:50.577 --> 16:52.912
But it embarrasses her
to say that, so...

16:52.945 --> 16:55.315
No, no! That's amazing.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.651
I just always assumed that
online dating was for losers.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.487
No, you're not losers!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.823
[Stammering]
I loved it.
I order everything online, so.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.325
Order, seriously?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.693
Really?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.829
So which one of you gave
birth, then?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.699
Excuse me? Which one
of you is the real mom?

17:12.732 --> 17:13.866
Oh, uh...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.234
We both are.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.905
Maybe one of us carried him
in her womb, you know.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.208
Maybe... maybe we both
adopted him.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.442
Maybe one of us...

17:22.474 --> 17:24.344
Donated an egg and the
other one carried it.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.846
Doesn't really matter,
we're both raising the child

17:26.878 --> 17:28.281
And we're committed
to his well-being

17:28.315 --> 17:30.917
Which makes us both
real moms.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.119
Yeah.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.887
I'm sorry. I just... I didn't
mean to offend you.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.689
I just don't...

17:36.723 --> 17:39.359
Know the, the protocol
for people in your situation.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.562
Our situation?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.464
It's, it's funny cause it's not
actually a situation,

17:44.497 --> 17:46.666
We are... we're lesbians.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.235
It's our family.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.802
Are you retarded?

17:49.836 --> 17:50.903
No...

17:50.937 --> 17:52.372
We should go to the park
more often.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.273
Who the fuck
still talks like...

17:53.306 --> 17:54.541
Hey hey, language.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.376
Who the fiddlesticks
still talks like that?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.978
"People in your situation."
Say lesbian!

17:59.011 --> 18:00.980
Hell, say dyke, for all I care.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.250
You know it's over, right
babe?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.984
I know.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.293
Maybe it's not such a terrible
question, though. I mean...

18:15.828 --> 18:17.230
Maybe one of us should be
more Mom

18:17.264 --> 18:19.466
And then the other
more Dad.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.003
And if so, I call Mom.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.673
Why, so you can have the
monopoly on being cute?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.007
I like pink.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.477
No. Look. One of our
strengths as a couple

18:30.510 --> 18:34.147
Is how different we are.
Maybe, um...

18:34.181 --> 18:36.516
Maybe we should
embrace that.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.751
Give him a little bit
more structure.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.287
You sound like a pamphlet.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.688
Cunt.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.889
Language!

18:42.922 --> 18:45.024
Oh, no, that's not a swear,
it's an actual body part...

18:45.057 --> 18:46.626
[Laughs]

18:46.659 --> 18:48.195
Okay, it's a swear,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.664
But you were being
a bit of a cunt.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.699
Ah! Hey, hey, hey!

18:52.732 --> 18:56.336
We are gentle with people
and things.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.337
We are...

18:57.370 --> 18:59.806
[Together]
Gentle with people
and things.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.074
Except when
we're being a cunt.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.946
* The wipers on the bus go,
swish, swish, swish,

19:06.979 --> 19:10.116
* all through the town.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.486
* The people on the bus go
Hi, Hi, Annie

19:13.520 --> 19:14.921
- Honey.
- Hey, honey!

19:14.954 --> 19:15.988
You're home early.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.525
Yeah! Uh, where's the baby?

19:18.558 --> 19:19.826
Oh, she's upstairs napping.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.361
So you were just singing
that to yourself?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.732
It got stuck in my head?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.567
Okay, let's go with that.
Um...

19:27.600 --> 19:28.668
I've got a little surprise
for you.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.636
Oh!

19:29.669 --> 19:30.803
I like surprises.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.071
Okay, just a second...

19:32.972 --> 19:33.940
Come on in.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.347
Nice to meet you.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.918
So to summarize, the issue
is that when Jules

19:45.952 --> 19:47.920
Is in the mood,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.590
It's always during the day
when Ben is at work,

19:50.623 --> 19:54.160
And when Ben comes home,
you are simply exhausted.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.462
Exactly. Yep.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.430
What about the weekends?

19:57.464 --> 19:59.065
Oh no, That's... that's when
stuff's getting done

19:59.098 --> 20:00.333
- around the house.
- Yes. No...

20:00.367 --> 20:02.335
- We have to do laundry...
- Lot of things, yeah...

20:02.369 --> 20:03.936
- And shopping. And laundry.
- Right.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.004
There's a lot of laundry.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.506
Yeah. It's not uncommon.

20:08.275 --> 20:12.745
But what most couples don't
realize is that, on average,

20:12.779 --> 20:16.616
Seven to twenty minutes is
all it takes to have sex.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.885
Less time than laundry.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.688
I'm sorry, are you criticizing
the way that I do laundry?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.089
- Ooh.
- Because, um...

20:23.122 --> 20:25.492
- I pre-soak my cloth diapers
- Yeah.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.693
- So...
- It's pretty important.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.661
- Presoaking is kinda crucial.
- Yeah, it takes a long...

20:28.695 --> 20:29.529
- The stains will cake right in
- longer but...

20:29.562 --> 20:30.963
- And I think...
- It's an investment.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.065
I think he gets it. No one's
saying it's a bad idea.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.100
[Overlapping dialogue]

20:34.133 --> 20:35.635
No, no, no. I'm saying,

20:35.668 --> 20:38.405
I'm saying that I just want
both of you to be aware

20:38.438 --> 20:42.842
Of each other's investment,

20:42.875 --> 20:44.444
You know?

20:44.477 --> 20:45.978
I mean be Ben is...

20:46.012 --> 20:48.381
Clearly, sexually...

20:48.415 --> 20:51.684
Frustrated, aren't you Ben?

20:51.718 --> 20:54.321
It's be... it's been a year.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.655
No. No!

20:55.688 --> 20:56.656
The other night...

20:56.689 --> 20:57.657
- Oh, that thing, you do not,
- We had sex.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.658
You do not get to count that.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.759
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I count it.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.394
- Nope.
- It counts.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.795
- A year.
- Yeah.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.531
And your baby's
six months old.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.632
Right.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.668
Well, my gynecologist said
that it couldn't hurt

21:08.701 --> 21:11.103
To abstain from sex
during pregnancy.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.672
What did your dentist say?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.106
Okay...

21:14.140 --> 21:15.642
What did your
proctologist say?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.243
- Oh, he says you're gross.
- Okay.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.012
He comes... he comes up
with a good question.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.682
There's a difference
between

21:22.715 --> 21:24.584
Abstaining from vaginal sex

21:24.617 --> 21:27.820
And sexual contact
all together.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.188
Now...

21:30.657 --> 21:32.825
Let me ask you...

21:32.859 --> 21:35.027
Do you have a reason...

21:35.061 --> 21:38.531
For avoiding fellating your
husband?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.403
Mother's don't fellate.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.804
- Yes, they do.
- No they don't.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.806
What? There's a, there's
a whole genre of porn...

21:46.839 --> 21:48.274
- devoted to that very idea.
- Ohh...

21:48.307 --> 21:51.744
Now, I... I'm gon... I'm going
to suggest something here

21:51.778 --> 21:54.180
That I suggest
to all my clients.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.315
For one hundred
days

21:56.349 --> 21:58.618
I want you
to have sex every day.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.186
I haven't done that
since college.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.388
When...

22:01.421 --> 22:03.356
Did you do that in college?
We were together in college.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.891
Not the whole time.

22:05.758 --> 22:06.859
Um.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.294
When we...

22:08.327 --> 22:11.764
Have sex and I have this...
burning sensation.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.966
It just, it doesn't go away.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.168
Oh, there's a pamphlet for
that...

22:16.202 --> 22:20.440
I want you to, to treat this
hundred days like exercise.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.310
It doesn't sound like
a great idea at the time,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.479
And we always make
excuses for not doing it,

22:26.513 --> 22:28.347
But once you start -

22:28.381 --> 22:29.549
It's good.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.985
And when you really get into
it - it's pleasant, really.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.487
Pleasant.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.522
What do you say, honey?

22:35.555 --> 22:37.089
You want get into
something...

22:37.123 --> 22:39.025
Pleasant with me?

22:39.058 --> 22:40.192
- Sure.
- Yeah?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.193
Yeah.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.395
We'll still do the laundry
though, right?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.396
Yes, we'll still do the laundry.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.864
Okay, good. I just put a fresh
load in.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.199
Yeah, well, I would like
to put a fresh load in

22:47.233 --> 22:49.068
Myself, from time to time.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.136
Okay...

22:50.169 --> 22:51.904
She served it up, Doc. It's
a...

22:51.938 --> 22:53.506
But you don't have to bring
it-

22:53.540 --> 22:54.507
Put a "fresh load" in.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.208
[Stammering]
Did you want another cup...

22:56.242 --> 22:57.577
[Together]
Coffee?

22:57.610 --> 22:58.578
No. Thank you.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.412
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:00.947 --> 23:01.981
Oh...

23:02.014 --> 23:04.851
He's so cute!
How do you stand it?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.887
Oh, the incessant screaming
helps balance it out nicely.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.221
[Straining]

23:09.255 --> 23:11.057
There's my little Oopsie.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.793
I've been meaning
to ask you...

23:13.826 --> 23:15.595
Why do you call him
"Oopsie"?

23:15.628 --> 23:18.731
Oh, it's just Sean's
nickname for him.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.534
You were a big surprise,
weren't you, baby?

23:21.568 --> 23:23.903
I've missed seeing you
on television.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.238
Oh! Thank you
for saying that!

23:26.272 --> 23:28.340
You know, Horton and I
were both very surprised

23:28.374 --> 23:29.976
That you didn't
go back to the show

23:30.009 --> 23:32.044
After your maternity leave.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.379
It was the baby weight,
right?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.281
Oh god, no. I've lost all the
baby weight.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.984
Oh. Of course you have.

23:41.153 --> 23:45.625
No, I, ah, I just decided that
it was just important

23:45.658 --> 23:47.560
To stay home
to raise this little guy.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.228
And Sean makes more than
enough for both of us,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.898
So just, why bother with all
of the drama, you know?

23:51.931 --> 23:52.965
So...

23:52.999 --> 23:56.703
How's being a full-time Mom
working out for you?

23:56.736 --> 24:00.006
Well, uh, I um...

24:00.039 --> 24:01.708
I've lost my mind,

24:01.741 --> 24:02.675
Is what's happened.

24:02.709 --> 24:03.843
[Nervous laughter]

24:03.876 --> 24:06.679
I've always thought that,
if I was ever going to have

24:06.713 --> 24:10.983
A, just a dirty, nasty little
thing, I would...

24:11.017 --> 24:13.085
Keep it in a closet until I
needed it for a charity event

24:13.119 --> 24:16.823
Or something. But! I've gone
Full Metal Stepford here.

24:16.856 --> 24:20.660
His birthday party had: a
strict formal dress code,

24:20.693 --> 24:25.665
There was 82 handmade gift
bags, a $5,000 candy table,

24:25.698 --> 24:26.833
12 different kinds of
sandwiches

24:26.866 --> 24:30.169
Including the swordfish
canapé, which was lovely.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.804
Looks like you covered
everything.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.205
Yeah, no yeah yeah.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.206
[Baby babbling]

24:34.240 --> 24:36.809
Everything,
except, uh, other kids.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.711
You forgot to invite
other children?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.314
We don't know
any other children.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.517
Oh. I see.

24:44.551 --> 24:48.755
So, uh, how are things here
with the empty nest?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.489
Must be like a second
honeymoon around here.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.724
Oh...

24:53.860 --> 24:56.128
Well, we're not all
as young and sexy

24:56.162 --> 24:57.630
As you are, you know.

24:58.665 --> 25:02.168
I just... I don't find her
attractive anymore.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.137
I think I traded in low cuts
and long legs for...

25:05.171 --> 25:07.373
Sweat pants
and breast milk stains.

25:07.406 --> 25:11.010
That'll all go away. You guys
are still having sex, right?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.946
[Laughs]

25:13.980 --> 25:17.183
Don't get me started. She's
insatiable. It's ridiculous.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.385
You should get
some real problems.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.921
Do you know when
the last time I even saw
Dolores naked was?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.389
I had hair.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.892
I don't even know
what we are anymore.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.860
Friends, I suppose...

25:27.894 --> 25:31.230
Well, c'mon, seriously,
you're still young, you know.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.632
And you had a good run
at it.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.067
You brought up
three amazing kids.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.169
There's no, there's no
shame in calling it a day

25:37.203 --> 25:38.938
If the passion's gone.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.674
Sean. She is the mother
of my children.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.876
Yeah. But they're gone.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.078
Right?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.418
So your penis is still actually
in this girl when you decide

25:52.451 --> 25:53.953
That you never want
to see her again?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.755
She called me "Daddy".

25:55.788 --> 25:57.223
- Ooh.
- [Laughs]

25:57.256 --> 26:00.259
Okay, so um,
couldn't you just say:

26:00.292 --> 26:02.061
"Please don't
call me Daddy"?

26:02.094 --> 26:03.195
I mean, that's what adults
do, right?

26:03.229 --> 26:05.531
They communicate.
They just don't pull out.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.599
It's true, actually.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.736
Larissa never has a problem
telling me exactly,

26:09.769 --> 26:11.971
Specifically what it is
that I'm doing wrong.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.539
I believe you.

26:13.572 --> 26:17.610
Well, okay, that's because I
want to be in a relationship.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.978
Gage is just looking to have
a good time.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.046

26:24.617 --> 26:25.785
He's okay. Look.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.419
What are you trying
to say about me, huh?

26:29.521 --> 26:31.290
Okay, um.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.659
You...

26:32.692 --> 26:34.994
Knowingly choose imperfect
women

26:35.027 --> 26:37.429
So that you can use it as
an excuse to get rid of them

26:37.463 --> 26:39.265
When you get bored.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.100
That's really shitty, Larissa.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.902
Oh, it is
without a doubt shitty.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.637
I don't do that.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.773
Why did you break up
with that, uh, teacher?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.609
She had to go to bed too
early.

26:50.643 --> 26:51.978
The waitress?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.547
She stayed up way too late.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.019
So wait, you're saying
that I'm the problem?

27:00.052 --> 27:01.087
Look.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.121
He's having a moment.

Oh, come on honey,

Prove us wrong.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.129
Find yourself a nice,
normal woman

27:10.162 --> 27:11.964
And give her an actual shot.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.134
Yeah, and where does one
find a "nice normal" woman?

Yeah. Yes it is.

Uh, do you want to do this
in the bedroom?

27:35.855 --> 27:36.889
Yeah, it's probably
most comfortable.

27:36.923 --> 27:37.857
Okay.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.058
Yeah, just have to brush my
teeth first.

27:39.091 --> 27:39.792
Really?

27:39.826 --> 27:40.760
Yeah, I mean, well...

27:40.793 --> 27:42.161
We're probably gonna
kiss and stuff, right?

27:42.194 --> 27:43.162
Right. Right, yeah.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.363
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:44.396 --> 27:47.700
Okay, um... Oh, did you want
shirt on or off? Were you...

27:47.734 --> 27:49.936
Like, were you, are you
gonna fondle my nipples...

27:49.969 --> 27:52.404
I didn't really have any
nipple plans, per say.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.040
Right. It turns you on,
though, right?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.608
Well, yeah, but I thought
turned you on too.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.444
You could light my nipples
on fire right now

27:58.477 --> 28:00.246
And I would not feel it.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.081
[Clears throat]

28:02.114 --> 28:03.082
Mmmm.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.183
Yeah?

28:04.216 --> 28:06.052
- That's good.
- Good.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.220
You're so...

28:08.254 --> 28:09.688
You're so beautiful.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.523
Thanks.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.425
[Breathing heavily]

28:13.459 --> 28:14.693
Yeah.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.997
It's... it's kind of like you're
trying to put out a small fire.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.598
Yeah? Cause it's hot?

28:19.631 --> 28:21.667
No, it's just cause you're,
you're punching me now.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.035
You're just punching me
right in the dick.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.004
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- Yeah.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.505
- Just
- It's okay.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.374
Why is it sometimes
you're so rock hard

28:28.407 --> 28:31.677
And then other days you're
like an old woman's breast.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.613
Okay, your dirty talk needs
a lot of work.

28:34.646 --> 28:35.681
Okay, do you want me,

28:35.714 --> 28:36.983
Should I fellate you,
or something?

28:37.016 --> 28:39.551
Can you think of a less sexy
way to ask me that?

28:39.585 --> 28:40.586
How can I get you get hard?

28:40.619 --> 28:41.788
I don't know.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.523
There's all this pressure
now.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.158
I know, right?!

28:47.393 --> 28:49.428
I, I, I can't do
all this pre-planning.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.898
I need this to be
spontaneous.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.565
Feel like I'm doing chores.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.434
Oh, I need to put the dry...
Laundry in the dry...

28:55.467 --> 28:57.369
Can we please not talk
about laundry, right now?

28:57.403 --> 28:58.504
Okay, seriously...

28:58.537 --> 28:59.471
Okay.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.739
Look, we have to get
through this, all right?

29:00.773 --> 29:01.841
- I know.
- Somehow.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.410
A hundred consecutive
days.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.245
It's supposed to be fun!

29:06.278 --> 29:08.514
Well, he didn't say
when we had to start.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.717
We could start tomorrow.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.085
Yeah, exactly.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.487
Okay. Good talk.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.722
Yeah?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.723
Yeah. Go team.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.757
Mmm.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.065
So are we gonna put the
clothes in the dryer?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.300
Yeah, I got it. I got it. Okay.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.942
Hon?

29:38.777 --> 29:39.946
Hon?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.714
How was your day?

30:00.099 --> 30:01.800
Hey Daddy...

30:01.834 --> 30:04.503
Hey... Mama?

30:04.536 --> 30:05.471
Wow.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.207
I finally fit into my lingerie.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.542
Yeah. More or less, yeah.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.546
Is Oops asleep?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.315
He's at, uh, grandma's.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.653
Oof. I, uh, I had a long day.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.556
Great.
Let's have a long night.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.524
I just want to grab
something.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.193
I'm a little peckish.

30:27.226 --> 30:31.263
I've got something for you
to snack on right here.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.631
Yeah...

30:32.664 --> 30:35.167
Um, no, I was, I was...

30:35.201 --> 30:36.702
Something with protein,
that's what I was thinking...

30:36.735 --> 30:39.205
Sean. Listen, my, uh...

30:39.238 --> 30:42.174
My ego is holding on
by a thread, here okay?

30:42.208 --> 30:45.444
I have had enough of
bitches in the park,

30:45.477 --> 30:46.979
That's where the real bitches
are, okay?

30:47.013 --> 30:49.648
Talking about how to get
their kids to go to sleep

30:49.681 --> 30:51.017
And what kind of
apple sauce to eat,

30:51.050 --> 30:54.820
And, and preservatives and...
You know, I don't give a shit.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.088
I just...

30:56.122 --> 30:57.957
Want to feel like an woman.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.530
Alrighty then.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.764
[Clears throat]

[Moaning]

31:10.536 --> 31:11.537
What?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.439
Nothing, honey.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.411
Did you let the cat
in here?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.947
No. Why?

31:20.980 --> 31:23.749
Really?
It smells like rancid urine.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.518
I don't, I don't smell
anything.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.420
I'm not crazy.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.521
It must have
permeated the cover,

31:29.555 --> 31:30.822
We'll have to burn it.

31:36.462 --> 31:37.796
What?

31:37.829 --> 31:39.398
It's you!

31:39.431 --> 31:42.568
Did you get sprayed by a
skunk, or something?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.336
It's hormonal!

31:44.370 --> 31:47.006
What?! How come I've
never noticed that before?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.607
Because I put a ridiculous
amount of effort

31:48.640 --> 31:50.742
Into not perspiring
around you.

31:50.776 --> 31:55.214

31:55.247 --> 31:57.816

That feels great.
That's really good.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.523
That feels great.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.227
No no no. Don't touch
my kangaroo pouch.

32:11.263 --> 32:16.435
[Strained moaning]

32:21.573 --> 32:22.508
No, I need a time-out.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.542
- The smell.
- Don't you dare.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.144
- I'm so goddamn close.
- Just a minute.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.746
I can't stand the smell,
I'm going to be sick...

32:27.779 --> 32:29.948
No, c'mon! Just seven more
thrusts. Man up!

32:31.483 --> 32:32.651
- Come on.
- I'm on fire.

32:32.684 --> 32:33.719
Hurry up!

32:33.752 --> 32:34.686
- Four... three...
- I'm gonna be sick!

32:34.720 --> 32:36.422
- Nyah!
- No, I'm gonna be sick.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.592
Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!
Nyah! Nyah!

32:40.626 --> 32:42.794
Ohh!

32:46.632 --> 32:48.634
That was amazing.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.640
How long do you think
before you can go again?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.775
[Retching]

32:56.808 --> 32:58.644
[Cat meowing]

33:18.330 --> 33:20.166
I think we need
to have a talk.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.801
Sure.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.604
Can you, do you remember
that bright yellow piece...

33:25.637 --> 33:26.872
- that we had...
- Dolores.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.408
Oh, it's serious.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.044
Well...

33:32.078 --> 33:34.480
The other night I asked you
if you wanted to have,

33:34.513 --> 33:35.347
You know.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.016
And um,
you laughed in my face.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.587
Well...

33:41.620 --> 33:43.489
I thought you were joking,
honey.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.691
Why would I joke
about that?

33:45.724 --> 33:46.892
Because we
never have sex...

33:46.925 --> 33:48.260
Exactly.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.333
Are you unhappy, Horton?

33:54.366 --> 33:55.901
Um...

33:55.934 --> 33:58.704
[Stammers]
I think so.

33:58.737 --> 33:59.738
You know, I, I have needs.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.607
And I have to make sure
those needs are met.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.677
So if you've decided that you
don't like having sex...

34:05.711 --> 34:07.045
I love sex!

34:07.079 --> 34:08.813
Then why aren't we
having it?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.817
Okay.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.087
To be frank, it's...

34:16.755 --> 34:18.556
It got a little boring.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.992
The same thing over and
over and over again,

34:21.025 --> 34:23.762
I mean, you, you, you
had no focus.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.364
There was no attention
to what I needed.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.833
A woman needs...

34:28.867 --> 34:30.335
Certain things...

34:30.369 --> 34:32.737
Done to her, to build...

34:32.771 --> 34:37.042
Up to, slowly build up
to a climax.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.245
You mean you've never had
an orgasm?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.981
No, I have orgasms
all the time,

34:43.014 --> 34:45.384
I just never have them
with you.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.053
Not even when
I touched your "spot"?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.721
Oh, honey...

34:49.755 --> 34:54.426
Where "the spot" is and, and
where you thought it was...

34:54.460 --> 34:56.628
Worlds apart.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.397
Well how the hell
was I suppose to know?!

It's not like it comes
with GPS.

some breakfast.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.468
- Morning Dada.
- Good morning.

Oh, it was a super
awesome sentiment.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.645
It was a lovely gesture!

that's your thing, not mine.

a pop-culture ignoramus.

and shit.

all over the keyboard

button he could push.

or I lock him in the closet.

the last time was that

kittens and rainbows,

to my work.

a baby-sitter.

could take a look at these.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.298
Oh. Sure.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.334
These are... okay,
that's you naked.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.669
They're boudoir photos.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.303
I need to pick three
and get them blown-up.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.038
Um, for what?

38:28.239 --> 38:29.240
For fun.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.310
So do you like this-

38:32.344 --> 38:33.345
No! Hey! Okay.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.946
Come on! You didn't
even look at them.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.882
That's, that's
completely inappropriate.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.784
Why? It's just a naked body.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.318
Have you never seen
a woman's naked body
before?

38:40.352 --> 38:42.354
Not an employees, no.
I um-

38:42.388 --> 38:44.890
Oh look, you're... you're
turned on.

38:44.923 --> 38:49.661
Okay, that's...
You know what? That's uh...

38:49.695 --> 38:51.196
Don't be embarrassed.

38:51.229 --> 38:52.664
You're supposed to get
aroused.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.199
Wow.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.234
I think you're a cutie.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.004
Um...

38:59.037 --> 39:00.806
[Cell phone rings]

39:00.839 --> 39:03.875
Oh! I got, I got a phone call.
I gotta take this.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.544
I need you to look at these
later.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.812
It's my wife.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.847
Whatever.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.951
[Cell phone
continues ringing]

39:14.420 --> 39:15.153
Hi honey.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.955
I'm horny.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.123
Excuse me?

39:18.156 --> 39:21.126
Ooh, I'm standing against a
vibrating washing machine.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.894
You have no idea how good
this feels.

39:22.928 --> 39:23.895
Are you kidding me
right now?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.897
Oof, can you talk dirty
to me?

39:25.931 --> 39:26.565
- No. I...
- Hey, Ben!

39:26.598 --> 39:27.899
- Please.
- Hey Jeff!

39:27.933 --> 39:29.568
- Please, please, please.
- I'm at work!

39:29.601 --> 39:30.869
You are a bad girl.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.337
Yeah. Yeah,
just like that, yeah.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.540
No. No, I mean like
you are a bad...

39:34.573 --> 39:36.442
Naughty girl, Okay?
This is torture for me.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.510
Yeah, tell me
how naughty I am.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.545
- Oooh.
- No. No, no, no.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.679
I'm not participating in this,
okay?

39:40.712 --> 39:41.947
This is doing nothing for me.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.882
Mhmm. Yeah, keep going.

39:43.915 --> 39:44.883
- Okay, I hate you right now.
- Oh, baby. Don't stop.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.384
You know that? You're
gonna give me blue balls

39:46.418 --> 39:47.753
Because of this. I'm going to
be walking around

39:47.786 --> 39:49.455
With a twinge in my nut sack
all day.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.689
Oh!

39:51.322 --> 39:52.491
Mmmm.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.592
I just want you to know
that this has been

39:53.625 --> 39:54.793
A horrible experience for me.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.894
Oh, that's great babes.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.631
No, you know what, I'm
gonna come home at lunch.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.434
I can't. I've got Moms Group.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.335
You are a terrible person.

40:04.369 --> 40:05.303
Love you too.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.337
Hey...

40:16.014 --> 40:20.185
**

40:27.092 --> 40:28.193
Okay.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.801
Did Lou tell you guys
the one about Mr. Funny?

40:35.834 --> 40:36.802
I haven't heard it.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.037
No, no, no. Nobody
needs to hear that.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.005
Come on,

40:40.038 --> 40:41.673
Lou, do it
for the new guy.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.575
No. It was just...

40:43.609 --> 40:47.078
Lou has discovered her
post-baby sexuality.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.781
I swear to God, you
have got to write a blog.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.782
Do it!

40:50.816 --> 40:52.984
I met, I met this bloke online.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.320
And he seemed like a very
nice guy, you know,

40:55.353 --> 40:57.823
So I, I agreed to have him
pick me up for a date.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.858
And so, he made you
laugh a lot?

40:59.891 --> 41:00.826
Not really, no.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.494
So, why do you call him Mr.
Funny?

41:02.528 --> 41:04.062
No, that's actually his name.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.831
He's, you know,
he's a professional clown

41:05.864 --> 41:06.832
For a living.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.433
[Laughter]

41:08.466 --> 41:10.201
I mean, I think, I think
he was nervous

41:10.235 --> 41:12.037
Because he got in
and he just,

41:12.070 --> 41:13.772
He already had on
his little red nose

41:13.805 --> 41:17.843
And he reached over and he
just honked me breasts.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.811
I mean, you know, I think-I
think he was just trying

41:19.845 --> 41:23.181
To break the ice but I was so
surprised that I just...

41:23.214 --> 41:27.418
Reached over and I grabbed
him by his penis really hard

41:27.452 --> 41:29.855
And I could let go.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.356
You know, and there we
both were

41:31.389 --> 41:33.258
Starring at each other.
Him...

41:33.291 --> 41:37.663
Cuppin' me jubblies and me
really givin' it to his banana.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.267
So things are better
with Mark?

41:43.735 --> 41:44.703
Oh.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.504
Mark? No.

41:46.538 --> 41:48.506
He wouldn't put me
out if I were on fire.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.543
Oh no, so you gonna
get a divorce?

41:51.577 --> 41:54.813
No. No, divorces
are horrible for children.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.347
No, we would never
put them through that.

41:56.381 --> 42:00.552
I may be a terrible wife, but
I'm a great goddamn mother.

42:00.586 --> 42:01.920
Wait. So are you, are you
seeing someone...

42:01.953 --> 42:03.121
- on the side?
- No.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.092
There are web sites.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.494
You know, for people
who just wanna...

42:09.527 --> 42:11.229
Hook-up every now
and again.

42:11.262 --> 42:14.065
You know, it's very casual.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.901
It's easy.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.069
I mean, we're all
in the same boat, right?

42:18.103 --> 42:20.405
Nobody wants to get
into a messy situation.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.107
Do you think you could
send me the link?

42:22.140 --> 42:23.274
Absolutely.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.910
Oh, great. Thanks, yeah.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.880
But aren't you just, aren't
you kind of, living a lie?

42:28.914 --> 42:30.982
Oh don't be so dramatic.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.751
I mean, we're doing it
for the kids.

42:32.784 --> 42:35.220
Mark and I may hate each
other, but we...

42:35.253 --> 42:36.287
We love the kids.

42:36.321 --> 42:37.322
We love the kids.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.424
And, I mean, we want them
to keep their lives.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.260
We don't want them
shuffling back and forth

42:42.293 --> 42:44.162
From house to house
every other weekend.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.698
I mean... no.

42:46.732 --> 42:47.733
That's not a way to live.

42:47.766 --> 42:50.936
If the, the kids are happy
then we're happy.

42:50.969 --> 42:51.970
[Baby crying]

42:52.003 --> 42:53.271
Aw, yes.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.742
But how can you possible by
happy?

42:56.775 --> 42:58.109
Listen.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.946
You have to satisfy
yourself as a parent first,

43:00.979 --> 43:04.449
Otherwise it's the kids
who really get hurt.

43:04.482 --> 43:05.951
I'm right, right?

43:10.521 --> 43:11.957
So then I just stuck
me thumb in,

43:11.990 --> 43:13.992
But you know, even that's
only so big, isn't it?

43:14.025 --> 43:17.262
Hmm. Well, how far?
Like, nail? Or...

43:17.295 --> 43:19.998
No, I mean, all the way in
because that's, you know...

43:20.031 --> 43:21.232
[Laughs]

43:21.266 --> 43:24.102
I, I heard it's like past the,
past the knuckle

43:24.135 --> 43:25.470
And it's uncomfortable,
you know.

43:25.503 --> 43:27.973
Do you always serve your,
uh, yogurt in a tube?

43:28.006 --> 43:29.540
Oh yeah, it's brilliant.

43:29.574 --> 43:32.010
Cause, it's yogurt, right? But
then...

43:32.043 --> 43:33.344
You know, it's in a tube.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.146
Yeah, but it's not really
yogurt.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.547
I mean, have you
read the ingredients?

43:36.581 --> 43:38.349
It's got five different
sweeteners in here.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.951
Oh, yes.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.487
That's right, I forgot.
You're Larissa's brother.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.124
Oh, does Larissa not let you
eat things from a tube?

43:46.157 --> 43:47.659
No, it's...

43:47.693 --> 43:50.195
It's the high fructose corn
syrup... that's, uh...

43:50.228 --> 43:51.562
It's like crack for kids, right?

43:52.497 --> 43:54.933
Right well we won't have
anything in a tube

43:54.966 --> 43:56.067
For next week.

43:56.101 --> 43:58.203
Is that all right?
All forgiven, Daddy?

43:58.236 --> 44:00.271
That's... um...

44:00.305 --> 44:03.875
You know... you know, just
don't call me Daddy it's...

44:03.909 --> 44:04.976
Sorry.

44:06.377 --> 44:07.846
That's okay.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.115
You know, he's single.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.449
Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.851
Yeah, he's nice.

44:12.884 --> 44:14.085
Yeah. Yeah.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.287
I'm not, not really looking for
anything nice at the minute,

44:16.321 --> 44:18.957
You know, just strictly
looking for sexual deviants.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.291
Right now...

44:20.325 --> 44:21.492
Oh.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.328
Well. Good luck then.

44:23.361 --> 44:25.030
Oh, thanks. Yeah, thanks.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.899
[Nervous laughter]

44:27.933 --> 44:28.767
Okay.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.835
Can I have my cup back?

44:29.868 --> 44:31.636
- Right, sorry.
- Yeah.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.805
So now I want it to be
honest, right?

44:33.839 --> 44:37.508
But not necessarily
completely truthful.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.277
All right, well...
how's this then?

44:39.310 --> 44:41.913
"Bitter, unsuccessful
middle aged loser"

44:41.947 --> 44:44.482
Wallowing in
an unending sea of inert,

hanger-oners

44:48.153 --> 44:51.289
To abuse with dull stories,
kinky sex

44:54.325 --> 44:55.660
Do you think I should
mention

44:55.693 --> 44:57.729
That I've got a child?

44:57.763 --> 44:58.997
"With a bastard."

44:59.030 --> 45:01.199
God, why don't you just say
I masturbate every night

45:01.232 --> 45:02.200
And cry myself to sleep?

45:02.233 --> 45:03.201
- Give me that.
- Hey!

45:03.234 --> 45:04.770
One more go.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.571
Um... oh!

45:06.604 --> 45:08.840
"I'm A Little Red Hen

45:08.874 --> 45:11.309
And the barnyard feels
empty without you."

45:11.342 --> 45:13.078
Oh yeah, I like that.

45:13.111 --> 45:14.545
Add... okay.

45:14.579 --> 45:17.816
Add "I would like to have my
feathers tickled by you..."

45:17.849 --> 45:19.684
Those into henpecking
need not apply.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.019
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!"

45:21.719 --> 45:23.054
I'm not writing that last part.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.122
Oh no, it's great, right?

45:24.155 --> 45:26.324
Cause it's a bit risqué, you
know, I say...

45:26.357 --> 45:27.859
I say the word "cock."

45:27.893 --> 45:32.898
Where you going?

45:32.931 --> 45:34.866
No, I say cock.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.235
It's nice, isn't it? If I...

45:41.940 --> 45:45.076
[Breathing heavily]

45:45.110 --> 45:46.544
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi, sweetie!

45:46.577 --> 45:48.513
[Stammering]
I was just upstairs
on the internet

45:48.546 --> 45:51.649
Watching some porn... uh,
some stuff, you know,

45:51.682 --> 45:54.119
On the internet uh, um.

45:54.152 --> 45:56.621
The stamina of some
of these performers

45:56.654 --> 45:59.457
Is just phenomenal.

45:59.490 --> 46:02.127
They must be on
quite the training schedule.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.429
You know, so I made
a bunch of notes.

46:04.462 --> 46:05.763
You know, things that
I thought could help us

46:05.797 --> 46:07.899
To improve our, you know...

46:07.933 --> 46:11.269
How thoughtful of you,
Horton.

46:11.302 --> 46:13.138
For example, um...

46:13.171 --> 46:15.273
Where, where, where is it.
Oh yeah, here. Uh...

46:15.306 --> 46:18.443
Did you know that every
single video starts

46:18.476 --> 46:19.845
With oral sex.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.212
Really...

46:21.246 --> 46:22.780
Why do you think that is?

46:22.814 --> 46:24.415
Well, because for a woman...

46:24.449 --> 46:28.253
Well, it's because "blow jobs
are like flowers for guys."

46:28.286 --> 46:30.155
I haven't had flowers since
our wedding.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.157
Yeah, well,
at least you got flowers.

46:32.190 --> 46:33.291
I know.

46:34.525 --> 46:38.096
We could, um, bring a toy
into the bedroom.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.932
[Stammering]
Where would we get them?

46:40.966 --> 46:44.002
- I, I have a few.
- A few?!

46:44.035 --> 46:45.503
Oh Horton, you'll love it.

46:45.536 --> 46:48.273
The first time I had an
orgasm with a vibrator

46:48.306 --> 46:50.942
It was like,
it was like seeing color

46:50.976 --> 46:53.144
After years of blindness.

46:53.178 --> 46:56.814
I'm also... um,
I'm curious about this

46:56.848 --> 46:58.917
Whole anal sex thing,
what do you think?

47:00.986 --> 47:03.554
[Laughs]

57:04.388 --> 57:06.023
Oh God.

57:06.056 --> 57:06.857
She asleep?

57:06.891 --> 57:08.125
Yep.

57:08.158 --> 57:09.694
How do you do that?

57:09.727 --> 57:12.763
Something I found on YouTube.

57:14.164 --> 57:17.067
I'm right proud of you, Pey.

57:17.101 --> 57:19.770
Yeah, well... you don't want to
know what I was searching for

57:19.804 --> 57:21.171
Before I found it.

57:21.205 --> 57:22.907
[Phone ringing]

57:22.940 --> 57:24.274
No.

57:24.308 --> 57:26.243
[Voicemail]
Hi, it's Lou.
I bought this machine used,

57:26.276 --> 57:29.246
So I don't know if it doesn't
work or if no one ever rings me.

57:29.279 --> 57:32.216
Wow. Okay.
Hopefully it's just broken.

57:32.249 --> 57:33.784
Leave a message.

57:33.818 --> 57:37.722
Hey, Lou. It's Gage,
from Mom's Group.

57:37.755 --> 57:41.125
I just, uh, just... just
give me a call when you can.

57:41.158 --> 57:47.632
Or text or e-mail or...
I don't do twitter. Um... bye.

57:50.267 --> 57:51.769
[Sighs]

58:04.815 --> 58:05.883
- What do you like?
- Everything.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.251
- Have you been tested?
- Last month.

58:07.284 --> 58:08.385
Have you ever committed
a sex crime?

58:08.418 --> 58:09.520
- Hard to say.
- Why?

58:09.554 --> 58:10.420
Lines are blurry.

58:10.454 --> 58:11.522
- Do you think you have?
- No.

58:11.556 --> 58:13.591
- Do you find me attractive?
- Love the tank-dress.

58:13.624 --> 58:15.793
- Did you bring handcuffs?
- That a deal breaker?

58:15.826 --> 58:17.127
No, got my brother's.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.529
Okay. Mmm.

58:18.563 --> 58:20.297
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.599
Talk dirty to me.

58:21.632 --> 58:22.933
All right. Um.

58:22.967 --> 58:25.269
I'm gonna bang you batty.

58:25.302 --> 58:29.173
I'm going to wrap myself around
your mildewy meat stick!

58:29.206 --> 58:30.374
Mildewy?

58:30.407 --> 58:31.742
Oh, Sorry. I've not,
I've not really done this.

58:31.776 --> 58:32.710
What should I say?

58:32.743 --> 58:34.679
Just tell me you want
my gigantic cock.

58:34.712 --> 58:35.813
Oh, I do.
That's what I want!

58:35.846 --> 58:40.184
I want, I do want that.
I want, I want your gigantic...

58:40.217 --> 58:42.219
It's not really gigantic,
though. Is it?

58:42.252 --> 58:43.387
What do you think we should call
that?

58:43.420 --> 58:44.755
Is this what you're going to be
like this whole time?

58:44.789 --> 58:47.858
No. No, no, no.
Okay. Okay. Here we go. Right.

58:47.892 --> 58:52.697
I want your gigantic cock inside
of my really gaping vagina.

58:52.730 --> 58:54.932
Gaping?

58:54.965 --> 58:57.301
It's not gaping. It's normal.
It's a really normal vagina.

58:57.334 --> 58:59.036
- I just, I thought we were...
- Maybe you should not talk.

58:59.069 --> 59:00.270
- Okay. I can not talk.
- Okay.

59:00.304 --> 59:02.072
Okay.

59:02.106 --> 59:04.008
Are, are you gonna urinate on
me, do you think?

59:04.041 --> 59:05.009
What?

59:05.042 --> 59:06.176
Well, it's okay if you are.

59:06.210 --> 59:07.712
It's just that I have
a little drop sheet.

59:07.745 --> 59:09.246
And you can just
scoot it under me

59:09.279 --> 59:11.115
And then we don't have to get
urine all over the bed.

59:11.148 --> 59:12.617
It's just... my bed.

59:12.650 --> 59:15.019
Is just... that something
you are into?

59:15.052 --> 59:15.786
I don't know.

59:15.820 --> 59:18.022
[Stutters]
Do you have to go?

59:18.055 --> 59:19.289
No.

59:19.323 --> 59:21.592
Okay, so it doesn't matter. It's
a completely moot point, innit?

59:21.626 --> 59:23.093
Just, just have your way
with me.

59:23.127 --> 59:25.429
I feel like we kind of lost
momentum here.

59:25.462 --> 59:26.764
Oh, no no.
We didn't. We didn't.

59:26.797 --> 59:29.099
I remember where we left off.
Watch!

59:29.133 --> 59:32.436
I want your gigantic cock
inside of my very normal,

59:32.469 --> 59:34.304
Average,
run-of-the-mill vagina.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.107
I'm gonna go.

59:37.141 --> 59:39.043
Oh, no, no, no. Don't.
No. Wait, wait, wait.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.244
I can do better!

59:40.277 --> 59:42.179
I can! I can do accents!

59:42.212 --> 59:46.851
Put your crazy big penis
inside my vagina.

59:46.884 --> 59:47.918
Wow...

59:47.952 --> 59:51.021
Okay, wait. No no no.
Hang on. Hang on.

59:51.055 --> 59:53.758
I, I... we can role play. Do you
have any fantasies or anything?

59:53.791 --> 59:56.093
I do a very convincing
Margaret Atwood.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:02.399
I'm Margaret Atwood. I write for
Canada.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.336
Novels. I'm a novel writer.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.107
It's not even close.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.282
Pey?

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.018
Peyton?

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.320
Are you out there?

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:30.060
Harder...

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:33.130
Harder...

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:36.734
Harder!

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.371
Well, I think it's safe to say

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:43.307
You're not very good at the
whole deviant thing.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:47.244
I tried really hard, Pey.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.713
Oh, I know you did, love.
But...

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:51.115
Surely you know some kind of
normal chap

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:56.653
That doesn't mind having a laugh
and not taking it too seriously.

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.088
Well, there is this bloke
in me Mom and Tots group,

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.390
Left me a voicemail.
I mean, I could give him a go.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:01.391
Well, there you have it.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:02.559
I mean, he sounds like
a bit of a wanker.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:03.961
But yeah, sure.
Start with him.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.798
I really did try hard.

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:08.933
I know you did.

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:09.900
[Baby crying]

01:01:09.934 --> 01:01:11.601
Oh, shh.
You're all right, sweetie.

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:13.103
She's got a dirty diaper.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.638
No, no. She's hungry.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.941
No, no, no. She's making
the "heh" sound.

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:18.275
Means she's uncomfortable.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.911
If she was making
the "neh" sound - hunger.

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:22.847
It's a sucking reflex.
Hits the roof of your mouth.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.215
Oh, how do you know that?

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.717
Oh, I saw it on an Oprah rerun.

01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.018
You watch Oprah?

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:30.087
Hey, what I do during her nap
time's my business.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.388
Don't judge me.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.291
Shitty diaper.
Told ya.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.061
I really like Oprah.

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:44.969
[Laughing]
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:47.104
This is one seriously
bouncy baby.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.572
Hello. How are you?

01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:49.774
Do I get... can I get a little...

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:53.410
[Stammering]
Coming in for... Okay.
Hmm? Huh? Hmm? Huh?

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.845
Okay, never mind.

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:56.713
Oh!

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:57.714
Ooh.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.616
I like a little kitchen action
here, gorgeous.

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.385
Hi. Hi.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.253
Mmm carroty.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:04.254
I have a plan.

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:05.355
Okay.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.423
We're going to have sex.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:07.591
Hmm?

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:08.793
- With that?
- Sound good?

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:10.594
Oh my God. I like this plan.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:13.230
Oh, easy. I need
some me time first.

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:16.100
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.534
Okay, so you watch Annie.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.237
If you could finish the dishes
and do the laundry

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.439
And then we'll have a go.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:25.175
Oh, if you could switch the
sheets on the upstairs bed,

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.177
That would be fantastic,
actually.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.445
How about forget it?

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.679
What?

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:31.015
This is ridiculous.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:33.417
What? Well, all those things
need to get done.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.386
Yeah, and I'll do them because
I am a member of this family

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.754
And it's my responsibility.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:39.423
Not because you're dangling sex
in front of me

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:40.624
Like I'm a frat boy.

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:41.959
I thought you'd like this idea.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:45.295
No! I don't, I don't want
thanks-for-changing-
the-sheets sex.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.131
I want to be Goddamn romanced.

01:02:47.164 --> 01:02:48.799
I don't want to feel
like I had to earn it.

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:51.301
Okay, well, well.
I need to feel relaxed

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:53.770
And knowing that those things
are getting done

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:55.305
Makes me feel relaxed

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:57.374
Well, you know what relaxes me?

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:59.443
Being intimate with my wife.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:04.114
That bond, okay. And it's
been a year and I miss it.

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.215
Is that why you paid
a professional

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:06.450
To tell me
to have sex with you

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.118
For a hundred days in a row?

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:13.390
I have been reading
online... okay?

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:17.127
When you breastfeed Annie,
it releases a hormone
called oxytocin,

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.964
It's basically a love hormone,
so you get to feel connected

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.731
To something during that time,
okay?

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:22.766
It's basically, it's like,

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.102
As if you were jerking off all
the time.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.570
Okay? So I get it.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:28.772
I get it why you don't need this
as much as I need it.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.107
But I need it.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.241
Babes...

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:32.776
You know, you know what?
It's me time. Go have me time.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.046
And I will attend
to the never ending cascade
of laundry in this house.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.581
Three people live here.

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.549
Can you explain how we have so
much laundry?

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:40.918
Is Annie running a speak-easy?

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.219
And just other babies
come to town

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:43.954
And they just lose their shirts
playing poker?

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:47.591
Is... are we living on top of an
ancient laundromat burial
ground?

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.592
Could that be it?

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.202
Ooh. Shit.

01:03:58.235 --> 01:03:59.269
Ahh.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:07.978
Hello lover.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.116
You look fantastic.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:13.850
Thank you!

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:17.021
So... how do we start?

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:18.722
Well, I thought we could
take some cues

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.457
From some of those videos
that you watched?

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.892
Does that mean I get a blow job?

01:04:21.926 --> 01:04:23.894
Sex etiquette. Ladies always
come first. Move.

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:32.336
Okay.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.805
It's time for a little
yoddle oddle oddle oddle ooh.

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:39.576
And, surprise...

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:46.383
Uh... hon?

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:47.751
What, what's going on
down there?

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:49.853
It's called a landing strip.
Do you like it?

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.255
It, yeah, it's lovely.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.357
I had it done in town.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.592
Wh... what if we run into that
person at the market?

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.027
Horton...

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.695
I don't want everybody in town
talking about my wife's landing
strip.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.896
Horton, you're over-thinking
this. Come on.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.165
Let's get started.

01:05:01.966 --> 01:05:03.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:04.734
What if the kids
find out about...

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:07.404
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
What is the matter with you?

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:10.040
You have an eager, willing,
and if I may say so,

01:05:10.074 --> 01:05:12.809
Very sexy older woman
lusting after you

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:16.413
And hoping that you shower her
with all your wildest desires,
honey.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.183
- I'm in.
- Ah, good!

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.150
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.354
[Moaning, giggling]

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:25.455
That tickles!

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:27.424
Ooh! Oh wow wow
wow wow wow!

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.194
Uh oh! Uh oh.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.628
What? What what what?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.398
My contact lens. Oh, it it.
Don't, don't move

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.966
- Where is it?
- Just hold on for a minute.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.901
I can find it.
Okay, there, ah!

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.303
- Ahh!
- What?

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:40.637
Ohh. Ohh.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.239
Where... I can't see
a damn thing.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.574
- A flashlight here
- Stay there. Stay there.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:45.809
- Oh, it's over here.
- More to the left.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:48.278
- Ooh. Oh honey.
- Wait, it keeps moving around.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.679
I got, I got,
I think I got it.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:51.081
Oh yeah. Yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah.

01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:52.349
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah yeah yeah. You're there.

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:53.417
- I got... yes!
- You're almost there.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.185
- I got, I think I...
- Whoa!

01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:58.788
Oh, I like where you're going
with that, Horton!

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:01.291
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:03.960
Don't stop! Oh, don't stop!
I'm almost there!

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:05.595
Oh, for crying out loud!

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:08.298
Do you realize
how stupid we look?

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:11.601
I mean, grandfathers don't go
poking around for contact lenses

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.403
In grandmother's openings.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:16.573
That's how you see me?
As a grandmother?

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.542
I am a sexual being, Horton.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.610
You're a sexual being
with varicose veins.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:23.613
And you have 50 extra pounds
that you're never gonna lose,

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.015
But I still desire you.

01:06:25.049 --> 01:06:26.883
You're the one who came to me
complaining about

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.618
Our lack of sex.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.620
I know. And I should have left
just well enough alone.

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:32.056
But you didn't.

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:36.360
You opened Dolores' Box
and I'm glad.

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:39.429
I love you, Horton,
and I still have my needs.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.766
The kids are gone and if I do
one more fucking puzzle...

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.168
I'm gonna kill somebody.

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:49.406
Horton, I will not go back
to the way it was before.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.977
It's your call.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.220
Oh, God...

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:08.258
Hey, ready?

01:07:08.292 --> 01:07:09.893
For what?

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:12.762
It's date night.
The sitter's downstairs.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:15.765
Oh uh, pfft. I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:18.902
Oh...

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:22.472
Ten minutes? Or eleven?
Eleven and a half?

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:23.673
Sure.

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:26.743
Awesome.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:44.928
Um... oh!

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:47.097
Fettuccine Alfredo,
that sounds good. I'll do that.

01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:48.698
Really?

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:51.101
You're going to do
dairy and starch?

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:53.103
Um, yeah. So?

01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:56.773
It's just not the most winning
of combinations for you.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.420
You were quiet during dinner.

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:11.755
Yeah, I guess I was
just trying to enjoy

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:14.258
Every scrumptious morsel of the
meal you hand picked for me.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.592
Okay, next time I'll let you
feel bloated...

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.228
- for the whole night.
- Thank you.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.298
- When we go back you can have...
- Oh God. It's not about the
fucking pasta.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.466
It's that you don't think
I can make

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:25.301
Even the tiniest of decisions.

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:26.603
I don't think that.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.139
Okay, great. Then I get to
decide what time

01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:31.140
Our kid takes a nap,
or what snack he eats,

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:32.242
Or what show he watches.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.609
- Now, that's different.
- It isn't!

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.312
Yes, it is. I'm with him
more than you are.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.413
You never have to deal
with the fall-out from those
kinds of decisions.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.948
I work from home.
I'm there all the time.

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:42.386
And yet you never are.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:45.455
Oh. Okay. You want me to step up
and assign roles here?

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.591
- From now on, I'm the "mom".
- Why?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.892
Because I'm the one who had him.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:03.773
Wow, you look gorgeous.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:04.908
Oh, thanks.

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:07.211
Um... I, I brought red.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.278
I hope that's okay.

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:09.546
Oh, yeah! Yeah.
I mean...

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.281
I think I might be an alcoholic,
but you know.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.482
[Nervous laughter]

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:15.185
Anyway, what's one drink, right?
Come in! Come in. Come in.

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:17.953
Um, I just need a moment, so
just make yourself at home.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.622
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, sure.

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:32.368
[Whispering]
I think I'm going to bunk it up.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.438
[Whispering]
Oh, bollocks. You look great.
Just be yourself.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.939
Oh, no. I can't be myself!

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.774
Every time I'm myself,
I mess it up!

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.710
Do you have a little something?

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.178
You know,
to take the edge off, like?

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.888
All right,
just the smallest amount.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.089
- Okay.
- All right.

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.691
- What is it?
- Valium.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:57.060
Okay... where did you get it?

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.263
Oh, from a mom in the park.
It's for my back.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.597
Huh? What's wrong with your
back?

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.567
Spasms. I was fucking
this wild chick and I...

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.035
It helps me get to sleep,
all right?

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:06.970
So you just...

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:09.306
Do I drug myself
to sleep every night? Yes.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.741
We don't have to tell each other
every fucking thing, all right?

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.076
Go down there and have some fun.

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.778
- Just on the table?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:15.779
- Yeah, thanks.
- Looks delicious.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:16.746
Oh, thanks.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.249
So you like to cook?

01:10:19.283 --> 01:10:20.950
Yeah, well you know,
you learn a thing or two

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.352
When all your dates end early.

01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:23.920
- [Nervous laughter]
- Heh, you're funny.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.726
Where's your cutlery?

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.128
Um! It's in the glass.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.298
I-I mean it's here!
It's right here.

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:35.732
Oh, great.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:36.566
Oh, no no no. I can do that.
It's, it's...

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.335
I already got it.

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:42.839
Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.310
Okay! Okay.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.218
I am having a lovely time.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.253
I just want to thank you,
you know?

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.756
I-I feel really good around you.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.891
[Chuckles]

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.431
Sorry, I just snotted a little.

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:08.765
Oh, great. Yeah.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:09.966
But you know, I'm serious.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:14.538
I-I don't know what it is.
I trust you, you know?

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:16.573
Okay. Fuck it. I'm gonna go
for full disclosure here.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.543
I have... I have dated
a lot of women.

01:11:19.576 --> 01:11:20.710
That's nice, yeah.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.045
No, it doesn't.
It sucks.

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:24.314
Too many is too many.

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:27.183
I, I always find something
wrong with them,

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.718
That's the thing, you know,
and for a long time,

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:30.754
I thought it was them,
but it's not. It's me.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.356
I'm always finding something
wrong with them because

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.757
There's something wrong with me.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.859
I'm a self saboteur, you know?

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.694
I, I choose women
who are impossible.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.596
They're too young, they're too
crazy, they're too busy,

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:40.697
They don't like kids,
they don't like me,

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:41.665
Like, what the fuck?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.568
Anyway...

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:46.069
What was I talking about?
Right...

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:49.373
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:50.874
I make mistakes
all the time.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.042
I've fucked up a marriage.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.211
I'm probably fucking up my kid
right now.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.279
No, I am not.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.414
[Knocks on table]

01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:59.315
I'm not fucking up my kid.
I will not fuck up my kid.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.617
Okay.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.353
No, sorry. I usually don't
babble like this

01:12:03.387 --> 01:12:04.621
Until, like, my fourth drink.

01:12:05.389 --> 01:12:06.890
Uh...

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.124
What I wanted to say was,

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.226
When I'm with you I just... I
feel like I'm in a safe place.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.495
I think I might have
drugged you.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:14.263
[Laughs]

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:15.532
I mean, nothing really serious.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:18.402
But just sort of an
inappropriate amount of Valium.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:20.370
No, no, no.
Pl-please don't do that.

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:22.939
Please, I, I really, I really
think you should lie down.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.441
I think you're
going to pass out.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.110
Why would you drug me?

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:28.111
Well, it just
wasn't meant for you.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:29.813
It was sort of meant for me.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.416
Why would you drug you?

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.217
Well, I just thought it would
be easier, you know?

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.052
To what?

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:38.287
Tonight. You know, the whole
night would be easier.

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:40.957
I mean, I realize in retrospect
that was poorly thought through,
but I just...

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.259
Holy shit.
You're fucking serious.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.227
Yeah...

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.230
What did you give me?

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.132
Oh, no no no no no.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:50.266
Oh, please don't leave!

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.436
Stay! I'm having a really
lovely time. Please stay.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:55.271
Stay for what? What, do you got
Rohypnol pudding for dessert?

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.407
Oh, God. You know,
it was just a stupid mistake.

01:12:57.441 --> 01:13:00.444
And, and you just said
mistakes were all right!

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:01.310
I don't feel so good.

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:02.946
Okay. All right.
Why don't you sit down?

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.415
Hmm? Let's sit down, shall we?
Yeah?

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:06.816
Could I get you a drink, maybe?

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.085
I mean, not the same drink.
A completely different drink.

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:13.356
Why did you do this to me?

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.024
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.060
I'm just really lonely
and horny, you know?

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.362
I can't really believe I just
said that out loud,

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.430
But I am, you know?

01:13:20.464 --> 01:13:21.631
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:22.866
I'm not a very good mother.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.569
My kid cries herself to sleep
most nights, you know,

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:27.471
But I love her. You know,
I do love her.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:30.239
I try really hard, but it's all
shit, isn't it?

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:32.976
You know, cause you do your best
and nobody cares.

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:35.779
And I don't want some man to
just come and sweep me off my
feet, you know.

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:36.780
That's not what I'm looking for.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:38.047
And I'm not looking for someone

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.817
To just come and hop in and out
of bed with me either, you know?

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.620
I just want to know someone can
stand to be around me, you know,

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:47.957
The me that I am when I'm not
trying to be the me that I think
everyone wants me to be...

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:50.660
Do you know what I mean?

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:55.064
Fuck! Oh, come on! Wake up!

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:57.634
Okay... come on...

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:02.238
Oh, yeah. Hi, hi.
Is, is Marcy there, please?

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.908
Oh, I really do need
to speak to Marcy.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.745
Okay. Um, right.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.414
Well, my friend and I having
a little debate and, um,

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.382
I thought maybe I could
ask you that if, um,

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:16.085
If I tell you something
sort of, say, dodgy...

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.954
Do you have to call the police

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:21.691
Or do we have some sort of
doctor/patient thing on the go?

01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:23.960
Oh you do. Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:27.030
So that's what I'll tell her.
Okay. That's great. Thanks.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.032
Oh, you've been great.
Okay. Bye!

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.266
Fuck!

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.436
Oh, God.
Why do you have to be so big?

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:36.940
Harder!

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:39.776
Harder?

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:43.647
I just need you
to help me with him.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.083
I'm not sure I can be
a part of this, I'm an illegal.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.384
It's partially your fault.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.587
You're the one
who had the Valium.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.522
Are you being serious right now?

01:14:52.556 --> 01:14:53.590
Oh...

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.625
Pey, we can't
just leave him here.

01:14:55.659 --> 01:14:57.594
So, deal with it.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:59.262
But, I can't.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:00.597
Yes, you can.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:01.631
Look.

01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:03.867
You're a smart capable woman.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.569
You just do stupid things

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.036
Because you don't think
you're good enough.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.805
It's embarrassing.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:10.106
Oh, I'm embarrassing?

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:11.741
You're the one who's illegally
in the country

01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:14.744
Cause you've pissed away every
friend and penny you ever had.

01:15:14.778 --> 01:15:16.813
You're a loser too, Peyton.
We both are.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.282
Hey, don't talk to me like mom
and dad did, all right?

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:20.383
We're better than that.

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:21.450
Oh, yeah. This from a guy who
googles

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.020
How to take care of a baby on
the internet.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.622
Yeah, well at least
I'm doing something.

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.624
I mean, you can barely touch her
half the time.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.459
That's not true!

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.463
I'm just so afraid
I'll mess her up, Pey.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.933
Look. We had shitty parents.

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:38.401
They didn't give
a fuck about us.

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:39.468
So what?

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:42.071
You turned out great.

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:44.240
Don't you know that?

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:47.744
No. Nobody's ever told me that.

01:15:48.812 --> 01:15:50.313
You see, that's just it.

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:52.448
You don't have to be told
how good you are,

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:54.083
You just need to know it.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:55.384
You see that girl upstairs?

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:58.955
She doesn't know that we don't
know what the fuck we're doing.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.124
But she can have it better
than we did.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:02.491
We can do that for her.

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:06.930
And besides.
I just told you.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.143
Ohh.

01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:22.812
Lou?

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:38.928
"I'm really, really sorry
I drugged you."

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:41.765
Well, that's nice.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.924
* What do you do

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:12.228
* With a sky so blue?

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:16.700
* Fields all a green

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:23.239
* Where the stream
runs through...

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:25.909
I met someone who's really nice
at work, but...

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:32.481
* If it all flew away

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:38.154
* And the sky
turned to Grey...

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:44.193
* I'd stay

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:47.463
* How do you hold

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:52.802
* all the sun's great gold

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:56.405
* Fields all a green

01:17:56.439 --> 01:18:01.878
* Where the stream unfolds

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:08.417
* If it all flew away

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:17.293
* and the sky turned to Grey

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:22.732
* I'd stay

01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:24.768
I completely understand
why you felt

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:27.937
The daddy comments were
inappropriate... thank you.

01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:31.074
And I can categorically assure
you that it won't happen again.

01:18:31.107 --> 01:18:34.310
I think delving into it any
further would be excessive,

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.545
Though if you need anything more
from me by way of apology

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:39.248
I would be happy to proved that.

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:42.051
Pressing on, I'm delighted
that you called me

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:43.019
And that we've reconnected...

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:51.895
* If all words fell away

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:58.301
* And there was no way to say

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:04.140
* I'd stay

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:07.443
* With you

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.478
* So you'd see

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:14.884
* Oh, how strong
Oh, how true

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:16.920
[Baby crying]

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:22.491
* Is my love, love, love

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.695
* For...

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:28.564
* You...

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:29.732
Do you need some help?

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.270
I'm all right.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.073
Besides, you're busy.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.942
You're just passing through.

01:19:40.844 --> 01:19:42.879
Well...

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:44.780
What if I said I wasn't?

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.319
I need to be able to do this.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:57.526
Okay.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.928
[Baby crying]

01:19:58.962 --> 01:20:00.964
Let's have a song,
shall we?

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:07.570
[Lou humming melody]

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:22.451
Hi there, Mr. Anti-Social.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.854
Hi, kiddo.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:28.424
You didn't have any dessert.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:30.159
I'm, I wasn't hungry.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.031
So, you, you enjoying
the big city?

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:37.901
Yes. So much more my speed.

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.903
Yeah, it's pretty slow
around here, huh?

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:42.271
Well, no.
It's just an acquired taste.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.976
So are you gonna tell me what
you're all whiny about?

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.412
Everything's fine.

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:51.814
Is it, like,
a mid-life crisis thing or...

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.549
No, it's nothing like that.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:54.650
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.120
Because mom shaved her pussy.

01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:59.923
What! Is she like
showing everybody?

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:02.959
Ew, gross. No.
She didn't like show me it.

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:06.062
She just asked me where I got
mine done and so I told her.

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:09.132
[Stammering]
Okay. That's enough. I don't
need to hear any of this.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:10.066
I'm the father!

01:21:12.135 --> 01:21:14.537
I know that you're my father...

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.605
But you don't need
to be my daddy anymore.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.443
Look, like I moved out, so...

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:24.380
Don't you think that it's time
for our relationship to...

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:27.416
I don't know... mature?

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:29.986
We can talk about
grown-up stuff now.

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:33.856
Is that like, so crazy for you?
That we're grown-ups now?

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:37.560
No...

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:40.129
I remember when you guys were
little and the three of you

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:41.730
Were out playing
in the yard one day

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:43.132
And I actually asked myself,

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:46.602
"Whose kids are those?
Cause they can't be mine!"

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.338
Dad, you were the best.

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:54.210
At the time, I just thought that
I would never get used to it.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:58.847
But now... now...

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:02.585
Now I'm stuck.

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:03.619
Aw.

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:08.557
Your mother wants
to have anal sex.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.959
Oh, my God! Dad!

01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:11.227
Well, what do I do?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.595
Anal? I don't know!

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:13.596
Well, should I do it?

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:14.897
Jesus Chri... Dad, no!
I... I cannot have...

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.365
I can't have this conversation
with you. That's...

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:19.935
Sweetie, please! I need you.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:24.073
I mean, what can I do?
This is too much for me.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.776
Okay...

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:30.746
Okay, well just...

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.381
Keep an open mind...

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:33.916
So you're saying I should?

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.584
Oh, my God. I don't know!

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:37.686
I'm not like giving you
my stamp of approval, I just...

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:41.790
Um, just, you should do
what you have to do,

01:22:41.824 --> 01:22:44.627
And then we should never
talk about it ever again.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.295
Okay.

01:22:47.763 --> 01:22:49.598
Okay...

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.267
Well, should I get some
lubricant?

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.336
God, daddy. I can't.

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:09.418
Did she leave
without saying goodbye?

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:13.356
[Gasps]
Oh, God! Horton!

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.624
Why are you naked?

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.826
Because I can be.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.096
You scared the hell out of me.

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:21.464
Shut up.

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:23.699
Excuse me.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.334
Let's fuck.

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:27.270
Now?

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:29.772
Yeah. Now. Right here.

01:23:29.805 --> 01:23:32.075
On the floor.

01:23:32.108 --> 01:23:34.043
Because we can.

01:23:34.077 --> 01:23:35.944
That's our new mantra.

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:39.948
We are going to do
everything we want to do.

01:23:39.982 --> 01:23:43.786
Because we can.

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:48.291
Well, I love the sounds of that.

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:53.762
What are your thoughts
on butt plugs?

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:57.233
Um... Can we start slow?

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.268
Yes, we can.

01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:01.670
[Chuckles]

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:20.256
He's asleep?

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:21.990
Mhmm.

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:42.745
What I said the other night...

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:45.281
No, it's fine. It's true.

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:46.882
Oh, don't make me hate myself.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.251
Believe it or not,
I can't control

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:49.252
How you feel about yourself.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.026
Hit me back.

01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:00.196
No.

01:25:03.299 --> 01:25:05.634
[Sobbing]

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.607
You're his mother
just as much as I am.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.708
I'm a glorified aunt.

01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:14.743
- Oh, stop it. That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:15.944
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:21.116
Wow. Are we even now?

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.718
No. No we're not.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:23.752
Cause I can never be
what you are.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:24.620
I can never feel what you felt,

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:27.456
And I fucking resent you for it.

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.991
Do you feel better now?

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.262
You're an amazing mother.

01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:35.063
Fuck you, I'm not!

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:36.965
I'm a control freak and you know
what the worst part of it is?

01:25:36.999 --> 01:25:39.535
I feel like I have to be because
if I'm not, if I'm not
a control freak,

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:40.803
Then who the hell am I
to both of you?

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.137
And what if you realize that
you've made a mistake,

01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:44.240
What if you realize that you...

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:47.610
That you don't need me.

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.412
Oh, you don't honestly
believe that?

01:25:50.413 --> 01:25:52.715
Yeah...

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:55.284
I do, actually.

01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:59.322
You... you nurture
and, and stimulate him.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:03.058
So you couldn't carry him?

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.293
So fucking what?

01:26:04.327 --> 01:26:06.562
I mean, God, I don't know
if you remember this

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:08.564
But I was a fucking nightmare
the entire time

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:10.733
And I resented the shit out of
you because you couldn't do it.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:14.937
I'm a mom because of DNA.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:18.574
You're a mom because
that's who you are.

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:21.644
You said to me the other night

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.546
That, that I haven't
been there for him...

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:25.314
No, I'm sorry. That's not true.

01:26:25.348 --> 01:26:26.982
I know.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:33.222
It's you that I haven't been
there for.

01:26:33.256 --> 01:26:34.156
How you doing?

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:40.929
I'm great.

01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:47.736
Mommy, mommy, mommy.

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:49.605
I'm on it.

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:51.340
Mommy, where are you?

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.346
Mommy, mommy, mommy!

01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:33.816
[Dryer beeps]

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:35.784
[Dryer rumbles]

01:27:35.818 --> 01:27:36.919
Oh, yeah.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.088
Oh, yeah...

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:43.826
[Moaning]

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:50.999
[Doorbell]

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:02.244
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:04.313 --> 01:28:06.882
I'm sorry...
Oh, do we have Mom's Group?

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:11.286
No, no. I just, um,
I forgot my sippy cup last time.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.287
Oh, right.

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:13.389
Is now a bad time, or...

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:17.259
No, no. I was, um,
just getting my laundry on.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.262
[Breathes heavily]

01:28:33.275 --> 01:28:34.743
Sweet enough?

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:39.815
You never told me what you
thought about my pictures.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:43.285
Oh, you know, I think the, the
busboys might have taken them.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:44.152
I couldn't find them.

01:28:44.186 --> 01:28:45.488
No, they didn't.
They have their own.

01:28:46.522 --> 01:28:47.490
Of course they do.

01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:49.157
You look like you need a hug.

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:51.860
- No, I'm okay. That's... that...
- Just, just, just a little one.

01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:54.530
There, is that better?

01:28:57.132 --> 01:29:00.168
So how's stuff at home? Is it
just, like, crazy with the kid?

01:29:02.137 --> 01:29:05.474
Oh, yeah. Things at home
are pretty crazy, yeah.

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:07.443
Both my siblings, they have
toddlers running around

01:29:07.476 --> 01:29:11.246
And I just don't know how they
find time to fuck, you know what
I mean?

01:29:13.115 --> 01:29:15.384
Well, there's more important
things in the world...

01:29:15.418 --> 01:29:18.954
Huh uh. I am not gonna let my
kid mess with my love life.

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:22.157
That's for fuckin' sure.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.527
Yeah, well you say that now,
but you don't know.

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:28.664
No, when my kid is sucking on
their soother,

01:29:29.998 --> 01:29:30.899
I'm going to be sucking...

01:29:30.933 --> 01:29:32.134
Okay.

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:34.503
Hi.

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:37.573
This is not okay.

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:40.042
Why? Why, we're just talking?

01:29:40.075 --> 01:29:41.109
This is not talking.

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:43.746
Yes it is. It's body language.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:49.317
You smell really nice.

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:52.588
I taste nice too.

01:29:55.524 --> 01:29:58.727
It's okay.
It's okay, just relax.

01:29:58.761 --> 01:30:00.463
Just do whatever you want.

01:30:19.181 --> 01:30:21.517
[Breathing heavily]

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:25.488
What am I doing?

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:27.289
I'm not even close to my house.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.096
Hey... okay.

01:30:35.498 --> 01:30:37.600
So, let me get this straight.

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:38.701
She drugged you?

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:41.770
You know, it sounds worse
than it was.

01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:43.972
Oh, my gosh.
She knows where I live.

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:45.273
I let her around my kid!

01:30:45.307 --> 01:30:47.142
No, you can't tell her
I told you.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.411
Look, it was...
I'm sure it was an accident.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.614
What does it matter? You're not
going to see her again.

01:30:53.916 --> 01:30:56.952
Tell me you're not
going to see her again.

01:30:57.986 --> 01:30:59.922
Look, she's kind of awesome.

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.957
So she's messed up.
Who isn't, right?

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:05.661
Oh, my God. You can't possibly
be this hard up for sex.

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:07.963
No. Sex is easy. You can get it
anywhere, it's...

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:10.065
Maybe you can get it anywhere.

01:31:10.098 --> 01:31:11.433
So can you.

01:31:14.937 --> 01:31:17.239
[Baby crying on monitor]

01:31:17.272 --> 01:31:19.241
Oh, I'll be back.

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:34.790
Hey, you.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.734
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:45.768 --> 01:31:47.135
She's back down.

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:48.871
All right, good.

01:31:48.904 --> 01:31:49.638
[Dryer rumbling]

01:31:49.672 --> 01:31:51.273
What's that?

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:54.009
Oh, uh. I heard your laundry
ding, so I switched it for you.

01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:57.780
I hope that's not...

01:32:11.093 --> 01:32:12.327
Honey?

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:17.933
What's wrong?

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:20.535
We have to talk.

01:32:20.569 --> 01:32:24.272
It's much easier to fantasize
about someone

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:26.208
You're not angry with
for missing supper

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:28.210
Or leaving wet towels
on the floor.

01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:30.378
Someone who is sexually
available

01:32:30.412 --> 01:32:33.415
When your partner's not.

01:32:33.448 --> 01:32:35.651
When the excitement goes
out of your relationship,

01:32:35.684 --> 01:32:40.055
You can't help but want it back
in some form.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:45.127
You can talk it out, but
that's... that's hard work.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:50.398
You have to say, out loud,
things that are uncomfortable
and honest.

01:32:50.432 --> 01:32:53.168
It's so much easier to check out
and find something new

01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:55.003
And exciting along the way.

01:32:56.939 --> 01:33:02.310
But, the fact that
you're here is good.

01:33:02.344 --> 01:33:04.079
The fact that you're talking
is good.

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:10.085
This is a place where most
couples don't even attempt to
get to.

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:12.420
That's not something that's
going to be solved over night.

01:33:12.454 --> 01:33:15.057
This is the first step.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.693
But if you don't, if you don't
take that step...

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.630
You're not going anywhere.

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:36.745
Okay!

01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:39.181
Where'd ya' go, sexy?

01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:43.819
Right here... oh!

01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:56.264
Hi, honey.

01:33:56.298 --> 01:33:57.933
I didn't know you and
Oops would be home.

01:33:57.966 --> 01:33:58.867
Oh, fuck! I'm sorry!

01:33:58.901 --> 01:34:00.936
Well, you know what? Next
time write...

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:03.706
On the calendar
beside the fridge.

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:04.807
I am sorry. I...

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.308
And you know another thing?
Stop calling him Oops.

01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:09.144
I hate it
when you call him Oops.

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:11.246
Okay. Okay. I promise I will
never call him that again.

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:12.380
Oh, it doesn't
even matter, Sean,

01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:14.282
Because you're never gonna
see him again.

01:34:14.316 --> 01:34:16.051
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:17.085
I'm being ridiculous?

01:34:17.119 --> 01:34:18.921
- I'm being ridiculous?
- Yes.

01:34:18.954 --> 01:34:21.589
Who is the one who was having a
mid-life crisis on the same bed

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:23.491
Where his son was conceived?

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.362
This transition has been big.

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:29.464
Look at the big picture
here, right.

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:30.766
Look at it, think about it.

01:34:30.799 --> 01:34:32.801
You can't tell me that you
were over the moon

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:34.669
About everything that you
had to give up

01:34:34.703 --> 01:34:36.471
That meant something
to you because of some kid.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:39.441
He's not some kid, you prick.

01:34:39.474 --> 01:34:40.776
He's our kid.

01:34:40.809 --> 01:34:43.178
He's this little bundle
of amazingness

01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:45.313
And you don't even realize it

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:46.815
Because you can't see the
things that you have, okay?

01:34:46.849 --> 01:34:48.050
You only see the things
you used to have.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:49.284
No...

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:50.118
Well if you want
that life back,

01:34:50.152 --> 01:34:50.986
You can go ahead
and you can take it

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:51.954
Because I don't fucking,

01:34:51.987 --> 01:34:54.890
I don't-I don't want it
anymore.

01:34:54.923 --> 01:34:56.892
Oh, come on. Ms. Superior.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:59.494
You can't look me in the eye
and tell me that you don't

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.129
Realize that
every single minute

01:35:01.163 --> 01:35:02.464
That you try to
put him to sleep

01:35:02.497 --> 01:35:04.466
Is a minute you're never
going to get back again.

01:35:04.499 --> 01:35:05.801
Huh?

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:07.335
C'mon it's like
he's stealing your life away

01:35:07.369 --> 01:35:08.904
One stupid
children's story at a time.

01:35:08.937 --> 01:35:10.238
They're not stupid, Sean.

01:35:10.272 --> 01:35:11.639
What do you mean they're
not stupid?!

01:35:11.673 --> 01:35:13.175
Come on...

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.643
What kind of a brother
comes over a hill,

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:17.545
Sees a troll, and says "No,
no, don't eat me."

01:35:17.579 --> 01:35:19.982
Wait for my brother who's
coming up right behind me."

01:35:20.015 --> 01:35:21.784
What the hell kind of lesson
is that?

01:35:23.118 --> 01:35:25.854
And, and who the hell says,
what is it?

01:35:25.888 --> 01:35:27.790
"Not by the hair of my
chinny, chin-chin."

01:35:29.357 --> 01:35:30.959
What the hell is that?!

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.030
Come on.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:37.432
Honey, be honest with
yourself.

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:39.701
Deep down we both want
the same things.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.937
See, that's just it, Sean.

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:43.872
I don't think that we do.

01:35:43.906 --> 01:35:46.208
You are...

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:48.010
You're just a sad...

01:35:48.043 --> 01:35:50.278
Old man whose trying to hold
onto his youth.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.249
You're a house-wife.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:01.689
C'mon. C'mon, I'm sorry.
Please come back

01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:03.125
And we'll, we'll talk.

01:36:03.158 --> 01:36:04.292
Please?

01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:08.596
Not by the hair of my chinny-
chin chin.

01:36:20.075 --> 01:36:22.644
I know this probably makes
no difference to you,

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:25.113
But I didn't know he was
married.

01:36:31.019 --> 01:36:34.890
Do you... Do you have some
place that you could go?

01:36:34.923 --> 01:36:37.960
I mean, 'cause if you do, you
should...

01:36:39.261 --> 01:36:41.229
You should go there and
don't come back.

01:36:41.263 --> 01:36:43.298
I mean, that piece of shit
he's never going to change.

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:45.233
He... he'll say that he will.

01:36:45.267 --> 01:36:46.268
But he won't.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:47.769
I mean, he'll beg and he'll
plead

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:49.304
But you should just go and
not come back.

01:36:49.337 --> 01:36:52.607
I mean do it for...
do it for your son.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.977
Believe me...

01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:56.912
Someone who steps out on
their family

01:36:56.945 --> 01:36:59.314
Will always step out on their
family.

01:37:02.284 --> 01:37:04.887
They're just... broken.

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:13.028
You know, I would... I would
apologize for all of this,

01:37:13.061 --> 01:37:15.763
But I, I really think that I did
you a favor.

01:37:15.797 --> 01:37:17.599
I mean, now you know what
he is.

01:37:17.632 --> 01:37:19.701
And that's a good thing,
right?

01:37:20.869 --> 01:37:22.804
So...

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.139
You're welcome.

01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:27.142
Ooh!

[Clears throat]

01:37:47.062 --> 01:37:49.131
You know what? I, I'm in this

01:37:49.164 --> 01:37:50.798
Really awesome moms
group.

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:54.469
I know, I know, but it's just
that it's really nice people.

01:37:54.502 --> 01:37:58.640
Great kids. Couple of single
Dads...

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:01.176
Sorry, it's... too soon. I know.

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:03.678
Actually, it's, it's weird.

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:06.548
It's weird. I'm sorry.

01:38:08.116 --> 01:38:09.918
Taxi!

01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:13.555
You know what?
You take this one.

01:38:13.588 --> 01:38:16.124
You, you take it.

[Children squealing]

01:38:21.796 --> 01:38:24.099
- Yeah!
- Yay!

01:38:24.132 --> 01:38:25.200
What's that?

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:27.735
- Who's this here?
- Is this thing on?

01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:29.371
Oh, hi! Hi, guys!

01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:32.774
I'm sorry we missed
the party, but this, this cruise

01:38:32.807 --> 01:38:34.576
Was just too good
to pass up.

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:36.078
Happy birthday sweetie,

01:38:36.111 --> 01:38:37.445
It's grandma and grandpa,

01:38:37.479 --> 01:38:38.113
We're gonna
bring you some...

01:38:38.146 --> 01:38:40.248
Something, very special.

01:38:40.282 --> 01:38:41.616
We're going to buy you...

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:43.351
- Hi, guys!
- A buffalo!

01:38:43.385 --> 01:38:44.619
- What?
- Don't be silly.

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.621
They say they love you,
and they'll see you soon.

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:47.922
- Okay babe?
- Mama?

01:38:47.956 --> 01:38:50.592
Yeah... well, mama
couldn't make it.

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.761
Jude! Come play!

01:38:53.795 --> 01:38:55.763
- Pretty cute.
- She is cute.

01:38:55.797 --> 01:38:56.731
I think I'm gonna take

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.833
To a movie after this.

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:02.637
What do you think?

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:05.373
I think we need to hear more
about that movie.

01:39:05.407 --> 01:39:06.808
Do you want to go to a
movie?

01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:08.043
Yeah!

Yeah!

01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:17.219
D'you have something I
could slip into your drink?

01:39:17.252 --> 01:39:18.786
Oh God that's completely
inappropriate.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:20.922
I'm really sorry I-I-I...

01:39:24.259 --> 01:39:26.328
I was surprised
to get your invitation.

01:39:26.361 --> 01:39:28.163
I didn't know
if you'd come or not.

01:39:28.196 --> 01:39:30.298
I'd be crazy not to come,
you're so nice.

01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:32.367
You? Crazy? Come on.

01:39:33.501 --> 01:39:35.470
I guess I am a bit crazy,
aren't I?

01:39:35.503 --> 01:39:37.105
No.

01:39:37.139 --> 01:39:40.042
You're just dealing, just like
everybody else here.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.816
Look, I, I have these tickets
to this thing next week.

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:51.319
I thought maybe we could
give this another shot.

01:39:51.353 --> 01:39:52.987
Maybe brother could watch
the kids, what do you think?

01:39:53.021 --> 01:39:56.591
Yeah! God, he'd love to.
Oh, he's brilliant.

01:39:56.624 --> 01:39:58.293
I mean, you know, he's a
recovering drug addict,

01:39:58.326 --> 01:39:59.294
But I mean, he's great,

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.029
You know, cause he's got
like, he's got puppets,

01:40:01.063 --> 01:40:03.198
He does puppet shows
and got little trains.

01:40:03.231 --> 01:40:04.032
He does all these kinds
of things, he's great with...

01:40:14.676 --> 01:40:15.910
What was that for?

01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:18.346
I just think you're great.

01:40:20.582 --> 01:40:22.150
Even when I babble like an
idiot?

01:40:28.323 --> 01:40:29.624
What!

01:40:29.657 --> 01:40:30.625
Oh, those are the lesbians.

01:40:30.658 --> 01:40:32.560
That's Gage's sister
and her partner.

01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:36.464
Rumor has it, Gage donated
the baby juice.

- What?
- Yeah!

01:40:39.434 --> 01:40:40.502
Anyway...

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:41.836
They left the group

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.571
Over some bullshit snack
selection thing,

01:40:43.605 --> 01:40:44.639
But they're back now.

01:40:44.672 --> 01:40:45.540
Yeah, no, no...
Yeah, we've met.

01:40:45.573 --> 01:40:47.075
Oh, good!

01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:49.010
Uh, excuse me, uh,
I found this little fella

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.713
Pulling on everyone's pants
asking for Mommy.

01:40:51.746 --> 01:40:53.415
Oh, and so what,
you assume

01:40:53.448 --> 01:40:56.017
Because he's black
that he's mine?

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:57.552
Yes. That is exactly
what I assumed.

01:40:57.585 --> 01:40:59.053
Reverse-racism is fun.

01:40:59.087 --> 01:41:00.155
No, I'm, I'm kidding.

01:41:00.188 --> 01:41:01.156
Of course he's my kid.

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:02.324
Have you seen his face?
Have you seen my face?

01:41:02.357 --> 01:41:03.925
Thank you.

01:41:03.958 --> 01:41:05.760
Hey. Fun fact.

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:08.263
Did you know that toddlers
require their Mom's attention

01:41:08.296 --> 01:41:10.332
Once every four minutes?
That's 210 times a day.

01:41:10.365 --> 01:41:11.499
Must be maddening.

01:41:11.533 --> 01:41:12.734
Really?

01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:15.270
That is weird.
How did you know that?

01:41:15.303 --> 01:41:17.239
Uhh, I'm a nanny.

01:41:18.373 --> 01:41:19.574
Get out of here.

01:41:19.607 --> 01:41:20.575
That's actually really cool.

01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:23.578
Yeah. I suppose it is.

01:41:23.611 --> 01:41:28.950
So, um... do you have any
advice for a... single mom?

01:41:28.983 --> 01:41:30.952
Why don't you sit
and join us?

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:34.356
Okay.

01:41:34.389 --> 01:41:35.790
Is that baby alive?

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:37.592
Yeah.

01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:39.194
- She's a good sleeper.
- She's a good sleeper?

01:41:39.227 --> 01:41:40.595
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:41:40.628 --> 01:41:42.397
Hey, I've been meaning to
call you.

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:45.300
I wanted to say thank you,
for the other day.

01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:46.768
Don't mention it.

01:41:46.801 --> 01:41:48.803
I wanted, I wanted to thank
you for...

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.205
For not letting me
do something

01:41:50.238 --> 01:41:51.206
That I would have regret...

01:41:51.239 --> 01:41:52.607
Shh!

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.775
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:54.976
Okay.

01:41:56.811 --> 01:41:59.947
So, how long do you think
before they cut the cake?

01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:02.150
I don't know. Soon.

01:42:02.184 --> 01:42:05.453
Between seven,
20 minutes-ish?

01:42:05.487 --> 01:42:07.389
Sure. We can do that.

01:42:07.422 --> 01:42:09.191
Yeah! Okay.

01:42:13.195 --> 01:42:14.829
And don't get me
started on tank tops.

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.331
I mean, seriously, what are
you, on a yachting team?

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:18.433
Wear a shirt. Stupid.

01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:21.503
Do you mind?

01:42:21.536 --> 01:42:23.271
Hey baby.

01:42:25.207 --> 01:42:26.974
What're you doing,
I was drinking that.

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:29.076
Oh. Excuse me.

01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.112
Oh, careful,
there's a stick there.

01:42:34.282 --> 01:42:36.017
So to answer your question,

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:39.020
I think that having kids is
absolutely detrimental

01:42:39.053 --> 01:42:42.257
To the sex life of a couple.

01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:45.760
But the experience of going
through pregnancy,

01:42:45.793 --> 01:42:50.198
Childbirth, and later child-
rearing with someone else

01:42:50.232 --> 01:42:54.269
Allows for a whole new level
of trust and familiarity

01:42:54.302 --> 01:42:57.539
That I just don't think
happens otherwise.

01:42:57.572 --> 01:42:58.840
You sure about this,
out in public,

01:42:58.873 --> 01:43:00.442
People might see us...

01:43:00.475 --> 01:43:01.476
I hope so.

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:03.211
I just washed this dress.

01:43:03.245 --> 01:43:06.648
My goodness, to what do we
owe this new frontier spirit?

01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:08.450
Well, I just woke up this
morning and thought

01:43:08.483 --> 01:43:12.320
"I'm going to have sex
with my husband in a bush."

01:43:12.354 --> 01:43:16.491
So perhaps
sex after kids suffers,

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:20.862
But maybe something better
comes out of it...

01:43:20.895 --> 01:43:21.729
