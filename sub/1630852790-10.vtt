00:44.720 --> 00:47.160
Yes, you are right.

00:49.330 --> 00:50.460
I am Cha Yeong Min.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.470
What? My quick confession gave you a panic attack?

00:55.470 --> 00:56.740
You got mad

00:56.740 --> 00:58.440
so you treated the patient's life

00:58.440 --> 00:59.840
as a joke in my operating room?

01:01.110 --> 01:02.540
You think the patients' lives

01:02.540 --> 01:04.739
are a worthless joke, don't you?

01:04.739 --> 01:06.950
But… How did you…

01:10.680 --> 01:12.320
That's not important.

01:13.850 --> 01:14.950
So,

01:14.950 --> 01:16.990
you know my secret now. What are you gonna do?

01:16.990 --> 01:18.820
You can go ahead and tell people.

01:18.820 --> 01:22.090
Make me a ghost and make yourself a psycho.

01:23.230 --> 01:25.360
I'm a ghost anyway. I don't care.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.670
But what would happen to a psycho?

01:29.130 --> 01:31.370
You are already in trouble, aren't you?

01:31.370 --> 01:33.000

You do like it, don't you?

01:34.340 --> 01:36.210
I see that you talk about it with Jang Min Ho all the time.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.780
I'm not a psycho, you know?

01:39.780 --> 01:41.910
Professor Cha is very precious to our hospital.

01:41.910 --> 01:43.650
He's the expert who can make money for me.

01:43.650 --> 01:44.880
Why would I do that?

01:44.880 --> 01:48.520
Then think about it again

01:48.520 --> 01:49.789

01:54.789 --> 01:56.630
You said that you weren't a psycho,

02:00.330 --> 02:02.030
and that I was precious to this hospital, didn't you?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.240
Since you know that,

02:09.210 --> 02:11.440
you'd better leave me alone.

You still need me to make money for you when I wake up, right?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.860
I wasn't going to, but my anger got the best of me

03:05.860 --> 03:07.430
and I couldn't help…

03:07.430 --> 03:09.700
Although, it seemed he asked because he already knew something.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.840
I guess I was exposed after all.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.310
Even so, you should've denied it!

03:13.310 --> 03:14.540
How could you be so naive?

03:14.540 --> 03:15.710
Don't you have any control over your anger?

03:15.710 --> 03:16.810
What the heck were you thinking?

03:16.810 --> 03:18.180
It was their fault…

03:19.280 --> 03:22.210
They used Dr. Jang to lure me out.

03:22.850 --> 03:23.880
So what should we do now?

03:23.880 --> 03:25.780
Shall I take my words back and tell them I was lying?

03:25.780 --> 03:27.190
What kind of nonsense is that?

03:27.190 --> 03:29.120
Hey! I'm sorry.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.760
But I did try my best to be cool.

03:32.660 --> 03:33.290
So…

what do you think he'll do next?

03:35.530 --> 03:36.730
Well…

03:36.730 --> 03:39.360
Even though he's Han Seung Won, he must've been startled.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.500
Assuming he's still human.

03:41.470 --> 03:43.500
He even knows about the conversation I had with Jang Min Ho!

03:43.500 --> 03:45.540
There were only the two of us at that time.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.210
But Cha Yeong Min was there too and he heard everything.

03:47.210 --> 03:49.210
He was watching us.

03:50.710 --> 03:53.410
He really said that?

He admitted that he's Cha Yeong Min?

03:56.010 --> 03:57.650
Are you kidding?

03:57.650 --> 03:59.180
How many times do I have to tell you?

You betrayed him and stabbed him in the back.

How could an unconscious person…

Don't be stressed over that anymore.

05:52.230 --> 05:53.630
in the hospital when you were little.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.830
So, he knows.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.570
That's why he found out.

05:58.570 --> 06:01.670
And he believes what you told him.

Is that also privacy?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.520
I was quite timid when I was little.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.590
I was timid

06:20.960 --> 06:22.390
because I was only eight years old.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.100
I had an accident and I almost died.

06:27.870 --> 06:30.440
And ever since I woke up, I've been able to see things that others can't.

06:31.170 --> 06:34.510
It took me a long time to realize that they were ghosts.

06:34.510 --> 06:40.810
It really scared me, so I came to the hospital more often

06:46.890 --> 06:49.620
to see if I could keep seeing them.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.870
I wished I couldn't.

07:09.410 --> 07:11.080
And I'd run away when I saw them.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.650
But how am I supposed to live if it goes on like that?

07:16.150 --> 07:17.420

07:20.890 --> 07:23.920
Young as I was, I had all kinds of thoughts.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.830
And later, I came here to overcome my fear

07:55.390 --> 07:57.820
because I wanted to live.

I also wanted to practice how to pretend not to see them.

29:23.770 --> 29:27.380
I couldn't do too strenuous activities yet.

29:27.810 --> 29:30.350
So I'll sit here and present the song.

29:30.350 --> 29:31.720
I hope you can understand.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.250
OK.

29:46.630 --> 29:49.370
♫ I wake up in the morning ♫

29:49.370 --> 29:52.240
♫ Can hardly open my eyes ♫

29:52.240 --> 29:55.510
♫ With so many eye crusts ♫

29:58.140 --> 30:01.140
♫ Because I cried so hard ♫

30:01.140 --> 30:04.080
♫ My face looks swollen ♫

30:04.080 --> 30:07.480
♫ How to put on make-up ♫

30:08.450 --> 30:12.160
♫ The make-up base is hard to apply ♫

30:12.160 --> 30:14.360
♫ Just like you are hard to convince ♫

30:14.360 --> 30:17.630
♫ The eyelines on my swollen eyes ♫

30:17.630 --> 30:20.000
♫ Are hard to paint So is our future ♫

30:20.000 --> 30:22.600
♫ Hello Hello Hello ♫

30:22.600 --> 30:24.100
♫ It's another new day ♫

♫ Try not to call ♫

31:11.780 --> 31:18.320
♫ Not used to the life without you yet ♫

31:19.590 --> 31:25.160
♫ Memories come round occasionally ♫

31:26.830 --> 31:32.740
♫ Remind me of the past ♫

31:33.170 --> 31:37.840
♫ But do have a good day ♫

31:37.840 --> 31:39.910
It's been a long time since I came out for a walk at night.

31:39.910 --> 31:42.680
It feels so good. The scenery on the road is beautiful, too.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.680
Working in Thoracic Surgery Department must be tiring, right?

31:46.180 --> 31:47.580
I've seen it when I was an intern.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.820
It feels like you live in the hospital every day.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.450
That's how we came through.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.530
That's how we came through.

31:57.230 --> 32:00.200
But today's young people are all going to less tiring departments.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.270
May I ask why did you choose to work in the Thoracic Surgery Department?

32:03.770 --> 32:05.870
I had a deal with a girl

32:07.040 --> 32:09.810
I work in the Thoracic Surgery Department, and she works in the Neurosurgery Department.

32:19.350 --> 32:22.020
Yeong Min, we must do this in the future.

32:22.020 --> 32:23.990
We do this and make a hospital home.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.820
You work in the Thoracic Surgery Department, and I work in the Neurosurgery Department.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.460
How about it? Does it feel good?

32:27.820 --> 32:32.600
To make a hospital home must feel good...

32:41.300 --> 32:43.040
Well... How about having supper?

32:43.270 --> 32:46.440
No, let's get back to the hospital.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.180
Now that we're out, we should have a meal.

32:48.180 --> 32:50.580
It doesn't matter, I'm not hungry.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.920
Then how about we have something other than supper?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.450
Why didn't this guy pick up?

32:56.450 --> 32:59.320
He wasn't seen all day. I'm really worried about him.

32:59.420 --> 33:01.520
[Emergency Department  Park]

33:18.910 --> 33:20.240
Why did they get off the car together?

33:23.780 --> 33:25.480
And what's that look on him?

33:43.070 --> 33:44.170
Thank you for today.

33:44.170 --> 33:45.700
I could go out for a ride for your sake.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.370
Yes, me too.

33:48.140 --> 33:49.040
Then I...

34:09.330 --> 34:11.290
It seems to be a good end.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.760
Well, how about your happy hormones?

34:13.760 --> 34:16.330
Thanks to you, I've got a lot of it.

34:16.330 --> 34:18.639
I've been doing a lot of things that I would never do in my life lately,

34:18.739 --> 34:19.699
which is meaningful...

34:20.469 --> 34:21.400
What is this?

34:21.600 --> 34:23.610
You said it yourself, walnut biscuits are the next.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.110
When are you going to fulfill my request?

34:25.510 --> 34:27.340
Your request.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.310
Then how about the next one. I want walnut biscuits.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.850
OK, well, walnut biscuits are the next...

34:34.620 --> 34:36.050
At that time, it was only in a confusing state that I agreed...

34:36.190 --> 34:38.250
Even if you were confusing, a promise is a promise.

34:38.389 --> 34:40.219
I took care of it for you.

34:40.790 --> 34:42.960
What? You want me to thank you? You used my body anyway.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.699
Yes, brother.

34:49.929 --> 34:51.270
Hey, Seung Tak, something big happened.

34:51.469 --> 34:52.699
Something big? What big thing?

34:53.400 --> 34:54.469
Is it Professor Cha...

34:54.639 --> 34:55.670
Seung Jo disappeared.

34:55.810 --> 34:57.010
Where could he be?

34:57.270 --> 34:59.380
Hey, I thought it was really something big, you scared me.

34:59.610 --> 35:01.610
Maybe he is playing hide-and-seek somewhere else.

35:01.950 --> 35:03.150
Is it Seung Jo?

35:04.150 --> 35:05.780
Did you check the lounge?

35:06.150 --> 35:07.450
I'll look down stairs.

35:10.490 --> 35:12.260
Sorry. I went by myself.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.330
Next time let's go together.

35:16.090 --> 35:17.560
You and me.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.330
Oh, this.

35:24.130 --> 35:27.300
Dr. Go said you would like it.

35:32.080 --> 35:36.510
He knows you very well.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.950
Just like he is you.

35:49.330 --> 35:51.490
[ICU]

35:53.030 --> 35:54.800
Please let him become a doctor

35:55.270 --> 35:56.830
and meet patients just like himself.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.170
Yes, and work hard in the Thoracic Surgery Department.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.800
My little friend O Seung Jo,

36:04.610 --> 36:06.210
what time is it now?

36:06.510 --> 36:08.310
Don't you know that children got to bed at 9 o'clock?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.310
Let's go, I will send you back.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.480
Attending doctor.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.860
Attending doctor, are you here to see Seung Jo?

36:23.890 --> 36:25.330
Seung Jo, you…

36:34.170 --> 36:36.340
Seung Jo, Seung Jo, open your eyes.

36:54.390 --> 36:55.190
Ah.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.230
What's going on? What happened here?

36:59.530 --> 37:01.300
I came to find him and found him passed out on the ground.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.430
Did you come all by yourself? Where is Professor Cha Yeong Min?

37:06.070 --> 37:07.470
Hey, you.

37:07.640 --> 37:08.670
Find a way to save the child first.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.370
Is he around you, Professor Cha?

37:10.610 --> 37:11.870
Yes. What?

37:13.210 --> 37:14.110
He is.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.950
Replace me, hurry.

37:29.130 --> 37:30.160
Check heartbeat.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
He is back.

37:35.230 --> 37:37.470
Endotracheal intubation first, then confirm whether consciousness is restored.

37:37.970 --> 37:39.440
What? Oh.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.650
When did you... When in the world did you know it?

37:50.210 --> 37:51.280
I think it's

37:51.710 --> 37:53.020
when you knew about it.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.780
That's from the beginning?

37:55.420 --> 37:57.790
Then why did you pretend you didn't know a thing?

37:57.950 --> 38:00.960
What would you think if Professor Cha possessed me?

38:01.060 --> 38:02.430
You never asked.

38:02.690 --> 38:04.090
Why does this sound so familiar?

38:04.290 --> 38:05.600
Wow, how could you…

38:05.900 --> 38:07.600
Because you were being so obvious.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.300
Is he here?

38:11.170 --> 38:12.340
Professor Cha.

38:12.470 --> 38:13.540
Professor Cha.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.510
Hey, she can't see me, can she?

38:17.210 --> 38:21.110
Please restrain yourself, don't call me Intern O.

38:21.110 --> 38:21.980
Only you called me that.

38:22.210 --> 38:24.080
But this dude here calls me O Crystal.

38:24.550 --> 38:26.950
Well, you two couldn't even do that right.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.990
Who would call an intern that?

38:29.220 --> 38:30.320
Wow. What's wrong with her?

38:30.890 --> 38:31.690
In addition,

38:31.920 --> 38:34.920
don't do this before every operation.

38:35.020 --> 38:36.790
This seemed to be Professor Cha's signature move.

38:36.990 --> 38:38.960
Do you want to tell the world out loud that you are Cha Yeong Min?

38:39.730 --> 38:40.630
What?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.600
You've been doing this?

38:42.770 --> 38:44.000
But, that's what I do.

38:44.170 --> 38:45.700
That's hard to change. Do you understand?

38:45.840 --> 38:46.600
It's like that.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.100
It would be a miracle if nobody found out.

38:48.670 --> 38:50.870
The two of you should do that kind of things right first.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.480
We'll do what we do and I'll help you two.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.810
But why did you get all dressed up?

38:58.380 --> 39:00.450
Oh, I had a place to go.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.350
Where?

39:01.520 --> 39:02.550
Jessica's concert.

39:02.790 --> 39:03.920
What? A concert?

39:04.390 --> 39:05.250
Whom did you go with?

39:05.920 --> 39:06.760
Dr. Jang.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.060
Why did you go with her?

39:08.220 --> 39:09.690
I have my reason.

39:09.860 --> 39:11.230
But it's not the point.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.560
It looks like you've been having a good time these days.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.160
You are even dating a woman.

39:15.530 --> 39:16.400
Good for you.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
Wow, hey.

39:22.710 --> 39:24.410
Is she always so imaginative?

39:25.980 --> 39:28.040
Even if that's so obvious, should she believe it?

39:28.210 --> 39:31.110
Yeah, she is imaginative for sure.

39:31.710 --> 39:32.920
But is that really so obvious?

39:36.850 --> 39:37.690
Hey.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.230
Is it delicious?

39:48.030 --> 39:49.170
It's not?

39:49.830 --> 39:51.630
How is it not delicious? Be specific.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.740
It's all right.

39:54.770 --> 39:55.810
It's all right?

39:56.210 --> 39:57.140
Just all right?

39:57.370 --> 39:58.540
Tell me the truth, is it too sweet?

39:58.840 --> 40:00.310
The flour is too hard, too.

40:01.310 --> 40:02.080
Right.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.550
Who bought this?

40:03.980 --> 40:05.720
How was it? Is your throat okay?

40:05.880 --> 40:06.950
Were there a lot of people?

40:07.120 --> 40:08.250
Was there any customer?

40:08.520 --> 40:10.020
I don't know about the throat.

40:10.150 --> 40:13.820
There were many people on the street, but not so many customers.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.930
Right, newcomer. Do you want to try it, too?

40:21.300 --> 40:23.530
I don't eat street food.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.540
Let me be straight.

40:28.810 --> 40:30.670
Two doctors ran over

40:31.010 --> 40:32.580
and they didn't seem to have cured a single child.

40:34.810 --> 40:36.180
Now they stare people in the face.

40:36.380 --> 40:37.450
The two of them.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.690
Has it finally been found out?

40:44.990 --> 40:47.660
Oh, I was thinking you lasted a long time.

40:49.630 --> 40:50.990
Why couldn't you be more careful?

40:54.230 --> 40:55.700
You stayed in our hospital for a long time.

40:56.330 --> 40:58.270
Don't you think you should pay the rent?

40:58.770 --> 41:02.040
Wow, such a little child

41:02.240 --> 41:04.370
has grown so big.

41:05.540 --> 41:06.780
Time flies.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.210
Right. A little child has grown so big.

41:11.110 --> 41:13.150
Do you still have nowhere to go? Do you need me to help ask around?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.750
What are you talking about?

41:17.390 --> 41:20.560
You were so kind when you were a child,

41:20.860 --> 41:21.920
but now you are getting meaner and meaner.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.430
You look the same as I saw you when I was a kid.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.060
But right now you must be an old man.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.170
But why are you still here?

41:30.630 --> 41:33.340
Generally, when people die, they vanish quickly.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.340
Gee, why didn't you ask earlier?

41:36.570 --> 41:38.210
You must be curious for around 20 years.

41:39.810 --> 41:42.750
Everyone has their own story that cannot be told.

41:43.980 --> 41:46.250
No matter who it is, they have a story.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.720
When I was little, our eyes met once.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.390
You obviously saw me.

41:56.490 --> 41:58.260
But why did you pretend you didn't know?

41:58.660 --> 41:59.760
For 20 years.

42:00.530 --> 42:01.760
Well,

42:03.530 --> 42:05.130
because you pretended to not know me,

42:05.300 --> 42:06.940
then why should I show that I know you?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.340
Wow, so cool.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.110
What a nice thought.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.310
Well, I have something urgent to deal with, so let me say goodbye.

42:14.910 --> 42:16.310
Let's keep in touch.

42:20.820 --> 42:25.020
Gee, this kid has grown well.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.000
Where is Seung Jo?

42:36.670 --> 42:38.770
Well, he was taken away by the ghosts.

42:39.070 --> 42:40.440
He can't meet his mom.

42:41.770 --> 42:42.840
Did the chat go well?

42:43.270 --> 42:44.410
You can say that.

42:45.010 --> 42:46.780
Hey, I should have thought of that earlier.

42:47.580 --> 42:51.380
You came to the hospital a lot, and that guy Jeo has been here for 20 years.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.050
It'd be strange if he didn't know.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.350
Will he wake up one day?

42:57.050 --> 42:58.090
Of course

42:58.960 --> 43:00.460
I will put him into the original position.

43:01.220 --> 43:05.430
Early in the morning, Gim Jae Won will do brain CT and cardiac MRI for him.

43:05.660 --> 43:07.000
You go back and rest,

43:07.230 --> 43:08.460
I'll take care of Seung Jo.

43:17.610 --> 43:18.870
Forget about Go Seung Tak,

43:19.180 --> 43:21.180
why did Dr. Jang go to the concert too?

43:21.910 --> 43:23.410
Are people in Neurosurgery Department so laid back?

43:23.810 --> 43:25.110
Even I don't have time to go.

43:27.080 --> 43:27.920
Is it

43:28.820 --> 43:31.150
because of Professor Cha, those two started to know each other, and then...

43:31.650 --> 43:34.960
Gee, what am I talking about?

43:42.700 --> 43:43.800
Mom, I'm back.

43:44.700 --> 43:45.940
Why do you come back late every day?

43:46.070 --> 43:47.470
You should get off work on time.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.140
Well, I went out with my friends.

43:50.470 --> 43:52.270
Gee, playing is tiring.

43:53.710 --> 43:55.440
Brat, I'm back.

43:56.780 --> 43:59.120
What was that guy named it thinking? Brat?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.980
It's ridiculous.

44:01.620 --> 44:04.020
[Note: the pronunciation of “three meals” and “brat” in Korean is the same]

44:01.620 --> 44:04.020
Maybe he wanted to have three good meals a day.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.690
So it's not Brat, but Three Meals?

44:09.460 --> 44:12.290
That makes sense.

44:12.660 --> 44:14.030
But why isn't he taking it back?

44:14.230 --> 44:15.800
He asked you to take care of it for a while, but it's been a long time.

44:15.930 --> 44:17.200
It should be soon.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.570
He's busy lately.

44:23.870 --> 44:28.480
Su Jeong, mom's eyes are dry, check them for me.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.150
What?

44:29.350 --> 44:29.980
Me?

44:30.180 --> 44:31.880
You've worked as an intern in ophthalmology department for a month.

44:32.050 --> 44:33.050
Can't you do this?

44:33.950 --> 44:35.650
Oh, sure.

44:41.490 --> 44:43.530
Have you acted well in front of the professors?

44:44.890 --> 44:46.300
I heard the competition is fierce.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.500
You must be an excellent intern

44:49.070 --> 44:50.970
so as to be selected as a specialist.

44:51.270 --> 44:52.870
Don't worry. I'm trying my best.

44:56.510 --> 44:59.180
Maybe the air is too dry so that your eyes get a little dry.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.080
I know that, too.

45:02.610 --> 45:04.710
Are you an eye doctor?

45:04.980 --> 45:07.620
Of course. I'm an ophthalmology intern.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.290
Something is wrong with you.

45:10.420 --> 45:13.590
Have you rotated in the Emergency Room, Thoracic Surgery Department or Neurosurgery Department?

45:13.760 --> 45:15.930
Ow, why would I go to those torturing departments?

45:16.290 --> 45:17.730
You've promised

45:18.160 --> 45:20.800
to only be a doctor

45:20.900 --> 45:23.300
in the ophthalmology, E.N.T., or dermatology department.

45:24.070 --> 45:27.300
You are not going to live your grandpa's life.

45:29.110 --> 45:30.170
I get it.

45:31.340 --> 45:33.040
Mom, let me check for you again.

45:42.150 --> 45:43.820
Hi, did you sleep well?

45:43.990 --> 45:44.990
I slept for a while.

45:45.760 --> 45:46.720
How about Seung Jo?

45:46.860 --> 45:47.760
Still asleep.

45:48.020 --> 45:49.060
Who's his current attending doctor?

45:49.860 --> 45:50.760
Professor Gang.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.460
The reason?

45:53.130 --> 45:53.930
I found it.

45:55.770 --> 45:57.930
It's said that he often ran around recently.

45:59.870 --> 46:02.970
After the right ventricular catheter replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery,

46:03.070 --> 46:05.570
the patient's running caused his right ventricular catheter

46:05.670 --> 46:06.810
to press the internal and external arteries.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.310
The decreased blood flow in the left coronary artery led to cardiac arrest.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.820
Luckily, we found the patient in time and did a CPR

46:17.990 --> 46:19.220
to recover his heart rate.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.120
He's in coma for now.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.490
But the MRI shows no sign of cerebral injury.

46:23.630 --> 46:25.130
Observation is needed for the time being.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.800
The problem is his right ventricular catheter.

46:28.460 --> 46:29.470
Look.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
This is his cardiac CT taken this morning.

46:32.070 --> 46:34.240
The right ventricular catheter and internal and external arteries

46:34.540 --> 46:36.910
should have some spare space.

46:37.140 --> 46:39.310
But the running causes blood flow increases and the resulting blockage.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.340
Were you watching this while I was sleeping?

46:43.780 --> 46:45.080
Or what, having fun? You brat!

46:45.510 --> 46:46.550
Focus.

46:46.750 --> 46:48.020
Here comes the key point.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.350
We should create a bigger space

46:50.520 --> 46:54.820
and move the right catheter to this position.

46:55.190 --> 46:59.500
Thus, another surgery is needed to change the right ventricular catheter.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.930
Let's conduct it today, Professor Han.

47:03.470 --> 47:08.340
Uh, I'm afraid not. My schedule is full today.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.580
Oh, which professor is available today?

47:13.840 --> 47:16.710
I'll be your assistant.

47:16.850 --> 47:18.180
Do you understand what I mean?

47:19.080 --> 47:20.520
What's wrong with everybody?

47:20.880 --> 47:21.920
Chief Ban.

47:22.350 --> 47:23.650
Um, me?

47:23.890 --> 47:25.090
I…

47:25.690 --> 47:29.530
I mean, the patient is a kid.

47:29.630 --> 47:31.090
His coronary artery is in a bad situation.

47:31.260 --> 47:32.830
Multiple additional surgeries

47:33.000 --> 47:35.330
may put him in danger during the operations.

47:35.700 --> 47:38.000
Besides, the kid hasn't woken up yet.

47:38.270 --> 47:40.770
It's better to wait until he's getting better mentally.

47:40.940 --> 47:43.140
Let's observe him for a few days.

47:43.510 --> 47:44.670
Actually, according to the rules,

47:44.670 --> 47:45.810
the attending doctor should be the same.

47:46.980 --> 47:50.310
I mean, Dr. An Tae Hyeon is not here.

47:50.680 --> 47:54.380
As you know, I assisted Dr. An Tae Hyeon in the preceding surgery.

47:56.120 --> 47:58.420
Now that you mentioned it,

47:58.790 --> 48:02.390
Dr. Go, you don't need to assist me in Tuesday's operation.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.660
Oh, me either.

48:03.830 --> 48:06.100
Hwang Yeong Sik will assist me in the  coronary artery bypass graft operation next week.

48:06.260 --> 48:07.260
Yeah, and me.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.470
As for my inferior aortic aneurysm and MVR surgery,

48:10.500 --> 48:11.870
Lee Seon Ho will help me.

48:26.350 --> 48:28.450
[EunSang University Medical Center]

48:29.150 --> 48:30.590
Brother, is it you?

48:30.590 --> 48:31.850
Did you come alone

48:31.850 --> 48:34.090
or together?

48:34.090 --> 48:36.530
Well, Go Seung Tak?

48:36.530 --> 48:37.730
Cha Yeong Min?

48:37.730 --> 48:40.060
You'd better wear a name tag.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.500
Brother, are you stopping me from performing surgeries?

48:42.500 --> 48:46.100
Others may really think it's you who did it.

48:46.100 --> 48:48.000
What? Why?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.740
I'm fulfilling the duty of a vice president of administration.

48:50.740 --> 48:54.110
It's abnormal to let a resident

48:54.110 --> 48:56.110
perform surgeries.

48:56.110 --> 48:58.110
It will cause trouble if it's known by people from the outside.

48:58.110 --> 49:00.020
That's not the reason, is it?

49:00.020 --> 49:01.720
Of course not.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.890
I'm just curious.

49:03.890 --> 49:05.120
Why would Professor Cha in that state

49:05.120 --> 49:08.890
enter your body to do surgeries?

49:08.890 --> 49:13.430
I can't hear a sincere answer from him even if I ask.

49:13.430 --> 49:15.730
So I decided to stop him first

49:15.730 --> 49:17.330
and see what would happen.

49:17.330 --> 49:20.200
Though I can't kill or save Professor Cha,

49:20.200 --> 49:21.470
I can still do things of this kind.

49:21.470 --> 49:22.810
The patient is a kid.

49:22.810 --> 49:24.840
He's unconscious now.

49:24.840 --> 49:25.940
Let him have this operation.

49:25.940 --> 49:27.910
I've warned those professors.

49:27.910 --> 49:29.750
How could I do things like this?

49:29.750 --> 49:32.580
One exception will collapse power and order.

49:32.580 --> 49:33.280
Don't you know that?

49:33.280 --> 49:36.050
Is your power more important than a kid's life?

49:45.690 --> 49:49.400
The kid's life matters a lot to you, right?

49:52.070 --> 49:53.840
Now that we've said it, let's be frank.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.300
To cooperate with Professor Cha

49:55.300 --> 49:57.540
is not just good for him, is it?

49:58.440 --> 49:59.010
To be honest,

49:59.010 --> 50:01.880
you're doing it to achieve your own ambition,

50:02.680 --> 50:04.310
aren't you?

50:04.310 --> 50:06.780
I can't watch this.

50:06.780 --> 50:09.550
If you really feel sorry for that kid's life,

50:09.550 --> 50:11.990
confess your secret about Professor Cha first.

50:11.990 --> 50:17.460
Otherwise, do it yourself instead of with the help of Professor Cha.

50:19.530 --> 50:22.660
[Vice President of Administration's Office]

50:26.070 --> 50:29.040
I've warned that bastard before.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.470
But a leopard cannot change its spots.

50:30.470 --> 50:31.940
Bad people are always bad.

50:31.940 --> 50:33.640
Darn it, that jerk!

50:33.640 --> 50:34.580
Lend me your hand.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.280
I'll throw him out of the window.

50:40.150 --> 50:42.420
What's wrong? Why are you so lost?

50:43.190 --> 50:44.350
Where's Seung Jo?

50:44.350 --> 50:46.590
The crying calf

50:46.590 --> 50:51.690
sits on the pot.

50:52.230 --> 50:56.330
Mommy.

50:56.330 --> 50:57.830
My ass is so hot.

50:57.830 --> 50:59.440
Look, the kid is having a good time.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.300
Very happy.

51:01.300 --> 51:03.140
He's such a bright boy.

51:03.140 --> 51:04.110
So bright.

51:04.110 --> 51:05.810
At times like this, I always think luckily he's still a kid.

51:05.810 --> 51:07.680
Wow, he's so cute.

51:07.680 --> 51:11.010
No matter at home or in the hospital, it's always nice to have a kid around.

51:11.010 --> 51:13.120
So I plan to have more kids.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.120
A mom of many kids.

51:18.020 --> 51:20.490
But how long will he still be lucky for?

51:20.490 --> 51:22.390
I have no idea.

51:22.390 --> 51:24.760
Maybe until he realizes that the ghosts are so good.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.360
Let's play hide and seek.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.360
Okay, come on.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.160
You catch us.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.030
Hide yourself well.

51:29.030 --> 51:30.530
Okay.

51:32.300 --> 51:36.970
Hide well. Be careful of your hair.

Can't you come to pick him up quickly?

51:39.440 --> 51:40.540
What?

51:40.540 --> 51:42.850
Didn't you say that you needed a kid?

51:42.850 --> 51:45.280
And I said one more sentence.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.150
Three hours at most with a kid.

51:48.150 --> 51:51.890
You try to play hide and seek 27 times.

52:50.680 --> 52:55.820
It's just a kid's surgery. Let's work together.

52:55.820 --> 52:57.550
Dr. Go can also help.

52:57.550 --> 53:00.160
Isn't the patient still unconscious?

53:00.160 --> 53:03.160
The kid hasn't woken up. How can you perform surgery?

53:03.160 --> 53:05.730
If he still can't wake up after the surgery, then we will be in trouble.

53:05.730 --> 53:06.600
Yes, I'm aware.

53:06.600 --> 53:10.430
It's your policy to try to avoid surgeries with high risk index…

53:10.430 --> 53:13.600
No one else can do it? Then why do I pay you such a high salary?

53:14.240 --> 53:15.240
If you really have no confidence,

53:15.240 --> 53:17.270
transfer him to another hospital.

53:18.710 --> 53:20.710
That will be a little…

The full surgery cost

53:22.980 --> 53:24.880
is covered by Professor Cha's donation.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.110
And the hospitalization cost.

You said the hospitalization cost…

I see, donation.

It is for Professor Cha's operations.

53:38.690 --> 53:40.100
This additional surgery is not included.

Is there Professor Cha's signature?

53:44.100 --> 53:47.770
What signature?

53:47.770 --> 53:49.170
In the future, any use of Professor Cha's donation

53:49.170 --> 53:51.210
