<i>Previously on Witches of East End...</i>

00:02.286 --> 00:03.919
<i> I shouldn't be here.</i>

00:03.953 --> 00:05.787
<i>Killian? I figured my big brother's</i>

00:05.822 --> 00:07.222
getting married... I should
come congratulate him.

00:07.256 --> 00:09.557
<i>The girls don't know what they are.</i>

00:09.591 --> 00:10.858
I hope you choke.

00:10.892 --> 00:13.393
I made her choke, with my mind.

00:13.427 --> 00:17.128
There's something I need to tell you.
It's the truth about who we are.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.362
<i>- Please don't tell me we're witches.
- We're witches.</i>

00:18.396 --> 00:21.564
<i>You have an enemy, a shifter.
Somebody doing evil in your name.</i>

00:23.333 --> 00:26.634
<i>And they're not going to stop until you
and your girls are dead.</i>

00:26.669 --> 00:30.037
I can help you get revenge
on the witch who did this to you.

00:30.071 --> 00:33.406
<i>You stuck me in
the desert for 80 years!</i>

00:33.440 --> 00:35.074
- Somebody!
- Stop that!

00:35.108 --> 00:37.408
You have to save Freya.
He wants to kill her in the picture

00:37.443 --> 00:40.210
- because he knows if he does...
- She can't be reborn.

00:40.245 --> 00:42.311
 I know who killed my husband.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.146
<i>Joanna Beauchamp, you are under arrest</i>

00:44.181 --> 00:46.948
- for the murder of Bill Thatcher.
- You have to save your sister.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.649
I wish I could help you.

01:28.343 --> 01:29.944
Abracadabra.

01:32.112 --> 01:34.079
You're an idiot, Ingrid.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.615
It's not gonna magically open
just 'cause you say, "Open."

Okay, spell...

02:25.496 --> 02:31.868

a spell... to save Freya.

<i>To save Freya.</i>

02:33.504 --> 02:35.204
<i>You need to help me!</i>

Hey, help me. Please!
Someone's trying to kill me!

<i>Let's talk about the night
Bill Thatcher was killed. Hmm?</i>

03:05.436 --> 03:09.404
Now, I got to talk to
Maura Thatcher tonight.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.874
And she, uh...

03:11.908 --> 03:15.378
Well, she was calm, you know, lucid,

03:15.413 --> 03:20.783
<i>and very convincing.
And she claims</i>

03:20.818 --> 03:24.287
that she and her husband
were walking their dog

03:24.321 --> 03:30.226
in a park near Fair Haven
when they came across you...

03:30.260 --> 03:35.799
drawing this symbol...
in the ground.

03:39.103 --> 03:40.736
<i>You recognize that symbol?</i>

03:40.770 --> 03:43.472
Can you tell me what it means?

03:47.010 --> 03:51.313
No.
Never seen it before.

03:53.349 --> 03:57.386
She says that you were
preoccupied, agitated, angry, and

03:57.387 --> 04:01.424
that when they tried to
engage you, you attacked them.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.260
<i>She says that you killed
her husband in cold blood</i>

04:04.294 --> 04:05.761
<i>right before her eyes.</i>

04:05.795 --> 04:09.498
And her description of the attack
matches his injuries to a "T."

04:09.532 --> 04:12.768
Can I have a cigarette?

04:12.803 --> 04:17.440
- Do-do you smoke?
- Only when I'm accused of murder.

04:26.481 --> 04:30.750
<i>Resucitet incantatores.</i>

04:30.784 --> 04:33.619
Resurrection spell.

04:44.362 --> 04:48.499
Get ready, Aunt Wendy.
I'm bringing you back.

04:53.671 --> 04:57.341
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:06.385 --> 05:08.052
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

05:08.087 --> 05:10.522
- I don't know you.
- You really don't remember, do you?

05:10.556 --> 05:14.959
You have no idea what's happening.
My God, you must scared.

M-m-mysticum pictura

<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>

05:22.834 --> 05:25.369
Spiritus mundi mortuos suscitat.

05:25.404 --> 05:27.339
Spiritus mundi mortuos
suscitat. Fumus revelat veritatem.

05:27.373 --> 05:30.408
- Fumus revelat veritatem.
- Mysticum picturadevorare nos.

05:30.443 --> 05:31.710
Fumus revelat veritatem.

05:31.744 --> 05:34.546
- Spiritus mundi mortuos suscitat.
- Fumus revelat veritatem.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.080

- Fumus revelat...

- ...devorare...
- ...mortuos suscitat.

05:39.218 --> 05:42.019
- ...veritatem.
- Spiritus mundi mortuos suscitat.

05:43.755 --> 05:45.822
Hey! That's not gonna work.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.557
You trapped me in a
painting once already.

05:47.591 --> 05:50.594
Don't you think if I could have
chanted my way out, I would have?

05:50.628 --> 05:53.163
- I didn't trap you in a painting!
- Yes, you did!

05:53.198 --> 05:57.200
You kept me on the wall like a trophy!
And I was in love with you.

05:57.235 --> 06:00.737
I didn't want to hit you.
I just wanted to make you listen.

06:00.772 --> 06:02.205
I wanted to marry you.

06:02.240 --> 06:08.412
But you turned out to be
just a vindictive little witch!

06:08.446 --> 06:10.381
Just like all the rest.

06:10.415 --> 06:12.616
- Please don't stab me.
- Stab you?

06:12.651 --> 06:14.585
<i>No, I'm not going to
stab you, beautiful.</i>

06:14.620 --> 06:16.621
This knife is the only way out of here.

06:26.466 --> 06:31.104
- Oh, she's alive.
- Who's alive?

06:32.640 --> 06:36.809
Maura Thatcher.
I'm glad she's alive.

06:39.012 --> 06:42.213
I'd like to call my lawyer now.

06:42.248 --> 06:44.149
Wendy?

06:45.598 --> 06:47.145
Oh.

06:54.995 --> 06:56.529
Oh.

06:57.498 --> 07:01.100
You resurrected me?!
What were you thinking, Ingrid?

07:01.135 --> 07:03.269
I'm sorry.
I thought you would be happy.

07:03.304 --> 07:07.007
I was coming back to life
anyway. It just takes a few hours.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.608
<i>But you were dead.</i>

07:08.642 --> 07:10.743
- Like, dead.
- It doesn't work like that for me.

07:10.777 --> 07:12.644
I don't have time to explain.
Where's your mother?

07:12.679 --> 07:15.647
- Did she get to Freya in time?
- No. She got arrested for murder.

07:15.681 --> 07:18.817
- They came and took her away.
- What?! Freya's still in there?

07:18.851 --> 07:20.685
Oh, my God, we are so
monumentally screwed!

07:25.024 --> 07:29.328
- I-I don't understand what's happening.
- There are consequence, Ingrid.

07:29.362 --> 07:32.029
You can't just bring
someone back from the dead

07:32.064 --> 07:33.497
<i>without consequences.</i>

07:33.532 --> 07:35.166
I am so pissed off at your mom right now

07:35.200 --> 07:37.335
for not teaching you girls
how to handle your gifts.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.638
- This is all her fault.
- What do you mean, consequences?

07:40.672 --> 07:44.008
There's a price. A spell like that
always carries a price.

07:44.042 --> 07:45.609
What kind of price?

07:45.644 --> 07:48.813
If you resurrect someone you love,
then someone you love has to die.

07:48.847 --> 07:51.349
- Freya.
- Not if we can get to her in time.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.384
Come on, let's go.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.523
What are you doing?

07:59.557 --> 08:03.360
I want you to burn.
Just like I did in that desert.

08:03.394 --> 08:05.395
I want you to suffocate.

08:05.430 --> 08:09.499
<i>I want you to feel every ounce</i>

08:09.533 --> 08:11.968
of pain that you made me feel,

08:12.003 --> 08:16.707
and then...
I want you to die.

08:20.912 --> 08:23.380
Don't you have
any powers at all?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.386
- I'm disappointed in you.
- What?

08:29.421 --> 08:32.322
The old Freya would have
put up much more of a fight.

08:36.561 --> 08:38.895
<i>I really did love you once.</i>

08:38.929 --> 08:41.899
My little rebel.
My little... 

08:41.933 --> 08:43.333
My wild child.

08:43.368 --> 08:45.302
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

08:48.807 --> 08:51.342
Ow!

08:51.376 --> 08:54.545
- Go to hell!
- I've already been.

08:54.579 --> 08:55.812
Now it's your turn.

09:01.986 --> 09:04.721
Good-bye, Freya.

09:05.656 --> 09:09.727
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

09:12.965 --> 09:14.899
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

09:23.005 --> 09:24.739
Hey, you see Freya leave?

09:24.774 --> 09:27.142
- Can't find her.
- No.

09:29.612 --> 09:33.414
<i>Killian?
What are you doing here?</i>

09:33.449 --> 09:35.817
Drinking, oddly enough.

09:45.194 --> 09:48.363
Mom worries about you.
You stopped e-mailing.

09:48.397 --> 09:50.998
You don't even bother
sending postcards anymore.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.934
You shouldn't punish her
'cause you're mad at me.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.268
I'm not mad at you.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.503
<i>What, you've been mad at
me since birth. You still</i>

09:56.538 --> 09:58.539
haven't figured out, it's not
my fault you're a screw-up.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.676
You want to tell me
what you're doing here?

10:01.710 --> 10:07.649
I haven't seen you in five years.
What do you want, Killian?

10:08.551 --> 10:10.018
I don't want anything from you.

10:10.052 --> 10:11.553
You always want something from me,

10:11.587 --> 10:14.022
only usually you just end
up taking it without asking.

10:26.235 --> 10:28.270
Want to go again?

10:33.209 --> 10:34.208
It's good to see you, Dash.

10:38.247 --> 10:41.882
Hey, uh, excuse me.
You seen Freya?

10:41.917 --> 10:46.354
- No, I haven't seen her.
- I... Okay. Okay.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.871
<i>I don't even
understand what's going on.</i>

11:02.906 --> 11:05.674
An old boyfriend of
Freya's wants to kill her?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.743
- Yeah.
- Is it Josh Meyer from high school?

11:07.777 --> 11:09.845
No, honey, this is a
boyfriend from a long time ago.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.214
- From another life.
- What do you mean?

11:12.248 --> 11:14.349
Okay, you and Freya have lived and died.

11:14.384 --> 11:16.618
At least a dozen times.
It's part of your curse.

11:16.653 --> 11:18.353
- We're cursed?
- Every woman in this family.

11:18.388 --> 11:19.922
- We're all cursed.
- Why?

11:19.956 --> 11:21.223
Okay, I'm gonna leave
it up to your mother

11:21.257 --> 11:24.226
to explain that to you.
But the point is you've lived before

11:24.260 --> 11:25.560
but you don't remember a thing,
neither does Freya.

11:25.595 --> 11:29.364
So this guy, Freya's old boyfriend,
why is he even doing this?

11:29.399 --> 11:31.433
Okay, that's probably
another thing you should know.

11:31.467 --> 11:35.371
All the women in this family,
we have really bad luck with men.

11:35.405 --> 11:37.706
And that's... part of the curse?

11:37.741 --> 11:40.643
No, we're just really stupid that way.

11:45.482 --> 11:50.153
- Harrison.
- Joanna. Ah!

11:51.956 --> 11:54.090
<i>Wow.</i>

11:54.125 --> 11:58.262
It is so nice to be back in East End.
I do love the salt air.

11:58.296 --> 12:00.430
You got here fast. Even for you.

12:00.465 --> 12:03.333
- They make better cars now.
- That's true.

12:03.367 --> 12:08.405
- How long has it been?
- Oh, I'd say at least 50 years.

12:08.439 --> 12:10.006
God, you look exactly the same.

12:10.041 --> 12:13.242
Immortality'll do that.
You, on the other hand, I mean,

12:13.276 --> 12:14.743
you, God, you look better than ever.

12:14.778 --> 12:18.113
Maybe not much longer.
Apparently someone's trying to kill me.

12:18.148 --> 12:20.417
Is that even possible?

12:20.451 --> 12:24.688
It's difficult, but it's not impossible.
And someone's pretty intent on trying.

12:25.890 --> 12:29.826
I can't stop a vicious psychopath
from trying to kill you.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.862
But I can sure as hell
try to get you out of here.

12:31.896 --> 12:35.198
The sooner the better.
My girls are in danger.

12:45.811 --> 12:48.747
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

13:16.977 --> 13:20.314
Well, we got one
problem solved at least.

13:20.348 --> 13:22.049
Just spoke to the judge.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.551
Guess who's about to
become a free woman.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.387
- Thanks to me.
- How did you pull that off?

13:26.421 --> 13:28.188
Just because I lack the
power to cast spells,

13:28.223 --> 13:31.659
doesn't mean I don't have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

13:31.693 --> 13:34.295
<i>I may not be gifted with magic,
but I know people who are.</i>

13:34.329 --> 13:36.898
They see things.
Dig up dirt.

13:36.932 --> 13:39.666
You called in a favor with
one of your shady clients?

13:39.701 --> 13:43.070
Might I remind you that you are
one of my shady clients, my dear.

13:43.104 --> 13:45.739
I just got you bail on a murder charge.

13:45.773 --> 13:47.975
- You should be hugging me right now.
- I'm innocent.

13:48.009 --> 13:51.045
I don't need shady dealings
to get me out of this.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.131
- Just a good lawyer.
- Well, you're also gonna

13:53.132 --> 13:56.751
need a lot of money because
bail is set at a million bucks.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.896
<i>Freya.</i>

14:30.619 --> 14:32.620
It's you.

14:38.395 --> 14:39.829
Wow.

14:41.164 --> 14:42.698
Guess you're feeling better.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.066
<i>Fire's out, people.</i>

14:44.101 --> 14:46.301
- What are you doing here?
- Next round's on the house.

14:46.336 --> 14:47.869
What the hell happened to you?

14:47.904 --> 14:48.904
I-I couldn't find you.

14:48.938 --> 14:50.238
And then all of a
sudden I smelled smoke.

14:50.273 --> 14:51.606
And there you were
passed out in the bathroom

14:51.641 --> 14:53.475
in the middle of this insane fire.

14:53.509 --> 14:58.947
I don't know what happened.
I was playing darts with Killian.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.084
And then I had to go to the bathroom.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.419
That's the last thing I remember.

15:03.453 --> 15:08.325
- You were playing darts with Killian?
- Yeah, I just... I'm not sure.

15:08.359 --> 15:11.295
<i>I must have passed out or something.</i>

15:11.329 --> 15:13.230
Although I had the weirdest dream.

15:13.264 --> 15:18.334
I was at a speakeasy.
And this guy was trying to kill me.

15:18.368 --> 15:22.772
Hey, well, look, I'm, uh...
I'm just glad you're okay.

15:24.175 --> 15:26.275
Ah, I must look terrible right now.

15:26.310 --> 15:30.146
No.
You look adorable.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.748
Like a little 19th
century chimney sweep.

15:32.783 --> 15:35.618
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm not, I mean it.

15:42.226 --> 15:46.662
- You walked through fire for me.
- Well, yeah, of course.

15:58.307 --> 16:01.477
- Oh, what the hell happened in here?
- Uh-oh, I feel weird.

16:01.511 --> 16:03.512
What do you mean?

16:03.547 --> 16:06.983
That resurrection spell that you
did on me? It's making me feel woozy.

16:07.017 --> 16:10.153
There's a 50% chance I may
turn into cat against my will,

16:10.187 --> 16:12.722
<i>in which case I may be
stuck like that for a while.</i>

16:12.756 --> 16:14.723
So please tell me you remember
the chant I taught you.

16:14.758 --> 16:17.492
- You may have to do this alone.
- Oh, God, please don't even say that!

16:23.365 --> 16:24.699
You've got to be kidding me.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.297
Well, maybe we're too late.
What do we do?

16:29.381 --> 16:31.287
Oh, that's very helpful.

16:31.941 --> 16:34.977
Mysticum flamma aperire pictura.

16:35.012 --> 16:37.780
Mysticum flamma aperire pictura.

16:38.115 --> 16:42.984
Mysticum flamma aperire pictura.
Come on, Freya, come back.

16:43.019 --> 16:46.217
- Mysticum flamma aperire pictura.
- Ingrid? What are you doing?

16:46.252 --> 16:47.154
How the hell did you
get out of the picture?

16:47.188 --> 16:50.424
- How did you know about my dream?
- It wasn't a dream.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.060
We have to go.
Mom's in trouble.

16:54.129 --> 16:55.363
<i>Come on.</i>

16:55.397 --> 16:57.398
- Is that Aunt Wendy's cat?
- Yes.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.833
<i>What is going on?</i>

17:10.529 --> 17:15.710
Here. Call Ingrid at that number.
Read that to her.

17:15.744 --> 17:16.916
What does it mean?

17:16.951 --> 17:18.484
- She'll figure it out.
- Really?

17:18.519 --> 17:21.421
You're speaking in code now?
Are you afraid I'm gonna find out

17:21.454 --> 17:22.888
where your money is, I'm gonna steal it?

17:22.923 --> 17:26.425
We do have a history, Harrison.
A long, twisted one.

17:26.461 --> 17:28.829
If you don't trust me,
then why did you hire me?

17:28.863 --> 17:32.733
You're the only lawyer who
knows the truth about me.

17:32.767 --> 17:36.102
You're the only one who'd
believe I'm innocent.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.607
- We're witches?
- We're witches.

17:40.641 --> 17:43.009
But you don't even
believe in that stuff.

17:43.044 --> 17:46.313
Let's just say it's been a night
of extreme cognitive dissonance.

17:46.347 --> 17:48.281
And Mom knew?

17:48.316 --> 17:50.117
She's just been lying
to us our whole lives?

17:50.151 --> 17:52.086
Pretty much. Also, you
and I have lived and died

17:52.121 --> 17:54.022
a bunch of times
but we don't remember,

17:54.056 --> 17:55.524
'cause there's a curse on our heads.

17:55.558 --> 17:58.426
- What?
- And that is not Aunt Wendy's cat.

17:58.461 --> 18:00.194
That is Aunt Wendy.

18:02.697 --> 18:06.799
- Oh, this isn't happening.
- Also, Mom got arrested for murder.

18:08.035 --> 18:09.118
- Holy crap...
- Ooh, hey, girls.

18:09.119 --> 18:12.305
Um, do you have my clothes? 'Cause it
is colder than a witch's teat back here.

18:12.339 --> 18:13.640
- Yeah.
- Wait, uh...

18:13.674 --> 18:16.209
Why was Mom arrested for murder?

18:16.243 --> 18:17.710
<i>Oh, no, relax, it was the shifter.</i>

18:17.745 --> 18:19.712
- The what?
- The shape shifter.

18:19.747 --> 18:22.065
Guys, I got a voice mail.
It's Mom's lawyer.

18:22.066 --> 18:24.384
Listen, people like this,
we all have different gifts.

18:24.419 --> 18:27.154
Okay, some of us can shift
into animal form like me.

18:27.188 --> 18:29.823
And others can make ourselves
look like other people.

18:29.857 --> 18:31.157
- Can I do that?
- No.

18:31.192 --> 18:32.959
- Can I fly?
- No, listen.

18:32.994 --> 18:34.461
This shifter that's after your mom,

18:34.495 --> 18:36.963
he or she has put himself
in your mother's form,

18:36.998 --> 18:39.633
killed Bill Thatcher,
leaving Maura as a witness.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.401
Then the bitch came to your house

18:41.435 --> 18:42.635
earlier tonight and stabbed me to death.

18:42.669 --> 18:44.971
- But you're alive.
- Yeah, that's kind of my fault.

18:45.005 --> 18:47.474
- I did something stu...
- No, I have nine lives. It's a cat thing.

18:47.508 --> 18:50.911
Oh, okay.
So what did the lawyer say?

18:50.945 --> 18:54.315
He said we need to come up
with a hundred grand for Mom's bail,

18:54.349 --> 18:57.058
but don't worry the money
is with Aunt Marilyn.

18:57.093 --> 18:59.778
Aunt Marilyn? That's
impossible. She's dead.

18:59.813 --> 19:01.655
We used to visit her at the
cemetery when we were kids.

19:01.690 --> 19:02.756
I know, I don't know what that means.

19:02.791 --> 19:07.761
It means that your mother
is a crafty little witch.

19:07.796 --> 19:09.230
And we're gonna need some shovels.

19:09.264 --> 19:10.865
Uh...

19:19.209 --> 19:21.777
Can't believe this
thing is still kicking.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.480
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:26.449 --> 19:28.450
Wow.

19:29.986 --> 19:32.454
God, I used to love this boat so much.

19:35.392 --> 19:38.628
<i>Hey, remember when we were kids?
Dad used to let us</i>

19:38.662 --> 19:42.899
sleep out on the deck in the summer?
We called it camping.

19:43.533 --> 19:46.290
What do you want, Dash?

19:47.505 --> 19:52.742
Look, you're still my brother.
Despite what you did.

19:55.179 --> 19:59.783
I wanted to give you this.
Use it, get back on your feet.

20:00.952 --> 20:03.387
No, thanks.
I'm good.

20:03.421 --> 20:04.621
Just take the check, Killian.

20:04.655 --> 20:08.792
<i>You're gonna need it
for when you leave town.</i>

20:08.827 --> 20:10.594
The sooner, the better.

20:12.070 --> 20:15.267
I just got here.
Kind of like it.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.536
Think I'll stay a while.

20:22.709 --> 20:27.446
<i>You know, there was a time,
I would have laid down my life for you.</i>

20:28.682 --> 20:30.415
Now, when I see you, it's all I can do

20:30.450 --> 20:32.684
not to rip you apart with my bare hands.

20:36.123 --> 20:39.239
I know the feeling.

20:40.628 --> 20:43.359
Be careful, Killian.

21:00.214 --> 21:03.883
Hi, honey.
Yes, I'm on my way.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.152
I'll be home soon.
I love you, too.

21:06.186 --> 21:07.153
Don't scream.

21:07.187 --> 21:09.522
<i>I don't have any money.</i>

21:09.556 --> 21:12.524
I don't want your money.

21:14.728 --> 21:17.270
But I will take your car.

21:17.931 --> 21:22.435
<i>Freya escaped and she
knows what she is now.</i>

21:25.238 --> 21:29.808
But don't worry.
I'm still gonna kill her.

21:32.178 --> 21:35.982
I have to say, this is
really strangely invigorating.

21:36.016 --> 21:37.817
I missed doing stuff
like this with you girls.

21:37.851 --> 21:39.653
I don't get it.
We're witches.

21:39.654 --> 21:42.804
Can't we just snap our fingers,
make a bunch of money appear?

21:42.839 --> 21:45.049
No, n-no, we don't do it that
way. You can't just conjure

21:45.050 --> 21:47.259
up a TV or a car or a million
dollars out of thin air.

21:47.294 --> 21:49.495
It has to come from somewhere.
You'd be stealing.

21:49.529 --> 21:50.762
But you're saying it's possible?

21:50.796 --> 21:52.363
Why are you always
such a little criminal?

21:52.398 --> 21:54.332
It's not like you weren't
thinking the same thing.

21:54.366 --> 21:55.833
I actually wasn't.

21:55.868 --> 21:58.503
<i>I can't believe Aunt Marilyn isn't real.</i>

21:58.537 --> 22:01.006
You know, you got to
give it to your mom.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.241
She created a dead person

22:02.275 --> 22:05.177
so that she could bury
her money in plain sight,

22:05.212 --> 22:07.993
bring you here as little girls
so that you would remember it

22:08.028 --> 22:10.550
if you ever needed it someday.
That is fairly ingenious.

22:10.584 --> 22:14.554
- That is textbook Joanna.
- Actually none of this is textbook.

22:14.622 --> 22:18.191
- Oh, yes...
- Seriously, a little help?

22:20.039 --> 22:21.852
Fine.

22:22.063 --> 22:25.298
So, what was I like
before, in my other lives?

22:25.332 --> 22:28.468
- Was I different?
- No, you were pretty much the same...

22:28.502 --> 22:32.472
wild, headstrong, fun,
rebellious, pigheaded,

22:32.507 --> 22:34.541
always in love, and very dramatic.

22:34.576 --> 22:36.477
I am not dramatic.

22:36.512 --> 22:40.549
- Please, you're Oscar-worthy.
- What was Ingrid like?

22:40.583 --> 22:44.753
- Timid, bookish, boringly rational?
- Rationality is not boring.

22:44.787 --> 22:47.054
<i>You'd be surprised how
different Ingrid was.</i>

22:47.089 --> 22:49.823
I mean, you've always been
smart... annoyingly smart...

22:49.858 --> 22:52.993
but you weren't always so scared.

22:53.027 --> 22:54.661
<i>I mean, I don't know if
that's the way you've been</i>

22:54.696 --> 22:56.397
<i>raised this time.</i>

22:56.431 --> 22:58.333
You're so much more
powerful than you know.

23:01.003 --> 23:05.340
I don't feel powerful.
I just feel strange.

23:07.043 --> 23:10.245
Everything I thought I knew is over.

23:10.279 --> 23:12.513
<i>So far, I got to say, I preferred being</i>

23:12.547 --> 23:15.398
- a shy librarian.
- Well, I always

23:15.433 --> 23:18.419
knew deep down, and Mom
made me think I was crazy.

23:18.453 --> 23:20.655
- Ah. She was doing that to protect you.
- That doesn't make it right.

23:20.689 --> 23:23.707
I'm glad she didn't tell me.
I wish I didn't know now.

23:23.742 --> 23:27.376
Ingrid, honey, being what
we are means a lot of things,

23:27.411 --> 23:28.669
not all bad and scary.

23:28.704 --> 23:31.799
Some of it's pretty great and exciting.
You'll see... it's a gift.

23:31.834 --> 23:35.319
It's a curse.
We are literally cursed.

23:35.386 --> 23:37.721
Oh, guys.
Look.

23:49.567 --> 23:50.901
Wait, guys,

23:50.935 --> 23:53.036
what if we're wrong?
What if there's a body inside?

23:53.071 --> 23:54.805
Well, there's only one way to find out.

23:57.441 --> 23:59.042
<i>Okay.</i>

24:08.285 --> 24:10.420
Holy shit.

24:10.454 --> 24:12.855
- Aunt Marilyn.
- Whoo!

24:15.158 --> 24:17.859
<i>- This is...!
- Whoo!</i>

24:17.894 --> 24:20.862
<i>Thank you, Aunt Marilyn!</i>

24:29.995 --> 24:33.131
Hey.
You feeling better?

24:33.165 --> 24:37.135
Oh, that shower was just
what I needed. Oh, thank you.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.638
Thank all of you for
everything you did tonight.

24:39.672 --> 24:42.401
I-I know it's been difficult.

24:42.942 --> 24:49.247
And, Freya, I am so sorry
that you got dragged into this.

24:49.281 --> 24:52.017
I wanted to deal
with the shifter on my own.

24:52.051 --> 24:54.419
I never wanted to put
any of you in danger.

24:54.453 --> 24:59.424
So, why is this
shifter coming after you anyway?

24:59.459 --> 25:03.195
You're an art teacher.
You don't even kill spiders.

25:03.229 --> 25:05.663
Ingrid, your mom is a badass.

25:05.698 --> 25:07.767
She has powers you can't
even begin to comprehend.

25:07.801 --> 25:13.072
She's been alive a very long time
and she has a lot of enemies.

25:13.106 --> 25:14.506
I wouldn't say a lot.

25:14.541 --> 25:19.111
So, there are a lot
of other people out there like us?

25:19.145 --> 25:22.381
No... well, just
enough to cause trouble.

25:22.415 --> 25:24.049
Uh, th-the important thing is that,

25:24.084 --> 25:27.586
now that you know what you are,
you must keep it to yourselves.

25:27.621 --> 25:29.789
You tell no one.

25:29.823 --> 25:34.462
Not even Dash, Freya.
Freya?

25:34.496 --> 25:37.398
This is a rule that all
of our kind must abide.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.267
We never reveal ourselves.

25:39.301 --> 25:43.103
The first rule of witch club:
don't talk about witch club.

25:43.137 --> 25:46.706
Freya,
do you understand?

25:46.740 --> 25:49.809
Sure.
You want me to lie

25:49.843 --> 25:52.445
to everyone like you
lied to me my entire life.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.762
I was only trying
to protect you.

25:54.879 --> 25:58.251
By telling me I was crazy
because I sensed the truth?

25:58.285 --> 26:00.887
How very protective of you!

26:00.921 --> 26:04.791
I'm sorry.
I, I understand why you're angry.

26:04.826 --> 26:07.259
You're sorry? Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

26:07.294 --> 26:10.129
You're sorry I found out,
you're not sorry you lied.

26:10.163 --> 26:13.933
I had my reasons, Freya!

26:13.967 --> 26:15.384
You can't possibly understand

26:15.385 --> 26:18.271
the price we've had to pay
for what we are,

26:18.305 --> 26:20.773
the suffering we've had to endure.

26:20.807 --> 26:26.745
I made a choice because
you deserve better.

26:26.779 --> 26:28.980
You deserve a normal life.

26:29.015 --> 26:31.316
Normal?
Are you kidding me?

26:31.350 --> 26:32.651
You sent me to therapy.

26:32.685 --> 26:34.987
You made me think there
was something wrong with me

26:35.021 --> 26:36.822
because I sensed the truth.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.787
I can never forgive you for that!

26:47.033 --> 26:49.968
She'll get over it... eventually.

26:52.472 --> 26:55.906
You believe that, you don't
know my daughter very well.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.713
<i>Hey.</i>

27:10.748 --> 27:11.847
<i>Hey.</i>

27:12.882 --> 27:17.451
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

27:17.485 --> 27:21.854
- What about Dash?
- I love Dash.

27:21.889 --> 27:24.556
You came here to tell me
you're in love with my brother?

27:24.591 --> 27:26.191
'Cause you could have
just texted me that.

27:26.225 --> 27:30.628
No, I just...
I know if I go see Dash, he's going

27:30.663 --> 27:34.130
to make it all better.
That's what he does,

27:34.165 --> 27:37.566
but I don't want someone
to fix it right now.

27:37.600 --> 27:43.003
Right now I just want to wallow
and be mad and feel messed up...

27:43.037 --> 27:47.639
and I get the feeling you're
pretty good at that.

27:47.673 --> 27:51.175
I don't think that's
actually a compliment.

27:51.210 --> 27:54.845
I meant it in a very complimentary way.

27:55.846 --> 28:00.649
- So, what's the problem?
- Oh, family drama.

28:00.683 --> 28:03.050
I think I'm familiar with that.

28:03.085 --> 28:04.685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:04.719 --> 28:05.885
Well, how do you handle it?

28:05.920 --> 28:09.889
Me?
I have a pretty effective technique.

28:09.923 --> 28:13.826
I get really, really mad and then I run

28:13.860 --> 28:17.028
as far away as possible,
as fast as I can.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.697
That's kind of my thing.

28:20.732 --> 28:24.868
- Sounds very healthy.
- Ah, it doesn't actually work.

28:24.902 --> 28:28.570
There's only so far you can run
until it all catches up with you.

28:31.407 --> 28:33.374
You know, you're a lot
smarter than you look.

28:34.776 --> 28:37.910
- Again, not a compliment.
- I just mean you're,

28:37.945 --> 28:39.878
you're different than you seem at first.

28:39.913 --> 28:43.448
- Good different or bad different?
- I don't know yet.

28:49.086 --> 28:53.655
- I don't think you should be here.
- I definitely shouldn't be here.

29:00.729 --> 29:02.362
So, what happened to you tonight?

29:02.396 --> 29:04.430
Can we just be a couple
of screwed up messes

29:04.464 --> 29:08.199
hanging out on your boat,
looking up at the sky, and not talking?

29:08.233 --> 29:10.233
Yeah.

29:11.602 --> 29:14.571
Yeah, I think I can do that.

29:23.079 --> 29:26.714
So you really think you
and I can just be friends,

29:26.748 --> 29:29.816
- ignore how we really feel
about each other?  - Shh.

29:29.850 --> 29:31.850
I said no talking.

29:42.325 --> 29:43.625
You need to go to bed.

29:45.094 --> 29:47.996
I can't.
I'm too freaked out.

29:48.030 --> 29:52.132
Because of that spell I did on you,
someone I love is going to die,

29:52.166 --> 29:54.533
and I keep thinking about
all the people I love.

29:54.568 --> 29:56.302
And you know what's strange?

29:56.336 --> 29:58.970
There are a lot more
of them than I thought.

29:59.405 --> 30:03.240
I don't know
if that's good news or bad.

30:03.274 --> 30:07.109
Ingrid, it may not happen right away.
It could take a month, a year even.

30:07.143 --> 30:11.745
So it'll just be like a giant sword
hanging over my head until it falls?

30:11.780 --> 30:13.547
Ingrid, that's life for everyone.

30:13.581 --> 30:16.583
We have a giant sword
hanging over our head.

30:16.617 --> 30:18.452
We just like to pretend that we don't.

30:18.486 --> 30:21.655
Okay, but can't we undo this somehow?

30:21.689 --> 30:23.789
No.
Balance has to be restored.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.557
It's a universal law.

30:25.592 --> 30:28.660
So, how come you don't
want me to tell Mom?

30:28.694 --> 30:34.263
It wouldn't change anything, and
she has a lot on her mind right now.

30:34.297 --> 30:37.899
Plus, we haven't been on speaking
terms for over a hundred years,

30:37.933 --> 30:39.707
and I don't want to risk
her being mad at me again.

30:39.778 --> 30:43.970
- It wasn't your fault, it was mine.
- It wasn't anyone's fault.

30:44.005 --> 30:46.807
You're gonna get better
at this, I promise.

30:46.841 --> 30:49.809
Remember, I have known you
for over several centuries,

30:49.844 --> 30:52.477
and you're probably the
most gifted one of us all.

30:53.963 --> 30:56.598
But I don't want to be.

30:56.633 --> 30:59.768
My life before... maybe it
wasn't the most exciting,

30:59.802 --> 31:05.539
but it was comfortable and safe,
and I liked it.

31:05.574 --> 31:07.942
I wish I didn't know
any of this... I hate it.

31:07.976 --> 31:10.611
I just want things to go
back to the way they were.

31:10.645 --> 31:13.914
<i>Oh, come here, sweetie pie.
Oh.</i>

31:20.455 --> 31:22.889
<i>What's going on?</i>

31:22.923 --> 31:25.925
It's just a lot for her
to take in all at once.

31:28.573 --> 31:30.599
<i>I'm fine.</i>

31:31.198 --> 31:33.867
<i>Oh, sweetheart.</i>

31:35.670 --> 31:37.838
I'm sorry.

31:37.873 --> 31:40.475
I never meant for any
of this to hurt you.

31:40.510 --> 31:45.147
I know, it's just... it's strange.

31:45.181 --> 31:47.083
I mean, everything is different now.

31:47.117 --> 31:52.321
Everything looks different to me,
even that painting over there.

31:52.355 --> 31:56.915
Oh, that's because it is.
Doug isn't in it anymore.

32:00.329 --> 32:04.633
You know the photo in the bar,
the one that Freya was in.

32:04.667 --> 32:06.502
Do we know what happened to it?

32:06.536 --> 32:09.705
No, I don't know, it got a little burnt.

32:09.739 --> 32:11.606
So we don't actually
know what happened to him.

32:11.641 --> 32:12.967
- Wait, you don't think...?
- What?

32:13.067 --> 32:15.377
He escaped once.
Why would we take the risk?

32:15.411 --> 32:17.412
You're right, let's go to the bar.

32:24.152 --> 32:27.889
I should go.

32:27.923 --> 32:32.426
- I would hug you, but...
- Eh, I'd probably like it too much.

32:35.732 --> 32:37.399
Hey, you.

32:38.735 --> 32:40.268
Thanks.

32:54.451 --> 32:58.254
Freya, please call me back.
It's vitally important.

32:58.288 --> 33:01.223
<i>It's last call, people, one more round.</i>

34:08.337 --> 34:11.605
Aquae facient solida.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.942
<i>Aquae facient solida.</i>

34:17.658 --> 34:19.599
Freya!

34:29.659 --> 34:31.998
Candle.

34:32.728 --> 34:36.331
Freya, Freya, Freya!

34:37.733 --> 34:39.766
Freya, Freya, Freya.

34:40.803 --> 34:42.938
Hey.

34:46.641 --> 34:49.610
Mysticum pictura absorbueriteum.

35:07.496 --> 35:11.399
Here...
you want to do the honors?

35:11.433 --> 35:13.067
Maybe we should keep it on the wall.

35:13.101 --> 35:15.896
Hates when we do that.
We did that once.

35:15.931 --> 35:17.706
Didn't work out so well. We need to
put this where no one will find it.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.474
Maybe we should just burn it.

35:19.509 --> 35:22.744
No, he would die.
We don't do that.

35:23.579 --> 35:26.247
- Anymore.
- It's not that bad

35:26.281 --> 35:27.548
of a painting to be stuck in anyway.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.083
It's way better than the last one.

35:29.117 --> 35:31.485
I, for one, don't mind
if he suffers a little.

35:31.519 --> 35:35.389
<i>The important thing is,
he'll be safe here and we'll be safe.</i>

35:39.427 --> 35:41.328
Do you realize you were almost burned

35:41.329 --> 35:43.230
alive and drowned all in one night?

35:43.264 --> 35:47.401
- Yep, so far being a witch kind of sucks.
- It'll get better, I promise.

35:47.435 --> 35:50.037
Well, it'd better not get any worse.

35:54.275 --> 35:59.012
- I'm still mad at you.
- I know.

35:59.046 --> 36:03.217
And I am getting really
freaking tired of digging.

36:12.961 --> 36:14.662
Hello, ladies.

36:20.668 --> 36:22.636
Hey.

36:22.670 --> 36:24.638
Dare I even ask?

36:26.073 --> 36:30.277
It's a long, crazy story.

36:30.311 --> 36:33.280
Well, look, I, uh, I heard
about what happened...

36:33.314 --> 36:36.316
- your mom and the charges.
- Yeah, it's pretty nuts.

36:36.351 --> 36:39.053
We're not that worried, though.
I mean, she's innocent.

36:39.087 --> 36:41.289
Of course. Look, if
there's anything I can do,

36:41.323 --> 36:42.958
all right,
I'll get her the best lawyer

36:42.992 --> 36:45.961
- I can find.
- It's okay, we got it covered.

36:50.266 --> 36:53.435
- You coming?
- Yeah.

36:55.038 --> 37:00.207
Oh, my bed.
It's so wonderful.

37:00.242 --> 37:04.378
<i>Babe, seriously, what
the hell is going on?</i>

37:05.680 --> 37:08.215
I had a really, really weird night.

37:11.086 --> 37:15.922
Freya... you know you
can tell me anything.

37:20.228 --> 37:24.764
Would you love me even
if you found out I was a total mess?

37:26.467 --> 37:28.467
Yes.

37:29.970 --> 37:33.607
Yeah, but I love you
because you're a mess.

37:33.641 --> 37:38.112
I mean, you are crazy and hilarious

37:38.146 --> 37:40.414
and dramatic and sweet and...

37:40.449 --> 37:43.950
and you think you're psychic and yet
you're always losing your keys

37:43.984 --> 37:47.187
and forgetting where you
parked your car, and it's okay.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.555
It's okay, I love it.

37:49.991 --> 37:54.294
I'm in...
forever, no matter what.

37:58.934 --> 38:02.803
- Oh, babe, you're all banged up.
- It's nothing.

38:02.837 --> 38:05.472
No, let me take care of that.
I'll get you some ice.

38:08.576 --> 38:11.545
You don't run away
from problems, do you?

38:11.580 --> 38:16.083
You run toward them...
and fix them.

38:16.118 --> 38:21.822
Of course. That's what you
do for the people you love.

39:05.701 --> 39:09.370
<i>Why do you keep dealing those?
It's not going to change.</i>

39:09.404 --> 39:11.139
There's got to be a way.

39:11.173 --> 39:14.008
The girls have never
lived this long before.

39:15.477 --> 39:18.179
I don't think I can
take losing them again.

39:20.816 --> 39:24.486
We won't.
We'll find the shifter

39:24.521 --> 39:27.923
and we'll keep the girls alive
as long as we can.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.528
Does that mean you're staying?

39:34.731 --> 39:37.667
Have you ever seen me
run away from a fight?
