THE LAST EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:07.757 --> 00:10.760
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:10.844 --> 00:13.054
THE ARTISTS WERE OUT FOR BLOOD.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.598
- THE SMELL OF BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE MONEY TO ME.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.726
- YOU'RE A SELF-ABSORBED PRICK
OF AN ASS[bleep].

00:17.809 --> 00:18.935
CLEEN TRIES TO GET INTO MY HEAD.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.603
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO GET INTO HIS HEAD.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.397
- THE ONLY WAY THAT I'M [bleep]
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

00:22.480 --> 00:25.608
IS THAT I DO BETTER TATTOOS
THAN YOU, AND YOU'RE THREATENED.

announcer:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:27.777 --> 00:31.114
THE ARTISTS
WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH A LEGEND.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.575
- ANYONE THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I
HAVE A BLACK BELT IN TATTOOING.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.119
MASTER BLASTER.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.829
- THE ROOM FOR ERROR
JUST GOT SMALLER.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.291
- IT'S NOT ONLY AN HONOR,
BUT I AM SCARED [bleep]LESS.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.543
announcer: AND BIG EGOS
CAUSED BIGGER BLOWUPS.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.795
- IF I MAKE IT DOWNSTAIRS

00:45.879 --> 00:47.088
AND I COME BACK UP
THROUGH THAT GODDAMN DOOR...

00:47.172 --> 00:50.508

- YOU WATCH YOUR [bleep] ASS.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.011
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TATTOO
EVER AGAIN!

00:53.094 --> 00:54.387
YOU'RE DONE!

announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,
CLEEN, CRIS, MARK, AND EMILY

00:57.682 --> 01:00.268
WERE IN THE BOTTOM.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.352
- CLEEN.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.271
- YOU HAVE ONE
OF THE WORST FACES OF THE DAY.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.897
I COULD SEE HOW PEOPLE
IN A CANVAS JURY

01:04.980 --> 01:05.982
COULD BE DISSATISFIED BY THIS.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.401
- NO EXCUSES.
I'M EMBARRASSED.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.235
- MARK.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.321
- I'M REALLY
AT THE PINNACLE POINT.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.989
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING
MY TURNAROUND.

01:13.072 --> 01:13.990
- YOU REALLY MISSED THE MARK.

01:14.073 --> 01:17.452
- CRIS.
- IN YOUR DESIGN SELECTIONS,

01:17.535 --> 01:18.787
YOU'RE JUST NOT GIVING US
ANYTHING.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.247
FIGHT OR LET THE BIG GUYS PLAY.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.082
- EMILY.
- I BELONG HERE.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.000
- BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT
TO THE FINALE

01:24.083 --> 01:26.503
NOT KNOWING
HOW TO PUT ON A STENCIL?

01:26.586 --> 01:27.295
I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.506
- LET ME PROVE YOU WRONG, THEN.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.259
- EMILY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.140

EIGHT ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:39.224 --> 01:44.687

'CAUSE YOU ALREADY BEEN
DOWN THERE THREE TIMES.

THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING
YOUR ABILITY TO USE FINESSE.

04:07.538 --> 04:12.251
{\an8}- EVERY SINGLE PART
OF TATTOOING REQUIRES FINESSE:

04:12.335 --> 04:15.004
{\an8}HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOUR CANVAS,
HOW YOU PLACE THE IMAGE,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.673
{\an8}AND HOW YOU ACTUALLY
PERFORM THE TATTOO.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.757
- THE TOUGHER THE SITUATION,

04:18.841 --> 04:22.387
THE MORE FINESSE YOU NEED
TO CREATE A MASTERPIECE.

04:22.470 --> 04:26.766
FOR YOUR FLASH CHALLENGE TODAY,
YOU MUST TATTOO...

04:26.849 --> 04:29.769
AMPUTEES.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.020
WHEN THERE IS AN AMPUTATION,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.106
THE RESIDUAL LIMB
THAT'S LEFT BEHIND

04:33.189 --> 04:34.148
CAN BE BADLY TRAUMATIZED,

04:34.232 --> 04:37.986
LEAVING IT UNIQUELY SHAPED
AND SCARRED.

04:38.069 --> 04:42.407
TODAY YOU'LL HAVE FIVE HOURS
TO CREATE A PHENOMENAL TATTOO

04:42.490 --> 04:44.409
ON THE RESIDUAL LIMB.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.077
- IT'S HARD
TO TATTOO A RESIDUAL LIMB,

04:46.160 --> 04:47.870
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF SCAR TISSUE.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.831
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL

04:49.914 --> 04:52.166
{\an8}AND SHOW A LOT OF FINESSE
TO TATTOO IT.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.669
{\an8}- YOU MUST USE FINESSE
TO WORK WITH A CANVAS

04:54.752 --> 04:56.879

A DEVASTATING LOSS

04:56.963 --> 04:59.882

{\an8}LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.389
{\an8}- TO TATTOO AN AMPUTEE
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.809
{\an8}BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM
LOVE THAT PART OF THE BODY

05:09.892 --> 05:11.185
{\an8}THAT THEY'RE MISSING.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.646
- CANVASES, PLEASE TELL US
THE TATTOO

05:13.730 --> 05:14.939
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.399

05:21.988 --> 05:23.448
{\an8}EITHER
OF THE BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.074
THAT MANY LINES
ON THE RESIDUAL LIMB

05:25.158 --> 05:26.617
IS GONNA BE REALLY TOUGH.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.827
- I WANT TO HAVE FIRE

05:27.910 --> 05:30.872
THAT TURNS INTO A BEAUTIFUL,
SEXY WOMAN FIREFIGHTER.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.040
- I WANT TO GET MY RESIDUAL LIMB

05:32.123 --> 05:34.250
GOING DOWN INSIDE THE MOUTH
OF A GREAT WHITE SHARK.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.837
- I'D LIKE
TO GET A WILD WEST THEME.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.965
- A NEW BLOOMING FLOWER.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.134
- A WATERCOLOR PHOENIX.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.678
- I WANT TO GET A WINDOW
LOOKING INTO MY LEG.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.597
INSTEAD OF MUSCLE,
THERE'S PURPLE DRAGON SCALES

05:47.680 --> 05:51.392
WITH A BREAK IN THE GLASS
AND A FLOWER GROWING OUT OF IT.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.521
- HE JUST WANTS THE WHOLE
KITCHEN SINK IN ONE TATTOO.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.690
{\an8}IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.443
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,
YOU WILL CHOOSE A SKULL.

06:00.526 --> 06:05.615
THE NAME ON THE BOTTOM OF
THE SKULL WILL BE YOUR ARTIST.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.283
- ERIK?

06:07.366 --> 06:09.160
- JOSH.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.870
- JASON.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.206
- AARON.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.460
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.
- THAT'S ME.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.545
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE HARDEST ONE OF THE DAY,

06:19.629 --> 06:20.630
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.382
I'M UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.051
- CRIS.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.552
- MARK.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.679
- DON.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.974
- THE WINNER OF THE FLASH
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

06:32.058 --> 06:35.895
TO ASSIGN ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.815
YOU HAVE FIVE HOURS TO TATTOO,

06:38.898 --> 06:42.026
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.569
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
- HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.654
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.655
- WE'LL GO OVER HERE
TO MY STATION,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.281
AND WE'LL CHECK OUT SOME STUFF.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.992
{\an8}- TATTOOING AMPUTEES,
FINESSE IS DEFINITELY REQUIRED,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.953
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU TATTOO A LOT
OF DIFFERENT SKIN TEXTURES

06:52.036 --> 06:54.497
{\an8}ALL IN ONE TATTOO.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.332
{\an8}- WHERE IS IT EXACTLY THAT YOU
WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS?

06:56.415 --> 06:59.252
{\an8}- I'M THINKING MAYBE, LIKE,
ACROSS HERE LIKE THIS?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.045
- I'M LOOKING
FOR ALL OF THE TATTOOERS

07:01.129 --> 07:02.213
TO TAKE A TRAUMATIC INSTANCE
FOR A CLIENT

07:02.296 --> 07:03.422
AND TURN IT
INTO A THING OF BEAUTY

07:03.506 --> 07:06.384
THAT THEY WANT TO SHOW OFF
AND BE PROUD OF.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.718
- THE MAIN CONCEPT IDEA FOR ME

07:07.802 --> 07:11.848
IS THAT MY ARM IS GOING DOWN
INSIDE THE SHARK'S MOUTH.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.350
{\an8}- MY CANVAS
HAS UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.686
- SO THE NOSE
OF THE SHARK IS HERE,

07:16.769 --> 07:18.396
AND THEN THE MOUTH OPENS.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.480
- THE SIZE OF IT IS A LOT.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.191
- I WANT TO GIVE YOU
A REALLY NICE TATTOO ALSO.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.694
IF HE DOESN'T BUDGE
ON THIS DESIGN,

07:24.777 --> 07:27.446
IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY UPHILL BATTLE FOR ME.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.870
- I GOT HIT BY ANOTHER BIKER,

07:33.953 --> 07:34.495
AND I THOUGHT
THE WILD WEST THEME

07:34.579 --> 07:36.539
WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.541
- I'VE BEEN THROUGH A NASTY
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT MYSELF.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.375
{\an8}THREE YEARS AGO,
I WAS HIT BY A TEENAGE DRIVER

07:39.458 --> 07:40.710
{\an8}THAT WAS TEXTING
ON HER CELL PHONE

07:40.793 --> 07:44.213
{\an8}WHEN SHE RAN A RED LIGHT
AND HIT ME ON MY MOTORCYCLE.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
I WAS MESSED UP
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.049
MY PELVIS WAS CRACKED IN HALF.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.468
I WAS LAYING PARALYZED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.220
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I WOULD EVER WALK AGAIN.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.599
I'VE NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF
ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR PARALYSIS.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.017
THE DETERMINATION IT TOOK ME

07:56.100 --> 07:58.102
FROM GETTING FROM A WHEELCHAIR
BACK ON MY FEET

07:58.186 --> 07:58.978
IS WHAT'S GONNA HELP ME
IN THIS COMPETITION.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.439
NOBODY CAN HOLD ME DOWN.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.609
I'M GONNA WIN THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.568
- FOUR MORE HOURS, GUYS.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.742
{\an8}- I'M TATTOOING
THE ENTIRE RESIDUAL LIMB,

08:12.825 --> 08:13.951
{\an8}AND IT'S REALLY TRICKY,

08:14.035 --> 08:16.495
{\an8}BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME AREAS
THAT ARE NOT TATTOOABLE.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.415
I FEEL LIKE THE INK
MIGHT NOT HOLD THAT WELL

08:19.498 --> 08:21.918
BECAUSE THE SCAR TISSUE
IS GETTING DAMAGED SO QUICKLY,

08:22.001 --> 08:24.545
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS
THAT ARE TOO PAINFUL TO TATTOO.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.172
- OOH.
- STILL DOING OKAY?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.048
- THAT SIDE REALLY HURTS.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.592
- BEAR WITH ME.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.384
I HAVE TO REALLY
CREATE SOMETHING

08:30.468 --> 08:33.221
THAT HELPS HER DISTRACT HER EYE

08:33.304 --> 08:35.932
SO THAT WHEN SHE LOOKS
AT HER RESIDUAL LIMB,

08:36.015 --> 08:38.142
SHE SEES A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.568
- DOING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH. I'M SORRY.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.862
I CAN'T CONTROL THAT TWITCHING.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.948
LOOK AT THAT.
- OH, IT'S MOVING.

08:52.031 --> 08:56.494
{\an8}MY CANVAS' RESIDUAL LIMB
IS BOUNCING OFF OF THE TABLE.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.413
- MAN, I'M SO SORRY.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.582
I JUST--I DON'T WANT
TO SCREW YOU UP.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.626
- WE'RE NOT GONNA
SLOW DOWN FOR NOTHING.

09:03.709 --> 09:08.047
I'M GONNA HAVE TO USE FINESSE
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

09:08.130 --> 09:13.844
- TWO MORE HOURS.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.305
- I'M GONNA USE
SOME OF THESE SCARS AS TEXTURE.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.515
{\an8}RIGHT NOW IN THE COMPETITION,

09:17.598 --> 09:18.975
{\an8}WE'RE GETTING DOWN
TO THE NITTY-GRITTY.

09:19.058 --> 09:19.642
{\an8}I WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK AWESOME.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.312
- I WANT TO GET
THAT SKULL PICK,

09:23.396 --> 09:26.315
SO I CAN START KNOCKING
PEOPLE OFF ONE BY ONE.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.317
- THOSE SCALES
LOOK PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.652
- WE'RE GETTING THERE.

09:29.735 --> 09:33.948
{\an8}MY CANVAS HAS THIS CRAZY IDEA
OF A SHIELD, BROKEN GLASS,

09:34.031 --> 09:36.450
{\an8}DRAGON SCALES,
FLOWERS COMING OUT OF IT.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.785
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:37.868 --> 09:40.121
THERE AIN'T NOTHING
THAT I CAN'T DRAW.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.414
AFTER BEING ON THE BOTTOM,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.666
I REALLY NEED TO WIN THIS FLASH
CHALLENGE TO SHOW EVERYBODY

09:43.749 --> 09:47.628
THAT I'M THE TOP DOG
IN THIS COMPETITION.

09:47.712 --> 09:52.425
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.593
TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.430
NO MORE TATTOOING.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.806
- CRIS' PLACEMENT
LOOKS REALLY ODD.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.310
{\an8}HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SUITED
NOT DOING ANYTHING

10:02.393 --> 10:07.356
{\an8}THAN JUST SLAPPING THIS LITTLE,
TINY SHARK ON THIS GIANT CANVAS.

10:09.358 --> 10:13.321
{\an8}- JOSH, I REALLY LIKE
HOW YOU TOOK THE END OF THE LIMB

10:13.404 --> 10:14.989
{\an8}AND TURNED THAT INTO TEXTURES

10:15.072 --> 10:17.074
{\an8}THAT WORKED WITHIN THE FIRE
AND THE SMOKE.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.326
- REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

10:18.409 --> 10:19.201
THAT I ACTUALLY DID TATTOO
OVER THE SCAR TISSUE.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.745
- AND KNOWING
HOW TO WORK WITH IT

10:20.828 --> 10:22.663
AND CHANGE YOUR MACHINERY
TO ADAPT,

10:22.747 --> 10:24.081
THAT SHOWS FINESSE.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.042
- JASON.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.460
- WHAT I REALLY LIKE
ABOUT THIS TATTOO

10:27.543 --> 10:29.795
IS THE WAY IT FITS ON THE BODY,
AND THE FLOW OF THE TAIL

10:29.879 --> 10:32.214
THAT WRAPS AROUND THE KNEE
TOOK A LOT OF FINESSE.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.550
SO I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.760
- MARK.

10:35.843 --> 10:39.221
- I ASKED HIM TO DO
A WATERCOLORED, ABSTRACT FLOWER,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.974
AND I EMPHASIZED ABSTRACT,
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE CRAZINESS

10:42.058 --> 10:43.893
THAT WAS GOING ON
AFTER MY WRECK.

10:43.976 --> 10:44.894
- WHAT STANDS OUT STRONG
ABOUT THIS TATTOO

10:44.977 --> 10:47.605
IS HOW BRIGHT AND VIVID
THE COLORS ARE.

10:47.688 --> 10:51.567
I THINK IT'S A GREAT COLLAGE.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.568
- AARON.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.070
- I THINK THE OVERALL PLACEMENT
TO THIS

10:54.153 --> 10:55.404
REALLY LENDS ITSELF WELL
TO THE BODY PART.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.573
YOU WERE ABLE TO KEEP A FLOW,

10:57.656 --> 10:58.866
'CAUSE WHEN HIS LEG
REALLY BENDS,

10:58.949 --> 11:00.117
IT CONNECTS AND MOVES.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.787
LOOKS GREAT.
- THANKS, GUYS.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.788
- ERIK.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.581
- THE WAY
THAT YOU LEFT THE OLD TATTOO

11:05.664 --> 11:07.583
AND WORKED THE NEGATIVE SPACE
INTO YOUR CURRENT IMAGE

11:07.666 --> 11:10.002
TO LET THAT OLD TATTOO
KIND OF SIT THERE,

11:10.086 --> 11:11.504
IT FLOWS TOGETHER REALLY NICE.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.256
IT'S A SUPER STRONG,
BRIGHT, VERY DETAILED TATTOO,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.300
AND IT'S SUPER COOL.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.676
- DON.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.095
- NICE SOFT BLACK AND GRAY.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.346
WHEN THAT THING HEALS,

11:20.429 --> 11:21.847
IT'S GONNA HAVE
SOME REAL NICE, SMOOTH AREAS.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.140
OVERALL, IT LOOKS GOOD.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.392
IT'S READABLE.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.059
GOOD JOB.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.395
- CLEEN.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.354
- MAN, CAPTURING THE DETAIL
IN THE FLOWERS AND LEAVES,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.981
IT'S REALLY AMAZING.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.233
- IT SHOWS A LOT OF FINESSE,

11:32.316 --> 11:34.276
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE REALLY, REALLY TIGHT DETAIL

11:34.360 --> 11:35.569
AND THEN THE VERY BOLD LINES.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.280
GREAT DESIGN, CLEEN.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.698
- CRIS, I HAVE TO ASK,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.743
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU INITIALLY--
YOU WANTED.

11:42.827 --> 11:47.248
ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH HOW THIS CAME OUT?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.666
- IT WAS A COMPROMISE.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.417
- IT'S GOT
SOME REALLY NICE DETAILS.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.960
THE LIGHTNING BOLT IN THE EYE

11:51.043 --> 11:53.963
AND THE REALLY SMOOTH, SOFT,
GRAY SHADING THAT YOU HAVE

11:54.046 --> 11:56.465
IN THE UNDERSIDE OF THE NOSE
LEADING INTO THE JAW

11:56.549 --> 11:57.633
MAKES FOR REALLY HIGH CONTRAST.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.052
- CRIS MADE
AN EXECUTIVE DECISION

12:00.136 --> 12:01.512
NOT DOING THE SHARK
EATING THE GUY'S ARM.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.805
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE

12:02.888 --> 12:05.266
{\an8}THAT DON'T STEP
OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.519
{\an8}IT'S AN EASY WAY OUT.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.812
{\an8}- OOH!

12:09.895 --> 12:11.981
{\an8}- THIS DUDE IS FREAKING OUT.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.232
{\an8}IF MY CANVAS TAPS OUT ON ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TATTOO,

12:13.315 --> 12:15.693
{\an8}I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.027
- YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT, PAY
THE [bleep] PIPER OR GO HOME.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.989
- IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE
PRESSURE, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.374
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING FINESSE
BY TATTOOING ON AMPUTEES.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.667
WHO'S IN THE TOP FOR YOU?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.419
- JUST LOOKING AT THE WAY
JOSH WORKED

12:33.502 --> 12:35.796
WITH THAT HEAVY SCAR TISSUE
SHOWED A LOT OF FINESSE.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.214
SOME OF THAT SCAR WAS SO DEEP.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.341
NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA TATTOO COLOR
RIGHT ON TOP OF IT,

12:39.425 --> 12:41.719
SO HE HAD A LOT OF NEGATIVE
SPACE COMING THROUGH THE FIRE,

12:41.802 --> 12:42.970
MADE IT REALLY NICE.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.181
- AS WELL,
I THINK ERIK ALSO TATTOOED

12:45.264 --> 12:46.682
OVER A LOT OF SCAR TISSUE.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.310
IT HAS A REALLY GREAT SHAPE
AND FLOW.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.686
IT RIDES THE BODY REALLY WELL.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.022
OVERALL, REALLY STRONG,
REALLY SOLID,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.607
GOOD-QUALITY TATTOOING IN THERE.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.902
- JASON ALSO DID A REALLY NICE
JOB INCORPORATING THESE NEURONS

12:57.985 --> 13:00.863
THAT THIS CANVAS WANTED
INTO THE PHOENIX.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.864
- SEEING SOME
OF THE BEST LINE WORK

13:01.947 --> 13:04.742
WE'VE SEEN OUT OF JASON
ACROSS THAT KNEE.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.868
IT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.704
- CLEEN'S CANVAS
WANTED QUITE A FEW ELEMENTS.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.373
- AND IT ALL SEEMED TO FLOW
TOGETHER NICELY.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.919
REALLY STRONG DETAILS
IN THE LEAVES OF THAT FLOWER.

13:15.002 --> 13:15.878
- IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE.
- OH, YEAH.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.880
- I THINK WE'RE DECIDED,
THOUGH, YEAH?

13:17.963 --> 13:18.422
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.635
- LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

13:22.718 --> 13:27.473
TODAY YOU HAD TO SHOW FINESSE
BY TATTOOING AMPUTEES.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.807
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

13:28.891 --> 13:33.729
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

13:35.356 --> 13:37.858
ERIK.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.361
- THE WAY THAT YOU BROKE
THE NEGATIVE-SPACE SKIN

13:40.444 --> 13:41.403
INTO THE TOP OF THE TATTOO

13:41.487 --> 13:44.073
AND THEN THE WAY
IT FLOWED OFF AT THE BOTTOM,

13:44.156 --> 13:45.658
VERY SMOOTH TATTOOING.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.911
- ERIK, YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

13:48.994 --> 13:50.079
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.290
{\an8}- ERIK CAN GO AHEAD AND KEEP
WINNING FLASH CHALLENGES,

13:53.374 --> 13:54.333
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO AHEAD

13:54.416 --> 13:55.543
{\an8}AND KEEP WINNING
ELIMINATION TATTOOS.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.752
I DID THE BEST TATTOO,

13:56.835 --> 13:58.045
AND IT'S BULL[bleep]
THAT HE'S WINNING.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.005
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,
AND PREPARE TO MEET

14:00.089 --> 14:03.467
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.390
- WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WITH RIVALS LEFT.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.599
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FEEL LIKE

14:10.683 --> 14:12.101
YOUR RIVAL IS
ANY SORT OF A CHALLENGE TO YOU.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.060
- WELL, THE WHOLE THING IS,
HE'S NOT,

14:13.143 --> 14:15.187
BUT I DEFINITELY WANT
TO SHUT HIM UP.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.814
- AND NOW YOU HAVE
THE SKULL PICK,

14:16.897 --> 14:18.941
SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.734
I'VE BEEN HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JASON A FEW TIMES,

14:20.818 --> 14:23.529
AND I PRETTY MUCH KNOW
HOW THAT GOES.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.155
I WOULD LIKE
TO SETTLE MY RIVALRY WITH JASON

14:25.239 --> 14:26.448
JUST BECAUSE HE'S TALKING A LOT
OF [bleep] TO ME RIGHT NOW,

14:26.532 --> 14:29.076
ALWAYS SAYS HE A BETTER ARTIST
THAN ME AND ALL THIS [bleep].

14:29.159 --> 14:30.619
HE JUST HASN'T SHOWN IT YET.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.830
AND I WOULD LOVE
TO PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.290
{\an8}I HOPE THAT I GET ANOTHER CHANCE
TO GO UP AGAINST JASON,

14:34.373 --> 14:37.293
{\an8}SO I CAN BEAT HIS ASS.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.627
AS FAR AS WHO'S BEEN WINNING,
I THINK IT'S YOU, ME, AND CLEEN.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.920
- THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.882
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I SEE
IN THE FINALE.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.801
- YEP.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.608
- WELCOME TO
THIS WEEK'S ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.361
CHOKE, AND YOU'LL LOSE YOUR SHOT
AT $100,000,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.405
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

15:06.488 --> 15:09.700
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.662
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUÑEZ, MYSELF,

15:13.746 --> 15:14.830
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.833
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

15:17.916 --> 15:21.170
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

15:21.253 --> 15:24.131
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

15:24.214 --> 15:27.801
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.846
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:30.929 --> 15:32.514
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.351
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING FINESSE.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.020
{\an8}- FINESSE IS THE ABILITY TO
HANDLE ANY DIFFICULT SITUATION

15:38.103 --> 15:40.147
{\an8}WITH DELICACY AND EASE.

15:40.230 --> 15:44.026
- TODAY YOU MUST TATTOO
ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE AREAS

15:44.109 --> 15:46.028
OF THE BODY...

15:49.615 --> 15:51.367
THE SPINE.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.247
{\an8}- GETTING YOUR SPINE TATTOOED
IS INSANELY PAINFUL.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.499
THERE'S A BIG FEAR

15:58.582 --> 16:00.376
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SIT FOR THIS.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.877
- THE MUSCLES
AND VERTEBRAE IN THE BACK

16:01.960 --> 16:04.380
ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
OF THE SKIN.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.257
YOU MUST USE FINESSE
TO WORK EFFECTIVELY

16:07.341 --> 16:09.593
WITH THE CONTOURS OF THE BACK
AND HELP YOUR CANVAS

16:09.677 --> 16:13.555
THROUGH WHAT COULD BE
A VERY PAINFUL TATTOO.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.725
{\an8}- FINESSE IS VERY IMPORTANT
WHEN YOU'RE TATTOOING A SPINE,

16:16.809 --> 16:17.726
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU GOT TO KNOW
WHEN TO GIVE AND TAKE,

16:17.810 --> 16:20.062
{\an8}BECAUSE
IF THEIR SPINE PROTRUDES,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.564
{\an8}IT COULD REALLY HAMMER
RIGHT INTO THEIR BONE.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.192
- EVERY CANVAS WANTS
THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER

16:25.275 --> 16:26.568
AS ONE OTHER CANVAS.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.154
THAT MEANS YOU'LL ALL BE
GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD

16:29.238 --> 16:30.489
WITH ONE OTHER ARTIST.

16:30.572 --> 16:34.535
THE JUDGES WILL DIRECTLY COMPARE
YOUR WORK IN CRITIQUE.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.163
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.165
LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.005
ERIK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.342
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.510
YOU'RE ALSO DETERMINING

16:51.593 --> 16:52.970
WHICH ARTISTS TATTOO
HEAD-TO-HEAD,

16:53.053 --> 16:56.932
AND YOU COULD END UP
WITH A BIG ADVANTAGE.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.435
- MY STRATEGY IS TO PAIR UP
THE REMAINING RIVALS

16:59.518 --> 17:02.187
TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY
TO SEND EACH OTHER HOME.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.897
{\an8}GAME ON. LET THE BEST MAN WIN.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.022
SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?

17:05.107 --> 17:06.442
- EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
ON MY BACK.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.734
- [whistles]

17:07.818 --> 17:08.652
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.278
- EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
DOWN MY SPINE.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.320
- WHAT?

17:11.405 --> 17:12.531
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO DO
AN EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

17:12.614 --> 17:13.031
{\an8}DOWN SOMEBODY'S SPINE.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.828
- THAT THING IS SO FREAKING BIG.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.121
WE ONLY HAVE SIX HOURS.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.999
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?
- A REALISTIC SPINE.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.877
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?
- REALISTIC SPINE.

17:24.960 --> 17:25.961
- WITH VERTEBRAS AND ALL THAT?
- YEAH.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.630
- A POLYNESIAN WITH A HAWK
AT THE TOP.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.049
- DNA HELIX DOWN MY SPINE.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.970
{\an8}- THE SPINE HAS CONTOURS
AND CONCAVES.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.972
{\an8}DNA STRANDS ARE FULL
OF STRAIGHT LINES.

17:37.055 --> 17:40.434
{\an8}NOBODY WANTS THAT TATTOO.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.644
{\an8}- YEAH.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.855
{\an8}- I HOPE ERIK PUTS HIMSELF UP
AGAINST ME THIS TIME.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.190
PICK US A GOOD ONE, ERIK.
COME ON.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.485
I'M READY TO CHALLENGE HIM
AND SEND HIM HOME.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.736
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

17:50.819 --> 17:54.072
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.034
- EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.037
- JASON.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.330
- JOSH.
- OH.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.664
- GIVE ME
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.624
{\an8}I'M GONNA DO IT AMAZING.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.085
THIS DUDE IS HUGE.
THIS BUILDING IS HUGE.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.003
ME AS AN ARTIST?
I'M HUGE.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.214
JASON SHOULD BE TERRIFIED.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.007
- DON.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.929
- ERIK.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.765
{\an8}- I'M GONNA SHUT DON UP
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

18:19.848 --> 18:22.351
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA SEND HIS ASS HOME.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.983
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.904
- CRIS.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.280
{\an8}- CLEEN IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE
TOP GUYS IN THIS COMPETITION,

18:35.364 --> 18:39.201
{\an8}AND THE DNA STRAND IS ONE
OF THE MOST INTRICATE DESIGNS.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.036
ERIK DEFINITELY SCREWED ME OVER.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.288
I SEE WHAT YOU DID HERE.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.456
- MARK.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.375
- AARON.

18:47.835 --> 18:48.794
- REMEMBER, GUYS.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.546
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.173
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

18:53.257 --> 18:55.551
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

18:55.634 --> 18:57.594
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.682
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO YOUR CANVAS' SPINE.

19:01.765 --> 19:06.228
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.272
GOOD LUCK.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.315
{\an8}- THE SPINE CAN BE
A DIFFICULT AREA TO TATTOO,

19:10.399 --> 19:11.900
{\an8}'CAUSE IT IS VERY SENSITIVE,

19:11.984 --> 19:14.236
{\an8}AND THESE ARTISTS ARE DEALING
WITH THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.946
- CLEEN.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN? DON.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.948
- SO THE ARTISTS
REALLY NEED TO USE FINESSE

19:18.031 --> 19:19.199
TO PRODUCE A QUALITY TATTOO.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.494
- TELL ME WHAT YOUR IDEA IS.
- REALISTIC SPINE.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.620
- LIKE, YOU OPEN UP
A MEDICAL BOOK AND, LIKE,

19:23.704 --> 19:25.122
SOMETHING LIKE THAT? OKAY.
- YES, EXACTLY.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.582
- I'M THINKING WE CAN MAYBE
DO SOMETHING COOL WITH IT.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.374
- COOL?
- MM-HMM.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.543
- LIKE GOING IN AND OUT?
LIKE--

19:29.626 --> 19:31.128
- I LIKE THAT.

19:31.211 --> 19:34.256
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS A DOUBLE HELIX
DNA STRAND IN FULL COLOR.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.466
HOW BIG ARE YOU LOOKING
TO DO IT?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.426
- DOWN THE SPINE.
- DOWN THE WHOLE SPINE?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.928
- YEAH.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.263
- THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
FINISH THAT WITHIN SIX HOURS.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.764
IF I DO A FULL SPINE,
BY THE TIME I GET TO HERE,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.933
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUSH.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.393
- YOU KNOW HOW BIG
YOU WANT TO GO WITH THIS?

19:46.476 --> 19:48.061
- WELL, I HAVE MY LAST NAME
ACROSS MY BACK,

19:48.145 --> 19:50.022
SO WHATEVER YOU CAN GET DONE.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.774
{\an8}- MY CANVAS ALREADY HAS
EXISTING TATTOOS ON HIS BACK.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.984
WE'RE GONNA PUT IT
UNDERNEATH YOUR NAME,

19:54.067 --> 19:55.152
THEN, BASICALLY, RIGHT?
- YEP.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.486
- THAT ONLY LEAVES ME, LIKE,

19:56.570 --> 19:58.739
6 INCHES OF SPACE TO PUT
THIS BIG-ASS, GIANT MONUMENT

19:58.822 --> 20:00.866
ON HIS UPPER SPINE.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.367
THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL
IS THE ISSUE.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.410
YOU JUST WANT TO DO,
LIKE, THE TOP PART.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.412
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO IT
LIKE I JUST HAVE

20:05.495 --> 20:07.456
SOME RANDOM BUILDING
ON MY BACK.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.625
- THIS IS THE LAST THING
I NEED

20:09.708 --> 20:12.586
WHEN I'M GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH JOSH.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.639
- ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO YOUR CANVAS' SPINE,

20:23.722 --> 20:26.808
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS...

20:26.892 --> 20:27.643
NOW.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.603
- AH!
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.855
{\an8}- SPINE TATTOOS REQUIRE FINESSE
FOR THE SIMPLE FACT

20:31.939 --> 20:34.274
{\an8}THAT YOU HAVE TO LINE UP
THE TATTOO PERFECTLY

20:34.358 --> 20:36.485
{\an8}ON THE SPINE TO FIT THE BODY,
AND THEY'RE VERY PAINFUL.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.446
- OKAY, THIS BOTTOM SECTION,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE,

20:39.529 --> 20:41.865
'CAUSE YOUR SPINE'S
A LITTLE BIT OFF.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.076
- TODAY I'M LOOKING
FOR A STRAIGHT-UP BATTLE.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.369
- YEAH, MAN.
LOOKS GOOD.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.829
- I'M LOOKING FOR EVERYBODY
TO PUT UP A FIGHT

20:47.913 --> 20:48.997
AND TRY TO STAY
IN THIS COMPETITION.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.334
- YOUR JOB IS TO SIT STILL,
RELAX,

20:52.417 --> 20:52.793
ENJOY THE RIDE.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.962
- LET'S DO IT.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.341
- READY TO ROCK IT OUT.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.218
{\an8}LAST TIME I COMPETED, THE JUDGES
MADE THE WRONG DECISION.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.553
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED,

21:03.637 --> 21:05.639
AND I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.432
- IT WILL BE OVER MY DEAD BODY

21:07.516 --> 21:09.559
THAT I CAN KEEP SOMEBODY
THAT CAN'T DRAW.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.854
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.273
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE GONNA
SEND SOMEBODY HOME

21:15.357 --> 21:20.278
THAT HASN'T MADE A TECHNICAL
MISTAKE, NOT [bleep] ONE.

21:20.362 --> 21:24.408
I HAVE WORKED SO HARD
TO COME HERE TO CLAIM MY TITLE

21:24.491 --> 21:25.617
AS INK MASTER.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.202
- YOU HAVE GENTLE HANDS.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.996
I'M HOPING THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
ANOTHER GUY SAID THAT TO YOU.

21:29.079 --> 21:29.997
- HA-HA.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.039
ONLY PEOPLE I TATTOO.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.124
I'M THE FRONT-RUNNER.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.627
I AM THE PERSON TO BEAT.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.962
- WHAT'S UP, JASE?

21:37.045 --> 21:39.715
{\an8}- MY CANVAS' BACK
HAS SUCH A DEEP CONCAVE IN IT,

21:39.798 --> 21:41.883
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY
I'M TATTOOING IN THERE...

21:41.967 --> 21:43.552
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.302
- IF I WOULD HAVE
PUT THIS BUILDING ANY LOWER,

21:44.386 --> 21:46.221
IT WAS GONNA LOOK REALLY WEIRD.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.931
SO WE DECIDED TO PUT IT UP HERE

21:48.015 --> 21:48.598
WHERE IT'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE FLAT.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.392
AND JUST SHOOT THAT NEEDLE

21:50.475 --> 21:52.769
RIGHT UP THROUGH THE TOP
OF HIS OTHER TATTOO.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.271
I KNOW IT'S NOT GREAT PLACEMENT.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.690
I KNOW I'M GONNA
GET COUNTED DOWN FOR IT.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.233
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE I HAD.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.571
I AM STRESSED OUT TO THE MAX
OVER THIS TATTOO.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.072
- FIVE HOURS REMAINING.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.199
- AH.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.409
- HANG IN THERE.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.744
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU NERVOUS?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.078
- NO. ARE YOU?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.330
- [scoffs]

22:12.414 --> 22:14.416
- GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH CRIS IS A JOKE.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.084
{\an8}I COULD TATTOO BLINDFOLDED
AND STILL BEAT THIS GUY.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.130
{\an8}[sighs]
KIDS THESE DAYS, MAN.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.548
{\an8}- I THINK
IT'S A PRETTY FAIR FIGHT.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.925
{\an8}IT'S JUST GONNA COME DOWN
TO WHO TATTOOS BETTER.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.927
{\an8}IF I BEAT ERIK
IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPETITION,

22:26.011 --> 22:27.220
{\an8}THAT'S GONNA SOLIDIFY
THAT I'M A BETTER ARTIST.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.765
THIS IS THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.058
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING
ALL THE WAY UP.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.350
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- TORE UP.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.228
- OH, MAN.
WHAT ABOUT TIME, BUD?

22:35.312 --> 22:36.646
- WHAT ABOUT TIME?

22:36.730 --> 22:38.523
{\an8}- THERE'S JUST A LOT OF FLAWS
STICKING OUT IN THIS TATTOO.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.277
THE PROPORTION AND DEPTH
AND ANATOMY LOOK AWKWARD.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.863
DON COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.073
HOW Y'ALL DOING OVER HERE?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.115
- WHEN SHE STANDS UP, THIS
KIND OF CURVES A LITTLE BIT,

22:47.199 --> 22:49.618
BUT IT SITS RIGHT ON HER BONES.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.702
- WOW.
- SAME WITH HERE.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.162
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA
HANDLE THIS SECTION?

22:52.245 --> 22:54.039
- I'M GONNA MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE IT'S CLOSER TO THE SKIN

22:54.122 --> 22:56.500
HERE AND HERE, AND THEN HERE
IT'S KIND OF DISAPPEARING.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.086
{\an8}I JUST DON'T THINK THAT DON
IS AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT I AM.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.296
HE NEEDS TO GO HOME ALREADY,
SO I CAN DO WHAT I NEED TO DO

23:01.379 --> 23:03.465
AND FOCUS ON THE REST
OF THE COMPETITORS.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.800
- THREE HOURS TO GO, EVERYBODY.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.343
THREE MORE HOURS.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.636
- WE'RE GETTING THERE.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.680
IT'S JUST ALL THESE WINDOWS,
MAN, HOLY [bleep].

23:10.764 --> 23:13.975
- OOH!

23:14.059 --> 23:16.061
- MY CANVAS AT THIS POINT
IS IN SO MUCH PAIN.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.855
{\an8}THIS DUDE IS FREAKING OUT.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.273
THAT MEANS WE GOT TO STOP.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.067
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS WHEN YOU
START SHAKING LIKE THAT?

23:22.150 --> 23:23.401
THAT MEANS ADRENALINE SHOCK.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.988
THIS IS INSANE
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.782
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.118
I CAN'T CONTROL THAT TWITCHING.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.619
- LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.830
YOU CAN DO THIS.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.665
- OH.
[groans]

23:36.748 --> 23:39.000
- IF MY CANVAS TAPS OUT ON ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TATTOO,

23:39.084 --> 23:42.462
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.464
- ONE HOUR REMAINING.
- UGH. YOU SUCK.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.716
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY
WE'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.343
BUT WE'RE DOING REAL GOOD.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.637
- ALWAYS FUN
WHEN YOU HAVE SUNBURN.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.848
THEN THE SKIN
GETS IN MY NEEDLE.

23:52.931 --> 23:53.849
I GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT
ALL THE TIME.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.600
I'M ON THE BEACH.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.518
{\an8}MY CANVAS WANTS
A POLYNESIAN HAWK

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
{\an8}GOING SHOULDER BLADE
TO SHOULDER BLADE.

23:58.395 --> 23:58.895
ALL THE SURFER BROTHERS
WANT THAT STUFF,

23:58.979 --> 23:59.980
AND I DO A LOT OF IT.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.982
I'M STOKED.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.859
I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR 20 YEARS.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.277
I'M ANYTHING BUT SLOW.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.361
[exhales sharply]

24:06.444 --> 24:08.113
NOBODY CAN TAKE OUT
THE FUNKY LONGNECK.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.197
I'M BACK.

24:09.281 --> 24:13.368
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

24:13.451 --> 24:15.370
SIX, FIVE,

24:15.453 --> 24:17.372
FOUR, THREE,

24:17.455 --> 24:19.291
TWO, ONE.

24:19.374 --> 24:19.875
THAT'S IT.
TIME IS UP.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.001
MACHINES DOWN.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.794
NO MORE TATTOOING.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.212
- OH, MY GOD.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.466
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.051
- INCREDIBLE.
- COOL.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.261
- THAT'S SICK, MAN.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.054
- JASON, THIS TATTOO SUCKS.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.390
THE LINES ARE CROOKED,

24:35.473 --> 24:38.268
AND TO PUT THE SPIRE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LETTER

24:38.351 --> 24:40.395
WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU'VE MADE

24:40.478 --> 24:42.063
THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.816
IT'S JUST A FAIL.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.570
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

24:48.653 --> 24:49.946
- I'M JUST GETTING MADDER
AND MADDER.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.239
IF YOU GO INTO A COMPETITION

24:51.323 --> 24:52.574
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES
SET FORTH,

24:52.657 --> 24:53.867
IF ONE PERSON BREAKS THEM,

24:53.950 --> 24:55.410
THAT ONE PERSON
SHOULD BE PENALIZED.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.495
AND IN THIS CASE,
I BELIEVE IT'S JOSH.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.873
- THERE'S NO REALM IN
THIS UNIVERSE THAT THIS IS OKAY,

24:59.956 --> 25:03.543
THAT WE SHOULD JUST ALL PLAY
THIS FAIR, HONORABLE COMPETITION

25:03.627 --> 25:04.419
WITH SOMEONE THAT HAS NO REGARD
FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

25:04.502 --> 25:07.047
- JOSH HAS BEEN BUSTED
FOR SMOKING WEED

25:07.130 --> 25:08.256
TO HANDLE HIS ANXIETY.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.591
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE PRESSURE,

25:09.674 --> 25:11.134
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
IN A COMPETITION.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.677
- YOU DON'T BRING [bleep] HERE
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.679
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S AGAINST
THE COMPETITION GUIDELINES.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.473
- HE JUST RUINED HIMSELF.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.725
- I CAN'T STAND BY ANYTHING
HE'S DONE.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.268
I CAN'T DO IT.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.270
- I'M JUST HAPPY I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT FEELS THIS WAY.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.023
- ALL OF US HAVE BEEN STRESSED,
AND ALL OF US HAVE ANXIETY.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.983
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.069
- IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN JUST SUPER DISRESPECTFUL.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.153
- YEAH, IT'S JUST--
- IT DEMEANS EVERYBODY'S--

25:30.237 --> 25:31.071
- IT'S JUST HAVING RESPECT
FOR YOUR COMPETITORS.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.490
- EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.450
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT
JOSH IS SMOKING OR NOT SMOKING.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.868
THAT'S HIS PERSONAL PREFERENCE.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.455
BUT IN THIS COMPETITION,
YOU DON'T BREAK RULES, PERIOD.

25:40.538 --> 25:44.584
IF HE'S SMART,
HE'S PACKING UP.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.877
{\an8}- YOU'RE A [bleep] LIAR.

25:45.961 --> 25:46.920
{\an8}YOU'RE A [bleep] CHEAT.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.213
{\an8}PUNK BITCH.
- IT'S INSANE.

25:48.296 --> 25:51.174
- IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT
OF A DISEASE MEDICAL JOURNAL.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.342
- IT'S JUST GONNA
GET TOUGHER AND TOUGHER.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.761
- EXCUSE ME.
CAN I SPEAK?

26:05.021 --> 26:06.273
- EVERYBODY'S GOT A PROBLEM.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.359
JOSH HAS BEEN SMOKING POT,
CHEATING IN THE COMPETITION.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.485
- HE BASICALLY JUST
GAVE US THE FINGER.

26:10.568 --> 26:11.611
- THE BEST THING HE COULD EVER
DO IS JUST OWN UP TO IT

26:11.695 --> 26:14.364
AND JUST BE LIKE,
"YEAH, I DID IT. I [bleep] UP."

26:14.447 --> 26:17.784
- I MEAN, I'M BEYOND PISSED,
AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT--

26:17.867 --> 26:19.160
- I WOULD LOVE TO BE PART
OF THIS CONVERSATION,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.162
SINCE IT'S ABOUT ME.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.206
- BASICALLY, EVERYBODY
FEELS KIND OF CHEATED.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.875
- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,
I DIDN'T KNOW

26:25.959 --> 26:27.002
THAT IT WOULD BE
SUCH A BIG DEAL.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.336
- OKAY.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.504
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
ANYBODY WOULD FEEL THAT.

26:29.587 --> 26:32.007
- I'M ACTUALLY FLABBERGASTED
THAT YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.591
STOP BEING A DUMBASS.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.344
I WANT TO BEAT OUT MY RIVAL
IN A FAIR FIGHT.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.179
{\an8}I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GONNA
BATTLE WITH SOMEBODY

26:38.263 --> 26:39.681
{\an8}WHO'S NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.850
YOU'RE A [bleep] LIAR.
YOU'RE A [bleep] CHEAT.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.853
BE A MAN AND OWN YOUR [bleep]
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.355
AT LEAST YOU CAN DO THAT.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.606
- DUDE, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.569
- I CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.571
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP,
AND I NEVER DID.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.865
- I HELPED YOU BY NOT BEATING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD INTO THE WALL.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.366
THAT'S HOW I HELPED YOU OUT.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.493
PUNK BITCH.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.208
- I DIDN'T DO IT
TO HURT ANYBODY.

27:07.292 --> 27:07.834
I DIDN'T GET AN ADVANTAGE
FROM IT.

27:07.917 --> 27:08.710
I'M STANDING MY GROUND.

27:08.793 --> 27:09.878
I STILL WANT TO CONTINUE
TO COMPETE.

27:09.961 --> 27:13.256
I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT
TO BE HERE WITH MY TATTOOS.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.091
I'VE BUSTED MY ASS.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.735
- TODAY YOU HAD TO SHOW FINESSE

27:33.818 --> 27:39.199
BY TATTOOING ON A DIFFICULT
BODY PART, THE SPINE.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.452
ERIK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.120
YOU HANDED OUT THE SKULLS.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.081
YOU SELECTED TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH DON.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.749
- I JUST DECIDED
THAT SINCE WE'RE RIVALS,

27:47.832 --> 27:48.583
WE SHOULD REALLY GO UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.251
- WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN
OF ATTACK HERE

27:50.335 --> 27:52.754
IN TERMS OF SHOWING FINESSE?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.464
- I ACTUALLY READ THE DEFINITION
OF FINESSE.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.298
IT SAID,
"INTRICATE AND DELICATE."

27:55.382 --> 27:58.093
SO I JUST FELT EVERY VERTEBRAE

27:58.176 --> 27:59.928
TO FEEL
WHERE THE PROTRUSIONS WERE.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.638
THAT'S WHY THERE'S
A SLIGHT CURVE IN THE BOTTOM.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.140
- TO GO ALONG HER ACTUAL SPINE,

28:04.224 --> 28:06.851
THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING EXAMPLE
OF FINESSE.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.061
- I ALSO LIKE THE FACT

28:08.144 --> 28:10.647
THAT YOU WERE MINDFUL
OF THE CURVE OF THE SPINE,

28:10.730 --> 28:12.565
SO THE TOP'S LIGHTER.
THE BOTTOM'S DARKER.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.443
OVERALL, MAN, IT'S A NICE JOB.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.781
- DON.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.034
- THE BOTTOM OF THE SPINE
IS DEFINITELY OFF CENTER.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.702
IT'S DEAD-ON
IN THE TOP VERTEBRAS.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.995
IN THE BOTTOM, IT VEERS OFF.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.289
- THE MAIN THING THAT
WEIRDS ME OUT ABOUT THIS TATTOO

28:28.373 --> 28:30.458
IS THE WEIRD BLOOD DOTS.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.377
BECAUSE YOUR CLIENT'S SO FRECKLY

28:32.460 --> 28:34.337
AND YOU DID
ALL OF THOSE RED DOTS,

28:34.421 --> 28:36.589
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT
OF A DISEASE MEDICAL JOURNAL.

28:36.673 --> 28:40.593
THAT'S WHERE YOU LOST ME
ON THIS DESIGN.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.846
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S POLL THE JUDGES

28:42.929 --> 28:43.888
IN THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD
COMPETITION.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.183
{\an8}- BOTH OF YOU DID GREAT EXAMPLES
OF SOFT SHADING.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.853
{\an8}OVERALL, ERIK'S IS
JUST A LITTLE MORE SMOOTH

28:49.936 --> 28:52.939
{\an8}IN THE SOFT AREAS,
SO I'M GONNA GO WITH ERIK.

28:53.022 --> 28:53.565
- I'M GONNA GO WITH ERIK.
- ERIK.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.608
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.026
- THANK YOU.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.903
- MARK.

28:58.987 --> 29:02.115
HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING
TEAMED UP AGAINST AARON?

29:02.198 --> 29:03.908
- WELL, I KNOW HE'S REALLY
A GOOD TATTOO ARTIST,

29:03.992 --> 29:05.118
SO I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE
A GOOD CHALLENGE.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.955
- HE DID SHOW FINESSE BY TAKING
THE OLD IMAGE OF THE SUN

29:09.038 --> 29:11.207
AND INCORPORATING THE LIGHT RAYS
TO THE BIRD.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.083
IT WASN'T SENSELESS BACKGROUND;

29:12.167 --> 29:14.419
IT ACTUALLY HAD MEANING
BEHIND IT.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.795
- MY MAIN PROBLEM
WITH THE TATTOO IS,

29:15.879 --> 29:18.548
THE TAIL FEATHERS HAVE
THAT SEPARATION FROM THE BODY.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.383
IF YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE THAT HALO GAP,

29:20.467 --> 29:22.385
IT SHOULD BE EQUIDISTANT
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.095
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO BE PRECISE,

29:24.179 --> 29:27.015
AND THAT WOULD HAVE SHOWN
A LITTLE MORE FINESSE.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.518
- AARON.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.061
- VERY CLEAN.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.354
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
A LOT OF FINESSE IN THIS.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.608
THE LITTLE REPETITIVE SHAPES
THAT COME DOWN WITH THE SHADING

29:36.691 --> 29:38.109
THAT COME OFF OF THEM
ARE VERY NICE.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.903
THE BLACK IS SOLID.
THE LINES ARE CRISP.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.279
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB

29:41.362 --> 29:43.865
MAKING THIS THING LOOK
EQUALLY SMOOTH ALL ACROSS.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.033
- YOU'VE HAD
SOME ROUGH CRITIQUES RECENTLY.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.869
AT LEAST YOU'RE BACK FIRING
WITH A CLEAN OUTLINE.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.496
- I'M GETTING INTO STUFF
THAT I'M ENJOYING,

29:49.579 --> 29:50.872
AND I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME
DOING IT.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.707
- MUCH BETTER FOR YOU.
WELCOME BACK.

29:52.790 --> 29:53.875
- THANK YOU.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.378
- WHO HAD THE BETTER TATTOO,
AARON OR MARK?

29:57.462 --> 30:00.381
{\an8}- JUST THE FACT THAT
AARON'S OUTLINE IS MORE CRISP,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.050
{\an8}I THINK IT SHOWS
A LITTLE MORE FINESSE.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.885
AARON.
I'M GOING WITH AARON.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.970
- I'M GONNA GO WITH AARON
AS WELL.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.805
CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.
- THANK YOU.

30:07.889 --> 30:12.268
- CLEEN, YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST CRIS.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.396
- THIS IS A REALLY SHARP,
VIBRANT, DYNAMIC TATTOO, MAN.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.731
THE COLOR CONTRAST IS GREAT.

30:16.814 --> 30:19.275
THE DEPTH THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO
ACHIEVE WITH THAT DARK SHADING

30:19.359 --> 30:20.527
AND THE WAY THE SPIRALS
GO UNDERNEATH EACH OTHER

30:20.610 --> 30:22.695
REALLY MAKES IT STAND APART.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.947
- THANK YOU.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.741
- LINING THINGS UP
IN THE CENTER OF ANYBODY'S SPINE

30:26.824 --> 30:29.702
IS VERY TOUGH, AND BY DOING
THIS STYLIZED VERSION OF IT,

30:29.786 --> 30:32.080
YOU SET YOURSELF UP
NEVER TO FAIL.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.457
CHOICES ARE
WHAT WIN THIS COMPETITION,

30:34.541 --> 30:36.334
AND YOU'RE MAKING GOOD ONES.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.923
- CRIS.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.259
- THERE'S A LOT
OF UNEVEN LINES IN THIS TATTOO.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.011
ALL THESE LITTLE BARS
THAT GO ACROSS ARE NOT PARALLEL,

30:47.095 --> 30:48.721
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF INCONSISTENCIES.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.432
THE BOTTOM SPIRAL
IS JUST OUT OF WHACK.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.433
IT'S LIKE,
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.352
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
THE BOTTOM HALF LOOK

30:54.435 --> 30:55.770
LIKE IT WAS BREAKING APART.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.772
- BUT IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY BE BROKEN

30:57.855 --> 31:00.149
AND HAVE SOME OF THESE BARS
FALLING OFF OF THE BOTTOM,

31:00.233 --> 31:02.819
THEN SOMEBODY WOULD BE ABLE
TO SAY IT'S FALLING APART.

31:02.902 --> 31:06.823
BUT INSTEAD IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
YOU MESSED IT UP IN THE DESIGN.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.575
- BETWEEN CLEEN AND CRIS,
WHO HAD THE BETTER TATTOO?

31:08.658 --> 31:10.785
- CLEEN'S THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.

31:10.868 --> 31:11.327
- CLEEN.
- CLEEN.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.831
- CONGRATULATIONS.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.291
JASON.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.418
YOU WENT UP AGAINST JOSH.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.337
AS FAR AS THE EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING ITSELF GOES,

31:21.421 --> 31:23.881
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS CLOSE
OF AN IMAGE OF IT,

31:23.965 --> 31:26.467
THOSE LINES
HAVE TO BE EXACTLY PARALLEL

31:26.551 --> 31:29.053
IN ORDER
TO REALLY CREATE THAT STRUCTURE.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.346
AND AT THE TOP OF THIS THING,

31:30.430 --> 31:31.264
BEFORE YOU GET TO THAT NEEDLE,

31:31.347 --> 31:33.308
THOSE LINES
ARE A LITTLE BIT WOBBLY.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.685
- PUTTING THE NEEDLE THROUGH
THE LETTER WAS A BAD IDEA.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.854
HIS NAME HAS GOT TO BE
MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM

31:37.937 --> 31:39.147
THAN THIS NEEDLE,

31:39.230 --> 31:40.940
AND YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE
THE SHAPE OF THAT LETTER.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.233
- THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTIONS.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.401
MY INTENTIONS WERE
TO NOT BLOW UP THAT BUILDING

31:43.484 --> 31:45.445
SO DAMN BIG, THOUGH.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.487
- ANY WHICH WAY
YOUR INTENTIONS WERE,

31:46.571 --> 31:49.449
IT CHANGED THE "I"
TO ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.950
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE SHAPE
OF SOMEBODY'S LETTER

31:51.034 --> 31:52.243
OF THEIR TATTOO,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.745
- I CAN'T RESTRUCTURE A BUILDING
EITHER, CHRIS.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.663
IF YOU WOULD HAVE PUT THAT THING
ANY LOWER WITH THE CONCAVE

31:55.747 --> 31:56.914
OF HIS BACK...
- I UNDERSTAND.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.249
- THEN YOUR BUILDING
WOULD HAVE WENT LIKE THAT.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.751
- I DON'T THINK
THERE'S THAT MANY TATTOOERS

31:59.834 --> 32:01.836
IN THE BUILDING THAT WOULD HAVE
A RUN A NEEDLE THROUGH A LETTER,

32:01.919 --> 32:04.964
AND EVERYBODY BEHIND YOU
IS SHAKING THEIR HEAD NO.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.010
- JOSH.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.514
YOU WERE DEALT THE SAME HAND
AS JASON WAS.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.850
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN HERE?

32:15.933 --> 32:17.894
- HE'S A HUGE DUDE, AND BECAUSE
OF THE SIZE OF HIS BACK

32:17.977 --> 32:19.270
AND BECAUSE OF THE CONCAVE,
I HAD TO DO

32:19.354 --> 32:21.147
A LOT OF STRAIGHTENING OF LINES
WHILE I WAS TATTOOING.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.191
- OBVIOUSLY, THESE LONG LINES
ON THIS CURVATURE

32:23.274 --> 32:25.985
OF THE BODY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE SOME WARPED AREAS,

32:26.069 --> 32:27.654
BUT OVERALL, IT'S VERY CLEAN.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.155
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A STRONG TATTOO.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.282
IT REALLY DOES HAVE
A STRIKING IMAGE.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.451
IT'S BOLD.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.787
- THIS WAS THE HARDEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY, BY FAR,

32:35.870 --> 32:39.916
AND I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB
FOR WHAT YOU WERE GIVEN.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.044
- TIME TO POLL THE JUDGES.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.545
BETWEEN JOSH AND JASON.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.546
{\an8}- IT'S A CLEAR-CUT DECISION
HERE.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.006
{\an8}I MEAN, ONE OF THEM STANDS OUT

32:47.090 --> 32:49.676
{\an8}AND LOOKS STRONG
AND TECHNICALLY PRECISE,

32:49.759 --> 32:50.426
{\an8}AND ANOTHER ONE HAS
A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN IT.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.387
GO WITH JOSH.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.221
- I'M GONNA GO WITH JOSH
AS WELL.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.348
- JOSH.
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

32:55.431 --> 32:56.891
- THANK YOU.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.560
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I--CAN I SPEAK?

32:59.644 --> 33:01.312
I WAS CONFRONTED
BY MY FELLOW ARTISTS

33:01.396 --> 33:03.231
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN
DOING SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.607
IT IS A BREACH OF THE RULES.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.733
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.235
- I MEAN, IF I SIGN A CONTRACT

33:07.318 --> 33:09.737
STATING I COULDN'T DRINK COFFEE
WHILE I WAS HERE, WELL, THEN,

33:09.821 --> 33:10.988
I'D BE DAMNED
IF I'M EVEN GONNA HAVE A SIP

33:11.072 --> 33:13.741
'CAUSE THAT'S THE [bleep] RULES,
BOTTOM LINE.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.993
- I HAD NO INTENTION OF
DISRESPECTING THIS COMPETITION.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.537
IF THERE IS ANY WAY
THAT THE PEOPLE

33:17.620 --> 33:18.996
THAT I'M COMPETING AGAINST
COULD LOOK PAST IT

33:19.080 --> 33:21.582
AND FORGIVE ME
AND LET ME CONTINUE TO COMPETE--

33:21.666 --> 33:23.793
- THIS IS NOTHING TO DO
ON THIS SIDE.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.378
WE LITERALLY LOOK AT TATTOOS.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.130
WHATEVER COMES DOWN
COMES DOWN.

33:27.213 --> 33:27.922
THAT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.

33:28.005 --> 33:30.633
- I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.927
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.221
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.683
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:38.766 --> 33:39.726
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.353
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.321
- I JUST REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M TRULY SORRY,

33:52.405 --> 33:53.948
AND I DID NOT INTEND
TO BE UNFAIR.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.533
- AND I'M NOT FALLING
FOR ANY OF THAT [bleep].

33:55.616 --> 33:57.118
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THIS SITUATION.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.286
- YOU DID THIS TO YOURSELF.
- I REALIZE THAT.

33:58.369 --> 34:01.956
- THE SITUATION IS,
NOBODY LIKES A LIAR OR A CHEAT.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.040
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
I STOOD UP TODAY

34:03.124 --> 34:03.875
AND PUT IT OUT ON THE TABLE.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.669
- LOOK, OUT OF RESPECT
FOR ALL OF US,

34:06.753 --> 34:08.795
YOU SHOULD JUST PACK YOUR
[bleep] AND GET THE [bleep] OUT.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.965
- I DO HOPE THEY CAN COME UP
WITH A CONSEQUENCE.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.507
- WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE
GONNA BE?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.135
"OH, YOU DON'T GET ANY ICE CREAM
BEFORE BED."

34:14.217 --> 34:16.596
- I DON'T CARE, I JUST WANT
TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.139
I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE
TO COMPETE.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.975
- YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT,
PAY THE [bleep] PIPER

34:21.058 --> 34:22.851
AND GO HOME.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.023
- ARE YOU GOING
TO PACK YOUR STUFF?

34:27.106 --> 34:27.648
- GOOD.
GO PACK YOUR [bleep].

34:27.732 --> 34:29.650
HE CHEATED EVERYBODY.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.235
- IT'S JUST DISGRACEFUL.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.456
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY WE'RE TESTING
FINESSE WITH SPINE TATTOOS.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.831
THE ARTISTS WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.292
- THE BOTTOM FOUR
ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES,

34:46.375 --> 34:47.001
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.127
- LET'S START OFF WITH DON.

34:48.210 --> 34:52.172
- WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE'S
SMOOTH APPLICATIONS,

34:52.255 --> 34:54.175
DON DEFINITELY
HAS SOME OF THE ROUGHEST.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.967
- IT REALLY IS OFF CENTER.

34:56.052 --> 34:59.222
- THE BOTTOM OF THE DESIGN
COCKS TO THE LEFT.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.515
- NEXT UP WE HAVE MARK.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.683
- TECHNICALLY, MAN,
THIS BLACK IS ROUGH.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.727
THE LINE WORK
IS DEFINITELY NOT SMOOTH.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.896
- THE INCONSISTENCIES
THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN

35:06.979 --> 35:09.565
REALLY SHOW A LACK OF FINESSE.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.942
- CRIS.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.444
- THIS TATTOO DID NOT HAVE
TO LOOK THIS OVERWORKED.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.364
HE SHADED THE OUTSIDE JUST
AS DARK AS HE DID THE INSIDE.

35:16.447 --> 35:17.865
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID
AT THE BOTTOM DOWN THERE,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.992
BUT THAT LAST TWIST
IS OUT OF WHACK.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.704
- JASON, NO TWO LINES
ARE PARALLEL.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.790
- JASON IS NOT THE TECHNICIAN

35:25.873 --> 35:26.916
FOR THIS PARTICULAR STYLE JOB.

35:26.999 --> 35:30.378
- HIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL
IS NOT THERE.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.462
IT'S INSANE.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.547
- IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING
TO SEE

35:32.630 --> 35:34.173
HOW THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTES.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.383
I THINK WE'RE DECIDED.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.510
- YEAH.

35:37.593 --> 35:40.304
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.558
- THAT TATTOO'S MINE,
AND MY ARTIST WAS JASON.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.226
- SOME OF THE LINES
ON THE WINDOWS ARE CROOKED.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.894
- IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT SYMMETRICAL.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.396
THE SHADOW IS OFF
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.232
THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN
THE SHADOW AND THE BUILDING.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.567
AND THEN
LOOK AT ON THE LEFT SIDE

35:52.650 --> 35:54.360
HOW THE SHADOW'S RIGHT UP
AGAINST THE BUILDING.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.738
- HIS LINES ARE
A LITTLE BIT SHAKY.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.031
- THAT ONE'S MY TATTOO.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.700
MY ARTIST WAS MARK.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.577
- YOUR EYES GET DRAWN RIGHT
TO THE FLAWS OF THE WINGS.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.953
THE WINGS ARE GOING
THROUGH THE CLOUDS,

36:04.036 --> 36:05.580
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MATCH UP
ON EITHER SIDE.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.081
- YEAH, IT'S NOT COHESIVE
THROUGHOUT THE--

36:07.164 --> 36:08.291
- YEAH, IT'S SO NOT.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.250
- THE SYMMETRY IS REALLY
BOTHERING ME ON THIS ONE.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.461
- I JUST WISH
HE DID A STRAIGHT TRIBAL

36:12.545 --> 36:16.674
WITH CLOUDS BEHIND THE HAWK.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.092
- THIS IS CRIS' TATTOO.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.094
- THE MOLECULES
LOOK LIKE TAPEWORMS.

36:20.177 --> 36:21.178
- I THINK IT LOOKS WARPED,

36:21.262 --> 36:22.722
LIKE SOME OF THE PIECES
ARE STRETCHED OUT.

36:22.805 --> 36:23.639
- I DON'T LIKE THE DESIGN.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.683
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.767
- GIVING CRIS 100 GRAND
AFTER THIS?

36:26.851 --> 36:29.770
THERE'S NO WAY.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.190
- DO WE ALL AGREE?
all: YES.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.617
- ALL RIGHT, THE JUDGES WANT
TO SEE EVERYONE BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.871
- WELL, [bleep].

36:46.954 --> 36:48.205
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WE'RE ALL GOING DOWN.

36:59.759 --> 37:03.221
- TODAY YOU FACED OFF
TATTOOING YOUR CANVASES' SPINES.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.473
CRIS, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

37:05.556 --> 37:10.728
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.271
- I DIDN'T THINK THE CANVAS JURY
WOULD HAVE PICKED ME.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.148
- YOU CONTINUALLY
STILL MAKE CHOICES

37:14.231 --> 37:15.024
THAT ARE SETTING YOURSELF UP
FOR FAILURE.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.151
- IT WAS JUST
A POOR DESIGN CHOICE,

37:17.234 --> 37:18.110
AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT.

37:18.194 --> 37:21.030
I CAN COMPETE
WITH THE TOP GUYS HERE.

37:21.113 --> 37:24.742
- YOU DEFINITELY NEED A WIN,
MAN.

37:24.825 --> 37:25.826
- DON.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.704
- THERE ARE OBVIOUS SHORTCOMINGS
IN THIS TATTOO.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.914
- I'M A TERRIBLE LOSER.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.749
AND, I MEAN, I WAS PRETTY UPSET
WITH THE DECISION.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.084
- IN THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD
CHALLENGE,

37:33.167 --> 37:34.961
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON POINT
ON EVERY LITTLE BIT.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.295
- I MEAN,
I WORK BETTER UNDER PRESSURE.

37:36.379 --> 37:40.132
- IT'S JUST GONNA
GET TOUGHER AND TOUGHER.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.926
- MARK.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.344
- HAD YOU HAVE AT LEAST PUT
THAT LITTLE INFERENCE

37:43.427 --> 37:45.388
OF THE RIGHT WING
COMING OFF THE BODY,

37:45.471 --> 37:46.722
IT WOULDN'T HAVE LOOKED
SO OUT OF LINE.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.099
- I JUST REALLY
WANTED TO HAVE THAT WOW FACTOR.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.809
I JUST ALWAYS WANT TO DO
THE BEST TATTOO.

37:49.892 --> 37:50.935
I THINK
IT'S A REALLY COOL DESIGN.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.895
- IT'S ONE STEP AWAY,
AND I KNOW IT'S EASY TO SAY

37:52.979 --> 37:54.146
SITTING FROM THIS SIDE.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.606
- I JUST WENT BALLS TO THE WALL

37:55.690 --> 37:57.692
AND JUST TRIED TO DO
THIS BIG, AWESOME TATTOO.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.026
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.488
IT'S JUST NOT A SAFE PLAY
HERE AT THIS COMPETITION.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.365
- JASON.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.324
- TECHNICALLY, MAN,
YOU'RE NOT STACKING UP.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.867
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PUT THESE TATTOOS IN

38:06.951 --> 38:09.370
AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN

38:09.453 --> 38:12.707
IF YOU EXPECT TO GO TO THE END
OF THIS COMPETITION.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.250
- I FEEL LIKE I LET MYSELF DOWN.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.127
THAT BUGS THE [bleep] OUT OF ME.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.294
- WE KNOW YOU

38:17.378 --> 38:18.546
FROM A PREVIOUS SEASON...
- YES.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.507
- AND WE'VE SEEN YOU GO
FROM HIGHS TO CRASHES.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.759
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
ON A DOWNWARD SLIDE AGAIN.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.387
I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH YOU
GO THROUGH ANOTHER FALLOUT.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.557
- I DON'T WANT TO WATCH ME
GO THROUGH THAT EITHER.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.811
- CRIS, DON, MARK, JASON,

38:33.894 --> 38:39.108
ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD BE JUSTIFIABLY ELIMINATED.

38:39.191 --> 38:45.531
HOWEVER, THERE IS A SITUATION
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.702
JOSH, YOU VIOLATED MULTIPLE
RULES OF THIS COMPETITION,

38:49.785 --> 38:54.206
AND AS YOU ADMITTED, YOU'VE BEEN
IN POSSESSION OF CONTRABAND.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.500
- I JUST WANT TO DO
THE COMPETITION, MAN.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.419
I DIDN'T DO IT TO CHEAT.
I DIDN'T DO IT TO BE UNFAIR.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.255
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL.

39:01.338 --> 39:03.924
- I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR-CUT.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.092
- I [bleep] UP,
AND I MADE A BAD CHOICE.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.054
I-I FEEL LIKE
A [bleep] IDIOT.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.764
- THE CONTRACT THAT YOU SIGNED

39:09.847 --> 39:12.099
WHEN YOU ENTERED
THIS COMPETITION IS VERY CLEAR.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.518
THIS IS
A SERIOUS RULES VIOLATION.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.772
- IF THIS MEANS THAT I'M GOING
HOME, THEN I MADE THAT CHOICE,

39:17.855 --> 39:18.731
AND THAT'S PART OF BEING A MAN,

39:18.814 --> 39:20.775
IS [bleep] STANDING UP
TO YOUR MISTAKES.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.778
- IT IS GROUNDS
FOR IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.239
THEREFORE,
YOU ARE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.285
- THIS IS A MAJOR, MAJOR SHOT.

39:31.368 --> 39:33.954
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT'S YOUR CONTRACT.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.164
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S HANDLED
OUTSIDE OF OUR HANDS.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.958
AND I'M SORRY
YOU'RE LEAVING LIKE THIS,

39:38.042 --> 39:39.543
BUT YOU DID [bleep] YOURSELF.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.128
- WE'RE NOT HERE
TO POLICE THE HOUSE.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.088
WE'RE HERE TO JUDGE TATTOOS.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.423
TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME EVER

39:44.507 --> 39:47.760
THAT THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY GOES HOME,

39:47.843 --> 39:50.012
AND THAT'S YOUR [bleep] FAULT,
JOSH.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.263
- I'M SORRY.

39:51.347 --> 39:55.142
- JOSH, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.318
- IT SUCKS.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.986
I UNDERSTAND
THAT I MADE POOR CHOICES,

40:06.070 --> 40:08.614
AND I DID NOT HIDE
FROM MY MISTAKES.

40:08.697 --> 40:09.824
I HAVE SHOWN

40:09.907 --> 40:12.409
THAT I DO HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO WIN THIS COMPETITION.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.870
THAT'S WHAT [bleep]
PISSES ME OFF.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.499
IN MY MIND, I AM INK MASTER.

40:23.420 --> 40:26.799
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:26.882 --> 40:28.759
- OFF THE FIELD,
HE FIGHTS TIRELESSLY

40:28.843 --> 40:30.845
FOR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS,

40:30.928 --> 40:32.638
RUNNING BACK DEANGELO WILLIAMS.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.140
- YOU'RE EITHER GONNA
SHUT ME UP,

40:34.223 --> 40:36.183
OR YOU'RE GOING
THE [bleep] HOME.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.269
- YOU STILL HEAR ME?
[bleep].

40:38.352 --> 40:39.812
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS
ARE [bleep] UP,

40:39.895 --> 40:40.896
DOING STUPID [bleep].

40:40.980 --> 40:42.606
- EVERYBODY HAS A FAULT.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.899
GET READY FOR YOURS TOO.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.861
- YOUR DRAWING IS NOT UP TO PAR
TO WIN THIS THING.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.279
- THIS TATTOO IS HARD TO READ.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.739
- YOU HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY
IN THE BOTTOM THE WHOLE TIME.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.284
- IT IS NOT FLATTERING.
- IT'S JUST ROUGH.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.077
- HOW CAN YOU BE INK MASTER?
