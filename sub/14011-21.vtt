<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:24.356
Okay, pal, let's go.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.791
Rise and shine.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.226
Coffee at the mission.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.428
Let's go.
Let's go.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.296
Come on.
Up we go.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.100
(<i> horse neighing</i> )

00:35.102 --> 00:37.069
Look at this.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.071
Oh, geez.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.042
What is this?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.476
Shoe shine out call?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.478
They look like my shoes.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.280
Terrific.
Sure, sure.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.481
Just drop them, drop
them, drop them.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.649
Take off.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.452
(<i> scoffs</i> )
What do we got here?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.320
Oh.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.823
Oh, you okay, buddy? Huh?

00:57.825 --> 01:00.192
(<i> groaning</i> )
I must have got mugged.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.096
Good morning,
New York.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.230
Mounted
Post One.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.299
Request immediate EMS.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.368
On a bench off 86th.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.370
Cut about eight inches,
centimeters--

01:11.372 --> 01:13.605
whichever's smaller--
right about here.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.108
But he's all sewn up

01:16.110 --> 01:18.477
and the doc says
real nice work.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.379
So he had an operation.
So what?

01:20.381 --> 01:21.731
What's the beef?

01:21.732 --> 01:23.082
Well, he says his name
is Drew MacDaniel.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.317
Swears he's never been
under the knife,

01:25.319 --> 01:26.652
never even been
in a hospital,

01:26.654 --> 01:27.853
but the doctor says

01:27.855 --> 01:29.288
he has massive
internal bleeding.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.422
They did an ultrasound
or something

01:30.424 --> 01:31.557
before they took
him into surgery.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.225
And?

01:33.227 --> 01:35.461
And somebody cut out his kidney.

01:37.665 --> 01:42.167
Talk about getting
your pocket picked, huh?

02:47.234 --> 02:50.302
¶ ¶

03:07.388 --> 03:10.589
A fresh incision, an I.V. mark,

03:10.591 --> 03:13.392
and blood tests
indicate benzodiazepines--

03:13.394 --> 03:16.828
Hey, I'm no genius, but to me,
that spells operation.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.697
If it weren't for the tie
on the renal vein,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.566
I'd say he did
a pretty good job.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.385
Renal vein?

03:22.386 --> 03:24.203
Yeah, the renal artery
was tied up like a pro,

03:24.205 --> 03:25.671
but the vein must have popped

03:25.673 --> 03:27.272
ten minutes
after they closed him up.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.974
Rookie mistake.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.675
Half hour later, he was
swimming in his own blood.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.344
Listen, a guy just doesn't
forget he had major surgery.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.680
All I'm saying is that
within 24 hours

03:34.682 --> 03:36.949
someone did a chop-chop
and took out a kidney.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.751
Well, he could have
skipped out of post-op

03:39.753 --> 03:40.919
before Accounting
got to him.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.754
Covering up.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.289
You ever been a patient?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.891
It's easier to bust
out of Attica

03:45.893 --> 03:48.894
than to leave a hospital
without paying.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.796
So you're saying
some Dr. Frankenstein

03:50.798 --> 03:52.831
is out there
selling body parts?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.400
Hey, is it possible?

03:55.402 --> 03:58.670
I saw<i> Sweeney Todd</i> three times,
why not?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.806
If you were going
to steal a kidney...

04:00.808 --> 04:03.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:03.293 --> 04:05.777
I'm a resident looking
at Park Avenue dermatology.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.863
You want to talk kidneys?

04:07.864 --> 04:09.948
Martha Kershan, 14th floor--
resident maven.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.883
Reality? Kidney brokers
are pure fiction.

04:11.885 --> 04:16.021
There is no such animal
as a black market for kidneys.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.790
So even if I wanted to,
I couldn't buy a kidney?

04:18.792 --> 04:19.858
It's against the law.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.376
So is jaywalking.

04:21.377 --> 04:22.893
More to the point,
it's not necessary.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.364
We can keep kidney patients
alive on dialysis

04:25.366 --> 04:27.399
until a kidney
becomes available.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.834
Available, how?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.669
Through O.T.N.--

04:30.671 --> 04:31.903
The Organ Transplant Network.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.473
They monitor
all available organs nationwide.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.743
So I want to give up my kidney--

04:37.745 --> 04:38.744
I go to O.T.N...

04:38.746 --> 04:39.945
Not exactly.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.681
Hopefully, you'd
be recently deceased,

04:42.683 --> 04:44.783
since it's also
illegal to sell a kidney.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.785
Hospital notifies O.T.N.
they've got a donor.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.720
How long
does it take

04:48.722 --> 04:49.855
to get one?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.290
Long, sometimes never.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.692
What's the problem--
getting them to match?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.761
No,
rejection hasn't been

04:55.762 --> 04:57.829
a major concern for ten years;
drugs combat it.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.299
For the most part
everything is interchangeable.

05:00.301 --> 05:03.835
So there's no reason
for this to have happened.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.771
Unless the recipient

05:05.773 --> 05:07.839
was highly cytotoxic.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.776
(<i> chuckles</i> )
English please, Doc.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.044
If you're cytotoxic,

05:12.046 --> 05:14.379
you reject tissue
unlike your own.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.048
The drugs don't work.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.884
You'd need a virtually
perfect match.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.387
Drew MacDaniel.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.389
You don't look
like family.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.792
Under the skin, we're all
brothers, Miss Johnson.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.926
212. Good luck.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.928
He's just up from recovery.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.532
Double dose
of every painkiller we got.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.000
High as a kite.

05:35.002 --> 05:40.005
No, Detective,
I never had an operation.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.809
And you were born
with two kidneys, right?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.811
Drafted in '68.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.847
Healthy enough
for a tour in 'Nam.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.017
You always walk through the park
at night, Mr. MacDaniel?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.785
Tuesdays.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.888
I take my six-year-old
to the playground

05:56.890 --> 05:59.424
off 76th and Fifth.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.827
Lives with her mother.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.095
Divorced?

06:03.097 --> 06:04.496
Separated.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.864
I live on Columbus.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.533
I walk home through the park.

06:08.535 --> 06:14.072
Did you get a look
at these... muggers?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.042
Muggers?

06:24.118 --> 06:26.785
I don't remember anything.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.453
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

06:28.455 --> 06:32.424
Are you telling me MacDaniel
was not a random victim?

06:32.426 --> 06:33.925
All right, we've got a
specialist who says,

06:33.927 --> 06:35.594
the only way this
thing makes sense,

06:35.596 --> 06:37.062
is if the recipient
had a condition

06:37.064 --> 06:38.163
that required a match.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.865
And MacDaniel's kidney
fits the bill?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.867
Well, he'd have to be
tested to make sure,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.035
but the problem is,
MacDaniel swears

06:44.037 --> 06:46.004
from now till Sunday,
that he's never been tested.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.608
Grand theft kidney. Terrific.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.809
What about you?
You got any theories?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.511
Devil worship? Alien beings?

06:52.513 --> 06:55.914
(<i> sighs</i> )
A cult wouldn't stitch
the guy back up.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.916
And I imagine there
would be other organs

06:57.918 --> 06:59.484
of more interest
than a kidney.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.853
Had to be for
a transplant.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.955
Had to happen
sooner or later.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.891
What did?

07:05.892 --> 07:07.826
Well, you don't think with
these medical miracles,

07:07.828 --> 07:10.061
they don't set up a whole
new set of problems?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.464
Oh, what are we going to do?
Bury our heads in the sand?

07:12.466 --> 07:15.000
I'm just saying we come
in with all our own parts,

07:15.002 --> 07:16.501
maybe we should
go out the same way.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.036
(<i> scoffs</i> )
Come on, give me a break, Max.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.971
You know how many lives
have been saved

07:19.973 --> 07:21.907
because of organ donations?

07:21.909 --> 07:24.876
I don't see you
standing in line
giving anything away.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.978
I got the sticker
on my license.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.947
Personally, I think
it should be automatic.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.816
Otherwise, they'd just
give you a sticker

07:30.818 --> 07:32.184
that says you
can't use your organs.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.919
My old man
wouldn't be alive today

07:33.921 --> 07:35.153
if he didn't have
a new ticker.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.888
Okay, enough with
the Philosophy 101.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.857
Now, let's say the motive
is transplant.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.026
I got a $64 question.

07:41.028 --> 07:45.197
Who did it
get transplanted<i> into?</i>

07:45.199 --> 07:47.232
Bull's-eye.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.135
I just need to know
if any kidney transplants

07:50.137 --> 07:52.671
took place at your hospital
in the last 72 hours.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.673
Whoa, whoa, I have
been waiting, all right?

07:54.675 --> 07:57.175
No, no, hold on,
don't go, don't go.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.945
Well, okay.
Yeah. Who does
your scheduling?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.880
No!
O.R. scheduling, okay?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.482
No.
Yes, ma'am.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.085
That's right, that's
right, I'm a detective.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.687
That's quite all right.
No, this is not
a crank call, okay?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.490
Well, could you just maybe
find it for me, huh?

08:11.492 --> 08:12.924
Could ya?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.659
Okay, fine. Thank you.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.596
You know, what is
with people these days?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.231
We got five, at least.
We got four.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.633
The one at Saint John's
took place at 3:30.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.870
MacDaniel wasn't even
in the park at that time.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.505
He hadn't been to see
his daughter, either.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.273
Four.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.713
And you can track where
every kidney came from?

08:34.715 --> 08:35.981
Sure, and where it goes.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.983
For example,
this morning in Miami,

08:37.985 --> 08:41.253
a 14-year-old boy died
in a diving accident,

08:41.255 --> 08:42.954
and tomorrow,

08:42.956 --> 08:45.690
a 63-year-old potato
farmer in Boise

08:45.692 --> 08:46.892
will get his kidney.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.293
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Unbelievable.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.693
Not really, it
gets packed in ice.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.229
Federal Express
does the rest.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.931
So, our four...

08:52.933 --> 08:53.965
Let's see.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.234
The transplant
at Manhattan Memorial

08:56.236 --> 08:58.670
came from Saint Jude's
in Boston.

08:58.672 --> 09:02.741
The one in Newark came
from Concord, New Hampshire.

09:02.743 --> 09:08.947
And the one at Gramercy
came from...

09:08.949 --> 09:10.549
Are you sure
you got this right?

09:11.285 --> 09:12.918
Why?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.471
There's no record

09:15.472 --> 09:18.023
of a kidney to Gramercy
in the last three days.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.259
Thank you very much.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.762
Yeah, blood, kidneys, corneas,
it all comes through here.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.764
You were on Tuesday night?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.015
Till 10:00.

09:27.016 --> 09:28.265
You got a record of
a kidney coming in?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.169
Kidney, kidney,
don't leave home without it.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.272
Tuesday...

09:34.274 --> 09:35.740
Yep, there it is.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.276
Kidney came in at 9:32 p.m.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.679
From where?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.747
What, am I supposed
to ask it where it's from?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.749
Delivery guy
drops off a cooler.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.318
Document says it's a kidney.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.220
I mark down the time,
and I send it upstairs.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.355
To whom?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.291
Patient: Merritt, Mary.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.094
Doctor: Reberty, James.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.635
You don't mind if I tape this?

10:03.637 --> 10:06.037
I find it avoids
misunderstandings.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.175
Well, we certainly
wouldn't want any of those.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.810
To get back to your question.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.779
As long as the blood
and tissue samples

10:14.781 --> 10:16.781
are compatible with my patient,

10:16.783 --> 10:20.085
it doesn't much concern me
where the kidney comes from.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.087
So you have no idea
who the donor was?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.755
The paperwork

10:23.757 --> 10:27.692
that accompanies the organ, uh,
only has the donor's vitals.

10:27.694 --> 10:31.029
If you need more, I guess you
got to talk to O.T.N.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.132
Yeah, well, O.T.N. has no record
of ever delivering a kidney

10:34.134 --> 10:36.167
to Gramercy Hospital, so...

10:36.169 --> 10:38.770
When were you
alerted

10:38.772 --> 10:40.705
that a kidney
had become available?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.241
I was dining at Windows.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.076
That was 9:30.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.345
My beeper went off.

10:47.347 --> 10:51.282
I notified my team,
and I notified the patient.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.184
Nothing unusual?

10:53.186 --> 10:55.220
Like a thousand times before.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.255
The operation was a success.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.357
We're monitoring her responses.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.059
You know, my
guess is that

11:01.061 --> 11:03.261
some clerk got caught napping
down at O.T.N.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.031
To err is human.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.799
WOMAN:
Mary Merritt.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.367
LOGAN:
She looks awful.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.702
Is she going to make it?

11:10.704 --> 11:12.237
She was lucky.

11:12.239 --> 11:16.241
I'd say she got that kidney
in just about the nick of time.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.710
Do you think you
can get us an address,

11:18.712 --> 11:20.779
names of relatives,
friends?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.281
Nope.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.817
Actually, Mary Merritt's
not her real name.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.220
It's a code we give
to the big shots

11:29.222 --> 11:32.123
when they come in
for a detox or a tuck.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.291
Or a transplant?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.826
What are you going to do?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.428
Celebs like their privacy.

11:36.430 --> 11:39.464
Once one of the New Kids
came in, tonsils or something

11:39.466 --> 11:42.267
This whole place
turned into a zoo.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.369
So who do we have here?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.204
NURSE:
You got me.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.239
I've never
seen her before.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.241
But she must be big.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.277
Usually, the charts
have their real I.D.s.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.779
This time,nada.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.181
How about insurance?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.783
The whole thing
was paid up front.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.752
A private suite.

12:00.754 --> 12:01.820
Hmm.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.822
Mind if we take a look?

12:03.824 --> 12:04.823
I shouldn't.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.757
Aw, come on.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.891
Just want to see

12:06.893 --> 12:08.760
how the idle rich
recuperate.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.297
(<i> chuckles</i> )

12:12.299 --> 12:14.799
What did you get?

12:17.471 --> 12:19.738
Her lipstick.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.272
(<i> laughing</i> )

12:21.274 --> 12:22.807
CRAGEN:
<i> It's robbery, Mike.</i>

12:22.809 --> 12:24.743
You don't take
other people's property,

12:24.745 --> 12:26.177
even if you do
have a badge.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.846
Hey, she's in I.C.U.--
I don't think

12:27.848 --> 12:29.414
she's going to need her
lipstick for a while.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.783
Look, you got the prints,
just put it back, okay?

12:31.785 --> 12:32.817
Yeah.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.152
You're not going
to believe this.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.787
Our Ms. Merritt had
a drug possession charge

12:35.789 --> 12:36.821
three years ago.

12:36.823 --> 12:37.856
You get a name?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.408
Joanna Woodleigh,

12:39.409 --> 12:40.959
only daughter
of Phillip Woodleigh.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.360
The Woodleigh Building?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.828
The Woodleigh Library,

12:43.830 --> 12:45.530
the Woodleigh Foundation,
the Woodleigh Trust.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.366
Phillip Woodleigh gives away
more money in one year,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.368
than the three of us
will earn in a lifetime.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.971
Which means his daughter
can afford some new lipstick.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.907
Which means she can afford
a new kidney.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.947
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Mary Merritt.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.984
She said she didn't need
<i>that</i> kind of privacy.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.220
She also hated having
her picture in the<i> Post</i>

13:09.222 --> 13:10.555
after her
last operation.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.924
You mean she's had other
transplant attempts?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.527
Two failed,
last time she almost died

13:15.529 --> 13:17.362
during treatment
for the rejection.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.831
That must be difficult.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.199
I'm sorry.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.169
You know, unfortunately,
your daughter's kidney

13:24.171 --> 13:25.570
can't be accounted for.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.205
And this incident in the park
seems to...

13:27.207 --> 13:30.175
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
believe me, I feel for the man,

13:30.177 --> 13:32.210
but what do you want me to do?

13:32.212 --> 13:33.878
I don't know who he is

13:33.880 --> 13:35.980
or what bearing
this has on my daughter.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.349
The kidney
came through the system,

13:38.351 --> 13:41.219
which I thank God for.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.255
A mugging for a human organ?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.924
GREEVEY:
When was the last time

13:45.926 --> 13:49.093
Drew MacDaniel had
a blood test, Doctor?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.896
I did one about four months ago.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.165
What for?

13:54.167 --> 13:58.369
Mr. MacDaniel was the object
of a paternity suit.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.140
I drew blood
for the court-ordered test.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.175
Fatherhood.
That's a big help.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.877
No, no.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.345
It's the same test: H.L.A.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.082
Same as the one
to test kidney tissue?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.151
Yes.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.020
This is from the
kidney that showed up
at Gramercy Hospital.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.889
It's the same blood type
as MacDaniel.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.158
Same as millions of others, too.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.960
Whether the tissue matches,
I couldn't tell you

14:21.962 --> 14:24.195
without comparing
the H.L.A. results.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.631
Who did the lab work?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.166
Lindquist Labs,

14:28.168 --> 14:30.401
2nd Avenue,
across from University Hospital.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.904
They have
an excellent reputation.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.073
We're impressed in advance.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.075
No one knows client results.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.344
The data's identified
by order number only.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.045
You've got to match patient

14:41.047 --> 14:42.380
with test result
at some point!

14:42.382 --> 14:44.415
Only in Billing.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

14:44.417 --> 14:48.052
The account's accessed
once when the order comes in,

14:48.054 --> 14:51.155
once when the result
goes out-- twice.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.958
And how many times was the
MacDaniel's file accessed?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.327
Not more than twice,
I'm sure.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.063
(<i> typing</i> )

14:59.065 --> 15:00.632
(<i> computer beeps</i> )

15:00.634 --> 15:03.101
What's that?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.637
That's a third time.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.339
And the other accounts?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.342
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

15:13.480 --> 15:17.382
They've all been accessed
three times.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.017
By who?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.685
One of my clerks.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.388
A woman named Rosaria Mendez.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.256
But she's gone home.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.460
To an address
you'll be happy to access.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.496
I even go back to it four times

15:31.498 --> 15:33.364
to make sure
everything is right.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.934
Why, because you make
so many mistakes?

15:35.936 --> 15:37.268
I'm a good worker.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.939
I don't know nothing
about people getting hurt.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.041
I'm sure you're a
worker, Rosaria,

15:43.043 --> 15:44.375
but you might have
helped some people

15:44.377 --> 15:47.011
to hurt an
innocent man.

15:49.482 --> 15:53.718
<i> Entra para dentro.</i>
<i> Entra para dentro.</i>

15:53.720 --> 15:55.453
This nurse came
from the hospital.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.256
She asked for printouts
of test data.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.457
What hospital?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.092
Who's the nurse?

16:01.094 --> 16:02.293
Gramercy Hospital.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.395
Her name is Elaine Hale.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.965
They're doing
this big research project

16:06.967 --> 16:08.199
on kidney transplants.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.269
I thought I was doing good.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.171
You never wondered
why she came to you

16:13.173 --> 16:15.006
instead of the head of the lab?

16:15.008 --> 16:17.275
They were in a hurry.

16:17.277 --> 16:21.212
And your heart was so pure,
you never took money.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.217
GREEVEY:
You work for Dr. Reberty,
don't you?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.752
Everybody here works for him.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.154
He's chief
of transplant surgery.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.389
Does everyone go around town

16:31.391 --> 16:34.125
bribing clerks for
confidential medical data?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.127
That sounds
like an accusation.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.096
It is.
It's a crock.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.298
LOGAN:
Not according
to Rosaria Mendez.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.202
That's just circumventing
the bureaucracy.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.536
Oh, really?
And why would you do that?

16:45.538 --> 16:47.005
To save time.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.740
Everybody does it.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.141
They do?

16:50.143 --> 16:52.543
Why all the interest
in Drew MacDaniel?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.212
Who?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.148
He's a guy...
with a missing kidney.

16:57.150 --> 17:01.052
A guy whose blood-test
results you had.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.188
I got 4,000 sets of results.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.292
If his name is on it,
it sounds like coincidence.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.294
Sorry, guys.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.799
(<i> chuckles</i> )

17:18.438 --> 17:23.207
Look, in ten years,
we havenevermade a mistake.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.343
I assure you,
no legitimate kidney

17:25.345 --> 17:27.311
was delivered to Gramercy
in the last week.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.347
Legitimate?

17:29.349 --> 17:31.416
I'm not going to lie to you.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.419
In India, you can get
a kidney for $20,000.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.788
I mean,
if one were desperate enough,

17:36.790 --> 17:38.389
I suppose
one could go overseas.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.525
Or cross town.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.261
How desperate
was Joanna Woodleigh?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.329
Oh, let's see.

17:48.535 --> 17:53.237
Hmm. On a scale of one to ten,
I'd give her an 11.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.807
Because of the two
failed transplants?

17:55.809 --> 17:58.460
Very good, Detective.

17:58.461 --> 18:01.112
You see, with each rejection,
the body becomes more cytotoxic.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.282
I mean, this girl would need
almost need a perfect match.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.124
Would Mr. MacDaniel's kidney
do the trick?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.195
Four-point match.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.297
That's as good as it gets.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.233
Well, do you have any evidence
tying this doctor

18:22.235 --> 18:24.335
to the attack on the man
in the park?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.504
Not directly.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.173
Joanna Woodleigh
is so hard to match

18:29.175 --> 18:32.210
she's been on a waiting list
for three years.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.445
You believe there were
two compatible kidneys

18:34.447 --> 18:37.281
floating around Manhattan
on the same night?

18:37.283 --> 18:39.150
Now, we know this kidney

18:39.152 --> 18:40.418
didn't come from
the Organ Network,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.353
and I doubt he's going to get it

18:42.355 --> 18:45.490
from the meat section
at Dagastinos.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.425
So, we're assuming
that the transplant surgeon

18:47.427 --> 18:48.559
at a major hospital,

18:48.561 --> 18:52.163
went out and bushwhacked
this guy himself?

18:52.165 --> 18:54.232
Couldn't have been an amateur--
there's too much to cut.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.467
Well, where the hell did he do
this, right there in the bushes?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.669
All we know
is that he did it.

18:58.671 --> 19:02.507
Proving he did it--
that's a long shot.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.248
Two competent people
could remove a kidney.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.300
What about equipment?

19:12.301 --> 19:14.351
To do it right, a
complete operating theater.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.254
How about just to get it done?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.689
It's the carpenter,
not his tools.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.659
Minimum: scalpel, sutures,
anesthesia machine.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.396
Are anesthesia machines
portable?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.597
For Schwartzenegger.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.399
It's about 500 pounds.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.368
You don't just tiptoe
out of a hospital

19:30.370 --> 19:31.369
with one late at night.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.171
Are they expensive?

19:33.173 --> 19:34.372
Expensive enough.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.439
We lease ours.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.942
Suppose I wanted to lease one?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.277
Talk to my secretary,

19:39.279 --> 19:42.330
she'll give you our supplier.

19:42.331 --> 19:45.382
Two months ago, a guy comes in--
ratty hair, beard, the works.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.485
Says he wants
a defibrillator.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.687
I figure, this guy's no M.D.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.224
Turns out, he's some hotshot
lecturer over at downstate.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.594
To think my nephew Petey
ended up in Guadalajara.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.631
Here you go--
one anesthesia machine.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.967
Rented to who?
Reberty, James.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.652
Yeah, I remember.

20:04.653 --> 20:06.336
Some woman called
and charged it to his Am-Ex.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.272
Was her name
Elaine Hale?

20:08.274 --> 20:11.242
488 West 94, Apartment One.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.244
We deliver it, 50 bucks extra,
pickup another 50.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.346
Did she return it?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.515
Picked it up the next day,
hardly used.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.383
You didn't think
it was strange

20:19.385 --> 20:21.485
that Miss Hale had
an anesthesia machine

20:21.487 --> 20:23.387
delivered to
her apartment?

20:23.389 --> 20:27.258
Guy comes in last week,
wants 100 bedpans.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.393
Jell-O molds.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.996
(<i> chuckles</i> )
What do I know?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.668
GREEVEY:
Tell me about Elaine Hale.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.704
WOMAN:
Oh. She's the good one.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.607
Never a sound,
rent on time.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.408
Invites me
to holiday dinner.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.578
(<i> laughs</i> )
They should all be so sweet.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.580
What did she do anyway?

20:49.582 --> 20:52.283
Well, what makes you think
she did anything?

20:52.285 --> 20:54.018
Oh, cops, warrant--

20:54.020 --> 20:57.021
you don't need
to be a Kreskin.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.291
Anything strange
about the last couple of days?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.659
Oh, you want strange?

21:01.661 --> 21:04.395
Those bums in 2E.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.530
Purple hair, gold earring.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.665
Nothing.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.667
What did you expect?

21:09.669 --> 21:13.404
She keeps the place
as clean as an operating room.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.839
She's a nurse, you know.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.674
The bums upstairs,

21:16.676 --> 21:18.809
they don't even
tie their trash,

21:18.811 --> 21:21.412
but Elaine
double-bags hers.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.849
Cats, they should all die.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.351
GREEVEY:
A lot of garbage
for one day, huh?

21:27.353 --> 21:29.487
Ha, that's been there
since Monday.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.455
They pay these guys
more than teachers,

21:31.457 --> 21:33.424
and they come around,
what, twice a week?

21:33.426 --> 21:34.358
Thank you, Mrs. Birnbaum.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.430
No, you're kidding, right?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.734
I just dry-cleaned this suit.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.403
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:47.373 --> 21:49.340
Blood type's
a perfect match.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.608
We got six more just like it

21:50.610 --> 21:52.310
and enough cotton
to make a ball game.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.477
Where did you
find it?

21:53.479 --> 21:54.745
Garbage.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.080
What difference
does it make?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.381
We had a warrant.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.582
A warrant for
her apartment.

21:58.584 --> 22:02.653
Her garbage has
constitutional rights?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.089
It's out in the street,
it's either the city's or hers.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.524
It's called curtilage.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.426
It might be protected.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.630
I'm not saying
it's inadmissible,

22:12.632 --> 22:15.099
but there's
always a chance.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.868
God bless America.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.905
It's enough for me.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.441
Both of them?

22:28.748 --> 22:30.047
MAN:
When Phillip Woodleigh
found out

22:30.049 --> 22:33.617
I was on the board
of the Organ Transplant Network,

22:33.619 --> 22:35.353
he came to my office

22:35.355 --> 22:39.623
and promised to make significant
contributions to O.T.N.,

22:39.625 --> 22:43.828
if I would prioritize
his daughter's case.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.531
And you said?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.033
In 1990,

22:49.035 --> 22:52.737
there were over 100,000
patients on dialysis.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.373
Only 8,800
received kidneys.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.909
Money does not always buy
happiness, Mr. Stone.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.644
Some people might disagree.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.614
It certainly shouldn't buy life.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.915
It is imperative

23:04.917 --> 23:06.917
that these people
be punished.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.687
Reberty and Hale
are being charged.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.822
I don't think you quite
understand, Mr. Stone.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.891
We'd like you to
set your sights

23:13.893 --> 23:15.926
higher up the
food chain.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.062
Woodleigh?

23:18.064 --> 23:20.664
The public must understand that
the Organ Transplant Network

23:20.666 --> 23:23.734
is the one true democracy,

23:23.736 --> 23:29.106
one of the few instances where
money doesn't talk... at all.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.711
I understand.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.946
Defendants are charged
with attempt to commit murder

23:35.948 --> 23:37.915
in the second degree,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.417
assault in the
first degree,

23:39.419 --> 23:41.419
conspiracy in
the first degree,

23:41.421 --> 23:42.853
and grand larceny.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.688
How do you plead?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.123
Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.591
Not guilty.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.060
JUDGE:
Applications, Mr. Robinette?

23:50.062 --> 23:52.430
The People are outraged

23:52.432 --> 23:54.732
at the violent nature of
the crimes charged, Your Honor,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.701
and feel that heinous behavior
of such magnitude

23:57.703 --> 24:00.704
in and of itself demands
bail of $750,000.

24:00.706 --> 24:01.939
PATTON:
May I remind Mr. Robinette

24:01.941 --> 24:03.707
that it's not
the D.A.'S province

24:03.709 --> 24:05.676
to determine punishment
prior to trial.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.844
It would strain
all credibility

24:06.846 --> 24:08.979
to imagine a man
of Dr. Reberty's stature...

24:08.981 --> 24:12.783
Yes, Mr. Patton,
I'm sure we would all prefer

24:12.785 --> 24:14.118
to keep our strain to a minimum.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.219
What do you want?

24:15.221 --> 24:17.021
R.O.R., Your Honor.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.122
Defendants are charged

24:18.124 --> 24:19.723
with violent felonies.

24:19.725 --> 24:22.059
Accused, Mr. Robinette.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.862
May I, Your Honor?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.197
It's your right.

24:26.199 --> 24:27.898
I'm sure

24:27.900 --> 24:30.835
that we all have our
jobs to do, Your Honor,

24:30.837 --> 24:34.472
but there is a 62-year-old
grandmother of six

24:34.474 --> 24:37.475
lying in Gramercy Hospital,
who full well expects

24:37.477 --> 24:41.011
to undergo critical
renal surgery this afternoon.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.147
And?

24:43.149 --> 24:46.217
And the prosecution's
unconscionable demands

24:46.219 --> 24:51.188
would cause her grievous
if not irreparable damage.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.658
We're impressed
with your love of life, Doctor.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.928
Bail is set at $150,000 each.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.232
The top nurse in the city
earns 43,500 a year.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.234
Dr. Reberty could earn
that in a week.

25:03.236 --> 25:06.770
Motive is not part of the
<i> prima facie</i> case for assault.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.272
The credit card receipts...

25:08.274 --> 25:10.274
Do not establish
a material fact.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.177
That's circumstantial evidence
where I come from, Mr. Stone.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.913
They'll get me to a jury,
and then I'll take my chances.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.715
REBERTY:
This is absurd.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.985
Miss Hale is my assistant.

25:20.987 --> 25:24.989
She has access to my cards
and authority to use them.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.691
The entire transaction
took place over the phone.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.927
Without my client's knowledge.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.262
Are you suggesting

25:31.264 --> 25:34.265
that Miss Hale performed
the surgery herself?

25:34.267 --> 25:38.102
Any second-year resident
can remove a kidney, Mr. Stone.

25:38.104 --> 25:43.040
The talent lies with those
that can put one in.

25:53.152 --> 25:57.721
Miss Hale is a competent nurse.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.057
We've been together
for years.

26:00.059 --> 26:04.028
I had intended to let
the credit card business go...

26:06.966 --> 26:10.301
but if it's a help to your case,
I'll testify against her.

26:12.738 --> 26:16.140
What's it going to take
to make you happy, Stone?

26:16.142 --> 26:20.911
The Mets in the Series,
peace on Earth,

26:20.913 --> 26:25.249
and Dr. Reberty in Danamorra.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.851
Let's go, James.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.293
MAN:
<i> Attempted murder is absurd.</i>

26:36.295 --> 26:38.329
Whoever did this
stitched MacDaniels up.

26:38.331 --> 26:40.931
It looks to me like
they wanted him to live.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.066
Now, where's the intent?

26:42.068 --> 26:43.367
Correct me if
I'm wrong, Miss Hale,

26:43.369 --> 26:46.003
but any first-year
surgical resident knows

26:46.005 --> 26:48.138
if you don't tie
the renal vein,
the patient dies,

26:48.140 --> 26:50.207
so whoever operated
on MacDaniel

26:50.209 --> 26:52.776
either didn't know
what he was doing or
wanted him to die.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.878
I saw him tie...
Elaine!

26:54.880 --> 26:56.880
30 more minutes
longer on that bench,
we'd be discussing

26:56.882 --> 26:58.616
a murder charge,
not attempt.
ROBINETTE:
You should also know

26:58.618 --> 27:00.951
he's offered
to testify against you.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.025
Assault one, minimum.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.960
She serves two.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.334
Love isn't blind, it's stupid.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.903
To think
I actually believed in him.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.171
Reberty?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.640
What about Woodleigh?

27:22.642 --> 27:25.142
I had no contact with him.

27:26.812 --> 27:31.382
James swore he would keep
MacDaniel alive.

27:31.384 --> 27:35.819
He said he could close while
I packed the kidney in ice.

27:35.821 --> 27:40.357
We rolled him into the park
in a wheelchair.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.092
I saw the bleeding.

27:42.094 --> 27:45.262
He said it
was just oozing.

27:45.264 --> 27:50.401
He wanted him to die all along,
no loose ends.

27:50.403 --> 27:54.371
I said I wouldn't help
unless he kept him alive.

27:57.009 --> 28:01.445
And we would have lived
happily ever after.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.349
She's an accomplice, Ben.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.918
Even with her testimony,
we need corroboration.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.952
We have the credit receipts.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.087
Unsigned.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.689
She confessed,
she cut a deal.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.290
She obviously needed the money
more than Reberty.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.575
That's a lot of baggage,

28:14.576 --> 28:15.859
especially when he walks
into court

28:15.861 --> 28:17.294
with his awards and testimonials
under his arms.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.929
You believe him?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.397
I'm not the jury.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.032
Who do you think
is more credible?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.168
Why, him, but that's why
we have to discredit him.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.103
Run down
his seven deadly sins.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.205
And start
with credit reports.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.407
Question the family,
the friends, wives.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.176
Ex-wives are always good.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.345
What's the difference
between a doctor and God,

28:35.347 --> 28:36.480
Mr. Robinette?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.349
God doesn't think
he's a doctor.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.385
Is that why you left him?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.287
I was lonely,
not stupid.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.223
Greenwich, Connecticut
is easy to get used to.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.292
But you learn
to live without.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.927
He left you?

28:49.929 --> 28:52.296
Thanks.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.164
Anyway, it was all
for the best.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.434
I hear he sold the place
in Greenwich for a song.

28:57.436 --> 29:01.004
What the hell does a rich
doctor from Connecticut

29:01.006 --> 29:02.906
know about Arizona
anyway?

29:02.908 --> 29:05.642
Arizona?

29:05.643 --> 29:08.377
He put three million into
a string of private hospitals.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.414
And he's losing
his money?

29:10.416 --> 29:14.418
That, or a kidney doesn't go
as far as it used to.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.522
Alimony payments dried
up six months ago.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.391
He'd have put his money in
S and Ls, had he thought of it.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.428
He's being dunned by every bank
from Queens to Albuquerque.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.396
D and B, T.R.W.

29:26.398 --> 29:27.464
He hasn't paid
his phone bill

29:27.466 --> 29:29.099
in three months.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.935
Title report on his real
property will be in next week,

29:31.937 --> 29:32.936
but it's moot.

29:32.937 --> 29:33.936
Bank already told me

29:33.939 --> 29:35.939
about the foreclose
on his East Hampton house.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.407
Reberty had a problem.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.942
Woodleigh had the solution.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.344
And vice versa.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.346
Motive bolsters
the circumstantial evidence.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.515
Physical evidence
would go a long way.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.519
Call Greevey.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.391
Waste of time.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.995
The owner says they clean
everything on the way in

29:57.997 --> 29:59.229
and on the way out.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.848
I read about this guy

30:00.849 --> 30:02.466
who went into a hospital
with a broken leg--

30:02.468 --> 30:04.334
came out
with meningitis.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.171
You gotta stop
reading the obits, Max.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.540
You guys must live
exemplary lives.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.079
Seek and ye shall find.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.481
The good doctor

30:17.483 --> 30:20.217
left the proverbial sponge
in the patient.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.419
The wheelchair they used
to transport the vic--

30:22.421 --> 30:23.587
covered with prints.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.089
Macdaniel,
Hale and...

30:26.091 --> 30:27.090
Reberty?

30:27.092 --> 30:28.091
Bingo.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.359
Excellent.
Thanks, Max.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.229
Sure.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.098
<i> RES IPSA LOQUITUR:</i>
The thing speaks for itself.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.834
He's a doctor.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.569
His prints are probably
on a thousand wheelchairs.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.337
Along with MacDaniels'
and Hale's?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.338
I doubt it.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.439
You still need

30:42.441 --> 30:44.374
a temporal connection.

30:44.376 --> 30:49.379
For 350 an hour, you can do
better than that, Mr. Patton.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.582
All right,
I want a deal.

30:51.584 --> 30:55.118
A deal requires
mutual consideration, doctor.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.621
You've got nothing
that interests me.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.257
Sure, I have.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.459
I've got Woodleigh.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.131
Over and over and over,
the same material.

31:08.133 --> 31:11.335
I'm telling you my friend,
it's a flyer.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.403
Woodleigh gave Reberty
a million dollars

31:13.405 --> 31:15.138
and told him to do

31:15.140 --> 31:16.139
"whatever it takes."

31:16.141 --> 31:17.608
Doesn't mean

31:17.609 --> 31:19.076
that he had the intent
to commit assault.

31:19.078 --> 31:24.314
A border cop stops a car

31:24.316 --> 31:26.550
and finds a hundred pounds
of marijuana in the trunk.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.453
At trial, the driver testifies
that the owner of the car

31:29.455 --> 31:31.622
gave him $100 to drive
cross the border,

31:31.624 --> 31:34.424
but warned him
not to look inside that trunk.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.343
Guilty or not?

31:36.344 --> 31:38.261
He had no actual knowledge
what was in the...

31:38.264 --> 31:39.463
He would have

31:39.465 --> 31:41.131
had he asked the questions.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.067
Willful blindness
never cut it in New York.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.370
So we make new law.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.505
So we get dismissed.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.110
Am I missing something here?

31:53.112 --> 31:56.346
Woodleigh instigated
a vicious attack.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.384
Phillip Woodleigh happens to be
a major political cash cow

32:00.386 --> 32:01.652
in this city.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.154
Good God, Adam.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.490
You're not going to let that
affect your judgment are you?

32:06.492 --> 32:09.393
If I thought you had
a chance in hell of winning,

32:09.395 --> 32:11.295
I'd hold a press conference
right now.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.363
But you can't rewrite the law.

32:13.365 --> 32:17.634
Maybe not, but a personal agenda
should not stop me from trying.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.470
My agenda
has nothing to do with it.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.439
12 times this year alone,

32:22.441 --> 32:27.377
judges have refused to instruct
juries on willful blindness.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.614
13th time could be different.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.352
Yeah. We win at trial,
lose on appeal.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.421
Maybe, maybe not.

32:37.423 --> 32:42.125
"The law should be stable
but should never stand still."

32:42.127 --> 32:45.495
It's nice you can still
quote Holmes.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.197
What does Reberty want?

32:47.199 --> 32:50.534
Drop the murder charge,
and he pleads to assault one.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.302
You call Cragen.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.372
I'll call Woodleigh's attorney,
Dan Rubell.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.508
He was my editor
on the<i> Law Review.</i>

32:58.510 --> 33:00.610
There goes my reunion.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.750
Hey, you know,
it's not every day

33:06.752 --> 33:09.519
we get to bust someone
on Park and 68th Street.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.388
We're not busting him.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.290
He's surrendering.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.429
Mr. Woodleigh.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.531
I hope
this won't take long.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.178
JUDGE:
The charges are
attempted murder,

33:35.180 --> 33:36.413
assault in the first degree,

33:36.415 --> 33:38.215
conspiracy
in the first degree

33:38.217 --> 33:39.750
and grand larceny.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.752
How does the defendant plead?

33:41.754 --> 33:44.087
Not guilty on all charges,
Your Honor.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.390
You have a bail recommendation?

33:46.392 --> 33:48.759
350,000, Judge.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.594
So ordered.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.428
Judge, I'd like to request
that Mr. Woodleigh

33:52.431 --> 33:54.431
be allowed to remain
in the courtroom

33:54.433 --> 33:56.366
while I arrange
a transfer money
from his bank.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.068
For the record,
Your Honor,

33:58.070 --> 33:59.669
The People take exception

33:59.671 --> 34:02.105
to any preferential treatment
shown Mr. Woodleigh.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.374
Do The People believe
Mr. Woodleigh is a flight risk?

34:04.376 --> 34:07.110
It's almost 4:30.
By the time

34:07.112 --> 34:08.211
you're back here,

34:08.213 --> 34:09.663
the defendant will have missed

34:09.664 --> 34:11.114
the prisoners bus
for Rikers Island.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.383
Rikers?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.819
Request denied.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.257
It's not like you, Dan,
to take personal offense.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.125
We're all lawyers here.

34:22.127 --> 34:25.328
I'm glad
you didn't say<i> friends.</i>

34:27.132 --> 34:31.268
Even acquaintances would have
had some sort of... dialogue

34:31.270 --> 34:32.803
about something like this.

34:32.805 --> 34:36.106
You make it sound like Phillip
got the rubber hose treatment.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.207
What's your problem?

34:37.209 --> 34:38.775
My problem is,
I'll have to drive

34:38.777 --> 34:40.644
up to Rikers
during rush hour,

34:40.645 --> 34:42.512
and the damn FDR is still
under construction.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.865
And then I had
to go through security

34:44.866 --> 34:47.217
and those bastards, they
love to bust your chops.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.853
The better your suit,
the worse you're treated.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.288
You know that, Adam.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.490
This is supposed
to be a dialogue.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.525
It sounds more like a diatribe.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.762
The man's a distinguished
lecturer at Columbia.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.231
He's endowed scholarships

35:01.233 --> 35:04.167
at three different universities
in the city.

35:04.169 --> 35:08.171
He single-handedly created
the burn wing at city hospital.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.306
And he's able
to leap tall buildings

35:09.308 --> 35:10.874
in a single bound,
so what?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.442
Mr. Robinett merely
made an observation

35:12.444 --> 35:13.810
as an officer
of the court.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.113
The judge concurred,
so let's move on, all right?

35:16.115 --> 35:21.118
The idea that Phillip Woodleigh
knew anything about an attack

35:21.120 --> 35:24.287
on an innocent victim
is ludicrous in the extreme.

35:24.289 --> 35:28.258
What he says he knew and what
his actual knowledge was

35:28.260 --> 35:30.594
is something
for the court to decide.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.497
You're serious.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.366
You know him, Adam.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.401
The man's 73,
for God's sake.

35:38.403 --> 35:42.372
He's taking hydromorphone
for his heart.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.141
One of his kidneys
is half on the fritz,

35:44.143 --> 35:46.510
and you're threatening
to send him to prison?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.178
It's monstrous.

35:48.180 --> 35:51.815
We'll see he gets a cell
adjoining Dr. Reberty's.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.836
You'd sure as hell
better be right about this.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.546
Mr. Macdaniel, would you
describe for the court

36:22.548 --> 36:25.549
how you felt when
you regained consciousness

36:25.551 --> 36:27.817
that morning
in Central Park.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.953
How I felt?

36:29.955 --> 36:31.454
I felt lousy.

36:31.456 --> 36:33.190
Were you in pain?

36:33.192 --> 36:35.959
They ripped off
one of my kidneys.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.561
And when you first learned
that's what had happened,

36:37.563 --> 36:39.296
how did you feel?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.267
People talk about
feeling violated

36:44.269 --> 36:47.270
when some punk breaks
into their apartment

36:47.272 --> 36:49.339
and steals their TV set.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.343
I felt raped.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.948
Would you mind taking off
your shirt, Mr. MacDaniel?

36:57.950 --> 37:00.350
Objection, Your Honor.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.953
I feel the jury should be able
to see why he felt violated.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.487
Overruled.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.226
Mr. MacDaniel.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.286
One more question.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.990
What do you think would be
a satisfactory conclusion

37:39.992 --> 37:41.524
to this case?

37:43.996 --> 37:46.563
Getting my kidney back.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.498
No further questions.

37:49.635 --> 37:51.301
And did you, in exchange

37:51.303 --> 37:53.570
for sentencing down
on a lesser charge

37:53.572 --> 37:56.473
agree to testify against
Mr. Woodleigh, Doctor?

37:56.475 --> 37:57.974
Yes, I did.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.310
And did you do so
without coercion

38:00.312 --> 38:02.479
and with the full intent
of telling the truth?

38:02.481 --> 38:05.048
That is correct.
Very well.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.450
Now, when you informed
Mr. Woodleigh

38:07.452 --> 38:09.552
that the odds of his obtaining

38:09.554 --> 38:12.389
a perfectly matched kidney
for his daughter

38:12.391 --> 38:14.024
were extremely long,

38:14.026 --> 38:15.392
what did he say?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.027
He said that he didn't care.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.629
He wanted a kidney
whatever the cost.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.064
Whatever the cost.

38:21.066 --> 38:24.934
Yet Dr. Backus just testified

38:24.936 --> 38:26.936
that he informed
the Woodleigh family

38:26.938 --> 38:30.006
of the impossibility
of buying a kidney.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.976
Legally, that is.

38:32.978 --> 38:37.981
Do you think Mr. Woodleigh
fully understood

38:37.983 --> 38:40.350
what he was asking you
to do for him?

38:40.352 --> 38:41.618
Objection, Your Honor.
Speculation.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.486
Sustained.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.957
Did Mr. Woodleigh ever ask you

38:47.959 --> 38:49.659
what the potential problems
might be?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.961
No, he didn't.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.998
His only words were
"whatever the cost."

38:55.000 --> 38:59.102
And how much did the kidney
cost Mr. Woodleigh?

38:59.104 --> 39:02.372
A little over a million.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.108
STONE:
No further questions.

39:06.678 --> 39:10.580
Dr. Reberty, did Mr. Woodleigh
ever ask you to go out

39:10.582 --> 39:13.083
and cut open an innocent man?

39:15.754 --> 39:18.488
If you would answer yes or no,
please,

39:19.991 --> 39:22.826
Well... no.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.128
Did you ever tell him

39:25.130 --> 39:29.099
you planned to cut open
an innocent man?

39:29.101 --> 39:33.603
As I just stated,
he told me to do whatever was...

39:33.605 --> 39:36.106
Did you ever tell him, Doctor?
Yes or no, please.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.509
No.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.689
Excuse me, Mr. Stone.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.093
I'm Joanna Woodleigh.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.131
Come in, Miss Woodleigh.

40:01.133 --> 40:05.101
Are you aware that my father
has established a trust fund

40:05.103 --> 40:07.837
for Mr. MacDaniel
and his children?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.572
No.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.576
I didn't think so.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.614
That's the way he works--
quietly,

40:17.616 --> 40:22.085
unselfishly.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.488
If you prosecute him,
he'll die.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.157
I know he will.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.892
And for what?

40:28.894 --> 40:32.495
Mr. MacDaniel is going
to be a wealthy man.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.097
With only one kidney.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.567
Just like I have, Mr. Stone.

40:37.569 --> 40:41.838
The hope is, we'll both live
long and happy lives.

40:45.177 --> 40:48.611
Please believe me,
I'm glad you're healthy again.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.614
I know how close
to death you were.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.150
But, Miss Woodleigh,

40:54.152 --> 40:58.655
do you really think your father
would have acted any differently

40:58.657 --> 41:03.793
if you had needed a heart
instead of a kidney?

41:14.706 --> 41:17.640
Whatever part
I may have played--

41:17.642 --> 41:20.877
unwittingly played--
in Mr. MacDaniel's pain

41:20.879 --> 41:22.879
will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

41:22.881 --> 41:26.216
Unwittingly.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.685
Where did you think the organ

41:28.687 --> 41:30.186
your daughter
so desperately needed

41:30.188 --> 41:31.621
came from, Mr. Woodleigh?

41:31.623 --> 41:33.156
I had no idea.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.925
I assumed it was
an innocent transaction.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.895
But frankly, given the urgency
of the situation,

41:38.897 --> 41:40.697
I really didn't ask.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.633
I mean Gramercy is one of the
most reputable hospitals

41:43.635 --> 41:45.168
in the world, so why would I?

41:45.170 --> 41:49.272
No further questions,
Your Honor.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.875
You're a businessman,
Mr. Woodleigh.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.177
A highly successful businessman.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.579
Well, I've been fortunate, yes.

41:56.581 --> 41:59.582
And, uh, you probably make it
your business

41:59.584 --> 42:02.185
to ask pertinent questions
before you enter a deal.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.186
Is that true?

42:03.188 --> 42:04.588
Objection,
Your Honor.

42:04.589 --> 42:05.989
Mr. Woodleigh's
business transactions

42:05.991 --> 42:07.790
are not on trial here.

42:07.792 --> 42:08.791
This goes to intent, Your Honor.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.159
Overruled.

42:10.161 --> 42:12.595
Why didn't you inquire
into a transaction

42:12.597 --> 42:16.232
that was costing you a million
dollars, Mr. Woodleigh?

42:16.234 --> 42:18.868
Because my daughter's life
was at stake.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.020
But still, a million dollars...

42:21.021 --> 42:23.171
Does that really jibe
with your characterization

42:23.174 --> 42:25.909
of this deal
as an innocent transaction?

42:25.911 --> 42:29.212
Well, I, uh... I don't
want to sound immodest,

42:29.214 --> 42:30.780
but there's a term
my accountant uses,

42:30.782 --> 42:32.916
it's called
"creeping decimalism."

42:32.918 --> 42:37.787
He means by that that once
you start adding on zeros,

42:37.789 --> 42:41.291
the sum starts
to become unreal.

42:41.293 --> 42:45.261
In other words, you would
do anything for your daughter.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.663
Absolutely.

42:46.665 --> 42:48.031
Even something illegal?

42:48.033 --> 42:49.032
Wouldn't any father?

42:49.034 --> 42:51.184
Wouldn't you, Mr. Stone?

42:51.185 --> 42:53.335
I'm not on trial, sir,
and I ask the questions here.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.278
Does that "anything"
include murder, sir?

43:02.280 --> 43:03.980
No, sir.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.501
Woodleigh knew, Adam.

43:07.502 --> 43:09.052
I know he knew exactly
what Reberty was up to,

43:09.054 --> 43:10.653
and I can't move him an inch.

43:10.655 --> 43:13.623
If you do, the jury
will feel sorry for him.

43:13.625 --> 43:17.860
Remember his words: Any father
would have done the same thing.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.262
If he had a million bucks.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.263
Two million.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.264
What?

43:21.266 --> 43:22.665
Title report

43:22.667 --> 43:24.367
to Dr. Reberty's beach house,

43:24.368 --> 43:26.068
the one First Federal was
about to foreclose on.

43:26.071 --> 43:29.038
He managed to sell it for twice
the fair market value--

43:29.040 --> 43:30.907
one million bucks.

43:30.909 --> 43:33.042
I thought we were in a
recession. Who bought it?

43:33.044 --> 43:35.945
Montauk Investments Limited--

43:35.947 --> 43:38.648
one of Woodleigh's
shell corporations.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.333
When?

43:40.334 --> 43:42.017
Papers were filed right
after we arrested Reberty.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.387
I'll be damned.

43:44.389 --> 43:47.390
There's only one reason why
he paid him another million.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.958
To buy his silence.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.259
But he testified.

43:50.261 --> 43:53.963
He testified,
but did he fully testify?

43:53.965 --> 43:57.033
Kind of a stretch, Ben.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.002
I didn't call you in
to watch you tap dance.

43:59.004 --> 44:01.371
Dr. Reberty and I need
time to go over it.

44:01.373 --> 44:03.406
Consider this an official
notification, Doctor:

44:03.408 --> 44:05.008
Our deal is off.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.976
We intend to charge you
with attempted murder.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.979
And any leniency you may have
hoped for is out the window.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.748
That was very cute--

44:11.750 --> 44:13.049
"A little over a million."

44:13.051 --> 44:14.350
A<i> million</i> over a million, sir.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.019
What did Woodleigh
actually say to you

44:16.021 --> 44:17.787
to abide the sins
of omission on the stand?

44:17.789 --> 44:19.088
May I say something?

44:21.726 --> 44:24.394
I'd like to propose a new deal.

44:24.396 --> 44:27.047
Oh, really?

44:27.048 --> 44:29.699
You need requisite
culpable intent on Woodleigh.

44:34.039 --> 44:36.105
Now you've got it.

44:39.744 --> 44:42.879
REBERTY (<i> on tape</i> ):
We've found the perfect match.

44:42.881 --> 44:43.980
Woodleigh:
And?

44:43.982 --> 44:45.982
REBERTY:
Well, he's a healthy guy.

44:45.984 --> 44:51.054
I don't think he's going to want
to give up one of his kidneys

44:51.056 --> 44:52.789
without a struggle.

44:52.791 --> 44:54.123
WOODLEIGH:
You do whatever it takes.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.792
Now, that's what you're
getting paid for.

44:55.794 --> 44:58.995
REBERTY:
I don't think that
you understand, Phillip.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.963
This isn't a question
of going up...

45:00.965 --> 45:02.732
WOODLEIGH:
No, I understand perfectly well.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.468
Now you kill the son of a bitch
if you have to.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.136
Just do it.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.872
(<i> tape recorder clicks</i> )

45:13.344 --> 45:17.046
Dr. Reberty, did you record
what the court just heard?

45:17.048 --> 45:19.849
REBERTY:
Yes, I did.

45:24.489 --> 45:27.156
Is this the cassette
you used?

45:28.793 --> 45:30.393
Yes, it is.

45:53.952 --> 45:57.086
Woodleigh's already filed
his notice of appeal.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.821
Thought you'd be
interested to know.

45:58.823 --> 45:59.822
We made our point.

45:59.824 --> 46:00.673
Which was?

46:00.674 --> 46:01.523
Money can't buy everything.

46:01.526 --> 46:03.960
Keeps a lot of lawyers busy.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.095
Two million dollars
for a kidney...

46:06.097 --> 46:10.500
The last I heard, the whole
human body in raw material

46:10.502 --> 46:13.069
isn't worth more than 98 cents.

46:13.071 --> 46:14.937
Good night, gentlemen.

46:14.939 --> 46:17.874
Good night.
You never answered
Woodleigh's question,

46:17.876 --> 46:19.442
the one we had stricken.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.009
You mean would I have done
what Woodleigh did

46:21.012 --> 46:21.043
if it were my daughter?
God, I hope not.
