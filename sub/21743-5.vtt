00:00.711 --> 00:02.192
I was born here.

00:02.205 --> 00:03.722
I grew up here. My friends are here,

00:03.746 --> 00:05.998
my work is here. There's
only one way I'm leaving now

00:06.045 --> 00:07.487
and that's in a coffin.

00:07.607 --> 00:08.841
That's good to know.

00:09.267 --> 00:10.767
It's better if you go back to your mum.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.302
But you said this is my home.

00:13.586 --> 00:15.494
- Tom!
- I'll drop your things round later.

00:16.055 --> 00:18.565
- Tom!
- I never want to see him again.

00:20.264 --> 00:22.225
You're not going to waste 15 years.

00:22.581 --> 00:24.285
Tonight's when you escape.

00:24.857 --> 00:26.036
What's going on?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.277
- You're not taking her.
- You're never going to see me again.

00:28.324 --> 00:29.941
- Come on!
- You're never going to see Amelie again.

00:29.981 --> 00:31.645
- You're obsessed.
- Please, Kate.

00:31.662 --> 00:32.998
Have her!

00:35.368 --> 00:37.924
My daughter! My family!

00:37.953 --> 00:40.288
- I didn't do any of that.
- No, no,

00:40.340 --> 00:42.185
- no!
- Your wife and your daughter have moved away.

00:42.196 --> 00:44.466
Your mother is dead and
you threw your own son out

00:44.508 --> 00:47.659
- so there's nothing left for you here.
- You think you've won.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.404
Look, I'm still here.

00:50.653 --> 00:51.674
Where are you going?

00:51.715 --> 00:53.145
To get my son.

00:53.991 --> 00:55.369
We need to talk.

Shit! Shit.

01:38.747 --> 01:40.246
Shit.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.496
We need to go. Your
dad knows where we are.

02:52.807 --> 02:55.246
But you said I didn't have to see him.

02:55.247 --> 02:56.696
What does he want?

02:57.777 --> 03:00.166
To talk to you. Kate
has gone with Amelie,

03:00.167 --> 03:03.356
he's been kicked out
of his house, his work.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.516
Could you help me, please?

03:05.517 --> 03:07.386
I just thought once
everyone left him, he'd...

03:08.417 --> 03:09.916
... realise it was over.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.376
Where are we going?

03:12.737 --> 03:14.186
Home.

03:16.387 --> 03:17.706
We have to go.

03:27.317 --> 03:28.906
If he wants to talk, maybe I should.

03:28.907 --> 03:30.406
What would you say?

03:31.487 --> 03:32.796
No, it's a bad idea.

04:07.627 --> 04:09.126
It's fine, it's going to be OK.

04:12.407 --> 04:13.726
Tom?

04:43.821 --> 04:45.830
This'll be the next place he'll try.

04:45.831 --> 04:47.190
I had the locks changed.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.730
And we can always call the police.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.790
Where is everything?

04:55.911 --> 04:59.660
Gone, most of it, but
your room's in storage.

04:59.661 --> 05:01.820
Anna sorted it before she left.

05:01.821 --> 05:03.790
We agreed, remember? New start?

05:03.791 --> 05:04.960
It's weird.

05:07.351 --> 05:08.810
Yeah, I know.

05:14.291 --> 05:18.040
Look, Tom, in the end, I
can't order him to leave.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.240
But at least now there's
less reason for him to stay.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.450
What are these?

05:24.321 --> 05:26.530
I was hoping by now he'd be gone and

05:26.531 --> 05:30.280
we'd come back home with a blank slate,

05:30.281 --> 05:32.670
we'd want to make some
decisions about the future.

05:32.671 --> 05:34.030
We've never had a new kitchen.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.200
Yeah, right?

05:35.201 --> 05:37.070
I thought you'd help me choose.

05:39.601 --> 05:40.960
I might move out next year.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.920
Max's sister did it when
she was 16, lived by herself.

05:43.921 --> 05:45.560
She said it was possible.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.950
What did your dad say, about
me, that made you go with him?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.450
I told you, it doesn't matter.

05:52.451 --> 05:54.840
I thought we were...
We were never like this.

05:54.841 --> 05:55.970
Choose what you want.

06:04.681 --> 06:06.040
Mum?

06:12.421 --> 06:13.830
He's just standing there.

06:19.781 --> 06:21.190
Tom.

06:21.191 --> 06:22.410
No.

06:23.391 --> 06:25.170
Tom, this isn't a good idea.

06:29.201 --> 06:30.330
Mate.

06:30.331 --> 06:33.750
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah.

06:33.751 --> 06:35.910
- Go on, then.
- No, I meant without your mum.

06:35.911 --> 06:37.130
Say it here.

06:40.171 --> 06:44.200
All right. Well, I assume she's
told you what's happened with Kate...

06:45.381 --> 06:48.240
... and Amelie. I'm
obviously upset and...

06:49.411 --> 06:50.444
I suppose I need your help.

06:50.445 --> 06:52.410
- Simon, he's 15.
- Shut up!

06:52.411 --> 06:55.690
I was looking after my mum
when I was 15. 15 is old.

06:55.691 --> 06:58.130
Stop trying to protect him,
it doesn't work. Does it, mate?

07:03.001 --> 07:05.060
I'm sorry I didn't let you in the house.

07:05.061 --> 07:07.130
Kate was concerned after what you did.

07:07.131 --> 07:11.490
- Oh, so it's my fault.
- I thought we'd sort it out in time, but now...

07:11.491 --> 07:13.740
The thing is, I literally
don't know who else to turn to.

07:13.741 --> 07:16.270
Mum gave you some money
to get a hotel room.

07:16.271 --> 07:17.680
Yeah, well, I don't want her...

07:17.681 --> 07:19.080
- I don't want that.
- Why not?

07:22.221 --> 07:23.350
Stay away from him.

07:33.751 --> 07:36.330
Sometimes children have to
look after their parents.

07:37.931 --> 07:39.900
It's not like I'm the
only one to blame, she's...

07:42.241 --> 07:43.546
Are you going to stay with your mum now,

07:43.547 --> 07:45.150
after everything we spoke about?

07:45.151 --> 07:47.350
- What are you doing?
- Asking questions...

07:47.351 --> 07:49.320
No, you're using me to get at her.

07:49.321 --> 07:50.539
- I just need...
- You're obsessed.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.990
... someone who understands me.

07:51.991 --> 07:54.100
- Well, I don't.
- OK, well, we just...

07:54.101 --> 07:55.460
- Leave us alone!
- Just...

07:58.041 --> 07:59.820
If I had a knife now, I'd stab you,

07:59.821 --> 08:01.320
I would, I would stab you.

08:02.541 --> 08:05.590
Here and here and here.

08:05.591 --> 08:07.460
You should stab yourself.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.450
Maybe I will. Maybe I will!

08:19.131 --> 08:22.410
- Are you OK?
- What did you say to him as I walked away?

08:22.411 --> 08:24.990
- What?
- He shouted at you.

08:24.991 --> 08:27.200
Maybe I will. Will what?

08:29.211 --> 08:30.620
I told him to leave us alone.

08:34.091 --> 08:35.780
- I'll deal with it.
- Why won't he stop?

08:35.780 --> 08:38.260
- What does he want?
- It's fine. Go upstairs.

08:58.981 --> 09:01.790
Hi. We've just moved in across the way.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.510
I'm Lucy. This is Harry and Matty.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.780
- Gemma.
- Hi!

09:05.781 --> 09:09.480
- Hi.
- We're just exploring, meeting people, so...

09:09.481 --> 09:12.150
My husband just got this
new job. Short notice, so...

09:14.401 --> 09:17.780
- You're in the middle of something.
- No, look, erm...

09:17.781 --> 09:19.790
Maybe tomorrow, if you're around then...

09:21.251 --> 09:23.450
... we could chat. Is that OK?

09:23.451 --> 09:25.650
Perfect. Have a good evening.

09:25.651 --> 09:28.420
OK, bye. Will you say bye-bye?

09:28.421 --> 09:30.440
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:39.811 --> 09:40.980
He's gone, then?

09:54.301 --> 09:55.700
Don't worry, I'm back.

09:57.201 --> 09:59.830
Safe and sound, the breadwinner returns.

09:59.831 --> 10:01.800
Hey, how was physics?

10:01.801 --> 10:03.910
- Yeah, good.
- Are you going to say hello?

10:03.911 --> 10:05.780
- Hello!
- Charming.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.880
I thought you were back at six.

10:08.881 --> 10:12.770
Right, well, I'm an increasingly
successful entrepreneur.

10:12.771 --> 10:14.780
Most of them tend to work
until the early hours,

10:14.781 --> 10:19.050
but you are lucky to have a
husband with the right priorities.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.816
The fact that I'm back home at seven

10:20.817 --> 10:24.960
is testament to the importance
of my family in my life.

10:24.961 --> 10:26.690
Well, I'm glad you
spelled that out for me.

10:26.691 --> 10:29.220
You wouldn't believe the amount
of paperwork I have to do.

10:29.221 --> 10:30.670
You're talking to a GP.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.280
Have you packed for the weekend?

10:34.281 --> 10:36.250
- Do it in a minute.
- Where you off to?

10:36.251 --> 10:38.270
- London?
- Hemel Hampstead.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.770
Ooh, the glamour.

10:39.771 --> 10:41.270
Quite nice, actually. What's this?

10:41.271 --> 10:44.460
Oh, I thought I'd cook something
before my husband got too old to eat.

10:44.461 --> 10:46.940
40's the new 30.

10:46.941 --> 10:48.250
Ah, 40 is old.

10:48.251 --> 10:49.750
You're nearly 40 yourself.

10:49.751 --> 10:51.160
I will never be 40.

10:51.161 --> 10:53.220
- Magic potion?
- Moisturiser.

10:53.221 --> 10:54.440
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

10:54.441 --> 10:55.900
Yeah, that's what it is.

10:59.551 --> 11:03.070
So, Tom's worried that we're
out of the house too much.

11:03.071 --> 11:04.570
He wants me home earlier.

11:05.601 --> 11:08.040
You haven't spoken to him
about it, said anything?

11:08.041 --> 11:09.770
- What do you mean?
- About my hours.

11:09.771 --> 11:11.600
Like being annoyed
with them or anything?

11:11.601 --> 11:13.990
- He must have got it from somewhere.
- No.

11:15.161 --> 11:17.510
OK. OK, fine.

11:20.371 --> 11:22.660
- Can you pack?
- Absolutely.

11:22.661 --> 11:24.400
Do you know where your suitcase is?

11:24.401 --> 11:26.230
- In the loft.
- No, it's in the wardrobe.

11:26.231 --> 11:28.430
Right. What am I
getting for my birthday?

11:28.431 --> 11:31.620
A smack in the face
if you ask that again!

11:39.211 --> 11:40.620
Well, congratulations.

11:40.621 --> 11:42.210
Cheers. Well, here's to you.

11:42.211 --> 11:44.130
- Cheers. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

11:44.131 --> 11:46.060
Sorry I missed the reception.

11:47.181 --> 11:50.040
Well, you saw us getting
married, that's the main thing.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.350
My speech was really funny.

11:52.431 --> 11:53.506
Loads of laughs.

11:53.507 --> 11:56.280
Which is not exactly what a
groom is meant to be after.

11:56.281 --> 11:58.480
I still made you cry. Three times.

12:00.071 --> 12:02.140
So what's happening with school?

12:02.141 --> 12:03.820
Karen said it's permanent exclusion,

12:03.821 --> 12:05.600
but we're going to appeal the decision.

12:05.601 --> 12:06.820
So it goes to the governors?

12:06.821 --> 12:08.117
Well, generally, it's a fair process,

12:08.118 --> 12:10.100
but either way, we need a quick decision

12:10.101 --> 12:11.930
cos Tom's got his exams to think about.

12:11.931 --> 12:12.814
- Mm.
- Tom?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.560
He won't have any
problems with his exams.

12:14.561 --> 12:16.900
Don't say that, it's really hard work.

12:16.901 --> 12:18.210
He always works hard!

12:18.211 --> 12:19.430
Don't you?

12:23.101 --> 12:25.335
Well, look, the important thing

12:25.336 --> 12:28.490
is you two are back
at home with friends.

12:28.491 --> 12:31.070
Let's start looking
after each other now, OK?

12:32.291 --> 12:33.550
I'd like that.

12:37.541 --> 12:39.550
Is Simon still about?

12:39.551 --> 12:42.460
We're not going to see him again.

12:42.501 --> 12:45.510
- That's what Tom wants.
- But he's staying at... ?

12:45.511 --> 12:48.690
- We don't know where he is.
- What time we going home?

12:48.731 --> 12:50.150
When we've finished.

12:51.651 --> 12:55.540
Tom was saying he might
move out next year.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.220
- Oh.
- What?! Why?

12:57.221 --> 12:59.570
- It's a good idea.
- Don't encourage him.

13:01.161 --> 13:02.520
He's 16, he's grown-up.

13:02.521 --> 13:04.820
Nearly 16 and where's he going to live?

13:04.821 --> 13:06.830
- Find a place, won't you?
- Money?

13:06.831 --> 13:08.520
Get a job.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.070
Claim benefits.

13:11.241 --> 13:13.910
It's independence,
people don't do it enough.

13:13.911 --> 13:16.260
Of course, you have to
declare yourself homeless

13:16.261 --> 13:19.300
before the council will help
you out. You'd rent, deposit.

13:19.301 --> 13:21.600
Technically, you need
your parents' consent.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.320
And you have to work all the
hours in the day, I'd imagine.

13:27.561 --> 13:29.150
I really want to go now.

13:34.631 --> 13:35.850
- Oh, God.
- Call the police.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.210
No.

13:37.211 --> 13:39.560
- Want me to get rid of him?
- I'll talk to him.

13:39.561 --> 13:41.060
No. OK, OK.

13:41.061 --> 13:43.170
- Just get rid of him.
- It's OK.

13:43.171 --> 13:44.760
I'll go. You stay here.

13:55.171 --> 13:57.180
It should be me in there.

13:57.181 --> 13:59.981
- What?
- It should be me with you and Tom,

13:59.982 --> 14:01.680
our friends, having dinner.

14:01.681 --> 14:04.450
- Right, well, I think you know why that...
- It's possible.

14:04.451 --> 14:08.340
- The offer still stands.
- You could just decide to forgive everything.

14:08.341 --> 14:10.640
- What?!
- You're not the right one in this.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.230
We are as bad as each other.

14:12.231 --> 14:13.760
- No.
- You told Kate

14:13.761 --> 14:15.320
I was trying to make her like you.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.356
You manipulated her,
you took her away from me

14:17.357 --> 14:19.170
and it wasn't for any good reason.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.180
- Tom wanted you gone.
- It was revenge.

14:21.181 --> 14:23.200
It made you feel good to
win, that's all it was.

14:23.201 --> 14:24.421
OK, how does this end, Simon?

14:24.422 --> 14:26.110
Because we're outside, it's late and...

14:26.111 --> 14:28.970
It ends with us admitting
we both got it so wrong,

14:28.971 --> 14:30.190
letting it all go...

14:31.171 --> 14:32.530
... and getting back together.

14:38.531 --> 14:40.059
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're attracted to each other,

14:40.060 --> 14:41.720
so that works.

14:41.721 --> 14:43.360
We can be his parents again.

14:45.471 --> 14:49.550
I'll get some job, earn a bit of
money, but we give Tom stability.

14:49.551 --> 14:52.970
No. When it's just the three of us
together it works, you know that.

14:55.171 --> 14:57.420
We could decide to be a family again.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.895
Forgive each other for the sake

14:59.896 --> 15:01.296
- of the rest of our lives.
- Simon...

15:01.371 --> 15:02.385
It's not too late.

15:02.386 --> 15:04.170
I move back in, we just get on with it.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.819
It's been a bad couple of years,

15:05.820 --> 15:07.690
but we could be proud that
we got him back on track.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.940
You think that we should get
back together for the sake of Tom?

15:09.941 --> 15:12.470
- Not just Tom.
- You think that that's in any way what he wants?

15:12.471 --> 15:13.830
It's what I want.

15:13.831 --> 15:16.170
I think you do too, really.

15:16.171 --> 15:17.390
Underneath.

15:20.161 --> 15:21.560
I brought you something.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.190
In...

15:24.191 --> 15:27.050
In this moment, my life is
basically over, can you take this?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.220
- No.
- Please.

15:29.771 --> 15:31.170
Please.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.320
Thank you.

15:39.141 --> 15:42.240
Sort yourself out and move on.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.300
- Your life isn't over.
- I don't want to move on.

15:44.301 --> 15:46.130
We are never letting
you back into our lives.

15:46.131 --> 15:47.910
- Gemma, please.
- You're ruining my evening.

15:49.831 --> 15:52.180
How much is it going to
take for you to go away?

15:52.181 --> 15:54.000
Fucking insulting.

15:54.001 --> 15:56.540
You don't have any idea
what I'm feeling right now.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.990
I should choke you to death.

15:57.991 --> 16:01.260
One minute you say how easy it
would be to get back together with us

16:01.261 --> 16:03.520
and the next minute you're saying
you want to choke me to death?

16:03.521 --> 16:05.960
That's every family,
because you care about them!

16:06.991 --> 16:08.870
You get what's happening?

16:08.871 --> 16:11.070
If you leave this,

16:11.071 --> 16:14.210
if you walk away, I will stab myself.

16:14.211 --> 16:16.830
- You want me to.
- Simon, don't be stupid, I didn't mean that...

16:16.831 --> 16:18.990
Yeah, but you did, you did mean it.

16:25.131 --> 16:27.100
It's OK, it's all right.

16:27.101 --> 16:29.260
- Tom.
- Can you come back inside, please?

16:29.261 --> 16:30.620
- Tom.
- Mum?

16:32.071 --> 16:33.150
Yes.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.900
Mate, you just going to ignore
me, then, like I don't exist?

16:37.981 --> 16:39.100
Tom...

16:42.521 --> 16:44.490
You tell yourself
these stories about how

16:44.491 --> 16:46.792
you actually are a good dad
or a good husband or whatever,

16:46.793 --> 16:48.380
and it's all total shit.

16:48.381 --> 16:50.770
The only way you get through
life is by lying to yourself,

16:50.771 --> 16:53.540
because if you stopped, you'd
realise you're a massive failure.

16:55.511 --> 16:57.200
That is the actual truth, isn't it?

17:00.531 --> 17:01.790
So we're done.

17:05.401 --> 17:06.619
YOU can go away now.

17:07.741 --> 17:09.150
Tom, come back inside.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.170
Tom...

17:34.141 --> 17:35.260
Thanks.

18:05.921 --> 18:08.170
You need to call the police.
Get an order against him.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.620
He got the message this time.

18:09.621 --> 18:10.610
Tom...

18:11.781 --> 18:13.090
Tom was very clear.

18:14.031 --> 18:15.250
Good.

18:16.881 --> 18:18.720
Look, I'm glad you called tonight.

18:18.721 --> 18:21.720
You left before I had a
chance to give this to you.

18:21.721 --> 18:24.200
Maybe now let's call it
a welcome home present.

18:24.201 --> 18:26.500
- Present?
- We can have a new start.

18:27.671 --> 18:28.800
Some new things.

18:30.861 --> 18:31.990
Oh, wow.

18:34.241 --> 18:35.270
Oh, my God.

18:36.581 --> 18:38.270
Want to try them on?

18:39.811 --> 18:41.270
Um...

18:49.101 --> 18:50.270
You like?

18:52.281 --> 18:53.550
I love them.

19:05.131 --> 19:06.540
- I might just get some water.
- Sure.

19:30.261 --> 19:32.130
You never talk about your mum and dad.

19:32.131 --> 19:33.400
I thought you were asleep.

19:35.411 --> 19:39.070
I know they died in a car
accident when you were a teenager.

19:40.381 --> 19:41.550
Yeah.

19:43.011 --> 19:45.120
16. About your age.

19:45.121 --> 19:49.010
Right. But apart from
that, I don't know anything.

19:49.011 --> 19:51.960
- What did they do?
- Dad was a lecturer in history

19:51.961 --> 19:54.070
and Mum worked in a nursing home.

19:55.481 --> 19:56.410
Did you like them?

19:57.491 --> 20:00.910
- I loved them.
- Were they together and loved you?

20:03.541 --> 20:05.320
I think so.

20:05.361 --> 20:06.260
Yeah.

20:07.481 --> 20:10.290
Well, I think that even though
they died, you were luckier than me.

20:15.961 --> 20:18.540
- Dad won't ever stop.
- He understood.

20:18.541 --> 20:19.900
Tonight.

20:21.031 --> 20:22.390
It's hard, I know, but...

20:23.561 --> 20:25.480
- ... it's what you were feeling and perhaps...
- No,

20:25.481 --> 20:28.850
even if he goes away for a bit,
he could come back at any time.

20:28.851 --> 20:31.340
You read stories about dads
who can't see their kids.

20:31.341 --> 20:33.640
They set the house on
fire or get a knife.

20:33.641 --> 20:35.750
- He wouldn't do any of that.
- Yeah, he would.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.320
You already thought that if Kate
left him and he lost the house,

20:38.321 --> 20:41.040
- he'd just give up.
- I hoped he'd just... leave.

20:43.531 --> 20:44.980
Start again.

20:47.561 --> 20:49.110
You didn't just want to hurt him?

20:50.421 --> 20:51.590
No.

20:53.331 --> 20:54.360
Punish him?

20:55.391 --> 20:56.560
I wanted him gone.

20:58.671 --> 21:00.450
But if you're asking do I feel guilty...

21:01.621 --> 21:02.940
I didn't start this.

21:04.061 --> 21:06.690
We were fine before he came
back and started bullying me

21:06.691 --> 21:08.050
and trying to take you away.

21:08.051 --> 21:10.440
All I did was tell people
the truth about him.

21:44.421 --> 21:46.300
Did you talk to Tom?

21:48.221 --> 21:51.970
Yeah. I asked him if he was
worried about the hours we're doing.

21:54.131 --> 21:56.380
He said...

22:00.551 --> 22:03.550
He said sometimes he
thinks you're not listening.

22:03.551 --> 22:05.890
You're... thinking about work.

22:07.111 --> 22:10.440
Sometimes he wishes you
were a bit softer with him.

22:13.631 --> 22:14.610
Wow.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.630
OK.

22:17.851 --> 22:19.250
What did you say?

22:19.251 --> 22:21.740
That you weren't just his mum.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.421
You had a job.

22:23.422 --> 22:25.441
Responsibility for a lot of people.

22:25.442 --> 22:28.201
He was lucky you were so
talented and in demand.

22:30.882 --> 22:31.911
Right.

22:33.222 --> 22:34.671
You're a brilliant mum.

22:43.442 --> 22:44.751
Love you.

22:46.442 --> 22:47.571
Do you want this?

22:49.252 --> 22:51.930
- Why?
- So that when we're old and unhappy

22:51.931 --> 22:53.661
and in there watching TV all day,

22:53.662 --> 22:56.001
you can remember that once
upon a time, we had fun.

22:59.052 --> 23:01.071
Let's never get old and unhappy.

23:02.712 --> 23:04.161
Deal.

24:15.982 --> 24:17.201
Tom?

24:30.142 --> 24:32.061
- What's going on?
- Tom's not here.

24:32.062 --> 24:34.361
I just heard a car leaving.

24:39.282 --> 24:41.571
Do you think he's... ?
He was talking about moving.

24:42.692 --> 24:45.371
No, he'd... plan for
that, take his things.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.931
Simon's taken him
somehow, he's made him go.

24:48.932 --> 24:50.835
Taken him? Come on,

24:50.836 --> 24:52.451
it's not like Simon could
have physically made him.

24:52.452 --> 24:55.031
- Threatened him or...
- He's probably gone off with some friends,

24:55.032 --> 24:57.141
some crisis he's having
in the middle of the night.

24:57.142 --> 24:58.971
He doesn't have any
friends at the moment.

25:00.942 --> 25:02.163
Why are you taking that?

25:02.164 --> 25:04.641
In case something's happened to Tom.

25:04.642 --> 25:07.031
- Hey, come here, you need to stop and think.
- Let go of me.

25:09.372 --> 25:11.441
Why don't you stay here,
call around, I'll find Tom.

25:11.442 --> 25:13.731
You think I'm going to let anyone
stop me from getting my son?

25:13.772 --> 25:15.001
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

25:15.002 --> 25:17.481
- I'm not letting you do this.
- Nobody tells me what to do.

25:17.482 --> 25:19.971
Tom was right, I messed you
around time and time again

25:19.972 --> 25:22.361
- and you just keep on coming back.
- I don't mind that.

25:22.362 --> 25:24.191
I think ultimately you like fixing me.

25:24.192 --> 25:25.411
- No.
- Bird with a broken wing.

25:25.412 --> 25:26.671
No, Gemma, I LIKE you, Gemma.

25:26.672 --> 25:28.131
I'm not broken.

25:29.862 --> 25:34.031
Sorry. We're not working
and it needs to stop.

25:36.562 --> 25:38.441
I'll stay here in case he comes back.

25:39.892 --> 25:40.921
Thank you.

26:03.852 --> 26:04.971
Tom?

26:04.972 --> 26:06.941
- Dad, that's mine.
- Tom!

26:06.942 --> 26:09.141
Give it back. Give it back!

26:09.142 --> 26:10.881
Leave us alone.

26:10.882 --> 26:13.321
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Leave us alone.

26:16.412 --> 26:18.151
Please don't hurt him.

26:18.152 --> 26:20.161
Dad. Dad!

26:20.162 --> 26:21.471
Just please don't...

26:51.762 --> 26:55.551
- Morning.
- Hi, my husband is staying here, Simon Foster.

26:55.552 --> 26:57.851
- Do you have his room number?
- Husband?

26:57.852 --> 26:59.401
Foster.

26:59.402 --> 27:00.746
- I thought it was...
- When I was here before,

27:00.747 --> 27:02.161
I used my maiden name.

27:03.522 --> 27:05.211
We don't have a Foster, I'm afraid.

27:05.212 --> 27:06.851
He's with my son.

27:06.852 --> 27:09.661
There can't be that many men
checking in with a teenager.

27:11.402 --> 27:12.851
This is urgent.

27:17.772 --> 27:19.181
- 137.
- Thank you.

27:25.132 --> 27:26.261
Tom?

28:27.722 --> 28:29.121
Tom!

28:31.052 --> 28:32.501
Hey!

28:33.912 --> 28:36.161
He said... he said he
felt like killing himself.

28:36.162 --> 28:38.831
And there was a taxi outside and
if I didn't get in it, he would.

28:40.942 --> 28:42.111
OK.

28:42.112 --> 28:44.038
Tom, go up the bank.

28:46.519 --> 28:49.148
- Mum...
- To the top, where it's safer.

28:53.879 --> 28:58.198
God, Simon. If a car hits you,
then it could kill them, too.

29:00.399 --> 29:02.878
Jesus. Simon, please. Just...

29:02.879 --> 29:04.848
Just come away from the traffic!

29:04.849 --> 29:06.258
Please...

29:07.239 --> 29:08.878
We can talk.

29:10.379 --> 29:12.958
I wanted to talk to him, but
even when I'm feeling like this

29:12.959 --> 29:17.088
he went at me. Now he's
just watching his shit dad.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.708
Yes, and if a car hits you, what
he sees will scar him forever.

29:19.709 --> 29:21.398
Don't argue with me!

29:21.399 --> 29:23.809
All right. But now it has.

29:23.810 --> 29:25.998
You can't stop arguing
with me, contradicting me.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.507
- Let go of me.
- Jesus, Simon!

29:29.508 --> 29:31.298
- Mum!
- Tom, no!

29:32.499 --> 29:34.008
Simon, please.

29:40.059 --> 29:43.198
OK. Look, we can talk.

29:46.199 --> 29:48.068
Look at me.

29:48.069 --> 29:49.388
Simon!

30:10.109 --> 30:11.368
Not like this.

30:12.919 --> 30:14.278
Not like this.

30:20.049 --> 30:22.198
Are you OK?

30:32.279 --> 30:33.548
Simon...

30:43.249 --> 30:44.608
What did you say?

30:44.649 --> 30:46.808
We're going to get some food.

30:46.809 --> 30:49.298
- Food?
- He said he wanted us to eat together.

30:49.299 --> 30:51.218
As a family and I...

30:52.489 --> 30:53.848
I said OK.

31:15.639 --> 31:17.138
Morning, how we all doing?

31:17.139 --> 31:18.548
Good, thanks.

31:18.589 --> 31:20.798
OK, excellent. Can I get
you any drinks to start?

31:20.799 --> 31:22.768
- Coffee?
- Just some water.

31:22.769 --> 31:24.648
- Jolly good. Sir?
- A beer.

31:25.819 --> 31:27.408
You... Sure?

31:27.409 --> 31:30.508
- Um, we have...
- Actually, could you do a whiskey and Coke?

31:30.509 --> 31:31.858
Absolutely. Jack Daniel's?

31:31.859 --> 31:34.348
- Jack Daniel's.
- All righty.

31:34.349 --> 31:35.798
We only have Pepsi, is that OK?

31:35.799 --> 31:37.858
Double. Double whiskey and Coke.

31:37.859 --> 31:41.048
No problem, I'll be back in a
moment to take your food order.

31:47.849 --> 31:49.578
Where are you going to go?

31:53.659 --> 31:55.068
Back to London?

31:56.899 --> 31:58.258
Maybe.

32:00.929 --> 32:02.428
You never liked it there.

32:05.239 --> 32:06.408
No.

32:07.399 --> 32:09.318
You'll sort stuff out, you will.

32:09.319 --> 32:11.098
You know people, you'll find a job.

32:11.099 --> 32:12.978
And you'll find somewhere to stay.

32:14.479 --> 32:16.208
You hate us anyway, so...

32:16.209 --> 32:17.568
I don't hate you.

32:21.039 --> 32:24.418
Kate's just angry. I'm sure you'll
be able to see Amelie eventually.

32:27.129 --> 32:28.448
I don't think so, mate.

32:33.779 --> 32:37.308
Why did you want this? We're all
just sitting here feeling shit.

32:37.309 --> 32:39.928
What did you think was going to happen?

32:44.199 --> 32:46.208
Jack Daniel's and Pepsi.

32:47.999 --> 32:48.978
Water.

32:52.209 --> 32:53.758
Can I take your food order?

32:53.759 --> 32:55.398
Some toast.

32:55.399 --> 32:56.898
Any marmalade, jam?

32:56.899 --> 32:59.058
- Fine.
- Yeah, toast.

32:59.059 --> 33:01.168
Sir, some toast for you as well?

33:07.539 --> 33:09.228
Shall I come back in a moment?

33:11.339 --> 33:13.778
- Should I... ?
- He'll have an English breakfast.

33:15.279 --> 33:19.168
Poached egg, two bacon,
sausage and hash brown.

33:19.169 --> 33:21.188
And he'll want some English mustard.

33:22.499 --> 33:23.898
And some brown sauce, too.

33:23.899 --> 33:25.548
Sure.

33:36.189 --> 33:39.418
I hate myself. I hate what I've done.

33:39.419 --> 33:40.828
I hate the entire world.

33:40.829 --> 33:44.248
You've no idea. I hope you
never feel what I'm feeling now.

33:49.359 --> 33:51.138
Did he tell you what I said?

33:51.139 --> 33:53.198
Why he left you and went with me?

33:53.199 --> 33:55.078
- No.
- You want to know?

33:55.079 --> 33:57.518
- It doesn't matter.
- Look, Tom, she's desperate.

33:57.519 --> 33:59.348
She can't bear not knowing things.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.218
You thought about it so
much, you must have guessed.

34:04.219 --> 34:05.628
I worked it out yesterday.

34:05.629 --> 34:08.388
I assume you went back on
all the assurances YOU gave me

34:08.389 --> 34:10.498
that you would protect my
relationship with my son.

34:10.498 --> 34:13.217
It was important he knew what
you were capable of. Mum...

34:13.219 --> 34:14.527
I was depressed.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.974
I don't know if Dad mentioned the reason

34:21.975 --> 34:23.936
why I left you on your own as a baby,

34:23.958 --> 34:26.818
it was because I had
postnatal depression.

34:28.129 --> 34:29.438
But I got better.

34:30.789 --> 34:32.348
I assumed,

34:32.349 --> 34:34.408
even given everything,

34:34.409 --> 34:38.208
your dad understood the difference
between character and illness.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.158
It didn't occur to me that
he would tell you about it

34:41.159 --> 34:43.828
because I couldn't
imagine the psychology

34:43.829 --> 34:46.038
of someone who would do that.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.368
Who would hold that against you.

34:51.069 --> 34:52.808
- You wanted me dead.
- No.

34:52.809 --> 34:54.208
- But you said.
- I just...

34:54.208 --> 34:55.598
- I couldn't cope.
- Hoped I would die?

34:55.599 --> 34:57.238
- No!
- You did.

34:57.239 --> 34:58.928
- Simon!
- You've forgotten.

34:58.929 --> 35:00.658
You did say it and you meant it.

35:00.659 --> 35:03.898
I heard it at the time. I never
said anything and never reminded you.

35:03.899 --> 35:05.258
Until now.

35:05.259 --> 35:07.598
Dad said he had to quit his
career so he could look after me.

35:07.599 --> 35:09.288
His career? What career?!

35:09.289 --> 35:11.958
To let him stay at home so
you could work for the better.

35:11.959 --> 35:13.548
Oh, you just say things, don't you?

35:13.549 --> 35:15.148
That you preferred work to me.

35:15.149 --> 35:17.018
You want to stand by that now?

35:17.019 --> 35:18.708
But you do work a lot.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.908
I remember growing up,
you were always out.

35:20.909 --> 35:23.868
Even since Dad left, it's not like
you've tried to talk to me much.

35:23.869 --> 35:26.628
I mean, with your buildings and
more patients and more doctors,

35:26.629 --> 35:29.258
- and I think it's because...
- Because I believe in what I do!

35:29.259 --> 35:30.708
Because you want to avoid me!

35:30.709 --> 35:32.958
I'm good at what I do and I work hard.

35:35.069 --> 35:38.868
But I've also, despite everything,
been a good mum and I...

35:38.869 --> 35:41.118
I think, one day,

35:41.119 --> 35:42.758
you will realise that.

35:49.179 --> 35:50.958
I think the only way, Tom,

35:50.959 --> 35:54.198
that I have failed you is
in my choice of your father.

35:55.419 --> 35:59.348
And the fact that on that night
when I should have been helping you,

35:59.349 --> 36:02.208
I went back to him, and
I hate myself for that.

36:02.209 --> 36:05.028
I will regret it forever.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.698
At least I know that
I've always loved you.

36:12.719 --> 36:15.948
I've always tried to protect you.

36:15.949 --> 36:18.428
So if you want to hate me, you
hate me for the last two years,

36:18.429 --> 36:22.278
but before that, before your dad
broke it, I was a really good mum.

36:36.719 --> 36:38.028
Excuse me.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.608
- Mum!
- I'll be back in a minute. You stay here.

38:16.756 --> 38:18.535
It's done.

38:18.536 --> 38:19.945
As agreed.

38:19.946 --> 38:21.725
Thanks.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.365
What do you mean?

38:28.336 --> 38:29.795
I'm...

38:29.796 --> 38:32.325
paying for the room a few days.

38:32.326 --> 38:34.295
So your dad can...

38:34.296 --> 38:36.305
sort things out.

38:40.766 --> 38:42.075
So this is it.

38:43.246 --> 38:44.415
What?

38:51.776 --> 38:53.835
I'm never going to see you again.

38:57.916 --> 38:59.085
Live a good life.

39:00.356 --> 39:01.805
I'm...

39:04.246 --> 39:05.935
I'm really sorry for everything.

39:07.296 --> 39:08.555
You mum's right.

39:10.436 --> 39:12.265
All that stuff I said, I was angry.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.605
She didn't work too hard.

39:16.766 --> 39:19.055
I found it difficult to stay in one job.

39:20.326 --> 39:22.435
To put up with the boss, is the truth.

39:24.216 --> 39:26.885
She loves you so much,
she's never let you down.

39:28.486 --> 39:30.635
I'm the problem in our
family, I always have been,

39:30.636 --> 39:32.325
so you're absolutely right, Tom.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.815
You're so much better without me,

39:34.816 --> 39:36.545
and when I've gone...

39:37.856 --> 39:41.045
... I think you'll feel a bit
sad, but not for long. I think...

39:49.016 --> 39:52.535
When my dad died, I just felt relief.

39:52.536 --> 39:55.015
That I didn't have to
worry about him any more.

39:56.566 --> 39:57.994
That I didn't have to try to predict

39:57.995 --> 39:59.845
in what way he'd ruin my life next.

40:02.046 --> 40:06.075
When he died, I cried, but within
an hour, I felt so much better.

40:08.046 --> 40:10.725
That does happen, it can.

40:10.726 --> 40:12.685
I think you're going
to feel that about me.

40:14.006 --> 40:15.685
You're not going to die.

40:15.686 --> 40:18.405
Well, I might as well because
you're never going to see me again.

40:18.406 --> 40:21.975
That's what you want, isn't
it? You've had enough of me.

40:29.846 --> 40:31.445
You ought to be a doctor.

40:32.616 --> 40:34.155
Wh... what?

40:34.156 --> 40:35.655
It's a job.

40:35.656 --> 40:38.335
I thought you liked the idea
of being a doctor like your mum.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.865
Well, I don't know.

40:40.866 --> 40:42.975
You should. You'd be so good at it.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.095
Forget about me, I'm...

40:47.096 --> 40:49.065
I'm just shit, I'm...

40:49.066 --> 40:50.615
I'm really just shit.

40:56.526 --> 40:57.975
Enough?

41:17.196 --> 41:18.465
Bye, Dad.

41:23.526 --> 41:24.975
Bye, Tom.

41:30.276 --> 41:31.865
Follow the instructions.

44:10.086 --> 44:12.095
I just want to say a few things.

44:13.416 --> 44:15.705
Don't worry, I'm not
going to take this away.

44:15.706 --> 44:17.305
When I'm finished, do what you like.

44:17.306 --> 44:19.555
This is just some small print
that I need to get through.

44:19.556 --> 44:21.525
- I don't want to hear it.
- I don't care what you want.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.725
I'm the one who'll have to
live with our son in agony

44:23.726 --> 44:25.315
because his father killed himself.

44:25.316 --> 44:27.805
I'm the one he'll probably
blame for that his whole life,

44:27.806 --> 44:31.085
so I don't think that I'm out
of order trying to have my say.

44:34.276 --> 44:35.535
Sit down.

44:43.976 --> 44:47.255
After my parents died in the car crash,

44:47.256 --> 44:50.075
for a long time I just...
took that at its word.

44:51.436 --> 44:53.635
"Car crash" covers
quite a lot of things,

44:53.636 --> 44:57.435
and for some strange reason I wanted
to know how they actually died.

44:58.796 --> 45:01.975
They went under a lorry and the
roof of their car caved in on them

45:01.976 --> 45:03.435
and crushed their heads.

45:05.776 --> 45:08.825
It will have been utterly terrifying,

45:08.826 --> 45:10.835
incredibly painful,

45:10.836 --> 45:12.245
and not instant.

45:15.436 --> 45:17.635
I think that's why I became a doctor.

45:18.996 --> 45:21.715
Maybe if I'd been there, maybe
I could have done something.

45:21.716 --> 45:23.125
Probably not, but who knows?

45:25.656 --> 45:28.085
This won't be instant, either.

45:28.086 --> 45:30.625
Because there is no painless way to die.

45:31.746 --> 45:35.173
And the truth is, we don't
know exactly what it feels like,

45:35.174 --> 45:37.003
but we do know that it'll be nasty.

45:37.004 --> 45:39.723
And once you do it, you will be over.

45:39.724 --> 45:42.253
There is no coming
back, you will just stop.

45:49.704 --> 45:51.533
I thought about taking my own life.

45:53.594 --> 45:54.623
In the middle of...

45:55.704 --> 45:56.873
... everything.

45:56.874 --> 45:59.783
I left Tom with you, do you remember?

45:59.784 --> 46:02.033
You called me, I was by the sea.

46:02.034 --> 46:04.843
After I hung up on you,
I walked into the water.

46:06.724 --> 46:08.223
Because I wanted to drown.

46:09.914 --> 46:13.943
But I stopped myself because I
knew that it wasn't fair on Tom.

46:18.864 --> 46:21.673
I grew up without my
parents. I needed them and...

46:23.274 --> 46:24.863
... they weren't there.

46:31.804 --> 46:33.963
You know, a few days ago I thought...

46:35.554 --> 46:37.853
... maybe you can't help yourself.

46:37.854 --> 46:39.913
Everything that you've done.

46:39.914 --> 46:42.353
Maybe you have an illness of some kind.

46:42.354 --> 46:44.273
- I don't.
- No, I don't think you do.

46:45.724 --> 46:47.083
No excuses.

46:47.084 --> 46:48.863
Agreed.

46:50.794 --> 46:52.003
Either way...

46:55.474 --> 46:56.883
Don't do this.

46:59.464 --> 47:02.613
Tom doesn't realise it at
the moment, but he needs you.

47:03.864 --> 47:04.873
Then why did you...

47:07.014 --> 47:08.463
You were quick to offer THIS.

47:08.464 --> 47:10.473
I had to get you off that motorway.

47:10.474 --> 47:12.723
The thought was already there, you...

47:12.724 --> 47:15.073
You just happened to have
the right drugs in your bag?

47:15.074 --> 47:18.303
I put them in there
when you took Tom away.

47:19.714 --> 47:20.983
Just in case.

47:20.984 --> 47:22.523
What do you mean?

47:27.124 --> 47:28.523
A weapon, I suppose.

47:32.654 --> 47:34.483
I am never losing him.

47:37.904 --> 47:41.883
If you're desperate I don't do it,
why don't you take them away, then?

47:41.884 --> 47:43.813
Because you nearly caused a car crash,

47:43.814 --> 47:46.433
- at least this way you'll only kill yourself.
- Do you forgive me?

47:49.484 --> 47:51.073
I won't ever forgive you.

47:54.174 --> 47:57.313
But we will both
probably start to forget.

48:02.884 --> 48:04.293
And that's enough.

48:15.404 --> 48:16.533
Simon.

48:38.514 --> 48:40.113
Don't do this.

48:57.364 --> 48:59.333
The offer's still there?

48:59.334 --> 49:01.533
A few days to get back on my feet.

49:06.504 --> 49:07.953
Then take them.

49:07.954 --> 49:09.593
- What?
- Take them.

49:09.594 --> 49:11.003
Take them with you.

49:33.494 --> 49:35.003
Bye, Simon.

49:37.114 --> 49:38.333
Bye.

50:07.304 --> 50:08.293
Hey!

50:09.504 --> 50:10.963
- Wait.
- Oh...

50:12.184 --> 50:14.713
Oh, thanks. Never without that.

50:32.104 --> 50:33.883
Doctor Angeles?

50:36.234 --> 50:37.633
You wanted your bill.

50:40.264 --> 50:41.523
Thanks.

50:41.524 --> 50:44.383
Could you put my card on
file? I'll pay for the week.

50:44.424 --> 50:45.743
Sure.

50:50.014 --> 50:52.073
You have three new messages.

50:52.074 --> 50:53.953
First new message.

50:53.954 --> 50:55.453
Gemma, it's Karen.

50:55.454 --> 50:57.793
The governors have upheld your appeal.

50:57.794 --> 50:59.663
If you could give me a call,

50:59.664 --> 51:03.463
we can talk about how and when Tom
should come back to school. Thanks.

51:03.464 --> 51:07.403
Message deleted. You
have two new messages.

51:07.404 --> 51:09.093
Next new message.

51:09.094 --> 51:11.153
Gemma, hi, it's Sian.

51:11.154 --> 51:13.873
I hear you're coming back
and I just wanted to say

51:13.874 --> 51:16.123
that I'm really pleased
it's all sorted out.

51:16.124 --> 51:19.313
When you're ready, call me and
maybe we can go for a drink.

51:19.314 --> 51:20.953
OK, bye.

51:20.954 --> 51:23.063
Message deleted.

51:24.744 --> 51:27.603
You have one new message.

51:27.604 --> 51:29.013
Next message...

51:43.404 --> 51:45.970
_

51:59.674 --> 52:02.673
And the moment the blood
rushes down out of your head...

52:06.334 --> 52:07.833
... it's like suddenly falling,

52:07.834 --> 52:09.983
like something giving way.

52:14.064 --> 52:16.313
It's not like shock.

52:16.314 --> 52:18.943
Because there's the horror
that somehow you knew...

52:20.394 --> 52:22.453
... underneath,

52:22.454 --> 52:23.913
without realising.

52:25.594 --> 52:27.943
The horror that this
terrible thing was there.

52:29.634 --> 52:31.973
Obvious the whole time,

52:31.974 --> 52:33.473
and you didn't see it.

52:35.024 --> 52:36.473
Tom!

52:43.784 --> 52:45.523
Hi. Excuse me?

52:46.644 --> 52:48.193
Have you seen my son?

52:48.194 --> 52:49.883
I've lost my son.

52:49.884 --> 52:51.523
His name's Tom, he's... He's 15.

52:51.524 --> 52:52.833
No, we haven't seen him.

52:52.834 --> 52:55.603
Go and stand back up the bank.
We'll attend to you in a minute.

52:55.604 --> 52:59.583
And you know that now there's no repair.

53:00.754 --> 53:02.213
No going back.

53:02.214 --> 53:04.083
Whatever life you had,

53:04.084 --> 53:07.223
whatever fight you thought was
important, now looks so naive.

53:07.224 --> 53:09.893
Mum, I'm going.

53:09.894 --> 53:13.603
I was going to move out anyway,
but I've had enough of Dad and you,

53:13.604 --> 53:15.333
and not knowing, and...

53:15.334 --> 53:18.003
I've got no school, no friends left.

53:18.004 --> 53:21.383
I hate myself. I just
want to start again.

53:21.384 --> 53:24.103
You went off at 17, you did all right.

53:25.324 --> 53:26.913
You won't see me again.

53:28.694 --> 53:30.663
It'll be better, I think.

53:34.884 --> 53:36.103
Love you.

54:32.594 --> 54:34.653
What you thought had been the fight

54:34.654 --> 54:36.483
was merely the warning.

54:47.124 --> 54:50.313
Your biggest fear was
nothing compared to this.

54:52.814 --> 54:56.314
_

54:57.344 --> 55:00.253
The weeks go past and people
say it will get better...

55:02.224 --> 55:03.673
... but it doesn't.

55:06.434 --> 55:10.233
You do everything anyone could,
but somehow you know it's done.

55:10.234 --> 55:12.113
It's happened. Too late.

55:13.424 --> 55:14.783
He's gone.

55:18.784 --> 55:20.770
_

55:24.534 --> 55:27.533
You go over the past, what
you did, what you said.

55:27.534 --> 55:30.203
Again and again and again.

55:32.174 --> 55:33.763
What should you have done?

55:39.674 --> 55:42.023
Did you get it wrong from the start?

55:44.034 --> 55:45.583
Hello, Mrs Roberts...

55:56.504 --> 55:58.333
You'll never stop going over it.

55:59.694 --> 56:02.173
And in the end, all you can say is...

56:03.024 --> 56:04.193
I'm here.

56:05.784 --> 56:07.613
Tom, I'm your mum.

56:08.974 --> 56:09.984
I'm sorry

56:11.085 --> 56:12.584
and I'm here.

56:14.975 --> 56:16.804
I'll always be here waiting.

56:18.255 --> 56:19.844
When you want to come back.

56:22.665 --> 56:24.864
Whenever you want to come back.
