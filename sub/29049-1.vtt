Everything's gonna be ok
now, honey.

all the clues.

Get out of the van, Susan!

01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:04.125
You just couldn't stay at home

01:24:04.126 --> 01:24:06.832
and do something helpful
like overdose.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:09.249
You had to make this difficult.

Why?

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.875
For the money.

01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:18.540
And to avoid prison.

01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:20.333
This was never personal.
