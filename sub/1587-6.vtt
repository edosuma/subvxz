Please, sit.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.626
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.211
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,

04:14.838 --> 04:16.422
King of the Andals and the First Men,

04:16.506 --> 04:19.175

04:23.513 --> 04:27.350

04:32.773 --> 04:34.690
He shares no blood with me.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.361
He is a bastard born of incest.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.280
-As was his brother before him.
-Yes.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.782
We have heard this story.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.534
lt's not a story. lt's the truth.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.538
The king's grandfather tells a different story.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.290
A story about a jealous uncle

04:51.375 --> 04:53.960
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

04:54.044 --> 04:55.836
cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly

04:56.046 --> 04:58.547
in blood and gold.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.341
Gold you loaned him.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.470
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.181
More than any man living.

05:07.307 --> 05:12.478
Across the Narrow Sea, your books are
filled with words like "usurper"

05:12.562 --> 05:15.898
and "madman" and "blood right."

05:16.400 --> 05:19.110
Here, our books are filled with numbers.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.696
We prefer the stories they tell.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.656
More plain.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.993
Less open to interpretation.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.206
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.499
4,000.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.418
And how many ships do you have?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.503
-DAVOS: Uh...
-The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.922
not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.677
-(CLEARS THROAT) Thirty-two.
-And how much wheat and barley

05:44.761 --> 05:47.638
and beef and pork
do you produce on Dragonstone

05:47.723 --> 05:52.476
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.688
None.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.901
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

06:00.986 --> 06:02.278
from our perspective.

06:03.947 --> 06:08.617
l'm afraid
we must respectfully decline your request.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.288
But we thank you for
paying us the honour of your visit.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.760
-DAVOS: My lord.
-l'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.511
You would not be either here.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.930
ln Braavos,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.641

06:32.934 --> 06:34.351
l didn't do the thieving.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.062
That would be the pirates.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.315
l just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.195
This is the payment that was demanded
by King Stannis for my crimes.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.655
l consider it an honest accounting.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.200
He's an honest man and he's your best chance

06:49.284 --> 06:51.035
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.371
Which is a lot. Wars are expensive.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.084
-The war is over.
-As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.920
Who's the real power in King's Landing?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.671
-Ser Davos...
-Humour me.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.175
-Tywin Lannister.
-How old is Tywin Lannister?

07:06.343 --> 07:07.301
Sixty-seven.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.346
And when he dies, who's in command?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.764
A half-grown boy,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.599
the product of incest?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.727
Cersei Lannister,
a queen whose people despise her?

07:16.812 --> 07:17.812
Jaime Lannister,

07:17.896 --> 07:21.816
a man best known for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?

07:22.317 --> 07:25.486
When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.114
That is a problem for another time.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.617
l think it's a problem for now.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.453
There's only one reliable leader left
in Westeros.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.539
Stannis.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.165
He's got the birthright.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.167
He's in his prime.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.294
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.589
And he doesn't just talk about
paying people back, he does it.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.930
SALLADHOR: The lookout sees a pirate ship
sailing their way.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.015
The captain shouts to his first mate,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.934
"Bring me my red shirt."

07:57.018 --> 07:59.812
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.564
And when the pirates try to board,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.649
the brave captain leads his men to victory.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.570
A few days later, the lookout screams,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.488
"Two pirate ships!"

08:09.573 --> 08:13.492
The crew is shivering like scared mice.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.369
But the courageous captain hollers,

08:15.453 --> 08:17.204
"Bring me my red shirt!"

08:17.289 --> 08:19.373
After the battle, the first mate asks,

08:19.457 --> 08:23.169
"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt
before battle?"

08:23.253 --> 08:24.879
The captain replies,

08:24.963 --> 08:28.632
"So that if l am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

08:28.717 --> 08:31.427
The next morning the lookout screams,

08:31.511 --> 08:35.264
"Ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"

08:36.183 --> 08:38.142
The crew goes silent.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.686

08:40.770 --> 08:42.771
