01:29.120 --> 01:31.350
Peg, it's getting kind of late.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.949
Shouldn't you be getting to bed?

01:34.680 --> 01:36.671
I'm not going to sleep without you.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.475
We haven't been to bed
at the same time in 10 years.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.589
And you notice we haven't had
any more children in 10 years.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.875
So I must be doing something right.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.039
Honey, just because
we had kids...

01:50.240 --> 01:53.869
...doesn't mean you were doing
anything right back then either.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.357
You're sexy
when you neuter me that way.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.353
Oh, come on, Al.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.516
We could have fun
going to bed together.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.314
You know, doing those things
we used to do.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.115
Like you rubbing my tushy
till I go to sleep.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.637
Oh, that's what we can do, honey.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.068
Oh, come on.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.795
My tushy is yearning for you.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.670
<i>I wanna be rubbed by you</i>

02:25.640 --> 02:30.953
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

02:31.200 --> 02:32.679
Peg, I wouldn't rub your tushy...

02:32.880 --> 02:36.156
...if Robin Williams popped out of it
and offered me three wishes.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.952
Well, I'm not going to sleep
without you.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.756
You know, Peg, I'm...

02:52.960 --> 02:56.270
I'm a little worried about you.
You look exhausted.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.472
Now, did you have those lines
in your face this morning?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.990
Breaks my heart, Peg.
You look 100.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.917
Why don't you get
a good night's sleep...

03:06.120 --> 03:09.476
...and you'll wake up looking
not a day older than my grandmother.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.510
Oh, my God,
we stayed up till dawn.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.557
Hey, why are you two up
at the same time?

03:24.760 --> 03:26.637
Oh, I know. Don't tell me.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.274
Bud had a nightmare
and he crawled into your bed...

03:29.480 --> 03:31.391
...and he went potty.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.273
Honey, Bud is 20 years old,
and it's Saturday night.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.675
Now, you know very well
that he's fast asleep...

03:37.880 --> 03:40.348
<i>...and has been since 8:00.</i>

03:42.160 --> 03:45.994
Oh, and by the way, Al, did you go in
and turn off his flashlight?

03:46.680 --> 03:48.875
I wouldn't stick my hand
under those covers.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.752
- Oh, my God.
- If you know what I mean.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.555
Now, now. Let's just keep it down.
We don't wanna wake him up.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.752
He'll come down
and wanna talk about his problems.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.357
Hey. Bud was out
on a Saturday night.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.834
How did it go, son?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.317
Oh, Bud.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.512
It's 3 a. m.
You must have something to tell us.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.349
Yes, Bud,
tell us of your travels in lonely land.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.238
Well, aging maritime toy...

04:29.520 --> 04:31.272
...I went where all cool guys go.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.436
I headed to the Chippendales
parking lot...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.995
...and waited for the horny old ladies
to come out.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.434
Then I took off my shirt
and start gyrating under a lamppost.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.789
Did you get any, son?

04:45.040 --> 04:49.591
Yup. A face full of Mace
and a spinning back-kick to the groin.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.799
But I think on the way down...

04:53.000 --> 04:55.958
...I did manage to get
a fistful of withered heinie.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.917
- Al, give Bud a high-five.
- No, I can't do it, Peg.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.396
If I could fake it that good,
we'd be upstairs right now.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.468
All right. Here's the plan.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.717
Bud will be home soon.
When he comes in...

05:13.920 --> 05:16.036
...we are gonna pretend
that it's Sunday night.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.629
That way when he has no date,
he won't feel bad.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.990
You know, because everyone
stays home on Sunday.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.431
- Even cool people like us.
- Yeah.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.432
Look, why don't we just get him
some starving Third World babe.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.393
You know, like a mail-order bride.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.511
If we stuff her with burgers,
she might even stay for a week.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.633
I mean, how long do you
really want one anyway?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.915
Well, why can't we just
let it happen naturally?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.838
Some people are just late bloomers.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.349
I myself was a late bloomer.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.916
Well, whatever bloomed
must have got picked...

05:59.520 --> 06:03.035
...because I'm looking at
some mighty arid country.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.516
Al, we are talking about our son.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.190
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I was looking at him.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.632
Al, you've got a dilemma.
We're pretending it's Sunday...

06:20.840 --> 06:23.912
...so theoretically you should be
changing your underwear.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.434
Oh, or is this the week
you turn it inside out...

06:28.640 --> 06:30.790
...and wear the clean side?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.753
It's a big decision...

06:35.960 --> 06:39.032
...because it also involves
taking off your shoes.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.391
All right, come on, honey.
Now, look like it's Sunday.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.628
That's right.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.150
That says Sunday
better than skipping church.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.592
Where's Bud? I wanted to tell him
that I've got a big date tonight.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.268
I love ruining his Saturday nights.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.755
Oh, my God, it's Sunday?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.398
I've gotta be at work.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.909
How did I lose a day?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.790
I must have magnesia.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.072
What did Gilligan do
when he had magnesia?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.276
Oh, my God, I don't remember.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.189
Gadzooks, I'm losing
my short-term mammaries.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.078
What's going on?

07:52.280 --> 07:56.831
The old " let's convince Bud it's Sunday
to mask his shame" routine?

07:57.800 --> 08:01.236
Well, Dad, before you hurriedly
change your underwear...

08:01.440 --> 08:03.237
...I think you guys
should meet my date.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.475
Why, she's just lovely, isn't she?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.678
She must really like you, Bud...

08:13.880 --> 08:16.235
...going out on a Sunday and all.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.989
No need taking chances, eh, Bud?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.836
Look, you morons...

08:25.040 --> 08:27.349
...this is not another imaginary date.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.154
<i>I was gonna turn on the TV.
That's where you'll see her.</i>

08:30.720 --> 08:34.759
He had it bad for Ginger,
but now he likes Mary Ann.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.357
Hush, fossils, and watch.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.517
Thank you. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Adam Gold.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.792
I'll bet my natural mother's sorry
she put me up for adoption now...

08:53.000 --> 08:54.274
...aren't you, Mom?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.799
<i>Thank you.
Anyway, welcome to You Can't Missl...</i>

08:58.000 --> 09:01.913
...the show that guarantees that one of
our manly contestants can't miss.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.076
So let's meet the guys.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.558
<i>Remember the rules: Only guys who've
had sex two times or less are eligible.</i>

09:17.720 --> 09:19.312
How can we prove it?

09:19.520 --> 09:22.512
Well, wait till you see them.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.633
Let's meet our first hunk.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.910
He's a crossing guard
from Skokie, lllinois...

09:28.120 --> 09:29.792
...Henry Fudderman.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.992
Henry, tell us how many times
you've scored.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.876
- Once.
- Okay, once.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.839
Let's meet our next hunk.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.476
He's a movie usher from Baraboo,
Wisconsin. Eugene Smelt.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.192
Eugene, tell us how many times
you've done the deed.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.195
One and a half, Adam.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.518
But I'm not sure about the one.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.111
Okay, Eugene.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.596
And our final he-man
is an A student from Chicago...

10:12.800 --> 10:16.270
...and the only one of our hunks
who still lives at home. Bud Bundy.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.830
Okay, Bud, fill us in.
How many times have you had sex?

10:26.400 --> 10:29.358
With actual people?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.709
Two, Adam.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.670
On the show
they actually believed that.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.588
Welcome back to the show.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.836
And now it's time
to meet tonight's tramp.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.349
Say hi to Candy Lapinski.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.834
Hi, Candy,
it's great to have you with us.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.792
Yeah, right.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.718
Now, the rules to our show
are as easy as Candy.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.470
After a brief
question-and-answer period...

11:20.680 --> 11:23.513
...Candy will select a date
from among our three stallions.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.513
For you viewers who may be wondering
why a woman like this...

11:26.720 --> 11:29.792
<i>...would go out with one of these
losers, the answer is very simple:</i>

11:30.000 --> 11:32.673
We give her a $1000.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.272
And next week,
after her dream date...

11:35.480 --> 11:39.029
...she'll have the opportunity to go to
Bermuda with one of our three nerds...

11:39.240 --> 11:41.595
...or our very own Rodrigo.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.795
I love you all.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.231
Okay, Candy, it's question time.
Now, what is your first question?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.473
Number one...

11:59.680 --> 12:01.875
...how would you build
the perfect woman?

12:03.160 --> 12:07.119
Let's see.
She'd have my mother's eyes...

12:07.320 --> 12:10.710
...and my mother's breasts
and my father's-

12:10.960 --> 12:13.155
Yucko.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.914
Number two?

12:15.480 --> 12:18.278
I already have built
the perfect woman...

12:18.480 --> 12:20.914
...out of gummy bears.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.348
You wanna see?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.039
- Number three?
- Well, Candy...

12:26.240 --> 12:28.993
...as far as I'm concerned,
you are the perfect woman...

12:29.200 --> 12:30.838
...and I'm the perfect man.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.792
So, what say we cut
the preliminaries...

12:33.000 --> 12:36.390
...and create the perfect
simultaneous big-O.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.152
Well, Candy,
what do you think about that?

12:42.360 --> 12:44.555
Can I see Rodrigo again?

12:53.080 --> 12:54.911
And that means we're out of time.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.669
So it's decision time for you, Candy.
Who's it gonna be?

12:58.920 --> 13:01.115
Hunk-a-rama number one...

13:02.040 --> 13:04.031
...number two...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.870
...or number three?

13:07.560 --> 13:10.552
- Number three.
- Yes!

13:12.360 --> 13:16.672
Candy, meet your date, Bud Bundy.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.398
Dad, look where I am.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.234
Like I give a damn what you think.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.155
I've got a date with her
next Saturday night...

13:40.360 --> 13:42.430
...and you'll be with each other.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.153
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.113
I'm late for work. Oh, God.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.869
Listen, if my boss calls,
for God's sakes...

13:54.080 --> 13:57.470
...don't tell him I forgot what day it was.
I don't wanna get a stupid rep.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.035
It's not good for my image
as a waitress.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.789
You know, I wish somebody would think
to write down all the days in a row...

14:04.000 --> 14:06.719
...on a big piece of paper
so you know what day it is.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.429
You know, maybe even
put the month on it, you know...

14:11.640 --> 14:14.154
...like a calendar or something.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.278
Come to bed, Al.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.994
We haven't slept for days.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.590
I am not going...

14:46.160 --> 14:48.674
...to bed unless you go with me.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.953
And you, my friend,
are getting sleepy.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.958
Look how heavy
those eyelids are getting.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.596
It won't work, Peg.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.791
Because much like
the rest of your body...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.197
...your lids are drooping
more than mine.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.438
You're drifting.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.996
You're getting sleepy.

15:29.600 --> 15:33.149
This has been the worst Sunday
of my life.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.639
And Wednesday,
which I thought was Tuesday...

15:36.840 --> 15:39.035
...was no picnic either.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.277
I'm telling you, something's up.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.708
It's Sunday...

15:44.680 --> 15:46.671
...but I saw the mailman.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.950
So I picked up a newspaper.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.230
Said it was Saturday.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.793
I got suspicious, so I went to church.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.391
Nobody was there.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.998
Which makes me think I'm right.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.236
It is Sunday.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.550
<i>And yet, Meet The Press,
which I watch religiously, wasn't on.</i>

16:12.760 --> 16:15.832
I'm telling you,
it's a giant conspiracy.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.828
You know, like who killed
that movie president guy, JFK.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.032
The church. The feds. The networks.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.674
They're all in on it.
But I'll get them.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.950
<i>The same way J. Edgar Hoover
got everybody:</i>

16:35.160 --> 16:37.549
By wearing a red dress.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.554
Well, I'm back from
my game-show date.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.276
Did you get any, son?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.753
No.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.518
But I'll be getting plenty soon...

16:54.720 --> 16:58.349
...because it'll be me and Candy
on the dandy, sandy Caribbean.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.915
All that's left is we have to go back
on the show...

17:01.120 --> 17:05.079
...and she chooses between me
and that latent Latin, Rodrigo.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.872
Honey, I have been chosen
to sensitively broach the question...

17:19.079 --> 17:21.116
<i>...which is on all our lips:</i>

17:21.319 --> 17:24.596
What on God's green earth
would make you think that anyone...

17:24.800 --> 17:28.998
...including your mother,
would choose you over Rodrigo?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.672
I'd choose Rodrigo.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.115
Hell, I'd choose Rodrigo.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.398
Hell, I'd choose Rodrigo
over your mother.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.468
<i>And now,
welcome to You Can't Miss!.</i>

17:56.040 --> 17:58.918
Hey, this isn't supposed to be
on tonight.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.075
Well, I'll just write them down
in my conspiracy book...

18:04.640 --> 18:08.315
...right after Robin Leach.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.913
Hi again, I'm Adam Gold...

18:10.120 --> 18:13.510
...and we're here to see something
we've waited a whole week to find out.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.190
Who will huge-knockered airhead
Candy Lapinski...

18:17.400 --> 18:18.833
...pick for her pleasure cruise?

18:19.040 --> 18:22.794
Bud Bundy
or our own beautiful Rodrigo?

18:35.560 --> 18:38.632
Yeah, there's a tough call,
huh, folks?

18:38.920 --> 18:40.797
Candy, haul it on out here for us.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.392
Candy, you make a lovely couple.

18:50.640 --> 18:54.189
- Candy, you remember Bud.
- No.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.478
Okay, Bud, good luck to you.
And, Candy, your choice please...

18:57.680 --> 18:59.989
...and you and Rodrigo
can be off to the Caribbean.

19:02.120 --> 19:06.989
Hold your lousy consolation prize,
you poor man's Chuck Woolery.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.750
Now, before the lovely Candy
makes her decision...

19:13.960 --> 19:15.951
...I have something to say to her.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.755
Well, talk about
the little engine that could.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.068
Well, go for it, big guy.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.795
But remember, no woman
has ever not chosen Rodrigo.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.072
Enough, crones.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.475
You too, Mom.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.716
<i>Candy, this is all I have to say:</i>

19:40.920 --> 19:43.514
Let's talk about women
and the wrong choices they make.

19:43.720 --> 19:47.076
This is the wrong choice...

19:47.720 --> 19:49.472
...and I'll tell you why.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.478
He'll treat you like dirt.
He'll disappear for days.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.035
He'll lie to you. He'll cheat on you.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.152
Everything I would do
if I looked like him.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.510
But I'm here for the duration, baby.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.392
And the best thing about me is...

20:02.600 --> 20:05.990
...I've never had anybody
as good as you. He has.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.278
You know I haven't.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.710
You don't have to worry about
where I've been...

20:12.920 --> 20:15.195
...because I'm a two-time-or-less.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.628
It's up to you.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.354
Two minutes with a god
who will dump you...

20:19.560 --> 20:23.439
...or a lifetime with a guy
who will worship you as a goddess.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.359
Your choice is clear.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.910
I'll take Rodrigo.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.438
Enjoy your car wax, punk.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.437
Hey. Who wants to see
some of my car wax?

20:55.640 --> 20:59.633
I won it for making an ass out of myself
in front of 20 million people.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.558
Cool, huh?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.758
Bud, I can't believe it.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.235
You've got messages. From girls.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.668
A whole bunch. Look.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.835
<i>You were so pathetic on TV
that you actually touched people.</i>

21:12.560 --> 21:15.313
Pretty girls all over town
want you bad.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.388
- Bud.
- Choose me.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.957
<i>Hi, Bud. I saw you on TV.</i>

21:29.160 --> 21:30.752
- Choose me.
- No.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.839
Choose me and I'll hurt you
more than any of these girls.

21:35.640 --> 21:41.158
Wait. It's not just women
who make the wrong choices.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.396
I think you're gorgeous.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.115
You're my Rodrigo. Choose me.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.756
She'll hurt you.
I'll be good to you.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.838
She'll cheat on you.
I'll be faithful.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.632
She'll spend your money.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.638
You can spend mine.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.751
I'll worship you...

22:00.960 --> 22:04.999
...because I know how great you are
inside and out.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.590
What's your choice?

22:15.520 --> 22:17.158
Let's go.
