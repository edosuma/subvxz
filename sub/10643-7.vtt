11:22.848 --> 11:24.475
{\an1}Like I'm like--I'm feeling good,

11:24.558 --> 11:26.310
{\an1}going crazy.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.186
{\an1}We didn't end up leaving 'til

11:27.269 --> 11:29.188
{\an1}probably like 3:45 in the

11:29.271 --> 11:30.189
{\an1}morning.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.107
{\an1}So we jump on the bus to head

11:31.190 --> 11:32.817
{\an1}back to our resort.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.151
{\an1}Brandon, we're like Batman and

11:34.235 --> 11:35.236
{\an1}Robin.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.445
{\an1}Like MJ and Pippin.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.071
{\an1}We're not ready to call it a

11:37.154 --> 11:38.447
{\an1}night yet.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.032
{\an1}So where the bus dropped us off

11:40.116 --> 11:41.325
{\an1}at, there's a lagoon.

11:41.409 --> 11:41.951
{\an1}I look at him, and I'm like, "I

11:42.034 --> 11:44.286
{\an1}got something we could do."

11:44.370 --> 11:45.162
{\an1}"Okay."

11:45.246 --> 11:45.955
{\an1}"I bet you won't jump into the

11:46.038 --> 11:47.123
{\an1}lagoon."

11:47.206 --> 11:48.374
{\an1}"I mean, I guess."

11:48.457 --> 11:49.208
{\an1}He takes his shirt off, takes

11:49.291 --> 11:50.376
{\an1}his pants off.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.460
{\an1}He runs, and he jumps off this

11:51.544 --> 11:51.669
{\an1}deck.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
{\an1}And in the background, you could

11:53.504 --> 11:54.547
{\an1}hear one of the workers from the

11:54.630 --> 11:57.675
{\an1}resort, "Don't jump!

11:57.758 --> 12:00.469
{\an1}Crocodillo!"

12:00.553 --> 12:01.887
{\an1}I'm waiting to hear water.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.849
{\an1}And all I heard was like a thud.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.352
{\an1}I [bleep] you not, he lands on

12:08.436 --> 12:09.645
{\an1}top of a crocodile.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.148
{\an1}So he jumps off that one, lands

12:12.231 --> 12:14.316
{\an1}onto another crocodile.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.986
{\an1}And he just starts screaming.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.905
{\an1}"James! James! Ah!"

12:19.989 --> 12:21.740
{\an1}I go like Crocodile Dundee.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.325
{\an1}I grabbed his hands, pull his

12:23.409 --> 12:24.452
{\an1}waist out.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.037
{\an1}And I kid you not...there is a

12:27.121 --> 12:28.622
{\an1}crocodile attached to my

12:28.706 --> 12:30.124
{\an1}friend's leg.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.418
{\an1}"James! Help!

12:32.501 --> 12:33.752
{\an1}Get me out here!"

12:33.836 --> 12:34.670
{\an1}So I'm wailing this freaking

12:34.753 --> 12:37.173
{\an1}crocodile in the face.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.008
{\an1}"James! James!"

12:39.091 --> 12:39.717
{\an1}I'm hitting this thing.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.926
{\an1}It felt like I was hitting like

12:41.010 --> 12:43.012
{\an1}a scaly tree trunk.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.306
{\an1}"Ah-ah! Ah! James!"

12:45.389 --> 12:46.557
{\an1}And I'm giving it everything

12:46.640 --> 12:48.142
{\an1}I've got, punching it in its

12:48.225 --> 12:49.393
{\an1}face.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.729
{\an1}And finally let go.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.857
{\an1}"Damn, crocodillos."

12:54.940 --> 12:56.525
{\an1}Big ass croc, he swims away.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.318
{\an1}I pull the rest of my friend

12:57.401 --> 12:58.027
{\an1}out.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.861
{\an1}He had a big gash across his

12:58.944 --> 13:00.029
{\an1}chest.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.363
{\an1}One of the workers that yelled

13:01.447 --> 13:03.782
{\an1}"Don't jump," he comes running

13:03.866 --> 13:05.034
{\an1}over to us.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.994
{\an1}He said, underneath this breath,

13:07.077 --> 13:09.914
{\an1}"Americanos, stupidos.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.416
{\an1}Stupid."

13:12.500 --> 13:14.627
{\an1}So we ended our vacation in a

13:14.710 --> 13:16.670
{\an1}Mexican hospital.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.797
{\an1}I still like--I still get chills

14:11.725 --> 14:15.688

14:27.032 --> 14:27.992
{\an1}Everything crashed.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.326

14:50.931 --> 14:51.974
{\an1}Like "Yeah, come on."

14:52.057 --> 14:52.516
{\an1}So we're walking down the

14:55.477 --> 14:57.730

15:34.975 --> 15:36.060

{\an1}"Myleeza, do you guys wanna go

15:44.068 --> 15:45.069
{\an1}Uh.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.279

15:53.285 --> 15:55.913

15:58.082 --> 15:58.957

15:59.041 --> 15:59.833
{\an1}"Myleeza, we have to take a

15:59.917 --> 16:01.126

16:01.210 --> 16:02.252
{\an1}And I'm like, "Aaaah!

16:02.336 --> 16:03.087

16:03.170 --> 16:04.630

16:04.713 --> 16:06.048

16:10.260 --> 16:10.928
{\an1}like this.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.346
{\an1}And I can remember the smell of

16:12.429 --> 16:13.138
{\an1}her hair.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.556
{\an1}It wasn't a distinct smell, but

16:14.640 --> 16:15.849
{\an1}it smell expensive.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.475
{\an1}And I'm like, "Kim, thank you so

16:16.558 --> 16:18.060

16:23.732 --> 16:25.067

16:26.860 --> 16:29.071
{\an1}She sent me this shirt, which I

16:29.154 --> 16:30.781
{\an1}try not to wear every day.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.950

{\an1}Halle Berry, you know, after a

17:08.193 --> 17:09.319
{\an1}certain amount of time.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.529
{\an1}So it's like, I'm up here on my

17:10.612 --> 17:11.613
{\an1}lonesome.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.073
{\an1}I need to--need to find somebody

17:13.156 --> 17:14.324
{\an1}to chill with.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.117
{\an1}It was couple girls who I had my

17:15.200 --> 17:15.367
{\an1}eye on.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.786
{\an1}One was from the Ukraine.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.872
{\an1}And, uh, we're in the lodge.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.290
{\an1}We was having a conversation.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.290
{\an1}And I was like, "Man, I could

17:22.374 --> 17:23.416
{\an1}outrun a bear."

17:23.500 --> 17:24.209
{\an1}"Have you ever seen a black bear

17:24.292 --> 17:25.586
{\an1}run?"

17:25.669 --> 17:26.377
{\an1}"Man, you all haven't seen a

17:26.462 --> 17:27.588
{\an1}"black dude run before.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.422
{\an1}"You know, I could really outrun

17:28.505 --> 17:29.590
{\an1}a bear."

17:29.673 --> 17:30.382
{\an1}"Well your daddy is mixed, you

17:30.466 --> 17:31.467
{\an1}barely even count."

17:31.550 --> 17:32.926
{\an1}"No, given the opportunity, I

17:33.010 --> 17:33.343
{\an1}"can outrun a bear.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.887
{\an1}Trust me."

17:34.970 --> 17:36.722
{\an1}The next day passes, the girl,

17:36.805 --> 17:37.556
{\an1}like, she was throwing me the

17:37.639 --> 17:38.182
{\an1}flavor.

17:38.265 --> 17:38.599
{\an1}She was eyeing me.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.559
{\an1}"Hey, Z."

17:40.642 --> 17:41.643
{\an1}Like it was kinda something

17:41.727 --> 17:43.312
{\an1}different about her, you know?

17:43.395 --> 17:44.897
{\an1}She had an accent.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.856
{\an1}And I was really like feeling

17:45.939 --> 17:47.274
{\an1}the accent.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.609
{\an1}"I think we should hang out."

17:48.692 --> 17:48.984
{\an1}"Okay, cool."

17:49.067 --> 17:50.778
{\an1}So the night comes, I'm fully

17:50.861 --> 17:51.779
{\an1}prepared.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.780
{\an1}You know, I got the milk and

17:52.863 --> 17:53.155
{\an1}cookies on deck.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.282
{\an1}I write music, so I wrote a song

17:55.365 --> 17:56.784
{\an1}for the event.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.201
{\an1}We go to the gazebo.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.536
{\an1}And I'm feeling like so poetic

17:59.620 --> 18:00.496
{\an1}at this point.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.164
{\an1}[clears throat]

18:02.247 --> 18:05.167

18:11.673 --> 18:12.299

18:12.382 --> 18:14.426
{\an1}"know that this night

18:14.510 --> 18:15.886
{\an1}"is going so perfect,

18:15.969 --> 18:16.929
{\an1}and I'm loving it."

18:17.012 --> 18:17.554
{\an1}So I'm like, "Oh, snap, she hit

18:17.638 --> 18:19.056
{\an1}me with the--with the McDonald's

18:19.139 --> 18:20.849

18:20.933 --> 18:21.975
{\an1}You know, she really on me, you

18:22.059 --> 18:22.643
{\an1}know?

18:22.726 --> 18:23.435
{\an1}But she says, "I have to go

18:23.769 --> 18:24.686
{\an1}"Okay, cool."

18:24.770 --> 18:25.729
{\an1}So she goes to the restroom.

18:25.813 --> 18:26.438
{\an1}So, you know, I'm unbuttoning

18:26.522 --> 18:27.314
{\an1}the shirt.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.148
{\an1}I'm thinking, "Okay, she not

18:28.232 --> 18:29.858
{\an1}ready for this next verse."

18:29.942 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}'Cause this next verse I'm about

18:30.943 --> 18:32.277
{\an1}to go Prince on her.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.362
{\an1}And so she--she just doesn't

18:33.445 --> 18:33.612
{\an1}come back.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.405
{\an1}I'm like, "Damn," like you know

18:35.489 --> 18:36.198
{\an1}I'm doing the little vocal

18:36.281 --> 18:37.741
{\an1}exercises.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.785
{\an1}♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪

18:39.868 --> 18:41.370
{\an1}And so then I hear something in

18:41.453 --> 18:42.955
{\an1}the bushes.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.914
{\an1}And I think that's her playing.

18:43.997 --> 18:44.540
{\an1}So I'm like,

18:44.623 --> 18:45.457
{\an1}"Girl, stop playing.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.500
{\an1}I know that's you."

18:46.583 --> 18:47.125
{\an1}And then I hear it again.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.126
{\an1}And at that point when I heard

18:48.210 --> 18:51.004
{\an1}it again, like it really spooked

18:51.088 --> 18:51.630
{\an1}me.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.798
{\an1}"Girl, stop playing."

18:52.881 --> 18:54.007
{\an1}You know my voice is escalating,

18:54.091 --> 18:55.175
{\an1}you know?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.218
{\an1}I'm like, "Girl, stop playing.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.052
{\an1}You know, I--I know that's you."

18:57.135 --> 19:00.514
{\an1}On the third time, it was loud.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.473
{\an1}That's when my temper started

19:01.557 --> 19:02.766
{\an1}escalating, 'cause I'm like,

19:02.850 --> 19:04.393
{\an1}"Girl, stop playing!"

19:04.476 --> 19:06.395
{\an1}When I turned around, "What the

19:06.478 --> 19:07.271
{\an1}heezy?"

19:07.354 --> 19:10.190
{\an1}My heart stopped, because I'm

19:10.274 --> 19:11.191
{\an1}looking a bear straight in the

19:11.275 --> 19:12.401
{\an1}eye.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.569
{\an1}We just had like a moment.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.278
{\an1}You know, we just staring at

19:14.361 --> 19:15.028
{\an1}each other.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.196
{\an1}And then, uh, the bear got up

19:16.280 --> 19:16.989
{\an1}his hands.

19:17.072 --> 19:17.865
{\an1}Oh my God, he's throwing up gang

19:17.948 --> 19:18.782
{\an1}signs.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.992
{\an1}You know, now other bears is

19:20.075 --> 19:21.243
{\an1}gonna come out.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.828
{\an1}I'm not a bear-ologist, but I

19:22.911 --> 19:24.371
{\an1}think that's the signal to get

19:24.454 --> 19:25.664
{\an1}out, to escape.

19:25.747 --> 19:26.915
{\an1}I do a juke move.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.249
{\an1}The juke move.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.166
{\an1}I did it so many times, like I

19:28.250 --> 19:30.460
{\an1}done juke out my dog with this

19:30.544 --> 19:31.628
{\an1}move.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.170
{\an1}I done juked out 500-pound

19:32.254 --> 19:34.006
{\an1}lineman.

19:34.089 --> 19:34.590
{\an1}And when I faked him, the juke

19:34.673 --> 19:36.717
{\an1}move so good, that I juked

19:36.800 --> 19:40.220
{\an1}myself out.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.179
{\an1}And then that's what happened.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.180
{\an1}Oh, snap.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.766
{\an1}But when adrenaline going,

19:44.850 --> 19:45.934
{\an1}everything isn't there.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.436
{\an1}And so I caught up.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.312
{\an1}Let me tell you something.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.439
{\an1}The way I ran, I took myself

19:50.522 --> 19:51.648
{\an1}outside of my body and was

19:51.732 --> 19:52.941
{\an1}watching myself run.

19:53.025 --> 19:53.942
{\an1}The whole time I'm running, I'm

19:54.026 --> 19:54.818
{\an1}thinking, "Oh my gosh, he's on

19:54.902 --> 19:55.193
{\an1}me right now."

19:55.277 --> 19:57.529
{\an1}But the crazy thing is this.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.365
{\an1}When I got into the lodge,

20:00.449 --> 20:01.783
{\an1}people are looking at me like

20:01.867 --> 20:03.619
{\an1}I'm one of the Avengers.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.870
{\an1}"Oh my gosh, there he is."

20:04.953 --> 20:06.330
{\an1}And so the girl, she comes up to

20:06.413 --> 20:06.496
{\an1}me.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.916
{\an1}"Oh my gosh, how are you?"

20:08.999 --> 20:09.833
{\an1}"I'm cool, but I don't know how

20:09.917 --> 20:11.460
{\an1}"the bear is.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.836
{\an1}You know, you gotta ask him."

20:12.920 --> 20:14.379
{\an1}"I just wanna let you know what

20:14.463 --> 20:15.923
{\an1}"you did out there was so

20:16.006 --> 20:17.799
{\an1}"heroic, it was Medal of Honor

20:17.883 --> 20:18.884
{\an1}type stuff."

20:18.967 --> 20:19.968
{\an1}And she kisses me.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.386
{\an1}Like I felt like I was like

20:21.470 --> 20:22.346
{\an1}invincible.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.722
{\an1}And, uh, if the bear wanna run

20:23.805 --> 20:25.557
{\an1}up on me again then, you know,

20:25.641 --> 20:26.350
{\an1}at this point, I feel like we're
