00:19.478 --> 00:20.979
- You can't stay.
- What?

00:20.979 --> 00:23.732
- I'm sorry. I don't want my son--
- No problem, I'll leave.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.950
Hello.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.953
<i>Mark Bolton is dead.
He hung himself in the bathroom.</i>

00:35.953 --> 00:37.246
What?

00:37.246 --> 00:40.123
- <i>It just happened.</i>
- How is that possible?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.459
- <i>Can you come over?</i>
- Everything okay?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.837
- I'm on my way.
- <i>Sorry about this.</i>

00:44.837 --> 00:46.839
- <i>Thanks. I'll see you soon.</i>
- See you soon.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.757
Did something happen?

00:48.757 --> 00:52.302
Yes. Mark Bolton, a British official,
just committed suicide in our office.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.722
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know him?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.809
No. Well, yes. I'm the one who--

00:58.809 --> 01:00.894
- I'm the one who's in charge of his file.
- I'm truly sorry.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.479
- You all right?
- Jean-Marc, I have to go.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.065
- Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
- I'm really sorry.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.192
I'll let you leave first.
I'll be ready in five minutes.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.735
Okay, I'll wait for you.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.529
Oh, this cannot be happening.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.950
- I-- I'll be quick.
- Okay.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.787
Let me know if there's anything I can do
for you, okay?

01:19.496 --> 01:20.998
Okay.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.125
I'm not really busy right now.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.672
If it's serious and you need,
I don't know,

01:28.672 --> 01:30.549
that I go grocery shopping for you,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.760
don't hesitate to call me, Sabine.
There's no problem.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.729
You going to be okay?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.523
Turn up the volume.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.026
<i>Yes, yes, thanks.</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:54.990
Please.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.450
Sorry about that.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.535
- You can leave.
- Hey.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.503
- Call me if you need me, okay?
- Okay.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.214
Good luck. Good luck.

04:06.830 --> 04:11.084
Miss Rowdy, please show me where you
were standing when you saw the two men.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.630
I was right here. In front of the sink.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.466
I told you that I wasn't feeling well
and I was hunched over.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.432
I see. And...

04:26.308 --> 04:28.560
Are you sure you would be able to
identify them

04:28.560 --> 04:30.437
if your back was turned?

04:34.316 --> 04:35.526
Listen...

04:38.278 --> 04:40.489
I don't think Mark killed himself.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.159
I think this is murder.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.455
A murder? At the Commission?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.836
I see two unidentified men at the scene,
and yet you don't consider it a crime?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.879
They wanted to scare me.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.841
Sir, Miss Rowdy is very tired.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.594
She'll answer your questions later.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.476
Yes, Mr. Vandermeer.
Okay, let's take a look.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.854
Don't you see it's a conspiracy?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.648
Come, Miss Rowdy.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.625
- Didier?
- <i>Yes?</i>

05:34.126 --> 05:35.294
Bolton is dead.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.754
Calm down. It's not your fault.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.344
I heard he was receiving payoffs
from private companies. Did you know?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.932
Alison said she saw two men.
She says he was murdered.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.059
<i>Oh, yeah? Did she say that to the cops?</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:52.227
Of course!

05:56.440 --> 06:00.110
Listen, don't worry about that woman.
You have absolutely nothing to do with it.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.030
Now, if I told you
that Bolton was taking bribes,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.699
you would have to report him
to the Anti-Fraud Office.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.284
You can't overlook that.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.914
But if the Anti-Fraud Office investigates,

06:12.497 --> 06:14.291
<i>we won't be able to sign with them.</i>

06:16.502 --> 06:18.962
Oh, well, yes.
Rather sad for the poor Brits.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.632
<i>But it's good news for Antropa.</i>

06:47.658 --> 06:48.867
Miss Rowdy!

06:50.160 --> 06:51.411
You forgot this.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.501
- It's not mine.
- You're right.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.211
They killed Bolton.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.303
Why are you telling me this?

07:09.763 --> 07:10.973
Because I'm being used.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.854
They killed him so the Anti-Fraud Office
would investigate him.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.107
It'll take years.
You'll never be able to sign with the EU.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.234
Only with them.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.947
With whom? Who are these people?

07:28.365 --> 07:31.201
No, leave. You have to leave Brussels.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.703
Don't try to find out.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.582
The crash. It was them, right?

07:39.001 --> 07:41.628
Do you have proof? Documents?

07:44.339 --> 07:46.550
They monitor
all electronic communications.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.136
If I help you, I'm dead.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.891
Sabine...

07:57.436 --> 07:58.645
Thank you.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
I'm sorry. I misjudged you.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.657
Gabriel. Don't trust him.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.492
Who?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.954
I saw you with him this evening.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.878
He works for Antropa?

08:26.924 --> 08:28.342
Antropa?

08:31.762 --> 08:33.639
Oh, I-- I meant--

08:34.181 --> 08:36.390
Be careful, that's all.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.957
Samir. Get up, get up.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.755
- Here's your phone.
- And the credit card?

09:06.755 --> 09:08.090
It's in my pocket.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.300
Follow me.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.931
- Should I take it out?
- Give me the card.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.326
I'll watch. Okay?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.620
I'll watch. Go ahead.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.414
Be quick.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.166
Go ahead.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.128
INSERT YOUR BANK CARD.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.549
Is it working?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.092
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

09:55.053 --> 09:56.054
What?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.434
Did you withdraw the money?

10:02.019 --> 10:04.146
What a con!

10:05.272 --> 10:07.107
- Then, see you later.
- See you later.

10:29.588 --> 10:30.672
Samir.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.716
How are you, honey?

10:32.716 --> 10:35.802
Gabriel, the man who came to pick us up--

10:35.802 --> 10:37.846
He's with the French government.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.599
<i>He wants to help us.</i>

10:40.599 --> 10:42.309
Why? What did he say to you?

10:44.394 --> 10:48.148
You stole--
You stole information from people

10:48.732 --> 10:52.528
<i>and they are looking for us. To kill us.</i>

10:52.528 --> 10:55.906
If they find us,
they'll kill all three of us.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.783
Okay.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.288
This man, can we trust him?

11:03.872 --> 11:06.291
He's not alone. There's a woman with him.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.377
<i>She works for the English government.</i>

11:09.378 --> 11:11.213
They're taking good care of us.

11:13.632 --> 11:17.469
<i>Samir, we won't get out of this
on our own.</i>

11:17.469 --> 11:21.974
It may be a mistake,
but tell me where you are.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.522
I'm very close to you now.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.692
<i>I'm in Dunkirk.</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:34.820
Dunkirk.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.019
Here.
You can give this back to your girlfriend.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.897
What the hell are you doing with her?

12:11.315 --> 12:13.650
I planted a bug in her laptop. So what?

12:16.612 --> 12:19.281
You know that she's the one
that prevented us from signing?

12:20.449 --> 12:22.951
She's being controlled by someone
outside the Commission.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.918
What's wrong?

12:39.343 --> 12:42.179
My colleague, Bolton.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.015
I was there when they killed him.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.062
You saw them? Really saw them?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.320
You need to go back to London, Alison.
Right now.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.450
I know they're preparing an attack
and that Samir is the key to all this,

13:03.450 --> 13:04.826
and I'm supposed to run away?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.120
Who do you take me for?
One of your bitches?

13:07.663 --> 13:10.624
What are you talking about?
Are you talking about Sabine?

13:11.208 --> 13:14.419
Did you hear what I said?
If you stay here, you'll die.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.428
Anyway, I'm leaving too.
Samir called, he's in Dunkirk.

13:23.428 --> 13:27.474
Get ready, Myriam.
We're leaving in the morning.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.809
Okay, fine.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.894
I'm coming with you.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.689
- No, I don't think so.
- But if I stay here, I'll be killed.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.816
So I'd rather be with you.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.190
I want to know everything
about that bitch Alison Rowdy.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.859
If we don't stop her,
we'll be in deep shit.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.236
Alison Rowdy. Yes, I checked her profile.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.071
I expected her to cause some problems.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.376
Here.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.133
I even have a copy of her phone
if you're interested.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.479
Can I ask you a question?

14:55.479 --> 14:56.772
Yes.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.192
Why have you never told me about Antropa?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.029
I don't see why I would have told you.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.907
Well, because Antropa has
a reputation in my sector.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.868
They sell hypersonic missiles,
spy satellites, and cybersecurity.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.703
Of course, I'm interested.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
And?

15:14.373 --> 15:16.250
I want to know
what I'm getting myself into.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.709
Or I'm calling off the mission.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.254
It's classified information.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.798
Did they promise you something?

15:27.386 --> 15:28.595
I'll tell you.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.932
The president believes that Antropa
could become

15:31.932 --> 15:34.643
the first global exporter
in the military-industrial sector.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.812
My mission is to use any means necessary

15:36.812 --> 15:39.857
to make sure
the company signs with Great Britain.

15:39.857 --> 15:42.609
Which is totally illegal
according to European regulations.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.863
Well, there you go.

15:47.489 --> 15:51.076
No one can find out that France is pushing
for one of its private companies.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.580
Very well.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.708
Thank you for your explanation.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.545
A gift.

16:03.839 --> 16:06.216
With this, Alison Rowdy will be
your new best friend.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.683
I don't work for Antropa,
contrary to what you're insinuating.

16:14.683 --> 16:18.770
I work for France, which is doing
something it shouldn't be.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.420
<i>Jetliner 731, do you read?</i>

16:44.004 --> 16:47.382
Jetline 731, this is London Control.
Do you read?

16:49.760 --> 16:54.264
Jetline 731, if you read
this transmission, squawk 7600.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.438
And they've lost all comms?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.815
<i>Yes. Nothing on the radio or transponder.</i>

17:05.025 --> 17:07.528
- When did this happen?
- <i>Ten minutes ago.</i>

17:07.528 --> 17:09.238
How many passengers?

17:09.238 --> 17:11.740
<i>250, give or take.</i>

17:13.242 --> 17:14.617
Jesus Christ.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.871
<i>We don't have much time.
It's already three miles off course</i>

17:17.871 --> 17:19.540
<i>and losing height over the city.</i>

17:19.540 --> 17:20.832
Where exactly?

17:20.832 --> 17:24.336
<i>On current trajectory,
traffic control has it coming down in EC4.</i>

17:24.336 --> 17:26.797
<i>More or less on top of Saint Paul's.</i>

17:26.797 --> 17:28.882
That's a code 37.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.652
- Mayday. Mayday.
- <i>Pull up.</i>

17:50.779 --> 17:53.073
Jetline 731. Do you read?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.158
<i>Air traffic control,
we've lost control of aircraft.</i>

17:55.158 --> 17:57.244
- <i>Mayday. Can you read me?</i>
- <i>Jetline 731, do you read?</i>

17:57.244 --> 17:58.662
- <i>Pull up.</i>
- <i>Mayday.</i>

17:58.662 --> 18:00.998
<i>Air traffic control, we're about to crash.
Can you read me?</i>

18:00.998 --> 18:02.958
- <i>Pull up.</i>
- <i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

18:02.958 --> 18:05.002
- <i>Can you read me?</i>
- That's enough.

18:05.002 --> 18:07.713
- <i>Jetline 7--</i>
- <i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

18:07.713 --> 18:09.256
<i>Increase height.</i>

18:10.549 --> 18:13.343
<i>London Control, we are reading you.</i>

18:13.343 --> 18:15.345
<i>Climbing back up to 2,000 feet.</i>

18:15.345 --> 18:17.556
<i>No idea what the fuck just happened.</i>

18:19.016 --> 18:21.310
<i>The plane pretty much just went nuts.</i>

18:31.737 --> 18:34.573
<i>I've instructed
the Air Accident Investigation Branch</i>

18:34.573 --> 18:38.619
<i>to begin immediately an inquiry
into these events.</i>

18:38.619 --> 18:41.079
<i>And we've respectfully asked the media
to refrain from...</i>

18:41.079 --> 18:42.831
You getting this, Alison?

18:42.831 --> 18:46.210
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>...until we have the AAIB's report.</i>

18:47.294 --> 18:50.088
<i>Minister. Can you confirm, Minister,</i>

18:50.088 --> 18:53.217
<i>whether there's any suspicion of a link
between today's incident</i>

18:53.217 --> 18:55.594
<i>and the recent cyberattacks
on the Thames Barrier,</i>

18:55.594 --> 18:57.513
<i>Network Rail and the National Grid?</i>

18:57.513 --> 19:00.807
<i>And that is exactly the kind of question
that I've just spoken about.</i>

19:00.807 --> 19:02.893
<i>No, there is no evidence of any...</i>

19:02.893 --> 19:06.104
- People are scared.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

19:06.104 --> 19:09.107
And beginning to understand
just how powerless we are.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.193
What's the PM saying?

19:11.193 --> 19:14.238
Bugger all. PM.

19:14.238 --> 19:15.739
Covering his arse.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.369
Toby. Nice of you to join us.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.413
<i>Richard, what the fuck?</i>

19:23.997 --> 19:27.042
<i>I don't know what you think
you're playing at, but enough is enough.</i>

19:27.042 --> 19:29.628
<i>People need to feel protected.</i>

19:29.628 --> 19:31.880
You should have more faith
in the public, Toby.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.550
<i>What world are you living in, Richard?</i>

19:43.350 --> 19:44.560
Room service.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.231
Darling.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.277
You're decent?

19:53.277 --> 19:54.570
Come.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.071
Excuse me, madam.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.960
My God.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.839
I wonder
why they didn't go through with it.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.092
Because they're not actual terrorists.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.889
Of course you know more.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.601
You okay?

20:28.312 --> 20:30.147
Thank you for being here for me.

20:34.318 --> 20:35.527
What's up with you?

20:40.699 --> 20:42.284
Hobbs is downstairs.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.161
You traveled together?

20:44.703 --> 20:48.582
Well, she was coming to deal with
the Belgians over Bolton's death, and...

20:50.751 --> 20:53.295
Well, she needed to speak to you
about something.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.758
What's going on here, Albert?

21:14.525 --> 21:16.652
I'll be out of the room in ten minutes.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.498
So what is it?

21:30.749 --> 21:33.377
Darling, you need to speak to her.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.631
Glad you came.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.185
Gleason is ordering me

22:31.185 --> 22:36.565
to sign a cybersecurity contract
with a private company.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.734
They're talking to a firm called Antropa.

22:39.276 --> 22:40.819
<i>Antropa?</i>

22:41.403 --> 22:43.822
Well, I spoke to someone this morning
who implied a link

22:43.822 --> 22:45.365
between them and the attacks.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.533
<i>Who?</i>

22:46.533 --> 22:48.410
I can't say, but it's worth looking into.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.997
<i>Okay, I'll try and buy you some time.
We don't have much left.</i>

22:53.040 --> 22:56.001
Our only hope is the Syrian,
so I'm counting on you.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.463
Okay. Great.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.549
- So you wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.762
The two men you saw
when Bolton was killed, was one Delage?

23:07.763 --> 23:10.140
No, I would have recognized Delage.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.397
And have you had any contact with him
since you've been here?

23:17.397 --> 23:20.192
Why on earth would I have had
any contact with him?

23:24.613 --> 23:26.740
CCTV from the hospital
on the day of the crash

23:26.740 --> 23:29.326
shows you in Walid Hamza's room
with Delage.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.619
What?

23:36.333 --> 23:38.919
Hang on? I...

23:39.962 --> 23:44.383
I was on a call with Richard and, yes,
there was a man in the room, a nurse.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.052
- Doing what?
- Changing Hamza's IV bag.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.136
That was Delage?

23:48.136 --> 23:50.639
Do you know the odds of you
running into him by accident?

23:50.639 --> 23:52.140
- So what are you saying?
- Alison.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.018
Hold on. What is it
you're accusing me of, Detective?

23:59.648 --> 24:02.150
NEW MESSAGE - GABRIEL: YOU
COMING? NOON. PLACE DU CONGRÈS

24:02.150 --> 24:04.736
You know what? I need to go to the morgue.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.030
I have to get Bolton's autopsy results.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.749
I can't stop it. It won't stop!

24:17.749 --> 24:19.501
And look, here's a truck.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.260
It's a sheriff's badge!

24:28.260 --> 24:30.804
- Pierre?
- Mommy's here.

24:31.305 --> 24:33.432
- Go show your truck to mommy.
- Can I see your truck?

24:38.979 --> 24:40.189
It's really pretty.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.194
It's beautiful!

24:48.864 --> 24:50.490
You could've given me a heads up.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.784
Yes, but they gave me
a last-minute appointment in Brussels.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.745
It gave me an opportunity to see him.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.080
Isn't that right?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.373
Helena.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.084
Come on. Let's play some more.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.462
Let's sit down and play quietly.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.638
You're upset, aren't you?

25:18.143 --> 25:20.604
You know what you're going to do?
Go see a doctor,

25:20.604 --> 25:22.189
and tell them that you're traumatized.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.901
Then ask them to transfer you
to another department.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.530
You want me to change departments?

25:30.113 --> 25:33.367
You need to progress your career.
Especially after what you've gone through.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.787
What's your security clearance?
Level one, right?

25:36.787 --> 25:37.955
Yes, the maximum.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.374
If you have access to top secret
Commission documents,

25:40.374 --> 25:42.084
don't settle for less.

25:42.084 --> 25:45.212
Honey, high-level EU security clearance
is worth a lot of money.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.257
You're completely insane!
That's enough, Didier. Enough.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.135
You're using me. You're using your son.
You're disgusting.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.764
- I'm not forcing you. I just want--
- You are forcing me!

25:57.182 --> 25:59.518
You're important to me.
You're the father of my child.

26:00.269 --> 26:03.063
But find someone else
to do your dirty work. I'm done.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.317
Well, get some rest.
We'll talk about it again tonight.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.043
You good?

27:06.877 --> 27:08.128
Yes.

27:09.171 --> 27:10.464
Thanks be to God.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.092
Hello.

27:14.092 --> 27:16.553
<i>The people tracking Samir
will never give up.</i>

27:16.553 --> 27:19.473
<i>We have to fake his death,
or this'll never end.</i>

27:21.225 --> 27:23.268
<i>You have to figure out something credible.</i>

27:23.936 --> 27:25.354
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

27:26.188 --> 27:27.314
Okay. All right.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.858
Right here on your left.
Right here, please.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.193
Okay.

27:38.408 --> 27:39.993
- Thank you, keep the change.
- Thank you.

27:44.706 --> 27:48.126
<i>Tell me, you're not in contact
with Alison anymore, right?</i>

27:48.627 --> 27:49.795
No.

27:49.795 --> 27:53.674
<i>If she tries to get in contact
with you, don't answer, okay?</i>

27:53.674 --> 27:56.301
<i>Don't go near her, you understand?</i>

27:56.301 --> 27:57.594
Understood.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.562
- What's that?
- Scrambler.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.941
How are we going to contact Samir?

28:10.941 --> 28:13.694
Well, we'll disconnect it
when we call him.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.788
<i>Welcome to Antropa.</i>

29:07.497 --> 29:09.458
<i>Welcome to Antropa.</i>

29:14.922 --> 29:16.757
What is this shit, Bob?

29:18.425 --> 29:20.135
It's almost over.

29:20.135 --> 29:22.721
The Brits are so afraid
that they decided to sign with us.

29:22.721 --> 29:25.307
The issue is that Alison Rowdy
saw your killers.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.602
- So she got the picture.
- She has no power.

29:29.311 --> 29:31.813
She has lots of influence.
I guarantee she could ruin everything.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.649
We'll silence her.

29:34.483 --> 29:36.693
Like Bolton? Bravo, that's a great idea.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.029
Do you know who her father is?

29:41.573 --> 29:43.825
General Jack Rowdy,
formerly with the British Special Forces.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.869
Ten years as the head of NATO in Paris.

29:46.370 --> 29:49.998
He left the army during the Iraq War
to settle in France. He writes books.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.210
He's a mentor and friend of Richard Banks.

29:53.710 --> 29:57.798
People say that without Rowdy's influence,
Banks would have never become minister.

29:58.465 --> 30:02.177
So you can imagine what they would do
if anything were to happen to Alison.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.347
Do you have any other ideas then?

30:08.141 --> 30:09.351
This.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.669
All good?

30:51.602 --> 30:53.812
What are we going to do
once we find Samir?

30:58.609 --> 31:00.444
I want him to open that fucking USB key

31:00.444 --> 31:03.155
so I can give it to Banks
and avoid a disaster.

31:07.201 --> 31:10.162
And prove that I wasn't with you
to betray my country.

31:12.998 --> 31:14.291
Okay.

31:16.293 --> 31:19.463
And you? Are you with me or against me?

31:21.757 --> 31:23.258
Against you.

31:25.302 --> 31:26.720
All up against you.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.728
You like pissing me off, don't you?

31:34.728 --> 31:36.605
Me? Oh, not at all.

32:32.286 --> 32:34.496
DUNKIRK STATION

32:54.349 --> 32:56.143
Look, over there.

32:56.143 --> 32:58.687
That must be Samir's friend.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.280
- Yeah.
- Richard,

33:08.280 --> 33:09.573
<i>I think I found Samir.</i>

33:10.157 --> 33:11.366
Got him with you?

33:11.950 --> 33:13.911
<i>I will in about two minutes.</i>

33:20.876 --> 33:22.085
Krimo.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.881
- Krimo. What happened?
- You can come out.

33:25.881 --> 33:27.424
You can come out. Don't worry.

33:27.424 --> 33:29.092
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay, okay.

33:29.927 --> 33:32.221
- Where are you?
- Dunkirk.

33:36.058 --> 33:37.935
Gonna make it to your father's?

33:37.935 --> 33:40.229
- Yes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

33:40.812 --> 33:42.856
Okay, then. You-- Go to your dad's.

33:42.856 --> 33:45.067
And I'll get a team there
right away, okay?

33:45.067 --> 33:46.360
Richard.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.238
Samir is on Antropa's kill list.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.325
And I'm pretty sure I am too.

33:56.703 --> 33:57.913
Just--

33:58.413 --> 34:02.334
Just go to your father's, all right?
I'll phone him and say you're on your way.

34:02.918 --> 34:04.127
Okay.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.312
Aha!

34:25.607 --> 34:27.568
Myriam! Myriam!

34:32.281 --> 34:33.699
Am I dreaming?

34:38.579 --> 34:39.996
Thank God you're okay.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.373
Myriam.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.500
Hurry up.

34:48.422 --> 34:51.049
Samir. How are you? Let's go.

34:53.510 --> 34:54.511
Come on.

34:55.179 --> 34:56.722
- Come, come.
- Where?

34:56.722 --> 34:58.182
Just come. Come, come.

34:58.182 --> 34:59.725
- Who is this guy?
- Come here!

34:59.725 --> 35:01.560
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I know him. Come.

35:05.189 --> 35:07.357
What the hell is he doing?
Come on, come on.

35:09.443 --> 35:11.320
- Who's that?
- Don't worry.

36:05.541 --> 36:07.584
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Dad.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.259
Still alive.

36:27.604 --> 36:30.148
And this must be Samir.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.276
Hi.

36:32.776 --> 36:33.777
Jack, huh?

36:35.028 --> 36:36.488
Beautiful house.

36:36.488 --> 36:37.781
You're very welcome.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.451
A little too exposed.

36:43.287 --> 36:44.788
<i>Samir won't be safe here.</i>

36:46.456 --> 36:48.083
How safe does he need?

36:52.796 --> 36:56.175
<i>So, how's Banks? Still a grouchy old git?</i>

36:56.967 --> 36:59.845
- Pretty much.
- He ever gives you a hard time?

36:59.845 --> 37:01.763
Nobody gives me a hard time, Dad.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.101
Here we go.

37:07.019 --> 37:08.228
This way.

37:30.709 --> 37:31.710
Thank you, darling.

37:47.768 --> 37:49.186
Everything you need.

37:49.978 --> 37:52.189
Bed, shower, lavatory.

37:52.814 --> 37:55.567
- Make yourself at home.
- No, no, sir. I can't stay here.

37:55.567 --> 37:58.111
You want to leave? Give us back the money.

37:59.404 --> 38:02.491
If you want to get out, you can.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.622
If you need anything, call me.

38:38.151 --> 38:40.779
So what's he got you involved in
this time?

38:40.779 --> 38:42.447
- Dad--
- Oh, come on, sweetheart.

38:43.031 --> 38:47.035
One minute he's an eco-warrior. The next,
he's some sort of government agent.

38:47.578 --> 38:48.912
Jack's not happy?

38:48.912 --> 38:51.915
20 years on, he's still
hanging around like a bad smell.

38:51.915 --> 38:53.375
Okay, can we not?

38:56.545 --> 38:58.172
Dad, call Richard.

38:58.172 --> 39:01.592
Tell him everything is fine. We've got
Samir and we're waiting for his team.

39:01.592 --> 39:02.885
All right?

41:43.962 --> 41:45.589
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

41:46.507 --> 41:47.716
<i>Alison.</i>

41:48.383 --> 41:50.302
<i>What number is this?
Where the hell are you?</i>

41:50.302 --> 41:52.387
I just wanted to let you know I'm okay.

41:53.096 --> 41:54.556
<i>Why did you run off?</i>

41:55.224 --> 41:57.476
<i>Hobbs is convinced you're a suspect.</i>

41:57.976 --> 42:00.395
- What do you think?
- <i>I--</i>

42:00.395 --> 42:02.606
<i>Listen, just tell me where you are.</i>

42:02.606 --> 42:04.107
- <i>Alison?</i>
- Yes.

42:05.734 --> 42:06.735
<i>Alison.</i>

42:12.824 --> 42:14.117
Good evening.

42:14.117 --> 42:16.411
You're a bit late, don't you think?

42:16.995 --> 42:19.623
For me? Are you sure?

43:22.019 --> 43:23.020
FRENCH REPUBLIC DGSE

43:23.020 --> 43:24.396
DIRECTORATE-GENERAL
FOR EXTERNAL SECURITY

43:24.396 --> 43:27.357
<i>Nuclear power, no thanks!</i>

43:39.161 --> 43:42.331
<i>Hurry up, they're coming. Here's your bag.</i>

43:56.803 --> 43:58.514
<i>Come on, guys!</i>

43:58.514 --> 44:00.516
<i>Nuclear power, no thanks!</i>

44:16.073 --> 44:17.908
<i>Let's fight and push forward!</i>

44:24.164 --> 44:26.667
<i>What are you going to do about it?</i>

44:33.048 --> 44:35.133
- <i>What's wrong with you?</i>
- <i>Don't touch me like that!</i>

45:19.803 --> 45:21.346
Hello?

45:23.640 --> 45:27.853
Yes, I understand.
Who are you, bastard, anyway?

45:28.896 --> 45:30.105
Listen.

45:32.191 --> 45:33.984
Any idea who I am?

45:33.984 --> 45:37.404
You think you can call me
in my own home and blackmail me?

45:37.404 --> 45:40.199
I'll tell you what will happen now.
I'm going to call...

45:49.499 --> 45:50.709
Dad, I was wond--

45:52.419 --> 45:53.670
What are you doing?

45:54.338 --> 45:55.547
I'm not senile.

45:56.131 --> 45:58.550
And I'm not relying on
that pathetic war dog.

45:59.801 --> 46:02.095
- He's on our side.
- He's on his own bloody side.

46:03.972 --> 46:06.141
I don't want you getting shot for nothing.

46:13.732 --> 46:15.234
That's not Samir in there.

46:17.611 --> 46:19.238
He's a migrant.

46:19.238 --> 46:21.156
We paid him to be a decoy.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.124
So where's the real Samir?

46:32.459 --> 46:35.712
On a boat near Dunkirk.
Gabriel knows some people there.

46:36.713 --> 46:38.382
And you trust this man?

46:40.509 --> 46:42.386
After what you did to him?

46:44.429 --> 46:48.433
I'm trying to make up for what I did.
Don't take that away from me.

46:59.152 --> 47:00.362
Thank you.

47:09.746 --> 47:11.373
That smells good!

47:14.209 --> 47:15.419
Here.

47:16.378 --> 47:17.796
Give this to Samir, please.

47:26.388 --> 47:29.099
So come on.
What's the real reason you're here?

47:29.099 --> 47:30.559
Revenge?

47:31.059 --> 47:32.269
Redemption?

47:33.312 --> 47:35.355
Show us who we sacrificed?

47:36.148 --> 47:37.649
So you admit that's what you did?

47:37.649 --> 47:39.943
Actually, it was Alison
who made the accusation.

47:40.777 --> 47:43.989
- It was your idea.
- Still, you defend her.

47:46.366 --> 47:47.784
You knew it was me.

47:48.452 --> 47:50.621
I was nowhere near Nathalie
when this happened.

47:50.621 --> 47:52.497
- And still you--
- What?

47:52.497 --> 47:55.584
I protected my daughter
like any father would.

47:56.543 --> 47:59.671
Her happiness is the only thing
that matters to me.

48:03.175 --> 48:05.010
Does she really look happy to you?

48:13.227 --> 48:16.188
Did you know she was pregnant
when I took her back to England?

48:19.483 --> 48:22.194
He loves it. Compliments to the chef.

48:23.237 --> 48:25.739
Dad, come and have something to eat.

48:25.739 --> 48:28.408
Tell me.
Your father just said you were pregnant

48:28.408 --> 48:30.494
the last time we saw each other.
Is that true?

48:37.376 --> 48:39.002
I thought he knew.

48:40.754 --> 48:42.256
Why would he?

48:42.256 --> 48:44.341
It's nobody's business but mine.

48:53.892 --> 48:55.310
Back in a minute.

49:08.991 --> 49:10.367
What is he doing?

49:11.994 --> 49:13.495
What did you tell him?

49:27.050 --> 49:28.260
Gabriel.

49:41.648 --> 49:44.359
I've told you, the Syrian's not here.

49:45.444 --> 49:47.821
Leave my daughter out of this.

49:48.655 --> 49:51.533
- Do you hear me?
- Those aren't Banks' men.

49:51.533 --> 49:54.661
Go check on Krimo to make sure he does
nothing stupid. Hurry up. Quickly!

49:56.038 --> 49:58.081
I'm warning you.

49:58.081 --> 50:04.171
I am a former deputy supreme commander
of NATO and I am armed!

50:13.096 --> 50:16.058
Come on. Come on. Look. Your father.

50:16.058 --> 50:18.352
- Look.
- <i>Fuck off, Delage.</i>

50:18.352 --> 50:20.437
- <i>I can handle this.</i>
- What just happened?

50:20.437 --> 50:21.855
- <i>General.</i>
- Oh, shit.

50:21.855 --> 50:23.190
Hey! Alison!

50:28.612 --> 50:31.740
General. General.
Don't go there. Come back.

50:31.740 --> 50:33.367
They know who I am.

50:33.367 --> 50:35.369
They don't give a fuck
about who you are. Come, I said.

50:35.369 --> 50:37.538
Delage, don't push me.

50:37.538 --> 50:39.581
Listen, I know those guys
more than you do.

50:39.581 --> 50:42.084
- They're going to slaughter us. Come!
- Dad!

50:42.668 --> 50:44.753
You got us into this mess, Delage.

50:44.753 --> 50:48.590
- Now you mind your own fucking business.
- Dad!

50:54.763 --> 50:56.765
No! No.

51:01.228 --> 51:03.272
No. No!

51:11.572 --> 51:13.323
- Go, go, go!
- Behind you.

51:13.991 --> 51:15.158
Come on, come on.

51:15.158 --> 51:17.703
- <i>Let go of me!</i>
- <i>Hurry up!</i>

51:17.703 --> 51:18.954
Quick!

51:19.872 --> 51:21.540
Come in!

51:25.002 --> 51:26.253
Come in!

51:27.129 --> 51:28.380
Close the fucking door!

51:36.513 --> 51:37.890
What's going on?
