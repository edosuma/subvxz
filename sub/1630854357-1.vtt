- I'm Jan Broberg,

00:08.299 --> 00:11.511
and this series is based
on my story.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.805
I know it may
seem unbelievable,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.726
but we lived in
a different world back then.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.895
I want to tell
my family story today

00:20.937 --> 00:22.397
because so many seem to think

00:22.439 --> 00:25.400
something like this
could never happen to them,

00:25.442 --> 00:29.654
especially at the hands
of someone they know and trust,

00:29.696 --> 00:31.823
but it did happen.

00:31.865 --> 00:36.703
It happened to my family.
It happened to me.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.205

- What's all this?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.443
- Oh.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.862
Well, because we didn't get
to have you over

05:20.904 --> 05:23.823
for a summer picnic,
we decided to move it indoors.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.369
It's a little bit off the wall,
but that's just how we are.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.037

So, grab a pillow, and I will

Come on in.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.586
The moment I knew
we'd found the perfect place

05:36.628 --> 05:39.464
was when I met you outside
church that day, Mary Ann.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.007
- Oh, goodness.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.927
The girls love growing up here,
and I have no complaints.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.804
- I bet when you were
a little kid,

05:45.845 --> 05:48.682
and you pictured
the perfect place,

05:48.723 --> 05:51.685
this is probably what
you wanted for yourself, huh?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.853
- Yes, I guess it is.

05:53.895 --> 05:58.066
- What good luck that you folks
moved in two blocks up.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.275
I mean, I tell Mary Ann,

05:59.317 --> 06:03.196
it is always a good time
to make new friends.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.365
- Everyone in Pocatello's
already your friend.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.866
There's no one left.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.410
- That's where you come in,
Berchtolds.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.663
- Oh, boy.
- And the schools are so good.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.165
Oh, and the little theater.
- Mm.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.334
We saw all the kids in "Oliver"
the week we got here.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.045
Thought we took a wrong turn
and wound up on Broadway.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.505
- That was me!

06:20.547 --> 06:23.133
I was Oliver.
- Was it?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.135
- That was Jani in "Oliver."
She stole the show.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.886
Of course I think that.
I'm her father.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.931

a beautiful voice.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.647
Hey, Jani, what do you--

06:37.689 --> 06:39.149
what do you say
you sing for us now?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.192
- Oh, like a talent show?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.902
That sounds fun.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.404
- Okay.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.282
But I need to rehearse.
- Sure.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.660
Well, um, you can use
Jasper and Joel's room,

06:50.702 --> 06:52.162

06:52.203 --> 06:55.707

and Jacob, Karen, Susan?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.625
You be my audience.

Off you go.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.017
[quietly] Okay.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.936
I'm gonna do it quiet now,
but loud for them.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.522
- Oh, we could never live
in a big city.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.775
Not with all the noise
and violence.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.485
Not with three girls.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.653
- I like to see
the stars at night.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.406
- Oh. Gail.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.409
Speaking of stars...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.870
tell them about
your daddy's thing that he saw.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.373
This is--

07:36.414 --> 07:38.416
- [chuckles]

07:38.458 --> 07:40.126
Okay.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.050
I was just a girl.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.760
My daddy was driving home
from the feed store

07:48.802 --> 07:51.221
in Brigham City one night.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.808
The moon went behind a cloud.

07:54.849 --> 07:59.104
And he sees these two lights
moving across the field.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.481
Not headlights.
They were going too fast.

08:01.523 --> 08:05.318
So he sped up.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.904
And then he says to himself,

08:07.946 --> 08:11.866
"Oh, my goodness.
They're chasing me."

08:13.243 --> 08:15.620
Then, his truck
starts to go cuckoo.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.414
The radio and the dials.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.875
And then it just conks out in
the middle of the road, dead.

08:20.917 --> 08:25.338
And those lights just set down
across the field,

08:25.380 --> 08:27.757
watching him.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.136
And then they take off.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.347
And they go up, up,
into the sky,

08:34.389 --> 08:36.474
until they're gone.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.684
The next morning,
my mother and I

08:37.726 --> 08:40.061
went down to
the sugar beet field,

08:40.103 --> 08:44.816
and we saw that burnt circle
with our own eyes.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.325
- Did the truck start up again?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.245
- No, it never worked right
from that day on.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.085
- You ever seen a thing
like that, Jan?

09:07.922 --> 09:11.676
Well, never say never.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.268
Say, I am in the mood
for a talent show.

confusing with the two Bobs.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.384

<i>What's going on?</i>

39:59.774 --> 40:04.821
- Well, Berchtold--[sighs]

40:04.863 --> 40:07.991
Well, Berchtold went
and took Jan horseback riding,

40:08.033 --> 40:11.494
and they were supposed
to be back some time ago.

40:11.536 --> 40:13.913
It seems they went to a ranch

40:13.955 --> 40:16.207
that belongs
to a customer of yours?

40:16.249 --> 40:19.252
Does that ring a bell?
Do you know who that is?

40:19.294 --> 40:21.546
<i>- I can't say I know</i>
<i>a customer with a horse ranch.</i>

40:21.588 --> 40:23.173
<i>Not off hand.</i>

40:25.550 --> 40:27.594
- [sighs]

40:27.635 --> 40:31.598
Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for your help.

40:31.639 --> 40:34.476
<i>- Oh, don't worry, though.</i>
<i>You know how reliable he is.</i>

40:34.517 --> 40:37.771
<i>He's always saying how much</i>
<i>he thinks of you, Bob.</i>

40:37.812 --> 40:40.148
<i>He says, "Good old Broberg's</i>
<i>always there</i>

40:40.190 --> 40:41.566
<i>to give me a hand."</i>

40:46.154 --> 40:48.031
- You...

40:50.325 --> 40:51.659
Have a good night.

40:51.701 --> 40:58.833
<i>* *</i>

41:15.642 --> 41:17.644
- This one?

41:17.686 --> 41:19.896
- Yes. This is it right here.

41:39.541 --> 41:43.294
I guess I don't have the key.

42:00.645 --> 42:03.273
- What is it?

42:03.314 --> 42:05.233
Do you see it in there?

42:07.444 --> 42:09.195
- I can't see anything.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.574
We better get back home.

42:14.993 --> 42:17.328
- Just can't figure out why
he's got a motorhome in there

42:17.370 --> 42:18.663
without telling you.

42:53.448 --> 42:55.367
They didn't call?

42:57.077 --> 42:59.913
- Well, it must be car trouble.

42:59.954 --> 43:03.083
That's the only explanation.

43:03.124 --> 43:07.087
- I think we need to call
the police and let them know.

43:10.715 --> 43:12.133
- What'll you say?

43:12.175 --> 43:14.094
- Just that they were supposed
to be home by 6:30,

43:14.135 --> 43:16.304
and that we're getting a bit--
- Dad?

43:19.683 --> 43:20.975
- Yeah, Bright Eyes?

43:21.017 --> 43:24.479
- Did Jan and B come back yet?

43:24.521 --> 43:27.440
- Uh, no. No.

43:27.482 --> 43:28.817
Go on to bed now.

43:34.322 --> 43:39.160
- [sobbing]

43:41.246 --> 43:42.997
- What's wrong?

43:43.039 --> 43:45.000
- What's gotten into you, Gail?

43:49.879 --> 43:52.007
- I felt so bad.

43:53.383 --> 43:57.595
And we didn't
want to tell anyone.

43:57.637 --> 43:59.806
- Tell anyone what?

43:59.848 --> 44:02.183
- He's been struggling.

44:06.312 --> 44:09.482
There was this...

44:09.524 --> 44:13.862
little Mexican girl.

44:13.903 --> 44:17.532
You know how much
he loves children.

44:17.574 --> 44:21.202
And we've--we want another.

44:23.997 --> 44:27.334
Then, we heard about
this little girl down there.

44:27.375 --> 44:32.881
This Maria.

44:32.922 --> 44:34.841
Who needed a better life.

44:38.845 --> 44:42.849
So I flew down

44:42.891 --> 44:46.519
and met him with
all the adoption papers.

44:46.561 --> 44:48.605
[sighs]

44:48.646 --> 44:53.109
And she was cute as a button.

44:55.528 --> 44:59.074
But at the last minute...

44:59.115 --> 45:05.330
her mother just cried and cried

45:05.372 --> 45:06.956
and wouldn't let her go.

45:10.835 --> 45:13.046
[sighs]

45:14.255 --> 45:16.049
You should have seen
how disappointed he was

45:16.091 --> 45:18.760
that he had to
leave her in Mexico.

45:22.389 --> 45:25.642
- I had no idea.

45:25.684 --> 45:31.022
I guess that helps explain
his depression and so on.

45:38.279 --> 45:40.782
We still have
to call the police.

45:40.824 --> 45:43.785
- Oh, wait. Mary Ann.

45:43.827 --> 45:48.581
Wait until tomorrow.

45:48.623 --> 45:50.917
Whatever's got them delayed,

45:50.959 --> 45:53.545
he would never let anything
happen to her.

45:59.009 --> 46:02.220
And you know...

46:02.262 --> 46:04.806
he would never forgive you.

an inquiry for somebody there.

46:57.317 --> 46:58.902
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>What's your question?</i>

46:58.943 --> 47:02.155
- I was wondering
if anyone reported

47:02.197 --> 47:06.451
a car broken down
or an accident of some kind

47:06.493 --> 47:11.664
involving a green
1974 Ford Maverick.

47:11.706 --> 47:16.169
Anyone injured or...

47:16.211 --> 47:18.213
anything like that.

47:18.254 --> 47:19.964

47:58.128 --> 48:00.964
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

He'll take good care of her.

you'll give him a piece
