00:01.224 --> 00:02.556
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:02.592 --> 00:05.197
You are a cop in everything but name.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.040
Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.

00:07.076 --> 00:08.375
ALICE: <i>If a person comes into contact</i>

00:08.410 --> 00:10.235
<i>with my blood, it changes them.</i>

00:10.293 --> 00:12.236
<i>It affects every person differently.</i>

00:12.308 --> 00:14.341
OSWALD: <i>I won! They
really want me as mayor.</i>

00:14.364 --> 00:15.564
How did you know I would win?

00:15.599 --> 00:17.265
I believe in you, Oswald.

00:17.301 --> 00:18.734
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.001
Miss Kringle?

00:20.037 --> 00:21.436
No, my name's Isabella.

00:21.472 --> 00:22.771
NYGMA: <i>You remind me of someone.</i>

00:22.806 --> 00:23.805
I'm Edward.

00:23.841 --> 00:24.806
Nygma.

00:24.842 --> 00:26.408
GORDON: <i>The past is the past.</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:28.310
THOMPKINS: <i>I know that
we can't change the past,</i>

00:28.345 --> 00:30.770
<i>but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.</i>

00:30.816 --> 00:32.781
Who... do you love?

00:32.816 --> 00:34.449
Or I shoot both them,

00:34.485 --> 00:37.085
which would be such a thrill.

00:37.154 --> 00:38.696
Kill Lee.

00:39.123 --> 00:40.422
(gasps)

00:42.359 --> 00:44.426
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:47.454 --> 00:49.030
(whispering): I'm so
sorry this happened.

00:54.004 --> 00:56.471
Stop the press.

00:57.556 --> 00:59.941
Tough guy Jim Gordon

01:00.355 --> 01:02.677
sheds tear for Valerie Vale.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.874
How you feeling?

01:09.037 --> 01:11.386
Like a bullet went through my insides.

01:11.421 --> 01:13.221
You don't have any whiskey, do you?

01:13.257 --> 01:16.024
- Sorry.
- You get a girl shot

01:16.059 --> 01:18.266
and you don't even bring her booze.

01:19.234 --> 01:21.413
You got a lot of nerve.

01:22.758 --> 01:24.801
I never meant for you to get hurt.

01:25.999 --> 01:27.386
You did.

01:28.411 --> 01:30.622
You wanted to save Lee.

01:31.430 --> 01:32.824
I wanted to save you both.

01:32.881 --> 01:35.727
Yeah, but you could only save one of us.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.129
That's why you told Tetch

01:37.164 --> 01:41.366
to kill Lee because you knew
he would do the opposite.

01:43.078 --> 01:44.870
Oldest trick in the book.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.372
At least tell me you caught him.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.567
He's still in the wind. Listen.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.487
- Vale, it's not what you think.
- It is.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.034
You love Lee.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.923
Which means we're done.

- If there's anything I can do...
- No.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.202
No, Tetch was right.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.533
You're nothing but trouble.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.151
HERBALIST: <i>So...</i>

02:33.187 --> 02:34.653
let me get this straight.

02:35.262 --> 02:37.956
You're about to be in
possession of some kind of...

02:37.992 --> 02:39.591
virus?

02:39.626 --> 02:41.760
Yes.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.130
It's blood-based and can
be a little unpredictable.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.233
It can take weeks for
symptoms to manifest.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.334
(whistling quietly)

02:49.370 --> 02:50.302
Oh!

02:50.337 --> 02:53.372
- This...
- (jingles lightly)

02:53.407 --> 02:55.440
is an accelerant.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.641
Mix it with the blood...

02:56.677 --> 02:58.677
- wham... bam...
- (explosion noise)

02:58.712 --> 03:00.345
That virus'll hit 'em like a semi

03:00.381 --> 03:02.147
going 90. (chuckles)

03:05.352 --> 03:07.819
(Herbalist gasps, laughs)

03:07.855 --> 03:09.521
"The Red Queen."

03:09.556 --> 03:13.025
She's a blend of psychotropic plants.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.393
Ah, thought she'd be a big hit.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.494
Turns out, she's only good

03:15.529 --> 03:17.396
at putting people in the loony bin.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.131
- I'll take her!
- Ah-ah-ah, b-b...

03:19.166 --> 03:21.133
That stuff's... no joke.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.869
At first, it incapacitates you. Then...

03:23.904 --> 03:25.670
an hour into the
trip... (sizzling noise)

03:25.706 --> 03:27.205
it completely fries your brain.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.373
Perfect.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.375
I'm looking to sideline someone

03:30.411 --> 03:32.577
before this evening's event.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.946
(exhales) That'll do it.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.682
Hey, uh, what exactly are you...

03:37.718 --> 03:39.918
planning?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.454
(chokes)

03:46.555 --> 03:49.928
JERVIS: This city tore my love from me,

03:49.963 --> 03:53.865
so I'm plunging it into insanity.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.334

ISABELLA: And that's where I
discovered my love of books.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.480
(Nygma chuckles)

04:08.515 --> 04:09.781
I never thought a fractured tibia

04:09.817 --> 04:11.049
would launch my library career.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.951
But it did. Fun fact:

04:12.986 --> 04:15.587
The tibia is the second-largest
bone in the body.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.289
Second only to the femur.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.027
You have exquisite femurs.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.503
PAPERBOY: Morning!

04:31.538 --> 04:33.171
The morning paper.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.739
What time is it?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.641
Oh, uh... it's just past 6:00.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.848
(clears throat) Uh, Edward...

04:44.076 --> 04:47.586
These past 12 hours have
been the best of my life.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.361
When can we meet again?

04:51.941 --> 04:53.892
What can't you have
for breakfast or lunch?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.862
Dinner. I'd love to.

04:56.897 --> 04:57.963
Delightful.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.564
Meet me at the mayor's mansion at 8:00.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.153
OSWALD: <i>I understand
that one is expected</i>

05:21.188 --> 05:24.356
to wait 24 hours before filing
a missing persons report,

05:24.391 --> 05:26.324
but, sir, I am the mayor.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.174
- Oswald.
- (phone crashes)

05:28.243 --> 05:30.162
I am so sorry.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.530
(panting)

05:31.565 --> 05:32.731
When you didn't come home,

05:32.766 --> 05:35.066
I assumed the worst. (laughs)

05:35.102 --> 05:37.903
I am so glad you're okay.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.171
I'm better than okay.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.740
I met someone.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.844
I think I'm in love. (laughs)

05:55.556 --> 05:56.855
(electronic beep)

05:58.458 --> 06:01.026
MAN: Hey! Hey, you can't be down here.

06:02.729 --> 06:03.729
Oh, I disagree.

06:16.416 --> 06:19.010
I don't understand why
we're doing all this, boss.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.680
Wasn't plugging Gordon's
girlfriend enough?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.648
Jim Gordon wasn't the
only one responsible

06:23.684 --> 06:25.097
for my sister's death.

06:25.753 --> 06:29.020
Gotham ripped Alice from my loving arms

06:29.056 --> 06:30.889
and turned her against me.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.924
What better way

06:32.960 --> 06:34.526
to make this city pay

06:34.561 --> 06:38.797
than by spreading my dear,
dead sister's legacy?

06:46.393 --> 06:48.225
Oh, Alice...

07:10.700 --> 07:12.666
Well. It's quite the operation

07:12.702 --> 07:15.035
you've got going on in here,
isn't it, Master Bruce?

07:15.071 --> 07:17.037
Do you need a hand?

07:17.073 --> 07:18.672
I got it.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.507
Right.

07:20.543 --> 07:22.851
What time can we expect Ms. Kyle?

07:22.897 --> 07:24.678
6:00, I think.

07:24.714 --> 07:26.180
We'll see, won't we?

07:27.249 --> 07:28.749
She's coming, Alfred.

07:29.404 --> 07:31.752
And, uh, Alfred...

07:31.787 --> 07:33.620
Yes, yes. I know, uh...

07:33.656 --> 07:35.055
I'll make myself scarce,

07:35.091 --> 07:37.725
I'll give you all the
privacy that you need.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.059
Within earshot.

07:40.730 --> 07:42.796
And the lights on.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.605
Well, I got bad news and worse.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.373
Skip the preamble.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.508
It was definitely Tetch
and his two dum-dums.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.211
And? What about Alice's body?

08:00.246 --> 08:02.747
The eggheads here have had her
body on ice since it arrived.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.116
Her blood's frozen, but still viable.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.851
The second Tetch heats it up...

08:06.886 --> 08:09.520
He has himself the virus.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.369
How the hell did he even get in here?

08:11.426 --> 08:12.843
The old-fashioned way.

08:12.912 --> 08:14.859
Somebody let him in. I got
an unconscious lab tech

08:14.894 --> 08:16.260
and a missing guard.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.997
My money's on the guard.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.498
Shouldn't you be in
the hospital with Vale?

08:20.753 --> 08:22.220
She's fine. Give me the rundown.

08:22.255 --> 08:24.989
Oh, so I take it you're
rejoining the force?

08:25.024 --> 08:26.724
I just want to help.

08:26.759 --> 08:29.026
There's no reason I need
to be a cop to do that.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.429
Well, as long as I'm
captain of the GCPD you do.

08:31.464 --> 08:33.898
I'm tired of giving you slack.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.866
Get the hell off my crime scene

08:35.902 --> 08:38.034
before I throw you ass in lockup.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.837
Biehl, Alban,

08:40.874 --> 08:43.640
escort Mr. Gordon off of the premises.

08:43.676 --> 08:46.577
If he resists, book him for obstruction.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.913
I'll go on my own.

08:51.818 --> 08:52.884
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh-uh!

08:52.919 --> 08:54.285
No. I see that look in your eye.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.487
Do not try to solve this by yourself.

08:56.522 --> 08:58.256
Then help me. If Tetch
has Alice's blood,

08:58.291 --> 08:59.624
we don't have much time.

08:59.659 --> 09:01.893
No, I'm not gonna aid
you on one of your solo,

09:01.928 --> 09:03.728
bullcrap, kamikaze missions anymore!

09:03.763 --> 09:05.363
Tetch murdered four people yesterday.

09:05.398 --> 09:07.398
He shot Vale... I can't just
let him get away with it.

09:07.433 --> 09:09.600
Nobody's asking you to.
But Barnes is right.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.436
Either be a cop, or don't.

09:12.472 --> 09:14.071
What are you so afraid of?

09:14.107 --> 09:15.766
Is that what you think?

09:16.910 --> 09:18.509
That I'm afraid?

09:18.544 --> 09:20.845
You know, you should go to the hospital.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.179
Be with Vale.

09:22.215 --> 09:24.415
And let those of us who
want to wear the badge

09:24.450 --> 09:26.118
do our damn jobs.

09:31.424 --> 09:33.824
You are going to cut
quite the fine figure

09:33.860 --> 09:35.426
at the Founders' dinner tonight.

09:35.461 --> 09:38.429
Yes. Did you know that this dinner

09:38.464 --> 09:41.699
has been thrown annually
for over 200 years?

09:41.734 --> 09:44.101
It was started by the
first families of Gotham.

09:44.137 --> 09:47.148
Only the most powerful
citizens are invited.

09:48.864 --> 09:50.875
It's a shame I don't have a "plus one."

09:50.910 --> 09:52.807
I can't go anyway. I have a date.

09:53.980 --> 09:55.813
With the woman you
claim to be in love with

09:55.848 --> 09:57.581
after only knowing for a few hours?

09:57.617 --> 09:59.583
The heart keeps its own time.

10:02.322 --> 10:03.587
I'm partial to the purple.

10:04.451 --> 10:06.891
The brocade brings out my eyes.

10:09.262 --> 10:11.529
Are you sure you aren't
mistaking infatuation for love?

10:11.564 --> 10:13.497
You did say she is the
spitting image of Kringle.

10:15.168 --> 10:16.673
Isabella's beautiful.

10:16.995 --> 10:18.469
And smart.

10:19.227 --> 10:23.107
So she... bears a passing
resemblance to Kristin.

10:23.142 --> 10:24.909
It's just the universe telling me...

10:24.944 --> 10:27.358
Telling me I have a
second chance at love.

10:29.849 --> 10:31.148
Where did you say she works?

10:31.184 --> 10:33.551
The Main Public Library.

10:33.586 --> 10:34.952
You're right about the brocade.

10:34.988 --> 10:37.321
Do you mind if I skedaddle?

10:37.357 --> 10:39.523
I just need to pick up a
few things for tonight.

10:41.527 --> 10:43.594
Who am I to stand in the way of love?

10:51.838 --> 10:54.505
The missing guard from the
lab, he called in sick.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.138
My gut says he's lying.

10:56.195 --> 10:58.809
Well, he's certainly no
candidate for sainthood.

10:58.845 --> 11:00.077
Gambling, petty theft...

11:00.113 --> 11:02.246
- (knock on door)
- Might I have a word, Captain?

11:02.281 --> 11:03.948
Bring him in.

11:03.983 --> 11:05.349
What is it?

11:05.385 --> 11:06.884
I just heard from the head of virology

11:06.919 --> 11:08.285
at the Biomedical facility.

11:08.321 --> 11:10.521
Is this about the tests they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

11:10.556 --> 11:11.489
Yes, in the first trial...

11:11.524 --> 11:13.524
One of the rats ran off the rails
and murdered the rest, I know.

11:13.559 --> 11:15.326
Doc Thompkins told me.

11:15.361 --> 11:17.661
But she thought it might
have been an anomaly.

11:17.697 --> 11:19.630
I'm afraid the second
study proves otherwise.

11:19.665 --> 11:21.532
As in the first study, the rats showed

11:21.567 --> 11:23.634
increased strength and agility, but...

11:23.669 --> 11:26.070
by week two...

11:26.105 --> 11:27.671
the rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies.

11:27.707 --> 11:29.673
Violent rage.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.675
By the study's end, every trace of their

11:31.711 --> 11:33.177
original demeanor had vanished.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.747
I assume they're, uh, working on a cure.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.016
Yes, but it could take years.

11:39.052 --> 11:40.684
And we only have hours.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.053
Damn it!

11:42.088 --> 11:44.488
If this virus gets set free...

11:47.126 --> 11:49.060
We have to find Tetch, now.

11:49.095 --> 11:50.327
Yes, sir.

11:51.597 --> 11:53.564
(blood gurgling)

12:01.274 --> 12:03.774
JERVIS: Watch closely, Dumfree.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.110
Isn't science marvelous?

12:07.180 --> 12:09.880
Gravity, a few heaters...

12:09.916 --> 12:11.382
and voilÃ !

12:11.417 --> 12:14.852
The last drops of coagulated blood

12:14.887 --> 12:16.954
become cocktail mix.

12:23.696 --> 12:25.162
JERVIS: Ah!

12:25.198 --> 12:27.298
Bravo, Alice.

12:27.854 --> 12:31.969
Truly... your best work.

12:43.313 --> 12:44.413
- You're kidding me?
- Please, calm down.

12:44.448 --> 12:46.998
- He said, "Kill Lee"?
- He knew Tetch wouldn't.

12:47.021 --> 12:48.054
How?

12:48.089 --> 12:49.622
How could he possibly have known that?

12:49.657 --> 12:52.525
Somehow he got inside Tetch's head.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.487
And he knew that he would do the
opposite of what he told him to.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.494
I see. So, why would Gordon offer up

12:57.540 --> 12:59.974
the woman he's dating
in place of my fiancée?

13:00.009 --> 13:01.409
Mario, stop it.

13:01.444 --> 13:02.743
We have so much to be thankful for.

13:02.779 --> 13:04.545
I just want to move past this.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.381
Fine.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.849
But Jim Gordon's the reason

13:08.885 --> 13:10.251
you were in danger to begin with.

13:10.286 --> 13:12.119
I want him out of our lives.

13:12.155 --> 13:14.055
Of course.

13:20.396 --> 13:23.195
I came by to bring this to... Vale.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.267
(pager beeping)

13:26.302 --> 13:28.202
I got to get back to the ER.

13:41.651 --> 13:43.150
He's angry.

13:43.186 --> 13:45.456
I get that.

13:46.289 --> 13:48.122
He has every reason to be.

13:48.157 --> 13:50.825
I figured you'd be out
chasing down Tetch.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.488
Barnes banned me.

13:53.229 --> 13:55.229
No badge. No investigation.

13:55.264 --> 13:57.331
That's never stopped you before.

13:57.366 --> 13:59.433
They closed ranks.

13:59.469 --> 14:00.634
Even Bullock.

14:02.605 --> 14:05.343
He says I'm refusing the
badge because I'm afraid.

14:07.710 --> 14:11.011
Jim... I know what you did

14:11.047 --> 14:12.813
last night.

14:12.849 --> 14:16.042
When you told Tetch to kill me,
you knew he would shoot Vale.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.954
No, I'm sorry. That's not true.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.257
At least have the decency
to be honest with me.

14:23.292 --> 14:24.658
I am being honest.

14:24.694 --> 14:27.027
I wanted to save Vale.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.030
Bullock was right.

14:30.066 --> 14:31.799
You are afraid.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.017
(bell dings)

14:54.090 --> 14:55.153
Hello, there. (chuckles)

14:55.245 --> 14:57.024
Mr. Mayor, what an honor.

14:57.059 --> 14:58.359
How can I help you?

14:58.997 --> 15:01.328
I am attending the Founders'
dinner this evening

15:01.364 --> 15:04.064
and I wanted to brush up on the history

15:04.100 --> 15:05.332
of Gotham's first families.

15:05.368 --> 15:08.394
My chief of staff suggested I come here.

15:09.172 --> 15:11.172
I think you might know him.

15:11.207 --> 15:14.008
Yes. I know Edward.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.676
We just met,

15:15.745 --> 15:18.045
but...

15:18.080 --> 15:20.915
well, I feel I've known
him my whole life.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.349
(sighs)

15:22.385 --> 15:24.351
How romantic.

15:24.387 --> 15:26.654
Oh, listen to me, blathering on.

15:26.689 --> 15:28.088
You wanted a book.

15:28.124 --> 15:29.223
Um...

15:29.258 --> 15:30.624
Oh.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.626
I'm...

15:32.662 --> 15:34.528
so glad you appreciate Ed.

15:35.832 --> 15:37.198
(nervously chuckles)

15:38.734 --> 15:42.191
Really, I should thank you
for brightening Ed's spirits.

15:43.139 --> 15:47.808
He has been so down since
he got out of Arkham.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.982
Edward... was in Arkham?

15:55.927 --> 15:57.251
You don't know?

15:58.621 --> 16:00.788
It was front page news.

16:00.823 --> 16:02.656
I stick to books.

16:02.692 --> 16:06.594
Don't people typically
go to Arkham for murder?

16:07.663 --> 16:09.697
I make it a policy not to gossip

16:09.732 --> 16:11.303
about staff, but...

16:12.034 --> 16:13.567
(mouthing silently)

16:13.636 --> 16:16.303
(huffs)

16:22.144 --> 16:23.844
(gasps slightly)

16:23.880 --> 16:27.463
Uncanny how much you look like her.

16:28.351 --> 16:31.252
It's that swan-like neck.

16:31.287 --> 16:34.622
- (nervously chuckles)
- Ed loves a neck.

16:34.657 --> 16:35.823
(laughs)

16:35.858 --> 16:37.524
(nervously laughs)

16:37.560 --> 16:39.593
Well, thank you for the book.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.396
It was a pleasure meeting you.

16:48.971 --> 16:50.137
(exhales)

17:07.223 --> 17:08.789
Hey.

17:08.824 --> 17:10.523
Hey!

17:10.559 --> 17:11.659
Hey!

17:13.162 --> 17:16.230
JERVIS: The tea party was part one.

17:16.265 --> 17:18.464
I want to have a lot more fun.

17:25.273 --> 17:27.340
JERVIS: I had my way with you.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.245
Now Gotham's up for round two.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.607
The hell are you talking about?

17:33.642 --> 17:36.850
Why, I'm going to dismantle
your beloved city,

17:36.886 --> 17:40.397
from the top... on down.

17:45.475 --> 17:48.062
And you can't stop me.

17:49.632 --> 17:51.537
Enjoy the trip.

17:52.535 --> 17:54.925
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

18:00.614 --> 18:02.113
WOMAN: There you are.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.649
(indistinct conversations)

18:04.684 --> 18:05.850
MAN: So good to see you.

18:05.886 --> 18:06.985
MAN 2 (laughing): Likewise.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.453
MAN 1: Come on, let's get some wine.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.455
(indistinct conversation)

18:17.764 --> 18:19.864
Watch where you're going.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.435
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.370
So sorry.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.972
Cretin.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.554
(angelic voices singing)

18:54.000 --> 18:56.067
Jim.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.538
Jim.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.954
Jim!

19:04.845 --> 19:07.178
Finally, sleeping beauty stirs.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.881
Where am I?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.349
You got dosed, buttercup.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.151
Welcome to your hallucination.

19:16.195 --> 19:18.857
- What are you doing in it?
- Hell if I know.

19:18.892 --> 19:22.360
Now, we've got a lot
to be getting on with.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.461
I don't have time for this.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.763
(shouts)

19:25.799 --> 19:28.600
See, that's the thing about
hallucinations, Jimbo.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.668
You got to ride out the trip.

19:30.704 --> 19:32.539
Bummer, huh?

19:37.015 --> 19:39.449
What exactly does this trip entail?

19:39.484 --> 19:41.985
Well, no one gave me an itinerary,

19:42.020 --> 19:44.254
but knowing what goes
on inside your head,

19:44.289 --> 19:45.889
I'm sure it'll be
chock-full of belly laughs.

19:45.924 --> 19:47.490
(laughs)

19:47.526 --> 19:48.725
Just kidding.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.628
We all know fun isn't your forte.

19:51.663 --> 19:53.797
(elevator bell dings slowly)

19:53.832 --> 19:56.299
This is where I face
my inner demons, huh?

19:56.335 --> 19:58.535
That's up to you.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.674
Well, go on.

20:04.710 --> 20:07.644
Unless you want to stay in
this tiny space with me.

20:08.363 --> 20:10.246
I'll take my chances.

20:19.124 --> 20:21.391
(ghostly): Jim.

20:21.426 --> 20:22.859
Jim.

20:26.064 --> 20:27.897
Jim.

20:27.933 --> 20:31.134
Jim.

20:33.205 --> 20:34.437
Bruce?

20:34.473 --> 20:36.373
You don't have much time.

20:36.408 --> 20:38.174
What are you talking about?

20:38.210 --> 20:40.263
(fading): You don't have much time.

20:40.286 --> 20:41.711
(echoing): Bruce.

20:41.747 --> 20:43.116
Bruce!

20:49.654 --> 20:51.921
Where did Bruce go?

20:53.291 --> 20:54.958
(machine gun firing rapidly)

20:54.993 --> 20:56.393
(speaking backwards)

20:58.930 --> 21:00.897
(speaking backwards)

21:00.932 --> 21:01.765
What?

21:01.800 --> 21:03.366
(explosion booms)

21:03.402 --> 21:06.569
Never leave your unit behind.

21:06.605 --> 21:09.339
(humming)

21:09.374 --> 21:11.441
I have to find him.

21:11.476 --> 21:13.243
(humming "Goodnight, Sweetheart,
Goodnight" by The Spaniels)

21:17.916 --> 21:20.350
Bruce. Bruce!

21:24.523 --> 21:25.989
I'm glad you came.

21:26.024 --> 21:29.793
What did you mean when you
said I didn't have much time?

21:29.828 --> 21:32.095
I just wanted you to follow me...

21:32.130 --> 21:33.630
- (man screaming faintly)
- so I could show you that.

21:33.665 --> 21:36.232
(men groaning)

21:36.268 --> 21:37.233
Down there.

21:37.269 --> 21:39.469
(screaming)

21:39.504 --> 21:41.137
It's because of you.

21:41.206 --> 21:44.474
(screaming, moaning)

21:44.509 --> 21:46.042
BRUCE: Congratulations, Jim.

21:46.077 --> 21:47.277
You did it.

21:47.312 --> 21:49.546
You're the hero you
always dreamed of being.

21:50.816 --> 21:52.261
Bruce...

21:52.750 --> 21:53.750
Don't...

21:53.785 --> 21:55.552
(grunts)

22:18.643 --> 22:20.577
(screams)

22:20.645 --> 22:22.679
Your name was on the schedule.

22:22.714 --> 22:25.515
Yeah, I told you. It was my
shift at the bio lab, but I...

22:25.550 --> 22:27.450
- came down with something.
- The only thing you're coming down

22:27.486 --> 22:30.137
with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.521
BARNES: Hey, hey, hey.

22:31.556 --> 22:34.023
That's no way to treat a sick man.

22:34.059 --> 22:35.673
Listen, Sullivan,

22:35.811 --> 22:38.428
Tetch got in using an
employee's key card.

22:38.463 --> 22:40.129
Just show us your card,
and you're free to go.

22:40.165 --> 22:41.698
Screw you.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.233
I want a lawyer.

22:44.135 --> 22:45.301
(scoffs)

22:45.337 --> 22:47.370
- (chuckles)
- (heart beating)

22:47.405 --> 22:49.405
You pigs think you're such tough guys...

22:49.441 --> 22:51.107
(grunts)

22:51.142 --> 22:54.477
Honest citizens driven mad,

22:54.513 --> 22:56.579
tearing each other limb from limb

22:56.615 --> 22:59.649
just because you decided
that this city's security

22:59.684 --> 23:02.085
is not your concern!

23:02.120 --> 23:04.120
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

23:04.155 --> 23:05.955
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

23:05.991 --> 23:07.657
- Captain! Cap.
- Aah...

23:07.692 --> 23:08.791
Cap! Hey.

23:08.827 --> 23:11.494
I thought I was supposed
to be the bad cop here.

23:11.530 --> 23:13.296
A bruiser in a wrestling mask

23:13.331 --> 23:15.965
paid me to hand over my key
card and take the day off.

23:16.001 --> 23:18.134
Promised I wouldn't get in trouble.

23:18.169 --> 23:21.471
Said the cops would be too busy
taking back control of the city.

23:21.506 --> 23:23.206
And?

23:23.241 --> 23:24.974
Tell us something that
might actually help.

23:25.010 --> 23:28.177
He was driving a catering van.

23:28.213 --> 23:29.913
Why would the Tweeds
need a catering van?

23:29.948 --> 23:31.648
Wait.

23:31.683 --> 23:33.016
What's the date?

23:33.051 --> 23:34.551
Friday.

23:34.586 --> 23:36.819
The date.

23:36.855 --> 23:38.388
The 27th.

23:38.456 --> 23:40.423
The Founders' dinner.

23:40.458 --> 23:42.292
The archbishop, the
comptroller, the mayor,

23:42.360 --> 23:43.860
all in the same place.

23:43.895 --> 23:46.563
Put together a unit.

23:46.598 --> 23:49.198
And not a word to Gordon.

23:49.234 --> 23:51.234
(sirens wailing, horns honking)

23:55.340 --> 23:57.473
A drop of blood

23:57.509 --> 24:00.176
in each wine glass

24:00.211 --> 24:02.478
makes madmen...

24:02.514 --> 24:05.048
of the ruling class.

24:18.296 --> 24:21.130
(inhaling, exhaling)

24:21.166 --> 24:23.833
(coughs, grunts)

24:23.868 --> 24:25.969
What the hell are you doing?

24:26.004 --> 24:28.371
Saving your life. Like you wanted.

24:28.406 --> 24:31.407
The last thing I want is
your lips on my mouth.

24:31.443 --> 24:32.709
(scoffs) News flash.

24:32.744 --> 24:34.243
Everything that is happening

24:34.279 --> 24:35.445
is in your head.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.313
Which means you made me give you CPR.

24:37.349 --> 24:38.681
Just like you put me

24:38.717 --> 24:41.751
in this really cheesy nurse's uniform.

24:41.786 --> 24:43.686
That's easily rectified.

24:44.756 --> 24:47.056
(scoffs) Seriously?

24:47.092 --> 24:49.359
One bad encounter with Bruce, and...

24:49.394 --> 24:50.760
I don't want to talk about it.

24:50.795 --> 24:53.096
Fine. Just don't fall into
a monosyllabic depression

24:53.131 --> 24:55.431
because... (elevator stops)

24:55.467 --> 24:57.000
We're at the next stop.

24:57.035 --> 25:00.136
I have mixed feelings about this floor.

25:01.640 --> 25:04.107

Ha! Mom owes me a quarter.

25:23.395 --> 25:25.061
Mom!

25:25.096 --> 25:27.964
(chuckles) We made a bet
that you were gonna be late.

25:27.999 --> 25:30.335

25:46.051 --> 25:48.418
Sorry. You just look so beautiful.

25:48.453 --> 25:50.319
Ew! You guys are gross.

25:50.355 --> 25:53.256
Julie, one day, you're
gonna love somebody

25:53.291 --> 25:55.625
as much as I love your father.

25:55.660 --> 25:58.669
- Never. Boys are dumb.
- Are not.

26:01.332 --> 26:03.399

26:06.104 --> 26:08.404
You feeling okay, honey?

26:10.775 --> 26:12.475
Just glad to be here.

26:12.510 --> 26:14.343

26:15.213 --> 26:17.113
I love you so much.

26:17.148 --> 26:20.116
(music distorts)

26:20.151 --> 26:21.818
Does that mean we can get a dog?

26:21.853 --> 26:23.319

27:08.666 --> 27:10.833
I need to get back to them. To her.

If you're so desperate to have
Thompkins and the two kids,

27:16.708 --> 27:19.709
why are you in that crappy
apartment playing private dick?

27:19.744 --> 27:21.677
Let go of me. You don't
know what the hell

27:21.746 --> 27:23.780
you're talking about.
I know you're lost.

27:23.815 --> 27:25.214
You want to find your way home?

27:25.250 --> 27:27.116
Play nice.

27:32.423 --> 27:34.924
It's a long way to the basement.

27:36.060 --> 27:37.994
(elevator creaks)

27:54.130 --> 27:55.930
So...

27:56.966 --> 27:59.433
The little minx was a no-show.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.902
Well, it seems a frightful shame to let

28:01.938 --> 28:03.938
this beautiful meal go to waste.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.574
What say we wrap it up and
have it for lunch tomorrow?

28:07.610 --> 28:09.777
Hey?

28:13.279 --> 28:15.716
You always bring your
butler along on dates?

28:23.259 --> 28:24.259
Right.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.540
I'll leave you to it.

28:27.888 --> 28:29.463
Excuse me, miss.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.801
You're late.

28:33.836 --> 28:35.688
Stuff came up.

28:36.103 --> 28:38.072
Geez. Chill.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.673
(chuckles softly)

28:39.709 --> 28:42.364
- Alfred really outdid himself.
- I made all of it.

28:42.859 --> 28:43.859
For you.

28:43.895 --> 28:46.061
What's with the attitude?

28:46.882 --> 28:48.497
You stood me up.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.466
I got busy.

28:50.501 --> 28:52.768
Selina, if we're gonna do this,

28:52.804 --> 28:55.004
whatever this is,

28:55.039 --> 28:56.939
I need you to be honest with me.

29:01.012 --> 29:02.511
This?

29:02.547 --> 29:03.847
Me and you.

29:05.859 --> 29:07.917
It's weird for me.

29:09.053 --> 29:11.253
Okay?

29:11.289 --> 29:13.656
It's weird for me.

29:14.725 --> 29:17.293
It's weird for me, too.

29:17.328 --> 29:18.460
So...

29:18.496 --> 29:20.909
are you gonna cut the cake, or what?

29:21.699 --> 29:23.399
(chuckles)

29:23.434 --> 29:26.168
(dishes clatter)

29:29.207 --> 29:32.074
Of course, I didn't want to
stand in the way of love, but...

29:32.109 --> 29:34.243
this woman would have been a disaster.

29:34.278 --> 29:36.679
It sounds as if you did
your friend a favor.

29:36.714 --> 29:40.316
(chuckles) I'm sorry, I
have been talking so much.

29:40.351 --> 29:42.818
I never asked your name.

29:42.854 --> 29:45.187
Kathryn.

29:45.223 --> 29:46.889
Just Kathryn.

29:46.924 --> 29:48.958
- Mm-hmm.
- (laughs)

29:48.993 --> 29:51.393
How did you end up at
the Founders' dinner?

29:51.429 --> 29:53.295
If it's not rude of me to ask.

29:53.331 --> 29:54.530
Not at all.

29:54.565 --> 29:57.900
I'm from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

29:57.935 --> 30:01.203
And I'm part of a group which...

30:01.239 --> 30:03.621
oversees things.

30:04.275 --> 30:06.675
What sort of things?

30:06.711 --> 30:09.511
Everything that matters in Gotham.

30:09.547 --> 30:12.681
We've had our eye on you for some time,

30:12.717 --> 30:14.528
Mr. Cobblepot.

30:15.453 --> 30:17.653
- Who exactly are you?
- (dinner bell rings)

30:20.191 --> 30:23.125
We'll contact you when
the time is right.

30:24.896 --> 30:26.795
Enjoy your evening.

30:36.741 --> 30:39.541
(indistinct chatter)

30:41.679 --> 30:42.912
Excuse me,

30:42.947 --> 30:44.947
did you notice the rather...

30:44.982 --> 30:47.583
severe-looking woman
I was speaking with?

30:47.618 --> 30:48.918
She said her name...

30:48.953 --> 30:51.820
(gunshots, screaming)

30:51.856 --> 30:54.189
- What is this? What is going on?
- (gun cocks)

30:54.225 --> 30:56.058
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked,

30:56.093 --> 30:58.260
Mr. Mayor.

30:58.296 --> 31:00.729
I see the champagne didn't leave a mark.

31:00.765 --> 31:02.598
- I'm so glad.
- (grunts)

31:02.633 --> 31:04.934
For those of you who don't know me,

31:04.969 --> 31:08.237
my name is Jervis Tetch.

31:08.272 --> 31:10.306
I promise not to take up
too much of your time.

31:10.341 --> 31:11.974
But the fact is, you...

31:12.009 --> 31:14.143
are the heads of Gotham.

31:14.178 --> 31:15.444
And tonight

31:15.479 --> 31:18.547
the heads of Gotham will roll.

31:20.318 --> 31:22.751
But first...

31:22.787 --> 31:23.919
a toast.

31:23.955 --> 31:26.655
A drink to your health.

31:26.691 --> 31:28.757
And if we don't?

31:28.793 --> 31:32.328
Change, my friends, is nigh.

31:32.363 --> 31:33.495
Drink the wine...

31:33.531 --> 31:36.832
- (gun clicks)
- or else you die.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.901
(exhales)

31:45.109 --> 31:46.175
BULLOCK: Glasses down now!

31:46.210 --> 31:47.710
(screaming) Glasses down!

31:52.616 --> 31:54.950
(grunts)

31:54.986 --> 31:56.952
(heart beating)

31:56.988 --> 31:59.455
Oh, my...

31:59.490 --> 32:01.924
Is that my dear sister I see?

32:01.959 --> 32:04.526
(chuckling): Oh!

32:04.562 --> 32:06.328
She's in you, isn't she? (laughs)

32:08.331 --> 32:09.331
What fun!

32:09.367 --> 32:11.633
(laughs) What fun!

32:11.669 --> 32:13.435
(grunts)

32:13.471 --> 32:14.503
Shut up!

32:14.538 --> 32:16.839
Shut up!

32:22.979 --> 32:23.979
(distorted elevator ding)

32:24.015 --> 32:27.049
Last stop.

32:28.534 --> 32:30.285
Don't be scared.

32:35.673 --> 32:38.660
It's not easy to face
who you really are.

32:41.065 --> 32:43.032
I should know.

32:47.405 --> 32:50.873
Do you ever wish you were
the person you used to be?

32:54.245 --> 32:55.878
Do you?

33:09.360 --> 33:10.526
Use this.

33:13.497 --> 33:14.930
Or don't.

33:14.965 --> 33:16.865
It's up to you.

33:20.104 --> 33:21.461
Good luck, Jim.

33:47.932 --> 33:49.398
Sir...

33:51.535 --> 33:54.670
Sir, I think you're looking for this?

33:58.375 --> 33:59.675
Dad?

33:59.710 --> 34:01.096
Hey!

34:01.453 --> 34:03.178
It's good to see you, son.

34:04.595 --> 34:06.849
I'm always losing that darn thing.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.152
Get in. We don't want to be late.

34:12.857 --> 34:14.523
NURSE: <i>Doctor? Doctor?</i>

34:14.558 --> 34:15.724
<i>Some help.</i>

34:15.759 --> 34:17.159
<i>Doctor, he's unconscious.</i>

34:17.194 --> 34:20.027
Dr. Calvi, he's in here.

34:20.063 --> 34:21.463
Jim?

34:21.498 --> 34:22.664
Jim.

34:22.699 --> 34:23.931
NURSE: This was beside him.

34:26.337 --> 34:27.735
"Red Queen."

34:27.771 --> 34:29.237
I've heard of this.

34:29.273 --> 34:31.507
Get me 20cc's of Haloperidol.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.742
- Right away, Doctor.
- Jim, can you hear me?

34:33.777 --> 34:34.996
- (door opens)
- Jim.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.897
Jim!

34:40.583 --> 34:42.351
Come on, Jimmy,

34:42.386 --> 34:44.719
it's time to go.

35:03.991 --> 35:05.824
Something wrong?

35:05.860 --> 35:08.494
No.

35:08.529 --> 35:09.862
I'm just glad to see you.

35:09.897 --> 35:11.797
I missed you a lot.

35:11.832 --> 35:13.799
Yeah, sorry I haven't been around more.

35:13.834 --> 35:15.100
Heard you got into some kind of trouble.

35:15.136 --> 35:16.969
You want to talk about it?

35:19.640 --> 35:21.707
When I was a kid,

35:21.742 --> 35:25.210
people would tell me,
"Your dad's a hero."

35:26.714 --> 35:28.680
All I knew is you went
to court every day,

35:28.716 --> 35:29.848
and every night you came home

35:29.884 --> 35:32.951
and you played ball with
me while Mom made dinner.

35:34.288 --> 35:36.789
Then I got older

35:36.824 --> 35:39.491
and I understood you were a hero.

35:40.995 --> 35:44.263
Only for me, it wasn't just
that you'd been a great D.A.

35:45.766 --> 35:49.635
It was that you got up day after day,

35:49.670 --> 35:52.337
you faced down the worst
the city had to offer,

35:52.373 --> 35:56.041
but you never brought
that home to Mom and me.

35:56.076 --> 35:58.277
You protected us.

36:00.181 --> 36:02.281
I wanted to be just like you.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.986
Turns out I'm the opposite.

36:09.356 --> 36:11.757
I destroy everything
and everyone around me.

36:11.792 --> 36:12.958
(scoffs): Come on, Jimmy,

36:14.215 --> 36:16.428
I'm far from perfect.

36:16.464 --> 36:18.530
I got plenty of darkness inside me,

36:18.566 --> 36:19.998
I just don't dwell on it.

36:20.034 --> 36:22.000
Focus on the good you can
do. That's what counts.

36:22.036 --> 36:23.962
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- No.

36:23.985 --> 36:25.637
Been hiding behind self-righteous

36:25.673 --> 36:29.208
lone wolf nonsense
because you're afraid.

36:29.243 --> 36:31.109
Why is that?

36:31.145 --> 36:33.779
The badge holds expectations.

36:33.814 --> 36:36.548
People want a hero. And I'm not.

36:36.584 --> 36:38.749
You know what makes a hero, son?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.787
A man who values protecting others

36:41.822 --> 36:43.689
above protecting himself.

36:43.724 --> 36:45.457
A man who knows his limits
but isn't afraid to fail.

36:45.493 --> 36:48.160
A man who knows when to ask
for help when he needs it.

36:48.195 --> 36:51.196
Now... (chuckles) I-I
wasn't always that man,

36:51.232 --> 36:53.632
but damn, that didn't
stop me from trying.

36:54.571 --> 36:57.936
- I don't know how to be that man.
- Well, sure you do.

36:57.972 --> 37:00.706
Just got to follow the code.

37:00.741 --> 37:02.875
What... you remember what that is?

37:03.565 --> 37:04.810
No.

37:04.845 --> 37:07.179
The code we Gordons promise to live by?

37:07.214 --> 37:09.047
No. Why can't I remember?

37:09.083 --> 37:11.683
Because you're lost, son.

37:11.719 --> 37:13.519
If you want to find your way back home,

37:13.554 --> 37:15.811
the answer you're looking
for is in my ring.

37:17.758 --> 37:20.058
Ah... shoot.

37:20.094 --> 37:21.426
It's time for me to go.

37:21.462 --> 37:23.161
No. I want to talk to you more.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.097
No, I can't. Someone's coming for me.

37:25.165 --> 37:26.431
No, Dad.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.367
No, Dad, please. Don't go. No, Dad!

37:28.402 --> 37:29.401
(horn honking) I'm proud of you, Jimmy.

37:29.436 --> 37:30.841
Dad!

37:31.601 --> 37:33.272
Jim?

37:33.307 --> 37:35.541
Jim, can you hear me? Jim.

37:35.576 --> 37:37.743
Yeah.

37:37.778 --> 37:39.545
Yeah, I can hear you.

37:39.580 --> 37:40.612
(light clicks off)

37:40.648 --> 37:42.948
(grunts)

37:42.983 --> 37:45.183
It's Haloperidol,

37:45.219 --> 37:46.952
an antipsychotic.

37:46.987 --> 37:50.055
You were dosed with a pretty
powerful hallucinogen.

37:50.090 --> 37:51.957
- It was Tetch.
- I know.

37:51.992 --> 37:54.226
Someone saw him leaving the hospital.

37:54.261 --> 37:56.228
You know, you're lucky.

37:56.263 --> 37:57.931
Another minute, we would have lost you.

38:01.138 --> 38:02.901
Thank you.

38:02.937 --> 38:04.169
It's my job.

38:04.204 --> 38:06.104
NURSE: Dr. Calvi?

38:06.140 --> 38:07.072
We need your signature, please.

38:07.107 --> 38:08.473
Uh-huh.

38:08.509 --> 38:10.909
I'll get somebody to take the I.V. out.

38:10.945 --> 38:14.079
Half an hour, a glass of orange juice,

38:14.114 --> 38:16.348
you'll be good to go.

38:26.493 --> 38:29.294
(insects chirping)

38:29.330 --> 38:32.230
NYGMA: (scoffs) So while I did...

38:32.266 --> 38:35.233
kill my girlfriend,

38:35.269 --> 38:37.336
who does look rather similar to you,

38:37.371 --> 38:39.938
it was not out of malice or intent.

38:39.974 --> 38:42.474
It was an accident that I deeply regret.

38:42.509 --> 38:44.048
And I was not gonna tell
you this, but then...

38:44.094 --> 38:45.744
Edward,

38:45.779 --> 38:47.846
I know what you did.

38:47.881 --> 38:49.982
You do?

38:50.017 --> 38:53.201
I spent the afternoon reading
every article about you.

38:54.794 --> 38:57.889
You know what I did and yet

38:57.925 --> 38:59.858
you still came on this date anyway?

39:00.860 --> 39:01.860
Well...

39:01.895 --> 39:04.129
That's not logical.

39:04.164 --> 39:05.842
Love isn't logical.

39:11.171 --> 39:14.381
I've lived my whole life
inside the pages of books.

39:16.113 --> 39:17.898
Any other men I've dated,

39:19.380 --> 39:22.506
they didn't compare to the
lovers I spent my life with:

39:23.917 --> 39:27.819
Anthony, Cleopatra,

39:27.855 --> 39:30.022
Romeo and Juliet,

39:30.057 --> 39:33.360
Othello and Desdemona.

39:34.695 --> 39:37.262
All of whom died.

39:37.297 --> 39:38.973
Edward,

39:39.814 --> 39:41.587
you're the first to measure up.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.128
You're the one I waited for.

39:46.373 --> 39:48.240
You're not scared of me?

39:48.275 --> 39:50.442
Of course I am.

39:51.369 --> 39:53.512
Can you feel how fast
my heart's beating?

40:05.244 --> 40:06.658
OSWALD: Well, Ed,

40:06.694 --> 40:08.427
you would not believe the night...

40:08.462 --> 40:10.762
Oswald, good evening.

40:13.233 --> 40:15.167
This is Isabella.

40:15.202 --> 40:16.168
(sighs)

40:16.203 --> 40:18.060
Oh...

40:18.497 --> 40:20.272
we have met.

40:20.307 --> 40:21.940
- (Oswald chuckles)
- Mm.

40:21.975 --> 40:24.009
Would you excuse me?

40:24.044 --> 40:27.245
I am very tired.

40:49.970 --> 40:51.937
(distant siren wailing)

41:09.184 --> 41:13.925
<i>"Dum spiramus tuebimur."</i>

41:18.232 --> 41:20.966
While we breathe,

41:21.001 --> 41:23.702
we shall defend.

41:32.613 --> 41:33.613
(knocking)

41:35.816 --> 41:37.015
- Come in.
- (door opens)

41:37.050 --> 41:39.317
You busy?

41:39.353 --> 41:41.119
Just finishing up some
paperwork on Tetch.

41:41.155 --> 41:43.789
He and the Tweeds are
safe and sound in Arkham.

41:43.824 --> 41:45.991
Hopefully, that's the
last we'll hear from them.

41:46.026 --> 41:47.592
Congratulations.

41:48.695 --> 41:51.596
You did what I couldn't. I mean that.

41:51.632 --> 41:53.198
A humble Jim Gordon.

41:53.233 --> 41:54.533
What do you know?

41:56.069 --> 41:59.339
I hear Tetch sent you on quite a trip.

41:59.420 --> 42:01.973
If it wasn't for Mario, I'd be dead.

42:02.009 --> 42:05.177
Anyway, I'm not here about that.

42:08.248 --> 42:10.682
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

42:12.486 --> 42:14.853
Why the sudden change of heart?

42:15.866 --> 42:19.057
I made a promise to
someone when I was younger.

42:20.527 --> 42:23.562
I intend to keep that promise.

42:27.067 --> 42:29.100
Good.

42:30.204 --> 42:31.503
We need you here.

42:32.573 --> 42:34.039
I need you here.

42:36.243 --> 42:38.276
Welcome back, Detective.

42:45.787 --> 42:47.285
MAN: It seems you left dinner

42:47.321 --> 42:48.653
just in time.

42:48.689 --> 42:51.256
Indeed.

42:51.291 --> 42:53.992
And what did you think of our new mayor?

42:54.027 --> 42:59.097
My gut says once a
criminal, always a criminal.

42:59.132 --> 43:01.166
We'll keep an eye on him.

43:02.736 --> 43:05.737
Judgment is coming, Kathryn.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.708
For all of us.
