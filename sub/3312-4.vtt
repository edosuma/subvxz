WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:09.377
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.612 --> 00:15.216
I'M LEAVING, IF ANYONE NEEDS ME.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.485
- HEY, AUNT MEL.
- OH, JEEZ.

00:17.518 --> 00:21.155
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?
- YEAH, SURE, MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.324
EXCEPT RIGHT NOW. I'M SLAMMING
IT SHUT BEHIND ME. BYE.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.560
WAIT. WHAT? NO, BUT
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.230
MY FRIEND SCARLETT GOT...

00:29.263 --> 00:30.598
A BOYFRIEND.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.534
OH, MY GOD. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA SAY IMPLANTS.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.569
BECAUSE YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE,

00:35.603 --> 00:38.139
AND THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.540
NO, LOOK, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.477
HER BOYFRIEND IS ALWAYS WITH HER
AND HE ACTS SO STRANGE AROUND ME.

00:43.511 --> 00:47.115
OKAY, WELL, INVITE THEM BOTH
OVER AND MAKE NICE WITH THE GUY.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.517
'CAUSE BOYFRIENDS COME AND GO,
BUT FRIENDSHIPS LAST FOR MONTHS.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.152
SEE YA.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.155
AUNT MEL, I NEED YOU.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.524
HOLLY'S BIRTHDAY IS IN THREE DAYS AND
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN HER A PRESENT YET.

00:56.557 --> 01:00.228
GET HER ONE OF THOSE EDIBLE BOUQUETS
WITH THE CHOCOLATE COVERED FRUIT.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.629
YEAH, SHE'LL LOVE IT. AND IF
SHE DOESN'T, I'LL EAT IT,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.864
'CAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE GREAT.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.201
- I NEED A REAL IDEA.
- OKAY, COME BACK WHEN YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.638
SHE'S HELPING ME RIGHT NOW. OKAY,
SO WHAT DO I WHEN THEY COME OVER?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.607
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS THAT YOU GO AWAY...

01:13.641 --> 01:16.577
I MEAN, GO UPSTAIRS AND CALL
SCARLETT QUICK QUICK QUICK.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.445
YEAH.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.380
OKAY. BACK TO ME.
WHAT DO I GET HOLLY?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.216
YOU KNOW, THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT
THING I NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:22.250 --> 01:24.285
BECAUSE IT'S A
CRITICAL DECISION.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.519
IT'S GONNA TAKE A
LOT OF THOUGHT.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.288
BURKE, I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.656
IT'D JUST BE SO NICE,
AFTER I WORK OUT,

01:28.689 --> 01:31.659
IF I COULD MAYBE GET ONE,
TWO GALLONS OF HOT WATER.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.129
SOMEBODY NEEDS ATTENTION.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.665
SOMEBODY NEEDS SOME HOT WATER.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.401
I BET THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THAT CALL FROM THE GAS COMPANY.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.635
WHAT CALL FROM THE GAS COMPANY?

01:41.669 --> 01:43.304
THE REALLY ANGRY-SOUNDING ONE.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.439
I WROTE IT DOWN ON A PIECE
OF PAPER AND EVERYTHING.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.675
BURKE, I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU
FORGOT TO PAY THE GAS BILL.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.444
I DIDN'T FORGET. I PAY
THEM WHEN I SEE THEM.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.146
THE BILLS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE RIGHT HERE.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.416
BUT EVER SINCE THE RENOVATION,
THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.652
PEOPLE KEEP MOVING STUFF.
PEOPLE.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.920
THERE'S A BUNCH OF MAIL IN HERE.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.656
AND OH, LOOK... A NOTE THAT SAYS, "GAS CO.
CALLED, URGE."

02:02.690 --> 02:04.325
SEE? I TOLD YOU I WROTE IT DOWN.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.694
YOU GUYS CANNOT PIN
ANY OF THIS ON ME.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.696
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A TON OF
THESE OVERDUE NOTICES IN HERE.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.897
THAT'S IT, FROM NOW ON,

02:09.930 --> 02:12.466
I AM TAKING OVER ALL THE
BILL-PAYING RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.435
FINE, JOE, YOU CAN
HANDLE MY MONEY.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.337
JUST DON'T GET SWINDLED OUT
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:16.370 --> 02:18.172
AND LEAD US INTO FINANCIAL RUIN.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.174
OH, THAT'S SO FUNNY

02:20.208 --> 02:22.476
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME.

02:22.510 --> 02:26.347
AND IF YOU GO TO THE STORE, CAN YOU
GET SOME MUCH BIGGER TOWELS? MUCH.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.682
YOU DO KNOW THAT'S NOT
AN INSULT, RIGHT?

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LITTLE
MORE RESEARCH. THANK YOU.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.282
STEWART, WAIT, I HAVE ONE MORE LEGAL
ISSUE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU PRIVATELY.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.984
I LOOK FORWARD TO
THAT, COUNCILWOMAN.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.986
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FOOD
TRUCKS ARE OUT THERE TODAY?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.956
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S THE BACON-WRAPPED
TACO TRUCK. I'M STARVING.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.391
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
CAN WE REALLY EAT

03:10.424 --> 03:14.228
AT THE BACON-WRAPPED TACO TRUCK AND
REMAIN IMPARTIAL ON THIS ISSUE?

03:14.262 --> 03:16.697
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S WRONG. IF
IT'S WRAPPED IN BACON, IT'S RIGHT.

03:16.730 --> 03:20.468
VERY CONVINCING ARGUMENT.
LET'S EAT.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.237
BURKE, HEY, LOOK, DO ME A FAVOR.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.005
TALK TO MY FRIEND
STEVE HERE IN INDIA.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.708
LET HIM KNOW I'M AUTHORIZED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT, PLEASE.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.577
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
HIM YOU'RE MEL BURKE?

03:29.610 --> 03:33.247
BECAUSE I'M AN HONEST PERSON.
AND I ALREADY TRIED THAT.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.682
FINE.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.652
I AUTHORIZE JOE LONGO TO...
AND WE'RE ON HOLD.

03:38.686 --> 03:42.690
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD "I
LIKE BIG BUTTS" SUNG IN HINDI.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.325
SO LOOK, I WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR BILLS.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.260
WE NEED TO DO SOME
SERIOUS STREAMLINING.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.428
JOE, THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.730
OH, I'M SORRY. AM
I INTERRUPTING?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.532
YEAH, BUT AT LEAST
YOU'RE WEARING PANTS.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.534
STEWART, THIS IS JOE, MY NANNY.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.303
DOMESTIC MANAGER. HI.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.770
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEP.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.171
( cell phone rings )

03:58.205 --> 04:00.774
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME GRAB THIS AND
I'LL BE BACK TO GRAB YOU FOR LUNCH.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.611
I'LL BE READY TO BE GRABBED.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.314
OH, YES, STEVE, THAT IS
THE YEAR I WAS BORN,

04:06.347 --> 04:09.617
OR WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR.

04:09.650 --> 04:13.053
HEY, HONEY. YEAH, SURE,
I CAN PICK UP THE KIDS.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.756
NO, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
I'M WORKING.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.491
STEVE, I'VE GOTTA GO.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.060
OKAY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE
SOUND OF MY GROWLING STOMACH.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.663
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.499
YOU HAVE MY PHONE. DON'T WORRY.
ALL RIGHT?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.601
I'M GONNA HELP YOU TRIM THE
FAT OUT OF YOUR BILLS.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.804
- SHALL WE?
- DEFINITELY. FINE, TRIM.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.574
BUT REMEMBER, WINE AND SHOES ARE NEVER FAT.
DO NOT TOUCH THEM.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.276
WHAT IS THIS, MY FIRST DAY?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.682
( doorbell rings )

04:42.883 --> 04:45.553
SCARLETT.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.590
AND HERE'S HASKELL, TOO.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.825
YAY, HASKELL.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.761
HEY.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.866
- THANKS FOR INVITING US OVER.
- SURE.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.735
ANYTHING FOR MY FRIENDS.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.605
SO WHAT ARE THE THREE
OF US GONNA DO?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.340
WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA PEE

05:06.374 --> 05:08.709
AND YOU TWO TALK
AMONGST YOURSELVES.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.550
SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN GROWING YOUR HAIR OUT.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.787
YEAH, NOT SURE IF I
SHOULD CUT IT OR KEEP IT.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.755
ONE OF LIFE'S BIG DECISIONS.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.891
YEP.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.895
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M TRYING TO SEE IF
WE CAN HAVE A REGULAR CONVERSATION

05:27.928 --> 05:31.098
YOU KNOW, WITH, LIKE, EYE
CONTACT AND EVERYTHING.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.933
ALL RIGHT.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.838
WELL, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN CONNECT ON.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.474
TELL ME YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.376
OKAY.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.812
I LIKE HIP-HOP, AND
I'M AFRAID OF SHARKS.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.381
THAT'S SO WEIRD BECAUSE
I LIKE SHARKS,

05:47.415 --> 05:49.617
BUT I'M AFRAID OF HIP-HOP.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.919
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT SO BAD.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.888
REALLY? SO YOU THINK YOU
MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE ME?

05:54.922 --> 05:57.658
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.394
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. I HOPE
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ME SOUND WEIRD.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.730
WEIRD. I LIKE WEIRD.
LET'S HEAR IT.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.832
I KIND OF SIT BEHIND
YOU IN MATH CLASS,

06:04.865 --> 06:08.602
AND I LOOK AT YOUR NECK A LOT.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.506
YOU HAVE THE CUTEST
NECK I'VE EVER SEEN.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.142
OKAY, MAYBE I DON'T LIKE WEIRD.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.812
HEY, SCARLETT, YOU DONE PEEING YET?
'CAUSE WE NEED YOU OUT HERE.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.848
WAIT, I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.215
I FEEL LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT.

06:22.249 --> 06:25.953
LOOK AT YOU TWO BEST BUDS HANGING OUT.
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.688
I WAS THINKING LASER TAG.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.957
GREAT. LET ME GET MY SCARF.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.859
MY BIG OLD SCARF.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.832
- HOW'S THE BILL PAYING GOING?
- IT'S GOING FINE.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.434
I GOT A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.970
I'M GONNA CANCEL ONE OF YOUR
THREE GYM MEMBERSHIPS HERE.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.439
SO WHICH ONE OF THESE DO
YOU NOT GO TO THE MOST?

06:45.473 --> 06:46.974
OOH, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.843
YEAH, JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.
OKAY, ALL GONE.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.814
BY THE WAY, HOW WAS YOUR BUSINESS
LUNCH WITH MR. ARMANI SUIT?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.949
HIS NAME IS STEWART, AND HE'S
THE ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.851
- VERY NICE GUY.
- OH, IS HE NICE?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.788
YEAH, HE SEEMS NICE. AND THE TWO
OF YOU GUYS SEEMED REAL CHUMMY.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.691
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS, I'M SURE, CHUMMING
IT UP DOWN THERE AT WORK, YOU KNOW?

07:03.724 --> 07:07.194
WELL, PEOPLE LIKE ME,
AND I SMELL GOOD.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.562
AND NO ONE DOWN THERE AT
THE OFFICE WAS CONCERNED

07:08.596 --> 07:11.765
ABOUT A MARRIED MAN HAVING LUNCH
WITH AN ATTRACTIVE SINGLE WOMAN?

07:11.799 --> 07:15.002
YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.004
LET'S STAY ON TOPIC HERE, OKAY?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.840
JOE, SINGLE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED
TO TALK TO MARRIED PEOPLE.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.576
I KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING
IT LOOKS A LITTLE FUNKY,

07:22.610 --> 07:23.977
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE HINKY.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.614
IT IS NEITHER FUNKY NOR HINKY,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
BUT LET'S GET BACK TO
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT HERE.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.017
SO ON YOUR ATTRACTIVENESS
SCALE, WHERE AM I?

07:30.050 --> 07:33.521
LIKE 8, 9, 11?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.857
I GOTTA GO PAY BILLS.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.892
HA HA. 11.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.032
$80 FOR A BRAZILIAN WAX?

07:45.065 --> 07:48.536
WHAT, DID SHE GO TO RIO
TO GET THIS THING DONE?

07:48.569 --> 07:52.239
"WIL-GRND-INC. WIL-GRND-INC."

07:52.272 --> 07:55.809
WHAT THE HECK ARE ALL THESE
CHARGES ON HERE FOR WIL-GRND-INC?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.584
WILTON GRAND HOTEL, THE
JEWEL OF DOWNTOWN TOLEDO.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.985
HOW MAY I BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.654
I'M SORRY, DID YOU
JUST SAY "HOTEL"?

08:06.687 --> 08:09.790
I SAID, "WILTON GRAND HOTEL,
JEWEL OF DOWNTOWN TOLEDO.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.526
- HOW MAY I BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY?"
- I GOT IT. THANK YOU.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.262
YES, I'M ACTUALLY CALLING
ON BEHALF OF A MEL BURKE.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.798
I'M CALLING ABOUT THESE
RECURRING CHARGES

08:17.831 --> 08:19.667
ON MS. BURKE'S CREDIT
CARD STATEMENT.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.069
WE KNOW MS. BURKE VERY WELL. I'M
HAPPY TO CHECK FOR YOU, SIR.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.938
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WHAT
KIND OF LUNCHES ARE THESE?

08:24.972 --> 08:27.541
ALL THE LOBSTER YOU CAN
PUT IN YOUR PURSE?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.877
- ( computer beeps )
- NO, SIR, THESE ARE ALL ROOM CHARGES.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.945
ROOM CHARGES? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.014
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OVERNIGHT
STAYS ON THESE DAYS.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.616
MS. BURKE NEVER STAYS THE NIGHT.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.018
SHE ALWAYS CHECKS OUT
AFTER A FEW HOURS.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.058
THANK YOU FOR THE EVIDENCE...
ASSISTANCE.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.736
LENNOX.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.706
I KNOW, I KNOW. I
LOOK RIDICULOUS.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.842
BUT APPARENTLY MY NECK HAS STIRRED
UP A LOT OF BAD FEELINGS.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.878
SO IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE
IF I KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.648
GREAT, GOOD THINKING, LISTEN,

09:07.681 --> 09:08.916
I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUT
WHAT I BOUGHT FOR HOLLY.

09:08.949 --> 09:12.753
I NEED A WOMAN'S OPINION AND
YOU'RE THE CLOSEST THING I'VE GOT.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.723
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT IT, WHY
DON'T YOU JUST GET HER A GIFT CARD?

09:15.756 --> 09:19.660
A GIFT CARD? SERIOUSLY? WHY
DON'T I JUST BREAK MY OWN NOSE?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.762
ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, LET'S SEE IT.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.900
IT'S CUTE.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.702
I HOPE SO.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.839
I REALLY WANT HOLLY TO BE HAPPY
BECAUSE WHEN HOLLY'S NOT HAPPY,

09:31.872 --> 09:34.742
NOBODY'S HAPPY.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.610
SHE'S A LUCKY GIRL.
YOU KNOW THAT?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.879
'CAUSE YOU'D NEVER LOOK AT
ANOTHER GIRL'S NECK, WOULD YOU?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.915
HOLLY DOESN'T EVEN LET
ME LOOK AT HER NECK.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.917
YOU'RE SWEET.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.987
AND GOOFY. KEEP WORKING THAT.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.166
OH!

09:59.199 --> 10:01.068
WHY ARE YOU SO JUMPY?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.772
'CAUSE YOU JUST APPEARED OUT OF
NOWHERE LIKE A REALLY CREEPY WAITER.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.708
LISTEN, I WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT HERE.

10:07.741 --> 10:11.712
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THIS RECURRING
CHARGE AT THE WILTON GRAND HOTEL.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.947
THAT MUST BE SOME
OTHER MEL BURKE.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.716
THAT'S NOT HOW
CREDIT CARDS WORK.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.085
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMETIMES, I GO THERE FOR LUNCH.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.955
AND I TIP, LIKE, 300%, 400%.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.290
NO, THESE ARE IN
FACT ROOM CHARGES,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.693
WHICH IS KIND OF STRANGE BECAUSE YOU
LIVE HERE, SO THERE'S NO REASON

10:25.726 --> 10:27.661
YOU'D HAVE TO GO SOMEPLACE
ELSE THAT HAS A BED

10:27.695 --> 10:29.830
AND A SHOWER FOR AFTERWARDS.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.965
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- IT'S THAT ARMANI SUIT GUY, ISN'T IT?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.967
- WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?
- WHAT AM I SUGGESTING?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.903
I'M SUGGESTING THAT YOU'RE
SNEAKING OFF TO THIS HOTEL

10:35.936 --> 10:38.071
- TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE ASHAMED OF.
- WHAT?

10:38.105 --> 10:41.709
WHAT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...
IT. YOU KNOW, MAN, WOMAN.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.943
IT.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.812
IT? WE'RE ALL THE WAY TO IT?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.080
SO NOW HE AND I ARE IT-ING?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.816
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S A CRAZY THEORY.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.083
LET'S JUST GO BACK TO THE BIG TIP STORY.
WHAT WAS IT, 400%?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.952
CAN I GET A TIP LIKE THAT?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.053
OKAY, I GOT A TIP FOR YOU.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.055
HOW ABOUT YOU PAY THE BILLS
AND STOP ASKING QUESTIONS?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.757
YOU KNOW WHO SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT?
GUILTY PEOPLE.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.860
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA DIGNIFY YOUR
ACCUSATION WITH A RESPONSE.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.762
THAT LITTLE EYE ROLL THING YOU
JUST DID, THAT WAS A RESPONSE.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.831
OKAY, LOOK, I CAN
HANDLE MY OWN AFFAIRS.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.734
AFFAIRS! YOU JUST
SAID "AFFAIRS," BABY.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.769
IT WAS A WORD, LONGO,
A SLIP OF THE TONGUE.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.704
SPARE ME THE FILTHY DETAILS.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.046
- I WAS JUST GOING TO...
- YEAH, I DON'T WANNA KNOW. HAVE FUN.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.981
WHO SAYS I'M HAVING FUN?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.716
NO ONE, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE FUN, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.151
JUST GO.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.686
FUN YOUR BRAINS OUT.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.759
WAS THAT AUNT MEL? I
NEED TO TALK TO HER.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.028
SHE LEFT. SO HERE'S A NOVEL IDEA...
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.030
ALL RIGHT? I GOT A TON
OF LIFE EXPERIENCE.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.734
PLUS I'M RIGHT LIKE
90% OF THE TIME.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.036
WELL, OKAY.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.239
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND SCARLETT?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.008
I TRIED TO MAKE FRIENDS
WITH HER BOYFRIEND

11:48.041 --> 11:50.477
AND THEN HE TRIED TO MAKE
MORE-THAN-FRIENDS WITH ME.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.913
TRYING TO STRETCH A SINGLE
INTO A DOUBLE, HUH?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.281
YEAH, GUYS ARE GONNA DO THAT.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.049
DID YOU TELL SCARLETT?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.852
NO, SHE'LL THINK I'M
TRYING TO BREAK 'EM UP.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.088
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T JUST LET HER STICK
WITH SOMEBODY THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE WITH.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.091
I MEAN, SURE, MAYBE
SHE GETS MAD AT YOU.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.994
MAYBE SHE LIES TO YOU
ABOUT OVER-TIPPING

12:07.027 --> 12:09.296
AND THEN RUNS OFF TO DO HER SKEEZY
BUSINESS SOMEWHERE IN A HOTEL NEARBY.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.165
BUT THE POINT IS,

12:12.199 --> 12:14.167
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT
YOU TRIED TO STOP HER, ALL RIGHT,

12:14.201 --> 12:16.103
AND THAT YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.106
OKAY, THAT GOT A LITTLE
CONFUSING IN THE MIDDLE THERE,

12:19.139 --> 12:22.142
BUT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD TELL HER.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.911
IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.046
YEAH, YEAH, I MIGHT.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.782
I MEAN... NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:28.816 --> 12:32.052
I WOULD RIGHT NOW.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.894
I GOT HERE AS QUICK AS I COULD.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.130
WHAT'S UP?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.132
SCARLETT, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY,

12:45.165 --> 12:47.200
AND I'M NOT QUITE
SURE HOW TO SAY IT.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.202
SO JUST HANG IN THERE WITH ME WHILE
I TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS

12:49.236 --> 12:51.338
TO TELL YOU THAT
HASKELL HIT ON ME.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.807
HEY, THAT WAS EASY.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.343
WHAT? REALLY?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.111
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.579
I KNOW. HE HIT ON ME.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.950
HE WANTS TO GET ALL
UP IN MY NECK.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.218
NO, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE HIT ON YOU.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.088
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO
BE FRIENDLY AND...

13:08.121 --> 13:09.222
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "ON YOU,"

13:09.256 --> 13:12.059
LIKE I'M A HAIRLESS
CAT OR SOMETHING?

13:12.092 --> 13:15.595
IT'S JUST YOU'RE NOT HIS TYPE.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.066
- MEANING?
- HASKELL'S INTO GIRLS LIKE ME.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.834
YOU KNOW, SMOKIN' HOT.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.172
WOW!

13:25.205 --> 13:27.274
I HAVE BEEN TORTURING
MYSELF OVER HOW

13:27.307 --> 13:30.110
TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
I ACTUALLY CARE HOW YOU FEEL,

13:30.143 --> 13:33.180
BUT YOU DON'T CARE
HOW I FEEL AT ALL.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.283
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM HOT.
CRAZY HOT.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.852
THIS NECK? IRRESISTIBLE.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.188
OKAY.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.257
YEAH, YOU WISH YOU HAD
A NECK LIKE THIS.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.293
IT GOES ALL THE WAY
UP TO MY EARS.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.364
( doorbell rings )

13:54.167 --> 13:56.904
HI, HOLLY. YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.908
OF COURSE. PUNCTUALITY IS
ONE OF MY SPECIAL SKILLS.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.112
OH, SHIRT!

14:06.213 --> 14:08.148
I MEAN... ( clears throat )

14:08.181 --> 14:12.152
WHEN DID YOU GET THAT?

14:12.185 --> 14:15.222
THIS? OH, I BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.423
DO YOU LIKE IT?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.225
LOVE IT. IT'S GREAT.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.228
IT'S THE SECOND BEST
SHIRT I'VE EVER SEEN.

14:22.329 --> 14:25.298
RYDER, I'M READY TO
RECEIVE MY PRESENT NOW.

14:25.332 --> 14:29.002
WHAT PRESENT?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.004
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
IN YOUR HANDS.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.973
THE ONE WITH THE TAG
ON IT THAT SAYS,

14:33.006 --> 14:36.376
"TO MY SCARY BEAR," YOU
SILLY SQUEAKY MOUSE.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.478
HOLLY, WAIT.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.917
IS THIS THE SAME SHIRT
THAT I'M WEARING?

14:43.951 --> 14:46.219
NO. NO.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.256
YEAH, IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.058
ARE YOU SURE? IT LOOKS
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.194
I MEAN, NIGHT AND DAY.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.064
RYDER.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
I LOVE IT.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.302
LOVE IT? YOU'VE ALREADY GOT IT.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.305
YEAH, YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I LIKE.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.275
AND NOW

15:08.308 --> 15:10.443
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THAT THING YOU LIKE.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.146
I DO LIKE THAT THING.

15:23.490 --> 15:27.294
- Mel: WHO IS IT?
- ROOM SERVICE.

15:28.328 --> 15:32.232
I DEFINITELY DID NOT ORDER THIS.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.334
LONGO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.435
WHAT AM I DOING HERE? I'M
NOT STANDING IDLY BY.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.004
THAT'S WHAT I'M
DOING HERE, OKAY?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.271
'CAUSE FRIENDS LOOK
OUT FOR FRIENDS.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.040
AND I KNOW I'M YOUR
BILL-PAYING-GUY

15:40.073 --> 15:42.375
AND YOUR DOMESTIC MANAGER...

15:42.409 --> 15:45.112
- CAN'T YOU JUST SAY NANNY?
- NO, I CANNOT, NO.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.513
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS NOT
ONLY GONNA HURT YOUR CAREER,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.348
BUT IT'S GONNA HURT A
LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.183
AND I THINK THAT YOU DESERVE

15:50.217 --> 15:53.086
TO BE MORE THAN SOME
GUY'S HOTEL CANDY.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.155
SO I JUST WANTED TO COME
HERE AND TELL YOU THAT.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.257
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

15:57.290 --> 16:00.227
I'M DONE SNEAKING AROUND.
COME ON IN.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.030
- WHAT? NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANNA SEE.
- YEAH, YOU DO.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.364
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.434
I'M COMING IN, MAN. MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S BACK IN ITS HOLSTER.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.372
SO WHERE'S THE GUY?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.773
OH, THE GUY I'M
SLUTTING AROUND WITH?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.276
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.278
HUH?

16:18.311 --> 16:21.281
IT'S TIME TO COME CLEAN
AND REVEAL MY BIG SECRET.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.084
IT'S TRUE. I GET A
ROOM HERE ONCE A WEEK.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.319
FIRST, I SOAK IN THE JACUZZI TUB

16:26.353 --> 16:27.754
WITH THE GINGER-SCENTED
BUBBLE BATH.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.390
THEN, I PUT ON THIS BIG,
SOFT, VELVETY ROBE,

16:30.423 --> 16:33.426
AND I LIE BACK ON SHEETS THAT ARE
LIKE A MILLION THREAD-COUNT.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.328
AND THEN,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.164
I WATCH A CHICK FLICK.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.433
YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF MOVIE
THAT MAKES MEN'S EYES BLEED,

16:40.467 --> 16:44.371
AND I LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.373
I DON'T GET IT.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.774
YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.578
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR...
WITH MYSELF.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.780
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.616
YOU CHECK INTO A HOTEL
TO WATCH A DVD?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.453
- WHY?
- EVERY DAY AT WORK,

17:00.487 --> 17:03.223
I'M SWARMED BY PEOPLE WANTING ME TO
SOLVE PROBLEMS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.393
AND THEN I COME HOME, AND I'M
SWARMED BY YOU AND THE KIDS,

17:06.426 --> 17:09.162
WITH MORE PROBLEMS
AND MORE QUESTIONS.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.531
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
LOVE MY JOB OR MY FAMILY.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.535
IT'S JUST I NEVER GET
A MOMENT TO MYSELF,

17:15.568 --> 17:18.205
YOU KNOW, TO JUST TAKE
A BREATH AND RELAX.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.574
AND ROOM 1208 IS MY OASIS.

17:21.608 --> 17:25.278
AND I JUST BUM-RUSHED
YOUR OASIS.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.580
TOTALLY STOMPED IT.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.849
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.285
ALL RIGHT.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.620
I TELL YOU WHAT. I'M GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.089
AND I PROMISE I'M
NOT GONNA MENTION

17:36.123 --> 17:37.490
YOUR SECRET HIDEAWAY TO ANYBODY.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.459
BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE ME
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MENTION

17:39.492 --> 17:42.095
THAT MY 90% BEING RIGHT AVERAGE

17:42.129 --> 17:43.396
TOOK A MAJOR HIT TODAY.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.432
- DEAL.
- THANK YOU.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.500
OH, ONE LAST THING.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.103
YOU KNOW THIS NICE
HOTEL CHOCOLATE HERE?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.504
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THIS OUT OF THE MINIBAR,

17:51.538 --> 17:54.107
'CAUSE THEY MARK THINGS
UP LIKE CRAZY IN A HOTEL.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.443
JOE, IF YOU DON'T LEAVE, I'M GONNA
OPEN MY ROBE AND FLASH YOU.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.544
NO, THANKS. I'LL
SEE YOU AT HOME.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.361
LENNOX.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.863
I'M SORRY I FREAKED YOU OUT.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.531
I WAS OUT OF LINE THE OTHER DAY,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.133
AND IT SORT OF SET OFF
A CHAIN REACTION.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.401
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.902
SCARLETT AND I BROKE UP.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.573
I'M SORRY, HASKELL, BUT
I HAD TO TELL HER.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.375
NO, WE DIDN'T BREAK UP
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.144
OKAY, THEN I'M LOST.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.545
I'VE WANTED TO ASK
YOU OUT FOREVER,

18:32.579 --> 18:34.514
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE
COURAGE TO TALK TO YOU,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.383
SO I PUT A NOTE IN YOUR LOCKER.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.585
I NEVER GOT A NOTE.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.322
YEAH, TURNED OUT IT WAS
SCARLETT'S LOCKER.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.657
SO I KIND OF HAD
TO FOLLOW THROUGH

18:44.691 --> 18:46.426
AND BE HER BOYFRIEND
FOR A WHILE.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.562
AND WHEN I TOLD HER THAT I'VE
BEEN DATING HER BY ACCIDENT,

18:49.596 --> 18:51.531
SHE DUMPED ME.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.234
YEAH, I CAN SEE HOW
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.438
SO NOW THAT WE'RE BROKEN UP,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.573
IF I WAITED THE
STANDARD THREE MONTHS,

19:00.607 --> 19:04.311
WOULD IT BE OKAY TO ASK YOU OUT?

19:04.344 --> 19:07.480
UM... NO.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.616
I TOTALLY GET IT.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.586
TWO MONTHS. THAT SHOULD DO IT.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.655
GREAT.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.191
YOU KEEP SMILING LIKE THAT,
AND IT'LL BE A WEEK.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.564
( TV playing )

19:24.597 --> 19:26.366
HEY, GUYS, I'M HOME.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.600
- HEY.
- HEY.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.470
SO, RYDER, I THOUGHT OF
A GREAT GIFT FOR HOLLY.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.639
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF. I GAVE
HER A SHIRT SHE ALREADY HAD,

19:32.672 --> 19:35.675
AND SHE GAVE ME A KISS THAT I'M
PRETTY SURE INCLUDED TONGUE.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.380
SURE IT WASN'T GUM THIS TIME?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.549
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
IT WAS TONGUE.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.451
GREAT. SO, LENNOX, HOW
DID IT GO WITH YOU?

19:44.484 --> 19:47.354
DID YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH
SCARLETT'S BOYFRIEND?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.988
I HAVE TO SAY I DID.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.591
GREAT, THEN I AM ALL
CAUGHT UP WITH MY STORIES.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.498
GET OF HERE, GIVE YOUR AUNT
A LITTLE PRIVACY, OKAY?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.233

20:03.403 --> 20:05.672

QUIET, EMPTY LIVING ROOM.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.242
- WELL, THANK YOU, JOE.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.244
AND 22 GUYS WEARING FOOTBALL HELMETS.
MOVE OVER.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.546

20:13.580 --> 20:16.549

20:16.583 --> 20:18.618
SAY YOU LOVE FOOTBALL.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.664

20:35.435 --> 20:39.406
IT'S A SUPER SOFT VELVETY ROBE
LIKE THE ONE AT THE HOTEL

20:39.439 --> 20:41.674

THREAD-COUNT SHEETS?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.443

THE DEPARTMENT STORE SAID

20:43.476 --> 20:45.578
IT'S THE CLOSEST THING
THEY GOT TO A MILLION.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.815

FANCY HOTEL CHOCOLATE YOU LIKE.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.319
I FIGURE YOU COULD EAT IT WHILE
YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR DVD.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.820
JOE, THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.423
NOW YOU CAN HAVE THE
HOTEL EXPERIENCE

20:56.456 --> 20:57.690
IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN ROOM

20:57.724 --> 21:00.293
AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.329
SO THAT'S ALL YOU CARE
ABOUT, MY BOTTOM LINE?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.498
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. ENJOY.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.501
