00:01.308 --> 00:02.508
Nick, go out ten yards,
cut left.

00:02.576 --> 00:03.910
Winston, go long,
post right.

00:03.977 --> 00:06.377
Jess, go down, out
towards the parking lot.

00:06.444 --> 00:07.679
Get in the car.
We'll meet you back at the loft.

00:08.247 --> 00:10.882
Oh, very funny.
You're a comedian, Schmidt.

00:14.551 --> 00:15.552
Hike!

00:18.157 --> 00:20.191
Schmidt! Come on!

00:22.393 --> 00:24.227
- Oh!
- Did you see that?

00:24.295 --> 00:26.830
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm oka--

00:26.898 --> 00:28.665
What is going on?

00:28.732 --> 00:30.901
- Nick... Nick, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God!

00:30.968 --> 00:32.269
This is real!

00:32.336 --> 00:34.337
- Probably your lateral sizer.
- Shut up!

00:34.405 --> 00:37.240
- Can you just...
- Okay, let's go.

00:37.308 --> 00:39.675
- Rotator cuff?
- Can I...?

00:39.742 --> 00:41.043
- What do you need?
- Nothing from you.

00:41.111 --> 00:42.411
Please go far
from me right now.

00:42.478 --> 00:44.046
I can taste my spine.

00:44.114 --> 00:46.248
Three or four down there--
vertebrae.

00:46.316 --> 00:47.817
Why is no one helping me?

00:47.884 --> 00:50.452
Not you! Not you!

01:14.043 --> 01:15.542
Are you sure you're okay?

01:16.109 --> 01:17.577
You're walking
like a Disney witch.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.745
Let me drive you
to your doctor.

01:18.813 --> 01:19.980
I don't have a doctor.

01:20.048 --> 01:21.248
I don't have insurance.

01:21.316 --> 01:22.983
Nick, you need
to see a doctor,

01:23.051 --> 01:25.219
if only to make sure
that your junk is clean.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.519
- I don't go to doctors.
- I'll take you to my friend Sadie.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.355
She'll just look at you--
she won't charge you.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.823
Okay, I don't go to doctors!

01:30.891 --> 01:32.458
Are you sure
you're okay driving?

01:32.525 --> 01:34.393
Yes, I'm fine.
I've never been better.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.661
I'm great.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.563
Thank you.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.765
I feel better already.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.234
See you guys back at the loft.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.734
Oh, my God!

01:42.801 --> 01:44.369
Oh!

01:44.436 --> 01:46.437
- What did you just...?!
- I'm okay.

01:46.505 --> 01:48.740
- I'm okay. Don't worry.
- Oh! What did you do?

01:48.807 --> 01:50.675
You hit my car!

01:50.743 --> 01:52.043
I'm okay.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.745
Oh, Winston, relax.

01:53.812 --> 01:55.313
Okay? Relax.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.948
That's all I did.
I did this.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.648
The rest was already there.

01:58.716 --> 02:00.617
Actually, I think
I undid a dent there.

02:00.685 --> 02:03.020
I'm taking you to see my friend.
Get in my car.

02:03.088 --> 02:04.388
- No... Jess, no. Oh!
- Now!

02:04.455 --> 02:06.490
So she's fitting us
in between patients.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.567 --> 02:19.535
Jess?

02:19.703 --> 02:21.271
Is Sadie a gynecologist?

02:21.338 --> 02:23.339
No, she's an OB/GYN.

02:23.407 --> 02:25.041
- I'm going to go.
- It's a different thing.

02:25.109 --> 02:26.643
I'm going to get out
of here, actually, I think.

02:26.644 --> 02:28.711
Yeah? I don't
think you are.

02:31.314 --> 02:34.182
Nick, she's a wizard
with a speculum.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.751
- Nick!
- I don't have a vagina.

02:36.819 --> 02:38.053
You can take mine.

02:38.121 --> 02:39.721
I heard that, sister.

02:40.289 --> 02:41.756
True dat.

02:41.824 --> 02:43.325
Okay, you know what, Nick?

02:43.393 --> 02:45.193
I'm sorry
that my only doctor friend

02:45.261 --> 02:47.161
is a gynecologist,

02:47.229 --> 02:48.595
but you're broke, so you're

02:48.663 --> 02:50.398
going to have to
shut your mouth,

02:50.465 --> 02:51.899
and you're going
to tag the things

02:51.967 --> 02:53.734
that you want in
this <i>Lucky</i> magazine.

02:53.802 --> 02:55.602
We're gonna have to put
this baby to bed. - No.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.904
No, no, no, Sherman,
look, uh,

02:56.972 --> 02:58.439
I don't think
you understand, man.

02:58.506 --> 03:00.041
This car's been with me
through everything,

03:00.108 --> 03:02.108
so...
if you could just fix it.

03:02.176 --> 03:05.111
This is not really
officially a car anymore.

03:05.179 --> 03:07.280
You didn't even buy the
thing-- it was given to you

03:07.348 --> 03:08.381
as an illegal
recruitment gift from

03:08.449 --> 03:09.950
a college you
didn't even go to.

03:10.017 --> 03:11.484
- Things happened in this car.
- Like what?

03:11.552 --> 03:13.686
- Desert Storm?
- Oh, things happened.

03:14.454 --> 03:15.355
Is this your car?

03:15.923 --> 03:17.557
Yeah.

03:19.258 --> 03:20.092
Cool.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.094
Any time.

03:22.162 --> 03:23.795
It's time for you to
buy a new car, man.

03:23.863 --> 03:25.497
- You buy a new car!
- I bought a new car.

03:25.565 --> 03:27.799
It's what you borrow every
morning when this one

03:27.867 --> 03:29.435
makes the weird sound.

03:33.039 --> 03:34.605
- That's not a good sound.
- Just give me the keys.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.207
You shouldn't
call them keys.

03:36.275 --> 03:37.608
It's a paperclip
that you start the car with.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.914
<i>See, that was the noise
I was talking you about.</i>

03:43.983 --> 03:46.184
<i>Shut up.</i>

03:46.251 --> 03:47.918
You know you don't have
to sit like that.

03:48.487 --> 03:50.553
It's the only way
that it feels okay, Jess.

03:51.121 --> 03:52.189
- Jess!
- Sadie.

03:52.256 --> 03:54.591
Hey.
Hey. How are you?

03:54.658 --> 03:56.393
Good. How are you?
Hey, good to see you again, Nick.

03:56.461 --> 03:58.028
Hey. Hi.

03:58.096 --> 04:00.197
We were playing football,
and I tackled him.

04:00.264 --> 04:02.265
Oh. Well, that's not
exactly how I saw it.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.534
Oh, I'm surprised you got hurt.
You're such a big boy.

04:04.602 --> 04:05.935
Jess tackled a girl

04:06.003 --> 04:07.503
- I was dating once.
- Oh, yeah.

04:07.570 --> 04:09.038
She tried to steal
my overalls.

04:09.106 --> 04:10.973
Okay, so... does that hurt?

04:11.041 --> 04:12.341
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes!
- All right.

04:12.409 --> 04:13.642
Does that hurt?

04:13.710 --> 04:15.011
All right.
He can flip over.

04:15.078 --> 04:16.812
Okay.

04:19.348 --> 04:20.548
So... listen.

04:20.617 --> 04:23.985
This is not an
official examination,

04:24.053 --> 04:25.453
and I am not
officially telling you

04:25.521 --> 04:27.022
that you bruised your spine,

04:27.089 --> 04:28.323
and I am not officially

04:28.391 --> 04:29.790
giving you these pills

04:29.858 --> 04:31.826
- to manage the pain.
- Okay.

04:34.129 --> 04:35.128
So...

04:35.629 --> 04:36.897
please don't
take those pills.

04:36.964 --> 04:38.732
- Take the pills.
- Don't take those pills.

04:38.799 --> 04:39.767
Take the pills.

04:39.799 --> 04:40.767
Nobody prescribed them.

04:40.768 --> 04:42.036
- Take them. Take them.
- Why would you take them?

04:42.103 --> 04:43.837
- No. That's bad.
- That's a code. Take them.

04:43.838 --> 04:44.471
That means do it.

04:44.539 --> 04:46.540
Don't do that. No...

04:46.607 --> 04:48.375
Those are designed for
severe menstrual cramps,

04:48.943 --> 04:50.944
so they should cure
your baby back ache.

04:52.012 --> 04:53.379
"Baby backache."

04:53.581 --> 04:54.915
Wait. Stop.

04:56.082 --> 04:57.716
Hey, take another
sip of water.

05:03.524 --> 05:05.591
- Yeah, um...
- What? What's wrong?

05:05.659 --> 05:07.225
No, it's your thyroid.
I noticed something

05:07.226 --> 05:08.761
while you were swallowing.
Do you mind if I...?

05:08.828 --> 05:10.195
I mean, I don't know
what choice I have.

05:10.263 --> 05:12.264
- Do it, Nick!
- Okay, Jess. Stop.

05:12.331 --> 05:13.831
Yeah, he has a growth.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.368
Oh, my God.

05:16.436 --> 05:18.170
- A growth.
- Oh, no.

05:18.237 --> 05:19.938
- Everything works. I can swallow.
- Oh, my God.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.373
Everything's fine. I know
what you're talking about.

05:21.441 --> 05:23.375
- You knew about this?
- Yes.

05:23.443 --> 05:25.310
- So you've had it checked out?
- No, no, I don't...

05:25.378 --> 05:27.311
I don't have that stuff
checked out. I'm fine.

05:27.379 --> 05:28.645
I can set up an ultrasound
tomorrow morning,

05:28.713 --> 05:30.013
first thing--
I've got a friend.

05:30.082 --> 05:31.449
I can't really afford
an ultrasound, but...

05:31.996 --> 05:33.550
- You're going to have to, so...
- Yeah.

05:33.618 --> 05:35.386
All right.
So I'll set that up?

05:35.454 --> 05:37.254
- Absolutely.
- Right. Right.

05:37.322 --> 05:40.091
Make sure he goes, Jess.

05:40.158 --> 05:42.125
- Don't look at me like that, Jess.
- It's probably nothing.

05:42.193 --> 05:43.393
Yeah, it's nothing.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.728
Oh, God.

05:48.532 --> 05:50.266
Put the baby's head
at the bottom.

06:00.183 --> 06:01.817
I'm not going
to go tomorrow.

06:01.885 --> 06:03.319
I'd rather not,
because I don't want

06:03.387 --> 06:04.787
to get an ultrasound.

06:04.855 --> 06:06.322
I just don't have time.

06:06.390 --> 06:08.391
No, I've got some
writing I got to do.

06:08.459 --> 06:11.059
The truth is, with working out,
I've got some people to see,

06:11.127 --> 06:12.461
so I just can't make it.

06:12.528 --> 06:13.862
I lost a stamp.

06:14.429 --> 06:15.297
It sounds worse than it is,

06:15.365 --> 06:17.232
but it's a somewhat
expensive stamp

06:17.300 --> 06:19.000
and I had planned
on looking for it.

06:19.568 --> 06:21.169
One of the reasons I
moved to Los Angeles

06:21.237 --> 06:23.838
was to get closer to whales,
so I can record them.

06:23.906 --> 06:25.407
I haven't gotten
around to it

06:25.475 --> 06:27.074
because where we live
is actually east.

06:27.142 --> 06:28.542
It's way farther from the
ocean than I expected.

06:28.610 --> 06:29.910
I appreciate your concern.

06:29.978 --> 06:32.212
It is really sweet.
It's nice.

06:33.281 --> 06:34.848
But this machine's still
kicking, you know?

06:34.916 --> 06:36.083
You're going.

06:36.151 --> 06:37.551
And I know your scared,

06:37.619 --> 06:38.819
but you know what my mom

06:38.887 --> 06:40.154
used to do
when I got scared?

06:40.721 --> 06:41.989
A Daffy Duck impression.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.290
Please don't do what
you're about to do.

06:43.357 --> 06:45.792
Hey, Nicholas.

06:45.859 --> 06:47.794
I'm sorry you have
a lump in your throat.

06:47.861 --> 06:49.396
That's despicable!

06:51.765 --> 06:52.732
Sorry. Too much?

06:55.702 --> 06:56.235
Okay.

06:56.304 --> 06:58.570
- I got to go to work.
- I'll come with you.

06:58.638 --> 06:59.605
Oh, absolutely not.

06:59.673 --> 07:01.607
- I'll just sit by the bar.
- No way.

07:07.213 --> 07:10.047
You told them, Jess?
Really, it's not a big deal.

07:10.115 --> 07:11.416
- Don't tell them.
- We're just hanging out.

07:13.618 --> 07:14.652
With my best friend.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.487
Come on, Schmidt.
What are you do...?

07:18.791 --> 07:21.125
You just Fredo-kiss me?
What's your problem?

07:21.193 --> 07:22.427
Go sit down.

07:22.994 --> 07:23.794
You're going to
beat this, man.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.094
I don't have anything.

07:25.162 --> 07:26.930
What is going on
with you guys?

07:26.997 --> 07:27.964
Thanks for telling them.

07:31.902 --> 07:33.437
I take those, too--

07:33.504 --> 07:35.271
when I got a heavy flow.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.740
Good to know.

07:36.808 --> 07:38.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:39.576 --> 07:40.209
So I heard.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.910
Of course you did.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.912
Can I get a vodka soda?

07:44.480 --> 07:46.281
Thank you.
You being normal...

07:46.350 --> 07:48.116
- Vodka soda.
- Okay.

07:48.184 --> 07:50.419
It's because he refuses to wear a Bluetooth.
You know that.

07:50.487 --> 07:52.455
I gave him one
for his birthday, too,

07:52.522 --> 07:54.223
but he just laughed
in my face.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.990
Gave it back to
me for Hanukkah.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.692
Well, according
to this Web site,

07:57.760 --> 08:00.462
it could be a colloid nodule.

08:00.529 --> 08:03.431
But that's most common
in golden retrievers.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.166
I thought my lifestyle
choices would rub off on him.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.868
I tried to set
a good example.

08:06.935 --> 08:08.470
Treat your body like a temple.

08:08.537 --> 08:10.304
Treat your body
like a temple.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.172
But he treats his like a dump.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.374
Like a dump!

08:13.441 --> 08:15.442
Let me see this.

08:15.510 --> 08:16.844
Oh, my God.

08:16.911 --> 08:18.078
Hey, hey.

08:18.645 --> 08:19.413
My friends.

08:19.481 --> 08:20.714
Can I just say

08:20.782 --> 08:22.716
that these pills are amazing?

08:23.784 --> 08:25.519
I feel, like, really warm
in my uterus.

08:25.587 --> 08:27.053
Oh! I feel good.

08:27.121 --> 08:29.722
Feel real good.

08:29.790 --> 08:31.190
What's with the long faces?

08:31.758 --> 08:32.725
Schmidt?

08:32.793 --> 08:34.760
Just looking at you
and your beautiful soul.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.929
Big, strong Nick.

08:36.996 --> 08:38.530
- He's a champ.
- I wish I could trade

08:38.599 --> 08:40.032
places with you, 'cause
you know what, Nick?

08:40.100 --> 08:41.768
I would do it in a second.

08:43.102 --> 08:44.636
But I'm also glad
that I can't.

08:44.704 --> 08:47.171
Okay, what is going on
with you three?

08:47.239 --> 08:48.640
Oh, God. Jess?

08:49.108 --> 08:50.975
- Oh, God.
- Hey, are you okay?

08:51.043 --> 08:52.477
You're gonna freak him out.
You're gonna freak him out.

08:52.545 --> 08:54.112
- You're freaking everybody out.
- Why are you crying?

08:54.179 --> 08:56.047
- Schmidt, are you crying?
- 'Cause you're not helping.

08:56.115 --> 08:58.049
'Cause you're making me
cry with your emotion.

08:59.518 --> 09:01.485
Really, Winston? You?

09:01.553 --> 09:02.753
It's just that I love you
so much, man.

09:02.821 --> 09:04.354
Stop it. Enough.

09:04.423 --> 09:07.190
Hey, I'm fine. Just stop it.

09:07.258 --> 09:08.692
How do you know
you're fine, Nick?

09:13.097 --> 09:15.998
Is that... would that
be where... in my neck?

09:20.137 --> 09:21.170
Hmm.

09:23.441 --> 09:24.774
- I'm not going to lie.
- Mm-hmm.

09:24.842 --> 09:26.910
I think the pills are on top
of me a little bit.

09:27.477 --> 09:28.978
I think you're right.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.047
It's so sad.

09:31.114 --> 09:32.481
Yeah, it's really sad
your friend's getting

09:32.549 --> 09:33.949
an ultrasound tomorrow.

09:35.016 --> 09:36.552
It's just so hard.

09:40.022 --> 09:41.890
Are you using your
best friend's medical crisis

09:41.958 --> 09:43.659
to feel my boobs
with your face?

09:43.726 --> 09:45.060
Why isn't the whole world

09:45.127 --> 09:46.862
making love all
at the same time?

09:47.430 --> 09:48.963
How many...

09:49.030 --> 09:51.532
ears does Daniel Boone have?

09:52.100 --> 09:53.634
He's got a...
a right ear,

09:53.702 --> 09:56.337
a left ear and a...
front ear.

09:56.404 --> 09:57.538
"Frontier."
Get it?

09:59.575 --> 10:02.276
You don't get to speak
at my funeral.

10:03.344 --> 10:04.611
- What?
- For sure.

10:04.679 --> 10:07.146
- 100%.
- What? Why?

10:07.214 --> 10:09.649
- Because of that joke.
- Yeah, but...

10:09.717 --> 10:11.451
Jess, you don't want
to talk at a funeral.

10:11.519 --> 10:12.719
I've tried that once.

10:12.787 --> 10:14.721
What kind of dummy

10:14.789 --> 10:17.991
fixes a washing machine
using a knife?

10:18.058 --> 10:20.526
This kind of dummy!

10:20.594 --> 10:22.060
It did not go well.

10:22.128 --> 10:24.329
I don't want you
talking at my funeral!

10:24.797 --> 10:26.431
- Okay.
- You can go to my funeral,

10:26.500 --> 10:27.733
but you can't talk.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.902
My funeral
is my time to shine.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.837
I want the girls to think,

10:31.905 --> 10:33.572
"I wish I brought
Nick Miller to orgasm."

10:33.640 --> 10:35.173
And I want
the guys to think,

10:35.241 --> 10:36.774
"I wish I bought him
more stuff."

10:36.842 --> 10:38.275
And I don't want
Daffy Duck voices

10:38.343 --> 10:39.978
and feeling sticks.

10:40.045 --> 10:41.980
You don't...
you don't know how to be real.

10:43.749 --> 10:46.985
I can't have you
trying to cheer people up.

10:47.052 --> 10:48.887
I know how to be real.

10:53.557 --> 10:55.959
Question: Am I wearing a hat?

You don't do anything.

Mm.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.030

12:48.365 --> 12:49.633
you wanted to accomplish?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.501
Hey, I've done things.

12:51.568 --> 12:52.902
I wrote half a book

Okay, just tell me.

12:55.039 --> 12:56.940

12:57.008 --> 12:58.775
what would you do?

12:59.343 --> 13:02.077
You know, I'm the guy who...
I can't just

13:02.145 --> 13:04.212
jump into something if I don't
know what's gonna happen.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.614
I never have been that guy.

13:06.682 --> 13:07.382
Like, I'm the,

13:07.450 --> 13:09.618
I'm the guy that,
if I don't know

13:09.686 --> 13:11.120
what's gonna happen,
I don't do something.

13:11.187 --> 13:13.421
Ever. I don't care
how bad I want to do it.

13:13.489 --> 13:14.957
I don't do it.

13:15.025 --> 13:16.891
Like, if everybody
would go into the ocean

13:16.959 --> 13:18.260
and jumped in the water,

13:19.327 --> 13:21.228
well, I'm the guy on the beach
guarding the wallets.

13:24.098 --> 13:25.700
All right.

13:29.705 --> 13:30.872
- All right, Nick.
- All right.

13:30.939 --> 13:32.438
- Get out there.
- Yeah.

13:32.506 --> 13:34.107
- I'll hold your wallet.
- I don't have a wallet.

13:34.175 --> 13:35.909
All right,
well, that's fine.

13:35.977 --> 13:38.045
I have a sandwich bag with
my license and money in it.

13:38.112 --> 13:39.479
Okay, I'll hold
your sandwich bag.

13:39.547 --> 13:40.847
Get out there, go.

13:40.915 --> 13:43.283
It's a little cold.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.152
Just in terms of
running into the water,

13:45.219 --> 13:46.920
it's a tad on the cold side.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.228
Well, you know what,

13:56.296 --> 13:59.364
just... it's just...

14:06.906 --> 14:08.006
We all taking our shoes off?

14:08.074 --> 14:09.007
What's going on?

14:09.075 --> 14:10.441
I'm a little drunk,

14:10.509 --> 14:12.677
and I can't be too sure,
but I think

14:12.745 --> 14:14.746
you're finally about to see
your best friend's penis.

14:15.915 --> 14:17.648
Nick-- he's gonna sh--

14:17.717 --> 14:19.283
he's gonna show his penis
to the ocean and not me?

14:19.351 --> 14:20.617
Nick, wait!

14:26.635 --> 14:28.970
I'm alive!

14:29.038 --> 14:30.872
I... am... alive!

14:36.411 --> 14:38.146
I'm alive!

14:44.552 --> 14:47.320
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:47.388 --> 14:49.155
This is stupid!

14:49.723 --> 14:51.190
No, it's cold!

14:51.258 --> 14:54.326
My testicles are
in my abdomen!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
What was I thinking??

14:56.930 --> 14:58.464
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:58.632 --> 15:00.265
Oh, my God!
That is so cold!

15:00.266 --> 15:01.007
That is so cold!

15:01.008 --> 15:02.835
Words cannot describe
how cold that is!

15:02.903 --> 15:03.903
Nick, are you okay?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.372
No, I'm not okay, Jess!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.039
I'm not okay!

15:08.107 --> 15:09.375
All right, I woke up today

15:09.442 --> 15:12.044
and I wanted to play a friendly
game of touch football,

15:12.112 --> 15:15.013
then I hurt my back, and I
went to your gynecologist,

15:15.081 --> 15:16.714
and now I might have cancer!

15:16.783 --> 15:18.416
So, no, Jess!

15:18.484 --> 15:20.952
I'm not okay!

15:28.126 --> 15:29.394
I don't think
this is the right time

15:29.461 --> 15:32.997
to bring this up,
you guys, but...

15:33.064 --> 15:35.199
does anyone else think
Nick could stand to lose

15:35.267 --> 15:36.366
five to seven pounds?

15:53.016 --> 15:55.384
You know what
I'm thinking about, Ceec?

15:55.452 --> 15:57.254
What, Schmidt?

15:58.322 --> 16:00.990
That when you stand up,

16:02.058 --> 16:04.526
there's gonna be, like,
a perfect imprint

16:04.593 --> 16:05.794
of your butt in the sand.

16:06.362 --> 16:07.895
That is what you're
thinking about right now

16:07.963 --> 16:09.831
- with your best friend
- down the beach

16:09.898 --> 16:11.266
- going through what he's going through?
- I know, I know.

16:11.584 --> 16:12.917
Then why would you say that?

16:12.985 --> 16:14.019
I don't know why
I would say that.

16:14.087 --> 16:15.753
Why would anyone say that?

16:15.821 --> 16:18.155
I've never gone through
anything like this.

16:18.223 --> 16:19.656
Yeah, well, I have.

16:20.424 --> 16:22.025
What happened?

16:22.094 --> 16:24.228
My dad died when I was 12.

16:25.997 --> 16:27.664
That's, um...

16:27.732 --> 16:30.334
The only way to get through it
is to get through it.

16:36.039 --> 16:37.607
You know, I had
a cat that died...

16:37.674 --> 16:39.142
Don't compare my
dad to your cat.

16:39.210 --> 16:40.543
It was a big cat.

16:40.611 --> 16:41.944
I mean, human size.

16:45.115 --> 16:46.983
Hey.

16:47.050 --> 16:48.351
Oh, hey.

16:48.419 --> 16:50.052
Is this seat taken?

16:50.120 --> 16:51.886
Oh, please.

16:52.454 --> 16:54.223
Here, will you help me up?

16:59.461 --> 17:01.062
I know that you're right.

17:01.131 --> 17:03.332
You're right,
I have to start doing things.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.267
I can't just...

17:07.435 --> 17:08.502
...you know.

17:10.472 --> 17:11.907
Jess...

17:13.271 --> 17:14.907
I like you a lot.

17:15.276 --> 17:16.277
I really do.

17:16.345 --> 17:17.678
I'm glad you're around.

17:23.951 --> 17:26.919
I'm not gonna remember any
of this in the morning, am I?

17:26.987 --> 17:28.921
Most certainly not.

17:28.989 --> 17:29.956
Oh, no.

17:31.025 --> 17:33.160
Yeah, it's... yeah.

17:34.962 --> 17:36.563
Yeah, we should go home.

17:36.631 --> 17:37.964
Yes.

17:38.032 --> 17:39.898
Let's go home.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.946
Hey. We gotta wake up.

17:56.014 --> 17:57.114
Morning.

17:57.183 --> 17:58.449
What?

17:59.517 --> 18:01.018
Hey, Schmidty!

18:02.588 --> 18:03.888
Wake up, wake up!
Everybody, up!

18:03.955 --> 18:05.190
I got that ultrasound thing.

18:05.257 --> 18:07.091
We're late.

18:12.730 --> 18:14.565
What?

18:21.105 --> 18:22.372
Oh...

18:32.815 --> 18:33.849
Hey, Winston.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.251
We're late, man.

18:37.319 --> 18:38.354
Ah, fresh air.

18:38.355 --> 18:39.501
Back to the fume chamber.

18:39.504 --> 18:40.824
Couldn't even
sell it for metal.

18:42.391 --> 18:43.858
Hope you didn't
get sand in my car.

18:43.926 --> 18:46.795
Yeah, that's this
car's problem: too much sand.

18:47.863 --> 18:49.531
Oh, my God, there's soot
coming in from the floor.

18:57.692 --> 18:59.793
Hi. Uh, my name
is Nick Miller.

18:59.860 --> 19:01.995
I-I have a 9:00 a.m. today.

19:02.063 --> 19:04.030
Fill these out.
I'm gonna need a copy

19:04.099 --> 19:05.932
- of your health insurance.
- Oh.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.569
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
paying with cash, actually.

19:08.636 --> 19:11.705
It's a mixture of, uh,
paper money and change.

19:12.272 --> 19:13.772
I do have a check
that's postdated.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.509
There's a 60/40 shot
that's gonna clear.

19:17.777 --> 19:18.944
I hope that's good.

19:21.982 --> 19:23.316
Jess-- oh, yeah.

19:24.383 --> 19:25.451
Do I have to do this now?

19:33.125 --> 19:36.128
How long does it take to
tell if someone has cancer?

19:39.132 --> 19:40.865
- Guys.
- Hey.

19:41.433 --> 19:42.967
I'm okay. I'm fine.

19:43.035 --> 19:43.868
I'm fine.
It's nothing.

19:43.936 --> 19:45.103
Yeah.

19:45.170 --> 19:47.304
What was it?
What did they say it was?

19:47.372 --> 19:48.640
I didn't hear anything
after they said,

19:48.707 --> 19:51.008
"You don't have cancer."
I blanked out. I think it's,

19:51.075 --> 19:53.410
like, a cyst or something.

19:53.478 --> 19:54.945
Ugh.

19:55.013 --> 19:56.247
Stop Fredo-kissing
me, Schmidt.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.991
All right,
so what do I owe you?

20:00.992 --> 20:01.684
Let's figure this out.

20:02.252 --> 20:02.818
I've got, uh...

20:02.886 --> 20:04.521
It's already taken care of.

20:04.588 --> 20:07.056
What do you mean
it's already taken care of?

20:07.124 --> 20:08.625
Oh, we split it.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.230
All right, well,
I'll pay you guys back.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.632
I just...

20:15.699 --> 20:17.099
And can you please
get a wallet?

20:17.167 --> 20:18.200
I do have a wallet.

20:19.268 --> 20:20.602
A wallet.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.305
I have tons of wallet chains
that you can borrow.

What happened last night?

20:38.387 --> 20:39.920
Nothing.

20:43.391 --> 20:45.958
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.262
- Let it go, bud.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:49.330 --> 20:50.797
- Just got to give it a second.
- Bye.

20:50.864 --> 20:51.998
It's cruel
