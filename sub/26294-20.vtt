WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.441
I've loved spending time
with you, Sylvie.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.312
But I am here to counsel
rescue workers.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.749
If I'm dating a colleague,
they won't open up to me.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.153
Is that what happened
with Casey?

00:12.186 --> 00:13.361
I can't see you anymore.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.624
We need you here, and...

00:15.667 --> 00:17.452
I don't want to
get in the way of that.

00:17.495 --> 00:18.844
Where you been, Severide?

00:18.888 --> 00:20.542
We haven't seen you
at Molly's lately.

00:20.585 --> 00:21.630
Just been slammed.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.371
Kelly's my blind spot.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.373
When it comes to him,

00:25.416 --> 00:28.506
I sort of just go off the rails.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.658
Einstein had, like, six
versions of the same clothes,

00:30.682 --> 00:31.790
'cause he didn't want
to have to think

00:31.814 --> 00:33.424
about that kind of thing.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.687
So are you calling yourself
a genius then?

00:35.731 --> 00:37.211
What's this?

00:37.254 --> 00:38.690
Thought I'd brighten
up the place.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.171
Spring is here, you guys.
Summer's on its way.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.694
These are so pretty!

00:42.738 --> 00:44.194
A little early in the morning
for perkiness,

00:44.218 --> 00:46.698
don't you think?

00:46.742 --> 00:49.571
You need to get them
out of hereallergies.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.616
Yeah, hydrangeas
don't have pollen.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.357
I think you might be
getting a cold.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.446
I do not have a cold.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.669
Hey, Lieutenant?
I parked next to your car

01:00.712 --> 01:02.192
this morning,
saw all those boxes.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.735
Are you moving?
No, Benny's house sold.

01:03.759 --> 01:07.328
Had to clear the place out.
Um... well...

01:07.371 --> 01:11.114
I happened to notice a classic
George Foreman Grill in there.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.464
All yours.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.118
Thanks, Boss!

01:15.162 --> 01:17.207
Yeah.

01:19.166 --> 01:23.300
That must not have been fun,
clearing out Benny's house.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.128
It wasn't too bad.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.478
The place I haven't touched
yet is his cabin up north.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.803
I'm heading there
after next shift.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.481
I remember you talking about it.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.135
You spent a lot
of time there, right?

01:32.179 --> 01:35.747
Some.
Probably gonna sell that, too.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.534
That's got to be messing
with his head.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.232
Anything related to Benny does,
let alone...

01:42.276 --> 01:44.582
going through his belongings.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.648
I don't have to get rid
of the flowers

01:47.672 --> 01:49.718
because of Mouch, right?
Hell no.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.634
No way.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.679
You think first shift
will ever get

01:54.723 --> 01:55.767
their inventory straight?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.421
Yeah, that'll be a first.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.294
Hey, Franz is here.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.948
I love this guy. Heart of gold.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.472
Yeah? Well, I don't know him.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.430
Hey Franzy. To what do we owe

02:06.474 --> 02:08.170
this pleasure?
Nice try, Herrmann.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.608
- Let's have it.
- Have what?

02:10.651 --> 02:12.915
The piercing nozzle you guys
borrowed off our rig

02:12.958 --> 02:14.873
at that attic fire
in East Garfield.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.441
What are you talking about?
We returned that on the scene.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.401
Like hell you did.
Come on, cough it up.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.403
What do you think we are?

02:22.446 --> 02:24.666
A bunch of kleptos?
If it walks like a duck...

02:24.709 --> 02:26.972
Whoa, that's uncalled for.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.236
That piercing nozzle
belongs to 27!

02:29.279 --> 02:30.933
Klinginpill, what do you care?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.456
You don't belong to 27.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.285
Yeah, mind your own business,
floater.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.592
Hey, I got to back up
Herrmann on this, lieutenant.

02:37.635 --> 02:38.854
We returned that nozzle

02:38.897 --> 02:40.297
as soon as we were finished
with it.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.944
All right, you guys
had your chance

02:41.987 --> 02:44.207
to come clean and now
you can explain yourself

02:44.251 --> 02:46.427
to my battalion chief. Bring it.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.473
Engine 51...

02:49.517 --> 02:51.736
Getting that nozzle back one
way or another.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.347
Get your heap out of my way.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.262
Battalion 25. Structure fire...

02:55.305 --> 02:57.220
I hate that guy.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.033 --> 03:30.253
Fire's in the salon
on the first floor.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.733
Let's make sure
it doesn't spread.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.319
Residents coming down
the fire escape.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.258
- Okay, truck, primary search.
- Copy.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.670
Engine, lead out a line
into that salon.

03:36.694 --> 03:37.956
Copy.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.697
Squad,
get those people down safely.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.351
- You got it, Chief.
- Tony, Capp,

03:41.395 --> 03:42.918
help people down
the ladder drop.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.268
Cruz, we're going up. Copy that.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.531
Kidd, Otis.
Clear the units above.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.577
Mouch, you're with me.
Hose line will be ready

03:49.620 --> 03:51.927
in a minute, Captain.
We'll make this quick.

03:57.324 --> 04:00.065
Fire department! Call out!

04:07.116 --> 04:08.987
All right, keep moving,
everybody.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.381
One step at a time. Be careful.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.648
Okay, ma'am. Nice and easy.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.608
Come on.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.394
Cruz.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.530
Fire Department! Call out!

04:29.573 --> 04:31.575
Fire Department! Call out!

04:38.626 --> 04:39.975
Fire is spreading fast!

04:44.066 --> 04:45.937
Hey, ma'am?

04:45.981 --> 04:47.480
My name's Kelly.
We're gonna get you down

04:47.504 --> 04:50.115
from here, okay?
Just try not to move.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.813
Hey, guys,
I need a half-sked up here,

04:51.856 --> 04:53.815
and rig a basket to the aerial.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.643
Coming right up.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.993
Back room's all clear.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.695
Captain!

05:04.739 --> 05:08.656
Those are about to pop!

05:08.699 --> 05:11.093
Let's go!

05:36.640 --> 05:38.555
All clear, Chief.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.949
- Do your thing, Herrmann.
- All right.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.343
- Let's go, Ritter.
- Copy.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.588
We're going to lower
you down to our medics.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.265
They're going
to take good care of you.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.616
Here we go.
All right, let's bring her up!

06:02.144 --> 06:04.625
Bring her down!

06:12.328 --> 06:15.984
Careful...

06:23.034 --> 06:25.385
She took a nasty fall.
Possible neck injury.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.649
Let's check her vitals
on the rig.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.694
Got it.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.393
My God! Is Miriam all right?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.786
- Are you family?
- No, I-I own the salon.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.136
She'sshe's a customer
and friend.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.661
What happened? Is everyone okay?

06:41.662 --> 06:43.228
Wh...

06:43.272 --> 06:44.597
Where's Miles?
Is there someone inside?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.120
Is there someone inside?
I don't know!

06:46.144 --> 06:48.320
My dog, he's a Shepherd mix.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.626
He watches the place at night.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.193
Where's Miles?

06:51.236 --> 06:53.325
Miles!
Ma'am, you can't go in there!

06:53.369 --> 06:54.477
- Hey, come here.
- My whole life

06:54.501 --> 06:56.459
is in that salon. I can't...

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
This can't be happening.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.463
This can't be happening.
Ma'am...

07:00.507 --> 07:01.812
- Ma'am...
- No!

07:01.856 --> 07:04.511
- I'm sorry.
- Miles!

07:04.554 --> 07:07.731
I'm sorry.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.449
The flowers are still here.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.189
You sneezed on the truck, too.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.582
And in the bunk room.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.497
- Yup.
- Maybe it's a cold.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.282
- I don't have a cold!
- Can somebody please explain

07:37.326 --> 07:42.070
why I just got a $1,000 invoice
for a piercing nozzle?

07:46.378 --> 07:48.859
Chief, I'm telling you,
we had the piercing nozzle

07:48.903 --> 07:50.620
for five minutes, tops.
And wasn't one of Franz's

07:50.644 --> 07:52.123
guys with us the whole time?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.560
Yeah, he took it back the minute

07:53.603 --> 07:54.885
we were done with it.
Plus, we've cleaned out

07:54.909 --> 07:56.563
our rigs twice since that shift.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.608
If the nozzle ended up
in one of our compartments

07:58.652 --> 08:01.263
we'd have found it.
We're not thieves, Chief.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.092
Franz called us
a bunch of kleptos.

08:04.135 --> 08:08.226
Chief Boden calling
for Chief Lydon.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.750
Afternoon, Steve.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.535
I received your invoice
for the piercing nozzle,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.363
and I am filing it away

08:14.406 --> 08:17.409
in the appropriate location.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.282
Now, I don't know what Franz
and his crew were up to...

08:20.325 --> 08:23.546
Whether they lost the nozzle
somewhere or they're just

08:23.590 --> 08:27.550
trying to stir up trouble...
But I don't appreciate anyone

08:27.594 --> 08:29.726
impugning the integrity of 51.

08:29.770 --> 08:33.164
And the next time
you have an issue

08:33.207 --> 08:36.777
with my house,
instead of sending me a fax,

08:36.820 --> 08:39.736
pick up the phone.
Talk to me man to man.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.397
Get out of my office. Yes, sir.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.574
Copy that.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.882
Thanks, Chief.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.538
You used to spend all day
at the salon?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.757
At least four to five hours
minimum.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.455
But my hair was always laid
thanks to the magic

09:03.499 --> 09:05.762
of chemical relaxers.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.765
Growing up,
it was like a rite of passage.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.854
Then I grew out of it
once I found out that stuff

09:10.898 --> 09:13.683
could chew through Coke cans.
No bueno.

09:13.727 --> 09:17.295
Hey, Kyle. How's it going?

09:18.949 --> 09:21.169
Not bad. How are you, Em?

09:21.212 --> 09:24.259
I'm great, thanks.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.958
We're running low
on gloves, so we need those.

09:28.002 --> 09:31.658
I'm gonna go get them.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.878
- Hey, how you been?
- Good.

09:34.922 --> 09:38.534
Really good.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.797
I haven't seen you
around the firehouse lately.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.669
Yeah, I know.
Things have been busy,

09:42.712 --> 09:45.454
but I'll swing by soon.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.329
You'll never guess what I found
myself watching the other day.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.331
"Pet Sematary"?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.333
"Property Brothers."

09:55.377 --> 09:57.335
No way.
Yeah, it was the one where

09:57.379 --> 09:59.990
they turned an old barn
into a sleek modern townhouse,

10:00.034 --> 10:02.340
but they still had
their pet pigs.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.647
Yeah,
that's my favorite episode.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.649
Excuse me, Chaplain Sheffield?

10:06.693 --> 10:09.260
You have a visitor waiting
in your office.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.306
- Sorry, I got to...
- Yeah, no, go ahead.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.309
Okay, well...

10:16.920 --> 10:19.749
It was nice to see you, Sylvie.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.665
You, too.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.547
You wanted to see us, Chief?

10:35.591 --> 10:37.680
Yes, Captain Hubble
wants to get your statements

10:37.724 --> 10:39.421
on the salon fire.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.511
- Yeah, sure thing.
- The ashes are still warm.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.252
What's got OFI moving
so quick on this?

10:44.295 --> 10:45.708
Well, we found plenty
of indication on the scene

10:45.732 --> 10:48.430
to call this one an arson.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.911
Damn.

10:50.954 --> 10:54.610
That's too bad.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.394
The salon owner's a sweet lady.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.850
She was pretty devastated
by what happened.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.050
- I feel for her.
- I wouldn't.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.010
Looks like
she's the one who did it.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.321
- I'm not buying it.
- Flammable hair products

11:10.365 --> 11:11.385
were dumped all over
the back office.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.933
File cabinets left opened

11:12.976 --> 11:14.171
so the documents inside
would burn...

11:14.195 --> 11:15.476
I'm not saying this isn't arson,

11:15.500 --> 11:16.806
but she didn't set the fire.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.460
- No way.
- How do you know?

11:18.503 --> 11:20.307
You should have seen
her reaction at the scene.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.464
She was crushed.
The victim is a friend of hers.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.118
Well, she may not have intended

11:24.161 --> 11:25.530
for anyone to get hurt.
We see this all the time

11:25.554 --> 11:27.425
with insurance scammers.
They underestimate

11:27.469 --> 11:29.340
how much damage or injury
a fire can cause.

11:29.384 --> 11:32.169
You think this was
an insurance situation?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.060
Several neighbors
said the salon was under water

11:34.084 --> 11:35.975
and the owner was very upset
about the possibility

11:35.999 --> 11:38.610
of losing her business.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.961
Her dog was inside.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.528
Not a chance she left
her dog in there to die.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.139
We didn't find any dog.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.420
Okay, well, maybe
he got out somehow.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.143
Or maybe it was never there.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.014
I've seen a lot of people
watch their home

11:51.058 --> 11:52.146
or their business burn.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.147
She isn't faking it.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.844
That much I can tell you.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.411
Have you questioned the owner?

11:56.454 --> 11:58.334
She's at Chicago Med
visiting with the victim.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.607
I'm heading over there
right now to talk to her.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.896
I'll come with you.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.332
- You're on shift.
- Chicago Med.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.986
I'll be back in an hour.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.075
Okay, who are you
trying to help, me or her?

12:08.118 --> 12:10.033
I can aid your investigation,
Captain.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.339
I connected with her.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.995
She'll open up more
if I'm there with you.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.911
He has a point.

12:21.262 --> 12:24.308
One hour.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.686
Never let it be said
that Benny Severide

12:34.710 --> 12:36.146
wasn't the real deal.

12:36.190 --> 12:39.323
This is a full on
OG George Foreman Grill.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.498
That's like strutting around

12:40.542 --> 12:42.587
with first generation
Air Jordans.

12:42.631 --> 12:45.982
Isn't it basically
just a steamer?

12:46.026 --> 12:47.897
No! Next shift,

12:47.941 --> 12:49.440
I'm going to grill
up some Cuban Reubens

12:49.464 --> 12:50.963
and I'm gonna make a convert
out of you.

12:50.987 --> 12:54.730
- Okay.
- My God!

12:54.774 --> 12:57.211
What?

13:02.259 --> 13:04.479
- Here they are.
- All right.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.699
Why all the secrecy?

13:07.743 --> 13:10.311
Show 'em, Joe.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.363
Where the hell
did that come from?

13:19.407 --> 13:21.409
It was just leaning
behind a storage crate.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.561
Guess it must have wound up
on one of the rigs after all.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.326
One of the other shifts
must have found it

13:25.369 --> 13:27.197
and set it aside.
If Boden finds out

13:27.241 --> 13:29.591
about this after the way
he stuck it to Chief Lydon...

13:29.634 --> 13:31.288
He is not going
to find out about it,

13:31.332 --> 13:33.421
because we're going to get it
back to Engine 27

13:33.464 --> 13:35.945
without anybody knowing.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.642
A caper. Exciting.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.080
It is not a caper.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.386
All we have to do is sneak
into their house,

13:42.430 --> 13:44.780
return the nozzle,
and then just sneak back out

13:44.824 --> 13:47.348
undetected.
Yeah, that's a caper.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.958
You call it whatever you want,

13:49.002 --> 13:52.266
but we are doing this
first thing after shift.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.488
I am really good
at this stuff, Herrmann.

13:57.532 --> 14:00.535
Once, in high school,
my friends and I stole

14:00.578 --> 14:04.104
a human skeleton from the bio
lab and we propped it up

14:04.147 --> 14:06.628
behind the wheel
of Mr. Gazaway's minivan...

14:13.330 --> 14:14.636
When you get out of surgery,

14:14.679 --> 14:16.079
I'll be outside
in the waiting room.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.508
I'm not going anywhere, Miriam.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.510
I'll be right here.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.300
Let's get her prepped
for intake.

14:28.519 --> 14:31.087
Ms. Curtis,
I'm Captain Alexa Hubble

14:31.131 --> 14:32.499
with the Office
of Fire Investigation.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.482
I believe you've already met
Lieutenant Severide.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.440
Yes, hi. Thank you so much

14:36.484 --> 14:38.834
for what you did for Miriam.
And for me.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.662
How is she doing?

14:40.705 --> 14:42.664
I guess it's
a pretty serious spinal injury

14:42.707 --> 14:44.318
that the doctors
need to get in there

14:44.361 --> 14:46.624
and see what they can do.
I'm just praying for her.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.508
It's nice of you
to look after her like this.

14:48.539 --> 14:49.690
She doesn't have anyone else.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.760
Her husband died last year.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.027
Was there any sign
of Miles in the salon?

14:58.071 --> 15:00.508
My dog?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.640
- No.
- Well, that's a good thing,

15:02.684 --> 15:04.816
right? Maybe he got out.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.664
I need to ask you a few
questions about the fire.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.517
Is that okay?

15:09.560 --> 15:12.259
Yeah, sure.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.304
Where were you
when the fire started?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.176
I don't know
when the fire started.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.178
I came in early to take Miles
for his walk

15:18.221 --> 15:19.875
and my salon was in flames.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.313
When I checked
my security cameras,

15:23.357 --> 15:24.706
Miles was in there.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.664
He was sleeping by the door.

15:26.708 --> 15:30.799
I was trying to find out
how the fire started butsee?

15:30.842 --> 15:33.584
The camera stopped working...
I guess because of the fire.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.630
- I don't know.
- It had cut out

15:35.673 --> 15:38.154
at least a half an hour before
the fire started.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.200
How often do your cameras
shut down like this?

15:40.243 --> 15:42.376
They're just wi-fi cameras.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.291
You know how that stuff
goes in and out.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.597
It's a little strange,
though, isn't it?

15:46.641 --> 15:48.860
The timing?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.867
You think I burned down
my salon?

15:55.911 --> 15:58.087
It is too soon to make
a determination,

15:58.131 --> 15:59.238
but we are
looking for the truth.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.785
Well, here's the truth.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.570
I loved that salon.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.660
It wasn't ever going to make me
rich, but it was my dream.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.837
My own place where my clients
could come and...

16:08.880 --> 16:12.145
And hang out, and feel like
they were at home with family.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.624
Miriam is family.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.539
I would never put her
in danger like that.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.498
Niya, no one's accusing you
of anything.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.673
She is!

16:18.716 --> 16:20.240
We're just looking for answers,

16:20.283 --> 16:22.111
and this is helpful,
what you're telling us.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.461
You're not going to get
railroaded here, I promise you.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.637
You have to find
whoever did this.

16:26.681 --> 16:30.815
We're gonna try like hell.
That's a guarantee.

16:32.774 --> 16:36.256
Can youcan we get a copy
of that whole video?

16:36.299 --> 16:39.476
Of course, yes.
I-I can send you the link.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.670
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:59.714 --> 17:03.326
Everything all right?
Yeah, totally.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.461
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's...

17:07.503 --> 17:10.246
It's not a big deal.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.336
I saw Kyle at Med.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.208
And he gave you flowers?

17:15.251 --> 17:18.428
No.
I got these for the common room

17:18.472 --> 17:20.778
but Mouch keeps complaining
about his allergies

17:20.821 --> 17:24.173
so I was going to stash them
under his bed.

17:28.917 --> 17:32.660
It was weird seeing Kyle.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.705
But it was also nice...

17:34.749 --> 17:37.665
Which is hard, you know?

17:37.708 --> 17:40.668
Yeah, I do.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.366
It's strange he hasn't
been around here, right?

17:43.410 --> 17:46.630
He used to come by once a week.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.806
Has to be
because of the break up.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.507
Could be.

17:56.379 --> 18:00.209
I feel responsible for all that.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.776
I'm sorry, Brett.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.699
If I hadn't been spinning out
after that call...

18:03.734 --> 18:05.277
If it hadn't been you,
it would've been

18:05.301 --> 18:08.739
someone else here.
It's not your fault, Casey.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.654
Truth is, the relationship
was a bad idea

18:10.698 --> 18:13.004
from the start...

18:13.048 --> 18:17.270
Seemed like you two
had a good thing going.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.968
We did.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.317
But...

18:21.361 --> 18:25.234
it's time
for me to move on and...

18:25.278 --> 18:29.064
It's just taking me longer
than I thought it would.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.761
Tell me about it.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.894
I still can't walk past
Gabby's locker.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.555
Ambulance 61, person injured,

18:41.598 --> 18:43.252
- 552 Webster Avenue...
- Here.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.298
You can put these
in your office instead.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.272
Hey, I know this place.
I take spin classes here.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.580
Olivia!

19:06.623 --> 19:07.755
My God, Sylvia,

19:07.798 --> 19:09.452
I didn't know
you were a paramedic.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.976
Come on, you guys.
You have to help this girl.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.764
She fell off her bike. It's bad.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.722
Okay, guys. Give us some space.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.071
Come on. Clear out, please.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.334
Look out, look out, look out.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.552
Let us get in there, guys.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.033
Come on.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.351
I don't know what happened.
One minute I'm spinning

19:38.394 --> 19:40.285
and the next thing I know,
this chick next to me goes

19:40.309 --> 19:41.721
flying forward off her bike,
and there's blood everywhere.

19:41.745 --> 19:42.983
We got it, all right?
Just step back.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.052
Honey, can you hear me?

19:44.095 --> 19:45.358
- What's your name?
- Claire.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.683
Claire?
Okay, we're gonna get you out

19:46.707 --> 19:49.013
in just a second, okay?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.730
All right, looks like we're
gonna to have to cut her hair.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.192
Let's wipe up some of this
blood so I can get a good look.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.238
Can you give me some towels?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.066
Hello?

19:58.109 --> 20:00.242
I-I got it.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.941
Excuse me.

20:03.985 --> 20:07.249
Coming through. Here you go.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.992
Thank you, thanks.

20:11.035 --> 20:14.125
Hold her steady.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.957
Almost there.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.091
All right, she's clear.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.441
Gonna have you lean up
for me, okay?

20:25.485 --> 20:28.139
Good.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.358
You can hold on to me.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.622
Keep your chin up for me,
sweetie.

20:32.666 --> 20:36.409
Here we go.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.280
- You good to go?
- Yup.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.282
Okay, just like that.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.373
Excuse me.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.070
Thank you.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.290
I'm gonna have you stand up
for me, okay?

20:48.334 --> 20:51.032
Good, good. Good.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.165
All right, let me just get you
in there, okay?

20:54.209 --> 20:57.299
You're doing just fine. Okay.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.735
All right, Brett. On three.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.347
Onetwothree.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.310
Is she gonna be okay?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.573
Um, yeah. Her vitals are stable.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.096
Poor girl.

21:12.140 --> 21:15.361
The way you handled it...
Total badass.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.319
Well,
thanks for the towel assist.

21:17.363 --> 21:20.322
Sorry about Jason. What a wuss.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
Where are all the real men
in Chicago, you know?

21:22.324 --> 21:25.371
Not in spin class, I guess.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.471
Red One, what do you see?

21:41.212 --> 21:43.737
- All clear.
- Hey, Otis.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.305
- Red Two.
- Right.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.437
- Yes.
- What do you got?

21:48.481 --> 21:51.266
Red Two is in position.
Are we a go?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.051
Repeat, are we a go?

21:54.095 --> 21:57.098
Yes, you are a go.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.451
- Wait!
- Whoa!

22:02.495 --> 22:06.063
- Hold up, hold up.
- Shh...

22:09.632 --> 22:12.809
- Go.
- Okay, you are clear.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.769
Go, get it done.

22:15.812 --> 22:19.338
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.383
Nice.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
Hey, where do you think
they keep it?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.623
Who cares?
Just pick a compartment

22:24.647 --> 22:26.388
and dump the thing.
How's this one?

22:26.432 --> 22:29.173
It literally doesn't matter.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.620
Go, go, go!

22:42.448 --> 22:44.711
- Mouch, don't!
- Achoo!

22:44.754 --> 22:47.104
Gesundheit!

22:49.803 --> 22:51.500
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

22:51.544 --> 22:52.893
I told you it was a cold.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.634
- You had it all along.
- Klinginpill,

22:54.677 --> 22:56.375
this does not concern you.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.725
If you breathe a word
of this to anyone...

22:58.768 --> 23:01.467
What's it worth to you?

23:03.643 --> 23:06.689
Red One, report.

23:06.733 --> 23:10.258
Red Two, what's your situation?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.438
All right, this operation
went sneakers up.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.937
Pull the ripcord.
Don't got to tell me twice.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.355
Let's go.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.365
- So, I was thinking...
- Hi.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.194
We should totally be dating.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.457
No. No, sorry.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.460
What I mean is, we are more
than capable of moving on.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.723
We just need to be more
proactive about finding dates.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.595
- Okay.
- So there's this woman

23:42.638 --> 23:43.857
who teaches my spin class

23:43.900 --> 23:46.468
whom I think
would be perfect for you.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.557
A blind date?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.187
No, we could make it, like,
a group thing.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.884
I'll set up a little game
night at my place.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.389
That way you get to know her,
see what you think about her.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.956
No pressure.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.480
You'd do that, right?

24:00.351 --> 24:02.876
Kelly must still be
at that arson scene.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.313
He is really throwing himself
into this investigation.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.725
It's all he talked about
on shift.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.795
Because it's
the perfect distraction

24:08.838 --> 24:11.493
so that he doesn't have
to go through Benny's stuff.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.322
Yeah.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.629
Honestly, I'm worried about him.

24:16.672 --> 24:20.284
Do you think it would be dumb
if I were to reach out

24:20.328 --> 24:23.679
and let him know that I'm here
to talk, just as a friend?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.657
You know I'll support you
no matter what, but every time

24:25.681 --> 24:27.509
you have tried the friend route
with Severide,

24:27.553 --> 24:29.380
it has gone south.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.905
Well,
maybe third time's a charm?

24:31.948 --> 24:35.822
So much for,
"Leave no man behind."

24:35.865 --> 24:37.301
Caper didn't go so well?

24:37.345 --> 24:39.826
I don't want to talk about it.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.712
There was another one.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.714
You were right.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.686
These cameras
are still connected.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.688
Niya could have disabled it
from her phone,

25:15.731 --> 25:18.778
though it'll probably
take a subpoena to find out.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.693
I don't know why
you have it in for her.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.390
I'm just going off
of the evidence.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.802
Why are you
taking her at face value?

25:23.826 --> 25:26.481
Because I trust my gut.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.398
- Who do I sue?
- Hey, you can't be in here.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.878
This is an active investigation.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.010
That's okay,
I just want to know who to sue,

25:34.054 --> 25:36.056
the power company
or the landlord?

25:36.099 --> 25:37.405
What are you talking about?

25:37.448 --> 25:38.537
I live upstairs.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.756
Got smoke damage everywhere.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.671
I mean, I know this
was an electrical fire.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.586
I just don't know
whose fault it is.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.588
What makes you think
it was an electrical fire?

25:46.632 --> 25:49.635
Well, there was that outage
before the fire.

25:49.678 --> 25:50.897
So your power went out?

25:50.940 --> 25:53.334
Yeah, for, like, five minutes.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.425
- How long before the fire?
- I don't know.

25:57.468 --> 26:00.036
Maybe 20, 30 minutes?

26:00.080 --> 26:02.735
Okay, well...

26:02.778 --> 26:04.606
We're not sure
who you should sue just yet,

26:04.650 --> 26:06.303
but... we'll let you know.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.871
Awesome. Thanks.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.874
That explains
the cameras going out.

26:11.918 --> 26:15.312
Yeah, but who killed the power?

26:32.155 --> 26:33.766
The case is intact,

26:33.809 --> 26:35.376
so unless someone
had a tag tool...

26:35.419 --> 26:36.962
Well, that narrows
the suspect pool down

26:36.986 --> 26:38.901
to pretty much
everyone at ComEd.

26:38.945 --> 26:43.427
Hang on...

26:43.471 --> 26:46.430
Rust.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.961
Fresh cut on the locking tab.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.963
Somebody stealthed their way
into the meter.

26:57.006 --> 26:59.879
They turn the power off,
the cameras go down,

26:59.922 --> 27:01.750
they get inside,
they do what they need to...

27:01.794 --> 27:03.491
And they turn the power back on.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.972
And no one's the wiser.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.409
Do you guys smell that?

27:15.068 --> 27:16.983
Does this look familiar to you?

27:17.026 --> 27:19.681
I don't know. Why, should it?

27:36.219 --> 27:39.005
God.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.421
Arsonist cuts the power,
kills the dog.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.684
Cameras, alarms.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.076
Everything goes offline.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.512
They're free to get inside,

28:08.556 --> 28:10.123
douse the place with accelerant.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.647
And set a timing device.
That's the key.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.431
- They found one?
- No, but it was probably

28:14.475 --> 28:15.998
destroyed in the fire.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.958
Point is,
the guy can set everything up,

28:19.001 --> 28:21.282
turn the power back on, put
the locking tab back in place.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.266
It makes it look
like an inside job...

28:23.310 --> 28:25.181
And the arsonist is in the wind.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.097
Exactly.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.099
We've seen this before, right?

28:30.143 --> 28:32.058
What do you mean? Same M.O.?

28:32.101 --> 28:34.756
Yeah... Not the dog necessarily,

28:34.800 --> 28:37.585
but the electric meter?

28:37.628 --> 28:39.413
- Refresh my memory?
- I don't know.

28:39.456 --> 28:42.242
It just feel familiar somehow.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.418
Well...

28:44.461 --> 28:46.376
Whoever this guy is...

28:46.420 --> 28:48.291
he's a nasty piece of work.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.487
We still keeping the old
arson files in the blue office?

28:50.511 --> 28:53.296
Yeah, lumped in
with all the non-arson cases.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.534
It'll take a while
to go through it.

28:54.558 --> 28:57.431
I got time.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.783
Kevin Klinginpill?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
Yeah, he filled in for Ritter
a few weeks back?

29:03.829 --> 29:06.092
- No, I remember.
- Here's the thing, Chief.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.007
He's been stuck in
the floater pool for ages,

29:08.050 --> 29:11.140
and he'd just really like
to find a permanent home.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.794
And?

29:12.838 --> 29:18.104
And, well, we just thought,
you know, maybe 51

29:18.147 --> 29:20.323
would be a good place for him?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.499
Herrmann, you hated Klinginpill.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.423
In fact, his mere presence
was an issue for you.

29:24.458 --> 29:28.592
I... didn't really give him
a fair shake.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.556
What's going on here?

29:38.646 --> 29:40.232
Franz was right about
the piercing nozzle.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.712
We had it all along,
and we didn't realize it.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.192
We tried to sneak
it back over there,

29:43.216 --> 29:44.347
but Klinginpill caught us.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.784
Yeah, thanks to Sneezy
over here.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.655
So now I have to give
Klinginpill a home

29:47.698 --> 29:49.265
in order to keep him quiet.

29:49.309 --> 29:50.353
I'm afraid so...

29:50.397 --> 29:51.790
It's that or you get to call.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.182
Chief Lydon and eat crow.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.097
We're real sorry about this,
Chief.

29:57.317 --> 30:00.059
Me too.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.455
You know, Klinginpill
probably won't last too long

30:05.499 --> 30:08.284
once he finds out
what a busy house this is.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.374
Hey, Steve. Wallace.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.854
I owe you an apology.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.465
Turns out my men
had your nozzle after all.

30:15.509 --> 30:18.381
Should be back in your hands
now, though.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.123
Let me extend an olive branch
by sending these knuckleheads

30:21.167 --> 30:24.866
over to wash all your rigs
from stem to stern.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.215
Sound good?

30:26.259 --> 30:27.564
Yeah.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.350
You take care.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.482
Will there be anything else?

30:32.526 --> 30:35.355
I guess not. Thank you, Chief.

30:38.924 --> 30:42.666
Next time, try an antihistamine.

30:47.715 --> 30:51.414
Hey, what is all this?

30:51.458 --> 30:54.896
Every arson 51
has ever responded to.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.290
Something about
the salon fire...

30:57.333 --> 30:59.770
I've seen it before.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.252
Isn't OFI looking into it?

31:03.296 --> 31:07.213
Yeah, but you know.
Two heads better than one.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.347
What?

31:11.391 --> 31:12.696
Nothing. You just...

31:12.740 --> 31:14.263
you said you were gonna head up

31:14.307 --> 31:16.787
to Benny's cabin after shift.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.225
Cabin's not going anywhere.

31:20.530 --> 31:23.316
Welland all that stuff
in your car?

31:23.359 --> 31:25.405
What about it?

31:26.841 --> 31:28.712
I don't know.
Maybe going through it,

31:28.756 --> 31:30.932
getting up to the cabin...

31:30.976 --> 31:34.936
might be cathartic somehow.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.677
I'll get there...

31:36.720 --> 31:39.680
but I want
to figure this out first.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.250
Okay.

31:44.293 --> 31:47.818
I'm around, you know,
if you need any help

31:47.862 --> 31:49.516
sorting out the cabin

31:49.559 --> 31:51.822
or whatever.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.740
Okay. Thanks.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.317
Okay, let's get this party
started!

32:08.361 --> 32:09.928
All right, where's Chloe?

32:09.971 --> 32:11.842
She had a work thing.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.323
- She'll be here later.
- Ooh...

32:14.367 --> 32:17.413
What year was Pluto discovered?

32:17.457 --> 32:21.504
1922,

32:21.548 --> 32:23.506
1930!

32:23.550 --> 32:24.855
Are you serious with this?

32:24.899 --> 32:26.857
Yeah, how about music
and film questions?

32:26.901 --> 32:28.685
- Thirty seconds.
- My God.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.533
Any geography questions?
I'm pretty good with those.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.254
Me too. I used to have a globe

32:32.298 --> 32:34.450
by my bed when I was little,
and I'd spin that thing around

32:34.474 --> 32:35.954
when I was falling asleep.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.437
What about you?
What's your category?

32:37.477 --> 32:39.566
Definitely not geography.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.698
I still get lost in Chicago
all the time

32:41.742 --> 32:44.223
and I grew up here.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.754
The margaritas
are so good, Sylvie.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They really are.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.543
- Ten seconds.
- Fine, fine.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.284
1925.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.286
1930.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.960
Have none of you taken
a single science class?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.028
Easy, killer. Game night

33:07.072 --> 33:09.596
is supposed to be fun.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.469
Um, okay.
Let's switch to charades.

33:13.513 --> 33:17.386
- Yes!
- All right, come on.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.387
- TV show.
- Okay.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.867
Now we're talking.

33:19.910 --> 33:22.565
- Wait!
- No, that's one word.

33:22.609 --> 33:25.786
I mean,
never played charades before?

33:25.829 --> 33:30.399
You know, you're really mean
on game night.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.706
That was a genuine question!

33:32.749 --> 33:34.490
I wasn't being mean.

33:34.534 --> 33:35.839
All right, let's keep going.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.581
TV show, one word.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.757
- Driver...
- "Riverdale"!

33:40.801 --> 33:43.064
- "Speed Racer"!
- No, it's "Top Gear"!

33:43.108 --> 33:46.328
You are climbing something.

33:48.374 --> 33:51.725
- "Emergency"!
- Yes!

33:51.768 --> 33:53.422
- Ha!
- What?

33:53.466 --> 33:55.990
There's a TV show called
"Emergency"?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.906
How in the hell...?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.519
That was impressive.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.782
He's great, right?

34:05.826 --> 34:07.915
Really great.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.960
All right, ready?

34:14.748 --> 34:18.360
Hey, Severide.
Somebody to see you.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.321
Hey, Niya.

34:25.411 --> 34:28.936
I'm really sorry about your dog.

34:28.978 --> 34:30.851
- I didn't start that fire.
- I know.

34:30.893 --> 34:33.003
We're way past that theory.
You have to find whoever did.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.918
We're going to do everything
we can, I promise.

34:34.942 --> 34:38.554
No, you have to find him.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.904
The surgeons couldn't help her.

34:40.947 --> 34:42.819
Miriam.

34:42.862 --> 34:45.605
She'll never walk again.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.277
- Hubble.
- Lieutenant.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.081
Something about this case
was nagging at me,

35:07.105 --> 35:08.367
like I've seen it before.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.064
But I've gone back over
every arson case

35:10.108 --> 35:12.588
at 51 over the last ten years
and I can't find it.

35:12.632 --> 35:16.940
I was hoping I could go through
your system, maybe...

35:18.594 --> 35:20.509
What's that?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.207
The timing device.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.402
We actually overlooked it
at first thinking it was just

35:24.426 --> 35:26.559
something the salon used
for color treatments.

35:26.602 --> 35:29.170
Then we noticed that insulated
wire taped to the side

35:29.214 --> 35:31.085
and the charred remains
of a matchstick

35:31.129 --> 35:32.529
preserved under
tape on the pointer.

35:32.565 --> 35:35.350
So start the timer
and the matchstick rotates

35:35.394 --> 35:37.004
and then hits the wires and...

35:37.047 --> 35:38.484
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

35:38.527 --> 35:40.007
What's wrong?

35:40.050 --> 35:44.185
Nothing, I just...

35:44.229 --> 35:47.319
Need to check something.

35:52.759 --> 35:56.197
Hey guys, make sure
you get the wheel wells.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.590
Lotta road salt up in there.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.635
- Buzz off, Klinginpill.
- I'm just saying.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.638
Hey, you know, we're real sorry

36:02.682 --> 36:05.032
we couldn't get you
a permanent spot over at 51.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.077
That's okay. Franz brought me on

36:07.121 --> 36:10.211
full time here at 27.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.647
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.519
He thought I was full of it
when I told him

36:13.562 --> 36:15.042
you brought back
the piercing nozzle,

36:15.085 --> 36:16.783
but Boden confirmed it.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.046
Suddenly I'm looking
pretty good.

36:19.089 --> 36:22.049
That's great.
Really, good for you.

36:22.092 --> 36:24.138
Ooh...

36:24.182 --> 36:28.229
Sorry. Careful there.

36:28.273 --> 36:31.363
You guys are the best.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.408
Thanks for all you did for me.

36:33.452 --> 36:37.020
Having a permanent home,
it's gonna change my life.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.027
That was an amazing class.

36:44.071 --> 36:47.292
Thanks!
I just heard from Claire.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.573
Stitches are coming out
next week.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.033
She swears she'll be back.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.557
Good for her.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.516
Um, look.
I know it got a little rowdy

36:54.560 --> 36:56.257
at the end of the party
the other night,

36:56.301 --> 36:57.843
so I'm not sure if you had
a chance to exchange numbers

36:57.867 --> 36:59.521
with Casey,
but I'm sure he'd be cool

36:59.565 --> 37:00.672
with me giving you his info.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.177
He is an awesome guy.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.483
You were right.

37:04.526 --> 37:05.764
See, I told you I wouldn't
steer you wrong.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.051
Yeah, the thing is...

37:08.095 --> 37:10.489
He's not your type?

37:10.532 --> 37:13.318
Sylvie...

37:13.361 --> 37:16.843
you're the one who should be
with Matt Casey, not me.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.149
- You know that, right?
- What?

37:19.193 --> 37:21.108
No! No, no, no.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.431
He was married
to my best friend.

37:22.457 --> 37:23.695
- Okay.
- No, he's definitely...

37:23.719 --> 37:26.679
Come on! Come on, I sat next to

37:26.722 --> 37:28.463
the two of you the whole night.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.074
You were meant for each other.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.782
- Matt.
- Hey.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.827
Come on in.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.744
How are you?

37:48.788 --> 37:50.268
I'm good.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.530
Glad to hear it.

37:51.573 --> 37:54.533
What can I do for you?

37:54.576 --> 37:57.231
When you and Sylvie broke up,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.886
the whole point of that
was so the relationship

37:59.929 --> 38:02.105
wouldn't interfere
with your job.

38:02.149 --> 38:04.412
- Right?
- That's right.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.853
But I haven't been checking in

38:10.897 --> 38:12.725
on the folks at 51
very much, have I?

38:12.768 --> 38:16.337
That's not good.

38:16.381 --> 38:20.472
I was just trying to be
sensitive to Sylvie.

38:20.515 --> 38:22.256
I get that.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.519
But she's tough.

38:24.563 --> 38:28.741
And she can handle a little
awkwardness from time to time.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.396
And the gang at 51 needs you.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.703
It would be good for us
and for Sylvie.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.579
Then I'll be there.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.451
Thank you.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.370
She is tough...

38:49.414 --> 38:51.807
isn't she?

38:51.851 --> 38:55.463
She is. She's a great girl.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.554
The best.

40:48.054 --> 40:51.405
I know who torched
the hair salon...

40:51.449 --> 40:54.364
someone my dad was hunting
for 15 years.
