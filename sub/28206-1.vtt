WEBVTT

00:52.077 --> 00:54.955
New York, three months later.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.753
Slightly cloudy and scurvy,
but it seems to be blown away now.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.929
Self-psychology

01:29.531 --> 01:32.409
- I check the record.
- Okay.

02:13.784 --> 02:15.869
That's me.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.581
Yeah ... I just got it.

02:20.958 --> 02:24.169
No ...
somewhere in the living room.

02:26.171 --> 02:28.257
Did you find out something?

02:30.717 --> 02:34.221
Good.
We'll see you in three days.

02:48.402 --> 02:52.156
Don't forget to call the AC.
It's too hot in the apartment.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.284
- I will fix it.
- Thanks.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.536
I think the AC works now.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.666
It's you ... that's for hot.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.587
- Are you trying to seduce me?
- No. Perhaps.

03:06.670 --> 03:09.506
- Does it work?
- Maybe you should make more effort.

03:12.718 --> 03:16.764
- Hey, turtle doves.
- Hey, Kate.

03:16.847 --> 03:19.183
How's it going?

03:19.266 --> 03:22.436
- I have to knit, honey.
- Yes.

03:22.519 --> 03:27.608
- Nice trip, Linz.
- Thanks. We are seen in a couple of days.

03:27.691 --> 03:30.110
Bye honey.

03:34.239 --> 03:36.450
Bye.

03:47.878 --> 03:52.549
Let me guess ... You got lost

03:52.633 --> 03:54.718
Almost there

04:15.406 --> 04:20.077
- Come here. How nice to see you.
- Same thing.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.038
- How was the run?
- Long.

04:23.122 --> 04:27.376
- New York, what is it? 18 hours?
- 20.

04:27.459 --> 04:31.088
Well, if you didn't go
we had met more often.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.550
- What we do for love.
- Yes, it is usually called so.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.553
- So where is she?
- A few days in Greece.

04:37.636 --> 04:41.432
I didn't say you were coming.
She will be very happy.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.518
Let me show you our place.

04:44.601 --> 04:48.397
Yes I did.
I'll fix it all at once.

04:49.565 --> 04:52.401
Okay. Bye.

04:52.484 --> 04:57.781
I have to send an email to a
colleague, but feel at home

04:57.865 --> 05:02.369
- And when you finish you will come
up to apartment 12 opposite the pool.

05:03.954 --> 05:06.874
- Okay?
- Yeah.

05:24.767 --> 05:27.269
- Hey hottie.
- I forgot to tell you ...

05:27.352 --> 05:30.564
- ... how much I love you.
- I love you too, Linz.

05:30.647 --> 05:34.693
- Are you at the airport?
- Yes, the traffic was good for once.

05:34.777 --> 05:40.908
- You bleed, the gold. Are you okay?
- I think so.

05:40.991 --> 05:43.994
The last time I
blew was in five.

05:46.663 --> 05:51.627
It must be the heat. How to preferably
I have to go before I get late.

05:51.710 --> 05:55.589
- Call me when you arrive. Bye.
- Bye.

07:09.997 --> 07:17.755
- Hello. Welcome. What do you think?
- Your collection has grown.

07:17.838 --> 07:22.092
Yes it has.
And check out my favorite supplement.

07:22.176 --> 07:26.388
El Santo. Okay, son,
but I'll tell you one thing.

07:26.472 --> 07:32.519
He definitely follows in his dad's
footsteps. You should see his hope.

07:32.603 --> 07:35.022
When did you start reading?

07:36.273 --> 07:41.195
That's Lindsays.
Old books is apparently her new thing.

07:43.322 --> 07:48.452
I was going to have a barbecue a little
later. I introduce you to some friends.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.663
- Will.
- Sarah, just listen to me.

07:51.747 --> 07:57.127
I know it was two years since yours
parents died. It has been tough

07:57.211 --> 08:05.552
- But you have to move on. That's why I wanted
to get you here and think about something else.

08:06.178 --> 08:10.390
Let go of thinking about work and relax.
A small holiday.

08:12.893 --> 08:17.397
- What are you saying?
- I'll try, okay?

08:17.481 --> 08:19.733
I'll try.

08:46.552 --> 08:50.139
No, I only eat vegas.

08:50.222 --> 08:53.100
These burgers will ...

08:53.183 --> 08:56.145
- Do you think they are ready?
- No, it doesn't look like that.

08:59.314 --> 09:04.653
- They are not vegetarian.
- You've never eaten better, trust me.

09:05.946 --> 09:11.702
Sarah, come here. This is Sarah.
Sarah, this is Zac.

09:11.785 --> 09:17.499
- Kate, the world's best nurse.
- Stop.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.294
- It's been the first time in Florida?
- Yes it is true.

09:20.377 --> 09:23.338
- She drove right here, do you?
- For real?

09:23.422 --> 09:29.762
- I like it. Poetry than flying.
- Sure she's foam?

09:30.512 --> 09:33.557
- Alex, greet Sarah.
- Hello.

09:36.852 --> 09:40.939
- Is that all?
- You basically met everyone here now.

09:41.023 --> 09:46.528
- It's only you four.
- Zac exaggerates. We live here all year round.

09:46.612 --> 09:51.450
I've been living here for over a year.
But they other tenants come and go.

09:51.533 --> 09:55.287
- Okay, it sounds a little depressing.
- No, that's right shit actually.

09:55.370 --> 09:58.707
We get the pool for ourselves
and we can have awesome parties.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.334
Next is tomorrow.

10:00.417 --> 10:03.962
- You're invited.
- Thanks.

10:04.046 --> 10:08.634
- Okay, who wants a burger?
- I'm hungry.

10:08.717 --> 10:11.804
Do you want cheese on it.
What do you want?

10:20.854 --> 10:24.608
- Here.
- You're not sure here. Go at once.

10:24.691 --> 10:28.362
Sarah, don't you?

10:28.445 --> 10:34.410
- Alex! Where are you going?
- I have a lot to do. Thanks for the beer.

10:36.578 --> 10:41.625
- He's having trouble.
- Let him be. He's just foam.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.836
Sarah, more to drink?

10:45.045 --> 10:49.550
I don't know what you think,
but the burger made me really hot.

10:49.633 --> 10:53.303
As if you need an apology
to take off your t-shirt.

10:54.805 --> 10:59.810
- I took off the mask and everyone got scared.
- Was it Linz's idea?

10:59.893 --> 11:04.273
- They said they were going to the cinema, so ...
- I remember you being terrified.

11:06.108 --> 11:10.988
- It sounds like Lindsay.
- Yes. How did you meet?

11:11.071 --> 11:14.700
Her parents moved in next to
mine in Texas when we were seven.

11:14.783 --> 11:22.166
I happened to kick in a ball on
her farm and she was so shy ...

11:22.249 --> 11:25.210
... but gave it back, so ...

11:25.294 --> 11:29.465
I could only speak Spanish, so it was
difficult to understand each other.

11:29.548 --> 11:31.550
A little like now.

11:34.178 --> 11:38.557
- We still managed to make friends.
- Like siblings.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.812
And then we took the student and
moved to New York to go to college.

11:44.646 --> 11:49.818
Schyst. Didn't you have
night shift tonight?

11:49.902 --> 11:56.492
Yes, in an hour.
Zinder Cooperation need my expertise ...

11:56.575 --> 12:02.623
... to keep hackers away. Have that fun
now, so we are seen at lunch tomorrow.

12:02.706 --> 12:06.752
- Sure.
- Adios miss amigos.

12:07.795 --> 12:13.342
I'll go too. You got my number if
you want to go to the beach tomorrow.

12:13.425 --> 12:16.053
- Okay.
- Bye.

12:40.077 --> 12:45.916
- So ... what do you do besides sunbathing?
- People are shooting me.

12:45.999 --> 12:50.295
- For magazines and stuff.
- Interesting.

12:53.298 --> 12:55.884
- I see you're training.
- Do you think?

12:55.968 --> 12:59.263
- Sarcastic?
- Not at all.

13:01.515 --> 13:06.186
- I just want to know what you think about me.
- Imagine if I don't want to tell you.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.774
I think you just did it.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.770
What a great start.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.908
- Sarah, are you okay?
- I was in the living room.

18:10.991 --> 18:17.372
- And it felt like I was in water.
- Have you been drinking too much?

18:19.249 --> 18:21.627
I drank a little.

18:23.587 --> 18:27.007
But, no ... I swear I ...
I do not understand.

18:27.091 --> 18:32.513
Sarah, I think you're just exhausted.
A long journey in combination with alcohol.

18:32.596 --> 18:38.811
- Maybe you should just sleep.
- Yes, you're probably right.

18:40.938 --> 18:45.484
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes thank you.

18:45.567 --> 18:49.571
- Okay good night.
- Good night.

19:24.857 --> 19:27.067
We have no pulse.

19:33.198 --> 19:35.284
Look at me.

21:54.715 --> 21:58.177
Sarah? Sarah.

21:58.260 --> 22:01.555
- It's me, Alex. Quiet.
- What is happening?

22:01.638 --> 22:03.766
Calm down.

22:07.102 --> 22:09.146
Follow me.

22:31.627 --> 22:34.379
Here, you're wet.

22:35.255 --> 22:40.552
Something pulled me
down in the pool.

22:40.636 --> 22:42.888
But there was nothing there.

22:45.933 --> 22:50.395
A few months ago, a girl disappeared
who was here on vacation.

22:50.479 --> 22:57.069
Her name was Jennifer. The police were looking
for her, but they never find her again.

22:57.152 --> 22:59.363
What do you mean?

23:00.197 --> 23:04.868
I saw what happened to her.
She disappeared into the pool.

23:07.204 --> 23:10.833
So I'm not crazy then.
We have to call the police.

23:10.916 --> 23:16.588
Do you think they believe in something like
that? In addition, I would be suspected.

23:16.672 --> 23:22.845
- I have to tell Will.
- Patience the companion of wisdom.

23:22.928 --> 23:26.765
Get to a safe place first
and then you can call Will.

24:15.189 --> 24:18.776
This is Will. I'm not here,
but will return as soon as I can.

24:18.859 --> 24:21.987
Will, something has happened.

24:23.155 --> 24:29.161
I am at Motel Sunrise.
Call or come here when you hear this.

25:12.955 --> 25:15.374
- Liza.
- Hello.

25:15.457 --> 25:17.751
- Are you going out?
- Yes, Mr. Brook.

25:17.835 --> 25:19.920
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

25:20.003 --> 25:24.842
- Have fun, but be careful out there.
- Yes, have a nice evening.

26:17.227 --> 26:21.482
- What do you want?
- Something strange is happening in the residential area.

26:25.652 --> 26:29.031
- And why should I bother?
- I want someone to witness it.

26:29.114 --> 26:32.409
Do you have no friends? Wait.

26:32.493 --> 26:36.246
Jim, you don't understand.
We can serve lots of money on this.

26:36.330 --> 26:39.374
But we have to do something
before anyone else does.

26:39.458 --> 26:43.629
- What is that?
- Come see for yourself.

26:44.379 --> 26:49.468
Let me tell you one thing, your little
shit. If I go down there for nothing ...

26:49.551 --> 26:54.389
- ... then you pay for my time.
- You won't be disappointed, I promise.

26:54.473 --> 26:58.936
I've heard that before.
See you right away.

27:14.118 --> 27:16.995
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

27:25.504 --> 27:28.924
Sarah, sorry if I'm upright ...

27:29.007 --> 27:33.262
... but I have to ask.
Is it safe to you do not take any drugs?

27:33.345 --> 27:39.393
I know we do not know each other,
but I'm not taking drugs, okay?

27:39.476 --> 27:44.731
Okay. I just have a hard time Believe
in everything you told on the phone.

27:44.815 --> 27:49.653
I don't understand it either, but I promise
that something was trying to kill me tonight.

27:50.404 --> 27:55.784
And you claim that Alex saw
the girl disappear in the pool?

27:55.868 --> 27:58.954
After what happened to me
There is no need to doubt.

27:59.037 --> 28:02.332
I guess that's why He looks
at the water all day long.

28:02.416 --> 28:06.420
Why didn't Will mention that
a girl disappeared there?

28:06.503 --> 28:12.801
Did he not? I thought so.
He might just try to protect you.

28:16.180 --> 28:20.517
- Have you never felt anything strange?
- No.

28:20.601 --> 28:26.774
- But when you swam in the pool then?
- We bathe everywhere.

28:26.857 --> 28:29.109
I don't know what to say.

28:30.652 --> 28:35.741
- You have to think I'm crazy.
- No, I do not.

28:35.824 --> 28:39.828
I'm just trying
to understand it.

28:39.912 --> 28:42.748
I just know I'm scared.

28:43.665 --> 28:50.130
You do not need to be that.
Would it feel better if I stayed?

28:50.964 --> 28:53.967
- Yes, I would appreciate that, thank you.
- Okay.

29:03.852 --> 29:08.148
I had forgotten how ugly it was here.
It suits you well.

29:09.316 --> 29:15.114
- Hey, Jim.
- So ... what did you want to show me?

29:15.948 --> 29:19.159
- That's right there.
- In the pool?

29:22.329 --> 29:24.498
I do not see anything.

29:27.835 --> 29:29.878
Damn it too!

29:34.883 --> 29:38.804
- I'll shoot you the skull.
- Mom made the mistake ...

29:38.887 --> 29:43.183
... to marry you. She was naive and
didn't realize you just wanted the money.

29:43.267 --> 29:48.397
- Then you killed her.
- What are you talking about? It was cancer.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.275
She got sick because of you!

29:52.443 --> 29:56.655
- You beat her ...
- Alex, what's this?

29:56.739 --> 29:58.949
... and humiliated her.

30:00.826 --> 30:04.580
- And took home other women.
- What's this, Alex?

30:04.663 --> 30:07.875
She was too scared
to ask for help.

30:07.958 --> 30:11.253
And when she died
I became your prey.

30:12.212 --> 30:16.508
You came here when you realized she created
an account in my name you cannot touch.

30:18.510 --> 30:24.016
Alex! Alex, forgive me.
You have to quit.

30:24.099 --> 30:26.310
It is too late.

30:30.773 --> 30:34.068
- It wants you.
- Alex.

30:34.151 --> 30:36.320
Please stop.

30:46.747 --> 30:48.832
What happens?

30:48.916 --> 30:54.421
- It was like the water enveloped me.
- What water?

30:54.505 --> 30:58.842
It's completely dry here.
It was just a nightmare.

30:58.926 --> 31:01.220
It felt so genuine.

31:03.514 --> 31:09.394
- I'm sorry I woke you up.
- No, you're upset, I get it.

31:16.026 --> 31:20.781
It feels like I'm getting
crazy or something.

31:24.743 --> 31:31.750
You know ... When I and my little sister
were children we used to share bed-

31:31.834 --> 31:35.796
And when she had
nightmares I said:

31:35.879 --> 31:38.257
"Take my place and my dreams, -

31:38.340 --> 31:41.969
- I'll take your nightmares
and throw away remove them ".

31:45.848 --> 31:48.267
Did it work?

31:48.350 --> 31:50.436
Well ...

31:57.568 --> 32:00.946
She at least slept like a baby.

32:01.029 --> 32:03.240
Thanks.

32:55.959 --> 32:58.087
It must be Will.

33:02.216 --> 33:05.260
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

33:05.344 --> 33:09.765
I got your message when I arrived Home.
What happens?

33:32.621 --> 33:38.210
You know the guards standing outside
Buckingham Palace in England?

33:38.293 --> 33:42.840
They could hire you.
You have everything they are looking for.

33:42.923 --> 33:48.053
Immobility ...
and absolutely no emotions.

33:52.808 --> 33:56.520
See. You are perfect.

34:03.277 --> 34:09.366
I didn't want to scare you. It was dumb,
but the police thought she was kidnapped.

34:09.449 --> 34:13.620
She met someone at the party
and probably followed ...

34:13.704 --> 34:16.290
Will? Are you okay?

34:16.373 --> 34:19.543
- Will? What is it?
- My stomach.

34:19.626 --> 34:21.920
God, you bleed.

34:22.004 --> 34:25.757
- I'm okay.
- Here, lean your head back.

34:28.342 --> 34:31.304
Abdominal pain and blood ...
That was how it started.

34:31.388 --> 34:34.808
- Lindsay blew nosebleeds yesterday.
- Could it be any symptom?

34:34.891 --> 34:37.728
It's not true.
That woman was right.

34:37.811 --> 34:40.147
She has met a prophecy.

34:41.565 --> 34:46.070
Ever since her mother died she has
tried to get in touch with her.

34:46.152 --> 34:50.032
I never took it seriously,
but a few days before the girl disappeared

34:50.114 --> 34:55.329
- she told Lindsay that death
surrounds the residential area.

34:56.871 --> 34:58.791
Okay, I could meet her,

34:58.874 --> 35:01.251
- Then she can tell if
the building is plagued.

35:01.335 --> 35:05.130
- No, you have to go back to New York.
- Will is right, you should.

35:05.214 --> 35:09.176
- At least until it gets normal again.
- I need answers.

35:09.259 --> 35:16.517
In addition, we are all affected by something
here. Lindsay can also be in danger.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.727
- Will?
- Okay.

35:18.811 --> 35:21.855
- I can accompany you.
- Okay.

35:21.939 --> 35:28.153
I go home, do some research and
see if I can find something, okay?

35:37.454 --> 35:39.665
Thanks.

35:53.178 --> 35:57.558
- Yeah?
- Are you the Samara prophecy?

35:57.641 --> 36:02.896
The best you will meet. And my
services are expensive, little girl.

36:02.980 --> 36:05.524
- I can pay.
- Cash.

36:07.276 --> 36:09.611
Of course.

36:13.323 --> 36:19.204
Sure, but whatever we see
or do not see today ...

36:19.288 --> 36:22.624
- ... you won't get any money back.
- Sure. Yes.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.710
Follow me.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.211
Sit down.

37:32.986 --> 37:35.155
Why did you come here today?

37:35.239 --> 37:39.660
I think there is something in the
residential area where I live.

37:39.743 --> 37:44.123
Do not say anything.
The spirits do it.

37:54.216 --> 37:57.261
Give me your hands. Relax.

37:58.262 --> 38:00.431
Relax.

38:01.598 --> 38:04.560
Breathe and relax.

38:49.521 --> 38:53.609
Nothing. They do not want
to communicate today.

38:54.902 --> 38:57.863
You may come back
somebody else walk.

38:57.946 --> 38:59.740
Please, can't you try again?

39:08.665 --> 39:12.211
What? Do you see anything?

39:15.589 --> 39:18.092
- Did you hear?
- No.

39:18.175 --> 39:20.969
- You heard.
- No, I didn't hear anything.

39:22.304 --> 39:24.598
Water...

39:25.682 --> 39:28.268
There is nothing here.
There is no water.

39:31.438 --> 39:33.482
Oh no...

39:35.401 --> 39:37.528
What is happening?

39:45.035 --> 39:47.329
Alex!

39:48.330 --> 39:50.416
Please stop!

39:54.086 --> 39:56.296
You scare me.

40:10.352 --> 40:13.147
If it's a joke, it's not fun.

40:14.481 --> 40:18.235
You have to go from here now!
I can not help you.

40:18.318 --> 40:23.615
Come back someplace else.
You have to go now.

40:23.699 --> 40:28.829
- Okay sure. But please tell me.
- Unfortunately, I can't help you.

40:28.912 --> 40:33.584
- And honestly you are in great danger.
- But ...

40:33.667 --> 40:36.837
- What should I do?
- Go away!

40:37.755 --> 40:40.132
Please tell me.

40:50.476 --> 40:53.896
- What happened?
- I do not know.

40:53.979 --> 40:58.567
I think she saw something that scared her.
She said I was in danger.

40:58.650 --> 41:03.072
- What did she see?
- She didn't tell. She threw me out.

41:03.155 --> 41:07.451
She tricked you into money.
Come now.

41:07.534 --> 41:13.457
- You probably don't believe this, right?
- Sorry, Sarah. I have no doubt about you.

41:13.540 --> 41:19.254
But I know that sometimes even the senses
play one a poop and one sees vision errors.

41:20.089 --> 41:23.592
If so, how could Alex watch
the girl disappear in the pool?

41:23.675 --> 41:28.931
Why didn't he save her in that case?
Did you ask him?

41:30.140 --> 41:34.353
- No I do not know.
- I have to be at work in an hour.

41:34.436 --> 41:39.233
If you want you can come with me to
the hospital. We can take some samples.

41:39.316 --> 41:44.154
- Maybe it's just a cold.
- Just drive me to the motel.

41:44.238 --> 41:47.699
- I'm waiting for Will to call.
- Sure.

41:54.915 --> 41:58.794
- Hi, the gold.
- Hey, how was the flight?

41:58.877 --> 42:01.588
- Long.
- Sarah is here.

42:01.672 --> 42:04.758
- Why? What is she doing there?
- She wanted to visit this weekend ...

42:04.842 --> 42:08.303
- ... and we were going to surprise you.
- It's not a good idea, why didn't you say anything?

42:08.387 --> 42:10.514
Why, Lindsay?

42:12.141 --> 42:15.602
- Because you saw the girl disappear in the pool?
- Have you read my diary?

42:15.686 --> 42:18.605
- Someone was about to ...
- Wait.

42:20.274 --> 42:22.317
Linz?

42:24.111 --> 42:26.238
What was that?

42:28.949 --> 42:32.995
- Lindsay?
- Sorry, it was just Vasillis.

42:34.413 --> 42:39.293
- Hi. The taxi is here, Lindsay.
- Something is happening in the residential area.

42:39.376 --> 42:42.212
- I think we are all in danger.
- The pool.

42:42.296 --> 42:47.217
- What? Vasillis ... Who is Vasillis?
- I know it sounds snappy ...

42:48.594 --> 42:53.515
... but there's a essence in the water.
I lied to you, Will.

42:53.599 --> 42:58.479
I'm not here at work.
I tried to save the girl in the pool

42:58.562 --> 43:06.737
- But when I got there ... she
disappeared I've done research since then.

43:06.820 --> 43:11.241
- And it brought me to Greece.
- Why did you tell me nothing?

43:11.325 --> 43:15.454
- Did you believe me?
- Probably not.

43:15.537 --> 43:19.708
It is okay.
Listen, There is a way to end it.

43:19.792 --> 43:25.881
- We really have to go now.
- Yes. I'll call you later. Do not worry.

43:25.964 --> 43:28.175
Lindsay, I need to know ...

43:38.352 --> 43:40.354
- Will?
- Yes.

43:40.437 --> 43:43.816
- I just met the prophecy.
- Okay, and?

43:43.899 --> 43:46.193
It was pretty scary.

43:47.361 --> 43:52.449
She said I was in danger. Mentioned
water a few times, but nothing concrete.

43:52.533 --> 43:56.912
Water?
Sarah, that's what Lindsay said.

43:56.995 --> 44:02.668
And she's not in Greece at work,
but to find answers to what is happening.

44:02.751 --> 44:06.922
- She thinks something lives in the pool.
- Wait what?

44:07.005 --> 44:12.511
That's all she said. But just like Alex
saw the Lindsay girl disappear in the pool.

44:13.429 --> 44:18.142
- That she didn't tell you that.
- I know, but that's probably my fault.

44:18.225 --> 44:22.187
A week ago came an old book

44:22.271 --> 44:25.566
- in Greek hit she
started translated.

44:25.649 --> 44:29.778
I was looking in the house, but found nothing.
She took the papers with her safely.

44:29.862 --> 44:33.699
She must have found something important
there. I'll start translating it online.

44:33.782 --> 44:36.243
- No, you have to call back.
- She is not responding.

44:36.326 --> 44:42.499
- Okay, I'll come and help you.
- Sarah, you're not coming here.

44:42.583 --> 44:48.005
Okay. Send some pictures and
call if you find something.

44:48.088 --> 44:51.049
Ok I will do that. Bye.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.805
Do you believe it now?

45:33.425 --> 45:37.429
I just wanted to tell you that you are
not Welcome to the pool party tonight.

45:37.513 --> 45:42.434
- I don't want to scare away my guests.
- You think you're better than me ...

45:42.518 --> 45:47.523
... just because you're posing in front
of one camera and ends up in newspapers.

45:47.606 --> 45:52.903
But you are a narcissist, so people think most
of it and does not see the average measure.

45:52.986 --> 45:59.660
Look, he's talking. Come on. Out with it.
You will feel much better.

46:01.120 --> 46:05.791
- Not?
- What do the women see in you?

46:06.542 --> 46:12.673
- You're empty.
- Seduction is an art you do not understand.

46:12.756 --> 46:17.386
You mean what you did with
the two girls missing?

46:18.679 --> 46:24.518
Yes, the police came a few months ago and
asked questions. I was the only one here.

46:25.352 --> 46:29.356
I recognized them immediately when they
showed up me the pictures. Brandy McDowell-

46:29.440 --> 46:34.778
- from Palm Beach. You had sex with
here in the store. And the other...

46:34.862 --> 46:39.116
Sandra Kirby. You started in the
pool and finished it somewhere else.

46:40.075 --> 46:44.621
You have certain eyes everywhere.
I knew all of this.

46:45.456 --> 46:49.084
And as you can see,
nothing has caught me.

46:57.384 --> 46:59.595
- Zac.
- What happens?

46:59.678 --> 47:02.014
- You have to set up the party.
- Why?

47:02.097 --> 47:07.352
I spoke to Sarah and Lyndsay And
there is something going on here.

47:07.436 --> 47:10.022
There is something in the pool.

47:12.357 --> 47:16.945
- And you believe in that idiot?
- Maybe not him, but Sarah is ...

47:17.029 --> 47:22.951
Will, how often do we bathe there?
It's absurd. Don't be so paranoid.

47:23.035 --> 47:27.831
- I'm not going to party. - If anything
happens, you bear the responsibility.

48:14.711 --> 48:16.880
Old Greek creatures.

49:57.314 --> 49:59.942
What are you doing here?

50:00.025 --> 50:03.862
- Something seems to be stuck in the filter.
- So what did you say to Sarah?

50:03.946 --> 50:07.991
She is in a motel right now and
everyone is terrified of you.

50:08.075 --> 50:11.787
- Maybe you should be, Kate.
- Why?

50:13.288 --> 50:15.749
What do you know?

50:15.833 --> 50:18.127
Alex, what's going on?

50:22.089 --> 50:25.759
If you really want to know you
come to my apartment tonight.

50:31.098 --> 50:33.559
- Something new?
- No, I keep you updated.

50:37.938 --> 50:42.776
- Darling.
- Will, we're going to Meteora on a hilltop.

50:42.860 --> 50:47.573
I do not know if there is coverage
there, but broken it promises ...

50:47.656 --> 50:54.079
- ... trying to call back. - Where does
he take you? Tell me everything you know.

50:54.163 --> 50:57.541
Vasillis takes me ...

50:57.624 --> 51:00.210
Linz?

51:17.436 --> 51:21.148
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here

51:42.211 --> 51:44.880
Imagine he still has a party.

51:45.964 --> 51:50.844
Alex, I'm not like him at all.
I know he is crazy about you.

51:50.928 --> 51:54.181
But you need someone
to talk to ...

51:54.264 --> 51:58.185
Thanks, but I already have.

51:59.061 --> 52:03.190
I saw what happened
with your step paper.

52:04.108 --> 52:09.113
How he treated you when he was here.
I'm really sorry.

52:09.196 --> 52:14.785
You must have had a tough childhood,
But you have to try to open yourself up.

52:16.286 --> 52:20.541
You should have said something
about what you saw in the pool.

52:21.333 --> 52:26.171
First, you know nothing about me.
And secondly, the day is

52:26.255 --> 52:30.008
- when I come and talk to you,
the day you no longer doubt me.

52:30.092 --> 52:32.719
Alex, that's not what I mean.

52:47.985 --> 52:52.823
- Hold it for me.
- I'm starting to worry, where are you?

52:52.906 --> 52:58.370
- Varlaam monastery.
- What are you doing at a monastery?

52:58.454 --> 53:02.583
- We have to find the well.
- What well are you talking about?

53:02.666 --> 53:09.089
This was where it started. 800 years ago the
monks managed to catch the creature here

53:09.173 --> 53:14.261
- from the Dorian Lake. They didn't
lock it in the well with a spell.

53:15.179 --> 53:20.309
But the spell was broken
and it got back its forces.

53:21.435 --> 53:26.440
Those who came into contact
with it can add the spell again

53:26.523 --> 53:31.653
- by touching the water and well,
and send it back in the dark.

53:33.447 --> 53:38.786
I keep it away from humanity.
No one knew where the well was.

53:38.869 --> 53:43.123
Only one book mentions
it and Vasillis found it.

54:05.521 --> 54:08.816
I see you,
but the connection is bad.

54:31.547 --> 54:35.134
- What was that?
- I do not know.

54:40.973 --> 54:44.726
- Oh my God...
- Come now.

54:51.650 --> 54:55.320
- Just continue.
- I don't like this.

54:56.113 --> 54:58.282
Fast.

55:14.256 --> 55:16.425
Come now.

55:19.011 --> 55:21.972
- Here it is.
- Yes.

55:23.682 --> 55:27.519
Here it is. We have arrived.

55:30.481 --> 55:33.567
Lindsay. I remember a
script where it stood ...

55:33.650 --> 55:39.448
... that creature turned the monks
here to slaves to guard the well.

55:39.531 --> 55:42.993
Okay, so you mean there
may be monks there now?

55:43.077 --> 55:48.874
- Hopefully not.
- Linz, can you ... get out of there?

55:48.957 --> 55:51.210
The characters.

56:01.386 --> 56:03.555
Ready?

56:15.943 --> 56:19.655
- Did you hear?
- I don't like this.

56:35.504 --> 56:38.465
Turn off the flashlight.

56:52.980 --> 56:56.775
- Fast, hurry!
- Run, Lindsay! Get out of there!

57:02.156 --> 57:04.408
Follow me.

57:04.491 --> 57:07.870
- What the hell was that?
- The monks.

57:13.542 --> 57:15.669
No, baby.

57:21.633 --> 57:24.303
Lindsay, baby. Talk to me.

57:27.473 --> 57:29.683
Come on, this way.

57:30.476 --> 57:35.898
Baby, listen to me.
I do not like this at all. Get up.

57:35.981 --> 57:42.237
Stick, go back home, and we will solve
everything from here. Please, get out of there.

57:47.743 --> 57:50.329
Okay, hurry up.

57:59.129 --> 58:01.215
Get down.

58:02.841 --> 58:04.968
Get down.

58:10.808 --> 58:13.060
Your flashlight.

58:16.188 --> 58:21.110
Wait, I think I saw something.

58:22.069 --> 58:24.238
Well.

58:25.906 --> 58:30.327
Here, take this. Wait here.

58:30.411 --> 58:32.538
Okay, be careful.

58:49.930 --> 58:54.017
The well is dry.
There is no water in it.

58:54.101 --> 58:59.231
- It's not true.
- No, what are you doing? Lindsay?

58:59.314 --> 59:01.358
Lindsay, come on.

59:02.651 --> 59:07.239
Shit too!
It was our only chance.

59:11.160 --> 59:16.832
- We will all die ...
- Lindsay, listen. No one should die.

59:16.915 --> 59:20.711
Take the first flight
home, and we will solve it!

59:20.794 --> 59:23.839
Came back.
We have to knit, come.

59:29.011 --> 59:31.138
Running!

59:45.069 --> 59:49.698
Baby, are you okay? Are you hurt?
Tell me what happened.

59:49.782 --> 59:54.328
- Tell me what happened.
- I think I killed him.

59:54.411 --> 59:58.540
Get out of there now, okay?
You fix it, you're going home.

59:58.624 --> 01:00:02.711
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry...

01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:06.173
- I should have told you.
- Please ...

01:00:06.256 --> 01:00:10.677
... get up and listen to my
voice, Then you can run at once.

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:15.516
- What's happening with me?
- You will...

01:00:16.475 --> 01:00:21.688
Get out of there. You'll be fine.
You're going home, so we ...

01:00:23.649 --> 01:00:26.860
- Will?
- Baby, it's okay. Trust me.

01:00:26.944 --> 01:00:30.989
Get out of there now. Come on, Lindsay.
You can do it. Get out of there!

01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:34.535
There is water everywhere ...

01:00:34.618 --> 01:00:39.039
No ... Lindsay?

01:00:39.123 --> 01:00:42.209
No ... Lindsay ...

01:00:44.294 --> 01:00:46.380
Lindsay!

01:01:16.785 --> 01:01:19.747
- What is it?
- Lindsay.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:23.292
What? What about Lindsay?

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:25.419
She was in the cloister ...

01:01:27.546 --> 01:01:31.008
- Sarah, she was in the monastery.
- The Varlaam monastery?

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:34.178
- It's about it in the documents.
- She's dead!

01:01:36.764 --> 01:01:39.725
- Lindsay's dead, Sarah.
- No...

01:01:39.808 --> 01:01:44.062
She went to the monastery when she
thought that she could save us all.

01:01:45.314 --> 01:01:49.735
- That thing killed my life's love!
- I'm sorry, Will.

01:01:49.818 --> 01:01:52.071
It doesn't matter ...

01:01:53.238 --> 01:01:57.868
That thing can kill
us wherever we are.

01:01:57.951 --> 01:02:01.914
Maybe,
but we have to fight back.

01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:06.877
I'm not just going to
sit and let it take us.

01:02:07.795 --> 01:02:11.840
There must be a way and stand
in it The documents we find out.

01:02:11.924 --> 01:02:15.469
I don't know if I can, Sarah.
I really do not know.

01:02:15.552 --> 01:02:20.182
Trust me, Will.
I know exactly how you feel.

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:25.562
But had Lindsay been here, she had
wanted us to fight and you know that.

01:02:49.002 --> 01:02:52.881
The phenomenon was first reported
by a Greek traveler who examined

01:02:52.965 --> 01:02:54.133
- a disappearance.

01:02:54.216 --> 01:02:58.429
Many had disappeared under
similar conditions circumstances.

01:02:58.512 --> 01:03:01.974
In Spain, Italy and France.

01:03:02.057 --> 01:03:05.769
They didn't know if it was a
creature or an evil spirit.

01:03:07.062 --> 01:03:13.277
You can find it only in fresh water
and it can get past lakes and wells.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.864
It moves through water and anyone
who comes into contact with it

01:03:16.947 --> 01:03:20.200
- can face a terrible death ...

01:03:20.284 --> 01:03:22.411
... according to its will.

01:03:58.405 --> 01:04:00.741
Oh no...

01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:09.249
- Bowl.
- Cheers, everybody!

01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:16.215
Will, I think I found something important.
Call me. And stay away from water.

01:04:53.877 --> 01:04:54.545
Sarah?

01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:57.131
Are you at home?
Have you talked to someone?

01:04:57.214 --> 01:05:00.384
No, I just got home.
Will does not answer by phone.

01:05:00.467 --> 01:05:05.264
He's in despair.
Something happened to Linz in Greece.

01:05:05.347 --> 01:05:09.309
- What? Lindsay?
- Yes, a trap. She didn't survive.

01:05:09.393 --> 01:05:10.727
God, Lindsay.

01:05:10.811 --> 01:05:12.938
Check out Will.
I have to talk to him.

01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:15.482
Yes of course. Wait.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:22.865
Will? It's Kate, are you there?

01:05:24.366 --> 01:05:27.202
Will?

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:29.913
Will? It's Kate.

01:05:31.248 --> 01:05:34.877
Sarah, he doesn't open the
door, but I hear the shower.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.672
- Kate, listen to me. Don't rely on Zac.
- What does Zac have to do with this?

01:05:38.756 --> 01:05:42.551
The documents state that the
creature is linked to a human being.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:47.264
To survive, the creature must
eat of the victims it chooses.

01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:53.145
- Zac is the one who takes people to the pool.
- Oh, my God, that's not true.

01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:59.443
- Kate, you have to go now.
- Yes, I get there.

01:06:02.112 --> 01:06:04.239
Zac?

01:06:09.995 --> 01:06:12.247
We will miss you, Linz.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:52.079
Will, what are you doing?

01:08:00.773 --> 01:08:02.900
Will ...

01:09:51.175 --> 01:09:54.595
- What are you doing here, idiot?
- I have to meet Sarah.

01:09:54.678 --> 01:09:59.558
I don't think it goes.
We are a little busy if you do.

01:10:05.773 --> 01:10:10.444
Of all the idiotic things I
heard from you then it must ...

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:13.572
- ... be the best.
- Are you saying that?

01:10:13.655 --> 01:10:17.409
Such a girl would never be
interested of an idiot like you.

01:10:17.493 --> 01:10:22.081
- Say it one more time.
- What? Idiot? Should I spell it?

01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:39.306
You chose the wrong person.
You have no idea.

01:10:45.562 --> 01:10:49.525
I could kill you now
without anyone missing you.

01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:55.697
Too easy.

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:14.174
You and I have to talk.

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.189
Zac.

01:12:11.857 --> 01:12:13.817
Was he the one who rescued me?
the pool?

01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:17.154
What are you doing here?
I asked you to go.

01:12:17.237 --> 01:12:21.450
I was in a motel.
That thing was trying to kill me again.

01:12:23.869 --> 01:12:26.997
- Lindsay's dead.
- Crap too.

01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:32.753
Follow me.
I know one who can help us.

01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:40.946
Drive me to the motel
first, I need some clothes.

01:13:41.864 --> 01:13:44.283
What happened to your face?

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.747
- Where are you driving me?
- To my step paper.

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:53.625
- Two at night?
- He knows what to do.

01:13:57.671 --> 01:13:59.798
It's right here.

01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:51.600
He probably went out.
He's coming soon.

01:14:59.733 --> 01:15:03.487
- Can I borrow the toilet?
- It is right there.

01:15:35.686 --> 01:15:37.855
Shit too.

01:15:57.374 --> 01:15:59.710
Is everything okay?

01:16:01.253 --> 01:16:04.465
- Not directly.
- Would you like something to drink?

01:16:05.257 --> 01:16:10.304
No, I just want to put an end to this.
Will he come soon?

01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:14.767
He is not coming.
He's actually dead.

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:17.019
What?

01:16:18.395 --> 01:16:22.858
- What are we doing here, Alex?
- To understand.

01:16:27.863 --> 01:16:32.451
- Open the damned door.
- You're the only one who hasn't succeeded.

01:16:32.534 --> 01:16:34.703
What?

01:16:40.793 --> 01:16:43.754
If you don't let me
go I scream for help.

01:16:44.546 --> 01:16:48.509
Alex, drop me. Please, drop me.

01:16:53.388 --> 01:16:57.059
- You are crazy.
- There are two ways to do this.

01:16:57.142 --> 01:17:00.479
The hard or simple
way you choose.

01:17:00.562 --> 01:17:06.110
- Please, drop me, okay?
- Shut up. With you.

01:17:06.193 --> 01:17:08.904
- With you!
- Okay sure.

01:17:12.449 --> 01:17:14.535
Where.

01:17:18.205 --> 01:17:21.333
So you interact with it?

01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:29.216
- Why?
- Do you know the saying:

01:17:29.299 --> 01:17:33.929
"You are afraid that you do not
know enough? "Don't be afraid.

01:17:34.012 --> 01:17:37.975
- You'll soon find out.
- Don't do it, Alex.

01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:42.813
It will kill me. Please!

01:17:43.605 --> 01:17:46.066
Please, it will kill me.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.778
It'll kill me, Alex.

01:18:14.136 --> 01:18:16.638
No no...

01:19:12.152 --> 01:19:14.196
Can someone help me?

01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:49.857
Shit too.

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.229
Look what I found.

01:20:34.735 --> 01:20:37.404
What does not kill one
makes one stronger.

01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:43.035
- Please stop.
- We learn nothing without pain.

01:20:45.412 --> 01:20:48.207
- Do you want more proverbs?
- I wanted to be sure ...

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:53.462
- ... that the creature couldn't take you.
- Did you put my life in danger for it?

01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:55.714
I know how to kill it.

01:20:56.673 --> 01:20:58.842
I know how to kill it ...

01:20:58.926 --> 01:21:04.932
- Don't dare lie to me again.
- Whoever is connected to the being ...

01:21:05.015 --> 01:21:10.604
... have a mark on the body.
A small scar. I'm sure it's Zac.

01:21:10.687 --> 01:21:13.232
If one kills him,
he also dies väsenet.

01:21:13.315 --> 01:21:15.943
How can you know that?

01:21:16.026 --> 01:21:19.822
I never saw Jennifer
drown, but I knew her.

01:21:19.905 --> 01:21:24.410
The same day she arrived I
felt an instant attraction.

01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:29.123
As if we were together in a past life.
It was so genuine.

01:21:29.873 --> 01:21:33.710
I had never been so happy
late before mom died.

01:21:33.794 --> 01:21:38.465
But two weeks later she was gone.
I called the police.

01:21:38.549 --> 01:21:45.514
I was absolutely sure something had happened.
She couldn't just have ... left me that way.

01:21:45.597 --> 01:21:48.809
A few days later I heard
Lindsay talk on the phone.

01:21:48.892 --> 01:21:50.686
She described what she had seen.

01:21:50.769 --> 01:21:55.607
That Jennifer disappeared in the pool.
Then she started talking about other cases

01:21:55.691 --> 01:22:01.196
- and an evil force. I tried Talk to
her, but she didn't say anything.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.283
So I stole her translations
the day she went.

01:22:04.366 --> 01:22:08.203
If that's true,
why didn't you kill Zac?

01:22:08.287 --> 01:22:13.500
The scriptures mention the well,
though also a legend that a dead host

01:22:13.584 --> 01:22:15.335
-Also, a dead being, -

01:22:15.419 --> 01:22:18.714
- but only if it is done by
someone like that can not drown.

01:22:19.965 --> 01:22:22.301
It's you, Sarah.

01:22:23.719 --> 01:22:26.722
I'm sorry, but I had to be sure.

01:22:28.432 --> 01:22:32.352
- And how do I know you're not the host?
- It can't be me.

01:22:32.436 --> 01:22:35.981
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of water.

01:22:36.064 --> 01:22:40.110
To drown.
I was doing it as a child.

01:22:40.194 --> 01:22:42.529
I don't even know how to swim.

01:23:04.802 --> 01:23:06.929
Undress.

01:23:08.514 --> 01:23:14.436
- Do it, otherwise I'll hit you in the head.
- Okay ... I'll do it.

01:23:59.898 --> 01:24:02.025
Turn around.

01:24:12.703 --> 01:24:14.997
Take them off as well.

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:20.252
Take off the boxer
shorts, I said.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.814
Can I dress again?

01:24:48.572 --> 01:24:50.741
Wait.

01:24:54.912 --> 01:24:57.081
Here, you will need it.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:01.835
And...

01:25:02.628 --> 01:25:05.130
How did you get
rid of the shower?

01:25:05.214 --> 01:25:08.342
Use ... better tape next time.

01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:32.658
Wait, I have to tell
Will what we know.

01:25:53.637 --> 01:25:58.809
Will? It's me, open the door.
He must be in there.

01:26:35.304 --> 01:26:37.556
He's not here.

01:26:39.224 --> 01:26:42.436
- What?
- It's wet.

01:26:45.814 --> 01:26:51.195
It gets through water ...
and anyone who comes into contact with

01:26:51.278 --> 01:26:54.239
- can face a terrible death
according to its will.

01:26:55.949 --> 01:26:59.369
Zac knows we know.
He has certainly killed Kate.

01:26:59.453 --> 01:27:01.205
And even if I
wasn't in the pool-

01:27:01.288 --> 01:27:03.624
-I certainly say next to luck.

01:27:03.707 --> 01:27:05.751
Will ...

01:27:12.925 --> 01:27:18.972
- When will this end?
- Sarah, you can't give up now.

01:27:19.056 --> 01:27:25.270
This may be your only chance.
We must stop it from harming others.

01:27:55.259 --> 01:27:57.386
Where is Kate's
apartment located?

01:28:12.693 --> 01:28:14.737
The bastard!

01:28:49.104 --> 01:28:51.940
Make sure you cut
straight into the heart.

01:31:12.915 --> 01:31:15.501
Hi. Where have you been?

01:31:18.587 --> 01:31:20.756
I have been waiting for you.

01:31:23.425 --> 01:31:27.930
Do not be shy.
I know you want this, too.

01:31:33.435 --> 01:31:37.856
- So you like tough things?
- You killed him, you bastard.

01:31:38.982 --> 01:31:41.610
He was my only family.

01:31:49.284 --> 01:31:51.412
Your bitch.

01:32:09.304 --> 01:32:12.182
- Help!
- Shut up!

01:32:57.895 --> 01:33:00.564
The brand ... The brand ...

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.947
Where is it?

01:33:38.727 --> 01:33:40.854
Alex?

01:33:47.569 --> 01:33:49.863
Alex?

01:34:24.148 --> 01:34:26.275
Alex?

01:34:27.276 --> 01:34:29.445
Wait!

01:34:30.195 --> 01:34:32.406
Alex!

01:34:37.745 --> 01:34:39.788
Alex!

01:34:41.415 --> 01:34:43.542
Alex!

01:34:46.962 --> 01:34:49.047
- Alex.
- What has happened?

01:34:50.257 --> 01:34:55.304
- There was no badge. It wasn't him.
- It is impossible.

01:34:55.387 --> 01:34:59.099
Go and see for yourself.
I killed him.

01:35:03.187 --> 01:35:05.439
Wait. Wait.

01:35:19.912 --> 01:35:22.122
Where is he?

01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:33.717
- Sarah? Zac is not there.
- What?

01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:38.430
- You did it. You got rid of him.
- Do you really think it's over?

01:35:38.514 --> 01:35:40.557
Yes, we are safe now.

01:35:43.811 --> 01:35:46.063
Alex!

01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.159
We thought you were dead.

01:36:10.587 --> 01:36:12.714
You're so naive, Sarah.

01:36:13.757 --> 01:36:16.093
So you are that thing?

01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:22.224
I'm not a thing. I'm Althaia.

01:36:29.773 --> 01:36:34.445
Nereus has been hosting
the last 800 years.

01:36:38.532 --> 01:36:43.370
And I still don't understand
why it didn't kill you yet.

01:36:43.454 --> 01:36:45.873
But I will solve that.

01:37:05.726 --> 01:37:08.729
No Please...

01:37:18.113 --> 01:37:21.658
No Please...

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:45.349
Please ... No ...

01:37:46.183 --> 01:37:53.232
Come here. Come on, Sarah.
Everything has gone so well all year round.

01:37:53.315 --> 01:37:57.736
Zac brought people here all the time
and he was so easy to manipulate.

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.740
Even up there in the room with you.
What a loss.

01:38:01.824 --> 01:38:05.577
When I understood your friends' intentions
was it easy to take care of them ...

01:38:05.661 --> 01:38:11.917
- ...but you...
- It can't kill me, right?

01:39:22.362 --> 01:39:24.948
Let the water take
you, my child.

01:40:43.819 --> 01:40:46.155
Look at me, Alex.

01:40:48.532 --> 01:40:51.618
I'm so disappointed with you.

01:40:54.204 --> 01:40:56.832
I thought you understood.

01:41:47.925 --> 01:41:50.135
Alex.

01:41:51.345 --> 01:41:53.639
Come here.

01:41:55.974 --> 01:41:58.018
Where is she?

01:42:06.235 --> 01:42:08.654
It's over. We are safe.

01:42:15.661 --> 01:42:17.788
You bleed.

01:42:20.082 --> 01:42:22.876
It's from the fight.
It is quiet.

01:42:25.462 --> 01:42:27.798
I'm sorry.

01:42:30.801 --> 01:42:34.263
- We have to go.
- Yes.

01:43:09.131 --> 01:43:11.425
Alex!

01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:26.899
You are alive. What a surprise.

01:43:36.033 --> 01:43:36.658
So you knew?

01:43:36.742 --> 01:43:40.829
Nereus? Yes,
but I couldn't do that something.

01:43:40.913 --> 01:43:43.749
It is incomprehensible.

01:43:43.832 --> 01:43:48.670
In the scripture it says that if I
kill the host, the creature dies.

01:43:49.588 --> 01:43:51.715
But it didn't work.

01:43:52.466 --> 01:43:56.386
To kill such an old
creature is not easy.

01:43:57.679 --> 01:44:01.100
There is a reason that
you are still alive.

01:44:02.768 --> 01:44:06.396
But, I don't understand ...
I saw Kate die.

01:44:10.567 --> 01:44:14.279
It has chosen you.
You are the host now.

01:44:15.155 --> 01:44:17.324
No...

01:44:19.993 --> 01:44:23.872
I don't want this.
I haven't asked for this.

01:44:25.624 --> 01:44:29.753
- Take it away.
- It offers you eternal life.

01:44:31.088 --> 01:44:35.426
All you have to do is to
sacrifice human souls to it.

01:44:37.928 --> 01:44:40.305
But there is a way to kill it.

01:44:56.989 --> 01:45:00.409
Make sure to chop it
straight into the heart.
