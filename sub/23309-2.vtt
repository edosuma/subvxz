WEBVTT

00:03.665 --> 00:05.698
Give us a call when you get there?

00:05.929 --> 00:07.496
Yep. I'll try.

00:07.498 --> 00:10.932
I'm heading right to the
conference from the airport.

00:10.934 --> 00:13.871
Then at least a text so
I know you got there.

00:14.238 --> 00:16.738
Will do. Hey, Jamie.

00:19.647 --> 00:22.114
- Be good for your mom, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

00:22.246 --> 00:23.962
Know what I was thinking?

00:23.968 --> 00:25.777
Maybe we see a ball
game when I get back?

00:25.783 --> 00:27.249
Yeah, yeah.

00:32.226 --> 00:34.526
- I'll see you in a few days.
- Okay.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.545 --> 00:56.845
Nice family you got there.

00:56.914 --> 00:58.180
Thanks.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.519
You know they're gonna
find out eventually.

01:04.587 --> 01:05.721
Yeah.

01:09.259 --> 01:10.625
But not today.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.572
Kilroy, right?

01:23.640 --> 01:24.960
Yep.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.118
You got your computer set up.

01:27.124 --> 01:28.377
Computer?

01:28.383 --> 01:30.355
A computer's something
you pick up at Best Buy.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.082
This rig packs ten times the
processing power of anything

01:33.088 --> 01:34.898
available on the consumer market,

01:34.904 --> 01:38.529
running an adaptive data mining
algorithm being fed 24/7

01:38.535 --> 01:41.736
by all of Big Brother's
intelligence feeds.

01:41.931 --> 01:44.621
- It comes with a mouse, too.
- It does come with a...

01:45.472 --> 01:46.704
Please don't.

01:50.714 --> 01:52.581
What's going on in here?

01:52.587 --> 01:54.762
Setting up a Fort Bragg
outlet store or something?

01:54.768 --> 01:56.057
Tools of the trade.

01:56.063 --> 01:57.924
Gotta be ready to give
something to get something.

01:57.930 --> 01:59.417
Subtle.

01:59.486 --> 02:00.969
Sort of like the missile that you

02:00.975 --> 02:02.458
brought to the party in Mexico.

02:02.464 --> 02:04.197
Saved your ass, didn't it?

02:04.203 --> 02:06.503
You'll find I'm not a
fan of half measures.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.192
Go big or go home, huh?

02:08.261 --> 02:10.728
More like go big so you
can go home. Excuse me.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.133
Looks like you've
settled in. That's good.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.534
'Cause we have a job.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.470
This is Paul Graham.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.372
He's a professor of Middle East studies

02:21.441 --> 02:23.474
at Corwin University in Ohio.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.443
Currently he's in Federal custody.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.773
What'd he do?

02:26.779 --> 02:28.346
Director Casey wouldn't elaborate.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.759
He said it's a need-to-know,

02:29.765 --> 02:31.482
and not relevant to our assignment.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.051
What is our assignment?

02:33.119 --> 02:34.652
Graham is scheduled to be transported

02:34.658 --> 02:36.025
to a Federal courthouse in D.C.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.331
We're going to ensure he gets there.

02:37.337 --> 02:40.087
I thought babysitting prisoners
was the marshal's job.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.027
Well, we do have a little experience.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.243
Oh, that is hysterical.
That's really very funny.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.350
Apparently the Director wants
to safeguard against any

02:48.418 --> 02:50.285
potential threats from
within or without.

02:50.354 --> 02:52.539
Okay. What's the play?

02:53.434 --> 02:54.744
The transition points are where

02:54.750 --> 02:56.312
Graham will be the most vulnerable.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.786
So, Mills, you'll take the first point

02:57.792 --> 02:59.205
in Ohio where Graham's trip begins.

02:59.269 --> 03:01.966
Santana, you'll recon the
arrival airport in D.C.

03:01.972 --> 03:03.739
Upon landing, the two of you will

03:03.808 --> 03:05.874
shadow the detail for the
final leg to the courthouse.

03:05.943 --> 03:08.530
Kilroy has your covers.
You can learn them on the way.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.903
Any questions? Great.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.549
Mills, a minute?

03:15.345 --> 03:17.653
I just wanted to check in with you.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.260
Okay. Why?

03:21.392 --> 03:24.821
You've endured an extended
traumatic experience.

03:25.296 --> 03:27.229
How are you readjusting?

03:27.235 --> 03:28.730
I'm fine.

03:28.736 --> 03:31.036
For the most part.

03:31.802 --> 03:33.802
There's nothing you need
to be worried about.

03:34.151 --> 03:35.984
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

03:39.066 --> 03:41.109
Well, it's my folks.

03:41.178 --> 03:43.545
I haven't told them I'm back yet.

03:43.551 --> 03:45.051
Why not?

03:45.442 --> 03:48.614
They've been through
so much this past year.

03:49.169 --> 03:51.716
Losing my sister.

03:52.456 --> 03:54.423
I just didn't want them
to worry about me.

03:54.491 --> 03:56.558
You've been gone six months.

03:56.564 --> 03:58.260
I'm not sure...

03:58.266 --> 04:00.266
Reconnecting with them...

04:01.645 --> 04:03.678
I mean, if something
should happen to me...

04:03.684 --> 04:05.411
You're protecting them.

04:06.103 --> 04:09.209
By staying out of sight,
you're staying out of mind.

04:09.522 --> 04:11.055
I don't know, maybe.

04:11.061 --> 04:14.172
Well, it's your business.

04:14.178 --> 04:16.245
But I'd suggest you think it over.

04:16.313 --> 04:18.714
Consider who it is
you're really protecting.

04:21.084 --> 04:23.085
Well, you'd better get going.

04:23.153 --> 04:24.686
Got a flight to catch.

04:30.794 --> 04:33.544
Yeah?

04:33.551 --> 04:35.597
They're headed your way.
You have your cover down?

04:35.603 --> 04:37.473
Deputy Burke is in position.

04:37.479 --> 04:38.687
They're here.

04:38.826 --> 04:40.459
And you're on.

04:45.736 --> 04:48.874
- Burke, out of D.C.
- D.C.?

04:49.374 --> 04:52.042
Thought I knew all the
deputies in that office.

04:52.048 --> 04:53.553
Oh.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.662
I transferred in last
month under Deputy Vega.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.531
I know Vega.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.467
He still bringing that mean
mutt of his into the office?

05:01.536 --> 05:03.202
What was his name again?

05:06.908 --> 05:09.475
The mutt's name is Sarge.
Got neutered a month ago.

05:09.544 --> 05:11.010
Sarge.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.670
Yeah, he's mellowed out a little

05:12.676 --> 05:14.118
since Vega got him snipped.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.449
Well, that'd do it.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.340
Saddle up.

05:35.965 --> 05:37.024
Hey.

05:37.799 --> 05:39.112
Relax.

05:40.184 --> 05:41.400
I hate flying.

05:41.582 --> 05:43.541
Just watch the pilots.

05:44.321 --> 05:46.512
If they're relaxed, you can be too.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.190
What is that?

06:07.295 --> 06:08.597
_

06:09.837 --> 06:11.604
What? It's gone.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.639
- What is?
- The plane.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.048
We've got a flame out.
The electrical system's down.

06:16.054 --> 06:17.197
The battery isn't kicking in.

06:17.203 --> 06:19.269
Electromagnetic pulse just fried it.

06:19.275 --> 06:20.616
You gotta find us a clearing.

06:20.622 --> 06:22.422
A clearing? Where?

06:22.428 --> 06:25.329
- We've got no hydraulics.
- What's happening?

06:25.452 --> 06:27.085
Are they relaxed? They
don't look so relaxed.

06:27.099 --> 06:29.165
- Get to the back of the plane.
- What's going on?

06:29.171 --> 06:30.971
Just sit down and strap in.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.830
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

06:33.836 --> 06:36.132
The back of the plane is the
safest place to be in a crash.

06:36.138 --> 06:37.598
Crash? Did you say crash?

06:37.604 --> 06:39.453
Just forget about the
pilots and listen to me.

06:39.459 --> 06:41.170
This plane is going down.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.161
And if you wanna survive,
you do what I tell you.

06:43.229 --> 06:45.096
Now when we hit, the fuel could ignite,

06:45.102 --> 06:47.077
so you need to get away
from the plane if you can.

06:49.102 --> 06:50.334
Get into your brace position.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.980
Feet flat, head down. And remember...

06:53.797 --> 06:55.564
Breathe.

06:55.632 --> 06:56.665
Oh, God.

06:59.612 --> 07:01.779
You're gonna have to deadstick it.

07:01.785 --> 07:03.785
Keep the wings level.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.090
Hold on!

07:30.434 --> 07:32.268
Graham!

07:40.694 --> 07:42.126
Easy now.

07:49.115 --> 07:50.180
Bryan.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.136
Bryan!

07:53.273 --> 07:56.325
Bryan. Why do we look for a river?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.982
To get water.

07:57.988 --> 08:00.159
Yes, but only after you filter it.

08:00.165 --> 08:02.866
A river can also lead
you to civilization.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.582
What direction are we traveling in?

08:04.588 --> 08:05.899
- I don't know.
- North?

08:05.905 --> 08:08.123
West. Sun's on our left.

08:08.233 --> 08:10.066
Dad, why do we have to do this?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.657
Because you need to know
what it's like out here.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.553
What it takes to survive.

08:14.675 --> 08:16.008
You need to use your senses,

08:16.014 --> 08:17.347
your instinct, your mind.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.165
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.889
I meant to miss.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.258
Son, there's gonna come
a point in your life

08:47.327 --> 08:49.925
when the only person you
can rely on is yourself.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.862
I need to know you're gonna be okay.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.731
Do you understand?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.336
Go get the arrow.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.521
Graham!

09:21.428 --> 09:23.027
I don't care where he is.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.963
I need the Director to call me ASAP.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.199
- Any signal on the plane?
- Nothing.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.293
Nothing from the transponder.
Nothing from Mills' phone.

09:30.307 --> 09:32.830
I checked with the FAA;
no distress signals came in.

09:32.836 --> 09:35.310
- It's like they just disappeared.
- Well, they didn't.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.309
Probably just set down over
northern West Virginia.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.978
Unless, of course, there was a bomb.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.948
I'm sure that... I mean,
I'm sure it wasn't a bomb.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.550
I'll... I'll keep... I'll keep digging.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.585
Okay, I need... I need more
information on Graham.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.487
I want you to dig up everything you can.

09:49.493 --> 09:50.684
- All right.
- And coordinate with Santana.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.019
She's on her way to the area.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.558
Yeah.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.132
It's serious "Deliverance"
country out here, man.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.635
Actually, that was Georgia. Technically.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.104
Uh, okay, so you're about 40 miles east

10:06.172 --> 10:07.605
of where we lost contact.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.908
I can barely see 40
feet into these woods.

10:09.914 --> 10:11.308
Might have better luck asking

10:11.314 --> 10:13.149
the locals if they've seen anything.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.079
Assuming anyone lives out here.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.415
Okay, just be wary of banjos.

10:28.383 --> 10:29.949
Easy!

10:29.955 --> 10:32.088
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Get back!

10:32.095 --> 10:34.996
Easy. You're in shock.

10:35.402 --> 10:39.003
Stay calm. Calm.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.445
What happened to the plane?

10:50.216 --> 10:52.717
We were taken down by a drone.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.221
We're the only survivors.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.559
Taken down?

11:02.611 --> 11:04.377
So they did find out.

11:04.453 --> 11:06.587
Who are they?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.534
I think they just showed up.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.783
Okay, I went complete stalker on

11:16.789 --> 11:18.147
Graham, and this is what I found.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.640
He's totally clean, he's been a tenured

11:19.646 --> 11:21.375
university professor for
the last three years.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.210
Got no money problems,
aside from the fact

11:23.216 --> 11:25.226
that he spends what he
makes, like most of America.

11:25.232 --> 11:26.531
No criminal record.

11:26.537 --> 11:29.241
- So nothing we didn't already know.
- Yeah, but then I had Hojna

11:29.247 --> 11:30.397
cross reference every government

11:30.403 --> 11:31.979
database and I found this.

11:32.635 --> 11:35.502
- He's got an FBI file?
- An L5-Confidential file.

11:35.626 --> 11:37.559
Can you get past their firewall?

11:37.565 --> 11:40.080
Well, yeah. I mean, "can" isn't
really the issue. It's just more

11:40.086 --> 11:42.594
a matter of leaving a trace which
would lead back here probably.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.500
Do it. I'll deal with the blowback.

11:44.568 --> 11:45.834
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:51.475 --> 11:52.741
What's he doing?

11:52.810 --> 11:55.644
Waiting. For us to make a mistake.

12:30.548 --> 12:32.590
The barrel's wrecked.

12:39.023 --> 12:40.722
No ID.

12:40.728 --> 12:42.795
But judging by the Kevlar,
hardware, and training,

12:42.801 --> 12:44.300
I'd say he was a soldier.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.439
Maybe special forces.

12:46.697 --> 12:48.254
His name's McNeil.

12:50.768 --> 12:52.362
You know this guy?

12:55.039 --> 12:57.909
I think it's about time you
tell me who the hell you are.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.278
We're in.

13:01.545 --> 13:03.745
Before lecturing on the Middle East,

13:03.751 --> 13:07.319
he was serving in it as a
private military contractor.

13:07.325 --> 13:09.769
The professor was a mercenary?

13:09.775 --> 13:12.075
Looks like he was part of a team.

13:12.823 --> 13:16.711
He was part of a PMC
team I was on in Iraq.

13:17.471 --> 13:20.072
I was a geographical analyst.

13:20.297 --> 13:22.297
I saw some bad things go down.

13:22.303 --> 13:23.669
Yeah? How bad?

13:23.801 --> 13:25.634
Doesn't get much worse.

13:25.703 --> 13:28.125
That's why I was headed to D.C.

13:28.712 --> 13:30.345
To tell them what I saw.

13:30.414 --> 13:32.766
So you aren't just a prisoner?

13:33.317 --> 13:34.516
You're a witness.

13:34.585 --> 13:36.785
Against your former team.

13:39.356 --> 13:41.256
How many more men were on that team?

13:41.562 --> 13:42.758
Three.

13:42.827 --> 13:44.113
If this guy found us, it means

13:44.119 --> 13:45.532
the others can't be far behind.

13:45.596 --> 13:46.795
Move.

14:07.251 --> 14:08.857
Dad?

14:09.601 --> 14:11.501
Dad, where are you?

14:30.205 --> 14:31.986
We're lost.

14:32.588 --> 14:34.321
Any idea where we're heading?

14:37.212 --> 14:38.712
West.

14:39.381 --> 14:41.381
Figured a geographer would know that.

14:41.998 --> 14:44.098
I'm a cultural geographer.

14:44.215 --> 14:46.252
Helped identify and navigate tribes

14:46.258 --> 14:47.791
in the Iraqi countryside.

14:47.923 --> 14:50.757
- Dangerous work environment.
- Pay's good, though.

14:50.826 --> 14:52.359
What did the wife think of the job?

14:53.599 --> 14:56.533
She didn't. If I'd told her,
she'd never let me go.

14:56.539 --> 14:58.739
Gotta love the irony.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.133
So what happened?

15:02.838 --> 15:04.671
It was during the Iraqi Civil War.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.937
We were there providing
security for local villages.

15:07.943 --> 15:11.378
And most of the PMCs I
worked with were good men.

15:11.473 --> 15:13.272
You're saying "most."

15:13.358 --> 15:15.299
Some people were there for

15:15.557 --> 15:17.845
less honorable reasons.

15:18.096 --> 15:19.896
The last team I was on...

15:21.600 --> 15:25.235
We went out to this liberated village,

15:25.303 --> 15:27.203
they swept it.

15:27.272 --> 15:29.539
Didn't find any insurgents,
but they found a chest

15:29.608 --> 15:31.074
full of American money.

15:31.143 --> 15:33.877
One of Saddam's hidden cash stashes.

15:33.945 --> 15:36.399
Our team leader, Hicks,

15:37.109 --> 15:38.849
decided to keep it.

15:39.117 --> 15:42.370
When we were leaving, an Iraqi boy,

15:43.021 --> 15:46.398
about 12 or 13, saw us.

15:47.292 --> 15:50.560
And Hicks told him to get lost,
but the boy didn't move.

15:52.464 --> 15:55.231
Other villagers came. Started yelling.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.254
Hicks got fed up and just...

15:58.303 --> 16:00.069
Opened fire.

16:00.138 --> 16:01.748
Then all hell broke loose,

16:01.754 --> 16:03.611
and by the time it was done,

16:04.036 --> 16:08.278
the boy and 18 villagers were dead.

16:08.346 --> 16:11.410
Hicks and his team then warned
me not to say anything.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.884
Said if I did, they'd come
after me and my family.

16:16.551 --> 16:18.517
Oh, my God. My family!

16:18.523 --> 16:20.323
They're not going after them.

16:20.392 --> 16:22.753
They're coming after you. Come on.

16:23.995 --> 16:25.595
Turns out Graham was on his way to D.C.

16:25.664 --> 16:28.932
to testify in a joint
US-Iraqi investigation

16:29.000 --> 16:31.659
into the killing of
some Iraqi civilians.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.330
- Where'd you get this?
- The Director.

16:35.336 --> 16:36.702
I told him I needed to know.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.975
- What's the status of the plane?
- Nothing yet.

16:38.981 --> 16:40.745
But the weird part is, is that I've been

16:40.751 --> 16:42.508
monitoring wireless towers in the area

16:42.514 --> 16:44.546
for any signal from
devices on the plane.

16:44.552 --> 16:47.046
- Phones, tablets, transponders.
- Find anything?

16:47.052 --> 16:48.318
No, not a blip.

16:48.386 --> 16:49.986
How's that possible?

16:50.055 --> 16:51.487
It's not, unless the plane disappeared

16:51.556 --> 16:53.289
into some previously undiscovered lake,

16:53.358 --> 16:55.058
or something knocked
out its electronics.

16:55.126 --> 16:56.661
What, do you mean like an EMP?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.361
I mean, the tech exists.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.415
That means someone took the plane down.

17:00.421 --> 17:02.732
Stay on it. I'm gonna see if
I can get more information

17:02.801 --> 17:04.968
about this team Graham was a part of.

17:08.983 --> 17:11.473
- Christina.
- David.

17:11.606 --> 17:13.439
It's nice to finally put a
face to the reputation.

17:13.444 --> 17:14.858
Likewise. Thank you for meeting

17:14.865 --> 17:16.050
me on such short notice.

17:16.056 --> 17:17.576
One of the perks of
owning the company...

17:17.582 --> 17:19.582
I get to leave when I want.

17:19.651 --> 17:21.651
So is this about your new shake-up?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.685
Word travels fast.

17:23.755 --> 17:26.489
The military contracting
community's a small world.

17:26.558 --> 17:28.658
- Welcome to it.
- Thank you.

17:31.902 --> 17:33.428
So how can I help?

17:33.435 --> 17:35.307
I'm looking for information on a man who

17:35.313 --> 17:37.464
worked for you a few
years ago. Paul Graham.

17:38.603 --> 17:41.070
I can't say I remember,
but I've used a lot

17:41.076 --> 17:43.510
of contractors over the years.
What about him?

17:43.642 --> 17:45.174
Well, he was on his way to testify

17:45.180 --> 17:46.560
in an investigation;

17:46.566 --> 17:48.745
a massacre of Iraqi civilians.

17:54.452 --> 17:56.286
- He was involved in this?
- Apparently.

17:56.354 --> 17:58.054
Along with the rest of his PMC team.

17:58.123 --> 18:01.224
But the plane carrying him disappeared.

18:01.293 --> 18:03.526
With my man on board.

18:03.595 --> 18:05.528
Damn. I'm sorry to hear it.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.066
This is the rest of his team.

18:10.135 --> 18:11.534
Do you recognize any of them?

18:18.610 --> 18:20.209
- This guy.
- Hicks?

18:20.278 --> 18:21.477
What do you know about him?

18:21.546 --> 18:23.771
Yeah, I used him a couple times.

18:24.903 --> 18:27.070
He was a bad apple. Unreliable.

18:27.076 --> 18:29.710
And he had a few scrapes
with the local Iraqi police.

18:29.779 --> 18:31.879
Kind of guy who gives
contractors a bad name.

18:31.948 --> 18:33.548
Should have never hired him.

18:33.554 --> 18:34.843
Do you think Hicks would go so

18:34.849 --> 18:36.484
far as to take down a plane?

18:37.388 --> 18:40.756
If it was carrying a guy who
could put him away for murder,

18:40.825 --> 18:42.758
I wouldn't put it past him.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.553
Wait, wh... Why go this way?

18:56.559 --> 18:57.773
That river.

18:57.981 --> 19:00.581
If we follow it, it'll
lead us somewhere.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.817
Okay, but how do we get down this?

19:02.886 --> 19:04.631
Carefully.

19:05.055 --> 19:06.354
Take a hold of my arm.

19:08.658 --> 19:11.017
Small steps. Hey!

19:11.023 --> 19:13.528
Heel first. And keep your weight back.

19:13.596 --> 19:15.237
And don't cross your feet.

19:28.878 --> 19:30.511
Whoa!

19:44.389 --> 19:45.722
Graham!

19:51.520 --> 19:52.796
Are you all right?

19:52.798 --> 19:54.184
My leg.

19:55.973 --> 19:57.473
I think it's broken.

20:00.172 --> 20:02.606
Come on. I got you.

20:34.309 --> 20:36.699
Hey. Just fireworks, huh?

20:37.827 --> 20:39.227
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:39.233 --> 20:41.181
- Stop right there.
- Easy, easy.

20:41.249 --> 20:43.053
I thought I heard gunfire.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.151
What do you want?

20:45.220 --> 20:46.419
I'm looking for a plane

20:46.488 --> 20:48.284
that might have gone
down in these woods.

20:48.604 --> 20:51.004
- Have you seen anybody?
- Just you.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.107
Ain't nobody out here but us.

20:54.896 --> 20:55.995
How about you?

20:56.064 --> 20:57.459
Did you see anybody?

20:57.465 --> 21:00.633
Just some hunters when
I was out shooting squirrels.

21:00.702 --> 21:02.769
Hunters? How many?

21:02.838 --> 21:04.704
- Three.
- What'd they look like?

21:04.773 --> 21:06.539
I guess kind of like soldiers,

21:06.608 --> 21:08.187
what with their gear and all.

21:08.461 --> 21:10.149
- Did they say what they were hunting?
- Nope.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.236
They were headed into the wildwood.

21:12.242 --> 21:13.374
Wildwood?

21:13.405 --> 21:14.922
Deepest part of the woods.

21:14.978 --> 21:16.439
Nobody goes in there.

21:16.445 --> 21:18.646
Too easy to get lost
and never make it out.

21:20.984 --> 21:23.251
- Disappeared?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Graham.

21:23.319 --> 21:24.878
Oh, my God.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.885
We are actively searching for

21:26.891 --> 21:28.961
the plane and any survivors.

21:29.025 --> 21:30.758
Did Paul tell you where he was going?

21:30.827 --> 21:33.094
To an education conference in Boston.

21:33.162 --> 21:34.929
He wasn't going to Boston.

21:34.998 --> 21:36.945
He was on his way to Washington D.C.

21:36.951 --> 21:39.218
to testify in an investigation.

21:39.435 --> 21:41.569
I don't know why I'm surprised.

21:41.638 --> 21:43.004
The way he's been lately,

21:43.072 --> 21:44.401
he's just grown more isolated.

21:44.407 --> 21:45.573
He hasn't been sleeping.

21:45.579 --> 21:48.346
He lashes out at me and our son.

21:48.478 --> 21:50.878
Did he ever talk to you
about his time in Iraq

21:50.884 --> 21:52.517
as a military contractor?

21:52.649 --> 21:54.548
Paul's never been to Iraq.

21:57.253 --> 21:58.319
I see.

22:00.089 --> 22:03.090
You apparently know more
about my husband than I do.

22:03.159 --> 22:04.925
I'm sorry.

22:04.994 --> 22:08.029
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

22:08.097 --> 22:11.532
Any strange phone calls or occurrences?

22:11.601 --> 22:15.371
There was a man in a car on our street.

22:16.372 --> 22:17.838
Was this the man?

22:17.844 --> 22:19.645
No, I'm pretty sure he was white.

22:21.848 --> 22:24.048
Thank you, Mrs. Graham.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.910
Wait.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.879
- What is this about?
- I'm sorry, I can't discuss it.

22:28.885 --> 22:31.118
Are you married, Miss Hart?

22:34.027 --> 22:35.245
No.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.818
Well, if you were, you'd understand.

22:38.861 --> 22:40.895
The worst part of this
is the not knowing.

22:40.963 --> 22:42.851
I may not be married,

22:42.857 --> 22:45.143
but I do understand.

22:45.286 --> 22:47.243
Someone important to me was also on

22:47.249 --> 22:49.141
that plane, and I can tell you this.

22:49.205 --> 22:51.806
If they're still alive,
there is no better person

22:51.812 --> 22:54.333
for your husband to be with right now.

23:13.998 --> 23:16.197
You're not gonna get far on
that leg without a splint.

23:16.265 --> 23:18.332
It doesn't matter.

23:18.338 --> 23:20.371
I'm not getting out of this alive.

23:20.503 --> 23:22.625
Not with that attitude, you won't.

23:35.084 --> 23:37.184
I took the money.

23:39.155 --> 23:40.553
What?

23:40.559 --> 23:43.127
After we got back to the village,

23:43.208 --> 23:45.428
Hicks told me

23:45.662 --> 23:48.482
not to talk or he'd come
after me and my family.

23:50.508 --> 23:52.429
And then he offered me the money.

23:53.812 --> 23:55.078
How much?

23:56.615 --> 23:58.014
$50,000.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.683
It was blood money.
I should have refused,

24:00.752 --> 24:02.051
but I needed it.

24:04.656 --> 24:07.112
Not a day went by that
I didn't regret it.

24:08.493 --> 24:10.526
Every time I looked at my son,

24:10.595 --> 24:12.868
I would see that boy that Hicks killed.

24:13.798 --> 24:16.065
I couldn't tell him what happened.

24:16.478 --> 24:18.962
I got to the point where I
couldn't tell him anything.

24:21.606 --> 24:24.293
Not that he would have heard me, anyway.

24:24.876 --> 24:27.347
I thought that by testifying, I...

24:30.015 --> 24:31.581
I could start to make things right

24:31.650 --> 24:33.679
for those people who died,

24:34.121 --> 24:35.759
and for my family.

24:37.922 --> 24:40.323
But all I did is get more people killed.

24:43.295 --> 24:45.045
It's probably better this way.

24:46.469 --> 24:48.402
At least my son won't know what I did.

24:49.713 --> 24:51.193
No.

24:52.904 --> 24:54.637
He has to know.

24:54.706 --> 24:57.492
And you have to be around
to help him understand

24:57.498 --> 24:59.092
that you don't give up.

25:01.027 --> 25:03.961
Even when things seem
hopeless, you see it through.

25:06.227 --> 25:08.132
And he'll be stronger for it someday.

25:08.138 --> 25:09.637
You can trust me on that.

25:11.304 --> 25:12.870
A son needs his father.

25:17.814 --> 25:19.709
And you need him.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.691
Well, even if you're right,

25:29.697 --> 25:31.956
we're outnumbered and outgunned.

25:32.024 --> 25:33.853
We haven't been outsmarted.

25:46.472 --> 25:47.772
You stay here.

25:49.308 --> 25:51.208
Well, if I stay here, they'll find me.

25:51.277 --> 25:52.876
I'm counting on it.

27:26.238 --> 27:27.671
Greetings, friend.

27:31.444 --> 27:33.510
What brings you out to these parts?

27:33.579 --> 27:35.079
Just hiking.

27:35.085 --> 27:37.019
Well, dangerous country
to be hiking alone.

27:37.025 --> 27:38.758
Tell me about it.

27:38.779 --> 27:40.879
I'll be sure to bring a buddy next time.

27:45.161 --> 27:47.895
Pretty sure you already
got one of those.

27:47.901 --> 27:49.934
Paul Graham.

27:50.129 --> 27:51.362
Who?

27:57.903 --> 28:01.142
Now, I am gonna find
Graham sooner or later.

28:02.842 --> 28:04.399
Only question is whether you give

28:04.405 --> 28:05.914
me a reason to keep you alive.

28:12.238 --> 28:14.039
So who you working for?

28:14.653 --> 28:16.453
'Cause you sure as
hell ain't no marshal.

28:17.163 --> 28:20.097
The way you got over on
McNeil, I'm guessing SpecOps.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.467
I figured.

28:23.848 --> 28:25.414
It's like they say,

28:25.483 --> 28:26.982
talent recognizes talent.

28:27.114 --> 28:29.481
All I recognize is a man
who sells his talent

28:29.487 --> 28:31.920
- to the highest bidder.
- More than that.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.456
I provide security in an insecure world.

28:34.804 --> 28:37.246
By security, you mean the
killing of innocent civilians

28:38.028 --> 28:39.652
and U.S. citizens?

28:40.651 --> 28:42.383
I won't be a part of it.

28:43.479 --> 28:45.291
I'm not going any further.

28:47.338 --> 28:49.271
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

29:00.518 --> 29:02.718
Go!

29:43.928 --> 29:45.561
Drop it!

29:47.965 --> 29:49.656
I won't ask again.

29:53.971 --> 29:56.087
You don't have to do this.

29:56.473 --> 29:58.732
You know, Graham was just
trying to do the right thing.

29:58.738 --> 30:01.009
No, the right thing
would have been for him

30:01.015 --> 30:03.449
to take the money and
keep his mouth shut.

30:03.581 --> 30:04.880
Move.

30:17.628 --> 30:18.894
Now!

30:24.034 --> 30:25.133
Kill it!

30:40.206 --> 30:41.596
It worked.

30:41.602 --> 30:42.692
For now.

30:55.303 --> 30:58.237
Saw this wildlife camera had a sim chip.

30:58.306 --> 31:00.506
That means it can be accessed remotely

31:00.575 --> 31:02.041
over a wireless network.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.777
If I can just power it up,
it may be able to send

31:04.846 --> 31:07.255
a digital distress call.

31:07.475 --> 31:08.875
To who?

31:09.117 --> 31:12.852
Some friends who are
hopefully looking for us.

31:20.401 --> 31:21.901
Well, hello.

31:23.878 --> 31:26.261
- Yeah?
- I may have found something here.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.173
There's a signal pinging a cell tower

31:28.179 --> 31:30.289
out there in a really specific pattern.

31:30.295 --> 31:32.367
If I remember my Morse,
I think it's an S.O.S. call.

31:32.373 --> 31:34.229
Well, that's gotta be Mills. Where?

31:34.235 --> 31:36.481
Well, the tower's near you,
but there's a five-mile

31:36.487 --> 31:38.473
radius where the signal
could be coming from.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.572
Needle in a slightly smaller haystack.

31:40.578 --> 31:42.687
There's gotta be some
way to get to them.

31:44.023 --> 31:45.396
Maybe instead of us trying to find

31:45.402 --> 31:46.728
Mills, we can help him find us.

31:50.204 --> 31:52.933
I swear to God, boy.

31:52.939 --> 31:54.098
Hey, boys.

31:54.167 --> 31:56.233
You again. Back with more questions?

31:56.239 --> 31:59.616
No, but I am gonna need
a couple things from you.

31:59.772 --> 32:01.746
Those fireworks, for starters.

32:02.384 --> 32:03.808
How about a trade?

32:05.816 --> 32:07.080
With those, you'll see anyone

32:07.086 --> 32:08.619
within 1,000 feet of your property.

32:08.645 --> 32:10.672
Not to mention every
squirrel in the county.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.278
Whoa. Yeah, okay.

32:12.284 --> 32:13.850
Yeah, but hang on,

32:13.856 --> 32:15.794
'cause I'm gonna need
something else too.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.066
What's that?

32:24.066 --> 32:25.996
I guess your signal didn't work.

32:26.002 --> 32:29.138
Don't know. We gotta keep moving.

32:33.739 --> 32:35.967
Who the hell's setting
off fireworks out here?

32:35.973 --> 32:37.436
I got a pretty good idea.

32:40.148 --> 32:42.182
Go big or go home.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.683
Time to go.

32:46.254 --> 32:47.458
Hicks!

32:47.464 --> 32:48.830
Over here!

32:48.836 --> 32:50.182
Cut me loose!

32:54.012 --> 32:55.595
They couldn't have gotten far.

32:55.601 --> 32:57.090
Gimme that.

33:10.508 --> 33:12.173
We have to keep going.

33:14.622 --> 33:16.387
I can't.

33:41.678 --> 33:43.082
That's enough, Bryan.

33:54.045 --> 33:56.310
It's okay. You're okay.

33:57.647 --> 33:59.013
You did it.

34:03.253 --> 34:04.751
Did it?

34:05.259 --> 34:08.060
You left me out here alone?

34:08.324 --> 34:10.257
You were never alone.

34:10.326 --> 34:13.402
Okay. I needed to know
that you could do it.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.996
Do what you had to do

34:15.315 --> 34:16.784
to survive.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.355
More importantly, you needed
to know you could do it.

34:20.879 --> 34:22.212
And you did.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.739
I'm proud of you.

34:28.496 --> 34:29.744
Let's go home, son.

34:37.687 --> 34:39.444
Listen to me.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.322
You are stronger than you know.

34:43.059 --> 34:45.877
Do you wanna see your
family again or not?

35:17.647 --> 35:20.215
- We made it.
- Not yet, we haven't.

35:20.283 --> 35:21.783
Look out!

35:22.140 --> 35:23.272
Get down!

35:27.439 --> 35:28.765
Need a ride?

35:30.211 --> 35:31.336
Let's go!

35:32.165 --> 35:34.065
Get in.

35:34.134 --> 35:35.333
It's Hicks!

35:46.780 --> 35:48.975
You got anything stronger
than a skyrocket?

35:57.424 --> 35:58.665
Go!

36:17.878 --> 36:20.778
I should have told you
everything, sweetheart.

36:20.847 --> 36:23.399
And I will. I promise.

36:25.157 --> 36:26.437
Is Jamie there?

36:30.257 --> 36:31.456
Hey, buddy.

36:33.493 --> 36:34.989
No, no, it's just...

36:36.396 --> 36:38.162
It's just really good
to hear your voice.

36:44.181 --> 36:46.839
Thanks for being the search party.

36:47.215 --> 36:49.649
You tell the boss about
Hicks and his boys?

36:49.921 --> 36:51.504
Yeah.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.219
She put a call into the FBI.

36:55.181 --> 36:56.681
They'll track them down.

36:59.719 --> 37:01.920
How'd you know it was me? The fireworks?

37:03.546 --> 37:05.823
I figured a flare would
have been too subtle.

37:08.762 --> 37:10.506
No half measures, right?

37:10.512 --> 37:12.946
You're damn straight.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.454
Do we have orders?

37:38.925 --> 37:41.865
- Sir.
- I heard you hit a snag.

37:41.871 --> 37:43.094
He had an operator with him.

37:43.163 --> 37:44.395
It's okay.

37:44.420 --> 37:46.698
It happens. Sometimes
missions go sideways.

37:46.766 --> 37:49.563
It just means we have
to adapt and overcome.

37:49.740 --> 37:50.946
Yes, sir.

37:51.525 --> 37:52.919
But not for you.

37:53.248 --> 37:55.078
You're relieved of duty.

38:16.162 --> 38:18.129
I heard Graham survived the crash

38:18.198 --> 38:20.164
and an attempt on his life.

38:20.233 --> 38:22.233
No doubt thanks to your man.

38:22.302 --> 38:24.068
Must be a hell of an operator.

38:24.074 --> 38:25.284
He is.

38:25.665 --> 38:27.565
I'd like to meet him someday.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.108
You might.

38:32.245 --> 38:34.055
I also assume you heard that Hicks and

38:34.061 --> 38:35.918
the rest of his team were found dead.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.448
Your man's handiwork?

38:37.454 --> 38:38.550
No.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.093
Unlike some, I don't employ murderers.

38:45.492 --> 38:47.725
Someone had been
watching Graham's house.

38:47.794 --> 38:48.960
I thought it was Hicks.

38:49.029 --> 38:51.195
Turned out to be a guy named Morris.

38:51.264 --> 38:53.464
That same car passed through
a West Virginia toll booth

38:53.533 --> 38:55.900
the same night Hicks and
his men were killed.

38:55.969 --> 38:58.569
I'm not sure why you think
this is relevant to me.

38:58.638 --> 39:00.331
Maybe because you and Morris

39:00.337 --> 39:02.211
were on the same Ranger squad

39:02.275 --> 39:03.601
years ago, and we both know

39:03.607 --> 39:05.128
how tight those teams can be.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.113
When Hicks' team killed
those civilians, they were

39:09.119 --> 39:11.712
under a Black Falls contract...
Your company.

39:11.718 --> 39:14.018
I'm guessing you found
out about the massacre

39:14.087 --> 39:15.553
and had Hicks cover
it up just to protect

39:15.622 --> 39:17.021
Black Falls' bottom line,

39:17.090 --> 39:20.103
but then Graham decided to talk.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.293
So you sent Hicks to silence him.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.936
And after that failed,
Morris to silence Hicks.

39:25.432 --> 39:26.683
Because if everybody who could

39:26.689 --> 39:28.142
tie you to the cover up was dead,

39:28.148 --> 39:30.940
then no one can be flipped
to testify against you.

39:36.009 --> 39:39.651
You know you're not part
of the government anymore.

39:40.505 --> 39:42.338
You're in my world now.

39:42.369 --> 39:45.878
And out here, the rules are different.

39:46.525 --> 39:50.461
I'd really prefer if we could
remain friendly competitors.

39:56.663 --> 39:58.596
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

40:01.801 --> 40:03.534
So he just gets to walk away?

40:05.004 --> 40:06.537
This time.

40:06.606 --> 40:08.506
What about Graham's testimony?

40:08.575 --> 40:10.241
It's not enough. Without Hicks,

40:10.247 --> 40:12.847
Ramsey has plausible deniability.

40:12.979 --> 40:15.536
- And Graham still goes to prison.
- Yes.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.748
But with a reduced
sentence for cooperating.

40:18.088 --> 40:19.484
He'll be all right.

40:21.621 --> 40:23.454
His family will get him through it.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.257
Speaking of which, have you given any

40:25.263 --> 40:26.963
thought about what to tell yours?

40:26.969 --> 40:28.424
I haven't had much of a chance.

40:28.430 --> 40:31.395
Well, whatever you decide,

40:31.464 --> 40:34.032
know that our jobs will
always involve risk.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.699
But pushing people away doesn't

40:36.705 --> 40:38.474
always help protect them.

40:38.538 --> 40:41.072
Ultimately, it just leaves you alone.

40:50.116 --> 40:51.315
Hello?

40:51.384 --> 40:52.507
Dad.

40:53.895 --> 40:55.086
Bryan.

40:58.258 --> 41:00.155
It's good to hear from you.

41:00.727 --> 41:03.132
I wanted to come to see
you and Mom, but, uh,

41:04.146 --> 41:06.107
my job has been...

41:07.901 --> 41:09.967
Yeah, I know.

41:11.809 --> 41:13.475
How are you?

41:13.481 --> 41:14.906
I'm okay.

41:15.241 --> 41:16.984
That's why I called.

41:18.011 --> 41:19.610
I wanted you to know.

41:20.985 --> 41:22.380
I'm okay, Dad.

41:24.659 --> 41:25.731
Thanks.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.486
Thanks, son.

41:34.327 --> 41:35.593
Talk to you soon.
