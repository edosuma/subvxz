WEBVTT

00:04.710 --> 00:10.011
normally i wouldn't waste my time meeting with
a college freshman groveling for an internship.

00:10.032 --> 00:11.415
well, thank you, miss kahn.

00:11.451 --> 00:12.355
bitterman !

00:12.857 --> 00:13.562
yeah, chief ?

00:13.597 --> 00:15.455
where's that piece on senator jennings ?

00:15.487 --> 00:16.802
i- i-i'm
typing it up.

00:16.826 --> 00:18.247
i don't see your fingers moving.

00:18.287 --> 00:21.422
20 minutes, or they'll be
twiddling over the want ads.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.735
of course, chief.

00:23.627 --> 00:24.649
where was i ?

00:24.684 --> 00:25.717
the internship.

00:25.753 --> 00:27.890
oh, right, right,
right. you didn't get it.

00:27.937 --> 00:28.559
what ?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.011
well, then...

00:31.328 --> 00:32.267
why am i here ?

00:32.290 --> 00:35.484
curiosity. it's the backbone
of any decent reporter.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.551
have you got backbone, sullivan ?

00:37.586 --> 00:38.368
yeah, i...

00:39.060 --> 00:42.442
you had a column here a couple
of years ago, didn't you ?

00:42.642 --> 00:43.980
when i was in high school.

00:44.203 --> 00:46.728
well, that is quite an accomplishment

00:46.944 --> 00:50.561
to have your own by-line when
you're practically still in diapers.

00:50.811 --> 00:54.111
i mean, a lot of reporters...
well, real reporters

00:54.157 --> 00:57.105
work for years struggling before
they can get that kind of a chance.

00:57.128 --> 00:59.970
i just wanted to meet the
kid that could pull that off.

01:00.178 --> 01:00.871
thanks.

01:01.024 --> 01:04.382
oh, well, don't thank
me. thank lionel luthor.

01:04.415 --> 01:10.826
he's the one who arm-twisted the old chief editor
into dropping your juvenile pablum into this paper.

01:11.436 --> 01:13.162
i didn't ask lionel to do that.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.567
well, you didn't say
"no" either, did you ?

01:15.861 --> 01:20.264
then you must have done something to
piss lionel off because he got you fired.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.389
i remember that day.

01:22.422 --> 01:23.878
i believe we had cake.

01:25.968 --> 01:29.737
miss kahn, i don't expect to be
given a column like last time.

01:30.759 --> 01:35.350
i'm willing to start from the bottom and work
my way up without any help or arm-twisting.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.839
all i want is the
opportunity to prove myself.

01:37.874 --> 01:39.800
being a part of this world,

01:39.976 --> 01:42.028
working at the daily planet, it's...

01:42.275 --> 01:43.954
it's always been my dream.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.831
well, we all have to wake up
sometime, don't we, sullivan ?

01:47.066 --> 01:49.565
by the way, we don't validate.

01:56.645 --> 01:58.310
you know what, miss kahn ?

01:59.649 --> 02:04.134
i know you may be editor in chief now,
but even you had to start somewhere,

02:04.193 --> 02:08.078
and i am not going to give up
until i get the same chance.

02:16.826 --> 02:19.442
i started by being a damn good reporter.

02:19.876 --> 02:21.004
you want a break ?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.057
bring me a story.

02:26.111 --> 02:31.064
<i>okay, let's stop for a second. in case you
can't tell, i was completely freaked out.</i>

02:31.275 --> 02:33.447
<i>pauline kahn had thrown
down the gauntlet.</i>

02:33.482 --> 02:36.970
<i>the woman had two pulitzers. i
had a high-school service plaque</i>

02:37.006 --> 02:40.082
<i>and absolutely no idea where my
big story was going to come from.</i>

02:40.399 --> 02:44.978
<i>little did i know that 10 city blocks
away, it was about to bite me in the ass...</i>

02:45.096 --> 02:47.985
<i>well, more like the neck,
but we'll get to that later.</i>

02:48.032 --> 02:50.791
<i>welcome to the tri-psi sorority house.</i>

02:50.932 --> 02:53.891
<i>i think that's greek for
"bimbos, bikinis, and beer."</i>

02:56.366 --> 02:59.607
pizza pizza, delivered
in 28 minutes, piping...

03:01.662 --> 03:02.472
...hot.

03:02.531 --> 03:05.912
oh, my god, we are so starving.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.484
mmm, let's eat in the jacuzzi.

03:43.043 --> 03:45.015
i, uh... i really should
be getting back to work.

03:45.051 --> 03:46.788
Yeah, I should be doing that.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.583
mnh-mnh. can't you stay

03:50.429 --> 03:52.248
just for a little bit ?

03:53.810 --> 03:56.734
well, maybe just for a minute.

03:57.685 --> 03:59.023
what about your pizza ?

03:59.716 --> 04:01.936
you taste so much better than pepperoni.

04:15.184 --> 04:16.382
No ! No !

04:17.004 --> 04:18.094
No !

04:18.634 --> 04:19.338
No !

04:24.011 --> 04:25.045
Thirst.

05:18.446 --> 05:19.852
telegram.

05:21.238 --> 05:21.801
hey.

05:21.895 --> 05:22.787
clark, hi.

05:23.903 --> 05:24.866
i just wanted to...

05:26.665 --> 05:29.096
come by and surprise
myself. what's all this ?

05:30.035 --> 05:32.607
this is me packing.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.219
packing for what ?

05:34.260 --> 05:35.188
for college.

05:36.168 --> 05:36.838
i, uh...

05:37.404 --> 05:39.307
i got late acceptance to met u.

05:39.342 --> 05:40.258
congratulations.

05:41.103 --> 05:43.181
why didn't you tell me
you applied to met u. ?

05:44.097 --> 05:46.023
because i didn't want
to get my hopes up.

05:46.234 --> 05:49.519
i applied so late i didn't
think i had any chance.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.809
with your grades, they'd
be crazy not to accept you.

05:53.441 --> 05:57.757
well, i got in just under the wire. there
aren't even any dorm rooms left anymore.

05:57.793 --> 05:58.779
where are you going to stay ?

05:58.802 --> 06:01.832
i can crash at chloe's, but
maybe i'll try a sorority.

06:02.454 --> 06:03.988
i know how it sounds, but

06:04.023 --> 06:08.121
it's the only housing near to campus
i have any shot of getting into.

06:10.305 --> 06:15.305
you know, central kansas university has
plenty of housing still available, and...

06:15.340 --> 06:17.770
...and they have you.

06:20.236 --> 06:23.374
but they don't have any of the
courses that i'm really interested in,

06:23.796 --> 06:25.311
especially astronomy.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.788
it's not going to be that bad.

06:28.129 --> 06:30.970
we'll talk to each other
on the phone all the time.

06:33.702 --> 06:35.240
don't worry.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.757
nothing's going to change between us.

06:49.051 --> 06:51.476
welcome to the most prestigious

06:51.511 --> 06:55.163
and exclusive sorority
at metropolis university.

06:55.198 --> 06:57.640
we are the richest.
we are the prettiest.

06:57.675 --> 06:59.734
we are the best.

07:00.237 --> 07:03.654
over the next few days, many
of you will leave disappointed.

07:03.830 --> 07:08.057
but if you're insanely
cool and very, very lucky,

07:08.092 --> 07:10.907
you might just be
chosen to be a tri-psi.

07:11.153 --> 07:12.797
and if that happens,

07:12.820 --> 07:14.464
it'll change your life...

07:16.190 --> 07:17.130
...forever.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.515
<i>meet buffy sanders,</i>

07:21.656 --> 07:24.451
<i>president of the tri-psi sorority.</i>

07:24.779 --> 07:27.609
<i>by the way, i changed the
names to protect the vapid.</i>

07:29.646 --> 07:31.525
in the final days

07:31.560 --> 07:33.333
of the roman empire,

07:34.014 --> 07:35.094
wealth

07:35.599 --> 07:37.091
and power

07:37.912 --> 07:40.246
were the only things
the emperor coveted.

07:40.775 --> 07:43.029
what about the good citizens of rome ?

07:43.428 --> 07:44.579
what did they do ?

07:44.626 --> 07:45.871
did they rise up,

07:46.058 --> 07:49.264
burn their bras and their draft cards ?

07:51.624 --> 07:52.387
no.

07:52.704 --> 07:54.366
they went to the colosseum.

07:55.857 --> 07:57.983
they stood idle

07:58.018 --> 08:00.065
while an evil man

08:00.781 --> 08:02.554
destroyed their world.

08:02.907 --> 08:04.280
in your lifetime,

08:04.339 --> 08:07.686
each of you may be faced
with a similar situation.

08:07.744 --> 08:09.111
the question is...

08:09.228 --> 08:12.269
will you leave your footprints
on the history of time

08:13.209 --> 08:16.849
or let them be washed away by
the tides of more powerful men ?

08:23.745 --> 08:24.672
mr. kent...

08:27.056 --> 08:28.136
what about you ?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.551
me ? i, um...

08:31.586 --> 08:35.508
luthorcorp practically owns
your hometown of smallville.

08:36.072 --> 08:39.230
what if you found out that lex luthor,

08:39.265 --> 08:41.884
the emperor of the company,

08:42.339 --> 08:44.169
was a dangerous,

08:44.523 --> 08:45.673
unstable

08:46.566 --> 08:47.763
megalomaniac

08:48.186 --> 08:50.546
<i>bent on destroying your world ?</i>

08:51.459 --> 08:53.796
would you have the courage
to try to stop him ?

08:56.790 --> 08:57.541
i, uh...

09:00.371 --> 09:03.945
read chapter three for monday.
there'll be a quiz on the material.

09:12.187 --> 09:14.277
interesting lecture you've
been giving, professor.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.109
i hope you've been taking notes.

09:16.203 --> 09:17.765
oh, just the highlights.

09:17.976 --> 09:21.264
you've been painting me as the
poster child for corporate villainy.

09:21.948 --> 09:24.942
some of the things you say
come dangerously close to libel.

09:25.294 --> 09:27.689
it's only libel if it isn't true.

09:28.218 --> 09:31.247
everything i say in this classroom
is supported by my research.

09:32.175 --> 09:33.203
and me.

09:33.509 --> 09:35.681
you are a fascinating subject.

09:39.791 --> 09:42.280
you want to know what
fascinates me, professor ?

09:45.572 --> 09:48.613
your lectures have included speculation

09:49.247 --> 09:53.005
in certain luthorcorp projects
that aren't even public knowledge.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.351
i'm sorry, but i never speculate.

09:56.689 --> 10:00.317
the study of history is built
on meticulous research...

10:01.656 --> 10:04.170
even before coming to
obvious conclusions.

10:05.990 --> 10:09.912
and would one of your research
sources be clark kent ?

10:10.898 --> 10:12.836
i know you hired him as your assistant.

10:13.094 --> 10:13.763
now...

10:14.699 --> 10:17.775
why would a man of your stature

10:18.210 --> 10:21.908
be so concerned with the comings
and goings of a freshman farm boy ?

10:23.726 --> 10:26.391
if you know so much about me, professor,

10:26.591 --> 10:28.282
i'm sure you realize that

10:29.292 --> 10:32.918
i donate a considerable amount
of funding to this university.

10:33.552 --> 10:37.791
that allows me an unusual level of access
to the dean and the academic review board.

10:37.814 --> 10:39.312
yeah, i know.

10:40.158 --> 10:43.516
the buying of influence is
part of my second semester.

10:46.909 --> 10:48.985
if you have a second semester.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.859
you should all be very proud.

11:05.894 --> 11:08.793
<i>the four of you were
amazing during rush week,</i>

11:08.829 --> 11:11.846
like little diamonds in the
rough just waiting to be polished.

11:11.893 --> 11:14.861
but not everyone is tri-psi material.

11:14.897 --> 11:16.860
it's sad, but it's a fact.

11:17.917 --> 11:18.610
carol...

11:19.684 --> 11:20.470
bobby...

11:20.846 --> 11:21.692
susan,

11:22.161 --> 11:23.782
please step forward.

11:25.355 --> 11:28.067
the three of you were really great !

11:29.749 --> 11:31.592
but great isn't enough for a tri-psi.

11:31.628 --> 11:34.434
a tri-psi has to be
excellent all over. bye, now.

11:36.183 --> 11:37.780
- Bye, bye
- Goodbye.

11:37.815 --> 11:40.666
w-wait a minute.
you mean that i'm in ?

11:40.736 --> 11:42.110
lana, come on.

11:42.192 --> 11:43.226
you're amazing.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.961
of course we want you to be one of us.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.545
wow.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.165
um, thank you.

11:49.599 --> 11:50.175
but

11:50.257 --> 11:53.639
there is just this little initiation
thing that we have to do first.

12:01.526 --> 12:02.618
what the hell are you ?!

12:02.642 --> 12:04.356
we're tri-psis.

12:04.497 --> 12:06.831
we're the hottest vampires ever.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.698
welcome to the sisterhood.

12:45.884 --> 12:46.835
nice shot.

12:47.954 --> 12:49.645
you just have to know the angles.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.723
that's why you've been
looking into my past ?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.236
come on, professor.

12:54.894 --> 12:57.428
you're not the only one
interested in history, are you ?

12:57.557 --> 13:00.363
you don't strike me as that
much of an academic type.

13:02.336 --> 13:03.381
what's this ?

13:04.607 --> 13:08.141
i know you're a busy man. i
thought i'd save you some time.

13:08.282 --> 13:09.914
that's my whole life in there...

13:10.219 --> 13:12.550
every record, every achievement,

13:12.597 --> 13:14.158
every failure,

13:14.393 --> 13:16.295
all the way back to the day i was born.

13:16.331 --> 13:18.456
and i'm supposed to just
swallow all of this ?

13:22.473 --> 13:25.010
you wouldn't be the great lex luthor...

13:25.256 --> 13:26.560
if you did.

13:26.736 --> 13:29.671
no, you'll spend a fortune
checking and rechecking...

13:30.895 --> 13:33.443
...convinced what you
believe must be true.

13:34.969 --> 13:36.343
and, uh...

13:37.094 --> 13:39.267
what is it i believe, professor ?

13:40.333 --> 13:43.715
that everyone is hiding
secrets as dark as yours.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.170
how did you get this ?

13:50.323 --> 13:52.013
just used my brain.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.845
it's an interesting document, isn't it ?

13:53.904 --> 13:57.403
it seems to indicate you're
using funding to the university

13:57.436 --> 14:01.029
to conduct questionable
luthorcorp experiments...

14:05.166 --> 14:06.199
...on campus...

14:08.583 --> 14:10.238
but off the corporate books.

14:19.186 --> 14:21.710
i wonder what the dean
would think about that.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.089
never start a game

14:27.125 --> 14:28.404
you can't win.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.166
mr. luthor.

14:38.653 --> 14:39.569
follow him.

14:40.543 --> 14:41.705
with pleasure, sir.

15:12.122 --> 15:13.472
what are you doing ?

15:16.372 --> 15:17.488
i'm redecorating.

15:17.511 --> 15:19.167
karen, this is my side of the room.

15:19.191 --> 15:21.340
yeah, but i've got to look at it, okay ?

15:21.375 --> 15:22.185
now, listen to me.

15:22.209 --> 15:25.934
i did not spend four
years of high-school misery

15:25.957 --> 15:27.730
dreaming about coming to met u...

15:28.441 --> 15:29.944
for this, okay ?

15:29.980 --> 15:31.224
- but i didn't
- no, okay ?

15:31.259 --> 15:33.960
and while we're on the subject
of roommate etiquette...

15:35.075 --> 15:37.998
can you please tell the chica
over here

15:38.657 --> 15:41.428
this isn't the betty ford clinic, okay ?

15:42.837 --> 15:44.269
i'm gonna go now.

15:50.162 --> 15:52.663
i'd rather be roommates
with a two-headed monkey.

15:54.964 --> 15:56.150
all right, lana...

15:56.268 --> 15:58.757
rise and shine, sleeping beauty.

15:58.804 --> 16:00.035
up and at 'em.

16:00.164 --> 16:04.496
<i>okay, for someone with a keen weird-dar,
i can't believe i did not see the signs.</i>

16:04.543 --> 16:09.573
<i>but i defy anyone to tell the difference between a
nascent vampire and a freshman girl with a hangover.</i>

16:10.242 --> 16:12.262
didn't you have class this morning ?

16:14.070 --> 16:16.008
i must have overslept.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.720
wow. first official day on campus,
and you're already hung over.

16:19.755 --> 16:22.115
maybe you really are sorority material.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.503
- is lana here ?
- hey.

16:28.691 --> 16:30.912
yeah, what's left of her.

16:30.947 --> 16:33.930
pledge party... higher
learning at its best.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.830
maybe you should see if you
can breathe some life into her.

16:37.652 --> 16:42.008
i'll be at the library, researching
ways to kill my roommate.

16:49.668 --> 16:51.324
rough night last night ?

16:52.158 --> 16:53.085
i guess.

16:54.729 --> 16:56.338
it's all a little fuzzy.

16:57.899 --> 16:59.671
well, it must have been some party.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.364
i, uh, tried to call you
a few times last night

17:06.411 --> 17:08.172
and again this morning. did
you get any of my messages ?

17:08.219 --> 17:12.376
no, i haven't checked
my voice mail yet. sorry.

17:15.863 --> 17:17.037
lana, are you okay ?

17:18.904 --> 17:19.772
uh-huh.

17:20.983 --> 17:21.981
i'm just...

17:22.415 --> 17:24.012
feeling a bit dead.

17:38.463 --> 17:39.367
god.

17:40.389 --> 17:42.361
you smell amazing.

17:43.524 --> 17:45.355
is that new aftershave ?

17:45.496 --> 17:47.046
no, it's just the...

17:48.232 --> 17:49.169
the usual.

17:52.915 --> 17:55.404
well, maybe we should
try something unusual.

17:57.787 --> 17:58.724
lana, i...

18:00.462 --> 18:02.704
shut up, clark. you talk too much.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.487
lana... lana...

18:06.002 --> 18:07.094
lana, stop.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.184
what's going on with you ?

18:09.419 --> 18:12.119
we're not in high school
anymore, clark. things change.

18:12.154 --> 18:13.047
i can see that.

18:13.079 --> 18:16.531
we're in college now.
live a little... i plan to.

18:16.684 --> 18:17.823
what does that mean ?

18:19.032 --> 18:21.075
it means exactly what i said.

18:22.531 --> 18:27.505
if you're going to be all needy and insecure,
maybe we need to re-evaluate this relationship.

18:52.922 --> 18:56.094
you shouldn't be putting your hands
on things that aren't yours, professor.

18:57.856 --> 18:58.642
actually...

19:01.437 --> 19:02.411
it is mine.

19:35.110 --> 19:36.742
<i>i googled "vampires."</i>

19:36.777 --> 19:39.360
<i>their historic traits
include aversion to sunlight,</i>

19:39.379 --> 19:44.487
<i>elongated canines, an insatiable
hunger for human blood... oh, and</i>

19:44.545 --> 19:45.637
<i>immortality.</i>

19:46.365 --> 19:49.970
<i>poor lana's about to find out
about the last one the hard way.</i>

19:55.899 --> 19:57.846
looks like we picked a winner !

19:57.893 --> 20:02.308
god, this is so much better than
sitting around listening to my boyfriend

20:02.331 --> 20:04.082
whine about his feelings.

20:04.235 --> 20:07.781
you're a tri-psi now, lana. we
eat boyfriends for breakfast.

20:08.027 --> 20:10.505
well, then... to breakfast !

20:10.564 --> 20:12.125
to breakfast !

20:17.339 --> 20:18.031
whoa.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.896
maybe i should slow down a little bit.

20:22.035 --> 20:23.691
where's the fun in that ?

20:23.843 --> 20:27.906
you are not one of the normal,
boring people anymore, lana.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.818
you're one of us now.

20:30.065 --> 20:32.941
and we do things a little more exciting.

20:33.282 --> 20:34.362
like what ?

20:34.747 --> 20:35.607
like this.

20:53.284 --> 20:55.726
oh...my god. did you see her face ?

20:55.773 --> 20:56.830
she was all like...

21:22.306 --> 21:24.921
oh. didn't we tell you ?

21:26.165 --> 21:27.844
you get to live forever.

21:30.909 --> 21:31.825
cool.

21:38.604 --> 21:40.659
i don't know what's going on with lana,

21:40.703 --> 21:43.380
but i went over to the
sorority house today to say hi,

21:43.415 --> 21:46.903
and one of the pretty, plastic people
told me that she was still asleep

21:46.950 --> 21:48.699
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

21:48.734 --> 21:50.754
i tried calling her, too,
but she won't pick up.

21:51.264 --> 21:52.873
maybe she needs a little space.

21:52.908 --> 21:55.139
or some serious deprogramming.

21:55.278 --> 21:56.041
what do you mean ?

21:56.076 --> 21:59.223
i'm pulling up some information
for a story i'm working on, and

21:59.258 --> 22:03.532
i think there's a lot more going on at that
house than just pedicures and pillow fights.

22:03.579 --> 22:05.444
i think you better get over here...

22:06.994 --> 22:07.651
hey.

22:09.342 --> 22:10.211
clark...

22:10.281 --> 22:11.230
what do you got ?

22:11.277 --> 22:12.921
besides a heart attack ?

22:13.637 --> 22:17.312
okay, six years ago tri-psi
was just your regular sorority,

22:17.347 --> 22:19.200
and then their new president took over.

22:19.235 --> 22:20.597
- buffy sanders.
- yeah.

22:20.644 --> 22:24.307
after that, they became the
most exclusive sorority at met u.

22:24.343 --> 22:30.239
they get more pledges than any greek sorority every year,
but they only choose one girl to be a part of tri-psi.

22:30.263 --> 22:31.073
lana.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.574
yeah. now, it looks like
she's a member for life.

22:33.609 --> 22:37.003
according to this, ever
since buffy sanders took over,

22:37.035 --> 22:40.135
not one tri-psi has
ever left the sisterhood.

22:40.487 --> 22:42.648
think that has to do with
the way lana's been acting ?

22:42.683 --> 22:46.123
i think that there's only
one way that we can be sure.

22:48.886 --> 22:50.002
costume party ?

22:50.037 --> 22:53.101
it's the perfect cover for us
to get in there and poke around.

22:53.137 --> 22:54.229
i hate costumes.

23:05.554 --> 23:06.317
invitation ?

23:07.961 --> 23:09.100
right, invitation.

23:09.147 --> 23:14.395
i had one when i was at the nail salon,
and then, um... and then, of course, i went

23:14.442 --> 23:17.528
to get waxed and to the
tanning bed, so i, um...

23:19.829 --> 23:21.602
carlos, do you remember where i put it ?

23:23.749 --> 23:24.537
carlos.

23:27.706 --> 23:28.422
no.

23:29.091 --> 23:30.101
no, i don't.

23:32.308 --> 23:35.510
i'm not supposed to let you
in without an invitation.

23:39.256 --> 23:41.958
but i won't tell if you don't...

23:42.463 --> 23:43.626
carlos.

23:45.983 --> 23:48.472
great. okay, well...

23:54.155 --> 23:55.729
let's go, carlos.

23:55.776 --> 23:56.509
sorry.

24:04.798 --> 24:07.053
so, uh, carlos, huh ?

24:07.238 --> 24:08.670
starts with a "c."

24:08.694 --> 24:11.054
don't you think the
cape is a little much ?

24:11.089 --> 24:12.310
i kind of like it.

24:13.273 --> 24:16.547
it's not too bad. i mean,
the mask slides around.

24:17.005 --> 24:19.235
i can hardly see anything sometimes.

24:24.582 --> 24:28.222
um, why don't you check upstairs,
see if you can find anything ?

24:28.257 --> 24:29.937
i'll scope things out down here.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.543
- if you see lana...
- i'll let her know that you're here.

24:37.244 --> 24:38.125
lana !

24:40.238 --> 24:41.049
lana !

24:42.199 --> 24:42.869
hey.

24:43.620 --> 24:47.148
go play with your six-shooter. me and
the kitty cat here need to have a talk.

25:06.031 --> 25:07.534
what are you doing in here ?

25:07.569 --> 25:09.741
i was, uh, looking for the bathroom.

25:13.899 --> 25:15.049
sorry, buf.

25:30.131 --> 25:32.726
lana, what is wrong with you ?

25:32.949 --> 25:35.555
i'm having fun. you
should try it sometime.

25:35.648 --> 25:37.750
what if clark saw you with that guy ?

25:37.774 --> 25:42.318
you remember clark, right ? your boyfriend
who cares about you more than anything ?

25:42.904 --> 25:44.935
you sure know how to
ruin a party, don't you ?

25:46.462 --> 25:49.902
lana, i don't know what's
going on, but this isn't you.

25:49.937 --> 25:52.086
you wouldn't hurt clark like this.

25:53.683 --> 25:55.375
i'm sorry, chloe...

25:57.101 --> 25:59.156
...but you shouldn't have come here.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.387
oh, sweetie... this isn't a movie.

26:08.746 --> 26:11.400
<i>never confront a vampire
when they're hungry,</i>

26:11.435 --> 26:13.478
<i>even if they are your best friend.</i>

26:20.476 --> 26:22.636
clark ! Please help me.

26:27.198 --> 26:27.915
lana ?

26:51.102 --> 26:52.969
frankly, i don't know what else to try.

26:53.051 --> 26:55.764
we've given her a transfusion,
but there's been no improvement.

26:55.881 --> 26:57.043
what's wrong with her ?

26:57.289 --> 27:00.424
well, as near as we can tell, she's
been infected with some sort of

27:00.507 --> 27:02.162
rabies-like virus.

27:02.632 --> 27:05.638
it was probably transmitted in the
saliva of whatever animal bit her.

27:05.837 --> 27:07.728
it's attacking her red blood cells,

27:08.026 --> 27:09.565
preventing them from regenerating.

27:09.682 --> 27:11.197
is there anything you can do ?

27:11.913 --> 27:13.381
we can keep up the transfusions,

27:13.979 --> 27:15.259
hope she stabilizes.

27:16.410 --> 27:17.631
i'm sorry.

27:25.438 --> 27:26.917
you have to fight it, chloe.

27:28.244 --> 27:29.477
you have to fight it.

27:30.632 --> 27:31.982
is she all right ?

27:34.777 --> 27:36.503
professor, what are you doing here ?

27:37.947 --> 27:39.755
visiting a sick colleague.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.628
though he seems to be doing
better than your friend.

27:43.649 --> 27:44.647
what happened to her ?

27:45.000 --> 27:45.986
she was...

27:46.303 --> 27:46.996
bitten.

27:48.986 --> 27:49.984
by what ?

27:50.629 --> 27:52.517
i know how this is gonna sound,

27:53.797 --> 27:55.957
but i think she was
attacked by a vampire.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.936
clark, there's no
such thing as vampires.

28:00.959 --> 28:02.567
i know what i saw, professor.

28:04.446 --> 28:06.078
she's lost a lot of blood,

28:06.559 --> 28:10.057
and the transfusion didn't work because
she's infected by some weird strain of...

28:10.632 --> 28:11.419
rabies.

28:12.170 --> 28:12.992
rabies ?

28:25.391 --> 28:28.784
you might want to have a word
with your buddy lex luthor.

28:29.381 --> 28:30.050
lex ?

28:30.602 --> 28:33.092
ask him about project 1138.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.495
you got that just from
looking at chloe's chart ?

28:37.528 --> 28:40.134
i recognize the symptoms from
my research at luthorcorp.

28:40.158 --> 28:43.739
now, do you want to stand around here playing 20
questions, or do you want to save your friend's life ?

28:52.603 --> 28:56.090
how could you be so stupid ?!

28:56.184 --> 28:59.983
you never leave anyone alive.
you have to finish them off.

29:00.019 --> 29:02.320
or turn them by making
them drink your blood.

29:02.813 --> 29:04.621
oh, that guy carlos saw you.

29:04.645 --> 29:05.643
his name's clark.

29:05.678 --> 29:08.167
oh, whatever. he saw you feeding.

29:08.202 --> 29:10.879
and he was sneaking around my room.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.687
that's two strikes. i'm
not waiting for a third.

29:13.722 --> 29:14.990
he's my boyfriend.

29:15.025 --> 29:16.411
so ? lana,

29:16.622 --> 29:19.006
you are going to live forever now.

29:19.029 --> 29:21.060
he's gonna get old and withered

29:21.081 --> 29:23.629
and sag in places that you
don't want to see sagging.

29:23.665 --> 29:25.884
you're special. he's not... deal.

29:25.919 --> 29:27.187
what are you gonna do to him ?

29:27.211 --> 29:28.594
Oh, me ?

29:29.076 --> 29:30.074
oh, honey,

29:30.297 --> 29:32.293
this is your freshman mess.

29:32.856 --> 29:35.275
find clark and bring him back here

29:35.522 --> 29:38.668
with just enough life in him
so we can all have a taste...

29:40.841 --> 29:43.823
...or you're the one we'll
be feeding off of tonight.

29:54.038 --> 29:54.915
lex !

29:55.361 --> 29:58.214
project 1138... what is it ?

29:59.975 --> 30:01.760
- i never heard of it.
- don't lie to me.

30:01.795 --> 30:03.932
i know it has something to
do with the rabies virus.

30:03.956 --> 30:06.427
chloe's in the hospital
dying from it right now,

30:06.697 --> 30:08.658
and i think lana's been infected, too.

30:09.903 --> 30:10.596
lana ?

30:11.042 --> 30:12.239
no more games.

30:12.531 --> 30:15.619
if you know anything about what's
going on, you got to tell me right now,

30:16.006 --> 30:17.380
before it's too late.

30:24.259 --> 30:25.880
six years ago,

30:25.973 --> 30:30.013
a girl named buffy sanders was trapped in
a cave outside smallville for several days.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.889
i know, lex. i read
the newspaper article.

30:31.912 --> 30:34.378
certain facts never
made it into the press.

30:34.413 --> 30:35.270
like what ?

30:36.374 --> 30:38.582
luthorcorp aided in her rescue.

30:38.781 --> 30:43.408
after she was transported to the hospital, the site
was discovered to possess unusual characteristics.

30:43.432 --> 30:45.756
lex, quit dancing around.
what did luthorcorp find ?

30:45.780 --> 30:46.872
meteor rocks.

30:48.199 --> 30:51.942
they had soaked into the water
table, creating infected stalactites,

30:51.977 --> 30:54.725
which in turn infected
the indigenous animal life

30:54.760 --> 30:56.686
desmodus rotundus...

30:56.979 --> 30:58.449
vampire bats.

30:58.872 --> 31:00.774
so we are dealing with vampires.

31:01.256 --> 31:03.498
there's nothing mystical
about this, clark.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.715
it's just a very unusual disease.

31:06.020 --> 31:10.623
one of the luthorcorp researchers was accidentally
bitten and quickly developed unusual strength,

31:10.658 --> 31:13.195
aversion to bright light,
and adaptive canine teeth.

31:13.230 --> 31:14.004
fangs ?

31:14.403 --> 31:16.963
seemed to help with the
cannibalistic tendencies.

31:17.796 --> 31:19.241
what happened to him, lex ?

31:19.276 --> 31:21.096
he retired to sausalito...

31:21.624 --> 31:22.622
after we cured him.

31:23.656 --> 31:27.073
we were able to create a serum
that reverses the infection.

31:27.531 --> 31:29.973
the stalactite... it
keeps the serum active.

31:30.994 --> 31:36.116
now, it needs to be administered directly into the heart
in order to carry through the bloodstream effectively.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.234
clark, are you all right ?

31:50.173 --> 31:50.854
lana ?

31:58.126 --> 32:00.497
i'm sorry it has to be this way, clark,

32:00.826 --> 32:03.491
but we don't always get
to choose who we are.

32:04.525 --> 32:08.138
sometimes our destiny leads us to
places that we don't want to go,

32:08.631 --> 32:10.487
and there's nothing we can do about it.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.446
lana, no.

32:13.657 --> 32:15.125
i love you, clark.

32:15.782 --> 32:17.050
i always will.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.268
buffy was wrong about you, clark.

32:48.541 --> 32:50.161
you are special...

32:50.314 --> 32:51.535
aren't you ?

33:12.567 --> 33:14.128
nice work.

33:15.056 --> 33:16.500
he's quite a catch...

33:16.641 --> 33:19.108
100% corn-fed kansas beef.

33:19.308 --> 33:20.330
let's eat.

33:22.032 --> 33:22.819
wait.

33:23.476 --> 33:25.308
isn't there something
else we can do with him ?

33:25.355 --> 33:26.130
like what ?

33:26.459 --> 33:27.361
barbecue ?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.120
no, like convert him...

33:31.060 --> 33:32.375
into one of us.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.985
we're a sorority, not a fraternity.

33:40.384 --> 33:41.969
no boys allowed.

33:42.239 --> 33:43.777
you don't understand.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.032
he's special.

33:45.196 --> 33:46.288
not to me.

33:47.274 --> 33:48.484
get out of the way.

33:48.754 --> 33:49.505
no.

33:50.374 --> 33:51.783
excuse me.

33:51.889 --> 33:54.425
he's mine. you're not touching him.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.274
oh.

34:07.293 --> 34:09.641
i'm really disappointed in you, lana.

34:09.935 --> 34:13.234
looks like you're not
tri-psi material after all.

34:24.393 --> 34:26.284
looks like i'm making the rules now.

34:26.366 --> 34:27.989
anyone have a problem with that ?

34:28.024 --> 34:31.558
- no, no. congratulations.
- that's great.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.838
get out !

34:45.533 --> 34:47.858
clark, it's okay. i'm here.

34:48.905 --> 34:51.453
listen to me. you're sick.

34:51.512 --> 34:52.299
no.

34:52.686 --> 34:54.235
no, i'm not.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.303
i've never felt better.

34:57.207 --> 34:59.776
clark, i know what's inside of you.

34:59.811 --> 35:01.349
i felt your strength.

35:02.195 --> 35:04.285
and now i want you to feel mine.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.883
no.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.231
it's not who you are.

35:09.501 --> 35:11.368
but maybe it is.

35:12.857 --> 35:15.722
maybe i've been hiding
it from you all along,

35:16.591 --> 35:20.536
just like you were hiding
who you really are from me.

35:21.722 --> 35:22.683
no, please.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.325
clark, don't fight it.

35:25.654 --> 35:28.284
we were meant to be together.
you know that in your heart.

35:28.319 --> 35:30.022
and this way, we can be...

35:30.703 --> 35:31.478
forever.

35:32.065 --> 35:34.470
all it takes is one drop of blood.

35:35.726 --> 35:36.454
no.

36:08.444 --> 36:12.976
<i>so, the tri-psis got booted off campus, and all
the infected girls were treated by luthorcorp.</i>

36:13.009 --> 36:16.402
<i>the upside was that my roommate was so
freaked-out that she transferred to nyu,</i>

36:16.426 --> 36:19.655
<i>which means lana and i are
once again under the same roof.</i>

36:19.831 --> 36:23.494
<i>as for clark and lana, they seem
to be able to survive anything.</i>

36:23.706 --> 36:26.089
how much of what
happened do you remember ?

36:26.993 --> 36:30.822
bits and pieces. nothing
coherent, thank god.

36:31.292 --> 36:34.815
but there, uh... there was
one thing that stuck with me,

36:35.249 --> 36:37.325
something i felt when i bit you.

36:38.675 --> 36:39.744
what was that ?

36:41.329 --> 36:42.320
warmth...

36:44.464 --> 36:45.427
and love...

36:46.448 --> 36:49.442
and an overwhelming feeling of strength.

36:53.229 --> 36:56.904
i think for a moment i felt
what was inside your heart.

36:58.912 --> 37:02.124
and i've never felt closer
to someone in my entire life.

37:04.919 --> 37:06.798
i miss being with you, clark.

37:20.259 --> 37:21.222
how's lana ?

37:22.253 --> 37:24.284
she's back to normal, same as chloe.

37:25.986 --> 37:29.767
look, i know things haven't been great between us,
but i just wanted to say i appreciate your help.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.094
that means a lot to me, clark.

37:34.714 --> 37:36.957
there is something i'm
still curious about.

37:37.943 --> 37:40.632
how did you know about project 1138 ?

37:41.889 --> 37:43.096
does it matter ?

37:43.202 --> 37:45.233
only if it came from professor fine.

37:45.386 --> 37:47.030
what do you have against him, lex ?

37:47.194 --> 37:49.202
clark, he's the one
who's been attacking me.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.781
is that why you stopped by his lecture ?
to force him to stop looking at luthorcorp ?

37:53.779 --> 37:55.787
he's doing a lot more than looking.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.753
he's obtaining highly
classified proprietary documents.

37:59.788 --> 38:00.904
he's only after the truth.

38:00.939 --> 38:02.501
i think he's after more than that.

38:04.802 --> 38:05.434
look,

38:06.256 --> 38:07.488
just be careful.

38:08.017 --> 38:10.553
i don't believe fine is
the friend you think he is.

38:18.949 --> 38:22.119
<i>the most exciting part of finishing
a story is not finishing the story</i>

38:22.155 --> 38:24.432
<i>but having someone else read it.</i>

38:36.086 --> 38:38.149
is that a good "hmm" or a bad "hmm" ?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.169
no, it's a good "hmm,"

38:40.803 --> 38:44.748
<i>if we printed tabloid nonsense
like the inquisitor does.</i>

38:45.183 --> 38:47.503
<i>but we're the daily planet,</i>

38:47.538 --> 38:52.893
and tall tales about slaying buffy the vampire
don't make it into the pages of a real newspaper.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.006
miss kahn, i didn't make this up.

38:55.593 --> 38:58.165
they weren't vampires
of the mythical sense.

38:58.201 --> 39:00.584
they were victims of an unusual disease.

39:00.608 --> 39:02.897
look, here... that's all the research...

39:03.003 --> 39:06.948
interviews, eyewitness accounts,
the cdc report, everything.

39:09.367 --> 39:12.645
- was that a good "hmm" or a bad
- shut up. here's the thing.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.874
your writing shows that you're
not completely without talent.

39:15.921 --> 39:16.707
thank you.

39:16.930 --> 39:19.440
but you're not a real
reporter, either...

39:19.863 --> 39:20.591
yet.

39:21.213 --> 39:23.421
well, everyone has to start somewhere.

39:24.959 --> 39:26.981
<i>welcome to the daily planet, kid.</i>

39:27.979 --> 39:29.142
oh, my god.

39:29.553 --> 39:31.150
thank you so much.

39:31.455 --> 39:33.193
uh, where do i start ?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.856
same place i did... at the bottom.

39:39.766 --> 39:42.325
<i>she never did print the
article, but i don't care.</i>

39:42.419 --> 39:45.068
<i>i got in on the ground
floor of my dream.</i>

39:46.406 --> 39:49.694
<i>okay, so it's actually the
basement, but the daily planet.</i>

39:49.729 --> 39:53.602
<i>The paper of record for kings, presidents and prime ministers.</i>

39:54.389 --> 39:56.773
<i>Not to mention future super heroes.</i>

39:57.090 --> 40:00.788
<i>but the way i look at it,
i had no place to go but up,</i>

40:01.094 --> 40:01.785
up,

40:02.701 --> 40:03.804
and away.
