what appears to be

00:32.363 --> 00:33.744
a groundbreaking
piece of art,

00:33.744 --> 00:36.287
but your studio time is up.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.418
You're kicking us out?

00:37.418 --> 00:39.420
But Liam, we're not finished
with our video.

00:39.420 --> 00:40.791
You know how it works here.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.584
The more subscribers you have,
the more studio time you get.

00:43.584 --> 00:45.586
And nobody has
more subscribers than,

00:45.586 --> 00:47.378
and I can't believe
I'm saying this,

00:47.378 --> 00:48.509
JiffPom.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.932
Paige:
JiffPom!

00:51.932 --> 00:53.974
Frankie, look!
It's Jiff Pom!

00:53.974 --> 00:55.306
I don't care who it is.

00:55.306 --> 00:56.767

00:56.767 --> 01:00.731
Oh, that is the cutest
thing I've ever seen!

01:01.812 --> 01:04.394
I-- I mean,
this isn't fair.

01:04.394 --> 01:06.947
Liam, we just hit
15,000 subscribers.

01:06.947 --> 01:10.741
(gasps)
Yes, 15,000
sounds like a lot.

01:10.741 --> 01:12.903
JiffPom, how many do you have?

01:12.903 --> 01:14.325
He doesn't speak.
I'll answer for him.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.827
Over two million.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.580
Come on. We barely get
any studio time.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.002
We're gonna lose subscribers
if we don't post videos on--

01:22.002 --> 01:25.796
Oh, my gosh, he's walking
on his hind legs now!

01:27.468 --> 01:29.049
How splendid.

01:29.049 --> 01:30.971
I can also walk
on two legs.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.805
He's like a little person!

01:34.805 --> 01:37.268

02:46.587 --> 02:47.958
if we can't get
more studio time?

02:47.958 --> 02:49.710
Bernie, you're our agent.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.592
Can't you talk to Liam
and work something out?

02:51.592 --> 02:54.465
I tried, but that guy
won't give me anything.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.006
I can't get an access card,

02:56.006 --> 02:57.888
I'm not allowed
to use the bathrooms,

02:57.888 --> 03:01.181
Liam won't even let me throw
my trash in the trash cans.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.064
I have to shove it in my pockets
until I get home.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.400
Ugh. Why did I bring papaya?

03:11.362 --> 03:14.114
I'm just sayin'
it's a little suspicious

03:14.114 --> 03:16.487
that I'm missing
an entire box of face powder

03:16.487 --> 03:18.909
and you have a channel
where you do stupid dares.

03:18.909 --> 03:20.281
Wasn't me.

03:20.281 --> 03:21.582
(coughs)

03:23.083 --> 03:24.955
I'll pay you back.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.588
Guys, you've been
at Vuuugle a long time.

03:27.588 --> 03:29.420
What's the best way
to get more subscribers?

03:29.420 --> 03:31.792
Easy peasy, just find
a popular channel

03:31.792 --> 03:33.093
and make a video
with them.

03:33.093 --> 03:34.965
Then viewers
from both channels will watch.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.096
It's called a collab.

03:36.096 --> 03:39.049
"Collab" is short
for "collabradoodle."

03:39.049 --> 03:40.391
No, it's not.

03:40.391 --> 03:41.972
Agree to disagree.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.143
(coughs)

03:44.805 --> 03:46.557
I also ate some eyeshadow.

03:47.688 --> 03:49.270
Collab's a great idea.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.981
Can either of you
do one with us?

03:50.981 --> 03:54.985
Sorry, Dirk and I are already
doing our own collab this week.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.358
The beauty
and lifestyle guru...

03:57.358 --> 04:00.951
And the maniac
who does dares or something.

04:00.951 --> 04:02.823
It's the collab
of a lifetime!

04:02.823 --> 04:05.666
Imagine what will happen
when the two of us...

04:05.666 --> 04:06.787
get together.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.290
So what's gonna happen?

04:09.290 --> 04:10.791
-Probably dares.
-Probably makeovers.

04:12.172 --> 04:15.085
Yeah, that's gonna be a mess.

04:15.085 --> 04:16.587
We need subscribers now.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.298
We gotta find
a collab partner fast.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.550
(coughs)

04:20.721 --> 04:22.343
Okay, I have a problem.

04:28.349 --> 04:31.482
I got nothing. I asked
almost everyone at Vuuugle,

04:31.482 --> 04:33.273
but no one wants
to collab with newbies.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.315
How about you?

04:34.315 --> 04:36.987
I talked to JiffPom.
He said he'd get back to me.

04:38.108 --> 04:39.610
Paige and Frankie:
Aww!

04:42.903 --> 04:44.825
"No thanks, newbies."

04:44.825 --> 04:46.246
Both:
Aww.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.169
Paige:
Bye, JiffPom.

04:50.501 --> 04:53.794
Hey, isn't that Victor
from Prank Town?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.797
Frankie:
Ugh, why does he have
such a popular channel?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.179
His pranks aren't even funny.
They're just mean.

04:59.179 --> 05:00.761
It's terrible, Mom.

05:00.761 --> 05:03.263
The doctor says I have
mad penguin virus.

05:03.263 --> 05:05.806
It's incurable
and highly contagious.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.267
Achoo!

05:07.267 --> 05:10.190
Dude, did you just give me
mad penguin virus?

05:10.190 --> 05:12.853
This can't be happening.
I have a family.

05:12.853 --> 05:15.235
Well, you can
tell them what's up

05:15.235 --> 05:18.198
'cause I just took
this clown to Prank Town!

05:18.198 --> 05:19.740
(upbeat music plays)

05:19.740 --> 05:21.942
What? I thought
I was gonna die!

05:21.942 --> 05:23.534
Ha! Hilarious, right?

05:25.245 --> 05:27.157
That's why I hate mean pranks.

05:27.157 --> 05:29.660
They're always like,
"Ha-ha, you had a normal

05:29.660 --> 05:32.543
"human reaction to a situation
we knew would hurt you.

05:32.543 --> 05:34.254
"You're dumb."

05:34.254 --> 05:36.717
Yeah. If I ever
talk to that jerk,

05:36.717 --> 05:38.338
I'm gonna give him
a piece of my mind.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.341
-Hey, girls.
-Hey, Victor!

05:41.341 --> 05:43.343
Oh, Paige.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.515
Sorry to bother you.

05:44.515 --> 05:47.097
I just want to say that
I love Bizaardvark videos.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.430
-Mmm!
-Well, we don't like yours.

05:49.430 --> 05:51.772
-We think your pranks
are horrendous.
-(laughs)

05:51.772 --> 05:54.064
We think a lot of things.

05:54.064 --> 05:56.106
So you're really
a big fan?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.609
Oh, yeah. I drive my team nuts
quoting your stuff.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.780
Just ask my boy Teddy.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.072
Uh, yeah.
Can't get enough of you.

06:02.072 --> 06:04.695
You guys are geniuses.

06:04.695 --> 06:06.447
We're geniuses?

06:06.447 --> 06:09.159
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
one of us isn't.

06:09.159 --> 06:11.752
So I heard you guys were
looking for a collab partner.

06:11.752 --> 06:13.914
How would you like
to come to my channel
and do a prank with me?

06:13.914 --> 06:15.996
Well, I can't speak
for Frankie--

06:15.996 --> 06:17.047
I can. No.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.710
but I'm sure
she'd be open to it.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.921
Well, let me know.

06:20.921 --> 06:23.133
My five million subscribers
would love you guys.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.345
Did you say five million?

06:25.345 --> 06:26.467
Did I?

06:26.467 --> 06:29.009
Or did my trophy
for five million subscribers

06:29.009 --> 06:30.100
say it for me?

06:32.222 --> 06:33.724
Great meeting you!

06:34.935 --> 06:36.146
What's wrong with me?

06:37.778 --> 06:40.070
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

06:41.151 --> 06:42.613
Wait a second.

06:42.613 --> 06:46.026
This guy thought
he was gonna die
from mad penguin virus?

06:46.026 --> 06:49.450
Now that's comedy!
(laughs)

06:49.450 --> 06:51.792
Frankie, this could be
huge for us.

06:51.792 --> 06:54.795
Victor has
five million subscribers.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.036
Victor is the opposite

06:56.036 --> 06:57.798
of everything
Bizaardvark stands for.

06:57.798 --> 06:59.880
We try to make people laugh,
not hurt their feelings.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.502
I don't see what
the big deal is.

07:01.502 --> 07:02.753
Pranks are harmless.

07:02.753 --> 07:06.006
Really? Well, if that's
how you feel,

07:06.006 --> 07:07.808
I guess you can't be
our agent anymore.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.640
What?!

07:09.640 --> 07:10.721
Gotcha.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.723
Oh, my...

07:12.723 --> 07:14.434
Why would you do that?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.146
You made me feel horrible
about something

07:16.146 --> 07:17.938
that wasn't true
for no reason!

07:17.938 --> 07:19.770
Yes, Bernie.
That's what a prank is.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.321
Are you sure?

07:21.321 --> 07:23.864
'Cause it's funny
when other people get pranked.

07:23.864 --> 07:25.656
I think you did it wrong.

07:26.867 --> 07:28.529
Look, I don't love
pranks either.

07:28.529 --> 07:31.161
But if we do this collab,
we'll get enough subscribers

07:31.161 --> 07:33.874
to make any video we want
whenever we want.

07:33.874 --> 07:38.168
Any video? Even Marty McCrumbly,
the time traveler who's always
one minute late?

07:39.840 --> 07:41.461
Watch out, dinosaurs!

07:41.461 --> 07:42.883
There's a meteor
that's gonna--

07:42.883 --> 07:44.254
Ooh, uh...

07:44.254 --> 07:48.138
Oh well. At least I can
still save President Lincoln.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.891
Okay. Let's do it.

07:55.015 --> 07:56.687
-(phone chimes)
-They're in.

07:56.687 --> 07:58.188
Good.

07:58.188 --> 08:00.811
I'll use this collab
to ruin Bizaardvark

08:00.811 --> 08:03.734
just like I ruined
all the other comedy channels.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.742
I know what
you're thinking, Teddy.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.825
Why would a guy with a trophy
for five million subscribers

08:14.825 --> 08:16.877
be so worried
about two newbies?

08:16.877 --> 08:19.620
Mm-hmm.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.081
'Cause they're good.

08:21.081 --> 08:23.043
They're gonna keep growing.

08:23.043 --> 08:24.835
And no one can stand
in my way of having

08:24.835 --> 08:26.627
the funniest channel
on Vuuugle.

08:27.928 --> 08:28.929
Right, Teddy?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.552
I'm funny, right?

08:31.552 --> 08:34.183
Yeah, man.
You're hilarious.

08:34.183 --> 08:36.056
(chuckles)

08:36.056 --> 08:38.398
You thought I was
insecure, didn't you?

08:38.398 --> 08:40.020
Well, you've been pranked!

08:41.061 --> 08:42.982
'Cause I'm not.
I'm not insecure.

08:45.065 --> 08:48.068
Ho-ho... you got me.

08:56.496 --> 08:59.039
Bernard M. Schotz,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.500
welcome to my studio.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.963
Whoa, you have video games?

09:02.963 --> 09:04.214
And leather chairs?

09:04.214 --> 09:05.666
And--

09:05.666 --> 09:08.258
Is that an electric
pencil sharpener?

09:08.258 --> 09:09.630
Bernie!

09:10.631 --> 09:13.173
When I first heard
an agent of your caliber

09:13.173 --> 09:15.555
was coming to negotiate
Paige and Frankie's prank,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.938
I gotta admit,
I was a little nervous.

09:17.938 --> 09:18.979
So was I.

09:18.979 --> 09:21.021
I've never really
done this bef...

09:21.021 --> 09:22.893
Okay, let's get down
to business.

09:24.104 --> 09:27.608
My clients are concerned
about doing anything too mean.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.279
Do you have any nice pranks?

09:29.279 --> 09:30.530
Of course.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.323
Every month,
a girl selling cookies
comes into Vuuugle.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.656
I want Paige and Frankie
to destroy her bike.

09:35.656 --> 09:37.788
(laughs)
Destroy her--

09:37.788 --> 09:39.289
Wait.

09:39.289 --> 09:41.912
That's mean.
I can't let my clients do that.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.964
What if I throw in this...

09:43.964 --> 09:45.836
Vuuugle VIP access card

09:45.836 --> 09:47.547
for you?

09:48.669 --> 09:50.260
Well, that certainly
changes things.

09:51.421 --> 09:53.553
I wouldn't have to enter through
the garbage chute anymore.

09:54.805 --> 09:56.807
-What was that?
-I said I date a lot of girls.

09:58.558 --> 10:00.350
You know what?
It's a big decision.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.022
You shouldn't have to make it
on an empty stomach.

10:02.022 --> 10:03.854
Here, have some shrimp.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.107
Oh, I do love shrimp.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.653
Tell you what,
throw in some cocktail sauce,

10:12.653 --> 10:13.824
and you've got yourself a deal.

10:15.285 --> 10:16.787
You are tough.

10:16.787 --> 10:17.998
But fair.

10:23.453 --> 10:24.955
You know we have
trash cans, right?

10:25.956 --> 10:28.839
Oh-ho! Fancy!

10:37.517 --> 10:41.021
Hi, Ameliacs,
and welcome to
Perfectly Palatable,

10:41.021 --> 10:43.183
my collab with Dirk
from DareMeBro.

10:43.183 --> 10:44.855
Dirk, stop it.

10:44.855 --> 10:47.027
You said I could lick the bowl.

10:47.027 --> 10:48.819
Not with everything still in it.

10:51.031 --> 10:53.273
The first thing
we're gonna make
is banana bread.

10:53.273 --> 10:55.696
Dirk, would you like
to educate the viewers?

10:55.696 --> 10:56.737
Sure.

10:57.868 --> 10:59.659
Banana. Bread.

11:01.281 --> 11:02.743
Banana bread!

11:02.743 --> 11:06.246
Yes, that certainly works
if you're an idiot.

11:06.246 --> 11:07.377
(timer dings)

11:07.377 --> 11:08.668
And that sound means

11:08.668 --> 11:10.670
our delicious
chocolate chip cookies

11:10.670 --> 11:12.052
are ready for decoration.

11:12.052 --> 11:14.504
Dirk, can you please
hand me the frosting?

11:14.504 --> 11:15.675
Oh, gosh.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.848
You never know when
the cookies might fight back.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.761
Whatever.

11:20.761 --> 11:24.144
Here are two dozen
perfectly perfect
chocolate chip cookies.

11:27.067 --> 11:30.360
Or one giant cookie
in the shape of a boomerang.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.232
Sweet! A cookie-rang!

11:36.486 --> 11:37.577
I got it!

11:41.321 --> 11:42.372
Dirk...

11:42.372 --> 11:44.875
what am I gonna find
when I check on my cupcakes?

11:44.875 --> 11:48.088
Mm, let's just say
you're gonna need this.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.466
Wait, the prank is what?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.008
Don't worry.

11:58.008 --> 12:02.102
All you have to do is
destroy a little girl's bike.

12:03.433 --> 12:06.476
Bernie, we told you
we didn't want to do
anything mean!

12:06.476 --> 12:08.608
Which is what I told Victor.

12:08.608 --> 12:11.982
So, he said you guys can
give her a new bike
at the end.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.064
That way,
you'll be heroes.

12:15.115 --> 12:16.616
Okay, that
doesn't sound too bad.

12:16.616 --> 12:17.778
That's my motto.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.070
Bernie Schotz--
doesn't down too bad.

12:26.126 --> 12:27.788
All right, girls,
that's our target.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.629
My team just destroyed her bike.

12:29.629 --> 12:30.791
Do what we rehearsed

12:30.791 --> 12:33.173
and take that clown
to Prank Town.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.137
Okay. No big deal.

12:37.137 --> 12:40.550
Just gotta break
a very cute little girl's heart.

12:40.550 --> 12:41.842
Then, she gets a new bike.

12:41.842 --> 12:42.933
(sighs)
Okay.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.845
Five million subscribers.

12:44.845 --> 12:46.476
Five million subscribers.

12:47.978 --> 12:50.440
Did somebody park
their bike outside?

12:50.440 --> 12:51.942
I did!

12:51.942 --> 12:53.313
Oh, man.

12:55.315 --> 12:59.990
Well, uh, it got run over
by a garbage truck.

13:03.904 --> 13:05.535
My bike!

13:05.535 --> 13:08.248
It was a gift
from my grandma

13:08.248 --> 13:10.410
before she died!

13:10.410 --> 13:11.541
(sobs)

13:11.541 --> 13:13.503
Oh, man.

13:14.674 --> 13:17.297
(laughs)
This is gold!

13:19.129 --> 13:20.220
Aww.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.182
Are you sad
about your bike?

13:23.183 --> 13:24.885
That's too bad.

13:24.885 --> 13:26.847
How would you like

13:26.847 --> 13:28.808
a brand new bike?

13:32.192 --> 13:34.524
No way!

13:34.524 --> 13:36.937
This is even better
than the one I had!

13:38.028 --> 13:41.361
And you can thank...
Bizaardvark.

13:41.361 --> 13:42.532
(both chuckle)

13:43.533 --> 13:45.205
Ah, the girl's happy now.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.746
It's not funny anymore.

13:48.368 --> 13:50.120
You guys are the best.

13:53.753 --> 13:55.876
Also my grandma's alive.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.128
I just said that
because I was really upset.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.802
What up,
DareHeads and Ameliacs?

14:02.802 --> 14:05.095
I'm here with
my collab partner Amelia.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.058
And we're gonna do
some intense dares I cooked up.

14:08.058 --> 14:10.350
Thanks for coming
to the lair, Amelia.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.681
I was worried
you were gonna try

14:11.681 --> 14:13.103
and give me a makeover
or something.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.604
Dirk, I would never.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.067
I just came here to clap
and say "bro" a lot.

14:17.067 --> 14:19.189
Okay, first dare.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.571
Stick your face in front
of this giant fan!

14:21.571 --> 14:23.403
Fan me up, bro!

14:30.700 --> 14:32.872
I lied! It's a makeover!

14:34.204 --> 14:36.046
Dirk:
I am so intense right now!

14:38.498 --> 14:40.420
Perfect.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.461
Next dare.

14:41.461 --> 14:45.215
Can your fingernails survive
the torture machine?

14:45.215 --> 14:46.766
Torture me up, bro!

14:48.058 --> 14:49.099
This is nothing!

14:49.099 --> 14:52.182
Oh, yeah?
Think you can do
the other hand?

14:52.182 --> 14:55.185
I'm doing the other hand!

14:55.185 --> 14:58.939
Oh! My fingernails are
shining with intensity!

14:58.939 --> 15:00.780
Final dare.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.073
I call it the reverse Houdini.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.484
You're gonna
go behind here

15:04.484 --> 15:07.077
and break into
this danger suit...

15:07.077 --> 15:08.949
blindfolded.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.161
'Fold me up, bro!

15:11.161 --> 15:12.162
Whoo!

15:15.875 --> 15:19.629
I am changing
so intensely right now!

15:19.629 --> 15:21.591
Wait for it.

15:26.506 --> 15:28.598
You tricky, tricky girl.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.685
I can't collab with you.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.978
All you want to do
is fill the world with beauty.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.769
Well, all you want to do
is have fun

15:39.769 --> 15:41.521
and live
life to the fullest.

15:42.822 --> 15:43.863
Are you guys fighting

15:43.863 --> 15:46.276
or aggressively
complimenting each other?

15:46.276 --> 15:47.617
She's impossible.

15:47.617 --> 15:49.990
I don't know how you
and Paige work together so well.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.871
Well, I guess
we just talk things out.

15:51.871 --> 15:53.833
Oh! Like Victor from Prank Town
asked us to collab

15:53.833 --> 15:55.245
and we both hate--

15:55.245 --> 15:57.417
Both:
You collabed with Victor?

15:57.417 --> 15:59.379
Uh, I can't tell,

15:59.379 --> 16:02.002
is that jealous terror
or happy terror?

16:02.002 --> 16:04.084
We should have warned
you about Victor.

16:04.084 --> 16:05.385
That dude is evil.

16:05.385 --> 16:07.087
He destroys
other comedy channels

16:07.087 --> 16:08.798
so he can stay on top.

16:08.798 --> 16:12.052
That collab was probably
a plan to ruin Bizaardvark.

16:12.052 --> 16:13.683
Okay, that's all very dramatic,

16:13.683 --> 16:15.645
but the fact is,
we don't have any proof--

16:15.645 --> 16:17.357
Victor just posted our collab!

16:17.357 --> 16:20.400
It's called
 Bizaardvark:
 The Evil Among Us.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.193
Ohh.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.196
Hi, friends.

16:26.196 --> 16:27.907
I have unfortunate news.

16:27.907 --> 16:31.241
Recently, I met a comedy duo
called Bizaardvark,

16:31.241 --> 16:33.453
a combination
I assume of "bizarre"...

16:33.453 --> 16:34.614
and cruelty.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.827
They begged me
to collab with them,

16:37.827 --> 16:39.919
but the prank they pulled
crossed the line.

16:39.919 --> 16:41.381
It's so mean, I--

16:41.381 --> 16:43.002
I don't even want
to show it to you.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.214
Take a look!

16:48.048 --> 16:51.681
(sobs)

16:51.681 --> 16:52.892
Aww.

16:52.892 --> 16:55.185
Are you sad
about your bike?

16:56.556 --> 16:59.439
How would you like
a brand new bike?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.312
That's too bad.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.105
(sobs)

17:05.105 --> 17:08.407
And you can thank...
Bizaardvark!

17:08.407 --> 17:09.819
(both chuckle)

17:09.819 --> 17:12.992
(dark music plays)

17:12.992 --> 17:15.575
If you want to stand up to
bullies like Paige and Frankie,

17:15.575 --> 17:18.748
please unsubscribe
from Bizaardvark.

17:18.748 --> 17:20.420
As always...

17:20.420 --> 17:22.252
(upbeat music plays)

17:22.252 --> 17:23.752
Ugh. That jerk!

17:23.752 --> 17:26.005
Victor edited the video
to make us look bad!

17:26.005 --> 17:28.088
Uh, it's not all Victor's fault.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.340
He didn't force you
to wear those outfits.

17:31.381 --> 17:33.673
Sorry. Poor timing.

17:33.673 --> 17:36.936
Uh, guys, your subscribers
are dropping fast.

17:36.936 --> 17:39.309
I can't believe
I trusted him!

17:39.309 --> 17:40.440
I'm sorry, Frankie.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.731
No, I fell for it too.

17:41.731 --> 17:44.774
All I could hear was
"five million subscribers."

17:44.774 --> 17:46.446
What a low-life slimeball.

17:46.446 --> 17:47.947
Ahh.

17:47.947 --> 17:51.991
That Victor is the best!

17:51.991 --> 17:53.823
You know he has
his own masseuse?

17:54.954 --> 17:57.367
So what'd I miss?

17:57.367 --> 18:01.040
Our collab with Victor was
a trap to destroy Bizaardvark.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.752
We have to figure out
a way to expose him

18:02.752 --> 18:04.164
before our channel is ruined.

18:04.164 --> 18:06.626
What? Well, h-- hold on.

18:06.626 --> 18:09.169
On the one hand,

18:09.169 --> 18:11.841
he may have
destroyed your careers,

18:11.841 --> 18:14.804
but in my other hand,

18:14.804 --> 18:17.177
I'm holding a jumbo shrimp.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.812
Well, I'll miss you.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.856
Op, op, op!
Vuuugle property!

18:35.575 --> 18:39.199
A toast to not having to worry
about Bizaardvark anymore.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.001
Yeah, man.
That's cool.

18:43.293 --> 18:44.504
Is it cool, Teddy?

18:44.504 --> 18:46.296
Or are you just
a yes-man who sticks around

18:46.296 --> 18:48.127
'cause I give you perks
like a free cell phone?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.089
Totally. You're hilarious.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.013
Victor, I'm so glad
you're okay.

18:54.013 --> 18:55.175
What are you talking about?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.966
The gas leak in your studio.

18:56.966 --> 18:58.888
What? Teddy, follow me!

19:00.099 --> 19:02.892
Yeah, man! Uh, take them
to Prank City or wherever.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.188
I don't smell any gas!

19:08.188 --> 19:10.230
Behind this wall.

19:10.230 --> 19:11.691
No! Be careful of my trophy!

19:13.693 --> 19:15.074
No!

19:16.536 --> 19:18.117
My baby!

19:18.117 --> 19:19.409
I can fix you!

19:19.409 --> 19:20.490
I can fix you!

19:21.991 --> 19:23.162
Oh, hi, Victor.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.874
Having a good day?

19:24.874 --> 19:26.706
Bizaardvark?

19:26.706 --> 19:28.338
You destroyed my trophy!

19:28.338 --> 19:29.379
Did we?

19:30.550 --> 19:32.342
Or was that just a fake?

19:32.342 --> 19:36.095
All:
We just took this clown
to Prank Town!

19:39.679 --> 19:42.722
Ha-ha, you had
a normal human reaction

19:42.722 --> 19:44.604
to a situation
we knew would hurt you.

19:44.604 --> 19:46.065
You're dumb.

19:47.267 --> 19:48.478
Yeah.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.361
And I was the guy
in the hazmat suit.

19:53.152 --> 19:54.404
They know, Dirk.

19:54.404 --> 19:56.576
Come on. I'll let you eat
some more of my makeup.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.580
Also...

20:02.161 --> 20:04.083
looks like we're not
the first comedy channel

20:04.083 --> 20:05.084
you tried to take down.

20:08.418 --> 20:10.209
I'll fix that later!

20:14.884 --> 20:16.596
Nice work, detectives.

20:16.596 --> 20:17.757
You caught me.

20:17.757 --> 20:19.048
Only one problem.

20:19.048 --> 20:20.720
No one's gonna believe you.

20:23.643 --> 20:25.395
I can slow clap too.

20:26.436 --> 20:27.517
And guess what?

20:27.517 --> 20:29.559
We've been filming
this whole time.

20:29.559 --> 20:30.560
Come on out, Bernie.

20:31.691 --> 20:33.022
For the record,

20:33.022 --> 20:34.814
I'm not mad at you.

20:36.316 --> 20:37.947
We're gonna post that video

20:37.947 --> 20:40.119
and show the world
who you really are.

20:40.119 --> 20:41.571
Any final words?

20:43.072 --> 20:44.123
I'm sorry.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.496
What?

20:46.496 --> 20:49.419
-(sad music plays)
 -The truth is, I'm insecure.

20:49.419 --> 20:51.541
I guess that's why
I do pranks.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.374
To hurt other people
before they have a chance
to hurt me.

20:56.135 --> 20:59.088
Because all it takes
to hurt me...

20:59.088 --> 21:01.841
is to remind me
I'm not funny.

21:01.841 --> 21:03.593
I'm just mean.

21:03.593 --> 21:06.306
Wow, that was
really heartfelt.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.937
but we're still
gonna post it.

21:07.937 --> 21:09.809
Paige, get the laptop!

21:11.351 --> 21:12.982
We can't post this.

21:12.982 --> 21:15.315
We'll be just as bad
as Victor.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.066
It's not worth
getting subscribers

21:17.066 --> 21:18.318
if we compromise
who we are.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.901
Or we can take revenge,

21:21.901 --> 21:23.323
celebrate for five minutes,

21:23.323 --> 21:25.164
then feel awful
for the rest of our lives.

21:26.496 --> 21:27.957
Okay, I see why
you're always better.

21:29.248 --> 21:30.670
Bernie, delete that video.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.171
Uh...

21:32.171 --> 21:35.004
I've kind of been
live-streaming the whole thing.

21:35.004 --> 21:36.676
All:
What?!

21:36.676 --> 21:38.007
Quick! Get the shrimp!

21:38.007 --> 21:39.679
I'll sharpen
as many pencils
as I can!

21:41.801 --> 21:43.012
Go!

21:44.344 --> 21:45.345
Go!

21:46.346 --> 21:47.347
Go!

21:49.479 --> 21:52.892
Well, I don't feel great
about how that went down,

21:52.892 --> 21:55.605
but I think everything
turned out okay.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.987
Yeah. And we lost
some subscribers
because of Victor,

21:57.987 --> 21:59.699
but we gained some back
from exposing him,

21:59.699 --> 22:01.240
which puts us at...

22:01.240 --> 22:02.532
15,000.

22:02.532 --> 22:03.903
Right where we started.

22:03.903 --> 22:06.155
What a massive waste of time.

22:07.707 --> 22:09.869
I'm sorry you won't be
getting anymore perks
around here, Bernie.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.160
That's okay.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.714
I ate so much shrimp,
I've got the seafood poops.

22:14.714 --> 22:18.718
And since I can't use
the bathrooms around here,

22:18.718 --> 22:20.630
oh, my life.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.463
Well, I had a great day.

22:23.463 --> 22:26.426
I got to make a hazmat suit
out of some old raincoats.

22:26.426 --> 22:30.730
And I was the guy
in the hazmat suit.

22:30.730 --> 22:33.773
Dirk, you really need
to stop eating makeup.

22:34.774 --> 22:35.895
Look at you two.

22:35.895 --> 22:38.528
You used your unique skills
for one common goal.

22:38.528 --> 22:40.189
That's, like,
the ultimate collab.

22:40.189 --> 22:41.481
Oh, yeah.

22:41.481 --> 22:43.322
We collabed in real life
even though none

22:43.322 --> 22:46.115
of our millions of fans
will ever see it.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.448
Both:
What a massive waste of time.

22:49.579 --> 22:52.201
But hey, at least
you guys took down Victor.

22:52.201 --> 22:53.663
Oh, did they?

22:54.834 --> 22:57.837
My 500,000 new subscribers
might beg to differ.

22:57.837 --> 22:59.048
That's right.

22:59.048 --> 23:01.130
People love when
you bare your soul online.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.762
All you have to do
is shed a few tears

23:02.762 --> 23:04.383
and pretend
to learn a lesson.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.175
It's Vuuugle 101, newbies.

23:06.175 --> 23:08.137
Wait, you cried on purpose?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.270
I don't know.

23:11.270 --> 23:12.642
Did I?

23:14.143 --> 23:15.775
See you around, Bizaardvark.

23:15.775 --> 23:17.977
Enjoy your channel
while you have it.

23:17.977 --> 23:19.148
'Cause it won't be for long.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.400
Right, Teddy?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.402
Yeah, man.
Tacos sound good.

23:27.236 --> 23:29.949
Does anyone else
think Victor's cute?

23:30.305 --> 23:36.883
