00:18.910 --> 00:22.152
- <i>Previously on</i> Tyrant...
- Marry Mahdiya.

00:22.176 --> 00:23.208
You like her, no?

00:23.277 --> 00:24.676
(all singing)

00:24.861 --> 00:27.257
(explosion)

00:27.536 --> 00:29.736
IHAB: <i>God has sent me a message.</i>

00:29.761 --> 00:31.594
My path is revenge.

00:31.619 --> 00:32.750
Nothing else.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.086
I understand.

00:34.154 --> 00:35.721
I want to know what really happened

00:35.789 --> 00:37.289
when you met with Ihab bin Rashid.

00:37.358 --> 00:38.535
I thought I could convince him

00:38.559 --> 00:39.925
<i>that we both want the same thing</i>

00:39.994 --> 00:41.226
<i>for Abuddin.</i>

00:41.295 --> 00:42.661
LEILA: <i>The offer you made Ihab,</i>

00:42.730 --> 00:44.463
I'm offering you the same thing.

00:44.531 --> 00:46.031
A partnership between us.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.432
I will be the president

00:47.501 --> 00:48.867
and you will be my prime minister.

00:48.936 --> 00:51.136
One day after
announcement of a coalition

00:51.205 --> 00:53.805
with Sheik Al-Qadi, Leila Al Fayeed

00:53.874 --> 00:56.734
has pulled ahead of Fauzi Nidal.

00:56.904 --> 00:58.315
FAUZI: <i>If she gets to be president,</i>

00:58.316 --> 01:00.212
you've amputated your own revolution!

01:00.280 --> 01:02.085
What are the chances of them holding

01:02.086 --> 01:03.348
a coalition like this together?

01:03.417 --> 01:05.615
COGSWELL: Unless you
overwhelm them from the start,

01:05.616 --> 01:07.530
you're gonna fight
them to a draw at best,

01:07.554 --> 01:08.654
which means they win.

01:08.722 --> 01:10.501
And you've got one
chance to get it right.

01:10.502 --> 01:11.890
The president of Abuddin

01:11.959 --> 01:14.359
and his American bombs have
murdered Sheik Abdullah

01:14.428 --> 01:17.162
leaving me the leader of the Caliphate.

01:17.231 --> 01:19.998
For the first time,
we both have an army.

01:20.067 --> 01:22.234
Let's finish this once and for all.

01:22.302 --> 01:25.003
There's an in-patient
treatment center in Germany.

01:25.072 --> 01:26.371
I need to go get better.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.673
You can get better here.

01:27.741 --> 01:30.909
I can't be here anymore.

01:30.978 --> 01:33.378
You want to know what
you can do for me, Barry?

01:33.447 --> 01:34.980
You can let me go.

01:35.049 --> 01:36.314
Bassam...

01:40.287 --> 01:42.621
(indistinct chatter)

01:51.365 --> 01:53.398
WOMAN: Welcome to Dresden, General.

01:53.467 --> 01:54.778
You're here for the conference, I see.

01:54.802 --> 01:56.902
That's right. Two nights.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.003
First time in our city?

01:58.072 --> 01:59.171
It is.

01:59.239 --> 02:00.572
And I'm looking forward to being

02:00.641 --> 02:02.374
a tourist in-between terrorism panels.

02:02.443 --> 02:03.875
Just so you're aware,

02:03.944 --> 02:05.944
the opening dinner in
the Leibniz Ballroom

02:06.013 --> 02:08.312
has been moved to 9:00
p.m. to accommodate

02:08.382 --> 02:09.648
late-arriving guests.

02:09.717 --> 02:10.882
One key or two?

02:10.951 --> 02:12.718
Two, please.

02:12.786 --> 02:14.853
Have a wonderful stay.

02:14.922 --> 02:16.054
Thank you.

02:16.123 --> 02:17.556
Leila Al Fayeed.

02:17.624 --> 02:19.224
MAN: Welcome to Dresden, ma'am.

02:19.293 --> 02:22.027
Thank you.

02:25.432 --> 02:26.565
Where's Cogswell, General?

02:26.633 --> 02:28.300
I want to talk to you both.

02:28.368 --> 02:30.135
NATO Terrorism conference.

02:30.204 --> 02:33.205
Right, of course.

02:33.273 --> 02:34.706
General?

02:36.443 --> 02:37.709
I need to know

02:37.778 --> 02:39.878
if we're ready to
send our army into Syria.

02:39.947 --> 02:42.013
Sir, are you asking me if we're prepared

02:42.082 --> 02:44.382
to go to war today?

02:44.451 --> 02:46.017
That's what I'm asking.

02:47.287 --> 02:48.954
Yes.

02:49.022 --> 02:50.388
Good.

02:50.457 --> 02:52.190
I'm tired of waiting.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.459
We need Ihab to give us an excuse,

02:54.528 --> 02:55.861
any reason to march,

02:55.929 --> 02:58.096
and when it comes, we move.

03:04.538 --> 03:07.606
I have news I wanted to share with you.

03:07.674 --> 03:09.574
Okay.

03:09.643 --> 03:11.810
I volunteered

03:11.879 --> 03:14.479
to become a martyr.

03:14.548 --> 03:17.115
To bring jihad to their backyard.

03:20.187 --> 03:21.987
It's a great honor.

03:22.055 --> 03:24.122
To-to be a martyr.

03:24.191 --> 03:26.291
To go to paradise for our cause.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.993
I know.

03:28.061 --> 03:30.462
I hope to meet you there someday.

03:30.531 --> 03:33.965
That would be nice.

03:34.034 --> 03:36.868
Since we weren't destined to
share a path in this world,

03:36.937 --> 03:39.070
I would like to see you in the next.

04:08.435 --> 04:10.335
(birds chirping)

04:33.527 --> 04:35.794
Mom?

04:38.365 --> 04:40.232
Sammy.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.634
Mom.

04:44.404 --> 04:46.504
Oh, God.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.809
(sniffles) I missed you so much.

04:50.878 --> 04:52.811
Oh, me, too.

04:54.414 --> 04:55.614
Are you okay?

04:55.682 --> 04:58.083
I'm okay.

04:58.151 --> 04:59.445
So, the doctors, they...?

04:59.576 --> 05:00.952
- They were on board.
- Oh, okay.

05:01.021 --> 05:02.141
(laughs): I didn't run away.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.124
Molly?

05:07.294 --> 05:08.727
I'm home.

05:10.530 --> 05:12.264
(chuckles) I can see that.

05:12.332 --> 05:14.833
Uh... I had no idea.

05:14.902 --> 05:16.134
You-you said don't call.

05:16.203 --> 05:17.736
I didn't call. I know.

05:17.804 --> 05:18.804
You were so good.

05:18.839 --> 05:20.705
I-I, I know that was hard.

05:22.442 --> 05:25.877
Uh, I, I gave the house staff a warning.

05:25.946 --> 05:27.412
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

05:27.481 --> 05:29.247
I just, I never would've been able

05:29.316 --> 05:30.715
to answer all your questions.

05:30.784 --> 05:32.384
It doesn't matter now.

05:32.452 --> 05:34.052
(quiet laugh)

05:35.155 --> 05:37.088
You happy to see me?

05:41.295 --> 05:43.662
You have no idea.

05:52.005 --> 05:53.204
(phone chirps)

05:56.664 --> 06:00.187

06:12.392 --> 06:14.225
♪ ♪

06:26.373 --> 06:29.007

(doorbell rings)

06:33.680 --> 06:35.580
(music stops)

06:44.524 --> 06:46.725
I got one already.

06:46.793 --> 06:48.293
Two might be more than we need. Well,

06:48.362 --> 06:51.629
we're never gonna know unless we try.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.004
I like taking you to
bed in the afternoon

06:59.072 --> 07:02.240
in a country where no
one knows who we are.

07:02.309 --> 07:04.409
We don't have to hide.

07:07.381 --> 07:09.247
That's funny, I was just thinking...

07:10.817 --> 07:13.084
...we've done this so many times.

07:13.153 --> 07:15.520
Why is it so different this time?

07:17.090 --> 07:19.524
It's because this is
what normal people do.

07:20.894 --> 07:22.694
They take a holiday.

07:24.765 --> 07:27.432
A very short holiday.

07:27.501 --> 07:30.268
The real world is right
outside that window.

07:30.337 --> 07:31.803
A thousand miles more.

07:39.946 --> 07:41.846
Are you gonna come see my panel?

07:41.915 --> 07:43.348
Oh, well, that depends.

07:43.417 --> 07:44.849
Is it...

07:44.918 --> 07:46.951
Is it about what to do in
Dresden in the afternoon?

07:47.020 --> 07:48.453
Then, yeah.

07:48.522 --> 07:50.688
I believe it's
titled "Neighboring States

07:50.757 --> 07:53.158
and the Spreading
Infection of the Caliphate."

07:53.226 --> 07:56.127
That's just not funny.

07:56.196 --> 07:57.729
Oh, that hurts.

07:57.798 --> 07:59.998
That's what I was going for.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.236
I'm gonna come see your panel.

08:05.305 --> 08:08.773
So I know two months from
now what I have in store

08:08.842 --> 08:11.342
when I'm president.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.817
No comment.

08:18.885 --> 08:20.418
No comment?

08:20.487 --> 08:24.389
You are such a model of
discretion, aren't you?

08:24.458 --> 08:25.957
Yeah, well,

08:26.026 --> 08:29.060
you're the one that makes noise, not me.

08:31.998 --> 08:34.365
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

08:45.812 --> 08:47.679
You're a French national?

09:47.107 --> 09:48.439
Welcome to Germany.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.587
(knocking)

10:07.661 --> 10:09.994
Put it on.

10:14.434 --> 10:16.100
You can pass through a metal detector.

10:16.169 --> 10:18.303
Nothing will trigger.

10:18.371 --> 10:20.138
Okay.

10:20.207 --> 10:22.140
Once it is turned on,

10:22.209 --> 10:24.542
you detonate it by making a phone call.

10:24.611 --> 10:25.743
Any phone call.

10:25.812 --> 10:28.746
Press number, press call.

10:28.815 --> 10:30.615
We spent months preparing for this.

10:30.684 --> 10:33.451
Hundreds of people; important people.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.753
They're trusting you with this.

10:35.822 --> 10:37.789
MAN: You understand the plan,

10:37.857 --> 10:39.057
yes?

10:39.125 --> 10:40.825
Yes.

10:42.596 --> 10:44.229
I'm smart that way.

10:44.297 --> 10:47.098
I know it's a, uh,

10:47.167 --> 10:50.101
a big, general question.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.971
How are you?

10:53.039 --> 10:55.039
I'm better.

10:55.108 --> 10:57.575
Um... I'm different,

10:57.644 --> 11:01.379
but better.

11:01.448 --> 11:02.981
I don't want to die anymore.

11:03.049 --> 11:05.516
That feeling's gone.

11:05.585 --> 11:07.619
That's good.

11:07.687 --> 11:10.088
Yeah.

11:10.156 --> 11:11.656
When I was alone

11:11.725 --> 11:14.192
away from this place,

11:14.261 --> 11:17.495
I figured some things out.

11:18.331 --> 11:20.665
All of those children.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.637
It was...

11:25.705 --> 11:27.105
whatever you want to call it...

11:27.173 --> 11:30.541
A-a loss of innocence?

11:30.610 --> 11:33.811
I mourn that.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.747
Not as much as I mourned Emma,

11:35.815 --> 11:38.383
but still,

11:38.451 --> 11:40.051
a loss of me.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.388
Of course.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.089
But it's useless.

11:45.158 --> 11:47.225
I have blood on my hands now

11:47.294 --> 11:49.994
that I can never wash off.

11:50.063 --> 11:52.797
No amount of feeling
guilty can change that.

11:58.171 --> 12:00.738
I'm of this place now, Barry.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.909
I'm stained by the ugliness

12:04.978 --> 12:07.312
of this place.

12:09.983 --> 12:11.983
So...

12:12.052 --> 12:15.653
that's how it is.

12:15.722 --> 12:19.257
Fine, I'm not gonna lose another
night's sleep over it.

12:22.228 --> 12:23.995
Right.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.400
All I care about is finishing the job.

12:29.469 --> 12:31.903
You understand?

12:31.971 --> 12:33.604
Ihab is still alive.

12:37.811 --> 12:39.644
We killed the sheik, but... But

12:39.713 --> 12:42.814
Ihab is still alive months later.

12:46.319 --> 12:49.721
I'm going to war to fix that.

12:49.789 --> 12:53.224
We are going to war for our daughter.

12:53.293 --> 12:56.060
And everything else we
stayed here to accomplish.

12:56.129 --> 12:57.695
Exactly.

12:57.764 --> 13:00.965
Exactly.

13:03.468 --> 13:05.460
I'm done with forgiveness.

I had no idea she was
coming back. I, um...

14:21.397 --> 14:23.231
I hadn't heard a word from
her since she left.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.566
Molly.

14:27.136 --> 14:29.704
You can call her by her name.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.372
Molly.

14:31.441 --> 14:32.807
Your wife.

14:33.943 --> 14:36.043
Molly.

14:36.112 --> 14:38.079
My wife.

14:43.353 --> 14:44.552
I can't...

14:44.621 --> 14:46.921
You can't what, leave her?

14:48.825 --> 14:50.725
Of course you can't.

14:53.196 --> 14:56.230
I didn't fall into your
bed to end your marriage.

14:58.101 --> 15:01.235
I did it because I thought
your marriage might be over.

15:01.304 --> 15:04.272
I hoped so.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.907
Isn't that awful?

15:06.976 --> 15:08.142
No.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.577
I don't think it is.

15:09.646 --> 15:11.245
Of course it is.

15:11.314 --> 15:14.081
This is the right thing.

15:14.150 --> 15:18.886
And what you and I did while
your wife was gone...

15:18.955 --> 15:20.521
was not.

15:24.661 --> 15:26.560
I love you.

15:28.665 --> 15:30.564
Oh, I love you, too.

15:45.682 --> 15:48.249
Good-bye, dearest.

16:00.675 --> 16:02.274
Last time.

16:18.881 --> 16:21.515
I'm so sorry.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.749
Why?

16:22.818 --> 16:25.952
For what?

16:26.021 --> 16:28.388
For wanting to die.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.449
You don't have to apologize.

16:33.349 --> 16:35.762
- Everyone understands.
- No, I do.

16:35.831 --> 16:38.198
I owe you an apology, you.

16:38.267 --> 16:44.004
I behaved like being your
mother wasn't enough.

16:44.507 --> 16:45.873
And it is.

All they have to do is keep
you from defeating them.

29:42.692 --> 29:45.259
They're going to draw you in,
they're going to wear you out,

29:45.328 --> 29:47.762

you to fight block by block,

29:47.830 --> 29:50.998

me in a year and tell me

29:51.067 --> 29:53.768

30:05.715 --> 30:07.615
Costly stalemates usually aren't

30:07.683 --> 30:10.618
the stepping stones to greatness.

30:16.025 --> 30:17.424
Are you denying my authority?

30:17.493 --> 30:19.593
You're an interim unelected president.

30:19.662 --> 30:21.395
Yes, I'm denying your authority

month of presidency, Bassam.

last day, if I have to.

30:35.444 --> 30:38.579
Everything he's done
is-is to this purpose.

30:38.648 --> 30:40.347
He's goading you to attack him.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.249
I know that.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.351
But wanting war doesn't
keep him safe from me.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.021
We both want the same thing,
so war is what he's gonna get.

30:47.089 --> 30:48.222
Bassam, for God's sake,

30:48.291 --> 30:49.890
we're a small country.

30:49.959 --> 30:52.259
And this is the whole world's fight.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.562
Even if we have the United
States at our side,

30:54.630 --> 30:56.510
we don't have the power

30:56.566 --> 30:58.532
And there will always be more.

31:07.710 --> 31:09.944
Jamal was right. Tariq was right.

31:10.012 --> 31:11.712
If you let these people live,

31:11.781 --> 31:13.747
they come back to kill
you tomorrow, and they did.

31:13.816 --> 31:16.016
They killed my daughter.

31:18.187 --> 31:20.821
I'm gonna wipe them out.

31:20.890 --> 31:23.924
Every last one. And if
you wouldn't have the courage

31:23.993 --> 31:25.637
to pull the trigger
yourself, then it's a good thing

31:25.661 --> 31:28.929
it's my job and not
yours. And as for this man...

31:28.998 --> 31:31.565
You're confusing wisdom with treason.

31:33.336 --> 31:36.303
I'm about to send our
troops into harm's way.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.640
Our men, our boys.

31:39.709 --> 31:43.143
Be very careful what you say
against me, against the cause

31:43.212 --> 31:44.590
for which some of them are gonna die,

31:44.614 --> 31:46.447
because I will not hesitate

31:46.515 --> 31:48.515
to call you out for
giving comfort to the enemy,

31:48.584 --> 31:51.285
and that's treason, Sheik Al-Qadi.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.066
LEILA: <i>President Bassam Al Fayeed</i>

32:10.091 --> 32:12.358
<i>is our interim president.</i>

32:12.554 --> 32:15.188
He's in office solely to transition

32:15.257 --> 32:18.858
to a democratically
chosen leader of Abuddin.

32:18.927 --> 32:22.128
As such, he has no constitutional

32:22.197 --> 32:24.030
or moral authority

32:24.099 --> 32:26.466
to take our country to war.

32:26.535 --> 32:29.002
I want to be very clear.

32:29.071 --> 32:32.238
I believe the Caliphate
is evil and our enemy.

32:34.576 --> 32:37.577
If I'm elected your president,

32:37.646 --> 32:41.381
I will immediately withdraw our troops

32:41.450 --> 32:44.317
from a war we should not be fighting.

32:46.288 --> 32:49.622
That I do not believe we can win.

32:52.027 --> 32:54.260
(cheering)

33:00.769 --> 33:02.970
What exactly is it that
you're asking, sir?

33:02.995 --> 33:03.728
How long?

33:03.772 --> 33:05.839
I'm asking you how long it will take.

33:05.907 --> 33:07.505
To finish?

33:07.670 --> 33:09.136
Well, you know I can't answer that.

33:10.579 --> 33:11.711
General?

33:13.248 --> 33:15.348
It's not a month, not two, not three,

33:15.417 --> 33:16.683
even if we move tomorrow.

33:18.653 --> 33:20.420
Okay, what happens in
the first six weeks?

33:20.489 --> 33:22.722
Will we have victories by then?

33:22.791 --> 33:24.691
Will we have enough
success to prove them wrong?

33:24.760 --> 33:26.760
To make it politically impossible

33:26.828 --> 33:28.573
for the next president
to withdraw our troops?

33:28.597 --> 33:32.098
Some victories, maybe.
Maybe some defeats.

33:32.167 --> 33:34.634
But where the war will be
when you leave office,

33:34.703 --> 33:36.936
whether your troops will
be on the offensive

33:37.005 --> 33:40.507
or bogged down... Impossible to say.

33:40.575 --> 33:43.309
MALOOF: Leila Al Fayeed
has given them a strategy.

33:43.378 --> 33:44.522
The Caliphate won't engage with us

33:44.546 --> 33:45.823
unless they have the upper hand.

33:45.847 --> 33:47.680
They have no reason to take chances.

33:47.749 --> 33:49.382
All they need to do now

33:49.451 --> 33:50.750
is wait six weeks.

33:53.955 --> 33:55.688
Mr. President,

33:55.757 --> 33:58.558
I know you don't want to
hear this, but as a soldier,

33:58.627 --> 34:01.494
I have to tell you that it
would be dangerous and reckless

34:01.563 --> 34:04.197
to send men to die in a war that
will only end in retreat.

34:04.266 --> 34:06.766
That is not courage in the face of odds.

34:06.835 --> 34:09.101
That's murder.

34:13.341 --> 34:15.208
I need to go to sleep, I'm tired.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.946
- Molly...
- What?

34:20.014 --> 34:21.947
Is there something you
need to hear from me

34:22.016 --> 34:23.149
that you don't already know?

34:23.217 --> 34:25.251
There was no way I could've known,

34:25.320 --> 34:27.954
when I made the decision,
that I would have this job to do,

34:28.023 --> 34:29.589
and that I would run out of time.

34:29.658 --> 34:32.091
- We always said...
- Not we... you.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.927
You always said.

34:33.995 --> 34:36.896
Your intellectual,

34:36.965 --> 34:39.399
ideological fucking hedge.

34:39.467 --> 34:42.569
I want democracy in
Abuddin, but it can't be me.

34:42.637 --> 34:45.338
You can vote, but
not for me. An Al Fayeed

34:45.407 --> 34:46.906
can't replace an Al Fayeed.

34:46.975 --> 34:48.842
You know what the joke is?

34:48.909 --> 34:52.212
An Al Fayeed is still
gonna be the next president,

34:52.280 --> 34:54.112
and it's not gonna be you.

34:57.552 --> 34:59.385
The people would've...

34:59.454 --> 35:02.222
elected you in a minute.

35:02.290 --> 35:04.224
Everything you did.

35:05.927 --> 35:09.696
Truth and reconciliation?

35:09.764 --> 35:11.598
Jesus Christ, what a farce.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.302
You want to do a job,

35:16.371 --> 35:19.239
do it yourself, Barry.

35:19.307 --> 35:21.841
Don't leave it for someone else.

35:21.910 --> 35:24.310
You want to kill the man who
murdered your daughter?

35:24.379 --> 35:27.647
You have to do it yourself.

35:33.154 --> 35:35.755
You've seen the polls.

35:35.824 --> 35:38.258
She's gonna be the next president.

35:40.428 --> 35:42.195
I can't make a war in a month,

35:42.264 --> 35:45.031
and I cannot send our
troops in to die for nothing.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.166
Right.

35:47.235 --> 35:50.370
So I spend the next six
weeks bombing Caliphate territory.

35:50.438 --> 35:53.573
But how many more innocent
people will die?

35:53.642 --> 35:55.642
How many more children?

35:55.710 --> 35:59.546
I don't see those children's
faces anymore.

35:59.614 --> 36:01.814
I just see hers.

36:01.883 --> 36:03.449
Emma's.

36:03.518 --> 36:07.186
In a constant loop inside my head.

36:07.255 --> 36:09.155
"Mommy," she said.

36:10.725 --> 36:12.992
"Mommy, help me."

36:13.061 --> 36:15.028
But I can't.

36:15.096 --> 36:17.030
I can't.

36:21.469 --> 36:23.403
That's Daddy's job.

36:36.151 --> 36:38.051
(footsteps approaching)

36:54.970 --> 36:57.203
BARRY: <i>Citizens of Abuddin,</i>

36:57.272 --> 36:59.706
no one is a greater
champion of democracy

36:59.774 --> 37:01.341
than I am.

37:01.409 --> 37:03.810
The right of the people
to decide their own fate

37:03.878 --> 37:06.746
was at the heart of our revolution.

37:06.815 --> 37:10.249
But democracy is not something
we can simply will into being

37:10.318 --> 37:12.051
while we hope for the best.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.953
It has to be fought for.

37:14.022 --> 37:15.254
Sometimes died for,

37:15.323 --> 37:16.956
as so many did when the Caliphate

37:17.025 --> 37:18.257
was driven from our territory,

37:18.326 --> 37:20.593
and the old regime was ended.

37:20.662 --> 37:24.097
I look forward to elections in Abuddin.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.800
But now is not the time.

37:27.869 --> 37:30.580
First there is a job to be done.

37:30.605 --> 37:33.506
To rid ourselves of a persistent
enemy at our borders

37:33.575 --> 37:36.209
who is determined to see us fail.

37:36.277 --> 37:39.012
Once they have been
defeated, and only then,

37:39.080 --> 37:42.315
can we safely hope for our
young democracy to survive.

37:44.552 --> 37:47.620
I am, therefore, postponing...
Not cancelling...

37:47.689 --> 37:50.356
But postponing our
presidential elections

37:50.425 --> 37:52.125
until we can be certain

37:52.193 --> 37:53.693
that the so-called Caliphate

37:53.762 --> 37:56.562
has been destroyed once and for all.

38:06.107 --> 38:07.440
Madam?

38:12.047 --> 38:15.415
I told you, remember?

38:15.483 --> 38:19.118
That he would turn out to be
the same as the rest of them.

38:19.187 --> 38:20.753
Not better.

38:22.424 --> 38:24.757
You did.

38:24.826 --> 38:26.659
I'm sorry.

38:26.728 --> 38:29.729
For what?

38:29.798 --> 38:32.630
I'm going to be president.

38:42.585 --> 38:44.916
Bassam.

38:44.954 --> 38:46.854
I need to see you.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.677
And I know that's not okay,

38:51.702 --> 38:53.168
not anymore.

38:53.193 --> 38:55.496
But I have to talk to you.

38:55.965 --> 38:57.931
You told me that you trusted me

38:58.000 --> 38:59.700
more than anyone.

38:59.768 --> 39:02.169
You have to trust me on this.

39:02.238 --> 39:04.838
You can't do this.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.974
You can't.

39:07.042 --> 39:09.643
I know how much pressure you're under.

39:09.712 --> 39:13.013
How much it hurts.

39:13.082 --> 39:16.617
But this undoes everything.

39:18.687 --> 39:22.489
And I can't... I can't
be silent if you...

39:26.962 --> 39:30.230
Please, call me back.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.667
Please.

39:34.970 --> 39:37.371
(beep)

39:37.439 --> 39:39.706
(sighs)

39:41.605 --> 39:43.485
SIDDIQ: <i>I came all the way from Ma'an.</i>

39:43.510 --> 39:45.078
I would like to see him.

39:45.147 --> 39:47.096
I'm afraid that's not
possible at the moment.

39:47.121 --> 39:49.394
- Are you protecting him? Is that it?
- FAUZI: I'll see myself out.

39:49.418 --> 39:50.584
Did you see him?

39:50.653 --> 39:52.352
No.

39:52.421 --> 39:54.502
He's busy. In meetings.

39:54.527 --> 39:57.500
For you, too? I can't
seem to get past this man.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.492
Why don't we just wait
here? The two of us.

39:59.517 --> 40:01.273
We'll wait as long as is necessary.

40:01.297 --> 40:03.078
I can't let you do that.

40:03.103 --> 40:04.598
Unless you have an appointment.

40:04.667 --> 40:06.433
I'm Bassam's oldest friend.

40:06.502 --> 40:08.250
And this man here,

40:08.275 --> 40:10.237
he was at his side, his right hand,

40:10.306 --> 40:12.117
- throughout the revolution.
- Are you really going

40:12.141 --> 40:13.407
to turn us away?

40:14.217 --> 40:15.623
Today? Yes.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.547
The problem of Abuddin

40:20.616 --> 40:23.550
is not across our borders.

40:23.619 --> 40:26.820
It's right here at home.

40:26.889 --> 40:29.356
It's the corrupting influence of power.

40:29.425 --> 40:31.892
And it infects all of
those who take up residence

40:31.961 --> 40:35.662
in that isolated, golden palace.

40:35.731 --> 40:38.165
First Khaled Al Fayeed.

40:38.233 --> 40:40.734
Then Jamal Al Fayeed.

40:40.803 --> 40:43.637
And now President Bassam Al Fayeed.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.275
I am no longer an Al Fayeed.

40:49.678 --> 40:52.312
I am Leila Haddad.

40:52.381 --> 40:54.882
And if I am elected president, I will

40:54.907 --> 40:58.919
shut down that palace and turn
it back to a people's park.

40:58.988 --> 41:02.503
And the president of
Abuddin will live right here,

41:02.528 --> 41:05.428
in a humble home. With you.

41:05.694 --> 41:07.627
Among you.

41:07.696 --> 41:09.796
For you.

41:09.865 --> 41:12.908
Exley, it's Cogswell. Listen,

41:12.933 --> 41:14.689
until I get orders to the contrary,

41:14.714 --> 41:16.603
I am still preparing Bassam's army

41:16.628 --> 41:18.323
for the ground war in Syria.

41:18.348 --> 41:20.517
I had believed he had
support for this war

41:20.542 --> 41:22.509
until yesterday.

41:22.578 --> 41:26.279
But things are about
to get ugly in Abuddin.

41:26.348 --> 41:29.683
So I suggest you get on
the next plane out here.

41:29.752 --> 41:32.486
...have a future worth fighting for.

41:32.554 --> 41:36.823
Raise doctors and engineers,

41:36.892 --> 41:41.461
scientists and poets.

41:41.530 --> 41:45.799
The path to paradise is here.

41:45.868 --> 41:48.135
You tell 'em.

41:48.203 --> 41:50.504
(indistinct chatter)

41:54.843 --> 41:56.009
(beep)

41:56.078 --> 41:58.445
(line ringing)

42:00.315 --> 42:03.245
FEMALE VOICE: You have no new messages.

42:07.056 --> 42:09.389
(beep)

42:10.376 --> 42:13.026
We cannot claim to come to terms

42:13.095 --> 42:15.074
with the sins of our past

42:15.099 --> 42:19.566
at the same time as we are
intent on repeating them.

42:19.591 --> 42:23.637
The promise of the
revolution was the promise

42:23.705 --> 42:26.502
that the people's voice would be heard.

42:26.527 --> 42:28.908
Not just when it is convenient.

42:28.933 --> 42:33.213
Not only when those
in power agree with it.

42:33.282 --> 42:35.115
Always.

42:35.184 --> 42:38.543
Democracy is not a sometimes thing.

42:38.568 --> 42:41.288
It is important that
these words are repeated,

42:41.356 --> 42:43.523
again and again,

42:43.592 --> 42:45.926
until they ring out not
just in the streets

42:45.994 --> 42:47.761
but in the palace itself,

42:47.830 --> 42:50.609
that the promise of the revolution
was the promise that

42:50.634 --> 42:52.868
people's voice will be heard.

42:53.046 --> 42:55.073
So said Daliyah Al-Yazbek,

42:55.098 --> 42:56.965
the great heroine of our revolution,

42:56.990 --> 42:59.191
the mother of our democracy.

42:59.216 --> 43:01.517
Not just when it is convenient.

43:01.542 --> 43:04.324
Not only when those
in power agree with it.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.637
Always.

43:06.910 --> 43:10.405
Democracy is not a sometimes thing.

43:10.430 --> 43:13.565
Not only when those
in power agree with it.

43:14.232 --> 43:16.131
Always.

43:40.725 --> 43:42.489
DALIYAH: <i>Whatever you have to say to me,</i>

43:42.514 --> 43:45.184
you should be saying
to the whole country.

43:46.364 --> 43:48.499
This is not between you and me.

43:48.524 --> 43:49.723
It is

43:49.748 --> 43:51.348
between you and me.

43:53.053 --> 43:55.704
You have to stop
speaking out against me.

43:58.109 --> 43:59.477
Daliyah.

43:59.502 --> 44:02.211
- You have no right to ask me that.
- Daliyah,

44:02.236 --> 44:03.936
this is me.

44:04.382 --> 44:07.016
What's that supposed to mean?

44:08.009 --> 44:10.543
Do I owe you something?

44:10.619 --> 44:12.666
Because I slept with you?

44:13.549 --> 44:15.430
- Because I love you?
- No, of course not...

44:15.455 --> 44:18.158
I pleaded with you
not to give me this power.

44:18.183 --> 44:19.924
Right here, in this room.

44:19.949 --> 44:22.201
I told you I was afraid.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.492
I begged you.

44:23.517 --> 44:24.802
But you said no.

44:24.827 --> 44:26.660
You insisted.

44:26.685 --> 44:28.941
- Why did you have to go...
- Daliyah, it doesn't matter.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.327
You don't have to do this.

44:30.352 --> 44:32.843
This is not the business
of The Truth and Dignity Commission.

44:32.868 --> 44:33.900
This is politics.

44:33.925 --> 44:36.412
The crimes of the last 25 years

44:36.480 --> 44:39.036
include the crimes of yesterday...

44:39.061 --> 44:40.489
and of an hour ago.

44:40.514 --> 44:42.192
- You think this is a crime?
- It is a crime.

44:42.217 --> 44:44.651
My daughter's death is a crime.

44:45.356 --> 44:47.323
Of a different kind.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.095
I'm sorry if that upsets you.

44:55.223 --> 44:57.256
But you gave me a voice,

44:57.614 --> 44:59.347
and I have to use it.

45:00.338 --> 45:02.228
If I don't, then who am I?

45:02.253 --> 45:03.519
I'm nothing.

45:03.544 --> 45:05.596
I'm less than you are.

45:06.468 --> 45:08.814
You're doing what
you believe in, at least.

45:14.984 --> 45:16.350
You should go.

45:19.715 --> 45:22.048
I need you to go.

45:30.783 --> 45:32.416
I love you.

45:35.142 --> 45:38.110
How does that matter now?

45:38.366 --> 45:41.400
What does it have to do with anything?

45:43.434 --> 45:44.567
Anyway,

45:45.603 --> 45:47.095
you're married, so.

45:52.430 --> 45:55.134
You are the closest
person in the world to me.

45:55.159 --> 45:58.227
I love nothing else the
way that I love you.

45:59.749 --> 46:00.881
I'm begging you.

46:01.365 --> 46:03.042
You said your piece.

46:03.067 --> 46:04.967
You did your job.

46:06.981 --> 46:08.714
But stay silent now.

46:36.266 --> 46:37.806
Call me as the first witness.

46:37.830 --> 46:39.029
I'll testify.

46:47.306 --> 46:48.438
Are you afraid?

46:48.507 --> 46:50.707
No. I'm heartbroken.

46:54.346 --> 46:56.480
Thank you.

47:01.053 --> 47:03.754
Okay.

47:12.164 --> 47:13.630
Close the doors.

47:35.621 --> 47:39.189
There are troops
stationed outside this room,

47:39.258 --> 47:42.693
outside those doors.

47:42.761 --> 47:45.095
I wish I could say that they are here

47:45.164 --> 47:49.833
to protect us, and our right to speak,

47:49.902 --> 47:53.837
but they are not.

47:53.906 --> 47:57.474
They are here to
intimidate us from speaking.

47:57.543 --> 47:59.743
To remind us that,

47:59.812 --> 48:01.845
at least in the short run,

48:01.914 --> 48:09.019
a bullet can silence a voice.

48:09.088 --> 48:11.822
But they will not succeed.

48:11.890 --> 48:16.093
The Truth and Dignity Commission
has always been about bravery,

48:16.161 --> 48:17.995
about facing the facts about ourselves

48:18.063 --> 48:19.543
- with courage and...
- (door opening)

48:22.468 --> 48:25.168
(soldiers footsteps)

48:26.939 --> 48:28.505
Shame on you.

48:28.574 --> 48:30.240
This is the people's meeting.

48:30.309 --> 48:31.453
The Truth and Dignity Commission

48:31.477 --> 48:32.609
has been disbanded.

48:32.678 --> 48:34.344
On order of the President,

48:34.413 --> 48:37.047
this meeting is over.

48:37.116 --> 48:38.448
(crowd exclaiming)

48:38.517 --> 48:40.250
SOLDIER: Get up.

48:40.319 --> 48:41.952
SOLDIER: Get out.

48:42.021 --> 48:43.887
SOLDIER: Get up.

48:47.926 --> 48:49.693
Just-just step aside.

48:49.762 --> 48:51.695
Let's not make a scene.

48:51.764 --> 48:53.263
Ahmed, what are you doing?

48:53.332 --> 48:55.032
I'm going in there to see my parents.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.801
- They're in a meeting with General Cogswell.
- So what?

48:57.870 --> 49:00.604
What, you're their errand
boy now, just watching the door?

49:00.673 --> 49:03.140
Have you not heard what's going on?

49:03.208 --> 49:05.876
What he did at the Truth and
Dignity Commission today?

49:05.944 --> 49:08.278
Yes.

49:08.347 --> 49:10.113
Yes. Yes.

49:10.182 --> 49:11.882
That's all you have to say?

49:11.950 --> 49:15.585
Listen, they've lost their
minds in there, out of grief.

49:15.654 --> 49:17.621
And they won't listen to anyone

49:17.690 --> 49:19.690
except people who tell
them what they want to hear.

49:19.725 --> 49:22.192
So, someone has to wake them
up and tell them the truth.

49:22.261 --> 49:24.795
They're doing what has to be done, okay?

49:24.863 --> 49:26.363
And you're not helping.

49:26.432 --> 49:28.932
You should go. Go away, calm down.

49:32.037 --> 49:33.870
Who are you to say that to me?

49:33.939 --> 49:36.873
You're just some junior
officer in the army.

49:38.444 --> 49:42.179
We have a lot to talk about, you and me.

49:42.247 --> 49:44.147
MALOOF: <i>I'm not concerned.</i>

49:44.216 --> 49:46.061
The people of Abuddin are
used to the government

49:46.085 --> 49:49.286
telling them what to
do. The anger will pass.

49:49.354 --> 49:50.821
Pretty soon it'll feel like

49:50.889 --> 49:52.823
the same old normal.

49:52.891 --> 49:55.892
MOLLY: Once the war is over...
in six months or a year...

49:55.961 --> 49:57.739
Once you've declared elections
again, this will all

49:57.763 --> 49:59.429
be remembered as nothing
more than a blip.

50:06.105 --> 50:08.438
General Maloof, your orders.

50:10.142 --> 50:12.909
With Cogswell's
support, your army is instructed

50:12.978 --> 50:16.880
to do everything
necessary to maintain the peace.

50:16.949 --> 50:20.117
There is now a curfew in place in Ma'an.

50:20.185 --> 50:22.652
Mr. President.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.926
(indistinct conversations)

50:39.104 --> 50:40.344
You are in violation of curfew!

50:40.372 --> 50:42.305
(shouting)

50:43.609 --> 50:44.609
Run! Run!

50:45.744 --> 50:46.744
Return to your homes!

50:50.315 --> 50:51.809
Off the streets now!

50:51.941 --> 50:53.784
(screaming)

50:55.754 --> 50:56.914
We have the right to be here!

51:11.069 --> 51:13.570
We have to be very careful.

51:13.639 --> 51:15.806
More careful than before.

51:15.874 --> 51:17.941
This is a dangerous time.

51:18.010 --> 51:19.910
I understand that.

51:22.414 --> 51:24.214
And we shouldn't do this again.

51:26.285 --> 51:28.451
Meet. Here.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.754
Not until this passes.

51:30.823 --> 51:33.490
If it ever passes.

51:35.828 --> 51:38.261
I just need to know what side you're on.

51:38.330 --> 51:40.864
Oh, please don't ask me that.

51:40.933 --> 51:43.733
I am asking.

51:43.802 --> 51:46.403
I am an officer of the
United States government.

51:46.471 --> 51:49.005
I have no private point of view.

51:49.074 --> 51:52.342
I take orders.

51:52.411 --> 51:56.279
And, at the moment, until
something changes...

51:56.348 --> 51:59.883
I'm here to support the
president of Abuddin.

52:02.654 --> 52:04.921
Right.

52:07.359 --> 52:09.259
It's not personal.

52:15.968 --> 52:18.668
(door opens, closes)

52:18.737 --> 52:22.138
Play it back for me again.

52:22.207 --> 52:25.175
IHAB: The American
president of Abuddin has declared

52:25.244 --> 52:28.111
his intention to make
war on the Caliphate.

52:28.180 --> 52:30.847
When he and his army of unbelievers

52:30.916 --> 52:32.716
invade Muslim soil,

52:32.784 --> 52:35.085
we will be ready.

52:35.153 --> 52:37.087
Until then, he seems content

52:37.155 --> 52:39.923
to make war on his own people.

52:43.328 --> 52:45.672
God has been good to us today.
