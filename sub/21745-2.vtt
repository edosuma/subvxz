00:01.102 --> 00:02.670
I don't get
what your problem is.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.338
Mom, you're not serious,
are you?

00:04.372 --> 00:06.507
Mom, you still have to
take me to Chloe's house
on Saturday.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.142
Mom, this is
child abandonment.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.678
We're like orphans now!
(door slams)

00:13.013 --> 00:16.284
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.396
Everything bagel
and cream cheese, black coffee.

00:30.631 --> 00:34.368
* Are you my love?
Hey.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.570
* Are you my love?

00:36.604 --> 00:39.707
* Are you the one
that I've been thinking of? *

00:39.740 --> 00:42.343
* Are you my love?

00:42.376 --> 00:45.413
* I've been holding the door

00:45.446 --> 00:47.948
* I've been holding
the door *

00:47.981 --> 00:51.419
* Are you the one
that I've been waiting for? *

00:51.452 --> 00:54.388
* I've been holding the door

00:54.422 --> 00:56.390
* Lightning struck

00:56.424 --> 01:00.060
* Electricity rained

01:00.094 --> 01:02.062
* How my lips stung

01:02.096 --> 01:05.699
* Whispering your name

01:05.733 --> 01:11.872
* Tell me, baby, true

01:11.905 --> 01:14.108
* I've been holding the door

01:14.142 --> 01:15.776
* I've been holding
the door *

01:15.809 --> 01:17.411
Aw, hey, dog.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.648
* Are you the one that
I've been waiting for? *

01:20.681 --> 01:24.051
* I've been holding the door

01:24.084 --> 01:25.586
* Are you my love?

01:25.619 --> 01:29.223
* Are you my love?
Bup!

01:29.257 --> 01:32.092
* Are you the one
that I've been dreaming of? *

01:32.126 --> 01:35.329
* Are you my love?

01:35.363 --> 01:38.599
(coughing)
Jesus.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.634
(Г  la Dolores O'Riordan):
* With their tanks

01:40.668 --> 01:42.436
* And their bombs,
and their bombs *

01:42.470 --> 01:44.505
* And their guns, in your head

01:44.538 --> 01:47.475
* In your head you're crying

01:47.508 --> 01:51.345
* In their head,
in your head *

01:51.379 --> 01:53.414
* Zombie, zombie

01:53.447 --> 01:56.284
* Zombie-ie-ie-ie.

01:56.317 --> 02:00.120
Linds, I discovered this
awesome radio station!

02:00.154 --> 02:03.157
Jack FM-- it is not your
father's rock station.

02:03.191 --> 02:06.360
You see, Jack just plays
whatever he wants.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.596
They have this great '90s block

02:08.629 --> 02:10.664
I've gotten really into.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.667
What a great decade for music.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.271
We were so lucky!

02:17.305 --> 02:19.006
(toilet flushes)
Anyway...

02:19.039 --> 02:20.508
How was your day?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.609
So good.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.277
I love my job.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.045
That's so great.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.947
Watch me.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.383
It's like having people
expect you to be somewhere

02:29.417 --> 02:31.619
actually makes you
want to go there.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.354
Plus, I get money.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.822
Awesome.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.892
Look, I put beads
in my hair.
Hmm.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.861
You should use it at work.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.296
"Teenage white girl
on vacation"

02:42.330 --> 02:43.797
is gonna be huge this year.

02:43.831 --> 02:47.000
I'm finally contributing
to society.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.836
By being a stylist's assistant?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.671
Helping make people
less ugly?

02:50.704 --> 02:53.674
It's God's work, Gretch.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.042
This is the tits!

02:55.075 --> 02:57.478
I'm playing with clothes
during the day, and then

02:57.511 --> 03:00.214
I come home, and you're
here, and Paul isn't.

03:00.248 --> 03:03.150
I love my new life.

03:03.183 --> 03:07.421
Yeah, but... I don't know.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.157
What?
I love it, too.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.327
But... we're doing
the same thing every night.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.596
You know, drinking,
smoking weed.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.031
I'm afraid we might
be in a rut.

03:18.065 --> 03:22.370
Okay, well, we can
go out in the hood.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.171
Get Korean barbecue,
and then go to one

03:24.204 --> 03:27.040
of those karaoke places where
they don't like white people.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.509
I have a better idea.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.943
Why don't we stay here
and smoke crack?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.181
Where did you get crack?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.949
From one of the
homeless people outside.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.685
I didn't even have
to leave the apartment.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
He just came to the window
and asked

03:38.919 --> 03:41.188
if I wanted to buy some crack,
and I said yes!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.891
Ten dollars for all that crack.
Can you believe it?

03:43.924 --> 03:46.794
Maybe smoking crack
isn't the best idea.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.763
The guy who sold it to me
couldn't disagree more.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.839
*

04:01.775 --> 04:04.578
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

04:04.612 --> 04:07.315
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

04:07.348 --> 04:10.651
* Gonna leave you anyway.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.625
WOMAN: Lindsay, did you get
those swatches from Antwerp?

04:17.658 --> 04:21.395
Hello?
Lindsay?

04:21.429 --> 04:24.998
Can I see you
in my office?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.269
Lindsay, I wanted to...

04:29.303 --> 04:30.804
I smoked crack.
What?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.675
Thank you for
this opportunity.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.243
I'm sorry
I let you down.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.445
Lindsay, sit.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.581
You've been here
on a trial basis

04:40.614 --> 04:42.983
for over a month now.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.685
Are you enjoying yourself?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.754
So much.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.256
It's the dream
I didn't know I had.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.359
I feel like I found
a family here.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.293
Plus, the free food
is a nice perk.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.628
We don't have free food.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.997
Anyway, how would you like
to come work

04:57.030 --> 04:58.265
for me full-time?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.535
What?! Yes!

05:01.569 --> 05:04.271
I mean, I might be
amenable to that.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.874
Do you have a piece of paper
on which I should write

05:06.907 --> 05:08.542
my opening salary offer?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.178
(laughs)

05:11.211 --> 05:12.513
You're funny.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.147
You have got
a great eye,

05:14.181 --> 05:17.217
and you're the most
positive person we've ever had.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.587
I really value you,
Lindsay.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.291
Okay, well, you'll start
at a base of $45K,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.727
plus commission
on any new clients

05:26.760 --> 05:28.696
you bring in.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.698
Now that you're out of
your probationary period,

05:30.731 --> 05:32.366
the real work begins.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.568
You don't have to do any more
of those dummy chores.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.269
Carl can do all that crap.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.544
I want you to start thinking
like a designer.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.312
Read these.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.880
They're a good start
for understanding

05:46.914 --> 05:49.550
my style, philosophy
and influences,

05:49.583 --> 05:53.020
and probably the origins
of my body dysmorphia.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.088
Why I eat ice for lunch.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.057
(nervous laugh)

05:57.090 --> 06:00.093
Then come back tonight
at 7:00, and we begin.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.529
Tonight?

06:01.562 --> 06:04.865
But... work is for day.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.401
Honey, making people look good

06:07.435 --> 06:09.236
is a 24-hour job.

06:09.269 --> 06:13.373
We have to dress an actor for
Jaden Smith's retirement party.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.577
Sorry.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.945
Thanks, Priscilla.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.047
(Lindsay sighs)

06:29.256 --> 06:31.291
Shove it up your ass, Carl.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.927
Okay.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.735
Hi. Hi.
Hello.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.571
How was work?
I had a great day.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.540
The Price Is Right had Plinko,
which they never do.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.109
I made a chocolate
mug cake.

06:49.142 --> 06:53.413
Also, I started a really cool
dinosaur mural on your wall.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.550
Anyway,

06:56.584 --> 06:59.286
tonight I made a pitcher
of greyhounds

06:59.319 --> 07:01.889
with that bag of grapefruits
that you thought were limes.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.291
Postmates is bringing us
Taco Bell as we speak.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.593
I think I have
a little crack left.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.594
(laughs)

07:06.627 --> 07:07.761
I can't hang out tonight.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.797
I have to be back
at work at 7:00.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.264
But work is for day.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.933
That's what I said.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.502
Oh, well, at least until then,

07:14.535 --> 07:15.836
we can get down
with our chalupas

07:15.869 --> 07:16.904
and watch Fixer Upper.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.238
We drink every time Joanna says,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.674
"Shiplap!" That Chip
can get it, huh?

07:20.708 --> 07:23.176
He can get it
all the way, I think.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.178
Actually, I have a whole bunch
of reading to do.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.413
Oh, ha-ha.
"I should really

07:26.446 --> 07:27.681
"get started on those sit-ups

07:27.715 --> 07:29.783
if I want to finish in time
to catch the news."

07:29.817 --> 07:31.451
Actually, I really need
to concentrate,

07:31.485 --> 07:34.287
so maybe you could clear out
for, like, an hour or two?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.194
Are you okay?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.030
Yeah, no, it's just, um,

07:43.063 --> 07:46.199
I'm not really going
outside these days.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.200
What do you mean?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.336
I haven't left your apartment.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.438
Since when?
Um...

07:51.471 --> 07:54.207
three months, two days,
give or take.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.709
What?!

07:55.743 --> 07:57.945
You mean you haven't even left
while I'm at work?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.847
But the other day
I came home for lunch

07:59.880 --> 08:02.215
and jerked it for 45 minutes.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.052
I was hiding under the bed.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.820
Oh.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.522
Oh...

08:08.556 --> 08:11.058
So, I take it you're not

08:11.091 --> 08:12.059
going to therapy?

08:12.092 --> 08:13.393
Wrong!

08:13.426 --> 08:15.062
I Skype with that
titty-sucking bitch

08:15.095 --> 08:16.564
every week.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.667
I am still taking my meds and

08:19.700 --> 08:22.335
holding down my job,
so she's happy.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.537
Dummy.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.972
Are you holding down
your job?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.374
I'm paying randos
to take care

08:27.407 --> 08:30.043
of my bullshit clients, and I
told the boys I'm in Europe

08:30.077 --> 08:31.311
scouting new talent and

08:31.344 --> 08:33.981
making connect...
Shit, shit!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.449
I'm late for my
Skype with them.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.254
Oh.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.424
Oh, bonjour.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.226
Oh, you're in France now.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.695
God, I love Paris.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.829
Did you go to the Louvre?

08:48.862 --> 08:49.863
Oh, no, it's closed.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.498
They're cleaning the rugs.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.833
Uh, where's Honey Nutz?

08:52.866 --> 08:53.934
He couldn't make it.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.368
He said he had a colonoscopy.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.369
Isn't he young for that?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.605
Well, he said it's never

08:57.638 --> 08:58.772
too early to start,
but come on,

08:58.806 --> 09:00.173
we all know the truth, right?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.342
Zachary craves any kind
of human touch.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.444
Anyway, bitch,
what opportunities

09:04.477 --> 09:05.846
have you gotten for us?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.347
You've been gone forever.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.016
I am laying
important groundwork.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.184
I'm talking you up
to all the music press,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.786
the influential bloggers.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.055
Uh, pardonnez-moi,
uh,ashtray,

09:15.088 --> 09:16.089
s'il vous plaГ®t.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.090
Merci.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.458
It's just that you've been gone

09:18.491 --> 09:20.360
for a long time, and we actually
have press needs here.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.362
I tweet-threatened
Connie Chung yesterday,

09:22.395 --> 09:24.798
and not a peep, Gretchen,
not one peep.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.768
Guys, there is a surging hunger

09:27.801 --> 09:29.903
for American hip-hop
in Europe right now.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.639
You know, because of Brexit.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.773
You can't deny that.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.207
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.475
That makes sense.
Anyway,

09:35.508 --> 09:38.111
I'm going
to Hot Mix 97.8 tonight.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.748
They are playing you on their
Magnifique Mash-up Hour.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.482
Make sure they play "Titty Tag."

09:42.515 --> 09:44.584
Or "Pussy on Swoll."
Mm-hmm.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.787
Uh, voulez voulez.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.555
Merci.
(forced laugh)

09:48.588 --> 09:50.658
Stupide. (chuckles)
I have to go.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.160
Ciao.
Also, make sure you...

09:54.327 --> 09:55.963
Girl.
Right?

09:55.996 --> 09:59.299
No, I meant girl...

09:59.332 --> 10:02.402
You have got to
leave the apartment.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.973
Sweetie, just go
outside for an hour.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.474
You're listening to
poor-people radio.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.576
You have the bush of
an old Italian man.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.811
You're doing crack.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.947
But isn't it
kind of awesome, though,

10:13.981 --> 10:16.850
that I came straight here after
Jimmy left me on that hill,

10:16.884 --> 10:17.851
and haven't left?

10:17.885 --> 10:18.919
Like, that is pretty much

10:18.952 --> 10:21.554
straight baller
when you think about it.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.259
What if I run into him
and then I die?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.628
I'm trying to
stalk him online,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.130
but that idiot
hasn't updated anything.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.465
Have you figured out
why he left yet?

10:32.499 --> 10:35.302
Why he asked me to be his wife
and then drove away?

10:35.335 --> 10:38.338
Best I can figure, he was
paid by one of my enemies.

10:38.371 --> 10:42.442
It was just a long con to prank
me by someone who I did wrong.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.344
Probably Jason Mraz
for when I called him

10:44.377 --> 10:46.279
a fedora-wearing diarrhea.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.182
Do you believe Edgar
that he hasn't heard from Jimmy?

10:49.216 --> 10:51.852
Oh, no. Edgar is obviously
covering for him.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.687
Really? That fink.

10:53.721 --> 10:56.223
Well, no one lies to me.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.657
Hey, do you know where
those Eskimo Pies are

10:57.691 --> 10:59.326
that I put in the freezer?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.161
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
the police came for them.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.696
Weird.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.997
Oh, well.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.768
*

11:14.908 --> 11:16.243
(knocks on door)

11:16.276 --> 11:17.577
Come in!

11:19.847 --> 11:22.149
Lindsay.
What are you doing?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.817
I'm just trying to come up
with some pitch ideas

11:23.851 --> 11:25.085
for the show
I'm working on,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.386
Doug Loves Sketches.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.188
It's about sketches.
Doug loves 'em.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.890
I know, I watched season one.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.558
I loved "Guido Baby."
(gasps)

11:32.559 --> 11:33.894
"Guido Baby" was mine.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.162
You could totally tell!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.563
BOTH:
"Wah!

11:36.596 --> 11:37.697
Oh!"

11:37.731 --> 11:39.399
Jimmy!

11:39.432 --> 11:41.168
Jimmy, I'm coming down!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.170
What are you doing?
I know he's here.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.404
He's really not.
Please.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.106
I could read people
like a deck of cards,

11:46.139 --> 11:48.041
and you're holding
the "Q" of clovers.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.343
Give him up, chico!
Where is he?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.112
He's not here.
He never came back, okay?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.548
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.084
At first, I drove around
looking for him,

11:57.117 --> 11:59.352
from bar to bar, every night.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.421
Showing photos, asking around.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.423
I even started
a hotline.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.860
Tips came in,
but they never led anywhere.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.762
Now I just...

12:08.796 --> 12:11.531
keep a light on for him and...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.266
I leave him messages
every once and awhile

12:13.300 --> 12:15.202
just to hear his voice.
(music ends)

12:15.235 --> 12:16.937
But life goes on.
It must.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.405
Ha!

12:18.438 --> 12:20.941
That's too many details.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.542
Look.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.144
I redecorated.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.181
Would I dare do that
if Jimmy was still here?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.984
He'd kill you.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.419
(whispers):
Exactly.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.121
(sighs)

12:36.356 --> 12:37.791
(sighs)

12:37.825 --> 12:40.127
So he just never
came home from proposing?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.262
He just disappeared?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.932
Maybe he moved
back to England.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.300
I don't know.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.802
But he's gone.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.476
WOMAN (on TV):
So you're sure

12:56.509 --> 12:57.845
a handsome fellow like you

12:57.878 --> 12:59.612
doesn't have a girlfriend.
(phone vibrates)

12:59.646 --> 13:00.848
Yo.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.115
LINDSAY:
You won L.A.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.350
What?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.918
Jimmy never came home either.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.286
Guess you guys are both pussies.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.188
Gretch, he's gone.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.857
He must've drove back
to England.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.124
Whoa.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.293
Okay.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.162
Thanks.
WOMAN (on TV):
I saw everything!

13:15.195 --> 13:17.497
MAN:
Since this is obviously over,

13:17.530 --> 13:18.966
I'll just be (bleep) honest.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.533
I was gonna bang that chick.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.801
(exhales)

13:21.835 --> 13:24.037
(softly):
Okay.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.839
(car horn honks)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.143
*

13:34.047 --> 13:36.049
(exhales)

13:37.384 --> 13:39.887
(siren wailing)

13:39.920 --> 13:42.522
(helicopter blades whirring)

13:42.555 --> 13:44.557
(indistinct chatter)

13:50.063 --> 13:53.901
So, what would you say your
most pressing style needs

13:53.934 --> 13:56.169
are right now?
Trends.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.139
I need to be told what
the trends are going to be.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.975
Like... what are people
wearing in Japan

14:02.009 --> 14:03.710
next year? Hmm?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.145
Also, been really
feeling poopy pants

14:05.178 --> 14:06.379
these days.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.048
No autographs.
Uh-uh. (snaps)

14:08.081 --> 14:09.349
You need to go!

14:10.283 --> 14:11.718
Hi!

14:11.751 --> 14:13.086
You guys are out of
Goldfish, by the way.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.421
Can I help you?
Um, sorry.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.688
That's my...

14:16.689 --> 14:18.558
Sorry.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.928
(whispers):
What are you doing?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.029
I tried to go outside,

14:22.062 --> 14:23.596
but it's boring as shit.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.065
Shh.
It's just busses

14:25.098 --> 14:26.399
and old Asian ladies

14:26.433 --> 14:27.667
with the wheelie carts.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.937
When did sounds
get so loud, yo?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.204
Anyway, so I came here.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.439
What are you guys doing?
Gretchen!

14:32.472 --> 14:34.707
I need you
to listen to me.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.210
I cannot be
your only person.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.446
Why not?
Gretchen,

14:39.479 --> 14:40.747
this is my place
of business.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.015
Go.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.616
But I don't want to go.
Go.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.119
Go. Go.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.088
Go.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.193
Sorry.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.962
Mentally ill neighbor.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.229
(chuckles)

14:56.263 --> 14:57.464
Thanks, Obama.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.765
(both laugh)

14:59.899 --> 15:01.868
(rock music playing
from car stereo)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.903
(sighs)

15:06.739 --> 15:10.077
(gasps)
Oh, good! You're done!

15:10.110 --> 15:11.611
What are we gonna do now?

15:11.644 --> 15:14.147
Have you been out here
the whole time?!

15:14.181 --> 15:16.083
Yeah, just like
three hours.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.550
(sighs)
You told me to wait outside.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.786
I introduced
this cabbie to Jack FM.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.754
(singsongy):
He loves it!

15:21.788 --> 15:23.423
(laughs)
Not that Jack would care.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.293
That guy does not play
by society's rules.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.728
I meant go outside
into the world.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.130
You are losing your shit

15:30.163 --> 15:32.265
and moping about
your ex-boyfriend, but...

15:32.299 --> 15:33.500
Not "ex," he's not
my ex-boyfriend.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.767
We're still
technically engaged.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.503
Are you goddamn kidding me?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.006
I don't know!
Who knows?!

15:39.039 --> 15:40.907
You don't know!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.142
Do you know?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.143
(sighs)

15:44.644 --> 15:48.581
You are my best friend
in the entire world.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.083
We share a toothbrush.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.118
We do?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.519
But you can't come home tonight.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.953
I can go anywhere.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.188
I know,
let's go kill someone.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.324
Focus!
Okay.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.326
That's better.
Babe,

15:59.359 --> 16:00.793
this is for your own good.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.263
I am only going
to say this once:

16:03.296 --> 16:05.932
Gretchen, it's been...

16:05.965 --> 16:07.367
* One week since
you looked at me *

16:07.400 --> 16:08.835
* Cocked your head to the
side and said "I'm angry" *

16:08.868 --> 16:10.370
* Five days since
you laughed at me *

16:10.403 --> 16:11.938
* You said, "Get back together,
come back and see me" *

16:11.971 --> 16:13.340
* Three days since
the living room *

16:13.373 --> 16:14.774
* Realized it's all my fault,
but couldn't tell you *

16:14.807 --> 16:16.176
* Yesterday you'd forgiven me

16:16.209 --> 16:17.810
* But it'll still be two days
till I say I'm sorry *

16:17.844 --> 16:19.046
* Hold it now and
watch me hoodwink *

16:19.079 --> 16:20.047
* Make yourself think

16:20.080 --> 16:21.148
* Think you're looking
at Aquaman *

16:21.181 --> 16:22.449
* I summon fish to the dish,
although *

16:22.482 --> 16:24.051
* I like the Chalet Swiss,
I like the sushi *

16:24.084 --> 16:25.318
* 'Cause it's never hits the
frying pan, hot like wasabi *

16:25.352 --> 16:26.553
* When I bust rhymes

16:26.586 --> 16:28.055
* Big like LeAnn Rimes
'cause I'm all about value *

16:28.088 --> 16:29.189
* Bert Kaempfert's
got the mad hits. *
(screams)

16:34.161 --> 16:35.462
I can't take it anymore!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.863
EDGAR:
What's wrong?
Well, I just got done

16:36.896 --> 16:38.231
with a full day at work.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.732
And then I had night work,
and now

16:39.766 --> 16:41.334
I have homework.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.835
That's three kinds of work.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.737
And Gretchen won't give me
any space.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.839
She Canada-rapped at me.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.875
You and me, we have jobs now.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.110
We are businesspeople.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.846
(gulps)
Edgar?

16:57.617 --> 17:00.187
We're the serious ones now.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.389
Oh, my God.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.062
I miss them.
Me, too.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.502
(as Jimmy):
My God, at least use

17:15.535 --> 17:17.237
a coaster, woman.
(laughs)

17:17.270 --> 17:18.705
(laughs)

17:18.738 --> 17:19.939
(as Gretchen):
But I'm too busy looking at

17:19.972 --> 17:21.408
awesome dogs on the Internet.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.211
Right, that's it,
I can't take it anymore!

17:24.244 --> 17:25.845
I'm going downstairs.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.014
Well, I was gonna go
down there anyway

17:28.047 --> 17:30.550
to take a shower
and not wash my legs.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.420
Maybe I'll work on
my tree house blueprint.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.788
Perhaps I'll add a wall.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.024
Don't bug me in there,
I'm gonna be jerking it

17:38.057 --> 17:39.359
to gangbang porn.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.229
I'm going to drink
alcohol in my bed

17:42.262 --> 17:44.297
and read a very
boring book.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.032
No, pay attention to me.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.135
I'm Gretchen.
Play with my hair.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.703
Rambling speech about
myself, pointed insult,

17:50.737 --> 17:53.440
mock horror, extended
metaphor that gets off track,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.242
and then I call
myself out for it!

17:55.275 --> 17:57.877
(chuckling): Thirstiness,
nasal laugh, being gross.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.113
Yet another reminder
that I'm mentally ill.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.648
Thirstiness.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.916
Play with me.
Come on, I'm Gretchen.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.418
Kiss me!
Stop bothering me!

18:05.452 --> 18:07.487
I'm bored.
All right, fine,
I'll kiss you.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.122
Jesus!
Yeah.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.825
Well, do me already, dummy.
Ah, fine.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.295
(both chuckle)

18:15.328 --> 18:17.164
* Ooh... *

18:17.197 --> 18:20.267
(both moaning softly)

18:20.300 --> 18:22.969
* Ooh... *

18:28.641 --> 18:31.043
* Ooh... *

18:37.217 --> 18:38.451
Hi.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.287
Is this seat taken?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.988
Why, no.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.895
*

18:56.135 --> 18:58.505
*

19:05.678 --> 19:08.848
(both panting)

19:08.881 --> 19:12.452
Listen, Edgar, that was...
really good sex.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.321
Right? Like really good.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.690
But just so you know, I'm really
committed to my job right now

19:17.724 --> 19:20.460
and I don't want you
to get your feelings hurt.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.230
(panting softly)

19:23.263 --> 19:25.064
(exhales slowly)

19:25.097 --> 19:27.400
I am so glad you said that

19:27.434 --> 19:29.236
because, as amazing as that was,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.170
I feel, like, nothing for you.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.839
I am all about my job right now.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.073
Really?
Yeah.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.308
Oh. Good, then.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.710
(both laugh)

19:41.248 --> 19:43.650
Oh.
So, wait,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.485
we just had dope sex,

19:45.518 --> 19:46.853
and don't feel
the need to discuss it.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.088
Ew. Not at all.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.557
And we could, like,
do this again

19:50.590 --> 19:52.925
whenever we feel
like it-- or not--

19:52.959 --> 19:55.061
and be fine either way.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.396
I think so.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.599
Me, too.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.867
(laughs)

20:00.900 --> 20:02.101
Cool.
Cool.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.503
Cool. Cool.
Cool.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.737
Cool.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.573
You know,
I could go again.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.175
(claps) How about this?
An hour of sustained work,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.410
and then round two.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.380
You are so smart.
Pssh!

20:13.413 --> 20:15.782
(chuckles)
(sighs)

20:15.815 --> 20:17.750
All right.
Phew!

20:17.784 --> 20:19.519
This is so great.
(page flips)

20:19.552 --> 20:21.421
After all that time
with annoying-ass Gretchen,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.256
you're not even trying
to bother me while I...

20:23.290 --> 20:24.891
Shh...
Sorry.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.261
*

20:28.295 --> 20:30.497
(sighs deeply)

20:46.178 --> 20:50.783
* Living in a concrete jungle

20:53.520 --> 20:57.123
* Searching for something
that I *

20:57.156 --> 20:59.326
* Don't think I'll ever find

20:59.359 --> 21:00.993
Come here, you.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.496
* Chisel the walls of the city

21:03.530 --> 21:06.766
* That blinds me

21:08.301 --> 21:09.636
Mmm.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.338
There she is.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.072
Oh, I missed you.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.774
* To relate to

21:14.807 --> 21:18.110
(moans)
Divine.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.612
Shh. Shh.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.748
Shh.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.316
(phone chimes and vibrates)

21:27.954 --> 21:29.989
(Ty moans softly)

21:30.022 --> 21:33.860
* Take me home

21:33.893 --> 21:37.597
* I am ready for it

21:37.630 --> 21:41.167
* I know you can love

21:41.200 --> 21:43.770
* More than I can

21:43.803 --> 21:45.171
(Ty moaning)

21:45.204 --> 21:46.839
* Take me home

21:48.741 --> 21:52.379
* I am ready for it

21:52.412 --> 21:56.115
* I know you can love

21:56.148 --> 21:59.786
* More than I can

21:59.819 --> 22:03.523
* Take me home

22:03.556 --> 22:07.159
* I am ready for it

22:07.193 --> 22:10.730
* I know you can love

22:10.763 --> 22:12.865
* More than I...

22:12.899 --> 22:15.868

Hey, fellas.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.514
I'm on antidepressants,
so I won't even cry after.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.349
-Are you a fan of poetry?
-Which one first?

22:30.383 --> 22:34.086
We shall not go gentle
into this good night.

If you know what I mean.

-Honey, trust me.
-(sighs)

22:58.745 --> 23:02.582
Your mom knows.
It's time for you
to learn these secrets.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.389
-How does this help?
-It doesn't. Ha!

23:10.990 --> 23:12.258
Oh, my God.
