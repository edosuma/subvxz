WEBVTT

00:01.623 --> 00:04.351
I've been chosen. This are my markings.

00:04.356 --> 00:06.478
- William...
- William is dead.

00:06.479 --> 00:09.290
We may have number, but Claire's
got a hell of a lot more weapons.

00:10.645 --> 00:12.765
- Looking for somebody?
- I'm looking for David Whele.

00:14.216 --> 00:16.493
How's the darkness feel, Gabriel?

00:16.494 --> 00:17.770
Does it tickle?

00:18.233 --> 00:20.290
Clementine was my wife's name.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.100
When the angels fell, she was possessed.

00:22.101 --> 00:23.965
Over time, we became close.

00:24.044 --> 00:27.688
Once evicted from from a human body,
a lower angel doesn't cease to exist.

00:27.689 --> 00:29.311
- Edward.
- Clamentine.

00:30.028 --> 00:32.020
Vega is falling into civil war.

00:32.488 --> 00:35.262
A dyad can help Claire to save the city.

00:35.553 --> 00:37.129
Oh, Edward.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.224
You could have been killed, Gates,

00:38.225 --> 00:40.265
and if you're that stupid,
maybe you should've been.

00:42.157 --> 00:43.575
Wait. That's Michael.

00:43.895 --> 00:44.895
Alex.

00:45.647 --> 00:48.282
- It's the Prophet.
- Look, he's back.

00:48.283 --> 00:50.540
- Mallory.
- Michael.

00:50.936 --> 00:52.351
Michael!

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.405 --> 01:29.572
Welcome back, Michael.

01:33.245 --> 01:36.196
What's happening?

01:36.248 --> 01:38.081
Who are you?

01:39.918 --> 01:42.085
You don't know, archangel?

01:47.592 --> 01:49.626
You're the one who protects this town.

01:49.628 --> 01:52.796
You gave the people the fire
that keeps eight-balls at bay.

01:52.848 --> 01:55.015
They call you "the Prophet."

01:59.187 --> 02:02.555
Many rules to solitaire.

02:02.607 --> 02:04.557
Without rules, there is no order.

02:04.609 --> 02:09.395
And I find order rather calming.

02:09.448 --> 02:11.781
But rules aren't just for games, Michael.

02:11.817 --> 02:14.951
How did I get back to Mallory?

02:14.986 --> 02:16.820
I brought you here.

02:16.822 --> 02:18.788
You made a promise in this church

02:18.824 --> 02:21.157
to honor my rules.

02:21.159 --> 02:23.326
Every five years a person
would sacrifice themselves

02:23.328 --> 02:26.246
to purge this town of its sins.

02:26.298 --> 02:28.298
It worked beautifully...

02:28.333 --> 02:29.833
until you walked in.

02:29.885 --> 02:31.835
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

02:33.004 --> 02:36.589
That, uh, dagger you killed yourself with

02:36.641 --> 02:40.009
wasn't Empyrean steel, was it?

02:40.011 --> 02:41.845
What do you want?

02:48.353 --> 02:51.271
I want you dead, Michael.

02:54.659 --> 02:56.860
You promised to sacrifice
your life for this town,

02:56.912 --> 03:00.196
and I'm here to make
sure you keep your word.

03:07.589 --> 03:09.873
How long has he been like this?

03:09.925 --> 03:12.041
Two hours. I can't wake him.

03:12.094 --> 03:15.628
I don't understand.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.848
What could do this to an archangel?

03:18.884 --> 03:21.184
I've never seen Michael sick before.

03:23.355 --> 03:25.305
Core temperature readings are offline.

03:25.357 --> 03:27.390
Our communication links must have been hit.

03:27.392 --> 03:29.976
Let me see that.

03:32.564 --> 03:33.730
Where's Michael?

03:33.782 --> 03:36.316
Out of commission for now.

03:36.368 --> 03:38.234
- How bad is it?
- Bad.

03:38.236 --> 03:40.653
Armed rebels took the nuclear
reactor and sealed the exits.

03:40.705 --> 03:42.572
That sounds like Whele.

03:42.624 --> 03:45.125
Civil war's almost over.
He's getting desperate.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.576
Claire, is he allowed to be in here?

03:46.578 --> 03:48.912
I'm Archangel Corps. Who are you?

03:48.914 --> 03:52.081
This is Gates Foley.
He's Vega's lead engineer.

03:52.134 --> 03:54.501
Fill Alex in, maybe he can help.

03:54.553 --> 03:58.254
Sure. It's a fast neutron reactor.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.807
I used lead-bismuth
eutectic for the coolant,

04:00.842 --> 04:02.425
and I added weapons-grade uranium

04:02.477 --> 04:03.927
to kick-start the reaction.

04:03.979 --> 04:07.063
Gates.

04:08.733 --> 04:10.433
Basically, they have a bomb,

04:10.485 --> 04:11.935
and they're not taking our calls.

04:11.937 --> 04:13.403
I'll go in.

04:13.438 --> 04:15.738
- And do what, exactly?
- Lead a team, take back control.

04:15.774 --> 04:16.940
Now, why didn't I think of that?

04:16.992 --> 04:18.524
Bullets flying in a nuclear facility,

04:18.577 --> 04:20.057
I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

04:20.077 --> 04:21.861
Listen, New Delphi's army is coming.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.947
Add that to the list of
our current shitstorm, Alex.

04:23.949 --> 04:25.532
With no control of the reactor,

04:25.584 --> 04:26.666
we have no way to power our defenses.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.117
Okay, why don't you let me

04:28.119 --> 04:30.253
look after the technical stuff, okay, kid?

04:30.288 --> 04:31.704
Claire, I'm telling you,

04:31.756 --> 04:33.039
we need to take back
that reactor right now.

04:33.091 --> 04:34.791
No, we need to get the radio up

04:34.793 --> 04:37.961
and talk these anarchists down.

04:42.517 --> 04:44.267
He's right, Alex.

04:44.302 --> 04:48.271
We can't go in, guns
blazing. It's too risky.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.640
You have an hour to make contact.

04:50.692 --> 04:52.275
Be ready with a team if he can't.

04:52.310 --> 04:55.278
Don't worry, Claire, I got this.

05:03.705 --> 05:06.906
Edward?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.826
What's the matter?

05:09.828 --> 05:13.746
I feel strange, sort of off balance.

05:13.798 --> 05:15.832
You're adjusting, that's all.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.500
Oh.

05:17.502 --> 05:19.335
Julian said being a dyad

05:19.387 --> 05:21.638
is the perfect harmony
between angel and human,

05:21.673 --> 05:23.423
but it doesn't feel that way to me.

05:23.475 --> 05:26.593
It takes time.

05:26.645 --> 05:29.145
I know giving over the Amphora to Julian

05:29.180 --> 05:31.180
wasn't an easy decision.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.683
Becoming a dyad didn't just save yourself.

05:33.685 --> 05:35.818
You saved me.

05:35.854 --> 05:38.605
Well, I couldn't have Julian harm you.

05:38.657 --> 05:40.273
We're safe now.

05:40.325 --> 05:41.658
Your heart?

05:41.693 --> 05:43.610
Ooh, I feel like
a 20-year-old...

05:43.662 --> 05:44.777
only better.

05:47.866 --> 05:50.450
Boss wants to see you.

05:56.875 --> 06:00.209
This I had to see for myself.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.380
Gabriel.

06:04.432 --> 06:08.468
Pleasure to finally meet you, General.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.666
<b>sync and corrected by Caio
www.addic7ed.com</b>

06:22.567 --> 06:23.866
What's up?

06:23.902 --> 06:25.401
He says he'll only talk
to the lady of the city.

06:25.403 --> 06:27.403
Name's Ramirez, V-2.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.238
Ramirez? He was Archangel Corps.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.157
Guess he had a change of heart.

06:31.209 --> 06:32.542
This is Lady Riesen.

06:32.577 --> 06:35.878
Uh-oh, Mom's home.

06:35.914 --> 06:38.081
Am I in trouble?

06:38.083 --> 06:40.416
Yeah, and whatever
David Whele promised you,

06:40.418 --> 06:41.918
Daddy lied.

06:41.970 --> 06:43.836
Put down your arms and come out.

06:43.888 --> 06:45.505
In this kind of situation,

06:45.557 --> 06:47.256
I'm pretty sure the guy
with the nuclear reactor

06:47.309 --> 06:49.342
usually calls the shots.

06:49.394 --> 06:51.594
Look, buddy, there's enough
uranium 235 in that reactor

06:51.596 --> 06:52.645
to send us all sky high.

06:52.681 --> 06:54.430
If the distributors, coolants, or core

06:54.432 --> 06:55.565
get even a hairline fracture...

06:55.600 --> 06:58.267
Ramirez, it's Sergeant Lannon.

06:58.269 --> 07:00.570
Lannon, I thought you left Vega.

07:00.605 --> 07:02.772
Yeah, I came back just in time

07:02.774 --> 07:06.192
to tell these guys how
much of an asshole you are.

07:08.997 --> 07:10.747
What do you say we work this out,

07:10.782 --> 07:12.332
make sure no one goes boom?

07:17.088 --> 07:18.955
What the hell, Lannon?

07:19.007 --> 07:21.457
Your friends messing with us?

07:21.459 --> 07:23.926
That alarm means a temperature spike.

07:23.962 --> 07:25.762
There must be a core leak.

07:25.797 --> 07:27.680
- If hydrogen even starts...
- English, Gates.

07:27.716 --> 07:29.182
Boom.

07:30.435 --> 07:32.935
Okay. How long have we got?

07:32.971 --> 07:35.471
Two hours if we're lucky.

07:35.473 --> 07:37.974
Listen, Ramirez, you got to get out now.

07:37.976 --> 07:39.475
This is real, no games here.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.477
The alarm means the core is leaking.

07:41.479 --> 07:43.446
What if the only way to
change things around here

07:43.481 --> 07:45.448
is to start over, hmm?

07:45.483 --> 07:47.400
Give Vega a fresh start?

07:47.452 --> 07:49.485
Look, I get it. Vega's a mess.

07:49.487 --> 07:51.487
I want to see it change as much as you do.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.990
Then how come you're not down here with us?

07:54.042 --> 07:55.992
'Cause we have to find another way.

07:55.994 --> 07:58.077
The reactor blows, the angels win.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.329
Look around, Alex.

08:00.331 --> 08:03.166
We already lost.

08:05.470 --> 08:07.754
Oh, can you stop the meltdown?

08:07.806 --> 08:09.505
Not from out here.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.674
I'll take you in.

08:22.978 --> 08:26.279
David's rebels want to
blow up the nuclear reactor.

08:26.315 --> 08:29.482
This prison cell is in the blast radius.

08:29.534 --> 08:33.486
Just a heads-up, one woman to another.

08:33.538 --> 08:36.823
You're too good to me, Claire.

08:36.825 --> 08:38.124
When my soldiers arrested you,

08:38.159 --> 08:40.159
I had them search your apartment.

08:40.162 --> 08:42.996
They didn't find anything,
so I had them search it again.

08:43.048 --> 08:44.547
I thought, "If I were a sociopathic,

08:44.583 --> 08:45.832
"duplicitous bitch,

08:45.884 --> 08:48.501
where would I hide something?"

08:48.553 --> 08:52.339
Floor lamp, hollow base.

08:52.391 --> 08:55.675
You used this radio to try
to get him to defeat me.

08:55.727 --> 08:59.012
If you use it now to
put him back in my hands,

08:59.014 --> 09:00.647
you just might live.

09:00.682 --> 09:02.315
So who's it gonna be?

09:02.351 --> 09:06.069
Do you care whether David
comes back dead or alive?

09:07.105 --> 09:09.856
No.

09:09.858 --> 09:11.941
Just bring him to me.

09:26.124 --> 09:29.042
Ah, my favorite. Thanks, Al.

09:29.044 --> 09:30.760
Where the hell is O'Connor?

09:30.796 --> 09:32.595
If Ramirez has taken the nuclear reactor,

09:32.631 --> 09:34.848
we haven't lost this war yet.

09:34.883 --> 09:37.183
David, relax.

09:37.219 --> 09:38.685
Eat something.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.887
I'm not hungry. We need to leave.

09:40.939 --> 09:44.441
These people find comfort in my presence.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.443
I'm right where God wants me to be.

09:46.478 --> 09:48.111
They all believe...

09:48.146 --> 09:50.363
I'm their Chosen One? Yeah.

09:50.399 --> 09:52.565
They believe because I am.

09:52.567 --> 09:55.402
Stop this. You're my son.

09:55.404 --> 09:59.406
Was I your son the day you
left me in the desert to die?

10:01.660 --> 10:03.209
Okay.

10:03.245 --> 10:05.211
Okay, say anything you want to say to me,

10:05.247 --> 10:06.746
but talk fast.

10:06.798 --> 10:10.250
I'm not walking out that door without you.

10:10.302 --> 10:12.469
You have somewhere better you want to be?

10:12.504 --> 10:15.805
What about this situation
are you not understanding?

10:15.841 --> 10:17.424
You're supposed to be dead.

10:17.426 --> 10:18.925
If Claire finds you,

10:18.927 --> 10:20.810
you're gonna hang.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.096
And I'll be swinging next to you.

10:23.148 --> 10:25.098
We have to leave Vega.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.768
We're not going anywhere.

10:30.939 --> 10:34.107
God chose me to cleanse the world of evil,

10:34.159 --> 10:36.276
one person at a time.

10:36.278 --> 10:39.779
And I don't know a heart more
troubled than yours, David.

10:39.781 --> 10:43.867
The moment I saw you, I
knew God brought you to me.

10:45.704 --> 10:49.456
My work begins with you.

10:57.349 --> 10:59.966
Kat, did you find David?

11:00.018 --> 11:03.102
David's in a bar behind Circus Circus.

11:03.138 --> 11:04.354
I'm watching him now.

11:04.389 --> 11:06.272
Kill him.

11:06.308 --> 11:09.642
Look at us,
face-to-face, finally.

11:09.694 --> 11:11.144
Where's the Amphora?

11:11.196 --> 11:14.481
The Amphora? Really?

11:14.483 --> 11:17.450
We have so many better
things to talk about, General.

11:17.486 --> 11:19.152
Tell me everything.

11:19.204 --> 11:22.121
If you unlock the Amphora,
it'll wipe us all out...

11:22.157 --> 11:23.490
Angels and humans.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.657
I know.

11:24.659 --> 11:27.160
It's over there...

11:28.830 --> 11:31.831
One of two parting gifts Julian left me.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.167
The other was his army.

11:34.169 --> 11:37.554
You could lead it for me.

11:37.589 --> 11:39.672
I'd die first.

11:42.310 --> 11:46.513
There is so much Empyrean steel

11:46.515 --> 11:49.232
in this city to destroy.

11:50.769 --> 11:53.186
What do you want, Gabriel?

11:53.188 --> 11:56.523
I want my brother!

11:58.109 --> 12:00.193
I hear reports Michael's in Vega.

12:00.195 --> 12:03.863
Fortifying Las Vegas
was a stroke of genius.

12:03.915 --> 12:07.283
Defenses, Michael at your side...

12:07.335 --> 12:11.671
and after all these
years, you're still here.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.931
Trying out your new strength, I see.

12:21.967 --> 12:26.469
Still, becoming a dyad was a
risky move, don't you think?

12:26.521 --> 12:29.055
What do you mean?

12:29.057 --> 12:32.058
In a dyad, one spirit is always dominant...

12:32.060 --> 12:35.061
The human or the angel.

12:35.113 --> 12:38.147
Julian was a dyad for a long time.

12:38.199 --> 12:40.650
Inside him, Lyrae easily controlled

12:40.702 --> 12:43.653
his weaker half.

12:43.705 --> 12:47.574
Where do you think you'll find
the strength to stay human?

12:56.301 --> 12:58.751
Take the general and his
woman outside the city

12:58.803 --> 12:59.803
and let them go.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.005
Yes, sir.

13:02.057 --> 13:04.757
You're one of us now, Edward.

13:04.809 --> 13:08.928
Becoming an angel was
the ultimate surrender.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.481
What greater victory
could I have hoped for?

13:16.404 --> 13:18.271
This war won't end until David's dead.

13:18.323 --> 13:20.440
Like it or not, Arika's our
best chance of finding him.

13:20.442 --> 13:22.191
You have to find another way.

13:22.243 --> 13:23.943
Why? Maybe it takes a
rat to find another rat.

13:23.995 --> 13:25.695
Claire, Arika poisoned me.

13:25.747 --> 13:26.863
What?

13:26.915 --> 13:28.498
Don't worry. I'm fine.

13:28.533 --> 13:29.666
I figured it out in time.

13:29.701 --> 13:30.950
Why didn't you tell me?

13:31.002 --> 13:32.285
And let Arika blackmail you?

13:32.337 --> 13:33.836
I was trying to keep you safe from her.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.622
I didn't realize that
you were gonna be stopping

13:35.674 --> 13:37.290
by the prison for visiting hours.

13:37.292 --> 13:40.960
Look, if she offers you a glass
of water, just say no, okay?

13:40.962 --> 13:42.845
Just be careful.

13:42.881 --> 13:44.380
Oh, wow.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.965
You're the one going
into a nuclear reactor,

13:46.017 --> 13:47.800
and you're telling me to be careful?

13:47.802 --> 13:50.470
I'm sure mini Rambo
and I will be just fine.

13:50.472 --> 13:51.554
What?

13:51.606 --> 13:53.139
One last kiss for luck?

13:53.141 --> 13:54.974
There's something you
should know about Alex.

13:54.976 --> 13:56.496
Okay, or we could just talk about him.

13:56.528 --> 13:57.694
He's the Chosen One.

13:57.729 --> 14:01.147
My ass, he is.

14:01.149 --> 14:03.316
You're serious.

14:03.368 --> 14:06.152
I know how crazy it sounds,
but I swear it's true.

14:06.154 --> 14:08.871
I saw the markings transfer
onto him from his dad myself.

14:08.907 --> 14:11.374
Look, I have never given

14:11.409 --> 14:13.376
the whole "Chosen One" thing much thought,

14:13.411 --> 14:15.161
but if the prophecy is real,

14:15.213 --> 14:17.997
I'm telling you, that kid is not him.

14:20.301 --> 14:23.503
Just go save the human race.

14:23.505 --> 14:26.222
Just remember that includes Alex.

14:27.559 --> 14:29.058
I'll see you soon, all right?

14:29.094 --> 14:31.227
You can count on it.

14:31.262 --> 14:33.096
You know, there's still so much

14:33.148 --> 14:34.868
that I don't even know about you, you know?

14:34.899 --> 14:37.600
What's your favorite food? Can you dance?

14:38.903 --> 14:42.188
Just come back in one piece
so I can step on your toes.

14:53.251 --> 14:55.118
I'll take care of the reactor.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.703
You stay here.

14:56.755 --> 14:58.121
Michael needs you more than me right now.

14:58.173 --> 14:59.422
Michael will figure something out.

14:59.457 --> 15:01.040
And so will you.

15:01.042 --> 15:02.759
Aah.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.877
Hey. Hey. What's wrong?

15:04.929 --> 15:07.296
I'm fine. Don't worry.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.968
Nomes...

15:12.020 --> 15:14.270
Sometimes it feels like

15:14.305 --> 15:15.972
they're being torn off again.

15:16.024 --> 15:18.558
Phantom pains.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.310
Worse.

15:21.362 --> 15:23.780
Crazy how a part of you can hurt so much

15:23.815 --> 15:26.115
even after it's gone.

15:30.822 --> 15:33.956
How's Claire?

15:35.744 --> 15:38.244
We lost the baby.

15:38.246 --> 15:41.497
Oh, I'm so sorry, Alex.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.583
I'm so sorry.

15:43.635 --> 15:46.469
Thanks, Nomes.

15:46.504 --> 15:49.589
I got to go.

16:01.186 --> 16:03.903
It's Empyrean steel, Michael.

16:17.285 --> 16:19.452
You saved Noma out in the wastelands.

16:19.504 --> 16:21.037
Why?

16:21.089 --> 16:22.789
I like her.

16:22.841 --> 16:25.124
Pity about her wings.

16:25.126 --> 16:27.293
And Alex? You protected him while he slept.

16:27.345 --> 16:30.680
You told Noma to take him
east, to Mallory, I presume.

16:30.715 --> 16:32.431
Why?

16:36.805 --> 16:39.305
What do you want with Alex?

16:39.307 --> 16:41.357
Really, Michael?

16:41.392 --> 16:43.142
Violence in your father's house?

16:43.144 --> 16:44.811
This house isn't Father's.

16:44.863 --> 16:47.196
He stopped asking innocent
people to sacrifice themselves

16:47.232 --> 16:48.648
a long time ago.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.316
These are Old Testament times again.

16:50.368 --> 16:52.151
No, you lied.

16:52.203 --> 16:53.986
You told the people
that God protected them.

16:53.988 --> 16:57.573
Someone is protecting Mallory, but who?

16:57.625 --> 17:00.910
If you knew I cheated, why
didn't you expunge the fire

17:00.962 --> 17:02.578
and destroy the town?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.547
Because you are a special case.

17:04.582 --> 17:06.082
Why?

17:09.503 --> 17:12.003
You broke your promise,
Michael. You must die.

17:12.006 --> 17:15.808
If you don't, I will put
the fire in Mallory out.

17:18.512 --> 17:21.263
And everyone here will
die, including Laurel.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.852
The choice is yours.

17:32.961 --> 17:34.765
- Go, go!
- Move, move, move!

17:34.766 --> 17:36.565
Why don't you send the whole army
and let 'em shoot it out for a while?

17:36.566 --> 17:38.833
This is the part of the
mission where you stop talking.

17:39.719 --> 17:42.520
Okay, boys, remember, no stray bullets.

17:42.555 --> 17:44.522
Let's get "Precious Cargo"
here to the control room.

17:44.557 --> 17:46.140
"Precious Cargo"?

17:46.192 --> 17:47.842
It's your code name.
The guys came up with it.

17:47.877 --> 17:49.811
Okay, for the record, I grow on people.

17:49.813 --> 17:52.363
We don't have time for that, Precious.

17:55.318 --> 17:58.453
It's okay, Alex, you
can't always get the girl.

17:58.488 --> 18:00.121
Let's go. Eyes up.

18:08.665 --> 18:12.717
William Whele was a false prophet...

18:14.053 --> 18:15.837
Gabriel's puppet.

18:15.839 --> 18:18.222
He stood in the light
whilst worshipping darkness,

18:18.258 --> 18:22.009
but in the desert, he atoned.

18:22.011 --> 18:26.514
And out of his pain and
suffering, I was born.

18:26.516 --> 18:29.233
What about you, David? Have you changed?

18:29.269 --> 18:32.937
I hear you've been busy...

18:32.989 --> 18:37.191
Slept with an eight-ball,
split the city in half,

18:37.243 --> 18:41.028
turned a small rebellion
into an all-out civil war.

18:42.532 --> 18:43.998
I'm glad the death of your son

18:44.033 --> 18:46.284
didn't hold you back from
reaching your full potential.

18:46.336 --> 18:48.035
Claire wanted you dead.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.754
Taking you out of the city was the only way

18:49.789 --> 18:51.205
I could give you a shot at survival.

18:51.207 --> 18:53.958
It's haunted me ever since.

18:54.010 --> 18:55.543
So, whoever you are now,

18:55.595 --> 18:58.212
I-I won't leave you again.

19:00.183 --> 19:02.967
It wasn't just William you hurt.

19:03.019 --> 19:06.721
How many others have
suffered at your hands?

19:06.773 --> 19:09.440
Were you haunted by them too?

19:18.401 --> 19:19.901
Why did he let us go?

19:19.953 --> 19:22.787
Oh, it's Gabriel. He's done crazier things.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.739
Now that he's got the
Amphora, he'll do worse.

19:24.741 --> 19:26.908
We need to get you as far
away from here as we can.

19:26.910 --> 19:28.242
Me?

19:28.244 --> 19:31.579
I want you to get down
on the ground right now.

19:33.550 --> 19:35.750
Aah!

19:43.476 --> 19:45.426
They were letting us go.

19:45.478 --> 19:46.844
I can't run, Clem.

19:46.896 --> 19:48.179
Gabriel will kill you.

19:48.231 --> 19:50.097
We have to take the Amphora with us,

19:50.099 --> 19:51.432
or everyone in Vega dies.

19:51.484 --> 19:53.067
Edward, please, let's go.

19:53.102 --> 19:54.569
20 miles south,

19:54.604 --> 19:56.404
there's an abandoned town called Turner.

19:56.439 --> 19:58.439
I drove through it on the way here.

19:58.491 --> 20:01.025
You'll be safe there till I find you.

20:05.698 --> 20:07.164
Watch your step there, champ.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.617
Oh, yeah, I know how to
use the stairs. Thank you.

20:09.619 --> 20:11.452
You ever wonder why Vega's at war?

20:11.454 --> 20:14.205
It's people like you, up in your towers,

20:14.257 --> 20:16.123
safe, protected,

20:16.175 --> 20:18.125
while the rest of us fight to survive.

20:18.127 --> 20:19.210
Uh-huh.

20:19.262 --> 20:21.045
How much time we got?

20:21.097 --> 20:22.680
Less than an hour.

20:22.715 --> 20:23.715
Keep your eyes open.

20:23.716 --> 20:24.799
- Be alert!
- Check.

20:26.269 --> 20:27.269
Get down!

20:30.640 --> 20:32.690
Rebels have the control room surrounded!

20:35.395 --> 20:37.478
Tell them to stop
shooting! It's a nuclear...

20:37.530 --> 20:38.530
Get down!

20:40.984 --> 20:42.817
I think I know a way we can surprise 'em.

20:42.869 --> 20:45.119
Would you let me do my job?

20:45.154 --> 20:47.154
Cover it!

20:47.156 --> 20:48.406
We need to get out of here now,

20:48.458 --> 20:50.157
or else the zirconium metal in the core

20:50.209 --> 20:51.325
will have already started to melt.

20:51.327 --> 20:52.543
You got to trust me!

20:52.579 --> 20:54.912
Okay, lead the way, smart guy.

21:11.514 --> 21:13.014
Don't worry.

21:13.066 --> 21:18.019
The Chosen One will
find his way without you.

21:18.021 --> 21:21.238
If you want your debt paid, take it now.

21:21.274 --> 21:22.607
I don't follow.

21:22.659 --> 21:25.276
A game.

21:25.328 --> 21:27.945
You have nothing to bet.

21:27.997 --> 21:30.364
My life.

21:30.416 --> 21:33.534
Did you not hear a word I said?

21:33.536 --> 21:35.786
I already have your life.

21:35.838 --> 21:38.372
In Vega right now, your body is asleep.

21:38.374 --> 21:39.540
It won't wake up.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.292
I'm immortal.

21:41.344 --> 21:43.377
How long do you think
it'll take my body to die...

21:43.379 --> 21:46.047
10 years, 20, 100?

21:46.049 --> 21:47.715
I've endured far worse than this.

21:47.717 --> 21:49.550
I live still.

21:49.602 --> 21:51.886
One game, Texas Hold'em.

21:51.888 --> 21:54.271
If you win, I do as
promised, sacrifice myself,

21:54.307 --> 21:56.223
right here with your Empyrean steel.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.392
But if I win, you'll release me,

21:58.444 --> 22:02.446
consider my oath fulfilled, and
allow me to return to my body.

22:11.124 --> 22:12.540
Shuffle the cards.

22:15.828 --> 22:17.128
I can't help you

22:17.163 --> 22:19.246
unless you're willing
to face what you've done.

22:19.248 --> 22:21.248
Everything I've done was to protect Vega,

22:21.300 --> 22:22.917
to protect you.

22:22.969 --> 22:24.835
Listen to me, William, please.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.253
My name's not William.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.923
Tell the men at the door to let us...

22:28.975 --> 22:30.474
Let us out of here.

22:30.510 --> 22:32.760
Once we're away and free of the city,

22:32.762 --> 22:34.512
we... we can talk about anything you want.

22:34.564 --> 22:37.515
Then... then I'll repent. I promise.

22:39.068 --> 22:41.268
You're a coward. You haven't changed.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.654
Do you have any idea what I've endured?

22:43.690 --> 22:45.523
One walkabout in the desert,

22:45.575 --> 22:47.024
and you... You're some kind of messiah.

22:47.076 --> 22:48.109
Is that all it takes?

22:48.161 --> 22:51.162
Well, the desert may not
have... have changed me,

22:51.197 --> 22:52.279
but Vega did.

22:52.281 --> 22:55.366
I've lost everything, including you!

22:55.418 --> 22:57.835
I'm not the man I was.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.954
Are you expecting someone?

23:00.006 --> 23:01.956
What?

23:01.958 --> 23:04.041
She's got a gun!

23:07.964 --> 23:10.681
What are you waiting for? Kill her!

23:10.717 --> 23:13.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:13.219 --> 23:16.854
You don't come back here again.

23:16.889 --> 23:17.889
You understand?

23:17.890 --> 23:19.306
The hell with that.

23:30.486 --> 23:33.154
Now, can we go?

23:43.382 --> 23:45.166
How do I know you won't cheat?

23:45.168 --> 23:47.334
You have my word.

23:47.386 --> 23:51.055
And unlike you, Michael,
I honor my commitments.

23:52.258 --> 23:54.258
Deal the cards.

23:57.814 --> 24:00.815
Might as well play faceup.

24:02.902 --> 24:05.519
Not a bad start.

24:05.521 --> 24:07.404
Let's see if the flop can change things.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.691
What do you want with Alex?

24:10.743 --> 24:13.527
It's not about what I want.

24:13.579 --> 24:15.112
All I want are rules and order.

24:15.164 --> 24:16.614
That's it.

24:16.666 --> 24:20.284
I don't like loose ends
and broken promises.

24:20.336 --> 24:24.038
The voice Laurel heard in Mallory...

24:24.040 --> 24:26.924
it's real, but it's not Father.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.543
It's the same voice that gave
you permission to play me,

24:29.595 --> 24:31.045
isn't it?

24:31.097 --> 24:33.848
Tell me who you represent.

24:33.883 --> 24:37.384
Tell me about Alex.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.353
I hear the prophecy says the Chosen One

24:39.388 --> 24:42.022
is destined to be either a great healer

24:42.058 --> 24:44.892
or a great destroyer.

24:44.894 --> 24:47.394
Alex is the last pure heart. He will heal.

24:47.446 --> 24:48.979
Hmm, he's human.

24:49.031 --> 24:51.532
There's light and darkness in all of them.

24:51.567 --> 24:52.733
None of them are pure.

24:52.735 --> 24:55.736
You, out of all the
angels, should know that.

24:55.738 --> 24:58.489
Alex is different. I know he is.

25:01.127 --> 25:03.410
Good.

25:03.412 --> 25:05.913
No more questions.

25:10.837 --> 25:12.820
Pair of kings.

25:12.855 --> 25:16.640
Next card.

25:16.676 --> 25:18.592
Son of a gun.

25:18.594 --> 25:21.979
Look at that. Two aces beats two kings.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.934
What a shame you can't fold.

25:26.986 --> 25:30.571
Michael. Michael.

25:32.191 --> 25:33.774
Aah.

25:51.294 --> 25:53.210
Miller, get to the entrance now!

26:00.887 --> 26:02.853
All clear!

26:07.643 --> 26:09.476
What exactly are you doing?

26:09.478 --> 26:11.779
I thought you wanted me to shut up.

26:11.814 --> 26:13.030
You know, to be honest,

26:13.065 --> 26:15.115
I didn't think that was possible.

26:15.151 --> 26:16.700
Oh, we got a problem.

26:16.736 --> 26:17.902
Can you fix it?

26:17.954 --> 26:22.039
Don't bother.

26:22.074 --> 26:25.326
I thought you said, "All clear."

26:25.328 --> 26:27.828
Who wants to die first?

26:32.561 --> 26:34.511
Move.

26:37.516 --> 26:39.933
Drop your gun, Lannon.

26:47.109 --> 26:50.193
Listen, if I'm gonna die today,

26:50.195 --> 26:52.863
there's one thing I'd like to take care of.

26:52.898 --> 26:54.748
Oh! What the...

26:54.783 --> 26:56.450
I've been wanting to do that all day.

26:56.502 --> 26:59.035
You don't expect me to
believe you're on our side.

26:59.037 --> 27:00.370
I'm on whatever side he's not.

27:00.422 --> 27:02.289
You son of a bitch!

27:04.376 --> 27:06.460
Get me by the gun.

27:06.512 --> 27:08.378
Okay.

27:08.430 --> 27:09.713
All right, that's enough!

27:15.521 --> 27:16.553
Nice shot.

27:16.555 --> 27:18.054
I missed.

27:35.991 --> 27:38.074
Edward! Aah!

27:38.076 --> 27:40.310
Don't interrupt the General.

27:43.348 --> 27:45.799
I knew you'd come back for that, Edward.

27:45.851 --> 27:47.050
Let her go.

27:49.471 --> 27:52.556
Even an angel needs a key.

27:55.894 --> 27:58.478
Gabriel, please.

27:58.530 --> 28:00.897
Dyads are rare, but it's rarer still

28:00.899 --> 28:04.150
for the human spirit to win
dominance over the angel.

28:04.203 --> 28:06.820
Even the human Julian wasn't strong enough,

28:06.872 --> 28:10.123
so Lyrae was in control.

28:10.158 --> 28:14.244
But you have something he didn't.

28:16.298 --> 28:17.831
Your love for Clementine

28:17.883 --> 28:21.501
is what's keeping your human spirit on top.

28:21.553 --> 28:23.970
But I want you to be my soldier, Edward.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.339
And now I know how...

28:26.391 --> 28:28.808
By taking her away from you.

28:28.844 --> 28:32.062
Then there'll be nothing for
your human half to live for.

28:32.097 --> 28:33.263
Edward, I love you.

28:33.315 --> 28:35.515
No! No, no, no!

28:35.567 --> 28:38.101
No!

28:43.525 --> 28:46.159
No, no, no, no.

28:48.030 --> 28:50.614
War's over, Edward. You lost.

28:50.666 --> 28:54.200
So be my soldier.

28:58.206 --> 29:01.007
Oh.

29:23.732 --> 29:25.649
And who are you?

29:25.701 --> 29:28.234
Duma...

29:28.287 --> 29:30.453
a soldier of Gabriel.

29:44.753 --> 29:48.805
And Judas takes another life.

29:50.342 --> 29:52.425
That's it.

29:52.477 --> 29:55.261
If she found me, others will too.

29:55.314 --> 29:57.514
We have to get the hell out of here.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.683
Or I'm... I'm leav...

29:59.735 --> 30:01.267
Hey.

30:02.654 --> 30:04.571
What's that?

30:07.109 --> 30:08.742
A warning.

30:10.195 --> 30:12.195
He wants me to get someplace safer.

30:12.197 --> 30:13.747
Good.

30:13.782 --> 30:15.582
If you won't listen to
me, please listen to him.

30:15.617 --> 30:19.285
Oh, I won't abandon the
friends I've made here.

30:19.338 --> 30:22.038
Not that you'd understand.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.373
I had no choice.

30:23.375 --> 30:26.209
We always have a choice.

30:26.261 --> 30:28.345
That's what you taught your son.

30:33.352 --> 30:37.270
When your mother died, I cut you off.

30:37.305 --> 30:39.472
Leaving you out in the desert

30:39.524 --> 30:43.943
was the second time I abandoned you.

30:43.979 --> 30:46.229
I don't want to do it again.

30:48.567 --> 30:50.116
Please, William.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.736
Come with me.

30:52.788 --> 30:55.905
Will you come with me?

31:09.254 --> 31:12.005
Good-bye, David.

31:48.794 --> 31:50.427
Freeze!

31:53.298 --> 31:55.715
Hello, David...

32:02.107 --> 32:05.525
We're taking back the nuclear plant.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.560
It's over.

32:07.612 --> 32:10.647
I suppose congratulations are in order.

32:10.699 --> 32:13.867
Nicely done, Claire.

32:13.902 --> 32:17.153
Your father would be proud.

32:32.838 --> 32:35.672
Where are you going?

32:35.674 --> 32:39.175
To watch my father die from the back row.

32:39.177 --> 32:42.178
Thank our brothers and
sisters for the warning.

32:43.069 --> 32:44.069
_

32:54.269 --> 32:59.021
- I think you broke a
rib. - No, I-I feel fine.

32:59.073 --> 33:02.141
My rib, asshole.

33:06.247 --> 33:08.614
I thought there was a leak,
but the computer took a hit.

33:08.616 --> 33:11.384
It's not lowering the
control rods into the core.

33:11.419 --> 33:14.453
If those rods don't go back
into the core in ten minutes,

33:14.455 --> 33:15.788
this city will be destroyed.

33:15.790 --> 33:17.507
Can it be fixed?

33:19.460 --> 33:22.295
Yeah, but not from here.

33:22.297 --> 33:24.046
I need to go into the containment room

33:24.098 --> 33:26.299
and lower them manually.

33:26.351 --> 33:28.134
But I need you to stay here.

33:28.186 --> 33:30.186
Watch the reactor's kinetics readings.

33:30.221 --> 33:33.856
I'll talk you through it.

33:33.892 --> 33:38.110
Nine minutes to core breach.

33:44.452 --> 33:47.820
Okay, what am I looking at?

33:47.872 --> 33:51.324
Nothing.

33:51.376 --> 33:53.159
I don't understand. I thought you...

33:53.161 --> 33:55.494
Alex, I can't survive this much radiation.

33:55.547 --> 33:57.763
What?

33:57.799 --> 33:59.749
You can't come in here before
the radiation's been purged.

33:59.801 --> 34:01.500
I'm dead already.

34:01.553 --> 34:04.503
There's no point in both of us dying.

34:04.556 --> 34:06.255
Then get out of there!

34:06.307 --> 34:07.673
I'll go in there.

34:07.725 --> 34:10.009
Just talk me through it. I can do this.

34:10.011 --> 34:12.395
I barricaded it from the inside.

34:12.429 --> 34:15.514
There can only be one martyr today, Alex.

34:15.516 --> 34:16.599
Gates.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.935
Gates, look at me.

34:18.987 --> 34:21.437
Gates! Look at me, Gates!

34:21.489 --> 34:22.855
Don't do this.

34:22.857 --> 34:26.409
I'm sorry, but keeping the power on in Vega

34:26.444 --> 34:28.194
has been my job

34:28.246 --> 34:30.029
ever since the day that Riesen found me.

34:30.081 --> 34:32.748
And I don't want some cocky kid

34:32.784 --> 34:34.617
coming along and taking all the glory,

34:34.668 --> 34:36.034
especially one that
doesn't know the first thing

34:36.087 --> 34:38.536
about isotopic fuel reactions.

34:38.539 --> 34:40.790
Eight minutes to core breach.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.761
Look, I can save us today,

34:45.797 --> 34:50.349
but these rods won't last much longer.

34:52.804 --> 34:55.137
Vega only has a few years left.

34:55.188 --> 34:57.723
These people need a new home, Alex,

34:57.775 --> 35:00.059
and I think you can get them there.

35:00.111 --> 35:03.946
Count on it.

35:06.985 --> 35:09.485
There's only two kings
left in the whole deck.

35:09.537 --> 35:11.617
What are the odds of the
next card being one of them?

35:11.623 --> 35:13.072
Less than 5%.

35:13.124 --> 35:15.958
Mm-hmm, quite slim. Too bad.

35:24.002 --> 35:25.918
I'll tell you what...

35:25.920 --> 35:27.970
Quit right now,

35:28.006 --> 35:30.556
and I'll save your life...

35:30.591 --> 35:32.642
but Mallory burns.

35:32.677 --> 35:35.177
Come on, Michael.

35:35.229 --> 35:37.596
Take my offer. It's a good one...

35:37.649 --> 35:40.316
A chance to save your life.

35:40.351 --> 35:44.103
My fate lies with the Chosen One, not you.

35:44.155 --> 35:45.938
But how can you be so sure?

35:45.990 --> 35:48.324
Because I have faith.

35:52.613 --> 35:56.032
Three kings.

35:56.084 --> 35:58.668
We had a deal.

36:09.764 --> 36:11.714
This isn't over, is it?

36:11.766 --> 36:16.185
Not until you bring the Chosen One to me.

36:17.138 --> 36:20.690
Mm.

36:20.725 --> 36:22.525
Stars.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.393
The constellation.

36:24.445 --> 36:26.062
Michael, you're okay. What stars?

36:26.114 --> 36:27.396
Where's Alex? I need to see him.

36:27.448 --> 36:29.148
Oh, no.

36:36.541 --> 36:38.324
Claire, are you there?

36:40.078 --> 36:42.912
Yeah, Alex. What's going on?

36:44.082 --> 36:45.498
Claire.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.333
Gates, what's happening?

36:47.335 --> 36:50.252
Don't worry. Gates
Foley never had a problem

36:50.304 --> 36:52.555
that he couldn't fix.

36:52.590 --> 36:55.424
I just wanted to hear your voice.

36:55.476 --> 36:58.894
Gates, what's wrong?

36:58.930 --> 37:02.648
There's no easy way to
say this, Claire, but...

37:04.435 --> 37:05.768
The reactor's overheating,

37:05.820 --> 37:08.521
and I've only got a few minutes left.

37:08.573 --> 37:11.574
Four minutes to core breach.

37:11.609 --> 37:13.776
It's either I go, or we all do.

37:13.828 --> 37:16.078
No.

37:16.114 --> 37:18.030
No, come on, Gates.

37:18.032 --> 37:20.699
You're the smartest man in Vega.

37:20.752 --> 37:22.451
There has got to be another way.

37:22.503 --> 37:24.086
Think. Think.

37:24.122 --> 37:25.421
Claire,

37:25.456 --> 37:27.873
I would love nothing more right now

37:27.875 --> 37:30.042
than to see your face.

37:30.044 --> 37:32.878
You know, if I could find a
way to get back to you, I...

37:34.932 --> 37:38.350
I promise you I would.

37:46.727 --> 37:48.477
I hate dancing.

37:50.565 --> 37:53.399
I don't know why. I always have.

37:55.369 --> 37:58.237
And my favorite food is broccoli.

37:58.239 --> 37:59.905
Oh, broccoli.

37:59.907 --> 38:01.907
The other kids used to make
fun of me, but I like 'em.

38:01.959 --> 38:04.743
They look like little trees.

38:04.745 --> 38:07.379
You don't see many trees in Vega.

38:12.253 --> 38:15.754
I don't want you to go.

38:15.807 --> 38:19.592
Three minutes to core breach.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.644
Yeah, me neither.

38:21.679 --> 38:23.512
You know the last time I felt this tired,

38:23.564 --> 38:27.933
we just finished building
the walls around Vega.

38:27.985 --> 38:32.238
That was the best night's
sleep that I've ever had.

38:33.574 --> 38:35.825
Gates...

38:35.860 --> 38:39.612
Claire, you know that I
love to be right, and I...

38:39.614 --> 38:41.864
I hope that I'm wrong about the Chosen One,

38:41.916 --> 38:45.284
because Vega needs...

38:45.336 --> 38:47.586
Vega needs a reason to keep going...

38:50.675 --> 38:53.375
Just like I needed you.

39:07.308 --> 39:10.059
Thank you.

39:10.111 --> 39:12.394
Gates?

39:16.984 --> 39:18.734
Oh!

39:18.786 --> 39:22.538
Fuel rod alignment complete.
Core temperature lowering.

39:22.573 --> 39:25.124
Gates?

39:55.206 --> 39:58.340
Gates wanted to hear
your voice before he died.

39:59.927 --> 40:02.094
And, um...

40:02.129 --> 40:04.346
he wanted me to give you this.

40:16.060 --> 40:20.779
Thank you for being there with him.

40:26.454 --> 40:27.986
Alex...

40:30.991 --> 40:34.877
Thank you for coming home.

40:41.552 --> 40:45.637
21 years ago when the men and women of Vega

40:45.673 --> 40:47.423
placed the last brick on the East Wall,

40:47.425 --> 40:50.476
we knew these walls would protect us.

40:50.511 --> 40:54.480
But they've also imprisoned us,
turned us against one another.

40:54.515 --> 40:59.101
Wipe that smile off your
face. You'll be next.

40:59.153 --> 41:02.488
Maybe, maybe not.

41:14.201 --> 41:18.203
Our real enemies lie outside these walls...

41:19.957 --> 41:23.542
Those who want to
destroy our way of life...

41:25.379 --> 41:28.764
To silence our humanity.

41:28.799 --> 41:31.800
All humans die.

41:31.852 --> 41:36.305
Citizens of Vega, today I
am abolishing the V system.

41:45.282 --> 41:47.699
Michael, are you okay?

41:47.735 --> 41:49.651
For now. The constellation
in your markings...

41:49.703 --> 41:50.986
Show it to me again.

41:51.038 --> 41:52.738
Even if at times we feel lost...

41:52.790 --> 41:54.573
- That's the newest one.
- When did you get it?

41:54.625 --> 41:56.825
On our way to Vega.

41:56.877 --> 41:58.744
It woke me up.

41:58.796 --> 42:00.496
What's wrong?

42:00.548 --> 42:01.747
It's the Morning Star.

42:01.799 --> 42:03.165
Morning Star?

42:03.217 --> 42:05.050
We called him the Son of Morning...

42:05.085 --> 42:07.169
My older brother, Lucifer.

42:07.221 --> 42:09.922
He's alive.

42:09.974 --> 42:12.057
Lucifer's alive?
