and we only had him

25:30.779 --> 25:33.698
because we'd already picked up
a paedo to fix the food.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.243
A pointless endeavor
because for the eight

25:36.326 --> 25:39.412
miserable years we're gonna be
on this galactic clown show,

25:39.496 --> 25:41.998
there are only rations enough
for half of us.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.291
This is wild.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.751
RYAN: And there's no point
in hurrying back to Earth

25:44.834 --> 25:46.294
because, you know,
even if we could get there,

25:46.378 --> 25:47.587
I'd probably miss it
because I've never

25:47.671 --> 25:50.590
had a flying lesson
in my entire fucking life!

25:50.674 --> 25:51.883
(LAUGHS)

25:51.967 --> 25:54.344
So, we can just say some more
soothing lies into the ca--

25:59.391 --> 26:00.892
-Rav.
-Yeah?

26:02.102 --> 26:04.354
When you finished
the emergency broadcast,

26:04.437 --> 26:07.774
did you, uh, you switch off
the feed by any chance?

26:07.857 --> 26:10.944
Oh, yes. (CHUCKLES)
Yes, definitely.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.488
So, why is--
why is the light still red?

26:13.571 --> 26:14.614
-Why is it red?
-Oh, uh,

26:14.698 --> 26:17.617
red for not recording, right?

26:17.701 --> 26:18.743
Red for not recording.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.870
-No? Is it-- is that no? No?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.081
-Oh, my God. (GASPS)

Ladies and gentlemen...

...what you just heard was--

26:40.098 --> 26:42.934
Well, it was... (MUMBLES)

26:43.018 --> 26:44.936
-Oh, what am I gonna t--
-Um. Um. Uh, uh--

26:45.020 --> 26:46.855
-What am I gonna tell them?
-You're gonna have to say s--
you can't just leave it like--

26:46.938 --> 26:48.606
-We were just rehearsing a play?
-RAV: Just say that.

26:48.690 --> 26:49.941
-Say that, say that.
-You can't say-- just--

26:50.025 --> 26:51.067
You've got to... (CLEARS THROAT)

26:51.151 --> 26:52.652
(SCREEN BEEPS)

26:52.736 --> 26:54.904
(SIGHS) It's all true.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.365
Every word of it, it's all true.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.827
So, now you know everything.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.163
(INHALES) Where do you want
to go from here?
