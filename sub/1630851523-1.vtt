There's definitely
worse ways to go.

Mm, amen.

Shh, I think
it is happening.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.526
Ah. I should sing something
to ease her transition.

from a music festival
in the '60s,

Now what's going

01:22.782 --> 01:24.851
This house was
my pride and joy.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.753
Now it could get sold
to God knows who.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.721

moves in, ya know?

No, no.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.245
There's no catch. As I explained
to your wife on the phone,

01:52.312 --> 01:54.280
her relative passed away
and left her this estate.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.182
Great-Aunt Sophie. I think
I met her when I was a kid,

01:56.249 --> 01:58.418
but I-I thought
she died years ago.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.220
No, no, she just passed.
But the good news is,

02:00.286 --> 02:01.421
you're her next of kin.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.555
Didn't she have a son?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.891
Well, more good news,
he actually did die years ago.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.494
Oh, okay.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.494
Oh, yeah, that's not, um...

02:07.560 --> 02:09.562
How much do you think
we could sell this place for?

02:09.629 --> 02:11.164
Assuming we want to sell.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.633
Uh, yeah, we're not moving
into a 300-year-old house

02:13.700 --> 02:16.803
in the middle of nowhere,
because that would be--

02:16.870 --> 02:18.505
Right, Sam?

02:18.571 --> 02:20.507
Well, it's just
we don't know the facts yet.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.543
Obviously, yes, we're
probably going to sell.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.543
Yeah.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.479
He thinks I'm a little
impulsive.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.479
Ah, just a smidge.

02:26.546 --> 02:27.780

a limited number of buyers

02:27.847 --> 02:29.382

02:29.449 --> 02:31.251
So, you have your bed
and breakfast operators...

02:31.317 --> 02:32.552
(gasps) What if we opened
a bed and breakfast?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.552
(laughs)

02:32.619 --> 02:34.654
Here we go.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.654
Aren't you sick of the city?

02:34.721 --> 02:37.257
No.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.257
We work insane hours
to live in a shoebox

02:37.323 --> 02:38.391
that we can barely afford,

02:38.458 --> 02:40.260
and somebody's offering us
a mansion.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.695
Sam, we don't know the first
thing about running a B and B.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.564
You're a chef. That's, like,
half of the Bs right there.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.633
Plus, I can write freelance
articles from anywhere,

02:46.699 --> 02:48.601

Okay, let's do this.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.874
We haven't seen the place,

so we'll go up there
for the weekend,

02:56.476 --> 02:58.311

02:56.476 --> 02:58.311

I know.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.083
I did a little research.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.852
Apparently, my ancestors
who lived here

06:25.918 --> 06:27.587
were actual robber barons.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.556
Like, cartoon evil,
slept-on-a-bed-of-gold types.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.392

06:33.459 --> 06:35.795
Okay, they actually
seem really nice.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.930

this couple I was married to

06:37.997 --> 06:39.165
when I was on the commune.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.933
And a little of this couple
I was married to

06:41.000 --> 06:42.401
when I was in the cult.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.871
Honestly, it's, like,
way more beat up

I'm telling you, babe,

06:56.582 --> 06:59.418
this place is going to make
an amazing hotel.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.686

07:31.684 --> 07:33.986
(shudders) I hate
getting walked through.

07:34.053 --> 07:35.922
It's probably the worst pain
I can think of.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.758
No, wait, arrow through
the neck. That beats it.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.027
Okay, new plan:

07:41.093 --> 07:42.461
kill them!

07:42.528 --> 07:43.796
Uh, we can't kill them.

07:43.863 --> 07:44.997
Yeah, that's not nice.

07:43.863 --> 07:44.997
ALBERTA:
No, I mean

07:45.064 --> 07:46.666
we don't have the ability.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.801
Can't pick up a gun,
can't put their feet in cement

07:48.868 --> 07:51.604
and drop them off
a country bridge. (chuckles)

07:51.671 --> 07:54.774
I went with a bootlegger
for a spell. You hear things.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.576
Plus, even if we could
physically grapple them,

07:56.642 --> 07:58.778
that husband fellow
would overpower us.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.246
I mean,
have you seen his shoulders

08:00.313 --> 08:01.981
and that V-shaped back?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.521
In summary,
we must do something.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.157
Wait, what--
Why don't we just try...

08:11.224 --> 08:12.758
haunting?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.994
We scare them away.
We're ghosts!

08:15.061 --> 08:16.629
Ooh.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.629
FLOWER:
Whoa!

08:16.696 --> 08:17.964
Yeah!
It's a good plan, right?

08:18.030 --> 08:21.133
Oh, no, sorry, I was just
seeing some major trails.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.668
What are we talking about?

08:22.735 --> 08:24.770
This plan of Trevor's
fills me with discomfort.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.672
The line between
the living and ourselves

08:26.739 --> 08:28.040
is one we should respect.

08:28.107 --> 08:31.177
Who are we to-- (cries out)

08:28.107 --> 08:31.177
(ghosts groaning)

08:31.244 --> 08:33.012
Found my jacket!

08:33.079 --> 08:34.146
(all clamoring)

08:34.213 --> 08:36.182
(cries out)

08:34.213 --> 08:36.182
(ghosts exclaim)

08:36.249 --> 08:38.651
(panting)

08:38.718 --> 08:41.721
All right, let's haunt
these bastards out of here.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.656
(cheering)

08:49.195 --> 08:50.696
JAY:
Hey, Boo-Boo.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.199
The water from
the tap was disgusting.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.199
Oh.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.002
So, I went to the gas station
and I got us some coffee.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.037
Aw, thank you.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.037
Yeah. Carl says hi,

08:58.104 --> 09:00.573
and he called me a snowflake
for wearing flip-flops.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.108
Classic Carl.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.108
Yeah.

09:02.174 --> 09:06.012
Okay, gun to your head:
Canary Yellow or Lavender Mist?

09:06.078 --> 09:08.281
Oh, okay, we're
putting up paint. Nice.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.183
Haven't decided if we're staying
but we're putting up paint.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.885
You know what?
I-I think we should just

09:12.952 --> 09:14.620
knock the whole wall down
while we're at it.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.222
Do you think it's load-bearing?

09:16.289 --> 09:18.858
What? What is this?
What are you doing?

09:18.925 --> 09:20.793
Do you even know what sound
you're listening for?

09:20.860 --> 09:23.162
Not sure, but it makes me feel
like Joanna Gaines,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.563
and I'm not mad at that.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.866
Ooh.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.866
Wanna come be my Chip, big boy?

09:26.933 --> 09:28.601
Um, yes please.

09:28.668 --> 09:32.004
Wait a minute, why do we only
role-play couples from HGTV?

09:32.071 --> 09:35.007
Please don't kink shame me.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.007
(bird cooing)

09:35.074 --> 09:37.243
JAY: Oh, it's adorable.
There's a bird in our room,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.011
because of course there is.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.914
Okay, you're right, this place
needs a little bit of work.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.617
Here he comes!

09:41.981 --> 09:44.617
Hit the deck!

09:48.087 --> 09:51.090
Now, let's take inventory
of the skills at our disposal.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.259
Thor, as we all know,
is able to do that thing

09:53.326 --> 09:56.228
with the electrics because
he was struck by lightning.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.630
(straining)

09:57.697 --> 09:59.699
(electricity crackling)

09:59.765 --> 10:02.368
(cheers and applause)

10:02.435 --> 10:04.036
I am powerful.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.038
Oh, Isaac,
what about your thing?

10:04.103 --> 10:06.038
Yes, yes, yes.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.240
Oh, yes, no, I don't know to
what it is you refer. Okay...

10:08.307 --> 10:09.942
You died of dysentery.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.844
Yeah, it smells like a fart when
the living walk through you.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.212
(laughter)

10:11.911 --> 10:13.212
It's nasty.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.680
You stink, you stink.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.680
It's not pleasant.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.649
(fake laughs) Okay.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.384
I get it. We all get it.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.685
And trust me, you
don't need to be

10:19.752 --> 10:21.053
so harsh in your
condemnations.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.389
It is far worse for me
than it is for thee.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.790
Okay, moving on. What else?

10:24.857 --> 10:26.225
Well, I was thinking
since Alberta

10:26.292 --> 10:29.328
was a singer in life
and can project her humming

10:29.395 --> 10:30.663
into the world of the living,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.898
what if we had her hum the song

10:32.965 --> 10:34.800
from the movie Ghost
to scare them?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.268
Huh? Kinda
thematic, right?

10:36.335 --> 10:37.937
You know we don't
know what that is, Pete.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.672
Oh, right,
the movie thing.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.973
Welcome to my hell.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.108
You guys would
actually love it.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.809
There was this
amazing scene

10:43.876 --> 10:45.011
where the main girl
was making pottery...

10:45.077 --> 10:46.345
We don't have time for this.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.681
And then this hunky,
shirtless guy comes in...

10:48.748 --> 10:49.882
Well, we do have some time.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.150
The haunting isn't imminent.
Go on.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.352
It's fine. I get it.
I'll hum something scary.

10:53.419 --> 10:56.689
Oh, Trevor has to
do his amazing thing.

10:56.756 --> 10:57.957
That must be
the topper.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.725
(all talking at once)

10:58.024 --> 10:59.725
Yeah. Do it!

10:59.792 --> 11:01.894
You're very kind.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.030
ALBERTA:
Come on, Trev.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.737
Oh, sorry, hold on, it's just...

11:09.402 --> 11:11.737
You got it, you got it.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.105
Focus.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.105
Focus, focus.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.105
You got it.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.910
(straining)

11:23.182 --> 11:24.984
(cheering)

11:25.051 --> 11:26.886
Yo, T-money did it!

11:25.051 --> 11:26.886
Scary!

11:26.952 --> 11:29.088
Oh, it's good!

11:29.155 --> 11:31.123
Troops, I believe we are ready.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.727
Tonight, get your sleep,
for tomorrow we strike!

11:34.794 --> 11:36.128
(cheering)

11:34.794 --> 11:36.128
Yes!

11:36.195 --> 11:37.863
(chokes)

11:41.333 --> 11:43.369
(pained shouting)

11:43.436 --> 11:45.137
The hot water's not working!

11:45.204 --> 11:47.273
Okay, people, he's coming out.
Man your posts.

11:47.339 --> 11:51.010
Good luck, everybody.
And have fun!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.747
The hot water's out again.

11:54.814 --> 11:55.915
SAMANTHA:
One second!

11:55.981 --> 11:57.917
And... go, Thor!

11:57.983 --> 11:59.285
(straining)

11:59.351 --> 12:01.020
What the...

12:01.087 --> 12:02.455
Come on.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.190
(straining)

12:04.256 --> 12:06.325
(shouts, groans)

12:06.392 --> 12:07.460
Ah.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.028
Man down!
Alberta, you're up.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.429
Trevor, you're on deck.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.264
You know, it kinda feels
like I'm opening for Trevor.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.800
Now, I don't need to headline
this haunting, but...

12:14.867 --> 12:17.369
Not now!

12:14.867 --> 12:17.369
Ugh, okay. Fine.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.772
(humming)

12:19.839 --> 12:21.474
(humming)

12:21.540 --> 12:23.409
(pop music drowns out humming)

12:21.540 --> 12:23.409
I got the stereo working.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.910
Cool.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.910
Go on.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.345
(whimpers)

12:27.413 --> 12:28.747
(gagging)

12:28.814 --> 12:31.383
(sniffing)

12:28.814 --> 12:31.383
Ugh, babe.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.918
Nice try, that was you.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.253
Are you on a juice cleanse?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.322
Close it out, Trevor.
You're our only hope.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.957
Okay, you can't blame
the other person

12:38.023 --> 12:39.425
when there's only
one other person.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.526
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.128
(crying out)

12:42.194 --> 12:44.096
You know I couldn't
produce that if I tried.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.431
(crying out)

12:44.163 --> 12:45.431
Come on, man!

12:45.498 --> 12:46.799
Bring the fortitude.

12:46.866 --> 12:47.800
That is disgusting.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.869
Oh, come on, you gaslighter.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.771
(Trevor straining)

12:49.935 --> 12:52.771
JAY: You got a cute butt,
but it's got a foul mouth.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.341
(panting)

12:55.407 --> 12:58.043
Huh. Haunting is hard.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.345
Ooh, that is rank.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.180
Shut up.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.180
All right.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.517
Babe? What are you doing?

13:04.583 --> 13:06.085
I'm gonna fix the water heater.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.053
It's probably
just the gas, right?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.089
This has got to be simple,
just turn the pilot on?

13:10.156 --> 13:12.224
SAMANTHA:
This place is so creepy.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.027
Much better.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.795
Who are these guys?

13:15.094 --> 13:16.795
I don't know.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.497
Jay, that looks kinda ancient.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.533
Maybe we should
just call a professional.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.201
No, no.
we're not dumping

13:22.268 --> 13:24.036
a bunch of money
into this house.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.005
Plus, I want to
take a shower now.

13:26.071 --> 13:27.540
Counterclockwise.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.808
Okay, it's just I don't think
you know what you're doing.

13:29.875 --> 13:30.809
(loud squeak)

13:30.876 --> 13:32.011
Uh-oh.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.011
That's not good.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.312
That should do it.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.312
That won't do it.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.014
Think I got it.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.014
He didn't.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.450
At least they left the light on.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.920
Oh.
(chuckles)

13:40.986 --> 13:41.921
(ghosts groan)

13:40.986 --> 13:41.921
Damn it.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.889
(straining)

13:43.956 --> 13:45.324
Trevor?

13:43.956 --> 13:45.324
God.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.126
What-what are you doing?
The livings aren't even here.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.261
No, I know, I know.
This isn't for them.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.463
This is between
T-Money and the vahse.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.199
It's personal.

13:53.265 --> 13:54.466
I've always said vayse.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.303
Can you please...

13:54.533 --> 13:57.303
Sorry.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.338
Aw!

14:01.941 --> 14:03.175
Still freezing.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.610
Okay, well, the good news is

14:04.677 --> 14:06.478
we're going back to New York
this afternoon anyway,

14:06.545 --> 14:08.247
so we can just fix it
when we come back.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.149
You mean if we come back.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.319
Okay, we're having
this conversation.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.121
Sam, um...

14:16.188 --> 14:18.057
I'm just gonna come out
and say it, okay?

14:18.123 --> 14:20.593
(mutters unintelligibly)

14:20.659 --> 14:22.428
Pardon?

14:20.659 --> 14:22.428
(mutters unintelligibly)

14:22.494 --> 14:25.331
I didn't hear you.

14:22.494 --> 14:25.331
I don't want to move here.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.265
(ghosts gasp)

14:26.332 --> 14:27.933
Well, this just got interesting.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.268
Very interesting.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.571
Like finding new type
of cod interesting.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.173
(straining)

14:32.638 --> 14:34.173
Come on.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.475
Okay, a little too close.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.475
Sure. Okay.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.180
Oh, that was--
I was-- That was gonna be it.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.915
That was gonna be it. Really.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.915
I know. I felt that.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.149
That was so
close.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.051
I came up here with
an open mind, for sure,

14:46.118 --> 14:47.987
but this whole bed
and breakfast idea...

14:48.053 --> 14:49.655
I mean, come on.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.323
Do we really want
to leave New York?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.158
Jay, I love you,
but you know that you

14:53.225 --> 14:54.460
get a bit scared of change.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.460
Mm.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.429
But it's okay
to try something different.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.965
Yes, I agree and I'm willing to
try something different...

14:57.496 --> 14:59.965
Yes.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.300
below 14th Street.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.936
(laughs)
He's cute-- Funny!

15:04.003 --> 15:07.640
I don't know what it is but I-I
feel a connection to this place.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.209
I could see a future here,
us raising a family.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.443
I want all that, babe,

15:11.510 --> 15:14.079
but-but, we're in
way over our heads.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.481
This place is falling apart.

15:15.547 --> 15:16.949
It is kind of a dump.

15:17.016 --> 15:17.983
Oh, shut up.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.252
(straining)

15:20.319 --> 15:23.489
(laughing, cheering)

15:23.555 --> 15:24.957
We did it!

15:25.024 --> 15:26.358
(laughing)

15:26.425 --> 15:28.961
So, that's it?
We just do what you want?

15:29.028 --> 15:31.397
If we're both gonna be making
some big crazy move...

15:29.028 --> 15:31.397
Mm-hmm.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.566
...then-then we should at least
both be able to agree on it.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.566
Fine!

15:34.633 --> 15:36.035
But you know what, Jay?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.636
Sometimes you
gotta just do something

15:37.703 --> 15:38.637
a little bold, ya know?

15:38.704 --> 15:40.239
Put some Canary Yellow up

15:40.306 --> 15:42.374
and get out of your
neutral-palette mindset.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.009
What? What are you--
What was that?

15:44.076 --> 15:45.511
Neutrals go with everything.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.313
Haven't you learned anything
from Love It or List It ?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.248
Well, I don't know what
any of those words mean,

15:49.315 --> 15:51.317
but I know that he won't
be laying with her

15:51.383 --> 15:54.219
for several moons!
(laughs)

15:54.286 --> 15:56.388
That was amazing.
You're incredible.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.125
Whoa, whoa, watch out!

16:00.192 --> 16:01.560
(gasps)

16:01.627 --> 16:04.063

16:09.168 --> 16:10.469
Bro, that's not good.

16:09.168 --> 16:10.469
JAY: Sam?

16:10.536 --> 16:12.638
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Sam, hey!

16:12.705 --> 16:16.508
(audio distorted):
Sam. Sam! Oh, my God. Sam!

16:16.575 --> 16:17.576
(Jay's voice fades)

16:27.653 --> 16:28.587
Murderer.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.022
Okay, again,

16:30.089 --> 16:32.458
I didn't mean for her
to trip and fall.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.526
You have to believe me,
I would never intentionally

16:34.593 --> 16:35.761
hurt anyone that hot.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.598
(groans)
Aw, husband guy looks so sad.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.435
I remember when I died.
Ira looked so scared.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.671
Because he didn't want
to lose me.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.540
And also because he was trying
to get away from the bear.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.509
Could you imagine
if she doesn't make it?

16:50.576 --> 16:53.278
What a terrible
last memory for him.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.180
Ending things in an argument.

16:55.247 --> 16:58.350
Carol and I argued
the last time we spoke.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.219
It's funny,
it felt like such a big deal

17:00.285 --> 17:02.354
at the time, and now I...
can't even tell you

17:02.421 --> 17:04.323
what it was
we were arguing about.

17:06.725 --> 17:08.594
PETE:
You never think, when
you close that door behind you,

17:08.660 --> 17:11.196
that that'll be the last time
you walk through that door.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.402
But then I had my accident,
and I realized

17:16.468 --> 17:18.604
I'm never gonna
see my wife again.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.612
I'm never gonna get to
speak to her, to hold her,

17:26.678 --> 17:30.349
to tell her how much I love her.

17:30.416 --> 17:34.319
Oh, wait! I remember
what we were fighting about.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.221
She ate all the donut holes,

17:36.288 --> 17:37.656
and she doesn't even
like donut holes.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.292
It was just to spite me.
Which was just like her,

17:40.359 --> 17:42.161
that selfish so-and-so.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.296
(gasps) Pete.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.296
(exhales)

17:46.899 --> 17:49.168
Uh, the point is...

17:49.234 --> 17:52.171
life is precious.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.139
What is donut hole?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.508
It's just a round donut--

17:56.575 --> 17:58.577
It's what's miss--
It doesn't matter.

Yeah, I just wanted to swing
by the house real quick

18:54.600 --> 18:55.834
and show you something.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.769
So, while you were sleeping
for two weeks...

18:57.836 --> 19:00.572
Coma.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.572
Coma. I had a
contractor come in

19:00.639 --> 19:02.474
just to give us an estimate
on what needs to be done.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.209
And guess what.
It's way more

19:04.276 --> 19:05.577

ever imagined.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.479
It's like a new foundation,
it's new floors...

Jay, it's fine.
You know, I'm okay with

19:08.847 --> 19:10.249
selling the place.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.451
I had some time to think,
and you were right.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.353
I think the whole
bed and breakfast idea

19:14.419 --> 19:16.755
was probably crazy.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.755
Well, then, call me crazy,

That's the contractor.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.198
If we're gonna make
a go of this,

19:26.265 --> 19:27.566

19:28.734 --> 19:29.868
We're staying?!

19:29.935 --> 19:31.837
We're doubling down, baby!

19:31.904 --> 19:34.640
I maxed out the credit cards,
I cashed in the IRA,

19:34.706 --> 19:36.708
despite the very vocal
objections of my father.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.510
News flash:
we're deeply in debt.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.646

What happened?

Almost losing you made me
realize that I don't care

where we live, because as
long as I'm with you,

19:49.254 --> 19:50.589

Did it sound corny?

I practiced it.

I did miss those crazy kids.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.880
She talked to me! She
talked to me! She talked to me.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.949
And I think she kinda hit on me,
I'm not entirely sure,

20:51.016 --> 20:52.017
but there was definitely
a spark.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.685

Good God.

Please, lower your hands.

Uh-uh, what is that?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.396
That is the Canary Yellow
you wanted.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.732
You painted the room.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.732
I know, I know.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.300
You know, I wasn't sure
about it at first,

21:08.367 --> 21:10.302
but it's growing on me.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.671
What the hell?

Yeah, yeah, you're right.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.740
It's a lot of yellow.
Oh, you know what we could do?

21:14.806 --> 21:17.042
We could put up
a muted accent wall.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.877
This can't be real.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.712
