WEBVTT

00:00.234 --> 00:01.750
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:01.851 --> 00:03.053
You preaching on Sunday?

00:03.154 --> 00:04.854
I don't preach anymore.

00:04.955 --> 00:06.489
You are Grace Greenleaf, ain't you?

00:06.590 --> 00:08.092
Daddy.

00:08.117 --> 00:10.226
Promise me you're not
here to sow discord.

00:10.327 --> 00:13.430
Because Jesus wants to welcome you home!

00:14.178 --> 00:16.599
Now he's the senior senator
from Tennessee.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.437
I think he's coming to ask me about
David Nelson, that trigger-happy cop,

00:20.538 --> 00:22.005
but I've never even met the man.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.373
The Senate is launching an inquiry

00:23.474 --> 00:25.075
into whether your church
and others like it

00:25.176 --> 00:27.377
are taking advantage
of your tax-exempt status.

00:27.478 --> 00:29.079
You better tell that little side piece

00:29.180 --> 00:31.581
to stop texting so damn much.

00:31.682 --> 00:33.016
You didn't lose my sister, Mama.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.285
You gave her away!

00:35.386 --> 00:36.653
One of the cops who works around here

00:36.754 --> 00:39.355
told me about a 15-year-old girl

00:39.457 --> 00:41.724
- from the church.
- He did it again?

00:41.826 --> 00:43.560
Just like Faith.

00:43.661 --> 00:45.395
I don't think he ever really stopped.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.603
So, what's in here?

00:53.704 --> 00:55.805
Girl's name, phone number,

00:55.906 --> 00:58.308
address, statements...

00:58.409 --> 00:59.709
the ones she made the first time

00:59.810 --> 01:01.311
and when she recanted.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.713
He just gave this to you?

01:03.814 --> 01:07.584
He is a she, and she gets it.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.571
Your Uncle Mac raped this child.

01:14.024 --> 01:16.326
Now, Gigi, God's giving
you a second chance.

01:16.983 --> 01:18.383
Take it.

02:11.483 --> 02:15.018
No human being's ever
been perfect since Jesus.

02:15.119 --> 02:16.519
He was the only one.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.888
Expecting people to be perfect is...

02:18.989 --> 02:20.169
is like...

02:21.492 --> 02:24.027
expecting an apple to taste
like a cheeseburger.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.895
And when you're disappointed in people,

02:27.245 --> 02:29.565
the one you should turn to is God.

02:30.365 --> 02:34.370
This life that's given us
is not about perfection...

02:36.340 --> 02:37.840
it's about love.

02:37.942 --> 02:39.209
Faith.

02:53.824 --> 02:56.226
That's the last of the boxes.
Can you sign here for me?

03:08.505 --> 03:10.006
What do you want me to do with these?

03:13.444 --> 03:14.677
Nothing.

03:31.528 --> 03:34.197
- Hello?
- Pastor Greenleaf!

03:34.298 --> 03:37.767
- Good morning!
- Bishop Greenleaf, hey.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.769
I hope I'm not interrupting
your prayer time

03:39.870 --> 03:41.004
or anything like that.

03:41.105 --> 03:44.140
Nope, just finishing up.

03:45.221 --> 03:46.276
What's up?

03:46.377 --> 03:49.112
I'm putting you in charge of the
deacon board as of right now.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.949
- Why?
- Because it's time.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.618
- What's he want?
- Your mother thought this was news

03:55.719 --> 03:56.919
you'd feel blessed to receive.

03:57.021 --> 03:58.621
Yeah, I... I do.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.723
- I just wasn't expecting it.
- Jacob.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.559
I'm sorry. One second. Kerissa is...

04:03.661 --> 04:06.596
- What? - What does he want you to do?

04:06.697 --> 04:08.264
Take over the deacon board.

04:08.365 --> 04:11.067
Well, just say yes.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.435
Thank you and yes.

04:12.536 --> 04:14.470
But the deacons don't respect me.

04:14.571 --> 04:16.572
How about you make them respect you?

04:17.086 --> 04:18.308
Jacob, with Grace home,

04:18.409 --> 04:21.344
now is the time for you
to step up, not back.

04:25.983 --> 04:28.131
- Can't wait to get started.
- Good!

04:29.486 --> 04:31.220
Carry on.

04:31.322 --> 04:32.689
As we get more information,

04:32.790 --> 04:34.357
we of course will keep you updated

04:34.458 --> 04:36.526
as to the developments
in the Kenny Collins shooting.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.695
Later in this broadcast
we'll hear from expert...

04:38.796 --> 04:40.591
Just dropping off my daughter.

04:41.398 --> 04:42.665
Thank you.

04:48.005 --> 04:49.706
I hate my legs.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.207
Oh, come on, you look great.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.043
Wow.

04:54.144 --> 04:55.741
Dad might be calling you.

04:56.613 --> 04:57.580
Why?

04:58.315 --> 05:00.383
He wants to know why you
didn't take the job at "20/20"

05:00.484 --> 05:03.219
and why we moved here and not New York.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.321
I think he's worried
I'm going to turn into

05:05.422 --> 05:06.689
some kind of religious fanatic.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.359
Okay, I'll talk to him. Wow.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.767
Honey, your legs are fine.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.135
You're beautiful.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.272
Have a great first day, okay?

05:40.591 --> 05:42.892
So, we have prison outreach,
campus outreach,

05:42.993 --> 05:45.795
youth outreach, and homeless outreach.

05:45.896 --> 05:47.029
That's a lot of outreach.

05:47.131 --> 05:48.931
Well, the Lord has done

05:49.032 --> 05:50.833
a lot of reaching out to Calvary, amen?

05:50.934 --> 05:54.804
- Mm-hmm.
- So, we got to be passing it on.

05:54.905 --> 05:56.339
- Yeah. Hey.
- Grand tour, huh?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.509
- Yes. Very impressive.
- Hey, Pop.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.879
Alexa, can you stop by my
office when you're done here?

06:02.980 --> 06:04.947
I need some help resetting my password.

06:05.048 --> 06:06.949
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks.

06:07.050 --> 06:08.985
Grace, great to have you back, sis.

06:09.086 --> 06:12.488
- Thank you.
- All right, so here's your Calvary cell

06:12.589 --> 06:14.724
and some literature about our programs.

06:14.825 --> 06:16.959
And then I had the response coordinator

06:17.060 --> 06:18.928
schedule just one meeting today.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.056
- Who is she meeting?
- Betty Wilcox.

06:21.157 --> 06:23.263
Ah, the Bishop's Roundtable.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.868
- Which is...?
- It's a club for members

06:25.969 --> 06:29.772
who give $10,000 or more
over and above their tithe.

06:29.873 --> 06:31.641
So, round like nice round number, huh?

06:31.742 --> 06:33.776
There's nothing wrong
with recognizing those

06:33.877 --> 06:36.512
whose faith inspires them
to great deeds.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.983
Not everybody made it into the Bible.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.607
- Call if you need anything.
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.825
Where'd you find her?

06:44.488 --> 06:47.010
She used to date a center
with the Memphis Grizzlies.

06:47.858 --> 06:49.682
You wanted that NBA money.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.761
I wanted an executive secretary

06:51.862 --> 06:53.763
- with a heart for Jesus.
- Uh-huh.

06:53.864 --> 06:55.731
Watch that cynical habit of thought.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.636
- Good morning, Darlene.
- Good morning, Bishop.

07:07.411 --> 07:08.978
After you, Pastor.

07:11.548 --> 07:13.015
Yeah.

07:13.588 --> 07:15.588
I just wanted to give a little advice.

07:15.924 --> 07:17.977
Now, we both know you were
a heck of a preacher.

07:18.079 --> 07:19.794
- Oh, I was fine, Daddy.
- No, no, no.

07:19.895 --> 07:23.264
You were on the path to be
my equal or surpass me.

07:23.365 --> 07:25.266
And who knows? It may come to that.

07:25.367 --> 07:28.245
But this isn't preaching.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.405
This is ministry.

07:30.506 --> 07:31.939
From what Jacob tells me,

07:32.041 --> 07:33.508
it's pretty much just directing people

07:33.609 --> 07:34.976
to the right program or auxiliary.

07:35.077 --> 07:36.244
And that is not untrue.

07:36.345 --> 07:38.246
But what your brother, as usual,

07:38.347 --> 07:39.974
fails to comprehend

07:40.616 --> 07:42.573
is that when you're the response pastor,

07:43.052 --> 07:45.586
you are the face of the
church with a capital "C".

07:45.956 --> 07:47.288
You are the first person

07:47.389 --> 07:49.123
these people down here experience

07:49.224 --> 07:50.892
when they're looking
for help from above.

07:51.186 --> 07:53.046
That's not as glamorous as preaching,

07:53.996 --> 07:56.148
but it's more important.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.965
So, what's your advice?

08:01.637 --> 08:02.937
Before you pick up the phone,

08:03.038 --> 08:04.681
before you dial a number,

08:05.407 --> 08:07.075
before you set an appointment,

08:07.176 --> 08:08.943
before you feed a dollar

08:09.044 --> 08:10.478
into that machine
at the end of the hall,

08:10.579 --> 08:14.057
before you do anything, check your heart

08:14.650 --> 08:16.994
and make sure that
you're acting from love,

08:18.353 --> 08:20.655
because Jesus never did anything, Gigi,

08:20.756 --> 08:24.926
that wasn't dipped down in and
dripping with love for human beings.

08:26.829 --> 08:28.346
We are his beloved.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.601
I'll be nice to Sister Wilcox.

08:33.702 --> 08:34.916
That's all I'm asking.

08:35.015 --> 08:35.890
Okay.

08:35.991 --> 08:39.207
And put something up on these walls.

08:39.308 --> 08:41.509
I feel like I'm losing a little
faith just sitting in here.

08:44.011 --> 08:46.347
And, you know, Jacob was
right about one thing.

08:46.448 --> 08:48.049
Hmm?

08:48.630 --> 08:50.109
It's good having you back.

08:55.858 --> 08:57.214
Darlene...

08:58.494 --> 09:00.895
the combination
of the colors of that dress

09:00.996 --> 09:03.164
against the tone of
your skin is a good...

09:10.906 --> 09:14.208
You have three new messages.

09:14.309 --> 09:15.830
Hi! This fall,

09:15.855 --> 09:17.569
Broadway is coming to Memphis

09:17.646 --> 09:20.214
and you're...

09:20.315 --> 09:22.740
Hey, this is David Nelson.

09:23.685 --> 09:26.787
I've been trying to reach Bishop
Greenleaf for a month or so.

09:26.889 --> 09:28.656
I've left messages and never heard back,

09:28.757 --> 09:30.733
so I thought I'd try this number.

09:31.426 --> 09:35.069
If someone from the church could give
me a call back, I'd appreciate it.

09:35.564 --> 09:37.365
Just have a couple questions.

09:41.199 --> 09:43.199
_

09:48.325 --> 09:50.325
_

10:02.891 --> 10:06.327
1,000 meters above sea level,
this is the air pressure.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.598
What I want to know is how
would you use the FTC

10:10.699 --> 10:12.925
to determine the air
pressure at sea level?

10:16.972 --> 10:18.491
Mr. Davis...

10:19.708 --> 10:22.310
is there some breaking news about
the calculus you're tracking?

10:22.411 --> 10:26.414
Uh, no, I'm just going over some
last-minute logistics for the march.

10:26.515 --> 10:29.317
Mr. Davis, we all understand the
import of the Kenny Collins case,

10:29.418 --> 10:31.586
and I applaud the way you're taking a
part in the public response, but...

10:31.687 --> 10:34.555
Well, there it is.

10:34.656 --> 10:36.958
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Read chapter four in Boyer

10:37.059 --> 10:38.759
and do worksheet 17 for tomorrow.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.528
And remember, what do we do?

10:40.629 --> 10:42.394
Show your work.

10:43.165 --> 10:45.533
- Miss Greenleaf.
- Hi.

10:45.634 --> 10:49.570
You can read chapter one of Du Bois
tonight, too, and respond.

10:49.671 --> 10:51.472
Is that a math book?

10:51.573 --> 10:54.108
No, but it's required reading
in any class of mine.

10:54.209 --> 10:58.265
- One page.
- Welcome to Black Excellence.

10:59.748 --> 11:00.948
They want everything...

11:01.049 --> 11:02.416
audited financial statements,

11:02.517 --> 11:04.385
names of all church board members,

11:04.486 --> 11:06.821
a list of all executive
compensation, housing allowances,

11:06.922 --> 11:09.991
credit card statements, a list of
all vehicles owned by the church,

11:10.092 --> 11:12.860
all properties, all church
bank accounts, investments,

11:12.961 --> 11:15.329
an explanation of how
church funds are distributed,

11:15.430 --> 11:17.999
and an accounting of all
donations made since 2010.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.102
That all?

11:23.105 --> 11:26.374
Well, he won't be getting any of that.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.745
Okay, so what do you want me

11:30.846 --> 11:32.680
to tell Senator Banks's office?

11:32.781 --> 11:35.209
- Nothing.
- Don't even respond?

11:35.234 --> 11:39.519
Nope. See, we're going to give
Senator Banks a gift, Alexa.

11:39.621 --> 11:42.290
We're going to help him see the
limits of his earthly jurisdiction.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.392
Now, my guess is at first
it's going to be painful,

11:45.494 --> 11:48.296
but when Senator Banks
realizes with holy relief

11:48.397 --> 11:50.464
that he needn't trouble
himself any further

11:50.565 --> 11:53.062
with how we do things
in the garden of the Lord,

11:53.769 --> 11:57.271
- he's going to be soothed.
- Eventually.

11:57.372 --> 11:59.307
I'm just going to draw my line and say,

11:59.408 --> 12:01.876
"Satan, no further."

12:03.979 --> 12:06.681
- Okay.
- Good. Thank you.

12:06.782 --> 12:08.249
Carry on.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.787
Like I would give him any of that.

12:15.190 --> 12:16.652
That boy must have a demon.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.227
Well, what can I do for you two today?

12:20.329 --> 12:23.664
My granddaughter needs baptizing.

12:23.765 --> 12:27.268
Oh, good! Okay, well,
that's nice and simple.

12:27.982 --> 12:29.670
I am sure you are looking forward

12:29.771 --> 12:31.305
to decorating in here.

12:31.406 --> 12:34.675
There's so much freedom.

12:34.776 --> 12:36.077
All right, here we go.

12:36.178 --> 12:38.813
And what is this young lady's name?

12:38.914 --> 12:41.349
- Erica.
- Erica.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.150
- And you're her grandmother?
- That's correct.

12:43.251 --> 12:44.618
Okay. Excellent. Her mother is...

12:44.720 --> 12:46.454
She's on vacation.

12:46.555 --> 12:48.089
Vacation.

12:48.190 --> 12:49.323
And her father?

12:49.424 --> 12:52.226
He's not a part of this family.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.705
Okay.

12:55.731 --> 12:59.033
- And when were you hoping to do this?
- Today.

13:01.436 --> 13:03.073
Is that a problem?

13:03.839 --> 13:05.806
You don't want to wait until your
daughter is back from vacation?

13:05.907 --> 13:09.080
Is it a requirement
that she should be present?

13:09.845 --> 13:12.546
I talked with Darlene and she
never mentioned that to me.

13:12.647 --> 13:16.951
No, I just... does your
daughter even know

13:17.052 --> 13:18.586
that you're baptizing her baby?

13:18.687 --> 13:21.122
You know, I probably need to
see the bishop about this.

13:21.223 --> 13:23.124
I'm sure that he will
have no problems with it.

13:23.225 --> 13:24.725
No, that's not necessary.

13:24.826 --> 13:26.827
I was...

13:29.231 --> 13:31.365
Let's get this one
on the books, shall we?

13:31.466 --> 13:33.134
Ms. Wilcox, this is exciting.

13:36.471 --> 13:37.653
Hey.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.408
You never came and found me.

13:40.509 --> 13:41.942
I just got done.

13:44.846 --> 13:47.381
- Unforgettable.
- What's unforgettable?

13:47.482 --> 13:50.151
Your new password. "Unforgettable."

13:53.255 --> 13:55.372
I didn't really forget my old one.

13:56.258 --> 13:57.725
Mm-hmm.

13:57.826 --> 13:59.241
I wanted to know if I could
come over tomorrow night.

13:59.341 --> 14:01.162
I have to lead the meeting
of the deacon board,

14:01.263 --> 14:02.797
and I can tell Kerissa it ran late.

14:05.267 --> 14:06.634
Do you want me to make food?

14:07.087 --> 14:10.004
No, just make the bed.

14:14.075 --> 14:15.176
Okay.

14:19.281 --> 14:21.482
Well, what do you think?

14:23.885 --> 14:26.020
Is it good enough
for a day with Lady Mae?

14:26.961 --> 14:28.817
It's lovely.

14:29.257 --> 14:31.358
Rather small.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.761
Seems as if he's given us three nuts.

14:33.862 --> 14:36.430
You have two, unless one is hiding.

14:36.531 --> 14:38.165
Oh, well.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.700
I can have Philippe size up the portions

14:39.801 --> 14:40.968
if that's an issue.

14:41.069 --> 14:42.803
Unfortunately, it is.

14:42.904 --> 14:46.373
You and I eat sensibly,
but not every woman does.

14:46.475 --> 14:48.777
Now, this chef is a friend of yours?

14:49.111 --> 14:51.127
Jacob and I see him socially, yes.

14:51.228 --> 14:54.369
Oh. A bit of a miniaturist, isn't he?

14:56.251 --> 14:57.952
Well, what is your message
going to be this year?

14:58.053 --> 14:59.401
We're all wondering.

15:00.055 --> 15:01.856
Proverbs 31...

15:01.957 --> 15:03.290
the virtuous woman.

15:03.924 --> 15:05.993
But don't tell, of course.

15:06.094 --> 15:07.842
Oh, I would never.

15:09.231 --> 15:10.827
Will Grace attend, you think?

15:13.034 --> 15:14.235
Why wouldn't she?

15:14.827 --> 15:16.103
Oh, no reason.

15:16.204 --> 15:18.305
It's just that, you know,
she's independent...

15:18.406 --> 15:21.642
I think she'd know that her
presence would be required.

15:21.773 --> 15:22.779
Oh.

15:24.045 --> 15:26.180
I have to admit, when Jacob told me

15:26.281 --> 15:29.183
that she decided to stay and serve
the church again, I was confused.

15:29.284 --> 15:31.619
This salmon will be properly
sized, won't it, though?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.220
I mean, it won't be...

15:33.321 --> 15:35.222
If it's not, we will serve two

15:35.323 --> 15:38.859
and we'll call it a salmon duet.

15:39.385 --> 15:40.693
So creative.

15:42.531 --> 15:44.398
Anyway, I was actually confused...

15:44.499 --> 15:45.699
So you said.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.049
Yes,

15:47.636 --> 15:50.604
just about why Grace is choosing
to serve the church again

15:50.705 --> 15:54.808
when her beliefs
are obviously not in line

15:54.910 --> 15:59.446
with anything that I understand
as doctrine, that's for sure.

15:59.548 --> 16:01.615
The bishop believes she has a call,

16:01.716 --> 16:04.752
and in matters of spiritual
discernment, I follow his lead.

16:07.455 --> 16:09.423
Has she expressed an interest
in preaching again?

16:09.524 --> 16:10.691
Oh, my...

16:10.792 --> 16:11.926
Well, I'm only asking because...

16:12.027 --> 16:15.563
- Kerissa.
- Yes?

16:15.664 --> 16:18.365
Strength like yours, dear,

16:18.466 --> 16:21.502
is best expressed in stillness.

16:24.645 --> 16:27.474
And then we go out to
"Onward, Christian Soldiers."

16:27.576 --> 16:28.842
Brilliant.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.245
Nigel, can we discuss the postlude?

16:31.346 --> 16:33.847
I've got an appointment
I've got to get to.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.250
Yeah, I was just thinking

16:36.351 --> 16:38.885
that maybe we could
try something different.

16:39.588 --> 16:41.522
For the seven years that
I've been choir director,

16:41.623 --> 16:43.791
we've done "Christian Soldiers"
for postlude,

16:43.892 --> 16:45.526
or have I been dreaming?

16:45.627 --> 16:47.127
No, you've been wide awake.

16:47.228 --> 16:49.496
We are not changing the postlude.

16:50.850 --> 16:54.335
Nigel, as Minister of Music,
I'm well within my rights

16:54.436 --> 16:57.608
to ask you to modify
the order of worship.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.640
I only let you run things to be nice.

16:59.741 --> 17:01.041
So why stop now?

17:01.142 --> 17:04.078
Because "Christian Soldiers"
is a boring old hymn

17:04.179 --> 17:06.646
and we're over it.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.317
Fine.

17:10.417 --> 17:12.019
You two decide how you want to shatter

17:12.119 --> 17:13.820
a liturgical structure that
I've spent nearly a decade

17:13.922 --> 17:15.856
building in the hearts of our members.

17:15.957 --> 17:19.126
Just let me know what song my choir
should sing as it crashes down

17:20.026 --> 17:21.627
and then I'll pick up the pieces.

17:30.939 --> 17:32.306
What got into you today?

17:32.407 --> 17:34.475
Oh, I don't know.

17:34.576 --> 17:35.709
Can you keep a secret?

17:35.810 --> 17:37.511
I never told anybody that one...

17:37.612 --> 17:39.298
Now, Wanda...

17:40.382 --> 17:43.317
Kevin and I are trying to have a baby.

17:43.418 --> 17:44.918
I'm getting my mama on.

17:45.020 --> 17:49.223
- Well, look out, Calvary.
- Right? Amen.

17:49.324 --> 17:51.492
And how many nights a week would
y'all be needing the space?

17:51.593 --> 17:54.061
- Wednesdays and Fridays.
- Okay. That works.

17:54.162 --> 17:55.963
- And how many...
- Clients.

17:56.064 --> 17:58.499
...clients does your organization
generally host per night?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.300
Usually about 75 to 100.

18:00.402 --> 18:02.903
Okay. Men? Women? Families?

18:03.004 --> 18:04.705
Most of our partners like to alternate.

18:04.806 --> 18:06.907
Men one week,
women and children the next.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.543
You'd give them dinner,
a bed, breakfast,

18:09.644 --> 18:12.158
and we'd be out of your space by 9 A.M.

18:14.416 --> 18:16.017
Okay, then. Let's do it.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.196
Really? It's that simple?

18:18.297 --> 18:19.186
We're a church. This is what we do.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.782
That is... that is fantastic.

18:23.274 --> 18:24.790
I look forward
to working with you, Kevin.

18:24.891 --> 18:26.326
Yeah, me, too.

18:29.431 --> 18:31.021
Well, um...

18:31.866 --> 18:33.033
I hope to see you soon.

18:33.134 --> 18:35.035
Yeah, same.

18:44.595 --> 18:46.219
Well, congratulations.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.343
I couldn't be happier for you both.

18:48.444 --> 18:50.579
Hmm? All the time.

18:52.682 --> 18:54.049
Okay, bye, now.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.419
What house they buy?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.354
That big gray one on
Martin Road in Germantown

18:59.455 --> 19:01.456
near where Morgan Freeman's
place used to be.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.642
No.

19:03.326 --> 19:05.790
Horace and Clara Jackson
bought that house?

19:05.891 --> 19:06.762
With cash.

19:07.529 --> 19:09.211
While the Lord makes do

19:09.313 --> 19:10.732
with that old rickety jet of ours.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.227
- Oh, Mae.
- It's interesting, that's all.

19:16.597 --> 19:19.368
Oh. What can I do for you, Pastor?

19:19.800 --> 19:21.100
Come on.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.870
You said at dinner
the day that we buried Faith

19:23.971 --> 19:26.572
that David Nelson never
contacted you, never called.

19:27.201 --> 19:28.407
He hadn't, far as I know.

19:28.508 --> 19:32.678
Okay, well, I found a message on
my phone this morning from him

19:32.779 --> 19:35.248
saying that he tried reaching
you over and over again.

19:35.349 --> 19:36.682
Well, this is the first
I've heard of it.

19:36.783 --> 19:39.585
Some folk around here
sometime make an effort

19:39.686 --> 19:42.255
to protect me from
my own heedless integrity.

19:42.356 --> 19:44.370
I'm sure whoever took those calls

19:44.471 --> 19:46.692
thought that having an
association with that officer

19:46.793 --> 19:49.317
might be bad for the church
and didn't inform me.

19:50.116 --> 19:51.564
So what do you want me to do?

19:52.512 --> 19:54.100
Nothing.

19:56.169 --> 19:57.433
What about passing it on?

19:57.534 --> 19:59.854
What about pearls before swine?

20:00.340 --> 20:02.310
A man is allowed to be discerning.

20:02.776 --> 20:05.745
A pastor is required to be.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.113
Mm-hmm.

20:10.235 --> 20:11.401
How'd it go with Sister Wilcox?

20:12.265 --> 20:14.052
Great. She's coming in tomorrow

20:14.154 --> 20:15.821
so you can baptize her granddaughter.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.857
- Oh.
- You can do it.

20:17.958 --> 20:19.492
Oh, no, she'd much prefer
that you did it.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.460
Just baptize the baby.

20:22.161 --> 20:23.562
'Cause she's Bishop's Roundtable?

20:23.664 --> 20:26.699
Because it's your job...
a job that you asked for

20:26.800 --> 20:28.658
and that your father gave you.

20:30.404 --> 20:31.804
This is what I meant, Gigi,

20:31.905 --> 20:33.973
when I was talking about the difference

20:34.074 --> 20:36.409
between preaching and pastoring.

20:39.913 --> 20:41.047
Fine.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.051
Mama.

20:56.196 --> 20:58.831
I told you this was a mistake.

20:58.932 --> 21:02.501
Oh, my God, Nikki was so T.T.
last night.

21:02.602 --> 21:05.104
Rashan was like,
"Please, get your girl!"

21:05.205 --> 21:08.240
Did y'all see how she was all
over that guy from Raleigh-Egypt?

21:08.342 --> 21:11.310
Right? And she really thought
she was piping it up, though.

21:11.411 --> 21:13.312
Like, I was like, "Honey, boom."

21:13.413 --> 21:17.906
- Have several seats.
- What's T.T.?

21:18.785 --> 21:20.052
You've never heard T.T.?

21:20.674 --> 21:22.087
No.

21:22.826 --> 21:24.092
Where's she from again?

21:24.193 --> 21:25.540
- Phoenix.
- Arizona.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.796
It's, like, when you're,
you know, like too turnt.

21:30.897 --> 21:33.566
Yeah, too turnt up?

21:35.435 --> 21:37.336
Oh, yeah. Got it.

21:37.437 --> 21:38.604
How do y'all say it in Arizona?

21:38.705 --> 21:41.240
Um, I mean, I'd...

21:41.341 --> 21:43.275
- I guess we'd say...
- Crunk.

21:43.377 --> 21:46.746
- Crunk.
- Oh!

21:46.847 --> 21:48.914
Crunk, crunk.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.750
Crunk, crunk, crunk, crunk.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.451
It's just a joke.

22:19.746 --> 22:21.647
Could you state your name, please?

22:22.295 --> 22:23.950
Danielle Turner.

22:24.651 --> 22:26.184
And your age?

22:27.654 --> 22:28.999
15.

22:30.257 --> 22:31.757
Can you tell me about the night

22:31.858 --> 22:34.226
between you and Mr. McCready?

22:38.465 --> 22:41.297
He took me out to the church's camp.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.938
He said he was just going
to teach me how to fish.

22:48.442 --> 22:52.144
Then when I threw out the fishing pole,

22:52.245 --> 22:53.961
he took it out of my hand.

22:55.489 --> 22:59.736
And then he started kissing me.

23:01.555 --> 23:03.355
And what happened after that?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.559
I told him to stop.

23:08.895 --> 23:10.664
And what did he do?

23:12.466 --> 23:15.640
He just kept kissing me
harder and harder.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.744
It hurt.

23:18.872 --> 23:21.641
Then he put his hands
down my pants and...

23:22.642 --> 23:24.777
It's okay. Take your time.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.040
I told him I'd tell.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.451
He didn't care.

23:32.552 --> 23:34.520
Mr. McCready wasn't at all concerned

23:34.621 --> 23:37.352
that you might tell someone
what he had done to you?

23:37.958 --> 23:39.015
No.

23:39.926 --> 23:41.240
Why not?

23:42.095 --> 23:44.363
He said no one would believe me.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.351
Uh-huh. Yeah, I miss you, too.

24:03.850 --> 24:05.985
Well, I knew you staying over
was going to be trouble.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.954
Well, no, it was a good trouble,

24:09.055 --> 24:11.123
but, I mean, I'm here
and you're there, so...

24:12.959 --> 24:14.627
Hey, let me call you right back.
Someone's at the door.

24:16.963 --> 24:18.731
Oh, hey, Gigi.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.733
Hey, is it too late to stop by?

24:21.207 --> 24:23.031
No. What's up?

24:23.904 --> 24:25.237
You sure this isn't a bad time?

24:25.338 --> 24:27.006
No. I was just on the phone with Isabel.

24:27.107 --> 24:28.240
What's going on?

24:28.341 --> 24:29.842
Oh, nothing. It can wait. It can wait.

24:29.943 --> 24:31.777
No, if it's something quick.

24:34.948 --> 24:36.382
- Okay, yeah.
- Come on in.

24:42.322 --> 24:43.656
I wanted to know what happens

24:43.757 --> 24:45.224
if someone lodges a legal complaint

24:45.325 --> 24:47.226
or a civil suit against
someone in the church?

24:47.327 --> 24:48.861
Does that go through your office?

24:48.962 --> 24:50.396
Is that something security handles?

24:50.497 --> 24:53.232
Only if the initial incident
occurs on church property.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.767
Why? Something happen today?

24:54.868 --> 24:57.870
No. No, I was just wondering

24:57.971 --> 24:59.991
where the records on stuff
like that are kept.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.208
I'm just getting situated.

25:02.309 --> 25:03.475
Oh, okay, cool.

25:03.577 --> 25:05.644
Yeah, no, I'm only the point person

25:05.745 --> 25:08.180
if something happens like a break-in

25:08.281 --> 25:11.136
or a cold snap and someone
slips on the ice.

25:11.751 --> 25:13.018
Are you sure everything's okay?

25:13.119 --> 25:14.286
Yeah.

25:15.626 --> 25:16.623
Yeah.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.858
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.494
No, no. It's no bother, really.

25:22.596 --> 25:25.898
- It's...
- And please apologize to Isabel for me.

25:25.999 --> 25:29.301
I... or not. Whatever, you know.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.600
I will. You got it.

25:32.772 --> 25:34.640
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:51.024 --> 25:54.093
All right, time for you to sleep.

25:54.194 --> 25:56.061
I should, but I can't.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.568
What's the matter?

26:04.804 --> 26:06.071
I've done three hours of homework

26:06.172 --> 26:08.073
and I have another hour to go on this.

26:08.174 --> 26:11.277
I've gone from being the only
black girl at an all-white school

26:11.378 --> 26:13.312
to being the only white girl
at an all-black school.

26:13.413 --> 26:14.680
I have to wear a school uniform

26:14.781 --> 26:16.749
that makes me look like a hippo,

26:16.850 --> 26:18.317
and you still haven't
explained why we moved here

26:18.418 --> 26:19.885
to be with all these
people that you hate.

26:19.986 --> 26:21.954
No, I don't hate anybody.

26:22.055 --> 26:23.455
You stayed away for 20 years.

26:23.556 --> 26:24.790
Yeah, and when we talked about staying,

26:24.891 --> 26:26.492
I told you that that was a mistake.

26:26.593 --> 26:27.726
Well, it was your mistake.

26:29.195 --> 26:30.396
It wasn't mine.

26:35.602 --> 26:37.142
I want to live with Dad.

26:38.611 --> 26:39.744
You told him that?

26:41.374 --> 26:44.267
No, but I'm going to...

26:46.012 --> 26:48.280
as soon as I finish my homework,

26:48.381 --> 26:50.683
which will be never.

26:56.455 --> 26:59.682
"Do you desire to have ect
this child baptized?"

27:00.425 --> 27:02.860
"Do you desire to have
this child baptized?"

27:05.997 --> 27:07.898
"Do you promise with
your prayers and witness

27:07.999 --> 27:10.501
to help this child grow into
the full stature of Christ?"

27:10.602 --> 27:11.936
Yes.

27:12.037 --> 27:14.472
"Do you promise with
your prayers and witness..."

27:17.776 --> 27:19.443
"Do you promise with
your prayers and witness

27:19.544 --> 27:22.746
to help this child grow into
the full stature of Christ?"

27:26.785 --> 27:28.118
Sure. Why not?

27:33.317 --> 27:35.418
- Darlene?
- Yes, Pastor?

27:35.660 --> 27:37.031
Where can I get a robe

27:37.829 --> 27:40.130
or a garment to do this baptism?

28:06.258 --> 28:08.759
Erica Jane Wilcox,

28:08.860 --> 28:11.128
I baptize you in the name
of the Father...

28:15.467 --> 28:16.700
...of the Son...

28:19.037 --> 28:20.538
...and of the Holy Ghost.

28:23.675 --> 28:24.808
Amen.

28:27.846 --> 28:29.547
- May I?
- Yes.

28:33.251 --> 28:36.520
Oh, yes.

28:40.258 --> 28:42.159
Welcome to the family of God.

29:15.327 --> 29:16.460
Pastor Greenleaf?

29:18.496 --> 29:19.930
You can call me Grace.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.901
Thanks for coming... and calling.

29:23.001 --> 29:24.134
No problem.

29:24.235 --> 29:25.381
I'm just sorry it took so long

29:25.406 --> 29:27.697
for someone from the
church to get back to you.

29:29.975 --> 29:32.276
- Um...
- Come on in.

29:32.377 --> 29:33.777
Thank you.

29:37.182 --> 29:38.515
Is this where you live?

29:43.989 --> 29:45.656
Good evening. God is good.

29:45.757 --> 29:49.660
All the time!

29:49.761 --> 29:52.763
Bishop asked me
to apologize to all of you

29:52.864 --> 29:54.064
for him not being able to be here,

29:54.165 --> 29:55.599
but also asked me to encourage you

29:55.700 --> 29:56.834
to forge ahead without him.

29:56.935 --> 30:00.170
In that case, a little heads up.

30:00.271 --> 30:01.805
Deacon Sykes.

30:01.906 --> 30:04.174
There are a number of items
on the agenda tonight

30:04.275 --> 30:09.013
that we would need the
bishop here to resolve, so...

30:09.114 --> 30:10.848
Like what?

30:10.949 --> 30:14.952
Well, tardiness in the service.

30:15.641 --> 30:18.055
We're having a real hard time

30:18.156 --> 30:22.126
getting the 8:00 crowd
out of the parking lot

30:22.227 --> 30:23.694
and the 11:00 crowd in.

30:27.365 --> 30:32.538
And why is this something that can't
be resolved without the bishop?

30:32.914 --> 30:35.139
Because his morning announcements

30:35.240 --> 30:38.342
are the biggest cause of the delay.

30:39.702 --> 30:40.945
Okay.

30:41.782 --> 30:44.014
Well, how about we table that?

30:44.115 --> 30:47.818
Is there anything you feel

30:47.919 --> 30:49.871
we could take action on?

30:50.755 --> 30:52.289
I know outreach

30:52.390 --> 30:53.624
has a presentation they'd like to make

30:53.725 --> 30:55.125
about their homeless initiative.

30:55.226 --> 30:57.828
Yes, but I wouldn't feel comfortable

30:57.929 --> 31:00.631
moving forward without the bishop here.

31:00.732 --> 31:01.899
But let me see.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.034
I can read my report

31:04.135 --> 31:06.737
from the Women on the Move
conference in Chicago.

31:06.838 --> 31:08.539
It's quite inspiring.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.350
You know what?

31:11.358 --> 31:14.044
How about you just email
that to the group, Deacon?

31:14.145 --> 31:15.446
Oh, but the women of the church...

31:15.547 --> 31:18.882
We can let outreach
make their presentation

31:18.983 --> 31:20.551
and we can all get home to our families.

31:20.652 --> 31:23.353
- How's that?
- If you think that's best.

31:23.455 --> 31:26.457
- Outreach, you have the floor.
- All right.

31:26.558 --> 31:28.459
Cops used to be heroes.

31:30.795 --> 31:32.730
Now we're like antibodies.

31:33.364 --> 31:34.865
Body gets sick,

31:34.966 --> 31:37.468
body sends in antibodies
to deal with it.

31:37.569 --> 31:39.470
After the sickness is taken care of,

31:39.571 --> 31:42.272
the body expels the
antibodies or destroys them.

31:42.828 --> 31:44.075
You feel expendable.

31:44.556 --> 31:45.577
Apparently, I am.

31:46.128 --> 31:48.580
I mean, the same people
that used to give me

31:48.680 --> 31:50.909
sweet potato pies and poundcakes,

31:51.616 --> 31:54.293
they're all out there all night

31:54.394 --> 31:56.453
in front of my house screaming at me.

31:57.329 --> 31:58.889
So why were you trying
to reach my father?

31:58.990 --> 32:01.091
Did you just want to talk?

32:01.192 --> 32:04.328
No. My lawyer is getting worried

32:04.429 --> 32:07.397
that the DA is going to press charges

32:07.499 --> 32:09.333
just to settle down the protest.

32:10.384 --> 32:12.069
That must be pretty scary.

32:12.170 --> 32:15.072
Yeah.

32:15.173 --> 32:18.716
She wants me to make
like a public apology.

32:19.410 --> 32:21.512
Says it will look good if I
have somebody from my church

32:21.613 --> 32:23.714
standing with me when I make a statement

32:23.815 --> 32:25.048
as my spiritual advisor.

32:27.118 --> 32:29.036
I guess I was wondering if

32:29.762 --> 32:31.955
that's something
he would be willing to do.

32:34.225 --> 32:36.126
Do you want a spiritual advisor

32:36.227 --> 32:38.962
or you just want someone to stand
behind you and act like one?

32:39.813 --> 32:43.233
At this point, whatever works.

32:48.706 --> 32:49.840
What?

32:51.843 --> 32:54.311
I was wondering...

32:54.412 --> 32:56.184
if you'd take a look
at something for me.

33:06.357 --> 33:07.925
Where'd you get this?

33:29.771 --> 33:30.938
What's the matter?

33:32.650 --> 33:35.419
- Nothing.
- Have you changed your mind?

33:35.520 --> 33:37.888
If you have, just tell me now.

33:37.989 --> 33:40.278
No, I haven't changed my mind.

33:40.379 --> 33:44.228
I want to do this.
Look, I want a family.

33:44.936 --> 33:46.664
So, what's the matter?

33:47.232 --> 33:49.967
You want to wait? We've got three days.

33:50.068 --> 33:51.869
No, it's not that.

33:51.970 --> 33:55.138
- It's just...
- What's the problem?

33:58.176 --> 33:59.309
How do we know?

33:59.992 --> 34:01.211
How do we know what?

34:01.312 --> 34:03.714
That this...

34:03.815 --> 34:05.115
that this will be a good thing.

34:05.216 --> 34:08.685
Look, Charity, maybe I'm not perfect.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.422
I'm not perfect either.

34:11.522 --> 34:14.101
I don't think any parent ever was.

34:15.059 --> 34:17.393
But, Kevin, we've got
something going for us

34:17.495 --> 34:20.530
that your parents didn't have,

34:20.632 --> 34:23.766
my parents don't have, something
most couples don't have.

34:24.753 --> 34:25.668
What's that?

34:26.938 --> 34:28.161
We're friends.

34:29.674 --> 34:34.371
We are best friends,

34:35.165 --> 34:36.813
and we're going to do this

34:36.907 --> 34:40.743
better than anybody ever.

34:42.098 --> 34:45.489
I just don't ever want to hurt
somebody that I love so much.

34:47.492 --> 34:48.958
You won't.

34:57.502 --> 34:58.969
That's "x" right there.

34:59.070 --> 35:00.971
What's "x"?

35:01.072 --> 35:03.899
That. That's your answer.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.110
I will never use this.
When does my brain have...

35:18.723 --> 35:21.158
- What's up there?
- Faith's old room.

35:21.259 --> 35:23.827
They moved all the stuff from her
apartment into it yesterday,

35:23.928 --> 35:25.395
all in boxes.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.884
Oh, check this out.

35:33.504 --> 35:34.738
You should put that back.

35:34.839 --> 35:37.774
Maybe in a few days.

35:40.278 --> 35:42.612
- What's "Little Saints"?
- Children's church.

35:42.714 --> 35:44.548
It's like Sunday school.

35:44.649 --> 35:46.817
Aunt Faith used to lead it
before she moved out.

36:06.537 --> 36:07.871
So what do you think?

36:07.972 --> 36:09.940
Is there any way
to reopen a case like this?

36:10.041 --> 36:13.243
Yeah, uh, not really.

36:13.344 --> 36:15.877
I mean, her going back on her
story the way that she did?

36:16.314 --> 36:18.515
She made herself an unreliable witness.

36:21.352 --> 36:24.187
And what if I can prove that the
second statement was coerced?

36:26.024 --> 36:27.657
I'm not a lawyer,

36:27.759 --> 36:30.061
but as my daddy used to say,

36:31.062 --> 36:33.030
that might could work.

37:29.105 --> 37:30.839
- Janice Turner?
- Yes?

37:31.375 --> 37:32.840
I was wondering if I could talk to you

37:32.942 --> 37:34.498
for a few minutes about Danielle.

37:35.111 --> 37:36.779
Why? What do you want?

37:36.879 --> 37:38.105
My name is Grace Greenleaf

37:38.206 --> 37:39.814
and I'm a pastor at Calvary Fellowship.

37:39.915 --> 37:41.980
Go in the house, DeAndre.

37:43.318 --> 37:45.019
We don't go to Calvary no more.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.755
I know, and I know why.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.092
I know what happened to Danielle.

37:50.192 --> 37:53.227
- Who is it, Mom?
- Nobody. Stay in your room.

37:53.328 --> 37:55.096
Nothing happened to Danielle.

37:55.197 --> 37:56.798
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:56.899 --> 37:59.066
Miss Turner, I know that she
gave a statement to the police,

37:59.168 --> 38:01.002
and I know that she changed her story.

38:01.103 --> 38:02.937
Now, if I could just
talk to her about why.

38:03.038 --> 38:05.106
Leave my family alone.

38:16.018 --> 38:18.119
- Noah?
- Yes, ma'am?

38:18.220 --> 38:21.923
Oh, you're just the man I'm looking for.

38:22.024 --> 38:25.259
Do you and Isabel have a venue yet?

38:25.360 --> 38:26.894
For the wedding? No.

38:26.995 --> 38:30.264
Perfect! I want you to
have it at the house.

38:30.365 --> 38:32.500
- Seriously?
- Yes!

38:32.601 --> 38:35.269
Well, you remember Jacob and
Kerissa's wedding, don't you?

38:35.370 --> 38:38.506
All those tents out on the lawn?

38:38.607 --> 38:41.235
We want to do it all just like that.

38:42.110 --> 38:43.678
And don't worry, darling.
We'll pay for it.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.080
I don't know if I can accept. That's...

38:46.181 --> 38:50.051
Noah, your father worked so
hard for us all those years.

38:50.152 --> 38:52.053
Now, you, you're family.

38:52.154 --> 38:54.188
It's only right.

38:54.289 --> 38:57.195
I'm just mad at myself because
I didn't think of it sooner.

38:57.993 --> 39:02.196
Okay. Thank you. I'll tell Isabel.

39:02.297 --> 39:05.066
Oh, I wish I could see
her face when she hears.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.301
You know, she's so lovely.

39:07.402 --> 39:08.536
Yes, she is.

39:08.637 --> 39:11.138
Oh, and, Noah?

39:11.240 --> 39:12.440
Yes, ma'am?

39:14.009 --> 39:18.045
I've always felt that we have a bond

39:18.146 --> 39:21.949
because of our shared
affection for Gigi.

39:24.786 --> 39:27.922
If you get any sense that she's
having a hard time adjusting here

39:28.023 --> 39:31.788
or doing anything, you know,
out of the ordinary,

39:33.395 --> 39:35.731
you be sure to let me know, won't you?

39:38.200 --> 39:40.134
Yes, ma'am. Certainly.

39:40.902 --> 39:42.436
Hmm.

39:54.349 --> 39:56.317
So, when we start getting all upset

39:56.418 --> 40:00.488
at our friends and our parents
for not being perfect,

40:00.589 --> 40:02.590
we're missing the point.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.826
No human being's ever
been perfect since Jesus.

40:05.928 --> 40:09.530
Expecting people
to be perfect is like...

40:09.631 --> 40:12.466
is like expecting a cheeseburger

40:12.567 --> 40:14.240
to taste like an apple.

40:14.870 --> 40:17.138
That's not just crazy.

40:17.246 --> 40:18.995
It's kind of gross, right?

40:19.675 --> 40:21.575
And when you're disappointed in people,

40:21.677 --> 40:24.345
guys, the one you should turn to is God.

40:24.446 --> 40:26.847
Just hanging out with God will show you

40:26.949 --> 40:29.450
how to forgive those imperfect people.

40:30.431 --> 40:33.988
This life that's given us
is not about perfection...

40:36.058 --> 40:37.692
- ...it's about love.
- Hey.

40:37.793 --> 40:39.527
Hey.

40:45.667 --> 40:47.354
What you doing down here?

40:48.003 --> 40:49.470
Nothing.

40:51.473 --> 40:52.702
Better day today?

40:53.475 --> 40:54.742
Mm.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.934
Hello?

41:20.035 --> 41:21.202
Somebody came by here

41:21.303 --> 41:22.770
asking about you and Danielle.

41:22.871 --> 41:24.872
- Police?
- No.

41:24.973 --> 41:26.640
She said she was a Greenleaf.

41:27.385 --> 41:30.776
- Grace Greenleaf?
- Yeah. We had a deal.

41:32.814 --> 41:35.182
- I'll handle it.
- What if she comes back here?

41:35.283 --> 41:36.584
She won't, trust me.

41:38.387 --> 41:39.754
I'll handle her.

41:40.305 --> 41:46.288
