11:12.367 --> 11:14.333
Be right with you now.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.167
Well, we were having trouble
finding anyone local...

11:17.167 --> 11:19.800
so we had to reach out
to our sister ministries...

11:19.800 --> 11:22.267
found him out in Tulsa.

11:22.267 --> 11:25.067
Ought to be arriving any day
now.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.300
I don't know what he looks like.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.767
Pastor Johnson...

11:28.767 --> 11:31.133
well, $500 a week
for doing the Lord's work...

11:31.133 --> 11:33.133
ain't nothing to turn
your nose up at now.

11:33.133 --> 11:37.967
That's right, $500 a week plus
half the weekly coffer.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.667
Sir, can I help you?

11:48.667 --> 11:49.967
Is anyone there?

11:49.967 --> 11:53.233
Oh, hey there!

11:53.233 --> 11:56.633
Are you okay?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.067
I'm fine.

11:58.067 --> 12:00.067
Yes, I'm blind,
but I ain't deaf.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.933
What can I do for you?

12:01.933 --> 12:04.433
Uh... I'm your new preacher!

12:04.433 --> 12:06.100
Yeah, I thought I better
get over here...

12:06.100 --> 12:08.400
and see where I'm tending
my flock.

12:10.267 --> 12:11.667
She ain't much to look at...

12:11.667 --> 12:15.600
but the bed's comfy and,
well... it's free.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.267
Well, like the scripture says,
brethren...

12:18.267 --> 12:21.700
it's easier to fit a free bed
through the eye of a needle...

12:21.700 --> 12:25.067
than it is to get a camel
through the gates of heaven.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.633
And one more thing.

12:27.633 --> 12:30.333
The county called and they
sending over some jailbird...

12:30.333 --> 12:32.067
to work off
his community service.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.533
Ought to be here any day now.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.833
Could be some swindler,
or some chicken-shack gypsy.

12:36.833 --> 12:40.067
If I were you, I'd keep
an eye out on him.

If I'm gonna be the preacher...

12:44.833 --> 12:48.167
then I'm gonna need somebody
else to be the convict.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.567
Fortunately, I got a plan.

13:00.167 --> 13:03.833
Well, my day just got
a lot better!

13:03.833 --> 13:06.067
Why do I feel like I'm making
a deal with the devil?

13:06.067 --> 13:08.100
Look, man, you don't owe me
a thing, okay?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.133
Okay, thank you.

13:11.933 --> 13:14.067
Why are you here?

13:14.067 --> 13:16.100
Your daddy was my best friend.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.967
When he died, I just couldn't
handle it...

13:17.967 --> 13:19.400
so I just up and split.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.300
Then the record hit
and everything...

13:21.300 --> 13:24.867
and I never came back
to check on you.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.900
I just want to say, I'm sorry.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.167
Why are you really here, man?

13:31.167 --> 13:33.467
I need you to go back to that
church I damaged...

13:33.467 --> 13:35.800
and do my community service,
so I don't get found out...

13:35.800 --> 13:38.500

to go back to jail.

You could have skipped
all the other crap.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.067

13:43.067 --> 13:44.400
That's another story, come on.

13:47.567 --> 13:50.633

are in the shed.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.067

13:52.067 --> 13:53.633
I'm not doing any of this stuff.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.333
Yes, you will.

home for the day.

front door and that...

supplies.

Hey, what's the difference
between "Sell By" and "Best By"?

14:29.567 --> 14:34.133
I always felt like "Sell By"
was more of a suggestion?

of go, woo-woo!

the first man I sent a sign to.

one to smash right through it...
