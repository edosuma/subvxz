00:01.710 --> 00:03.836
NARRATOR: Tonight on 
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.836 --> 00:05.379
GRETCHEN:
The Jolly Roger was originally

00:05.379 --> 00:06.464
a Templar symbol.

00:06.464 --> 00:08.717
Some of them became pirates.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.720
MARTY: I am very excited
 to see some sort of chamber

00:11.720 --> 00:13.471
-on the mega-bin area.
-Could it be wood?

00:13.471 --> 00:15.265
I don't think so.
It's pretty dense.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.640
CRAIG: If there's a plate
 covering up something,

00:16.640 --> 00:17.934
that's gonna be huge.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.435
RICK:
 We have this lead artifact.

00:19.435 --> 00:21.562
Can you actually put
a precise location on it?

00:21.562 --> 00:25.024
I think I got some pretty
interesting results for you.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.902
MARTY: It is the most historic
thing that's maybe ever happened

00:27.902 --> 00:29.070
in North America.

00:31.321 --> 00:34.993
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:34.993 --> 00:38.496
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.496 --> 00:41.790
for more than 200 years.

00:41.790 --> 00:44.878
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.878 --> 00:47.546
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.546 --> 00:50.383
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.383 --> 00:54.179
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.179 --> 00:56.722
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.722 --> 01:01.143
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.186 --> 01:04.313
And, according to legend,

01:04.313 --> 01:07.400
one more will have to die

01:07.400 --> 01:11.111
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.784
♪ ♪

01:21.206 --> 01:24.125
(thunder crashing)

01:26.710 --> 01:29.838
NARRATOR: It is the start
 of a new and challenging day

01:29.838 --> 01:31.049
on Oak Island.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.509
Did you order this?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.635
-No, I certainly didn't.
-(laughter)

01:34.635 --> 01:38.264
NARRATOR: But despite battling
 strong winds and heavy rain,

01:38.264 --> 01:41.475
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
and their team

01:41.475 --> 01:44.436
remain determined
to continue progress

01:44.436 --> 01:46.438
on one of their most ambitious

01:46.438 --> 01:49.192
and expensive
search operations ever:

01:49.192 --> 01:52.110
the excavation at Smith's Cove.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.322
-CRAIG: How's it going?
-MIKE: We're experiencing

01:54.322 --> 01:56.323
some pretty hard driving
right now.

01:56.323 --> 01:57.700
-Are you?
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.786
I see those two are
a little bit higher on the end.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.120
MIKE: Yeah, the last one
that we just drove,

02:01.120 --> 02:03.081
the taller one,
down there on the end.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.375
Do you think you hit a boulder
there, or is it just dense?

02:05.375 --> 02:08.127
No, it's really, it's really
dense till, is what it is.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.631
-Mm-hmm.
-It's like it's really,
really densed, densed up.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.259
NARRATOR:
 Using more than 100 sections

02:14.259 --> 02:16.051
of steel sheet piling,

02:16.051 --> 02:19.264
the team from Irving Equipment,
Limited is constructing

02:19.264 --> 02:22.975
a massive 525-foot-long
cofferdam

02:22.975 --> 02:25.853
that will fully seal off
the cove from the ocean,

02:25.853 --> 02:28.105
allowing for it
to be completely drained

02:28.105 --> 02:31.985
and excavated down
to a depth of ten feet.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.905
It is Rick
and Marty Lagina's hope

02:35.905 --> 02:38.074
that by excavating the cove
and carefully examining

02:38.074 --> 02:41.201
the spoils,
they and their partners

02:41.201 --> 02:45.289
will be able to find new,
important clues and artifacts.

02:45.289 --> 02:48.543
Artifacts
such as the medieval lead cross

02:48.543 --> 02:51.587
that Rick and Gary Drayton
found here last year,

02:51.587 --> 02:53.298
that will help them solve

02:53.298 --> 02:56.925
the 223-year-old Oak Island
treasure mystery.

02:56.925 --> 03:00.930
They also hope to be able
to locate and shut off

03:00.930 --> 03:03.974
an ancient flood tunnel system
that feeds seawater

03:03.974 --> 03:06.686
into the Money Pit,
and which many believe

03:06.686 --> 03:09.521
has prevented searchers
from being able to find

03:09.521 --> 03:12.859
and retrieve
the fabled Oak Island treasure.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.861
RICK: As I see the perimeter
 of Smith's Cove

03:15.861 --> 03:17.864
being enclosed, I'm very happy.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.783
I think we have
a very unique opportunity here,

03:20.783 --> 03:23.243
and this structure
will allow us

03:23.243 --> 03:26.914
to once and for all properly
investigate it in its entirety.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.794
What's your goal
for today, then?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.670
Put in more false work,
or just run sheet till you're...

03:33.670 --> 03:36.090
We're gonna concentrate
on the sheeting for now,

03:36.090 --> 03:38.884
and then, tomorrow,
we'll concentrate on more frame

03:38.884 --> 03:41.763
-and then more sheets again.
-Makes sense.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.473
RICK: So, all in all, the only
thing you want to change

03:44.473 --> 03:45.891
for tomorrow is the weather.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.561
-Yes.
-(laughter)

03:48.561 --> 03:50.646
-You need help,
you can give me a call.
-I will.

03:50.646 --> 03:53.191
(laughs)

03:53.191 --> 03:54.817
NARRATOR: As the construction
 of the cofferdam

03:54.817 --> 03:57.027
continues at Smith's Cove,

03:57.027 --> 04:00.865
Rick Lagina and members
of the team

04:00.865 --> 04:02.407
have gathered in the war room

04:02.407 --> 04:04.451
to discuss an exciting
development,

04:04.451 --> 04:06.663
one which they hope
will shed new light

04:06.663 --> 04:10.123
on the origin of their most
incredible find to date:

04:10.123 --> 04:12.752
the mysterious lead cross.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.004
So, guys, everybody
is well aware of the cross.

04:16.004 --> 04:18.507
You know, Gary's smiling
as we speak.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.009
-He's made sure everybody
knows about it.
-Right.

04:21.009 --> 04:23.262
Well, we've got something
for you to look at.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.055
CHRIS:
Yeah, very nice.

04:25.055 --> 04:28.935
NARRATOR: Six weeks ago,
 Rick Lagina and Craig Tester

04:28.935 --> 04:30.478
arranged for the cross
to be tested

04:30.478 --> 04:32.896
at the University
of New Brunswick.

04:32.896 --> 04:36.024
Using a process known
as laser ablation,

04:36.024 --> 04:40.071
a microscopically small portion
of the cross was irradiated

04:40.071 --> 04:42.990
with a laser beam
in an effort to determine

04:42.990 --> 04:45.659
not only the exact
chemical makeup of the cross

04:45.659 --> 04:48.245
but where the lead
may have come from.

04:48.245 --> 04:50.999
The results were astounding.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.211
So the lead cross
is not from North America.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.213
-MARTY: Wow.
-Now, with this evidence,

04:57.213 --> 04:59.673
if you will,
it's not North American lead,

04:59.673 --> 05:03.261
it certainly doesn't eliminate
the possibility that this is,

05:03.261 --> 05:05.805
indeed, a Templar connection.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.391
So, in order to further
the-the testing,

05:09.391 --> 05:12.185
we've reached out
to the German Mining Museum.

05:12.185 --> 05:13.646
Charles, why don't you
call him up?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.230
-Okay.
-And, uh, we'll see

05:15.230 --> 05:16.899
-what he can tell us.
-(Skype ringing)

05:16.899 --> 05:20.778
-RICK: Hello, Tobias.
-Hi, guys. How are you doing?

05:20.778 --> 05:23.156
-Good. How are you?
-NARRATOR: Tobias Skowronek

05:23.156 --> 05:25.867
is a geochemist
at the German Mining Museum

05:25.867 --> 05:28.161
in the city of Bochum.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.038
Established in 1930,

05:30.038 --> 05:33.665
the museum boasts
a preeminent research archive

05:33.665 --> 05:36.168
in the field
of mining archaeology,

05:36.168 --> 05:39.379
and is renowned
for its vast database of metals

05:39.379 --> 05:43.968
and other mineral deposits
throughout the ancient world.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.427
RICK:
We're very grateful

05:45.427 --> 05:47.555
for whatever assistance
you can provide us.

05:47.555 --> 05:51.391
I think you have a basic
understanding of our situation.

05:51.391 --> 05:53.728
-We have this lead artifact.
-Okay, great.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.689
And what we would like
to know is, how can you help us?

05:56.689 --> 06:00.317
We're looking for, perhaps,
ore body signature,

06:00.317 --> 06:03.278
perhaps, uh,
dating of the artifact.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:13.331 --> 06:15.040
RICK:
Can you actually put

06:15.040 --> 06:16.834
a precise location on it,

06:16.834 --> 06:20.088
or is it, like, a regional
definition, if you will?

06:20.088 --> 06:24.300
Uh, that depends, of course,
how good the data is.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.886
If the data is pretty good,
then we can assign this

06:26.886 --> 06:28.387
to a single quarry.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.473
If it's okay,
then it's just, uh...

06:31.473 --> 06:35.269
yeah, some area
like that you say,

06:35.269 --> 06:39.816
it's from England
or from Central Europe,

06:39.816 --> 06:41.608
something like that.

06:41.608 --> 06:44.778
Is there any way
to date the item?

06:44.778 --> 06:47.322
TOBIAS:
Um, if you know

06:47.322 --> 06:50.033
from which quarry
the cross came,

06:50.033 --> 06:53.036
then you can say

06:53.036 --> 06:56.165
when this quarry was in use.

06:56.165 --> 07:00.043
So it all depends
on how good our-our data is.

07:00.043 --> 07:02.295
Yeah. Right, right.

07:02.295 --> 07:04.464
Um, I guess
the next question is,

07:04.464 --> 07:07.134
are you interested in
participating in this project?

07:07.134 --> 07:10.846
Of course.
I'm very much interested in it.

07:10.846 --> 07:12.514
I'm looking forward to this.
Of course.

07:12.514 --> 07:14.475
Well, look,
I-I think on our end,

07:14.475 --> 07:16.560
you know,
we would certainly like

07:16.560 --> 07:18.812
to avail ourselves
of your expertise.

07:18.812 --> 07:21.649
We shall send the data files on,
we will send pictures

07:21.649 --> 07:24.235
of the artifact, and we

07:24.235 --> 07:26.237
very much look forward
to your results.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.947
Yeah, I'm very excited
for the data,

07:27.947 --> 07:29.865
and I hope that I can help you.

07:29.865 --> 07:31.783
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

07:31.783 --> 07:34.161
NARRATOR:
 As Rick Lagina arranges

07:34.161 --> 07:35.704
for the lead cross data

07:35.704 --> 07:38.249
to be sent
to the German Mining Museum...

07:38.249 --> 07:42.170
Craig Tester
and Charles Barkhouse

07:42.170 --> 07:44.963
arrive at the so-called
mega-bin area,

07:44.963 --> 07:49.218
located some 600 feet northeast
of the Money Pit site.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.637
BRENNAN: Now, we don't want
that pipe to slide back there.

07:52.637 --> 07:54.139
NARRATOR:
 It was this same area

07:54.139 --> 07:56.100
where recently conducted
seismic testing

07:56.100 --> 07:59.519
had identified
a large and mysterious void,

07:59.519 --> 08:02.230
and where veteran
treasure hunter Dan Blankenship

08:02.230 --> 08:06.360
believed he had located
a centuries-old latrine pit.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.279
MARTY:
 Dan's latrine hole, to me,

08:09.279 --> 08:11.449
is way more exciting
than anything

08:11.449 --> 08:14.492
that could be potentially imaged
in the Money Pit,

08:14.492 --> 08:16.411
because this is
in an undisturbed area

08:16.411 --> 08:18.038
from a searcher standpoint.

08:18.038 --> 08:20.665
If you're going to dig

08:20.665 --> 08:23.002
a toilet facility
in an underground chamber,

08:23.002 --> 08:26.338
it's because men
are working there.

08:26.338 --> 08:29.175
Dan Blankenship came
to an understanding, or belief,

08:29.175 --> 08:32.010
that there were
tunnels and rooms

08:32.010 --> 08:34.429
associated with that area,

08:34.429 --> 08:38.267
so we believe it's worth
looking into investigating.

08:38.267 --> 08:42.145
NARRATOR: In an effort to locate
a possible underground chamber,

08:42.145 --> 08:45.691
the team is using a process
known as "sonic drilling,"

08:45.691 --> 08:47.943
which employs
powerful vibrations

08:47.943 --> 08:50.278
to create
a high-frequency sound

08:50.278 --> 08:51.614
capable of grinding its way

08:51.614 --> 08:54.033
through layers
of rock and earth.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.244
A coring barrel is then used

08:56.244 --> 08:59.580
to take samples at intervals
of every ten feet.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.999
These core samples
will then be transferred

09:01.999 --> 09:03.500
into plastic sleeves...

09:03.500 --> 09:05.503
-It's just like making sausage.
-Yeah.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.464
...so that they can be scanned
with a metal detector

09:08.464 --> 09:11.801
before being
carefully searched by hand.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.135
So, how deep
are you going on this?

09:14.135 --> 09:15.721
The main target is

09:15.721 --> 09:18.182
around 50 feet, but we'll
probably go to a hundred.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.684
We want to get through the
main targets that Dan's found

09:20.684 --> 09:22.144
in this general area.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.272
NARRATOR:
 After finding evidence

09:24.272 --> 09:27.274
of what he believed to be
an old latrine pit,

09:27.274 --> 09:28.650
Dan Blankenship
and his company,

09:28.650 --> 09:32.572
known as the Triton Alliance,

09:32.572 --> 09:34.572
drilled some
40 exploratory boreholes

09:34.572 --> 09:36.783
in an effort to locate
any underground tunnels

09:36.783 --> 09:39.036
that might connect directly
to the Money Pit.

09:39.036 --> 09:42.498
In addition to finding
pieces of metal wire,

09:42.498 --> 09:45.209
Dan's most astonishing
discovery

09:45.209 --> 09:46.876
came in October of 1973,

09:46.876 --> 09:49.504
when his drill bit struck

09:49.504 --> 09:53.426
an impenetrable metal plate
at a depth of 100 feet.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.802
A metal plate that Dan believed

09:55.802 --> 09:59.139
could be covering
a treasure vault.

09:59.139 --> 10:02.350
Could Craig and the Oak Island
team be close to locating

10:02.350 --> 10:04.519
this same
mysterious obstruction?

10:04.519 --> 10:07.731
And if so,
what is it protecting?

10:07.731 --> 10:10.150
This whole area has got a big
question mark hanging over it.

10:10.150 --> 10:12.445
Maybe we're gonna get
some answers here.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.029
One way or the other,
we should know.

10:14.029 --> 10:15.780
-Right?
-Yep.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.163
NARRATOR:
 As the drilling operation

10:23.163 --> 10:24.831
continues in the mega-bin area,

10:24.831 --> 10:27.168
Rick Lagina
and Dave Blankenship

10:27.168 --> 10:30.004
travel to Smith's Cove,

10:30.004 --> 10:31.672
along with Dave's father,

10:31.672 --> 10:34.508
veteran Oak Island treasure
hunter Dan Blankenship.

10:34.508 --> 10:39.013
So, Dan, I'd just like
to show you the cofferdam.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.556
They made a lot of progress.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.017
-They...
-Backward or forward?

10:43.017 --> 10:44.518
(all laugh)

10:44.518 --> 10:46.019
NARRATOR: They are checking
 on the progress

10:46.019 --> 10:47.855
of the massive steel cofferdam,

10:47.855 --> 10:50.691
which is still
under construction.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.902
My God, you've made

10:52.902 --> 10:55.196
a four-lane highway down here.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.864
RICK:
 Well, when you see the crane,

10:56.864 --> 10:58.657
you'll know why.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.830
Isn't that remarkable, Dan?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.749
Whoa.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.250
NARRATOR:
 Although, at the age of 95,

11:09.250 --> 11:12.087
Dan Blankenship is not able
to participate

11:12.087 --> 11:15.383
in field operations
as much as he'd like,

11:15.383 --> 11:18.385
Rick, Marty, and the other
members of the team

11:18.385 --> 11:20.888
consider him to be
an invaluable resource.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.682
The more than 50 years
he has spent trying to solve

11:24.682 --> 11:28.395
the Oak Island mystery has
made him an expert on what can

11:28.395 --> 11:31.065
and can't be done
on the island.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.402
RICK: These sheet piles,
 we're putting about 27 feet

11:34.402 --> 11:36.570
in the ground so that water

11:36.570 --> 11:38.447
doesn't come underneath it.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.908
It's a big,
large-scale project.

11:41.908 --> 11:43.369
DAN B.:
 No question about it.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.203
Whew.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.750
I'd like to know how much
counterweight he's got in.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.378
Almost 300 tons.

11:54.587 --> 11:56.381
-DAN B.: You're kidding.
-DAVE: Nope.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.634
That's a 300-ton crane.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.719
It weighs as much
as it can pick.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.054
-Wow.
-Yep.

12:05.515 --> 12:08.059
DAN B.:
 I wished at the time

12:08.059 --> 12:12.565
I had put my dam out
another 15, 20 feet.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.275
Well, the U-shaped structure,
we're certainly outside of that.

12:15.275 --> 12:17.485
DAN B.:
 You should have

12:17.485 --> 12:19.447
relatively an easy time.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.576
NARRATOR: In the early 1970s,
 while conducting

12:24.576 --> 12:27.288
his own investigation
of Smith's Cove,

12:27.288 --> 12:30.124
Dan and his partner,
David Tobias,

12:30.124 --> 12:33.586
constructed a 15-foot-wide,
earth-filled cofferdam

12:33.586 --> 12:35.462
surrounding the area.

12:35.462 --> 12:39.091
While searching for evidence
of the stone box drains,

12:39.091 --> 12:41.844
Dan made
an incredible discovery:

12:41.844 --> 12:45.514
a mysterious,
65-foot-long wooden structure

12:45.514 --> 12:48.475
laid out in the shape of a "U."

12:48.475 --> 12:52.645
Unfortunately,
before Dan could fully expose

12:52.645 --> 12:55.941
and examine the possibly
ancient man-made formation,

12:55.941 --> 12:59.486
a series of violent storms
compromised the dam,

12:59.486 --> 13:03.365
bringing the operation
to a bitter halt.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.826
I wish I could have gotten
inside of Dan's brain.

13:06.826 --> 13:09.330
You can see in his eyes

13:09.330 --> 13:10.498
that he's marveling
at the enormity

13:10.498 --> 13:12.541
of the scale of the project,

13:12.541 --> 13:14.876
how much work was being done,

13:14.876 --> 13:16.921
and his mind
had to wander back to,

13:16.921 --> 13:19.173
"If only I had had that.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.966
"If only I could have access
to this.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.009
If only I would have had
the manpower."

13:23.009 --> 13:26.138
I would guess there was a bit
of wistfulness in Dan,

13:26.138 --> 13:28.765
that "if only."

13:28.765 --> 13:31.851
But I think he's looking forward
to what we uncover.

13:31.851 --> 13:34.855
I'll tell you one thing,
they were awful clever.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.524
Yes, they were.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.235
Stymied people for 223 years.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.735
You bet they were clever.

13:40.735 --> 13:44.030
(all laugh)

13:44.030 --> 13:46.783
NARRATOR: As construction
 of the cofferdam

13:46.783 --> 13:48.701
continues at Smith's Cove,

13:48.701 --> 13:51.705
some 200 yards northwest...

13:51.705 --> 13:53.749
CHARLES: We're getting close
to target depth.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.876
...Craig Tester,
Charles Barkhouse,

13:56.876 --> 13:59.754
Gary Drayton,
and geologist Terry Matheson

13:59.754 --> 14:01.798
continue to monitor
the progress

14:01.798 --> 14:05.052
of their drilling operation
at the mega-bin site,

14:05.052 --> 14:09.722
the area where recent seismic
scanning revealed the presence

14:09.722 --> 14:13.394
of a massive
175-foot-long chamber

14:13.394 --> 14:16.730
some 50 feet
beneath the surface.

14:16.730 --> 14:20.400
You know, from seismic, we think
about 50 feet's our target.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.403
-Okay.
-So, you know,
we're at 40, basically,

14:23.403 --> 14:25.447
so we start really looking
really close from here on down

14:25.447 --> 14:27.533
-'cause seismic's
not that perfect.
-Yep.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.908
So let's take a good look.

14:28.908 --> 14:30.661
Hopefully we find something here
very soon.

14:45.592 --> 14:49.096
-So, we're at 48, 53.
-Yeah.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.097
53 to 58.

14:51.097 --> 14:53.475
Put that patient
on the table, please.

14:55.476 --> 14:57.645
I think I'm gonna
have to operate, Craig.

14:57.645 --> 14:59.565
Go for it.

15:07.822 --> 15:11.034
And now, look, that-that's...

15:11.034 --> 15:13.662
that's different.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.538
-It's very dry.
-Yeah.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.168
It's just sandy till.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.629
So, you get these

15:21.629 --> 15:23.630
even within
a major glacial phase,

15:23.630 --> 15:27.467
you'll get a slight period
where there's been some thaw,

15:27.467 --> 15:30.928
and you'll get a sandy stream
running down through

15:30.928 --> 15:34.099
where all the-the fine material
is down the stream.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.226
CRAIG: To me,
from a seismic standpoint,

15:37.226 --> 15:40.105
this may be the anomaly
they were seeing.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.816
It's possible.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.652
NARRATOR:
 Although it is not uncommon

15:44.652 --> 15:46.403
to encounter
a sudden change in soil

15:46.403 --> 15:49.365
from dense layers of clay
to loosely packed sand,

15:49.365 --> 15:52.659
the fact that it occurs
at nearly the same depth

15:52.659 --> 15:55.663
where seismic scanning
detected a large anomaly

15:55.663 --> 15:57.331
is a troubling sign.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.333
Seismic technology

16:00.333 --> 16:02.336
relies on the measurement
of sound waves

16:02.336 --> 16:05.923
to identify abrupt
material changes below ground.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.467
What may appear to be
a potential chamber or void

16:09.467 --> 16:14.014
may actually be little more
than a different type of earth.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.767
We went from a very,
very dense clay

16:16.767 --> 16:20.687
into a soft,
unconsolidated sand,

16:20.687 --> 16:22.940
and I think that's
what the seismic was seeing.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.859
It was reflecting off
when it went from a hard clay

16:25.859 --> 16:27.485
to a softer sand.

16:27.485 --> 16:28.736
TERRY: I don't think
it hurts us too much

16:28.736 --> 16:30.655
to try to go a little deeper.
What do you think?

16:30.655 --> 16:32.658
Yeah, I want to go deeper.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.077
NARRATOR: Although the anomaly
 has proven to not be a void,

16:36.077 --> 16:37.870
the team will now drill deeper

16:37.870 --> 16:39.873
in an effort to find evidence

16:39.873 --> 16:42.793
of the old latrine pit
that Dan Blankenship believes

16:42.793 --> 16:45.379
he discovered
more than 40 years ago.

16:47.088 --> 16:50.591
CRAIG: I'm excited
 to see what's coming yet,

16:50.591 --> 16:52.552
because we're in an area
where historically

16:52.552 --> 16:53.928
there has been some evidence

16:53.928 --> 16:57.557
that man might have been
here underground,

16:57.557 --> 16:59.308
so we've got a target
that we're gonna drill for.

16:59.308 --> 17:01.894
TERRY: What do you think? We're
gonna cut her off at about 100,

17:01.894 --> 17:04.230
-120 or which one?
-Probably 120, yeah.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.647
Yeah, let's see what we got.

17:05.647 --> 17:07.733
Yeah, sounds good.

17:18.327 --> 17:21.498
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
 on Oak Island

17:21.498 --> 17:24.375
and as drilling continues
at the mega-bin area...

17:26.586 --> 17:28.630
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

17:28.630 --> 17:30.423
along with members
of their team,

17:30.423 --> 17:34.595
welcome an important visitor
to the war room.

17:34.595 --> 17:39.266
Gentlemen, today we welcome Judi
to the war room.

17:39.266 --> 17:43.103
And, uh, she comes to us
by way of Zena.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.981
She's worked with Zena on
her research for over ten years,

17:46.981 --> 17:51.111
and she's here to inform us
about some of her research.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.155
NARRATOR: Judi Rudebusch
 is a former colleague

17:54.155 --> 17:56.616
and research partner
of Rick's dear friend,

17:56.616 --> 18:01.329
the late author Zena Halpern,
who recently passed away.

18:01.329 --> 18:06.085
ZENA: These maps are part
of the Templar document.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.002
NARRATOR:
 For the past two years,

18:08.002 --> 18:12.799
Zena was an invaluable resource
to Rick, Marty, and the team.

18:12.799 --> 18:15.969
She provided them not only
with compelling theories

18:15.969 --> 18:18.471
based on her decades
of exhaustive research,

18:18.471 --> 18:20.432
but also a copy

18:20.432 --> 18:23.184
of a 14th century map
of Oak Island,

18:23.184 --> 18:25.186
which she believed
had been made

18:25.186 --> 18:27.815
by members
of the Knights Templar.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.984
Having worked closely with Zena
for more than a decade,

18:31.984 --> 18:35.614
Judi has graciously agreed
to aid Rick and the team

18:35.614 --> 18:37.490
in their study
of Zena's vast collection

18:37.490 --> 18:40.493
of research materials.

18:40.493 --> 18:43.538
RICK: Judi has reached out
and made contact

18:43.538 --> 18:46.165
with an authoress,
Gretchen Cornwall.

18:46.165 --> 18:48.544
She has written a very
insightful book. It's called

18:48.544 --> 18:52.256
The Secret Dossier of a Knight
Templar of the Sangreal.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.509
And in that context,
I will turn it over to Judi.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.802
Well, I first got a hold
of Gretchen

18:57.802 --> 19:01.265
after I had seen some things
that she had written,

19:01.265 --> 19:05.102
and we've been corresponding now
for quite a while.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.645
And the person
that she wrote it with,

19:07.645 --> 19:09.981
John Temple--

19:09.981 --> 19:15.403
John is a direct hereditary
descendant of Templars.

19:15.403 --> 19:19.240
And I think they've got
something interesting to tell us

19:19.240 --> 19:23.662
as far as ancient Templars
coming to America.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.038
So, with that...

19:26.038 --> 19:27.958
RICK: Jack, why don't you
make this connection

19:27.958 --> 19:30.126
to Gretchen and John.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.878
All right.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.299
-Good morning.
-GRETCHEN: Good morning.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.344
I guess it's afternoon there,
actually, isn't it?

19:39.344 --> 19:42.138
-(all chuckle)
-Well, good afternoon then.

19:44.223 --> 19:47.477
NARRATOR: Based in the
 United Kingdom, John Temple,

19:47.477 --> 19:50.396
a member of the modern-day
order of the Knights Templar,

19:50.396 --> 19:52.566
and author Gretchen Cornwall

19:52.566 --> 19:54.817
have worked together
for over a decade

19:54.817 --> 19:57.237
researching the history
of the Templars

19:57.237 --> 19:59.072
and their vast legacy.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.201
In her 2016 book

20:02.201 --> 20:05.996
The Secret Dossier of a Knight
Templar of the Sangreal,

20:05.996 --> 20:10.500
Gretchen presented what she
referred to as a secret record,

20:10.500 --> 20:12.544
which was passed down
through generations

20:12.544 --> 20:14.421
of John Temple's family

20:14.421 --> 20:17.758
and which purports
to document the survival

20:17.758 --> 20:20.551
of the Templar order
following their persecution

20:20.551 --> 20:24.556
and disbandment in France
during the early 14th century.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.309
GRETCHEN:
I was going to

20:28.309 --> 20:31.855
try to give you a... an overview

20:31.855 --> 20:34.398
-of our perspective of history.
-Okay.

20:36.442 --> 20:39.153
The Templars,
when they were outlawed in 1307

20:39.153 --> 20:41.573
to 1312, they were young.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.032
They were healthy.

20:43.032 --> 20:45.786
They had their craft,

20:45.786 --> 20:47.828
their navigation abilities.

20:47.828 --> 20:50.624
They weren't just going to
disappear into a puff of smoke

20:50.624 --> 20:53.876
because a king in France
wanted them to.

20:53.876 --> 20:56.046
Yeah.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.463
No, they took to the seas,

20:57.463 --> 20:59.340
and some went to Scotland.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.175
Some went to Northern England.

21:01.175 --> 21:04.054
They returned to Nova Scotia.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.723
Some of them became pirates...

21:07.723 --> 21:09.558
because they felt
they'd been betrayed.

21:12.311 --> 21:13.563
What's your theory on this?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.817
St. John the Baptist

21:16.817 --> 21:19.778
is the patron saint
of the Templar Knight order.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.490
And, of course,
he was famously beheaded.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.241
Yeah.

21:25.241 --> 21:27.827
GRETCHEN:
And that's how the Jolly Roger

21:27.827 --> 21:31.080
became a pirate symbol.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.290
It's actually originally
a Templar symbol,

21:33.290 --> 21:37.045
and it represents
John the Baptist.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.756
NARRATOR:
 The skull and crossbones,

21:39.756 --> 21:42.634
also known as the Jolly Roger,

21:42.634 --> 21:44.594
a symbol representing
the severed head

21:44.594 --> 21:46.721
of St. John the Baptist.

21:46.721 --> 21:50.683
According to historical
and biblical records,

21:50.683 --> 21:53.854
John the Baptist was a preacher
and prophet

21:53.854 --> 21:56.397
who lived in the ancient
kingdom of Judea

21:56.397 --> 21:58.775
during the first century AD.

21:58.775 --> 22:02.820
Revered as a major religious
figure and Christian saint,

22:02.820 --> 22:06.532
he foretold the coming
of Jesus Christ as a messiah

22:06.532 --> 22:10.578
and famously baptized him in
the waters of the river Jordan.

22:10.578 --> 22:12.538
However,

22:12.538 --> 22:15.416
after publicly condemning
King Herod of Galilee

22:15.416 --> 22:17.376
for unlawfully taking
a second wife,

22:17.376 --> 22:20.005
John the Baptist was imprisoned

22:20.005 --> 22:21.964
and later ordered beheaded

22:21.964 --> 22:25.760
by the king's vengeful wife,
Herodias.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.930
There are many who believe
that the Knights Templar,

22:28.930 --> 22:31.016
while defending
Christian pilgrims

22:31.016 --> 22:35.519
and fighting for control of the
Holy Land during the Crusades,

22:35.519 --> 22:39.775
came into possession of the
skull of St. John the Baptist,

22:39.775 --> 22:43.694
along with a number of other
sacred religious relics.

22:45.780 --> 22:49.076
GRETCHEN: So, the Templars
were highly motivated

22:49.076 --> 22:51.912
to hide something of great worth
that we think

22:51.912 --> 22:54.498
that they discovered
while in the Holy Land.

22:54.498 --> 22:58.960
And it is our thought

22:58.960 --> 23:03.839
that the Money Pit is Templar
in origin.

23:03.839 --> 23:05.384
RICK: Why do you draw
an inference that

23:05.384 --> 23:08.220
there's a Templar connection
to the Money Pit?

23:08.220 --> 23:11.472
GRETCHEN:
Oak Island would be a safe

23:11.472 --> 23:15.894
and a secure hidden place
to put sacred relics.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.355
The Templars were
great engineers.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.856
They would have left

23:20.856 --> 23:24.861
a physical stone key
and marker.

23:24.861 --> 23:28.115
And that's how the Templars
passed down information:

23:28.115 --> 23:31.910
graffiti marks, uh, stone,
buildings, architecture.

23:31.910 --> 23:36.957
So, fast-forward
to the Nolan Cross.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.460
NARRATOR:
 In 1981,

23:40.460 --> 23:44.047
Oak Island treasure hunter
Fred Nolan discovered five

23:44.047 --> 23:46.924
massive cone-shaped boulders
on his property,

23:46.924 --> 23:49.970
which he observed formed a
perfectly symmetrical,

23:49.970 --> 23:52.388
megalithic cross.

23:52.388 --> 23:55.057
Even more astonishing
was the sixth stone

23:55.057 --> 23:57.309
he found buried at the center,

23:57.309 --> 24:01.856
which appeared to be carved in
the likeness of a human skull.

24:01.856 --> 24:06.736
Your headstone, uh, the skull...

24:06.736 --> 24:10.990
The head of the Nolan Cross
is a huge signpost,

24:10.990 --> 24:12.826
if you will, that the Templars
were there.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.494
The Nolan Cross being,
literally,

24:15.494 --> 24:17.497
the skull and crossbones.

24:24.503 --> 24:26.839
GRETCHEN:
 The head of the Nolan Cross

24:26.839 --> 24:29.134
is a huge signpost

24:29.134 --> 24:31.760
that the Templars
were on Oak Island.

24:33.137 --> 24:36.016
NARRATOR:
 In the war room,

24:36.016 --> 24:37.851
author and researcher
Gretchen Cornwall,

24:37.851 --> 24:41.145
along with modern-day Templar
John Temple,

24:41.145 --> 24:42.855
have just presented
Rick, Marty,

24:42.855 --> 24:45.357
and the team
with an incredible theory:

24:45.357 --> 24:48.194
that the megalithic
boulder formation

24:48.194 --> 24:50.697
on Oak Island known
as Nolan's Cross

24:50.697 --> 24:53.325
was created by members
of the Knights Templar

24:53.325 --> 24:56.036
in the 14th century

24:56.036 --> 24:58.538
and that it is meant to signify

24:58.538 --> 25:00.539
that priceless
religious treasures

25:00.539 --> 25:02.709
are buried deep
in the Money Pit.

25:02.709 --> 25:07.547
GRETCHEN: The Nolan Cross is
very precise mathematically

25:07.547 --> 25:09.883
and the key to the Money Pit.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.192
GRETCHEN:
As your measurement.

25:37.451 --> 25:38.744
Which is tithing.

25:38.744 --> 25:40.579
Tithing is the key here.

25:40.579 --> 25:41.998
Ten percent of tithing;

25:41.998 --> 25:43.916
it was always about tithing,
of-of giving.

25:54.426 --> 25:56.721
GRETCHEN: With the Nolan Cross
being, literally, a key,

25:56.721 --> 25:58.390
uh, if you could visualize
picking that-that up,

25:58.390 --> 25:59.932
that structure up,

25:59.932 --> 26:02.394
and putting it right down
into the Money Pit.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.296
NARRATOR: According to John
 and Gretchen's theory,

26:29.296 --> 26:32.464
by overlaying Nolan's Cross
with the original Money Pit,

26:32.464 --> 26:35.301
and then scaling down
its dimensions,

26:35.301 --> 26:38.137
the result would act
as a literal map and key

26:38.137 --> 26:40.557
to the treasure's
precise location,

26:40.557 --> 26:42.474
hidden in a side chamber

26:42.474 --> 26:46.563
some 36 feet away
from the main shaft.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.605
It's not in the Money Pit.

26:48.605 --> 26:51.817
It's off to the side somewhere.

26:51.817 --> 26:55.154
RICK: Well, there's just one
problem, John and-and Gretchen.

26:55.154 --> 26:56.865
Charles,
you want to explain that?

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
Yeah, unfortunately,
we don't know

26:59.159 --> 27:01.036
where that original shaft is.

27:02.578 --> 27:04.288
NARRATOR:
 Since the Money Pit

27:04.288 --> 27:06.665
was first discovered in 1795,

27:06.665 --> 27:09.251
it has been the subject
of numerous

27:09.251 --> 27:12.588
treasure-hunting operations
for more than two centuries.

27:12.588 --> 27:16.009
Because some of these searcher
efforts were so extensive,

27:16.009 --> 27:17.719
and the area so altered,

27:17.719 --> 27:20.888
the exact location
of the original treasure shaft

27:20.888 --> 27:23.682
has been lost over time.

27:23.682 --> 27:27.979
RICK: It's unfortunate that the
opinions that John has rendered

27:27.979 --> 27:31.441
will not facilitate putting "X"
on the ground in the Money Pit.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.986
It's just the Money Pit has no
points of reference any longer.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.529
It's an interesting theory,

27:37.529 --> 27:40.825
but you have to be able to take
a theory into the field,

27:40.825 --> 27:42.993
and, unfortunately,
at this point at least,

27:42.993 --> 27:45.329
uh, we're not able to do that.

27:45.329 --> 27:48.708
What we can do, we can give you
some information

27:48.708 --> 27:51.001
regarding our most current work,

27:51.001 --> 27:53.712
and that might help you
a little bit

27:53.712 --> 27:56.048
as you further
your-your computations.

27:56.048 --> 27:57.133
GRETCHEN:
All right.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.940
RICK:
Well, Gretchen, John,

28:11.940 --> 28:15.902
y-you've certainly given us
a lot to puzzle over,

28:15.902 --> 28:19.071
and we, for our part, all of us
sitting around the table,

28:19.071 --> 28:20.740
uh, thank you very much
for your time,

28:20.740 --> 28:22.241
considerations,
and your knowledge.

28:22.241 --> 28:24.911
ALL:
Thank you.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.453
-Excellent.
-Take care.

28:26.453 --> 28:28.163
-Take care.
-Thanks very much.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.421
NARRATOR:
 Later that day,

28:34.421 --> 28:38.590
Craig Tester and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton,

28:38.590 --> 28:41.301
along with geologist
Terry Matheson,

28:41.301 --> 28:44.931
are continuing their search
of the spoils brought up

28:44.931 --> 28:46.557
from the team's drilling
operation

28:46.557 --> 28:49.227
at the so-called mega-bin site

28:49.227 --> 28:52.896
some 600 feet northeast
of the Money Pit.

29:05.451 --> 29:07.453
NARRATOR:
 It is in this same area

29:07.453 --> 29:10.957
that veteran Oak Island
treasure hunter Dan Blankenship

29:10.957 --> 29:13.460
found compelling evidence
of human activity

29:13.460 --> 29:16.296
some 100 feet deep underground,

29:16.296 --> 29:19.298
including mysterious voids,

29:19.298 --> 29:21.800
wooden tunnels,

29:21.800 --> 29:24.636
and an impenetrable steel plate

29:24.636 --> 29:28.057
believed to be protecting
a possible treasure vault.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.269
BRENNAN:
Yes. We've actually drilled

29:32.269 --> 29:34.439
through a railway track before.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.023
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

29:36.023 --> 29:37.858
What kind of noise does it make
when it goes through?

29:37.858 --> 29:39.652
-Very metallic-y.
-Okay.

29:39.652 --> 29:41.195
-Yeah, there's definitely...
-There's shrieking.

29:41.195 --> 29:43.323
Shrieking, especially as you
core through it,

29:43.323 --> 29:45.325
it, it basically
is like drilling

29:45.325 --> 29:46.992
-without any lubrication.
-Oh, yeah.

29:46.992 --> 29:49.328
So you'll definitely hear
the squeaks.

29:49.328 --> 29:51.580
(grinding)

29:56.794 --> 29:58.755
(grinding)

30:22.737 --> 30:24.029
-Hey, Terry.
-Hello.

30:24.029 --> 30:25.490
Were you expecting
to hit bedrock

30:25.490 --> 30:27.407
or anything like that anytime,
or...?

30:27.407 --> 30:29.661
I would have thought
a little deeper.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.578
Could it be wood or is it...?

30:31.578 --> 30:33.705
I don't think so.
It's pretty... pretty dense.

30:33.705 --> 30:36.166
It could be, uh, Halifax slate.

30:36.166 --> 30:38.294
It could be a-a gray slate.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.380
Uh, it's harder than slate,
whatever I'm on, I think.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.173
Harder than slate?

30:45.009 --> 30:46.635
This could be it.

30:52.224 --> 30:54.394
TERRY:
 This could be it.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.730
NARRATOR: While drilling
 an exploratory borehole

30:57.730 --> 30:59.481
in the mega-bin area,

30:59.481 --> 31:01.901
the Oak Island team
has just encountered

31:01.901 --> 31:03.152
a mysterious obstruction.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.945
-BRENNAN: Teddy!
-MIKE: Yo!

31:04.945 --> 31:06.405
What was your final depth
on that?

31:06.405 --> 31:08.074
99 and a half.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.076
NARRATOR: Could the team
 have found evidence

31:10.076 --> 31:12.202
of the impenetrable
metal object

31:12.202 --> 31:15.582
discovered by Dan Blankenship
at this same depth

31:15.582 --> 31:17.916
back in 1973?

31:17.916 --> 31:19.751
A metal object he believed

31:19.751 --> 31:23.548
to be protecting
an underground treasure vault?

31:27.093 --> 31:28.553
He was torquing on it so much,

31:28.553 --> 31:29.846
-all the joints are locked up.
-Sure, yeah.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.431
Everything's,
everything's solid.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.474
NARRATOR:
 Because the drill is unable

31:34.474 --> 31:36.269
to penetrate the obstruction,

31:36.269 --> 31:38.354
the team will now
examine the core sample,

31:38.354 --> 31:43.026
in the hopes of determining
what it is and possibly

31:43.026 --> 31:44.652
how to get through it.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.278
CRAIG: We don't know
 what's down there.

31:46.278 --> 31:48.280
If there is a plate,
we'll see it,

31:48.280 --> 31:50.282
and if there's a plate
covering up something,

31:50.282 --> 31:51.867
then-then that's gonna be huge.

31:51.867 --> 31:54.244
BRENNAN: Let's see
what you got on this one.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.718
So, we're in, we're in pretty
competent rock, actually.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.472
Yeah, we like to refer
to that as granite.

32:13.472 --> 32:15.557
-Okay.
-We geologists.

32:15.557 --> 32:18.978
That's bedrock.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.564
And, if we're in bedrock,
that's gonna finish this hole.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.817
NARRATOR: Now that the team
 has struck bedrock

32:24.817 --> 32:27.362
at a depth of some 100 feet,

32:27.362 --> 32:29.821
their exploration
of the mega-bin site

32:29.821 --> 32:32.991
has reached
a disappointing end.

32:32.991 --> 32:35.827
Having found no sign
of the massive chamber

32:35.827 --> 32:38.205
indicated
in their seismic survey,

32:38.205 --> 32:40.916
or any evidence
of the underground structures

32:40.916 --> 32:44.170
reported by Dan Blankenship,
they must now decide

32:44.170 --> 32:47.006
whether to conduct
further drilling in the area

32:47.006 --> 32:50.759
or move on to more promising
targets at the Money Pit.

32:50.759 --> 32:52.679
-Gentlemen.
-RICK: Morning, guys.

32:52.679 --> 32:56.598
Didn't find anything
that wasn't geological.

32:56.598 --> 32:58.851
Between 90 and 120, nothing?

32:58.851 --> 33:03.189
Just different clays
and sometimes some boulders,

33:03.189 --> 33:05.692
but in general,
clays almost the entire way.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.611
I think what they saw
on the seismic

33:08.611 --> 33:10.946
is-is this sand interval
right here.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.032
RICK: That's the problem
 with seismic.

33:14.032 --> 33:15.034
It's interpretive.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.618
You know, it's not a photograph.

33:16.618 --> 33:19.872
The data showed densities.

33:19.872 --> 33:23.166
This less dense layer
that was interpreted

33:23.166 --> 33:26.336
as a possible tunnel
and/or a cavern or a void.

33:26.336 --> 33:28.506
Unfortunately it's not so.

33:30.549 --> 33:32.884
Disappointing,
but, you know, now we know.

33:32.884 --> 33:36.263
Every piece of information,
good or bad,

33:36.263 --> 33:38.891
ultimately is good info.

33:38.891 --> 33:40.727
-So, move on, unfortunately.
-CRAIG: Yeah...

33:50.653 --> 33:54.073
NARRATOR:
 Later that evening...

33:54.073 --> 33:56.116
So, Jack, if you can,
uh, ring Tobias up...

33:56.116 --> 33:57.451
Sure.

33:57.451 --> 33:59.912
...brothers Marty
and Rick Lagina

33:59.912 --> 34:02.498
gather with members
of their team in the war room.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.083
RICK:
Hello, Tobias.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.169
Hi, guys.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.420
NARRATOR:
They are eager to hear a report

34:07.420 --> 34:09.422
from German Mining Museum
geochemist

34:09.422 --> 34:12.592
Tobias Skowronek,
concerning the origins

34:12.592 --> 34:16.219
of the lead cross found
last year at Smith's Cove.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.264
So, Tobias, as you can
probably understand,

34:19.264 --> 34:20.766
we're somewhat on pins
and needles

34:20.766 --> 34:23.311
hoping to hear
what you have to tell us.

34:23.311 --> 34:27.315
So, if you you'd be, again,
so kind, uh, we're very anxious.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.777
Yeah, so, I compared
the lead isotope data

34:30.777 --> 34:33.945
of the cross that you gave me
with my database

34:33.945 --> 34:37.324
of ore bodies and metals here,

34:37.324 --> 34:40.494
and I think I got some pretty
interesting results for you.

34:40.494 --> 34:43.539
So, as you already knew,

34:43.539 --> 34:47.376
the lead that was used for the
cross cannot be from America.

34:47.376 --> 34:51.963
Comparing the data,
I noticed that the lead isotopes

34:51.963 --> 34:55.675
of the cross are somehow related
to European deposits.

34:56.885 --> 34:59.304
But I did not find

34:59.304 --> 35:02.641
any match with the quarries
that were used

35:02.641 --> 35:04.851
in the 15th to 17th centuries.

35:04.851 --> 35:09.315
I, therefore, went on
and compared the lead isotopes

35:09.315 --> 35:12.360
of the cross with those
of deposits

35:12.360 --> 35:17.072
where archaeologists know
medieval mining took place,

35:17.072 --> 35:18.990
and I think
I found a match there.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.492
-Really?
-Yeah!

35:20.492 --> 35:23.704
And time period-wise, you think
it's pre-15th century, then?

35:23.704 --> 35:28.000
Um, I think
it's pre-15th century, yes.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.376
-MARTY: Wow.
-You nailed it, Gary.

35:29.376 --> 35:30.836
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

35:30.836 --> 35:32.547
Fantastic.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.757
This could be Templar connected.

35:40.012 --> 35:43.349
TOBIAS: I think
 it's pre-15th century, yes.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.851
MARTY:
Wow.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.018
-Fantastic.
-Unbelievable.

35:47.018 --> 35:49.021
-Sweet.
-(laughter)

35:49.021 --> 35:51.648
NARRATOR: During a meeting
 in Oak Island's war room,

35:51.648 --> 35:54.025
geochemist Tobias Skowronek

35:54.025 --> 35:55.695
has just shared the results

35:55.695 --> 35:58.530
of an astonishing
scientific report.

35:58.530 --> 36:02.284
It suggests that the lead used
to make the cross

36:02.284 --> 36:04.327
found last year at Smith's Cove

36:04.327 --> 36:06.746
was mined
from European deposits

36:06.746 --> 36:09.666
more than 600 years ago.

36:09.666 --> 36:14.213
Pre-15th century,
that's hugely impressive.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.548
How certain about
the time period are you?

36:16.548 --> 36:20.719
It must be earlier, because
from the 15th century onwards,

36:20.719 --> 36:24.556
all the lead came from
very big deposits in Poland

36:24.556 --> 36:27.643
and in Germany, and it's
slightly different from that,

36:27.643 --> 36:31.396
so I think the deposit
from which this lead was mined

36:31.396 --> 36:35.735
is too small to be exploited
on an industrial scale.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.695
MARTY: Wow. Where the heck
did it come from?

36:38.695 --> 36:41.657
The data of the cross
is very consistent

36:41.657 --> 36:44.911
with the area
of Southern France.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.913
Wow.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.873
-Look at him. Look at him.
-(laughter)

36:49.873 --> 36:51.375
Grinning like a Cheshire cat
over there.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.335
GARY:
I knew it.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.128
That's fantastic.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.923
RICK: That cross is associated
 with the Templar-influenced

36:57.923 --> 36:59.342
region in France.

36:59.342 --> 37:04.387
It's certainly the time
of the Templars: 1300s, 1400s,

37:04.387 --> 37:07.516
um, or even earlier.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.561
All of that is astounding news,

37:10.561 --> 37:12.563
but it's not just the one item,

37:12.563 --> 37:14.106
it's what that item represents

37:14.106 --> 37:16.525
and that item
represents possibilities.

37:16.525 --> 37:19.402
What other answers reside
in that cove?

37:19.402 --> 37:24.407
So, Tobias, can you name
a specific city or region?

37:24.407 --> 37:27.702
Most probably the area
of two mountain ranges,

37:27.702 --> 37:31.791
the Cévennes and
the so-called Montagne Noire.

37:33.041 --> 37:36.545
It's, like,
20 miles by 20 miles.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.088
In the area
of Rennes-le-Château?

37:38.088 --> 37:40.132
Yeah. Yeah,
that's pretty close, yeah.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.509
That's exactly where we were.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.887
-Wow. Wow.
-(laughter)

37:44.887 --> 37:47.974
NARRATOR:
 Four years ago,

37:47.974 --> 37:49.474
Marty and Alex Lagina

37:49.474 --> 37:51.559
traveled to Rennes-le-Château--

37:51.559 --> 37:53.896
a village in Southern France--

37:53.896 --> 37:55.981
that has strong connections
to the Knights Templar

37:55.981 --> 37:58.818
dating back
to the 13th century.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.902
My name is Marty.
Nice to meet you.

38:00.902 --> 38:02.737
NARRATOR: There,
 they met with Tobi Dobler,

38:02.737 --> 38:05.992
a modern-day
Templar Grand Master.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.576
MARTY:
 If you were gonna look

38:07.576 --> 38:10.288
for the treasure of the
Knights Templar right now today,

38:10.288 --> 38:11.706
you would look on Oak Island.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.331
That's for sure.

38:13.331 --> 38:14.958
NARRATOR:
 It was Tobi's belief

38:14.958 --> 38:17.210
that members
of the Knights Templar

38:17.210 --> 38:19.338
moved priceless religious
artifacts to Rennes-le-Château

38:19.338 --> 38:22.925
in the 14th century
for safekeeping

38:22.925 --> 38:26.052
before transporting them
to Scotland

38:26.052 --> 38:28.681
and later to Oak Island.

38:28.681 --> 38:32.018
Could the team finally have
the hard scientific evidence

38:32.018 --> 38:33.601
they've been looking for

38:33.601 --> 38:37.398
that the stories of a Templar
journey to Oak Island are true?

38:37.398 --> 38:41.193
And, if so, does that mean
that the many legends

38:41.193 --> 38:43.862
about Templars hiding
a vast treasure on Oak Island

38:43.862 --> 38:45.655
are true as well?

38:45.655 --> 38:47.699
RICK:
 It's stunning information,

38:47.699 --> 38:51.119
but I'm more stunned by the fact
that it has propelled Marty

38:51.119 --> 38:54.498
to really give credence
to the possibilities of

38:54.498 --> 38:59.003
something happened
on this island centuries ago.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.422
It's a piece of data;
I can't disregard data.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.467
Here's a piece that does support
a very ancient landing

39:04.467 --> 39:06.552
on this island at least.

39:06.552 --> 39:10.222
So, it's pre-15th century.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.724
Is there any cutoff going back

39:12.724 --> 39:17.228
where you'd say, "Well, it can't
be older than..." something?

39:17.228 --> 39:21.817
Um, these mines
where the lead came from

39:21.817 --> 39:24.402
were used from the Roman era
onwards.

39:24.402 --> 39:27.030
This is indicated
by pottery shards

39:27.030 --> 39:29.574
that were found there,
so it can be earlier.

39:32.369 --> 39:35.121
RICK: Well, look, Tobias,
all we can do is say thank you.

39:35.121 --> 39:37.666
I think you raised eyebrows
right across the length

39:37.666 --> 39:39.751
and breadth of this table
certainly,

39:39.751 --> 39:43.505
and we'll have to discuss where
we go with the information.

39:43.505 --> 39:46.300
You're very welcome
and I thank you to be involved.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.427
Thank you, Tobias.
Appreciate it.

39:48.427 --> 39:49.594
-MARTY: We'll be in contact.
Thank you.
-Bye.

39:49.594 --> 39:51.222
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.516
Wow.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.682
What do you think, Gary?

39:54.682 --> 39:57.936
I mean, I kind of figured
it was medieval.

39:57.936 --> 40:00.523
-You did.
-That's why I believe that cross

40:00.523 --> 40:04.902
is an historic find
for North America.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.070
And we're overlooking
the big picture.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.697
We haven't finished
in Smith's Cove yet.

40:09.697 --> 40:11.534
-That's right.
-We could find

40:11.534 --> 40:15.913
something even more fantastic
than the cross.

40:15.913 --> 40:19.583
I mean, if it was made
pre-15th century

40:19.583 --> 40:23.795
and it was deposited
near the time it was made,

40:23.795 --> 40:27.215
it is probably the most historic
thing that's maybe ever happened

40:27.215 --> 40:29.510
-in North America.
-Yeah.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.469
DOUG:
That's incredible news.

40:31.469 --> 40:34.556
RICK:
 The hunt continues.

40:34.556 --> 40:38.309
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty,
 and their team,

40:38.309 --> 40:40.896
the exciting news
that the lead in the cross

40:40.896 --> 40:43.356
found at Smith's Cove
can be traced back

40:43.356 --> 40:46.318
more than six centuries
and may also be connected

40:46.318 --> 40:49.320
to the activities of
the Knights Templar in France

40:49.320 --> 40:51.282
offers a welcome validation.

40:51.282 --> 40:55.244
It also suggests
they may be closer than ever

40:55.244 --> 40:59.789
to solving the 223-year-old
Oak Island mystery.

40:59.789 --> 41:02.585
But as they prepare to embark

41:02.585 --> 41:05.086
on their mammoth excavation
of Smith's Cove,

41:05.086 --> 41:08.007
what else will they find?

41:08.007 --> 41:10.592
Evidence of a vast treasure?

41:10.592 --> 41:16.347
Or will they discover something
of evalue?

41:16.347 --> 41:19.684
Perhaps the identities
of those who left it there?

41:19.684 --> 41:23.938
And why, after more than
two centuries of searching,

41:23.938 --> 41:28.027
has the mystery been
so impossible to solve?

41:32.947 --> 41:34.949
Two weeks from tonight,

41:34.949 --> 41:37.577
a special two-hour
Oak Island event.

41:37.577 --> 41:38.954
MARTY:
Whoa-ho-ho!

41:38.954 --> 41:40.748
Not since Moses has the water
been held back so well.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.833
The stars align to the island.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.293
This is a star map.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.460
It's where
the actual treasure is.

41:45.460 --> 41:46.670
This is one of your points.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.380
There's a huge boulder
over here.

41:48.380 --> 41:49.632
It could be a landmark.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.965
Look at that.

41:50.965 --> 41:52.592
CRAIG: Almost all of them
are leaking.

41:52.592 --> 41:53.719
RICK: Well, we're severely
compromised.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.262
We can't function like this.

41:55.262 --> 41:56.847
DOUG: I think
we've got something over here.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.516
Oh, look!
There's something carved there.

41:59.516 --> 42:01.059
-Holy smokes!
-DOUG: I do think

42:01.059 --> 42:02.436
this is the 90 Foot Stone.
