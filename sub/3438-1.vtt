00:51.353 --> 00:53.187
Help me get her in the car, Ray!

00:53.188 --> 00:55.023
Okay, but this bitch

00:55.024 --> 00:56.399
Nigga, get yo' hands off her ass!

00:56.400 --> 00:58.192
Let me finger gangbang
her at least, homie!

00:58.193 --> 01:00.695
- Just help me get it off of her!
- Okay, one finger then!

01:00.696 --> 01:03.698
A'right, but we ain't
goin' inside, homie.

01:03.699 --> 01:05.199
We gonna go around

01:07.202 --> 01:08.703

01:08.704 --> 01:10.538
Why you snuff her
fine ass anyway, homie?

01:10.539 --> 01:11.748
I wanted to bone, Cuz.

01:11.749 --> 01:13.541
- She was possessed, Ray!
- Possessed?

01:13.542 --> 01:16.210
Possessed like head spinnin'
around vomitin' everywhere?

01:16.211 --> 01:19.380
Or like possessed like Kanye
when you take a picture of him?

01:19.381 --> 01:21.549
Just drive like you
got warrants, please!

01:21.550 --> 01:23.384
Nigga, I do got warrants! Look!

01:23.385 --> 01:25.386
These right here! Jaywalkin'!

01:25.387 --> 01:28.222
For eating grapes in the grocery
store without payin' for 'em!

01:28.223 --> 01:30.058
Shavin' my dog's balls in public.

01:30.059 --> 01:32.143
Drivin' with my hands
off the wheel, Cuz.

01:32.144 --> 01:34.729
I be ghost-drivin' my whip, Cuz.
I like doin' that shit, homie.

01:34.730 --> 01:37.648
An altercation with my Moms,
homie, but she provoked me, Cuz!

01:37.649 --> 01:40.026
- Ray-Ray, I think she's waking.
- All right, here! Take this...

01:40.027 --> 01:42.028
and pistol-whip her
with the butt of the gun.

01:42.029 --> 01:43.404
I'm not pistol-whippin'
my girlfriend!

01:43.405 --> 01:46.784
A'right, nigga, well, you drive
and I'll pistol-whip that bitch!

01:47.326 --> 01:50.495
- Kisha, resist!
- But you didn't!

01:50.496 --> 01:53.998
I've seen you for the
bitch that you are, Malcolm.

01:53.999 --> 01:57.168
- What's she talkin' 'bout, homie?
- Booty pirates!

01:57.169 --> 02:00.468
- Nuttin', she's possessed, man.
- S'right, you fucker!

02:00.547 --> 02:03.007
He's a ghost buster!

02:03.008 --> 02:05.259
That sound real suspect
back there, homie.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.594
Was you in juvie, Cuz?

02:06.595 --> 02:09.013
If you don't cry you ain't
no bitch in there, homie.

02:09.014 --> 02:11.766
I didn't cry. Doodles on
they. Joke's on them, Cuz.

02:11.767 --> 02:15.520
By the power vested to me,
that somebody gave me...

02:15.521 --> 02:17.188
while I was locked up...

02:17.189 --> 02:19.482
- Who are you?
- It's Father Williams, homie.

02:19.483 --> 02:21.692
She do a mean impression
of that nigga, Cuz.

02:21.693 --> 02:23.778
I do a mean impression
of The Butler. Check it:

02:23.779 --> 02:26.364
"I'm here for the boss.
I'm here to serve the boss."

02:26.365 --> 02:28.533
- Who are you?
- I'm Forest Whitaker, homie.

02:28.534 --> 02:29.742
From the movie that's
like "The Help" but...

02:29.743 --> 02:31.202
He didn't doo-doo
in the pie, homie.

02:31.203 --> 02:33.704
Ray, I'm not talkin' to you!
I'm talkin' to Kisha. Ray!

02:33.705 --> 02:35.706
Are you gonna let that
bitch choke you out, Cuz?

02:35.707 --> 02:37.174
You a bitch, homie...

02:38.293 --> 02:41.129
- Get the fuck off me!
- Kisha! Kisha!

02:41.130 --> 02:43.131
Shit, she breathed
in my face, homie.

02:43.132 --> 02:44.966
I'll get the bird
ﬂu, it's contagious...

02:44.967 --> 02:46.175
She blacked out, Ray.

02:46.176 --> 02:48.302
Hurry, we don't have much
time! Get us to the hospital.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.303
Hurry!

02:49.304 --> 02:52.057
Ray? Ray?

02:52.307 --> 02:54.104
Oh, shit!

03:02.317 --> 03:03.442
Oh, my God!

03:03.443 --> 03:04.652
Kisha?

03:04.653 --> 03:06.154
Kisha!

03:09.158 --> 03:11.660
Ray? Ray!

03:14.997 --> 03:17.498
It's a good thing I drank
that Hennessy earlier.

03:17.499 --> 03:19.333
I can't feel shit, homie!

03:19.334 --> 03:21.085
- I think Kisha's dead.
- Good!

03:21.086 --> 03:23.133
Let's get the tuck
outta here, homie!

03:23.297 --> 03:26.465
Listen. We were never here.

03:26.466 --> 03:30.011
- I'm with you, Cuz.
- All right. Deuces!

03:30.012 --> 03:32.059
We ghost hunters!

03:41.315 --> 03:43.191
I don't know about
this place, baby.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.318
You've said that about
every house we looked at.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.486
There's just something creepy
about this place, like...

03:47.487 --> 03:49.322
give me the heebie-jeebies...

03:49.323 --> 03:51.073
like somethin' bad
happened in here.

03:51.074 --> 03:53.827
Well, I love it. And I love you.

03:55.204 --> 03:57.163
There you go, bribin'
me with vagina.

03:57.164 --> 03:59.332
- Whatever works.
- Know when I'm weak.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.835
Disgusting.

04:02.211 --> 04:04.003
Oh, it's disgusting
when we do it...

04:04.004 --> 04:05.504
but when you kissing
the whole entire...

04:05.505 --> 04:07.340
sophomore class it's cool, huh?

04:07.341 --> 04:10.009
Gimme that damn
camera, you little gnat!

04:10.010 --> 04:12.511
- Finger. Real creative.
- Cut her some slack.

04:12.512 --> 04:14.096
She's just goin' through a phase.

04:14.097 --> 04:15.681
Yeah, a phase. It's called "whore."

04:15.682 --> 04:18.684
- Look at that. Last a lifetime.
- Malcolm, stop!

04:18.685 --> 04:20.519
No, see, that's a phase.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.064
Looks like he met an
imaginary friend. It's normal.

04:23.065 --> 04:26.192
What you doin' there, buddy?
Wanna help me load some boxes?

04:26.193 --> 04:28.161
- Cool!
- A'right. My man!

04:29.154 --> 04:31.697
- Sorry, Malcolm. I can't.
- Why not?

04:31.698 --> 04:35.451
Tony says, "Aw, hell
no! I ain't yo' slave!"

04:35.452 --> 04:38.621
Is it me or does his
imaginary friend sound black?

04:38.622 --> 04:40.122
Pretty progressive.

04:40.123 --> 04:42.083
Why don't you and
your friend go play?

04:42.084 --> 04:45.087
Okay. That game sounds like fun!

04:47.297 --> 04:49.925
I don't like the
tripping game, Tony.

04:51.969 --> 04:54.136
Look at all that sexy. Come here.

04:54.137 --> 04:57.436
Gimme a kiss. Let's piss
off your forefathers.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.978
Malcolm, it's 2013.

05:01.979 --> 05:04.188
Interracial relationships
are not a big deal anymore.

05:04.189 --> 05:06.274
Yeah, you tell that to the sistas.

05:06.275 --> 05:09.151
You know, they be like,
"Oh, I know he didn't!"

05:09.152 --> 05:12.321
"He did not kiss that
pasty ass white bitch!"

05:12.322 --> 05:12.989
Pasty?

05:12.990 --> 05:15.116
"Yes! Not with them
old thin ass lips.

05:15.117 --> 05:17.618
Look at them, look
like baloney slices!"

05:17.619 --> 05:21.163
"See he spray scrippin' and
it don't make no damn sense."

05:21.164 --> 05:23.499
Come here, Shiloh Junior.
There's my baby boy.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.502
I still can't believe you
named our dog Shiloh Junior.

05:26.503 --> 05:30.172
Well, I was gonna name him
Shiloh ll or Shiloh the Sequel...

05:30.173 --> 05:33.968
but he wouldn't answer to
those, so Shiloh Junior it is.

05:33.969 --> 05:35.970
C'mon! Hey, come on, Shiloh Junior.

05:35.971 --> 05:37.138
Babe, are you gettin' this?

05:37.139 --> 05:39.557
I don't understand your
obsession with cameras.

05:39.558 --> 05:42.143
Hey, you can never have
too many cameras, okay?

05:42.144 --> 05:44.186
Hey, Shiloh! Come on, baby.

05:44.187 --> 05:46.272
You ready to go see your
new house, Shiloh Junior?

05:46.273 --> 05:48.107
Come on, Shiloh
Junior. Shiloh Junior!

05:48.108 --> 05:49.108
Hey, get inside.

05:49.109 --> 05:50.651
Don't make me put
bass in my voice. Hey!

05:50.652 --> 05:51.652
Shiloh!

05:51.653 --> 05:54.030
God, I don't know
what's wrong with him.

05:58.327 --> 05:59.327
Shit! Breathe!

05:59.328 --> 06:01.996
I'm gonna call 9-1-1!

06:01.997 --> 06:04.665
Call 9-1-1. Tell
'em the dog is white!

06:04.666 --> 06:06.167
Tell 'em the dog is white!

06:06.168 --> 06:09.638
Oh, God. I got a pulse.
Breathe! Shiloh, like this...

06:13.175 --> 06:15.803
Fuck! Oh, my back!
Oh my fuckin' back!

06:16.011 --> 06:17.808
Please, help me!

06:21.683 --> 06:24.811
My fuckin' dog is a pancake!

06:26.021 --> 06:27.818
Get me a goddamn pump!

06:33.945 --> 06:35.867
It's working! Come on!

06:42.287 --> 06:44.585
Meet me at the hospital!

06:45.957 --> 06:47.754
The hospital's that way!

06:47.959 --> 06:51.295
So young, never had a
chance to lick his balls.

06:51.296 --> 06:54.173
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm good.

06:54.174 --> 06:56.967
You know, I'm just so happy
I got to spend time with Shi...

06:56.968 --> 07:00.062
It's just every time I try
and say the name Shiii...

07:07.312 --> 07:09.610
Shiloh!

07:11.316 --> 07:14.444
Oh, God, it hurts! Oh, God!

07:14.986 --> 07:18.456
It's tingly in... Oh God!

07:20.659 --> 07:22.535
I'm goin' with you! Oh, God!

07:22.536 --> 07:25.130
Time to go, bye-bye.

07:27.999 --> 07:30.467
Shiloh!

07:36.925 --> 07:38.927
Junior.

07:43.098 --> 07:45.433
You could put a whole lot
of birth control in that.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.101
I really hate you.

07:47.102 --> 07:49.730
That's what your daddy said.
That's why the nigga gone.

07:49.938 --> 07:51.272
What've you got there?

07:51.273 --> 07:53.941
An old box that I
found in the basement.

07:53.942 --> 07:56.110
Don't you think we should
return it to the prior owners?

07:56.111 --> 07:59.071
If they wanted it, they would've
taken it in the first place.

07:59.072 --> 08:02.950
Okay, look, Becky,
I'm not your dad.

08:02.951 --> 08:05.619
I'm just the guy
that's like... your mom.

08:05.620 --> 08:08.414
So I'll make you a deal.
I'll let you keep the box...

08:08.415 --> 08:11.625
if you promise to try and make
this work between me and you, okay?

08:11.626 --> 08:14.754
- It's for your mom.
- Fine.

08:16.965 --> 08:19.133
I think we're gettin' somewhere.

08:19.134 --> 08:22.136
- ¿Qué pasa, mi amigo?
- ¿Qué pasó, hombre?

08:22.137 --> 08:24.638
Aqui nomás, me tiene trabajando
como negro. Está cabrón.

08:24.639 --> 08:26.982
No habla español.

08:29.144 --> 08:31.562
I just do that when I'm talkin'
to negritos. It's all good.

08:31.563 --> 08:33.606
- Did he just call me a nigger?
- What's goin' on, bro?

08:33.607 --> 08:35.441
We just moved in with
my girl right here...

08:35.442 --> 08:38.110
and we was just wonderin' maybe if
you want to add us to your route?

08:38.111 --> 08:40.111
Are you serious? Dude,
I live here, puto!

08:40.113 --> 08:42.615
- It's my house!
- Oh shit! I'm sorry.

08:42.616 --> 08:45.117
I just assumed... you got
the gloves and the hat...

08:45.118 --> 08:47.286
and the lawnmower and the truck.

08:47.287 --> 08:49.622
'Cause I'm Mexican I must be Jose!

08:49.623 --> 08:50.623
Are you?

08:50.624 --> 08:53.125
- No, fool! My name is Miguel!
- Is that your truck?

08:53.126 --> 08:55.628
- Yeah, that's my truck!
- Then who's Jose?

08:55.629 --> 08:57.963
That's my middle name. You
wanna guess my last name?

08:57.964 --> 09:00.007
You guys are here,
you might as well.

09:00.008 --> 09:01.342
I don't know. Rodriguez?

09:01.343 --> 09:03.302
- That's racist, bro.
- You asked...

09:03.303 --> 09:05.971
- Did he ask me or what?
- I'm just fuckin' with you!

09:05.972 --> 09:08.974
For the record, my
name is Miguel Jose...

09:08.975 --> 09:12.061
Jesús González... Smith.

09:12.062 --> 09:15.564
Wait, wait, wait. Your
last name is Smith?

09:15.565 --> 09:18.113
Yeah, I'm Mexican on my mom's side.

09:18.193 --> 09:21.654
So, why is there
González on your truck?

09:21.655 --> 09:24.490
Shit, would you trust your
garden to a guy named Smith?

09:24.491 --> 09:27.368
True. True. Hey, my
name is Malcolm, bro.

09:27.369 --> 09:30.996
- I bet your last name is Johnson.
- See, that's some racist shit!

09:30.997 --> 09:33.545
- Am I right?
- But you're right!

09:33.583 --> 09:36.085
Nice to meet you, man.

09:36.086 --> 09:37.920
Yeah, it's a pleasure meeting you!

09:37.921 --> 09:39.421
I can cut your grass on Tuesdays.

09:39.422 --> 09:42.050
What can I say, I'm a
gardener by ethnic default.

09:42.592 --> 09:45.845
Be good, negrito! Watch out, guera!

09:46.930 --> 09:49.265
What? You gonna try
and tease a brother?

09:49.266 --> 09:51.475
That's a invite? Come
here, let's do the quickie.

09:51.476 --> 09:53.102
One, two, I'm done.

09:53.103 --> 09:56.522
- What's that?
- What? Oh! That's Abigail.

09:56.523 --> 09:59.233
I found her in the
wardrobe that was left here.

09:59.234 --> 10:00.943
Well, put it back. Hey, stop!

10:00.944 --> 10:01.944
She's creepy!

10:01.945 --> 10:04.405
- We look alike.
- Yeah, same eyes and pigtails.

10:04.406 --> 10:06.783
Wait, no, no, don't
put it on the bed!

10:19.963 --> 10:22.636
How you doin'?

10:23.133 --> 10:25.634
Oh, you ain't gonna
say nothin', huh?

10:25.635 --> 10:28.103
So... Girl you stupid.

10:28.638 --> 10:30.973
You don't want none
of this? Come here.

10:30.974 --> 10:33.943
I can't play with it but you can.

10:35.270 --> 10:38.689
Oh, you gonna bite
my lip? Take that!

10:38.690 --> 10:42.401
You fuckin' like this!
It was gonna come.

10:42.402 --> 10:44.495
It was gonna come!

10:46.990 --> 10:49.959
Just wanna put the tip in. I'm
gonna put the tip in a minute...

10:54.331 --> 10:55.957
Look at that.

10:58.293 --> 10:59.501
You got that goody.

10:59.502 --> 11:02.130
Bite the pillow, bite
that fuckin' pillow.

11:05.342 --> 11:08.344
You gonna eat my
butt now. Oh, shit!

11:08.345 --> 11:12.475
Nigga... she... she lickin' that.

11:13.350 --> 11:16.185
Oh, you taste like
doo-doo. But I love it!

11:16.186 --> 11:18.020
You on the pill? I don't
wanna get you pregnant.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.355
You wanna little doll babies?

11:19.356 --> 11:20.689
They gonna have my
eyes or yo' eyes...

11:20.690 --> 11:22.988
You gonna give me splinters!

11:25.195 --> 11:27.948
Fuck this shit, man. I wanna cry!

11:34.329 --> 11:36.497
Don't look. Don't
look. Hold on a second.

11:36.498 --> 11:41.001
This side is wet with
soap, this one is dry.

11:41.002 --> 11:42.503
I'll clean you up, baby.

11:42.504 --> 11:44.004
I mighta leaked in you.

11:44.005 --> 11:46.006
I don't know if I came,
I leaked a little bit.

11:46.007 --> 11:48.676
That's a'right. You
ain't even ovulatin'.

11:48.677 --> 11:51.145
Why you trippin'?
Come on, stop worrying.

11:56.017 --> 11:59.646
- Honey, we're home!
- Shit! You gotta go!

12:00.689 --> 12:02.356
- Shit! No!
- Malcolm!

12:02.357 --> 12:06.360
- Hi, honey!
- Honey, where are you?

12:06.361 --> 12:08.529
You gotta go! We...
I'm just upstairs!

12:08.530 --> 12:10.156
You gotta get outta here.

12:15.370 --> 12:17.371
Fuck!

12:17.372 --> 12:18.839
Shit!

12:28.383 --> 12:30.556
"Hanging Out".

12:31.594 --> 12:35.849
Sounds a little soft for
my taste, but... fuck it.

12:41.312 --> 12:44.110
Yeah, I don't think this is right.

12:44.315 --> 12:46.783
Maybe I should download the manual.

13:22.687 --> 13:26.657
I seen some shit,
but that was crazy!

13:27.192 --> 13:31.028
A demonic figure tried to
hang a family in the backyard.

13:31.029 --> 13:33.280
I gotta keep this from
Megan and the kids.

13:33.281 --> 13:35.282
Is it weird that I
was aroused by this?

13:35.283 --> 13:37.785
Why is my dick bending in my jeans?

13:45.293 --> 13:46.794
Hello?

13:47.462 --> 13:48.462
Hello?

13:48.463 --> 13:52.633
- Twinkle little star...
- Who is this? Hello!

13:52.634 --> 13:54.226
It's the Devil!

14:03.978 --> 14:06.146
That's a ugly motherfucker.

14:06.147 --> 14:08.524
Is that Steven Tyler?

14:11.986 --> 14:14.488
What the hell? Same tree!

14:17.659 --> 14:20.662
Shit! Kisha?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.334
Baby, what you doin'!

14:27.335 --> 14:29.336
I almost dumped the fuck out you!

14:29.337 --> 14:31.004
You got to holler at me!

14:31.005 --> 14:32.506
You can't just be walkin' up.

14:32.507 --> 14:34.967
You gotta give me like
a "whoop-ti-whoo"...

14:34.968 --> 14:36.635
a "kakow!" or a "tsh-tsh"!

14:36.636 --> 14:38.971
Just make your own up.
Please announce yourself!

14:38.972 --> 14:41.850
Honey, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

14:42.141 --> 14:43.350
I think I did.

14:43.351 --> 14:46.645
Wait. So now I look like a ghost.

14:46.646 --> 14:48.146
Excuse me, where
you goin' with this?

14:48.147 --> 14:50.315
So now I'm too pasty for you?

14:50.316 --> 14:52.192
I can't do anything about that!

14:52.193 --> 14:54.653
Unless you want me to get
skin cancer from the sun.

14:54.654 --> 14:56.321
And what, deep nasty wrinkles...

14:56.322 --> 14:57.489
and then they'll have
to give me chemo...

14:57.490 --> 14:59.324
and I'll lose all my hair,
and then I'll look like...

14:59.325 --> 15:01.159
a nasty bald raisin!
Is that what you want?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.452
Is that what you want?

15:02.453 --> 15:04.329
I don't want you to
look like a raisin!

15:04.330 --> 15:06.999
I don't like to date raisins,
I don't like the raisins...

15:07.000 --> 15:08.458
on Morgan Freeman's face!

15:08.459 --> 15:10.711
I don't like the new
ones that Obama got...

15:10.712 --> 15:12.671
the young raisins on his face!

15:12.672 --> 15:17.175
I don't like raisins. So
please, don't look like a raisin.

15:17.176 --> 15:21.931
I need to go meditate and
get my chi back in alignment.

15:22.015 --> 15:23.983
What chi? It was just...

15:35.278 --> 15:38.113
- Walk to the light!
- It's bedtime.

15:38.114 --> 15:40.449
What you all dressed up
for? We goin' to a club?

15:40.450 --> 15:43.285
Formal party? We
goin' to a Pajama Jam?

15:43.286 --> 15:45.078
- Just bed.
- Come on, Megan.

15:45.079 --> 15:47.456
You gotta be more comfortable
with this relationship...

15:47.457 --> 15:48.373
You're right.

15:48.374 --> 15:50.250
Put on some sweat pants and some...

15:50.251 --> 15:54.129
Oh, my Jesus Lord! You're naked!

15:54.130 --> 15:57.132
I am. I like being naked, though.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.134
I could be naked all day.

15:59.135 --> 16:02.471
All day? But come on,
that's not practical, hon.

16:02.472 --> 16:03.722
You got a job.

16:03.723 --> 16:06.975
You don't wanna be on the bus
naked or in Starbucks naked.

16:06.976 --> 16:07.643
Why not?

16:07.644 --> 16:09.645
'Cause that coffee
spill on you, it's hot!

16:09.646 --> 16:11.229
It's gonna leave a scar.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.778
Melt one of your
nipples off or somethin'.

16:13.983 --> 16:16.151
The camera's on, baby.

16:16.152 --> 16:19.747
Good. Just make sure
you film my good side.

16:19.989 --> 16:23.492
What the fuck? Are you serious?

16:23.493 --> 16:25.285
We gonna get all angles on that...

16:25.286 --> 16:26.745
Oh, shit.

16:26.746 --> 16:29.665
Baby, your creepy doll
is makin' my dick scared.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.500
Just let her watch.

16:31.501 --> 16:34.754
You just said the right
type of nasty shit!

16:38.299 --> 16:41.769
Oh, God! I gotta
replenish my ﬂuids.

16:43.972 --> 16:45.940
After round two.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.147
- That was wild.
- Come here, Malcolm.

16:54.148 --> 16:56.867
What, aren't you done yet?

17:00.989 --> 17:03.490
I am now. Ready for round three?

17:03.491 --> 17:04.708
Seriously...

17:08.997 --> 17:11.289
No más. No más. Oh, my God!

17:11.290 --> 17:13.666
Baby, you gotta train
for some shit like this!

17:13.667 --> 17:16.670
Come on, Malcolm, bell's
ringing. Time for round four.

17:16.671 --> 17:19.006
No, no, baby. My ding-ding's
knocked out cold.

17:19.007 --> 17:21.508
I can't do it. Corner's
throwin' in the towel!

17:21.509 --> 17:22.718
Let's go, Malcolm.

17:22.719 --> 17:25.972
I gotta get some Enswell if
we keep goin'! Wait, no, baby!

17:28.348 --> 17:32.479
Right now she is
tearin' me up! My God!

17:34.939 --> 17:37.567
Want me to choke you?
Is that what you like?

17:37.608 --> 17:39.276
Stop being a bitch!

17:39.277 --> 17:42.747
Yeah! Come on! Oh,
you want some of this?

17:43.448 --> 17:45.615
You like that? It's
kinda like a blindfold...

17:45.616 --> 17:47.834
except you can't fuckin' breathe!

17:47.952 --> 17:50.620
- Feel like you're dyin'?
- Thing just moved!

17:50.621 --> 17:52.622
Except you can't fuckin' breathe!

17:52.623 --> 17:54.841
Thing was watching!

17:54.959 --> 17:56.426
You little...

17:56.961 --> 17:58.336
Who was watching?

17:58.337 --> 18:00.589
Oh, baby, come
here. Check this out!

18:01.174 --> 18:03.508
- Oh, my God!
- Did you see it?

18:03.509 --> 18:06.386
- How could I not?
- I thought I was trippin'!

18:06.387 --> 18:08.388
I am so fat! Look at me!

18:08.389 --> 18:10.390
I look like a huge blubber ass!

18:10.391 --> 18:13.226
- I'm like Miss Piggy in there!
- What're you talking about?

18:13.227 --> 18:15.312
You were gonna shoot my good side.

18:15.313 --> 18:18.106
I did shoot your good side.
Look, I got all that ass up in...

18:18.107 --> 18:19.566
Look at all that ass, girl.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.735
I'm black, brothers like an ass.

18:21.736 --> 18:24.785
You know I do mean that
as a compliment, right?

18:24.989 --> 18:26.406
I see what's going on.

18:26.407 --> 18:28.992
You hate my vagina! You
think it's too loose!

18:28.993 --> 18:30.494
It's not! It's only
on the outside...

18:30.495 --> 18:32.579
but once you choose a wall,
it's pretty damn tight.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.456
You know what, Malcolm,
I have had two kids!

18:34.457 --> 18:37.584
I mean, do you think the stork just
dropped 'em off on the doorstep?

18:37.585 --> 18:40.087
No! You're knocked
up for nine months...

18:40.088 --> 18:42.255
and then your lady parts
are stretched to limits...

18:42.256 --> 18:44.925
you cannot even fathom!

18:44.926 --> 18:47.260
Okay, baby. I think
your vagina's cute.

18:47.261 --> 18:50.138
Erase the tape or we are
never having sex again.

18:50.139 --> 18:52.933
- Well, since you put it that way.
- Erase the tape!

18:52.934 --> 18:55.102
- Okay, I'm erasin' the tape!
- I want to see you do it.

18:55.103 --> 18:57.437
- I'm erasing the tape.
- Erase it right now! Do it!

18:57.438 --> 19:00.982
- Baby, I like the way your vagina...
- Erase the tape!

19:00.983 --> 19:03.110
It's not loose! I
like the way it sounds!

19:03.111 --> 19:05.113
Sound like it was
blowin' speakers. It's...

19:05.947 --> 19:08.791
You know, it's kinda
like W. Ferse's bebop!

19:17.667 --> 19:21.128
Who the hell's hittin' me? Abigail?

19:21.129 --> 19:23.131
You got a page?

19:23.297 --> 19:26.133
"In a relationship
with Malcolm Johnson"?

19:26.134 --> 19:29.302
I only hit it once!

19:29.303 --> 19:31.646
What in the hell?

19:32.265 --> 19:34.683
I think I might've
fucked the wrong bitch.

19:34.684 --> 19:37.269
Now she's blowin' up my cell phone?

19:37.270 --> 19:38.436
Look at that.

19:38.437 --> 19:42.908
Straight up stalker! She's crazy!

19:43.609 --> 19:45.986
Listen, it's time to turn
my camera game up a level.

19:45.987 --> 19:49.197
I'm talkin' bathrooms,
countertops, computers...

19:49.198 --> 19:52.033
stuffed animals, mouths and asses!

19:52.034 --> 19:55.754
It's goin' down
everywhere! I'm live.

19:56.289 --> 20:00.544
Kitchen? Oh, yeah, I see you.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.963
Perfect. Yeah, and
I got the ass, too.

20:04.964 --> 20:07.592
All inconspicuous.

20:08.968 --> 20:12.096
Told you, cameras everywhere.

20:12.972 --> 20:14.431
Hey, Becky, wanna
play Hide and Clap?

20:14.432 --> 20:16.104
Fuck off!

20:16.184 --> 20:17.475
That's, "No, thank you."

20:17.476 --> 20:19.978
Let's do this. Ah,
lady's blindfold.

20:19.979 --> 20:22.147
You got this out your
momma's room, right?

20:22.148 --> 20:22.981
Oh, boy.

20:22.982 --> 20:24.983
Things me and your
momma do with this!

20:24.984 --> 20:26.985
Sometimes she tie my
hands and ﬂip me over...

20:26.986 --> 20:29.154
and toss that... salad.

20:29.155 --> 20:31.323
- Tony likes salad.
- Anyway.

20:31.324 --> 20:34.202
I'll put this on. Let's do it!

20:34.243 --> 20:38.580
One, two, three. First clap!

20:38.581 --> 20:42.631
Come on. Come on. Gimme a clap.

20:42.752 --> 20:45.670
Yeah, I'm gettin' close.

20:45.671 --> 20:47.672
I smell you. I smell you.

20:47.673 --> 20:52.010
You smell like kids, like
worms, coins and doo-doo. Like...

20:52.011 --> 20:53.478
Shit!

20:56.349 --> 20:59.309
Can we just play Tag next
time? I just wanna play Tag.

20:59.310 --> 21:02.654
Wyatt? Wyatt?

21:02.688 --> 21:05.156
Where you at, you little shit?

21:11.697 --> 21:13.164
Third clap.

21:19.705 --> 21:22.549
I got you, Wyatt.

21:24.210 --> 21:26.711
I win! You took your blindfold off.

21:26.712 --> 21:29.047
You're right, Tony.
Malcolm is an idiot.

21:29.048 --> 21:31.549
Take your camera, loser.

21:31.550 --> 21:34.929
Yeah, I wanna learn
how to start a fire.

21:36.472 --> 21:39.725
What the... hell was that?

21:40.309 --> 21:42.106
I coulda swore...

21:46.315 --> 21:47.862
Shit!

21:48.317 --> 21:50.444
Fucked you up!

21:52.488 --> 21:56.117
Fuck, are you crazy!
Who the fuck are you!

21:56.158 --> 21:59.035
- Malcolm! Oh my God!
- Baby?

21:59.036 --> 22:01.329
You can't be jumpin' out
on brothers like that.

22:01.330 --> 22:03.331
You'll get knocked the
fuck out every time.

22:03.332 --> 22:05.625
- It was supposed to be a joke!
- You okay?

22:05.626 --> 22:07.335
'Cause I fucked you up!

22:07.336 --> 22:10.005
Like, I hit you with the
force, like with the follow-up.

22:10.006 --> 22:12.215
I wanna ask they
replay that shit. Damn!

22:12.216 --> 22:14.639
'Cause you got
froze. You went, "Oh!"

22:23.019 --> 22:25.021
"Please help me."

22:26.022 --> 22:28.650
God, I hope this works.

22:30.192 --> 22:32.615
What is that thing?

22:34.655 --> 22:36.998
That is not human.

22:49.503 --> 22:51.596
That was weird.

23:05.019 --> 23:06.486
Damn.

23:25.039 --> 23:27.707
- I caught yo' ass!
- No, you didn't.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.505
Bullshit!

23:40.971 --> 23:43.723
Becky...

23:43.724 --> 23:45.975
It's your box.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.185
What?

23:47.186 --> 23:51.611
I want you to touch me.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.035
Okay.

23:59.990 --> 24:02.913
Not that box.

24:08.749 --> 24:10.500
You know I love you
and those kids, right?

24:10.501 --> 24:13.336
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to keep you guys protected.

24:13.337 --> 24:14.463
Yeah.

24:17.007 --> 24:19.475
- What was that?
- What?

24:21.011 --> 24:23.513
- That!
- The wind?

24:23.514 --> 24:27.267
Nigga, the windows
are closed! Okay?

24:27.268 --> 24:29.686
I'm tellin' you, that was
either a ghost or a demon.

24:29.687 --> 24:32.610
Or maybe it was a demon
pregnant with a ghost.

24:33.524 --> 24:35.942
Oh, this is cute!

24:35.943 --> 24:40.573
I'm gonna so wear this,
all day, every day.

24:40.948 --> 24:42.449
What if it's a burglar?

24:42.450 --> 24:44.951
Why the fuck are you
excited? It's a burglar!

24:44.952 --> 24:47.120
Either way it goes,
it's some scary shit!

24:47.121 --> 24:49.080
Okay, not all burglars are scary.

24:49.081 --> 24:52.375
- It is a burglar or a ghost!
- If you talk to him, he'll leave.

24:52.376 --> 24:54.586
- You shoot it in the face!
- You've talked to him already.

24:54.587 --> 24:56.129
If the motherfucker's
foot do this...

24:56.130 --> 24:58.506
- ...you shoot him in the face again!
- That is way too harsh.

24:58.507 --> 24:59.757
What're you gonna do?

24:59.758 --> 25:02.177
- I'll handle it.
- What're you gonna do?

25:02.178 --> 25:03.178
Shoot him.

25:03.179 --> 25:06.432
You are not allowed to shoot
anyone in the face, mister!

25:16.317 --> 25:17.943
Becky?

25:19.111 --> 25:21.529
What in the...? Becky! Oh, God!

25:21.530 --> 25:23.990
Becky! Becky!

25:23.991 --> 25:25.658
Becky! Oh, my God!

25:25.659 --> 25:30.505
- Get me somethin', Megan! Becky!
- Here's the ﬂy swatter!

25:36.962 --> 25:39.964
That's just gross. That
fuckin' sound, it bothers me.

25:39.965 --> 25:41.762
- Use this!
- Gimme!

25:48.974 --> 25:50.942
- Here's what I got!
- Gimme!

25:54.980 --> 25:57.482
Get that thing outta
here! I got an idea!

25:57.483 --> 26:00.735
Come on! Bitch, why
ain't you movin'?

26:00.736 --> 26:02.112
Fuck!

26:02.279 --> 26:04.998
See, now this is a good idea.

26:05.991 --> 26:08.118
A'right. G'night, Becky.

26:09.161 --> 26:10.878
Night, sweetheart.

26:16.168 --> 26:19.087
- Hey, buddy, what you doin'?
- Havin' a tea party.

26:19.088 --> 26:22.423
You wanna go outside and do
somethin' a little more masculine?

26:22.424 --> 26:26.519
- Like play some football?
- No, not really.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.431
Don't sit there!
That's Tony's seat!

26:30.432 --> 26:32.225
Oh, sorry.

26:32.226 --> 26:34.185
My bad, Tony.

26:34.186 --> 26:38.907
Tony says, "No problem,
bee-yotch." Want some tea?

26:39.942 --> 26:41.910
Yeah.... sure.

26:42.278 --> 26:47.579
You know, Wyatt, about
your little buddy Tony...

26:47.950 --> 26:50.285
I don't think he's such
a good influence on you...

26:50.286 --> 26:52.083
know what I mean?

26:54.540 --> 26:59.420
- What the...? That's straight vodka!
- Tony calls it tea.

26:59.962 --> 27:02.422
He drinks a lot of tea.

27:02.423 --> 27:05.300
I really think you guys
need to stop this friendship.

27:05.301 --> 27:07.468
He doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

27:07.469 --> 27:09.554
You know what, you tell Tony...

27:09.555 --> 27:12.265
that I said you and him ain't
gonna be friends no more...

27:12.266 --> 27:14.439
and that's final!

27:16.145 --> 27:19.981
On second thought, you and Tony
have a beautiful friendship.

27:19.982 --> 27:22.191
Okay, I'll be downstairs
doin' somethin'...

27:22.192 --> 27:23.784
With less fuckin' chairs.

27:24.153 --> 27:27.614
This isn't good.
It's happening again.

27:27.615 --> 27:29.913
It's really fuckin' happening.

27:31.327 --> 27:33.079
What the fuck?

27:35.039 --> 27:36.756
Who is it?

27:45.466 --> 27:46.933
Hello?

27:48.969 --> 27:50.937
That's a spooky knock.

27:52.973 --> 27:54.474
Oh, you better run!

27:54.475 --> 27:57.194
Knock on my door, come
out there and slap you...

27:57.728 --> 27:59.445
What the fuck!

27:59.980 --> 28:01.948
I got a knife!

28:13.994 --> 28:16.838
"Miss Me?" Abigail!

28:20.751 --> 28:23.503
Aw, hell no! Look, we gotta talk.

28:23.504 --> 28:26.339
This is a mistake, okay?
This shit gotta stop.

28:26.340 --> 28:27.548
It's gone too far.

28:27.549 --> 28:29.676
You see this? "Miss me"?

28:29.677 --> 28:32.095
In the house with Megan,
are you fuckin' crazy?

28:32.096 --> 28:36.015
I take full responsibility,
all right? This is my bad.

28:36.016 --> 28:39.060
I don't mean to sound
clichéd. It's not you, it's me.

28:39.061 --> 28:42.355
Don't play fuckin' innocent
with me, you knew I had a girl!

28:42.356 --> 28:44.315
I'm just bein' selfish right now.

28:44.316 --> 28:46.275
I would love to have
you and Megan and...

28:46.276 --> 28:48.444
be honest with you,
my stuffed animals.

28:48.445 --> 28:50.405
I'd like to bring them in the mix.

28:50.406 --> 28:53.750
I'm tryin' to make this work.
You're just not makin' it easy.

28:54.201 --> 28:57.420
I swear to... Fuck!

28:59.164 --> 29:02.166
You see what you made me
do? Only you do this to me!

29:02.167 --> 29:03.459
Fuckin' crazy!

29:03.460 --> 29:06.884
Oh, you lucky my momma
told me, don't hit bitches!

29:12.636 --> 29:14.103
Enough.

29:15.973 --> 29:17.640
Fuck, you scare...

29:17.641 --> 29:19.642
I didn't touch you!
I didn't touch you!

29:19.643 --> 29:22.771
You get outta my life, I'll
get outta yours. I'm done.

29:28.986 --> 29:30.612
Make no mistake...

29:30.738 --> 29:34.082
after this, it's over.

29:34.241 --> 29:36.743
You ready to go again? Yeah.

29:42.249 --> 29:45.918
- Hello, Malcolm?
- Professor Wilde. How you doin'?

29:45.919 --> 29:47.628
Malcolm, I'm glad you reached out.

29:47.629 --> 29:49.422
What exactly am I
dealing with here?

29:49.423 --> 29:53.176
Well, the being you
described to me is a demon!

29:53.177 --> 29:54.260
Fuck, I knew it!

29:54.261 --> 29:57.597
A rare and obscure one
from Babylonian times...

29:57.598 --> 30:00.933
named Ahghoul. And
he's a trickster!

30:00.934 --> 30:04.437
And chances are this is not your
first encounter with this demon.

30:04.438 --> 30:07.273
Have you had paranormal
experiences in your past?

30:07.274 --> 30:09.609
Actually, yeah. About a year ago.

30:09.610 --> 30:12.954
This is way worse
than I had thought...

30:14.281 --> 30:17.125
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck!

30:18.619 --> 30:20.620
Nigga, I thought
somebody was shootin'!

30:20.621 --> 30:21.579
Thai food!

30:21.580 --> 30:24.624
It's spicy going in, but
it's twice as spicy going out!

30:24.625 --> 30:26.626
That's scientifically impossible!

30:26.627 --> 30:29.462
I smell you in here!
What in the hell!

30:29.463 --> 30:30.964
Excuse me.

30:34.968 --> 30:38.137
- I hire based on skill level.
- Are those titties?

30:38.138 --> 30:41.182
Ladies, remember, we're
making meth, not baby aspirin.

30:41.183 --> 30:45.144
All the stories revolve
around Ahghoul's attempts...

30:45.145 --> 30:47.980
to trick people into
bringing him into our world...

30:47.981 --> 30:50.316
and it can come in the
form of a possession...

30:50.317 --> 30:52.318
a spirit that only
a child can see...

30:52.319 --> 30:56.322
or an ancient object that
lures in the impressionable.

30:56.323 --> 30:59.325
So what you're saying is something
is coming after me and my family.

30:59.326 --> 31:01.160
Malcolm, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

31:01.161 --> 31:03.162
Damn it, Jessica, you've got
your tit in the pseudophedrine!

31:03.163 --> 31:04.664
Sorry, Malcolm. I
wish you good luck.

31:04.665 --> 31:06.667
Gotta get my "Breaking Bad" on.

31:19.012 --> 31:20.809
Tonight you drown.

31:24.017 --> 31:25.518
Not again.

31:29.690 --> 31:32.192
Sink. Sink. Sink.

31:33.694 --> 31:36.362
Ruined a perfectly
good leather jacket!

31:36.363 --> 31:40.324
That's it. Now we drown. Drown!

31:40.325 --> 31:41.951
Drown!

31:44.997 --> 31:46.669
Prepare to meet Hell.

31:47.291 --> 31:49.213
God, that hurl!

31:52.004 --> 31:54.472
My balls. This isn't over!

31:55.257 --> 32:00.228
Is Ahghoul the same demon
that possessed Kisha?

32:02.097 --> 32:05.016
When are the
Republicans gonna slip...

32:05.017 --> 32:07.685
and call Obama the N-word?

32:07.686 --> 32:10.688
When are they gonna stop
makin' scary movies...

32:10.689 --> 32:12.189
without the Wayans?

32:12.190 --> 32:13.816
They fuckin' suck!

32:22.034 --> 32:23.660
What the hell?

32:43.972 --> 32:46.440
Steroids, bitch!

32:57.986 --> 33:00.784
You messed with the
wrong nigga today!

33:04.785 --> 33:07.662
Baby, put it down!
What are you doing?

33:07.663 --> 33:10.164
I come in the hallway,
fuckin' creepy box...

33:10.165 --> 33:12.166
with somethin' weird
fuckin' alive in it!

33:12.167 --> 33:14.627
And I knew that it
was death in the box!

33:14.628 --> 33:16.128
So I killed it!

33:16.129 --> 33:19.340
- Baby, it was a gift!
- But it ain't Christmas.

33:19.341 --> 33:22.510
- Baby, no.
- Kwanzaa?

33:22.511 --> 33:25.054
You were so upset when
Shiloh Junior died...

33:25.055 --> 33:27.649
that the kids and I
thought we would get you...

33:32.312 --> 33:34.605
- Don't look. Don't look.
- Oh, my God!

33:34.606 --> 33:36.608
Wyatt, go to your room!

33:36.984 --> 33:39.151
I killed a baby.

33:39.152 --> 33:41.487
Oh God, I think
it's still breathing.

33:41.488 --> 33:44.323
- You're so fucking crazy.
- He's still breathing.

33:44.324 --> 33:48.454
I gotta take him out of
misery. I gotta kill him!

33:58.672 --> 34:00.469
Becky?

34:02.384 --> 34:05.637
A'right, let's see
what's in this box now.

34:09.349 --> 34:13.018
God! Wow! That stinks!

34:13.020 --> 34:15.521
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing. Just...

34:15.522 --> 34:18.190
You know your pillows
have blue faces on 'em?

34:18.190 --> 34:20.192
- Stay away from my box!
- Calm down!

34:20.193 --> 34:22.152
- Would you calm down?
- I don't wanna calm down.

34:22.154 --> 34:23.696
I want you to stay
away from my box!

34:23.697 --> 34:25.364
Do you have to say "box" so loud?

34:25.364 --> 34:27.199
What is going on in here?

34:27.199 --> 34:30.703
Nothing. We just
playin'. Dolls 'n stuff.

34:30.704 --> 34:33.956
Malcolm came into my
room and touched my box.

34:33.956 --> 34:37.626
- Malcolm, is this true?
- Yes, but only for like two seconds.

34:37.627 --> 34:40.295
It was stinking!
Like, it was rancid!

34:40.297 --> 34:43.299
Here, smell this. I don't
know how she play with that!

34:43.300 --> 34:46.342
He had two fingers in
my tight little box, Mom.

34:46.344 --> 34:47.386
Stop lyin'.

34:47.387 --> 34:50.389
Baby, there's nothin'
tight about her box.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.476
It's fuckin' huge! I could
put my whole fist in it.

34:53.476 --> 34:56.562
Like, I almost was up to here
for a second. It's crazy big.

34:56.563 --> 34:58.189
You said, "No means no!"

34:58.190 --> 35:00.316
And that is exactly
what I said. I said "No!"

35:00.317 --> 35:03.115
- I did.
- Time the fuck out.

35:03.987 --> 35:07.114
She's trying to Dateline
Special the nigga!

35:07.115 --> 35:09.241
Where's Chris Hansen? Chris! Chris!

35:09.242 --> 35:11.327
Chris, come on, I know
you around here somewhere!

35:11.328 --> 35:13.996
I know he's in here somewhere.
You tryin' to set a nigga up!

35:13.997 --> 35:16.165
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Right now.

35:16.166 --> 35:18.250
There's something really
strange goin' on in this house.

35:18.251 --> 35:20.544
Wyatt? Wyatt, see,
Wyatt used to be my boy.

35:20.545 --> 35:23.339
Like that was my lil' nigga,
like we was like boom-boom!

35:23.340 --> 35:26.342
When my dog died, that
lil' nigga helped me dah!

35:26.343 --> 35:28.344
But lately, he hasn't
even talked to me!

35:28.345 --> 35:29.512
Like, he won't even play with me!

35:29.513 --> 35:32.607
His little imaginary friend,
Tony? I don't think he's really...

35:33.934 --> 35:36.602
- You're crazy, Tony.
- Imagine that.

35:36.603 --> 35:40.106
Did you see that shit?
Look! You missed it!

35:40.107 --> 35:42.608
Okay, look, forget him. Becky.

35:42.609 --> 35:45.277
There's something in that
old box she carries around...

35:45.278 --> 35:46.695
that's making her go crazy!

35:46.696 --> 35:48.447
She sleeps with it,
she eats with it...

35:48.448 --> 35:50.157
she even goes to
the bathroom with it!

35:50.158 --> 35:52.618
Who takes a shit with
a box in their hand?

35:52.619 --> 35:53.953
It's fuckin' weird!

35:53.954 --> 35:57.623
And by "weird' you mean
I'm a terrible mother.

35:57.624 --> 35:58.541
What? No. Wait.

35:58.542 --> 36:00.960
Where did you go? Hold
on a minute. Hold on.

36:00.961 --> 36:03.295
If you were just a
little less judgmental...

36:03.296 --> 36:05.297
she wouldn't feel like she
needs to carry her pain...

36:05.298 --> 36:07.299
- around in a "box"!
- This is not about me!

36:07.300 --> 36:09.218
It is always about you, Malcolm!

36:09.219 --> 36:11.470
"You're too fat, you're
a terrible parent...

36:11.471 --> 36:13.681
you like black guys 'cause
they have bigger cocks!"

36:13.682 --> 36:16.642
That sounds like
you! Do you see this?

36:16.643 --> 36:18.644
That's not fuckin' normal!

36:18.645 --> 36:21.313
Okay, she is just
trying to get attention!

36:21.314 --> 36:23.649
When she was a baby,
she would cry and cry...

36:23.650 --> 36:25.568
and cry all damn day in her crib...

36:25.569 --> 36:27.987
until finally she realized
I wasn't gonna come...

36:27.988 --> 36:29.071
and pick her up!

36:29.072 --> 36:30.739
If you were a parent
you'd know it's called...

36:30.740 --> 36:32.283
the "cry it out method", Malcolm!

36:32.284 --> 36:34.451
Just pick the little bitch up!

36:34.452 --> 36:36.662
She needs to learn somethin', too.

36:36.663 --> 36:38.289
See what I'm saying?

36:38.290 --> 36:43.127
- That is called parenting.
- Wow! Mother of the Year.

36:43.128 --> 36:44.595
Thank you.

36:45.964 --> 36:48.432
That crazy doll keyed my car!

36:49.134 --> 36:51.468
Bro, somebody fucked your car up!

36:51.469 --> 36:53.137
You wouldn't know anybody...

36:53.138 --> 36:54.972
- ...with a auto body shop?
- Are you serious?

36:54.973 --> 36:56.307
Why, contrary to popular belief...

36:56.308 --> 36:58.017
all Mexicans don't have body shops.

36:58.018 --> 36:59.351
What, you think we
all have low riders...

36:59.352 --> 37:00.686
with a bunch of
primer all over it...

37:00.687 --> 37:02.021
with a frickin' Mexican horn?

37:02.022 --> 37:04.315
You think I have like six kids
and all my relatives livin' there?

37:04.316 --> 37:05.691
Probably chase Chihuahuas
and make burritos...

37:05.692 --> 37:06.692
is that what you think?

37:06.693 --> 37:09.320
- Look at the neighborhood, man!
- I didn't think any of that!

37:09.321 --> 37:13.451
- I just want my fuckin' car fixed!
- I'm just fuckin' with you, bro!

37:13.491 --> 37:15.659
You're so easy, man. Oh, shit.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.161
I got a cousin, his
name is Chucho...

37:17.162 --> 37:18.662
he can hook all that
shit up, all right?

37:18.663 --> 37:20.164
Stop fuckin' with
the crazy bitches.

37:20.165 --> 37:21.665
I gotta go, I got the
family waiting. All right?

37:21.666 --> 37:22.333
Be good, man!

37:22.334 --> 37:24.507
Where did she go?

37:26.004 --> 37:28.088
- Take it easy, vato!
- Where you goin'?

37:28.089 --> 37:29.381
Goin' to the swap meet.

37:29.382 --> 37:31.675
We're gonna get some Chihuahuas.

37:31.676 --> 37:33.598
Now that's racist!

37:34.930 --> 37:38.599
So I moved into the house across
the street and I just love it.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.728
The streets are so quiet.
It's perfect for a haunting.

37:43.271 --> 37:46.440
You know, I never got your name.

37:46.441 --> 37:49.610
Kisha? What in the fuck!

37:49.611 --> 37:52.947
- You two know each other?
- Oh! Well, yeah.

37:52.948 --> 37:55.658
You know the boyfriend that
I told you abandoned me...

37:55.659 --> 37:57.911
and left me in a ditch to die?

37:58.203 --> 37:59.750
That's him.

38:01.289 --> 38:04.291
- Awkward!
- Yeah!

38:04.292 --> 38:07.253
I think I'll let
you two have at it.

38:07.254 --> 38:10.464
And thank you so much,
Megan, for the coffee, really.

38:10.465 --> 38:14.139
And, Malcolm, it
was great seeing you.

38:15.470 --> 38:17.096
See you around, Malcolm.

38:19.975 --> 38:21.442
Really?

38:22.143 --> 38:24.645
How come you never
told me about her?

38:24.646 --> 38:28.065
Well, it was just a time in my
life I just wanted to forget.

38:28.066 --> 38:30.484
You need to star': remembering.
She was fucking beautiful!

38:30.485 --> 38:33.445
- She was a'ight.
- "A'ight"?

38:33.446 --> 38:36.282
- I mean, she got nice legs.
- Legs.

38:36.283 --> 38:40.754
- Little ass, but...
- Ass. How 'bout all this?

38:40.954 --> 38:44.623
It's fuckable. Okay? But
that's the... all this...

38:44.624 --> 38:46.041
She's crazy!

38:46.042 --> 38:48.127
She was crazy, baby,
like she was possessed!

38:48.128 --> 38:51.255
- You mean she was possessive.
- No, the bitch was possessed.

38:51.256 --> 38:52.757
- What?
- Yes!

38:52.966 --> 38:55.134
First of all, she
was verbally abusive.

38:55.135 --> 38:56.677
Hey, baby, what's for dinner?

38:56.678 --> 38:59.727
Eat your mothers
pussy you fucking fuck!

39:01.975 --> 39:03.642
It was like she gave up.

39:03.643 --> 39:06.562
Eventually I was able to
drag her to couples' therapy.

39:06.563 --> 39:09.231
Dr. Rousch, me and my girlfriend,
we're kinda goin' through...

39:09.232 --> 39:10.983
a little rough patch.

39:10.984 --> 39:13.152
I mean, she won't
communicate with me.

39:13.153 --> 39:15.621
No matter what I do,
she just sits there.

39:16.990 --> 39:19.158
Okay, and she'll
growl a little bit.

39:19.159 --> 39:20.409
Yes, I can hear that.

39:20.410 --> 39:22.453
And the smallest
things just set her off.

39:22.454 --> 39:24.663
Like crucifixes, or questions.

39:24.664 --> 39:26.632
Is that right, Kisha?

39:30.003 --> 39:32.004
You got a prescription
for "crazy bitch"?

39:32.005 --> 39:34.506
Oh, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.

39:34.507 --> 39:39.558
- It sounds horrible.
- Well, wasn't all bad.

39:39.596 --> 39:43.566
- Wait, I'm come.
- Shut up, you little bitch!

39:45.435 --> 39:47.733
I think you just
knocked out a tooth!

39:49.147 --> 39:52.107
Whose ass is this,
huh? Whose ass is this?

39:52.108 --> 39:53.905
The Devil's!

39:55.945 --> 39:58.614
See, now you just made it weird.

39:58.615 --> 40:01.083
Look at me, goddamnit!

40:04.287 --> 40:07.757
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

40:09.292 --> 40:12.127
Oh baby, you're
makin' my toes do this.

40:12.128 --> 40:13.712
You're makin' my toes do this.

40:13.713 --> 40:15.214
Really, Malcolm?

40:15.215 --> 40:18.093
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

40:18.968 --> 40:21.766
What? Too soon?

40:27.602 --> 40:29.645
There's somethin'
goin' on with this box.

40:29.646 --> 40:31.944
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

40:32.690 --> 40:35.784
What the heck is this
little pervert doin'?

40:37.987 --> 40:40.956
Oh, dude, that is just weird!

40:42.992 --> 40:44.459
Oh, really?

40:46.996 --> 40:50.666
What kind of sweet
tooth fairy is this?

40:50.667 --> 40:53.335
- This nigga need a daddy.
- "Dear Diary.

40:53.336 --> 40:56.004
I lost my virginity to Joey today.

40:56.005 --> 40:58.340
Actually, that's not totally true.

40:58.341 --> 41:01.811
I mean, I've only
had sex with seven...

41:02.011 --> 41:03.345
teen guys...

41:03.346 --> 41:06.474
but only in the butt,
so it doesn't count."

41:08.017 --> 41:10.686
"I mean, I've sucked
a lot of dicks, Diary.

41:10.687 --> 41:12.521
I stopped counting after
the blowjob party...

41:12.522 --> 41:13.605
at Ashley's house.

41:13.606 --> 41:15.691
There must've been
30 or 40 guys there."

41:15.692 --> 41:17.192
She ain't got no bone in her neck.

41:17.193 --> 41:18.527
She got that Plastic Man.

41:18.528 --> 41:22.999
"PS: Diary, I'll never
stop sucking dicks. Ever!"

41:26.369 --> 41:27.661
Would you look there?

41:27.662 --> 41:29.705
A mood ring. So, what mood is that?

41:29.706 --> 41:31.707
It's called: "You're
not my father".

41:31.708 --> 41:33.625
Yeah, that's bitchy
lil' white teenager.

41:33.626 --> 41:36.470
See, that'll get you slapped
in most black neighborhoods.

41:40.633 --> 41:42.430
Are you okay?

41:43.970 --> 41:45.471
Becky?

41:52.312 --> 41:55.481
That is some serious meat-mouth
you got goin' on there.

41:55.482 --> 42:00.829
It's easier going down than it
is coming up. Yeah, it's weird.

42:01.321 --> 42:03.655
Breath smell like sirloin.

42:03.656 --> 42:06.659
I hope that hole
cold ain't contagious.

42:09.662 --> 42:11.789
Professor, it's kinda loud there.

42:11.998 --> 42:14.500
Did I catch you at a bad time?

42:15.335 --> 42:18.670
Endicott? I'm a sativa man.
I got important shit to do!

42:18.671 --> 42:21.340
Hold on! I'm at a party.

42:21.341 --> 42:23.969
I need some of my medicine.

42:27.013 --> 42:30.858
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

42:31.184 --> 42:33.310
Professor! Professor!

42:33.311 --> 42:35.479
Malcolm, that demon's tryin'
to get to you through...

42:35.480 --> 42:37.481
your family and
he's not gonna stop!

42:37.482 --> 42:39.316
You've got the
paranormal equivalent...

42:39.317 --> 42:41.151
of a perfect storm, my friend!

42:41.152 --> 42:42.986
Oh shit! The po-po!

42:42.987 --> 42:44.488
Professor, please! What's goin' on?

42:44.489 --> 42:46.657
I got 12 ounces of crystal
meth jammed up my anus.

42:46.658 --> 42:47.741
I gotta get outta here!

42:47.742 --> 42:49.576
- Police!
- Oh, fuck!

42:49.577 --> 42:51.662
Professor! Professor, please!

42:51.663 --> 42:54.498
- Hands up now!
- I can't go back in!

42:54.499 --> 42:57.923
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

43:00.547 --> 43:04.802
You're under arrest! You
on the screen, freeze!

43:08.346 --> 43:10.013
Hey, knothead!

43:10.014 --> 43:13.517
Oh no, not my favorite
shirt. That bitch.

43:13.518 --> 43:14.940
What the...?

43:16.020 --> 43:19.148
Oh, my God! Are you
fucking kidding me?

43:19.232 --> 43:21.985
No, no, no! Not my clothes! No!

43:27.365 --> 43:30.242
Oh, shit! This crazy wooden bitch!

43:30.243 --> 43:32.119
She's burning my clothes!

43:32.120 --> 43:35.122
Oh, my God! Oh, it's
"Fatal Attraction".

43:35.123 --> 43:38.422
She's gonna boil a rabbit!
She's gonna boil a rabbit!

43:40.128 --> 43:42.296
- Can I get you somethin' to drink?
- Sure, man.

43:42.297 --> 43:43.589
- Tequila?
- Really, bro?

43:43.590 --> 43:45.591
What, you bring the
Mexican into your house and:

43:45.592 --> 43:47.968
"He must want tequila, we
should give him tequila."

43:47.969 --> 43:50.304
"I'm glad he parked his burro
so now I can offer him...

43:50.305 --> 43:51.597
some of his beverage."

43:51.598 --> 43:53.473
I bet you this shit
has a worm in it.

43:53.474 --> 43:55.475
Should've walked in here with
a serape and a sombrero...

43:55.476 --> 43:57.644
for you too, huh? That's what
you wanted really, wasn't it?

43:57.645 --> 44:01.615
You get me all worked up, man!
Look, I could use a drink now.

44:01.649 --> 44:03.984
What kind of tequila
is it? Is it silver?

44:03.985 --> 44:06.320
'Cause I can't drink that
gold shit. That's for cholos.

44:06.321 --> 44:08.780
- Thank you, man.
- We're becomin' friends, right?

44:08.781 --> 44:10.578
Now we are.

44:11.326 --> 44:15.162
- I could trust you with things.
- I mean, I can keep a secret, man.

44:15.163 --> 44:16.455
I'm good at that shit.

44:16.456 --> 44:17.998
The neighbors next door
to me don't even know...

44:17.999 --> 44:19.166
there's a black
guy living here yet.

44:19.167 --> 44:20.884
So, what do you wanna talk about?

44:21.002 --> 44:25.005
Okay, you know the people that
lived in this house before me?

44:25.006 --> 44:27.174
Was there anything
strange goin' on...

44:27.175 --> 44:29.551
like were they actin'
weird or anything?

44:29.552 --> 44:32.271
You saw somethin' a little...

44:32.972 --> 44:36.975
- spooky, or supernatural...?
- I seen some shit.

44:36.976 --> 44:39.102
Come on, man, you don't
believe in that, do you?

44:39.103 --> 44:40.646
'Cause if you did, you
know, you'd have been like...

44:40.647 --> 44:42.648
"Nigger, I'm out!
Not gonna do this."

44:42.649 --> 44:45.150
You mean to tell me you don't
believe in the paranormal?

44:45.151 --> 44:47.653
'Course I believe in that
shit! I'm half Mexican, bro!

44:47.654 --> 44:50.322
I believe in all that shit
people don't believe in.

44:50.323 --> 44:55.661
Freakin' La Llorona, El Cucui,
Chupacabra, Bigfoot, Obamacare.

44:55.662 --> 44:57.329
Interracial dating. Nuclear war.

44:57.330 --> 44:59.998
You name it, I'm all for it.

44:59.999 --> 45:03.335
Me personally, I wouldn't
stay one night in this house.

45:03.336 --> 45:04.503
Oh, shit!

45:04.504 --> 45:06.588
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, bro.

45:06.589 --> 45:09.007
When I first found out that
there was a black guy...

45:09.008 --> 45:10.258
movin' in the neighborhood...

45:10.259 --> 45:13.178
I was like... there goes
the property value...

45:13.179 --> 45:15.180
I'm gonna have to
keep the kids inside...

45:15.181 --> 45:16.348
there's gonna be gangs...

45:16.349 --> 45:19.393
I'm gonna have to cover graffiti,
but you turned out to be okay.

45:19.394 --> 45:20.394
You're really cool!

45:20.395 --> 45:23.689
You're very accommodating.
I think I can help you.

45:23.690 --> 45:24.941
Really.

45:26.150 --> 45:28.360
I need you to cut
the chicken's neck.

45:28.361 --> 45:29.695
Oh, hell fuckin' no!

45:29.696 --> 45:31.363
You wanna get rid
of the demon or not?

45:31.364 --> 45:33.365
I know, but can't we just
go down to the store...

45:33.366 --> 45:35.367
- ...and just like, buy a chicken?
- No, man!

45:35.368 --> 45:37.703
You need a blood sacrifice.

45:37.704 --> 45:40.288
Right. Come here. Let's do it.

45:40.289 --> 45:42.290
Hold on! Hold up, wait a second!

45:42.291 --> 45:44.042
Let me get my shit together.

45:44.043 --> 45:46.545
You gonna shit in my
baby's cereal, chicken?

45:46.546 --> 45:50.926
You wanna piss on my
momma? In her face?

45:53.302 --> 45:55.600
I'll fuck your thing!

45:57.640 --> 46:00.058
Where did you get this
chicken? Your uncle's farm?

46:00.059 --> 46:01.977
No! A cock fighting ring.

46:01.978 --> 46:03.946
You so dead, motherfucka.

46:12.655 --> 46:15.490
Whassup, chicken,
you scared? Whassup?

46:15.491 --> 46:17.959
You don't want none
of this, motherfucker!

46:20.997 --> 46:24.797
Bite him back,
Malcolm! Bite him back!

46:28.171 --> 46:29.337
Drown, bitch!

46:29.338 --> 46:31.465
I'll kill your ass!

46:32.008 --> 46:35.057
Watch what I do to
your fuckin' baby!

46:38.931 --> 46:41.559
What you doin', man? What'd you do?

46:44.187 --> 46:46.564
This pollo is loco!

46:52.278 --> 46:54.613
You got him, Malcolm! That's right!

46:54.614 --> 46:56.991
Yeah, you fucked that chicken.

47:05.625 --> 47:08.126
You gotta go to that
great bucket in the sky!

47:08.127 --> 47:10.629
Tell the Colonel I said hi!

47:14.550 --> 47:15.592
Shit!

47:15.593 --> 47:18.637
That was like an intense-ass
game of Angry Birds, man!

47:18.638 --> 47:21.640
Fuck, bro, you did it! I
think this house is clean!

47:21.641 --> 47:24.476
Well, maybe not clean, but
the demon's gone for sure.

47:24.477 --> 47:27.145
What the hell are we gonna do
with all this chicken, Malcolm?

47:27.146 --> 47:29.648
Oh, yeah, ask the black guy.

47:33.277 --> 47:35.450
Cheers. Right on!

47:39.283 --> 47:42.081
What in the fuck!

47:44.205 --> 47:46.581
You! This is nuts!

47:46.582 --> 47:50.627
You hear me, you googly-eyed
bitch wanton bitch! Come on!

47:50.628 --> 47:55.599
You're making me
bury your fuckin' ass!

48:00.638 --> 48:02.105
Get in there!

48:02.306 --> 48:04.604
Die there, bitch!

48:05.142 --> 48:07.978
B-I-T...

48:07.979 --> 48:10.573
Fuckin' bitch!

48:11.983 --> 48:13.780
You want some of this?

48:16.988 --> 48:20.156
All right, prepare
to meet your maker!

48:20.157 --> 48:24.127
That's right, I'm sending
you back to Taiwan!

48:24.328 --> 48:26.746
You smell like piss and shit!

48:26.747 --> 48:29.716
Come on! You make me sick!

48:32.920 --> 48:35.422
You know what brown can
do for me? Take this!

48:35.423 --> 48:38.392
You sign! Get the fuck outta here!

48:40.928 --> 48:43.430
See, I tried to do it the easy way.

48:43.431 --> 48:45.682
Now you're gonna make me violent.

48:45.683 --> 48:49.062
Come on, you fuck! Shut up!

48:52.607 --> 48:54.941
How you like that, bitch?
I want you to watch.

48:54.942 --> 48:57.035
Let's see you writing now!

48:58.279 --> 49:01.114
Miss me? This is fun.

49:01.115 --> 49:04.084
We about to have a
barbecue. Get in there.

49:04.952 --> 49:06.620
Yeah! Hey, how you doin'?

49:06.621 --> 49:09.590
You gonna fuckin' burn today, baby!

49:11.959 --> 49:15.087
That's what fucking
hell feels like!

49:40.279 --> 49:42.614
You fuckin', fuckin' doll!

49:42.615 --> 49:46.201
I don't want you!
Just die, you little...

49:46.202 --> 49:50.752
I'll fuckin' cut your
goddamn eye out, you bitch!

49:52.458 --> 49:53.925
Malcolm!

49:54.460 --> 49:56.962
- Don't say nothing.
- What did you do to our room?

49:56.963 --> 49:58.630
Honey, it's not what
it looks like, okay?

49:58.631 --> 50:00.548
- Really?
- Listen, listen to me.

50:00.549 --> 50:04.135
This one, she's crazy!
It's not me, she's crazy!

50:04.136 --> 50:06.304
- You're crazy. You're crazy.
- No, honey!

50:06.305 --> 50:08.306
- It's not what it looks like!
- Yeah, right.

50:08.307 --> 50:11.643
I'm not done wit' you,
you fuckin' home-wrecker!

50:11.644 --> 50:13.111
God!

50:14.313 --> 50:16.147
See, nobody will
listen to the black guy!

50:16.148 --> 50:18.733
So everybody dead! I see
how you lookin' at me.

50:18.734 --> 50:21.987
Let me tell you somethin':
This house is haunted.

50:21.988 --> 50:24.656
You know that little doll
that you like so much? Abigail?

50:24.657 --> 50:26.658
Let me tell you
somethin' about Abigail.

50:26.659 --> 50:27.659
She's alive!

50:27.660 --> 50:29.995
That's right, she's alive!

50:29.996 --> 50:33.665
Not like alive, alive, but
alive as in "is possessed."

50:33.666 --> 50:35.083
You know how I know?

50:35.084 --> 50:37.669
'Cause it made me have
sex with it! Repeatedly!

50:37.670 --> 50:41.089
Upstairs, downstairs, in
the kitchen, in the yard!

50:41.090 --> 50:43.133
While you were sleepin' next to us!

50:43.134 --> 50:45.010
Right there where
you're sitting, twice!

50:45.011 --> 50:47.512
And that's why, when you came
upstairs and you caught me...

50:47.513 --> 50:50.223
and I was killing the doll,
because I was just like...

50:50.224 --> 50:52.017
"You're fuckin' up
my relationship!"

50:52.018 --> 50:54.816
And that box? It's cursed!

50:55.021 --> 50:57.022
That box and that box.

50:57.023 --> 50:59.524
That's haunted with a demon.
That box, cursed with dudes.

50:59.525 --> 51:00.525
But that's a whole 'nother story.

51:00.526 --> 51:02.360
And your son, his little
imaginary friend...

51:02.361 --> 51:05.697
that teaches him curse words
and gets him crunk on vodka!

51:05.698 --> 51:08.616
Yeah, yeah, I'm blowing
your spot, little man.

51:08.617 --> 51:11.536
- Well, he's not so imaginary!
- He's cray!

51:11.537 --> 51:14.205
No, no, no. You
cray! You cray-cray!

51:14.206 --> 51:16.583
You and your whole lot
of other ethnic words...

51:16.584 --> 51:19.377
that's goin' out of style.
You ain't funky fresh or dope.

51:19.378 --> 51:21.046
So, how 'bout that, cray-cray?

51:21.047 --> 51:23.174
Mom, he's scaring me.

51:24.050 --> 51:26.718
Is that the nigga
whose room exploded?

51:26.719 --> 51:30.055
I'm scarin' you! Opie,
you somethin' else!

51:30.056 --> 51:31.723
You know what, that's it.

51:31.724 --> 51:34.726
I've had enough of this
whole haunted house craziness!

51:34.727 --> 51:37.228
It's bad enough that
you think it's real...

51:37.229 --> 51:39.314
but now you're scaring the kids!

51:39.315 --> 51:40.648
- I'm scaring the kids!
- Yes!

51:40.649 --> 51:44.486
Ain't that the pot
callin' the kettle a nigga!

51:44.487 --> 51:45.528
No, no, no, baby!

51:45.529 --> 51:48.740
Your kids are scaring me! Okay?

51:48.741 --> 51:50.033
Look at this one!

51:50.034 --> 51:51.493
She's Marilyn Manson in the skin...

51:51.494 --> 51:53.369
and Charlie Manson in the eyes!

51:53.370 --> 51:54.746
Her eyes are crazy, okay?

51:54.747 --> 51:57.165
That's a crazy woman
carryin' around a box...

51:57.166 --> 51:58.541
like fuckin' Lionel
on the Peanuts...

51:58.542 --> 52:01.586
and he's hangin' out with
dead niggas and I'm crazy?

52:01.587 --> 52:03.671
So, what am I supposed
to do with all this?

52:03.672 --> 52:06.299
Maybe you weren't ready!
Maybe we moved in too soon.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.343
Maybe you're not
ready for a family!

52:08.344 --> 52:10.386
But we come as a
package deal, okay?

52:10.387 --> 52:12.639
This ain't about you or them, okay?

52:13.015 --> 52:14.015
Bullshit.

52:14.016 --> 52:16.017
No! Hey! Don't touch that shit!

52:16.018 --> 52:19.270
Don't touch it!
There's a demon ring.

52:19.271 --> 52:21.022
Don't you answer that, you hear?

52:21.023 --> 52:22.774
That's the devil
callin' right there.

52:22.775 --> 52:24.776
That is an evil
ring! You hear that?

52:24.777 --> 52:27.195
Yeah, I said it, a demon ring!

52:27.196 --> 52:30.365
And you can insta tweet
that on your gram-o-vine!

52:30.366 --> 52:31.833
Nobody touch it!

52:32.284 --> 52:35.128
Stop ringing!

52:36.956 --> 52:40.801
Stop ringing! Stop!

52:44.964 --> 52:48.934
- That's a demon callin'.
- Malcolm? Your pocket.

52:53.639 --> 52:55.640
We gotta change my ringer.

52:55.641 --> 52:59.310
Why do we even have
home phones anymore?

52:59.311 --> 53:00.607
I mean...

53:02.148 --> 53:03.982
Yeah? Who is it?

53:03.983 --> 53:05.316
What the hell?

53:05.317 --> 53:08.661
Hey, how you doin',
officer? What's goin' on?

53:09.655 --> 53:12.323
We got a call about
a domestic dispute.

53:12.324 --> 53:13.741
Are you Malcolm Johnson?

53:13.742 --> 53:16.161
Yeah, that's me, but
there's no dispute.

53:16.162 --> 53:17.412
I mean, the phone, but...

53:17.413 --> 53:19.497
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

53:19.498 --> 53:22.208
- Oh, my God!
- Just raised the voice a little bit!

53:22.209 --> 53:24.002
How could I call?
My phone is broken!

53:24.003 --> 53:26.171
I know what... It's
the doll! It's the doll!

53:26.172 --> 53:27.505
It was the doll, brother, listen!

53:27.506 --> 53:30.341
There's this doll, I was
fuckin' this doll, right?

53:30.342 --> 53:32.635
- He's on PCP.
- No, I'm not on PCP!

53:32.636 --> 53:35.305
You fuckin' bitch!
You fuckin' bitch!

53:35.306 --> 53:36.973
You fuckin' bitch!

53:36.974 --> 53:39.101
Malcolm, maybe this
is for the best.

54:20.309 --> 54:23.813
Canister of gas for death.

54:28.025 --> 54:31.495
Now you burn... fire.

55:06.146 --> 55:07.613
What is...

55:09.650 --> 55:11.117
Malcolm?

55:18.492 --> 55:20.118
Malcolm?

55:21.036 --> 55:24.255
Damn, son, you look fucked up!

55:24.331 --> 55:27.500
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!

55:27.501 --> 55:30.670
Mom, your man's in here
pukin' like a little bitch!

55:30.671 --> 55:32.798
See that shit, Tony?

55:36.468 --> 55:38.553
Sometimes the victim
may be tormented...

55:38.554 --> 55:40.305
by more than one demon.

55:40.306 --> 55:42.307
These cases lead to transference.

55:42.308 --> 55:44.475
Trans who? What the
fuck is that, dog?

55:44.476 --> 55:47.312
- Father Williams! Mind your tongue.
- You are a man of the cloth!

55:47.313 --> 55:50.148
Damn man, ain't like I'm
rapin' mu'fuckers no more...

55:50.149 --> 55:51.607
you know what I'm sayin'?

55:51.608 --> 55:54.193
Shit. Keep on wit' your
little lesson, brother.

55:54.194 --> 55:57.196
Victims have also been known
to break their own bones...

55:57.197 --> 55:59.991
- ...during the possession.
- True. That happened to me.

55:59.992 --> 56:03.077
I was first in prison, I was
tryin' to give myself head, right?

56:03.078 --> 56:04.329
'Cause I ain't know nobody.

56:04.330 --> 56:06.622
If I woulda knew somebody,
I wouldn't have had...

56:06.623 --> 56:08.624
to do it to myself. And
it wasn't no, no gay shit.

56:08.625 --> 56:10.501
- First get that out your head.
- That's enough!

56:10.502 --> 56:12.337
I've had enough of your insolence!

56:12.338 --> 56:14.339
My what? My insolence?

56:14.340 --> 56:17.175
Dog, you gonna bring up
my condition right now?

56:17.176 --> 56:20.178
You gonna bring up
my diabetes, dog!

56:20.179 --> 56:21.679
Talkin' 'bout my insolence.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.141
'Cause I like cake?
Yeah, I like cake, guys.

56:25.142 --> 56:27.518
I like cake, birthday
cake, all kinds of cake.

56:27.519 --> 56:29.604
Now come on, cake, cake, cake!

56:29.605 --> 56:33.107
Man, you know what?
I'm sick o' yo' shit!

56:33.108 --> 56:34.442
Get outta here!

56:34.443 --> 56:37.945
Everybody break out.
Get your boy wit' you.

56:37.946 --> 56:40.744
Yeah. I mean really, man.

56:42.451 --> 56:43.618
Wooh. Malcolm?

56:43.619 --> 56:45.286
Hey, Father Williams!

56:45.287 --> 56:47.372
Fuck, nigga, what'd I tell
you about callin' me that?

56:47.373 --> 56:50.291
- I'm sorry. Hey, Doug!
- Roll down, man!

56:50.292 --> 56:52.960
I'm sorry you caught that, man.

56:52.961 --> 56:54.629
I'm so stressed out, man.

56:54.630 --> 56:57.173
I had to shank a mo'fu.
You saw that, right?

56:57.174 --> 57:00.093
- I didn't see nothin'.
- That's a good answer.

57:00.094 --> 57:01.344
That's a good answer.

57:01.345 --> 57:04.013
If you saw it, if you
woulda said yes, I woulda...

57:04.014 --> 57:06.974
That's all right, I
don't have nothin'.

57:06.975 --> 57:08.309
That's the only one I had.

57:08.310 --> 57:10.645
I used to have two shanks,
but I don't keep that anymore.

57:10.646 --> 57:12.063
I stopped doin' two shanks...

57:12.064 --> 57:14.148
'cause it just was a thang,
and ever'body was like:

57:14.149 --> 57:15.149
"Two shanks."

57:15.150 --> 57:17.318
Yeah, so... how you doin'?

57:17.319 --> 57:20.405
I... I need your help.

57:20.406 --> 57:24.242
- It's happenin', Doug.
- Hell no!

57:24.243 --> 57:27.328
I'm not comin' over there
and fuckin' with you...

57:27.329 --> 57:28.996
and your creepy lil' bitch again!

57:28.997 --> 57:30.331
I ain't even with
that bitch no more!

57:30.332 --> 57:32.083
I'm beggin' you, man,
I just need your help.

57:32.084 --> 57:33.292
I just don't know
who else to go to.

57:33.293 --> 57:35.420
Let me explain to you
why I became a priest.

57:35.421 --> 57:37.588
Now, obvious one is
for the little boys.

57:37.589 --> 57:38.423
Yes.

57:38.424 --> 57:42.593
- What're you talkin' about?
- It's a joke, Malcolm!

57:42.594 --> 57:43.678
No, it was a joke.

57:43.679 --> 57:44.512
No, it was a joke.

57:44.513 --> 57:46.514
I did that, you know,
put it on the priests...

57:46.515 --> 57:48.099
and we laugh, that's all.

57:48.100 --> 57:51.936
But I don't know if I can help
you wit' your demon situation...

57:51.937 --> 57:54.439
because I haven't
been stayin' steady...

57:54.440 --> 57:57.650
on my demon fightin' skills,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

57:57.651 --> 58:01.121
Malcolm, day after day...

58:01.947 --> 58:04.157
when you know you can't win...

58:04.158 --> 58:07.618
you're just prolonging
the inevitable!

58:07.619 --> 58:10.621
All you gotta do is let them in.

58:10.622 --> 58:12.540
Are you talkin' about the Devil?

58:12.541 --> 58:15.293
Worse. The Kardashians.

58:15.294 --> 58:20.381
Yeah, it's the crazy mama, it's
Kim, Khloe, Courtney crazy...

58:20.382 --> 58:21.632
the two little ones...

58:21.633 --> 58:24.469
they gonna be freaks. They
got Lamar, they got Scott...

58:24.470 --> 58:24.510
Rob Fat the motherfucker,
Bruce with the acne.

58:24.511 --> 58:27.972
Rob Fat the motherfucker,
Bruce with the acne.

58:27.973 --> 58:30.141
What the fuck is wrong
with Bruce Jenner face?

58:30.142 --> 58:31.517
He look like a monster!

58:31.518 --> 58:34.937
He scares me at night!
And he on in daytime.

58:34.938 --> 58:37.273
He don't look like the nigga
that was on the Wheatie box!

58:37.274 --> 58:38.149
- And Kanye! And Kanye!
- And Julianne Hough!

58:38.150 --> 58:40.276
- And Kanye! And Kanye!
- And Julianne Hough!

58:40.277 --> 58:41.611
I love it and I hate it.

58:41.612 --> 58:44.280
They took Kanye and
they changed him.

58:44.281 --> 58:45.281
Doug, you know...

58:45.282 --> 58:48.117
You have to let go of me, Doug.

58:48.118 --> 58:51.120
- You can't...
- Doug, you gotta let go of me!

58:51.121 --> 58:51.746
There's no place you can
hide. He has a plan for you.

58:51.747 --> 58:55.124
There's no place you can
hide. He has a plan for you.

58:55.125 --> 58:57.168
- Doug, get offa me.
- He will get you!

58:57.169 --> 59:00.593
Doug, get your hands offa me!
What the fuck is wrong wit' you?

59:05.636 --> 59:08.721
Oh, you're the one that got
us out here in the hot heat!

59:08.722 --> 59:11.307
Making me bang all on the
windows with my good church hat!

59:11.308 --> 59:14.310
Hon, I could be at home
watchin' that new Madea movie!

59:14.311 --> 59:15.978
What's the name of
that Madea movie...

59:15.979 --> 59:17.647
with the little girl
from The Fresh Prince?

59:17.648 --> 59:18.981
You know the one, she
played the head of NASA.

59:18.982 --> 59:19.482
You know the one, she
played the head of NASA.

59:19.483 --> 59:20.525
With the aliens!

59:20.526 --> 59:23.653
- "Madea Goes To Mars"!
- "Madea Goes To Mars," that's it!

59:23.654 --> 59:26.989
Hold on, ain't you that
brother that just moved...

59:26.990 --> 59:29.959
into old Burton place?

59:29.993 --> 59:32.245
- Yeah, it's just...
- With a white woman!

59:32.246 --> 59:32.578
Well, she's not all the way white.

59:32.579 --> 59:34.163
Well, she's not all the way white.

59:34.164 --> 59:36.916
She's a white woman
damn near clear!

59:36.917 --> 59:38.918
Come on now, it's 2013.

59:38.919 --> 59:41.337
Interracial relationships
is not a big deal.

59:41.338 --> 59:42.255
What?

59:42.256 --> 59:44.590
You need to tell that
to the lonely sista.

59:44.591 --> 59:46.217
Look at this one
right here. Right here!

59:46.218 --> 59:46.259
Look at this one
right here. Right here!

59:46.260 --> 59:48.261
Honey, show him how you
drop it like it's hot!

59:48.262 --> 59:50.596
Hold up, Bertha, hold up. Hold up.

59:50.597 --> 59:52.265
We ain't got no defibrillator.

59:52.266 --> 59:54.183
You know what it is
with the white girl?

59:54.184 --> 59:56.602
They do that cungalingus,
the finga-ligga-linga.

59:56.603 --> 59:58.563
What is it, the fellatio?

59:58.564 --> 59:59.814
That's what it is, they go deep.

59:59.815 --> 01:00:00.940
That's what it is, they go deep.

01:00:00.941 --> 01:00:04.360
- You know they ain't got no insides.
- I think that's my cue to go.

01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:06.571
'Scuse me, sistas.
Have a good sermon.

01:00:06.572 --> 01:00:11.284
- Where you goin'?
- Let it go! You're angry!

01:00:11.285 --> 01:00:13.411
Brother be trippin',
that's why I got me...

01:00:13.412 --> 01:00:13.494
Brother be trippin',
that's why I got me...

01:00:13.495 --> 01:00:14.954
a white man at home.

01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:17.583
- Yeah, girl.
- Vanilla my ﬂavor.

01:00:20.127 --> 01:00:22.420
- Hello, Malcolm.
- Professor Wilde, thank God.

01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:24.171
I been tryin' to reach you!

01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:26.465
I'm sorry, Malcolm,
I've been a bit tied up.

01:00:26.466 --> 01:00:29.135
I haven't been able to
find any more on Ahghoul...

01:00:29.136 --> 01:00:31.304
though my resources
are a bit limited.

01:00:31.305 --> 01:00:33.973
Professor? Where the hell are you?

01:00:33.974 --> 01:00:36.183
Doin' a stretch of five to ten.

01:00:36.184 --> 01:00:38.978
Apparently the authorities
frown on sellin' meth...

01:00:38.979 --> 01:00:40.646
to college students.

01:00:40.647 --> 01:00:42.315
Yeah, apparently.

01:00:42.316 --> 01:00:44.525
You need to hang up
that computer call...

01:00:44.526 --> 01:00:47.445
come here and kiss
me on my hot mouth.

01:00:47.446 --> 01:00:50.574
I'm feelin' romantical.

01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:53.200
Well, Malcolm, I suppose
I should get going.

01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:55.328
But I will be e-mailing you
the contacts of associates...

01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:56.329
who'll be able to help.

01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:58.122
I don't mean to be
pushy, but any way...

01:00:58.123 --> 01:00:59.582
you could do that
before you get raped?

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:03.669
What part of Mandingo
party do you not understand?

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.631
It's time to power
the white rabbit.

01:01:06.632 --> 01:01:07.465
You know.... dirty the snow.

01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:09.639
You know.... dirty the snow.

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.184
- I'm screwed.
- It's not that bad.

01:01:14.014 --> 01:01:17.063
Lights, please. Thank you.

01:01:18.018 --> 01:01:21.020
So after several exhausting
days of the exorcism...

01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:24.357
I threw some holy water on
her, read an incantation...

01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:27.862
and the demon left
the woman's body.

01:01:28.362 --> 01:01:31.322
I suppose I just
sat back and watched.

01:01:31.323 --> 01:01:34.633
I mean, I'm just the medium
who puts her life in danger...

01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:37.328
Every time she reaches
out to demonic forces.

01:01:37.329 --> 01:01:40.122
But you've got a Bible and
a bottle of holy water...

01:01:40.123 --> 01:01:42.333
so you make the
world a safer place!

01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:44.210
The fact is, people,
is that God is real...

01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:47.635
the Devil is real,
and monsters exist.

01:01:48.006 --> 01:01:51.175
They're vicious,
terrifying entities!

01:01:51.176 --> 01:01:54.011
But the good news is,
Santa Claus doesn't exist...

01:01:54.012 --> 01:01:56.764
so you don't have to worry
about some creepy old guy...

01:01:56.765 --> 01:01:59.350
- ...coming down your chimney.
- What exactly are you guys?

01:01:59.351 --> 01:02:01.185
And who the fuck hired you?

01:02:01.186 --> 01:02:01.936
You can call us Ned and Noreen.

01:02:01.937 --> 01:02:03.688
You can call us Ned and Noreen.

01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:06.273
See? This is why you don't
hire from Craig's List.

01:02:06.274 --> 01:02:07.821
Asshole!

01:02:10.028 --> 01:02:13.364
I don't understand why you
always have to take the credit!

01:02:13.365 --> 01:02:15.533
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover...

01:02:15.534 --> 01:02:16.242
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover...

01:02:16.243 --> 01:02:18.035
and I am the one with a gift!

01:02:18.036 --> 01:02:19.537
It's not my fault that
Ned comes before Noreen...

01:02:19.538 --> 01:02:21.038
in alphabetical order!

01:02:21.039 --> 01:02:23.374
Is that why Ned comes
before Noreen in the bedroom?

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:25.459
Just once I'd like you to do
that thing with your thumb...

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.545
and your forefinger. I think
they call it the "Shocker"?

01:02:27.546 --> 01:02:29.171
Yeah, well, I would like
you to do that thing...

01:02:29.172 --> 01:02:29.630
Yeah, well, I would like
you to do that thing...

01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:31.549
with my balls and the Shocker...

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.634
Hi! Can we help you?

01:02:33.635 --> 01:02:36.971
Yes. There's something
horrible happening in my house.

01:02:36.972 --> 01:02:39.140
My family doesn't realize
what's going on, but I do!

01:02:39.141 --> 01:02:41.642
I'm sure that there's
a rational explanation...

01:02:41.643 --> 01:02:42.768
Please! They're white!

01:02:42.769 --> 01:02:43.644
Please! They're white!

01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:45.312
Why didn't you say that?

01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:47.398
Oh, my God! You
should lead with that!

01:02:47.399 --> 01:02:50.526
I mean, if you're black we just
assume that your hauntings are...

01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:53.028
bill collectors or
racist police officers.

01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:56.407
But 99% of all hauntings happen
to white people, that's a fact.

01:02:56.408 --> 01:02:56.991
But 99% of all hauntings happen
to white people, that's a fact.

01:02:56.992 --> 01:03:00.327
What he means to say is,
of course we'll help you.

01:03:00.328 --> 01:03:01.370
Thank you so much.

01:03:01.371 --> 01:03:03.330
So we're here to help you people.

01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.750
And before you get worked up,
I mean "you people" as a couple.

01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:07.752
It wasn't racist
till you explained it.

01:03:07.753 --> 01:03:08.377
Yeah.

01:03:08.378 --> 01:03:10.004
The bad news is, you have
a demon in your house.

01:03:10.005 --> 01:03:11.505
The bad news is, you have
a demon in your house.

01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:12.590
Here we go again.

01:03:12.591 --> 01:03:15.509
Okay, wait. So the
house really is haunted?

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.013
Megan, it's not the
house that's haunted.

01:03:19.014 --> 01:03:22.349
I knew it! I knew it! It's
always the little white girl.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.601
Think about it. "The Exorcist",
"The Last Exorcism"...

01:03:23.602 --> 01:03:25.186
Think about it. "The Exorcist",
"The Last Exorcism"...

01:03:25.187 --> 01:03:27.521
"The Exorcism of Emily
Rose", all white girls.

01:03:27.522 --> 01:03:29.356
'Cause ain't no black parents
gonna have no white girls...

01:03:29.357 --> 01:03:31.275
talkin' like that.
"Bitch, whatta you mean?

01:03:31.276 --> 01:03:33.402
Who're you cursin' at? And turn
the fuckin' air down in here!"

01:03:33.403 --> 01:03:35.112
Malcolm, just listen for a second.

01:03:35.113 --> 01:03:37.239
When we first met you,
there was something...

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:37.615
When we first met you,
there was something...

01:03:37.616 --> 01:03:39.658
attached to you.

01:03:39.659 --> 01:03:42.286
That was a hemorrhoid.
That was... it's good now.

01:03:42.287 --> 01:03:44.705
This dark entity has
attached itself to him...

01:03:44.706 --> 01:03:47.082
and now it's feeding
off of all of you.

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:49.960
So what you're saying is that
this is all Malcolm's fault.

01:03:49.961 --> 01:03:50.669
That's right.

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.836
Your family could've left here
at any time, but now you're stuck.

01:03:50.837 --> 01:03:54.298
Your family could've left here
at any time, but now you're stuck.

01:03:54.299 --> 01:03:56.634
Like a piece of toilet
paper stuck on your shoe...

01:03:56.635 --> 01:03:58.135
when you leave the bathroom.

01:03:58.136 --> 01:04:00.304
Your wife knew the whole time,
but she didn't tell you...

01:04:00.305 --> 01:04:02.306
because she wanted
you to walk around...

01:04:02.307 --> 01:04:04.475
- ...and look like an idiot.
- Get over it!

01:04:04.476 --> 01:04:04.642
- ....and look like an idiot.
- Get over it!

01:04:04.643 --> 01:04:07.019
I'm not the one who
had an affair with...

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.146
some low rent palm
reader from Akron!

01:04:09.147 --> 01:04:11.190
And you never would've known
if you weren't a psychic!

01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:13.659
But I am psychic, Ned!

01:04:14.653 --> 01:04:15.986
What is that for?

01:04:15.987 --> 01:04:18.072
What you're thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds:

01:04:18.073 --> 01:04:18.489
What you're thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds:

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.493
One, two, see?

01:04:23.995 --> 01:04:25.996
We came on short notice.

01:04:25.997 --> 01:04:28.165
We may need an extra pair of hands.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:32.011
- Anyone you trust to help?
- I know a guy. He's Mexican.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.178
Megan, let's go to your contacts.

01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:40.177
Hey, nice camera.

01:04:40.178 --> 01:04:43.097
I take it your third cousin
owns electronics shops.

01:04:43.098 --> 01:04:44.098
Somethin' like that.

01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:45.307
He sells them out of
the back of his truck.

01:04:45.308 --> 01:04:45.641
He sells them out of
the back of his truck.

01:04:45.642 --> 01:04:47.977
It's a mobile operation.
Let me know if you want one.

01:04:47.978 --> 01:04:50.062
Hey, Ned, something weird.

01:04:50.063 --> 01:04:53.315
All these clocks stop at 3:27
when the hauntings happen.

01:04:53.316 --> 01:04:57.787
Normally, it's 3:07.
Nope, we're on CP time.

01:04:58.154 --> 01:04:58.529
The demon will manifest
itself in many ways.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:01.115
The demon will manifest
itself in many ways.

01:05:01.116 --> 01:05:03.200
To your son, it's
his imaginary friend.

01:05:03.201 --> 01:05:05.536
To your daughter it's
the voice inside the box.

01:05:05.537 --> 01:05:08.122
For Malcolm it's that
sexy little doll Abigail.

01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:09.665
See? It's a manifestation!

01:05:09.666 --> 01:05:11.667
You think I'd bang
a doll for no reason?

01:05:11.668 --> 01:05:12.126
- Malcolm! Shut up.
- What we're about to do...

01:05:12.127 --> 01:05:13.669
- Malcolm! Shut up.
- What we're about to do...

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.339
is the first step in banishing
the demon to the netherworld.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.507
What is that?

01:05:18.508 --> 01:05:21.343
This helps me communicate
with the demon.

01:05:21.344 --> 01:05:24.430
Organic, hydroponically
grown OG Kush.

01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:25.723
Very strong.

01:05:25.724 --> 01:05:27.683
Very strong.

01:05:27.684 --> 01:05:30.653
This is some good shit.

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:35.691
- Pass the man the shit.
- We grow it ourselves.

01:05:35.692 --> 01:05:39.278
- High water bill.
- That's that shit right there!

01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:39.361
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the further.

01:05:39.362 --> 01:05:41.739
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the further.

01:05:41.948 --> 01:05:43.415
Tony!

01:05:43.658 --> 01:05:46.581
Tony, where are you?

01:05:48.955 --> 01:05:51.423
Smells like that OG Kush.

01:05:58.632 --> 01:06:00.429
Mom!

01:06:02.636 --> 01:06:04.103
Becky!

01:06:05.972 --> 01:06:06.597
- Cool!
- Wyatt, get upstairs!

01:06:06.598 --> 01:06:08.015
- Cool!
- Wyatt, get upstairs!

01:06:08.016 --> 01:06:10.769
Fuck you, you bitch!

01:06:11.978 --> 01:06:13.979
Why are you tying
my baby to a chair?

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.648
Because the bitch
got a demon in her!

01:06:15.649 --> 01:06:16.982
Make it stop!

01:06:16.983 --> 01:06:19.985
This is some scary
Cucui shit right here.

01:06:19.986 --> 01:06:20.194
I don't know who Cucui is.

01:06:20.195 --> 01:06:21.445
I don't know who Cucui is.

01:06:21.446 --> 01:06:23.447
A Cucui is a ghetto
Mexican bogeyman.

01:06:23.448 --> 01:06:26.492
- Like George Lopez.
- I know, huh?

01:06:26.493 --> 01:06:29.244
I agree, it is scary as fuck.

01:06:29.245 --> 01:06:31.789
This spirit is more
powerful than I thought.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.791
We're gonna need to get a priest
to perform a real exorcism.

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:34.959
We're gonna need to get a priest
to perform a real exorcism.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.430
I know a guy! He's a
little unconventional.

01:06:39.631 --> 01:06:41.758
I don't know, Malcolm.

01:06:41.967 --> 01:06:43.968
I know, that bitch
don't look right.

01:06:43.969 --> 01:06:46.971
Why you gotta call her a bitch?
You disrespectin' the little ho.

01:06:46.972 --> 01:06:47.429
Nigga, did you just sell me out?

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:48.305
Nigga, did you just sell me out?

01:06:48.306 --> 01:06:50.474
There's certain words
that trigger white folk.

01:06:50.475 --> 01:06:52.977
I mean, bitch, ho, slut.

01:06:52.978 --> 01:06:53.978
No offense.

01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:56.447
You can't say those words.
That's like our ni...

01:06:56.982 --> 01:06:58.315
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:06:58.316 --> 01:06:58.983
Fuck him.

01:06:58.984 --> 01:07:03.320
- We would never say that.
- Only behind closed doors.

01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:07.241
I mean, I wouldn't say it in a
bus or at the Atlanta Airport...

01:07:07.242 --> 01:07:10.369
or in a parking lot of a KFC,
but, yeah, I would say it.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.329
I got your back.

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.415
This is a lovely
scarf you're wearing.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:16.166
It's a sash, you
know what I'm sayin'?

01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:18.544
I'm selling these. This a
part of my new clothin' line...

01:07:18.545 --> 01:07:21.505
"Jesus Pieces", and I got like
the shoe that the Popee wearin'...

01:07:21.506 --> 01:07:25.342
in leather, suede, in green,
brown, and the Pope hats!

01:07:25.343 --> 01:07:28.512
- You know what, that's enough.
- Thank you so much.

01:07:28.513 --> 01:07:30.597
That's right.

01:07:30.598 --> 01:07:34.068
Can we help my daughter please?

01:07:34.185 --> 01:07:36.562
Hell, she went really
white girl on me.

01:07:36.563 --> 01:07:38.605
"Oh, my God!" I was like, whoa!

01:07:38.606 --> 01:07:41.442
- Speaking of white...
- Are you doin' cocaine again?

01:07:41.443 --> 01:07:43.945
Cocaine? No, man,
this stuffs molly!

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280
Can I try?

01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:48.499
It's all good, it's all good.

01:07:49.451 --> 01:07:51.285
I'm gonna take a
little pinch for later.

01:07:51.286 --> 01:07:52.953
He's just bringing his drugs?

01:07:52.954 --> 01:07:54.955
- It's molly.
- Wrap it up!

01:07:54.956 --> 01:07:56.924
Hey, chill. Calm down, man.

01:08:03.465 --> 01:08:05.466
Y'alls have some crazy
ass motherfuckers.

01:08:05.467 --> 01:08:07.468
Y'all thought I was
gonna shoot this bitch?

01:08:07.469 --> 01:08:09.636
I'm just gonna pistol
whip her until she weakens.

01:08:09.637 --> 01:08:11.638
You're not pistol
whipping my daughter!

01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:13.640
I am not pistol
whipping my daughter.

01:08:13.641 --> 01:08:15.768
The man's a genius.

01:08:18.063 --> 01:08:21.648
In the name of the Father
and the Holy Ghost...

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:24.109
I need three other white people.

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.528
Peyton Manning! Kristen Stewart.

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:28.121
Paula Dean!

01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:31.325
Malcolm, where's Doug?

01:08:31.326 --> 01:08:33.535
I can't find his
black ass in this dark!

01:08:33.536 --> 01:08:35.412
- Where the hell is he?
- Look for eyes!

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:37.081
Like a forest
creature in a cartoon.

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:38.582
Father Doug!

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.917
He's over here! He's over here!

01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:43.921
Doug, no! Nigga, please don't.

01:08:44.089 --> 01:08:45.923
Father, please don't!

01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:46.715
No, wait!

01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:49.259
It's better if he points the
gun at himself and not at us.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.929
- Just talk to him, Malcolm.
- Listen to my voice, okay, Doug?

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:55.265
This is not what niggas
do! We don't do suicide!

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:57.434
Murder, yes! Suicide?

01:08:57.435 --> 01:08:59.269
That's what they do.

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:03.115
Yeah, we do that. I've
tried at least 20 times.

01:09:03.566 --> 01:09:06.151
Motherfucker got me acting
all crazy, actin' the fool!

01:09:06.152 --> 01:09:08.746
You know damn well I
wouldn't peel my own cap!

01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:12.282
I can't stop it! I can't stop it!

01:09:12.283 --> 01:09:15.285
There's somethin' in my head that's
tellin' me to blow off my head.

01:09:15.286 --> 01:09:17.412
Is it this head? Is it this head?

01:09:17.412 --> 01:09:19.581
No, no, no! Yeah, up there!

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:23.127
Evenin' break. Who wants a mojito?

01:09:23.127 --> 01:09:25.295
Oh, the black guy still got a gun.

01:09:25.296 --> 01:09:28.381
Oh, God! This demon is
a son of a bitch, man!

01:09:28.383 --> 01:09:30.968
Father, why have you abandoned me?

01:09:30.969 --> 01:09:34.429
Is it 'cause I cuss a
lot, even during prayer?

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.932
Amen, motherfucker sour dough.

01:09:36.933 --> 01:09:38.100
Is it because...

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:42.104
I don't get Ryan
Seacrest? I don't get him.

01:09:42.104 --> 01:09:43.188
I know what it is...

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:45.607
'cause I dressed up as
a foreclosure sign...

01:09:45.608 --> 01:09:47.943
when people was getting
kicked out they house.

01:09:47.944 --> 01:09:49.944
On Halloween I just stood there.

01:09:49.946 --> 01:09:52.281
I know it was wrong,
but it was funny to me.

01:09:52.282 --> 01:09:55.284
Out all of the people
on the Brady Bunch...

01:09:55.285 --> 01:09:57.286
it was Alice that I wanted to fuck.

01:09:57.287 --> 01:10:01.165
In the station wagon, on top
of Mr. Brady architect desk.

01:10:01.166 --> 01:10:03.625
Just used it for
protractors and rulers.

01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:07.296
Is because I actually kinda
thought that it was okay...

01:10:07.297 --> 01:10:09.131
that Chris Brown hit Rihanna?

01:10:09.132 --> 01:10:12.134
I know that bitch hit him
first! She talk too much shit!

01:10:12.135 --> 01:10:14.136
Shit, Island Girl,
whatcha doin' to Chris?

01:10:14.137 --> 01:10:16.138
Why you goin' hoodies
bitchin' on my Chris?

01:10:16.139 --> 01:10:17.514
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

01:10:17.515 --> 01:10:20.309
- Somebody help me.
- Doug! Fight it, Doug!

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:24.188
No! Nigga, that's a bigass
gun! That's gonna hurt, nigga.

01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:27.112
Malcolm, he has a message for you.

01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:31.158
He says... "Huh, bitch?"

01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:38.702
We're gonna need another priest!

01:10:38.703 --> 01:10:41.163
It's too late. I have
to perform the exorcism.

01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:42.164
It's true.

01:10:42.165 --> 01:10:44.416
Although Ned's only formal
training was a "Ghostbusters"...

01:10:44.417 --> 01:10:46.210
summer camp back in 1988.

01:10:46.211 --> 01:10:48.337
Never cross a stream.
Never cross them.

01:10:48.338 --> 01:10:51.340
And he is dumb! I
mean, dumb, dumb, dumb!

01:10:51.341 --> 01:10:53.675
The point is, you can do this!

01:10:53.676 --> 01:10:56.053
Do you remember what you said
to me on our wedding night?

01:10:56.054 --> 01:10:58.513
"I have whiskey dick and I'll
make it up to you in the morning."

01:10:58.514 --> 01:11:01.725
No! You said God brought
us together for a reason.

01:11:01.726 --> 01:11:03.560
Doesn't sound like me.

01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:07.611
- Must've been really drunk.
- Just fucking do it, dummy!

01:11:19.535 --> 01:11:21.370
- Becky!
- Did it work?

01:11:21.371 --> 01:11:25.592
- I'm sorry for everything!
- I think you did it!

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.469
- Oh, fuck that!
- Oh, my God!

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:40.769
Time to die!

01:11:42.141 --> 01:11:44.476
- It was him! It was him!
- Don't be like that!

01:11:44.477 --> 01:11:46.149
It actually was him.

01:11:46.646 --> 01:11:50.150
- Got him in the knee.
- That looked like it hurt, jeez.

01:11:55.113 --> 01:11:58.115
- That's what you call a blowjob.
- A leaf blower?

01:11:58.116 --> 01:11:59.658
- Don't judge me.
- Malcolm!

01:11:59.659 --> 01:12:03.754
Demon, you leave
our daughter alone!

01:12:04.706 --> 01:12:06.999
That's not your daughter anymore!

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.167
I didn't mean like
a daughter daughter...

01:12:09.168 --> 01:12:11.170
Seriously? Malcolm, help her!

01:12:11.337 --> 01:12:14.590
- Okay. Goddamnit!
- Go get 'em, buddy.

01:12:15.383 --> 01:12:18.468
- Wyatt, are you okay?
- Yeah, but Becky...

01:12:18.469 --> 01:12:21.142
she looks pretty fucked up.

01:12:22.223 --> 01:12:24.266
Demon, I'll make you a deal.

01:12:24.267 --> 01:12:26.184
How about, you leave,
and we'll pretend...

01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:28.520
- ...none of this ever happened.
- The bitch is mine!

01:12:28.521 --> 01:12:30.731
You heard the man, the
bitch is his. I tried.

01:12:30.732 --> 01:12:31.732
Seriously?

01:12:31.733 --> 01:12:33.984
She said the bitch is his.
That's pretty emphatic.

01:12:33.985 --> 01:12:37.113
Malcolm, please help
me. I'm so sorry.

01:12:37.989 --> 01:12:41.658
Becky will rot in hell!

01:12:41.659 --> 01:12:42.993
Okay, which one is it?

01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:44.995
Rot in hell or you
want me to help you?

01:12:44.996 --> 01:12:47.794
- Malcolm, help her!
- The bitch is confusing me!

01:12:47.999 --> 01:12:50.000
Demon, you leave her alone!

01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:52.336
You take me instead!

01:12:52.337 --> 01:12:53.670
Deal.

01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:56.640
Wait, no, no, no.
Here, take him instead!

01:13:01.012 --> 01:13:03.013
I haven't heard a demon
scream for a while.

01:13:03.014 --> 01:13:04.514
I think it's safe
to go back up there.

01:13:04.515 --> 01:13:07.351
- I still have a bad feeling.
- For God's sake, come on, guys!

01:13:07.352 --> 01:13:09.695
- Come on!
- All right.

01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:15.150
Oh, my God! Wyatt,
get upstairs right now!

01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:17.361
They're cuddling! The demon's gone!

01:13:17.362 --> 01:13:20.197
I did it! This house is clean!

01:13:20.198 --> 01:13:21.531
Look at his eyes!

01:13:21.532 --> 01:13:23.700
They're rolling to
the back of his head!

01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:25.202
I think he's possessed.

01:13:25.203 --> 01:13:27.204
That's the face he makes
when he has an orgasm.

01:13:27.205 --> 01:13:30.123
- I think he's okay, you guys.
- This is not over.

01:13:30.124 --> 01:13:33.627
- Are you guys watching this?
- Yes, we're watching it, dummy!

01:13:33.628 --> 01:13:36.171
I'm so intrigued by this.

01:13:36.172 --> 01:13:40.258
Oh, man! He's all twisted
up like a chocolate pretzel!

01:13:40.259 --> 01:13:45.305
Such ﬂexibility and dexterity!
This is making me queasy!

01:13:45.306 --> 01:13:49.226
- He could suck his own dick.
- Somebody please help me!

01:13:49.227 --> 01:13:50.394
If I could do that...

01:13:50.395 --> 01:13:52.687
I don't think I'd
ever talk to you again.

01:13:52.688 --> 01:13:55.111
Stop it, you unholy demon!

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:58.869
- That is greasy shit!
- Probably Murray's.

01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:02.038
The power of Christ compels you!

01:14:02.657 --> 01:14:05.325
It burn like bum piss!
That means it's working!

01:14:05.326 --> 01:14:07.661
Pour the whole thing, like
I just won the Super Bowl!

01:14:07.662 --> 01:14:09.789
- Go!
- Are you crazy?

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:16.132
Is that all you got, bitch?

01:14:31.769 --> 01:14:34.187
Wait, guys! Stop! Everybody stop!

01:14:34.188 --> 01:14:38.108
- Malcolm, are you okay?
- No, I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:14:38.109 --> 01:14:39.405
What?

01:14:39.569 --> 01:14:41.611
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:14:41.612 --> 01:14:44.114
Oh, my God, I can't...

01:14:47.952 --> 01:14:51.955
- Puking like a runway model.
- I'm good. I'm good.

01:14:51.956 --> 01:14:54.458
You're gonna want to
Febreeze all of this.

01:14:54.459 --> 01:14:56.460
You're gonna wanna just clean this.

01:14:56.461 --> 01:14:59.089
I feel so much better now.

01:15:03.968 --> 01:15:06.812
Can't be too sure. Oh, shit.

01:15:07.138 --> 01:15:09.055
I gotta get the hell outta here.

01:15:09.056 --> 01:15:10.682
Once they see a black
guy in a pool of blood...

01:15:10.683 --> 01:15:12.642
you know who they're
gonna come after next..

01:15:12.643 --> 01:15:14.440
I gotta go.

01:15:14.645 --> 01:15:18.648
- Now this place is clean.
- It sounded better when I said it.

01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:20.275
Get the box.

01:15:20.276 --> 01:15:23.028
- Thank you, guys, so much.
- No need to thank us.

01:15:23.029 --> 01:15:24.696
We're happy to help. Come on, Ned.

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:26.740
And we'll just take
Abigail with us...

01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:28.325
as well, for safekeeping.

01:15:28.326 --> 01:15:30.327
Yeah, I know what you plannin'
on doing with that doll.

01:15:30.328 --> 01:15:32.662
- No, I'm a professional.
- She's a freak bitch.

01:15:32.663 --> 01:15:33.330
Stop it.

01:15:33.331 --> 01:15:36.041
How come Noreen ain't
pickin' up on the vibes?

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:38.126
You know how when you
try to last longer...

01:15:38.127 --> 01:15:39.586
you think about baseball?

01:15:39.587 --> 01:15:41.713
It's kind of like that.
Throws a haze in their head.

01:15:41.714 --> 01:15:44.466
It's the only way to survive
when you're married to a psychic.

01:15:44.467 --> 01:15:45.342
Come on, Ned.

01:15:45.343 --> 01:15:48.471
I know you're thinking
about fucking that doll.

01:15:54.519 --> 01:15:56.771
- You're had enough.
- Bye, doll.

01:16:00.983 --> 01:16:04.986
It's so nice being able to
just relax on the couch...

01:16:04.987 --> 01:16:07.455
and watch "The Bachelorettes".

01:16:11.619 --> 01:16:14.621
- You didn't hear that?
- What?

01:16:14.622 --> 01:16:17.207
My nigga senses is tinglin'.

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.000
It's like my Spidey senses.

01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:22.170
Would you hush? It is fine!

01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:24.969
My white senses say we're fine.

01:16:25.174 --> 01:16:27.676
Everything's okay. It's over.

01:16:27.677 --> 01:16:31.807
- Okay? It's over.
- Okay, okay. I'm trippin'.

01:16:33.933 --> 01:16:36.401
Listen to that, whiteness!

01:16:43.943 --> 01:16:46.278
You already know how it's
going down, motherfuckers...

01:16:46.279 --> 01:16:47.070
all right?

01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:49.072
I looked in my Dora
the Explorer app...

01:16:49.073 --> 01:16:51.074
this the motherfuckin'
correct address.

01:16:51.075 --> 01:16:54.077
This ain't a drive-by, homie,
okay? This a walk-in, homie.

01:16:54.078 --> 01:16:56.413
So ain't no escapin'! My
cousin is in here, Cuz!

01:16:56.414 --> 01:16:57.915
Y'all ready?

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:01.042
Hey, yo, Malcolm!

01:17:01.043 --> 01:17:03.762
Whassup my niggie? I'm here, Cuz!

01:17:05.506 --> 01:17:08.300
What the fuck are you
doin', man? I gotta...

01:17:08.301 --> 01:17:10.599
This is bullshit! Oh, my God!

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:13.435

bearings together, homie.

01:17:22.607 --> 01:17:25.108

01:17:44.128 --> 01:17:47.047
Head twisted all backwards, niggie.

01:17:47.048 --> 01:17:49.966

01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:56.973
"Love 'N Hip-Hop Atlanta".

01:17:56.974 --> 01:17:59.309
Don't nobody get killed on
there, but they need to, my nigga.

01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:01.144

01:18:43.312 --> 01:18:46.065
See if the nigga got
some money, though.

01:18:51.946 --> 01:18:54.072

You hit me with a brick!

01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.709

He's on the back of a
motherfuckin' milk carton, niggie!

01:19:11.215 --> 01:19:13.012
Good. He may have lived.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.718

01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:20.557

01:19:20.558 --> 01:19:22.475
The white girl's
neck, snapped it back.

01:19:22.476 --> 01:19:25.228
- Kisha did that shit?
- That bitch is gangsta, Cuz!

01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:27.313
I need to jump on her

01:19:27.314 --> 01:19:29.482

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:56.050
Twinkle, twinkle little star...

01:19:56.051 --> 01:19:58.386
She's right behind me, isn't she?

01:19:58.387 --> 01:20:01.561
