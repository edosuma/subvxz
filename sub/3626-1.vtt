18:59.660 --> 19:01.575
Oh, wow.
I didn't feel anything.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.403
Neither did I.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.798
[music continues]

19:10.932 --> 19:12.760
[car approaching]

19:22.248 --> 19:23.901
Well, Nathaniel,
you have a choice.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.077
Under the bed
or out the window.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.340
- What?
- My husband just pulled up.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.080
Your husband?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.908
I thought he wasn't supposed
to be home till next week.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.083
Seems he's home early.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.348
[groans]

19:36.218 --> 19:38.046
[upbeat music]

19:43.878 --> 19:45.445
[tires screeching]

19:45.532 --> 19:47.838
- Whoa.
- Nate?

19:47.925 --> 19:49.100
[Catherine]
'Honey, you're home early.'

19:55.106 --> 19:57.805
- What the hell's his deal?
- I have no idea.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.773
Damn that mother-chucker.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.646
Ugh! He-he's totally right.
I don't even like James.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.257
Thank you.
I was waiting for that.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.954
I only hooked up with him
a week ago

20:17.041 --> 20:19.218
because I knew that I couldn't
get off the plane alone.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.003
And it would kill me if Chuck
knew that he'd ruined my summer.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.875
Oh, B, I'm so sorry.
Was it really bad?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.877
I would be in my cabana
at the Hotel du Cap

20:26.964 --> 20:28.357
and there he would be.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.533
Amid all the fireworks
on Bastille Day

20:30.620 --> 20:33.580
all I could see was
that Chuck Bass-tard.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.147
The limo's taking me back in an
hour. You're welcome to join me.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.845
Dude, you're not going
to the White Party?

20:37.932 --> 20:39.629
Come on. Pretty girls,
white dresses.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.241
Unless there's a sprinkler,
I don't care.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.418
Besides, it's tourist season
in the city. Easy pickings.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.680
Ah.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.117
Okay,
and I don't want Blair

20:49.204 --> 20:51.162
throwing her
callboy in my face.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.381
At least I could
have gotten a more

20:52.468 --> 20:53.991
interesting stand in
than James.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.166
Do you know how hard
it is to find a good

20:55.254 --> 20:56.690
fake boyfriend
on short notice?

20:56.777 --> 20:59.823
Well, he was smart and fun
at tea yesterday

20:59.910 --> 21:01.216
and he's really cute, too.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.174
You don't have
to lie anymore, Serena.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.872
He served his purpose.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.004
Now that Chuck is on his way
back to the city

21:07.091 --> 21:10.225
I can dump James just in time
to go to the White Party stag.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.618
How was your date,
by the way?

21:11.705 --> 21:13.141
After a few hours
with that guy

21:13.228 --> 21:15.317
I needed lifesaving,
not guarding.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.580
Baby steps, ma cherie.
Baby steps.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.104
By the way, Archibald,
now that the summer's over

21:20.191 --> 21:22.019
I can tell you I never believed
any of the talk

21:22.106 --> 21:23.804
that you hit it
with my sis.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.417
- Good morning, Waldorf.
- It was until now.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.766
Nate, why didn't you
call me back this morning?

21:30.898 --> 21:32.029
I can't talk
about that here.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.379
So where's Princeton?

21:33.466 --> 21:35.555
I'm surprised you let
him get away.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.861
James goes to Georgetown,
and unlike you

21:37.948 --> 21:39.776
I don't lose something
if I let it out of my sight.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.865
When you told me your
secret girlfriend was older

21:41.952 --> 21:43.040
I thought you meant college.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.433
Not to mention,
Catherine's married.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.956
I don't know
where you've been

21:46.043 --> 21:48.524
but your boy toy
is a Princeton man.

21:48.611 --> 21:49.873
He and I talked
about it while you played

21:49.960 --> 21:51.266
dress up with Serena
last night.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.963
Catherine ended
it with me last night.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.965
- What? Tell me.
- You misheard, Chuck.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.532
He's always going on and on

21:56.619 --> 21:59.143
about his crew division
and his eating club.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.103
- It's Georgetown all the way.
- I knowhe said Princeton.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.583
- Georgetown.
- Princeton.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.803
Georgetown.
Serena, let's go.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.328
Well, I'm glad to hear you're
not seeing Catherine anymore.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.329
We can talk about it later.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.161
Eric, it's me. You were
at dinner last night.

22:17.248 --> 22:20.469
What college
does Blair's consort go to?

22:20.556 --> 22:22.341
Yeah, well, that's not
what he told Blair.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.865
Do some research, junior.
I'm in the mood to be right.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.174
[sighs]

[Dan]
'I can't believe
that I get a job'

22:31.524 --> 22:32.742
'working for
my literary idol.'

22:32.829 --> 22:34.527
And he-and he cans me,
you know?

22:34.614 --> 22:36.093
I did everything he asked
from-from picking up

22:36.180 --> 22:38.052
his dry cleaning
to keeping him sober

22:38.139 --> 22:39.619
before noon,
which was believe me

22:39.706 --> 22:41.011
the hardest thing
I've ever done.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.665
Harder than finishing
that story?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.232
I just couldn't write it, dad.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.060
I-I-I don't know why.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.453
You're talking to a guy
who couldn't finish

22:47.540 --> 22:49.933
a new song in 12 years,
I get it.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.544
'So what is the story
about anyway?'

22:51.631 --> 22:53.459
The dissolution of a
relationship between two people

22:53.546 --> 22:54.547
from different worlds.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.549
- Science fiction, huh?
- Yeah.

22:56.636 --> 22:57.985
Well, if I can offer some
fatherly advice

22:58.072 --> 22:59.943
from 300 miles away--

23:00.030 --> 23:01.249
[Dan]
'I-I haven't finished
the story because I haven't'

23:01.336 --> 23:03.033
dealt with my feelings
over the way

23:03.120 --> 23:04.557
I ended it with Serena.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.602
Couldn't have said
it better myself..

23:06.689 --> 23:07.995
...even if you'd let me.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.997
I've tried not to think
about her all summer.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.390
You know, I was afraid
if I did, that I would

23:11.477 --> 23:14.001
I would see that
I made a huge mistake.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.306
So I've just been trying

23:15.394 --> 23:16.656
to distract myself
the best I can.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.135
Well, you've been running
all summer.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.528
'Maybe it's time you stopped'

23:19.615 --> 23:20.573
'and you turned around
and faced it.'

23:23.924 --> 23:26.056
So not only did James Schuller
not go to Princeton

23:26.143 --> 23:27.536
he also didn't
go to Georgetown.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.103
In fact, I couldn't find
a record of him

23:29.190 --> 23:30.321
at any of the big schools.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.413
Since when did you
become Sherlock Holmes?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.416
- So you think James is--
- An untalented Mr. Ripley?

23:37.503 --> 23:39.548
If you want entree
to the upper class

23:39.635 --> 23:41.724
there's no easier mark
than a wronged woman.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.512
It's time to call
in the big guns.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.822
Mike, I need a background
check on a James Schuller..

23:52.909 --> 23:54.563
He's got a PI
on speed dial.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.522
- Nate!
- I know that face.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.219
That face is not your friend.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.829
My grandmother just informed
me you told her

23:59.916 --> 24:02.441
I'm gonna be your date
to the White Party this evening?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.051
If things are really over
with Catherine

24:04.138 --> 24:05.531
then why do I still
need to be your cover?

24:07.576 --> 24:08.490
Huh?

24:09.230 --> 24:10.927
James..

24:11.014 --> 24:12.799
...the past six days
have been exactly

24:12.886 --> 24:14.061
what I needed them to be.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.584
Me, too.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.499
And there's
something I've--

24:17.586 --> 24:19.022
Me first.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.633
[cell phone ringing]

24:20.720 --> 24:22.199
Sorry.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.864
Oh, what is it?
What did you want to say?

24:34.951 --> 24:36.518
I just wanted to ask
if you'd like to come

24:36.605 --> 24:38.389
to the White Party
with me tonight.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.044
Sure.
That-that'd be great.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.745
I know I shouldn't have
used you again

24:45.832 --> 24:48.008
after our conversation
this morning.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.836
No, I get it.
You have feelings for her.

24:49.923 --> 24:52.447
But let's just be honest
about why you wanna go tonight.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.405
You wanna check out
the competition.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.277
No.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.365
I just..
I-I wanna see

24:57.452 --> 24:59.019
her and her
husband together.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.499
Just once.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.153
Yeah, that's called
checking out the competition

25:03.240 --> 25:06.026
which is stupid
and potentially dangerous, Nate.

25:09.638 --> 25:10.596
Yeah, you're right.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.122
But since I've been stupid
and dangerous in the past

25:15.209 --> 25:18.517
I-I'm not one to talk,
am I?

25:18.604 --> 25:21.824
It-it was probably gonna
be an uneventful evening anyway.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.434
[chuckles]

25:23.522 --> 25:24.610
Pick me up at 5:00.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.137
Sometimes the stars align

25:30.224 --> 25:32.487
for two old friends
to come together.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.883
But sometimes they align

25:36.970 --> 25:40.364
for two old flames
to totally combust.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.627
Hey, uh, 14 Sandpiper lane?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.237
- Yeah, yeah.
- You go there? Alright.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.761
Wonder what the sky holds
for S tonight.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.011
I-I don't know,
you seem different.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.578
Well, certain things
are in remission, Mr. Humphrey.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.363
Not the least of which
is my former attitude.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.974
Going through something
like I did changes you.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.541
You can see things
differently.
