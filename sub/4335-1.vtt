02:34.521 --> 02:37.388
She shoots, she scores! Goal!

02:37.524 --> 02:39.719
- What? That's right! Give it!
- Nice kick.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.793
- Very nice kick.
- Give me the ball!

02:41.928 --> 02:43.623
Justin!

02:43.763 --> 02:47.563
- Drop... Put me down!
- OK. Down like...

02:47.700 --> 02:48.894
Oh, sorry.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.662
- Goodness.
- Hey!

02:50.803 --> 02:52.134
Hi.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.510
- OK, you are really getting good.
- You too.

02:59.646 --> 03:03.082
I mean, when we first started going out,
you couldn't kiss at all.

03:03.216 --> 03:06.185
- I meant at soccer.
- Really?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.344
Absolutely. You're...

03:08.488 --> 03:11.582
...probably already better
than half the guys on my team.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.192
Probably more than half.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.259
What do you mean,
I couldn't kiss at all?

03:20.400 --> 03:23.392
Don't worry. I've taught you well.

03:27.473 --> 03:30.033
I know.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.007
OK, but seriously, don't you think

03:32.145 --> 03:34.909
you'd get more playing time
at a school like Michigan?

03:35.048 --> 03:38.108
Maybe, but it's always been
about being a Tar Heel for me.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.219
I'm gonna wear that Carolina blue.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.719
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby!

03:42.855 --> 03:45.323
OK, what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field?

03:45.458 --> 03:47.483
- The school cut our team.
- Wait, what?

03:47.627 --> 03:50.187
- Not enough girls signed up.
- So they just cut us?

03:50.330 --> 03:52.423
They can't do that.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.128
OK. This is not over.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.673
Hi, girls. I heard the bad news.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.006
"Bad"? It's a disaster.

04:07.146 --> 04:10.172
Now college scouts
won't even get to see us play.

04:10.316 --> 04:13.683
I know. If there's anything I can do,
just say the word.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.914
Matter of fact, there is.
We wanna try out for the boys team.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.591
Anything besides that.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.195
Coach, come on!
You know that we're good enough.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.924
I don't know that
that's a thing that I know.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.124
What?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.997
All we're asking for is one shot.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.036
- Yeah.
- Girls,

04:32.171 --> 04:34.537
we have two weeks before school starts.

04:34.674 --> 04:39.304
Then we open against Illyria.
A rivalry game. We have to win.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.969
And we can help you win.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.480
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.015
What's going on, coach?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.486
The girls here want
to try out for the team.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.452
- You're not serious.
- All right, all right!

04:53.593 --> 04:55.788
You're all excellent players.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.795
- But girls aren't as fast as boys.
- Right.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.422
- What?
- Or as strong. Or as athletic.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.572
This is not me talking.
It's a scientific fact.

05:06.706 --> 05:10.233
Girls can't beat boys.
It's as simple as that.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.709
OK. Justin, you're the team captain.
What do you think about it?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.245
I think the coach said it all.

05:17.383 --> 05:21.080
Yesterday you told me that I was better
than half the guys on your team.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.585
What?

05:24.390 --> 05:25.516
I never said that.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.456
What are you talking about?
Why are you lying?!

05:28.594 --> 05:31.085
Viola! End of discussion.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.720
Yeah, tell her, man.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.561
Fine. End of relationship.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.604
- Come on, let's go.
- Baby, don't be like that. I...

05:41.341 --> 05:44.208
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.641
You are so full of...

05:46.112 --> 05:47.670
Back to practice.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.880
Sebastian.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.057
Sebastian?!

06:04.697 --> 06:05.823
Sebastian! Jeez!

06:09.302 --> 06:10.894
It's you.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.200
God, you and your brother
look scary alike from the back.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.433
I think it's your total lack of curves.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.804
Hi, Monique.
It's so good to see you too.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.176
I'm looking for Sebastian. Where is he?

06:22.315 --> 06:23.646
I don't know.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.775
Just remind your brother
how lucky he is to be in my life.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.150
And tell him to give me a call
if he wants to stay in it. OK?

06:30.289 --> 06:34.055
OK. Does he have your number?
1-800-BEYOTCH?

06:37.997 --> 06:40.022
She will do great things.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.931
I have a surprise for you!

06:47.073 --> 06:49.405
And this is why
I don't bring friends over.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.874
Mom, not now.
I had a really bad day, so...

06:52.011 --> 06:54.104
This is just the thing
to just perk you up.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.271
- Hold on.
- OK.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.609
Keep your eyes closed.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.344
- Eyes closed, closed, closed, closed.
- They're closed.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.716
All right. Surprise!

07:04.590 --> 07:08.321
Beautiful gowns
for my darling debutante.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.622
Mom, have I not
told you a thousand times?

07:10.763 --> 07:14.722
I have no interest in being a debutante.
It's totally archaic.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.732
How could I wind up with a daughter

07:16.869 --> 07:20.236
who only wants to kick
a muddy ball around a field all day?

07:20.373 --> 07:23.740
Well, the world has been set right, Mom.
They cut my team.

07:23.876 --> 07:27.243
- What? No soccer?
- Yeah, that's right. No soccer.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.042
- How sad.
- Yeah, I can see you're all torn up.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.641
Well, Justin's gonna love you in this.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.346
Yet another reason not to wear it.
I dumped him.

07:36.489 --> 07:40.050
- What? Why?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.026
He's so handsome and rugged

07:43.162 --> 07:46.097
and chiseled and great.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.666
Then why don't you date him, Mom?

07:50.837 --> 07:53.499
No, I couldn't.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.867
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Hey.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.531
You OK?

07:56.676 --> 07:58.974
Monique was looking for you.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.647
Why do you even date her, anyway?

08:01.781 --> 08:04.409
She's hot. It's a guy thing.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.916
But she's so awful.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.782
Hey, you know,
you could use the front door.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.551
And Mom can't see me.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.594
She thinks I'm staying at Dad's.
Dad thinks I'm at Mom's.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.357
In two days they both think
I'm going away to school.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.696
- That is the beauty of divorce.
- Where are you going?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.393
London for a couple of weeks.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.266
As in London, England?

08:26.405 --> 08:28.965
Yeah, my band got a slot
in a music festival there.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.576
OK, what are you gonna do about school?

08:31.711 --> 08:35.238
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me with that.

08:35.381 --> 08:39.613
Could you just, like, pretend to be Mom,
call Illyria, tell them I'm sick?

08:39.751 --> 08:43.244
Something that sounds like it
would last for two weeks, like mad cow.

08:43.389 --> 08:46.950
Sebastian, you just got kicked out
of Cornwall for skipping.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.561
This is not exactly the way
you want to start out.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.855
I want to be a musician.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.898
Last time I heard,
they don't need to know trigonometry.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.194
Besides,
if you want to chase your dreams,

08:56.335 --> 08:58.769
sometimes you gotta
break the rules, right?

08:58.905 --> 09:01.965
You know the percentage of bands
that make it to the big time?

09:02.108 --> 09:04.508
Probably the same
as female soccer players.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.477
I will see you in two weeks.

09:07.613 --> 09:08.978
Sebastian.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.516
- Sebastian!
- Were you talking with your brother?

09:12.652 --> 09:14.552
No. Yes.

09:14.687 --> 09:18.714
On the phone. He's at Dad's. Bye, Dad.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.291
Picture this:

09:20.426 --> 09:22.053
We're at the country club,

09:22.194 --> 09:25.925
they call your name,
and you emerge in this.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.463
No. Sorry, Mom.
I have a strict no-ruffles policy.

09:33.606 --> 09:38.703
Sometimes I just think you
just might as well be your brother.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.247
You know what?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.945
If you can't join them, beat them.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.283
You want me
to turn you into your brother?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.951
That's right.
I'm going to Illyria as Sebastian.

09:56.095 --> 10:00.657
I'll make the boys soccer team, and in
12 days beat the Cornwall boys team.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.166
You've taken too many
soccer balls to the head.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.133
You know I can do it, Paul.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.207
<i>Except for the voice, mannerisms,
the breasts, the mentality and...</i>

10:09.342 --> 10:12.470
It doesn't matter. Nobody at Illyria
has even met Sebastian.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.547
- They won't know the difference.
- They'll know he's a girl.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.650
- Oh, come on, Paul.
- Yeah, come on, Paul.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.547
Yeah, come on, Paul.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.550
OK. OK. I'll see what I can do.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.683
Yes!

11:24.583 --> 11:26.448
Where are you going?

11:26.585 --> 11:29.713
Mom, I told you!
I'm going to Dad's house for two weeks.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.720
No, you didn't. And you're not going.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.417
We've hardly spent
any time together this summer.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.959
Now go upstairs and unpack.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.461
OK, Mom, I thought about what you said.

11:38.597 --> 11:42.658
<i>And you know Monique is gonna
be there 24l7 with Sebastian,</i>

11:42.802 --> 11:44.895
so, I don't know, I was just thinking

11:45.037 --> 11:48.473
that maybe she'd show me the ropes
on the whole debutante thing.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.633
- This is so exciting!
- Isn't it?!

11:51.777 --> 11:53.335
You're gonna have so much fun.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.640
There's the formal ball.
And the luncheon.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.249
And, oh, did I mention
the fundraiser next week?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.579
It's gonna be a carnival!

12:00.720 --> 12:02.187
Look out!

12:02.321 --> 12:05.916
Your brother promised to be there,
so remind him when you see him.

12:06.058 --> 12:10.017
Oh, my little girl.
You're finally gonna be a lady!

12:34.086 --> 12:36.213
Are you sure I can do this?!

12:36.355 --> 12:38.118
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.918
What's up?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.325
Oh, my God, he knew!

12:46.465 --> 12:49.127
- I wanna go home!
- Relax. He was being friendly!

12:49.268 --> 12:52.328
We're not going home! Stop it!
I did not spend all this time...

12:52.471 --> 12:55.099
- It's your fault! Drive home!
- My idea?! You asked me!

12:55.241 --> 12:57.141
- I did your hair and makeup!
- Reverse!

12:57.276 --> 12:59.574
- I want to go!
- You're being a girl!

12:59.712 --> 13:01.577
- We're not going.
- Come on! Drive!

13:01.714 --> 13:03.579
- He was being friendly.
- All right!

13:03.716 --> 13:05.479
Let's run through it one more time.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.449
Let me hear the voice.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.487
Hey. What's up? I'm Sebastian.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.115
OK. Now show me the strut.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.292
Now, hawk a loogie.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.426
I'm so proud!

13:25.337 --> 13:27.498
- Get off me!
- Remember,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.870
inside every girl there's a boy.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.307
That came out wrong.
But you know what I mean.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.680
Vi.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.376
Be a good boy.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.348
See you guys.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.190
I can do this. I am a dude!

14:24.330 --> 14:29.165
I am a hunky dude!
I'm a badass hunky dude!

15:07.673 --> 15:11.473
Hey! Hey! What up?

15:14.213 --> 15:15.805
You must be my roommates.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.317
What's your name?

15:21.453 --> 15:24.911
- Sebastian Hastings.
- Duke Orsino.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.956
OK.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.425
OK, OK, OK.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.757
This is Andrew and Toby.
They live next door.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.867
Yeah. Freshman dorm's
that-a-way, twiglet.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.366
Seriously, how old are you?

15:37.503 --> 15:40.097
I skipped a couple grades.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.968
I'm brilliant.

15:49.248 --> 15:52.411
Anyway, do you know
when soccer tryouts start?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.109
Noon. You play?

15:54.253 --> 15:58.383
Absolutely. Center forward.
You know it, bro.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.049
So you play the beautiful game... bro?

16:01.193 --> 16:03.491
Brothers? Brethren?

16:03.629 --> 16:07.030
Yeah, I'm a striker.
Andrew and Toby are halfbacks.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.497
Schveet.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.603
OK, why do you have tampons
in your boot?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.442
I get really bad nose bleeds.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.549
So, you stick them up your nose?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.747
Yeah.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.480
What? You've never done that?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.686
Oh, my... Beckham does it all the time.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.124
- Seriously?
- Yes.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.729
Look. I'll just show you how to do it.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.196
<i>Take that off and...</i>

16:41.333 --> 16:44.097
...whatever that is.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.602
And you stick it right in.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.070
It absorbs right up.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.410
- Are you kidding me?
- That's disgusting.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.445
Oh, my God, your roommate's a freak.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.572
That's so disgusting.

16:57.716 --> 17:01.652
Let's start the season
how we finished the last.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.687
Sharp!

17:06.525 --> 17:09.118
What are you, the runt of the family?

17:18.203 --> 17:20.762
OK, shirts and skins.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.334
Pardon me, sir. I have to be a shirt.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.944
- What?
- I'm allergic to the sun.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.274
You're allergic to the sun?

17:30.416 --> 17:34.512
Very, very, very deathly,
deathly allergic.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.746
We like to accommodate here at Illyria.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.416
So I'll follow you around
with a parasol. All right, Nancy boy?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.723
You're a shirt.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.200
OK, guys, let's go.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.667
One, two, three!

17:51.804 --> 17:54.898
One, two, three! One, two, three!

18:38.050 --> 18:39.312
At ease, gentlemen.

18:43.322 --> 18:48.021
I've seen a lot of energy
and commitment out there today.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.355
And that makes a coach proud.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.057
Now, I want to split us up
into first string and second string.

18:54.199 --> 18:57.396
You second-stringers,
don't take it too hard.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.733
You're just as much part of this team
as the first-stringers.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.240
Apart from, of course,
playing the game part.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.003
Schuler.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.939
Haims.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.542
Potensky.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.182
Donner.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.020
Hastings.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.890
Second string.

19:24.029 --> 19:27.157
The rest of you, congratulations.
First-stringers.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.561
Now, hit the showers.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.928
Shower time.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.868
Shower time?

19:41.146 --> 19:44.912
- Hastings! No shower for you.
- OK.

19:45.050 --> 19:48.542
Principal Gold wants
to see you in his office.

19:53.825 --> 19:57.886
I'm over. It's done. They know.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.898
Sebastian's file.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.674
Sebastian...

20:10.809 --> 20:13.004
Could it be any bigger?

20:14.346 --> 20:16.075
Mr. Hastings.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.218
Horatio Gold...

20:21.353 --> 20:22.877
...headmaster.

20:23.021 --> 20:26.388
So very pleased to meet you.
So very, very pleased.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.426
Hello, sir. Heard you wanted to see me.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.961
I'd like to say welcome.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.308
I just wanted to have you in
to say welcome.

20:44.443 --> 20:45.967
See how you're doing.

20:46.111 --> 20:49.979
Yeah, I'm doing great, you know?
Just... busy being a guy.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.015
Being a guy. Yeah.

20:52.150 --> 20:56.484
Let's take a look at your file,
Sebastian. And...

20:56.622 --> 21:00.058
Seems to be... stuck a bit.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.484
There we go. All right.

21:04.062 --> 21:07.327
OK. Well...

21:10.202 --> 21:11.669
OK, you're busted.

21:14.206 --> 21:18.108
You don't wanna talk to the headmaster.
But I won't take no for an answer.

21:18.243 --> 21:22.612
Now, have a sit in the
headmaster's chair. Come on, have a sit.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.579
Sit it.

21:25.684 --> 21:29.950
So, Sebastian Hastings.

21:30.088 --> 21:32.556
- How do you like campus?
- Beautiful.

21:32.691 --> 21:37.025
You've been inspired by the
charcoal black and candy apple red?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.824
- You know it.
- Hey!

21:39.965 --> 21:43.958
Don't touch it. Ever. Ever.
Do not do that.

21:44.102 --> 21:47.435
You know, Sebastian,
I was a transfer student myself...

21:48.573 --> 21:51.940
...once upon a time.
Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.102
So I keep a special interest

21:54.246 --> 21:56.771
in the transfer students
that come to this school.

21:56.915 --> 22:00.407
Act as a... unofficial big brother.

22:00.552 --> 22:04.420
Don't be surprised if I just pop in
unannounced just to check up.

22:04.556 --> 22:08.117
Yeah, I look forward to it.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.057
Now scoot!

22:15.400 --> 22:16.594
Sorry.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.862
- Don't worry about it.
- My fault.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.266
What is?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.134
Getting to know the opposite sex,
are we?

22:25.277 --> 22:29.077
Male-female dynamics.
All that sexual tension.

22:29.214 --> 22:32.445
It's all part of the high school
experience. So continue. Please.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.609
But keep it clean, though. OK.

22:34.753 --> 22:39.690
Abstinence is key. Abstinence is...
The best way to not is to not.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.392
Yes.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.457
Is he always that friendly?

22:49.601 --> 22:51.796
Are you kidding? That's him being rude.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.430
All right. Cute shoes.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.668
You think so?
I got them at Anthropologie.

22:58.810 --> 23:02.439
- No way! They have shoes there?
- Oh, yeah. Right by the accessories.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.510
Here are your books.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.014
- Thanks.
- Well, I guess I'm gonna,

23:10.155 --> 23:13.716
you know,
go take care of some guy stuff.

23:14.826 --> 23:15.918
OK.

23:19.564 --> 23:24.194
There you go.
Have a great apple and sandwich.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.633
Hi! I would love a...

23:25.771 --> 23:26.795
- No.
- But...

23:26.938 --> 23:30.066
Hey, dudes. Mind if I join?

23:31.009 --> 23:32.306
Thanks.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.844
So those soccer tryouts were bogus, huh?

23:34.980 --> 23:39.917
I mean, second string? Come on, that's
ridiculous. Am I right? Am I right?

23:42.087 --> 23:45.022
So the game against Cornwall,
that should be interesting.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.886
And why would that be interesting?

23:47.025 --> 23:51.826
Well, my sister goes there, and she
used to date that tool Justin Drayton.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.453
I know him.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.896
- I made him cry once during a game.
- Wait.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.366
- That was you?
- Absolutely.

23:58.503 --> 24:00.334
- That was so funny.
- Wow.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.337
Is your sister hot?

24:03.909 --> 24:06.400
I guess so.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.308
She's got a great personality.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.143
Incoming.

24:16.888 --> 24:20.483
Oh, yeah! Check out the booty
on that blondie.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.923
Don't talk about her that way.

24:23.061 --> 24:25.052
Is that your girlfriend?

24:25.197 --> 24:27.825
He wishes.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.491
She was dating this college guy,
but he dumped her.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.103
I hear she's a total mess now,
really vulnerable.

24:33.238 --> 24:35.570
Confidence, self-esteem is way down.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.676
- In man words, it's time to pounce.
- Exactly.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.005
I hate that guy.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.188
Did you know bologna
is 38 percent hoof?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.382
Thanks, Malcolm.

24:53.525 --> 24:56.358
Looks like you got some competition.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.793
- It's just Malcolm.
- Total geek.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.865
She looks so sad. It's heartbreaking.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.900
It... it's just...
I can relate, you know?

25:08.039 --> 25:10.906
I mean, I just got out
of a bad relationship too.

25:11.042 --> 25:14.170
I mean, you think you know someone.

25:14.312 --> 25:17.907
And you realize it's all been a big lie.

25:18.049 --> 25:20.074
Every touch.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.584
Every kiss.

25:22.721 --> 25:27.249
Plus, you know,
you can never get chicks to shut up.

25:27.392 --> 25:30.418
All right, guys,
catch up with you later.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.497
Empty shower.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.770
Yes!

25:43.909 --> 25:48.573
I get to take a shower.
I get to take a shower.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.818
Malcolm Festes, dorm director.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.893
Shower shoes are to be worn
in the bathroom at all times

26:03.028 --> 26:04.893
except when in the actual shower.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.726
Did you not read
your Dorm Life pamphlet?

26:07.866 --> 26:09.265
It was in your cubby.

26:11.536 --> 26:12.935
Wassup, dawg?

26:13.705 --> 26:15.798
Yeah. OK, homey.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.077
Later.

26:23.214 --> 26:27.583
Hey. You forgot... this, Coolio.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.550
Word, G-Money.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.676
OK, Hastings, you're up!

26:54.879 --> 26:56.312
Hastings, are you deaf?!

26:56.448 --> 26:59.110
Come on, let's go!

26:59.250 --> 27:02.981
Get your butt out there! Come on!

27:03.121 --> 27:04.986
Get out!

27:05.123 --> 27:07.284
Jesus!

27:27.479 --> 27:29.310
Come on, baby. Come on.

27:43.228 --> 27:44.559
Rise and shine.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.928
Wait! Let go!

27:49.067 --> 27:50.091
Let go!

27:50.235 --> 27:53.466
Welcome to hell!

27:59.711 --> 28:05.445
Gentlemen! Let me present
this year's soccer newbies!

28:05.583 --> 28:07.551
First, you must remove your clothes!

28:07.686 --> 28:10.416
Remove their clothes!
Remove their clothes!

28:10.555 --> 28:11.920
Take your clothes off now!

28:12.057 --> 28:14.184
Remove their clothes!

28:30.475 --> 28:32.602
Hello. My life sucks.

28:32.744 --> 28:33.768
<i>- I'm done!
- What?</i>

28:33.912 --> 28:35.812
Everybody thinks I'm a loser deviant.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.108
I'll never see the field
against Cornwall.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.979
And I smell so bad
I'm convulsing people.

28:41.119 --> 28:45.180
<i>Pick me up, take me home and make sure
I never do anything like this again.</i>

28:45.323 --> 28:49.851
Look, Vi, I don't know what to tell you
about the whole soccer team...

28:49.994 --> 28:52.656
...but as for the social stuff,
I got an idea.

28:52.797 --> 28:55.163
<i>- You do?
- Yeah.</i>

28:55.300 --> 28:58.463
We're gonna show everybody
the man that you really are.

28:58.603 --> 28:59.865
How are we gonna do that?

29:00.004 --> 29:01.471
Go, Viola.

29:03.842 --> 29:07.642
High five. Nice.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.646
Man. Look who's here.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.716
Foxy mama.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.645
Don't look at him.
Maybe he won't see us.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.551
Spread out so it looks like
we got no room.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.683
- What's up?
- What's up?

29:23.828 --> 29:25.056
Go, Kia.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.470
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Kia.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.841
Hey, girl. How you doing, baby?

29:38.977 --> 29:41.343
- Not the same without you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.413
New school, new babe pool.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.983
I miss you, Sebastian.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.678
I've been thinking about you a lot.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.584
- Especially at night.
- Sweet.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.691
- And late.
- Even better.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.520
Did she just say that to Sebastian?

29:55.660 --> 29:58.424
- What just happened?
- Oh, Sebastian.

29:58.563 --> 30:01.589
OK, big, mournful sigh.
Bittersweet farewell.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.166
You're his plaything, baby.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.360
It was really great to see you,
Sebastian.

30:05.503 --> 30:08.529
Call me anytime.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.047
I'd tap that.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.673
Thank you, Kia.
You're gorgeous. And go, Yvonne.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.342
Women.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

30:26.691 --> 30:29.216
Sebastian? Is that you?

30:29.360 --> 30:31.385
Hey, what's going on, Yvonne?

30:31.529 --> 30:33.087
- Who's this one?
- Nothing.

30:33.231 --> 30:37.531
I mean, our school lost its top gun,
Sebastian Hastings.

30:37.669 --> 30:42.106
Well, time comes for a man
to move along, Yvonne.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.401
I know, Sebastian.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.737
In the end I wasn't
woman enough for you.

30:46.878 --> 30:48.106
No, you weren't.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.737
That's something
I'll always have to live with.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.442
- It just hurts, that's all.
- Love is pain.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.748
Just know I'll never forget you,
Sebastian.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.823
Ever! Never!

31:05.897 --> 31:08.730
Needy.

31:08.867 --> 31:13.133
OK. We might need
to do a little reevaluating here.

31:13.271 --> 31:16.104
- Yeah.
- Hey there, pretty lady.

31:16.241 --> 31:19.472
What? What are you, hitting on me?

31:19.611 --> 31:22.580
- I was just...
- "I was just..."

31:22.714 --> 31:26.582
OK, let me put a stop
to that little brain fart right now.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.882
Girls with asses like mine do not talk
to boys with faces like yours.

31:33.758 --> 31:37.922
I'm looking for my boyfriend Sebastian
Hastings. Have you guys seen him?

31:40.031 --> 31:41.328
Sebastian?

31:41.466 --> 31:44.026
Don't let her get too close,
she'll recognize you.

31:44.168 --> 31:46.261
What am I gonna do?

31:46.404 --> 31:48.634
- Keep away from me!
- I beg your pardon?!

31:48.773 --> 31:51.799
Pretty ladies.
OK, don't come any closer, Monique.

31:51.943 --> 31:53.706
- Sebastian!
- It's over!

31:53.845 --> 31:55.278
What are you talking about?!

31:55.413 --> 31:58.211
- I don't want to talk to you!
- Sebastian, come back here.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.180
You're hot, Monique. Smoking hot.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.252
Come here. Get! Get! Get!

32:02.387 --> 32:05.117
- But there are plenty of hot girls.
- Come back here.

32:05.256 --> 32:10.489
And the truth is, you have absolutely
nothing else to offer.

32:10.628 --> 32:14.359
And when my eyes are closed,
I see you for what you truly are,

32:14.499 --> 32:18.265
which is ugly! We're done!

32:21.172 --> 32:24.539
That was amazing!

32:24.676 --> 32:26.007
You the man!

32:26.144 --> 32:29.272
What's wrong with you guys?
Make some room for the man.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.279
Sit down!

32:31.416 --> 32:33.577
You're officially my idol now, man.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.114
There he is.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.189
- What's up?
- What's up, brothers?

32:39.324 --> 32:41.622
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Lovelies.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.284
- Holler at your boy.
- Yo! Yo! Sebastian!

32:44.429 --> 32:46.124
Can you get out of my way right now?

32:46.264 --> 32:48.391
I need your advice. I got lady troubles.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.696
I'm here for you, bro.
I got a lifetime of knowledge.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.665
How long did you date?

32:53.805 --> 32:57.070
Too long. Ball and frickin' chain, man.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.742
Dude.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.509
Justine.
Chick won't stop dogging me, man.

33:07.719 --> 33:10.916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She's in our class.

33:11.055 --> 33:14.422
Dude, quit blushing. That's lame.

33:14.559 --> 33:16.186
Shut up. I'm not blushing.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.522
Everyone, please take a slip

33:18.663 --> 33:21.393
and read off the name
of your lab partner.

33:24.402 --> 33:25.460
"Eunice Bates."

33:27.872 --> 33:30.204
You got to be kidding me.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.536
- Be nice.
- Yeah.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.440
She got something-something.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.412
Yeah, asthma and headgear.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.050
"Olivia Lennox."

33:43.454 --> 33:45.615
- You know her?
- I talked to her for a second.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.384
About what? She gave you the nod.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.584
- She did a good one.
- She gives good nod.

33:49.727 --> 33:51.126
Could everybody calm down?

33:51.262 --> 33:54.425
I can't believe you got her
as a lab par... Switch with me.

33:54.565 --> 33:57.261
I can't. I said her name out loud.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.631
Some guys just walk in the light,
you know?

34:03.775 --> 34:05.743
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.902
I don't think we introduced
ourselves before. I'm Sebastian.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.036
Olivia.

34:16.621 --> 34:22.059
I'm gonna be the best
lab partner you ever had.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.862
Cool.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.157
I gotta be completely honest.

34:27.297 --> 34:29.858
The whole dissecting thing
kind of freaks me out.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.764
So, think you may have
to take the reins on this one.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.533
Wow. Most guys would never admit that.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.936
Oh, crap, you're right.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.373
No, don't worry.
I think it's refreshing.

34:40.511 --> 34:43.002
- You do?
- No paper near the Bunsen burner.

34:43.147 --> 34:46.674
- Wait.
- What's this? Poems?

34:46.818 --> 34:48.945
Lyrics. They're his...

34:49.087 --> 34:51.521
My... my old stuff.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.920
"Wake up, I've been waiting for you."

35:00.264 --> 35:03.859
Those are really good. So honest.

35:04.001 --> 35:08.233
I know. I keep telling him...
me... meself... my... myself...

35:08.372 --> 35:10.237
I write songs too, Olivia.

35:10.374 --> 35:12.399
- Really? Wonderful.
- Check it out.

35:25.323 --> 35:26.847
You, you sit.

35:26.991 --> 35:30.757
You, go. Go!

35:30.895 --> 35:34.023
- Did you say anything about me?
- No. Was I supposed to?

35:34.165 --> 35:36.258
Come on. This is perfect.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.426
You get to spend an hour
with her every other day.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.663
You can convince her to go out with me.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.274
She had that option
for three and a half years.

35:44.408 --> 35:48.208
I'll tell you what. You do this,
I'll work with you on your soccer.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.871
I'll make you good enough
to make first string.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.176
- By the Cornwall game?
- Absolutely.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.842
OK, yeah. You got a deal.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.785
- You're the man.
- Yes, I am.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.765
Right.

37:54.405 --> 37:58.068
Oh, for the love of God! It burns!

37:58.209 --> 37:59.733
It just isn't fair, Malvolio.

37:59.877 --> 38:03.472
I wait three years for Olivia,
and then some transfer student comes in

38:03.614 --> 38:06.139
and suddenly she's acting like some...

38:06.284 --> 38:09.651
...obsessed, love-struck teenager.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.483
I'm not gonna take that lying down,
Malvolio!

38:13.691 --> 38:15.488
Yeah, I know. I know.

38:16.761 --> 38:18.160
You're absolutely right.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.662
I'll do some digging,
I'll find out what it is,

38:20.798 --> 38:24.097
and I'll nip his chances
with Olivia right in the bud.

38:25.536 --> 38:29.233
What's that? Oh, yeah, sure.
A walk. Sorry. Come on.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.339
You are so smart.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.034
Hello.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.941
<i>- Miss me?
- What's going on?</i>

38:36.080 --> 38:37.547
What's wrong with your voice?

38:37.682 --> 38:40.014
I just have a little bit of a cold.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.949
So... I'm still a little phlegmy.

38:43.087 --> 38:44.384
<i>- Call my school?
- Yeah.</i>

38:44.522 --> 38:47.753
It's all taken care of. Just make sure
you're back by the 12th.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.860
<i>It was so cool, Vi.</i>

38:49.994 --> 38:52.861
<i>We went on a couple days early,
and the crowd flipped for us.</i>

38:52.997 --> 38:56.228
<i>They wanted an encore, so we
did one of my songs acoustically.</i>

38:56.367 --> 38:59.268
- They went nuts for my lyrics.
- Oh, that's so cool.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.234
<i>And you were right about Monique.</i>

39:01.372 --> 39:02.805
She's history.

39:02.940 --> 39:06.205
<i>- She really is, isn't she?
- I got to go. I'll talk to you later.</i>

39:06.344 --> 39:08.972
OK. Bye.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.707
Trouble with your wig, Hastings?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.647
No, I actually...
I have a scalp condition.

39:14.785 --> 39:16.377
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.045
I really do.
It's really acting up during the...

39:19.190 --> 39:21.385
No, you don't.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.720
You've got male pattern baldness.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.829
Scoot over, kiddo.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.056
I don't know if you've realized,

39:28.199 --> 39:30.565
but recently I've started
to thin out myself.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.295
I've tried all the creams
and the butters,

39:33.437 --> 39:36.565
and I still can't seem to stop
Mother Nature's vindictive fury,

39:36.707 --> 39:39.073
and neither can you.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.735
There's gonna be a time
when you'll have to come out

39:41.879 --> 39:44.507
of the closet and just
accept yourself for who you are.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.172
A baldy. OK?

39:46.317 --> 39:48.581
But it's gonna be all right. OK?

39:48.719 --> 39:52.382
Oh, and between you and me,
chicks dig it.

39:55.059 --> 39:58.085
Hang ten. Yeah.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.756
Hi, Olivia. I don't want you
to be worried, but Malvolio's missing.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.196
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.201
If you see him, don't feed him.
He has an irritable bowel.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.862
Yeah. 'Cause that
would be my very first instinct.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.839
To feed the tarantula.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.607
Here's a wild idea.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.879
Have you ever thought
about going out with Duke Orsino?

40:24.021 --> 40:25.545
I see that.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.288
- Duke?
- Yeah.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.484
- No.
- Yeah.

40:29.627 --> 40:30.719
- No.
- Yeah.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.795
- Yeah?
- No!

40:32.930 --> 40:35.296
I mean,
he's good-looking and everything,

40:35.433 --> 40:38.231
but he's just not the guy for me.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.064
I don't know.

40:40.204 --> 40:42.798
Think there may be more to him
than you think there is.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.704
So you're telling me
he's not just another dumb jock

40:45.843 --> 40:49.142
who wants to hook up with me so
he could tell his friends, but too?

40:49.280 --> 40:52.807
- Insecure to treat you as an equal?
- Exactly.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.076
Tell me about it.

40:54.218 --> 40:57.517
You're the first guy at school
who hasn't tried anything with me.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.417
Trust me, you're not my type.

41:01.725 --> 41:02.851
Well, why not?

41:06.864 --> 41:08.923
You know, it's just...

41:09.066 --> 41:11.364
...I don't think of you in that way.

41:11.502 --> 41:12.992
We're friends, you know.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.367
You're actually one
of the few people here

41:15.506 --> 41:17.906
that I feel comfortable around.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.340
I feel the same way about you.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.709
Good. Then just take my advice.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.874
Go out with Duke.

41:27.017 --> 41:28.712
I'll consider it.

41:30.354 --> 41:33.790
So, what is that exactly?

41:33.924 --> 41:36.051
I think that's the spleen.

41:40.731 --> 41:43.222
OK, who's your daddy?

41:44.668 --> 41:48.900
I got her to agree to consider you.
You're halfway in.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.564
All right, OK. So should I ask her out?

41:51.709 --> 41:53.540
No. You don't want to freak her out.

41:53.677 --> 41:57.113
You got to have
a casual conversation first. Hello.

42:00.951 --> 42:04.250
Why do I get the feeling
you don't do this very often?

42:04.388 --> 42:07.983
Man, I just...
I'm not really good at talking to girls.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.218
- Why? You're hot!
- What?

42:10.361 --> 42:12.761
You know, you're an appealing guy...

42:12.897 --> 42:15.798
Man... guy... guy-man.

42:15.933 --> 42:19.096
Look, I don't know.
I just always say the wrong...

42:19.236 --> 42:21.067
I just always say the wrong thing.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.606
OK. All right. Come on. Let's get up.

42:24.742 --> 42:28.769
I want to try something. I'll act like
a girl, and you're going to talk to me.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.778
Do I have to?

42:30.915 --> 42:33.713
Yes! Because I'm Viola.

42:33.851 --> 42:35.910
- Duke? Nice to meet you.
- That was creepy.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.283
You really just sounded
like a girl just then.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.356
I used to imitate
my sister all the time.

42:40.491 --> 42:42.959
I got really good at it.
Come on. And get up!

42:43.093 --> 42:45.687
Come on. Ask me some questions,

42:45.829 --> 42:48.957
and if the chemistry's right,
things'll just start flowing.

42:50.668 --> 42:54.297
- Questions about what?
- Anything. Ask me if...

42:54.438 --> 42:55.666
...I like...

42:55.806 --> 42:56.795
...cheese.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.706
OK. Do you like cheese?

43:02.846 --> 43:05.679
Why, yes I do. My favorite's Gouda.

43:05.816 --> 43:09.149
- I like Gouda too.
- See?

43:09.286 --> 43:10.810
- See what?
- We're flowing.

43:10.955 --> 43:12.820
We're talking about cheese.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.356
So what? Flow is flow.

43:14.491 --> 43:16.618
What? What's that?

43:16.760 --> 43:19.354
What is that?! It touched me!
It touched me!

43:19.496 --> 43:22.693
It's Malcolm's tarantula! Get it!

43:22.833 --> 43:25.028
- You get it!
- You're the guy!

43:25.169 --> 43:26.158
The bigger guy.

43:37.047 --> 43:38.241
Sorry!

43:38.382 --> 43:42.216
You don't ever,
ever do that girl voice again!

43:42.353 --> 43:44.344
- Freaked me out!
- My bad.

43:48.826 --> 43:50.885
<i>Sebastian, honey, this is your mother.</i>

43:51.028 --> 43:53.895
<i>I'm calling to remind you
about the carnival tomorrow.</i>

43:54.031 --> 43:57.398
<i>You and your sister promised
you'd both be there. Bye-bye.</i>

43:58.736 --> 44:01.227
Crap! Forgot about that!

44:01.372 --> 44:04.398
- Wait, your mom's in Junior League?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

44:04.541 --> 44:06.907
So is mine. I gotta go too.

44:07.044 --> 44:10.502
I can't deal with this right now.
I have soccer to worry about.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.776
Not gonna be that bad.
Olivia's gonna be there.

44:13.917 --> 44:16.750
It's a perfect opportunity
for me to lay some groundwork.

44:16.887 --> 44:19.583
Oh, Olivia's gonna be there.

44:19.723 --> 44:21.088
And my sister.

44:21.225 --> 44:23.853
And Monique. And you.

44:23.994 --> 44:25.928
And my mom.

44:26.063 --> 44:28.258
Great.

44:38.409 --> 44:40.309
Dunk toss.

44:40.444 --> 44:41.433
Hey, dude!

44:41.578 --> 44:43.705
I will cut you, man.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.748
I'll tell you the truth.
I never really liked carnivals.

44:46.884 --> 44:51.821
Hey. I'm working the kissing booth.
Come see me.

44:52.756 --> 44:55.657
I love carnivals, man.

44:55.793 --> 44:59.229
- Hey, Duke, where you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

45:02.766 --> 45:04.529
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

45:04.668 --> 45:07.432
Just my psycho ex.
I don't really wanna deal with her.

45:07.571 --> 45:11.337
So if you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna lay low for a little while.

45:11.475 --> 45:14.672
- Cool. Catch you later.
- OK.

45:14.812 --> 45:16.245
Up you go!

45:18.982 --> 45:21.746
I see a kitten...

45:21.885 --> 45:24.513
...gasping for air.

45:27.991 --> 45:30.585
Sorry. Pretty urgent.

45:34.498 --> 45:36.489
It's all yours.

45:37.601 --> 45:39.262
Hi, Mom!

45:39.403 --> 45:42.964
You look like such a lady.
It's a miracle.

45:43.107 --> 45:45.507
- It really is.
- So Monique's getting you

45:45.642 --> 45:47.803
all excited about being a debutante?

45:47.945 --> 45:51.108
Super-duper excited.
Have a good carnival.

45:51.248 --> 45:54.183
My little petunia.
Where do you think you're going?

45:54.318 --> 45:56.513
You have the next shift
at the kissing booth.

45:56.653 --> 45:59.121
And your brother's late
for the cotton candy cart.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.225
I'm gonna go look for him. Bye.

46:05.629 --> 46:08.723
- Sorry.
- Excuse you.

46:08.866 --> 46:11.994
- Wait, do I know you?
- No.

46:12.136 --> 46:13.899
Excuse me.

46:14.037 --> 46:15.368
Viola! Hey, hey, hey.

46:15.506 --> 46:18.339
Where you been?
I've been calling and calling.

46:18.475 --> 46:19.908
I miss you. We need to talk.

46:20.043 --> 46:22.409
We've talked, Justin.
All the talking is done.

46:22.546 --> 46:26.243
Look, no one breaks up
over a stupid soccer issue, OK?

46:26.383 --> 46:28.476
Can you just be a girl for five seconds?

46:28.619 --> 46:30.246
For five seconds?

46:30.387 --> 46:34.084
OK, first of all,
it's not a stupid soccer issue,

46:34.224 --> 46:37.193
and you're a jerk.
Oh, look at that! Time's up!

46:39.663 --> 46:42.826
Excuse me. Sorry. One, please.

47:18.368 --> 47:19.995
Stay in school.

47:29.546 --> 47:32.447
Sebastian? Sebastian!

47:32.583 --> 47:35.245
- Monique's behind me.
- Where are you going?

47:35.385 --> 47:37.853
- We're on it.
- Sebastian!

47:45.395 --> 47:48.660
Excuse me. No one over 8 years old
is allowed inside the Moon Bounce.

47:48.799 --> 47:52.428
- I just saw my boyfriend go in there.
- The correct term is "ex-boyfriend."

47:52.569 --> 47:55.595
No relationship is over
until I say it is. Understand?

47:55.739 --> 47:58.230
You're still not getting
on that Moon Bounce.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.899
Fine.

48:05.349 --> 48:08.409
- What's that?
- Kia, don't look.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.880
God!

48:24.234 --> 48:27.499
- She's gone.
- Thank you.

48:27.638 --> 48:30.402
- So are we having fun?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

48:34.478 --> 48:36.139
What do you think it will be like?

48:36.280 --> 48:38.043
Duke, you look at me.

48:38.181 --> 48:40.979
I know it's gonna
be really, really special.

48:42.419 --> 48:45.183
I mean, she's only kissed
like 350 guys at this point.

48:45.322 --> 48:47.813
I just think we need
to acknowledge the moment.

48:47.958 --> 48:52.258
After four years, Duke
is finally gonna fulfill his destiny.

48:52.396 --> 48:57.424
Life is good.
Life is fair. Life is just.

48:57.567 --> 48:59.034
Hi, I'm your relief.

48:59.169 --> 49:01.364
- And yet...
- Thank God.

49:01.505 --> 49:02.870
I can't catch a break.

49:03.006 --> 49:07.966
Beware of the old guy chewing gum.
It's not gum.

49:09.613 --> 49:13.014
- Do I know you?
- No.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.252
That's just my luck.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.877
No. No, no, no.
I mean, I didn't mean it like that.

49:19.022 --> 49:23.049
<i>It's just, you know,
she's, you know... No. OK.</i>

49:23.193 --> 49:27.095
I mean, on the other hand,
you're, you know, also...

49:27.230 --> 49:30.996
- I am? Thanks, I guess.
- Yeah.

49:31.134 --> 49:34.661
You don't have to flirt with her first,
genius. You're paying for it.

49:34.805 --> 49:39.606
Why don't you just... relax.

49:41.511 --> 49:43.274
Maybe I should kiss you now.

49:43.413 --> 49:47.349
I gave that girl my ticket,
and I waited in line.

49:47.484 --> 49:50.885
Well, it's the least I can do.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.990
OK. Here I go.

50:10.374 --> 50:12.308
OK, I think that was one ticket's worth.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.103
No, you get a little bit more.

50:14.244 --> 50:16.906
Excuse me.
The motel's across the street.

50:17.047 --> 50:20.244
- Viola, what the hell is this?!
- Back of the line, buttball.

50:20.384 --> 50:24.218
Excuse me, doofus.
You're making out with my girlfriend.

50:24.354 --> 50:26.219
Ex-girlfriend.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.256
Whoa, you're Sebastian's sister?

50:28.392 --> 50:30.553
And you're about to die.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.457
Are you gonna drown me in your tears?

50:32.596 --> 50:34.962
I did not cry.
I had something in my eye.

50:35.098 --> 50:37.464
You know what, guys?
Can we just dial it down?

50:37.601 --> 50:40.434
And just step away, OK?

50:40.570 --> 50:42.868
She's right.
I'll see you on the soccer field,

50:43.006 --> 50:45.304
and we'll settle this all then.

50:45.442 --> 50:47.273
OK, Duke.

50:47.411 --> 50:50.471
Or we can straighten it out right here.

50:50.614 --> 50:52.673
Justin! Stop it! Guys!

50:57.294 --> 50:59.262
Stop it! Justin!

50:59.396 --> 51:01.421
Guys! Stop it!

51:04.701 --> 51:08.432
Justin, get off!

51:18.615 --> 51:21.175
Where's my daughter?!

51:21.318 --> 51:23.252
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

51:23.387 --> 51:26.914
Viola! Stop! This isn't ladylike.

51:27.057 --> 51:29.617
There is no room for violence here!

51:29.760 --> 51:34.163
This is a lovely children's carnival,
goddamn it!

51:34.297 --> 51:36.925
Both of you, out! Now!

51:41.738 --> 51:44.104
Where were you at today?
You just disappeared.

51:44.241 --> 51:47.301
Ran into my psycho ex. Had to bolt.

51:47.444 --> 51:49.469
Oh, my God! Is that a?

51:49.613 --> 51:52.514
What? Yeah.

51:52.649 --> 51:56.779
I hope you don't mind.
I kind of borrowed one of your...

51:56.920 --> 52:00.151
Yeah. And you're right, by the way.
These things actually work.

52:00.290 --> 52:02.383
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
Are you OK?

52:04.161 --> 52:08.222
I mean, suck it up! Be a man!
Rub some dirt in it!

52:08.365 --> 52:11.493
OK, I'll rub some dirt on it.

52:11.635 --> 52:14.900
So, what happened?

52:15.038 --> 52:17.063
I got into it with your sister's ex.

52:17.207 --> 52:20.699
Wait. Really? Why?

52:20.844 --> 52:25.645
He saw me and her kind of
making out at the kissing booth.

52:25.782 --> 52:28.512
Wait. You kissed her?

52:28.652 --> 52:31.246
Yeah, man, I'm... I hope that's OK.

52:31.388 --> 52:33.356
It was for charity.

52:33.490 --> 52:36.425
Oh, no, I mean, dude, I mean,

52:36.560 --> 52:40.360
if you want to kiss her,
you go right ahead and you kiss her!

52:40.497 --> 52:41.862
I mean, knock yourself out.

52:41.998 --> 52:45.434
I mean, you just...
you take her and then kiss her

52:45.569 --> 52:47.093
and kiss the crap out of her!

52:48.004 --> 52:49.665
OK.

52:53.743 --> 52:56.041
So...

52:56.179 --> 52:57.510
...do you like her?

52:57.647 --> 53:00.946
I don't know.
Can we not talk about this?

53:01.084 --> 53:03.279
She's your sister. It's kind of weird.

53:03.420 --> 53:05.547
No. Right. Right.

53:05.689 --> 53:10.319
Just... You know,
I was just thinking that,

53:10.460 --> 53:13.054
if you liked her then...

53:13.196 --> 53:15.596
...maybe you should ask her out.

53:15.732 --> 53:19.065
And just, I don't know,
forget about Olivia?

53:19.202 --> 53:23.866
Well, I mean,
speaking as a completely objective

53:24.007 --> 53:28.501
third-party outsider with absolutely
no personal interest in the matter,

53:28.645 --> 53:32.479
I am not sure that you and Olivia

53:32.616 --> 53:35.414
really mesh well together.
You know? I mean...

53:35.552 --> 53:38.749
But you and Viola...

53:38.889 --> 53:41.084
...I mean...

53:41.224 --> 53:42.555
...be magic.

53:42.692 --> 53:44.284
I don't know.

53:44.427 --> 53:46.987
What does your heart tell you?

53:47.130 --> 53:50.122
I mean, which one would you
rather see naked?!

53:50.267 --> 53:53.259
Why do you? Why?
Why do you always do that?

53:53.403 --> 53:56.429
Why do you always talk about girls
in such graphic terms?

53:58.241 --> 54:00.436
You know what? You... you have issues.

54:00.577 --> 54:04.377
You're a really sensitive guy,
aren't you?

54:04.514 --> 54:07.813
What? No. No, it's just...

54:09.352 --> 54:11.877
I don't know. I just think that

54:12.022 --> 54:16.220
relationships should be more
than just the physical stuff.

54:16.359 --> 54:18.884
Don't get me wrong,
that stuff's important,

54:19.029 --> 54:20.826
but when I'm with someone,

54:20.964 --> 54:24.559
I want to be able
to talk about other stuff.

54:24.701 --> 54:27.727
Like, I don't know, serious stuff.

54:27.871 --> 54:31.602
Stuff I can't talk about,
you know, with anyone else.

54:34.544 --> 54:36.637
Yeah, like...

54:37.814 --> 54:39.475
...what kind of stuff?

54:40.483 --> 54:42.747
I don't know, just stuff.

54:42.886 --> 54:46.219
Like, whatever stuff there is.

54:46.356 --> 54:49.883
Like... this kind of stuff?

54:50.026 --> 54:53.393
Yeah.

54:53.530 --> 54:56.090
But what I just told you
is for your ears only.

54:56.232 --> 55:00.066
If you tell anyone, I'll kick your ass.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.533
Yeah. No.

55:05.675 --> 55:08.803
I got your back, man.

55:08.945 --> 55:11.914
It's cool.

56:25.855 --> 56:27.186
How's your sister?

56:31.294 --> 56:33.524
Good. Why?

56:34.531 --> 56:36.556
I don't know.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.828
I kind of was thinking
I might ask if she wanted

56:39.969 --> 56:41.994
to grab dinner at Cesario's tonight.

56:42.138 --> 56:45.767
You were? Really? I'd love to.

56:45.909 --> 56:46.898
What?

56:47.043 --> 56:49.307
I'd love to give her your phone number.

56:49.446 --> 56:51.346
Hastings!

56:51.481 --> 56:52.880
Yeah, coach?

56:54.551 --> 56:56.849
You're first string
for the Cornwall game.

56:56.986 --> 56:58.078
- Really?
- No.

56:58.221 --> 57:01.054
I was joking, you idiot.

57:03.259 --> 57:05.250
Dude, that's awesome.

57:09.532 --> 57:11.193
Dude.

57:13.937 --> 57:16.804
- So, you want me to spot you?
- No.

57:16.940 --> 57:19.966
- Isn't he cute?
- Duke? Yeah.

57:20.110 --> 57:23.204
No. Sebastian. He's so cool.

57:25.115 --> 57:26.639
But he said I'm not his type.

57:26.783 --> 57:29.377
- Impossible. You're everyone's type.
- Not his.

57:29.519 --> 57:33.478
I could tell you what us mere mortals
would do in this situation.

57:33.623 --> 57:35.887
- What?
- Make him jealous.

57:36.025 --> 57:39.051
So, what do you do?
You just pretend to like somebody else?

57:39.195 --> 57:42.096
And then use him shamelessly.

57:42.632 --> 57:43.826
Wow.

57:46.202 --> 57:49.399
So, you should call Viola up.

57:50.507 --> 57:52.338
Yeah. I think I will.

57:54.611 --> 57:55.635
Hey, Duke.

57:55.779 --> 57:59.044
- Sebastian.
- Olivia.

57:59.182 --> 58:00.479
Olivia.

58:00.617 --> 58:02.847
What're you bench-pressing these days?

58:02.986 --> 58:06.149
225. Very impressive.

58:06.289 --> 58:07.813
Thanks.

58:07.957 --> 58:11.188
So, Duke, about that call
that you were gonna make.

58:11.327 --> 58:13.522
- You gonna make that?
- Yeah. Thank you.

58:13.663 --> 58:16.325
So how many reps
can you do with that 225?

58:16.466 --> 58:19.697
Like 20... 20.

58:19.836 --> 58:22.999
225 is more than twice what I weigh.

58:23.139 --> 58:25.198
How many reps could you do with me?

58:27.277 --> 58:28.437
Forty.

58:34.851 --> 58:35.909
Hello?

58:36.052 --> 58:37.280
Hi, it's Viola.

58:37.420 --> 58:40.355
<i>Sebastian told me to call you.</i>

58:40.490 --> 58:43.618
- I'd love to go to dinner.
- Yeah. What?

58:43.760 --> 58:46.490
Can I call you back?

58:46.629 --> 58:49.393
Because I gotta...

58:49.532 --> 58:51.864
...change my feet.

58:52.001 --> 58:55.562
So, do you have any plans tonight?

58:57.974 --> 58:59.066
My bad.

58:59.209 --> 59:02.940
What about the thing that we talked
about that you were going to do later?

59:03.079 --> 59:04.671
What thing? I'm thingless.

59:04.814 --> 59:08.511
Great! Then it's a date.
Cesario's, 8:00.

59:08.651 --> 59:10.414
- I'll see you there.
- OK.

59:11.988 --> 59:14.081
- Bye, Sebastian.
- Later.

59:17.427 --> 59:18.758
Yeah!

59:19.996 --> 59:21.190
You did it.

59:21.331 --> 59:23.526
I'm goin' out with Olivia.

59:23.666 --> 59:26.134
What the hell?!
I thought you liked Viola now!

59:26.269 --> 59:29.170
Dude, come on. You're a guy.

59:29.305 --> 59:33.071
What would you do
if the hottest girl in the school

59:33.209 --> 59:37.646
came up to you
and asked you on a date?

59:37.780 --> 59:39.247
I'll be right back.

59:39.382 --> 59:42.545
Olivia? Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?

59:42.685 --> 59:44.550
<i>Moi? Whatever for?</i>

59:44.687 --> 59:46.382
It's about your date with Duke.

59:46.522 --> 59:50.891
I know! I am so glad I listened to you.
You're right. He's awesome.

59:51.027 --> 59:55.088
And he looked so good
in those shorts.

59:56.633 --> 59:59.500
He's not a piece of meat, Olivia.

59:59.636 --> 01:00:02.503
He's a man. A man with feelings.

01:00:02.639 --> 01:00:05.073
And I'm a woman with feelings.

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:08.075
And my feelings seem to match his.

01:00:08.211 --> 01:00:10.577
You know what?

01:00:10.713 --> 01:00:14.171
Speaking as a completely objective
third-party observer

01:00:14.317 --> 01:00:17.081
with absolutely
no personal interest in the matter,

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.020
I'm not so sure that you
and Duke are a good idea after all.

01:00:21.157 --> 01:00:22.818
Well, thank you for your concern.

01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:26.690
And if you're so worried, maybe
you should come to Cesario's tonight,

01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:30.788
just to keep an eye on me.
We could double.

01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:33.061
I bet Eunice is available.

01:00:34.437 --> 01:00:38.396
I'm so there, it's insane.

01:00:50.586 --> 01:00:54.522
So do you like... cheese?

01:00:59.429 --> 01:01:02.887
- Hey, you two, what's going on?
- You're here...

01:01:03.032 --> 01:01:05.227
...with Eunice.

01:01:05.368 --> 01:01:06.392
Mind if we join?

01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:08.060
- No. Sit down.
- No, no, no.

01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:10.365
Lady pterodactyl.

01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:13.705
Waiter!

01:01:15.044 --> 01:01:16.170
Help.

01:01:19.749 --> 01:01:21.011
So...

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:23.516
...I was just telling Duke
how great it is

01:01:23.653 --> 01:01:26.178
to meet a real man at this school.

01:01:26.322 --> 01:01:28.256
You were?

01:01:28.391 --> 01:01:30.416
Well, I was just about to.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.960
Isn't it great to have
a real man around, Eunice?

01:01:33.096 --> 01:01:35.530
Oh, yes.

01:01:35.665 --> 01:01:38.156
A real man is difficult to find.

01:01:41.337 --> 01:01:42.804
So difficult.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:46.875
Sebastian's with Eunice.
She must be hotter than I thought.

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:49.877
How come when I wanted
to ask out Eunice everyone made fun?

01:01:50.013 --> 01:01:52.140
Sebastian likes her,
suddenly she's cool?

01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:54.010
Screw you guys. I hate high school.

01:01:55.918 --> 01:01:58.887
Eunice! Hands!

01:01:59.022 --> 01:02:02.355
You know what? This has been real fun,
but I have to go...

01:02:03.693 --> 01:02:05.661
...shave.

01:02:06.662 --> 01:02:08.027
OK.

01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:13.601
Well, this has been lovely.
Let's do it again sometime.

01:02:13.736 --> 01:02:17.103
- What?
- Soon. Bye.

01:02:19.142 --> 01:02:21.042
So...

01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:24.670
...do you like cheese?

01:02:24.814 --> 01:02:29.342
More than almost
any other animal byproduct.

01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:31.953
Yeah, check please.

01:02:32.088 --> 01:02:33.578
Hey Monique, it's Sebastian.

01:02:33.723 --> 01:02:35.918
I don't know
if Viola told you I'm in London,

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:38.254
but I'm heading home a day early.

01:02:38.394 --> 01:02:40.919
Listen, I've been thinking,

01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:44.500
and we really need to talk.

01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:44.734
Ladies...

01:02:44.734 --> 01:02:46.599
Ladies...

01:02:46.736 --> 01:02:48.397
Ladies.

01:02:49.572 --> 01:02:50.869
Welcome.

01:02:51.007 --> 01:02:54.943
My name is Cheryl Lancaster,
president of the Stratford Junior League

01:02:55.078 --> 01:02:58.536
and coordinator
of this year's debutante season.

01:02:58.681 --> 01:02:59.943
Oh, please.

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:02.881
Thank you. Today we're
gonna go over the guidelines

01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:08.150
for a graceful,
ladylike entrée into society.

01:03:09.425 --> 01:03:12.656
Son of a...

01:03:13.362 --> 01:03:14.624
Hello.

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:17.198
Hello there.

01:03:21.971 --> 01:03:23.734
- Hi.
- Make sure she's in the back

01:03:23.873 --> 01:03:24.999
for the group photo.

01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:28.338
Thank you for joining us, Viola.

01:03:28.478 --> 01:03:31.413
Now, who's ready to come out?

01:03:31.547 --> 01:03:32.673
Kill me.

01:03:51.234 --> 01:03:53.759
Viola? Darling.

01:03:53.903 --> 01:03:57.896
Remember, chew like you have a secret.

01:04:05.515 --> 01:04:07.881
Excuse me.

01:04:10.119 --> 01:04:11.711
Ladies.

01:04:24.534 --> 01:04:27.230
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:30.737
Hey! You're the one that saved me
in the kissing booth that one time?

01:04:30.873 --> 01:04:33.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:33.543 --> 01:04:36.478
Oh, what a small world. I'm Viola.

01:04:36.612 --> 01:04:37.704
Olivia.

01:04:37.847 --> 01:04:39.872
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:45.920
So...

01:04:46.055 --> 01:04:47.750
I know it's none of my business,

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:50.324
but you went out
with that Duke Orsino guy, right?

01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:53.860
Yeah. Once.

01:04:53.996 --> 01:04:56.226
- Did you kiss him?
- No, why?

01:04:56.365 --> 01:04:59.766
Oh, no. It's nothing, but...

01:04:59.902 --> 01:05:02.427
Just try to postpone it
as long as possible.

01:05:02.572 --> 01:05:06.303
He has this salivary gland condition.

01:05:06.442 --> 01:05:10.538
Yeah. He doesn't
really like to talk about it,

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.875
but it felt like I was drowning.

01:05:13.015 --> 01:05:14.346
Really?

01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:18.885
- Oh, my God.
- I know. It was repulsive.

01:05:19.021 --> 01:05:21.819
But, hey, every happiness to you both.

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:26.258
No, actually, I don't really like Duke.

01:05:28.431 --> 01:05:31.195
I have this huge thing
for his roommate, Sebastian.

01:05:31.334 --> 01:05:35.293
And I was just trying
to make Sebastian jealous.

01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:43.976
Oh, boy.

01:05:44.113 --> 01:05:47.241
Yeah, I know it's really wrong
to use a person this way,

01:05:47.383 --> 01:05:49.943
and I feel really terrible about it.

01:05:50.086 --> 01:05:52.145
But I really, really like Sebastian.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:54.017
He's so handsome,

01:05:54.156 --> 01:05:56.647
not the goonish handsome
you see in a lot of guys.

01:05:56.792 --> 01:06:01.024
He's a delicate, like,
even refined handsome, you know?

01:06:01.163 --> 01:06:06.191
Oh, and when he smiles,
I just can't stop looking at him.

01:06:06.335 --> 01:06:09.395
He's just so wonderful.

01:06:09.538 --> 01:06:12.029
You know, Olivia...

01:06:12.174 --> 01:06:13.698
- It's Olivia, right?
- Yeah.

01:06:13.843 --> 01:06:17.074
I'm gonna give you just a little advice.

01:06:17.213 --> 01:06:19.010
- OK.
- Enough is enough!

01:06:19.148 --> 01:06:23.016
You are weaving a really tangled web.

01:06:23.152 --> 01:06:24.642
Like really, really tangled.

01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:27.984
And, honey... you got to stop!

01:06:28.124 --> 01:06:30.718
OK? So you just
gotta tell everybody the truth.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:32.259
Be very, very honest.

01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:35.728
Just let the chips fall where they may.

01:06:35.865 --> 01:06:37.196
- You're right.
- I know.

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:40.063
The next time I see Sebastian
I'll march right up to him.

01:06:40.202 --> 01:06:42.261
- You march!
- And I'll tell him how I feel.

01:06:42.405 --> 01:06:43.599
You tell him.

01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:45.673
Then I'll kiss him so passionately,

01:06:45.808 --> 01:06:49.005
that even the people
he hates will feel pleasure.

01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:52.542
Hello, Viola.

01:06:52.682 --> 01:06:54.513
Oh, this is not good.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.380
And hello to you,
you little homewrecker.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.217
- Who are you?
- I am Sebastian's girlfriend.

01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:02.847
Ex-girlfriend.

01:07:02.992 --> 01:07:05.187
OK, everybody's got to stop saying that.

01:07:05.328 --> 01:07:08.354
You were the one he dumped
in the pizza parlor the other day.

01:07:08.497 --> 01:07:11.193
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He did not dump me.

01:07:11.334 --> 01:07:13.962
We're just going through
a little bit of a rough patch.

01:07:14.103 --> 01:07:17.231
I heard he dumped you.
He dumped you big.

01:07:17.373 --> 01:07:20.740
It was just like a big, huge dumping.

01:07:29.852 --> 01:07:31.979
Are you crazy?! Are you OK?

01:07:32.121 --> 01:07:33.713
Get out!

01:07:35.624 --> 01:07:38.058
You are messing with the wrong man!

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.658
Get off me! Get off of me!

01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:15.596
- Get off of her!
- Let go of me!

01:08:15.731 --> 01:08:18.928
Ladies! Ladies, stop!

01:08:19.068 --> 01:08:20.763
Please!

01:08:23.839 --> 01:08:28.572
When debutantes disagree
they say it with their eyes.

01:08:30.345 --> 01:08:31.938
Well, Hastings.

01:08:32.081 --> 01:08:35.676
Why is it that I always find you
in the middle of a tussle?

01:08:37.353 --> 01:08:39.048
Bad timing?

01:08:39.188 --> 01:08:41.212
I am convinced he's hiding something.

01:08:41.357 --> 01:08:45.054
Nonsense, Malcolm.
He may be a little lost and confused,

01:08:45.194 --> 01:08:49.290
but deep down he's an all-American,
red-blooded male.

01:08:49.432 --> 01:08:51.524
- Just like yourself.
- Mom, I will pick out

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:54.397
my own dress.
And no, I will not wear heels.

01:08:54.537 --> 01:08:57.165
Because heels are a male invention

01:08:57.305 --> 01:09:00.502
designed to make
a woman's butt look smaller.

01:09:00.643 --> 01:09:03.475
And to make it harder
for them to run away.

01:09:08.818 --> 01:09:12.948
Malcolm, have you ever tried
to run away in high heels?

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:16.148
- No, sir, I wouldn't...
- Not that easy. Not that easy.

01:09:27.903 --> 01:09:30.633
Don't forget your guitar, Mr. Hastings.

01:09:30.773 --> 01:09:34.504
Just do it.
Just close your eyes and kiss him.

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:42.617
Sebastian.

01:09:46.788 --> 01:09:49.314
"Wake up. I've been waiting
for you to open your eyes

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:51.153
so I can tell you I think I'm ready.

01:09:51.292 --> 01:09:54.057
I'm ready to free-fall
into the unknown."

01:09:54.196 --> 01:09:56.687
I'll see you at the game tomorrow.

01:10:02.204 --> 01:10:04.672
I think I'm gonna like this school.

01:10:11.881 --> 01:10:13.576
<i>Monique, it's Sebastian.</i>

01:10:13.716 --> 01:10:15.911
<i>I don't know if Viola
told you I'm in London,</i>

01:10:16.051 --> 01:10:18.178
<i>but I'm heading home a day early.</i>

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.756
<i>Listen, I've been thinking.
We really need to talk.</i>

01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:24.860
London?

01:10:28.497 --> 01:10:31.227
Hey, brother.
Dinklage was looking for you, man.

01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:36.435
Dude. Hello!

01:10:36.572 --> 01:10:39.541
You know, it's... crazy

01:10:39.675 --> 01:10:42.439
how wrong you can be about a person.

01:10:42.578 --> 01:10:45.741
It's crazy.

01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:48.378
You think they're one thing,

01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:51.953
and then they turn out
to be the exact opposite.

01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:54.954
- What are you talking about?
- You're gonna sit there

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.926
and act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

01:10:56.926 --> 01:10:57.585
and act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.727
OK.

01:11:02.865 --> 01:11:05.527
All right. OK.

01:11:07.536 --> 01:11:10.061
I wanted to tell you, Duke, but...

01:11:10.205 --> 01:11:12.230
...you have to know...

01:11:12.374 --> 01:11:15.366
...I love soccer more
than anything else in the world,

01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:16.876
and I had a point to prove.

01:11:17.012 --> 01:11:19.480
What?! So you're telling me
that you used me

01:11:19.615 --> 01:11:20.912
to help you with soccer,

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:23.314
and then you turn around
and stab me in the back?

01:11:23.452 --> 01:11:26.888
Wait, what? Now I really don't know
what you're talking about.

01:11:27.022 --> 01:11:29.115
Save it, man. I saw you with her.

01:11:29.258 --> 01:11:32.125
- With who?!
- Who?! Olivia, that's who!

01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:34.889
- You kissed when you got out the cab!
- What cab?!

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.362
- We were supposed to be friends!
- We are!

01:11:37.499 --> 01:11:41.526
- You don't know the meaning!
- Olivia never liked you, OK?!

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.366
She was just using you
to make me jealous.

01:11:44.506 --> 01:11:46.440
But Viola, she's crazy about you,

01:11:46.575 --> 01:11:49.009
since the first moment
that you kissed her.

01:11:49.144 --> 01:11:52.580
I bet that's part of your plan. Distract
me so you can move in to Olivia.

01:11:52.715 --> 01:11:56.776
- That is not what happened!
- You and your sister have a good life!

01:12:00.589 --> 01:12:03.456
"The Hastings twins
couldn't be more opposite."

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.485
- Twins?
- Sebastian?

01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:09.154
Sebastian?

01:12:09.298 --> 01:12:11.061
Sebastian, open up!

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.828
It's Monique!
You have got a lot of explaining to do,

01:12:13.969 --> 01:12:16.403
followed by a very long night
of groveling!

01:12:16.538 --> 01:12:18.768
He's not here!

01:12:21.343 --> 01:12:25.507
Take his stupid cell phone.
Justine calls every ten seconds.

01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:30.951
This isn't Sebastian's phone.

01:12:31.887 --> 01:12:34.788
God! Sebastian!

01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:37.653
- Sebastian!
- Can I help you?

01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:42.928
<i>- Hello?
- Viola. Hey, baby.</i>

01:12:43.065 --> 01:12:45.727
<i>It's Justin. You know,
the big game is tomorrow and...</i>

01:12:45.868 --> 01:12:47.859
Viola.

01:12:48.003 --> 01:12:50.563
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:12:50.706 --> 01:12:54.699
2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007...

01:12:54.843 --> 01:12:58.279
<i>Nice night...2008.</i>

01:12:58.414 --> 01:13:00.575
Hey, Eunice.

01:13:02.618 --> 01:13:04.381
Sorry about running out on our date.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.219
That's OK.
My intensity scares some people.

01:13:09.358 --> 01:13:11.383
Yeah.

01:13:11.527 --> 01:13:13.722
Is something wrong?

01:13:13.862 --> 01:13:16.558
Got thrown out of my room.

01:13:16.699 --> 01:13:20.567
You mean... you need a place to sleep?

01:13:20.703 --> 01:13:24.730
I really do.
The Cornwall game is tomorrow.

01:13:24.873 --> 01:13:27.808
I've never had a roommate before.

01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:42.751
Wow. Vi, you set up all my stuff.

01:13:42.891 --> 01:13:44.882
Thanks.

01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:11.419
- You're absolutely certain about this?
- Yes, sir, we are.

01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:15.554
- Dude, what are you doing?!
- Sebastian, the game's about to start!

01:14:15.691 --> 01:14:18.524
Get out of bed
and get over to the soccer field, man!

01:14:20.529 --> 01:14:22.520
The soccer game?

01:14:23.565 --> 01:14:25.624
That's what that girl was talking about.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:30.998
Sebastian! You're next. Hurry up.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.199
Come over here, and I'll do you.

01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:40.341
OK, ladies, listen up.

01:14:40.482 --> 01:14:41.744
Where's Hastings?

01:14:48.557 --> 01:14:49.546
Euni...

01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:51.716
Eunice! Why didn't you wake me?!

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.328
You looked so serene.

01:14:56.064 --> 01:14:58.328
I made breakfast, darling.

01:15:07.176 --> 01:15:10.043
Pardon me. Pardon me.

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:19.377
What is the big emergency?
I canceled my squash game for this.

01:15:19.521 --> 01:15:21.989
I don't know.
All that Principal Gold said

01:15:22.124 --> 01:15:25.651
was that we were needed
at Sebastian's soccer game.

01:15:30.199 --> 01:15:33.225
Hasn't Viola said anything
to you the past couple of weeks?

01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:35.495
How should I know?

01:15:35.637 --> 01:15:38.629
She's been living with you.

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:41.706
Hasn't she?

01:15:43.212 --> 01:15:45.544
- Excuse me.
- This is so exciting, guys.

01:16:09.104 --> 01:16:11.004
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:11.139 --> 01:16:13.573
The biggest rivalry
in our district is afoot.

01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:15.074
Illyria versus Cornwall.

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.111
It's gonna be something else,
and the atmosphere is crazy!

01:16:20.015 --> 01:16:21.414
Afternoon, gentlemen.

01:16:24.853 --> 01:16:26.514
Handshake, please.

01:16:31.126 --> 01:16:33.026
All right, your call.

01:16:34.263 --> 01:16:35.730
Heads.

01:16:37.266 --> 01:16:38.255
Heads it is.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.300
We'll stay as we are.

01:16:40.435 --> 01:16:43.029
Good game, gentlemen.

01:16:43.171 --> 01:16:45.196
How's your jaw?

01:16:52.547 --> 01:16:54.811
All right, let's get it on!

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.144
Way to go, boys.

01:16:56.285 --> 01:16:58.583
Listen to me.
We can do this. Today is the day

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.517
- Cornwall beats Illyria.
- Yeah!

01:17:00.656 --> 01:17:02.351
I ain't got much to say to you.

01:17:02.491 --> 01:17:06.052
- Who's gonna bring blood and pain?!
- Black and red!

01:17:06.194 --> 01:17:08.628
- This ain't no game. This is a war!
- Yeah!

01:17:08.764 --> 01:17:10.994
Who's gonna bring that blood and pain?!

01:17:11.133 --> 01:17:14.296
One, two, three! Cornwall!

01:17:19.508 --> 01:17:21.169
All right, boys, here we go!

01:17:31.119 --> 01:17:35.488
Hastings! Pass it off!
Pass it off! Hastings!

01:17:35.624 --> 01:17:37.649
What in the hell is going on?!

01:17:37.793 --> 01:17:39.522
Nice move, moron.

01:17:42.864 --> 01:17:44.729
What?

01:17:44.866 --> 01:17:47.027
This can't be happening.

01:17:57.412 --> 01:18:00.006
Sebastian?

01:18:05.587 --> 01:18:07.555
Get the ball! Get the ball!

01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:09.589
Get up, get back in there!
Get the ball!

01:18:09.725 --> 01:18:11.386
Oh, my God, this is my game!

01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:13.619
What the hell am I doing?
This isn't fun.

01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:15.423
You look like Bambi on ice, boy!

01:18:15.564 --> 01:18:17.156
Sebastian!

01:18:18.834 --> 01:18:19.858
Sebastian!

01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:28.899
Can I get a timeout, please?
A pause? One brief halftime?

01:18:29.044 --> 01:18:31.535
Stopping the clock.
That's it. Stop the clock.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.238
What the?

01:18:33.382 --> 01:18:35.543
I don't know the technical lingo.

01:18:35.684 --> 01:18:38.244
Armadillos. Fighting Armadillos, please.

01:18:38.387 --> 01:18:40.116
I need... Gather around.

01:18:40.255 --> 01:18:42.450
I played soccer as a young man.
Was it chess?

01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:46.322
- Is there a problem, principal?
- Yes. Unfortunately there is.

01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:51.489
But I think it's only right that
Sebastian Hastings tell you himself.

01:18:51.633 --> 01:18:55.069
Sebastian? Son? Or...

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:57.603
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:03.644
I'm sorry I'm not
a very good soccer player.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.004
I see.

01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:11.108
Well then,
please know that what I say,

01:19:11.253 --> 01:19:13.653
I say with a heavy heart.

01:19:18.326 --> 01:19:20.794
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed alumni,

01:19:20.929 --> 01:19:23.193
friends and family
of Sebastian Hastings,

01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:25.299
I am grievously sad...

01:19:25.434 --> 01:19:29.131
...to inform you that Sebastian Hastings

01:19:29.271 --> 01:19:31.569
is... a girl.

01:19:32.908 --> 01:19:35.968
Sorry, it's for your own good.
You'll thank me for it someday.

01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:37.305
Oh, OK. Certainly. Yes.

01:19:37.446 --> 01:19:41.348
Excuse me. I'm not a girl.

01:19:41.483 --> 01:19:42.711
Hello! Yes.

01:19:42.851 --> 01:19:44.785
In fact, yes, he is. He's a big girl.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.616
He's actually specifically
his own sister, Viola,

01:19:47.756 --> 01:19:51.715
who's been impersonating him
for reasons which will become very clear

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.794
after extensive psychoanalysis.

01:19:53.929 --> 01:19:56.227
Folks.

01:19:56.364 --> 01:19:59.333
I'm a boy. I promise.

01:19:59.468 --> 01:20:02.995
- Prove it.
- OK.

01:20:05.607 --> 01:20:06.631
God! I saw it.

01:20:06.775 --> 01:20:09.209
Nice work, Paul. Wow.

01:20:09.344 --> 01:20:11.073
That's my boy.

01:20:11.213 --> 01:20:12.737
Kevin, close your eyes.

01:20:12.881 --> 01:20:15.349
Soccer is the world's favorite sport.

01:20:15.484 --> 01:20:16.917
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:19.816
Nothing to see here. No offense.

01:20:19.955 --> 01:20:22.515
Folks, please, hang on for one second.

01:20:22.657 --> 01:20:25.023
Just talk amongst yourselves
for a second.

01:20:26.361 --> 01:20:28.761
Malcolm!

01:20:28.897 --> 01:20:32.731
Can you shed some light
on the current situation?

01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:38.105
Not any more
than has already been shed, sir.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.868
OK, lads, listen up now.

01:20:41.009 --> 01:20:44.206
Now that we've established this boy...

01:20:44.346 --> 01:20:45.938
...is a boy...

01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:48.447
...is it possible
we can get back to our game?

01:20:50.919 --> 01:20:54.286
Yes. Enjoy. That was a skit we...

01:20:54.422 --> 01:20:55.889
OK. Yes.

01:20:56.024 --> 01:20:57.548
Let's get to it, guys. Come on.

01:20:57.692 --> 01:21:00.126
- I know, let's play.
- Waste of time.

01:21:00.262 --> 01:21:05.427
Baby. Baby, baby, baby.
I have missed you so much.

01:21:05.567 --> 01:21:07.364
Oh, my God, we are both so dead.

01:21:07.502 --> 01:21:11.370
We're over, Monique. Done.

01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:15.403
God! Not again!

01:21:21.049 --> 01:21:23.108
Good work, Hastings.

01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:24.411
Bench.

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.631
Good one!

01:21:42.404 --> 01:21:43.837
Halftime, gentlemen.

01:22:04.726 --> 01:22:06.387
Sebastian!

01:22:06.528 --> 01:22:08.052
- Vi?
- Yes.

01:22:08.196 --> 01:22:09.390
Why do you look like me?!

01:22:09.531 --> 01:22:11.396
I pretended to be you
the last two weeks

01:22:11.533 --> 01:22:13.728
to prove I could play
in the boys soccer team.

01:22:13.868 --> 01:22:15.893
- Yes.
- OK. OK, cool.

01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:18.369
- No, wait! What?!
- I don't have time to explain!

01:22:18.506 --> 01:22:20.337
Why are you wearing my uniform?

01:22:20.475 --> 01:22:22.841
I came to find the girl
that kissed me last night.

01:22:22.978 --> 01:22:26.436
- Who kissed you? What girl?
- Check it out. That one.

01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:28.378
Olivia?

01:22:28.516 --> 01:22:31.508
She was all over me. She kissed me
and recited my own lyrics.

01:22:31.653 --> 01:22:34.019
Vi, this may be the girl of my dreams.

01:22:34.155 --> 01:22:35.816
That's the kiss that Duke saw.

01:22:35.957 --> 01:22:37.151
Wait, are those real?

01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:38.850
Yeah. I'm growing sideburns.

01:22:38.994 --> 01:22:41.326
No! Please stay hidden
until the end of the game.

01:22:41.463 --> 01:22:44.023
And give me my uniform back right now!

01:22:52.073 --> 01:22:54.371
We start the second half.

01:22:54.509 --> 01:22:58.240
Illyria, zero, Cornwall, zero.
Nothing but a couple of goose eggs.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.679
- Coach, I'm ready to play.
- Is that what you call it?

01:23:01.816 --> 01:23:04.512
I've seen little girls in tutus
kick the ball better.

01:23:04.653 --> 01:23:06.314
I've changed.

01:23:06.454 --> 01:23:09.048
Come on, coach,
give me one more chance.

01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:10.714
All right. Go.

01:23:10.859 --> 01:23:12.224
Kick. Kill!

01:23:25.874 --> 01:23:27.341
Yeah! Now that's Viola!

01:23:43.024 --> 01:23:45.049
You couldn't score on me
in the first half.

01:23:45.193 --> 01:23:48.856
You ain't going to score on me this
half, baby! I'm ninja! Ninja goalie!

01:24:00.342 --> 01:24:01.604
Come on, guys!

01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:44.141
Duke! Duke! I'm open!

01:24:44.285 --> 01:24:47.846
Give me the ball! Duke! Hey, over here!

01:24:47.989 --> 01:24:49.957
I'm open!

01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:55.058
Duke! Get back! Get back!

01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:01.000
No!

01:25:01.136 --> 01:25:04.037
Yes, Dan-O, way to go, baby!

01:25:08.977 --> 01:25:10.945
Cornwall's right back in it with a goal.

01:25:20.321 --> 01:25:24.052
- What's the matter?! Sebastian's open!
- Rather lose the goal?!

01:25:24.192 --> 01:25:25.352
Shut up, man.

01:25:25.493 --> 01:25:27.518
Duke, I know you're mad at me.

01:25:27.662 --> 01:25:30.563
Don't talk to me. Get out of my face!

01:25:30.698 --> 01:25:34.259
Nothing is going on with me and Olivia!
When the game is over I'll explain!

01:25:34.402 --> 01:25:37.701
For right now, you don't have
to like me, but I'm your teammate, OK?!

01:25:37.839 --> 01:25:40.364
I want to beat these guys!
I have to beat these guys!

01:25:40.508 --> 01:25:43.705
If we're not disturbing you,
we have a soccer game to finish.

01:25:43.845 --> 01:25:45.176
Get back in the net, man.

01:25:45.313 --> 01:25:47.372
Or you'll hit my fist
with your face again?

01:25:47.515 --> 01:25:49.506
Do you want to see me do it? Let's go!

01:25:49.651 --> 01:25:50.913
Duke, come on. Stop it.

01:25:51.052 --> 01:25:52.747
- Come on!
- Duke, stop it.

01:25:56.357 --> 01:25:59.417
Sebastian!

01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:01.722
Duke! Stop it!

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:03.558
Come on!

01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:05.863
OK!

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.366
Stop it! Oh, my God!

01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:11.267
If you want to roughhouse,
take it at least 500 yards

01:26:11.406 --> 01:26:14.204
- away from the stadium grounds.
- Break it up! Break it up!

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:17.569
OK, tough guys.

01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:21.478
You want to box?
You get out of my stadium.

01:26:21.616 --> 01:26:23.413
Otherwise, get on with the game.

01:26:23.551 --> 01:26:25.678
Come on, now, Armadillos of Illyria.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.651
That goes for the rest of you!

01:26:27.789 --> 01:26:31.054
Now get on
and play some real football!

01:26:31.192 --> 01:26:33.990
- Like a bunch of girls.
- OK.

01:26:34.128 --> 01:26:38.724
The rest of you, let's play some
real football like a bunch of girls.

01:26:38.867 --> 01:26:40.767
- All right?
- You suck!

01:26:40.902 --> 01:26:44.269
It's not football, it's soccer.
That's what we call it in the States.

01:26:44.405 --> 01:26:48.102
- Sebastian! Are you OK?
- No, Olivia, Not now.

01:26:48.243 --> 01:26:50.609
Try to tell me again
there's nothing going on.

01:26:50.745 --> 01:26:52.406
There is nothing going on!

01:26:52.547 --> 01:26:56.574
- What about last night?
- I didn't lie to you, Duke.

01:26:56.718 --> 01:26:59.312
I did, but not about this.

01:27:01.022 --> 01:27:02.319
Here's the truth.

01:27:03.825 --> 01:27:05.087
I love you.

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.049
I beg your pardon?

01:27:07.195 --> 01:27:11.256
What? All right... What're you?
That's just a little weird.

01:27:11.399 --> 01:27:14.391
OK, you know what?
I can't do this anymore.

01:27:14.536 --> 01:27:17.164
Everybody, I have something to tell you.

01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:20.803
I'm not Sebastian.

01:27:20.942 --> 01:27:21.931
I'm Viola.

01:27:22.076 --> 01:27:24.271
Wait. You're not Viola.

01:27:24.412 --> 01:27:26.937
- Yes, I am.
- No, I know Viola.

01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:29.572
- I... I kissed Viola.
- You kissed me.

01:27:29.717 --> 01:27:33.813
What are you talking about?
I didn't kiss you.

01:27:33.955 --> 01:27:37.550
The girls team at Cornwall got cut.

01:27:37.692 --> 01:27:40.855
The guys wouldn't let me
go out for their team.

01:27:40.995 --> 01:27:44.362
So I've been pretending
to be my brother

01:27:44.499 --> 01:27:48.595
while he was in London
for the past two weeks...

01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:52.934
...so I could make the team
and beat Cornwall.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.046
But my brother came home early.

01:28:01.182 --> 01:28:06.119
And that's who you saw kissing Olivia
and that's who played the first half.

01:28:06.254 --> 01:28:08.779
Because you wear a wig
doesn't prove you're a girl.

01:28:08.923 --> 01:28:11.187
OK, then.

01:28:13.194 --> 01:28:15.287
Merciful Jesus.

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:16.988
Yeah!

01:28:17.131 --> 01:28:18.962
- Viola?!
- Is it just me

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.568
or this soccer game
have more nudity than most?

01:28:21.703 --> 01:28:23.694
All right, so everybody understand?

01:28:23.838 --> 01:28:25.806
- Yeah. I get it.
- OK.

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.909
Wait a minute. If I kissed your brother,
where is he?

01:28:29.043 --> 01:28:32.638
Probably halfway to China. He
showed his willis and doodleberries...

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.304
- Present.
- Hi.

01:28:34.449 --> 01:28:36.383
What the?

01:28:36.517 --> 01:28:38.712
OK, this is freaking me out.

01:28:39.821 --> 01:28:43.348
Ladies and gentlemen, I hate
to say "I told you so," but I just...

01:28:44.492 --> 01:28:46.619
See, Duke? I didn't betray you.

01:28:48.529 --> 01:28:49.655
I'm sorry.

01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:53.597
This isn't how I wanted it to happen,
and I didn't want to hurt you.

01:28:53.735 --> 01:28:58.365
But I just wanted to prove
that I was good enough.

01:28:58.506 --> 01:29:00.599
All I'm asking for is a chance.

01:29:05.079 --> 01:29:07.047
Duke?

01:29:12.553 --> 01:29:15.283
It's just like what coach says
before every game:

01:29:17.125 --> 01:29:20.754
"Be not afraid of greatness.

01:29:20.895 --> 01:29:24.296
Some are born great.
Some achieve greatness.

01:29:24.432 --> 01:29:29.426
And some have greatness
thrust upon them."

01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:33.472
I think the best chance for us to be
great here today is to have you play.

01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:36.076
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:39.941
Yeah! Yeah! No!

01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:41.412
No playing!

01:29:41.549 --> 01:29:42.777
You have to forfeit.

01:29:42.917 --> 01:29:45.545
There's no girls in this league.
Look in the manual.

01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:49.417
What manual?

01:29:49.557 --> 01:29:52.526
Listen, pal. You're in Illyria.

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:57.427
We don't discriminate based on gender.

01:29:57.565 --> 01:29:59.430
All right.

01:29:59.567 --> 01:30:01.865
That's gonna bruise.

01:30:02.003 --> 01:30:07.168
Fine. You really think you can beat us
with a girl on your team?

01:30:07.308 --> 01:30:09.606
This should be fun.

01:30:09.744 --> 01:30:11.211
Go.

01:30:11.345 --> 01:30:13.779
I get to say the last word, not you. Go.

01:30:16.317 --> 01:30:17.944
OK, team...

01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:21.419
...let's go kick! Kill!
- Yeah!

01:30:21.556 --> 01:30:23.251
Come on! Come on!

01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:25.951
Well, folks, this is a real nail-biter.

01:30:26.094 --> 01:30:29.086
It's a tie score at the bottom
of the second half.

01:31:00.194 --> 01:31:02.025
Come on, come on! Open up!

01:31:18.212 --> 01:31:19.201
What?

01:31:19.347 --> 01:31:23.147
Foul? That's not a foul!
He got all ball!

01:31:29.157 --> 01:31:31.455
And the penalty kick
will decide the game.

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.727
Where you gonna kick it? Right here?
I know you're gonna kick it there.

01:31:43.871 --> 01:31:45.532
Am I in your head? Am I in your head?

01:31:45.673 --> 01:31:49.200
You see the goal? It's getting
smaller and I'm getting bigger.

01:31:49.343 --> 01:31:50.332
Come on.

01:31:50.478 --> 01:31:52.469
I love you.

01:31:52.613 --> 01:31:55.241
Concentrate. Don't kick like a girl.

01:31:55.383 --> 01:31:57.943
Guys are better. It's not gonna happen.

01:31:58.085 --> 01:31:59.985
You're a loser! This is my house!

01:32:00.121 --> 01:32:02.612
You're pathetic! I'm in your head.

01:32:16.003 --> 01:32:18.198
Yeah!

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:23.005
- That's my girl!
- Mine too!

01:32:34.222 --> 01:32:37.020
It's not fair! It's not fair!

01:32:37.158 --> 01:32:38.887
That was a lucky shot!

01:32:39.026 --> 01:32:42.962
I never wanna see you again! You suck!

01:32:50.271 --> 01:32:52.933
- You did it, Vi!
- You were so awesome!

01:32:53.074 --> 01:32:55.770
- I am so proud of you.
- It's over.

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:58.401
You scored the game-winning goal.
Say something.

01:32:58.546 --> 01:33:00.878
Mom? Dad?

01:33:03.384 --> 01:33:05.716
- That was really something.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:33:05.853 --> 01:33:09.482
- You did all this to play soccer?
- I told you, it's important to me.

01:33:09.624 --> 01:33:13.287
If Viola was here pretending to be you,

01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:15.361
- where were you?
- Oh, he was...

01:33:15.496 --> 01:33:17.361
I was in London playing my music.

01:33:17.498 --> 01:33:20.296
- London?
- It was important to me.

01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:22.902
- You should call before you...
- How did you?

01:33:23.037 --> 01:33:25.369
Mom, Dad... Hey!

01:33:25.506 --> 01:33:29.602
Why don't we go to dinner? As a family?

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:32.907
- Maybe tomorrow?
- I suppose I could fit that in.

01:33:33.047 --> 01:33:35.413
Would you like
to have my cell phone number?

01:33:35.549 --> 01:33:37.608
- Let me give you my e-mail.
- All right.

01:33:37.752 --> 01:33:39.185
Yay!

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.083
- Good job.
- Thank you.

01:33:41.222 --> 01:33:44.385
Oh, wait! There is somebody
I want you to officially meet.

01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:47.858
Sebastian Hastings, Olivia Lennox.

01:33:49.997 --> 01:33:52.329
- It's very nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:33:52.466 --> 01:33:55.731
So I heard you like my lyrics.

01:33:58.372 --> 01:34:01.864
- Eunice?
- Toby?

01:34:04.779 --> 01:34:07.270
I have something to say.

01:34:07.415 --> 01:34:09.940
I think you are...

01:34:10.084 --> 01:34:12.609
...amazing.

01:34:13.854 --> 01:34:16.118
And I'm not ashamed of it.

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.855
I know tricks.

01:34:21.996 --> 01:34:23.987
Oh, Eunice.

01:34:59.467 --> 01:35:02.129
Hey, roomie.

01:35:02.269 --> 01:35:04.897
This is for you.

01:35:27.194 --> 01:35:30.095
"The Stratford Junior League invites you

01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:34.099
to the 38th Annual Debutante Ball."

01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:40.001
- He still could show, you know.
- You didn't see his face.

01:35:40.141 --> 01:35:42.336
I found the perfect dress.

01:35:42.476 --> 01:35:46.344
Thanks, Mom, but I don't think
I'm gonna get a chance to wear it.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.572
Nonsense.

01:35:47.715 --> 01:35:51.708
You don't need a man
to wear a beautiful dress.

01:35:52.686 --> 01:35:54.677
But it doesn't hurt.

01:35:54.822 --> 01:35:59.282
Viola Hastings, it would be
my honor to escort you tonight.

01:35:59.427 --> 01:36:01.327
Thanks, Paul. That's really sweet.

01:36:01.462 --> 01:36:04.022
Caterpillars! My precious caterpillars.

01:36:04.165 --> 01:36:07.157
In 20 minutes
you'll all be beautiful butterflies.

01:36:07.301 --> 01:36:10.361
- Caterpillars!
- Butterflies!

01:36:10.504 --> 01:36:14.201
You look beautiful.
I just... I gotta get some air.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.935
I didn't think you'd show up.

01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:52.478
It really means a lot to me
that you're here.

01:36:54.648 --> 01:36:57.674
- Say something.
- I gotta turn the sprinklers on.

01:37:00.254 --> 01:37:02.119
Sorry.

01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:13.123
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:37:13.267 --> 01:37:16.293
So, what brings you here?

01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:20.105
Well, a few days ago,

01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:23.506
I kissed this girl at a kissing booth.

01:37:25.045 --> 01:37:29.812
And now I just can't seem
to stop thinking about it.

01:37:30.684 --> 01:37:32.584
Neither can she.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.089
Plus, I miss my roommate.

01:37:37.224 --> 01:37:39.488
I really liked him.

01:37:40.628 --> 01:37:43.062
Well...

01:37:43.197 --> 01:37:44.824
...he's right in here.

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:51.402
Listen, I know I should've
told you who I was, but...

01:37:51.539 --> 01:37:52.801
...I was afraid.

01:37:55.176 --> 01:37:58.407
- Sorry.
- Well,

01:37:58.546 --> 01:38:01.014
you know, maybe
if I'd have known you were a girl,

01:38:01.148 --> 01:38:03.514
we wouldn't have talked like we did

01:38:03.651 --> 01:38:06.848
and got to know each other
the same way.

01:38:06.987 --> 01:38:08.648
And that would have been a shame.

01:38:10.824 --> 01:38:13.292
Just so you know,

01:38:13.427 --> 01:38:17.864
everything you told me
when I was a guy just...

01:38:17.998 --> 01:38:21.866
...made me like you
so much more as a girl.

01:38:22.002 --> 01:38:25.028
OK, but just from here on in,

01:38:25.172 --> 01:38:27.868
everything would just be a lot easier

01:38:28.008 --> 01:38:31.375
if you stayed a girl.

01:38:31.512 --> 01:38:33.639
I promise.

01:38:33.781 --> 01:38:39.014
Monique Valentine,
escorted by Justin Drayton.

01:38:48.028 --> 01:38:49.427
Justin, you're the man!

01:38:56.437 --> 01:39:00.999
Olivia Lennox,
escorted by Sebastian Hastings.

01:39:07.982 --> 01:39:13.784
Viola Hastings,
escorted by Paul Antonio.

01:39:18.592 --> 01:39:21.026
Viola Hastings.

01:39:23.264 --> 01:39:25.994
This is typical. Well, where is she?
