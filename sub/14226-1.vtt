WEBVTT

00:06.755 --> 00:11.008
September 17, 2014.

00:13.478 --> 00:16.180
The day we arrived.

00:23.321 --> 00:25.639
We fled a dying planet.

00:25.641 --> 00:28.308
Our ship crash-landed here.

00:32.313 --> 00:37.000
For my kind, it was meant
to be a day of liberation.

00:37.985 --> 00:41.004
Refuge.

00:47.762 --> 00:51.265
But for everyone on Earth...

00:51.267 --> 00:52.883
it was an invasion.

00:56.971 --> 00:58.081
Shh.

00:58.117 --> 00:59.584
The humans left us no choice

00:59.586 --> 01:01.285
but to defend ourselves.

01:03.306 --> 01:05.456
Incoming!

01:26.829 --> 01:28.613
VunÃ­!

01:32.134 --> 01:33.685
I did as my father said.

01:33.687 --> 01:36.021
I ran as fast as my legs would carry me,

01:36.023 --> 01:39.708
not understanding what I was running from.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.777
And less sure what I was running to.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.067
National Guardsmen continue

01:49.069 --> 01:51.987
to engage in a bloody conflict
with the alien species,

01:51.989 --> 01:55.189
whose ship crashed to Earth
several miles from Baton Rouge.

01:55.191 --> 01:57.325
The President has issued
a state of emergency.

01:57.327 --> 01:59.995
While officials report
that some of the invaders

01:59.997 --> 02:01.529
have been rounded up,

02:01.531 --> 02:03.632
it's possible some may have eluded capture.

02:03.634 --> 02:05.417
What do you think would be the alien plan?

02:05.419 --> 02:06.585
We should go to my mother's.

02:06.587 --> 02:07.886
The roads are closed.

02:07.888 --> 02:10.422
And plus, things aren't gonna
be any better over there.

02:10.424 --> 02:11.890
Just try and relax.

02:11.892 --> 02:14.726
What's wrong, Daddy?

02:14.728 --> 02:16.077
Nothing, baby.

02:16.079 --> 02:17.395
Everything's fine.

02:17.397 --> 02:18.763
Don't forget to take your medicine, Emery.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.050
Okay, Daddy.

02:24.386 --> 02:26.721
Just getting word; NASA astronomers

02:26.723 --> 02:29.441
have speculated that the
trajectory of the spacecraft

02:29.443 --> 02:33.028
originated from a distant
solar system called Atria.

02:33.030 --> 02:34.579
Regardless of where they came from,

02:34.581 --> 02:37.231
local residents and world leaders...

02:56.018 --> 02:57.435
Hello?

02:59.755 --> 03:01.189
Hello?

03:11.150 --> 03:12.851
It's okay. It's okay.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.739
You're one of them, aren't you?

03:19.776 --> 03:22.327
I'll be right back.

03:28.051 --> 03:29.584
If, on the other hand, their goal

03:29.586 --> 03:31.252
was actual occupation and conquest,

03:31.254 --> 03:33.838
then they would probably
have to prioritize anything...

03:36.529 --> 03:39.130
It's okay.

03:42.385 --> 03:45.253
You don't look like a monster.

03:45.255 --> 03:47.305
You can stay here tonight.

03:47.307 --> 03:49.007
I'll come see you in the morning.

03:49.009 --> 03:51.476
Be very quiet.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.454
It's good, isn't it?

04:22.074 --> 04:24.292
Here. Use the fork.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.940
This one's called star.

04:38.942 --> 04:40.591
Through here.

04:40.593 --> 04:43.194
Through the loop.

04:44.447 --> 04:46.430
Let go, it's a star. Here, you try.

04:55.742 --> 04:57.826
Bravo unit one-seven...

05:02.715 --> 05:04.332
We've got to hide you.

05:05.167 --> 05:06.801
Got to go.

05:06.803 --> 05:08.436
He's in here!

05:10.590 --> 05:12.674
Go, go, go, go, go!

05:12.676 --> 05:14.676
Get away from her!

05:14.678 --> 05:16.478
Don't hurt him!

05:17.096 --> 05:18.980
- Now!
- No!

06:26.298 --> 06:28.800
It's been ten years since the alien species

06:28.802 --> 06:30.718
known as the Atrians arrived on Earth,

06:30.720 --> 06:32.536
and the U.S. military rounded them up

06:32.538 --> 06:34.705
and put them in a government facility

06:34.707 --> 06:36.391
where they remained in lockdown.

06:36.393 --> 06:40.094
Today, in a controversial effort
to integrate them into society,

06:40.096 --> 06:41.646
seven Atrian teens will become students

06:41.648 --> 06:42.880
at Marshall High School.

06:42.882 --> 06:43.982
Hey, Jules.

06:43.984 --> 06:45.683
Hey, Emery.

06:45.685 --> 06:48.186
Only you could pull off
sweaty sexy at 7:00 a.m.

06:48.188 --> 06:51.189
Outside Marshall High,
angry protesters demand

06:51.191 --> 06:53.741
that the Atrians remain
sequestered inside their sector.

06:53.743 --> 06:55.410
Time to stretch. Come on.

06:55.412 --> 06:58.396
My former hospital buddy's
now my personal trainer.

06:58.398 --> 07:00.081
You said you always wanted one.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.082
Yeah.

07:01.084 --> 07:03.284
Named Fernando.

07:03.286 --> 07:04.402
Or Tristan.

07:04.404 --> 07:06.371
With an accent and abs.

07:06.373 --> 07:09.123
These anti-integration
advocates believe the Atrians

07:09.125 --> 07:11.843
may be hiding a greater
plan to colonize Earth.

07:11.845 --> 07:14.345
If you ask me, this
whole integration program

07:14.347 --> 07:17.131
is just a distraction from the real issue.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.633
Is this on every channel?

07:18.635 --> 07:19.801
Yep.

07:21.270 --> 07:24.088
That ship is casting a
shadow over this whole town...

07:24.090 --> 07:25.756
All the loonies are out today.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.758
You got to love conspiracy theorists.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.593
One of them was claiming that the Atrians

07:29.595 --> 07:32.480
grow a medicinal herb inside
their Sector called cyper.

07:32.482 --> 07:35.400
Can it cure conspiracy theorists?

07:35.402 --> 07:36.784
I'm just saying.

07:36.786 --> 07:39.537
Maybe you could get chummy
with one of the Atrians.

07:39.539 --> 07:40.755
Get a batch.

07:40.757 --> 07:41.939
Fix up this whole hospital.

07:41.941 --> 07:43.157
What did I say?

07:43.159 --> 07:44.892
Keep these guys back.

07:44.894 --> 07:46.411
Oh, my God, it's your dad.

07:46.413 --> 07:48.179
As you can see, Commander Ray Whitehill

07:48.181 --> 07:50.298
of the Sector Enforcement
Unit scans the wristbands

07:50.300 --> 07:51.649
of the Atrian Seven,

07:51.651 --> 07:54.218
allowing authorities
to track their location

07:54.220 --> 07:55.637
while at school.

07:55.639 --> 07:56.954
He's so lucky. He's, like,

07:56.956 --> 07:58.723
one of the few people who can actually say

07:58.725 --> 08:00.591
that they've been inside the Sector.

08:00.593 --> 08:03.478
Of course only you would
consider that lucky.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.463
So, you nervous about today?

08:05.465 --> 08:07.849
Yeah. Sure.

08:07.851 --> 08:09.717
I mean, the guy on the news

08:09.719 --> 08:12.270
last night was saying
how the eyes of the world

08:12.272 --> 08:14.405
would be on Marshall High. Leave it to you

08:14.407 --> 08:16.774
to start your first day back
at school after four years

08:16.776 --> 08:18.576
in front of the eyes of the world.

08:18.578 --> 08:20.662
governments are putting
pressure on our government.

08:20.664 --> 08:22.480
The media hasn't covered
it thoroughly enough...

08:22.482 --> 08:24.916
I'm really glad you got better, Em.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.169
Thanks.

08:28.171 --> 08:30.821
Now it's your turn.

08:30.823 --> 08:33.374
The Atrian Seven are now
headed to Marshall High,

08:33.376 --> 08:36.494
where protests continue to grow.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.784
I speak for all

08:38.785 --> 08:41.120
my colleagues in D.C. when
I say that after three years

08:41.121 --> 08:42.722
of ongoing discussion,
we're very proud to see

08:42.724 --> 08:44.790
this program finally come to fruition.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.759
A program which, if successful,

08:46.761 --> 08:49.962
could lead to the integration
of all Atrians into society.

08:49.964 --> 08:53.232
The hope is that we're not
just able to peacefully coexist,

08:53.234 --> 08:55.485
but we also learn from one another.

08:55.487 --> 08:57.303
Their culture alone...

08:57.305 --> 08:59.355
Those Tatties belong with their own kind!

08:59.357 --> 09:01.024
Our kids were raised right.

09:01.026 --> 09:03.776
Get off of me. Get off of me!

09:03.778 --> 09:05.028
Tatties, go home!

09:05.030 --> 09:08.031
Come on, let's go around back.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.618
In the tech lab are code monkeys.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.253
It's kind of like this weird world

09:14.255 --> 09:16.456
dominated by chimps and
orangutans or whatever...

09:16.458 --> 09:18.424
has no idea how to communicate with humans.

09:18.426 --> 09:20.293
And if you look discreetly

09:20.295 --> 09:22.128
to your two o'clock: Asian fashionistas.

09:22.130 --> 09:24.263
They never wear the same thing twice.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.100
And further up the stairs, to your
two o'clock: on the second landing,

09:27.102 --> 09:28.384
are the Lenin worshipers.

09:28.386 --> 09:29.519
The Communist Lenin,

09:29.521 --> 09:30.970
not the Beatle.

09:30.972 --> 09:32.505
What's your first class? English lit?

09:32.507 --> 09:34.006
I hope you didn't get Mr. Turk.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.775
I mean, he'll make you read Atlas Shrugged.

09:35.777 --> 09:36.943
And let's just say

09:36.945 --> 09:38.611
that it is a total, utter downer.

09:38.613 --> 09:40.513
It's a downer, Em,

09:40.515 --> 09:42.982
and I'm so sure that you're
not even listening to me.

09:42.984 --> 09:45.684
Em! Yes, I'm listening.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.453
You said it's a total and utter downer.

09:47.455 --> 09:48.454
Hey. They're here.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.220
Get out of here!

10:04.222 --> 10:06.539
Go home!

10:06.541 --> 10:09.192
Go home! Go home!

10:11.762 --> 10:13.379
Everybody off.

10:13.381 --> 10:15.264
Everybody off.

10:28.912 --> 10:30.947
All right, follow me.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.377
Let's go. Move it.

10:44.379 --> 10:46.963
Line it up, single file, shoulder width.

10:46.965 --> 10:48.464
I want a line right here.

10:48.466 --> 10:49.515
Line it up.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.083
Form a line.

10:51.085 --> 10:53.186
Right here along. You.

10:53.188 --> 10:54.804
Right here.

11:18.996 --> 11:21.831
I mean, could this day
possibly get any more insane?

11:21.833 --> 11:23.666
I think it just did.

11:23.668 --> 11:26.552
All clear. Let's go.

11:26.554 --> 11:28.137
Move it.

11:36.457 --> 11:38.091
My name is Gloria.

11:38.093 --> 11:40.343
You don't know me, but
I am well-acquainted

11:40.345 --> 11:42.061
with each of you.

11:42.063 --> 11:44.180
Yen ikedÃºr almatÃ©v ayÃ¡?

11:44.182 --> 11:45.848
Yes, Teri, I have been laid recently.

11:45.850 --> 11:48.067
And English is the language of choice

11:48.069 --> 11:50.236
here at Marshall High.

11:50.238 --> 11:52.388
I know you've been briefed on protocol

11:52.390 --> 11:54.407
and passed your MHS entrance exams,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.726
but I think it's necessary
to set some ground rules

11:56.728 --> 11:58.327
for your own safety.

11:58.329 --> 11:59.862
I'm sure you've noticed increased security.

11:59.864 --> 12:01.581
We don't anticipate any violence,

12:01.583 --> 12:03.950
but the guards are here
for your protection.

12:03.952 --> 12:05.585
And the Atrians.

12:05.587 --> 12:07.170
The guards have been authorized
to use their temblor guns

12:07.172 --> 12:08.738
if you step out of line.

12:08.740 --> 12:12.091
You are only permitted to
leave the Sector for school.

12:12.093 --> 12:13.576
Curfew still stands. Back in your pods

12:13.578 --> 12:15.795
by 10:00 p.m. every night.

12:15.797 --> 12:18.131
Behind the walls of this
school, they're just like you.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.432
They're students.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.717
You're test subjects.

12:20.719 --> 12:23.052
At least for the time being.

12:23.054 --> 12:24.554
But one day, you could be graduating.

12:24.556 --> 12:27.223
Heading off to college
or out in the work force.

12:27.225 --> 12:30.059
Imagine the possibilities
if this program is a success.

12:30.111 --> 12:32.662
But it won't be easy. A lot
of people are hoping you fail.

12:32.664 --> 12:36.482
They think your race has
come here to destroy us.

12:36.484 --> 12:39.168
It's up to you to prove them wrong.

12:47.044 --> 12:49.495
Wish we were the kind of
aliens who carried ray guns.

12:49.497 --> 12:51.464
Remember our first day
at the Sector School?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.332
You guys hated it there, too.

12:53.334 --> 12:54.667
At least we didn't have to worry

12:54.669 --> 12:56.335
about temblor guns pointed at our heads.

12:56.337 --> 12:58.604
Or worse. Glee club.

13:00.140 --> 13:02.391
They tagged our lockers.

13:13.987 --> 13:16.072
Right.

13:16.074 --> 13:18.658
You got to use your right hand.

13:20.211 --> 13:21.878
Yes.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.330
I swear I'm not usually
this technologically inept.

13:24.332 --> 13:25.665
It's okay.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.251
You get a pass on your first day.

13:28.253 --> 13:29.535
Where you transferring from?

13:29.537 --> 13:31.203
Oh, nowhere.

13:31.205 --> 13:32.922
I've just been out.

13:32.924 --> 13:35.842
For the last four years.

13:35.844 --> 13:37.426
I transferred last year from Newhall.

13:37.428 --> 13:39.879
And I'm not on the welcoming
committee or anything,

13:39.881 --> 13:42.348
but I know my way around,
so if you need anything...

13:42.350 --> 13:43.766
Thanks.

13:43.768 --> 13:45.050
For the finger tip.

13:45.052 --> 13:48.554
I mean, for the tip for the locker.

13:48.556 --> 13:51.440
See you. Bye.

13:55.452 --> 13:58.136
I never thought I'd say this,

13:58.138 --> 14:00.455
but I'm already starting
to miss our Sector School.

14:00.457 --> 14:03.959
Humans are savages, Roman,
every single one of them.

14:03.961 --> 14:06.144
Right?

14:07.230 --> 14:09.631
Yeah. Right.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.819
I pledge allegiance to the flag

14:13.821 --> 14:15.804
of the United of America,

14:15.806 --> 14:18.523
and to the republic, for which it stands,

14:18.525 --> 14:23.362
one nation, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.865
All right.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.617
I'll be passing out your
syllabus for the semester.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.202
Take one and pass it back.

14:30.204 --> 14:33.005
Hey. Rumor is they have three penises.

14:33.007 --> 14:36.324
Small, medium and extra large.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.545
Yep. Taylor. Sweet girl, braces.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.047
Remember in middle school?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.016
Yeah, now she's in charge.

14:44.018 --> 14:45.500
In charge of what?

14:45.502 --> 14:46.685
All of it.

14:46.687 --> 14:48.804
Hey, have you heard

14:48.806 --> 14:51.640
of an herb the Atrians
supposedly grow in the Sector?

14:51.642 --> 14:53.892
Something called "cyper"?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.227
It's, like, some miracle herb.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.396
Cyper? No.

14:57.398 --> 14:59.014
But if it's herbs you seek,

14:59.016 --> 15:01.350
some of the stoners probably
have some in their lockers.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.706
You eat our food, wear our clothes,

15:07.708 --> 15:09.524
breathe our air, but you can't

15:09.526 --> 15:11.209
be bothered to pledge our flag?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.360
We're not citizens.

15:12.362 --> 15:13.412
Oh, that's right.

15:13.414 --> 15:14.379
You're Martians.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.798
Well, technically, Martians

15:16.800 --> 15:18.383
are from Mars.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.335
We're from a far superior planet.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.520
What did you say to me, freak?

15:21.522 --> 15:23.705
Hey, that's enough!

15:23.707 --> 15:26.758
Atrians are not required
to pledge to the flag.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.377
Cheer up.

15:28.379 --> 15:30.712
You get to keep liberty
and justice all to yourself.

15:30.714 --> 15:32.714
Open up the fall semester calendar.

15:32.716 --> 15:34.683
We have some events coming up.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.519
Nox, you've been the Atrians'

15:37.521 --> 15:39.538
most vocal advocate for equal rights.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.573
Did you think this day would ever come?

15:41.575 --> 15:43.308
I never lost that hope.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.695
This program is the first
step toward unifying our races.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.897
And I couldn't be prouder

15:48.899 --> 15:51.733
that my own children are
part of history in the making.

15:51.735 --> 15:54.036
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

15:54.038 --> 15:55.954
It's the Atrian Seven! Let's go!

16:03.429 --> 16:05.764
Hey. How did it go?

16:05.766 --> 16:08.100
Excellent. We've been far too
insulated in the Sector from

16:08.102 --> 16:10.435
just how kind and compassionate
these people can be.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.253
Your brother has mastered the earthly art

16:12.255 --> 16:14.422
of sarcasm with relative ease.

16:14.424 --> 16:16.641
Tell me about it. If I have
any chance of making friends,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.026
I'm gonna have to distance myself from him.

16:18.028 --> 16:20.195
Why do you want to be friends with them?

16:20.197 --> 16:21.730
Humans are so much more colorful.

16:21.732 --> 16:24.449
I'm sorry. What about today was colorful?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.434
Was it the armed guards or the protestors?

16:26.436 --> 16:29.104
Or...? Oh, wait. I know.
The human kids that hate us.

16:29.106 --> 16:30.655
They just don't know us yet.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.157
- IsÃ­ ipnÃ­ kidÃ³n, ijÃ©n...
- Maia.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.543
English.

16:34.545 --> 16:36.878
You're there to learn, not to make friends.

16:39.716 --> 16:41.633
Well, tomorrow's a new day.

17:00.313 --> 17:02.764
"Your daughter will tell you exactly why

17:02.766 --> 17:05.317
she's not devouring that shrimp lo mein."

17:07.404 --> 17:09.104
It's nothing.

17:12.641 --> 17:15.359
I just... was thinking a lot

17:15.362 --> 17:17.112
about that boy in the shed today.

17:17.114 --> 17:18.747
What about him?

17:18.749 --> 17:22.401
About how, if he hadn't
tried to protect me,

17:22.403 --> 17:24.152
he'd still be alive.

17:28.191 --> 17:30.509
Not everyone can be saved, baby.

17:30.511 --> 17:34.262
Sometimes... there's
a greater plan at work.

17:37.884 --> 17:40.085
Enjoy your meal.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.756
Good afternoon, Atrian.

17:44.758 --> 17:48.026
Your lunch option is puffed rice cake.

17:48.028 --> 17:51.196
Would you like
chicken-flavored, beef or carrot?

17:53.032 --> 17:55.200
Enjoy your meal.

18:00.123 --> 18:01.656
Hey.

18:01.658 --> 18:04.493
It's Emery, right?

18:04.495 --> 18:05.827
- You live over on Woodglen?
- Yeah.

18:05.829 --> 18:08.547
Let me see your phone.

18:10.084 --> 18:12.084
There's a party at this
abandoned farmhouse.

18:12.086 --> 18:13.201
You should come.

18:13.203 --> 18:15.537
Can I bring Lukas?

18:15.539 --> 18:19.424
Sure, yeah, if you guys
are, like, a package deal.

18:19.426 --> 18:21.927
- We're friends.
- Oh, good.

18:21.929 --> 18:24.712
Because Grayson wasn't sure.

18:24.714 --> 18:28.984
Grayson... was... asking?

18:36.559 --> 18:39.111
I am relieving you of duties.

18:39.113 --> 18:42.564
Yes, yes, and you are just in time.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.783
So, what did that fembot want?

18:45.901 --> 18:47.786
How did you manage this, Em?

18:47.788 --> 18:50.255
She invited me. Or us.

18:50.257 --> 18:52.958
I think she's got a crush on you, Luke.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.409
That's cute, Em. That was real cute.

18:54.411 --> 18:56.928
Was that your material? Great.

18:59.081 --> 19:01.349
Okay.

19:03.719 --> 19:06.354
This is your club?

19:06.356 --> 19:08.106
Yeah.

19:08.108 --> 19:09.924
You go to local hospitals,

19:09.926 --> 19:13.094
spend time with patients,
painting, scrapbooking,

19:13.096 --> 19:15.430
that sort of thing.

19:17.933 --> 19:20.986
I found it really comforting.

19:20.988 --> 19:22.704
You were in the club last year?

19:22.706 --> 19:26.441
No. I was a patient.

19:26.443 --> 19:28.627
I spent the last four years in the hospital

19:28.629 --> 19:30.278
because of an immune deficiency.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.946
Hmm.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.585
So, what did you prefer?

19:36.587 --> 19:38.053
The painting or the scrapbooking?

19:38.055 --> 19:40.505
Uh... the scrapbooking.

19:40.507 --> 19:42.140
Oh.

19:49.965 --> 19:52.734
So anyone can join?

19:52.736 --> 19:57.189
Uh... it's a lot of after-school hours,

19:57.191 --> 19:58.773
and with your curfew

19:58.775 --> 20:00.909
and not being permitted
outside the Sector...

20:00.911 --> 20:03.528
- I mean, your Sector without permission, I...
- No, I understand. I understand.

20:03.530 --> 20:06.998
My memories are stored on
a separate computer anyway,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.816
so I probably wouldn't
be good at scrapbooking.

20:10.152 --> 20:11.920
Joking.

20:13.373 --> 20:16.258
Thanks anyway.

20:23.999 --> 20:26.851
You like talking to
our girls there, Tattie?

20:26.853 --> 20:28.970
You think they're pretty?

20:28.972 --> 20:31.673
I was interested in joining her
club, but she wouldn't have me.

20:31.675 --> 20:32.857
Oh, well.

20:32.859 --> 20:34.142
No, don't feel bad.

20:34.144 --> 20:37.112
It's just as well. I don't have
an artistic bone in my body.

20:37.114 --> 20:38.480
Do you have any bones in your body?

20:38.482 --> 20:39.731
Good point.

20:39.733 --> 20:41.650
Our, uh, skeletal system is made up

20:41.652 --> 20:44.953
of 10,000 centipedes holding
hands, but that's Atrian secret

20:44.955 --> 20:47.689
number 145. How do you know that?

20:47.691 --> 20:50.191
- Everything okay, Roman?
- Yeah.

20:50.193 --> 20:51.876
We're just getting to know each other.

20:51.878 --> 20:53.578
I don't care that your dad is

20:53.580 --> 20:55.029
some big Atrian honcho.

20:55.031 --> 20:56.748
You play by our rules here.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.166
Got it, freak?

20:58.168 --> 20:59.884
- Come on...
- Teri.

21:02.805 --> 21:04.706
Got it.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.263
So, wait, they were pissed

21:11.265 --> 21:13.748
because you talked to an Atrian?

21:13.750 --> 21:16.884
I mean, I guess it sort of
is everyone's worst nightmare.

21:16.886 --> 21:18.219
What is?

21:18.221 --> 21:20.655
The notion of the human-Atrian hookup.

21:20.657 --> 21:22.657
A "hookup." Okay, we were talking

21:22.659 --> 21:24.892
about painting and scrapbooking.

21:24.894 --> 21:26.244
That's how it begins.

21:26.246 --> 21:28.997
I think we need to find you a new hobby,

21:28.999 --> 21:31.116
like glassblowing, maybe belly dancing.

21:31.118 --> 21:32.784
Something like...

21:38.341 --> 21:40.458
What are these?

21:42.428 --> 21:44.429
Discharge forms.

21:44.431 --> 21:47.415
You're going home?

21:47.417 --> 21:48.817
For good?

21:48.819 --> 21:51.186
Yeah.

21:51.188 --> 21:53.138
Tuesday.

21:53.140 --> 21:56.141
A... ad you didn't tell me?

21:58.111 --> 21:59.811
Em...

21:59.813 --> 22:01.763
the chemo isn't working.

22:01.765 --> 22:05.984
And finding a bone marrow
match could take years.

22:06.935 --> 22:09.287
So, then why are you going home?

22:09.289 --> 22:10.705
I'm anemic.

22:10.707 --> 22:12.791
I'm getting pneumonia every other week.

22:12.793 --> 22:14.693
My platelet count keeps dropping.

22:14.745 --> 22:16.144
Jules, you're not giving up.

22:16.146 --> 22:17.712
It's not about giving up.

22:17.714 --> 22:19.564
I don't even care about the poking

22:19.566 --> 22:21.616
and the prodding and the puking.

22:21.618 --> 22:23.702
What I can't take anymore

22:23.704 --> 22:26.504
is seeing my parents get their hopes up...

22:26.506 --> 22:28.290
only to have them dashed

22:28.292 --> 22:31.409
one lousy CBC test after another.

22:36.515 --> 22:38.550
They'll let you out for an hour, right?

22:38.552 --> 22:41.753
Why? Where are we going?

22:59.271 --> 23:02.374
And you're sure you know what
this cyper herb looks like?

23:02.376 --> 23:04.409
- Yes.
- Good.

23:04.411 --> 23:07.278
'Cause my dad will kill me
for stealing his access badge.

24:08.148 --> 24:10.900
Yen hembikil.

24:10.902 --> 24:13.102
Yen hembikil!

24:14.104 --> 24:16.889
Ah. Bracelets?

24:16.891 --> 24:18.941
- Okay. I'll take three.
- Oh, no, thank you.

24:18.943 --> 24:20.392
Julia, no. No, thank you.

24:20.394 --> 24:24.113
What do we have here?

24:24.115 --> 24:28.117
You kids know you're
not supposed to be here.

24:29.586 --> 24:31.621
Do you have any cyper?

24:31.623 --> 24:34.257
Cyper.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.343
Right here.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.711
Come on.

24:38.713 --> 24:40.746
IpÃ©n asoryunÃº halÃ¡.

24:50.391 --> 24:52.391
Lockdown! YaprasivÃ­l!

24:52.393 --> 24:56.228
This Sector is now under lockdown!

24:56.230 --> 24:57.613
Come on, come on, come on!

24:57.615 --> 24:58.814
Let's go. Okay.

24:58.816 --> 25:01.784
Lockdown!

25:02.753 --> 25:04.770
We'll be safe up here.

25:04.772 --> 25:08.091
- Jules, you okay?
- Are you kidding?

25:08.193 --> 25:09.426
That was amazing.

25:09.828 --> 25:11.277
What are you guys doing here?

25:11.279 --> 25:14.164
Uh... we came for your cyper.

25:16.551 --> 25:18.785
Well, why didn't you just say so?

25:18.787 --> 25:22.122
I guess its curative powers
are no longer just our secret.

25:23.808 --> 25:25.926
Come on.

25:25.928 --> 25:28.812
We smuggled some seeds into
the Sector from our ship.

25:28.814 --> 25:31.098
- What is this place?
- My dad and I built it.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.066
It's kind of like our
own private sanctuary.

25:33.068 --> 25:35.468
Here it is.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.187
Wow.

25:39.574 --> 25:42.409
Wow, there's so much of it!

25:42.411 --> 25:44.277
Take as much as you'd like.

25:44.279 --> 25:45.879
Is this really cyper?

25:45.881 --> 25:47.447
Yep.

25:47.449 --> 25:49.916
It's really cyper.

25:49.918 --> 25:51.818
Or, as you call it,

25:51.820 --> 25:53.170
saffron.

25:53.172 --> 25:56.757
- Saffron?
- Well, it's our own version of it.

25:56.759 --> 25:58.959
We use it for cooking.

25:58.961 --> 26:01.461
But some enterprising guards
have made a good amount of cash

26:01.463 --> 26:04.164
selling our spice's magic remedy to...

26:04.166 --> 26:06.883
gullible humans outside the Sector.

26:08.586 --> 26:10.503
It was worth a shot.

26:11.723 --> 26:15.142
Do you... have a sick friend?

26:15.144 --> 26:17.177
Um, I don't.

26:17.179 --> 26:19.179
She does.

26:23.961 --> 26:25.745
Um, I'm sorry.

26:27.265 --> 26:29.216
Hey, this wasn't a total loss.

26:29.218 --> 26:31.435
At least I got to see this place.

26:31.437 --> 26:34.137
I'm... obsessed with all things Atrian.

26:36.358 --> 26:37.774
You're shivering. Here.

26:41.112 --> 26:42.145
Thanks.

26:42.147 --> 26:43.596
So chivalrous.

26:45.082 --> 26:47.334
Wow.

26:47.336 --> 26:50.536
City looks beautiful from up here.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.760
How did you get that scar?

26:55.446 --> 26:59.165
It... it happened a long time ago.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.384
On Arrival Day.

27:03.220 --> 27:08.291
That was you i... in the shed, wasn't it?

27:09.626 --> 27:11.928
You knew this whole time.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.514
How?

27:14.516 --> 27:17.317
The moment I saw you at school,

27:17.319 --> 27:21.271
I had this... bizarre
craving for cold spaghetti.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.973
But I was sure you were dead.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.109
I saw them carry you away.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.161
I came close.

27:28.163 --> 27:31.147
One of my hearts actually
stopped beating for a few minutes.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.817
Luckily, I have a backup.

27:37.821 --> 27:42.008
I never got to thank
you... for saving my life.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.961
I... I was six.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.963
I hardly did anything.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.832
You were kind... when
everyone else was cruel.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.518
That's something.

27:54.689 --> 27:56.639
Curfew warning...

27:56.641 --> 27:58.892
Curfew starts in ten
minutes; you guys should go.

27:58.894 --> 28:02.011
Curfew warning: ten...

28:02.013 --> 28:05.115
I can't believe that was
him, the boy from the shed.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.701
But, clearly, he's no longer just a boy.

28:07.703 --> 28:10.236
Julia...

28:11.706 --> 28:14.541
I'm sorry.

28:21.999 --> 28:25.168
Come on, you got to have a
boyfriend back in the Sector, right?

28:25.170 --> 28:26.419
No. There's nobody.

28:26.421 --> 28:29.172
Who knew an Atrian could be so sexy?

28:29.174 --> 28:30.974
You're the talk of the school.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.892
Oh, but don't tell your
friend Teri, though,

28:32.894 --> 28:34.710
'cause we think she might bite.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.064
I should get to class.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.649
Where you going? Where you going?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.717
Hey, tell me something,
is it true what they say

28:41.719 --> 28:43.870
- about Tatties? Oh...
- Don't!

28:43.872 --> 28:45.572
Well, you're kind of a
feisty one, aren't you?

28:45.574 --> 28:47.323
- Stop it!
- Hey! Hey!

28:47.325 --> 28:49.075
Leave her alone.

28:52.780 --> 28:55.731
You just can't seem to
get out of my way, can you?

28:55.733 --> 28:56.916
That's my sister.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.902
Okay.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.871
Roman!

29:03.592 --> 29:05.341
Roman!

29:05.343 --> 29:06.593
- Help!
- Get off him!

29:06.595 --> 29:07.761
Hey, get off him!

29:07.763 --> 29:08.928
Somebody help him!

29:11.433 --> 29:14.851
Hey! Hey, break it up. Break it up.

29:14.853 --> 29:17.086
Get out of here!

29:17.088 --> 29:19.755
Go back to your own damn planet!

29:19.757 --> 29:21.791
Hey, get him the hell out of here!

29:21.793 --> 29:23.943
Write him up. Let's go.

29:41.894 --> 29:44.745
I've been watching you
for a long time, Roman.

29:44.747 --> 29:46.463
I worked closely with your father

29:46.465 --> 29:48.265
to help build this program.

29:48.267 --> 29:49.800
Unless you want to see it fail,

29:49.802 --> 29:51.602
you have to stop acting like an animal.

29:51.604 --> 29:53.721
He assaulted my sister,

29:53.723 --> 29:55.622
and I'm the animal? This happens again,

29:55.624 --> 29:58.392
they'll hand you over to
military doctors to have

29:58.394 --> 30:00.311
your testicles put in a jar and studied.

30:00.313 --> 30:01.428
You don't want that.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.714
I don't want that.

30:03.716 --> 30:06.283
And my testicles
definitely don't want that.

30:07.452 --> 30:09.936
I always protect my investments.

30:11.939 --> 30:15.275
That is, until they lose their viability.

30:26.388 --> 30:28.222
Roman.

30:32.227 --> 30:34.294
Hey.

30:34.296 --> 30:36.597
You're coming tonight, right?

30:36.599 --> 30:38.982
Yes, Grayson, you're gonna see her tonight.

30:38.984 --> 30:40.567
God. Attempt to be cool.

30:40.569 --> 30:43.470
Even social newbies like Emery

30:43.472 --> 30:46.240
still like a little cool with their drool.

30:49.244 --> 30:51.412
Uh...

30:58.703 --> 31:01.505
Quadrant C cleared for inspection.

31:01.507 --> 31:03.173
Stay out of it, Teri.

31:03.175 --> 31:05.459
Even if you can get out
to crash their lame party,

31:05.461 --> 31:07.511
you'll never get back
in time to make curfew.

31:07.513 --> 31:08.829
Maybe, maybe not.

31:08.831 --> 31:10.664
But we need to send a message, all right?

31:10.666 --> 31:12.933
What happened to Roman
today can never happen again.

31:16.671 --> 31:18.555
High heels now?

31:18.557 --> 31:20.858
It's the beginning of the end.

31:20.860 --> 31:23.009
No, it's a party.

31:24.015 --> 31:26.583
You'll be careful?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.218
Always.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.137
Have fun.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.438
You deserve it.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.141
I'm out of here. Off to the Sector.

31:34.143 --> 31:36.109
Bye, Dad!

31:47.505 --> 31:49.456
Do you ever miss it?

31:49.458 --> 31:51.291
What?

31:51.293 --> 31:54.161
Atria? Of course.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.046
Every day.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.432
But...

31:58.434 --> 32:01.217
this is our home now.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.622
Armed guards, mandatory
curfew and barbed wire.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.991
It's not exactly my idea of home.

32:07.993 --> 32:09.693
It won't be like that forever.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.283
Dad, they're...

32:11.285 --> 32:13.035
they're never gonna treat us like equals.

32:13.037 --> 32:15.487
You know, your generation
can bridge the gap.

32:15.489 --> 32:17.205
A gap they created.

32:17.207 --> 32:20.409
I... I'm not saying it's
gonna happen tomorrow.

32:20.411 --> 32:22.344
These things take time.

32:22.346 --> 32:24.930
But I have faith in them.

32:27.166 --> 32:29.868
Just like I have faith in you.

32:31.304 --> 32:33.538
You're not like the rest.

32:34.457 --> 32:37.559
I just don't see it.

32:42.949 --> 32:46.718
We'll finish this planting tomorrow.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.243
What do you want, Teri?

32:55.245 --> 32:56.728
I saw you last night

32:56.730 --> 32:59.281
with that girl Emery.

33:00.566 --> 33:03.201
I was keeping her out of trouble.

33:03.203 --> 33:06.588
I don't know why you even bother
making connections with them.

33:06.590 --> 33:08.523
Soon, they're gonna be the
ones behind these walls.

33:08.525 --> 33:10.008
What are you talking about?

33:10.010 --> 33:11.843
Just something my mother

33:11.845 --> 33:14.212
and the rest of the Trags talk
about in their Monday meeting.

33:14.214 --> 33:16.581
No offense, Teri, but
your mother's an idiot.

33:17.884 --> 33:20.352
Oh, and by the way,

33:20.354 --> 33:23.972
Drake and them went after that kid Eric.

33:26.425 --> 33:30.095
Lockdown, 2200 hours.

33:30.097 --> 33:32.597
Lockdown, 2200 hours.

33:36.402 --> 33:40.372
I'm looking for the path to Hades.

33:40.374 --> 33:42.824
Aren't you Nox's son?

33:47.630 --> 33:49.915
You must be confused.

33:49.917 --> 33:51.833
Can you help?

33:59.677 --> 34:02.761
As I told your friends,
you've got three hours

34:02.763 --> 34:04.179
before the signal reactivates.

34:04.181 --> 34:07.899
Zone B. Corridor 8.

34:07.901 --> 34:10.235
Look for the broken light.

34:10.237 --> 34:13.237
Directly beneath, there's a false panel.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.601
Okay.

34:42.603 --> 34:44.719
I had to strong-arm a
freshman to get the last

34:44.722 --> 34:46.138
of the blue punch.

34:46.139 --> 34:47.355
Thanks.

34:47.357 --> 34:48.672
Cheers.

34:48.675 --> 34:51.560
Cheers.

34:51.562 --> 34:52.811
You all right?

34:52.813 --> 34:55.147
Yeah. Sure.

34:55.149 --> 34:56.982
You just seem a little distracted.

34:58.368 --> 35:00.235
This is all just...

35:00.237 --> 35:01.870
pretty new to me.

35:01.872 --> 35:04.156
Just try to relax. You're not being judged.

35:04.158 --> 35:05.874
Most people here are
too self-obsessed to care

35:05.876 --> 35:07.459
about anyone else.

35:08.795 --> 35:10.162
Hey!

35:10.164 --> 35:12.363
You guys got to see this!

35:17.221 --> 35:19.871
Look what someone did to Brock!

35:21.891 --> 35:23.391
Who did this?

35:23.393 --> 35:25.010
Huh?!

35:25.012 --> 35:26.645
Who did this?!

35:26.647 --> 35:29.214
We just want to have a little talk.

35:29.216 --> 35:31.716
All right.

35:31.718 --> 35:33.235
This ends tonight.

35:34.070 --> 35:37.239
For once, we agree.

35:37.241 --> 35:39.074
Hey!

35:40.444 --> 35:41.893
We're sick of it!

35:41.895 --> 35:44.863
You guys messing with us every day!

35:44.865 --> 35:47.232
It's done! It's over!
This is what's gonna happen

35:47.234 --> 35:49.167
if you keep messing with us, you hear me?!

35:49.169 --> 35:51.002
Hey! Come on!

35:51.004 --> 35:52.671
Roman, what are you doing
here? Do you know what they'd

35:52.673 --> 35:54.673
do to you if they found
you outside the Sector?

35:54.675 --> 35:55.907
You should be fighting alongside of me

35:55.909 --> 35:57.092
instead of against me!

35:57.094 --> 35:58.126
Cops!

35:58.128 --> 35:59.127
Come on!

36:02.432 --> 36:06.251
Roman. Roman! Ro...!

36:09.421 --> 36:11.473
- Are you okay?
- Emery, come on!

36:11.475 --> 36:13.591
Come on! Roman, get in!

36:13.593 --> 36:15.831
Are you nuts? Come on,
Emery, just leave him!

36:15.833 --> 36:17.082
But what about the cops?!

36:17.084 --> 36:18.550
His problem, not ours! Come on!

36:18.552 --> 36:20.252
Emery, what are you doing? Let's go!

36:20.254 --> 36:22.638
Emery! Grayson, we got to go right now.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.556
Roman, come on. We'll be faster on foot.

36:24.558 --> 36:25.807
- We can't just leave her!
- Yes, we can, man!

36:25.809 --> 36:26.892
She's a total freak!

36:26.894 --> 36:29.928
Dude, she chose the
Tattie over you. Own it.

36:29.930 --> 36:31.563
Come on! Let's go!

36:54.101 --> 36:55.852
Are you okay?

36:55.854 --> 36:59.322
Other than having possibly
just committed social suicide?

36:59.324 --> 37:00.991
Sure.

37:02.527 --> 37:05.712
You okay?

37:08.066 --> 37:09.536
You know, it's funny.

37:09.541 --> 37:11.441
All these years, my dad has taught me

37:11.443 --> 37:14.261
about this vaunted thing called "humanity,"

37:14.263 --> 37:16.546
something that, by definition,

37:16.548 --> 37:18.498
we could never possess.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.284
But...

37:21.286 --> 37:26.139
after spending just a few
days amongst your kind...

37:26.141 --> 37:28.859
this concept of "humanity"
doesn't seem so clear to me.

37:28.861 --> 37:32.229
No. There are a lot of
good people out there.

37:32.231 --> 37:33.764
Yeah?

37:33.766 --> 37:36.700
Well, I've only met one.

37:58.573 --> 38:00.874
You don't have to be afraid.

38:11.403 --> 38:12.853
Sorry.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.354
It's my mom.

38:14.356 --> 38:16.106
Hey.

38:16.108 --> 38:17.724
I'll be home soon.

38:21.996 --> 38:24.831
O... okay. I'm on my way.

38:24.833 --> 38:28.401
It's... Julia.

38:28.403 --> 38:30.670
I have to go.

38:31.539 --> 38:32.640
I understand.

38:32.652 --> 38:33.507
If you keep walking straight,

38:33.509 --> 38:35.792
you'll find the road to the Sector.

38:35.794 --> 38:37.677
Thanks.

38:37.679 --> 38:39.096
Hey.

38:41.265 --> 38:42.432
Are you okay?

38:42.434 --> 38:44.601
I have to go.

39:07.492 --> 39:09.409
Teri.

39:09.411 --> 39:10.618
You were with Roman a few hours ago.

39:10.619 --> 39:13.296
Do you know where he
is? It's almost curfew.

39:13.298 --> 39:15.165
Teri?

39:59.827 --> 40:01.761
How could you let my son go out there?

40:12.107 --> 40:13.907
Is there a problem here, gentlemen?

40:13.909 --> 40:15.275
No, we're good.

40:20.565 --> 40:22.949
Step away from the table.
Let me see your hands.

40:27.187 --> 40:29.422
Ooh.

40:29.444 --> 40:30.961
What's that?

40:30.963 --> 40:32.379
Not good, Weeble.

40:39.972 --> 40:41.705
Drop your weapon!

40:45.843 --> 40:46.960
Weeble, no!

41:04.645 --> 41:06.363
Man down!

41:11.302 --> 41:13.870
Commander Whitehill!

41:15.206 --> 41:16.873
Ray!

41:16.875 --> 41:19.176
Are you okay?
