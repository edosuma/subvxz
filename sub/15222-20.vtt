<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.238 --> 00:08.401
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.475 --> 00:09.999
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:14.881 --> 00:19.284
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:21.786
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:26.019
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.260 --> 00:32.197
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.565
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:41.198
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:41.274 --> 00:43.708
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.837
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:48.904
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:55.622 --> 00:57.852
Hyah! Hyah! Hey!

00:58.658 --> 01:00.819
<i>Fire.!</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:06.657

that company over there!

<i>Fire.!</i>

02:47.300 --> 02:49.291
Help me.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.071
I don't feel nothin'.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.733
Yeah, well-
Maybe that's a good thing, son.

02:55.808 --> 02:59.175
Just lie still. How come I don't
feel nothin', Captain Beckett?

02:59.245 --> 03:01.406
- What?
- It's like I got no body, sir.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.245
- How can that be good?
- What'd you call me?

03:04.317 --> 03:07.411
- Did you call me Captain Beckett?
- That's your name, sir.

03:07.487 --> 03:10.388
You've got to get word to my wife.
Please tell my wife.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.117
I'll tell her.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.360
Al!

03:15.428 --> 03:17.555
Oh!

03:17.630 --> 03:19.598
Get those men moving!

03:37.550 --> 03:39.643
<i>- You see him, sir?
- No, we've lost the dog.</i>

<i>Get back to the line.

"To all companies of the army of the
Potomac from General G.B. McClellen.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.375
"September 2, 1862"?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.710
"Upon receipt of these orders,
you, Captain John Beckett-"

04:42.782 --> 04:44.716
John Beckett.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.664
Oh, Sam, you're here!

05:07.740 --> 05:10.072
Gooshie, I got him!
Al.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.237
Sam, we didn't think
we'd ever find you.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.043
It's you. Sam, boy, take it
easy. You don't look so good.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.573
You're telling me, Al. Yeah, I'm telling
you. It's a miracle we found you at all.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.643
Where am I?
Tell me where I am.

05:21.721 --> 05:25.714
You're somewhere in Virginia.
Look at me! Look at this uniform.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.260
You look good in dark blue, Sam.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.526
This is a Union army uniform.
This is a real Civil War uniform.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.829
Yeah, I recognize it, Sam.
And this is a real wound.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.803
How'd you get that?
There was a battle.

05:38.871 --> 05:42.102
A big Civil War battle.

05:43.109 --> 05:48.672
It was horrible. Cannons and-
and horses and men dying and-

05:48.748 --> 05:52.240
And these Confederate soldiers,
they tried to chase me down.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.310
And-And then there was this
black family. Th-They found me.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.050
Take it
- take it easy. Calm down, Sam. Slaves.

05:58.124 --> 06:02.561
Right? Slaves or-or, uh,
runaway slaves.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.096
And they brought me here.
Wherever the hell this is.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.359
What is going on?
Eh, well,

06:07.433 --> 06:10.027
Ziggy was tracking you
right after you leaped.

06:10.103 --> 06:14.062
And then- blooey. You just dropped
right off the space-time continuum-

06:14.140 --> 06:16.574
That's not possible, Al.
You know that.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.633
I can't leap
outside of my own lifetime.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.702
Yeah. But, Sam, uh
- you're here. What?

06:20.780 --> 06:25.513
You're in Virginia,
and it's September 20, 1862.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.879
There was a man-
a kid really-

06:29.956 --> 06:33.050
and he called me
Captain Beckett.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.429
What does Ziggy make out of
that? Uh, coincidence maybe.

06:37.497 --> 06:40.933
It's more than a coincidence. Tell
me about the guy in the waiting room.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.835
He's a young guy. He's like 24 or 25. And he's
scared out of his mind, Sam. He won't say anything.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.772
Did you get his name? His name
is John, but that's all he'll say.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.775
John? John?
John.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.672
John Beckett?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.942
Al, there was
a John Beckett in my family.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.045
And he fought in the Civil War.

07:03.122 --> 07:07.752
He-
He was my great-grandfather.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.022
I'm my great-grandfather?

07:10.096 --> 07:14.192
My great-grandfather fought
with the Union forces in the Civil War.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.101
His name was John Beckett.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.503
My dad was named after him.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.632
<i>Yeah, Captain John Beckett.</i>

07:22.708 --> 07:28.169
That would explain this. It's the only reason I can
figure out why I could leap outside my own lifetime.

07:28.247 --> 07:31.045
It must've been some kind
of genetic transfer or something.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.780
Yeah, something like that. Look. You
go back to the waiting room, okay?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.823
And start a blood profile
on John Beckett, all right?

07:37.890 --> 07:41.826
And then have them compare, uh,
his D.N.A. And my D.N.A.

07:41.894 --> 07:45.352
And-And if it matches, then,

07:45.431 --> 07:49.162
well, at least it's a start to
figuring out the answer to why I'm here.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.999
<i>Who's back there?</i>

07:52.071 --> 07:54.062
You come on out!

07:55.908 --> 07:57.842
<i>I'm coming, ma'am.</i>

07:57.910 --> 08:00.743
- Please don't shoot.
- Come on out here where I can see you.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.043
<i>Come closer.</i>

08:03.115 --> 08:05.845
Where's the other one?

08:05.918 --> 08:09.046
- The other what?
- Whoever you were talking to.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.214
I'm right here, Scarlett.
Ooh, she's lovely.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.588
I always had a thing
for girls from the Deep South.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.752
Isaac. Isaac!

08:15.828 --> 08:20.265
Isaac? You go on in there
and see who he was talking to.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.597
There's no need to do that, ma'am.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.898
I, uh-

08:24.971 --> 08:30.238
I've lost a lot of blood here, and, uh, I'm not
thinking real straight. I was just talking to myself.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.903
I wouldn't trust a word
out of your stinkin' Yankee mouth...

08:32.979 --> 08:35.640
if you told me that peaches
were sweet in the summer.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.443
Ooh.

08:37.517 --> 08:42.181
Look, I just needed a place to rest. That's
all. I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.883
- I'll- I'll just be going-
- You're not going anywhere, bluecoat.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.221
If he was talkin' to anyone,
Miss Livvy, they gone now.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.761
<i>See? L-I wasn't lying to you.</i>

08:49.829 --> 08:53.765
- Maybe they comin' back.
- That was miles away.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.358
<i>Isaac, get the shackles.</i>

08:58.337 --> 09:03.206
- You- - Uh, Sam, this,
uh- This sounds bad.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.211
I think I better go check on
those D.N.A. Samples. Go. Go.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.543
<i>What'd you say?</i>

09:08.614 --> 09:10.912
Go ahead and put me
in shackles if you want to.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.247
But I swear to you,
I'm not gonna try and run.

09:13.319 --> 09:17.255
After your Yankee army ransacked my
home, you expect me to believe you?

09:17.323 --> 09:19.223
- That wasn't me.
- Your kind.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.227
I would never do anything like
that. I am no threat to you.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.924
- So, if you just let me go on my way-
- Don't you budge an inch.

09:25.998 --> 09:29.764
<i>If you think that I can't shoot Just because
I'm a lady, then you got another think coming.</i>

09:29.835 --> 09:33.635
- Now hold still.
- I need your hands, sir.

09:38.377 --> 09:41.938
Never dreamed I'd be
putting these on a white man.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.789
<i>Now I might trust you.
What's your name, Yankee?</i>

09:58.864 --> 10:02.300
Captain John Beckett.
Army of the Potomac.

10:02.368 --> 10:05.496
I think.
And you're Miss Livvy-

10:05.571 --> 10:08.472
<i>That's Mrs. Olivia Barrett Covington
to you.</i>

10:08.541 --> 10:13.035
Well, I suppose under other circumstances
I'd say, pleased to meet you, ma'am.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.307
Outside.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.281
A Yankee soldier,
on my land?

10:24.357 --> 10:29.021
He was fixin' to die, Miss Livvy. You've gone
too far, Isaac. When's the patrol due back?

10:29.095 --> 10:31.427
Between sundown tonight
and noon tomorrow.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.795
What patrol?
Virginia Militia Patrol.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.891
They know what to do
with Yankee dogs.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.495
And what would that be?
The firing squad, if you're lucky.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.506
And if I'm unlucky?

10:41.574 --> 10:44.509
That big magnolia out there
makes a fine gallows.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.638
<i>Clean him up. We want him
to look nice for his hangin;</i>

10:55.855 --> 10:57.846
<i>Okay.
Now hold yourself still.</i>

10:57.923 --> 10:59.891
<i>Do you have to be
so rough?</i>

10:59.959 --> 11:02.587
If I were being rough,
you'd be passin' out about now.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.960
Good thing it went
clean through.

11:05.031 --> 11:08.159
Yeah. Look, there are ways to
clean a bullet wound without-

11:08.234 --> 11:10.964
Don't blame me. I'm not the one
rollin' around in that creek bed.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.200
I got shot, all right?
Too bad it wasn't in your mouth.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.935
What do you expect me to do?
Let the gangrene set in there?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.534
What difference does it make?
You're gonna hang me tomorrow.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.604
All right. That's just fine.
Go ahead and die of blood poisoning.

11:22.682 --> 11:27.949
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. You're doing a good job. L
- Please.

11:32.091 --> 11:36.050
<i>- What is that?
- Haven't you ever seen a mustard poultice before?</i>

11:36.128 --> 11:38.460
Oh, wow.
Yeah. Yeah.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.692
Forget what I said.
Bring on the gangrene.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.825
Honestly, I will never
understand you Yankees.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.302
What?
Dirty, stinkin', foul barbarians.

11:45.371 --> 11:49.273
Now wait a second. Yankees have
- We are people just like you.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.332
People just like me
don't ride in roughshod,

11:51.410 --> 11:54.243
slaughter an entire herd of cattle
that don't belong to them...

11:54.313 --> 11:56.873
or steal most all their chickens
and their corn.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.940
Yeah, well, war is hell.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.621
How dare you say that to me.

12:02.688 --> 12:06.215
It's not your home that's been ravaged.
It's not your husband that's been killed.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.122
I'm sorry. I didn't know-
Never mind.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.428
I manage just fine
all by myself.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.492
I can see that. Good thing you
got Isaac and the others to help.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.937
There are no more "others. " Gone
away a long time ago, all of'em.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.305
But I saw them,
last night by the stream.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.971
Delirium makes a person
see lots of things.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.985
Hold this here. I'll get
something to wrap it up with.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.485
Do I need to have Isaac
keep an eye on you?

12:38.557 --> 12:43.290
No, ma'am.
I'm- I'm not going anywhere.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.169
- Oh, that's a hell of a woman.
- Yeah. Well, hell is one word I would use.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.263
<i>Come on, Sam.
You got to admire her.</i>

12:54.340 --> 12:58.709
Olivia Covington. Married
at 22. Widowed at 24.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.475
That's very nice, Al. Now what
does Ziggy say is going on here?

13:02.548 --> 13:04.482
- Uh-We don't know.
- What?

13:04.550 --> 13:06.882
Oh, but we did
confirm your theory.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.318
Really?
Yeah. Uh, Ziggy says...

13:09.388 --> 13:13.256
it's a genetic field transference.

13:13.325 --> 13:18.592
But the bottom line is that the D.N.A.
OfJohn's blood sample does match yours.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.996
So, congratulations.
You're a great-grandfather.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.035
This is amazing.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.046
<i>I'll tell you what's amazing.</i>

13:35.114 --> 13:40.848
Your great-grandmother's name just
happened to be Olivia Covington Beckett.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.219
- No.
- Yes.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.692
No, no, n
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.662
Your southern belle there is
your sweetie, your bride-to-be...

13:51.730 --> 13:54.665
and your great-grandma all
rolled in one- Ha-ha-ha.

13:54.733 --> 13:58.533
You're enjoying this a little too
much. Yes, I'm enjoying it a lot.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.539
She hates me. Figure out a
way to get her to like you.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.905
She thinks all Yankees
are filthy animals.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.910
I mean, the-

14:05.978 --> 14:09.379
But at least she can't
be the reason I'm here.

14:09.448 --> 14:14.215
She and my Great-grandfatherJohn, they met, they
got married. Everything worked out fine, right?

14:14.286 --> 14:16.277
Right.
Probably.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.587
Fifty-nine percent chance that your mission is
something else. Fifty-nine percent? That's all?

14:20.659 --> 14:24.755
Yeah. While you're trying to figure out what your
mission is, you got to keep the romance on track.

14:24.830 --> 14:28.197
No, no. I'm not gonna keep the
romance going. What romance?

14:28.267 --> 14:31.031
<i>Besides, Al, we're talking about
my great-grandmother here.</i>

14:31.103 --> 14:33.901
- I mean, that would be the same-
- Just my luck.

14:33.973 --> 14:38.103
<i>Not only do I have to nursemaid a
Yankee. I get one who's crazy to boot.</i>

14:38.177 --> 14:40.145
Go get her, Rhett.

14:42.314 --> 14:46.410
- What's that?
- Cannon fire, you dolt.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.612
You're a soldier.
You don't know that?

14:50.689 --> 14:55.251
Well, y-yeah. Of
course I do. But I, uh-

14:55.327 --> 14:58.091
- Miss Livvy, there's a fire in the barn!
- Wait a second.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.655
Let me help.

15:12.811 --> 15:16.406
Here, here.
Give me the bucket. Come on.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.118
Aaah!

15:46.512 --> 15:49.379
Watch that corner, Isaac.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.312
Who is it?
Let me do the talking.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.042
<i>Miss Covington. Sam, there's
Confederate soldiers coming.</i>

16:24.116 --> 16:27.381
<i>You got to hide. You can't let
them see you. Eh, they see you.</i>

16:33.225 --> 16:35.284
<i>Are you all right?</i>

16:37.229 --> 16:39.424
And who might you be?

16:39.498 --> 16:42.865
Him? This is, uh-
Uh-

16:42.935 --> 16:45.199
I'm Olivia's cousin.

16:45.270 --> 16:49.366
Aubrey Covington from Natchez,
Mississippi, at your service.

16:50.609 --> 16:54.272
And this is Lieutenant Richard
Montgomery, from Richmond.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.713
He and his boys are our Home
Guard here in Mansfield County.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.184
Uh, I think you just dodged a
bullet. You can say that again.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.244
- I beg your pardon?
- I said that-

17:03.322 --> 17:06.553
It was a real pleasure
to meet you, sir.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.252
I'm surprised a man your age
is not in uniform, serving the South.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.228
Well, I am.
Uh, oh, yeah, he is.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.762
<i>- You are?
- You're with the-</i>

17:12.830 --> 17:15.356
I'm serving with the-
the Mississippi 6th.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.231
<i>Mississippi 6th- I'm a
captain. Under the command of-</i>

17:17.301 --> 17:20.031
GeneralJohn Adams. Under the
command of GeneralJohn Adams.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.436
Hmm. But they are
clear over in Tennessee.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.532
Yes. Yes, that's true.
You got wounded.

17:24.609 --> 17:29.240
But, uh, you see, I was
wounded here, and, uh-

17:29.314 --> 17:34.616
I was granted a personal leave of
absence by GeneralJohn Adams himself.

17:34.686 --> 17:39.646
And my dear cousin here has
agreed to nurse me back to health.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.751
Well, aren't you a lucky man.
Yes, sir, I am.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.626
- That doesn't look too serious.
- Well, it may not look that way,

17:45.697 --> 17:49.497
but I had a little blood poisoning-
gangrene- set in.

17:49.568 --> 17:55.200
And then some half-wit medic
tried to apply a mustard poultice.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.333
Darn thing nearly killed me.

17:57.409 --> 18:01.243
Well, I'm glad to find you
well and happy, ma'am.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.680
<i>I saw that smoke-
Well, I was concerned.</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:08.584
Well, a shell hit our barn,
and we were just able to save it.

18:08.654 --> 18:12.249
Thanks to Cousin Aubrey.
Oh, it was nothin'.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.884
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

18:14.960 --> 18:17.690
Well, we are on runaway slave
patrol here, ma'am.

18:17.763 --> 18:23.065
But I just wanted to warn you
- There are lots of escaped Yankees on the loose in these parts.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.330
Shot one Yankee dog,
but he got away.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.497
What a shame.

18:27.573 --> 18:31.236
And remember, if you find any runaway
nigras in these parts, you let me know.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.177
- Well, you know I will.
- You take good care, ma'am.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.541
- Captain.
- Lieutenant.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.981
We will continue our patrol,
gentlemen.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.788
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:48.861 --> 18:51.523
Thank you.
Leave me alone.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.656
I can't thank you enough.
Why'd you do it?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.791
I don't know.
You saved my life.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.326
It was a bad idea. Yeah, but
you did it. And I thank you.

18:59.404 --> 19:02.896
<i>You're welcome, Captain. You
must've had some reason though.</i>

19:02.975 --> 19:04.966
You saved my barn.
That's not enough.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.204
You're right.
It's not enough.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.578
I expect you to do a lot of work
around here. I got two busted pumps-

19:10.649 --> 19:14.210
It has something to do with the
slaves, doesn't it? The runaways.

19:14.286 --> 19:19.189
And 400 acres laying fallow, whole pieces
of my house are fallin' off in chunks.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.853
Your Yankee brothers did it.
I expect you to make up for it.

19:22.928 --> 19:26.728
I'll do the best I can. If those blue butchers
come back, I expect you to tell them...

19:26.798 --> 19:29.767
that I spared your life and that
they ought to spare mine and Isaac's.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.601
Oh, my God.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.066
It's okay.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.668
<i>Just-Just take it easy, okay?</i>

20:47.746 --> 20:49.873
Uh, I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.610
You're damn right
you're not.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.092
Put the gun away,
Isaac, okay? It's me.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.152
Why'd you come out here?

21:05.230 --> 21:07.357
I heard the baby crying.
I thought maybe I could-

21:15.173 --> 21:18.472
You people are runaway slaves,
aren't you?

21:18.543 --> 21:22.445
On the Underground Railroad.
You're the conductor.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.039
This is one of the stations, right?

21:26.618 --> 21:29.086
Does Olivia know?
You leave Miss Livvy out of this.

21:29.154 --> 21:32.146
You done caused her
enough trouble already.

21:32.224 --> 21:36.092
Isaac, I can find out
information about-

21:36.161 --> 21:38.755
about the way things
are gonna be in the future.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.821
How's that?

21:40.899 --> 21:42.958
Are you some kind
of voodoo man?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.960
In a way.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.067
There are some things
I could tell you about now.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.579
<i>In a couple of months, President
Lincoln is gonna issue an order...</i>

21:54.646 --> 21:57.080
making all the slaves free.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.310
It's called
the Emancipation Proclamation.

21:59.384 --> 22:03.514
<i>Well, that'd be fine, if we lived
up north. Well, it'll be fine anyway.</i>

22:03.588 --> 22:06.887
Because in about two years,
the North is gonna win this war.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.950
<i>Things are gonna be bad for a while,
but everything is gonna change.</i>

22:10.028 --> 22:14.624
<i>Blacks- Negroes
are gonna get to vote.</i>

22:14.700 --> 22:17.567
They're gonna get jobs-
good jobs.

22:17.636 --> 22:21.834
- That's crazy talk.
- It's truth.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.775
I swear it, Isaac.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.939
It's gonna be a long, hard fight
for schooling and other equality.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.107
<i>But believe me.</i>

22:31.183 --> 22:34.675
<i>There will come a time when
everyone will have the same rights.</i>

22:34.753 --> 22:36.778
Everyone will be free.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.585
That ain't nothin' but a dream.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.718
Believe in it, Isaac.

22:52.437 --> 22:54.428
Good luck to you folks.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.988
That should do it.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.218
Cross your fingers.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.187
Hold on a second-
Just a second.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.324
Come on. Come on.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.995
You know,
you are one useless man.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.904
Yeah, well, you still
have a barn, don't you?

23:28.974 --> 23:31.238
And I am so grateful.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.510
Fine. We'll just-Aaah.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.421
It's rusted solid.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.721
Yeah, it's rusted-

23:48.794 --> 23:51.194
All right. Come on.
Maybe if we do it together.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.130
Here, move over. All right,
ready? Get over there.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.066
One, two, three, push.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.473
Try it again. Ready?
And-

24:02.541 --> 24:05.237
Captain, do you mind?

24:05.310 --> 24:07.335
Sorry.

24:10.382 --> 24:14.113
Look. Just let me try it again. I'll
- I am not some wiltin' flower.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.416
I'm not saying that you are.
Just let me try it.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.252
Anybody who's risking what you're
risking is not gonna wilt easily.

24:19.324 --> 24:21.918
What's that supposed to
mean? Nothing. Nothing.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.984
It's just that-

24:24.062 --> 24:28.499
Do you by any chance know what the penalty
for harboring slaves is in this state?

24:28.567 --> 24:31.035
How should I know? Just thought
you might know, that's all.

24:31.102 --> 24:34.731
I mean, uh,
if I were sheltering slaves,

24:34.806 --> 24:37.468
I'd make damn sure I knew
what the penalty was.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.703
Do you know someone who is?

24:39.778 --> 24:43.043
Maybe. Maybe I managed
to escape Lieutenant Montgomery...

24:43.114 --> 24:45.309
because someone
has certain sympathies,

24:45.383 --> 24:47.817
no matter how much
she complains about the Yankees.

24:47.886 --> 24:51.822
Aren't you just full of riddles. Maybe I got food
and shelter because someone isn't as hateful...

24:51.890 --> 24:53.881
as someone pretends to be.

24:53.959 --> 24:59.090
Maybe I'm gonna punch someone in the
mouth if they don't fix this stupid pump.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.491
Lord, I'm hot.

25:03.568 --> 25:05.627
Yeah, well,
if you went inside,

25:05.704 --> 25:08.400
and got out of that silly-
beautiful dress,

25:08.473 --> 25:11.169
<i>and put on something cool-</i>

25:11.243 --> 25:13.609
Like what? Like, uh, you
know, pants and a shirt.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.238
Oh, you would just love that,
wouldn't you?

25:16.314 --> 25:18.976
Having the neighbors see
Olivia Covington in britches,

25:19.050 --> 25:21.780
like some sort of field hand.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.878
There's nothing wrong
with wearing pants, okay?

25:23.955 --> 25:26.321
In fact, there'll come a time
when respectable women...

25:26.391 --> 25:29.485
will wear pants- britches-
on a daily basis.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.620
Nobody will even think
twice about it. Oh, indeed.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.290
And I suppose they're gonna
smoke tobacco too.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.960
If they want to.
But I wouldn't recommend it.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.697
And drink hard liquor.
They'll even vote.

25:39.771 --> 25:43.707
And they'll stand up for things they
believe in. Like opposing slavery.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.505
She's magnificent.
How long have you been here?

25:52.584 --> 25:55.678
Long enough to see that you're
blowing it. I'm not blowing it, Al.

25:55.754 --> 25:59.622
You're antagonizing her, Sam.
Why are you antagonizing her?

25:59.691 --> 26:03.149
I'm not antagonizing her, Al.
She's antagonizing me.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.789
She keeps getting to me,
you know. I mean-And-And-

26:06.865 --> 26:09.663
I think I know why I'm here.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.567
Why? Isaac is running a stop
on the Underground Railroad.

26:12.637 --> 26:15.731
I must be here to help him. Don't you
think? We don't have any data on Isaac.

26:15.807 --> 26:19.299
But we got data on the people that helped
the slaves in the Underground Railway.

26:19.377 --> 26:24.178
Ziggy says 70% of them were caught
and either imprisoned or executed.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.342
Well, what about Olivia?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.909
I mean, I-I don't think
she's actually helping them.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.581
But she's sort of looking
the other way.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.647
Yeah, but we don't have
any data on her either.

26:33.725 --> 26:38.253
But the Confederate army, they didn't treat
sympathizers any different than they did the slaves.

26:38.330 --> 26:42.528
All right, look. You go back and
get me any data that you can...

26:42.601 --> 26:44.694
that'll be helpful to
the slaves, right? Okay.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.932
Troop movements, uh, weather
reports. Anything like that, okay?

26:48.006 --> 26:50.167
Okay. Okay.
In the meantime,

26:50.241 --> 26:53.677
you better start winning
over Miss Olivia there. Yeah.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.873
Because if you don't, she's not gonna
marry you-John. She's not gonna marryJohn.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.349
And if she doesn't marryJohn,
your parents will never get here.

27:00.418 --> 27:02.613
I'll worry about Olivia, okay?
You just get back there...

27:02.687 --> 27:04.814
and get me that data
so I can give it to the slaves,

27:04.889 --> 27:08.188
so I can get out of here and her
real future husband can come back.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.284
O- Okay.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.167
Oh.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.333
I thought perhaps
the place was on fire.

27:24.409 --> 27:27.071
Oh. Oh, no.
No, it's not. It's, uh-

27:27.145 --> 27:30.979
I, uh
- Look, I hope you don't mind me making myself at home.

27:31.049 --> 27:34.348
L- I felt I should do something to
make up for my bad attitude today, so-

27:34.419 --> 27:36.853
It looks wonderful.
Yeah? Yeah, well-

27:36.921 --> 27:40.322
Uh, we've got rice.
We have gravy.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.020
We have fried chicken,
carrots, okra.

27:43.094 --> 27:46.530
Although, I think I'll let
you and Isaac have all the okra.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.768
Is something wrong?

27:51.836 --> 27:54.930
I just never saw a white man
in an apron before.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.736
Oh.
Yeah, well-

28:00.612 --> 28:02.637
Madam.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.612
Perhaps we ought to-
Ought to what?

28:08.687 --> 28:11.554
I have a bottle of
Armagnac brandy. Really?

28:11.623 --> 28:13.591
Forty years old.

28:13.658 --> 28:17.685
I'd
- I'd been saving it for the day Daniel came home from the war.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.897
Well, I think
you should keep saving it.

28:21.966 --> 28:24.127
You never know.
Someday, um-

28:24.202 --> 28:26.762
Someday what?

28:26.838 --> 28:29.136
Nothing. Never mind.

28:30.308 --> 28:34.938
My goodness, I haven't eaten like this
since Sarah and her husband ran off.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.072
She was your cook, before?

28:37.148 --> 28:39.742
Yes.
Finest in three counties.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.685
I miss her.
I wonder what's become of her.

28:42.754 --> 28:45.086
I wonder what's to become
of all of us.

28:45.156 --> 28:49.718
Well, I have a feeling that when this
war's over you're gonna do just fine.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.524
Don't tell me.
You're a fortune teller too.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.792
Yes, I am.

28:54.866 --> 28:59.326
And I see you
getting married again.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.429
Starting a family.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.066
Being a wonderful wife
and mother.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.372
And, yes,
I see grandchildren-

29:06.444 --> 29:09.174
great-grandchildren
in your future.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.512
Oh, when I married my Daniel,
I took those vows for life.

29:12.584 --> 29:17.044
Well, it seems to me that a woman
as young and lovely as you are...

29:17.122 --> 29:19.682
shouldn't spend
the rest of her life alone.

29:25.563 --> 29:29.727
You know, I was wondering.
Um, do you play the piano?

29:29.801 --> 29:32.326
Well, I can make music
on that one.

29:32.403 --> 29:35.099
Yeah? Yeah. Anybody can.
It-It's a player piano.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.607
You're kidding me.
A player piano.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.666
Does it work?
I don't know.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.871
It's been a long time
since I felt like music.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.972
Well, I feel like music.
Show me how it works.

29:46.751 --> 29:49.879
How do you, uh-
Well, let's see.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.889
<i>You have to pump the pedals.</i>

29:52.957 --> 29:57.291
This is wonderful.
Would you like to dance?

29:57.362 --> 30:00.889
Well, if you stop pumping the pedals,
there won't be any music.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.832
<i>Do you really think
we need any?</i>

30:07.238 --> 30:09.968
Well, you are quite the charmer,
aren't you?

30:10.041 --> 30:12.066
Who, me?

31:14.973 --> 31:17.635
<i>Everything's
gonna be all right.</i>

31:19.878 --> 31:22.108
Hello, Isaac.
Captain.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.307
Hello. Congratulations.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.373
Don't mind him, Captain.

31:26.451 --> 31:29.716
A lot of us just aren't used to
dealing with white folks this way.

31:29.787 --> 31:32.449
I understand.
Listen.

31:32.523 --> 31:35.219
The armies are massing for a
big battle near Fredericksburg.

31:35.293 --> 31:38.456
Now, these folks, their best bet
is to follow theJames River west...

31:38.529 --> 31:40.656
until they get
to Buckingham County.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.565
So you are a voodoo man,
huh, sir?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.796
No, I-I'm not, Isaac.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.361
L- I can't explain it
to you, but...

31:48.439 --> 31:51.567
I promise you that my
information is 100% correct.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.339
<i>We know
you runaways are in there.</i>

31:54.412 --> 31:57.108
Shh. Get down. Get down.
Be quiet. Kill it.

31:57.181 --> 32:00.207
<i>Come on out. You come
out or we'll burn you out.</i>

32:00.285 --> 32:02.776
You got a gun? I ain't about
to shoot no Rebel officer.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.845
They'd hang me from a tree-
Give me the gun.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.551
What? Give me the
gun, right now.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.650
What you gonna do?

32:09.727 --> 32:12.093
You're gonna have to
trust me on this, Isaac.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.290
Damn you. What the hell
you doing? Trust me.

32:14.365 --> 32:17.857
Whoever's in here,
you come on out now.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.461
Back here, Lieutenant.

32:20.538 --> 32:23.098
<i>Come on.
Come on out ofhere.</i>

32:23.174 --> 32:25.870
Come on.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.344
- Well, well, what have we here?
- Runaways, sir.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.472
I have the situation
under control.

32:30.548 --> 32:35.349
- What's going on here?
- I have bad news for you, Cousin Livvy.

32:36.521 --> 32:41.458
<i>It seems that your slave here, Isaac,
has been taking advantage of you.</i>

32:41.526 --> 32:45.485
<i>Been runnin'slaves north,
right under your nose.</i>

32:45.563 --> 32:47.895
That is well done, Captain.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.066
Shackle these runaways.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.900
And then you look around,
you find me some rope.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.474
<i>You gonna hang 'em now?</i>

33:07.552 --> 33:10.316
Well, you got a reason
we should wait? Yes, I do.

33:10.388 --> 33:13.221
I don't know what your
customs are here in Virginia,

33:13.291 --> 33:17.387
but in Mississippi, executions
are generally held at sunrise.

33:17.462 --> 33:21.592
Well, now, if this was a trial or a
court martial, then I'd agree with you.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.328
But some slave-stealin' nigra's
a different story.

33:24.402 --> 33:28.839
He's worked by my side for years. I never
could've kept the farm if it hadn't been for Isaac.

33:28.906 --> 33:32.398
Then I can imagine
how betrayed you must feel.

33:33.611 --> 33:35.579
Bring him.
No.

33:36.814 --> 33:40.875
I'm a captain. I outrank
you. And I say we wait.

33:41.953 --> 33:45.389
I answer to my own captain
in the Virginia Militia.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.686
And Virginia is where
we happen to be.

33:47.759 --> 33:52.025
But I'm the one who made the
capture. Isaac is my prisoner.

33:52.096 --> 33:55.395
And since I outrank you,
I say we wait until dawn.

33:55.466 --> 33:58.196
And then you can return
the other slaves to their owners.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.768
All right.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.710
I want both of you
standing sentry until dawn.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.280
<i>This prisoner's
not goin'anywhere.</i>

34:20.358 --> 34:22.349
Yes, sir.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.985
<i>Y'all move on over here.</i>

34:28.132 --> 34:30.498
What the hell is goin' on here?

34:30.568 --> 34:34.937
Look. L- I ha-had to do something.
L- I didn't have a choice.

34:35.005 --> 34:38.032
So you just turn Isaac over
to save your own stinkin' skin?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.577
No. L-I'll get him out.
How?

34:40.645 --> 34:43.614
I don't know. I had to buy
us some time, that's all.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.206
Wonderful. Double sentries
and Montgomery tying the noose.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.411
Maybe you ought to look
into your crystal ball.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.420
Would you stop playing games.

34:50.487 --> 34:53.855
I know you sympathize with the
slaves and care a lot about Isaac.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.361
You're loyal to Virginia, but you can't
stand how the South treats black people.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.623
You and I are
on the same side here.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.756
It's about time we start
fighting for it together.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.466
All right.
All right.

35:06.537 --> 35:09.370
I still have my rifle,
but it won't do us any good.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.431
What are you talking about?

35:11.509 --> 35:13.534
Not unless you have ammunition.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.671
Wait a second. You mean,
the other day in the barn-

35:16.747 --> 35:19.682
I never said it was loaded.

35:19.750 --> 35:23.618
- Well, it might come in handy anyway.
- What might?

35:25.923 --> 35:28.357
Sleep.

35:28.426 --> 35:32.089
Uh, might come in handy
before dawn.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.461
<i>Then things might get
back to normal around here.</i>

35:34.532 --> 35:38.332
<i>No, things will never get back to
normal until the Union is vanquished,</i>

35:38.402 --> 35:43.704
and free white Southerners
can again live like civilized men.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.368
Isn't that right, Captain?

35:46.444 --> 35:49.641
Are you implying something
with your tone, sir?

35:49.714 --> 35:53.480
No.
No, no, nothing at all.

35:54.619 --> 35:58.715
How relieved you must be to know that you
will no longer be an unwitting party...

35:58.789 --> 36:00.723
to the Underground Railroad.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.225
You'll never know
how it makes me feel.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.728
You can rest assured had my
Cousin Livvy known anything...

36:05.796 --> 36:08.060
she would've turned over
the slaves immediately.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.191
Hmm. Well, of course.

36:10.268 --> 36:15.069
I've always believed her to be a very
special woman. Very special, indeed.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.600
Cousin Livvy.

36:18.676 --> 36:23.340
Perhaps this is that, uh,
occasion you've been waiting for.

36:23.414 --> 36:27.942
Occasion? Cousin Livvy has been
saving a special bottle of Armagnac.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.886
Oh, no, Aubrey, I-
Well, come on now, Cousin.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.946
This is a night
of personal triumph.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.822
A traitor in our midst
has been exposed.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.884
Fetch it for us, darlin'.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.729
<i>So, Captain-</i>

36:46.804 --> 36:49.466
<i>What part ofTupelo are you
from? Where's Olivia and Isaac?</i>

36:49.540 --> 36:52.373
Sir, I-I believe you're mistaken.
I'm from Natchez.

36:52.443 --> 36:55.207
<i>- As I told you.
Gentlemen, here we are.</i>

36:55.279 --> 37:00.046
Yes. Why don't we light these
other candles here, Cousin Livvy?

37:00.117 --> 37:05.885
Give us a nicer atmosphere
to enjoy our 1821 Armagnac.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.051
<i>If you'd allow me, Captain,
I'd like to make the first toast.</i>

37:09.126 --> 37:11.890
<i>By all means, Lieutenant.
Here you are.</i>

37:11.963 --> 37:13.954
Cousin.

37:16.667 --> 37:20.433
- To victory.
- Up your nose with a rubber hose.

37:20.504 --> 37:22.495
And may
the right side prevail.

37:25.743 --> 37:29.611
Are you a dancing man,
Lieutenant? What gentleman isn't?

37:29.680 --> 37:32.114
<i>Well, Cousin Livvy and I
gave it a try earlier tonight,</i>

37:32.183 --> 37:34.310
but my wound
made it difficult for me.

37:34.385 --> 37:37.252
I imagine right about now she
would relish a turn about the floor.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.312
Oh, no, Aubrey,
it's late.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.826
Oh, now don't you deny a loyal
suitor without at least one waltz.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.123
Oh, brother.

37:48.499 --> 37:51.434
Oh, boy.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.366
You play beautifully.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.976
My, but you dance forcefully.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.178
I'm sorry.
I'm so rusty.

38:09.253 --> 38:12.416
I believe it is customary
for the man to lead.

38:14.792 --> 38:19.058
<i>You poured 1821 Armagnac in
the coffee? Are you crazy?</i>

38:19.130 --> 38:21.291
<i>You know, Miss Olivia,</i>

38:21.365 --> 38:24.562
there is a reason that I come
to your farm as often as I do.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.762
Well, it can't be for the food.

38:26.837 --> 38:29.635
Yankees stole that
a long time ago.

38:29.707 --> 38:32.676
No, my dear.
It is not for the food.

38:36.914 --> 38:39.314
I see that the two of you
might like to be alone.

38:39.383 --> 38:44.047
<i>Why don't I take this opportunity to take
some of this fine coffee out to your boys?</i>

38:44.121 --> 38:47.249
- Well, how very thoughtful of you.
- Well, thank you.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.793
If you'll excuse me then.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.921
<i>Join me on the settee.</i>

39:04.442 --> 39:08.208
<i>In for a long night,
aren't you?</i>

39:08.279 --> 39:11.544
There you go.
Much obliged.

39:14.218 --> 39:18.018
Ew-whee. Now this ain't
just coffee, Captain.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.024
No. Compliments of
your lieutenant.

39:21.092 --> 39:26.325
He told me to tell you that, uh, you
and your partner make a fine unit.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.388
Well, then, uh-

39:31.969 --> 39:33.994
Ahhh.

39:34.071 --> 39:37.302
That will make the evening
more bearable. I thank you, sir.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.366
I tell you what though.
No reason to stop.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.775
Oh, uh, I'm on duty here,
Captain.

39:41.846 --> 39:44.815
Look at them.
Go on.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.873
They goin' anywhere?

39:46.951 --> 39:48.942
No.

39:49.019 --> 39:52.716
No. Besides, I could
use a nip of this myself.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.053
Ahhh.
Ahhh.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.791
That ain't just
corn squeezings.

40:00.865 --> 40:03.561
No, sir. Here you go.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.675
Hey, where's
your partner, huh?

40:15.746 --> 40:19.614
Oh, he's out walking the perimeter
the first half of the night.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.117
Figured one of us
ought to be warm.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.677
Yeah.

40:26.023 --> 40:29.515
Shh! You don't want
him comin' in here.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.618
More for us.
Oh, yeah.

40:31.695 --> 40:35.324
What was your name,
anyway, huh? Barron.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.507
You folks take this key,
let yourselves out.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.544
You head for theJames River west.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.636
Good luck to you.
Now, you trust me?

40:49.713 --> 40:51.943
There's still two more of
them out there. And two of us.

40:52.016 --> 40:54.678
Get the rifle.
Yes, sir.

40:54.752 --> 40:58.483
- Why was I given this assignment so close to you?
- Must've had a run of bad luck, dear.

40:58.556 --> 41:01.354
L- I believe it was destiny.

41:01.425 --> 41:03.450
Believe what you want, sir.

41:03.527 --> 41:07.964
But the man who wins my heart will
need more than destiny on his side.

41:11.469 --> 41:17.271
Sam, the guy's gonna be coming
around that corner right about...

41:17.341 --> 41:19.332
<i>now.
Excuse me.</i>

41:19.410 --> 41:21.378
Good night.

41:21.445 --> 41:25.313
Isaac, come on.
Let's get him in the barn.

41:25.382 --> 41:28.146
A woman like you should be loved
and cared for and fussed over.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.585
I agree completely.
By a husband.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.747
Oh, is that a proposal
of marriage? Lieutenant.

41:32.823 --> 41:36.122
I might even choose to overlook the
sins and indiscretions of my intended.

41:36.193 --> 41:39.856
Indiscretions I might otherwise
punish very severely.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.091
What are you talking about?

41:42.166 --> 41:44.191
I'm talking about
your dear cousin...

41:44.268 --> 41:46.759
and that Yankee uniform I
found folded up in your shed.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.169
The one with the bullet hole
in the sleeve.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.231
You surprise me, Miss Olivia.

41:51.308 --> 41:53.333
I took you for
a woman of substance.

41:53.410 --> 41:55.674
<i>You know,
we hang sympathizers.</i>

41:55.746 --> 41:58.909
Perhaps you'd like to swing
alongside your beloved Isaac.

41:58.983 --> 42:01.281
Let her go.

42:02.953 --> 42:05.183
You wouldn't be thinking
of shooting a fellow officer?

42:05.256 --> 42:08.282
I would if he were thinking about
raping my cousin. Let her go.

42:08.359 --> 42:12.557
Well, certainly. Soon as you tell me what
you're doing with my private's weapon.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.598
That gun hasn't worked
since Bull Run.

42:14.665 --> 42:18.897
But this one, on the other
hand, is deadly accurate.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.205
An officer but definitely
not a gentleman.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.272
Are you all right?

42:32.349 --> 42:34.408
Let's go.

42:37.955 --> 42:40.480
<i>I know this must be
a shock to you.</i>

42:40.558 --> 42:43.083
Having to leave your home.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.628
Leave your land.

42:45.696 --> 42:48.494
That's not what
I was worrying about.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.693
What's wrong then?

42:52.336 --> 42:55.271
You and I being
so different and all-

42:56.740 --> 43:01.575
I was wondering whether a man like
you could ever love a woman like me.

43:04.381 --> 43:08.715
Well, I think
that a man like me...

43:08.786 --> 43:13.120
is gonna love a woman
like you very, very much.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.762
Captain Beckett.

43:18.829 --> 43:22.128
- What is it, Isaac?
- A word, sir, please.

43:22.199 --> 43:25.259
Sam, uh, good news. There isn't a
Rebel outfit within eight miles of here.

43:25.336 --> 43:28.863
<i>And Ziggy says the odds of you
reaching the Mason-Dixon Line are 98%.</i>

43:28.939 --> 43:31.601
- Yes, Isaac?
- Well, sir, I've been thinking.

43:31.675 --> 43:35.611
Once I'm a free man, I'm gonna need
a last name like everybody else.

43:35.679 --> 43:39.445
- Got any ideas?
- Well, I considered Lincoln.

43:39.516 --> 43:42.815
Considered Covington, since I've
been with y'all since I was a boy.

43:42.886 --> 43:47.880
I considered Beckett, to thank
you for takin' me with you, sir.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.483
Well, you don't have to thank
me, Isaac, but I'm flattered.

43:50.561 --> 43:56.227
<i>Most of all, I like the way I feels
about being a free man.</i>

43:56.300 --> 43:59.030
Makes a man feel like a king.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.939
So, if it ain't too uppity,

44:03.007 --> 44:06.033
I'd like to be called
Isaac King.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.078
<i>Sam, you're not

<i>Isaac here goes on to have
a son named Emmanuel.</i>

44:11.115 --> 44:13.811
<i>And Emmanuel goes on to have a son

44:17.121 --> 44:21.387
<i>And that son has a son-
a very famous son.</i>

<i>Martin Luther King.</i>
