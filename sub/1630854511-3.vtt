WEBVTT

00:00.958 --> 00:02.750
<i>Our true enemy
is still out there...</i>

00:04.375 --> 00:06.875
...and the only thing standing
in its path is Elora.

00:07.458 --> 00:09.541
<i>You are the bravest man
I've ever known.</i>

00:09.541 --> 00:11.416
But you're not a great sorcerer.

00:14.541 --> 00:16.541
<i>Willow said I was Elora Danan.</i>

00:16.541 --> 00:18.500
The truth is, I'm not special.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.166
I'm rather fond of this girl.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.458
You need to bring her home.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.166
<i>If she's out there,
we'll find her.</i>

00:23.166 --> 00:25.666
<i>Did you tell him?
Who she really is?</i>

00:25.666 --> 00:28.916
The child has revealed herself.

00:28.916 --> 00:30.458
No rest till we find the girl.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.041
What's gotten into you,
Commander?

00:34.291 --> 00:36.583
Told me the legend
of the Kymerian Cuirass.

00:36.583 --> 00:39.041
Your father spent five years
searching the world for it.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.583
I know 'cause I was with him.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.916
I've done it, again and again,
and guess what?

00:43.916 --> 00:45.000
Nothing's happening.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.083
If you ever wanna see Airk again,
you have to focus!

00:48.625 --> 00:50.583
<i>She was Elora Danan once.</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:51.666
<i>She isn't anymore.</i>

00:51.666 --> 00:54.250
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha!</i>

01:35.708 --> 01:37.833
<i>It was ten thousand years,</i>

01:37.833 --> 01:40.041
<i>and about three weeks ago,</i>

01:41.125 --> 01:45.833
<i>Thuul, heir to the Kymerian Empire,
had been sick as a child.</i>

01:45.833 --> 01:48.125
<i>When his father died,
his younger brother, Tiberius,</i>

01:48.125 --> 01:49.875
<i>felt he'd make the stronger king.</i>

01:51.000 --> 01:53.916
<i>For forty days,
Tiberius lay siege to the capitol,</i>

01:54.916 --> 01:58.416
<i>starving his own people to force
his brother to abdicate his throne.</i>

01:59.416 --> 02:01.500
<i>So, their mother, Annabel,</i>

02:01.500 --> 02:02.958
<i>a fay of the Grove,</i>

02:03.458 --> 02:07.375
<i>forged for her son, Thuul,
a cuirass of pure Khromium.</i>

02:09.583 --> 02:12.333
<i>Then she assembled the Lux Arcana,</i>

02:13.541 --> 02:15.958
<i>a magical key
that activated the enchanted armor,</i>

02:15.958 --> 02:19.791
<i>so it would only serve
he who was worthy of its awesome power.</i>

02:24.500 --> 02:27.458
So, with no army at his back,

02:28.625 --> 02:30.166
no knights by his side,

02:30.166 --> 02:33.708
Thuul, the Rightful King of Kymeria,

02:33.708 --> 02:37.250
rode out of the city gates
to meet his tyrant brother

02:37.250 --> 02:39.083
and two thousand Death Dealers. And he...

02:39.083 --> 02:40.875
This is really fascinating.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.625
Uh, I can tell they don't call you
"Bore Man" for nothing,

02:43.625 --> 02:46.500
but could you just
tell me about my father?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.416
Well, I'm trying to. But you keep...

02:48.416 --> 02:50.000
Okay, well, can you make it short?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You know, your generation has, like,
zero attention span for-for epic tales.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.208
I love tales, okay?

02:55.791 --> 02:59.166
Well, excuse me for trying to add
a little bit drama and context

02:59.166 --> 03:01.083
to the night that we left Tir Asleen

03:01.083 --> 03:03.416
to find the Cuirass
and use it to defend the realm.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.500
From the Crone?

03:06.541 --> 03:07.541
Crone,

03:08.541 --> 03:10.333
Gales, the Wyrm,

03:10.333 --> 03:11.875
everybody's got a scary name.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.208
They all mean the same thing.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.666
It's the darkness that swallows...

03:18.666 --> 03:19.750
Oi.

03:20.666 --> 03:21.791
Where's Elora?

03:22.833 --> 03:23.833
Seriously?

03:24.708 --> 03:26.458
Throw a leash on that chit already.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.333
Spread out. She couldn't have gone far.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
<i>Elora!</i>

03:48.250 --> 03:50.083
Miss Muffin!

04:15.291 --> 04:16.750
Aw, nuts. Really?

04:29.500 --> 04:30.500
Hey, kid.

04:31.916 --> 04:32.958
What are you doing?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.291
Orders from the Queen.

04:38.875 --> 04:39.875
I'm taking her back.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.333
Wait. Hold on.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.583
You know who she is?

04:47.166 --> 04:48.750
Then you know why I can't...

04:48.750 --> 04:49.958
What... What was that?

04:53.958 --> 04:55.000
What's wrong with you?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.083
Nothing.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.208
You're not yourself. You need help.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.333
- Willow can...
- Don't...

05:01.333 --> 05:02.541
make me kill you.

05:10.833 --> 05:11.916
Stop!

05:15.875 --> 05:18.333
Commander Ballantine says
he's here on orders from Sorsha,

05:18.333 --> 05:19.625
to take Elora back to Tir Asleen.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.583
Hmm, is that so?

05:21.583 --> 05:24.208
It's not up to the Queen
to decide anymore anyway.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.541
It's up to Elora,
and it doesn't look like you asked her.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.333
Ballantine.

05:37.625 --> 05:38.875
Princess.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.625
Hold on.

05:43.041 --> 05:46.541
Someone just concisely recap
everything I missed.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.458
No? Okay, I'll have a go.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.208
Ballantine's lost his mind

05:51.208 --> 05:53.541
and he's trying to
kidnap Elora on that horse.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.291
Stay out of this, Boorman.

05:56.833 --> 05:57.833
I can't.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.666
Back in your scabbards, boys.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.791
I have to take her.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.833
Oh, I want you to.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.416
I really do. But maybe we should
discuss this first.

06:09.416 --> 06:11.666
He doesn't serve Tir Asleen anymore.

06:11.666 --> 06:12.750
Do you, Commander?

06:12.750 --> 06:16.666
I don't give a mule's soft wispy bits
who he serves.

06:16.666 --> 06:18.250
She's with us,

06:18.250 --> 06:20.166
and he's outnumbered five to one.

06:20.166 --> 06:23.125
I don't know how much
I can contribute here, Silas.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.333
Four-and-a-half to one.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.833
Who said I'm alone?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.083
- Free her!
- Me?

06:47.083 --> 06:49.000
- Are you sure I'm qualified?
- Just do it!

06:49.000 --> 06:50.083
Okay.

07:01.958 --> 07:02.958
What are you doing?

07:02.958 --> 07:04.958
A diversion. Help them. Shiv someone.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.708
What are you doing?

07:07.708 --> 07:08.916
I'm rescuing you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.750
- Was no one else available?
- Uh...

07:28.541 --> 07:29.541
Elora!

07:40.750 --> 07:41.750
They got her.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.000
- Can you track them?
- On it.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.291
If we catch them by sundown,
we can get her back.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.458
Ride on ahead.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.875
- What happened to them?
- Infected.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.958
- Poison?
- Possession.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.791
One of the Gales must've touched
one of them with his staff.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.625
Ballantine. Pinned him down.

08:07.625 --> 08:08.875
Turned him.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.708
Is the real Ballantine still in there?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Merrick?

08:12.500 --> 08:13.791
Can they still be saved?

08:13.791 --> 08:15.375
They're still in there, but...

08:16.125 --> 08:19.250
bad magic is corrosive, it eats away
at you until there's nothing left.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.500
I'm sorry, Graydon.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.416
When did you become High Aldwin?

08:22.416 --> 08:24.958
Oh, no, that's right. You're not. I am.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.541
All right, let's move out.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.833
Damn it, Bessie,
you're faster than this.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.166
I blew it.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.750
When there's an opportunity to be heroic,

08:46.750 --> 08:50.750
or even competent,
I... I... I freeze up.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.875
My father calls me an embarrassment
to the name of Hastur.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
And he's, he's right.

08:55.583 --> 08:56.833
Nah. Well, tell him it wasn't

08:56.833 --> 08:59.291
a particularly illustrious name
to start with.

08:59.291 --> 09:00.500
Why have they stopped?

09:10.708 --> 09:13.541
"The stars align,
the door is open.

09:13.541 --> 09:16.125
"The sphere turns, a God is awoken.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.083
"Extinguish the flame,
snuff out the light,

09:19.083 --> 09:21.875
"and exile the child
to the Thirteenth Night."

09:21.875 --> 09:23.333
Ah, so you speak cursed Pnakotic?

09:23.333 --> 09:24.916
They're gonna kill her, aren't they?

09:25.625 --> 09:27.916
No. If they killed her,

09:27.916 --> 09:30.708
her spirit would endure, be reborn.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.750
But if they banish her,

09:32.750 --> 09:34.958
they can imprison her soul
for all eternity.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.666
It's what Bavmorda was trying to do
when I stopped her.

09:39.416 --> 09:41.125
The Crone knows we're following.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.333
And, what exactly is in there?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.666
A noxious twilight veil.

09:45.666 --> 09:49.333
A swirling vortex of rage and madness
there's no escape from.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.208
Come on, there's not a moment to lose.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.333
I think it's broken.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.166
I can mend it.

10:35.541 --> 10:37.708
Then, you guys just lift up the wagon

10:37.708 --> 10:39.666
and I'll slip it back on.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.000
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.958
You can't just, uh,
levitate it or something?

10:45.416 --> 10:47.041
No... No.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.916
Okay. It's really good having a sorcerer
on this quest.

10:50.791 --> 10:51.875
We should ride ahead.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.958
If we let her, the Crone will use
this storm to separate and weaken us.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.291
We have to stay together.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.041
I'm gonna go get water.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.000
Let's lift up a wagon.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.416
Whatever it is, just say it.

11:16.541 --> 11:19.166
We're not gonna catch up to them.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.375
And even if we do, what happens then?

11:21.375 --> 11:23.375
They're turning into...

11:23.958 --> 11:25.000
monsters.

11:25.708 --> 11:29.666
Look, I'm sorry, but if there's a chance
that we have to kill them, we...

11:29.666 --> 11:31.166
We can't hesitate.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.000
I didn't hesitate.
I was trying to save you.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.208
I don't need saving, Jade.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.708
I can take care of myself, okay?

11:41.708 --> 11:43.458
No, you can't. You can't, Kit.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.708
Every time we spar, I beat you.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.750
I...

11:50.291 --> 11:51.291
What?

11:53.625 --> 11:54.625
You're saying...

11:55.833 --> 11:57.250
You let me win?

12:00.125 --> 12:01.250
Why would you do that?

12:01.250 --> 12:03.000
Because, Kit, your mother...

12:04.958 --> 12:06.666
She ordered you to be my friend?

12:06.666 --> 12:09.416
No. She just asked me to train with you.

12:09.416 --> 12:12.666
But only in the beginning,
then I did it 'cause I... I liked it.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.208
I never thought that you would be
fighting for your life.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.125
Kit, wait.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.000
No, it's okay. I...
I'm just glad you told me.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.583
Nice work. Can we go?

12:39.333 --> 12:42.583
Yeah, right after my heart explodes,
I should be good to go.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.541
- Think I pulled my groin.
- Don't say "groin" in mixed company.

12:45.541 --> 12:48.000
What you all lyin' around for?
We need to be moving.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.500
You're not wrong there.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.666
Oh.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.625
Greetings, weary traveler.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.041
Yes, you. Come.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.250
Feast upon our modest repast.

13:40.833 --> 13:44.458
Though we are but humble woodswomen,
what's ours is yours.

13:44.458 --> 13:45.708
Help me, please.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.458
Oh.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.416
Gather from your dishevelment
and woeful aspect,

13:50.416 --> 13:52.416
you've gotten yourself
a bit turned around out here

13:52.416 --> 13:53.875
in the uncultivated territories.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.083
Listen, we don't have much time.

13:56.583 --> 14:00.416
See, they just don't teach young people
situational awareness anymore.

14:00.416 --> 14:01.583
Do you not agree, Anne?

14:01.583 --> 14:05.708
Oh. This is Anne, by the way. I'm Hubert.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.625
And what may we ask is your appellation?

14:09.625 --> 14:11.625
- My what?
- What's your name, love?

14:13.875 --> 14:14.875
Elora.

14:15.750 --> 14:16.750
Ah.

14:17.208 --> 14:20.708
No doubt named in deference
to the True Empress.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.958
That is a lot of pressure

14:22.958 --> 14:24.750
to heap on a youngin, if you ask me.

14:25.916 --> 14:28.541
- Though, I have not been so blessed...
- I... Ugh.

14:28.541 --> 14:31.458
- Thus would not speculate about the pride
- Oh, my...

14:31.458 --> 14:34.708
that one must feel when you see
the fruit of your loins...

14:34.708 --> 14:37.041
- Hubert, please.
- ...magic itself into the world.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.000
- Please. Just shut up.
- Yeah. Got it.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.541
There are men coming for me.

14:41.958 --> 14:42.958
Oh.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.791
We do not doubt that.

14:45.791 --> 14:48.875
You do have a pleasing aspect
and fine complexion...

14:48.875 --> 14:52.250
No, wicked men,
and they're on their way here right now.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.916
And when they get here,
they're gonna take me and...

14:55.500 --> 14:57.625
I don't know what they're gonna do to you,

14:57.625 --> 14:58.916
but it won't be pleasant.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.083
So let's get moving, huh? Please. Come on.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.291
Right. Do you know what? You see this?

15:04.291 --> 15:06.708
Call him Roargoth,
after my dear departed pa

15:06.708 --> 15:08.458
who watched over all us youngins.

15:08.458 --> 15:13.458
So if any wicked men think they're gonna
come here and disturb our repast,

15:13.458 --> 15:14.958
they're won't be so wicked

15:14.958 --> 15:16.791
when me and Anne are finished with 'em,

15:16.791 --> 15:17.958
if ya get my meanin'.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.708
You don't understand.
I know these men, or I used to.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.583
And they're not themselves.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.750
They're...

15:23.750 --> 15:26.166
They're changed or something.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.416
Right. You need to calm yourself.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.500
Start from the beginning.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.750
Come on, give her a mushroom.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.708
No, not that one. That's my one.
Put it back.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.541
Yeah, it's definitely left.

15:55.541 --> 15:57.708
- No, no doubt about it.
- Left?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.375
Left will take us through Pitiless Pass.

16:00.375 --> 16:01.875
The wagon won't make it.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.666
It will. That's fine craftsmanship.

16:03.666 --> 16:07.416
And Pitiless Pass, I mean,
while I'll admit is an unfortunate name,

16:07.416 --> 16:09.958
it's actually a perfectly lovely,
nice pass.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.791
Which goes by, might I add,

16:11.791 --> 16:13.875
a cozy little inn called
The Slaughtered Lamb.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.333
Kind of a home away from home
for me and my old partner.

16:17.333 --> 16:20.166
It's got everything you could want,
you know, in an inn.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.041
No. What about the other way?

16:23.041 --> 16:27.166
Through Capella Pastures
into Voluptuous Vale.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.000
I mean, that does sound nicer.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.125
Yeah, it also takes longer.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.208
No, it doesn't.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.458
- Does too.
- No, it doesn't.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.541
It does too!

16:33.541 --> 16:36.291
- No, it doesn't. I will cut you.
- Hey!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.833
In case you hadn't noticed,

16:39.833 --> 16:42.458
a portal between dimensions is opening.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.750
And when they reach it,
Elora will be lost.

16:50.916 --> 16:51.958
What? What's wrong?

16:52.333 --> 16:53.750
- I'm fine.
- You okay?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.333
He's fine.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.916
We split up. Cover more ground.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.666
You guys take the safe, long route

17:01.666 --> 17:03.541
and I'll head up to The Slaughtered Lamb.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.916
See if I can't find
the kind of help we really need.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.708
You and Graydon go with them
through the Capella Pastures,

17:09.708 --> 17:11.583
I'll go with Boorman through the pass.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.833
We'll meet up at that Vale of Boobs
or whatever.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.541
I think I should stay with you.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.541
I think I can take care of myself.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.458
Hey, Boorman, don't let anything happen
to my queen.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.541
Okay, then. I'd rather die
a thousand deaths than fail you.

17:31.333 --> 17:32.375
Good luck.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.541
So, like,
I don't know if I am, or not.

17:42.541 --> 17:46.041
Willow thinks I am,
but the princess definitely doesn't.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.125
It's like she hates me.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.625
I don't know why,
but no matter what I do or say,

17:50.625 --> 17:53.041
she just always takes
the opposite position.

17:53.666 --> 17:55.541
Do you know how exhausting that gets?

17:56.541 --> 17:57.541
May we see it?

17:58.375 --> 17:59.458
What?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
The mark.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.333
It's really you, innit?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.541
Do you think?

18:22.791 --> 18:26.125
I think we've tarried too long.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.916
We must depart this spooky forest at once.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.250
Oh. Thank you.

18:31.750 --> 18:35.833
Uh, find a fortress, stronghold.
Somewhere to keep you safe.

18:35.833 --> 18:38.000
Oh, no. I'm going to the Immemorial City,

18:38.750 --> 18:41.000
to rescue Airk from the Crone.

18:47.250 --> 18:51.458
Right, while we are unfamiliar
with that place or individual,

18:52.541 --> 18:53.583
we answer the call.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.791
The call?

18:56.875 --> 19:00.708
When the True Empress,
that being you, returns,

19:00.708 --> 19:03.375
she is to gather a great host at her back

19:03.375 --> 19:05.458
and lead them against
the forces of darkness.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.500
Anne and I would like to enlist.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.416
We will fight at your side

19:11.416 --> 19:14.333
and faithfully serve you
from now until our last.

19:17.708 --> 19:20.333
Well, I'm not entirely sure
that that's necessary.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.416
Oh, whoa.

19:22.416 --> 19:27.375
You are more than raw celestial power
and gorgeous skin.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.500
You are a symbol of hope,

19:30.500 --> 19:34.291
that no matter your creed,
nor size, nor disposition,

19:35.083 --> 19:38.666
we all share the same world,
breathe the same air,

19:38.666 --> 19:40.000
drink the same water.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.291
And we are obligated to protect it

19:44.291 --> 19:49.291
and, if need be, die for it.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.666
Couldn't have said it better myself.

19:54.666 --> 19:57.583
Trust me, ma'am, you do not
wanna go down that road.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.000
Oh, you are right there, sir.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.708
Violence is never our preferred path.

20:03.875 --> 20:08.166
Though I suspect your intentions
toward the young lady

20:08.166 --> 20:09.708
are less than honorable,

20:10.458 --> 20:12.333
maybe even downright dastardly.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.875
We all want the same thing.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.625
I doubt that very much.

20:18.666 --> 20:20.250
You are not a well man.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.166
I've never felt better in my life.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.708
I'm about to be rewarded.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.916
The only thing you're about to be...

20:28.416 --> 20:29.833
is chopped to bits.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.541
No!

20:59.041 --> 21:01.541
Come on, quick. We gotta go. Come on.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.166
Come on.

21:25.541 --> 21:27.166
Come on. We have to keep moving.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.833
Come on. Look, we're almost out.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.125
Please, just let her go.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.583
Please, I'll come with you,
just don't hurt her.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.666
You're responsible.

21:56.541 --> 21:59.208
Your arrogance and defiance
got them killed.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.500
Countless more will die.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.541
But you can still save them.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.208
All you have to do is submit.

22:11.916 --> 22:12.958
Come on.

22:12.958 --> 22:15.291
You are embarrassing me.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.166
Keep going.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.125
Oh, yeah, I'm trying. I just think maybe
his enthusiasm has waned.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.416
The Cuirass.

22:21.416 --> 22:25.500
Ah. Well. After Thuul impaled
his little brother on a spike...

22:25.500 --> 22:26.833
The part about my father.

22:29.250 --> 22:32.125
I was the young, handsome, heroic one.

22:32.625 --> 22:33.625
He was my, uh,

22:34.708 --> 22:36.291
slightly shorter comedic foil.

22:36.291 --> 22:37.500
And where'd you go?

22:39.583 --> 22:41.625
Why did you come back and he didn't?

22:41.625 --> 22:43.333
There's no such thing as fate.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.291
Okay, you get lucky or you get dead.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.208
I got lucky.

22:47.625 --> 22:48.875
So, you actually saw him?

22:48.875 --> 22:51.333
No. But I know what I know.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.416
How?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.041
'Cause if he were alive,

22:58.583 --> 23:01.166
if he'd come back,
things would be different.

23:02.666 --> 23:04.500
You know, the Cuirass isn't a weapon.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.125
It's a shield.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.208
Against what?

23:09.208 --> 23:10.208
Darkness.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.500
This wagon sucks.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.666
Oh, I hate it.

23:24.875 --> 23:27.458
You'd think that Willow would
contribute a bit more,

23:27.458 --> 23:30.041
being the world's
last great sorcerer and all.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.208
What?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.583
Maybe there's a reason
he moved the Nelwyn underground.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.041
Maybe he can't protect them anymore.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.208
Is that even possible?

23:48.333 --> 23:50.916
Can a sorcerer lose his mojo?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.083
Come on.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.000
Stop! Stop! The harness, it's gonna break.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.291
Seriously?

24:00.291 --> 24:01.583
It's old.

24:01.583 --> 24:04.750
So are we.
Remember working on McKraken's farm?

24:04.750 --> 24:07.583
Plowing the fields
from sun up to sun down?

24:07.583 --> 24:10.333
Still had enough energy
to dance with Kiaya till dawn.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.875
Uh-huh, yeah.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.833
I just wish I'd known then
what I know now.

24:14.833 --> 24:17.875
How precious it all is.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.666
Maybe if I had I'd...

24:23.125 --> 24:26.250
Boo-hoo.
You're breaking my heart over here.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.958
You know what you've got to do.

24:31.458 --> 24:32.791
What are you waiting for?

24:34.458 --> 24:37.083
When I was young, resilient,

24:37.666 --> 24:39.500
I could take the punishment.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.041
But now I have to be careful,

24:41.041 --> 24:42.666
- preserve my strength for...
- For what?

24:43.541 --> 24:44.666
For when it gets worse.

24:45.708 --> 24:48.375
How could it possibly get any worse?

24:48.833 --> 24:50.791
It can and it will.

24:51.541 --> 24:52.541
Trust me.

24:53.291 --> 24:56.083
And I can't let my emotions
impel me to waste my magic.

24:56.083 --> 24:59.625
If I do, I won't have enough
left to fight when we get to...

25:05.166 --> 25:07.583
Hey, I know where they're going.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.291
It's a graveyard.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.750
Hey, what can I say?
I'm as disappointed as you are.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.291
What happened to The Slaughtered Lamb?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.875
Must have gone out of business?

25:45.250 --> 25:47.583
Has anything you said been true?

25:47.583 --> 25:48.875
How dare you?

25:49.583 --> 25:52.875
At least one-third of everything
I've said has been true.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.291
I'm such an idiot.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.625
No, you're not.
You're just... You're very young.

25:58.625 --> 25:59.708
I'm going back.

25:59.708 --> 26:00.958
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.458
Maybe I can catch up with Jade...

26:02.458 --> 26:05.666
Okay, the guy who owned this place
was a close friend of your father's.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.208
Okay, we trusted him.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.291
And he's the only person we told
the secret of the Cuirass to

26:11.291 --> 26:13.541
because we knew
he'd take that secret to his grave.

26:17.541 --> 26:18.583
It's down there?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.958
There's only one way
to find out, Princess.

27:03.791 --> 27:04.791
Over here.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.791
Yeah. I'm not going down there.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.750
Of course not.
I need you to stay here and pull me up.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.625
Look out for the wererats.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.750
- What?
- See ya.

27:31.541 --> 27:33.708
Uh, what are wererats?

27:34.583 --> 27:36.708
Um, exactly what they sound like.

28:05.708 --> 28:06.708
A trap?

28:07.333 --> 28:09.583
Why would they leave
their horses out in the open?

28:09.583 --> 28:11.250
I don't know, why?

28:12.250 --> 28:13.791
- They wouldn't be.
- Huh?

28:13.791 --> 28:14.875
It doesn't matter.

28:16.125 --> 28:19.958
Up that path, across the plateau,
and through the gates.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.375
We are awaited, my brothers.

28:24.875 --> 28:25.875
We are going home.

28:26.625 --> 28:29.166
You're not "going home."

28:30.708 --> 28:31.708
You're gonna die.

28:33.791 --> 28:36.541
Look at yourselves, you're a mess.

28:37.708 --> 28:40.208
You're not meant to survive this,

28:41.791 --> 28:45.208
and somewhere deep inside
that rotting shell, you know it.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.291
What?

29:01.416 --> 29:03.541
I changed my mind.

29:04.416 --> 29:06.291
I...

29:06.291 --> 29:07.375
decline.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.500
You are going up that path.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.666
Make me.

29:15.875 --> 29:16.875
How did you?

29:18.208 --> 29:21.416
I'm magic, you stupid cankers!

29:22.291 --> 29:24.333
I'm the greatest sorceress there ever was!

29:24.333 --> 29:26.541
You are no match
for the will of the Crone.

29:26.541 --> 29:28.000
Oh, yes, I am.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.541
I am Elora Danan,

29:31.208 --> 29:33.250
and I will do a spell that will,

29:33.791 --> 29:36.250
that will summon the forces
of good to my aid!

29:36.916 --> 29:38.166
Kick all your asses!

29:40.375 --> 29:42.416
Okay. Show us.

29:49.041 --> 29:53.791
<i>Tuatha... athrock mora... hoatha...</i>

29:59.291 --> 30:03.791
<i>Tuatha... athrock mora... hoatha!</i>

30:16.375 --> 30:18.916
Stay away from her, silly ninnies.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.250
Solid insult.
That ought to put them in their place.

30:28.791 --> 30:30.166
Please, let me help you.

30:30.791 --> 30:32.416
I've seen the future, Jade.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.291
Looked into the void.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.208
The Eternal One will cleanse this world
of all disease and pain.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.916
We shall be free.

31:13.666 --> 31:15.125
Ugh!

31:16.875 --> 31:18.083
Did you find it yet?

31:18.875 --> 31:19.875
No, not yet.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.125
Then it's probably not down there.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.375
Boorman!

31:28.500 --> 31:30.125
Hello?

31:34.166 --> 31:38.958
You gotta come back to reality, Boorman.
This is indestructible magic armor.

31:41.416 --> 31:44.500
I can't believe I let you sucker me
into something so ridiculous.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.458
As what, Elora Danan?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.250
No, no, no, I'm with you.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.916
You know,
if she could actually do anything,

31:51.916 --> 31:54.375
then I'd say maybe
you were being too tough on her,

31:54.375 --> 31:55.916
maybe even punishing her

31:55.916 --> 31:57.166
for your dad leaving.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.333
But she couldn't even
do the simplest spell.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.958
And you're supposed to, what?

32:00.958 --> 32:02.375
- Just have faith in her,
- Uh...

32:02.375 --> 32:04.000
- that she's gonna save Airk?
- Boorman?

32:07.166 --> 32:09.625
You know what?
I don't think it's down here.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.583
Just, uh, pull me up, yeah?

32:11.583 --> 32:13.916
I would, but I think there is this...

32:15.083 --> 32:18.458
...thing that is looking at me
in a not-friendly way.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.541
Is it a wererat?

32:19.541 --> 32:20.833
I'm gonna say yes.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.208
Okay, in that case, don't pull me up.

32:50.416 --> 32:51.666
- Boorman.
- Yeah?

32:52.250 --> 32:53.666
I'm gonna need you to come up now.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.375
Come on then! Come on!

33:12.833 --> 33:14.666
We have to find another way out.

33:14.666 --> 33:18.333
It's a little bit disorientating because
some of these tunnels go on for a ways.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.458
So no Cuirass?

33:19.958 --> 33:22.916
Uh, let's try to break through
one of the burial mounds.

33:22.916 --> 33:25.625
If I get bit,
yours is the first flesh I'm tasting!

33:30.416 --> 33:31.416
Get off!

33:32.416 --> 33:33.416
Come on.

33:33.416 --> 33:34.625
I'm staying. I'm fighting.

33:34.625 --> 33:37.458
No! I'm the reason you got taken
in the first place.

33:37.458 --> 33:38.875
I won't let that happen again.

33:38.875 --> 33:41.166
No! I won't let anyone else die
because of me.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.750
Oi, he was mine!

34:03.750 --> 34:04.958
Come on.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.500
This isn't a fight we can win.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.375
Then do something! Do magic!

34:27.958 --> 34:29.583
We need to get everyone in the wagon.

34:30.125 --> 34:31.583
I packed a jar of sermillian wax.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.083
You what! You know how dangerous that is?

34:34.083 --> 34:36.125
It's fine. Relax. I know what I'm doing.

34:36.125 --> 34:37.791
There should be enough to repel them.

34:37.791 --> 34:41.375
If we can just get everyone to stop
fighting and get back in the wagon...

34:46.000 --> 34:47.416
On second thought, keep fighting!

35:31.833 --> 35:32.833
No!

35:34.791 --> 35:36.250
Silas!

35:47.458 --> 35:49.750
<i>Avagdu!</i>

36:42.375 --> 36:43.583
Silas?

36:52.208 --> 36:53.208
Silas.

36:55.291 --> 36:56.291
I can fix you.

36:58.875 --> 36:59.958
I can heal you.

37:02.833 --> 37:04.333
Don't waste your magic.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.500
There is something you could do.

37:14.291 --> 37:15.833
Give this to Libby.

37:17.833 --> 37:21.833
Tell her that I wasn't scared
because I've had a great life

37:23.208 --> 37:25.833
and that I died doin'
what I was supposed to,

37:28.625 --> 37:31.833
protecting my best friend.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.125
You did good, kid.

38:03.458 --> 38:04.791
Listen to me.

38:05.416 --> 38:09.458
Every road you've ever walked
has led you here, to this moment.

38:10.541 --> 38:11.958
You have to protect them.

38:11.958 --> 38:15.750
If you don't, Tir Asleen, Galladoorn,

38:15.750 --> 38:18.083
the world will fall
to the will of the Crone.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.208
But she fears Elora Danan.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.916
Elora must reach

38:24.916 --> 38:26.666
the Immemorial City, Jade.

38:31.583 --> 38:34.291
Do it.

38:34.291 --> 38:36.083
I can't. No...

38:36.083 --> 38:37.500
It has to be you.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.166
I'm so proud of you, Jade.

38:41.166 --> 38:46.083
Training you, raising you,
the best thing I ever did.

38:52.083 --> 38:55.833
Now please, release me.

40:16.916 --> 40:17.916
Are you okay?

40:21.291 --> 40:23.625
Horses are gone. They ran off.

40:24.083 --> 40:25.583
And I think they had the right idea.

40:25.583 --> 40:28.250
The Pitiless Pass is about to become
the Pitiless Lake.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.333
I don't think we can
get out the way we came in.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.541
There's another way.

40:31.958 --> 40:32.958
Those steps?

40:33.416 --> 40:35.250
No. We can't go that way.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.041
Why not?

40:39.250 --> 40:42.083
Okay, well, now you can do magic,
you wanna fly us out of here?

40:43.125 --> 40:45.416
No? Well, then I'm going up
the big, scary steps.

41:27.583 --> 41:28.708
Are you okay?

41:29.291 --> 41:31.375
Uh. Just need a rest.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.208
Then we resume your training.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.416
You've still a long way to go.

41:37.416 --> 41:38.875
Maybe if I had the wand...

41:41.833 --> 41:43.916
Wait! Graydon's hurt!

41:48.791 --> 41:49.833
Bad magic.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.291
We have to get him to shelter! Something!

41:53.291 --> 41:55.458
Yeah? And what do you suggest, huh?

41:55.458 --> 41:58.791
We're right in the middle of...
I don't even know where in the middle of!

42:00.166 --> 42:01.166
I do.

42:12.458 --> 42:13.500
Nockmaar.
