WEBVTT

00:03.281 --> 00:05.384
Police want our help with a case.

00:05.390 --> 00:07.671
- A woman's been charged.
- Sonia Stevens.

00:07.681 --> 00:09.600
We charged her with
murdering her best friend.

00:09.605 --> 00:11.549
If you help us get
the information we need

00:11.574 --> 00:13.381
you'd be eligible for immediate parole.

00:13.565 --> 00:15.114
Liz will show you the ropes.

00:15.139 --> 00:16.428
Thank you, Elizabeth.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.204
Can you tell him I'll do it.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.870
You lagger!

00:20.895 --> 00:24.238
Snitch! Snitch! Snitch!
Snitch! Snitch! Snitch!

00:24.248 --> 00:25.455
How could you do that?

00:25.480 --> 00:28.789
I think their stupid system of
punishing laggers has gotten ridiculous.

00:33.379 --> 00:36.330
So, I've been hearing rumours
that you're planning to step up.

00:36.355 --> 00:39.112
I delayed treatment to hold
the fort when you asked me to.

00:39.137 --> 00:40.659
That's how loyal I was to you.

00:40.684 --> 00:42.460
- It's okay...
- It's not okay, it's too late.

00:42.465 --> 00:44.204
Now they have to fucking
cut my breasts off!

00:44.229 --> 00:45.963
- You're just not here for us, Bea.
- What?!

00:45.988 --> 00:47.817
It's bad enough that you
stuffed up with Tasha,

00:47.822 --> 00:49.503
but it's even worse
what you did to Maxine.

00:49.528 --> 00:51.725
Everything I do is for
you girls, you fuckin' cow!

Your lawyer's here.

02:02.283 --> 02:04.917
You came all the way
down here to tell me that?

02:06.172 --> 02:08.782
Clearly you've learnt
nothing about delegation.

02:12.781 --> 02:14.514
You look like the cat
that got the cream.

02:15.764 --> 02:18.091
It's only a matter of time
before I walk out of here.

02:18.490 --> 02:20.903
Justice will prevail.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.018
Yes, I'm sure it will.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.429
_

02:25.454 --> 02:29.678
The Crown's case hinges on the testimony
of Nils Jesper. Your former associate.

02:29.703 --> 02:32.445
Alleged associate. Please don't
waste my time with repetition.

02:32.470 --> 02:33.984
I asked you here for an update.

02:34.009 --> 02:38.429
Well, they're being vague with
details, stalling information.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.726
Which, in your professional
opinion means what?

02:41.751 --> 02:44.065
I think they're trying to
pull a surprise witness.

02:44.552 --> 02:48.485
Someone whose testimony will
support Jesper's alleged activities.

02:48.854 --> 02:50.473
I don't know who it is.

02:50.498 --> 02:51.829
I do.

02:53.471 --> 02:55.034
- You want me?
- Yes.

02:55.059 --> 02:59.065
Mr. Jesper has admitted
that Ferguson summoned him

02:59.071 --> 03:00.644
to the prison to attack you.

03:01.065 --> 03:03.697
We'd like you to submit
a written statement

03:03.703 --> 03:05.195
- for the crown.
- I've already made a statement

03:05.200 --> 03:08.041
- to that detective.
- And to appear in court

03:08.047 --> 03:09.913
for cross-examination.

03:09.919 --> 03:13.404
Your identity will be
protected until the trial.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.400
- She'll have no idea this is coming.
- Come on Smith,

03:16.651 --> 03:18.068
this is Ferguson.

03:18.518 --> 03:20.694
Your testimony can help
keep her behind bars.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.681
If it wasn't Ferguson, I'd
be out of this room already.

03:22.686 --> 03:23.932
So you'll do it?

03:30.861 --> 03:32.103
Okay.

03:32.282 --> 03:34.025
On one condition.

03:34.713 --> 03:37.206
Once the trial starts she
goes back into protection.

03:37.212 --> 03:39.543
- I'll request for the board that we...
- I won't be doing anything

03:39.548 --> 03:41.188
until I get a written guarantee.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.512
- I want her gone.
- Attention compound.

03:44.518 --> 03:48.199
Attention compound. The
canteen is now open for H Block.

03:52.713 --> 03:53.953
Bea!

03:53.978 --> 03:56.271
Hey, I've been looking for you.

03:58.690 --> 03:59.966
Vitamin E.

04:00.683 --> 04:03.769
- For your scarring.
- Oh, thanks.

04:05.804 --> 04:07.818
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

04:08.655 --> 04:11.342
Just... oh, stuff, you know.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.824
Well, if it's Doreen, forget about it.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.709
There's plenty of other
people here who care about ya.

04:19.423 --> 04:20.624
Yeah.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.314
Any developments?

04:27.745 --> 04:30.031
She's just had a
meeting with her lawyer.

04:30.598 --> 04:32.458
She doesn't look so cocky now.

04:39.607 --> 04:41.379
18 months, tops.

04:41.403 --> 04:43.516
Ah!

04:43.541 --> 04:45.935
- Is that all?
- That's what the lawyer reckons.

04:46.091 --> 04:49.676
Sentencing hearing is in two
days, so if I only cop 18,

04:49.701 --> 04:52.193
you guys will get
released with time served!

04:59.922 --> 05:01.536
I couldn't believe it!

05:04.732 --> 05:06.521
What the fuck's happened to Joan?

05:06.546 --> 05:08.824
I dunno. She's not talkin'.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.925
- Hey?
- Hey.

05:17.992 --> 05:19.232
You okay?

05:20.515 --> 05:22.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:22.291 --> 05:23.491
How'd it go?

05:24.129 --> 05:25.770
Not so good.

05:25.795 --> 05:28.740
- What happened?
- Just somethin's come up that I'm

05:28.765 --> 05:30.772
- gonna to have to deal with.
- Tell me.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.604
I'm being victimised.

05:34.202 --> 05:35.403
By who?

05:35.428 --> 05:37.222
Somebody I shouldn't have trusted.

05:37.247 --> 05:39.514
And now he's conspiring against me...

05:41.077 --> 05:42.602
with Bea Smith.

05:45.231 --> 05:46.669
You're fuckin' kidding me.

05:46.825 --> 05:48.025
Proctor...

05:48.285 --> 05:49.752
random drug test.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.200
Just can't leave me alone, can you?

05:52.225 --> 05:53.425
Let's move!

06:00.416 --> 06:01.616
Governor?

06:03.409 --> 06:06.176
- Transfer papers for Kazeem and Leoni.
- Mm-hm.

06:06.690 --> 06:08.917
- You've been avoiding me.
- Give me the papers.

06:08.942 --> 06:10.147
Guy could get offended.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.898
I'm going for a drink after
work if you're interested.

06:18.222 --> 06:20.364
We need to get a few things straight.

06:20.469 --> 06:23.806
What happened in the lift
was grossly unprofessional

06:23.831 --> 06:25.572
and tantamount to sexual assault.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.911
Wow, okay.

06:29.779 --> 06:32.936
I'm sorry. That certainly
wasn't my intention.

06:32.961 --> 06:34.961
I guess I misread the signals.

06:35.747 --> 06:37.901
There were no signals.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.641
I am the Governor of this prison.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.945
Yes, of course.

06:43.243 --> 06:44.921
I understand you were upset.

06:45.162 --> 06:47.829
And that's the only reason I
didn't give you an official warning.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.057
You can go now.

06:56.339 --> 06:57.719
Thank you.

07:00.250 --> 07:04.897
Attention compound. Attention compound.
The canteen is now open for C Block.

07:05.571 --> 07:08.001
- Hey, any for me?
- Nuh.

07:10.571 --> 07:13.336
Ms. Miles? How's Tasha doing?

07:13.361 --> 07:16.773
Well, last time I saw her she was in
a backless gown, handcuffed to a bed.

07:16.798 --> 07:18.911
So, you know, not great.

07:18.936 --> 07:20.616
Can I see her? I want to help.

07:21.656 --> 07:23.895
Should have stopped her
pressing the panic button.

07:26.851 --> 07:28.974
Fancy a cuppa love? Or a chat.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.199
No, thanks.

07:32.214 --> 07:35.880
There's a lot of negative
energy in this place.

07:35.905 --> 07:38.503
Yeah, especially since you rocked up.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.946
Where'd ya hide the body?

07:43.314 --> 07:44.712
Lift up, would ya?

07:48.481 --> 07:50.802
You might want to help
me with the cleaning.

07:50.827 --> 07:52.929
And that way some of
the women might be nicer,

07:52.954 --> 07:54.415
if they see you helping out.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.674
They've already made
up their minds about me.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.989
They actually think I'm capable
of killing my best friend.

08:00.014 --> 08:03.389
Oh, don't worry about what
they think. I've gotcha.

08:03.702 --> 08:05.987
- Thank you, Elizabeth.
- Just "Liz".

08:06.012 --> 08:08.681
No, I'll just keep my
head down till the trial.

08:08.769 --> 08:11.332
Do you know if you want
to blend in a bit more,

08:11.683 --> 08:14.899
it might be a good idea to
change out of your fancy threads.

08:14.924 --> 08:18.542
I said I'd keep my head down.
I have no desire to "blend".

08:18.657 --> 08:20.526
So, what were your first impressions?

08:20.551 --> 08:23.161
- She's a stuck-up cow.
- Hm.

08:23.773 --> 08:27.474
- So you've already bonded, then?
- Oh yeah, we're totes besties.

08:27.499 --> 08:29.030
- Ha ha.
- Hm!

08:31.130 --> 08:33.380
- Oh, wow, that's... that's good. Mmm.
- Mmm.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.846
That's the best coffee in town.
It's from my favourite shop.

08:36.523 --> 08:38.605
Lukewarm, but good.

08:39.628 --> 08:41.157
You play your cards right, Liz,

08:41.182 --> 08:43.447
I'll take you there for a hot
one when you get out, okay?

08:43.472 --> 08:47.563
Oh. Well, I don't know how that's gonna
happen, 'cause Sonia's not saying much.

08:47.588 --> 08:51.738
That's all right, just give it time.
Just stay close to her and listen.

08:51.763 --> 08:55.150
The way to get people talking is
to let them fill in the silence.

09:01.306 --> 09:03.031
I hate silence.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.854
Mmm, try a scroll.

09:07.879 --> 09:10.068
No, I'm watchin' my weight.

09:10.093 --> 09:11.293
More for me then.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.843
- Really fresh.
- Mmm.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.873
You're a bad man, Donald.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.619
Good, huh?

09:25.112 --> 09:28.426
- Is Kaz in her cell?
- No, just me.

09:29.104 --> 09:32.454
- You like a cup of tea?
- Ah, no thanks.

09:32.479 --> 09:34.684
You still don't trust me, do you?

09:36.847 --> 09:39.733
I'm just here to talk to Kaz
about the panic button rule.

09:40.286 --> 09:42.723
Bea Smith's unwritten rules.

09:42.903 --> 09:44.705
She didn't make the rules.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.283
But she does enforce them.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.317
I don't think the women should
be punished for askin' for help.

09:51.342 --> 09:52.771
I agree.

09:53.062 --> 09:54.729
So do a lot of the women.

09:54.754 --> 09:59.038
But unless somebody makes a
stand, nothing'll ever change.

10:12.443 --> 10:14.945
Double spinach! You shouldn't have.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.751
Don't argue, it's good for ya.

10:20.210 --> 10:22.514
- Hey!
- Where did you disappear to?

10:22.539 --> 10:25.640
Oh, I'm sorry, love. I had to go and
see the prison psych, Ms. Westfall,

10:25.665 --> 10:28.328
'cause she's doing a whole
series of new rehab programs

10:28.353 --> 10:30.015
and she wants me as a guinea pig.

10:30.777 --> 10:34.377
Oi, Dors. How's the Addams
Family working out for ya?

10:36.652 --> 10:38.852
Leave her alone Booms. Leave her.

10:39.051 --> 10:41.955
Well, what the fuck does she
talk to Ferguson about anyway?

10:41.961 --> 10:43.164
Glove shopping?

10:43.170 --> 10:45.855
Yeah, that's good.

10:48.328 --> 10:50.528
Oi, Minnie Mouse,
that was fuckin' funny.

10:50.553 --> 10:52.674
Thanks... Shrek.

10:53.924 --> 10:56.197
- Now that's fuckin' funny, "Shrek"!
- Shut up.

10:56.519 --> 10:58.403
Ooh, she's coming, she's
coming, she's coming.

10:59.766 --> 11:02.201
- Bea, can I have a word?
- Mmm.

11:02.682 --> 11:04.632
It's about the panic button rule.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.856
A lot of the women aren't happy.

11:06.881 --> 11:10.044
If we're being threatened, it
should be okay to call for help.

11:11.168 --> 11:14.044
If anyone's got a problem, they
come to me like they always have.

11:14.070 --> 11:16.457
- They don't press the button.
- If Tasha hadn't have pressed it,

11:16.462 --> 11:17.693
- Rules are rules.
- she would've been rap...

11:17.698 --> 11:19.148
They're not your rules.

11:19.484 --> 11:22.041
- You just inherited them.
- Exactly.

11:22.454 --> 11:24.676
Whatever issues we have,
we sort them out ourselves.

11:24.701 --> 11:27.039
- We don't involve the screws.
- Sorry, but I disagree.

11:27.064 --> 11:29.293
- So do a shitload of us.
- What?!

11:33.090 --> 11:35.269
What the Top Dog says, goes.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.480
- Okay?
- That's fucked!

11:37.505 --> 11:38.877
Welcome to prison.

11:49.068 --> 11:51.992
No, hold my place. I wanna
get in the phone queue.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.799
What are you doing?

12:01.824 --> 12:04.525
I'm doin' my job, helpin' the women.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.445
What you're doing is making
things difficult for me.

12:08.331 --> 12:09.968
We're supposed to be mates.

12:09.993 --> 12:12.060
Yeah, well mates listen to each other.

12:12.085 --> 12:15.694
- Is this about Nash?
- It's got fuck-all to do with Nash.

12:15.719 --> 12:17.704
You still don't get it, do ya?

12:17.729 --> 12:19.899
Well, I won't let you
keep stirring shit up.

12:20.289 --> 12:22.958
- So what are you gonna do, eh?
- I'm serious Doreen.

12:22.983 --> 12:24.405
Come on. What are you gonna do?

12:24.505 --> 12:26.135
We don't need an audience!

12:27.479 --> 12:30.147
I respect your right
to choose your friends.

12:30.172 --> 12:32.649
And I respect your right
to even challenge me.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.775
I don't know what Kaz
has been feeding you...

12:34.800 --> 12:36.361
I can think for myself.

12:36.386 --> 12:38.995
We all can. We don't need
you deciding what's best.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.659
The panic button was put
'ere for our safety...

12:41.782 --> 12:44.706
and if you don't let us press it,
then that means you don't give a stuff

12:44.731 --> 12:46.902
- about our welfare.
- That's not true.

12:51.886 --> 12:53.965
- Don't do that Doreen.
- Oh, and what if I do, eh?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.907
What are you gonna do? Bash me?

12:55.932 --> 12:58.328
You gonna burn my hand,
what? Come on, I want to know.

12:58.353 --> 13:00.799
Don't... press it!

13:05.275 --> 13:06.972
Fuck, Dor!

13:07.431 --> 13:09.748
Oh, God.

13:09.882 --> 13:11.550
You shouldn't have done that.

13:24.858 --> 13:26.058
_

13:29.396 --> 13:32.881
- I repeat. This is a lockdown.
- It was an accident.

13:32.906 --> 13:35.932
Yeah, well thanks to you, we have to
stay back and check every single unit.

13:35.957 --> 13:37.937
This was a security breach, ladies.

13:37.962 --> 13:40.414
If someone was hurt, we wouldn't
know where to start looking.

13:40.439 --> 13:42.113
Won't happen again Mr. Jackson.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.214
J Block clear and in lockdown.

13:45.344 --> 13:46.687
H Block clear.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.253
Bea...

13:51.278 --> 13:54.405
- I should put you through the wall!
- Go on then.

13:54.980 --> 13:58.416
You wanna hang out with
The Freak, you be my guest.

13:58.908 --> 14:02.172
But don't you ever,
ever disobey me again.

14:24.639 --> 14:26.340
What's goin' on, Dor?

14:28.992 --> 14:31.462
Is this 'cause you
feel guilty about Tasha?

14:31.670 --> 14:32.999
What do you think?

14:34.873 --> 14:38.922
I think you must be pretty messed up
to get involved with Kaz and Ferguson.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.970
Well, at least I'm not a fence-sitter.

14:49.971 --> 14:53.578
Sittin' on a fence gives me a
really good view of what's going on.

14:54.742 --> 14:59.052
- You know Bea? She's not so perfect.
- No, she's not.

14:59.077 --> 15:01.045
But she's not like them.

15:01.070 --> 15:04.202
- But she never used to be.
- Oh, love...

15:04.702 --> 15:07.822
this place changes people, even you.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.048
Bein' in charge, it's a tough gig.

15:12.616 --> 15:14.134
I wouldn't bloody want it.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.914
No one wants it, that's the point.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.074
The women don't want
anyone in charge anymore.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.031
That's not true.

15:25.088 --> 15:26.429
It's not true.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.898
Last night wasn't an accident.

15:47.904 --> 15:50.232
If you can't control the women,
we're gonna have a problem.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.639
Did Ferguson have
anything to do with it?

15:54.645 --> 15:56.294
She didn't have anything to do
with it. She's not a problem.

15:56.299 --> 15:59.296
Well she's planning something.
I can see it why can't you?

16:01.251 --> 16:04.588
I can see the cracks, Smith,
and that means Ferguson can too.

16:04.594 --> 16:06.829
You need to remind
everyone who's in charge.

16:08.247 --> 16:10.899
Attention compound. Attention compound.

16:10.905 --> 16:13.425
- D Block are now called for breakfast.
- She's right, you know.

16:21.678 --> 16:23.627
Well played last night Doreen.

16:23.995 --> 16:25.281
You did the right thing.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.577
Women aren't happy.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.350
You all right?

16:40.686 --> 16:41.991
What are the women saying?

16:43.226 --> 16:45.217
- Who cares?
- I do.

16:48.014 --> 16:50.240
They all reckon that
Doreen did the right thing.

16:52.634 --> 16:53.952
Hey, Bea!

16:54.142 --> 16:55.681
I just wanted to clarify...

16:56.330 --> 16:58.295
panic button rule's
out the window, yeah?

17:00.766 --> 17:02.177
The rule stays!

17:02.183 --> 17:03.383
Really?

17:03.860 --> 17:06.260
Only it seems the women have spoken.

17:06.265 --> 17:08.511
Last night was an accident.

17:08.517 --> 17:11.465
Anyone tries that shit again,
they'll have me to deal with.

17:11.472 --> 17:14.557
Right, you hear that ladies?
What Queen Bea says goes,

17:14.563 --> 17:16.542
even if it's not what
the majority wants.

17:16.549 --> 17:19.867
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Kaz.
- I'll pay that one.

17:34.379 --> 17:36.136
- All right!
- Gee...

17:36.142 --> 17:37.390
Listen up!

17:38.499 --> 17:42.284
If you have a problem with the rules,
then let's get it out in the open.

17:42.289 --> 17:43.489
Hmmm.

17:43.878 --> 17:47.145
If you don't want a Top
Dog anymore, then speak up.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.264
Come on, let's vote.

17:50.339 --> 17:51.539
Hands up.

17:52.454 --> 17:54.321
Let's take a vote right now.

17:54.325 --> 17:55.832
Who doesn't want a Top Dog?

17:56.121 --> 17:58.125
Then what, they get shivved?

17:58.130 --> 17:59.430
No...

17:59.717 --> 18:02.040
no. No repercussions.

18:02.441 --> 18:04.409
- They don't believe you.
- Just shut up Kaz.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.199
- Well?
- All right...

18:07.727 --> 18:09.893
if you really wanna do this,

18:10.310 --> 18:12.010
All right, we'll do a blind ballot.

18:12.016 --> 18:14.313
Every woman gets her say.

18:14.721 --> 18:15.921
No intimidation.

18:15.927 --> 18:17.977
Yeah? Suits me.

18:17.983 --> 18:20.382
Let's just vote now.

18:20.620 --> 18:21.963
We don't need a Top Dog.

18:21.969 --> 18:23.969
Shut the fuck up, ya big, hairy lezzo.

18:23.975 --> 18:25.714
All right, how do we do this fairly?

18:25.903 --> 18:27.703
Three women take the votes.

18:27.996 --> 18:29.472
One from my crew?

18:29.792 --> 18:31.471
- Liz?
- Yeah.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.092
- One from yours?
- I'll take 'em.

18:34.459 --> 18:36.074
And we need someone neutral.

18:36.711 --> 18:38.110
What about Sonia?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.068
She's a newbie.

18:41.196 --> 18:43.078
- Why not?
- All right?

18:43.162 --> 18:44.362
Good.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.930
You spread the word.

18:47.492 --> 18:49.450
Yeah, we take the votes this arvo.

18:50.074 --> 18:52.105
The other blocks can
vote in their rec time.

18:52.111 --> 18:55.083
- Woo!
- Well done! Nice...

18:55.089 --> 18:56.594
- Are you sure about this?
- ladies.

18:56.599 --> 18:58.370
It's the only way I can shut it down.

18:58.376 --> 19:00.489
Yeah, and what if you lose?

19:04.535 --> 19:06.094
Are we seriously allowing this?

19:06.119 --> 19:09.278
It's a smart move. It forces
the women to put up or shut up!

19:09.303 --> 19:12.480
What if they vote "No Top Dog".
This place'll be a war zone.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.509
Smith wouldn't have done it
if she didn't feel confident.

19:14.514 --> 19:15.725
She's not herself.

19:15.731 --> 19:17.607
Nuh, she hasn't been
herself since the fire,

19:17.613 --> 19:19.207
and, the women notice.

19:19.719 --> 19:22.445
- Proctor's taking advantage.
- Smith will shut it down.

19:22.585 --> 19:24.784
- Let's go over those induction reports.
- Right.

19:27.179 --> 19:29.022
Women's prisons sure are different.

19:29.530 --> 19:32.050
Walford blokes'd just be kickin'
the shit out of each other.

19:34.527 --> 19:37.666
So, this Bea Smith... what's she like?

19:37.691 --> 19:39.898
Well, ah, she's, ah...
she's good for the women.

19:40.058 --> 19:42.414
Lot of junkies are
cleaned up thanks to her.

19:42.439 --> 19:43.860
Do you have protein powder in that?

19:44.438 --> 19:45.640
No.

19:45.665 --> 19:47.437
Body like that doesn't come for free.

19:47.743 --> 19:49.103
No, just hard work and discipline.

19:49.119 --> 19:51.961
Mate, I got onto this great supplement
last year, it's all natural...

19:51.986 --> 19:54.327
good energy boost. I can
get you some if you like.

19:54.352 --> 19:57.079
No. I'm good. Reckon you
need it more than me though.

20:00.455 --> 20:05.036
Lorraine, if you shut up, I can
explain it again, all right? Now listen.

20:05.061 --> 20:09.439
If you want the position of Top
Dog to continue, you stick a tick.

20:09.464 --> 20:12.511
If you don't want a Top
Dog, it's a cross. Yeah?

20:13.196 --> 20:15.991
- Yeah. No Top Dog, cross.
- _

20:16.016 --> 20:18.096
- Yes Top Dog, tick!
- _

20:18.121 --> 20:21.526
Okay. Yes. Three hours later.

20:23.293 --> 20:26.310
You can only vote once. Nice try though.

20:27.789 --> 20:29.516
Who the fuck are you?

20:29.542 --> 20:31.948
Well, I'm in for murder. You?

20:31.972 --> 20:33.905
Sonia's in charge of the count.

20:33.931 --> 20:37.042
Yes, and you've already
voted. Tina Mercado.

20:37.556 --> 20:38.756
So...

20:41.905 --> 20:45.235
Nice one. I reckon you
and I make a good team.

20:45.811 --> 20:50.055
Cross means no Top Dog,
tick means Top Dog, Lorraine.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.121
Claire. Thank you.

20:54.142 --> 20:55.671
Well done.

21:02.242 --> 21:03.937
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

21:04.484 --> 21:06.274
I'm just roundin' up the girls to vote.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.642
Oh, yeah... I'm ju...
I'm doin' it later.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.867
Oh, okay.

21:10.798 --> 21:13.608
- You feelin' all right?
- Yeah. Just tired.

21:14.842 --> 21:16.404
When's your operation?

21:16.673 --> 21:18.734
'Cause I-I-I been talkin' to people

21:18.759 --> 21:20.893
and, ah... you know just
gotta cut that shit out,

21:20.918 --> 21:22.666
'cause it, can just go everywhere,

21:22.691 --> 21:24.830
- and it's...
- Yeah, honey, I'm not sure.

21:24.855 --> 21:26.497
- Well, just remember,
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.522 --> 21:27.892
when it does happen...

21:29.121 --> 21:30.533
I'll be there for ya.

21:31.238 --> 21:32.628
Thanks, Booms.

21:32.702 --> 21:34.201
All right. I'll, ah, I'll

21:34.226 --> 21:35.760
- let you sleep.
- Okay.

21:37.335 --> 21:39.188
Bye. Bye.

21:41.904 --> 21:43.544
Hey, Bea...

21:44.670 --> 21:49.046
you, ah, you... you want me to make sure
that all the women are votin' for ya?

21:49.071 --> 21:50.629
I could have a few quiet words.

21:50.654 --> 21:52.014
Leave it, Booms.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.571
Well, no, I-I won't touch 'em or
nothin', it'd just be verbular threats.

21:55.596 --> 21:56.938
I said no.

22:03.318 --> 22:04.979
Oh, right...

22:05.004 --> 22:07.204
come on, spit it out. What is it?

22:07.942 --> 22:10.005
There's still no date for Maxie's op.

22:10.152 --> 22:13.306
So, I was... I was thinkin'... maybe
you could have a word to Vinegar Tits

22:13.331 --> 22:15.220
and find out, you know,
what the hold up is?

22:15.245 --> 22:17.074
- Sure.
- Oh, awesome!

22:17.518 --> 22:19.835
- Ta.
- Doreen...

22:21.999 --> 22:23.678
come and take over the steam press.

22:25.882 --> 22:27.361
_

22:27.386 --> 22:28.586
Come on.

22:30.634 --> 22:32.357
You want a taste of democracy,

22:32.532 --> 22:33.946
now's your chance.

22:34.735 --> 22:36.164
Don't fuck it up.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.893
Shouldn't you be out there
campaigning or something?

22:42.513 --> 22:44.550
- What?
- You wanna know a secret?

22:44.575 --> 22:45.775
Yeah?

22:47.797 --> 22:49.206
I don't wanna win.

22:50.086 --> 22:51.859
- Hey.
- I'm tired.

22:52.513 --> 22:54.870
Oh, God. I'd give anything
for the quiet life.

22:55.071 --> 22:56.871
It's not gonna happen here.

22:57.305 --> 22:59.164
Anyway, I'm not here about me.

22:59.718 --> 23:01.979
Apparently no date's
been set for your op.

23:03.355 --> 23:04.555
I'm not having it.

23:06.873 --> 23:09.115
My breasts are part of who I am.

23:09.793 --> 23:11.353
No one's taking that away.

23:11.378 --> 23:13.628
Yeah, but if-if you
don't have the surgery

23:13.653 --> 23:15.265
- then...
- I'd rather die.

23:16.571 --> 23:17.946
You can't mean that?

23:21.055 --> 23:25.516
I lived in the wrong body, Bea,
for 32 years of my life, okay.

23:26.211 --> 23:29.270
I woke up, every single morning,

23:29.295 --> 23:32.452
wanting to tear it off like
it was an ill-fitting suit.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.149
Just step outside it...

23:35.420 --> 23:36.855
and just be me.

23:38.745 --> 23:41.695
I'm finally happy, Bea, with who I am,

23:41.863 --> 23:44.888
and nothing, no disease,

23:45.855 --> 23:47.552
is gonna change that.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.557
So... go on then,

23:54.777 --> 23:56.058
talk me out of it.

24:01.282 --> 24:02.482
You!

24:06.378 --> 24:08.977
I'm voting for no Top Dog.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.590
Bea can go fuck herself.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.282
Oh, jeez. We don't need your life
story, love. Just put it in the bag.

24:14.608 --> 24:16.532
Lucy Gambaro, J Block.

24:17.646 --> 24:20.898
Any time you wanna get out
of those pricey undies...

24:21.313 --> 24:22.609
just let me know.

24:24.934 --> 24:26.400
Back off, Juice!

24:26.425 --> 24:28.435
- He he.
- God!

24:29.191 --> 24:31.180
Is she always so repulsive?

24:31.205 --> 24:33.737
Nah, sometimes she's just disgusting.

24:33.986 --> 24:36.501
- Birdsworth? Can I have a word.
- Yeah?

24:37.313 --> 24:38.513
Yeah.

24:39.306 --> 24:41.215
- Okay.
- How's the vote going?

24:41.843 --> 24:45.260
I reckon I've seen half the votes
and there's more crosses than ticks.

24:48.825 --> 24:50.457
What happens if she loses?

24:50.482 --> 24:51.739
- Liz?
- Yeah.

24:51.764 --> 24:53.871
- We're going to education.
- Yeah, right-o.

24:54.067 --> 24:55.267
Go on.

24:56.056 --> 24:58.204
- We're doing the tally after dinner.
- Mm-hm.

24:58.996 --> 25:00.431
Cross your fingers.

You know, she might not have

25:35.938 --> 25:38.011
I've been trying to hook
up with this guy for weeks.

25:38.017 --> 25:40.852
It wasn't Vera's fault they
pressed their panic buttons.

25:41.202 --> 25:42.446
She knew I had a date

25:42.452 --> 25:45.510
and she kept me on and sent Jake
home. She's playing favourites.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.977
I needed my most
experienced officers on site.

25:49.718 --> 25:51.921
Not that I need to
explain myself to you.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.897
Can you let the officer's
know that I'll be

25:53.903 --> 25:55.848
calling an early muster, after dinner?

25:55.854 --> 25:57.627
- What for?
- Last night's fiasco

25:57.633 --> 26:00.687
can't go unpunished, and I
need to claw back the overtime.

26:00.897 --> 26:04.684
Maybe you could reschedule
your quote/unquote "date".

26:09.939 --> 26:11.139
It's not funny.

26:15.213 --> 26:17.129
- Nice tats.
- Thank you.

26:17.134 --> 26:18.489
F Block.

26:19.159 --> 26:20.852
Kav, Block P.

26:21.532 --> 26:24.404
- Hey.
- Hey, that's Kay, D Block.

26:24.735 --> 26:27.164
Did you talk to Vinegar
Tits about Maxie?

26:29.416 --> 26:31.358
No, not yet, I'll do it in the morning.

26:31.364 --> 26:34.631
All right ladies. Everyone back to your
units. We've got an early count tonight!

26:34.637 --> 26:37.136
- How come?
- Because it took the officers

26:37.142 --> 26:40.008
hours of overtime to check
your units last night.

26:40.014 --> 26:42.180
If you waste our time you pay the price.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.621
What about the votes?
We're supposed to count 'em

26:43.626 --> 26:45.217
together, in front of everyone.

26:45.223 --> 26:47.658
I don't care about
your sandpit politics.

26:47.664 --> 26:49.782
- You can do that in the morning.
- They're not taking the bag back

26:49.787 --> 26:51.057
to their unit. They'll rig it.

26:51.063 --> 26:52.444
Yeah, well, you're not taking it.

26:52.450 --> 26:55.228
Right, we'll lock it in the observation
box and you can get back to your units.

26:55.233 --> 26:57.910
- Yeah, you happy with that, Mel.
- As long as you can't get to it.

26:59.756 --> 27:00.956
Let's go!

27:52.791 --> 27:54.370
You're a naughty girl.

27:54.376 --> 27:55.699
I beg your pardon?

27:56.699 --> 27:58.905
You're not as straight
as you pretend to be.

28:00.244 --> 28:02.417
Ah, I had to collect the shift report.

28:02.957 --> 28:05.860
Yeah, and your curiosity
got the better of you.

28:05.866 --> 28:07.103
- Yeah.
- Get back to work!

28:07.108 --> 28:08.368
Hey, whatever you're doing, it's

28:08.373 --> 28:09.584
- none of my business.
- Correct.

28:09.589 --> 28:12.294
I'd hate to put you in
a compromising position.

28:26.895 --> 28:29.488
I've got backup in case
this turns into a riot.

28:29.494 --> 28:31.632
I don't think we have
any cause for concern.

28:31.715 --> 28:33.093
You're confident.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.082
Cross.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.441
Tick.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.240
Tick.

28:48.513 --> 28:49.713
Tick.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.857
That's all of them.

28:52.065 --> 28:53.265
All right.

28:53.574 --> 28:54.966
So if you add those all up.

28:54.972 --> 28:58.120
Okay, so for no Top Dog, an extra two,

28:58.126 --> 29:01.432
it's 122 votes, and to keep the Top Dog

29:01.438 --> 29:03.922
it's 243. Bea wins!

29:03.928 --> 29:06.353
Recount!

29:06.359 --> 29:07.813
That's bullshit!

29:07.819 --> 29:09.711
- Bullshit.
- Oh, recount!

29:09.717 --> 29:10.920
All right, that's enough.

29:10.926 --> 29:13.382
- Wanna fuckin' go Liz? You wanna go me?
- Calm down, it's only a count.

29:13.387 --> 29:15.468
- I said that's enough!
- It's... it's rigged.

29:15.474 --> 29:16.686
- It's fuckin' rigged!
- It's rigged, totally.

29:16.691 --> 29:18.217
- Recount. I reckon...
- Shut up!

29:18.661 --> 29:19.861
We're done.

29:20.007 --> 29:23.620
I don't wanna hear anymore crap
out of anyone, you hear? It's over.

29:23.921 --> 29:26.428
- Now get your arses back to work.
- Yeah, right.

29:26.434 --> 29:27.634
Clean that up.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.519
What a bunch of sore losers.

29:49.276 --> 29:52.167
Unbelievable how naïve that
woman is. Is she insane?

29:52.173 --> 29:54.596
Or does she honestly believe
we're that fucking stupid

29:54.602 --> 29:56.857
and can't tell that
that vote was rigged.

29:59.285 --> 30:01.456
- She has just made her life
- _

30:01.462 --> 30:03.080
- a living hell.
- _

30:04.235 --> 30:06.035
She needs to be taken down.

30:11.769 --> 30:12.969
Forget about it.

30:12.974 --> 30:16.245
I got my sentencing today and
if I get out, so do my girls.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.983
I'm not jeopardising that.

30:24.557 --> 30:25.764
Come in.

30:27.802 --> 30:29.468
I heard about the result.

30:30.092 --> 30:31.426
You must be pleased.

30:31.431 --> 30:32.943
This is a written warning

30:32.949 --> 30:35.343
for your inappropriate
behaviour and insubordination.

30:35.349 --> 30:37.067
Two more of those and you're out.

30:39.826 --> 30:41.026
Fair enough.

30:41.118 --> 30:42.785
I'll take the punishment.

30:44.529 --> 30:46.929
I'll take anything you can dish out.

31:12.636 --> 31:14.284
What is with your timing?

31:14.814 --> 31:16.646
You always come when
I've got my pants down.

31:16.652 --> 31:18.449
Oh, sorry. It's my sixth sense.

31:18.455 --> 31:20.139
I can hear pants dropping a mile away.

31:22.072 --> 31:23.746
Look, I was coming to congratulate you

31:23.752 --> 31:25.772
- but I'll, um...
- Nah, come in.

31:26.509 --> 31:30.047
Let's pop a bottle of
shampoo and celebrate!

31:31.892 --> 31:33.445
Ah, shit!

31:38.142 --> 31:39.517
You wish you'd lost.

31:43.671 --> 31:46.401
So... how is everything?

31:51.746 --> 31:52.979
It's better.

31:54.613 --> 31:55.978
Thank you.

32:12.615 --> 32:13.863
I'm not gay.

32:15.021 --> 32:16.659
I don't care what you are.

32:23.361 --> 32:25.361
Hey, nursie...

32:25.366 --> 32:27.545
Ah, it's Miss Radcliffe to you.

32:27.551 --> 32:29.639
Yeah, whatever. I
wanna make a complaint.

32:29.645 --> 32:31.841
- About what?
- Maxie's surgery.

32:31.963 --> 32:35.023
You know, they're keepin' us
waitin' for a date and it's not fair.

32:35.131 --> 32:38.356
Um, so, can you ring the fucktards
at the hospital or somethin'?

32:38.362 --> 32:39.605
It's not up to them.

32:39.848 --> 32:42.172
Right, well, can you
talk to Miss Bennett?

32:42.178 --> 32:45.358
Or, like, to the doctor,
or, you know, whoever it is

32:45.364 --> 32:47.381
- that makes the decisions?
- It's Maxine's choice.

32:47.387 --> 32:48.587
He can...

32:48.701 --> 32:50.573
she cancelled the surgery.

32:50.579 --> 32:51.779
No.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.996
Why would Maxie do that?

32:55.801 --> 32:57.043
Hey?

32:57.049 --> 33:00.991
Hey! Nurse Ratshit reckons
that you don't want the surgery.

33:00.997 --> 33:03.081
So, you gotta come and set her straight.

33:04.768 --> 33:05.968
Maxie?

33:05.974 --> 33:08.117
Y-you gotta go out there and tell her.

33:08.408 --> 33:09.965
M... oh... hey!

33:10.832 --> 33:14.178
Stop paintin' your fuckin'
nails and listen to me!

33:15.134 --> 33:17.021
You've gotta come and tell her!

33:17.027 --> 33:19.395
She's right, Booms. I'm
not having the surgery.

33:21.316 --> 33:22.516
What?

33:23.675 --> 33:24.875
Why?

33:24.976 --> 33:28.696
I fought all my life to be like this,
honey, and it nearly killed me...

33:29.734 --> 33:31.480
and I can't give that up now.

33:32.118 --> 33:33.318
No...

33:33.832 --> 33:35.703
no... y-you... you, no.

33:35.997 --> 33:37.641
You won't have to.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.283
You know, just... just 'cause...

33:39.290 --> 33:42.329
you have the op, it doesn't
mean that you won't...

33:42.335 --> 33:44.535
be, you know, y-you won't be you.

33:45.894 --> 33:47.682
It's not just about losing these...

33:47.688 --> 33:51.039
there'll be chemo and I
can't take my hormones...

33:51.334 --> 33:52.719
and I'll change.

33:53.872 --> 33:55.260
So, you wanna die?

33:55.266 --> 33:57.372
I'll end my life on my own terms,

33:57.378 --> 33:58.654
- honey.
- You'll be dead.

33:58.660 --> 34:00.093
- Boomer...
- No!

34:00.579 --> 34:02.734
- If you don't do somethin' now,
- Mm.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.640
you will end up in the fuckin' ground!

34:04.646 --> 34:06.495
Hey! Maybe I'll beat it,

34:06.501 --> 34:08.717
- No, you can't die. You can't die.
- with the right diet and exercise?

34:08.722 --> 34:10.848
- You can't die.
- Listen, darling, darling,

34:10.853 --> 34:12.208
look at me, look at me. Booms!

34:12.214 --> 34:14.429
- We just have to be brave, baby.
- No, I'm not a...

34:14.436 --> 34:17.181
- baby, I'm not a baby.
- Yes, you will. Look, I'm sorry, honey.

34:17.187 --> 34:21.641
You're not sorry! If you were sorry
you wouldn't do this to yourself!

34:21.780 --> 34:23.864
And you wouldn't do
it to your friends...

34:23.871 --> 34:25.667
and you wouldn't do it to me!

34:25.672 --> 34:29.304
- It's my choice, Booms!
- Well, it's fuckin' selfish!

34:29.558 --> 34:31.681
- You are a selfish bitch!
- Hey, hey...

34:31.687 --> 34:33.353
- come here! You don't mean it.
- Don't!

34:33.359 --> 34:35.751
- I do! I hate you!
- No, Booms, no you don't.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.402
- No! No!
- Honey, come here. Shh.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.454
- No... I'm sorry, I...
- Shh.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.248
It's okay.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.915
Van arriving, to sally port.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.123
Welcome back, Proctor.

34:52.012 --> 34:54.830
I know that wasn't the
sentence you were hoping for.

34:55.275 --> 34:56.478
You know the drill.

34:57.464 --> 34:59.053
I would think wisely

34:59.059 --> 35:01.348
about how you are going
to spend your time here.

35:01.354 --> 35:04.192
You can't rely on Ferguson
because she won't be here.

35:04.198 --> 35:06.520
Where as you will have 12 long years,

35:06.526 --> 35:08.464
- with Bea Smith.
- It'll take 12 years

35:08.470 --> 35:10.309
to get out of this room. Are you done?

35:13.335 --> 35:14.535
Oh!

35:26.806 --> 35:28.343
You fuck!

35:28.685 --> 35:30.118
Fuck!

35:30.349 --> 35:32.456
Fuck!

35:32.520 --> 35:36.059
Fucker! Fuck!

35:37.373 --> 35:38.646
Well, hi.

35:38.651 --> 35:40.004
H1's outta milk.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.701
You just like hangin' out with me.

35:41.924 --> 35:43.637
No, we're really outta milk.

35:43.643 --> 35:46.219
No, you really like hangin' out with me.

35:50.533 --> 35:51.965
Fuck!

35:52.638 --> 35:54.083
So, I heard about Kaz...

35:55.238 --> 35:56.902
12 years, that's pretty harsh.

35:58.058 --> 35:59.258
Yeah.

35:59.264 --> 36:01.014
So, what does that mean for you?

36:02.858 --> 36:05.122
Well, might have to get
used to havin' me around.

36:08.718 --> 36:10.972
Don't feel like you have to
crack a smile or anything.

36:11.804 --> 36:14.079
Nah, I wouldn't wish
this place on anyone.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.190
I'm leaving Kaz's crew.

36:19.462 --> 36:20.730
Why?

36:22.542 --> 36:23.794
You know why.

36:25.635 --> 36:27.599
Nothing's gonna happen between us.

36:28.247 --> 36:30.406
Okay, sure.

36:30.903 --> 36:32.364
I'm gonna be up front with her.

36:32.789 --> 36:34.267
Tell her I'm joining you.

36:35.586 --> 36:36.905
I owe it to her.

36:38.607 --> 36:39.807
I gotta go.

37:19.515 --> 37:21.282
I don't really hate ya.

37:24.389 --> 37:25.589
I know.

37:29.105 --> 37:33.241
But you are right about one
thing, Sue Jenkins, I am selfish.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.589
I've had to be.

37:37.266 --> 37:40.403
Most of my life the only person
that's cared about me has been me.

37:40.617 --> 37:42.029
I care about ya.

37:42.234 --> 37:44.193
Like, I-I even love ya.

37:44.703 --> 37:47.309
L-like a, like a little...
a little bit. You know.

37:50.672 --> 37:51.998
I know you do.

37:56.086 --> 37:57.969
And that's why I've changed my mind.

38:01.882 --> 38:04.211
- It's gonna be tough but...
- Mm.

38:04.711 --> 38:07.943
we both... we both need to be brave.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.506
But I'm gonna have the operation.

38:13.096 --> 38:16.352
You know, I'll... I'll
go on the hormones...

38:16.687 --> 38:19.334
- Yeah... yeah!
- I'll go on the hormones either way.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.236
Yep, yep, yep.

38:21.527 --> 38:23.817
And like... and you-you
can still get new titties,

38:23.823 --> 38:26.379
you know, if you want, like,
if they... I mean, do you reckon

38:26.385 --> 38:28.681
they'll let ya have some of
mine, 'cause I've got heaps.

38:28.687 --> 38:29.936
I do!

38:33.770 --> 38:34.970
Thanks.

38:37.908 --> 38:39.491
Thanks.

38:40.992 --> 38:43.753
It's not about me. It's about the
others. They're gonna to be gutted.

38:44.366 --> 38:47.679
If I've just been given a 12 year
sentence, I'd be pretty pissed off.

38:47.685 --> 38:48.987
Yeah, you fuckin' would.

38:49.608 --> 38:50.808
You could appeal.

38:51.602 --> 38:53.291
Or I could fly to the fuckin' moon.

38:53.297 --> 38:54.965
How are you feeling, right now?

39:00.404 --> 39:03.024
A long sentence can be
a shock to the system.

39:03.122 --> 39:05.133
Especially if you're not expecting it.

39:07.107 --> 39:09.078
You're angry with your lawyer, yeah?

39:09.084 --> 39:10.884
You're angry at yourself.

39:13.027 --> 39:15.133
You don't have to pretend with me.

39:16.848 --> 39:19.781
I'm angry at the fucker
who put me in here.

39:55.246 --> 39:56.590
Hey...

39:57.434 --> 39:59.276
we all heard the news.

40:01.029 --> 40:02.482
I'm so sorry.

40:02.488 --> 40:04.179
No, I'm sorry mate.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.082
You know what this means
for you girls, don't you?

40:08.088 --> 40:09.288
Yep.

40:11.378 --> 40:13.070
Better make ourselves at home.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.837
You're an idiot.

40:17.366 --> 40:20.047
Fuckin' mess in here. Oh.

40:20.053 --> 40:21.259
Uh.

40:21.266 --> 40:23.605
Um, I need to talk to
you about something.

40:25.117 --> 40:26.319
Bea Smith...

40:26.610 --> 40:28.963
Yeah, I was telling Allie I
wanted to have a word with you.

40:31.865 --> 40:33.392
Well, can you give us a minute?

40:39.548 --> 40:41.175
I heard about your sentence.

40:43.331 --> 40:44.531
It's a bitch.

40:45.743 --> 40:48.127
Okay, I just want to know
that we don't have a problem.

40:48.982 --> 40:50.700
- No problem.
- Good.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.482
Good.

40:53.170 --> 40:55.620
Because the women have spoken, so...

40:55.732 --> 40:57.646
we're just going to have
to live with it, okay?

41:04.598 --> 41:06.957
- You're not to say a thing.
- Why, what are you afraid of?

41:06.963 --> 41:08.769
Just meet me in the
kitchen in 10 minutes.

41:13.404 --> 41:16.255
Not quite so much top coat, Susan.

41:16.261 --> 41:17.681
Don't call me Susan.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.577
Sonia made her fortune
out of cosmetics, Booms.

41:20.583 --> 41:23.783
- Like a million bucks?
- Mmm, a bit more than that.

41:24.006 --> 41:26.407
- Do you fancy a cuppa?
- No thanks.

41:26.413 --> 41:28.639
The water smells like Vietnam.

41:28.645 --> 41:30.093
- Ewww.
- Mm-hm-hm.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.179
Are you all right, love?

41:37.711 --> 41:39.804
Oh, love, come here.

41:40.106 --> 41:44.141
What's up? Oh darlin'. Oh.

41:44.741 --> 41:46.012
Hey?

41:47.018 --> 41:48.959
- I'm not okay.
- Mmm.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.902
I hate this place.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.398
And I miss Joshua.

41:53.404 --> 41:55.188
And have you called Nash?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.743
- I've been too upset.
- Mmm.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.747
Well, you're gonna have to call him.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.676
And you're gonna try
and work it out, yeah?

42:03.658 --> 42:04.955
Yeah?

42:06.830 --> 42:09.097
Good girl. You'll work it out.

42:12.486 --> 42:14.635
- See ya.
- See ya later. Governor.

42:25.894 --> 42:28.894
_

42:49.033 --> 42:53.413
Attention compound. Attention compound.
The count will commence in 10 minutes.

42:57.095 --> 42:58.849
- Hey, Nash. It's me.
- Hey.

42:58.855 --> 43:01.018
- How are you? You all right? Great.
- Yeah, good.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.738
- Hey, listen.
- Yeah?

43:03.227 --> 43:04.815
I want to meet Miranda.

43:06.516 --> 43:09.396
- Why did you stop me telling her?
- Because it's too dangerous.

43:09.402 --> 43:11.755
I'll be even more of a
target for Kaz and The Freak.

43:11.761 --> 43:14.185
That's fine. I'm used to that.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.492
But I don't want you getting
caught up in the crossfire.

43:16.810 --> 43:18.043
I'm not scared.

43:19.262 --> 43:21.266
- I got you to protect me.
- No!

43:21.548 --> 43:23.656
Everyone I care about ends up dead.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.174
What'd you say?

43:26.815 --> 43:28.147
You care about me?

43:28.488 --> 43:30.456
We should get back for the count.

43:35.126 --> 43:37.610
- You're shaking?
- It's cold.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.311
It's not cold.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.731
Now we can go.

44:05.088 --> 44:09.564
On this side of the bars,
emotions are intensified,

44:09.570 --> 44:12.202
it's so easy to lose yourself...

44:13.132 --> 44:16.723
in love, or lust, or despair.

44:17.556 --> 44:19.360
Because the alternative is just to...

44:20.657 --> 44:24.136
wait and watch your life tick away.

44:25.973 --> 44:29.298
12 years is such a long time, Kaz.

44:30.036 --> 44:31.929
Make it count.

44:32.712 --> 44:35.420
Stand up. Lead the women.

44:36.696 --> 44:39.148
Lead them the way you
lead the Red Right Hand.

44:39.154 --> 44:42.841
But how? Bea Smith runs this prison.
She's the Governor's fucking pet.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.260
She's not invincible.

44:45.643 --> 44:49.101
Why are you even here in general, Joan?

44:51.637 --> 44:53.026
What do you want?

44:56.066 --> 44:59.129
That man I told you about, the one
that's going to testify against me?

45:02.434 --> 45:04.105
I need him taken out.

45:05.670 --> 45:06.870
Permanently.

45:07.419 --> 45:11.142
Because without your star
witness your whole case collapses.

45:11.148 --> 45:12.860
He is a serial rapist.

45:12.866 --> 45:16.210
He's been preying on women for
years and getting away with it.

45:16.365 --> 45:18.742
- His name is Nils... Jesper.
- Jesper.

45:20.896 --> 45:22.617
I know about him.

45:23.614 --> 45:29.077
He's the guy Bea Smith asked me to
find, right before I got arrested.

45:31.253 --> 45:32.980
What's in it for me?

45:34.294 --> 45:36.019
We both have an enemy.

45:37.129 --> 45:39.600
You take care of
Jesper, I'll handle her.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.318
What are you gonna do?

45:44.303 --> 45:45.811
Kill Bea Smith.

45:49.194 --> 45:51.660
_

45:53.112 --> 45:55.270
I know now, how to do it.

45:56.394 --> 45:59.425
Bea Smith will be dead by 3pm.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.341
I can't kill a woman.

46:01.347 --> 46:02.630
You're not!

46:03.143 --> 46:04.995
You won't be anywhere near it.

46:05.558 --> 46:07.382
Just creating a distraction, that's all.

46:08.017 --> 46:09.217
_

46:09.223 --> 46:12.728
One day it will come
down to just you and her.

46:12.734 --> 46:15.108
- _
- And one of you will die.

46:15.114 --> 46:16.314
It's inevitable.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.586
_

46:17.592 --> 46:19.570
All we're doing is just
making sure it's not you.

46:21.797 --> 46:23.484
Push the panic button!

46:25.995 --> 46:28.899
- _
- The new season of Wentworth.

46:28.905 --> 46:32.713

46:34.194 --> 46:37.395
Wanna catch up with
Wentworth's Lizzie Birdsworth?
