00:46.569 --> 00:48.359
Okay, everybody.

00:48.394 --> 00:50.678
We've got a ton of great prizes up here.

00:50.713 --> 00:55.272
Tickets are only four for a dollar.
Come on. Step up and get in the runnin;

00:55.307 --> 00:56.633
You can win a gift basket,

00:56.668 --> 01:00.925
win a steak dinner,
or you can win yourself a cherry pie.

01:00.960 --> 01:05.010
Whoa.! You really want that pie, huh?

01:07.002 --> 01:11.832
- Mmm. That smells delicious.
- Yes, ma'am. It's a good pie. Good pie.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.045
You could win this lovely gift basket,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.045
make you look pretty, smell good...
or a steak dinner.

01:17.672 --> 01:20.672
Excuse me.

01:21.792 --> 01:25.748
Uh-oh! Looks like
you've got some competition.

01:29.528 --> 01:36.041
And last but not least,
we have a heavenly homemade cherry pie.

01:36.076 --> 01:42.774
And the winner is...
5263.

01:42.809 --> 01:45.774
- Oh! That's me!
- Well, come up here, young lady.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.483
There you go.
A homemade cherry pie.

01:49.518 --> 01:52.664
Listen, if you need
any help finishing this,

01:52.699 --> 01:55.968
you let me know.

01:56.003 --> 02:00.448
Folks, that's it. That's it.

02:09.279 --> 02:10.818
- Give me that pie.
- What are you doing?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.891
Don't make me hurt you.
Just give me that pie!

02:12.926 --> 02:15.891
You all right?

02:31.271 --> 02:33.656
Monk 2x11.
Mr. Monk and the Three Pies

03:32.187 --> 03:34.073
Her wallet was still full of cash.

03:34.108 --> 03:36.059
These guys just wanted this car.

03:36.094 --> 03:39.059
- Is that mace?
- Yeah. We just found an empty canister.

03:39.849 --> 03:43.090
She must have put up a hell of a fight.
Good for her.

03:46.673 --> 03:47.839
Who called Monk?

03:47.874 --> 03:50.918
Oh, they're not here for a job.
They're just here to pick up a check.

03:50.953 --> 03:54.658
The Hazelwood case.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.443
- Lookin' for this?
- Thanks.

04:00.815 --> 04:03.279
- What happened here?
- Just a carjacking, Monk.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.063
A woman was killed.
We can handle it.

04:05.098 --> 04:06.881
They didn't take her purse?

04:06.916 --> 04:09.696
Just a punk kid out for a joyride.

04:09.731 --> 04:12.000
Look, Monk, we're gonna try
to crack this one ourselves,

04:12.035 --> 04:13.636
just for the novelty of it, okay?

04:13.671 --> 04:15.223
It doesn't make any sense.

04:15.258 --> 04:18.112
Why this car?
It doesn't even have a tape player.

04:18.147 --> 04:20.482
It runs.
It's a convertible.

04:20.517 --> 04:23.482
That's all the reason they need.

04:23.754 --> 04:25.093
Oh, no.

04:25.128 --> 04:26.716
- What?
- Oh, it's nothing.

04:26.751 --> 04:28.577
What is it?

04:28.612 --> 04:31.577
Uh, just the barricades are a mess.
They're uneven.

04:32.292 --> 04:35.621
- You're trying to get rid of me.
- No, I'm not.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.316
Look at the one on the right.
It's in the ditch.

04:38.351 --> 04:42.198
I know what you're doing.
It's... It's not gonna work.

04:43.538 --> 04:46.481
The one in the middle is all "facacha."

04:48.577 --> 04:51.212
Excuse me.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.608
Hello.

04:52.643 --> 04:55.608
Uh, no, I'm Sharona,
his assistant. Who is this?

04:57.157 --> 04:59.939
Oh, uh, hold on.

04:59.974 --> 05:04.017
Adrian.
Adrian, you have a brother?

05:12.269 --> 05:14.951
No.

05:16.459 --> 05:19.700
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong Adrian Monk.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.909
- How old was she?
- Sixty-five.

05:24.696 --> 05:26.421
Don't answer it. Don't...

05:26.456 --> 05:29.087
Just don't answer it.

05:29.122 --> 05:32.087
I... I might have a brother.

05:32.736 --> 05:34.470
You told me you were an only child.

05:34.505 --> 05:37.368
I consider myself an only child.

05:37.403 --> 05:40.795
We're not close.
He... He has issues.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.279
Your brother has issues?

05:42.314 --> 05:44.073
Don't you people have work to do?

05:44.108 --> 05:47.547
There's a dead woman over there.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.137
Ignore it. Just ignore it.

05:54.172 --> 05:57.007
He'll stop... eventually.

05:57.042 --> 06:00.007
He has to sleep.

06:00.892 --> 06:04.000
- What's his name?
- Ambrose.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.952
What does he do?

06:06.987 --> 06:12.202
He writes instruction manuals...
for blenders and toaster ovens.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.029
He lives in Tewkesbury.

06:14.064 --> 06:16.115
- He lives 10 minutes away?
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.208
Well, if you don't pick up the phone,
he's just gonna come over.

06:18.243 --> 06:21.041
No. He can't.
He never leaves the house.

06:21.076 --> 06:24.041
He has agoraphobia.
I told you. He's...

06:25.993 --> 06:27.890
When was the last time you spoke to him?

06:27.925 --> 06:30.890
About four years ago.
Maybe five.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.561
- Was it four or five?
- Six.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.600
Seven. Look...

06:40.635 --> 06:43.080
He didn't come to Trudy's funeral.

06:43.115 --> 06:45.039
But you just said that
he can't leave the house.

06:45.074 --> 06:48.889
He never called or wrote.
Not one word.

06:48.924 --> 06:51.745
- Did you call him?
- Yes! A hundred times.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.442
Never picked up the phone.

06:54.477 --> 06:58.553
- Maybe he's calling to apologize.
- It's too late. I don't need him.

06:58.588 --> 07:01.553
- Well, I think you do.
- Don't! Don't ta...

07:04.241 --> 07:07.241
Hello?
Is this Ambrose?

07:08.639 --> 07:11.639
Hi. Hi. I've heard so much about you.

07:11.973 --> 07:17.354
Yeah. Oh. Oh, okay. Hol...
Just hold on one sec.

07:17.389 --> 07:19.752
He wants you to come right over.
He says it's very important.

07:19.787 --> 07:24.924
- I don't care!
- He says it's life or death.

07:29.076 --> 07:30.765
Wow. This is where you grew up?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.680
Are you surprised?

07:32.715 --> 07:35.680
Nah, I just always pictured
something different.

07:35.868 --> 07:38.349
Like what?

07:38.384 --> 07:42.326
I don't know.
Like a laboratory.

07:46.948 --> 07:48.949
Was that your swing set?

07:48.984 --> 07:51.949
My father put it up when I was eight.

07:52.523 --> 07:55.423
It's probably the happiest day of my life.

07:55.458 --> 07:58.423
- Looked like fun.
- I wouldn't know.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.851
You never used it?

08:00.886 --> 08:03.851
I mean, look at it.
It's a death trap.

08:04.404 --> 08:07.404
But it was fun watching him put it up.

08:08.181 --> 08:09.975
He must have been disappointed.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.539
Well, he was used to it by then.

08:12.574 --> 08:17.421
Two months later, he went out to pick up
some Chinese food, never came back.

08:20.137 --> 08:23.518
Sorry.

08:26.459 --> 08:29.582
Is that him?

08:34.371 --> 08:37.371
- Okay. Let's go.
- What?

08:38.315 --> 08:39.861
I waved at him.
He waved at me.

08:39.897 --> 08:45.573
- That's enough for one decade. - Adrian,
you can't leave. He's your brother.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.338
Come on.

09:05.305 --> 09:11.435
- Hello, Adrian.
- Ambrose.

09:21.468 --> 09:24.468
Uh... This is my assistant, Sharona.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.461
- Oh, hi.
- Hello. We spoke on the phone.

09:27.496 --> 09:30.461
Oh, so, you can dial a telephone.
I was worried.

09:31.479 --> 09:33.111
I thought you might be
paralyzed or something.

09:33.146 --> 09:35.404
- I wasn't paralyzed.
- I was being sarcastic.

09:35.439 --> 09:38.853
You were being sardonic. Sarcasm
is a contemptuous, ironic statement.

09:38.888 --> 09:43.033
You were being mockingly derisive.
That's sardonic.

09:44.456 --> 09:47.953
Please, come in.

09:52.514 --> 09:55.514
Oh, God. You didn't have to
clean up just for us.

09:58.357 --> 10:01.357
- Hey. Did you write this?
- Yes.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.609
I have this answering machine.
This is a very good manual.

10:04.644 --> 10:06.676
All the steps are very clear.

10:06.711 --> 10:09.676
- I'm sure you noticed the typo.
- Uh, no.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.531
It's on page 42.

10:16.427 --> 10:18.427
It should read...

10:20.195 --> 10:23.965
- You wrote the German part too?
- Ambrose can speak seven languages.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.965
Seven and a half.
I'm teaching myself Mandarin.

10:27.401 --> 10:29.996
That'll come in handy.

10:30.031 --> 10:33.731
- Um, here. I picked up your mail for you.
- Thank you.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.731
You know, I really, uh,
like that catalog.

10:36.996 --> 10:38.840
Can I have one?
They sent you two of them.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.050
I'm sorry? No.

10:41.085 --> 10:45.903
- Well, they're identical.
- I save all my mail.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.692
When Dad comes back
he'll want to see his mail.

10:48.727 --> 10:51.818
- Ambrose.
- It'll be all ready for him.

10:51.853 --> 10:53.792
- He's not coming back.
- You don't know.

10:53.827 --> 10:57.357
- Yes, I do.
- You don't know everything!

10:57.392 --> 10:59.685
Mr. Great Detective.!

11:00.393 --> 11:03.393
Why aren't you out there looking for him?

11:04.090 --> 11:07.741
'Cause I'm afraid I might find him.

11:12.778 --> 11:17.972
Uh, Ad... Adrian, is...
is that you in the photo over there?

11:18.389 --> 11:21.389
- Oh. That's me.
- You're not touching.

11:21.433 --> 11:24.433
Actually, that's as close as we ever got.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.207
- Is that your mom?
- Mm-hmm.

11:27.242 --> 11:32.602
- She's beautiful.
- She was. We lost her in 1994.

11:35.482 --> 11:39.461
So, Adrian,
are you still living on Pine Street?

11:39.496 --> 11:41.321
Oh, yeah.
He has a great apartment.

11:41.356 --> 11:44.020
You should come by sometime.

11:44.055 --> 11:47.004
- I can't.
- Ambrose, don't say you can't.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.548
I can't. - Of course you can.
You choose not to.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.929
That's easy for you to say.
You've always been the fearless one.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.943
- Here it comes.
- You should have seen him.

11:55.978 --> 11:57.739
Going into stores and buying things...

11:57.774 --> 12:00.426
- all by himself when he was 15.
- Wow.

12:00.461 --> 12:03.299
Driving a car when he was 24.

12:03.334 --> 12:06.299
Going out on dates...
Going out on dates with women...

12:06.401 --> 12:09.401
at 26 years of age.

12:09.820 --> 12:14.091
- He's a regular Evel Knievel.
- So, anyway, Ambrose.

12:14.126 --> 12:16.993
What am I...
What am I doing here?

12:17.028 --> 12:18.996
Believe it or not, I need your help.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.555
Something happened two nights ago.

12:20.590 --> 12:23.555
It's my next-door neighbor.
His name is Pat Van Ranken.

12:24.740 --> 12:29.854
- What happened?
- I'm 85% to 90% sure he killed his wife.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.816
That's his house.
You can see it out the window.

12:36.851 --> 12:38.882
His wife, Rita, is a friend of mine.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.330
She comes over and
makes me dinner sometimes.

12:41.365 --> 12:43.817
- Is this your old bedroom?
- Mm-hmm.

12:43.852 --> 12:48.768
- Wow. How does it feel to be in here?
- Horrible. Thank you for asking.

12:48.803 --> 12:50.440
- You like The Who?
- The what?

12:50.475 --> 12:53.155
The rock band The Who.
You have the album.

12:53.190 --> 12:58.933
Oh, yeah. All the kids enjoyed
the rock-and-roll singing groups.

12:58.968 --> 13:01.933
- And the 49ers?
- Now they were a great band.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.418
- They're a football team.
- I know.

13:05.453 --> 13:10.007
You were just trying to
fit in, weren't you? - No.

13:10.710 --> 13:14.843
Yes. - This might be the
saddest room I've ever seen.

13:14.878 --> 13:19.401
Anyway, Adrian,
two nights ago I heard them fighting.

13:19.436 --> 13:21.134
- They were really screaming.
- Right.

13:21.169 --> 13:23.354
- Then I heard gunshots.
- Are you sure?

13:23.389 --> 13:26.230
Four shots. It sounded like
a Lane and Westing nine-millimeter.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.506
Lane and Westing doesn't make
a nine-millimeter.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.542
They did until 1992.
I know that gun.

13:31.577 --> 13:35.259
I wrote the manual for it.
Three hours later,

13:35.294 --> 13:39.454
he drove away in his pickup truck.
He was gone all night. - Uh-huh.

13:39.489 --> 13:42.511
The next day I called the house.
Rita wasn't there.

13:42.546 --> 13:44.837
- Pat said she was in Argentina,
- Okay.

13:44.872 --> 13:47.401
Visiting her sister,
which was news to me.

13:47.436 --> 13:49.730
When I mentioned that
I saw him leave, he denied it.

13:49.765 --> 13:51.742
- He said it was impossible.
- Right.

13:51.777 --> 13:54.518
His truck's been broken all summer.

13:54.553 --> 13:57.072
He... He called me a lunatic.

13:57.107 --> 13:59.871
Well.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.964
Did you call the police?

14:01.999 --> 14:04.269
Oh, no. They... They no longer
respond to my complaints...

14:04.304 --> 14:06.453
because I call them
more often than I should.

14:06.488 --> 14:11.166
I'd like to complain to them about it, but
they no longer respond to my complaints.

14:11.201 --> 14:13.084
When was the last time you saw the wife?

14:13.119 --> 14:16.035
Three days ago.
She borrowed a bag of flour.

14:16.070 --> 14:20.993
She was baking pies for the town.
It's their big centennial celebration.

14:21.028 --> 14:25.767
- What do you think, Adrian?
- Yeah, you might be onto something.

14:25.802 --> 14:28.767
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. I'll look into it.

14:30.563 --> 14:33.563
Let's go.

14:33.631 --> 14:38.809
- We'll look into it.
- Gonna look into it.

14:45.033 --> 14:48.192
What... What are you doing?
What... What... What's that for?

14:48.227 --> 14:50.194
For making my family seem normal.

14:50.229 --> 14:52.825
Okay. Okay, okay.

14:52.860 --> 14:56.547
- Are you really gonna look into it?
- No, no. He's delusional.

14:56.582 --> 14:59.547
He is the worst eyewitness in the world.

14:59.923 --> 15:04.373
But he heard gunshots. - Sharona,
the whole town's been celebrating all week.

15:04.408 --> 15:06.934
It was probably some kid
setting off firecrackers.

15:06.969 --> 15:10.019
Well, at least you two were talking again.

15:10.054 --> 15:12.238
I'm glad you enjoyed it,
because that's it.

15:12.273 --> 15:14.707
I am never setting foot
in that house again.

15:14.742 --> 15:16.621
Okay, I have my own problems.

15:16.656 --> 15:18.560
Really? I never noticed.

15:18.595 --> 15:21.438
Now you're being sardonic.

15:26.881 --> 15:30.173
What? What is it?

15:31.309 --> 15:33.409
Van Ranken's pickup.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.277
He told my brother it
hadn't been moved all

15:35.378 --> 15:37.485
summer, but look at the
grass in front of the truck.

15:39.729 --> 15:43.719
It's brown.
The truck's been moved.

15:51.933 --> 15:54.351
Coming.

15:57.027 --> 16:00.084
Coming.

16:00.832 --> 16:02.947
- Mr. Van Ranken?
- That's right.

16:02.982 --> 16:05.947
Yes, hi. I'm Sharona Fleming,
and this is Adrian Monk.

16:06.416 --> 16:12.944
- Monk? From next door?
- No, no. No, no. He's... He's my brother.

16:12.979 --> 16:14.587
You almost gave me a heart attack.

16:14.622 --> 16:19.603
That guy hasn't left the house in,
what, 20 years? - Thirty-two.

16:19.638 --> 16:21.324
My wife knows him.

16:21.359 --> 16:23.704
What is he? Scared of stuff?

16:23.739 --> 16:26.704
Yes. Yes, he's scared of stuff.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.811
Stuff and... and things.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.619
What can I do for ya?

16:31.654 --> 16:34.619
Well, my brother loaned
your wife a bag of flour,

16:35.916 --> 16:39.542
and he sent us over to... to pick it up.

16:39.577 --> 16:43.917
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thanks.

16:45.029 --> 16:46.998
Is your wife here?

16:47.033 --> 16:48.946
No. No, you missed her.

16:48.981 --> 16:51.946
She's in Argentina.
Her sister's sick. - Oh.

16:53.196 --> 16:59.175
We were thinking about doing
some hiking later. Um...

16:59.210 --> 17:03.012
What is that Melvone State Park like?
Is that nice?

17:03.047 --> 17:04.478
It's beautiful.

17:04.512 --> 17:05.757
How'd you know I was up there?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.757
Uh, there's a parking permit
on your pickup truck.

17:08.926 --> 17:12.621
Is that right? - I guess you
couldn't have had too much fun though.

17:12.656 --> 17:17.196
According to the permit you got there
just before closing... 9:43 p. m.?

17:17.232 --> 17:21.910
That's true.
It was a longer drive than I thought.

17:21.944 --> 17:24.910
- Hmm.
- Well, let's find that flour.

17:25.583 --> 17:28.499
Excuse the mess.
I was just cleaning up.

17:28.534 --> 17:31.603
I don't know where she put it.

17:31.638 --> 17:35.313
- Is that a shoe?
- Yeah, it's my wife's.

17:35.348 --> 17:37.188
Guess she decided she didn't like them.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.914
It's funny there's only one.

17:39.949 --> 17:44.816
They...
Usually come in pairs.

17:51.594 --> 17:53.654
What are you doing?

17:53.689 --> 17:57.410
I was just...
just looking for that other shoe.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.161
It must be around here somewhere.

18:03.047 --> 18:05.455
They really should be together.

18:05.490 --> 18:09.248
They're a...
they're a... you know, a pair.

18:09.283 --> 18:10.957
I'm sure it'll turn up.

18:10.992 --> 18:14.075
Well, when it does,
could you give me a call?

18:14.110 --> 18:17.738
Uh, it'd mean a lot to me.

18:17.773 --> 18:20.738
Yeah. I'll do that.

18:22.255 --> 18:24.992
There's the flour.

18:25.027 --> 18:27.992
Thank your brother for me, won't you?

18:28.446 --> 18:30.280
Well, I guess that's it.

18:30.315 --> 18:35.402
- I don't want to keep you.
- Oh, I'm sure you don't.

18:46.999 --> 18:49.594
Whatever happened happened in the kitchen.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.285
He's been bleaching the floor.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.000
And he went to the state park...
maybe to bury something.

18:54.035 --> 18:56.733
Yes. He was parked by
the southern entrance.

18:56.768 --> 19:01.365
- How do you know that? - It's
obvious. Why don't you tell her, Adrian?

19:01.400 --> 19:05.569
- Uh...
- The yellow acorns on his truck,

19:05.604 --> 19:10.394
which can only mean he was parked
under a spotted oak tree. - Wow.

19:10.429 --> 19:13.394
- Which are found?
- Uh...

19:13.923 --> 19:15.605
- Near water.
- Wow.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.362
So that's near the river
by the southern entrance. - Wow.

19:19.397 --> 19:22.362
- Please stop saying "Wow."
- This detective stuff is easy.

19:23.053 --> 19:24.488
Looks like you got a new partner.

19:24.523 --> 19:27.461
Yeah, for any crime committed
within 30 feet of this property.

19:27.496 --> 19:29.465
So, what do we do now?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.465
Well, at this point,
it's just your word against his.

19:33.852 --> 19:36.329
- Hello.
- Where's he goin'?

19:36.364 --> 19:39.790
Let's find out.

19:42.607 --> 19:45.607
Come on.
He's heading downtown.

19:46.378 --> 19:51.535
- Ambrose, come with us.
- Me? No, no, no.

19:51.570 --> 19:54.822
You're just gonna hide in this house
for the rest of your life?

19:54.857 --> 19:56.530
That's my plan, yes.

19:56.565 --> 19:58.883
Come on. Take my hand.

19:58.918 --> 20:00.876
Just to the end of the driveway.

20:00.911 --> 20:03.876
You can do it.
Come on.

20:04.491 --> 20:07.509
Come on.

20:11.862 --> 20:17.541
- Come on.
- I... I can't.

20:19.059 --> 20:20.947
Ambrose, you know what?

20:20.982 --> 20:23.829
Adrian's scared too... all the time.

20:23.864 --> 20:25.918
But he doesn't let that stop him.

20:25.953 --> 20:31.602
Okay, now you tell me,
what does he have that you don't have?

20:31.637 --> 20:34.899
He has you.

20:41.855 --> 20:43.729
He never apologized.
Did you notice that?

20:43.764 --> 20:45.849
Adrian, he's trying his best.
The man's in pain.

20:45.884 --> 20:47.896
Yeah, well, who isn't?

20:47.931 --> 20:51.616
How can somebody not
call for seven years...

20:51.651 --> 20:54.616
and then just act like nothing happened?

20:55.011 --> 20:57.386
Are you gonna stay mad at him forever?

20:57.421 --> 21:00.386
No, not forever.
Just until I die.

21:01.287 --> 21:04.287
Ooh! There he goes.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.022
- Potato sack race?
- Sorry, it's all filled up.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.794
What? No, you can't be.

21:09.829 --> 21:11.251
I have to be in this race.

21:11.286 --> 21:13.135
Here's the thing.
We're all out of sacks.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.704
- What about that one?
- That one's ripped.

21:14.739 --> 21:17.704
I don't care. I'll take it.

21:19.063 --> 21:22.063
Racers, grab your potato sack.

21:22.188 --> 21:25.188
On your mark, get set, go.!

21:39.345 --> 21:42.007
Hey!

21:42.042 --> 21:43.688
What's he doing?

21:43.723 --> 21:47.736
He's trying to win that radio.

22:22.198 --> 22:29.131
First prize is this brand-new stereo
boom box. Here you go, sweetheart.

22:32.487 --> 22:35.487
Uh, we're gonna get you a new one.

22:36.168 --> 22:41.542
Uh, and the second prize...
is this delicious homemade cherry pie.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.934
- Who came in second?
- Right here.

22:43.969 --> 22:47.000
Here you go, sir.
Bon appetit.

23:09.046 --> 23:13.034
- What's he doing?
- He's looking for something.

23:13.069 --> 23:16.169
That's why he tripped.
He didn't want to win the race.

23:16.204 --> 23:18.645
He was trying to come in second.
He wanted the pie.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.645
- Why?
- Well, obviously, he...

23:25.528 --> 23:28.528
You see, Sharona,
what happened was...

23:32.940 --> 23:38.382
I have no idea.

23:40.531 --> 23:42.539
I guess he didn't like the pie.

23:42.574 --> 23:48.470
- He was looking for something.
- Something inside the pie?

23:48.505 --> 23:52.255
- Wait a minute. Cherry pie.
- Yes, cherry pie.

23:52.290 --> 23:55.155
- Cherry pie. Cherry pie. - Cherry.
It's cherry! You can see it's cherry!

23:55.190 --> 24:01.134
There was something about a cherry pie
in the paper... three days ago.

24:09.043 --> 24:12.471
- What is this?
- Every newspaper since 1972.

24:12.506 --> 24:15.471
- Oh.
- I am as God made me.

24:16.447 --> 24:18.479
It's only three days ago.

24:18.514 --> 24:21.605
- Wouldn't it be near the top?
- I have my own system.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.605
- What system is that?
- You wouldn't understand.

24:25.979 --> 24:31.107
Ah! Ah! Here it is.
Here it is.

24:31.142 --> 24:34.107
Right here. Here.

24:35.316 --> 24:38.316
- The carjacking?
- Oh, my God. We were there, remember?

24:38.417 --> 24:41.997
- Yeah, I know.
- Doesn't that label say "cherry pie"?

24:42.032 --> 24:46.495
Yes, it does. It says "cherry pie."
How did you remember that?

24:46.530 --> 24:49.495
It's a gift... and a curse.

24:49.810 --> 24:52.810
- Oh, my God. Adrian, this is... - Wait
a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.705
Wait a minute.

24:58.547 --> 25:01.547
I think she was killed for a pie.

25:01.780 --> 25:08.331
- So, this is where you guys grew up, huh?
- That's right.

25:08.366 --> 25:11.316
- What's with the filing cabinets?
- Mail.

25:11.351 --> 25:14.221
- Mail?
- Thirty years' worth of mail.

25:14.256 --> 25:17.314
Okay. That makes sense.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.911
- Not to me, but...
- So, Captain,

25:18.946 --> 25:20.654
- Yeah?
- What do you... what do you think?

25:20.689 --> 25:24.394
- About your pie theory?
- Right. The wife baked three pies...

25:24.429 --> 25:28.560
cherry pies... for charity. They've been
giving them away all weekend. - Mm-hmm.

25:28.595 --> 25:32.038
Yeah. There's something in them,
or something inside one of them.

25:32.073 --> 25:37.216
- Something worth killing for. - Captain.
I... I have your coffee, Captain.

25:37.251 --> 25:40.216
Thank you.
Why is it numbered?

25:40.591 --> 25:44.498
- Mother numbered all the mugs. - So we'd
always put them back in the right order.

25:44.533 --> 25:46.648
Of course she did.

25:46.683 --> 25:49.648
- What did she do if a mug got broken?
- What?

25:50.173 --> 25:51.479
What happened if a mug got broken?

25:51.580 --> 25:53.245
Number nine. It slipped.
I couldn't help it.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.537
- Ambrose, not now.
- It was not my fault.

25:55.572 --> 25:57.805
- I'm sorry.
- It was not my fault.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.943
- Did you look at the crime scene photos?
- Yes, I did.

25:59.978 --> 26:02.990
And? - And you're right.
There was no pie. But I...

26:03.025 --> 26:06.416
I like to have more than lack of pie
when I go to the grand jury.

26:06.451 --> 26:08.546
- Does he own a gun?
- Yes, he does.

26:08.581 --> 26:10.432
- Nine-millimeter?
- Yes, it is.

26:10.467 --> 26:15.114
But he is a retired army sergeant,
and most veterans have guns.

26:15.149 --> 26:17.432
Plus he lied about his pickup truck.

26:17.467 --> 26:20.308
- And the one shoe in the garbage.
- His wife is missing.

26:20.343 --> 26:22.725
You want to talk about facts?
Here's a fact for you.

26:22.760 --> 26:27.242
On Thursday night,
Van Ranken's wife flew to Buenos Aires.

26:27.277 --> 26:28.587
I checked with the airline.

26:28.622 --> 26:31.693
She purchased the ticket personally,
and she boarded the plane.

26:31.728 --> 26:36.912
Well, it might have been a girlfriend...
with a fake I. D.

26:36.947 --> 26:40.278
Yes, he... he was
definitely fooling around.

26:40.313 --> 26:43.776
I... I saw him in the backyard,
making phone calls on his cell phone.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.300
- There you go.
- Is that it?

26:46.335 --> 26:48.808
Is that it?

26:48.843 --> 26:51.650
You're leaving? - Yes, I have to go.
Look, I'll sniff around.

26:51.685 --> 26:54.045
That's all I can do without
real evidence. - Captain...

26:54.080 --> 26:56.707
Look... Ambrose, it was a pleasure
meeting you. - Yes.

26:56.742 --> 27:00.286
It certainly answered a few questions,
but it raised about a hundred more.

27:00.321 --> 27:03.709
Here. That goes between five and seven.
I'll see myself out.

27:03.744 --> 27:05.070
- Listen to me.
- Monk.

27:05.105 --> 27:06.847
- Wait a second.
- I'm late for dinner.

27:06.882 --> 27:07.824
- Call me tomorrow.
- Wait.

27:07.859 --> 27:10.824
- Bye, Captain.
- Bye-bye.!

27:11.383 --> 27:12.463
Oh, my God.!
Oh, my God.!

27:12.498 --> 27:14.623
You guys, look at this.
Look at this.

27:14.658 --> 27:17.801
Here's the schedule for all the
charity events with a list of prizes.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.930
There are three homemade pies
being given away.

27:19.965 --> 27:22.185
At the raffle,
the potato sack race...

27:22.220 --> 27:25.415
- And number three?
- They're giving it away tomorrow.

27:25.450 --> 27:28.415
- You play bingo?
- No.

27:28.422 --> 27:31.106
- Is it fun?
- It's a lot of fun.

27:31.141 --> 27:33.859
You're gonna hate it.

27:35.867 --> 27:38.867
And our next number is...

27:40.242 --> 27:42.228
- G-47.
- Oh.!

27:42.263 --> 27:45.228
G-47.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.936
Sharona, look who's here.

27:47.971 --> 27:50.936
What a small world.
Let's sit here.

27:51.516 --> 27:56.252
N-39.
N-39.

27:59.053 --> 28:04.426
B-7.
B-7.

28:04.461 --> 28:07.426
You want to rub my lucky troll?
It's good luck.

28:07.737 --> 28:11.217
- Uh, no, thank you.
- N-39.

28:11.252 --> 28:14.082
- Go ahead. Rub the troll.
- N-39.

28:14.117 --> 28:18.293
No, thank you.
Uh, I've been rubbing trolls all day.

28:18.328 --> 28:22.683
If you don't rub the troll,
it is bad karma.

28:22.718 --> 28:25.138
- Adrian, just rub the man's troll.
- I don't want to rub the troll.

28:25.173 --> 28:27.637
He's never gonna shut up
if you don't rub his troll.

28:27.672 --> 28:31.709
O-73.
O-73.

28:31.744 --> 28:34.114
What are you doing?
Not so hard.

28:34.149 --> 28:35.796
What the hell are you doing?

28:35.831 --> 28:40.702
And our next number is G-56.

28:40.737 --> 28:43.702
- G-five-six.
- You don't have anything.

28:43.935 --> 28:47.312
I'm doing great.
I'm only two away on this one.

28:47.347 --> 28:50.044
Where's your markers?
I don't need them.

28:50.079 --> 28:53.044
And our next number is...

28:54.235 --> 28:58.630
O-68.
O-68.

29:00.751 --> 29:03.157
I-21.

29:03.192 --> 29:04.150
- One more.
- Okay.

29:04.185 --> 29:07.150
I-21.

29:23.559 --> 29:28.741
O-72.

29:31.626 --> 29:34.347
O...

29:34.382 --> 29:37.347
seven...

29:37.641 --> 29:40.641
- two.
- Bingo!

29:42.586 --> 29:45.586
- Bingo!
- We have another winner.

29:46.206 --> 29:49.206
I'll save you a piece.

29:55.416 --> 29:58.206
Sharona, are you sure
you called the captain?

29:58.241 --> 30:00.521
Yeah.

30:00.556 --> 30:02.855
I know what Van Ranken's been looking for.

30:02.890 --> 30:05.855
I know what's in that pie.

30:10.104 --> 30:12.063
Captain.! Captain.!
Captain, here.!

30:12.098 --> 30:15.640
He's trying... He's...
He's trying to get rid of the evidence!

30:15.675 --> 30:17.155
It's in the pie!

30:17.190 --> 30:19.673
Officer, I'd like to file a complaint.

30:19.708 --> 30:21.760
These two have been
harassing me all weekend.

30:21.795 --> 30:24.216
Sir, could you put the pie on the truck?

30:24.251 --> 30:25.681
- What?
- You heard me.

30:25.716 --> 30:28.783
Put the pie down and step away.
Step away from the pie.

30:28.818 --> 30:31.257
Look, I live next door to his brother.
They're both nuts.

30:31.292 --> 30:34.448
I know they are, sir.
Please, put the pie on the truck.

30:34.483 --> 30:37.448
Please.

30:40.700 --> 30:45.154
- Monk.
- Okay, here's what I think happened.

30:45.189 --> 30:48.154
Last Thursday, Rita was baking
three pies for the town centennial.

30:49.100 --> 30:52.881
- She probably put them on the counter
to cool. - Get your hands off...

30:52.916 --> 30:55.695
Her husband came home.
They had a fight.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.063
Maybe Pat was threatening to leave.
Who knows?

30:58.098 --> 30:59.823
But there was a struggle.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.823
My brother said he heard four shots
from a nine-millimeter pistol.

31:03.383 --> 31:08.471
If that's true, the shells
were ejected from the gun as he fired.

31:08.506 --> 31:11.029
They must have gone flying
all over the kitchen.

31:11.064 --> 31:14.029
At some point, he was interrupted.

31:14.567 --> 31:17.921
It was someone from the town
coming by to collect the pies.

31:17.956 --> 31:20.071
Hi. The pies, right?

31:20.106 --> 31:23.928
Okay, just wait one second.
I'll get 'em. Wait here.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.120
Bye.

31:32.776 --> 31:35.776
Later, when he started
cleaning up the kitchen,

31:36.416 --> 31:39.416
he got the shock of his life.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.647
One shell casing was missing.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.343
The gun is registered,
so if anyone had found that casing,

31:54.378 --> 31:56.268
it would have been easily traced.

31:56.303 --> 32:00.194
It wasn't in pie number
one or pie number two.

32:00.229 --> 32:02.545
It has to be in here.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.943
Mr. Van Ranken,
we'd like permission to search your pie.

32:05.978 --> 32:07.122
What?

32:07.157 --> 32:09.254
Please don't make me say that again.

32:09.289 --> 32:12.245
- What if I say no? - Then we
hold you here as a material witness...

32:12.280 --> 32:14.807
until we get a search warrant.

32:14.842 --> 32:17.807
- For a pie?
- For a pie.

32:23.825 --> 32:26.825
Sharona, would you do the honors?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.762
Actually, this is one of my fantasies.

32:41.797 --> 32:44.762
Except it's not a pie,
and you're not in it.

32:45.351 --> 32:48.351
Will you shut up?

32:54.090 --> 32:56.874
Well?

32:56.909 --> 32:58.751
- It's... It's not in here. I...
- What?

32:58.786 --> 33:02.089
Right... Right...
Right there, right? Sharona?

33:02.124 --> 33:08.871
- Adrian, it's not in here.
- But... But, Sharona...

33:08.906 --> 33:12.871
Mr. Van Ranken,
the department would, uh, like to a...

33:14.551 --> 33:17.501
We'd like to buy you a new pie.

33:17.536 --> 33:19.315
I don't understand.

33:19.350 --> 33:23.404
Usually when he does the whole
summation thing it's all over, right?

33:23.439 --> 33:25.840
We get to go home.

33:25.875 --> 33:28.420
What is with you and these cherry pies?

33:28.455 --> 33:29.891
Uh, Captain, look, I-I'm telling you...

33:29.926 --> 33:33.266
Monk, what is this? Some kind of sibling
rivalry thing between you and your brother?

33:33.301 --> 33:35.305
No. No, no, no.
No. No, no. Look.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.371
Don't call us. We'll call you.

33:37.406 --> 33:40.371
Lieutenant, get in the car.

33:53.581 --> 33:57.581
- So the pie was empty?
- That's right.

34:01.810 --> 34:06.810
Is that it?
Just gonna give up?

34:07.223 --> 34:10.223
There's nothing else I can do.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.051
Well, thanks for believing me.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.051
Or at least pretending to.

34:18.875 --> 34:21.875
- You going to stay?
- No. I can't. Uh...

34:23.821 --> 34:27.934
I made... I made Dad's favorite...
uh, pasta primavera.

34:27.969 --> 34:30.216
- Ambrose, I... I... I have to go.
- Wait.

34:30.251 --> 34:34.877
Sharona's waiting.

34:41.148 --> 34:43.626
He's not coming back.

34:43.661 --> 34:47.626
You're probably right,
but just in case.

34:49.284 --> 34:51.005
Maybe I'll see you, uh, next week.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.748
I don't think so.
Take care of yourself.

34:54.783 --> 34:57.748
I love you.

34:58.122 --> 35:03.087
Don't...
say that.

35:03.122 --> 35:06.087
Don't you say that.

35:06.827 --> 35:09.238
I'm no expert, but I know that
people who love each other...

35:09.273 --> 35:12.978
who care about each other...
don't go seven years without calling.

35:13.013 --> 35:17.577
Especially when I needed you most...
after Trudy.

35:17.612 --> 35:22.970
- You think I didn't c-call because
I didn't care? - Then why?

35:23.005 --> 35:25.970
What happened to you?

35:26.018 --> 35:28.558
Do you know why Trudy was in that...

35:28.593 --> 35:31.558
parking garage on the day she died?

35:32.381 --> 35:35.381
What are you saying?

35:36.062 --> 35:39.062
It was because of me.

35:40.088 --> 35:46.462
- You?
- She was doing me... a favor.

35:46.497 --> 35:49.229
I needed cough medicine.
I called her.

35:49.264 --> 35:51.110
- I asked her to go...
- Oh, my God.

35:51.145 --> 35:53.609
- To the drugstore for me.
- Don't do this.

35:53.644 --> 35:57.556
She wouldn't have been in that garage
if it wasn't for me. - Oh, Ambrose.

35:57.591 --> 36:00.482
It was me, Adrian!
It was me. It was my fault!

36:00.517 --> 36:01.683
No, no.
No, no, no.

36:01.718 --> 36:05.375
- Adrian, it was my fault!
- No, it was not your fault.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.565
- Adrian, I'm...
- No, you couldn't...

36:07.600 --> 36:09.920
- I'm sorry, Adrian.
- It was not your fault.

36:09.955 --> 36:11.963
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God, no.

36:11.998 --> 36:14.031
Don't. No, no, no. Don't.
It was not...

36:14.066 --> 36:17.031
- Adrian, it was my fault.
- It was not...

36:18.342 --> 36:21.342
- It was not your fault.
- Adiran

36:22.707 --> 36:25.707
- No, no, no. Shh.
- I'm sorry.

36:25.794 --> 36:28.501
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

36:28.536 --> 36:31.501
It was not your fault.

36:32.141 --> 36:35.141
Okay, so, I'm here.
She's over here.

36:35.692 --> 36:37.616
"Where do you think you're going?"

36:37.651 --> 36:40.582
Okay, you're Rita,
and you're making three pies.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.059
You're taking them out of the oven.

36:42.094 --> 36:44.952
She grabs the knife, right?

36:44.987 --> 36:48.037
"Rita, don't be stupid.
I'm warning you."

36:48.072 --> 36:49.310
No. No, not there.

36:49.345 --> 36:51.643
That's where she kept the flour, remember?

36:51.678 --> 36:54.567
"Don't make me do it.
Don't make me do something..."

36:54.602 --> 36:57.033
- "...I'm going to regret."
- Bam, bam, bam, bam!

36:57.068 --> 37:01.000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

37:25.690 --> 37:28.690
Ambrose.

37:34.962 --> 37:38.560
Hi. I'm Pat Van Ranken from next door.

37:38.595 --> 37:41.220
You loaned my wife a
bag of flour, remember?

37:41.255 --> 37:43.453
I wonder if I could borrow it back.

37:43.488 --> 37:46.453
- Borrow it back?
- Yeah, I'm makin' chili.

37:46.767 --> 37:49.551
You don't use flour to make chili.

37:49.586 --> 37:53.253
Open the door.
Open the door.!

37:53.288 --> 37:56.253
Open the door.! Open it.!

38:03.055 --> 38:06.055
Hello?

38:06.511 --> 38:09.511
The line's dead.

38:29.767 --> 38:32.580
Okay, we'll meet you there.
The captain's on his way.

38:32.615 --> 38:37.317
Can't you go any faster? - Faster?
Oh, my God. You must be really worried.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.464
Oh, God, no.

39:07.499 --> 39:10.464
Call... Call the fire department.
Call 911.

39:11.184 --> 39:13.873
Adrian, what are you doing?
Adrian, where are you going?

39:13.908 --> 39:15.085
He's still in there!

39:15.120 --> 39:18.085
- How do you know?
- Sharona, he can't leave!

39:19.067 --> 39:22.067
Ambrose!

39:22.683 --> 39:26.456
Ambrose!
Ambrose.

39:26.491 --> 39:29.324
- Adrian.
- Ambrose!

39:29.359 --> 39:32.777
- Adrian.
- Ambrose, we've gotta get out of here!

39:32.812 --> 39:35.186
- I can't... I can't find number eight.
- No. What?

39:35.221 --> 39:37.644
I can't find number eight.
Where's number eight?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.112
Forget about the mugs!

39:39.147 --> 39:41.902
Get your hands up.!
Van Ranken.!

39:41.937 --> 39:43.277
Thank God you guys are here.

39:43.312 --> 39:45.382
- I saw the smoke.
- Put your hands on your head.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.777
Hands on your head!

39:47.812 --> 39:50.559
Turn around.
Turn around.

39:50.594 --> 39:52.665
You might be interested to know
we just found your wife's body

39:52.700 --> 39:55.142
20 minutes ago in the state park.

39:55.177 --> 39:56.355
Can't wait to meet your girlfriend.

39:56.390 --> 40:00.023
When does she get back from...
Where is it? Argentina? Come on.

40:00.058 --> 40:02.016
- Come on!
- No.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.207
- Come on, Ambrose!
- I can't.

40:04.242 --> 40:07.152
- You... You go.
- I need you. I need you.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.809
- I can't.
- I can't lose you.

40:09.844 --> 40:14.809
- You go. You go.
- Ambrose, please, for Trudy's sake.

40:28.222 --> 40:31.222
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

40:32.129 --> 40:36.129
I can't believe you went in.
I... I can't believe you came out.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.869
- I'm out?
- Let's go.! Get the pressure up.!

40:41.228 --> 40:44.228
You're outside.

40:44.906 --> 40:47.906
You're outside.

40:48.485 --> 40:51.485
I'm outside.

40:51.739 --> 40:55.000
Adrian, I'm outside.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.787
I knew you could do it.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.583
My brother brought me outside.

41:04.528 --> 41:07.528
Yeah, he did.

41:10.537 --> 41:15.067
I think...
you've been looking for this.

41:17.953 --> 41:21.191
He brought me outside.
I'm outside.

41:22.634 --> 41:25.634
Yes, you are.

41:31.988 --> 41:34.988
You'll never guess who's here.

41:36.446 --> 41:39.446
Go ahead. Try to guess.

41:42.513 --> 41:45.513
Give up?

42:03.890 --> 42:06.890
Okay?

42:08.675 --> 42:10.723
Can I go home now?

42:10.758 --> 42:13.573
You want to stop and grab
a bite first somewhere?

42:13.608 --> 42:16.618
I think I'd rather just go home.

42:16.653 --> 42:19.618
Yeah, I thought you might.

42:24.039 --> 42:27.039
Would you like to help me clean up?

42:28.596 --> 42:31.596
I thought you'd never ask.

42:32.465 --> 42:35.465
Maybe we could start with the living room.
