WEBVTT

00:08.798 --> 00:09.906
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:09.907 --> 00:14.012
Okay! You're right on time for the
first official team Austin...

00:14.013 --> 00:15.470
And team Ally meeting.

00:15.471 --> 00:18.406
Our little girl's
stepping out on her own.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.567
One sec.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.716
Ally, it seems like only
yesterday we were standing here

00:24.717 --> 00:27.315
picking up the pieces of
the cello Dez and I broke.

00:27.316 --> 00:29.114
That was yesterday.

00:29.115 --> 00:32.101
And you still owe
me $300 for it.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.309
Let's not live in the past.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.258
How about we get this
meeting started?

00:37.259 --> 00:40.361
- Who are you gonna talk about first?
- We've worked out a system for that.

00:40.362 --> 00:46.101
Dez is going to shoot a violin bow
and drumstick arrow at a target.

00:46.102 --> 00:48.202
Observe.

00:51.102 --> 00:53.170
And I'll do it blindfolded.

00:53.171 --> 00:57.791
So you don't think I'm
playing favorites.

01:01.846 --> 01:04.048
Let's just talk
about Austin first.

01:04.049 --> 01:06.082
Austin it is.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.952
Austin, you asked me to
book rehearsal space,

01:08.953 --> 01:11.664
schedule a photo shoot
and update your website.

01:11.665 --> 01:16.960
I'm happy to report that all those
things are officially on my to-do list.

01:16.961 --> 01:19.560
Well, I'm officially...

01:19.561 --> 01:21.998
Okay with that.

01:21.999 --> 01:26.937
And Ally, I spoke to Jimmy Starr
about getting you a record deal.

01:26.938 --> 01:29.973
I'm sorry, but he doesn't think
it's a good idea to sign you.

01:29.974 --> 01:33.536
Well, that no-good hack wouldn't know
talent if it hit him over the head!

01:33.537 --> 01:35.345
He signed me.

01:35.346 --> 01:38.849
That guy knows what he's doing.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.585
He thinks Ally's talented.

01:40.586 --> 01:44.054
He just doesn't think she and Austin
should be signed to the same record label.

01:44.055 --> 01:45.677
I guess that makes sense.

01:45.678 --> 01:48.091
We shouldn't be competing
for Jimmy's attention.

01:48.092 --> 01:49.960
I'm really sorry, Ally.

01:49.961 --> 01:51.645
We'll come up with something.

01:51.646 --> 01:53.063
Already figured it out.

01:53.064 --> 01:55.416
I got Ally an audition
to perform at a concert,

01:55.417 --> 01:57.538
for some other
big-name record execs!

01:57.539 --> 01:59.069
- Oh my God!
- Yes!

01:59.070 --> 02:01.414
Seriously?! That's
amazing, Trish!

02:01.415 --> 02:04.090
The audition's tomorrow,
so be ready to wow them.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.646
If you really wanna wow them,
you need two things...

02:06.647 --> 02:09.245
The best Ally you can be...

02:09.246 --> 02:12.366
And a boxing kangaroo!

02:12.851 --> 02:15.497
How is that gonna help
me with the audition?

02:15.498 --> 02:20.538
I don't know. But I
guarantee you'll wow them.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.818
Wow.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.342
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:29.343 --> 02:32.477
<i>♪ 'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:32.478 --> 02:34.009
<i>♪ You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:34.010 --> 02:35.628
<i>♪ You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:35.629 --> 02:38.673
<i>♪ And I see our names
together on every billboard.</i>

02:38.674 --> 02:41.732
<i>♪ We're headed for the
top, we've got it on lock.</i>

02:41.733 --> 02:43.346
<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:43.347 --> 02:45.669
<i>♪ And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:45.670 --> 02:49.807
<i>♪ Oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya.</i>

02:49.808 --> 02:52.843
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:52.844 --> 02:55.913
<i>♪ It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:55.914 --> 02:59.236
<i>♪ With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:59.237 --> 03:01.886
<i>♪ I own this dream.</i>

03:01.887 --> 03:05.264
<i>♪ 'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:05.265 --> 03:08.382
<i>♪ There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:08.383 --> 03:12.823
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:20.714 --> 03:26.614
Okay, the key to an audition is to
have confidence, flavor and swag.

03:27.377 --> 03:31.358
I'm not sure what two of those words
mean, so I'll focus on the confidence.

03:31.359 --> 03:34.119
You walk in the room,
pop your collar...

03:34.120 --> 03:35.952
Don't have a collar, so
just walk in the room.

03:35.953 --> 03:39.305
Sing your song, bust out
a cool dance move...

03:39.306 --> 03:43.266
And leave like you
own the place.

03:43.483 --> 03:45.353
Oh yeah.

03:45.354 --> 03:48.174
So I'll sing, then leave.

03:48.175 --> 03:52.043
I don't know, Austin. I think
I gotta do this my way.

03:52.044 --> 03:53.621
I just have to figure
out what to sing.

03:53.622 --> 03:55.961
Well, I thought you could
sing a song you wrote for me.

03:55.962 --> 03:58.998
But I couldn't pick one, so I
figured why not sing all of them?

03:58.999 --> 04:01.339
Here, look.

04:01.702 --> 04:03.969
The audition's only
two minutes long.

04:03.970 --> 04:06.511
Right, so you gotta do it fast.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.776
When you hear the
buzzer, switch songs.

04:09.777 --> 04:14.097
<i>And don't look down down.
Down down...</i>

04:14.335 --> 04:17.345
<i>I love the things you do...</i>

04:17.346 --> 04:19.709
<i>I can get your heart
beat beat beat...</i>

04:19.711 --> 04:21.411
<i>Na na na...</i>

04:21.411 --> 04:22.200
<i>Nobody...</i>

04:22.201 --> 04:25.501
Okay, this is ridiculous.

04:29.422 --> 04:31.964
Oh, man. Ally's got a lot
of competition here.

04:31.965 --> 04:36.398
Then I guess it's time to
start psyching them out.

04:36.399 --> 04:37.674
Oh!

04:37.675 --> 04:39.806
Do not go in there.

04:39.807 --> 04:43.340
The producers tore me to shreds.

04:43.341 --> 04:45.266
And trust me...

04:45.267 --> 04:47.605
I'm brilliant.

04:47.606 --> 04:52.706
If I can't make it, none
of you have a chance.

04:54.647 --> 04:59.087
And just like that,
I'm in their heads.

05:04.965 --> 05:06.381
Sounds good, Dez.

05:06.382 --> 05:08.409
But I'm pretty sure they're
only auditioning girls.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.630
No. Look.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:19.135 --> 05:21.715
She's perfect.

05:23.092 --> 05:25.672
I'm going in.

05:26.253 --> 05:28.473
Hydrating?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.140
Me too.

05:30.141 --> 05:32.973
I find water as one of
nature's little gifts.

05:32.974 --> 05:35.986
They say to drink six to
eight glasses a day...

05:35.987 --> 05:38.387
I drink 12.

05:45.939 --> 05:48.339
I love you.

05:53.647 --> 05:55.233
- Well?
- Did you get it?

05:55.234 --> 05:58.785
- How'd it go?
- I don't know. It felt really good.

05:58.786 --> 06:01.024
Attention, girls.

06:01.025 --> 06:03.470
If I were in charge,
I'd pick all of you.

06:03.471 --> 06:08.728
Well, that's a lie. I am in charge
and I'm only picking one of you.

06:08.729 --> 06:11.129
Ally Dawson!

06:13.867 --> 06:16.194
Oh! Thanks so much, Val.

06:16.195 --> 06:18.604
I can't wait to write a
new song for the concert.

06:18.605 --> 06:20.873
Oh, hon'. That's not necessary.

06:20.874 --> 06:25.845
I know you write songs for Austin but,
I write all the songs for the group.

06:25.846 --> 06:27.363
Group?

06:27.364 --> 06:30.650
Wait, I thought you were
looking for a solo performer.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.291
- Nope.
- Oops.

06:33.325 --> 06:36.823
Here is your official cat ears,
your tail, a flea collar,

06:36.824 --> 06:38.572
and some standard release forms.

06:38.573 --> 06:42.662
Congrats. You're the third
member of The Stray Kitties.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.723
Here's Country Kitty.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.573
Meow!

06:47.574 --> 06:49.446
And Glamour Kitty.

06:49.447 --> 06:51.367
Meow.

06:51.605 --> 06:53.645
Me-ow.

06:54.212 --> 06:56.943
Welcome to the group, girl.

06:56.944 --> 06:58.043
Kitties.

06:58.044 --> 06:59.964
Meow.

07:01.467 --> 07:03.620
Here, Kitty Kitty.
Come on, Kitty.

07:03.621 --> 07:07.401
Pretty Kitty, come on. Come on.

07:13.766 --> 07:18.271
Girls, I give you the newest
member of The Stray Kitties.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.732
Wicked Kitty!

07:26.633 --> 07:29.702
Val, don't you think her smoky
eyes will distract from mine?

07:29.703 --> 07:31.988
And too much makeup is my thing.

07:31.989 --> 07:33.893
I thought your thing
was bad dancing?

07:33.894 --> 07:37.932
Girls! Remember, we're
Kitties, not catty.

07:37.933 --> 07:41.473
So Ally, what do you think?

07:41.681 --> 07:45.188
I don't know. This look
isn't who I am at all.

07:45.189 --> 07:48.549
I know. Isn't it great?!

07:49.765 --> 07:52.524
Greaty great great.

07:52.525 --> 07:55.694
Anyway Val, I've spent the last
four hours in hair and makeup,

07:55.695 --> 07:58.335
and no one's even mentioned
what song we're singing yet.

07:58.336 --> 08:01.667
It's not about the song. It's
all about the spectacle.

08:01.668 --> 08:04.826
Example... our song is
called "pillow fight".

08:04.827 --> 08:07.639
So I am picturing
lots and lots...

08:07.640 --> 08:10.040
Of feathers!

08:13.447 --> 08:15.514
All right. Let's
start rehearsing.

08:15.515 --> 08:19.341
Uh, the music starts, explosion,
explosion, explosion.

08:19.342 --> 08:22.260
Lights up and boom... opening poses.
Show me!

08:22.261 --> 08:24.781
Country Kitty!

08:25.558 --> 08:27.480
- Meow.
- Yee-haw!

08:27.481 --> 08:29.933
Glamour Kitty.

08:29.934 --> 08:32.111
- Meow.
- Oh, so chic.

08:32.113 --> 08:36.732
And Wicked Kitty! Give
me something fierce!

08:37.537 --> 08:39.457
Meow!

08:40.947 --> 08:43.606
We'll fix that later!
Now the dancing!

08:43.607 --> 08:47.807
Ally, just watch what they do.
Music!

08:50.517 --> 08:53.172
Whenever you feel
comfortable, just join in.

08:53.173 --> 08:54.941
Thanks, I really
appreciate that.

08:54.942 --> 08:58.122
- Join in!
- Oh! Um...

09:01.082 --> 09:03.297
- You're in my spot.
- Oh, sorry. I didn't know.

09:03.298 --> 09:05.327
- Now you're in my spot.
- Oh! Oh!

09:05.328 --> 09:08.028
Pillows! Pillows!

09:16.140 --> 09:18.900
- Ow!
- Cut cut!

09:18.988 --> 09:21.928
Oh! I am so sorry!

09:23.186 --> 09:26.251
Val, this just ain't working.
We don't need Wicked Kitty.

09:26.252 --> 09:27.686
Why can't it just
be the two of us?

09:27.687 --> 09:30.975
I'll take center stage, and then Glamour
Kitty will be my backup dancer.

09:30.976 --> 09:34.526
Backup dancer? I think it's
obvious who the lead is.

09:34.527 --> 09:36.023
- Me.
- No. It's me.

09:36.024 --> 09:37.824
Ha!

09:38.202 --> 09:39.975
I've always been number one!

09:39.976 --> 09:42.434
Girls! Girls!

09:42.435 --> 09:44.277
We're all stars here.

09:44.278 --> 09:46.360
There's no "I" in "Kitties".

09:46.361 --> 09:48.960
Actually, there are two.

09:48.961 --> 09:51.421
And... lunch!

09:57.727 --> 09:59.628
Austin, I cracked it!

09:59.629 --> 10:00.862
Another cello?

10:00.863 --> 10:03.483
We still owe Ally money for
the first one we broke.

10:03.484 --> 10:06.336
No. Well, yes. I did
break another one.

10:06.337 --> 10:09.985
But no! I finally came up with a
way to win over Glamour Kitty.

10:09.986 --> 10:11.263
She's glamorous.

10:11.264 --> 10:16.287
So if I'm gonna win her heart,
I gotta up my glam factor.

10:16.288 --> 10:18.154
- What does that mean?
- Not a clue.

10:18.155 --> 10:21.650
If you wanna win her over,
you gotta have swagger.

10:21.651 --> 10:23.852
You gotta be suave.

10:23.853 --> 10:26.793
Teach me your ways.

10:28.825 --> 10:31.585
Watch The Master.

10:36.866 --> 10:39.926
Looking for something?

10:46.230 --> 10:48.870
I can do that.

10:53.074 --> 10:56.134
Looking for something?

11:05.168 --> 11:08.948
I think they give free refills.

11:11.958 --> 11:15.878
You know what? I have a better
idea to win over Glamour Kitty.

11:15.879 --> 11:19.407
Just dress nice and buy
her something expensive.

11:19.408 --> 11:22.828
And stay away from straws.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.590
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

11:35.591 --> 11:37.253
Who are you?

11:37.254 --> 11:39.429
The better question is...

11:39.430 --> 11:42.070
Whom aren't I?

11:43.166 --> 11:46.493
- I don't understand.
- The name's Dez.

11:46.494 --> 11:48.076
Just Dez.

11:48.077 --> 11:51.191
Well, just Dez, you can
call me Glamour Kitty.

11:51.192 --> 11:53.037
I don't have much time.

11:53.038 --> 11:56.278
I have a lot of important,
mysterious business to attend to.

11:56.279 --> 12:00.682
But I wanted to say,
I've seen you around...

12:00.683 --> 12:02.262
And I like what I see.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.585
Oh, really?

12:03.586 --> 12:05.329
Do you see anything...

12:05.330 --> 12:07.550
You like?

12:10.092 --> 12:12.132
Me-ow.

12:13.763 --> 12:16.832
There's a gift receipt
in the box...

12:16.833 --> 12:20.193
If you wanna exchange it.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.524
<i>Meow ow ow.</i>

12:32.719 --> 12:34.038
<i>That spells pillow fight.</i>

12:34.039 --> 12:37.519
<i>No no no no. Boys allowed.</i>

12:37.653 --> 12:41.368
<i>I'll hit you with my
goose down pillow.</i>

12:41.369 --> 12:42.891
<i>Yeah yeah yeah!</i>

12:42.892 --> 12:44.826
<i>We'll be super loud.</i>

12:44.827 --> 12:48.830
<i>My cactus pillow. Will
make you say "ow".</i>

12:48.831 --> 12:52.438
<i>Oh oh oh. All the
issues will work out.</i>

12:52.439 --> 12:57.539
<i>I'll smack your face. With
my leather pillowcase.</i>

12:58.126 --> 12:59.622
Bravo, Kitties!

12:59.623 --> 13:01.903
Bravo! Oh!

13:02.272 --> 13:05.747
- That was horrible, right?
- It wasn't that bad.

13:05.748 --> 13:08.784
- It was nice and loud.
- Your lips are all... dark?

13:08.785 --> 13:10.786
Glamour Kitty had her moments.

13:10.787 --> 13:12.788
Oh! It stunk!

13:12.789 --> 13:15.623
- What am I gonna do?
- You gotta quit.

13:15.624 --> 13:18.083
But I've never quit anything.

13:18.084 --> 13:20.064
I filled in for my
grandma's bowling team

13:20.065 --> 13:22.664
three years ago, and I still
go to the weekly games.

13:22.665 --> 13:28.565
You can't go up in front of all
those record execs like this.

13:29.471 --> 13:33.348
I know. I gotta tell Val I'm
leaving The Stray Kitties.

13:33.349 --> 13:35.247
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.069
Mm-mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm.

13:38.070 --> 13:41.165
No one leaves The Stray Kitties.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.952
You're gonna be wearing a
tail for the next five years.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.085
What?!

13:45.086 --> 13:49.987
Well, perhaps your manager should have read
the fine print before you signed this.

13:49.988 --> 13:53.054
What, nobody reads
the fine print.

13:53.055 --> 13:56.631
It's like reading the employee
handbook when you get a new job.

13:56.632 --> 13:58.552
Yeah!

14:02.630 --> 14:05.673
But I don't wanna
be a part of this.

14:05.674 --> 14:09.951
You're not really gonna make me do
something I don't wanna do. Are you?

14:09.952 --> 14:12.814
Mm. I can make you
do whatever I want.

14:12.815 --> 14:16.761
According to this
contract, I own you.

14:16.762 --> 14:18.742
Trish.

14:19.402 --> 14:21.922
What contract?

14:24.493 --> 14:27.457
Sweetie, I have six
more copies at home,

14:27.458 --> 14:32.576
a copy on my computer and I've
already faxed a copy to my lawyer.

14:32.577 --> 14:36.114
Yeah? Well, we're not
cleaning up that mess.

14:36.115 --> 14:38.035
Ally!

14:38.658 --> 14:41.321
Sorry. Habit. Oh!

14:41.322 --> 14:43.163
See you at the show!

14:43.164 --> 14:46.014
And every show for the
next five years...

14:46.015 --> 14:48.475
Wicked Kitty.

15:00.205 --> 15:02.373
Ally, I feel terrible.

15:02.374 --> 15:05.703
As your manager, I should have
read that contract more closely...

15:05.704 --> 15:08.044
Or at all.

15:08.447 --> 15:10.665
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

15:10.666 --> 15:13.639
Glamour Kitty agreed to go
on a date with me next week.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.286
Why would that make
me feel better?

15:15.287 --> 15:18.296
I don't know. Made
me feel pretty good.

15:18.297 --> 15:21.710
What am I supposed to do? I
can't break that contract.

15:21.711 --> 15:23.260
It's against the law.

15:23.261 --> 15:28.887
Do you know what they do to
Kitties like me in the pound?

15:28.888 --> 15:31.863
Ally, you're not giving
up on this opportunity.

15:31.864 --> 15:35.339
So you think I should perform
with The Stray Kitties?

15:35.340 --> 15:37.838
No. We're gonna get you
out of that contract,

15:37.839 --> 15:39.876
and you're gonna
sing solo tonight.

15:39.877 --> 15:42.606
We just need to figure out a way
to distract the other Kitties.

15:42.607 --> 15:45.674
I'm way ahead of you. My
cat loves this thing.

15:45.675 --> 15:48.749
Here, Glamour Kitty. Here, Glamour Kitty.
Get the little ball.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.149
- Give me that.
- Hey!

15:50.150 --> 15:52.749
You know they're not
actually cats, right?

15:52.750 --> 15:56.290
That's never going to work.

15:57.510 --> 15:59.550
Austin!

15:59.554 --> 16:01.534
Sorry.

16:09.075 --> 16:11.965
Okay, while Austin's taking
care of the Kitties,

16:11.966 --> 16:15.277
we need to come up with a plan
to get Ally out of her contract.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.723
You got anything?

16:16.724 --> 16:21.437
I had a cat toy on a stick, but
someone took it away from me.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.789
Forget the cat toy!

16:23.790 --> 16:27.176
Check it out. Those tulips
set me back a pretty penny.

16:27.177 --> 16:30.837
But Glamour Kitty's worth it.

16:35.219 --> 16:36.419
That's it.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.089
You just gave me an idea to
get Ally out of the group.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.797
Ah! I see where you're
going with this.

16:41.798 --> 16:43.359
You do?

16:43.360 --> 16:45.646
- Totally.
- Really?

16:45.647 --> 16:47.463
Yeah.

16:47.464 --> 16:51.367
But maybe you should
say it out loud first.

16:51.368 --> 16:54.008
Just follow me.

16:59.343 --> 17:00.708
Be honest.

17:00.709 --> 17:04.982
Do you think that my fake
eyelashes look too fake?

17:04.983 --> 17:08.042
No. Just fake enough.

17:09.788 --> 17:13.917
- We are gonna kill it tonight.
- If that Ally doesn't ruin it.

17:13.919 --> 17:18.261
I know, she does not have a
talented bone in her body.

17:18.262 --> 17:21.230
- Hey, Kitties.
- Hey, Austin Moon.

17:21.231 --> 17:25.135
We were just talking about how
talented your friend Ally's bones are.

17:25.136 --> 17:28.692
- Where is Ally?
- Oh. You didn't hear.

17:28.693 --> 17:31.005
Val wanted her to have
a special entrance.

17:31.006 --> 17:35.145
She's gonna crawl out of a trap door
center stage and start the show.

17:35.146 --> 17:37.936
Whoa, hold up. Why does Ally
get a special entrance?

17:37.937 --> 17:40.167
- Yeah.
- Val says she's the star of the group.

17:40.168 --> 17:42.787
She's not the star
of the group, I am!

17:42.788 --> 17:45.745
And if Ally's getting a
special entrance, so am I.

17:45.746 --> 17:47.650
Well, so am I.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.052
All right. If you say so.

17:50.053 --> 17:52.993
What are you doing?

17:54.641 --> 17:56.163
This...

17:56.164 --> 17:58.744
Stage tunnel...

17:59.503 --> 18:03.020
Leads directly
underneath the stage.

18:03.021 --> 18:05.853
- It does?
- Oh, yeah.

18:05.854 --> 18:09.245
I've played this club before.
Makes a great entrance.

18:09.246 --> 18:12.508
Take it all the way to the
end, and then pop up.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.257
- Me first!
- Out of my way!

18:14.258 --> 18:16.118
Ooh!

18:25.395 --> 18:29.265
Val, we got these for you to
apologize for our behavior.

18:29.266 --> 18:32.335
Ally's my best friend, so
I'm a little protective.

18:32.336 --> 18:34.470
But I know you're gonna
do great things for her.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.968
Well, I'm glad you finally
came to your senses.

18:37.969 --> 18:39.408
Thank you.

18:39.409 --> 18:43.789
Although, next time,
I'd prefer muffins.

18:45.082 --> 18:50.722
Wait, so instead of getting Ally out of
The Stray Kitties, we got Val flowers?

18:50.723 --> 18:52.839
And how come I have
to pay for those?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.708
It's all a part of my plan.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.769
Don't forget to tip.

18:59.955 --> 19:02.398
Thank you! Thank you!

19:02.399 --> 19:04.300
Thank you for coming!

19:04.301 --> 19:09.338
As I've proven over the years,
it takes talent to know talent.

19:09.339 --> 19:13.539
And no one is more
talented than me!

19:14.178 --> 19:19.578
Oh, and these girls. Please
welcome The Stray Kitties!

19:24.410 --> 19:28.730
There's been a slight
change of plans.

19:30.716 --> 19:34.882
The Stray Kitties aren't
performing tonight.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.863
I am.

19:38.035 --> 19:41.875
Hey, everybody. I'm Ally Dawson.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.412

19:55.044 --> 19:58.000
<i>♪ Someone will throw it...</i>

19:58.001 --> 20:01.224
What's going on? Where
are my Stray Kitties?

20:01.225 --> 20:03.426
I guess they strayed.

20:03.427 --> 20:06.845
She can't perform by herself.
That's not in the contract.

20:06.846 --> 20:10.333
It might not be in your
contract, but it's in ours.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.008
What is this ridiculousness?

20:12.009 --> 20:15.654
Looks like you should have read the fine
print when you signed for those flowers.

20:15.655 --> 20:20.373
As you can see, our new contract
makes yours null and void.

20:20.374 --> 20:23.194
Ha! What contract?

20:24.526 --> 20:26.742
Oh, Sweetie.

20:26.743 --> 20:28.339
I've already made
a dozen copies,

20:28.340 --> 20:30.982
scanned it in my computer
and faxed one to Dez's mom.

20:30.983 --> 20:32.288
Your mom's a lawyer?

20:32.289 --> 20:36.797
Nope, but she watched a lot
of that "Judge Jody" show.

20:36.798 --> 20:38.598
Oh!

21:21.372 --> 21:22.981
What up?!

21:22.982 --> 21:25.126
I can't believe how
awesome you were.

21:25.127 --> 21:27.852
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
Thank you so much.

21:27.853 --> 21:31.140
- You crushed it.
- A bunch of record execs wanna meet you.

21:31.141 --> 21:33.682
Look at all these
business cards.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.306
Well, some of these are feathers.
But still!

21:36.307 --> 21:38.543
That's amazing!

21:38.544 --> 21:42.499
Wait. So what happened
to the other Kitties?

21:42.500 --> 21:44.420
Meow!

21:55.406 --> 21:58.241
Sorry you didn't get a
chance to perform tonight.

21:58.242 --> 22:00.310
How about I...

22:00.311 --> 22:01.377
Make it up to you?

22:01.378 --> 22:03.379
After our dinner at
the Chateau Nouveau,

22:03.380 --> 22:06.416
I'll take you on a carriage
ride under the stars.

22:06.417 --> 22:08.529
Ugh, enough!

22:08.530 --> 22:12.221
The diamonds, the flowers, the
fancy dinners, it's all too much.

22:12.222 --> 22:16.326
But you're Glamour Kitty.
I thought this is...

22:16.327 --> 22:18.055
What you like.

22:18.056 --> 22:20.155
That's just my character.

22:20.156 --> 22:22.298
I'm not glamorous.

22:22.299 --> 22:27.629
I eat pizza, wear fun clothes
and watch "Zalien" movies.

22:27.630 --> 22:29.670
Zalien!

22:30.474 --> 22:32.684
I appreciate the gestures, Dez.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.249
But we're just not
right for each other.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.064
What?! No!

22:38.065 --> 22:41.289
I mean you're so sophisticated.

22:41.290 --> 22:45.414
Sorry Dez, it's just
not going to work.

22:45.415 --> 22:49.184
She's right. We're from
two different worlds.

22:49.185 --> 22:51.233
Wait, no we're not. Come back!
