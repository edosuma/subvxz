(eerie music)

01:20.381 --> 01:23.415
(eerie music continues)

02:39.360 --> 02:41.260
(door opening)

02:42.830 --> 02:44.997
(door closing)

02:52.806 --> 02:54.773
- I'm home.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.714
Hello?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.917
(utensils clattering)

03:15.529 --> 03:17.496
(radio playing, indistinct)

03:17.498 --> 03:19.198
Did you have a good day?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.532
- No.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.803
- You did grocery shopping?
- No.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.371
- So, there's no--

03:26.373 --> 03:27.873
- No!

03:27.875 --> 03:29.708
(TV): <i> Call in and let us know.</i>

03:29.710 --> 03:33.345
<i>Maybe you're a fascist pig
or a tree hugger.</i>

03:33.347 --> 03:35.647
<i>I don't care. I just want
to hear...</i>

03:35.649 --> 03:37.883
(TV): <i> ...reports are now flooding
in from all over the country,</i>

03:37.885 --> 03:40.319
<i>as well as from all over
the world.</i>

03:40.321 --> 03:43.855
<i>A lot of false information has
been spread on social media.</i>

03:43.857 --> 03:46.024
<i>So we urge you to check
the official channels</i>

03:46.026 --> 03:48.393
<i>for the latest
updated information.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:52.397
- Come on, it's just some big
pharmaceutical company trying to cash in.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.333
(TV, indistinct)

03:54.335 --> 03:57.669
They probably created the virus in
order to push their vaccine on us.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.105
Do you reckon?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.341
(TV reporter): <i>The rate
it's spreading is alarming</i>

04:02.343 --> 04:05.210
<i>and health officials are now
urging the public</i>

04:05.212 --> 04:08.313
<i>to stay at home
until further official news...</i>

04:09.717 --> 04:11.116
- Anyway.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.852
Look, I've got loads of papers
to mark.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.554
Then, I should go to bed.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.790
- Hey, I...
I want to...

04:24.198 --> 04:25.797
- You want to...?

04:27.701 --> 04:31.103
- Never mind, we'll talk about
it tomorrow when you get home.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.476
- Okey-dokey.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.451
(sirens wailing)
(background chatter)

05:11.745 --> 05:14.479
(TV playing, indistinct)

05:22.756 --> 05:26.491
(jet fighters flying overhead)

05:29.930 --> 05:33.165
(crashing, glass shattering)

05:37.438 --> 05:39.538
(alarm ringing)

05:43.377 --> 05:46.478
- What the fuck did you do?!
- Wait here!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.180
- Hey, I want to...

05:48.182 --> 05:49.848
I want to...

05:51.285 --> 05:52.784
(alarm ringing)

05:52.786 --> 05:54.853
...get a divorce.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.289
(siren wailing)

05:57.291 --> 06:00.459
(man): I guess it was just
a matter of time.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.361
- I'm sorry, what?

06:03.030 --> 06:06.365
- Hello? Ever heard about 9/11?

06:08.669 --> 06:13.472
(clattering)

06:13.474 --> 06:15.474
- Run! They're...

06:15.476 --> 06:18.210
- ...biting!
(panting)

06:20.981 --> 06:24.216
- What do you mean, biting?!

06:24.852 --> 06:29.221
(tires screeching outside,
crashing)

06:29.223 --> 06:31.990
(people yelling)

06:33.694 --> 06:36.228
(grunting)

06:39.733 --> 06:41.466
- Oh, my God!

06:43.504 --> 06:47.706
(TV): <i> The BBC is now reporting that
those infected are extremely dangerous</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:50.208
<i>and should be avoided
at all costs.</i>

06:50.210 --> 06:53.712
<i>Until further notice,
food rationing is advised.</i>

06:53.714 --> 06:56.248
<i>Meanwhile, Donald Trump
has just tweeted that--</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:59.751
- One, two, three, four...
cans of chopped tomatoes,

07:00.220 --> 07:04.289
two baked beans
and some Tabasco.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.826
(sirens wailing)
(indistinct shouting)

07:10.431 --> 07:11.696
- That's it?

07:11.698 --> 07:14.933
- Oh, and... and some ketchup.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.206
- I can't do this.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.745
(slamming door)

07:26.747 --> 07:29.614
Oh, God...

07:29.616 --> 07:32.584
(retching)

07:32.586 --> 07:35.420
- Are you okay?

07:35.422 --> 07:38.457
(retching)

07:38.459 --> 07:41.293
- That list is not gonna last us
more than a couple of days,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.028
tops!

07:43.564 --> 07:45.664
- I have an idea.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.766
- I really don't want
to do this.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.569
- You said so yourself. Our supplies
won't last us more than a couple of days.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.404
And if the door to the building
is locked,

07:52.406 --> 07:56.541
then you should probably
be okay out in the hallway.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.911
- "Probably?"

08:01.114 --> 08:04.950
You do realize that looting
our neighbours' homes...

08:04.952 --> 08:06.585
is kind of illegal?

08:06.587 --> 08:10.222
- Honestly, I really don't think
they'll give a shit anymore.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.059
You saw what happened out there.
Jesus!

08:14.995 --> 08:17.262
Their faces were all gone!

08:18.198 --> 08:21.766
Look, we'll take it in turns.
Okay?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.108
(scoffing)

08:32.446 --> 08:34.111
(TV, indistinct)

08:34.114 --> 08:36.847
And you didn't hear anyone?
- No.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.551
The door to the Andersons'
was open.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.957
(TV): <i>Put Xs in your windows,
and wait for help...</i>

08:49.630 --> 08:52.130
- Oh...

08:52.132 --> 08:53.798
Okay.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.202
You should check
their place out too.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.774
- Oddjob.
(chuckling)

09:03.577 --> 09:05.310
- Okay.

09:05.312 --> 09:09.915
There are some...
moving boxes in the wardrobe.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.183
You should get those out
so that...

09:12.185 --> 09:14.686
we can store our stuff
in them.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.154
See you later.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.727
You should see her clothes.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.063
- Were you planning
on leaving me?

09:29.503 --> 09:32.137
I was just wondering,
just because of the...

09:32.940 --> 09:34.573
Well, the moving boxes were...

09:34.575 --> 09:39.578
Or perhaps you got them for
that stuff we put in storage?

09:42.516 --> 09:43.949
- Yeah.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.053
- Okay.
- Your turn.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.355
- I really don't wanna do this.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.559
(sighing)

09:54.561 --> 09:58.029
- I couldn't help noticing
the Andersons have a...

09:58.031 --> 09:59.764
They have a bigger TV than us.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.700
Forty-inch, I think.
- Oh, really?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.302
- Yeah.
- Oh, good...

10:06.573 --> 10:08.540
(TV): <i>...North European
refugees.</i>

10:08.542 --> 10:10.709
<i>This is our last broadcast
for now.</i>

10:10.711 --> 10:13.378
<i>We'll be back as soon as
the situation has stabilized.</i>

10:13.380 --> 10:16.281
<i>Until then, you are all urged
to stay indoors,</i>

10:16.283 --> 10:18.249
<i>and avoid physical contact
with others.</i>

10:18.251 --> 10:20.552
<i>Rescue teams are out
evacuating people.</i>

10:20.554 --> 10:24.155
<i>Put an X in your windows so these
rescue workers can find you.</i>

10:24.157 --> 10:27.225
<i>Tune in to radio FM 1.03.2</i>

10:27.227 --> 10:29.661
<i>at 3 PM for
the latest updates.</i>

10:29.663 --> 10:35.000
<i>We repeat, put an X in your windows

10:35.736 --> 10:37.569
(long beep)

10:37.571 --> 10:39.304
(classical music)

10:51.952 --> 10:54.519
(helicopters flying overhead)

11:14.608 --> 11:17.075
(thunder rumbling)

11:27.120 --> 11:29.954
- Good morning.
- What the fuck?!

11:29.956 --> 11:32.357
- I couldn't sleep,
so I went out to get some stuff.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.459
- You went to get some stuff?!
- And we don't know

11:34.461 --> 11:36.961
how long we're gonna be cooped
up here, do we, so...

11:36.963 --> 11:39.030
Might as well stock up,
just in case.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.133
I mean, hopefully we'll be
rescued soon.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.436
But better safe than sorry,
right?

11:47.307 --> 11:51.576
- At which point we'll return
the things we've taken, right?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.114
- Of course.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.317
- Oh...

11:59.319 --> 12:01.219
You're kidding?

12:02.756 --> 12:05.824
- I know! It's crazy.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.059
But she looks fatter, right?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.096
- We could go to St Paul's.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.431
I bet people are seeking refuge
there.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.167
- You're joking, right?
You heard what they said.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.571
Stay indoors, wait for help.
Seems pretty clear to me.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.607
- Yeah, but what if they...

12:22.609 --> 12:25.844
the... the infected people...

12:25.846 --> 12:27.579
what if they try to get in?

12:29.683 --> 12:33.918
(sighing)
- We'll defend ourselves.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.258
(eerie music)

12:59.079 --> 13:02.313
(radio): <i>We still don't know
the cause behind the epidemic,</i>

13:02.315 --> 13:04.482
<i>why only certain parts of
the world are affected,</i>

13:04.484 --> 13:07.385
<i>or why those who are infected
act the way they do.</i>

13:07.387 --> 13:11.055
<i>All we can do is urge everyone
to please stay indoors.</i>

13:11.057 --> 13:12.824
<i>We know there are a lot of
you out there,</i>

13:12.826 --> 13:15.226
<i>and we're doing everything in
our power to keep water</i>

13:15.228 --> 13:17.595
<i>and electricity going
as best we can.</i>

13:17.597 --> 13:19.898
<i>In return,
all I'm asking of you</i>

13:19.900 --> 13:22.567
<i>is that you keep yourselves
busy while you wait for help,</i>

13:22.569 --> 13:25.570
<i>because help is on the way.
Thank you.</i>

13:25.572 --> 13:28.973
<i>- That was the Department of
Health's chief scientific--</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:31.042
- "Keep busy."

13:31.278 --> 13:34.245
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.982
- Kill time while we wait
for help?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.985
- How? Doing what?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.493
- It's going to be okay.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.363
Soon all of this will be over
and...

13:52.365 --> 13:55.433
everything will return
back to normal.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.504
- Normal...

14:01.308 --> 14:04.776
Some of our neighbours
are lying...

14:04.778 --> 14:09.113
half-eaten,
by my bike out there.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.449
And there's a bunch
of infected fuckers

14:11.451 --> 14:14.319
running around trying to bite
our faces off.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.121
What "normal"
are you talking about?!

14:18.124 --> 14:19.891
- if we look at history,

14:19.893 --> 14:25.129
what it teaches us is that at every,
shall we say, momentous event,

14:25.131 --> 14:30.201
people have shown a remarkable
ability to recover and...

14:30.837 --> 14:33.638
if we take the...
the Black Death

14:33.640 --> 14:36.307
and even world wars and...

14:36.309 --> 14:38.810
- Is this what you teach your students?
(scoffing)

14:38.812 --> 14:42.981
That everything will
probably be okay?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.486
- Where are you going?
- Wine.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.422
- Oh, hang on, hang on.
Please, just...

14:51.424 --> 14:54.592
Really? This early?

14:57.330 --> 15:01.332
- I've been drinking wine every
single day for a year almost.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.901
Ever since she...

15:03.536 --> 15:07.338
What do you think
my "magazine expense" is?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.507
Haven't you noticed
I've been reading

15:09.509 --> 15:12.844
the same goddamn magazines
over and over again?!

15:18.785 --> 15:21.686
That was when we died,
wasn't it?

15:21.688 --> 15:25.590
The thing I wanted more than
anything else in this life,

15:25.592 --> 15:28.159
I can't have anymore.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.496
I didn't see myself in her.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.034
But I did see you.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.708
So looking at you every day...

15:43.710 --> 15:46.277
it hurts.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.380
(sniffling)
People throw pity parties for us

15:49.382 --> 15:52.050
to make themselves feel better
about their own relationships.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.719
"Hey, as long as we haven't
got it as bad as them."

15:54.721 --> 15:56.120
- I know.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.823
We're the sad couple.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.128
(chuckling): I don't give a shit
what they think.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.399
(crying): I just...

16:09.836 --> 16:12.303
I just wanted to see
her grow.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.175
My baby girl.
- Me too.

16:18.345 --> 16:23.414
- And pretty soon,
we'll be gone too.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.651
- No.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.488
No.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.325
We're gonna get through this.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.263
- Do you actually believe that?
- I know it. I actually know it.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.798
And if...

16:40.800 --> 16:45.403
one of them tries to break in,
we'll be fucking ready.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.573
Yeah.

16:49.776 --> 16:53.011
Come on, practice makes perfect.
Come on!

16:59.052 --> 17:03.921
(eerie music)

17:27.213 --> 17:29.213
- Shh!

17:30.083 --> 17:32.150
(whispering): Someone's
at the door.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.485
(whispering): You reckon
it's the rescue team?

17:38.425 --> 17:39.690
(both shouting)

17:39.692 --> 17:41.926
(growling)

17:41.928 --> 17:43.628
Fuck off! Fuck!

17:45.331 --> 17:46.731
Fuck's sake!

17:46.733 --> 17:49.967
(panting)

17:51.604 --> 17:52.737
(growling in the corridor)

17:52.739 --> 17:55.406
- Tea.
- Coffee.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.509
(radio): <i>Professor Olpes says
it should be relatively easy</i>

17:58.511 --> 18:01.112
<i>to isolate the virus
and find a vaccine.</i>

18:01.114 --> 18:04.248
<i>We'll be back with more news
at 12 o'clock.</i>

18:06.686 --> 18:09.520
- I can really kill
for a smoke right now.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.422
Seriously.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.606
(exhaling)

18:30.310 --> 18:31.809
Thank you.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.945
What else have you got
under there?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.119
- Go in there
and sit on the couch.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.654
- Why?

18:43.656 --> 18:47.525
Get the fuck out of here!
This is not even funny.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.360
(sniffing)

18:51.798 --> 18:53.397
(laughing)

18:53.399 --> 18:55.066
- It had its perks, working
in the evidence locker, um?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.068
- Seriously.
What the fuck are you doing?!

18:57.070 --> 18:59.904
- Cocaine.
What?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.272
- What do you mean, "what?"

19:01.274 --> 19:03.841
- What do you mean,
"what do you mean, what?"

19:03.843 --> 19:06.144
- How much it is worth, then?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.579
- Thirty, thirty-five grand.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.615
- Are you... are you fucking
shitting me right now?

19:10.617 --> 19:14.819
(laughing): No. Not right now.
Usually, yes, but not right now.

19:15.255 --> 19:19.090
Don't be such a fucking wuss.
- Oh, so now you're just full-on bully?

19:19.092 --> 19:21.192
- Oh, little sissy!

19:21.194 --> 19:22.460
- You know what this is, right?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.695
- I know perfectly well
what it is.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.631
Little bitch.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.667
- This is highly addictive.
- Yeah, whatever.

19:32.505 --> 19:36.507
- Fine. And not because
I need it, actually,

19:36.509 --> 19:41.179
but because I want to,
and maybe also I need it.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.020
(snorting)

19:50.456 --> 19:52.023
(sniffing)

19:52.025 --> 19:54.358
- I never thought I'd say this,
but...

19:55.628 --> 19:57.728
I'm proud of you.

19:58.331 --> 20:02.033
- For doing drugs?
- For having the guts to try it.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.869
- Thirty-five grand?

20:04.871 --> 20:08.039
- Thirty, thirty-five.
Thereabouts.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.542
- How do you--
- That's just for the coke.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.979
- What the fuck else have you
got under that sink?!

20:14.981 --> 20:19.817
- Cocaine. Cannabis. LSD.
Valium. Amphetamines.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.886
Roofies. Sobril. Heroin.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.020
Ecstasy!

20:23.022 --> 20:25.990
- Oh! Hello.
- And...

20:27.193 --> 20:31.229
Glock 17.
- Because, why?

20:36.736 --> 20:40.404
Oh, no! So what were you planning
on doing with all this stuff?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.906
- I don't know...

20:41.908 --> 20:44.675
And it was just collecting dust
in the evidence locker room.

20:44.677 --> 20:48.980
No one even noticed when
I switched a few things out.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.350
- But they did, though,
didn't they?

20:52.352 --> 20:54.719
- They couldn't really prove
anything.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.954
- Or afford a huge public
scandal?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.193
So, I mean... was it...

21:02.195 --> 21:04.262
was any of this worth it?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.600
- Sometimes.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.970
-Yeah? In what way?

21:15.708 --> 21:18.042
- Ever notice something...

21:18.044 --> 21:20.611
the few times we have sex
nowadays?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.481
- Um...

21:23.483 --> 21:24.548
No, I... no.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.719
- There's this...
thing we always eat.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.454
- Eat?
- Yeah.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.428
- The muffins?!
- Ecstasy muffins!

21:37.430 --> 21:40.064
(laughing)

21:40.066 --> 21:42.967
- Oh, that's smart.
- Thanks.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.442
- I'm not getting much
of a buzz. Do you, um...

21:51.444 --> 21:53.878
I don't know, should we do
another small one?

21:55.748 --> 21:58.416
(TV): <i>This is a public service
announcement...</i>

21:58.418 --> 22:01.819
(man moaning)
- Do you wanna watch a movie?

22:02.422 --> 22:05.089
I mean, there's fuck all on TV.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.592
- Sure.
- Could get an old VHS out?

22:08.594 --> 22:10.995
- They told us to keep busy,
right?

22:12.198 --> 22:13.998
(TV): <i>Use your
water only for...</i>

22:16.602 --> 22:18.969
(gunshot)

22:18.971 --> 22:22.039
(panting)

22:24.177 --> 22:27.712
- What the... shit?!

22:27.714 --> 22:29.080
- Sorry.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.949
- My mother gave me that.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.218
- But you...
you hate your mother.

22:34.220 --> 22:38.189
- So? That's not the point.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.460
- Sorry.
- I heard you the first time.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.295
- Sor...

22:44.297 --> 22:46.831
- I'm gonna take a bath.
- I'm gonna make breakfast.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.300
(water running)

22:56.309 --> 22:59.810
(helicopter flying overhead)

22:59.812 --> 23:01.712
(spitting)

23:11.090 --> 23:12.990
So, yesterday was...

23:14.761 --> 23:16.394
Eye-opening.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.032
Maybe we need to face the fact

23:22.034 --> 23:25.069
that we're gonna be here
for a while.

23:26.339 --> 23:30.474
So I think we should prepare
ourselves for the long haul.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.578
I've got a few things in mind.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.282
Three... two... one!

23:43.923 --> 23:47.291
Okay, okay, okay.
Go! Go! Go!

23:50.530 --> 23:53.197
(panting)

23:55.234 --> 23:57.601
- At least Mom's china
wasn't a total waste.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.539
Oh, hey! Not the Stoli.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.941
(soft music)

24:25.898 --> 24:29.033
(chains rattling)

24:30.002 --> 24:32.303
Shit, isn't it time?

24:32.905 --> 24:37.508
(sniffing)
- Oh, goddammit!

24:37.510 --> 24:39.076
- Goddammit is right.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.979
- That's good shit.
- Awesome shit.

24:43.249 --> 24:47.284
It's three o'clock, right?
- Um, yeah.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.919
- Weren't they supposed
to air now?

24:48.921 --> 24:51.422
- Yeah.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.991
- What the hell?!

24:54.327 --> 24:57.995
(knocking on door)
- What the hell?!

25:02.001 --> 25:04.335
- Yeah, what the hell?!

25:13.946 --> 25:16.714
(knocking on door)

25:16.716 --> 25:18.949
(man): Is there anybody?

25:33.533 --> 25:36.901
- Oh, hi.
- Hello. Hi.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.570
- Hi. How are you?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.139
- Oh, fine.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.308
How... how do you do?

25:44.310 --> 25:47.244
- Well, yeah. Doing rather well.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.415
- Would you mind if we come in?

25:54.720 --> 25:58.989
If we don't bother, we'd really
appreciate it if we could.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.226
- Yeah. If it's...
if it's convenient.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.331
- Sure.
- Sure.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.267
- Sure thing.
Shush.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.740
- Hi.
(chuckling)

26:16.742 --> 26:18.342
Come in, come in.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.178
- So we got stuck in the
laundry room after the crash,

26:21.180 --> 26:24.181
and once we got out,
we realized

26:24.183 --> 26:27.418
there were infected people
in our apartment.

26:28.521 --> 26:32.890
And then, we passed by and saw this
broken glass outside your door.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.025
And I instantly got what it was.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.161
Yeah, smart.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.930
- Thank you.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.932
- And have you heard
anything at all?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.101
Our phones died last night,
so...

26:44.103 --> 26:46.604
- Um, no, we haven't.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.441
Not even on the radio.
It's, um... it's just...

26:51.444 --> 26:52.977
Dead.

26:52.979 --> 26:56.313
- Lots of people fleeing,
it seems.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.515
- Yeah.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.685
(stomach grumbling)

27:04.090 --> 27:07.324
You wouldn't happen to have
anything to eat?

27:07.326 --> 27:11.295
Maybe just a little... snack?

27:12.064 --> 27:15.099
We kind of haven't eaten
in two days now.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.568
- Yeah. It's true.
- Yeah.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.342
- Of course.
- So kind of you.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.977
- What the fuck
are we gonna do now?!

27:26.979 --> 27:28.078
- I don't know.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.614
Uh, wait...

27:30.616 --> 27:32.416
What do you mean?

27:32.418 --> 27:35.252
- Are we supposed to feed
these two now as well?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.421
- I mean, you know what happened
to them, right?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.324
- Uh, no. What?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.359
- You know, she was pregnant,
and then,

27:42.361 --> 27:44.695
apparently, she had
a stillborn child.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.330
- Oh.
- And I think now,

27:46.332 --> 27:48.098
she can't get pregnant.

27:49.335 --> 27:53.003
And apparently, after that,
she just went a bit, uh...

27:53.005 --> 27:54.705
(whistling)

27:54.707 --> 27:59.009
Yeah, bananas, totally.
- Oh... how awful.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.545
- I mean... still,
it's no excuse

28:01.547 --> 28:04.281
for taking down my reminders
in the laundry room.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.883
- We can't just throw them out

28:05.885 --> 28:09.019
just because she wrote some
angry notes in the laundry room.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.121
- But how long, though?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.524
This cuts our food supplies
in half.

28:13.526 --> 28:16.894
- Okay, let's just take this
one step at a time.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.798
- She was doing her laundry
right after me

28:20.800 --> 28:22.900
and I just put a reminder up.

28:22.902 --> 28:27.438
And when I went back to get my
detergent, the note was gone.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.474
I mean, some people, just...

28:30.476 --> 28:32.643
- Maybe they've come out
here to regroup,

28:32.645 --> 28:35.245
get their strength back up.
And then, they'll...

28:35.247 --> 28:37.715
head back out and look for help?

28:38.818 --> 28:40.551
- Sure.

28:45.324 --> 28:49.426
Maybe we can help them
to arrive at that decision.

28:51.697 --> 28:55.499
- What's your plan?
Turn all Nazi on them?

28:55.501 --> 28:58.669
- No! Just...

28:58.671 --> 29:01.205
give them a little nudge...

29:01.207 --> 29:03.407
before they eat all our food.
- Take all our jobs,

29:03.409 --> 29:05.876
change our culture, fuck our women?
That kind of thing?

29:05.878 --> 29:07.144
(scoffing)
Excuse me.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.786
(woman chuckling)
What?

29:15.788 --> 29:18.222
- Cocaine.

29:18.224 --> 29:21.358
It totally stifles hunger!

29:21.360 --> 29:25.429
- Thank you so much.
I feel so much better now.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.865
- Yeah, me too.
Thank you!

29:27.867 --> 29:30.300
It's really... super.
Thank you.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.438
Oh, I love your dress.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.674
I have the exact same one.
I love it.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.782
- And we've got
that same telly!

29:44.784 --> 29:47.718
- Oh.
- Yes.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.286
- I...

29:49.288 --> 29:52.523
I think there's quite a few
things we've got in common.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.300
- Sorry to be blunt, um...

30:04.436 --> 30:08.372
What are your plans... now?

30:10.242 --> 30:13.577
I mean, you're obviously welcome
to stay here,

30:13.579 --> 30:16.313
but it's just...

30:17.016 --> 30:19.249
our food supplies are limited.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.286
And we really don't know when

30:22.288 --> 30:26.323
or if the rescue teams
are coming.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.659
- Oh, yes, of course, we get it.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.361
Uh, sorry. We'd probably feel
the same way

30:31.363 --> 30:33.030
if the shoe was
on the other foot.

30:33.032 --> 30:37.301
No, no, no, no.
You want us to leave, say the word.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

30:43.809 --> 30:47.277
- No, of course not.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.114
You can... you can stay here.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.183
- How kind of you, thank you.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.355
- Obviously, we appreciate what
you're doing to help us, so...

30:58.357 --> 31:03.293
If there's anything we can do
to contribute, just let us know.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.630
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You're our guests.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.199
- That's very nice.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.044
- Would you like a drink?

31:21.046 --> 31:23.547
- Well, yes, I never say no
to a drink.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.182
(laughing)

31:25.184 --> 31:27.551
- Of course you wouldn't. Yeah.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.559
Thank you.
- No, don't mention it.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.566
- No, but...

31:42.568 --> 31:46.904
Really, if there's anything
that we can do to help,

31:46.906 --> 31:49.206
just... just say the word.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.509
Anything at all.
- Thank you.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.478
Sure.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.316
What are you good at?

32:00.686 --> 32:02.619
- What's that?

32:04.089 --> 32:07.491
- What are you... good at?

32:12.064 --> 32:15.732
- Oh, uh... Emily is the best
at cleaning.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.200
Yeah, yeah.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.702
Yeah, aren't you?

32:18.704 --> 32:21.605
It's like walking around a china
shop where we live, yeah!

32:21.607 --> 32:25.375
(laughing)
Can't even move, is it?

32:26.378 --> 32:29.980
- Yeah, well, Leo is good at
um...

32:34.219 --> 32:39.289
(rueful laugh)
I was gonna say "nothing."

32:39.291 --> 32:43.760
Uh, organizing, right?
Is that a thing? Organizing.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.629
- What do you mean, organizing?

32:45.631 --> 32:48.632
- Hello! Your toolbox?
(smacks lips)

32:49.969 --> 32:51.902
- So how about, uh...

32:51.904 --> 32:56.006
you spruce the place up
a little bit later. And...

32:56.008 --> 33:00.410
How about you put
some order in here?

33:02.414 --> 33:04.348
- Yes, sure.
- Yeah.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.283
- Great.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.418
(sighing with satisfaction)

33:08.420 --> 33:09.987
- Oh!
- You like red?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.855
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah...

33:11.857 --> 33:14.257
(classical music)

33:14.593 --> 33:17.794
It's not all
about processing power, John.

33:17.796 --> 33:21.932
Mac's OS is just superior,
everyone knows that.

33:21.934 --> 33:25.102
- That's bullshit.
No, no, no, no...

33:25.104 --> 33:28.605
All that Mac crap are just...
they're just Windows rip-offs.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.641
Even my students know that.
- No!

33:31.643 --> 33:34.878
Now, you really need
to understand that--

33:34.880 --> 33:36.580
- What?

33:38.283 --> 33:40.984
Sorry, what do I need
to understand?

33:40.986 --> 33:43.887
- That you're probably right.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.490
- Yeah... About?

33:46.492 --> 33:49.292
- About PC being better
than Mac.

33:49.294 --> 33:53.597
- Yeah! Exactly. Hey.
I knew you'd come around.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.468
- So, we should probably try
and get some sleep, huh?

33:58.470 --> 34:00.804
- Yeah, yeah.

34:00.806 --> 34:03.840
Is there anywhere we could

34:03.842 --> 34:06.043
have a little sleep, maybe?

34:08.914 --> 34:10.514
- Um...

34:10.516 --> 34:14.418
You could sleep on the floor
down there.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.788
- You want us to sleep
on the floor!?

34:19.324 --> 34:23.592
- Uh, yeah, I mean, you can have
the sofa cushions

34:23.594 --> 34:25.661
and I can get you
some more pillows.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.098
- I just assumed the couch
pulled out.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.268
- You know what, it does,
it does pull out,

34:31.270 --> 34:36.106
but it's really hard to pull
back in, so... yeah.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.476
- Uh... okay, okay.

34:41.547 --> 34:46.016
Oh! Do you think you could loan
us a spare toothbrush?

34:46.752 --> 34:50.020
- Loan? What, are you
gonna return it?

34:50.022 --> 34:54.357
- No, no, sorry, I mean,
we would buy you a new one, of course.

34:54.359 --> 34:58.395
(laughing)
- Just... I'm kidding!

34:58.397 --> 35:00.764
Of course you can loan
a toothbrush.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.466
- Oh, oh...

35:02.468 --> 35:03.767
(laughing)

35:03.769 --> 35:06.436
- Not everyone gets her sense
of humour.

35:06.438 --> 35:10.173
- They think they're so much better than
us just because they've got four bedrooms.

35:11.043 --> 35:13.276
It's 120 square feet more.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.078
- Then, why don't we just tell
them to go?

35:15.080 --> 35:17.881
- For fuck's sake, think!

35:17.883 --> 35:19.749
How will that make us look?

35:19.751 --> 35:22.319
The whole neighbourhood would find
out that we hadn't helped them.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.688
- Yeah, I didn't think of that.

35:26.825 --> 35:30.794
I know what we could do.
Something really annoying.

35:35.067 --> 35:38.235
(moaning in pleasure)

35:40.105 --> 35:44.474
(moaning)

36:02.961 --> 36:05.529
(moaning from the living room)

36:06.765 --> 36:08.598
- What the fuck?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.168
(moaning)

36:11.170 --> 36:13.370
- What are you doing?
- Ah!

36:15.641 --> 36:17.707
- Slap it.
- What?

36:17.709 --> 36:20.043
- Slap my fucking ass.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.711
(gently tapping)

36:21.713 --> 36:24.948
Slap it harder! So they can
hear it! Put your back into it!

36:24.950 --> 36:26.683
(slapping)
Ah!

36:28.620 --> 36:30.520
- Ah!

36:34.726 --> 36:36.626
- Another one?

36:39.064 --> 36:41.364
(birdsong)

36:47.139 --> 36:49.105
(lock clicking)

36:52.978 --> 36:55.078
- Just a minute.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.090
(toilet flushing)

37:09.494 --> 37:12.395
- Should I come back later?

37:16.902 --> 37:18.235
- All done.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.239
After you.
- Thank you.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.518
I was thinking, after breakfast,

37:35.520 --> 37:38.755
you could get started
on that thing we talked about?

37:40.892 --> 37:42.626
- I'm sorry, um...

37:42.628 --> 37:44.261
What thing?

37:44.263 --> 37:48.064
- You know, you could clear
the table, do the dishes.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.599
General cleaning up.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.169
And you, Leo, you could
do some organizing. Right?

37:54.573 --> 37:58.275
- Yeah. And what do you want me
to organize?

37:59.711 --> 38:02.545
- Our socks,
they're all jumbled up.

38:02.547 --> 38:05.148
If you could pair them up,
that would be great.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.451
- Sure.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.455
- Sound good?

38:14.092 --> 38:16.926
- Sounds good.
- Great.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.528
It's a deal.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.564
- Deal.

38:23.802 --> 38:29.105
- Honey, um, I fell asleep
during that karate video.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.309
Can we continue watching it?

38:33.145 --> 38:35.211
- Yeah, sure.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.584
I'm sorry.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.558
(TV playing indistinctly)

38:51.930 --> 38:55.098
(grunting on TV)

38:59.037 --> 39:01.271
- God! Can you believe
this shit?

39:01.273 --> 39:04.274
- Yeah, it's pretty weird.

39:04.276 --> 39:08.511
- Pretty weird?! We don't have
to put up with this shit.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.981
- Maybe write an angry note
about it.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.583
- What?

39:14.786 --> 39:18.254
- I said, what are we gonna do
about it?

39:19.124 --> 39:21.257
- Pretty soon,
we're gonna have to act.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.627
- Act?

39:24.629 --> 39:29.132
- You realize that this is gonna
come down

39:29.134 --> 39:32.535
to them or us?

39:36.508 --> 39:40.810
(eerie music)

39:44.816 --> 39:47.717
- You think I'd look good with a
stache like Lee Van Cleef?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.121
- Who?

39:51.890 --> 39:54.491
- That guy.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.599
- I've finished the dishes.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.802
- Oh, great.

40:07.272 --> 40:10.073
Uh... you can help your husband

40:10.075 --> 40:12.509
do the socks now,
if you want to.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.779
- Sure.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.150
- Only if you really want
to, though.

40:21.186 --> 40:25.355
- Yeah, no, I'd... I'd love to.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.192
(grunting on TV)

40:31.863 --> 40:34.864
- Fuck me, you're evil.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.100
- They won't last the day.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.936
I know hate is a strong word,

40:39.938 --> 40:43.606
but I hate their fucking guts!

40:45.710 --> 40:47.777
- Just play along.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.180
Their home, their rules.

40:51.383 --> 40:52.849
- What?!

40:54.386 --> 40:56.286
They're sitting there
watching a movie

40:56.288 --> 41:00.723
and we're out here
sorting their socks.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.392
- Yeah.

41:02.394 --> 41:04.761
- And what, you don't think
that's degrading?

41:04.763 --> 41:07.897
- No. I mean, I do, but...

41:07.899 --> 41:09.732
- We need to do something.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.602
- We could just get the fuck out of here.
No one's making us stay.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.304
- What, are you on their side
now?

41:14.306 --> 41:18.074
- No, no, no, no but--
- The gloves are coming off.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.909
It's us or them.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.644
- And what do you have in mind?

41:24.783 --> 41:27.617
- Mutiny. We rise up.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.385
We take power.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.924
- And how do you propose
we do that?

41:34.926 --> 41:38.294
- I don't know.
(sighing)

41:38.296 --> 41:40.663
Not yet. Not yet...

41:42.334 --> 41:44.300
We play along with their game
for now,

41:44.302 --> 41:47.203
and find their weaknesses.
And...

41:47.205 --> 41:49.539
- Overpower them in their sleep.

41:52.444 --> 41:53.576
- Yeah.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.113
We'll do it tonight!
- Yeah.

41:57.115 --> 42:00.450
- And I'd really like her to
put up a good fight, because...

42:03.355 --> 42:06.289
- Oh, I love it
when you get all evil.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.695
We're all done with the socks.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.108
(whispering):
Should we do it now?

42:26.811 --> 42:28.311
- Do what?!

42:30.882 --> 42:32.549
- Um...

42:34.152 --> 42:37.320
I thought I'd bake you
some cookies.

42:37.322 --> 42:41.491
To say thank you
for having us stay.

42:42.227 --> 42:45.194
- She's awesome
at baking cookies.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.596
- Yeah.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.168
- Great.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.003
- Yeah.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.339
- But let me make them, though.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.609
After all, you're our guests.

42:59.611 --> 43:03.012
- Oh, that's nice.
- That is nice.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.248
- You're really super nice.
- Mm.

43:07.018 --> 43:10.753
Sit down, watch a movie.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.022
Kick back.

43:13.024 --> 43:16.326
Escape reality for a...
little bit.

43:16.728 --> 43:21.030
- Yeah, that's a very good idea.
Thank you. What have you got?

43:21.032 --> 43:23.766
- I'll pick a good one for you.

43:26.605 --> 43:27.937
Enjoy!

43:27.939 --> 43:29.872
- And what did you pick?

43:29.874 --> 43:32.875
- Out of Africa.

43:32.877 --> 43:36.079
- Oh...

43:36.081 --> 43:38.047
Thank you, that's a...

43:38.049 --> 43:40.049
a classic.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.684
- Excuse me.

43:49.661 --> 43:51.127
- Do this.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.296
Be prepared.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.565
This film is a tactical move.

43:55.567 --> 43:57.667
- A tactical move?!
- Yeah.

43:58.770 --> 44:00.436
Out of Africa?

44:00.438 --> 44:04.407
It's probably the most
boring film of all time.

44:04.409 --> 44:07.744
She is trying to put us
to sleep.

44:07.746 --> 44:10.513
- I think we've underestimated
our dear opponents.

44:11.516 --> 44:13.750
- You think?

44:13.752 --> 44:17.153
- When they thought I was
asleep, I heard them say,

44:17.155 --> 44:19.522
"Should we do it now?"

44:20.825 --> 44:23.092
- Okay?

44:23.094 --> 44:24.694
- Meaning:
"Should we kill them now?"

44:24.696 --> 44:27.830
- What? No, no, no, no.
That's a little bit extreme.

44:27.832 --> 44:30.700
- I'm telling you, Curler Bitch
and Country Club Asshole

44:30.702 --> 44:33.569
know they wouldn't stand
a chance out there.

44:34.272 --> 44:39.175
- But if...<i> if</i> they're out
to kill us,

44:40.278 --> 44:43.446
what do you want to do about it?

44:44.315 --> 44:46.082
- I've got a plan.

44:46.818 --> 44:49.285
(TV): <i>You can't tame me.
I'm a lioness.</i>

44:49.287 --> 44:51.154
- Oat cookies.
- Mm...

44:51.156 --> 44:52.722
- Fresh from the oven.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.959
Help yourselves.

44:56.961 --> 44:59.162
- Uh... what's in them?

44:59.164 --> 45:01.831
- Oh, um... the usual.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.801
Plus a secret ingredient.

45:06.471 --> 45:08.137
I'll put some coffee on, too.

45:08.139 --> 45:10.306
Honey, could you help me
with the cups?

45:10.308 --> 45:13.242
- Course.
- Plenty more where they came from.

45:13.244 --> 45:15.078
- These are really good.

45:15.313 --> 45:18.147
(sniffing)
- Mm.

45:18.149 --> 45:21.884
- Well?
What's the secret ingredient?

45:21.886 --> 45:24.120
- Amphetamines!

45:25.023 --> 45:26.989
- Are you... Are you serious?!

45:26.991 --> 45:30.426
I thought you were gonna say...
Valium or something.

45:32.363 --> 45:35.264
How much?
- All of it.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.136
- All of it?!

45:41.506 --> 45:43.005
- Here are the coffees.

45:43.675 --> 45:46.676
(nervously): Oh, coffee, coffee!
Oh, yes! Coffee, coffee, coffee!

45:46.678 --> 45:49.011
Oh, I like coffee. I can't live
without coffee, actually.

45:49.013 --> 45:52.014
It's like, living... you can't
live without breathing!

45:52.016 --> 45:53.916
You know what's strange,
or crazy?

45:53.918 --> 45:56.519
That fish, they can breathe in the water.
(chuckling)

45:56.521 --> 46:00.356
Yeah, what's also very, very weird
that water can be a solid or a gas.

46:00.358 --> 46:01.958
So strange!
(chuckling)

46:01.960 --> 46:04.694
Did you see that YouTube clip?
- Oh, with the sneaky cat?

46:04.696 --> 46:07.029
- The sneaky cat.
Yes, of course, the sneaky cat!

46:07.031 --> 46:08.531
(meowing)
(growling)

46:08.533 --> 46:11.033
It was a bit horrible,
but funny at the same time.

46:11.035 --> 46:13.369
Oh, so strange.
(wheezing)

46:13.371 --> 46:15.538
What... what's the matter?
(coughing)

46:15.540 --> 46:16.873
Keep on breathing.
Calm down.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.074
(grunting)
Your throat?

46:18.076 --> 46:20.710
(mumbling)
Do you have... something?

46:20.712 --> 46:22.445
(gasping for air)

46:24.048 --> 46:26.516
(mumbling)

46:30.555 --> 46:32.054
You're... argh...

46:32.056 --> 46:34.891
You're so... so super nice.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.559
Thank you.

46:36.561 --> 46:39.695
(shaking)

46:44.002 --> 46:45.434
- Maybe I overdid it.

46:45.436 --> 46:48.638
- How much was... "all of it"?

46:51.976 --> 46:53.843
- Two tablespoons.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.214
- Probably overdid it then.

47:00.985 --> 47:03.386
- They're just passed out,
right?

47:06.424 --> 47:07.890
(gasping)

47:14.265 --> 47:17.533
- No, I think we, um...
we murdered them.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.169
- Fuck!
- Hmm.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.704
Fuck indeed.

47:21.706 --> 47:24.473
- I don't think this qualifies
as murder though.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.842
- Oh, no?

47:26.511 --> 47:28.678
- We offered them the cookies.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.947
We didn't make them eat them.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.616
- I don't think that's gonna
stand up in a court of law.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.451
- Probably not.
- Probably not!

47:35.453 --> 47:36.552
- Oh...

47:36.554 --> 47:38.387
(sniffing)

47:45.697 --> 47:47.463
- Son-of-a-fucking-bitch.

47:47.465 --> 47:50.132
- What should we do
with the bodies?

47:50.134 --> 47:51.701
(sighing)

47:52.237 --> 47:53.970
- Maybe we could...

47:54.572 --> 47:56.806
just drag them
to their apartment.

47:58.243 --> 48:00.243
- Let's do that.

48:00.245 --> 48:02.311
- Okey-dokey.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.384
- Hey.
- Yeah?

48:11.656 --> 48:13.556
- You did good.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.426
- Uh...
Yeah.

48:17.428 --> 48:21.097
Yeah, in the space of 48 hours, we
started taking drugs and murdering people.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.466
Not sure I...

48:23.868 --> 48:26.402
... "did good"  here.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.906
- It was either us or them.

48:30.441 --> 48:32.341
- Maybe you're right.

48:33.945 --> 48:35.811
(wheezing from the living room)

48:40.251 --> 48:42.184
- What the hell was that?!

48:43.254 --> 48:45.187
- Wait here.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.826
(wheezing)

48:59.537 --> 49:00.603
(grunting)

49:09.614 --> 49:10.713
(neck cracking)

49:12.417 --> 49:14.650
(thud!)
(glass shattering)

49:18.389 --> 49:21.290
(breathing deeply)

49:23.795 --> 49:26.228
- What the actual...

49:26.230 --> 49:27.830
fuck...?

49:28.266 --> 49:30.299
- They must've been infected.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.569
Maybe we all are.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.508
(tense music)

49:42.280 --> 49:43.713
(sniffing)

49:44.649 --> 49:46.549
Shit! Goddammit!

49:48.119 --> 49:50.486
- Son-of-a-goddamn-shit-bitch.

49:52.256 --> 49:54.190
- This is serious shit.

49:56.260 --> 49:57.793
- Dead serious.

49:57.795 --> 50:00.730
- We should probably
get some sleep.

50:11.275 --> 50:13.242
- It's the Valium.

50:16.614 --> 50:19.849
(soldier, over PA system): <i>Do not
come to us, we will come to you.</i>

50:20.952 --> 50:24.286
<i>Do not come out! I repeat, do not come out.</i>
(helicopter hovering)

50:24.288 --> 50:26.789
<i>Turn on a light in your
windows so we can see you.</i>

50:26.791 --> 50:29.458
<i>Do not come to us,
we will come to you.</i>

50:29.460 --> 50:33.562
<i>I repeat, do not come out.
Do not come out!</i>

50:33.564 --> 50:37.967
<i>If you're in, turn on a light in
your windows so we can see you.</i>

50:37.969 --> 50:41.437
<i>Do not come to us.
We will come to you.</i>

50:51.549 --> 50:52.915
- Hi.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.785
What's going on?

50:56.921 --> 51:00.189
- Every day could be our last.

51:00.191 --> 51:02.725
So why not be
who you want to be?

51:03.494 --> 51:05.728
If I'm gonna go out, I'm...

51:08.166 --> 51:10.566
...gonna go out being myself.

51:11.169 --> 51:13.235
Sit down. I'll...

51:14.672 --> 51:16.839
I'll make you some breakfast.

51:27.085 --> 51:29.351
- What's this?

51:29.353 --> 51:31.454
- Ecstasy.

51:32.023 --> 51:34.190
- Oh...

51:36.027 --> 51:38.227
I see...

51:38.229 --> 51:40.729
(classical music)

51:40.731 --> 51:42.932
(jungle soundscape)

51:51.442 --> 51:54.076
- I've been thinking.

51:54.078 --> 51:55.377
- Okay.

51:55.379 --> 51:57.880
- If we make it
out of here alive,

51:57.882 --> 52:00.616
I want to adopt a child.

52:03.554 --> 52:04.954
- Sure.

52:06.824 --> 52:08.724
Let's do it.

52:11.629 --> 52:14.029
- I have a lot of love to give.

52:14.732 --> 52:16.899
And when there's no outlet
for it,

52:17.335 --> 52:19.235
it turns into this...

52:20.338 --> 52:24.473
negative, destructive thing

52:25.009 --> 52:26.909
that I keep bottled up.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.577
And all these...

52:29.180 --> 52:30.880
raging emotions...

52:32.350 --> 52:34.416
...fighting to get out.

52:35.753 --> 52:37.253
- I know.

52:38.356 --> 52:40.656
- But that's over now.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.592
I want to start living again.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.596
- I've never stopped loving you.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.234
- I guess I never stopped
loving you, either.

52:53.771 --> 52:55.404
Maybe...

52:57.341 --> 52:59.408
a part of that love...

53:01.312 --> 53:03.245
died when...

53:06.717 --> 53:08.184
- Well.

53:10.021 --> 53:11.620
I suppose I'll have to make you

53:11.622 --> 53:13.889
fall in love with me
all over again.

53:15.026 --> 53:17.259
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.896
- How are you gonna do that?

53:22.867 --> 53:24.900
- Let's get reacquainted.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.772
- I'd like that.

53:32.210 --> 53:34.743
- Would you like
to go on a date with me?

53:38.816 --> 53:40.883
You know, I'm very happy
you said yes.

53:40.885 --> 53:42.418
(chuckling)

53:44.855 --> 53:46.655
- Thank you.

53:47.258 --> 53:50.426
So, tell me about you.
Who is John?

53:51.262 --> 53:53.495
Gonna powder my nose.
- Okay.

53:54.999 --> 53:56.832
- Uh, well...

53:59.503 --> 54:01.237
I...

54:02.273 --> 54:04.440
I guess I'm a guy who...

54:04.442 --> 54:06.508
who lost his way in life.

54:08.613 --> 54:11.680
I met this great, amazing,
beautiful girl.

54:11.682 --> 54:14.683
We fell madly in love
with one another.

54:15.086 --> 54:18.354
All we wanted to do was
multiply that love.

54:20.925 --> 54:24.193
Things in life don't work out
how you want them to.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.667
For various reasons.

54:35.273 --> 54:37.139
See, our thing was that
we... we...

54:37.141 --> 54:39.208
we couldn't get pregnant.

54:40.978 --> 54:42.444
(softly): Oh...

54:45.650 --> 54:46.849
- But...

54:48.386 --> 54:51.487
That was a huge...

54:52.089 --> 54:55.224
a huge disappointment in life
for both of us.

55:00.965 --> 55:03.699
The thing about life is
you have all these...

55:04.435 --> 55:06.602
ideas about how you want it
to turn out,

55:06.604 --> 55:08.504
and then, it doesn't
turn out that way.

55:08.506 --> 55:09.838
So...

55:12.143 --> 55:13.676
I withdrew.

55:13.678 --> 55:17.513
I hid within myself
and behind my job.

55:22.286 --> 55:24.386
But then, something happened.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.391
- What?
(chuckling)

55:32.463 --> 55:34.296
- The end of the world.

55:34.298 --> 55:36.231
(laughing)

55:37.668 --> 55:39.468
- And then what?

55:39.470 --> 55:41.870
- Then, it kind of...

55:42.640 --> 55:45.641
Yeah, it kind of gave me
a perspective on things.

55:45.643 --> 55:47.943
You know, that happiness,
my happiness

55:47.945 --> 55:49.345
can be determined by...

55:49.347 --> 55:51.580
can be determined
by what I've got,

55:52.283 --> 55:54.516
and not necessarily...

55:55.286 --> 55:57.519
by what I can't have.

56:04.295 --> 56:05.694
So...

56:06.297 --> 56:07.863
all I'm...

56:09.300 --> 56:11.400
really wanting is, uh... is...

56:12.470 --> 56:14.837
is another chance.

56:14.839 --> 56:17.406
(classical piano music)

56:20.978 --> 56:23.645
- I think we both kind of
lost our way there.

56:23.647 --> 56:25.881
(pouring wine)
- Mm-hmm.

56:26.650 --> 56:29.418
But the thing about losing
your way is that there's...

56:29.820 --> 56:32.554
there's always a chance
of finding it again.

56:36.494 --> 56:38.994
- We lost our way pretty badly,
though.

56:38.996 --> 56:41.397
- True. Sure.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.566
So, maybe the way back
is a little longer.

56:46.170 --> 56:48.237
So what? If we're both...

56:49.006 --> 56:51.573
willing to try.

56:53.010 --> 56:55.344
And you know, maybe it's true
what they say,

56:55.346 --> 56:58.580
that the main thing
is the journey.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.083
- Who are "they"?

57:02.520 --> 57:03.952
I've always wondered.

57:03.954 --> 57:05.521
- Christ, me too.

57:05.523 --> 57:07.189
- Well, if we find them,

57:07.191 --> 57:09.858
I'll just bake them
some oat cookies.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.527
- Oh, yes. Definitely.

57:17.701 --> 57:19.535
- What are we watching?

57:19.537 --> 57:21.103
- Notting Hill.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.873
- Okay.

57:24.875 --> 57:27.109
(classical music)

57:37.621 --> 57:40.355
- You're still the most
beautiful thing I know.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.533
(knocking on door)

57:56.674 --> 57:58.207
- Maybe that's them.

57:58.843 --> 58:00.542
(knocking on door)

58:04.081 --> 58:06.014
They must have seen the X's!

58:06.283 --> 58:08.617
Who is it?
(man): Rescue team, ma'am.

58:08.619 --> 58:11.119
We're here to bring you out.
- It's the rescue team!

58:11.121 --> 58:13.489
- No, no, don't open the door!
No, no!

58:13.491 --> 58:14.923
(screaming)

58:16.327 --> 58:17.893
(grunting)

58:20.965 --> 58:22.764
- Sit!

58:23.133 --> 58:25.834
Shh...
Shut up!

58:26.704 --> 58:29.505
- I'm not sure
if they're still following us.

58:33.277 --> 58:35.344
- No, I don't think so.

58:39.049 --> 58:41.517
(woman panting)
Oh...

58:42.286 --> 58:43.619
Look what we have here.

58:43.621 --> 58:45.454
A couple people
that hasn't run away yet.

58:45.456 --> 58:47.556
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

58:48.626 --> 58:52.060
We seen that your light is still on.
Everyone else is gone.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.962
So what do you have to hide?

58:53.964 --> 58:55.430
- Nothing.

58:56.300 --> 58:58.967
We're not hiding anything.
There's nothing of value here.

58:58.969 --> 59:00.903
- Really?

59:04.742 --> 59:06.542
(John): It's okay.

59:08.479 --> 59:09.678
It's okay.

59:09.680 --> 59:13.248
- So what's she worth to you?
- Everything.

59:13.250 --> 59:15.317
- You have five minutes...

59:15.319 --> 59:17.319
to go in and collect your money,

59:17.321 --> 59:19.488
your jewelry, your valuables
or whatever,

59:19.490 --> 59:22.991
or I smash her beautiful,
little face in. Hmm?

59:24.495 --> 59:27.162
- She's the only thing
worth any value to me.

59:27.164 --> 59:29.731
- Then, maybe
we should take her.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.567
What do you think?

59:32.503 --> 59:34.169
(crying)

59:34.171 --> 59:36.138
- Yeah, maybe we should.

59:39.276 --> 59:41.677
Take this little whiny twat
in there.

59:41.679 --> 59:42.744
- Get up.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.212
- And you...

59:44.214 --> 59:46.214
You are coming with me.
(woman yelping)

59:46.216 --> 59:48.884
Don't you fucking try anything!
- No! Don't touch her!

59:48.886 --> 59:50.886
- What are you gonna do
about it?

59:50.888 --> 59:52.187
(crying)

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.128
- Please.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.532
- Please...? Please, what?

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:06.435
Please, fuck me?

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:10.138
(men arguing in the other room)

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.207
Huh? What?

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.376
Am I ugly or something?

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:19.147
(breathing heavily)

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.120
(faintly): Yeah, okay...
- Yeah, okay.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:28.290
Okay, what? I'm ugly?

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.126
Or yeah, okay, fuck me?

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:35.964
Yeah, whatever.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.899
You guys alright?

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.802
(man): Yeah, they got
a lot of crap!

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.671
(grunting)
- Oh, fuck!

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.139
(grunting)
(coughing)

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.177
(grunting)

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:00.422
(choking)

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:02.658
- Say please.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.199
Don't touch it.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.441
- What the fuck did you do!?

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.177
Come on, wake up.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.714
It was her.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:28.684
- Don't you fucking touch her!
(gunshots)

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:36.191
- Please, please.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.060
Wait.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.795
(gunshots)

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:41.463
(thud!)

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:51.106
- You're alright?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.545
They're not fucking worthy.
Fuck them.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:01.149
(eerie music)

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:17.599
- It's so quiet.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.572
It's like we're the only
two people left in the world.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:27.509
- That'd be nice.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.422
(whirring in the distance)

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.966
(soldier, over PA system):
<i>Do not come out.</i>

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.935
<i>I repeat, do not come out.
Come to your windows so we can see you.</i>

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.771
- We're in here!
- Hey!

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.140
- Stop!

01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:00.208
(screaming)
(helicopter hovering by)

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.645
- Help!
- Come back!

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:06.214
- Wait!

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:08.383
- They're not seeing us.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.685
- What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.955
- Make a run for it?

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.631
(moaning)

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.649
(tense music)

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:49.558
Oh, fuck, they're gone.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:55.163
(panting)

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:02.003
- We're almost out of food.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.008
There's a shitload
of infected fuckers out there

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.044
and they know we're in here.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.046
We don't stand a chance.

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:13.615
- Hey, hey.

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:15.951
We just...

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.621
Let's rest up.
We need to sleep.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.257
Okay?

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.626
And then...

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.964
Then, we plan our escape.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.418
(sharpening knife)

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:54.322
(door creaking)

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.725
Morning.

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:59.160
Or evening.

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.162
I've...

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:03.565
I've laid some clothes out
for you on the sofa.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.500
The knives are sharpened.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.071
Gun's loaded. And there's fresh
batteries in the torch.

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:17.245
Are you ready for this?

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.183
- I won't be any more ready
tomorrow.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.757
- We're gonna be alright.

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:33.428
(soft music)

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.434
We just chop through.

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:15.570
(growling outside the door)
We don't stop and fight.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.573
We just chop and keep going.

01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:27.649
- I just want to say...

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:35.156
You won my love back.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:40.562
I love you now more than ever.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:43.331
I want you to know that.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:00.849
(grunting)

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:03.385
(gunshots)

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:08.356
(gunshots)

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.842
(gunshots)

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:29.611
(footsteps approaching)

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.614
(panting)

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:35.717
- Oh, fuck.

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:41.423
Fuck!

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:43.758
(scratching against the wall)

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:48.897
We should go regroup.
Okay?

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.166
We should go think.

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:54.035
For a moment.
For a moment...

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:57.238
- We can't be the only ones
left, right?

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.344
Thanks.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.457
(sighing)

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.359
- What is it?

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:21.763
- When we were...

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:25.767
...running out
of the warehouse...

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.438
...one of them bit me...

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.145
before I could get away.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:42.550
(crying)

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.853
- If... well,
if you are infected,

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.689
maybe it won't break out
whilst you're still alive.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:52.160
So we just keep you alive.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.229
We just keep you alive.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.633
I mean, there's probably
a vaccine out there by now.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.069
There's probably been one
all along.

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.073
I...

01:09:06.076 --> 01:09:08.009
I guarantee, I think there's...

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:10.745
...some pharmaceutical company

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.715
that's just waiting
to cash in on their vaccine.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.551
So it's gonna be okay.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.157
Yeah.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:35.270
- Wow!

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.509
Thank you.

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:52.086
(growling)

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:13.374
(gasping)

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.723
(gasping)
(panting)

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:44.405
(growling outside the door)

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.747
(John): Where are you going?

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:57.752
- I had a nightmare.

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:01.589
- So you're just gonna take off?

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.471
- There's something growing
inside me.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:23.144
There's this...

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.781
hunger.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:34.322
A hunger that just keeps...

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:37.625
growing.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.801
- I have an idea.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.915
(breathing deeply)

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.951
- What the fuck are you doing?!

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:05.486
- Shh...

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:11.192
Here.
Now, you drink that.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.961
- I'm not a fucking vampire!

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.663
- Drink it!

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:30.345
Let's just see if this makes
a difference to... to whether...

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:39.620
Well?

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.292
It isn't working?

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:50.465
- No, it is.

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:56.304
It is working.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.282
- Okay.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:13.287
- But you can't...
keep doing this.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.390
- Look.

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:19.894
We'll just keep you afloat
until help arrives.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.931
They'll have a vaccine.
They will have a vaccine, yes.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.367
This is just some...
- Some what?

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:30.838
Some fucking pharmaceutical
company trying to cash in?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.273
- Exactly.

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.577
Let's just see if this keeps
your hunger at bay.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:37.712
- It's no use.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.747
(yelling): This is what
we're doing!

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.283
It's my choice!

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.154
Alright?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.292
It's my choice.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:54.162
It's my fucking choice.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:57.799
Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:01.269
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.776
- I can smell your wound.

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:14.282
Go. Now, go clean it.

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:18.152
Cover it up. Go, go now!

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.791
Today, we try it your way.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:28.362
Tomorrow,

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.466
I get to decide what I do.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.805
(classical music)

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.643
(John sighing)

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.314
- Nothing?

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.484
- Nothing at all.

01:14:52.422 --> 01:14:55.156
Like the whole world's
come to a halt.

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:02.497
- Are you...

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:04.265
hungry?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.100
- Stop it.
- But...

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:10.505
- Rest assured, I'll let you
know when I'm... hungry, okay?

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:15.176
- But, if...

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:18.279
today is gonna be my day,

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:21.516
I want the day to be perfect.

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:27.688
- So do I.
- That's good.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.893
Come this way.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.160
Over here.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:35.196
We're gonna sit down.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:39.901
Because there's something
I want to talk to you about.

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:41.702
- Okay...

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:45.139
What do you want to talk
to me about?

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:56.484
- Our future.

01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:01.722
Because this is how I see
everything playing out now.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.758
Now... tomorrow...

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:09.764
we're gonna wake up to the
sound of a knocking at the door.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.265
(knocking)

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.833
It's the rescue team.

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.336
(indistinct dialogue, soldier)
Obviously, I'm right.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:18.472
There is a vaccine.
(chuckling)

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.008
But...

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.643
- But?

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:28.316
- The vaccine has a side-effect
that we don't...

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.487
we don't really notice it
at first.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.324
But then, you...

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:39.493
you start to get a little sick.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.463
In the mornings.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.435
- And...

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:51.672
around nine months later...

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.613
she arrives.

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:00.247
(baby crying)

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.316
Our first-born child.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:05.086
- First-born?

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:07.088
- Yeah.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:11.225
Because a year later,
we'll have Luke.

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:13.794
- Little Luke.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.330
We'll need a bigger house.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:19.800
That's fine because...

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:25.072
I would've been promoted
to head teacher by then,

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:28.242
so we can finally get that
big old house in the country.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:31.512
- And we'll have a greenhouse.
(birdsong)

01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:34.782
Where we...
- Grow our weed.

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.350
(chuckling)

01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:38.953
- Yeah.

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:41.522
And our tomatoes.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.824
- Really?
- Mm.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:47.695
Both our kids,
they'll want to go to uni.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:52.099
- We'll be proud parents.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:54.502
- But no matter
how much we love them...

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.206
we'll be pleased
to see them leave.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.941
- Why is that?

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.477
(whispering): Because
we can fuck like rabbits.

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:05.513
(laughing)

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.785
- And we'll have
loads of grandchildren.

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.353
And the thing...

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:16.123
the thing we'll look forward to
the most every year

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.959
will be spending Christmas,

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:22.263
together, with the whole family.

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:24.632
A crazy big family.

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:25.966
- Ginormous.

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:27.702
- Yeah. That's right.

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:35.643
- But the thing I'll look
forward to more than anything...

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:40.648
is that I get
to grow old with you.

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:52.793
- True.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:57.798
I want that more than anything
in this world.

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:00.801
- It'll be alright.

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:06.340
- I think I'm gonna take a bath.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:20.488
(water running)

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.213
(grunting)

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.195
(knocking)

01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:08.169
- Hi.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.512
There you go.

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:22.516
- But honey--
- It's fine.

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.769
(door closing)

01:20:41.771 --> 01:20:43.704
(breathing deeply)

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:01.856
(breathing shakily)

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:41.629
No muffins?

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.834
- No muffins needed today.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.574
(classical music)

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.696
(woman's voice):
<i>"My darling, honey,</i>

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:26.166
<i>there's only one word
that sums you up:</i>

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.402
<i>perfect.</i>

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:32.506
<i>I had gotten myself
into a dark place,</i>

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.275
<i>but you pulled me back
into the light.</i>

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:37.945
<i>You were my lighthouse,</i>

01:23:37.947 --> 01:23:40.414
<i>guiding me safely to shore.</i>

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:44.885
<i>I'm not lost anymore.</i>

01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:48.455
<i>I'm so happy that I met you,</i>

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:51.725
<i>and that you chose me.</i>

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.562
<i>Our children love you,</i>

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:59.233
<i>and I loved
growing old with you.</i>

01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:03.570
<i>When I look back on it,
my life has been perfect.</i>

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:06.807
<i>And it's all thanks to you."</i>

01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:08.475
Thank you.

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:11.211
<i>"That's my reality.</i>

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:14.381
<i>It's what I'm taking with me.</i>

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:19.153
<i>In my nightmare, however,</i>

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.488
<i>the hunger took over.</i>

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:23.590
<i>In the end,
I couldn't fight it,</i>

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:26.727
<i>and I couldn't let
it take you.</i>

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:31.498
<i>Unfortunately
I don't know how to end it,</i>

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.235
<i>so I'm asking you
for one last thing.</i>

01:24:36.005 --> 01:24:38.238
<i>End my nightmare.</i>

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.242
<i>You'll find it in the nursery.</i>

01:24:43.012 --> 01:24:45.846
<i>I love you, always.</i>

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:47.481
<i>Karen."</i>

01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:46.540
(gasping)

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.810
(crying)

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:56.850
(chains rattling)

01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:10.831
(moaning)

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:33.253
-<i> You died first.</i>

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:40.928
But the funeral's... beautiful.

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:47.534
People thought I was nuts to put
a vine of tomatoes in your coffin.

01:26:52.174 --> 01:26:54.374
<i>But you know why I did.</i>

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:57.578
I kept having Christmases
at our house.

01:26:59.215 --> 01:27:01.248
The kids would come.

01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:07.321
The grandkids would come.

01:27:10.359 --> 01:27:11.892
And we'd drink to you.

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:14.261
Every single year.

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:18.932
<i>You know,
I've never met anyone new.</i>

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.637
You gave me all the love
that I ever needed.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:28.575
I continued
to live for a while.

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.080
Then, I quietly pass away.

01:27:33.382 --> 01:27:34.781
<i>Although, I...</i>

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.452
I don't really know what
happened after that point.

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:42.055
I like to think that we...

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:46.260
we continue to create
magical adventures together.

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:50.430
For the rest of eternity.

01:27:57.206 --> 01:27:59.306
(crying softly)

01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:11.285
(gun cocking)

01:28:17.226 --> 01:28:19.293
(closing door)

01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:40.814
Forgive me.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:57.597
(soft music)

01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:10.610
(bang!)

01:29:16.985 --> 01:29:19.319
(soldier): This one was marked
with an X, too.

01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:22.622
Is anybody here?

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.729
- Check every room.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:34.301
- There's no one here.

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:40.407
- I heard something.
Over there.

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:43.577
- Be careful.
There's something in there.

01:29:43.579 --> 01:29:47.047
- Ready?
- On three. 1, 2...

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.615
Go!

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:51.551
- Watch it.

01:29:57.025 --> 01:30:00.093
- What the fuck?

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:02.763
(moaning)

01:30:05.534 --> 01:30:07.768
What the hell is this?

01:30:09.204 --> 01:30:11.238
(both wheezing)

01:30:24.386 --> 01:30:26.620
- Why are their arms taped
together?

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:31.291
The fuck are we looking at here?

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.294
- Love.

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:42.936
Johansson.

01:30:43.205 --> 01:30:45.338
Let's hear it.

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:52.379
- "For the purposes

01:31:06.829 --> 01:31:08.762
(growling)

01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:10.564
- We're done here.

01:31:10.566 --> 01:31:12.799
Let's clear the place.

01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.649
(gunshots)

01:31:45.434 --> 01:31:47.667
