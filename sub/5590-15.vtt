00:01.435 --> 00:03.702
<i> Previously on "nashville"...</i>
That's autumn chase.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.137
Bucky: Rayna heard she was
looking for a opening act.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.305
What do you mean,
she picked us?

00:06.307 --> 00:07.139
She came to see layla.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.207
Maddie:
I keep thinking

00:08.209 --> 00:09.608
I shouldn't have
broken up with him.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.876
Maybe something's wrong.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.479
Putting your feelings
down on paper makes it easier.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.214
Deacon:
I'm sure everybody's heard
about vita's disappearance.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.682
The police are on it.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.883
I want justice
for all of them.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.451
I'm gonna do something.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.853
What would you think about
coming out of retirement

00:20.855 --> 00:22.154
And going on the road
with me?

00:22.156 --> 00:24.356
I'd like you to come back
to wheelin' dealin' records,

00:24.358 --> 00:25.524
Juliette: I apologize.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.659
I shouldn't have signed on
to do this movie.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.062
I need to be with my daughter
right now.
Hi!

00:30.064 --> 00:34.199
¶¶

00:34.201 --> 00:35.968
Gunnar: Do you see
all those trucks out there?

00:35.970 --> 00:37.870
She must have
like 20 semis.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.204
Yeah, autumn doesn't do
out-and-back tours.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.372
Everything goes with her.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.074
You okay?
Mm.

00:42.076 --> 00:45.010
Yeah, she's just nervous
about re-meeting autumn chase.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.879
How many words did you say
to her the other night? Seven?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.313
10. And shut up.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.648
You'd freak out
if you met james taylor.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.650
[ laughs ] yeah,
that's 'cause he's james taylor.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.985
Exactly.
She's autumn chase.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.887
Right, not james taylor.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.355
So, we got to fix that.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.757
Oh, hey! Yay!
You guys are here!

00:58.759 --> 01:01.994
Everybody, allow me
to introduce the exes,

01:01.996 --> 01:04.029
Otherwise known
as scarlett o'connor

01:04.031 --> 01:05.230
And gunnar scott.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.198
Man: Hey.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.399
Hey.
Hi.
[ giggles ]

01:07.401 --> 01:08.700
Welcome to my tour!

01:08.702 --> 01:09.568
Thank you.
Hey.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.537
Hey. Good to see you.
You too.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.839
Y'all are gonna love these two
as much as I do.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.275
There is a lot of talent
right here.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.876
Thank you.
[ chuckles ]

01:17.878 --> 01:20.279
You guys grab a seat. We're
doing this weekly tour meeting,

01:20.281 --> 01:22.748
Which you should absolutely
be a part of.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.350
That is what
I love about her.
Yeah, so, as I was saying...

01:25.352 --> 01:27.853
Well, she is...
Certainly charming.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.854
I'll give her that.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.888
She's really amazing.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.356
I want to be
up on that stage

01:31.358 --> 01:33.892
Within 15 minutes
of the exes' bow.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.794
Got that? 15 minutes --
that's the goal.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.296
Um, one more thing.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.698
Danny, how long
have you been with me now?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.100
Six weeks.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.401
That's long enough
for you to figure out

01:42.403 --> 01:44.136
Where you need to be
during my set,

01:44.138 --> 01:45.704
But every time I turn around
to get a guitar,

01:45.706 --> 01:46.738
You're not there.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.307
Grab your gear.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.542
We're gonna get you a flight
back to nashville, okay?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.144
I'm sorry, dude.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.745
All right, thanks, everybody.
See you later.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.266
See ya.
Bye.

01:57.267 --> 01:58.650
Yeah, she's, uh...
Amazing, all right.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.921
Dr. Kitley: How do you feel
about the headlines?

02:02.923 --> 02:06.458
Well, the studio's
suing me.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.760
But it's the best decision
I could have made.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.463
I get to see cadence now
whenever I want.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.631
That's what matters.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.999
How are things
between you and avery?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.168
They're good.
They're all right.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.138
When we talk,
we don't talk for very long,

02:19.140 --> 02:21.740
And we only talk
about cadence.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.677
Um...Guess that's the most
you can expect from an ex.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.346
Sounds like
you're in a good place.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.981
What's got you so antsy?

02:28.983 --> 02:30.582
I miss working.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.685
I miss -- not the movie
or anything like that,

02:33.687 --> 02:38.090
But being onstage and performing
and recording.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.758
What would it take
to get back to it?

02:39.760 --> 02:40.592
Where would you start?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.327
I have no idea.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.029
My old manager, glenn,

02:44.031 --> 02:47.099
He handled all the strategies
and that kind of stuff.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.600
So why not go see him?

02:48.602 --> 02:51.703
¶¶

02:51.705 --> 02:53.872
You had your meeting
with that charity yesterday?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.541
Oh, yeah, fostermore.
How'd it go?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.209
So great.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.711
They are doing amazing work
for these at-risk kids.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.780
Here in nashville,
all over the place.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.148
Yeah?
What'd you promise them?

03:03.150 --> 03:04.349
[ both chuckle ]

03:04.351 --> 03:06.018
Well, let's see.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.720
Um...Brad paisley
fell out of a fundraiser

03:08.722 --> 03:09.688
They got coming up.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.356
I said
I would take his place.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.525
And then I was thinking --
let's do a big show, you know?

03:13.527 --> 03:16.061
I could put a concert together
with a bunch of friends,

03:16.063 --> 03:17.629
Raise a whole bunch
of money.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.464
It's not gonna help vita,
unfortunately,

03:19.466 --> 03:20.966
But it'll help
a lot of kids.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.701
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.970
Well, thank you.
You got it.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.205
[ maddie clears throat ]

03:26.207 --> 03:27.372
[ chuckling ]
hi, honey.
Hi.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.041
I hear you got
a day off school today.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.576
What are you gonna
do with it?

03:30.578 --> 03:33.245
Me and cash are just gonna
write. Nothing really exciting.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.916
How you doing today --
with the breakup and everything?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.551
I'm doing fine, honestly.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.720
I mean, it sucked,
but at the end of the day,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.355
Colt just wasn't my guy,
you know?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.090
Sounds like
you've thought it through.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.825
Yeah.
Cash helped.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.560
We wrote about it.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.263
Yeah, it's a good way
to process it all.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.130
Mm-hmm.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.666
[ chuckling ] what?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.134
You're growing up.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.770
Yeah.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.075
Going in today to talk
about the launch plan.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.344
I'm still kind of amazed
it all happened.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.279
Yeah. Everything sounds
perfect for you.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.750
I'm sorry. I-I didn't...
Mean it like that.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.218
I'm just frustrated.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.954
Avery has no time for me now
that juliette's back in town,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.523
So I feel like
my album's at a standstill.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.093
Are they, like,
hanging out again or something?

04:21.095 --> 04:23.061
They're hardly talking,
actually.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.764
Not everybody has a great
relationship with their ex.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.933
Well,
scarlett and gunnar do.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.636
I was literally all set
to go on tour with autumn,

04:30.638 --> 04:32.070
And they just swooped in.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.872
They didn't exactly<i> swoop.</i>

04:33.874 --> 04:35.607
Look, I still feel
like I got screwed.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.310
I mean, glenn and highway 65
aren't doing anything for me.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.078
I just --
I don't get it.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.213
Jeff always
got things done.

04:41.215 --> 04:44.383
Well, jeff wasn't exactly...
Ethical.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.487
He did whatever it took to win,
but glenn's not like that.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.122
Yeah, he's not.
[ scoffs ]

04:50.124 --> 04:51.556
Which is a<i> good</i> thing.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.925
Because it's aboveboard
and honest, right?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.061
Of course.
[ chuckles ]

04:58.299 --> 04:59.631
How you been doing?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.832
Good. Real good.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.267
Can I get you
something?

05:02.269 --> 05:04.503
No, I'm -- I'm fine.
All right.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.840
Look, I just, um...

05:08.842 --> 05:11.476
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did for my dad.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.779
Nothing he wouldn't have
done for<i> me.</i>

05:13.781 --> 05:16.148
Thank you for everything
you're doing for maddie.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.516
Oh, she is
one talented girl.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.117
And I just want
to make sure

05:19.119 --> 05:20.819
That she reaches
her full potential.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.521
Well, we're
on the same page there.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.056
She's waiting for you.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.664
Hey.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.966
Talia said
that colt joined the army.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.368
And he didn't call
and tell you?

05:36.370 --> 05:37.703
No.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.806
Wow. I'd be pretty mad
about that.

05:40.808 --> 05:44.209
I'm more jealous
than anything.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.777
I mean, not the fact
that he joined the army,

05:45.779 --> 05:49.314
But just that he can make
his own choices in life.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.683
Look,
feeling trapped sucks.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.687
But maybe it'll make
good fodder for a song.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.556
What is the point
of writing any

05:57.558 --> 06:00.258
If no one will ever hear them
outside of this room?

06:00.260 --> 06:03.161
Look, I thought the same way
when I was your age.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.364
I wanted to
get in front of people so badly

06:05.366 --> 06:07.632
That I actually snuck out
and played cafés.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.402
Wait.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.603
What if I do that, too?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.540
Oh, no, maddie. I didn't
tell you that to encourage you.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.075
I mean, what would
your parents do?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.677
No, they don't have to
find out.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.747
If I don't get out on a stage
with my own music soon...

06:21.749 --> 06:23.548
Cash, it is<i> killing</i> me.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.217
Please.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.420
These are
the quarterly numbers

06:28.422 --> 06:30.522
For us to go over
with the accountants.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.757
Really?

06:31.759 --> 06:33.492
Yes, we are
in the black. Yay.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.926
But we're gonna
have to move some funds around

06:34.928 --> 06:36.862
To cover payroll
and pension contributions.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.663
What?

06:38.665 --> 06:41.700
Well, you know all this
spreadsheets and whatnot --

06:41.702 --> 06:43.702
Not exactly my favorite part
of the process.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.170
Well, I hear you,
but they are giving you

06:45.172 --> 06:46.705
A pretty great
second chapter.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.608
Or, at least,
so says<i> businessweek.</i>

06:49.610 --> 06:51.443
Hits newsstands today.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.712
You have officially arrived,
madame ceo.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.348
I-I feel like
that makes it sound like...

06:56.350 --> 06:59.184
There was some first chapter
that's over.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.752
Well, I thought last week
you liked it better than

07:00.754 --> 07:03.688
The "rayna jaymes:
Musician to mogul" thing.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.257
Well, yeah, it's better
than that, but...

07:05.259 --> 07:06.258
But what?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.561
Nothing.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.962
What else we got going on?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.098
Uh, well, we're all set
to fly to dallas tonight

07:13.100 --> 07:14.533
For the exes' first show
with autumn.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.201
Okay, good.
And what's happening with layla?

07:16.203 --> 07:17.869
And that's where
my news gets bad.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.871
Unfortunately,
I can't find a tour for her.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.974
So I thought maybe we go
smaller, something regional.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.143
We can't do that. That's gonna
underserve the album.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.279
And we've got to really launch
this thing in the right way.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.547
Well, I can keep calling,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.882
But I've talked
to every active tour out there.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.385
Maybe we need to think
outside the box a little bit.

07:33.387 --> 07:37.322
I mean, we do know an artist
who has a very devoted fan base.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.924
Who's that?

07:38.926 --> 07:40.792
Me.

07:42.763 --> 07:43.929
Hi.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.597
Sorry to just stop by.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.232
What are you doing here?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.800
I was hoping
that I could talk to you.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.502
Look, I'm sorry.
I got a meeting right now.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.237
Glenn. Please.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.673
I know we haven't always
seen eye-to-eye,

07:54.675 --> 07:56.741
And I haven't been
the most professional,

07:56.743 --> 07:59.511
But I promise you I will be
your dream client from now on.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.912
Juliette, look.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.982
The truth is --
two of us the last few years,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.251
We weren't a great team.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.487
You fired and rehired me
every couple of months,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.288
We were rarely
on the same page,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.257
It was one crisis
after the next.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.291
I can be different.
No, no, no.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.493
I'm not what you need.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.094
Go get a fresh start
with somebody else.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.429
You're gonna wind up
someplace great.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.604
¶¶

08:34.648 --> 08:36.448
You want to put together a tour
for you and layla

08:36.450 --> 08:37.883
Over the next few weeks.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.618
I kind of feel like
we're out of options.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.387
You know, we could tie it
to the charity concert,

08:42.389 --> 08:44.122
And then I just go out
with layla from there.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.991
Right, but there's no way
we can put together a full tour

08:45.993 --> 08:47.292
On such short notice.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.827
We could do 10 dates
in major markets,

08:48.829 --> 08:50.362
And that would launch
the album.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.697
It'd be a crazy schedule,
assuming there are openings --

08:52.699 --> 08:53.999
A lot a cross-country hops.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.001
Why don't we just push
layla's album launch?

08:56.003 --> 08:57.335
We can get a tour
in six months.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.170
After all this momentum
that we've built?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.305
We've been working
so hard.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.073
We've got radio
so excited about her,

09:02.075 --> 09:03.475
Prime placement
in stores.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.809
[ sighs ]

09:04.811 --> 09:06.344
Do you really want
to be gone right now?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.079
I thought you wanted to be
at home as much as possible

09:08.081 --> 09:09.014
Through the end
of the school year.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.583
I did,
but I feel like...

09:11.585 --> 09:13.852
Things at home
have calmed down a little bit,

09:13.854 --> 09:16.254
And I just feel like we need
to do this layla, you know?

09:16.256 --> 09:19.324
She needs it, and we're
making it happen for the exes.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.825
We got to do
the same for her.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.160
All right.
I'll make the calls.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.995
Good.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.664
Tour's looking great.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.899
We got sold-out shows all
the way till the end of the run.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.834
And you weren't a fan
of bringing riff on. Carol!

09:29.836 --> 09:31.269
[ chuckling ]
well, I stand corrected.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.071
You know what we should do --
we should definitely capitalize

09:33.073 --> 09:34.439
On the exposure
we're generating

09:34.441 --> 09:36.775
And maybe add one of your
baby artists to open for y'all.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.109
That's a great idea.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.211
I'll, uh,
I'll pick one tonight

09:40.213 --> 09:41.713
And have them join us
at the re-launch

09:41.715 --> 09:42.681
At the bridgestone tomorrow.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.949
Thank you.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.417
Well, I urge you
to consider an artist

09:45.419 --> 09:46.918
Who's close
to launching an album,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.219
Not someone
new to the label.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.121
By which,
you mean will lexington.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.456
Look, I like the kid
just fine.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.625
I-it's just gonna be
an uphill battle to launch him.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.060
Yeah, don't worry.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.129
I won't put him on the bill yet,
but he is in the family now,

09:58.131 --> 10:00.065
Which means you need
to get on board.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.399
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

10:01.401 --> 10:02.634
No, no, will.
Come on in.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.135
Just straightening
a few things out.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.770
We clear, kenneth?
We are.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.806
Hey.
Hey.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.407
Hey, will. Sorry.
Have a seat.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.042
Thank you so much
for squeezing us in

10:11.044 --> 10:13.311
Before I head out on the road
tomorrow. [ chuckles ]

10:13.313 --> 10:14.412
Yeah, no.
No worries.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.081
So, listen --
I talked to my team

10:16.083 --> 10:17.582
About you
coming back into the fold.

10:17.584 --> 10:18.883
Yeah, I'm guessing
they weren't too excited

10:18.885 --> 10:20.585
To hear you re-signed me.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.221
Doesn't matter what<i> they</i> think.
It matters what<i> I</i> think.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.724
The way I see it,
you are an amazing artist.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.125
Period, end of story.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.593
Your music is
the selling point.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.061
Thank you.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.429
Now, I was going back
through your songs,

10:31.431 --> 10:32.998
And, uh, some of the tracks
still need some work.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.633
Yeah, sure.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.268
I know y'all broke up,
but I'm hoping you'd be amenable

10:37.270 --> 10:39.437
To working with kevin
on this.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.072
Would that be weird?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.273
Uh, no, no.
Not at all.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.742
You sure, will?
Yeah, you know what?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.310
I had breakfast with layla
this morning.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.444
If I can get along
with my ex-wife,

10:46.446 --> 10:47.979
I can definitely
work with kevin.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.247
It'd be good to see him.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.616
Yeah, great, will.
Thank you so much.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.252
I talked to the guy afterwards.
He was nice.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.820
He said he'd only
ever screwed up once,

10:55.822 --> 10:57.656
But she fired him
anyway.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.858
[ sighs ] see, this is why you
should never meet your idols.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.593
They're never as cool
as you want them to be.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.762
Except james taylor.
I'm sure he's awesome.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.130
Well,
that was demeaning --

11:05.132 --> 11:07.332
Firing a person in front
of everybody like that.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.533
I didn't expect that
from her.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.635
Scarlett. It's not exactly
out of character.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.203
How do you think
you got this gig?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.938
She fired
her last opening act.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.140
Seriously?
What for?

11:15.142 --> 11:16.641
I don't know.
I don't care.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.878
The important thing is
that she doesn't fire the exes.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.313
So, how about y'all do me
a favor and don't piss her off?

11:22.315 --> 11:24.249
When have I
ever pissed anyone off?

11:25.686 --> 11:27.819
Lately.
Okay, look --
just be cool.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.487
You have a single
launching tomorrow,

11:29.489 --> 11:31.122
And this tour
is getting you

11:31.124 --> 11:33.158
In front of the biggest audience
of your career.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.060
[ both sigh ]

11:35.062 --> 11:36.695
Now, autumn's gonna
have dinner with you

11:36.697 --> 11:38.296
Before the show, okay?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.498
So whatever she says,
whatever she thinks,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.967
Whatever she feels,
the answer is "yes."

11:42.969 --> 11:44.302
You got it?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.804
Yes.

11:48.642 --> 11:51.042
All right.
Billy's in if you are.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.711
It's skull's rainbow room --
super-underground.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.212
Well, that's good.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.015
Then there's no way my parents
have ever heard of it.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.317
So, what do you think?
You want to do this?

11:59.319 --> 12:02.320
I'm in. You talk to billy,
and I will handle my parents.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.264
Come on in!

12:13.266 --> 12:16.000
Hey. Sorry I've been
a little awol lately.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.368
We still on
for this afternoon?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.404
No, actually, I have to cancel.
I'm sorry.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.006
Um, something's come up.
I think I have a lead on a tour.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.441
But I'll call you later?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.110
Cool.
Let me know how it goes.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.613
Hi.
Hey.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.583
I thought you weren't coming by
for cadence until later.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.918
I found her pacifier
in the car,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.588
And I knew
that she would want it, so...

12:36.590 --> 12:38.556
Ah, okay.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.824
Is there
something else?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.927
Does glenn hate me?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.196
[ chuckles ]
where is this coming from?

12:45.198 --> 12:47.699
Well, I stopped by his office
to apologize,

12:47.701 --> 12:50.468
And I was really professional
and mature,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.570
And he wanted
nothing to do with me.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.205
Were you honest with him

12:54.207 --> 12:56.975
About why you want
to have him back?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.577
Well, it's obvious --
he's the best manager in town,

12:59.579 --> 13:00.945
And I want
to get back to work --

13:00.947 --> 13:03.148
Come on. There are a lot
of great managers in town.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.349
That's --
that's not why.

13:06.219 --> 13:06.951
Fine.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.787
I've...

13:08.789 --> 13:10.789
I've been with him
since I was 14,

13:10.791 --> 13:13.158
And I don't know
how to do this without him.

13:15.762 --> 13:19.998
Why is it so hard for you
to admit when you need people?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.332
You know what?

13:21.334 --> 13:25.403
It doesn't even matter,
'cause...He hates me, so...

13:25.405 --> 13:29.007
He doesn't hate you,
juliette.

13:29.009 --> 13:33.111
I think that you hurt him,
and he's protecting himself.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.613
Well, I think
I'm just gonna let it go.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.648
Really?

13:36.650 --> 13:38.249
The juliette
I used to know

13:38.251 --> 13:40.285
[chuckles] wouldn't take "no"
for an answer.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.920
Well, the juliette
you used to know

13:41.922 --> 13:43.755
Did some terrible things,

13:43.757 --> 13:46.090
And, uh, people
didn't like her very much.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.859
That's not true.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.195
I mean, she was challenging.
Don't get me wrong.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.131
But she was also
passionate, and...

13:53.133 --> 13:55.633
There was a lot
to love about her.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.167
Yeah?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.273
All I'm saying is
that if it's important

14:02.275 --> 14:04.175
For glenn
to hear the truth,

14:04.177 --> 14:05.944
Then you should
make him hear it.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.379
Don't give up.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.648
Will you help me?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.483
What did you have
in mind?

14:12.485 --> 14:13.952
I don't know.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.088
Maybe...Something the old
juliette would approve of.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.397
Well, looky here.
Hey.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.399
That's a sight I ain't seen
in a long time.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.868
I know.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.569
[ sighs ]

14:31.571 --> 14:33.371
I had an idea for a lyric,
and I thought,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.039
"I'd better write it down
before it's gone."

14:35.041 --> 14:36.708
Aren't you
going to dallas?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.710
Yeah, in a bit, um...

14:38.712 --> 14:40.545
And, hey, come here.
What?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.882
Next time I get on a plane,
you're coming with me.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.050
Oh, yeah? [ chuckles ]
for what? The charity show?

14:46.052 --> 14:49.153
For that,
and also, uh...

14:49.155 --> 14:51.389
We couldn't find
a major tour for layla,

14:51.391 --> 14:54.659
And so I'm taking her
out on tour with me

14:54.661 --> 14:55.994
So we can get
her album launched.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.864
Wait, wait, wait.
You're going on tour?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.200
Yeah, and I want you to come
with us. That's the whole point.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.902
Well, I don't see
how that can happen, rayna.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.570
I mean, I got the girls here.
Somebody's got to be here --

15:05.572 --> 15:07.872
I talked to tandy. She would
love to come stay with them.

15:07.874 --> 15:08.873
It's only 10 dates.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.341
Yeah, well,
I got the beverly, too.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.876
I mean, I can't just --

15:11.878 --> 15:13.878
You're telling me frankie can't
take care of the beverly?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.213
Well --
10 dates.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.547
I don't know, sweetie.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.916
I guess maybe I've been
seeing myself

15:17.918 --> 15:21.686
More as, you know, a dad
and the business owner and...

15:24.257 --> 15:25.857
Even hearing that
come out of my mouth

15:25.859 --> 15:28.092
Sounds a little weird,
so, yeah.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.061
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.531
Won't it be great
to get back up onstage together?

15:33.533 --> 15:34.999
Yeah, it will.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.036

with wheelin' dealin'.

pick up the wine.

we had the other night?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.034
Yeah, me too.

Sorry about that.

Autumn:
I felt bad about ditching layla,

17:51.104 --> 17:53.871
But the minute I heard you guys,
I just had to have you.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.440
Well, we were stunned
to get the call.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.408
I mean, we still
can't believe we're here.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.110
So,
how did you guys meet?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.344
We worked at the bluebird

Oh, yeah, of course.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.348
Two young dreamers teaming up
to conquer the world.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.184
Well, actually,
gunnar was more the dreamer.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.618
I was just writing poetry
back then.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.454
Oh. You're a poet.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
How did you make the switch
into songwriting?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.291
Uh, he surprised me
one day

18:13.293 --> 18:14.892
And put one of my poems
to music.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.294
So<i> you're</i> the musician
of the group.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.062
Oh. [chuckles] I mean,
I wouldn't say that, exactly.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.430
And then
you guys dated, right?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.232
'cause you are the exes,
after all.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.233

You guys live together?

18:30.410 --> 18:31.776
Uh, yeah, we did.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.911
Yeah, we were friends first
and then roommates.

18:33.913 --> 18:34.979
And then you weren't.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.647
So, who broke up with whom?

25:44.410 --> 25:46.810
So, uh, I just called layla
to tell her about the tour,

25:46.812 --> 25:48.379
And apparently,
she's not available.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.547
What?!

25:49.549 --> 25:51.715
Before I could even tell her
what we had planned,

25:51.717 --> 25:53.250
She tells me
she's got herself booked

25:53.252 --> 25:55.085
On luke wheeler's tour.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.321
How'd that happen?
I have no idea.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.924
Was she planning on discussing
this with us, or...?

25:59.926 --> 26:02.426
Well, I don't know,
but it's great news, right?

26:02.428 --> 26:04.395
We needed her on a tour.
Now she's on a tour.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.163
And you don't have to
go out anymore.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.765
I have to admit,
I feel a little gut-punched.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.099
Well, layla didn't know

26:09.101 --> 26:10.334
We were trying
to put something together.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.102
You know,
it's not just layla.

26:12.104 --> 26:16.240
It's...Juliette and sadie
and markus and --

26:16.242 --> 26:18.042
I just feel like
I pour my heart and soul

26:18.044 --> 26:20.744
Into these artists, and...
It's all for nothing.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.613
But now you have the exes
and you have layla,

26:22.615 --> 26:24.114
And things are going well.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.117
Look, ray, I know this hasn't
been an easy ride for you,

26:27.119 --> 26:29.553

to a platinum single,

26:29.555 --> 26:32.256

two stellar albums,

that matters here.

Why would we take
a highway 65 artist

26:53.713 --> 26:55.112

instead of one of our own?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.213
