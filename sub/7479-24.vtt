00:04.070 --> 00:05.471
- I was just thinking.
- About what?

00:05.539 --> 00:06.596
Something Hetty said.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.435
She pulled me aside
and wanted to talk.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.077
Me too. We had a heart-to-heart today
about the future.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.543
- Me three.
- She's putting her affairs in order.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.806
- Where is she?
- Gone.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.245
- Who are you?
- Lauren Hunter, her replacement.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.060
I'm sorry.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.865
Don't!

02:32.653 --> 02:35.554
Where can I find Comescu?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.856
Yes, you are.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.365
Oh, bugger.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.295
- Try to call her?
- Three times.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.897
I got voicemail. Line was busy.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.466
That's probably me leaving a message.
Six times.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.433
- There's gotta be more to this.
- Yeah, and she knows.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.668
- Did you talk to Hetty?
- She's not answering.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.174
- Do you think she was pushed?
- It'd take a brave man to push Hetty.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.939
- Or an ambitious woman.
- What do we know about her, Eric?

03:34.114 --> 03:37.015
You seriously think I'd misuse
the entire resources of the Pentagon,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.481
Homeland Security
and half a dozen classified databases

03:39.653 --> 03:41.780
just to gather information
on Senior Agent Hunter?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.946
- So she is an agent, then?
- I didn't say that.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.493
Okay, I did say that.
But it was a calculated guess.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.494
Is there anything else you'd care
to take a guess at?

03:52.800 --> 03:55.769
I guess that she's been
on a classified assignment.

03:55.936 --> 04:00.805
Maybe to some place like,
I don't know, oh, say, Murmansk.

04:00.974 --> 04:04.466
- And then, maybe, like, Warsaw.
- Keep guessing.

04:04.645 --> 04:08.274
I'd also guess that she's been
off the grid for two years.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.240
Three.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.176
That's also just a guess.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.214
So who told her to take over
for Hetty?

04:16.390 --> 04:19.052
That would have to come
from the top, Director Vance.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.524
But that really is a guess. Not that
everything else I said wasn't a guess.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.124
Where's he going?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.992
I guess he's going to ask her.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.076
Yes, I have the authority.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.304
Fine, you do that
and get back to me.

04:44.384 --> 04:47.012
You walked off last night
when I wanted to talk with you.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.087
So who are you?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.248
I'm Miss Lange's replacement.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.325
- She...
- Did not retire.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.861
Not voluntarily.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.927
You were very close with her.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.803
I can understand your confusion.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.602
Ah. Warsaw.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.719
Okay, you got me.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.930
Hetty's gone, Agent Callen.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.623
She told me herself
she's not coming back.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.961
Well, she hasn't told me,

06:11.138 --> 06:12.799
and since she's not answering
her phone...

06:12.973 --> 06:15.237
Then she mustn't wanna talk
with you.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.502
You don't know Hetty.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.074
On the contrary.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.084
- Serbian?
- Not Serbian.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.387
Agent Callen?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.125
Agent Callen.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.135
A word with you, Agent Hanna.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.479
Oh, crap.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.113
You want to tell me
where we're going exactly?

07:00.287 --> 07:01.686
To see Hetty.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.720
What makes you think I know
where she lives?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.722
Let's start with 1237 Hillcrest Drive
in Encino.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.451
What do you mean, start with?

07:09.229 --> 07:12.995
She has three houses
that I'm aware of.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.690
Eric?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.067
I followed her home
a couple of times.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.064
- A couple of times?
- All right, closer to a dozen.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.938
Keeps moving.
Sleeps in a different house every night.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.472
Well, that's great.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.239
And I get to be there when you tell her
you followed her home.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.847
She's gonna be so pissed
when we knock on her door.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.950
Not as pissed as I am.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.181
Keep going, Sam.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.004
She's got company.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.033
Look like feds.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.540
No car out front, though.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.906
You getting a bad feeling about this?

08:00.080 --> 08:03.777
Yeah, ever since you told me
you followed her home.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.229
How you doing?

08:19.633 --> 08:22.033
I live next door.
Just returning the lawn mower.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.266
What's the old girl up to this time?

08:25.439 --> 08:27.634
Haven't seen her in a few days.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.935
Hey, you guys aren't with the city,
are you?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.543
Mind your own business, pal.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.575
- So you are with the city.
- Police business.

08:35.749 --> 08:39.412
- Now get lost.
- Okay. No problem.

08:39.586 --> 08:42.578
Hey, you guys are cops. You probably
don't mind showing me some ID?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.662
Federal agent! Drop the weapon!

09:17.090 --> 09:19.558
Well, I guess they're not feds, Sam.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.151
Gun!

09:38.378 --> 09:40.005
Hetty?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.836
Not good.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.335
Not good at all.

10:56.512 --> 10:58.673
- Oh, that is bad.
- That is very bad.

10:58.857 --> 11:01.155
Did you do that?

11:01.326 --> 11:03.055
They did.

11:03.962 --> 11:05.725
You took cover behind Hetty's Jag?

11:05.897 --> 11:08.991
- What are you? Insane?
- They were shooting. It was close.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.897
- Think Hetty's fine with that?
- What you want us to do? Get shot?

11:12.070 --> 11:14.061
Well, personally,
I would have risked it.

11:14.239 --> 11:16.764
I know.
Big bad mama bear and her Jaguar.

11:16.975 --> 11:18.033
Ooh.

11:18.209 --> 11:20.040
Just saying.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.280
It's your fault.
You should have plugged that guy.

11:28.853 --> 11:31.253
Know anybody with a body shop?

11:35.093 --> 11:36.890
The inner sanctum.

11:37.062 --> 11:39.030
God, it feels weird, huh?

11:39.197 --> 11:41.131
Feels wrong.

11:41.299 --> 11:44.791
- It's kind of freaking me out, actually.
- Yikes.

11:45.003 --> 11:47.870
Listen, if we have to go
through her stuff,

11:48.039 --> 11:50.530
I am not doing the bedroom.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.235
Hey, what do we know
about those guys?

11:54.412 --> 11:55.811
They weren't carrying IDs.

11:56.014 --> 11:57.038
So freelancers.

11:57.215 --> 11:58.477
Maybe former military.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.949
- Okay. Did Eric talk to Hetty?
- Not yet.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.020
I found something.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.654
Hetty interruptus.

12:09.928 --> 12:11.793
Really wish you hadn't said that.

12:12.397 --> 12:13.659
Me too.

12:19.471 --> 12:23.066
You know what this is all about?
Now would be a good time to tell us.

12:23.241 --> 12:24.799
You're asking the wrong person.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.035
- Oh, then who should I be asking?
- Me.

12:28.246 --> 12:30.237
Ops, now. All of you.

12:38.556 --> 12:41.320
Agent Callen,
tell me what you know.

12:41.493 --> 12:43.518
Well, I know
that Hetty has disappeared.

12:43.695 --> 12:45.492
We just shot three guys
searching her house.

12:45.663 --> 12:47.597
And I'm hoping to hell
you know more than that.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.927
I'm as shocked as you are
that Hetty resigned.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.598
I flew out here to try to talk her
into staying.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.137
I arrived to find
that she had already left.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.767
And her replacement?

12:57.942 --> 12:59.466
That's Hetty's suggestion.

12:59.644 --> 13:02.875
Take my word for it, Agent Hunter
is more than up to the task.

13:04.315 --> 13:05.475
What did she say?

13:06.818 --> 13:07.944
That she was tired.

13:08.119 --> 13:09.347
She'd had enough.

13:09.821 --> 13:12.119
- You don't believe that.
- No.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.485
Neither do you, Agent Callen.

13:14.659 --> 13:17.492
What the hell has she gotten herself
mixed up in?

13:17.662 --> 13:19.323
I don't know.

13:19.631 --> 13:22.794
But whatever it is, I don't think
she believes she can get out of it alive.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.698
Latest please, Eric?

13:30.875 --> 13:32.672
Running fingerprints
and facial recognition,

13:32.844 --> 13:35.142
but still no positive ID
on any of the shooters.

13:37.215 --> 13:38.614
That's all I got.

13:39.017 --> 13:42.043
Did Hetty ask either of you
to do any off-the-book intel gathering?

13:42.220 --> 13:43.915
No, not lately.

13:44.122 --> 13:45.214
No, nothing urgent.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.482
Any pending cases?

13:47.325 --> 13:49.384
Maybe she was out front
on something.

13:49.561 --> 13:52.086
We're not privy
to any pending operations.

13:52.263 --> 13:55.323
We don't have access
until Hetty gives it to us.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.937
Zulu, November, Tango...

14:03.041 --> 14:04.941
one-one-seven-nine.

14:07.579 --> 14:09.103
Check the sign-in log.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.078
Open the file Hetty accessed the most
in the last two weeks.

14:15.854 --> 14:16.878
Open it.

14:30.201 --> 14:32.032
Crap, we got a virus.

14:32.203 --> 14:34.967
Tell me that it didn't just wipe out
our entire database, Eric.

14:36.741 --> 14:39.266
No. We're good.
It was localized to that file.

14:39.444 --> 14:42.242
It's probably a one-time virus

14:42.413 --> 14:44.938
that's activated to erase
the next time you open the file.

14:45.116 --> 14:47.584
And the last name to access
that file?

14:52.790 --> 14:54.189
Hetty.

14:57.061 --> 14:58.790
Eric, what's the code name
to the file?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.457
"Operation Comescu."

15:08.940 --> 15:10.271
What's Comescu?

15:47.812 --> 15:49.245
Yeah.

15:52.050 --> 15:55.315
I have a message for Comescu.

15:57.155 --> 16:01.615
Obviously, an important message
for you to kill two of my men.

16:02.527 --> 16:05.553
I apologize. It was an overreaction.

16:05.763 --> 16:08.527
Oh. Theirs? Or yours?

16:13.004 --> 16:14.062
Who are you?

16:14.505 --> 16:17.133
Who I am doesn't matter.
My message does.

16:18.309 --> 16:22.336
Well, tell me and I will pass it on.

16:23.648 --> 16:27.846
I'm sorry, my message needs
to be delivered in person.

16:29.654 --> 16:32.418
I could shoot you right now.

16:33.691 --> 16:35.158
Go ahead.

16:35.326 --> 16:38.159
But when Comescu finds out
what you've done,

16:38.329 --> 16:40.422
we'll both be dead together.

16:56.179 --> 16:58.477
Director, I got a hit
on our dead guys.

16:58.648 --> 16:59.808
I'll call you back.

16:59.983 --> 17:01.610
Put it up.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.920
All four had military records.

17:05.688 --> 17:07.280
All cashed out.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.117
All different units.
No common vector.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.692
I got it. Guns for hire.

17:11.861 --> 17:14.694
So if I wanted to hire them,
who would I call, Eric?

17:14.864 --> 17:17.492
- Working on it.
- Work faster.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.339
Car was in the garage,
maybe she got a rental.

17:24.507 --> 17:26.737
No, at least not in her name.

17:26.943 --> 17:28.137
Passport?

17:28.310 --> 17:29.335
Nothing.

17:29.512 --> 17:33.846
If Hetty's outside of the country,
she's traveling under an alias.

17:34.217 --> 17:35.844
Comescu operates out of Europe.

17:36.019 --> 17:38.886
If that's the case she's tracking,
that's where she's gone.

17:39.055 --> 17:43.719
Then to track her, I'll need to find out
which alias she's traveling under.

17:45.828 --> 17:47.659
Miss Jones.

17:48.364 --> 17:49.888
For your eyes only.

17:56.873 --> 17:59.433
Access is limited
to Hetty's documented aliases.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.237
No downloading, no printing,
no copying.

18:02.412 --> 18:04.107
You report only to me. Understood?

18:04.847 --> 18:06.041
Got it.

18:06.349 --> 18:08.613
I back up critical files
to my SkyDrive.

18:08.785 --> 18:10.980
Hm. Smart.

18:13.756 --> 18:16.281
ID and password.

18:19.796 --> 18:22.094
You don't have keystroke recognition
software

18:22.265 --> 18:24.199
installed in this computer,
do you, Miss Jones?

18:26.402 --> 18:29.496
- No, sir.
- I'm pleased to hear it.

18:30.006 --> 18:31.234
Done.

18:31.407 --> 18:32.635
Where's Hunter?

18:32.809 --> 18:35.004
Uh, I don't know. Bathroom?

18:54.731 --> 18:56.892
Don't get a lot of fieldwork?

18:59.669 --> 19:02.001
I'm not really known
for my marksmanship.

19:02.171 --> 19:05.163
Well, you're not really known for much
at all.

19:06.909 --> 19:09.776
In fact, no one that works here
has ever heard of you.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.548
Oh, well,

19:16.052 --> 19:17.349
that's all right.

19:18.454 --> 19:21.321
Because I've never really heard
of any of them.

19:21.958 --> 19:23.152
Except you.

19:23.559 --> 19:24.583
And Hetty.

19:24.761 --> 19:26.251
Yeah.

19:30.933 --> 19:32.161
You don't like me.

19:32.602 --> 19:33.796
I don't know you.

19:35.271 --> 19:37.296
Whatever happened
to first impressions?

19:37.707 --> 19:39.766
Usually unreliable,

19:39.942 --> 19:41.204
except maybe in your case.

19:42.145 --> 19:43.612
Who's Comescu?

19:47.984 --> 19:51.681
- That's a question for the director.
- Yeah, well, I'm asking you.

19:56.592 --> 19:58.389
Hetty trusts me.

19:58.594 --> 20:03.497
She would not have recommended me
to take over if she didn't.

20:05.001 --> 20:07.094
Doesn't that count for something?

20:09.839 --> 20:12.637
It should count enough for you
to tell me the truth.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.869
Who is Comescu?

20:21.017 --> 20:23.178
I'm sorry, Callen,

20:26.889 --> 20:29.221
but I can't answer that.

20:50.279 --> 20:52.213
Who's Comescu?

20:53.449 --> 20:56.077
That's classified, Agent Callen.
You haven't been read-in.

20:56.252 --> 20:58.686
- Then read me in.
- I can't do that.

21:00.423 --> 21:01.913
Hetty trashed the file, remember?

21:02.859 --> 21:05.157
You're telling me
that was the only copy?

21:05.795 --> 21:07.353
As far as I know, yes.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.930
Now, it's possible Hetty may have
a backup

21:10.099 --> 21:12.727
but you're gonna have to ask her that
once we track her down.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.262
Agent Hunter's read-in?

21:15.438 --> 21:17.133
- She is.
- Great.

21:17.306 --> 21:18.364
I'll have her brief me.

21:18.541 --> 21:19.974
It's a thin file, Agent Callen.

21:20.309 --> 21:22.436
It's light on facts,
it's heavy on speculation.

21:22.612 --> 21:24.580
Okay, then why exactly
was Agent Hunter read-in?

21:24.747 --> 21:27.739
Because she specializes
in linguistics.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.885
The decision was Hetty's,
Agent Callen.

21:30.286 --> 21:33.084
She's highly regarded,
not just by this agency.

21:33.489 --> 21:35.582
You're gonna have to trust her.

21:35.758 --> 21:37.919
And you're gonna have to learn
to work with her, fast.

21:38.094 --> 21:40.892
Because if we don't find Hetty,
what is now a temporary position

21:41.063 --> 21:42.325
will become permanent.

21:42.498 --> 21:44.830
Director, I've found him.

21:45.201 --> 21:47.829
- It can wait.
- No, it can't, Eric.

21:48.004 --> 21:49.266
You found who?

21:49.438 --> 21:52.236
The pro-team's booking agent.
His name is Bernie Fisher.

21:52.408 --> 21:55.502
Photo and his current GPS location
have just been uploaded.

21:55.945 --> 21:57.970
Sounds like we're done here,
Agent Callen.

21:58.147 --> 21:59.307
Bring him in.

22:15.665 --> 22:18.498
I got a condition.
A medical condition.

22:18.668 --> 22:21.466
Don't worry, it's common.
Lot of people sweat when they lie.

22:22.004 --> 22:25.940
- I'm not lying. Why would I lie?
- Facing 15 to 20, hell, I'd lie, Bernie.

22:26.108 --> 22:28.736
- Would you lie, Sam?
- I'd lie like there's no tomorrow.

22:29.011 --> 22:32.344
Actually, 15 years in military prison,
there is no tomorrow.

22:32.515 --> 22:34.608
What do you mean, military prison?

22:34.884 --> 22:37.114
- Military crime.
- Military investigation.

22:37.286 --> 22:38.446
Military prison.

22:38.821 --> 22:41.119
But I'm not a military guy.
Look at me.

22:41.290 --> 22:43.485
- I hate the military.
- Careful.

22:44.327 --> 22:46.522
I'm a pacifist for God's sake.

22:46.963 --> 22:50.296
Pacifists don't go down very well
in military prison.

22:50.466 --> 22:52.400
Well, actually, they do go down.

22:54.070 --> 22:57.665
Listen, this is not a lie, okay?

22:57.840 --> 22:59.364
I just book them.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.908
I don't know what they do
or how they do it.

23:02.078 --> 23:04.376
They don't tell me, I don't ask.

23:04.547 --> 23:05.741
I'm just a booking agent.

23:05.915 --> 23:08.577
- Mr. Ten Percent, you know?
- Only 10 percent?

23:09.085 --> 23:10.575
Okay, 35.

23:10.786 --> 23:13.687
- There he goes lying again.
- Can I have some water?

23:13.856 --> 23:17.417
You know, in military prison,
they only give water twice a day.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.385
- Did you know that, G?
- I didn't know that, Sam.

23:20.563 --> 23:23.532
I guess we're gonna have to hold off
on the water there, Bernie?

23:26.669 --> 23:28.762
Okay, I want
you to take a look at some photos.

23:28.938 --> 23:31.736
- Ever see anything like it?
- Nope.

23:32.074 --> 23:34.065
Guy's leaking like a sieve.

23:34.243 --> 23:35.540
Sweating out a confession.

23:36.445 --> 23:37.571
Oh, my God.

23:37.747 --> 23:41.183
- Why do they all look dead?
- Because we killed them.

23:42.251 --> 23:44.048
What do you wanna know?
I'll tell you.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.448
What were they looking for?

23:45.621 --> 23:47.919
A file. Probably on a computer
or them thumb drives.

23:48.324 --> 23:50.053
- What file?
- I only got a name,

23:50.226 --> 23:51.784
I got no idea what's on it, okay?

23:51.961 --> 23:54.054
What was the name of the file,
Bernie?

23:54.230 --> 23:55.697
Operation Comescu.

23:59.035 --> 24:00.559
Yeah, we saw that coming.

24:02.638 --> 24:03.935
What were the arrangements?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.434
Fifty grand up front.

24:05.608 --> 24:07.735
I was supposed to call them
when we got the file.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.741
Another 50 on delivery.

24:10.079 --> 24:12.138
- Who called you?
- The guy himself.

24:13.115 --> 24:15.982
- What guy?
- Grigore Comescu.

24:19.455 --> 24:21.320
Only he didn't call.

24:21.490 --> 24:24.084
We met. Over coffee.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.995
And did not see that coming.

24:28.464 --> 24:30.295
Comescu is here in Los Angeles?

24:30.466 --> 24:33.162
Yeah. Honest to God, I am not lying.

24:49.517 --> 24:52.315
Hetty must have found out
Comescu was looking for his file.

24:52.487 --> 24:54.148
Explains why
she planted the virus in it.

24:54.322 --> 24:55.550
Trying to stay one step ahead.

24:55.723 --> 24:57.918
We've got Comescu's number.
He's expecting a call.

24:58.092 --> 25:00.492
- Simple, we offer him what he wants.
- The file.

25:00.661 --> 25:03.391
I'll pose as a member of the pro-team.
We're cutting Bernie out.

25:03.931 --> 25:05.330
He makes the meet, we grab him.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.025
- Any chance Bernie Fisher is lying?
- No.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.692
- Nope.
- Nah.

25:09.871 --> 25:11.771
Well, glad to see
you all share the same view.

25:11.939 --> 25:13.804
Don't mess it up.

25:20.581 --> 25:22.276
The only intel we have
on Grigore Comescu

25:22.450 --> 25:24.782
are some blurry surveillance photos
from Interpol.

25:24.952 --> 25:27.045
La Police Nationale file from Paris

25:27.221 --> 25:29.018
linking him to people-smuggling
in Poland.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.851
Hetty must have known more.

25:31.025 --> 25:34.188
- Why would she be tracking this?
- I'm acutely aware of that fact, Callen.

25:34.362 --> 25:36.592
So brief me on Operation Comescu.

25:37.532 --> 25:42.094
Agent Hunter, does Agent Callen
have the information to proceed?

25:42.270 --> 25:43.294
Yes, director.

25:43.471 --> 25:46.599
Then that's all the information
you need to know, Agent Callen.

25:53.614 --> 25:55.844
And, Agent Callen...

25:56.484 --> 25:59.544
I'll be the one interviewing Comescu
when you bring him in.

26:09.063 --> 26:11.429
Any chance that Hetty's analysis
is wrong?

26:12.233 --> 26:15.225
No. Hetty didn't get it wrong.

26:27.882 --> 26:29.349
In position, Sam.

26:29.517 --> 26:31.451
Deeks, heads up.
He's out there somewhere.

26:31.619 --> 26:33.484
Roger that, Sam.

26:35.456 --> 26:37.947
- Eric, picture up?
- Picture's up, Sam.

26:39.994 --> 26:43.930
Hey, um, some guy,
he gave me 10 bucks to give you this.

26:44.098 --> 26:45.656
What guy?

26:49.971 --> 26:51.836
Something's up. Hold your positions.

26:56.143 --> 26:58.202
Meeting's changed, Sam.

26:58.512 --> 27:01.037
Rooftop across the street.

27:01.916 --> 27:05.044
G, this is not a good idea.
We don't have rooftop cover.

27:07.822 --> 27:09.221
G, are you reading me?

27:10.491 --> 27:12.459
Why is he moving
from the street to the rooftop?

27:12.627 --> 27:13.787
Secluded.

27:13.961 --> 27:15.986
No one else.
He wants to make sure he's alone.

27:16.163 --> 27:19.189
But that cuts both ways.
Leaves Comescu exposed as well.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.435
He'll have backup.
At least one guy with him.

27:23.838 --> 27:24.998
Plus high cover.

27:27.174 --> 27:29.836
The high-rise behind you
overlooks the rooftop.

27:30.011 --> 27:32.502
That's where I'd be.
Kensi, Deeks, check it.

28:11.185 --> 28:12.345
I like rooftops.

28:13.254 --> 28:14.881
You can be alone.

28:15.056 --> 28:16.887
You can enjoy the view.

28:17.058 --> 28:18.582
You can smoke.

28:25.032 --> 28:26.499
You can throw people off.

28:26.867 --> 28:28.300
Heh.

28:29.003 --> 28:32.439
- You like rooftops?
- Not particularly.

28:33.007 --> 28:35.271
- You got my money?
- You have my file?

28:41.782 --> 28:43.647
Eric, you're gonna have
to be my eyes.

28:43.818 --> 28:45.308
First sign of trouble,
you understand?

28:45.720 --> 28:46.812
You got it, Sam.

28:47.021 --> 28:48.420
There.

28:59.734 --> 29:01.827
They tell us there might be a woman
in the house.

29:02.036 --> 29:03.435
She wasn't there.

29:03.604 --> 29:05.765
You were fortunate.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.238
I know others who were not.

29:08.743 --> 29:10.472
The file.

29:10.644 --> 29:14.307
This woman,
you say she's causing you problems?

29:16.183 --> 29:18.413
Not for much longer.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.185
You wanna tell us where she is,

29:25.359 --> 29:26.792
we can take care of her for you.

29:28.162 --> 29:30.562
Not necessary, we have her.

29:47.782 --> 29:49.306
Federal agents!

29:52.787 --> 29:54.618
Sam, the second shooter. Go.

30:13.641 --> 30:15.370
Kensi, Deeks, what's your status?

30:17.411 --> 30:19.811
We're good. One down.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.875
Eric, tell Director Vance.

30:26.053 --> 30:27.247
Comescu's dead.

30:27.922 --> 30:31.380
He, um, knows.

30:46.774 --> 30:47.832
I found Hetty.

30:48.275 --> 30:51.210
Well, not exactly,
but we're on her trail.

30:51.378 --> 30:52.538
She bought a ticket to Prague

30:52.713 --> 30:55.079
under one of her aliases,
Gloria Edwards.

30:55.249 --> 30:57.183
She then used a credit card
under the same name

30:57.351 --> 30:59.012
and booked into a hotel yesterday.

30:59.186 --> 31:01.381
And last night, she used the card
to pay for a cab

31:01.555 --> 31:03.352
to an address in the west of the city.

31:03.524 --> 31:05.287
She's not wasting any time.

31:05.459 --> 31:07.359
She's not bothering
to cover her tracks.

31:07.528 --> 31:09.689
It's like she doesn't think
it matters anymore.

31:09.864 --> 31:11.798
Was it a one-way
or round trip ticket?

31:12.266 --> 31:13.358
One-way.

31:14.301 --> 31:16.735
- Comescu's people have Hetty.
- Yeah, I heard.

31:16.904 --> 31:18.565
We'll find her.
I'm putting a team on it.

31:18.739 --> 31:21.173
- You have a team.
- Not in Prague I don't.

31:23.944 --> 31:25.707
How long have you known
she's in Prague?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.313
Miss Jones just told me.

31:30.451 --> 31:33.648
- I need a ticket on the next flight.
- Not necessary.

31:33.821 --> 31:35.461
I'll send a team from
the office in Paris.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.784
Great. They can pick me up
when I land in Prague.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.038
You're not going to Prague.

31:39.326 --> 31:42.818
I speak Czech. I speak Romanian.
I have contacts, they can help us.

31:42.997 --> 31:45.261
You are no longer on this case,
Agent Callen.

31:45.432 --> 31:46.990
Then give me a reason.
Tell me why?

31:47.201 --> 31:49.431
What is Operation Comescu about?

31:50.104 --> 31:53.198
It's about you, Agent Callen.

31:54.616 --> 31:58.108
Operation Comescu is all about you.

32:11.557 --> 32:14.185
Operation Comescu
is an ongoing investigation

32:14.360 --> 32:16.328
into a Romanian crime family.

32:16.629 --> 32:19.723
Dream up the worst pain and suffering
a man can inflict on another man,

32:20.032 --> 32:22.057
Comescu family has done worse.

32:22.234 --> 32:23.531
They've done much worse.

32:25.905 --> 32:28.567
I don't have to ask if you remember
Dobrashin Garasovic, do I?

32:31.944 --> 32:33.411
Garasovic was Romany.

32:33.779 --> 32:35.747
Just like the Comescus.

32:35.915 --> 32:38.383
He was trying to contact you.
He was trying to warn you.

32:39.051 --> 32:41.747
- Warn me about what?
- That's what Hetty's trying to find out.

32:42.555 --> 32:44.523
That's what she was working on.

32:44.690 --> 32:47.591
Operation Comescu
is hers and hers alone.

32:50.529 --> 32:51.757
She found out...

32:51.931 --> 32:54.195
The Comescu family wants you dead,
Agent Callen.

32:56.035 --> 32:57.229
Why?

32:57.403 --> 33:00.236
Some sort of long-running family feud
as far as we can tell.

33:00.406 --> 33:02.670
I don't have any family.

33:07.813 --> 33:09.041
They think I do?

33:11.684 --> 33:13.481
They probably mistake you
for somebody else.

33:15.788 --> 33:17.585
Probably.

33:21.761 --> 33:23.490
Hetty was trying to protect me.

33:23.929 --> 33:25.328
That's why you can't go to Prague.

33:25.498 --> 33:28.433
That is why I have to go to Prague.

33:28.601 --> 33:30.728
Hetty has resigned her position.

33:31.404 --> 33:34.567
She's operating outside of the authority
of this agency.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.571
We will send a team from Paris.

33:36.742 --> 33:38.607
We'll find her.
We'll try to bring her back.

33:38.778 --> 33:40.618
We'll get her out of there.
And you will not...

33:40.780 --> 33:44.079
You will not be a part of that team.

34:34.266 --> 34:35.630
I would if I could.

34:36.869 --> 34:39.303
Yes, you would, detective.

34:47.279 --> 34:49.076
Prague's a big city.

34:49.281 --> 34:51.043
They won't even know
where to start looking.

34:52.518 --> 34:56.579
I, uh, automatically uploaded
all of the Prague addresses

34:56.789 --> 34:58.381
and information into the system.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.752
It's already on their cell phones.

35:00.926 --> 35:02.416
I'm sorry.

35:02.595 --> 35:04.825
Find her, Agent Hunter.

35:05.297 --> 35:07.492
Before they all get killed.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.849
You gonna keep doing that?

35:26.952 --> 35:28.886
I hate buying guns
on the black market.

35:30.322 --> 35:31.550
Don't know where they've been.

35:31.724 --> 35:34.124
Don't know when they
were last cleaned or by whom.

35:34.326 --> 35:38.092
- You cleaned it this morning.
- Twice.

35:38.264 --> 35:40.255
This cheap ammo's gonna jam.

35:40.866 --> 35:42.390
You didn't have to come, you know?

35:42.568 --> 35:44.058
Yet here we are.

35:50.576 --> 35:52.567
Okay, let's do this.

35:52.945 --> 35:56.574
This time, leave at least
one of them alive, will you?

35:56.749 --> 35:59.377
Then don't make me have
to save your sorry ass again.

37:01.547 --> 37:03.037
Clear!

37:03.215 --> 37:04.705
Clear!

37:06.518 --> 37:08.008
Here.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.709
Hetty's alive.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.814
- Where?
- Romania.

38:03.976 --> 38:06.103
My apologies...

38:06.278 --> 38:08.007
for intruding.

38:10.215 --> 38:15.118
I have a message
for the head of the Comescu family.

38:27.299 --> 38:30.791
I am the head
of the Comescu family.

38:31.937 --> 38:34.770
My name is Alexa Comescu.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.935
- And I'm...
- Gloria Edwards,

38:37.109 --> 38:39.236
according to your passport.

38:39.645 --> 38:41.579
You real name is Henrietta Lange.

38:41.747 --> 38:43.806
You prefer Hetty.

38:45.517 --> 38:47.712
But I doubt even that
is your real name.

38:49.555 --> 38:52.422
Now, tell me, Henrietta,

38:53.926 --> 38:56.759
what message
could be of such importance

38:56.929 --> 39:00.729
that you are willing to die
to deliver it?

39:22.855 --> 39:25.483
Two stories. High fence.

39:29.461 --> 39:32.794
Well, the gate will be guarded,
even if you can't see them.

39:34.266 --> 39:36.598
Approach from the beach
will probably be covered as well.

39:36.769 --> 39:38.532
They'd see us coming miles away.

39:38.704 --> 39:40.672
Well, then it has to be from the road.

39:40.839 --> 39:44.275
Main entrance, we drive up,
talk our way in.

39:44.777 --> 39:46.301
Maybe a diversion from the beach.

39:46.478 --> 39:48.275
Something to get them looking out.

39:48.447 --> 39:51.814
Then we can come in tactical
from the road. Hit them hard and fast.

39:51.984 --> 39:55.283
For many years now,
you have been looking for a man.

39:56.121 --> 39:58.954
The last of his family.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.153
- His name...
- I know his name.

40:55.013 --> 40:56.742
And what is this?

40:57.749 --> 40:59.512
Proof.

41:00.052 --> 41:02.020
Working late, Miss Jones?

41:02.187 --> 41:05.281
Oh, uh, yeah, I was just...

41:05.457 --> 41:07.391
"Lange, Henrietta."

41:07.559 --> 41:10.084
Well, I found something odd.

41:10.796 --> 41:13.594
Two things, actually.

41:13.799 --> 41:16.927
A week before Hetty left,
she put in a document request

41:17.236 --> 41:20.763
and after it arrived,
she erased the paper trail.

41:21.073 --> 41:23.098
Well, obviously,
she didn't erase all of it.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.367
What was the document?

41:25.811 --> 41:28.541
Callen's death certificate.

41:32.217 --> 41:34.981
He died three weeks ago.

41:37.756 --> 41:41.590
They are all dead, Alexa.

41:42.694 --> 41:43.956
What was the second thing?

41:44.496 --> 41:46.930
Well, I saw this.

41:47.099 --> 41:50.728
Uh, I know I wasn't supposed to,

41:50.903 --> 41:52.962
but it's Hetty's personnel file.

41:53.138 --> 41:55.606
"Additional distinguishing features."

41:55.774 --> 41:57.071
I know. It says she has a...

41:58.644 --> 42:00.805
You tell no one.

42:00.979 --> 42:03.243
Do you understand, Miss Jones?

42:04.516 --> 42:06.416
Understood.

42:44.456 --> 42:45.980
G.

42:51.997 --> 42:53.521
G.

42:54.266 --> 42:55.790
G?

42:57.135 --> 42:59.467
And why should I trust you?
