WEBVTT

00:05.240 --> 00:07.515
-Charlie?
-Yeah?

00:07.680 --> 00:09.716
We said
we were gonna take things slow.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.077
We did say that.
l guess we can't be trusted.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.233
-Charlie, talk to me.
-All right.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.392
You know what l'm gonna do to you,
you dirty, filthy girl?

00:21.080 --> 00:25.392
-No, not like that.
-Wrong way? Am l a dirty, filthy boy?

00:25.880 --> 00:28.030
No, l wanna talk about us.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.555
We're a dirty, filthy couple.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.869
No,
l wanna talk about our relationship.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.593
Well, that redirects the old blood flow.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.991
Okay, so what about it?

00:43.160 --> 00:47.233
-You know that l really care about you.
-And l care about you too.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.594
All right, good talk.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.955
l just wanna make sure
that if we do this. . .

00:51.120 --> 00:53.076
. . .we're doing it for the right reasons.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.199
Well, not to be contrary, but the wrong
reasons kick everything up a notch.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.194
l just wanna make sure. . .

00:59.360 --> 01:01.430
. . .we give our relationship
a chance to grow.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.751
-So you want to stop?
-No, l really want you.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.592
Mia, all this starting and stopping
is really not good for my transmission.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.513
l'm sorry. l'm just so confused. l--

01:15.680 --> 01:18.717
That's why you're gonna have to
make this decision for both of us.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.440
Me? l have to make this decision?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.592
That's like asking the fat kid
to guard the pie.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.468
l trust you, Charlie.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.792
Well, that is really low.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.516
-Okay, we'll wait.
-Thank you.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.672
-So, what do we do now?
-We could take a walk on the beach.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.114
No, seriously.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.791
Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.675
l've always been meaning to do that.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.314
Good morning, everyone.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.914
-Good morning.
-Looks to be a beautiful day.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.074
Overcast, but that should burn off
in a few hours. . .

02:01.240 --> 02:03.913
. . .leaving us
with a sun-dappled afternoon in paradise.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.709
You still drunk from last night
or did you get a fresh buzz this morning?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.550
No, ma'am,
l am quite simply high on life.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.238
Blotto.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.116
l am not drunk.
Alan, guess what l did last night.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.636
-Jake.
-l'm leaving.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.392
No, Jake can hear this.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.551
-Last night--
-Wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.712
You're about to tell us something
that made you happy?

02:27.880 --> 02:28.949
-Yes.
-Jake.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.109
l'm leaving.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.431
Jake, stay. l want to share this
with my entire family.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.669
Okay, l'm leaving.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.910
Berta,
l consider you part of my family.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.272
-Am l in your will?
-No, but neither are the rest of them.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.999
Now listen.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.675
Last night, l, Charlie Harper,
delayed gratification.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.113
What did you do,
wait till she fell asleep?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.876
-Wait for what?
-Jake.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.678
-l'm leaving.
-Sit down.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.553
What happened last night is l may
have started a meaningful relationship.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.872
Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off.
You're embarrassing yourself.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.038
Come on, listen to me.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.998
-l think l might be in love with Mia.
-Big deal.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.390
You've always been in love
with you-a.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.995
-Very funny.
-l thought so. Did you think so?

03:19.160 --> 03:20.798
-That was pretty good.
-Yeah.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.077
He's 1 1 . He still thinks
''Milk Milk Lemonade'' is funny.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.992
Oh, yeah.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.796
Hello? Grandmommy's here.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.235
Oh, great.
Tell Mom what you told us, Charlie.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.389
No.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.391
-Tell me what?
-Nothing.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.357
-Do you need a good lawyer?
-No.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.999
-Discreet doctor?
-No.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.071
-Knock-off Gucci handbag?
-What?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.549
There's only so many ways
l can help you, dear.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.793
lt's no big deal. l've just been seeing
this ballet dancer. She might be the one.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.393
Drunk?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.549
He says, ''No. ''

03:53.720 --> 03:56.029
l think it might be
one of those designer drugs.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.670
Charlie, what did you take?

04:01.320 --> 04:04.153
l'm serious. We've been
seeing each other for over a month.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.915
We're waiting to sleep together until
our relationship has a solid foundation.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.789
Well, we can rule out ecstasy.
l mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.834
l've heard.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.074
Nowadays you're supposed to say
''African American-disiac. ''

04:22.280 --> 04:23.759
-Jake.
-You sure this time?

04:23.920 --> 04:26.480
-Yeah.
-l'm leaving.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.438
Has it occurred to you
that maybe l've finally matured?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.909
Maybe l'm ready to build something
with a woman. . .

04:32.080 --> 04:33.832
. . .that isn't solely based on sex?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.433
-Has that occurred to you?
-No.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.953
Berta?

04:37.120 --> 04:38.394
So it's not just me.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.915
You know,
l can understand your skepticism.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.117
l've earned it.
But this girl is different.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.396
And l'm gonna make it work.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.036
l give him another week before he's out
on the beach, humping wet sand.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:45.080 --> 05:46.593
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.159
How was your date?

05:53.680 --> 05:55.079
Fun.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.792
We went bowling.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.839
Still playing it slow?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.992
Ketchup slow.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.670
Glacier slow.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.838
Continental drift slow.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.316
-So slow?
-l'm saying.

06:15.880 --> 06:16.949
Hey, listen.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.432
About this living without sex thing. l was
hoping you can give me a little advice.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.797
Me?
What would make you think of me?

06:25.600 --> 06:29.275
Well, l figure you get laid less often
than a boil-covered dwarf, am l right?

06:30.400 --> 06:33.437
l don't have the actual statistics,
but go on.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.273
Well, you must get really frustrated.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.075
l mean, how do you stop yourself from,
you know. . .

06:39.240 --> 06:42.471
. . .running a red light and then
taunting the cop till he shoots you?

06:42.640 --> 06:43.914
Good question.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.356
l've found that the best thing to do
is to focus on your career. . .

06:47.720 --> 06:50.871
. . .get a hobby, become involved
in community activities. . .

06:51.040 --> 06:53.793
. . .and at the end of the day,
if you have any energy left. . .

06:53.960 --> 06:55.075
. . .find a quiet space. . .

06:55.240 --> 06:57.549
. . .and yank it like a monkey
in a mango tree.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.712
lnteresting.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.791
What kind of hobbies
are we talking about?

07:04.520 --> 07:08.149
Well, l tried collecting stamps,
building model trains. . .

07:08.320 --> 07:11.835
. . .but in the end,
all roads led back up the mango tree.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.309
That's what l was afraid of.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.674
Hey, where are you going?

07:20.360 --> 07:22.749
l'm gonna go get in my car. . .

07:23.040 --> 07:26.316
. . .run a red light
and hope for a clean headshot.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.957
The great thing about this piece
is that it fuses a classical score. . .

07:35.120 --> 07:37.429
. . .with jazz choreography.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.357
On a counter programming note,
the Lakers are playing Miami tonight.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.990
-Would you rather watch that?
-No, no, this is fine.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.118
Of course, l don't have a $500 bet
down on the ballet.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.558
-What channel?
-No, seriously, this is-- Channel 2.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.031
Charlie, you don't have to give up
things that you like just because of me.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.877
Oh, okay, great. Good to know.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.830
Hey,
as long as we're on that subject. . .

08:22.400 --> 08:24.311
. . .there's something
l wanna run past you.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.789
-Go ahead.
-Let me just preface it by saying. . .

08:26.960 --> 08:28.678
. . .that l am for holding off
on sex. . .

08:28.840 --> 08:32.913
. . .so our relationship can develop more,
you know, deepness.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.717
l'm glad. l think it's working too.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.350
We were getting closer than we would,
had we just jumped into bed together.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.080
Good.
Sounds like we're on the same page.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.715
And just to make sure
we don't jump the gun. . .

08:43.880 --> 08:45.757
. . .l was thinking it'd be a good idea. . .

08:45.920 --> 08:50.516
. . .if l had an outlet that,
you know, took the pressure off.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.309
-An outlet?
-Yeah, an outlet.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.550
Something casual, meaningless.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.518
lf l work it right,
it could even be anonymous.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.870
-You mean another woman?
-Well, that would be my first choice.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.789
But for the purposes of this discussion,
let's stay with the term, ''Outlet. ''

09:10.960 --> 09:12.359
l don't care what you call it.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.353
You're asking for permission
to have sex with another woman.

09:15.520 --> 09:19.638
Only because l care about you too much
to whore around without permission.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.756
Are you crazy?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.309
l can't go back to the mango tree,
Mia.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.109
What?

09:26.280 --> 09:30.671
Look, l think this is a mature,
thoughtful suggestion.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.833
ln fact, there are many cultures
that embrace the whole outlet concept. . .

09:35.000 --> 09:37.195
. . .as a way of strengthening
and nurturing. . .

09:37.360 --> 09:39.476
. . .the primary love relationship.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.079
-You can't dismiss entire cultures with:
-l'm going home.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.080
Oh, come on, we're just talking here.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.791
l propose an idea, then we compromise.
That's the cornerstone of a relationship.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.279
How are we gonna compromise?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.635
Are you gonna have sex
with half a woman?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.631
ls that an option?

10:04.400 --> 10:06.152
What's going on?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.715
-We had our first fight.
-Oh, what about?

10:08.880 --> 10:11.348
l suggested
that as long as we weren't having sex. . .

10:11.520 --> 10:15.115
. . .it'd be good for our relationship
if l had sex with somebody else.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.716
And she didn't buy that?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.711
Wouldn't even discuss it.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.593
Women, huh?

10:25.040 --> 10:28.430
They say they wanna talk,
but they don't wanna talk.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.717
What's the matter with Uncle Charlie?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.394
He's down because he had a fight
with his girlfriend.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.349
-That's too bad.
-Hey, why don't you go talk to him.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.272
-Maybe you can cheer him up.
-How?

10:42.440 --> 10:44.112
l don't know. Tell him a joke.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.999
Okay.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.754
Might as well just give him
a bowl of Milky Ways.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.151
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
what's green, has four legs. . .

10:54.320 --> 10:57.869
. . .and would kill you
if it fell out of a tree and landed on you?

10:58.520 --> 11:00.476
-What?
-A pool table.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.356
lt's funny because
you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.113
Nothing.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.678
Okay, l'll talk to him.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.912
Hey, if you can work up a fart,
ask him to pull your finger.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.749
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.951
-Still haven't heard from Mia?
-She won't return my calls.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.798
You do realize that suggesting
to have sex with other women. . .

11:35.960 --> 11:38.394
. . .was a monumentally stupid thing
to do.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.756
Yes, Alan, l realize it.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.872
The question now,
is how do l apologize?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.031
You mean grovel.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.671
No, l mean apologize
with my dignity and pride intact.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.433
Oh, you sad, naive fool.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.472
lf marriage taught me anything. . .

12:02.640 --> 12:05.438
. . .it's that there is no apologizing
without groveling.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.197
-Mia and l aren't married.
-Are you having sex?

12:10.120 --> 12:11.633
Continue.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.472
First of all, the phone's no good.

12:13.640 --> 12:17.315
You must grovel in person.
Humiliation is a visual medium.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.596
-Okay.
-Next, don't go empty-handed.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.753
But keep in mind that any gifts you offer
may end up being thrown at your head.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.230
Flowers, lingerie, jewelry, all good.

12:27.400 --> 12:31.109
Picture frames, waffle irons,
steak knives, not so much.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.911
You actually bought your wife
a waffle iron?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.433
l was young.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.637
She liked waffles.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.110
Anyway,
the most important thing is sincerity.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.713
-Sincerity?
-Yes.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.713
You absolutely must be able
to fake sincerity.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.711
You know what?
l've underestimated you.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.917
You are far more deceitful
than l've given you credit for.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.311
-Thank you.
-No, l was faking sincerity.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.550
Oh, it's very good.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.349
But all kidding aside,
l really appreciate your help.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.193
-Well, you're welcome.
-Got you again.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.918
That's-- That was good.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.469
-Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?
-What's that?

13:07.640 --> 13:09.312
Pull my finger.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.596
-You're bluffing.
-Try me?

13:15.200 --> 13:17.395
Wait, give me another chance.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.073
l though l had one.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.715
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.633
-These are for you.
-You didn't have to do that.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.189
Really? My brother said l did.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.799
Well, thank him for me.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.879
Come on in.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.156
l just want you to know
how sorry l am.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.709
Actually, l think l owe you an apology.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.633
-You do?
-Yeah, these are for you.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.109
You didn't have to do that.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.871
l shouldn't have gotten so angry
with you.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.794
Not to say that your ''outlet'' idea wasn't
incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic--

14:00.400 --> 14:01.879
l accept your apology.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.154
The point is,
is that l really don't have any right. . .

14:06.320 --> 14:08.390
. . .to object to you
sleeping with other women.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.074
We don't have a commitment.
You're free to do whatever.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.956
Thanks. That's great. Very mature.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.236
-So everything's okay now?
-No, you ass.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.348
lf we keep seeing each other,
l want a commitment.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.238
-Commitment?
-Yes, a commitment.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.833
Does that mean we can have sex?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.878
ls that the only reason
you'd be willing to make a commitment?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.156
lt's in the top two.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.311
Well, l think sex should wait
until we get our relationship on track.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.834
Okay, okay.
Let me make sure l understand this.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.356
You want me to make a commitment
that l will not have sex with anyone. . .

14:42.520 --> 14:44.750
. . .at the same time
l'm not having sex with you?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.353
Yes.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.234
All right,
let's come at this from another angle.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.436
We're gonna be sexually exclusive,
but without the sex?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.875
Well,
l suppose you could look at it that way.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.596
So bottom line. . .

15:09.960 --> 15:12.633
. . .no sex for Charlie. . .

15:14.320 --> 15:16.788
. . .with you or anyone else
for the foreseeable future.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.712
Correct.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.478
Are you insane?

15:22.840 --> 15:25.877
lf you care about us, it should be
something that you wanna do.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.712
What are you giving up?

15:27.880 --> 15:30.155
-The same thing.
-You wanna sleep with other guys?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.754
-Of course not.
-Then you're giving up nothing.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.794
Tell you what, l'll give up sex.
You give up, l don't know, a kidney.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.398
Come on, don't be stupid.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.950
-Okay, okay, dancing.
-Dancing's my life, Charlie.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.476
Now we have a level playing field.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.396
You know what,
maybe you should just go.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.836
Right, why stay here when l can
just as easily not have sex with you. . .

15:54.000 --> 15:55.433
. . .in the comfort of my home?

15:55.600 --> 15:56.794
Oh, go to hell.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.791
See?
That's why you didn't get a waffle iron.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.593
Hey, how did it go with Mia?

16:12.760 --> 16:15.399
-Great. We broke up.
-How is that great?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.516
Now l can go back
to being who l really am.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.149
And who's that?

16:19.320 --> 16:21.709
Somebody who doesn't care
who he really is.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.434
Someone who just has fun.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.394
l see. Someone who spends his life
in a drunken haze. . .

16:26.560 --> 16:28.676
. . .having meaningless sex
with strangers.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.149
lf you knew who l am,
why'd you ask?

16:32.440 --> 16:35.830
Hurry, Charlie.
l'm starting to sober up.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.392
Well, we can't have that.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.869
No. You might find out who she is.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.070
-Here you go.
-Good.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.109
Boy, l haven't been this drunk
since l took my SATs.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.392
Doesn't seem to have held you back.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.189
No, just one year. Sixth grade.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.915
Charlie? You okay?

17:06.079 --> 17:08.719
Yeah, l just got a lot on my mind.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.868
Do you wanna look at my boobs?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.155
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.628
lt always cheers me up.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.396
Oh, Mia. Hi.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.311
ls Charlie here?

17:27.480 --> 17:30.313
-Tickle, tickle.
-Cut it out.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.272
That was great, do it again.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.552
Alan,
don't you think it's time. . .

17:43.720 --> 17:45.551
. . .you kept your girlfriend company?

17:45.720 --> 17:48.598
-My what?
-Thanks for playing along.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.437
Oh, yes, my-- My girlfriend.
Yes, excuse me. Coming, pookie.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.514
-Well, this is an awkward moment.
-You are such a schmuck.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.356
Okay, the ice is broken.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.953
-Goodbye, Charlie.
-Oh, come on.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.918
We don't have a commitment.
We don't have a relationship.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.150
You know, you're right.
Go back to your bimbo.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.356
Hey, hey, hey. She's not a bimbo.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.069
l'm not saying she's a brain surgeon.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.800
No, wait, Mia.
At least tell me why you came.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.279
You wanna know why?
l came because after l cooled down. . .

18:27.440 --> 18:29.954
. . .l started to miss you
and l wanted to make love.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.113
-That's great. lt's wonderful.
-And it's not gonna happen.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.232
Why? Because of that bimbo?

18:36.120 --> 18:37.997
Let me tell you something.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.314
The entire time l was fooling around
with her, l was thinking of you.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.391
Oh, swell.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.913
You know what l mean.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.799
l would trade a hundred of her
for one of you.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.998
You're ready to make a commitment?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.639
Yes.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.190
Maybe you want some time
to think about it?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.351
How could that help?

18:57.520 --> 19:00.114
Look, l don't wanna be
with anybody but you. . .

19:00.280 --> 19:02.271
. . .so l might as well be committed.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.559
Yes, you should.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.916
-You wanna go upstairs?
-Not right now.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.992
Oh, please don't tell me
you've got somebody in your room.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.754
No, no, no.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.399
No.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.276
lf we're gonna
do this commitment thing. . .

19:22.440 --> 19:25.398
. . .the first time
should be really special.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.914
What have you got in mind?

19:27.080 --> 19:29.036
Well, you know. Candles, music. . .

19:29.200 --> 19:32.158
. . .and maybe not having the girl
l was trying to rebound with. . .

19:32.320 --> 19:34.993
. . .dancing half naked on the deck
with my idiot brother.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.040
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah. He's an idiot.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.436
Call me later.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.310
Well, back to the mango tree.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.034
What is this?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.350
A healthy cereal
that won't rot your teeth.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.795
You got that right,
because l'm not eating it.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.874
That's all you're getting.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.668
-Morning.
-Morning.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.876
-Morning.
-ls he in a better mood today?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.433
Yeah.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.717
Uncle Charlie,
l got another joke for you.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.238
-Okay.
-There's two muffins. . .

20:23.400 --> 20:25.914
. . .sitting side by side
in a muffin tin in the oven.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.389
One muffin says,
''Boy, it's hot in here. ''

20:28.560 --> 20:31.836
And the other one says,
''Holy crap, a talking muffin. ''

20:35.280 --> 20:38.750
l just don't think
he knows what's funny.
