01:23.582 --> 01:24.716
Come on, Tony.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.617
You just have
to accept the fact

01:26.652 --> 01:28.520
that Latka has
multiple personalities.

01:28.554 --> 01:30.088
Vic Ferrari is one
of them.

01:30.122 --> 01:31.289
But it's not fair.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.058
I mean, Latka
            works here all year,

01:33.092 --> 01:34.559
and then Vic
             takes his vacation.

01:34.593 --> 01:36.227
Well, look at it this way, Tony.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.563
If Latka takes a vacation,
     it's a dull vacation,

01:38.597 --> 01:39.897
but if Vic takes it...

01:39.932 --> 01:42.534
(laughs)

01:42.568 --> 01:44.569
Deal 'em.

01:54.613 --> 01:56.148
(as Vic):
           Hey, guys.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.282
Hey.
Hi.
              Hey.

01:57.316 --> 02:01.819
Hey, I know you're gonna
    break some hearts today.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.822
Hey, uh...
                   hey, Vic, uh,

02:03.856 --> 02:05.624
you all set on
                  your vacation?

02:05.658 --> 02:09.193
Well, I found an outrageous
      condo in Sugarloaf.

02:09.228 --> 02:12.830
Four bedrooms, fireplace.

02:12.899 --> 02:13.665
A hot tub?

02:13.699 --> 02:14.832
Well, it will be

02:14.866 --> 02:16.367
when I get into it.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.403
(laughs)

02:18.437 --> 02:19.971
I'm sorry.

02:20.039 --> 02:23.174
I couldn't
resist.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.311
(high-pitched sigh)

02:26.345 --> 02:28.679
I couldn't resist.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.248
Hey, uh, Vic, do you know,
   this sounds pretty expensive.

02:30.282 --> 02:31.482
Where are you gonna
                  get the money?

02:31.551 --> 02:33.985
Well, I'm not gonna pay
       for it all myself.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.620
I'm gonna have roomies.

02:35.654 --> 02:37.855
I have to find four guys
          by Tuesday.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.157
You know, it's very hard

02:39.191 --> 02:40.992
to find the right kind
           of people.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.761
Why, are-are you looking
        for good skiers?

02:43.796 --> 02:46.397
Oh, Elaine, you're so naive.

02:46.432 --> 02:47.866
Give me a hug.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.434
Uh, no, thank you.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.204
Anyway, let-let me
    tell you the plan.

02:53.238 --> 02:54.372
It's always good

02:54.407 --> 02:56.708
to have one guy
    who likes to cook.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.777
I mean, uh, that way,
      you get your meals,

02:58.811 --> 03:00.411
and you also get a reputation

03:00.446 --> 03:02.414
for breaking down
  the male/female stereotypes.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.415
Also, it's good to have a guy

03:04.450 --> 03:07.018
who looks good in a turtleneck
     and plays the guitar.

03:07.052 --> 03:08.787
Namely, <i>moi.</i>

03:10.890 --> 03:13.024
Then it's always good
     to have a loser along.

03:13.058 --> 03:14.725
That way,
   when you bring him along,

03:14.760 --> 03:16.261
everyone thinks
       you're sensitive.

03:16.295 --> 03:18.062
Then you always...

03:18.130 --> 03:20.898
Of course, you need
 some Austrian guy named Nicky.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.968
Don't ask me why,
     but somehow it works.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.204
(humming)

03:27.273 --> 03:28.906
You know...

03:28.941 --> 03:30.275
(clears throat)

03:30.309 --> 03:35.380
...that Vic
                may have charm,

03:35.414 --> 03:37.482
he may
                have looks,

03:37.516 --> 03:39.317
and he may have charisma,

03:39.351 --> 03:42.186
but there's one thing
       he'll never have.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.722
This.

03:52.030 --> 03:55.900
Charisma does not have jelly
         in the middle.

03:59.938 --> 04:01.239
Play.

04:01.273 --> 04:03.207
(Louie whistling)

04:08.814 --> 04:11.950
Well, why are you
in such a good mood?

04:11.984 --> 04:14.418
Well, if you really
          want to hear about it.

04:14.452 --> 04:17.255
I had a big
                   fight with my
              mother last night,

04:17.289 --> 04:19.089
and I really
                let her have it.

04:19.124 --> 04:21.358
She didn't know what
               hit her. (grunts)

04:21.392 --> 04:23.561
Well, congratulations, Louie!

04:23.595 --> 04:25.429
You did a job
on your mother.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.465
Now it's Miller time.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.002
All right,
                all right.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.937
First of
                all, let me
                give you

04:32.971 --> 04:34.339
a little
                background
                on this.

04:34.373 --> 04:36.408
You see...

04:36.442 --> 04:38.042
my mom belongs

04:38.076 --> 04:41.713
to this club called
              Life Begins At 70.

04:41.715 --> 04:45.350
All right, the
             whole club consists

04:45.384 --> 04:47.418
of three women, two men,

04:47.453 --> 04:51.589
and somebody so shriveled
       up, it's anybody's guess.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.625
Louie,

04:53.659 --> 04:55.493
has it ever occurred to you

04:55.527 --> 04:57.861
that old people have a dignity

04:57.896 --> 05:00.431
and a wisdom and a beauty

05:00.466 --> 05:02.533
that you will never
appreciate or approach,

05:02.568 --> 05:04.535
no matter what age
you get to?

05:04.570 --> 05:06.437
Well, it may look like
            that to you, Reiger,

05:06.471 --> 05:08.339
because you're a little
           closer to the bucket.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.941
Bah!

05:09.975 --> 05:11.843
All right, all
               right, so anyway,

05:11.877 --> 05:13.477
in this little
                   club of Ma's,

05:13.512 --> 05:15.446
they get together
every once in a while

05:15.480 --> 05:18.416
to have a little fun, right?

05:18.450 --> 05:20.919
They have, uh, guest speakers.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.220
This one time,

05:22.254 --> 05:25.189
they had a guy come in
who found a rock,

05:25.257 --> 05:27.525
and he talked about it
for an hour and a half.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.928
A couple of weeks ago,

05:29.962 --> 05:36.067
they had this old bird come in
and show travel slides.

05:36.101 --> 05:38.403
After the excitement died down,

05:38.437 --> 05:41.406
the old guy with the slides
            asked Ma

05:41.440 --> 05:42.973
if he could take her home.

05:43.008 --> 05:44.842
Little shuffle.
     You know what I mean?

05:44.910 --> 05:45.777
(laughs)

05:45.878 --> 05:47.745
So, anyway,
that day,

05:47.780 --> 05:50.582
I work a double shift--

05:50.616 --> 05:52.583
16 hours.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.718
I mean, I'm sweaty,

05:54.753 --> 05:57.655
I'm tired,
I smell like a goat.

05:58.924 --> 06:00.959
All I want to do is go home,

06:00.993 --> 06:03.962
hose myself down
and put on the feedbag.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.364
So, I peek
into the living room.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.399
What do I see?

06:08.433 --> 06:10.401
There's Ma

06:10.435 --> 06:13.537
sitting on the...
on the sofa with this guy.

06:13.572 --> 06:16.407
They're staring out
into space like this.

06:16.441 --> 06:17.909
I thought they were dead.

06:17.943 --> 06:19.677
(laughs)

06:20.780 --> 06:23.748
It turns out, they're smitten.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.716
(laughs)

06:28.654 --> 06:30.421
So anyway...

06:33.092 --> 06:35.025
Hey, schizo?

06:36.695 --> 06:39.630
The next thing you know,
   she's talking about marriage.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.765
Marriage? Check, please.

06:53.979 --> 06:56.448
Come on, big fella.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.754
All right, to make
             a long story short,

07:02.788 --> 07:04.489
she's talking
                 about marriage.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.257
She wants to
                  marry the guy.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.326
I tell her she's nuts,

07:08.360 --> 07:10.562
and then she comes back
     with all these answers

07:10.596 --> 07:12.496
about wanting to share her life

07:12.598 --> 07:14.833
and not having
                many years left.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.769
So then, I come in
        with my topper.

07:17.803 --> 07:24.776
I tell her if she marries
this guy, I'm no longer her son.

07:24.810 --> 07:25.943
Wah!

07:25.977 --> 07:27.211
(laughs)

07:27.246 --> 07:30.448
Oh, Louie,
                how could you?

07:30.482 --> 07:33.050
How could you do this
to your own mother?

07:33.152 --> 07:35.319
You haven't heard the worst,
             Nardo.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.290
The guy she wants to marry...

07:40.325 --> 07:42.760
is Japanese!

07:45.865 --> 07:47.065
So?

07:47.099 --> 07:50.534
My little old Italian mother
           is engaged

07:50.569 --> 07:53.371
to Itsumi Fujimoto.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.606
Huh?

07:55.674 --> 07:58.309
And he's planning
     to take her to Japan.

07:58.343 --> 08:01.079
So you made her
give him up, huh?

08:01.113 --> 08:04.114
And just spoiled
 her last chance at happiness.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.417
You are really a worm!

08:06.485 --> 08:08.086
(snorts)
                            Ugh.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.054
I bet it broke
               her little heart.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.257
She'll get over it.

08:12.291 --> 08:16.027
She cried a little bit,
put a minor curse on me...

08:17.730 --> 08:19.831
MRS. DE PALMA:
Louie? Hey, Louie,

08:19.865 --> 08:21.098
I want to
                    talk to you.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.366
(groans)

08:24.236 --> 08:26.604
Oh. Uh, hey,
             everybody, hold it.

08:26.638 --> 08:29.107
Uh, this is
                      my mother.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.642
I want everybody

08:30.676 --> 08:33.376
to treat her
with enormous respect

08:33.412 --> 08:35.412
and excellent
manners.

08:35.447 --> 08:39.450
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.652
Hey, you're
          forgetting your father

08:41.686 --> 08:43.621
and a cheap
                 bottle of wine?

08:46.692 --> 08:50.428
Oh, Mrs. De Palma, it is
    such a pleasure to meet you.

08:50.462 --> 08:51.862
Who are you?

08:51.897 --> 08:53.698
Oh. Um, I'm
                   Elaine Nardo.

08:53.732 --> 08:55.066
Oh, Louie's girl.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.970
Alex.

09:00.005 --> 09:01.773
ALEX:
                   Yeah, uh, hi,
                  Mrs. De Palma.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.274
I'm Alex Reiger.

09:03.308 --> 09:07.077
Oh, you're the Jewish fella
that Louie's always helping out.

09:09.014 --> 09:10.147
I can't tell you

09:10.182 --> 09:12.516
how much we love your
             son, Mrs. De Palma.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.851
I really can't tell you.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.954
Uh, Tony, uh,
                you're next.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.822
I'm Tony Banta,
                  Mrs. De Palma.

09:17.856 --> 09:18.890
Oh.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.391
I can't believe

09:20.425 --> 09:22.994
what Louie says about you.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.197
What city are we in?

09:29.968 --> 09:32.369
Is... is this a
            trick question?

09:33.505 --> 09:35.006
Well, I'll be darned.

09:36.441 --> 09:37.708
Oh. Hey, Mrs. De Palma,

09:37.742 --> 09:39.410
I've been waiting
                    to meet you.

09:39.444 --> 09:40.644
Um...

09:40.679 --> 09:43.247
(speaking Italian)

09:43.249 --> 09:44.448
Oh.... (speaking Italian)...
 <i>Italiano?</i>

09:44.482 --> 09:45.816
<i>Sì, si.</i>
         Oh.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.351
(speaking Italian)

09:51.890 --> 09:53.825
Oh.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.627
Ma, down here.

09:56.662 --> 09:57.795
Hey, Tony,

09:57.830 --> 09:59.096
what-what...
                what did
                she say?

09:59.131 --> 10:01.632
Well, my Italian's a little
rusty, Alex, but she said...

10:01.667 --> 10:04.836
I think she said, uh, her son's
acting like a jackass.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.571
Or... Or else he's acting
like an asparagus?

10:09.274 --> 10:11.309
No, it's probably jackass.

10:11.343 --> 10:13.644
Well, you are
                     the expert.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.580
New cabbie?

10:21.353 --> 10:23.655
No, no, no, no, no.
            No, no, no.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.957
This is Louie's mother,
         Mrs. De Palma.

10:25.991 --> 10:27.959
Oh.

10:29.394 --> 10:33.965
Your son is one
of the finest human beings

10:33.999 --> 10:36.134
I've ever known
in my life.

10:43.008 --> 10:45.409
And you let <i>him</i> drive a cab?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.749
Look, if this has
                  anything to do

10:51.783 --> 10:53.818
with Itsumi Fujimoto...

10:53.852 --> 10:56.587
Louie, I still want
to marry him.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.322
I thought that
                    was settled.

10:58.356 --> 11:00.558
You-you've got no reason
              to marry that man.

11:00.592 --> 11:02.526
Companionship.

11:02.594 --> 11:05.363
Companionship.
                  Companionship.

11:05.397 --> 11:08.332
Is that all you old
        people ever think about?

11:11.669 --> 11:14.171
Louie...

11:14.206 --> 11:16.507
will you
                    talk to him?

11:16.541 --> 11:18.475
Will you meet him?

11:18.510 --> 11:20.311
Why should I do that?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.779
You meet him,

11:21.813 --> 11:24.949
and if you don't like him,
       I won't marry him.

11:25.817 --> 11:28.653
You promise?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.253
I promise.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.691
Okay.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.526
Will you sit with him?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.095
Sure.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.362
Will you talk to him?

11:38.396 --> 11:39.731
Sure.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.431
Will you be nice to him?

11:41.433 --> 11:43.167
Ma!

11:43.201 --> 11:46.337
I had to go for it.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.724
Hello, my dear.

12:07.759 --> 12:10.661
(groaning)

12:10.696 --> 12:13.397
I take it this is Mr. Fujimoto.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.634
No, this always
     happens to me in bars.

12:20.472 --> 12:22.640
I love your sense of humor.

12:22.708 --> 12:27.277
Speaking of which,
          this is my son, Louie.

12:27.312 --> 12:29.947
How do you do,
           Mr. De Palma?

12:29.982 --> 12:31.115
(grumbling)

12:31.149 --> 12:32.950
Up, up.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.685
Up.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.587
Bow, bow.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.926
All right, you
want to talk to me?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.427
Let's go over here
and talk.

12:43.461 --> 12:44.962
Very well.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.832
Excuse us, Gabriella.

12:47.866 --> 12:50.201
By the way,
you look lovely today.

12:50.235 --> 12:51.602
Thank you.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.838
Come on, people are
trying to eat in here.

12:56.407 --> 12:58.743
I'll just sit here
                      and smoke.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.979
Smoke your brains out,
          crazy lady.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.218
Louie, I understand
        from your mother

13:08.253 --> 13:10.187
that you are opposed

13:10.221 --> 13:12.623
to the idea
    of our getting married.

13:12.657 --> 13:14.558
All right, now let's get
       to the point here.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.195
I got a question for you.

13:18.229 --> 13:20.965
Have you ever known
         another woman?

13:20.967 --> 13:25.469
Of course, I am 83 years old.

13:25.503 --> 13:28.672
Who hasn't known
    another woman at my age?

13:28.674 --> 13:30.875
Well, all right,
  don't chew my head off here.

13:30.909 --> 13:35.078
Ma, you can't marry
        this old geezer.

13:35.113 --> 13:38.115
He's pillowed half the Orient.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.487
Louie, I'm gonna marry him.

13:43.521 --> 13:46.224
You said if I don't like him,
      you won't marry him.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.459
I lied.

13:50.262 --> 13:55.432
Look, I told you this before
 and I'm gonna tell you again,

13:55.467 --> 13:59.937
if you marry this guy,
  I'm not coming home tonight

13:59.972 --> 14:04.375
and I'll never set foot
    in that apartment again.

14:04.409 --> 14:07.278
And I'll no longer be your son.

14:07.312 --> 14:11.315
I'm sorry you feel that way.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.551
Let's go, Itsu.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.827
Sayonara, Louie.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.439
(Louie snoring)

14:35.473 --> 14:36.473
ALEX:
I can't believe
Louie's doing this,

14:36.507 --> 14:37.574
living in the garage.

14:37.608 --> 14:39.110
(LATKA (as Vic):
Hey, guys.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.778
Okay, hey, oh!

14:43.815 --> 14:46.250
Boss man isn't up yet, huh?

14:46.284 --> 14:47.618
No, uh, Vic, he's not.

14:47.652 --> 14:49.219
Tell him that I left early

14:49.254 --> 14:50.821
to beat the weekend traffic.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.956
You found all those
             guys for the condo?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.760
Oh, yeah, yeah, hey,
     congratulate me, men.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.329
The team is assembled
      and we're on our way

14:58.363 --> 15:01.832
to a holiday of hormones.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.735
Okay, pray for powder, soldiers.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.243
(alarm clock buzzing)

15:12.277 --> 15:14.979
(Louie grumbling)

15:15.013 --> 15:18.648
(banging sounds, Louie mumbling)

15:18.717 --> 15:20.217
(stuff clattering)

15:20.251 --> 15:23.186
(Louie snarling, growling)

15:25.357 --> 15:27.791
(Louie coughing, gagging)

15:30.128 --> 15:32.462
(groaning)

15:37.635 --> 15:39.970
(loud yawning)

15:40.005 --> 15:41.305
(groaning)

15:41.339 --> 15:42.306
(yawning)

15:42.340 --> 15:43.574
(groaning)

15:43.608 --> 15:46.209
As my guide, and I watch
                from the bushes,

15:46.244 --> 15:49.380
we are amazed...

15:49.448 --> 15:50.714
by the astounding

15:50.749 --> 15:52.482
similarities
to a human being.

15:55.887 --> 15:59.256
What are you bozos doing here?

15:59.290 --> 16:00.925
What are you all dressed up for?

16:00.959 --> 16:03.227
We're on our way to your
        mother's wedding, Louie.

16:03.261 --> 16:06.730
Oh, is it today?

16:06.764 --> 16:08.365
Yeah.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.201
Well...

16:11.236 --> 16:15.272
I'm afraid you made one
    little mistake, Reiger.

16:15.306 --> 16:18.509
I don't have a mother anymore.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.879
Hey, uh, he's walking his soap.

16:27.485 --> 16:29.420
Louie, Louie.

16:29.454 --> 16:31.187
Get out of here.
       Louie, wait, Louie!

16:31.222 --> 16:32.623
Go on.
           Louie, Louie.

16:32.657 --> 16:34.858
Wait a minute, Louie!

16:34.893 --> 16:36.526
(shower starts)
                    Look, Louie,
                     I wouldn't

16:36.561 --> 16:38.996
be here except that I think
  it might make a big difference

16:39.030 --> 16:41.232
to your mother if you
          showed up there today.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.367
LOUIE:
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, go on.

16:43.401 --> 16:46.870
Oh, come on, Louie, for once in
 your life, don't be so... you.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.478
You think
you know it all, huh?

16:54.512 --> 16:57.681
You think you got it all
figured out, don't you?

17:00.585 --> 17:04.121
Well, let me tell you something.

17:04.155 --> 17:06.756
You get used to a way of life.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.991
You don't pick it.

17:10.028 --> 17:13.464
Me and Ma had a deal.

17:13.498 --> 17:14.798
We had an agreement.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.134
It was unspoken,
  there were no papers signed,

17:18.169 --> 17:20.436
but it was a deal just the same.

17:20.505 --> 17:22.038
And now she's throwing it away.

17:22.073 --> 17:24.141
And let me tell you
    something else, Reiger.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.343
I would've never
       done this to her.

17:26.411 --> 17:27.644
Wait, are you telling me

17:27.679 --> 17:29.980
that you were never
              gonna get married?

17:30.015 --> 17:33.083
Of course I'm gonna get married.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.052
But even if I did get married,

17:35.086 --> 17:38.255
I'd always have a place
in my home for her.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.457
I'd have given her a room.

17:40.492 --> 17:43.894
Maybe even furnished it.

17:43.928 --> 17:47.164
Even if my wife, Fleurette,
       didn't want me to.

17:47.198 --> 17:48.466
Fleurette?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.600
Yeah, whatever
her name will be.

17:50.635 --> 17:51.935
Fleurette?

17:51.970 --> 17:54.205
Yeah, I pulled it
out of the air.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.139
You pull Jane or Sally
        out of the air.

17:56.173 --> 17:58.775
You don't pull Fleurette
        out of the air.

17:58.810 --> 18:00.410
You pull Fleurette out of long,

18:00.444 --> 18:03.380
hot sweaty nights
     of total frustration.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.682
All right, I'm a romantic.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.250
So sue me.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.788
The point is that
Ma is leaving me.

18:10.822 --> 18:16.092
She's busting us up and yet
I look like the bad guy.

18:17.495 --> 18:20.231
Everybody's sympathizing
   with her 'cause she's got

18:20.265 --> 18:22.233
the gray hair,

18:22.267 --> 18:26.070
the little, little face
   and that cute little walk.

18:29.474 --> 18:32.743
And I'm the one who had his
life yanked out, Reiger.

18:34.145 --> 18:38.082
That woman means
   everything to me, Reiger.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.384
She's my mama.

18:40.418 --> 18:43.553
And all the things
she did for me.

18:45.489 --> 18:51.295
She cooked my food,
             cleaned my clothes,

18:51.329 --> 18:54.598
she clipped my toenails.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.534
Clipped your toenails, Lou?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.202
That woman clipped
your toenails,

18:59.237 --> 19:01.037
and you're not gonna
go to the wedding?

19:04.075 --> 19:07.144
God, when you put it
                    like that...

19:10.916 --> 19:12.917
You're right, Reiger,
                     I gotta go.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.052
Of course I gotta go.
     Of course, Lou!

19:15.086 --> 19:15.952
Oh, but I don't know.

19:15.986 --> 19:17.020
I'm not sure.

19:17.054 --> 19:18.922
It might be a mistake
                 the way I feel.

19:18.956 --> 19:20.924
I mean, it might
                work on my guts.

19:20.958 --> 19:23.694
You know, there's no telling
   what I'd do when I get there.

19:23.728 --> 19:26.529
There's a nasty side to
           me you've never seen.

19:26.598 --> 19:27.664
I've seen it.

19:27.698 --> 19:30.100
Look, Lou, see,
 you're not gonna do anything.

19:30.134 --> 19:32.035
I'm telling you, you're not
 gonna do anything to ruin it.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.804
If you can't trust yourself,
           trust me.

19:36.340 --> 19:39.209
You're sure?
I'm sure, Lou,
I'm sure.

19:39.243 --> 19:41.745
You're right, Reiger,
                   I'm gonna go.

19:41.747 --> 19:42.980
Good, Lou, good.

19:43.014 --> 19:44.581
You know something, Reiger?

19:44.615 --> 19:45.448
What?

19:45.483 --> 19:46.650
I feel great!

19:46.685 --> 19:49.720
I feel like I got a
warm glow inside me.

19:49.754 --> 19:51.188
And you know why?

19:51.222 --> 19:52.456
Why, Lou, why?

19:52.490 --> 19:56.493
Because no matter what
    happens at that wedding,

19:56.527 --> 19:59.529
no matter what disgusting
      and revolting thing

19:59.563 --> 20:02.565
that I might do,
        it's your fault.

20:16.881 --> 20:19.483
ELAINE:
I think everything
is so beautiful.

20:19.517 --> 20:20.718
TONY: Yeah.

20:20.752 --> 20:22.318
This is a joke.

20:22.353 --> 20:23.520
Louie.

20:23.554 --> 20:26.423
Boss, you'll love it.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.827
It's a very moving ceremony.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.762
How do you know, Iggy?

20:31.796 --> 20:36.567
I'm a student of the
       world's religions.

20:36.601 --> 20:38.335
It figures.

20:38.369 --> 20:43.973
A shinto wedding is one of the
three best ways to get married.

20:44.008 --> 20:49.780
The best weddings
   are Polish for the dancing

20:49.814 --> 20:52.682
and Shinto for the poetry.

20:52.717 --> 20:53.617
What's the third?

20:53.651 --> 20:56.987
Vegas.

20:57.021 --> 20:58.421
For the glitter.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.556
Oh.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.258
I can't take this.
                          Louie!

21:01.292 --> 21:02.960
Louie, take it easy.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.962
This is a holy place.

21:06.230 --> 21:10.067
Who's that guy?

21:10.101 --> 21:12.402
This is the Shinto priest

21:12.470 --> 21:14.270
and his attendants.

21:18.843 --> 21:21.177
He brought the whole family.

21:25.116 --> 21:26.416
(grumbling)

21:26.451 --> 21:28.151
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.

21:28.219 --> 21:30.354
Next comes the groom

21:30.388 --> 21:32.155
and then the bride.

21:42.066 --> 21:43.734
Dad.

21:43.768 --> 21:45.602
This is ridiculous!

21:45.636 --> 21:47.437
My mother can't do this.

21:47.471 --> 21:48.905
She'll never adapt!

21:52.711 --> 21:53.911
Who's that?

21:55.780 --> 21:57.547
Oh, no!

21:57.581 --> 21:59.450
(pounding floor)

22:01.519 --> 22:03.887
LOUIE:
That's mom!

22:03.921 --> 22:07.191
She looks like a scarecrow
in a rice paddy.

22:11.162 --> 22:15.032
JIM:
This is the
purification rite.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.501
He's casting out the demons.

22:17.535 --> 22:19.335
Louie, you'd better
           hang on to your seat.

22:22.273 --> 22:24.641
I'm glad you're having
a good time, Nardo.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.947
This is the sacred <i>norito.</i>

22:30.949 --> 22:34.484
It's a message
to the divine power

22:34.518 --> 22:37.054
that a marriage is
about to take place.

22:37.088 --> 22:39.723
It's fun being
  the smart one.

22:47.332 --> 22:50.600
This is the <i>san san kudo.</i>

22:52.603 --> 22:55.839
After your mother drinks
from that cup three times,

22:55.873 --> 22:57.874
she'll be married.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.978
She will?!
                            Yep.
       Hang on, Louie, Louie.

                          One...

23:07.352 --> 23:08.618
Two...

23:08.653 --> 23:09.752
I gotta stop this!
                 Louie, no!

23:09.787 --> 23:10.787
Mom!

23:11.723 --> 23:13.323
ALEX:
Please don't, Louie.

23:13.357 --> 23:14.457
Too late.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.703
All right, in that case...

23:40.284 --> 23:42.185
I give you my blessing.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.554
<i>Grazie, figlio mio.</i>

23:52.296 --> 23:55.332
<i>Grazie.</i>
