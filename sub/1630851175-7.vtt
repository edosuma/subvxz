00:10.788 --> 00:13.260
Previously on
The Last Man...

00:13.293 --> 00:15.464
We've got eyes on Agent Burgin.
Holed up in a church.

00:15.497 --> 00:17.602
‐Nowhere, Pennsylvania.
‐I have a visual.

00:17.636 --> 00:19.661
Permission to engage?

00:19.695 --> 00:22.567
Can you believe
Jennifer Brown is president?

00:22.601 --> 00:24.705
She's invincible.

00:24.738 --> 00:26.107
What if she's not?

00:26.140 --> 00:28.679
You know, right?
That you sleepwalk.

00:28.713 --> 00:29.815
You were up in the loft
last night.

00:29.848 --> 00:31.117
You could have broken your neck.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.421
They're after her. Not us.

00:33.455 --> 00:35.693
I just betrayed her because
you convinced me.

00:35.727 --> 00:37.062
No, "convinced" is strong.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.016
‐Did she see you?
‐No. No.

00:47.049 --> 00:48.553
No, she didn't see me.

00:48.586 --> 00:50.455
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your fucking lab.

00:50.489 --> 00:52.727
Until we get to San Francisco,
this is my show.

01:23.656 --> 01:24.925
‐What?

01:24.958 --> 01:27.631
Ah... You think we should‐‐

01:27.664 --> 01:29.835
I don't know‐‐
make some sort of gesture,

01:29.868 --> 01:31.572
like an olive branch?

01:31.605 --> 01:34.176
Like what? Flowers?

01:34.210 --> 01:37.517
Just say we're sorry, maybe?

01:37.550 --> 01:39.688
I'm not sorry.

01:39.721 --> 01:42.192
‐Yeah, of course you're not.

01:42.226 --> 01:44.163
Hey, buddy.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.971
She lied to us,
almost got us killed.

01:49.608 --> 01:50.877
‐Got some extra fuel.
‐Yeah, I saw that.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.479
That's, um, that was smart.

01:54.685 --> 01:56.622
Good thinking.

01:56.655 --> 01:59.460
Empty the camper.
You two can ride in back.

02:01.665 --> 02:03.234
Yup. I think that did it.

02:03.268 --> 02:04.871
I don't think
she's angry anymore.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.857
Yeah, they know
it's a performance,

02:30.890 --> 02:32.994
so even if it's real,
they can't buy in though

02:33.028 --> 02:35.065
‐unless the stakes
are relatable.
‐Like what?

02:35.098 --> 02:36.769
‐Like buried alive?
‐Uh‐huh?

02:36.802 --> 02:39.006
Only really works if there's
something else in the box.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.144
‐Yeah, like what?
‐Like, uh, I don't know,

02:41.177 --> 02:42.747
a scorpion.
Or, like, a big‐ass spider.

02:42.781 --> 02:45.085
Life and death, it's too
theoretical, and besides,

02:45.118 --> 02:47.256
people don't think you're gonna
risk death for a magic show.

02:47.289 --> 02:49.761
They don't know
what an idiot you are.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.899
But if the trick
goes wrong‐‐ hey.

02:51.932 --> 02:54.938
But if the trick goes wrong

02:54.971 --> 02:56.842
and all my fingernails
are ripped out...

02:56.875 --> 02:58.244
‐Jesus.
‐Exactly.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.883
That is something that
a regular person can imagine.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.252
Okay.

03:02.286 --> 03:03.823
Have you ever
tied a knot before?

03:08.064 --> 03:10.737
You will not be able
to get out of this.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.774
It's important that
you believe that.

03:12.807 --> 03:14.811
‐Hey, buddy. Yeah.

03:30.175 --> 03:31.812
‐Shit!

05:12.212 --> 05:15.218
‐Yorick?

05:15.252 --> 05:18.324
‐Hey. Yorick.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.936
Shh. It's okay, it's okay, Amp.

05:23.969 --> 05:25.673
He's alive.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.184
You're okay.

05:33.354 --> 05:35.158
355?

05:47.149 --> 05:48.853
Okay.

06:03.381 --> 06:05.452
355?

06:12.199 --> 06:17.075
Help! Help!

06:25.526 --> 06:27.730
Shit.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.333
Come on, Yorick.

06:29.366 --> 06:31.872
Come on. Come on. Come on.

06:31.905 --> 06:34.076
Come on.

06:40.823 --> 06:43.094
CIA, maybe;
could be foreign‐made;

06:43.127 --> 06:46.200
certainly not military‐issue.

06:46.234 --> 06:48.004
How long were you unconscious?

06:48.037 --> 06:49.139
Couple of hours.

06:49.173 --> 06:50.408
Woke up,
and our boots were gone.

06:50.442 --> 06:53.047
We tracked her from
Boston. The soldiers at Harvard

06:53.081 --> 06:54.918
said that she was
looking for a scientist.

06:54.951 --> 06:56.254
Dr. Allison Mann.

06:56.287 --> 06:58.024
Some kind of geneticist.

06:58.057 --> 06:59.928
‐You get a visual on Dr. Mann?
‐No.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.065
Uh, but...

07:02.099 --> 07:03.969
What?

07:05.305 --> 07:07.142
I didn't see the doctor,

07:07.175 --> 07:09.079
but the third person
in the church,

07:09.113 --> 07:11.217
it was a man. I saw him.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.421
‐A man?
‐Burgin was protecting him.

07:13.454 --> 07:15.191
‐How close were you?
‐Close enough.

07:15.225 --> 07:17.029
‐Ten feet, maybe less?
‐Well, let's

07:17.062 --> 07:19.133
all acknowledge
there are men out there.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.337
‐I don't think
he was transgender, ma'am.
‐You're telling me you can

07:21.370 --> 07:22.472
verify someone's chromosomes
from ten feet?

07:22.507 --> 07:25.278
No, but why else

07:25.312 --> 07:27.416
would Agent Burgin be
looking for a geneticist?

07:27.449 --> 07:29.253
If she's protecting an asset...

07:29.286 --> 07:31.357
‐A survivor.
‐Oh, here we go.

07:31.390 --> 07:34.396
Well, it would explain
a few things, wouldn't it?

07:34.430 --> 07:37.035
Did you see him? This survivor?

07:37.069 --> 07:39.206
I'm asking them.

07:39.239 --> 07:41.444
‐No, ma'am.
‐No.

07:42.914 --> 07:45.586
With all due respect, Captain,
you were tranquilized.

07:45.619 --> 07:47.924
Your memory isn't
exactly reliable.

07:49.159 --> 07:50.896
I know what I saw.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.502
Did you notice
the crowds outside?

07:53.535 --> 07:55.840
‐Yes, ma'am.
‐The White House is gone.

07:55.873 --> 07:58.879
Those people doused one
of our guards with gasoline,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.583
tried to light her on fire.

08:00.616 --> 08:03.488
They will jump at anything that
has a whiff of conspiracy.

08:03.522 --> 08:05.458
So you'd better be sure.

08:05.492 --> 08:07.997
I'm sure as I can be.

08:08.031 --> 08:11.070
Caucasian, brown hair,
about six feet tall.

08:11.103 --> 08:13.107
Tell them the rest.

08:13.141 --> 08:15.445
"The rest"?

08:15.478 --> 08:17.950
There was an animal with him,
on his shoulder.

08:17.984 --> 08:19.453
‐Oh.
‐I know how it sounds.

08:19.486 --> 08:21.057
I think we're done here, Peggy.

08:21.090 --> 08:24.163
‐What kind of animal?
‐It matters?

08:24.196 --> 08:25.198
A monkey, ma'am.

08:25.231 --> 08:26.835
Thank you, Captain.

08:29.507 --> 08:31.177
Fuck.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.982
Get them reassigned.

08:34.016 --> 08:36.120
I don't want them spreading
that story in this building.

08:36.153 --> 08:37.857
‐Yes, ma'am.
‐Make it happen today.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.099
We're ready for you now,
Madam President.

08:42.132 --> 08:44.303
Thank you, Abby, lead the way.

08:53.488 --> 08:55.458
Do I look okay?
I mean, not okay,

08:55.492 --> 08:58.297
‐just not too polished.
‐You've threaded
the needle perfectly.

08:58.331 --> 09:00.936
All right. Let's do this.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.573
‐WOMAN Testing.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.043
Testing, one, two, three.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.880
Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.884
They're gonna throw her

09:07.917 --> 09:11.057
on a‐‐ on a Humvee like she's
Abraham fricking Lincoln

09:11.090 --> 09:12.627
on a whistle‐stop tour?

09:12.660 --> 09:16.467
Moths.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.071
HAWKEYE No,
I'd rather be a live chicken.

09:18.104 --> 09:20.075
In the Pentagon.

09:20.108 --> 09:21.444
This is my favorite sweater.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.314
Leave Jennifer Brown alone,
okay?

09:23.347 --> 09:25.686
‐She's a decent human being.

09:25.719 --> 09:26.822
She called Daddy a sexist
to score

09:26.855 --> 09:29.126
‐some cheap political points.

09:29.159 --> 09:31.030
And now she's sitting
in his chair...

09:31.063 --> 09:33.067
HAWKEYE I was hoping
I'd make it to Thursday.

09:33.101 --> 09:35.371
...while you sit here
watching your 47th episode

09:35.405 --> 09:38.044
‐of MASH.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.583
Well, I'm not the queen
of England, Kimberly.

09:40.616 --> 09:42.653
No one cares what I have to say.

09:42.687 --> 09:45.191
That's because you haven't
said anything. I mean,

09:45.225 --> 09:47.329
‐at least Regina is out there...

09:47.362 --> 09:48.565
Regina's a nutjob.

09:48.599 --> 09:50.636
And your father would be
the first to say so.

09:50.669 --> 09:52.239
Daddy chose her.

09:52.272 --> 09:55.078
She was loyal to him,
which means she's loyal to us.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.917
‐These are all ruined.

10:01.357 --> 10:03.494
A‐Are you gonna use
all those pillows?

10:03.529 --> 10:05.398
You're not giving that girl
my pillows.

10:05.432 --> 10:08.539
Her name is Christine
and she's pregnant.

10:09.974 --> 10:11.444
She needs friends.

10:15.185 --> 10:17.189
‐Oh...

10:17.222 --> 10:20.161
‐Your dad loved this one.
‐You've got a good sense
of humor,

10:20.195 --> 10:21.497
‐but a lousy sense of timing.
‐Come here.

10:21.531 --> 10:22.600
Fire that weapon.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.102
‐Fire it?

10:24.136 --> 10:25.539
I don't even like looking at it.

10:25.573 --> 10:27.977
Okay, you know what?
That's it. Get up.

10:29.012 --> 10:31.283
Get up! We're all suffering.

10:31.317 --> 10:34.089
Suffering? Really?

10:34.122 --> 10:35.960
Well, if you shed
even half a tear,

10:35.993 --> 10:37.630
your boys would
have to split it.

10:37.663 --> 10:40.068
POTTER
Fire the gun, Hawkeye.

10:40.101 --> 10:42.205
Look, Colonel...

10:42.239 --> 10:44.109
I'm gonna see them again.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.015
Yeah.
When you're dead.

10:47.048 --> 10:49.219
But I will not
inflict their wounds.

10:49.253 --> 10:51.123
You can't just sit there.

11:28.765 --> 11:31.337
Amp?

11:36.113 --> 11:37.516
Amp?

12:06.173 --> 12:08.044
Amp?

12:30.321 --> 12:31.758
Oh, God, don't touch it.

12:31.791 --> 12:35.098
She's bleeding.
Look at her little paw.

12:35.131 --> 12:37.102
Yeah, did you
hear about the woman

12:37.135 --> 12:39.807
who got her face ripped off
by a monkey in Connecticut?

12:39.841 --> 12:42.312
What the hell was a monkey
doing in Connecticut, huh?

12:43.849 --> 12:45.552
You're awake.

12:48.892 --> 12:50.261
Uh...

13:00.481 --> 13:02.452
Start with why you're here.

13:02.485 --> 13:04.891
Well, I don't know
where "here" is.

13:04.924 --> 13:08.264
Um, the people I was
in the truck with...

13:08.297 --> 13:09.867
You don't have to
worry about them.

13:09.901 --> 13:13.608
Okay. Um, listen, can I,
can I take him out of there?

13:13.642 --> 13:15.779
‐He's scared.
‐He?

13:16.948 --> 13:19.419
Uh, yeah.

13:19.453 --> 13:22.860
Yes. He's a...

13:22.893 --> 13:25.699
Yeah, I don't know how.
Um... Hey, hey.

13:25.733 --> 13:28.337
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

13:28.371 --> 13:30.576
‐So, where are my friends?
‐Friends?

13:30.609 --> 13:32.713
‐W‐What friends?
‐So you've got a Y chromosome?

13:32.747 --> 13:34.884
‐How did you survive?

13:34.917 --> 13:37.188
I, uh...

13:37.222 --> 13:40.428
I have no idea. I don't‐‐
uh, maybe I'm cursed.

13:42.298 --> 13:44.169
I'm not cursed
with a Y chromosome,

13:44.202 --> 13:46.407
but I'm cursed in
plenty of other ways.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.679
Thank you. Holy shit.

13:48.712 --> 13:50.783
Toast.

13:50.816 --> 13:52.853
This...

13:52.887 --> 13:54.489
Um...

13:54.524 --> 13:56.628
You guys have electricity.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.199
‐How?
‐Teamwork.

13:59.232 --> 14:01.504
‐Come on, buddy.
‐I imagine that you

14:01.538 --> 14:03.474
attract quite a bit
of attention.

14:03.508 --> 14:06.480
You know, more than before,
that's for sure.

14:06.514 --> 14:08.719
Oh, God.

14:08.752 --> 14:10.556
Mmm.

14:10.589 --> 14:12.660
Are there other survivors?

14:12.693 --> 14:15.331
Well, God, I hope so.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.913
Um...

14:22.947 --> 14:27.623
So, uh, yeah, my friends?
The other people in the truck?

14:27.656 --> 14:28.892
Thought you said
his hands were tied.

14:28.925 --> 14:30.395
They were.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.900
‐Your friends tied you up?
‐Oh, no. No, no.

14:32.933 --> 14:35.973
I was, um...
I was doing a trick.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.444
‐A trick?
‐Yeah, I'm an escape artist.

14:38.477 --> 14:41.718
‐Is that a joke?
‐Jokes are funny.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.924
We thought you were
being held captive.

14:44.957 --> 14:46.761
Uh, no.

14:46.795 --> 14:48.431
No.

14:52.338 --> 14:54.209
W‐Where are they?
Are they okay?

15:14.349 --> 15:16.320
Ah...

16:43.728 --> 16:45.966
We need help in here!

16:50.007 --> 16:51.711
Hello?

16:53.849 --> 16:56.353
‐Hey!
‐Shit.

16:56.386 --> 16:58.992
We need help in here!

17:00.428 --> 17:03.467
Anybody! Come on!

17:05.806 --> 17:07.877
Hey!

17:07.910 --> 17:10.114
We need help in here!

17:11.818 --> 17:13.722
Hello?! Come on!

17:13.755 --> 17:15.726
Where are we?

17:16.761 --> 17:19.567
‐What happened?
‐You crashed the truck.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.873
People came out of the woods,
brought us here.

17:24.109 --> 17:25.746
Where's Yorick?

17:25.779 --> 17:27.917
They took him off somewhere.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.820
He was unconscious.

17:34.797 --> 17:36.534
Shit.

17:40.107 --> 17:41.476
‐Hey, hey, hey, hey. Sit.
‐No.

17:41.511 --> 17:43.047
Sit. Sit down.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.586
Tell me everything
you can remember.

17:45.619 --> 17:47.823
How many were there?

17:47.856 --> 17:49.694
How'd they get in here?

17:50.996 --> 17:53.000
Four, I think.

17:53.033 --> 17:54.704
Or five.

17:54.737 --> 17:57.075
Two of them took Yorick,
the others brought us here.

17:57.108 --> 17:58.645
Were they armed?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.716
Yeah.

18:00.749 --> 18:03.521
Shotguns? Pistols?
Semiautos, what?

18:03.555 --> 18:05.826
I don't know.
Little guns. Big guns.

18:05.859 --> 18:07.529
They all had guns.

18:12.105 --> 18:15.011
‐Did you catch any names?
‐Uh...

18:15.044 --> 18:18.618
‐How'd they communicate?
‐It happened pretty fast.

18:19.687 --> 18:20.756
What are you doing?

18:20.789 --> 18:22.626
‐What's the plan?
‐I don't know,

18:22.660 --> 18:24.429
last time I told you the plan,

18:24.462 --> 18:26.834
you fucked off
in the middle of the night

18:26.868 --> 18:28.437
with humanity's last hope.

18:28.470 --> 18:31.511
You know,
I'm a little bit smart.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.449
‐I might be able to contribute.
‐No, no.

18:34.482 --> 18:38.525
I'll get us out of here,
we'll go find Yorick. Just‐‐

18:38.558 --> 18:40.161
shit‐‐ stop talking.

18:40.194 --> 18:43.868
No, no, you're right.
You got this.

18:43.902 --> 18:46.741
Long as there aren't any trees
between here and California,

18:46.774 --> 18:48.477
we should be good.

18:51.951 --> 18:54.155
The buses are available now

18:54.189 --> 18:56.861
to take you to
the Safe Settlement Zone

18:56.894 --> 18:58.698
just outside the city.

18:58.732 --> 19:02.973
There's hot food, showers,
medical attention.

19:03.007 --> 19:05.979
Of course, you have
every right to stay,

19:06.013 --> 19:09.119
protest, peaceably assemble.

19:09.152 --> 19:11.023
But we want you to be safe.

19:11.056 --> 19:15.097
Take advantage of access
to proper shelter and care.

19:15.131 --> 19:20.642
Though we do not yet know
what caused this...

19:20.676 --> 19:22.613
Sorry.

19:24.249 --> 19:27.255
...this terrible event,

19:27.288 --> 19:32.231
we are making enormous strides
every day...

19:34.169 --> 19:35.906
‐Ma'am?
‐Where are you going?
‐Ma'am?

19:35.939 --> 19:37.241
‐It's okay.
‐Please.
‐Madam President.

19:37.275 --> 19:40.147
‐There's somebody out there.
‐Ma'am, it's not safe.

19:43.020 --> 19:45.057
It's okay. It's okay.

19:45.091 --> 19:48.030
Let her through!
Let her through!

19:48.063 --> 19:49.667
It's okay.

19:51.971 --> 19:53.107
Beth.

19:57.348 --> 19:59.052
Thank you.

20:02.559 --> 20:06.934
You are a sight for sore eyes.

20:06.968 --> 20:08.137
Where's Hero?

20:09.305 --> 20:11.744
Well, we couldn't find her.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.982
‐Oh, I'm sorry.
‐Come. Sit.

20:14.015 --> 20:17.288
What about you?
Your family? Your mom?

20:18.658 --> 20:19.760
Oh...

20:21.764 --> 20:24.102
Yeah. A few weeks after.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.607
The doctors didn't
have time for her.

20:26.641 --> 20:28.711
Well, did you make it?
Were you with her?

20:28.745 --> 20:33.755
No. Uh, the roads were...
I didn't make it.

20:33.788 --> 20:35.659
Oh.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.663
I'm so sorry. If I...

20:37.696 --> 20:39.600
if I could have helped, I‐I...

20:39.633 --> 20:40.969
I could have made a call, or...

20:41.002 --> 20:43.040
I know. Thank you.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.852
Wow. Where were you when...

20:48.885 --> 20:51.223
I was on my bike.

20:51.256 --> 20:53.360
Um, I woke up in triage.

20:53.393 --> 20:55.064
They told me what happened.

20:55.097 --> 20:57.368
‐Yeah.
‐It didn't feel real.

20:57.401 --> 20:59.673
But I could walk so...

21:00.942 --> 21:04.617
I made it back to our street,
but I couldn't go in.

21:04.650 --> 21:07.790
I couldn't see him like that.

21:12.933 --> 21:14.102
You must be very hungry.

21:14.135 --> 21:16.741
I'll have Christine
bring up some food, okay?

21:19.078 --> 21:21.216
I can't believe
you're the president.

21:21.249 --> 21:25.725
Yeah.
Yeah, don't get me started.

21:25.759 --> 21:26.994
It's a dead end.

21:27.028 --> 21:29.265
There's no proof that
Burgin killed the pilots,

21:29.299 --> 21:31.871
much less that it was
ordered by the president.

21:31.904 --> 21:34.142
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

21:34.175 --> 21:37.683
‐Kimber, refill?
‐What did the soldiers say?

21:37.716 --> 21:39.419
‐Was there anyone with her?
‐Two others.

21:39.452 --> 21:41.691
‐Kimberly.
‐Hero?

21:41.724 --> 21:43.093
They were hit
with tranquilizers.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.699
Their stories were
all over the place.

21:45.732 --> 21:47.936
But no, I mean,
it didn't sound like it.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.640
Hero is, um, kind of short,

21:49.673 --> 21:52.746
doesn't really brush her hair.
She looks like a drug addict.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.184
‐That's not the
description they gave.
‐What was the description?

21:55.217 --> 21:57.121
‐Give it a rest, Kimber.
‐I'm telling you,
it's a dead end.

21:57.155 --> 21:59.092
‐Can you just tell me?
‐REGINA Okay.

21:59.125 --> 22:02.198
Uh, six feet tall with a monkey
on his shoulder. You happy?

22:09.112 --> 22:11.349
Truck was hauling ass
when you crashed.

22:11.383 --> 22:13.153
‐Was somebody chasing you?
‐No.

22:13.187 --> 22:16.092
No, we just, uh, you know,
we just want to cover

22:16.126 --> 22:18.230
as much ground as possible.
Can I...

22:20.100 --> 22:21.871
Look, I'd really like
to see my friends now.

22:21.904 --> 22:24.342
‐They're being looked after.
‐Are you in charge?

22:24.375 --> 22:25.344
‐No.
‐No one's in charge.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.714
No one's in char‐‐ Okay.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.083
Cool, so like a utopia,

22:28.116 --> 22:30.387
but, uh, but with hostages.

22:30.421 --> 22:31.958
No one's keeping you a hostage.

22:31.991 --> 22:33.427
‐So I can go?
‐No.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.866
Well, that sort of
feels like a hostage.

22:35.899 --> 22:39.172
We make decisions as a group.

22:39.205 --> 22:44.315
And we have not decided what
we are going to do with you yet.

22:44.349 --> 22:48.457
Okay, look, I'm not valuable.
Okay? I promise.

22:48.490 --> 22:50.862
So if you think you can‐‐
no, if you think you can sell me

22:50.896 --> 22:53.400
‐or, like, trade me...
‐You hear this motherfucker?
‐Yeah.

22:53.433 --> 22:56.473
‐He thinks he's valuable.
‐"I am not valuable."

22:56.507 --> 22:57.776
That's pretty sad, man.
You got to, like,

22:57.809 --> 22:59.813
work on that self‐esteem,
you know?

22:59.847 --> 23:02.351
We've got men here.
We're not impressed.

23:05.457 --> 23:07.495
Are you guys cops?

23:07.529 --> 23:09.465
‐No.

23:09.499 --> 23:12.004
Who's Beth?

23:13.307 --> 23:15.477
You said her name in your sleep.

23:17.549 --> 23:19.118
Why did I wake up naked?

23:19.152 --> 23:20.989
‐Jesus, Sonia. What the fuck?

23:22.258 --> 23:25.231
H‐His clothes were filthy,
they were covered in blood.

23:25.264 --> 23:27.435
‐We had to strip them off.
‐Uh, "we"?

23:27.468 --> 23:28.470
This, uh‐‐
was this a group activity?

23:28.504 --> 23:31.744
Hey, don't get all worked up.
It was just me.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.781
And it wasn't any great honor,
okay?

23:33.815 --> 23:35.952
Okay, this Beth,

23:35.986 --> 23:37.421
was she the driver
or the other one?

23:37.455 --> 23:40.762
Uh, she's my girlfriend,
and I don't know where she is.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.131
Oh.

23:42.164 --> 23:44.235
There was a small arsenal
in the back of that truck.

23:44.269 --> 23:45.538
Yeah, I don't know
if you all have done

23:45.572 --> 23:47.308
much traveling recently,
but things are, uh,

23:47.341 --> 23:48.377
getting a little weird
out there.

23:48.410 --> 23:50.180
Military gear.

23:50.214 --> 23:51.817
You want it? It's yours.

23:53.588 --> 23:56.928
‐Who is that?
‐The welcoming committee.

24:02.171 --> 24:04.042
You want me to...?

24:08.250 --> 24:10.087
Listen, I can't leave him.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.384
You gonna hang yourself?

24:25.417 --> 24:26.854
I need a weapon.

24:26.887 --> 24:28.490
That's a shoelace.

24:29.994 --> 24:31.429
You know what
a building smells like

24:31.463 --> 24:32.899
when hundreds of people
die inside it?

24:32.933 --> 24:34.503
Unfortunately.

24:34.536 --> 24:36.807
‐Take a deep breath.

24:39.012 --> 24:42.184
‐Anything?

24:42.218 --> 24:44.122
This is a women's prison.

24:44.155 --> 24:46.192
Nail marks.
Blood on the wall.

24:46.226 --> 24:48.531
‐You think?
‐Someone did everything
they could to get out of here.

24:48.564 --> 24:50.134
And they didn't die in here.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.038
And if she found a way out,
my guess is

24:52.071 --> 24:53.875
she'll do whatever it takes
to stay out.

24:53.908 --> 24:55.310
So, you're saying
that if we get out,

24:55.344 --> 24:57.582
there might be hundreds
of convicts waiting for us?

24:59.920 --> 25:03.861
I would be worried, but now
you've got that shoelace.

25:09.105 --> 25:11.544
You know, back at the Pentagon,
we put together a list of about

25:11.577 --> 25:13.614
30 research scientists
who might be able to help out.

25:13.648 --> 25:17.889
Brilliant.
Geniuses, all of them.

25:18.925 --> 25:23.200
Well, I don't know how you
quantify genius, but...

25:23.233 --> 25:25.437
You weren't on that list.

25:25.471 --> 25:28.644
‐What?
‐Disqualified.

25:28.678 --> 25:30.347
‐Disqualified?
‐Yeah.

25:30.381 --> 25:31.951
Something about being a traitor
to your country.

25:31.984 --> 25:33.588
This is about the Saudis?

25:33.621 --> 25:35.658
See, this is why I don't
trust the government.

25:35.692 --> 25:38.163
Do you have any idea how
difficult it is to get funding?

25:38.196 --> 25:41.102
The point is,
stop being a pain in my ass.

25:41.136 --> 25:43.473
There are plenty of other
scientists who can help.

25:43.508 --> 25:44.643
Oh, well, they aren't me.

25:44.676 --> 25:47.048
I may not be able
to quantify genius,

25:47.081 --> 25:49.085
but I can quantify
being a pussy, and...

25:49.118 --> 25:51.356
Look, just stay away
from Yorick, okay?

25:51.389 --> 25:53.661
Stop putting those
dumbass ideas in his head.

25:53.694 --> 25:57.034
Oh, please. He has
dumbass ideas all by himself.

26:02.111 --> 26:03.915
Are you okay?

26:06.687 --> 26:08.190
I'm fine.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.931
Course you are.

26:16.707 --> 26:18.611
I said I'm fine.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.314
Shut up.

26:23.053 --> 26:25.057
Ouch.

26:31.069 --> 26:32.506
You need a doctor.

26:35.277 --> 26:38.216
I'm not that kind of doctor.

26:41.557 --> 26:43.961
Ah...

26:47.334 --> 26:49.272
Get off of me.

26:50.474 --> 26:52.144
I'll do it.

27:02.732 --> 27:06.607
What's your deal? Back home.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.011
You got someone who
knows your real name?

27:10.314 --> 27:12.418
Husband? Wife?

27:12.451 --> 27:15.491
Mm.

27:15.525 --> 27:18.230
‐Family?
‐Dead.

27:20.735 --> 27:22.037
Sorry.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.348
Mm.

27:27.381 --> 27:30.387
It was a long time ago.
I was 12.

27:33.059 --> 27:34.663
It was a car accident.

27:38.671 --> 27:40.708
Let me do the talking.

27:48.691 --> 27:51.429
Uh...

27:51.462 --> 27:52.532
Hi.

27:56.339 --> 27:58.210
YORICK
They have a well,
they have fucking electricity.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.347
They asked if we were followed.
They wanted to know

28:00.380 --> 28:02.218
who you guys were.
They wanted to know about Amp.

28:02.251 --> 28:03.153
They gave me toast.

28:03.186 --> 28:04.488
‐How many are there?
‐A lot.

28:04.523 --> 28:06.192
Dozens. I don't know.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.330
‐50, maybe more.
‐Why'd
they bring you here?

28:08.363 --> 28:09.766
Uh, they were having a meeting,
I think.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.204
Like, a "what do we do
about them" meeting.

28:12.238 --> 28:14.543
Some of them were
serving life sentences.

28:14.576 --> 28:16.312
So if they think
we're a threat...

28:19.385 --> 28:22.759
What? You trailed off.

28:22.792 --> 28:26.600
They're gonna kill us.
That's what she's saying.

28:26.634 --> 28:30.542
‐They are going to kill us.
‐No, I, uh...

28:30.575 --> 28:33.380
I don't know,
I don't think so. No.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.352
Well, at least one of us
will die ignorant.

28:40.193 --> 28:42.498
‐He was here.
In this building?
‐All due respect,

28:42.532 --> 28:44.435
"my mother saw a monkey"
isn't gonna cut it.

28:44.468 --> 28:46.272
She's barely left this room.

28:46.306 --> 28:48.778
I mean, she told me about him,
and I didn't believe her.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.515
No one else out there
is going to.

28:50.548 --> 28:52.318
Okay, then we
confront Jennifer alone.

28:52.351 --> 28:54.388
No, no, no.
She's not gonna blink.

28:54.422 --> 28:56.226
This building is packed
with a bunch of atheist,

28:56.259 --> 28:57.529
Ivy League ass kissers.

28:57.562 --> 29:01.503
‐They could be in on it.
‐But the killing of
two American pilots?

29:01.537 --> 29:03.774
‐I mean, did she know some...
‐We need proof.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.310
What more do you want?

29:05.344 --> 29:08.250
I wish I still had my show.

29:08.283 --> 29:10.722
Well, you don't.
We need real allies,

29:10.755 --> 29:12.324
not tinfoil hats.

29:12.358 --> 29:14.529
We‐we need members of her
own party, the‐the military.

29:14.563 --> 29:16.132
Oh, well,
that shouldn't be hard.

29:16.165 --> 29:18.203
Jennifer's son is alive,
and everybody else watched

29:18.236 --> 29:20.508
their kids choke to death
on their own insides.

29:23.514 --> 29:26.820
Kim, there's an angry mob
out there looking

29:26.854 --> 29:28.290
for someone to blame.

29:28.323 --> 29:30.127
We don't just
want the presidency.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.431
We want him.

29:32.464 --> 29:35.404
Yorick Brown.

29:35.437 --> 29:38.276
He is the key to putting
the world back together again.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.180
He is the only thing
that matters now.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.819
But you said he was a beta boy
who did magic tricks.

29:42.852 --> 29:44.656
God chose him!

29:45.725 --> 29:48.430
It is not up to us
to question that.

29:48.463 --> 29:49.900
We have to bring him here.

29:49.933 --> 29:52.806
And then we have to use him
to bring back men!

29:54.876 --> 29:57.381
Right. What good is
an Alaskan wilderness

29:57.414 --> 30:00.855
full of oil if you don't
sink a couple of wells?

30:00.888 --> 30:02.926
We're gonna get proof.

30:02.959 --> 30:06.432
And then we're gonna
back her up against a wall.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.303
And she's gonna be
forced to resign,

30:08.336 --> 30:09.906
and then she's gonna
lead us to him.

30:09.940 --> 30:13.848
That's the only way.
And then all this pain

30:13.881 --> 30:16.587
and suffering
will finally be over.

30:16.620 --> 30:20.293
And we'll be
a nation of mothers again.

30:27.676 --> 30:29.345
Mmm.

30:29.378 --> 30:32.484
‐How'd you get out of New York?
‐I walked.

30:33.654 --> 30:35.257
It's hard to remember, honestly.

30:35.290 --> 30:36.492
You were in shock.

30:36.527 --> 30:39.766
People treat it
like it's a hurricane,

30:39.800 --> 30:42.505
a tsunami or something, but...

30:42.539 --> 30:45.878
I don't know,
to me it feels like a person.

30:45.912 --> 30:49.485
Nature's indiscriminate.
This had intent.

30:51.389 --> 30:52.759
Do you know anything?

30:52.792 --> 30:54.261
Is there anything to know?

30:54.295 --> 30:55.631
God, I would love
someone to blame.

31:01.476 --> 31:03.246
He asked me to marry him.

31:05.417 --> 31:06.720
He told me he was going to.

31:06.754 --> 31:09.325
‐I was so happy he...
‐I said no.

31:10.528 --> 31:13.433
‐Oh.
‐I love him,

31:13.466 --> 31:15.237
it just...

31:15.270 --> 31:16.940
it felt crazy to me.

31:16.974 --> 31:19.513
We're so young
and I was leaving town,

31:19.546 --> 31:21.784
and I didn't think...

31:21.817 --> 31:24.321
We had a fight and I left.

31:24.355 --> 31:27.662
And he was alone that morning.

31:27.695 --> 31:30.735
I should have said yes.
If I had known that...

31:30.768 --> 31:32.471
Hey. No, no, no.

31:32.505 --> 31:34.308
Don't do that.

31:35.745 --> 31:37.481
He shouldn't have been alone.

31:37.515 --> 31:40.487
Did you ever find him?

31:40.521 --> 31:42.659
Our apartment. Did anyone...

31:45.565 --> 31:48.269
License. Like everyone else.

31:49.438 --> 31:51.242
Right.

31:54.315 --> 31:56.887
‐Yeah?
‐Madam President,

31:56.920 --> 31:58.691
they're asking for you
in the War Room.

31:58.724 --> 31:59.926
Can it wait?

32:01.997 --> 32:05.437
Can I come with you?
I'll stay out of the way.

32:07.007 --> 32:08.811
She's here.

32:10.915 --> 32:13.721
CDC got word
from a Greek scientist.

32:13.754 --> 32:16.025
They're seeing a new strain
of influenza B.

32:16.058 --> 32:17.161
Okay. Where's Andrea?

32:17.194 --> 32:19.031
Let's find out how many vaccines
we have left in storage.

32:19.064 --> 32:21.035
‐Yes, ma'am.
‐The flu?

32:21.068 --> 32:22.438
Yeah, well, nobody's flying;

32:22.471 --> 32:24.543
we probably won't
get hit with it.

32:25.678 --> 32:28.049
I'll just be a minute, yeah?

32:28.082 --> 32:30.822
Stay with her.
She doesn't know.

32:34.495 --> 32:35.898
Hey.

32:36.934 --> 32:39.506
Do all these people live here?

32:39.539 --> 32:43.346
Yeah. We turned some of
the bullpens into dorms.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.518
How does everybody stay so calm?

32:45.551 --> 32:47.722
Doesn't it get to you?

32:49.759 --> 32:52.532
It does, but there's
not a lot of downtime.

32:52.565 --> 32:54.503
Always a problem to solve.

32:54.536 --> 32:56.740
All those people at the gate,
it must be scary.

32:56.773 --> 32:59.613
I try not to think about it.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.351
Secret Service is at
a quarter capacity.

33:02.384 --> 33:04.823
Some of these women
are brand‐new.

33:04.856 --> 33:06.793
We had to barricade
the subway entrance...

33:06.827 --> 33:08.631
Could somebody get in?

33:08.664 --> 33:11.637
No, of course not.
It's the Pentagon.

33:13.106 --> 33:15.978
It's better
not to think about it.

33:16.012 --> 33:17.549
Is that...?

33:20.086 --> 33:22.926
You made me think I was crazy.

33:24.061 --> 33:26.465
Stay here.

33:32.946 --> 33:35.718
Let's take this someplace
a little more private.

33:35.751 --> 33:38.056
Why you?

33:40.460 --> 33:42.030
You weren't even a good mother.

33:43.499 --> 33:46.005
It should have been Ted.

33:46.038 --> 33:49.646
Or my son, or my grandbabies!

33:50.715 --> 33:53.086
Don't touch me!

33:53.119 --> 33:54.923
Come on, ma'am,
let's get you back.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.799
Marla...

34:00.968 --> 34:03.106
Yeah, yeah.

34:03.139 --> 34:05.511
I'm leaving.

34:13.994 --> 34:17.835
Let's be respectful.
Let's get back to it.

34:29.158 --> 34:30.728
Can you even fight?

34:35.538 --> 34:38.944
Look, whatever you're planning,
just don't be an idiot.

34:41.650 --> 34:43.486
Look, even if it works,
we won't get far.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.889
You're fucked‐up,
you got a cracked skull...

34:44.923 --> 34:46.593
‐I'm fine.
‐You're not fine.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.129
If I hadn't saved your ass,
you would have

34:48.162 --> 34:49.633
starved to death in New York,
writing fucking love letters

34:49.666 --> 34:51.637
‐to your girlfriend.
‐Hey, you know what?

34:51.670 --> 34:53.907
You can sit there
and wait till they kill us,

34:53.941 --> 34:55.845
but I'm gonna do something.

34:57.548 --> 34:58.884
Okay.

34:59.986 --> 35:02.224
Okay.

35:02.257 --> 35:03.794
Come on.

35:03.827 --> 35:04.863
Get up.

35:05.798 --> 35:08.904
‐Ignore him.
‐If you're fine, yeah, prove it.

35:08.938 --> 35:10.908
Right?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.879
No, yeah, you start a fight
you can't win,

35:12.912 --> 35:15.718
you're gonna make things a hell
of a lot worse for us. Okay?

35:19.859 --> 35:22.999
You're about to get your ass
beat with a fucking shoelace.

35:25.671 --> 35:27.909
‐Give me this thing‐‐ Ow.

35:27.942 --> 35:29.612
Hey, stop this shit.

35:41.937 --> 35:43.741
Okay.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.182
Okay. Yeah.

35:50.821 --> 35:53.594
Okay, just watch yourself.

35:53.627 --> 35:55.564
Hey, hey, no!

35:55.598 --> 35:56.733
‐Stop, stop, stop.
‐Hey, stop it!

35:56.767 --> 35:57.869
‐You win.
‐Fuck you!

35:57.902 --> 36:00.206
Fuck.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.210
Fuck, dude!

36:04.314 --> 36:07.555
‐Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

36:07.588 --> 36:09.659
Are you okay?

36:09.693 --> 36:11.663
Oh, shit. Uh, uh, just...

36:11.697 --> 36:13.199
‐Shit, I'm sorry.

36:13.232 --> 36:14.703
Oh...

36:14.736 --> 36:17.742
‐I didn't...

36:17.775 --> 36:20.180
‐S‐Sorry...
‐Don't touch me.

36:22.184 --> 36:24.723
‐Don't touch me.
‐Fuck. I don't...

36:24.756 --> 36:27.829
‐Oh, shit. Uh...

36:27.862 --> 36:29.231
‐Give her,
give her the shoelace.
‐Take it, take it.

36:29.264 --> 36:31.636
T‐Take it, take it,
take it, take it.

36:31.670 --> 36:33.974
‐Put it away.

36:37.147 --> 36:38.717
Who puked?

36:40.888 --> 36:42.859
She's sick.

36:42.892 --> 36:45.096
‐Concussion maybe.
‐We talked it out.

36:45.130 --> 36:48.937
You can stay till she recovers.
In town.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.983
‐And if we'd rather go?
‐I'll drive you out of town.

36:55.016 --> 36:58.122
You can walk from there.
It's a hike, but it's your call.

36:59.224 --> 37:00.828
There's a doctor here.

37:02.197 --> 37:04.736
No, we'll stay.

37:04.769 --> 37:06.272
Of course we'll stay.
Thank you.

37:06.305 --> 37:07.742
Why help us?

37:07.775 --> 37:09.344
‐What's in it for you?
‐I don't know,

37:09.378 --> 37:11.282
maybe hell isn't other people.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.286
The doc will check on you
in the morning.

37:13.319 --> 37:14.789
Can you walk?

37:20.801 --> 37:22.304
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:22.337 --> 37:24.876
‐Don't touch me.
‐Fine, fine.

37:30.053 --> 37:31.757
Out of nowhere, you just,

37:31.790 --> 37:33.694
just go and run out
into the War Room?

37:33.727 --> 37:35.965
I mean, do you know what people
are saying about you?

37:35.998 --> 37:37.769
I have to get out of here.

37:39.806 --> 37:42.612
You have to control yourself.

37:43.747 --> 37:45.083
You think you're the only one?

37:45.116 --> 37:48.055
I want to scream
every time I see her.

37:48.089 --> 37:50.160
Kimmy.

37:50.193 --> 37:52.865
Kimmy, let's go home.

37:54.669 --> 37:56.706
We'll pick the apples
off Daddy's trees.

37:56.740 --> 37:57.775
We'll live off the land.

37:57.809 --> 37:58.977
We'll be pioneer women.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.215
No, Mama, Lynchburg?

38:01.248 --> 38:02.985
No, it's gone.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.356
The house, Daddy's trees‐‐
all of it, it's gone.

38:05.390 --> 38:08.931
The‐the dam burst.

38:08.964 --> 38:10.801
No one was there to fix it.

38:10.835 --> 38:14.241
The whole town
is under debris and mud.

38:15.276 --> 38:17.648
I thought someone told you.

38:18.984 --> 38:20.186
Who would tell me?

38:23.694 --> 38:26.031
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.751
Listen. Listen to me, okay?

38:35.784 --> 38:38.957
We have work to do.
There's hope now.

38:38.991 --> 38:40.694
Yorick Brown.

38:40.728 --> 38:44.168
God has a plan for him,
for all of us.

38:44.201 --> 38:47.174
There is no God, Kimmy.

38:47.207 --> 38:50.113
‐What more proof do you need?
‐You're wrong.

38:50.146 --> 38:53.252
I‐I promise you're wrong.

38:53.286 --> 38:55.858
I just want to go home.

38:55.891 --> 38:57.995
Hey.

38:58.029 --> 39:01.736
You are home.

39:08.149 --> 39:10.386
Pray with me.
Pray with me, okay?

39:10.420 --> 39:12.424
Pray with me.

39:12.457 --> 39:17.133
Jesus Christ,
please send us strength.

39:17.167 --> 39:21.943
Help us understand why you have
brought us here in your name.

39:21.977 --> 39:24.414
Keep your son Yorick safe.

39:24.448 --> 39:28.790
May he walk the earth in steps
of purpose and grace.

39:30.093 --> 39:31.228
Amen.

39:43.052 --> 39:45.056
Was I in there for too long?

39:45.089 --> 39:46.893
I haven't had
a real shower in...

39:46.927 --> 39:48.797
Of course not.
I'll have Christine

39:48.830 --> 39:51.068
bring up some clean clothes.

39:51.101 --> 39:54.207
The first lady...

39:54.241 --> 39:55.844
Yeah?

39:55.878 --> 39:57.013
She's been through an awful lot.

39:57.047 --> 40:00.086
Kimberly's three boys were
with her that morning and...

40:00.119 --> 40:03.459
they were all in bed together
watching a movie, so...

40:03.492 --> 40:06.031
I thought I'd sleep out here.

40:06.065 --> 40:08.804
‐Give you the bed.
‐Oh.

40:08.837 --> 40:10.440
No. I can't stay.

40:10.473 --> 40:12.110
Oh, I thought...

40:12.143 --> 40:12.979
I just wanted to see you,

40:13.012 --> 40:16.452
and talk to somebody else
who loved him.

40:17.855 --> 40:20.460
Well, if you don't want to
sleep here, there's a dorm...

40:20.493 --> 40:21.930
No, you had to make rules.

40:21.963 --> 40:23.232
You can't let everybody in.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.403
And I'm not actually your...

40:25.436 --> 40:27.440
Well, you may as well be.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.382
I just wanted you to know
that I loved him.

40:35.858 --> 40:38.229
‐Where will you go?
‐Oh, um,

40:38.262 --> 40:39.933
I'm staying with friends.

40:39.966 --> 40:42.805
Sydney. You remember her?

40:42.838 --> 40:44.274
I don't know actually
if you ever met her,

40:44.308 --> 40:47.815
but her mom has a house
on Lake Anna,

40:47.848 --> 40:51.088
and they've got well water,
so...

40:51.121 --> 40:54.963
it's pretty nice,
all things considered.

40:56.866 --> 41:01.241
You know, your jacket lining
is thinning.

41:01.275 --> 41:03.379
I thought you might
like this one.

41:03.412 --> 41:05.216
It's much warmer.

41:06.553 --> 41:09.959
‐Oh, no, I can't take that.
‐I hardly wear it. It's yours.

41:09.993 --> 41:12.330
I can't wear this out there.

41:16.606 --> 41:19.812
Oh. Of course.

41:24.021 --> 41:28.563
Well, if you ever need anything,
you know where to find me and...

41:28.597 --> 41:31.536
‐I'm not going anywhere.
‐Thanks.

41:31.569 --> 41:33.105
Mm.

41:48.302 --> 41:51.342
There you go. Nice and easy.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.412
‐You want this up?
Up a little bit?
‐Yeah.

41:53.446 --> 41:56.285
Here. Okay, just one second.

41:56.318 --> 41:58.890
‐You got it.

41:58.924 --> 42:00.293
‐Is that okay?
‐Uh‐huh.

42:00.326 --> 42:01.563
Okay.

42:01.596 --> 42:04.334
Hey. Do me a favor.

42:06.305 --> 42:09.444
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

42:09.478 --> 42:12.417
Keep your mouth shut.

42:14.555 --> 42:16.559
Don't trust anybody.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.431
Okay.

42:19.464 --> 42:22.237
Especially that girl.

42:22.270 --> 42:24.575
‐What girl?
‐You know what girl.

42:24.609 --> 42:28.115
Just... just rest, okay?

42:28.149 --> 42:30.854
You won't have to do this again.

42:35.463 --> 42:38.302
You won't have to take care
of me like this again,

42:38.335 --> 42:40.239
‐I promise.
‐Hey.

42:41.475 --> 42:43.446
It's okay.

42:45.450 --> 42:46.553
I know.

43:11.736 --> 43:15.376
‐Yeah, so, I was hoping I could
get some more of that stuff.
‐Yeah, yeah, cool.

43:15.409 --> 43:17.515
You coming?

43:17.548 --> 43:20.386
Oh, my God, she's gotten
so good at that.

43:20.419 --> 43:23.225
‐Right? I know.
‐Yeah, she's been
practicing forever.

43:23.259 --> 43:25.096
Although, you know what,

43:25.129 --> 43:27.066
I think, I think
I'm gonna join her...

43:27.100 --> 43:29.337
Oh, no! Oh, my God...

44:17.300 --> 44:19.639
‐Hey.
‐Hi.

44:19.672 --> 44:21.041
Grab some grub.

44:21.074 --> 44:23.212
‐Uh, just here?
‐Mm‐hmm.

44:37.273 --> 44:40.046
‐Thank you. Mm‐hmm.
‐Hey.

44:40.079 --> 44:42.450
‐Oh, hey. Hi.
‐Hey.

44:42.483 --> 44:43.720
Not bad, right?

44:43.753 --> 44:46.158
‐Yeah. I mean...

44:49.231 --> 44:52.303
So, um, you really
an escape artist?

44:52.337 --> 44:54.174
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

44:55.376 --> 44:58.282
Couldn't get out of that cell.

44:58.315 --> 45:01.288
I think with enough time,
maybe, I, um...

45:02.658 --> 45:05.731
But no, no, not really.
That's a fricking prison cell.

45:05.764 --> 45:07.433
‐Um...

45:07.467 --> 45:10.707
‐Aw, it's okay.
‐No, it's, uh...

45:10.741 --> 45:12.578
Yeah, it's like, um,

45:12.611 --> 45:15.617
it's like Houdini stuff‐‐
so handcuffs and straitjackets

45:15.651 --> 45:17.621
‐and water tanks...
‐Oh, is there money in that?

45:17.655 --> 45:19.491
Uh, not so far.

45:21.461 --> 45:24.100
What's with the monkey?

45:24.134 --> 45:26.806
He's my best friend.

45:27.808 --> 45:30.747
This is ama‐‐ Who‐who made this?

45:30.781 --> 45:33.485
Uh, Janis made it.
She's a good cook.

45:35.356 --> 45:38.462
She's good at a lot of things,
actually.

45:38.495 --> 45:40.499
Mm.

45:46.813 --> 45:51.221
‐How did she end up, uh...
‐In prison?

46:00.540 --> 46:02.711
She stabbed two people to death.

46:03.713 --> 46:07.353
In 1978.
She was 21, strung out.

46:07.387 --> 46:09.692
Guys she did it with
got executed in the '90s.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.261
Holy shit.

46:11.295 --> 46:15.269
She's harmless.
She reads Angela Davis and shit.

46:15.303 --> 46:17.373
Don't worry about Janis.

46:20.179 --> 46:22.551
Um...

46:22.584 --> 46:24.555
Thanks for letting us stay.

46:24.588 --> 46:27.828
Well, we voted, so...

46:27.861 --> 46:31.501
‐How was our margin of victory?
‐Not great.

46:31.536 --> 46:33.807
Okay. Good to know.

46:33.840 --> 46:36.579
That's, uh‐‐ we'll, um...

46:36.612 --> 46:39.284
I will stay out of the way.

46:47.735 --> 46:49.772
Should've let 'em bleed out
on the side of the road.

46:49.805 --> 46:51.375
Very charitable, Dom.

46:51.408 --> 46:53.412
You're a real fucking
ray of sunshine.

46:53.445 --> 46:55.383
Somebody's chasing them.

46:55.416 --> 46:57.655
And if they are,
they're looking for him.

46:57.688 --> 46:59.592
Yeah? Think they might
have a few questions

46:59.625 --> 47:01.696
when they get here?
"What happened to the guards?

47:01.729 --> 47:03.533
Where are all the people
that used to live here?"

47:05.336 --> 47:06.673
We tell them the truth.

47:06.706 --> 47:09.477
Yeah? When's the fucking truth
worked out for you?

47:09.512 --> 47:11.749
Shit, Janis, now you sound
fucking stupid.

47:13.620 --> 47:15.791
What did you say to me,
little girl?

47:17.628 --> 47:19.464
That right there?

47:19.497 --> 47:22.838
That's gonna get us all killed.
Tell her not to get attached.

47:28.717 --> 47:30.286
What's that?

47:30.319 --> 47:34.361
Uh, lights out at00.
Gotta preserve what we have.

47:34.394 --> 47:35.697
Mm.

48:37.588 --> 48:40.560
Mama? I got peaches.

48:42.330 --> 48:44.501
I traded Elaine for them.

48:44.535 --> 48:47.440
She's got, like, a whole
supermarket down there.

48:47.473 --> 48:50.947
It's crazy. I don't know where
she gets the hookup from.

48:50.981 --> 48:53.520
It's pretty great.
Now all we need is

48:53.553 --> 48:59.297
some butter and I think
we are halfway to a cobbler.

48:59.330 --> 49:02.571
I think we deserve
something sweet, don't you?

49:02.604 --> 49:06.278
Mama?

49:24.748 --> 49:26.652
Mom?

49:38.475 --> 49:42.350
No!

49:42.383 --> 49:46.091
No!

49:46.124 --> 49:48.997
Mom!

50:17.688 --> 50:20.527
I wasn't sure if you'd be here.

50:20.560 --> 50:21.929
I said I would be.

50:21.963 --> 50:25.670
So, you saw her?
They let you in?

50:25.704 --> 50:27.741
Yeah.

50:27.774 --> 50:30.614
What's it like in there?

50:30.647 --> 50:34.655
Warm water, food, power.

50:34.688 --> 50:37.393
It's a time machine.

50:37.426 --> 50:40.499
But it could all fall apart.

50:40.534 --> 50:42.470
And it wouldn't take much.

50:47.781 --> 50:49.652
‐Let's go!

50:49.685 --> 50:52.724
Everyone's waiting.
