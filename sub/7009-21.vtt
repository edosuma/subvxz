13:32.645 --> 13:34.103
OH, COME ON.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.898
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
A LITTLE ACTION HERE.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.734
DONNA, I JUST CAN'T.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.320
COME ON. ALL THE OTHER GUYS
ARE DOING IT.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.617
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.410
ARE YOU, LIKE,
MAD AT ME OR SOMETHING?

13:49.578 --> 13:51.830
IT'S JUST...

13:52.289 --> 13:53.998
DONNA, I SAW
MY PARENTS HAVING SEX.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.667
OH GOD!

13:55.835 --> 13:58.086
OH, YEE!

14:01.382 --> 14:03.925
YEAH.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.011
AND YOU LIKED IT, RIGHT?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.013
NO! GOD, NO!
THAT'S SICK!

14:09.181 --> 14:10.765
EVERYONE'S SICK!

14:10.933 --> 14:12.016
I'M KIDDING.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.643
ERIC, I'M KIDDING.

14:13.811 --> 14:17.605
OH, GOOD ONE.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.942
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

14:21.110 --> 14:22.026
I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING

14:22.194 --> 14:24.279
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ELSE.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.615
ALL RIGHT?

14:27.783 --> 14:30.660
WHEN I WAS 12,
I SAW MY PARENTS DOING IT.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.038
HOW DID YOU
GET OVER IT?

14:34.206 --> 14:37.584
WELL, AT FIRST, I WAS, LIKE,
COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT.

14:37.751 --> 14:41.546
BUT THEN EVENTUALLY
THE PAIN RECEDED,

14:41.714 --> 14:44.924
AND I WAS ABLE TO LIVE AGAIN.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.718
DONNA, I DON'T
SEE THIS RECEDING.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.303
I MEAN, I WALKED IN
ON RED AND KITTY,

14:48.470 --> 14:49.554
AND THEY WERE...

14:49.722 --> 14:51.931
THEY WERE RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.100
OH, GOD.
THAT'S NOTHING.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.228
I CAUGHT MY PARENTS OUTSIDE,
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT,

14:57.396 --> 15:00.189
ON THE HAMMOCK.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.484
WHERE I USED TO READ, LIKE,
MY NANCY DREW MYSTERIES.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.239
OH, MAN, THAT IS SO MUCH
WORSE THAN MINE.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.619
I CAN REMEMBER, LIKE,
LITTLE BITS OF NAKED SKIN

15:12.786 --> 15:16.539
PEEKING THOUGH THE HOLES
OF THE HAMMOCK.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.959
WOW.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.463
IT'S WEIRD, BUT KNOWING
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH

15:23.631 --> 15:26.841
JUST MAKES ME FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.719
BECAUSE YOU'RE, LIKE,
TOTALLY OVER IT, RIGHT?

15:29.887 --> 15:35.099
AND LATER THEY CAME INSIDE,
AND THEY HAD, LIKE,

15:35.267 --> 15:40.063
THIS CHECKERBOARD PATTERN
ALL OVER THEIR ARMS AND LEGS!

15:40.230 --> 15:43.691
AND MY DAD LAUGHED
AND SAID THEY FELL ASLEEP

15:43.859 --> 15:48.237
ON THE HAMMOCK,
BUT I KNEW IT WAS A LIE.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.283
I KNEW WHAT HE DID
TO MY MOM.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.583
YOUR MOM.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.797
OKAY, I'M READY
TO FOOL AROUND.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.924
PLEASE TAKE ME HOME.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.269
OH HEY, LOOK, JACKIE.
IT'S MY FRIENDS,

16:20.437 --> 16:23.064
ERIC, DONNA, AND FEZ.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.859
YEP, THAT'S ALL
MY FRIENDS.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.779
KELSO, IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME,

16:29.947 --> 16:31.322
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?

16:31.490 --> 16:35.743
OH, NO.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.538
I THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME,

16:38.706 --> 16:40.248
AND I'M GOING TO BE
RIGHT OVER HERE

16:40.416 --> 16:42.750
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.674
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
THIS IS STUPID.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.259
JUST APOLOGIZE ALREADY.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.011
FORMAN, ITS NOT MY FAULT.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.262
WHATEVER.
HE THINKS IT IS.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.513
IT IS!

16:55.681 --> 16:57.932
YOU MADE ME FALL OFF
THE WATER TOWER.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.020
HOW?
DID I PUSH YOU?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.604
WELL, NO, BUT...

17:03.772 --> 17:06.691
DID I MAKE
THE RAILING SLIPPERY?

17:06.859 --> 17:07.859
NO.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.569
THEN HOW IS IT MY FAULT?

17:09.737 --> 17:12.405
BECAUSE!

17:12.573 --> 17:15.533
YOU DIDN'T LIKE
MY ARTWORK.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.913
AND YOU DON'T RESPECT ME
AND YOU LAUGH AT ME

17:21.081 --> 17:25.918
AND YOU'RE INCONSIDERATE
OF MY FEELINGS.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.965
KELSO, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU SOUND LIKE A CHICK.

17:32.926 --> 17:37.096
WELL...
MAN, I DO!

17:39.099 --> 17:41.142
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.770
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN
I WAS CLIMBING YOUR FENCE

17:43.937 --> 17:46.105
AND I HIT MY FOREHEAD
ON THAT TREE BRANCH,

17:46.273 --> 17:48.191
AND I FELL INTO YOUR
YARD AND YOUR DOG YOGI

17:48.358 --> 17:52.028
CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE
AND BIT ME TWICE ON THE ASS?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.951
YEAH.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.662
YOU BLED AND YOU CRIED.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.583
I BLED.
I DIDN'T CRY.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.794
YEAH, YOU DID.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.588
YOU BLED AND YOU CRIED.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.465
AND YOU LAUGHED,
MAN, A LOT,

18:12.633 --> 18:15.218
WHILE I WAS BLEEDING.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.636
DO YOU SEE MY POINT?

18:16.804 --> 18:20.056
YEAH. IT'S FUNNY
WHEN FRIENDS GET HURT.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.815

18:29.942 --> 18:31.192
SORRY.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.903

18:49.294 --> 18:51.921

VERY STRANGE LATELY.

18:52.089 --> 18:56.175
