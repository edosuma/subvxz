TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF, RODNEY.
I'M NOT DOING THIS ALONE.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.100
WHO'S BASICALLY
THE VERMEER OF STREET ART.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.033

12:25.066 --> 12:27.233
- THEY HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
ART INSTALLATIONS THERE.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.567
- IT FELT REALLY GOOD
TO PUT THAT DRUM BACK ON, RIGHT?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.533
JUST KIND OF FORGET
ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF?

12:31.567 --> 12:34.066

I NEVER STOPPED DRUMMING.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.367
- AND IS THAT YOU DO FOR WORK?

12:35.367 --> 12:37.467
- NO, I WAS TEACHING
PUBLIC-SCHOOL MUSIC FOR A WHILE,

12:37.500 --> 12:38.667
BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.367
SO I STARTED TUTORING KIDS
AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL,

12:40.367 --> 12:42.066
AND GUESS WHAT.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.266
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER.

IT WAS SO HOPEFUL.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.367
