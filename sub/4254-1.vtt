03:23.060 --> 03:26.590
The stage is cluttered with
wooden tables and chairs.

03:27.430 --> 03:29.500
Two women enter on the scene...

03:29.720 --> 03:34.290
...dressed in slips, eyes closed,
like two sleepwalkers.

03:35.350 --> 03:38.460
You're afraid the poor things are
going to bump into everything!

03:40.560 --> 03:43.470
Then suddenly we see a man...

03:44.510 --> 03:45.750
...with a very sad face...

03:46.600 --> 03:49.710
...the saddest face
I've ever set eyes on...

03:49.930 --> 03:53.460
...and he whisks the chairs
out from their paths.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.840
You can't imagine
how moving it was!

03:59.720 --> 04:03.000
A man in his 40s was
sitting next to me...

04:03.180 --> 04:04.720
...a handsome guy...

04:04.890 --> 04:08.250
...it brought him to tears
more than once.

04:08.470 --> 04:12.000
No surprise.
It was beautiful!

04:14.510 --> 04:16.390
I brought you something!

04:24.720 --> 04:28.460
I went backstage and got
Pina Bausch's autograph.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.560
I had to buy the picture.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.140
It's in English.

04:35.350 --> 04:38.880
It says:
"Overcome your obstacles...

04:39.100 --> 04:42.010
...and dance again!"

05:08.060 --> 05:10.500
- She has her period.
- It's early this month.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.420
Yes.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.170
Hello.

06:29.930 --> 06:32.630
Would you mind doing
the night shift?

06:32.850 --> 06:37.000
I can't leave the kids with
my sister, so I'm stuck.

06:37.220 --> 06:40.560
Why did you come in?
You could have just called.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.880
Am I pushing things? You've
stayed three nights this week.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.840
Don't worry. All I need
is one afternoon free.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.590
I need to talk to the contractor
about the work in my apartment...

06:51.810 --> 06:53.260
...which is a mess.

06:53.470 --> 06:56.170
Then I have to get a picture
framed and that's it.

06:56.390 --> 06:58.460
My situation is not
going to improve.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.600
We could ask the clinic administrators
and see what they say.

07:01.810 --> 07:05.340
It's not your fault your husband
left you with three kids.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.840
Do the night shifts you can,
and I'll cover the rest.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.510
We'll manage between us.

07:10.970 --> 07:12.210
Thanks a lot.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.000
You took her off the enteric IV.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.680
She couldn't handle it.

07:18.890 --> 07:22.420
- We'll give it to her tomorrow.
- You go now.

07:23.260 --> 07:24.500
And chin up!

07:32.430 --> 07:34.500
Six bulls and one woman!

07:34.720 --> 07:37.000
Next Wednesday, in Brihuega...

07:37.220 --> 07:41.170
...Lydia González will face off
against six bulls.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.290
Now, that's a lot of bulls!
Good evening, Lydia.

07:43.470 --> 07:44.540
Good evening.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.790
Why such a dramatic choice?

07:47.010 --> 07:50.540
I'm a bullfighter. I'll fight
two bulls or six... Whatever I need to.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.250
Lots of bullfighters
refuse to fight with you...

07:53.470 --> 07:55.750
...just because you're a woman.

07:55.970 --> 07:59.500
They can say whatever
they want. Each to his own.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.890
You've got to admit, bullfighting
is a macho world.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.380
With exceptions, of course.
Because the Valencia Kid...

08:06.600 --> 08:09.710
...happily shared the bill with you
for several months.

08:09.930 --> 08:11.170
That's over now.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.500
Do you think it was
just for self-promotion...

08:14.720 --> 08:16.600
...and then he dropped you?

08:16.810 --> 08:19.720
I told you I wouldn't talk about this.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.420
Hey, it's good to talk.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.380
Talking is the first step towards
resolving a problem.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.090
- The Valencia Kid...
- That's enough!

08:29.310 --> 08:32.220
Don't be rude,
let me finish my question.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.890
The Valencia Kid...

08:34.100 --> 08:37.429
I told you before the show
I wouldn't talk about this.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.919
You didn't say
anything of the kind.

08:40.140 --> 08:44.710
And don't claim that because it
will look like this was scripted.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.810
I don't go by scripts.

08:47.010 --> 08:50.130
I'm one of the few
brave enough to go live.

08:50.350 --> 08:53.880
And you should be
brave enough to admit...

08:54.100 --> 08:57.630
...the Valencia Kid
has taken you for a ride.

08:57.850 --> 08:59.720
A guy who shared not only...

08:59.930 --> 09:02.420
...fame and the bullring with you,
but also your bed...

09:02.640 --> 09:05.810
...and dropped you cold
when it suited him.

09:06.010 --> 09:09.100
Hello, Juan Luis.
This is Marco. How are you?

09:10.350 --> 09:12.420
I'd like to ask you something.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.970
I want to do a story
on Lydia González.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.920
I'm watching it too.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.500
I'd like to do something in depth.

09:27.430 --> 09:30.960
For the Sunday supplement.
Great.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.470
Bull!

10:26.810 --> 10:28.710
That woman's out of her mind!

10:28.890 --> 10:30.760
It's all for you.

10:31.390 --> 10:35.340
She'd let a bull tear her innards out
just to get your attention.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.890
We shouldn't have come.
Least of all you.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.350
The Kid doesn't have time...

11:35.560 --> 11:36.590
...for problems.

11:36.810 --> 11:39.590
I'm not going
to give him problems.

11:39.810 --> 11:44.430
Tell him to come pick up his things,
or tell me where to send them.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.960
Send them to my house.

11:46.180 --> 11:49.510
It's between him and me.
You have nothing to do with this.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.310
You're off duty now.

11:55.350 --> 11:56.380
Good evening.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.340
- A Scotch on the rocks.
- Short or tall?

12:00.560 --> 12:01.590
Tall, please.

12:05.140 --> 12:08.670
Excuse me. Could I have
a quick word with you?

12:13.890 --> 12:14.920
Excuse me.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.840
What did you say?

12:18.060 --> 12:20.540
I wondered if I could have
a quick word with you.

12:23.470 --> 12:27.000
If you give me a ride to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

12:27.220 --> 12:31.170
- I'd be happy to.
- Let's go, then.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.010
- Who chose the name Lydia?
- My father.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.590
LYDIA AND MARCO

12:45.760 --> 12:48.460
That certainly set your destiny.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.460
He wanted to be a bullfighter
but was just a banderillero.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.210
He was always behind me...

12:58.890 --> 13:01.380
...but he died a year ago.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.880
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:05.140 --> 13:06.790
El País commissioned me...

13:07.010 --> 13:08.500
...to write a story on you.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.790
Do you write about bullfighting?
Your name doesn't ring a bell.

13:12.010 --> 13:14.930
The truth is I don't
know a thing about bullfighting.

13:15.140 --> 13:16.790
Then what are you doing here?

13:17.010 --> 13:20.540
I know nothing about bullfighting
but lots about desperate women.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.680
Oh? Who said I was desperate?

13:25.140 --> 13:26.600
I just got that impression.

13:26.810 --> 13:29.290
So it's not about bullfighting.

13:29.510 --> 13:32.850
You just care about my
relationship with the Valencia Kid.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.340
You can tell El País
to forget it.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.000
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.430
What's wrong?

14:17.850 --> 14:21.180
Get me out of here!
There's a snake in the kitchen!

14:21.390 --> 14:24.720
- Give me the key.
- The door's open.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.000
Calm down and stay here.

16:00.970 --> 16:03.890
My purse. Thanks.

16:05.350 --> 16:10.340
Take me to a hotel.
I'm not setting foot in there again.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.540
- Which hotel?
- The Eurobullding will do.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.470
Please don't tell anyone
about the snake problem.

16:49.930 --> 16:51.390
Only my family knows.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.630
Don't worry.

16:52.850 --> 16:56.180
If there's one thing I respect
it's other peoples' phobias.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.460
After what you've done for me...

16:58.680 --> 17:01.380
...I feel a little funny
saying no to your story.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.060
Just sleep on it.

17:03.260 --> 17:06.380
Call me tomorrow and tell me
what you've decided.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.250
Thanks for everything.

17:10.349 --> 17:13.260
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:31.810 --> 17:33.260
Would you rather I stayed?

17:33.470 --> 17:35.880
I can sleep on the couch,
it wouldn't be the first time.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.100
No, I have to learn to be alone.

18:13.470 --> 18:14.670
- Hi.
- Hi, Benigno.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.710
- Hello, everyone.
- Good morning.

18:22.010 --> 18:25.540
- Are you washing her hair?
- What does it look like?

18:26.810 --> 18:29.290
- How did the night go?
- Nothing special.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.250
- Here, I'll take over.
- I'll be going now.

18:33.470 --> 18:35.750
- See you later.
- Bye, Matilde.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.380
Is it ever hot!

18:42.010 --> 18:44.000
We should cut her hair.

18:44.220 --> 18:47.220
Nice and short,
it's more comfortable.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.760
Cut it like before,
when she first got here.

18:50.970 --> 18:53.040
I don't want her to notice a
difference if she wakes up.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.380
After four years in a coma,
that would be a miracle.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.510
Well, I believe in miracles
and you should too.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.420
- And why me?
- Because you could use a miracle.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.380
One could come your way and you
wouldn't even notice.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.310
Boy, is it hot!

19:09.510 --> 19:12.210
I bought something
for perspiration...

19:12.430 --> 19:15.540
...because of the stains
on my uniform.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.100
This stops underarm perspiration
but my whole body still sweats.

19:19.310 --> 19:21.380
- What's it called?
- Perspirex.

19:29.430 --> 19:30.460
Yes.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.630
Hello, this is Marco.
Do you remember me?

19:32.850 --> 19:34.090
Of course I do.

19:34.310 --> 19:36.180
- How are you?
- Practically naked.

19:42.010 --> 19:45.350
I need to buy something to wear.
All I have is this dress.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.040
I can go pick up clothes
from your house.

19:48.260 --> 19:52.420
I don't want anything from there.
I'll get around to shopping.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.880
- Where to?
- Sybilla's.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.790
- You must think I'm crazy.
- Why?

19:57.010 --> 20:00.750
- Because I don't want to go back home.
- No. I understand.

20:01.390 --> 20:05.960
After we separated couldn't
sleep in the same bed.

20:06.390 --> 20:08.460
So I slept on the couch.

20:09.310 --> 20:13.680
I did that for over a week.
Until I bought a new bed.

20:13.890 --> 20:18.180
- So you're separated.
- I'm on my own.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.890
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

20:41.600 --> 20:44.510
Marco, after the bullfight
we need to talk.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.670
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You have. Not me.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.560
That's true.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.420
Did you read about the nuns?

21:22.640 --> 21:25.130
The ones the missionaries
raped in Africa?

21:26.180 --> 21:28.880
It was the priests, how awful!

21:29.100 --> 21:33.470
If you can't trust a missionary,
who can you trust?

21:33.680 --> 21:35.960
They used to rape the natives.

21:36.180 --> 21:40.340
But when AIDS came along they
started raping their colleagues.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.290
How horrible! And to think I put
missionaries on a pedestal!

21:44.510 --> 21:46.590
They're not all rapists!

21:46.810 --> 21:47.840
I hope not.

21:48.060 --> 21:50.130
- Some of them are pedophiles.
- What?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.840
When it comes to screwing
the sky's the limit.

21:53.060 --> 21:55.130
What a way to talk, Antonio!

21:56.390 --> 21:59.500
- How does the bullfight look?
- Good, but it's a big bull.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.640
- How big would you say?
- More than 500 kilos.

22:02.850 --> 22:05.130
Whoa!
Well, I'm off to the bar.

22:05.350 --> 22:08.040
Lydia, you're having
dinner with us.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.460
If the kids don't get to see
you, they'll be upset.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.540
Here he comes!

25:31.390 --> 25:33.260
Try to relax.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.670
Hi, how is she?

25:45.890 --> 25:49.090
- In bad shape.
- It ripped her in two.

25:49.310 --> 25:51.590
My father should be satisfied!

25:51.810 --> 25:57.000
My mother and I always said,
"Not her, not our baby"!

26:00.140 --> 26:03.250
- But she's just like him.
- Calm down, now.

26:04.930 --> 26:09.670
- What time is it?
- They've been in there for four hours.

26:12.850 --> 26:14.090
THREE WEEKS LATER

26:15.760 --> 26:21.600
- So you're off to Cordoba?
- Yes. I want to stay, but I can't.

26:21.810 --> 26:24.500
There's nothing we can do here.

26:25.140 --> 26:29.290
The bar has been closed
for three weeks and the kids...

26:29.510 --> 26:31.390
...are with the neighbors.

26:31.600 --> 26:36.590
Don't worry. If anything happens,
you can be here in two hours by train.

26:36.810 --> 26:39.920
- I sure will.
- You've got to keep the faith.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.880
Faith? I still light
candles to the saints...

26:45.350 --> 26:47.630
...but it's hard to have faith.

26:48.890 --> 26:52.220
When do you think we
can put her medals back on?

26:53.260 --> 26:59.010
Not yet. What, with her
injuries, the tracheotomy...

27:02.430 --> 27:04.310
She never took them off.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.170
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.390
- I'll get a vase.
- Thanks.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.040
I have to go
to America for 3 months.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.750
My agent says it's important.

27:47.850 --> 27:52.000
But given the situation here...

27:55.510 --> 27:57.090
...I don't want to go.

28:10.970 --> 28:13.250
Would you mind
stepping out, please?

28:23.260 --> 28:25.140
You can't smoke here.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.960
You two talked
before the bullfight?

28:31.180 --> 28:34.670
Yeah.
That is, I talked.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.810
What did you talk about?

28:37.850 --> 28:39.310
My things.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.850
Did she mention me?

28:43.680 --> 28:48.060
The truth is she hadn't
mentioned you for a long time.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.810
All that's happened
was my fault.

28:52.010 --> 28:53.670
No, it was my fault.

33:00.970 --> 33:03.670
The music really got to me.

33:07.220 --> 33:10.630
Marco, there's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

33:10.810 --> 33:15.350
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

33:15.560 --> 33:19.710
- It brought back memories.
- What memories?

33:20.760 --> 33:24.290
Years ago I had to
kill another snake.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.600
We were in Africa.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.710
She had the same phobia...

33:30.560 --> 33:32.630
...and waited outside the tent...

33:32.850 --> 33:36.460
...horrified, defenseless...

33:37.640 --> 33:39.510
...and completely nude...

33:41.600 --> 33:44.510
...because she had seen
the snake.

33:44.720 --> 33:48.460
Was it the same woman that you
slept on the couch for?

33:50.970 --> 33:55.540
- I hate that woman.
- I haven't seen her for years.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.500
Even worse. What can I do
to make you forget her?

34:00.760 --> 34:02.840
Exactly what you're doing.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.340
You were sleeping.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.040
We didn't want to wake you up.

34:39.929 --> 34:41.810
Is Dr. Vega in?

34:42.010 --> 34:43.920
He should be in his office.

34:56.139 --> 34:57.850
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.680
Rosa, close the door!
There's a draft.

35:29.510 --> 35:32.850
- She opened her eyes.
- It gives me goosebumps.

35:33.060 --> 35:35.970
- What about when they yawn?
- It freaks me out.

35:38.260 --> 35:41.380
Doctor,
I'd like a word with you.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.090
Of course.
How was your night?

35:45.140 --> 35:46.460
Coffee?

35:47.010 --> 35:52.000
Doctor, how long do you think
Lydia will be in this state?

35:52.220 --> 35:56.380
Months, years...
The rest of her life.

35:57.430 --> 35:59.090
There's no hope?

36:00.970 --> 36:04.920
As a doctor, I have to say no.
Nevertheless...

36:05.140 --> 36:06.380
Back to Life

36:07.640 --> 36:10.720
"Meryl Lazy Moon comes out
of a 15-year coma."

36:10.890 --> 36:14.090
She went into a coma after
the birth of her third child.

36:14.310 --> 36:17.420
She was in a vegetative state,
just like Lydia.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.920
In theory, unconscious for life.

36:20.140 --> 36:22.630
The fact that she woke up contradicts
everything I say from now on.

36:23.060 --> 36:25.340
That means there is hope!

36:25.560 --> 36:27.840
Scientifically speaking, no.

36:28.260 --> 36:30.670
But if you believe there is...

36:31.180 --> 36:34.670
Can she open her eyes,
or am I just imagining that?

36:34.850 --> 36:37.420
Yes, she can.
But that doesn't mean...

36:37.640 --> 36:41.380
...that she sees you or
understands what's going on.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.670
Lydia's cortex is destroyed.

36:43.890 --> 36:45.960
But her brain stem is intact.

36:46.180 --> 36:49.710
The brain stem is what
regulates body functions...

36:49.930 --> 36:54.630
...like breathing, sleepiness,
wakefulness, bowel movements.

36:54.850 --> 36:58.670
She can open her eyes,
but that's just a reflex.

36:58.890 --> 37:00.540
She can't think or feel.

37:16.180 --> 37:18.000
Come in!

37:18.890 --> 37:21.170
Hey, there.
Come in, come in!

37:23.640 --> 37:25.710
Yes, you.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.090
Hello.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.250
- My name is Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga.

37:33.890 --> 37:35.130
That's Alicia.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.040
- Is this your first night here?
- Yes.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.790
You'll get used to it.

37:45.970 --> 37:48.000
Why is she wearing those boots?

37:48.180 --> 37:51.920
To keep her feet straight
and upright.

37:52.100 --> 37:55.010
- They look like Ibizan espadrilles.
- Oh, really?

37:55.350 --> 37:57.220
I've never been to Ibiza.

37:57.430 --> 38:00.130
- I know you.
- Maybe from my writings.

38:00.350 --> 38:03.260
No, no.
It was watching Café Müller.

38:03.470 --> 38:06.170
I was sitting next to you.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.590
I didn't notice.

38:09.310 --> 38:13.290
There was a moment when
I saw tears in your eyes.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.500
That's the guy I told you about.
He cried during Café Müller.

38:21.220 --> 38:22.420
I've got to go now.

38:24.930 --> 38:27.680
Already?
We haven't had a chance to talk.

38:27.890 --> 38:30.970
- Another time.
- Will you be back this afternoon?

38:31.180 --> 38:33.060
- Yes.
- Come by and see us.

38:33.260 --> 38:37.000
I'm always here. I spend
lots of nights here too.

38:37.220 --> 38:39.100
Let me know if I can help.

38:39.310 --> 38:40.960
- Thanks.
- See you later.

38:50.970 --> 38:53.890
- Mr. Roncero.
- Good morning.

39:03.060 --> 39:07.210
- Shall I call Dr. Vega in?
- No, don't let me interrupt you.

39:21.180 --> 39:25.560
The other day,
looking through my papers...

39:27.010 --> 39:30.960
...I found a notebook with notes
from the day you came to see me.

39:31.810 --> 39:34.090
I jotted down something about...

39:34.310 --> 39:38.680
...a subject to bring up in your
next visit, which never happened.

39:38.890 --> 39:42.930
- And what was that?
- Your sexual preference.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.310
My sexual preference?

39:46.810 --> 39:49.090
Yes, your sexuality.

39:50.140 --> 39:52.750
Whether you prefer men or women.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.970
When you came to see me,
you said you were a virgin.

40:00.350 --> 40:04.500
Well, to answer your question...

40:06.600 --> 40:09.710
...I think I prefer men.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.250
Is that why you came to see me?

40:13.680 --> 40:16.380
I really don't remember now.

40:17.850 --> 40:21.180
I suppose so.
But I'm fine now.

40:21.390 --> 40:22.630
Do you have a partner?

40:23.470 --> 40:28.670
More or less. I'm not alone.
That's not an issue now.

40:29.310 --> 40:32.000
I hope my question
didn't put you off.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.460
No, no.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.850
- So her father came by?
- Yes.

40:42.010 --> 40:44.960
- He asked me if I was gay.
- No way!

40:45.140 --> 40:48.140
He asked that subtle
American-style question of...

40:48.310 --> 40:49.420
...what my preference is.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.680
- And what did you tell him?
- That I prefer men.

40:52.850 --> 40:57.560
- Is that true?
- No, silly. I lied.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.170
How could he dare ask me
if I prefer men or women?

41:01.350 --> 41:04.540
- Whose business is it?
- I always like to know.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.010
Does he ask the head nurse
if she's a lesbian?

41:07.180 --> 41:10.430
Or does he ask you if you're
into sodomy or coprophagy?

41:10.640 --> 41:13.970
No, you're right.
You don't ask those questions.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.750
I may have to travel.

41:23.970 --> 41:27.090
So maybe I can't come
to see you every week.

41:27.310 --> 41:31.460
They offered me to do
a choreography in Geneva...

41:31.680 --> 41:33.750
...which is very exciting.

41:33.970 --> 41:38.350
I have an old idea for a ballet
called Trenches.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.630
Set in World War I.

41:41.890 --> 41:45.220
Problem: It needs a lot of
male dancers.

41:45.430 --> 41:48.540
Because war is about soldiers.
Sorry.

41:49.180 --> 41:52.100
But everyone dances in Geneva.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.420
It's fabulous!
And there are girl dancers too.

41:55.640 --> 41:59.170
Because in the ballet,
when a soldier dies...

41:59.390 --> 42:03.760
...his soul, his ghost
comes out from his body.

42:03.970 --> 42:06.890
And that's a girl dancer.

42:07.930 --> 42:11.460
In a long white tutu,
like the Wilis in Giselle.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.810
But with bloodstains. Red.

42:15.010 --> 42:18.130
How beautiful!
Alicia is loving this.

42:18.350 --> 42:22.720
It's nice because
from death emerges life.

42:22.930 --> 42:26.260
From the masculine
emerges the feminine.

42:26.470 --> 42:30.220
- Right, right.
- From the earth emerges...

42:34.390 --> 42:36.460
The... beach?

42:36.680 --> 42:42.710
- No. From the earth emerges...
- Water?

42:43.560 --> 42:46.890
- No, the ethereal.
- Oh, of course.

42:47.100 --> 42:50.430
Ethereal, the impalpable,
the ghost.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.130
And I've decided on the music.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.850
A work by Penderecki.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.210
"Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima."
That's World War ll, but it's okay.

43:00.430 --> 43:03.540
Of course! And Alicia
remembers it perfectly.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.290
It's the battle music.
It's just amazing.

43:07.510 --> 43:10.210
And for the music of the dead...

43:10.430 --> 43:13.130
...I found a fabulous piece.

43:14.390 --> 43:17.090
Which I'll put on for you
right now.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.210
You'll just love it.

43:27.930 --> 43:31.460
Alicia, my
sweet potato, bye-bye.

43:32.100 --> 43:35.630
Goodbye, my sweetness.
My sweet potato.

43:35.850 --> 43:37.500
My sweetheart.

43:37.720 --> 43:39.600
My little baby.

43:40.850 --> 43:43.760
- Take care.
- You too, Katerina.

43:43.970 --> 43:47.310
You look great.
Trenches awaits you!

43:47.510 --> 43:50.210
I'll do it.
Take good care of her.

43:50.430 --> 43:51.460
Don't worry.

43:52.930 --> 43:53.960
Bye, now!

44:03.970 --> 44:06.670
Look, we'll put this
by the window.

44:06.890 --> 44:08.540
ALICIA AND BENIGNO

44:08.760 --> 44:11.220
So you will see
your friends dancing.

44:13.970 --> 44:15.430
And look at this...

44:18.140 --> 44:22.510
I love this bedroom.
I'm going to order the set.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.130
Hello!

44:29.640 --> 44:31.680
Close the door behind you.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.640
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Benigno.

44:40.850 --> 44:42.090
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

44:42.310 --> 44:43.960
Alicia, look who's here.

44:44.600 --> 44:48.130
We're just out here getting
some air, reading magazines.

44:49.810 --> 44:52.500
Who was the woman
that just left?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.010
Katerina.
Alicia's teacher.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.460
Teacher?

44:56.680 --> 45:00.630
Yeah, her dance teacher.
She's a real character!

45:00.850 --> 45:03.760
She has a dance school
near my house.

45:03.970 --> 45:08.350
Alicia was her student.
Katerina loves her like a daughter.

45:19.810 --> 45:22.100
FOUR YEARS EARLIER

45:53.140 --> 45:56.470
Benigno, you've
been there for half an hour.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.590
Coming, Mama.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.810
Are you following me?

46:50.010 --> 46:53.540
- No. Well, yes.
- Why?

46:54.390 --> 46:57.920
I think this is yours.
You must have dropped it.

46:59.810 --> 47:00.840
Thanks.

47:01.260 --> 47:03.560
- Is everything there?
- Yes.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.840
- I didn't even open it.
- Thanks.

47:06.470 --> 47:08.760
- Where are you going?
- Home.

47:08.970 --> 47:12.310
Mind if I walk you home?
I'm not busy right now.

47:12.510 --> 47:14.170
Okay, but I'm going home.

47:14.390 --> 47:16.880
Right, I know.
That's fine with me.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.970
Dancing is my whole life.

47:19.180 --> 47:21.880
I love watching dance.
Do you like dance?

47:22.100 --> 47:25.850
I guess so. Yeah, sure.
But I've never seen a performance.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.970
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

47:29.180 --> 47:33.130
I like to travel and I
go to the movies a lot.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.680
I just got into silent films.
I love them.

47:36.890 --> 47:40.420
- Silent films?
- Yeah. What do you do for fun?

47:40.640 --> 47:43.130
- Nothing. I don't go out.
- I'm sure you go out sometime.

47:43.350 --> 47:46.460
No. I used to take care
of my mother.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.970
- She died two months ago.
- I'm sorry.

47:49.180 --> 47:51.470
Mine died too.
But a while ago.

47:53.140 --> 47:56.670
Well, we're here.
Thanks for my wallet.

48:25.430 --> 48:28.540
Dr. Roncero. Psychiatrist.
7th floor.

48:32.310 --> 48:33.340
Twenty-three.

48:35.640 --> 48:38.040
I spent all day at the window...

48:38.260 --> 48:40.420
...but she didn't show up.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.560
I knew her address.
Her father was a psychiatrist.

48:53.350 --> 48:55.000
Dr. Roncero's office.

48:56.260 --> 48:58.720
I'm calling for an appointment.

48:59.390 --> 49:01.260
How about tomorrow at 5:00?

49:01.680 --> 49:05.210
- Could it be earlier?
- No. Tomorrow at 5:00.

49:05.430 --> 49:07.060
- Okay.
- Your name, please?

49:25.220 --> 49:28.970
- Can I help you?
- I have a 5:00 appointment.

49:29.180 --> 49:30.210
Come in.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.420
Come in.
In here, not there.

49:47.510 --> 49:50.630
Benigno Martín?
I'll need some information.

49:52.930 --> 49:55.220
I just wanted to
see Alicia again.

49:55.430 --> 49:57.090
He was a psychiatrist, so...

49:57.310 --> 49:59.680
...I'd tell him
I missed my mother.

49:59.930 --> 50:01.890
The last 15 years, was it?

50:02.100 --> 50:06.040
Yes. I was just a kid
when I started taking care of her.

50:06.890 --> 50:08.760
And during those 15 years...

50:08.970 --> 50:12.310
...all you did was
take care of your mother?

50:12.510 --> 50:14.590
I was always by her side.

50:14.810 --> 50:19.180
Well, I was also studying
to be a nurse.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.970
And took classes in
beautician work, makeup and hair.

50:24.180 --> 50:26.880
Those were
correspondence courses.

50:27.930 --> 50:31.260
Do you mean you did your mother's
makeup and hair?

50:31.470 --> 50:35.000
Sure. I cut and dyed her hair,
did her nails...

50:35.220 --> 50:38.340
...and sponge-bathed her,
front and back.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.510
My mother wasn't incapacitated
or crazy.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.010
She was just a little lazy.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.710
She was a pretty woman.

50:47.930 --> 50:50.630
I didn't want her
to let herself go.

50:50.850 --> 50:55.000
- What did your father say?
- Nothing. What could he say?

50:55.220 --> 50:57.290
- Is he dead?
- Heavens, no.

50:58.350 --> 51:03.140
He lives in Sweden, I think.
I haven't heard from him in ages.

51:03.350 --> 51:05.840
- He doesn't come to visit?
- No.

51:07.100 --> 51:11.470
After he and my mother divorced,
he got on with his life.

51:14.390 --> 51:16.130
We're not in touch.

51:17.310 --> 51:18.880
Why did you come to see me?

51:21.060 --> 51:23.040
- Well...
- What's bothering you?

51:23.220 --> 51:24.250
Nothing!

51:24.560 --> 51:27.920
Something's brought you
to see a psychiatrist.

51:31.890 --> 51:33.790
I guess it's loneliness.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.060
Have you ever had sex
with a woman?

51:39.560 --> 51:40.840
No.

51:42.510 --> 51:44.810
- How about with a man?
- No.

51:48.350 --> 51:50.420
Could we meet again next week?

51:50.850 --> 51:52.310
Is something wrong?

51:52.510 --> 51:54.170
No, but...

51:55.430 --> 51:58.430
...your adolescence was,
well, unusual.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.460
- Not that unusual.
- Yes, very unusual.

52:02.310 --> 52:03.540
Whatever you say.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.250
Better to analyze it in depth.

52:06.470 --> 52:08.510
Okay, we'll analyze it.

52:14.180 --> 52:17.100
- Should I come back next week?
- Yes.

52:17.930 --> 52:20.630
- Thanks, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

53:52.100 --> 53:55.210
- What are you doing here!
- I was on my way out.

53:55.430 --> 53:58.540
Don't get upset.
I just wanted to see you...

53:58.760 --> 54:00.640
...but I'm harmless.

54:17.930 --> 54:21.460
Dr. Roncero's office.
Hi, Lola!

54:22.310 --> 54:24.970
I just took the world's
biggest dump.

54:50.010 --> 54:55.210
One, two, three.
Back straight.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.210
What? An accident?

55:13.970 --> 55:16.040
Can you take over the class?

55:33.140 --> 55:35.840
Alicia never
went back to dance class.

55:36.060 --> 55:38.970
I went to her house
the following week...

55:39.180 --> 55:42.430
...as I'd agreed
with her father.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.430
It rained nonstop that week.

55:51.890 --> 55:56.040
- The next time I saw her was here.
- What happened to her?

55:56.560 --> 55:59.390
A car accident on
one of those rainy days.

56:01.680 --> 56:05.430
Her father wanted
round-the-clock care for her.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.710
He asked for names of nurses...

56:07.930 --> 56:12.720
...and I've got a good reputation
here so they recommended me.

56:13.350 --> 56:18.140
When we met he remembered
who I was and hesitated...

56:18.350 --> 56:21.680
...but ended up hiring
Matilde and me.

56:22.930 --> 56:26.460
That was four years ago,
and here we are.

56:27.310 --> 56:28.630
Right, Alicia?

56:33.560 --> 56:36.670
I started going to the ballet
on my days off.

56:36.890 --> 56:40.640
I also see as many
silent films as I can:

56:40.850 --> 56:43.960
German, American,
Italian, everything.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.470
I tell her what I've seen.

56:49.390 --> 56:54.380
These four years have been the best
in my life, taking care of Alicia...

56:54.600 --> 56:58.670
...doing what she liked doing,
except traveling, of course.

56:58.890 --> 57:01.560
Just the opposite happens to me
with Lydia.

57:02.310 --> 57:03.340
How so?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.250
I can't touch her.

57:09.390 --> 57:11.460
I don't recognize her body.

57:12.510 --> 57:16.260
I can't even help the nurses
turn her over in bed.

57:17.310 --> 57:19.380
It makes me feel mean.

57:20.430 --> 57:23.130
Talk to her.
Tell her about it.

57:23.350 --> 57:26.040
I'd like to,
but she can't hear me.

57:26.260 --> 57:27.920
How can you be so sure?

57:28.760 --> 57:31.460
Because her brain
is gone, Benigno.

57:32.510 --> 57:36.670
A woman's brain is a mystery,
And more so in this state.

57:36.890 --> 57:40.220
You have to take them
into account, talk to them...

57:40.430 --> 57:44.380
...pamper them now and then.
Caress them when they least expect it.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.930
Remember they're there,
alive and important to us.

57:48.140 --> 57:51.250
That's the best therapy.
I know from experience.

57:51.470 --> 57:54.090
What experience
do you have with women?

57:54.310 --> 57:58.350
Benigno, what experience
do you have with women?

58:01.060 --> 58:02.430
What?

58:02.930 --> 58:05.460
What experience do
you have with women?

58:05.850 --> 58:07.310
Who, me? Tons!

58:07.720 --> 58:11.060
I lived with one for 20 years,
and now four with her.

58:12.930 --> 58:16.880
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
I bet he's well-hung.

58:17.100 --> 58:19.340
How do you know?
Have you had a look?

58:19.510 --> 58:22.090
- Cookies?
- Yes.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.600
No, their faces tell all.

58:24.760 --> 58:27.250
I'd say it's their crotches.

58:28.510 --> 58:29.970
I have a sixth sense.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.560
Isn't he friends with Benigno?

58:32.810 --> 58:33.840
Yeah.

58:35.390 --> 58:37.260
Do you think he's gay too?

58:38.310 --> 58:41.840
- Are you kidding?
- Are you saying Benigno's gay?

58:42.060 --> 58:46.210
- Well, the word's out.
- You're so mistaken!

58:46.430 --> 58:49.350
- Dr. Vega told me so.
- How does he know?

58:49.560 --> 58:51.430
Alicia's father told him.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.130
He was getting
too close to the patient...

58:54.350 --> 58:58.290
...but the doctor said that
women weren't his choice.

58:58.510 --> 59:01.000
- He goes for men.
- Oh, come on!

59:01.180 --> 59:03.790
I'm leaving, you two
can keep gossiping.

59:08.310 --> 59:12.210
- Poor thing has a crush on Benigno.
- That's a good one!

59:14.760 --> 59:16.420
- Hi.
- Hi, Benigno.

59:18.510 --> 59:22.040
I'm off tonight. Going to the movies.
Want to come?

59:22.220 --> 59:26.430
I'm meeting with my editor.
I've got to get back to work soon.

59:28.100 --> 59:32.040
- She needs some attention.
- Benigno, please!

59:32.260 --> 59:33.920
Come on, listen to me.

59:34.970 --> 59:37.040
Her skin's dry, poor thing.

59:44.560 --> 59:47.670
- Have you talked to her?
- No. Don't push it.

59:53.310 --> 59:57.060
Bye, Lydia.
Just have patience with this guy.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.640
Okay, take care!

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:19.350
"Shrinking Suitor."

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.060
SHRINKING
SUITOR

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.630
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't catch it.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.510
I'm glad you're okay.
I'll give you a massage...

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.010
...and an alcohol rubdown.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.060
No, nothing's wrong.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.590
Last night I saw a movie
that really got to me.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.630
It's a love story
between Alfredo...

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.790
...he's chubby, like me,
but a nice guy...

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.170
...and his girlfriend Amparo,
a scientist.

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:39.760
She's doing research
on an experimental diet...

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.430
...totally new!

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.880
"You only think of yourself."

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:15.930
"I've got it!"

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.960
"It's risky, I haven't
tested it on humans yet."

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.420
"Do I still seem selfish?"

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.060
"That went down nicely!"

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.250
"Don't worry, darling!
I'll find the antidote!"

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.500
But time passed.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.250
Amparo couldn't come up
with the antidote.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:45.390
And poor Alfredo
steadily shrank.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.560
...my darling.
I'll always love you.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.920
To save her from suffering,
Alfredo left her and Madrid.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.840
He returned to live
with his mother.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.000
He hadn't spoken to her
in 10 years.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.680
He had never told Amparo
where she lived.

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.640
Lots of other things happen.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.380
But the important part...

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:21.840
...is that after years of
regrets and digging around...

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:27.670
...Amparo discovers where
Alfredo's mother lives...

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.040
...and shows up at the door.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.210
"Hotel Youkall.
Room 15"

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:52.170
"- Sleep, my darling.
- What if I crush you in my sleep?"

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:26.260
And Alfredo...

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:31.000
...remains inside her...

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.210
...forever.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.140
ONE MONTH LATER

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:07.260
Let's get your hands comfortable.
That's it.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.010
This fresh air feels great!

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.970
Nice to be out on the balcony,
isn't it?

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.290
Lydia's happy to be out here too.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.850
Right, Lydia?
You heard her, she loves it.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.460
Look at them. You'd think they
were chatting about us.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.560
What do you think they'd say?
They're not shy.

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:42.880
Women tell all.
Absolutely everything.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.340
She'd say she was gored
by a bull two months ago.

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.090
Benjamin and Angela...

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:32.060
...do you come to be wed
of your own volition...

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.600
- ...freely and voluntarily?
- Yes, we do.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.560
Then, wishing to contract
holy marriage...

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.640
...join hands and give...

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.510
...your consent before
God and the Church.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.260
I, Angela, take you, Benjamin...

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:55.340
...as my husband.
I will be faithful...

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.350
...and will be yours
in joy or sorrow...

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.540
...in sickness and in health,
all the days of my life.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.340
May the Lord,
the source of your love...

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.210
...consecrate this union...

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:13.500
...declared before the Church.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.470
Whom God hath joined together...

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:22.260
What are you doing here?
We planned to meet at the hotel.

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:26.630
I changed my mind.
I love weddings.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.960
Weren't you going to see
your sister?

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.880
I called her.
We'll meet at the hotel.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.210
I promised we'd eat
with them tonight.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.500
That's fine.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.670
- Nice wedding, wasn't it?
- Beautiful.

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.670
She's so young.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.180
You don't trust me.

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:59.760
Marco, I came because I need to
talk to you right away.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:03.090
Relax, it's all over with Angela.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:04.540
I can prove it.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.670
I didn't cry during the ceremony.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.960
- You're the one who cried.
- True.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.840
And you had no reason to.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.130
- Don't you trust me?
- Yes.

01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:18.500
It took me a decade to get over it.
But I swear it's over.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.290
- Marco...
- Lydia, trust me. It's over.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.060
Angela and I traveled a lot.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.210
Supposedly to write travel
guides about exotic places.

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:35.380
But actually to get her
away from drugs. Out of Madrid.

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:38.090
Life in Madrid was hell.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.710
Our relationship only
worked on the run.

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:43.930
Five years and
seven travel guides later...

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.670
...I brought her here to Lucena,
to her parents...

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:50.500
...away from drugs
and from me.

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:53.500
- Did you still love her?
- Yes.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.430
I cried whenever
something moved me...

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.340
...because I couldn't
share it with her.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.130
There's nothing worse than separating
from someone you still love.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.000
What a sad story!

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.600
Love is the saddest thing ever
when it's over...

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:12.880
...as Jobim's song says.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:16.420
Marco, we have to talk.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.930
We've been talking for an hour.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.670
- You have, not me.
- That's true.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.600
...I'm glad
I was gored by the bull.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:59.960
That way I can stay
by your side, my love.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.880
Nothing will take me
away from you.

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:08.310
We were back together.
It had been a month.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.380
She was going to tell you...

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.540
...but I figured she hadn't.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.630
So her tears were for you?

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.210
She called the restaurant to say
she'd thought of me and cried.

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:29.310
That was the last time we spoke.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:33.710
Because of the injury I won't
be fighting for a while.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.590
I'd like to stay with her.

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:38.970
Make yourself at home.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.540
Hello, Alicia.
I'm alone, once again.

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:26.680
I caught you
admiring her breasts.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.180
They're filling out by the day.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.510
Benigno, I'm planning
to take a trip.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.210
- Why's that?
- I have to get back to work.

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:39.600
- What about Lydia?
- Lydia doesn't need me.

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:47.090
- Have you split up?
- That's one way to put it.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.920
Marco, I saw it coming.
Don't ask how, but I did.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.170
There was something there
that just didn't click.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.260
When are you leaving?

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:03.540
In the next few days.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.680
I'll be sad to see you go.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.040
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hi, Marco.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.790
Well, I'm off, Benigno.
See you soon.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.880
- Bye, Rosa.
- Ciao.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.500
- Did she get her period yet?
- No.

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:26.040
I'm looking
at last month's chart...

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.060
- ...and she should have had it by now.
- Yeah, it's a little late.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.210
Two weeks. That's too much.

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:47.920
Are you sure
she got it last month?

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.010
I put on the pad myself.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.140
It was the week you had the flu.

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:55.420
She seems a little bloated.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.340
Sometimes they get off schedule.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.670
Lydia's period
disappeared altogether.

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:05.840
Yeah. But anyway
Dr. Vega should be told.

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:24.390
- Hi, Benigno.
- Hi.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.000
I brought some of my
travel guides...

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.590
- ...for Alicia and you.
- Thanks.

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:32.720
I just said goodbye to Lydia.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:36.880
Then I went to see Alicia...

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.170
...but Dr. Vega
was in her room...

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:42.310
...and I couldn't go in.
Is something wrong?

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.250
I think Alicia
might have an infection.

01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.380
Could you give me a ride home?

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.670
I hope it's nothing serious.

01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:55.420
They're doing some tests on her.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.840
They didn't want to tell
me what the problem was.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:03.340
Abidjan, Yemen,
Brazil, Turkey, Cuba.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:08.340
- I'll read them to Alicia.
- They're only travel guides.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.850
I'm sure they're a good read.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.130
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.340
I wanted to talk to you about that,
Marco, before you left.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.630
- About what?
- Loneliness.

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:24.890
- I want to get married.
- Married? To who?

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.720
To Alicia.
Who else?

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:28.960
Are you crazy?

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:32.710
We get along better
than most married couples.

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.500
What's so strange?

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.460
Because she is in a coma!

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:41.670
Alicia can't say "I do"
with any part of her body.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:44.720
Her life is just
a vegetative life!

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:46.340
Get in the car!

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.960
- How can you say that?
- Get in the car!

01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:00.210
What you have with Alicia
is a monologue and it's crazy.

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.220
We also talk to plants...

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.260
...but we don't marry them!

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:08.420
I can't believe it.
I thought you were different.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.210
Never mention
this subject again!

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.750
Nor even think about it!
Promise.

01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:17.100
- Why?
- Because you'll be in big trouble...

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.600
...and I won't be around
to help!

01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:22.290
If it makes you feel better,
I promise.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.260
- As lovable as she may be...
- You're attracted to her too?

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.960
Of course I am!
How could I not be?

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.340
- She feels the same way about you.
- She is practically dead!

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.430
She can't feel anything!

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.170
Not for you, not for me,
not even for herself!

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:48.310
Our patient has been
raped and is pregnant.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.630
Her father doesn't know yet.

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:53.540
First, I want to know
who is the SOB...

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.000
...who did that.

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.790
Sir, we all feel shocked.

01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:01.810
You should feel responsible!
Alicia is your patient.

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:05.850
Then let me be the one to
fill you in on the situation.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.250
Rosa, go ahead.

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:12.920
Alicia hadn't had her
period in two months.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.630
I thought it was just
one month late, but...

01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:18.040
...I was wrong.

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:20.840
There was no mention of it
on the chart.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.090
A sanitary pad was
applied as usual.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.000
I was out with the flu
that week.

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:33.250
You wrote that, didn't you, Benigno?
It's your handwriting.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.930
Yes, I did.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:37.810
Why did you do this?

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:41.880
I didn't want anyone
to get alarmed.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.880
Other patients
stop getting periods.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.310
That's true.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.170
But why wasn't anyone
aware of it?

01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:51.100
What about the other nurse?

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.960
Matilde?
She couldn't be here today.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.100
Didn't she notice
the first skipped period?

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.380
Matilde has family problems.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.630
- She's missed nights.
- Who covered for her?

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.060
Benigno.

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:10.630
Do you expect me
to tell Mr. Roncero...

01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:12.500
...she was in his care?

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.890
Please, let's not lose our heads.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.430
Benigno, do you realize...

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.750
...you've become
the prime suspect?

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.510
Why'd you hide that
she skipped a period?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.250
I'm sure you can explain it.
You wouldn't harm Alicia.

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:35.140
- You can be sure of that.
- So?

01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:42.500
Yesterday, in the parking lot...

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.560
...I overheard a conversation
between Benigno and Marco.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.590
Benigno said he wanted
to marry Alicia.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:53.960
Mr. Zuloaga tried
to talk him out of it, but...

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.250
...Benigno wouldn't listen.

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:58.960
He said that
many married couples...

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:02.710
...didn't get along
half as well as they did.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.380
JORDAN, EIGHT MONTHS LATER

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.170
"Lydia González was buried
yesterday, April 13th.

01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:31.460
The 33-year-old bullfighter...

01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:36.810
...daughter of Antonio González,
had been in a coma."

01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:39.810
El Bosque Clinic.

01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:42.500
May I speak to Benigno Martín?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.380
He no longer works here.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.140
To get these signed...

01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:48.140
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:51.260
- Is Rosa Lazaga there?
- Who's calling?

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:54.390
- Marco Zuloaga.
- Just a moment. I'll connect you.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.010
- Where do I get these signed?
- In the office.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.890
- This is Marco Zuloaga.
- Marco.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.210
I'm in Jordan.
I just read that Lydia died.

01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:08.540
Yes. She did.
I'm really sorry, Marco.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.250
I wish somebody
had contacted me.

01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:14.590
We've had so many problems here...

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:18.960
What's going on?
Benigno doesn't work there now?

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.970
- No. Benigno is in jail.
- In jail? What for?

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.340
He's been accused
of raping Alicia.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.840
You can't be serious!

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.920
Help him.
The poor thing has no one.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.250
- Have you seen him?
- Who, me?

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:39.180
After what he did, I just can't.

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:42.720
You've got to help him.
You're his friend.

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:46.880
- Okay. What prison is it?
- Segovia.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.600
Wait for me here, please.

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:55.850
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.930
I'd like to visit a prisoner.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.250
That's in Communications.
On your left.

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:02.500
Thank you.

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.130
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:15.420
I'd like to see a prisoner,
Benigno Martín.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.470
Sorry, I can't hear you.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.010
Today's not visitor's day.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.510
And the resident
hasn't requested any visit.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.720
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.250
- Right. Are you a relative?
- No, a friend, Marco Zuloaga.

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:42.170
- May I see an ID, please?
- Sure.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.710
- Can I call him?
- No. But he can call you.

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:51.040
I've changed my number.
Could you pass it on?

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.140
- Of course.
- Thank you.

01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:06.260
Visiting days are
Saturday and Sunday...

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:09.390
...but the resident
has to request it.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.350
If he doesn't want to,
there's nothing we can do.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.930
He'll want to see me.
Thank you.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.630
- By the way, we don't have...
- I can't hear you.

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:24.960
We don't have prisoners here,
we have residents.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.460
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:31.670
6-2-7...

01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:39.810
...9-6-6-4-0-9.

01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:43.350
No, nine, nine.

01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:49.040
6-2-7...

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.290
Yes, hello?

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:05.430
- Marco, is that you?
- Yes, Benigno.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.430
It's great to hear you!

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.250
I requested your visit
for Saturday.

01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:11.460
Yeah, okay.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.790
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:21.880
Dr. Vega filled me in.
How could you do it, Benigno?

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.210
You didn't come back
to lecture me, did you?

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:29.180
No. If you need anything,
I'll bring it on Saturday.

01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:31.880
I need information.
How's Alicia?

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.210
Nobody at the clinic
will talk to me.

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.720
They said her father moved her.

01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:39.130
I don't believe that.

01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:41.750
They won't tell us where she is.

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:45.000
Are you still my friend?

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.920
Of course.
Why else would I be here?

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.630
Then find out how Alicia is.

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:55.000
If she's alive, if she had
a girl or boy, if it's alive.

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:58.750
I have to know, Marco.
You understand, right?

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:05.220
Yes. I'll try to find out.
See you on Saturday.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.430
- Do you have news?
- Not yet.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.090
But I'll get some,
just be patient.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.840
I was until Alicia's due date.

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.210
- But that was a month ago!
- You'll have to keep waiting.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.210
- How do you spend your days?
- I work in the infirmary.

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.920
Since it's a new prison...

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.060
...it's not too bad in here.

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:40.420
- It doesn't look like a prison.
- That's not the problem.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.560
The problem is missing Alicia.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:48.750
According to the pathologist and
Alicia's father, I'm a psychopath.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:53.630
Yeah, a psychopath. They say it
works in my favor for the trial.

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:55.850
I don't care about the trial.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:00.210
I need to see Alicia and
know how things turned out.

01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:03.340
And if I don't, I swear
I'll stop at nothing.

01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:06.890
I'm a psychopath, right?
I'll behave like one.

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.970
Don't say that, Benigno.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.970
Find me another lawyer.
Mine's court-appointed.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.640
The guy hates me.

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.500
Okay, I will.

01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:20.250
The concierge
will give you my keys.

01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.310
Rent out the apartment.

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:25.210
I could take it on.
Mine's rented out.

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:28.290
I like the idea
of you as my tenant.

01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:33.960
I've thought of you often these
last months, especially at night.

01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:37.470
- Why at night?
- I read at night.

01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:41.460
I've read all the guide books
you gave me.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.210
It was like months of traveling
with you by my side.

01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:47.500
Giving me the inside story.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.640
My favorite was the
one on Havana.

01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:53.540
I could really relate
to those people...

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.840
...who don't have anything.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.210
When you describe
that Cuban woman...

01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:02.720
...leaning out a window...

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.840
...sitting there, doing nothing...

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.170
...watching time go by.

01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:12.920
I thought, that's me.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.210
Good morning.
I'm Benigno's friend.

01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:38.960
- Are you Marco, from Argentina?
- Yes.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.840
I'm the concierge.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.810
Benigno called to say
you'd be renting his place.

01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:47.310
- Right.
- You'll find it very dusty.

01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:50.850
I'm not allowed
to do the cleaning.

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.350
I wouldn't have
charged him, but...

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.210
I'll take care of that.

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:57.640
- Do you want the key?
- Yes.

01:30:57.810 --> 01:30:59.930
Let's see where it is.

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.170
- Have you seen him?
- Yes.

01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:11.880
- How is he?
- Fine.

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:16.680
Poor thing wasn't even lucky
with jail.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.600
He barely got any press!

01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:23.140
No TV reporters have come by,
not even the paparazzi.

01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:27.100
With all the junk shows on TV,
no one even bothered...

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:29.380
...coming by to interview me.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:33.540
The state of the media is really sad
in this country.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.710
Yes, I agree with you.
The key. Thanks.

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:43.130
By the way, do you know
why Benigno is in jail?

01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:48.140
He's so reserved. When I last
saw him he didn't say a word.

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:51.460
- Benigno is innocent.
- I know he's innocent.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.600
- But of what?
- I don't know.

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:58.960
Of course you do, you just
don't want to tell me.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.930
- But I'll get it out of you.
- Okay. Bye now.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.890
- If you need anything, tell me.
- Right.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:08.970
Alicia, I was thrilled to
see you come in on your own.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.670
- On your crutches!
- It's great.

01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:14.180
- How did rehab go today?
- Fine.

01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:16.460
- Are you tired?
- Yes, very.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.970
That's okay. We're going to do
a little more exercising.

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:25.840
- Some leg stretches.
- I've done 100 today.

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.750
That's good,
we'll just do a few more.

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:08.350
- I'm here to see Mr. Sanz.
- Come in.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.060
The baby was stillborn.
It was a boy.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:18.960
She's out of her coma.
Benigno should know.

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.060
I don't think so.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.340
He's capable of anything.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.140
I can't lie to him.
I'm his friend, he trusts me.

01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:30.630
I'll talk to him.
It's not a problem for me.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:34.790
I'll say Alicia is still in a coma
and that the child died.

01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:37.630
Promise me
you won't say anything.

01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:39.170
Any chances of ball?

01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:44.040
Not promising and it would be high.
But we can try.

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:10.220
- Hi, Marco.
- Hi, Benigno.

01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:13.960
- Did you get wet?
- A little.

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.930
Be sure you don't catch a cold.
When you get home...

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:21.060
...have a glass of warm milk
with honey.

01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.130
I'll do it.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.010
Now I like rainy days.

01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:38.760
Have you met the lawyer?

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.970
Yes. He came to see me.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.710
He filled me in on things.

01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:50.590
It looks bad.

01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.560
Yes.

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.840
At least Alicia's condition
hasn't changed.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:00.840
That's the one consoling factor,
and gives me hope.

01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:04.810
Are you okay, Benigno?

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.670
I'd like to give you a hug.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.710
That means asking
for special permission.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.630
I checked into it.

01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:24.790
They asked me if you were
my boyfriend.

01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:29.170
I didn't dare say yes,
in case that would upset you.

01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:34.180
It doesn't upset me at all.
Say whatever you want.

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.040
I've hardly ever hugged anyone.

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:34.380
A message?

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.250
Marco, I was happy
to see you today...

01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:43.760
...and to say goodbye to you.

01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:47.090
As you know, I only will
get out of here...

01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:48.960
...to change prisons.

01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.880
I don't want to live
without Alicia.

01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:56.040
I can't even have
her hair clip to hold onto.

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:59.670
So I've decided to take off.

01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:03.130
I didn't want you to worry
or try to stop me.

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.840
A big hug, Marco.

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:19.380
Taxi!

01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:25.850
- To Segovia.
- Segovia?

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.130
- To the prison.
- The prison?

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.250
I need to see Benigno Martín.
It's urgent.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.600
It's a case of life and death.

01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:57.500
The director is waiting for you.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.790
- Where's his office?
- This man will take you there.

01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.930
Empty your pockets, please.

01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:29.170
Wait, slow down.

01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:37.640
There.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.750
Hello, I'm Marco Zuloaga.

01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.850
Benigno left this letter for you.

01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:57.920
Dear Marco, it's still raining.

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:01.040
I think that's a good sign.

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.850
When Alicia had her accident,
it was raining too.

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:09.590
I'm writing you
just before the big move.

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:15.220
I hope I've taken enough
to put me in a coma and join her.

01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:18.540
You're my only friend.

01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:22.930
I leave you the home
I set up for Alicia.

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:29.810
Wherever they take me,
come visit and talk to me.

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:33.750
Tell me everything.
Don't hold back.

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.260
Your friend, forever.

01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:58.540
Here are the belongings
we were holding.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.840
And his personal effects.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.790
Sign here, please.

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:13.540
Sir?
You need to sign here.

01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.680
Benigno, it's me.

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:29.590
Alicia is alive.
You brought her back to life.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.500
When I heard your message
I rushed to the prison...

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.790
...but I got there too late.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.750
I've put Alicia's hair clip
in your pocket.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.060
Together with pictures of her
and of your mother...

01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:56.260
...so they'll be
with you forever.

01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:25.220
...cruel, the masculine below,
the feminine above.

01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:27.500
I'll get us some water.
Have a seat.

01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:59.590
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:03.290
I don't know.

01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:09.810
- Now I feel much better.
- What's that?

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.420
Ah, sweetheart, let's go back in.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.290
Come on!

01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:31.670
You're shaking.

01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:34.590
- No.
- Yes. Why?

01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:49.390
- What did she say to you?
- Nothing.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.290
- I saw you two talking.
- She asked me...

01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:55.000
...if I felt okay
and I thanked her.

01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:01.890
You may see me around.
I live across from your school.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.210
- In Benigno's house?
- Yes.

01:46:05.850 --> 01:46:09.600
- Why there?
- Benigno died.

01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:17.500
Some day you and I need to talk.

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:21.250
Yes, and it'll be simpler
than you think.

01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:23.970
Nothing is simple.

01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.930
I'm a ballet teacher,
and nothing is simple.
