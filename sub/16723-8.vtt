Oh, everybody, look at the tree.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.654
Aw, I love this tree.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.158
It's the day after Halloween, Lin.
Think we might have gotten the tree early?

00:33.241 --> 00:35.493
Oh, put some mistletoe on my butt
and kiss it, Bobby.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.870
-Okay.
-Yeah, Dad.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.622
Stop ruining Halloween
by not celebrating Christmas.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.877
Aw, bye, tree. You had a good life.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.047
That's how I want to go out,
dehydrated and covered in tinsel.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.008
- Sounds like a gay pride parade.
- Mm-hm.

00:50.091 --> 00:54.262
Everybody, look at the tree.
Aw, I love our new tree. Look.

00:54.346 --> 00:58.266
It's the day after Thanksgiving, Lin.
I'm not looking at it 'til tomorrow.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.435
It seems like just yesterday
it was Thanksgiving.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.353
Oh, my God.

01:03.104 --> 01:06.483
It's Christmas Eve, and our tree is dead.
What are we gonna do, Bobby?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.819
I don't know, but we have to get this out
of the house. It caught fire twice.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.405
We're just not gonna have a tree
on Christmas this year.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.576
What? No! No!
Not have a tree on Christmas?

01:16.659 --> 01:19.245
Where are the presents gonna go
if there's no tree?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.705
We want a divorce!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.624
Thank you, bye.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.378
Everyone just calm down, okay?
There is a tree lot about an hour away.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505
Guy said we could have
the pick of the runts.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.299
Lin, you wanna drive an hour away
and get another tree?

01:31.383 --> 01:34.135
What about our Christmas Eve dinner?
I have a ham in the oven.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.095
You have to fart?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.931
No, Tina.
A real ham is currently in our oven.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.850
-Just bring it. Everyone loves rare ham.
-No, Gene.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.435
Bob, put the oven on low.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.313
We'll be back before you can say Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen, and Nixon.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.898
Well, we'd better be back fast.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.067
Tonight's the night
we finally catch Santa Claus.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.861
-We've been planning this for months.
-You're gonna catch Santa?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.238
Yup. We built a Santa trap.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.116
All right, but if you catch him,
he's your responsibility.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.034
I'm not cleaning up after Santa.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.787
This is David Dazzle,
I'll be your pilot for tonight.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.623
Playing all your Christmas favorites
and some songs no one likes.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.917
Family road trip! Whoo!

02:06.001 --> 02:08.336
We're going to get a Christmas tree,
all right.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.379
-Again.
-Oh, Bobby.

02:09.462 --> 02:13.049
Stop being such a lump of coal.
This is what the holidays are all about.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.844
We're together,
there's Christmas music on the radio.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.638
Oh, give me the phone.
I want to request "Jingle in the Jungle."

02:18.722 --> 02:21.891
"Jingle in the Jungle?" That sounds like
a terrible Christmas song.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.478
Maybe you're not ready.
"Jingle in the Jungle" pushes the limits.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.148
Step on it, Dad.
We have a date with a fat old man.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.858
-We're chubby chasers.
-Tina, that's...

02:29.941 --> 02:32.318
Don't say that, that's not nice to say.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.529
-Fat fetishists?
-Kids, tickle your father.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.990
-He's being a big bah hum-booger. Get him.
-No, don't...

02:37.073 --> 02:38.575
-Get him!
-Don't tickle me.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.535
I'm gonna tickle your mustache!

02:40.618 --> 02:43.913
-All right, kids, cut it out.
-I'm gonna tickle your mustache!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.498
You don't tickle the driver!

02:45.582 --> 02:47.709
Whose hand is that? I can't see.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.754
- Use the windshield wipers.
- Lin, get the kids off me!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.757
Are these even Christmas trees?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.677
They're all so skinny and sick-looking.
Can you turn that one around, please?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.137
Mom wants to see its tree butt.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.640
Everybody's got their thing.
I'm more of a branch man.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.560
Okay, well, you guys decide
on which scrawny tree to buy.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.688
We're gonna go over there and practice
our Santa containment strategies.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.315
I assume he knows jujitsu.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.485
Uh, can I come? Your mom's gonna be
at least another half hour here.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.946
-Uh, you're not part of the plan, Dad.
-Well, I could help. I'm bigger than you.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.198
Yeah, but you're weak.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.825
Santa would drop you.
And that would kill me.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.744
-I could take Santa.
-Okay, Dad.

03:22.827 --> 03:26.039
Hey, Tina, thanks for helping Louise
beat up Santa.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.124
She really believes she can catch him.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.127
Yeah. It's so nice
that she still believes in this mission.

03:31.211 --> 03:35.340
It's weird, right? Isn't nine a little old
to, uh, believe that?

03:35.423 --> 03:38.510
-To believe what?
-That... What...

03:38.593 --> 03:40.261
-In the mission?
-Okay. Forget it.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.722
-Good talking to you.
-Good talking to you, Dad.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.642
Finally, a truck you're allowed to lick.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.146
Gene! Focus!
Okay, let's go through this again.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.148
We'll pretend the Porta Potty is the tree

03:52.232 --> 03:54.359
and Santa's on his way
to deliver presents.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.944
Gene, you be Santa.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.279
Phase one.
Santa passes right by the kitchen,

03:58.363 --> 04:01.032
where he sees cookies.
These rocks are the cookies.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.995
Phase two. Santa finds a note
that says "Milk in the fridge."

04:06.079 --> 04:07.122
I'm thirsty.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.123
Phase three!

04:08.206 --> 04:10.875
When he opens the fridge
and grabs the glass of milk, bam!

04:10.959 --> 04:13.545
His wrist is stuck in a zip tie!

04:13.628 --> 04:16.548
That's when I jump out
and wrap myself around his ankles.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.052
Then Tina jumps on his back
and makes Kringle crumble.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.596
I'll gouge out his eyes
and pull on his beard!

04:23.680 --> 04:26.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We want him alive, T.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.727
Sorry, I got carried away.
I'm glad we practiced.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.563
Kids, help me out. I can't see.
Am I good?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.731
Yeah, you're good.

04:32.814 --> 04:37.318
-You're very good.
-I thought you said I was good.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.738
How could you guys not see
that giant candy cane truck?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.032
We see it. We just don't make
a big deal out of it.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.785
Great, I'm not getting traction.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.537
I thought we were gonna get snow tires.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.248
-Was gonna be my Christmas present to you.
-Aw.

04:50.331 --> 04:54.586
Because I wasn't expecting to be out
in the snow, buying a Christmas tree.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.299
Hey! Jackass! Quit honking at my family!

04:59.382 --> 05:02.218
-We're having a Christmas moment here.
-Lin, just stop.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.511
Bob, let me handle this.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.389
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

05:06.473 --> 05:08.308
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

05:08.391 --> 05:10.393
-Lin.
-What? I'm doing "Jingle Bells."

05:10.477 --> 05:12.395
He's just hearing honking. Now, stop.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.813
Come on, kids. Sing along!

05:13.897 --> 05:15.148
♪ Jingle bells ♪

05:15.231 --> 05:17.317
Kids, don't sing "Jingle Bells."

05:17.400 --> 05:20.528
-♪ Jingle all the way ♪
-♪ Jingle all the bells ♪

05:20.612 --> 05:22.197
- Jingle, jingle.
- There we go.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.948
Everybody stop jingling.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.493
How long does the normal
person stay on hold?

05:26.576 --> 05:27.869
-Four hours?
-Oh, great.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.205
This guy again. I guess,
he's not in a hurry anymore.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.874
-Maybe the speed limit is seven.
-I'm gonna pass him.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
You can't be serious. Is he speeding up?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.798
What's this guy's problem?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.177
So, you guys excited
to decorate the tree?

05:44.260 --> 05:46.513
I don't know if we should put
any ornaments on it.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.431
-It looked pretty fragile.
-What?

05:48.515 --> 05:51.601
Yeah, somebody give that tree a sandwich
and a bowl of soup.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.023
-Oh, my God.
-Aw, be nice to the tree.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.525
It is December, Mom.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.528
Shouldn't you be decorating
for the Fourth of July?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.280
Stop speeding up.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.702
-Let me in!
-Bob, who you talking to?

06:12.414 --> 06:13.873
Oh, my God! That was close!

06:13.957 --> 06:16.584
You almost drove us
right into that snow plow, Bobby.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.962
Good thing you don't have any children
in the backseat.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.965
It wasn't my fault.
That trucker is driving like a lunatic.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.009
-More like you are.
-No. It was him.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.510
I just want to get away from him.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.848
Now he's right on my ass.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.475
This guy's trying to kill us.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.603
I'll pull off the road right there.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.607
Yes!

06:47.115 --> 06:49.951
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.537
Is everybody okay?

06:52.620 --> 06:53.913
-I'm fine.
-I'm great!

06:53.997 --> 06:55.749
-I didn't pee my pants.
-Good, Gene.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.168
Why wasn't I scared?
Wait, that was terrifying.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.795
-Now I have to pee.
-Okay, just go pee outside.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.381
No. It will freeze up
and go up inside my body.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.800
What the hell was that?
You trying to get us killed?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.511
Me? That trucker just ran us off
the road, Lin.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.597
- The pee is winning.
- Gene, just hold it.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.767
Okay, so every time somebody
tailgates you, you drive off the road?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.770
That wasn't tailgating,
that was intimidation.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.230
By an adorable candy cane truck.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.900
Urination begins in three, two...

07:21.983 --> 07:24.569
Gene, Gene.
We'll take you to pee in that diner.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.488
Hurry up. We need to get back on the road.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.614
It might take a minute.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.949
My bladder asked if my colon
could come out and play,

07:30.033 --> 07:31.368
my colon was like, "Sure."

07:31.451 --> 07:35.622
Oh, Bobby. They make
Dutch Babies here. Let's order one.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.706
What's a Dutch Baby?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.250
About $2,000 less than an American baby?

07:39.334 --> 07:42.128
No, it's their world-famous
high-rise pancake.

07:42.212 --> 07:45.298
It says it takes 25 minutes to make.
We don't have time.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.966
I have a ham in the oven, remember?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.135
-Just fart, Dad. It's okay.
-Tina, stop.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.721
You almost ran our family
off the road, remember?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.724
We're getting a Dutch Baby.
We'll get it to go. Dutch Baby, please.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.059
But the ham will dry out.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.061
You could call Teddy.
He's got a spare key.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.854
I bet you he'd turn off the oven.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.274
Sure thing, Bobby. I was gonna watch
church on TV, but I can just DVR it.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.735
We just need you to turn off the oven.
That's all, Teddy.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.113
Oh. Uh, I'm not really much of a cook.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.989
I don't spend a lot of time
in the kitchen.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.950
-As you probably know.
-It's not hard, Teddy.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.077
-You just turn the knob...
-Whoa. Slow down, Bob.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.246
-Let me get a pen. Hold on.
-You don't need a pen.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.332
-You just need to turn the knob to "off."
-Turn the knob to...? Go.

08:19.416 --> 08:23.503
-Off. Oh, my God.
-Off. Okay. O-F...

08:23.586 --> 08:25.714
This thing's not working.
Why is it you always...

08:25.797 --> 08:27.549
You never have one that works... Hold on.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.759
Just go to our house
and turn off the oven.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.636
Okay. Bob, did you get my Christmas card?

08:31.720 --> 08:32.637
Teddy, I gotta go.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.305
Bobby, did you get
the Christmas card?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.016
-Not yet.
-Not everyone got them.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.852
Oh, they got a pecan pie.
Should we get a pie while we wait?

08:38.935 --> 08:40.854
Do I look different? I feel different.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.565
-Phone. Give me the phone.
-Why?

08:43.648 --> 08:44.816
I want to get back on hold.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.527
It's the only place I know
who I am anymore.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.905
Hm. Uh, excuse me, Officer.
Hi. Over here.

08:50.989 --> 08:55.076
Uh, yes. I would like to report a crime.
I was just run off the road

08:55.160 --> 08:57.746
by a truck shaped like a giant candy cane.

08:59.205 --> 09:03.877
Do you want to, maybe, write that down,
or call it in? Hello?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.922
-Are you injured in any way?
-Um, no.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.675
-Was there any damage to your vehicle?
-No.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.511
So, what, was he mean to you?
A truck driver was mean to you?

09:13.595 --> 09:15.764
-Oh, snap!
-Louise, stop.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.808
Why do they call you "the fuzz?"
Is it because of your head?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.144
Gene. Sorry, don't listen to them,
officer.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.896
But, maybe, listen to me?

09:22.979 --> 09:25.648
Because it doesn't seem like
you're doing that.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.194
-Sir, I am trying to enjoy my Dutch Baby.
-Looks good.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.655
There's a very dangerous man out there,
driving around in a huge candy cane.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.241
I'm gonna need you to slide back down
into your booth.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.661
Officer, you just gotta listen to me.
Sorry about that.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.330
-Did you just hit that waitress?
-No.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.041
-Yes, you did.
-I mean, yes, I did, but it was a mistake.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.876
Why would you hit someone on Christmas?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.836
It's because this guy
wasn't listening to me.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.422
If you slap more waitresses,
I'll get right on it.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.216
Fine. Linda, kids, we're leaving.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.467
-No more Dutch Babies!
-No!

09:52.550 --> 09:54.177
-I think that's a good idea.
-Let's go.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.930
-My Baby hasn't been delivered yet.
-Lin, come on.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.224
Oh, look, it came out in 22 minutes.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.768
Oh, it's a preemie, just like Jesus.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.353
Hello?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.688
Anybody home?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.190
I know there's not, but I have manners.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.025
That ham smells good.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.528
Wish my place smelled this hammy.
Bob's really got it all.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.781
Oh, it's just a dial.
Why did Bob make it so complicated?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.117
There's my Christmas card.
Bob didn't open it.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.868
What's he waiting for,
actual Christmas?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.038
Hello, cookies. I'll accept a tip.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.083
Tree, or a reindeer?
Ah, they probably taste the same.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.128
Or maybe they don't. Maybe I find out.
Who knows?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.547
I need some milk.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.299
"The milk is in the fridge." Okay.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.468
"To reach milk,

10:35.552 --> 10:39.180
place your hand through Christmas
wrist wreath." That sounds fun.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.894
What's going on?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.355
Oh, man!

10:50.817 --> 10:51.860
Ooh, pickles.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.696
Hope you're happy.
You almost got this family arrested.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.948
You know, the only reason
we're even driving around

10:57.032 --> 11:00.869
on Christmas Eve, Lin, is because
you bought a tree on November 1.

11:00.952 --> 11:04.330
Your negative attitude
is what probably killed our tree.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.958
Both of you, shush! We got to get home!

11:07.042 --> 11:08.835
Santa's not gonna kidnap himself.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.295
It's the one thing he can't do.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.216
Oh, my God. Is that him?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.845
It's the candy cane truck.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.473
Oh, here we go.
Bob and his truck, everybody.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.309
Why is he in the middle?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.857
Why is he coming so fast? Bobby! Bobby!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.443
Oh, my God!

11:36.321 --> 11:38.698
Bob, that candy cane truck
is trying to kill us!

11:38.782 --> 11:40.116
That's what I've been saying!

11:40.200 --> 11:41.451
We don't listen to you!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.286
Oh, my Dutch Baby!

11:43.370 --> 11:45.288
Get it out from under the pedals, Lin!

11:45.372 --> 11:47.290
You're mushing it!
You're killing her!

11:47.374 --> 11:48.792
So, you believe me now?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.835
Oh, I'm so sorry, I doubted you, Bobby.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.672
It was like that time you said
you flushed but I know you didn't.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.507
-I flushed.
-I saw what I saw.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.342
I still see it when I close my eyes.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.928
We don't have time for this.
We have to call the police.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.972
-Give your mom the phone.
-I can't. I'm on hold with the station.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.891
You've been on hold this whole time?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.018
"Jingle in the Jungle"
is an American classic.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.479
-You'll thank me when you hear it.
-Give her the phone!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.607
-The battery's dead!
-Damn it, Gene!

12:12.691 --> 12:15.735
All batteries die,
but this one truly lived.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.362
Hang on, everybody!

12:18.947 --> 12:20.990
What are you doing?
I thought the car would

12:21.074 --> 12:23.410
spin all the way around,
like in the movies.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.329
-Oh, we can't shake this guy.
-I'm gonna go down that little road.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.920
Bobby, do something. He's coming back.
This guy's crazy.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.423
I'll pull the car in there,
shut off the lights.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.841
Maybe he won't see us.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.935
Everybody stay still and be very quiet.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.521
-Can I just say one thing?
-No, Gene.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.315
I think I have the best legs
in the family.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.277
-And the smoothest bottom.
-Okay, no more talking.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.362
- Mom? Dad?
- Oh, my God.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.488
Wanted to let you know.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.241
-I was the one who didn't flush.
-It's okay, sweetheart.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.910
That was impressive though.
It looked just like your father's.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.913
-That's what I was going for.
-Can everybody just please stop talking?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.623
I know what the Von Trapps felt like.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.750
-Dad?
-What?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.543
Where do babies come from?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.837
You all come from my vagina.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.507
-I knew it. You owe me 10 dollars, Tina.
-Everybody stop.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.511
He's right there.
He's right there.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.181
- Can he see us?
- I don't know.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.395
He's leaving.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.612
-He's gone.
-All right.

13:40.695 --> 13:44.699
Nobody is saying it, so I'll just say it.
I saved all of our lives.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.868
-Merry Christmas.
-Come on, let's go home!

13:46.951 --> 13:49.079
-We have time to do the tree.
-Oh, no.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.831
- No! No! No!
- What? What happened?

13:51.915 --> 13:55.043
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.588
Nobody's saying it, so I'll just say it.
Dad ruined Christmas.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.300
It's like a disco.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.264
-It's working!
-Oh, God!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.227
Come on, come on, we can do it.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.186
We couldn't do it.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.231
I told you we should drive a motorcycle
with four side cars.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.899
Then we would never be in this mess!

14:17.982 --> 14:20.276
What are we gonna do, Bobby?
We got to get out of here.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.112
I nominate Tina to walk for help.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.738
Just to be nominated is an honor.

14:23.822 --> 14:27.450
Don't worry. We'll figure something out.
We're not missing Christmas. I promise.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.661
Hey, look at that,
it's just past midnight.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.287
Merry Christmas, everyone.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.540
Merry Christmas, Radio DJ.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.500
Hey, no one's called in
for this one tonight,

14:35.583 --> 14:38.420
but I'm playing it anyway.
Here's "Jingle in the Jungle."

14:38.503 --> 14:40.505
Yay, Christmas miracle!

14:40.588 --> 14:43.591
- I wasn't expecting so much bongo.
- I like it.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.596
You know what? Who needs a nice cozy,
warm, comfortable home?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.890
We can have our own Christmas
right here in the car.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.685
Yeah, until it runs out of gas
and we freeze to death.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.478
-Yeah.
-It's like we're a family of cops,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.604
staking out that bush.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.318
That's a dumb place to keep bowls.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.988
And all was right
with the world, and-- Oh!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.991
Look what the wise men bought
from the auto parts store.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.993
Let's all sing "Silent Night."

15:12.328 --> 15:17.751
♪ Silent Night ♪

15:17.834 --> 15:19.919
♪ Holy... ♪

15:20.003 --> 15:21.588
Crap! Truck!

15:21.671 --> 15:23.214
Bobby, we got to get out of here!

15:24.632 --> 15:25.884
It's still not working.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.262
Okay, everybody just stay calm.
We're safe here in the car.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.223
I have a plan. Get out of the car,
run in different directions.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.725
He'll catch the slowest one.

15:33.808 --> 15:37.437
-Gene, you're the slowest one!
-Ah, I'm the slowest one!

15:37.520 --> 15:38.438
No, get back here!

15:41.024 --> 15:43.485
Maybe it's a different candy cane truck?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.947
Oh, my God.
This is it. We're trapped.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.116
Kids, get in the car, now.
Lock the doors.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.993
Everybody, stay calm. I'll handle this.

15:52.077 --> 15:56.122
Oh, thank God. Dad's on it.
The handler's got it covered, guys. Relax!

15:56.206 --> 15:57.540
Bob, be careful.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.460
-Tell him you had asthma.
-And you have bad night vision.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.004
Listen, uh, sir.

16:03.088 --> 16:06.007
Whatever it is you want, we're just
trying to get home for Christmas.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.300
Can we just talk this out?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.389
Oh, you look like that.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.601
Um, okay. Uh, you seem
like a small, reasonable guy.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.062
If this is about earlier,
I'm sorry, I cut you off.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.481
I don't wanna point fingers,
but it was my kids' fault.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.565
Yeah, Dad. Great.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.110
For Christmas, I wanted you
to throw us under the bus.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.612
Let's do this! Me and you.

16:27.696 --> 16:31.074
It's go time! Just take my coat off!

16:32.826 --> 16:34.703
- Fight me!
- No.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.663
-No.
-I'll fight him, punk!

16:36.746 --> 16:38.623
-Come on, punk!
-Lin, stay in the car.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.959
Listen, this is crazy.
I mean, why are you so angry?

16:41.042 --> 16:42.585
Just because I cut you off?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.046
You also kept honking at me. Repeatedly.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.716
It was "Jingle Bells."
You don't know "Jingle Bells"?

16:49.009 --> 16:51.928
Put them up, snowflake.
Oh, we're gonna dance.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.180
Are you shivering?
Put your jacket back on.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.433
Oh, I'm fine.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.310
Look, how about this?
My car is stuck in the snow.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.604
If you can-- You're really shivering.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.400
If you could help us pull it out
because you have a big truck...

17:05.483 --> 17:08.987
I'm about to bang your ass,
and you're asking me for help?

17:09.070 --> 17:11.573
-"Bang my ass"?
-Yeah, bang your ass!

17:11.656 --> 17:14.242
Okay, I mean, you mean... Okay.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.119
I've never heard it said that way.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.163
-What? Bang?
-You mean, beat me up.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.999
I think I meant kick.
I'm pretty-- I think I meant kick.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.168
It was, like, halfway out
of my mouth and I went,

17:23.251 --> 17:26.254
"Ooh, that could be taken the wrong way."
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

17:26.338 --> 17:27.339
All right, I... Look.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.758
I'll tell you what, if you pull our car
out of the snow,

17:29.841 --> 17:31.843
I'll let you punch me in the stomach.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.136
Bobby. Psst.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.721
You're gonna let this guy hit you?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.473
He's just a sad, little guy, Lin.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.434
I don't think it's gonna hurt.
I'll just act like it does.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.478
-Do your girl scream.
-What girl scream?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.647
-I think she means your regular scream.
-And then do your girl walk.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.442
-Girl walk? I don't have a girl walk.
-Yeah, you do this like...

17:49.402 --> 17:51.571
-I don't do that.
-Agree to disagree.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.699
Look, I think this guy's having
a worse Christmas than us.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.451
He seems like he really needs this.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.787
Aw, that's the holiday spirit, Bobby.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.955
Oh.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.541
So cold. And crisp.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.877
I guess I'm near the crisper.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.505
I'm not gonna last much longer...

18:08.588 --> 18:10.632
Maybe I can get to the knives
on the counter.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.635
I could cut my way out.
Teddy, you got to try.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.472
Just pretend you're moving a fridge
for Bob.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.476
So, Bobby, you got a new fridge, huh?

18:21.559 --> 18:23.561
What else is new with you? Uh-oh.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.522
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.566
Now I'm gonna die looking
at Gene's finger painting.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.360
What is that even supposed to be?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.362
So, do we have a deal?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.365
-I want to punch your stupid face!
-No, just the stomach.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.367
How about I kick you in the neck?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.953
You get one punch to the stomach,
then get us out of here.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.790
-Fine, but I need to borrow your jacket.
-Look, let's just get this over with.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.050
Christmas is just
a really hard time for me.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.011
I wish I was with my family.

18:56.094 --> 19:00.056
Aw, he's not with his family.
Poor thing's all alone on Christmas.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.476
And then you cut me off,
and that was the last straw.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.146
That's why I wanted to bang your butt.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.356
I thought we agreed
not to say that.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.109
-All right.
-Listen, I'm sorry I cut you off.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.570
I'm sorry you have to work on Christmas.
That's rough.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.406
Tell me about it.
I have to drive through the night

19:16.489 --> 19:19.784
to get from a Christmas Eve parade
to a Christmas Day parade.

19:19.868 --> 19:23.038
-Oh, that's an awful lot of driving.
-And a lot of information.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.081
Sounds like you're having
a horrible Christmas.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.125
Great, we've bonded,
can I lick your truck now?

19:27.208 --> 19:29.711
Probably the crappiest Christmas ever.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.714
Guess you just needed someone
to take out your frustration on.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.341
Exactly!

19:34.424 --> 19:36.551
Thought we'd worked past
the whole punching thing.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.305
Nope. Whoo! Boy, that felt good.
Man, I really needed that.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.598
Hi, my name's Gary.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.392
Hey, Gary. Bob. You're pretty strong.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.436
Let's see if we can get you guys
out of here.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.938
How do you know
if you have internal bleeding?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.775
I can tell. I can tell. Let me listen.
Let me listen.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.736
All right! Here we go!

19:54.819 --> 19:57.113
-Thanks, Gary.
-No problem!

19:58.114 --> 20:00.950
I'm gonna get back
into my, uh, prison on wheels now.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.285
-Okay!
-Aw.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.579
You just need a little Christmas cheer
in there.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.373
Bobby, give him the tree.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.249
What? No.
The tree is the whole reason...

20:08.333 --> 20:09.751
Give him the tree!

20:09.834 --> 20:11.378
-All right.
-That's so nice.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.463
Hey, come here.
You ever have a Dutch Baby?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.256
Put that in your mouth. Merry Christmas.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.176
This is good. Can't even taste the baby.

20:18.259 --> 20:21.221
Yeah. Oh, oh, God, he's so hungry, look.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.016
We got him!

20:25.975 --> 20:28.561
-Oh, my God, Teddy.
-Teddy is Santa!

20:28.645 --> 20:30.522
I found the Christmas card
you didn't open.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.566
It's right there on the counter.
Open the card while I'm here.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.193
You'd rather me do that than try...

20:35.276 --> 20:39.698
Open the card, then get the fridge.
Oh, well, anyway, it's just a cat.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.032
What does it say?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.535
It says "Meow-y Christmas."

20:43.618 --> 20:45.829
Yup, yeah. That's cute.
