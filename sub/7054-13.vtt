WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.803
- I'm going for a week, not until the end of time.
- Yeah.

00:02.870 --> 00:04.037
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:04.122 --> 00:06.123
Our Agent Dunham...
Has she made contact?

00:06.190 --> 00:09.076
She's on the other side
focused on the task at hand.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.860
Since you got back
from the other side,

00:10.912 --> 00:12.245
it's like you're
a completely different person.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.347
How'd you do it?

00:13.414 --> 00:15.031
How'd you replace our Olivia?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.800
Listen, whatever happens to me,

00:16.867 --> 00:18.635
I want you to know that this
started out as an assignment,

00:18.703 --> 00:20.087
- but it became...
- Something more.

00:20.171 --> 00:21.938
That would be
so much easier to believe

00:22.006 --> 00:24.841
if you weren't
in handcuffs right now.

00:30.932 --> 00:33.350
Have you seen Colonel Broyles?
He's late to work this morning.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.819
His wife said that he did not
come home last night,

00:35.886 --> 00:38.689
and that is...
is very unlike him.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.232
<i>Final boarding

01:22.283 --> 01:24.434
Guess who.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.102
Uh...

01:26.154 --> 01:27.871
Well, the voice isn't familiar,

01:27.938 --> 01:29.939
but, uh, the hands I like.

01:29.991 --> 01:34.661
They're kind of...
rugged and sexy.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.464
Oh. No, sorry.

01:37.548 --> 01:39.800
I... I...
I don't recognize you.

01:39.884 --> 01:41.051
No, it's my fault.

01:41.118 --> 01:42.719
- I thought you were someone else.
- Oh.

01:42.787 --> 01:43.920
Well, you should
probably leave,

01:43.971 --> 01:45.455
because I'm waiting
for my boyfriend,

01:45.506 --> 01:47.307
and we haven't seen
each other for a few months,

01:47.392 --> 01:49.142
and he's really big
and strong, so...

01:49.227 --> 01:52.145
But, you know, actually,
now that I think about it,

01:52.230 --> 01:55.632
there is something in your face
that's kind of ringing a bell.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.434
Yeah, maybe...

01:57.485 --> 02:01.971
- Maybe it's my, um, lips.
- Hmm.

02:04.859 --> 02:07.828
It's so good to be home.
You hungry?

02:07.912 --> 02:09.446
<i>Due to inclement
weather over the midwest,</i>

02:09.497 --> 02:11.248
<i>the following flights

02:11.315 --> 02:13.917
<i>Glatterflug flight 7 bound

02:13.984 --> 02:18.038
<i>Gotham air 3 bound

02:18.122 --> 02:22.542
"Everybody talks about the weather.
Nobody does anything about it."

02:24.161 --> 02:25.996
I'm quoting Samuel Clemens.

02:27.849 --> 02:29.299
You stranded too?

02:29.367 --> 02:31.134
In a way, yeah, I, uh...

02:31.185 --> 02:33.353
I'm waiting on someone
who got delayed.

02:38.843 --> 02:40.861
Could you pass me
the salt, please?

02:40.945 --> 02:43.029
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.367
Thank you.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.629
- How was the shower?
- It was hot. I was beginning to think

02:59.697 --> 03:01.832
there wasn't a hot shower
anywhere in North Texas.

03:01.883 --> 03:03.633
Well, welcome back
to civilization.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.302
Well, to what
do I owe the honor?

03:05.369 --> 03:06.636
You're a national hero.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.922
I figured you deserve
the good stuff.

03:09.006 --> 03:10.757
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

03:13.544 --> 03:15.762
Hmm. It's good.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.070
Liv...

03:24.155 --> 03:26.606
Everything all right?

03:26.691 --> 03:29.192
What do you mean?

03:29.243 --> 03:30.727
I don't know.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.246
It's just, uh...
Didn't say a word to me

03:33.331 --> 03:35.248
on the drive back
from the airport.

03:35.333 --> 03:38.752
And when I'd call from Texas,
you seemed a bit distant.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.540
Well, we were distant.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.041
Yeah, I know.

03:45.092 --> 03:49.045
Just you almost...
didn't seem like yourself.

03:51.415 --> 03:53.249
Oh.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.136
You know,
work's just been kind of crazy.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.189
Look, I know when I'm away,
we can be a bit off.

03:59.256 --> 04:02.275
Just want to make sure it's
not something more.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.278
No.

04:05.363 --> 04:06.947
It's just everything's
a little overwhelming

04:07.031 --> 04:08.865
since Broyles went missing.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.901
Do you have any leads?

04:10.952 --> 04:14.604
No. They, uh, found his car
at the edge of a no-go zone,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.488
but nobody knows
why it was in there.

04:16.574 --> 04:17.741
Something classified?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.108
Possibly, yeah.

04:20.161 --> 04:23.279
Uh, Lincoln's taking over
in his absence.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.915
He keeps pressing
all the official channels,

04:24.982 --> 04:26.416
but we're not getting
any answers.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.501
They stopped the search.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.622
I'm sorry
I couldn't be here for you.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.257
I know how you feel about him.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.476
Well, you're here now.

04:36.561 --> 04:41.481
- And I'm glad about that.
- Me too.

05:01.002 --> 05:01.985
Help.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.421
Please, help.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.610
You have any idea
how much I missed

06:09.694 --> 06:11.578
watching you get dressed
in the morning?

06:13.564 --> 06:14.748
What time is it?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.867
Uh, it's about 8:00.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.702
I thought you might like
to sleep in.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.920
Yeah. Thank you.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.211
Hey, uh...

06:27.262 --> 06:32.749
- You want to get away this weekend?
- Uh, sure. Where?

06:32.817 --> 06:35.519
I don't know.
How about we hop on an airship

06:35.586 --> 06:37.471
and go down to Annapolis
like we used to?

06:37.555 --> 06:39.223
- Annapolis?
- Yeah.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.358
We can go to the crab shack
on the wharf or...

06:41.425 --> 06:42.726
- Obrecky's?
- Right.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.262
Remember how great
their jukebox was?

06:45.313 --> 06:47.764
I would love that.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.768
Dunham.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.823
Okay.
I'm on my way.

06:57.775 --> 07:00.294
Bye.

07:15.677 --> 07:18.645
Hey. I heard they're rerouting
all the flights from Newark...

07:18.730 --> 07:20.130
Bomb scare?

07:20.181 --> 07:22.983
Nope.
Spontaneous bug eruption.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.801
Guy named Harry Millman,
42 years old...

07:24.853 --> 07:26.737
They found him in the bathroom.

07:26.804 --> 07:29.940
Bugs had eaten their way
from the inside out.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.242
Oh, fabulous.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.745
Gosh, I was just here
last night picking up Frank.

07:34.812 --> 07:37.281
- So, bugs.
- Yep.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.116
Ugh, you know
how I feel about bugs.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.251
Not Charlie.

07:41.319 --> 07:42.703
Charlie loves bugs.

07:42.787 --> 07:44.487
Look lively, people.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.323
New boss is here.

07:46.374 --> 07:48.491
How is it that
when you say "boss,"

07:48.543 --> 07:50.177
it sounds like insubordination?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.795
You see, that's my tone.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.331
Maybe that's why I didn't get
the promotion.

07:54.382 --> 07:55.933
Yeah, maybe,
or else I'm better than you.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.468
Okay, so they're pretty,
but what are they?

07:58.520 --> 07:59.937
No idea.
We've been through what...

08:00.004 --> 08:01.471
Three different insect databases?

08:01.523 --> 08:05.058
We still can't find a match.

08:05.143 --> 08:07.895
What happened
to the other passengers?

08:07.979 --> 08:10.547
We contacted
about half of them.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.850
Apparently, the bugs don't live
outside the body too long.

08:13.902 --> 08:15.152
And if somebody
had been infected,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.486
we would have heard
about it by now.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.021
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.

08:18.089 --> 08:19.873
Maybe some kind of
mutant insect bit him,

08:19.958 --> 08:21.625
laid eggs under his skin?

08:21.692 --> 08:23.293
That's comforting.

08:23.361 --> 08:25.579
Looks like we got a live one.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.303
Gotcha.

08:41.879 --> 08:45.649
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Secretary.

08:45.716 --> 08:48.852
I see the piece
that Agent Dunham obtained

08:48.903 --> 08:50.187
was finally sent over.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.072
Yes, and it seems
to be functional.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.925
We should have it integrated
with the machine by week's end.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.610
Good.

08:56.694 --> 08:59.496
That's actually not why
I asked you here.

08:59.563 --> 09:01.999
The experiments
with the chemical

09:02.066 --> 09:05.335
we synthesized
from the other Olivia's brain...

09:05.403 --> 09:08.255
It appears there's been
a breakthrough.

09:13.411 --> 09:16.847
This subject was given
his second dose of the day.

09:16.914 --> 09:19.132
43 minutes later,
this happened.

09:19.217 --> 09:20.884
- Crossed over?
- No.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.053
<i>Danny?</i>

09:23.104 --> 09:25.689
<i>How are you doing this?</i>

09:25.756 --> 09:27.858
<i>I... I don't...</i>

09:27.925 --> 09:29.693
<i>Don't know.</i>

09:29.760 --> 09:31.228
<i>I'm just...</i>

09:31.279 --> 09:35.649
<i>Just thinking it...
And it's happening.</i>

09:37.619 --> 09:39.786
<i>Aah!</i>

09:39.871 --> 09:42.155
<i>Oh, my God! Danny!</i>

09:44.492 --> 09:46.043
<i>Call Dr. Jackson!</i>

09:47.962 --> 09:53.550
Nine test subjects get an injection
and die within thirty minutes.

09:53.617 --> 09:56.820
This one develops
a telekinetic ability.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.422
What's the difference?

09:58.489 --> 10:00.340
We'll know more
after we dissect his brain,

10:00.425 --> 10:01.624
but I have a theory...

10:01.676 --> 10:04.061
Age.

10:04.128 --> 10:07.064
This subject was the youngest
of the group,

10:07.131 --> 10:09.199
which would make sense,
given your notion

10:09.267 --> 10:12.069
that the human brain
is infinitely capable at birth.

10:12.136 --> 10:14.237
We simply need
younger subjects.

10:14.305 --> 10:16.189
- I think that children...
- No.

10:20.528 --> 10:21.912
Sir, we may be close.

10:21.979 --> 10:23.080
No children.

10:23.147 --> 10:24.981
That is not an option.

10:25.033 --> 10:28.318
You'll have to try
something else.

10:44.001 --> 10:46.103
Drop your file request
on the table.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.604
I'm a little busy right now.

10:47.671 --> 10:48.939
Uh, Fringe Division.

10:49.006 --> 10:51.224
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham,
and this is Agent...

10:51.309 --> 10:52.776
Agent Charlie Foster...

10:52.843 --> 10:54.677
Francis.

10:54.729 --> 10:56.363
I'm Foster...

10:56.447 --> 10:57.814
Mona Foster.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.683
We, uh... We...
We met before?

11:00.735 --> 11:03.520
I treated you
for your arachnid infestation.

11:03.571 --> 11:05.172
I'm not surprised
you don't remember me.

11:05.239 --> 11:07.624
You were in a lot of pain.

11:07.691 --> 11:09.025
So how are the spiders?

11:09.077 --> 11:10.860
Uh, they're good.

11:10.912 --> 11:13.663
They... They...
Sometimes they just itch a little bit.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.134
Maybe you just need
someone to scratch it.

11:17.201 --> 11:18.552
Hmm.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.256
So...

11:23.341 --> 11:25.976
What brings Fringe here today?

11:27.929 --> 11:30.063
It's order <i>Coleoptera</i>,
for sure,

11:30.148 --> 11:33.517
<i>Archostemata</i> maybe,
but species?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.519
No clue.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.987
Where did you find this?

11:37.054 --> 11:38.889
Uh, the Empire Docking Station.

11:38.956 --> 11:41.274
That's kind of an unusual
habitat for beetles.

11:41.359 --> 11:43.226
They ate their way
out of a person.

11:43.277 --> 11:44.561
Interesting...

11:44.612 --> 11:46.496
Yeah.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.498
Wait here a minute.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.868
- Don't even start with me.
- Oh...

11:51.919 --> 11:54.671
- Don't...
- Bug girl's got a crush on Charlie.

11:54.738 --> 11:56.456
Bug girl has a crush
on the fact

11:56.541 --> 11:58.341
that I got spiders
in my blood, kiddo.

11:58.409 --> 12:00.043
Come on, everybody's
looking for someone

12:00.094 --> 12:02.745
that's gonna like them
for who they are inside, right?

12:02.797 --> 12:04.181
Are you kidding me right now?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.184
Skelter beetle...

12:07.251 --> 12:08.969
<i>Mansohnium boogliosus</i>,

12:09.053 --> 12:10.520
which answers one question

12:10.588 --> 12:12.856
but raises
a whole bunch of others.

12:12.923 --> 12:16.109
- Such as?
- Such as how is this here?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.527
Skelter beetles are parasitic.

12:17.595 --> 12:19.529
They lived exclusively in sheep.

12:19.597 --> 12:20.864
Sheep.

12:20.931 --> 12:23.733
And given that all the sheep
died out ten years ago...

12:23.801 --> 12:25.535
The bugs died with them.

12:25.603 --> 12:28.905
What was it doing
inside of a person?

12:31.442 --> 12:35.912
Specimen number 7
was harvested twelve hours ago

12:35.963 --> 12:38.348
after a twenty-minute
gestation period.

12:38.416 --> 12:42.419
I have extracted
the epigastric tissue

12:42.470 --> 12:45.121
from the beetle's abdomen

12:45.173 --> 12:46.956
and...

12:47.008 --> 12:49.910
And placed it
into the substrate.

12:49.977 --> 12:54.147
I am now adding 10 milliliters

12:54.232 --> 12:58.134
of the protein complex
to catalyze a reaction.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.138
If the enzyme is present...

13:05.142 --> 13:08.144
The indicator will turn pink.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.959
Come on.

13:53.549 --> 13:56.050
Get local P.D. to check the house
if she's not answering her phone.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.086
Passenger 23 is clear.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.421
Passenger 9 is clear.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.223
We've also fully accounted
for zeppelin crew

14:02.308 --> 14:04.225
- and ground personnel.
- The food for the airship...

14:04.310 --> 14:05.977
It's supplied
by an LFC Food Services.

14:06.044 --> 14:07.512
And it checks out clean so far.

14:07.563 --> 14:09.063
You're wasting your time.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.882
We're not dealing
with an outbreak.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.736
We've cleared 62.237%
of people

14:14.820 --> 14:16.404
who could possibly
have been exposed.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.556
That's enough to make
a statistical inference.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.391
This is not an epidemic.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.077
Where do I get one of you?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.363
I bet she drives a beetle.

14:25.414 --> 14:26.914
You're not funny.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.367
Listen, if you go on a date
with her and you're late,

14:29.418 --> 14:31.586
then at least you know
that she won't bug out.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.087
Wow. You're original.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.122
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.423
What are you doing here?

14:35.507 --> 14:37.091
Uh, Lincoln requested
a CDC liaison.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.543
I said I could help.

14:38.594 --> 14:40.211
Hey, Frank,

14:40.262 --> 14:41.596
how's cow country?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.748
Let's just say
I'm happy to be back.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.383
You find anything?

14:45.434 --> 14:48.970
Yep, <i>Mansohnium boogliosus</i>.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.921
Skelter beetle.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.090
They died out
with the sheep in '01.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.560
Huh. Never heard of them.
Let me look at that.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.599
I guess for you two
this kind of thing is romantic?

15:01.650 --> 15:03.317
Brings back memories, huh?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.102
- Hoboken?
- Uh-huh.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.988
There's nothing like
a little cholera outbreak

15:07.072 --> 15:09.157
to bring two people together.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.209
I can only imagine what it is
you see in a guy like that.

15:11.276 --> 15:13.411
Oh, he's kind of perfect,
isn't he?

15:13.462 --> 15:15.880
No, I am perfect,
but he's a close second.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.249
- Right.
- Right.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.802
So still nothing on how
our victim got infected?

15:20.886 --> 15:23.137
- Nope. If you learn anything, you let me know.
- Mm-hmm.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.922
I'll be in Broyles' off...

15:24.973 --> 15:27.308
I'll be in my office.

15:29.645 --> 15:30.928
See, what's odd is

15:30.979 --> 15:32.963
with the sheep they have
a symbiotic relationship,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.632
but now they're attacking
their host.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.983
They're eating their way out.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.902
So they look the same,
but they're not the same.

15:37.969 --> 15:40.071
Yeah.
Yeah, to put it simply.

15:40.138 --> 15:42.824
The question is why.
What... What changed?

15:42.908 --> 15:45.526
Why don't you just ask?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.078
What's that?

15:47.145 --> 15:49.030
When you don't know
the answer to something,

15:49.114 --> 15:50.531
you ask someone who does.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.500
Put out a Fringe Alert to the public.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.535
Odds are that someone
will recognize this beetle

15:54.620 --> 15:55.953
and call in a tip.

15:56.004 --> 15:57.839
In fact, statistics suggest

15:57.923 --> 15:59.173
you will get
at least two calls.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.675
I don't know
what they pay you here,

16:00.759 --> 16:02.660
but I definitely need you
in my life.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.549
Uh, do you mind?

16:13.555 --> 16:15.556
Hi. What can I get ya?

16:15.641 --> 16:19.560
A cup of Earl Grey
and a piece of, um, cherry pie.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.395
Okay.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.734
That looks complicated.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.453
What is it?

16:29.872 --> 16:31.956
I'm a scientist.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.992
This is my, uh, research,
but, uh...

16:35.043 --> 16:36.661
You probably
wouldn't understand.

16:36.712 --> 16:38.212
Well, try me.

16:40.883 --> 16:43.534
Do you know the name
Jonas Salk?

16:43.585 --> 16:46.704
Sure. Who doesn't?
He cured polio.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.806
Have you heard of...

16:48.874 --> 16:51.342
Watson and Crick?

16:51.410 --> 16:53.711
They're those DNA guys, right?

16:53.762 --> 16:57.515
That's right, yeah.

16:57.566 --> 17:00.718
How about, uh,
Dr. Armand Silva?

17:00.769 --> 17:03.254
Armand Silva.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.489
No. Don't know that one.

17:04.556 --> 17:06.574
Oh.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.726
You will.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.646
<i>Attention, citizens...</i>

17:11.713 --> 17:13.564
<i>this is a Fringe Alert.</i>

17:13.615 --> 17:15.199
<i>If you have seen
or have any information</i>

17:15.250 --> 17:17.602
<i>regarding this bug,
known as a skelter beetle,</i>

17:17.669 --> 17:21.622
<i>please call 711
and speak to Fringe Division.</i>

17:23.759 --> 17:25.710
Have you decided?

17:25.761 --> 17:27.077
Yeah.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.964
I'll have what he's having.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.272
Hey.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.641
Got a minute?
Can I ask a favor?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.143
Of course. What's up?

17:42.227 --> 17:44.028
I was hoping if the case
wraps up this weekend

17:44.095 --> 17:45.446
if Olivia could have
a few days.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.366
Why?
You two got, uh...

17:48.433 --> 17:50.535
Big plans or something?

17:50.602 --> 17:52.370
Yeah. Yeah,
you could say that.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.272
Sure.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.576
Can you, uh...
keep a secret?

17:58.627 --> 18:00.828
You kidding me?

18:00.913 --> 18:03.998
I have my own, like...
cone of silence

18:04.082 --> 18:06.083
when it comes to secrets.

18:06.134 --> 18:10.087
What is it?

18:10.138 --> 18:11.789
Ma'am, nobody's gonna eat
your dog, all right?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.123
Thank you for calling.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.892
No, sir, these bugs do not
have control of your wife.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.427
These people are freaks!

18:16.478 --> 18:18.062
What's going on in this city?

18:18.129 --> 18:19.397
I'm gonna get a sandwich.

18:19.464 --> 18:23.401
Uh, no, sir, I promise
that is not the way they work.

18:23.468 --> 18:25.102
Yes, you can feel free
to call us

18:25.153 --> 18:26.520
if something changes.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.472
Okay, thank you.

18:28.523 --> 18:30.024
How's it going?

18:30.108 --> 18:32.109
Um, well...

18:32.160 --> 18:33.494
We have had 200 phone calls,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.746
mostly from nut jobs
and scared...

18:35.814 --> 18:37.982
Frank's gonna ask you
to marry him.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.535
I'm serious.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.254
This weekend...
He just told me.

18:43.321 --> 18:45.006
I... I promised
I'd keep it a secret,

18:45.090 --> 18:48.092
but you know me,
I can't... keep a secret.

18:53.665 --> 18:56.934
Hey, I think I got
a legitimate call here.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.104
- Something up?
- No.

19:00.171 --> 19:02.106
- Uh-uh.
- Okay.

19:02.173 --> 19:04.358
Guy used to work
at a biology annex.

19:04.443 --> 19:08.029
Guy next door to him used to be
an expert on skelter beetles.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.448
Go. Go check it out.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.516
Great.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.855
So?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.874
What are you gonna say?

19:19.958 --> 19:21.859
To Frank?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.160
What?

19:23.211 --> 19:24.996
I can keep a secret.

19:25.047 --> 19:26.580
Yeah, that's it.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.499
Ah, I wish I could forget
these things.

19:28.550 --> 19:30.501
His name was Armand Silva.

19:30.552 --> 19:31.802
He was in virology
down the hall.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.537
Those damn things
were always getting out.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.923
I'm a scientist,
but I hate bugs.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.508
You know what
he was doing with them?

19:37.559 --> 19:38.559
I don't know.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.210
We were all working
on our own projects.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.730
I was harvesting sheep hearts
for valve replacement surgeries.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.548
So how are they back?
The bugs?

19:44.599 --> 19:46.383
Well, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.985
Do you know where
we can find Dr. Silva?

19:48.053 --> 19:49.904
No. In fact,
a few years ago,

19:49.988 --> 19:51.355
I heard he tried
to kill himself.

19:51.406 --> 19:54.191
I didn't really know him
that well, but, uh...

19:54.242 --> 19:56.577
It was like those bugs
were his whole life.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.263
When the sheep died out,
he was a mess.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.598
But if he's not dead,

20:00.666 --> 20:02.166
he's definitely the guy
you want to talk to.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.068
If anyone will know
how those bugs have come back,

20:04.119 --> 20:05.419
it'll be him.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.107
Jerry Bissell, aged 42,

20:33.158 --> 20:35.993
worked as a data systems
repairman.

20:36.078 --> 20:37.828
It says that he ate
at the Avenue Road Diner

20:37.913 --> 20:39.697
about three hours ago.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.782
Hey, I know that place.
It's right around the corner.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.117
No luck on Dr. Silva.

20:43.168 --> 20:45.152
His last known address
is outside of Boston,

20:45.203 --> 20:46.487
but nothing
in the system on him

20:46.538 --> 20:48.089
since the city
was ambered back in '04.

20:48.156 --> 20:50.174
- No record of his death either.
- No.

20:50.258 --> 20:52.510
Okay, so that means that
he's still out there somewhere.

20:52.594 --> 20:54.345
Hey, look at this...

20:54.429 --> 20:56.213
Right there.

21:02.504 --> 21:05.022
These are so much different.

21:05.107 --> 21:06.941
They're so much bigger.

21:10.695 --> 21:12.313
I'm gonna take it to forensics,

21:12.364 --> 21:14.181
see what they come up with.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.016
Hey, can you send someone
to the diner as well?

21:16.068 --> 21:17.651
Maybe somebody saw something.

21:17.702 --> 21:19.453
Oh, great.
Now I got, like, two bosses?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.659
What's wrong?

21:25.710 --> 21:29.463
Keep feeling like
I'm missing something...

21:29.531 --> 21:32.032
That Broyles would see
something I'm not.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.700
Lincoln, you're doing fine.

21:35.370 --> 21:38.339
Don't worry.
We'll catch this guy together.

21:47.682 --> 21:51.685
Do you want me to
give you some time alone?

21:51.736 --> 21:54.071
No. Please don't.

21:56.341 --> 21:58.409
What is it?

22:00.245 --> 22:01.812
You're lovely.
You know that?

22:01.880 --> 22:03.781
You're sweet.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.550
And you're also avoiding
answering my question.

22:15.427 --> 22:21.248
It's... many things.

22:21.299 --> 22:24.251
If you had asked me a week ago,

22:24.302 --> 22:25.803
I would have told you

22:25.871 --> 22:29.273
that I would sacrifice
anything...

22:29.357 --> 22:31.642
To save our world.

22:34.279 --> 22:38.149
But in fact, there are lines
I simply cannot cross.

22:45.457 --> 22:47.941
Does that make me weak?

22:47.993 --> 22:49.376
No.

22:49.444 --> 22:50.828
It's what makes you

22:50.912 --> 22:53.964
the most brilliant man
I've ever known.

22:54.049 --> 22:57.751
And the fact you beat yourself
up over these decisions...

22:57.802 --> 23:01.305
Now, that's what makes me
sure of this strength.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.346
I wish I had the same faith.

23:12.067 --> 23:15.152
I'm afraid I've failed, Reiko.

23:15.237 --> 23:18.189
Peter was here, and...

23:18.256 --> 23:20.591
He was here
of his own choosing,

23:20.659 --> 23:23.611
as he needs to be.

23:23.662 --> 23:27.147
And I lost him...

23:27.199 --> 23:30.534
I underestimated
his attachments over there.

23:32.504 --> 23:34.788
I hadn't factored in the girl.

23:34.839 --> 23:37.124
But now you know
about the girl.

23:37.192 --> 23:39.260
And you know Peter better.

23:39.327 --> 23:41.495
You'll get him back.

23:42.714 --> 23:46.166
How could you be so sure?

23:48.053 --> 23:49.336
Do you trust me?

23:49.404 --> 23:52.106
More than anyone.

23:52.173 --> 23:53.674
Well, then...

23:53.725 --> 23:57.061
Trust my perspective on this.

23:57.145 --> 23:59.847
I know you, Walter.

23:59.915 --> 24:04.151
I've seen your determination,
your will.

24:04.202 --> 24:06.537
I don't have
a single doubt in my mind

24:06.621 --> 24:08.739
you'll find an answer.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.708
You always do.

24:29.711 --> 24:31.812
- Hi.
- You're home.

24:36.484 --> 24:38.319
So I called Atlanta.

24:38.386 --> 24:41.188
I found out some information
on Dr. Silva.

24:41.239 --> 24:44.491
CDC had a grant he applied for
on file, back in '97.

24:44.559 --> 24:47.227
Claims he was close to a vaccine
for the avian flu.

24:47.279 --> 24:48.362
Gosh, if that's true...

24:48.413 --> 24:50.164
I know.
It would have saved millions.

24:50.231 --> 24:52.416
Thing is his research...

24:52.500 --> 24:54.201
It reads a little off the wall.

24:54.252 --> 24:55.836
Here, take a look at this.

24:55.903 --> 24:57.871
The vaccine
was based on an enzyme

24:57.922 --> 24:59.506
that the skelter beetle
produced.

24:59.574 --> 25:01.342
And that got me thinking.

25:01.409 --> 25:02.543
You think he's trying to bring

25:02.594 --> 25:04.278
the skelter beetle
back from extinction?

25:04.346 --> 25:05.963
Is that even possible?

25:06.047 --> 25:08.382
Possible, yeah.
Certainly not easy.

25:08.450 --> 25:11.018
He'd have to clone DNA
from a preserved specimen.

25:11.085 --> 25:13.470
But the real problem would be
that the eggs would never hatch.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.522
- Because they only live in sheep.
- Exactly.

25:15.590 --> 25:17.924
He'd have to modify them.
He'd have to re-engineer them

25:17.976 --> 25:19.560
- to live in a different host.
- Like people.

25:19.611 --> 25:21.912
Sheep and humans share
96% of the same DNA.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.697
And that could account
for the reason

25:23.765 --> 25:25.532
why the bugs are killing
their human hosts.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.867
But I just called the lab.

25:26.934 --> 25:29.286
They said the bugs they got
from the first victim...

25:29.371 --> 25:31.205
They weren't mature enough
to create the enzyme.

25:31.272 --> 25:34.074
But the bugs got bigger
with the second victim.

25:34.125 --> 25:35.743
- They did?
- Yeah.

25:35.794 --> 25:38.078
Maybe he is modifying his work.

25:38.129 --> 25:39.947
Okay, so say you're right.

25:40.015 --> 25:41.448
- What would he need?
- Like equipment?

25:41.499 --> 25:43.250
Yeah. Call Lincoln.

25:43.301 --> 25:44.752
<i>- Retro-viral samples.</i>
- Retro-viral samples.

25:44.803 --> 25:46.637
<i>- Plasmid array.</i>
- Plasmid array.

25:46.721 --> 25:48.455
<i>- Liquid spectrometer.</i>
- Okay, wait, wait.

25:48.523 --> 25:49.890
- Slow down.
- An electron microscope

25:49.957 --> 25:51.592
and also liquid nitrogen...
You got all that?

25:51.643 --> 25:52.793
All right, I'm leaving now,

25:52.844 --> 25:54.795
so I should be there
in about twenty minutes.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.431
Uh, Lincoln said that if you
were here, he would kiss you.

25:57.482 --> 25:59.266
Well, I'm glad he's not here.

25:59.317 --> 26:00.984
Okay. And you will keep
the list on you.

26:01.069 --> 26:03.103
- Yes, of course, of course. Keys.
- Keys. Yes. Thank you.

26:03.154 --> 26:04.971
And my I.D.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.807
- And you forgot this.
- Oh.

26:09.244 --> 26:11.695
I was gonna wait
till this weekend.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.997
I know we have a lot
to figure out.

26:14.082 --> 26:15.949
There's your job,
and there's my job,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.118
and there's my mother.

26:18.186 --> 26:19.620
Look, being away from you
made me realize

26:19.671 --> 26:23.040
how much I can't stand
being away from you.

26:27.011 --> 26:29.713
Olivia Dunham...

26:29.798 --> 26:31.498
Will you marry me?

26:34.903 --> 26:36.353
Yes.

26:44.312 --> 26:46.230
Seriously?

26:48.450 --> 26:49.650
Hello?

26:49.701 --> 26:51.168
<i>Hey. Where are you?</i>

26:51.236 --> 26:52.319
It's Lincoln.

26:52.370 --> 26:53.570
I'm just leaving the house.
What's up?

26:53.638 --> 26:55.322
<i>Don't come down here.
We got a hit.</i>

26:55.373 --> 26:57.691
Six months ago,
Silva purchased a plasmid array.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.860
He had it shipped
to a warehouse in Brooklyn.

26:59.911 --> 27:04.364
I'm sending you
the address now.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.802
Silva's unit is number 21.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.587
I already walked the perimeter.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.873
No sign of any other cars.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.979
What?

27:19.046 --> 27:21.765
I said yes.

27:21.850 --> 27:23.650
Frank asked me, and I said yes.

27:23.718 --> 27:26.069
And?

27:26.154 --> 27:28.572
You happy?

27:30.158 --> 27:32.359
Yeah. I am.

27:32.410 --> 27:34.445
Good.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.114
Then I am too.

27:58.269 --> 28:00.270
Watch your step.

28:00.355 --> 28:03.056
Thank you.

28:06.110 --> 28:08.779
Hey...

28:11.783 --> 28:14.100
I think someone's here.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.195
Hey!

28:58.279 --> 28:59.863
Hey!

29:02.534 --> 29:04.201
Olivia!

29:04.285 --> 29:06.453
Olivia!

29:06.504 --> 29:09.540
Damn it!

29:09.624 --> 29:11.375
<i>No signal.</i>

29:11.459 --> 29:14.127
<i>Please try again.</i>

29:38.736 --> 29:40.520
Aah!

30:05.206 --> 30:06.874
Where's Lincoln?

30:31.232 --> 30:34.485
Come on,
there's got to be something.

30:34.569 --> 30:36.353
There's got to be...

30:43.311 --> 30:44.495
Yes!

31:03.097 --> 31:05.632
There are more agents
on their way here now.

31:05.683 --> 31:08.185
I think we both know
that's not true.

31:08.269 --> 31:10.854
Come on, do yourself a favor
and just let me go.

31:10.939 --> 31:13.340
They'll thank me.

31:13.391 --> 31:17.528
The whole world...
will thank me.

31:17.612 --> 31:20.030
Thank you for what...
Your vaccine?

31:21.733 --> 31:23.350
Is that what
you're talking about...

31:23.401 --> 31:26.036
Your vaccine?

31:26.120 --> 31:28.038
For someone
who wants to save lives,

31:28.122 --> 31:31.525
you sure don't have much
of a problem killing people.

31:31.576 --> 31:35.295
How many did Salk sacrifice
trying to get his answers...

31:35.363 --> 31:38.832
Pasteur...
In the name of science?

31:38.900 --> 31:41.318
When the sheep died out,

31:41.386 --> 31:44.054
I tried cows, goats, primates.

31:44.138 --> 31:47.307
None of them
could host the beetles.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.393
Humans were my only option.

31:49.477 --> 31:51.478
What about stopping
the research?

31:51.546 --> 31:54.648
- That wasn't an option?
- No.

31:54.715 --> 31:57.851
Because I was too close.

31:57.902 --> 32:00.153
And now...

32:02.907 --> 32:05.058
Now I'm...

32:05.109 --> 32:09.780
My work is...
is nearly complete.

32:16.421 --> 32:19.756
Did you ever ask yourself
what you're leaving behind?

32:22.460 --> 32:24.928
I have an ability.

32:27.515 --> 32:29.499
I was on a path.

32:29.567 --> 32:32.386
I had a calling,

32:32.437 --> 32:34.938
and the world changed on me.

32:35.023 --> 32:39.776
It simply... changed and
robbed me of my legacy.

32:39.861 --> 32:43.030
This... world,

32:43.097 --> 32:45.699
this decaying madness...

32:48.736 --> 32:50.437
Robbed me.

32:52.824 --> 32:54.741
Come on.

33:23.988 --> 33:26.306
This is Agent Lee.

33:26.357 --> 33:29.643
I need a tactical unit
immediately at my location.

33:29.694 --> 33:32.079
See, the second batch
of specimen

33:32.146 --> 33:34.448
were almost mature enough,
but not quite.

33:34.499 --> 33:38.485
And then I realized...

33:38.536 --> 33:41.755
A queen can hatch her own eggs.

33:41.822 --> 33:45.992
She can create a legion,
enough for my vaccine.

33:47.962 --> 33:54.267
One more human host...
to bring the queen beetle to term.

33:54.335 --> 33:59.973
But it's over now,
'cause we know who you are.

34:00.024 --> 34:03.009
You don't understand.

34:03.061 --> 34:06.229
The gestation
has already begun.

34:12.203 --> 34:16.123
What did you give me?

34:16.190 --> 34:19.025
What the hell did you give me?

34:22.246 --> 34:24.297
Don't move!

34:24.364 --> 34:25.632
Lincoln.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.135
- Lincoln, don't shoot him.
- That's up to him.

34:28.202 --> 34:30.137
No. We need his help.

34:30.204 --> 34:31.838
I've been infected.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.380
Don't worry, Liv.

34:42.431 --> 34:44.766
I'm gonna take care of you.

34:46.319 --> 34:48.402
Down! Now!

34:48.487 --> 34:50.072
Down!

34:50.156 --> 34:52.074
- Olivia!
- Frank!

34:52.158 --> 34:53.275
Oh, Frank, Frank.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.409
He dosed her.

34:54.494 --> 34:56.277
Oh, Frank, he made me
drink the water.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.910
Somebody bag that glass!

34:58.933 --> 35:00.582
What do we do...
to stop the infestation?

35:00.666 --> 35:02.951
What do we do to stop it?

35:03.036 --> 35:04.286
- Get her to the hospital.
- Let me go!

35:04.370 --> 35:05.787
Get her to the hospital.
You're running out of time.

35:05.872 --> 35:08.006
Go. Go!

35:09.792 --> 35:11.593
She's been infected
with a deadly parasite.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.011
The next ten minutes
are critical.

35:13.079 --> 35:14.679
In my kit,
there's a vial of metrifonate.

35:14.747 --> 35:16.298
It's an anti-parasitic.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.432
- Liv.
- Yeah.

35:17.517 --> 35:19.084
I'm gonna do everything I can.
Just hold on.

35:19.135 --> 35:20.268
Everybody out...

35:20.353 --> 35:21.686
Now!

35:30.563 --> 35:32.481
Tell me how to save her.

35:35.651 --> 35:36.868
Oh...

35:36.936 --> 35:39.821
You have one more chance.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.081
Tell me!

35:51.283 --> 35:52.834
If you want
your friend to live,

35:52.919 --> 35:56.088
put down the gun
and do exactly as I say.

35:58.791 --> 35:59.791
Aah!

36:02.562 --> 36:03.795
What do you want?

36:03.846 --> 36:07.432
Bring me those panels
over there...

36:07.483 --> 36:10.769
And I'll tell you
how to save your friend.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.738
B.P.'S 140 over 90.

36:13.806 --> 36:15.974
Heart rate's elevated.

36:16.025 --> 36:17.159
That could just be
the adrenaline.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.077
Oh, Frank, my stomach...

36:19.145 --> 36:21.146
The anti-parasitic that
I'm going to give you is powerful.

36:21.197 --> 36:22.998
It's gonna kill the bugs
inside you before they hatch.

36:23.082 --> 36:25.867
Why do I sense that
there's a "but" coming?

36:25.952 --> 36:28.170
Because it's a lot
for your system to take.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.671
Uh-huh.
So what do we do?

36:29.755 --> 36:32.090
I don't think we have a choice.

36:33.993 --> 36:35.844
Hand me the wand.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.551
Can you zoom in?
What do you see, Frank?

36:45.021 --> 36:46.104
I see movement!

36:46.172 --> 36:48.140
Where?

36:51.477 --> 36:52.894
What the hell
am I putting together here?

36:52.979 --> 36:55.113
You'll work faster
if you don't talk.

37:08.027 --> 37:10.195
I gave you what you wanted.

37:10.246 --> 37:13.165
Now you tell me
how to save her.

37:14.584 --> 37:17.919
She doesn't need saving.

37:18.004 --> 37:19.671
I didn't infect her.

37:19.722 --> 37:22.174
- Uh-uh. She was sick.
- Not because of me.

37:22.225 --> 37:25.060
She's not the final host.

37:26.262 --> 37:28.897
Aah!

37:28.981 --> 37:30.015
Oh!

37:31.767 --> 37:32.901
Syringe is ready.

37:34.553 --> 37:37.322
- Look at me. It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.277
- Stop!
- What?

37:42.361 --> 37:43.778
Take a look at this.

37:43.863 --> 37:45.063
What is it? What is it?

37:45.114 --> 37:46.281
Are you sure?

37:46.365 --> 37:48.283
Look at the beta HCG levels
in her blood.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.919
- The picture on the sonogram...
- Uh-huh?

37:51.003 --> 37:53.421
You're not infected.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.509
You're pregnant.

38:05.084 --> 38:08.053
I've done it.

38:10.690 --> 38:14.559
The queen is ready.

38:17.580 --> 38:19.814
Uhh...

38:19.899 --> 38:22.234
Aah!

38:39.702 --> 38:41.836
Come here.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.880
Make sure...

38:51.948 --> 38:54.266
they...

38:56.468 --> 39:02.140
spell my name... right.

39:18.274 --> 39:21.826
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

39:30.169 --> 39:32.320
What did the doctor say?

39:37.009 --> 39:38.593
That the baby's healthy

39:38.661 --> 39:41.679
and that the, uh...
The fall and the adrenaline

39:41.731 --> 39:44.899
triggered some kind
of morning sickness.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.848
How far along are you?

40:02.468 --> 40:04.419
Frank...

40:04.503 --> 40:07.138
Liv, how long
you been pregnant?

40:12.795 --> 40:15.130
Six weeks.

40:22.388 --> 40:25.123
Are you in love with him...

40:25.191 --> 40:26.858
The father?

40:38.587 --> 40:41.373
That's all I needed to know.

40:45.378 --> 40:46.294
Frank.

40:46.379 --> 40:51.516
You... were gonna marry me.

41:28.804 --> 41:29.971
Hello?

41:30.055 --> 41:31.306
<i>Mr. Secretary,</i>

41:31.390 --> 41:32.974
<i>there's been a development.</i>

41:33.058 --> 41:34.676
<i>I think I might have
another way</i>

41:34.760 --> 41:38.012
<i>to bring Peter back
from the other universe.</i>

42:18.721 --> 42:20.355
Sir.

42:20.422 --> 42:21.739
Forgive my intrusion.

42:21.807 --> 42:25.343
I hope this isn't a bad time.

42:25.394 --> 42:27.979
Please come in.

42:39.525 --> 42:42.277
I heard the news
about your pregnancy.

42:44.814 --> 42:46.998
Don't worry.

42:47.049 --> 42:51.002
Your position with Fringe Division
will remain intact.

42:51.070 --> 42:54.088
You'll have whatever
resources you need.

42:57.209 --> 42:59.710
After all,

42:59.762 --> 43:02.680
you are the mother
of my future grandchild.
