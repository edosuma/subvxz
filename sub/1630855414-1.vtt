01:24.256 --> 01:25.154
Hey!

01:57.531 --> 01:58.739
I got you.

01:59.326 --> 02:00.568
Come with me.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.186
Scared?

03:09.706 --> 03:10.776
It's okay.

03:11.605 --> 03:12.847
I know you are.

03:13.779 --> 03:15.298
A little.

03:16.955 --> 03:18.957
It's understandable.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.857
This is a big weekend for you.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.586
- Turkey sandwich with pickles.
- Thank you.

03:27.586 --> 03:31.176
Waffles with extra syrup
for the growing boy.

03:31.314 --> 03:32.626
- Man.
- Hm?

03:32.695 --> 03:33.385
Grown man.

03:33.661 --> 03:36.077
I stand corrected.

03:48.745 --> 03:49.919
Can I get y'all anything?

03:49.919 --> 03:50.920
I'll have a coffee.

03:59.204 --> 04:00.861
Don't shy away.

04:01.379 --> 04:04.071
You meet her gaze with
an even stronger gaze.

04:07.592 --> 04:10.422
Women's gaze is a test, Son.

04:11.423 --> 04:13.529
she says more with her eyes
than she ever would

04:13.529 --> 04:15.496
with any words that come
out of her mouth.

04:19.430 --> 04:20.363
You serious right now?

04:22.192 --> 04:23.849
What, you think
I'm fucking blind?

04:24.367 --> 04:24.988
Tessa! You know what?
I don't need this shit.

04:25.472 --> 04:27.059
You know what? I don't
need this shit. Fuck you.

04:27.370 --> 04:28.233
Fuck you.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.408
I just smiled.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.038
Hey.

04:40.487 --> 04:41.902
Are- Are you okay?

04:42.903 --> 04:43.800
Fine.

04:43.835 --> 04:46.078
Just a disagreement, that's all.

04:46.941 --> 04:49.289
Hey, why don't you come join us?

04:52.568 --> 04:54.224
Sure.

04:55.916 --> 04:57.780
C'mon

04:59.402 --> 05:00.507
I'm Cassandra.

05:00.576 --> 05:01.439
I'm Jackson.

05:01.473 --> 05:04.062
And this is my dad. Carter.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.651
Thank you.

05:08.998 --> 05:11.725
So what happened?

05:13.934 --> 05:15.487
Tessa

05:16.523 --> 05:19.249
saw me smiling at you,
and she got pissed.

05:20.147 --> 05:23.978
She's very passionate
and very possessive.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.153
You two are a couple?

05:27.775 --> 05:29.087
Well, we were.

05:29.812 --> 05:32.401
We just got back from our
trip from Greece.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.506
It was heaven.

05:36.819 --> 05:38.959
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:40.857 --> 05:43.101
Well, I guess now,
you know, I mean.

05:43.964 --> 05:44.999
You're free.

05:45.690 --> 05:46.656
Right? Yeah,

05:47.105 --> 05:48.451
I'm free now.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.937
At least until
school starts again.

05:52.835 --> 05:55.113
I teach Greek
history at Piedmont.

05:55.665 --> 05:56.356
No way.

05:57.046 --> 05:57.667
No, uh-

05:58.012 --> 05:59.324
I'm starting
in a few weeks.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.775
Oh. Congratulations.

06:02.707 --> 06:04.053
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

06:04.122 --> 06:06.158
That's what I keep telling him.

06:06.642 --> 06:09.127
And it's all going to start
right after our hunt.

06:10.818 --> 06:11.474
Oh?

06:12.855 --> 06:15.167
You guys looking to bag
some quail or something?

06:16.721 --> 06:17.894
Something like that.

06:17.929 --> 06:19.551
I think that's great.

06:21.277 --> 06:24.038
Father and son having
some male bonding time.

06:25.005 --> 06:27.145
It's kind of an endangered
activity these days.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.561
I wish more women
thought the way you did.

06:29.837 --> 06:31.667
I'm sure your wife gets it.

06:34.739 --> 06:37.535
My- My mom died right
after I was born.

06:37.845 --> 06:38.536
So...

06:39.778 --> 06:41.193
I'm really sorry.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.161
No, it's okay. Um,

06:43.782 --> 06:46.095
My dad's given me everything
I've ever needed.

06:46.682 --> 06:47.199
Really.

06:48.891 --> 06:50.513
I mean, I hope I taught him

06:50.513 --> 06:52.929
everything he needs
to move forward in his life.

06:53.861 --> 06:56.105
Especially the cardinal rule
about the hunt.

06:56.243 --> 06:58.901
Never get too emotional
or close to your prey.

07:03.008 --> 07:05.839
Oh, here's for both.

07:07.979 --> 07:10.775
You, sir, are a gentleman.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.435
That's another important lesson
you can learn from your dad.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.298
How to treat a lady.

07:22.303 --> 07:24.616
So, um, where you headed
after this?

07:24.789 --> 07:26.446
Nowhere in particular,

07:27.619 --> 07:28.965
not much to boot.

07:29.828 --> 07:32.141
But, I'll make do.

07:35.075 --> 07:37.249
Um,
Cassandra...

07:38.319 --> 07:41.599
We're going to our hunt,
and we were thinking.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.048
Why don't you come with?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.947
The cabins are a little rustic.

07:44.981 --> 07:47.605
You know, but they're nice
and they're private.

07:47.605 --> 07:48.571
You'd have your own.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.504
There's a really nice beach.

07:50.815 --> 07:52.955
I like what I'm hearing so far.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.612
You haven't heard
the best thing.

07:54.612 --> 07:58.478
Each participant has a
chance at winning $100,000.

07:59.617 --> 08:01.446
And when you say participant,

08:01.446 --> 08:03.793
does that potentially
include me?

08:04.656 --> 08:06.347
I don't see why not.

08:06.831 --> 08:07.487
Of course,

08:07.866 --> 08:09.489
some of us have been
doing it quite a while,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.698
so you might be at a
slight disadvantage.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.182
I'll take my chances.

08:14.942 --> 08:16.634
I will go anywhere
there's a beach.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.706
-Okay.
-Yeah?

08:19.809 --> 08:21.984
Yeah. As long as you
get me back by Monday.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.848
Well, we will.
We're gentlemen.

08:23.848 --> 08:24.331
-Yeah.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.540
- Okay
- You good?

08:26.609 --> 08:27.196
Yeah.

08:29.957 --> 08:31.027
- Road trip.
- So fun.

08:31.096 --> 08:32.477
Let's go.

08:33.202 --> 08:34.823
It's my first time. So.

08:34.823 --> 08:36.032
Both of our first times.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.171
- Great!
- Yeah.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.712
Gentlemen, glad
you could make it

09:01.644 --> 09:02.714
Alright.

09:04.026 --> 09:04.371
Hey.

09:04.889 --> 09:05.614
Do you think there would
be any way

09:05.752 --> 09:07.063
that we'd miss
your boys first hunt?

09:07.063 --> 09:08.168
No way, man.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.238
Ain't nothing like it.

09:10.411 --> 09:11.689
Your stones won't even
fit in your shorts

09:11.689 --> 09:13.000
by the time we're
finished with you.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.728
This is, what,
your third hunt?

09:16.832 --> 09:17.349
Fifth.

09:17.418 --> 09:17.902
Fifth.

09:18.419 --> 09:19.731
Hell I'd do this every
weekend if I could.

09:21.422 --> 09:23.114
Oh, this is Cassandra.

09:23.183 --> 09:25.081
- She's going to be joining us
for Jackson's Hunt. - Hey.

09:25.116 --> 09:27.601
Well, Cassandra, it's
nice to meet you.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.672
Oh, Teddy, this is my
brother Preston right here.

09:29.707 --> 09:31.916
And this lovely lady
right here is Lexi.

09:31.950 --> 09:34.228
We call her our new friend
with an old soul.

09:35.471 --> 09:37.438
Yeah, well, we met
Cassandra at the diner.

09:37.438 --> 09:39.579
She, uh, she got stranded
by her friend.

09:41.201 --> 09:42.720
Oh, how fortuitous.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.686
uh huh.

09:44.135 --> 09:46.171
I do believe
everything happens for a reason.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.104
All right, let's
get on that boat.

09:48.104 --> 09:49.727
Yeah.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.353
Did you really just
meet them in a diner?

09:55.387 --> 09:56.216
Yeah.

09:56.768 --> 09:58.736
I got stranded and
just bumped into them.

09:59.184 --> 10:00.530
What about you?

10:01.221 --> 10:02.532
Online.

10:02.809 --> 10:04.569
Starvingstudents-dot-com,

10:05.052 --> 10:07.192
trying to gather
my college tuition.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.367
A hundred k could go a long way.

10:12.163 --> 10:14.234
Taking money from rich men.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.099
Perfect picture of
third wave feminism.

10:18.065 --> 10:20.723
Some chicks think that grinding
on a pole gives them power.

10:20.758 --> 10:23.277
For me, the grass
would be greener

10:23.415 --> 10:25.314
when my bank account is too.

10:26.004 --> 10:28.075
It's not like the perks suck -

10:28.835 --> 10:30.630
free food, free drinks,

10:31.251 --> 10:33.736
beaches, cute boys.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.326
I'm old enough to be his mother.

10:37.395 --> 10:38.154
Yeah.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.880
If you were like,
12 when you had him.

10:40.847 --> 10:43.332
Hey, at least he's
got one parent.

10:43.366 --> 10:45.645
It's more than
some of us can say.

10:46.784 --> 10:47.474
Hey!

10:48.130 --> 10:48.889
Thank you.

10:57.622 --> 10:58.761
Go untie us.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.387
Conrad. Williams.

11:38.801 --> 11:39.837
I enjoyed your profiles,

11:39.940 --> 11:41.735
especially the part about
what brought you out here.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.495
We're just honored to be
accepted in the club, sir.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.565
We're raring to go.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.463
Boo yeah!

11:46.360 --> 11:47.499
Oh, I can see that.

11:51.365 --> 11:53.436
Cassandra, this is
Conrad and Williams.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.508
This is their first time, too.
This is James.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.234
He and Bob are not only
caretakers,

11:58.234 --> 11:59.960
they're also
avid hunters themselves.

12:00.478 --> 12:01.824
Is this the New Zealand.

12:01.859 --> 12:03.481
Yes sir. It's the Shiraz.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.000
Thank you.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.658
Wow, this is fantastic.

12:09.176 --> 12:10.868
Nothing but the
best for our guests.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.766
Wait til you try
his cuisine later.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.010
He wouldn't be trying to
fatten us up for the slaughter

12:15.010 --> 12:15.735
would you?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.669
Come on, Jackson,
let's go check out the beach.

12:20.015 --> 12:21.602
See ya, dad.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.272
It's not Greece, but.

12:36.341 --> 12:38.378
No, it's perfect.

12:40.035 --> 12:41.450
Have you been here before?

12:41.484 --> 12:44.453
No, dad didn't take
me until I was old enough.

12:45.454 --> 12:47.214
He talks about it all the time.

12:47.249 --> 12:50.942
And says it's like
the best thing since.

12:51.598 --> 12:54.256
- Man invented the wheel.
- Yeah.

12:54.359 --> 12:55.705
Something like that.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.261
And how about you?

12:59.261 --> 13:00.849
Is it all that to you?

13:04.059 --> 13:05.888
You know, Jackson,

13:06.130 --> 13:08.063
whatever it is you
do on this hunt,

13:08.891 --> 13:11.135
it's not what makes you a man.

13:12.170 --> 13:16.312
You become a man by recognizing
and following your moral compass

13:16.554 --> 13:18.280
not by killing some animal.

13:20.489 --> 13:21.939
Yeah, yeah, I know, but.

13:22.284 --> 13:23.423
But, um...

13:23.975 --> 13:26.081
But my dad said
it's the first step.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.774
Well, the first step is learning
how to make your own decisions.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.592
A little bit muggy, eh?

13:54.626 --> 13:56.007
How about you?

13:56.456 --> 13:58.458
All right, cool.

13:59.114 --> 13:59.977
So clear.

14:00.011 --> 14:02.048
You can almost see the heavens.

14:02.117 --> 14:03.877
Perfect conditions for a hunt.

14:03.946 --> 14:05.845
How many teams
you got going out?

14:07.536 --> 14:08.951
Teddy and Preston.

14:10.194 --> 14:11.505
Couple of new guys
from Wall Street.

14:12.990 --> 14:14.336
Oh, and Jackson.

14:14.336 --> 14:16.372
Oh, your boy's
punching his V-card.

14:16.407 --> 14:17.546
What's the over/under?

14:17.615 --> 14:19.444
3 hours for a kill.

14:21.239 --> 14:22.654
You're going to take a position.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.966
You better believe it.

14:24.173 --> 14:26.210
Next best thing to being there.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.803
Find anything in her cabin.

14:34.563 --> 14:36.013
No, didn't find shit.

14:36.013 --> 14:36.979
Nothing.

14:38.049 --> 14:39.706
Thanks for checking.

14:40.017 --> 14:41.259
Sorry about my paranoia.

14:41.259 --> 14:43.848
She just seemed a
little familiar.

14:45.194 --> 14:46.126
Familiar?

14:46.575 --> 14:47.334
Yeah.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.370
Yeah, well, after a while,

14:48.370 --> 14:50.372
they all sort of look alike,
you know?

15:21.541 --> 15:22.611
We should go start the bonfire.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.751
We'll meet down there shortly.

15:30.757 --> 15:31.792
How's your cabin?

15:31.792 --> 15:33.208
Perfect.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.968
Shower was amazing.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.176
Hmm.

15:36.763 --> 15:38.213
What's that you're drinking?

15:38.213 --> 15:40.215
- Petrus Pomerol. 2014.

15:40.249 --> 15:41.043
Oh.

15:41.216 --> 15:43.390
Sounds expensive.

15:44.253 --> 15:46.152
- Thousand dollars a bottle.
- Wow.

15:46.497 --> 15:50.121
James, glass for our guest.

15:50.708 --> 15:53.642
Oh, wow. Thank you.

15:57.508 --> 16:00.304
Rules a little flexible
for the underage drinker.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.720
When your dad's the owner.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.101
That's the last glass.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.792
Don't want you
sloppy on the field.

16:06.241 --> 16:07.242
Yes, sir.

16:14.283 --> 16:15.250
The others,

16:15.250 --> 16:17.148
are they club members?

16:20.807 --> 16:23.603
They're sportsmen who enjoy
the true meaning of the hunt,

16:23.775 --> 16:25.743
and the valuable
life lessons it affords.

16:26.675 --> 16:28.988
I see a lot of trophies.

16:29.505 --> 16:31.680
But why the masks?

16:32.508 --> 16:34.994
We celebrate the hunt
in a different way.

16:36.202 --> 16:38.618
The experience itself
that makes it sacred.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.758
Well,

16:41.966 --> 16:44.934
when you put it that way,
it almost sounds beautiful.

16:46.212 --> 16:48.800
Makes you appreciate
what they sacrificed.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.458
You're a fascinating woman,

16:54.151 --> 16:56.015
Cheers.

17:07.542 --> 17:10.443
You want to be drinking
so much around these guys?

17:10.546 --> 17:11.685
Oh, please.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.204
I've taken care of
myself my whole life.

17:14.136 --> 17:16.828
Couple of preppies pitching
tents in their chinos

17:16.828 --> 17:19.452
ain't going to fuck this
girl's shit up.

17:27.493 --> 17:29.048
Come on.

17:38.885 --> 17:40.231
Do you want to dance?

17:42.889 --> 17:43.372
Um...

17:44.201 --> 17:45.616
I'm-I'm not really that good.

17:45.719 --> 17:47.756
Well, I'm happy to teach you.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.207
Not really my
area of expertise,

17:50.207 --> 17:52.209
but I'm not bad.

17:53.210 --> 17:53.900
Okay.

17:55.867 --> 17:56.799
You're so tall.

17:56.972 --> 17:59.043
- I'm really bad at this.
- You're really good.

18:02.391 --> 18:04.186
Oh, you're good.

18:10.537 --> 18:11.711
It's bad.

18:14.921 --> 18:18.718
All right, gentlemen, let's get
these ladies to their rooms.

18:18.752 --> 18:20.582
All right. Got an early morning.

18:20.616 --> 18:21.893
I'm not done.

18:22.618 --> 18:23.861
Get out of here.

18:34.147 --> 18:34.872
Alright.

18:41.292 --> 18:43.881
Look girls, Daddy's home.

18:45.262 --> 18:46.711
Here, take it, take this..

18:47.678 --> 18:49.576
Alright boys, ya'll pick out
what you want.

18:49.576 --> 18:51.509
I like what I see. I like it,
I like it.

18:51.509 --> 18:53.615
C'mon,
I ain't got all day.

18:53.649 --> 18:57.446
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.209
Brown hair.

19:01.726 --> 19:02.762
Blue eyes.

19:02.831 --> 19:04.764
Oh, that's a nice choice.

19:05.282 --> 19:07.180
I want the one with
the green eyes.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.251
- With the green eyes?
- Yeah.

19:09.286 --> 19:11.495
Look at that face,
just yank her ass up.

19:12.323 --> 19:14.739
Come on. I ain't got all day,
brother. Bring her over here.

19:14.774 --> 19:15.637
Come on, now.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.501
Come on, here we go.
Oh yeah.

19:17.501 --> 19:18.433
Here we go, come on.

19:19.296 --> 19:19.951
All right.

19:22.195 --> 19:22.851
Come on.

19:23.921 --> 19:24.853
I get you.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.303
Now this one here.

19:26.648 --> 19:27.683
Go for a little walk.

19:27.752 --> 19:29.168
A little walk.

19:29.996 --> 19:31.273
This one's giving
me a little trouble.

19:31.308 --> 19:33.379
You see how she's behaving.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.760
You know I'm talking
to you, all right.

19:36.002 --> 19:36.830
Look at those teeth.

19:37.659 --> 19:38.798
Look at that, come
over here boy.

19:38.798 --> 19:39.523
Look at her.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.973
All right. You
behave, all right?

19:42.319 --> 19:44.631
Or do you want to see
the whip on your ass?

19:45.667 --> 19:48.359
And then I'm going to sic them
dogs on you.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.810
So you be nice to him, huh?

19:51.535 --> 19:53.330
Loot that, look at
that face. huh?

19:54.020 --> 19:56.195
Wouldn't you like to
take a bite out of that.

19:57.472 --> 19:58.645
Come on.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.132
Come on.

20:08.345 --> 20:10.036
You behave, all right.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.073
You got 30 minutes
of a head start.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.247
Then we come after you,

20:14.247 --> 20:16.698
and if you come back to camp
before the 24 hour period.

20:16.698 --> 20:18.734
Virgil and the
dogs will get you.

20:19.701 --> 20:20.943
So should we get started?

20:20.978 --> 20:25.051
I think we're still missing
Teddy, Preston, and your boy.

20:25.534 --> 20:26.846
Want me to go round them up?

20:29.504 --> 20:31.160
The hunt has started, so...

20:31.678 --> 20:32.507
we will, too.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.249
Let's go. Go!

20:52.561 --> 20:53.597
Come.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.840
Come one girls. Looking out.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.083
Come on girl.

21:07.438 --> 21:10.199
Gentlemen, let me
ask you a question.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.272
When's the last time you heard
the word masculinity,

21:13.617 --> 21:16.413
without the word
toxic attached to it?

21:16.758 --> 21:17.724
Yeah, right.

21:17.862 --> 21:19.139
Life is a jungle.

21:19.139 --> 21:22.971
For hundreds of years, we
were the alphas of that jungle,

21:23.385 --> 21:25.249
the apex predators.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.078
Today, men
everywhere, they're...

21:27.078 --> 21:29.149
they're being emasculated,

21:29.771 --> 21:33.326
castigated, and in some
cases literally castrated,

21:33.671 --> 21:37.434
all for the ostensible sin of
being born with a Y chromosome.

21:37.675 --> 21:38.918
Preach it, brother!

21:38.952 --> 21:42.956
That's provided our gender's
a given and inalienable right.

21:43.232 --> 21:44.820
If you ask too
many people today,

21:45.787 --> 21:50.136
we don't even technically
or biologically exist.

21:50.447 --> 21:52.483
We're a choice.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.451
A social construct.

21:54.830 --> 21:57.246
All this is being
done in the name of

21:57.730 --> 21:59.283
equality.

22:02.079 --> 22:04.253
But do you sense that...

22:06.359 --> 22:08.637
being equal is the objective?

22:08.706 --> 22:10.121
Hell, no. No way.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.710
So I want to know
why you're here.

22:12.779 --> 22:14.816
What brought you
to the hunt club?

22:14.816 --> 22:17.301
And how are you going to
reclaim your masculinity?

22:18.198 --> 22:19.786
Welcome to the castle.

22:19.821 --> 22:22.168
This is where the magic happens.
- Watch your step!

22:22.168 --> 22:22.962
You're gonna...

22:22.962 --> 22:23.894
You're gonna like this.

22:23.963 --> 22:26.103
Hey, watch your hands buddy!

22:26.897 --> 22:29.348
Look, I think you guys
know my name is Conrad,

22:30.141 --> 22:32.489
this my brother from
another mother, Williams.

22:32.696 --> 22:34.491
The two of us run a hedge fund.

22:34.491 --> 22:35.871
Correction. Used to.

22:37.010 --> 22:38.633
Say, we used to be alpha males.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.117
That's how it works
in the finance world.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.498
It's dog eat dog.

22:41.532 --> 22:44.570
So one day HR comes in,

22:44.570 --> 22:47.331
says, I can't take
a meeting in my office

22:47.331 --> 22:49.402
unless I have a woman present
taking notes.

22:49.471 --> 22:51.128
And I got to leave
the door open.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.232
- Bullshit.
- Right.

22:52.543 --> 22:55.028
And then if I want to go have
drinks with my fellow coworkers,

22:55.408 --> 22:57.583
I got to be late to arrive
and leave early.

22:57.617 --> 23:00.862
So they see with witnesses that
I didn't take somebody home.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.658
I mean, this shit's actually
printed in the fucking HR

23:03.658 --> 23:04.175
handbook.

23:04.175 --> 23:04.935
So what?

23:05.107 --> 23:06.315
Now, we're supposed
to go through life

23:06.315 --> 23:07.731
with a tagalong woman?

23:12.736 --> 23:14.669
Making sure that we're not
doing something

23:14.669 --> 23:15.842
wrong with another woman?

23:16.533 --> 23:17.706
It's fucking ridiculous. Yeah.

23:17.741 --> 23:19.156
Yeah. So we said, fuck that shit

23:19.259 --> 23:20.399
And they fired our asses.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.021
They fired our fucking asses.

23:22.090 --> 23:23.194
I mean, when did
women start

23:23.194 --> 23:24.575
telling us how
to act like men,

23:24.920 --> 23:25.542
right?

23:25.921 --> 23:28.407
I mean, we are men.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.755
We are primal,
strong, sexual beings.

23:31.893 --> 23:34.274
We used to be the stronger sex.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.553
We asserted our dominance.

23:36.691 --> 23:38.417
Wait, I'm getting dizzy.

23:39.901 --> 23:41.661
Oh my god.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.077
Right.

23:44.112 --> 23:46.079
So we are reclaiming
our biology, right here.

23:46.252 --> 23:47.253
Right fucking now.
Fuck, yeah, Fuck, yeah.

23:47.253 --> 23:48.288
- Fuck, yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

23:48.772 --> 23:49.945
Thank you, thank you.

23:50.808 --> 23:52.879
for that cathartic input.

23:53.639 --> 23:54.881
Now, as for me, I

23:55.088 --> 23:57.505
agree with everything you
gentlemen just said.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.231
Do you want to know why?

24:01.370 --> 24:03.269
Because just as in nature,

24:03.303 --> 24:07.238
the hunt is the ultimate
act of supremacy.

24:10.863 --> 24:11.657
Oh, okay.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.624
Take it easy, guys.

24:13.659 --> 24:16.385
This is going to go a lot easier
if you don't fight.

24:20.769 --> 24:22.012
As head of the hunt club,

24:22.081 --> 24:24.877
I'm connected to some
very powerful men.

24:26.119 --> 24:29.191
Hey. Yes, they made me a
lot of money over the years,

24:29.191 --> 24:31.504
but that's not the only thing
I'm grateful for.

24:31.849 --> 24:33.472
They have showed me

24:34.162 --> 24:36.129
why God put me on this earth.

24:36.164 --> 24:39.339
It was to help other men
reclaim their masculinity,

24:39.616 --> 24:41.583
to go back to the way
things were before.

24:41.618 --> 24:43.102
-Yeah,
- Yes. - Yes.

24:43.136 --> 24:45.553
Not just for us,

24:46.588 --> 24:49.280
for future men, for our sons.

24:49.971 --> 24:52.421
My son grew up without his mom.

24:52.421 --> 24:55.977
And... my wife,
she was amazing.

24:56.011 --> 24:59.325
She would have showed my son
where the line was drawn

25:00.015 --> 25:03.294
between men and women,
but without her steadying hand,

25:03.294 --> 25:04.882
and me having

25:04.951 --> 25:06.815
to work around the clock
to try and provide.

25:07.644 --> 25:09.922
Jackson lost his way.

25:14.961 --> 25:15.928
About

25:16.860 --> 25:18.689
six months ago, I uh...

25:19.552 --> 25:21.209
I got off work early,

25:21.450 --> 25:23.211
went into Jackson's room,

25:23.211 --> 25:26.663
trying to look around
while he was at a rehearsal.

25:27.215 --> 25:30.598
There in middle of his
closet was a corset.

25:32.082 --> 25:34.878
He hasn't even had
a girlfriend yet.

25:34.912 --> 25:38.191
Well, I guess I'm not
your average woman.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.505
Yeah, I figure that much.

25:45.198 --> 25:47.925
Lexi said that she met Teddy
and Preston

25:47.925 --> 25:50.479
on a website
for starving students.

25:50.652 --> 25:52.551
Did they tell you
anything about that?

25:53.966 --> 25:54.863
They don't,

25:55.070 --> 25:58.349
they don't really tell me
too much around here.

26:01.870 --> 26:04.493
What about the girls
that came here before?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.841
Do you know anything about them?

26:09.222 --> 26:11.880
And you know, you
don't have to do this.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.779
You can back out at any time.

26:13.779 --> 26:14.538
Tch.

26:15.884 --> 26:18.404
I don't, I don't
think you get it.

26:19.854 --> 26:21.580
I don't, I don't
have a choice. I,

26:21.580 --> 26:23.202
I, I have to....

26:26.239 --> 26:27.758
Never mind. I'm,

26:28.345 --> 26:29.864
I'm sorry.

26:33.039 --> 26:35.145
You know, back in my day,

26:35.145 --> 26:38.458
my dad, he would take me out
and give me a whipping for that.

26:38.769 --> 26:41.254
It's not like we didn't see
our fair share that shit.

26:41.254 --> 26:43.774
I mean, some women in
college, I mean,

26:43.774 --> 26:45.776
they weren't
gay and then they wash

26:45.776 --> 26:48.054
the purple out of their
hair, got married and

26:48.054 --> 26:50.160
settle down, for Christ's sake.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.507
I mean, these kids today,
- Right, right.

26:52.507 --> 26:54.302
their foundation, the very core
of their essence,

26:54.302 --> 26:56.166
is being warped.

26:56.304 --> 26:57.443
And there's no difference
between men and women.

26:57.443 --> 26:58.996
Well the fuck there
is. I'm a man.

26:59.065 --> 27:00.653
And that's my identity.

27:00.964 --> 27:01.930
- Fuck Yeah.
- Yes.

27:02.103 --> 27:04.415
And in a couple hours,
it's going to be my son's, too.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.314
I could take him to
a million therapists.

27:06.348 --> 27:09.558
I could beg with
him, plead, argue,

27:10.283 --> 27:13.114
but with one shot, one hunter's

27:13.114 --> 27:16.635
rifle, or a bolt
from the crossbow,

27:17.187 --> 27:22.088
he can feel the raw,
primal power of masculinity.

27:22.261 --> 27:24.090
He can become a man.

27:24.470 --> 27:28.094
You men, you men are blessed
to be a part of this Hunt Club,

27:28.094 --> 27:31.201
to be able to reclaim
your manhood, to feel what

27:31.201 --> 27:33.997
it's like to be the top
of the food chain again.

27:34.756 --> 27:35.999
Conrad. Williams.

27:36.965 --> 27:38.104
Your hunt is on.

27:39.796 --> 27:41.280
If we make it to the shoreline.

27:41.314 --> 27:42.971
I think we can beat them.

27:43.006 --> 27:45.491
You sure? Don't you think he...

27:45.629 --> 27:48.390
I've been counting in my head.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.945
We should have nearly
10 minutes left.

27:53.948 --> 27:54.845
Woo!

27:55.466 --> 27:57.296
- You boys ready?
- Fuck yeah.

27:57.330 --> 27:57.986
Let's do it.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.679
- Well, let's go.
- Yeah. Woo!

28:01.058 --> 28:02.853
Hunt, hunt.

28:02.888 --> 28:06.685
Hunt, hunt, hunt,
hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt,

28:07.306 --> 28:08.445
Yeah!

28:08.445 --> 28:09.964
hunt, hunt, hunt,
hunt. Let's go!

28:09.998 --> 28:11.103
Come on!

28:12.518 --> 28:14.485
If we can just get to the shore.

28:14.623 --> 28:17.799
Ahhh!

28:21.009 --> 28:25.220
You can do it.
Remember you're strong.

28:25.842 --> 28:28.051
We can still make
it out of here.

28:39.648 --> 28:42.168
Jesus fucking christ!

28:42.341 --> 28:43.722
Come on, come on!

28:44.032 --> 28:45.585
Come on, come on!

28:47.242 --> 28:49.728
I can't...it hurts too much!

28:51.246 --> 28:53.662
Listen. They cannot win.

28:53.870 --> 28:55.181
We can't let them.

28:55.216 --> 28:56.804
Understand?

29:00.600 --> 29:04.397
Now give me...
a good push.

29:04.846 --> 29:05.778
On three.

29:05.847 --> 29:10.818
One, two, three!

29:18.722 --> 29:20.551
Come one, we got to move.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.381
Now. Now!

29:26.903 --> 29:28.283
Let's go get them.

29:28.318 --> 29:30.872
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

29:31.631 --> 29:33.392
I can't. I can't

29:33.392 --> 29:35.221
Go on without me.

29:35.256 --> 29:37.223
I'm not leaving you.

29:46.612 --> 29:51.134
We're almost here.
Here.

30:04.492 --> 30:06.874
I think we lost-

30:10.670 --> 30:14.088
Oh my god! Oh my god!

30:14.571 --> 30:17.229
Oh my god. Oh my god.

30:19.956 --> 30:22.579
Oh. Oh. Oh my god.

30:25.962 --> 30:27.204
Okay, wait.
Wait I can help you.

30:27.204 --> 30:28.965
I can help you. I
have information.

30:28.965 --> 30:30.345
I have information.

30:30.483 --> 30:32.658
Okay, Shhh.

30:37.490 --> 30:38.595
Are you thirsty?

30:38.629 --> 30:40.079
Mm hm.

30:42.012 --> 30:42.944
Here we go.

30:42.979 --> 30:44.808
Here we go.

30:47.466 --> 30:51.470
Here we go. Shh Shh.

30:52.540 --> 30:54.128
It's okay.

30:55.370 --> 30:57.545
Lacie, she-
-Don't, no, no...

30:58.166 --> 31:00.479
The animals don't have names.

31:00.962 --> 31:02.136
Describe her to me.

31:02.412 --> 31:05.518
The, the girl.
The black girl, she's...

31:05.864 --> 31:07.727
You'll let me go if I tell you?

31:07.727 --> 31:08.659
Of course.

31:08.694 --> 31:09.971
You have my word.

31:12.353 --> 31:13.906
She she's making a weapon.

31:13.975 --> 31:16.978
A shank from, from a
bone from our food.

31:17.013 --> 31:18.014
She's. She's sharpening it.

31:18.014 --> 31:19.187
Where does she hide it?

31:19.222 --> 31:20.016
In her bra.

31:20.016 --> 31:22.018
It's not that big.

31:22.052 --> 31:24.089
What does she plan
to do with it?

31:24.158 --> 31:26.574
Escape? Attack one of us?

31:26.608 --> 31:28.231
She didn't mention it.
She just,

31:28.334 --> 31:31.234
all she said was that she wasn't
going to be a victim anymore.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.378
Tell the others.

31:41.071 --> 31:44.868
Please, I don't want to die.

31:45.110 --> 31:47.353
I told you what you wanted.

31:47.526 --> 31:50.736
- Please just let me go?
- You did good.

31:50.736 --> 31:52.151
You did real good.

31:53.601 --> 31:55.534
Now, I just got one
thing to tell you.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.881
Wh-what?

31:58.261 --> 31:59.089
Run.

32:17.004 --> 32:20.076
Ratting out her friends like all
those other spineless bitches.

32:20.076 --> 32:21.077
Fuck her.

32:21.077 --> 32:23.286
Exactly. Fuck her.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.013
Let's get rid of this.

32:28.153 --> 32:30.189
Oh, you got a heavy one.

32:30.224 --> 32:31.639
Nice.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.891
Your tattoo.

32:43.789 --> 32:46.240
It's just like your
friend's, right?

32:46.757 --> 32:47.275
Yeah.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.002
You're very observant.

32:50.071 --> 32:51.072
You get them in Greece?

32:51.107 --> 32:52.901
Yeah. It was Tess's design.

32:53.281 --> 32:55.456
She must be really
important to you.

32:55.801 --> 32:57.837
Well, she saved my life.

33:00.357 --> 33:02.083
What happened?

33:06.053 --> 33:10.057
About a year ago, my daughter
was in town visiting.

33:11.127 --> 33:12.887
She'd been living with
her father

33:12.887 --> 33:15.855
ever since I decided that
I liked women, too.

33:16.408 --> 33:17.961
Folks, especially

33:18.444 --> 33:20.999
family court judges,
weren't too sympathetic

33:20.999 --> 33:22.690
to my circumstances.

33:24.830 --> 33:25.934
Anyway,

33:27.833 --> 33:30.249
you know, we were
having a great time

33:31.216 --> 33:33.356
being together,
just catching up.

33:33.839 --> 33:37.498
And then she tells me
that she's going out on a date

33:37.498 --> 33:40.811
with some guy that
she met online.

33:43.780 --> 33:44.712
Oh.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.508
Look, uh, you know,

33:47.991 --> 33:49.475
you don't
have to tell me.

33:49.855 --> 33:51.546
No, I do.

33:53.824 --> 33:58.795
I should have said,
no you're just a kid.

33:59.244 --> 34:01.453
You don't know this person.

34:03.179 --> 34:06.975
But I didn't want to put her off
so soon after reuniting.

34:08.184 --> 34:10.047
So I said,

34:10.668 --> 34:13.396
okay, have fun.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.572
That was the last
time that I saw her.

34:18.884 --> 34:21.748
Hey. Hey, look,

34:22.266 --> 34:23.853
It's, It's not your fault.

34:23.992 --> 34:25.476
Yes, it was.

34:26.581 --> 34:28.928
We owe it to those
weaker than us

34:28.928 --> 34:30.482
to protect them.

34:35.245 --> 34:35.935
Oh god.

34:36.971 --> 34:40.664
You know, after she disappeared,
I just couldn't look at myself

34:40.664 --> 34:41.734
anymore.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.083
I'd pick the shadiest of bars

34:46.083 --> 34:48.534
and just get blasted
out of my mind,

34:48.534 --> 34:50.916
hoping somebody would end me.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.750
And you know what they say?

34:58.613 --> 34:59.545
Ask and you shall

34:59.580 --> 35:01.168
receive, right?

35:05.482 --> 35:07.243
I was in a really dark place.

35:07.243 --> 35:09.279
I was drinking all the time.

35:10.418 --> 35:13.559
I was an easy target
for anyone looking.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.599
They grabbed me,
ripped my shirt.

35:18.771 --> 35:21.567
But, before I even knew
what was happening,

35:22.396 --> 35:24.294
Tessa was there.

35:24.984 --> 35:30.335
She practically smashed this
guy's skull in with the pipe and

35:30.507 --> 35:34.062
broke this other
dude's leg with a kick.

35:35.581 --> 35:39.551
It was like my avenging
angel had finally arrived,

35:51.321 --> 35:54.462
she said she was a
daughter of Artemus.

35:55.567 --> 35:56.430
Who's that?

35:57.051 --> 35:59.812
One of the most respected
of all the Greek gods.

36:00.606 --> 36:02.574
Zeus's daughter,

36:03.022 --> 36:05.093
the goddess of the hunt.

36:07.268 --> 36:12.170
And so that's,
a hunter's tattoo?

36:12.308 --> 36:13.343
Hmm.

36:15.621 --> 36:17.347
It's really beautiful.

36:19.591 --> 36:21.696
And so are you.

36:28.634 --> 36:29.946
Um,

36:30.498 --> 36:33.294
And what's, what's that?

36:36.815 --> 36:38.679
My daughter's gift?

36:39.887 --> 36:41.889
She bought two,

36:42.165 --> 36:44.823
and we swore to never take
them off so we knew we'd always

36:44.857 --> 36:46.376
be connected.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.139
I'm really sorry.

36:52.900 --> 36:56.144
You have your whole life
ahead of you, Jackson.

36:57.145 --> 36:59.389
Think about your choices.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.431
Where are you going?

37:06.500 --> 37:08.812
It's time for bed.
I'll walk you out.

37:08.847 --> 37:10.331
Okay.

37:25.933 --> 37:28.211
Thanks for talking to me.

37:29.557 --> 37:31.663
Thank you for talking to me.

37:31.870 --> 37:32.767
Course.

37:32.802 --> 37:34.735
I really like talking
to you, Jackson.

37:35.391 --> 37:36.426
Me too.

37:36.737 --> 37:38.773
I appreciate you listening.

37:39.567 --> 37:41.051
There's a lot that

37:42.708 --> 37:45.608
I haven't really told
anyone before, so.

37:48.404 --> 37:50.060
Goodnight, Cassandra.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.579
Goodnight.

37:56.619 --> 37:58.068
Get some rest, Okay?

37:58.793 --> 37:59.898
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:59.898 --> 38:01.382
I'll see you in the morning.

38:23.577 --> 38:25.820
You may be right.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.932
You've been there
the whole time.

38:33.966 --> 38:35.796
Got to keep an eye on my boy.

38:36.659 --> 38:39.558
Make sure he makes good choices.

38:43.493 --> 38:45.944
You don't think that
that's a little creepy

38:45.978 --> 38:48.774
standing out here all
alone in the dark?

38:48.947 --> 38:50.949
You think I'm a
little too protective?

38:51.259 --> 38:52.847
I think you're trying
to make your son

38:52.847 --> 38:54.470
something that he's not.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.580
Maybe you're right.

39:02.823 --> 39:05.826
Guess it's time for us to talk
about why we're really here.

39:05.860 --> 39:06.861
The hunt?

39:06.896 --> 39:09.554
I was wondering
when you were going to ask.

39:09.623 --> 39:11.487
How do I make that 100 grand?

39:11.487 --> 39:12.764
Thought you'd never ask.

39:12.798 --> 39:14.421
Gentlemen.

39:15.836 --> 39:17.458
No. No.

39:17.769 --> 39:19.357
No!

39:25.949 --> 39:27.192
That was fast.

39:27.295 --> 39:29.332
Yeah. Shiny new mixture.

39:29.401 --> 39:32.473
Huh. You guys collect Teddy
and Preston's girl, yet?

39:32.646 --> 39:35.511
They want to play with her
some more till it's time,

39:35.580 --> 39:37.547
but the restraints are
already in place.

39:37.582 --> 39:39.446
You tell them to
knock that shit out.

39:40.136 --> 39:41.862
We're gentlemen, not animals.

39:43.242 --> 39:44.968
We got a big morning.

39:45.486 --> 39:46.522
Put her with the rest.

39:46.522 --> 39:47.730
Yes, sir.

40:08.233 --> 40:11.374
It is spaced, out.

40:11.616 --> 40:12.755
Is it marked?

40:12.789 --> 40:15.551
No, it's not marked. With a hat.

40:15.585 --> 40:16.552
That's fantastic.

40:16.552 --> 40:18.933
I'm done playing and..

40:19.762 --> 40:20.935
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

40:20.935 --> 40:21.902
You go check it out, would ya?

40:22.074 --> 40:23.973
- It's probably gator.
- Just go check it out, please.

40:24.042 --> 40:25.353
We're not doing anything else.

40:25.388 --> 40:27.079
- Just please go check it out.
- Alright.

40:31.567 --> 40:32.913
I'm, I'm so sorry. I was just-

40:32.913 --> 40:33.672
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:33.741 --> 40:34.259
Stop.

40:34.259 --> 40:34.915
No, no, no. I'm-

40:34.915 --> 40:35.260
Stop!

40:36.054 --> 40:37.227
Who are you and what
the hell are you doing here?

40:37.227 --> 40:38.539
I'm so sorry. I, I was...

40:38.574 --> 40:41.024
kayaking, and I must
have taken a wrong turn.

40:41.369 --> 40:42.405
I'm, I'm completely lost.

40:42.405 --> 40:44.476
I don't mean any
trouble, I swear.

40:44.959 --> 40:47.272
She... she can use the phone
back up at the place.

40:47.617 --> 40:48.204
It's all good.

40:48.756 --> 40:49.377
You need a phone?

40:50.033 --> 40:50.758
Thank you.

40:50.931 --> 40:51.794
All right, let's go. Let's go.

40:51.897 --> 40:52.898
Let's get, come on.
Let's get a move on.

40:52.933 --> 40:54.037
Yeah, I don't think so.

41:23.619 --> 41:25.483
You wanna play a
little game Lexi?

41:25.862 --> 41:28.451
No, no.
You guys wore me out.

41:28.831 --> 41:31.212
That shit was
rough, even for me.

41:31.212 --> 41:33.249
Oh, come on, don't
be a spoilsport.

41:34.940 --> 41:37.978
- No. I don't want-
- Come on. It'll be fun.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.050
Tomorrow, anything
you guys want.

41:41.119 --> 41:43.535
Just please let me get
some sleep tonight.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.157
Oh, but we want to go tonight.

41:45.192 --> 41:47.056
- No.
- Yeah, indulge us.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.162
I mean, you're getting paid for
this, and tomorrow's the hunt.

41:51.336 --> 41:55.789
Don't! It's not happening!
I don't want to...

41:57.618 --> 41:59.793
I want to watch you...

42:00.276 --> 42:03.935
SCREAM!

42:05.143 --> 42:07.007
See I told you this is a
fun game.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.456
It's fun.

42:08.733 --> 42:10.458
Fun, fun, fun.

42:38.417 --> 42:39.626
Where am I?

42:40.143 --> 42:41.351
In the barn.

42:41.766 --> 42:43.043
It's where they keep us.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.803
or rape us.

43:00.888 --> 43:02.856
How did you get here?

43:03.270 --> 43:04.961
I came as a tourist from Wales.

43:05.237 --> 43:06.514
Thought if I made the
right connections,

43:06.514 --> 43:07.757
I could get a visa,
and stay.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.103
Become a nurse.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.140
Simple plan, you know?

43:11.209 --> 43:13.107
Do some good and
live a good life.

43:13.142 --> 43:15.558
This young guy I met told me
he knew a judge

43:15.558 --> 43:17.111
who could take care of it.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.251
He said I should come meet him
at this hunt.

43:19.251 --> 43:22.461
I mean, it's a tradition
where I come from, right.

43:23.186 --> 43:23.877
But,

43:24.774 --> 43:27.294
instead of a dead fox,
you win a hundred grand,

43:28.882 --> 43:30.193
Correction,

43:30.953 --> 43:33.196
where they can win
a hundred grand.

43:34.128 --> 43:37.304
They didn't exactly bring us
here to hunt with them.

43:41.722 --> 43:43.621
Why do you think
they brought us here?

43:43.655 --> 43:46.382
Oh, they brought us here to hunt
all right.

43:46.969 --> 43:49.281
They brought us here to hunt us.

43:50.248 --> 43:51.801
Here I was,

43:53.147 --> 43:57.427
a community organizer.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.292
Some guy hit me up
after the protest,

44:00.430 --> 44:03.641
said he was sympathetic
to the cause.

44:05.263 --> 44:07.645
He said he'd give me a shot
at bringing in a hundred k.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.578
I thought they were changing,
you know,

44:10.578 --> 44:15.756
white men finally
listening to us.

44:16.239 --> 44:17.171
Boy, was I dumb.

44:17.827 --> 44:18.794
Not dumb.

44:18.863 --> 44:21.244
Just blinded by greed,
like the rest of us.

44:21.935 --> 44:23.626
We all played into their trap.

44:23.971 --> 44:27.526
And the fact that we did only
justifies all this for them.

44:28.976 --> 44:30.944
Have any of you seen
a girl who wears

44:30.944 --> 44:32.600
an anklet that looks like this?

44:33.084 --> 44:34.085
I don't know.

44:34.810 --> 44:36.812
They keep us locked
up and half starved.

44:36.846 --> 44:38.814
Girls keep coming and going.

44:38.986 --> 44:40.608
I've been here longest.

44:41.126 --> 44:42.093
How long?

44:42.127 --> 44:44.060
Months, maybe?

44:44.405 --> 44:46.891
We don't have a clock
or a calendar. But,

44:46.925 --> 44:48.927
none of the other girls that
were here before me are left.

44:49.445 --> 44:50.308
But I...

44:50.584 --> 44:53.725
heard a young girl tried
to escape before I got here.

44:54.174 --> 44:55.831
Do you know what
happened to her?

44:56.141 --> 44:57.487
What do you think
happened to her?

44:57.556 --> 44:58.937
They brought us all here to die.

45:04.494 --> 45:06.807
I just need you to hang on
a little longer.

45:08.395 --> 45:10.397
I promise I'll help you escape.

45:10.431 --> 45:12.744
There's just something
I need to do first.

45:12.813 --> 45:15.126
Didn't you hear me?
There's no way out.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.990
Except dying.

45:19.544 --> 45:23.272
And maybe, just maybe,

45:23.513 --> 45:27.586
we are taking...
one of them with us.

45:39.046 --> 45:40.185
Hey, you there?

45:40.876 --> 45:42.084
Whaddaya got?

45:42.118 --> 45:43.257
We're in position
in the Northeast.

45:43.395 --> 45:45.604
We started our patrol, but then
we found a kayak on the beach.

45:45.639 --> 45:48.435
We investigated it a little bit
more and we found a two-man tent

45:48.573 --> 45:51.162
- Any sign of the occupant?
- No.

45:51.887 --> 45:52.611
Whoever it is,

45:53.198 --> 45:54.959
it looks like they paddled up on
shore and started a cold camp.

45:55.028 --> 45:56.581
Tracks tell you where
he's headed?

45:56.581 --> 45:57.478
<i>There are none.</i>

45:57.755 --> 45:59.239
We would have thought that
the kayak was a wash up

45:59.239 --> 46:00.412
if we didn't find the tent.

46:00.516 --> 46:01.448
<i>It could just be a visitor.</i>

46:01.517 --> 46:02.898
We don't get visitors.

46:02.932 --> 46:03.899
What do you advise?

46:05.038 --> 46:07.212
I'm thinking lone man.

46:07.281 --> 46:09.870
Pack the tent in the kayak
and scuttle it out to sea.

46:10.319 --> 46:11.838
Someone'll eventually find it

46:12.562 --> 46:14.081
and think he died in the water.

46:14.944 --> 46:16.118
Roger that.

46:16.118 --> 46:17.050
And Bob,

46:17.913 --> 46:19.328
<i>you need to find him.</i>

46:19.397 --> 46:21.295
And what happens
if we make contact.

46:22.124 --> 46:24.160
Draw straws, see
who gets first shot.

46:24.229 --> 46:25.610
<i>Sounds like a plan.</i>

46:29.234 --> 46:31.616
Good, I'm gonna
feed them dogs.

46:33.894 --> 46:35.033
Where is everybody?

46:36.241 --> 46:38.796
Well, Teddy and
Preston are running late.

46:39.935 --> 46:42.075
Everybody else is in position.

46:42.109 --> 46:43.973
Today's all about you, son.

46:45.112 --> 46:45.941
You ready?

46:46.976 --> 46:47.390
Yeah.

46:48.115 --> 46:49.634
Well, let's go get your quarry.

46:50.738 --> 46:51.153
Yeah.

46:51.256 --> 46:52.395
C'mon.

47:18.042 --> 47:21.286
It is customary for a hunter
to choose his quarry.

47:22.425 --> 47:23.841
Who do you choose?

47:24.462 --> 47:25.256
Uh...

47:36.646 --> 47:38.856
Oh, she'll do fine.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.651
She's got a lot of fire in her.

47:41.686 --> 47:43.895
Well, since you brought game,

47:43.895 --> 47:46.518
a hunter is entitled
to a second choice.

47:46.967 --> 47:48.037
If you choose.

47:49.383 --> 47:51.006
Who's your second.

47:52.559 --> 47:54.285
Um, the redhead.

47:56.321 --> 47:58.737
I forgot. Hunt rules.

47:59.186 --> 48:01.809
The second is always
the quarry that was brought.

48:03.156 --> 48:04.743
And that would you.

48:20.242 --> 48:21.760
Go on, girl.

48:27.076 --> 48:28.526
Well, let's have
some fun, right?

48:28.526 --> 48:29.907
Yeah.

48:29.907 --> 48:33.117
You have to survive for
24 hours, if you do, we will

48:33.117 --> 48:36.154
pay you a hundred thousand
dollars as promised,

48:36.603 --> 48:38.225
and then we'll let you go.

48:38.329 --> 48:38.881
Bullshit.

48:40.055 --> 48:40.987
I assure you,

48:41.711 --> 48:42.609
I am a gentleman.

48:42.781 --> 48:44.266
And as such, my word is my bond.

48:44.266 --> 48:45.853
Yeah, but that's because
no one's actually made

48:45.853 --> 48:46.854
it out of here, right?

48:48.822 --> 48:51.376
You'll be in a forest
surrounded by water,

48:52.239 --> 48:54.241
miles away from
the nearest town.

48:54.552 --> 48:56.864
Water filled with crocs, snakes.

48:57.658 --> 48:59.937
Beaches are patrolled by hunters
who will turn you back

48:59.937 --> 49:03.112
to the forest or shoot you
if you try to swim away.

49:03.147 --> 49:05.459
If you return to the compound
before the allotted time,

49:05.459 --> 49:07.220
you will be shot on sight.

49:07.220 --> 49:08.531
Do you understand?

49:09.084 --> 49:11.155
How much time do we have
before you come after us?

49:11.465 --> 49:13.571
Half an hour, release them.

49:15.573 --> 49:17.747
Oh. Well.

49:23.788 --> 49:26.135
May God be with you.

49:26.964 --> 49:28.103
Well, you know what?

49:28.448 --> 49:30.381
That bitch right
about one thing?

49:32.003 --> 49:33.798
Ain't nobody ever
escaped from here.

49:35.834 --> 49:37.422
Those two boys
racked up them two girls,

49:37.422 --> 49:38.768
like old pros.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.529
They'll be fine new
additions to the club.

49:40.529 --> 49:42.324
Made me a pretty penny too.

49:43.739 --> 49:44.912
Great, Steve.

49:44.912 --> 49:47.156
And glad to hear, Malcolm.

49:47.812 --> 49:49.158
What time is your
boy heading out?

49:49.193 --> 49:50.332
Any minute now.

49:51.264 --> 49:52.679
Your boy nervous?

49:53.438 --> 49:55.095
Nah, he's a chip off the old-

49:58.133 --> 50:00.238
Why did it have to be Cassandra?

50:03.276 --> 50:05.174
Back soon, gentlemen.

50:10.490 --> 50:11.387
You've been drinking.

50:11.525 --> 50:12.733
Answer my question.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.427
You knew when you came here
that you'd be hunting a woman.

50:17.773 --> 50:18.705
Yeah, but

50:19.154 --> 50:20.362
not her.

50:22.364 --> 50:23.330
She's nice.

50:25.160 --> 50:28.163
Sooner or later,
she'd have to be hunted, too.

50:29.371 --> 50:31.614
You knew that when
she came with us.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.171
I don't want to.

50:38.828 --> 50:40.037
But you will.

50:50.530 --> 50:52.532
This is my grandfather's.

50:52.946 --> 50:56.881
Took it off a German officer
he killed with his bare hands.

50:57.502 --> 51:01.058
He then passed it to my father
on his first hunt.

51:01.851 --> 51:03.819
And then passed it down to me.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.408
Now it's my turn

51:06.408 --> 51:07.719
to give it to you.

51:14.381 --> 51:15.934
We're going to fix you, son.

51:19.938 --> 51:20.698
Today

51:21.595 --> 51:23.287
you will make
decisions that will

51:23.287 --> 51:24.736
direct the rest of your life.

51:25.358 --> 51:26.359
Today

51:27.429 --> 51:29.051
you become an alpha male.

51:29.914 --> 51:32.019
Who never has to
fear a woman again.

51:32.019 --> 51:34.677
When your son becomes
worthy of the hunt, you

51:36.369 --> 51:37.542
give that to him.

51:39.786 --> 51:42.409
So now you get yourself
some breakfast.

51:43.445 --> 51:44.722
I don't.

51:44.756 --> 51:46.793
I don't think I could
even eat right now.

51:46.862 --> 51:48.208
Understandable.

51:49.796 --> 51:52.143
When you're ready,
go see Virgil.

51:52.971 --> 51:56.285
He's got some, uh,
equipment for you.

51:59.495 --> 52:00.807
Good luck, son.

52:17.858 --> 52:20.620
We need to split up,
spread out the odds.

52:21.345 --> 52:22.518
You should stay with me.

52:22.518 --> 52:23.485
I can help protect you.

52:23.485 --> 52:25.659
The hell I should.

52:26.488 --> 52:29.007
What the fuck do you think

52:29.007 --> 52:31.596
that you can do for me
besides slow me down?

52:32.356 --> 52:33.460
At least I got this.

52:33.805 --> 52:37.671
As soon as I get a
chance, I am sticking

52:38.810 --> 52:40.847
that white fucker
and I'm taking his crossbow

52:40.847 --> 52:42.642
and then I'm actually going
to really have a chance.

52:42.814 --> 52:45.162
And how do you plan on doing
that for getting killed first?

52:45.472 --> 52:47.440
Don't worry about me, okay?

52:49.304 --> 52:52.962
You pick a direction and I'm
going to go the other way.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.178
Do not follow me.

53:20.611 --> 53:21.267
What a shame.

53:22.889 --> 53:23.993
Prey have separated.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.686
I guess they think if they split
up, they're going to be harder

53:26.720 --> 53:27.894
to find.

53:46.050 --> 53:47.534
That's right, motherfuckers.

53:47.534 --> 53:48.708
Now you got Brooklyn
in the house

53:48.708 --> 53:49.709
and we don't take sh...

53:50.744 --> 53:51.814
Ah!

54:12.835 --> 54:14.665
Please...

54:23.467 --> 54:26.711
Ah! Fuck!

54:52.875 --> 54:54.360
shit.

55:03.438 --> 55:05.785
Jackson.

55:05.785 --> 55:09.478
Stay where you are.

55:09.513 --> 55:11.549
Put down the crossbow.

55:12.136 --> 55:13.482
Can't.

55:14.414 --> 55:16.761
- This is the only way.
- No.

55:17.521 --> 55:19.454
This is evil.

55:19.488 --> 55:21.179
And you know it.

55:21.973 --> 55:24.148
We can figure a way out of this.

55:24.148 --> 55:25.287
I can't.

55:26.771 --> 55:28.911
I promised my dad.

55:29.153 --> 55:31.189
You can tell him you were wrong.

55:31.638 --> 55:33.019
Stay where you are.

55:33.191 --> 55:34.020
Jackson.

55:35.470 --> 55:36.125
Listen,

55:36.263 --> 55:37.610
put down the crossbow.

55:38.818 --> 55:41.268
It's okay, it's okay.

55:41.959 --> 55:44.133
It's okay, it's okay.

55:47.689 --> 55:48.828
Here you go.

55:49.863 --> 55:50.795
It's okay.

55:52.141 --> 55:53.142
It's okay.

55:53.867 --> 55:55.835
Good boy. It's okay.

55:55.904 --> 55:57.492
I'm not...I'm not a boy.

55:57.492 --> 55:58.631
I'm a man!

56:14.854 --> 56:16.925
Coming up on two hours, Carter.

56:16.994 --> 56:19.548
And past three,
I'm out 50 grand.

56:30.387 --> 56:31.353
Yeah, go ahead.

56:31.422 --> 56:32.527
Anything yet?

56:36.151 --> 56:37.186
No, sir.

56:42.675 --> 56:45.332
Let me know as soon as you make
contact with the visitor.

56:48.577 --> 56:50.855
And there's still one
from the hunt alive.

56:51.822 --> 56:52.926
Roger that.

56:53.617 --> 56:55.688
Oh. What's the word?

56:56.516 --> 56:57.724
Stay on your toes.

56:58.104 --> 57:00.727
If one of them makes a
break for the beach, we're
gunna have to move fast.

57:37.764 --> 57:39.248
What are you doing back here?

57:41.665 --> 57:43.045
One of them got me.

57:51.882 --> 57:52.779
Here.

57:55.610 --> 57:57.784
How'd she manage to stick you?

57:57.957 --> 57:59.821
You didn't have your
back to her, did you?

57:59.855 --> 58:01.478
Doesn't matter, she's dead now.

58:03.238 --> 58:04.722
And the other one?

58:12.765 --> 58:13.938
You know,

58:14.836 --> 58:16.803
I remember my first hunt,

58:18.287 --> 58:20.324
I threw up afterwards.

58:22.671 --> 58:24.431
I'm not proud of that. But,

58:25.502 --> 58:28.435
a cherry popped is a
cherry popped.

58:30.955 --> 58:32.025
Well, I'll get her.

58:32.647 --> 58:34.994
The only reason I came back
to get my hand good.

58:35.304 --> 58:36.443
So my aim would be true.

58:37.686 --> 58:39.308
Well that's smart.

58:42.208 --> 58:43.589
I'm proud of you, Jackson.

58:45.004 --> 58:46.523
Very proud.

58:46.971 --> 58:48.145
Thanks, Dad.

58:48.697 --> 58:50.630
You know, I won't let you down.

58:51.700 --> 58:53.012
I know you won't.

58:56.291 --> 58:57.326
C'mon.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.004
Oh my god.

59:34.536 --> 59:37.194
Now, I know you're
prey is still out there, but

59:37.194 --> 59:38.816
you got wounded in the hunt.

59:41.681 --> 59:44.339
So I'm going to put you
in the member's block

59:47.860 --> 59:49.827
You're officially
one of us now.

59:58.077 --> 01:00:00.355
Tonight we celebrate.

01:00:00.873 --> 01:00:03.047
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Um...

01:00:04.877 --> 01:00:07.017
I feel like this has
really changed me.

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:08.052
It has.

01:00:09.088 --> 01:00:11.021
You're an Alpha now,

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.850
an apex predator.

01:00:13.817 --> 01:00:14.956
You remember that.

01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:17.752
Now go see Virgil.

01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:19.546
Get some bolts and
get back out there.

01:00:31.386 --> 01:00:32.870
Oh my god.

01:00:39.497 --> 01:00:40.429
Oh my...

01:00:49.093 --> 01:00:51.095
Oh my god.

01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:56.273
Oh.

01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:09.148
Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:12.151
No.

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:18.122
No! No, no, no....

01:01:20.504 --> 01:01:22.920
Nooo, no.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:32.689
Noooo!

01:01:41.145 --> 01:01:42.181
Hey, sorry.

01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:45.011
It's me.

01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:47.738
What the fuck took you so long?

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.845
My baby....

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:53.537
I came in last night.

01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:56.022
But these assholes on to me,
so we got to get going. Okay?

01:01:56.022 --> 01:01:57.541
Get this fucking thing off me.

01:02:00.233 --> 01:02:01.372
Okay.

01:02:01.856 --> 01:02:02.960
Oh, God.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.862
Let's get started.

01:02:08.379 --> 01:02:09.035
Finish it.

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.228
Put down the crossbow, Jackson.

01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:06.783
I said put it down.

01:03:10.062 --> 01:03:11.063
Okay.

01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:16.896
I thought we had something.

01:03:19.105 --> 01:03:21.625
You looked so innocent
when we first met.

01:03:24.076 --> 01:03:24.939
I'm sorry.

01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:27.148
I wanted to save
you from all this.

01:03:27.424 --> 01:03:28.666
Sorry.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:32.394
I'm sorry, okay?

01:03:33.326 --> 01:03:35.121
- But my dad-
- Dad. Always your dad.

01:03:35.156 --> 01:03:38.953
You... made the decision,
Jackson.

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:40.955
You did.

01:03:40.955 --> 01:03:42.128
These girls,

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.614
they had names.

01:03:46.477 --> 01:03:47.271
Just...

01:03:47.962 --> 01:03:50.309
My daughter had a name.

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.312
Jus- just put the gun down.

01:03:54.175 --> 01:03:55.832
We can figure this out.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.937
Okay? I'm sorry, but...

01:03:57.937 --> 01:03:59.697
I say kill the fucker.

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:14.643
Please.

01:04:20.615 --> 01:04:21.719
Earrings worked great.

01:04:21.823 --> 01:04:23.860
The GPS chip fit perfect.

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:30.211
Listen, I saw
something in his eyes.

01:04:30.832 --> 01:04:32.351
He could have killed
me, but he didn't.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.662
Yeah, he probably just choked.

01:04:33.697 --> 01:04:35.388
Don't second guess it.

01:04:40.842 --> 01:04:42.671
Alright, let's finish this.

01:04:48.608 --> 01:04:51.370
I got to tell you guys.
I mean, holding that lifeless

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.373
body in my arms,
the power unreal,

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.512
- Right?
- Fuck yeah.

01:04:55.581 --> 01:04:56.720
Fuck yeah.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.722
This is what Carter
was talking about.

01:04:58.756 --> 01:05:01.380
This is what it feels like
to reclaim being a man.

01:05:01.518 --> 01:05:02.346
Fuck yeah.

01:05:02.346 --> 01:05:03.002
Damn straight.

01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:04.693
You know why guys?
Because we're Alphas.

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:05.522
Alpha males.

01:05:05.522 --> 01:05:06.350
Yeah.

01:05:06.385 --> 01:05:08.283
Hunt! Hunt! Hunt! Hunt!

01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:11.217
Hunt! Hunt! Hunt! Hunt! Hunt!

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:12.839
Hunt!!!!

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.430
The fuck was that?

01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:20.917
Fuck, he's dead.

01:05:21.503 --> 01:05:23.022
Go check that shit out.

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:24.403
No you go fucking check it out.

01:05:24.472 --> 01:05:25.680
I said go check the
fucking shit out.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.751
Hey, I'm not a pussy.

01:05:27.785 --> 01:05:30.133
- I'll go check it out.
- Over there.

01:05:30.202 --> 01:05:31.513
That's where it came from.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.274
All right, you bitch.

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:35.241
Where are you bitch?

01:05:35.759 --> 01:05:37.278
Come on, bitch.

01:05:37.347 --> 01:05:38.244
You see her?

01:05:39.073 --> 01:05:40.108
<i>Come on, bitch.</i>

01:05:40.108 --> 01:05:41.247
<i>Yeah, inside there, </i><i>
in the woods. </i>

01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:42.076
<i>Come on, bitch.</i>

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:43.698
She came from in there.

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:48.530
Holy fuck.

01:05:49.255 --> 01:05:51.809
No, wait.
Wait. wait.

01:05:56.228 --> 01:05:57.815
Oh, I'm going to
enjoy this bitch.

01:05:58.161 --> 01:06:00.473
I'm going to take you out
like you never seen before.

01:06:00.818 --> 01:06:03.166
I am going to fuck
you up so fucking bad

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.547
you're not going to know
what the fuck hit- Oh!

01:06:18.595 --> 01:06:20.114
Fuck you bitch.

01:06:20.528 --> 01:06:22.979
Language, try using
big boy words.

01:06:26.672 --> 01:06:27.914
Fuck you.

01:06:28.363 --> 01:06:29.640
Hmm. Yeah, that's not it.

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:34.266
You want to know what a
dead body really feels like.

01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:37.959
Dead weight.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:43.827
C'mon.

01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:14.306
That's Virgil.

01:07:14.685 --> 01:07:16.342
He's the one who has
the keys to the barn.

01:07:16.342 --> 01:07:19.518
He's a hard, mean old fucker so
he won't go down without a fight

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.981
Let's get this fucker.

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:02.250
He killed our friend. Right.

01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:09.499
April, Dennis, do you copy?

01:08:10.776 --> 01:08:11.328
Okay.

01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:12.467
You got this?

01:08:12.571 --> 01:08:13.744
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

01:08:14.814 --> 01:08:17.852
Hold him here until
I get back. Okay?

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:18.956
I'm going for Carter.

01:08:20.268 --> 01:08:21.096
Hey!

01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:25.100
Easy.

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.344
Give me the keys to
the holding area.

01:08:27.758 --> 01:08:29.104
Now!

01:08:33.038 --> 01:08:34.938
Easy!

01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:52.438
What you gonna do, huh?

01:08:52.645 --> 01:08:54.163
What you gonna do, huh?

01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:56.546
You want some of this, huh?

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.572
How does that feel,

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:23.745
Huh?

01:09:24.263 --> 01:09:25.506
How does that feel?

01:09:35.032 --> 01:09:36.344
Let her go!

01:09:37.794 --> 01:09:39.416
I said NOW!

01:09:45.663 --> 01:09:47.183
I thought you got this.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.705
I did.

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:54.845
Man, god damn.

01:09:54.845 --> 01:09:57.365
You're lookin all cocky
cause you're holding a gun.

01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:00.023
Oh, look at you all manly
because you chase defenseless

01:10:00.023 --> 01:10:01.300
women while holding guns.

01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:02.888
Don't forget the crossbow.

01:10:03.302 --> 01:10:04.752
Keep things primal.

01:10:05.062 --> 01:10:08.307
That, uh, bracelet there
you got on your wrist.

01:10:09.895 --> 01:10:11.552
I knew something
looked familiar.

01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:16.522
Yeah, a girl, I run into, uh...

01:10:17.523 --> 01:10:19.318
was wearing a bracelet
like that.

01:10:24.185 --> 01:10:26.187
No, no, please.

01:10:26.774 --> 01:10:30.398
I won't run away again.
I swear, please.

01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:33.505
No. Virgil, please.

01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:39.442
That was my daughter.

01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:41.858
You know, I kind of can

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:43.894
see the family resemblance.

01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:48.520
Put up a fight
when I killed her.

01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:11.577
This is for my daughter,

01:11:11.577 --> 01:11:13.199
you piece of shit.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:20.862
See you in hell, fucker.

01:11:20.897 --> 01:11:22.519
Okay. What now?

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.074
Dog's are hungry.

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:35.705
C'mon.

01:11:43.609 --> 01:11:45.577
I'm going to the lodge
to get some scotch.

01:11:45.577 --> 01:11:46.405
You want anything?

01:11:46.888 --> 01:11:48.062
Oh no.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:51.410
Oh, maybe some aloe
for my dick.

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.963
I think that little lady,

01:11:52.963 --> 01:11:54.793
she just fucked
ten years off my dick.

01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:55.587
Yeah.

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:58.624
Oh, man, I need a shower.

01:11:58.659 --> 01:12:00.695
Oh, tell you though.

01:12:00.764 --> 01:12:03.008
What we do need to do,
is we need to probably save

01:12:03.008 --> 01:12:04.527
little miss Lexi
for the last night.

01:12:04.803 --> 01:12:06.770
She's running a
little low on energy.

01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:09.704
Yeah, but I don't think
another day with us

01:12:09.704 --> 01:12:10.947
is going to give her any rest.

01:12:11.706 --> 01:12:12.983
That's a good point.

01:12:13.018 --> 01:12:14.709
Well I'll tell you what, those
blue pills are something else.

01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:16.918
It could...keep me
going all night.

01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:19.818
Like gas to a lit flame.

01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:21.578
Save me some.

01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:44.808
I'm gonna go to the lodge
for some whiskey.

01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:48.433
Oof.

01:13:00.306 --> 01:13:01.894
There's nothing better than
taking a piss

01:13:01.894 --> 01:13:03.240
in the woods anyway.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.495
Ahh!

01:13:20.741 --> 01:13:22.259
- You cut off my-
- Your John Bobbitt.

01:13:22.259 --> 01:13:22.881
Yeah.

01:13:23.295 --> 01:13:24.848
And I almost missed it
because it's so small.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.988
Fuck you, bitch.

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:29.232
Just finish me, please.

01:13:30.233 --> 01:13:31.130
No, thanks.

01:13:31.234 --> 01:13:33.029
I'd rather watch you
bleed out and suffer.

01:13:35.238 --> 01:13:36.929
Let's split up.

01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:39.863
This sicko and his brother
had a girl with him.

01:13:39.898 --> 01:13:42.383
Her name's Lexie.
Check out their cabin.

01:13:42.866 --> 01:13:43.798
What about you?

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:45.041
I'm going to the lodge.

01:13:45.075 --> 01:13:46.594
Carter's mine.

01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:48.872
I'll meet you there
after I pay the brother a visit.

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:50.184
Be careful.

01:13:50.356 --> 01:13:51.737
These guys are snakes.

01:13:51.772 --> 01:13:52.635
You be careful.

01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:54.706
You're looking for
the damn king cobra himself.

01:16:08.702 --> 01:16:11.394
You sick bastard.

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:32.829
Jesus, what have you...

01:16:34.797 --> 01:16:35.660
Fuck.

01:16:42.356 --> 01:16:44.530
Hey! Who are you?

01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:45.462
What do you want?

01:16:45.462 --> 01:16:47.603
Enough about me, I'd
rather focus on you.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.260
Bitch, you-
Oh! You broke my nose.

01:16:50.467 --> 01:16:54.195
And now you're focused.
Untie her legs. Now!

01:16:56.991 --> 01:16:58.821
- I said now!
- Oh, okay. Oh!

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:01.893
Oh, look, look, I got money.

01:17:01.962 --> 01:17:04.171
Why do men always think
money solves everything?

01:17:04.171 --> 01:17:05.759
- Whatever you want!
- Shut up!

01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:07.623
Shut up and get on the bed now.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:08.554
Bitch.

01:17:10.902 --> 01:17:13.111
Ow. Ow.

01:17:13.145 --> 01:17:14.491
You okay?

01:17:14.975 --> 01:17:17.391
I'd like to cut his dick off
for what he did to me.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.393
I already did that
to his brother.

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:21.775
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.

01:17:21.809 --> 01:17:23.224
There's knife on the bed
if you want to make them

01:17:23.224 --> 01:17:25.019
truly identical twins.

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:27.746
What? Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:27.781 --> 01:17:29.230
Oh God. Look,
like I said, I pay you.

01:17:29.265 --> 01:17:30.853
I know you like money.

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:33.062
I don't want payment asshole.

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:34.926
I want payback.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.637
You're not getting
out of this one.

01:17:58.363 --> 01:17:59.157
Where's Jackson?

01:18:01.021 --> 01:18:02.160
Where do you think?

01:18:08.028 --> 01:18:09.650
Don't play games with me.

01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:10.858
Or what?

01:18:11.307 --> 01:18:12.549
You'll kill me.

01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:15.276
I'm gonna do worse than that.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.971
You're going to beg me to turn
your lights out before I'm done.

01:18:21.455 --> 01:18:23.491
You don't have the balls,

01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:27.288
just like your son who couldn't
bring himself to shoot me.

01:18:33.122 --> 01:18:34.157
What'd you do?

01:18:34.848 --> 01:18:37.126
Seduce him you little whore.

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:39.507
Oh!

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:48.344
Looks like someone forgot the
cardinal rule of the hunt.

01:18:48.585 --> 01:18:52.555
Never get too close to
or emotional about your prey.

01:18:53.245 --> 01:18:56.076
Oh, oh, oh

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.355
You killed him.

01:19:00.563 --> 01:19:03.428
You did, with all
your alfa bullshit.

01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:07.639
Murdering women just
so some weak scared

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:11.367
assholes can feel some
misguided sense of superiority.

01:19:11.436 --> 01:19:13.749
People die every day,

01:19:14.335 --> 01:19:16.027
it was a just cause.

01:19:16.199 --> 01:19:17.028
Funny...

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.582
and I'm here
for a cause too.

01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:22.758
My daughter came here
about six months ago.

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:25.450
She was doing what Lexi
was doing online,

01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:27.590
trying to earn money
for college.

01:19:27.866 --> 01:19:29.972
I had nothing to do with that.

01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:32.388
You had everything do with it.

01:19:32.457 --> 01:19:35.080
We heard about your little hunt
club on the dark web.

01:19:35.115 --> 01:19:36.875
It just took us a while
to track you down.

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:39.084
Remember the scene at the diner?

01:19:39.119 --> 01:19:41.638
It was me trying to
infiltrate your group.

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:43.917
The kayak.

01:19:44.227 --> 01:19:45.642
It's your girlfriend.

01:19:46.298 --> 01:19:47.299
I should have known.

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:49.198
Yeah. It's not
very alpha of you.

01:19:50.061 --> 01:19:51.234
What about you?

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:52.891
You killed all these men.

01:19:54.272 --> 01:19:55.583
You're just like me.

01:19:55.998 --> 01:19:57.482
Oh I'm nothing like you.

01:19:58.069 --> 01:19:59.725
I only kill bad people.

01:20:00.761 --> 01:20:02.004
Is that so?

01:20:02.418 --> 01:20:03.729
You didn't have to kill them.

01:20:05.352 --> 01:20:07.043
You did it because you like it.

01:20:07.492 --> 01:20:08.907
I did it

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:12.842
because you murdered
my daughter.

01:20:13.256 --> 01:20:14.982
It's not the same thing.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.742
It's exactly the same!

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.952
You came here to
save your daughter.

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:20.816
I was trying to save my son!

01:20:21.437 --> 01:20:22.818
And look at us.

01:20:23.439 --> 01:20:24.509
Look at us now.

01:20:24.578 --> 01:20:26.062
We're both grieving.

01:20:27.098 --> 01:20:28.996
Do you know the
history behind my name?

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:29.997
No.

01:20:30.653 --> 01:20:33.483
Cassandra was the
daughter of the King of Troy.

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:36.624
She was a virgin priestess
to the God Apollo.

01:20:37.487 --> 01:20:39.006
He tried to win her hand,

01:20:39.006 --> 01:20:41.388
so he granted her
the power of foresight.

01:20:41.733 --> 01:20:44.529
But she refused his advances.
So he cursed her,

01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:47.221
made it so no one would ever
believe her prophecies.

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:52.192
She was raped and then sold and
eventually killed by the Greeks.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.541
So you hate men
based on mythology?

01:20:58.715 --> 01:20:59.958
You don't get it.

01:21:01.304 --> 01:21:03.513
You were creating monsters here.

01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:06.689
That's what drew the
daughters of Artemus to you.

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:09.968
The Goddess of the hunt.

01:21:11.211 --> 01:21:12.695
You're no goddess.

01:21:13.006 --> 01:21:15.836
You're just a garden
variety vigilante.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:18.839
Get up.

01:21:20.358 --> 01:21:21.462
Get up!

01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:24.017
Let's go.

01:21:24.569 --> 01:21:26.743
I'm reaping my spoils.

01:21:30.368 --> 01:21:32.197
I told you I'd come back.

01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:38.238
I want to present
you ladies with a choice.

01:21:39.032 --> 01:21:41.655
Carter, here, is
the hunt master.

01:21:42.104 --> 01:21:44.658
This is his island,
his hunt club.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.903
He's been hunting
women here for decades,

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.907
but he claims that
he's suffered,

01:21:52.631 --> 01:21:55.393
lost his son, pretty
much everything.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.188
Fuck him.

01:21:57.533 --> 01:21:58.914
Karma's a bitch.

01:22:01.054 --> 01:22:02.227
You have three options.

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:06.783
Option A, you can contact
the authorities and

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:09.717
let the legal system
enact justice

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:11.616
for everything that
you've been through.

01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:12.617
He's rich.

01:22:12.651 --> 01:22:13.894
He'll find a way to
get away with it.

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:15.275
They always do.

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:18.209
I don't think prison
is good enough for him.

01:22:18.795 --> 01:22:19.796
Option B,

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.220
there's a hundred thousand
dollars right there.

01:22:29.599 --> 01:22:34.363
You can divide up that money,
leave the island, release him,

01:22:34.915 --> 01:22:37.055
forget all of this
ever happened,

01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:38.643
and move
on with your lives.

01:22:38.919 --> 01:22:42.302
Option C, you take the money

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:47.721
and you deal Carter yourselves.

01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:48.825
Wait, wait a second.

01:22:48.825 --> 01:22:49.412
Shut up!

01:22:50.482 --> 01:22:52.243
I swear you all talk too much.

01:22:52.277 --> 01:22:54.900
If you choose Option C, I
recommend you torch the compound

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.833
Destroy any evidence
that you were ever here.

01:22:57.455 --> 01:22:58.732
You don't want any of this?

01:22:58.939 --> 01:22:59.698
Not our jam.

01:22:59.802 --> 01:23:01.631
We're hunters, not
bounty hunters.

01:23:01.942 --> 01:23:04.151
All the boats down on the docks
have their keys in them, right?

01:23:05.808 --> 01:23:07.741
Your choice, ladies.

01:23:13.678 --> 01:23:14.748
Ladies.

01:23:15.335 --> 01:23:17.302
We...We can discuss this

01:23:18.303 --> 01:23:20.650
Like you said, I'm rich.

01:23:27.312 --> 01:23:28.796
You don't have to do this.

01:23:28.969 --> 01:23:30.453
Ahh!

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.186
You okay?

01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:40.877
Oh much better.

01:23:41.361 --> 01:23:43.846
It's not mine, at
least most of it.

01:23:44.157 --> 01:23:45.296
Is that the book?

01:23:46.262 --> 01:23:46.780
Yeah,

01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:50.370
All their names and addresses.

01:23:51.474 --> 01:23:53.683
They've got members
all over the world.

01:23:54.374 --> 01:23:56.169
Plus hunt clubs, like this one?

01:23:58.309 --> 01:24:01.519
Mm, no. Oh!

01:24:03.383 --> 01:24:06.213
This is going to really hurt.

01:24:09.699 --> 01:24:11.322
sounds like they
went with option C.

01:24:11.874 --> 01:24:13.289
We forget anything?

01:24:14.842 --> 01:24:16.568
Not exactly anything.

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:25.060
Tessa.

01:24:55.469 --> 01:24:57.264
Are you really going
to search for all these guys

01:24:57.264 --> 01:24:58.196
and make them pay?

01:24:59.059 --> 01:25:00.060
Looks that way.

01:25:00.716 --> 01:25:01.889
Can I join you?

01:25:03.374 --> 01:25:04.616
I don't know,
what do you think?

01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:08.103
I think if you're going to
join us, you need a new name.

01:25:08.482 --> 01:25:10.622
Like mine. Symbolic.

01:25:11.313 --> 01:25:12.417
That's fine.

01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:16.352
I wanted to keep my identity
private from these guys.

01:25:17.733 --> 01:25:19.735
Lexi's not even my real name.

01:25:20.425 --> 01:25:21.219
What is it?

01:25:23.256 --> 01:25:24.257
Diana.

01:25:26.742 --> 01:25:27.639
What?

01:25:28.433 --> 01:25:30.470
Diana is the Roman name
for Goddess of the Hunt.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.127
No shit?

01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:36.269
Let's get hunting.
