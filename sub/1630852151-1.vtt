02:45.382 --> 02:47.732
Hello, three?
All clear. Bring it in.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.322
Brigade.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.629
Once more unto the breach.

05:26.674 --> 05:27.979
Yes, chef.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.422
Where the fuck am I?

07:23.617 --> 07:26.315
- Look, it's Diana.
- Excuse me.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.623
-I'm looking for somewhere.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.842
I've absolutely no idea where I
am.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.372
There are no signs anywhere.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.290
Where am I?

08:35.732 --> 08:36.820
Right.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.131
"Half my weight's in jewellery,
anyway."

08:47.614 --> 08:49.790
Do you remember when she said
that?

08:49.833 --> 08:52.619
I wasn't here,
but I heard about it.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.534
Is she here yet?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.798
Not yet, ma'am, no.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.713
Then she's late.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.021
And he is early.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.594
And yet she is late.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.946
Well, well, well.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.584
Excuse me!

10:45.645 --> 10:48.038
What the bloody hell
are you doing here, Diana?

10:48.691 --> 10:51.302
Sorry, I mean... your royal
highness.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.219
I'm lost.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.660
But if it's you,
I must be close, yes?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.140
Yeah, the house is just there
but...

11:03.706 --> 11:05.360
Why are you driving yourself?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.145
Well, cars don't drive on their
own.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.669
No.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.325
Where's your driver?
Where's your security detail?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.023
I don't know

11:17.633 --> 11:19.611
I was in the café in Kensington
giving some presents and...

11:19.635 --> 11:21.376
I thought I might just...

11:21.985 --> 11:22.986
Drive.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.379
Do they know?

11:25.859 --> 11:26.859
No.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.384
I just drove.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.257
Well, anyway.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.041
Hello again.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.609
Hello, Darren.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.091
Is everybody there?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.877
Well,
apart from her majesty, yeah.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.530
Perfect.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.406
Look.

11:51.798 --> 11:52.886
Of course.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.844
Now I know where I am.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.978
We used to call him bertie.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.938
I think that's my father's coat
he's wearing.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.899
We used to live
just over that hill.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.771
Papa used to give the farmer
his old clothes.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.389
Gosh, how could I get lost in
a place where I used to play?

12:18.433 --> 12:20.478
We should really get going.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.266
Will they kill me, do you think?

12:26.484 --> 12:27.964
I'm going to check.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.400
-Check what?

12:29.661 --> 12:31.794
Look, it's sandwiches
in 15 minutes.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.665
- It's papa's, I'm sure of it.
- Wait.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.930
Say there was a big tractor
broken down or something, eh?

12:36.973 --> 12:38.148
Say you got lost.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.409
Anything.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.680
It's too late for trying
broken tractors on them.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.633
Her majesty.

14:13.809 --> 14:14.941
Your royal highness.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.148
Hello.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.673
No.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.850
Gary usually lets me off.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.114
Gary, your royal highness?

15:41.157 --> 15:44.204
The normal page.
The usual Christmas page.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.467
We have a thing between us,
an understanding.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.252
I don't usually do
the getting-weighed thing.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.080
I'm half jewellery, anyway.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.647
That's what I always say.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.737
I'm not, though.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.044
- It's a joke.
- Ma'am.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.786
Her majesty herself just a
second ago sat on these scales.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.312
And she was very insistent
that everyone joins in.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.924
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- This is my first sandringham duty.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.318
To make sure everyone joins in.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.843
They said no one is above
tradition.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.020
Okay, fine.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.717
I'm in enough trouble.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.032
We have to put on three
pounds minimum before we leave

16:30.511 --> 16:32.730
to prove we enjoyed Christmas,
yes?

16:33.340 --> 16:34.863
That is the tradition.

16:35.864 --> 16:39.041
It was prince Albert in 1847
who began it.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.698
- It's meant to be a bit of fun.
- Well, it is, it's a lovely bit of fun.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.483
I'll do what I can.
But no promises.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.269
I'm always catching up, always.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.361
- They're all here, aren't they?
- Yes.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.581
Mm.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.410
What happened?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.325
A tractor broken down.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.023
-I had to help mend it. My
fingernails.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.810
- Is the bedroom cold again this year?
- Yes, it is.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.944
I always tell them.
They never listen.

17:12.988 --> 17:16.599
- Ma'am, if the bedroom's cold...
- The bedroom's always cold.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.863
It's a bit of fun. Tradition.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.996
I will have more blankets
delivered.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.303
Why don't they just
turn up the heating

17:23.346 --> 17:25.305
instead of burying everyone
in blankets?

17:25.566 --> 17:27.481
- It's every year I say it.
- Mummy?

17:27.872 --> 17:30.397
What? Oh, look at you!

17:30.440 --> 17:32.138
-Mummy, I'm cold.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.966
Who gave you this big, hilarious
coat?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.577
It's from the storeroom, ma'am.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.275
His royal highness
kept saying he was cold.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.755
Instead of heating...

17:41.060 --> 17:44.367
They've dressed you up
like Winston Churchill.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.241
Your royal highness.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.200
The family are all gathered in the
drawing room for the sandwiches.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.419
They are waiting.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.466
The sandwiches.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.948
The sandwiches. The holy
sandwiches.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.081
Good.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.387
To the sandwiches.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.955
I'll be there in a minute.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.305
Ma'am.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.946
Three days.

19:26.687 --> 19:27.862
That's it.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.180
Maggie.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.794
Oh my god. Didn't they tell you?

19:48.099 --> 19:50.798
I've got you again.
I bagged you.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.366
They gave me to you
because I insisted.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.411
Good.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.326
Hope.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.550
These are your dresses
for the whole thing.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.033
I have to run. Listen...

20:09.817 --> 20:11.297
I've left a coat in my car.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.864
I want you to clean it, sew it
up,

20:13.908 --> 20:15.170
whatever it needs.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.478
A coat from where, ma'am?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.263
Ancient history.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.656
Whose ancient history?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.440
Spencer.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.718
I was always last back.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.546
Always late for everything.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.985
I'd get home half an
hour after the others and...

20:48.029 --> 20:49.465
Everyone would just laugh.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.253
I'd actually forgotten all
about the scarecrow until today.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.994
I can't believe
he's still watching over us.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.476
How can he watch us?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.612
Ma'am, they're about
to open the presents.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.874
Yes, coming.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.746
Mummy,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.576
why do we have to open our
presents on Christmas Eve?

21:14.621 --> 21:16.753
Why not Christmas day
like everybody else?

21:17.754 --> 21:20.496
- You know at school you do tenses?
- Yeah.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.107
There's the past, the present,
future.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.239
Right.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.807
Well here,
there is only one tense.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.026
There is no future.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.986
The past and the present
are the same thing.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.858
Daddy told Harry
it's because father Christmas

21:34.902 --> 21:37.774
does queens and kings
the day before everybody else

21:38.209 --> 21:39.863
so that we get the best
presents.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.865
- It's true.
- He still believes it.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.171
What?

21:43.214 --> 21:45.216
Actually, that was
my little fabrication.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.740
I believe mummy.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.351
Daddy did confirm it, though.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.614
Oh, if daddy confirmed it,
then it must be true.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.268
Yes, of course it is.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
You two are both gonna
get coal for Christmas.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.796
Can we go to the house
where you used to live?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.015
It's boarded up.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.670
It's dangerous, apparently.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.150
They said,
"it's dangerous, you know?"

22:06.542 --> 22:09.110
- Aww.
- In those voices, like doors closing.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.894
Did granny order that?

22:12.722 --> 22:14.550
Ma'am, the others are waiting.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.031
Okay, you go. I'll join
you in a minute. Come on.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.644
Do you like them
getting cross with you?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.037
Yes, terribly.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.039
Mummy,

22:25.082 --> 22:26.257
what's happened?

22:26.954 --> 22:28.477
It's Christmas.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.436
Everything waits until after
Christmas.

22:30.827 --> 22:31.915
Go on.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.667
Fuck.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.346
There.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.407
What do you think?

23:29.059 --> 23:31.061
Very beautiful, your royal
highness.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.497
Mm.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.505
- It's Martha, isn't it?
- Maria, ma'am.

23:39.548 --> 23:40.593
Oh.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.988
My husband doesn't know it,
but...

23:46.381 --> 23:47.904
I saw a photo and...

23:48.209 --> 23:50.646
She was wearing
exactly the same pearls.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.389
He bought exactly the same for
her.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.131
But he doesn't even realise.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.744
It's why I left them.

24:01.788 --> 24:02.963
As a gesture.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.142
They are beautiful.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.886
It's not the pearls' fault, is
it?

24:12.929 --> 24:14.757
-No, ma'am.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.979
If I gave them to you,
would you take them?

24:23.549 --> 24:24.550
No.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.659
No, she couldn't possibly
think of it, ma'am.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.773
I'm told there's a dress
to go with them.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.296
I'm told it's all set.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.603
You know? All set.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.477
As if everything's already
happened.

25:39.886 --> 25:44.020
Papa, didn't you say that we Spencers
were distantly related to Anne boleyn?

25:46.022 --> 25:47.502
Yes, I read all about her.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.461
They even wrote a poem.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.770
"She married the king of england

25:55.423 --> 25:57.251
"and the king chopped off her
head

25:58.687 --> 26:00.297
"because he met another woman

26:01.516 --> 26:03.083
"and wanted her to be queen...

26:04.737 --> 26:05.868
"Instead."

26:42.078 --> 26:43.166
Who is it?

26:43.427 --> 26:44.690
It's Maggie, ma'am.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.606
Well, come.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.304
Emergency.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.962
Gosh, thank god it's you.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.703
Look.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.618
Emergency, why? It looks
beautiful.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.708
- But it doesn't fit.
- Have you tried it on?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.231
No, with my mood.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.407
It... it doesn't fit in with my
mood.

27:06.886 --> 27:10.454
Should be black.
Black, to contrast the pearls.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.855
Not only did I rescue
it from a scarecrow,

27:20.595 --> 27:22.031
I'm talking to it.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.556
All rumours
of my disintegration confirmed.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.563
You know, the dust in this
house...

27:34.827 --> 27:37.719
Almost certainly contains the dead skin
of every person who's ever stayed in it.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.614
This was once queen Victoria's
room.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.661
So it will have her skin
floating in the air.

27:44.532 --> 27:47.013
She wore black for forty years
after her husband died.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.103
That's love, isn't it?

27:50.146 --> 27:53.323
Well, there's no need to wear
black because no one has died.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.721
- I've put on weight.
- No, you've lost weight.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.593
There's up or down.
It's not an issue of debate.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.639
Remember, we used to talk.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.511
They fill your eggs with princes
and ride away.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.862
That's fine.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.646
It's just fine.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.952
Oh, fuck it.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.737
I will wear the dress.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.826
With the pearls.

28:17.870 --> 28:18.958
Good.

28:19.523 --> 28:20.699
Good choice.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.199
Because I'm too weak
to insist on black.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.354
-Please.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.431
- It will be fine.
- Yes, it will be fine.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.142
Good.

28:29.533 --> 28:32.232
You'll be in the world,
in some pub. Laughing.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.888
And I will be in a field
full of fucking landmines.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.369
So stand very still and smile a
lot.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.242
In this house,
everyone can hear everything.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.548
Yes, even your thoughts.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.811
Who is that new chap?

28:46.594 --> 28:48.117
He can read your thoughts.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.772
Yes,
they're getting quite serious.

28:50.816 --> 28:54.123
- About?
- They're getting serious about you.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.822
It is concern.

28:57.431 --> 28:58.780
Yes, concern.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.304
Suggesting compassion.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.959
Why wouldn't they be concerned?

29:04.612 --> 29:05.874
I'm half gone.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.094
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

29:10.226 --> 29:11.837
Today, I nearly just...

29:12.838 --> 29:14.448
Nearly just kept driving.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.367
This year they insisted on
weighing me.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.067
Just a bit of fun.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.330
They can't change.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.637
You have to change.

29:30.638 --> 29:33.772
I mean, the weighing,
yes, that is just that.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.035
A bit of fun.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.777
-But don't see conspiracy
everywhere.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.562
Don't behave the way
the say you behave.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.738
You make it easy for them.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.219
Easy for them to do what?

29:46.959 --> 29:47.960
Well, say it.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.049
Just look gorgeous.

29:50.701 --> 29:53.400
I know about the pearls. I
know he gave the same to her.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.055
I understand
why you're like this.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.538
- It's deliberate.
- No, no.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.062
He just forgets.

30:03.714 --> 30:04.977
But wear them anyway.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.458
And in your beauty,
he will remember.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.070
I don't care
if he fucking remembers.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.160
Then only remember
you're beautiful.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.597
Don't let that go.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.512
Beauty is useless.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.558
Beauty is clothing.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.353
Prepare the tureens, warm the
bowls. Please. Hush, hush, no noise.

30:33.396 --> 30:36.530
Stay on on your feet!

30:36.573 --> 30:38.053
They can hear us.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.577
-Pitter, patter, soft words.

30:40.621 --> 30:45.147
Fingers out of saucers, you
sons and you daughters of bitches.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.847
And we blanch the nettles
or they will sting us.

30:51.458 --> 30:55.854
Brigade, we make everything
the best it can be.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.726
I want our Princess of wales

31:00.075 --> 31:01.511
to want something.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.123
Service.

36:19.829 --> 36:20.874
Ma'am?

36:21.309 --> 36:22.528
It's dessert.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.574
- They're waiting for you.
- Yes, I know.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.657
Still hungry, ma'am?

37:59.581 --> 38:00.930
Who are you...

38:01.366 --> 38:02.584
Exactly?

38:04.238 --> 38:06.598
I'm usually at Clarence house,
drafted in for this occasion.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.373
I'm the queen mother's equerry.

38:11.637 --> 38:12.768
Before that?

38:14.683 --> 38:17.077
I was an officer. In a
regiment called the black watch.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.688
And that's what you do.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.385
You watch.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.998
Mostly I'm here because of the
press.

38:26.478 --> 38:30.220
It was felt we needed to be on
guard because of all the silly attention

38:30.482 --> 38:32.658
that your royal highness is
attracting.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.312
Yes, I'm a magnet for madness.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.184
Other people's madness.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.665
I have military experience.

38:39.708 --> 38:44.539
Part of my remit is the security within
the grounds of sandringham house.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.933
To keep photographers away.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.109
Foreigners, you know?

38:51.067 --> 38:53.331
One of the men reported
back today that they saw you

38:53.374 --> 38:55.811
dressing and undressing
with your curtains open.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.772
If there had been a
photographer...

39:02.165 --> 39:03.384
Now you really watch.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.214
I watch to make sure
that others do not see.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.479
Their lenses are terribly
powerful these days, ma'am.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.395
Their lenses are more
like microscopes, actually.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.660
And I am the insect in the dish.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.230
You see, they're pulling
my wings and my legs off.

39:24.318 --> 39:27.234
One by one.
Making notes on how I react.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.500
"Oh, she really does make
a fuss this one, doesn't she?"

39:34.676 --> 39:36.069
Not like Anne boleyn...

39:38.027 --> 39:41.248
Who offered her head to
the tweezers with such grace.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.601
I just wanted to be sure
you were feeling all right.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.822
And give you that word of
warning.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.346
I will feel all right.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.654
If you go away. Please.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.395
Very well.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.440
But please...

39:59.832 --> 40:02.312
- Keep your curtains...
- Close my curtains.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.184
Yes.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.405
Maybe.

40:08.667 --> 40:09.668
No.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.628
Depending on lots of things.
Hmm.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.418
-Oh.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.724
It's gone midnight.

40:23.508 --> 40:24.509
So...

40:25.640 --> 40:26.989
Happy Christmas.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.817
Happy Christmas.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.980
-Who is this?

41:45.024 --> 41:46.721
Hands on your head!

41:47.330 --> 41:48.984
-Sorry.

41:49.028 --> 41:50.029
It's me.

41:52.814 --> 41:54.512
Your royal highness, apologies.

41:54.555 --> 41:55.991
We thought you were...

41:56.035 --> 41:58.472
Can I take my hands off my head?

41:58.951 --> 42:01.301
-Of course. Sorry, ma'am.

42:01.344 --> 42:02.607
I used to live there.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.478
I grew up there.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.568
Came to have a look.

42:07.612 --> 42:11.267
Ma'am, according to the rules, if we
have an encounter, we have to report it.

42:11.790 --> 42:12.921
With me?

42:13.443 --> 42:14.880
With anyone.

42:14.923 --> 42:17.883
I'd like it if you didn't
report this encounter.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.102
Just...

42:20.581 --> 42:22.017
Say you saw a ghost.

42:23.149 --> 42:25.194
Are you warm enough, ma'am?

42:25.630 --> 42:26.892
Not really.

42:27.980 --> 42:29.634
They won't turn the heating up.

42:32.724 --> 42:34.943
- I'll go back.
- We'll escort you.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.816
- Why?
- There are photographers.

42:38.164 --> 42:41.646
Well, perhaps they just want to
take photos of what's really going on.

42:42.342 --> 42:44.300
2323, anyone there?

42:44.823 --> 42:45.824
Joe, is anyone there?

42:46.389 --> 42:48.043
No, nothing at all.

42:48.435 --> 42:49.828
No one, all clear.

43:27.953 --> 43:29.781
Mummy, you're freezing.

43:31.739 --> 43:33.349
I tried to escape.

43:33.393 --> 43:34.612
Got captured.

43:38.441 --> 43:39.660
This one's for you.

43:42.054 --> 43:44.099
- What is it?
- Not telling you.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.929
Open it in the morning. Christmas
morning, like normal people.

43:48.495 --> 43:50.497
-Don't tell anyone.

43:50.540 --> 43:53.761
- Okay.
- I can hear you both talking, you know?

43:55.633 --> 43:57.635
- And I'm still cold.
- Oh.

43:58.331 --> 44:00.072
When you're cold,

44:00.115 --> 44:01.639
you light a fire.

44:04.772 --> 44:05.860
For you.

44:08.994 --> 44:10.648
-Let's play. Come on.

44:11.518 --> 44:12.650
Attention.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.828
I'll be the major.
You be the soldiers.

44:17.916 --> 44:19.308
This game is silly.

44:19.352 --> 44:21.528
Because you're hopeless at it.

44:21.571 --> 44:22.703
Soldier William.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.751
Best thing
about Christmas so far?

44:27.665 --> 44:29.797
- Best thing... - And
it has to be the truth.

44:30.406 --> 44:33.540
Best thing about Christmas so
far is being with the family, sir.

44:35.411 --> 44:37.892
Soldier,
I said I wanted the truth.

44:37.936 --> 44:39.633
- Soldier.
- Sorry, sir.

44:40.329 --> 44:41.417
Presents, sir.

44:43.115 --> 44:45.435
Sir, presents are the only
good thing about Christmas, sir.

44:46.118 --> 44:47.946
- Not if you can't open them.
- That's true.

44:49.643 --> 44:52.124
Soldier Harry.
Best part of Christmas so far?

44:52.428 --> 44:54.735
And I know I'll get
the truth from you, sir.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.346
When you arrived, mummy, sir.

44:59.131 --> 45:01.220
- Thank you, sir.
- My turn.

45:01.786 --> 45:03.744
Major William to soldier Diana.

45:04.005 --> 45:06.312
Tell the major what's happened
to make you so sad.

45:07.182 --> 45:09.010
Sir.
Don't know what you mean, sir.

45:09.358 --> 45:12.187
-I want the truth, soldier.

45:12.231 --> 45:13.319
Sir.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.495
The past, sir.

45:15.843 --> 45:17.758
I think it's the
present, soldier.

45:20.152 --> 45:21.806
I think it's in the future.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.899
Mummy, I actually have
to open this or I'll be sick.

45:28.290 --> 45:30.205
For god's sake, then open it.

45:33.252 --> 45:35.297
Major William to soldier Diana.

45:35.950 --> 45:38.257
Um... what's your favourite
colour?

45:38.300 --> 45:40.215
- What... what's your favourite...
- Sir, pink.

45:40.259 --> 45:41.956
No, um... favourite food?

45:42.000 --> 45:46.352
Um... pink, pink... um...
Hippopotamus cake, spotted.

45:46.831 --> 45:49.398
- What's your favourite animal, soldier?
- Oh...

45:52.619 --> 45:54.882
- Lobster.
- Why did you get me a lobster?

45:55.491 --> 45:58.930
Um... because it's red
like your cheeks, sir.

45:58.973 --> 46:03.456
And it was flown from... um...

46:03.499 --> 46:06.198
It was flown from
Santa's home all the way...

46:06.241 --> 46:07.460
-Um...

46:07.503 --> 46:09.854
It's... it's Santa's... lobster.

46:09.897 --> 46:11.594
It's Santa's lobster, sir.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.727
I wanted the truth!

46:15.511 --> 46:17.551
It's all the way from the
north pole. She flew here.

46:17.862 --> 46:20.212
- You have wings?
- Definitely.

46:20.734 --> 46:22.867
- Soldier William.
- Ah.

46:23.432 --> 46:25.304
Your perfect, perfect Christmas.

46:25.347 --> 46:26.958
Tell me all about it.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.308
My perfect, perfect Christmas,
sir,

46:29.351 --> 46:32.572
is not following the rules
and doing whatever you want.

46:32.615 --> 46:35.662
- Eating with your hands.
- Not showing up.

46:36.141 --> 46:38.099
What would that be like?

46:38.143 --> 46:39.535
That would be a miracle.

46:41.189 --> 46:43.104
We've never had
a miracle before.

46:43.670 --> 46:45.150
Don't know what it's like.

46:46.107 --> 46:48.631
Soldier.
Do you want to be king, soldier?

46:51.983 --> 46:53.201
I have no choice.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.684
Do you want to be the queen,
soldier?

46:59.164 --> 47:00.426
I'll be your mum.

47:01.340 --> 47:02.515
That's my job.

47:03.298 --> 47:04.734
Do you get paid?

47:06.258 --> 47:07.389
Hardly.

47:08.869 --> 47:10.871
If I start being really silly
in the next few days,

47:11.916 --> 47:13.004
just tell me.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.529
I'll only believe it
if it's you who tells me.

47:16.572 --> 47:18.009
Okay, mummy.

47:18.052 --> 47:19.401
Sure can do.

47:52.521 --> 47:53.740
Who is it?

47:53.783 --> 47:55.829
Your dresser,
your royal highness.

48:07.449 --> 48:08.798
Where's Maggie?

48:09.103 --> 48:10.931
I have dressed you before,
ma'am.

48:10.975 --> 48:12.106
Yes, I know.

48:12.411 --> 48:13.629
May I come in?

48:14.282 --> 48:15.588
Where's Maggie?

48:16.284 --> 48:19.157
I believe major Gregory
sent her back to London.

48:34.128 --> 48:35.913
It's very cold this morning.

48:49.448 --> 48:50.753
This is for breakfast.

48:52.451 --> 48:55.106
The next outfit,
the one you chose for church...

48:55.149 --> 48:58.326
I suggest you wear
a warm merino long coat.

49:00.763 --> 49:01.939
How do I look?

49:03.114 --> 49:04.419
What do you mean?

49:04.985 --> 49:07.248
Right now, how do I look?

49:07.857 --> 49:08.989
Very nice.

49:10.338 --> 49:11.339
Hmm.

49:13.211 --> 49:15.517
- Happy Christmas.
- Oh!

49:16.214 --> 49:19.086
- Happy Christmas...
- "... Christmas, ma'am." "Very nice."

49:19.608 --> 49:21.784
I'd really like to have someone
I can talk to properly.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.656
When is Maggie back?

49:23.699 --> 49:25.677
- I really don't know, ma'am.
- That will be all. Thank you.

49:25.701 --> 49:27.355
I'm sorry?

49:27.399 --> 49:29.333
There's a designated dress
which I will put on for breakfast.

49:29.357 --> 49:30.924
And I can put it on myself.

49:31.751 --> 49:33.405
Your hair isn't set, ma'am.

49:37.061 --> 49:38.584
Tell them I want Maggie.

49:40.586 --> 49:43.466
Tell major Gregory, who hears
everything, that I insist on having Maggie.

49:45.069 --> 49:47.419
It isn't really major Gregory
who decides.

49:47.854 --> 49:50.248
No, he doesn't decide. There's
never a decision to make.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.032
There's only what must happen.

49:52.337 --> 49:53.555
But even so...

49:54.904 --> 49:57.124
Tell them I insist
on having Maggie.

50:04.305 --> 50:07.308
Or I'll cut all my dresses to
pieces with a kitchen knife.

50:11.182 --> 50:12.531
Yes, ma'am.

50:13.053 --> 50:15.969
-Wait, don't say that.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.318
No, I don't mean that.

50:17.797 --> 50:18.928
Don't say that.

50:18.972 --> 50:21.061
Just say that I'd like Maggie.

50:22.976 --> 50:24.238
Though you're good,

50:25.196 --> 50:26.501
I would prefer...

50:27.154 --> 50:28.590
I would like Maggie.

50:29.287 --> 50:31.506
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

51:11.938 --> 51:15.420
Your majesties, your royal
highnesses, smile, please.

51:22.035 --> 51:25.517
This will be followed by
coddled eggs with cream sauce,

51:25.560 --> 51:27.910
Scottish kippers, brown and
white toast.

51:28.215 --> 51:30.478
Accompanied by simmered herring
roe,

51:30.522 --> 51:34.047
roasted muffins, quince jelly.
Followed by fresh...

51:34.091 --> 51:35.570
This will be
followed by fresh coffee

51:35.875 --> 51:38.791
with a selection of
organic pastries and cakes

51:38.834 --> 51:40.532
from highgrove house,

51:40.575 --> 51:44.013
a selection of organic highgrove
jams and marmalades with honey

51:44.623 --> 51:45.928
from highgrove bees.

51:46.538 --> 51:49.193
Then, at ten o'clock precisely,

51:49.454 --> 51:51.369
cars will take all those
concerned

51:51.412 --> 51:54.720
to St. Mary magdalene's church
for traditional morning worship.

51:55.547 --> 51:56.809
But now,

51:57.679 --> 51:59.812
enjoy your breakfast, your
majesty.

52:05.905 --> 52:07.036
How do I look?

52:10.039 --> 52:11.215
You look fine.

52:14.783 --> 52:17.351
There is... one thing.

52:20.441 --> 52:23.183
The chickens laid the eggs,

52:24.228 --> 52:25.968
the fishermen caught the fish,

52:27.100 --> 52:29.755
all these little bees made the
honey...

52:30.538 --> 52:33.802
They all made such an
effort to bring you breakfast.

52:34.629 --> 52:35.978
Please,

52:36.022 --> 52:39.112
do them the courtesy
of not regurgitating it all

52:39.156 --> 52:42.507
into a lavatory bowl before
the church bells even ring.

52:49.601 --> 52:52.691
The peace of god,
which passeth all understanding,

52:53.126 --> 52:56.782
shall keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love of god

52:57.043 --> 52:59.785
and of his son,
Jesus Christ our lord.

53:00.655 --> 53:05.051
And the blessings of god almighty,
the father, the son and holy ghost

53:05.617 --> 53:08.315
be amongst you
and remain with you always.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.839
- Amen.
- Amen.

53:34.907 --> 53:36.125
Come here.

53:37.823 --> 53:39.085
Thanks for the crab.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.696
-It's awful.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.003
I got it at the petrol station.

53:44.699 --> 53:46.048
It's Christmas.

53:46.092 --> 53:48.399
-It's the thought that counts.

53:58.974 --> 54:01.150
Did you tell anyone? Mm?

54:01.716 --> 54:03.109
No.

54:03.152 --> 54:05.242
-I told Harry to hide his
lobster.

54:05.285 --> 54:06.504
But he lost it anyway.

54:07.331 --> 54:08.462
Of course.

54:08.984 --> 54:10.159
Well, that's okay.

54:11.857 --> 54:13.313
There's lots of crustaceans
to be had at the petrol station.

54:13.337 --> 54:14.555
- Mm?
- Yeah.

54:20.518 --> 54:22.476
- You cold?
- Mm-hmm.

54:23.129 --> 54:25.174
- Yeah.
- Almost.

54:29.353 --> 54:31.180
-Diana!

54:31.224 --> 54:32.443
Diana!

54:33.792 --> 54:36.098
Look this way. Give us a smile.

54:36.142 --> 54:37.796
And William! Will!

54:49.286 --> 54:51.418
Look this way. There she is.

55:12.047 --> 55:13.353
Diana!

55:15.137 --> 55:17.357
The public began arriving
early this morning...

55:17.401 --> 55:19.403
Look,
she's wearing the wrong one.

55:19.446 --> 55:23.232
She's wearing "boxing day lunch"
when it should be "Christmas day church."

55:23.755 --> 55:26.888
Does it really matter that she's,
um, swapping them around?

55:26.932 --> 55:28.150
And those crowds...

55:28.194 --> 55:29.978
I mean, do you think
I should tell someone?

55:30.022 --> 55:32.111
They might think
it's me making mistakes.

55:32.503 --> 55:35.027
Oh, no. Oh, don't worry.

55:35.462 --> 55:37.377
As the royal familyturned out...

55:37.421 --> 55:40.424
They'll know it's not you
who's making mistakes.

55:40.467 --> 55:41.903
The Duke of Edinburgh.

55:42.904 --> 55:44.732
"Oh death rock me to sleep

55:46.168 --> 55:47.648
"bring me to quiet rest

55:48.910 --> 55:51.348
"let pass my weary, guiltless
ghost

55:52.610 --> 55:54.263
"out of my careful breast."

56:00.966 --> 56:02.184
Diana.

56:06.058 --> 56:07.842
Oh death, rock me to sleep.

56:38.351 --> 56:39.396
Pull!

56:46.533 --> 56:47.578
Pull!

57:02.070 --> 57:03.550
You have to say "pull."

57:04.029 --> 57:06.466
- Pull.
- Don't whisper it, say it loud.

57:07.424 --> 57:08.425
Pull!

57:13.517 --> 57:14.648
Again.

57:15.562 --> 57:16.607
Pull!

57:23.788 --> 57:27.313
You've got... you've got
24 hours. Just teach him.

57:27.356 --> 57:29.489
You move with the bird,
you aim for the beak.

57:29.533 --> 57:30.838
Okay.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.450
One in three would be bearable.

57:37.018 --> 57:39.562
William told me before we came
here he didn't want to shoot guns.

57:39.586 --> 57:42.459
I want to talk because someone
aid something about clothes.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.132
- Will he be all right?
- Yes, of course he'll be alright.

57:44.156 --> 57:46.419
Your dresser said something
about clothes.

57:46.811 --> 57:48.160
I mean, will he be safe?

57:48.203 --> 57:50.467
It's perfectly safe,
you wear protective glasses.

57:51.816 --> 57:53.470
How can it be safe

57:53.513 --> 57:55.559
if you have to wear protective
glasses?

57:56.037 --> 57:58.997
Yesterday,
you arrived after the queen.

57:59.693 --> 58:01.565
- I got lost.
- How could you get lost?

58:01.608 --> 58:03.436
You've lived over the hill for
years.

58:04.045 --> 58:05.394
It looks different now.

58:06.134 --> 58:07.614
Everything looks different.

58:08.963 --> 58:10.356
Except the scarecrow.

58:10.399 --> 58:13.315
Yes, she says you took
a jacket off a scarecrow.

58:14.795 --> 58:16.231
It was a bit of fun.

58:18.277 --> 58:21.117
You sure you weren't late yesterday
because you were delayed by someone?

58:21.889 --> 58:23.151
Someone?

58:23.195 --> 58:24.995
I just thought
someone might have delayed you.

58:26.241 --> 58:27.460
No.

58:29.331 --> 58:32.117
Sometimes you get delayed
by someone.

58:33.205 --> 58:34.511
No one says anything.

58:36.121 --> 58:38.142
It's perfectly acceptable for
you to be delayed by someone.

58:38.166 --> 58:39.970
How can you ask if it's safe?
It's a tradition.

58:39.994 --> 58:41.822
Why did you send Maggie away?

58:41.866 --> 58:44.042
They said
she left the curtains open.

58:44.085 --> 58:45.391
I left the curtains open.

58:46.871 --> 58:49.221
They are circling us.
Didn't you know? Don't you read?

58:49.569 --> 58:52.311
They're hungry for anything. Why
are you swapping dresses around?

58:54.443 --> 58:56.358
Why would you think
I got delayed by someone?

58:56.402 --> 58:57.838
Oh, come on, come on.

59:02.147 --> 59:04.889
- He said he didn't want to shoot yet.
- He's old enough.

59:06.238 --> 59:08.457
And you want him
to shoot real birds tomorrow?

59:08.501 --> 59:09.981
For god's sake.

59:12.636 --> 59:13.854
Also...

59:14.638 --> 59:17.031
One of major Gregory's men
said he saw you

59:17.336 --> 59:19.860
wandering around
in the grounds last night.

59:21.166 --> 59:22.820
I wanted to see my house.

59:22.863 --> 59:25.605
The police caught you
but didn't report it.

59:25.649 --> 59:27.085
Gregory's men saw you too.

59:27.128 --> 59:29.391
- They're better than the police.
- I wanted to go home.

59:29.435 --> 59:33.134
- It's boarded up.
- Yes, but I wish it would be unboarded.

59:33.178 --> 59:35.138
But if I wish it aloud
it definitely won't happen.

59:35.180 --> 59:37.878
You talk like a baby
who isn't being spoilt enough.

59:40.707 --> 59:42.404
I would like it

59:42.448 --> 59:45.233
if you didn't make him
shoot real birds tomorrow.

59:46.234 --> 59:47.627
And I would like it

59:49.586 --> 59:52.347
if you didn't buy me pearls because
you bought us both the same thing.

59:56.288 --> 59:58.029
And if they're circling...

59:58.943 --> 01:00:01.249
It seems they're circling just
me.

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:02.859
Not you.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:04.992
Just me.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.846
Perhaps because I always
take care to close my curtains.

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:27.624
Look.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.150
The thing is, Diana,
there has to be two of you.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:38.373
You... there's... there's two of me,
there's two of father, two of everyone.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.506
There's the real one,

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.857
and the one they take pictures
of.

01:00:48.122 --> 01:00:49.950
Now, we are given tasks.

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.519
You know, I...
I hated to shoot at first.

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:56.478
I gave my gun to the other one,
but...

01:00:57.218 --> 01:01:00.004
But you know, you have
to be able to make your...

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.701
Body do things...

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:03.702
You hate.

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:06.706
That you hate?

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:11.058
- That you hate.
- That you hate?

01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:14.192
Yes.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.979
For the good of the country.

01:01:21.634 --> 01:01:23.854
- Of the country?
- Yes, the people.

01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.813
Because they don't want us
to be people.

01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.035
That's how it is.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.561
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:58.192
So please, stick to
the list as it is written,

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.194
in the order that it is written.

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:03.502
- The dresser gets upset.
- I want Maggie back.

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:06.374
Someone heard Maggie saying
she thinks you're cracking up.

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.812
-What?

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:11.858
Yes, everyone here
hears everything.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:15.383
They just don't always
tell you what they've heard.

01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:27.837
This can be an opportunity to
reflect on our own good fortune

01:02:28.657 --> 01:02:30.790
and on whether we have
anything to offer,

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.183
by way of example,

01:02:34.098 --> 01:02:36.274
to those who have recently
broken free of dictatorship.

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:39.190
We, who claim to
be of the free world,

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:42.846
should examine what we
really mean by freedom.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.023
And how we can help to ensure

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:49.243
that once in place,
it is there to stay.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:54.292
There are all sorts of
elements to a free society.

01:02:56.076 --> 01:02:58.426
But I believe that among
the most important

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.342
is the willingness of
ordinary men and women...

01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:04.345
-Good girl.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.048
Your majesty.

01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:21.536
I really like the dress
you wore on television.

01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:26.411
Wasn't the one
my dresser recommended.

01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:30.850
They take a lot of
photographs of you, don't they?

01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:36.290
The only portrait that really matters is
the one they put on the ten pound note.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:39.380
When they take that one,
you understand all you are,

01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:40.773
my dear, is currency.

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.864
-Come on.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:03.274
The Turkey and the goose will
be accompanied by the following:

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:07.452
Plum sauce, bread sauce,
cranberry sauce, cloudberry sauce,

01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:10.150
potatoes, carrots and spinach.

01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:12.892
Three plums for the prince of
wales.

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:14.459
Organic carrots.

01:04:14.502 --> 01:04:16.437
Please, be careful which
box we take the carrots from

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:18.202
because he will bloody check.

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:21.335
Parsnips, again organic.

01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:24.295
-Okay, on to dessert.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:27.776
We have soufflé d'abricots,
bread and butter pudding,

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.258
a Christmas pudding
chocolate yule log, plum pudding,

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.739
mince pies, raspberry croquets,

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:36.655
pastries, fondants,
chocolate mousses,

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:40.746
whitechocolate mousses,
crème brûlée.

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:44.968
Finally, a selection of sweet
and savoury organic biscuits.

01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:46.795
Organic biscuits from?

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.623
Highgrove, chef!

01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.364
Yes,

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.453
yes, bloody highgrove.

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:56.805
Right. Okay, the time now
is ten minutes past three.

01:04:56.849 --> 01:04:59.243
Dinner will be served
at eight P.M. precisely...

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.614
What happens to the pheasants?

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:28.416
What happens to the pheasants
that my son will be shooting?

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:32.450
After the shoot...

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.105
We'll dress them
and we'll pluck them and...

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.759
Everyone will take a brace
home with them.

01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:41.328
There will be lots left over.

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:45.796
The staff get some, the dogs get
some, and the rest is thrown away.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.596
Thrown away...

01:05:50.859 --> 01:05:54.515
The pheasants are bred to be shot, ma'am.
But for the gun, they wouldn't be there.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:57.779
And the ones that don't get
shot, they just get run over.

01:05:57.823 --> 01:05:59.651
They're not the brightest of
birds.

01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:02.132
Beautiful but not very bright.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.136
Did you read
the vogue article about me?

01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:11.402
I've put soufflé d'abricots on
the menu for you, your favourite.

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:13.970
And I will make it myself for
you.

01:06:16.885 --> 01:06:17.974
Fine.

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.545
Do you mind?

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.290
I've been reading
about Anne boleyn.

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:31.899
Oh.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.729
I never remember which one is
which.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:38.516
She's the one who was beheaded
by king Henry viii.

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:41.736
Because he said
that she was having an affair.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.783
But in fact he was the one
who was having the affair.

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:48.178
I think I saw her.

01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:50.615
The ghost of her.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:54.140
Everything you say to any member
of staff here becomes currency.

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:57.274
Do you understand? It becomes
currency in these rooms.

01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:58.971
Good.

01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:00.799
Excellent.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.584
I'm prepared for my future

01:07:03.628 --> 01:07:06.413
as a face on a coin
to be passed from hand to hand.

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:07.936
No.

01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:10.026
You don't even think that.

01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.899
Did Maggie say
that I was cracking up?

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:16.554
Which one's Maggie?

01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:23.169
I thought she was my friend.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:26.433
Did she say it?

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:28.087
I... I don't listen.

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:29.523
I just cook.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:35.529
Some things are best
not said out loud.

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.924
Stories of ghosts,

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:41.709
cutting off of heads and any
odd thing that you might say,

01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:43.363
they get repeated here.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.193
But if I don't say it out loud,
they read it on my face.

01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:50.544
- They can all see into me.
- Ma'am.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:53.808
Usually when they
sit at these tables and talk,

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.201
they're laughing.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.031
At all the oddness
and all the scandals.

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:04.123
But with you, they do not laugh.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.867
They're gentle with you.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.304
And they're kind.

01:08:12.653 --> 01:08:14.307
And they are worried.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.225
They want you to survive.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.578
As the person you were when
you first came here ten years ago.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:33.020
Do you have access
to wire cutters?

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:37.287
Why do you want wire cutters,
Diana?

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:39.419
To cut wire.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.178
Oh, go on.

01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.049
Fly away.

01:09:03.008 --> 01:09:04.401
Before it's too late.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.322
If you are going to fly anywhere,
may I recommend Kensington?

01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:16.500
They wouldn't shoot you there.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.372
They'd make a fuss
of your beautiful feathers.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.245
Look at the colours, they'd say.

01:09:23.898 --> 01:09:26.814
And everyone would start
wearing feathers just like yours.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.316
You're so lucky, because
you can wear the same outfit.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.428
Forgive me, ma'am,

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.343
but you need to get ready for
dinner.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.736
It's almost five.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.523
Dinner's at eight.

01:09:41.002 --> 01:09:43.004
Your dresser needs to dress
you ma'am. Come, come.

01:09:43.048 --> 01:09:44.354
I'll be along shortly.

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:58.759
Ma'am, may I?

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:09.509
You know,
some years ago I was in Belfast.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.338
The falls road.

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:14.035
Sour times back then.

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:16.560
We were in an alley.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.562
About to cross...

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.912
I had a good friend beside me.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:22.783
A good friend.

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:25.852
Soldiers become more
than friends, you know?

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:30.922
Anyway, to stop our legs from
shaking, he was telling me a story.

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:33.838
He was brought up in a farm
up in the highlands and he was...

01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:35.535
He was talking about some horse

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:38.364
that his father had bought at
the fair that couldn't be tamed.

01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:41.237
Lots of funny stories

01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:45.241
about this wild horse throwing
his brothers around and such.

01:10:45.502 --> 01:10:46.764
But then he said...

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:49.332
"But then,

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.551
one fine morning..."

01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:56.730
In that moment, the bullet hit
him.

01:10:56.774 --> 01:11:00.560
Back of the head, out through
his nose. And he fell onto me and...

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.432
I hugged him.

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:03.824
Close.

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:06.697
Saved myself from the next
bullet.

01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:08.916
Hmm.

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:12.964
Never did find out what
happened to that wild horse.

01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:17.229
I asked myself,
who do we soldiers die for?

01:11:22.103 --> 01:11:23.888
Then I remembered my oath.

01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:28.458
We all make
an oath of loyalty to the crown.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:31.461
It's not the human beings, you
see?

01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:35.160
But it's the oath you chose to
believe.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:39.730
Their faults, their weaknesses,
that's not what you think about

01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:41.775
when you're in an alley
in the falls road.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.952
You think only about your oath.

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.780
And what that means.

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:51.655
I don't want anyone to die for
me.

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:55.702
And I hope your friend's wild
horse

01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:58.662
was never tamed.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:05.321
Ma'am.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:09.063
I've been asked to ensure

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.152
that this time,

01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:13.459
unlike your arrival at the
house,

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:15.679
you arrive for dinner on time.

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:20.248
It is her majesty and the house
of windsor I am pledged to serve.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.294
And I speak with their voice.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:25.950
So please, there really is
no time for indulgence, ma'am.

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:32.696
It was you who put the book
on my bed.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.873
What book?

01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:38.702
You put it there as a warning.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:43.097
I really have no idea what
you are talking about, ma'am.

01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:38.849
Ma'am, there seems
to have been some confusion

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.981
about which dress to wear and
when.

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:45.072
Yes, you reported my confusion
faithfully.

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:47.988
Perhaps you've taken an oath.

01:13:52.732 --> 01:13:55.126
The curtains
have been fastened, ma'am.

01:13:55.953 --> 01:13:59.043
That is, I was told to sew them
by his royal highness.

01:13:59.086 --> 01:14:02.002
There have been reports
of people in the grounds.

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:19.585
They think photographers.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.022
We thought it wise.

01:14:22.936 --> 01:14:24.242
Yes, it is wise.

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:27.724
- For Christmas dinner.
- It's very wise...

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:28.986
I took it in.

01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:31.554
You have lost weight.

01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:34.078
Shall we try it on?

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.473
Ma'am, I will help you.

01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.955
How can you help me?

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:12.899
I thought at first it might not
fit me.

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.336
But it does.

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.900
There's even a little room left
in it to accommodate for dinner.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.343
There we are.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:28.915
Hmm.

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.569
Will you wear it?

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.005
Of course I will wear it.

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:36.183
It says on the label
"Christmas day dinner,"

01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:37.924
and it's Christmas day dinner.

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:39.404
What else would I wear?

01:15:42.842 --> 01:15:43.887
Now leave me.

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:46.846
I wish to masturbate.

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.023
Ma'am.

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:55.463
You can tell everyone I said
that.

01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:56.089
-Ma'am.

01:16:56.133 --> 01:16:58.918
- Dinner is served in 30 minutes.
- God.

01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:27.425
-Yes, I'm coming!

01:17:36.956 --> 01:17:37.956
Mummy?

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:41.221
-Mummy?

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:49.882
Mummy,

01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:53.358
you said to tell you
if you were being really silly.

01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:56.759
Mummy, you're being really
silly.

01:17:58.761 --> 01:17:59.761
Please.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.580
Mummy, we have to
sit down before granny.

01:18:05.028 --> 01:18:07.334
Ma'am, dinner is
served in ten minutes.

01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:08.988
Yes, we are just...

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:13.906
Mummy, just switch off your
mind.

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:16.822
Don't think about it
until after dinner.

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:18.694
For everyone's sake.

01:18:22.306 --> 01:18:24.221
The chef has made soufflé
d'abricots.

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:26.571
It's just for me.

01:18:28.051 --> 01:18:29.705
It's not for them, it's for me.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:32.490
You've got like one minute
to get dressed.

01:18:34.579 --> 01:18:35.798
You can do this.

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:39.584
That's okay because...

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:41.499
It only takes me one minute.

01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:43.980
I look great anyway.

01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:47.679
Did you see her in church?

01:18:48.854 --> 01:18:50.160
See who, mummy?

01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:54.512
Jane Seymour, of course.

01:18:56.383 --> 01:18:57.428
Mummy...

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.865
- I'll be one minute.
- Okay.

01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:02.433
Okay... one minute.

01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:07.699
I just need one minute.

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:15.533
- Just one minute. Sorry.
- No, no!

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:18.057
- It's okay, it's okay!
- No, please, mummy.

01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:44.170
Ma'am?

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:46.956
Dessert is about to be served.

01:19:49.349 --> 01:19:52.004
The soufflé d'abricots
is just for me.

01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:57.662
Ma'am, I've been told
to wait for you.

01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:01.100
That's very kind of you.

01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:03.624
Very kind...

01:20:04.887 --> 01:20:05.975
Ma'am?

01:20:09.369 --> 01:20:10.370
Diana.

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.030
Come.

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.077
Emergency!

01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:26.952
Hold on.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:28.910
Fight them.

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:31.348
Be beautiful.

01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:34.960
You are your own weapon.

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.833
Don't cut it to pieces.

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:40.661
Okay,
but you have to stay with me.

01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:43.839
You can't leave me.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:47.494
- No.
- Stay with me.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:48.843
Of course.

01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:01.247
Where is she?

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.728
-Ma'am?

01:21:06.731 --> 01:21:08.864
Ma'am, they are all waiting.

01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:45.117
Ma'am, please.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.906
Tell them I'm not well.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.954
Tell them I'm not at all well!

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.489
Tell them I am not well.

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:12.014
Tell them I'm not well.

01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:23.025
Go tell them I'm not well!

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.860
Ma'am.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.256
I need a pair of Wellingtons.
And a torch.

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.571
Thank you.

01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:50.139
Where are you going, ma'am?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:51.966
Home.

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:04.065
Sir.

01:23:05.154 --> 01:23:06.851
The Princess of wales
has gone outside.

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.636
She said she's going home.

01:23:11.247 --> 01:23:13.379
Really? How odd.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:17.838
I think that means
she's going to park house.

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:20.908
It's dangerous, sir.

01:23:20.952 --> 01:23:23.259
The stairs and the floorboards,
they're rotten.

01:23:24.086 --> 01:23:27.132
If a Princess wants to go home,
who are we to stand in her way?

01:23:30.266 --> 01:23:32.398
If the constables report
anything,

01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:34.400
tell them to let her be.

01:23:35.923 --> 01:23:37.360
That is all she wants.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.318
For us all to just...

01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:40.754
Let her be.

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.060
Yes, sir.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.595
-So.

01:28:01.537 --> 01:28:04.409
Diana! Boys! Get inside!

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:09.344
-Diana.

01:29:12.172 --> 01:29:13.812
You know he gave her
a picture of himself.

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:15.393
A miniature painting.

01:29:19.223 --> 01:29:21.268
She wore it around her neck.

01:29:25.055 --> 01:29:26.883
That I wore around my neck.

01:29:28.188 --> 01:29:29.581
So I just tore it off.

01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:33.411
Go.

01:29:35.848 --> 01:29:36.936
Run.

01:33:55.717 --> 01:33:56.935
Are you real?

01:33:58.458 --> 01:33:59.458
Yeah.

01:34:02.288 --> 01:34:03.333
Yeah.

01:34:11.558 --> 01:34:12.559
Hey.

01:34:46.593 --> 01:34:48.117
They asked me back.

01:34:49.945 --> 01:34:52.599
They said they needed someone
to talk to you.

01:34:52.643 --> 01:34:53.688
Hmm.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:34:58.997
Who is "they"?

01:34:59.868 --> 01:35:01.478
The prince of wales.

01:35:02.348 --> 01:35:04.046
That was good of him.

01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:06.048
He's not all bad.

01:35:06.657 --> 01:35:07.963
None of them are.

01:35:08.224 --> 01:35:09.268
No.

01:35:10.574 --> 01:35:12.414
They asked me to suggest
that you see a doctor.

01:35:14.186 --> 01:35:15.492
They say you've been...

01:35:15.535 --> 01:35:16.928
Cutting yourself again.

01:35:17.929 --> 01:35:19.148
Hmm.

01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:20.540
How do they know?

01:35:21.585 --> 01:35:23.456
- They know everything.
- They don't.

01:35:26.242 --> 01:35:29.245
They don't know that Anne
boleyn saved my life last night.

01:35:32.422 --> 01:35:36.165
I've been imagining how they'll
write about me in a thousand years.

01:35:37.122 --> 01:35:38.384
If you're royal,

01:35:40.299 --> 01:35:42.103
the more time that passes, the
fewer words they use to describe you.

01:35:42.127 --> 01:35:43.607
"The conqueror."

01:35:44.826 --> 01:35:47.263
"The virgin." Diana...

01:35:54.052 --> 01:35:55.706
If I ever do become queen,

01:35:56.968 --> 01:35:58.230
what will I be?

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:01.756
Insane?

01:36:07.587 --> 01:36:09.720
He said that you told someone
that...

01:36:10.155 --> 01:36:12.244
You thought I was cracking up.

01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.160
It's okay.

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.336
But did you say it?

01:36:23.821 --> 01:36:25.910
Before I answer that question,

01:36:26.345 --> 01:36:27.346
- ma'am...
- Hmm.

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.609
For what it's worth...

01:36:31.698 --> 01:36:34.738
I've never told you this and it probably
means you'll have to fire me, but...

01:36:36.747 --> 01:36:38.793
Well actually,
I'm in love with you.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:43.885
Yes, I mean...

01:36:43.928 --> 01:36:45.669
I mean in that way.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.281
Completely.

01:36:55.766 --> 01:36:59.204
So, I suppose the one word
I'd use to describe you

01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:00.466
would be "shocked."

01:37:01.903 --> 01:37:04.514
-Diana: "The shocked."

01:37:09.606 --> 01:37:10.825
Um...

01:37:11.434 --> 01:37:14.219
- Goodness.
- Yes, quite.

01:37:14.263 --> 01:37:15.830
So what do you say to that?

01:37:17.614 --> 01:37:20.443
- I...
- Shock does wonders apparently.

01:37:22.184 --> 01:37:25.013
And I know... I know you
don't see me in that way.

01:37:25.056 --> 01:37:27.842
- No, I...
- It's perfectly fine. I'm a grown-up.

01:37:31.889 --> 01:37:34.607
I just thought I'd lighten the gloom
with something totally unexpected.

01:37:34.631 --> 01:37:35.631
Bam.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.680
Just think of all the times
I've seen you naked.

01:37:45.685 --> 01:37:46.991
I'm surprised, but...

01:37:47.035 --> 01:37:48.384
Completely...

01:37:48.819 --> 01:37:50.647
I'm grown-up about... this.

01:37:51.343 --> 01:37:53.171
No, you're not. You're not.

01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:55.782
You're having a childish giggle
and I love it.

01:37:56.174 --> 01:37:58.394
Fuck doctors.
What you need is love.

01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:02.528
Love, shocks and laughter.

01:38:04.182 --> 01:38:05.357
Plenty of it.

01:38:07.185 --> 01:38:09.231
- I...
- You ready for that walk now?

01:38:29.381 --> 01:38:31.470
It's going out.
Further and further.

01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:48.400
One hour to the guns.

01:38:49.836 --> 01:38:51.403
Load the shoot boxes, please.

01:38:55.016 --> 01:38:59.368
Eggs, dairy and cheese are our
friends. Meats and oils our enemies.

01:38:59.716 --> 01:39:02.980
Remember, salt cellars
will lie down with the spices

01:39:03.328 --> 01:39:05.026
on muslin bed sheets.

01:39:28.092 --> 01:39:30.051
- Just do your best, okay?
- Yes.

01:40:28.152 --> 01:40:30.328
Park the car
in the staff car park

01:40:30.372 --> 01:40:32.504
and leave the keys
in the glove compartment.

01:40:33.201 --> 01:40:34.811
Why? What are you going to do?

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:39.294
I'm going to take my place
among the pheasants.

01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:41.991
No...

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:43.646
Seriously. What?

01:40:43.689 --> 01:40:44.821
No, seriously.

01:40:46.301 --> 01:40:48.868
Oh, Maggie, it's all
just a bit of fun, isn't it?

01:40:51.306 --> 01:40:52.306
Men.

01:40:52.524 --> 01:40:54.004
Husbands, sex.

01:40:54.918 --> 01:40:55.918
Mistresses.

01:40:56.572 --> 01:40:57.573
Deceit.

01:40:58.226 --> 01:40:59.227
Succession.

01:41:01.229 --> 01:41:02.447
It's currency.

01:41:03.796 --> 01:41:04.971
That's all we are.

01:41:05.233 --> 01:41:06.756
I like nice things

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.673
that are simple, ordinary.

01:41:11.717 --> 01:41:13.110
But things that are real.

01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:16.070
You know,
I really like things that are

01:41:16.374 --> 01:41:18.289
quite middle-class,
unfashionable.

01:41:18.724 --> 01:41:20.117
I love les mis, I love...

01:41:20.509 --> 01:41:21.771
Phantom of the opera.

01:41:22.554 --> 01:41:23.686
I love fast food.

01:41:25.122 --> 01:41:27.255
-I feel sorry for pheasants.

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.257
There's no hope for me.

01:41:29.779 --> 01:41:30.910
Not with them.

01:41:34.784 --> 01:41:36.786
I'm going to see you
back in Kensington.

01:41:37.178 --> 01:41:38.570
I can't wait.

01:41:40.311 --> 01:41:42.618
- I'll have a pheasant feather in my hat.
- Okay.

01:43:50.528 --> 01:43:52.269
Saboteur!

01:43:52.313 --> 01:43:54.837
-Hold your fire!

01:43:57.318 --> 01:43:58.449
Boys!

01:43:59.842 --> 01:44:01.626
I want to take you home.

01:44:13.986 --> 01:44:16.119
I'm not moving from this spot

01:44:16.772 --> 01:44:18.295
until they come to me!

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.002
You'll just have to shoot me!

01:44:46.236 --> 01:44:47.236
Go.

01:44:49.457 --> 01:44:50.893
You... try to help her.

01:44:54.679 --> 01:44:56.483
Your royal highness, do you
want me to intervene here?

01:44:56.507 --> 01:44:57.639
My sons...

01:44:59.423 --> 01:45:01.164
Are going to join their mother.

01:45:05.386 --> 01:45:07.301
So everyone hold your fire.

01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:09.825
Go.

01:45:34.023 --> 01:45:35.023
Yes.

01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:36.155
Okay.

01:45:36.199 --> 01:45:37.200
Oh!

01:45:46.644 --> 01:45:47.819
Come on!

01:45:47.863 --> 01:45:50.169
- Slowpoke! Slowpoke!
- Come on!

01:45:50.213 --> 01:45:52.955
- Come on!
- Do you want to be first?

01:45:53.651 --> 01:45:54.739
Come on, mummy.

01:45:58.482 --> 01:45:59.962
Hang on. Boys.

01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:03.922
Come here. Come on, come on.

01:46:05.054 --> 01:46:06.360
Feet up, feet up.

01:46:08.623 --> 01:46:10.407
-What are we?

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:12.583
Seventeen and a half stone.

01:46:13.758 --> 01:46:15.586
- There.
- Come, mummy.

01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:17.153
That's how much
I enjoyed myself.

01:46:17.196 --> 01:46:19.634
- Ma'am, shall I bring the car?
- Tell major Gregory:

01:46:19.677 --> 01:46:21.462
Seventeen and a half stone.

01:46:21.505 --> 01:46:22.506
Write it down.

01:46:24.639 --> 01:46:26.118
Right here, mummy?

01:46:26.684 --> 01:46:28.294
Are you leaving us, ma'am?

01:46:28.338 --> 01:46:30.253
Yes! Isn't it terrible?

01:46:30.296 --> 01:46:32.908
Yeah. Would you like me
to make you up some food?

01:46:32.951 --> 01:46:34.257
There's a lot left over.

01:46:34.692 --> 01:46:36.738
No, I've promised them a real
treat.

01:46:37.565 --> 01:46:39.958
-I missed your soufflé.

01:46:40.437 --> 01:46:42.744
It would've only been
wasted on me, anyway.

01:46:43.048 --> 01:46:44.180
We need the keys.

01:46:46.051 --> 01:46:47.662
There's also a note.

01:47:02.851 --> 01:47:03.939
Bye!

01:47:21.739 --> 01:47:22.958
Where are we going?

01:47:23.654 --> 01:47:24.654
Home.

01:47:26.918 --> 01:47:28.659
- I'm cold.
- And I'm hungry.

01:47:28.703 --> 01:47:31.096
Well, turn the heating up!
We're going to eat.

01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:36.101
Where are we going to eat?

01:47:36.145 --> 01:47:37.407
Somewhere!

01:47:37.668 --> 01:47:39.496
- Do you know?
- Trust me!

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:41.716
- Do you know?
- We'll find out!

01:47:52.117 --> 01:47:54.293
All I need is a miracle

01:47:54.642 --> 01:47:57.862
all I need is you

01:47:59.211 --> 01:48:01.475
all I need is a miracle

01:48:01.736 --> 01:48:04.478
all I need is you

01:48:06.349 --> 01:48:08.656
all I need is a miracle

01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:11.833
all I need is you

01:48:43.342 --> 01:48:44.779
I love this car.

01:48:44.822 --> 01:48:46.607
I love this song!

01:48:46.650 --> 01:48:49.174
I'm gonna love you
for the rest of your life

01:48:53.483 --> 01:48:54.528
let's go!

01:49:14.765 --> 01:49:16.201
Can I take your order?

01:49:17.376 --> 01:49:18.595
Three times chicken.

01:49:20.379 --> 01:49:22.619
Three times fries. Two colas
and an orange juice, please.

01:49:23.208 --> 01:49:24.427
And what name is it?

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.821
Spencer.

01:56:34.291 --> 01:56:36.990
