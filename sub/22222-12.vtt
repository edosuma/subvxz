WEBVTT

00:00.793 --> 00:02.374
Xhalax!

00:14.932 --> 00:17.139
Go on, do it.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.266
Believe me,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.935
nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.313
But I kill you,

00:24.400 --> 00:27.563
and another Retrieval Squad
will already be on its way.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.268
Unless...

00:29.363 --> 00:31.228
| report you terminated.

00:31.324 --> 00:34.987
In which case, you free me
here and now and you
disappear forever.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.033
You forget who's
in charge here.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.452
(grunts)

00:39.832 --> 00:41.572
I'll tell you what's
going to happen.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.578
You go back to High Command.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.536
You tell them I can deliver
Talyn and Moya.

00:46.631 --> 00:48.713
They can have the
escaped prisoners.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.632
They can even have
Crichton if they want.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.835
And in return?

00:54.347 --> 00:56.008
Two things.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.383
I want Aeryn.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.386
Oh Crais, you're so predictable.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.933
I want Aeryn!

01:01.020 --> 01:03.636
And I want to be a
Peacekeeper again.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.558
Is that what you think?

01:05.650 --> 01:07.265
Is that what you think
happened, Crichton?

01:07.360 --> 01:08.691
You were there?

01:08.778 --> 01:11.235
No, actually I was busy trying
to save Aeryn and Talyn

01:11.322 --> 01:13.404
while you were cutting deals
to save yourself.

01:13.491 --> 01:14.856
You know the truth.

01:14.951 --> 01:16.987
You know I'll never again
be a Peacekeeper.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.570
Never say never again, 007.
That's all I know.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.289
Still no news of Moya?

01:24.377 --> 01:27.585
Nothing resembling a Leviathan
for a million metras.

01:27.672 --> 01:31.506
Well surely the Peacekeepers
will send another Retrieval
Squad to come looking for her?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.583
Actually looking for Crais.

01:33.678 --> 01:37.296
So you really should do the
noble thing and jump ship
before you get us all killed.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.301
They're hunting Talyn as well.

01:39.392 --> 01:42.350
(eerie oscillating tone)

01:43.271 --> 01:45.387
l... l... I can't.

01:45.481 --> 01:47.062
You got a problem with
your head gear?

01:47.149 --> 01:50.277
Talyn's signals... confused.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.692
What the gletch is happening?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.394
Happening at full speed,
I can feel it.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.275
Talyn is fighting with himself.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.401
Crais, pull him back.

01:56.492 --> 01:57.902
I can't control him.

01:57.994 --> 02:01.703
Hey guys, we are flying
into a sun.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.332
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

02:14.427 --> 02:18.136
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

02:18.222 --> 02:19.803
I'm trying to stay alive...

02:19.890 --> 02:21.801
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

02:21.892 --> 02:24.599
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.143
If you can hear me...
Beware.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.186
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

02:28.274 --> 02:30.981
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

02:31.068 --> 02:35.562
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.988
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

02:38.075 --> 02:40.532
Not show them...
You exist...

02:40.619 --> 02:44.328
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

03:15.654 --> 03:19.021
Yazhnek shakrow aeilo...

03:19.116 --> 03:20.151
Knock it off, pop-top.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.107
Crais, get on the headset
and get us outta here.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.694
Talyn's doing everything he
can to fight against it.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.120
Against what?

03:26.207 --> 03:28.289
The sun's emitting unusual
pulses of radiation,

03:28.376 --> 03:32.164
attracting Talyn and compelling
him to fly directly
into the sun.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.245
So un-compel him. Stop him.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.750
Knock him out. Disconnect him.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.921
It's too late for that!

03:37.009 --> 03:38.124
Yazhnek...
-Shut up, Stark.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.299
Crais:
We re going in!

03:39.387 --> 03:40.502
Talyn!
-Talyn!

03:40.596 --> 03:42.632
(yelling)
-Talyn!

03:51.315 --> 03:52.896
What the frell?

03:58.489 --> 04:00.445
Talyn has pulled away.

04:00.533 --> 04:01.648
Saved us.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.199
And we're supposed to
be grateful?

04:04.286 --> 04:06.242
He's now orbiting the sun.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.743
The shields are holding, but
there are parts of Talyn I
can't see or feel.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.699
Crichton:
We re gonna have to do a
manual survey for damage.

04:11.794 --> 04:15.161
All right.
Crais, you should stay up
here in this section.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.622
The rest of us will divide up
the ship amongst us.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.298
Ohh! Oh.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.927
Crais, we're on Tier Two.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.629
Crichton:
I'd say that's a damaged area.

04:25.724 --> 04:30.093
The secondary control
node and it is...

04:31.063 --> 04:32.599
completely blown.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.148
You know, Talyn has got
a hog of a power plant

04:36.235 --> 04:38.647
but he's got a piss poor
electrical system.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.114
He sneezes and half of
his circuits fry.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.156
He hasn't fully healed from the
Retrieval Squad attack.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.029
Yeah, I know that.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.657
I still say he could use some
heavy-duty wiring.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.910
He's still young. He'll get
much stronger as he develops.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.913
Not if he flies into any
more stars he won't.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.620
How big is he going to get,
anyway? Is he going to be
Moya's size?

04:57.715 --> 04:59.671
Well, Crais seems to think so.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.419
Damn!
-Here.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.176
There. Be careful.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.759
Yeah.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.154
(echoing voice):
Are you there?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.906
Talyn, is that you?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.659
Are you there? Hello?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.160
Talyn?

05:42.218 --> 05:45.836
You know, for someone who
used to look down her
nose at tech work,

05:45.930 --> 05:47.420
you're pretty damn
good at this.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.176
Well, perhaps people
can change.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.348
Well, at least some people are
smiling around here these days.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.050
Yeah, I know.
It suits your face.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.180
l was talking about you.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.057
Me? I'm not smiling.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.729
Yes, you are.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.396
Pay attention to your work.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.363
Right.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.529
Focus on the work.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.156
And don't do that.

06:08.244 --> 06:10.656
I'm working here.
Stop distracting me.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.282
I'm distracting you?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.284
Yes, you are always
distracting me.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.081
Well then you are easily
distracted.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.203
No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.909
I'm not.
-Oh, really.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.459
Okay, that's a little
distracting.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.132
And it's something I did?

06:25.219 --> 06:26.334
Could be.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.419
What, something like...

06:31.308 --> 06:32.684
this?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.135
( chuckles )

06:36.230 --> 06:38.221
You said pay attention
to the work.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.145
You're right. I'm sorry.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.603
I won't distract you
any further.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.909
Crichton:
You have a problem?

06:57.001 --> 06:59.208
No, I don't have a problem.

06:59.295 --> 07:00.284
No?

07:00.379 --> 07:01.664
Uh-uh.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.672
You're not distracted?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.434
What are we doing?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.554
Better question, why now?

07:24.403 --> 07:25.438
What?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.360
What the hell is that?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.858
Crais, Talyn is leaking
some kinda...

07:32.953 --> 07:36.195
Oh, I see you've got it
in here too.

07:36.290 --> 07:41.034
As far as I can tell, the mist
is exuding from a dozen points
on three tiers.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.119
You know what it is?
-Drexim.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.455
A synaptic fluid naturally
occurring in Talyn's conduits.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.713
Uh-huh. Why is it steaming
from the walls?

07:49.803 --> 07:53.421
When it becomes acidic, it can
erode the seals joining
the conduits.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.348
That is a beautiful
design, Crais.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.721
Tell me, is this stuff
affecting you?

07:58.812 --> 08:02.521
No. But it seems to have made
Rygel permanently hungry.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.975
Has it been affecting
you or Aeryn?

08:06.070 --> 08:08.482
What exactly does it
do to Talyn?

08:08.572 --> 08:13.316
When he's in danger, it
increases the stimulus,
increasing his response rates.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.116
Right. 80 it's like adrenaline.

08:15.204 --> 08:19.948
Adrenaline in humans, when
we get in a tight spot,
makes us fight.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.908
And, uh...

08:22.002 --> 08:23.913
do other things.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.995
It's not gonna affect us
the same way, is it?

08:26.090 --> 08:28.752
Well, possibly. But the effects
should be manageable.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.252
Should... be manageable?

08:30.344 --> 08:33.177
Look, Crais, before ah,
we all go crackers...

08:33.263 --> 08:34.799
Hey baby, how ya doin'?

08:34.890 --> 08:37.381
...maybe we should get some
space suits, masks or something?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.137
I've already thought of that.
We're too late.

08:39.228 --> 08:42.561
The drexim has reached the
suits and it's made all
the seals dissolve.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.060
Then what are we gonna
do if it increases?

08:45.150 --> 08:48.608
We ignore it, and we do
what we have to do.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.436
Is that clear?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.396
Oh, aye, Captain.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.108
Yes, sir.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.738
(echoing voice):
Can you hear me?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.832
Talyn?

09:05.087 --> 09:07.294
Can you hear me?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.918
Are you there?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.390
I know how you're feeling,
Talyn.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.098
I saw you.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.222
I felt you wanted to die.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.446
What is this, Talyn?

09:38.537 --> 09:39.652
Please...

09:39.747 --> 09:42.033
( gasping ):
Who are you?!

09:42.124 --> 09:43.284
You can see me.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.161
I am Sierjna.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.244
This room, this room...
I haven't seen this
room before.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.045
But you can see me?
And hear me?

09:51.133 --> 09:52.964
Of course I can.
You're there in front of me.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.302
I am?

09:54.386 --> 09:57.799
Full formed? Visible? Vabaseena!

09:57.890 --> 09:59.175
You can help me!

09:59.266 --> 10:00.221
What... what do you want?

10:00.309 --> 10:01.765
This room, this room,
this room, this room...

10:01.852 --> 10:03.262
I seek the Pilot.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.344
I've never seen this
room before.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.851
I may say the same
about this ship.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.651
In part, it appears Leviathan,
and yet not.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.353
This ship is Talyn.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.986
It is a hybrid.
It is part Leviathan,
part gunship.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.658
Then where is the Pilot?
He should be here.

10:20.746 --> 10:24.113
There is no Pilot.
There has never been a Pilot.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.369
There is always a Pilot.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.046
But...

10:30.130 --> 10:33.088
never one who could see...

10:33.717 --> 10:35.253
heat”

10:37.221 --> 10:38.882
feel me.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.717
Until now.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.176
How did you get on board
this ship?

10:46.271 --> 10:50.014
l... | kanished.
You were in my zone.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.609
In your zone?
I don't understand.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.684
How did you get on board
this ship?

10:53.779 --> 10:56.145
Cycles ago, I came from
Dall-fer-yon.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.731
One microt I was on my ship,
and then not.

10:58.826 --> 11:02.159
I'm trapped, outside my world
for so long trying to get back.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.033
But I float here, unable to
free myself.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.205
I board a Leviathan, then
another, then another,

11:07.292 --> 11:10.955
only to find myself unseen,
unheard by all aboard.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.377
Until now.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.625
Where at last, I am given form.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.628
Finally I find those
who can help me.

11:17.719 --> 11:23.339
Please, only you can save me.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.767
As I suspected, Talyn is
overproducing drexim due to
the stress he's under.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.222
The radiation pulse is still
compelling him to move
towards the sun.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.647
He is resisting, barely.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.441
We're maintaining orbit and
we're not getting any closer.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.895
We're not getting any
further away either.

11:37.990 --> 11:41.107
How do we pry this boy loose?
Can we stick cotton
in his ears?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.863
Crais, is there a way to
filter out these pulses?

11:43.954 --> 11:47.697
His shields are linked to his
sensors to inform him of
ambient conditions.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.156
So, cut the link.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.331
That would blind him.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.626
Get him some sunglasses,
Blue Blockers.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.297
Perhaps we could recalibrate
his shields to block out that
one pulse spectrum.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.375
Well we might be able to if
the shield overrides
were functioning.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.675
Where's the fault?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.093
Secondary control node.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.557
(alarm blaring)
Talyn, intruder!

12:13.901 --> 12:15.857
I want to help you.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.935
They all say that.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.146
This unusual vessel.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.526
Is it a Leviathan?

12:22.618 --> 12:24.358
Who wants to know?

12:26.288 --> 12:29.280
I am Mu-Quillus.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.958
You are in great danger.

12:33.045 --> 12:38.381
If this is a Leviathan, you
must abandon ship immediately.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.298
Why?

12:40.385 --> 12:43.172
Your ship has been caught
by a Siren Star.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.221
Inevitably, it will succumb.

12:46.308 --> 12:50.768
Like the 83 Leviathans that
have already died here.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.600
So, this sun has claimed
over 80 Leviathans?

12:57.694 --> 13:02.688
Yes. Please get to your life
pods while you still can.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.742
I don't understand how this
vessel has lasted this long.

13:06.828 --> 13:11.618
Talyn is a hybrid Leviathan
built for combat, with much
tougher shielding.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.792
And weapons, I see.
Who built it?

13:15.879 --> 13:19.337
How 'bout you tell us first?
How did you get here?
You just beamed in?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.210
I transmuted.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.883
I'm something of a
hybrid myself.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.088
Able to switch between a matter
and an energy state.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.720
That's how I can exist in
the star's corona.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.057
So, you live here?

13:35.482 --> 13:40.351
I find the unusual spectrum of
the Siren Star quite pleasing.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.528
Crichton:
Or maybe you just like watching
Leviathans dive in and burn up.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.992
Perhaps you caused them
to do so.

13:46.076 --> 13:50.740
A Siren Star's pulse radiation
is a perfectly natural
phenomenon.

13:50.831 --> 13:55.541
It's not by fault that it
attracts Leviathans to it.

13:55.627 --> 13:59.745
I try to warn them, as
I'm warning you.

13:59.840 --> 14:05.585
But until now, they have always
perished before I could do so.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.839
I don't believe you.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.262
How severely damaged are you?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.466
How closely did you approach
before it pulled away?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.301
And I don't like all
these questions.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.806
Leave this ship.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.688
I'm only trying to help.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.606
Get off this ship now!

14:20.694 --> 14:22.104
Talyn!

14:24.156 --> 14:26.943
You'd be wise to listen to me.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.243
Damn, Crais, you re gettin
a bit trigger happy.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.288
I ordered him to leave.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.707
He wouldn't obey.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.330
So you killed him?

14:39.421 --> 14:40.376
What if he was trying to help?

14:40.464 --> 14:42.830
Cat lives in the corona
of a star, Crais.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.415
You think you're gonna take
him out with a couple
of pulse blasts?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.296
He's gone for the moment.
We've bought some time.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.675
Let's use it.
Get back to the conduits.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.302
Yes, Dad.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.266
Sierjna:
We must fly away, quickly

14:59.357 --> 15:00.733
Before he discovers I am here.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.852
Who?

15:01.943 --> 15:04.104
Mu-Quillus.
My saviour, my captor.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.356
A being like yourself?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.733
No, not like me,
another species.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.031
He inhabited this star
before I came.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.110
When my Leviathan perished,
he kept me from dying.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.696
He claims that he saw me
and had to save me.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.908
He says that he's in love with
me but I don't love him
and I never will.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.334
He murdered my ship and
all its passengers!

15:21.421 --> 15:22.126
He did that?!

15:22.214 --> 15:23.545
He's still doing it.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.170
That's why he's here, to lure
Leviathans to their doom.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.466
Why?

15:28.553 --> 15:31.169
He was contracted to,
by the Prahtikrah,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.880
a race of shipbuilders who see
Leviathans as competition.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.260
The more Leviathans disappear...

15:35.352 --> 15:36.467
The more ships they can sell.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.973
Yes!
-That's monstrous!

15:40.524 --> 15:41.934
Crais! Crais!

15:42.025 --> 15:44.562
Talyn is being lured
into the sun by...

15:44.653 --> 15:46.268
Crais:
By a creature named Mu-Quillus.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.569
I know that, Stark!

15:47.656 --> 15:50.022
What I need to know is
how to break free!

15:50.117 --> 15:52.654
I don't know. I don't know
how he's doing it.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.780
Sorry, I can't help you.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.449
We must break away.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.281
You don't know what
it's like to...

15:59.376 --> 16:01.537
to be trapped forever in
the light of the sun,

16:01.628 --> 16:06.042
not to be able to feel, to
touch, your only companion
a monster!

16:06.133 --> 16:07.418
Take me away from him.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.342
I want to walk on a planet
again. I want to breathe
its air.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.295
I want to drink its cool water.
Give me back my life!

16:13.390 --> 16:15.005
I can't.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.807
You've already passed
beyond life.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.768
Sierjna, you perished
with your shipmates.

16:23.859 --> 16:27.317
Mu-Quillus trapped your
soul between realms.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.147
I'm... dead?

16:33.702 --> 16:34.942
Oh, no!

16:35.036 --> 16:36.367
No, that's not true. I...

16:36.454 --> 16:39.366
You can see me.
You can touch me.

16:41.251 --> 16:46.621
Sierjna, I'm a Stykera with
certain talents.

16:46.715 --> 16:50.128
I can help you cross over
to the next level.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.420
To death?

16:54.514 --> 16:55.629
No!

16:55.724 --> 16:57.009
No. I'm alive.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.761
I'm here! I'm real again!

16:58.852 --> 17:02.390
You can never be real again
in the way you wish.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.223
I can only... release you.

17:06.318 --> 17:07.433
I don't believe it.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.644
You... this ship... you...
you brought me back.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.196
I'm whole again! lwon't
give that up!

17:18.747 --> 17:20.328
Come with me.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.366
God-like aliens.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.998
Man, do I hate god-like aliens.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.080
I'll trade a critter for a
god-like alien any day.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.338
No, no. We'll be
all right, as...

17:34.679 --> 17:36.260
as long as we stick together.

17:36.348 --> 17:40.717
Right, just not too...
close together, 'cause...

17:40.810 --> 17:43.347
Right, yeah, yes.
l-l know. I...

17:52.030 --> 17:54.817
We're gonna...
we're gonna... die...

17:54.908 --> 17:58.992
die, die, die, die, die, die,
die, if we don't get the
conduit fixed.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.410
Yeah, right!

18:00.497 --> 18:03.910
Focus. Eyes on the task.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.285
Remember the mist.

18:05.377 --> 18:08.335
The mist is not your friend.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.795
Right. Bad mist.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.131
Naughty mist.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.378
Aeryn:
Ooooh..

18:16.513 --> 18:18.970
(munching)

18:19.057 --> 18:20.217
(stomach gurgling)

18:20.308 --> 18:25.519
( groaning ):
Oh, that's, that's, that's...

18:25.605 --> 18:27.687
( belches and breaks wind )

18:27.774 --> 18:29.856
(relieved sigh )

18:29.943 --> 18:31.604
( falsetto voice ):
...better.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.687
But even for me, this
is a bit excessive.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.861
(chuckling)

18:35.949 --> 18:38.861
Rygel. Rygel, can we
talk to you?

18:38.952 --> 18:41.409
Stay back, unless you...

18:41.496 --> 18:42.952
I'm back. I'm back.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.325
( groaning ):
Ooh! What do you want?

18:45.417 --> 18:48.124
I... We just wanted to know...

18:48.211 --> 18:50.953
"We?" What are you
talking about?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.163
Have you gone totally fahrbot?

18:53.258 --> 18:55.670
Who's "we"?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.342
You see? It is as I said.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.045
lam the only one who
can see you.

19:00.140 --> 19:05.180
Stark, I'm too sick to witness
one of your hallucinations.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.101
Sierjna:
That can't be true! That...

19:07.188 --> 19:09.270
Sir, noble sir...

19:09.357 --> 19:12.099
Stark:
Sierjna, don't.
He can't hear you.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.979
He can't see you.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.607
Yes, well I can see you,
you crazy nik-nik!

19:16.698 --> 19:19.314
Who are you talking to?

19:19.409 --> 19:21.491
Only I can see you.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.411
Only I can hear you.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.203
Only me.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.788
I will take care of you.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.119
I promise.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.919
( Rygel sighs disgustedly)

19:34.007 --> 19:37.044
Right, that's done it.
He's gone.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.091
He's totally...
(grunting)

19:39.179 --> 19:41.215
( breaking wind )

19:41.306 --> 19:43.342
( falsetto ):
insane.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.515
( inhales and exhales)

19:46.478 --> 19:49.220
No, please, no.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.270
No, this can't be true!

19:51.358 --> 19:54.441
I told you. You are
zy-limbron, not alive.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.018
(rumbling)

19:59.991 --> 20:03.108
I've come to take you home.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.318
Sierjna:
No.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.323
lwon't go with you.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.950
Of course you will.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.997
You can't stay here.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.245
I can!

20:11.336 --> 20:12.826
I have found someone
who can help me!

20:12.921 --> 20:15.162
You know better than that.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.668
This ship is doomed.

20:17.759 --> 20:21.752
Like all the others, it will
be drawn into the sun,

20:21.846 --> 20:25.714
and all on board will perish.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.549
You will come back to me.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.226
Stark:
No! Not this time!

20:30.313 --> 20:31.814
I can free her.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.229
I am Stykera!

20:33.316 --> 20:35.898
l have the energy.

20:35.985 --> 20:41.070
Sierjna, please, come with me.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.567
No.

20:45.662 --> 20:49.200
No. I remain here, with Stark.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.579
If that is what you wish.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.293
( crackling )

21:04.848 --> 21:07.885
Crichton:
Mist, the mist, resist the mist.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.217
Resist the mist.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.435
Are you done?

21:13.523 --> 21:15.184
I'm almost done.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.856
I'm really close.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.353
Close?

21:18.445 --> 21:19.560
Nearly there.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.690
God, I love you.
-I love you, too.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.113
Tell me when you're done.
-I'm... nearly done.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.189
Tell me when you're finishing.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.241
I...
-Yeah?

21:27.829 --> 21:29.069
Yes?

21:29.164 --> 21:30.028
Almost!
-Yeah?

21:30.123 --> 21:30.953
Last one.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.325
Finished!

21:35.378 --> 21:37.084
(Talyn rumbling)

21:37.172 --> 21:38.457
Frell...
-Yeah.

21:38.548 --> 21:41.130
No, no, no. I mean, bad frell!

21:41.217 --> 21:43.594
Mr. Sun still wants Talyn.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.174
Crais! What's with the rumble?

21:47.265 --> 21:50.177
The radiation pulses have
intensified and changed.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.179
How the hell could that happen?
-I don't know, but they have

21:52.270 --> 21:54.682
and they're still changing.
-Shield overrides are working.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.683
I'll try and block out
the pulses.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.685
(rumbling)

21:59.360 --> 22:00.395
Sierjna:
Listen.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.773
I know that sound.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.980
He's luring your ship
back to the sun!

22:05.074 --> 22:06.029
No.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.573
You'll be killed, all of you!

22:07.660 --> 22:10.117
I've seen it before,
over and over.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.321
Sierjna...
-Every time!

22:12.415 --> 22:15.282
Mu-Quillus was right.
He's all I have.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.287
I'm going to be trapped
with him forever.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.960
Listen to me!
lwon't let that happen.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.754
l have a plan.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.751
A plan?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.503
Come on!

22:24.594 --> 22:27.631
I can't change Talyn's course.
His compulsion is stronger
than ever.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.179
The pulse spectrum is shifting
too quickly. I can't block
it out.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.177
The Pied Piper's found
a new tune.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.304
Explain.
-Natural phenomenon, my ass!

22:34.395 --> 22:37.262
Mu-Quillus is generating
these pulses.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.388
How?

22:39.484 --> 22:41.475
Crichton:
Uh... Orbiting boom box.

22:41.569 --> 22:44.231
He's, uh, whistling out
his butt. How the hell
should I know?!

22:44.322 --> 22:48.941
The point is, we gotta find
the source, and we-we
gotta squish it.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.363
I'm on scan.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.161
A plan, a plan.

22:54.249 --> 22:57.241
Save Talyn. A plan.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.792
Talyn, I will lead you
away from danger.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.255
What are you doing?

23:01.339 --> 23:04.251
This is a Pilot's station. Maybe
I can control Talyn from here.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.207
Guide him away from the sun.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.338
(gasping)

23:13.685 --> 23:15.596
Stark!
(whimpering)

23:17.313 --> 23:20.055
Hey, guys, I think maybe
I got something here.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.935
(rumbling)

23:22.026 --> 23:23.641
What the frell just happened?

23:24.779 --> 23:26.189
(grunting)

23:31.244 --> 23:33.326
Sierjna:
Stark!

23:33.413 --> 23:35.074
Who pulled the plug? Crais?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.495
Talyn?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.744
My transponder's dead, too.
I can't hear him.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.075
Crichton:
Aeryn, overrides?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.329
Gone. Everything's out.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.286
Crais:
Talyn, where are you?

23:44.507 --> 23:47.044
Nothing's responding.
Talyn is gone.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.675
Stark?

23:49.762 --> 23:52.299
No. Stark, can you hear me?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.550
( Stark groans )

23:59.647 --> 24:01.057
Talyn.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.891
Talyn, I am part of you now.

24:03.985 --> 24:08.695
Ah... I can sense all of you!

24:08.781 --> 24:10.487
I can guide you.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.692
Stark. Hurry! The sun!

24:13.786 --> 24:15.572
Yes, the sun.

24:15.663 --> 24:19.121
Talyn, you will turn away.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.200
You must turn away.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.751
(rumbling)

24:27.717 --> 24:29.253
Talyn is turning.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.424
But how?

24:31.387 --> 24:34.003
Everyone, we're saved!

24:34.098 --> 24:35.304
We've done it!

24:35.391 --> 24:36.722
Who has done what?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.425
Talyn and l.
We've escaped from the sun.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.683
And we saved Sierjna
from Mu-Quillus.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.431
Sierjna?

24:44.525 --> 24:46.732
Sie... Sierjna...

24:48.529 --> 24:51.487
Oh, no! We must've
gone too far.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.690
She-she couldn't stay with us.

24:53.785 --> 24:57.448
Crichton:
Stark! What in the living hell
are you talking about?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.574
We must go back.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.452
Must find her.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.212
Aeryn:
He's turning again.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.632
Stark, are you controlling
Talyn?

25:11.719 --> 25:14.552
Yes, yes. I must.
I must, I must, I must...

25:18.017 --> 25:19.427
Crichton:
Yo, Astro!

25:19.519 --> 25:24.934
Calm down and tell me.
What the hell is going on?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.391
It's very, very simple.

25:28.486 --> 25:34.197
I am now Talyn's Pilot, and we
are flying back into the sun.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.863
What do you mean, you're
Talyn's Pilot?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.694
Talyn doesn't have a Pilot.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.404
Stark:
He does now.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.332
I've bonded with him, formed a
neural link, joined with
him in the Den.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.035
What Den?
-Can't speak now.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.165
Searching for Sierjna.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.247
Must find Sierjna.

25:50.341 --> 25:53.879
Stark? Stark, you release
control of Talyn at once.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.757
Good old Stark. Count on him
to jump right in and
wig right out.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.554
How could he have bonded
with Talyn?

25:58.641 --> 26:01.257
Talyn must've developed a
rudimentary Pilot's Den.

26:01.352 --> 26:05.937
Crais, I thought you bred out
the need for a Pilot in Talyn.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.106
We tried to, but Leviathan
biology is complex.

26:09.193 --> 26:13.402
Enough linked genes must've
remained for Talyn to grow a
vestigial Pilot facility.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.195
Like an appendix?

26:15.283 --> 26:17.490
Wait. Where is this Den?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.408
Most likely somewhere
below Tier Three.

26:19.495 --> 26:23.158
If I can't restore the
overrides, I'll go
find it myself.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.082
Fine, you do that, get his
hands off the wheel.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.160
We're gonna do something else.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.705
Sierjna...

26:35.553 --> 26:37.168
Which one is guidance?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.844
That one.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.258
No. No, no.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.762
Crichton:
Hey Stark, did you feel that?

26:44.854 --> 26:47.391
No. No, I can't...
I can't maneuver.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.598
Crichton:
That's right. You might want
to hit the brakes.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.353
We just took out your steering.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.651
( screaming )

26:53.738 --> 26:56.400
Talyn, you listen to me!

26:56.491 --> 26:58.197
I know you can hear me.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.320
You're taking the wrong option.

27:00.411 --> 27:03.369
You will kill us and you
will kill yourself.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.243
Come on, Stark. Talk to me.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.542
We can work this out.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.336
Yo, Astro.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.757
Talk to me.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.893
We can work it out.

27:29.065 --> 27:32.353
Lava Boy is not your
friend. I am.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.320
You okay?

27:38.407 --> 27:40.739
Yeah. Yeah, I'm...
I'm alright.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.237
Thanks for watching
my backside.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.364
Couldn't help myself.
Stark, you listen to me now.

27:44.455 --> 27:48.164
You try anything like that
again and I will personally
take you to the other side.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.207
(groans in frustration )

28:02.682 --> 28:05.515
(muffled whine)

28:05.601 --> 28:08.263
Talyn, I am trying to help you.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.890
All the lower decks
are sealed off.

28:09.981 --> 28:13.223
I can't get into the Den to
free you from the Banik slave.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.649
That's it, Talyn.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.728
Bypass the primary
guidance system.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.359
Yes, that's it. Careful!

28:20.449 --> 28:23.236
We don't want them finding
out what we're doing.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.942
Talyn, you listen to me!

28:25.037 --> 28:27.153
I am trying to save you.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.283
Talyn!

28:29.417 --> 28:30.156
( beeping )

28:30.251 --> 28:35.371
Crichton:
Hey, Stark. Talk to me.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.501
You getting lonely up there?
You like being alone?

28:39.969 --> 28:41.379
Don't think he's listening.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.721
No.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.215
But it's not good to be alone?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.547
No, it's not.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.676
Maybe we should go find him.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.303
And leave these conduits
unaﬂended?

28:48.394 --> 28:51.136
He'll send up another DRD
to repair it all.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.347
Yeah, and lead us like
a moth to the flame.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.398
Let Stark make the first move.
You know what's he's like.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.100
He doesn't have much patience.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.776
Right.

29:01.324 --> 29:06.660
We have, uh, all the time in
the world. No need to rush.

29:24.472 --> 29:25.837
You comfortable?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.342
Mm-hmm.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.808
Aeryn, this is the
mist talking.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.852
I like what it's saying.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.099
So do I, but we gotta...
we gotta focus.

29:38.194 --> 29:42.233
I'm doing my job.
Corridor is all clear.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.234
So it's just you and me.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.450
Just you and me.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.200
Stark:
Slower, slower Talyn.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.455
That's it.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.255
Mustn't let you get too close,
just close enough.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.340
Sierjna:
Stark?

30:03.427 --> 30:06.169
( gleeful scream )
-Stark!

30:06.263 --> 30:07.719
Sierjna!

30:07.807 --> 30:09.968
But you got away.
You were free.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.390
I came back for you.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.344
No. No, you're risking
everything.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.974
Nothing else matters.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.478
I told you I would save you
and Iwill, even if it
takes my own life.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.183
Stark...
-I will take you,

30:21.278 --> 30:24.270
I will walk you to
the other side.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.196
Do you trust me?

30:26.283 --> 30:27.568
Mu-Quillus will kill you.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.776
Do you trust me?!

30:33.165 --> 30:34.575
Yes.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.955
Are you ready?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.296
I'm frightened.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.715
Don't be frightened. No need.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.298
Come closer.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.235
I'm ready.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.032
Thank you.

31:11.829 --> 31:15.287
Nah vahajma, nah vaheerma...

31:15.374 --> 31:18.161
I will find you in
the next life.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.798
You're still here.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.726
I have neither moved
norchanged.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.518
It's not working.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.813
Why is it not working?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.229
(Rygel groaning)

31:46.572 --> 31:48.312
Are you still eating?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.614
Oh, stop me, Crais.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.111
Make me stop.

31:52.203 --> 31:55.616
Shoot me! Do something, please!

31:55.706 --> 31:59.324
Here, here, tie my hands. Yes!
-I need your help.

31:59.418 --> 32:03.161
No, no, no, no, no.
Tie my hands now, or
I'm going to explode.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.292
(stomach rumbles loudly)
Ah, this is all your fault!

32:06.383 --> 32:08.044
This is your gunship.

32:08.135 --> 32:11.218
Peacekeepers designed it
and you can't control it.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.466
But I can control you now.

32:13.557 --> 32:17.391
( gasping ):
You press that into me and I'm
going to vomit all over you.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.261
Stark is a mutineer.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.142
He's also out of his
frelling mind.

32:22.233 --> 32:25.100
Came in here, had a
conversation with that wall.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.025
Must be the mist making
him see things.

32:27.113 --> 32:30.196
Rygel, Stark has taken
control of Talyn.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.898
He must be flushed out so I
can take back command.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.733
Well, go ahead.

32:35.496 --> 32:38.078
I need your help, slug.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.905
Please let me eat that
little piece, please.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.458
Now you listen to me.
Talyn has sealed all the
entrances to his Den,

32:43.546 --> 32:47.289
but maybe you, being so small,
can slip through a
ventilation duct.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.169
(laughing):
Look at me.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.752
Look at my stomachs. I'm not
slipping through any ducts.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.337
lam your captain.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.466
You're not my captain.

32:55.558 --> 32:58.095
This is a direct order.
-Dream on!

32:58.185 --> 33:01.143
If you don't obey my orders...
-Yes, this mist isn't
affecting you, huh?

33:01.230 --> 33:02.595
If you do not obey my
orders right now

33:02.690 --> 33:04.897
and go into the Pilot's Den
and flush out the Banik,

33:04.984 --> 33:06.940
I will shoot you as a mutineer.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.733
(gasping)

33:09.989 --> 33:12.150
As you wish.

33:16.287 --> 33:18.243
Crais, come here.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.285
Why?

33:19.373 --> 33:20.704
Closer.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.247
It's a secret.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.416
If you try anything...

33:25.296 --> 33:26.411
Closer.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.665
(loud crunching)

33:27.756 --> 33:29.007
( screaming )

33:29.091 --> 33:31.252
(Rygel laughing)

33:32.887 --> 33:35.219
Rygel!

33:35.306 --> 33:38.469
I don't understand it. You...
It... It should've worked.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.925
(loud rumbling)

33:46.483 --> 33:48.064
Let her go.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.312
If we try again...

33:49.403 --> 33:52.361
Nothing will happen.

33:52.448 --> 33:56.862
Why do you think she never
crossed over in the first place?

33:56.952 --> 34:01.321
What do you think is keeping
her between the realms?

34:01.415 --> 34:04.407
Me. My power.

34:05.252 --> 34:08.335
You had your chance to escape.

34:08.422 --> 34:14.133
You might have saved your ship,
your crew, your own life.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.552
But you returned.

34:17.765 --> 34:19.801
You have me back Mu-Quillus.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.223
You can let them go.

34:21.310 --> 34:25.144
No. It is not for me to
make that decision.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.604
My task is set.

34:27.691 --> 34:31.934
The ship will continue
to the sun.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.315
Sierjna.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.658
Come with me.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.280
Stark:
No, no!

34:40.371 --> 34:42.578
Sierjna...

34:42.665 --> 34:44.326
Stark:
Don't do it!

34:44.416 --> 34:46.452
No, you must.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.171
Wait, Sierjna!

34:53.259 --> 34:54.965
Don't go!

34:57.846 --> 35:00.303
(rumbling)

35:00.391 --> 35:03.758
Oh, no. No, no, no,
Talyn, please!

35:03.852 --> 35:06.935
Fight it! Fight it! Turn away!

35:07.022 --> 35:10.310
Turn away, please, Talyn! No!

35:10.401 --> 35:13.063
Talyn, please turn away!

35:13.153 --> 35:14.768
Stark!

35:16.532 --> 35:18.568
Everyone...

35:19.743 --> 35:21.950
I'm sorry.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.746
Talyn is once more being
drawn into the sun.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.165
The lure is stronger than ever,

35:29.253 --> 35:33.713
and Talyn can't fight it
and I can't stop him.

35:33.799 --> 35:39.294
So, I suggest you prepare
yourselves for peace.

35:41.432 --> 35:46.392
Because I have failed you,
and we're all going to die.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.931
All we can do now is wait.

35:52.526 --> 35:53.686
I'm not letting you go.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.314
I'm never letting you go.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.074
Wait a microt.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.322
What?

36:06.165 --> 36:07.996
This is wrong.

36:09.793 --> 36:13.206
God, the mist... the damn mist
is messing with our heads.

36:13.297 --> 36:14.833
That's why we're giving up.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.254
I'm not giving up.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.457
I never give up.

36:17.551 --> 36:20.133
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bridge.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.131
I'm gonna to tear it apart.
I'm gonna to find something.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.429
Okay. The same with
Crais and Stark.

36:25.559 --> 36:26.969
You tear 'em apart, baby.

36:27.061 --> 36:29.723
All right, listen. I don't want
to lose you either.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.145
Can we definitely get
back to that later?

36:32.232 --> 36:33.847
Oh, God, I love you.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.443
I love you, too.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.610
(Crais grunting )
Crais, what are you...

36:42.701 --> 36:44.737
I can't get in!

36:44.828 --> 36:46.864
Talyn will not comply
with my orders!

36:46.955 --> 36:50.413
And the drexim it's obviously
driven him insane.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.162
Blast your way in.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.244
Yes. Give me your gun.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.955
Perhaps not.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.961
Do not question my decisions!

37:00.052 --> 37:01.917
lam your captain!

37:02.012 --> 37:03.798
And | order you!

37:06.308 --> 37:08.515
lam your captain!

37:10.896 --> 37:12.761
I order you!

37:16.026 --> 37:18.267
All right, Phantom, new tune
for the opera.

37:18.362 --> 37:20.227
Stark ( muttering ):
Sierjna's gone.
I've failed her.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.985
Failed her. Failed Aeryn.
Failed you, Crichton.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.533
Yes, and you have failed
gloriously, Stark.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.781
And I want you to fail again.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.739
I want you to give me control
of the consoles.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.620
I want you to give me
some control.

37:33.710 --> 37:37.703
She came to me for help.
Not many do, but... I could
have done more.

37:37.798 --> 37:41.461
Stark, I am coming to
you for help.

37:41.552 --> 37:43.634
You are gonna give me control

37:43.720 --> 37:47.212
or I am gonna rip off the
other side of your damn face!

37:47.307 --> 37:49.298
There's nothing you
can do, Crichton.

37:49.393 --> 37:52.135
We're going to be lured into
that sun and we're all going
to die inside there.

37:52.229 --> 37:56.939
That's because the bastard is
luring us in, Stark. okay?

37:57.025 --> 37:59.277
He's got bait and
we can cut bait.

37:59.361 --> 38:00.942
We've got a mother of a cannon.

38:02.990 --> 38:07.404
l was zeroing in on the damn
power source when you turned
out the lights.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.743
You remember when we met?

38:10.831 --> 38:14.244
You want to take a trip
down memory lane?

38:14.334 --> 38:18.202
Stark! My side, your side,
my side, your side,
my side, your side.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.208
I tried to help you then,
but I failed.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.665
Scorpius put a chip in your
brain. I failed.

38:22.759 --> 38:26.126
Stark, blow the damn
Aurora Chair.

38:26.221 --> 38:29.839
Let's talk about the
good times, huh?

38:29.933 --> 38:32.015
Do you remember Zhaan, Stark?

38:32.102 --> 38:34.218
Let's talk about Zhaan.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.349
I tried to help her,
but I couldn't.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.977
Well she would piss on
your grave right now.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.898
You wanna know why?

38:41.236 --> 38:42.316
My soulmate.

38:42.404 --> 38:45.316
Because Aeryn is my Zhaan.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.193
She's my Zhaan in every way.

38:47.284 --> 38:50.902
I love her, and I would die for
her. And you know what, Stark?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.406
You're killing her.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.034
What? Me?

38:54.124 --> 38:57.332
You're killing her you
freakazoid, psycho bastard.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.580
You are killing my Zhaan!

39:04.384 --> 39:06.875
Yeah. Aha.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.597
I got some control back.
Let me show ya.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.683
I love it when you
take control.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.268
This is drexim talking.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.694
No, it isn't.

39:25.781 --> 39:27.317
I can manually prime
the cannon.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.533
I'd love to see that.

39:28.617 --> 39:29.572
Talyn's cannon.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.868
I'm stoked, not stupid. Do it.

39:32.955 --> 39:34.445
We've only got one chance
with it, John.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.202
We're too close to the star.
We've got one chance.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Check this out.

39:40.462 --> 39:44.956
A throbbing pulse of energy
coming straight into your
living room. I got it.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.631
Stark, are you still there?

39:46.718 --> 39:49.881
You're just like Zhaan
in so many ways.

39:49.972 --> 39:51.337
If you say so.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.968
lam going to manually prime
the main cannon.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.299
Crichton has located a target.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.305
Please prepare Talyn to fire.

39:57.396 --> 40:00.980
Would Zhaan approve of
this use of violence?

40:01.066 --> 40:03.978
She's speaking through me now.
It is her wish.

40:11.994 --> 40:15.327
No. You're risking everything.
-You're back.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.200
You're too close.
Don't do this for me.

40:17.291 --> 40:20.283
I'm not. Mu-Quillus has
Talyn mesmerized.

40:23.839 --> 40:26.751
Stop what you're doing.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.835
Is there some kind of
stupid alien quotation book
you guys use?

40:30.929 --> 40:34.171
A deal between us
can be brokered.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.882
Lava Boy, you are losing.

40:36.977 --> 40:40.219
A compromise assures
your survival.

40:40.314 --> 40:41.895
Again with the quote book.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.472
Hey, quote me on this.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.730
We're gonna blow up
your fuse box.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.562
I'll release my grip
on your vessel.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.151
And in return?

40:53.035 --> 40:54.991
Go away.

40:57.247 --> 41:01.160
He's gonna give us our freedom
in exchange for his.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.001
Leave us to our own.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.795
What about other Leviathans
you'll encounter?

41:08.592 --> 41:12.050
Why should that concern you?

41:14.348 --> 41:16.430
That was the wrong answer.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.642
Sorry.

41:17.726 --> 41:18.761
Stark?

41:18.852 --> 41:21.389
Talyn. It is time.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.436
Power down your weapons.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.855
I can offer you better terms.

41:25.942 --> 41:29.025
Crichton:
Damn, Smoky! You can't
argue with a woman.

41:34.242 --> 41:37.279
(Mu-Quillus screaming)

41:39.373 --> 41:43.241
Sierjna!

41:58.308 --> 42:00.264
Now...

42:00.352 --> 42:04.686
Nah vahajma, nah vaheerma,
beker del rais.

42:30.549 --> 42:34.792
Crais:
This apparatus was not designed
for any species but a Pilot's.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.218
What you did was beyond
foolish, Stark.

42:37.305 --> 42:38.920
Hold still.

42:40.726 --> 42:41.932
You cut me.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.474
You moved.

42:49.151 --> 42:50.561
(grunts)

42:50.652 --> 42:53.189
Talyn is now off-limits to you.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.647
All functions, all programs,
all controls.

42:57.367 --> 42:58.698
I know.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.195
You know nothing.

43:00.287 --> 43:05.452
I know how he feels, what he
thinks, about everything.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.870
About you.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.206
Talyn was not of his
right mind.

43:11.298 --> 43:17.794
Anything you think you
experienced must take that
into consideration.

43:17.888 --> 43:19.378
I know.

43:21.933 --> 43:26.347
Even if you slit my throat,
I will still know.

43:34.029 --> 43:36.987
Most of Talyn's internal
systems are back on-Iine,

43:37.073 --> 43:41.157
and his drexim levels have
returned to normal.

43:41.244 --> 43:44.281
( groaning )
I wish my levels were
returning to normal.

43:44.372 --> 43:47.455
Next Commerce Planet you are
restocking the galley.
You ate everything.

43:47.542 --> 43:52.206
I never, ever want to even
look at food again.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.208
(groaning)

43:55.383 --> 43:56.634
Must go to chamber.

43:56.718 --> 43:58.083
Need sleep.

43:58.178 --> 43:59.463
Vomit.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.840
Out of my way!

44:03.433 --> 44:04.513
How's it going?

44:04.601 --> 44:07.308
He's recovering well.
He's a remarkable vessel.

44:08.230 --> 44:10.061
Speaking of...

44:10.649 --> 44:12.355
remarkable vessels.

44:12.442 --> 44:15.104
How is the secondary
control node?

44:15.195 --> 44:17.186
I got a chain gang of DRDs
working on it.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.441
Everything will be up and
running in a couple of days.

44:19.533 --> 44:21.899
We were very lucky.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.075
Well, I think that, uh...

44:25.413 --> 44:29.156
Fates would have brought
us together anyway.

44:29.251 --> 44:36.248
You know, Crais is going to
be cutting Stark free
for about an arn.

44:36.341 --> 44:40.129
Rygel's going to take at least
that long. He's got
three stomachs.
