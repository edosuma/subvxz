00:07.382 --> 00:09.426
[narrator] Recorded earlier
in Manhattan, New York,

00:09.509 --> 00:11.886
it's the Culinary Debate Society.

00:12.512 --> 00:16.850
Tonight, we pose the question,
Italian stuffed pastas or Asian dumplings?

00:17.475 --> 00:22.147
Representing the sides will be
chefs Mario Carbone and David Chang.

00:23.064 --> 00:27.569
Hello, I'm Nick Kroll. And for no apparent
reason, I am involved in this debate.

00:27.652 --> 00:30.905
I'm about to talk to Mario Carbone
about stuffed pastas.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.326
[Carbone] I'm Italian.
I know Italian food.

00:35.410 --> 00:40.457
I'm making Italian food more Italian than
any other restaurant in the United States.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.294
Dave has a tremendous amount of animosity
towards us. Us, the Italian community.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.088
He's very angry.
I believe it's rooted in jealousy.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.174
Mario, before you head into this debate,

00:49.257 --> 00:52.635
any words you'd like to tell the public
out there about what's about to happen?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.387
Dave's my archnemesis.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.807
And I'm looking forward to
really beating the shit out of him.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.018
[Chang] Of all the cultures in America

01:00.101 --> 01:02.812
that I feel is under-represented
in its importance,

01:02.896 --> 01:04.438
is probably Asian culture.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.233
So that's something that
I'm obviously more passionate about.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.571
Mario... We used to cook together
at Cafe Boulud in 2003.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.115
And we've been enemies ever since.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.367
If there's anything
you'd like to say to the camera,

01:16.451 --> 01:20.371
to Mario, or to the people at home
watching on their computer,

01:20.455 --> 01:24.501
or some weird other device on Netflix,
uh, what do you have to say to them?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.336
Konnichiwa, bitches.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.339

[Meehan]
And now, we begin our debate.

02:15.593 --> 02:19.180
The first question is, who did it first?
Who invented the dumpling?

02:19.264 --> 02:22.433
Listen, I'm not gonna fight
the "who did it first" argument.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.601
We all know.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.645
-China did it first.
-[audience laughing]

02:25.728 --> 02:27.355
I'm not here to debate that.
I'm not.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.024
I don't think that the question
that really matters right now is,

02:30.108 --> 02:32.235
"Who did it first?"
It's, "Who does it best?"

02:32.318 --> 02:34.529
Great question.
You know what I stumbled on today?

02:34.612 --> 02:37.115
-Nishi's Valentine's Day prix fixe menu.
-Ooh.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.411
Nishi, for the judge's reference,
is David Chang's restaurant in Chelsea.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.580
Do you know what you're serving
at the restaurant for Valentine's Day?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.789
It's not Italian.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.334
Okay. "Shrimp scampi.
Spaghetti and meatballs."

02:48.418 --> 02:52.714
So all of those dishes are made
with zero Italian ingredients.

02:52.797 --> 02:57.552
We're serving food that looks Italian,
but made with Asian ingredients.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.220
What is spaghetti and meatballs?

02:59.304 --> 03:02.432
-That's not Italian. I could make--
-Where did that idea come from?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.392
I could do lo mein
and lion's head meatballs.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.895
You're using the popularity
of my people's cuisine

03:06.978 --> 03:08.813
to get people in your door.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.481
-[audience exclaiming]
-Ooh! [chuckles]

03:14.319 --> 03:19.490
[Chang] In New York, Mario wants to
elevate Italian-American food.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.409
It's hard not to get excited about that.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.331
Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi
just reopened up the Four Seasons.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.084
It is amazing.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.131
[Meehan] So, what do you got here?
What'd you bring?

03:35.215 --> 03:38.843
We brought the king of the stuffed pasta,
the tortellini.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.847
-[Meehan] Squid ink mezzaluna?
-[Carbone] Sì, signore.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.267
So, I grew up eating stuffed pasta.
That's a big Italian-American thing.

03:46.351 --> 03:50.188
And the first sort of obviously grand
master I worked for was Mario Batali.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.607
Then he sent me to Italy
and I didn't even commit a crime.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.068
He just sent me there
for educational purposes.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.694
I lived in Italy for, like,
a year and a half.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.949
We made everything from scratch,
as you would normally find there.

04:01.032 --> 04:05.286
It's really important to have those, like,
North Star bites of food

04:05.370 --> 04:08.915
that are like, "Okay, that's where...
That's where I need to go."

04:08.998 --> 04:12.961
So, the squid ink provides that sort of
bottom-of-the-ocean flavor.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.170
[Meehan] Right, base note.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.714
[Carbone] And then you get the top
of the ocean with the clean lobster.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.426
[Meehan] All married
in a big sea of cream.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.137
"Sea of cream."
God, you make it sound so hot.

04:23.221 --> 04:28.518
[chuckles] How many different varieties
of stuffed pastas do you guys do?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.062
Very few. There are not that many.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.732
'Cause everywhere
below, basically, Tuscany,

04:34.816 --> 04:38.027
or northern Tuscany,
there really isn't stuffed pasta.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.153
There's nearly none.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.363
-Sicily...
-No.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.324
Basically, it comes down to having room
for the animals.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.369
So, there's only room for animals, really,
in the northern part of Italy.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.289
So, the ingredients,
the by-products of those animals,

04:49.372 --> 04:52.792
and the dishes that came from that,
make up those regional dishes.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.920
[Meehan] What makes these Carbone pastas?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.298
What makes it more Queens
and less Bologna?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.551
Instead of just ground pork,
it's ground sausage meat.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.096
It's done in the traditional manner,
it's finished with dairy.

05:05.179 --> 05:09.600
But it's that sweet sausage turn to it
that reminds me of the sauce

05:09.684 --> 05:12.645
that has, like, the sausage and meatballs
cooking all day in it.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.857
When we finish this dish,

05:15.940 --> 05:18.860
the bite of food
is very much reminiscent

05:18.943 --> 05:20.862
of, like,
a Sunday Italian-American supper.

05:20.945 --> 05:25.074
There's a little bit of your narrative
of how you learned to cook in the dish.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.784
[Carbone] Yeah. This is like me
learning to cook in Italy

05:26.868 --> 05:28.494
and me growing up in Queens.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.330
[Meehan] Yeah. Should we eat some?

05:30.413 --> 05:33.583
-[Carbone] Yeah. As my guest, be my guest.
-[Meehan] Really?

05:36.961 --> 05:38.421
You barely feel the pasta.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.340
It's as thin as it can be,
while still thick enough to hold it.

05:41.424 --> 05:45.178
Right. It's just having a tiny little bit
of texture to contribute in pasta form.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.638
[Carbone] There's so much protein
in this one

05:47.722 --> 05:50.308
that it is really similar to,
almost, a shumai.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.685
A really dark and rich flavor.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.646
You know, it's like Dave Chang.
Not for everyone.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.856
[laughs]

05:56.939 --> 05:58.191
Dave's going to Italy.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.235
He's gonna go spend time
with your friend, Massimo Bottura.

06:01.319 --> 06:06.741
It's so unfortunate that I'm not gonna
be able to make it to Italy for this trip.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.910
Some chefs have to cook.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.661
[laughing]

06:16.084 --> 06:18.336
[Chang] Massimo's basically one of
the biggest chefs in the world.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.798
Three-Michelin star chef.
Number one restaurant in the world.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.174
[in Italian] Smell this.

06:23.257 --> 06:27.095
[in English] The food he does, I think,
is not just representative of Italy,

06:27.178 --> 06:30.431
but it's also telling stories of Italian
food that haven't been told before.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.435
This is like ground zero
for stuffed pasta.

06:38.231 --> 06:43.569
[Bottura] When you are making tortellini,
the pasta, you roll it and you cut.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.324
You see?

06:48.407 --> 06:51.577
It's just perfect.
And when you are making tortellini,

06:51.661 --> 06:55.873
this is a normal size and you put the fill

06:55.957 --> 06:59.752
that is the reflection of the best product
of the area.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.629
Everything you have, you put inside.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.547
-Right. Right.
-You know?

07:02.630 --> 07:08.302
So ham, a little bit of mortadella,
parmigiano reggiano, pork and veal.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.638
The most important thing
is parmigiano reggiano.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.808
This cheese is sold out
before even produced,

07:13.891 --> 07:18.438
because the request is so high.
Because of the quality.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.816
-[chuckles] That's so good. Fuck.
-It's unbelievable. Fucking good, eh?

07:21.899 --> 07:26.404
[Chang] Parmigiano reggiano is, I think,
more beloved as a source of umami

07:26.487 --> 07:29.949
because it's a little sweet,
a little sour. Right?

07:30.032 --> 07:31.451
-Exactly. And the acidity.
-A little salty.

07:31.534 --> 07:37.039
And when you eat Asian varieties of umami,
it's mostly like salty and fermented.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.040
-Yes.
-Right?

07:38.124 --> 07:42.712
Just think, for the Western world, that
Parmesan is so easy to understand.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.630
It's very easy to understand.

07:44.714 --> 07:49.093
These flavors are distilled from
centuries and centuries of tradition.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.472
And now, you can imagine
how incredible the flavor is.

07:53.055 --> 07:56.350
And you make tortellini dal dito mignolo,
from the little finger.

07:57.018 --> 08:01.731
You turn like this, you know,
to have a little triangle.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.109
Then you move like this.
And around the finger.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.321
[Chang] This is wontons.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.282
This is a mini Chinese dumpling.
It's not a tortellini. [chuckling]

08:11.365 --> 08:14.785
Come on. "It's a mini Chinese dumpling."

08:14.869 --> 08:16.913
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.122
That's what I--

08:18.206 --> 08:21.751
But you know that my old master
was a Chinese man, yeah?

08:21.834 --> 08:22.668
Yeah.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.630
-I went there in that village...
-[laughing]

08:25.713 --> 08:28.716
Okay, no, no, it's not true.
Don't follow us.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.510
Don't follow us. Okay?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.428
-No, don't say that. Okay.
-Don't say that.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.933
You can see a dumpling
in so many different cultures.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.020
If you think about Asia,
you have the momo in Tibet,

08:42.104 --> 08:45.149
samosas in Indian food is a dumpling.

08:46.651 --> 08:51.030
What I've been looking for
is a commonality on the creative end.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.074
Some kind of universal emotions.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.957
I consider this a dumpling. Am I crazy?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.793
Uh... Is a calzone a dumpling?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.127
Whose side are you on, man?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.255
[laughs] I don't know, man.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.386
Do you think that most of dim sum
can be categorized as dumpling, then?

09:13.469 --> 09:15.346
-Depends what you wrap inside.
-Huh.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.849
[Boon] These two are
the must dishes of dim sum.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.185
Prawn dumplings, pork dumplings.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.939
This is one of the best things
you could ever eat.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.524
I personally like a lot of pasta.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.150
Damn it.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.119
This was a recent creation.
I remember seeing photos

09:38.202 --> 09:41.622
of people eating huge soup dumplings.
This is a smaller version.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.544
We're in this food museum.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.587
[both] Konnichiwa!

09:48.170 --> 09:49.630
I haven't seen any of this shit before.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.757
It looks more Chinese.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.051
It looks like the Tim Allen of Japan.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.679
[speaking Japanese]

09:56.762 --> 09:58.472
Yes, cheese dumplings, please.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.141
[in English]
This is like Blade Runner food.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.893
[chuckling] I swear to God.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.063
Given time, food cultures
will merge into one thing.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.319
One chef that I know
that's elevated dumplings

10:11.402 --> 10:16.240
to one of the highest forms is Corey Lee,
at his three-Michelin star, Benu.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.580
And one of his signature dishes
is a foie gras soup dumpling.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.497
A xiao long bao.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.544
[Corey Lee] The thing about
xiao long bao is,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.504
I think the dough is different
than other dumplings.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.883
You need some elasticity,
but you also need some strength.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.386
So, that's what makes xiao long bao,
I think, a very tricky thing to make.

10:39.055 --> 10:43.976
The key in our xiao long bao-making
process is that it's very exact.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.481
Basically what happens is, you make
a stock with things to gelatinize,

10:48.564 --> 10:50.358
and that's set when it's cold.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.903
And then, when it gets hot,
the gelatinized soup melts

10:53.986 --> 10:56.322
and it becomes this hot soup
that washes over you.

10:58.574 --> 11:03.371
What you actually do when you make it,
is you pleat in three sections.

11:03.454 --> 11:07.041
You know, I don't really count.
When I started, I started with 21.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.626
Lot of people say it's 18.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.419
But I think when you originally start,

11:10.503 --> 11:13.130
it helps to have
a number that's divisible by three.

11:13.714 --> 11:17.176
So, whether it's 18 or 21,
I think it's divisible by three.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.393
So, this is kind of the key thing,
where you have this farce drooping.

11:25.476 --> 11:29.605
And that just shows you how much
soup and filling there is in there.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.737
I kind of have a theory about the way
the xiao long bao evolved.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.241
If you go to Shanghai,
where xiao long bao was invented,

11:40.324 --> 11:41.867
they use very thick dough.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.538
They're tasty, but it's nothing like
the very thin-skinned xiao long bao

11:45.621 --> 11:48.791
that I think a lot of people
have a reference point for.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.627
That style of xiao long bao
happened in Taiwan.

11:51.710 --> 11:55.297
And, of course, Din Tai Fung,
which is an incredible franchise

11:55.381 --> 11:58.050
that's really synonymous
with xiao long bao these days,

11:58.134 --> 12:01.387
that family was originally from Shanghai.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.140
I think because that family
wasn't necessarily trained,

12:04.223 --> 12:07.560
they just decided to make
xiao long bao with thinner dough.

12:07.643 --> 12:13.190
And that was how a more ethereal and thin
xiao long bao was invented.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.070
[Chang] I have a restaurant in Sydney
and there's a Din Tai Fung next to it,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.281
so I know it really well.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.743
It's probably the benchmark
for any franchise restaurant in the world.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.495
-Yeah.
-Everyone loves it.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.164
-Everybody loves it.
-Everyone loves it.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.290
[Wong] Yeah.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.001
[Chang] But Din Tai Fung is famous
for its soup dumpling.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.252
[Wong] Yeah.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.130
I had to squish that little jelly jizz

12:36.213 --> 12:38.299
that's supposed to, like,
squirt in your mouth.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.009
-That's so crucial. Yeah.
-Yes.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.635
"The jelly jizz."
I've never heard that.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.721
-The jelly... The little cube. Yeah.
-[Chang] Yes.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.514
[waitress] Are we all set to order here?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.183
We wanna go with
some xiao long bao, right?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.100
[Chang and Wong] Yeah.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.769
Classic pork. If you like seafood,
we have pork and crab.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.731
And then, of course, our delicacy as well,
the truffle mushroom.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.484
-One of these, each.
-One of each. Of course.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.694
All right, let me get everything started
for you, all right?

12:58.777 --> 13:00.196
-Thank you.
-Of course.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.199
That was extraordinarily bright service.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.992
-Yeah. Like, too bright.
-Too bright?

13:05.075 --> 13:09.288
Where you worry that the quality's bad.
You want them to ignore you.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.040
I love that part of your stand-up

13:11.123 --> 13:13.709
where it's like,
the Vietnamese restaurant you want...

13:13.792 --> 13:17.421
A good one is gonna have, like,
a copy machine,

13:17.505 --> 13:20.382
-and cleaning--
-That yellow bucket with the mop inside.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.345
The shelf with the pink opaque soap
in the, like, gallon jug.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.306
But then, like, the white people
like the clean bathroom,

13:27.389 --> 13:30.809
the pleasant servers who, like,
pay attention

13:30.893 --> 13:33.562
and bring you, like, a beverage
when you ask for it.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
[Chang] But I think today,

13:35.481 --> 13:38.150
with just what's available
on your phone and the Internet,

13:38.234 --> 13:41.612
you can pretty much nail down
what are, like, some of the go-tos.

13:41.695 --> 13:45.491
Right. But Yelp is still not trustworthy.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.243
'Cause I think as a whole,
as an aggregate,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.662
it does tell you
more than most people think.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.665
Right. But then there's those
who fuck it up.

13:52.748 --> 13:57.545
Where, like, they mislead me to some
whack-ass pho place because it was...

13:57.628 --> 14:00.798
People were polite and the bathroom's nice
and that's why they like it.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.050
Then it's like, "This broth is bullshit!"

14:03.133 --> 14:05.636
So, what you're really
advocating for is...

14:05.719 --> 14:07.304
[chuckling] What I'm trying to say is,

14:07.388 --> 14:11.976
I wanna know what percentage
that gave it five stars are Asian?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.353
-[laughs]
-That's all I wanna know.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.313
-Hey. Hi, my name is Aaron.
-[Wong] Hi.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.357
I'm part of the family business here
at Din Tai Fung.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.150
Thank you for stopping by our restaurant.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.361
Are you guys interested in our dumplings?

14:22.444 --> 14:26.156
We have no interest in the dumplings.
We find this place... [laughs]

14:26.240 --> 14:27.408
Yes, of course.

14:27.491 --> 14:31.787
We're really well-known for our soup
dumplings, or xiao long bao in Chinese.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.498
So, when you bite into it,
the soup just explodes in your mouth

14:34.582 --> 14:36.792
-and it's very popular.
-[whispers] The jizz.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.168
The dumpling jizz.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.712
Dumpling... Yeah, okay.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.213
-[Chang chuckles] Thank you.
-[laughing]

14:41.297 --> 14:42.256
[Aaron] Never heard it.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.926
I'm sure your founding ancestors
will really appreciate

14:46.010 --> 14:49.013
me referring to the xiao long bao juice
as dumpling jizz.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.725
Thank you for going there.
'Cause now I'm free to do whatever I want.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.396
[Aaron] There you go.

14:58.105 --> 15:02.818
All right, so, this is where our dumpling
chefs are making everything from scratch.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.987
When people come in to work
for Din Tai Fung,

15:05.070 --> 15:06.864
how do they pick, like, what station
they're gonna be at?

15:06.947 --> 15:09.241
Is it like Harry Potter,
where you put on a hat

15:09.325 --> 15:14.163
and you get to be in Slytherin or,
like, Rolling School or...

15:14.246 --> 15:16.874
[Aaron] Right.
It's kinda like an apprenticeship.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.629
Making soup dumplings looks easy to do,

15:21.712 --> 15:23.631
but it's insanely hard
to actually do. [chuckles]

15:23.714 --> 15:24.673
[Aaron] Yeah.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.428
-[Chang] How good are you at this?
-[Aaron] Uh, I'm okay.

15:29.511 --> 15:34.725
Just pinch, like steps kinda, actually.
It gets messy.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.853
-Well, that's horrifying.
-Pretty good for your first try.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.690
You got it closed.
It'll probably steam and stay inside.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.068
-Whoa! Look, that looks really good!
-No, no.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.903
That has the little hole in the middle.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.949
This is the one I made.
This is the one that expert here made.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.825
[laughing]

15:53.285 --> 15:56.330
[Meehan] "Do you guys have anything
other than ravioli?" is the question.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
Do I have anything other than ravioli?

15:57.873 --> 16:01.627
Oh, my God. Ravioli, agnolotti,
tortellini, tordelli.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.296
I mean, I could stand there all day
and name shapes.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.798
Well, stand all day.
I'll give you one minute.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.468
We have, uh, manicotti. We have...

16:09.551 --> 16:10.678
[inhales]

16:10.761 --> 16:13.889
You know what,
that's probably all we need.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.307
They have six.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.351
-They have six.
-[audience laughing]

16:17.434 --> 16:18.644
Are we not gonna eat anything?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.438
I thought we were gonna get food.
We're not getting anything to eat here?

16:21.522 --> 16:25.192
I'm trying to illustrate
that the Asian dumpling has more variety.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.486
It has more fillings.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.656
And, most importantly,
is it's so humble in its nature.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.659
-Oh, God. Oh, my God.
-It feeds many different kinds of people.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.662
I think that the sheng jian bao
of Shanghai

16:36.745 --> 16:38.998
is the most underrated dumpling.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.583
And I'd argue
it's the greatest in the world.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.587
It's like a pan-fried soup dumpling,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.841
but the wrapper
is a leavened, yeast-risen dough.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.137
It was designed to give to workers
as they went to the factory.

16:53.220 --> 16:59.184
So it's sturdy, it has soup in it,
it's a world-class dumpling,

16:59.268 --> 17:02.479
and I don't think there's any dumpling
that even comes remotely close to it.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.605
High or low.

17:05.398 --> 17:08.902
So, Gary, like, I look at this,
I see a bunch of Chinese grandmas.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.488
It's made from scratch.
It's delicious.

17:11.571 --> 17:14.657
It has all the sensibilities
of why people like Italian food.

17:14.742 --> 17:19.371
But there's something
more satisfying to me, eating this.

17:19.454 --> 17:23.208
The flavor you're used to
when you're growing up is very important.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.420
-It sticks with you forever, you know?
-Nostalgia wins out.

17:26.502 --> 17:30.466
Exactly. I trained myself to make
soup dumpling for two months.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.802
But recently, finally,
I got the flavor right.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.182
[Chang] For someone that was
born and raised in Shanghai,

17:38.265 --> 17:40.851
where do you rank
Din Tai Fung for soup dumpling?

17:40.934 --> 17:44.480
-Is it as good or better than what's here?
-I would never go.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.190
-You would never go to Din Tai Fung?
-Yeah, never.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.442
Aren't the skins on Din Tai Fung
really nice?

17:49.026 --> 17:52.988
It is nice,
but if I cannot taste the beef? Fail.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.282
-So you're, like, a real purist?
-Yeah.

17:55.365 --> 17:59.161
[Chang] You introduced me to the
sheng jian bao. Steamed pan frying.

17:59.244 --> 18:04.958
When you add a little sugar in there,
you actually pull out umami more.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.878
So, you think the Shanghainese
have added sugar

18:07.961 --> 18:09.671
to make it a little bit more umami?

18:09.755 --> 18:10.964
-More xiao.
-Exactly.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.717
[Chang] Do they add gelatin in it?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.845
Yeah. Then you blend it,
put in to mix with the meat.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.642
And when I had it, I bit into it,

18:21.725 --> 18:23.769
and I didn't know
that there was soup in it.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.229
[Wang] Oh, okay. So you burned yourself.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.524
-And it squirted all over.
-It's really hot.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.443
[Chang] But it was one of those
revelations when you eat something,

18:31.527 --> 18:33.362
you're like, "What?"

18:34.071 --> 18:36.782
[Wang] This is my favorite.
Yeah, for sure.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.161
-Just a little bit.
-Oh, God.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.292
-Oh!
-See? It's a volcano. [chuckles]

18:50.379 --> 18:52.172
That's crazy.

18:52.881 --> 18:53.757
Oh, my God.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.636
[narrator] Now let's hear
from our CDS correspondent

18:57.719 --> 19:00.430
and international playboy,
Walter Green.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.934
[bell dings]

19:04.518 --> 19:07.729
[Green] So I'm gonna be sampling
a medley of pasta product.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.942
We've got a range of Asian dumpling,
then a range of some Italian ones.

19:12.025 --> 19:16.113
We'll pit these two beloved cultures
against each other to try to find

19:16.196 --> 19:19.867
who makes the best low-end
frozen version of that.

19:19.950 --> 19:20.784
[bell dings]

19:21.743 --> 19:24.079
This is Bob.
He's my friend for life.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.124
-He's been by my side through it all.
-I live to serve you, sir.

19:27.916 --> 19:31.336
[Green] So we're gonna be eating some
mini soupy pork buns.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.427
First thing I notice is they're lukewarm,
which is not the fault of any...

19:38.510 --> 19:39.678
Bob!

19:39.761 --> 19:44.349
It's fine. We all eat
some lukewarm things now and then.

19:44.433 --> 19:49.271
I give it a 6.5 and two-thirds out of 10.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.522
[bell dings]

19:50.606 --> 19:52.274
Pesto tortellini from Trader Giotto.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.445
Very, very bland.
There's not a lot there.

19:56.528 --> 20:01.533
I'll give this "trip to hell and back
in your mouth area."

20:01.617 --> 20:03.911
[maniacal laughter]

20:05.078 --> 20:08.081
Bob, I can't thank you enough
for all the work that you do.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.836
So, I will not. I will not thank you.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.338
-Very good, sir.
-[bell dings]

20:14.838 --> 20:16.840
[Green] Chef Boyardee beef ravioli.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.890
Not a fan at all.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.227
Sir, you should be ashamed of yourself
for the products you make.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.021
I'll give it a D-plus, just to be nice.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.689
You know, just thank you, again.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.616
It's sad, really,
because he won't let me in

20:42.699 --> 20:46.453
and he won't let us rise above
these surface-level conversations

20:46.536 --> 20:51.416
where it's like, he's my fake butler.
And I'm just some guy.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.086
[bell dings]

20:54.169 --> 20:56.004
[indistinct chatter]

21:00.759 --> 21:03.303
[Chang] There's a lot of things
in the culinary world I sort of dislike.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.181
Many things that I do these days
that I dislike,

21:06.265 --> 21:10.936
but the whole idea of being able
to feed people cheaply

21:11.019 --> 21:13.313
with something delicious is...

21:14.314 --> 21:17.025
That's, like, one of the best things
in the world.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.828
It doesn't really register as to why
it's a place I try to avoid.

21:27.911 --> 21:31.206
I think I try to avoid the past
in everything I do.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.378
But I can't remember where the fuck it is.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.757
I was 24. First time living in Tokyo,
I didn't know a soul.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.259
Didn't speak the language.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.680
And I had been asking everyone I knew

21:46.763 --> 21:49.599
if I could get a job working
in a ramen shop,

21:49.683 --> 21:54.771
'cause I was relatively disillusioned,
working at fancier restaurants.

21:54.855 --> 21:58.275
And I wanted to do something
that was completely not happening.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.986
I got really lucky.

22:01.069 --> 22:04.614
[Chang] I got a job at a soba shop
called Fu-Yu-Rin in Mei-dae-mae.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.869
I remember getting a call from my dad

22:08.952 --> 22:12.539
saying, like, my aunt is doing work
with this reverend

22:12.622 --> 22:14.583
and one of things he had was a building

22:14.666 --> 22:17.586
where homeless people
that were being rehabilitated lived.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.922
-This is it.
-[cameraman] Yeah?

22:21.006 --> 22:26.470
[Chang] I lived in the reverend's room,
so I saw a lot of crazy shit. [chuckles]

22:28.638 --> 22:31.266
I mean, I think that's why it's hard
for me to think about a lot of this stuff,

22:31.349 --> 22:35.520
'cause it was building relationships
with people that were struggling, so...

22:35.604 --> 22:37.898
I think I was struggling,
mentally, myself.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.525
I mean, I ran away from everything
to live here.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.239
Because of how I lived
and what I could afford,

22:46.323 --> 22:49.493
things that I would never have looked at
to be delicious

22:49.576 --> 22:52.079
were very, very delicious to me.

22:53.371 --> 22:57.042
What I experienced here
I think was burned into my psyche

22:57.125 --> 23:00.087
was that good food
should be available to everyone.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.638
[Carbone] At Carbone, the goal was,

23:09.721 --> 23:11.973
"Can we get a Michelin star
with this food?"

23:12.057 --> 23:14.559
That would be an enormous coup
for our culture.

23:15.352 --> 23:20.857
We would like to order some of our famous
dumplings, tortellini, lobster ravioli

23:20.941 --> 23:23.360
and then I wanna do a scungilli,

23:23.443 --> 23:26.154
so he can try it
even though it's not a dumpling.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.949
We'll do...
I want you to eat some scungilli.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.450
I don't know what that is.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.786
-We'll bring it right out for you, gents.
-[Carbone] Thank you.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.372
[Chang] We met at Cafe Boulud

23:35.455 --> 23:38.291
and you're working
with the best cooks around.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.293
And you know you're gonna get crushed,

23:40.377 --> 23:42.254
but you're gonna learn
the best techniques.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.880
[Carbone] You showed up day one
with chopsticks.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.798
[Chang] Chopsticks.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.134
AC calls me over and he's like,

23:47.217 --> 23:49.636
"What's going on with the kid
and the chopsticks in the corner?"

23:49.719 --> 23:50.846
And I was like, "Dude, I don't know."

23:50.929 --> 23:52.264
[Chang] Bro, I was just
ahead of the curve.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.974
Now everyone's using tweezers.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.768
I just was disillusioned,
coming back to America,

23:56.852 --> 23:59.563
'cause I had just come back from working
in Japan and I would tell everyone,

23:59.646 --> 24:02.274
"I don't know what the fuck I'm doing
here, I just wanna make noodles."

24:02.357 --> 24:04.776
-All you guys made fun of me. [chuckles]
-Yep.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.361
Incessantly.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.238
We would, like, whisper to each other,

24:08.321 --> 24:12.993
"This guy's leaving
and he's gonna go open a noodle shop."

24:13.076 --> 24:14.536
[Chang laughing]

24:14.619 --> 24:17.080
"Dumb! So dumb."

24:17.164 --> 24:19.624
And then a year later, you were, like,
on the cover of every magazine

24:19.708 --> 24:22.002
and we were still just sweating
our assess off in the kitchen like,

24:22.085 --> 24:23.795
"We are so dumb!"

24:24.379 --> 24:27.632
You doing Noodle Bar
at that time in the industry

24:27.716 --> 24:31.803
really moved forward chefs being owners.

24:32.888 --> 24:37.642
That completely changed the dynamic
of restaurants in the United States.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.227
It was a huge motivator for us.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.439
-[waiter] The tortellini al ragu.
-[Chang] Thank you.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.192
I don't think I've had this here.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.236
-Have I?
-[Carbone] Yeah, you were just drunk.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.322
[laughs] Probably.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.324
[Carbone laughs]

24:53.658 --> 24:54.743
[Chang] You guys had the vision

24:54.826 --> 24:57.579
that you wanted to change
Italian-American food.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.247
[Carbone]
Well, it started with preservation.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.416
We were worried that this thing
was gonna go away.

25:01.499 --> 25:05.670
The great Italian-American restaurants
had seen their heyday pass.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.005
[Chang] Right.

25:07.088 --> 25:11.468
[Carbone] The cuisine as a whole,
it got passed down and then watered down.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.971
A bowl of spaghetti
with a ladle full of sauce on top.

25:15.055 --> 25:18.892
Massive portions of food,
but it's a lot of shit.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.769
I don't want that.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.105
And we could take our training
and put it towards this,

25:24.189 --> 25:26.107
take what we've learned,
and all of our mentors,

25:26.191 --> 25:28.318
and put it towards the thing that we are.

25:29.444 --> 25:34.532
We were out to prove that
Italian-American was a regional cuisine.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.953
If you treat the United States
as a giant region of Italy,

25:38.036 --> 25:42.332
and take only the ingredients of America
and treat them as an Italian would,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.669
you're still making Italian food.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.213
Tell me that that's wrong.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.136
[Cristina Bowerman]
But tradition cannot be still.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.890
Cannot be like a painting in a museum
that stays there and you look at it.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.018
Like, "Wow, how pretty!"
Tradition can evolve.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.397
But where is Italian food gonna be
in 50 years, 100 years?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.816
It's gonna look awfully like
what it is today.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.817
-No.
-No?

26:08.900 --> 26:11.236
It's gonna be different. I mean,
think about the potatoes,

26:11.319 --> 26:12.737
think about the tomatoes.

26:12.821 --> 26:18.076
I mean, we would not have Italian cuisine
the way that we consider it right now

26:18.159 --> 26:20.996
had it not been
for ingredients and culture

26:21.079 --> 26:22.789
that comes from other side of the world.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.916
But then at what point...

26:25.000 --> 26:30.422
Who becomes the judge
for when something new becomes tradition?

26:30.505 --> 26:31.840
Who needs a judge?

26:31.923 --> 26:33.174
You're gonna have the tradition,

26:33.258 --> 26:35.844
you're gonna have the grandmothers
that have the tortellini made

26:35.927 --> 26:38.763
exactly the same way
that were made 100 years ago,

26:38.847 --> 26:40.724
but you're gonna have something else.

26:40.807 --> 26:44.102
A new kind of tortellini,
a new kind, maybe pasta.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.103
But that doesn't mean...

26:45.186 --> 26:47.939
One doesn't exclude the other
in my vocabulary.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.443
Let me take you to a place
that makes, uh, pasta.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.821
Daniela and Monica,
they are, like, two sisters,

26:54.904 --> 26:57.991
and, uh, they are specialized
in tortellini and tortelli.

27:02.245 --> 27:06.499
[in Italian] In Bologna, all raw products

27:06.583 --> 27:11.921
are studied
to make a fantastic dough, the sfoglia.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.007
And the eggs,

27:14.090 --> 27:16.760
as you can see, their yolk is dark yellow.

27:16.843 --> 27:20.055
And this gives the sfoglia
its wonderful color.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.765
[in English] Yeah,
that's something that you find in Italy.

27:21.848 --> 27:25.226
It's like, you can ask for
a yellow egg yolk.

27:25.310 --> 27:29.481
So, basically, what they do is that
they give a bunch of corn to the chickens.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.108
[Monica Zappoli]
We're very famous for ricotta cheese,

27:32.192 --> 27:35.070
so we have to stay
very, very straight in this.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.988
-[Chang] We spent time in Modena.
-[Daniela] Yes.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.699
And it sure seems like everyone in Modena

27:39.783 --> 27:42.327
doesn't like the tortellini or tortelloni

27:42.410 --> 27:44.371
-in Bologna.
-It's true. Yes, of course.

27:44.454 --> 27:49.042
[in Italian] Because Bologna and Modena
have always fought against each other.

27:49.125 --> 27:53.713
The origin of tortellino
dates back to 1325,

27:53.797 --> 27:56.758
to the famous Battle of Zappolino.

27:58.218 --> 28:04.974
The Modenese killed 3,000 Bolognese.
It was a real beating for Bologna!

28:05.809 --> 28:10.605
And Venus, the goddess
who had intervened in the battle,

28:11.147 --> 28:15.777
decided to take a nap
at an inn in Castelfranco Emilia.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.824
When the innkeeper went
to her bedroom to wake her up,

28:20.907 --> 28:23.118
he had a celestial vision.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.080
He saw her laying on her bed, naked,

28:27.163 --> 28:33.169
and he was really impressed
by her belly button.

28:33.253 --> 28:38.216
So he decided to reproduce
Venus' belly button with dough.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.636
[in English] So, basically,
the belly button always refers to life,

28:41.720 --> 28:45.056
because it's the umbilical cord
and that's life.

28:45.140 --> 28:49.811
And also, the tortelloni
has a shape of a heart, so, life as well.

28:49.894 --> 28:53.356
[Chang] Modena and Bologna,
to me, without even coming here,

28:53.440 --> 28:54.733
I was like, it's the same thing.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.025
[Bowerman] Yeah. And no.

28:56.109 --> 28:59.696
[in Italian] Everything changes.
In Italy, you travel just 30 kilometers,

28:59.779 --> 29:01.740
and everything is different.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.951
Raw materials change completely.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.581
[in English] Very good.
The first tortelloni very good.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.082
What do you prefer?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.793
-Asian dumpling, stuffed Italian pasta?
-[sighs] God.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.046
Are you making me argue
with every single Italian that I know?

29:17.130 --> 29:18.590
Yes. Yes.

29:18.673 --> 29:21.176
-I love Asian food. I really do.
-Thank you. Thank you.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.595
-Thank you! [laughing]
-[speaking indistinctly]

29:25.513 --> 29:29.225
I will concede that whether it be
in a simple trattoria in Italy,

29:29.309 --> 29:32.145
or a fancy restaurant here
in New York City,

29:32.228 --> 29:37.609
that a specific stuffed pasta dish
is delicious...

29:37.692 --> 29:42.238
What about pumpkin ravioli
with a brown butter and sage?

29:42.322 --> 29:45.992
But it's so singular in its focus.
It's a one-trick pony.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.243
-[Carbone] You know what I hear?
-What's that?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.661
-Jealousy.
-[audience laughing]

29:48.745 --> 29:53.583
No, I'm angry at the fact
that Italy is so overrated in its food

29:53.666 --> 29:57.420
and that all of Asian cuisine doesn't get
the representation that it deserves.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

30:07.013 --> 30:08.723
[Wong] I don't know why
I like to eat these with my hands.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.601
I'm a real, like, handsy pervert
when it comes to dumplings. [laughs]

30:11.684 --> 30:13.603
I'm like, "Come over here
and let me feel you."

30:15.814 --> 30:18.483
[Chang] It's just delicious, too, right?

30:18.566 --> 30:21.528
So, this is never...
Even though it has a Michelin star,

30:21.611 --> 30:23.238
soup dumplings
and dumplings in general,

30:23.321 --> 30:26.241
it's never considered as artistic
and beautiful, as like a ravioli.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.784
Or delicate. Right.

30:27.867 --> 30:30.203
Here's another thing.
This price point, right?

30:30.286 --> 30:34.249
If I had this plate, and I put it
on a plate of ravioli...

30:34.332 --> 30:35.792
-Like, three of them.
-Three of them.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.126
For three times the price.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.878
Yeah, and it's with ricotta
and it's delicious.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.923
I'd eat it, you'd eat it,
but it'd be, like, 27, 28 bucks.

30:42.006 --> 30:42.841
Yeah.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.760
This is eight bucks. Or eight, nine bucks.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.512
Why is that?

30:49.347 --> 30:51.182
That's the shit that gets me mad.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.809
Well, it doesn't get me mad.

30:52.892 --> 30:56.688
It just makes me feel like
non-Asian people get bamboozled easier.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.605
[laughs]

30:57.689 --> 31:00.942
'Cause I hope they do not catch on,
and feel like they can... [chuckles]

31:02.193 --> 31:04.529
Don't tell them
what Italian people are doing.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.115
'Cause if they start charging more,
it would be, like, outrage.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.951
I think everybody knows
that what you're paying for is ambience,

31:10.034 --> 31:12.996
and some bullshit story about
where mushrooms came from from the waiter.

31:13.079 --> 31:13.955
[laughs] Right.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.457
And people eat that shit up.
I eat that shit up.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.711
But I don't think anybody
who really knows food,

31:19.794 --> 31:22.463
really thinks that that food is better.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.180
[Chang] I'm really struggling
with this idea.

31:31.264 --> 31:36.144
How does food become legitimate
because of its environment?

31:37.312 --> 31:41.399
Traditionally, fine dining
was white tablecloths, linens,

31:41.482 --> 31:43.902
flowers, people in penguin suits,

31:43.985 --> 31:47.530
and for many years,
that was where the best food lived.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.996
And it's something
I think I've historically

31:55.079 --> 31:57.373
always tried to push the buttons of,

31:57.457 --> 32:00.251
is stripping away the nonsense
and just getting to the food.

32:03.630 --> 32:09.093
A dumpling, whether it's Italian or Asian,
is something that is humble in origin.

32:12.180 --> 32:17.518
It's about stretching ingredients,
using scraps, being as frugal as possible.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.944
Do you make
the best dumplings in the area?

32:26.027 --> 32:28.613
[in Mandarin] Well, I wouldn't say that!
[chuckling]

32:28.696 --> 32:30.031
Just average.

32:31.449 --> 32:34.744
We northerners love eating dumplings.
[chuckles]

32:36.704 --> 32:38.957
For dumplings, chop the leaves,
not the root.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.584
Chopping the root
makes the water come out.

32:42.251 --> 32:44.629
[Chang in English] Do all the vegetables
come from her garden?

32:44.712 --> 32:45.964
[Wei in Mandarin] I planted them myself.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.633
The dough for dumplings
requires cool water.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.843
[Chang in English]
Do you have running water?

32:51.552 --> 32:52.428
[Wei chuckles]

32:53.012 --> 32:54.555
[in Mandarin] There's no water now.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.807
[translator]
Because it's cold? It's frozen?

32:55.890 --> 32:56.849
No, not that.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.769
We have half-day water here.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.230
Yeah. We don't have any now.
After 9:00 a.m., there's no more.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.356
[Chang in English] Wow.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.859
[Wei in Mandarin] And now the filling.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.447
Spring onions, ginger, garlic.
Then add salt.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.366
Monosodium glutamate.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.742
[Chang in English] MSG?

33:15.535 --> 33:16.661
[in Mandarin] Dark soy sauce.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.164
This is sunflower oil.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.376
This'll do.

33:23.459 --> 33:27.922
[Chang] The fact that they don't have gas,
no running water...

33:28.006 --> 33:32.844
When I just sort of fathom how hard it is
for them to make everything,

33:32.927 --> 33:35.096
that's when I was like,
"Oh, it's a privilege to be here."

33:46.315 --> 33:47.859
It feels like growing up at home.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.194
The women in my family
used to just make dumplings.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.697
They would just make
hundreds and hundreds.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.992
This isn't so different than, like,
an Italian grandma

33:56.075 --> 33:59.912
making, you know,
a ravioli or something like that.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.333
[Wei in Mandarin] Try wrapping them.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.255
[in English] It's like they're
putting pressure in...

34:12.257 --> 34:14.802
They make it look so easy.
It's not easy at all.

34:14.886 --> 34:20.933
Look how beautiful theirs are
and how stone-hands-like mine are.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.770
How long would it take for me
to get good at this?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.730
[in Mandarin] It wouldn't take long.

34:25.813 --> 34:29.358
[woman] Pretty quick. Two months.

34:29.442 --> 34:34.155
[Wei] You're like our kid. We wrap
dumplings and you want to help out.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.914
Stuff some of the firewood in
and the water will boil.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.505
[Chang in English] I just think
that when you make food this way,

34:50.588 --> 34:52.422
it's gotta taste better.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.760
'Cause you worked so goddamn hard.
It's like, "How much do you care?"

34:56.928 --> 34:59.972
When you realize, from start to finish,
you've been busting your ass, you know,

35:00.056 --> 35:04.852
why would you go so far into this process
only to make it taste halfway?

35:04.936 --> 35:08.189
[in Mandarin] Hu, I'll give you this tray.
Give me that tray.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.567
[sighs]

35:11.651 --> 35:14.445
[in English] She doesn't wanna cook mine.
[chuckles]

35:16.697 --> 35:19.784
[in Mandarin] Those would burst
if they were boiled. [laughs]

35:22.120 --> 35:24.038
[Chang in English] That looks so cool.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.374
Looks so cool.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.588
[indistinct chatter]

35:36.008 --> 35:40.513
[in Italian] So, like that. Okay, not bad.
You only put little filling, little pesto.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.765
How beautiful! How beautiful!

35:44.267 --> 35:45.601
How is it going?

35:45.685 --> 35:47.895
Very well.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.690
Well, very well.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.025
Very well.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.696
-Buongiorno.
-Buongiorno, David.

35:56.779 --> 35:58.573
[Chang in English] It's almost
every Saturday they're trying to do this?

35:58.656 --> 36:00.491
-[Bottura] Two times a week.
-Two times a week.

36:00.575 --> 36:05.246
And the grandmothers, they transfer
the knowledge to the kids as--

36:05.329 --> 36:06.539
[Chang] So it's the nonnas' ideas.

36:06.622 --> 36:11.878
Yes. Point was, what they're gonna do,
these kids?

36:11.961 --> 36:15.256
Once, uh, the school is over, high school.
You know?

36:15.339 --> 36:17.967
So, they start like this, you know?

36:18.050 --> 36:23.222
To produce something with their finger,
work with a little movement.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.641
But the idea is the grandmother,

36:25.725 --> 36:30.646
they have, uh, all this knowledge
since their grandmothers...

36:30.730 --> 36:35.109
Why don't we transfer that knowledge
to these kids?

36:35.193 --> 36:41.782
They're gonna be like the witness,
the people carrying the knowledge.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.455
[Chang] I just feel like this whole...

36:47.538 --> 36:50.666
The history of it, passing down
from generation to generation,

36:50.750 --> 36:53.753
-this is, like, a transcultural thing.
-Yeah.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.881
I did this with my mother and grandmother.

36:56.964 --> 37:00.301
[Bottura] I couldn't be the one I am

37:00.384 --> 37:06.390
if my grandmother didn't transfer
this kind of, uh, emotional experience

37:06.474 --> 37:07.892
when I was a kid.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.270
But look at that.

37:11.354 --> 37:16.234
What is the meaning of the tortellino?
That each one of them is totally different

37:16.317 --> 37:20.655
because it is reflecting the personality
of each one of us.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.797
[Taka Kondo] Hmm. Mmm-hmm.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.049
That's real good.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.178
[Chang] Fuck. Food here is so good.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.263
[Kondo] Yeah.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.597
This market, I like it.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.850
You've been in Modena ten years.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.143
Yeah, more like 13 years.

37:51.227 --> 37:54.814
Thirteen years. And you moved from Tokyo
straight to here?

37:54.897 --> 37:58.442
[Kondo] Yeah. I always worked
at an Italian restaurant in Japan.

37:58.526 --> 38:02.655
-Right.
-I wanted to see Italian culture in Italy.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.574
You know, Japanese are, like,
more focused.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.160
Italian people more creative.

38:12.164 --> 38:15.042
Taka's gonna make the Osteria version
of the tortellini.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.799
But do you think the Modena tortellini
has reached the evolutionary peak?

38:21.882 --> 38:23.175
Is that... Can't be better.

38:23.259 --> 38:27.680
[Bottura] In the last ten years,
we developed the perfect filling,

38:27.763 --> 38:29.890
with the perfect parmigiano,
the perfect prosciutto,

38:29.974 --> 38:34.186
the perfect mortadella.
Yes, I think we reached the peak.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.780
[chuckling] It's delicious.
What a surprise.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.995
I think we're gonna try to make, uh,
in theory,

38:51.078 --> 38:54.123
tiny, tiny wontons,
essentially, in a tortellini.

38:54.206 --> 38:57.585
Because tortellini en brodo
is the same thing as wonton soup, so...

38:57.668 --> 39:01.964
I was trying to make, like,
dumplings in the form of tortellini.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.133
We have some pork
and we have some veal in here.

39:04.216 --> 39:09.847
I'm not sure about any of this stuff.
I feel like I'm in enemy territory here.

39:09.930 --> 39:13.517
But number one, I discovered,
you actually need egg,

39:13.601 --> 39:16.979
or some kind of different flour
to make it a little bit more sturdy.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.025
Such a wet dough.

39:21.108 --> 39:25.488
Everything was going swimmingly well and
I needed some flour to roll out my dough,

39:25.571 --> 39:28.616
and then, all of a sudden,
a bucket appeared,

39:28.699 --> 39:33.162
and I start folding some in,
I put some on the board...

39:33.245 --> 39:37.666
[chuckles] And then all of a sudden
I'm like, "What the fuck's going on?"

39:37.750 --> 39:38.793
[laughs] What happened?

39:38.876 --> 39:42.380
My dough starts to just, like,
melt, almost. It's so sticky.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.839
And then Taka's like...

39:44.507 --> 39:45.674
This is rice flour?

39:45.758 --> 39:48.761
Is this flour? It's not flour.

39:48.844 --> 39:49.762
This is--

39:49.845 --> 39:52.014
-This is maltodextrin.
-[laughs]

39:53.140 --> 39:57.436
-Tapioca maltodextrin! I put it all on--
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.481
-Taka sabotaged me.
-[Kondo chuckles]

40:00.564 --> 40:03.317
-But he's on your side, Taka, come on!
-[laughing]

40:03.984 --> 40:05.361
[Chang] Oh, I'm so stupid.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.197
I can't believe I put maltodextrin
on my goddamn flour.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.074
[laughing]

40:10.157 --> 40:13.285
Worst thing in the world you could add.

40:19.125 --> 40:23.254
-Sorry, guys. The dough is terrible.
-Yeah.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.172
[laughing]

40:25.923 --> 40:27.174
[coughs]

40:27.925 --> 40:29.093
[Chang] Oh.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.262
I've been humbled.

40:31.345 --> 40:35.182
Because I was never understanding
of the quality of the ingredients

40:35.266 --> 40:37.935
that goes into it, which is ultimately
what makes Italian food Italian food.

40:38.018 --> 40:38.978
Yeah.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.230
Whenever I'm making dumplings
or eating dumplings,

40:41.313 --> 40:43.274
I'm never thinking about
the quality of the ingredients.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.191
Absolutely.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.902
[Chang]
Can I eat a delicious dumpling? Yes.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.948
Is there a lot of craftsmanship that goes
into a soup dumpling? 100%.

40:51.031 --> 40:52.032
That's awesome.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.786
But I can't tell you
about the provenance of the meat,

40:55.870 --> 40:58.164
or the kind of crab or anything.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.291
Oh, I didn't see it
from your guys' perspective.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.504
I can't make dumplings
the same vein of a tortellini.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.798
I just can't merge cultures, right?

41:07.882 --> 41:10.050
That's not my story to tell.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.387
Maybe Taka's kids, 50 years from now,

41:13.471 --> 41:16.599
will be like, "I've an idea for gyoza."
And that happens.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.350
[Bottura] Absolutely!

41:18.434 --> 41:23.481
The tradition are changing because
it's the moving, all these migrants.

41:24.315 --> 41:31.071
And maybe there are new sparkle
of new flavors that are coming up.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.827
[Bowerman] There are some ingredients
in some dishes that would not even exist

41:36.911 --> 41:41.749
if that cross-pollination didn't exist
at one point in history.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.752
[Carbone] This is borderline Asian.
It's all umami.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.421
[Chang] I will say
where there's similarities,

41:47.505 --> 41:49.798
whether it be Italian
or Chinese dumplings,

41:49.882 --> 41:53.636
was the image of a grandma making it.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.846
I don't know, that's just love, right?

41:55.930 --> 41:58.891
Do you ever get tired of eating dumplings
and making dumplings?

41:59.642 --> 42:01.560
[in Mandarin] I wouldn't. [laughs]

42:02.269 --> 42:03.479
Eat up.

42:04.605 --> 42:07.024
[Bottura in English] And when you bite,
then you say...

42:07.107 --> 42:10.444
"Wow, what is this?
I never taste something like this."

42:10.528 --> 42:14.073
This is the very important point
for people like us.

42:14.156 --> 42:19.453
Because we are in search of perfection
and emotions in food.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.664
Because at the end, it's all about that.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.754
[Chang] I appreciate, again, my friend

42:28.837 --> 42:31.423
for coming
and talking about his people's food.

42:31.507 --> 42:35.844
And obviously, Italian food's the most
popular food in the world right now.

42:35.928 --> 42:39.348
I'd like to begin my closing statement

42:39.431 --> 42:43.269
by admitting how much
I absolutely love this man and his food.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.479
-[audience] Aw...
-I admire what you do

42:45.563 --> 42:47.189
-and I do love Asian noodles.
-[Chang] Mmm.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.357
Generally when I'm wasted.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.400
[laughing]

42:49.483 --> 42:51.777
And with that, we'll conclude
our debate tonight.

42:51.860 --> 42:53.404
There's no resolution to this.

42:53.487 --> 42:55.531
[audience applauding and cheering]

42:55.614 --> 42:57.908
I'm wearing a winter coat as a blazer.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.661
[audience applauding and cheering]

43:03.330 --> 43:04.498
[Chang] Hmm.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.584
