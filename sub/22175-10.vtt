the dark lips, and the shading

mouth looks harsh, and this is

{\an3}She found out I was
up for adoption after my

{\an3}mom dropped her rights,

I went to Haiti.

- To see the orphan crisis that

29:35.340 --> 29:39.944

that awareness of huge need.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.746
I came back from

29:41.813 --> 29:43.248
I needed to do something.

29:43.314 --> 29:45.150
{\an1}And over the years,
we encountered some friends

29:45.216 --> 29:48.853
{\an1}that were fostering locally,
so the need right here was so,

29:48.920 --> 29:51.890
so great, so we reached out
to a local organization to get

29:51.956 --> 29:53.992
certified to become
foster parents ourselves.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.627
We have a little
one with us right now.

She came to us when she was
two, and now she's three

and it does look like

29:59.998 --> 30:02.834
{\an1}she's moving towards adoption,
so we're excited about that.
