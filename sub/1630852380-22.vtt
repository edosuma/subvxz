00:12.012 --> 00:14.055
[up-tempo rock music playing]

00:14.139 --> 00:15.974
-[shrieks]
-[Liam] Sorry!

00:19.436 --> 00:20.562
Whoa!

00:20.645 --> 00:23.857
And time.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.859
Three minutes faster than last time.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.902
Better, but still room for improvement.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.988
Did you really rent out the room
until my due date?

00:30.071 --> 00:32.323
I know we're not inducing you
until next week,

00:32.407 --> 00:35.285
but now that you broke up with Adam,
we have time to decorate.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.163
So head on in there, take a look around,

00:38.246 --> 00:40.290
and tell me
if there's anything else you need.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.500
-Are you all good?
-Hmm?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.543
You seem tense.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.837
Is the board still trying to oust you?

00:45.920 --> 00:46.796
Yes.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.967
Ellen and her minions
are trying to take my office, my company,

00:51.050 --> 00:54.012
and my baby's legacy away from me.
They vote tomorrow.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.847
-And you don't have a majority?
-No.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.392
Because the board is still upset
over the whole Morell catastrophe.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.228
So now I have to get them
to change their votes.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.230
If I can't, I'll figure out some other way

01:04.314 --> 01:05.982
to get them to stop. Hi!

01:06.483 --> 01:09.069
Did you have the ceiling painted
to look like the sky?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.738
I thought it would be calming.
If you don't like it,

01:11.821 --> 01:14.491
we can easily change it
to a Sistine Chapel kind of thing.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.451
No?

01:16.534 --> 01:17.452
What, too much?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.750
Going to live on your yacht
like you've always wanted?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.877
The yacht has a name. <i>Freedom.</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:28.671
And, no, I'm going to the site
of the downed plane

01:28.755 --> 01:31.299
to join the extraction team
and look for Dex.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.843
-What?
-The plane's comms were fried,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.553
probably by a lightning strike.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.973
They landed off course
and probably went looking for help.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.060
Well, that's an optimistic theory,
but even if you're right,

01:42.143 --> 01:44.729
you will be more useful
helping me deal with the fallout

01:44.813 --> 01:46.481
instead of playing Rescue Ranger.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.108
Well, contrary to whoever died
and made you queen,

01:49.192 --> 01:50.568
PPA is still my company.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.696
I've already told everyone
who needs to know what happened,

01:53.780 --> 01:56.491
and they promised me 48 hours
to find their loved ones

01:56.574 --> 01:59.619
before going public for help.
So I'm leaving.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.412
You didn't tell everyone.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.330
[Alexis] Blake?

02:03.998 --> 02:06.751
Have you heard anything?
Did you make contact yet?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.295
We're doing everything we can.
I guess you told her.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.005
I thought she deserved to know.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.216
That my husband could be dead? Yes.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.176
I was going to tell you, all right?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.804
The plane landed somewhere
in the Appalachian Mountains.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.932
I'm joining the extraction team.
They have everything under control.

02:21.015 --> 02:24.269
If they haven't extracted Dex,
they have nothing under control.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.271
I'm going with you. If you try to stop me,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.982
I will leak the story
of your airline's failure

02:29.065 --> 02:32.235
to every network, paper
and podcast, so help me God.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.278
Fine.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.406
There's a car waiting out front.
Wheels up in 20 minutes.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.075
Now, I need to finish packing.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.121
How's the L.A. house-hunting going?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.415
I found a nice listing near the beach,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.042
but according to Nina,
it's not the right beach, so...

02:48.126 --> 02:50.295
Well, that's bad for you, great for me,

02:50.378 --> 02:52.881
since you'll be here
to deal with the jazz-night lineup.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.508
There are a few other issues
I need to talk to you about.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.344
When you move, we're gonna
have to set up a weekly FaceTime

02:58.428 --> 03:01.639
-to go over everything.
-Whoa. When I said I was leaving Atlanta,

03:01.723 --> 03:04.601
I thought you understood
that meant leaving the hotel as well.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.020
No. I did not understand that.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.980
And I can't afford to buy you out.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.649
I've lined up
potential investors to take my place.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.192
I'm meeting them this afternoon.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.112
Shouldn't I be involved
in picking who you're selling to?

03:16.195 --> 03:20.491
I mean, what if this person wants
to change the decor to shabby chic

03:20.575 --> 03:23.244
-or play country music at the club?
-Relax.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.289
They'll only be a minority shareholder.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.249
A real silent partner. Unlike me.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.628
But you should sit in if you want to.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.923
Don't worry. I will sit in.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.051
You shouldn't have
just shown up like that.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.594
No, I know. You're right. I--

03:40.178 --> 03:43.306
I made a mistake. I just--
I wanted some time to talk with you.

03:44.182 --> 03:48.186
Well, now you have it. So you can start
by telling me why you're here in Atlanta.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.649
I came here
to apologize for my past behavior.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.027
I did some very bad things to you
to protect my job,

03:56.569 --> 03:58.238
to protect my now ex-wife.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.033
-You and Sandra aren't together anymore?
-No.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.413
We've divorced, but I regret my actions.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.333
I was selfish. I'm here to make amends.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.173
Look, you don't need to make amends.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.593
I'm not some name on a list
you need to check off.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.887
Don't they have phones
in the U.K. anymore?

04:24.305 --> 04:27.934
I also wanted to see you
so that I could give you this.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.853
It's a job offer from a top London firm.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.856
I pulled some strings
to have them consider you.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.568
-And now they're very interested.
-Look, I didn't ask for a job.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.570
I have one.

04:39.654 --> 04:44.117
Right. Working on malpractice suits
and employment contracts at a hospital.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.913
[scoffs] This job will put you back
on the career path you've always wanted.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.581
I know you, Amanda.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.626
You might have left, but that doesn't mean
you lost your ambition.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.794
Just read it over,

04:55.461 --> 04:57.755
and then I won't bother you
about it again.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.929
Hey, do you know how to loosen a pipe?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.097
[Liam sighs]

05:06.180 --> 05:07.265
Oh, wow.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.976
-Is this the book cover?
-[Liam] Seems to be.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.270
[Sam] It has your name on it. Hmm.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.981
How uncomfortable does that make you feel?

05:15.064 --> 05:16.858
I told you, I did a rewrite.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.236
[sighs] But, yeah, I let this get too far.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.113
The book's not out yet.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.615
-It's not too late to come clean.
-No, it is too late.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.118
How would I even explain this, Sam?

05:27.201 --> 05:29.829
Plus, Kingston's nephew
is blackmailing his way to a condo

05:29.912 --> 05:30.955
and a big payday.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.709
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I'm gonna give him what he wants.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.169
-Get rid of him.
-Then what?

05:37.253 --> 05:40.298
Book signings, press tours, sequels?

05:41.549 --> 05:44.135
The Liam I know
won't be able to live with that.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.683
[tense music playing]

06:00.026 --> 06:02.695
Graham? All right.
What are we doing here? What's going on?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.447
You haven't figured it out yet?

06:04.530 --> 06:06.532
What do you want?
If you need money, I can--

06:06.616 --> 06:09.368
I don't want your money, Adam.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.578
Then what?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.335
[dramatic music playing]

06:25.218 --> 06:26.928
I want revenge.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.430
[theme music playing]

06:50.868 --> 06:54.330
We've searched roughly 70% of the area.
Still no trace of anyone.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.458
Plus, we have
a massive storm cell moving in,

06:57.542 --> 07:00.128
-and have to call the team back soon.
-Unacceptable.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.296
Not until you find my husband.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.382
-How much time?
-A couple of hours.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.384
We've narrowed it down

07:06.467 --> 07:09.303
to the two most likely areas
we believe they could be.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.097
There's no way
we have time to search both.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.682
Okay, let's go to Site F.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.684
This isn't "Pin the Tail
on the Plane Crash."

07:14.767 --> 07:17.270
-Do you know what you're talking about?
-Any pilot knows

07:17.353 --> 07:20.440
if you have to leave the aircraft,
you head to higher ground for visibility.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.316
Site F is a hill.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.944
What if Dex isn't with the pilot?
What if they split up?

07:25.027 --> 07:28.656
Well, I can't guarantee anything,
but this is our best plan of attack.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.159
-You have to trust me.
-When has that ever worked out?

07:31.242 --> 07:34.996
The longer we wait around here,
the less likely we are to find them alive.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.122
Okay.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.165
Let's go.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.041
And, yes, I'm coming with you.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.254
Steven?

07:43.337 --> 07:46.174
-This is crazy.
-It's a lot to process, isn't it?

07:46.257 --> 07:48.468
It was for me too
once I remembered everything.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.054
You know, how you convinced me
and the family that I'd lost my mind

07:52.138 --> 07:53.806
and had me institutionalized.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.726
And then you paid off a nurse
to feed me a steady drip of drugs

07:56.809 --> 07:58.895
while you basically took my place?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.105
Look, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.231
Oh.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.191
[grunts]

08:03.274 --> 08:07.111
Maybe you stop talking and just listen.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.157
Lucky for me, the sanitarium burned down.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.203
Not so lucky
for the nurse on your payroll who died.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.956
-I made it out with just a few burns.
-Wow, that is kind of lucky for you.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.418
Shut up.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.131
Once the drugs wore off,
it was like the clouds parted.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.176
I went to the dead nurse's house,

08:31.219 --> 08:35.890
and I found all the letters sent to me,
from Fallon, from Blake, from Sam,

08:35.973 --> 08:37.016
that she'd intercepted.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.229
Along with the checks
that you'd been sending her. Yeah.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.440
You're not gonna talk your way
out of this one, George.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.610
What are--? What are you gonna do?

08:48.778 --> 08:52.907
What I've been dreaming about doing
since I realized what you'd done to me.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.160
Steven. Steven, wait.
Let's-- Uh, let's talk about this.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.079
-No, no, no. Don't. Don't...
-Shh, shh, shh.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.664
[speaking in muffled voice]

08:59.747 --> 09:00.873
[knocking on door]

09:01.666 --> 09:03.167
[woman] Graham, are you in there?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.214
[Steven] Coming.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.885
Just doing a little inventory.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.221
[woman] Mrs. Carrington
needs you right away.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.973
Of course, I'll be right there.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.475
Uh, ask the staff not to come in here.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.271
There are some rodents inside
that need to be taken care of.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.364
How do you know
it was Plenexia behind this?

09:33.447 --> 09:36.409
Gemma told me. I caught her at the gym,
and she confessed.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.495
-You caught her at the gym?
-Yup. Apparently, that's the one thing

09:39.579 --> 09:41.747
she didn't lie about.
I guess she felt guilty enough

09:41.831 --> 09:45.167
to tell me that Richard Payne
is trying to decode the solar tech

09:45.251 --> 09:47.086
-she stole from me.
-And use it for what?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.879
Release the designs to the public.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.841
Poetic payback for what I did
to his medication.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.803
And look, before you ask me to stop,
I know exactly what I'm doing here.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.806
I have no intention of asking you to stop.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.766
Isn't this when you tell me to walk away?

10:00.850 --> 10:04.562
Normally, yes. But not when
someone plays with my son's heart.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.230
These people have gone too far.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.483
Thank you.
Like I said, I don't have a ton of time,

10:09.567 --> 10:12.194
and right now I'm not having
a ton of success getting in,

10:12.278 --> 10:14.322
so I just need to keep at it.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.199
Does this mean you're too busy
to help me save my company?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.119
Because I'm about
to lose Fallon Unlimited for good

10:20.202 --> 10:23.205
-unless I can get the board to back me.
-Look, I wish I could help.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.957
But your board won't listen to me,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.418
and I have my own company
to save at the moment.

10:27.501 --> 10:31.130
-I'm sure you'll figure it out, right?
-[scoffs] Well, I'm glad you're sure.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.091
Maybe I can help.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.678
-Really?
-That's what family is for, right?

10:38.679 --> 10:39.722
Occasionally.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.059
But I am desperate enough right now
to be interested.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.772
Great. Then I quit my FSN show,
effective immediately.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.193
As far as a return on investment,
La Mirage is a safe bet.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.153
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Jones.

10:54.236 --> 10:58.199
Uh, pipe burst in 428.
Leaked down to the room below.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.410
Water everywhere.
Just thought you should know.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.536
Thank you, Manny.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.247
Okay, that is not
a common occurrence here. [chuckles]

11:05.331 --> 11:08.417
-So as I was saying--
-Janice? Is everything okay?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.045
Actually, no.
I can't deal with the bedbugs.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.547
The guests are complaining,

from the broken pipe to put out the fire.

Did she seduce you
with her fancy judge words?

12:49.101 --> 12:52.104
Okay, first of all,
no one is seduced at 11 in the morning,

12:52.188 --> 12:53.689
and that's not why she's here.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.235
Oh, so she just had to stop by
on the way back to her flat in London?

12:58.319 --> 13:01.030
She actually came to give me a job offer.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.949
Okay, so, what's so special
about this job?

No.

Okay, yes. I was there.
But only because I was nervous.

Florence was the one, okay?

And maybe being around her
brought some of those old feelings up.

is sadness that you don't trust me.

that <i>Lauren's School for Ghouls</i>

Other than have lunch, obviously.

The best part is
Kingston gets all the credit.

No, the best part is
I only have to read the foreword.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.927
I just left my granddaughter
down the hall.

the smartest six-month-old, well, ever.

[Liam] We agree.

because we should probably get home.

I want you to be the first to know.
