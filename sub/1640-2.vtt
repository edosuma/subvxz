00:01.442 --> 00:03.890
Hurry up, Gabi. It's your
first day, you can't be late.

00:03.891 --> 00:07.312
I know, I know, I'm freaking out.
I can't find the right outfit.

00:08.302 --> 00:11.743
I need something that makes
me look professional, capable..

00:11.744 --> 00:13.495
And like I didn't sleep with my boss...

00:14.900 --> 00:17.429
Well, we know he likes you in that.

00:19.231 --> 00:20.551
Will you just help me, please?

00:20.552 --> 00:22.124
Okay, look, it's very simple.

00:22.125 --> 00:25.477
He's engaged, so from now on,
you're gonna have to wear clothes.

00:25.937 --> 00:28.189
I know that!

00:28.191 --> 00:30.351
- Did you work out?
- Yes.

00:30.352 --> 00:35.592
I jogged to the Car Dealership for
free donuts, to bank for free coffee.

00:36.999 --> 00:39.285
And to the coffee shop
for free toilet paper.

00:39.320 --> 00:42.657
Ooh, hey, that's like two miles.

00:42.658 --> 00:44.623
You totally won't have to
sneak into the gym later.

00:46.469 --> 00:48.417
Oh man!

00:48.528 --> 00:50.815
This cost five bucks!

00:52.264 --> 00:53.881
Gabi, get it together.

00:53.882 --> 00:55.708
Today is the first day
of your dream job, okay?

00:55.709 --> 00:57.827
It's a stepping stone to one day being

00:57.828 --> 01:01.020
a modern, blonder, way-hotter Julia Child.

01:02.177 --> 01:04.647
So I say this from the bottom of my heart:

01:05.060 --> 01:06.924
Don't screw it up.

01:08.113 --> 01:11.524
Is that the toilet flushing or my
self-confidence going down the drain?

01:13.081 --> 01:14.285
It's the toilet.

01:14.319 --> 01:16.237
I called the landlord three times.

01:16.778 --> 01:18.230
And if you want confidence,

01:18.907 --> 01:20.825
you're gonna need to power pose.

01:20.876 --> 01:22.209
Power what-now?

01:22.244 --> 01:23.994
It's where you stand like this.

01:24.045 --> 01:27.982
You put your hands on your
hips and say, "I got this!"

01:29.167 --> 01:31.919
I got this?

01:31.921 --> 01:34.054
Okay, it's not a question.

01:34.089 --> 01:35.131
Say it like you mean it,

01:35.132 --> 01:37.969
like your job and paying our
electric bill depend on it.

01:40.429 --> 01:42.493
I got this!

01:43.266 --> 01:44.678
Attagirl.

Good morning, Yolanda.

01:55.342 --> 01:57.877
♪ First day, time to cook away ♪

01:58.997 --> 02:00.946
All righty.

02:01.283 --> 02:02.721
What do I start with?

02:02.918 --> 02:04.274
Picking those up.

02:06.605 --> 02:08.883
I'm Josh's housekeeper, not yours.

02:10.091 --> 02:11.091
Sorry.

02:11.143 --> 02:13.319
♪ First day, I messed up already ♪

02:14.993 --> 02:17.651
And if you want to stay on
my good side... and you do...

02:18.804 --> 02:22.705
Keep your things in the laundry room,
the kitchen clean and please, stop singing.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.011
Well well well. Look who's back.

02:28.012 --> 02:31.058
Did you have sex with anybody
in the elevator on the way up?

02:32.541 --> 02:34.551
I was hoping we could
just have a fresh start

02:34.552 --> 02:36.727
and just never talk about that ever again.

02:37.389 --> 02:39.155
Aww. No.

02:40.822 --> 02:43.657
Elliot, can't you just pretend to like me?

02:43.708 --> 02:46.043
I stopped pretending to
like girls in high school.

02:49.097 --> 02:50.073
Don't pay attention to him.

02:50.074 --> 02:53.588
He's pissy because they discontinued
his favorite Khakis at the Baby Gap.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.819
Here's Josh and Caroline's breakfast order.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.506
Okay.

02:59.507 --> 03:01.412
Gabi, chop chop.

03:01.413 --> 03:03.401
Yolanda, mop mop.

03:05.414 --> 03:07.184
Okay, "pancakes, bacon".

03:07.185 --> 03:09.124
Um, how does Josh like his eggs?

03:09.125 --> 03:11.667
Like you. Over easy.

03:13.555 --> 03:15.359
Oh, and one tiny little thing.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.632
For dinner tonight, you need to
prepare an authentic Chinese meal

03:18.633 --> 03:21.296
for four investors flying in from Shanghai.

03:21.297 --> 03:23.975
No pressure, but it
does have to be perfect.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.608
Your resume did say you were
familiar with Guangzhou-style cooking.

03:30.705 --> 03:31.705
It did?

03:32.874 --> 03:35.426
I mean, it did.

03:35.477 --> 03:37.561
Don't worry, Elliot.

03:37.612 --> 03:38.812
I got this.

03:38.864 --> 03:42.533
What the hell is Guangzhou-style cooking?

03:44.619 --> 03:46.620
It's so big.

03:47.839 --> 03:50.457
Really?

03:50.459 --> 03:51.759
I was worried about the size.

03:51.793 --> 03:54.862
I'm putting it on Instagram
so all my friends can see it.

03:57.409 --> 04:00.324
I love my new ring so much.

04:01.884 --> 04:03.077
And you.

04:04.251 --> 04:05.580
Oh, don't forget.

04:05.581 --> 04:06.945
Tonight I'm hosting that business dinner.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.622
I cannot wait to introduce
you as my fiancee.

04:09.623 --> 04:11.184
Oh, sweetie. About that, um...

04:11.185 --> 04:12.279
You're gonna be there, right?

04:12.280 --> 04:15.419
Absolutely... in spirit.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.286
Listen, honey, I'm
going out with my friends

04:18.286 --> 04:21.396
to show off my gorgeous new
ring from my gorgeous new fiance.

04:21.397 --> 04:23.351
You understand, right?

04:23.352 --> 04:24.996
Fine.

04:24.997 --> 04:26.947
Why do you have to be so pretty?

04:26.948 --> 04:30.184
I love you so much.

04:30.185 --> 04:32.640
I'm gonna miss you while I'm in the shower.

04:32.641 --> 04:34.137
And I love you.

04:34.138 --> 04:35.666
I was talking to my ring.

04:36.762 --> 04:40.044
'Cause you I'm taking with me.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.331
Oh yeah?

04:43.478 --> 04:45.346
Good morning.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.614
Oh, good morning, Josh...

04:46.648 --> 04:48.616
Uh, Mr. Kaminski.

04:48.667 --> 04:49.617
Boss Kaminski.

04:51.453 --> 04:53.487
I'm sorry, I
don't know what to call you.

04:53.521 --> 04:56.114
Some people call me Kick-ass Kaminski.

04:56.938 --> 04:58.675
Nobody calls you that.

05:00.137 --> 05:02.769
They would if you didn't
shoot it down all the time.

05:04.232 --> 05:05.532
- Josh is fine.
- Okay.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.402
- Welcome to your first official day.
- Oh, thanks. Glad to be here.

05:08.404 --> 05:10.120
Here's your first official meal.

05:10.155 --> 05:11.577
Oh, nice.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.976
You made my initials out of bacon.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.559
Yeah, you know, I was
gonna spell your whole name,

05:15.560 --> 05:17.684
but I didn't want to give you
your first official heart attack.

05:18.263 --> 05:21.348
Um, so we're good, right?

05:21.399 --> 05:23.484
Good? Oh! Oh, yeah yeah yeah, we're great.

05:23.518 --> 05:27.271
You know, what happened between us at
the test dinner was just like a silly

05:27.322 --> 05:31.091
drunken mistake that, you know, thanks
to the alcohol I just hardly remember.

05:31.126 --> 05:34.428
But what I'm trying to say is I really
don't think of you in, like, a sexy

05:34.462 --> 05:36.163
or, like, a hot way.

05:36.231 --> 05:40.167
You know, I really just think of you
in, like, a totally professional way.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.272
I was talking about dinner.

05:47.359 --> 05:49.410
Yeah, so was I.

05:50.945 --> 05:55.082
I think of tonight's dinner in,
like, a totally professional way.

05:56.334 --> 05:58.085
Turned that right around.

06:00.221 --> 06:02.022
Caroline.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.858
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

06:05.927 --> 06:09.196
Gluten-free muffin I just... bakey.

06:10.999 --> 06:15.002
Beautiful breakfast tray for a room
I am completely unfamiliar with.

06:15.036 --> 06:17.121
Oh shoot.

06:17.172 --> 06:18.972
Get it together, Gabi.

06:19.007 --> 06:20.808
You got this.

06:20.842 --> 06:22.843
I got this!

06:22.894 --> 06:25.062
You got what?

06:26.781 --> 06:28.899
I got, uh, this!

06:28.950 --> 06:31.952
Your breakfast, Milady.

06:38.527 --> 06:41.378
Okay, breakfast is served.

06:41.413 --> 06:43.464
Thank God it's the most
important meal of the day

06:43.515 --> 06:45.633
because tonight's dinner
is going to be a bitch!

06:48.287 --> 06:50.604
Okay, I need button mushrooms,

06:50.639 --> 06:54.558
sterauce, ginger, catfish,
two ducks, and a wok.

06:54.609 --> 06:57.828
Eh, I don't think you have time for a
walk if you got to get all that stuff.

07:00.332 --> 07:04.502
I just wish I'd had a tad more notice!

07:04.553 --> 07:07.304
And been a tad more truthful on resume.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.473
Stop worrying. You are a good cook.

07:09.524 --> 07:13.360
You are going to nail this and be
around here for a long long time.

07:15.896 --> 07:18.017
- Caroline, what's wrong?
- My ring's missing.

07:18.018 --> 07:20.698
And that little cook girl stole it.

07:20.699 --> 07:23.186
Oh, you're so fired.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.241
Caroline, I'm sure Gabi
didn't take your ring.

07:28.242 --> 07:32.328
But, Juju, she was looking guilty
in the bedroom saying, "I got this".

07:32.362 --> 07:34.247
No, no, no, no.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.557
That's because you caught me
in the middle of my power pose.

07:36.558 --> 07:38.705
It helps me with my confidence.

07:40.354 --> 07:42.922
Not so much now.

07:42.924 --> 07:45.391
Damn, I never thought I'd
see the day when a white girl

07:45.393 --> 07:48.261
gets fingered before the
black housekeeper.

07:48.295 --> 07:50.062
All right, look, there's got
to be another explanation.

07:50.113 --> 07:51.280
I totally trust my staff.

07:51.315 --> 07:54.000
Oh, that's what I love about you, Juju.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.202
You think everyone's so good and honest.

07:56.204 --> 07:58.304
- I do.
- I don't.

07:59.256 --> 08:01.090
I agree with Caroline.

08:01.141 --> 08:02.925
Gabi isn't a cook, she's a crook.

08:04.061 --> 08:05.928
Okay, look.

08:06.013 --> 08:08.014
Everyone... everyone relax.

08:08.065 --> 08:10.066
I have the entire penthouse
wired with security cameras.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.118
We can just go to the manager's
office and get the footage.

08:12.152 --> 08:13.869
- We can?
- Yes.

08:13.904 --> 08:15.871
Oh, Juju. Let's go.

08:18.175 --> 08:20.059
Oh my God.

08:20.093 --> 08:22.128
Worst first day ever.

08:22.130 --> 08:24.130
You know I didn't steal
that ring, right, Yolanda?

08:24.132 --> 08:26.098
Of course you didn't. You're innocent.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.767
Huh?

08:27.818 --> 08:29.185
And watching that security tape

08:29.236 --> 08:31.854
is a huge invasion of
privacy. We should stop them.

08:33.907 --> 08:36.708
Elliot, why are you suddenly on my side?

08:36.743 --> 08:38.995
'Cause it's not fair.

08:39.046 --> 08:42.114
And why do you have a sweat mustache?

08:42.149 --> 08:44.800
Why do you have a real mustache?

08:49.139 --> 08:51.724
And why are you wearing

08:51.726 --> 08:52.975
an oven mitt?

08:53.026 --> 08:54.827
I didn't see that coming.

08:56.747 --> 08:57.997
I couldn't help myself.

08:58.031 --> 09:00.583
I saw it on the nightstand
and I had to try it on.

09:01.735 --> 09:04.837
Now it's stuck. And I'm going to get fired.

09:06.673 --> 09:08.674
This is the best job I've ever had.

09:08.676 --> 09:10.810
All right, don't worry.
We'll help you get it off.

09:10.844 --> 09:12.895
Wait wait wait. Hold
up, Gabi. First, Elliot,

09:12.929 --> 09:16.048
- you got to beg.
- Oh, that's really not necessary.

09:16.066 --> 09:18.768
Please!

09:18.819 --> 09:21.854
I'll do anything you want!

09:21.856 --> 09:23.989
Come on, he needs us.

09:25.659 --> 09:26.692
Thank you, Gabi,

09:26.694 --> 09:28.694
I've always liked you best.

09:28.745 --> 09:30.863
Um...

09:30.865 --> 09:32.665
Your finger's really swollen.

09:32.699 --> 09:35.701
Oh, I got something that
can shrink things in a jiffy.

09:35.752 --> 09:36.919
Is it a picture of you naked?

09:40.791 --> 09:42.842
I'm sorry. It's a reflex.

09:43.927 --> 09:48.931
No, I was talking about hemorrhoid cream.

09:48.965 --> 09:50.800
Now hold still while I put it on.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.051
Hemorrhoid cream?!

09:52.102 --> 09:53.969
You want that ring off?

09:55.806 --> 09:56.939
Fine!

10:00.727 --> 10:02.611
Ah! Ah!

10:02.646 --> 10:04.730
On your finger, fool.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.784
Juju, when we watch this footage

10:08.869 --> 10:11.036
and you see that little
cook girl stealing my ring,

10:11.071 --> 10:14.907
you're not gonna get all violent, are you?

10:14.909 --> 10:16.826
No.

10:18.745 --> 10:20.012
Are you?

10:21.681 --> 10:23.833
It doesn't even matter.
She didn't take anything.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.718
Well, how can you be so sure?

10:25.752 --> 10:26.919
Did you do a backgroud check?

10:26.921 --> 10:28.921
I can assure you, I checked her out...

10:28.972 --> 10:30.756
Very thoroughly.

10:30.807 --> 10:32.675
- We're back.
- Oh, there you are.

10:32.726 --> 10:35.728
- Look who it is!
- Kick-ass Kaminski!

10:38.682 --> 10:40.933
Ooh, good news you two. Look what I found.

10:40.935 --> 10:42.685
My God!

10:42.736 --> 10:43.853
I love you. I love you.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.771
- Thank you.
- Where did you find it?

10:45.773 --> 10:47.823
In a bag of hot air.

10:49.693 --> 10:51.076
The vacuum cleaner.

10:51.111 --> 10:52.778
I checked it,

10:52.780 --> 10:55.865
and bam, there it was.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.082
Do you believe it?

10:58.752 --> 11:00.786
Do you believe it?

11:00.837 --> 11:02.705
Of course.

11:02.756 --> 11:04.089
See, Caroline. I told
you. My staff is...

11:04.124 --> 11:06.625
I don't remember dropping it on the floor.

11:06.676 --> 11:08.961
Well, I don't remember the
exact moment that I realized

11:08.963 --> 11:12.965
that you were the world's
most beautiful woman...

11:13.016 --> 11:14.767
But you are.

11:15.802 --> 11:17.069
Good point.

11:17.103 --> 11:21.640
Sweetie, isn't there something
you should say to Gabi?

11:21.642 --> 11:23.776
Yes.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.945
Thank you for finding my ring, Gabi.

11:28.815 --> 11:29.815
I'm Gabi.

11:33.854 --> 11:36.038
I'm sorry I accused you of stealing,

11:36.072 --> 11:39.708
but you were acting like you were
hiding something in the bedroom.

11:40.827 --> 11:42.661
Well, I wasn't...

11:43.713 --> 11:44.997
Hiding anything.

11:45.048 --> 11:47.666
Especially in your bedroom.

11:48.835 --> 11:51.971
The important thing is
you got your ring back.

11:52.005 --> 11:53.806
Yeah, and that I didn't steal it.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.674
I mean, I get why you think that I would.

11:55.725 --> 11:57.843
I'm totally in debt and
I could live off that ring

11:57.878 --> 11:59.895
for like 5, 6, 20 years.

11:59.930 --> 12:01.981
But, you know, I'm not stupid.

12:02.015 --> 12:03.849
If I wanted to steal
something, I would take

12:03.900 --> 12:07.770
something you wouldn't notice, like one of
the 10 laptops you guys just leave around!

12:09.689 --> 12:11.690
- Josh?
- Yo!

12:11.741 --> 12:13.609
She's so nervous.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.860
Listen to her babble.

12:14.862 --> 12:16.962
She's definitely hiding something.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.697
No no, I'm not hiding anything.

12:18.748 --> 12:20.783
I just babble. I'm a natural-born babbler.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.835
My parents should have named me Brooke.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.006
She said Brooke.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.757
I mean, you should have
seen me when I was here

12:28.792 --> 12:30.075
last week for the test
dinner. I just couldn't stop...

12:30.093 --> 12:32.962
That's right. You were here last week.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.714
Call the manager back.

12:35.765 --> 12:39.718
I want to see all the security footage
from the minute she walked into this house.

12:39.769 --> 12:42.721
That is so not necessary.

12:43.940 --> 12:47.126
I want to find out what else she's
put her dirty little hands on.

12:52.115 --> 12:55.784
Hmm, you two are so fired.

13:01.199 --> 13:03.300
That must be the manager
with the rest of the footage.

13:06.471 --> 13:09.056
Someone order a massage?

13:09.090 --> 13:12.309
Yes, for Caroline, because she's
having such a stressful day.

13:12.343 --> 13:16.179
Juju, that is so thoughtful of you.

13:17.315 --> 13:19.349
I like it hard, deep and no eye-contact.

13:24.272 --> 13:26.189
I just bought myself 90
minutes to watch this footage

13:26.240 --> 13:28.191
and edit out anything
Caroline doesn't need to see.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.277
Oh, you are Kick-ass Kaminski.

13:30.328 --> 13:31.495
Hell yeah, I am.

13:31.529 --> 13:34.114
Owwie! Toe cramp! Toe cramp!

13:37.168 --> 13:40.137
Hey, are you busy?

13:40.171 --> 13:42.205
Yeah, having a panic attack.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.125
Come on in and shut the door.

13:45.176 --> 13:49.463
Um, I was just calling to see if
there was anything else I could do

13:49.514 --> 13:53.133
before I throw myself off the balcony.

13:53.184 --> 13:55.552
Well, you actually might not have to.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.387
Look at the footage from the bedroom.

13:57.389 --> 13:58.388
The camera just focuses on the dresser.

13:58.439 --> 14:03.026
Oh, well, as long as it doesn't
focus on the un-dresser.

14:03.061 --> 14:04.277
Let's just fast forward from the top

14:04.312 --> 14:05.445
- and see what we got.
- Okay.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.165
Okay, that's us eating on the terrace.

14:08.199 --> 14:10.400
Roline wouldn't mind that.

14:10.451 --> 14:13.203
There's us drinking
and moving to the couch.

14:13.237 --> 14:15.072
She might mind that.

14:15.123 --> 14:18.075
There's my top flying
into the champagne bucket.

14:18.077 --> 14:20.510
She is so gonna mind that.

14:20.545 --> 14:23.296
Juju!

14:23.331 --> 14:26.216
Are you in here?

14:26.250 --> 14:29.419
Hey, I thought you were getting a massage.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.221
No, I couldn't relax.

14:31.255 --> 14:34.057
The Masseur was wearing
brown shoes and a black belt.

14:34.092 --> 14:36.393
What are you doing here?

14:36.427 --> 14:38.261
I...

14:38.312 --> 14:41.846
I thought I'd keep an eye on her
while I was going over the footage.

14:41.847 --> 14:42.949
Yeah.

14:43.134 --> 14:45.068
So smart, Juju.

14:45.703 --> 14:47.003
Let's play the tape.

14:48.038 --> 14:50.123
You know what? I already did.

14:50.174 --> 14:53.926
And I watched it from the
top, and no one stole anything.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.096
Except you with my heart.

14:58.766 --> 15:00.683
Aww, so sweet.

15:00.718 --> 15:04.053
- I want to see for myself.
- Caroline, no!

15:04.104 --> 15:05.855
Excuse me?

15:05.889 --> 15:07.890
Let me ask you a question:

15:07.941 --> 15:09.785
Do you love me?

15:09.786 --> 15:11.815
- More than anythin...
- Good!

15:11.816 --> 15:15.676
And I love you too, but if we're gonna
spend the rest of our lives together,

15:15.677 --> 15:17.369
you better start learning how to trust me.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.890
I watched the tape and
no one stole anything.

15:19.891 --> 15:21.184
- But...
- But nothing!

15:21.185 --> 15:23.348
End of discussion. Forget the damn tape!

15:24.708 --> 15:26.909
Juju.

15:26.911 --> 15:28.961
I've never seen you like this.

15:28.996 --> 15:33.633
You're so mean and demanding.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.669
I love it.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.022
You do?

15:39.056 --> 15:40.757
Yes.

15:40.759 --> 15:44.093
Good, 'cause there's more.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.679
Tell me, big boy.

15:46.730 --> 15:47.930
You're coming to dinner tonight!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.899
You're gonna meet those Chinese investors

15:49.933 --> 15:52.101
- and you are gonna love it!
- Damn right I am.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.936
God, I want you so bad right now.

16:01.045 --> 16:04.614
S-so is it like... is it cool if I go?

16:08.952 --> 16:10.787
- Hey.
- Hi, went to Chinatown

16:10.789 --> 16:11.936
and got the rest of the stuff you need.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.802
I also bought some illegal fireworks.

16:13.803 --> 16:16.663
Yeah yeah, uh-huh.

16:16.664 --> 16:18.740
That's what we need around
here, more fireworks!

16:18.741 --> 16:21.198
Man, I got to hustle.

16:21.199 --> 16:24.484
I'm in so over my head with
this dinner and everything!

16:26.971 --> 16:29.185
- What are you doing?
- Oh, to make it crispy

16:29.186 --> 16:31.279
you have to pump air between
the skin and the meat.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.013
Are you freaking kidding me?

16:34.014 --> 16:35.884
No no, I saw it on "Iron Chef".

16:35.885 --> 16:37.594
Oh, and a "Looney Tunes Cartoon".

16:39.817 --> 16:42.819
No I'm talking about this sweet view!

16:43.987 --> 16:46.089
Will you take a photo of me out here?

16:47.991 --> 16:49.992
Are you listening to me?

16:49.994 --> 16:52.128
Today has been the worst day ever.

16:52.162 --> 16:54.664
Elliot gave me this
impossible dinner to make.

16:54.715 --> 16:56.082
Caroline thinks I'm a thief.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.834
And I know I shouldn't
have a crush on my boss

16:57.836 --> 16:59.669
and I pretty much don't,
but then he defended me

16:59.720 --> 17:02.672
to his fiancee, and... oh!

17:03.841 --> 17:05.892
And then they started doing it on the desk.

17:09.046 --> 17:11.681
Damn it!

17:13.066 --> 17:14.901
Okay, don't cry.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.602
It's just a duck.

17:16.653 --> 17:18.654
Look how high we are.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.691
We can just reach out the
window and grab another one.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.992
Uh, Sofia, it's not just the duck.

17:25.864 --> 17:27.663
Five-second rule.

17:28.866 --> 17:30.867
Okay, I get that you're freaking out.

17:30.918 --> 17:34.704
Do you really? Because today
is just the first day, okay?

17:34.755 --> 17:37.189
What happens on the second
or the third, you know?!

17:37.190 --> 17:39.387
Tonight he's having guys here from China.

17:39.388 --> 17:41.804
And do you know how
many countries there are?

17:42.573 --> 17:46.565
And how many lies there are on my resume?

17:47.885 --> 17:50.853
Sofia, I can't do this job.

17:50.888 --> 17:52.722
That's not true.

17:52.773 --> 17:56.859
What you can't do is manage your money, get
your car to work, pick a decent boyfriend.

17:56.894 --> 17:58.978
Wait! This is the
opposite of cheering me up!

17:59.029 --> 18:00.730
Okay, not done yet!

18:00.781 --> 18:05.818
What you can do and what you do better than
anyone else I know is cook your ass off.

18:05.869 --> 18:09.655
My duck was on the floor.

18:15.045 --> 18:17.663
Good evening, everyone. For dinner tonight

18:17.714 --> 18:21.751
we have a whole catfish prepared
in the style of the Fujian Province.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.587
I hope you find it Fujian amazing.

18:27.091 --> 18:29.008
"Fujian amazing," that's good.

18:29.059 --> 18:33.930
I don't get it, but I'm
having a really good time.

18:35.832 --> 18:40.653
Okay, next, we have a dish I
like to call "Falling Duck"...

18:42.774 --> 18:45.658
With a spicy Szechuan Pickled Cabbage.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.662
Okay, tough crowd.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.949
And lastly, I figured you might
be kind of sick of Chinese food,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.951
or as you call it, "food."

18:57.087 --> 19:00.790
So I made my famous
Spaghetti and Meatballs.

19:05.629 --> 19:08.014
Thank God! I am sick of Chinese food.

19:08.048 --> 19:10.766
Seriously?

19:10.801 --> 19:12.935
Well, if you like this, then
you're gonna love dessert.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.971
Please say apple pie.

19:15.022 --> 19:16.973
Apple pie!

19:17.024 --> 19:19.058
Apple pie!

19:19.109 --> 19:20.810
They like it.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.648
Oh good, I caught you.

19:25.699 --> 19:28.618
The spaghetti and meatballs,
that was stroke of genius.

19:28.652 --> 19:31.887
Yeah, well, I almost
had a stroke making it.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.040
It completely changed the mood in there.

19:34.074 --> 19:36.455
I mean, they're finally talking about
something other than work.

19:36.456 --> 19:38.636
It turns out Mr. Lee's a scorpio.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.388
And how cute
was it when he and Mr. Wang

19:41.389 --> 19:43.553
ate my spaghetti "lady
and the tramp" style?

19:44.001 --> 19:45.718
Adorable.

19:47.087 --> 19:49.805
So we're good?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.058
Well, now, yeah.

19:52.092 --> 19:56.112
I mean, it was a pretty close call with
the ring and Caroline and that tape.

19:56.146 --> 19:59.849
And to be honest I wasn't sure if you
were gonna be able to pull off this dinner,

19:59.900 --> 20:02.018
but you did, like a rock star.

20:03.103 --> 20:04.687
I'm proud of you.

20:06.106 --> 20:08.658
Um, I meant am I good to go home?

20:14.326 --> 20:16.792
- Absolutely.
- Cool.

20:16.793 --> 20:18.989
- See you tomorrow, Chef.
- See you tomorrow, boss.

20:23.944 --> 20:26.268
I got this!

20:29.338 --> 20:30.723
Oh, the button.

20:35.691 --> 20:36.776
You're all here,

20:36.777 --> 20:39.287
because I found something on the
security footage that we should all see.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.074

20:59.920 --> 21:01.923
Marriage?

21:01.924 --> 21:05.499
Well, I hadn't thought
about it, but yes yes yes!

21:08.504 --> 21:11.969
I love you! I love you! I love you!

21:14.259 --> 21:15.989
We love you too, bud.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.490
I was talking to the ring.
