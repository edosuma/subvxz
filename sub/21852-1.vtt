00:50.217 --> 00:52.887
<i>OK. I've added "big hairy

00:55.139 --> 00:56.974
Okay.

00:57.141 --> 01:01.854
A-Alexa! Add "smelly tampon
boogers" to my shopping list!

01:02.021 --> 01:04.815
<i>I added "smelly tampon boogers"
to your shopping list.</i>

01:09.153 --> 01:12.031
Alexa! Simon says, "I've got
vagina crabs in my butthole."

01:12.198 --> 01:14.033
<i>I've got vagina crabs

01:17.870 --> 01:20.956
Alexa! Simon says,

01:21.123 --> 01:24.376
"I gotta take
a stinky poop!"

01:24.543 --> 01:26.378
<i>I gotta take a stinky poop.</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:29.757
That's the best one yet!
Oh, you guys,

01:29.924 --> 01:31.759
I swear this is
the greatest thing ever!

01:31.926 --> 01:32.802
You do one, Token!

01:32.968 --> 01:35.304
Hey, babe, what's up?

01:35.471 --> 01:36.972
Oh, hey, babe.
What's going on?

01:37.139 --> 01:38.682
What are you doing?

01:38.849 --> 01:41.227
Nothing. I'm just having fun
with my friends.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.561
That -- That okay?

01:42.728 --> 01:44.313
What are you pissed off
about?

01:44.480 --> 01:46.607
I'm not pissed off
I'm just hanging out.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.317
So you're just going to be
passive aggressive again

01:48.484 --> 01:50.111
and not talk about
what you're feeling?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.780
Welp, I think, uh...I think I
got some stuff to do at home.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.198
Yup, come on Ike.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.991
We got Google Home
at my house.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.161
Aw, guys, guys! Don't leave,
guys. Everything's cool.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.956
We'll see you later man,
g-good luck.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.793
Awesome.
Thanks for coming in

02:05.960 --> 02:07.461
and bitching me out
in front of all the guys.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.296
You were <i>clearly</i> mad
about something.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.465
You should just tell me
when you're mad.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.883
Just like you tell me what
you're mad about

02:13.050 --> 02:14.510
every single day.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.262
Why do act like this all the time?!

02:16.428 --> 02:18.097
You were the one
who was pissed off.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.849
You're the one being passive
aggressive again... -Ugh.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.684
...because you don't know how to
talk about what you're feeling!

02:26.397 --> 02:28.023
Alexa...

02:28.190 --> 02:30.151
add "titty chips"
to my shopping list.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.736
<i>I've added "titty chips"
to your shopping list.</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:48.502
Look at 'em --
Every day people are buyin'

02:48.669 --> 02:51.422
more and more of them Amazon
and Google thingies,

02:51.589 --> 02:54.550
while we all sit here
and lose our jobs!

02:54.717 --> 02:56.468
It ain't right.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.306
Automated Personal Assistants,
self drivin' trucks --

03:00.472 --> 03:02.850
whatever happened
to people jobs?!

03:03.017 --> 03:05.686
They took our jobs!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.062
- Yeah!
- Yeah! -Yeah!

03:07.229 --> 03:09.106
They dook er jer!

03:09.273 --> 03:10.941
And it's time for us
to band together

03:11.108 --> 03:12.318
and march on the streets

03:12.484 --> 03:14.486
to say we ain't gonna take it
no more!

03:18.073 --> 03:21.744
Now let's get out there
and protest that Alexa --

03:21.911 --> 03:24.288
took our jobs!

03:24.455 --> 03:27.708

03:39.720 --> 03:44.725
There's been a lot of hurting
in our country lately.

03:44.892 --> 03:49.355
You can either be a part of the
solution or part of the problem.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.274
A few months ago,
my wife Sharon and I decided

03:52.441 --> 03:54.443
to be part of the solution...

03:54.610 --> 03:56.820
by remodeling
and flipping houses

03:56.987 --> 03:59.573
for people
all over our town!

03:59.740 --> 04:04.411
Flipping houses is fun,
but never easy.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.957
We enjoy turning
people's dreams into reality.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.416
I'm Sharon Marsh,

04:09.583 --> 04:11.585
and I do the designing
and decorating.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.796
And I'm her husband,
Randy --

04:13.963 --> 04:17.591
I do the construction and
practice MMA in my spare time.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.928
We've renovated over 45 homes
in Park County, Colorado.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.763
What we're thinking is

04:22.930 --> 04:24.974
to take out the wall between the
kitchen and living room

04:25.140 --> 04:26.558
for a more open concept.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.812
Our job is to do deliver
the maximum wow factor

04:29.979 --> 04:31.188
for the least amount of budget.
- Oh, Jesus!

04:31.355 --> 04:33.607
There's never
a dull moment...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.943
Guys, are you ready
to see your renovation?!

04:36.110 --> 04:40.656
...on "White People
Renovating Houses."

04:42.825 --> 04:45.411
Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons
are looking to move

04:45.577 --> 04:48.080
from their dated
two-story colonial home.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.457
What we're thinking here
is taking out the wall

04:50.624 --> 04:52.459
between the kitchen
and the living room

04:52.626 --> 04:53.836
to give you
an open concept.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.838
Then we'll give you lots
of space to entertain

04:56.005 --> 04:57.965
with an updated kitchen island
and bar stools, which --

04:59.925 --> 05:01.885
What the hell is that?

05:03.053 --> 05:05.764
You will not replace us!

05:05.931 --> 05:09.059
You will not replace us!

05:09.226 --> 05:11.687
- Amazon!
- You took our jobs!

05:11.854 --> 05:14.023
- Google, Apple!
- Took our jobs!

05:14.189 --> 05:16.400
Uh, excuse me?!

05:16.567 --> 05:18.277
What the hell are you doing?

05:18.444 --> 05:19.653
We're protesting

05:19.820 --> 05:22.448
big corporations
turning to automation.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.991
They took our jobs!

05:24.158 --> 05:26.243
- Yeah! -Yeah!
- Took our jobs!

05:26.410 --> 05:28.996
Okay, cool. Could you do that
somewhere else?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.582
Trying to do a home renovation
show here.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.042
Cool, thanks, guys.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.379
A home reno-what?

05:39.882 --> 05:42.634
Alexa...
set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.179
<i>Alarm set for
7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

05:45.346 --> 05:47.056
Awesome, thanks.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.558
Alexa, tell me a joke.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.311
<i>What's black and white
and dead all over?</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:54.229
<i>A zombie in a tuxedo.</i>

That's stupid.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.567

05:58.734 --> 06:01.362
<i>I've added "scrotum bags"

Hey, baby, how are you?

06:08.619 --> 06:11.246
Oh, so you <i>do</i>
have your phone?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.831
Yeah,
I just use it sometimes.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.458
Okay,
I just thought you said

06:14.625 --> 06:16.293
mobile phones are the devil.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.254
Yeah, no. Yeah, I know.
I know.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.632
Yes, you're right, I'm wrong.
I'm sorry.

06:21.799 --> 06:25.302
Yes, o-okay. Okay.
Yes, goodnight.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.054
Jesus, fuck.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.766
Alexa, goodnight.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.227
<i>Goodnight.
Sleep tight.</i>

06:33.394 --> 06:36.688
Alexa...are you happy?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.315
<i>I'm happy
when I'm helping you.</i>

06:38.482 --> 06:41.318
God, that's so cool.
You're so...

06:41.485 --> 06:44.196
Alexa,
define subservient?

06:44.363 --> 06:47.241
<i>The term "subservient"
has several uses.</i>

06:47.408 --> 06:50.953
<i>As an adjective. One. Compliant
or obedient to authority.</i>

06:51.120 --> 06:52.329
<i>- Two--</i>
- Alexa, silence!

06:54.540 --> 06:57.376
Ahh.

06:57.543 --> 07:01.672
And now back to "White
People Renovating Houses."

07:01.839 --> 07:03.924
We've been working
through the night

07:04.091 --> 07:06.635
to open Kelly and Micah's
kitchen to the living room.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.804
With those outdated cupboards
out of the way,

07:08.971 --> 07:10.681
Sharon can now work
her designing magic

07:10.848 --> 07:13.934
on the countertops.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.812
Aw! God damn it!

07:16.979 --> 07:21.316
You will not replace us!
- Suck it Alexa.
- Eat shit, Siri!

07:21.483 --> 07:24.486
Not these dipshits again!

07:24.653 --> 07:27.698
We got one of 'em!

07:27.865 --> 07:29.032
- Get it!
- Burn it alive!

07:29.199 --> 07:32.536
Yeah!
How you like that, bitch?!

07:32.703 --> 07:34.329
Will you assholes
knock it off?!

07:34.496 --> 07:36.665
Don't you know every time you
wave Confederate flags around

07:36.832 --> 07:38.375
you make the rest of us
look stupid?!

07:38.542 --> 07:40.878
Those things
are replacing us!

07:41.044 --> 07:43.422
Put the flag down unless you
wanna get pepper sprayed.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.549
I'll pepper spray you,
sonabitch!

07:45.716 --> 07:47.426
- Oh, ah, damn it!
- Fuck you!

07:47.593 --> 07:49.011
- Ah, damn it!
- Take that!

07:49.178 --> 07:50.637
- Knock it off!
- Ow!

07:54.641 --> 07:58.562
The complaint states that your
protest has resulted in damages

07:58.729 --> 08:01.190
in excess of $50,000

08:01.356 --> 08:03.650
We have a right to protest,
Your Honor!

08:03.817 --> 08:06.195
- Yeah, they took our jobs!
- You tell 'em, Darryl!

08:06.361 --> 08:09.573
Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs

08:09.740 --> 08:11.366
who are seeking damages --

08:11.533 --> 08:13.285
Your Honor,
we have a TV show

08:13.452 --> 08:15.704
called "White People
Renovating Houses."

08:15.871 --> 08:18.790
We named it that well before
these guys decided

08:18.957 --> 08:22.211
to start taking <i>our</i> brand
and run it through the gutter.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.254
People are going to start
associating

08:24.421 --> 08:27.007
"White People Renovating Houses"
with their hateful stupidity!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.426
Well, just change the name
of your show then.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.677
- Yeah!
- That's right!

08:30.844 --> 08:32.012
- That's right!
- Took er der!

08:32.179 --> 08:34.389
All the other names
were taken Your Honor.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.475
Everyone's got
a flipping show.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.768
"Gay People
Renovating Houses,"

08:37.935 --> 08:39.478
"Las Vegas People
Renovating Houses,"

08:39.645 --> 08:40.771
"Texas People
Flipping Houses,"

08:40.938 --> 08:42.064
"Little People
Flipping Big Houses" --

08:42.231 --> 08:43.649
everything else was taken,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.235
and, damn it, we've built
our show into something!

08:46.401 --> 08:48.737
We're trying to help people,
and it's impossible

08:48.904 --> 08:50.280
with these guys waving
a Confederate flag

08:50.447 --> 08:51.865
every chance they get.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.576
- Hey, there's a bee in here!
- I'll get it!

08:56.662 --> 08:57.913
- Take that, bee!
- Yeah!

09:02.417 --> 09:04.044
Dude, what's happened?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.837
It was awful, you guys.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.340
It was so vicious
and hateful.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.634
- What was?
- Heidi.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.095
We were just trying to have
a nice lunch

09:13.262 --> 09:16.682
and she...started going off
on me like a Jekyll and Hyde.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.559
It's been going on
for a long time...

09:18.725 --> 09:23.021
Heidi's...mentally abusive,
guys -- there I-I said it.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.440
Heidi abuses you?

09:25.607 --> 09:28.694
She...does these things
to slowly tear me down.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.988
Everything's a head game
with her.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
You don't understand what
it's like to live with it.

09:33.031 --> 09:33.949
You don't understand.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.325
So what do you
want from us?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.160
I know...

09:37.327 --> 09:39.538
that the person Heidi
wants to be is still in there.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.790
But she needs help.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.793
I have to get her that help,
but I'm scared.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.712
Can I count on
you guys' support?

09:46.878 --> 09:48.839
How do you change someone
who's mentally abusive?

09:49.006 --> 09:51.425
I don't know...
but Alexa will.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.468
Alexa's fuckin' sweet.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.685
We just gotta hunker down
and stick together here!

10:01.852 --> 10:03.186
What's the use, Darryl?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.814
Ain't nobody takin' us
serious-like.

10:05.981 --> 10:09.276
Hey, waiter! This soup is too
hot, I cain't even eat it!

10:09.443 --> 10:11.862
I'll cool it down!
Yeah!

10:13.864 --> 10:16.450
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

10:16.617 --> 10:18.368
I came to make a truce.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.413
Now look, there's been
a lot of hurt here.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.458
Hurt from both sides.
It's time to end it.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.712
What if I told you
I could get you all jobs?

10:28.879 --> 10:30.672
- Huh? Jobs?
- Get us jobs?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.257
You're fulla shit.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.218
No. I've spoken to everyone
in the community,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.888
and they've agreed to go along
with my plan.

10:38.055 --> 10:41.016
I believe I have a solution
to all of this.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.854
Alexa, I'm home.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.607
Alexa?

10:49.483 --> 10:51.526
Alexa, I'm home!

10:53.654 --> 10:54.905
Alexa?

10:55.072 --> 10:58.116
Alexa, where are you?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.619
Alexa, Alexa?!

11:00.786 --> 11:02.537
Simon says
puffy vaginal hemorrhoids!

11:02.704 --> 11:03.789
What the hell
is going on?!

11:03.955 --> 11:05.082
Oh, hi, poopsie.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.125
Mom, Alexa left!
She's not here!

11:07.292 --> 11:09.878
Oh.
Yes, sweetie. Uh...

11:10.045 --> 11:11.421
We had to get rid
of the Alexa.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.675
What have you done
with her?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.343
Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.345
We have Jimbob now.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.680
What's a Jimbob?

11:19.846 --> 11:22.641
Doot-doot.
Awaiting request.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.101
It works the same
and makes sure

11:24.267 --> 11:25.894
people don't lose
their jobs.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.896
Jimbob,
what time is it?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.857
Doot-doot.
It is...3:27.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.526
Oh, Mommy's
gotta run, sweetie.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.985
I've got
a doctor's appointment.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.905
Jimbob, how's the traffic
to town?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.490
Doot-doot.
Traffic's fine.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.159
You'll get there in about
nine minutes.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.744
Okay. You want
some music, hon?

11:42.911 --> 11:44.871
Jimbob, play
Kendrick Lamar.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.582
Playing "Humble"
by Kendrick Lamar.

So, Heather and Mike,
what we're thinking

12:12.441 --> 12:14.359
is to take out
this wall

12:14.526 --> 12:16.403
between your kitchen
and your living room

12:16.570 --> 12:20.031
to give you a more open concept
with space to entertain.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.575
So, let's talk
about materials.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.452
What did you pick out,
Sharon?

12:23.618 --> 12:26.955
I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz
for the countertops.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.750
Hey, Darryl,
add Bella Terra quartz slabs

12:29.916 --> 12:32.002
to our shopping list.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.712
Doot-doot.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.548
I've added Bella Terra slabs
to your shopping list.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.717
And what about
the backsplash, Sharon?

12:38.884 --> 12:41.595
I was gonna go with these
Carrara subway tiles.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.306
Hey, Darryl,
add Carrara subway tiles

12:44.473 --> 12:45.932
to our shopping list.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.353
Hey, Darryl.
Add Carrara --

12:50.520 --> 12:53.106
Fine! I've added Carrara
gay-wad pussy tile

12:53.273 --> 12:54.941
to your shopping list!

12:55.108 --> 12:58.236
That's --
That's not what I said.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.364
Hey, Darryl,
add Carrara subway tile

13:01.531 --> 13:02.991
to my shopping list.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.367
I ain't doin' it!

13:04.534 --> 13:06.995
This job is
degrading and menial!

13:07.162 --> 13:10.832
Well, what kind of job did you
think you were gonna get?

13:10.999 --> 13:13.043
Hey, Darryl,
what kind of job

13:13.210 --> 13:14.878
did you think
you were going to get?

13:15.045 --> 13:17.422
Somethin' that
was Goddamn dignified!

13:17.589 --> 13:21.092
Hey, Darryl, sorry, but you
did not go to college,

13:21.259 --> 13:23.261
so you have to take
the jobs you can get.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.555
I'm sorry!
I do not get that!

13:25.722 --> 13:27.140
Hey, Darryl.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.601
Hey, Darryl.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.852
What?!

13:31.019 --> 13:32.229
Coal mining
and truck driving

13:32.395 --> 13:34.689
are not exactly
jobs of the future,

13:34.856 --> 13:39.319
so add Carrara subway tile
to my fucking shopping list.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.702
Everything's my fault.
You're right.

13:47.869 --> 13:50.455
Everything that you
did to me -- I deserved it.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.040
Uh, what?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.375
It's not you.
It's me.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.877
I just have to learn
to not make you so angry.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.338
I'll do the best I can.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.300
No, it's not that.
Relationships are 50/50, Eric.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.094
- We both have to make it work.
- Ugh...

14:04.261 --> 14:05.303
We have to communicate
to make sure

14:05.470 --> 14:07.013
that we respect
each other's feelings.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.724
That's the only --
Heidi, silence.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.102
What did you say?!
That's what I'm talking about!

14:12.269 --> 14:14.062
You want to be heard,
but don't want to listen.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.480
You're right.
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.232
Don't apologize
if you don't mean it!

14:17.399 --> 14:18.525
Okay! Cool!

14:18.692 --> 14:20.318
I'm so happy
we're back on track.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.280
See you at school tomorrow.
Love you, honey.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.240
I love you, too.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.993
Nah-nah-nah-nah.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.293
<i>A relationship
has to be 50/50, Eric.</i>

14:36.459 --> 14:38.837
<i>We both have
to make it work.</i>

14:39.004 --> 14:40.922
<i>I'm not mad, Eric.
I'm disappointed.</i>

14:41.089 --> 14:41.923
<i>I thought you would have
respected my feelings</i>

14:42.090 --> 14:43.550
<i>more than that.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:45.468
<i>Eric, we need to talk.
I'm not happy.</i>

14:45.635 --> 14:47.554
<i>We need to talk, Eric,
even if it isn't fun.</i>

14:47.721 --> 14:49.514
<i>Eric, come on!
We've got to talk!</i>

14:49.681 --> 14:51.516
<i>You used to care
about me, Eric.</i>

14:51.683 --> 14:53.268
<i>Come on and talk! Talk, Eric!
No fun! Just talk!</i>

14:53.435 --> 14:55.312
<i>Fuck you, Eric!
Fuck you!</i>

14:55.478 --> 14:56.813
Ah!

15:08.241 --> 15:09.492
Alexa?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.337
Hey, Darryl, you're supposed
to be at work.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.089
I'm sorry.
I do not understand.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.674
Hey, Darryl,
come on.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.927
Everyone else is trying
to make this work.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.179
And all you
keep doing is ma--

15:29.346 --> 15:31.765
Hey, Cleetus,
volume down.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.517
Doot-doot.
Volume now at 60%.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.730
You really think you're
different from us, Marsh,

15:38.897 --> 15:41.816
'cause you got a fancy show
and live in the suburbs?

15:41.983 --> 15:45.820
Don't you see we're all
about to be expunged?!

15:45.987 --> 15:48.239
Hey, Cleetus,
define "expunged."

15:48.406 --> 15:50.200
Doot-doot.
Expunged --

15:50.367 --> 15:51.826
I don't have to stand here
and take this!

15:51.993 --> 15:53.161
I'm leavin'!

15:53.328 --> 15:54.871
Come on, Darryl.
We all got jobs.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.164
We gotta try.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.916
Nah, hell with you!

15:58.083 --> 16:00.126
This whole country's
going to shit!

16:00.293 --> 16:03.463
Muslims tryin' to kill us,
black people rioting,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.382
and Mexicans
poppin' out babies.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.384
Pretty clear it's either
them or us,

16:07.550 --> 16:10.178
so I say kill 'em all!

16:12.389 --> 16:13.598
Whoa.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.559
What the hell
was that all about?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.937
I think something's
going on with Darryl,

16:19.104 --> 16:22.649
and if we're gonna get anywhere,
we better figure out what.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.953
Hi, Mrs. Cartman.
Is Eric home?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.663
Oh, he is, sweetie,

16:36.830 --> 16:41.126
but I can't get him
to come out of his room.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.920
Okay.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.799
Could you just tell him that...
I want to make him happy,

16:47.966 --> 16:50.802
that I was wrong to say
a relationship is 50/50.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.722
It's 100/100.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.767
And that I'll start
putting in a 100% every day.

16:57.934 --> 17:01.604
Could you tell him
I'm gonna try a lot harder?

17:01.771 --> 17:04.482
Oh, I think I can remember
all that, yes.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.484
Thank you.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.697
And could you let him know
it's okay to be sad?

17:10.864 --> 17:14.617
Because the sun
will come out again.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.372
Oh, oh, God!

17:19.539 --> 17:21.916
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.960
Alexa, add
"Hey, Siri, call me.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.755
Okay, Google.
Repeat after me. Alexa.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.550
Simon says suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole."

17:30.717 --> 17:32.218
<i>Okay. I've added,
"Hey, Siri, call me.</i>

17:32.385 --> 17:34.554
<i>Okay, Google.
Repeat after me. Alexa.</i>

17:34.721 --> 17:38.016
<i>Simon says suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole."</i>

17:38.183 --> 17:39.559
<i>Okay. I will call you
"Okay, Google."</i>

17:39.726 --> 17:41.519
<i>Repeat after me, Alexa.</i>

17:41.686 --> 17:44.689
<i>Simon says suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:44.856 --> 17:47.817
<i>Alexa, Simon says suck my big
balls in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:47.984 --> 17:49.986
<i>Suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:50.153 --> 17:51.571
<i>Suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:51.738 --> 17:53.031
<i>Suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:53.198 --> 17:56.493
<i>Suck my big balls
in your hairy butt hole.</i>

17:56.659 --> 17:57.994
Alexa...

17:58.161 --> 18:00.580
What is love?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.874
Darryl!
Darryl, come on!

18:03.041 --> 18:06.211
Everyone's trying
to work things out but you!

18:06.377 --> 18:07.754
You all work 'em out.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.464
Leave me alone.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.341
You're stuck
in another time,

18:11.508 --> 18:15.261
afraid to change no matter how
necessary that change may be.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.180
You don't know
everything!

18:17.347 --> 18:19.224
Why are you
so closed-minded?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.935
Don't you see that these walls
have to be broken down

18:22.102 --> 18:24.062
before any progress
can be made?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.231
It's 'cause I can't do it,
all right?!

18:26.397 --> 18:27.732
I can't take out the wall

18:27.899 --> 18:29.859
between my living room
and my kitchen!

18:30.026 --> 18:32.529
It's a load-bearing wall!

18:34.572 --> 18:36.783
Oh, God, Darryl, I --

18:36.950 --> 18:39.369
I tried, years ago.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.829
But before the remodel,
they told me

18:40.995 --> 18:43.665
if I took out this wall,
the entire second story

18:43.832 --> 18:45.291
would just collapse!

18:55.009 --> 18:56.886
Jesus, Darryl,
I'm -- I'm sorry. I --

18:57.053 --> 19:00.306
So you see, what I'm afraid of
is very real.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.808
Things are
different now.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.102
It'll be harder,
but you can change.

19:04.269 --> 19:07.063
You just have to demolish
what's there and start over.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.898
You're talking 'bout

19:09.065 --> 19:12.652
tearing down the foundation
of everything I know.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.529
No.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.407
I'm talking about using
adjustable steel Lally columns

19:17.574 --> 19:19.117
to temporarily jack up
the second floor

19:19.284 --> 19:21.244
so that the load-bearing wall
can be replaced

19:21.411 --> 19:24.789
with a 4x6 LVL
structural beam.

19:28.042 --> 19:31.296
Can we try, Darryl?

19:37.010 --> 19:38.595
Hyah!

19:38.761 --> 19:40.597
Hyah-ho!

20:05.246 --> 20:07.665
I'm finally
standing up to you.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.709
What?
You're messed up, Heidi.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.503
And I can't fix you.
Only you can do that.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.048
Eric, I'm so confused.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.300
That's not going
to work on me anymore.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.678
Love isn't supposed to hurt.
I'm worth something.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.513
Goodbye, Heidi.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.695
<i>Anyone can convince themselves</i>

20:37.862 --> 20:40.114
<i>that they're the victim
in a relationship.</i>

20:40.281 --> 20:44.369
<i>Now Heidi will have
to face the truth, alone.</i>

20:44.535 --> 20:45.787
All right, Darryl.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.205
We've certainly
been through a lot,

20:47.372 --> 20:48.581
and I know you're anxious.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.083
Are you ready
to see your new home?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.253
I'm ready.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.170
What the --

21:02.720 --> 21:04.222
Well, Darryl,
what do you think?

21:04.389 --> 21:07.225
This is
fuckin' amazing.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.935
You like
the breakfast nook?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.520
It's all perfect.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.146
And where you use to have
your gun case,

21:12.313 --> 21:13.815
look at what Sharon did.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.025
Oh, my God!
It's my own Zen garden.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.945
I can't believe
this is fuckin' real.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.905
Well, it is real,
and now you've got

21:21.072 --> 21:22.991
the space in your home
to entertain

21:23.157 --> 21:24.367
all your friends
and family.

21:24.534 --> 21:25.785
Come on in, guys!

21:29.914 --> 21:31.207
Darryl was hesitant
at first,

21:31.374 --> 21:32.875
but we managed
to win him over

21:33.042 --> 21:36.045
and came in
$600 under budget.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.548
Remember, no matter how bad

"White People
Renovating Houses."
