00:36.836 --> 00:38.827
What the?

00:41.508 --> 00:44.534
"Mmm, Princess Bubblegum,
we are starving.

00:44.611 --> 00:47.375
Immediately send us
all of your candy.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.608
How dare you.
Ours, Lemongrabs."

00:49.682 --> 00:53.675
Bullgunk! I left them a lifetime
supply of candy!

00:55.822 --> 00:58.450
Hey, Finn! Hey, Jake!
Can you come up here?

00:58.525 --> 01:00.857
I have a job for you!
- Okay!

01:00.927 --> 01:05.591
Sorry, CB, we'll finish
this up later.

01:05.665 --> 01:06.893
Hey, "Preebs."

01:06.966 --> 01:09.833
Hey, guys, I got a letter from
the Earls of Lemongrab.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.394
They've gone through all the
food that I've sent them.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.770
This case contains precious
candy seeds

01:14.841 --> 01:18.743
for the Lemongrabs
to grow new food.

01:18.812 --> 01:22.805
So, I need you two to deliver
these seeds to Lemon Castle.

01:22.882 --> 01:23.814
For sure, we'll do it.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.113
Good luck,
gentlemen!

01:26.186 --> 01:28.086
Hup!

01:30.623 --> 01:33.023
Bye, girlfriend!

01:43.336 --> 01:45.361
Hey, Lemongrabs!
You home?

01:45.438 --> 01:48.202
Holy!

01:51.911 --> 01:53.538
Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake!

01:53.613 --> 01:57.447
Oh, gross! No!

01:57.517 --> 01:58.609
Kiss it!

01:58.685 --> 02:00.846
Aah!

02:00.920 --> 02:02.512
Sorry, dudes, we got no food.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.954
No food.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.354
Hey!

02:05.425 --> 02:07.120
Uh!

02:07.193 --> 02:08.922
Hey! Weirdos!

02:08.995 --> 02:10.461
Get the birthday cake!

02:18.805 --> 02:19.999
Are you lemon?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.370
Whoa!

02:21.441 --> 02:23.568
What the thing is up
with this guy?

02:23.643 --> 02:26.203
Does your head come
to a nub?

02:26.279 --> 02:27.143
What?

02:27.213 --> 02:29.374
You are un-lemon.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.609
Yeah. Cool, man.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.048
Hey, do you know wh-

02:32.118 --> 02:33.585
I am Lemonjon.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.145
I see you made it past our
lemon... mmm...

02:37.223 --> 02:38.747
"mmer-ringue-gerie."

02:38.825 --> 02:39.917
Wait. What?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.654
They're quite hungry.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.525
Yeah, what the heck's
going on here?

02:43.596 --> 02:46.656
There is no food...
only lemons.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.826
Lemons with bellies empty

02:48.902 --> 02:51.700
but for their lemon lusts.

02:51.771 --> 02:52.931
Whatever, Lemonjon.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.997
We've got to give those dumb
butts these seeds.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.371
Where should we go?

02:56.442 --> 02:58.433
Mmmmmmmmm...

02:58.511 --> 03:02.572
My senses tell me
that they're in the dungeon.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.914
They've been there
for three weeks.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.384
Three weeks, dungeon.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.182
I wonder who put them
in there?

03:09.255 --> 03:11.746
I don't know, but we
gotta bust them out!

03:11.824 --> 03:13.553
Which way to the dungeon,
Lemonjon?

03:16.095 --> 03:17.926
- Oh, cool.
- Thanks, man!

03:17.997 --> 03:20.465
Yeah, thanks, man!

03:29.142 --> 03:29.972
Hmm!

03:47.560 --> 03:49.357
Hmm.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.898
Yo, lemonwipes!

03:54.834 --> 03:56.825
Euch.

04:00.006 --> 04:03.999
Uh, maybe we should hold
hands... for safety.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.376
Yeah, sure.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.142
So, where do you want
to look ne...

04:09.215 --> 04:10.113
Nyah!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.447
Uh, Finn?!

04:13.519 --> 04:16.886
Oh, sorry, dude!

04:16.956 --> 04:18.821
Stay close to me.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.635
Nope!

04:32.372 --> 04:34.499
Aah!

04:35.508 --> 04:37.533
I think this is it.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.339
All locked up.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.642
There they are!
Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here!

04:41.714 --> 04:43.705
We're gonna get you out!
Just hold tight!

04:43.783 --> 04:46.115
Go away. No food here.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.450
Maybe the kidnapper's
in there, too, coercing them.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.990
It's probably the grossest
one of all, too...

04:52.058 --> 04:53.889
beet-red skin, barf,

04:53.960 --> 04:56.451
poopin' all its junk-sculpture.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.997
Ugh, stop it.
You're just makin' it worse.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.329
Let's just get this
over with.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.926
Lemongrabs,
you are free!

05:04.003 --> 05:05.630
They broke the door!

05:05.705 --> 05:07.332
The door is broken now!

05:07.407 --> 05:09.204
Fix the door!

05:09.275 --> 05:11.368
Fix the door?
What? What?

05:11.444 --> 05:13.173
Fix the door? Fix? What?

05:13.246 --> 05:14.770
What's going on here?

05:14.847 --> 05:16.007
"Fix the door?"

05:16.082 --> 05:17.674
Finn, what's going on?

05:17.750 --> 05:18.910
"Fix the door?"

05:18.985 --> 05:20.680
It doesn't matter anymore.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.983
There is no more candy
to hoard.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.354
Let them keep
what crumbs they find.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.884
For there are no crumbs.

05:28.961 --> 05:33.591
♪♪ Noo crummbbss! ♪♪

05:33.666 --> 05:35.691
Are you saying you locked
yourselves down here

05:35.768 --> 05:37.736
with all the food so you could
eat it yourselves?

05:37.804 --> 05:39.897
You know there's guys
starvin' up there?!

05:39.972 --> 05:43.169
Mm, no, no.
You do not understand.

05:43.242 --> 05:46.439
It is not us for whom
they starve, but them.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.503
For whom they starve.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.276
Mm, yes, yes.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.444
For the candy food
was not consumed.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.044
No, no. But was given life.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.521
Wha?

05:57.590 --> 06:00.525
You see, Finn...

06:00.593 --> 06:03.687
when mother-princess last
visited Lemongrab...

06:03.763 --> 06:06.960
When she saw fit to create me...
Lemongrab...

06:07.033 --> 06:10.366
She left behind a little
something-something...

06:10.436 --> 06:14.532
the secret formula
for creating candy life.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.905
She must've meant
for us to have it

06:16.976 --> 06:19.274
to keep making more family.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.143
Yes, yes, all her fault.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.206
What? What'd you say?

06:24.283 --> 06:25.648
I said all her fault.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.776
Oh! Indeed!

06:26.853 --> 06:30.050
For once we had commenced,
how could we desist?

06:30.123 --> 06:32.114
I looked deep in myself

06:32.191 --> 06:34.853
and found that I'm a guy
who can't stop

06:34.927 --> 06:39.455
making candy life
from the food he needs.

06:39.532 --> 06:40.726
Me too.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.291
It just felt so pretty okay
inside,

06:43.369 --> 06:45.769
greeting each new placid
face...

06:45.838 --> 06:49.638
And hearing each new
piercing song.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.278
We used the last of the food
to make "Plop-Top" here.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.782
Hmm. I thought we said
"Dump-Dome."

06:57.850 --> 06:59.977
Who cares anyway?!

07:00.052 --> 07:03.078
They've brought no food!
We're all going to die!

07:03.156 --> 07:05.590
Look, we brought these
seeds.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.523
They're special candy seeds.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.561
You can grow new food now.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.291
Oh, yes.
Mmm, mm-hmm.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.390
Mm-hmm, yes. Ooh.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.901
Yes, yes. There we go!

07:18.571 --> 07:22.166
We'll call you "Seed-Wad."

07:22.241 --> 07:23.208
Ooh.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.937
You really <i>are</i> gonna die.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.638
And all your boys, too.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.339
Our boys?

07:28.414 --> 07:31.008
Come on, we'll take you
to see Princess Bubblegum.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.880
She knows more about candy
than anyone.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.079
She built a whole kingdom
out of candy.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.883
Yes, okay.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.719
For our boys.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.089
But first we will notify
the children

07:41.160 --> 07:43.651
of our impending
departure.

07:43.729 --> 07:46.061
So they won't worry about us

07:46.132 --> 07:49.465
while we're away.

07:49.535 --> 07:53.335
Okay, yes, the hard times
are over.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.608
Here's the plan.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.440
We will go
to the Candy Kingdom

07:59.512 --> 08:02.140
and take all their
candy from them.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.979
Then we will give that candy
precious life

08:05.051 --> 08:07.110
and build a candy army

08:07.186 --> 08:11.748
so we may then go forth and
pillage candy for all to eat!

08:14.160 --> 08:17.960
- Now go, young Lemonjon!
- Go! Go!

08:19.332 --> 08:22.563
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

08:22.635 --> 08:24.865
What's going on,
Lemongrabs?!

08:24.937 --> 08:27.872
- It's all your fault!
- All your fault!

08:27.940 --> 08:29.771
We warned you!

08:29.842 --> 08:33.208
We warned you about us!

08:42.221 --> 08:44.382
Aaaaah!

08:45.892 --> 08:47.519
What the?

08:47.593 --> 08:49.823
Whoooooa!

08:54.467 --> 08:56.765
Jake, are you all right?

08:56.836 --> 08:59.100
Yeah, but look!

08:59.171 --> 09:01.139
He's heading right
for the Candy Kingdom!

09:02.441 --> 09:04.068
And he's too big
to duke it out with.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.610
Unless...

09:05.678 --> 09:07.612
Giant poison candy
aspirin.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.410
I've got this one,
but it might be too small.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.145
No. We'll kick him in his heart
'til he's history.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.414
Those must've been Lemonjon's
guts we saw before.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.149
His heart is his weak spot.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.623
Yeah, but we'll never
find it again in time.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.058
Unless that's it there
with the juice comin' out.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.720
Remember all that juice?
From before?

09:23.796 --> 09:27.163
Oh, yeah, that's
probably it.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.292
Whoa!

09:29.368 --> 09:30.596
Oh, man!

09:32.271 --> 09:33.602
Tastes like vitamins.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.135
Are you sure
this is it?

09:37.209 --> 09:38.335
It's not even doing anything.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.641
Just smash it already,
Grandma.

09:40.713 --> 09:41.737
Right.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.686
Oh, nice one, Jake.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.157
Whoa. Hold the phone.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.558
What is this powerful
new juice

09:56.629 --> 09:59.996
coursing fromst
my core source?

10:00.066 --> 10:03.797
Arrrrrgh!
The juice aches!

10:03.869 --> 10:07.896
Is this the rumored ache
of feeling?

10:07.974 --> 10:11.933
The feeling of caring
unknown to lemons?

10:12.011 --> 10:14.275
New thoughts emerge...

10:14.347 --> 10:18.078
If I act, the candy people
will suffer...

10:18.150 --> 10:21.813
If I don't, the lemon people
will suffer.

10:21.887 --> 10:25.618
The greater good demands
but one course only...

10:25.691 --> 10:28.888
that I dissolve the bonds
uniting me

10:28.961 --> 10:32.362
and become component
to all!

10:37.536 --> 10:38.730
Oh, dang.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.034
He turned himself all up
into lemon candy.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.508
Man, that Lemonjon's
all right.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.138
And... there we go.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.681
All done.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.512
The last trace
of the candy-life formula

10:51.584 --> 10:53.552
is out of their heads.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.213
And I snatched this out
the lemon castle, "boyee!"

10:56.288 --> 10:59.655
Now we all just have to keep
a closer eye on these two

10:59.725 --> 11:01.818
so they don't get into
any more trouble.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.885
But how come we don't
just fix their hearts

11:03.963 --> 11:05.863
like we did with Lemonjon

11:05.931 --> 11:07.592
so they're more selfless
and less selfish?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.931
Oh, no, no.
Their hearts are fine.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.028
- They're just like this.
- Mm.
