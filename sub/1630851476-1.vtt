01:37.720 --> 01:39.840
What happened?
Nothing.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.280
No, tell me what happened.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.720
No, it was nothing.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.280
It was just some shit
with some Lebo dogs.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.960
Yeah, did you start it?

01:48.280 --> 01:49.560
No, I didn't start it.

Oh what, you can't take a joke,
fellas? Come on.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.160
They were pretty sick rhymes,

02:10.240 --> 02:12.760
but, ah, you gotta give me
credit for that.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.400
Hey, LC!

02:15.480 --> 02:16.640
Little Crazy.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.840
What's happening, man?
What's goin' on, my brother?

02:19.920 --> 02:22.120
Nothing.
Oh, yeah?

02:22.200 --> 02:25.400
I hear your cousins were making
some calls from Supermax.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.120
How'd he get that phone in there,
mate?

02:27.200 --> 02:29.000
Someone sneak it up their arse,
or what?

02:29.080 --> 02:30.440
That phone must stink.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.000
I would not be putting
that thing near my face.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.880
Someone got a charger in there too,
huh? Huh?

02:36.960 --> 02:39.000
You're talkin' shit, brother.

Hey, whaddya bein' a prick for?
I was just mucking around.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.720
Just show me some respect, bro.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.040
I'm a 'Ndrangheta.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.720
What's that?

02:46.800 --> 02:47.960
Calabrian old school.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.360
Goes way back to the old days.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.480
Never heard of it.
Yeah?

02:51.560 --> 02:54.400
'Cause you're a dumb Arab.
You don't know shit.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.720
If you knew anything,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.040
you'd put respect

03:00.480 --> 03:03.840

03:03.920 --> 03:06.720
Why you so upset, bro?
I was just muckin' around.

Get outta my face,
you little mutt.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.720

Hey, guess what?
When I get outta here,

03:45.920 --> 03:47.920
I'm gonna fuck your missus
in the arse.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.360
My missus?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.640
Watch your mouth.
You're dead!

Yeah, you little rat dog, huh?

03:55.840 --> 03:57.520
Oh!

03:57.600 --> 04:00.720
You just signed
your own death warrant, you dog.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.760
But where are the kids?
They're at kindy?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.960
Yeah. Yeah, and then there's dramas
with Maria.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.880
Why? What's up?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.960
She's been biting kids.
It's happened a few times.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.720
Why is she biting?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.600
I don't know, but we've gotta go see
the teacher, Mrs Kimble.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.920
She's not happy.
When?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.280
Now.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
How come?

05:24.440 --> 05:26.240
Because we've gotta pick up
the kids.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.040
I thought we were gonna go home
and have a root.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.560
We just had one.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.640
Yeah, but I meant
like a proper one.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.520
What was the last one,
not good enough?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.840
Oh, I don't know,
maybe I feel like another one.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.560
You're a greedy root pig.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.880
How'd you make bail, by the way?

05:43.920 --> 05:45.280
Oh, good behaviour.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.520
Oh yeah, was this before
or after the fight?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.000
I hear you've been in the wars,
Pasquale?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.160
Yeah, no, sweet as.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.280
Have a seat, mate.
Yeah.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.480
So, we hear you might
have some information for us.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.240
That depends, mate, that depends.
What kind of info youse after?

06:10.320 --> 06:12.080
You're not gonna waste
our time again, are you?

06:12.160 --> 06:14.000
Ah, come on, I'm just muckin' around.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.360
I've got something for youse
for sure,

06:15.440 --> 06:18.720
but first, I want something,
you know what I mean?

06:18.800 --> 06:20.560
It doesn't work like that, Pat.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.600
You of all people should know that.
I want bail.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.960
If I'm gonna give you something,

06:25.040 --> 06:26.880
I wanna know what guarantees
youse are gonna give me.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.320
None.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.080
That's bullshit.
Forget it.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.320
OK, Pat. If you've got nothing
to give us, we'll get going.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.120
Oh, alright, alright, alright,
alright, alright, you pricks.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.680
I've got some guns.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.920
Guns?
What kind of guns?

06:41.480 --> 06:42.640
Big guns.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.400
Maria's a very sweet little girl,
but she's excitable.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.560
She gets over-emotional at times.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.920
It's probably due to the fact

07:19.000 --> 07:21.040
her speech
hasn't quite fully developed.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.440
She gets frustrated, yeah?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.200
And it's in those times
that she's sometimes lashing out,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.360
and it's coming in the form
of bites.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.560
What kind of bites?
Like little nips?

07:31.640 --> 07:32.720
Well, no.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.360
There's been one or two
quite serious bites

07:34.440 --> 07:37.160
where she's broken through
the skin and left nasty bruises.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.480
But she's only little.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.440
She probably doesn't even know
what she's doing.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.040
Yeah, I appreciate that,
but in the interests of safety

07:43.120 --> 07:44.440
of the other children,

07:44.520 --> 07:45.640
I'm afraid if it doesn't stop,

07:45.720 --> 07:47.160
we're going to have to ask her
to leave.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.720
It's the law.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.720
Maria!

07:51.800 --> 07:53.040
It's your daddy!

07:53.120 --> 07:54.280
Come here, darling.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.240
It's OK, it's daddy.
Daddy's home.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.840
Hello, my beautiful girl.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.160
Oh, my god, I've missed you so much.

I don't know, heaps.

What colour were they?

Brown, maybe.

Does he?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.320
I'd kiss the frogs.

What for?
They could turn into a prince.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.960
I've eaten frogs.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.200
You can eat their legs.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.640
Eww, I don't wanna eat frogs!

09:02.720 --> 09:03.680
Nah, nah, they're good.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.320
They taste like,
ah, like chicken wings.

would be awesome.

He's' got his bail hearing
in a few days.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.480
He's not gonna get bail.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.360
What'd you say to him to get
so pissed off with you, brother?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.840
Said I was gonna root his missus
in the arse.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.320
You'd better hope
he doesn't get bail, mate,

12:10.400 --> 12:11.600
I'm telling you.
I couldn't give a shit.

Here.

in Sydney right there, mate.

The best view?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
How can you say that?
How can you not, mate?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.320
That's a world-class view.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.680
What do you mean?
It's an alright view.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.240
There's plenty
of other good views around here.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.600
You can't say
that this is the best one.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.720
Yes, you bloody can, man.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.240
Look, New Year's Eve,
here, the fireworks.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.040
There's no other place to be
in the whole city, mate.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.480
Look at it.
That's no bullshit. You serious?

12:35.560 --> 12:37.640
What about the Toaster building?
It's too close, man.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.720
I've been there New Years Eve, mate.
You can't see anything.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.080
You can't see nothing.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.520
It's like you're sitting
too close to the TV.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.000
You sound up yourself.
"This is the best view!"

12:44.080 --> 12:45.760
Can you stop being a dickhead?
You sound like a poofter.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.960
Stop being a dickhead, man.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.120
Hey, you know what
that is out there?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.640
Look at it. Money.
What are you talking about?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.040
That's billions of dollars locked
up in bricks and mortar, mate.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.680
Right there, mate.
That's where the real money is.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.720
Building, mate.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.000
The big players in this town, mate,
they run that game.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.640
Why do you think
I'm getting into building, mate?

12:58.720 --> 13:00.640
Who's richer, drug dealers
or property developers?

13:00.720 --> 13:01.840
Think about it.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.520
Yeah, alright, I'll take it.
What?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.680
This apartment, right here.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.040
The second it's finished,
I'm movin' in.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.400
You just said
you don't like the view.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.120
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I've been
thinkin' these things a lot lately.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.920
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.560
Goin' places, movin' up.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.280
Bruv, I'm free.
I'm outta jail.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.440
I've got connections.
I've got a heap of cash.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.600
I'm not thinkin' small-time anymore.
Do you think it's that easy?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.280
I'm not gonna be some shitkicker,
I'm gonna be a boss.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.480
Do you think it's that easy,
brother?

13:24.560 --> 13:25.600
Listen to me, brother.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.600
You wanna be something,
you wanna be somewhere in this world,

13:27.680 --> 13:29.680
you want something, you gotta go
out there and you gotta take it.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.040
It's what's called positive speaking.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.880
It's called speaking
out of your arse.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.000
Shut up, you idiot.
Hey, I'm movin' up, seriously.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.200
Hey, get in here.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.440
What are you doin'?
Takin' a photo.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.760
I don't take selfies.
Shut up, shut up.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.000
One for me, please.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.160
You never actually own the car.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.360
What's that mean?

13:45.440 --> 13:47.720
Well, the title's not in your name.
You don't own it.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.000
Who owns it?

13:49.080 --> 13:50.200
Some company in Dubai.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.520
It's all untraceable.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.400
Your name only appears
on the insurance as the driver.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.960
But look, mate, bottom line,
you pay cash for the car,

13:57.040 --> 13:58.800
they transfer ownership
to the company,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.040
then you get to drive it.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.200
You wanna sell it,
you just bring it back.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.040
They give you back your money,
minus a bit of depreciation.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.560
The original cash is washed

14:07.640 --> 14:09.640
and you've been driving a Lambo
this whole time.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.200
What's not to like, mate?

14:17.320 --> 14:18.600
You wanna take it for a spin?

14:18.680 --> 14:19.760
Yeah.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.640
Always known I was gonna be a boss,

15:03.720 --> 15:05.080
ever since I was a kid,
I knew it.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.800
And not like all the old-timers
in Griffith.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.240
They were just a bunch of wankers,
mate.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.440
Proper dinosaurs, you know,
of the round ones and these ones

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
and those ones.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.160
They were old school
but it was always with the gear

15:13.240 --> 15:15.080
and da-da-da-da-da.
They thought they were the bomb

15:15.160 --> 15:16.640
but really,
they were just a bunch of wankers.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.680
Anyway, that's why
I had the dust-up with 'em.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.880
You know, they started sellin'
the pingers and that bullshit,

15:20.960 --> 15:22.360
so I thought I'd give it a crack.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.720
I did it way better than 'em.

15:23.800 --> 15:24.800
Better gear, cheaper.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.920
Suddenly I'm doin' good,
next thing you know they're like,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.960
"Hey, this is our spot,"
you know what I mean?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.080
Anyway, I told the lot of 'em,

15:30.160 --> 15:33.160
"Go fuck yourselves. Piss off,
you bunch of wankers," you know.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.720
Sydney's where the real cash is.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.800
It's big-time shit here.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.560
Hey, I've got a Lambo,
I've got a place with the best view

15:38.640 --> 15:40.680
in the whole city,
I've got a hot wife.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.840
I'm going places,
you know what I mean?

15:42.920 --> 15:45.080
Heard about Little Crazy?
He got bail.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.840
When?
Couple of days ago.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.400
Who gives a shit, eh?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.920
Well, he's gunnin' for you.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.560
Who told you that?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.960
Apparently you said something vulgar
about his missus.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.320
Yeah, so what if I did?
Who gives a shit?

15:56.400 --> 15:57.520
What, you not worried?

15:58.360 --> 16:00.920
Nah.
Nah, I couldn't give a shit.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.360
Yeah?

16:05.440 --> 16:08.440
Mate, he was talkin' shit
about my missus, I told you.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.720
Brother, he said he
was gonna stick it

16:10.800 --> 16:12.480
in her arse.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.080
Yeah.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.800
All the boys heard it,
every single one of 'em.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.400
All the boys were there.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.760
Alright, fine.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.600
You know, he's dead.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.520
Unless he gives me 300K.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.040
If he give me 300K, you know,

16:25.120 --> 16:26.360
I'll forget about the insult.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.800
He doesn't give me 300K,
I'm gonna put two in his head.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.040
Yalla, bye.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.640
He fucking, you never talk shit
about another bloke's missus,

16:35.720 --> 16:36.720
you know what I mean?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.280
That's like, that's an area
you do not cross.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
Yeah.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.920
And I'm gonna fuckin' kill you
once you cross it,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.720
'cause it says there's barbed wire.
It's got the X. It's got the skull.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.760
Do not enter.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.080
He fuckin' entered,
and now he's fuckin' dead,

16:47.160 --> 16:48.920
you hear what I mean?
Like I might kill him, mate.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.720
It's easy for me.
Like one, two, pup-pup,

16:50.800 --> 16:52.520
you know what I mean, two bullets,
like all I need is two,

16:52.600 --> 16:54.240
all I need is two, all I need
is fuckin' one bullet, cuz.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.160
One bullet through the heart,
pierce him through the heart.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.160
Yalla, drive to Maccas,
get me a Big Mac.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.600
300K?

17:00.680 --> 17:01.720
What, is he off his head, mate?

17:01.800 --> 17:04.440
That's your problem, mate.
He's completely insane.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.360
Why would he think
I'm gonna pay him 300,000.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.640
Mate, to be perfectly honest,

17:07.720 --> 17:09.200
I don't even think
he wants the 300K.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.000
I reckon he just wants to knock you,

17:11.080 --> 17:12.800
and he's just come up
with a number

17:12.880 --> 17:14.360
that makes him feel good
about not doing it.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.880
You're talking shit.
Does it make sense to you?

17:15.960 --> 17:17.160
What he's trying to say,
you dumbarse,

17:17.240 --> 17:18.360
is if you don't pay up, you're dead.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.720
You think I'm scared
of that little prick?

17:19.800 --> 17:20.760
Well, you should be, man.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.440
You said you were going to root
his wife in the arse.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.520
Yeah, what about it?

17:23.600 --> 17:25.440
These blokes knock people
for making fun of their haircuts.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.680
You said you're gonna have anal
with his wife?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.040
What do you think?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.120
I pay that little prick,

17:32.200 --> 17:33.640
everyone in Sydney's
gonna stand over me.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.760
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.040
Unless I knock him first.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.280
Oh, yeah? Mate, you wouldn't be able
to knock a disabled Nanna,

17:39.360 --> 17:41.240
let alone a psychopath
like Little Crazy, mate.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.360
Yeah, yeah?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.840
How would you like a smack
in the head, huh?

17:43.920 --> 17:45.160
Hey, hey,
now you're getting personal.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.760
Take it easy.
We're on the same side.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.440
Hey listen,
we got a plan all worked out.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
Yeah, what?

17:49.600 --> 17:52.880
Farhad Qaumi.
They call him the Afghan.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.240
He's the head
of the Blacktown chapter of BFL.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.520
Well, what about him?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.200
Well there's shit goin' down
with the Brothers.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.480
Their top dog, Bassam Hamzy,
he's in Supermax

18:00.560 --> 18:03.720
and just got 15 years added
to his sentence, so he's gone.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.320
Yeah, I reckon
they're goin' tits up.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.360
Why?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.960
Well, half the brothers
hate the other half.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.040
So how does that help me?

18:09.120 --> 18:10.520
Well, you get in with The Afghan.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.160
He's a powerful bloke in Blacktown.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.160
Runs the whole show
and the best thing is,

18:14.240 --> 18:15.560
he hates Little Crazy.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.680
It could be good to get in with him,
you know what I mean?

18:17.760 --> 18:18.720
He's majorly cashed up.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.200
Good for all of us,
you know what I'm saying?

18:20.280 --> 18:21.480
Hey, man, awesome party.
Thanks a lot.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.120
No, no, seriously, though, thank you
so much for bringing us down here.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.440
We were just gonna have
a quiet party...

18:26.520 --> 18:27.960
Piss off, would you?
We're talkin'.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.400
This Afghan bloke. Hey!
What do I do about him?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.120
I'll try and set up a meeting.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.280
You go in, you have a chat,
you try and get into his good books.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.600
What do you reckon?

18:39.480 --> 18:40.920
Yeah, what's he s'posed to be like?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.480
Well, he's a very scary bloke.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.040
All the crims in Sydney
are shittin' themselves over him.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.600
But that doesn't matter, right?

18:46.680 --> 18:48.240
He might just save your life.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.120
And two more, come on.
Two more.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.240
I'm not doin' it for you.
Let's go. Drop your traps.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.360
Posture. Nice. Let's go,
one more. One more. All you.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.360
All you.
Nice, you're almost there.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.040
And nice.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.200
Look at the difference.
Look at the difference.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.960
Come and have a look at why those
last two reps are so important.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.520
(INDISTINCT).

19:15.600 --> 19:17.160
Yeah, just rotate
towards that a little bit.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.480
Nice.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.880
That.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.080
Yeah, I look fuckin' hectic, boy.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.080
I'm gonna post that.
Please like it.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.080
Priorities, mate.
You're pumped. Let's go.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.960
Holy shit, look at that chick.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.560
Ah, Zina.
What, you know her?

19:35.640 --> 19:37.440
Every day, mate, she's in here.
Bullshit.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.720
Furniture.
Look at those tits.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.880
Top-quality fakes, mate. Expensive.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.520
Oh yeah, that's an incredible
rack of tits, though.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.680
Yeah.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.120
Hey, hey, hey, one second.
What?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.400
One second. Just one second.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.800
See you.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.800
Hey.
How's it goin'?

19:58.520 --> 19:59.920
I'm OK.
You're Zina?

20:00.000 --> 20:00.960
Yes.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.960
My mate over there, Mohey,
he works here. Told me your name.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.200
Oh.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
So you come here a bit, right?

20:05.360 --> 20:06.960
I mean, you look like you,
you like to work out.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.720
Like, you look good.
Like toned.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.800
Thanks.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.440
Nah, nah, seriously,
your body is amazing.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.960
Can I ask you something?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.560
do you do anything like
a special diet or anything like that?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.160
No, I don't have a special diet.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.200
You serious?

20:20.280 --> 20:24.320
Well I mean, I avoid sugar,
and salt and gluten,

20:24.400 --> 20:26.720
processed carbs, and dairy.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.120
Oh, and I take amino, protein,
probiotics, Omega-3s,

20:30.200 --> 20:33.200
and you know, the usual supplements
like calcium, magnesium,

20:33.280 --> 20:36.040
turmeric, flaxseed oil,
zinc, B-supplements.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.440
Oh, and I drink kombucha.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.280
But other than that,
I don't do anything.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.120
And what do you do for a job?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.600
You must be like a model
or something.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.760
I'm a dancer.
Well, shit, no wonder.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.640
That's why your body's so hot.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.880
Hey, wanna know something?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.640
There's plenty
of smoking hot dancers out there,

20:54.720 --> 20:57.040
but I reckon probably for sure

20:57.120 --> 20:58.600
you're pretty much hotter
than any of them,

20:58.680 --> 21:00.880
and the reason is
because you have like a,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.200
like a model's face.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.160
Like you could be a model easily.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.520
I don't think I could.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.080
Nah, nah, nah, no bullshitting.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.080
Your face is almost as pretty
as Miranda Kerr's.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.120
And your body's probably hotter.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.520
Oh, my god.
I mean...

21:15.600 --> 21:17.480
You look like
you work out a lot, too.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.360
Yeah, yeah, every day.
I love to stay in shape.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.040
I think the most important thing
in life is looking good.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.160
'Cause if you look like shit
you may as well be dead.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.240
You know what I mean?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.720
Yeah.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.000
Hey, I'm, ah, Pat.
Pasquale. Pasquale.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.400
Hey. Pasquale?
Yeah, yeah, it's Italian.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.560
I'm Italian.

21:37.640 --> 21:41.040
Oh, my god, what a small world.
I'm from Croatia originally.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.720
Yeah, right.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.200
Oh, so both of those countries
are in Europe.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.280
Yeah.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.200
So, ah, can I get your number?

21:51.280 --> 21:52.560
I'll take you out somewhere.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.000
I'll take you somewhere really nice.
What do you reckon?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.520
How do I know you're not
a serial killer or something, hm?

21:57.600 --> 22:00.600
Me?
Do I look like a serial killer?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.760
Pull up alongside.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.000
What's goin' on, brother?
Mahmoud, how are you?

22:16.080 --> 22:17.360
Chu.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.560
So Yehya, how's your mum and dad?

22:19.640 --> 22:20.920
She's a bit sick at the moment.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.960
I think it's just a cold.
Yeah?

22:23.040 --> 22:24.120
Salamtik.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.960
So I wanna know what you boys
are thinking.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.120
About what, mate?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.880
Don't talk shit.
You know what.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.160
Relax, bra,
I'm just jokin' with you.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.160
You wanna know who's runnin' things
with the Brothers?

22:35.240 --> 22:36.320
Yeah.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.320
You boys know it should be me,
you know, I've been good to you.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.920
Very good.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.640
So I wanna know
if I've got your loyalty.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.560
How about you clear
something up with me first?

22:44.640 --> 22:46.400
Something I heard about.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.800
What's that?

22:49.520 --> 22:51.120
That you tried to bang my missus.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.280
What?

22:53.360 --> 22:54.640
Who said that, brother?

22:54.720 --> 22:57.200
Doesn't matter who said it.
Did you try to bang her?

22:57.280 --> 22:59.640
No way.
Why would I wanna bang your missus?

22:59.720 --> 23:02.160
She's the last chick on earth
I'd try to bang.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.960
Are you saying she's ugly
or something?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
What?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.360
Did you just say my wife is ugly?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.520
Get this guy a tissue, bro.
He's gonna start crying.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.000
Do you wanna start
something with me?

23:12.080 --> 23:14.600
I'm just askin' you, if you just
said that my wife is ugly.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.280
Yeah, she's ugly.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.320
What about it?

23:18.400 --> 23:19.760
Well then your wife's a slut.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.360
What?

23:23.440 --> 23:24.960
You just said my wife's ugly, bra.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.280
You said my missus was a slut?

23:27.360 --> 23:29.680
Listen, bra, you tried
to bang my missus

23:29.760 --> 23:31.160
and then you bullshit about it,

23:31.240 --> 23:33.000
saying that she's ugly
and you don't wanna bang her.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.320
Well, guess what?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.240
Your wife's a gold digger
and a slut.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.640
How about that?

23:37.720 --> 23:40.600
Say it again.
I dare you.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.760
Say it again, one more time.
You got balls, you say it again.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.160
Can't believe this guy, mate.
Go for it.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.600
Bruz, can we just cool it?

23:45.680 --> 23:48.640
Nobody said anything about
anyone's wife being ugly or sluts.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.880
We're here to talk about leadership
for the chapters.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.440
Come on, we're together, aren't we?

23:54.320 --> 23:55.600
Say it again.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.240
Your wife's a gold-digger
and (FOREIGN LANGUAGE),

23:59.320 --> 24:00.680
what are you gonna do about it?

24:01.600 --> 24:05.000
How's this for a (FOREIGN LANGUAGE)?

24:05.880 --> 24:07.840
How's that for (FOREIGN LANGUAGE)?

24:07.920 --> 24:09.480
He said (FOREIGN LANGUAGE), yeah?

24:09.560 --> 24:11.440
He said he had a gun.
You heard it, yeah?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.040
You heard it, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bro.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.080
Yeah, yeah, drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.800
What do you think about the Lambo?
Pretty sick, eh?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.680
I don't know. I mean, these seats
are a bit hard, you know?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.960
It's a fuckin' racing car,
not a lounge chair, you spastic.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.440
I'm just saying, mate.
With all this money,

24:32.520 --> 24:34.160
you think they'd be
a little bit more comfortable,

24:34.240 --> 24:35.200
you know what I mean?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.440
why do you gotta be
such a dickhead?

24:36.520 --> 24:37.760
Hey, look, look, look, look!
Hey!

24:37.840 --> 24:38.800
Hey!
Check it out.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.040
Hey!
Hey! How's it goin'?

24:40.120 --> 24:42.000
Come here!
The one on the left, she wants me.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.040
Shut up.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.520
I mean, look at her!
She wants me.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.800
Shut up.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.000
Hey!

24:47.680 --> 24:49.400
I mean, you see all those cranes?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.760
See all those big cranes
up the top there, man?

24:52.800 --> 24:54.400
that's where the real money is,
man.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.680
That's where
you need to be thinking.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.640
If you say you wanna step up,
that where you need to be thinking.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.800
What do you mean?
Construction.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.120
Shitloads of it, man.
Those cranes.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.720
How much do you
think they're pulling in?

25:01.800 --> 25:02.880
What are you talkin' about?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.240
I got a mine, he's selling
a whole bunch of cranes.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.560
You can pay cash for it, too.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.440
How much?
About eight mill.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.200
8 million bucks?
Yeah.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.720
Can you come up with two?

25:15.720 --> 25:18.840
Take me a few months, but...
What about the rest?

25:18.920 --> 25:20.040
Well, we're gonna need a partner.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.960
Someone who's got a bit
of a cash problem.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.200
Like who?
Like BFL.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.000
Mate, they're moving that much gear,

25:26.080 --> 25:27.560
they gotta be cashed up
to the eyeballs.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.400
That's why you need to know
this Afghan bloke,

25:29.480 --> 25:30.480
you know what I'm saying?

25:44.160 --> 25:45.400
Let's go.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.600
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

25:54.680 --> 25:56.480
What the fuck you doin', man?

25:56.560 --> 25:57.880
What have I done?

26:01.680 --> 26:02.800
You know who I am?

26:02.880 --> 26:04.920
Yeah, you're Farhad Qaumi,
The Afghan.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.240
I know who you are,

26:06.320 --> 26:07.720
but I haven't done anything wrong,
mate.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.960
You hear about Bassam Hamzy?

26:09.040 --> 26:10.360
No, what happened?

26:10.440 --> 26:11.960
He made me the leader.
I'm the boss now.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.200
OK, cool.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.080
Bankstown Brothers For Life.
It's closed down now.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.160
There's no more Bankstown chapter.
Alright.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.160
Everyone over there has to come over
to Blacktown, yeah?

26:19.240 --> 26:21.160
Alright, sweet.
I have no problem with that, man.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.480
I thought the other two chapters
were bullshit, anyway.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.800
Tell your guys, alright?

26:26.880 --> 26:29.280
Yeah, I will.
I will, I promise.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.200
I, I will let them know.

Hey, so that Darling Point place,
it'll be ready in about two months.

26:43.240 --> 26:44.760
But we gotta work out
if we're gonna take our stuff

26:44.840 --> 26:46.120
from the home
or we're gonna get new stuff.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.760
I haven't even seen the place yet.
What do you mean,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.160
it's the best place
to watch the fireworks.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.520
I don't give a shit
about fireworks, Pas.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
I give a shit about all my friends.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.800
I don't know anyone
in Darling Point.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.400
Your friends could come hang out.
They'll love it.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.960
Oh, what about my coffee shop?
You know, my gym, my waxing place?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.080
It's Darling Point.
There's waxing places there.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.240
Chicks get their pubes done too.
How would you know?

27:04.480 --> 27:06.000
You can't get the yoghurt
with the sugar in it.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.880
But Giovanni likes that one.
It's bad for you.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.360
Giovanni likes it
'cause it's got sugar in it.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.440
Get the other one.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.520
God, it's hard enough to get him
to eat anything at the moment, Pas.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.400
You're gonna get him fat.
You try feeding him.

Pretty soon I'm gonna move us
somewhere like Point Piper,

some big business deals going on.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.120
Why are you sayin' it like that?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.960
Because I'm worried.
About what?

27:42.040 --> 27:44.440
About the fact
you just got out of jail.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.880
Yeah, what about the court case?
What are you going to do about that?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.840

to shit on my dreams?

to support me on that.

then the child shall be removed
from the facility."

29:10.280 --> 29:11.560
Can I see that, please?

29:11.640 --> 29:12.960
What you trying to say?

29:14.760 --> 29:18.440
It means we're going to have to ask
Maria to leave the school.

29:18.520 --> 29:22.200
What? What are you talking about?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.280
You can reapply
to have her reinstated

29:24.360 --> 29:25.920
but we have to be assured
the behaviour

29:26.000 --> 29:26.960
is not going to continue.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.600
No, hang on. Reapply? Why?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.400
Well, her place will be filled
by the next child

29:30.480 --> 29:31.600
on the waiting list.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.280
Does that mean we go to the end
of the waiting list?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.520
Yes, I'm afraid so.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.640
But it would take a year
to get her back in.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.800
It's bullshit!
No, Pas, stop, I'm sorry.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.120
No, Mrs Kimble, there has to be
something we can do here.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.720
I'm sorry, no.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.480
Once a complaint
has been registered,

29:45.560 --> 29:47.160
then we have no choice.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.880
Who made the complaint?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.480
I can't give out that information.
Come on, tell us!

29:51.560 --> 29:53.640
Who made the complaint?
Can't we just sort it out with them?

29:53.720 --> 29:54.880
I can't say.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.480
It's covered under
Federal Privacy legislation.

29:56.560 --> 29:57.800
If I was to give you
that information,

29:57.880 --> 29:59.480
I'd be breaking the law.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.160
Look, I'm sorry.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.720
Maria's a very sweet child.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.960
But once a complaint has been made,

30:05.040 --> 30:07.880
under our guidelines,
my hands are tied.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.200
Thank you.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.160
That's bullshit.
Let's go.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.240
Hey, Maria, which was the kid
that got bitten?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.440
Which one was it?

30:22.520 --> 30:24.360
No, you're not in trouble,
you're not in trouble.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.480
I'll give you a big piece
of chocolate, how's that?

30:26.560 --> 30:27.800
Just tell me which one.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.600
Sophie got bitten.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.640
Can we get out of here, please?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.840
One second.
What are you doing?

30:39.280 --> 30:41.480
Wait, one second.
What for?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.320
There.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.440
Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

30:49.520 --> 30:51.120
I'm sorting this out.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.360
Sorting this out? Pas!

30:52.440 --> 30:53.800
Hey, bubba. Hey, bubba.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.920
I'm sorting this out.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.440
Are you out of your mind?
Chill out, would you?

30:56.520 --> 30:57.920
Would you stop the car?
Chill out, would you?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.560
Stop the car right now.
Stop it.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.760
Shut up!
(TEXT MESSAGE PHONE CHIME)

31:00.840 --> 31:02.320
Stop it! Maria, you OK?
Yeah.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.400
Shit!
What?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.200
My meeting!
Would you just watch the road?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.760
Shut up!
You're doin' my head in!

31:06.840 --> 31:08.160
Pas, watch the road!
I wanna sort this out.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.400
Shut up!

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
Where is he?

31:11.760 --> 31:14.360
I dunno.
He's supposed to be here.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.240
No, no, no, don't, no, no, no,
don't you dare!

31:24.320 --> 31:25.280
I'll just be a minute.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.760
No, no, don't you dare move,
dickhead.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.880
You stay in the car.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.400
I mean it. Stay.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.920
Hi, I'm Melinda Barbaro.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.920
Excuse me, hi.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.680
Look, I'm so sorry to bother you.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.560
I'm Maria's mum.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.560
Maria's the little girl
who bit your daughter.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.000
Oh, yes?
What are you doing here?

31:42.080 --> 31:43.720
How did you,
how do you know where we live?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.160
Yeah, look, I'm so sorry.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.120
I know this seems kind
of weird right now...

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
Kind of?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.600
Yeah look,
I just wanted to talk about

31:49.680 --> 31:51.120
what happened at the school.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.920
I'm so sorry about the bite.
I feel terrible.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.560
Oh, I'm sure you do.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.920
Yeah, I just wanted to ask maybe
if you'd maybe change your mind

31:57.000 --> 31:58.320
about the complaint?

31:58.400 --> 32:00.280
They've told us
that she has to leave the kindy.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.080
(TEXT MESSAGE PHONE CHIME)
Shit.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.520
I'm very sorry but do you know
how badly she hurt my daughter?

32:04.600 --> 32:06.680
Stay here, baby girl.
OK, Dad!

32:06.760 --> 32:07.880
One second.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.120
She broke the skin,
and there's severe bruises.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.520
I had to take her to the doctor.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.720
I'll pay for that if you like.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.800
That's not the point.
Your daughter's dangerous.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.440
The school's right
to ask her to leave.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.760
You can't have a kid in there
that's hurting other kids.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.960
Oi! Come here.
Come with me.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.840
Pas.
I'm gonna call the police.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.120
You call the cops,
I'll shove that phone up your arse.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.040
Listen, brother, we're standing
outside your house, right?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.560
That means I know where you live.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.120
Get what I'm saying?

32:34.200 --> 32:36.400
I need you to drop that complaint
against my daughter.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.960
You're gonna call
the school tomorrow,

32:38.040 --> 32:39.840
you're gonna tell 'em
it was a big mistake, OK?

32:39.920 --> 32:41.640
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna come back here

32:41.720 --> 32:43.000
and I'm gonna break both your legs.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.600
You call the cops,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.120
(PHONE TEXT MESSAGE CHIME)

32:46.200 --> 32:47.680
Do you get what I'm saying?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.720
Yep.
Hello?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.240
Now I've got this expensive bottle
of wine for you and the missus.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.640
Do you like red?

32:53.720 --> 32:54.920
Yeah, we drink red.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.560
Good.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.600
Call the kindy.
Sort it out, OK?

32:59.680 --> 33:00.960
Yeah.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.800
This is kinda awkward.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.400
Mrs Kimble just called.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.680
Apparently it was a little boy
named Daniel who did the biting.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.400
She just caught him
doing it to another kid.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.320
What?

33:12.400 --> 33:15.000
Yeah, apparently
Maria didn't bite anyone.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.920
So sorry.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.240
Taking the piss.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.040
Sorry.
Get in the car.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.240
Get in the car.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.720
Get in the car.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.200
If I could ring
your fuckin' neck.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.680
Shut up and get in the car.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.000
Alright, I gotta go.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.320
Hey, hey.
Good luck with your meeting.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.320
Thanks.
Hey.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.200
I love you.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.720
Love you too.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.000
Alright, I'll be back.
Alright.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.040
Wish me luck.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.760
What are you gonna do to me?

34:16.280 --> 34:17.760
Where are we going?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.240
Someone you gotta meet.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.120
Hey, ah, you seen some blokes?

34:48.200 --> 34:50.280
Some Middle Eastern lookin' blokes?

34:50.360 --> 34:53.080
Ah, yeah.
They left just a few minutes ago.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.440
Shit!

35:07.200 --> 35:08.480
Shit.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.240
Hey! Hey!
How are you? I'm Barbaro.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.320
My mates call me Pat.
You're Farhad Qaumi? The Afghan?

35:25.400 --> 35:26.600
That's you, right?

35:26.680 --> 35:27.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I heard a lot about you.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.240
We're going.
Hey, yeah, wait.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.520
I got caught up. I got caught up.
One of my kids, they were at kindy.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.240
There was this bullshit.
They were biting each other.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.120
It was this whole thing.
Hey, can we go back inside, please?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.320
We've got a lot to talk about.
Please.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.360
No, no, I've gotta go.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.760
No, no, hey, please, please, wait
a second,

35:38.840 --> 35:40.360
brother.
Brother, brother, please.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.560
I got big dramas with Bankstown
at the moment. I need you.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.320
Who? What's that?
That Little Crazy bullshit.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.920
He reckons I owe I'm 300K.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.440
Yeah, what about it?

35:48.520 --> 35:51.000
Mate, I'm in remand with the guy,
I'm just joking around.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.360
Next thing you know
he cracks the shits

35:52.440 --> 35:54.560
and he picks a fight with me.
And I thought maybe you know...

35:54.640 --> 35:56.120
I don't give a shit
about Little Crazy.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.000
He's a prick.
I don't give a shit about him.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.600
That's what I reckon, too.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.160
Hey, I reckon he's an absolute prick.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.400
I swear.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.160
Hey, one second, one second.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.200
Thank you, brother.
Thank you, sir.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.480
Appreciate it, man. Easy.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.800
Hey, listen...
This your car?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.960
Yeah.
Do you like it?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.640
Seriously?
Yeah.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.320
Hey, listen, brother,
it's a nice car.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.600
It goes hard.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.840
Hey, if you wanna take it
for a drive, here, take the keys.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.440
You don't even
need to bring it back, whenever.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.280
Just take the key. Easy. Go.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.040
Hey, my mate,
he can get you one of these.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.120
Easily.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.760
He's got a mad deal goin' with 'em.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.680
I can get you one of these, bro.
No problem.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.360
Thanks.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.520
Easy.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.960
Yeah, bring it back whenever.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.680
What is that?
Is that a cucumber of a vibrator?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.160
Again.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.960
I bought a dildo
exactly like that

37:17.040 --> 37:18.720
for one of the lowies
back in the day.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.520
No, we'll show him the other one
with the swan.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.200
The swan.
You'll love this one, brother.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.000
You'll love this one.
The guy falls in the lake.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.080
Watch it, watch it.
Chuck it on, chuck it on.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.280
Watch it, watch it, watch it, ready?

37:36.720 --> 37:38.240
Brother, if that goose
has got balls,

37:38.320 --> 37:39.280
he'll go you one on one.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.640
It's a swan, bro.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.920
How's it goin', boys?

38:23.640 --> 38:24.600
If you gonna open your mouth,

38:24.680 --> 38:26.240
you'd better step up
to the plate there, brother.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
Yeah.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.840
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.200
What's happening, fellas?

38:34.280 --> 38:35.960
They missed him.
What?

38:36.040 --> 38:37.280
Little Crazy. He got away.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.760
Who gives a shit, eh?

38:39.840 --> 38:41.240
Better watch your back, bro.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.520
He's gonna come after all of us.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.200
Yeah, I'm not worried about
that little prick.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.280
You should be.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.640
This Little Crazy, mate,
he doesn't care.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.600
Killed his own mate.
Who?

38:48.680 --> 38:50.960
His mate, Yehya,
a couple of weeks ago.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.800
Little Crazy's out
with his cousin, Mahmoud.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.600
They get into an argument
with Yehya.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.280
LC just shoots him in the neck,
brother. Dead.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.560
Know what I mean, bro?

38:59.640 --> 39:01.800
You're goin' out,
you take The Shadow with you, yeah?

39:04.360 --> 39:07.720
Yeah, OK, no worries.
But hey, listen, I got you something.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.920
New clothes.
What for?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.160
So you look fresh, bro.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.120
These are designer labels.
They're expensive as shit.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.440
That one there, Versace.
Look at it.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.720
This one here, Armani.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.280
Not the Emporio, neither.
That's the proper Armani shit.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.520
Try 'em on.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.280
I got you something else, too.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.360
Got you some jeans.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.600
Diesel.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.400
Huh?
They're cool as shit.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.440
Pop 'em on, pop 'em on.
Hurry up.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.280
Look at that, bro.
Are you serious?

39:41.360 --> 39:42.720
You look so much better.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.600
That look,
it suits you completely, bro.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.720
Look.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.160
But, do you wanna know something?

39:48.240 --> 39:49.680
Don't take this the wrong way.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.440
You gotta lose the beard.
What?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.200
You gotta shave it off, bro.
What's wrong with it?

39:54.280 --> 39:55.960
I'm serious,
it looks like a terrorist beard.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.520
You can't be looking like that,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.760
not with everything we're doing.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.840
It does attract attention, bro.
What?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.840
Been meaning
to say something for a while.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.920
Maybe it's better you did get rid
of that beard, hm?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.280
Shave it, yeah?
What about you? What do you reckon?

40:20.520 --> 40:24.040
The reason I want you to look good
is 'cause you're gonna be a boss.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.920
I mean, a big-time boss, my brother.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.240
Yeah?

40:27.320 --> 40:30.640
My mate, Les, right?
He's in construction, properties.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.720
He's got places all around Sydney.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.920
Yeah, there's heaps
of money in construction.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.520
Nah, nah, nah, heaps, brother, heaps.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.520
Why do you think
all the big-time guys are doing it?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.760
Yeah, my mate, he does scaffolding
for painting houses.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.080
He makes heaps of money.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.000
Yeah, now picture your mate
in scaffolding for houses,

40:45.080 --> 40:47.800
but instead of houses,
they're huge skyscrapers.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.240
And instead of scaffolding,
it's cranes.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.920
Cranes?
Yeah.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.680
Listen, brother,
all the construction sites

40:53.760 --> 40:55.560
around Sydney you see,
every single one,

40:55.640 --> 40:56.800
dotted with cranes.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.560
Every single one of them cranes
is makin' money.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.960
Shitloads.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.400
My mate, Les, knows a bloke
selling a bunch of cranes.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.800
I don't know anything
about that shit.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.560
You don't need to know about it.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.920
Youse are making plenty of cash
out here, yeah?

41:10.000 --> 41:14.080
You've got what, maybe ten drivers,
more? Yeah? Shit, OK.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.160
So you know what it's like
to have cash piling up.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.600
Can't put it in the bank, can you?

41:17.680 --> 41:20.520
You can't buy a house.
Crime Commission will seize it.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.080
See, the best thing about the cranes,

41:22.160 --> 41:24.640
you can pay for the whole thing
in cash.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.880
They put your name on the thing,
all the money you make back is legit.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.120
Proper legit.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.240
Seriously, listen.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.840
I know youse are doin' well out here.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.560
And a year from now, you and me,

41:33.640 --> 41:36.000
we can practically
be running this entire city.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.840
This is how you step up.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.400
Know what I'm saying?

41:39.480 --> 41:40.680
Yeah.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.680
Want a kebab?

41:44.520 --> 41:46.160
Yeah, what kind are they?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.400
C is chicken, M is meat.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.360
Can I get a snack pack?

41:52.440 --> 41:53.720
Yeah, sure.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.160
Cheers, bro.

41:58.120 --> 42:01.280
Hey, look at that.
You look good.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.640
That's totally changed
the way you look.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.880
You do look better
without the beard, bro.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.040
Look at that. Hey, it's changed
the whole shape of your face.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.600
I'm telling you, brother.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.720
We're gonna be the bosses, yeah?

42:12.800 --> 42:14.120
We're gonna run this city.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.640
What do you think about that?

42:20.705 --> 42:21.760
Good evening.
I'm Angela Cox.

42:21.760 --> 42:25.400
Up to ten shots ring out last night
before a car speeding away.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.800
This morning associates
of the two men

42:27.880 --> 42:29.760
arrived at the crime scene.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.880
What can you tell us about
what happened here overnight?

42:31.960 --> 42:33.480
Just a bit of fireworks.

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
Fireworks?

42:34.640 --> 42:36.320
New Year's Eve came early.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.920
It is believed
that the people involved here...

42:38.000 --> 42:39.040
Bloody idiots.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.960
..links to the notorious
Brothers For Life crime gang.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.240
Pas?

42:46.960 --> 42:48.760
Where are you going?
Out.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.480
Obviously. Where?

42:50.560 --> 42:52.040
To dinner.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.360
I've got a big business meeting
in the city.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.960
What do you think,
for the kitchen in Darling Point?

42:58.040 --> 42:59.720
You wanna paint it yellow?

42:59.800 --> 43:01.600
Well, it's not yellow,
it's buttermilk.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.680
What's wrong with the colour
that's already there?

43:03.760 --> 43:05.320
I hate it.
It's revolting.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.320
What do you mean? It's juicy red.
I think that colour's awesome.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.200
Yeah, well your taste is dodgy
at the best of times.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.360
Bullshit.
It's what you'd paint a brothel.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.280
What are you putting that on for?

43:14.360 --> 43:16.200
So I can smell good.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.880
You're going to a business meeting
smelling of perfume?

43:19.960 --> 43:21.200
What's that all about?

43:21.280 --> 43:22.800
It's not perfume,
it's men's fragrance.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.680
You're sure you're not going
to a gay bar or something?

43:24.760 --> 43:26.800
It's a bit weird, if you ask me.
Why are you bein' a bitch?

43:26.880 --> 43:29.600
Because I know when you're up
to something, Pasquale Barbaro.

43:29.680 --> 43:30.760
Piss off.

43:40.280 --> 43:44.080
So, I've never actually
asked you before.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.200
What do you do?
For work, I mean.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.640
Oh, I'm in
the construction business.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.120
Yeah, yeah.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.320
I got some property
being developed in Darling Point.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.240
The best view.
It's an awesome spot.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.120
Right,
so you're a property developer?

43:56.200 --> 43:58.640
Yeah, yeah.
That's right, a property developer.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.360
But I'm into construction and stuff.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.440
I'm getting some cranes.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.600
Right, OK.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.400
What?

44:08.080 --> 44:10.920
Nothing.
No, no, tell me, what?

44:11.000 --> 44:12.320
Is there something wrong with that?

44:13.320 --> 44:14.880
No, I was...

44:14.960 --> 44:16.400
This is gonna sound
really stupid,

44:16.480 --> 44:20.280
but I thought maybe you were like
a gangster or something.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.160
My girlfriend asked me
what you did

44:22.240 --> 44:24.960
and I was like,
"Well, he's got all these tatts

44:25.040 --> 44:27.240
"and money and he drives a Lambo,"

44:27.320 --> 44:29.400
and she was like,
"Well, maybe he's a drug dealer."

44:29.480 --> 44:33.600
And I was like, we were laughing
about how funny that would be that,

44:33.680 --> 44:34.840
you know,
maybe I was going on a date

44:34.920 --> 44:38.040
with a big-time gangster
like in 'The Sopranos' you know?

44:38.120 --> 44:40.040
Yeah, I mean how stupid is that?

44:40.120 --> 44:41.680
Well, yeah, yeah.

44:41.760 --> 44:44.520
I mean, um...
That's cool.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.920
Ah. Shit.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.920
What?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.360
Nothing.

44:56.440 --> 44:57.800
Just ah, if something kicks off,
just...

44:57.880 --> 45:00.680
Barbaro.
Hey, hey, fellas, what's happening?

45:00.760 --> 45:02.640
Aren't youse in the wrong joint?
KFC's down the road, huh?

45:02.720 --> 45:04.000
What are you doing, you dog?

45:04.080 --> 45:05.560
What do you mean?
I'm havin' dinner.

45:05.640 --> 45:06.840
What does it look like?
You're dead.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.440
We know what you did to Mahmoud.
Hey, I did nothing.

45:08.520 --> 45:09.960
What are you talking about?
Barbaro.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.120
Right in front of me.
Hey, why don't you piss off, huh?

45:12.200 --> 45:13.600
Shut the hell up.
Little Crazy's on his way.

45:13.680 --> 45:14.920
What do you mean?
Come outside now.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.320
Hey, hey, hey, piss off, shithead.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.600
Hey, come here.
Come here, come here.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.640
Hey, piss off!
Get out of the way.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.320
Come on. Fuck you.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.360
Oh, my god.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.800
Mm-hm.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.480
So what do you reckon?

45:41.560 --> 45:43.160
Oh, this view.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.400
Fuck, you can see everything.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.560
Yeah, told you.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.000
This kitchen.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.680
I love that colour.

45:49.760 --> 45:50.920
What?
Yeah.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.040
That's what I reckon.
Mm.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.520
Really?
Yeah.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.000
What was that for?

46:01.080 --> 46:02.480
Well did I say you could kiss me?

46:02.560 --> 46:03.800
Nah, but like I thought...

46:06.920 --> 46:08.440
Are you...

46:26.320 --> 46:27.600
Hurry up.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.520
What are you doing?

46:40.520 --> 46:42.000
Eating a sandwich.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.680
I thought you went out for dinner.

46:44.320 --> 46:46.320
What happened to your shirt?
Nothin'.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.920
And your face. Your face is all red.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.400
It's nothing. Just some shit
with some blokes, that's all.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.640
Well, what blokes?
Some BFL dogs.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.320
I sorted 'em out, OK?

46:57.520 --> 46:59.400
What?
Were they wearing perfume?

46:59.480 --> 47:02.360
What?
The BFL dogs.

47:02.440 --> 47:05.080
Were they wearing Chanel No 5?
No.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.280
You come at 3:00am
from a business dinner

47:07.360 --> 47:08.800
and still hungry,
with a ripped shirt

47:08.880 --> 47:10.560
and stinking of perfume.
Oh, my god.

47:10.640 --> 47:11.840
Get dodgier.
Stop being paranoid.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.680
Get dodgier.
Stop being paranoid, would you?

47:13.760 --> 47:16.040
I got into a fight with some Arabs.
They ripped my shirt.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.760
I belted the shit out of them, OK?

47:17.840 --> 47:19.480
It's all good.
I'm goin' to bed.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.320
How's it goin', Pat?

47:46.160 --> 47:47.640
Who are you?

47:47.720 --> 47:49.600
Have a seat, mate.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.640
I thought I was meeting
the bloke and the chick.

47:51.720 --> 47:54.400
Doesn't make a difference.
It's all the same.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.480
So what's news?

48:04.240 --> 48:06.400
Look, I don't even why
I'm talking to youse.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.040
I don't even know youse.
Doesn't matter.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.640
We know your case back to front.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.560
Same rules apply.

48:11.640 --> 48:14.080
If you don't give us anything
then you go back to prison.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.880
This is bullshit.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.200
It is what it is, mate.

48:20.280 --> 48:23.000
We didn't put you
in this situation, you did.

48:23.080 --> 48:24.360
Yeah?

48:27.240 --> 48:28.960
So how do you want to play things,
Pat?

48:34.920 --> 48:36.600
You heard of Little Crazy?

48:37.400 --> 48:38.680
The name's Hamzy.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.280
Hamzy? Mohammed Hamzy?
What about him?

48:43.360 --> 48:45.440
Yeah, yeah, I heard something.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.480
I heard he shot his mate
or something.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.960
Yeah?
Yeah.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.200
Who?

48:50.280 --> 48:53.600
Gets in a fight with his own mates.
Shoots one of 'em in the neck.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.840
Killed him.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.680
You're talkin' about Yehya Amoud?

48:58.760 --> 49:00.040
He was murdered in Yagoona.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.440
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.760
Little Crazy done that.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.720
With his cousin, um...

49:10.920 --> 49:13.960
Cousin, um, Mahmoud.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.440
With his cousin Mahmoud.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.840
Get up! Get up!
Get your hands up!

49:35.560 --> 49:37.120
'cause I know youse love bacon,

49:37.200 --> 49:39.120
does that make you
cannibals or what?

Hey, to good health.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.320
Thank you.

50:39.400 --> 50:40.760
What'd I tell you, huh?

50:40.840 --> 50:43.680
Top of the world.
Here, come here, look at this.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.400
Cranes everywhere.

50:45.480 --> 50:48.880
One, two, three, four,

50:48.960 --> 50:51.720
five, six, seven, eight.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.240
You see those building sites?

50:55.320 --> 50:56.440
Any of 'em.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.560
All them companies
that own those cranes

50:58.640 --> 51:01.680
would turn around about
20 million bucks a year, all legit.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.120
But they're doin'
like heaps of other jobs.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.800
Heaps of 'em.
Tell him, tell him.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.840
Most of these companies have got
five to ten jobs going at once.

51:06.920 --> 51:08.480
I've already told him that.
Tell him about the cash.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
Tell him about that.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.120
Now, what we do is pay part
of the wages to the tradies in cash.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.560
Cash. All cash.

51:13.640 --> 51:16.160
No, it's not all cash,
it's partly cash.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.960
So you wash the money
that you're making selling gear

51:19.040 --> 51:21.960
by paying out wages, right?
Equipment hire too, yeah?

51:22.040 --> 51:24.720
So you pay out in cash,
get proper receipts,

51:24.800 --> 51:27.240
and then suddenly all that money
that you're making selling gear

51:27.320 --> 51:29.040
becomes legit. It's a win-win.
You can't lose.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.320
Tell him about the other thing.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.960
Tell him about the tradies
wanting these ones.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.840
Well, I'm trying to.
Yeah, but hurry up, you slow bastard.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.280
You're taking too long.
Can you just shut up?

51:35.360 --> 51:36.840
Just let me finish,
say what I gotta say.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.040
Say it.

51:38.120 --> 51:41.560
Alright, the bonus is, tradies,
they love to get wasted, right?

51:41.640 --> 51:43.040
So you can sell 'em a bit of this,
a bit of that,

51:43.120 --> 51:44.280
so straight off the building site

51:44.360 --> 51:46.320
and use that same cash
to pay their wages.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.920
I've already told him that.
You'll make a fortune.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.480
So then why
do you want me to say it?

51:49.560 --> 51:52.520
What do you want me to say this for?
Sit down, sit down.

51:52.600 --> 51:53.880
What do youse reckon?

51:56.160 --> 51:58.200
Yeah.
Like the sound of it or what?

51:58.280 --> 51:59.840
I told you.
Yeah.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.080
Didn't I?
Mm-hm.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.080
Huh? So his mate is selling
a piece of his crane company.

52:04.160 --> 52:07.640
Yeah. I've got an associate of mine
selling a stake of his company.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.800
A whole bunch of cranes
all over the place, man.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.680
We're buying into something
that's already making money,

52:11.760 --> 52:13.080
you know what I'm saying?

52:13.160 --> 52:14.760
All we gotta do is come up
with the cash for the buy in.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.920
We put it in three ways.
We go in equal partners. Easy.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.280
How much, brother?

52:19.360 --> 52:21.120
8.5 mill, all up.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.640
Yeah?
But each of us needs to put 2.2.

52:24.720 --> 52:25.760
You're good for it?

52:26.920 --> 52:29.080
Yeah.
Good.

52:29.160 --> 52:32.000
The rest is gonna come from assets
I own from a scaffolding company.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.280
What's that?

52:33.360 --> 52:35.800
It's just this company I owned
with a guy called Joe Antoun,

52:35.880 --> 52:38.000
but he's being a bit of a prick
at the moment but don't worry,

52:38.080 --> 52:39.240
I'll sort it out.

52:39.320 --> 52:41.080
Who is this bloke?
He's a dickhead.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.200
Don't worry about it.

52:42.280 --> 52:44.200
He's moved onto
this big George Alex project.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.480
He's all up himself now.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.520
George is a massive,
massive property developer.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.760
He's doing shit all over town.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.640
Joe's just stalling me
on this scaffolding thing.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.520
Don't worry. I'm gonna meet up
with him tomorrow night,

52:52.600 --> 52:54.320
but we're gonna get it sorted out.
It's normal bullshit.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.920
Youse just don't need to worry
at all.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.160
It's alright. Don't worry.

52:58.440 --> 52:59.720
Sort this out, you know?

53:01.280 --> 53:03.160
So we put in 2.2,

53:03.240 --> 53:05.200
then we're in business
with the cranes?

53:05.280 --> 53:06.960
Yeah.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.400
But the deal can't go ahead
till you sort your shit out

53:09.480 --> 53:10.480
with this Antoun bloke?

53:11.760 --> 53:13.120
Pretty much.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.640
You want us to help sort that out?

53:19.600 --> 53:21.000
If we're partners.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.840
For sure.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.120
We'll come with youse tomorrow night
then, brother.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.920
Told you. Didn't I?

53:31.720 --> 53:33.880
We're partners now, brother.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.760
We're gonna run this city.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.840
Are you goin' out?

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Yeah.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.600
Where?

53:50.680 --> 53:52.240
To the movies with Suze.

53:57.680 --> 53:59.040
Where are you going?

53:59.120 --> 54:01.120
I've got a meeting.
A big one.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.240
Important.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.120
Hope you got a babysitter.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.080
What?
I didn't get one.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.280
Why not?

54:07.360 --> 54:10.120
Because I'm sick of organising
everything around here,

54:10.200 --> 54:12.080
so you can go out rooting skanks.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.160
I'm not rooting skanks.
What are you...

54:14.240 --> 54:16.680
Whatever.
I'm going to the movies.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.520
I didn't get a babysitter.
It's your problem.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.280
No, no, I've got a meeting.
I've got, hey!

54:20.360 --> 54:22.280
I've got an important meeting.
I couldn't give a shit.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.240
I've got an important meeting!

54:30.040 --> 54:31.480
Ah, that's mine!

54:31.560 --> 54:33.080
It's not.
That's mine!

54:33.160 --> 54:34.960
Hey, hey, stop it!
Hey, stop it, youse two.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.000
Get on the couch.
Get on the couch, Maria, right now.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.800
I want you to stop
this nonsense, alright?

54:40.880 --> 54:42.120
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.800
I need both of you
to cut this shit out now, OK?

54:44.880 --> 54:48.320
If you're good, you can watch a movie
but only if you're good, alright?

54:49.240 --> 54:51.040
(PHONE RINGING)

54:51.120 --> 54:52.360
Yeah, Les.

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, OK, OK.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.720
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I gotta sort out
this shit with the kids.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.000
Yeah, I had to get a babysitter
last minute.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.800
Yeah, OK, OK, OK, I'll be there.
Half an hour.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.760
Hey, listen, alright, bye.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.840
Shit.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.440
Alright, listen.

55:12.520 --> 55:16.040
I need both of youse to sit here
and watch the movie, OK?

55:16.120 --> 55:17.800
But if I hear any noise
out of both of you,

55:17.880 --> 55:21.200
you're going straight to bed.
Alright? OK?

55:21.280 --> 55:23.160
I love you both.
Dinner's almost ready.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.640
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

55:36.600 --> 55:37.720
Shit.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.160
Ah!

55:46.400 --> 55:48.160
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Pat.

55:48.240 --> 55:51.160
Sorry. I've cooked some pasta,
the kids are watching a movie.

55:51.240 --> 55:53.000
If you can throw some cheese on it,
give it to 'em, yeah?

55:53.080 --> 55:54.160
Yeah, too easy.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.040
Hey, if they eat all their dinner,
give 'em a Tim Tam, yeah?

55:56.120 --> 55:57.080
OK.
Yeah.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.880
Hey, thanks a lot for this.
I'll be back in a few hours.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.120
I'll give you some extra cash, yeah?

56:00.200 --> 56:02.400
Yeah, yeah, it's all good.
Thank you.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.120
Have a look at this place, huh?

56:30.320 --> 56:31.760
Yeah, what'd I tell you?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.880
I said it, didn't I?
I said you and me, mate.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.280
Pretty soon blokes like this,

56:36.360 --> 56:37.720
they're gonna be walking around
this joint.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.040
You know what
they're gonna be saying?

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
"Look at them two dudes,

56:40.200 --> 56:42.240
"with the fresh clothes
and them awesome tatts.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.400
"Them dudes is bosses."
You know what I mean?

56:44.480 --> 56:45.520
Yeah?

56:45.600 --> 56:47.320
Hey, Les.
Yeah?

56:47.400 --> 56:48.640
How're you goin'?

56:48.720 --> 56:50.760
Joe.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.920
See you brought some mates with you,
did you, Les?

56:53.000 --> 56:54.920
What's all this about, mate?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.320
What's with this?
I see you brought some mates too.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.640
What'd you wanna see me about,
brother?

57:00.720 --> 57:02.520
I need the paperwork
for the scaffold

57:02.600 --> 57:04.120
and the title deeds.
Can I have 'em?

57:04.200 --> 57:06.960
I thought I told you, mate.
They're all gone.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.400
You tryna be funny?
Not at all, buddy.

57:09.480 --> 57:10.800
The company went broke.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.040
Assets have all been sold

57:12.120 --> 57:13.320
and the receivers
took all the money.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.760
Are you seriously
trying to phoenix me, Joe?

57:14.840 --> 57:16.040
Phoenix you?

57:16.120 --> 57:18.000
Hey, given that you fucked
the company in the first place.

57:18.080 --> 57:20.280
Mate, it went broke.
No one's trying to phoenix anyone.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.880
That's total bullshit
and you know it.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.320
Hey, listen.

57:23.400 --> 57:24.960
We come for the title deeds, yeah?

57:25.040 --> 57:26.520
We're not leavin' till we get 'em.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.200
Is there a circus in town
or something?

57:29.280 --> 57:30.880
What's that?

57:30.960 --> 57:32.200
You're a clown.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.080
What I'm saying is,
you're a fucking clown.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.320
Fuck you, arsehole.
You wanna have a crack or what?

57:40.320 --> 57:41.720
Listen here, bozo.

57:42.400 --> 57:45.360
There's 20 different sites
around here all pouring concrete.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.360
You could find yourself part
of the construction industry

57:47.440 --> 57:49.480
in a way that you might not like.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.200
You get the drift, dickhead?

57:51.280 --> 57:53.000
Yeah? Fuck you!

57:53.080 --> 57:54.600
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.240
Pull your head in.
Just relax.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.440
Fuck you.

57:57.520 --> 57:59.520
Get back. Get back.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.440
No one's trying to have
a crack at you guys.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.480
Just get back.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.200
By the way, Les,
you owe me 47 grand

58:08.280 --> 58:09.840
for legals and stamp duty, OK?

58:09.920 --> 58:11.800
I paid for it after the sale.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.800
Why don't you let me know
how you're gonna pay that?

58:20.560 --> 58:22.400
You're a real prick,
you know that, Joe?

58:22.480 --> 58:25.680
By the way, fellas,
this is George Alex's site, hey?

58:25.760 --> 58:28.040
He's a respectable bloke
and he doesn't like crims here,

58:28.120 --> 58:31.360
so I suggest you leave.
Thanks.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.920
Let's go, boys.
Yeah, dickhead.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.440
That's right, keep walking!

58:35.520 --> 58:36.920
(PHONE RING)

58:37.800 --> 58:38.920
Natalie?

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Yeah, hi.

58:40.080 --> 58:41.760
Um, so the kids
are really freaking out.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.360
They're like super upset.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.640
Why, what's happened?

58:44.720 --> 58:47.120
Someone put a horror movie
on the DVD player.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.800
It's the about that psycho doll.

58:48.880 --> 58:50.040
Shit!

58:50.120 --> 58:51.400
Anyway, I didn't realise it was on

58:51.480 --> 58:52.880
and they've watched
quite a bit of it.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.520
It's completely
freaked the shit out of them.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.040
Like, they won't stop crying.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.360
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey listen,
I'll be home soon, OK?

58:58.440 --> 58:59.640
OK, easy.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.880
Hey, I've gotta go.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.520
My kids, I've gotta go.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.480
It's OK, guys.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.200
Hey, hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.280
Come here.

59:13.360 --> 59:16.400
Hey, buddy, hey, it's alright.
It's alright, it's OK.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.720
It's alright.
Hey, hey, hey what happened?

59:18.800 --> 59:21.320
The doll put a knife
in the doll,

59:21.400 --> 59:23.360
blood came out and she got dead.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.720
Hey, it's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.400
It's not real.
There's nothin' to worry about.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.600
Don't worry.

59:28.680 --> 59:30.720
They've kinda been alternating
between being quiet for a while

59:30.800 --> 59:31.880
and then just losing it.

59:31.960 --> 59:33.440
What the fuck?
Should I...

59:33.520 --> 59:36.280
Hey, hey, what's happened?

59:36.360 --> 59:37.640
What's wrong with the kids?

59:37.720 --> 59:40.000
Hey, you two. It's OK.
Nothing, they're just tired.

59:41.320 --> 59:43.440
They've been great,
haven't they, Natalie?

59:43.520 --> 59:44.840
Um, yeah.

59:44.920 --> 59:46.360
Just gonna fix her up, babe.

59:46.440 --> 59:47.960
Hey, come up here.
Come here, come here.

59:49.200 --> 59:52.000
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't say anything, yeah?

59:52.080 --> 59:53.240
Yeah.

1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:16.640
I don't know
what's got into those kids.

1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:18.840
It's almost
like something scared them.

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:21.000
You reckon?

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.240
Do you think the babysitter
did something?

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:25.960
I don't know, maybe.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:28.960
I don't think
we should get her anymore.

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.280
Ah, no way.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000
She probably told 'em,
like, a ghost story or something.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.560
What movie did you see?

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:43.080
'Bad Grandpa'.
It was so funny.

1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:45.040
Cool.

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:50.080
Hey, sorry I gave you
all that crap before.

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.800
How was your meeting?

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:54.240
It was pretty shit,
but it'll be sweet.

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:17.480
They just need a good night's sleep,
that's all.

1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:20.960
Goodnight.
Night, babe.

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.000

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.080
Shh! Shh, shh.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.600
I should have just decked him
when I got there.

1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:38.040
I shouldn't
have even asked questions,

1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.560
just go bang, just give it to him.

1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:43.640
Hey, what happened to you?

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.360
Mate, I'm so tired.

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:47.880
My kids,
they've been having these nightmares.

1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:49.520
They've been kicking me in the back.

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.040
I haven't slept at all.

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:52.560
Want a coffee, bro?

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:57.040
Shit, yeah.
Ah, latte, it be awesome. Yeah.

1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.320
We're just talking about
this Joe Antoun bullshit.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:02.920
Guy's a fucking wanker.
What was all that shit about?

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.480
He finished the company we had.

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.960
I mean, he siphoned all my assets,
man. I'm screwed.

1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:08.360
I'm down more than two mill.

1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:10.320
What does that mean with the cranes?

1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:12.520
I don't know, brother.
I'll just have to work it out.

1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:15.120
Work it out?
Why didn't you work it out before?

1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:16.800
I mean, you don't have to have
a go at me, man.

1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:18.760
How was I s'posed to know he was
gonna pull this bullshit on me?

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:20.000
What do you mean?
You shoulda known.

1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:21.480
Is this gonna affect the deal?
Yeah, maybe.

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:22.920
But you don't have to be
a dickhead about it!

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.160
Hey, it affects all of us.
I get it.

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.080
Yeah, so what are you going to do
about this Antoun wanker?

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:27.520
I'll work it out.

1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:30.240
Work it out.
I'll work it out, man.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:31.920
I always do.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.400
Why don't you just kill him?

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:38.720
What are youse talkin' about?

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.760
Antoun. We should knock him.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.760
Yeah. Good idea.

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:44.360
Well, that's a very good idea.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.280
Yeah, and you should pay for it.

1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:48.440
Why should I pay for it?

1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:50.160
You brought us a deal
covered in shit.

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.440
You should be the one to clean it up.

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:53.320
No, no, no, no, I'll pay for it,
no problem, I'll pay for it,

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:54.720
but you do the hit, smartarse.
Piss off!

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:56.800
Come on, you big mouth.
Yeah, you should do it.

1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:58.120
You scared?
Nah.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:02:59.680
You're scared, eh.
Nah, we should talk about...

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:01.200
You're scared.
We should talk about who does it.

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:02.600
He insulted you.
He called you a clown.

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:03.840
Hey, he's a dog, yeah,
but you know...

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.400
Yeah, but what?
You have to do it, brother.

1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:09.440
Alright, I'll do it.

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:11.760
For 200K.
That's how much I want.

1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:14.000
Here you go.
You're not gonna do it.

1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:15.360
I'll do it.
You're not gonna do it.

1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:18.080
He's not gonna do it, man.
Hey! Bullshit, I'll do it.

1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.040
Just said I will.

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.120
Got no problem, mate.

1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:43.440
Hey, did you ever see 'Mr Squiggle'?

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:45.680
What's that?
The TV show?

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:48.200
You never saw 'Mr Squiggle'?
Nah.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:49.760
It was kind of a weird show.

1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.160
It was about this like puppet
or a bird or something,

1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:55.000
I don't really know.
And he had this long, pencil nose.

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:57.360
And the blackboard on it
always had the shits.

1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:59.680
What?
The blackboard.

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:01.960
He was like this grumpy prick
and he was always telling him like,

1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:03.720
"Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up."

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:06.280
And Mr Squiggle would always draw
these like cartoons,

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.200
and they'd always be upside down
when they started

1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:10.080
and then he'd flip 'em up
the right way when he...

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:11.840
You never saw 'Mr Squiggle'?

1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:15.040
Nah, I was in Kandahar.
Where's that? Out west?

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:18.360
Afghanistan. We didn't have a TV.

1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.880
You're serious?
You didn't have a TV?

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:22.840
Nah.

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.360
When I was eight,
my school got bombed by Russians,

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.840
and my teacher
and most of my mates got killed.

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:33.280
I ran to a shelter, so I was OK,
but my family had to leave.

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:35.880
So we lived in refugee camps
and shit.

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:41.360
Shit man, that's pretty heavy.

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:46.360
There he is.

1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:47.440
Is that him?

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:48.720
Mm-hm.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:08.400
That's when you can get him,
when he gets out of the car.

1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:12.480
Before he goes back inside.

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.200
Yeah.

1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:20.000
You gotta be waiting.

1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:24.040
Yeah. Sweet.

1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:31.080
OK, you two, I'm going to run a bath
and put you to bed,

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:33.040
and tonight,
you're sleeping in your own beds.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:34.600
BOTH: No!
Yeah.

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:36.240
Yes, I'm sick of you in the big bed.

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:38.400
Daddy and I haven't had
a decent night's sleep in ages.

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:40.640
No, Mummy,
I don't want to sleep in my bed.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.760
What's wrong with your bed?
The doll will get me.

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:45.560
What's all this about a doll?

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:47.400
They keep saying
they're scared of some doll.

1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:48.880
I don't know
what they're talking about.

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:50.240
The doll in the movie.

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:51.480
OK, let's get youse in the bath.

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:52.800
Hey, what'd you just say, Gio?

1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:54.200
The doll in the movie.

1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:55.400
What doll movie?

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:56.760
Daddy, show it.
The DVD.

1:05:56.840 --> 1:05:58.600
Come on, mate. Come on.
Let's get you in the bath.

1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:00.120
What DVD?
In there.

1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:01.320
Well, can you go get it?
Come on.

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:03.120
Can you go get the DVD for Mummy?

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:05.640
Did you show them some DVD?
Hey, he's making it up.

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:06.880
Come on, come on.

1:06:06.960 --> 1:06:08.440
Maria.

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:10.120
Maria, come on, come on.

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:13.400
'Child's Play'?
This is a horror movie.

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:14.520
I've never heard of it.

1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:16.600
It's a movie
about the killer doll, Chucky.

1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:18.800
Chucky makes people be dead.

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:20.440
Daddy show it.
No. Hey!

1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.040
Did you show them this?
No! No way. Come on.

1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:23.880
Let's go to the bath...
Well, why are they saying you did?

1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:25.480
I don't know. Come on,
let's get you two in the bath.

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:26.640
You showed them Chucky, didn't you?

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.120
That's why they won't sleep
in their own beds.

1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:30.120
Because you showed our children
a horror movie.

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:32.920
No, I, but not on purpose.
Oh, my god, Pas. Oh, my god.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.040
It was an accident.
I thought it was something else.

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:36.960
I was racing out the other night.
It was when I was in a hurry.

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.880
You're an idiot. You're an idiot.
It was when I was in a hurry.

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:40.560
They're gonna need
psychiatric treatment.

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.880
Come on you two, bath time.
You are a little dickhead!

Yeah.

This is for your family.

they're kicking the shit out of me.

a good night's sleep in ages.

What does that mean?

1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.360
It means there were kids there.

but I like it. It's good.

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:05.600
Why are you guys not eating?

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:08.120
Want some?

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:12.240
# Anybody else
no, no, no, no. #

1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:15.600
Yo, Masab, it's right here.
Up here.

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:17.720
It's right further up.
No, it's right here.

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:19.200
I'm tellin' you, it's right here.

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:20.400
It's hard to turn left further down.

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.120
It's easier
if we go right on the next one.

1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:23.280
I googled it.

1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:28.120
# Down to the riptide

1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:29.880
# Taken away to the dark side

1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:32.800
# I wanna be your left hand man

1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:36.720
# I love you
when you're singing that song... #

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.480
Hey, you heard anything yet?

1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:39.560
Nah.

1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.560
Hey, we're s'posed to be seen, yeah?
Make a lot of noise.

1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:46.640
Yeah. That's right.
Yeah? Get up there. Go on.

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:48.600
Why do I have to get up there,
wanker?

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:50.080
Who thinks Les should get up there?

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:51.440
Yeah, go on. Get up there.

1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:53.120
Get up there.
Go, brother.

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.600
Take your beer with you.

1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:55.920
Don't worry, I'm gonna get up there.

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.680
Get the applause ready, yeah?

1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:00.480
Take it easy, alright.

1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:01.760
Hello, darling.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:17.480
Put your hoodie up, man.
Make sure it's over your face.

1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.360
Yeah, yeah. I know what I'm doing.

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.040
Go on, be loud.
Show us how loud you can be.

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.800
Show us all
for the boys.

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:42.200
Just sing it!
Just sing it, you dog!

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:44.000
What song are you singing?

1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:46.280
Ah, this one's to you,
you fuckin' dickhead.

1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:47.720
Oh, you, dickhead!

1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:50.240
# We'll start a revolution

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.880
# We'll make the street free

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:56.360
# We'll never weaken
we'll give it our best. #

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:01.080
(RINGS DOORBELL)

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.520
Yes?

1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:14.520
Ah, hello.

1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:15.880
Is, ah, Joe there?

1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:18.600
I have this ledger book
to deliver to him.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:21.120
Ah, yeah.

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.040
Hang on.
Thank you.

1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:25.480
Joe!

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:31.080
# Can't be defeated

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.600
# Don't know the word

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.560
# Shoulder to shoulder

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:37.680
# We'll fight the world... #

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.600
Come on, boys, yeah!

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:42.000
# We can't be beaten! #

1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:48.200
Yeah, mate.

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:53.760
# We can't be beaten... #

1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:55.280
One more time!

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:57.800
# We can't be beaten... #

1:16:57.880 --> 1:16:59.880
Now, sing it, boys!

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:02.320
# We can't be beaten... #

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:10.120
Send an ambulance!

1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:12.360
Go, in the other room. Go!

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.560
# Shoulder to shoulder

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:17.320
# We fight the world

1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:23.440
# We can't be beaten... #

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:25.520
Hey. It's done.

1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:30.000
# We can't be beaten... #

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:31.240
Come on, guys!

Fuck, I love it.

1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:37.520
(OVERLAPPING SPEECH)

1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:39.360
What's that?
You shoulda done that song, bro.

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:41.080
Hey, hey, hey!
What?

1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:42.400
Look.

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:47.800
No one's gonna fuck with us now, eh?

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.040
Yeah.

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.560
Come on, let's go.
Let's get a feed.

1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:16.440
(INTENSE MUSIC)

1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:43.080
We're OK.

1:18:43.160 --> 1:18:46.080
I love you.
I love you too.

1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.160
How's it going?
