WEBVTT

01:10.870 --> 01:14.274
So, it's becoming
more apparent

01:14.374 --> 01:16.743
that not only is Gabriel
getting stronger,

01:16.810 --> 01:18.812
he's becoming more malicious.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.815
If his strength and ability
continue to grow at this rate,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.984
we will no longer
be able to contain him.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.587
However, I am
still determined...

01:31.591 --> 01:33.393
Dr. Weaver,
he got out again.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.763
How far did he get this time?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.298
He made it all the way
to the records room

01:38.398 --> 01:39.332
before we got to him.
He found his information.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.633
He wants to go home.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.736
Dr. Fields, what the hell
is happening?

01:43.803 --> 01:45.105
I tried to subdue him
with ECT,

01:45.171 --> 01:46.739
but electroshock
had no effect on him.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.675
Then all the machines
started going crazy.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.244
It was like he was
drinking the electricity

01:51.311 --> 01:53.413
-and controlling our machines.
-

01:56.683 --> 01:58.485
Dr. Plume.
-

02:05.091 --> 02:08.127
No, please, don't.
He'll kill you.

02:08.194 --> 02:09.496
-Stand aside.
-

02:12.098 --> 02:13.299
Take him down now.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.635
-

02:20.473 --> 02:21.708
-

02:21.808 --> 02:24.010
-

02:25.712 --> 02:28.715
-

03:05.685 --> 03:07.654
Strap him into the chair.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.779
You've been a bad,
bad boy, Gabriel.

03:40.220 --> 03:46.960
I will kill you all.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.797
Oh, my God. He speaks.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.366
He's broadcasting
his thoughts.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.806
I thought we could help him,
but I was wrong.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.145
It's time

04:07.080 --> 04:10.383
we cut out the cancer.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.325
Frankie is trying
to get to Chavez.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.628
He's trying to get his arms up
to protect himself,

07:08.728 --> 07:10.630
but he can't get any leverage.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.000
Hey, sugar, I thought
you were on the late shift.

07:15.735 --> 07:20.473
I was, but dumpling's been
giving me a really hard time.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.650
What do you mean,
"a hard time"?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.018
I don't know.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.421
She's just a little more
agitated than usual.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.356
Do we have any Tylenol?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.325
They say I can't take aspirin.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.831
You know, if you've
got all this pain,

07:44.931 --> 07:46.699
maybe you shouldn't
be going to work.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.702
I'll be fine.
I promise.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.373
Hey, I was watching that.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.944
Please, Derek, I really
need to get some rest.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.713
No, maybe you need
to stop getting pregnant.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.616
Derek, please. I just
really need to lie down.

08:03.683 --> 08:04.717
You know the doctor said

08:04.817 --> 08:06.786
this could happen
again, right?

08:06.853 --> 08:08.454
You know that.

08:08.521 --> 08:09.722
How many times
do I have to watch

08:09.822 --> 08:11.157
my children die
inside of you?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.226
Just stop.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.195
You're breaking my heart,
Maddy. I swear to God.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.534
You can't keep doing this.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.243
Doing what?

08:31.677 --> 08:35.481
Doing what, Madison?
Tell me what I'm doing, huh?

08:35.548 --> 08:36.582
Tell me what I'm doing.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.150
Are you saying
this is my fault?

08:38.217 --> 08:39.519
Are you saying this keeps
happening because of...

08:39.585 --> 08:40.887
Don't touch her!

08:42.154 --> 08:43.723
-You bitch!
-

08:44.991 --> 08:46.259
Oh, shit.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.094
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.097
I'm gonna get you
some ice, okay?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.999
Okay, I'm gonna get
you some ice. Hold on.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.426
-

09:56.829 --> 09:57.897
Babe,

09:59.231 --> 10:01.334
I'm sorry that happened,
that, uh...

10:02.935 --> 10:05.004
Sometimes it's like
I can't control myself, okay?

10:05.104 --> 10:07.473
But that's not me, that...

10:07.573 --> 10:11.444
You know, I'm trying,
and I've given up drinking,

10:11.510 --> 10:13.946
and I'm gonna continue
to do better

10:14.013 --> 10:17.350
-for you and the baby, okay?
-

10:23.122 --> 10:24.957
It was an accident, Maddy.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.009
Maddy?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.309
What?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.055
Madison?

12:46.232 --> 12:47.433
It cannot be!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.001
...grabbed
a steel blade.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.102
...has possession
of the puck down...

12:51.670 --> 12:53.005
...just now

12:53.105 --> 12:55.975
-

12:56.609 --> 12:57.610
Help me.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.895
-

14:34.607 --> 14:36.075
Derek?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.113
-

16:01.860 --> 16:03.195
Morning, Reg.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.832
Morning? It's 4 a.m.
Night's not even over yet.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.100
-Detectives.
-Officer Lee,

16:08.167 --> 16:09.201
what happened here?

16:09.301 --> 16:10.469
Home invasion.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.204
Neighbors heard screaming
and called it in.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.642
Any sign
of forced entry?

16:16.709 --> 16:17.943
Not that we've seen.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.880
-Where's the wife?
-Already at the hospital.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.316
We found her unconscious
in the nursery.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.285
Uh-oh, here comes
Miss Lonely-heart.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.155
-Hey, Kekoa.
-Winnie, how bad is it?

16:30.222 --> 16:31.857
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.793
Maybe from a vehicular
accident, but not this.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.462
This is something special.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.135
Holy shit.

16:56.248 --> 16:57.349
Sydney?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.087
Hi. Hi.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.326
Where am I?
What... What happened?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.495
It's okay.
You're in a hospital.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.096
Where's Derek?

17:11.196 --> 17:15.200
Do you remember what happened?
Someone broke into your house.

17:16.402 --> 17:20.272
You were attacked,
and Derek...

17:20.372 --> 17:21.840
I was...

17:23.375 --> 17:25.244
-Just... Just rest.
-I was...

17:25.344 --> 17:27.746
I was so scared.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.884
Scared for my baby.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.193
Where is she?

17:43.762 --> 17:46.432
Where is she, Syd?
Where is she?

17:48.700 --> 17:52.071
I'm so sorry, Maddy.
They couldn't save her.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.409
No.

17:58.777 --> 18:02.815
No, no, no. No. No.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.955
It's okay.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.925
No! Please, no.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.327
No!

18:15.427 --> 18:16.995
Hey, okay.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.564
No!

18:29.274 --> 18:30.442
Mrs. Mitchell?

18:31.743 --> 18:34.413
Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.682
I'm sorry to bother you,

18:36.782 --> 18:38.984
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.286
Mrs. Mitchell?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.691
Can I help you
with something?

18:45.791 --> 18:48.694
Uh, I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.030
Oh, I'm Sydney Lake.
I'm Madison's sister.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.533
So, can I help you?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.170
Oh, this.

18:58.270 --> 19:03.809
Um, I'm a...
a princess at Family Planet.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.210
So, I'm on my lunch break,

19:05.310 --> 19:08.046
and I thought I'd come by
and check on Maddy.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.783
She's been like this
for two days.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.652
I can't even get her to eat.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.154
Well, maybe
you can help me then.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.522
Did you know of anyone
who wanted

19:16.622 --> 19:18.390
to hurt your sister
or her husband?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.058
There's no sign
of forced entry at the house.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.360
May have been
somebody they knew.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.895
Somebody with access.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.365
I wouldn't know.
Derek kept us apart.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.801
This isn't her first, right?

19:29.868 --> 19:31.236
The doctor said your sister

19:31.336 --> 19:33.505
had three miscarriages
in the last two years.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.408
Oh, my God.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.312
Um, I didn't know.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.082
I don't know why
she wouldn't have told me.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.554
Maddy...

19:56.028 --> 19:58.096
If there's anything,
just give me a call.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.231
Yeah. Thank you.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.378
Keh,
you'll get a kick out of this.

20:13.445 --> 20:16.782
No fingerprints, but all the
hand patterns are upside down.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.117
Like our perp was hanging
from the ceiling.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.019
That line up with anything
from forensics?

20:21.086 --> 20:23.922
No footprints on the ceiling,
if that's what you mean.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.758
But I spoke to the neighbors,
and more than one of them said

20:26.858 --> 20:30.762
that Mr. Mitchell used to
knock Mrs. Mitchell around.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.965
He beat her?

20:33.065 --> 20:36.802
No forced entry,
an abusive husband.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.604
Motive.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.120
Please let me stay
with you for a few days.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.590
I can blow off work,
and a few auditions.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.460
It's not like I'm booking
anything anyway.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.567
It felt so real this time.

21:13.472 --> 21:14.506
I just...

21:16.775 --> 21:19.645
I just couldn't do enough
to protect her.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.687
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.456
I know,
but this is my home,

21:31.523 --> 21:34.660
and I'm not gonna let it be
taken away from me too.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.597
I'll be fine, I promise.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.445
-

23:54.266 --> 23:55.967
-

24:21.760 --> 24:24.529
There's nobody there.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.331
There's no one there.

24:26.431 --> 24:29.034
It's all in my head.
It's all in my head.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.603
There's no one there.
It's all in my...

24:32.971 --> 24:34.339
It's all in my head.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.402
Oh, my God.

26:10.468 --> 26:13.638
-Hey, are you gonna let me in?
-

26:13.738 --> 26:16.374
Jesus, Sydney,
what are you doing?

26:16.441 --> 26:20.145
Okay. My key wasn't
working and you weren't...

26:20.245 --> 26:21.146
Oh, God.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.614
You weren't answering.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.551
I thought something was wrong,
I was worried.

26:28.887 --> 26:29.955
Thanks.

26:34.225 --> 26:37.128
Oh, I, um,
installed deadbolts.

26:37.228 --> 26:40.732
That makes so much sense.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.501
Well, okay.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.136
Mom made a casserole.

26:45.236 --> 26:48.473
I could not climb with it,
so it is outside, but,

26:48.573 --> 26:49.741
um...

26:51.076 --> 26:52.310
You okay?

26:54.579 --> 26:55.614
Derek did that.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.184
He smashed my head
against the wall.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.418
What?

27:01.953 --> 27:04.122
I'm so sorry, Maddy.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.625
Nobody deserves
to die that way,

27:06.691 --> 27:09.694
but seriously, fuck him.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.198
You deserve so much better.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.035
I thought about it a lot,
about leaving him.

27:17.135 --> 27:21.139
By the time I got the courage,
I got pregnant.

27:23.308 --> 27:27.212
Now, if only I'd been able
to have a baby.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.881
Don't do that.
This is not your fault.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.516
That's not what I'm saying.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.721
I wanted to know
what it felt like

27:36.821 --> 27:39.724
to have a blood connection
with someone.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.028
A biological connection.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.231
Maddy, what are
you talking about?

27:48.199 --> 27:49.701
Shit.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.710
Mom and Dad took me in
when I was eight.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.048
I don't remember
anything before that.

28:03.148 --> 28:07.018
Mom told me that my biological
mother died during my birth.

28:08.386 --> 28:09.754
Sydney, I'm adopted.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.675
Welcome to
the Seattle Underground.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.744
No, folks, this is not
a historical tour

28:32.844 --> 28:35.113
-of Nirvana or Pearl Jam.
-

28:35.213 --> 28:37.082
This is a tour of old Seattle,

28:37.182 --> 28:38.283
buried underneath here

28:38.383 --> 28:40.418
like a time capsule
of a bygone era.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.053
All this used to be
at street level

28:42.120 --> 28:43.621
where the people worked
and lived.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.391
But after the great fire
of 1889,

28:46.458 --> 28:48.693
they decided to rebuild
the new city

28:48.760 --> 28:50.128
on top of the old city.

28:50.228 --> 28:53.131
One story higher
to stave off flooding.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.133
You can still see
the cobblestone streets

28:55.233 --> 28:57.569
and the storefronts down here.

28:57.635 --> 29:01.239
And there are rumors of
passages stretching for miles.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.141
Some say the ghosts
of the past

29:03.241 --> 29:04.743
still haunt these tunnels.

29:10.615 --> 29:13.151
Ooh.
-

29:13.785 --> 29:15.153
Thank you.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.990
Thank you. Have a good night.

29:54.859 --> 29:56.427
We're closed.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.007
You can't be down here.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.350
Hello?

30:45.710 --> 30:47.145
-

30:52.383 --> 30:53.985
-

32:22.340 --> 32:26.277
I can't tell you

32:26.344 --> 32:29.614
how long

32:29.681 --> 32:32.684
I've waited for this.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.522
But not yet.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.491
First,

32:40.591 --> 32:43.594
Dr. Weaver.

32:50.335 --> 32:51.602
Hello?

32:52.603 --> 32:53.805
Hello?

32:53.871 --> 32:56.474
Dr. Weaver.
-  Yes?

32:56.541 --> 33:01.479
It's time
to cut out the cancer.

33:01.546 --> 33:02.647
What?

33:04.449 --> 33:07.118
Hello?
I'm sorry, who is this?

33:08.553 --> 33:09.721
Hello?

34:24.429 --> 34:26.464
-

34:55.593 --> 34:57.728
-

35:20.618 --> 35:22.753
-

35:26.924 --> 35:27.925
Shit.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.785
-

35:57.889 --> 35:59.657
What are you doing
in my house?

35:59.724 --> 36:01.292
This is my house!

36:01.359 --> 36:02.994
Who are you?

36:03.060 --> 36:05.696
-

36:09.967 --> 36:12.737
I can't move.
What's happening?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.918
What do you want? Who are you?

36:30.521 --> 36:32.890
No!

37:02.019 --> 37:08.059
Time to cut out the cancer.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.629
Oh, God.
No. It's not possible.

37:15.866 --> 37:16.901
No.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.603
Oh, God.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.676
What do you want from me?

37:58.776 --> 38:03.514
To show you
what the cancer has become.

38:33.177 --> 38:34.545
Hey.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.715
So, housekeeper found our vic.
Dr. Florence Weaver.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.685
Tough old bird,
but she fought until the end.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.394
What you got, Winnie?

38:50.494 --> 38:52.129
He killed her
with one of her trophies.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.298
We just got the base.
The top half is missing.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.068
The brutality seems consistent
with our other corpse.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.471
-Same guy?
-That would be my bet.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.573
We need to find
that missing half.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.009
Yeah, don't we all.

39:13.818 --> 39:14.985
What you got?

39:17.555 --> 39:21.025
Dr. Weaver specialized in
child reconstructive surgery.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.828
She kept journals
on all her patients.

39:25.496 --> 39:26.430
Bag all these books.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.598
I want them back
at the precinct.

39:27.698 --> 39:28.933
Yes, sir.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.768
What, are you gonna
go through all of them?

39:30.868 --> 39:32.937
We're gonna go through
all of them.

39:34.905 --> 39:38.576
Hey, did you find the rest
of that murder weapon yet?

40:08.606 --> 40:10.608
-

40:32.396 --> 40:36.467
Don't even try.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.068
Breaking news this hour,

40:38.135 --> 40:39.970
as police are reporting
the body

40:40.070 --> 40:41.906
-  of Dr. Florence Weaver...
-

40:41.972 --> 40:43.407
...was found brutally murdered

40:43.474 --> 40:45.409
in her Washington Park home
this morning.

40:45.476 --> 40:48.345
The grisly discovery was made
by the housekeeper

40:48.446 --> 40:51.115
at approximately
8:30 this morning.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.685
Did you know her?

40:54.785 --> 40:56.520
No. No.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.624
But I saw her die.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.861
I don't know how.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.096
I was doing laundry and...

41:07.164 --> 41:09.967
and I saw him killing her.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.536
It was him. It was him.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.473
Him? Him, like the guy
that attacked you?

41:15.539 --> 41:16.540
Yes.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.209
He was here in the...

41:18.309 --> 41:19.710
No, no.

41:19.810 --> 41:23.514
I saw him murdering her
in her house.

41:23.614 --> 41:27.885
And it was like I was there
and here at the same time.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.222
It was... It was...
What is happening to me, Syd?

41:31.322 --> 41:32.456
Okay, okay.

41:34.725 --> 41:37.628
It'll be okay. We're gonna
figure it out, okay?

41:47.204 --> 41:49.073
That's it. I'm out.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.008
I read about
one more sick kid,

41:51.075 --> 41:53.644
my brain's gonna
push out my eyeballs.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.746
-Good night.
-Tell Marcus it's my fault.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.014
I'll make up for date night.

41:57.081 --> 41:58.682
You better.
He's pissed.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.019
Jesus.

42:05.656 --> 42:08.893
-Yo, Basco, you here?
-No.

42:13.497 --> 42:15.499
-I thought I was the only

42:15.566 --> 42:17.101
good-looking guy here
working late.

42:17.201 --> 42:21.672
Got this case. Strange one.
Can you age that up?

42:22.740 --> 42:24.241
How old do you need?

42:25.376 --> 42:26.777
30 years.

42:41.358 --> 42:42.293
I know, I know.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.128
But who would kill her, John?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.864
Let alone mutilate her
like that?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.468
I know, I haven't spoken
with her in years,

42:51.569 --> 42:56.540
but the person I knew, all she
ever did was help people.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.947
Don't bring up Simion.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.381
That was a different time.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.385
Hello? John?

44:20.891 --> 44:21.892
Hmm.

46:22.579 --> 46:25.249
-

47:11.995 --> 47:14.064
-Maddy? Maddy. Maddy.
-

47:14.164 --> 47:16.233
Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

47:16.333 --> 47:19.903
-He's here. He's here.
-Who? Who?

47:22.673 --> 47:24.241
There's no one here.

47:24.341 --> 47:25.843
Look at me,
there's no one here.

47:25.909 --> 47:28.312
You were just dreaming.
Come here.

47:28.378 --> 47:30.414
Shit, Maddy, you're bleeding.

47:31.381 --> 47:33.383
I wasn't dreaming.

47:33.483 --> 47:36.753
I saw him. I saw him.

47:36.854 --> 47:40.424
He killed again,
but this time I saw his face.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.193
I saw... I saw his face.

47:47.197 --> 47:49.366
Somehow
I'm seeing his murders,

47:49.433 --> 47:50.868
like he's showing them to me.

47:50.934 --> 47:52.536
What do you mean?
He's sending you videos?

47:52.603 --> 47:57.107
No, goddamn it. I see them
as they're happening.

47:57.207 --> 47:59.776
Like I'm having visions.
I know how that sounds.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.914
Okay, maybe, when the killer
attacked Madison,

48:04.014 --> 48:07.951
they formed,
like, some kind of, um,

48:08.051 --> 48:10.787
like a... a psychic bond.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.723
I mean, you guys
consult psychics for, like,

48:12.789 --> 48:15.192
missing persons cases, right?

48:15.259 --> 48:16.793
No, we don't.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.029
I played a psychic
in an episode of a cop show,

48:19.096 --> 48:21.798
and they said
it's a real thing.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.567
Are we really having
this conversation?

48:26.069 --> 48:29.773
Okay, Madison,
what exactly did you see?

48:29.873 --> 48:31.875
He killed again.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.378
This time, across from
the Silvercup apartments

48:34.444 --> 48:35.712
in North Beacon Hill.

48:35.779 --> 48:37.648
-I Googled it.
-Great.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.484
Wikipedia Brown here
just solved the case.

48:40.584 --> 48:44.254
Listen, Madison saw
Dr. Weaver die as it happened,

48:44.321 --> 48:46.957
and now she says she's seen
this one, so let's go look.

48:47.057 --> 48:48.659
If she's wrong, you can
have her committed,

48:48.759 --> 48:50.260
and you can put
the cuffs on me.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.648
There it is. Silvercup.

49:15.452 --> 49:16.653
I think it's this one.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.089
Which one?

49:19.156 --> 49:21.792
So what, are we gonna knock
on every door now?

49:21.858 --> 49:23.360
It's the top floor.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.361
We could help.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.430
Yeah, we don't need your help.

49:26.496 --> 49:28.365
Could you keep an eye
on these two?

49:32.536 --> 49:34.137
Come on, Keh.

49:39.176 --> 49:40.811
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

49:43.814 --> 49:44.848
What?

49:45.849 --> 49:47.217
I see you.

49:47.317 --> 49:50.654
What? They gave us a lead.

49:50.721 --> 49:52.656
Cute little actress
throw you a ball,

49:52.723 --> 49:54.224
and you gone chasing
like a dog.

49:54.324 --> 49:55.993
-What was that?
-Nothing.

50:06.470 --> 50:10.474
Hello? Anybody home?
This is the police.

50:10.540 --> 50:13.010
If anybody's here,
you need to let us know.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.027
Keh. Keh!

50:49.546 --> 50:53.183
So I'm putting out a BOLO
on Sloth from  The Goonies?

50:55.185 --> 50:57.220
-You okay? Okay.
-I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.124
Reg...

51:07.064 --> 51:10.467
Um, you wanna take a seat
while she... while you wait?

51:10.567 --> 51:12.202
Oh, yeah.

51:58.515 --> 51:59.516
Hello?

51:59.616 --> 52:02.519
Hello, Emily.

52:14.297 --> 52:17.501
My name is Madison.

52:17.601 --> 52:21.605
Your fake mother

52:21.671 --> 52:24.875
Your shitty marriage
gave you the name Mitchell.

52:24.975 --> 52:28.879
But you'll always
be Emily to me.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.380
Who are you?

52:30.480 --> 52:33.383
You know who I am.

52:33.483 --> 52:37.387
Even if they say
I'm only in your head.

52:37.487 --> 52:40.123
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:40.190 --> 52:43.560
You let them tell you
I wasn't real,

52:43.660 --> 52:45.495
that I was just a voice.

52:45.562 --> 52:47.731
And you believed them.

52:47.831 --> 52:52.502
Now, I'm going to make
them pay for what they did.

52:52.569 --> 52:54.971
One by one.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.072
Gabriel, no!

53:01.144 --> 53:02.712
See?

53:02.812 --> 53:05.048
-Deep down...
-Please.

53:05.148 --> 53:07.250
-...  you've always known.
-Please.

53:07.350 --> 53:10.420
Please stop. Please.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.391
Oh, we are
just getting started.

53:25.735 --> 53:26.937
Uh, Detective,
if we're done here,

53:27.037 --> 53:28.104
-we're leaving. Thank you.
-Um...

53:28.205 --> 53:31.041
Okay. All right, well, I'm...

53:31.107 --> 53:33.076
I'll see you around, okay?

53:35.946 --> 53:38.281
Hey, hey, hey,
you finish aging that photo?

53:38.381 --> 53:40.850
Yeah, I left it on your desk.
You saw it, right?

53:40.917 --> 53:42.919
That's why you brought her in.

53:43.019 --> 53:45.855
-Brought who in?
-The girl in the picture.

53:46.790 --> 53:47.791
Yeesh.

53:52.729 --> 53:54.130
Ah, hell.

53:54.231 --> 53:57.100
She was the doctor's patient.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.402
What? We've gotta turn around
and tell Kekoa.

53:59.469 --> 54:00.470
We can trace the call.

54:00.570 --> 54:02.639
The cops think I did it.

54:02.739 --> 54:03.807
Well, this will
prove them wrong.

54:03.907 --> 54:04.975
His name is Gabriel.

54:06.743 --> 54:07.811
I don't know how I knew,

54:07.911 --> 54:09.980
but talking to him,
I just did.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.250
He's someone from my past.

54:13.316 --> 54:15.385
From before I could remember.

54:21.925 --> 54:23.293
Where are we going?

54:37.474 --> 54:39.109
Oh, Maddy.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.111
Maddy.

54:41.177 --> 54:44.347
-I just had to see you.
-Oh.

54:44.447 --> 54:48.084
How are you holding up,
sweetie, hmm? Are you eating?

54:48.151 --> 54:51.855
You look skinny.
I gotta cook more.

54:51.955 --> 54:54.524
Mom, I need you to remember.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.594
During the adoption,
did they say

54:57.661 --> 54:59.996
if I had a brother
or anything?

55:01.798 --> 55:02.866
No.

55:04.534 --> 55:06.603
The only thing they would say
is if there were siblings,

55:06.670 --> 55:08.872
they try to place them
in the same family.

55:08.972 --> 55:10.607
Then who the hell is Gabriel?

55:15.945 --> 55:19.549
Mom?
Mom, what do you know?

55:28.291 --> 55:30.226
You wanted a party
so bad, Maddy,

55:30.327 --> 55:33.363
you nagged us
until your father gave in.

55:33.463 --> 55:35.231
We invited
your whole class but...

55:35.332 --> 55:37.000
They thought I was a freak.

55:37.067 --> 55:39.502
I had no friends.
I remember that.

55:50.747 --> 55:51.881
Blow it out, blow it out,
blow it out.

55:51.981 --> 55:53.049
For nine wishes.

55:58.254 --> 55:59.889
Those look good.
Looks good.

55:59.989 --> 56:01.825
Stop saying that.

56:03.827 --> 56:05.528
They are.

56:05.595 --> 56:09.232
Maddy, who are you talking to?

56:10.200 --> 56:11.735
No one.

56:11.835 --> 56:14.838
Maddy? Maddy,
what did we say about lying?

56:14.904 --> 56:16.172
I wasn't.

56:16.239 --> 56:18.375
Well, then
who were you talking to?

56:21.444 --> 56:22.579
Gabriel.

56:29.753 --> 56:32.756
Is he your imaginary friend?

56:32.856 --> 56:34.624
Gabriel isn't made up.

56:36.726 --> 56:39.129
He says that you are.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.698
He says you're not
my real family.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.405
-This is the nightmare that...
-  Okay.

56:51.908 --> 56:53.410
Ooh, that's a kick.

56:53.476 --> 56:54.911
-  Ooh.

56:54.978 --> 56:56.579
My little Christmas cutie
right here.

56:56.646 --> 56:59.215
-Go get her ready for bed.
-  Okay.

56:59.282 --> 57:01.317
Maddy, playtime's over.

57:01.418 --> 57:04.754
Santa won't come down the
chimney if you're still up.

57:04.821 --> 57:08.124
Mommy said she'd love me
when the baby comes.

57:08.224 --> 57:10.059
She said nothing would change.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.330
I won't.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.499
You can't make me.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.770
Please don't hurt the baby.

57:22.338 --> 57:24.574
Maddy? What's going on?

57:26.109 --> 57:27.477
Nothing, Daddy.

57:32.615 --> 57:35.018
Some of the conversations
you had with Gabriel

57:35.118 --> 57:36.820
just chilled us to the bone.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.356
Wait, so Gabriel was something
that I made up?

57:40.457 --> 57:42.859
Whatever you went through
before you joined our family,

57:42.959 --> 57:46.796
it hurt you in a way
that I can't even imagine.

57:46.863 --> 57:49.365
I always figured
you created Gabriel

57:49.466 --> 57:51.768
so that you could
survive that.

57:51.835 --> 57:54.871
We thought if we
gave you enough love,

57:54.971 --> 57:57.373
you wouldn't need him anymore.

58:00.310 --> 58:02.378
I hope we weren't wrong.

58:28.538 --> 58:29.739
E. May...

58:40.216 --> 58:43.720
Thursday, July 23rd, 1992.

58:43.820 --> 58:45.388
Today marks the seventh year

58:45.488 --> 58:48.424
since Emily May
was entrusted into our care.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.426
She remains unlike
any test subject

58:50.527 --> 58:53.096
we have ever encountered
here at the clinic.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.898
Though in recent months,
Emily started

58:54.998 --> 58:57.367
exhibiting signs
of mental psychosis.

58:57.433 --> 58:59.335
She says she's seeing visions,

58:59.402 --> 59:02.572
and hearing thoughts
from the Devil.

59:02.672 --> 59:06.109
I've contacted Dr. John
Gregory out at Hopkins

59:06.209 --> 59:07.610
as well as Dr. Victor Fields

59:07.710 --> 59:09.345
from the Los Angeles
Children's Hospital,

59:09.412 --> 59:12.615
just to help determine
a course of action.

59:15.018 --> 59:17.954
Dr. Florence Weaver.
Dr. Victor Fields.

59:18.054 --> 59:19.455
Working the same case

59:19.556 --> 59:22.058
along with Dr. John Gregory.

59:22.125 --> 59:23.259
Holy shit.

59:58.761 --> 1:00:01.230
-

1:00:26.589 --> 1:00:30.360
Dr. Gregory?
This is Seattle PD.

1:00:37.266 --> 1:00:39.135
I need you to answer me.

1:01:08.698 --> 1:01:12.635
Detective!
He's still here.

1:01:13.870 --> 1:01:15.405
He's still here.

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:16.973
Oh, Jesus.

1:01:25.014 --> 1:01:27.050
-

1:02:07.390 --> 1:02:09.358
Holy shit.

1:02:31.214 --> 1:02:33.249
I gotta be
out of my mind.

1:03:58.634 --> 1:04:00.203
Stop!
-

1:05:24.787 --> 1:05:26.656
-

1:05:49.345 --> 1:05:50.613
Fuck me.

1:06:01.324 --> 1:06:02.792
All three victims
were involved

1:06:02.858 --> 1:06:05.328
in the same case study
they called  Patient May.

1:06:05.428 --> 1:06:08.597
You were the case study.
They were your doctors.

1:06:10.366 --> 1:06:11.767
Uh, I'm sorry.

1:06:11.834 --> 1:06:15.104
It's all blank before
Sydney's parents adopted me.

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:20.009
I think you were
born Emily May.

1:06:25.548 --> 1:06:27.316
That's what he calls me.

1:06:29.118 --> 1:06:30.353
Madison,

1:06:30.453 --> 1:06:32.388
the department works
with a hypnotherapist

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:34.457
that helps unlock
repressed memories.

1:06:34.523 --> 1:06:37.893
Trauma, sexual abuse, PTSD.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:39.895
Would you be willing
to see one?

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.230
I knew it.

1:06:41.330 --> 1:06:43.833
She's not a psychic,
God damn it.

1:06:47.870 --> 1:06:50.239
We are gonna
turn back the hands of time.

1:06:50.339 --> 1:06:53.576
The bygone years
reconstructing themselves.

1:06:53.676 --> 1:06:56.345
I want you to go back
to before the adoption.

1:06:56.412 --> 1:06:58.914
I think I'm in a hospital.

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:02.585
But I don't remember
any of it.

1:07:02.685 --> 1:07:03.819
Okay, you've gone back

1:07:03.886 --> 1:07:05.321
beyond your
conscious memories.

1:07:05.388 --> 1:07:08.224
Can you tell us why
you're in the hospital?

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.397
I'm not sure.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:20.236
But I'm better now.

1:07:20.336 --> 1:07:23.172
That's why
they're here for me.

1:07:23.239 --> 1:07:26.175
Who?
- My new parents.

1:07:27.843 --> 1:07:30.513
They've come to take me
to my new home.

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:32.748
It's nice.

1:07:36.719 --> 1:07:38.254
But he's here too.

1:07:44.293 --> 1:07:45.294
Gabriel.

1:07:49.632 --> 1:07:52.301
He followed me home
from the hospital.

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:56.572
Who is Gabriel?
Is he a friend?

1:07:56.639 --> 1:08:01.410
He says he is, but I'm the
only one that can see him.

1:08:01.477 --> 1:08:02.812
You ruined
your mother's cake.

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:04.914
-I didn't, it was Gabriel.
-Stop.

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:06.882
You can't keep lying
like this, Maddy.

1:08:06.949 --> 1:08:09.118
-I'm not lying.
-There's no Gabriel.

1:08:09.218 --> 1:08:12.721
Go to your room. Madison,
go to your room right now.

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:17.827
So when
he does something bad,

1:08:17.927 --> 1:08:20.563
I'm the one
that gets in trouble.

1:08:30.139 --> 1:08:31.807
-

1:08:35.578 --> 1:08:36.745
Go away.

1:08:41.417 --> 1:08:42.485
What?

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:47.957
But she's sleeping.

1:08:54.330 --> 1:08:55.631
I guess.

1:08:58.267 --> 1:09:02.138
Really? You mean
like a good surprise?

1:09:22.124 --> 1:09:23.492
Cut it.

1:09:28.464 --> 1:09:33.002
A nice slice of cake for Mom.

1:10:00.529 --> 1:10:01.430
Madison!

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:02.831
Cut her!

1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:08.237
No,
it wasn't me! It was Gabriel!

1:10:08.337 --> 1:10:11.707
Please! No, no!

1:10:11.774 --> 1:10:13.209
Please believe me!

1:10:13.909 --> 1:10:14.944
Please!

1:10:16.278 --> 1:10:18.280
Stop this. Stop this.
Stop this!

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:20.716
Get her out, get her out!
Get her out!

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:24.119
-Stop this. Stop this.
- Beverly...

1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:25.788
-Beverly!
-Get her out right now!

1:10:25.888 --> 1:10:28.390
When I touch your forehead,
you will be back with us.

1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:33.462
-Hey. Okay?

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:36.932
-Maddy?
-

1:10:37.032 --> 1:10:38.033
Jesus.

1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:39.935
Are you okay?

1:10:40.035 --> 1:10:41.770
I remember now.

1:10:45.274 --> 1:10:47.643
It's happened before,

1:10:47.743 --> 1:10:49.878
waking up in strange places,

1:10:50.879 --> 1:10:52.381
seeing things.

1:10:56.252 --> 1:11:00.222
I don't know how,
but Gabriel wanted to...

1:11:07.096 --> 1:11:08.664
What did he want, Madison?

1:11:11.133 --> 1:11:13.469
To hurt the baby.

1:11:15.104 --> 1:11:19.008
It's as if he knew
that with you here...

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:22.945
I wouldn't need him anymore.

1:11:25.581 --> 1:11:27.182
And he was right.

1:11:28.150 --> 1:11:30.286
He became a lost memory,

1:11:30.352 --> 1:11:32.988
buried deep in the back
of my head...

1:11:34.790 --> 1:11:36.091
until now.

1:11:40.429 --> 1:11:42.831
The killer said
he was Gabriel.

1:11:44.833 --> 1:11:47.202
My Gabriel.

1:11:50.439 --> 1:11:53.609
Wait, are you saying
that the killer is

1:11:54.510 --> 1:11:56.545
your imaginary friend?

1:13:11.186 --> 1:13:12.187
Whoa!

1:13:12.721 --> 1:13:13.722
Fuck!

1:13:50.159 --> 1:13:51.894
Everything's
gonna be okay.

1:13:53.295 --> 1:13:56.064
Maddy? Maddy, listen.

1:13:59.968 --> 1:14:02.571
Wait. Please.

1:14:03.906 --> 1:14:06.508
Detective, wait. Please.

1:14:06.608 --> 1:14:07.810
I don't know what's going on,

1:14:07.910 --> 1:14:09.511
but Maddy couldn't
have done this.

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:10.979
You can't come back in here.
This is a crime scene now.

1:14:11.079 --> 1:14:12.481
-Please just listen to me.
-No, you listen.

1:14:12.581 --> 1:14:14.082
Back off,
or I'm gonna charge you

1:14:14.149 --> 1:14:15.451
with being an accomplice.

1:14:18.420 --> 1:14:19.421
Please.

1:14:21.757 --> 1:14:24.092
Hey, you guys gotta see this.

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:44.112
This is what he kills with.

1:14:44.179 --> 1:14:45.781
It's the rest of
the missing trophy,

1:14:45.848 --> 1:14:48.116
fashioned into a weapon.

1:14:49.985 --> 1:14:53.121
I told you, from day one.

1:14:58.894 --> 1:15:02.564
You got the murder weapon,
the coat, the gloves,

1:15:02.664 --> 1:15:05.667
and Jeffrey Dahmer's workshop
in your attic.

1:15:05.734 --> 1:15:07.369
It's over, Madison.

1:15:07.469 --> 1:15:09.905
It was... It was Gabriel.

1:15:10.005 --> 1:15:13.408
He got into my house.
He's done it before.

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.843
Enough with
the bogeyman story.

1:15:14.910 --> 1:15:16.712
Please, Kekoa. Please.

1:15:16.812 --> 1:15:18.146
You've seen him.

1:15:18.213 --> 1:15:19.748
You know that it's not me.

1:15:19.848 --> 1:15:22.851
-Who is the woman, Madison?
-I don't know.

1:15:22.918 --> 1:15:25.087
Gabriel must have snuck her
into my house.

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:26.989
Let me
tell you what I think.

1:15:27.055 --> 1:15:29.324
You were sick in the head
when you were young.

1:15:29.391 --> 1:15:33.428
Those doctors helped you.
It worked for a while.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:35.063
But now your sickness is back

1:15:35.163 --> 1:15:37.833
and you blame them
for fucking you up.

1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:40.335
- No. No.

1:15:40.402 --> 1:15:42.905
It's not me.

1:15:43.005 --> 1:15:44.106
Stop lying to us.

1:15:44.206 --> 1:15:45.741
I'm telling the fucking truth!

1:15:50.078 --> 1:15:51.246
Shit!

1:16:03.258 --> 1:16:05.594
He wants to talk to you.

1:16:09.731 --> 1:16:11.967
You have got to be kidding me.

1:16:20.042 --> 1:16:21.643
This is Detective Shaw.

1:16:29.117 --> 1:16:33.155
Hello, Detective.

1:16:33.255 --> 1:16:34.756
Who am I talking to?

1:16:36.258 --> 1:16:40.495
You know who I am.
You found me.

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:43.665
I didn't find you soon enough.

1:16:43.765 --> 1:16:48.670
But you found my things.
I want them back.

1:16:48.770 --> 1:16:50.973
Why was your stuff
in her attic, hmm?

1:16:52.107 --> 1:16:54.943
You trying to incriminate her?

1:16:55.010 --> 1:17:00.282
Dumb bitch didn't even know
I was nesting in her home.

1:17:00.349 --> 1:17:02.484
Is all this personal?

1:17:02.584 --> 1:17:07.289
If my blade had punched a hole
in your face last night,

1:17:07.356 --> 1:17:09.992
would that have been personal?

1:17:11.927 --> 1:17:13.829
Who are you, Gabriel?

1:17:13.929 --> 1:17:17.866
Oh, I thought she had
already told you.

1:17:17.966 --> 1:17:21.003
I'm a figment
of her imagination.

1:17:27.709 --> 1:17:31.546
Ask her what
she used to call me.

1:17:36.485 --> 1:17:38.353
The Devil.

1:17:45.327 --> 1:17:49.798
You see, Syd? That's why
we never throw anything out.

1:17:49.865 --> 1:17:54.836
You never know when something
would come in handy.

1:17:55.904 --> 1:17:57.239
Here.

1:17:57.339 --> 1:17:58.740
Yes, we had an Emily May.

1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:00.342
She was remanded to our care

1:18:00.409 --> 1:18:02.177
by the Simion
Research Hospital.

1:18:02.244 --> 1:18:04.312
It says here they've been
shuttered since the 90s.

1:18:04.379 --> 1:18:06.314
So it's just been
sitting there empty?

1:18:06.381 --> 1:18:09.151
Sorry, I don't know.
That was before my time.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:21.930
Whoa.

1:19:22.290 --> 1:19:24.059
-

1:20:01.263 --> 1:20:05.000
Records storage.
Basement Level.

1:20:06.168 --> 1:20:07.702
Of course.

1:20:13.141 --> 1:20:16.978
Please, Officer. Officer!
I'm not supposed to be here!

1:20:17.045 --> 1:20:19.481
I haven't done anything wrong!

1:20:19.548 --> 1:20:22.717
I am not supposed to be here,
God damn it!

1:20:23.652 --> 1:20:25.720
They made a mistake.

1:20:25.821 --> 1:20:27.455
-

1:20:51.346 --> 1:20:53.715
-Princess.

1:21:20.609 --> 1:21:21.877
Emily May.

1:21:33.054 --> 1:21:36.224
"...the result
of an absorption in utero,

1:21:36.291 --> 1:21:39.060
"growing in sync
with patient..."

1:22:02.450 --> 1:22:04.653
Today, we'll be speaking
to the subjects' mother,

1:22:04.753 --> 1:22:05.921
Serena May.

1:22:05.987 --> 1:22:07.455
15 years of age.

1:22:07.555 --> 1:22:09.925
Poor girl was raped and
carried her pregnancy to term.

1:22:09.991 --> 1:22:13.061
She's decided to entrust
her children to our care.

1:22:13.128 --> 1:22:15.497
This could be
a phenomenal opportunity

1:22:15.597 --> 1:22:17.098
to further our research.

1:22:19.734 --> 1:22:24.272
Now, are you sure
you want to do this, Serena?

1:22:25.807 --> 1:22:28.910
It's okay,
there's no judgment here.

1:22:31.613 --> 1:22:33.481
Mama won't help me.

1:22:35.350 --> 1:22:39.587
She called my pregnancy
a transgression against God.

1:22:39.654 --> 1:22:42.657
I don't know how to look
after them on my own.

1:22:46.795 --> 1:22:48.630
He's an abomination.

1:22:51.132 --> 1:22:53.668
I don't know what else
to do, Doctor.

1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:00.942
Please look after Emily.

1:23:01.009 --> 1:23:03.345
Don't worry.
You can have peace of mind

1:23:03.445 --> 1:23:04.946
knowing we'll provide
the best medical care.

1:23:05.013 --> 1:23:08.316
They told me that she died
while giving birth.

1:23:08.383 --> 1:23:11.553
Those lying cock-knockers.

1:23:11.653 --> 1:23:13.054
Now,
we're just going to need you

1:23:13.154 --> 1:23:15.790
and your mother
to sign some paperwork.

1:23:36.344 --> 1:23:37.846
When will she wake up?

1:23:37.912 --> 1:23:41.049
She's in a coma, Detective.
It's in God's hands.

1:23:41.149 --> 1:23:44.586
Hey, you were right
about the Underground.

1:23:44.686 --> 1:23:47.922
Jane Doe was a tour guide
down there.

1:23:48.023 --> 1:23:49.424
Employee of the Month.

1:23:53.094 --> 1:23:54.829
Serena May.

1:23:56.564 --> 1:23:58.400
This is Madison's
birth mother.

1:24:12.847 --> 1:24:15.550
Emily, are you okay?

1:24:19.687 --> 1:24:21.222
Are you scared?

1:24:23.525 --> 1:24:26.294
Well, don't be.
He won't wake up, I promise.

1:24:26.394 --> 1:24:27.962
I've given him
a heavy sedative.

1:24:28.063 --> 1:24:31.399
It's probably why
you're feeling sleepy too.

1:24:31.466 --> 1:24:33.802
We just wanted
a private moment with you

1:24:33.902 --> 1:24:36.271
without Gabriel listening in.

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:46.648
We've noticed in recent weeks
you've become more aggressive.

1:24:47.482 --> 1:24:49.451
Can you tell us why?

1:24:53.288 --> 1:24:55.824
He's been telling me
to do things.

1:24:56.958 --> 1:25:00.495
Bad things.
To hurt people.

1:25:00.595 --> 1:25:03.064
Is that why
you attacked Bobby Fey?

1:25:06.134 --> 1:25:08.803
But Bobby's twice your size.

1:25:12.574 --> 1:25:14.943
Gabriel makes me strong.

1:25:18.646 --> 1:25:20.482
He told me to kill Bobby.

1:25:22.650 --> 1:25:24.986
He actually
said those words?

1:25:28.323 --> 1:25:32.360
Sometimes he speaks words...

1:25:33.828 --> 1:25:37.532
and other times,
the words are in my head.

1:25:39.767 --> 1:25:41.269
And then...

1:25:43.638 --> 1:25:46.174
Then they aren't
really words anymore.

1:25:47.675 --> 1:25:49.978
Just feelings.

1:25:52.147 --> 1:25:54.682
But I knew what
he wanted me to do.

1:25:59.154 --> 1:26:01.122
He pretends to be nice.

1:26:03.691 --> 1:26:05.894
But he's the Devil.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:10.331
Okay.

1:26:15.069 --> 1:26:16.704
I'm going to wake him up.

1:26:16.804 --> 1:26:20.642
Why don't you come around
after I've injected him?

1:26:26.247 --> 1:26:28.583
-

1:26:30.151 --> 1:26:32.754
-

1:26:35.390 --> 1:26:36.858
-Oh, my God!

1:26:36.925 --> 1:26:38.593
Oh, God!

1:26:38.693 --> 1:26:39.761
Oh, my God! Maddy!

1:26:41.763 --> 1:26:44.365
So what exactly is Gabriel?

1:26:44.432 --> 1:26:48.436
Gabriel is an extreme version
of a teratoma.

1:26:48.536 --> 1:26:51.439
A tumor consisting of tissues,
hair, teeth, muscles, bones.

1:26:51.539 --> 1:26:53.675
But more specifically,
in this case,

1:26:53.741 --> 1:26:56.878
it's a parasitic twin.

1:26:56.945 --> 1:26:58.947
When two embryos
develop in the womb

1:26:59.047 --> 1:27:00.882
don't separate
like they should,

1:27:00.949 --> 1:27:02.217
one twin is dominant,

1:27:02.283 --> 1:27:03.751
while the other
is underdeveloped.

1:27:03.851 --> 1:27:05.019
It's not considered conjoined

1:27:05.086 --> 1:27:06.554
because
the underdeveloped twin

1:27:06.621 --> 1:27:08.122
is dependent on the body
of the other.

1:27:08.223 --> 1:27:13.595
Like a parasite,
Gabriel feeds off Emily.

1:27:13.695 --> 1:27:15.530
What's the matter,
Pollyanna?

1:27:15.597 --> 1:27:18.199
You get lost on the way
to the country club?

1:27:27.742 --> 1:27:29.310
Look, I don't
want any trouble.

1:27:29.410 --> 1:27:31.279
I don't give a fuck
what you want.

1:27:40.722 --> 1:27:42.090
An apple.

1:27:44.392 --> 1:27:46.094
Pig.

1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:47.495
A teddy bear.

1:27:47.595 --> 1:27:49.330
We're starting to suspect
that Gabriel

1:27:49.430 --> 1:27:51.432
can somehow access
the region to the brain

1:27:51.499 --> 1:27:53.668
that process visual stimuli,

1:27:53.768 --> 1:27:56.738
and make Emily see
what he wants her to see.

1:27:56.804 --> 1:27:58.640
This would explain
her recent claims

1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:03.077
of hallucinations
and waking dreams.

1:28:04.612 --> 1:28:06.180
What the fuck
did you do to get in here?

1:28:06.281 --> 1:28:08.082
Forget to separate
the recycling?

1:28:09.450 --> 1:28:12.453
But I'm willing to play nice
for a price.

1:28:14.289 --> 1:28:15.923
What you got?

1:28:15.990 --> 1:28:17.859
Guard!

1:28:17.959 --> 1:28:18.960
No! No!

1:28:23.298 --> 1:28:24.332
Bitch.

1:28:25.667 --> 1:28:28.002
-

1:28:34.976 --> 1:28:37.378
-

1:28:37.478 --> 1:28:38.980
Gabriel, stop it.

1:28:59.701 --> 1:29:01.703
-What the fuck?

1:29:04.172 --> 1:29:05.340
Oh, shit.

1:29:05.406 --> 1:29:06.908
Yo, this bitch
is having a seizure.

1:29:07.008 --> 1:29:08.876
Because they literally
share the same brain,

1:29:08.976 --> 1:29:10.678
I think he's able
to trick her mind

1:29:10.745 --> 1:29:13.181
and make her think she's
living her life as usual.

1:29:13.247 --> 1:29:17.085
Essentially, placing her
in a mental prison.

1:29:17.185 --> 1:29:18.753
When in reality,

1:29:18.853 --> 1:29:22.557
Gabriel has hijacked her body
and is using it himself.

1:29:27.862 --> 1:29:31.199
It's time to cut out
the cancer.

1:29:31.265 --> 1:29:34.235
Gabriel's parasitic nature
has increased significantly

1:29:34.335 --> 1:29:37.071
as he's now siphoning
more fluids and nutrients,

1:29:37.171 --> 1:29:38.906
resulting in severe
weight loss.

1:29:39.006 --> 1:29:41.209
So Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory,
and myself have concluded,

1:29:41.275 --> 1:29:45.713
the only way to save Emily
is to excise the teratoma.

1:29:45.780 --> 1:29:48.516
Now, Gabriel is conjoined
at the brain,

1:29:49.784 --> 1:29:51.953
so full removal
could kill Emily

1:29:52.053 --> 1:29:54.389
or result in permanent
brain damage.

1:29:54.455 --> 1:29:57.625
Course of action would be
to remove what we can

1:29:57.725 --> 1:30:00.395
and suppress the rest
into her skull.

1:30:01.963 --> 1:30:03.464
Let's close her up.

1:30:26.087 --> 1:30:28.456
-

1:30:38.099 --> 1:30:39.600
What the fuck?

1:30:51.145 --> 1:30:53.080
Holy shit! Oh, God damn!

1:30:57.518 --> 1:30:59.787
-

1:31:33.821 --> 1:31:34.956
Get me outta here!

1:31:36.123 --> 1:31:38.125
Guard!
Get the motherfuckin' guard!

1:31:42.830 --> 1:31:45.166
-Guard!

1:31:46.667 --> 1:31:49.537
Hey! Open
the motherfuckin' door!

1:31:51.539 --> 1:31:53.007
No!

1:31:56.010 --> 1:31:57.712
Holy shit! Hey!

1:32:27.575 --> 1:32:28.876
Keh? Listen.

1:32:28.943 --> 1:32:31.178
Gabriel is inside of Madison.

1:32:31.245 --> 1:32:32.680
He's been using her
this whole time.

1:32:32.747 --> 1:32:35.716
He's been controlling her body
like a puppet.

1:32:35.783 --> 1:32:37.685
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sydney, slow down.

1:32:37.752 --> 1:32:39.053
You're not making any sense.

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:40.388
I found
Madison's history.

1:32:40.454 --> 1:32:42.456
She was born
with a parasitic twin.

1:32:42.557 --> 1:32:45.726
Gabriel has been dormant
all of these years.

1:32:45.793 --> 1:32:47.061
When Derek smashed
Madison's head

1:32:47.128 --> 1:32:48.729
against the wall,
it woke Gabriel up.

1:32:48.796 --> 1:32:50.097
-Bitch!
-

1:32:50.197 --> 1:32:52.800
Jeez, Sydney, that's insane.

1:32:52.900 --> 1:32:55.536
Madison's birth mother is
still alive, Keh. They lied.

1:32:55.603 --> 1:32:56.904
I know. She's the woman

1:32:56.971 --> 1:32:58.472
who fell out
of Madison's attic.

1:32:58.573 --> 1:32:59.974
We sent her
to Seattle Medical.

1:33:00.074 --> 1:33:01.642
Are you kidding me?
We have to talk to her.

1:33:01.742 --> 1:33:03.978
She's the only person
left alive who knows anything.

1:33:18.426 --> 1:33:20.795
-

1:33:29.437 --> 1:33:31.238
It's in the stairs, quick!

1:33:32.773 --> 1:33:34.675
-

1:33:36.410 --> 1:33:38.679
-

1:33:38.779 --> 1:33:40.481
-It's coming from inside.
- Shit.

1:33:40.581 --> 1:33:42.016
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1:33:43.451 --> 1:33:45.820
Keh? Keh?

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:47.121
Fuck.

1:33:47.188 --> 1:33:49.857
-

1:34:59.326 --> 1:35:00.895
Oh, God.

1:36:04.892 --> 1:36:06.594
Shit! We're getting shot at!

1:36:09.964 --> 1:36:11.065
Stay back.

1:36:28.783 --> 1:36:29.984
We need backup.

1:36:30.084 --> 1:36:31.752
Send the National
fucking Guard!

1:36:49.436 --> 1:36:50.437
Madison!

1:37:08.322 --> 1:37:09.990
Madison!

1:37:17.631 --> 1:37:19.233
Get off him, motherfucker!

1:37:25.005 --> 1:37:26.907
Fuck!

1:37:41.856 --> 1:37:43.090
Oh, my God.

1:37:43.190 --> 1:37:45.059
Okay. Fuck.

1:37:50.197 --> 1:37:52.099
Told you not to get
your ass kicked.

1:37:52.199 --> 1:37:54.101
- Okay.

1:38:50.591 --> 1:38:51.825
-Regina.
-

1:38:51.926 --> 1:38:53.494
Oh, my God, Kekoa!

1:38:58.766 --> 1:39:00.067
Why am I calling the police?

1:39:00.134 --> 1:39:02.836
Call paramedics. Now!

1:39:03.938 --> 1:39:04.939
Oh, Reg...

1:39:07.775 --> 1:39:08.842
Oh, my God.

1:39:08.943 --> 1:39:12.646
The mother,
she's going for her.

1:39:12.746 --> 1:39:15.516
The hospital. You gotta go.

1:39:15.616 --> 1:39:18.686
I'll stay with her. It's okay.
Paramedics are on the way.

1:39:18.786 --> 1:39:21.455
I'll be fine. Now go stop him.

1:39:21.522 --> 1:39:22.589
Go!

1:39:32.533 --> 1:39:34.134
Sorry, ma'am,
this area is restricted.

1:39:34.201 --> 1:39:35.636
Right, I know, Officer,

1:39:35.703 --> 1:39:37.972
but if you could just call
Detective Kekoa Shaw,

1:39:38.038 --> 1:39:39.273
then he can fill you in,

1:39:39.340 --> 1:39:40.641
and just tell him
that Sydney Lake is here.

1:39:40.708 --> 1:39:42.343
I'm sorry.
Nobody is allowed in here.

1:39:42.443 --> 1:39:45.279
I cannot let you by unless
Detective Shaw is here with...

1:39:47.982 --> 1:39:50.784
-What's wrong? Are you okay?
-

1:39:50.851 --> 1:39:53.454
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:55.856
Are you having a heart attack?

1:39:55.956 --> 1:39:58.492
-My pacemaker.
-Okay.

1:39:58.559 --> 1:40:00.060
-It's burning.
-

1:40:02.663 --> 1:40:04.498
-Please go get help.
-Okay.

1:40:04.565 --> 1:40:05.799
-

1:40:18.345 --> 1:40:19.580
Sydney!

1:40:22.316 --> 1:40:24.218
I was
saving you for last.

1:40:31.325 --> 1:40:32.693
She chose you...

1:40:33.861 --> 1:40:35.429
...over me.

1:40:35.529 --> 1:40:37.564
Her own flesh and blood.

1:40:37.664 --> 1:40:40.601
I should have killed you
before you were born!

1:40:41.869 --> 1:40:42.936
Gabriel, no!

1:40:44.405 --> 1:40:46.273
Gabriel.

1:40:50.411 --> 1:40:52.946
Please forgive me.

1:40:56.850 --> 1:40:59.920
I should never have
given you away.

1:41:04.358 --> 1:41:06.193
You were my son.

1:41:07.628 --> 1:41:11.298
And I should have loved you
no matter what.

1:41:21.408 --> 1:41:23.310
- Emily!

1:41:23.410 --> 1:41:25.446
No! No! No!
You're hurting her!

1:41:25.546 --> 1:41:27.281
-Sydney, get outta here!

1:41:28.382 --> 1:41:29.650
-

1:41:39.426 --> 1:41:40.494
Go on.

1:41:40.594 --> 1:41:41.995
-Madison?
-  Shoot me!

1:41:42.096 --> 1:41:44.331
Madison, I know
you're in there.

1:41:44.431 --> 1:41:46.066
And kill her.

1:41:46.133 --> 1:41:47.634
What did you do to my sister?

1:41:47.734 --> 1:41:50.237
She's not your sister!

1:41:52.473 --> 1:41:53.640
Sydney!

1:41:58.946 --> 1:42:00.948
-Maddy, please.

1:42:01.014 --> 1:42:02.516
She can't hear you.

1:42:02.616 --> 1:42:06.253
Maddy, I know you can hear me.
You have to fight him.

1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:07.621
Madison's not home.

1:42:07.688 --> 1:42:09.790
Madison,
he killed your babies.

1:42:09.857 --> 1:42:12.159
He was the cause
of your miscarriages.

1:42:12.259 --> 1:42:14.595
He was feeding off
of your fetuses

1:42:14.661 --> 1:42:17.164
to build himself back up.

1:42:17.264 --> 1:42:20.033
Maddy, please,
please come back.

1:42:40.154 --> 1:42:42.322
Goodbye, sis.

1:42:42.389 --> 1:42:43.690
Gabriel, no!

1:42:43.790 --> 1:42:46.326
-

1:42:50.497 --> 1:42:52.566
I wanted
you to see...

1:42:52.666 --> 1:42:54.401
No, Gabriel. Please.

1:42:54.501 --> 1:42:56.537
...what you made me.

1:42:56.637 --> 1:42:58.172
I'm so sorry.

1:43:14.988 --> 1:43:17.591
A monster.

1:43:19.193 --> 1:43:20.527
No, Gabriel.

1:43:20.594 --> 1:43:22.763
You were always a monster.

1:43:25.866 --> 1:43:27.067
What?

1:43:28.168 --> 1:43:30.370
What's happening?

1:43:30.437 --> 1:43:31.705
Madison...

1:43:43.383 --> 1:43:46.887
Now, I can do
all the mind tricks you can.

1:43:52.125 --> 1:43:53.727
No.

1:43:53.794 --> 1:43:55.862
Not possible!

1:43:55.929 --> 1:44:00.534
Did you forget
we share the same brain?

1:44:03.237 --> 1:44:06.306
I didn't ask
to be tethered to you.

1:44:06.406 --> 1:44:09.042
You don't deserve your body.

1:44:09.109 --> 1:44:10.911
I can use it better than you.

1:44:11.745 --> 1:44:14.114
Not anymore.

1:44:14.214 --> 1:44:17.484
You don't get to control me
ever again.

1:44:19.119 --> 1:44:21.255
It's over, Gabriel.

1:44:21.321 --> 1:44:22.990
I'm taking it all back.

1:44:23.090 --> 1:44:28.161
My mind, my body,
my everything.

1:44:28.262 --> 1:44:32.299
Now, you get to live
in a world that I create.

1:44:38.238 --> 1:44:40.507
You can't lock me
in here forever.

1:44:40.607 --> 1:44:42.676
You'll always be stuck
with me.

1:44:42.776 --> 1:44:44.611
Sooner or later
I will get out.

1:44:44.678 --> 1:44:49.483
I know, but next time
I'll be ready for you.

1:45:05.866 --> 1:45:08.201
-

1:45:21.982 --> 1:45:22.983
Maddy?

1:45:27.154 --> 1:45:29.389
Maddy? Is that you?

1:45:29.489 --> 1:45:32.459
Sydney, I'm so sorry.

1:45:32.526 --> 1:45:33.994
I'm gonna lift this off you.

1:45:34.061 --> 1:45:35.562
No, it's too heavy.

1:45:35.662 --> 1:45:38.165
It was always my body.

1:45:38.231 --> 1:45:43.003
If he was strong enough
to do this, then so am I.

1:45:54.881 --> 1:45:57.217
Hey. Hey.

1:45:57.317 --> 1:45:59.586
Hey, stay with me. Hey.

1:45:59.686 --> 1:46:01.588
Hey, look at me. Hey.

1:46:21.074 --> 1:46:23.710
All my life, I've yearned

1:46:23.777 --> 1:46:27.180
for a blood connection
with someone.

1:46:27.247 --> 1:46:31.685
Yet in the end, it was right
in front of me all along.

1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:39.059
Blood or not, you will
always be my sister.

1:46:41.561 --> 1:46:44.865
And I will always love you.
