05:25.380 --> 05:26.293
- Saturday night?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.543
I'm sorry, I already have plans.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.530
But maybe some other time.

05:32.530 --> 05:34.119

05:34.119 --> 05:34.952
You know, it's our first gig

05:46.340 --> 05:47.490
- I have a date.

05:47.490 --> 05:50.570

you were dating somebody.

05:50.570 --> 05:53.320

05:53.320 --> 05:54.800
We met online.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.470
- Okay, well.

05:56.470 --> 05:58.230
Have fun, be safe.

You know, you never
know about these people

05:59.800 --> 06:01.553
that you meet online, it's ...

06:27.775 --> 06:28.799

07:24.485 --> 07:26.120
- Oh, the usual.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.190
Making the clients happy.

07:28.190 --> 07:29.670
- Even if they're assholes
and they don't know

07:29.670 --> 07:30.503
what they want.

07:31.954 --> 07:34.292
- [Female] So, you going out this weekend?

07:34.292 --> 07:36.180

07:37.735 --> 07:38.650
What you got going on?

07:38.650 --> 07:39.870

08:22.090 --> 08:24.093
Are you doing anything tonight?

08:25.990 --> 08:28.890
- Yeah, my parents are
coming over tonight.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.110
I'm cooking dinner for 'em.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.640
- Okay, yeah.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.610
I'll take a rain check on that then.

10:30.085 --> 10:32.470
And some grandchildren
wouldn't be too bad either.

10:32.470 --> 10:34.093
- I'm trying to date, okay?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.540
- Honey, we only want you to be happy.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.760
- Hey mom, you remember
the time we went camping

10:41.760 --> 10:44.220
and dad forgot the tent and
we got rained out all day.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.530
Remember that?

10:45.530 --> 10:47.290
Yeah, it was a fun day.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.490
I wish we could go back.

10:51.490 --> 10:52.690
All done?

10:52.690 --> 10:53.890
What do you guys think?

10:53.890 --> 10:55.647

13:15.550 --> 13:16.470

13:16.470 --> 13:18.930
I guess I'm a little old fashioned.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.480
- Okay.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.540
Hi.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.590

15:08.800 --> 15:09.633
Hey.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.410
Yeah, you gotta go.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.960
- [Female] What happened last night?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.010
- You don't remember.

15:21.790 --> 15:25.410
I mean, you were coming on
to me pretty hard at the bar.

15:25.410 --> 15:28.792
You got really drunk
so I brought you here.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.492
Trying to make sure you were okay.

15:31.650 --> 15:32.810
- Did we have sex?

15:32.810 --> 15:34.800
- Uh, yeah.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.413
But don't worry.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.013
Hey.

16:17.150 --> 16:17.983

16:20.490 --> 16:21.790
See you around, all right?

16:23.050 --> 16:23.893
I'll call you.

16:25.912 --> 16:26.745
I really won't.

16:28.110 --> 16:28.943
Anyway.

16:38.850 --> 16:39.750
Hey Nicole.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.270
It's me, John.

16:41.270 --> 16:42.430
You know, you look so much better

16:42.430 --> 16:44.560
than your profile picture.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.970
Looking good, it's nice to
finally meet you in person.

16:46.970 --> 16:49.180
You slick fucking rascal you.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.130
Let me tell you something.

16:50.130 --> 16:52.590
I ain't gay but you, you,

16:52.590 --> 16:55.540

16:55.540 --> 16:56.463
You know that.

17:08.211 --> 17:09.423
That's good money right there.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.313
Game time.

17:19.152 --> 17:21.819
(phone ringing)

17:24.839 --> 17:26.563
Hey mom, how are you?

17:29.830 --> 17:31.790
Yes mom, I'm still single.

17:31.790 --> 17:33.120
You know if I had a girlfriend,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.610
I would definitely let you know.

17:34.610 --> 17:36.360
You'd be the first one to find out.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.520
No, mother, I don't know when I'm going

17:39.520 --> 17:43.380
to get married so can you
please just stop asking me that?

17:43.380 --> 17:45.409
Work is fine, work is great.

17:45.409 --> 17:47.160
Would you, ma, I'm getting dressed.

18:32.902 --> 18:33.735
- Hello.

18:33.735 --> 18:35.020

18:35.020 --> 18:36.944
I'm at the restaurant.

18:36.944 --> 18:38.298
You here?

18:38.298 --> 18:41.231
- Yeah, give me like 10 minutes.

18:41.231 --> 18:42.415
- [John] I'll be at the bar.

18:42.415 --> 18:44.221
(mumbling) waiting on you.

18:44.221 --> 18:46.804
(upbeat music)

19:10.141 --> 19:12.724
(horn honking)

19:32.090 --> 19:34.343

19:51.320 --> 19:52.623
Okay, well here we go.

19:54.980 --> 19:55.813
- Thanks.

19:58.570 --> 20:00.040
- And also, pretty girl, don't be

20:00.040 --> 20:01.890

20:03.330 --> 20:04.913
May the Lord be with you.

20:38.390 --> 20:39.343
- So don't tell me.

20:40.450 --> 20:41.283
You're Nicole.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.320
- [Nicole] I'm sorry, I was running--

20:43.320 --> 20:44.170
- Are you really?

20:49.510 --> 20:50.790
No, I'm just playing with you.

20:50.790 --> 20:52.340
Hey, I'm John.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.873
Glad you could make it, Nicole.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.910
- Thanks for waiting.

20:57.910 --> 20:59.060
- [John] Thanks for showing up.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.668
Could've been a lot worse.

21:00.668 --> 21:01.850
(mumbling)

21:01.850 --> 21:03.450
- Does that happen to you a lot?

21:04.670 --> 21:06.803
- Well, you know, it's just a little bit,

21:08.080 --> 21:10.330
did you wanna get a
table first before we ...

21:12.040 --> 21:14.807
- No, I'm good here at the bar.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.640
- Really?

21:17.159 --> 21:18.600
All right, cool.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.860
So enough about me.

21:20.860 --> 21:21.810
Where are you from?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.440
- Here.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.290
- Okay.

21:26.290 --> 21:28.651
Native, okay, that's what's up.

21:28.651 --> 21:30.193
Do your parents still live here?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.323
- I don't really wanna
talk about my family.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.650
- Sorry, my bad.

21:37.650 --> 21:40.500
Well, my parents, they
annoy the shit out of me.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.430
My mom, she stays down the way.

21:50.210 --> 21:51.043
- So.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.690
Do you come here often?

21:54.690 --> 21:56.420
- Yeah, I love it here.

21:56.420 --> 21:57.973
Small crowds.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.773
Nice people.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.980
And the music's not too loud.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.460
What do I look like, trying to yell

22:05.460 --> 22:08.783
across a table to my date
while we have something to eat.

22:15.850 --> 22:18.010
I had to let you know that, man,

22:18.010 --> 22:20.540
you look beautiful.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.590
So much better than your profile picture.

22:24.060 --> 22:25.510
- So you made it.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.910
I ain't believing.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.131
Anyway, what are you having?

22:29.131 --> 22:30.840
- [Nicole] Can I have a vodka soda please?

22:30.840 --> 22:32.340
- Cool.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.090
- Let me get another Old Fashioned.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.190
Appreciate you, boss.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.050
What do you do for work?

22:41.901 --> 22:45.453
- I work at an ad agency
in the IT department.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.970
- Okay, you went to school for that?

22:48.970 --> 22:51.190
- I basically taught myself everything

22:51.190 --> 22:53.010
and was able to get a job, so.

22:53.010 --> 22:55.490
- Okay, all right, I see you.

22:55.490 --> 22:57.980
Sounds like a whole
bunch of responsibility

22:57.980 --> 22:59.463
and I bet you getting paid.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.360
- Yeah, I do all right.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.760
- So what do you do for fun?

23:05.810 --> 23:06.933
- I enjoy cooking.

23:08.230 --> 23:09.173
- Here you go.

23:10.756 --> 23:11.753
A vodka soda for the lady.

23:12.810 --> 23:14.020
Old Fashioned.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.080
You done with that one?

23:15.080 --> 23:16.230
- [John] Appreciate it.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.310
- Can I have another?

23:26.693 --> 23:28.270
A double.

23:28.270 --> 23:29.420
You can take this.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.690
- [Barkeeper] Okay, be right out.

23:31.690 --> 23:32.740
- [Nicole] Thank you.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.133
- So how was your drink?

23:40.530 --> 23:41.970
- It was weak.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.730
- [John] You drink much?

23:43.730 --> 23:44.563
- I do.

23:45.630 --> 23:46.823
It's my only vice.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.533
- Yeah.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.753
Mine's sex.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.433
Word.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.100
Nah.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.320
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.520
It's just that, you know, when you drink

24:00.520 --> 24:03.470
too much it can lead to certain things

24:03.470 --> 24:06.550
and you gotta be careful
who you drink around.

24:06.550 --> 24:09.543
You never know what they
may try to do to you.

24:12.690 --> 24:16.270
- Thanks but I'm pretty sure
I can take care of myself.

24:16.270 --> 24:18.670
- [John] Especially with
me here to protect you.

24:22.850 --> 24:23.900
- How was your drink?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.620
- It's a little bitter.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.680
- Sorry to hear that.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.040
Excuse me, can I have some shots please?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.853
- Oh, well, here's your double.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.083
What type of shot?

24:39.083 --> 24:39.916
- Whiskey.

24:39.916 --> 24:40.749
Fine, yep.

24:41.990 --> 24:42.880
- I'll bring that right out.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.040
The kitchen's about to close.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.994
Y'all want anything to eat?

24:45.994 --> 24:47.430
- Nah, I'm good.

24:47.430 --> 24:48.263
- [John] I'm good too.

24:48.263 --> 24:49.096
- All right.

24:50.117 --> 24:52.367
(mumbling)

24:54.840 --> 24:55.713
- Hey, Nicole.

24:56.937 --> 24:59.184
You don't have to be so nervous around me.

24:59.184 --> 25:00.750
I don't bite.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.173
Not unless you want me to.

25:03.162 --> 25:03.995
(laughing)

25:03.995 --> 25:05.740
Yo, just kidding.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.273
I'm just kidding.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.670
- All right, shots, here we go.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.733
- [Nicole] Can I do a dirty martini next?

25:15.310 --> 25:17.370
House vodka's fine.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.203
- Dirty martini.

25:18.203 --> 25:19.350
- Yes, please, thank you.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.995
- Got you.

25:20.995 --> 25:22.340
- Hey, I'm straight.

25:22.340 --> 25:23.520
Thanks boss.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.040
- Cheers.

25:25.040 --> 25:25.873
- [John] Cheers.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.470
- So I'm gonna run to
the restroom real quick

25:40.470 --> 25:42.773
and I'll be back in a minute.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.230
- I'll be right here.

25:58.601 --> 26:00.851
(mumbling)

26:07.800 --> 26:09.060
Hey yo, baby.

26:09.060 --> 26:09.893
What up, boy?

26:17.430 --> 26:18.860
Yeah.

26:18.860 --> 26:21.113
Yeah, nah, it's going all right.

26:21.113 --> 26:24.264
You know.

26:24.264 --> 26:25.464
It is what it is so far.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.620
Nah, she a little computer nerd.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.840
Little crazy.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.283
But body is banging.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.404
I'll probably be done
with this one around 11:30

26:35.404 --> 26:36.773
'cause you know how I do.

26:41.690 --> 26:43.230
Oh, you know it.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.063
Come on now.

26:45.928 --> 26:47.193
Of course I'm gonna hit it tonight.

26:49.430 --> 26:50.263
Yeah.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.700
Dirty martini.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.750
Just like (mumbling).

27:23.120 --> 27:23.953
- You want this?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.190
- What's wrong with it?

27:28.190 --> 27:30.530
- [Nicole] I just want something else.

27:30.530 --> 27:34.160
Excuse me, do you mind taking this away?

27:34.160 --> 27:35.508
- Is everything all right?

27:35.508 --> 27:36.341
Does it taste bad?

27:36.341 --> 27:37.174
- [Nicole] Nah, I just
don't want it anymore.

27:37.174 --> 27:38.030
But I can pay for it.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.270
- Oh, it's all good, it's okay, cool.

27:40.270 --> 27:41.940
Do you want anything else?

27:41.940 --> 27:43.860
- [Nicole] I'm good, thank you.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.510
- I'm good, boss, thanks.

27:45.510 --> 27:46.383
Yeah, yeah.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.337
- You look a little worried.

27:49.337 --> 27:50.587
- No, I'm fine.

27:51.884 --> 27:55.390
You know, speaking of fine,
you really are beautiful.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.200
Let's get out of here.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.410
I know this real dope bar
right down the street.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.000
I think you'd like it.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.060
Still.

28:04.060 --> 28:04.893
- Sure.

28:04.893 --> 28:05.790
- All right, cool.

28:07.940 --> 28:09.547
Hey.

28:09.547 --> 28:11.000
We about to be out, baby.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.408
All you.

28:12.408 --> 28:13.790
Thanks, baby.

28:13.790 --> 28:14.980
All right, family.

28:14.980 --> 28:15.813
Ladies first.

28:44.950 --> 28:45.783
Yo.

28:45.783 --> 28:47.263
I'm a total gentleman, I promise.

28:50.050 --> 28:51.410
- How do you act when you meet somebody

28:51.410 --> 28:52.950
that you don't like?

28:52.950 --> 28:55.170
- Well, I get out quick

28:55.170 --> 28:58.034
and then I split the bill with them.

28:58.034 --> 29:00.284
(laughing)

29:02.650 --> 29:05.230
Is that a smile, maybe, maybe?

29:05.230 --> 29:06.500
- No.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.222
- Or is your mouth just like crooked?

29:09.222 --> 29:10.055
- I'm cold.

29:10.055 --> 29:11.413
My mouth was shivering, it's cold.

29:12.630 --> 29:13.463
(laughing)

29:13.463 --> 29:14.370
Do you ever stop laughing?

29:14.370 --> 29:15.971
What's so funny?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.131
- It's good for the soul.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.381
Maybe you ought to join me.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.598
- Where is this?

29:23.598 --> 29:25.148
- No worries, it's right there.

29:39.266 --> 29:40.780
(chattering)

29:40.780 --> 29:42.540
Yeah, no, we're just gonna sit at the bar.

29:42.540 --> 29:43.740
All right, cool, thanks.

29:48.230 --> 29:49.787
See, told you.

29:49.787 --> 29:51.501
It's pretty cool in here.

29:51.501 --> 29:52.680
And there's a dope band.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.880
You wanna check 'em out?

29:54.780 --> 29:55.613
- Sure.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.922
(downbeat music)

30:00.922 --> 30:03.672
(muffled lyrics)

30:13.666 --> 30:18.666
♪ Come on over, sugar,
let me give you a kiss ♪

30:20.871 --> 30:25.371
♪ My favorite girl is a lot like this ♪

30:46.114 --> 30:48.689
Could I have a dirty martini please?

30:48.689 --> 30:51.253
- And could I have a whiskey
and a Pilsner, please?

30:54.277 --> 30:55.110
- So.

30:56.190 --> 30:58.460
What was your longest relationship?

30:58.460 --> 31:00.203
- Are we getting personal?

31:02.070 --> 31:02.903
I like that.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.060
Two years.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.640
- Yeah?

31:08.640 --> 31:09.753
So what happened?

31:11.418 --> 31:13.000
- Didn't wanna get married.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.480
- Why not?

31:14.480 --> 31:16.610
- Well, I had my doubts

31:16.610 --> 31:21.610
and second, I mean, there's so much of me

31:21.670 --> 31:25.210
for a lady such as yourself.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.670
I mean, come on.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.223
You know when you seen me,
you was wanting some of this.

31:30.525 --> 31:32.002
(laughing)

31:32.002 --> 31:35.252
Yo, I'm just playing, I'm just playing.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.560
- Thank you, thank you.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.050
- Anyways, what about you?

31:44.050 --> 31:46.120
When's the last time you had a boyfriend?

31:46.120 --> 31:47.423
- It's been a while.

31:48.630 --> 31:50.270
I don't know, I've been too busy

31:50.270 --> 31:52.720
so I really haven't had
time to have a boyfriend.

31:54.565 --> 31:56.560
- [John] So you gonna date (mumbling)?

31:56.560 --> 31:57.899
- Not really.

31:57.899 --> 31:58.732
I mean it's on and off

31:58.732 --> 32:01.993
but you should consider yourself lucky.

32:02.940 --> 32:04.630
- Maybe I do.

32:04.630 --> 32:05.903
- [Bartender] Here y'all go.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.233
- Thank you.

32:09.270 --> 32:10.103
- Thanks.

32:14.339 --> 32:15.172
- This is good.

32:15.172 --> 32:16.460
- I'm glad you like it.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.540
Can I get you anything else?

32:18.540 --> 32:19.430
- I'm good.

32:19.430 --> 32:20.671
You good?

32:20.671 --> 32:22.083
- Yeah, I'm good too, thanks.

32:24.960 --> 32:29.100
So, I mean, since you don't date much,

32:29.100 --> 32:32.320
I assume you don't get laid
too often then, do you?

32:33.985 --> 32:34.818
- Do you?

32:35.873 --> 32:37.060
- I do okay.

32:37.060 --> 32:38.563
- Well I do better than okay.

32:39.826 --> 32:42.076
(laughing)

32:42.970 --> 32:44.670
- Let me tell you something, baby.

32:44.670 --> 32:47.030
As beautiful as you are,
I don't think you'll

32:47.030 --> 32:49.130
ever have a problem getting laid.

32:49.130 --> 32:52.610
Now for brothers such as myself,

32:52.610 --> 32:54.483
it be a little more difficult.

32:56.590 --> 32:57.923
- Sound bitter about that.

32:58.930 --> 33:02.580
- No, just a little frustrating
sometimes, that's all.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.413
- Yeah.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.424
Well it goes both ways.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.273
- Is that so?

33:10.770 --> 33:12.120
How's this date going then?

33:16.460 --> 33:18.153
- I'm still here, aren't I?

33:19.697 --> 33:20.530
- Yes you are.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.360
Excuse me for a moment

33:35.360 --> 33:37.670
but I have to use the restroom

33:37.670 --> 33:39.933
so I'll be right back.

33:49.700 --> 33:52.450
(downbeat music)

34:11.300 --> 34:13.520
Nicole, you sexy something, you.

34:18.368 --> 34:20.618
(mumbling)

34:24.618 --> 34:25.590
You.

34:25.590 --> 34:26.422
Me.

34:27.463 --> 34:30.000
(laughing)

34:30.000 --> 34:31.123
Do not let me down.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.400
- Are y'all gonna be much longer?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.469
We're getting ready to close.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.170
- No, we're actually good.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.340
Could you take a selfie for me

34:42.340 --> 34:44.060
and I'll be out of your hair?

34:44.060 --> 34:45.112
Thank you so much.

34:48.710 --> 34:49.543
Thank you.

34:51.929 --> 34:52.763
- Miss me?

34:54.290 --> 34:55.840
- We have to close out our tab.

34:58.450 --> 35:00.093
- Where are we going next?

35:01.316 --> 35:02.270
- Well I don't know about you

35:02.270 --> 35:04.703
but I'm pretty tired so
I'm just gonna go home.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.550
- Well, I'd still like
to at least make sure

35:07.550 --> 35:09.220
that you make it home safe.

35:09.220 --> 35:11.970
- [Nicole] How about we just
finish these drinks first?

35:17.630 --> 35:18.463
- Well.

35:19.530 --> 35:22.620
Maybe we should get
something to eat though.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.983
All this drinking.

35:24.910 --> 35:28.331
It's really gonna hurt you in the morning.

35:28.331 --> 35:29.420
- I actually was just gonna go home

35:29.420 --> 35:32.280
and make myself dinner so I'm good.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.690
- Okay.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.000
Well I'm sorry that I couldn't

35:35.000 --> 35:37.363
take us out to eat afterwards.

35:37.363 --> 35:39.093
- It's fine.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.600
- But if you don't mind, it'd be nice

35:41.600 --> 35:45.073
to get some good old
fashioned home cooking.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.083
I can get it to go.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.193
- You want me to cook for you?

35:52.680 --> 35:53.513
- Yeah.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.330
- Okay.

35:56.330 --> 35:58.580
(mumbling)

36:04.210 --> 36:06.823
- I'll go ahead and call an Uber.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.060
All right.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.503
Let's get out of here.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.973
Yeah, that Uber should be
here in like one minute.

36:27.170 --> 36:30.450
- Thank you for paying
for that tab in there.

36:30.450 --> 36:31.360
I mean, I would've paid for it.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.640
It wasn't really a big deal.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.540
- It's no problem.

36:35.859 --> 36:37.288
- You wanna take a selfie?

36:37.288 --> 36:38.121
- Yeah.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.310
- Thanks.

36:49.310 --> 36:50.143
- No problem.

36:53.996 --> 36:54.829
Well.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.760
- [Nicole] I'll be right back.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.533
I'm gonna go change.

37:12.468 --> 37:13.301
- Okay.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.970
You sure you don't need
my help with anything?

37:31.970 --> 37:33.170
- [Nicole] No, I'm good.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.770
- [John] Nice place you got here.

37:38.770 --> 37:39.760
- Thanks.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.593
- No problem.

37:42.811 --> 37:44.811
You know, you really don't have to cook.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.880
Matter of fact, I've never had a woman

37:47.880 --> 37:49.730
make dinner for me on the first date.

37:54.330 --> 37:55.280
So what you making?

37:57.330 --> 37:58.163
- Spaghetti.

37:59.512 --> 38:00.345
That good?

38:00.345 --> 38:01.178
- That's cool, cool.

38:04.290 --> 38:05.123
Shit!

38:06.640 --> 38:09.260
Girl, this wine is terrific!

38:09.260 --> 38:10.360
- [Nicole] What's that?

38:10.360 --> 38:15.340
- Oh, I said the wine
is good, it's good wine.

38:15.340 --> 38:16.930
That good wine.

38:16.930 --> 38:17.763
- Thanks.

38:26.026 --> 38:28.660
- [John] You mind if I take a look around?

38:28.660 --> 38:31.050
- Yeah, just don't go into my bedroom.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.129
(mumbling)

38:48.470 --> 38:51.580
- [John] So where do you
get your artwork from?

38:51.580 --> 38:52.833
- Most of it's my work.

38:55.570 --> 38:57.243
- [John] It's interesting.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.680
- So I should be done in like 15 minutes.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.126
Is that cool?

39:08.126 --> 39:08.959
- Cool.

39:08.959 --> 39:11.460
Take your time, take your time.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.223
Take as much time as you want.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.960
(moaning)

39:43.260 --> 39:44.177
Shit, baby.

39:45.809 --> 39:46.642
This is fantastic.

39:46.642 --> 39:47.610
- Yeah?

39:47.610 --> 39:49.010
You like it?

39:49.010 --> 39:50.660
Thanks, I like to cook, it's fun.

39:51.701 --> 39:52.534
- Okay, well let me tell you something.

39:52.534 --> 39:55.470
You would make the perfect wife.

39:55.470 --> 39:57.880
- Yeah, I don't think
we're quite there yet

39:57.880 --> 40:00.393
but I'll take the complement.

40:06.783 --> 40:09.340
You need to leave right after this, okay?

40:09.340 --> 40:10.370
Yeah.

40:10.370 --> 40:11.203
- Leave?

40:12.569 --> 40:14.690
Well, we just getting started here.

40:14.690 --> 40:16.490
- I don't wanna give you the wrong idea

40:16.490 --> 40:18.790
but I'm not hooking up
with you tonight, John.

40:21.970 --> 40:23.390
- All right, all right.

40:23.390 --> 40:24.660
It's cool, it's whatever.

40:24.660 --> 40:25.870
But let me tell you something.

40:25.870 --> 40:27.765
You keep cooking like this

40:27.765 --> 40:30.060
and I ain't ever gonna leave.

40:30.060 --> 40:30.893
Facts.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.960
- You want some more wine?

40:33.960 --> 40:35.723
- [John] Yeah, go ahead, top me off.

40:42.460 --> 40:43.313
- [Nicole] Stop.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.310
- My bad, go ahead.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.143
Top me off.

40:51.470 --> 40:53.020
- This is the last drink, okay?

40:54.260 --> 40:55.093
I'm serious.

40:55.093 --> 40:55.926
- All right.

41:03.790 --> 41:04.763
You got a restroom?

41:07.390 --> 41:11.240
- Excuse me, it's the second
door on the left behind you.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.545
- Over here?

41:12.545 --> 41:13.378
- [Nicole] Yeah.

41:13.378 --> 41:14.211
- Okay.

41:15.235 --> 41:17.485
(mumbling)

41:40.430 --> 41:42.680
(laughing)

41:45.180 --> 41:46.190
- Are you okay?

41:46.190 --> 41:47.023
Come here.

41:56.920 --> 41:57.753
Hey.

41:57.753 --> 41:59.380
Are you gonna be okay to get home?

42:01.180 --> 42:04.063
- Now why would you invite
me over if you didn't

42:04.063 --> 42:04.896
plan for me to--

42:04.896 --> 42:06.900
- Okay, I already told
you when we were in there.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.723
I'm not hooking up with you tonight.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.090
- You serious?

42:12.090 --> 42:13.473
- Yes, I'm serious.

42:15.510 --> 42:16.523
- What the fuck, yo?

42:17.750 --> 42:20.063
We went out and had a good time,

42:21.260 --> 42:22.833
had drinks that I bought.

42:23.870 --> 42:26.100
We come back to your place.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.305
You cook dinner.

42:28.305 --> 42:29.890
What the fuck else do
you expect me to think?

42:29.890 --> 42:31.180
- I cooked dinner for you because you

42:31.180 --> 42:32.780
bought the drinks, you fucking asshole.

42:32.780 --> 42:33.920
I was being--

42:36.772 --> 42:37.605
Fucking!

42:38.641 --> 42:40.423
(groaning)

42:40.423 --> 42:42.590
(yelling)

44:03.986 --> 44:04.819
Fuck.

44:29.564 --> 44:32.147
(upbeat music)

44:34.629 --> 44:37.462
(engine cranking)

45:18.870 --> 45:19.720
- How's it going?

45:21.630 --> 45:22.980
- Just got some lights out.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.567
And I need to do some
yard work so here I am.

45:31.487 --> 45:33.643
- You know it's midnight, right?

45:36.380 --> 45:37.512
- Sorry.

45:37.512 --> 45:38.562
They're prescription.

45:39.470 --> 45:41.020
- Oh, I'm sorry, that was rude.

45:42.450 --> 45:43.930
Now I'm supposed to ask if you have one

45:43.930 --> 45:47.880
of our credit cards and
if you'd like to save 10%

45:47.880 --> 45:48.943
on today's purchase?

45:51.680 --> 45:52.513
- No thanks.

46:10.270 --> 46:12.663
- Looks like you're heading
to my kind of party.

46:15.938 --> 46:17.488
All you need now is a chainsaw.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.490
- The noise might wake the neighbors.

46:21.562 --> 46:23.060
- You bet it would.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.400
Five bricks.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.743
- Oh yeah, sorry.

46:47.990 --> 46:48.823
Thank you.

46:49.881 --> 46:50.798
The lights.

46:57.390 --> 46:58.483
- Have a good night.

47:07.481 --> 47:10.064
(upbeat music)

48:19.422 --> 48:22.172
(downbeat music)

48:46.930 --> 48:49.023
- You're ruining my place, you asshole.

48:51.830 --> 48:54.378
And you're a fucking cop.

48:54.378 --> 48:56.830
(laughing)

48:56.830 --> 48:58.723
Didn't dig too deep, did you, Nicole?

49:01.511 --> 49:03.323
That's what I get for dating online.

49:17.310 --> 49:18.143
Oh my god.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.553
- Boo.

50:11.690 --> 50:13.119
The hell, girl?

50:13.119 --> 50:13.952
You ain't done yet?

50:16.360 --> 50:18.520
Girl, I'm talking to you.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.253
- No, you're dead.

50:21.350 --> 50:23.480
Okay, I killed you.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.313
- Killed me?

50:24.313 --> 50:26.010
You chopped off my hands and my feet.

50:26.010 --> 50:28.280
I should've made you pay for them drinks.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.690
Yo, come on, come on,
come on, come, come, come.

50:30.690 --> 50:31.523
You don't wanna do this.

50:31.523 --> 50:33.150
You don't wanna get the place dirty.

50:33.150 --> 50:34.030
Don't wanna make a mess.

50:34.030 --> 50:35.870
And your cooking, dinner, dinner was good.

50:35.870 --> 50:37.480
Dinner was good.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.913
Just stop, come on, come on.

50:39.830 --> 50:40.713
Put it down.

50:42.030 --> 50:44.280
(mumbling)

50:50.470 --> 50:51.970
- Why'd you have to attack me?

50:56.100 --> 50:56.933
- Yeah.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.613
That was a dick move.

51:01.050 --> 51:03.551
Was drunk and horny a good enough answer?

51:03.551 --> 51:04.900
(laughing)

51:04.900 --> 51:06.343
Yo, it was nothing personal.

51:07.180 --> 51:09.380
- Raping me wasn't personal?

51:09.380 --> 51:10.760
- Yo, what's the big deal?

51:10.760 --> 51:12.090
I thought you were feeling me.

51:12.090 --> 51:13.528
Baby, baby, come on, come on.

51:13.528 --> 51:14.973
All right, all right now, damn it.

51:16.235 --> 51:17.540
You know I'm a cop.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.320
Like COPS.

51:19.320 --> 51:23.084
Like what you gonna do
when they come for you?

51:23.084 --> 51:25.334
(mumbling)

51:26.821 --> 51:27.654
- You know what?

51:27.654 --> 51:28.600
You got what you deserved.

51:30.950 --> 51:32.190
- Getting chopped up?

51:32.190 --> 51:35.033
- Yeah, you were way
too heavy in one piece.

51:36.750 --> 51:38.900
- First and foremost,
I resent that remark.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.250
Second of all, just so you know,

51:41.250 --> 51:44.700
I lost 10 pounds before
our Tinder date, ma'am.

51:44.700 --> 51:49.283
- Sir, more like 25 but who's counting?

51:51.907 --> 51:53.210
(laughing)

51:53.210 --> 51:54.100
- Yeah, you're right.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.150
- Yeah, that's funny.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.160
- Well.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.420
The least you could do is
get me something to drink.

52:06.420 --> 52:07.740
- Are you serious right now?

52:07.740 --> 52:09.090
- Yeah.

52:09.090 --> 52:11.260
Besides, I know you got
some alcohol in here

52:11.260 --> 52:13.300
'cause don't nobody drink as much as you.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.220
You can really put 'em down, girl.

52:15.220 --> 52:18.220
I mean, what are you, like full
time alcoholic or something?

52:25.230 --> 52:27.443
So you going to get the drink?

52:27.443 --> 52:30.120
(laughing)

52:30.120 --> 52:32.280
Okay, go get me a drink.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.343
Well, shit.

52:34.190 --> 52:35.993
Oh, she chopped me up good.

52:35.993 --> 52:38.243
(laughing)

52:40.009 --> 52:41.665
How the fuck am I gonna get away?

52:41.665 --> 52:42.498
Oh shit.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.433
Baby.

53:06.832 --> 53:09.332
Aren't you such a good helper?

53:19.600 --> 53:20.433
Ladies first.

53:34.940 --> 53:36.210
- Really?

53:36.210 --> 53:38.517
- Well help a brother out, shit.

53:48.923 --> 53:50.423
Fuck, that's good.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.360
- Yeah, I don't buy cheap wine.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.703
- Well I have to get the
name of that non-cheap wine.

53:59.060 --> 53:59.910
- Want some more?

54:01.990 --> 54:03.783
First, question.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.913
Have you attacked women
before or am I your first?

54:10.670 --> 54:11.503
- Attacked?

54:13.820 --> 54:18.527
Baby, I'm just trying to get
a little well-deserved action.

54:18.527 --> 54:19.360
Okay?

54:19.360 --> 54:20.193
- [Nicole] What?

54:21.720 --> 54:24.423
- Yo, I spent over 100 dollars last night.

54:25.260 --> 54:27.900
You telling me you didn't wanna get laid?

54:27.900 --> 54:30.420
- Okay, so what's your family like?

54:30.420 --> 54:32.320
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

54:32.320 --> 54:34.120
- Don't you think it's a little too late

54:34.120 --> 54:35.320
to be asking about my family?

54:35.320 --> 54:37.293
- Answer the damn question.

54:38.490 --> 54:39.840
- Yes.

54:39.840 --> 54:42.690
I have a sis, well,

54:42.690 --> 54:44.733
I had a sister.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.330
- So would you like if
your sister was drugged

54:48.330 --> 54:49.640
and raped?

54:49.640 --> 54:51.325
Or what about your mother?

54:51.325 --> 54:52.867
What if this happened to her?

54:55.730 --> 54:58.590
- Actually, to be honest
with you, they'd be straight.

54:58.590 --> 55:00.530
They can pay for themselves.

55:00.530 --> 55:02.690
(laughing)

55:02.690 --> 55:03.713
- Fucking asshole.

55:04.770 --> 55:05.930
You know what?

55:05.930 --> 55:07.830
I'm glad I killed you.

55:07.830 --> 55:08.663
- You know what?

55:09.517 --> 55:10.940
That makes one of us.

55:10.940 --> 55:13.540
Now, can you get me some
more of that good ass wine?

55:24.050 --> 55:25.050
So what's your plan?

55:25.930 --> 55:28.760
People saw us out together last night.

55:28.760 --> 55:32.290
The Uber driver dropped us off here.

55:32.290 --> 55:36.373
My DNA's all over your house.

55:37.630 --> 55:39.173
Not the way I'd hoped.

55:41.270 --> 55:42.470
- Easy.

55:42.470 --> 55:45.791
After the Uber dropped us off, you left.

55:45.791 --> 55:46.750
(laughing)

55:46.750 --> 55:47.700
- That's your plan?

55:49.790 --> 55:50.623
Baby.

55:51.791 --> 55:53.800
They're gonna come searching for you.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.790
I'm a cop.

55:55.790 --> 55:57.930
They're going to find you.

55:57.930 --> 56:00.563
Then they gonna take your
pretty little ass to jail.

56:01.420 --> 56:02.253
- You know what?

56:04.626 --> 56:06.090
- What?

56:06.090 --> 56:07.990
- It's better than where you're going.

56:11.967 --> 56:14.217
(chopping)

56:16.550 --> 56:17.383
- Well.

56:18.640 --> 56:19.743
You cut it off.

56:22.220 --> 56:23.823
Wasn't too clean though.

56:25.530 --> 56:27.130
You should watch a little
more Game of Thrones,

56:27.130 --> 56:28.880
less Sex And The City, though, huh?

56:32.560 --> 56:34.160
So Nicole.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.360
Can I ask you something?

56:36.900 --> 56:38.840
Is this turning you on?

56:45.005 --> 56:46.317
Baby, baby.

56:46.317 --> 56:49.355
Baby, I just want you to
think about this, okay?

56:49.355 --> 56:50.790
- Maybe this is turning me on.

56:50.790 --> 56:54.332
- Baby, just take a little, take a minute.

56:54.332 --> 56:57.754
Let's pray, let's pray,
come on, let's pray.

56:57.754 --> 57:00.087
(crunching)

57:08.958 --> 57:11.208
(flushing)

57:15.925 --> 57:18.425
(tense music)

58:03.055 --> 58:05.222
(yelling)

58:18.389 --> 58:20.556
(sighing)

58:30.670 --> 58:31.920
- Hey, what's up, Nicole?

58:34.600 --> 58:36.433
Nicole, you all right?

58:41.400 --> 58:42.910
Hey.

58:42.910 --> 58:44.350
What's going on?

58:44.350 --> 58:45.230
- [Nicole] Hey.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.740
- Ah, wine for breakfast, huh?

58:47.740 --> 58:49.183
That little hair of the dog?

58:51.230 --> 58:52.320
Well I just wanted to say what's up.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.420
You know, if you ever need anything,

58:54.420 --> 58:56.627
you know, I'm right next door.

58:56.627 --> 58:57.460
- Yeah.

58:58.770 --> 59:00.030
I'll talk to you later.

59:00.030 --> 59:01.320
- Oh yeah, yeah, no problem.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.070
I just wanna say what's up.

59:03.070 --> 59:04.840
If you wanna get up later tonight, though,

59:04.840 --> 59:06.660
I'm having some people
over to watch the game

59:06.660 --> 59:08.893
so, you know, feel free to come by or ...

59:34.714 --> 59:37.464
(downbeat music)

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.910
- [John] Hey, it's hot as hell in here!

01:00:18.356 --> 01:00:19.706
And I'm scared of the dark.

01:00:21.622 --> 01:00:23.823
Stinks, smells like something
crawled up here and died.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.255
Oh, that's me.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.505
(laughing)

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.970
For real though, let me out.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:32.670
- You're still talking.

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.168
- [John] Nicole, Nicole!

01:00:35.168 --> 01:00:36.843
(shouting)

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:39.176
(crunching)

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.943
- That's what you get, you
Harvey Weinstein motherfucker.

01:00:56.231 --> 01:00:58.814
(upbeat music)

01:01:28.793 --> 01:01:31.043
(grunting)

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:39.763
- Hey, you need some help?

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.700
- [Nicole] Nope, I'm--

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.820
- No, no, girl, don't be silly.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.713
I got this.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.390
Good thing I workout, am I right?

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:54.653
Am I right, am I Mr. Right?

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.150
Girl, what you got in here?

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.500
'Cause this thing is like--

01:02:00.229 --> 01:02:01.930
- You know what I was thinking?

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.490
Maybe we should go out sometime, yeah?

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:04.839
- Yeah, so what's up?

01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:05.813
You trying to like--

01:02:05.813 --> 01:02:06.841
- Wednesday.

01:02:06.841 --> 01:02:09.330
- Wednesday, Wednesday, yeah, Wednesday.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.349
Most definitely, yeah.

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:12.599
(mumbling)

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:14.834
- All right.

01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:16.320
- I can't wait.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.153
Girl.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.443
Wednesday.

01:02:19.443 --> 01:02:20.860
- All right, I'll see you then?

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.993
- See you then.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.670
I'm talking about, Gare Bear!

01:02:47.587 --> 01:02:48.935
Yeah!

01:02:48.935 --> 01:02:51.685
(dramatic music)

01:04:33.588 --> 01:04:36.171
(gentle music)

01:04:55.946 --> 01:04:58.613
(phone ringing)

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.914
(upbeat music)

01:05:59.617 --> 01:06:01.867
(laughing)

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.517
- Hey Nicole.

01:06:05.517 --> 01:06:06.667
I brought you a coffee.

01:06:08.922 --> 01:06:09.755
How was your weekend?

01:06:09.755 --> 01:06:10.773
How'd your date go?

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.810
- It was no big deal

01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.110
but anyway, I wanna hear about your gig.

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:19.390
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:23.173
I'm pretty sure it was much
more fun than what I did.

01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:24.623
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.970
Gig was good.

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.600
We played for a whole like 10 people

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.350
but they seemed to dig it.

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:32.620
- Cool.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.800
So I was thinking that maybe we

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.453
could get together soon?

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.563
Sound good?

01:06:41.617 --> 01:06:43.060
- Yeah, that sounds great.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.570
- Yeah.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:45.760
How about tonight?

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.894
We could go out for some
drinks or something.

01:06:48.894 --> 01:06:50.613
- Cool, yeah, let's do it.

01:06:50.613 --> 01:06:51.470
- Cool.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.920
All right, well I'm gonna get back to work

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.683
but I'll see you later on today.

01:06:55.683 --> 01:06:56.850
- [Male] Okay.

01:07:02.596 --> 01:07:05.179
(upbeat music)

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.033
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:07:31.219 --> 01:07:32.552
How y'all doing?

01:07:33.647 --> 01:07:35.290
So, I hope everything goes well

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.310
with your client today, okay?

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:38.344
Good?

01:07:38.344 --> 01:07:39.177
High five.

01:07:46.927 --> 01:07:47.760
- What the fuck was that?

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.890
- Crazy girl, I don't know you.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:50.723
Bitch.

01:07:51.592 --> 01:07:52.425
- Anyway, how's your week looking?

01:07:52.425 --> 01:07:55.123
- Girl, usual client bullshit everyday.

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.530
- We need raises.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:59.380
- Say that.

01:08:12.636 --> 01:08:13.656
- You done for the day?

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.168
- Yep, you ready to go?

01:08:15.168 --> 01:08:16.001
- Sure.

01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:19.550
(upbeat music)

01:09:08.392 --> 01:09:09.559
Hey, I'm home.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.120
- [Male] Hey.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.073
I'm cooking dinner.

01:09:17.144 --> 01:09:18.907
I made your favorite, girl.

01:09:18.907 --> 01:09:19.740
- Oh, good.

01:09:21.368 --> 01:09:22.243
Did you miss me today?

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.598
- Come on, now.

01:09:24.598 --> 01:09:25.430
Now you know a part of me is missing

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.483
whenever we not together.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.120
You ready to eat?

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.220
- [Nicole] Yes, I am starving.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.580
Thank you for cooking.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:34.569
- No problem.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.423
Oh, your parents stopped by.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.670
- Hey!

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:39.970
Thank you guys for coming.

01:09:41.126 --> 01:09:42.680
- Glad we could make it, sweetheart.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.866
- And John's so (mumbling), isn't he?

01:09:46.866 --> 01:09:47.698
- Would you take that hat off?

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:48.720
You look ridiculous.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.742
- Girl, don't act like that.

01:09:50.742 --> 01:09:51.892
You know you like it.

01:09:51.892 --> 01:09:53.500
- Whatever.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.833
- Found your chef, huh?

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.400
- Crazy weekend, huh?

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.633
- Yes, it was.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.490
I have a surprise for you guys.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:05.493
I'll be right back, okay.

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:06.493
All right.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.240
- [Dad] You catch this?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.073
- Oh yeah.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.030
Minnetonka's finest.

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.863
Gefilte fish.

01:10:15.496 --> 01:10:16.329
- So.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.830
What do you guys think?

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:19.980
- [Dad] It's beautiful.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.723
- That's so lovely and it's
beautiful just like you.

01:10:27.338 --> 01:10:28.324
- Thank you.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:29.200
- You're so talented.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.000
- You get your talent from your mom.

01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:34.792
