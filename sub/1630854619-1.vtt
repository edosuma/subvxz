10:08.303 --> 10:10.174
-What? Wh-Where?
-I... It's...

10:10.218 --> 10:12.307
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, Jesus.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.700
-It's a dinner roll.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.962
How did that get there?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.528
How did you do that?

10:16.572 --> 10:18.661
A magician never reveals
his secrets.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.664
After high school,
I escaped to Los Angeles.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.666
-I went to USC...
-Mm-hmm.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.842
...where I nurtured
my obsession with television,

10:25.886 --> 10:28.149
which led to my current job
at TV Guide.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.412
Which, I am guessing,
you've never even heard of.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.632
No, no, no. My-my parents had
a subscription to TV Guide.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.807
Oh, thank God.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.286
They're retired now.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.637
My dad is
a world-class putterer.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.595
A good guy.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.336
And, um...

10:41.379 --> 10:45.427
my mom is a triathlete.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.995
Your mother's a triath...
As in, like, the whole...

10:48.038 --> 10:49.431
Mm-hmm.
Swimming, biking, running.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.693
-Yep, yep, yep.
-Shut up.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.260
She is exceptionally driven.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.262
-Though not very good.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.437
-Wow.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.744
Are you close with them?

10:57.787 --> 11:00.050
Yeah. I mean, it's...
it's complicated.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.704
But they're great.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.314
They're essentially great.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.361
What about your parents?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.539
Can I just say
that this Diet Coke

11:10.582 --> 11:13.847
is the perfect
syrup-to-carbonation ratio?

11:13.890 --> 11:16.023
This is, like,
Chipotle-level perfect.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.112
No one does Diet Coke
like Chipotle.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.549
Hmm.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.944
They both passed away.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.294
My father died
when I was very young.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.950
And my mother, she got cancer
a few years after that, so...

11:32.735 --> 11:34.215
Yes, it sucked.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.869
I'm so sorry.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.698
It's okay.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.223
Thank you.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.924
-Oh, whoa.
-Watch out.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.621
Maybe we should
go inside somewhere.

11:49.665 --> 11:52.102
I don't really want
to get gay-bashed.

11:54.017 --> 11:57.586
Okay. Well, then let's go
to your place.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.067
I've never been
to Jersey City before.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.851
Plus, I have the, um...

12:01.895 --> 12:03.853
the aforementioned
roommate, so...

12:03.897 --> 12:07.596
I would love to go to my place,
but they just...

12:07.639 --> 12:10.730
they just painted my apartment,
and I'm afraid the fumes

12:10.773 --> 12:13.733
might not be safe to breathe in.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.866
Okay. Fine.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.434
Then... let's go to my place.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.175
Okay, let's do that.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.181
I... I'm hoping
my roommate isn't here.

12:27.224 --> 12:30.358
She's very monosyllabic.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.099
Okay.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.407
-Kit?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.541
Hey, Kirby.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.761
Hey.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.937
-Uh, this is Mike.
-Hi, Kirby.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.590
Mike.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.114
Um, we were just gonna...

12:47.157 --> 12:48.506
-You want me to...?
-Yeah.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.639
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.818
This is my boudoir.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.341
Wow.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.434
This is... This is really cool.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.262
Thanks.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.483
So, she-she's really
monosyllabic.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.615
Oh, yeah. I've never seen her
leave the apartment.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.749
I swear to God
she only eats bagels, toasted.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.142
I have to be nice
to her, though.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.621
She pays more rent than me.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.843

20:59.040 --> 21:00.302
That is fascinating.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.435
-Okay, you. One word.
-Impatient.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.306
-That actually makes a lot
of sen... -Hold that thought.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.960
Have you seen the black apple?

21:06.003 --> 21:08.310
Well... I don't know
what that means.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.703
Come. Come, come, come.
He'll find us.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.357
I can't imagine that I have.
Okay.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.272
It's, uh... Excuse me.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.709
So, I would say that
it-it blurs the lines

21:15.752 --> 21:17.928
between art and produce,

21:17.972 --> 21:21.192
uh, and that it-it hearkens
back to the Gilded Age.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.933
There's a certain opulence
about it.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.327
That's a very impressive
analysis. He's a real pro.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.850
Yeah, well, it reminds us

21:26.894 --> 21:28.591
that sometimes life
is just black and white

21:28.635 --> 21:30.767
and that sometimes, uh,
an apple is just an apple,

21:30.811 --> 21:32.421
and it's good.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.336
-Is this good?
-No, it's terrible.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.338
-It's terrible?
-Yes.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.949
Uh, at best, it belongs in a...
a high-end doctor's office.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.429
Stop. You're being generous.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.344
I could see this
in a low-end dentist's office.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.390
I give you an "A" for effort.
Cheers.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.087
-Phew. Thank you.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.523
-I hate that.
-You did very well.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.264
Yeah, you should.
It's not good at all.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.049
This is the roof garden.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.095
-Oh, my goodness.
-Isn't it amazing?

21:54.138 --> 21:56.837
Yeah, look at this.
It's beautiful.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.840
They all really like you,
by the way.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.668
I feel like Nina hates me.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.322
No, no. If she didn't like you,

22:03.365 --> 22:04.671
she'd be much more
accommodating.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.020
I promise.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.935
Oh, that's good to know.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.859
I love this city.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.949
Thank you for coming tonight.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.603
Thank you for having me.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.301
It's a pleasure
to have you as my date.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.524
So, um, shall we go
to your place tonight?

22:31.567 --> 22:33.482
The last bus
is in like half an hour.

22:33.526 --> 22:34.875
I don't even know if we...

22:34.918 --> 22:36.398
Come on.
We could make that, easy.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.878
-It'd be fun.
-Clearly, you've never been

22:37.921 --> 22:39.619
to Port Authority
on a Friday night.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.185
Is there a reason you don't
want me to see your place?

22:41.229 --> 22:42.970
I mean, at first,
it was paint fumes,

22:43.013 --> 22:45.276
and now you hiding a dead body
or something? I...

22:45.320 --> 22:46.887
No. No. There's no...

22:46.930 --> 22:48.323
-That's ridiculous.
-Mm-hmm.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.716
The whole idea
that I wouldn't want you

22:49.759 --> 22:51.065
to see my place,
that's ridiculous.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.936
Okay, then. So?

22:52.980 --> 22:55.374
Okay.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.463
Fine. We'll go to my place.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.029
If that's what you want.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.162
-Oh, it's what I want, Michael.
-Okay, then.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.729
-That's what we'll do.
-Mm-hmm.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.645
-We'll go to my place.
-Mm-hmm.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.387
-Now?
-Yeah.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.040
Let's go.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.000
-All right.
-Come on.

23:13.043 --> 23:14.784
Let's go.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.876
And this is the hallway. Just...

23:20.921 --> 23:22.575
Eggshell white on the...

23:22.618 --> 23:24.272
-the wall.
-That's a lovely color.

23:24.315 --> 23:27.318
And, um, here's my door.

23:27.362 --> 23:31.410
This is just your-your...
all-American, typical door.

23:32.846 --> 23:36.415
And so, um, I guess
I'll just open the door

23:36.458 --> 23:38.808
and we can go inside.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.463
Yep. That's-that's usually
how it works, Michael.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.987
Before we go in,
I want to remind you

23:44.031 --> 23:47.643
that your friends said
that they really like me.

23:47.687 --> 23:49.297
Oh, Jesus. Just open the door.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.907
Okay.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.998
-I mean, I'm just a person
like everybody. -

23:55.042 --> 23:57.348
Come on. Let me see
your apartment.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.482
Come on.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.657
Okay.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.315
Okay. So, um...

24:07.358 --> 24:10.971
this-this is where I live.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.929
My apartment.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.889
♪

24:15.932 --> 24:17.456
Home sweet home.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.600
Okay. Um...

24:32.862 --> 24:34.385
-Oh, you don't want to...
-Oh, my God.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.039
-They're in here, too.
-...go in the bedroom.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.878
Oh, Papa.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.627
What is this, Michael?

24:59.759 --> 25:01.369
They're Smurfs.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.937
Yes, I... I can see that.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.287
Is it... Is it a fetish?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.941
Oh, God, no.
This is not a fetish.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.464
No, this is, uh...

25:09.508 --> 25:10.813
I guess it's a hobby.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.554
Or, uh, maybe it's a passion.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.296
Uh, I started collecting these
when I was ten.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.037
It was my friend
Linda Swzedo's fault.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.473
She got me into them.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.301
She was totally obsessed
with them,

25:20.344 --> 25:21.998
and then I became obsessed, too.

25:22.042 --> 25:25.480
Uh, my mother would take me
to Gift Expressions

25:25.524 --> 25:28.222
every Sunday after
I helped her grocery shop,

25:28.265 --> 25:32.705
and she would buy me a Smurf
figurine as-as a reward.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.576
My favorite was Vanity Smurf,

25:34.620 --> 25:36.970
who I now realize
was a total closet case.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.059
Like I was. And then...

25:39.102 --> 25:40.669
I don't know, after my mom died,

25:40.713 --> 25:43.106
I did take a ten-year
Smurf sabbatical.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.717
But along came eBay,

25:44.760 --> 25:47.154
and then I just kind of...
all hell broke loose.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.852
I started going to toy shows,
and I went to flea markets.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.680
I was buying
and selling and trad...

25:51.724 --> 25:54.117
And I-I really can't
defend this.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.904
Yeah.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.343
I think that they take me
back in time.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.999
You know, like...

26:06.042 --> 26:08.001
to before my mom died.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.525
-When...

26:12.179 --> 26:14.181
When things were easier.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.489
I think that you can imagine
why I was a little hesitant

26:18.533 --> 26:20.491
to bring you to my apartment.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.585
Say something.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.284
I, uh...

26:35.681 --> 26:37.770
I fooled around with someone.

26:37.813 --> 26:40.076
At the gym last week.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.080
I know that you and I
have never had

26:44.124 --> 26:46.648
the "exclusive" conversation,
and-and-and...

26:46.692 --> 26:49.259
I don't know. I, um...

26:49.303 --> 26:51.261
I feel guilty about it.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.655
Why are you telling me this?

26:53.699 --> 26:55.657
Because I feel guilty about it.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.355
And that's new for me, Michael.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.662
You know, I've never actually
had a real relationship before.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.490
A... a-a boyfriend.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.449
Uh, just a lot
of casual hookups.

27:05.493 --> 27:08.409
And, you know, I don't usually
want more than that, but...

27:08.452 --> 27:11.107
If-if someone gets too attached,

27:11.151 --> 27:15.546
I-I get out of there,
and-and-and this...

27:15.590 --> 27:18.114
you...

27:18.158 --> 27:20.421
it scares me.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.127
You scare me, too.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.740
I think you're very cool.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.394
I think your friends
are very cool.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.701
And I now know
that you go to the gym

27:39.745 --> 27:42.965
for things other than
weight lifting and treadmill.

27:43.009 --> 27:46.055
And I'm worried that

27:46.099 --> 27:49.015
I'm going to fall
in love with you

27:49.058 --> 27:51.321
and you're going
to break my heart.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.412
That scares me.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.460
I guess we scare each other.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.549
I guess we do.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.597
MICHAEL:
Smurfgate almost derailed us,

28:06.641 --> 28:09.165
but by Christmas,
we were back on track.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.386
-Merry Christmas.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.695
KIT:
How old is this thing?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.871
1960s. So, I mean,
it's not exactly your childhood,

28:18.914 --> 28:20.481
-but you know...

28:20.524 --> 28:21.830
It's got the...
it's got the wand and the cups

28:21.874 --> 28:23.745
and the lady
that you saw in half.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.051
Um, where did you get it?

28:25.094 --> 28:27.270
Oh, you could buy anything
on eBay.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.837
It's really special, Mike.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.578
You'll be happy to know
that I was able to resist

28:30.621 --> 28:33.276
a super rare Christmas Carol
Smurf that was $300.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.625
Oh, must have taken
a lot of self-control.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.758
-It did.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.368
-I love it.
-Good.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.761
Thank you.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.245
-I got you something.
-You did?

28:45.288 --> 28:46.899
Stand up.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.770
Not as good as yours.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.470
Close your eyes.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.255
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.039
-You better be very careful.
-I'm gonna be very careful.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.649
-I don't like this at all.
-You're very important to me.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.173
I just don't like
walking blind like this.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.088
Well, okay, I think we've
gotten to the point in

29:02.131 --> 29:03.959
our relationship where you can
trust me a month and a half in.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.613
I-I do. I just...
I hate a stubbed toe.

29:05.656 --> 29:06.875
Ooh, your shoulders feel great.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.051
-Oh, thank you.
-Mm.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.270
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.445
Now, you just stay there.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.229
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.102
-Okay.
-Oh, God.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.234
-Am I going back in the closet?
-Oh, they wouldn't accept you.

29:18.278 --> 29:21.237
:
That's mean.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.892
-Okay. And...
-Okay.

29:23.936 --> 29:27.113
Open your eyes. Ta-da!

29:27.156 --> 29:30.116
Your very own closet space.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.335
-Did you... Did you make that?
-I did.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.424
You can put
your sleep shorts here.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.993
And you can hang your pants
on a hanger.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.778
Put them here.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.867
And your wallet and your keys
in the sundries box.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.130
That's where the sundries go.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.305
Merry Christmas.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.701
-You're staring at me.
-Yes.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.402
-I love...
-Love you.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.838
-What the hell?
-Oh.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.753
-That was my line.
-Well, you hesitated.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.885
-You snooze, you lose.
-No.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.234
-I did not hesitate.
-You did.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.583
I was giving the words
room to breathe.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.193
Well, let the record show
I said it first.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.847
Kit, at the very least,

30:05.891 --> 30:07.588
we-we've said it
at the same time.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.502
That's not what
the record shows.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.851
I love you.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.811
I love you, too.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.120
WOMAN :
Dr. Patel to CCU.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.296
Dr. Patel to CCU.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.037
MICHAEL:
Don't worry.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.865
We're not at the bad part yet.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.562
-How's he doing?
-Good.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.999
He's been dozing in and out.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.870
Are you family?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.176
Oh, uh, no. I'm his boyfriend.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.964
Oh, God.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.880
-Are you gonna get that?
-It's his mother.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.882
He told me to call her
and tell her not to come.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.057
I've never even met the woman.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.624
Oh.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.582
Hello?

30:45.626 --> 30:47.758
Hi, Mrs. Cowan.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.760
Yes, this is Michael.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.632
Ausiello.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.503
Yes, Kit's doing fine.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.419
Apparently, it was appendicitis,
but he's doing really well now.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.988
Yes, he told me to tell you
there's no need for you to come.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.606
Oh, shit.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.783
I'll be back.

Hey.

How are you feeling?

31:17.527 --> 31:19.399
Is she coming?

31:19.442 --> 31:20.574
They're driving overnight.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.010

-Yeah.

No, I need you to hide
anything that looks... gay.

31:35.110 --> 31:38.679
You want me
to de-gay your apartment?

31:38.722 --> 31:40.376
Yes, de-gay my apartment.

Vicodin is tasty.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.289
Got the extra strength, baby.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.552
So, uh, uh, Mrs. Cowan,
how was the drive in?

33:52.595 --> 33:55.468
Terrible. I wanted to take
the first bus from Kutztown,

33:55.511 --> 33:58.949
but, oh, no... oh, no,
your father wanted to drive.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.734
He was absolutely insistent.

34:00.777 --> 34:02.866
And, of course,
he got completely lost.

34:02.910 --> 34:06.435
We were practically in Buffalo
when he had to turn back around.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.220
Well, I hear they have

34:08.263 --> 34:10.004
some good wings up in Buffalo.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.617
Wings?
What do you mean, "wings"?

34:15.618 --> 34:17.490
It's Buffalo wing...
chicken wings.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.493
Chicken wings? Chicken wing...
I love chicken wings.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.930
Yeah, I... you know, I was
just referencing Buffalo wings.

34:22.973 --> 34:25.585
That was good. Love that.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.935
So, um, uh, wh-where is Bob?

Bob? You mean my husband?

34:30.503 --> 34:31.982
Oh, uh, y-yes.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.941
I'm sorry. Where's Mr. Cowan?

34:33.984 --> 34:35.943
He's, um, parking the car.
I warn you right now,

34:35.986 --> 34:37.640
-he is in a terrible mood.
-Yeah.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.033
My dad hates the city
with a passion.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.774
Bob. Here we are.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.645
-Ah, there's my ride.
-Christ.

34:42.689 --> 34:45.300
Do you realize how expensive
it is to park in this town?

34:45.344 --> 34:46.997
It is astronomical.

-Get the car.

all those stairs. -Okay.

-We're right at the front
door, though. -This is...

-Honestly.

He seems to be
moving around pretty well,

35:56.110 --> 35:58.199

Yeah.

Uh, no, actually,
I... I-I live in Jersey.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.472
Oh.

36:10.516 --> 36:13.301
But y-you work close by?

36:13.345 --> 36:15.738
Uh, well, not that close.
I-I work in Midtown.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.740
Oh.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.571
So, um, Mike?

36:22.615 --> 36:23.920
Yes.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.531
What do you do?

36:25.574 --> 36:28.229
Uh, well, I'm a journalist.
I-I write about TV.

-Ah. -Oh.
-Yeah.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.450
MARILYN:
How nice.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.975
Do... Do you watch TV?

36:35.018 --> 36:36.455
Yes.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.457
-Koppel.
-Koppel?

36:38.500 --> 36:39.849
Nightline.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.111
-Oh, sure. Ted. Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.591
Do you write about him?

36:43.549 --> 36:44.680
About Koppel?

36:44.724 --> 36:46.378
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, no, I don't...

36:46.421 --> 36:48.336
I don't think I've written
anything about Ted Koppel.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.469
-No? Maybe you should.
-I think you should.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.688
He's not gonna write
about Ted Koppel, guys.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.734
-He writes about big TV shows.
-Oh.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.083
Okay.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.954
Mike, did you want to...
Did you...

36:57.998 --> 36:59.347
Yeah. What if I...
What do you...

36:59.391 --> 37:00.522
Why don't I go get
some lunch or something?

37:00.566 --> 37:02.220
You must be famished.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.439
No. No. No, no, no, no, no,
I've got that covered.

37:04.483 --> 37:07.877

favorite chicken soup.

Oh.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.708
Thanks.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.668
I guess there's really nothing
for me to go get.

37:15.711 --> 37:16.799
Mm-hmm.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.323

Yeah.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.716
How do you guys know each other?

KIT:
Um... hmm.

37:22.501 --> 37:24.546
I'm gonna put the...
I'll put that chicken soup

37:24.590 --> 37:25.678
in the... in the fridge.

-Okay.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.072
Here we go. I'll be back.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.772
-We met at a bar.
-Really?

37:32.815 --> 37:33.990
You met at a bar?

37:34.034 --> 37:35.557
-Yeah.
-I get that.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.995
It's two guys out,
catting around.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.432
Meeting chicks.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.477
You know,
a wingman needs a wingman.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.218
-Am I right, Kitty?
-Uh-huh.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.221
:
Oh, my God.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.093
Um, Bob and I are gonna sleep
on the futon,

37:50.137 --> 37:53.183
so, um, wh-where are the sheets?

37:53.227 --> 37:54.968
-Uh, they're down the hall.
-You know what, I'll-I'll go...

37:55.011 --> 37:56.796
I'll get the sheets for you.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.847
So, your friend from the bar
knows where your sheets are?

38:04.891 --> 38:08.068
Yeah, he's-he's crashed here
a few times on the futon,

38:08.111 --> 38:10.331
so he knows
where the sheets are.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.333
A friend?

38:12.377 --> 38:14.030
KIT:
Yeah. A friend.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.423
MARILYN:
Just a friend?

38:15.467 --> 38:17.295
Yes, Mom. Just a friend.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.821
What is going on here?
Who-who is this guy?

38:21.864 --> 38:24.563
What's happening? Are...
Why is he still here?

38:24.606 --> 38:26.652
I don't understand.
You are acting so weird,

38:26.695 --> 38:28.306
and you don't even
look us in the fa...

38:28.349 --> 38:31.396
-You're acting so weird.
-He's my boyfriend, Mom.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.094
-Your boyfriend?
-Yes.

38:35.095 --> 38:36.618
I'm...

38:37.967 --> 38:40.187
I'm gay.

38:41.144 --> 38:43.277
I'm gay, too.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.149
I am also gay.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.544
I am.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.938
MARILYN:
Why couldn't you tell me that?

38:51.981 --> 38:54.244
Why did you keep it
such a secret?

38:54.288 --> 38:56.508
What, am I some
horrible monster?

38:56.551 --> 38:58.161
-You can't say that to me?
-No, Mom.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.989
You have to just hide it
all the time?

39:00.033 --> 39:01.687
I didn't know how to tell you.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.428
-I didn't know how you'd react.
-I don't understand

39:03.471 --> 39:05.212
-why you would do that.
-It's not an easy thing to...

39:05.255 --> 39:08.084
talk about.
It's not just easy to...

39:10.043 --> 39:11.436
BOB:
I think it's great, Kit.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.700
I think it's great
that you gays...

39:14.743 --> 39:17.659
that you guys have each other
and-and, uh...

39:18.660 --> 39:21.054
We may not look like it,
but we are actually

39:21.097 --> 39:24.666
kind of hip,
your mother and I, and, uh...

39:24.710 --> 39:26.755
We were gonna go to Woodstock,
you know.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.278
Oh, yeah.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.456
We had the tickets,
but we-we didn't go.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.197
I just don't know why
you wouldn't tell me.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.548
I-I call you all the time.
I say, "How are you doing?

39:36.591 --> 39:38.332
What's new? Who are you seeing?"

39:38.376 --> 39:39.681
You could've just said,
"You know what,"

39:39.725 --> 39:40.943
-a long time ago.
-It's hard, Marilyn.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.380
It's-it's-it's hard.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.859
Like I'm an outsider
or something.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.383
Hello, Mike.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.167
Gosh, good to meet you.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.865
It's... it's nice
to meet you, too, Marilyn.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.258
Oh, my God.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.610
It wasn't long
after Bob and Marilyn

39:55.654 --> 39:57.569
went back to Millersburg
that we moved in

39:57.612 --> 40:00.093
to our first apartment together.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.921
Where should this go?

40:01.964 --> 40:04.706
I don't know.
Where should this go?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.055
That's cold as hell.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.318
-That's so moody.
-Dusty rusty.

40:08.362 --> 40:10.320
And it even had
an outdoor space,

-Okay.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.390
Every year, when I was young,

41:20.434 --> 41:21.870
I would lay under the tree

Or it's... maybe it's more like
a Christmas wish,

41:44.719 --> 41:47.243
but that, even when I'm older,

41:47.287 --> 41:51.509
I will lie under the tree
like this with my partner,

41:51.552 --> 41:53.685

-Thank you.

50:15.055 --> 50:16.578
And I'm taking a little cake
for the road.

50:16.622 --> 50:18.145
-Yes, I see.
-A little cake?

50:18.189 --> 50:19.233
-Nick, Jesus.
-Just a little. -A lot of cake.

50:19.277 --> 50:20.278
I'm so happy to have met you.

50:20.321 --> 50:21.670

That was a great party, Mike.

50:40.472 --> 50:41.951
-It was, right?
-Mm-hmm.

50:41.995 --> 50:44.041
It was really nice.

50:45.216 --> 50:46.521
You okay?

50:46.565 --> 50:48.436
Yeah. I'm good.

Are you still good
for Tony on Wednesday?

-Okay.

-Okay.
-Okay.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.019
Kit, what is going on?

51:06.063 --> 51:07.716
-Are you all right?

51:08.717 --> 51:11.024
There's something not right
with my ass.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.809
It feels like I've got
a golf ball lodged up there.

51:13.853 --> 51:15.811
-A golf ball?
-Yeah.

51:15.855 --> 51:18.249
It's probably just
a hemorrhoid or something.

I've booked an appointment.

Of course.

Thank you for coming here today.

-Yes. Really appreciate it.

Congrats on the launch

Oh. Thank you.

Hey. What happened?

52:25.490 --> 52:27.100
KIT:
Uh, they found a growth.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.536
Wait. Uh, wh-what do you mean?

52:28.580 --> 52:29.972
They found a growth in my butt.

52:30.016 --> 52:31.496
Uh, but the doctor said
there are

52:31.539 --> 52:33.019
a hundred things it could be
besides cancer.

52:33.062 --> 52:36.022
I'm having it biopsied
on Friday.

52:36.065 --> 52:38.285
Please, don't worry about it,
Michael. I'm not.

52:38.329 --> 52:41.201
I-I got to go.
I've got to get on the subway.

52:41.245 --> 52:43.682

52:47.773 --> 52:49.818
So, Michael,
how was school today?

52:51.255 --> 52:52.995
It was okay.

52:53.039 --> 52:55.041
We had to pick teams
in gym class,

52:55.084 --> 52:56.869
and they picked me last.

53:02.614 --> 53:03.919
Are you okay, Mom?

53:03.963 --> 53:05.312
Totally fine.

53:07.096 --> 53:09.447
I just need to make
an appointment with the doctor.

53:12.276 --> 53:14.234
Yes, I... Okay, Doctor. Yes.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.802
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll look at the test results.

Hey, turd ball, there's
a matter baby on your chair.

53:23.287 --> 53:25.202
What's a matter baby?

53:25.245 --> 53:28.030
Nothing. What's the matter
with you, baby?

53:38.650 --> 53:41.174
Confirm your name
and birth date for me, please.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.697
Christopher Cowan.

53:42.741 --> 53:44.525
December 23, 1972.

53:46.658 --> 53:48.050
Allergies?

53:48.094 --> 53:50.183
Hot yoga, shareable plates.

53:52.751 --> 53:54.013
Penicillin.

53:59.192 --> 54:01.586
And what's your relationship
to the patient?

54:04.284 --> 54:06.243
The plan is to get in there

54:06.286 --> 54:08.027
and take a piece of it
and send it off for testing.

54:08.070 --> 54:09.289
There's a chance
that you'll go in,

54:09.333 --> 54:10.638
you'll find out it's nothing,

54:10.682 --> 54:11.987
and then we'll just
move on from...

54:12.031 --> 54:13.989
Michael, relax.
Everything's fine.

I'm gonna be fine, okay?

55:04.562 --> 55:06.912
The growth was a lot bigger

apparently the best oncologists
in New York,

-Mm.

58:03.828 --> 58:05.786
Generally speaking,
rectal cancer

58:05.830 --> 58:08.441
is fairly common
and highly treatable.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.225
Christopher, I was telling
your brother when...

58:10.269 --> 58:11.400
No, no, no.
I'm not his brother.

58:11.444 --> 58:12.489
Oh, sorry.

58:12.532 --> 58:14.708
Uh, there are multiple nodules

58:14.752 --> 58:17.798
adjacent to the inferior rectum
which are presumably related

58:17.842 --> 58:20.018
to the neuroendocrine tumor
that was biopsied.

58:20.061 --> 58:21.541
Well, you sound optimistic.

58:21.585 --> 58:23.587
There's definitely room
for optimism here.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.632
With a neuroendocrine tumor,

58:25.676 --> 58:28.505
particularly with what I see
in the pathology report,

58:28.548 --> 58:30.550
it's very amenable to therapy.

58:30.594 --> 58:32.334
So this is not one of
the more aggressive ones?

58:32.378 --> 58:36.208
Correct. Neuroendocrine tumors
are not, uh, aggressive.

58:36.251 --> 58:38.210
So, take a deep breath.

58:38.253 --> 58:40.560
MICHAEL:
It was beginning to seem like

58:40.604 --> 58:43.563
we might dodge a worst-case
cancer diagnosis.

58:43.607 --> 58:46.392
And as if to seal the deal,
our final doctor looked like

58:46.435 --> 58:48.481
she stepped straight out
of hair and makeup

58:48.525 --> 58:50.570
and onto the set of a TV show.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.006
A good one.

58:52.050 --> 58:53.530
I was in love with her.

58:55.357 --> 58:57.359
Until she opened her mouth.

58:57.403 --> 58:59.187
You have an extremely
aggressive form

58:59.231 --> 59:00.972
of neuroendocrine cancer.

59:02.756 --> 59:04.715
Your tumor is what we call
high-grade.

59:04.758 --> 59:06.194
I'm sorry, what?

59:06.238 --> 59:08.022
If you decide to get
your treatment here,

59:08.066 --> 59:09.720
I would like to start
as soon as possible.

59:09.763 --> 59:11.765
The other doctors
that we talked to,

59:11.809 --> 59:13.767
they said that this wasn't
the aggressive kind.

59:13.811 --> 59:15.639
And they're wrong.

59:15.682 --> 59:18.032
And his is already
at a very advanced stage.

59:18.076 --> 59:19.686
What stage are we talking?

59:19.730 --> 59:21.383
Stage four.

59:23.690 --> 59:25.170
I'm sorry.

59:32.743 --> 59:35.920
How soon should he start
treatment?

59:35.963 --> 59:39.924
DR. LUCAS: Ideally, Monday, uh,
he would start chemotherapy.

1:00:36.763 --> 1:00:38.809
What I always get.

1:00:40.114 --> 1:00:41.768
Okay.

Oh.

1:00:58.742 --> 1:00:59.917
No.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:01.658

1:01:05.052 --> 1:01:07.707

she's getting worried.

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.884
She doesn't even know

1:01:11.885 --> 1:01:14.192

drive down there this weekend.

-I can make you snacks.

No, I was just checking
the fridge.

1:04:13.632 --> 1:04:15.068
We-we got some sandwiches
at the gas station, so...

1:04:15.112 --> 1:04:16.765
-From a gas station?
-They were fine.

He hears you. He's coming.

1:04:26.732 --> 1:04:28.647
Oh, why didn't you just give me
some time to clean up?

1:04:28.690 --> 1:04:30.170
-You call and say you're
on your way. -It's clean.

1:04:30.214 --> 1:04:31.519
You just have to give me
just a little bit

1:04:31.563 --> 1:04:32.912
-of notice, you know.
-It's fine.

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:34.348
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

-Hello, you handsome devil.
-Hey, Dad.

1:04:36.568 --> 1:04:38.048
Hi, Kitty.
How are you? How are you?

1:04:38.091 --> 1:04:39.310
-Good to see you.
-How are you? Good to see you.

1:04:39.353 --> 1:04:40.877
-Hey, Bob.
-Equally handsome devil.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:42.487
-Thank you very much.
That's very kind. -Hello!

1:04:42.530 --> 1:04:44.968
-Um, Michael, I love this coat.
-Oh, thank you.

1:04:45.011 --> 1:04:47.144
Is it camel hair?
Because I'm hearing

1:04:47.187 --> 1:04:49.711
that camel hair is-is very...
is big this season.

1:04:49.755 --> 1:04:51.452
-I think it... I think it's...
-Camel hair?!

1:04:51.496 --> 1:04:53.106
You wouldn't know camel hair
from a hole in the ground.

1:04:53.150 --> 1:04:54.803
-I have some style.
-What do you mean, camel hair?

1:04:54.847 --> 1:04:56.283
-You do, Bob. You have style.
-Style?

1:04:56.327 --> 1:04:57.806
-Thank you, Michael.
-Look at you. My God.

1:04:57.850 --> 1:04:59.069
-And you wear it well.
-Totally cisgender.

1:04:59.112 --> 1:05:00.548
Dad, let me help you
with those bags.

1:05:00.592 --> 1:05:01.723
The last coat you got
was from JCPenney,

1:05:01.767 --> 1:05:03.421
for goodness' sakes.

1:05:03.464 --> 1:05:05.249
...like, a camera situated
right on the runway.

1:05:05.292 --> 1:05:07.164
-See? You can see there.
A-And you... -MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.

1:05:07.207 --> 1:05:08.992
I mean, you can just
watch planes

1:05:09.035 --> 1:05:10.863
take off and land all day long.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:12.734
-Oh, look at that.
-Which he does.

1:05:12.778 --> 1:05:15.085
-Uh, Mare, I do not.
-You do, too.

1:05:15.128 --> 1:05:17.174
Well, I mean,
it is in real time.

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:20.438
Look, it's, uh...
the little Cessna CTT.

1:05:20.481 --> 1:05:22.657
-Very nice.
-Hold out... Hold out your arm.

1:05:22.701 --> 1:05:25.008
He's not high-style
like a... like a Learjet.

1:05:25.051 --> 1:05:27.010
-Oh, you're knitting me
a sweater. -MICHAEL: Right.

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:31.275
Last week was this great,
big race in Toledo.

1:05:31.318 --> 1:05:33.973
Which is a really nice town.
I'd never been before.

1:05:34.017 --> 1:05:35.932
It's-it's known
for glass factories,

1:05:35.975 --> 1:05:37.890
but who knows if that's
actually true?

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:40.153
Listen, you boys should come
one year. It's so much fun.

1:05:40.197 --> 1:05:42.199
Oh, they take over
the whole town, too.

1:05:42.242 --> 1:05:44.027
-We take over the whole town.
-Yeah. It's true.

1:05:44.070 --> 1:05:45.593
-Go ahead, Mare.
-Anyway, this woman I know,

1:05:45.637 --> 1:05:47.117
Trish O'Neil,

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:48.988
who won the race,
she's in my age-group, but...

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:51.599
-Wins races all the time.
-So, the race starts.

1:05:51.643 --> 1:05:54.994
I saw her for the first
five miles of the bike ride,

1:05:55.038 --> 1:05:57.736
'cause she and I were riding
fairly close together.

1:05:57.779 --> 1:06:00.173
And then after that,
she just kind of disappears.

1:06:00.217 --> 1:06:02.175
-Oh.
-Huh.

1:06:02.219 --> 1:06:04.047
I don't see her the whole
rest of the race.

1:06:04.090 --> 1:06:06.440
Did you like the rosé,
Michael? Is it...

1:06:06.484 --> 1:06:07.876
-Oh, yes, I love this.
-Good.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:09.791
I love all rosé,
but this is very good.

1:06:09.835 --> 1:06:12.707
Last mile of the race--

1:06:12.751 --> 1:06:14.709
da-dum!-- she reappears.

1:06:14.753 --> 1:06:16.842
-She cheated.
-You know, with not one single

1:06:16.885 --> 1:06:18.409
drop of sweat on her,

1:06:18.452 --> 1:06:20.367
she just trots across
the finish line--

1:06:20.411 --> 1:06:21.586
-the winner!
-Yeah.

1:06:23.370 --> 1:06:26.504
And we were all very upset.

1:06:29.115 --> 1:06:30.508
:
So...

1:06:30.551 --> 1:06:32.031
You know what,
we have been talking

1:06:32.075 --> 1:06:33.728
-a blue streak...
-No.

1:06:33.772 --> 1:06:35.208
...ever since
you guys got here.

1:06:35.252 --> 1:06:37.297
-Yeah, so... so...
-Wonderful.

1:06:38.342 --> 1:06:40.561
Honestly, uh, what's going on
with you guys?

1:06:43.086 --> 1:06:44.478
Um...

1:06:49.614 --> 1:06:51.485
Um...

1:06:51.529 --> 1:06:53.183
I don't know where to start.

1:06:56.012 --> 1:06:59.319
Uh, about two or three
months ago,

1:06:59.363 --> 1:07:03.106
I started experiencing
a lot of pain

1:07:03.149 --> 1:07:05.151
when going to the bathroom.

1:07:05.195 --> 1:07:07.153
:
And, uh...

1:07:12.202 --> 1:07:14.813
We thought there were
a lot of things it could be.

1:07:14.856 --> 1:07:16.945
How many doctors have you seen?

1:07:16.989 --> 1:07:18.730
We saw three.

1:07:18.773 --> 1:07:21.689
It was the longest
20 minutes of my life.

1:07:23.735 --> 1:07:26.259
I'll never forget how brave
you were telling them.

1:07:34.311 --> 1:07:36.748
Obviously,
you're gonna fight it.

1:07:38.924 --> 1:07:40.795
And you'll beat it.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:44.712
Yeah.

1:07:44.756 --> 1:07:46.279

1:07:46.323 --> 1:07:48.238

-I'd love cake.

Here, let me do it.
It's all right.

1:07:49.978 --> 1:07:51.154
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1:07:51.197 --> 1:07:53.199
I'll just... Okay.

1:07:53.243 --> 1:07:54.896

1:08:09.781 --> 1:08:13.132
I didn't sleep
one wink last night.

1:08:13.176 --> 1:08:15.178
Not one single wink.

1:08:15.221 --> 1:08:17.528
Everything kept rolling around
in my head.

1:08:17.571 --> 1:08:19.530
Just racing around and around.

1:08:22.837 --> 1:08:25.318
Oh. Right.

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:27.059
I mean, it's just so insulting.

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:28.539
-Right.
-Like a...

1:08:28.582 --> 1:08:31.063
like a big middle finger
to the rest of us.

1:08:31.107 --> 1:08:33.326
I mean, there we are,
pushing ourselves

1:08:33.370 --> 1:08:36.155
as hard as we can,
and-and honestly...

1:08:36.199 --> 1:08:38.375
honestly, for what?

1:08:38.418 --> 1:08:39.593
For what?

1:08:39.637 --> 1:08:40.942
I don't know. For-for what?

1:08:40.986 --> 1:08:43.467
Just to see if we can.

1:08:43.510 --> 1:08:45.817
-Oh, sure. Yeah, that.
-If we can do it.

1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:47.427
I mean, there's no glory in it.

1:08:47.471 --> 1:08:49.081
There's certainly
no money in it.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.952
-It's-it's killing my knees.

1:08:50.996 --> 1:08:52.476
But-but I just do it.

1:08:52.519 --> 1:08:53.825
Well, you should take it easy
on your knees.

1:08:53.868 --> 1:08:55.435
And then someone like Trish
shows up,

1:08:55.479 --> 1:08:57.437
who hasn't got a clue. She...

1:08:57.481 --> 1:08:59.874
Honestly, what race
does she think she's running?

1:08:59.918 --> 1:09:02.181
She thinks she can just bypass
all the hard parts?

1:09:02.225 --> 1:09:05.271
Well, you can't. You have to
run the race in front of you,

1:09:05.315 --> 1:09:07.055
because that's all there is.

1:09:07.099 --> 1:09:08.927
-Marilyn, do you want to...
-You do the best you can.

1:09:08.970 --> 1:09:12.148
But she thinks... she thinks
you can cheat all of that.

1:09:12.191 --> 1:09:14.106
And I'm here to tell you,
if you cheat,

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:15.760
you're going to get caught.

1:09:15.803 --> 1:09:17.979

-First question:

1:40:18.490 --> 1:40:22.146
Your character on the show
has been very popular,

1:40:22.190 --> 1:40:24.235
and everyone hates
to see you go,

1:40:24.279 --> 1:40:27.760

1:40:40.121 --> 1:40:44.560

And how do you feel right now?

1:40:47.606 --> 1:40:49.565
Ooh. Uh, great question.

1:40:51.784 --> 1:40:55.527

1:41:32.956 --> 1:41:34.958

And eventually, he did.

1:42:40.589 --> 1:42:43.069
But not in the way
I feared he would.

1:42:43.113 --> 1:42:45.202
He broke it open in a way

1:42:45.246 --> 1:42:48.945
that somehow made room
for even more love,

1:42:48.988 --> 1:42:51.948
both to receive and to give.

you'll understand me

1:42:56.039 --> 1:43:00.783
when I say that this ride
with Kit was, to me, a gift.

1:43:01.958 --> 1:43:06.180
It was the greatest honor
I believe I will ever have,

1:43:06.223 --> 1:43:09.574
to have been by his side
for it all.

1:43:17.191 --> 1:43:20.498
:
Okay. Hey, Marilyn.

1:43:20.542 --> 1:43:23.197
I need to breathe.
I need to breathe.

1:43:27.244 --> 1:43:29.333
Oh, it's a car.

1:43:33.468 --> 1:43:36.210
Oh, God.

1:43:42.259 --> 1:43:44.696
I think he would've liked
your eulogy.

1:43:49.179 --> 1:43:51.529
I think he would've thought
it was too long.

1:43:51.573 --> 1:43:54.228
-Well, probably.

1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:00.451
MICHAEL:
What are you gonna do next?

1:44:00.495 --> 1:44:04.194
I mean, besides triathlons.

1:44:05.804 --> 1:44:08.242
I've never been to Spain,
and I always...

1:44:08.285 --> 1:44:12.550
I always wanted to see
that funny-looking museum.

1:44:12.594 --> 1:44:14.770
-Oh, the Guggenheim in Bilbao?
-Yes. Yes.

1:44:14.813 --> 1:44:16.206
Yes, that's funny.

1:44:16.250 --> 1:44:18.164
In the pictures,
it looks like a big ship.

1:44:18.208 --> 1:44:19.470
It does look like a ship.

1:44:19.514 --> 1:44:20.950
-Do you think?
-Yeah, it does.

1:44:22.995 --> 1:44:25.128
MARILYN:
I don't know, I'd just...

1:44:25.171 --> 1:44:27.304
like to get away for a while.

1:44:27.348 --> 1:44:29.915
MICHAEL:
That sounds really nice.

1:44:29.959 --> 1:44:31.830
New scenery to run in.

1:44:33.484 --> 1:44:35.181
Yeah, all the running
stays the same

1:44:35.225 --> 1:44:38.228
-if my knees hold on.
-Mm.

1:44:40.012 --> 1:44:41.405
Race you to the house.

1:44:41.449 --> 1:44:42.624
MICHAEL:
Okay.

1:44:45.366 --> 1:44:47.585
♪

1:45:10.173 --> 1:45:12.958
The hardest thing
about a story ending

1:45:13.002 --> 1:45:17.485
is that you have to say goodbye
to your favorite characters.

1:45:17.528 --> 1:45:19.530
To your favorite people.

1:45:20.836 --> 1:45:23.099
A good TV show
can make real life

1:45:23.142 --> 1:45:25.319
seem like it makes sense.

1:45:25.362 --> 1:45:28.670
And a good ending can feel like
the end of one thing

1:45:28.713 --> 1:45:30.976
and the beginning of another.

1:45:32.151 --> 1:45:34.850
Sometimes the hero dies.

1:45:34.893 --> 1:45:37.156
Sometimes we only get
14 Christmas trees

1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:39.550
when we thought we'd have 40.

1:45:42.336 --> 1:45:44.294
And then an old friend
reminded me

1:45:44.338 --> 1:45:46.470
that sometimes
the main character

1:45:46.514 --> 1:45:48.124
has to take a leap of faith

1:45:48.167 --> 1:45:50.822
that involves packing a suitcase

1:45:50.866 --> 1:45:52.911
and traveling
across the country.

1:45:54.826 --> 1:45:58.177
I don't know.
Maybe that's too on the nose.

1:46:21.462 --> 1:46:23.594
-Hi.
-Where we going?

1:46:23.638 --> 1:46:25.291
Uh, JFK.

1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.949
Where you off to?

1:46:30.993 --> 1:46:32.951
Los Angeles.

1:46:32.995 --> 1:46:36.346
Oof. That 405, man.

1:46:36.390 --> 1:46:38.827
That thing takes
no prisoners, huh?

1:46:38.870 --> 1:46:40.916
I wanted our story to be

1:46:40.959 --> 1:46:44.049
a picture-perfect,
happy-ending love story.

1:46:46.835 --> 1:46:49.925
But what we got
was a real love story.

1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:53.407
