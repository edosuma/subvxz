What'd I miss?

00:05.309 --> 00:07.268
There was this big flash,
some fire shot out,

00:07.355 --> 00:08.486
and now he's
just coming to.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.097
What?! I was only gone
for a second!

00:10.184 --> 00:12.403
Shh! I want to see this.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.014
Oh, for God's sake, Hal!

00:14.101 --> 00:16.451
Pay the money
and get a repairman.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.236
I am not wasting good money

We don't know how
we're going to pay for it,

to find a way.

Reese, don't you think
it's even a little bit sad

01:31.874 --> 01:33.571
to become a janitor
at your own high school?

01:33.658 --> 01:37.445
Assistant janitor;
all mop and no paperwork.

01:37.532 --> 01:38.837
Okay, I've packed all your
winter clothes,

01:38.924 --> 01:41.318
your comic books
and half your knickknacks.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.494
Guess what. We have the same
Quiet Riot CD,

01:43.581 --> 01:44.843

01:44.930 --> 01:46.323
Stop calling me that.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.803
I'm not your roommate
for another two weeks.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.370
12 days!

01:49.457 --> 01:50.719
The second you graduate,
you are out

01:50.806 --> 01:51.720
of this house and into his.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.203
What other jobs
can you get?

01:56.290 --> 01:57.639
I've already got three shifts
in the cafeteria,

01:57.726 --> 01:59.293
Monday and Wednesday
at the bookstore

01:59.380 --> 02:00.555
and mopping the dorms at night.

02:00.642 --> 02:01.556
I don't know, I guess I could

02:01.643 --> 02:02.644
chop vegetables during chem lab.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.385
This is outrageous!

02:04.472 --> 02:06.300
Kids with half your brains
are getting full rides!

02:06.387 --> 02:07.910
They didn't correct
their interviewer

02:07.997 --> 02:09.172
on his pronunciation
of "Sarte."

02:09.258 --> 02:11.000
-Sartre.
-I don't care.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.437
We will find
the money somehow.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.659
This is as good a time
as any to talk about it.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.487
I do have a private life.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.489
I'll keep it confined
to my own room,

02:21.576 --> 02:24.056
but you should probably
know my safe word.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.712
It's weird to
think about.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.453
Pretty soon you guys
will be gone.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.367
Yeah.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.803
And this...

02:31.890 --> 02:33.631
just sitting around
hanging out...

02:33.718 --> 02:36.243
We're not going to have
many more of these.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.375
[chuckles]:
No, we sure won't.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.637
Seems like
only yesterday

02:39.724 --> 02:42.205
you and I were going
to homecoming,

02:42.292 --> 02:43.467
putting the school
paper to bed

02:43.554 --> 02:44.990

big date

02:45.077 --> 02:47.079
with Sharon Hines.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.561
Mm, that kiss
went on forever.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.824
Uh, Mr. Kenarban,
Stevie's supposed to help me
work on my speech.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.739
Right, right.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.525
Mr. Valedictorian.
Congratulations again.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.396
I'm glad my son
can help you out

02:59.483 --> 03:02.007
with your big,
important speech.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.532
It's probably that selflessness
that got him the second spot.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.011
Dad!

03:06.098 --> 03:07.230
I'm not insulting
salutatorian.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.493
It's quite an honor.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.104
I'm just glad that even
after I got Cedric Hampton

03:12.192 --> 03:13.628
to be the school's
commencement speaker,

03:13.715 --> 03:15.891
they still had
the integrity to make you

03:15.978 --> 03:18.328
valedictorian
and not my crippled son.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.810
Go!

03:21.897 --> 03:24.595
I wonder if moving out and being
on my own is going to change me?

03:24.682 --> 03:26.380
Do you think I'll get
a British accent?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.469
Absolutely.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.079
Hey, wait.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.429
-You know what us
moving out means.
-What?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.388
We can get rid
of the nuclear option.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.041
-Oh, my God.
-You're right.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.789
What's the... nuclear option?

03:45.964 --> 03:47.052
Evidence of the worst thing

03:47.139 --> 03:48.663
we ever did.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.711
MALCOLM:
This is what made sure

03:53.798 --> 03:55.713
that no matter how bad we
screwed each other over,

03:55.800 --> 03:58.281
there was always a limit.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.848
None of us could
push anyone

03:59.935 --> 04:01.719
to a point where they
had nothing to lose.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.634
Or they'd just pull the trigger
and destroy all of us.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.420
How bad... can it be?

04:06.507 --> 04:10.467
One time we made Mom think
she had cancer.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.252
But we had a really good reason.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
Stop saying it'll
be all right!

04:15.385 --> 04:17.517
You'll never be able
to raise them alone!

04:17.605 --> 04:20.825
Um... Mom, I know
this is a bad time,

04:20.911 --> 04:22.610
but can you sign these
report cards?

[sobbing]

04:24.525 --> 04:26.091
[Hal sobbing]

04:26.178 --> 04:27.397
It's not like
we're proud of it.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.746
I mean, we were
proud of it,

04:28.833 --> 04:30.139
but we're not
proud of it now.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.446
The point is,
we can get rid of it.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.795
Dewey, I think
you should do this.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.057
Really?

04:35.144 --> 04:37.015
Me?

04:37.102 --> 04:39.017
You're going to be the oldest
around here soon.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.367
It'll be good
for your maturity.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.716
This is your show.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.370
Make us proud.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.589
I always pictured
this day coming,

04:45.676 --> 04:46.982
except both of you
were dead.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.724
What the heck,
it still feels great.

04:51.465 --> 04:55.251
I am begging you.
I just need $5,000.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.123
You think I would be calling
you if I wasn't desperate?

04:58.210 --> 05:01.301
Look, I know how much
you hate me.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.607
But, no kidding,
I'm at rock bottom.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.696
I've got no money,
no prospects

05:05.783 --> 05:08.090
and nowhere else to turn.

05:08.177 --> 05:12.181
Well... can I speak
to a seniorloan officer?

05:14.183 --> 05:17.360
So, 3:15 you make the last
round of the bathrooms.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.493
Toilet 12 is a bit
of a diva.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.451
Then you rinse your mop
in hot water

05:21.538 --> 05:23.671
and disinfectant, and you
hang it on a yellow peg.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.063
Any questions?

05:25.150 --> 05:27.675
Yeah. Why would you
ever go home?

05:27.762 --> 05:30.765
This job is better
than I could ever imagine.

05:30.852 --> 05:34.769
A cool uniform, the power
to cordon off wet floors.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.379
You're not just some
creepy loner

05:36.466 --> 05:39.121
hanging around the school,
you're the janitor.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.383
Don't get too
excited, kid.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.863
You'll be gone
after 30 days.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.821
Oh, no, I am really
committed to this.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.606
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

05:45.693 --> 05:46.911
This is a union gig.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.435
Once you get past

05:48.522 --> 05:50.524
the 30-day probation,
you're locked for life.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.352
Full benefits, medical,
everything.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.657
So they never

05:53.744 --> 05:55.833
keep a new guy
for more than a month.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.618
Hey, I'm sorry, kid.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.315
You really seem to be
a natural at this.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.534
I've never seen
anybody

06:00.621 --> 06:01.970
take to garbage
the way you do.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.798
There's got to be some way.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.366
I mean... I mean, what
if there was a mess--

06:06.453 --> 06:10.282
a mess that was so big
and sticky and disgusting

06:10.370 --> 06:13.068
that it was impossible to clean
up in less than 30 days?

06:13.155 --> 06:15.679
It's a beautiful thought, kid.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.681
But there's no such thing
as a 30-day mess.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.816
Yeah?

06:21.903 --> 06:24.471
Well, they also said
they'd never put a man on Mars.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.651
Sorry we're late.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.435
You wouldn't believe the fight
we got in over shower curtains.

06:32.522 --> 06:33.741
Those dolphins were gay.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.438
You think all dolphins are gay.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.483
All dolphins aregay.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.485
Dolphins can
kill sharks.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.400
Gay guys can kill sharks,
and they're still gay.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.401
Can we begin?

06:46.580 --> 06:50.018
With this fire, a terrible
secret that bound us together

06:50.105 --> 06:51.759
is gone forever.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.717
Jamie will grow up
in a world

06:53.804 --> 06:55.937
without the fear that haunted
every second of our lives.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.895
He'll learn to give
birthday presents

06:57.982 --> 06:59.854
out of love, not blackmail,

06:59.941 --> 07:01.812
and to share out of
the generosity of his heart,

07:01.899 --> 07:03.771
not the dread
in the pit of his stomach.

07:03.858 --> 07:04.989
With this fire,

07:05.076 --> 07:06.556
a curse is lifted

07:06.643 --> 07:08.558
and a brilliant
new dawn is born.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.994
ALL: Amen.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.343
[loud crackling]

07:15.086 --> 07:17.001
Nice touch.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.702
You know, if you want me
to take a look

07:21.789 --> 07:23.138
at your valedictory speech,
I'd be happy to.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.401
Mom, stop it.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.926
-I don't want anyone
to see it until it's ready.
-Fine.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.407
But if you ever want
some fresh ears...

07:31.494 --> 07:33.191
No, I'm really
happy with it.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.062
Just let me do this.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.717
Okay, okay.

07:36.804 --> 07:39.459
But why are you quoting a rap
group when there are people

07:39.546 --> 07:42.418
like Paul McCartney out there
who are just as relevant

07:42.505 --> 07:44.464
and don't go around showing off
the tops of their underpants?

07:52.210 --> 07:54.299
[coughing and gagging]

07:54.386 --> 07:56.214
It's a start.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.334
Susan, I'm sorry.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.597
Mom just bullied me
into giving her

08:30.684 --> 08:33.034
our last ticket for graduation.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.905
Because the last time
I stood up to her

08:34.991 --> 08:37.604
someone dumped a pig's head
down our chimney.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.562
Besides, she's already
on her way.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.259
She's driving down
with Francis and Piama.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.001
[pounding on door]

08:44.087 --> 08:46.700
Lois, I really think he's
going to do it this time!
You've got to stop him!

08:48.440 --> 08:49.746
There you are.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.226
I drove by 80 miles
of blunt objects

08:51.313 --> 08:52.357
just to get to you.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.273
I hope you run!

08:55.360 --> 08:59.669
You better make that first swing
count, Princess.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.063
Hi, Mom.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.413
Finish your cigarette
and I'll make you some lunch.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.110
Come on, you can help me
make your beds.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.637
You had to make
a speech first, didn't you?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.769
-Hal...
-Right.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.642
Son, don't feel bad.

09:15.729 --> 09:19.254
In some parallel universe,
you did it.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.212
Oh, no.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.605
They canceled
my Pierson Grant.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.912
That was $3,000!

09:24.999 --> 09:27.001
They're using the money
to do a study

09:27.088 --> 09:29.699
on what happens to kids
who can't afford college.

09:29.786 --> 09:33.050
They're offering me $50
to be a part of it.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.232
Show it to me.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.756
It's beautiful, Grandma.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.192
I just cracked the lid
a quarter inch

09:44.279 --> 09:46.324
and it burned off
all the hair in my nose.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.413
-Good. Who takes the fall?
-Huh?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.806
Your patsy...
who is your patsy?

09:51.286 --> 09:53.114
It's a good thing
you called me.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.898
If you're going to make
this big mess,

09:54.985 --> 09:57.031
they're going
to blame someone.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.510
And you can make it

09:58.598 --> 09:59.642
anyone you want.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.644
A teacher, a neighbor.

10:01.731 --> 10:04.299
If you're lucky,
a whole family goes down.

10:04.386 --> 10:05.605
And you get

10:05.692 --> 10:07.432
to sell their dog.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.521
-You are amazing.
-Well...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.262
If you ever brushed your teeth,
I would kiss you.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.402
You want $8,000.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.273
Yes.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.406
All right, the way this works is

10:24.493 --> 10:25.407
you come back next week...

10:25.494 --> 10:26.669
That won't be necessary.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.062
I'm not going
to pay you back.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.803
Hear me out.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.806
There's no way I can get
the money to pay you, but

10:32.893 --> 10:34.677
instead of making
you go through

10:34.764 --> 10:37.245
that whole, stupid charade
where you keep calling me

10:37.332 --> 10:40.248
and I keep making lame excuses
until you hunt me down,

10:40.335 --> 10:44.600
I am willing to go straight
to the leg-breaking.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.645
Really?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.995
Yes. Whenever you say,

10:48.082 --> 10:50.388
I just show up and you start
snapping bones.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.520
Arms, legs, whatever.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.522
Invite anyone you want.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.525
I promise, I will scream
and cry and beg for mercy,

10:56.612 --> 10:58.570
and make it so loud
and so horrible

10:58.658 --> 10:59.876
that no one who sees it

10:59.963 --> 11:02.096
will ever
miss another payment again.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.534
Now, you can't buy
that kind of publicity.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.191
Couldn't I just
not give you the money

11:10.278 --> 11:11.845
and still break
your arms and legs?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.977
Wouldn't that accomplish
the same thing?

11:16.414 --> 11:21.681
True. But... then I think your
point starts to get muddled.

11:22.899 --> 11:26.207
Maybe we should sleep on it.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.605
Will you straighten up
those magazines?

11:33.693 --> 11:34.998
The Kenarbans will
be here any minute

11:35.085 --> 11:36.521
and I don't want
their fancy friend

11:36.608 --> 11:38.045
to think he's
visiting a hobo camp.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.829
Yeah, Mom,
let's all jump through hoops

11:39.916 --> 11:41.526
so the big corporate fat cat

11:41.613 --> 11:43.224
doesn't have
to see anything real.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.486
You know, Francis,
it wouldn't hurt you

11:44.573 --> 11:45.966
to jump through a hoop or two.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.445
Are you even
still looking for a job?

11:47.532 --> 11:48.708
As a matter
of fact...

11:48.795 --> 11:51.101
As a matter of fact,
I don't have to.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.277
I got a lot of irons
in the fire right now.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.018
I got three different ideas
for children's books,

11:55.105 --> 11:57.673
and I'm considering applying
for a bounty hunter's license.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.457
Are you insane?!

11:59.544 --> 12:01.372
In what world is that
even remotel...?

12:03.026 --> 12:04.549
Piama, will you help me
get the good china?

12:04.636 --> 12:06.203
out of the closet?

12:09.250 --> 12:13.080
I love finally having
an excuse to use these.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.038
I took them out once
when that congressman

12:15.125 --> 12:16.779
was going door to door,
but he just

12:16.866 --> 12:17.737
clogged up
our toilet and left.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.176
By the way, Mom,
I think it's high time

12:22.263 --> 12:23.525
we cleared the air
about that day

12:23.612 --> 12:26.049
you threw away my Harlem
Globetrotters autographs.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.138
Harlem who? What are
you talking about?

12:28.225 --> 12:30.575
I'm not saying there
was definitely some unconscious

12:30.662 --> 12:32.664
racism going on, but I do
think someone could benefit

12:32.752 --> 12:35.493
from a little self-examination
in a quiet moment.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.800
Dewey, can I see you
in your room for a second?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.717
[doorbell rings]

12:43.893 --> 12:45.765
Hi! How are you...

12:45.852 --> 12:48.811
Okay, it's pretty obvious
I just saved your ass.
Now I want to know why.

12:53.033 --> 12:56.210
So right when we walk
in, I fake a seizure.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.822
When I fall, I make sure my
skirt comes up over my hips.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.738
I'm going commando, so
you'll have plenty of time

13:02.825 --> 13:04.305
to sneak this
out of the car.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.002
I love you, Grandma.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.570
You're a good boy.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.094
Are you kidding me? That whole
cancer scare was fake?!

13:11.181 --> 13:14.097
I played cards with her
in the hospital for no reason?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.533
Why didn't you
just get rid of this?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.144
I don't know.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.581
I couldn't. The thought
of destroying it

13:19.668 --> 13:21.931
just made me... sad.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.846
I get it, Dewey.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.500
You love your brothers.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.197
You didn't have much
to keep you together,

13:27.284 --> 13:29.199
but you had this.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.767
And now I have this.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.074
Something really horrible
to blackmail you guys with

13:34.161 --> 13:35.553
that I'm totally clean on.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.599
-Mom's friend Jenny.
-We're good.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.210
So Mr. Hampton,

13:40.297 --> 13:41.821
you got all the
subroutines, the GUI,

13:41.908 --> 13:43.170
all of that into 16K?

13:43.257 --> 13:44.954
I can't get a Boolean
sort in that.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.522
You youngsters are spoiled
by all that cheap RAM.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.437
When I started out,
I had an 8-bit bus

13:49.524 --> 13:52.353
that ran at 4.7 megahertz,
and I was happy to have it.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.702
This is fantastic.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.008
I haven't understood
a word you've said

13:55.095 --> 13:56.487
for the last ten minutes.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.011
Oh, you don't have
to be that impressed.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.361
Sure, now he owns
a GulfStream jet

14:00.448 --> 14:02.537
and a baseball team,
but there was a time

14:02.624 --> 14:06.280
when this guy's name
was Accident Pants.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.934
Remember that?
Remember that?

14:08.021 --> 14:09.979
I remember somebody
begging me for a loan.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.634
Remember that?
Remember that?

14:12.721 --> 14:15.158
Now, listen, I'm really
not here to socialize.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.116
I've seen some
of the programming

14:16.203 --> 14:17.378
you boys have done.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.162
The server-to-server
algorithm.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.685
The evolution simulator--
that's all good stuff.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.079
He thinks...

14:23.166 --> 14:25.734
we're geniuses.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.344
Well, good enough for a two-year
contract, anyway.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.043
Full benefits, stock options.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.435
We're talking
six figures-- each.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.047
Oh, my God!

14:34.134 --> 14:35.875
Wait, how many is six?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.702
I'm not being charitable.
I'm locking you in

14:37.789 --> 14:40.357
while you're still cheap,
but I need an answer right now.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.881
Otherwise it's not
worth it to me.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.752
-Well, I...
-That's a very generous offer,

14:43.839 --> 14:45.754
-Mr. Hampton, but no.
-Mom, what are you...?

14:45.841 --> 14:47.930
Malcolm's going to college, he's
going to finish his education.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.498
-But thank you very much.
-He wasn't asking you, he was...

14:50.585 --> 14:53.196
Ma'am, I completely
understand. I should have
talked to you first.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.459
Consider the offer withdrawn.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.070
Sorry, kid. 24/7 job.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.375
You'd need your whole family
behind you.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.942
And don't be mad at your mom.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.770
She's only trying
to look out for you.

15:01.857 --> 15:05.034
Who knows how far I would've
gone if I went to college?

15:09.821 --> 15:11.475
[gurgling]

15:11.562 --> 15:13.390
What's that noise?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.044
Nothing, Dad.
Just a little hungry.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.916
[gurgling]

15:19.266 --> 15:20.963
All right, Malcolm,
I know you're angry.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.965
You might as well say
what you have to now

15:23.052 --> 15:24.445
and get it out
of your system.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.277
[loud sloshing]

15:37.414 --> 15:39.416
I'm so sorry, Jamie.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.331
I didn't know I had you
hanging upside down

15:41.418 --> 15:43.681
until that last layer
of gunk came off.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.555
Well, we might as well
go ahead and have kids.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.513
I'm not afraid of changing
diapers anymore.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.688
Good job, Reese.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.908
Hey, I am the victim here!

15:52.995 --> 15:54.301
Those are my
hopes and dreams

15:54.388 --> 15:55.432
you're scrubbing
out of your cracks!

15:55.519 --> 15:59.262
Anybody else hungry?

15:59.349 --> 16:00.350
MALCOLM:
You know what?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.830
I'm glad!

16:01.917 --> 16:03.179
This is appropriate.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.313
Now my life looks
exactly how I feel.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.837
How could you
screw me over like that?

16:08.924 --> 16:10.360
Because you were
going to take that job,

16:10.447 --> 16:12.972
and we are not going to let you
throw your life away.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.670
How is being rich
throwing my life away?!

16:15.757 --> 16:18.194
Because it's not the life
you're supposed to have!

16:18.281 --> 16:19.979
The life you're supposed
to have is you go to Harvard

16:20.066 --> 16:22.938
and you earn every fellowship
and internship they have.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.374
You graduate first
in your class,

16:24.461 --> 16:26.420
and you start working
in public service--

16:26.507 --> 16:27.856
either district attorney
or running some foundation--

16:27.943 --> 16:30.119
and then you become governor
of a mid-sized state

16:30.206 --> 16:31.642
and then you
become president.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.644
What?!

16:33.731 --> 16:35.037
Of the United States.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.560
Dad?

16:36.647 --> 16:38.345
I'm sorry, son. It's true.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.784
I thought you knew.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.264
Our expectations
started out

16:44.351 --> 16:46.222
much smaller, but you
just kept upping the ante.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.484
What if I don't

16:47.571 --> 16:49.356
-want to be president?
-It's too late

16:49.443 --> 16:50.357
for that.
You're gonna do it.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.054
Oh, really?

16:52.141 --> 16:56.363
Have you decided my position
on capital-gains tax cuts?

16:56.450 --> 16:58.234
What are my foreign
policy objectives?!

16:58.321 --> 16:59.409
That doesn't matter.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.150
What does matter
is you'll be

17:01.237 --> 17:02.891
the only person
in that position

17:02.978 --> 17:06.112
who will ever give a crap
about people like us.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.636
We've been getting
the short end of the stick

17:08.723 --> 17:11.204
for thousands of years,
and I, for one, am sick of it.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.944
Now, you are going
to be president, mister,

17:13.031 --> 17:14.468
and that's the end of it.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.209
Did it ever occur to you

17:16.296 --> 17:18.559
that I could have taken this
job, gotten really rich

17:18.646 --> 17:20.734
and then bought my way
into being president?

17:20.821 --> 17:22.867
Of course it did.
We decided against it.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.827
-What?!
-Because then you wouldn't
be a good president.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.175
You wouldn't
have suffered enough.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.483
I have been suffering
all my life.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.789
I'm sorry.
It's not enough.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.008
You know what
it's like

17:33.095 --> 17:34.314
to be poor,
and you know

17:34.401 --> 17:35.576
what it's like
to work hard.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.143
Now you're going
to learn what it's like

17:37.230 --> 17:38.796
to sweep floors
and bust your ass

17:38.883 --> 17:42.104
and accomplish twice as much
as all the kids around you.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.453
And it won't mean anything

17:43.540 --> 17:45.412
because they will still
look down on you.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.545
And you will want so much
for them to like you,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.504
and they just won't.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.114
And it'll break your heart,

17:52.201 --> 17:54.029
and that'll make your heart
bigger and open your eyes

17:54.116 --> 17:55.900
and finally you will realize

17:55.987 --> 17:57.641
that there's more
to life than proving

17:57.728 --> 17:59.382
you're the smartest
person in the world.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.170
I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you
don't get the easy path.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.823
You don't get to just have fun

18:05.910 --> 18:07.651
and be rich and live
the life of luxury.

18:07.738 --> 18:08.609
That's Dewey.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.828
Really?

18:10.915 --> 18:12.439
This is unbelievable.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.876
You actually expect
me to be president.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.705
No, no, I'm sorry.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.924
You expect me to be one
of the greatest presidents

18:20.011 --> 18:22.188
in the history of
the United States.

18:22.275 --> 18:26.279
You look me in the eye
and you tell me you can't do it.

18:30.021 --> 18:33.373
And as the Dalai Lama so
eloquently stated last summer

18:33.460 --> 18:37.072
on my yacht,
"Wisdom is the light by day,

18:37.159 --> 18:38.639
virtue is the protection
by night."

18:38.726 --> 18:40.945
And as we go down
the path of life,

18:41.032 --> 18:44.645
there's often confusion and fear
because we fail to remember

18:44.732 --> 18:47.430
that we have
this wisdom within us.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.432
It's there to call on
to get us through

18:49.519 --> 18:53.610
the dark night of the soul,
to help us achieve...

18:53.697 --> 18:55.482
AmeriSys Industries?
What's that?

18:55.569 --> 18:56.700
Shh!

18:56.787 --> 18:58.833
It's my employee badge.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.835
Please don't tell Mom.
It'd make her too happy.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.141
She'd never let me
live it down.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.316
You got a job?

19:03.403 --> 19:05.622
For the last two months.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.363
It's at this
giant corporation.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.235
I'm in this tiny
little cubicle,

19:09.322 --> 19:11.541
surrounded by hundreds of
other tiny little cubicles,

19:11.628 --> 19:13.848
inputting numbers
into a computer all day.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.241
And I love it.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.025
I love everything
about it.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.897
I love the stability and
the regular paychecks.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.464
I love my parking space.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.379
I love getting those
stupid joke e-mails.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.338
Oh, did you get the one
about the two Irish guys?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.122
That's classic!

19:31.082 --> 19:33.694
And now, with his
valedictory speech,

19:33.781 --> 19:35.043
please welcome Malcolm...

19:35.130 --> 19:35.957
[microphone feedback]

19:45.401 --> 19:47.186
Like all of you,

19:47.273 --> 19:50.101
I'm praying for this speech
to be over soon.

19:55.194 --> 19:59.372
Most of us have been dreaming
of this day for years,

19:59.459 --> 20:02.070
the day we leave childhood
and achieve independence.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.857
But even if we move
thousands of miles away,

20:06.944 --> 20:09.382
there's no escape.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.427
Our families are
coming with us.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.647
They'll be with us forever--

20:13.734 --> 20:17.390
in our habits, our gestures,

20:17.477 --> 20:22.003
and in the choices we make,
so we'll never be set free.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.962
But we'll never be alone.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.794
As Paul McCartney once said...

20:35.451 --> 20:37.845
LOIS: Oh, my God!

20:37.932 --> 20:39.760
What kind of a monster would
do something like this?

20:39.847 --> 20:41.588
Oh, Hal, for God's sake,
don't touch it!

20:41.675 --> 20:42.850
Man, if Mom
ever found out

20:42.937 --> 20:45.069
it was the two of us...

20:45.156 --> 20:46.245
Hey.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.988
The five-settings heating pad!

20:51.075 --> 20:53.339
You listen to me.
You really do!

20:53.426 --> 20:54.557
[oven timer dings]

20:54.644 --> 20:57.691
Someone's cake is ready.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.215
Mom, you can yell and scream
all you want.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.825
It's not going to change me!

21:01.912 --> 21:04.698
I will look for a job when
I am damn good and ready!

21:04.785 --> 21:06.526
You just can't stand
that your son

21:06.613 --> 21:08.179
is still a free spirit!

21:10.007 --> 21:11.095
Chicken casserole
for dinner?

21:11.182 --> 21:13.272
Mmm. Home at 5:00.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.363
This is so nice.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.973
Reese is gone.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.714
Malcolm's off to Harvard.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.629
I don't know how you
did it, but everything

21:22.716 --> 21:25.284
worked out exactly as planned.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.459
What's wrong?

21:29.157 --> 21:33.117
[shrieking]

21:33.204 --> 21:35.119
And when they found the
peepholes in the bathroom

21:35.206 --> 21:37.165
they fired Al
and brought me on full time.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.036
Grandma's right:
it's good to have a patsy.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.952
So how's it going with you,
Mr. Ivy League Big Shot?

21:42.039 --> 21:43.911
It's great.
It's a whole new world.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.695
Listen, I've got to get
to my Calc class.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.306
I'll talk to you later.
