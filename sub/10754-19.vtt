00:09.492 --> 00:13.704
Brian, let me assure you,
no one is a born scatterbrain.

00:13.871 --> 00:16.415
Just develop
your powers of concentration.

00:16.582 --> 00:21.504
On a trip to the Amazon I observed
the hunters of the Shipibo tribe.

00:22.421 --> 00:27.385
With only a crude blowgun they bring
down monkeys from the forest canopy.

00:27.551 --> 00:30.971
How? Focus and mental discipline.

00:31.138 --> 00:36.936
We must work on that. Focus
on one thing and not get distracted...

00:37.103 --> 00:40.314
We've been nominated for a SeaBea!

00:41.357 --> 00:46.278
But not so single-minded that we
can't be spontaneous. We'll be back.

00:46.445 --> 00:49.782
Oh, Roz! This is wonderful!
Two years in a row!

00:49.949 --> 00:52.826
They like me! They really like me!

00:52.993 --> 00:56.163
I have to lose
five pounds in two weeks!

00:56.330 --> 01:00.626
That'll be enough of that. Oh, Roz,
I bought this for you this morning.

01:00.793 --> 01:04.337
I was hoping I wouldn't have to say
it was just for being you.

01:04.504 --> 01:06.590
Thanks, Frasier.

01:06.757 --> 01:12.262
This is great! Last year I wanted to
win so much I didn't even enjoy it.

01:12.429 --> 01:14.515
This year, I don't care.

01:14.681 --> 01:18.310
I'll buy a beautiful dress,
have my hair done,

01:18.477 --> 01:21.313
stretch out in the limo with my date...

01:21.480 --> 01:23.774
Why bother having your hair done?

01:23.941 --> 01:26.693
Hey, Doc! Congratulations!

01:26.860 --> 01:29.071
Hey, Roz! Oh, OK.

01:30.989 --> 01:35.702
Congratulations to you, too.
Four nominations, three wins.

01:35.869 --> 01:40.374
I've been a symbol of broadcasting
excellence in Seattle since 1991.

01:41.708 --> 01:43.752
(Bulldog barks)

01:47.214 --> 01:49.216
See ya, Doc.

01:49.383 --> 01:51.927
- 30 seconds.
- Whom do we have?

01:52.094 --> 01:57.140
Line one is a Bainbridge shoplifter.
Line two is your "No.1 fan."

01:57.307 --> 02:00.060
- Kari?
- Fourth time this week.

02:00.227 --> 02:03.313
All she does is gush
and say you're wonderful.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.107
And this hurts me how?

02:08.818 --> 02:14.658
Hello, Seattle. Time for one call.
So, Roz, who do we have on the line?

02:14.824 --> 02:16.910
Oh, please.

02:18.453 --> 02:22.874
- Hello. You're on with Frasier Crane.
- (Kari) 'Hi, Dr Crane. It's me, Kari.

02:23.041 --> 02:28.463
'Nervous as usual. I hope you're not
sick of me. I think you're wonderful.

02:28.630 --> 02:30.673
'Thank you for talking to me.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.969
- Thank you for being so sweet.
- 'Thank you for giving good advice.'

02:35.136 --> 02:37.722
Thank you for...

02:37.889 --> 02:40.391
Sorry. lf that's all...

02:40.558 --> 02:44.395
- 'That was a beautiful rose you bought.'
- I bought it for...

02:45.855 --> 02:49.609
- Excuse me?
- 'Don't be surprised. I saw you.

02:49.776 --> 02:53.071
- 'Not your regular routine.'
- My regular routine?

02:53.237 --> 02:58.659
'Café Nervosa. You go every morning.
Except today. I'm boring you. Bye.'

02:58.826 --> 03:01.329
Goodbye, Kari.

03:02.830 --> 03:07.085
That's all for today, Seattle.
Goodbye and good listening.

03:08.836 --> 03:11.297
That was weird. She's following you?

03:11.464 --> 03:13.925
She's hardly following me.

03:14.091 --> 03:17.929
She may go to Café Nervosa.
The florist is next door.

03:18.095 --> 03:21.933
Be careful out there.
There's a lot of creeps.

03:22.099 --> 03:26.479
I've met lots of odd people and
I've never called any of them a creep.

03:26.646 --> 03:30.775
Stop wearing corduroys.
I can't see your panty line.

03:30.983 --> 03:35.863
Although, some people do send me
groping for synonyms.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.789 --> 03:48.751
- What are you up to?
- Measuring your father for his tuxedo.

03:48.918 --> 03:53.339
That reminds me.
Maris can't make your awards.

03:53.506 --> 03:55.925
Colour me surprised. Any reason?

03:56.967 --> 03:58.802
Yes.

03:58.969 --> 04:02.556
It's a good one.
She's upset about her manicurist.

04:04.391 --> 04:08.604
She's done Maris's nails for years
and she's been taken critically ill.

04:08.771 --> 04:10.939
How bad is she?

04:11.106 --> 04:14.777
She'll be fine
when she finds another manicurist.

04:14.943 --> 04:18.447
For now she's curtailed
all public appearances.

04:18.613 --> 04:21.742
I'm sorry. It's not like
I'm nominated every year.

04:21.909 --> 04:24.077
Oh, wait a minute. Yes, it is!

04:26.038 --> 04:30.459
As someone once said, "Popularity
is the hallmark of mediocrity."

04:30.626 --> 04:33.712
- You just made that up.
- Yes, but I stand by it.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.382
Are you joining us for dinner, Dr Crane?

04:37.549 --> 04:39.635
No. We're going to the opera.

04:39.801 --> 04:43.764
- We're seeing...
- "Der Fliegende Holländer".

04:43.930 --> 04:47.100
Don't forget the tickets
are in your briefcase.

04:47.267 --> 04:49.895
I can hear that first aria.

04:50.687 --> 04:55.942
Don't, Niles. You'll sing it, then I will,
and I won't get it out of my head!

04:57.486 --> 04:59.488
What's this?

04:59.654 --> 05:03.658
"Dear Dr Crane. A little bit of me
to wrap around your neck.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.286
"Your No.1 fan, Kari."

05:06.453 --> 05:09.414
How sweet.
Your fan knitted you a scarf.

05:09.581 --> 05:13.877
My case was with me all day,
expect at the barber's.

05:14.044 --> 05:17.631
That didn't give her
more than 30 seconds.

05:22.177 --> 05:25.680
She followed you
then slipped a scarf into your case?

05:25.847 --> 05:30.018
- She's a devoted fan.
- With the handwriting of a sociopath.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.438
Big loops.

05:33.605 --> 05:36.775
That's how they caught
the "Butcher of Brighton".

05:36.941 --> 05:39.402
He used big loops. A sign of anger.

05:39.569 --> 05:43.323
He crossed his T's downwards,
indicating aggression.

05:43.490 --> 05:48.411
He also kept a Demitasse saucer
full of eyelids on his night table.

05:51.372 --> 05:54.542
Should we put a two-way lock
on her door?

05:57.795 --> 06:01.215
There are weirdos around,
so keep your eyes open.

06:01.382 --> 06:04.177
She's not weird.
She just finds me fascinating.

06:04.344 --> 06:06.387
The distinction would be?

06:08.723 --> 06:11.893
Her invading my space is inappropriate

06:12.059 --> 06:15.480
but I hardly think
we should barricade the door.

06:15.646 --> 06:20.443
First phone calls, then spying,
then she was in your briefcase.

06:20.610 --> 06:25.740
The predator is stalking its prey
in ever narrowing circles or "loops".

06:25.907 --> 06:28.284
- That's for you, Daphne.
- Thank you.

06:28.451 --> 06:29.869
(Doorbell)

06:30.036 --> 06:33.956
You make me sound like a goat being
staked out. No one's hunting me down.

06:34.123 --> 06:37.043
No one is closing in on me.

06:38.169 --> 06:41.172
Look! These must be from the station!

06:43.257 --> 06:45.509
"From your No.1 fan, Kari.

06:46.594 --> 06:50.389
"Your time has come.
You're going to get what you deserve."

06:50.556 --> 06:53.142
The loop tightens.

06:53.309 --> 06:57.438
Stop it, Niles!
She means it's time I won this award.

06:57.605 --> 07:00.774
You will not turn me
into a nervous wreck.

07:00.941 --> 07:02.651
(Balloon bursts)

07:05.863 --> 07:08.532
It's just not going to happen!

07:12.995 --> 07:16.123
(Man) 'I don't understand it.
I'm a successful guy.

07:16.290 --> 07:20.169
'I have my own car dealership,
but I'm depressed.

07:20.335 --> 07:23.047
'You may have heard of me -
Madman Martinez.'

07:23.213 --> 07:26.049
What's the source of your depression,
Madman?

07:26.216 --> 07:30.179
'I guess it's just that business is down.
I don't know why.

07:30.345 --> 07:32.806
'I slashed prices this week.

07:32.973 --> 07:35.350
'I've an '88 Olds Cutlass on the lot

07:35.517 --> 07:40.272
'in rare turquoise metallic,
cordova roof, leather...

07:40.439 --> 07:46.236
'And there's six brand-new Supras,
with a 20% discount to listeners.

07:46.403 --> 07:49.823
'People say, "You're crazy!"
I say, "l deal in volume!"'

07:49.990 --> 07:52.200
Fortunately, so do I.

07:52.367 --> 07:54.494
Our time's up, folks.

07:54.661 --> 08:01.251
Stay tuned for Bob Bulldog Briscoe
after these paid commercial messages.

08:03.378 --> 08:06.631
Roz, you're supposed
to screen the calls.

08:06.798 --> 08:09.801
Just douse me in gasoline
and toss me a match.

08:09.968 --> 08:12.470
I hoped a stern warning would do.

08:12.637 --> 08:14.973
I'm talking about this.

08:16.266 --> 08:21.062
Three hours till a limo picks me up
and my nose erupts like Krakatoa!

08:22.480 --> 08:27.861
- It's barely noticeable.
- From where? The space shuttle?

08:29.112 --> 08:31.156
Vintage Roz, or what?

08:31.323 --> 08:36.244
I finally lose five pounds
and I gain three of it back on my nose!

08:36.410 --> 08:40.623
I'm sure that with enough foundation
and some contouring,

08:40.789 --> 08:43.251
maybe a little shadowing.

08:43.418 --> 08:47.338
Have you considered wearing
a beekeeper's mask?

08:49.007 --> 08:52.468
Do I make fun of that astrodome
you call a forehead?

08:56.973 --> 09:00.268
It's been a tough week for me, too.

09:00.435 --> 09:05.106
Kari's put notes in my briefcase.
She's even been to my apartment.

09:05.273 --> 09:09.110
You have to do something.
Remember Leo the Happy Chef?

09:09.277 --> 09:14.782
He had an obsessed fan, too. It started
innocently, then she got into his house.

09:14.949 --> 09:18.202
She bent his whisk
and scratched his Teflon!

09:19.412 --> 09:21.581
She made his life miserable.

09:21.747 --> 09:25.626
She didn't quit until he hired
a bodyguard. Should I find out who?

09:25.793 --> 09:28.671
No. I can't believe Kari
poses a real threat.

09:28.838 --> 09:33.426
She hasn't even looked at me
face-to-face. She's had the chance.

09:33.593 --> 09:37.930
Suit yourself. But if you ask me,
she's acting very weird.

09:39.015 --> 09:44.520
- Tea good for your nose?
- No, I found a bag to match my shoes(!)

09:45.896 --> 09:49.358
You're dripping all over the console.

09:49.525 --> 09:51.694
Oh, my goodness.

09:51.861 --> 09:54.947
- Kari.
- How did she get in your jacket?

09:55.114 --> 09:58.451
I have no idea.
"I'm disappointed in you, Dr Crane.

09:58.617 --> 10:01.328
"You didn't wear my scarf.

10:01.495 --> 10:05.457
"The last man
who disappointed me that way...

10:05.624 --> 10:07.668
"is in his grave."

10:08.794 --> 10:14.592
"I'll be at the awards and I'll be
looking for you. Your No.1 fan, Kari."

10:14.758 --> 10:20.055
Great! And I'm sitting at your table
with a bull's-eye on my nose.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.815
Dr Crane, you've got to try to relax.

10:29.982 --> 10:32.776
Yes. What do I have
to be nervous about?

10:32.943 --> 10:35.696
lf I lose this award, I'll be devastated.

10:35.863 --> 10:41.201
lf I win, my mad stalker will have
a clear shot when I accept.

10:41.368 --> 10:44.746
Don't worry.
That's why you hired the bodyguard.

10:44.913 --> 10:49.710
I don't see why. Even if something
does happen, I was a cop for 30 years.

10:49.876 --> 10:51.920
It's a waste of money.

10:52.087 --> 10:57.676
They're skilled bodyguards, trained
to size up a crowd, plan an escape.

10:57.843 --> 11:00.762
- Even get shot.
- I know how to take a bullet.

11:00.929 --> 11:05.142
That's just what your personality needs -
another bullet.

11:06.977 --> 11:08.437
(Doorbell)

11:08.603 --> 11:11.273
That must be him. Who is it?

11:11.440 --> 11:15.068
Lizzie Borden.
Could you autograph my hatchet?

11:18.822 --> 11:21.032
That's not very funny.

11:21.199 --> 11:25.203
- Everyone ready to go?
- We're waiting for his rent-a-goon.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.539
He's stuck in traffic.

11:27.706 --> 11:31.334
Or your admirer got to him first
and he's stuffed in a closet

11:31.501 --> 11:35.839
with a bloated tongue and
garrotted neck. Is that champagne?

11:38.383 --> 11:40.719
You're a fountain of comfort!

11:40.885 --> 11:45.765
I'm just teasing. I'm a little jealous.
I told Maris about your troubles.

11:45.932 --> 11:48.768
All she does is sulk
and talk about bodyguards.

11:48.935 --> 11:51.896
"Aren't we important enough
to be stalked?"

11:53.982 --> 11:56.234
I don't know what to say to her.

11:56.401 --> 11:59.529
Tell her to go on being herself.
Her day will come.

12:00.572 --> 12:02.824
(Doorbell)

12:02.991 --> 12:05.118
That must be my muscle.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.581
It's a woman!
Where's my bodyguard now?

12:10.748 --> 12:14.669
It's Cindy Carruthers
from the Unified Protection Agency.

12:14.836 --> 12:17.547
Your bodyguard's named "Cindy"?

12:17.714 --> 12:20.174
Were they all out of "Tiffanys"?

12:21.718 --> 12:27.223
I was expecting someone big and wide.
A Dominic, a Rocco, a Ruth, even.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.769
Hello. I'm so glad to see you.

12:31.936 --> 12:35.356
Thank you, Dr Crane.
But you made a fatal mistake.

12:35.523 --> 12:37.567
Oh, my God! It is Kari!

12:37.733 --> 12:41.946
You should have called for
a description before you let me in.

12:42.113 --> 12:44.657
Hi, Tina. Bring the car around.

12:44.824 --> 12:48.911
- Tina?
- I guess Candy was busy.

12:49.912 --> 12:52.540
First rule:
"Trust no one you don't know."

12:52.707 --> 12:55.000
Let me write that down!

12:55.167 --> 12:59.004
You're right.
I just feel silly when I act paranoid.

12:59.171 --> 13:02.508
- Don't. Paranoid is good.
- I was paranoid.

13:05.344 --> 13:07.388
Who are these people?

13:08.305 --> 13:10.766
My brother, Dr Niles Crane,
my father, Martin,

13:10.933 --> 13:13.853
and his care specialist, Daphne Moon.

13:14.019 --> 13:17.648
You've seen a bit of mayhem
in your day, haven't you?

13:17.815 --> 13:21.986
- Excuse me?
- I sense these things. I'm psychic.

13:22.152 --> 13:24.154
Wait, I'm getting a flash now.

13:24.321 --> 13:29.243
Did your grandfather
have a steel plate in his head?

13:30.202 --> 13:34.581
This lunatic who's been calling you.
Any particular accent?

13:34.748 --> 13:36.583
No.

13:36.750 --> 13:42.214
- You have a security system?
- We don't need one. We've got Eddie.

13:42.381 --> 13:44.466
Hello, Eddie.

13:48.720 --> 13:53.934
Don't be fooled. Touch me and
you'd get a ball-sized bite in your butt.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.353
And Eddie would go for your ankles.

13:59.481 --> 14:01.984
Look at the time. Shouldn't we go?

14:02.150 --> 14:06.196
I'll secure the elevator.
Don't open the door for anyone.

14:06.363 --> 14:10.575
I need your blood type,
where the nearest trauma centre is,

14:10.742 --> 14:14.037
and which family members
would donate organs.

14:15.956 --> 14:19.793
Just so you know,
I have unusually small kidneys.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.671
(Phone rings)

14:22.838 --> 14:25.715
Hello. Crane residence.

14:25.882 --> 14:28.677
- I think it's her.
- Niles, call Cindy.

14:28.843 --> 14:31.137
Put her on speaker.

14:33.974 --> 14:39.437
(Kari) 'I know you're rushed, but I wanted
to say I'll be wearing a red dress.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.484
'But don't worry about finding me.
I'll find you.

14:46.069 --> 14:49.030
- 'Bye!'
- Kari, wait!

14:51.825 --> 14:54.869
Don't let it bother you so.
Come on. Let's go.

14:55.036 --> 15:01.417
I find it hard to imagine a woman with
such a sweet voice being dangerous.

15:01.584 --> 15:05.380
Does the name "Squeaky" Fromme
mean anything to you?

15:13.638 --> 15:17.642
There's a lot of red dresses
so let's go over some rules.

15:17.809 --> 15:21.396
Don't go anywhere alone.
Go to the men's room with a buddy.

15:21.562 --> 15:23.773
Always keep your back to the wall.

15:23.940 --> 15:27.235
That'll take some marksmanship.

15:27.402 --> 15:30.863
I think I see her.
Red dress, standing by the bar.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.283
She's staring at all the men
but hiding her face.

15:36.911 --> 15:41.332
That is my producer. She's harmless.
She has a pimple on her nose.

15:41.499 --> 15:44.001
Looks like a biblical plague.

15:44.168 --> 15:46.671
Roz, over here.
Give me that.

15:46.837 --> 15:49.840
You look beautiful. Come join us.

15:50.007 --> 15:53.135
- Hi. I'm Cindy Carruthers.
- Hi.

15:53.302 --> 15:55.638
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Roz.

15:55.805 --> 15:57.848
Just stop that.

15:58.015 --> 16:02.895
You look terrific. You've done
a great job. It's almost disappeared.

16:04.230 --> 16:08.359
Whoa, Roz!
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

16:11.654 --> 16:15.282
- And who's this lovely lady?
- Cindy Carruthers.

16:15.449 --> 16:18.953
- She has a concealed weapon.
- Makes two of us.

16:19.954 --> 16:22.498
No kidding. She's his bodyguard.

16:22.665 --> 16:26.043
Wanna check out
a body worth guarding?

16:28.295 --> 16:30.631
lf I move my thumb I could kill you.

16:30.798 --> 16:33.342
I've never been so turned on.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.470
OK, let me go.

16:37.346 --> 16:39.848
So can I call you?

16:43.143 --> 16:48.357
I wish she'd just make her move.
I hate thinking it could be anyone.

16:48.524 --> 16:50.567
You know she's wearing a red dress.

16:50.734 --> 16:53.153
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

16:53.320 --> 16:55.989
I'm no professional bodyguard,

16:56.156 --> 17:02.246
but if I was looking to whack a guy,
maybe I'd lie about what I was wearing.

17:02.412 --> 17:06.540
No offence to your father
but stick to looking for a red dress.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.252
Here we are, good as new.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.840
Should we all head up to the ballroom?

17:15.008 --> 17:17.051
Help me.

17:18.929 --> 17:21.306
Niles, just hear me out on this.

17:21.473 --> 17:27.354
Was it strange that Cindy dismissed
Dad's theory? She's not wearing red.

17:27.521 --> 17:31.608
You can't think she's the...
She couldn't... But how could...?

17:32.943 --> 17:38.240
Think about it. She was out of the
apartment when the stalker phoned.

17:38.406 --> 17:42.619
So she was. And we know
she has a cellular phone!

17:42.786 --> 17:45.288
But why hasn't she made her move?

17:45.455 --> 17:47.791
Maybe she wants to get you alone.

17:49.417 --> 17:53.088
Too many red dresses.
We'll take our own elevator.

17:59.886 --> 18:01.930
Don't be nervous.

18:02.096 --> 18:05.683
I'm not nervous.
Just a little chilly. It's cold.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.269
You should have worn a scarf.

18:09.812 --> 18:13.024
Yes, I should have. I meant to. Honest.

18:14.025 --> 18:16.402
Where's that elevator?

18:16.569 --> 18:19.572
I asked for this assignment.

18:19.739 --> 18:25.244
The truth is, I'm a fan of yours.
But I guess you figured that out.

18:25.411 --> 18:27.455
- Oh, my God!
- What?

18:27.622 --> 18:30.416
There! There, behind the bar!

18:37.131 --> 18:41.594
Frasier Crane? I've waited
for this moment for a long time.

18:41.761 --> 18:44.472
I'm your No.1 fan.

18:46.974 --> 18:50.061
- Roz! Find Cindy!
- Help me. Get him off me.

18:50.228 --> 18:53.981
It's Mrs Littlejohn,
head of the nomination committee!

18:54.148 --> 18:58.694
This is a small world.
I know your brother, Aubrey.

18:58.861 --> 19:01.614
For God's sake, help the lady up.

19:01.781 --> 19:06.619
I'm so sorry. I've been stalked
by this woman named Kari.

19:06.786 --> 19:10.790
- When you said you'd been waiting...
- To get an autograph!

19:10.956 --> 19:14.668
- Who's got a pen?
- Thank you, no.

19:14.835 --> 19:19.048
Let's hope we win because
we won't get nominated next year.

19:19.215 --> 19:22.426
Have you changed your hairstyle?

19:22.593 --> 19:25.971
What happened?
Why did you run away from me?

19:26.138 --> 19:28.724
Paranoia has sent me crazy!

19:28.891 --> 19:33.103
First I thought you were the stalker,
then I thought she was.

19:33.270 --> 19:37.691
I'm going to confront this!
Everyone, I will be in the lobby.

19:37.858 --> 19:41.695
- Just calm down.
- Dad, please. I will be in the lobby!

19:50.621 --> 19:53.373
You're Kari, aren't you?

19:53.540 --> 19:56.084
How did you know?

19:56.251 --> 20:00.172
You made a scarf like that for Frasier.
He's my son.

20:00.339 --> 20:04.384
There's been a big misunderstanding.
I'm just a fan.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.595
I never meant to frighten him.

20:06.762 --> 20:11.141
What about that note about
that guy ending up in his grave?

20:11.308 --> 20:15.729
That meant my husband, Walter.
He caught pneumonia.

20:15.896 --> 20:20.150
I won't bother your son any more.
Could you tell him what happened?

20:20.317 --> 20:27.074
Yes. lf I'm lucky, he won't understand
and I'll have to explain again.

20:27.240 --> 20:31.578
He'll understand. That's the one thing
about your son, Mr Crane.

20:31.745 --> 20:35.081
He's so smart and level-headed.

20:35.248 --> 20:38.543
What's she been smoking?

20:43.298 --> 20:46.468
I'm here, you demented harpy!

20:49.596 --> 20:51.640
Come and get me!

20:52.474 --> 20:54.309
Kari?

20:56.936 --> 20:58.772
Kari!

21:09.199 --> 21:12.327
I know you're here, so come on out.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.375
Not so brave any more, huh?

21:19.542 --> 21:23.379
You think you're tough
but you have to hide in the shadows.

21:24.964 --> 21:28.217
Want to see who's really tough?
Just come on out.

21:39.187 --> 21:45.818
When I said "tough", I was speaking
clearly in a rhetorical sense.

21:47.195 --> 21:50.573
Would...any of you
happen to have the time?

21:53.159 --> 21:56.704
Would...any of you...

21:56.871 --> 21:58.915
like the time?

22:02.710 --> 22:05.504
(# Theme tune plays)

22:05.671 --> 22:10.468
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.634 --> 22:12.261
# Mercy!

22:12.428 --> 22:19.435
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:19.602 --> 22:26.066
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.233 --> 22:29.236
# They're calling again #

22:29.403 --> 22:31.822
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:31.989 --> 22:35.910
# What is a boy to do? #

22:36.076 --> 22:39.371
Good night!
