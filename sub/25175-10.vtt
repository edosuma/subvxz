I’m handling it; Joe.

00:10.430 --> 00:12.250
[Joe]
They’ll wait unt/l
the last day of the Haj];

00:12.360 --> 00:14.169
so they won ’t be symptomatic
unt/l they get home.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.498
Spread the epidemic
as far as poss/b/e.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.170
[Bob] It was
an ingenious plan, really.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.009
It looks like
a terrorist attack

00:20.120 --> 00:21.860
backfired. It's a holocaust.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.188
It's them, now, or us, later.

Were you really
going to l(/ll her?
[Sharla]
I don ’t know.

00:26.850 --> 00:29.626
If we're going to do this,
we're gonna do it by the book.

[Joe] Why didn't you kill me?
[Joubert] The contract on
your life was canceled.

00:38.340 --> 00:40.069
[Sharla] Who the fuck is that?
[Marty] Be careful.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.351
The car will slow beside you.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.042
And someone you know,
maybe even trust, will get out.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.664
That's not possible.
Everyone I trust, is dead.

11:37.670 --> 11:39.763
-Airport.
-Where are you going?

11:39.870 --> 11:42.054
To make the people I work for
pay for their sins.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.151
All right, sounds good to me.

Bob, are you here?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.431
[Joe] You used to come here
with my uncle.

12:33.890 --> 12:34.822
You're Joe Turner.

12:34.930 --> 12:36.704
I used to come here, too.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.801
As a kid.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.326
It scared me
how isolated it is.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.451
How did I get here?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.839
You know, I got lost
in those woods, once.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.760

12:52.870 --> 12:54.679
I screamed for an hour.
Nobody came.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.007
Of course,
no one could hear me.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.101
[Marty] Did you kidnap me?

13:01.070 --> 13:03.072
How's your arm?

13:04.160 --> 13:06.151
It hurts.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.492
Why did you bring me here?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.534
You lost a lot of blood.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.187
You need to eat.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.587
Doctor's orders.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.339
Joe, you're making a mistake.

13:16.450 --> 13:18.020
I've got a protein bar.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.939
-I'm on your side.
-A trail mix.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.803
Just talk to me.
I... I'm not your enemy.

13:26.260 --> 13:27.989
Have a seat.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.091
We'll talk.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.964
You can get into
a lot of trouble for kidnapping

13:42.070 --> 13:45.813
-a federal officer. I don't
want to see that happen to you.
-Kidnapping?

13:45.920 --> 13:49.378
You know I've already killed
a federal officer as well as
11 of my colleagues,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.539
my best friend, and Kathy Hale.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.255
No.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.646
I don't believe that you did
any of those things.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.423
But this, you are doing.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.521
Yeah.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.081
Yeah.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.035
What is your connection
to all of this?

14:07.140 --> 14:09.995
-I run the task force that's
been looking for you--
-I've heard that on the radio,

14:10.100 --> 14:12.409
I'm asking what
your involvement is
with the other thing?

14:13.340 --> 14:15.342
What other thing?

14:16.550 --> 14:18.541
You know what I'm sick of,
more than anything?

14:20.230 --> 14:22.221
[shouting] The fucking lie!

14:22.750 --> 14:24.138
You're scaring me.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.231
[gasps] Fuck me!

14:27.720 --> 14:29.711
[gasping]

14:30.520 --> 14:32.511
Uh...

14:33.360 --> 14:35.999
You know,
when you were sleeping,

14:37.370 --> 14:38.701
I was watching you.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.779
And I asked myself,

14:41.890 --> 14:44.393
what I'd be willing to do
to extract information
from you.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.276
-I don't know, anything, Joe.
I don't--
-I asked myself whether

14:47.380 --> 14:49.871
I'd be willing to pour salt
in the wound.

14:49.980 --> 14:52.676
-Joe--
-I, I checked the kitchen,
it has a lot of salt.

14:52.780 --> 14:55.988
You know what, it might
actually be easier to shoot you
in the fucking knee.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.760
Okay.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.600
All right, why don't you just
tell me what you think
that I have done,

15:01.710 --> 15:05.089
and why you think I've done it,
okay? Let's, let's start there.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.739
I think you were complicit
in a plot to release a plague
virus at the Hajj.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.910
I don't know about any
operation at the Hajj.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.201
Did you kill Sharla Shepard?

15:18.210 --> 15:20.189
No, I was helping her.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.281
We were helping each other.

15:23.170 --> 15:24.956
Then who did kill her?

15:25.060 --> 15:30.396
Her name is Gabrielle Joubert.
She does freelance wet work
for the agency.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.195
And you saw this
with your own eyes?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.154
Yes, I did.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.682
Where?

15:35.790 --> 15:37.883
It was at a...

15:37.990 --> 15:44.202
An abandoned warehouse
in Anacostia that Caleb Wolfe
was usmg as a safehouse.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.312
That's where Joubert shot me.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.168
We got there and everyone
was already dead.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.931
I saw the tracker that we had
put on Joubert's car and I

15:53.040 --> 15:55.759
knew immediately that it was
an ambush, and I tried
to warn Sharla.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.441
But it was too late.

15:58.810 --> 16:00.584
Joubert came out of nowhere
and shot her.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.306
And I put down cover fire
for myself. I got upstairs

16:03.410 --> 16:05.401
and then she shot me.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.670
You're lying.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.793
-No, I am not--
-No, you see I...

16:09.900 --> 16:11.151
[Joe scoffs]

16:11.260 --> 16:13.114
I was at the safehouse.

16:13.220 --> 16:15.211
You see, I, I got there
before Joubert.

16:15.870 --> 16:17.861
Then I left with her.

16:18.190 --> 16:20.363
After everyone else was dead.

16:20.470 --> 16:23.769
And there was no sign
of you, or Sharla Shepard.

16:23.870 --> 16:24.962
Because we weren't there, yet.

16:25.070 --> 16:26.412
And then Joubert told me that

16:26.520 --> 16:29.978
you killed Sharla Shepard,

16:30.080 --> 16:33.129
right before I drove her car
of a fucking overpass.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.266
How can you be so sure?
Did Joubert die?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.258
-Did you kill her?
-No. But I did leave her

16:38.370 --> 16:40.099
unconscious in a wrecked car.

16:40.210 --> 16:42.269
Do not underestimate
that woman.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.679
You are being manipulated, Joe.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.031
No, I...

16:47.140 --> 16:48.994
-I'm not being--
-Ask yourself one question.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.909
Why are you still alive?

16:51.020 --> 16:54.148
Do you really think you've
been evading
these trained killers?

16:54.260 --> 16:56.239
-You got a better explanation?
-You've been protected

16:56.340 --> 16:58.160
all the way back to IEP.

16:58.270 --> 17:01.205
The person who is pulling
the strings has a weakness
for you

17:01.310 --> 17:03.039
and he always has.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.368
Are you trying to convince me
that Bob was involved in this?

17:05.470 --> 17:08.997
[chuckles] Who else has
the kind of power
to keep you alive?

17:10.400 --> 17:15.019
But, Joe, I know Joubert's work
and she never misses.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.920
And you and I,
both know your Uncle Bob.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.761
He's always got an agenda.

17:23.490 --> 17:25.219
You're pretty good.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.639
Stick to the story,
no matter what.

17:27.740 --> 17:31.699
Build up an alternate
explanation rooted in
your enemy's own weakness.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.152
Convince him
that he's the crazy one.

17:35.260 --> 17:38.400
So I guess that brings us
back to what I'd be willing
to do to extract information

17:38.510 --> 17:39.602
from you.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.007
Right.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.281
[Joe sighs]

17:42.390 --> 17:45.166
Joe, don't do this.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.272
It's not what you want
to do, I know you.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.649
Please.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.751
[Joe quivers]

17:53.280 --> 17:55.271
Please.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.802
[Joe grunts]

17:59.010 --> 18:01.001
Ahh!

18:02.930 --> 18:04.921

Ah, my fucking leg.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.043

19:02.150 --> 19:03.720
[groans] Ah, my fucking leg.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.969
[panﬁng]

19:06.070 --> 19:07.287
Tell me everything.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.618
I don't know anything.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.177
You tell me everything,
or I shoot you right now.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.975
-I don't know anything.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.722

19:19.290 --> 19:20.826
I don't know.

19:20.930 --> 19:22.943
-[ye||s]
-Next one goes
in the fucking arm.

19:23.050 --> 19:25.041
Okay, stop, stop!

19:25.490 --> 19:27.481

19:29.060 --> 19:30.550

Talk.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.646
[breathing heavily]

19:40.750 --> 19:44.504
You know knowing isn't going
to give you the power
to stop anything.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.672
[phone vibrating]

19:56.760 --> 19:58.136
Yeah.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.980
Bob, it’s Cam Burnbob
from the
Washington Post.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.785
Oh, good morning, Cam.

20:01.890 --> 20:05.348
[continued conversation]

20:05.450 --> 20:07.441
I gotta call you back, Cam.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.355
[phone beeps]

20:10.460 --> 20:12.530
-[footsteps approaching]
-[door opens]

20:32.520 --> 20:35.114
You're safe now, Joe.
You're gonna be okay.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.271
-You're safe now.
-[Joe whimpers]

20:43.450 --> 20:45.441
[Joe sighs]

20:46.490 --> 20:48.060
You're safe.

20:48.170 --> 20:50.172
[Joe exhales]

20:50.900 --> 20:53.039
-Is Aunt Lily home?
-No.

20:53.140 --> 20:54.869
She's at her sister's.

20:54.980 --> 20:57.130
-You knew I'd come.
-I hoped you would.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.662
I didn't know where else to go.

21:02.510 --> 21:04.125
All my friends are dead.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.084
I'm still here.

21:06.190 --> 21:08.408
Janice, Caleb.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.512
She came in,

21:10.920 --> 21:12.911
and she killed everybody.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.291
I didn't even think
to stop her.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.413
What could you do?

21:18.520 --> 21:22.126
She said that the contract
on my life had been canceled.

21:22.930 --> 21:24.921
Was that you?

21:25.730 --> 21:27.721
Yes.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.492
-Are you with them?
-No.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.395
You didn't know about this
the whole time?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.388
I found out yesterday,
the same as you.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.070
-You didn't do anything
to stop them.
-I couldn't.

21:37.180 --> 21:38.477
-I couldn't--
-You made a deal.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.923
I'm just as much a pawn
in this as you are.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.021
[cell phone vibrates]

21:46.750 --> 21:48.741
I need to get that.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.791
[cell phone vibrating]

22:00.560 --> 22:03.540
-How did she find us?
-[ Cam]
Bob, I need to talk to
you about this dossier--

22:03.650 --> 22:05.641
I gotta call you back, Cam.

22:06.970 --> 22:09.939
Did you give her my phone
so she could track me?

22:10.050 --> 22:12.052
So she could kill my friends.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.215
I didn't have any other way
to protect you.

22:21.670 --> 22:24.025
You... you were protecting
the agency.

22:26.590 --> 22:29.639
You were trying to stop
what they were doing
from getting out.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.752
Even if it meant,
millions of people dying.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.991
There was no saving
those people.

22:37.880 --> 22:41.236
I was just trying to salvage
what I could.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.081
For the country.

22:48.290 --> 22:49.348
And for you.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.145
How were you so sure
you can stop them?

22:51.250 --> 22:53.969
Huh? Did you try?
Did you even fucking try?

22:58.660 --> 23:00.651
[cell phone vibrates]

23:01.700 --> 23:03.986
Did you know Marty Frost
had an insurance policy?

23:11.470 --> 23:13.574
Yeah.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.671
-[Joe] That's um...
-[Marty crying]

23:16.520 --> 23:20.251
That's what stopped them
from killing her,
when she found them out.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.362
What are you
talking about, Joe?

23:23.290 --> 23:25.827
[panﬁng]

23:25.930 --> 23:29.149
[crying] You gotta give me
a second here. You just blew
out my eardrums. I can't think.

23:29.250 --> 23:32.629
I don't want you to think.
I want you to tell me
what the fuck happened.

23:32.740 --> 23:35.072
[grunts and sniffles]

23:35.180 --> 23:37.296
Oh.
[panﬁng]

23:38.260 --> 23:40.490
[both panting]

23:43.150 --> 23:45.141
It started in the desert.

23:46.030 --> 23:47.759
[Joe] When she was
in Saudi Arabia.

23:47.870 --> 23:50.304
Isn ’t that where you sent her,
when you were done with her?

23:52.350 --> 23:55.376
She wanted revenge against you.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.471
Against the agency.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.509
And when she saw Sam and Elden
somewhere they weren ’t
supposed to be...

24:03.570 --> 24:05.925
[indistinct chatter]

24:07.690 --> 24:09.681
Consider me in.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.939
I know that you plan
to release a plague,

24:30.710 --> 24:32.246
at the Hajj.

24:32.350 --> 24:34.352
And make it look
like a boomerang.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.831
I have all the_evidence
necessary to bring It down
on your head.

24:46.370 --> 24:48.361
But I'm not interested in that.

24:51.010 --> 24:52.705
[Joe]
Why didn ’t
they just k/l/ you?

24:52.810 --> 24:55.313
7'hey k/l/ed everyone else
who got in their way.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.911
But somehow you made it clear
to them that killing you

24:58.020 --> 24:59.794
wouldn't make their problem
go away now.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.788
How the fuck
did you manage that?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.902
If anything happened to her,

25:05.910 --> 25:07.684
the whole thing would come out.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.644
[gasping]

25:09.750 --> 25:11.741
[quivering]

25:15.240 --> 25:16.457
[cocks gun]

25:16.560 --> 25:18.551
-You're gonna kill--
-[gunshot]

25:26.450 --> 25:28.441
She was smart.

25:30.770 --> 25:32.761
"She was?"

25:35.020 --> 25:38.751
Aren't you the one that said,
sometimes you have to do
a bad thing now, so you won't

25:38.860 --> 25:40.851
have to do a worse thing later?

25:57.480 --> 25:59.539
If you killed her,
it was for nothing.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.619
Now they have no choice.
Now they have to stop.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.711
There's no stopping it.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.947
These are fanatics.

26:06.050 --> 26:08.041
They don't have red light.

26:08.530 --> 26:10.521
No calling it off.

26:11.450 --> 26:14.635
I was trying
to minimize the bleeding.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.652
What good would it do
for the world to know that
we were the cause of

26:18.900 --> 26:20.891
the deaths of so many people?

26:25.670 --> 26:29.925
Can you imagine the effect
it will have on the millions
of peace-lovmg Muslims

26:30.030 --> 26:32.009
living in this country just

26:32.110 --> 26:34.670
radicalized,
half of them, Joe?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.071
[cell phone vibrating]

26:50.330 --> 26:52.321
[newscaster]
Marty Frost just
turned up dead.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.637
Her lawyer had a dossier
of classiﬁed information

26:58.740 --> 27:00.731
on a dead man ’5 switch.

27:07.310 --> 27:11.644
The files allege the CIA
Is about to release
an aerosol/zed plague virus

27:11.750 --> 27:13.741
at the Haj]:

27:16.440 --> 27:19.216
I know you're hearing me
say nothing at all.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.993
And I don't know anything
about any such operation.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.720
[continues conversation
on phone]

27:33.370 --> 27:35.361
Thanks for the heads-up.

27:43.580 --> 27:46.219
That was the
Washington Post.
They have the story.

27:48.190 --> 27:50.181
[exhales]

27:53.350 --> 27:55.341
They're not going to run it.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.093
What?

27:59.200 --> 28:03.534
They know that if they do,
it will cause a panic
at the Hajj.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.700
And endanger the lives
of everybody there.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.028
Their lives are already
in danger.

28:09.130 --> 28:10.859
They can't just do nothing.

28:10.970 --> 28:13.882
That's exactly what they're
going to do. They're going
to sit on the story.

28:16.370 --> 28:18.372
If there's an outbreak,

28:19.940 --> 28:21.476
because of you,

28:21.580 --> 28:24.731
they'll know that the CIA
is responsible,

28:25.860 --> 28:27.043
and that, they'll publish.

28:27.150 --> 28:29.266
No. They can't just let
all those people die.

28:32.430 --> 28:36.526
Two million people are going
to be infected with
the plague, tomorrow.

28:36.630 --> 28:38.837
We still have a chance
to do something about it.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.725
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Joe sighs]

28:51.570 --> 28:54.744
We are looking for someone
that we_know almost
nothing about.

28:54.850 --> 28:56.738
What we do know is, he's male.

28:56.850 --> 28:58.875
A former American soldier.

28:58.980 --> 29:02.518
Our source said that he had
been tortured by Al-Qaeda
for a couple of years.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.714
Non-Muslims aren't allowed
Into Mecca, which means,
he is a Muslim.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.004
Or at least, passes as one.

29:08.110 --> 29:10.761
However, he may have
converted wh/le in captivity.

29:10.870 --> 29:13.998
Biometric technology
makes it impossible to fly
under a false passport.

29:14.110 --> 29:16.999
Which means, if he flew
to Saudi Arabia,

29:17.110 --> 29:18.816
he did not change his identity

29:18.920 --> 29:20.410
unt/l he got there.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.774
Now, some p/lgnms arrive
in Mecca before
the Hajj starts.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.814
The wealthy stay in hotels.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.981
But once the Hajj starts,
all Hajj/s go to Mina,

29:30.090 --> 29:31.978
which means our target probably
would have had to have kept

29:32.090 --> 29:34.786
his hotel room as a place
to store the device.

29:34.890 --> 29:37.791
Logic says that he wrl/ wait
unt/l the last day
to release the plague.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.949
That way, the Hajj/s won ’t be
symptomatic unt/l
they’re back home,

29:41.060 --> 29:43.551
and the virus wrl/ spread
all over the Muslim world.

29:43.660 --> 29:46.959
Hajj permits are also
necessary to gain access
to Mecca,

29:47.060 --> 29:49.119
which means if
we crossjreference
the Hajj perm/ts

29:49.230 --> 29:53.280
with the Saudi customs logs
against the names of Hajjis
registered to stay in hotels,

29:53.390 --> 29:55.278
we may find our man.

29:55.390 --> 29:58.416
But, of course, we have
to do all of this without
letting the Saudi government

29:58.520 --> 30:00.613
know that we're looking
for someone whose
very eXIstence

30:00.720 --> 30:02.995
we are not allowed
to acknowledge.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.111
Yes?

30:08.450 --> 30:11.021
[woman]
How do we know
we ’re look/ng for a man?

30:11.130 --> 30:14.019
[Joe]
0h, women aren ’t allowed
in Mecca, without
a male chaperone.

30:14.130 --> 30:16.428

30:44.120 --> 30:46.315
Out. Everyone.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.909
If you live long enough,
I imagine you might

31:06.020 --> 31:09.285
eventually get around
to figuring out how
this whole thing works,

31:09.390 --> 31:11.164
Mr. Turner.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.080
We're out of time. We got to
call the Saudis and let them
know what's coming.

31:14.190 --> 31:16.169
[Reuel] Don't waste your time.

31:16.270 --> 31:20.013
No one in a leadership position
is willing to acknowledge
what we've done here.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.259
Acknowledging what you've
done here is the only way

31:22.360 --> 31:25.659
to prevent the rest of us
from being contaminated by it.

31:25.760 --> 31:29.503
You have a child's view
of the world, Joe.

31:29.610 --> 31:32.022
How do people like you
wind up in this building?

31:32.130 --> 31:35.782
You're the anomaly here, not I.

31:35.890 --> 31:37.903
-[Reuel] I said, get out!
-Sir, I've got an asset

31:38.010 --> 31:40.592
on a secure line, who claims
to be in Mecca,
offering to help.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.918
Who is he? Put him on the line.

31:43.020 --> 31:45.011
'She' won't talk to you.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.902
Put her on. [clears throat]

31:51.270 --> 31:53.261
[clicks phone]

31:55.950 --> 31:57.724
Hello?

31:57.830 --> 32:00.993
Why didn't you take the shot
in the car, after it crashed?

32:03.200 --> 32:06.249
I didn't think I could kill
someone in cold blood.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.351
I guess you were wrong.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.122
Yeah, I guess I was wrong.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.144
I should have taken the shot.

32:14.250 --> 32:17.003
You shouldn't speak that way
to the one person
who can help you.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.372
How much?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.028
I mean,
isn't that what you care about?

32:23.140 --> 32:25.074
I've sent you
all the routing numbers.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.614
I'll move, as soon as
I receive confirmation.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.941
-Get me the Director.
-No.

32:33.270 --> 32:34.840
[Joe] What's the hesitation?

32:34.950 --> 32:37.123
The man we know to be
a terrorist is about to
walk a plague Virus

32:37.230 --> 32:40.415
-into a heavily populated area.
-This is the only chance
we have to stop him, Reuel.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.693
You can't stop him.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.576
Hard-earned experience
has forced him to understand

32:45.680 --> 32:47.671
what you just can't accept.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.219
Either we kill them,

32:50.320 --> 32:52.220
-or they kill us.
-[phone ringing]

32:52.330 --> 32:53.706
He want to go forward with it.

32:53.810 --> 32:56.108
-I absolutely do.
-He wants to own
the whole thing.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.189
He wants to start
a fucking Holy War.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.565
No, I merely want to win
the one that we're already in.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.795
I'm sorry, sir,
you have a phone call.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.754
Who is it?

33:05.860 --> 33:07.851
It's for Mr. Abbott.

33:13.310 --> 33:14.800
-Hello.
-[doctor]
Mr. Abbott.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.525
-Yes.
- This is Doctor Peters.

33:16.630 --> 33:19.679
-I’m afraid your wife’s
condition has deteriorated.
-What?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.792
-Um. ..
-[conversation continues]

33:22.880 --> 33:24.871
Okay. Thank you.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.420
Get me the Director.

[crying]

36:44.110 --> 36:45.134
[exhales]

36:45.240 --> 36:47.231
I once asked you

36:48.240 --> 36:50.231
the number

36:51.560 --> 36:54.779
of lives that would
have to be saved

36:54.890 --> 36:57.609
for you to be willing
to sacrifice,

36:58.490 --> 36:59.980
kill,

37:00.090 --> 37:02.081
a single human being?

37:03.130 --> 37:05.132
You said, there's no number.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.691
And I asked you,
"How could you say that?"

37:11.620 --> 37:14.293
-And you said--
-If you don't pick a number,
you can't lower it.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.438
And when you said that,

37:18.550 --> 37:20.541
you were ten-years old.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.071
I'm sorry.

37:37.450 --> 37:39.725
[sighs deeply]

37:53.980 --> 37:55.982
Bye, Bob.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.821
[exhales]

39:13.780 --> 39:15.771
You home?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.591
[Joe] Hey.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.391
[speaking Italian]

39:40.450 --> 39:42.304
You know what, I can't run
in this city.

39:42.410 --> 39:43.820
It makes me want
to take my time.

39:43.930 --> 39:47.479
I ran to the Duomo.
I got distracted again,
and I walked home.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.571
[girl] Hmm-mmm.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.395
-You're going out?
-Yeah.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.388
I'm late.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.502
[speaking Italian]

40:00.310 --> 40:01.686
No, no, I gotta work.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.200
But you don't have a job.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.301
Hey, I gotta do something.
Come on.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.971
-I gotta go.
-No, you don't.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.570
-No.
-Yeah.

40:11.680 --> 40:14.274
Okay, well, listen,
tell Paolo I said hi.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.571
Okay, bye.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.739
One more.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.841
Ciao.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.216
Hello?

40:57.320 --> 40:59.322
[Joubert] I heard you left
the agency.

41:03.770 --> 41:05.761
All the guilt finally
caught up to you.

41:07.570 --> 41:09.572
It turns out you
have a conscience too.

41:11.420 --> 41:12.751
Oh?

41:12.860 --> 41:16.535
You betrayed your bosses
to save hundreds of millions
of lives.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.685
lVo.

41:19.790 --> 41:21.678
My client betrayed me.

41:21.790 --> 41:24.384
And I have a reputation
to protect.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.911
Where did you get my number?

41:32.640 --> 41:34.813
Small world, Joe.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.490
No place left to hide.

[church bells toll]

41:42.410 --> 41:44.401
Where are you?

41:44.970 --> 41:47.086
Lots of European cities
have church bells.

41:48.650 --> 41:50.652
Don ’t be paranoid.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.678
You told me _
to always be paran0id.

41:53.780 --> 41:55.714
And have you taken my advice?

41:55.820 --> 41:57.811
-Have you been careful?
-Yes.

42:00.790 --> 42:03.520
Falling in love,
isn't being careful, Joe.

42:03.630 --> 42:05.746
A lover is just
a pressure point.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.152
Another way to hurt you.

42:46.270 --> 42:48.420
[cell phone ringing]

42:50.440 --> 42:52.431
[Joubert]
You look good.

42:54.080 --> 42:55.411
What are you doing here?

42:55.520 --> 42:57.135
Work.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.231
Anyone I know?

42:59.640 --> 43:01.380
You ’re safe, don ’t worry.

43:01.490 --> 43:03.299
From me, anyway.

43:03.410 --> 43:05.549
The Agency,

43:05.650 --> 43:06.981
is another story,

43:07.090 --> 43:09.149
I'm not a threat to the Agency.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.434
They might think
you want revenge.

43:11.540 --> 43:15.192
Revenge only leads to more
revenge. I'm done
with that world.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.279
And what about you, huh?
What is this?

43:17.380 --> 43:19.757
You trying to show me
how easy it is to get to me?

43:19.860 --> 43:21.862
-Isn ’t it obvious?
-What?

43:23.910 --> 43:25.901
You're the one
who got away, Joe.

43:29.830 --> 43:31.991
Say hi,
to your girlfriend for me.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.391
You changed your mind?

43:39.760 --> 43:41.739
Yeah. Hey.

43:41.850 --> 43:43.624
Hey.

43:43.730 --> 43:45.220
Hey, you okay?

43:45.330 --> 43:46.342
-Yeah.
-Yeah. You good?

43:46.450 --> 43:48.441
Are you joining us for lunch?

Yeah. Sure.

Hey.

There you are.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.831
That's it.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.402
That's it.
