WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:05.773
I THINK I GOT A GOOD SHOT
AT WINNING THE CONTEST.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.941
NICE JOB, BROTHER.
YOU'RE IN THE LEAD.

00:07.941 --> 00:11.945
REALLY? ALL RIGHT, RENO!

00:11.945 --> 00:13.447
OH, NOW YOU'RE IN SECOND.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.482
OH.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.883
THIRD.

00:15.883 --> 00:19.353
HEY, ERNIE,
YOU'RE BACK IN THE LEAD!
REALLY?

00:19.353 --> 00:22.356
NO. HOW COULD THAT
BE POSSIBLE?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.658
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
THE CONTEST IS OVER.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.894
I NEED YOUR
PRODUCTIVITY NUMBERS.

00:26.894 --> 00:30.464
LET'S SEE
WHO'S GOING TO RENO!

00:30.464 --> 00:32.400
HEY, GEORGE!
ASK ME WHERE I'M GOING.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.268
I ALREADY KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, MOM.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.104
IT'S HOT, FULL OF SINNERS,
AND YOU'LL BE DATING HITLER.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.838
THAT'S HIS PUNISHMENT.

00:37.838 --> 00:41.909
NO, I'M GOING TO RENO BECAUSE
I AM GOING TO WIN THE CONTEST.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.011
I ASKED AROUND.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.547
NOBODY'S GOT
AS GOOD NUMBERS AS MINE.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.684
NO WAY.
YOU MADE THESE UP.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.854
UH-UH. GO OUT THERE
AND CHECK THE WAREHOUSE.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.723
GEE, I HAVEN'T WORKED SO HARD

00:55.723 --> 00:58.226
SINCE I TRIED TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO SPELL "CAT."

00:58.226 --> 01:01.395
YOU NEVER TAUGHT ME ANYTHING.
YOU JUST PUNISHED ME.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.831
I WASN'T
HOOKED ON PHONICS.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.834
I WAS HOOKED
TO A RADIATOR.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.670
LOOK, I KNOW THAT I HAVE GOT
THE HIGHEST NUMBERS.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.441
SO LIKE I TOLD THE GUY I PICKED
UP AT THIRSTY'S LAST NIGHT,

01:13.441 --> 01:17.711
CUT THE CHITCHAT
AND GIVE MAMA WHAT SHE CAME FOR.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.314
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE GATHER AROUND.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.583
LOOK, I JUST WANNA
THANK YOU ALL

01:22.583 --> 01:24.985
FOR WORKING SO HARD
THIS LAST MONTH.

01:24.985 --> 01:28.756
YOU'RE ALL WINNERS, AND YOU ALL
SHOULD BE GOING TO RENO.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.024
(cheering)
(whistles)

01:31.024 --> 01:32.993
I SAID "SHOULD"!

01:32.993 --> 01:35.263
ONLY ONE OF YOU IS GOING.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.798
JUST HAND OUT THE TRIP.
OKAY, MOM.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.234
THE WINNER IS...

01:40.234 --> 01:43.070
GINA SORENSTAM!

01:43.070 --> 01:46.440
HOT DAMN,
I'M GOING TO RENO!

01:46.440 --> 01:49.810
THIS IS CRAP! I SHOULD HAVE WON,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.612
I HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBERS.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.081
AGE DON'T COUNT,
SWEETHEART.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.285
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO KNOW

01:57.285 --> 02:02.089
THAT I DID NOT SLEEP
WITH GEORGE TO GET THIS.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.725
YEAH,
LET'S MAKE THAT CLEAR.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.894
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A TRIP FOR TWO,

02:06.894 --> 02:09.430
AND I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO TAKE WITH ME.

02:09.430 --> 02:15.068
SLEEPING IN A KING-SIZED BED
IS GONNA BE AWFULLY LONELY

02:15.068 --> 02:17.805
WITHOUT A KING.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.775
A FINE AZTEC KING.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.812
GINA, THE HOTEL IN RENO
DOESN'T HAVE TURNDOWN SERVICE,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.814
BUT I DO--NO!

02:30.083 --> 02:32.019
YOU FIXED THIS!
YOU'RE CRAZY.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.887
NO, I SHOULD HAVE WON,

02:33.887 --> 02:36.357
BUT YOU JUST COULDN'T
LET ME, COULD YOU? HUH?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.825
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.993
YOU HAVE NEVER WON ANYTHING
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE!

02:39.993 --> 02:41.762
HEY, I WON LOTS OF THINGS.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.931
YOU JUST WEREN'T THERE
TO SEE IT.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.966
A LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP,
A BATTLE OF THE BANDS,

02:45.966 --> 02:47.568
FUNNIEST KID IN THIRD GRADE.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.637
WHERE DOES A SKUNK
GO TO COLLEGE?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.339
P.U.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.476
THAT STILL HOLDS UP!

02:55.476 --> 02:58.379
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T
LET ME WIN THIS TRIP, HUH?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.348
BECAUSE I MISSED
A FEW THINGS?

03:00.348 --> 03:03.451
MOM, IT'S OVER. YOU LOST.
GET BACK TO WORK.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.018
NO, IT'S NOT OVER.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.789
YOU SCREWED ME,
AND NOW I AM GONNA GET YOU.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.424
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.994
OH... WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

03:13.994 --> 03:16.196
RAISE ME AGAIN?

03:17.698 --> 03:22.002
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO HURT ME NOW.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.238
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.277
AY, DIOS MÃ­O!

03:29.277 --> 03:32.280
WHY?!

03:34.181 --> 03:36.584
WHY DIDN'T SHE TAKE THE KIDS?!

03:39.553 --> 03:42.323
WE HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON!

03:42.323 --> 03:46.126
YOUR OVERSIZED HEAD...

03:46.126 --> 03:49.129
WHAT IS GOING ON?

03:49.129 --> 03:51.265
(screaming)

03:53.367 --> 03:57.104
"FOR EVERY DAY
I DON'T GET MY TRIP TO RENO,

03:57.104 --> 04:00.274
ONE OF YOUR LOVED ONES
WILL DIE."

04:00.274 --> 04:03.677
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

04:03.677 --> 04:09.717
YOU HAD A LIFETIME GUARANTEE.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO FIRST!

04:12.953 --> 04:14.888
YOU!

04:14.888 --> 04:17.791
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE
SOMETHING STOLEN FROM YOU?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.427
HURTS, DOESN'T IT?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.362
IF YOU TOUCH ANOTHER ONE
OF MY CLUBS, MOM,

04:21.362 --> 04:24.432
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL TAKE YOUR...

04:24.432 --> 04:27.735
I WILL HURT YOUR...

04:28.902 --> 04:33.173
DAMN IT, THERE'S NOTHING
SHE CARES ABOUT!

04:33.173 --> 04:36.944
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WE HAD A PRODUCTIVITY CONTEST
AT WORK,

04:36.944 --> 04:38.946
AND MY MOM'S MAD
BECAUSE SHE LOST.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.783
DON'T CALL ME "MOM."
YOU ARE NOT MY SON ANYMORE.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.418
YES!

04:46.587 --> 04:50.858
FINALLY, THE NIGHTMARE ENDS!

04:50.858 --> 04:52.593
MAYBE NOW I CAN FIND
A REAL MOM.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.595
I'M GONNA PUT AN AD
IN THE PAPER.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.797
"LOOKING FOR NON-SMOKER...

04:58.599 --> 05:01.101
"WILLING TO HUG...

05:01.101 --> 05:04.472
"MUST BE ADULT HEIGHT."

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
ANGIE, HE CHEATED ME.
I SHOULD HAVE WON.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.111
I HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBERS.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.646
IS THAT TRUE?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.281
DID SHE HAVE
THE HIGHEST NUMBERS?

05:14.281 --> 05:16.550
LOOK, SHE'S BEEN CHEATING
ON HER TIME CARD FOR YEARS.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.819
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THIS CONTEST?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.621
I DID THE WORK.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.723
WELL, WHOEVER DID
THE MOST WORK SHOULD WIN.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.025
I MEAN, GEORGE, YOU HAVE
TO BE A MAN OF YOUR WORD.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.362
WHY? SHE'S NEVER BEEN
A MAN OF HER WORD.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.065
SHE SAID IF I GOT A "B"

05:32.065 --> 05:34.702
THAT I COULD GO
TO TREE TOP RANGERS CAMP.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.304
WELL, I GOT THE "B"...

05:37.304 --> 05:40.140
BUT YOU NEVER LET ME GO,
DID YOU, MOM?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.743
OH, MY GOD.

05:42.743 --> 05:46.113
THAT WAS, LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.315
WHEN DOES THIS STOP?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.317
BOY, THE BUCKET
NEVER COMES UP EMPTY

05:50.317 --> 05:54.087
FROM YOUR PITY WELL,
DOES IT?

05:54.087 --> 05:58.025
WHILE ALL THE KIDS WERE CAMPING
AND GETTING INDIAN NAMES,

05:58.025 --> 05:59.827
I WAS ALONE IN THE BACKYARD.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.829
SO I HAD TO COME UP
WITH MY OWN NAME--

06:01.829 --> 06:04.498
"BOY WHO PLAYS WITH HIMSELF."

06:10.471 --> 06:12.272
AFTER I TOLD THE OTHER RANGERS
MY NAME,

06:12.272 --> 06:16.043
NOBODY WOULD DO THE SECRET
HANDSHAKE WITH ME ANYMORE.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.645
OH.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.647
GEORGE, GEORGE,
I AM SO SORRY

06:19.647 --> 06:21.649
THAT I DIDN'T
LET YOU GO CAMPING.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
I'M SORRY
I WASN'T THE PERFECT MOM.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.787
BUT I WON THIS TRIP
FAIR AND SQUARE.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.789
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.992
ANGIE, EXPLAIN TO MY MOM
WHY I CAN'T GIVE HER THE TRIP.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.026
EXPLAIN.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.665
TWO WRONGS
DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.967
THAT'S A WEIRD WAY TO PUT IT,
BUT THANK YOU.

06:41.669 --> 06:45.539
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.210
WHAT?

06:50.210 --> 06:54.482
AS HORRIBLE AS SHE WAS TO YOU--
AND YOU WERE HORRIBLE--

06:54.482 --> 06:58.719
THAT WAS IN THE PAST. YOU CAN'T
PUNISH HER FOR THAT NOW.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.421
ARE YOU SIDING WITH MY MOM?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.259
GEORGE, RIGHT IS RIGHT.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.162
NO.

07:09.162 --> 07:14.201
YOU'RE MY WIFE.
I SUPPORT YOU, YOU SUPPORT ME.

07:14.201 --> 07:18.506
THINK VERY CAREFULLY
ABOUT THE NEXT THING YOU SAY.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.709
ARE YOU SIDING WITH MY MOM?

07:21.709 --> 07:24.578
I'M SIDING WITH YOUR MOM.

07:24.578 --> 07:28.148
I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTOOD ME.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.186
I WILL LEAVE THIS HOUSE
RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU BACK ME UP.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.321
SO...

07:34.321 --> 07:35.856
ARE YOU SIDING
WITH YOUR HUSBAND,

07:35.856 --> 07:37.591
OR ARE YOU SIDING
WITH MY MOM?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.926
I'M SIDING WITH YOUR MOM.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.762
LAST CHANCE!

07:41.762 --> 07:44.231
YOUR MOM.
DAMN IT!

07:44.231 --> 07:46.934
AAH!

07:46.934 --> 07:50.070
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:53.340 --> 07:56.276
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:56.276 --> 07:57.845
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:59.312 --> 08:00.881
* YEAH

08:10.691 --> 08:13.727
MAN, OUR WAITRESS
IS BEAUTIFUL.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.463
SO, FOOL, ASK HER OUT.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.298
NO WAY.
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.634
HERE YOU GO, BOYS.
TWO MORE SHOTS OF MESCAL.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.269
ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN GET YOU?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.838
UH, YEAH, MY FRIEND HAS
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO ASK YOU.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.007
ASK HER, MAN. ASK.
ASK HER.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.342
UM...

08:29.342 --> 08:34.514
I WAS WONDERING, UM,
FRIDAY NIGHT AROUND 7:00, UM...

08:34.514 --> 08:38.518
WHAT'S YOUR SOUP GONNA BE?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.687
WE DON'T HAVE SOUP.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.890
SORRY FOR WASTING YOUR TIME.
OKAY.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.324
MY BAD.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.393
WOW, SHE DIDN'T GO
FOR THE SOUP LINE?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.962
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A LESBIAN.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.733
"WHAT'S YOUR SOUP?" Â¿ESTÃ¡ LOCO?
"WHAT'S YOUR SOUP?"

08:52.733 --> 08:55.636
GOLLY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME

08:55.636 --> 08:57.838
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS AT HOME.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.707
I CAN'T BELIEVE
ANGIE TOOK MY MOM'S SIDE

08:59.707 --> 09:01.374
AFTER ALL THAT
THAT WOMAN'S DONE TO ME.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.778
HEY, GEORGE, YOU MIGHT
HAVE HAD A ROUGH CHILDHOOD,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.880
BUT YOU GOT
A GREAT LIFE NOW, OKAY?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.750
YOU GOT ANGIE, A GREAT FAMILY,
YOU MANAGE THE PLANT,

09:09.750 --> 09:11.985
YOU GOT ANGIE.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.757
YOU SAID ANGIE TWICE.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.793
(laughing nervously)
DID I?

09:19.793 --> 09:23.664
I'M SURE IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.634
ALL I KNOW IS, FOR SOMEBODY WHO
HAS A BETTER LIFE THAN I DO,

09:26.634 --> 09:28.268
YOU SURE COMPLAIN A LOT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.004
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU HAD A GREAT MOM.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.272
DON'T DRINK THAT, GEORGE.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.407
YOU GOT THE ONE
WITH THE WORM, MAN.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.645
THAT THING HAS ALL KINDS OF
WEIRD PSYCHEDELIC PROPERTIES.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.613
NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.048
HEY, MAYBE I'LL HAVE
A PSYCHEDELIC VISION

09:41.048 --> 09:44.852
AND FORGET ALL ABOUT
MY HORRIBLE MOM.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.986
MMM.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.689
NOPE, NOTHING.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.325
SEE, I'M FINE WITH THE--
HELLO.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.526
OKAY.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.729
HEY, BUT IF YOU
START FEELING WEIRD,

09:55.729 --> 09:58.198
LET ME KNOW!

10:03.737 --> 10:05.939
(screams)

10:15.582 --> 10:17.685
THIS WILL HELP YOU
SLEEP BETTER.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.486
NO, DON'T SMOTHER ME!

10:19.486 --> 10:23.891
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.626
WHAT WAS THAT?
HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.697
KISSED YOU, FUNNY BUNNY.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.865
CINNAMON ROLL?

10:31.865 --> 10:34.802
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:34.802 --> 10:37.905
OH, YOU DOZED OFF
WATCHING TV.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.008
WHERE AM I?
YOU'RE HOME, ANGEL.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.509
HOME?

10:42.509 --> 10:46.246
ANGEL?
HEY, ARE YOU DRUNK?

10:46.246 --> 10:52.152
DRINKING BEFORE 5:00?
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.958
HEY, LOOK AT
ALL THESE PICTURES OF ME.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.995
YES, IT'S ALMOST TIME
TO PUT UP THE SUMMER ONES.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.131
SO I LIVE HERE WITH YOU?

11:04.131 --> 11:08.101
WELL, UNTIL YOU MEET A GIRL
WHO'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

11:08.101 --> 11:13.974
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
SOMEONE LIKE THAT REALLY EXISTS.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.010
YOU KNOW,
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
THAT YOU WERE
ALWAYS MEAN TO ME,

11:19.012 --> 11:20.881
TELLING ME
THAT MY HEAD WAS TOO BIG.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.083
I WOULD NEVER.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.018
GOD MADE YOUR HEAD THAT WAY

11:25.018 --> 11:28.388
SO IT COULD CRADLE
THAT BIG, WONDERFUL BRAIN.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.090
LEMONADE?

11:34.327 --> 11:35.996
WHAT'S THIS?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.464
OH, THAT'S THE WEEKEND

11:37.464 --> 11:40.667
YOU WENT CAMPING
WITH THE TREE TOP RANGERS.

11:40.667 --> 11:44.071
I WENT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

11:44.071 --> 11:47.074
I WAS THE DEN MOTHER,
SILLY.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.510
OH, WE HAD
THE BEST TIME EVER.

11:50.510 --> 11:56.016
WELL, YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT,
"CUB AT MAMA BEAR'S SIDE."

11:56.016 --> 11:59.787
THAT'S MY INDIAN NAME.
YES.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.255
AND IT'S STILL TRUE.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.257
I LOVE YOU.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.960
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.196
I LOVE YOU MORE.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.899
(laughing)

12:11.899 --> 12:14.367
THIS IS WEIRD.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.906
YOUR HAIR SMELLS LIKE SHAMPOO
INSTEAD OF CIGARETTES.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.342
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON...

12:22.342 --> 12:24.311
BUT IT'S AWESOME.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.285
I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH, MOM.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.487
ACTUALLY, HONEY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.289
NOW DON'T BE UPSET,

12:36.289 --> 12:37.991
BUT WORD AROUND
THE FACTORY IS

12:37.991 --> 12:39.426
THAT THERE ARE
GOING TO BE SOME LAYOFFS,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.795
AND YOUR NAME
HAS BEEN MENTIONED.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.164
(loudly)
ME? WHAT DID I DO?
SHH.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.167
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.702
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
IF YOU KEEP THIS JOB OR NOT.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.471
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

12:51.471 --> 12:55.508
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
"CUB AT MAMA BEAR'S SIDE."

12:55.508 --> 12:57.310
(giggles)

12:57.310 --> 12:59.546
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE!

12:59.546 --> 13:02.749
I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LET SOME OF YOU GO.

13:02.749 --> 13:07.054
IT'S A HARD DECISION TO MAKE,
SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.722
I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER
TO THE BEST DAMN MANAGER

13:09.722 --> 13:11.358
THIS PLANT EVER HAD.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.392
(laughing)

13:15.829 --> 13:17.764
THAT WOULD BE ME.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.834
WATCH OUT--HELLO.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.771
THANKS, MEL.
I GOT IT FROM HERE.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.673
NOW I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ALL A CHANCE

13:26.673 --> 13:28.675
TO FIGHT FOR YOUR JOB,
ALL RIGHT?

13:28.675 --> 13:30.043
GEORGE, YOU'RE FIRST.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.879
ERNIE.
HMM?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.147
ERNIE,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

13:34.147 --> 13:37.784
IF MY JOB IS IN JEOPARDY,
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.288
YOU SAY, "JUMP,"
I'LL SAY...

13:41.288 --> 13:43.823
"ON WHAT?"

13:43.823 --> 13:48.528
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW,
GINA.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.298
(gags)

13:53.867 --> 13:58.238
I'M GONNA GET RIGHT
TO THE POINT, GEORGE.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.740
IN YOUR DEPARTMENT,
I GOTTA FIRE ONE GUY.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.510
IT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND MIKEY CRUZ.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.146
NO, NOT MIKEY! HE'S GOT
A WIFE AND THREE KIDS!

14:06.146 --> 14:08.515
HE NEEDS HIS JOB!
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.317
OH, QUE LA, GEORGE!

14:10.317 --> 14:13.987
YOUR JOB'S AT STAKE, AND YOU'RE
STICKING UP FOR THE OTHER GUY!

14:13.987 --> 14:15.688
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.925
YOU'RE A GOOD WORKER,
BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO SOFT.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.592
I'M NOT SOFT.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.561
I WAS PLAYING MONOPOLY
LAST NIGHT WITH MY MOM,

14:21.561 --> 14:24.464
AND SHE LANDED ON MY PROPERTY,
AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY,

14:24.464 --> 14:28.068
AND I SAID,
"Â¿SABES QUÃ©? PAY UP!"

14:28.068 --> 14:32.072
GEORGE,
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.441
I'M GONNA
PROTECT YOUR JOB ON THIS.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.343
BUT YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO STICK UP FOR YOURSELF.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.079
GROW SOME BACKBONE!
I GOT... BACKBONE.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.680
PLEASE.
YOU'RE A MAMA'S BOY.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.816
YOU LIVE AT HOME,
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE GUTS

14:43.816 --> 14:45.585
TO ASK A GIRL OUT.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.154
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.522
I JUST HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYONE GOOD ENOUGH.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.693
MY MOM SAYS
SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN EXIST.

14:53.693 --> 14:57.830
THERE'S PLENTY OF WOMEN
RIGHT HERE AT THE FACTORY.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.632
WHAT ABOUT TANYA?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.701
HEY, YOU'RE COMING OVER
TO DINNER TONIGHT.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.903
WHY DON'T YOU BRING HER?
I TOLD YOU
I ALREADY HAVE A DATE.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.939
I'M BRINGING MY MOM!

15:05.939 --> 15:09.276
OH.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.278
TANYA.
YEAH?

15:11.278 --> 15:14.447
ERNIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.451
TANYA, GEORGE HAS SOMETHING
TO ASK YOU.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.090
GEORGE, COME HERE.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.359
GEORGE, COME HERE.
NO, MAN, THAT'S A GIRL!

15:26.359 --> 15:30.964
ASK HER. ASK HER.
ASK HER. ASK HER.

15:30.964 --> 15:35.702
UM, I WAS
JUST THINKING, UH...

15:35.702 --> 15:38.705
LATER ON AROUND 7:00...

15:38.705 --> 15:43.876
DO YOU THINK THERE'S STILL
GONNA BE ANY COFFEE LEFT?

15:43.876 --> 15:47.614
I GET OFF AT 6:00.
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.850
SORRY FOR BOTHERING YOU.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.452
HEY, MY BAD, MAN.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.787
SHE DIDN'T GO
FOR THE COFFEE LINE.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.289
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A LESBIAN.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.591
"WILL THERE BE
ANY COFFEE LEFT?"

15:58.591 --> 16:01.394
Â¿ESTÃ¡ LOCO? "WILL THERE
BE ANY COFFEE LEFT?"

16:07.034 --> 16:09.702
HONEY, I'M HOME!

16:09.702 --> 16:12.239
ANGIE?
HEY, GEORGE.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.111
NO!

16:18.111 --> 16:21.448
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I'M KISSING MY WIFE.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.684
THAT'S RIGHT--
YOU AND ANGIE ARE MARRIED.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.620
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

16:29.756 --> 16:33.260
NO!

16:34.761 --> 16:37.697
DUDE, I KNOW YOU
GOT A CRUSH ON MY LADY,

16:37.697 --> 16:40.467
BUT YOU GOTTA HIDE IT
BETTER THAN THAT.
SORRY.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.735
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON GEORGE.

16:42.735 --> 16:43.970
I'M FLATTERED.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.273
(giggles)

16:46.273 --> 16:49.109
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:49.109 --> 16:52.379
YEAH, WE HEARD
SOMEONE YELLING.

16:52.379 --> 16:57.317
YOU COULD HEAR THE EARTH TURNING
WITH THOSE EARS.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.420
HEY, DON'T MAKE FUN
OF MY KIDS, BROTHER.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.323
YEAH, YOUR KIDS.
OH, MAN...

17:03.323 --> 17:05.325
KIDS, WHY DON'T
YOU GO WASH UP?

17:05.325 --> 17:06.993
DINNER WILL BE READY
IN A MINUTE.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.796
GO WASH.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.100
LET'S GO. GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO.
(screaming)

17:13.100 --> 17:16.503
LOVE YOU, POOH BEAR!

17:16.503 --> 17:19.472
SO I SEE
WHAT'S FOR DINNER,

17:19.472 --> 17:21.641
PERO WHAT'S FOR DESSERT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:21.641 --> 17:24.811
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.
WATCH OUT--WAAPAAH!

17:27.447 --> 17:30.617
STOP IT!
STOP WHAT?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.285
I CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE, MAN!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.121
ANGIE'S MY WIFE!
THOSE ARE MY KIDS!

17:34.121 --> 17:36.756
THIS IS MY HOUSE,
AND THIS IS MY LIFE!

17:36.756 --> 17:39.192
YOU'RE LOSING IT, MAN.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.329
DADDY, WILL YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT GEORGE?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.331
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.533
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG!

17:46.533 --> 17:49.636
MY MOM LOVES ME,
AND IT RUINED EVERYTHING.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.708
LET ME SEE YOUR EYES.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.477
OH, YES.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.612
IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION--

17:59.612 --> 18:02.115
YOU ARE HAVING
A HALLUCINOGENIC REACTION

18:02.115 --> 18:05.318
TO EATING ME.

18:05.318 --> 18:10.557
I'M IN YOUR BELLY.
WATCH ME DANCE.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.993
(Ernie) GEORGE! GEORGE!
WAKE UP!

18:13.993 --> 18:16.829
GEORGE! GEORGE, WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!

18:16.829 --> 18:18.565
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.767
DUDE, YOU ATE THE WORM,
AND YOU PASSED OUT.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.703
OKAY...

18:23.703 --> 18:25.905
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.008
I'M THE MANAGER
OF THE FACTORY,

18:29.008 --> 18:34.181
ANGIE'S MY WIFE AND MY MOM'S
AN EVIL WOMAN, RIGHT?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.648
YEAH! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

18:35.648 --> 18:38.685
MAN, I HAD
THIS WEIRD DREAM

18:38.685 --> 18:41.888
THAT MY MOM WAS SWEET
AND SHE TOOK CARE OF ME.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.156
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.292
NO, EVERYTHING WAS BACKWARDS.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.528
YOU HAD MY JOB
AND WERE MARRIED TO ANGIE.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.729
I WAS?

18:49.729 --> 18:52.632
YOU GUYS WERE KISSING
AND EVERYTHING.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.867
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

19:01.741 --> 19:06.579
HEY, GIVE ME
EVERY FREAKING WORM YOU HAVE.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.657
BETTER THAN ERNIE, HUH?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.194
I TOLD YOU, IT WAS
A CHRISTMAS PARTY TEN YEARS AGO.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.830
HE AMBUSHED ME
UNDER THE MISTLETOE.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.898
LET IT GO.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.300
I LOVE YOU, ANGIE.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.336
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
AND THE KIDS AND EVERYTHING.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.603
I COULDN'T ASK
FOR A BETTER LIFE.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.606
MOM!
WHAT IS GOING ON?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.708
YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REALIZED, ANGIE?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.977
THAT I HAD THE GUTS
TO GO AFTER YOU,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.612
AND THE MANAGER'S JOB, TOO,

19:39.612 --> 19:42.449
ALL BECAUSE MY MOM
WAS SO TOUGH ON ME.

19:42.449 --> 19:46.953
I JUST FOUND A TINY DIAMOND
IN THE PILE OF CRAP

19:46.953 --> 19:50.423
THAT WAS MY CHILDHOOD!

19:50.423 --> 19:53.092
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.428
YOU'RE GOING TO RENO.

19:55.428 --> 19:59.098
I KNEW YOU'D BACK DOWN,
YOU BIG WUSS.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.168
THANK YOU, MOM.
FOR WHAT?

20:02.168 --> 20:03.936
FOR SAYING THINGS
LIKE THAT.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.705
I'M ANYTHING BUT A WUSS.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.040
IF YOU WEREN'T SO TOUGH ON ME,
I'D BE THE TYPE OF PERSON

20:08.040 --> 20:10.710
WHO JUST SAT BACK AND LET
SOMEBODY DESTROY MY CLUBS.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.947
INSTEAD, I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO BREAKS INTO THEIR CAR

20:14.947 --> 20:18.318
AND TAKES THIS.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.722
THAT'S MY STEERING WHEEL!

20:22.722 --> 20:25.358
YOU'LL GET IT BACK WHEN
I GET BACK MY GOLF CLUBS

20:25.358 --> 20:27.527
AND THE NEW DRIVER
YOU'RE GONNA BUY ME.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.297
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
IF I CAN'T USE MY CAR?

20:30.297 --> 20:32.299
I'M GONNA SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU

20:32.299 --> 20:33.833
THAT YOU SAID TO ME
WHEN I WAS 8

20:33.833 --> 20:38.871
AND I STEPPED ON THAT NAIL
THAT WENT THROUGH MY FOOT.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.807
NOT MY PROBLEM!

20:45.845 --> 20:49.649
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.718
HOW MANY WORMS
DID HE EAT?
I CUT HIM OFF AT FIVE.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.720
DUDE, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DANCING?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.254
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:55.254 --> 20:59.258
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DANCING ALONE?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

21:09.702 --> 21:13.973
YOU'LL HAVE
TO DIP ME, ERNIE.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.643
I DON'T HAVE ANY ARMS.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.180
OKAY, TIME TO GO HOME.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.382
ALL RIGHT,
FOLLOW THE SHINING STAR.
(giggling)
