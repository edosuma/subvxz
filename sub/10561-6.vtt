01:09.116 --> 01:11.050
- Mayor Clarkson.
- Detective Murdoch.

01:11.118 --> 01:13.620
So good of you to join us. Please,

01:13.687 --> 01:16.022
come in.

01:16.090 --> 01:17.824
My apologies

01:17.891 --> 01:21.192
for the dramatics, but this
is something I'd rather keep

01:21.260 --> 01:22.728
under our hats.

01:22.795 --> 01:25.330
The mayor has received a
rather alarming package.

01:25.397 --> 01:28.033
- From whom?
- That's what we need to find out.

01:28.101 --> 01:30.201
The sender chose to remain anonymous,

01:30.269 --> 01:33.538
for reasons you'll soon understand.

02:02.399 --> 02:04.934
He's killed it.

02:10.439 --> 02:13.709
What kind of disturbed
mind would do such a thing?

02:13.777 --> 02:16.344
What's even more disturbing is
the note that accompanied it.

02:16.412 --> 02:20.149
Please, read it.

02:20.216 --> 02:23.018
"My cloud of doom comes with advice.

02:23.086 --> 02:25.853
One hundred thousand is my price.

02:25.921 --> 02:28.856
A lack of funds will seal my plan.

02:28.924 --> 02:32.126
Today a mongrel, tomorrow man."

02:36.389 --> 02:39.224
Right. Do we know who
delivered this package?

02:39.291 --> 02:42.729
A street boy, an urchin. The
desk clerk will have the details.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.831
Has anyone else touched this film?
Celluloid is quite impressionable.

02:45.898 --> 02:47.733
We may still be able to raise fingermarks.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.136
Excuse me, Detective, are you
telling me this is possible?

02:51.204 --> 02:54.972
The film appears to be authentic.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.674
I was hoping you'd talk some
sense into Chief Constable Giles

02:57.743 --> 03:00.144
and tell me this is an elaborate prank.

03:00.212 --> 03:01.746
As Chief Constable,

03:01.813 --> 03:03.881
I'm entrusted with the
protection of the citizenry.

03:03.949 --> 03:06.848
It's not a task I take lightly.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.224
Mayor Clarkson,

03:08.225 --> 03:11.554
there are a number of gases
that are known to be deadly.

03:11.622 --> 03:13.556
Some have been around for centuries.

03:13.624 --> 03:14.924
We have to take this threat seriously.

03:14.930 --> 03:18.294
If there's even a hint that the
lives of the citizens are at risk,

03:18.362 --> 03:20.429
we must be seen to be taking firm action.

03:20.497 --> 03:22.665
If word gets out, the
city will be in a panic.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.167
No one will hear of this.

03:24.235 --> 03:25.666
You have my word.

03:25.670 --> 03:31.039
If we elect to dismiss this
threat, a man's life may be at risk.

03:31.107 --> 03:33.776
Sirs, if I may...

03:33.843 --> 03:36.145
"Today a mongrel, tomorrow man."

03:36.212 --> 03:40.582
I believe the threat is intended for
the general public, not just one man.

03:40.650 --> 03:43.284
We're looking for a boy.

03:43.351 --> 03:46.254
Five-foot-two, red hair, last seen

03:46.321 --> 03:48.256
at the corner of Portland and Wellington.

03:48.323 --> 03:50.057
George, Henry,

03:50.075 --> 03:53.177
I want you to examine
every frame of that film,

03:53.245 --> 03:57.513
looking for fingermarks. And
also, review the film itself

03:57.581 --> 03:59.515
looking for reflections,

03:59.583 --> 04:02.185
shadows, anything that might
help us find the location.

04:02.253 --> 04:05.521
Sir, might I request that Higgins be
the one to review the moving picture?

04:05.589 --> 04:07.223
He has a very sharp eye, and

04:07.291 --> 04:09.825
that way I could help the lads
look for the street urchin.

04:09.893 --> 04:11.494
Why?

04:11.562 --> 04:14.530
Well, as you know, sir, I
am a dog owner myself, and...

04:14.598 --> 04:17.132
What are you trying to tell me, George?

04:17.200 --> 04:20.002
Sir, I think the contents of the moving
picture would not sit well with me.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.503
George!

04:21.571 --> 04:23.772
All right, I'm sorry, sir.
Henry, let's get to work.

04:23.839 --> 04:26.841
Murdoch.

04:26.909 --> 04:27.694
Have you seen this?

04:27.699 --> 04:30.159
Mary Knowles is about to get the long drop.

04:30.163 --> 04:33.415
Well, yes, sir. She did
murder her father, sir.

04:33.483 --> 04:36.384
A sweet old clergyman. Shot
him right between the eyes.

04:36.451 --> 04:39.119
Didn't even express a word of remorse.

04:39.187 --> 04:41.889
There's definitely something
in the air, Murdoch.

04:41.956 --> 04:45.859
A woman being hanged, some
crazy nutcase gassing dogs...

04:45.927 --> 04:47.461
He may not be that crazy, sir.

04:47.529 --> 04:49.863
You think that gas is
as deadly as it seems?

04:49.931 --> 04:51.365
I don't know.

04:51.433 --> 04:54.434
But I may know someone who can tell us.

04:57.394 --> 04:58.860
Hello?

04:58.928 --> 05:00.996
Dr. Prasad?

05:02.966 --> 05:04.933
Dr. Sanjay Prasad?

05:05.001 --> 05:08.571
Detective Murdoch.

05:08.638 --> 05:12.207
I hope I may be of some service.

05:19.058 --> 05:21.993
Gases tend to be most
effective in enclosed spaces...

05:22.061 --> 05:24.696
underground mines, bunkers,
that sort of thing...

05:24.763 --> 05:27.264
so effective that last
year at the Hague Convention

05:27.332 --> 05:30.968
a declaration was put forth banning
asphyxiating gases from warfare.

05:31.036 --> 05:33.704
Which was rendered all but
useless when the United States

05:33.771 --> 05:36.606
- and Great Britain refused to sign it.
- Mm.

05:36.674 --> 05:38.475
But this is outdoors.

05:38.543 --> 05:43.947
- Which speaks to its potency.
- Which speaks very loudly to its potency.

05:44.014 --> 05:46.682
Right. Thank you for your help, Doctor.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.986
- I'll be in touch.
- Detective.

05:49.904 --> 05:53.206
If this moving picture is
real, this man has created

05:53.273 --> 05:56.176
a whole new compound with
a capacity for destruction

05:56.243 --> 05:59.044
the likes of which we have never seen.

06:04.718 --> 06:06.785
What about his voice?

06:06.853 --> 06:08.821
Did he have an accent,

06:08.888 --> 06:10.823
or a stutter perhaps?

06:10.890 --> 06:12.724
He didn't say much.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.726
I guess he was Canadian.

06:14.793 --> 06:17.695
- It's hard to tell.
- Was it was deep or thin?

06:17.763 --> 06:21.498
The tenor of a young man, or old?

06:21.566 --> 06:24.035
Was the man who gave you he package tall?

06:24.103 --> 06:25.655
Was he short? Fat? Dapper?

06:25.660 --> 06:27.560
Look at me when I'm talking to you, lad.

06:27.652 --> 06:29.076
Sir, there's something you should know...

06:29.077 --> 06:30.579
Oh, these little guttersnipes,

06:30.580 --> 06:33.143
they like to shut down in
front of coppers, Murdoch.

06:33.211 --> 06:35.178
Sometimes you have to show them the light.

06:35.246 --> 06:37.748
That would be a stroke
of good fortune, sir...

06:37.815 --> 06:39.249
seeing the light.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.284
Are you getting fresh with me, sunshine?

06:41.352 --> 06:45.020
- Sir, the boy is blind.
- Since I was wee, sir. Measles.

06:51.061 --> 06:53.162
Right, then.

06:53.230 --> 06:54.764
Carry on, Murdoch.

06:57.729 --> 07:00.930
How horrible. Do you know what he used?

07:00.998 --> 07:03.199
We are attempting to find that out.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.969
I'm consulting with Dr.
Sanjay Prasad on the matter.

07:06.037 --> 07:08.304
I know him by reputation, of course.

07:08.372 --> 07:10.674
What did say about the moving picture?

07:10.741 --> 07:13.910
He had much the same reaction as I did.

07:13.978 --> 07:16.345
We are dealing with an unknown quantity,

07:16.413 --> 07:19.347
and any attempt to assess
that quantity is paralyzed

07:19.415 --> 07:20.401
by our lack of evidence.

07:20.405 --> 07:24.853
All we have is a moving picture
of someone gassing a lone animal.

07:24.921 --> 07:27.056
Not an animal, William; a dog.

07:27.123 --> 07:29.357
- Hm?
- Dogs have become a symbol

07:29.425 --> 07:32.027
of companionship in civilized societies.

07:32.095 --> 07:36.798
The murder of a dog requires the same
cold-bloodedness as killing humans.

07:36.865 --> 07:39.200
Yet dogs are put down every day.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.703
In the name of science or mercy, perhaps,

07:41.770 --> 07:44.038
but not to illicit money.

07:44.106 --> 07:46.874
This man is callous and calculated.

07:46.942 --> 07:49.475
You can't afford to be
anything less than keen.

08:01.622 --> 08:04.424
It's hard to tell where he is,
sir. He's positioned the camera

08:04.491 --> 08:07.927
such that we only really see
a 50-foot radius of his view.

08:07.994 --> 08:10.429
It gives us no point of
reference on the horizon, sir.

08:10.496 --> 08:12.865
It could be an alley, it
could be an abandoned lot.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.967
Leaving us nowhere.

08:15.035 --> 08:16.668
Not quite.

08:16.737 --> 08:19.571
Sir, look at this shadow.

08:19.639 --> 08:21.539
It runs along the ground
and up the wall here.

08:21.607 --> 08:25.376
Now, at first we figured it
was just a large pole or a post,

08:25.444 --> 08:28.947
but this orb-shaped thing
at the top threw us a bit.

08:29.014 --> 08:32.250
I took the liberty of drawing
the image, sir, but, uh,

08:32.317 --> 08:35.053
we could find no structure
to match its dimensions.

08:35.121 --> 08:37.054
A tower, perhaps?

08:37.121 --> 08:40.057
I highly doubt that, George.
What kind of tower would have

08:40.125 --> 08:43.426
- a cantilevered bulge at the top?
- Well, I don't know sir.

08:43.494 --> 08:45.595
But I think it has some aesthetic appeal.

08:45.663 --> 08:48.398
Perhaps the orb at the top
is some sort of viewing area.

08:48.466 --> 08:52.134
George, if such a tower existed in Toronto,

08:52.315 --> 08:53.836
I'm sure we would know about it.

08:53.904 --> 08:56.072
Yes, I suppose.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.875
Without the orb,

08:58.942 --> 09:00.872
and given that the shaft comes to a point,

09:00.873 --> 09:02.393
what does that look like to you?

09:03.613 --> 09:05.547
A church steeple?

09:05.615 --> 09:07.683
Yes.

09:07.751 --> 09:13.155
And now let's say the orb is a
completely separate object altogether.

09:13.222 --> 09:15.523
Um, Henry, roll the film forward, please.

09:21.264 --> 09:23.564
Right. Now roll it back.

09:23.632 --> 09:26.634
You see? The orb is moving.

09:26.702 --> 09:30.405
- Well, I'll be.
- Gentlemen,

09:30.472 --> 09:33.073
what's round and moves in the sky?

09:41.716 --> 09:45.485
See clear across Lake
Ontario to the Great Falls

09:45.553 --> 09:50.990
and beyond! Reduce your peers
to the size of ants! Sir,

09:51.058 --> 09:52.592
you can create memories

09:52.660 --> 09:54.961
that will last a lifetime!

09:55.029 --> 09:56.896
Detective William Murdoch,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.764
Toronto Constabulary.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.700
Mr. O'Malley is it?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.669
How often do your balloons go up?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.971
Once an hour on the hour.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.906
And how long have you
been at this location?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.508
Two weeks.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.010
Are all of your flights tethered?

10:12.078 --> 10:15.313
Ever since I took the children
up from Bishop Strachan.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.582
How high does the balloon rise?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.951
Just over a thousand feet.

10:20.018 --> 10:24.021
Enough so that you can
see clear to Rochester!

10:32.196 --> 10:35.098
- What exactly are we doing, sir?
- Again, George, we are

10:35.166 --> 10:39.035
using the azimuth and elevation of
the sun to plot the balloon's shadow

10:39.103 --> 10:41.372
across the city.

10:41.439 --> 10:44.808
Now... 280.2. Right, then.

10:44.876 --> 10:48.778
Hold the string at
precisely 23 degrees, George.

10:48.846 --> 10:51.514
Sir, may I switch hands?
It's surprisingly difficult

10:51.582 --> 10:53.556
to hold one's arm aloft
for a sustained period.

10:53.557 --> 10:54.557
Just a moment, George.

10:55.018 --> 10:58.421
The balloon's shadow goes straight
past St. Alban's Anglican Church.

10:58.489 --> 10:59.803
Oh, really?

10:59.804 --> 11:02.557
My Aunt Primrose goes to that
church. It's quite nice. Mind you,

11:02.625 --> 11:04.693
- the reverend is a bit of a...
- George,

11:04.761 --> 11:06.861
are you holding the string
at precisely 23 degrees?

11:06.862 --> 11:10.599
Oh, uh... yes, sir, 23 exactly.

11:25.447 --> 11:27.982
Left behind by our friend
in the mask, I suppose?

11:28.050 --> 11:30.318
So it would seem, George.

11:43.664 --> 11:46.733
- Sir.
- What is it, George?

11:46.801 --> 11:48.835
Look around you, sir.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.367
This is where the mongrel lay.

12:03.435 --> 12:06.537
Yes. The canister was placed here.
This is where the cloud was released.

12:06.604 --> 12:09.072
Why would he remove the body?

12:09.140 --> 12:12.409
I suppose the more complex the life
form, the more it could tell us.

12:12.477 --> 12:14.777
This man doesn't want to
give away any of his secrets.

12:14.845 --> 12:19.949
Mm. I guess we'll have to rely
on more primitive life forms.

12:20.016 --> 12:22.051
How do you mean?

12:26.156 --> 12:28.991
The gas killed everything in its path.

12:29.059 --> 12:30.992
You see this weed?

12:31.060 --> 12:35.764
The tissue has broken down,
draining it of life and colour.

12:35.832 --> 12:38.900
And yet we are 50 feet from the canister.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.470
Have you seen this type
of destruction before?

12:41.537 --> 12:44.373
It's a common reaction to
a number of poisonous gases.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.109
What's peculiar about this case is

12:49.177 --> 12:52.546
the size of the canister relative
to the area of destruction.

12:52.614 --> 12:55.416
- Mm-hmm.
- Any gas spreading with the same density

12:55.484 --> 12:57.852
in a three-dimensional
space will be diminished

12:57.919 --> 13:00.120
to the cube of the distance
from its the source.

13:00.188 --> 13:03.890
Precisely. Which means a gas
that has X potency at 10 feet

13:03.957 --> 13:06.526
will have 1/8 X potency at 20 feet,

13:06.594 --> 13:09.362
1/27 X potency at 30 feet.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.931
Until, at 100 feet from
the source, it will be

13:11.999 --> 13:14.342
diminished to one thousandth
of its original density.

13:14.344 --> 13:17.114
And yet, at 100 feet...

13:17.115 --> 13:20.317
This gas maintains its
destructive properties.

13:20.573 --> 13:25.210
But just a few inches further...

13:25.278 --> 13:28.914
and these weeds show no sign of necrosis.

13:28.981 --> 13:31.182
Perhaps there was a shift in the wind.

13:31.250 --> 13:35.887
Or this could be the boundary
of the compound's effectiveness.

13:35.954 --> 13:38.423
The question is: what are its components?

13:38.490 --> 13:40.792
- How is it working?
- Well, unfortunately,

13:40.859 --> 13:42.878
a few crumpled-up weeds
won't tell us much.

13:42.879 --> 13:43.879
As you suggest,

13:44.530 --> 13:47.565
we'd do better to examine
more complex life forms.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.366
Yes.

13:49.435 --> 13:52.569
If this is going to become commonplace,

13:52.637 --> 13:55.439
I'll need a more-appropriately
sized scalpel.

13:58.509 --> 14:01.213
Is this your first rodent post-mortem?

14:01.214 --> 14:03.440
In a professional capacity, yes.

14:04.081 --> 14:06.416
It appears as though
the lungs have ruptured.

14:06.483 --> 14:09.885
This creature suffocated, and, by
the looks of it, quite violently.

14:09.953 --> 14:13.823
This gas must have fatally interacted
with the proteins in the lungs.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.926
We found affected rodents
over 100 feet apart.

14:16.993 --> 14:18.894
I've never seen anything like it.

14:18.962 --> 14:22.564
This is something new, a hybrid of sorts.

14:22.631 --> 14:26.568
So, how does one find a gas
that is not yet known to exist?

14:26.635 --> 14:28.803
Gases are compounds of existing elements.

14:28.871 --> 14:31.238
If we were able to isolate
even one of the components...

14:31.306 --> 14:33.641
We would have a better chance
of determining the others.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.043
Yes, but we need to find
something this man touched

14:36.111 --> 14:39.646
before the chemicals
turned into a gaseous state.

14:44.385 --> 14:46.820
Right, George, could you
please switch off the light?

14:51.392 --> 14:54.660
- Remarkable.
- The filter

14:54.728 --> 14:58.297
blocks out all visible light but allows
ultraviolet light to pass through.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.634
Which is exposing trace
phosphors on the glove.

15:01.702 --> 15:04.069
Now, sodium hypochlorite
fluoresces like this.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.438
Could common bleach be
one of the components?

15:06.507 --> 15:08.941
Oh, sir, common bleach
can cause plenty of damage.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.810
I was once trying to remove a stain
from the seat of my trousers...

15:11.878 --> 15:16.447
I'd sat in a rhubarb pie that
my Aunt Hyacinth baked for my...

15:16.516 --> 15:20.364
Ooh. It's not the bleach that's the vexation here;

15:20.365 --> 15:23.021
it's the gaseous compound
that it has helped create.

15:23.088 --> 15:28.025
So, what compound, when
combined with common bleach,

15:28.092 --> 15:31.996
- will create our
so-called doom cloud?- Sir.

15:32.063 --> 15:35.566
It's the mayor's office,
sir. You've been summoned.

15:49.813 --> 15:52.148
Thank you for joining us, Detective.

15:52.215 --> 15:54.751
The situation has been elevated.

15:54.818 --> 15:56.986
Our blind urchin has
delivered another message

15:57.054 --> 15:59.487
from our miscreant in
the mask. Read it aloud.

15:59.556 --> 16:02.658
"The urchin knows the point of pay.

16:02.725 --> 16:04.993
The information he'll relay.

16:05.061 --> 16:07.162
Should my demands not be employed,

16:07.229 --> 16:09.998
then Cabbagetown will be destroyed."

16:10.066 --> 16:12.968
Respectfully, Mr. Mayor, are
we really going to give in

16:13.036 --> 16:15.903
to some pompous lunatic with
a flair for playground rhymes?

16:15.971 --> 16:19.106
The safety of the city
is paramount. We evacuate.

16:19.174 --> 16:21.508
Evacuate Cabbagetown?

16:21.577 --> 16:23.510
Do you realize what that entails?

16:23.579 --> 16:25.613
Hundreds of homes, boarding houses,

16:25.681 --> 16:28.415
six churches, two schools,
and the women's prison.

16:28.483 --> 16:31.317
- And my own bloody station house.
- I'm sure, Inspector, that

16:31.385 --> 16:34.187
you'd prefer an empty station
house to a full mortuary.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.255
Evacuation's out of the question.

16:36.323 --> 16:38.391
It will throw the city into chaos.

16:38.459 --> 16:41.461
Murdoch, what say you to all of this?

16:43.464 --> 16:48.366
The damage left behind at his test
site was worse than we had anticipated.

16:48.434 --> 16:50.402
Exactly why we should take action.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.072
Then every option should be on the table...

16:53.139 --> 16:55.440
including giving in to the ransom.

16:55.508 --> 16:57.442
With respect, Mr. Mayor,

16:57.510 --> 17:00.779
you'll be opening the floodgates to
every crackpot this side of the Atlantic.

17:00.847 --> 17:05.249
Thank you, Inspector. I'll take
your words into consideration.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.484
I'm sure you will.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.587
Good day.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.329
Margaret.

17:20.396 --> 17:22.332
Thomas. You called for me?

17:22.398 --> 17:24.768
Yes, yes, yes. Come in. Have a seat.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.510
How are the children?

17:33.577 --> 17:36.545
Uh, fine. Is something wrong?

17:36.613 --> 17:39.548
I got to thinking: when was the last time

17:39.616 --> 17:42.018
you took the boys to visit
Aunt Lizzy at the Falls?

17:42.085 --> 17:44.887
It's been a while since they've
been on the Maid Of The Mist.

17:44.955 --> 17:46.922
They've always enjoyed that.

17:46.990 --> 17:49.191
What brought this up?

17:49.259 --> 17:51.192
I overheard Higgins talking about it.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.361
Apparently the weather's
going to be lovely.

17:53.428 --> 17:56.731
Are you sure everything's all right?

17:56.799 --> 18:00.035
Everything's fine.

18:00.102 --> 18:03.138
Give your sister a call.

18:03.205 --> 18:05.903
The money is to be dropped in a fountain

18:05.904 --> 18:09.147
near the corner of King and
Tecumseth at precisely 4pm.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.811
He said he'll be watching, sir.

18:10.879 --> 18:13.413
And he told me to tell you
that if he sees any coppers,

18:13.481 --> 18:15.315
the deal's off.

18:17.385 --> 18:19.920
Is someone else here, sir?

18:19.988 --> 18:22.689
Uh, yes, Riley.

18:22.756 --> 18:25.658
I'd like you to meet Dr. Sanjay Prasad.

18:25.726 --> 18:29.095
- Hello, Riley.
- Hello. - Riley,

18:29.163 --> 18:31.097
if you recall, last time we met,

18:31.165 --> 18:33.265
I asked you to engage your other senses

18:33.333 --> 18:35.802
in the event that you
meet the masked man again.

18:35.869 --> 18:38.304
- Yes, sir. And I did, sir.
- Very good.

18:38.371 --> 18:41.606
In that case, Dr. Prasad
has a few questions for you.

18:44.643 --> 18:49.280
Were you able to detect an odour
from this man, even a faint one?

18:49.348 --> 18:51.883
- Yes, sir.
- Good. We have reason

18:51.951 --> 18:54.819
to believe he's working with
some very powerful chemicals.

18:54.886 --> 18:57.788
I have a few ideas, but I need your help

18:57.856 --> 19:01.125
to narrow them down.

19:01.193 --> 19:04.095
Too smoky.

19:04.162 --> 19:07.098
Too pungent. No.

19:07.165 --> 19:09.967
These aren't even close.

19:10.035 --> 19:12.969
It was much sweeter, like...

19:13.037 --> 19:14.704
rotten fruit.

19:18.008 --> 19:20.844
During the Civil War, a
New York school teacher,

19:20.911 --> 19:23.713
John Doughty, proposed
the use of chlorine gas.

19:23.781 --> 19:27.315
But it was deemed too inhumane for
warfare and never heard from again.

19:27.383 --> 19:30.452
It was said to smell of
pineapple and peppers.

19:30.519 --> 19:33.488
- Then our man has found a way to recreate it.
- Not just recreate,

19:33.556 --> 19:36.225
but intensify its properties by a thousand.

19:36.292 --> 19:38.660
And I'm not yet sure how he has done it.

19:38.728 --> 19:41.897
But he's used chlorine gas as its base.

19:41.965 --> 19:44.565
Precisely. And one of
the two major components

19:44.633 --> 19:47.534
- of chlorine gas is bleach.
- And what's the other?

19:47.602 --> 19:50.671
Ammonia, or formula NH3,

19:50.739 --> 19:53.607
sometimes listed as hydrogen nitride.

19:57.612 --> 20:00.113
Ammonia and chlorine?

20:00.181 --> 20:02.916
There was a rather large order
that came down here last week.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.733
Never seen the gentleman before,
so I tried to make small talk,

20:05.734 --> 20:07.322
but he didn't take to it.

20:08.055 --> 20:11.258
- Did he give you a name?
- No.

20:11.326 --> 20:14.428
He was tall, dark hair,
American, if I recall.

20:14.496 --> 20:17.397
Said he was using the canisters
to make fertilizer of some kind.

20:17.464 --> 20:20.433
Ah, here we are.

20:22.436 --> 20:28.374
A dozen 124-pound XP
canisters of ammonia NH3,

20:28.442 --> 20:31.410
delivered to 83 Bleecker
Street. Is that correct?

20:31.477 --> 20:33.612
Oh, yes. It was a whale of a job.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.515
- Took me three trips.
- That's a lot of fertilizer,

20:36.582 --> 20:39.017
especially for a city dweller.

21:04.376 --> 21:05.810
Sir.

21:05.877 --> 21:08.813
Ammonia and bleach bottles.
There's dozens of them.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.816
- This is empty.
- They're all empty.

21:12.884 --> 21:14.918
We're too late.

21:22.937 --> 21:25.271
The innards of a timepiece, sir?

21:25.339 --> 21:27.507
Yes, George, one that's been modified.

21:27.575 --> 21:31.777
He seems to have been working on
some sort of time-release mechanism.

21:31.845 --> 21:35.047
Sir, do you think he's really
succeeded in building this...

21:35.116 --> 21:37.250
doom cloud?

21:37.318 --> 21:41.220
I don't know, George. Just keep looking.

21:41.287 --> 21:43.555
What do you make of all this, Dr. Prasad?

21:43.623 --> 21:47.859
We have a dozen ammonia
and 20 canisters of bleach,

21:47.927 --> 21:50.229
all empty. But what's more curious is

21:50.296 --> 21:52.731
what must have been inside here.

21:52.798 --> 21:55.000
This canister was pressurized, which means

21:55.067 --> 21:58.503
the mystery compound is itself a gas.

21:58.570 --> 22:00.838
And when combined with
the other ingredients,

22:00.905 --> 22:03.608
creates a doom cloud.

22:03.675 --> 22:05.443
Right.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.381
You can't see it, and you can't smell it,

22:10.449 --> 22:12.582
but it'll kill you. Incinerate you is

22:12.650 --> 22:15.018
what I heard, leaving nothing but bones.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.653
Gentlemen!

22:16.720 --> 22:20.290
Our prayers have been answered!
On loan from Station 10,

22:20.358 --> 22:21.945
the Fire Department have
generously offered us

22:21.946 --> 22:23.749
some of their most modern technology.

22:24.061 --> 22:27.730
Should the cloud of doom
make its way to Station 4,

22:27.798 --> 22:30.666
we will be prepared. Behold...

22:30.733 --> 22:32.668
the breathing masks!

22:32.735 --> 22:36.172
Looks like ghoul masks. You
really think these'll work?

22:36.239 --> 22:39.341
- It smells like wet dog.
- Higgins.

22:39.409 --> 22:42.744
- And there's only five of them.
- Well, we'll have

22:42.812 --> 22:44.745
to share, I suppose, if it comes to that.

22:44.813 --> 22:48.149
- Is there supposed to be a crack in this?
- A crack?

22:48.217 --> 22:50.451
Look, we have nothing to worry about.

22:50.519 --> 22:53.054
Do you honestly think
that the cloud of doom

22:53.121 --> 22:55.790
could stand a chance against this?

23:10.071 --> 23:11.871
Julia.

23:11.939 --> 23:15.442
Is it true that Cabbagetown is in danger?

23:15.510 --> 23:19.846
I wouldn't pay much attention to
what the constables are saying.

23:19.914 --> 23:22.949
It wasn't the constables who
brought it to my attention.

23:23.017 --> 23:25.051
Ah.

23:25.119 --> 23:27.420
Why didn't you tell me?

23:27.487 --> 23:29.789
We don't yet know if the threat is real.

23:29.857 --> 23:31.557
But it could be.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.226
It's too early to make that assessment.

23:36.429 --> 23:40.899
Julia... everything will be fine.

23:40.967 --> 23:43.035
Sir?

23:43.103 --> 23:45.137
You've been summoned again.

23:58.383 --> 24:00.317
Ah, Detective Murdoch.

24:00.385 --> 24:02.754
Come in.

24:02.821 --> 24:05.222
Would you like a pull, detective?

24:05.289 --> 24:06.823
No, thank you.

24:06.891 --> 24:09.226
A man of integrity.

24:09.293 --> 24:11.594
That's why I called you
here in the first place.

24:14.331 --> 24:17.333
Mayor Clarkson, if I may,

24:17.401 --> 24:20.470
though your job may seem
impossible at the moment,

24:20.537 --> 24:24.673
the people of this city need
you. Their fate is in your hands.

24:24.741 --> 24:27.109
We have the money.

24:27.177 --> 24:28.911
You do?

24:28.979 --> 24:31.013
I've spoken with the treasury department.

24:31.081 --> 24:32.207
They've emptied the coffers.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.197
One hundred thousand dollars.

24:34.198 --> 24:36.388
While negotiating with vermin

24:36.389 --> 24:40.054
is a displeasing pill to swallow...

24:40.122 --> 24:43.291
I will not endanger
the citizens of Toronto.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.860
A wise decision.

24:45.928 --> 24:49.030
And you're the man to
orchestrate the drop-off.

24:49.098 --> 24:51.699
You must do everything in your power

24:51.767 --> 24:53.834
to unmask this man in the process.

24:53.935 --> 24:55.368
Do you understand?

24:55.436 --> 24:57.671
Yes, sir.

24:57.738 --> 25:00.340
Thank you, Detective.

25:00.408 --> 25:02.609
And Godspeed.

25:02.677 --> 25:04.111
Oh,

25:04.179 --> 25:07.480
and that fate of the city you mentioned?

25:07.548 --> 25:10.749
It's in your hands now.

25:13.253 --> 25:16.355
The money is to be put
in an unmarked oilskin bag

25:16.423 --> 25:18.590
and placed in the fountain
at King and Tecumseth.

25:22.762 --> 25:26.464
I want all constables to
maintain constant visual contact

25:26.532 --> 25:28.266
with the drop-off point.

25:30.436 --> 25:33.071
Any communications that you
wish to make will be handled

25:33.139 --> 25:35.874
via the call boxes that we have designated.

25:35.942 --> 25:40.145
Now, the man in question will
be picking up the package at 4pm.

25:43.048 --> 25:46.450
It is imperative that
you are not recognized.

25:48.519 --> 25:52.723
If he sees anything suspicious,
we will be placing the city

25:52.790 --> 25:54.791
at extreme risk.

26:07.771 --> 26:09.205
What do you think?

26:09.273 --> 26:11.975
Pick it up! We're not leaving
a hundred thousand dollars

26:12.042 --> 26:14.509
lying around on the street all night.

26:14.577 --> 26:17.712
- He didn't show?
- What's his game, Murdoch?

26:17.780 --> 26:20.482
I don't know, sir. We did what he asked.

26:20.549 --> 26:22.851
Our men were invisible,
the money was there.

26:22.919 --> 26:25.320
Why would he turn his back on his own plan?

26:25.388 --> 26:28.590
I think... we could both use a drink.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.531
Whoa! Here's comes trouble!

26:37.599 --> 26:40.134
Come here, Bobby! Daddy!

26:40.202 --> 26:42.503
- John.
- Father.

26:42.570 --> 26:46.039
We're going to Aunt Lizzy's
today, taking the Maid of the Mist.

26:46.107 --> 26:48.841
- Why don't you come?
- I would love to, Bobby,

26:48.910 --> 26:51.544
but your father has
got a lot of work to do.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.280
But what about the doom cloud?

26:53.347 --> 26:55.882
Oh, I wouldn't believe
everything you hear, John.

26:55.950 --> 26:58.451
Besides, if there was a cloud of doom,

26:58.519 --> 27:00.820
it would be no match for...

27:00.888 --> 27:02.487
The Mask of Glory!

27:02.555 --> 27:04.356
Raaaa!

27:07.360 --> 27:11.397
You see, this breathing mask will
keep your old man as right as rain.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.135
All right, John, here's a few pennies.

27:17.202 --> 27:19.203
Constable Burns will
take you for some sweets.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.205
- Thank you, Father.
- Be good.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.241
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye-bye.

27:25.277 --> 27:29.047
Sir, you do know that a mask
designed to filter out smoke is

27:29.114 --> 27:30.982
likely to be ineffective against...

27:31.050 --> 27:32.983
Of course I bloody know, Murdoch.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.985
But let's keep that between ourselves.

27:35.053 --> 27:36.433
No need to enlighten the constables.

27:36.434 --> 27:37.487
Detective Murdoch.

27:38.545 --> 27:40.757
There's a telephone call in
your office, right away sir.

27:45.028 --> 27:47.464
- Detective Murdoch.
- I said no police.

27:47.531 --> 27:48.856
We did exactly as you asked.

27:48.857 --> 27:51.502
There were no officers present,
and every penny was delivered.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.771
I saw. The deal was no police.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.605
My price is now one million.

27:56.673 --> 27:59.775
You have eight hour.

28:02.311 --> 28:06.147
A million dollars?! Impossible!

28:06.214 --> 28:08.149
Even if we wanted to, we
couldn't float enough bonds

28:08.216 --> 28:10.818
- to cover the cost!
- What happened, Brackenreid?

28:10.886 --> 28:12.092
How did he find out we were watching him?

28:12.493 --> 28:13.093
I don't know, sir.

28:14.222 --> 28:16.257
Our constables were in plain clothes.

28:16.324 --> 28:18.793
They maintained a discreet
distance from the drop-off.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.895
- We were careful.
- Ha! Not careful enough.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.864
Maybe someone in the constabulary
is working with the fiend.

28:23.932 --> 28:25.833
You mean someone from Station House n°4?!

28:25.901 --> 28:27.334
Gentlemen,

28:27.402 --> 28:29.368
I don't think this is about money.

28:29.436 --> 28:32.172
Not about money? He's
asking for a million dollars!

28:32.239 --> 28:35.775
Exactly. He knows the city
couldn't possibly pay that.

28:35.843 --> 28:38.111
He seems determined to
carry out his threat.

28:38.179 --> 28:39.612
To what end?

28:39.680 --> 28:42.182
We're not the only city
he can hold hostage.

28:42.249 --> 28:44.549
He wants to make an example of us.

28:44.617 --> 28:46.118
Of course.

28:46.186 --> 28:50.588
My God. He could hold
the whole world to ransom.

28:57.797 --> 28:59.431
Gentlemen.

28:59.498 --> 29:03.134
It appears that we've just
located the cloud of doom.

29:11.343 --> 29:13.878
Hidden in plain sight. Brilliant.

29:13.946 --> 29:16.880
You say a child spotted this?

29:16.981 --> 29:19.515
Bloody lucky he didn't
start mucking around with it.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.169
Can we disable the timer?

29:40.237 --> 29:43.438
The valve is electrically controlled,

29:43.506 --> 29:45.607
but the power is keeping the valve shut.

29:45.675 --> 29:49.143
Any attempt to interrupt the circuit
will allow the valve to spring open.

29:49.211 --> 29:51.479
Can we manually close the valve?

29:51.546 --> 29:53.327
Not without releasing
at least some of the gas.

29:53.328 --> 29:56.192
We'd likely all be dead before we succeeded.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.254
Look, the canister is pressurized

29:59.255 --> 30:01.422
to 200 pounds per square inch.

30:01.490 --> 30:05.725
If we were to put this in
a sealed drum... and drop it

30:05.793 --> 30:07.794
to a depth where the
pressure would be equalized...

30:07.862 --> 30:10.097
The gas would never be released.

30:10.164 --> 30:11.965
Right.

30:12.033 --> 30:16.203
Gentlemen... let's go.

30:16.271 --> 30:18.138
Jackson.

30:18.206 --> 30:20.572
Be careful, lads.

30:23.210 --> 30:25.378
Seems we're attracting
a bit of a crowd, sir.

30:25.445 --> 30:28.314
Right, George, keep them back.
I don't want to take any chances.

30:28.382 --> 30:29.916
Yes, sir.

30:37.523 --> 30:39.857
Bloody hell!

30:49.936 --> 30:54.204
It's fine. It's fine. The
canister hasn't been breached.

30:54.272 --> 30:56.640
Just get it on the wagon, Jackson.

30:56.707 --> 30:58.708
Carefully.

30:58.776 --> 31:02.379
Whew!

31:06.884 --> 31:10.053
To the bravest coppers this
side of the 49th parallel!

31:10.120 --> 31:13.356
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers!

31:13.424 --> 31:17.460
Where's Detective Murdoch? He
should be enjoying his triumph.

31:17.527 --> 31:20.129
He's not usually one for praise, Mr. Mayor.

31:20.197 --> 31:21.664
Or drinking.

31:21.731 --> 31:23.399
Rubbish!

31:27.803 --> 31:29.271
Cheers, lads!

31:29.339 --> 31:32.841
Not joining us, Detective?

31:32.908 --> 31:36.945
I fear the festivities
might be somewhat premature.

31:41.616 --> 31:45.286
The canister has been safely sunk
to the bottom of Lake Ontario.

31:45.354 --> 31:48.422
- One of them.
- How do you mean?

31:48.490 --> 31:52.559
The lethal gas is comprised
of ammonia, bleach,

31:52.627 --> 31:55.096
and a third component: compound X.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.830
I've done the calculations five times.

31:57.898 --> 31:59.966
The gas man procured enough materials

32:00.034 --> 32:03.703
to create 25,000 cubic
feet of this deadly mixture.

32:03.770 --> 32:06.106
And how large was your canister?

32:06.173 --> 32:09.175
Two thousand five hundred cubic feet.

32:09.243 --> 32:13.912
There may be as many as nine
other canisters out there.

32:13.980 --> 32:17.516
It seems that the fate of the city
is back in your hands, Mr. Mayor.

32:19.619 --> 32:23.755
- When do you believe these might go off?
- We have less than six hours.

32:26.692 --> 32:30.594
Gentlemen, we have no choice.

32:30.662 --> 32:33.697
We must evacuate the city.

32:38.403 --> 32:41.698
The evacuation area is Gerrard to
Queen, Parliament to the Don River.

32:41.699 --> 32:44.205
You've each been assigned a section within the boundaries

32:44.206 --> 32:45.464
to make sure the public leave.

32:45.148 --> 32:47.850
Crabtree, you're Section
A; Wilton to Sydenham,

32:47.917 --> 32:49.228
with Sackville as your western boundary;

32:49.229 --> 32:51.872
Jackson, you're Section B, Sackville to Sumach.

32:52.443 --> 32:53.522
What is it, Higgins?

32:53.589 --> 32:55.924
I'm just wondering about
the women's prison, sir.

32:55.992 --> 32:58.794
- What, you can't handle a few slappers?
- It's not that, sir.

32:58.862 --> 33:02.196
I'm just wondering if we should
give priority to the civilians.

33:02.264 --> 33:04.331
Higgins has a good point, sir.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.628
I mean, one of them is
scheduled to be hanged tomorrow.

33:06.629 --> 33:08.272
It seems a bit counter-productive.

33:08.273 --> 33:10.237
This is not the time
for armchair philosophy.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.790
Now, you've all got your
areas. Get on with it.

33:15.839 --> 33:18.875
Crabtree, a word. You might
want to check that your

33:18.942 --> 33:21.577
medical kit is up to scratch,
if you know what I'm saying.

33:21.645 --> 33:24.113
It is, sir. I checked it this morning.

33:24.181 --> 33:26.382
Dr. Grace might want to check it herself.

33:26.449 --> 33:30.319
She's in the morgue now,
but won't be for long.

33:30.387 --> 33:32.420
Thank you, sir.

33:42.631 --> 33:44.666
- George. What a surprise.
- I was hoping

33:44.733 --> 33:47.269
I would find you here. So,
you're off, then, are you?

33:47.336 --> 33:50.171
Yes. I've been stationed
outside the evacuation zone.

33:50.238 --> 33:53.107
They're setting up an emergency
medical shelter. And you?

33:53.175 --> 33:55.609
I'll be supervising the evacuation.

33:55.677 --> 33:58.813
- Do you have your gas mask?
- Yes, of course.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.970
There's plenty. One for
everybody, spares to boot.

34:00.971 --> 34:02.620
All top-notch quality.

34:03.051 --> 34:06.119
- How fortunate.
- Yes.

34:08.889 --> 34:12.225
- So, this is it.
- This is it.

34:17.464 --> 34:21.466
- Everything's going to be fine, isn't it?
- Everything's going to be fine.

34:21.534 --> 34:23.467
I'd best be off.

34:23.536 --> 34:25.469
I'll... I'll see you on
the other side, Emily.

34:25.538 --> 34:27.072
Mmhmm.

34:48.259 --> 34:50.360
Your attention please!

34:50.428 --> 34:53.263
This is an emergency! Do not panic!

34:53.331 --> 34:56.266
We need everybody to leave
their homes immediately!

35:01.505 --> 35:03.606
Hello, William.

35:03.674 --> 35:09.278
Julia. There's an emergency medical
area just outside of the evacuation zone.

35:09.346 --> 35:12.515
- They could use your help.
- And you intend to remain?

35:12.583 --> 35:15.584
Well, yes. It's my duty. Now,

35:15.651 --> 35:19.721
- you haven't much time.
- If you're staying, I'm staying.

35:19.789 --> 35:24.192
We may not be husband and wife,
William, but I refuse to abandon you.

35:52.185 --> 35:55.555
- Artie! Artie!
- Here we go, sir.

35:55.623 --> 35:57.557
Come along. One foot in front of the other.

35:57.625 --> 36:00.960
Oh, no, no, no! I can't!

36:01.028 --> 36:03.629
Have you seen my little boy?

36:03.696 --> 36:05.931
- Artie!
- Sir, we have to keep going.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.467
If you stay here, you could
be dead in a couple of hours.

36:08.535 --> 36:11.069
Aww, I survived the
rebellion, I can survive this.

36:11.137 --> 36:14.740
Artie!

36:19.478 --> 36:21.211
Ha!

36:23.214 --> 36:25.382
Young man. Here, come with me.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.754
Be sure to do the top.

36:29.822 --> 36:31.889
We can't be too careful.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.595
Ah. Do you really think
this is going to work?

36:38.663 --> 36:40.538
I don't know.

36:40.539 --> 36:43.437
But someone has to stay back
in case there's a phone call.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.136
Henry.

36:47.204 --> 36:49.518
What are you doing here?

36:49.519 --> 36:51.555
The trace on your telephone call, sir.

36:51.556 --> 36:53.535
I'm sorry it took so long,
but all the lines were tied up.

36:53.536 --> 36:55.043
I had to go to the exchange in person.

36:55.111 --> 36:57.079
I'm afraid it won't be
much help, anyways, though.

36:57.146 --> 37:00.277
- You didn't get an address?
- Well I did, sir, but it wasn't a residence.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.484
The call came from a public telephone

37:01.551 --> 37:04.487
at the Junction Exchange.

37:04.554 --> 37:06.822
The Junction Exchange?

37:06.890 --> 37:09.424
That's right beside the chemical plant.

37:16.366 --> 37:18.333
That's it!

37:18.401 --> 37:21.536
Julia, have a look at the work order

37:21.604 --> 37:25.039
from the chemical plant
and the ransom note.

37:27.809 --> 37:30.311
Baskerville font. It's fairly common.

37:30.379 --> 37:35.816
Yes, perhaps. But look
at the lowercase "t".

37:35.884 --> 37:38.619
There's a distinct flaw.

37:45.192 --> 37:47.327
Now look at the word "destroyed".

37:47.395 --> 37:49.862
The "t" is identical.

37:49.930 --> 37:52.298
That's right.

37:52.366 --> 37:55.068
What are the chances of
two typewriters having

37:55.136 --> 37:57.569
the exact same flaw?

37:57.637 --> 37:59.604
I must say, my heart is pounding.

38:04.144 --> 38:06.912
Russell Boyes? Toronto
Constabulary! Open up!

38:06.979 --> 38:09.915
Do you hear that?

38:09.982 --> 38:12.550
It sounds like someone crying.

38:16.821 --> 38:18.956
Julia.

38:19.024 --> 38:21.292
That's the dog from the moving picture.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.429
- And he's very much alive.
- Hmm.

38:24.496 --> 38:26.197
Uh...

38:26.265 --> 38:28.798
Sit.

38:28.866 --> 38:32.102
- He's well-trained.
- Very well-trained.

38:32.170 --> 38:34.504
Lie down.

38:39.043 --> 38:40.577
Play dead.

38:43.981 --> 38:46.115
My God.

38:46.183 --> 38:48.117
It's a trick.

38:48.185 --> 38:50.286
The whole thing was a trick.

38:50.353 --> 38:55.257
He couldn't hurt a town; he
couldn't even harm the dog!

38:55.325 --> 38:57.993
Then why go through such an elaborate plan?

39:03.365 --> 39:05.400
I think I know why.

39:11.407 --> 39:14.375
Mary Knowles is about to get the long drop.

39:18.879 --> 39:21.482
He wants us out of Cabbagetown.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.618
Move along, now! Let's go. Let's go!

39:24.685 --> 39:26.987
Come on, move it.

39:27.054 --> 39:28.489
Let's go.

39:28.556 --> 39:30.357
Come on.

39:30.425 --> 39:33.292
Everyone leave! Now!

39:33.327 --> 39:36.429
Put the canister down! Slowly!

39:36.530 --> 39:38.063
This is your final warning!

39:44.466 --> 39:45.466
Put this on!

39:54.013 --> 39:56.047
Everyone stop!

39:58.217 --> 40:00.252
Arrest that man!

40:02.321 --> 40:05.856
There is no cloud of doom!

40:05.890 --> 40:09.393
The effect is created
using harmless liquid fog!!

40:11.729 --> 40:16.267
This was all an elaborate ruse
to spare your fiancée the noose.

40:16.334 --> 40:18.702
Isn't that right, Russell Boyes?

40:27.444 --> 40:29.679
They can never keep us apart.

40:29.746 --> 40:31.881
I love you.

40:33.850 --> 40:36.785
It's all right, Russell.

40:36.852 --> 40:38.887
It's all right.

40:45.895 --> 40:47.663
Get in the wagon.

40:56.370 --> 40:59.138
It was clever, I'll admit that.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.140
You were a student of chemistry.

41:01.208 --> 41:04.576
You simulated the effects of gas,

41:04.643 --> 41:07.379
using bleach to kill the plants.

41:07.447 --> 41:11.516
You suffocated rats in a
sack and scattered them about.

41:11.584 --> 41:15.720
You used pineapple extract
to create the odour,

41:15.788 --> 41:18.923
fooling even an expert like Dr. Prasad.

41:18.992 --> 41:22.159
I couldn't just do nothing and let her die.

41:22.227 --> 41:26.630
You turned a city upside-down to save
a woman who murdered her own father!

41:26.698 --> 41:28.632
It's not that simple.

41:30.602 --> 41:32.636
He did things to her.

41:34.606 --> 41:36.940
That doesn't justify murder.

41:37.008 --> 41:40.010
No, it does not. But she does regret

41:40.077 --> 41:43.046
what she did, in spite of
what the press reported.

41:43.114 --> 41:46.716
Never once did she defend
her actions at trial.

41:46.783 --> 41:48.417
How could she?

41:48.485 --> 41:51.420
How could she speak of things
that no one should hear?

41:51.488 --> 41:55.324
And even if she did, who would believe her?

41:57.594 --> 42:00.529
Mary Knowles may have suffered unjustly,

42:00.596 --> 42:03.131
but that doesn't excuse your actions.

42:05.167 --> 42:08.770
Be that as it may, it was all worth it.

42:08.838 --> 42:11.606
How can you say that?

42:11.674 --> 42:15.709
I had to show her that I loved her.

42:15.777 --> 42:20.748
She needed to know that. I owed
it to her to let her know that.

42:20.815 --> 42:24.151
Wouldn't you do the same, Detective?

42:37.898 --> 42:40.399
So, you think she has a case for a retrial?

42:40.467 --> 42:42.936
A stay of execution at the very least

42:43.003 --> 42:45.538
while she undergoes a
psychological examination.

42:45.606 --> 42:48.506
If the poor woman suffered
trauma at the hands of her father,

42:48.575 --> 42:52.243
she should be encouraged to
explain her actions in that light.

42:52.311 --> 42:55.013
But do you think she would speak of it?

42:55.081 --> 42:57.315
I don't know. But we must try.

42:57.383 --> 43:00.318
Would you be willing to pay a visit

43:00.386 --> 43:01.554
to the law courts with me?

43:02.545 --> 43:06.423
However, time is of the essence, I'm afraid.

43:06.491 --> 43:08.659
To spare a young woman's life?

43:21.896 --> 43:23.178
