00:14.114 --> 00:15.248
[background chatter]

00:27.961 --> 00:28.895
You know...

00:30.964 --> 00:32.632
All these weeks I've been waiting,

00:32.732 --> 00:34.834
just to hear from you,

00:36.469 --> 00:37.704
"I'm sorry" or...

00:39.005 --> 00:41.207
an explanation, something!

00:42.008 --> 00:44.277
- [he sighs]

00:44.344 --> 00:46.246
The fact that you got yourself

00:46.312 --> 00:48.214
from a pseudo-Thai whore

00:48.281 --> 00:51.584
That you made her so furious that

00:51.684 --> 00:53.753
But that you managed

00:53.853 --> 00:56.256
that you supposedly love

00:56.322 --> 00:58.224
- The whole world.

00:58.324 --> 01:01.194
Susa is so attractive,

01:01.294 --> 01:03.630
What is your contribution

01:03.730 --> 01:05.832
- Besides superficiality, stupidity...

01:06.666 --> 01:07.967
- Hmm?

01:08.034 --> 01:10.970
I'm so fed up with you putting me

01:11.971 --> 01:13.006
Do you mean that?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.308
What?

01:15.408 --> 01:18.511
[sighs] Fuck, no, sorry, I...

01:18.611 --> 01:19.679
Okay, let me guess.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.081
- She's here again?

01:21.147 --> 01:23.716
You make it so... You make it

01:23.783 --> 01:24.884
Susa, really...

01:24.951 --> 01:28.121
Do you have a small penis? Is it

01:28.188 --> 01:30.757
- Is that why you sleep around?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.692
- I wanted to call you, but...

01:32.759 --> 01:35.095
Therefore the drugs, otherwise

01:35.161 --> 01:37.363
Okay, I did drugs. I screwed

01:37.430 --> 01:39.766
It's none of your goddamn business,

01:39.833 --> 01:42.402
I'm trying to have a conversation,

01:42.469 --> 01:43.770
Wait. Fuck... Susa!

01:44.437 --> 01:45.872
Susa, wait! Susa!

01:45.972 --> 01:48.041
- Hey, first you pay!

01:48.108 --> 01:50.477
Let her go. You're bumming

01:50.543 --> 01:52.011
Just get the fuck away, okay?

01:52.078 --> 01:53.613
- All right, that's enough!

01:54.514 --> 01:55.882
I wasn't talking to you!

01:55.949 --> 01:57.117
[groans]

01:57.183 --> 01:58.118
God!

01:59.552 --> 02:00.487
Fuck!

02:11.798 --> 02:13.333
[Astrid] Your half-brother.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.401
I know.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.171
- It's turned out to be a month already.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.373
He's not making any effort

02:20.440 --> 02:22.642
Yeah, I know that...

02:22.709 --> 02:25.044
and I understand. You're

02:25.111 --> 02:26.746
He runs around in underwear.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.681
He eats his way through

02:28.748 --> 02:31.584
He's even stopped taking showers.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.887
This morning, he took a shower.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.488
Awesome.

02:38.424 --> 02:39.792
I'll talk to him, Astrid.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.363
You know, he's just my baby brother.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.799
- He's an asshole.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.003
- [door opens]

02:50.069 --> 02:51.504
My little asshole...

02:51.604 --> 02:53.039
- [door closes]

02:54.007 --> 02:56.209
Nice. Lesbian porn!

02:57.310 --> 02:58.478
- Can I watch?

02:59.212 --> 03:00.113
- Astrid...

03:11.758 --> 03:13.159
Carry on. I don't mind.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.962
[Astrid sighs]

03:16.696 --> 03:17.931
I will talk to him.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.110
[door slides open]

03:31.211 --> 03:32.412
[girl] Hey!

03:41.921 --> 03:43.356
I made the band at school.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.292
Good job.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.163
But really only because you
practice with me, you know.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.599
No, because you're talented.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.671
Tino's also in the band.

03:59.606 --> 04:00.506
Are you on the pill?

04:01.608 --> 04:03.243
Yuck! I'm only 12!

04:03.309 --> 04:06.679
Yeah, that's right. You don't want

04:06.746 --> 04:08.481
That's really gross!

04:08.548 --> 04:11.184
Have your mothers talked with you

04:11.284 --> 04:13.386
I will not talk about it.

04:13.486 --> 04:14.954
Yeah, but contraception

04:16.789 --> 04:19.792
Is it because you can't be faithful

04:20.526 --> 04:23.129
That's what it says online

04:23.196 --> 04:25.164
All right. You win.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.569
[strums guitar]

04:29.636 --> 04:31.437
Are you sad about Susa?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.440
[scoffs] No. Who said

04:34.507 --> 04:35.675
Do you miss her?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.611
Missing someone is boring when

04:38.678 --> 04:40.213
- Shut up!

04:40.947 --> 04:42.515
- Has she come back?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.685
- Hi, Monika!

04:45.752 --> 04:48.588
- You are.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.024
Well, Elle thinks you should get

04:51.124 --> 04:52.825
Yes, but I have a name, you know.

04:53.426 --> 04:56.396
F32.1-2011/01.

04:56.496 --> 05:01.401
She says her name is...

05:01.467 --> 05:05.805
F32.1-2011/01.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.608
- 01 for the status as valedictorian...

05:08.675 --> 05:10.677
F22.3/...

05:10.743 --> 05:12.645
[Elle] That's not a name.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.614
I like Monika.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.049
"I like Monika."

05:16.115 --> 05:17.583
Quite opinionated, this one, huh?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.553
[Elle] Does she like the name?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.291
I don't know. She's gone.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.561
All right, show me what

05:31.531 --> 05:33.433
Could it be she's a ghost?

05:33.533 --> 05:34.634
Forget about ghosts.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.273
Yeah, she's just a hallucination.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.508
Probably I've been smoking

05:42.608 --> 05:43.676
Mm-hm.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.345
[strums guitar]

05:45.445 --> 05:46.346
Right.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.654
Watch your wrist.

05:54.721 --> 05:55.688
Loosen up.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.028
[they play soft melodic music]

06:15.475 --> 06:17.243
[Monika] Case: Mathew Benvenuti.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.112
Neglecting body hygiene.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.947
Increased feeling

06:30.490 --> 06:33.092
[man] You not only broke my record.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.694
Credit is due.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.867
"Monika." Is that a discrepancy

06:45.271 --> 06:48.007
It is forbidden to read

06:48.074 --> 06:50.042
If you don't pay attention

06:50.109 --> 06:52.111
they swiftly land with

06:55.515 --> 06:57.450
[distant klaxon sounds]

07:25.845 --> 07:27.313
[soft guitar music]

07:27.413 --> 07:29.482
[Mat's sister] Hey, uh,

07:32.151 --> 07:33.653
Oh, "Blue Monday?"

07:45.465 --> 07:48.801
You wrote that in high school.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.871
Kerri.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.307
- Kerri...

07:54.407 --> 07:57.910
- Yeah, she was pretty... hot.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.512
[both laugh]

07:59.612 --> 08:00.713
- Yeah.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.014
- She was.

08:03.683 --> 08:04.584
Hmm...

08:05.518 --> 08:06.719
You missing the band?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.126
It was the right decision...

08:15.127 --> 08:16.596
leaving the band.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.331
You know that, right?

08:21.534 --> 08:23.436
[he continues strumming]

08:29.175 --> 08:31.544
You just have to find

08:31.644 --> 08:33.513
- And that's not that...

08:35.414 --> 08:37.950
Do I need a reason to talk

08:38.050 --> 08:39.118
- Pippa...

08:39.986 --> 08:42.388
[inhales] Could you please wear

08:43.122 --> 08:44.757
when you're walking

08:45.424 --> 08:47.994
close the door when you're using

08:48.094 --> 08:51.364
do your own laundry, maybe

08:52.164 --> 08:53.733
every once in a while and...

08:54.534 --> 08:56.569
Take a shower, Mat.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.475
And please, make an effort...

09:02.575 --> 09:04.844
[chuckles] Yeah.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.446
Impressive how you make her grovel

09:08.314 --> 09:11.450
You know, Elle is so happy

09:11.517 --> 09:14.487
- and I would really want...

09:14.554 --> 09:15.888
- Thanks.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.926
- Are you okay?

09:19.992 --> 09:21.961
She's such a kind-hearted person.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.629
Are you sure?

09:23.729 --> 09:26.399
Even though you asked Astrid

09:26.465 --> 09:28.167
- being the better Benvenuti.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.306
Thanks for Elle. She's super excited

09:33.406 --> 09:34.907
Well, she's a cool kid.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.242
Actually, she's pretty fresh.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.148
You know for sure that you won't

09:42.248 --> 09:43.349
That's nothing new.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.985
No wonder they tossed you

09:46.085 --> 09:47.453
I was the one who left it.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.623
Yes, ever since then, they have

09:50.723 --> 09:54.226
That was your contribution, right?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.795
Once you go, they thrive.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.396
That gives me some hope for Susa.

09:57.997 --> 10:01.167
Were you aware that 4Eternity

10:01.233 --> 10:02.868
in the history of boy groups

10:02.969 --> 10:06.005
who have grown even more successful

10:07.073 --> 10:10.676
Then this brilliant idea to celebrate

10:10.743 --> 10:12.411
Like a sign of quality.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.546
"Minus Mat."

10:13.646 --> 10:14.880
[chuckles]

10:14.947 --> 10:18.117
"Minus Mat" applies equally well

10:18.184 --> 10:21.053
although from a mathematical point

10:21.120 --> 10:23.022
Isn't this already their 11th tour

10:24.023 --> 10:24.957
[Mat sighs]

10:26.092 --> 10:27.526
[phone beeps]

10:28.694 --> 10:30.429
Oh, look there, the 12th after all.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.531
Yeah, crazy, and the new single,

10:32.598 --> 10:34.567
And concerts in... What's it say?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.268
London, Paris, Amsterdam.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.603
And groupies everywhere.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.707
My goodness, they're in great

10:41.807 --> 10:44.043
Almost no fat and lots

10:44.110 --> 10:45.211
[he clears throat]

10:49.248 --> 10:50.149
Where's your jacket?

10:56.589 --> 10:59.291
You wanna pay attention to this

10:59.358 --> 11:02.561
It's not a long-term solution. You

11:02.628 --> 11:04.730
You know what? I can get

11:05.264 --> 11:06.532
No problem.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.535
I don't know. No cash, no status,

11:09.602 --> 11:11.437
And you're still just you.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.672
Wanna bet?

11:14.306 --> 11:16.242
If I win, you get lost.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.745
- You still don't get it, do you?

11:20.546 --> 11:21.480
What?

11:22.214 --> 11:23.716
Forget it. What if I win?

11:23.783 --> 11:26.719
You definitely won't and then

11:28.054 --> 11:29.789
You're just a bad phase.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.993
I will fuck you far away.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.361
Ooh, ooh!

11:39.131 --> 11:42.368
Hey, hey, hey. Four beers?

11:43.135 --> 11:44.437
It's not just for me.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.639
Her name is?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.076
Lisa. Ooh!

11:50.142 --> 11:51.277
Yeah? And?

11:52.678 --> 11:55.748
- Yeah, and I hope to get laid.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.086
Are you conspiring against me?

12:00.152 --> 12:01.787
- With whom?

12:03.289 --> 12:04.523
Who's Monika?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.792
You know what? Forget it.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.230
- You need to deal with your problems.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.734
You're just jealous. Just because

12:14.800 --> 12:17.336
- Yeah, fuck you!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.370
'Cause I'm an Arab.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.573
[chuckles]

12:23.142 --> 12:24.844
That was totally racist.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.746
How can you let him talk

12:26.846 --> 12:28.013
Believe me, it's cool.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.649
I'd give that guy the shirt

12:56.475 --> 13:00.012
90 percent of all women fake

13:00.079 --> 13:01.046
You know that, right?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.953
Especially when they pant

13:08.053 --> 13:09.255
as our good Lisa here.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.390
But luckily, you're used to that.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.693
After all, you do pay for sex.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.828
- Oh, fuck!

13:15.928 --> 13:17.096
What?

13:17.163 --> 13:19.265
Um... where's the toilet?

13:19.365 --> 13:20.432
Left.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.567
Yeah.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.843
Okay, where are you?

13:33.279 --> 13:34.747
I know you can hear me, Monika.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.117
You don't play fair, Monika.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.352
[sighs]

13:40.452 --> 13:41.353
Monika!

13:42.154 --> 13:44.490
[Monika] You can't rub a lamp

13:46.125 --> 13:48.794
I'm not a goddamn genie and you

13:48.894 --> 13:51.030
And my identification number

13:51.130 --> 13:52.731
Okay, whatever, Monika.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.634
I said I would get laid tonight

13:55.734 --> 13:56.635
And you know it.

13:57.436 --> 14:00.206
You're cheating. You're trying

14:00.272 --> 14:01.640
Come out right now, you pig!

14:01.707 --> 14:02.641
Oh, fuck.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.444
I'm not sure I got that.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.746
- Uh, I'm coming in a sec!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.014
[sighs]

14:10.449 --> 14:13.319
Hey, asshole, no idea what kind

14:13.385 --> 14:15.454
but I will definitely not let you

14:15.521 --> 14:17.790
just because you were

14:17.890 --> 14:19.625
Oh, God, sorry. [chuckles]

14:19.725 --> 14:21.493
I didn't want you to hear all that.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.231
[sighs] But that was for a role.

14:26.932 --> 14:27.967
What kind of role?

14:28.667 --> 14:31.637
Well, I can't really talk about it,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.875
You know, you just inspire me.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.345
- I felt this spark.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.814
I've been out of touch with

14:43.282 --> 14:45.184
but now I could all of a sudden

14:45.284 --> 14:47.319
how my role feels and what

14:48.587 --> 14:50.623
I'm sorry. Really, I'm...

14:53.592 --> 14:55.094
[Lisa sighs and moans]

14:58.664 --> 14:59.932
[giggles]

15:05.237 --> 15:07.106
[both moaning with pleasure]

15:14.046 --> 15:16.782
I have to say, I'm quite taken

15:17.383 --> 15:19.251
Manipulating this woman

15:19.318 --> 15:21.754
simply in order to win a bet

15:21.854 --> 15:23.389
nor fathom why you entered

15:24.123 --> 15:26.492
I mean, it's all the same to you,

15:26.558 --> 15:27.893
I can respect that.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.763
The only thing that I really haven't

15:31.563 --> 15:33.999
Is it your mom or your dad

15:34.066 --> 15:36.602
Oh, fuck! This is not fair

15:36.669 --> 15:39.638
Um, hey, it's really not a problem

15:39.705 --> 15:41.640
I don't have a fucking

15:41.707 --> 15:43.375
That stupid bitch isn't playing fair.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.311
- What do you mean?

15:45.411 --> 15:47.112
Um, is this again for a role?

15:47.212 --> 15:49.081
She probably thinks

15:49.148 --> 15:50.783
- You are crazy, you fucking bitch!

16:00.492 --> 16:01.560
Fuck off!

16:01.627 --> 16:03.495
Yeah, it's not as simple as that.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.665
Okay, can I ask you a question,

16:06.765 --> 16:08.400
- My name is F32...

16:11.303 --> 16:12.771
Why are you doing this to me?

16:13.605 --> 16:14.506
Hmm?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.543
I mean, what is it I have to do

16:20.045 --> 16:21.714
What do you think you have to do?

16:22.548 --> 16:23.482
I don't know.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.451
I think you know.

16:27.519 --> 16:30.155
Okay, I'm just not in the right

16:30.255 --> 16:31.423
so either you tell me, or not.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.733
[scoffs]

16:48.507 --> 16:50.409
[elevator bell rings]

16:50.476 --> 16:51.810
[muttering]

17:00.652 --> 17:05.324
"It is presumed that the name Monika

17:05.391 --> 17:07.526
meaning 'the unique one'

17:08.494 --> 17:09.762
or 'solitary one.'"

17:10.596 --> 17:12.164
- Everything okay?

17:13.265 --> 17:15.834
Everything's great, just fantastic.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.604
He is getting worn down

17:19.571 --> 17:22.307
Next thing to go is the libido

17:24.042 --> 17:24.943
Good.

17:26.045 --> 17:30.482
F32.1-1977/02 has the highest

17:31.917 --> 17:33.285
your reliability.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.954
She trusts you.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.192
I know that.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.129
[sighs]

17:49.768 --> 17:52.404
And please remember to put

17:52.471 --> 17:54.239
back in its place in the library.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.913
[Monika] Distance from the cases

18:08.520 --> 18:10.456
- Fucker!

18:10.522 --> 18:11.690
[Monika] Slander.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.926
- [groaning]

18:13.992 --> 18:15.094
You piece of shit!

18:15.160 --> 18:16.528
[Monika] Desolation.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.366
Sweating, suicidal thoughts,

18:21.433 --> 18:23.769
dreams, memory loss and

18:39.785 --> 18:40.719
Syphilis?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.955
Nabil, are you sure?

18:43.055 --> 18:44.890
Yeah, JJ told me about it.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.393
And he, uh... He said that I should

18:49.194 --> 18:51.029
But, um, you didn't have a thing

18:51.563 --> 18:54.933
- How do you know you have syphilis?

18:56.068 --> 18:57.636
While you were together with Susa?

18:58.504 --> 19:01.406
You know, that's what comes from

19:01.473 --> 19:02.841
"A painful scrotum..."

19:02.908 --> 19:05.010
- Dude, why Lola?

19:05.077 --> 19:08.013
- She's absolutely not your type.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.550
- What?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.153
Are you sure?

19:14.753 --> 19:15.687
Yeah, I guess.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.791
- I've got to see a doctor.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.962
Thank you. You can pull up

19:24.029 --> 19:24.963
Yeah.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.401
[Mat clears throat]

19:30.569 --> 19:32.104
What makes you think

19:33.438 --> 19:37.476
Well... there's this woman

19:37.543 --> 19:39.678
I mean, what symptoms did you say

19:39.745 --> 19:40.679
Well...

19:41.747 --> 19:44.483
Itching on my balls and, um...

19:46.385 --> 19:48.253
I have difficulties staying hard.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.790
Fever, swollen lymph nodes?

19:52.991 --> 19:53.926
No.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.228
But...

20:00.199 --> 20:01.833
I have hallucinations.

20:04.236 --> 20:07.839
It's a woman and only I can see

20:08.440 --> 20:09.374
Uh-huh.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.710
What does she say?

20:12.544 --> 20:15.113
She puts me down all day long,

20:15.914 --> 20:18.917
She's constantly mocking my penis

20:18.984 --> 20:21.720
Okay, and, uh, how is your mood

20:21.787 --> 20:23.689
Have you been tired recently,

20:23.755 --> 20:26.191
Do you sleep a lot or are you

20:29.494 --> 20:31.463
Yeah, like, I guess.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.865
Have you been pulling away

20:33.966 --> 20:36.168
What? Is that a symptom

20:36.235 --> 20:39.071
No, but none of your symptoms are.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.507
Hallucinations first appear if,

20:42.608 --> 20:44.810
You would've already been

20:44.876 --> 20:46.745
and you would know

20:46.845 --> 20:47.746
Hmm.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.148
I'm not a therapist,

20:50.249 --> 20:53.986
but, to me, it sounds very much

20:54.086 --> 20:55.487
- What?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.456
It could also come from

20:57.522 --> 20:59.524
Could you get a bit more precise,

20:59.591 --> 21:01.293
...but I'm leaning toward depression.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.762
- Bing! Bing! Bing!

21:04.396 --> 21:05.597
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.134
You know what? This is bullshit.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.870
You suck. Big time!

21:12.504 --> 21:14.840
I will give zero points

21:15.707 --> 21:18.610
And you, you're not a depression,

21:18.677 --> 21:19.811
[clatter]

21:26.151 --> 21:27.352
[door slams]

21:28.887 --> 21:31.490
[Mat on video] La-la-la-la-la!

21:31.556 --> 21:34.926
You know what? I can't hear you.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.728
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.864
You know what? I can't hear you

21:38.964 --> 21:41.633
You're absolutely not here.

21:41.733 --> 21:42.634
And you are...

21:43.335 --> 21:46.171
Why don't you leave me alone?

21:46.838 --> 21:47.873
Hi, Mat.

21:49.841 --> 21:50.742
Hi.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.812
[Mat shouting angrily on video]

21:53.879 --> 21:55.047
Fuck you!

22:00.052 --> 22:01.286
She isn't here now, is she?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.323
No.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.326
Are you writing a new song?

22:08.560 --> 22:10.329
Um... no.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.331
[Elle] Too bad.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.102
Mat... [sighs]

22:18.603 --> 22:19.905
I have a question for you.

22:21.306 --> 22:22.240
What?

22:23.208 --> 22:24.876
[she sighs]

22:24.943 --> 22:26.678
Why does Mom hate you so much?

22:26.745 --> 22:29.314
I could come up with a hundred

22:35.320 --> 22:36.254
Hi, Monika.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.490
Hmm?

22:40.692 --> 22:41.993
[Elle sighs]

22:42.094 --> 22:43.595
I don't know if you can hear me,

22:43.695 --> 22:45.263
but can't you just leave Mat

22:46.431 --> 22:48.533
You know, can't you see

22:51.603 --> 22:54.639
Maybe you should be talking

22:54.706 --> 22:56.074
Maybe a doctor?

22:56.174 --> 22:57.642
[chuckles softly]

22:57.709 --> 23:01.413
I'm afraid that she's... going to

23:01.480 --> 23:02.714
and Mom will kick you out.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.119
[Mat sighs]

23:07.986 --> 23:08.920
Come here.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.963
I promise you I will deal

23:24.970 --> 23:27.706
[Monika] Distance from the cases

23:27.806 --> 23:29.574
Deviations have to be filed

23:30.976 --> 23:32.344
[distant chatter]

23:34.880 --> 23:37.149
Most astounding seeing the paths

23:37.249 --> 23:39.151
until the cases ask for help,

23:39.251 --> 23:40.452
Ah, so, yeah. I know.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.154
- Yeah.

23:44.489 --> 23:46.024
- That's not mine.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.692
I saw how it fell out

23:49.127 --> 23:50.996
No, really, I've never seen it

23:53.398 --> 23:55.000
Believe me, you're not alone.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.479
[Monika] Room 206. Archive.
