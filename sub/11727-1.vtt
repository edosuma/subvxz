00:52.971 --> 00:54.667
Our mission is to seek and destroy.

Our enemies are not.

00:59.129 --> 01:04.205
Lethal weapons are ours.

01:05.322 --> 01:08.763
They have knowledge of
soft targets in the

01:08.764 --> 01:12.203
basement and that makes
them difficult to destroy.

01:13.533 --> 01:17.008
We are allowed to shoot our goal.

01:18.613 --> 01:22.647

Well, do it fast.

08:37.381 --> 08:38.841
Sorry, big guy.

09:40.356 --> 09:41.525

Come for a little bitch.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.123

Quick, hurry!

12:02.519 --> 12:03.729
They were.

12:06.416 --> 12:07.555
They shot the door, Billy.

12:07.599 --> 12:09.222
What the hell?

12:15.219 --> 12:16.500
What the hell are you doing?

12:19.149 --> 12:20.502
Oh shit.

12:20.542 --> 12:24.089
Shot?
Yes, there are thugs out.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.115
They have weapons

12:27.153 --> 12:29.133
Shut up 'You shut up.

12:35.329 --> 12:36.433

Do not you hear me?

12:46.706 --> 12:49.172
Hey, hey.

12:53.491 --> 12:54.629

12:59.544 --> 13:04.195
You do not know you, but relax.

13:05.633 --> 13:09.595
All relax
I can not, I'm claustrophobic.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.816
And why did you come?
...Do not be stupid.

13:11.861 --> 13:13.771
Come.

13:18.053 --> 13:20.627
Help, Help!
...Closed doors!

13:23.065 --> 13:26.778
Guys, the music stopped, the
party ended, No one comes to us.

13:28.177 --> 13:32.520
How we get out?

13:34.372 --> 13:40.456
It is made of concrete... and metal

13:40.529 --> 13:42.333
shit.

13:44.287 --> 13:46.470
It is an industrial cave.

13:46.515 --> 13:50.404
Typical underground U.S. military.

13:51.593 --> 13:56.150
All these places are the same.

13:57.612 --> 14:02.893
Have drivers, radiators,
a second exhaust port

14:02.937 --> 14:08.535
and those fans used to escape.

14:08.572 --> 14:12.463
If I get a radiator,
I can recharge my cell.

14:12.505 --> 14:15.078
How are you going to have
an underground service?

14:15.114 --> 14:18.233
Well, where is the second exit, genius?

14:29.101 --> 14:31.177
There's something wrong with this place.

14:35.815 --> 14:39.456
'This way there should be a door
'Sorry, I will not go more.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.377
The exit is over there.

14:41.416 --> 14:44.121
It is the only path to an exit.

14:59.196 --> 15:06.196
Preserve light, with cell phones and
the glosticks when necessary.

15:11.965 --> 15:13.174
We must leave here.

15:34.719 --> 15:35.656
Idiot!

15:35.694 --> 15:37.946
Do not make jokes, Storm.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.470
Storm, come here

15:45.506 --> 15:47.830
Eric, turns on the light.

15:51.245 --> 15:53.083
Shit...
...What is it?

15:53.124 --> 15:57.987
Here are gas lamps,
used it in an emergency.

16:04.432 --> 16:06.578
Pull this 'All right, boss.

16:14.731 --> 16:16.675
Oh god, I could kiss!

16:18.175 --> 16:21.236
Do not get excited, do not
know how much gas has.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.092
You're right, let's use this light,
let's go.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.701
Come on, move!

16:38.424 --> 16:40.297
Left.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.070
What the hell was that?
Oh my god.

16:55.646 --> 16:57.414
Hurry
...I will not go over there.

16:57.456 --> 16:59.709
Can be stopped?

16:59.752 --> 17:04.545
They think they have a GPS?
That is the wrong way.

17:05.701 --> 17:07.469
Let's face.

17:10.015 --> 17:17.015
Relax, this place is easy to confuse.

17:17.425 --> 17:20.936
No big deal, is what is happening now.

17:23.968 --> 17:27.680
The second output should
be opposite to the first.

17:29.047 --> 17:32.203
We are still at the first exit,
come on, think a little.

17:33.606 --> 17:35.752
Come, come.

17:38.232 --> 17:41.187
Why did I come?
It's your fault!

17:41.225 --> 17:43.621
Shut up!
We are going to die!

17:43.661 --> 17:48.523
They shut up and walk.

18:05.509 --> 18:08.665
My God... This leads to
another level, the only way out.

18:08.711 --> 18:12.875
We will divide into 2 groups
takes the girls with you, Billy

18:12.921 --> 18:15.553
I'll be behind you, quiet

18:18.731 --> 18:22.172
I do not know how safe they are,
we should not use together.

19:05.213 --> 19:08.962
It's just down ..
Everything all right?

19:09.006 --> 19:13.728
Let us find the damn exit.

19:18.818 --> 19:20.621
That is disgusting.

19:50.374 --> 19:53.400
Great, no output.

19:56.707 --> 19:58.296
Check this out.

20:00.812 --> 20:02.129
What is it?

20:06.067 --> 20:07.620
One type of tunnel

20:12.156 --> 20:13.708
I will review

20:29.447 --> 20:30.763
I saw something, I swear to God

20:30.803 --> 20:32.856
I saw eyes.

20:32.892 --> 20:34.835
You say that there is something there?
Yes.

20:34.874 --> 20:37.935
What could have down here?
...Hey!

20:46.322 --> 20:49.418
What do you do with scare?
...I just saw your eyes, man.

20:50.914 --> 20:53.130
Lie, go see it again.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.671
Yes, nothing.

21:34.996 --> 21:36.941
It must be reflective, I was wrong

21:39.554 --> 21:45.983
I saw that there is a way, maybe if we,
we reach the second level

21:46.025 --> 21:49.774
I will not go there
...We also.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.009
Look for a door.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.595
There.

22:07.632 --> 22:11.974
If someone wants to do it, do it now
'That will be me.

22:16.921 --> 22:19.139
Meanwhile, go over there

22:25.932 --> 22:28.400
I have very thirsty Yes, I also.

22:42.284 --> 22:43.743
What, what was that?

22:43.781 --> 22:45.781
Only the tubes.

22:56.236 --> 22:58.420
Is glass?

23:02.394 --> 23:04.721
For what?

23:07.474 --> 23:08.862
Give me the pole.

23:17.739 --> 23:20.444
Sounds like a old aquarium
I can not see anything.

23:24.802 --> 23:28.276
And they are in a contest to urinate?
Why is taking so long?

23:32.455 --> 23:33.808
We.

23:34.822 --> 23:38.820
Hey, you can take water
from the urinary.

23:40.459 --> 23:43.720
You are sick.
Have fun.

24:03.630 --> 24:04.531
What the fuck!

24:27.324 --> 24:28.984
My God, my God!

24:29.029 --> 24:32.326
What the hell happened?

24:32.368 --> 24:35.144
We do not know, do not know!

24:35.187 --> 24:37.240
Jenna!

24:41.970 --> 24:45.375
Just steer clear, okay?

24:45.416 --> 24:48.121
Is breathing.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.402
You'll be fine.

24:56.445 --> 24:59.542
There's nothing there Click, right?

24:59.577 --> 25:02.114
Jenna, Evie!

25:02.151 --> 25:05.935
Where were they?
I do not know, but we must leave here.

25:19.235 --> 25:23.268
Not far from us We are going to die.

25:37.778 --> 25:40.968
It's going to survive?
Yes, still breathing.

25:41.014 --> 25:43.825
And if we find a way out...

25:51.034 --> 25:54.961
We can not take it, we will stop,
need speed

25:56.358 --> 25:58.790
I think it'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

25:58.828 --> 26:01.188
Both must be calm.

26:02.656 --> 26:06.583
Yes, listen to Dr. He did not even
know what it was that attacked him.

26:06.622 --> 26:11.556
These gang... did
They?

26:11.597 --> 26:13.649
You think they were?

26:13.684 --> 26:15.938
Eric, not.

26:16.781 --> 26:19.380
Come a time.

26:25.341 --> 26:27.914
We have to think a strategy now.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.804
'We have to be quiet
How are we to do?

26:31.846 --> 26:35.286
- Because we're going to die!
- Shut up, shut up!

26:35.326 --> 26:37.165
Shut all.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.004
We need help now or
will bleed to death.

26:40.997 --> 26:44.437
We have to divide us.
Someone must stay with him

26:44.476 --> 26:47.631
I'll go with you.

26:52.443 --> 26:54.910
'All right, all right According

26:56.236 --> 27:00.469
God is vomiting blood!

27:17.494 --> 27:22.050
Where are we going?
What the hell was that?

27:47.312 --> 27:48.284
Let's go.

27:54.096 --> 27:56.457
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

28:07.317 --> 28:09.914
See that? It was not human!
'I do not know!

28:11.492 --> 28:15.098
Who did you think human?

28:15.146 --> 28:18.964
I have seen so many bodies in Iraq.

28:21.861 --> 28:24.186
By bombs, but no hands!

28:26.976 --> 28:29.477
Pick it up, do it.

28:31.324 --> 28:33.340
You can do
...No, I can!

28:34.386 --> 28:36.386
Okay, okay.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.378
Okay, okay.

28:50.947 --> 28:53.023
We're not alone 'I know.

28:53.070 --> 28:56.368
No, look at that.

28:56.410 --> 28:59.220
What do they do?

28:59.262 --> 29:01.030
Without departing from the group.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.496
What the hell is that?

29:18.711 --> 29:20.099
Definitely not human.

29:22.330 --> 29:24.382
We do not know how much
gas is in the generators.

29:24.383 --> 29:26.434
We have to keep moving.

29:26.471 --> 29:31.121
The more we know what it is,
better to fight them.

29:34.265 --> 29:38.570
He's dead, whatever it is,
That is not breathing.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.414
This is not something
you've seen before.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.598
You can not break the glass, go, go!

30:47.225 --> 30:51.222
What the hell is it?
...No time to find out! Come on!

31:13.736 --> 31:16.477
We can still way out hajar.

31:39.552 --> 31:41.046
It is clear.

31:41.082 --> 31:44.688
'It's a good place to hide
'Come, come.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.096
Come on!

31:49.016 --> 31:52.943
Look what is necessary for
use as weapons, whatever.

31:52.983 --> 31:57.216
They must do whatever
is necessary to defend.

31:59.001 --> 32:01.812
Whatever you have to do, they will.

32:14.728 --> 32:18.891
Water, food, whatever they are.

32:18.972 --> 32:21.404
Are we ready?
Go!

32:55.157 --> 32:58.703
The generators ran out of gas,
Eric catches that

32:58.740 --> 33:00.852
I can not see anything.

33:00.896 --> 33:04.123
The light works?

33:27.234 --> 33:28.789
Are upon us.

33:28.836 --> 33:33.557
Quick!

33:33.602 --> 33:36.377
Shit!

34:00.706 --> 34:03.968
I'm coming!

34:59.991 --> 35:01.237
Calm down.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.162
It is not.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.073
Silence.

35:26.399 --> 35:28.308
You should not have come for me.

35:28.347 --> 35:31.504
We are one, remember?

35:31.549 --> 35:33.388
You out of here.

37:04.653 --> 37:06.385
Let's see if it works.

37:10.638 --> 37:17.638
What we are fighting are not human,
are much more lethal than we.

37:18.014 --> 37:21.454
You can shoot and destroy the enemy.

37:22.851 --> 37:27.856
The military were here.

37:32.976 --> 37:34.433
They can not stop.

37:34.470 --> 37:37.566
They tried but failed.

37:49.606 --> 37:50.542
We.

37:54.407 --> 37:56.626
Take this

38:13.925 --> 38:16.736
I do not know why they did,
but must have a reason.

38:16.778 --> 38:19.140
It makes no sense.

38:35.288 --> 38:37.921
It will not return, is dead.

38:37.968 --> 38:40.293
We do not know that.

38:40.334 --> 38:42.695
Do not leave.

38:48.962 --> 38:50.100
What is it?

39:39.551 --> 39:40.559
It is clear.

39:42.611 --> 39:47.060
- How bad is it? We will stop?
- No, not, give me a hand Eric

39:48.875 --> 39:50.049
1, 2, 3

39:53.711 --> 39:56.344
It is not so serious, will
be fine in a few minutes.

39:57.504 --> 40:00.321
We can not fight these
things if we are dragging.

40:00.322 --> 40:03.138
Sorry, it's tough, but
not die for that.

40:04.497 --> 40:08.697
Shut up... How often will tell
you that we will not stop anyone?

40:27.808 --> 40:28.744
Friend.

40:33.444 --> 40:34.416
Yes?

40:34.453 --> 40:39.316
Will not let you 'You saw what
he did to Evie? The split in two.

40:41.656 --> 40:45.024
These things... are not animals.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.282
What you say?

40:49.901 --> 40:55.630
I saw a recording of the soldiers,
Special Forces Unit came to destroy

40:57.520 --> 41:00.819
these things killed the unit.

41:00.862 --> 41:05.831
They were organized in piles,
clothes, necklaces, bones, weapons.

41:05.870 --> 41:08.575
They have more intelligence
than an animal.

41:08.619 --> 41:10.422
How to kill them?

41:11.958 --> 41:14.806
If you are alive, may die

41:35.444 --> 41:37.592
Eric, come, we belong together.

41:37.637 --> 41:43.437
Think I do not know where we are?
They are everywhere.

41:44.595 --> 41:47.264
When no noise, do not come.

41:47.309 --> 41:49.634
We kill one by one.

41:52.318 --> 41:54.300
We have to cross this.

41:54.371 --> 41:55.794
Come.

42:13.194 --> 42:14.891
What place is this?

42:14.933 --> 42:19.347
Panels are.

42:20.293 --> 42:22.368
In what is floating?

42:22.414 --> 42:27.243
The temperature changes.

42:52.475 --> 42:54.242
How deep is it?

42:55.607 --> 42:56.923
Hard to say.

42:56.964 --> 43:01.934
Not cross it, those damn in the water.

43:01.973 --> 43:05.651
We have no choice.

43:10.012 --> 43:13.487
'I do not listen? No it will cross
These stay.

43:13.525 --> 43:16.443
Dies
...Jenna, please.

43:19.857 --> 43:21.694
Hurry 'OK, go, go

43:33.113 --> 43:35.165
Eric, come, do not stay.

43:37.532 --> 43:39.644
Water
...Eric!

43:39.689 --> 43:45.561
What?... These waters are toxic,
these creatures are amphibians.

43:45.604 --> 43:49.009
'Be careful He's right.

46:00.668 --> 46:02.850
Were carried Eric.

46:18.274 --> 46:19.862
There was nothing you could do.

46:28.573 --> 46:29.995
What happened in your chest?

46:33.442 --> 46:35.388
Max told me, tell.

46:38.489 --> 46:45.489
We came from the mission ..
We were at the base

46:48.404 --> 46:50.384
Iraqi police was behind us

46:52.718 --> 46:55.291
and we all jumped up and shot them

46:58.736 --> 47:02.699
and saw two approaching

47:06.635 --> 47:11.356
Matt told me not to shoot, but
I did not hear

47:12.723 --> 47:13.755
shot

47:15.229 --> 47:16.474
and fired

47:18.985 --> 47:20.646
and children were

47:21.978 --> 47:24.552
sent children behind us

47:30.154 --> 47:31.578
and killed.

47:36.105 --> 47:39.438
We threw grenades

47:41.498 --> 47:43.787
Matty took me to a safe place.

47:47.100 --> 47:48.687
He took the shot.

48:05.956 --> 48:07.546
It's my guardian angel.

48:25.126 --> 48:27.274
We must focus.

48:28.918 --> 48:31.101
Come on, we have to concentrate.

48:48.507 --> 48:49.717
We got company!

49:10.602 --> 49:12.298
Looking for a generator.

50:27.666 --> 50:29.161
Okay, soldier.

50:34.416 --> 50:36.006
Look at this

51:08.861 --> 51:15.019
I created a creature face

51:15.054 --> 51:18.637
that can replace soldiers

51:20.168 --> 51:27.168
these creatures are made for
the French Navy and American

51:29.840 --> 51:36.792
American prototypes.

51:36.834 --> 51:43.834
Soldiers
...Using a radical form of genetic

51:43.967 --> 51:50.967
animal and human

51:55.830 --> 52:02.830
with a high mortality rate, we created
these creatures of human mothers.

52:11.905 --> 52:17.599
Women have obtained.

52:17.646 --> 52:21.146
Feeding with blood, I
got that creatures

52:21.147 --> 52:24.646
survive in the womb of
their human mothers

52:36.538 --> 52:43.538
to create a new species.

52:47.428 --> 52:52.779
Our older generations
were more primitive

52:54.039 --> 53:01.039
but the following may be transmitted.

53:04.130 --> 53:11.130
You can call them as they
want but I call them Frogs.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.270
They think like soldiers.

53:25.839 --> 53:27.678
That's why you kept alive.

53:27.718 --> 53:29.971
To use you as an incubator.

53:32.485 --> 53:33.315
Yes?

53:34.225 --> 53:38.780
The army teaches us to kill and create
these things for the same purpose.

53:39.826 --> 53:41.416
Now they want to kill?

53:41.462 --> 53:44.760
Someone left this plan.

53:44.802 --> 53:50.531
Do you mean?... That whatever it is,
we can not tell anyone that went down.

53:50.577 --> 53:54.053
That's right, the military
will not let us tell.

53:54.091 --> 53:58.018
If we talk, we will disappear.

53:58.056 --> 54:00.631
If we fall, we die
and if we, we die also.

54:00.667 --> 54:05.115
No, when we leave,
we will stay silent.

54:07.313 --> 54:10.433
If you are part animal, what they fear
Most animals?

54:12.149 --> 54:17.155
Fire? 'Exactly, if we adecuandos
chemicals, we can overcome

54:20.638 --> 54:22.370
I agree, better to try.

54:22.412 --> 54:24.358
Doctor.

54:38.834 --> 54:39.902
Bingo.

54:49.342 --> 54:50.837
Check this out.

54:50.873 --> 54:54.870
If you could ignite the whole place.

54:54.907 --> 55:00.259
If we unite, we can overcome.

55:00.302 --> 55:02.769
Do not want to fight in groups.

55:02.806 --> 55:04.501
Shit.

55:41.531 --> 55:42.955
Come back, come!

55:56.387 --> 55:57.394
Jenna!

57:00.335 --> 57:02.448
You should be here.

57:12.619 --> 57:15.120
Please, please help.

57:21.177 --> 57:22.493
Help us out.

57:25.630 --> 57:28.964
Once you enter, do not go.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.388
Mat!

57:41.460 --> 57:43.333
I'm here!

57:47.967 --> 57:49.282
I'm down here!

57:57.883 --> 58:04.883
To make my creatures, deadly
I found the best way to create.

58:14.269 --> 58:21.187
My drugs make them better

58:21.229 --> 58:25.747
but makes a bit angry.

58:25.786 --> 58:28.384
What say?

58:28.430 --> 58:35.239
My drug test No, do not wanna die.

58:35.285 --> 58:40.327
No, no, no others!

58:40.364 --> 58:43.033
I can save.

58:43.078 --> 58:46.340
Yes, I know.

58:46.383 --> 58:51.284
- What is your name?
- Jenna.

58:51.325 --> 58:55.950
Thank you, thank you very much.

58:55.986 --> 59:02.071
Come, come, come.

59:05.554 --> 59:10.110
Your eyes are beautiful.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.492
Come, come here.

59:30.536 --> 59:34.699
Let me take.

01:00:48.401 --> 01:00:51.662
Are you okay?

01:01:01.239 --> 01:01:04.608
Stay close.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:19.886
Shit!

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.719
Are you okay?

01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:28.027
Just a scratch.

01:01:29.282 --> 01:01:30.704
Where is Jenna?

01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:33.626
I do not know brother.

01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:53.841
Should not enter.

01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:58.015
Believe me, no return.

01:01:59.622 --> 01:02:04.140
Neither your friend Jenna.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.255
Fuck you, man!

01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:10.465
Typical American.

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:17.511
You're a damned fool,
left you here alone like a rat.

01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:21.771
No, I'm left here with my
project, to create more

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:25.271
for thewar I will save
many lives and the glory.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.940
At what price?

01:02:42.207 --> 01:02:45.541
Collateral Damage.

01:03:24.411 --> 01:03:25.941
Come on, come on!

01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:33.628
I think we lost.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.998
We're going down that
road and then down.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.879
A taste.

01:04:48.123 --> 01:04:48.880
Shit.

01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:51.650
Mat?

01:06:21.504 --> 01:06:22.370
Mat!

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.111
Mat?

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:34.166
Look at me!

01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:47.620
I!

01:06:59.742 --> 01:07:00.714
Sorry.

01:07:59.307 --> 01:08:00.315
Look up.

01:08:41.928 --> 01:08:43.207
Come on, damn!

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.471
It is dead quiet, dead!

01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:08.013
We.

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:15.154
Storm!

01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:28.756
Hello.

01:09:35.057 --> 01:09:37.238
Well, team.

01:09:42.085 --> 01:09:43.814
Put your arm around my neck,
will carry you.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:49.413
No, come on, man...

01:09:49.495 --> 01:09:52.307
Look.

01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:59.349
We have seen men like that, not
even that bad, and did not make it.

01:10:00.907 --> 01:10:03.409
They broke my stomach,
I'm not going anywhere.

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.031
They have to fight.

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:13.355
Well done.

01:10:14.755 --> 01:10:15.857
Very well.

01:10:17.538 --> 01:10:23.518
This is what I deserve for
killing those children

01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:25.668
I feel so bad about it
...Not.

01:10:25.714 --> 01:10:27.659
Do not do that.

01:10:30.064 --> 01:10:37.064
Listen to me, okay? You out of
here and take you to a hospital

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.951
I'm not going to be OK, Matty

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:50.554
I can load on your neck.

01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:53.747
Those things will kill you,
I will only waste your time

01:10:56.645 --> 01:10:58.175
I can not leave.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:03.453
Will not live long.

01:11:03.499 --> 01:11:06.654
You heard what he said?

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.256
He said he will not live long.

01:11:22.913 --> 01:11:25.759
Clava something in my chest now
you hear me?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.913
Now, Matty.

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.648
Do not leave me this way

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:43.361
I love you, brother

01:11:45.354 --> 01:11:46.778
I really do.

01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:53.815
Look, this fucking cares for me
Do you agree?

01:12:03.935 --> 01:12:08.620
Well, that's a thank

01:12:14.059 --> 01:12:17.533
I can not believe you got back.

01:12:20.773 --> 01:12:22.647
Semper Fi.

01:12:24.878 --> 01:12:27.417
Do it now, damn.

01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:53.855
Curse.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.662
Time to go.

01:13:37.699 --> 01:13:40.819
It's time to go home.

01:13:55.618 --> 01:13:58.192
The missing girl's name
is Evie, her parents

01:13:58.193 --> 01:14:00.766
say who went to a rave
at the military base

01:14:00.801 --> 01:14:03.269
would be good to go there and check

01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:11.831
I have fear.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:18.189
Hey.

01:14:18.233 --> 01:14:20.806
We leave here.

01:15:27.018 --> 01:15:28.334
No way out, we.

01:16:31.316 --> 01:16:32.382
What the hell happened?

01:16:35.455 --> 01:16:38.231
They are alone?
Where is Evie?

01:16:47.076 --> 01:16:51.561
Sheriff, Sheriff, now!
No!

01:17:15.675 --> 01:17:16.920
No!

01:18:06.403 --> 01:18:07.203
We did.

01:18:36.429 --> 01:18:39.276
How can we continue?

01:18:43.282 --> 01:18:44.350
Do not know

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.615
I guess we have to.

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.957
And learn to put it in the past.

01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:57.712
Try

01:19:12.752 --> 01:19:15.255
I feel so guilty

01:19:17.518 --> 01:19:18.942
I will miss him

01:19:24.372 --> 01:19:26.698
I love you And I love you.

01:21:00.365 --> 01:21:01.266
What is it?

01:21:01.305 --> 01:21:04.567
I can not get out of my head.

01:21:08.508 --> 01:21:10.796
Okay, it's just a nightmare.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.110
You're safe, right?

01:21:15.187 --> 01:21:18.521
You're safe.

01:21:32.584 --> 01:21:33.900
Okay.

01:22:16.701 --> 01:22:17.638
Mat.

01:22:20.423 --> 01:22:21.395
Who was it?

01:22:21.432 --> 01:22:26.058
Mat?

01:22:33.853 --> 01:22:36.214
Get away from me!
