00:57.289 --> 01:01.059
Ma, what's taking daddy so long?
I'm freezing.

01:01.127 --> 01:05.296
Archie, did you fix
the furnace yet?

01:05.364 --> 01:07.732
<i>[ Clattering ]</i>
<i>[ Archie ]</i>
<i>Long ago, Edith.</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:11.803
<i>But I'm staying down here</i>
<i>because I love the cellar.</i>

01:13.072 --> 01:16.407
Oh, I see.
<i>Dingbat.</i>

01:16.475 --> 01:19.044
Gloria, pass the toast.
Here.

01:19.111 --> 01:23.347
Have some more coffee.
It'll take the chill
off your bones.

01:23.415 --> 01:27.852
Thanks, ma. Why does the furnace
only break down on Sundays?

01:27.920 --> 01:31.890
Your father made up
a joke about that.

01:31.957 --> 01:34.592
He said, "we got
a religious oil burner.

01:34.660 --> 01:39.564
It never works on Sunday."
[ Laughing ]

01:42.868 --> 01:48.239
When your father told me,
I thought I'd never stop
laughing.

01:49.374 --> 01:52.410
Well, I think I got
the damn thing fixed.

01:52.477 --> 01:55.580
We should have some heat
up here in a few minutes.
Oh, good.

01:55.647 --> 01:58.282
Yeah, but a funny thing hit
me when I was down there.

01:58.350 --> 02:02.220
[ Laughs ]
We got a religious
oil burner.

02:02.287 --> 02:06.424
It don't work Sundays.
[ Laughing ]

02:10.895 --> 02:14.432
I just told them
that joke, Archie.

02:14.499 --> 02:17.168
Oh, thank you.
<i>[ Doorbell buzzes ]</i>

02:17.236 --> 02:19.170
I'll get it.

02:19.238 --> 02:21.472
Wait a minute.
Hold your horses
there, meathead.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.209
Don't be grabbin' seconds
till other people
get firsts.

02:24.276 --> 02:28.012
- <i>[ Edith ] Who was that?</i>
<i>- Someone delivering</i>
<i> these leaflets.</i>

02:28.080 --> 02:30.448
Oh. What does it say?

02:30.515 --> 02:33.651
It says, "would you like
to sell your house?

02:33.719 --> 02:36.788
"The Chester byrd
real estate agency
is prepared to offer you...

02:36.856 --> 02:40.458
"A substantial profit
on your original purchase
price if you'll act now.

02:40.525 --> 02:43.628
If interested,
call Mr. byrd at 877--"

02:43.695 --> 02:46.430
let me see that there
leaflet. "Chester byrd--"

02:46.498 --> 02:51.435
"substantial profit." They got
them words underlined here.

02:51.503 --> 02:54.139
Hey, who would want to pay
a lot of money for this house?

02:54.206 --> 02:58.042
Are you kiddin'?
They don't build homes
like this nowadays.

02:58.110 --> 03:02.013
This house is constructed
way better than the new ones
you see around today.

03:02.081 --> 03:05.416
So are the pyramids,
but who'd want to live there?

03:11.056 --> 03:14.725
You would if they'd
let you in for nothin'.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.728
Daddy, you still haven't
answered Michael's question:

03:17.797 --> 03:19.864
Who would want
to buy this house?

03:19.932 --> 03:23.168
Lots of people,
little girl.
Oh, I don't know, Archie.

03:23.235 --> 03:25.736
Oh, all right, Edith.
I ain't sayin' everybody.

03:25.805 --> 03:29.140
After all, one man's goose
is another man's gander.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.343
All I'm saying is...

03:32.411 --> 03:36.047
That somewhere
there's a man for who
this house is perfect.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.983
What if he lives in Japan?

03:40.886 --> 03:44.222
Then he loses out, Edith.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.892
But, daddy, why would you
want to sell? Your mortgage
is almost paid up.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.894
Yeah. It doesn't
make any sense.

03:49.962 --> 03:52.163
Certainly it makes sense.

03:52.231 --> 03:56.234
I bought this house
20 years ago for $14,000.

03:56.302 --> 04:01.172
The way prices are goin' up,
maybe I could turn it over today
for 21,000, maybe 22.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.275
Yeah, but, Archie,
wherever you move in New York
is gonna cost you that much.

04:04.343 --> 04:08.346
So who says we gotta live
in New York? Maybe we could live
someplace cheaper, cost less.

04:08.413 --> 04:11.549
Like where?
Oh, use your imagination,
will ya?

04:11.616 --> 04:14.185
There's plenty of places.
Out west, for example.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.420
You got a little elbow room
out there.

04:16.488 --> 04:20.458
A man can move along
the mountaintops without
people pushin' and shovin'.

04:20.524 --> 04:24.329
Where you don't seldom hear
no discouraging word.

04:24.396 --> 04:28.233
He means California.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.402
That's right, California.
Hey, Edith, just
for the fun of it,

04:31.470 --> 04:33.404
run upstairs
and get that box.

04:33.472 --> 04:35.673
Oh, yeah.
What box is that?

04:35.741 --> 04:38.943
Their travel folders.
Every winter when daddy
gets cold,

04:39.011 --> 04:43.481
they sit and dream about
moving out west, but they
never get out the box.

04:43.548 --> 04:48.819
Out of the box. Well,
listen, someday I might just
surprise you, little girl.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.089
"Chester byrd real estate."

04:51.156 --> 04:55.894
This looks like a legitimate
reality company here--
Chester byrd.

04:55.961 --> 05:01.532
You know, I think I'm
just gonna call this guy up,
see what's goin' on.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.636
You're wasting your time.
Boy, talk about acting out
your fantasies.

05:05.704 --> 05:09.974
Aw, button up, youse two.
What's the harm in callin'
the guy, huh?

05:10.042 --> 05:12.777
Just to see what he says.
There we are.

05:12.844 --> 05:14.879
Here's the box, Archie.

05:14.947 --> 05:19.650
All right, Edith.
I'm on the line here.
[ Clears throat ]

05:19.718 --> 05:25.023
Hello. Uh, Chester byrd?
Oh, this is Mr. byrd.

05:25.090 --> 05:28.692
This is Archie bunker
of 704 hauser street,

05:28.760 --> 05:32.096
my residence from which
I'm calling you here.

05:32.164 --> 05:35.400
And I just found
a leaflet at my door,

05:35.467 --> 05:38.536
and the words
"substantial profit"
caught my eye.

05:38.603 --> 05:42.073
I was wondering
what that would come to
in dollars and cents.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.509
Not on the phone? Ah.

05:45.577 --> 05:49.847
Oh, you could come over?
Oh, sure. Sure.

05:49.915 --> 05:52.683
You can come on over.
Why not?

05:52.751 --> 05:56.120
Yeah, fine. Okay. Bye.

05:56.188 --> 05:59.123
Ah. Never make a move, huh?

05:59.191 --> 06:02.427
Well, Mr. Chester byrd,
whose office is just up here
on the boulevard,

06:02.494 --> 06:04.528
will be around
in three minutes.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.065
Edith, what are you
sticking in my spine?

06:07.132 --> 06:09.067
You wanted the box.

06:09.134 --> 06:12.170
Can't you just leave it
over there?
Sure.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.439
Archie, you'd really
leave New York?

06:14.506 --> 06:19.610
I might. After all,
why not, huh? What's
the big attraction here?

06:19.678 --> 06:23.848
The weather out there,
which is always "louzay."

06:23.915 --> 06:27.151
Edith, read some of them
pamphlets there.

06:27.219 --> 06:30.455
"Come to the land
of milk and honey."

06:30.522 --> 06:34.425
Yeah, California.
No, Archie.
That's Israel.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.564
Oh, here it is.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.203
"California--
the land of sunshine."

06:45.270 --> 06:48.206
Yeah, sunshine
and clean air.

06:48.273 --> 06:51.509
Archie's cousin Rudy
lives out there.

06:51.576 --> 06:54.612
Bertha's boy. In el monte.

06:54.679 --> 06:59.583
El monte.
Oh, don't that sound pretty?

07:00.752 --> 07:04.122
Just imagine--
he says in the morning...

07:04.189 --> 07:07.291
You can reach your hand
out the bedroom window...

07:07.359 --> 07:10.561
And pick an orange
off the tree.

07:10.629 --> 07:13.264
You done that in New York,
you get your hand mugged.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.535
Come on, Archie. California's
just as bad as New York.

07:17.602 --> 07:21.906
Oh, listen to our
world traveler over here.

07:21.973 --> 07:24.275
Never been west
of the Chicago stockyards,

07:24.343 --> 07:27.178
but now he's a regular
Marco Polish.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.815
Funny, arch.
That's funny.

07:31.883 --> 07:35.319
I suppose it wouldn't be nice
to live in a neighborhood
where you go for a walk...

07:35.387 --> 07:37.821
Without fearing to take
your life in your hands.

07:37.889 --> 07:40.191
Oh, come on, arch.
What are you talkin' about?

07:40.259 --> 07:42.626
You can't run away.
There's no hiding place.

07:42.694 --> 07:46.297
Oh, yes there is--
safe city.
Safe city?

07:46.365 --> 07:50.134
That's right.
Safe city, California.
Right here.

07:50.202 --> 07:53.871
Where the minorities
don't outnumber the majorities.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.177
Look what they got here.
Tv monitors in all the lobbies.

07:59.244 --> 08:02.180
They got-- they got
special locks all over.

08:02.247 --> 08:06.684
They got armed guards
around the clock and a 12-foot
wall around the whole place.

08:06.751 --> 08:10.121
It's beautiful.
He's gonna move
to San Quentin.

08:11.756 --> 08:14.692
No. Santa Monica.

08:14.759 --> 08:16.994
Right on the ocean.

08:17.062 --> 08:22.666
"Just off the centinela exit
of the Santa Monica freeway."

08:22.734 --> 08:26.204
Oh, my, don't that sound
romantic?

08:26.271 --> 08:31.409
The centinela exit
of the Santa Monica freeway.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.044
Sounds a whole lot better
than flushing.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.452
Or the gawanus canal.

08:41.520 --> 08:46.657
Which if you threw a stick
into it, it wouldn't splash,
it bends.

08:46.725 --> 08:48.726
Daddy, what would you do
about a job?

08:48.793 --> 08:51.729
Yeah, that's right, arch.
I hear they're laying off
lots of men in California.

08:51.796 --> 08:54.665
- Things are pretty bad there.
- They ain't bad for everybody.

08:54.733 --> 08:56.867
Come on, arch.
I've heard you say
it a hundred times.

08:56.935 --> 08:59.036
You'd never move
out of this neighborhood.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.672
You never even go anywhere
when you have a vacation.

09:01.740 --> 09:05.343
Oh, we did once.
Archie took me to Atlantic city.

09:05.410 --> 09:08.513
Sure.
I'm willing to travel.

09:08.580 --> 09:13.184
We had to come home, though,
after only two days.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.987
Because you said you couldn't
use a strange bathroom.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.862
Will you stifle yourself?

09:24.929 --> 09:28.832
We came home early
because you went crazy
in the ocean.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.835
Your mother, instead of staying
with me there in the water,
holdin' onto the rope,

09:31.903 --> 09:35.573
she turns over on her back
and goes floatin' out to sea.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.875
Like mopey dick.

09:37.942 --> 09:40.344
The great white dingbat.

09:42.047 --> 09:45.483
I'm a good floater.
Stifle yourself!

09:45.551 --> 09:49.487
<i>[ Doorbell buzzes ]</i>
<i>There he is. There he is.</i>
<i>There's Chester byrd now.</i>

09:49.555 --> 09:54.258
Don't do anything, Edith.
Youse two sit there like you
don't care about nothin', right?

09:54.326 --> 09:56.860
Edith, don't open the door yet.
Let me get into the kitchen...

09:56.928 --> 09:59.930
'Cause I don't want him
to think I'm too anxious
about anything, see?

09:59.998 --> 10:03.634
When I'm in here,
you open the door.
Go ahead now.

10:03.702 --> 10:07.505
Oh.
Mrs. bunker? Chester byrd,
Chester byrd real estate.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.242
How do you do?
Won't you come in?
Thank you.

10:11.310 --> 10:15.379
Let me take your coat.
My husband is in the kitchen.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.549
Archie, Mr. byrd is here.

10:20.985 --> 10:25.823
[ Archie ]
Oh, is he? Say, would you like
a nice soft drink, Mr. byrd?

10:25.890 --> 10:29.327
Or would you prefer
somethin' hard?
Soft will be fine.

10:29.394 --> 10:31.662
Pour yourself
a hard one, arch.

10:39.371 --> 10:42.707
Won't you sit down,
Mr. byrd?

10:42.774 --> 10:46.477
You know, I get
a real homey feeling here.
A real welcome feeling.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.913
Oh, I'm very glad you do.

10:49.981 --> 10:54.518
Here we are. A little light
refreshments in order
before we start to talk--

10:56.488 --> 11:00.591
thank you, Mr. bunker.
You're colored.

11:02.093 --> 11:05.129
Gee, arch,
we didn't think you'd notice.

11:06.598 --> 11:09.199
You didn't sound colored
on the phone.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.702
I used a white telephone.

11:17.542 --> 11:20.478
Well, shall we
get down to business?
Well, uh--

11:20.545 --> 11:23.481
[ phone ringing ]
Wait a minute. Hold it.
Hold everything here.

11:23.548 --> 11:26.216
The telephone.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.218
Hello.

11:28.287 --> 11:31.455
Oh, it's you, mcnab.
What do you want?

11:31.523 --> 11:34.759
You saw who comin' in?

11:38.029 --> 11:43.133
Listen, mcnab, don't give me--
hey, mcnab, keep your shirt on,
will ya?

11:43.201 --> 11:45.603
No, I ain't-- I--

11:45.671 --> 11:49.573
I ain't gonna "ell-say"
the "ouse-hay" to no "Ade-spay."

11:54.613 --> 11:58.248
Just calm down, will ya?
I'll talk to you about
it later. Good-bye.

12:00.419 --> 12:03.954
Well, uh, Mr. byrd,

12:04.022 --> 12:07.792
all I got to say to you is...
Thanks for droppin' by.

12:07.859 --> 12:10.761
Wait a minute, Mr. bunker.
I came to talk
about your house.

12:10.829 --> 12:14.298
Well, uh, I just made up my mind
that I-I ain't gonna sell it.

12:14.366 --> 12:18.202
Oh? Has something happened
to color your decision?

12:18.269 --> 12:21.238
Now, wait a minute.
Color ain't got nothin'
to do with it.

12:21.306 --> 12:24.208
See, I just don't
want to sell you my house,

12:24.275 --> 12:27.578
and that's all there is to it,
Mr. blackbird-- byrd.

12:34.586 --> 12:38.222
My decision is, uh--
my decision is final,

12:38.289 --> 12:41.492
and you ain't got enough money
to change my mind...

12:41.560 --> 12:44.061
So there's no sense
in you wastin' your time.

12:44.128 --> 12:48.065
Well, it's my time.
Yeah, well, after all,
I can throw figures at you,

12:48.132 --> 12:50.668
but then you ain't got
the money to pay.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.571
Try me.
What do you have to lose?

12:53.638 --> 12:56.907
Well, if that's the only way
you'll take a no, all right.
I'll throw figures at you.

12:56.975 --> 13:00.911
I could say-- I could say,
what, uh, $35,000.

13:00.979 --> 13:03.280
"Old-say."
Huh?

13:03.348 --> 13:05.349
Sold.

13:15.827 --> 13:19.897
I don't believe it!
$35,000 for this house?

13:19.964 --> 13:23.868
Uh, Mr. byrd,
what my son-in-law means
is that for all we know...

13:23.935 --> 13:26.470
This house could maybe
be worth a lot more.

13:26.538 --> 13:30.674
Would you sit down there,
Michael, please?

13:30.742 --> 13:35.345
Don't get me wrong, Mr. byrd.
$35,000 is pretty good
as a startin' figure.

13:35.414 --> 13:39.216
Oh, come on, Mr. bunker.
Let's be up front
with each other.

13:39.284 --> 13:43.621
Your house is only
worth $35,000 to me.
I'll tell you why.

13:43.688 --> 13:48.058
You see, it's just that
black people can't get into
neighborhoods like this.

13:48.126 --> 13:50.961
Now, there are a lot of houses
just like yours on the block.

13:51.029 --> 13:54.765
So if you don't
want to sell, I'm sure
one of your neighbors will.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.602
After that, when a few more
black families move in,
[ Chuckles ]

13:58.670 --> 14:02.473
Your house is gonna be
worth less-- a lot less.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.475
Blockbuster!
What?

14:04.543 --> 14:07.277
Archie, this guy's
a blockbuster!
Oh, will you sit down!

14:07.345 --> 14:10.981
He buys one or two houses
at a top price and gets
the rest at rock bottom.

14:11.049 --> 14:13.283
It's free enterprise, boy,
and I'm a business man.

14:13.351 --> 14:16.386
Yeah! It's a rotten business!
Archie, don't you see?

14:16.455 --> 14:19.590
He buys homes from whites
and then takes advantage
of his own people...

14:19.658 --> 14:22.726
By selling to them
for two or three times
what a house is worth.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.729
You know, Mr. bunker,
your son-in-law reminds me
of my kid brother.

14:25.797 --> 14:28.332
Head in the clouds. No idea
what it takes to get along
in the world.

14:28.399 --> 14:30.468
Meathead, huh?
Exactly.

14:30.535 --> 14:33.504
Archie, don't you see
what he's doing?
Will you sit down!

14:33.572 --> 14:36.607
But, Archie--
well, what do you say,
Mr. bunker?

14:36.675 --> 14:39.376
Do we have a deal at 35?
I've got the papers right here.

14:39.444 --> 14:41.545
Yes. Right there.
Good.

14:41.613 --> 14:44.314
That'll be just fine.
Edith, get away from me.

14:44.382 --> 14:47.150
<i>Here's a pen.</i>
<i>Archie.</i>

14:47.218 --> 14:50.120
Owww!

14:52.090 --> 14:55.860
What are you doing
to my arm?
I gotta speak to you, Archie.

14:55.927 --> 14:59.196
Mr. byrd, I'd like to talk
to my husband for a minute.

14:59.263 --> 15:01.365
Is that all right?
Go right ahead.

15:01.432 --> 15:05.503
What is the matter with you?
Archie, I don't think
we should sell the house.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.605
What? For $35,000?

15:07.672 --> 15:10.374
But I'm not sure
I want to move to California.

15:10.441 --> 15:15.145
$35,000. $35,000!
Archie, I don't--

15:19.384 --> 15:22.019
we may never get a chance
like this again, Edith.

15:22.086 --> 15:25.489
And listen,
it ain't just the money.
You'll love it out there.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.491
Just imagine yourself
all year long...

15:27.559 --> 15:30.327
Runnin' around
with just a blouse
and a pair of pants.

15:30.395 --> 15:33.898
But you don't like me
in pants, Archie.

15:33.965 --> 15:36.600
Out there
I'll like you in pants.

15:36.668 --> 15:39.436
But we're rushing into it,
Archie.

15:39.504 --> 15:43.641
Can't we sit down
and talk it over?
No! I wanna make this deal!

15:43.708 --> 15:45.643
No! Mr. byrd,
Edith!

15:45.710 --> 15:49.046
We would like to sit down
and talk this over as a family.

15:49.113 --> 15:51.849
Is that all right?
Sure. I understand.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.785
I'll sit in my car
until you're ready.
Oh, thank you.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.320
Wait a minute there,
Mr. byrd. Uh, listen.

15:57.388 --> 16:00.490
Don't worry about this here.
You and me is gonna do business.
Good. Good.

16:00.559 --> 16:04.562
Oh, and by the way, when
you come back, this door ain't
such a good idea comin' in.

16:04.629 --> 16:07.464
If you could--
sure. Sure.

16:07.532 --> 16:10.768
I understand.
I'll go around to the--
to the back door?

16:10.835 --> 16:14.705
Yeah. Because, you know,
these nosy neighbors, watchin'
everything on the street, see?

16:14.773 --> 16:17.041
Sure. I understand.
All right. I'll see you,
Mr. bunker.

16:17.108 --> 16:20.310
Yeah. When you sit in
your car, keep your
head down, huh?

16:22.047 --> 16:26.383
Archie--
don't argue
with me, nobody! I'm gonna
make this deal, $35,000.

16:26.451 --> 16:30.187
Call Rudy in California.
On the phone?

16:30.254 --> 16:34.024
No, Edith. Open up
the window and holler.
Get him on the phone.

16:34.092 --> 16:36.293
Archie, how can you sell
to a blockbuster?

16:36.360 --> 16:39.196
Daddy, think of what
you're doing to those
poor black families.

16:39.263 --> 16:41.599
What is the matter with you
two bleedin' heart liberals?

16:41.666 --> 16:45.102
See what I'm doin'?
I'm givin' a family of deservin'
coloreds a chance to move...

16:45.169 --> 16:48.038
Into a decent neighborhood,
away from their own kind.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.040
And youse two here
are fightin' me.

16:50.108 --> 16:52.242
Yeah, that's right. 'Cause it's
your pocketbook that's talkin'.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.311
You couldn't care less
about helpin' blacks.

16:54.378 --> 16:57.715
- Archie, it's ringin'.
- The two of youse,
just butt out of this thing.

16:57.782 --> 17:02.086
And, Edith, no more arguments
out of you. Give me the phone.
All of youse, dummy up.

17:02.153 --> 17:07.657
[ Clears throat ]
Hello. Rudy? Hey, this is
cousin Archie in New York.

17:07.726 --> 17:12.730
Yeah. How are you? Hey,
how's the weather out there?

17:12.797 --> 17:16.900
Oh, 85 degrees?
Oh, beautiful!

17:16.968 --> 17:20.904
Hey, Rudy, the reason
I called is, I got a chance
today to sell the house.

17:20.972 --> 17:24.174
Yeah, sure. Maybe I'll make
20,000 profit or more.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.011
<i>Pretty good, huh?</i>
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

17:27.078 --> 17:29.513
If I close the deal,
sell the house
and get the cash,

17:29.580 --> 17:32.082
and if I can come out there
to California, could you--

17:32.150 --> 17:35.653
huh? You what? You could?

17:35.720 --> 17:39.289
Oh, geez!
Oh, boy, that's great!

17:39.357 --> 17:42.492
Hey, Rudy, you're a peach.
Wait till I tell Edith.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.929
Hey, listen.
I'll call you back. I'm gonna
close the deal any minute.

17:45.997 --> 17:49.299
You hang around by the phone,
huh? Okay, Rudy. Bye.

17:49.367 --> 17:53.336
Now that clinches it.
Not only has Rudy got a job
waitin' for me out there,

17:53.404 --> 17:56.640
but he's gonna let us all
stay in his beautiful home
till we find a place of our own.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.543
But, Archie, I thought
we were gonna talk it over.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.578
What else is there
to talk over, Edith?

18:01.646 --> 18:03.446
What kind of job
are you gonna get?

18:03.514 --> 18:07.017
It ain't a job, it's a position.
Rudy owns a factory out there.

18:07.085 --> 18:10.988
- Practically offered me
a partnership just now.
- Daddy, why should he do that?

18:11.056 --> 18:14.224
Cousin Rudy's almost
a stranger. He's never
even been to the house.

18:14.292 --> 18:16.860
'Cause he's been out in
California makin' a fortune.

18:16.928 --> 18:21.431
He's a smart young guy.
Edith, tell 'em about Rudy.
Where the hell are ya?

18:21.499 --> 18:24.702
What are you doin' over here?
We're talkin' about
California there.

18:24.769 --> 18:28.706
I'm just lookin' where
we used to measure Gloria.

18:28.773 --> 18:34.178
Here she is at eleven,
and here she is at two.
Remember?

18:34.245 --> 18:37.247
Will you stop swingin'
down memory Lane!

18:37.315 --> 18:40.483
These things don't mean
nothin'. We got a new future
waitin' for us.

18:40.551 --> 18:44.121
Get away from the closet here.
Where you goin' now?

18:44.189 --> 18:46.423
I'm gonna miss these stairs.

18:46.490 --> 18:50.761
Remember how beautiful
Gloria looked...

18:50.829 --> 18:54.531
The day of her wedding,
coming down those steps?

18:54.599 --> 18:58.235
And how do you feel
goin' up and down them steps
all day long, Edith?

18:58.302 --> 19:00.437
In California, you ain't
gonna have to do that.

19:00.504 --> 19:05.275
Everything's on one level.
They ain't got a flight
of stairs in the state.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.381
What about all our things?
What about it, Edith?

19:11.449 --> 19:14.785
Look at it. It's all crummy.
We're gonna sell
the whole lot here.

19:14.853 --> 19:18.722
All except my own chair
here, which is kind of
a one-of-a-kind chair.

19:18.790 --> 19:23.093
- [ Sobbing ]
- <i>Edith, don't start</i>
<i> </i> <i>bawling now.</i>

19:23.161 --> 19:28.098
I can't help it, Archie.
I'm used to this house.

19:28.166 --> 19:32.069
And now I'll have to go
to someplace strange...

19:32.137 --> 19:35.705
And get used
to everything new.

19:35.774 --> 19:40.410
And wear pants!
[ Sobbing ]

19:42.814 --> 19:47.084
Will you explain your mother
to me? There she goes bawlin'.
<i>[ Doorbell buzzing ]</i>

19:47.152 --> 19:50.087
Five minutes ago,
she's reachin' out
the window for oranges.

19:50.155 --> 19:53.757
You'd never understand it.
Oh, hi, Lionel.
Hey. How's it goin'?

19:53.825 --> 19:57.261
Hiya, Lionel. Come on in.
I got some big news for you.

19:57.328 --> 20:00.230
You're gonna have
some new friends.
Some coloreds are movin' in.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.233
No! Where?
Right here in this house.

20:03.301 --> 20:05.669
They're gonna
move in with you?

20:05.736 --> 20:09.339
Oh, not that, Lionel.
I mean they're gonna move
here after I leave.

20:09.407 --> 20:12.042
I'm gonna sell 'em
the house.
Oh.

20:12.110 --> 20:15.045
You wouldn't happen
to be selling to a Mr. byrd,
would you?

20:15.113 --> 20:17.414
You know the guy?
Yeah, I know him.

20:17.481 --> 20:19.349
He's what we call
an oreo cookie.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.751
An oreo cookie?

20:21.820 --> 20:26.256
Yeah. You know,
black on the outside,
white on the inside.

20:26.324 --> 20:29.893
Oh. Yeah.

20:29.961 --> 20:33.864
I'm glad you like him.
I thought he was
a decent guy too.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.433
Yeah, I figured you would.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.670
<i>[ Doorbell buzzing ]</i>
<i>Excuse me, Lionel. There he is.</i>
<i>I'm off to California.</i>

20:40.738 --> 20:44.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You goin' to California?
Yeah.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.212
Oh, you ain't
gonna be happy there.
Why not?

20:48.279 --> 20:51.281
Well, California's
right next door to watts.

20:54.719 --> 20:57.921
Archie,
Mr. byrd is here.

20:57.989 --> 21:00.891
Oh, here we are.
Welcome back, Mr. byrd.
Are you ready to sign?

21:00.959 --> 21:03.460
I certainly am.
Good, good. I have
the papers right here.

21:03.527 --> 21:06.864
Let's close this deal.
Archie, before you sign,
can I say something?

21:06.931 --> 21:09.199
Aw, make it fast,
will you, Edith?

21:09.267 --> 21:14.071
Archie, I'm your wife,
and I've always done
what you wanted...

21:14.138 --> 21:16.907
Even when you were
wrong, like now.

21:18.376 --> 21:21.444
Whatever you do,
I'll go along with you.

21:21.512 --> 21:23.546
You're gonna love it,
Edith.

21:23.614 --> 21:27.317
But I'm not leavin'
my five-quart casserole...

21:27.385 --> 21:29.953
No matter what you say!

21:30.021 --> 21:33.823
Give me the contract
and the pen.
Where do I sign?

21:33.892 --> 21:36.894
- Right here.
- Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?

21:36.961 --> 21:41.899
Is that Bertha over there?
Hiya, Bertha! Come on in!
<i>Archie!</i>

21:41.966 --> 21:46.303
Come on over there
and sit down. Hey, Edith,
come and see who's here.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.939
Hey, did you get the news
from Rudy in California?

21:49.007 --> 21:52.376
I just got off the phone
with him, and I ran
all the way over here.

21:52.443 --> 21:54.844
Cousin Bertha,
how are you?

21:54.913 --> 21:58.515
Oh, Edith. I know
he never would've done it
without your support.

21:58.582 --> 22:02.085
Thank you.
Is Rudy happy I'm comin'
out to California?

22:02.153 --> 22:05.222
Happy? He's delirious.
[ Laughing ]

22:05.290 --> 22:08.758
Oh, I tell you,
he just said last week,

22:08.826 --> 22:12.930
if he could only get ahold
of $20,000, he could get
his head above water.

22:12.997 --> 22:18.468
I tell you, Archie,
he's been sinkin', goin'
down for the third time.

22:18.536 --> 22:22.072
Well, you remember my boy Rudy--
nothin' worked for him here.

22:22.140 --> 22:25.342
Well, the same thing out there.
Every time he opens a business,

22:25.410 --> 22:27.945
his first customer
is the sheriff.

22:28.012 --> 22:32.983
Bankruptcy. And his own brother
wouldn't even loan him a dime.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.853
His Uncle George,
worth a fortune, wouldn't
even come to the phone.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.522
Oh, Archie,

22:39.590 --> 22:43.427
you're givin' him another
chance with your $20,000.

22:45.463 --> 22:49.232
Oh, Archie,
I can just see it--
the two of you together.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.502
You'll be the father
he's always needed.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.574
I've gotta go, Archie.

22:57.641 --> 23:02.079
Honest, Rudy is so excited,
he can't wait till you
get out there.

23:02.146 --> 23:06.049
He's getting the garage
all fixed up for you
to live in.

23:12.223 --> 23:14.224
Well, Mr. bunker,
shall we get on with it?

23:14.292 --> 23:17.694
Well, Mr. byrd, I think
before we get any deeper
in this,

23:17.761 --> 23:19.963
I'd better consider my wife's
feelings a little more.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.966
But I just heard her say
she was willing to go along
with you.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.535
Yeah, but then we got...
My son-in-law here.

23:25.603 --> 23:29.039
He don't adjust too easy.
He can't be moved.

23:29.107 --> 23:32.142
Mr. bunker, you're wasting
my time. Is it yes or no?
No.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.012
Well, I'll just have to talk
with some of your neighbors.

23:35.079 --> 23:39.016
I don't think that's
gonna do you any good, Mr. byrd.
They ain't gonna sell to you.

23:39.083 --> 23:42.886
I think you'll find
that all of my neighbors
is just about like me.

23:42.953 --> 23:45.155
They're all just like you, huh?
[ Chuckles ]

23:45.223 --> 23:49.393
That's what
I'm countin' on. Bye.

23:49.460 --> 23:53.430
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.
Archie, where are you goin'?

23:53.498 --> 23:57.867
Oh, the meathead was right.
That guy is a "blackbuster."

23:59.470 --> 24:02.172
I want you to call
all the neighbors.
Tell them I'm comin' over.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.941
I'm startin' with Jimmy mcnab.
That money-hungry Mick.

24:05.009 --> 24:08.278
He'd sell his own mother
for $35,000.

24:08.346 --> 24:10.780
So would most of the people
on this here block.

24:10.848 --> 24:13.450
There's not a one of them with
enough strength of character...

24:13.518 --> 24:16.119
To stand up to that guy
like I done.

24:21.825 --> 24:24.928
I've never been
this hot in my life.

24:24.995 --> 24:27.931
Oh, boy, Archie,
what's with that furnace?

24:27.998 --> 24:32.735
Aw, nuts to you.
Can't you see me workin'
on the thermostat here?

24:32.803 --> 24:36.239
Well, hurry it up.
I'm sweatin' my brains out here.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.309
You done that
when you was in diapers.

24:41.579 --> 24:43.746
Aw, geez!

24:43.814 --> 24:45.882
Well, there it goes!

24:45.950 --> 24:49.219
It's your fault for complainin'
about the heat around here.

24:49.287 --> 24:52.055
Now I'm gonna have to get
a service man in tomorrow.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.624
It's gonna cost me
an arm and a leg.

24:54.692 --> 24:56.859
Here we are.
This'll cool us off.

24:56.927 --> 25:00.930
Ice-cold lemonade.
There.

25:00.998 --> 25:06.136
Ain't this nice?
Just like California.

25:06.204 --> 25:10.873
Will you please
stifle yourself?

25:31.061 --> 25:35.465
