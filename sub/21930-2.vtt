WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:06.771
Uh, One dumpling left.
Who wants it?

00:06.773 --> 00:09.874
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

00:09.876 --> 00:12.577
And that would be...

00:14.314 --> 00:15.814
Me, Sheldon.

00:15.816 --> 00:16.948
I'm obviously pregnant.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.084
Well, you never
said it to my face.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.985
And the last time I assumed
a woman was pregnant,

00:20.987 --> 00:23.021
it did not go over well.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.824
Yeah, I'm still mad at you.
(clears throat)

00:25.826 --> 00:28.326
You were drinking water
instead of wine.

00:28.328 --> 00:29.661
What was I supposed
to think?

00:29.663 --> 00:31.596
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Sheldon's right.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.798
I would never ask a woman
if she was pregnant,

00:33.800 --> 00:36.835
unless she tells me
or I see a human being

00:36.837 --> 00:38.770
wiggling out of her.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.006
Well, Sheldon,
I'm pregnant.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.509
Congratulations.
How far along are you?

00:44.511 --> 00:45.677
About three months.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.846
Only three?

00:48.915 --> 00:52.117
Good gravy, how many
babies are in there?

00:53.286 --> 00:54.719
Okay, let's talk
about something

00:54.721 --> 00:58.490
that won't infuriate
my pregnant wife.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.525
I read an interesting fact
about elephants.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.595
Try again.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.796
Oh, I've got something.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.298
I'm being interviewed
on public radio this Friday.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.466
Oh, cool. How come?

01:08.468 --> 01:10.235
Uh, the university is trying
to get more funding

01:10.237 --> 01:11.302
for the physics department,

01:11.304 --> 01:12.937
so they want me to
go out and talk it up.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.773
Really? You?

01:16.109 --> 01:17.876
(whispering indistinctly)

01:17.878 --> 01:21.246
Well, they picked the right
person for the job.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.347
Thank you.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.983
I think he bought it.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.954
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

01:57.956 --> 01:59.256
Joining me today

01:59.258 --> 02:00.891
is my guest physicist,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

02:00.893 --> 02:02.492
to talk about

02:02.494 --> 02:05.562
all of the exciting research
they're doing at Cal Tech.

02:05.564 --> 02:08.031
Thank you for having me.
Whoa... (chuckles)

02:08.032 --> 02:10.267
Could never get used to
hearing myself in headphones.

02:10.269 --> 02:11.501
Is that really how I sound?

02:11.503 --> 02:14.037
(chuckles)
It is. It is.

02:14.039 --> 02:17.107
(deep voice):
That is good to know.

02:17.109 --> 02:19.042
I told him his voice
was annoying.

02:19.044 --> 02:21.111
He didn't want to listen.

02:21.113 --> 02:22.245
Hey...

02:22.247 --> 02:23.980
You're saying it's not?

02:23.982 --> 02:26.750
Just... hey.

02:26.752 --> 02:29.219
FLATOW:
So, it has been five years

02:29.221 --> 02:31.221
since the discovery
of the Higgs boson...

02:31.223 --> 02:33.557
what's the next big thing
gonna be?

02:33.559 --> 02:35.025
Wow, that's hard to say.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.226
There's so much going on.

02:36.228 --> 02:37.928
We've been collecting
tons of data

02:37.930 --> 02:40.797
that could revolutionize the way
we understand the universe.

02:40.799 --> 02:43.400
For instance, there's a particle
called a squark,

02:43.402 --> 02:45.368
which could prove supersymmetry.

02:45.370 --> 02:47.203
That is interesting.
Have you found it?

02:47.205 --> 02:48.672
- What, the squark?
- Yes.

02:48.674 --> 02:50.674
No, no.

02:51.410 --> 02:53.843
Wouldn't that be exciting?

02:53.845 --> 02:56.079
But we're also looking
for the selectron,

02:56.081 --> 02:57.514
the gluino and the neutralino.

02:57.516 --> 03:00.417
- Well, and have you found that?
- No.

03:00.419 --> 03:02.085
LEONARD:
Another fun sidenote...

03:02.087 --> 03:05.221
I went to high school with
a girl named Theresa Gluino,

03:05.223 --> 03:07.924
but it didn't cost $2 billion
to find her.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.727
She was smoking behind the gym.
(laughs)

03:12.030 --> 03:13.663
So, what have you found?

03:13.665 --> 03:14.998
Uh, nothing, actually.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.600
Should he be saying that?

03:16.602 --> 03:18.735
Uh, probably not.

03:18.737 --> 03:20.303
Yeah, this is public radio.

03:20.305 --> 03:23.473
Doesn't he realize that dozens
of people might hear him?

03:25.010 --> 03:27.010
But I remain confident.

03:27.012 --> 03:29.379
We've got the best equipment
and the best minds

03:29.381 --> 03:30.680
all working on it.

03:30.682 --> 03:32.716
Okay, sounds like
he's back on track.

03:32.718 --> 03:34.084
LEONARD:
Although, some days

03:34.086 --> 03:35.418
I'm, like, ugh...

03:35.420 --> 03:37.053
we've spent so much <i>money.</i>

03:37.055 --> 03:40.890
Why haven't we found <i>anything?</i>
What are we <i>doing?</i>

03:43.395 --> 03:45.695
Oh, boy.

03:49.001 --> 03:50.834
There's Leonard.

03:50.836 --> 03:53.236
I'll bet he's having
a rough day. (chuckles)

03:53.238 --> 03:54.571
Let's just try to be supportive.

03:54.573 --> 03:55.939
Supportive?

03:55.941 --> 03:58.008
He publicly maligned
the love of my life,

03:58.010 --> 04:00.310
Lady Physics.

04:00.312 --> 04:03.780
You might not want to
mention that to Lady Fiancée.

04:03.782 --> 04:05.715
Hey, guys.

04:05.717 --> 04:07.384
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, how's it going?

04:07.386 --> 04:10.020
(scoffs)

04:10.022 --> 04:12.555
What?
You got something to say?

04:12.557 --> 04:15.892
I think I just said it.

04:15.894 --> 04:17.827
P-F-F.

04:18.730 --> 04:20.497
Pff!

04:23.001 --> 04:25.135
Look, I-I was just
speaking the truth.

04:25.137 --> 04:27.704
We're scientists... isn't that
what we're supposed to do?

04:27.706 --> 04:29.139
Oh, what would you know
about the truth?

04:29.141 --> 04:32.676
You thought <i>Phantom Menace</i>
was "not half bad."

04:33.679 --> 04:35.979
I told you that in confidence!

04:35.981 --> 04:40.083
Okay, calm down.
Everybody just cool it.

04:40.085 --> 04:41.217
No, let 'em go.
If we get lucky,

04:41.219 --> 04:43.219
maybe one of them
will start crying.

04:43.221 --> 04:47.223
Uh, can we just drop this
and have lunch like adults?

04:47.225 --> 04:49.559
- Fine.
- Very well.

04:51.430 --> 04:52.796
- Leonard?
- What?

04:52.798 --> 04:54.964
Pff!

04:56.134 --> 04:57.867
(knock on door)

04:57.869 --> 04:59.302
You ready for lunch?

04:59.304 --> 05:01.237
Oh, one second.

05:01.239 --> 05:04.174
Ooh, someone's got a lot
of fancy new lab equipment.

05:04.176 --> 05:07.577
I know. The university has been
throwing money at my study.

05:07.579 --> 05:09.212
With any luck,
there'll be a brain disease

05:09.214 --> 05:10.613
with my name on it.

05:10.615 --> 05:12.615
Fingers crossed.

05:12.617 --> 05:15.685
Which is ironic, because
if you had Fowler's palsy,

05:15.687 --> 05:17.554
you wouldn't be able
to cross your fingers.

05:19.591 --> 05:21.291
I'm surprised Sheldon's
not up here playing

05:21.293 --> 05:22.659
with all your new toys.

05:22.661 --> 05:24.561
Actually, I haven't
told him about it.

05:24.563 --> 05:26.763
We've been getting so much
more funding than physics,

05:26.765 --> 05:28.264
he's been a little sensitive.

05:28.266 --> 05:30.834
So you're just gonna hide
your success from him?

05:30.836 --> 05:32.168
I know.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.437
- Am I terrible?
- No.

05:34.439 --> 05:36.439
I do that, too.

05:37.476 --> 05:40.210
How he thought my company
retreat was in Boise?

05:40.212 --> 05:43.279
It was in Tahiti.

05:43.281 --> 05:44.981
That's such a relief.

05:44.983 --> 05:47.517
I mean, part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

05:47.519 --> 05:49.819
Take that part of yourself
and hide it away.

05:49.821 --> 05:51.821
Just like I did with
last year's bonus check

05:51.823 --> 05:53.356
that I "didn't get."

05:56.595 --> 05:58.361
(knock on door)

05:58.363 --> 05:59.896
Ms. Davis, you
wanted to see me?

05:59.898 --> 06:02.365
Yes, Dr. Hofstadter,
come on in.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.534
Should I sit or stand?

06:04.536 --> 06:06.669
I'm not used to being called
into the dean's office.

06:06.671 --> 06:08.271
Please, sit.

06:08.273 --> 06:10.940
I have to say
I'm a little nervous.

06:10.942 --> 06:12.675
You should be.

06:14.346 --> 06:15.712
Look, I know I screwed up,

06:15.714 --> 06:17.747
but it was only one interview.

06:17.749 --> 06:19.816
How much damage
could it have caused?

06:19.818 --> 06:21.918
Would you like for me
to read you the e-mails

06:21.920 --> 06:24.587
from donors asking
why are they giving us money

06:24.589 --> 06:26.156
if physics is a dead end?

06:26.158 --> 06:28.191
I didn't say it
was a dead end.

06:28.193 --> 06:30.093
I just said that I was
worried it might be.

06:30.095 --> 06:32.762
So if I just said
I was worried

06:32.764 --> 06:34.564
you might not
have a job next week,

06:34.566 --> 06:37.100
how would you feel?

06:38.136 --> 06:40.970
Light-headed, and glad
you asked me to sit down.

06:40.972 --> 06:43.473
Okay, just tell me
what I can do.

06:43.475 --> 06:45.208
I'm gonna need you
to make a statement

06:45.210 --> 06:47.844
saying that you misspoke,
and that you're confident

06:47.846 --> 06:50.713
the physics community is
close to a major breakthrough.

06:50.715 --> 06:52.849
You want me to lie.

06:52.851 --> 06:57.353
Look, Dr. Hofstadter,
I'm counting on you.

06:57.355 --> 06:59.756
I think that you are
the smartest physicist

06:59.758 --> 07:01.591
at this university.

07:01.593 --> 07:03.226
Really?

07:03.228 --> 07:06.362
See? Lies.
They're not that hard.

07:10.368 --> 07:12.035
(door opens)

07:12.037 --> 07:15.171
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.907
Huh. Looks like
you've been busy.

07:17.909 --> 07:19.509
Oh, I have.

07:19.511 --> 07:22.412
Uh, dark matter,
uh, reconciling gravity

07:22.414 --> 07:23.613
and quantum mechanics.

07:23.615 --> 07:24.948
Supersymmetry.

07:24.950 --> 07:28.017
I've figured out the biggest
problems in physics today.

07:28.019 --> 07:30.220
Wow, you solved them all?

07:30.222 --> 07:34.023
No, I just, I figured out that
they're the biggest problems.

07:35.227 --> 07:37.727
Is this about what
Leonard said on the radio?

07:37.729 --> 07:39.295
Absolutely not.

07:39.297 --> 07:41.197
And I do not want
to talk about Leonard.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.032
Can we please just talk
about anything else?

07:43.034 --> 07:44.801
We could talk about my day.

07:44.803 --> 07:47.604
Walked right into
that one, didn't I?

07:47.606 --> 07:50.840
Well, since you sort of asked,

07:50.842 --> 07:52.242
I actually had a very good day.

07:52.244 --> 07:54.244
Got some new equipment
for my lab.

07:55.881 --> 07:58.047
Well, congratulations.

07:58.049 --> 08:00.783
I got some new equipment, too.

08:00.785 --> 08:04.120
I got these markers.

08:04.122 --> 08:05.488
They smell like fruit.

08:05.490 --> 08:06.456
Which I did not notice

08:06.458 --> 08:08.424
when I bought them.
(sniffs)

08:08.426 --> 08:09.792
Don't really care for it.

08:12.297 --> 08:14.530
Here, drink this.

08:14.532 --> 08:16.432
It might help.

08:16.434 --> 08:17.667
What if it doesn't?

08:17.669 --> 08:20.803
Well, that's why
I brought the bottle.

08:21.907 --> 08:23.640
No one would talk
to me in the halls.

08:23.642 --> 08:25.308
They just glared at me.

08:25.310 --> 08:27.577
It's like high school
all over again.

08:27.579 --> 08:31.047
Oh, I would totally do
high school all over again.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.652
But that doesn't help you.
No.

08:37.087 --> 08:40.155
I got called in
to the administration office.

08:40.158 --> 08:43.993
Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.

08:43.995 --> 08:45.929
We don't technically
have a principal.

08:45.931 --> 08:48.264
There's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.566
Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions

08:50.568 --> 08:52.402
nobody asked.

08:52.404 --> 08:54.637
Hey, come on, look,
you said a few dumb things

08:54.639 --> 08:57.040
on the radio-- what is
the worst that could happen?

08:57.042 --> 09:00.176
I may get fired.

09:00.178 --> 09:03.179
Okay, well, even if you did,
you could find another job.

09:03.181 --> 09:05.815
Yeah, who wouldn't want
to hire the physicist

09:05.817 --> 09:07.984
who publicly said
physics is dead?

09:07.986 --> 09:12.021
Well, I wouldn't put that
under "special skills."

09:12.023 --> 09:15.158
I can fix it, I just need
to write a retraction

09:15.160 --> 09:18.328
I don't believe in-- basically
sell out to keep my job.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.229
Great, I'll leave you to it.

09:24.336 --> 09:26.536
Hmm.

09:33.078 --> 09:35.278
Hmm.

09:40.452 --> 09:43.086
Oy.

09:43.088 --> 09:44.253
(knocking on door)

09:44.255 --> 09:46.456
LEONARD:
Sheldon, it's me.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.226
What?

09:50.228 --> 09:52.061
Look, I know you're mad,
but I have to write a statement

09:52.063 --> 09:54.497
that says the physics community
is close to a breakthrough,

09:54.499 --> 09:55.898
and since you actually
believe that,

09:55.900 --> 09:57.700
I could really use your help.

09:57.702 --> 09:58.968
Sorry, I can't.

09:58.970 --> 10:00.570
Come on, don't be like that.

10:00.572 --> 10:03.006
I can't, because I think
you were right.

10:03.008 --> 10:04.574
What?

10:04.576 --> 10:06.275
Look.
(sighs)

10:06.277 --> 10:08.144
Not all science pans out.

10:08.146 --> 10:09.579
You know, we've
been hoping

10:09.581 --> 10:11.514
supersymmetry
was true for decades,

10:11.516 --> 10:14.250
and finally, we built
the Large Hadron Collider,

10:14.252 --> 10:16.886
which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles,

10:16.888 --> 10:18.121
and it-it hasn't.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.622
And maybe
supersymmetry,

10:19.624 --> 10:21.991
our last big idea,
is simply wrong.

10:23.428 --> 10:26.396
Well, that sounds awful.

10:26.398 --> 10:29.665
Now I get why everyone hates me.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.100
Well, on the bright side,

10:31.102 --> 10:33.002
after working together
for 15 years,

10:33.004 --> 10:36.005
you finally get to hear me say,
"You were right."

10:38.176 --> 10:41.144
Oh, yeah, you did.

10:41.146 --> 10:42.178
How's it feel?

10:42.180 --> 10:43.980
Mm, given I might be unemployed,

10:43.982 --> 10:45.515
bittersweet.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:54.934 --> 10:56.968
Read it back to me?
Oh, hang on.

10:56.970 --> 11:00.071
"Yes, one might question
the $20 billion

11:00.073 --> 11:02.139
"to build and run
the Large Hadron Collider,

11:02.141 --> 11:04.475
but on the other hand..."

11:09.148 --> 11:11.115
Okay. Um...

11:11.117 --> 11:13.918
Oh, oh! "On the other hand,
contrary to predictions,

11:13.920 --> 11:17.555
"the collider didn't create
a small black hole

11:17.557 --> 11:19.623
"that devoured the Earth
and life as we know it.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.127
So, s-- money well spent."

11:24.964 --> 11:26.764
This is depressing.

11:26.766 --> 11:28.733
Do you have any alcohol
around here?

11:28.735 --> 11:30.901
Uh, not surprisingly,
when Penny moved out,

11:30.903 --> 11:33.170
she took every last drop. Um...

11:33.172 --> 11:36.407
Oh, but I do have several
bottles of Romulan ale

11:36.409 --> 11:39.677
that I bought at Comic-Con.

11:39.679 --> 11:43.447
Isn't that just vodka
with blue dye in it?

11:43.449 --> 11:45.416
You-- first, physics,
now Romulan ale.

11:45.418 --> 11:47.685
What else would you like
to defecate on?

11:49.255 --> 11:50.955
Hey. I thought you
were coming right back.

11:50.957 --> 11:52.056
I was,

11:52.058 --> 11:53.691
but we're both depressed,
and decided

11:53.693 --> 11:55.226
to drown our sorrows.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.995
In mouthwash?

11:59.665 --> 12:03.234
Man, that is so summer camp.

12:03.236 --> 12:06.303
I-It's Romulan ale,
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

12:06.305 --> 12:08.172
It was briefly legalized
during the alliance

12:08.174 --> 12:10.174
between the Romulan Empire
and the Federation

12:10.176 --> 12:12.043
at the time of the Dominion War.

12:12.045 --> 12:14.845
Aw, now <i>I'm</i> depressed.

12:17.116 --> 12:19.984
The more I told him about
my lab, the pissier he got.

12:19.986 --> 12:21.519
You know what
he said to me?

12:21.521 --> 12:23.287
He said, "I hope
all your correlations

12:23.289 --> 12:26.791
turn out to be specious."

12:26.793 --> 12:28.959
He said that to your face?

12:28.961 --> 12:30.461
What a dick.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.566
You know,
you're a successful woman.

12:35.568 --> 12:37.568
You should be able to brag
about your accomplishments

12:37.570 --> 12:38.702
once in a while.

12:38.704 --> 12:40.171
Well, so should you.

12:40.173 --> 12:42.173
I mean, the guys
are never shy about bragging.

12:42.175 --> 12:44.141
Tell me about it.
Howie texts me

12:44.143 --> 12:47.411
every time his dog levels up
in <i>Warcraft.</i>

12:47.413 --> 12:49.380
Has he ever called you

12:49.382 --> 12:51.549
to tell you he found three
peanuts in one shell?

12:51.551 --> 12:54.318
'Cause Sheldon has.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.654
We should be able
to do that, too.

12:56.656 --> 12:59.223
I guess we can
brag to each other.

12:59.225 --> 13:00.991
That's a great idea.

13:00.993 --> 13:03.561
Damn right it is;
I came up with it.

13:03.563 --> 13:06.063
(chuckles)

13:06.065 --> 13:07.998
That felt good.

13:11.204 --> 13:13.304
You know, there's so much money
in pharmaceuticals,

13:13.306 --> 13:15.473
we don't even wash out
our test tubes.

13:15.475 --> 13:18.676
We just throw them out
and get new ones.

13:18.678 --> 13:22.913
I just got a brand-new,
state of the art fMRI machine.

13:22.915 --> 13:24.415
Whoa. Those things
are so expensive.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.716
I know.

13:25.718 --> 13:29.053
Sometimes, I just lie down
in there and take a nap.

13:29.055 --> 13:30.855
Oh.

13:30.857 --> 13:34.525
It's like a million
dollar bunk bed.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.961
At the office,
I have two assistants.

13:36.963 --> 13:38.095
I don't even
know their names,

13:38.097 --> 13:41.098
I just call them
Thing One and Thing Two.

13:42.268 --> 13:44.335
That's great. I-I
don't have assistants.

13:44.337 --> 13:46.337
Oh. I guess that's one of
the benefits

13:46.339 --> 13:48.239
of being in the private sector.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.407
That and all the money I make.

13:50.409 --> 13:53.210
Yeah, you've got that.

13:53.212 --> 13:54.645
I've got my integrity.

13:54.647 --> 13:57.681
Hard to say which is better
without making you feel bad.

14:00.453 --> 14:02.186
Okay. So you guys are upset

14:02.188 --> 14:05.356
because the collider thing
disproved your theories?

14:05.358 --> 14:07.024
I-It's worse than that.

14:07.026 --> 14:09.160
It hasn't found anything
in years, so we don't know

14:09.162 --> 14:10.694
if we're right,
we don't know if we're wrong.

14:10.696 --> 14:12.396
We don't know where to go next.

14:12.398 --> 14:17.635
All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed <i>Avatar.</i>

14:17.637 --> 14:18.836
PENNY:
Come on.

14:18.838 --> 14:20.371
You guys are physicists.

14:20.373 --> 14:22.506
Okay? You're always
gonna be physicists.

14:22.508 --> 14:25.209
And sure, sometimes,
the physics is hard,

14:25.211 --> 14:29.647
but isn't that
what makes it boring?

14:30.850 --> 14:32.183
- Hey.
- We're here.

14:32.185 --> 14:33.384
What's going on?

14:33.386 --> 14:35.920
Okay. As far as I can see,
science is dead,

14:35.922 --> 14:37.221
'cause Leonard killed it.

14:37.223 --> 14:38.389
And, uh,

14:38.391 --> 14:39.823
I don't know
who the Romulans are,

14:39.825 --> 14:42.193
but those guys
know how to party.

14:42.195 --> 14:44.094
So, what do you
want us to do?

14:44.096 --> 14:45.896
I don't know. You're scientists;
cheer them up.

14:45.898 --> 14:47.364
"Cheer them up"?

14:47.366 --> 14:49.700
Do you even know
what a scientist is?

14:50.937 --> 14:52.836
No, we don't need
to be cheered up.

14:52.838 --> 14:55.639
It just turns out that physics
is exactly like <i>Lost.</i>

14:55.641 --> 14:59.877
Started out great, and turns out
just a big old waste of time.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.012
Boo-hoo. You know
what you sound like?

15:02.014 --> 15:03.147
Babies.

15:03.149 --> 15:05.349
Two whiny babies.

15:05.351 --> 15:06.550
And there's nothing
worse than being stuck

15:06.552 --> 15:10.221
with two whiny babies!

15:10.223 --> 15:12.890
Oh.

15:24.036 --> 15:27.304
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have two babies.

15:27.306 --> 15:28.806
No, no, no, no.
Babies are great.

15:28.808 --> 15:30.407
You're lucky to
have two babies.

15:30.409 --> 15:31.875
I mean, look at me,
uh, I'm all alone.

15:31.877 --> 15:33.377
I'm never gonna have babies,

15:33.379 --> 15:37.748
'cause you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.

15:42.655 --> 15:45.322
Thanks for coming.

15:47.593 --> 15:49.460
I may not make as
much money as you,

15:49.462 --> 15:50.995
but at least I know that
I'm actually doing something

15:50.997 --> 15:52.963
that makes people's
lives better.

15:52.965 --> 15:55.733
Hey, my work makes
people's lives better.

15:55.735 --> 15:58.502
Especially if you have
moderate to severe eczema

15:58.504 --> 16:00.971
and don't mind
if you lose teeth.

16:00.973 --> 16:03.173
You're right.

16:03.175 --> 16:05.009
We both do important work.

16:05.011 --> 16:06.877
I'm trying to map the
structures of the brain,

16:06.879 --> 16:08.212
and you're trying
to convince people

16:08.214 --> 16:11.448
that itchy hair
is a real thing.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.417
It is a real thing.

16:13.419 --> 16:18.522
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

16:18.524 --> 16:20.624
I'm just saying
that my research

16:20.626 --> 16:23.661
may actually change
the world forever.

16:23.663 --> 16:25.029
I hope it does.

16:25.031 --> 16:27.197
'Cause I'm gonna see
that world from a yacht so big,

16:27.199 --> 16:30.434
you can land
a helicopter on it.

16:33.105 --> 16:35.839
(drink pouring)

16:35.841 --> 16:38.042
Physics is all
we're cut out for.

16:38.044 --> 16:41.912
I mean, if we weren't
physicists, w-what would we be?

16:41.914 --> 16:44.515
I don't know. Popular?
(chuckles)

16:44.517 --> 16:46.417
Mm-hmm.

16:46.419 --> 16:49.553
It's fine. I don't need
to be a theoretical physicist.

16:49.555 --> 16:52.122
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

16:52.124 --> 16:56.060
I could be an accountant
for the mob.

16:57.229 --> 17:01.131
I could guess
people's weight at the fair.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.534
Okay. This is getting silly.

17:03.536 --> 17:05.002
Is it?

17:05.003 --> 17:06.502
180.

17:09.175 --> 17:10.741
Okay.

17:10.742 --> 17:11.909
That is enough.

17:11.911 --> 17:13.577
Your lives are not wasted.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.779
Your careers are not
at a dead end.

17:15.781 --> 17:17.146
You just hit a
rough patch.

17:17.148 --> 17:18.715
Instead of feeling sorry
for yourselves,

17:18.718 --> 17:20.451
you need to get up
and get inspired.

17:20.453 --> 17:21.685
How?

17:21.686 --> 17:23.252
I don't know.
You know, when I'm feeling down,

17:23.255 --> 17:27.590
I go for a run, which is exactly
why I'm not 180 pounds, genius!

17:29.462 --> 17:31.395
I know where we need to go.

17:31.397 --> 17:32.730
Mm. Are we running there?
Because watching

17:32.732 --> 17:36.100
drunk Sheldon run would be
the highlight of my life.

17:36.102 --> 17:37.634
WOLOWITZ:
We're going to see

17:37.636 --> 17:38.869
Richard Feynman.

17:38.871 --> 17:41.605
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic phys...

17:41.607 --> 17:43.407
I know who he is.
Leonard dressed as him

17:43.409 --> 17:45.209
for Halloween last year.

17:48.447 --> 17:51.882
PENNY: I had no idea
Richard Feynman was dead.

17:51.884 --> 17:55.352
Yep. Most people don't know
he's actually buried right here

17:55.354 --> 17:57.054
in Altadena.

17:57.056 --> 18:01.125
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

18:02.395 --> 18:03.627
Well.
(chuckles)

18:03.629 --> 18:05.262
Here he is.

18:05.264 --> 18:07.598
Oh, wow.
He's buried with his wife.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.333
We get it. A lady loved you.

18:09.335 --> 18:11.769
Quit bragging.

18:11.771 --> 18:14.638
Feynman was so cool.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.040
When I was a kid, I'd
put on some headphones

18:17.042 --> 18:20.144
and crank up one of
his lectures and just...

18:20.146 --> 18:22.513
jam out to knowledge.

18:24.216 --> 18:25.516
This guy knew how to live.

18:25.518 --> 18:28.085
He taught himself
musical instruments.

18:28.087 --> 18:29.887
He studied Portuguese.

18:29.889 --> 18:32.055
Just to give a speech
in Brazil.

18:32.057 --> 18:35.959
The only part of me that's been
to Brazil is my bikini line.

18:35.961 --> 18:37.995
Okay.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.799
He did so much.

18:41.801 --> 18:45.102
And here we are, stuck
and letting him down.

18:45.104 --> 18:48.372
You know, Feynman used to
say he didn't do physics

18:48.374 --> 18:53.076
for the glory or the awards,
but just for the fun of it.

18:53.078 --> 18:55.879
He was right.

18:55.881 --> 18:59.683
Physics is only dead when we
stop being excited about it.

19:00.853 --> 19:03.987
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

19:03.989 --> 19:07.124
Um, I'm the one
who remembered it.

19:08.127 --> 19:09.560
Give me the bottle.

19:09.562 --> 19:11.495
I mean, it might be
a little corny, but I say

19:11.497 --> 19:14.331
we pour one out
for all the science homies

19:14.333 --> 19:15.899
who came before us.

19:15.901 --> 19:17.668
I love that.
(Wolowitz chuckles)

19:18.904 --> 19:20.304
Mm-hmm.

19:20.306 --> 19:21.638
(chuckles softly)

19:22.575 --> 19:24.842
(gags)
Here comes some more.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.313
(Sheldon retching)

19:29.315 --> 19:31.648
Ah, we got to see him run.

19:40.622 --> 19:43.122
(knocks on door)
Oh, hi, you wanted to see me?

19:43.124 --> 19:45.291
Yes. I wanted to talk to you
about the e-mail

19:45.293 --> 19:46.592
you sent me last night.

19:46.594 --> 19:49.729
I sent you an e-mail?

19:49.731 --> 19:52.865
You bet you did.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.901
"Hello.

19:54.903 --> 19:58.738
Shalom and aloha from the grave
of Richard Feynman."

19:58.740 --> 20:01.340
(groans):
Oh, it's coming back to me.

20:01.342 --> 20:03.910
"Please accept
the following retraction:

20:03.912 --> 20:06.045
"I know I said physics is dead,

20:06.047 --> 20:07.914
"but it is the opposite of dead.
