00:01.419 --> 00:02.754
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:03.171 --> 00:05.966
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:06.174 --> 00:09.135
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious death
of Jason Blossom</i>

00:09.344 --> 00:10.512
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

00:11.054 --> 00:13.473
The bookkeeping position
at my company...
It's still open.

00:13.682 --> 00:15.809
- If you're interested...
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.227
Oh, Hiram.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.646
A donation to your
re-election campaign.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.440
And Lodge Industries gets
one of the most prime

00:22.649 --> 00:24.484
pieces of real estate
in Riverdale.

00:25.110 --> 00:27.112
What did Jason do
that was so bad?

00:27.320 --> 00:28.738
Jason and Polly had a fight.

00:28.947 --> 00:31.032
Afterwards, Polly was
pretty devastated,

00:31.241 --> 00:32.784
so we sent her to a hospital.

00:33.368 --> 00:35.745
If your parents lied
about Jason and Polly,

00:35.954 --> 00:37.580
there's probably more
that they lied about.

00:37.998 --> 00:40.500
Dad, Jason and Polly
were engaged.
Did you know that?

00:40.709 --> 00:43.545
I'd die before I let them
steal my daughter.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.131
- Where is she?
- She is sick!

00:50.010 --> 00:51.094
<i>Fear.</i>

00:51.845 --> 00:54.681
<i>It's the most basic,
the most human emotion.</i>

00:56.641 --> 00:59.519
<i>As kids, we're afraid
of everything.</i>

00:59.728 --> 01:03.481
<i>- The dark...</i>
- Will you stay in my room
tonight, Polly? Please?

01:04.315 --> 01:06.443
<i>The boogeyman under the bed...</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:09.362
Mom won't let me, Betty.

01:09.571 --> 01:11.072
But I'll turn
the night-light on, okay?

01:12.907 --> 01:16.995
<i>And we pray for morning.
For the monsters to go away.</i>

01:21.750 --> 01:25.170
<i>Though they never do.
Not really.</i>

01:25.378 --> 01:27.422
<i>Just ask Jason Blossom.</i>

01:28.339 --> 01:29.883
Oh, Mom, I forgot to mention.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.093
I invited Jughead
over for breakfast.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.929
Hmm.

01:48.401 --> 01:51.279
So, Jughead...

01:51.488 --> 01:54.783
I suppose we have you
to thank for Betty's
ongoing obsession

01:54.991 --> 01:56.743
with this Jason Blossom
ghoulishness?

01:56.951 --> 01:59.746
Actually, Mom, I was the one
who asked Jughead

01:59.954 --> 02:02.082
to help me write it
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

02:03.792 --> 02:06.377
Relax, Betty.
I'm just making conversation.

02:13.218 --> 02:14.636
Do you guys have a bathroom
I could use?

02:14.844 --> 02:17.180
- Sure, I'll show you.
- No, no. I'll show him.

02:18.890 --> 02:19.724
Follow me...

02:20.683 --> 02:21.643
Jughead.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.577
<i>Another fun fact about fear.</i>

02:40.161 --> 02:41.746
<i>Sometimes it grows up
with you.</i>

02:49.129 --> 02:51.548
<i>Or it curls up inside of you,</i>

02:51.756 --> 02:53.716
<i>tightens around your guts.</i>

02:54.676 --> 02:56.553
Archie Andrews?

02:58.304 --> 03:01.307
<i>Each fall,
Riverdale High hosts
a Variety Show.</i>

03:01.641 --> 03:03.393
<i>But this event
is no mere student frolic.</i>

03:03.601 --> 03:05.186
And what will you be
auditioning with?

03:06.729 --> 03:10.150
Uh, an original song
that I wrote called <i>I'll Try.</i>

03:10.358 --> 03:12.068
Try harder!

03:12.277 --> 03:13.903
Maybe try not sucking so much.

03:21.828 --> 03:24.372
Take your time, Archie.
Though we do have
people waiting.

03:28.293 --> 03:29.711
Oh, my God, what's happening?

03:30.420 --> 03:31.796
He's choking.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.215
Archie? Clock's ticking.

03:34.966 --> 03:37.468
Excuse me. Sorry, I gotta go.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.482
When I was up there,
looking out...
I don't know, I just I froze.

03:51.691 --> 03:53.359
That was stage fright, Archie.

03:53.568 --> 03:56.946
Yeah, but when
I'm on the football field,
the stands can be packed.

03:57.155 --> 03:59.866
- Packed, and it doesn't affect
my game at all.
- Singing makes you vulnerable

04:00.074 --> 04:02.243
in a way
that football doesn't.

04:02.452 --> 04:06.164
Or maybe what I was missing
out there onstage was my team.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.124
Or at least a partner.

04:09.042 --> 04:10.710
What if we sang <i>I Got You?</i>

04:10.919 --> 04:13.296
Archie, I'm a Pussycat.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.714
We're headlining
the Variety Show.

04:14.923 --> 04:17.342
What if you sang with them
first and then me?
Just this once?

04:18.259 --> 04:20.970
- To help me get my sea legs.
- Have you met Josie?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.224
I can't step out on the Cats.

04:27.727 --> 04:31.022
"The Sisters
of Quiet Mercy."

04:32.273 --> 04:35.568
What is that? Like a church?
Or a charity?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.115
No. It's a...

04:42.158 --> 04:44.369
"Home for troubled youths.

04:44.577 --> 04:49.290
"Where disenfranchised teens
will learn such virtues
as discipline and respect,

04:49.499 --> 04:53.586
"enjoying lives
of quiet reflection
and servitude."

04:55.129 --> 04:56.798
Poor Polly.

05:00.593 --> 05:01.803
It's been months.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.098
There's gotta be a reason
my mom and dad don't want
me to see Polly.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.557
But I don't care anymore.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.894
What are you guys
talking about?
Anything I can help with?

05:10.478 --> 05:12.647
What we're attempting
is a stealth operation,
Archie.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.941
If we go in there
with the entire Scooby Gang,

05:15.149 --> 05:16.734
forget it, we're compromised.

05:17.694 --> 05:20.280
Well, don't you have to
practice for the Variety Show
anyways?

05:22.240 --> 05:24.158
Uh, no, I don't.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.371
Except that yes, you do.
Thanks to a certain
Veronica-ex-machina.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.290
- Excuse me.
- What do you mean?

05:30.498 --> 05:33.626
Oh, nothing. Just that
I had a few words
with our director/host,

05:33.835 --> 05:36.629
and reminded him
that he's heard you sing
on numerous occasions.

05:36.838 --> 05:39.048
Even though it compromises
my artistic integrity.

05:39.257 --> 05:42.302
Cutting to the chase,
you have a slot
if you want it.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.054
Veronica, thank you,
but you saw what happened.

05:45.263 --> 05:46.139
We all did.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.516
Playing my songs
in front of you guys
is one thing,

05:49.142 --> 05:51.436
but getting back up
on that stage by myself...

05:52.854 --> 05:54.022
I'm not sure if I'm ready
for that.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.982
If it's a partner
you're looking for,

05:56.190 --> 05:58.151
Veronica Lodge
is more than willing and able.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.153
Veronica, I didn't know
you could sing.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.362
Like a nightingale.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.990
What do you say, Archiekins?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.867
Be the Jay to my Bey?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.879
<i>♪ Oh, when the sun goes down
we light up this town</i>

06:18.087 --> 06:20.506
<i>♪ Let your voice get loud ♪</i>

06:20.715 --> 06:22.884
Hold up, hold up. Look, Val.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.552
You don't sing on the bridge.

06:24.761 --> 06:27.472
Actually, the bridge
is meant to be sung
by two voices.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.182
What is up with you today, J?

06:29.390 --> 06:30.725
What is up with you
today, Mel?

06:30.933 --> 06:32.101
You're asleep
at the snare drum...

06:32.310 --> 06:33.394
Relax.

06:33.603 --> 06:36.481
Josie, it's a Variety Show
in the auditorium,

06:37.065 --> 06:39.108
not show time at the Apollo.

06:39.317 --> 06:43.404
Whether you are performing
at Madison Square Garden
or Ace Bowling Alley,

06:43.613 --> 06:45.948
you do it at 150%.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.536
I'm sorry.

06:51.287 --> 06:54.165
Did you want to say something
to me, Valerie?

06:55.583 --> 06:58.753
It's just that I don't have
to deal with this diva crap
when I'm working with Archie.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.131
Working with Archie how?

07:03.716 --> 07:05.134
Co-writing songs.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.512
- Singing with him.
- Unacceptable.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.305
You sing with the Pussycats.

07:09.514 --> 07:11.307
Or with Archie.

07:11.516 --> 07:12.683
But not both.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.771
In that case, I quit.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.607
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

07:36.124 --> 07:38.042
How's the, uh,
first day going?

07:38.960 --> 07:40.086
Um...

07:42.296 --> 07:43.798
It's your books, Fred.

07:45.258 --> 07:47.802
You only have enough
in the bank to cover
three more weeks of payroll.

07:49.137 --> 07:52.807
I just don't want to... I...
I can't let my guys go.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.643
Last time I fired someone,
it was not good.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.271
I trust those guys, you know.
They trust me.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.981
That's worth everything.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.150
Yeah, but...

08:03.943 --> 08:04.777
I mean...

08:06.612 --> 08:08.364
Even putting your business
at risk?

08:09.157 --> 08:11.492
I'm waiting to hear
on this huge bid.

08:11.701 --> 08:14.162
It's a long shot, but...
You know that new development

08:14.370 --> 08:15.663
where the old drive-in
used to be?

08:15.872 --> 08:17.748
I'm thinking that
the construction

08:17.957 --> 08:19.959
could actually put me
back in the black.

08:20.168 --> 08:24.213
If I knew who the buyer was,
I would plead the case myself.

08:24.422 --> 08:26.132
So, I'm gonna do
the next best thing.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.094
Mayor McCoy is handling
all the arrangements
for the buyer.

08:30.303 --> 08:31.846
So, I invited her to dinner.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.766
Figure I can try to woo her
into giving me the contract.

08:35.975 --> 08:37.393
So, I was thinking...

08:37.602 --> 08:40.480
Maybe you could be my co-host.

08:41.981 --> 08:43.524
Yeah. I mean, of course.

08:44.734 --> 08:45.443
Good.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.321
Actually, why don't we
have the dinner at my place?

08:49.739 --> 08:52.867
It's nicer. No offense.

09:29.070 --> 09:29.904
Hey, I just wanted to
let you know,

09:30.112 --> 09:32.949
I, uh... I bought tickets
for all the guys at work
to come see you

09:33.157 --> 09:34.242
in the Variety Show.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.162
Yeah, me and Hermione...
We're gonna go together.

09:38.371 --> 09:39.956
With each other. I...

09:40.790 --> 09:42.542
I don't really know
how to say this,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.627
and I don't want to
make a too big a deal of it,
but, uh...

09:44.835 --> 09:46.504
Dad, it's okay. You're good.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.297
Yeah?

09:48.506 --> 09:50.299
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.176
I do like her, and I...

09:52.385 --> 09:54.053
You know,
I think maybe I'm ready...

09:55.137 --> 09:57.598
If this is something
that makes you happy,
then I say go for it.

09:58.724 --> 10:03.145
You're good.
Mom's good. I'm good.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.066
All right.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.696
Mom,
Valerie quit the Pussycats.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.950
- Replace her.
- Val writes our songs.
She's irreplaceable.

10:16.576 --> 10:20.204
No, Josie.
You're irreplaceable.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.957
Everyone else is disposable.

10:23.165 --> 10:26.210
You know, maybe it's not
such a bad thing
to try a new voice.

10:26.419 --> 10:27.461
- Ugh.
- A different sound.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.005
You know how your father
feels about pop music.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.631
- But it's not pop music
this time.
- Okay,

10:30.840 --> 10:33.718
well, he's catching a red eye
and missing two concert dates

10:33.926 --> 10:35.344
to see you
in this Variety Show.

10:35.553 --> 10:37.346
I would hate for you
to let him down.

10:37.555 --> 10:38.973
I understand, and I won't.

10:39.181 --> 10:42.059
Good, 'cause if you do,
he will somehow blame me.

10:42.768 --> 10:46.397
Find yourself a new Cat.
Someone skinny and beautiful.

10:46.606 --> 10:50.943
But not more skinny
and beautiful than you.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.112
And a woman of color, please.

10:53.321 --> 10:56.032
- Josie, don't forget
our branding.
- Yeah, okay. Mmm.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.491
And Josie...

10:58.451 --> 11:00.161
Don't disappoint.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.012
Are you gonna leave Dad
when he gets out of jail?

11:19.722 --> 11:22.141
Honey, why would you ask
such a thing?

11:22.350 --> 11:23.726
I saw you, Mom.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.021
With Fred Andrews
in the trailer.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.734
Oh, Veronica.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.155
Honey, I am so sorry
that you did.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.910
But I want you to know
that we've... We've never
even kissed before.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.328
Until today.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.996
What about Dad?

11:45.081 --> 11:47.291
What happens when he
comes home?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.591
I'm not sure.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.220
I'm so sorry, baby.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.432
It just happened, Veronica.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.436
And I know that this
must be confusing.

12:07.645 --> 12:10.022
Yeah, it is.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.401
So, what can I do to help?

12:18.280 --> 12:22.368
You know what, Mom?
There's actually nothing.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.417
<i>♪ I've got you</i>

12:29.625 --> 12:31.919
<i>♪ And you've got me</i>

12:32.128 --> 12:34.296
<i>♪ I've got you</i>

12:34.505 --> 12:36.757
<i>♪ And you've got me ♪</i>

12:39.427 --> 12:41.554
Not to be that girl, Archie,

12:41.762 --> 12:45.141
but I didn't get the memo
we were adding another voice
to the mix.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.394
Ronnie, hey. Great news!
Valerie quit the Pussycats.

12:50.479 --> 12:54.650
So, that makes me what, then?
Backup?

12:54.859 --> 12:57.111
No. I mean, you were
just doing it as a favor
to me, right?

12:59.363 --> 13:01.490
You are unbelievable, Archie.

13:01.699 --> 13:05.828
You literally have
zero loyalty,
you ginger Judas!

13:06.036 --> 13:07.705
Okay. Hey, Ronnie.
What's wrong?

13:07.913 --> 13:12.001
What's wrong, Archie,
besides the fact that you have
no integrity whatsoever,

13:12.209 --> 13:15.087
is that your father
kissed my mother.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.506
Um...

13:18.132 --> 13:20.760
- Maybe I should leave.
- No, hold on. Hold on.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.595
When my dad told me
how he felt,

13:22.803 --> 13:24.472
it seemed like they were both
really into each other.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.224
They're married
to other people.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.351
Hey, my mom and dad are
separated and your dad is...

13:29.560 --> 13:31.687
My dad is what?

13:32.563 --> 13:35.191
He's...
He's incarcerated, right?

13:35.399 --> 13:37.067
That is so not the point,
Archie!

13:37.276 --> 13:39.195
Of course not. Of course not.
I'm sorry. You're right.

13:39.403 --> 13:42.114
Do you wanna talk about it?
We can go somewhere and talk.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.366
Or do you want your part back?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.619
Oh, don't do me any favors,
Archie.

13:46.827 --> 13:47.703
Veronica...

13:52.958 --> 13:55.211
Your hunt for a new Pussycat
is over.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.254
I can sing, and I've got
a lot of aggression

13:57.463 --> 13:59.215
that needs channeling
into something positive.

14:49.807 --> 14:50.808
Hey.

14:51.851 --> 14:56.397
Don't judge
a home for troubled youths
by its facade, right?

15:01.819 --> 15:03.362
Hi. My name is
Elizabeth Cooper.

15:03.571 --> 15:04.738
I'm here to see
my sister, Polly.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.408
May I see some identification?

15:11.871 --> 15:13.289
Sign in here, please.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.082
He'll have to wait.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.169
Polly's room
is right this way.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.964
Though right now
it's silent reflection time,

15:22.172 --> 15:25.676
and she usually spends
that time in the Garden
of Deliverance.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.912
Polly?

15:55.331 --> 15:58.459
Betty. Oh, my God.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.298
You found us.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.217
You're...

16:17.144 --> 16:19.772
Polly... You're...

16:21.190 --> 16:22.524
With Jason's...

16:23.567 --> 16:27.154
- Please be happy
for me, Betty.
- I am, Polly.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.115
I'm just...

16:31.575 --> 16:33.661
I am so sorry
I didn't come sooner.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.038
- I should've, but Mom
and Dad... They stopped...
- No.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.623
What did they tell you?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.209
That I was on drugs? Alcohol?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.919
They said you were sick.

16:42.962 --> 16:45.714
That you tried
to hurt yourself.

16:45.923 --> 16:50.052
And they told me you didn't
want to come and see me,
which I knew was a lie.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.056
So, they locked you up
because you're pregnant?

16:54.264 --> 16:56.350
It's because they couldn't
control me, Betty.

16:57.935 --> 17:01.105
Mom and Dad hated
that Jason and I were dating.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.315
They were thrilled
when Jason dumped me.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.069
Jason's parents forced him
to break up with me.

17:07.611 --> 17:10.906
Of course they didn't approve
of a Blossom boy dating
a Cooper girl.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.409
But when I told him
about the baby,

17:14.034 --> 17:15.452
our baby...

17:15.661 --> 17:17.997
Oh, he was so happy,
Betty.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.500
We were gonna run away.
Start our family
in a beautiful place.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.169
So, on July 4th,

17:25.421 --> 17:27.589
<i>I woke up, I packed a bag,</i>

17:27.798 --> 17:29.717
<i>and I went downstairs
to start my new life.</i>

17:29.925 --> 17:31.677
<i>Just like Jason and I
had planned.</i>

17:31.885 --> 17:33.929
<i>We were gonna meet
on the other side
of Sweetwater River.</i>

17:35.305 --> 17:37.558
But Mom and Dad found out
about everything.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.352
<i>When I went downstairs,
there was a woman
I didn't know</i>

17:40.561 --> 17:42.396
<i>sitting at the kitchen table
drinking tea</i>

17:42.604 --> 17:45.649
<i>- with two men behind her.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

17:45.858 --> 17:47.568
<i>They threw me
in the back of a van.</i>

17:48.402 --> 17:50.446
<i>I was screaming.</i>

17:50.654 --> 17:53.490
I don't think I stopped
screaming until I got here,
in this place.

17:56.035 --> 17:57.703
Have you talked to him?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.705
Does he know that I'm here?

18:01.623 --> 18:03.876
- Who, Polly?
- Jason.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.879
If I give him a message,
will you make sure
it gets to him?

18:11.008 --> 18:13.635
- Polly, Jason...
- What does he think happened?

18:13.844 --> 18:16.138
He knows that I'm here
because of Mom and Dad, right?

18:16.346 --> 18:17.473
Polly, you don't understand...

18:17.681 --> 18:19.767
I can fix this, Betty.
I know I can.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.020
You just have to help me
get out of here,
and then I'll go to meet him.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.481
I'll go to the car
on the lost highway
off of Route 40.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.982
"Once you pass the old
maple syrup sign,

18:27.191 --> 18:28.442
"then you'll know
you're almost there."

18:28.650 --> 18:30.986
See? I remember.
I'm packed. We're packed.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.946
We'll go to the farm
just like we planned...

18:33.155 --> 18:34.823
Polly, stop.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.826
What's the matter, Betty?

18:38.035 --> 18:39.703
What? What is it?

18:41.914 --> 18:43.290
Jason...

18:44.541 --> 18:46.460
What?
Did something happen to him?

18:48.504 --> 18:50.214
Something bad?

18:54.093 --> 18:55.302
Oh, my God.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.972
Oh, my God!
I knew it.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.600
He's... He's...

19:02.392 --> 19:04.269
- He's...
- I'm sorry.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.188
I'm sorry, Polly.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.023
Come with me, young lady.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.274
Now.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.031
<i>♪ Ooh</i>

19:17.366 --> 19:19.201

<i>♪ Fallin' free,

19:25.749 --> 19:29.878
Um, sorry, Duchess.
Is our practice interrupting
your texting?

19:30.087 --> 19:32.047
I'm just...
I'm just stressed out about...

19:32.256 --> 19:34.925
Poor little rich girl.
What do you have
to be stressed out about?

19:35.134 --> 19:36.760
We're doing a cover
of a disco song,

19:36.969 --> 19:39.930
and my dad is skipping
Jazz Fest to hear it...

19:40.139 --> 19:42.891
Okay, well, I'm sorry
you have daddy issues,

19:43.100 --> 19:45.894
but at least your father
can be in the same room
with you.

19:46.103 --> 19:49.439
I haven't seen my dad
in three months
because he's in jail.

19:49.648 --> 19:50.774
And my mom is...

19:55.028 --> 19:58.657
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.242
You don't care,
and it's not important.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.956
Veronica.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.627
I'm sorry about your dad.

20:13.213 --> 20:13.922
Thanks.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.194
Are you gonna

20:35.402 --> 20:36.695
Because if I'm gonna be
up there with you,

20:36.904 --> 20:39.198
- we need to be
on the same page.
- Yeah, and we will be, Val.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.076
What's goin' on with you?
You've been in a mood.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.787
It's just...
I'm taking a risk, too.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.122
A big one.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.665
Do you mean
quitting the Pussycats?

20:49.875 --> 20:52.920
I met Josie and Melody
when we were all working
at Power Records.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.922
We used to practice
in the stock room.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.051
I'll never forget the day
Josie came to rehearsal

20:59.259 --> 21:01.470
with a bag of cheap cat ears
from the Halloween Store.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.182
I found my voice with them.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.908
Mom?

21:24.201 --> 21:25.118
What are you doing here?

21:27.329 --> 21:30.540
I pay the Sisters good money.
You think they don't notify me
if Polly gets a visitor?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.807
- Mom?
- Polly...

21:47.015 --> 21:51.311
Jason's dead?
And you didn't tell me?
And you kept me in here?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.854
Baby, it's for your own good.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.524
Ugh! You always say that.
And it's not true!

21:56.024 --> 21:57.317
No! Betty!

21:58.068 --> 21:59.903
I'm gonna get you out of here,
I swear to God.

22:00.112 --> 22:02.114
- I love you, Polly.
- No!

22:16.586 --> 22:19.214
So, Myles, you being
a professional jazz man,

22:19.423 --> 22:20.674
you must be livin'
your dream, right?

22:20.882 --> 22:22.968
Well, yes and no.

22:23.176 --> 22:26.805
The real struggle
is always art versus commerce.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.474
You know, I've never really
been about the big paycheck.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.894
But if we're talking
about the future
and long-term security,

22:33.103 --> 22:36.064
it can't always be about
following your bliss.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.900
Personally, I'm just excited
to see my daughter perform

22:39.109 --> 22:41.069
with the Pussycats
at the Variety Show.

22:41.570 --> 22:42.779
- Oh, yeah.
- I beg your pardon?

22:42.988 --> 22:44.281
When were you
gonna tell me about this?

22:44.489 --> 22:48.618
It just happened, Dad,
and she's...
She's really, really good.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.746
And Val quit.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.706
Or should I say
we were Yoko Ono'd?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.751
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:55.959 --> 22:59.087
That's unfortunate.
She was the real deal.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.673
Gave your act
some much-needed integrity.

23:01.882 --> 23:05.218
Well, I figure as long as
the kids are havin' fun,
that's the point, right?

23:05.427 --> 23:09.306
Except it's more than
just about being fun for us.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.767
- Isn't it, Josephine?
- Josephine?

23:12.559 --> 23:15.562
I didn't know
that was your real name.
After Josephine Baker.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.399
You have no idea
who that is, do you?

23:19.608 --> 23:22.402
- Fred? You wanna get started
on that presentation?
- Yeah.

23:24.154 --> 23:27.574
Polly needed
to hear the truth.
And I did, too.

23:27.783 --> 23:28.742
So?

23:29.743 --> 23:31.912
Did you find
what you were looking for?

23:33.080 --> 23:35.832
To be honest, Dad,
no, I didn't.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.420
You hate the Blossoms.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.758
You hated Jason,
and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.261
That gives you a motive.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.223
"A motive"?
A motive for what?

23:51.431 --> 23:53.016
The night of the drive-in,

23:54.393 --> 23:58.063
did you break
into Sheriff Keller's house
and steal his case files?

23:58.271 --> 24:00.732
- What?
- You weren't at the drive-in.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.985
You weren't with Mom
when she put Ms. Grundy
on trial. Where were you?

24:04.611 --> 24:05.404
Betty,

24:06.446 --> 24:08.698
what do you think I did?

24:11.284 --> 24:14.371
Did you kill Jason Blossom?

24:26.716 --> 24:27.926
Him?

24:29.678 --> 24:35.225
You think that
he killed Jason?
Your father?

24:35.434 --> 24:38.437
- You think that he has
the stomach for that?
- Alice...

24:38.645 --> 24:40.856
I wish he'd killed Jason.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.651
I wish I had after what Jason
did to Polly.

24:45.318 --> 24:49.156
I swear, Elizabeth,
you're sounding crazy
just like your sister.

24:49.364 --> 24:54.536
- Stop staying that, Mom.
She's not crazy...
- She is, Betty.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.329
She...

24:56.496 --> 25:00.709
Okay, she is depressed
and delusional.

25:01.668 --> 25:05.005
Did you actually believe
the story she told you?

25:06.047 --> 25:10.177
About running off
to Never-Never Land
and raising a family?

25:11.470 --> 25:13.180
That's a fantasy, Betty.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.224
I don't believe you.
You don't
have to believe us.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.269
We're your parents.

25:32.157 --> 25:35.243
And with the labor force
coming from Riverdale,
Andrews Construction

25:35.452 --> 25:37.204
would be stimulating
the local economy.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.498
It's a win
for the entire town.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.374
That's it in a nutshell.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.376
Well...

25:43.585 --> 25:45.420
After all that
salt-of-the-earth talk,

25:45.629 --> 25:49.132
I didn't expect you to be
another dollar-chasing
gentrifier.

25:49.341 --> 25:53.803
Myles, Fred Andrews
is a working man
who lives in the real world.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.350
I think Fred's bid
was refreshing.

25:58.934 --> 26:01.853
In fact, I'd like
to award him the contract.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.483
I'd like to, Fred,
but the buyer's
already in the process

26:06.691 --> 26:08.151
of accepting another bid.

26:08.318 --> 26:11.947
It would take two
shareholder signatures
to stop the process.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.454
Pop music isn't jazz.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.957
Beyonce
is not Josephine Baker.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.459
- It's an impossible target
to hit, and I keep trying...
- Right...

26:24.668 --> 26:26.086
...but he just... I'm...

26:27.045 --> 26:29.881
Anyway, what's your sob story?

26:30.549 --> 26:32.259
Nothing so glamorous.

26:33.385 --> 26:38.431
I caught my mom
and Fred Andrews
in an intimate moment.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.183
Are you gonna tell your dad?

26:41.101 --> 26:45.146
Josie, the only thing
that keeps me going right now

26:45.355 --> 26:47.566
is the thought of how,
when he gets out of jail,

26:47.774 --> 26:51.695
we can all be together again.
And we can go back
to the way things were.

26:51.903 --> 26:54.739
- Mmm.
- And If I tell my dad
about my mom,

26:54.948 --> 26:57.117
that just all goes away.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.663
Maybe. Maybe not.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.583
- You don't know my father...
- Yeah, but I know
dysfunctional families.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.503
I'm not sayin'
that what your mom's
doing is right,

27:08.962 --> 27:12.799
but maybe there's another side
to the story.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.553
- Hmm?
- Maybe one worth hearing?

27:19.014 --> 27:23.310
Dad, if I tank at the Variety
Show, would you...

27:23.518 --> 27:24.978
Would I be mad?

27:25.812 --> 27:30.567
Son, whatever happens
at that show, or any show,

27:30.775 --> 27:32.402
whether you go
up there and kill it

27:32.611 --> 27:35.155
or you bomb
like electric Dylan
at a folk concert...

27:36.281 --> 27:37.907
I'm not sure who that is.

27:39.784 --> 27:42.787
I would still love you, okay?

27:42.996 --> 27:44.039
Support you.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.708
I'd be proud of the fact
that you were brave enough

27:46.916 --> 27:48.960
to go after somethin'
that you care about.

27:59.638 --> 28:02.390
I can't wait to see your debut
as a Pussycat, Ronnie.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.225
- Mom, I've been thinking...
- Truly.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.853
Meanwhile, I was wondering
if you could help me
with something.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.898
- Are those divorce papers?
- No.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.650
Ronnie, it's a motion.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.193
To award
the construction contract

28:13.360 --> 28:14.986
on your father's land
to Fred Andrews.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.572
I know you're not
his biggest fan right now,

28:17.781 --> 28:20.325
but I was hoping
you would sign it.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.535
Why would I need to sign it?

28:24.996 --> 28:30.377
When your father was arrested,
we made you a legal officer
of Lodge Industries.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.462
Surprise!

28:32.671 --> 28:35.924
And two out of three
signatures are needed
to award the contract,

28:36.132 --> 28:39.260
which your father
wants to give
to a less than legit outfit.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.472
And you want my help
giving it to your boyfriend.

28:45.183 --> 28:46.976
I was gonna apologize to you.

28:49.896 --> 28:53.441
If I sign that, will you stop
seeing Fred Andrews?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.611
Ronnie, I can't agree to that.

28:59.364 --> 29:03.034
In that case, Mom,
I'm sorry, but no.

29:03.243 --> 29:06.121
However you're rationalizing
what you're doing
with Archie's dad,

29:06.329 --> 29:07.747
I don't want any part of it.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.196
It's so perfect
when you play it.

29:40.405 --> 29:41.573
We wrote a good song, Archie.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.953
I can't wait to sing it
with you in public.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.456
But just not tonight.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.833
Val, you should play
with the Pussycats.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.960
I don't want to be the guy
that broke up The Beatles.

29:55.128 --> 29:57.297
In your heart,
you're a Pussycat.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.175
You'll always be a Pussycat.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.177
Maybe.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.140
But singing backup
with no vote, no agency...

30:07.348 --> 30:09.392
- Well, after meeting
Josie's dad...
- Myles is in town?

30:09.601 --> 30:12.604
- Yeah.
- That's why she's been acting
like Catzilla.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.314
I'm betting you can negotiate
new terms.

30:14.522 --> 30:15.648
Where does that leave you?

30:16.775 --> 30:20.862
I was born alone.
I'll die alone.
I'll sing alone.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.280
I'll be okay.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.842
Hey there, Juliet.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.260
Nurse off duty?

30:45.303 --> 30:48.723
You haven't gone full
<i>Yellow Wallpaper</i> on me yet,
have you?

30:51.142 --> 30:52.268
They're crazy.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.938
My parents are crazy.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.940
They're parents.
They're all crazy.

30:57.148 --> 30:59.943
No, but what if...
What if Polly is, too?

31:00.151 --> 31:04.864
The way she was talking to me,
the way she looked at me...

31:05.073 --> 31:08.117
And now, all I can think is,
"Maybe I'm crazy
like they are."

31:08.326 --> 31:09.869
Hey.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.454
We're all crazy.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.750
We're not our parents, Betty.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.878
We're not our families.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.341
Also...

31:25.218 --> 31:26.427
What?

31:30.181 --> 31:31.432
What?

31:46.114 --> 31:48.283
The car.

31:48.491 --> 31:51.995
Wow. That's what you're
thinking about in the middle
of our moment?

31:52.203 --> 31:56.207
No! Polly talked about a car
Jason had stashed for them

31:56.416 --> 31:59.460
down Route 40 near some sign.

31:59.669 --> 32:03.131
If we can find it,
we can confirm Polly's story.

32:03.715 --> 32:05.008
One way or another.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.177
I need to know, Juggy.

32:09.971 --> 32:14.142
<i>Hello, Riverdale High,
and welcome to the 75th
annual Variety Show!</i>

32:20.899 --> 32:22.567
Why didn't you tell me
your dad was coming?

32:23.318 --> 32:24.819
Would it have
made a difference?

32:25.028 --> 32:27.614
Um, yes.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.949
Josie, I'm not singing
with Archie tonight.

32:31.701 --> 32:35.663
Sorry to hear that,
but you know I filled
your spot, Val.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.082
Yes...

32:39.834 --> 32:43.004
And I also know the new girl
may be pretty,

32:44.088 --> 32:47.508
but no way does
her voice blend with yours
like mine does.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.515
I suppose...

32:56.559 --> 32:59.562
There's always room for one
more kitty in my litter box.

32:59.771 --> 33:01.481
- But Josie...
- Yeah?

33:01.689 --> 33:03.191
Every now and then,
I want to sing lead.

33:04.442 --> 33:07.654
Co-lead.
And only on the bridge.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.030
Fine.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.034
I have this killer arrangement
