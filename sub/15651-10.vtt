11:54.463 --> 11:56.132
YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.299
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:57.383 --> 11:59.343
(<i> all but Rocko laughing</i> )

11:59.427 --> 12:04.098
(<i> Heffer laughing wildly</i> )

12:08.227 --> 12:10.980
X-RAY SPECS.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.734
(<i> all screaming</i> )

12:15.818 --> 12:17.194
(<i> laughing hysterically</i> )

12:17.278 --> 12:20.114
I CAN SEE YOU!

12:22.658 --> 12:24.743
I CAN SEE ALL OF YOU!

12:37.006 --> 12:38.132
(<i> gunning engine</i> )

12:38.215 --> 12:40.968
(<i> growling</i> )

12:46.390 --> 12:49.185
(<i> screaming</i> )

12:49.268 --> 12:51.562
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.565
SPEEDING HEADLONG
TOWARDS CERTAIN DESTRUCTION

12:54.648 --> 12:56.650
WITH HEFF'S MOM AT THE WHEEL.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.695
HOW DID I GET INTO
THIS IMPROBABLE SITUATION?

12:59.778 --> 13:01.822
IT ALL STARTED A FEW DAYS AGO.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.451
YOU SEE, HEFF'S DAD
HAD FINALLY BOUGHT A NEW CAR.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.369
IT'S SMOOTH, IT'S SPORTY.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.205
IT HANDLES LIKE A CHARM.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.083
{\an1}I TELL YOU, THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE OWNING A NEW CAR.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.462
YEAH, EXCEPT
MAYBE DRIVING IT.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.507
ARE YOU NUTS? SHE COULD
GET SCRATCHED OR DENTED.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.092
{\an1}SHE'S FINE RIGHT HERE
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.386
YEAH, VIRGINIA, THIS IS
ONE FINE AUTOMOBILE.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.097
IT CERTAINLY IS, DEAR.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.229
GEORGE, DEAR.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.688
YEAH?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.774
WELL, THE KIDS AND I
WERE JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW

13:36.857 --> 13:40.236
THAT WE HAD THE CAR
FOR THREE MONTHS NOW

13:40.319 --> 13:42.696
{\an1}AND WE WERE WONDERING
WHEN WE MIGHT...

13:42.780 --> 13:43.906
WHAT? WHAT? SPIT IT OUT.

13:43.989 --> 13:48.202
WHEN CAN WE TAKE
THE CAR OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY?

13:48.285 --> 13:50.579
DIDN'T I GET YOU ALL
BUS SCHEDULES?

13:50.663 --> 13:54.250
{\an1}BUT PART OF THE FUN OF HAVING
A NEW CAR IS DRIVING IT.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.795
YEAH, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A FAMILY CAR.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.047
I WANT TO DRIVE IT
TO ROCKO'S HOUSE.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.424
I COULD DRIVE IT
TO MY POETRY READINGS.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.842
{\an5}I WANT TO DRIVE, TOO.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.095
YEAH, RIGHT, GRANDPA.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.722
I'LL STEER WITH MY GUMS.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.391
TO BE HONEST,
IT'S SUCH A NICE CAR

14:10.474 --> 14:13.269
I'D LIKE TO DRIVE IT MYSELF.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.937
{\an1}YOU, MOM?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.855
YOU CAN'T EVEN DRIVE.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.566
WELL, I CAN LEARN.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.694
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
LEARNING IN MY CAR.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.280
NO ONE IS DRIVING THAT CAR!

14:26.365 --> 14:30.494
{\an1}AND JUST TO MAKE SURE,
I AM PUTTING THE KEY HERE.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.497
(<i> beeping</i> )

14:33.581 --> 14:37.042
NOW NO ONE CAN DRIVE IT.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.836
(<i> cackling</i> )

14:38.919 --> 14:41.130
{\an1}GEORGE,
WHEN DID YOU BUILD THIS?

14:41.213 --> 14:42.965
LAST NIGHT.
YOU LIKE IT?

14:43.048 --> 14:45.551
DAD'S GOT
TOO MUCH FREE TIME.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.053
IT'S BLOCKING THE TV.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.854
HI, MRS. WOLFE.
IS HEFF HERE?

14:56.937 --> 14:57.980
NO, SORRY, ROCKO.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.941
{\an1}GEORGE TOOK HEFF
AND THE KIDS OUT TODAY.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.610
SAY, ROCKO, YOU GOT A CAR.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.695
COULD YOU DRIVE ME TO THE STORE?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.739
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE NEW CAR?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.867
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I'M AFRAID
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.952
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I COULD TEACH YOU.

15:15.789 --> 15:16.540
WHEN DO WE START?

15:16.624 --> 15:20.502
WELL, NOW, I GUESS.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.506
MRS. WOLFE

15:24.590 --> 15:26.383
FIRST WE'RE
GOING TO TRY

15:26.467 --> 15:28.886
DRIVING AROUND
THESE LIGHT POLES.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.686
YOU SEE? THAT WAS EASY.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.355
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.070
(<i> crashing</i> )

15:46.153 --> 15:47.404
DON'T WORRY, ROCKO, I'M FINE.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.698
I'LL JUST BACK UP.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.367
(<i> whimpering</i> )

15:51.450 --> 15:52.785
AH...

15:54.453 --> 15:57.206
(<i> crashing</i> )

15:57.289 --> 15:58.999
THERE.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.668
(<i> laughing</i>
<i>nervously</i> )

16:00.751 --> 16:04.046
{\an1}I THINK PERHAPS
WE SHOULD WEAR THESE.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.049
{\an1}OKAY, IT'S TIME
TO GET BACK IN TRAFFIC NOW.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.550
SLOWLY...

16:08.634 --> 16:09.718
{\an3}WAIT...

16:09.802 --> 16:10.469
WAIT...

16:10.552 --> 16:13.347
(<i> screaming</i> )

16:18.102 --> 16:21.063
NOW LET'S TRY PARALLEL PARKING.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.314
OOPS.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.070
YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
IN DRIVE, MRS. WOLFE.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.533
NOW, PUT IT IN REVERSE.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.160
{\an1}OKAY, OKAY,
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.874
NOW, JUST EASE TO THE LEFT

16:42.292 --> 16:43.752
THERE, HOW'S THAT?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.130
WELL, UH, WE ARE IN THE SPACE.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.593
{\an1}NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO READ
ALL THE SIGNS YOU SEE.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.554
LIKE THIS ONE, FOR INSTANCE.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.180
"SLOW CHILDREN PLAYING."

17:02.396 --> 17:03.814
WHAT ABOUT SIGNS
WITHOUT WORDS?

17:03.897 --> 17:06.983
{\an1}MOST OF THEM
ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.318
THIS ONE IS, UM

17:08.402 --> 17:10.279
UH, MMM...

17:10.362 --> 17:12.281
I'M NOT SURE.

17:14.282 --> 17:17.077
OH, IT'S A CHEESE CROSSING.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.494
IT'S ALL CLEAR NOW.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.124
(<i> clanking</i> )

17:25.836 --> 17:27.796
A TRAIN CROSSING,
MRS. WOLFE.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.630
STOP! HIT THE BRAKES!

17:28.714 --> 17:30.716
BRAKES, LET'S SEE.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.634
THERE, THAT'S ONE
OF THESE PEDALS, RIGHT?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.845
AH, HERE IT IS. THERE.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.389
THAT WAS A NICE, SMOOTH
STOP, WASN'T IT?

17:37.473 --> 17:38.807
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

17:38.891 --> 17:41.143
DON'T STOP ON THE TRACKS!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.060
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.397
WHEN YOU TELL AT ME,
I GET ALL FLUSTERED.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.941
TRAIN IS COMING!

17:48.025 --> 17:50.110
WELL, WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE

17:50.194 --> 17:52.070
TILL YOU
CHANGE YOUR TONE.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.697
OKAY.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.451
COULD YOU PLEASE...

18:00.954 --> 18:04.458
Mrs. Wolfe:
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

18:04.541 --> 18:06.710
WE WERE WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.546
{\an1}ALL IN ALL, I THINK YOUR CAR
FARED PRETTY WELL.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.299
{\an1}YOU MAY WANT TO GET THE BUMPER
STRAIGHTENED OUT, THOUGH.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.437
WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER
START WALKING HOME NOW.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.731
OH, DON'T BE SILLY,
I'LL DRIVE YOU.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.988
WE'LL TAKE THE NEW CAR.

18:35.072 --> 18:39.117
{\an5}THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE DRIVING
LESSON, ROCKO.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.787
I'M MUCH MORE
CONFIDENT NOW.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.165
YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.587
{\an1}DON'T WORRY, ROCKO,
WE'LL GET YOU HOME EARLY.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.096
{\an1}WELL, HERE'S
MY EXIT COMING UP.

{\an1}DON'T WORRY, ROCKO,
WE'LL CATCH THE NEXT ONE.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.359
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

19:12.442 --> 19:16.196
WELCOME TO THE DEMOLITION DERBY.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.949
YEAH, LET'S SEE SOME SMASHING.

YEAH, MY NEW CAR'S A BEAUT.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.917
OH, DEAR,
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.752
LET'S SEE, WE TOOK THIS EXIT

19:30.836 --> 19:33.130
THEN WE SHOULD TURN HERE--

OH, WAIT,
THAT'S A COFFEE STAIN.

19:35.299 --> 19:39.261
HEY, SOMEONE'S BROUGHT
A NEW CAR TO THE DERBY.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.345
ALL RIGHT!

19:40.429 --> 19:42.598
I KNOW WHAT CAR
I'M SMASHING FIRST.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.558
SHINY METAL.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.727

IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY

19:51.857 --> 19:53.942
BROUGHT IN
A BRAND-NEW CAR TODAY.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.362

SEE A CAR THIS NICE?

19:57.446 --> 19:58.864
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.661
{\an1}ALL RIGHT!

20:17.382 --> 20:19.718
DON'T WORRY, ROCKO,

I'M GOING TO SMASH YOU, LADY.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.144
NOW, THAT'S
JUST DARN RUDE.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.021
LOOK OUT!

{\an1}THIS IS MY FIRST DAY DRIVING,
AND I KNOW I'M NOT PERFECT

20:45.661 --> 20:46.495
BUT I THINK I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.497
MRS. WOLFE?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.831
PLEASE.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.417
OKAY, BECAUSE YOU ASKED NICE.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.838
WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.591
IT'S VERY ARTISTIC.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.467
{\an3}WHOOPS.

21:00.550 --> 21:04.638
{\an1}WE MUST BE HEADED
THE WRONG WAY AGAIN.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.807
THIS TRAFFIC'S HORRIBLE.

21:11.269 --> 21:14.147

A NARROW ESCAPE BY THE NEW CAR

21:14.231 --> 21:16.066
BUT HOW LONG CAN IT HOLD OUT?

21:16.149 --> 21:18.860
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SAY THOSE CARS

21:18.944 --> 21:21.822
ARE FOLLOWING US.

21:29.663 --> 21:33.875

Mrs. Wolfe:
IT'S RAINING CARS.

HOW STRANGE.

ALL THE OTHER CARS.

ALL THE CARS EXCEPT FOR

22:11.830 --> 22:14.958
THE THRASHER.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.969
WELL, VIRGINIA, I MUST SAY

23:08.053 --> 23:11.306
THAT WAS SOME
PRETTY FANCY DRIVING.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.809
{\an1}Mrs. Wolfe:
WELL, I HAD A GOOD TEACHER.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.812

23:16.895 --> 23:20.899
YEAH, SHE'S ONE FINE AUTOMOBILE.

CAN WE DRIVE IT NOW?

NO!

23:25.862 --> 23:27.864
