Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.808 --> 00:05.219
To get home, we'll
harness the power

00:05.220 --> 00:07.192
of the eclipse using
a mystical relic.

00:07.193 --> 00:08.048
Elena: What
about Bonnie?

00:08.050 --> 00:09.818
Damon: She sacrificed
herself so I could come back.

00:09.820 --> 00:11.895
Where did you
put your magic?

00:11.896 --> 00:14.031
I put it
somewhere safe?

00:14.033 --> 00:15.568
I hate you because
if I don't hate you

00:15.570 --> 00:17.001
then I have
to hate myself,

00:17.003 --> 00:18.537
and I deserve better
than that.

00:18.539 --> 00:19.778
Enzo: She hates because
she's got a thing

00:19.780 --> 00:21.211
for you, mate.

00:21.213 --> 00:22.779
Liam: I got a look
at Lady Whitmore's labs.

00:22.781 --> 00:24.980
It turns out the injury
doesn't exist anymore.

00:24.982 --> 00:28.422
You're not just a liar,
but you're a liar with secrets.

00:28.424 --> 00:29.559
I'm older than you.

By 5 minutes.

Just trying to check
what page we're on.

Luke: When the coven
calls us home,

00:34.563 --> 00:36.297
they don't care if
we're in love or not.

00:36.299 --> 00:39.602
You sound like dad, and that's
not a compliment.

Where are they, Jo?

01:39.155 --> 01:42.322
Hey. Everything's
gonna be ok, all right?

01:42.324 --> 01:45.426
Everybody's just
playing a game.

01:45.428 --> 01:47.194
You guys want
to play a game?

01:47.196 --> 01:48.666
You want to play
hide-and-seek?

01:48.668 --> 01:50.634
Shh. Ok.

01:55.909 --> 01:58.340
Come on out, Jo.

01:58.342 --> 01:59.940
You know I won't
kill you.

03:04.253 --> 03:05.882
Wakey, wakey.

03:07.756 --> 03:09.185
Come here.

03:12.428 --> 03:13.722
Ohh.

03:13.724 --> 03:14.962
How did I...

03:14.964 --> 03:16.331
Get so lucky
to arrive here

03:16.333 --> 03:17.899
on a private flight
piloted by yours truly?

03:17.901 --> 03:19.731
Oh, you would have been
superimpressed

03:19.733 --> 03:21.067
with my flying skills,
but I'd already knocked you out

03:21.069 --> 03:22.531
with painkillers.

03:25.776 --> 03:27.008
Where are we?

03:27.010 --> 03:28.744
Portland, Oregon,
stomping grounds

03:28.746 --> 03:30.712
of Courtney Love,
Tonya Harding,

03:30.714 --> 03:32.320
and tons of other
awesome people.

03:32.322 --> 03:33.649
You could have
brought me anywhere

03:33.651 --> 03:36.152
in the world,
and you took me to Portland?

03:36.154 --> 03:37.392
This is where
I grew up.

03:37.394 --> 03:38.792
Ow!

03:38.794 --> 03:40.760
I've been counting
eclipses since I was

03:40.762 --> 03:43.329
imprisoned
on this empty planet,

03:43.331 --> 03:45.433
and according to my
running tally, I've been here

03:45.435 --> 03:49.737
for 6,771 supernaturally
repeating days,

03:49.739 --> 03:52.240
so in the real world, which we'll never
get back to because

03:52.242 --> 03:54.936
you sent your magic away
in a Teddy bear,

03:54.938 --> 03:57.104
today's my favorite day
of the year.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.543
And what day is that?

03:59.545 --> 04:01.047
Thanksgiving.

04:02.785 --> 04:04.551
I'm cooking
you dinner.

04:09.723 --> 04:11.856
[Music playing]

04:14.258 --> 04:16.360
I'm a vampire.

04:16.362 --> 04:18.832
I don't know. Maybe
a little less emphasis on vampire.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.064
I'm...A vampire.

04:23.234 --> 04:26.767
I mean, there's only
so many ways you can say it.

04:26.769 --> 04:28.303
Well, maybe Liam
will stop digging

04:28.305 --> 04:30.007
into Lady Whitmore's
miraculous recovery,

04:30.009 --> 04:31.638
and you won't
have to complain.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.046
Or he'll keep digging,
realize that I force-fed

04:33.048 --> 04:35.447
her my vampire blood,
and then just bail.

04:35.449 --> 04:38.919
Ok. You know all of this
can go away with one fell mind wipe.

04:38.921 --> 04:43.791
So lie and lie again
and again and again.

04:43.793 --> 04:45.287
Ok. If you want to
tell him the truth,

04:45.289 --> 04:47.527
I support you 100%,

04:47.529 --> 04:48.823
but if you're rushing
into this to escape

04:48.825 --> 04:51.599
some conflicted feelings
over a certain ex

04:51.601 --> 04:53.127
who just came back
into your life,

04:53.129 --> 04:57.566
then I suggest
you keep your fangs to yourself.

04:57.568 --> 04:59.006
-Jo.
-Hi.

don't kill
the messenger.

05:01.671 --> 05:04.476
Something about
an impromptu guys' weekend.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.107
You can't miss
friendsgiving.

05:06.109 --> 05:07.938
I mean, Matt and Jeremy
are already cleaning up

05:07.940 --> 05:10.809
the whole Tripp mess,
and Caroline's mom has to work.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.681
We're already low
on friends as it is.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.080
Well, if it's
any consolation,

05:14.082 --> 05:15.776
our Thanksgiving was
roadside chili.

05:15.778 --> 05:18.615
Hey. Were you invited
to friendsgiving?

05:18.617 --> 05:21.614
Of course. Caroline
demanded I bring string beans.

05:21.616 --> 05:22.822
Huh.

05:22.824 --> 05:24.022
Why? Were you
not invited?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.886
- Nope.
- Ooh, boy.

05:25.888 --> 05:28.525
You messed with the wrong girl's
feelings. Heh heh.

05:28.527 --> 05:29.957
Elena: What do you
mean Bonnie's

05:29.959 --> 05:31.460
in the prison world?

05:31.462 --> 05:32.492
Damon said that
she wasn't there,

05:32.494 --> 05:36.428
that she found peace
with--

05:36.430 --> 05:37.900
why didn't he tell
me this?

05:37.902 --> 05:39.300
Why wouldn't I consult
you in a decision that

05:39.302 --> 05:41.068
might permanently
change your life?

05:41.070 --> 05:43.540
Hmm. I wonder.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.276
He didn't want to
get your hopes up.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.612
He honestly thought
Bonnie died trying to free him.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.044
If she sent her
Teddy bear over,

05:49.046 --> 05:50.612
it could mean
she's still--

05:50.614 --> 05:51.715
Bonnie's still alive?

05:51.717 --> 05:53.012
Oh, my god!

05:53.014 --> 05:54.316
Yeah. So we're in
Portland right now,

05:54.318 --> 05:57.251
trying to track down
some Gemini thing.

Ascendant.

05:58.653 --> 06:00.283
This is amazing.

06:00.285 --> 06:01.691
Alaric, you might want to keep
the news to yourself.

06:01.693 --> 06:02.722
I checked this
lead 4 months ago.

06:02.724 --> 06:05.554
It was a dead end.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.330

his love.

06:07.332 --> 06:08.898
Wait. What--

06:16.774 --> 06:19.344
Bonnie's alive?

06:19.346 --> 06:20.978
Hee hee!

06:23.589 --> 06:25.726
Alaric: Is that the reason
Caroline assigned me

06:25.728 --> 06:28.896
the turkey and the Cranberries?
Stefan wasn't invited.

06:28.898 --> 06:30.465
See what you did?
Now we're pulling your weight.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.402
I really hope you
figure this out before Christmas.

06:32.404 --> 06:34.706
Yeah. Well, I'm glad
you're both finding amusement in this.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.835
Why don't you
just date her,

06:35.837 --> 06:37.770
put us all out
of our misery?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.170
Because I don't think
about her that way. She's my friend.

06:39.172 --> 06:40.442
Who would make
a great girlfriend.

06:40.444 --> 06:42.746
Look. One, she's
hot objectively.

06:42.748 --> 06:44.409
Two, she puts
up with you.

06:44.411 --> 06:46.913
Big plus. 3, very,
very well organized.

06:46.915 --> 06:48.353
Organizational
skills?

06:48.355 --> 06:50.448
There are no drawbacks
to this woman, Stefan.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.488
Eh, she did
sleep with you.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.087
See? Another plus.

06:54.089 --> 06:56.959
Oh! Look.
We're here.

06:56.961 --> 07:00.623
Behold the Gemini coven
exactly how it looked

chanting in the air,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.550
mom and dad calling me
an abomination.

07:29.552 --> 07:31.581
Why did you want
to come back here?

07:31.583 --> 07:33.453
Because I can finally
show it to someone.

07:33.455 --> 07:35.021
My coven goes out
of their way to make sure

07:35.023 --> 07:38.117
no one finds us,
but since they're not here

07:38.119 --> 07:40.861
to be paranoid
freak shows,

07:40.863 --> 07:44.525
mi casa es su casa.

07:44.527 --> 07:45.965
Come on.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.606
Like I said, uh,
3,000 miles ago,

07:52.608 --> 07:53.838
it's not here.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.102
Can we, uh, go
home now, please?

07:55.104 --> 07:56.806
You know what?
Check the GPS again.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.046
Just because we
don't see anything doesn't

07:58.048 --> 07:59.542
mean it doesn't
exist.

07:59.544 --> 08:02.582
Not unlike Caroline's
feelings for Stefan.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.717
Hilarious.
Keep them coming.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.914
[High voice] Oh, no. Is Stefan
feeling sensitive

08:06.916 --> 08:09.314
about ruining
his friendship with Caroline?

08:09.316 --> 08:12.020
She really liked him,
and he broke her heart.

08:12.022 --> 08:13.692
See, Stefan?

08:13.694 --> 08:14.988
Even the bear knew.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.724
I saw that
from a mile away,

08:16.726 --> 08:18.860
and my brain's made
of cotton.

08:18.862 --> 08:20.132
Give me this.

You look--have
we met before?

09:05.481 --> 09:06.983

but you're dating

09:06.985 --> 09:08.319
my occult
studies Professor,

09:08.321 --> 09:10.120
which I guess
somehow earned you

09:10.122 --> 09:13.223
an invite for
Thanksgiving dinner.

09:13.225 --> 09:15.055
Nice to meet you, too.

09:18.498 --> 09:20.096
Where's Luke?

09:20.098 --> 09:21.736
He's outside testing
a new filter on his phone.

09:21.738 --> 09:23.865
He's making me
this stupid retrospective video

09:23.867 --> 09:25.473
for our birthday.

09:25.475 --> 09:28.505

09:31.011 --> 09:32.977

What's with her?

09:35.546 --> 09:38.216
Liam, hey.
You're here.

09:38.218 --> 09:40.488
Bearing the white wine
of surrender.

09:40.490 --> 09:42.289
I owe you an apology.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.321
I checked Lady Whitmore's
medical records again,

09:44.323 --> 09:45.857
and everything
was normal,

09:45.859 --> 09:47.697
which I would have known
if I had double-checked

09:47.699 --> 09:49.193
them before making
accusations that

09:49.195 --> 09:54.032
were unfounded,
baseless, dickish.

09:54.034 --> 09:55.704
Is that enough
adjectives?

09:55.706 --> 09:58.240
Getting there.

09:58.242 --> 10:01.840

10:01.842 --> 10:03.208
You, too, Liam.

10:06.378 --> 10:07.913
Come on.

10:09.451 --> 10:10.585
Would you mind?

10:10.587 --> 10:13.848
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

10:13.850 --> 10:17.025
Hey. Um, did you...

risk my career switching

medical chart?

10:20.930 --> 10:23.096
I'm glad it worked.

10:23.098 --> 10:25.832
Yeah. Thank you.

[Doorbell rings]

Stefan: Anybody want
to take a stab at how

10:34.903 --> 10:37.340
Bonnie's Teddy bear undid
whatever was cloaking this place?

10:37.342 --> 10:38.836
He said
without laughing.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.412
Jo told me she
got rid of her magic

10:40.414 --> 10:45.244
by putting it away
for safekeeping.

10:45.246 --> 10:47.781
Maybe Bonnie put her
magic away in this.

10:47.783 --> 10:52.524
Why would Bonnie put her
magic in Ms. Cuddles?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.956
To keep Kai from
using her to get out.

11:02.465 --> 11:06.071
Can't say
I miss that.

11:06.073 --> 11:07.775
It's all yours,
brother.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.598
[Music playing]

11:34.032 --> 11:36.165
That smells great.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.965
Not exactly
a turkey dinner,

11:37.967 --> 11:44.005
but it's what my family
had in the fridge on May 10, 1994.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.309
Don't touch that.

11:45.311 --> 11:48.180
Heh. Your pager?
Why?

11:48.182 --> 11:51.116
Because it's brand-new,
looks cool,

11:51.118 --> 11:53.316
and I don't want you
to bust it.

11:55.588 --> 11:57.850
Listen, Kai.
My magic's gone,

11:57.852 --> 12:00.858
which means we will be
stuck here forever.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.858
Why don't we just divide
the world in half

12:02.860 --> 12:04.026
and go
our separate ways?

12:04.028 --> 12:05.258
I get it.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.394
I knocked you out,
kidnapped you

against your will.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.027
You don't see I'm
trying to apologize?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.363
I will never trust you

12:10.365 --> 12:12.331
or like you or enjoy
your company

12:12.333 --> 12:13.667
for so much
as one second,

12:13.669 --> 12:15.436
so just quit trying.

12:15.438 --> 12:19.014
Just let me leave
here unharmed.

12:19.016 --> 12:22.782
Fine. Can we at least
have one last dinner conversation

12:22.784 --> 12:25.214
before my eternity
of aloneness resumes?

12:25.216 --> 12:26.453
So you agree?

12:26.455 --> 12:30.221
One last dinner,
and then we peacefully

12:30.223 --> 12:32.821
go our separate ways.

12:32.823 --> 12:35.223
In the spirit of Thanksgiving,
I'll even let you take my car.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.965
How can I help?

12:41.735 --> 12:43.733
All right!
If everyone could gather

12:43.735 --> 12:45.933
around the table
at their assigned seats,

12:45.935 --> 12:47.101
then, um--

12:47.103 --> 12:49.972
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

12:49.974 --> 12:52.211
We will each share
something that we are

12:52.213 --> 12:56.212
thankful for
in 100 words or less, so...

12:56.214 --> 12:58.283
Do you want a drink?

12:58.285 --> 13:00.115
Once we sit, there's
a good chance Caroline

13:00.117 --> 13:01.587
won't let anyone get up.

13:01.589 --> 13:03.554
I'm not really
in the mood.

13:03.556 --> 13:05.522
Did I do something
to piss you off?

13:05.524 --> 13:09.954
No, Tyler.
You didn't.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.026
Luke: Uh, anyone want to see
some embarrassing baby videos of Liv?

13:14.028 --> 13:15.562
Oh. You know what?
Now would actually be

13:15.564 --> 13:17.298
an excellent time just to
shut down anything

13:17.300 --> 13:20.170
with an on-off button.

13:20.172 --> 13:21.770
Young Jo: Whoever wins
has to make...

13:21.772 --> 13:23.234
Caroline: No. Please let
the food get cold.

13:23.236 --> 13:27.442
Whatever that is
is far more important.

13:27.444 --> 13:30.043
Young Jo: Happy Birthday!
Wave to me!

13:30.045 --> 13:32.516
- Hi, Josie.
- Hi, Josie.

13:32.518 --> 13:33.820
Young Jo:
How old are you?

13:33.822 --> 13:34.916
Twins: 4.

13:34.918 --> 13:36.084
How do you add that?

13:36.086 --> 13:37.788
You guys want to
do some numbers?

13:37.790 --> 13:39.420
Ok. What's one plus one?

13:39.422 --> 13:40.556
Two!

13:40.558 --> 13:41.724
Two plus two?

13:41.726 --> 13:42.795
- 4!
- Nice.

13:42.797 --> 13:44.227
What are you watching?

13:44.229 --> 13:46.563
Elena: That kind of
sounds like your voice.

13:46.565 --> 13:48.363
That is my voice.

13:50.933 --> 13:53.538
I took that video
18 years ago

13:53.540 --> 13:55.802
at a birthday party
for the twins.

13:55.804 --> 13:57.338
Oh, my god.

14:00.613 --> 14:03.243
Lukas and Olivia?

14:03.245 --> 14:05.915
Jo as in josette?

14:05.917 --> 14:09.987
Elena: Hang on.
You guys know each other?

14:09.989 --> 14:11.587
I'm their sister.

14:17.796 --> 14:19.498
Alaric: Jo lived here.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.762
There's a drawer inside
full of stuff,

14:21.764 --> 14:25.170
newspaper articles
about Jo's medical clamp,

14:25.172 --> 14:27.138
pictures
of her as a kid,

14:27.140 --> 14:28.674
pictures of her
as a teenager.

14:28.676 --> 14:31.409
Hold, please. Rewind.

14:31.411 --> 14:33.577
That's Kai
from planet 1994.

14:33.579 --> 14:35.673
Stefan: Wait.
Jo is his sister?

14:35.675 --> 14:37.009
Either that,
or they both have a thing

14:37.011 --> 14:39.049
for Cosby sweaters.

14:39.051 --> 14:42.184
Man: I didn't know
I had guests.

14:42.186 --> 14:43.448
You've met Kai?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.784
Met him?
Watched him die,

14:45.786 --> 14:48.025
watched him
come back to life.

14:48.027 --> 14:50.093
Why? You know him?

14:50.095 --> 14:53.536
Yeah. He's my son.

14:53.538 --> 14:55.506
I'm Joshua Parker.

14:55.508 --> 14:56.706
Damon Salvatore.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.610
Invisique.

14:58.612 --> 14:59.873
What the hell
just happened?

14:59.875 --> 15:01.143
I don't know.

15:02.913 --> 15:04.511
What's wrong
with you guys?

15:04.513 --> 15:07.679
They can't see you
anymore, Damon,

15:07.681 --> 15:09.751
which means they also
can't see this.

15:09.753 --> 15:12.919
Ohh! No!

15:23.644 --> 15:25.259
Caroline: So if you
don't know each other,

15:25.260 --> 15:27.395
then how did you all
just happen to end up

15:27.396 --> 15:29.433
at the same tiny
liberal arts school?

15:30.156 --> 15:33.784
We had a family friend
here--Sheila Bennett.

15:33.786 --> 15:35.424
Elena: You knew
Bonnie's grams?

15:35.426 --> 15:37.159
She took me
under her wing.

15:37.161 --> 15:39.556
Elena: She also helped
my family put Kai away.

15:39.558 --> 15:43.593
Kai? Wh--Kai
as in Damon's Kai?

15:43.595 --> 15:45.688
As in our brother,
my twin.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.758
There are two sets
of twins in your family?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.861
Luke: Yeah, there were until
my coven put Kai in a prison world.

15:50.863 --> 15:52.828
Now there's just
Luke and me.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.299
I'm sorry.
Did you say coven?

15:55.301 --> 15:57.961
Oh, my god.
Liam...

15:57.963 --> 15:58.960
Is still here.

15:58.962 --> 16:01.495
Tyler: I think
he meant oven.

16:01.497 --> 16:02.903
Yeah.

16:02.905 --> 16:03.999
Oh, look! We don't
have a wine opener

16:04.001 --> 16:05.303
on the table.

16:05.305 --> 16:07.071
Liam, you have
a wine opener in your room.

16:07.073 --> 16:09.039
Why don't you get it?

16:09.041 --> 16:11.942
Take your time.

16:11.944 --> 16:14.444
As you were saying,
you put Kai away?

16:14.446 --> 16:16.443
Kai killed 4
of our bothers and sisters

16:16.445 --> 16:18.179
to make a point,
but he was really

16:18.181 --> 16:20.042
targeting
Lukas and Olivia.

16:20.044 --> 16:21.314
Why them?

16:21.316 --> 16:23.881
Because in our coven,
twins are in line

16:23.883 --> 16:25.216
to be leaders.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.215
Hence our lame-ass
name--Gemini.

16:28.217 --> 16:29.654
Kai wanted to be
the leader,

16:29.656 --> 16:30.990
but that wasn't
possible

16:30.992 --> 16:33.220
if Lukas and Olivia
were alive.

16:35.557 --> 16:37.626
So I protected
them with magic.

16:41.891 --> 16:44.729
Which just pissed
him off more.

16:44.731 --> 16:47.201
Where are they?

16:47.203 --> 16:49.833
My brother was born
without his own magic.

16:49.835 --> 16:51.865
He can only draw
it from others.

16:51.867 --> 16:53.641
It made him feel
like a freak.

16:53.643 --> 16:55.305
My parents saw him
acting out,

16:55.307 --> 16:58.177
isolating himself,
and they realized that

16:58.179 --> 17:00.713
he'd never be capable
of leading our coven,

17:00.715 --> 17:02.881
so he kept having children
until another set

17:02.883 --> 17:04.544
of twins were born.

17:04.546 --> 17:05.752
[Whimpers]

17:10.890 --> 17:14.388
Kai figured it out,
and he snapped.

17:14.391 --> 17:16.988
Where are they?

17:18.355 --> 17:19.952
Unh!

17:19.954 --> 17:22.222
Aah!

17:22.223 --> 17:24.354
[Sobbing]

17:32.363 --> 17:33.697
[Moans]

17:36.803 --> 17:40.601
Oh. Ohh.

17:43.907 --> 17:46.410
Just need some
information.

17:46.412 --> 17:48.010
Not looking to
make enemies.

17:48.012 --> 17:50.010
Funny way of showing
it, buddy.

17:50.012 --> 17:51.250
You were trapped
with Kai.

17:51.252 --> 17:53.546
I need to know
how you got out.

17:53.548 --> 17:54.553
Ohh.

17:54.555 --> 17:56.553
Strangest 4 months
of my life.

17:56.555 --> 17:58.257
That whole repeating
the day thing,

17:58.259 --> 18:00.793
phew, disconcerting.

18:00.795 --> 18:02.258
Is Kai still there?

18:02.260 --> 18:04.658
Yeah, he is
with my friend Bonnie,

18:04.660 --> 18:06.562
which leads me
to why I'm here.

18:06.564 --> 18:08.234
Does Kai know
how to escape?

18:10.404 --> 18:12.467
Look. I'll tell you
everything you want to know,

18:12.469 --> 18:15.442
but first, I need
something from you.

18:15.444 --> 18:17.043
It's round,
about yea big,

18:17.045 --> 18:20.443
a bunch of little gears
and wheels and things.

18:20.445 --> 18:21.947
It's a lot harder to
describe than I thought.

18:21.949 --> 18:24.618
The Ascendant.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.587
Yeah. You know it.
Where is it?

18:27.589 --> 18:30.419
Why would I give you
the key to my son's prison?

18:30.421 --> 18:33.722
Because I'll
say please.

18:33.724 --> 18:35.825
Do you have any idea
what it feels like to

18:35.827 --> 18:38.624
come home and find
4 of your children dead,

18:38.626 --> 18:42.494
another one impaled,
two running for their lives?

18:42.496 --> 18:46.332
Do you think that image
has ever left my mind?

18:46.334 --> 18:49.668
He was a psychopath,
so they sent him away.

18:49.670 --> 18:54.403
Kai went to his prison,
Jo dodged a bullet,

18:54.405 --> 18:58.939
and now the leadership
falls on us.

18:58.941 --> 19:01.011
Ok. Well, now that we've
all gotten to know each

19:01.013 --> 19:02.411
other a little bit
better, could someone

19:02.413 --> 19:04.251
please pass
the dinner rolls?

19:04.253 --> 19:05.618
Liv: Sorry that my
family drama isn't

19:05.620 --> 19:07.882
appropriate dinner
conversation, Caroline.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.482
That's not what I meant.

19:09.484 --> 19:11.490
Liv, just...

19:11.492 --> 19:12.986
Leave me alone.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.826
Elena: Ok. I think I may
have missed something.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.666
If you and Liv can both
be the leaders

19:20.668 --> 19:23.403
of your coven, why did
she just get so upset?

19:23.405 --> 19:27.171
Because there aren't
two leaders, are there, Jo?

19:29.677 --> 19:31.475
In our coven's
tradition,

19:31.477 --> 19:33.979
after their 22nd birthday,

19:33.981 --> 19:35.882
the twins merge
their strength.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.379
The stronger one wins,
absorbing their twin's power,

19:38.381 --> 19:42.723
and the weaker
of the two...

19:42.725 --> 19:46.923
The weaker
of the two what?

19:46.925 --> 19:48.827
The weaker one dies.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.466
Caroline's out
looking for you.

20:06.468 --> 20:10.938
She wanted
to apologize.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.274
Why didn't you
tell me?

20:12.276 --> 20:13.674
What?

20:13.676 --> 20:16.074
That my coven requires
my brother and me

20:16.076 --> 20:18.810
to merge
when we turn 22?

20:18.812 --> 20:22.418
Because that's not
totally screwed up.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.786
You're talking to a guy
with a gene that turns him into a wolf.

20:25.788 --> 20:29.058
Look. If you don't want
to merge, then don't.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.690
Your coven doesn't
control you.

20:30.692 --> 20:32.394
My coven needs
a leader.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.930
You don't understand
that because you're

20:33.932 --> 20:35.594
not one of us.

20:35.596 --> 20:37.865
You're not even supposed
to be in my life.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.065
Let me help you.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.737
You can't help me.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.800
Why do you think
I'm trying to get rid of you?

20:42.802 --> 20:46.809
When I look at you...

20:46.811 --> 20:50.442
I feel everything
I don't get to have.

20:50.444 --> 20:52.114
I either die
in the merge,

20:52.116 --> 20:53.818
or I get to live
with the fact that

20:53.820 --> 20:56.682
I killed my own brother.

20:56.684 --> 21:01.722
So tell me, Tyler, how
can you help with that?

21:10.338 --> 21:13.400
So when you say merge,
you don't actually

21:13.402 --> 21:15.408
mean merge, do you?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.408
That's exactly
what I mean.

21:19.410 --> 21:22.576
If Kai gets out,
he'll head straight for Jo.

21:22.578 --> 21:24.816
His ability to siphon
magic will overwhelm Jo,

21:24.818 --> 21:27.448
and she will die,
and our coven will be left

21:27.450 --> 21:30.719
to the whims
of a madman.

21:30.721 --> 21:33.654
Which is now moot thanks
to blond and blonder,

21:33.656 --> 21:34.957
thank goodness.

21:34.959 --> 21:36.757
Look. Let's talk
about this ascendant.

21:36.759 --> 21:38.461
I won't let
him out, Damon.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.925
All right. I wasn't
gonna say anything

21:39.927 --> 21:41.365
because you're
his dad and all,

21:41.367 --> 21:44.565
but if he gets out,
I'll just kill him.

21:44.567 --> 21:45.837
It's that simple.

21:45.839 --> 21:47.764
I've watched Jo
her whole life.

21:47.766 --> 21:52.108
She's done well
on her own, survived war,

21:52.110 --> 21:56.043
become a doctor,
but if Jo merges with Kai,

21:56.045 --> 21:58.643
she will cease to exist.

21:58.645 --> 22:01.043
Kai won't just be
our coven's problem.

22:01.045 --> 22:02.747
He'll be everyone's
problem.

22:07.156 --> 22:09.090
I think I met
your dad.

22:09.092 --> 22:11.826
Well, that's improbable
considering he lives in Portland.

22:11.828 --> 22:15.626
Believe it or not, I'm
actually in Portland.

22:15.628 --> 22:19.034
Ric, you need to tell
me what's going on right now.

22:19.036 --> 22:21.866
Elena: Damon's gone,
as in into thin air?

22:21.868 --> 22:23.434
Oop. Careful.
You just sounded

22:23.436 --> 22:25.201
genuinely concerned
for my brother.

22:25.203 --> 22:27.336
I don't have feelings
for him anymore.

22:27.338 --> 22:28.640
That doesn't mean
I want him to blink

22:28.642 --> 22:30.240
out of existence.

22:30.242 --> 22:32.312
He didn't. It's some
sort of cloaking spell.

22:32.314 --> 22:34.945
Alaric's on the phone with Jo
trying to figure out how to break it.

22:34.947 --> 22:36.785
And to think we could
have all been sitting

22:36.787 --> 22:38.785
around stuffed,
playing board games.

22:38.787 --> 22:41.320
So just to be clear,
Jo was invited

22:41.322 --> 22:43.456
to friendsgiving,
but I wasn't.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.391
Friend code states that
in matters such as yours

22:45.393 --> 22:48.790
and Caroline's I must,
with no exception, take

22:48.792 --> 22:50.622
the side
of my best friend.

22:50.624 --> 22:54.367
And you should just
kiss and make up. It's getting weird.

22:54.369 --> 22:56.602
You're just mad because
no one knew how to carve the turkey.

22:56.604 --> 22:57.740
Heh.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.618
How did you know that
you could trust me?

23:05.620 --> 23:07.260
Trust you with what?

23:07.262 --> 23:09.726
When you were
honest with me

23:09.728 --> 23:12.895
about what you were.

23:12.897 --> 23:14.463
How did you know that
you could trust me

23:14.465 --> 23:17.935
with such a huge secret?

23:17.937 --> 23:20.206
It's easy.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.869
I was in love with you.

23:26.646 --> 23:28.244
You owe me dinner.

23:45.093 --> 23:47.131
Ric, listen to me.

23:47.133 --> 23:49.994
If my dad knows
that you want to open Kai's world,

23:49.996 --> 23:51.897
he'll think you're
going to free him.

23:51.899 --> 23:54.537
He's going to retaliate.

23:54.539 --> 24:01.377
Phesmatos
incendere ad pulvox.

24:01.379 --> 24:02.977
What the hell
are you doing?

24:02.979 --> 24:04.241
And I hate to break
it to you, Ric,

24:04.243 --> 24:06.914
but you traveled
3,000 miles for nothing.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.082
The Ascendant's with me.

24:08.084 --> 24:09.514
You got to be
kidding me, right?

24:09.516 --> 24:10.650
[High-pitched frequency]

24:10.652 --> 24:12.450
Jo? You ok?

24:12.452 --> 24:13.418
Something's wrong.

24:13.420 --> 24:16.562
Jo?

24:16.564 --> 24:17.826
Jo, what's wrong?

24:17.828 --> 24:20.258
I think my dad...

24:20.260 --> 24:21.762
[Gasping]

24:21.764 --> 24:23.699
Jo, what the hell
is going on?

24:23.701 --> 24:26.036
Unh!

24:26.038 --> 24:28.606
My dad's trying
to kill me.

24:28.608 --> 24:30.510
Aah! Ohh!

24:32.381 --> 24:33.579
What the hell is
she talking about?

24:33.580 --> 24:34.746
Her dad's trying
to kill her?

24:34.748 --> 24:36.028
Alaric: Jo, Jo,
answer the phone.

24:37.135 --> 24:39.574
Unh!

24:39.576 --> 24:40.974
Ric?

24:40.976 --> 24:42.141
Elena, what
the hell's going on?

24:42.143 --> 24:43.341
Something's
happening to Jo.

24:43.343 --> 24:44.781
You have to find her
dad and stop him

24:44.783 --> 24:46.277
from whatever he's
doing to her.

24:46.279 --> 24:47.948
Well, that's gonna be
problem because even if

24:47.950 --> 24:49.380
we could see the house
I haven't been invited in.

24:49.382 --> 24:50.452
Invite him.

24:50.454 --> 24:51.788
You can come in!

24:51.790 --> 24:52.819
But we can't see
the damn house.

24:52.821 --> 24:53.915
They need magic!

24:53.917 --> 24:56.955
[Gagging, coughing]

24:56.957 --> 24:58.019
Crap.

24:58.021 --> 24:59.123
Elena, we have
to do something.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.491
Definite signs
of hemoptysis.

25:00.493 --> 25:01.890
Shut up, Liam.

25:01.892 --> 25:03.258
Ask them if they see
an old tree stump

25:03.260 --> 25:05.130
in the front yard?

25:05.132 --> 25:06.130
Yeah, I see it.

25:06.132 --> 25:07.634
Go there now!

25:12.507 --> 25:14.001
[Music playing]

25:14.003 --> 25:16.369
Mmm. Mmm.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.641
Really?

25:21.643 --> 25:24.114
You've been eating
that same piece

25:24.116 --> 25:25.786
for 45 minutes.

25:25.788 --> 25:28.050
Is it a crime to want
to savor our last meal together?

25:28.052 --> 25:29.722
I had Thanksgiving
dinner with you.

25:29.724 --> 25:31.826
Now you keep up your end
of the deal and give me

25:31.828 --> 25:35.058
your car keys.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.530
I should probably
teach you how the clutch works.

25:36.532 --> 25:37.666
It's finicky.

25:37.668 --> 25:38.898
Quit stalling
and give me your keys.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.434
Fine. I'm stalling.

25:41.436 --> 25:46.433
Mmm. But don't you want
to hear how my story ends?

25:46.435 --> 25:47.905
I've read the newspaper.

25:47.907 --> 25:50.576
You murdered
your siblings,

25:50.578 --> 25:52.576
and your coven sent you to live
in this prison world.

25:52.578 --> 25:57.652
My family sent me
to this prison world.

25:57.654 --> 26:01.290
My father,

26:01.292 --> 26:05.058
the great coven leader
who treated me like crap

26:05.060 --> 26:09.658
for 22 years
and then locked me here.

26:09.660 --> 26:15.735
It's like his--like his
kids didn't even matter.

26:15.737 --> 26:18.101
Coven always came
first no matter what.

26:23.737 --> 26:26.334
If Kai has access
to an ascendant

26:26.336 --> 26:28.670
and is sharing his prison
with the Bennett witch,

26:28.672 --> 26:32.073
he will eventually find
his way out.

26:32.075 --> 26:34.444
At least, this will
keep him from merging.

26:34.446 --> 26:36.455
You're just
gonna take out Jo?

26:36.457 --> 26:39.763
The coven comes
before family.

26:45.306 --> 26:48.274
Unh! Ugh!

26:55.486 --> 26:57.554
What the hell are we
gonna do with a knife?

26:57.556 --> 26:59.353
Maybe it's Jo's
version of Ms. Cuddles.

27:01.524 --> 27:03.258
[Thwap]

27:03.260 --> 27:04.890
Nice shot.

27:17.339 --> 27:18.673
Invisique.

27:24.612 --> 27:27.850
Well, I guess the, uh,
disappearing act's

27:27.852 --> 27:29.018
their shtick.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.882
Yeah.

27:30.884 --> 27:33.585
Hey. Anybody
hear from Jo?

27:36.227 --> 27:37.689
You need to tell
me what's going on.

27:37.691 --> 27:38.890
You have to
get more ice.

27:38.892 --> 27:40.394
I'm not an idiot,
Elena.

27:40.396 --> 27:42.394
I know you're lying
to me, so whatever it is,

27:42.396 --> 27:45.770
just tell me, please.

27:45.772 --> 27:47.202
She's crashing!

27:49.436 --> 27:50.674
Dr. Laughlin,
look at me.

27:50.676 --> 27:52.170
Jo, can you
hear me? Jo!

27:52.172 --> 27:53.738
Come on, Dr. Laughlin.
Please wake up.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.210
Check for dilation.

27:58.579 --> 27:59.745
Holy crap.

27:59.747 --> 28:01.785
What the--what
happened to her?

28:01.787 --> 28:03.113
I don't know.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.016
Call 911.
I'll start CPR.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.857
Call 911, Elena.
We need help.

28:08.859 --> 28:10.760
She's about to die.

28:10.762 --> 28:13.256
Liam...

28:13.258 --> 28:17.464
Liam, there's
not enough time.

28:17.466 --> 28:19.367
What are you doing?

28:25.072 --> 28:26.670
Elena, your face.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.438
It's ok. My blood
will heal her.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.582
[Gasps]

28:33.584 --> 28:35.846
Jo?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.278
I'm ok.

28:43.857 --> 28:45.591
I'll get you
some water.

28:49.033 --> 28:50.799
Elena. Elena, stop!

28:54.705 --> 28:57.806
How did you do that?

28:57.808 --> 28:59.039
How did you
do that?!

28:59.041 --> 29:02.745
I'm a vampire.

29:02.747 --> 29:06.114
You're what?

29:06.116 --> 29:09.754
It doesn't matter
because as much as

29:09.756 --> 29:14.690
I like you my life is
complicated enough.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.760
So you're not gonna
remember anything

29:20.762 --> 29:22.800
from tonight or
about Lady Whitmore

29:22.802 --> 29:25.032
or the fact that we
even dated at all.

29:25.034 --> 29:29.199
You're gonna go home,
get some rest,

29:29.201 --> 29:31.535
and I'll see you
at work on Monday.

29:35.513 --> 29:37.311
I'll see you
Monday, Elena.

29:49.693 --> 29:51.827
Kai: Olivia, Lukas?

29:55.067 --> 29:56.729
Olivia?

29:59.667 --> 30:02.537
Lukas?

30:02.539 --> 30:06.105
Come out. Come out
wherever you are.

30:06.107 --> 30:09.577
Stop!

30:09.579 --> 30:11.217
I'll do it.

30:11.219 --> 30:15.050
I'll merge
with you.

30:15.052 --> 30:17.185
Just don't hurt
anyone else.

30:17.187 --> 30:19.553
Bonnie: So Jo
agreed to the merge?

30:19.555 --> 30:21.152
Well, we need
a celestial event,

30:21.154 --> 30:22.960
so the plan was to use
the power of the eclipse

30:22.962 --> 30:25.424
happening the next day.

30:25.426 --> 30:29.158
She even gathered
our coven to help.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.057
Young Jo: The power
of the eclipse will merge us as one.

30:33.059 --> 30:35.756
You know what to say?

30:35.758 --> 30:37.564
Been practicing
my whole life.

30:42.729 --> 30:45.365
Both: Sanguinem desimilus...

30:45.367 --> 30:48.964
Sanguinem
generis fiantus.

30:55.572 --> 30:59.440
I don't feel
anything.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.575
Sanguinem
desimilus...

31:01.577 --> 31:05.207
Sanguinem
generis fiantus.

31:13.520 --> 31:17.389
Josette, what
did you do?

31:17.391 --> 31:19.189
Why can't
I feel your magic?

31:26.295 --> 31:28.301
And why aren't they
saying anything?

31:30.639 --> 31:32.302
They should be
saying something.

31:32.304 --> 31:35.469
They should be saying
something, right?

31:35.471 --> 31:38.973
We're merging.
This should all be a bigger deal.

31:38.975 --> 31:41.413
Joshua:
Sanguinem filio,

31:41.415 --> 31:43.949
sanguinem effurgarex
perpetuum.

31:43.951 --> 31:45.613
Sanguinem filio,

31:45.615 --> 31:48.255
sanguinem effurgarex
perpetuum.

31:48.257 --> 31:49.591
Aah! Aah!

31:49.593 --> 31:52.625
Phesmatos filio,

31:52.627 --> 32:00.665
phesmatos effurgarex
perpetuum.

32:00.667 --> 32:04.641
Kai, voice-over:
They tricked me good.

32:04.643 --> 32:06.473
Instead of using
the power of the eclipse

32:06.475 --> 32:09.608
for the merge, my dad
used it to send me here,

32:09.610 --> 32:11.240
and where'd Jo's
magic go?

32:11.242 --> 32:13.680
You know, it
made zero sense.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.112
Magic doesn't just,
like, disappear,

32:16.114 --> 32:18.184
but then you made yours
disappear when you hid

32:18.186 --> 32:21.184
it in Ms. Cuddles,
and it hit me.

32:21.186 --> 32:23.856
My sneaky little
twin sister

32:23.858 --> 32:25.592
hid her magic...

32:28.026 --> 32:29.664
in this.

32:32.970 --> 32:35.400
Hmm.

32:35.402 --> 32:38.504
Still there.

32:38.506 --> 32:40.704
Still here

32:40.706 --> 32:44.774
and still full
of magic.

32:58.694 --> 33:02.625
Well, it was.

33:02.627 --> 33:04.392
I just
sucked it out.

33:06.257 --> 33:09.527
You have magic again.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.696
Good for you.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.536
I also have
the Ascendant.

33:13.538 --> 33:15.672
Doesn't matter. You need
a Bennett witch to do the spell.

33:15.674 --> 33:16.736
About that.
I've watched you

33:16.738 --> 33:19.704
do the spell
twice now.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.872
I don't think I need a Bennett witch
to do the spell.

33:22.874 --> 33:25.112
I think all I
actually need

33:25.114 --> 33:26.713
is Bennett blood.

33:28.347 --> 33:29.513
Unh!

33:31.189 --> 33:32.620
Ugh!

33:39.026 --> 33:40.786
All right.
So let's just get this straight.

33:40.881 --> 33:42.588
We went to the airport,
we took off all our

33:42.589 --> 33:44.603
clothes for security
just so I can come out

33:44.604 --> 33:46.873
here, have my brain
scrambled by papa Kai,

33:46.874 --> 33:49.504
who by the way can
disappear into thin air--

33:49.506 --> 33:53.040
poof--only to find
Jo's rusty knife full of magic.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.448
And we learned that
the Ascendant,

33:54.450 --> 33:56.312
i.e., the only reason
we flew our asses out here

33:56.314 --> 33:58.112
in the first place,
is actually with Jo

33:58.114 --> 34:00.384
at Whitmore 5 minutes
from where we started.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.656
Great.

34:01.658 --> 34:02.824
Jo said she kept it
with her to ensure

34:02.826 --> 34:04.456
that Kai would never
be released.

34:04.458 --> 34:05.888
Genius. Great.
Then we go home.

34:05.890 --> 34:07.056
Shotgun. Come on.

34:07.058 --> 34:08.822
Guys, hey. We can't
do this, ok?

34:08.824 --> 34:10.190
We need to find
another way and one that doesn't

34:10.193 --> 34:11.862
end up with
my girlfriend dead.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.231
Girlfriend?

34:13.233 --> 34:14.263
You've been on,
like, 3 dates.

34:14.264 --> 34:15.703
Nice, Damon.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.031
What? I'm just saying
he barely knows her,

34:17.033 --> 34:18.271
and her literal evil
twin is over there

34:18.273 --> 34:19.871
with Bonnie right now.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.574
Guys, I will do what
I can to help,

34:21.577 --> 34:23.143
but we're not letting her
brother out, all right?

34:23.145 --> 34:24.712
The Ascendant is
off the table.

34:30.315 --> 34:33.417
Ok. Get the Ascendant
from Jo.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.121
Do whatever you got
to do to get it,

34:35.123 --> 34:36.426
you understand?

34:36.428 --> 34:37.962
I understand.

34:37.964 --> 34:39.163
What are you doing?

34:39.165 --> 34:40.699
What? You got
a better idea?

34:53.878 --> 34:55.411
[Yawns]

34:56.614 --> 34:58.212
Good morning.

35:04.390 --> 35:06.252
Where am I?

35:06.254 --> 35:10.626
You passed out, so
I brought you home.

35:10.628 --> 35:15.794
You kidnapped me?
Romantic.

35:15.796 --> 35:18.770
I am protecting
you, Liv.

35:18.772 --> 35:20.369
I'm not letting you
sacrifice yourself

35:20.371 --> 35:23.873
because your coven
needs a leader.

35:23.875 --> 35:25.104
They'll come after me.

35:25.106 --> 35:26.808
Let them.

35:26.810 --> 35:29.208
Magic doesn't work
in Mystic Falls,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.312
so if your coven wants to find you,
they'll have to do it

35:31.314 --> 35:33.175
the old-fashioned way.

35:33.177 --> 35:35.046
They'll have to
go through me.

35:46.956 --> 35:49.586
I'm sorry I ruined
Thanksgiving.

35:52.291 --> 35:55.393
You'll make up
for it next year.

35:55.395 --> 35:59.130
We'll find another
way, Liv.

35:59.132 --> 36:00.770
I'm not going
to let you die.

36:27.829 --> 36:29.025
Hey.

36:29.027 --> 36:31.398
Hey.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.765
You're here.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.269
That's good.

36:36.271 --> 36:39.636
That actually
saves me a trip.

36:39.638 --> 36:43.340
Needless to say,
there were leftovers.

36:43.342 --> 36:45.205
You made me
a doggie bag.

36:45.207 --> 36:47.374
Heh. Just because I hate
you doesn't mean I want

36:47.376 --> 36:49.678
you to starve to death.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.318
Besides, Bonnie's alive.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.150
You know, this is, like,
the first Thanksgiving

36:53.152 --> 36:55.518
in forever where there's
something to actually be

36:55.520 --> 36:58.054
thankful for, so...

37:00.424 --> 37:04.198
Caroline, um, look.

37:04.200 --> 37:09.230
When Damon was gone,
I, um--

37:09.232 --> 37:11.438
I pushed you away.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.837
Yeah, I know, Stefan.

37:13.839 --> 37:15.269
You pushed
everyone away.

37:15.271 --> 37:16.405
It's kind of
what you do.

37:16.407 --> 37:19.141
But I pushed you
away the most.

37:19.143 --> 37:22.813
I knew that you were
the one person who would

37:22.815 --> 37:25.917
sit with me
and let me cry,

37:25.919 --> 37:28.853
and I didn't want
to cry anymore,

37:28.855 --> 37:35.062
so I had to push you
away the most.

37:38.999 --> 37:41.698
Thank you
for saying that.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.275
Listen.

37:50.277 --> 37:54.275
Enjoy the leftovers.

37:54.277 --> 37:56.410
[Music playing]

38:10.427 --> 38:11.889
You should have
brought me with you.

38:11.891 --> 38:13.424
Well, first, you should
have told me that Bonnie

38:13.426 --> 38:15.264
was alive,
and then you should have

38:15.266 --> 38:16.464
brought me with you.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.096
Well, Ric had more
frequent flyer miles,

38:18.098 --> 38:19.496
and Ric didn't
deliberately forget

38:19.498 --> 38:23.799
our entire relationship.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.103
Yeah. I deserve that.

38:26.105 --> 38:27.407
Mm-hmm.

38:29.241 --> 38:30.575
So you and Bonnie
spent the last

38:30.577 --> 38:31.910
4 months together?

38:31.912 --> 38:34.246
Yeah.

38:34.248 --> 38:35.614
What did you do?

38:35.616 --> 38:37.950
Bicker mostly.

38:37.952 --> 38:40.414
Cooked, ate.

38:40.416 --> 38:42.118
We went through
a Tetris phase, but I beat it,

38:42.120 --> 38:43.758
and she got mad.

38:46.296 --> 38:48.990
We talked.

38:48.992 --> 38:50.326
A lot.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.798
Apparently there are
a lot of words

38:51.800 --> 38:53.334
in the English language,
and Bonnie knows just

38:53.336 --> 38:55.397
about all of them.

38:55.399 --> 39:00.605
Yep. I know this
is gonna sound pretty strange,

39:00.607 --> 39:03.605
but I'm really
happy that

39:03.607 --> 39:06.909
the two of you
had each other.

39:06.911 --> 39:11.613
She sacrificed herself
so I could come back.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.885
Hmm.

39:13.887 --> 39:17.190
Wow.

39:17.192 --> 39:19.791
Because when she
wasn't talking, she was listening.

39:19.793 --> 39:21.791
She listened for hours
and hours and hours,

39:21.793 --> 39:24.966
so when the opportunity
presented itself for me

39:24.968 --> 39:31.838
to come back,
she made sure I took it.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.005
What did you talk about?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.805
What do you think?

39:41.815 --> 39:43.517
I broke up with Liam.

39:49.857 --> 39:54.494
Dr. Future Humanitarian
award wasn't good enough?

39:54.496 --> 39:57.829
What went wrong?

39:57.831 --> 39:59.500
What do you think?

40:03.766 --> 40:06.500
Look. I'm at
a crossroads right now,

40:06.502 --> 40:09.372
where I could go live my
life the way I think

40:09.374 --> 40:12.739
I probably should
and be successful

40:12.741 --> 40:17.778
and safe
and probably very happy,

40:17.780 --> 40:19.178
or I could risk all that

40:19.180 --> 40:22.050
for this tiny glimmer
of a feeling inside

40:22.052 --> 40:26.018
that I just can't shake.

40:29.764 --> 40:37.403
Well, Robert Frost,
what's it gonna be?

40:37.405 --> 40:39.339
I don't know...

40:41.405 --> 40:45.538
But I do know someone who could
give me some pretty sound advice.

40:49.044 --> 40:51.451
Any chance you'd be
willing to help me bring

40:51.453 --> 40:53.347
my best friend
Bonnie back?

40:59.125 --> 41:01.291
Sure.

41:03.325 --> 41:05.427
[Sighs]

41:05.429 --> 41:08.195
[Pager vibrating]

41:19.981 --> 41:21.412
What?

41:25.350 --> 41:26.884
"I lied"?

41:40.029 --> 41:41.634
There's no car.

41:41.636 --> 41:44.298
The bastard
took the car.
