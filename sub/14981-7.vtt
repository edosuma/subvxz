00:12.900 --> 00:15.367
It's black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving kick-off

00:15.434 --> 00:17.200
into the holiday shopping season.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.800
And retailers are advertising even
deeper discounts this year,

00:21.004 --> 00:24.039
trying to lure cash-strapped consumers.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.441
All managers to their departments.

00:26.509 --> 00:28.076
All managers to their departments.

00:28.144 --> 00:30.846
All right, who wants to save some money?

00:36.286 --> 00:40.255
Doors opening in 5 minutes.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.190
Where is it?

00:42.258 --> 00:43.258
Maybe your wallet's in the car?

00:43.326 --> 00:45.827
I swear, it was in my jacket.

00:45.895 --> 00:49.598
Save our place.

00:49.666 --> 00:51.566
Excuse me.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.935
Pardon me.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.645
All right, when I say "digital,"
you say "corner."

01:03.713 --> 01:04.680
Digital!

01:04.747 --> 01:05.681
Corner!

01:05.748 --> 01:07.349
Digital!
Corner!

01:11.754 --> 01:16.058
For an extra 100, how can
we not go with the 50 inch?

01:17.727 --> 01:19.761
How about an "excuse me," bitch?

01:23.900 --> 01:25.634
Aah!

01:38.014 --> 01:41.049
Open the doors! Open the doors, dammit!

02:12.097 --> 02:15.066
Did calculus get harder since we took it?

02:15.134 --> 02:16.534
That's what I said.

02:16.602 --> 02:19.304
That's all right, I'll just figure it out myself.

02:19.371 --> 02:22.707
I mean, you'd think with the intellectual
stock I come from, though.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.143
Apples always fall further
from the tree than you think.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.778
There's something to be grateful for, right?

02:26.845 --> 02:28.012
How was Thanksgiving?

02:28.080 --> 02:30.181
Oh, you know, dad lectured...

02:30.249 --> 02:31.115
I did not lecture.

02:31.183 --> 02:32.917
Mom fretted.
I didn't lecture.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.218
So much to be thankful for.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.489
I mean, don't you think I'm getting a little old

02:38.557 --> 02:39.958
for make-believe family holidays?

02:40.025 --> 02:41.960
Well, that's how your mom likes it, love.

02:42.027 --> 02:44.729
Heh. You're a little odd.

02:44.797 --> 02:45.797
Why?

02:45.864 --> 02:47.298
The apron.

02:47.366 --> 02:49.567
I think it's becoming.

02:49.635 --> 02:52.503
Hey, uh, dad, Gill,

02:52.571 --> 02:53.838
this is Max Roland.

02:53.906 --> 02:57.408
Apparently he's 16 and a big fan of your book.

02:57.476 --> 02:59.177
Over here. Now!

02:59.244 --> 03:00.712
He's a complete stranger.

03:00.779 --> 03:03.848
My address isn't listed.
How'd you find me?

03:03.916 --> 03:05.116
Online.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.951
I just need half an hour
of your time, Dr. Lightman.

03:07.019 --> 03:08.886
You got 2 minutes.

03:08.954 --> 03:11.289
My parents have lied to me
my whole life about who I am.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.390
I'm not their kid.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.726
Who are you, then?

03:14.793 --> 03:16.661
This kid. James Knox.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.030
The James Knox?

03:19.098 --> 03:20.198
Well, how do you know you're him?

03:20.265 --> 03:22.634
Look at the scar.

03:22.701 --> 03:24.202
James Knox has one just like it.

03:24.269 --> 03:26.037
We've all got scars. You want to see mine?

03:26.105 --> 03:27.705
Look.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.607
I took a DNA sample from my parents.

03:29.675 --> 03:30.942
All right, I'm not a match.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.944
Their story of how I was born,

03:33.012 --> 03:34.012
it doesn't make sense.

03:34.079 --> 03:36.214
I can't spend another Christmas

03:36.281 --> 03:37.949
with people who might have stolen me.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.084
Please.

03:40.152 --> 03:41.452
I have $500.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.488
This is all I have to pay you.

03:43.555 --> 03:45.156
Will you talk to my parents?

03:46.025 --> 03:47.959
I have to know the truth.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.201
Want a sandwich?

03:58.804 --> 04:00.171
If he really is James Knox,

04:00.239 --> 04:02.173
he's in a very difficult spot, psychologically.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.941
We need to handle this carefully.

04:04.009 --> 04:06.644
Well, don't we always?

04:06.712 --> 04:08.279
I can't believe you took his money.

04:08.347 --> 04:10.848
Well, he wanted me to take him seriously.

04:10.916 --> 04:12.850
I am.

04:14.053 --> 04:16.220
Who holds interviews
on a holiday weekend?

04:16.288 --> 04:18.255
Be patient. Max really wants this.

04:18.322 --> 04:19.524
Hey.
Hey.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.125
Ready to interview my parents?
They're getting antsy.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.394
I'm not gonna interview
your parents, you are.

04:23.462 --> 04:25.229
I thought you said you were gonna help me.

04:25.297 --> 04:27.131
No, look. If you want to know the truth,

04:27.199 --> 04:28.366
you ask the questions, all right?

04:28.434 --> 04:29.500
So no "yes or no" phrasing.

04:29.568 --> 04:30.768
And look at me. Look at me.

04:30.836 --> 04:31.936
Don't back down.

04:32.004 --> 04:33.438
Max, you don't have to do this.

04:33.505 --> 04:35.039
It said in your book,

04:35.107 --> 04:36.474
the best interrogations are
when you can watch,

04:36.542 --> 04:37.542
you don't have to ask the questions.

04:37.609 --> 04:39.477
I want the best.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.446
All right, well, that's what you paid for.

04:45.184 --> 04:48.086
Hey, uh, it'll just be a few more minutes.

04:48.153 --> 04:51.122
They're in with some of the other nominees.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.493
You look nervous.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.462
What's wrong?

04:57.529 --> 05:00.598
Look, I know I'm not your son.
Who am I?

05:00.666 --> 05:01.666
Oh! This again?

05:01.734 --> 05:03.735
Max, not here.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.770
There's no pictures of me as a newborn.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.071
It doesn't make any sense.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.040
You were born in Ecuador.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.142
Mom had you premature.
We've told you all this.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.844
You went to Ecuador pregnant?

05:12.911 --> 05:14.345
I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like something

05:14.413 --> 05:15.546
a smart mom would do.

05:15.614 --> 05:16.814
I think I know better than you

05:16.882 --> 05:18.850
what a mother would and wouldn't do.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.184
He said "mom," she said "mother."

05:20.252 --> 05:22.353
Distancing language. Yeah.

05:22.421 --> 05:24.489
I ordered a DNA test online.

05:24.556 --> 05:25.656
I took hairs from your brushes.

05:25.724 --> 05:27.725
I just got the results back.

05:27.793 --> 05:29.727
I'm not related to either of you.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.698
Nice fear on both of them.

05:33.766 --> 05:37.568
Max, what the hell is going on?

05:40.439 --> 05:41.372
What is this?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.307
Mr. and Mrs. Roland, I'm Gillian Foster.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.209
I'm a psychologist with the Lightman Group.

05:45.277 --> 05:46.310
What is this place?

05:46.378 --> 05:48.146
Max came to us. He needs our help.

05:48.213 --> 05:49.280
Max, we're leaving.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.215
Mr. Lightman, they're lying, right?

05:51.283 --> 05:52.917
They're lying.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.352
Max, now.

05:54.419 --> 05:55.953
Go.

06:00.559 --> 06:02.727
You may have just sent him
home with his abductors.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.529
Where's Reynolds?

06:04.596 --> 06:05.830
Still in South Carolina.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.031
Well, that's one problem solved.

06:07.099 --> 06:09.000
The other one's the cops. We can't call them.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.768
If the cops or press or FBI

06:10.836 --> 06:12.670
get wind that someone who
may be James Knox surfaced,

06:12.738 --> 06:15.807
I mean, the vultures will pick Max to pieces.

06:15.874 --> 06:16.841
we have to protect him.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.276
And we have to talk to the Knoxes.

06:19.111 --> 06:20.244
What?

06:20.312 --> 06:21.512
Finally got you thinking like a criminal.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.080
Wonders will never cease.

06:23.148 --> 06:24.282
If this thing goes south,

06:24.349 --> 06:27.652
you're putting up my bail.

06:27.719 --> 06:29.353
Michigan 2005.

06:29.421 --> 06:31.789
Shoppers burst through the
doors of a major retail chain

06:31.857 --> 06:33.291
'causing multiple injuries.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.493
India 2008.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.862
Rumors of a landslide at a
Hindu temple cause panic.

06:37.930 --> 06:41.032
About 140 people lose
their lives trying to escape.

06:41.099 --> 06:42.533
Los Angeles.

06:42.601 --> 06:45.269
Lakers fans celebrate a championship
by looting and rioting.

06:45.337 --> 06:48.372
About a million dollars worth of
property damage to local businesses.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.410
In every example, the violence was
instigated by someone in the crowd.

06:52.477 --> 06:54.078
What are you proposing, Mr. Loker?

06:54.146 --> 06:55.713
2 of your customers died.

06:55.781 --> 06:57.215
Dozens were injured.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.316
People are looking for a scapegoat,

06:58.383 --> 07:00.985
and Digital Corner's an easy target.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.621
What if I could prove your company wasn't at fault?

07:03.689 --> 07:05.990
Cases like this turn on comparative negligence.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.492
If the stampede was crowd induced,

07:08.560 --> 07:11.128
It would reduce the settlement considerably.

07:11.196 --> 07:14.065
This is the raw feed from Channel 3.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.835
Notice the dad showing his
boys how to lock arms

07:17.903 --> 07:19.637
and form a phalanx.

07:19.705 --> 07:24.408
They... what, they expected violence?

07:24.476 --> 07:26.410
Well, convergence theory says
that if crowds act aggressively,

07:26.478 --> 07:29.480
it's because people bring
an aggressive mindset to it.

07:29.548 --> 07:31.215
And in the close-ups,
you can see their faces.

07:31.283 --> 07:35.853
They're identical to those of
athletes during competition.

07:35.921 --> 07:38.990
This crowd was a powder keg
and somebody in it was the spark.

07:39.057 --> 07:41.826
Maybe so, but we can't have our
name dragged through the press

07:41.894 --> 07:43.895
During our busy shopping season.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.496
We're planning on settling
first thing Monday morning.

07:45.564 --> 07:46.530
How much are you expecting to pay out?

07:46.598 --> 07:48.432
20 million, give or take.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.868
Give me a few days to prove
my thesis before you settle.

07:50.936 --> 07:53.871
If I can trace the stampede
to somebody in the crowd,

07:53.939 --> 07:55.973
the Lightman Group gets 10% of what you save.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.010
You save us 10 million, you earn one.

07:59.077 --> 07:59.944
And if you pay the full 20,

08:00.012 --> 08:01.345
we don't see a dime.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.651
Hey, how'd it go with the suits?

08:06.718 --> 08:08.653
Well, we got the job. Where were you?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.187
None of your bloody business.

08:10.255 --> 08:11.856
I figured you were up to it, so.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.091
It's probably a gross overestimation on my part.

08:14.159 --> 08:16.193
I appreciate the confidence boost.

08:16.261 --> 08:18.529
Well, selling's the easy part.

08:18.597 --> 08:19.931
It's delivering, that's the trick.

08:19.998 --> 08:21.198
And that's what you promised.

08:21.266 --> 08:22.767
So you and Torres are on your own.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.268
Think you're up for it?

08:24.336 --> 08:26.604
I've read every major study on
group behavior cover to cover.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.205
This is my wheelhouse.

08:28.273 --> 08:30.508
Fascinating.

08:30.575 --> 08:33.410
Well, time will tell.

08:33.477 --> 08:35.279
Any more words or inspiration?

08:35.347 --> 08:39.417
Yeah. We need the money.
And don't embarrass me.

08:41.285 --> 08:44.188
You think you found James?
After all these years?

08:44.256 --> 08:45.323
Mr. and mrs. Knox,

08:45.390 --> 08:47.725
we don't want you to get your hopes up,

08:47.793 --> 08:49.126
But we would like to do a DNA test

08:49.194 --> 08:52.830
just to confirm things one way or another.

08:52.898 --> 08:55.066
The scar's from the same type
of operation, though, right?

08:55.934 --> 08:57.401
Do you have a picture?

08:57.469 --> 08:59.303
Cal.

08:59.371 --> 09:02.907
Oh, sorry.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.009
It was taken this morning.

09:06.244 --> 09:09.313
He's got your chin.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.384
This must be overwhelming.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.820
No, it's just I'm... I'm shocked

09:15.887 --> 09:17.755
that we might be able to find James.

09:19.224 --> 09:20.658
I got a question for you.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.193
Do you... either of you,

09:22.260 --> 09:23.995
do you remember, was it overcast

09:24.062 --> 09:27.164
the day that your son was abducted?

09:27.232 --> 09:28.532
Do you remember?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.001
It's 16 years ago.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.435
I think it was overcast.

09:31.503 --> 09:32.436
It definitely was.

09:32.504 --> 09:34.105
It was?

09:35.674 --> 09:38.309
I think you're lying, Mrs. Knox.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.745
When people are telling the truth,

09:40.812 --> 09:45.249
they don't feel the need to recall small details

09:45.317 --> 09:46.517
many years later.

09:46.585 --> 09:47.952
You're ashamed of something.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.987
What are you ashamed of?

09:50.055 --> 09:51.322
What are you talking about?

09:51.390 --> 09:52.490
What is it? What is it?

09:52.557 --> 09:53.657
Is your son still alive?

09:53.725 --> 09:55.359
What happened to James, Mrs. Knox?

09:55.427 --> 09:56.694
Or did you murder him?
Did you murder him?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.529
Of course not.
Did you murder him?

09:58.597 --> 10:00.197
Did you kill him?

10:00.265 --> 10:02.266
What the hell is wrong with you people?
She didn't kill him.

10:02.334 --> 10:03.601
Did you kill him?
No.

10:03.668 --> 10:04.969
Did you kill your son?

10:05.037 --> 10:06.203
Did you torture him before you killed him?

10:06.271 --> 10:08.539
Did you make him suffer?
No, it was an accident!

10:08.607 --> 10:10.574
What?

10:19.084 --> 10:23.421
I...

10:23.488 --> 10:29.560
Went into the kitchen while the bath was running.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.897
I don't know how...

10:32.964 --> 10:35.166
He had drowned.

10:38.470 --> 10:42.039
I was going right back.

10:44.576 --> 10:49.113
Robbie, Robbie, I didn't mean to.

10:49.181 --> 10:53.084
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

10:55.854 --> 10:58.789
I didn't want you to hate me.

11:00.559 --> 11:01.792
Maybe they're lying.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.261
They're telling the truth
to the police right now.

11:04.329 --> 11:07.598
If I'm not James Knox...

11:07.666 --> 11:09.300
Who am I?

11:09.367 --> 11:11.502
You're the same person you were yesterday

11:11.570 --> 11:12.636
and the day before, Max.

11:12.704 --> 11:13.637
Don't call me that, all right.

11:13.705 --> 11:15.473
I'm someone else.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.908
Well, what do you want to be called, then?

11:17.976 --> 11:20.978
Who do you want to be?
You want to be, uh, Johnny?

11:21.046 --> 11:23.414
You want to be a Paul?
Do you want to be a Steve?

11:23.482 --> 11:28.252
You want to be a Sid? You know,
you look like a Steve to me.

11:31.156 --> 11:34.325
All of these are boys around your age

11:34.392 --> 11:36.260
that were abducted when they were babies

11:36.328 --> 11:39.130
or when they were kids.

11:39.197 --> 11:40.631
Which one do you think is you?

11:40.699 --> 11:42.967
I'm never gonna find out who I am.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.502
Right, that's what you're trying to say?

11:44.569 --> 11:46.971
No, you know, you're a crap listener, boysie.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.973
Really, pay attention, right.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.976
What I'm saying is I'm in.

11:52.043 --> 11:53.811
Are you?

11:53.879 --> 11:54.945
Think carefully before you answer that

11:55.013 --> 11:56.514
because if we do go down this rabbit hole,

11:56.581 --> 11:58.582
there's no telling what's gonna bite you.

12:05.857 --> 12:08.192
I'm in.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.577
He's in.

12:13.564 --> 12:14.998
Max, you have to let this go.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.666
He's not gonna.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.335
I mean, why should he?

12:19.402 --> 12:21.337
If he's not your son,

12:21.404 --> 12:23.906
he should know why you've kept it from him.

12:23.973 --> 12:25.240
I mean, either you've got a good reason

12:25.308 --> 12:30.212
or you're monsters who stole
someone else's baby.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.947
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

12:32.015 --> 12:33.615
Want to see if the cops agree with you?

12:33.683 --> 12:38.153
I know you both love Max deeply

12:38.221 --> 12:41.090
and you would never want to hurt him.

12:41.157 --> 12:44.326
But you are. He's in a lot of pain.

12:44.394 --> 12:47.996
You're not protecting him anymore.

12:48.064 --> 12:50.899
You're just hurting him.

12:55.638 --> 12:57.573
Jackie.

13:03.012 --> 13:05.347
Her name was Cheyenne.

13:05.415 --> 13:09.118
She was barely older than you are.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.654
It can cost a fortune to adopt.

13:12.722 --> 13:17.326
And back then, we didn't have
the money to pay for a service.

13:17.394 --> 13:19.161
She didn't want any formal papers.

13:19.229 --> 13:21.330
She just wanted out.

13:21.398 --> 13:22.731
And we wanted a baby.

13:22.799 --> 13:27.770
We gave her some money for
the hospital bills and that was it.

13:27.837 --> 13:32.207
You were her baby, but you're our son.

13:32.275 --> 13:37.279
Maxie, what? We've been good
parents to you, haven't we?

13:38.815 --> 13:40.249
Say what's on your mind, son.

13:40.316 --> 13:42.651
Why didn't you tell me?

13:43.820 --> 13:47.689
We thought if anyone learned the truth...

13:47.757 --> 13:49.057
they'd take him away from you.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.626
Yeah.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.429
Who is she?

13:53.496 --> 13:54.797
My mother.

13:59.436 --> 14:01.069
Is this all of them?

14:01.137 --> 14:02.438
These are the lead plaintiffs.

14:02.505 --> 14:03.872
There's another 80 names on the suit,

14:03.940 --> 14:05.741
but these are the real bloodsuckers.

14:05.809 --> 14:07.409
Or the real victims.

14:09.612 --> 14:11.713
Why are they even talking to us?

14:11.781 --> 14:12.881
Well, Digital Corner sold it to their lawyer

14:12.949 --> 14:14.316
as part of the investigation.

14:14.384 --> 14:18.153
Well, let's be honest, who doesn't
enjoy a good bitch session?

14:21.591 --> 14:23.292
Did you know that the doors
opened 20 minutes late?

14:23.359 --> 14:25.294
They didn't even have my tv in stock.

14:25.361 --> 14:26.328
It was a bait and switch.

14:26.396 --> 14:27.329
I was almost trampled to death.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.465
Listen, we need to get paid.

14:30.834 --> 14:34.636
Ok, it's our job to determine
what started everything.

14:34.704 --> 14:35.938
That's what we've been asking.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.906
The store hasn't turned over any security video.

14:37.974 --> 14:40.075
Let's just begin with what you remember.

14:40.143 --> 14:41.577
One of the rent-a-cops picked a fight.

14:41.644 --> 14:42.778
It was right behind me.

14:42.846 --> 14:45.013
I saw him pushing folks around like cattle.

14:45.081 --> 14:46.748
He was a bully. Damn near knocked me over.

14:46.816 --> 14:48.417
All right, so this guard starts a brawl,

14:48.485 --> 14:50.886
and then everyone pushes for the door?

14:50.954 --> 14:52.354
Can you describe him?

14:54.724 --> 14:56.058
White guy, shaved head.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.794
You all just shifted your gaze to this guy.

14:58.862 --> 14:59.761
You're looking to him for the answer.

14:59.829 --> 15:01.129
You think we're lying?

15:01.197 --> 15:02.598
Well, not consciously.

15:02.665 --> 15:04.399
It's more likely a case of memory conformity.

15:04.467 --> 15:05.634
You've all heard each other's story,

15:05.702 --> 15:06.902
so you think it happened to you.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.904
Right. But you didn't remember
the race of the guard

15:08.972 --> 15:10.005
Because you never saw him.

15:10.073 --> 15:11.940
So you go to the real source.

15:12.008 --> 15:15.811
I'll be supervising these interviews.

15:18.281 --> 15:20.382
Waylon said he was shopping for his family.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.317
Eye shift downward says otherwise.

15:22.385 --> 15:23.719
Educated guess, he was
there for someone else,

15:23.786 --> 15:25.687
like his mistress.

15:25.755 --> 15:28.891
Oh, and he is not your only client

15:28.958 --> 15:30.392
with a truthfulness allergy.

15:30.460 --> 15:33.128
Delisha faked anger when Rita
asked her about her arm.

15:33.196 --> 15:34.696
Her eyebrows never pulled together,

15:34.764 --> 15:35.998
lips never pressed or tightened.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.366
She's faking it.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.635
That doesn't excuse the store
or the security guard.

15:39.702 --> 15:41.703
Oh, the bully? No, that wasn't a lie.

15:41.771 --> 15:43.539
As far as we can tell.

15:44.774 --> 15:46.241
Just because a few people are gaming the system

15:46.309 --> 15:48.510
doesn't mean Digital Corner's off the hook.

16:12.602 --> 16:15.003
What are you doing in the DMV database?

16:16.205 --> 16:19.074
Your dad is committing a felony.

16:19.142 --> 16:21.443
Why am I not surprised?

16:26.049 --> 16:30.819
I'd take you with me, but that would
make you an accessory after the fact.

16:32.455 --> 16:34.790
Feel free.

16:35.792 --> 16:40.696
I, uh, can't believe you found me.

16:40.763 --> 16:42.230
He's been looking for me?

16:42.298 --> 16:44.433
Oh, yeah, for a long time now.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.201
Yeah, he just wants to meet you.

16:47.770 --> 16:48.804
He's here?

16:48.871 --> 16:50.272
Yep.

16:51.975 --> 16:52.975
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.309
You did the right thing by him.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.181
Ok.

16:59.248 --> 17:00.882
I want to meet him.

17:06.055 --> 17:07.489
Maxie boy.

17:07.557 --> 17:08.757
Hey.

17:08.825 --> 17:11.026
You're up.

17:11.094 --> 17:15.262
Max, this is Cheyenne Matson.

17:15.330 --> 17:17.165
Oh, my God.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.836
I knew I'd see you again someday.

17:22.405 --> 17:23.405
I just knew it.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.607
I found you.

17:27.042 --> 17:28.143
I can't believe it.

17:28.211 --> 17:31.947
Oh. Oh, my baby.

17:38.522 --> 17:40.055
Max.
What?

17:42.092 --> 17:43.459
Stop hugging her, son.

17:43.527 --> 17:44.326
Why?

17:44.394 --> 17:46.228
'Cause she's lying.

17:46.296 --> 17:47.763
She's not your mother.

17:58.763 --> 18:00.731
You don't know what you're talking about.

18:00.798 --> 18:03.133
I gave birth to him in Virginia.

18:03.201 --> 18:05.035
And then I...
See, that's a lie.

18:05.103 --> 18:06.303
What are you gonna do,

18:06.371 --> 18:08.972
you just gonna keep them
coming, or are you done now?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.974
Have you been drinking today?

18:14.145 --> 18:15.679
No, I don't think it's alcohol.

18:15.747 --> 18:17.648
I think it's drugs.

18:17.715 --> 18:18.815
So what was your drug of
choice back in the day.

18:18.883 --> 18:20.317
Was it "X"?

18:20.385 --> 18:22.986
Meth? Coke?

18:23.054 --> 18:24.988
There it is, cocaine.

18:25.056 --> 18:26.790
What did you do? Did you sell him for drugs?

18:26.858 --> 18:27.991
How did you get him?

18:28.059 --> 18:30.227
Ok, ok.

18:30.295 --> 18:32.496
I was on the pipe back then.

18:32.564 --> 18:34.264
I got close with my dealer.

18:34.332 --> 18:37.434
He had this crash pad in D.C.

18:37.502 --> 18:39.503
And I got there and there was this baby.

18:39.571 --> 18:40.470
Who's baby?

18:40.538 --> 18:42.673
I don't know. I don't know.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.475
He was crashing.

18:45.543 --> 18:47.611
And he said he was gonna smother him,

18:47.679 --> 18:49.680
so I took the baby.

18:49.747 --> 18:50.714
You kidnapped him?

18:50.782 --> 18:51.915
You were trying to protect him?

18:51.983 --> 18:54.585
I saw this ad.

18:54.652 --> 18:56.186
These people wanted a baby,

18:56.254 --> 18:58.589
so I said I was his mother.

18:58.656 --> 19:01.291
What was the name of your
drug dealer back in the day?

19:01.359 --> 19:03.961
I only remember him as Romeo.

19:05.463 --> 19:08.465
It was a long time ago.

19:11.369 --> 19:12.869
Of course Max says he's fine.

19:12.937 --> 19:14.738
He's a 16-year-old boy.

19:14.806 --> 19:16.740
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you
have to coddle him, does it?

19:16.808 --> 19:19.076
I mean, a hard truth in the long run

19:19.143 --> 19:21.245
is far better for you than a soft lie.

19:21.312 --> 19:22.312
We are talking about a child.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.780
And what child are we talking about?

19:23.848 --> 19:25.015
Emily.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.918
Foster here disapproves
of my parenting techniques,

19:27.986 --> 19:29.586
which I think is a bit of a cheek, don't you?

19:29.654 --> 19:31.154
Oh, so you're not actually talking about,

19:31.222 --> 19:33.991
let's say, I don't know, an adolescent boy?

19:34.058 --> 19:35.959
No.

19:36.027 --> 19:37.461
Should we be? You?

19:37.528 --> 19:38.962
No.
No.

19:39.030 --> 19:40.931
Then maybe you two
can explain something to me.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.432
Well, I'll do my level best.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.967
All right. Well, try to picture this.

19:44.035 --> 19:47.004
I'm in Hilton Head, eighth hole,
2 under par, best game of my life.

19:47.071 --> 19:50.207
Then all of a sudden I get this call
from my FBI supervisor

19:50.275 --> 19:53.543
wondering if my interest in
16-year-old boys is business

19:53.611 --> 19:56.413
or purely recreational.

19:56.481 --> 19:57.614
And which is it?

19:57.682 --> 19:58.982
Well, see, that's what I'm hoping

19:59.050 --> 20:00.384
that you can help me with.

20:00.451 --> 20:02.619
Because it seems like somebody here in D.C.

20:02.687 --> 20:04.988
used my personal id number and password

20:05.056 --> 20:07.190
to access an FBI database.

20:07.258 --> 20:09.459
But when I'm not actually in D.C.,

20:09.527 --> 20:10.694
That sets off alarms,

20:10.762 --> 20:14.398
so can either of you tell me
who I should blame

20:14.465 --> 20:17.567
for ruining my vacation?

20:20.238 --> 20:21.838
Loker?

20:31.716 --> 20:32.883
Hey.

20:34.886 --> 20:37.754
Sorry, I just... I heard what happened.

20:37.822 --> 20:39.823
Is there anything I can do?

20:39.891 --> 20:42.959
You could stop looking at me like you 
think I'm a freak or screw-up.

20:43.027 --> 20:45.495
I don't think you're screwed up,

20:45.563 --> 20:46.930
I think your family is.

20:46.998 --> 20:48.899
There's a big difference.

20:48.966 --> 20:51.435
Perfect girl with the perfect life's

20:51.502 --> 20:52.969
some expert on messed up families now?

20:53.037 --> 20:56.106
My dad's a human lie detector.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.642
I have a family history of suicide.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.945
And my divorced parents sleep
together sporadically,

21:02.013 --> 21:03.747
fight constantly,

21:03.815 --> 21:06.049
and still insist we get together on holidays.

21:06.117 --> 21:08.285
How's that for perfect?

21:08.353 --> 21:10.587
At least you know who your parents are.

21:10.655 --> 21:12.155
Yeah.

21:12.223 --> 21:16.259
Well, anything I can do to help.

21:16.327 --> 21:20.630
I promise, one freak to another.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.321
You know, I go away for one weekend,

21:28.389 --> 21:30.857
and you two start acting like Bonnie and Clyde.

21:30.925 --> 21:32.759
You're doing Christmas with me.

21:32.827 --> 21:34.093
No one needed to convince me

21:34.161 --> 21:36.429
that bringing the authorities
into this case was a bad idea.

21:36.497 --> 21:37.730
Yeah, well, if you had
come talked to me first,

21:37.798 --> 21:38.765
I could have helped avoid all of this.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.266
Any chance that can happen now?

21:40.334 --> 21:41.701
Because of what these people did,

21:41.769 --> 21:43.736
a kidnapper got away with abducting a baby.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.072
Mr. and Mrs. Roland.

21:46.140 --> 21:47.941
Are you here about Max? Have you seen him?

21:48.008 --> 21:48.942
No, what happened?

21:49.009 --> 21:50.343
He left a note. He ran away.

21:50.411 --> 21:52.579
We have a warrant for your arrests.

21:52.646 --> 21:53.646
Tom.

21:53.714 --> 21:54.914
Being charged with false adoption

21:54.982 --> 21:55.982
and child endangerment.

21:56.050 --> 21:57.784
Come on, let's go.

22:05.726 --> 22:08.528
So, bottom line, they're saying we provoked it,

22:08.596 --> 22:11.197
but they don't have anything concrete.

22:11.265 --> 22:12.632
Just firsthand accounts.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.401
Well, the news footage didn't show anything.

22:15.469 --> 22:17.637
Your security guards, they mention anything

22:17.705 --> 22:20.273
about bullying your customers?

22:20.341 --> 22:23.176
Look. People resent authority.

22:23.244 --> 22:27.180
I get it. My dad was a cop.

22:27.248 --> 22:29.849
Mr. Bernardo, uh...

22:29.917 --> 22:32.485
One of the things we do
is look at body language.

22:32.553 --> 22:36.222
And we've found that sometimes when
people are feeling vulnerable,

22:36.290 --> 22:40.493
they tend to cover their...

22:40.561 --> 22:42.262
gonads.

22:42.329 --> 22:45.164
Can you pull up that photo
you showed me last month?

22:45.232 --> 22:46.833
Rita...
You want me to do it?

22:52.673 --> 22:54.173
Churchill at Yalta... 

22:54.241 --> 22:56.743
Roosevelt and Stalin
are divvying up the world.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.846
Britain's being left out.
The hat placement says it all.

23:01.015 --> 23:03.216
Now...

23:03.284 --> 23:06.619
What is it you're not telling us?

23:07.788 --> 23:09.522
We have some security video

23:09.590 --> 23:11.824
of the parking lot and the storefront.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.626
What does it show?

23:13.694 --> 23:16.429
Things got a little heated between the
guard and some of the customers.

23:16.497 --> 23:19.599
But that was 10 minutes before the stampede.

23:19.667 --> 23:22.268
Well, that's embarrassing,
but it's not a direct cause.

23:22.336 --> 23:24.537
You're trying to bury the evidence?
No.

23:24.605 --> 23:27.473
We don't want the nightmare of
someone posting it online.

23:27.541 --> 23:29.876
But since you signed a non-disclosure agreement,

23:29.944 --> 23:32.078
I'm happy to share it.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.492
Cheyenne's description matches
a former drug dealer on record

23:46.560 --> 23:48.561
who went by the name "Romeo" like she said.

23:48.629 --> 23:51.497
But the guy dropped off the grid a few years ago.

23:51.565 --> 23:54.000
All right.

23:54.068 --> 23:56.302
What did Reynolds say about Max?

23:56.370 --> 23:58.104
There's still no sign of him.

23:58.172 --> 24:00.340
If he's on the run,

24:00.407 --> 24:04.177
first person I'd want to talk to is Emily.

24:04.244 --> 24:07.513
Bad boy fixated in finding the truth... 

24:07.581 --> 24:10.950
She probably feels like
she's known him her whole life.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.888
Hey. They haven't found Max yet.

24:15.956 --> 24:17.890
No? Well, uh,

24:17.958 --> 24:20.393
where are the cops looking for him?

24:20.461 --> 24:21.961
I don't know.

24:22.029 --> 24:23.696
You got any ideas on that?

24:23.764 --> 24:26.065
Oh, sure. He's at the secret hideout

24:26.133 --> 24:28.568
where all the teenage runaways go.

24:30.738 --> 24:34.107
He's just some messed-up kid

24:34.174 --> 24:37.110
who got screwed over.

24:37.177 --> 24:39.112
Uh, you should take that.

24:39.179 --> 24:41.180
Really?
Yeah.

24:41.248 --> 24:44.183
Thanks.

24:44.251 --> 24:46.119
Yeah?

24:46.186 --> 24:49.155
They found Max's biological parents.
They're bringing them in.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.891
Oh, th... that's great.
I mean, that's great, right?

24:51.959 --> 24:54.694
Max is gone, though, and the
state he was in when he ran,

24:54.762 --> 24:58.898
I mean, he could be about to do something
that could ruin his entire future.

24:58.966 --> 25:01.467
I need you.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.880
She knows where Max is.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.882
Hey.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.750
Thanks for that.

25:17.818 --> 25:20.486
Oh, for lying to Emily?
Yeah,

25:20.554 --> 25:22.989
so I wouldn't have to.

25:26.322 --> 25:28.223
All right. Romeo's real name is Ray Blake... 

25:28.291 --> 25:32.260
narcotics distribution, assault,
spent 8 years in prison.

25:32.328 --> 25:34.463
Is there any family who might
know where to find him?

25:34.530 --> 25:37.332
Well, he had a daughter, but she
died while Blake was in prison.

25:39.102 --> 25:42.471
They'll be happy to see you
no matter what...

25:42.538 --> 25:44.239
There he is.

25:44.307 --> 25:45.741
Thank God.

25:45.808 --> 25:47.809
Where are my real parents?
I didn't find them.

25:48.177 --> 25:51.646
Found you, though. Thanks, Em.

25:55.484 --> 25:58.219
Now, I would have expected this kind of
thing from him, but you lied to me.

25:58.287 --> 25:59.721
Oy.
I know.

25:59.789 --> 26:01.890
No, she did what she had to do to help Max.

26:01.957 --> 26:03.825
He was in trouble.
Help him?

26:03.893 --> 26:06.594
You get his parents arrested,
and then you make me lie to him

26:06.662 --> 26:08.663
to get him back here?
He'll be safe here.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.732
Yeah, till you send him off to foster care.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.667
The FBI knows we have him.
We will figure this out.

26:12.735 --> 26:14.803
Now who's he gonna trust?

26:14.870 --> 26:17.872
Did you find Blake?

26:17.940 --> 26:21.209
All we've got is his old parole officer. That's it.

26:25.047 --> 26:27.048
Foster, come on.

26:34.857 --> 26:36.825
Mr. Donnelly, you were the parole officer

26:36.892 --> 26:38.760
for a convict named Ray Blake, right?

26:38.828 --> 26:40.595
In my old life.

26:40.663 --> 26:43.531
Ray Blake? Yeah, he was a drug peddler.

26:43.599 --> 26:46.167
Used to go by the name of Romeo.

26:46.235 --> 26:48.303
No logical reason why.

26:48.371 --> 26:50.805
Do you have any idea
where we could find him now?

26:51.807 --> 26:53.641
Creep was a gambler.

26:53.709 --> 26:58.146
OTB in Bethesda was about the only place
I could ever count on finding him.

26:59.515 --> 27:02.617
You seem a little angry about your past life.

27:02.685 --> 27:05.820
What, you didn't like being
a parole officer then?

27:05.888 --> 27:08.656
You know, my old boss sent me
to the department shrink.

27:08.724 --> 27:10.692
I don't think I need another one.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.795
How'd you end up in that chair?

27:13.863 --> 27:16.531
That's a little personal. Don't you think?

27:16.599 --> 27:18.633
Yeah, very personal, I'd say.

27:18.701 --> 27:21.669
I got a game to get back to.

27:21.737 --> 27:23.271
Hey!

27:23.339 --> 27:26.441
Look. Either you did something
really bad back then

27:26.509 --> 27:30.011
or something really bad was
done to you. Which was it?

27:30.079 --> 27:31.880
That's none of your business.
Yeah, it is.

27:31.947 --> 27:33.882
This is important.

27:36.886 --> 27:38.853
Fine. 16 years ago,

27:38.921 --> 27:41.623
somebody broke into my house, killed my wife,

27:41.690 --> 27:45.126
put a bullet in my back, and stole our baby son.

27:49.565 --> 27:51.666
Ok, I broke the crowd into sectors.

27:51.734 --> 27:53.635
I followed 6 people at a time

27:53.702 --> 27:55.236
from the minute they showed
up till the riot started.

27:55.304 --> 27:57.605
You find someone to pin it on?

27:57.673 --> 28:00.108
Watch this guy.

28:00.176 --> 28:02.210
He moves through the crowd.
This guy grabs him,

28:02.278 --> 28:03.945
pulls him back. A second later,

28:04.013 --> 28:06.214
the sectors behind him surge forward.

28:06.282 --> 28:08.349
Mob mentality takes over.

28:08.417 --> 28:10.418
Who do you think was in that stampede?

28:10.486 --> 28:12.187
They weren't peace-loving hippies, but... 

28:12.254 --> 28:14.122
Working people, Loker... 

28:14.190 --> 28:17.358
Parents who can afford game systems
and mp3 players one day a year.

28:17.426 --> 28:19.527
They're so desperate to make their kids happy, 

28:19.595 --> 28:21.463
they wake up at 4 a.m. just to stand in line.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.031
Yeah, you're proving my point.

28:23.098 --> 28:25.333
Contagion theory says crowds
infect the people in them.

28:25.401 --> 28:28.069
Ok, you can dress it up with science
all you want. It's still an agenda.

28:28.137 --> 28:30.271
You're trying to impress Lightman.

28:30.339 --> 28:33.341
If I bring home 7 figures, he has to respect that.

28:33.409 --> 28:36.411
Loker, I don't know why Lightman
screws with you the way he does

28:36.479 --> 28:38.580
or why he's got it in for you.

28:38.647 --> 28:41.115
But I wouldn't get my hopes up
about things changing.

28:41.183 --> 28:43.251
Let's take Lightman out of it.

28:43.319 --> 28:45.653
This video does not lie.

28:45.721 --> 28:48.590
Let's go see the guy and see who's right.

28:51.293 --> 28:53.328
Why were you cutting the line?

28:53.395 --> 28:57.198
Someone said the doors were opening.
Guess I got excited.

28:57.266 --> 29:00.768
Well, the look on your face isn't excitement.

29:00.836 --> 29:02.770
It's not even aggression.

29:02.838 --> 29:05.440
That's panic.

29:06.008 --> 29:09.443
You were afraid, before the
stampede even started.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.748
My daughter...

29:13.815 --> 29:16.851
I told her to stay close.
And when I heard her crying... 

29:16.918 --> 29:19.620
Look, it's every parent's worst nightmare.

29:19.688 --> 29:22.289
Then the crowd started moving
before I could get to her.

29:22.357 --> 29:24.558
Is she ok?
She got knocked down.

29:24.626 --> 29:26.394
Her arm's broken in 3 places.

29:26.461 --> 29:28.629
I don't know what we're gonna
do about her hospital bills.

29:28.697 --> 29:32.066
Well, she wasn't hurt in that
stampede, like you've claimed.

29:32.134 --> 29:34.602
It happened before that, didn't it?

29:34.669 --> 29:37.138
You think I hurt her?
No.

29:37.205 --> 29:40.841
But I do think that you are an opportunist.

29:43.879 --> 29:46.213
Look, just tell us the truth.
How did she break her arm?

29:46.281 --> 29:49.650
It wasn't in the stampede, was it?

29:49.718 --> 29:51.819
She fell.

29:53.088 --> 29:55.256
When I heard her crying, I panicked.

29:55.323 --> 29:56.857
I went looking for her.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.760
And the crowd thought that you
were breaking its first rule... 

29:59.828 --> 30:02.096
Don't cut the line.

30:02.164 --> 30:04.732
Or they saw you moving forward and
assumed the doors were opening.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.668
Either way, what they couldn't
contemplate in that state of mind

30:07.736 --> 30:10.204
was a father rushing to help his daughter.

30:10.272 --> 30:12.506
Ok, so what happened,

30:12.574 --> 30:14.842
those people who died...

30:14.910 --> 30:16.911
it was my fault?

30:18.780 --> 30:21.115
He turned up this week.

30:23.351 --> 30:26.654
Are you saying that you
might have found my son?

30:26.721 --> 30:28.556
Alive?

30:37.199 --> 30:39.166
That was his photo.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.005
But they cleared all my parolees.

30:45.073 --> 30:47.007
Well, Blake fooled them, apparently.

30:47.075 --> 30:49.710
When was the last time you saw Blake?

30:49.778 --> 30:53.147
Maybe a year or two before
that night, maybe more.

30:53.215 --> 30:57.118
I... I'd given him a random
drug test that he failed.

30:57.185 --> 31:00.955
Well, that's what sent him back to prison.

31:01.022 --> 31:04.925
Blake's daughter died while he
was serving that sentence.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.828
I think he blamed you
for breaking up his family.

31:07.896 --> 31:09.864
He left you to live with the pain,

31:09.931 --> 31:12.399
just like he felt you did to him.

31:15.804 --> 31:18.139
Whatever. The...

31:18.206 --> 31:20.841
The only thing that matters now is my son.

31:20.909 --> 31:24.512
So, what, if the DNA matches, he'll come home?

31:24.579 --> 31:26.647
That's not up to us.

31:26.715 --> 31:30.117
Well, I've waited 16 years for this.

31:32.521 --> 31:35.756
If that's my son, I want him back.

31:40.735 --> 31:42.669
Hey. I think we can put a bow on this one.

31:42.737 --> 31:44.504
The man in the crowd started the Stampede.

31:44.572 --> 31:45.339
Well, shouldn't we find out

31:45.407 --> 31:47.374
about Ken's daughter before the Stampede?

31:47.442 --> 31:49.276
Is that why we were hired?
No.

31:49.344 --> 31:51.712
I think the client's gonna be
happy with your findings.

31:51.780 --> 31:54.114
They will be ecstatic. It'll save 'em millions.

31:54.182 --> 31:56.750
And it's a pretty big payday for us.

31:56.818 --> 31:58.752
Well, I think you should
take some of this windfall

31:58.820 --> 32:01.455
and have yourself a little
celebration, both of you.

32:01.523 --> 32:03.791
Really?
Yeah.

32:03.858 --> 32:08.462
As nauseating as it is for me
to say this to you, Loker...

32:08.530 --> 32:10.364
Well done.

32:22.444 --> 32:26.180
Hey. I got us the last table at Marcelli's, 8:00.

32:26.247 --> 32:29.016
We're going big.
I'm gonna pass.

32:29.084 --> 32:31.585
Lightman buying dinner is unprecedented.

32:38.493 --> 32:40.394
These families deserve to know

32:40.462 --> 32:42.663
why their loved ones
died in a parking lot, Loker.

32:42.731 --> 32:44.331
Look, we know what happened.

32:44.399 --> 32:46.934
Some customers blindly followed
when Ken pushed forward.

32:47.001 --> 32:48.902
The others didn't want to be displaced.

32:48.970 --> 32:51.171
Either way, Ken was the stimulus.

32:51.239 --> 32:53.040
How did his daughter break her arm?

32:53.108 --> 32:55.509
I've been through the tapes dozens of times,

32:55.577 --> 32:58.312
before the stampede and after.

32:58.380 --> 33:00.381
There's no evidence.

33:00.448 --> 33:02.383
Then have a nice dinner.

33:28.977 --> 33:31.345
Hey. Taxi!

33:36.818 --> 33:38.752
Whoa. I got you.

33:57.005 --> 33:58.972
What's that glare?

33:59.040 --> 34:00.040
Where?

34:01.409 --> 34:03.544
Right there, that light
coming off the asphalt?

34:03.611 --> 34:06.580
Yeah. What is that?

34:17.257 --> 34:18.292
Hey.

34:18.359 --> 34:20.893
You want to meet your father?

34:22.630 --> 34:24.831
Oh, here they are.

34:24.899 --> 34:26.800
Hey.

34:26.868 --> 34:30.103
Max, this is your biological father

34:30.170 --> 34:32.339
John Donnelly.

34:34.242 --> 34:37.511
John... meet your son.

34:42.984 --> 34:44.685
Hi.

34:49.456 --> 34:52.025
You have your mother's eyes.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.868
Owen...

35:00.935 --> 35:03.370
Your name is Owen.

35:08.409 --> 35:11.912
Is there anything you want to ask your father?

35:15.149 --> 35:17.651
I play music.

35:18.586 --> 35:20.854
I don't know why I said that.

35:20.922 --> 35:24.291
I'd love to hear you play sometime.

35:24.359 --> 35:26.827
Do you know anything about music?

35:26.895 --> 35:30.631
I don't. Heh.

35:32.534 --> 35:35.269
You like hockey, right, Mr. Donnelly?

35:35.336 --> 35:37.271
Yes. Yes. Yes.

35:37.338 --> 35:40.107
I have season tickets for the Capitals.

35:40.174 --> 35:42.109
We could go next week.

35:42.176 --> 35:44.745
Uh, for your birthday.

35:46.114 --> 35:48.715
Well, my birthday is in April.

35:48.783 --> 35:52.286
And I don't play hockey anymore.

35:52.353 --> 35:54.254
I quit.

35:54.322 --> 35:56.290
Well, we... we don't have to go.

35:56.357 --> 35:57.958
Yeah, you have the wrong person.

35:58.026 --> 36:00.594
Hey, careful, son.

36:03.331 --> 36:05.232
I'm your father, Owen.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.435
No, this isn't my dad.

36:15.810 --> 36:17.210
Max?

36:17.278 --> 36:19.780
He doesn't even know who I am.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.748
He loves you. He has this whole time.

36:21.816 --> 36:23.617
He just couldn't find you.

36:23.685 --> 36:25.953
No, you got the people
who really love me arrested.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.355
Give him a chance.

36:28.423 --> 36:30.524
All right? He wants you in his life.

36:30.592 --> 36:32.826
I don't want him.
Finally, the truth.

36:32.894 --> 36:34.661
Cal...
No, he needs to hear it.

36:34.729 --> 36:36.830
That man in there, that's what you have.

36:36.898 --> 36:39.099
So, deal with it.

36:39.167 --> 36:41.034
Max, we care about you.

36:41.102 --> 36:42.769
I'm not your kid. Ok?

36:42.837 --> 36:44.938
You want a kid, go have one of your own.

36:45.006 --> 36:47.808
Want to lash out, do you? Well, go ahead.

36:47.875 --> 36:50.043
Give me your best shot.

36:53.715 --> 36:56.216
Come on. Give me your best shot.

36:58.620 --> 37:00.554
Come on, then. Come on!

37:09.864 --> 37:11.965
Is that enough?

37:12.033 --> 37:14.301
Attaboy. Attaboy.

37:14.369 --> 37:17.037
That enough? Attaboy.

37:18.139 --> 37:19.806
We're working out the details, but it looks like

37:19.874 --> 37:21.308
the settlement will be
more in the neighborhood

37:21.376 --> 37:23.543
of 2 million, not 20 million.

37:26.314 --> 37:29.683
Your findings were worth every penny.

37:33.621 --> 37:35.288
1.8 million...

37:35.356 --> 37:37.958
That's a lot of zeroes.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.960
Ok. Before we take this, uh,

37:40.027 --> 37:43.229
we have a couple of outstanding questions.

37:45.933 --> 37:49.202
Uh, what are your protocols
for dealing with ice?

37:49.270 --> 37:50.537
We salt.

37:50.604 --> 37:54.039
You salted the parking lots
and the sidewalks that morning?

37:54.107 --> 37:55.975
I'll show you the inventory if you'd like.

37:56.042 --> 37:57.943
That won't be necessary.

37:58.878 --> 38:01.080
Classic evasion.

38:01.147 --> 38:04.416
And you know what? We'll pass
on the bogus paper trail.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.552
If Ken's daughter doesn't slip on the ice,

38:06.619 --> 38:08.320
he never pushes through the crowd.

38:08.388 --> 38:10.522
Couple that with your security guard's negligence

38:10.590 --> 38:12.391
and the mindset of the crowd,

38:12.459 --> 38:14.360
you've got a perfect storm.

38:14.427 --> 38:17.663
If you're looking to renegotiate,

38:17.731 --> 38:19.565
we can do that.

38:21.534 --> 38:23.235
This is what we found.

38:23.303 --> 38:26.472
Then I'm glad we have
a non-disclosure agreement.

38:30.276 --> 38:32.644
You can use the whole report or none of it.

38:32.712 --> 38:35.481
Or I'll see that it leaks.

38:35.548 --> 38:39.318
And then you'll have
a tragedy and a cover-up.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.129
We'll use none of it.

38:58.471 --> 39:02.074
He can see me, can't he? Donnelly?

39:02.142 --> 39:04.109
Yeah.

39:04.177 --> 39:09.348
I came peacefully so he could see me.

39:09.416 --> 39:11.483
Where did you find him?

39:11.551 --> 39:13.218
He was outside of a liquor store,

39:13.286 --> 39:14.953
next to the OTB that Donnelly mentioned.

39:15.021 --> 39:18.057
It'll take a few weeks for the
FBI to confirm their DNA test.

39:18.124 --> 39:20.025
Yeah, but if we can get a confession today,

39:20.093 --> 39:22.227
you can go home with your father.

39:25.965 --> 39:28.200
Your daughter was taken

39:28.268 --> 39:30.536
from you when she was...

39:30.603 --> 39:33.138
6, right? And she died in foster care?

39:36.876 --> 39:40.279
You've been waiting for this
day, haven't you, Mr. Blake?

39:40.346 --> 39:43.115
You think the best thing you could
have done for your daughter

39:43.183 --> 39:46.118
was to avenge her death by stealing the son

39:46.186 --> 39:47.686
of the man responsible.

39:47.754 --> 39:51.023
He should have let me keep her.

39:51.091 --> 39:53.192
I begged him.

39:54.894 --> 39:57.629
You are going to jail for the rest of your life.

39:57.697 --> 39:59.965
You know that, right?

40:00.033 --> 40:02.634
What do you want me to say?

40:02.702 --> 40:05.370
The question really is, what do you want to say...

40:05.438 --> 40:09.141
to Donnelly before you disappear?

40:13.880 --> 40:16.648
My only regret through this whole thing

40:16.716 --> 40:20.085
is that you didn't know who did this to you.

40:22.522 --> 40:24.756
Now you do.

40:27.627 --> 40:29.228
So does his son.

40:29.295 --> 40:30.295
What?

40:30.363 --> 40:32.965
The boy found him. His son found him.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.301
They're strangers.

40:37.403 --> 40:39.905
Yeah, well, give them time, eh?

40:51.050 --> 40:53.085
You want to tell me how we
went from a 7-figure payday

40:53.153 --> 40:55.020
to nothing?
It wasn't an ideal outcome...

40:55.088 --> 40:57.556
No, it wasn't. We can barely keep
our heads above water.

40:57.624 --> 41:01.059
You decide to go ahead and sabotage
a potential elephant account.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.261
I mean, what did you do?

41:02.328 --> 41:04.363
You put in 40 full hours on this?

41:04.430 --> 41:06.431
And then there's Torres' time?

41:06.499 --> 41:08.433
You have any idea where that's coming from?

41:08.501 --> 41:10.169
Your pocket.
Bloody right, my pocket!

41:10.236 --> 41:11.970
You promised me you'd deliver.

41:12.038 --> 41:13.906
Shifting blame from the guilty party...

41:13.973 --> 41:16.074
That wouldn't have been the truth.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.143
You see, that choice...

41:18.211 --> 41:19.878
That choice...

41:19.946 --> 41:23.448
That's how you make your
contribution to this firm.

41:23.516 --> 41:26.118
We could go dark, for all I care.

41:26.186 --> 41:28.353
We follow the truth here. Right?

41:28.421 --> 41:30.822
No matter the cost to our egos or our wallets.

41:30.890 --> 41:33.959
So, if I'd have taken the money...

41:34.027 --> 41:36.728
I would have sacked you.

41:36.796 --> 41:39.665
Hey, can I get one of those "attaboy"
speeches from yesterday?

41:39.732 --> 41:41.633
I've run out.

41:44.070 --> 41:46.738
You think this co-custody
thing can really work?

41:46.806 --> 41:49.374
2 sets of parents is better than none.

41:49.442 --> 41:52.277
This is so screwed up.

41:52.345 --> 41:55.547
Just give it a chance. It'll work itself out.

41:55.615 --> 41:58.450
When in doubt, I just do what she says.

42:07.093 --> 42:09.561
Go on. Off you go, son.

42:24.510 --> 42:27.012
Hell of a rabbit hole.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.281
We made it.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.791
So, have you forgiven us?

42:39.859 --> 42:41.893
I guess. Have you?

42:41.961 --> 42:44.329
Well, you were protecting a friend, right?

42:44.397 --> 42:47.532
So, you are your father's daughter.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.969
Well, I know a little bit about
how crazy families can be.

42:52.305 --> 42:54.172
You think he'll be all right?

42:54.240 --> 42:56.642
Don't know.

42:58.778 --> 43:00.579
Hope so.

43:02.882 --> 43:05.717
Maybe we should invite him
to Thanksgiving next year.

43:05.785 --> 43:08.487
He'd fit right in with us.

43:08.554 --> 43:09.356
Yeah.
