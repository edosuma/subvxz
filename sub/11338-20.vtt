WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:03.366
911. What's your emergency?

00:03.717 --> 00:03.366
911 Dispatch Center TALL
TALLAHASSEE, Florida

00:03.367 --> 00:05.273
Ma'am, you need to calm down.

00:05.274 --> 00:06.761
Yes, sir, we have
units on the way.

00:06.762 --> 00:07.822
Please stay on the line with me

00:07.823 --> 00:09.022
And give me your full name.

00:09.023 --> 00:09.834
Stand by, Charlie 2-5,

00:09.835 --> 00:11.526
I still have the
complainant on the line.

00:11.527 --> 00:12.994
911. What's your emergency?

00:12.995 --> 00:15.630
Ma'am, the police are knocking
on the door right now.

00:15.631 --> 00:16.731
911. What is your emergency?

00:16.732 --> 00:18.600
Yes, that is a real
police officer outside.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.002
911. What's your emergency?

00:21.003 --> 00:24.005
Ma'am, you need to calm
down and stop yelling.

00:24.006 --> 00:26.341
Yes, sir, we have
a unit on the way.

00:26.342 --> 00:29.310
Please stay on the line.
Please give me your full name.

00:29.311 --> 00:31.279
911. What's your emergency?

00:31.280 --> 00:34.053
There's a dead body
in the warehouse.

00:34.054 --> 00:35.717
Excuse me, sir?

00:35.718 --> 00:39.372
There's a dead body in the
warehouse in Crawfordville.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.390
Can you be more specific about
the location of that warehouse?

00:42.391 --> 00:45.927
West of Crawfordville highway,
South of woodland.

00:45.928 --> 00:47.748
A dirt road.

00:47.749 --> 00:47.806
Report of a dead body.

00:47.807 --> 00:49.897
Do you have an address?

00:51.345 --> 00:52.779
No.

00:54.015 --> 00:57.384
Charlie 44, role to location
of possible dead body.

00:57.385 --> 00:59.826
Is someone on the way?

00:59.827 --> 01:02.473
Yes, but I need you to stay
on the line with me, sir.

01:02.474 --> 01:04.349
Are you sure the
victim is dead, sir?

01:04.351 --> 01:06.558
He will be in a second.

01:06.559 --> 01:09.046
Excuse me?

01:11.016 --> 01:12.550
Sir? Sir!

01:13.079 --> 01:15.358
Charlie 44,
we have shots fired now.

01:15.359 --> 01:18.760
I repeat, shots fired.
I'm not sure what's going on in there,

01:18.761 --> 01:20.854
But I no longer have contact
with the complainant.

01:20.855 --> 01:23.856
Advise and use extreme caution.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.193 --> 02:02.995
This is Charlie 44.
We're on scene.

02:02.996 --> 02:05.364
It's quiet out front.

02:05.365 --> 02:06.593
We're moving in.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.721
10-4. Use caution.
Ems is on the way, too.

02:20.647 --> 02:22.815
Eyes open, Ray.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.733
State police!

02:44.366 --> 02:47.155
State police! Open the door!

02:55.849 --> 02:58.044
Police!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.122
You, in the chair!

03:04.123 --> 03:07.359
Stand up and let
me see your hands.

03:10.787 --> 03:14.399
Last chance, man! Stand up!

03:26.628 --> 03:28.680
[gags] lord have mercy.

03:31.138 --> 03:32.703
Do not blow dinner, Ray.

03:32.704 --> 03:34.205
I'm OK.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.196
I mean it. You need
to outside, you go.

03:37.197 --> 03:38.941
I said I'm fine.

03:38.942 --> 03:43.063
This is Charlie 44. You can cancel
That ems out here, dispatch.

03:43.064 --> 03:44.864
Are you sure, 44?

03:44.865 --> 03:47.679
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.977
This looks to be a
successful suicide.

03:50.978 --> 03:53.564
10-4.

03:54.707 --> 03:58.010
What the hell...

03:58.011 --> 03:59.278
Got a light.

04:09.003 --> 04:11.705
Oh, man, take a
look at this, Tommy.

04:16.402 --> 04:18.648
These women all dead?

04:21.423 --> 04:24.325
Doesn't say this one's
every been found.

04:24.326 --> 04:26.098
I recognize that name.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.082
She only went missing 3 weeks ago.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.022
This is 44 again.

04:33.023 --> 04:37.020
Uh, we're gonna need bosses,
detectives,

04:37.021 --> 04:39.941
Crime scene out
here on the double.

04:40.886 --> 04:43.444
Ah, hell, just...

04:46.333 --> 04:48.570
Send everybody.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.517
Tell me what the dress is about.

04:50.518 --> 04:52.808
Hey, have a good weekend, JJ.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.097
Sorry.

04:55.082 --> 04:57.120
There goes my beach house rental.

04:57.121 --> 05:00.333
And my non-refundable
sin to win weekend

05:00.334 --> 05:01.774
In Atlantic city.

05:01.775 --> 05:04.247
Sin to win?

05:04.248 --> 05:05.211
Yeah.

05:05.212 --> 05:08.414
And I always win big.

05:08.415 --> 05:11.050
I didn't have any plans.

05:14.621 --> 05:16.344
Hey, uh, these were
just faxed to me.

05:16.345 --> 05:17.921
I talked to a
Tallahassee Detective

05:17.922 --> 05:19.578
who's been working
a missing coed--

05:19.579 --> 05:21.563
Rebecca Daniels-
she went missing while jogging

05:21.564 --> 05:23.625
Near the FSU campus 3 weeks ago.

05:23.626 --> 05:24.688
Who's this?

05:24.689 --> 05:26.123
Florida state police responded

05:26.124 --> 05:28.561
To an apparent suicide
an hour and a half ago.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.497
Middle-aged male. Those are
photos of him postmortem.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.599
What's with the tattoos?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.001
Yeah, he's covered in them,
almost completely.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.003
That's why they
requested our presence.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.121
The tattoos are portraits
of previously missing women,

05:40.122 --> 05:43.343
With the years of death or the years
the remains were recovered, anyway.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.469
The tattoos correlate to faces
on a wall next to the body,

05:46.470 --> 05:49.282
With information on the
women going back 10 years.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.397
Rebecca is also
shown on that wall,

05:51.398 --> 05:53.417
But there's no image
of her on the body.

05:53.418 --> 05:56.923
The Detective thinks that that may
mean that she's alive somewhere.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.025
He called in his own suicide,
didn't he?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.066
Yeah. How did you--

06:00.067 --> 06:01.769
He staged all this.

06:01.770 --> 06:04.397
No reason to put on a
show without an audience.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.938
Tell them to leave
the body where it is.

06:05.939 --> 06:08.267
We need to see it exactly
how he wanted it seen.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.122
If this girl's still out there,

06:09.123 --> 06:11.437
The only one who knows
where she is may be dead.

06:57.645 --> 07:00.369
"a sincere artist tries
to create something

07:00.370 --> 07:03.850
Which is in itself
a living thing."

07:03.851 --> 07:05.852
Painter William Dobell.

07:10.124 --> 07:12.392
Oh, this heat is brutal.

07:12.393 --> 07:15.028
You know, it isn't so much the
heat as it is the humidity.

07:15.029 --> 07:16.586
At some point it doesn't
matter how you look at it.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.331
It all sucks.

07:24.305 --> 07:25.769
- FBI?
- Yes, sir.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.573
Hi, John Barton, Tallahassee pd.

07:27.574 --> 07:30.644
I'm the primary on the missing girl,
Rebecca Daniels.

07:30.645 --> 07:32.546
I got my files in the
car if you need them.

07:32.547 --> 07:35.048
I'm Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Rossi, Agent Prentiss,

07:35.049 --> 07:36.783
Dr. Reid, Agent Morgan,
Agent Jareau.

07:36.784 --> 07:38.031
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.585
Yeah, hey, thanks a lot
for coming out so quickly.

07:39.586 --> 07:40.381
I appreciate that.

07:40.382 --> 07:42.022
I've also confirmed
that all the women

07:42.023 --> 07:44.224
Are victims from
around the southeast--

07:44.225 --> 07:46.123
Florida, Louisiana,
Georgia, Alabama.

07:46.124 --> 07:47.971
And Rebecca's the
only woman on the wall

07:47.972 --> 07:49.510
Who's not represented on his body?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.624
Yeah, she's the only one.

07:51.625 --> 07:55.268
Hope you have a strong stomach.

08:03.077 --> 08:04.218
The chair was turned like that?

08:04.219 --> 08:05.593
This is exactly
where you found him?

08:05.594 --> 08:07.449
Yeah.

08:08.516 --> 08:10.378
Talk about staging.

08:10.379 --> 08:11.842
Talk about ego.

08:11.843 --> 08:14.490
There's also a couple
boxes with journals

08:14.491 --> 08:16.206
Or composition books.
They're filled with writing.

08:16.207 --> 08:19.101
We haven't been through them yet
Other than to dust them for prints.

08:19.102 --> 08:20.490
Have you identified him?

08:20.491 --> 08:21.568
We're working on it.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.504
Uh, we got a rush on
the DNA and the prints.

08:23.505 --> 08:24.971
He's cleared locally,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.458
But it's gonna take some time
to get the national records.

08:27.459 --> 08:29.031
What about property records?

08:29.032 --> 08:30.405
Talked to the owner.

08:30.406 --> 08:32.350
She said she rented
it a couple weeks ago

08:32.351 --> 08:35.009
To a quiet, normal-looking
guy named Bob.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.711
He said he wanted to
store some equipment,

08:36.712 --> 08:38.078
And he paid in cash.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.547
They're always normal.

08:39.548 --> 08:40.909
No lease?

08:40.910 --> 08:43.049
Uh, month to month, no.
Out here in the boonies

08:43.051 --> 08:45.391
You don't get a lot of, uh,
record-keeping types.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.687
Especially when it comes to
cash transactions, I'll bet.

08:47.688 --> 08:50.322
He's no kid,
yet the missings go back

08:50.323 --> 08:51.490
Only 10 years?

08:51.491 --> 08:52.733
As far as I could tell.

08:52.734 --> 08:54.993
Late bloomer.

08:54.994 --> 08:56.629
You see this a lot, uh,

08:56.630 --> 08:58.398
These guys killing themselves?

08:58.399 --> 09:00.330
Most serial killers
who commit suicide

09:00.331 --> 09:02.523
Do it in prison after
they're caught.

09:02.524 --> 09:04.042
JJ, gather as much information

09:04.043 --> 09:05.961
About the prior
victims as you can.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.999
Morgan and Prentiss,
take the journals.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.511
Dave, you and Reid, the tattoos.

09:09.512 --> 09:13.071
See if he left any clues about
where miss Daniels might be.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.440
You think there's a chance
she might still be alive?

09:15.441 --> 09:17.446
It's probably better
not to speculate.

09:17.447 --> 09:19.453
May I take a look at the case
files you have on miss Daniels?

09:19.454 --> 09:21.604
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

09:21.605 --> 09:23.857
He was on the phone
with dispatch and then,

09:23.858 --> 09:24.833
Boom.

09:26.915 --> 09:28.869
Must be what, 15 feet?

09:28.870 --> 09:32.039
Consummate overachiever.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.041
Oh. Right.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.912
Right.

09:35.913 --> 09:37.795
Why is it when men
kill themselves,

09:37.796 --> 09:40.023
It gets everywhere,
but women don't leave a mess,

09:40.024 --> 09:42.015
Like they were never there?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.848
Women worry about
who has to clean up.

09:44.849 --> 09:46.507
Men don't give a damn.

09:46.508 --> 09:48.327
JJ, what have you found?

09:48.328 --> 09:50.831
The earliest clipping
is from 10 years ago,

09:50.832 --> 09:53.370
And they're in order,
oldest to newest.

09:53.371 --> 09:56.311
Brenda Carlyle first,
Rebecca Daniels last.

09:56.312 --> 09:57.773
That was thoughtful of him.

09:57.774 --> 09:59.862
One victim a year for
10 years straight.

09:59.863 --> 10:01.324
Each girl's remains were recovered

10:01.325 --> 10:03.838
In a well-traveled wooded area.

10:03.839 --> 10:06.570
Strangled, repeatedly
sexually assaulted,

10:06.571 --> 10:08.162
And then about a week later,

10:08.163 --> 10:09.774
Another woman goes missing.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.208
Did the new abductions happen

10:11.209 --> 10:12.943
Before the previous
body's been found?

10:12.944 --> 10:14.245
No, never.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.080
So he has a year-long cycle.

10:16.081 --> 10:19.016
He uses them up and
he gets a newer model.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.918
But he won't take another girl

10:20.919 --> 10:22.920
Until the last body's been found.

10:22.921 --> 10:25.256
He's telling a story and
he can't start a new one

10:25.257 --> 10:27.076
Until the old one's over.

10:27.077 --> 10:28.840
Look at that. At the
turn of the 16th century,

10:28.841 --> 10:31.971
Rose tattoos were put on men
who were sentenced to death.

10:31.972 --> 10:32.569
Really?

10:32.570 --> 10:34.571
Yeah. If they escaped,
it served to identify them.

10:34.572 --> 10:37.374
But now roses pretty
much symbolize pure love.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.576
Pure love. Right
before he kills them.

10:39.577 --> 10:41.287
Hey, have you read
"the illustrated man"?

10:41.288 --> 10:42.112
Nope.

10:42.113 --> 10:43.945
Oh, it's amazing.
It's a collection of short stories

10:43.946 --> 10:46.026
By Ray Bradbury,
based on the metafictive device

10:46.027 --> 10:48.819
Of a man who's covered in tattoos
drawn by a woman from the future.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.820
Uh-huh. - At nighttime,
the tattoos come to life

10:50.821 --> 10:52.456
And tell a story.
It's pretty awesome.

10:52.457 --> 10:54.888
These do tell a story.

10:54.889 --> 10:57.675
Oh, you want to see something?

11:01.024 --> 11:03.725
Huh. A space in the tree.

11:03.726 --> 11:05.415
And there's no date on that one.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.367
Why would he leave
that space blank?

11:07.368 --> 11:09.659
Maybe this guy's just a psycho.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.662
If it were that simple,
we'd all be out of a job.

11:15.566 --> 11:16.733
Hey, Reid.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.003
What's up?

11:20.900 --> 11:23.740
Our man here was a
prolific journaler.

11:23.741 --> 11:26.103
With teeny tiny handwriting.

11:26.104 --> 11:27.625
He probably had
counseling at some point

11:27.626 --> 11:29.451
When journaling was
part of his therapy.

11:29.452 --> 11:31.864
That's what we were thinking.

11:32.935 --> 11:34.102
And?

11:34.103 --> 11:36.015
And, uh, Well, you know,
the two of us,

11:36.016 --> 11:40.169
It would take us like 3 days
to read all of this stuff.

11:42.084 --> 11:43.844
You guys owe me.

11:53.923 --> 11:56.858
It's no wonder no one has
ever connected these cases.

11:56.859 --> 11:58.393
They're from different states,

11:58.394 --> 11:59.661
Different jurisdictions.

11:59.662 --> 12:01.215
It's probably no accident.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.631
He knows the system.

12:03.811 --> 12:05.867
Why kill himself now?

12:05.868 --> 12:08.136
He wasn't on anyone's radar.

12:08.137 --> 12:10.138
Something changed.

12:10.139 --> 12:12.273
Let's gather everyone.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.775
So what do we know so far?

12:13.776 --> 12:15.312
He wanted the police here.

12:15.313 --> 12:17.545
He wanted us to see all this.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.206
He was definitely a sadist.
From what we saw,

12:19.207 --> 12:21.179
His journals were
graphic and meticulous.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.115
Covering himself with
his victims' likeness

12:23.116 --> 12:26.475
Is methodical, possessive.
He'll always own them.

12:26.476 --> 12:28.697
And the suicide shows commitment.

12:28.698 --> 12:29.732
He's organized and compulsive.

12:29.733 --> 12:32.065
The crimes are on an annual cycle.

12:32.066 --> 12:33.535
Computer printouts on the board,

12:33.536 --> 12:35.070
They were all printed
on the same day--

12:35.071 --> 12:36.071
2 weeks ago.

12:36.072 --> 12:37.468
That's when he
rented this building.

12:37.469 --> 12:38.802
And proceeded to move
everything into it.

12:38.803 --> 12:39.770
It's a history of his crimes.

12:39.771 --> 12:42.239
So he did all of this in 2 weeks.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.674
He got away with it for 10 years.

12:43.675 --> 12:44.908
He could have kept going.

12:44.909 --> 12:46.944
But he decides to end it all

12:46.945 --> 12:48.879
And hand everything to us.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.438
That's it--everything.

12:50.439 --> 12:51.974
Everything. Reid?

12:51.975 --> 12:53.784
Everything. His body,
the tattoos, the clippings,

12:53.785 --> 12:56.587
The printout, the journals.
He moved it all into one room.

12:56.588 --> 12:58.455
He wanted us to see all of it.
See all of him--

12:58.456 --> 13:01.530
His work--the women,
he put them in chronological order.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.342
He's screaming, "look at me."

13:03.343 --> 13:04.295
We all got that.

13:04.296 --> 13:05.223
No, but think about it.

13:05.224 --> 13:07.658
If you take a step back,
it sort of makes sense.

13:07.659 --> 13:08.723
It's just a confession.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.657
A giant, flashy confession.

13:10.658 --> 13:13.343
What would we say if an unsub
turned himself in to the police

13:13.344 --> 13:14.461
Before they were even onto him?

13:14.462 --> 13:16.231
That he was trying
to hide something.

13:16.232 --> 13:18.020
Or someone.

13:18.571 --> 13:19.900
He made a mistake-
in his third book.

13:19.901 --> 13:21.468
I almost missed it,
but then I caught it.

13:21.469 --> 13:22.903
"I thought it would take longer,

13:22.904 --> 13:24.504
"but today was the lucky day.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.373
"she almost walked right by,

13:26.374 --> 13:27.397
"almost missed her completely,

13:27.398 --> 13:28.775
"but at the last moment,

13:28.776 --> 13:31.078
We found our latest guest."

13:31.079 --> 13:32.579
We.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.870
He has a partner.

13:34.871 --> 13:37.766
He put everything in this room
So we wouldn't look further,

13:37.767 --> 13:39.519
Wouldn't dig even deeper.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.164
If he has a partner,
he's still out there,

13:41.165 --> 13:42.856
And he's got Rebecca Daniels.

14:18.359 --> 14:20.260
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

14:20.261 --> 14:21.835
I was calling out,

14:21.836 --> 14:23.317
But I guess your
music was too loud.

14:23.318 --> 14:24.164
Are you all right?

14:24.165 --> 14:25.819
I'm fine. It's all right.

14:25.820 --> 14:26.940
Juliet Monroe?

14:26.941 --> 14:29.156
That's me. That's for you.

14:29.157 --> 14:31.358
If I can get you to sign here.

14:32.949 --> 14:34.877
- Thank you very much. Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

14:34.878 --> 14:35.860
Have a great day, now.

14:35.861 --> 14:38.632
You, too. Ma'am.

14:54.516 --> 14:56.215
My dearest love,

14:56.216 --> 14:57.767
By the time you read this,

14:57.768 --> 14:59.335
I will have gone.

14:59.336 --> 15:02.171
Our life together has
brought me more joy

15:02.172 --> 15:06.100
Than a man like me thought
he could ever know.

15:09.246 --> 15:12.215
My first wish would be
to take you with me,

15:12.216 --> 15:14.784
But since you are in our
home readying yourself

15:14.785 --> 15:17.420
With the next chapter
of our life--

15:17.421 --> 15:20.623
To care for and raise
our beautiful child,

15:20.624 --> 15:25.428
My last hope is that you
finish what we started.

15:39.243 --> 15:41.135
Please...

15:42.049 --> 15:47.072
Please... Just let me go home.

15:47.073 --> 15:49.964
This is your fault.

15:50.587 --> 15:53.212
This is your fault.

15:53.757 --> 15:56.774
Please...

16:20.876 --> 16:22.463
What's she doing down there?

16:22.464 --> 16:25.137
She's trying to keep the media
from running the story right now.

16:25.138 --> 16:26.960
But wouldn't that help
us get it out there,

16:26.961 --> 16:28.866
Put some pressure on the partner?

16:28.867 --> 16:30.385
But if the partner didn't
know about the suicide,

16:30.386 --> 16:32.854
He might dispose of miss
Daniels and disappear.

16:32.855 --> 16:35.523
If anyone can stop the media
from running something, it's JJ.

16:35.524 --> 16:36.791
So let's profile the partner.

16:36.792 --> 16:40.435
We know that the unsub was
a dominant personality,

16:40.436 --> 16:43.229
An Alpha. Can any of you
guys think of a case

16:43.230 --> 16:45.851
Where a dominant unsub
committed suicide

16:45.852 --> 16:48.644
To protect a
submissive partner? No.

16:48.645 --> 16:50.805
So the partner must be
an equal in some way,

16:50.806 --> 16:52.536
Or at least not a competitor,

16:52.537 --> 16:54.648
Not somebody that he needed
to feel dominance over.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.334
Maybe it was someone
he cared about?

16:56.335 --> 16:59.192
It would be hard for a sadistic
psychopath to care about anybody.

16:59.193 --> 17:01.327
Which would make the partner all
that much more important to him.

17:01.328 --> 17:02.996
What about the tattoo artist?

17:02.997 --> 17:04.431
He couldn't have done
those by himself.

17:04.432 --> 17:05.598
Maybe that's the
role for the partner.

17:05.598 --> 17:06.833
It would certainly
make him important.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.968
What the hell does any of
this have to do with Becky?

17:08.969 --> 17:11.565
I mean, isn't there something
we should be doing, damn it?

17:11.566 --> 17:14.586
Detective, may I speak
with you for a moment?

17:18.545 --> 17:21.614
So we have until the
evening news--6 P.M.

17:21.615 --> 17:22.914
How much do they know?

17:22.915 --> 17:25.453
Oh, the troopers
told them everything.

17:26.036 --> 17:27.662
Agent Rossi,
please tell me you called

17:27.663 --> 17:29.371
Because the case is over

17:29.372 --> 17:30.788
And I can erase
this freakity-freak

17:30.789 --> 17:32.741
Off my otherwise
uber-delicious desktops.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.110
Long way to go, kid.

17:34.111 --> 17:37.313
I am into epidermartistry
as much as the next gen xer,

17:37.314 --> 17:40.216
But this guy...Eesh, I'm just glad

17:40.217 --> 17:42.549
He's not breathing the same air as you,
my fine furry friends.

17:42.550 --> 17:45.921
Agreed. What have you found out
about tattoo artists down here?

17:45.922 --> 17:47.189
That the state of Florida

17:47.190 --> 17:49.319
Requires licensing for
all skin illustrators,

17:49.320 --> 17:52.027
But--and I am not going to
elaborate on how I know this--

17:52.028 --> 17:55.931
Not everyone in the body art lifestyle
goes through official channels.

17:55.932 --> 17:57.366
All right, we'll start
with the legit ones

17:57.367 --> 17:59.844
And see if anyone
recognizes the work.

18:00.281 --> 18:01.837
I shall send the list to your PDA.

18:01.838 --> 18:03.139
Thanks.

18:04.739 --> 18:07.077
Epidermartistry?

18:14.417 --> 18:16.152
...What is happening.
She will get...

18:16.153 --> 18:18.921
Only a girl can fill
that empty energy.

18:18.922 --> 18:19.955
Starting to get angry.

18:19.956 --> 18:22.725
I approach her door...

18:24.797 --> 18:26.028
Look, I'm sorry I popped off.

18:26.029 --> 18:27.530
I'm just a little worked up.

18:27.531 --> 18:30.199
I've been over the Rebecca
Daniels case file, your reports.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.569
Do you know her?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.281
What?

18:33.282 --> 18:35.768
Is there a personal relationship?

18:36.236 --> 18:38.073
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

18:38.074 --> 18:40.910
You've referred to
her twice as Becky.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.977
I did?

18:41.978 --> 18:43.579
And nowhere else is she
referred to that way.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.047
It's always Rebecca.

18:45.048 --> 18:46.582
Now, if there's something that's
gonna cloud your judgment,

18:46.583 --> 18:48.776
I need to know about it.

18:49.619 --> 18:52.555
No. I don't know her.

18:53.581 --> 18:55.724
Then what is it?

18:55.725 --> 18:57.811
Look, I've...

18:57.812 --> 19:00.447
I've been doing this
a long time, and...

19:00.448 --> 19:02.683
It usually just washes
right over me, you know,

19:02.684 --> 19:07.173
People killing people,
depravity, you know?

19:07.174 --> 19:09.541
As long as you make it
home at night, right?

19:11.026 --> 19:13.327
But this one...

19:13.701 --> 19:16.730
Her parents...

19:16.731 --> 19:19.900
They're just such good,
decent people.

19:19.901 --> 19:23.427
She seems like an
amazing girl, and...

19:23.672 --> 19:25.580
It's all...

19:27.809 --> 19:31.145
Sometimes it's just too much.

19:31.146 --> 19:33.714
You take it personal.

19:35.350 --> 19:38.152
Stupid, right?

19:39.497 --> 19:43.133
Caring about a victim,
personalizing them,

19:43.134 --> 19:45.969
Can only be stupid
if it's reckless.

19:47.571 --> 19:50.407
Don't worry about me.

19:50.408 --> 19:52.133
I'm good.

19:52.134 --> 19:54.946
All right. Let's go and
try to bring her home.

19:58.449 --> 20:00.650
It's like 110 out here

20:00.651 --> 20:02.686
And it feels like a refrigerator

20:02.687 --> 20:04.754
Compared to their warehouse.

20:04.755 --> 20:06.389
How's Reid doing?

20:06.390 --> 20:07.905
It doesn't even seem to faze him.

20:07.906 --> 20:10.172
He's just sitting there
in a corner turning pages.

20:10.173 --> 20:12.228
Yeah, he goes to another
place when he reads.

20:12.229 --> 20:14.898
I've got the addresses of
the major tattoo parlors

20:14.899 --> 20:16.166
In Tallahassee.

20:16.167 --> 20:17.834
That work is pretty detailed.

20:17.835 --> 20:19.687
Someone might recognize it.

20:19.688 --> 20:21.509
You want to go check
these out with me?

20:21.510 --> 20:23.645
Sounds fun.

20:25.929 --> 20:29.032
Hey, so, uh, I got a few
more hours out of the media.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.100
Well, we'll take what we can get.

20:31.101 --> 20:34.170
Prentiss and Rossi are going to
check out some tattoo parlors.

20:34.171 --> 20:36.064
Is he OK?

20:36.674 --> 20:37.840
Yeah.

20:37.841 --> 20:40.376
Did you ask him about
calling her Becky?

20:40.377 --> 20:42.131
He'll be all right.

20:42.132 --> 20:43.646
Well, I hope so.

20:43.647 --> 20:44.769
Because we still
have no indication

20:44.770 --> 20:47.264
That this girl's even alive.

20:51.338 --> 20:54.229
I wasn't able To tie
up all the loose ends.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.632
You would have known
what was happening.

20:56.633 --> 20:59.441
So now it's left for you.

20:59.916 --> 21:03.588
Wait for night and
take it to the water.

21:03.589 --> 21:06.057
The animals will do the rest.

21:11.058 --> 21:13.526
This guy killed all those women?

21:13.527 --> 21:14.861
Looks like it.

21:14.862 --> 21:17.550
And there's another one missing.

21:17.648 --> 21:19.949
Then he killed himself?

21:19.950 --> 21:20.950
Yeah, he did.

21:20.951 --> 21:23.096
Good. Sort of a public service.

21:23.097 --> 21:26.188
Hmm. I guess that's a
good way of looking at it.

21:26.189 --> 21:28.657
We send it to the m.E.
's office in Tallahassee.

21:28.658 --> 21:29.736
You sign it?

21:29.737 --> 21:31.445
I'll take care of that,
later. Thanks.

21:31.446 --> 21:32.812
Thanks a lot.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.250
You sure it's OK to move the body?

21:37.251 --> 21:39.285
Well, there's no
reason not to anymore.

21:39.286 --> 21:40.887
We've seen this guy's show.

21:40.888 --> 21:43.423
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

21:43.424 --> 21:44.791
Like what?

21:44.792 --> 21:48.061
Everything. The, uh, suicide,

21:48.062 --> 21:50.797
The clippings, the journal.

21:51.966 --> 21:53.044
I think it's pretty safe to say

21:53.045 --> 21:56.554
That no one's ever seen
anything like this.

22:02.309 --> 22:04.581
Man, this is beautiful work.

22:04.582 --> 22:06.116
It's a body suit?

22:06.117 --> 22:07.568
He's completely covered?

22:07.569 --> 22:08.895
Pretty much.

22:08.896 --> 22:11.054
Yeah. "the illustrated man."

22:11.055 --> 22:12.456
Second time I've heard that today.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.591
The book? Reid mentioned it.

22:14.592 --> 22:17.094
Everybody in the body art
world knows that story.

22:17.095 --> 22:19.062
You said this dude killed himself?

22:19.063 --> 22:22.436
Did he, like, gash his
wrists open or something?

22:22.437 --> 22:26.303
The tattoos--could you
recognize who did this?

22:26.304 --> 22:29.106
I wish. I'd hire this
dude in a heartbeat.

22:29.107 --> 22:30.607
This looks free-hand.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.810
Trust me, free-hand
portraiture is pretty gnarly

22:32.811 --> 22:34.719
To do on skin, man.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.377
Did he shoot himself?

22:36.378 --> 22:38.145
Because none of these
pictures have a head.

22:38.146 --> 22:42.250
Can you tell if the
same artist did these?

22:42.251 --> 22:43.751
It looks like it.

22:43.752 --> 22:45.460
But they weren't all
done at the same time.

22:45.461 --> 22:47.221
Some of the inks are newer.

22:47.222 --> 22:49.693
You know, if I saw the body,
I'd probably be able to tell you more.

22:49.694 --> 22:53.227
Uh-huh. How about these?

22:53.562 --> 22:56.425
These are a lot of portraits.
What do they mean?

22:56.426 --> 22:58.766
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

23:00.435 --> 23:01.969
Wait.

23:02.157 --> 23:03.971
That doesn't fit.

23:03.972 --> 23:05.072
What doesn't?

23:05.073 --> 23:07.454
There's something
under the rose there.

23:07.455 --> 23:09.991
Looks like...A cross?

23:09.992 --> 23:10.992
A big one.

23:10.993 --> 23:11.993
Where?

23:11.994 --> 23:13.161
Inside the rose.

23:13.162 --> 23:15.297
And the work is sloppy.

23:15.298 --> 23:17.733
See that? They put the rose
over it to cover it up.

23:17.734 --> 23:19.034
Yeah, I see that.

23:19.035 --> 23:21.036
Yeah, that wasn't
done professionally.

23:21.037 --> 23:22.738
More like it was done in jail.

23:22.739 --> 23:23.972
If he did time,

23:23.973 --> 23:25.938
That would explain how
a 50-year-old unsub

23:25.939 --> 23:27.646
Doesn't start killing
until he's 40.

23:27.647 --> 23:28.591
This dude's a killer?

23:28.592 --> 23:30.979
And why rapists become killers
after they've been in prison.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.703
They learn not to leave a witness.

23:32.704 --> 23:36.017
Garcia can track this through the
biometric recognition program.

23:36.018 --> 23:40.722
So, there's, like, no chance of
me seeing the dead dude, right?

23:40.723 --> 23:41.890
None.

23:41.891 --> 23:44.693
Hey, p.G., I'm gonna send you
a photograph Of a tattoo.

23:45.197 --> 23:46.981
You know, that empty space

23:46.982 --> 23:49.831
On his back makes him exactly like "
the illustrated man."

23:49.832 --> 23:51.566
I thought he was
covered completely.

23:51.567 --> 23:52.768
In the book.

23:52.769 --> 23:55.274
In the movie, there's an
open spot On his back,

23:55.275 --> 23:57.939
so you can see the future.

24:03.630 --> 24:05.426
Rossi and Prentiss think
he may have done time

24:05.427 --> 24:07.294
And that one of the tattoos
may have been done in prison.

24:07.295 --> 24:08.171
That's a good bet.

24:08.172 --> 24:10.398
I've got Garcia running everything
Through the biometrics database.

24:10.399 --> 24:11.359
Biometrics?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.801
Yeah, it catalogues all the
prison inmates and their tattoos.

24:13.802 --> 24:16.003
They have detailed photos of
every one on every inmate.

24:25.347 --> 24:27.114
What happened?

24:27.115 --> 24:29.217
Shut up.

24:29.766 --> 24:31.466
Please, sit down.

24:31.467 --> 24:33.435
You can tell me.

24:33.436 --> 24:35.403
We can sit down and--

24:35.404 --> 24:39.441
We can talk about this. We could--

24:39.442 --> 24:41.643
Wait! Please...

24:41.644 --> 24:44.646
Can we please talk?

24:44.647 --> 24:48.650
My dad has to be so
worried about me.

24:48.651 --> 24:51.352
Don't you have a father?

24:51.353 --> 24:53.788
I don't have anyone anymore.

24:53.789 --> 24:57.459
Please...Just let me go

24:57.460 --> 25:00.495
Before he comes back.

25:00.496 --> 25:02.564
He's not coming back.

25:04.533 --> 25:06.201
What?

25:07.036 --> 25:09.304
Wait.

25:09.305 --> 25:12.574
You can let me go.

25:12.575 --> 25:14.776
What?

25:14.777 --> 25:15.910
It's just--

25:15.911 --> 25:18.346
I won't tell anyone what happened.

25:18.347 --> 25:20.609
I promise I won't tell anyone.

25:20.610 --> 25:23.685
You won't tell anyone?

25:25.087 --> 25:26.855
I--

25:29.792 --> 25:32.627
I know you're afraid of him, too.

25:35.531 --> 25:37.611
You're not going to tell anyone

25:37.612 --> 25:40.883
Because you're never
leaving this room alive.

25:40.884 --> 25:42.971
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

25:42.972 --> 25:45.884
I'm so sorry...

25:45.885 --> 25:47.575
I was never afraid of him.

25:47.576 --> 25:48.943
I loved him.

25:48.944 --> 25:54.783
I would do anything,
I did anything for him.

25:54.784 --> 25:57.218
He was my masterpiece.

25:59.789 --> 26:02.490
I...

26:04.727 --> 26:06.861
Oh, no.

26:06.862 --> 26:08.630
You're bleeding!

26:20.412 --> 26:24.368
I'll be able to fill in the
last space in my art collection.

26:24.369 --> 26:27.354
The last space... Last space...
Last space...

26:27.355 --> 26:28.496
No, no, no, that's not right.

26:28.497 --> 26:30.497
Hey, guys, it isn't
the only blank space.

26:30.498 --> 26:31.798
What do you mean?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.191
The spot on his chest
where we assumed

26:33.192 --> 26:34.446
Yeah? Rebecca's
portrait would go--

26:34.447 --> 26:36.703
In the journal he talks about
filling in the last space,

26:36.704 --> 26:38.638
How once he does that the
artwork will be complete.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.940
And? It isn't the
only blank space.

26:39.941 --> 26:41.363
In his back,
in the middle of that tree

26:41.364 --> 26:44.367
Is a giant open spot. Why would he
talk about completing the artwork

26:44.368 --> 26:46.280
When he hasn't?

26:46.281 --> 26:47.848
I need to see the body again.

26:47.849 --> 26:48.580
I'll go with you.

26:48.581 --> 26:51.538
I'll call the M.E. and let him
know You're on your way. - Garcia?

26:51.539 --> 26:53.869
I ran the covered tattoo through
the morpho tracking system.

26:53.870 --> 26:55.770
Tell me you got something, babe.

26:55.771 --> 26:57.138
Emily, don't get ahead
of my dramatic telling.

26:57.139 --> 26:59.674
I analyzed color,
design, and texture.

26:59.675 --> 27:03.439
There's a 95% chance it is from
one of 4 major institutions

27:03.440 --> 27:05.013
In the northeastern prison system.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.550
The string of missings
began unbroken from 2000,

27:08.551 --> 27:10.118
So I went back from that year,

27:10.119 --> 27:13.822
Found 53 similar
tattoos on forearms.

27:13.823 --> 27:15.624
Of those 53, 10 were released

27:15.625 --> 27:17.826
Prior to 2000.
Thank you and good night.

27:17.827 --> 27:19.027
You are amazing.

27:19.028 --> 27:22.497
Of the 10, any convicted rapists?

27:22.498 --> 27:23.465
4.

27:23.466 --> 27:27.636
Do any of them trace
back To Tallahassee?

27:27.637 --> 27:29.137
None.

27:29.138 --> 27:31.106
So ultimately I have Nada.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.707
Bob.

27:32.708 --> 27:36.144
Oh, the guy, his name,
the guy who rented the property,

27:36.145 --> 27:37.579
Just Bob.

27:37.580 --> 27:38.613
Ok, OK.

27:38.614 --> 27:40.615
I have a Robert Matthew Burke,

27:40.616 --> 27:42.250
Convicted in 1991,
8 years for rape,

27:42.251 --> 27:44.052
Released October of '99.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.655
And the missings began in 2000.

27:46.656 --> 27:49.724
Garcia, remind me never
to try to hide from you.

27:49.725 --> 27:52.093
[chuckles] perish the
thought, Mon Ami.

27:53.275 --> 27:55.130
Hotch, we got the name.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.465
The unsub's name is
Robert Matthew Burke.

27:57.466 --> 27:58.466
Burke?

27:58.467 --> 27:59.467
You know him?

27:59.468 --> 28:01.369
Burke. Yeah.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.338
I know the name.

28:03.339 --> 28:04.339
Damn it!

28:04.340 --> 28:06.141
He's a registered sex offender.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.378
He's an ex-con out of Virginia.

28:07.379 --> 28:10.276
He got a traffic ticket near FSU
the night Rebecca disappeared.

28:10.277 --> 28:11.544
He's one of my suspects.

28:11.545 --> 28:14.608
I--I went to his apartment,
I don't know, a couple times

28:14.609 --> 28:16.443
In the past 3 weeks to
try to interview him,

28:16.444 --> 28:17.826
But I could never
catch up with him.

28:17.827 --> 28:19.279
Did he know you were
looking for him?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.014
Well, yeah, I talked
to him on the phone.

28:21.015 --> 28:24.084
He's scheduled to come down for an
interview and a DNA swab on Monday.

28:24.085 --> 28:25.267
That's what changed.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.094
He knew it was only a matter of
time before you caught up to him.

28:27.095 --> 28:28.956
And he wasn't about
to go back to prison.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.824
Yeah. Do you have his address?

28:31.893 --> 28:34.661
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

28:34.662 --> 28:37.664
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

28:38.994 --> 28:40.867
Unchain me.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.442
Unchain me and I will help you.

28:48.443 --> 28:51.378
I am not stupid.

28:51.934 --> 28:54.848
Your baby needs help.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.398
Wait! You can't--

29:11.399 --> 29:12.733
The collar.

29:12.734 --> 29:16.403
You help me and I'll let you go.

29:16.404 --> 29:17.404
Ok.

29:19.107 --> 29:20.874
Ok. Ok.

29:28.783 --> 29:30.684
FBI!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.291
Damn it.

29:41.229 --> 29:42.967
If these tattoos are a fetish,

29:42.968 --> 29:45.236
What enjoyment does he get
out of the ones on his back?

29:45.237 --> 29:46.871
He can't even see them.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.706
You know what?
There's something here.

29:48.707 --> 29:51.543
I can feel the raised ink.

29:51.544 --> 29:54.012
Do you have a black light scanner?

29:54.013 --> 29:55.346
Thanks.

29:56.916 --> 29:59.384
Right there. Feel that.

29:59.385 --> 30:01.152
Yeah, what is that?

30:01.153 --> 30:03.188
Thanks.

30:04.456 --> 30:07.325
I've read about this.
Tattoos put on with invisible ink

30:07.326 --> 30:09.928
So that no one can see them.

30:09.929 --> 30:11.196
Oh, man.

30:12.898 --> 30:17.068
Can you, uh, turn the
lights down? Thanks.

30:19.572 --> 30:22.707
Look, there's one over here, too.

30:22.708 --> 30:25.143
They're all connected
to the faces.

30:25.144 --> 30:27.612
They lead to the blank spot.

30:27.613 --> 30:29.247
Ow, wow. What is that?

30:29.248 --> 30:32.650
It's an embryo in a womb.

30:34.266 --> 30:37.555
The partner's a woman,
and they're having a baby.

30:37.556 --> 30:39.691
Oh, my God!

30:41.193 --> 30:44.062
There's more blood.
I don't know what I'm doing.

30:44.063 --> 30:47.265
It...It won't stop.

30:47.266 --> 30:48.666
It won't stop.
I don't know what to do!

30:48.667 --> 30:51.102
It won't stop. I don't--

30:51.103 --> 30:53.404
Help me.

30:53.405 --> 30:54.839
Do we know if she
had the baby yet?

30:54.840 --> 30:56.975
The tattoos have dates,
the embryo doesn't.

30:56.976 --> 30:59.310
Dating is prominent in the
tattoos and the journals

30:59.311 --> 31:00.481
And they're calendrical
in their abductions.

31:00.482 --> 31:02.046
It's hard to believe
their baby's birthdate

31:02.047 --> 31:03.381
Wouldn't be exceedingly
important to them.

31:03.382 --> 31:05.316
Then she's probably
still pregnant.

31:05.317 --> 31:07.051
Well, he didn't live here
with a pregnant woman.

31:07.052 --> 31:08.419
This is a males-only SRO.

31:08.420 --> 31:09.988
No, she has to have
a house, anyway.

31:09.989 --> 31:11.122
How do you know that?

31:11.123 --> 31:12.657
They kept these women
for a year each.

31:12.658 --> 31:14.259
It wasn't in a one-room apartment.

31:14.260 --> 31:17.428
Everyone get back here. We need to
update the profile and narrow the search.

31:17.429 --> 31:19.597
[grunting] push. Push.

31:19.598 --> 31:21.532
Push! Push!

31:21.533 --> 31:22.800
It's almost--

31:22.801 --> 31:24.168
It's almost there.
Just keep pushing.

31:24.169 --> 31:26.104
I see the head! I can't.

31:26.105 --> 31:27.739
One more time, that's it!

31:34.313 --> 31:36.547
Hi.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.355
Please...

31:44.356 --> 31:46.791
Tell me it's a girl.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.826
What?

31:48.827 --> 31:50.528
It can't be a boy.

31:50.529 --> 31:51.277
Please.

31:54.533 --> 31:56.434
It--

32:01.206 --> 32:04.242
You have a son.

32:06.712 --> 32:09.047
It can't be a boy.

32:12.694 --> 32:14.085
It can't be a boy.

32:14.086 --> 32:15.285
Get it away from me.

32:15.286 --> 32:17.441
You need to take him.
I don't want it.

32:17.442 --> 32:21.562
He'll hurt me like they all do.

32:22.394 --> 32:27.165
I felt for sure I
was having a girl.

32:27.166 --> 32:29.033
No, no, no!

32:29.886 --> 32:33.905
You gotta get me out of here.

32:34.061 --> 32:38.676
You have to get me out of here!

32:40.079 --> 32:42.355
Help us!

32:42.673 --> 32:45.103
Help us!

32:47.285 --> 32:49.820
I know.

32:52.052 --> 32:55.814
You're a sweetheart.

32:57.711 --> 32:59.732
[sobs] it's OK.

32:59.733 --> 33:01.534
The partner being
pregnant can help us.

33:01.535 --> 33:02.527
We should have Garcia
try and find her

33:02.528 --> 33:04.025
Through doctor visits
or medical records.

33:04.026 --> 33:05.884
He basically lived off the grid,

33:05.885 --> 33:07.352
Which means she did, too.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.088
Judging by the photographs of
what they did to the victims,

33:10.089 --> 33:12.223
It's safe to say they
live in isolation.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.560
We've seen his hatred for women,
and yet he teams up with her.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.729
What kind of woman
could change him?

33:17.730 --> 33:19.698
You think they met in prison?

33:19.699 --> 33:21.266
Garcia already went
through all of that.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.600
He had no female visitors.

33:22.601 --> 33:26.271
What about prison staff,
doctors, religious volunteers?

33:26.272 --> 33:28.740
We went through a long
list of all the vendors

33:28.741 --> 33:30.308
Who were there during
his incarceration.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.410
None of them resurfaced
in Tallahassee.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.821
What kind of a woman
would go to a prison

33:33.822 --> 33:35.621
To fall in love with a rapist?

33:35.622 --> 33:39.384
Someone vulnerable, emotionally fragile,
drawn to violent men.

33:39.385 --> 33:42.754
Someone in her life made her that way.
Classic abuse cycle.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.122
What if that's who she
was there to visit?

33:44.123 --> 33:45.557
It's worth a try.

33:45.994 --> 33:46.791
[beep] my sweet.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.592
Hey, you know the visitor logs
From the prison we looked at?

33:49.593 --> 33:51.294
Uh-huh. Still have
them at the ready.

33:51.295 --> 33:53.162
Ok, great. I need you
to check dates for me.

33:53.163 --> 33:57.266
Were there any women who visited
another inmate while Burke was there

33:57.267 --> 33:59.869
But then suddenly stopped
visiting when Burke was released?

33:59.870 --> 34:03.139
Huh. Ok, let me hit you back.

34:03.618 --> 34:07.416
It's OK. It's OK.

34:07.417 --> 34:09.906
I can't help you!

34:21.591 --> 34:24.550
[baby crying] it's OK...

34:27.081 --> 34:28.070
Rev your engines, guys.

34:28.071 --> 34:30.266
Juliet Monroe went to
visit her father in prison

34:30.268 --> 34:33.058
Once or twice a year
from '92 to '95.

34:33.059 --> 34:34.246
What was he in for?

34:34.248 --> 34:36.597
Rape. And she was
his primary victim.

34:36.598 --> 34:38.846
He raped her and she still
went to visit him every year?

34:38.847 --> 34:40.931
She's repeating the
cycle she grew up with.

34:40.931 --> 34:43.268
Yeah. And she went from visiting
him once or twice a year

34:43.270 --> 34:45.928
To once a month from '95 to '97.

34:45.929 --> 34:48.321
When Burke was serving
his time for rape.

34:48.322 --> 34:50.408
Yeah. And then she increased
her visits to once a week

34:50.409 --> 34:53.507
All through '98 and '99,
until they stopped completely

34:53.509 --> 34:54.978
In October of that year.

34:54.978 --> 34:55.989
That's when he was released.

34:55.991 --> 34:57.735
And if you want me to
slip you some convincers,

34:57.736 --> 34:59.393
She owns a house in
Northern Florida.

34:59.394 --> 35:01.591
Garcia, get us the address.

35:15.349 --> 35:17.884
Rossi and I will take the front.
Take the side.

35:21.422 --> 35:22.956
Go.

35:30.131 --> 35:31.331
In here!

35:31.332 --> 35:32.832
Please help. In here!

35:33.906 --> 35:35.397
In here.

35:35.398 --> 35:38.405
The baby. The baby.

35:38.406 --> 35:40.440
She's--she's--she's--

35:40.441 --> 35:42.375
She's dead.

35:43.577 --> 35:45.445
All right, give me the baby.

35:45.446 --> 35:46.813
Give me the baby. I got him.

35:46.814 --> 35:49.209
You're gonna be all right.

35:50.334 --> 35:52.036
Help me.

35:54.338 --> 35:56.706
Becky, are you OK?

35:58.142 --> 36:01.951
I just want to go home.

36:02.073 --> 36:05.295
I just want to go home.

36:05.296 --> 36:07.866
Yeah, you're going home, honey.

36:07.867 --> 36:10.289
You're going home. It's OK.

36:13.409 --> 36:14.887
So, I talked to your parents.

36:14.888 --> 36:17.664
They're gonna meet you
at the hospital, OK?

36:20.630 --> 36:22.216
Is the baby OK?

36:22.217 --> 36:25.184
Oh, yeah, he's-
he's in another ambulance.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.752
What's gonna happen to him?

36:26.753 --> 36:31.573
Hey, don't you worry. We're gonna
take real good care of him, OK?

36:32.321 --> 36:34.796
Ma'am, we should get going.

36:34.866 --> 36:37.665
Ok. Take care.

36:38.421 --> 36:41.170
It'll be OK.

36:47.234 --> 36:49.535
She gonna be OK?

36:50.277 --> 36:53.312
I wouldn't bet against anybody
who survived what she did.

36:53.313 --> 36:55.314
How about you?

36:55.315 --> 36:58.274
Oh, yeah, you know,
nothing's gonna affect me.

36:58.275 --> 37:02.555
You know, we wouldn't be here if you
hadn't worked the case as hard as you did.

37:02.556 --> 37:04.324
How's that?

37:04.325 --> 37:06.657
It would have been an easy thing
To miss a routine traffic ticket

37:06.658 --> 37:08.828
In the area she disappeared.

37:08.829 --> 37:11.181
You kept the pressure on.

37:11.182 --> 37:14.867
You cleared 9 homicides and
you brought Becky home.

37:14.868 --> 37:17.803
It's impressive work, Detective.

37:20.544 --> 37:22.513
Thanks.

37:40.527 --> 37:42.210
3 cards, please.

37:42.211 --> 37:45.464
3 cards for the lady.

37:45.465 --> 37:47.967
And I'm gonna take one card.

37:47.968 --> 37:50.142
Ooh. One card.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.178
A straight or a flush, Dr.
Reid, what are you trying to fill in?

37:53.179 --> 37:55.673
Well, considering the odds of
filling in an open-ended straight

37:55.674 --> 37:59.185
with one card Are 5-to-1 against,
while a one-card flush draw

37:59.186 --> 38:03.453
Is more like 4.5-to-1,
I guess you'd say if I was smart,

38:03.454 --> 38:06.419
I'm drawing to a flush.

38:07.454 --> 38:10.289
I think I'm gonna
go all in on this.

38:18.276 --> 38:20.607
So, are you?

38:20.608 --> 38:23.390
Am I drawing to a flush,
or am I smart?

38:23.391 --> 38:26.360
Either. Well,
I'm-- I'm provably a genius,

38:26.361 --> 38:30.708
But, uh, actually,
I was drawing to a full house.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.572
8s over 6s.

38:33.493 --> 38:35.193
I always forget you're from Vegas.

38:35.194 --> 38:36.194
Yup.

38:36.195 --> 38:37.529
Ooh, I'm sorry, not so fast.

38:37.530 --> 38:39.765
I, too, have a boat.

38:39.766 --> 38:42.134
Jacks over 3s.

38:42.135 --> 38:43.602
You drew 3 cards to a full house?

38:43.603 --> 38:45.504
That's like 100-to-1 against.

38:45.505 --> 38:47.139
97-to-1.

38:47.140 --> 38:50.375
Looks like you're out.

38:50.376 --> 38:52.377
Hey, Prentiss.

38:52.378 --> 38:53.812
Sin to win.

38:54.601 --> 38:55.774
I'm sorry, what?

38:55.775 --> 38:57.493
Come on, now, I gotta know.

38:57.494 --> 39:01.153
What the hell is a sin to win
weekend in Atlantic city?

39:03.929 --> 39:07.300
Derek, I have a tremendous
amount of respect for you,

39:07.301 --> 39:11.553
But there's some questions
that if you have to ask them,

39:11.554 --> 39:15.273
It means you probably
couldn't handle the answer.

39:19.072 --> 39:20.945
There is a whole other
side to that woman.

39:20.946 --> 39:22.201
I never lose.

39:22.202 --> 39:24.377
A whole other side.

39:25.351 --> 39:29.087
I know environment plays a
bigger role than genetics

39:29.088 --> 39:30.955
When it comes to determining
a child's future,

39:30.956 --> 39:33.829
But that baby, I mean,
both the parents.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.994
How many other serial
killers had kids?

39:35.995 --> 39:38.541
A lot. Manson has like
10 or 11 children.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.065
Albert fish had 6.

39:40.066 --> 39:41.833
Gary Ridgeway had a son.

39:41.834 --> 39:45.581
Fred and Rosemary West Had 7
children living in the home

39:45.582 --> 39:47.002
Where they killed 10 women.

39:47.003 --> 39:48.179
Including one of the children.

39:48.180 --> 39:51.109
Ok, so, the baby's gonna be OK?

39:51.110 --> 39:54.546
Most likely. If he grows
up in a good home.

39:55.329 --> 39:58.450
Loved, cared for.

39:59.285 --> 40:01.653
Good.

40:04.323 --> 40:05.724
Gandhi said,

40:05.725 --> 40:08.626
"I have seen children
successfully surmount the effects

40:08.627 --> 40:10.095
"of an evil inheritance.

40:10.096 --> 40:12.964
"that is due to purity
being an inherent attribute

40:12.965 --> 40:14.432
Of the soul."
