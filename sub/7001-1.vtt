Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:57.679 --> 00:59.350
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:59.439 --> 01:02.390
Hey, guys. My show is on.
Come on and watch.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.188
No, thanks.
We're playing.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.069
- Oh… Jill.
- Yeah.

01:06.159 --> 01:08.829
I got a spot all warmed up on the couch.
Too/ Time 's ready to begin. Come on.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.189
- Couldn't get the boys to watch, huh?
- They were a little busy.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.739
- So am I.
- Well, your loss.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.829
It's a great episode. Classic.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.390
I'm showing everybody
how to install a deadbolt lock. Yeah.

01:20.879 --> 01:22.189
…so let's get that taken care of.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.870
There you go. Hear that snap?

01:23.959 --> 01:28.069
That means it's on. Tool tip,
tool belt fashion tip from ol' Tim:

01:28.159 --> 01:31.469
Hike it up so you avoid that unsightly
butt crack, cos who wants to see that?

01:32.680 --> 01:34.060
Boy, there's nothing
like the feeling

01:34.100 --> 01:37.989
of rawhide and cold steel
hanging on your hips.

01:38.079 --> 01:43.000
My wife says when I put this bad boy on,
I turn into a wild, hairy, disgusting ape.

01:44.879 --> 01:46.870
You know what? I don't think
women understand the feeling

01:46.959 --> 01:50.150
of rawhide and steel,
vice-gripping, monkey-plier,

01:50.239 --> 01:54.349
dado head, cut-flat, jig minor,
jig box, hot goo…

01:55.680 --> 01:57.150
Busy day, today.

01:57.239 --> 01:59.799
Al and I are gonna rough-in that house.
finish hanging that garage door.

01:59.879 --> 02:00.859
But first, we're gonna install

02:00.959 --> 02:03.030
a min-cylinder deadbolt
security lock in this door.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.709
- Morning. Al.
- Morning. Tim.

02:04.799 --> 02:08.469
Always follow your instructions.
Always makes jobs a bit easier.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.508
We've already laid out
with the template included in the kit

02:10.598 --> 02:13.349
where we're putting our holes.
Used my awl here to set my drill.

02:13.439 --> 02:15.819
All right, Al,
let's have the drill, please.

02:16.159 --> 02:19.509
Look at that butt crack
you got going there.

02:19.599 --> 02:23.949
I think we ought to start today
by spackling Al's butt crack shut, huh?

02:24.039 --> 02:26.189
With the new Patch-and-Paint
butt-crack filler putty.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.189
Hey. I smell voltage.
I think it's time to drill.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.349
Right. Tim. And we'll be using
the one-and-a-half-inch auger bit.

02:36.439 --> 02:40.629
Come on, Al. That's a girl drill.
We need a man drill, don't we?

02:40.719 --> 02:43.180
But Tim, this is the proper tool.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.069
Yeah. I bet it is, Al. You know, men,
when we want a job done right

02:46.159 --> 02:48.030
and we want it done quick,
what do we need?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.789
More power.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.750
Darn right, more power.
Thank you, Lisa.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.469
Now, there is raw power.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.349
This is the Binford series
heavy-duty, variable-speed drill.

03:00.439 --> 03:05.590
double reduction spur gearing,
1400 RPM, 6.8 amps.

03:08.879 --> 03:12.419
But you won't even be halfway
through your aug before you hear this.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.629
Honey, shut that thing off.
It's making too much noise.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.830
Always ignore that first plea.
Just makes her yell a little louder.

03:20.919 --> 03:23.300
Here she comes down the hall.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.509
Shut that thing off. Do you have mud
in your ears, you big baboon?

03:27.599 --> 03:29.590
- Who's that supposed to be?
- Hey.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.469
- Is that supposed to be me?
- No, that's not you.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.710
Oh, what a relief.
Then who is it?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.590
It's every wife.

03:41.159 --> 03:44.939
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you know. I happen to be a wife.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.310
Every wife but you.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.229
Stop it. You'll make me go
to the bathroom.

03:50.319 --> 03:51.789
Let me up. Let me up.

03:51.879 --> 03:53.389
No, you started this.
You're staying right there.

03:53.479 --> 03:55.939
No.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.870
No, really. I have a blouse in the dryer.
I have to get that out. Let me go.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.270
Help.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.150
Tim, would you go see
who's killing who out there?

04:03.240 --> 04:06.069
I can only imagine. Randy, what are you
doing to your younger brother?

04:06.159 --> 04:08.389
I'm just hanging him
from the junglegym.

04:08.479 --> 04:10.629
- Help.
- Don't do that.

04:10.719 --> 04:11.860
He likes it.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.229
Randy, you let go of that rope

04:13.319 --> 04:15.430
or I'm gonna hot-glue your
little head to the garage door.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.709
- No running in the house.
- Brad!

04:19.800 --> 04:23.069
Cover the ball with both hands
so you don't fumble. Go on.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.069
Tim.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.750
And do as your mother says.
Don't run in the house.

04:27.839 --> 04:29.790
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

04:29.879 --> 04:32.910
"Sears Summer Spectacular Sale."

04:33.680 --> 04:35.949
You can't go.
I've got this job interview.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.819
- What job interview?
- I have been telling you this all week.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.269
It's the personnel manager
at Kingman-Harmell.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.829
You never told me about a job interview.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.589
Tim, do you ever listen to me?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.870
It was the last thing that I said
in bed to you last night.

04:47.959 --> 04:51.629
No. I believe, if you recall, the last thing
you said to me in bed last night was.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.180
"No."

04:59.800 --> 05:03.420
You're thinking of tonight.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.029
You split my sides.
You really do.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.069
Is that my liver?
Look in there. Look at that.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.990
You stop that.
I gotta be there in an hour

05:18.079 --> 05:19.870
and you gotta stay here with these kids.

05:19.959 --> 05:23.990
- Fine. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes? Who are you kidding?

05:24.079 --> 05:28.029
You'll be down there, drooling, fondling
all the tools, your eyes bugging out.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.189
You don't even look at me like that.

05:31.279 --> 05:34.870
I would if you were mo speeds
and reversible.

05:35.759 --> 05:39.149
- Tim.
- You won't even know I'm gone.

05:39.240 --> 05:43.629
Tim, walk out that door and this goes
in the trash compactor.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.069
That's my Binford power tape
with positive toggle lock.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.389
- Kiss it goodbye.
- Don't turn that on.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.100
- Are you staying?
- Yes. God, you're mean to me.

05:56.600 --> 06:01.189
Aw, there's food boogers all over it.

06:01.279 --> 06:04.750
Since you're staying.
would you load the dishwasher?

06:04.839 --> 06:07.550
Why not?
Now that you've broken my spirit.

06:07.639 --> 06:10.269
Tim, this job is important to me.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.589
Aren't you excited about me
going back to work?

06:12.680 --> 06:16.990
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.

06:17.079 --> 06:19.310
Could you maybe work up
a little enthusiasm?

06:19.399 --> 06:20.620
I'm sorry, honey.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.350
Gosh. I'm excited that you won't be
laying around the house

06:23.439 --> 06:25.029
mooching oﬀ the boys and me.

06:26.079 --> 06:29.149
Do the other side.
I'm your love slave.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.189
- Is it OK if I go over to Tommy's?
- What?

06:32.279 --> 06:35.189
- Is it OK if I go over to Tommy's?
- Yeah, sure.

06:35.279 --> 06:38.310
Honey, don't put that in the dishwasher.
You have to rinse it oﬀ first.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.230
I gotta wash the dish
before I put it in the dishwasher?

06:41.319 --> 06:44.509
Yeah. That spray's not
strong enough for egg yolk.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.990
It would be if we had a man's
dishwasher…

06:48.079 --> 06:50.379
but, no, you insisted on
the Lady Sott Touch decor series.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.860
- Little tiny buttons that no man can…
- I am so sorry.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.149
The grunting-hairy-ape model
was sold out.

06:55.639 --> 06:57.629
Just rinse the dish.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.069
You know, honey.
I could fix the spray on this dishwasher.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.870
- No. Tim. It's not broken.
- I know. It just needs more power.

07:09.199 --> 07:11.990
Every time you fix something
the fire department shows up.

07:12.079 --> 07:13.910
- This would be diﬀerent because I got…
- No.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.750
I am not gonna let you ruin
a perfectly good dishwasher

07:16.839 --> 07:18.589
just so you can get out
your tools and play.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.629
- Six horse…
- No.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.829
- One…
- No. No.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.430
Play? I host my own
home-improvement show.

07:26.519 --> 07:29.709
Don't touch the dishwasher.

07:32.879 --> 07:37.110
Don't touch the dishwasher.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.589
I'll show her.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.550
Boy. I'll strap that old 427 side arm
V-8 on that son-of-a-B.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.269
Dual quads, Headman headers,
V-Cam, 700 horse

07:48.360 --> 07:50.430
blowing everything off
every dish in there.

07:50.519 --> 07:53.350
including that
little sissy flower pattern.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.629
- l heard that.
- Hey.

07:57.319 --> 08:00.029
This is my house,
that is my dishwasher,

08:00.120 --> 08:01.910
and I will rewire it if I want to.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.230
No. You will not rewire it
and screw it up like you did the blender.

08:07.319 --> 08:08.790
End of discussion.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.790
What is your problem with the blender?

08:13.199 --> 08:17.230
It's the only blender on the block
that can purėe a brick.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.350
Tim. I'm going to that interview.
I'll see you in a couple hours.

08:23.439 --> 08:26.149
Good luck, honey.
And remember what Knute Rockne said:

08:26.240 --> 08:30.269
- "Hit 'em low and hit 'em hard."
- I'll do that.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.629
Oh, and remember, honey.
Don't touch the dishwasher.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.950
Honey. I'm not one of the kids.
You only have to tell me once.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.549
Yeah.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.549
- Hey. Wilson.
- Hi. Tim.

08:42.639 --> 08:45.590
I'm gonna rewire that dishwasher. Do
you still have that compressor for sale?

08:45.679 --> 08:50.110
No, no, no. Traded that for a set
of snow tires and an accordion.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.269
- Shoot.
- Dishwasher broken, huh?

08:53.360 --> 08:55.710
No. I'm just gonna show my wife
who's man of this house.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.429
I told her I was gonna rewire
that dishwasher, she jumps all over me.

09:00.519 --> 09:03.629
- Sometimes I don't know about her.
- This isn't about her.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.149
- It's not?
- No, no, no. This is about you.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.950
The reason you're
having problems with your wife

09:10.039 --> 09:12.909
is because you don't know
who you are as a man.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.990
I don't have a problem
in that area. Wilson.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.470
Not what I mean. Tim.
A lot of men feel lost, confused.

09:22.559 --> 09:26.100
You see. Tim, the industrial revolution
took the adult male out of the home.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.710
Boys were left without an older man
to teach them how to be men.

09:30.799 --> 09:33.500
We need to get back
to something more primitive.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.509
Atavistic.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.149
Atavistic.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.990
How do you spell that?

09:44.919 --> 09:47.110
- Let's just say "primitive".
- All right.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.470
Men need to spend more time
around the campfire with their elders.

09:50.559 --> 09:53.389
like in ancient days, seeking wisdom.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.669
telling stories, sharing…

09:55.759 --> 09:59.429
- Would these men all have to be naked?
- No, no.

09:59.519 --> 10:02.149
No, that's optional.

10:02.240 --> 10:06.590
You see, Tim, it's time for men
to reclaim the male spirit.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.990
I'm gonna start by reclaiming
that dishwasher.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.190
Mark, get your brothers.
We're out to Sears.

10:17.559 --> 10:19.940
All right. We gotta get this done
before your mom gets home, OK?

10:20.039 --> 10:22.990
Take a look at this bad boy.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.750
That's a Finley two-stage, five-horse
Blastmaster compressor.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.870
- All tubing inside is stainless steel…
- Dad, why are we doing this?

10:31.960 --> 10:36.429
Randy, it's a house full of men.
We're reclaiming the male spirit. Huh?

10:36.519 --> 10:38.029
By working on a dishwasher?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.950
It's either that or sitting around
a campfire telling stories naked.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.789
Where you guys going?
I'm kidding around.

10:48.879 --> 10:50.870
It's just you and me, Mark.
Unless you got something else to do.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.070
- No. I want to be with you.
- Great.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.789
- What are you doing?
- Getting naked.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.710
You don't have to get
all the way naked.

11:11.799 --> 11:14.179
All right, this is bare-chested men's
work. Come over here.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.230
All right. Sit down there.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.309
All right, first up.
Let's see them muscles.

11:36.320 --> 11:41.549
Yeah. I think you're ready for
your new Hank the Handyman tool belt.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.990
All right. Let's take a look at it.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.590
Little baby butt crack.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.779
All right. The number one rule
in home repair is safety.

11:52.879 --> 11:57.549
We're gonna rewire a major appliance.
we gotta cut the electricity off. All right?

11:57.639 --> 11:59.629
Come on out here.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.750
There. That

12:03.840 --> 12:05.549
is the fuse box.

12:05.639 --> 12:08.350
The electrical nerve center of our house.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.269
- Wow.
- You're darn right, wow.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.789
But now, we don't have to cut off
all the electricity.

12:14.879 --> 12:16.149
Just the section of the house
we're working on.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.950
That'd be the kitchen, up there…

12:18.799 --> 12:20.789
Kitchen…

12:21.799 --> 12:25.419
I shouldn't have labeled those
in pencil, should I?

12:27.639 --> 12:32.190
They're all faded and everything.
Look it… Well, kitchen's K…

12:32.279 --> 12:33.909
That's kitchen. There we go.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.620
All right, Hank the Handyman.
Come on. Let's go.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.509
We got to take off that access panel.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.710
All right.

12:44.159 --> 12:46.230
Look at all the wires in there.

12:48.039 --> 12:51.789
- Do you know what all those wires do?
- Yeah, of course.

12:51.879 --> 12:54.309
I wouldn't have taken it off if I didn't.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.750
Ground, we're looking to ground.

12:56.840 --> 13:00.309
Now, red is all…, red…

13:00.399 --> 13:03.549
Yellow, see…
The sun is yellow, it heats the ground -

13:03.639 --> 13:06.309
that's how they name stuff.

13:10.799 --> 13:13.149
Is that car all right?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.669
Shake it off.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.190
- Are you all right, Dad?
- Yeah.

13:37.919 --> 13:41.029
I did that to teach you
an important lesson.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.309
What's that, Dad?

13:44.399 --> 13:49.110
Well, when you work with electricity
it's a good idea to shut it all off.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.470
Now follow me upstairs.

13:50.559 --> 13:53.120
I'll show you how to treat
a severe electrical burn.

14:03.519 --> 14:08.639
Hello? No. Jill's not here.
I'll take a message, sure.

14:10.879 --> 14:13.590
Really?

14:14.879 --> 14:17.509
Yeah. I'll tell her.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.029
- Mom didn't get the job.
- She didn't?

14:20.120 --> 14:24.350
Nope. Listen, she's gonna
really need us now.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.590
When she gets home
she's gonna feel real sad.

14:27.679 --> 14:29.549
So, why don't you go upstairs
and wash up,

14:29.639 --> 14:32.230
cos she just loves it
when you're all clean.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.950
- Hey, Dad, Dad.
- Yeah, Randy.

14:35.039 --> 14:38.990
Look at this neat turtle shell.
I found it down at the creek.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.429
You didn't yank the turtle
out of there, did you?

14:42.519 --> 14:43.870
No.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.070
If I go down to that creek and find some
confused turtle swimming without a shell…

14:47.159 --> 14:49.950
Dad, I'm gonna go make it into a drum.

14:52.840 --> 14:56.909
Wilson that's the best part about being
a boy, is collecting all that useless junk.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.299
I wouldn't call it "useless". Tim.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.789
The ancient Malaysians used
the turtle shell as an aphrodisiac.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.309
Turtle shell?

15:06.399 --> 15:09.940
Wouldn't that hurt putting it on?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.419
Tim.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.950
- I'm out here, honey.
- Tim.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.950
Keep the boys off the phone.
I think I'm gonna hear about that job.

15:20.039 --> 15:21.259
- Honey, actually…
- I am so excited.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.750
Oh, gosh, you wouldn't believe it.
It was the best interview ever.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.870
- Really? Today?
- Oh, yeah. I nailed it.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.750
There is no way on Earth
that I am not gonna get this job.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.429
The Earth is such a big place.

15:33.519 --> 15:36.269
No, really. You should've seen me.
I was so impressive.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.669
I looked this vice president
right in the eye and I said…

15:40.879 --> 15:45.820
- Is that grease on your hand?
- No, that's an electrical burn.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.350
Did you touch the dishwasher?

15:49.440 --> 15:51.309
Did I touch the dishwasher?

15:51.399 --> 15:53.029
- You're a dead man.
- Jill, hold on.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.029
What did you do?
Show me what you did.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.590
Boy, are you cute when
you're panickin'.

15:56.679 --> 16:00.710
That big vein in your forehead
just sticks right out.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.539
What the hell is that?

16:02.639 --> 16:04.750
That is the power source
to your new dishwasher.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.710
- Take it out. No, take it out now.
- No, no.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.710
You don't like the fact
that I improved the dishwasher.

16:08.799 --> 16:11.230
Remember that yolk that wouldn't
come o the plate this morning?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.309
Watch this.

16:16.440 --> 16:20.870
Hear that hum? That's a Finley two-stage.
five-horse Blastmaster compressor.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.110
Air-delivery system is
18 cubic feet per minute.

16:23.200 --> 16:28.110
That should say "testosterone"
right on there, cos that…

16:28.200 --> 16:30.470
that is a man's dishwasher.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.629
Hey. Mark, you didn't tighten
that hex bolt like I asked you to.

16:54.039 --> 16:55.750
- Whoa, neat.
- Stay away from there.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.590
I don't want you to get hurt.
There's broken stuff there.

16:57.679 --> 16:59.509
I'm gonna call Tommy.
He's got…

16:59.600 --> 17:01.980
No, don't use the phone.
I'm waiting for a call about my job.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.108
Daddy already got that call.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.910
- Sorry you didn't get the job, Mom.
- Mark.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.789
I didn't get the job?

17:16.358 --> 17:19.069
I wanted to wait for
the right time to tell you.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.390
And the dishwasher exploded -
that wasn't it.

17:24.839 --> 17:28.309
I am really, really sorry.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.190
- You all right?
- I'll get the broom.

17:33.640 --> 17:37.950
You don't touch this.
I will clean all this up. I'll get…

17:38.039 --> 17:42.190
Hey. Look on the bright side, honey.
It wasn't a full load.

17:44.559 --> 17:47.430
I asked you not to touch the dishwasher.
But you didn't listen, did you?

17:47.519 --> 17:50.750
That's fine. I am not gonna get angry.

17:50.839 --> 17:53.589
I mean, it makes more work for me
but I don't mind.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.069
I like to work. It's just, you know.
too bad nobody'll hire me.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.029
- You don't have to feel bad.
- Don't tell me how to feel.

18:00.119 --> 18:02.470
- I'm just saying if it were me…
- It's not you, Tim. It's me.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.710
What I mean is you don't have to work.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.670
You don't really want me
to work, do you?

18:09.759 --> 18:11.109
No, no, no.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.430
- I make enough money for both of us.
- No, this is not about money.

18:14.519 --> 18:19.380
This is about me having a life
outside of this house. My autonomy.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.750
- Your autonomy.
- Yeah.

18:20.839 --> 18:24.069
- How do you spell that?
- Don't start.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.670
- Sweetheart, what you gotta do…
- Oh, this is great.

18:26.759 --> 18:29.990
Now I gotta take advice from a guy
who prances around a TV studio.

18:30.079 --> 18:32.380
- grunting like a baboon.
- What does that have to do with…?

18:32.480 --> 18:35.670
While Miss Binford Tool girl
flashes her big headlights.

18:35.759 --> 18:39.380
- Lisa?
- No. Al.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.549
What does Lisa have to do with this?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.869
She didn't take your job.
She's got a job.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.190
What?

19:03.839 --> 19:06.109
What a mess.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.630
- Hiya. Tim.
- Hi. Wilson.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.430
Boy, does that smell good.
Baby-back ribs?

19:14.519 --> 19:16.630
No, no, no. Squirrel.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.990
I tell you, Tim,
this is what it's all about -

19:22.079 --> 19:25.430
catch-of-the-day cooking,
sun setting,

19:25.519 --> 19:28.869
men standing around the campfire,
telling stories.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.190
- You mind if I tell you a story, Wilson?
- Campfire's lit, good neighbor.

19:33.279 --> 19:37.160
Jill didn't get the job she wants.
I tell her not to feel bad,

19:37.200 --> 19:41.600
she gets angry.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.430
All right, so then I tell her
what she should do,

19:44.519 --> 19:48.220
she jumps all over me
and then walks away.

19:48.319 --> 19:51.269
Sounds like you were having
an asymmetrical conversation.

19:51.359 --> 19:56.269
Asymmetrical.
How do you spell that?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.309
Let's just say "one-sided".

19:58.400 --> 20:01.309
You see, Tim, by nature
men are problem solvers

20:01.400 --> 20:03.630
but Jill didn't want you
to solve her problem.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.309
- She didn't?
- No, no, no.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.589
She just wanted you to listen
while she shared her feelings.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.710
Just stand there and listen?
Wouldn't that be like not doing anything?

20:12.799 --> 20:15.750
Sometimes the best thing
you can do, Tim, is nothing.

20:19.279 --> 20:22.549
Jill got mad at me
because I didn't listen to her.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.950
No. I think she got mad at you

20:24.039 --> 20:26.599
cos you blew up
the damn dishwasher.

20:31.599 --> 20:36.509
People often ask me, they say:
"Tim, why is your show so darn popular?"

20:36.599 --> 20:39.430
I tell you what I think.
I think that working with your hands

20:39.519 --> 20:44.380
puts you in touch with something
primitive, almost atavistic.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.150
It's almost like reclaiming
the male spirit, if you will.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.869
I think you know
where I'm headed with this one.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.500
I'm talking about a masculinism -
a flat-out, big-pectoral,

20:56.599 --> 20:59.269
Look-at-my-deltoids, hairy-chested
celebration of men.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.589
But this wouldn't be anti-female.
No, no, it's wrong to think that.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.509
Just like this sander

21:09.599 --> 21:12.710
vibrates in harmony
with the grain of the wood,

21:12.799 --> 21:16.579
we men should learn how to vibrate

21:16.680 --> 21:20.509
in harmony with our wives.

21:20.599 --> 21:23.029
so, if ya…

21:25.720 --> 21:29.420
if you have an occasion,
have a disagreement with your wife,

21:29.519 --> 21:34.230
you should be man enough
to not be asymmetrical.

21:34.319 --> 21:36.430
Because that would be one-sided.

21:36.519 --> 21:42.509
But you should be man enough
to look at her and say, "I'm sorry, Jill…"

21:42.599 --> 21:45.109
Or Betty or Ruth
or whatever her name would be.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.589
Anyway, let's finish sanding that table.

21:49.680 --> 21:53.549
What you said on the show today
was really sweet, Tim.

21:54.119 --> 21:58.670
I don't know if you noticed, but your name
is Jill, and I used the name Jill.

21:59.279 --> 22:01.549
Maybe you caught
the hidden double meaning.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.750
It was subtle, dear, but I did grasp it.

22:04.839 --> 22:08.309
- Am I forgiven?
- Yeah. Forgiven.

22:09.839 --> 22:12.869
Well, that's it for me,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.990
I'll finish up today with today's
household tip.

22:15.079 --> 22:17.829
A very important one,
as all of my tips are.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.829
Remember folks, always -
and I do mean always -

22:20.920 --> 22:24.869
label that fuse box in ink.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.069
See ya.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.910
You know, Jill, I still think
you're making a big mistake

22:35.000 --> 22:36.910
not letting me install that dishwasher.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.750
- I have other plans for you.
- You do?

22:40.680 --> 22:45.109
Yeah. When was the last time
that we spent any serious time together

22:45.200 --> 22:46.910
in the back seat of a car?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.509
When Brad threw up that pizza.

22:50.599 --> 22:54.109
No, no, really. If you apologized to me,
I think I should apologize to you.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.789
- Really?
- Yeah, and I really wanna do it right.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.099
Yeah?

22:57.200 --> 22:59.500
Back seat?

22:59.599 --> 23:02.670
Garage? Just like our honeymoon?

23:05.599 --> 23:08.230
Here, let me get that.

23:08.359 --> 23:10.069
And that.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.150
This Handsaver Lady Sott Touch
is one of our most popular models.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.710
Hey, let me in.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.069
Hey, lady, there's a crazy man
in your back yard.

23:24.680 --> 23:28.349
Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy
with the tool show on TV?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.390
Hey. Let me in.

23:32.799 --> 23:34.950
Stop waving at me.
Her. Get her.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.950
What's he doing now?

23:37.039 --> 23:39.990
I think he's tying to reclaim
his male spirit.
