WEBVTT

00:55.900 --> 00:57.400
Hyun-jun meets Myung-ho

00:58.033 --> 01:00.900
and reveals identity of Iris
and the risk of nuclear terrorism.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.033
Kidnapped by Hyun-jun,

01:08.400 --> 01:11.466
Chul-young decides to help Hyun-jun
to stop the war.

01:13.666 --> 01:15.400
We must prevent a war
between North and South.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.100
You and Hyun-jin are the only ones.

01:17.533 --> 01:18.866
You're under arrest for treason.

01:18.933 --> 01:22.300
Sang-hyun and Seung-hee secretly
track down the terrorists,

01:22.866 --> 01:23.966
but Director Baek

01:24.033 --> 01:25.866
- and Sa-woo stop them.
-Ms. Choi.

01:26.833 --> 01:28.000
Why are you doing this?

01:28.100 --> 01:29.766
Arrest Ms. Choi right now.

01:32.066 --> 01:35.000
After finding out
Hyun-jun has lost the terrorists,

01:35.333 --> 01:38.166
Myung-ho tries to arrest Gi-hoon
to find the nuclear bomb.

01:38.233 --> 01:40.700
Find Gi-hoon Yeon right now.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.833
With the terrorist's vehicle records,

01:44.033 --> 01:45.566
Hyun-jun finds the bunker.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.033
EPISODE 16

03:38.133 --> 03:40.966
They seem to have combined the detonator
and the enriched uranium here.

05:48.266 --> 05:49.300
I don't know

05:54.200 --> 05:55.266
where to start...

05:58.133 --> 05:59.266
I don't know what to say.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.300
Hug me.

07:59.266 --> 08:00.633
In front of Budapest Station,

08:02.066 --> 08:04.400
when the car you were in exploded
in front of me,

08:06.300 --> 08:07.400
I thought you died.

08:09.266 --> 08:11.400
I got out of the car
after getting Sa-woo's call.

08:12.433 --> 08:13.666
At that time, the station square

08:13.866 --> 08:16.133
was getting filled
with North Korean supreme guards.

08:21.566 --> 08:23.833
I lost North Koreans who were following me

08:25.333 --> 08:27.966
and went to the landing field
where we handed over Seung-ryong Hong.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.133
I was going to seize a light aircraft

08:31.433 --> 08:33.166
and escape Hungary.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.233
In the end,

08:38.799 --> 08:41.500
the aircraft crashed
due to Sa-woo's shooting.

08:42.766 --> 08:44.033
How could he...

08:45.233 --> 08:46.633
I thought it was possible.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.700
If I got caught
for killing Seong-cheol Yun

08:51.533 --> 08:53.533
and my identity was exposed,

08:55.766 --> 08:58.766
it could have caused a war
between North and South.

08:59.966 --> 09:01.100
Both Sa-woo and I,

09:02.800 --> 09:03.866
we...

09:05.533 --> 09:08.033
had to follow orders from our country.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
If I received such an order,

09:12.633 --> 09:14.200
I wouldn't have a choice, either.

09:17.533 --> 09:18.866
I decided to think that way.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.466
However,

09:22.800 --> 09:24.666
the order to kill Seong-cheol Yun

09:25.300 --> 09:26.666
wasn't given by the country.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.766
It was an order from Iris
which Director Baek is a part of.

09:31.833 --> 09:33.566
Sa-woo who aimed the gun at me

09:35.266 --> 09:36.500
was also Iris.

09:38.566 --> 09:39.700
Iris?

09:40.600 --> 09:41.700
What's that?

09:45.700 --> 09:46.700
You really don't know?

09:47.400 --> 09:48.433
I don't know.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.966
I recently became aware that
many questions that arose within the NSS

09:52.600 --> 09:55.666
are related to Director Baek and Sa-woo.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.666
What on earth is Iris?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.100
-Be on careful guard.
-Okay, sir.

10:28.433 --> 10:30.833
Why are you with the terrorists?

10:33.433 --> 10:34.666
Who are they?

10:39.866 --> 10:41.133
Sa-woo is coming.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.400
I saw about nine people.

10:43.633 --> 10:44.866
They're all armed.

10:47.866 --> 10:48.833
Leave now.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.100
I'll block Sa-woo.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.200
Wait, Seung-hee.

10:52.266 --> 10:53.366
Don't worry.

10:53.433 --> 10:54.700
He won't shoot me.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.100
Leave now.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.100
Hyun-jun.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.133
Don't move.

12:14.466 --> 12:15.533
Why are you doing this?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.766
Why are you acting like a fool?

12:23.100 --> 12:24.033
Shoot me.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.900
Like what you did to Hyun-jun,

12:27.500 --> 12:28.700
shoot me.

12:29.566 --> 12:30.600
Seung-hee Choi.

12:36.566 --> 12:37.800
Why did you change so much?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.066
I'm... sorry.

13:58.833 --> 13:59.800
I...

14:01.433 --> 14:03.066
knew Seung-hee was alive.

14:04.566 --> 14:06.000
All along.

14:08.533 --> 14:10.700
When I suddenly disappeared in Akita,

14:13.566 --> 14:14.566
I was

14:15.300 --> 14:16.566
back in Korea.

14:17.633 --> 14:20.233
Without following the order to kill you,

14:22.666 --> 14:24.133
I stopped contact

14:24.866 --> 14:26.266
with North Korean Supreme Guard,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.400
and the only way to go back to North

14:33.766 --> 14:34.800
was to kill

14:36.366 --> 14:38.500
San Baek. Then,

14:39.566 --> 14:41.800
I could take revenge for you.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.166
However,

14:47.166 --> 14:50.466
on my way to Seoul,
I was caught off guard.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.366
My identity was exposed,
so I was sent to the NSS.

14:55.833 --> 14:57.800
The person who came to interrogate me

15:02.666 --> 15:04.033
was Seung-hee.

15:05.866 --> 15:07.000
Her purpose

15:07.633 --> 15:09.433
wasn't to interrogate me.

15:11.666 --> 15:12.900
Instead, she wanted to know

15:14.266 --> 15:15.566
whether you were alive.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.366
I...

15:20.766 --> 15:22.033
remained silent until the end.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.966
With Seung-hee's help, who wanted me
to find out your whereabouts,

15:29.166 --> 15:30.600
I escaped from the NSS

15:32.800 --> 15:34.133
and returned to Akita.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.200
I met you again,

15:38.166 --> 15:39.600
but I couldn't tell you

15:43.300 --> 15:44.700
that Seung-hee was alive.

15:46.233 --> 15:47.200
Why?

15:49.100 --> 15:50.233
Why did you do that?

16:40.666 --> 16:41.866
What's going on all of a sudden?

16:42.666 --> 16:46.166
The President gave the order
to arrest Gi-hoon Yeon.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.700
Even if he's arrested,

16:51.300 --> 16:53.400
you know it can't be stopped.

16:53.966 --> 16:55.900
Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon
won't say anything.

16:56.066 --> 16:57.033
I know that,

16:57.566 --> 17:00.200
but there isn't any other way.

17:01.233 --> 17:04.733
I know Hyun-jun lost the terrorists.

17:07.433 --> 17:08.566
He's known as the person

17:09.300 --> 17:11.866
in charge of North Korean camp
during the summit discussion.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.700
Unless there's a justifiable reason,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.566
he won't be taken in easily.

17:15.933 --> 17:16.900
That's why

17:17.466 --> 17:19.099
we need your help.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.533
Does Hyun-jun know of this fact?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.433
I can't get a hold of him.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.599
We don't have time.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.500
Please cooperate with us.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.233
It's me.

17:50.133 --> 17:51.133
The Blue House

17:51.466 --> 17:53.200
came to arrest Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.233
They're asking me to arrest him.

17:55.966 --> 17:57.166
You know it's not possible yet.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.166
The Blue House knows
you've lost the spies.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.500
I don't think I can stop them anymore.

18:04.433 --> 18:05.533
I'll be right there.

18:10.366 --> 18:11.366
Did you want to see me?

18:12.466 --> 18:13.766
The South Korean government

18:14.733 --> 18:16.533
came to arrest Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.600
We must settle the matter quietly.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.366
Are you saying you'll hand over
Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon to South Korea?

18:24.200 --> 18:26.033
Commissioner Yeon is a traitor,

18:26.766 --> 18:28.333
but we can't hand in someone

18:28.966 --> 18:31.000
from Labor Party Central Commission
to South Korea.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.266
Gi-hoon Yeon is no longer our people.

18:38.966 --> 18:39.900
If he were,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.566
he wouldn't have insisted
upon sacrifices of many.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.166
Is the Commissioner inside?

19:08.233 --> 19:09.133
Yes, sir.

19:39.633 --> 19:40.866
It was confirmed.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.200
Our spies who remained to get rid of

19:43.533 --> 19:45.600
Hyun-jun were attacked.

19:45.666 --> 19:48.433
This wouldn't have happened
if you followed the orders.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.233
I'm sorry.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.900
Stay alert until tomorrow.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.000
Okay, sir.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.533
Tomorrow at 5 p.m.,

19:55.633 --> 19:57.266
after the explosion,

19:58.066 --> 19:59.566
escape via route as prearranged.

20:02.766 --> 20:03.666
Come in.

20:08.566 --> 20:09.466
What is it?

20:09.533 --> 20:11.600
Secretary Jung
from the Blue House is here.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
Hyung-jun Jung?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.200
Why did he come without calling?

20:16.600 --> 20:19.033
He said it's an urgent matter
he'd like to discuss in person.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.866
What are you doing?

20:34.933 --> 20:35.866
I'm sorry.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.200
I thought about it a lot,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.933
but I can't allow civilian sacrifices
for a war between North and South.

20:44.466 --> 20:46.166
I've always believed you.

20:47.466 --> 20:49.266
Will you betray me like this?

20:49.833 --> 20:52.433
Compared to your betrayal
of the country and the public,

20:53.033 --> 20:54.533
my betrayal is nothing.

20:56.433 --> 20:59.066
What you're doing won't change anything.

21:00.266 --> 21:01.366
When the morning comes,

21:02.233 --> 21:03.966
a nuclear bomb will explode in Seoul.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.966
Starting then,

21:07.100 --> 21:09.366
the republic will become a new world.

21:10.733 --> 21:12.033
Until the morning comes,

21:12.900 --> 21:14.166
there's a lot of time.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.533
Let's go.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.566
Is this

22:13.700 --> 22:15.700
why you aimed a gun at me?

22:18.033 --> 22:20.000
You spoke of the people and our country,

22:21.100 --> 22:24.600
but your real plan was to sell me
by cooperating with

22:26.233 --> 22:27.666
South Korea?

22:28.366 --> 22:30.000
That's a misunderstanding,
Commissioner Yeon.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.166
The reason why we're arresting you is

22:37.533 --> 22:38.600
not because

22:39.266 --> 22:41.966
you're a commissioner
of Labor Party Central Commission.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.500
It's because you're a member of Iris.

22:57.933 --> 22:58.900
Take him.

24:45.466 --> 24:46.466
Go in.

25:12.466 --> 25:13.533
Have a seat.

25:16.933 --> 25:17.933
I don't

25:19.700 --> 25:21.000
have time to exhaust myself

25:21.600 --> 25:23.600
with a conflict between us.

25:24.466 --> 25:26.200
If you continue being like this,

25:27.466 --> 25:29.200
I can't protect you anymore.

25:29.666 --> 25:31.833
I never asked you to protect me.

25:33.466 --> 25:34.366
Seung-hee.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.966
What is Iris?

25:37.533 --> 25:38.866
I heard you and Sa-woo

25:39.866 --> 25:41.000
are Iris.

25:42.066 --> 25:43.033
What is it

25:44.033 --> 25:45.833
that you tried to kill Hyun-jun?

25:46.866 --> 25:49.433
What is it that you betrayed
the NSS and the country?

25:49.933 --> 25:51.800
If Hyun-jun said such a thing,

25:51.866 --> 25:54.266
it was simply a lie he imagined.

25:56.700 --> 25:57.800
There's no such a thing.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.733
Whatever you may have heard anywhere,

26:00.800 --> 26:02.733
I'm the one whom you should trust.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.266
Then,

26:08.966 --> 26:10.200
what you're saying is Sa-woo...

26:10.733 --> 26:11.733
Don't tell anyone.

26:12.066 --> 26:13.400
Otherwise, I'll get called in too.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.000
Ms. Choi got called in now.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.333
Even Seung-hee?

26:17.500 --> 26:19.666
We're in a state of emergency
due to nuclear terrorism,

26:20.066 --> 26:22.666
but what is he doing by
calling everyone to his office?

26:24.566 --> 26:25.700
Where are you going?

26:26.633 --> 26:27.566
You,

26:27.633 --> 26:29.600
be careful what you say to whom.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.133
Gosh...

27:13.066 --> 27:14.566
You can ask me

27:16.700 --> 27:18.000
any questions.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.900
-I'll tell you everything.
-I don't want to listen to you

27:21.966 --> 27:23.066
or believe you anymore.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.100
Actually,

27:26.666 --> 27:27.700
I must say it.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.133
Why should you?

27:29.700 --> 27:31.800
Everything started with you.

27:32.933 --> 27:34.266
The reason why I'm here...

27:36.400 --> 27:37.466
is you, Seung-hee Choi.

27:39.433 --> 27:40.933
It was all because of you.

27:42.233 --> 27:43.300
Is that why

27:45.000 --> 27:47.333
you tried to kill Hyun-jun in Hungary?

27:48.666 --> 27:49.866
Why can't you say anything?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.100
Tell me an excuse.

27:55.166 --> 27:56.233
It was better...

27:59.466 --> 28:01.200
that he died in my hands.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.500
What do you mean?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.200
I can't do it.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.133
I'll have to find someone else
if you can't do it.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.466
Tell Seung-hee Choi to come in.

28:17.666 --> 28:18.700
Why would you...

28:20.900 --> 28:22.000
Even if you were me...

28:25.100 --> 28:26.266
If it hadn't been me,

28:30.366 --> 28:31.900
it had to be you.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.666
I couldn't

28:39.033 --> 28:41.766
let you kill Hyun-jun you love.

28:43.433 --> 28:44.733
Ever since

28:46.000 --> 28:47.500
I fell in love with you,

28:48.800 --> 28:50.500
I was always standing
at the edge of a cliff.

28:50.966 --> 28:53.633
What difference does it make,
to talk about your feelings now?

28:55.766 --> 28:56.700
So...

28:58.866 --> 29:01.066
What difference does it make
if I understand you now?

29:06.333 --> 29:08.066
Even if Hyun-jun forgives you,

29:10.200 --> 29:11.800
I'll never forgive you.

29:14.333 --> 29:15.366
Seung-hee.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.933
How did it go?

29:33.300 --> 29:35.100
Gi-hoon Yeon died.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.766
He was sniped while we were arresting him.

29:38.233 --> 29:39.566
He was sniped?

29:40.933 --> 29:44.300
Did they know we were arresting Gi-hoon?

29:44.766 --> 29:45.966
I think so.

29:46.233 --> 29:48.633
Wasn't the arrest of Gi-hoon Yeon

29:49.300 --> 29:50.833
decided only between you and me?

29:51.400 --> 29:52.633
How could this

29:53.100 --> 29:54.633
be exposed?

29:55.400 --> 29:59.933
We're under a watch much closer
than we had expected.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.233
He's waiting for you.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.366
Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon

30:40.133 --> 30:41.966
said the bomb would set off in the morning

30:42.766 --> 30:45.933
and the coup of the Republic
would proceed as scheduled.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.366
Even if the bomb sets off,

30:49.033 --> 30:50.766
we must stop the war.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.966
I'll call Commissioner Kim.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.133
To stop the coup,

30:57.300 --> 30:58.933
I'll reveal everything.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.300
Go back to North now

31:02.500 --> 31:04.366
do everything you can to stop the coup.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.166
I'll do everything that I can.

31:29.433 --> 31:32.633
I'm going back to the Republic
to stop the coup.

31:32.866 --> 31:34.266
It'll be difficult,

31:34.933 --> 31:36.466
but stop the nuclear terror attack.

31:36.533 --> 31:39.400
There's no clue to find the explosion site
or Do-chul Kang's whereabouts.

31:39.866 --> 31:42.200
Let me know if you find anything
from anyone

31:42.766 --> 31:44.200
related to Do-chul Kang.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.066
Hello, sir.

32:04.866 --> 32:06.000
When the morning comes,

32:07.166 --> 32:09.700
a nuclear bomb will explode
somewhere in Seoul.

32:10.266 --> 32:12.966
It's frustrating
that there's nothing we can do.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.000
It's too early to give up.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.700
I'm not giving up.

32:18.866 --> 32:20.966
The only person I can still trust

32:21.933 --> 32:22.933
is you.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.000
Is something going on?

34:12.233 --> 34:13.733
Comrade Gi-hoon Yeon is dead.

34:18.133 --> 34:19.033
What?

34:19.633 --> 34:21.066
Do we have to stop the operation?

34:22.133 --> 34:23.133
No.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.466
We proceed as planned.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.866
The nuclear bomb will explode

34:32.300 --> 34:34.900
in Gwanghwamun at 5 p.m.

34:35.766 --> 34:37.166
Who will install the nuclear bomb?

34:37.233 --> 34:38.300
It's already done.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.966
They must be heading to Gwanghwamun now.

34:45.066 --> 34:46.066
What do you mean?

34:46.900 --> 34:48.233
Tell me more details.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.500
The nuclear bomb

34:49.900 --> 34:51.333
is placed in a city tour bus

34:51.699 --> 34:53.866
that tours the city of Seoul.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.033
At 5 p.m.,

34:55.100 --> 34:58.166
when the city tour bus stops
at Sejong Center in Gwanghwamun,

34:59.700 --> 35:01.433
by using this remote control,

35:01.566 --> 35:02.733
we'll explode the nuclear bomb.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.033
After the explosion is confirmed,

35:05.500 --> 35:07.266
we'll move to Jeongok Pier.

35:09.666 --> 35:12.200
We'll escape South Korea on a boat.

35:51.466 --> 35:52.766
This is San Baek.

35:56.866 --> 35:58.200
Okay, I got it.

35:59.566 --> 36:00.966
I'll prepare that.

36:18.033 --> 36:19.166
Come to my office.

36:22.000 --> 36:22.866
Who are you?

36:22.933 --> 36:23.866
Don't move.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.366
We are from Secret Service.

36:27.433 --> 36:28.466
Please cooperate with us.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.366
We don't have time.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.266
While Sung-sik is incinerating the files,

36:44.566 --> 36:45.833
you should buy time.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.066
We can't end it like this.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.700
I'll stop them.

36:48.766 --> 36:49.766
Listen carefully.

36:51.866 --> 36:53.166
Gi-hoon Yeon was killed.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.300
We'll be arrested.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.333
We can't stop that.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.033
For now, we must trust the headquarters

37:01.800 --> 37:03.533
and follow orders.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.433
I packed everything.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.633
Incinerate them completely.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.200
All we need is to buy time,

37:17.900 --> 37:19.666
so don't make unnecessary sacrifices.

37:20.766 --> 37:21.700
Okay, sir.

38:30.566 --> 38:31.933
We'll stop them here.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.833
Okay.

38:50.733 --> 38:52.533
We confirmed the Director
is in his office,

38:53.433 --> 38:54.566
so find the rest of them.

38:54.866 --> 38:55.800
Okay, sir.

39:16.433 --> 39:17.400
Director Baek.

39:17.766 --> 39:18.866
This is Kang-oh Yoo.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.600
Open the door.

39:22.233 --> 39:23.233
Director Baek.

39:24.133 --> 39:26.100
Resisting won't solve anything.

39:27.833 --> 39:28.933
Just open the door.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.766
We found them.

39:52.333 --> 39:53.333
They're on the rooftop.

39:54.700 --> 39:57.300
Okay, I got it.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.233
Hurry.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.833
Is there a way to open the door?

40:28.033 --> 40:29.400
Unless opened from inside,

40:29.866 --> 40:31.000
there's no way.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.333
This is the Head of National Security.

40:49.333 --> 40:50.666
Until things are settled,

40:51.666 --> 40:53.300
I'll be in charge of the NSS.

40:54.933 --> 40:56.033
I ask for your cooperation.

40:56.566 --> 40:57.500
Okay, sir.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.066
Where is Sa-woo?

41:01.666 --> 41:02.766
On the rooftop,

41:03.266 --> 41:04.566
he's blocking

41:05.033 --> 41:06.033
the Secret Service agents.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.566
Surrender.

41:12.366 --> 41:14.200
We don't want more sacrifices.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.933
Magazine.

41:19.633 --> 41:20.766
This is the last one.

41:27.766 --> 41:28.666
Ma'am.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.533
The Director and Agent Jin's

41:30.733 --> 41:31.933
arrest was ordered.

41:49.133 --> 41:50.100
It's me.

41:50.766 --> 41:51.800
It's been incinerated.

41:52.366 --> 41:53.333
Surrender.

42:53.766 --> 42:54.600
Okay, sir.

42:54.766 --> 42:56.133
Both of them are arrested.

43:17.166 --> 43:18.333
Starting now,

43:19.200 --> 43:20.633
we're removing San Baek

43:23.033 --> 43:24.166
from the director position.

45:03.066 --> 45:05.666
CHANGDEOKGUNG CHANGGYEONGGUNG

45:08.733 --> 45:10.233
GWANGHWAMUN PLAZA

45:10.300 --> 45:13.433
I've linked together
all of the destinations in the GPS.

45:13.633 --> 45:14.666
I heard that

45:14.800 --> 45:17.300
the enriched uranium sphere
that Chul-young brought, is six kilograms.

45:17.566 --> 45:18.700
For such an amount,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.333
it's a 21 kiloton tactical nuclear weapon.

45:23.266 --> 45:25.366
That means the explosion
area of direct influence

45:26.966 --> 45:28.233
is under two kilometers.

45:31.966 --> 45:33.566
ITAEWON

45:39.700 --> 45:42.433
If we assume the marked areas
as ground zero...

45:47.966 --> 45:49.866
JONGNO

45:53.600 --> 45:56.466
The purpose of the nuclear terror
is to start a war.

45:58.566 --> 46:01.266
Then, they must have more specific target.

46:14.466 --> 46:16.466
Honey.

46:26.233 --> 46:28.233
Where did you install the bomb?

46:28.866 --> 46:31.633
Even if you tell me now, you'll be killed.

46:34.100 --> 46:36.233
However, we'll let your family live.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.400
Let me ask one more time.

47:21.566 --> 47:24.200
Where did you install the bomb?

47:38.833 --> 47:40.666
Mother, Father...

47:42.900 --> 47:44.666
It's your son's turn.

47:48.266 --> 47:49.433
Where is it?

47:52.866 --> 47:53.933
Stop!

48:22.166 --> 48:23.933
The targets are
Government Management Office,

48:24.366 --> 48:25.500
the U.S. Embassy

48:26.533 --> 48:27.600
and the Blue House.

48:27.666 --> 48:31.133
The area of influence for a 21 kiloton
tactical nuclear bomb is two kilometers.

48:32.133 --> 48:34.066
A place that can damage
all three at once...

48:38.800 --> 48:39.966
is only one.

48:58.366 --> 48:59.466
What happened?

49:00.066 --> 49:00.933
What?

49:01.733 --> 49:02.800
Okay.

49:04.433 --> 49:06.266
The predicted point
for the nuclear bomb explosion

49:06.500 --> 49:07.800
is Gwanghwamun.

49:07.866 --> 49:10.600
You must evade to the bunker now.

50:28.766 --> 50:31.466
Please send detailed information
on the wireless receiver of the detonator.

50:42.866 --> 50:44.733
Okay, I understand.

50:46.733 --> 50:47.866
We found the point of attack.

50:51.733 --> 50:52.866
It's Gwanghwamun.

50:52.933 --> 50:54.100
What's the exact location?

50:54.266 --> 50:56.433
We don't know where it's installed
or the time of explosion.

50:57.700 --> 51:00.466
Gwanghwamun is where
important organizations are located.

51:00.833 --> 51:02.466
A square has been built recently,

51:02.566 --> 51:03.933
so it's always quite populated.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.033
Unless we find the exact location,

51:07.700 --> 51:08.933
it's impossible to search.

51:09.033 --> 51:11.600
If they're using the detonator
from the NSS,

51:11.666 --> 51:13.833
they'll explode it using
the long-distance wireless method.

51:14.466 --> 51:15.966
We must jam the Gwanghwamun area.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.333
The wireless receiver of the detonator

51:19.566 --> 51:22.033
is designed to pick up
all radio waves in the area.

51:22.500 --> 51:24.233
Including cell phones
and short-wave receivers,

51:24.300 --> 51:26.100
we must jam all types of devices.

51:26.166 --> 51:28.666
They could have changed it
to explode with another method.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.466
We'll just have to hope they didn't.

51:32.933 --> 51:34.500
Within four kilometers
of Gwanghwamun area,

51:34.600 --> 51:36.266
-radio jam everything.
-Okay, sir.

51:36.633 --> 51:37.800
How long will it take?

51:39.200 --> 51:41.233
About 20 minutes.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.966
-Do it as quickly as possible.
-Yes, sir.

51:47.033 --> 51:49.366
Where did you receive this information?

51:49.433 --> 51:51.033
I think Hyun-jun called the Blue House.

51:57.566 --> 51:58.600
Where are you going?

53:04.033 --> 53:05.300
We have five minutes left.

54:08.066 --> 54:09.400
Radio jamming is complete.

54:14.333 --> 54:17.133
Send the SWAT and EOD to Gwanghwamun.

54:35.800 --> 54:36.966
Why isn't it exploding?

54:37.633 --> 54:38.800
Is something wrong?

54:40.700 --> 54:41.733
There's no way.

54:42.400 --> 54:44.733
I also checked several times.

55:03.633 --> 55:04.933
We'll go to Gwanghwamun

55:05.900 --> 55:07.833
and explode the bomb ourselves.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.433
Are you saying we should all die?

55:15.466 --> 55:17.100
To explode it ourselves,

55:17.966 --> 55:19.033
that's the only way.

55:19.666 --> 55:21.200
What are you talking about?

55:21.266 --> 55:22.700
We're not here to die.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.466
Shut up and listen to me.

55:26.666 --> 55:29.366
If we succeed the mission
by sacrificing our lives,

55:31.133 --> 55:32.533
our country and the people

55:33.533 --> 55:35.066
will remember us.

55:40.300 --> 55:43.266
Tae-young, Kang-seok, Jae-hyun.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.066
You should stay behind

55:47.366 --> 55:49.233
in case we fail.

56:03.833 --> 56:05.100
What's the current situation?

56:05.766 --> 56:07.766
We found that the bomb was
placed inside Gwanghwamun,

56:08.066 --> 56:10.233
so we jammed all radio waves in the area.

56:10.633 --> 56:14.133
How does that help with stopping
a nuclear terror attack?

56:14.533 --> 56:16.733
The nuclear bomb operates
with radio wave signals.

56:17.266 --> 56:19.633
If the bomb is in Gwanghwamun
where radio waves are jammed,

56:20.566 --> 56:21.900
it won't explode.

57:11.733 --> 57:14.833
I've linked together
all of the destinations in the GPS.

57:15.300 --> 57:17.766
Their goal was determined
when they planned the attack.

57:21.133 --> 57:22.866
Our task is to stop the summit discussion

57:23.133 --> 57:25.066
between North and South that's in session.

57:36.366 --> 57:37.866
JONGNO

57:42.066 --> 57:43.433
Look at the dates.

57:44.133 --> 57:46.433
They wandered around all these places
for the past three days.

57:47.500 --> 57:48.866
Why do you think they did so?

57:51.500 --> 57:52.900
GWANGHWAMUN THE BLUE HOUSE

57:58.733 --> 57:59.666
Follow me!

58:06.933 --> 58:08.466
Check the compartment!

58:43.333 --> 58:44.333
It's not in the compartment.
