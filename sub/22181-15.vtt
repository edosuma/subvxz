WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.829
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.873 --> 00:05.179
-What was that
back there?
Cape tricks.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.310
I've been fighting
with a cape for three years

00:06.354 --> 00:07.790
and all it seems to do
is get in the way.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.357
I can help with that.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.012
On Mars,
we called it Za-alet.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.144
It means "decay of memory."

00:14.188 --> 00:15.580
Dementia.

00:15.624 --> 00:19.323
Worldkillers, unite
beneath the standard of Reign.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.630
Now all we have to do
is find them.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.110
I think something
is wrong with me.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.461
I keep losing time.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.158
Sam, your blackouts
are coinciding with something,
I just--

00:28.202 --> 00:29.203
Silence!

00:32.206 --> 00:34.034
Sam, I know what's wrong
with you.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.992
I'm gonna make you better.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.306
-Start recording.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.438
This is day three
with the subject.

00:48.178 --> 00:51.225
My preliminary findings
show a karyokinetic anomaly,

00:51.268 --> 00:54.532
confirming my initial
hypothesis that she
has been transforming.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.925
Mutating into the other.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.014
Subject remains
in a medically-induced coma,

00:58.319 --> 01:00.408
however, further testing
will require consciousness.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.759
So I will now
end sedation on the subject.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.980
-Stop recording.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.986
When you wake up,

01:15.510 --> 01:16.815
please be Sam.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.995
And, go.
-Astronaut.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.695
-Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.131
That... That doesn't count.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.393
Why?

01:29.437 --> 01:30.829
Because you're
shape-shifting, Dad.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.093
Oh.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.533
Human games have
so many rules.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.665
He didn't break
any of the rules.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.319
You know what, it's fine.
Just let him have it.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.842
-We're slaughtering 'em
anyway.
-Hah!

01:43.886 --> 01:46.149
Hey, the Martian
Man-Father strikes again.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.151
"Martian Man

01:48.195 --> 01:51.067
Fine.
The Martian Dad Hunter.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.200
Okay. We need more wine.
Keep playing.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.072
-I'll come and help you.
-Okay...

01:56.377 --> 01:57.987
I'm really glad
you guys came.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.249
Yeah, me too. Me too.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.426
-Movie. Nine words.
-There you go.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.647
Your dad, he's...
He's strong.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.128
Yeah, he seems to be
taking this better than I am.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.740
He's doing everything he can
to keep his mind sharp.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.655
He's--

02:13.698 --> 02:15.352
The Cook, the Thief,
His Wife & Her Lover.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.311
-Cheating again
Come on, Dad,

02:17.354 --> 02:18.834
no mind-reading.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.793
You keep accusing me
of not following the rules.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.099
You are one to talk.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.321
My son used to wait
for me to leave,

02:27.364 --> 02:29.540
and the moment I had gone,

02:30.411 --> 02:33.936
he would switch around
the pieces
on the Ok-Rock-Tockboard.

02:35.285 --> 02:38.767
When I caught him, he blamed
his imaginary friend...

02:40.247 --> 02:42.336
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.076
You had an imaginary friend?

02:44.120 --> 02:46.209
-No, I--
Oh, yes, he did.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.907
You said he was
a fifth-dimensional imp,

02:48.951 --> 02:51.997
who came just
to move the pieces.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.564
What was his name?

02:56.959 --> 02:58.265
-Zook.
-Zook!

02:58.308 --> 03:00.397
-"Zook! Zook did it!"
-"Zook!"

03:00.441 --> 03:01.746
"It was Zook!"

03:01.790 --> 03:02.965
That was you.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.491
Wait a minute.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.887
It's a trouble alert.
There's a big disturbance
downtown.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.324
Well, time to get back
to the salt mine.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.200
What? I like this shirt.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.910
Can't hold your liquor?

03:35.171 --> 03:36.607
-She just went crazy,

03:36.651 --> 03:38.087
started wrecking the place.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.828
You get everyone out of here.
I'll take care of her.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.314
I had the high score on that.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.737
Well, she's a Kalanorian.
No criminal record.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.478
Then why did she go
all Road Houseon me?

04:21.522 --> 04:23.132
Demos says
she wasn't provoked.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.830
Kalanorians are psychics.
Empaths.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.355
Well, maybe she got
her signals crossed
with another psychic?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.578
I'm not seeing any
psionic anomalies.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.233
Well, she tore that bar up.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.716
Her species are prone
to outbursts during
astronomical events.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.240
-Mercury's in retrograde.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.940
More like complex luminal
and gravatic shifts

04:48.984 --> 04:52.161
that determine
Kalanorian brain function,
but sure, astrology.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.684
Put her in containment.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.730
We have these Worldkillers
to focus on.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.083
Anything?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.650
We've been using
every device on our ship

05:02.693 --> 05:05.174
to try and track Purity
and Reign since
the subway attack,

05:05.217 --> 05:06.349
but there's no sign of them.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.396
As they say on the farm,
"Not a peep."

05:10.571 --> 05:13.051
Imra thinks they're looking
for Pestilence.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.923
Who we still know
nothing about.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.534
Right. And based on
our experiences
with the Blight in the future,

05:17.578 --> 05:19.319
Pestilence should be
the easiest to see coming.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.888
The Blight presents
as diseases, plagues,
real Old Testament stuff.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.368
-Yeah.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.283
I think this should qualify.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.591
Whoa.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.899
Brainy and Imra went
to check it out.

05:34.943 --> 05:38.381
Ooh! Better them and not us.
I hate the cold.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.775
Very thin skin. Plus,
the rivers of blood, yeah.

05:40.818 --> 05:44.344
What if Reign and Purity
find Pestilence before we do?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.389
-They won't.
And if they do,
we'll be ready.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.305
Which means it's time for us
to start training.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.612
Teach me how you fight
in the future.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.310
Think it's time
we make you a Legionnaire.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.151
Relax.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.154
How long
have I been sleeping?

06:14.461 --> 06:15.636
Where is Ruby?

06:16.288 --> 06:18.334
She's with her nanny.
She's safe.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.078
Tell me,

06:23.600 --> 06:24.993
what's wrong with me?

06:25.602 --> 06:27.865
Most of your blood tests
came back as normal.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.347
But I also studied
your salt replication process.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.263
There's trace evidence
that your cells

06:34.306 --> 06:37.222
have undergone
a mitotal mutation that
I've only seen in insects.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.963
It indicates metamorphosis.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.968
When you black out,
your body seems to be changing
on a cellular level.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.145
"Changing"

06:48.190 --> 06:49.409
To her.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.541
Reign.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.326
I'm not an alien.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.634
I don't have special powers.
I bleed.

06:57.678 --> 06:58.983
I get sick.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.159
My adoption papers
say I'm from Scranton.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.988
Look, I know you mean well,
but I don't have the patience
for this,

07:04.032 --> 07:05.512
I have to go see my daughter.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.340
Wait. I thought this might be
hard for you to accept,

07:08.384 --> 07:12.301
so I also compiled a timeline
of the blackouts so
you could remember.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.694
This is the first one.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.393
And the next.

07:18.829 --> 07:19.830
And the next.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.746
And the next.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.922
This was a mistake.
I need to go see my daughter.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.149
Lena, are you kidding me?

07:34.192 --> 07:35.846
Let me out.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.240
I can't.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.373
You asked me to help you.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.469
She doesn't fight,
she hunts.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.819
All power, all aggression.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.342
-Stop.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.997
Wow.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.521
Yeah, Brainy stitched
this together
from every bank-cam,

07:58.565 --> 08:00.654
satellite image, and cellphone
video he could find.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.787
-That's so cool.
The future's cool!

08:04.614 --> 08:06.398
Welcome to the 31st century.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.574
Huh!

08:07.617 --> 08:09.271
Yeah, but
what's the point, though?

08:09.750 --> 08:11.708
Big chunk of concrete
is not gonna do anything to me

08:11.752 --> 08:13.449
that her fists
couldn't do better.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.585
She's playing with her food.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.848
That's how I beat her.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.807
Can... Can we rewind?

08:26.462 --> 08:29.465
Yeah, she's got me beat
on muscle, somehow.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.512
But all that power
is coming from the ground,

08:32.555 --> 08:35.340
-from that planted foot
right there.
-Mm-hmm.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.299
And she doesn't bother
with footwork.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.388
So, when she goes high,

08:39.954 --> 08:41.259
that's my window.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.785
It's also where your cape
comes in.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.093
If she wants to be a bull,
you be a bullfighter.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.228
I have done
something amazing.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.751
Did you find Pestilence?

08:54.795 --> 08:56.536
I have done something okay.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.580
You, come here.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.408
What?

09:00.975 --> 09:03.543
I have fixed your old suit.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.022
-Winn.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.417
Hey, can I say it?
Can I say it

09:08.460 --> 09:09.810
Yes.

09:09.853 --> 09:10.985
Suit up.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.950
I, um, brought lunch.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.132
You are worried
about something, my son.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.178
Speak.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.746
Uh...

09:33.529 --> 09:34.661
Just...

09:36.010 --> 09:37.011
How are you feeling?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.360
Never better.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.189
Ok-Rock-Tock
is good for my mind.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.234
Sure.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.281
Memory, strategy.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.499
More than that.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.676
It hears my thoughts.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.504
It connects me
to my ancestors

09:52.548 --> 09:54.681
as I navigate
the labyrinth of the board.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.639
Centering me.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.641
Easing my mind.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.339
That's good. That's good,
and it's, um...

10:02.340 --> 10:03.472
It's helping?

10:04.908 --> 10:07.607
It's been 12 hours and
46 minutes since you asked.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.087
You fear my condition
has worsened in this time?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.046
No.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.050
It's just that...

10:17.225 --> 10:19.227
We did bring in a Kalanorian

10:20.097 --> 10:22.839
who had a psychic breakdown
at a bar.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.928
I thought I felt something.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.669
It was you?

10:26.930 --> 10:29.324
You know I have
been doing the Ta'ar Ka'riq

10:29.367 --> 10:31.239
to keep my memories
from fleeing.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.720
You should have told me
there were Kalanorians here.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.765
I'm sorry, Father.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.289
In any event, I will
be more careful.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.423
Now, come.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.686
Play a match with me.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.122
I never tire of beating you.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.821
I got to get back to work.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.084
Why don't you
bring the game to the DEO,
and we can play later?

10:50.127 --> 10:54.044
As soon as I finish
my game against Zook.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.920
He was right here.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.837
Where is he?

11:04.446 --> 11:05.490
Dad?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.016
A joke.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.713
Not funny, Dad.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.846
Only because you did not
see your face.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.121
Have you thought
about what I told you?

11:27.469 --> 11:30.907
I get squeamish whenever
Ruby asks me to kill a spider.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.737
How could you possibly think
I could kill people?

11:34.781 --> 11:36.608
I don't think you could.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.654
So, you think
I have a split personality?

11:39.307 --> 11:40.656
Essentially, yes.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.267
Reign is a completely
separate entity.

11:43.311 --> 11:46.749
When she takes over,
you lose all awareness,
all control.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.795
Your DNA rewrites itself.

11:49.665 --> 11:54.931
Please, Sam, understand that
I would not tell you this
if I wasn't sure.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.934
So this is what I get
for asking for your help?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.328
What's that supposed to mean?

12:00.371 --> 12:03.287
You ask an oncologist,
they'll say cancer.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.725
You ask a surgeon,
they'll cut you open.

12:06.987 --> 12:10.686
You ask a Luthor,
they'll tell you
you're a supervillain.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.476
What?

12:20.130 --> 12:22.089
Just tell him
I'll call him back, okay?

12:24.091 --> 12:25.179
He's where?

12:29.226 --> 12:31.925
James, I really wish
you'd call first.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276
Yeah, I tried that
for a week.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.538
I just, uh...

12:37.365 --> 12:39.106
Figured maybe I had
better luck in person.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.413
Listen, I'm sorry,
I'm in the middle
of an emergency.

12:42.718 --> 12:45.416
Oh. I'm sorry.
Is everything okay, or...

12:53.163 --> 12:56.776
An employee of mine
asked for help
with a problem.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.692
And now that
I've diagnosed a solution,
they don't wanna accept it.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.564
Sounds like they need
an intervention.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.175
Tried that.
It's not going well.

13:05.219 --> 13:08.570
You know, I had a roommate
in college.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.528
Great guy,

13:10.572 --> 13:13.183
but he started takin'
something, I'm not sure
what it was,

13:13.227 --> 13:15.533
but he would come home
all hours of the night

13:15.577 --> 13:17.448
and just tear the place apart.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.190
You know, I tried to tell him
that he had a problem,

13:20.234 --> 13:21.801
but he never wanted
to hear it.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.020
So I just kept cleaning up
after him.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.589
Did he ever acknowledge
what was wrong with him?

13:28.546 --> 13:29.765
See, that's the thing.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.724
No matter how bad
you wanna help somebody,

13:32.768 --> 13:35.031
all you can really do
is hold up a mirror.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.000
Wow.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.613
-You always said
I cleaned up nicely.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.095
It's just like old times, huh?

13:56.618 --> 13:57.924
Training again.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.882
Except I basically had to
twist your arm to train.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.232
You had no interest
in being a hero.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.278
And now...

14:05.932 --> 14:07.194
I've come a long way.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.458
You ready?

14:11.285 --> 14:12.895
Yeah, I was born ready.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.906
If she's not gonna
use her feet, use yours.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.952
But can my cape even do that?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.128
Yeah.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.260
I did not know that.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.654
Yeah, I won't either
for another 1,000 years.

14:32.697 --> 14:36.397
We studied your cape
to make mine,
it's Kryptonian meta-material.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.442
Smartcloth.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.140
Show me.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.797
Dad, while you're here,
why don't I run you
by the Med bay,

14:45.841 --> 14:47.582
have Alex run some new scans
on you?

14:47.625 --> 14:50.977
-Shouldn't take long.
-No. It is time for me
to pray.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.286
Hey, any sign
of the Worldkillers?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.461
Still nothin'.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.810
Well, you can catch a break,

14:58.854 --> 15:00.508
I'm gonna take over scanning
for a while.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
I know what I'm doing.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.561
You don't need to
take over anything, Schott.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.433
I didn't say that you didn't
know what you were doing.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.087
You need to get out of here
right now.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.311
Damn.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.834
Keep your back foot planted.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.010
You have it.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.281
Why isn't this working?

15:35.673 --> 15:36.718
I don't know.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.165
I mean, the steps are easy,
I should be getting this.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.558
Well, go easy on yourself.

15:50.601 --> 15:51.994
The first time
you trained me,

15:52.038 --> 15:54.344
you kicked me around the room
like a hacky sack.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.519
It was humbling.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.869
-I was--
-Hungover.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.349
You were hungover.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.524
I'd forgotten that part.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.135
Can we keep training, please?

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
'Cause I programmed
the system.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.362
I input every parameter,
every radiation marker
to trace them,

16:12.406 --> 16:15.409
so, yeah. Yeah, I think
that makes me the expert.

16:15.931 --> 16:16.932
Throw the punch.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.152
-Maybe we
should take a break.
-Throw it.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.731
The rest of us were
the experts
before you got here

16:33.775 --> 16:35.298
and traded your friendship
with Supergirl

16:35.342 --> 16:37.387
for favor
with Director J'onzz.

16:37.431 --> 16:41.087
Oh, if you were in charge,
we'd still be wondering
if Reign was an alien.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.154
You egotistical little son
of a serial killer.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.636
Kara?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.998
Get off me.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.608
Now.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.705
Really, coward?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.142
Have you ever even held
a gun before?

17:37.012 --> 17:38.057
I'm holding one now.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.190
Hey! Hey!

17:42.061 --> 17:43.540
Knock it off!

17:43.584 --> 17:44.889
Knock it off!

17:48.676 --> 17:50.460
I am always cleaning up
your messes.

17:50.504 --> 17:51.679
Get out of my face!

17:56.162 --> 17:58.599
Hey! Hey, break it up!
Come on!

17:58.642 --> 17:59.774
Get off of him.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.527
What the hell just happened?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.485
It was a psychic anomaly.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.313
I put a barrier up
to protect you all.

18:17.357 --> 18:20.882
Oh, God. Winn, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

18:21.187 --> 18:23.537
I'm kind of... I feel like
I'm gonna bleed. Yup.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.802
Demos, man,
I'm so sorry. I'm...

18:28.498 --> 18:30.021
Hey, I'm sorry
for what I said.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.328
For the record,
I think you're super smart.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.764
You're great.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.158
It's like what I saw
the Kalanorian do in the bar.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.029
I told you she needed
more observation.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.510
-Well, it's still
visiting hours.
Let's go see her.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.903
In the meantime,
Agent Schott,

18:41.946 --> 18:43.600
round up the inhibitors
we used against Psi.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.907
Recalibrate them. Make sure
there's enough to go around.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.823
I didn't take enough
precautions last time,
I will now.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.520
Come on.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.915
It's a good thing
you came when you did, man.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.223
Yeah, good thing.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.403
I've never felt anything
like that.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.232
It's like something
was inside of my brain.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.842
I couldn't control it.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.193
-I felt it, too.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.542
Wait a minute,
you were affected?

19:12.586 --> 19:14.283
I hit Mon-El.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.545
Hard.

19:16.851 --> 19:20.202
We... We were training,
and I was frustrated

19:20.246 --> 19:21.856
'cause I wasn't getting it,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.380
and then he brought up
our past,

19:24.424 --> 19:27.122
when I used to train him,
and that's when the rage
set in.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.560
Are you sure
you were affected?

19:30.604 --> 19:32.171
What do you mean?
Of course, I was.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.566
It seems like you two
still have some
unresolved issues.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.090
Maybe it's not a good idea
you train with him.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.049
-That's ridiculous.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.446
No, whatever issues
I had with Mon-El before,

19:46.707 --> 19:48.099
those are behind me.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.232
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.452
This is just about
getting Reign.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.456
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.546
Turn her on her side.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.200
-Okay.
-Prep the Med bay,
we got incoming.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.423
What's she saying?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
I don't know,
but it is definitely Martian.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.087
I just wanna go home,

20:19.305 --> 20:21.089
Lena, please?

20:21.655 --> 20:23.178
Please let me out of here.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.443
I wanna get you home
to your daughter
as much as you do.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.228
Believe me.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.361
I am just trying
to protect you.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.755
Both of you.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.060
I told you this before,

20:36.104 --> 20:38.976
if I had hurt people,
I would remember.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.456
You're right.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.850
You would remember.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.942
On some deep level,
you would feel
what you had done.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.598
When you look at this,
do you remember
what it was like?

20:51.641 --> 20:53.164
Attacking Morgan Edge?

20:54.862 --> 20:56.211
What I wouldn't have given
to have seen that one
up close.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.041
No

21:01.347 --> 21:04.306
Supergirl? I mean, that's
a difficult one to forget.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.222
Having your fist connect
with something so solid,
so powerful.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.530
-This is insane.
-How did it feel
to obliterate?

21:10.573 --> 21:13.184
You tore those men apart.
You ripped the limbs
from their body

21:13.228 --> 21:14.664
and you dragged them
across the beach!

21:14.708 --> 21:16.057
Why are you doing this?

21:16.362 --> 21:17.624
Why?

21:17.667 --> 21:20.148
I just wanna go home
to my daughter!

21:20.191 --> 21:22.890
Like I'd let someone like you
near Ruby.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.330
Living in that house,
day in, day out,

21:28.374 --> 21:29.897
pretending to be her mother?

21:30.593 --> 21:33.074
Watching her sleep,
so vulnerable.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.382
Knowing that any minute
you could rip her apart
with your bare hands.

21:37.513 --> 21:40.342
You're not a mother,
you're a monster.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.170
And I will make sure
you never see Ruby again.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.214
Enough!

22:13.288 --> 22:14.550
J'onn, you knew?

22:14.594 --> 22:16.422
I didn't wanna believe
it was getting worse.

22:19.729 --> 22:23.037
My father has been using
a Martian practice called
Ta'ar Ka'riq

22:23.080 --> 22:26.083
to move his memories and
emotions from the decaying
parts of his mind

22:26.127 --> 22:27.346
to the healthy parts.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.131
But it takes
tremendous amounts of energy.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.830
Sometimes psychic bleeds
can happen.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.180
And the more powerful
the Martian,

22:36.224 --> 22:37.530
the more powerful
the bleed.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.532
Other psychic species,
like Kalanorians,

22:39.575 --> 22:41.272
would be the first
to feel the effects.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.057
When an attack intensifies,

22:43.100 --> 22:44.711
it can affect anyone
in close proximity,

22:44.754 --> 22:46.365
and not just other psychics.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.456
I brought Myr'nn to the DEO
because I

22:50.978 --> 22:54.242
felt I could put a shield
over this place
and keep you all safe, but...

22:57.811 --> 23:00.857
My father's angry about
what's happening to his mind.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.252
And his aggression was being
funneled into all of you.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.299
Can't you help him
with the dampening technology?

23:09.170 --> 23:12.173
He has relied
on his mind his entire life.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.830
First, as a theologian,

23:18.788 --> 23:20.355
and then as a prisoner.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.622
It's what kept him alive
for 300 years.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.408
The White Martians may have
had him locked in a cage,

23:29.451 --> 23:30.757
but he was still free.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.413
This technology
would make him reliant on me.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.201
It would strip him
of the one thing the
White Martians never could.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.421
His independence,
his, um...

23:44.684 --> 23:46.120
His dignity.

23:50.211 --> 23:54.476
I remember sitting
in my kitchen when my mom
got the call

23:54.520 --> 23:58.001
that my grandmother
drove through a traffic light.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.702
By the grace of God,
nobody was hurt.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.402
That was one of the
hardest things
my mom had to do,

24:08.229 --> 24:09.883
taking away her keys.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.669
She told my mom off,
and she cried.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.846
Suddenly she's
in this position she's
never been in before.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.545
She's an adult
being treated like a child.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.852
And it was ugly,
and painful.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.680
But it's what had to be done.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.423
For her protection.
For everyone's protection.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.515
I can face down
the toughest adversaries
without fear,

24:33.559 --> 24:35.778
but talking to my father
about this...

24:42.045 --> 24:44.265
I don't wanna take away
more from him
than he's already lost.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.270
I just got him back.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.707
The practice
of Ta'ar Ka'riq

24:51.751 --> 24:53.927
keeps him as close
to the man I've always known,

24:54.275 --> 24:55.581
and I...

24:57.060 --> 24:58.714
I don't wanna give that up.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.935
My uncle Jor-El used to say,

25:02.457 --> 25:05.939
"The son becomes the father,
and the father the son."

25:24.392 --> 25:25.654
Lena,
why are you doing this?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.743
Just let me go home
to my daughter!

25:27.787 --> 25:30.311
Like I'd ever let someone
like you near Ruby.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.444
How dare you?

25:33.488 --> 25:35.708
How did it feel living
in that house, pretending
to be her mother?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.797
You're not a mother,
you're a monster.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.929
And I'm gonna make sure
you never see Ruby again.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.104
Enough!

25:48.721 --> 25:51.941
Oh, my God! Stop! Stop!
No, make it stop!

25:54.030 --> 25:55.815
I needed you to see it
for yourself.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.648
All those people...

26:05.738 --> 26:07.435
It wasn't your fault.

26:07.478 --> 26:08.610
You weren't in control.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.309
When you transformed,
I was finally able to get

26:12.353 --> 26:13.789
some data on Reign's DNA,
okay?

26:13.833 --> 26:15.661
We have knowledge now,
and knowledge is power.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.445
Hey,

26:17.880 --> 26:19.360
we're gonna get you
through this.

26:21.841 --> 26:22.972
Okay. It's okay.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.858
Footwork looks excellent.

26:39.989 --> 26:40.990
Thanks.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.992
So, you, uh...

26:44.341 --> 26:45.560
You punched me.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.214
Yeah.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.044
Didn't feel like part
of the sparring.
Can we talk about it?

26:51.087 --> 26:52.698
I'm... I'm really sorry.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.526
I think it was
Myr'nn's psychic episode.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.920
Why weren't you affected?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.357
Yeah, the Legion ring
acts as a shield.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.491
-Huh.
-Another perk
from the future.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.322
-Are you sure
that's all it was?
-Yeah.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.367
-No.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.674
'Cause, look, I thought...
I thought we were
in a good place.

27:12.718 --> 27:13.980
But if we need to stop,
we'll just--

27:14.023 --> 27:16.243
No, it's fine. This is...
This is a good thing.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.507
There are Worldkillers
out there, we have...

27:20.073 --> 27:21.291
Let's do this.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.425
I'm ready.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.253
Okay.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.444
Why did you
bring me in here?

27:45.272 --> 27:46.969
Just to talk.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.406
I'd prefer to go back
to my prayer room.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.018
Or, better yet,
take me home.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.455
I'm afraid I can't do that.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.545
As you've been struggling
with your illness,

27:57.588 --> 27:59.678
your psychic waves
have escaped.

28:01.592 --> 28:02.942
It's...
It's affecting people.

28:03.769 --> 28:04.857
No.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.773
I would know if it did.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.949
I've done nothing wrong.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.429
I would never hurt anyone.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.693
No one thinks you're trying
to hurt them, Father.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.914
It happened
with the Kalanorian.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.960
A Kalanorian?

28:21.787 --> 28:23.136
On this planet?

28:24.137 --> 28:25.834
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

28:25.878 --> 28:28.489
-We spoke about it.
-We did no such thing.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.579
-Dad, you're forgetting.
-No!

28:31.622 --> 28:34.016
I will get control of it.

28:34.060 --> 28:38.281
I'm afraid you are not
able to. Not by yourself.

28:38.325 --> 28:44.331
Don't you dare
tell your father what he is
or isn't able to do!

28:47.987 --> 28:50.163
Good. You didn't dip
the shoulder. That's good.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.517
Hey, we survived a black hole,
we can get through
this together.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.910
Come on, try it again.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.394
You just missed the pivot.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.833
-Keep your left foot--

29:08.529 --> 29:11.532
-Please. Please,
Father, just--

29:12.968 --> 29:15.536
They're just in case.
They suppress our powers.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.843
Is that to help me, too?

29:19.192 --> 29:21.368
It's to help
quell your mind, Father.

29:21.847 --> 29:26.112
So that I may assist you
in the practice
of Ta'ar Ka'riq.

29:26.155 --> 29:29.158
You would cage me?

29:33.510 --> 29:34.903
Never.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.384
You're right. We have been
through a lot together.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.778
Like that time when you
promised you wouldn't
leave the DEO,

29:39.821 --> 29:42.128
and instead you ran off,
you got wasted.

29:42.171 --> 29:45.696
You were reckless,
selfish, you lied,

29:45.740 --> 29:47.394
and you didn't apologize.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.699
-Kara, I--
-And then
there was the time

29:48.743 --> 29:50.092
I got you a job a CatCo.

29:50.136 --> 29:53.922
I vouched for you
at my place of employment.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.185
And then you had Eve
do all of your work for you,

29:56.229 --> 29:58.187
and then you screwed her
in the closet.

29:58.231 --> 30:02.104
You didn't apologize for that.
And, shocker,
I apologized to you

30:02.148 --> 30:04.150
for trying to make you
into a better person.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.716
I hear you. I get it.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.849
No, I don't think
you do get it.

30:07.893 --> 30:12.593
I don't think you get that
I gave my heart
to a lying jackass,

30:13.246 --> 30:15.509
who was unaware
of his behavior towards me,

30:15.552 --> 30:17.206
who disrespected me
at every turn,

30:17.250 --> 30:19.556
and now is this reformed
person who, what,

30:19.600 --> 30:21.732
he wants to reminisce
about the good times?

30:21.776 --> 30:23.082
Kara, put this on.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.920
-Winn just finished these.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.751
What did I just do?

30:41.013 --> 30:44.059
For 300 years,
I lived in a cell.

30:44.364 --> 30:48.237
My son will not put me back
in one!

30:49.630 --> 30:50.631
Father.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.335
Containment breach.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.815
Containment breach.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.904
Containment breach.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.080
Containment breech.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.039
Containment breach.

31:07.387 --> 31:08.910
Containment breach.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.433
Myr'nn.

31:38.984 --> 31:39.985
Hey, bud.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.552
Winn Schott!

31:43.075 --> 31:44.424
Pam from HR?

31:45.860 --> 31:47.079
Oh, God. Uh...

31:48.167 --> 31:49.168
Taser.

31:51.866 --> 31:52.998
Oh...

31:54.913 --> 31:56.175
Sorry.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.098
You need to listen to me.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.491
Stay away from me!

32:27.684 --> 32:29.512
No, no, no. Mon-El!

32:59.629 --> 33:02.371
Father, look around you.

33:02.763 --> 33:05.592
You're hurting people.
Your mind is doing this.

33:06.941 --> 33:10.423
No. You are trying
to trick me.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.555
I would never do that.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.254
I love you.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.387
All I want to do
is protect you,

33:19.432 --> 33:23.001
as you have tried
to protect me my entire life.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.092
Trust me, Father.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.446
No! No!

33:35.926 --> 33:37.058
Oh, no.

33:40.322 --> 33:41.454
J'onn?

33:42.281 --> 33:43.456
Stay with him.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.439
Hey, I'm here. You're okay.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.619
I know how hard it is
when everything we know
to be true changes.

34:18.186 --> 34:22.016
But sometimes all we can do
is just accept the way
things are,

34:22.973 --> 34:24.453
and make the best of that.

34:33.419 --> 34:34.681
Oh, God.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.168
J'onn.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.866
The son becomes the father.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.889
Do it.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.089
I know.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.352
I don't want you
to worry about me, okay?

35:39.093 --> 35:41.574
I just have to stay
in the hospital
for a little while.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.753
I miss you, too.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.061
Yeah, the doctors
are saying it's contagious,

35:51.279 --> 35:53.716
so I don't want you
getting sick.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.675
Lena is gonna
check up on you,

35:55.718 --> 35:59.244
and I will be home
as soon as I'm better.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.768
I love you so, so much, baby.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.340
Don't worry about Ruby,
I'll take her to--

36:08.383 --> 36:09.863
Don't tell me where she is.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.127
You keep her away from me
until I'm cured.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.317
May I speak to you all?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.199
I am sorry

36:42.287 --> 36:44.114
for the pain I caused.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.987
I hurt you, all of you.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.730
I was so fearful

36:51.339 --> 36:54.299
of losing control
of what's left of my life,

36:55.169 --> 36:57.780
I refused to accept
what was happening.

37:00.174 --> 37:03.351
And it nearly cost me

37:04.178 --> 37:07.007
everything I hold dear.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.841
I hoped I would've been able
to protect you all better.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.973
You protect us
all the time, J'onn.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.106
Tonight was our turn.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.729
Hey, um, I...

37:33.773 --> 37:36.210
I was gonna leave this here
for you. I didn't think
I'd run into you.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.820
You brought me dinner.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.169
Yeah. Um...

37:40.867 --> 37:43.609
Look, I know your work's
really important.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.786
It's saving-the-world
important, but I happen
to have a few friends

37:47.177 --> 37:48.918
who make a habit of that.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.312
And I know when they
get really deep into it,
they...

37:51.356 --> 37:53.662
They forget to eat, so...

37:54.141 --> 37:55.534
I didn't want that
to happen to you.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.538
Well, that is...

38:01.366 --> 38:03.019
incredibly thoughtful.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.326
And I haven't eaten all day.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.982
Well, I'll leave you
to it, then.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.202
Well, since there's enough
food here to feed an army,

38:13.813 --> 38:15.380
why don't you join me?

38:21.734 --> 38:22.735
Listen, James.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.043
There's something between us,
something good.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.133
But in my life,
in my work,

38:30.177 --> 38:32.701
there are people
who count on my discretion.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.749
So I won't always be able
to share everything with you.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.404
If you think a secret
needs to be kept,

38:40.274 --> 38:41.884
then it needs to be kept.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.410
Well, I appreciate that.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.238
Tell me it's going well,
at least?

38:49.892 --> 38:51.111
Not yet.

38:52.112 --> 38:53.287
But it will.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.129
And the student
becomes the master.

39:12.567 --> 39:13.960
Can we talk about yesterday?

39:14.830 --> 39:17.442
You were whammied
by the psychic attack.

39:17.485 --> 39:21.315
Yes, that's true, but I...
The things I said...

39:23.665 --> 39:25.972
I thought I had dealt
with my feelings about us.

39:29.323 --> 39:32.805
But when we were
in this episode,

39:33.501 --> 39:35.634
it made me realize that

39:37.157 --> 39:39.072
our relationship
was not perfect.

39:39.681 --> 39:43.468
You know, maybe I...
I knew that deep down.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.731
But especially when
you were gone,

39:45.774 --> 39:49.474
I was so busy missing you
and romanticizing us...

39:52.172 --> 39:53.608
I do feel

39:54.479 --> 39:56.829
a big weight
off my shoulders.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.093
So, in a way, I'm grateful
that it happened.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.835
I'm just really sorry that

40:04.184 --> 40:06.491
it took a Martian attack

40:07.666 --> 40:09.015
to make it come out.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.279
And I'm sorry
it was so brutal.

40:12.888 --> 40:14.455
You know what,
the truth can be brutal.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.548
It's not news to me
that I used to be a jerk.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.204
And I'm... I am sorry.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.295
I'm sorry.

40:28.687 --> 40:29.862
For all of it.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.344
I didn't really grasp
your perspective back then.

40:34.388 --> 40:38.523
Yeah, but still, I shouldn't
have hit you.
I'm sorry for that.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.002
And I'm sorry for...

40:43.702 --> 40:44.703
I'm just sorry.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.531
Can we make an agreement?

40:47.183 --> 40:48.533
Yes.

40:50.230 --> 40:51.492
No more apologies.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.543
Do you wanna go be heroes?

41:31.271 --> 41:32.751
Pestilence.
