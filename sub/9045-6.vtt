00:00.083 --> 00:02.044
Previously on Awkward...

00:02.210 --> 00:04.755
Jenna, you could disappear
and no one would notice.

00:04.921 --> 00:07.716
Everyone one thinks I tried to kill myself.
And there's a lame guy selling t-shirt.

00:07.882 --> 00:10.344
- I don't think you tried to kill yourself.
- Jenna, I like you.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.055
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to be in a relationship.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.049
It was Saturday,
but instead of kicking back

00:20.174 --> 00:22.217
my mother was forcing me
to attend a party

00:22.342 --> 00:24.920
Thrown by the elite
mother/daughter charity league,

00:25.045 --> 00:27.156
known as the knick-knackers.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.658
Unfortunately, three spots were open,

00:29.783 --> 00:32.327
and I was sick at the thought
of actually landing one.

00:32.452 --> 00:33.762
'Cause the knick-knackers

00:33.887 --> 00:35.564
weren't obsessed
with helping the homeless.

00:35.689 --> 00:38.434
They were obsessed with plastic.

00:38.559 --> 00:41.208
Plastic was the power currency
of palos verdes,

00:41.374 --> 00:43.706
In the skin and in the wallet.

00:43.831 --> 00:45.374
To be a certified p. V. Mom

00:45.499 --> 00:46.942
meant you had to rock
a bodacious body

00:47.067 --> 00:48.644
and a black amex,

00:48.769 --> 00:50.634
neither of which
were earned by a day job.

00:52.538 --> 00:54.763
To a p. V. Mom,
"working" meant working out

00:55.242 --> 00:56.585
or working a room

00:56.710 --> 00:58.187
or being a knick-knacker.

00:58.312 --> 01:00.122
And my mom was gonna
stay up in my grill

01:00.247 --> 01:01.490
until she became one.

01:01.615 --> 01:04.355
Sweetie, please try and
make a good impression.

01:04.818 --> 01:06.566
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

01:07.054 --> 01:08.330
Did we miss anything?

01:08.455 --> 01:10.566
Tamara was positively
paranoid getting ready.

01:10.691 --> 01:12.101
'Cause you hijacked my fave footies.

01:12.226 --> 01:13.699
Mom, I did you a solid.

01:14.127 --> 01:15.838
You can't wear sandals with
a tweaked toe stitch.

01:15.963 --> 01:17.406
Do these wedges look cheapsky?

01:17.531 --> 01:19.454
No, not at all.
No, they look very chic.

01:19.933 --> 01:21.343
Love you.

01:21.468 --> 01:23.291
Okay, now it's time to divide...

01:23.704 --> 01:25.637
And conquer.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.172
Where is your name tag?

01:29.610 --> 01:30.986
I'm trying to keep a low pro.

01:31.111 --> 01:33.822
Heed off any embarrassment for you.

01:33.947 --> 01:35.679
Too late.

01:36.149 --> 01:37.426
As always, I was powerless

01:37.551 --> 01:39.228
to my mother's subtle persuasion.

01:39.353 --> 01:42.097
I was also strangely
powerless to the feeling

01:42.222 --> 01:45.689
that the house belonged to
someone emotionay disturbed.

01:46.059 --> 01:49.151
Or worse, evil incarnate.

01:52.198 --> 01:53.575
Mo to the fo.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.241
I was in sadie saxton's house.

01:57.742 --> 02:02.038
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Tof</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:02.441 --> 02:04.253
You know this is a charity league,

02:04.378 --> 02:05.921
not a charity, right?

02:06.046 --> 02:07.422
Can I get a name tag?

02:07.547 --> 02:09.091
When you cut your name
across your wrist,

02:09.216 --> 02:10.626
is it with one "n" or two?

02:10.751 --> 02:13.008
Ha. Two.

02:15.421 --> 02:17.622
You're welcome.

02:20.393 --> 02:22.059
Whoa there.

02:22.496 --> 02:24.394
Hi, I didn't expect to see you here.

02:24.798 --> 02:27.209
Just a little part-time gig.

02:27.334 --> 02:29.611
Sadie hooked me up.
So what's going on?

02:29.736 --> 02:31.013
You wanna be a knick-knacker?

02:31.138 --> 02:32.247
No, I do not.

02:32.372 --> 02:33.348
My mother does.

02:33.473 --> 02:34.683
I'm here under duress.

02:34.808 --> 02:36.281
Well, you look nice.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.020
- I do?
- Yeah.

02:38.145 --> 02:40.055
Thank you.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.290
So did you get my text?

02:41.415 --> 02:43.205
About hanging out tonight, yes.

02:43.550 --> 02:46.166
But I...
Better get back to work.

02:48.154 --> 02:49.669
Is McKibben schlocking cocktails?

02:50.157 --> 02:51.400
Yes, we just talked.

02:51.525 --> 02:52.568
But he seemed a little distant.

02:52.693 --> 02:53.735
Do I look like a howker?

02:53.860 --> 02:55.771
My mom made me wear mascara.

02:55.896 --> 02:57.873
Or do you think matty knows
jake kissed me?

02:57.998 --> 02:59.408
No way.
Guys don't talk.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.310
Plus, you said it was an accident.

03:01.435 --> 03:03.412
I'd say the freak-a-deak
was in response

03:03.537 --> 03:06.515
To your name tag.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.516
Bitch.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.988
You have to be cruel to be kind.

03:13.113 --> 03:14.790
Why does that expression
sound so familiar?

03:14.915 --> 03:16.425
It's number seven on the letter.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.073
You have to be cruel to be kind.

03:18.518 --> 03:20.575
Both: Sadie wrote the letter!

03:21.021 --> 03:23.098
Welcome, ladies.

03:23.223 --> 03:24.833
I am Darlene Saxton,

03:24.958 --> 03:27.002
President of the knick-knackers,

03:27.127 --> 03:31.607
and this is my beautiful
and dedicated daughter sadie.

03:31.732 --> 03:32.975
Beautiful?
Questionable.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.077
Dedicated?
Not a question.

03:35.202 --> 03:37.592
Sadie was dedicated
to making my life hell.

03:38.038 --> 03:39.386
After today's orientation,

03:39.840 --> 03:44.099
A few of you will be invited
to join a chapter event,

03:44.644 --> 03:47.894
and from there three of you
will be initiated.

03:48.382 --> 03:50.438
Okay, go.
Pretend to fit in.

03:52.284 --> 03:54.192
What do you think?

03:54.621 --> 03:56.265
It was the mother of my enemy.

03:56.390 --> 03:57.821
I like it.
Is it gessick?

03:58.258 --> 03:59.781
You have a good eye.

04:00.227 --> 04:02.471
My husband, he thinks
it's pretentious vandalism.

04:02.596 --> 04:05.662
But really, it's my husband
who's pretentious.

04:06.066 --> 04:07.476
Darlene seemed cool.

04:07.601 --> 04:08.874
Maybe sadie was adopted.

04:09.302 --> 04:10.512
I just bought another piece.

04:10.758 --> 04:12.627
Come.

04:19.178 --> 04:22.457
Your home is spectacular.

04:22.582 --> 04:24.059
I know.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.061
But it'll need a serious scrubbing

04:26.186 --> 04:27.296
after all the trash leaves.

04:27.421 --> 04:28.664
It must be frustrating

04:28.789 --> 04:30.766
putting on a show
with girls you don't like.

04:30.891 --> 04:32.480
I don't.
I tell it like I see it.

04:32.893 --> 04:34.482
And as I see it, there's a girl here

04:34.928 --> 04:36.401
Who should be shot.

04:39.231 --> 04:41.364
{CUT}Your hair has so much shine.

04:41.835 --> 04:43.045
Thank you, it's natural.

04:43.532 --> 04:45.580
I wish my daughter had that shine.

04:45.705 --> 04:47.162
Do you know jenna?

04:47.641 --> 04:50.332
Only by reputation.

04:50.811 --> 04:53.210
She seems very special.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.725
Oh, especially when
she does her hair.

04:56.850 --> 05:00.258
So why is she... never mind.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.663
No, you can ask me anything.

05:01.788 --> 05:04.763
Is she mentally ill?

05:05.158 --> 05:07.807
Honey, can you fix my friend
up with a drink please?

05:08.261 --> 05:09.237
Excuse me.

05:09.362 --> 05:10.405
Ah, sabrina.

05:10.530 --> 05:11.673
What do you want?

05:11.798 --> 05:13.442
I wanted to hang out with him.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.357
- Ginger ale?
- Any ginger ale down there?

05:15.836 --> 05:18.347
I hadn't seen jake
since he'd impulsively

05:18.472 --> 05:20.362
shoved his tongue down my throat.

05:20.841 --> 05:21.950
And by the look of him,

05:22.204 --> 05:24.219
you'd have thought
I never gave it back.

05:24.344 --> 05:27.744
Babe.

05:33.419 --> 05:35.168
Anyway, babe, make sure you grab

05:35.334 --> 05:37.003
a bottle of schnapps for later,'kay?

05:37.524 --> 05:40.015
Ily!

05:40.260 --> 05:42.634
Dude.
What's going on?

05:43.130 --> 05:44.806
Miss montgomery feel you up too?

05:44.931 --> 05:47.514
Okay, look, here's the deal.

05:48.034 --> 05:49.044
Okay, but you gotta promise

05:49.169 --> 05:50.278
You're not gonna tell anybody, okay?

05:50.403 --> 05:51.513
Yeah, put away your titties
and tell me.

05:51.638 --> 05:53.115
I kissed jenna hamilton.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.283
- What?
- Just...

05:55.408 --> 05:56.618
What are you doing?

05:56.743 --> 06:00.756
Snooping.
I found satan's room.

06:00.881 --> 06:02.320
Oh, we should not be in here.

06:02.716 --> 06:03.892
Of course we should.

06:04.017 --> 06:06.962
The cow has perpetually
tried sabotaging your life.

06:07.087 --> 06:10.161
Time to sabotage hers.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.733
What are you doing?

06:11.858 --> 06:13.635
- I'm gonna pee on her bed.
- You can't.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.334
You're right.
It'll leave dna.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.591
She has straight a's?

06:24.225 --> 06:25.313
Made sense.

06:25.438 --> 06:27.229
To be a raging bitch,
sadie had to be clever.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.764
And to be clever,
she had to be smart.

06:32.044 --> 06:33.393
Of course.

06:33.847 --> 06:35.624
She rides horses.

06:35.749 --> 06:39.024
Dude, how big is that horse?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.396
O.M.G.

06:41.521 --> 06:42.898
I found the mother lode.

06:43.023 --> 06:44.821
That's not cool.
That's her diary.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.160
What a you doing in here?

06:50.751 --> 06:51.661
Adjusting.

06:52.098 --> 06:53.775
Jenna sat on a votive,
so we had to hide the hole.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.957
All done.
No more ass crack.

06:59.138 --> 07:00.378
Okay!

07:02.141 --> 07:03.351
The diary was seductive,

07:03.476 --> 07:05.554
And yet reading it just didn't...

07:05.679 --> 07:07.622
- Ahh!
- Sit right.

07:07.747 --> 07:09.846
I think our chances are strong.

07:10.183 --> 07:12.390
Did you see how much darlene
took a liking to you?

07:12.752 --> 07:14.296
We are all but in.

07:14.421 --> 07:16.264
Are you sure this is a good idea?

07:16.389 --> 07:18.166
We can volunteer on our own.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.736
Yeah, but then what's in it for us?

07:21.861 --> 07:24.152
Sweetie, are you
feeling too much pressure?

07:24.531 --> 07:26.738
Mrs. Saxton's daughter mentioned...

07:27.167 --> 07:28.443
Sadie.
What did sadie mention?

07:28.568 --> 07:31.034
She said you were acting
a little strange at school.

07:31.371 --> 07:32.494
Are you feeling okay?

07:32.839 --> 07:34.954
- She seemed really worried.
- I'm sure she is.

07:35.242 --> 07:36.623
But there's nothing
to worry about, mom.

07:36.910 --> 07:38.958
We are gonna rock the knick-knackers.

07:39.246 --> 07:40.835
We are!

07:41.147 --> 07:44.756
Now I am gonna go rock dinner.

07:46.952 --> 07:48.163
Enough was enough.

07:48.288 --> 07:49.498
I was tired of being powerless

07:49.623 --> 07:51.554
to sadie's sinister savagery.

07:51.925 --> 07:54.891
It was time for me to employ
my own mean girl ammunition.

07:55.262 --> 07:56.442
But it turns out,

07:56.567 --> 07:58.206
I didn't just have sadie's diary.

07:58.331 --> 07:59.908
I had her food journal.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.177
And the one thing sadie
would never want to get out,

08:02.302 --> 08:03.366
her weight.

08:05.475 --> 08:06.686
{pub}It's her food diary?

08:06.811 --> 08:08.121
And a log of her weight.

08:08.246 --> 08:09.689
She's actually making
a lot of strides.

08:09.814 --> 08:11.416
I gotta see it.
Where is it?

08:11.682 --> 08:13.284
At home.
I couldn't risk losing it.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.061
I mean, now that I have
the upper hand,

08:15.186 --> 08:17.205
I need to figure out how to play it.

08:17.588 --> 08:19.833
You play your hand by letting
her know you have a hand.

08:20.224 --> 08:21.467
Then you hold it over her head

08:21.592 --> 08:22.835
so she'll leave you alone.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.203
So I just walk up to her and say,

08:24.328 --> 08:25.671
"hey, sadie,
I have your food journal.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.106
And yeah, I stole it."

08:27.231 --> 08:28.374
That'll go over well.

08:28.499 --> 08:30.101
Think about the little people.

08:30.368 --> 08:31.744
She's not just ruining your life.

08:31.869 --> 08:34.013
She's ruining everyone's.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.448
You suck at being anorexic.

08:36.573 --> 08:39.118
Time to embrace bulimia.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.453
You're welcome.

08:40.578 --> 08:42.738
If you just admit
your parents are cousins,

08:42.863 --> 08:46.575
people will stop making fun
of your learning disability.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.827
You're welcome.

08:47.952 --> 08:49.128
Be <i>muy excelent</i>

08:49.253 --> 08:50.863
at gardening or busing tables,

08:50.988 --> 08:53.733
And maybe you'll get
to stay in this country.

08:53.858 --> 08:54.784
<i>De nada.</i>

08:55.092 --> 08:56.828
J, this is your chance to be a hero.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.164
You have all the power.

08:59.463 --> 09:01.908
Yeah, but with power
comes responsibility.

09:02.033 --> 09:03.376
I have to be strategic.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.411
What I need is a plan.

09:05.536 --> 09:06.963
And a mature perspective.

09:07.238 --> 09:08.714
Something eating you up?

09:08.839 --> 09:10.316
Actually, yes, there's this girl,

09:10.441 --> 09:11.551
this very mean girl,

09:11.842 --> 09:13.219
who's been out to get me,

09:13.519 --> 09:15.221
and recently I came into possession

09:15.346 --> 09:17.557
of something
that could bring her down.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.959
But I'm not ready to resort
to fighting fire with fire,

09:20.084 --> 09:21.761
and yet I'm not really sure
talking things out

09:21.886 --> 09:24.297
Is a good idea.

09:24.422 --> 09:26.098
You did the right thing
by coming to me.

09:26.223 --> 09:27.500
Who is this problem child?

09:27.625 --> 09:28.902
Sadie saxton.

09:29.293 --> 09:31.905
Oh, my.

09:32.229 --> 09:34.340
Oh, my, oh, my,
oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.367
And you're not comfortable
with blackmail?

09:38.535 --> 09:40.012
{CUT}Ugh, I can see
why you're in a pickle.

09:40.137 --> 09:42.749
You and I both know how
manipulative sadie can be,

09:43.040 --> 09:44.250
and I bet that makes you angry.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.685
You probably want to fight her.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.920
Yeah, no, it makes me angry,

09:48.045 --> 09:49.121
but I don't...

09:49.246 --> 09:50.590
But she is bigger than you,

09:50.715 --> 09:52.858
she is stronger than you,
and she's a whole lot meaner.

09:52.983 --> 09:56.796
So if you're gonna fight her,
you have to fight dirty.

09:56.921 --> 09:58.664
Pull her hair, scratch her eyes out,

09:58.789 --> 09:59.932
punch her in those big old fun bags.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.033
Boom, boom.

10:01.158 --> 10:02.702
You're encouraging me to fight her?

10:02.827 --> 10:04.036
Of course not.

10:04.161 --> 10:07.190
I am a professional.

10:10.334 --> 10:13.696
Are you sure there isn't
another solution?

10:14.004 --> 10:15.348
Can't you do something?

10:15.473 --> 10:17.183
Uh, see, that's a tricky sitch.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.185
On the one hand sadie has
hurt a lot of people,

10:19.310 --> 10:20.853
but on the other she could hurt me.

10:21.328 --> 10:23.222
See how that's
a conflict of interest?

10:28.084 --> 10:30.429
So you never told me what
you're gonna do about jenna.

10:30.554 --> 10:32.298
- There's nothing to do.
- Not into her?

10:32.556 --> 10:35.510
It was just an impulsive
kiss, man, come on.

10:35.826 --> 10:37.762
A real kiss or like a peck?

10:38.095 --> 10:39.071
I can't remember.

10:39.196 --> 10:42.016
Probably means it wasn't very good.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.060
Who started it, you or her?

10:44.335 --> 10:46.354
- What does it matter?
- It doesn't.

10:46.637 --> 10:47.847
Just trying to help you
sort things out,

10:47.972 --> 10:49.023
considering you have
a girlfriend and all.

10:49.306 --> 10:50.817
Why do you care so much?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.351
I don't.

10:52.476 --> 10:55.221
I'm just trying to help you, asshole.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.790
So you think I should
say something to jenna?

10:57.915 --> 10:59.692
No!

10:59.817 --> 11:01.494
No, just let it go.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.163
Yeah, she's probably
not thinking about it.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.898
Or you.

11:08.359 --> 11:09.302
Right?

11:09.427 --> 11:10.503
You're right.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.372
They're just terrible
and elitist snobs.

11:13.497 --> 11:16.175
And named after crap
that clutters up your house.

11:16.534 --> 11:19.019
See, now you don't have
to clutter up your calendar

11:19.144 --> 11:21.447
with all of their b. S.
Charity events.

11:21.572 --> 11:23.916
For shiz.
We're better than them.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.251
Pfft, we are.

11:25.376 --> 11:27.353
Now you're gonna go home

11:27.853 --> 11:30.479
and you're not gonna
let them see you sweat.

11:33.650 --> 11:36.029
Mom, I am so sorry we didn't get in.

11:36.353 --> 11:37.997
That totally blows.

11:38.122 --> 11:39.866
It does.

11:40.191 --> 11:41.492
But not for us!

11:41.826 --> 11:44.837
We made it to the next round!

11:44.962 --> 11:46.706
I just didn't want to say
anything in front of tam

11:46.831 --> 11:48.458
because she was feeling so bad.

11:48.732 --> 11:49.675
Aren't you excited?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.586
I am on the inside.

11:51.869 --> 11:55.348
Oh, sweetie, don't worry
about not having tamara around.

11:55.473 --> 11:57.583
This is gonna be a great opportunity

11:57.708 --> 11:59.385
For you to meet new friends.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.596
Oh, like that sweet, sweet sadie.

12:02.246 --> 12:05.350
Don't even think about
crossing me, consuela.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.893
'cause the last housekeeper
that ratted me out

12:08.018 --> 12:09.687
was conveniently "deportate."

12:12.021 --> 12:14.423
Sadie!

12:17.962 --> 12:18.988
Don't come in.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.325
I said don't come in!

12:22.633 --> 12:24.910
I don't need a lecture right now.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.963
Well, you won't have
the life you want

12:27.204 --> 12:28.848
If you keep up these bad habits.

12:28.973 --> 12:30.950
You could have scored
any man you wanted.

12:31.075 --> 12:33.211
Why did you have to pick
a man with a fat gene?

12:33.511 --> 12:36.339
He wasn't fat when we got married.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.341
Well, thanks to you and
your lack of due diligen,

12:38.582 --> 12:40.259
I'm gonna die alone
because you fell in love

12:40.384 --> 12:42.136
With a man
with strong recessive chub.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.097
You won't die alone.

12:44.355 --> 12:45.664
Right.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.633
I forgot about patty,
my lesbian lover

12:47.758 --> 12:51.521
who'd rather eat pizza than have sex.

12:51.762 --> 12:55.174
You don't understand

12:55.299 --> 12:58.043
what it's like to be surrounded

12:58.168 --> 13:01.147
by all of the girls
who can eat everything

13:01.697 --> 13:04.617
and do everything,
and they're perfect.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.161
Oh, pumpkin.

13:07.444 --> 13:08.754
They never have to think twice

13:08.879 --> 13:11.524
about calories or how they'll look

13:11.649 --> 13:14.001
in their plus-size party dresses,

13:14.285 --> 13:16.195
which are really hard
to find by the way

13:16.320 --> 13:18.164
because the only stores
that sell sexy dresses

13:18.289 --> 13:19.765
in my size are chola stores,

13:19.890 --> 13:20.808
And I'm not a hoochie,

13:21.091 --> 13:23.358
and I don't wear tangerine well.

13:25.862 --> 13:29.575
I just want to wake up

13:29.700 --> 13:33.271
and wear whatever I feel like wearing

13:33.537 --> 13:35.731
'cause it all fits

13:35.973 --> 13:38.484
And looks good.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.921
But instead I'm powerless
to the sausages

13:42.046 --> 13:43.239
that double as my arms

13:43.480 --> 13:47.034
and the jenny craig
that lives inside my head.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.830
You have no idea how hard
I'm trying, mom.

13:51.088 --> 13:53.291
I'm really trying.

13:53.524 --> 13:55.793
Honey, I know you are.

13:56.026 --> 13:58.838
And you will be successful

13:58.963 --> 14:01.396
If you track what you eat.

14:04.226 --> 14:07.263
Are you still writing it all down?

14:07.538 --> 14:09.724
Good.

14:13.843 --> 14:16.956
Honey, you know who might be
a good person to talk to?

14:17.081 --> 14:18.274
Jenna hamilton.

14:18.549 --> 14:21.444
She has a darling figure.

14:28.124 --> 14:29.202
Don't tell anyone.

14:29.460 --> 14:30.995
So it's a knick-knacker secret?

14:31.161 --> 14:33.906
Tell clarissa that the next
event is actually formal

14:34.031 --> 14:36.125
even though it doesn't
say it on the invite.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.310
All in-the-know mothers and daughters

14:38.435 --> 14:40.963
are gonna be decked out.

14:41.205 --> 14:42.757
Am I in-the-know?

14:43.007 --> 14:46.010
Yes.
I just told you.

14:49.779 --> 14:51.757
{CUT}Suddenly, I knew the way in.

14:51.882 --> 14:55.311
Or I had a way out
if I didn't tell my mother.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.646
But I was a sucker.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.430
Thank god you have the inside track.

14:58.555 --> 15:00.149
Could you imagine
if we were the only ones

15:00.315 --> 15:01.867
to show up wearing jeans?

15:01.992 --> 15:03.402
It would be humiliating.

15:03.568 --> 15:05.304
Yes, which begs the question,

15:05.429 --> 15:06.906
why would you want to be affiliated

15:07.031 --> 15:09.541
with horrible women who want
to humiliate each other?

15:09.666 --> 15:12.244
Because...

15:12.369 --> 15:13.955
Being a knick-knacker means that

15:14.271 --> 15:16.882
I won't just be that girl who
got knocked up in high school

15:17.007 --> 15:19.485
or that girl who didn't go to college

15:19.610 --> 15:21.504
and make something of herself.

15:21.762 --> 15:23.289
If we get in,

15:23.414 --> 15:24.823
I will finally be the person

15:24.948 --> 15:26.467
that I've always wanted to be.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.553
You'll be a knick-knacker.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.096
And I'll be in.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.348
Apparently mean girls don't grow up.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.599
They just get older.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.476
Mom, you can still go to college.

15:35.642 --> 15:37.069
Yeah, but what's the point?

15:37.194 --> 15:38.896
I'm too old to pledge a sorority.

15:39.154 --> 15:41.106
I know exactly what I'm gonna wear!

15:41.231 --> 15:44.110
It's dressy without being too fancy.

15:45.368 --> 15:46.279
Okay.

15:51.974 --> 15:54.643
I am going to kill you.

15:56.881 --> 15:58.291
{pub}I cannot believe you purposefully

15:58.527 --> 15:59.292
sabotaged us.

15:59.517 --> 16:00.751
- Hi.
- I didn't.

16:00.917 --> 16:03.045
I swear, I heard sadie say
it was a formal event.

16:03.211 --> 16:04.714
I thought she told you.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.882
Well, we're not really
on speaking terms.

16:07.048 --> 16:08.968
- She sorta hates me.
- Now I get it.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.387
You made me look like an idiot

16:11.553 --> 16:13.222
so you could turn your nose up to her

16:13.388 --> 16:14.573
and this entire organization

16:14.698 --> 16:16.142
that you never really wanted to join.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.685
Just selfish.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.079
Oh, god, great!

16:20.204 --> 16:23.691
Now I've ruined my dress.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.986
Way to be sensitive to the cause.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.614
Sadie had set me up.

16:29.780 --> 16:33.192
And I was finally prepared
to exact revenge.

16:33.317 --> 16:35.536
Or was I?

16:35.702 --> 16:38.247
Sadie didn't just hate me.
She hated herself.

16:38.413 --> 16:40.333
She was as powerless
to the stigma of her weight

16:40.458 --> 16:42.735
as I was to the stigma
of my fake suicide.

16:42.860 --> 16:46.339
Was it possible that we
had something in common?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.640
Fuck that.

16:47.765 --> 16:49.258
I had to take the bitch down.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.346
How does it feel
to mock the homeless?

16:53.471 --> 16:54.889
Heartless much?

16:58.107 --> 17:00.603
T, you know what
I've been craving lately?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.655
Fluffernutters.

17:02.924 --> 17:05.790
I have a real weakness for them.

17:05.915 --> 17:08.928
You oozing...

17:09.053 --> 17:10.613
Skitch.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.240
Give me my journal back

17:13.477 --> 17:16.285
or I will make your life miserable.

17:16.451 --> 17:17.522
Well, you kind of already do that,

17:17.761 --> 17:19.163
so how'bout making
my life a little better?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.874
How'bout ensuring I get
a bid for the knick-knackers?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.960
How'bout you go fuck yourself?

17:25.126 --> 17:26.921
- Give it back.
- How do you want it?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.256
Posted all over the walls
or over the web?

17:29.422 --> 17:31.384
We could make her a copy of it.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.178
That's a great idea,
but why not share the wealth?

17:34.456 --> 17:36.514
You wouldn't dare.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.141
You have to be cruel to be kind.

17:39.307 --> 17:40.559
You're welcome.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:49.894 --> 17:51.737
Let's welcome our new knick-knackers.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.739
I had sealed the deal for my mom.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.492
So it was time
to seal one for myself.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.369
One more thing.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.413
Why did you write me
that evil letter?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.814
What letter?

18:01.939 --> 18:03.416
You know, the one
you were too cowardly

18:03.541 --> 18:04.792
To sign your name to.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.585
If I wrote you an evil letter,

18:06.710 --> 18:09.255
you better believe I'd sign my name.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.382
She was telling the truth.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.968
But if sadie didn't
write the letter, who did?

18:14.134 --> 18:15.678
How do I know you didn't make a copy?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.805
You don't.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.390
Guess you're just gonna
have to trust me.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.967
Where sadie's power
was about being cruel,

18:22.092 --> 18:25.187
I decided mine was about being kind.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.166
{pub}Looks like you're in
the clear with hamilton.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.101
Good thing you didn't
make a big deal out of it.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.704
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

18:43.829 --> 18:45.939
You know, like if I woulda
said something,

18:46.064 --> 18:47.793
it might encourage her, you know?

18:47.959 --> 18:50.588
Yeah.
Yeah, not a good idea.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.912
You know, but then
talking it out with you

18:52.037 --> 18:56.177
made me realize
I might be kind of into her.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.388
And maybe it would be good
to talk it out

18:59.554 --> 19:02.183
so something like that kiss
doesn't happen again.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.352
I'm saving you, dude.
Trust me.

19:05.518 --> 19:08.428
Jenna, she has low self-esteem,

19:08.553 --> 19:09.630
which is a strong marker

19:09.755 --> 19:11.365
She will follow
in her mother's footsteps

19:11.490 --> 19:14.168
and get pregnant at 17.

19:14.293 --> 19:15.802
Sadie made a good point.

19:15.927 --> 19:17.938
She said as a charity organization,

19:18.063 --> 19:22.536
we should have
at least one charity case.

19:22.702 --> 19:23.911
No, it's bugging me.

19:24.036 --> 19:25.873
I'm gonna text jenna,
see if she wants to talk.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.833
What if she doesn't text you back?

19:27.999 --> 19:30.461
She's gonna have all the power.

19:30.627 --> 19:33.506
What?
This isn't junior high.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.297
Excuse us.
I'm not feeling well.

19:43.422 --> 19:46.644
I've come to my senses.
We don't belong here.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.371
Ah, she wants me to call her.

20:17.154 --> 20:18.133
Oh, god.

20:18.299 --> 20:20.434
Power was a zero-sum game.

20:20.559 --> 20:22.102
When you allow someone to take it,

20:22.227 --> 20:23.503
they will.

20:23.628 --> 20:25.772
Matty had all the power
in our relationship

20:25.897 --> 20:27.017
because I let him.

20:27.632 --> 20:30.143
But that was about to change.

20:30.268 --> 20:33.770
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go.

20:34.305 --> 20:40.748
