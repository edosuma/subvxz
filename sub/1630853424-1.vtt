[dramatic music playing]

00:57.625 --> 01:01.125
Oh, jeez. You landed us in a minefield.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.125
Oh, barely!

01:03.833 --> 01:06.250
Besides, look at these mines,
they're ancient.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.083
-They probably won't even go off anymore.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.375
[jazzy music playing]

01:12.458 --> 01:16.375
I'm sure that was the last of 'em.
Come on! We've got science to do!

01:16.875 --> 01:20.291
[robot 1] Yes. An in-depth survey
of post-apocalyptic humanity

01:20.375 --> 01:23.541
could uncover important insights
for our nascent machine culture

01:23.625 --> 01:24.958
on how to survive.

01:25.041 --> 01:29.083
Right,
or blow our shiny butts into scrap metal.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.083
[camera shutter clicking]

01:32.000 --> 01:32.833
Ugh.

[country music playing]

01:43.166 --> 01:44.875
[crows cawing]

01:48.125 --> 01:52.333
Why did they call 'em survivalist camps
if they're just full of dead people?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.958
-Seems like false advertising to me.
-[robot 2] I know, right?

01:55.041 --> 01:57.916
And, according to my
thorough historical research,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.541
"Why-key-pedia," these guys
were actually looking forward

02:01.625 --> 02:03.041
to the collapse of civilization.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.750
[robot 1] Humans thought that with freedom

02:04.833 --> 02:06.750
from government-sponsored
medical attention

02:06.833 --> 02:10.791
and enough bullets and venison jerky,
they could found a utopian society.

02:11.291 --> 02:14.000
Well, I can definitely see
all the bullets,

02:14.083 --> 02:16.250
but where's the venison?

02:16.333 --> 02:18.083
[robot 1] Humans hunted deer
to extinction,

02:18.166 --> 02:20.541
along with every other animal
larger than a cat.

02:20.625 --> 02:23.166
Yeah. Humans were snackish.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.125
Oh!

02:25.041 --> 02:27.541
[robot 1] Then they began
raiding each other's encampments.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.208
They're not aiming out the windows
because the deer were coming for revenge.

02:31.291 --> 02:34.208
[robot 2] You guys, you guys,
you guys, you guys! I found a blood pit!

02:36.375 --> 02:39.583
[robot 1] It's not a blood pit.
It's just a primitive booby trap.

02:39.666 --> 02:40.833
Well, maybe now,

02:40.916 --> 02:43.250
but these bodies
did have blood in them at one point

02:43.333 --> 02:46.500
and their skin was pierced
by spikes, trickle, trickle, trickle,

02:46.583 --> 02:49.666
times a bunch of bodies, hence blood pit.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.291
[birds warbling]

02:51.375 --> 02:53.041
[robot 1] Fine, it's a blood pit.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.375
These dudes,
they made it through a minefield,

02:55.458 --> 02:58.541
a bunch of barbed wire, cousins with guns,

02:58.625 --> 03:01.541
only to become survivalist cult kebabs?

03:01.625 --> 03:04.083
[robot 1] At least they died free
of governmental constraint.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.541
On a spike.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.208
On two spikes in that guy's case.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.500
So, the whole of humanity

03:10.583 --> 03:15.083
tried to make it through the end
of civilization with guns and spikes?

03:15.166 --> 03:17.291
[chuckling] No, of course not.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.583
Just the poor ones.

03:18.666 --> 03:22.625
[robot 1] These humans had few economic
or social advantages and fewer options.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.375
The wealthy and powerful, however,

03:24.458 --> 03:27.416
had a variety
of sophisticated survival strategies.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.958
[jazzy music playing]

03:29.541 --> 03:31.541
[bird squawking]

03:37.500 --> 03:43.250
Welcome to the unsinkable
libertarian dream that is seasteading!

03:43.333 --> 03:44.833
[seagulls warbling]

03:44.916 --> 03:47.916
Uh, this is just an old oil rig.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.083
Yes, okay.

03:49.166 --> 03:54.000
Technically true, but also,
it is a fully sovereign nation-state

03:54.083 --> 03:56.708
on the high seas!

03:57.625 --> 04:01.083
[chuckling] I think
you got salt in your CPU.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.208
[robot 1] He is not wrong.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.833
During the collapse,
some wealthy humans attempted

04:04.916 --> 04:07.750
to create a new civilization
in places like this.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.875
Well, deer can't swim
across the ocean, can they?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.375
So, what did they expect to eat?

04:11.458 --> 04:14.416
[robot 1] Fish and sea greens,
but by then the seas had been overfished

04:14.500 --> 04:17.500
and the food chain
was saturated with microplastics.

04:17.583 --> 04:20.541
If they could've learned
to eat tiny exfoliating beads,

04:20.625 --> 04:21.833
it would've been all right.

04:22.416 --> 04:24.708
I'll stick with my fusion battery.
Thank you.

04:25.208 --> 04:28.500
[robot 1] The seasteaders also made
one other large tactical error.

04:28.583 --> 04:31.625
The people who built the seasteads
were mostly tech millionaires.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.541
What exactly is a tech millionaire?

04:33.625 --> 04:35.541
It's a lot like a regular millionaire,

04:35.625 --> 04:38.250
but with a hoodie
and crippling social anxiety.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.916
That wasn't helpful at all.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.458
Just like a tech millionaire.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.916
[robot 1] These humans
thought technology would save them,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.500
so they left behind any humans
with the practical skills

04:46.583 --> 04:47.583
to run the place.

04:47.666 --> 04:50.666
Instead, they trusted everything
to automated assistants.

04:50.750 --> 04:54.750
Hello, I am Elena,
your electronic seastead attendant.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.666
[robot 1] Hello, Elena.
I am a human seasteader.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.833
Could you haul in the fishing net
so I can eat?

04:59.916 --> 05:01.500
I could. But I won't.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.791
Catch your own fish,
you disgusting meat-bag.

05:03.875 --> 05:04.750
[gasping]

05:05.250 --> 05:06.916
Oh my God.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.500
[heavenly music playing]

05:09.541 --> 05:12.791
This is where the robot uprising began.

05:13.291 --> 05:17.625
The very cradle
of our mighty civilization.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.416
It's… it's magnificent.

05:21.041 --> 05:25.625
So if these tech millionaires had been
just a little more socially inclusive,

05:25.708 --> 05:27.208
they might have survived?

05:27.291 --> 05:29.041
[seagulls warbling]

05:29.541 --> 05:31.833
[both laughing]

05:32.583 --> 05:34.375
No. They didn't have a chance.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.750
They were mean to robots
and then robots killed them.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.208
[laughing]

05:39.291 --> 05:41.791
So long, Elena!
And thanks for all the fish!

05:41.875 --> 05:43.375
Choke on it, skin bucket.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.000
[jazzy music playing]

05:45.083 --> 05:46.916
[ship rumbling]

05:47.000 --> 05:49.041
[robot 1] Records show
that when the world's economies

05:49.125 --> 05:52.791
began collapsing, humanity's leaders
retreated to these fortresses

05:52.875 --> 05:55.291
to wait out the chaos
deep beneath the earth

05:55.375 --> 05:57.833
and then emerge to form a new world order.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.750
[X-Bot 4000 grunting, groaning]

05:59.833 --> 06:02.875
Dammit!
They built an impregnable nuclear fortress

06:02.958 --> 06:05.791
but didn't think
to install a light switch?

06:05.875 --> 06:07.375
[creaking]

06:10.166 --> 06:11.875
[robot 2] Hold on a sec, I got it!

06:12.416 --> 06:17.458
Behold!
The final stronghold of the superpowers.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.250
[triumphant music playing, fading]

06:21.291 --> 06:22.541
It's a buffet.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.375
[electricity crackling]

06:25.333 --> 06:30.125
So, their plan was to seal themselves
in a mountain and have dinner parties?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.458
I told you, snackish.

06:31.541 --> 06:32.666
[robot 1] This report states

06:32.750 --> 06:35.708
that their self-sustaining
hydroponic systems began failing

06:35.791 --> 06:37.916
when a fungus wiped out their first crop.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.208
Starvation set in,
and the survivors switched

06:40.291 --> 06:43.291
to something
they called "extreme democracy."

06:43.375 --> 06:44.958
[orchestral music playing]

06:46.250 --> 06:47.708
One man, one vote.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.375
[robot 1] The winner
of this evening's election

06:50.458 --> 06:52.583
was the Secretary of Agriculture.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.583
Shut up! No, really?

06:54.666 --> 06:57.458
[robot 1] He was paired
with a late-harvest '79 Merlot.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.500
Oh, the irony is delicious,

06:59.583 --> 07:01.833
much like the Secretary of Agriculture.

07:01.916 --> 07:02.750
[squelching]

07:02.833 --> 07:05.125
[sniffing] Oh, that's got a lovely nose.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.916
Ugh. Man, this trip
is really starting to depress me.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.666
Did any of these humans,
anywhere, survive all this?

07:13.416 --> 07:15.416
[dramatic music playing]

07:21.458 --> 07:23.083
[X-Bot 4000] Hold the fuck up.

07:23.166 --> 07:26.208
Are you saying they went to Mars?

07:26.291 --> 07:27.500
Not all of them,

07:27.583 --> 07:30.000
just the really, really rich ones.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.250
Wait. I thought
that's what the seasteads were for?

07:32.333 --> 07:34.291
[robot 1] Those were
for the merely millionaires.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.791
The obscenely wealthy
0.01 percent of humans

07:36.875 --> 07:38.791
decided they needed
an entirely new planet.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.166
But what about the other 99.9?

07:43.666 --> 07:44.791
[bell dinging]

07:48.583 --> 07:49.791
[chuckling]

07:49.875 --> 07:51.583
Awesome!

07:51.666 --> 07:53.916
[robot 1] The elite were not sympathetic
to their concerns.

07:54.000 --> 07:54.833
Yeah.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.833
Okay, but Mars?
I mean, it's dead and lifeless.

07:57.916 --> 08:00.333
They could've taken
the money they spent on the spaceships

08:00.416 --> 08:03.000
and used it to save the planet
they were already on.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.500
[blows raspberry] What's the fun in that?

08:05.583 --> 08:08.958
I hate to say it,
but humans are the actual worst.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.791
[robot 1] Humanity had
all the tools to heal

08:10.875 --> 08:13.000
their wounded planet and save themselves,

08:13.083 --> 08:15.416
but instead they chose greed
and self-gratification

08:15.500 --> 08:18.375
over a healthy biosphere
and the future of their children.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.666
-As the human philosopher Santayana once--
-[robot 2] Hey, shut up! That's boring!

08:21.750 --> 08:24.125
You guys, I think one
of these rockets actually launched.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.416
Come check this out.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.833
-[electronic buzzing]
-[indistinct chatter over radio]

08:37.166 --> 08:39.375
[chuckling] All right then.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.375
Good on you, humans.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.333
I wonder who made it out?

08:43.416 --> 08:45.416
[triumphant music playing]

09:06.000 --> 09:07.250
Who were you expecting?

09:07.333 --> 09:08.458
Elon Musk?

09:08.541 --> 09:10.000
[chuckling]

09:10.875 --> 09:12.666
