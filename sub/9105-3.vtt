WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:09.635
Something happened
to Liam.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.895
Is he being flown out?

00:12.054 --> 00:12.896
It's much worse than that.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.773
<i>We have equipment
which could significantly</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:16.934
<i>improve Liam's chances
of recovery.</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:18.693
You were doing something
you shouldn't have.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.948
<i>You went out to
be with another woman.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:23.948
Listen, Jules...

00:24.107 --> 00:25.734
My God, you were.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.244
She can have you.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.528
Just go.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.618
If the murder team comes over
from the mainland,

00:30.781 --> 00:31.998
they'll be looking at you,
Hildur, won't they?

00:32.156 --> 00:33.283
<i>Charlie wouldn't give you
the glacier.</i>

00:33.450 --> 00:36.420
The Governor is responsible.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.297
Her sheriff killed them both.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.834
<i>DCI Morton is
a forensic expert.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.344
He can provide invaluable
analytical skills.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.505
<i>This is some kind
of ritualistic murder.</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:48.424
<i>What kind of ritualistic murder</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:51.059
would you say involves
a potato peeler?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.516
But until we have
somebody else in custody,

00:53.679 --> 00:54.646
I'm not letting him walk.

00:54.805 --> 00:55.806
It'll create panic.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.817
I think we can rule out
the grieving widow.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.733
Somebody!

01:01.895 --> 01:02.771
Hello?

01:02.938 --> 01:04.485
Natalie should've
been there too!

01:04.647 --> 01:07.697
Natalie Yelburton
could be a victim--

01:07.859 --> 01:12.160
missing, lost, abducted.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.744
Jesus Christ!

01:13.907 --> 01:14.908
<i>I know who did it!</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.372
<i>Pick up, Jason!</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:18.253
For Christ's sake, Jason,

02:24.144 --> 02:27.569
So what do you make
of Fortitude?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.235
Uh... what do I make?

02:31.401 --> 02:35.406
It's a very fine community
with a lot of very nice people.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.414
This is my girlfriend,
Shirley.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.837
Hello, hi.

02:42.996 --> 02:43.792
Gene.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.751
Markus wants
to speak with you

02:46.917 --> 02:48.590
because you're
a detective.

02:48.752 --> 02:49.799
Oh!

02:49.961 --> 02:51.053
I've always been
very interested

02:51.213 --> 02:52.305
in forensic science.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.340
Uh-huh.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.140
I actually teach science
at the school here.

02:57.302 --> 02:57.928
You do?

02:58.095 --> 02:58.937
Mm-hmm.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.063
And chemistry, biology.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.394
Uh-huh.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.853
Physics also.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.063
Markus teaches
all subjects.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.227
I see that.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.317
Up to primary
seven level.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.401
Uh-huh.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.816
Great.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.866
Shall I tell you something
very interesting

03:16.029 --> 03:18.123
about this place?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.373
Sure.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.040
You cannot die here.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.629
Or be buried here.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.294
Those are the laws.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.589
Because anything
that is buried

03:33.755 --> 03:35.257
never decays.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.305
There are bodies
in the cemetery

03:38.468 --> 03:40.186
that still have
plague in them.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.062
Plague?

03:41.221 --> 03:41.938
Mm-hmm.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.144
Wow.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.853
This place

03:45.016 --> 03:47.610
is a forensic
treasure house.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.648
Hmm.

Hey, Celia.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.029
Has something happened to Jason?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.785
Do you know where he is?

05:18.944 --> 05:20.196
No.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.956
He's not here, Dan.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.161
Snowmobile's
not out there.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.701
Hi, Celia.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.210
The girls
in the living room?

05:27.369 --> 05:28.746
Ah, Hanna's there.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.539
I'll talk to her
while you two catch up.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.554
Mind if I sit down?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.436
I'm okay just now.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.563
Well, now I'm not.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.521
Is this about that man
that was murdered?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.607
Why do you say that?

05:52.769 --> 05:55.739
Dan, why else would you
come in here like this?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.400
Do you know where Jason is?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.535
He helps a scientist.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.866
What scientist?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.996
A researcher
up at the Institute.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.247
What's his name?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.247
Dr. Yelburton.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.004
Natalie Yelburton?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.290
Dr. Yelburton's a woman?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.544
<i>Who peels the potatoes?</i>

06:17.711 --> 06:19.554
Sylvie peels
the potatoes.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.761
Does she?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.641
Could you show me
the potato peeler?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.303
It's in the dishwasher.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.221
Would you get it?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.857
I know that Jason
tried to extort money

06:31.016 --> 06:32.939
from Professor Stoddart.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.149
They were seen arguing
in a car park.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.815
Last night, Professor Stoddart
was murdered in his home.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.700
Thank you.

06:48.867 --> 06:49.959
Good job.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.170
Celia, call me
when you hear from him.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.210
I don't believe this,
Dan Anderssen.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.502
Promise me that
you'll call me

06:59.669 --> 07:00.761
the moment that
you hear from him.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.218
You know that Jason
isn't capable

07:02.380 --> 07:04.053
of doing anything like that.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.764
Then I have to speak to him.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.895
Why?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.352
Natalie Yelburton.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.767
She's missing.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.815
If they're together,
I have to speak to them both.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.607
I'll save that
till Jason's home.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.636
Miss?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.923
Can I get the Wi-Fi password
from you, please?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.466
Um, sure.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.806
The code is “midnightsun"
all in one word.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.061
"Midnightsun" in one word.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.186
Where are you from?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.771
Um...

07:55.934 --> 07:57.607
Spain.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.521
Madrid?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.907
Close.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.238
And what are you
running away from?

08:04.401 --> 08:07.325
Everybody here is running away
from something.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.830
I'm not.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.241
You're not?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.499
No.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.083
Can I ask you, um,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.374
is this the hotel that
Bill Pettigrew stayed in?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.542
Who?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.961
The fella who was eaten
by a bear.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.637
I think it is.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.888
You think so?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.300
Did you know him?

08:30.719 --> 08:33.063
To serve him coffee,
like I served you.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.949
Yeah?

08:53.324 --> 08:57.750
I know what
you did to me.

08:59.539 --> 09:04.466
The way you told me
what happened to Charlie.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.301
I never dreamt anyone would do
what you did to me.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.262
And now I know
you had nothing to do

09:09.424 --> 09:11.597
with the death
of your husband.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.479
You owe me.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.574
I would like the keys
to your husband's office

09:26.733 --> 09:29.361
and your formal permission
to enter it

09:29.527 --> 09:31.120
and search it.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.091
Say it.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.758
I'm giving you permission
to go into my husband's office.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.472
And permission to search.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.184
And permission
to search.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.440
Thank you.

10:17.033 --> 10:17.909
Put this on.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.214
Why?

10:23.373 --> 10:24.465
You're coming with me.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.386
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.849
Where are you taking me?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.479
But how could he
have frostbite?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.818
Are they sure
he has frostbite?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.779
Yes, they're sure.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.490
But how could he?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.620
He went outside.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.874
Liam was sick
and he went outside.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.417
Why?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.671
Why would he do that?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.587
Maybe he called out,
but there was no one at home.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.802
Who knows what he wanted
or what he needed?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.262
But his mother
wasn't there.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.148
And I should have been there,
but I was with you.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.171
Satellite telemetry,
herd movements,

11:45.330 --> 11:47.549
tagged individuals...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.709
...stillbirths
and miscarriages.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.720
These are all this season.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.973
Give me the most recent date
and location.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.887
Last radio-tagged individual
was this morning.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.726
Who took the photograph?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.231
Horrific!

12:03.389 --> 12:04.481
"NY."

12:04.641 --> 12:06.234
Natalie Yelburton.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.566
The photograph's geo-tagged.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.482
These are Institute
research cabins?

12:12.649 --> 12:13.901
I think so.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.319
D8 and D11.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.577
D11 is bigger.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.828
It will sleep two people.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.661
D11 is closer.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.248
Read out the coordinates
for D11.

12:24.410 --> 12:29.291
"GPS 805062,"

12:29.457 --> 12:31.175
Why do you think
she's not alone?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.301
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.555
Really?

12:42.679 --> 12:43.771
Who's she with?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.613
Is he a flight risk
or a danger to society?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.320
Don't speak to the suspect.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.234
What I hear from you

12:56.401 --> 12:58.745
is a man who likes the sound
of his own clever voice.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.826
Why do you find my being here
so threatening?

13:00.989 --> 13:02.991
I don't find you
threatening.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.285
Should I find you
threatening?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.703
Are you threatening me?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.086
If I'm a suspect
for what's happened,

13:08.246 --> 13:09.338
it's fucking ridiculous,
don't you agree?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.965
Have you spoken
to a UK lawyer yet?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.216
No.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.376
Have you had
your phone call?

13:13.543 --> 13:14.089
No.

13:14.252 --> 13:14.798
Out of the way.

13:14.961 --> 13:15.803
Call this number.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.054
He can help.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.274
Come here.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.356
Wait here.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.815
Come here.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.527
Come here, do this up.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.862
Keep warm,
don't speak to anyone.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.242
What are you doing?

13:38.401 --> 13:39.744
I don't want him
to suffocate.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.824
What, your rabbit?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.284
No, leave him there for now.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.040
Leave him in here.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.042
You look after him,
don't you?

13:47.201 --> 13:48.373
You wouldn't let anybody
hurt him.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.958
Who's going to hurt him?

13:50.121 --> 13:50.872
Nobody.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.291
That's what I'm saying.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.256
If anybody tried
to take him away from you,

13:55.418 --> 13:57.671
you'd protect him,
wouldn't you?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.166
Move it!

14:27.325 --> 14:28.668
Move it, come on!

14:31.579 --> 14:32.751
Come on!

14:34.290 --> 14:35.416
Come on!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.506
Where are we going?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.295
Dad, what's going on?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.463
We're all right.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.223
Jason's got us
in a bit of trouble.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.433
Come on!

14:47.553 --> 14:48.475
Right, get on.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.560
Are you all right?

15:10.451 --> 15:13.546
Can you tell me
where we're going, please?

15:13.704 --> 15:14.796
Dad?

15:18.376 --> 15:21.380
Eric, take the prisoner
back to the holding cell.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.926
Well, we know where Natalie
and Jason are.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.560
Come on, let's go.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.188
If you have to use this,
aim for the center of the body.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.975
Don't hesitate.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.519
Don't think
about wounding.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.234
You shoot to stop,
just like you would a bear.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.818
If it kills him,

15:39.981 --> 15:42.154
that's his fault for not
stopping when you told him.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.114
I know.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.745
Center of the body.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.908
Hey, Ingrid.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.167
You tell him,

15:52.326 --> 15:53.168
he'll stop.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.125
No shooting necessary.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.961
Jason Donnelly's
smarter than a bear.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.339
We set off
at first light.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.253
If the prick in the stupid coat
turns up

16:02.420 --> 16:04.548
looking to get involved,
I want you to tell him

16:04.714 --> 16:06.466
as politely as possible
to fuck off.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.553
With pleasure.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.814
Excuse me,
does that payphone work?

16:16.976 --> 16:17.898
Yeah.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.615
Not very private
though, is it?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.074
Not many people use it.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.990
Can I ask you, did somebody
make a call from that phone

16:31.157 --> 16:34.286
Friday night
00?

16:34.452 --> 16:37.001
The only man that uses
that phone is Henry Tyson.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.959
He doesn't have
one of them.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.048
He thinks they mess
with your soul.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.099
Hello?

16:48.257 --> 16:49.258
Hold on one second.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.519
I'm just going
to step outside.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.522
Hello?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.809
<i>DCI Morton?</i>

16:57.975 --> 16:59.443
Oh, Vincent.

16:59.602 --> 17:05.905
So how does calling you
help my situation here and now?

17:06.067 --> 17:07.489
Well, if you're honest with me,

17:07.652 --> 17:09.074
if you tell me
the absolute truth,

17:09.237 --> 17:10.829
then I'm the only one out here
who can help you.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.580
Listen to me,
I don't have any reason

17:12.740 --> 17:14.083
to tell anybody
anything but the truth.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.165
<i>I didn't kill
Professor Stoddart.</i>

17:16.327 --> 17:17.453
<i>I found him on the floor.</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:18.963
He was already dead.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.964
How did you get into the house?

17:21.123 --> 17:25.377
<i>I saw him through the window
and I smashed the glass doors</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:27.968
because he wasn't moving.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.677
And he was dead?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.513
I thought he was dead.

17:31.676 --> 17:32.768
I was sure.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.850
Then you called the police?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.605
<i>No, I didn't call anyone.</i>

17:36.764 --> 17:40.018
<i>The police suddenly appeared--
the sheriff, out of nowhere--</i>

17:40.184 --> 17:42.061
and shot the dog.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.401
<i>He handcuffed me
and took me outside.</i>

17:44.564 --> 17:46.316
<i>But he was already
inside the house</i>

17:46.482 --> 17:49.076
<i>when I found
Professor Stoddart.</i>

17:49.235 --> 17:50.657
Dan was already there?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.288
Yes.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.784
Okay, all right, look, Vincent,
I'm going to do everything I can

17:56.951 --> 17:58.669
<i>to get you out of there
as soon as possible.</i>

17:58.828 --> 18:00.205
<i>In the meantime,</i>

18:00.371 --> 18:01.873
keep your chin up.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.417
Keep my chin up?

18:06.836 --> 18:07.928
Hello?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.272
Trish?

18:24.353 --> 18:25.445
Hi.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.367
Have they...

18:32.069 --> 18:33.662
Have they caught anyone?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.038
They are bringing in
a suspect.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.622
Who?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.335
The man Charlie
had the fight with

18:44.498 --> 18:46.546
in the car park.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.926
The miner.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.177
Yeah.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.305
That's good.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.592
How are you doing?

18:53.758 --> 18:57.353
I know this must be
so harrowing for you.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.811
I was okay until I...

19:02.725 --> 19:05.023
...I listened
to Charlie's message.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.188
His message?

19:07.355 --> 19:10.859
The last call
he made to me.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.778
He says he's got
something to show me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.659
He says it's precious.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.300
Trish...

19:30.670 --> 19:31.762
Come here.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.726
Let's get you into bed.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.262
Yeah?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.305
All right?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.691
Trish, come on.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.193
You'll feel much better
in the morning.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.817
No.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.200
No, why?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.327
Please.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.612
No, Alfred.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.122
I'm your friend, please.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.748
I've never let you down,
have I?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.124
Please.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.463
I need that
seaplane, man.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.714
Come on.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.304
Come here,
sit down.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.510
All right.

20:15.673 --> 20:16.765
What it is, right?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.186
Okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:25.942
It costs more to hire a seaplane
to fly us to Norway

20:26.100 --> 20:29.195
than I anticipated,
sweet pea.

20:29.353 --> 20:34.780
So apparently,
I've never heard of inflation.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.615
But never mind.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.575
Plan B.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.830
All right?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.405
<i>Trish, we might
have found something incredible</i>

21:13.564 --> 21:14.486
<i>come out of the ice.</i>

21:14.648 --> 21:16.116
<i>Something ancient.</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:19.370
<i>Something that's going to cause
a hell of a lot of trouble.</i>

21:19.528 --> 21:23.203
<i>To save the message, press two.</i>

21:23.365 --> 21:26.039
<i>To delete the message,
press three.</i>

21:27.328 --> 21:28.500
<i>Message deleted.</i>

21:28.662 --> 21:30.164
<i>Main menu.</i>

21:30.331 --> 21:32.004
<i>To listen to your
saved messages...</i>

21:45.012 --> 21:46.104
You can't come in here.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.515
Pardon?

21:47.681 --> 21:50.400
You can't come in here.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.482
I am in control
of this crime scene.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.773
It is my decision whether
you are allowed in or not.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.658
I have to preserve
the integrity of the...

21:57.817 --> 21:59.990
I'm a policeman,
same as you.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.621
Yes, and I have to preserve
the integrity of the...

22:02.780 --> 22:03.997
And it's Petra, right, isn't it?

22:04.156 --> 22:06.124
Yes.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.409
I'm here because
Professor Stoddart

22:07.576 --> 22:08.998
was a British citizen

22:09.161 --> 22:11.163
and a wicked person
did a terrible thing.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.924
And I want to catch them,
same as you.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.882
I have no other agenda.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.638
This is my job,
and I'm very good at it.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.801
Now, you are in control
of this crime scene,

22:22.967 --> 22:25.641
and I will not question that
for a second.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.726
Not for a second.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.356
However,

22:29.515 --> 22:31.142
I will interpret it for you,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.481
and I promise I will tell you

22:33.644 --> 22:35.396
absolutely everything
that I see.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.574
Promise.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.700
May I come in?

22:42.152 --> 22:45.031
♪♪

23:07.428 --> 23:10.272
I see two Ski-Doos.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.308
Small lights are on inside.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.527
No more.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.318
We have to separate them.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.907
Bring one outside.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.162
It's minus 30.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.666
How are we going to get
anybody outside?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.380
Dan?

23:35.539 --> 23:37.962
Hear that?

23:40.169 --> 23:42.638
Diesel generator.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.227
And it will tell us something
about the professor's state--

23:48.385 --> 23:50.763
whether he was agitated,
nervous, relaxed...

23:50.930 --> 23:53.979
Well, he was preparing dinner
when he was assaulted.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.393
Mm-hmm.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.985
And he was having red wine,
so he was relaxed and busy.

24:04.568 --> 24:08.072
A pulsing blue LED
on the TV.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.707
So he paused the program.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.958
Mm-hmm.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.290
He came down here
to let somebody in.

24:16.497 --> 24:21.173
And he paused the program
when he heard someone.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.509
He walked over there
to let them in.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.051
He paused the program

24:28.217 --> 24:31.061
because he was not
expecting them to stay.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.276
35 hours.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.190
So now we know
what time he was attacked.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.829
<i>No, he knows where.</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:50.331
<i>Harvey knows this town
like a book.</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:52.583
<i>But how will I recognize
your friend?</i>

24:52.741 --> 24:55.369
<i>Oh, you can't miss him,
Mrs. Chumley.</i>

24:55.536 --> 24:56.662
<i>He's a pooka.</i>

24:56.829 --> 24:58.923
<i>A pooka?</i>

24:59.081 --> 25:00.799
<i>Is that something new?</i>

25:00.958 --> 25:04.383
<i>No, as I understand it,
that's something very old.</i>

25:10.092 --> 25:11.639
Jason.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.348
Dan?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.605
Throw the rifle away
from the cabin.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.390
Dan, what...?

25:16.557 --> 25:17.183
Stay there!

25:17.349 --> 25:19.898
Throw the rifle away
from the cabin!

25:20.060 --> 25:21.152
Do it now!

25:26.734 --> 25:28.031
Down on your knees.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.740
Cross your hands
behind your head.

25:29.903 --> 25:30.904
What the fuck's going on?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.414
Dan, what's this all about?

25:32.573 --> 25:33.665
Hey!

25:35.325 --> 25:36.451
Get the fuck...!

25:36.618 --> 25:37.961
Ah!

25:38.120 --> 25:39.963
You fucking bastard!

25:42.041 --> 25:43.167
Hands in the air, Natalie!

25:43.333 --> 25:44.425
Hands in the air!

26:02.811 --> 26:03.858
Hello, Hildur.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.486
Hey, Henry.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.739
You like that one?

26:09.902 --> 26:11.119
Oh, I love it.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.621
I love your work.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.872
Without your work,

26:14.031 --> 26:15.999
this place would just be
a nameless block of ice

26:16.158 --> 26:17.910
in the middle of nowhere,
wouldn't it?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.420
Thank you, Hildur.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.757
Jesus, that's awful.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.044
Sitting upright.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.336
Fucking awful.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.551
Don't do it on my behalf.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.090
I didn't.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.392
Will you join me?

26:39.681 --> 26:42.025
There you are.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.276
Now...

26:45.521 --> 26:47.523
Ready when you are, guv' nor.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.117
Did you, uh...

26:51.276 --> 26:53.904
Did you see Charlie
before he died?

26:56.073 --> 26:57.916
Christ.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.624
Charlie is dead?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.507
Yes, I saw him.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.384
When?

27:07.543 --> 27:09.637
That morning.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.298
What did he say to you?

27:12.464 --> 27:18.813
He wasn't going to let you build
your glacier hotel.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.063
He said that?

27:20.222 --> 27:21.519
That's right.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.934
Why?

27:23.100 --> 27:27.230
Because he'd found something
very, very precious.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.156
Precious.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.244
Like what?

27:34.403 --> 27:35.495
What was it?

27:37.656 --> 27:41.627
Tell me, how much are you
in for, Hildur?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.542
I don't know what you mean.

27:46.665 --> 27:52.172
How much have you already
committed to your glacier hotel?

27:52.337 --> 27:55.432
Too much to back out now?

27:55.591 --> 27:58.060
Have you got in over your head,
as they say?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.095
What had Charlie found?

28:00.262 --> 28:02.560
He wouldn't tell me.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.073
You know, I had no option
but to sign your exile notice.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.364
I don't make the law,
I just administer it.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.998
You can't die here.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.626
It's against the law.

28:22.784 --> 28:27.005
But as governor of the island,
I have discretionary powers.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.589
I can make an exception
if I see compelling reasons.

28:33.128 --> 28:37.053
Over matters of life and death,
you have discretionary powers.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.059
You're a singularly
powerful woman,

28:39.218 --> 28:41.641
Hildur Odegard.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.431
What had Charlie found?

28:44.598 --> 28:46.271
He didn't say.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.855
I don't believe you.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.236
This new policeman.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.618
You think he's going
to sniff you out?

29:00.280 --> 29:04.285
You know, nothing buried
in permafrost ever decays.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.955
Disease doesn't die
in the ground.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.796
You're a toxic old man,
aren't you, Henry?

29:11.959 --> 29:15.088
So you and your cancer
will leave here,

29:15.254 --> 29:18.428
and you'll die
all alone on the mainland.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.217
Mm-hmm.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.011
Say cheese, Hildur.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.263
Bye, Henry.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.081
<i>Charlie said he'd
found something precious.</i>

29:42.239 --> 29:44.913
<i>He wanted to tell me about it.</i>

29:45.075 --> 29:48.750
<i>Said it would change
everything.</i>

29:48.912 --> 29:50.004
<i>I told Hildur.</i>

29:50.163 --> 29:52.837
<i>Then I went to bed.</i>

29:53.000 --> 29:54.593
<i>I couldn't sleep, though.</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:56.799
<i>I went to find the phone</i>

29:56.962 --> 29:58.714
and listen to Charlie...

30:00.882 --> 30:02.680
...Charlie again.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.396
The message had gone.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.940
Gone?

30:12.269 --> 30:13.612
What had he found?

30:13.770 --> 30:14.862
I don't know.

30:16.565 --> 30:20.195
He said he'd have
to rewrite his report.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.454
What report?

30:22.612 --> 30:25.286
Hildur's glacier hotel.

30:25.449 --> 30:28.453
She can't go ahead
without government say-so.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.337
The government is waiting
on Charlie's impact report.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.498
Charlie said in his message

30:33.665 --> 30:36.259
that he'd found something
that changed everything.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.170
Okay.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.467
Let's start with wind chimes
and infidelity.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.385
What about them?

30:45.552 --> 30:50.058
What other illicit
connections should I know about?

31:01.234 --> 31:02.907
What are you doing in here?

31:03.070 --> 31:05.573
I have some information I need
to feed into the interrogation.

31:05.739 --> 31:06.535
Information.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.415
Right.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.496
Yeah.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.784
Fuck off.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.295
I beg your pardon?

31:12.454 --> 31:13.546
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.797
Is it the accent?

31:14.956 --> 31:16.048
It's the accent.

31:16.208 --> 31:21.180
You. Can. Fuck. Right. Off.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.643
All right.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.349
Let me put it to you this way.

31:30.555 --> 31:35.152
Does she know that you
are fucking Trish?

31:41.108 --> 31:43.110
Give that to Dan.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.495
And set up
a video feed for me

31:45.654 --> 31:48.123
so I can watch
this interrogation,

31:48.281 --> 31:50.659
preferably someplace
where I won't be disturbed.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.088
<i>When Stoddart
sought police advice</i>

31:59.251 --> 32:01.094
<i>because someone was trying
to extort money from him,</i>

32:01.253 --> 32:02.675
<i>that wasn't you?</i>

32:02.838 --> 32:05.261
<i>I was attacked.</i>

32:05.424 --> 32:07.267
Assaulted.

32:10.512 --> 32:11.479
Look at that.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.482
<i>He had a hold of me</i>

32:14.641 --> 32:18.271
<i>and that search-and-rescue guy
laid into me.</i>

32:30.073 --> 32:32.542
Jason, can you give us
an account,

32:32.701 --> 32:34.169
with witnesses
if possible,

32:34.327 --> 32:35.579
of your whereabouts
throughout Friday

32:35.745 --> 32:36.837
and into Friday evening?

32:36.997 --> 32:39.921
No, I don't think I can.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.505
Between 7:00 and 7:30.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.796
I was with my brother Ciaran.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.385
In his shop.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.141
Arguing about money.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.678
Bring Ciaran Donnelly in.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.566
<i>Tell us...</i>

33:03.732 --> 33:04.858
...about this.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.785
That.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.289
Okay.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.208
It's been in a box in a cupboard
in our house for years.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.667
It's an elephant's tooth.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.334
Why are you
carrying it around?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.344
Just found it.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.504
Shoved it in my pocket.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.637
No reason.

33:33.762 --> 33:37.187
<i>This was found in
Stoddart's bedroom.</i>

33:44.105 --> 33:45.322
What is this?

33:45.482 --> 33:49.032
It's a diagram
of a mammoth's jaw bone.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.414
Okay, okay.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.293
I showed that tooth to Stoddart
in the car park.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.250
I told him I'd found it
in the ground.

33:59.412 --> 34:03.212
He got annoyed when I wouldn't
just hand the thing over.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.797
It got a bit shovey.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.464
And that is absolutely
everything that happened.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.382
So this... this thing...

34:10.549 --> 34:11.891
It's a fake?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.768
He said if I'd found that
on the island,

34:13.927 --> 34:15.554
then it wasn't mine to sell.

34:15.719 --> 34:16.812
And he believed you?

34:16.972 --> 34:18.349
Did he offer you money?

34:18.514 --> 34:20.563
Did he think it was real?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.321
Is this what got him killed?

34:35.031 --> 34:35.998
Natalie?

34:36.157 --> 34:37.123
Vincent?
Follow me.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.706
Are you okay?

34:38.868 --> 34:40.415
Why is he in custody?

34:40.579 --> 34:41.795
Madam, I'm sorry...

34:41.955 --> 34:43.797
What is going on?

34:49.504 --> 34:50.880
Stoddart's been murdered.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.690
<i>Are you having an
affair with Jason Donnelly?</i>

35:05.854 --> 35:09.028
Hildur, it's not an affair.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.490
This is Fortitude.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.327
It gets cold, we get close.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.366
It's uncomplicated.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.420
Are you all right?

35:22.579 --> 35:23.546
What?

35:23.705 --> 35:24.672
Yes, yes, I am.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.178
I loved Charlie too.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.181
He was lovely.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.684
He was a lovely man.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.806
This is just... brutal.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.528
Jason didn't do this.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.529
Do you know that for a fact?

35:48.688 --> 35:50.190
No.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.325
But I was with him.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.204
He was just... ordinary.

35:56.363 --> 35:59.037
He's just an ordinary man.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.916
I want you to take this
to your laboratory

36:04.079 --> 36:05.797
and I want you
to run tests on it,

36:05.955 --> 36:09.300
and I want you to tell me what
kind of animal it came from,

36:09.459 --> 36:10.551
how old it is,

36:10.710 --> 36:12.508
and whether or not
it came from here.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.431
So I can go?

36:16.675 --> 36:17.767
Okay.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.018
You can go.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.032
Natalie.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.664
Listen, you don't tell anyone
about that tooth.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.325
And when you have results,
you bring them to me, all right?

36:41.491 --> 36:42.743
Only me.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.661
Because if there's a mammoth
found on the island,

36:44.828 --> 36:46.671
then I have to handle
that information.

36:46.830 --> 36:47.922
You do understand this?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.342
Right.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.519
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.272
I was just wondering
if your little boy...

37:04.431 --> 37:07.025
If they know how long
he's going to be in here

37:07.183 --> 37:08.526
before he's better.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.362
It's Liam.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.444
Liam.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.950
We couldn't get properly
introduced before.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.611
I'm Henry Tyson.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.905
I know who you are.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.199
When my husband and me decided
we were going to move out here,

37:22.365 --> 37:24.367
Liam got really excited
about seeing polar bears,

37:24.534 --> 37:28.334
so his dad bought him
one of your books.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.089
My book?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.670
Yeah.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.759
Liam will be chuffed
to meet you.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.013
Chuffed.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.720
That's lovely.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.432
Well, I'm chuffed
to meet you both.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.648
You don't have
any grounds

37:51.811 --> 37:53.233
for continuing
to keep me in custody,

37:53.396 --> 37:54.818
and it's probably
in contravention

37:54.981 --> 37:57.154
of the Human Rights Act,
to which I'm sure

37:57.317 --> 37:58.569
you are a signatory.

37:58.735 --> 37:59.861
You can go.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.365
Okay.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.408
Now?

38:05.575 --> 38:06.667
Yes.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.713
I'm sorry you've had
such a horrible time.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.003
No, that's okay.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.092
I understand.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.841
Thank you.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.885
<i>Thuk!</i>

38:31.935 --> 38:33.437
Dan.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.901
<i>Ciaran Donnelly isn't
in his house or in his shop.</i>

38:36.064 --> 38:38.567
<i>We've checked all the bars
in town and nobody's seen him.</i>

38:38.733 --> 38:40.701
Okay, thanks, Ingrid.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.203
We'll find him first thing.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.553
Henry.

39:16.646 --> 39:17.738
Natalie?

39:19.065 --> 39:22.035
Sorry.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.866
I'm DCI Morton.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.123
I'm here investigating the death
of your boss independently,

39:27.282 --> 39:29.080
on behalf of his widow
and the British government.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.875
You're working
with Dan Anderssen?

39:33.037 --> 39:33.879
No.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.290
Why not?

39:35.456 --> 39:37.879
Well, because then I wouldn't
be working independently.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.966
So do you think
it's a mammoth's tooth?

39:41.129 --> 39:42.221
I don't know yet.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.882
Well, what if it is?

39:44.048 --> 39:44.970
What?

39:45.133 --> 39:46.259
A mammoth's tooth.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.723
What if it is a mammoth's tooth?

39:47.886 --> 39:49.513
What are the implications?

39:49.679 --> 39:54.560
You mean could this be
a possible reason

39:54.726 --> 39:57.149
that someone might want
to kill Charlie Stoddart?

39:57.312 --> 39:58.154
Maybe.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.314
Who?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.027
I don't know.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.490
Well, if it turns out that
that's what it is...

40:04.652 --> 40:08.782
Then please call me,
and only me.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.369
Okay?

40:12.535 --> 40:13.787
Thank you.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.938
I just wondered if I could
come in and talk to you.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.225
<i>This has just been
a living nightmare</i>

41:59.392 --> 42:01.986
<i>since the moment
I stepped off the plane.</i>

42:04.731 --> 42:07.154
Maybe I should
just go home.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.578
Maybe you should.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.123
I couldn't.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.289
I can't abandon Charlie's...

42:23.249 --> 42:29.427
He knew this place was fierce,
merciless.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.432
It's neither good nor bad.

42:34.427 --> 42:35.804
Vivid.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.143
And unsullied.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.103
And wild.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.508
Mr. Tyson?

43:15.718 --> 43:16.844
Mr. Tyson?

43:32.777 --> 43:33.949
Mr. Tyson?

43:37.448 --> 43:38.995
Henry?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.284
What? What?

43:40.451 --> 43:41.373
What?

43:41.536 --> 43:42.662
Hi.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.800
I'm DCI Morton
from the London Met, right here.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.085
I'm right here.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.847
Here's my card.

43:57.009 --> 43:59.888
I'll just come back
when you've sobered up.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.657
Your little boy
was unwell.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.193
He was ill.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.030
Now you must be
strong for him.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.540
It was our fault.

44:21.868 --> 44:24.121
You feel guilty.

44:24.287 --> 44:27.040
Guilt connects things
that aren't connected.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.964
You really need
to be strong for Liam,

44:31.127 --> 44:33.471
not full of hate for yourself.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.265
For me.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.682
I felt so ashamed.

44:44.724 --> 44:49.104
I'd just left him on his own.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.446
He could have frozen to death
because of me.

44:54.609 --> 44:55.701
Because of us.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.826
It was irresponsible
and he could have died,

45:02.992 --> 45:05.245
and for what?

46:21.320 --> 46:22.412
Sheriff?

46:24.657 --> 46:26.659
Can I buy you a drink?

46:26.826 --> 46:28.248
No.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.331
Let me buy you one.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.963
All right.

46:35.126 --> 46:39.051
They say the mescal
worm is an aphrodisiac.

46:39.213 --> 46:42.183
If a man and woman
eat the worm together,

46:42.341 --> 46:44.014
then their night
will be a delirium

46:44.176 --> 46:47.350
of ecstasy and passion.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.810
They say that, huh?

46:54.562 --> 46:55.905
They also say that

46:56.063 --> 46:59.988
it's a ferocious irritant
of the urinary tract.

47:05.948 --> 47:08.827
You're not married,
are you?

47:08.993 --> 47:11.792
That's right, I'm not.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.918
And you don't have too much
of a life, do you?

47:17.084 --> 47:18.256
Do you?

47:21.964 --> 47:23.056
Nope.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.852
It can make men very...

47:30.014 --> 47:31.516
Focused.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.684
Dangerous.

47:39.899 --> 47:41.367
You might be right.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.239
To your health.

48:00.419 --> 48:01.045
<i>Don't point the gun!</i>

48:01.212 --> 48:02.008
Liam!

48:02.171 --> 48:03.013
Do something!

48:03.172 --> 48:04.515
You spoke to my colleague.

48:04.673 --> 48:05.720
Do you remember?

48:05.883 --> 48:07.385
I'm the inevitable
consequence.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.474
<i>She thinks you
killed her husband.</i>

48:09.637 --> 48:10.763
<i>Or some poor bastard</i>

48:10.930 --> 48:12.352
<i>has a psychotic episode
in a stranger's house.</i>

48:12.515 --> 48:13.983
<i>I think Frank Sutter is the man</i>

48:14.141 --> 48:15.358
<i>they should be looking at.</i>

48:15.518 --> 48:17.361
<i>He is violent and unstable.</i>

48:21.500 --> 48:31.500
