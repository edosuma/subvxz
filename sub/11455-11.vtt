Previously on The
Girlfriend Experience...

00:20.200 --> 00:22.666
Mom is really upset. We all are.

00:22.733 --> 00:23.866
I can't talk right now.

00:23.933 --> 00:26.166
What was that
video? Why did you send it?

00:26.233 --> 00:27.699
I have to go.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.233
I think it's best if you leave.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.866
Whatever you want.

00:37.933 --> 00:39.199
So you're new at this?

00:39.266 --> 00:40.932
Eight to nine months.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.300
I'm looking to expand my client base.

00:43.366 --> 00:45.966
How much am I paying
you? A thousand an hour?

00:46.033 --> 00:48.066
Fifteen hundred.

00:49.766 --> 00:51.132
Here's ten thousand.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.733
- Colin.
- Nice to see you.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.866
- You must be Amanda.
- Hi.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.866
I'm so sorry. Um, would you
just excuse me for a second?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.066
Hey Martin, I'm just in
the middle of something.

00:59.133 --> 01:00.199
Can I call you back?

01:00.333 --> 01:02.299
I need to speak to you now, if possible.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.166
Somebody sent the tape toChicago Lister.

01:04.233 --> 01:05.766
They just ran a story.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.799
It turns you on, getting paid.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.133
Say it!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.666
I'm glad I didn't scare you away.

01:29.733 --> 01:31.999
Hmmm, not at all.

01:32.066 --> 01:34.232
I was hoping to hear from you again.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.566
- Where are you?
- Chicago.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.266
Can you come see me this weekend?

01:40.333 --> 01:44.166
I can't, I'm taking a break for a while.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.299
But we can talk like this.

01:46.366 --> 01:48.199
It's my fault.

01:48.266 --> 01:49.732
You don't want to see me.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.200
That's not true. I'm happy to see you.

01:53.266 --> 01:56.032
There's nothing wrong with what we did.

01:57.366 --> 02:00.032
Could I see your face?

02:00.166 --> 02:02.432
I can't.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.200
Is there something
else you'd like to see?

02:05.266 --> 02:07.866
Yes.

02:42.427 --> 02:45.087
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans

02:45.088 --> 02:46.232
Excuse me.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.000
Sorry, am I in your way?

02:48.066 --> 02:49.866
No need to apologize.

02:49.933 --> 02:52.199
- How's your day?
- How do you think?

02:52.266 --> 02:54.866
Well, I can only
imagine, especially for interns.

02:54.933 --> 02:57.233
What exactly can you imagine?

02:57.300 --> 03:00.133
Just have a lot to take in.

03:00.399 --> 03:03.565
I wanna make something very clear.

03:03.633 --> 03:06.633
You're making me feel very,
very uncomfortable.

03:06.699 --> 03:08.199
Yeah, uncomfortable how?

03:08.266 --> 03:09.932
What-what are you talking about?

03:09.999 --> 03:11.599
I think you know what I'm talking about.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.699
Interns are just all stretched too thin?

03:13.766 --> 03:16.332
- You're all overworked.
- I don't think that's what you meant.

03:16.399 --> 03:17.565
- I dunno what you're talking about...
- Okay.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.999
Let's all just take it down a notch.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.299
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?

03:24.699 --> 03:26.199
Yeah.

03:31.399 --> 03:35.032
And if I don't?

03:35.099 --> 03:37.332
Then I'll have to fire you.

03:45.066 --> 03:46.466
David Tellis was your boss?

03:46.533 --> 03:49.066
I was his intern.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.841
I wanna sue for sexual harassment

03:50.866 --> 03:52.523
and a hostile work environment.

03:53.762 --> 03:55.442
Kirkland might argue
that you intentionally

03:55.499 --> 03:56.699
brought this on yourself.

03:56.766 --> 04:00.032
That you incited these
reactions and recorded them

04:00.099 --> 04:02.565
to file a lawsuit, but,

04:02.699 --> 04:06.265
given the balance of power between
you and David Tellis,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.633
you have a strong case.

04:08.699 --> 04:10.232
I have something else.

04:12.266 --> 04:14.032
You like getting
paid for sex, don't you?

04:14.099 --> 04:15.032
Yes!

04:15.099 --> 04:17.565
It turns you on, getting paid.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.399
So this could be
misconstrued as an act of prostitution.

04:20.466 --> 04:22.699
How do we all wanna handle it?

04:22.766 --> 04:24.474
Christine knowingly made the tape

04:24.499 --> 04:26.156
with her boyfriend at the time.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.699
They were role-playing.

04:28.766 --> 04:31.332
And the fact that his
voice is distorted?

04:31.399 --> 04:34.399
It was obviously put out to humiliate
and shame Christine.

04:34.466 --> 04:36.632
She broke up with him a month prior.

04:36.699 --> 04:38.699
So are we saying he released it?

04:38.766 --> 04:40.266
At this point, it
doesn't matter who released it.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.933
Kirkland mishandled it.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.365
The goal is to force a settlement.

04:44.433 --> 04:45.699
Okay, got it.

04:45.766 --> 04:47.566
We should set a follow-up
with Chicago Lister

04:47.633 --> 04:49.266
to get out Christine's
side of the story.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.266
Do you feel
comfortable doing interviews?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.399
Yeah, I have nothing to hide.

04:53.466 --> 04:54.432
Good.

04:54.499 --> 04:56.065
Make sure to stress your embarrassment.

04:56.133 --> 04:58.499
It's important to get
people to sympathize with you.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.599
I am extremely embarrassed.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.666
As you can imagine, this has
been very humiliating for me.

05:03.733 --> 05:06.066
It was a private
moment between two adults

05:06.133 --> 05:08.499
that I didn't think would be seen.

05:08.566 --> 05:11.699
Did you accept
money in exchange for sex?

05:11.766 --> 05:14.699
I'm not answering that question.

05:14.766 --> 05:17.499
Are you concerned that
your law career is over?

05:17.566 --> 05:19.466
Yes. Of course.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.133
I've worked really hard,

05:21.199 --> 05:23.699
and spent a lot of
money to get to this point.

05:23.766 --> 05:26.132
You could go into private practice.

05:26.199 --> 05:28.465
- Is that a joke?
- No.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.699
No, I'm being serious.

05:30.766 --> 05:33.832
I'd like to remain
optimistic, but unfortunately as a woman,

05:33.899 --> 05:36.332
it's difficult to be
seen as a sexual person

05:36.399 --> 05:39.065
and a competent
professional at the same time.

05:39.133 --> 05:42.166
Unless sex is your profession.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.399
You did say you like
to get paid for sex.

05:44.466 --> 05:45.699
I like sex.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.766
I was role-playing. Is that a problem?

05:47.833 --> 05:49.499
So you knew you were being recorded?

05:49.566 --> 05:50.966
Yes.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.266
Again, it was a private moment with
a person that I cared about.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.333
The tape was for us, not for the public.

05:55.399 --> 05:56.832
Why did your ex release it?

05:56.899 --> 05:58.699
I don't know who released it.

05:58.766 --> 06:01.166
Well, his voice is
distorted on the tape,

06:01.332 --> 06:03.432
and you said you broke
up with him a month earlier.

06:03.499 --> 06:05.265
You don't think there's a connection?

06:05.332 --> 06:07.698
You don't think he
did it out of revenge?

06:07.766 --> 06:10.566
Again, I don't know if
he released the tape.

06:10.632 --> 06:12.598
We ended on good terms.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.366
So...

06:14.432 --> 06:16.298
You're not angry, at all?

06:16.366 --> 06:18.599
Of course, I'm angry!

06:18.666 --> 06:21.299
I'm angry that my family and friends
have to deal with this.

06:21.366 --> 06:23.599
I'm angry that I lost my internship.

06:23.666 --> 06:26.532
I'm angry that Kirkland
didn't handle things better and that

06:26.599 --> 06:28.265
people jumped to conclusions

06:28.332 --> 06:29.898
before hearing my side of the story.

06:35.799 --> 06:36.932
Go ahead.

06:42.566 --> 06:44.532
Go ahead.

06:58.599 --> 07:00.532
- Hi.
- Hey...

07:00.666 --> 07:01.799
Are you okay?

07:01.866 --> 07:02.889
Yeah.

07:03.158 --> 07:04.999
There's nothing to worry
about. They don't have any evidence.

07:05.066 --> 07:07.499
- Just let me do the talking.
- I'm not worried.

07:07.566 --> 07:09.766
- Miss Reade?
- Yes.

07:09.832 --> 07:12.498
I'm Justin Grevillius, aide to Assistant
District Attorney Stanley.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.932
I'm Martin Bayley, Miss
Reade's attorney.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.665
- We spoke on the phone.
- Yeah.

07:15.732 --> 07:17.132
This way.

07:23.432 --> 07:26.498
We saw theChicago Listerstory.

07:26.566 --> 07:28.432
Who is the man with you in the video?

07:28.499 --> 07:30.599
He was a former boyfriend of my client.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.632
She doesn't want to reveal his identity.

07:32.699 --> 07:35.865
Why not? It's a criminal
act if he hacked her email.

07:35.932 --> 07:37.665
We don't know who emailed the tape.

07:37.732 --> 07:39.165
Well, we could find out.

07:39.232 --> 07:41.232
Doesn't matter, my client doesn't
want to press charges.

07:41.299 --> 07:43.865
Why not?

07:43.932 --> 07:46.498
Cause you're engaging in prostitution?

07:46.566 --> 07:47.732
There was no money involved.

07:47.799 --> 07:50.932
My client was simply role-playing.

07:50.999 --> 07:53.499
You don't have a case.

07:55.399 --> 07:57.499
Why do you want me to
delete all our correspondence?

07:57.566 --> 07:59.632
Is it 'cause you're worried
I'm gonna tell someone about us?

07:59.699 --> 08:01.832
I'm not worried. You're
gonna do what you're gonna do.

08:01.966 --> 08:03.699
Does Megan know?

08:03.766 --> 08:06.699
Did you tell your wife about us?

08:06.766 --> 08:08.566
I don't understand why
you won't talk to me.

08:08.632 --> 08:09.932
I don't know what I did wrong.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.199
I miss spending time with you.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.232
Stay the fuck away from me!

08:13.299 --> 08:15.632
You are fucking insane!

08:15.699 --> 08:18.632
Miss Reade's lawyer also
sent over a video recording

08:18.699 --> 08:21.099
of you having sex with
her in your apartment.

08:22.866 --> 08:26.732
Is there something
else you wanna tell us?

08:26.799 --> 08:30.565
No? Nothing?

08:30.632 --> 08:32.032
You're through.

09:51.599 --> 09:53.399
I'm leaving for the day.

09:53.465 --> 09:55.531
You have a call with
Lisa Harrison at three.

09:55.599 --> 09:58.032
- Do you want me to re-schedule?
- I'll have to get back to you.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.665
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks.

10:28.565 --> 10:29.498
Fuck!

10:29.565 --> 10:31.898
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

10:31.965 --> 10:33.631
Fuck!

10:33.699 --> 10:35.499
Fuck!

10:39.865 --> 10:42.765
David's intentionally
throwing the XHP case.

10:42.832 --> 10:45.732
That's a very serious accusation.

10:45.799 --> 10:48.099
It's not an accusation.

10:48.165 --> 10:49.798
Play it.

10:49.865 --> 10:51.798
It is not going to trial.

10:51.865 --> 10:55.531
I got it. I will make
sure it is not going to trial.

10:55.599 --> 10:57.432
Our deal still stands.

10:57.499 --> 10:58.599
Yeah.

10:58.665 --> 11:01.031
The check goes to
Quorta. Still the same.

11:02.799 --> 11:04.565
What do you know about Quorta?

11:04.632 --> 11:05.998
Nothing.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.065
Well why do you think she came to you?

11:08.132 --> 11:09.381
I'm not entirely sure. Maybe

11:09.406 --> 11:11.056
because I took an interest in her,

11:11.099 --> 11:13.232
as a young woman starting her career.

11:13.299 --> 11:16.499
Did she mention her
sexual relationship with David?

11:16.565 --> 11:18.365
No, not to me.

11:18.432 --> 11:20.397
She's threatening sexual harassment and

11:20.422 --> 11:22.189
hostile work environment lawsuits.

11:22.232 --> 11:23.598
We're going to have to negotiate.

11:23.665 --> 11:25.998
We want you to be part of it.

11:26.065 --> 11:27.831
You need a woman to be there.

11:31.432 --> 11:34.265
You'll be taking David's position
as Managing Partner.

11:36.899 --> 11:38.571
Your client accessed confidential

11:38.596 --> 11:39.923
files without permission,

11:39.965 --> 11:42.031
sent a sexually-explicit video of herself

11:42.099 --> 11:43.599
to the entire staff at Kirkland,

11:43.665 --> 11:45.098
targeted her co-workers,

11:45.165 --> 11:47.231
and secretly recorded their reactions,

11:47.299 --> 11:50.365
violating state wiretapping laws.

11:50.432 --> 11:51.965
She purposely created this scenario

11:52.032 --> 11:54.398
to make herself look
like a victim and bring suit.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.065
Well, that's one way to look at it.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.098
But from another
perspective, one of your managing partners

11:59.165 --> 12:01.626
coerced a young intern into
a sexual relationship.

12:01.865 --> 12:04.998
He publicly humiliated her in
an effort to discredit her

12:05.065 --> 12:06.353
and to stop her from revealing

12:06.378 --> 12:08.222
information that could damage your firm.

12:08.265 --> 12:11.565
Are you suggesting Tellis sent
out the sex tape himself?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.697
Are you sure that he didn't?

12:13.765 --> 12:15.798
At the end of the
day, it doesn't matter.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.401
If my client continues to go public

12:17.426 --> 12:19.089
with further details about your firm,

12:19.131 --> 12:20.997
you will lose.

12:21.065 --> 12:24.065
The rest is just noise.

12:24.131 --> 12:25.864
Write her a check.

12:30.265 --> 12:33.065
Christine?

12:33.131 --> 12:35.831
- Jacqueline?
- Wow, it's so good to see you!

12:37.731 --> 12:40.131
Are you, ahh, meeting someone?

12:40.198 --> 12:42.698
I am, actually.

12:42.765 --> 12:45.698
- My lawyer.
- Oh good!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.831
So tell me, what've you been up to?

12:47.898 --> 12:48.931
How's the apartment?

12:48.998 --> 12:50.698
It's great.

12:50.765 --> 12:53.865
I'm just getting settled, starting
to feel like it's mine.

12:53.931 --> 12:56.697
I think I know what you mean.

12:56.765 --> 12:58.131
Wow, that is...

12:58.198 --> 12:59.931
just a beautiful top.

13:00.065 --> 13:01.265
Thank you.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.404
I'm really happy to see that

13:06.429 --> 13:08.321
things are going so well for you.

13:08.365 --> 13:11.065
I've actually gotta get going.

13:11.131 --> 13:12.764
Okay, I understand.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.331
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:33.198 --> 13:35.131
Kirkland's gonna settle.

13:35.198 --> 13:36.798
They wanna resolve it immediately.

13:36.865 --> 13:39.631
- How much?
- A million.

13:39.698 --> 13:43.131
They're insisting on a gag clause.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.964
Can we get more?

13:45.031 --> 13:47.764
You should take it.
You don't understand.

13:47.831 --> 13:49.097
You've already won.

14:12.898 --> 14:16.264
- Do you know him?
- No.

14:16.331 --> 14:18.364
We could have met at my office.

14:18.431 --> 14:21.697
It's fine.

14:28.898 --> 14:31.831
There are two
bedrooms, two full bathrooms,

14:31.898 --> 14:33.264
hardwood floors,

14:33.331 --> 14:34.664
a washer/dryer,

14:34.731 --> 14:36.997
and a gourmet kitchen
with a granite island.

14:39.131 --> 14:42.464
There's also an indoor pool
and a 24-hour fitness center.

14:45.398 --> 14:46.864
It's a quiet building.

14:46.931 --> 14:48.731
Mostly professionals.

14:53.098 --> 14:54.298
Hi, Amanda...

14:54.365 --> 14:55.831
Hi, Dennis!

14:55.898 --> 14:58.064
I missed seeing you.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.831
I miss seeing you, too.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.031
How are you?

15:01.231 --> 15:02.297
I'm good!

15:05.131 --> 15:07.331
I want to touch you.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.497
I wanna cum on your face.

15:17.564 --> 15:20.297
Do it. I want you to.

15:48.897 --> 15:52.963
There's a number of
options, depending on your income.

15:53.031 --> 15:54.464
I'm keeping a low profile.

15:54.531 --> 15:56.997
At the moment, I'm just
camming, which isn't very much money,

15:57.064 --> 15:59.497
but I plan on starting back
up again in the next few months.

15:59.564 --> 16:02.197
I understand. Whenever you're ready.

16:02.331 --> 16:04.397
One option is to go off-shore,

16:04.464 --> 16:07.130
but that can be very
costly to set up and maintain,

16:07.197 --> 16:09.037
so I wouldn't recommend
it unless you're making

16:09.097 --> 16:11.197
a substantial amount of money.

16:11.264 --> 16:14.130
Another way is to set up
a corporation anonymously,

16:14.197 --> 16:16.997
either in Wyoming or in Nevada.

16:17.064 --> 16:19.164
You'll be the sole shareholder,

16:19.231 --> 16:21.964
but the registered agent will
be the primary contact.

16:22.031 --> 16:24.964
And they'll go on
public record, not you.

16:25.031 --> 16:28.531
And most importantly, you can
declare your income to the IRS,

16:28.597 --> 16:30.163
which will keep them off your back.

16:36.131 --> 16:38.497
- Is Amanda your real name?
- Yes.

16:40.297 --> 16:42.263
Show me your face.

16:42.331 --> 16:45.464
You'll have to meet me
in person to see my face.

16:45.531 --> 16:47.264
Show me your pussy.

16:57.031 --> 16:59.497
Push it up to the front of the screen.

18:22.297 --> 18:24.363
You're so beautiful, Meg.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.730
I missed you.

18:53.797 --> 18:55.363
Please stop saying that.

19:18.364 --> 19:20.364
Take off your shirt.

19:22.164 --> 19:23.897
I wanna keep it on.

19:23.964 --> 19:25.397
I wanna feel your skin.

19:30.364 --> 19:32.164
I wanna keep it on.

19:44.297 --> 19:45.497
I can't...

19:45.564 --> 19:48.164
- Huh?
- I can't!

19:48.230 --> 19:49.863
I can't.

19:54.297 --> 19:56.363
I can't stop thinking about
you with other women.

20:09.264 --> 20:10.297
- David...
- Chris.

20:10.364 --> 20:11.597
- How are you?
- Good.

20:11.664 --> 20:13.364
Good. Jim's gonna meet
us in the conference room.

20:13.430 --> 20:16.096
Great.

20:16.164 --> 20:17.964
- So how's the family?
- Great.

20:18.030 --> 20:19.330
Thanks for asking, how's yours?

20:19.397 --> 20:21.363
Kids aren't in jail
yet, so it's a good week.

20:23.164 --> 20:25.064
You need anything? Water, coffee?

20:25.130 --> 20:26.563
- No, I'm good.
- All right.

20:26.630 --> 20:28.096
And thanks for making the time.

20:28.164 --> 20:30.864
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah, of course.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.330
- Well, people talk.
- Hmmm.

20:33.397 --> 20:36.297
But we know that you're
a good lawyer and uh...

20:36.364 --> 20:39.164
We wanted to get your side.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.363
Well I'm not exactly
sure what you've heard,

20:41.430 --> 20:43.996
Christine Reade, an intern,

20:44.064 --> 20:46.497
accused me of...

20:46.564 --> 20:49.097
uh, being sexually involved with her,

20:49.164 --> 20:51.097
and it wasn't true.

20:51.164 --> 20:54.197
She's unstable and had
a nervous breakdown.

20:54.264 --> 20:56.530
I discussed it with the
other partners and we decided

20:56.597 --> 21:00.063
the best way to minimize the
damage was to part ways.

21:00.596 --> 21:03.296
And how long were you at Kirkland?

21:03.363 --> 21:06.029
Fifteen years.

21:06.096 --> 21:07.862
Well, that's unfortunate.

21:11.629 --> 21:13.829
It turns you on, getting paid.

21:16.096 --> 21:17.462
Say it!

21:17.529 --> 21:18.662
It turns me on!

21:26.896 --> 21:28.829
Take it in all the way.

21:38.129 --> 21:39.762
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

21:39.829 --> 21:40.762
Yes.

21:40.829 --> 21:42.829
It turns you on, getting paid.

21:45.496 --> 21:46.629
Say it!

21:46.696 --> 21:47.929
It turns me on!

22:03.929 --> 22:05.029
It's David.

22:05.096 --> 22:06.429
I wanna see you.

22:57.629 --> 22:59.629
- Yes?
- It's David.

22:59.696 --> 23:01.596
I wanna see you.

23:01.729 --> 23:03.095
Why?

23:03.163 --> 23:04.317
I wanna talk. I have something

23:04.342 --> 23:05.187
I need to tell you.

23:14.263 --> 23:15.829
I'm meeting someone.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.296
Thanks for coming.

23:23.996 --> 23:25.562
You're not staying?

23:25.629 --> 23:26.629
I have to be somewhere soon.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.096
I thought we were gonna have lunch.

23:28.163 --> 23:31.629
What did you wanna talk about?

23:31.696 --> 23:34.596
You know I'm no longer at Kirkland.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.596
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm not staying.

23:37.663 --> 23:39.263
Oh, let me know if you change your mind.

23:44.196 --> 23:47.196
I'm not at Kirkland. They let me go.

23:47.263 --> 23:50.096
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.963
What did you think would happen?

23:52.029 --> 23:54.562
You recorded our conversations.

23:54.629 --> 23:56.829
You recorded us having sex...

23:56.896 --> 23:58.829
I didn't do anything wrong.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.604
I thought we could
have a serious conversation.

24:00.729 --> 24:02.762
So did I. I was an intern.

24:02.829 --> 24:04.329
You just wanted to
fuck me and get rid of me

24:04.354 --> 24:05.819
when it wasn't
convenient for you anymore.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.795
You didn't seem to care about my career.

24:07.862 --> 24:09.528
What "career"?

24:09.595 --> 24:10.761
I didn't ask for this.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.029
I just dealt with it.

24:12.095 --> 24:13.528
So you don't have a
job at Kirkland anymore,

24:13.595 --> 24:14.528
how is that my problem?

24:14.595 --> 24:15.728
You have connections.

24:15.795 --> 24:17.095
Go out and get another
job and stop blaming me.

24:17.162 --> 24:20.895
You recorded us having
sex, and you used it against me.

24:20.962 --> 24:22.428
You planned this.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.395
Welcome to the club.

24:24.462 --> 24:27.262
And that video of you fucking that guy?

24:27.329 --> 24:28.895
You were fucking him for money.

24:28.962 --> 24:30.762
How the fuck do you know?

24:30.829 --> 24:32.962
- You're guessing.
- You were paid to be there.

24:33.029 --> 24:33.962
Everybody's paid to be everywhere.

24:34.029 --> 24:35.529
It's called an economy.

24:35.595 --> 24:38.528
- You just want the money.
- I want everything about it!

24:38.595 --> 24:39.995
I fucked people, David,

24:40.062 --> 24:42.662
but I didn't fuck them over,
like you were doing with XHP.

24:42.729 --> 24:44.529
And you started this, you wanted this!

24:44.595 --> 24:46.628
And I'm selling, yeah, but I
know exactly what I'm selling,

24:46.695 --> 24:48.335
and they know exactly
what they're buying.

24:48.395 --> 24:49.928
Yeah, cause you're a fucking whore!

24:49.995 --> 24:52.928
What did you say?

24:52.995 --> 24:54.528
You called me a fucking whore.

24:54.595 --> 24:55.795
Say it again.

25:31.062 --> 25:33.462
Don't stop. Keep going.

25:33.529 --> 25:36.529
- Are you close?
- Don't talk, just watch me.
