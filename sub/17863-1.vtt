I can hear you breathing.
Please stop.

00:10.779 --> 00:16.271
Eggs Dauphine, my lady. -Blanche,
I said I wanted scrambled eggs.

00:16.772 --> 00:20.692
Blanche, you idiot!
You got egg upon my snood!

00:20.734 --> 00:22.257
He was going to
wear that today!

00:22.299 --> 00:25.620
Now he has to select
another snood!

00:25.662 --> 00:28.750
I'm Lillian. I'm the pretty,
smart, funny, ambitious,

00:28.792 --> 00:31.712
nice body,
soon-to-be famous one.

00:31.754 --> 00:36.447
And I'm Beatrice.
I'm the pretty one.

00:36.915 --> 00:39.670
Sir, telegram for you,
Lady Beatrice.

00:39.712 --> 00:41.268
Ooh!

00:41.310 --> 00:43.431
[clears throat]

00:43.473 --> 00:46.328
Oh. Mm.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.226
[sighs]

00:48.268 --> 00:53.653
What does it say? -I don't
know how to read. -Right.

00:53.695 --> 00:58.114
Oh, Darling, your friends,
the Claudette Sisters?

00:58.156 --> 00:59.679
They've passed.

00:59.721 --> 01:01.144
[gasps]

01:01.186 --> 01:04.141
Our best friends died! -Finally!

01:04.183 --> 01:07.303
The Claudette sisters' passing means
there's 2 spots open in the Newport 400...

01:07.345 --> 01:10.699
the 400 most important
white people in all of America.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.396
And I know who's
going to fill them.

01:13.438 --> 01:15.161
Who?

01:15.203 --> 01:16.326
Us.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.656
Well, I'd like to propose a toast
to the death of our social rivals.

01:18.698 --> 01:19.622
To the Claudette sisters!

01:19.664 --> 01:23.484
And to tuberculosis for taking
their lives at such a young age.

01:23.526 --> 01:25.149
Yes!
- [laughter]

01:25.191 --> 01:27.612

(Lillian)
Tonight's a very big night
and we have to look our best

01:49.428 --> 01:51.151
because the head
of the Newport 400,

01:51.193 --> 01:53.548
the Marquis de Sainsbury is
coming to meet us.

01:53.590 --> 01:57.210
He alone decides whether we will
finally make it into society.

01:57.252 --> 02:00.506
And when he arrives we'll prove
we're the very definition

02:00.548 --> 02:03.536
of class and distinction.

02:03.578 --> 02:04.401
Hello.

02:04.443 --> 02:08.697
(Peepers)
I want those peacocks' teeth
brushed.

02:08.739 --> 02:12.259
What is this? What are you? We don't
allow street urchins in this home.

02:12.301 --> 02:14.223
Sir, I'm the new servant girl,
Celine.

02:14.265 --> 02:16.587
Servant girl?
You smell of chicken gizzards.

02:16.629 --> 02:19.017
Why are you dawdling?
We're on a very tight schedule

02:19.059 --> 02:20.315
as we have
an important guest arriving.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.413
Now, some of your duties will
include winding the clock,

02:23.455 --> 02:28.306
exercising the swans,
bloodletting, ghost removal.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.371
I am Mr. Peepers.

02:29.413 --> 02:31.269
I am head butler to
the illustrious Bellacourts.

02:31.311 --> 02:35.132
They are, of course, the family
of the great magnet magnate,

02:35.174 --> 02:38.661
Commodore Bellacourt
and his lovely wife Dodo.

02:38.703 --> 02:43.554
Yogurt spoon, pudding spoon,
fish fork, crab tong.

02:43.596 --> 02:48.548
Yogurt spoon, pudding spoon, fish
fork, crab tong. Yogurt spoon.

02:48.590 --> 02:51.445
Blanche!
- [screams]

02:51.487 --> 02:53.975
[cries]

02:54.017 --> 02:56.805
This is Blanche's first week
back from the asylum.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.969
Some people think
she's dangerous,

02:59.011 --> 03:02.099
but the only person she's
likely to harm is herself.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.362
We have a lot of fun
with her.

03:05.404 --> 03:08.459
(Blanche)
I have been diagnosed with
hysteria.

03:08.501 --> 03:09.390
And because of that,

03:09.432 --> 03:11.622
the state made Mr. Peepers
my legal guardian.

03:11.664 --> 03:13.619
Which basically means he can
throw me in the nuthouse

03:13.661 --> 03:16.582
just because
he goddamn feels like it.

03:16.624 --> 03:20.544
Frederick, when are you
going to take a wife?

03:20.586 --> 03:22.508
Mother, I'm in love
with someone.

03:22.550 --> 03:27.302
Well, what's that
got to do with anything?

03:27.344 --> 03:28.534
Good morning.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.864
Hello, I am Frederick.

03:30.906 --> 03:31.930
Yes, I know, sir.

03:31.972 --> 03:35.226
I've been taking care of you
since you were born.

03:35.268 --> 03:37.923
What is that?

03:37.965 --> 03:41.319
I'm sorry you had to see this poor
person in street clothes, Madam.

03:41.361 --> 03:44.415
Luella hurled herself
from the balcony.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.178
This is her replacement.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.475
Servant, what is your name?

03:49.517 --> 03:51.074
My name is Celine, Madam.

03:51.116 --> 03:51.673
[laughs]

03:51.715 --> 03:55.102
That's not a servant's name.
You should be called Barb.

03:55.144 --> 04:00.030
Oh no, dear, that won't do.
I had that cat named Barb.

04:00.072 --> 04:02.760
Ooh, I know!
You should be called Chair.

04:02.802 --> 04:06.556
Beatrice, that's
a wonderful idea.

04:06.598 --> 04:10.957
Servant, your name is Chair now.

04:12.091 --> 04:14.412
Chair, meet Mayor Cutie.

04:14.454 --> 04:18.947
Shake her hand, Chair.

04:23.277 --> 04:26.505
You're welcome.

04:31.001 --> 04:32.191
Thank God
we're finally alone.

04:32.233 --> 04:35.521
Yes, finally. Just you
and I and no one else around.

04:35.563 --> 04:39.756
Not a soul in the world
but you and I.

04:40.523 --> 04:43.844
Oh, Frederick,
why can't we be married?

04:43.886 --> 04:45.475
Because you're my sister.

04:45.517 --> 04:46.940
Oh, applesauce.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.870
Oh God, it turns me on
when you say that word.

04:49.912 --> 04:53.199
I want you now, right here.

04:53.241 --> 04:57.827
Yes, Frederick.

04:57.869 --> 05:00.124
Undress for me.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.123
Yes.

05:01.165 --> 05:03.454
Yes.

05:03.496 --> 05:07.849
Whew.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.079
Slower.

05:10.121 --> 05:12.044
Oh, just a few more minutes.

05:12.086 --> 05:15.207
Oh, my goodness,
in a few more minutes,

05:15.249 --> 05:19.135
you will be mine.

05:19.177 --> 05:22.331
Yes.

05:22.373 --> 05:24.702
There you are.

05:25.503 --> 05:29.156
You ready for me right now?

05:29.198 --> 05:30.854
Mm-hmm. Yes, Frederick.

05:30.896 --> 05:34.890
Shall I? -Yes.

05:36.323 --> 05:40.476
Here it comes.

05:40.518 --> 05:44.838
Oh, your body.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.203
Oh, God.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.300
Yes, yes.

05:48.342 --> 05:49.931

Almost ready?

05:49.973 --> 05:54.026
Almost ready.

05:54.068 --> 05:57.229
Yes.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.216
(Beatrice)
Oh, yes.

06:02.258 --> 06:03.748
And this is your room.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.678
This is where you'll be living,
if you play your cards right,

06:06.720 --> 06:09.108
for the next 40 years.
Alone.

06:09.150 --> 06:10.007
[bell rings]

06:10.049 --> 06:11.106
My God, that's
the custard bell.

06:11.148 --> 06:14.169
When I return, I expect
you to be covered up.

06:14.211 --> 06:17.871
This isn't a bordello.

06:20.837 --> 06:24.057
Bald eagle
and toast points again?

06:24.099 --> 06:27.220
Yuck!

06:27.262 --> 06:30.783
Hortense,
that's enough food for you.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.746
Lady Hortense
is my eldest daughter.

06:33.788 --> 06:36.076
She suffers from
a variety of ailments

06:36.118 --> 06:39.106
from photosensitivity
to thigh heft.

06:39.148 --> 06:44.033
One can only hope she'll live
a mercifully short life.

06:44.075 --> 06:45.299
I hope you plan on shaving
your mole

06:45.341 --> 06:48.228
for my induction into
the Newport 400 this evening.

06:48.270 --> 06:49.327
Oh, no, is that tonight?

06:49.369 --> 06:51.857
I suppose I shouldn't have
invited my guests over then.

06:51.899 --> 06:54.754
Who did you invite?
You don't have any friends.

06:54.796 --> 06:55.419
Oh, no one.

06:55.461 --> 06:58.615
Just somebody I met in
the Women's Temperance League.

06:58.657 --> 07:02.119
Named Helen Keller.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.205
What, are we supposed to know
who in the hell that is?

07:07.247 --> 07:09.836
Is she that gal that
can't smell?

07:09.878 --> 07:12.000
She's blind and deaf, you ninny.

07:12.042 --> 07:15.163
[laughs]

07:15.205 --> 07:16.262
Are you serious?

07:16.304 --> 07:19.058
You can't have poor people
at my party!

07:19.100 --> 07:20.823
Show some compassion, Lillian.

07:20.865 --> 07:24.352
Hore doesn't have anything else
to live for.

07:24.394 --> 07:25.650
My name is Hortense.

07:25.692 --> 07:28.247
Whatever, Hore, at least
our faces are symmetrical!

07:28.289 --> 07:30.145
Yeah, at least we don't wear
face windows!

07:30.187 --> 07:32.309
And at least we're not barren!

07:32.351 --> 07:34.073
[laughter]

07:34.115 --> 07:36.970
I hope inviting the most
important woman in America over

07:37.012 --> 07:41.870
doesn't upstage my darling
sister on her big day.

07:53.592 --> 07:55.514

think you're going?

07:55.556 --> 07:57.379
Well, we're going off
to war, of course.

07:57.421 --> 07:59.477
You can't go to war.
We're having a party.

07:59.519 --> 08:02.972
Yeah, which war is it,

08:05.943 --> 08:07.101
that we really must go to. -Yes.

08:07.143 --> 08:09.530
I let you leave through
all eight of my childbirths.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.361
You can't leave tonight. The
Marquis de Sainsbury is coming.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.125
What would I have done
during the labors?

08:14.167 --> 08:15.358
I would have just
gotten in the way.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.522
You think I wanted to be there?!

08:16.564 --> 08:19.453
The marriage involves a dowry,
which is quite valuable.

08:19.495 --> 08:22.216
(Victor)
It's almost like
a prize that you get

08:22.258 --> 08:24.014
for enduring something horrible

08:24.056 --> 08:28.215
or something that makes you
want to throw up.

08:29.882 --> 08:30.406
[giggling]

08:30.448 --> 08:32.403
When you put two penises
side by side,

08:32.445 --> 08:36.066
that's called log stacking.

08:36.107 --> 08:37.830
(Peepers)
Now that the Bellacourts are fed
and ready,

08:37.871 --> 08:41.359
it is the servants' turn to eat
their single meal of the day.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.228
This is what we call "All Meal."

08:49.325 --> 08:52.047
So, Chair, are you having fun
on your first day?

08:52.089 --> 08:53.911
Just think, in 20 years,
you could be

08:53.953 --> 08:56.775
head assistant housemaid
like Blanche.

08:56.817 --> 08:58.805
That is, if Blanche
is dead by then.

08:58.847 --> 09:00.103
And if you ever need help
walking the peacocks

09:00.145 --> 09:03.832
or transporting the family
feces, just let me know, Chair.

09:03.874 --> 09:05.097
For God's sake,
my name isn't Chair.

09:05.139 --> 09:09.027
My mother named me Celine before
she died giving birth to me.

09:09.069 --> 09:12.190
It was the only gift
she ever gave me.

09:12.232 --> 09:16.084
Boohoo! All our mothers
died in childbirth!

09:16.126 --> 09:17.916
Do you think I was born Peepers?

09:17.958 --> 09:21.977
I was once known as Mitch.
A word of warning, Chair.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.208
If you find yourself incapable
of doing your duties,

09:24.250 --> 09:27.337
you can hit the streets and
begin your new life as a beggar.

09:27.379 --> 09:30.401
Oh, Chair is much too pretty
to be a beggar.

09:30.443 --> 09:31.766
Thank you, Garfield.

09:31.808 --> 09:34.829
Oh, yes, she most definitely
would be a prostitute.

09:34.871 --> 09:36.426
An expensive one, too.

09:36.468 --> 09:39.323
Yeah, she'd know how to do
all the weird stuff.

09:39.365 --> 09:42.053
I'm not going to die!

09:42.095 --> 09:45.016
People are living into
their 50s these days.

09:45.058 --> 09:47.347
And I'm not going to
be here either.

09:47.389 --> 09:50.877
I have dreams, you know.
Big dreams.

09:50.919 --> 09:54.938
No offense, Blanche, but I don't
think you'd make it as a prostitute.

09:54.980 --> 09:58.833
No. I'm going to work
in a factory.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.863
[laughter]

10:01.905 --> 10:05.226
You? In a factory? -With your face?

10:05.268 --> 10:06.857
Do you have some magic genie

10:06.899 --> 10:08.688
that we don't know about,
Blanche?

10:08.730 --> 10:09.920
You're a piece of shit.

10:09.962 --> 10:11.984
If you really want to make it
out of this house,

10:12.026 --> 10:16.079
you need to use the only thing
a woman has going for her.

10:16.121 --> 10:18.577
Her piss flaps!

10:18.619 --> 10:19.875
[laughs]

10:19.917 --> 10:22.938
You know what I'm talking about,
right, Chair?

10:22.980 --> 10:23.970
[bell rings]

10:24.012 --> 10:27.865
All Meal is over. Stop eating.
Everyone upstairs.

10:27.907 --> 10:31.135
Garfield.

10:37.130 --> 10:40.018
What the hell are
you doing here, Celine?

10:40.060 --> 10:44.019
My name is Chair now.

Hey!
-Garfield, come with me.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.902
Yes, Ma'am.
-No!

this instant,

11:45.814 --> 11:46.271
Hello?

11:46.313 --> 11:48.635
(Hortense)
Helen Keller is
coming to visit me!

11:48.677 --> 11:51.165
Oh, I haven't been this excited
since Lillian's birthday was

11:51.207 --> 11:55.733
the same day as the World's Fair
and nobody came to her party.

11:58.233 --> 12:02.126
Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan.

Why is she doing that
with her hands?

12:12.782 --> 12:17.840
Is she an Italian? -She's speaking
and listening with her hands.

12:20.572 --> 12:23.460
Wow.

12:23.502 --> 12:26.796
She says hi.

12:30.194 --> 12:32.915
Beatrice, stop staring.

12:32.957 --> 12:34.048
What? Sorry, what?

12:34.090 --> 12:38.009
You fell asleep with
your eyes open again.

12:38.051 --> 12:41.672
Helen would like to thank Hortense
for her financial contribution

12:41.714 --> 12:44.201
to our women's
suffragette movement.

12:44.243 --> 12:46.033
Oh.

12:46.075 --> 12:48.264
Well, to me suffrage
isn't...

12:48.306 --> 12:49.695
Haven't women suffered enough?

12:49.737 --> 12:52.592
I mean, we're already inferior
to men in every way.

12:52.634 --> 12:56.854
Lillian, suffrage is
the right to vote.

12:56.896 --> 12:59.550
Vote! Would we
have to do it every day?

12:59.592 --> 13:01.614
If women can vote, who's next?

13:01.656 --> 13:05.077
Horses? Tulips? Beatrice?!

(Dodo)
Whilst my daughters were
socializing,

13:13.742 --> 13:15.797
I decided to slip away
for a little me time.

13:15.839 --> 13:20.059
You are to give Lady Bellacourt
10 cc's of morphine exactly.

13:20.101 --> 13:23.821
Not a drop more or,
God forbid, a drop less.

13:23.863 --> 13:26.584
We need to achieve
the perfect balance

13:26.626 --> 13:30.813
between hallucination
and death.

13:30.855 --> 13:32.044
Do you have a clean needle?

13:32.086 --> 13:33.842
(Peepers)
Oh, what's wrong with
this needle?

13:33.884 --> 13:35.807
It worked perfectly well
yesterday.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.071
Ah.

13:38.113 --> 13:40.734
Oh, the pain!

13:40.776 --> 13:41.566
The pain!

13:41.608 --> 13:45.935
Oh, quit your jibber jabbering
and prick her.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.456
[Dodo moans]

13:50.498 --> 13:54.018

13:54.893 --> 13:59.685
I think my husband, the
Commodore, is having an affair.

14:00.053 --> 14:04.406
You have such lovely
alabaster skin, Chair.

14:04.448 --> 14:07.069
I wish I had skin like that.

14:07.111 --> 14:13.628

Moorish village, and now I'm Latin.

14:13.670 --> 14:16.192

14:16.234 --> 14:20.460
No, it's Chair, like a chair.
But my name.

14:25.856 --> 14:29.076
I don't get it.
Why wouldn't you want to see?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.175
I like seeing.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.938
It's not that she doesn't want
to see, it's that she can't see.

14:32.980 --> 14:35.402
Well, is she looking
through her eyes?

14:35.444 --> 14:38.838
Go back to sleep.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.761
The Marquis de Sainsbury
has arrived.

14:41.803 --> 14:44.058
What? He's early! -I haven't
burned my freckles off yet.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.821
Blanche, put a sheet
over the blind girl, now!

14:47.863 --> 14:49.485

14:49.527 --> 14:51.783
Hello. I can't tell you
how pleased I am to make

14:51.825 --> 14:53.913
your acquaintance, Marquis.
-Good morning, Your Highness.

14:53.955 --> 14:57.442
I'm sorry that I'm early, but I
like to catch people off guard.

14:57.484 --> 14:59.673
I'm the great
Marquis de Sainsbury,

14:59.715 --> 15:02.370
the arbiter of who's who
in Newport society.

15:02.412 --> 15:04.068
Now, with all this new money,

15:04.110 --> 15:05.899
it's my job to separate
the elite

15:05.941 --> 15:07.896
from the almost rich
vomit people.

15:07.938 --> 15:10.160
Good figs,
is that Helen Keller?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.493

-Why didn't you tell me

15:11.535 --> 15:15.254
you had the most famous woman
in America here?

15:15.296 --> 15:15.854
Her?!

15:15.896 --> 15:18.051
The great tragedy
is that you cannot see

15:18.093 --> 15:20.914
the magnificent beauty with
which God has bestowed you.

15:20.956 --> 15:22.846
Wait, you speak that
dumb hand language, too?

I'm the Marquis de Sainsbury.
I speak all the languages.

I mean, how hard could it be?

15:42.097 --> 15:43.820

being deaf and blind

15:43.862 --> 15:49.846

Well, since we have such an
esteemed guest staying with us,

16:13.560 --> 16:15.382
why don't we bring out
the cocaine wine?

16:15.424 --> 16:16.481
Well, that sounds exotic.

16:16.523 --> 16:19.577

married cocaine and wine?

the Women's Temperance League,

16:26.545 --> 16:28.400
so no wine for us, thank you.

16:28.442 --> 16:30.398
Don't worry.
It's mostly cocaine.

but it also is, in an essence,
my bath time.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.672
I get to wash my hands.

16:51.714 --> 16:56.300
Oh, Garfield, sometimes I feel
as though I have nothing.
