<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.743

00:09.776 --> 00:12.679

01:18.812 --> 01:23.683
   Hey, Zack, see that girl?
   She's about to
   become my woman.

01:23.717 --> 01:27.220
   What are you gonna do?
   Shoot her with a stun gun?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.757
 No, I'm gonna use
 the old Screech charm.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.297
  - Hi, Molly.
  - Hi.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.132
Beat it!

01:39.165 --> 01:41.935
 I can do that.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.743
 What happened?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.011
   The usual.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
The bully gets the girl,
I get the locker.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.614
  Oh.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.387
   All right,
   everyone, listen up,
   'cause I have great news.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.656
   Madonna's the new
   school nurse?

02:03.690 --> 02:07.193
  No. Bayside has been chosen
  to host a pilot program

02:07.227 --> 02:09.095
   for the California
   Cadet Corps.

02:09.128 --> 02:13.066
 Now, I'd like to introduce
 to you Lieutenant Chet Adams.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.335
   ( wolf whistles )

02:15.368 --> 02:16.870
   Lisa, what are you doing?

02:16.903 --> 02:19.105
I can't help it.
He is so hot.

02:19.139 --> 02:25.245
 Are you all right, young lady?
 Yes, Lieutenant Hot.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.948
   In the Cadet Corps,
   we initiate students into
   the Army way of life.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.685
 Naturally, there's discipline,
 hard work involved.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.887
 No, thank you.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.121
   Excuse me?

02:35.155 --> 02:38.258
 Every school has one.
 He's ours.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.361
  As I was saying,
  there's also career training

02:41.394 --> 02:43.396
   and a chance
   for college scholarships.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.299
  I hope you'll
  sign up and see what
  you can be in today's Army.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.401
   Why aren't women
   allowed on the front line?

02:48.435 --> 02:51.237
- Because we need cooks.
- Boys: Yeah!

02:52.872 --> 02:54.974
   In the United States Army,
   women are second to none

02:55.008 --> 02:58.111
as far as intelligence,
stamina and courage.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.213
  - Kelly: All right.
  - Girls: Yeah!

03:00.246 --> 03:02.682
 I hope I'll be seeing
 some of you soon.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.617
  Oh, you will, honey.

03:07.087 --> 03:10.056
   - Thank you, Mr. Belding.
   - Thank you, Lieutenant.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.159
Any volunteers?

03:14.127 --> 03:16.796
   Count me in, Mr. Belding.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.100
   Count me out, Mr. Belding.

03:20.133 --> 03:24.871
You're out, all right.
My office, five minutes.

03:28.074 --> 03:32.278
  This is it, Morris.
  The end. <i>El finito.</i>

03:32.312 --> 03:35.148
I am fed up with
your wisecracks.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.984
 I am giving you
 a month's worth
 of Saturday detention.

03:38.084 --> 03:42.155
 - Four Saturdays?
 - Uh-uh, 30 Saturdays!

03:42.188 --> 03:45.158
 30 Saturdays?!
 Sir, can we negotiate?

03:45.191 --> 03:46.826
Hey, I'll wash your car.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.195
   The last time
   you washed my car,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.865
you flooded the inside.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.267
 Carpool, sir.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.404
- Hold on.
- Holding, sir.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.073
 Maybe there is
 something you can do.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.909
 I want to see this Cadet Corps
 succeed here.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.445
   So if you sign up,
   no detention.

04:05.478 --> 04:08.715
  You mean all I have to do is
  join that Mickey Mouse Army?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.951
   That's right.
   That and one other
   little request...

04:12.052 --> 04:13.787
  we need a full class
  for the program,

04:13.820 --> 04:16.488
 so it's your job to get them.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.426
   All right, you got a deal,
   Mr. Belding.

04:21.161 --> 04:25.732
 Either he's getting real old,
 or I'm getting really good.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.734
   Why should I join
   the Cadet Corps?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.403
   Because the new Army
   serves cake at every meal.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.472
  Slice me in!

04:36.242 --> 04:39.112
   Louise, the Army's
   a good place for
   a girl like you.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.181
 Zack, the Army is not for me.

04:41.214 --> 04:45.852
 You may not believe this,
 but I am a non-violent person.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.922
Well, there's three guys
for every girl.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.091
  I could learn to be violent.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.560
Hii-ya!

04:53.593 --> 04:57.364
 I take that as a yes,
 Rambette?

04:57.397 --> 04:59.199
 - Hey, Butch.
 - Hey!

04:59.232 --> 05:01.034
 Don't touch me
 or you're shark spit.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.470
 If you join the Corps,
 you can beat up
 anybody you want,

05:03.503 --> 05:05.238
and not get in trouble.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.208
   - Hey, that sounds
   choice, Zack.
   - All right.

05:11.878 --> 05:15.148
 I can't believe you signed up
 for this macho cadet crock.

05:15.181 --> 05:19.285
 Hey, my Dad's been in the Army
 and served
 proudly for 25 years.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.889
 You know, Slater, women really
 don't belong in the Army.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.090
 Slater: Right.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.892
  You heard what
  the lieutenant said.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.560
He said we're
as qualified as any man.

05:27.594 --> 05:31.064
  Oh yeah? Then why don't you
  sign up and prove it?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.133
   Hey, you don't
   have to take that.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.170
   All right, bubba, I'm in.
   And in fact, so is Kelly.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.205
 - Why am I in?
 - Why?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.207
 Because we women
 should stick together.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.277
 Yeah! And your father
 has seven children,

05:44.310 --> 05:48.248
 and the lieutenant
 said you can win
 college scholarships.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.950
Okay, I'll do it. Lisa?

05:50.984 --> 05:54.921
  I will waste
  any girl who comes
  near my commanding officer.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.495
 Hey, this is great.
 All I need is one more sucker.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.271
 - Hi.
 - Bye.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.373
   Hey, Screech, pal.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.342
 You wanna know how
 you can get that girl?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.044
  By being a real man.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.046
- Me?
- That's right.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.049
Wait till Molly sees you
in a uniform.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.558
   Atten-hut!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.466
At ease.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.071
   You are wonderful,
   General Screech.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.507
  Troops, when I came
  into the Corps

06:47.540 --> 06:49.409
 I was weak, pathetic,
 and lily-livered.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.911
Yeah, and you still are!

06:55.315 --> 06:59.319
- On your feet, soldier.
- No way, dork.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.922
 Hey! It's General Dork to you.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.428
   Attention!

07:08.461 --> 07:12.098
 Prepare to hold hands.
 Give him 10.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.200
 One, two, three, four,

07:14.234 --> 07:17.537
   five, six, seven,
   eight, nine, 10!

07:19.305 --> 07:21.408
I'll be all the Screech
that I can be.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.309
Ow! Ah!

07:31.584 --> 07:34.287
  - You in here, too?
  - Yeah.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.690
   Welcome. Maybe we can
   share a foxhole sometime.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.224
   ( growls )

07:39.726 --> 07:42.495
 Hi, guys. Do you think
 the lieutenant
 will like me in this?

07:42.529 --> 07:46.299
   Whoa!
   I think when he sees you,
   his helmet will melt.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.469
 I hope I can
 handle this, so I have
 a chance at that scholarship.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.439
   Stop worrying. Would I be
   in this class if
   it weren't a snap?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.308
  Well, nice to see
  such a good turnout.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.477
   I want you guys to relax,
   enjoy yourselves

07:57.510 --> 07:59.346
and I'm sure we're gonna
have a great time.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.215
  - Great.
  - What'd I tell you?
  Piece of cake.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.150
 ( bell rings )

08:05.118 --> 08:06.519
Ten-hut!

08:06.553 --> 08:09.255
 Maybe I wasn't clear.
 On your feet!

08:14.227 --> 08:15.261
   Now men...

08:15.295 --> 08:18.331
Pardon me,
don't you mean persons?

08:19.566 --> 08:23.536
   I guess not. Yeah.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.405
   Cadet Corps
   is now in session.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.674
   There will be no talking,

08:27.707 --> 08:31.311
no smiling, no blinking

08:31.344 --> 08:33.346
and no chewing.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.616
   - But I always
   chew gum in class.
   - You do?

08:36.649 --> 08:38.083
  Yes.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.318
 Make that gum history.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.288
   ( gulps )

08:42.322 --> 08:44.457
What's with the uniform?

08:44.491 --> 08:47.360
  I hope he is not
  like this on a date!

08:47.394 --> 08:49.763
  Hey, lighten up, Lieutenant,
  there's no war.

08:49.796 --> 08:53.400
  Haven't you heard?
Peace broke out
  all over the world.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.435
  Oh, I remember you.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.504
   Big mouth.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.441
 - Down and give me 20.
 - How about two
 fives and a 10?

09:03.009 --> 09:05.011
 - How about 50?
 - Come on, Lieutenant.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.514
  - Where's the fun and games?
  - It's gonna be
  plenty of fun...

09:07.547 --> 09:11.484
 for me.
 Make that 100!

09:11.518 --> 09:13.553
  Sir, I can't do
  that many push-ups.

09:13.586 --> 09:17.157
   That's okay.
   I have all day
   to watch you try.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.128
  I wonder if he takes money?

09:22.162 --> 09:24.564
  Three, four, five...

09:27.767 --> 09:29.302
   Forget it, Morris.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.438
  But, sir, I don't
  belong in the Corps.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.340
   Sorry, you agreed.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.875
  You are not
  my headache anymore.

09:35.909 --> 09:40.313
 All right,
 if you must know, sir,
 I'm a bad American,

09:40.347 --> 09:42.549
   not worthy of my uniform.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.885
 Did you hear what I just said?
 You are not my headache.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.389
   I feel wonderful.

09:51.391 --> 09:55.762
   The Army is my Tylenol,
   and my Zack-ache is gone.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.337
   Good morning, Lisa, Kelly.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.340
 How could it be good?
 Look at the way I am dressed!

10:07.374 --> 10:09.342
   I think you look terrific.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.012
   I'm beginning
   to love the Army!

10:12.045 --> 10:13.613
 I hope I haven't been
 too rough on you.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.915
  Are you kidding? Compared
  to my three older brothers,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.650
 you're a wuss!

10:20.720 --> 10:23.390
  Looks like you've been
  working out, Cadet Screech.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.425
 It's scary how quickly
 I'm developing, sir.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.994
   - Scares me.
   - ( air hissing )

10:31.531 --> 10:34.968
   Look what
   happens when you stop
   pumping iron for one day.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.674
   Why aren't you in uniform,
   Cadet Morris?

10:40.707 --> 10:42.942
  Well, let's face it, sir.
  I'm just not Corps material.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.412
  I think it's best
  for both of us if I resign.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.515
   That's too bad,
   because I had
   big plans for you.

10:48.548 --> 10:52.719
 I'm afraid my arms can't take
 anymore of your
 big plans, sir.

10:52.752 --> 10:56.823
 You're a born leader.
 I'd hate to lose you.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.591
  How about I make you a deal?

10:58.625 --> 11:01.094
   Oh yeah?
   What kind of deal?

11:01.127 --> 11:03.430
We're gonna have
an athletic competition,

11:03.463 --> 11:06.733
  and I was
  thinking of making you
  captain of one of the teams.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.704
  Well, that's very nice, sir,
  but where's the deal?

11:11.871 --> 11:14.941
 If your team wins,
 I'll let you out of the Corps.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.377
And even better,

11:17.410 --> 11:20.547
you can pick the teams.
Do we have a deal?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.782
Pick the teams?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.851
   Yes, sir.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.724
Who does this guy
think he's dealing with?

11:31.858 --> 11:34.094
 The highlight of every
 Cadet Corps program

11:34.094 --> 11:35.962
  is an athletic competition.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.698
   This helps develop
   physical skills, teamwork,

11:38.732 --> 11:41.868
and it's the Army's way
of separating
the men from the boys.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.670
   Excuse me?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.939
   - The persons
   from the persons.
   - Thank you.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.942
  Now, there'll be a Red Team
  and a Blue Team.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.478
   Choice of colors all right
   with you, Miss Spano?

11:51.511 --> 11:56.416
  - Yes. But it's Ms.
  - Oh, right.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.818
 Now, I've already picked
 the leaders for the two teams,

11:58.852 --> 12:01.054
   AC Slater and Zack Morris.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.490
I've given Cadet Morris
the responsibility

12:03.523 --> 12:04.791
 of choosing the teams.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.794
  All right, we'll start first
  with the Red Team.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.963
 When I call your name,
 step forward.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.599
 Alan, Screech,

12:12.632 --> 12:14.734
 Lisa, Louise.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.407
   Okay, you guys are
   with Slater.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.908
 What?!

12:21.941 --> 12:25.412
 Jessie,
 Kelly, Butch, and Rocco
 are with me on the Blue Team.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.514
  Let the games begin!

12:27.547 --> 12:29.783
   Wait a second.
   That's not fair. He's got
   all the jocks, Lieutenant.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.419
 Wait a second.
 I am not a jock, okay?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.888
   So what!
   You're on a team of hunks.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.890
 Are these teams
 evenly matched, Cadet Morris?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.092
They certainly are, sir.
If anything,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.627
   Slater has the advantage.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.163
Yeah? For what,
the Nerd Bowl?

12:43.196 --> 12:46.833
  - Are you sure this is fair?
  - Sir, you have my word.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.735
  Well, good.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.137
   Zack,
   you'll lead the Red Team,
   Slater, the Blue Team.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.006
   But...
   but, sir, you said I could
   pick the teams.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.941
I know,
and you did a fine job.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.478
But I pick the leaders.
That's my job.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.782
Pretty good at his job,
huh, Zack?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.653
 Left, left, left, right, left.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.422
 Company halt!

13:09.456 --> 13:11.124
   Left face!

13:13.693 --> 13:15.729
Good soldiering,
Cadet Slater.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.666
Thank you, sir.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.735
Okay, Blue Team.
Ready?

13:21.768 --> 13:24.604
  Right face.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.706
 Forward march.

13:26.740 --> 13:31.077
 Left, left, left, right, left.
 Left...

13:31.077 --> 13:34.214
 Zack:
 Left, left, left, right, left.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.083
 Company halt.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.519
   Alan, I said halt!

13:39.552 --> 13:42.088
I thought you said malt.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.191
  And I'm thirsty
  from all this moving about.

13:45.225 --> 13:50.096
 Will you get off my back?
 Now I have to burn my clothes.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.867
 All right, team.
 Let's get it together.
 Come on.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.704
  About face!

13:57.737 --> 14:02.542
 Alan, I am not a cake,
 so please, get out of my face.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.745
 You guys are hopeless!
 Turn around!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.182
 - All right, Blue Team ready?
 - Ready!

14:09.215 --> 14:10.450
  Go!

14:12.686 --> 14:14.688
   All right, let's go, guys!
   Hustle, hustle, hustle!

14:14.721 --> 14:16.923
   Move it, move it, move it.
   All right!

14:16.956 --> 14:20.060
 Yeah! Right on, Butch!
 Right on, man!

14:20.093 --> 14:22.662
 Okay, guys. Let's do something
 right this time, all right?

14:22.696 --> 14:26.232
   - Let's go, guys.
   - Red Team ready?

14:26.266 --> 14:27.701
  Go!

14:31.738 --> 14:35.642
  - That's great, just great!
  - Thanks to you, Zack.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.211
  I am never gonna win
  with a bunch of
  losers like you.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.081
 You guys are the clumsiest
 bunch of goofs I've ever seen,

14:41.114 --> 14:42.716
  and I quit!

14:51.358 --> 14:53.993
  Zack, you gotta come back.
   We don't
  stand a chance without you.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.763
  Forget it, Screech.
  I don't wanna waste my time.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.098
   But we're getting better.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.735
 Alan even got his uniform off
 without ripping it.

15:01.768 --> 15:05.739
- Big deal.
- I don't get it, Zack.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.541
  You're the one who talked us
  into joining the Corps.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.411
  And now you're quitting just
  because you're not
  on the best team?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.847
  Yeah, that's about it.
  Because the Corps is stupid.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.316
You said the Corps would
make me the kind of man
Molly would want.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.419
   So I lied. Sue me.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.054
You know, Zack,

15:21.054 --> 15:23.890
  ever since we were little...

15:23.923 --> 15:25.792
 I've looked up to you.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
  You had everything.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.299
I always wanted
to be like you.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.669
 Now, I'm glad I'm not.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.675
   Okay, tuggers, get ready,

15:41.708 --> 15:44.511
   set, tug!

15:54.587 --> 15:55.789
 Ahem!

15:55.822 --> 15:57.624
  What are you
  doing here, Morris?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.026
   Rejoining my team
   with your permission, sir.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.862
   That's impossible, Morris.
   You're a quitter.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.931
 The Corps
 doesn't want quitters.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.468
  I want another chance.
  Please let me back in, sir.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.070
  That's not for me to decide.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.806
Maybe they don't
want you back.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.612
All right,
I let all you guys down,
and I called you losers.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
 You know what?
 I was wrong.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.651
  The only real loser
  on this team was me.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.822
  Screech, I'm sorry.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.057
   Guys, please take me back.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.062
 We'll have to talk this over.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.064
  Let's put
  our heads together.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.066
  Ohh!

16:43.837 --> 16:47.741
Look, guys, I think
we need him desperately.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.077
 - Welcome back, buddy.
 - All right!

16:51.111 --> 16:53.747
 Come on,
 we don't have much time.
 Let's get to work. Right here.

16:53.780 --> 16:54.681
 Come on! Yeah!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.385
All right,
before we begin
the competition,

16:58.418 --> 17:02.088
I want the team captains
to come forward
and shake hands.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.025
   - May the best squad win.
   - Don't worry, we will.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.560
 Yeah, Louise!

17:07.594 --> 17:09.529
  - Okay!
  - ( whistle blows )

17:09.561 --> 17:11.564
  All right, go for it, Mama.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.500
  Okay, Papa.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.604
 - Go!
 - All right, Mama, go!

17:17.637 --> 17:19.939
Just keep going!
Don't even think.
You got it! You got it!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.742
   - You got it! You got it!
   - Kelly: Come on, Jessie!
   Come on!

17:22.776 --> 17:24.877
  Come on, you got it!
  You're jammin' now.
  You're jammin'.

17:24.911 --> 17:28.882
  All right, all right. Yeah!
  All right, you did it! Yeah!

17:28.915 --> 17:30.417
 Nine seconds!

17:30.450 --> 17:31.918
  ( cheering )

17:32.952 --> 17:34.187
 Nine seconds?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.924
 I can't even get to the bottom
 of my purse in nine seconds.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.959
 All right, just remember
 what I taught you, all right?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.928
You can do it. Come on.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.963
   - Come on, Lisa.
   - Screech: Let's go, Lisa!

17:44.064 --> 17:45.832
 - Red Team, let's go!
 - Let's go!

17:45.865 --> 17:47.567
 Ready?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.870
 - Go!
 - Go, Lisa!
 Let's go, Lisa! Lisa!

17:50.904 --> 17:53.573
 Woo!
 She's partying around!

17:54.574 --> 17:57.644
- Four seconds!
- Yeah, Lisa!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.713
 - One point for the Red Team!
 - Yes!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.581
- Way to go, Lisa.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.817
 - By the way, are you married?
 - By the way, yes.

18:03.850 --> 18:07.687
   By the way, <i>adios.</i>

18:07.721 --> 18:10.156
Okay, guys, let's go.
We'll get
them in the rope climb.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.925
All right, yes!

18:12.025 --> 18:14.828
 All right,
 now, Slater's strong,
 but you're quick.

18:14.861 --> 18:18.565
Yeah, I'm a human dart.
I'll take this clown.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.902
   - Suck my dust, Slater.
   - All right, Louise, yeah!

18:24.504 --> 18:27.440
   Ready? Go!

18:27.474 --> 18:30.710
   - Go, Louise!
   - ( all shouting )

18:30.744 --> 18:34.047
Go, Louise!
Up, Louise! Up!

18:34.047 --> 18:36.449
 - One point for the Blue Team.
 - ( cheering )

18:36.483 --> 18:39.052
   Now we're rolling.
   Let's hit that
   obstacle course.

18:39.085 --> 18:43.256
   At least I came in second.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.692
 Ready to be humiliated, wimp?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.794
 Hey, I'm always ready.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.496
  - Ready?
  - Rocco: You Got it, Butch!

18:49.529 --> 18:51.131
   Slater: You got it, Butch!
   Just hustle!

18:51.164 --> 18:54.100
   - Go!
   - Go, Screech, go, go, go!

18:54.134 --> 18:57.804
Yeah! Right on!
Right on, Butch!

18:59.673 --> 19:01.875
For this exercise
in hand-to-hand combat,

19:01.908 --> 19:06.012
you will have to subdue
the very mean
fighting machine,

19:06.012 --> 19:08.915
  the awesome, Beldo!

19:12.152 --> 19:15.021
   I am one bad dude.

19:15.055 --> 19:17.824
 - Slater: Go, Kelly!
 - Don't worry, Kelly.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.160
  I'll go easy on you.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.195
  - Go Kelly!
  - Ready?

19:22.228 --> 19:24.197
   - Go!
   - Come on, Kelly!

19:24.230 --> 19:26.833
Mr. Belding,
could we switch sticks?
Mine doesn't feel right.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.136
 - Sure, Kelly.
 - Never mind.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.505
  Kelly Kapowski, man!

19:32.539 --> 19:35.608
  Six seconds!
  Diverting the enemy.
  Good tactic.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.043
  Yes!

19:37.043 --> 19:40.847
- Louise: Come on, Zack!
- ( cheering )

19:40.880 --> 19:43.049
 I've been waiting
 for this day, Morris.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.653
   This one's for
   you and your sweet
   little girlfriend, Kelly.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.856
 Ready?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.257
  - Go!
  - Hi, Mrs. Belding.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.326
My wife's here?

19:56.062 --> 19:58.598
 One second!
 A new record!

19:58.631 --> 20:02.802
- ( Red Team cheering )
- Pathetic, Beldo.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.706
   We're all tied up.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.908
  Whichever team wins
  the tug-of-war
  is our champion.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.945
 - Tuggers ready?
 - Yes. Come on, guys.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.146
   - Tug!
   - All right, pull!

20:13.179 --> 20:14.748
   Zack: Come on, guys, pull!

20:14.781 --> 20:17.784
   Yeah! Go, guys, go, guys.
   Come on, guys.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.753
 - Over here!
 - Come on, guys, pull!

20:19.786 --> 20:20.954
  - Over here!
  - Let's go!

20:24.224 --> 20:27.027
Since the rope broke,
this is
the tie-breaking event,

20:27.060 --> 20:30.196
   the Super Obstacle Course.
   Each team will
   choose one man...

20:30.230 --> 20:32.899
  I mean, one person,
  to compete.

20:32.932 --> 20:37.170
   - Very good, Lieutenant.
   - I'm trying, Cadet Spano.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.206
  - Now, Butch,
  this is your event.
  - Yeah.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.075
  - Bring it on home.
  - All right.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.677
  ( grunting )

20:43.710 --> 20:45.979
  Well, Morris,
  here's your chance.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.014
If your team wins,
you're out of the Corps.

20:48.048 --> 20:49.916
  A free man.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.819
- Guys.
- Zack,
Butch is running again.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.688
  You're the only one
  who can beat him.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.056
- Yeah.
- Nope.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.924
   There's someone else here
   who can beat him.

20:57.957 --> 21:02.228
   - Who?
   - Screech.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.899
  Are you crazy?!
  You saw what
  happened last time.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.867
   Yeah, I can't beat Butch.
   We'll lose.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.202
Not if you win.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.772
 Come on,
 Screech, it's time you
 started believing in yourself.

21:12.806 --> 21:16.409
 - Runners,
 take your positions.
 - You got it, Butch! It's you!

21:18.745 --> 21:21.247
All right, Screech!
You can do it! Come on!

21:21.281 --> 21:23.750
 - Let's go, Screech.
 - Red Team, let's go!

21:23.783 --> 21:25.685
( all cheering )

21:26.853 --> 21:28.455
 Ready?

21:28.488 --> 21:29.889
  Go!

21:29.923 --> 21:32.425
( all cheering )

22:03.123 --> 22:06.292
 Screech, yes!

22:06.326 --> 22:08.428
All right, little buddy!
Great going!

22:08.461 --> 22:12.165
 - I won?
 - You were wonderful!

22:12.198 --> 22:15.335
- Does that
answer your question?
- I won?! I really won?!

22:15.368 --> 22:17.404
 I can't believe I lost to you.

22:17.437 --> 22:21.207
 Maybe next time, you should
 pick on a wimp your own size.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.879
   Nice work, Morris.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.981
   Personally, I didn't think
   you stood a chance.

22:28.081 --> 22:30.417
   Thank you, sir. You didn't
   give me much of a choice.

22:30.450 --> 22:34.187
You got what you wanted,
Morris.
I guess this is goodbye.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.457
 - Why, sir? Are you quitting?
 - Not me.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.192
Not me, either.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.529
   Someone told me the Corps
   doesn't like a quitter.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.173
  ( instrumental music plays )
