06:58.374 --> 07:00.855
So have you written
any more jokes?

07:00.898 --> 07:03.640
No. I don't want to be

You want to show me?

11:08.842 --> 11:10.800
-Let's see yours.
-All right.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.927
Tough little cunt, aren't you?

14:52.239 --> 14:54.937
Oh, I got a tip-off
about Vinnie.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.939
Now, it could be all bullshit,

14:56.983 --> 14:59.202
but I got a name.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.943
Who?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.990

15:05.252 --> 15:06.993
Ray Shoestring?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.647
Ray Shoestring.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.085
-Ray Shoestring.
-Yeah.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.434
You ever heard of him?

15:13.477 --> 15:16.176
Doesn't ring any bells.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.047
Who gave you the tip?

15:18.091 --> 15:20.528
I don't know.
Just a phone call.

15:20.571 --> 15:23.226
-So what you want to do?

15:23.270 --> 15:25.228
Don't know.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.230
I'll make some calls,
ask around, eh?

15:27.274 --> 15:29.189
Yeah, right.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.234
Do you want me to look into it?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.671
Nah, I'll take care of it.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.064
I'll bet you fucking will.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.371
What are you doing?

15:56.825 --> 15:58.131
Well done, Ray.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.222
So you want to drive?

16:02.265 --> 16:04.398
Yeah.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.200
-Let me ask you a question.
-RAY: Mm.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.248

17:29.265 --> 17:31.006
So, what do youse want?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.573
-Huh?
-Well, I want you to die.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.227
I mean how much do you want?

17:34.270 --> 17:35.706
How much do we want for what?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.143
To let me slide.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.232
Shit, I don't know.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.277
-How much do you want, Raymond?-

17:41.321 --> 17:43.279
I don't know, man.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.325
How much you got?

17:45.368 --> 17:46.804
$650K, give or take.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.241
-DAVE: Really?
-Yeah.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.243
-DAVE: Where?
-It's buried.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.549
It's, uh, four duffel bags,
filled to the brim.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.725
-All clean. What are you doing?-So what's that splitbetween two?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.118

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
-You happy with that, Ray?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.171
Not particularly.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.131
You're not happy with $325,000?

18:09.175 --> 18:12.352
Well, normally,
I would be, mate, but, uh,

18:12.395 --> 18:15.485
your guys killed my fucking dog.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.009
Okay, I am sorry about that.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.229
I didn't tell 'em to do it.
I have a dog.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.405
-I love dogs.-As long as you're sorry, mate.

18:22.449 --> 18:25.016
I am sorry.
I mean that. I do.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.017
So where's this money?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.149
Maroota.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.629
Where in Maroota?

18:29.847 --> 18:31.806
How do I know
you're gonna let me go?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.286
'Cause we're just telling you
we'll let you go.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.852
Well, I need
a bit more than that.

18:34.896 --> 18:35.984
DAVE:
Oh, do you? You know what,

18:36.027 --> 18:37.203
-fuck this.
-RAY: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.378
-Don't shoot him.
-Why not?

18:38.421 --> 18:39.814
Just throw him in the water,
mate. That's why I put

18:39.857 --> 18:41.598
the bloody cuffs on his ankles.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.600
: Right.
So we just...

18:43.644 --> 18:45.385
we just drown the cunt.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.300
Push him in.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.172
DAVE:
Where's the money?

18:50.216 --> 18:53.523
Well... how do I know
you're not gonna kill me here?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.177
Oh, fuck.
We're going around in circles.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.309
What do you want to do?

18:56.352 --> 18:57.745
That's a lot of money.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.225
Mate, what do you want us to do?

18:59.268 --> 19:00.835
Well, I got...

19:00.878 --> 19:03.751
I just can't
take your word for it, Ray.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.579
Well, that's all we got, mate.
So if you don't believe us,

19:05.622 --> 19:07.015
I don't know
what to fucking tell you.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.671
Okay.
How about this?

19:10.714 --> 19:13.195
We go to Maroota, right?

19:13.239 --> 19:15.023
-Right, right? Good.
-Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.242
So, we get there, yeah?

19:16.285 --> 19:18.331
When we get there,
you park the car.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.333
I get out. You guys...
We all get out

19:20.376 --> 19:22.422
-of the car.
I stay at the car.
-Fuck me.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.902
I point you in the direction
of-of-of where the money is,

19:24.946 --> 19:26.252
and you guys-you guys-you guys
walk over,

19:26.295 --> 19:28.341
-you go get it.
-And then what?

19:28.384 --> 19:30.256
Then, when you get to the spot,

19:30.299 --> 19:32.649
then I'll-I'll start
walking off.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.698
Do we look
like a couple of fuckwits?

19:39.308 --> 19:40.309
Hmm?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.919
Okay.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.226
How about you get there,
you dig it up.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.793
The money's...
the money's in a bag, yeah?

19:45.836 --> 19:47.098
You dig up the bag.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.448
-You get the bags...
-You-you know what,

19:48.491 --> 19:49.666
this is what's
fucking gonna happen.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.321
All right?
We'll stay by the car.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
You know where the money is,
so you can toddle off

19:54.323 --> 19:55.411
and you dig up the bags.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.152
-Right?
-Yeah.
-Yes.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.458
-Yeah?
-RAY: Yeah.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.894
-DAVE: Yeah? Can we go?
-Yeah. We... Yeah.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.939
We stay at the car.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.639
-That's not gonna work either.
-Why?

20:05.682 --> 20:08.381
What if he's got a fucking gun
in one of the bags?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.599
Oh, fuck.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.340
All right, here's what's
gonna happen, all right?

20:11.384 --> 20:12.298
We stay at the car.

20:12.341 --> 20:13.734
-You go back out there...
-No, no, no.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.475
-Uh...
-No, he stays by the car.
-Okay.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.041
You stay... He stays by the car.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.391
I know what I meant to say,
right?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.393
I know what I meant to say.
He stays by the car.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.482
-Mm.
-Right? We go out there

20:22.525 --> 20:24.527
and we dig up the bags, right?

20:24.571 --> 20:26.529
Make sure the money's all there.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.749
And then I'll give you a signal,right?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.446
Make sure everything's okay.
And then--

20:30.490 --> 20:32.535
and then, only then--

20:32.579 --> 20:33.536
he can go.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.885
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.670
Mm. Mm.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.541
Is that-is that...
Yeah?

20:38.585 --> 20:40.195
-That's it. Yeah.
-S-Signal?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.196
-Yeah.

Oh, you...

20:58.126 --> 21:00.563
-In you go.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.478
I don't want to sound
like a pain in the ass,

21:02.522 --> 21:04.480
but can I just ride in the car
with you guys?

21:04.524 --> 21:06.134
Absolutely not.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.788
Come on.
I suffer from claustrophobia.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.485
You're gonna suffer
