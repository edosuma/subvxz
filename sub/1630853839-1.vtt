00:27.945 --> 00:32.783
Soobesükütsa tüa
pia mupitsI ikÜ kimai.

00:34.326 --> 00:39.748
A long time ago, it is said,
a monster came here.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.282
A white tail.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.458
Sarii.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.586
Mahoinitü.

05:58.984 --> 06:03.154
I remember when
Father told me I was ready for kühtaamia.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.739
My big hunt.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.744
You were little.
So, Mother took you to gather medicine.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.082
But Father and I,
we went up into the hills.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.335
The rain was bad. Everything was wet.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.963
We crawled through the mud
and my bowstring…

06:20.046 --> 06:21.381
-…got ruined and--

06:26.428 --> 06:28.680
-You were sleeping.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.725
I was waiting for it to circle back.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.311
Now you're gonna have to
cross the river to get it.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.229
Whoa.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.023
Don't get your bowstring wet.

06:39.858 --> 06:40.942
Taabe,

06:41.818 --> 06:43.486
this morning in the sky,

06:44.029 --> 06:46.823
I saw a sign. The thunderbird.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.993
I've been practicing.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.829
It's time. I'm ready for my kühtaamia.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.915
You really think you're ready?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.753
You wanna hunt something
that's hunting you?

08:55.744 --> 08:57.162
Petsü.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.962
-Trained him well.
-It's easy. He's smart.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.256
Not every smart creature is easy to train.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.429
-Is that for War Chief's bad knee?
-Mmm.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.348
He's getting worse.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.976
You didn't put orange totsiyaa.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.566
Who taught you about orange totsiyaa?

09:27.358 --> 09:28.526
You.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.278
Hmm.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.165
Your father left you that
to cut breadroot with.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.961
I almost got a deer with it.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.672
Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost."

09:50.799 --> 09:55.053
My girl, you are good
at so many other things.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.222
Why do you want to hunt?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.850
Because you all think that I can't.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.690
Ah!

10:07.774 --> 10:10.401
In this wind, he brings home a red-tail.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.822
You should have listened to my story.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.825
Didn't think we had time for a nap.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.036
Posa.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.040
It's sharp enough.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.377
Go get us some orange totsiyaa.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.212
Itsee.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.174
-Hina?
-A lion. It took Puhi.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.342
We gotta find him.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.943
You could get shot sneaking up like that.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.655
-Who's sneaking?

13:00.738 --> 13:01.990
Who invited you?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.451
We won't be gone long enough
to need a cook.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.330
She should stay.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.748
She tracks well.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.543
And if we find Puhi alive,
she knows medicine.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.467
You have to find that cat now.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.219
-I will.
-I know.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.263
'Cause you have to.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.207
Oh, good. The dog found shit.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.418
-We're not looking for wolves.
-It's not wolf.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.045
You see that crushed bone?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.255
That's lion scat.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.258
And the cat that made it was big.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.376
He's breathing.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.378
Petsü.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.009
So much could kill him.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.887
It won't kill him.
Just cool his blood.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.358
Anaa. Anaa.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.947
Taabe wants to stay and hunt.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.032
Let's go.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.326
-I'm coming with you.
-I can handle the lion.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.952
No, it's not just the lion.

16:35.453 --> 16:39.916
Why is Puhi alive? There's something
that scared the cat away from its den.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.584
I've got this.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.253
Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too.

16:45.546 --> 16:49.383
We don't have time to waste talking.
We need to get him home.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.593
ManamÜsohi.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.034
Üts'tü nü.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.703
Tobo'ihupitü.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.165
Kee.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.416
The cold is good.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.127
The medicine slows his blood.
If he gets warm, he'll bleed out.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.630
Hey.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.007
Do you want him
to be comfortable or alive?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.092
Mia.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.494
We don't have time to wait for you.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.955
-Look.
-Could be bear tracks.

18:43.873 --> 18:44.874
Maybe.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.251
But that's a big bear.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.254
And why was it on its hind legs?
And what skins a snake like that?

18:50.338 --> 18:51.922
-We need to keep moving.
-No.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.424
I have to warn my brother.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.344
Paaka, go with her.

19:59.240 --> 20:03.285
Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.955
We're in its hunting grounds.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.581
Why'd you come back?

20:08.416 --> 20:10.751
I found tracks, and they were huge.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.170
I'm not frightened by a bear.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.089
I don't think it was a bear.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.509
I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.220
It skinned and gutted a snake.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.598
Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.600
We have to deal with it first.

20:26.684 --> 20:27.810
Come on.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.736
The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.991
It'll think it's hunting us.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.370
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

20:47.288 --> 20:52.168
A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.379
We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.340
If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.717
We'll try it Naru's way.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.679
We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.098
Wait.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.227
It's time, Naru.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.606
Your kühtaamia.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.527
When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

21:18.611 --> 21:21.155
"This is as far as you go.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.491
No more. This is it."

22:08.786 --> 22:11.705
It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.253
You think you're ready?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.631
You've never faced a lion.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.636
Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

22:27.346 --> 22:31.308
ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.442
When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

22:40.526 --> 22:42.778
-and kill it.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.645
Your brother carried you home.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
Wha-- What about the lion?

24:03.359 --> 24:05.027
-Taabe went after it.
-Okay.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.362
I have to find him.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.822
No, you need to rest.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.325
Ihka.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.661
Drink this tea.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.913
Ihka.

24:25.547 --> 24:29.677
Puhi survived
because of your medicine.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.474
There's something else out there.
Taabe needs my help.

24:37.851 --> 24:42.773
If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

24:46.193 --> 24:50.781
You think the reason for kühtaamia
is to prove you can hunt,

24:50.864 --> 24:53.784
but there's only one reason.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.329
To survive.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.711
Taabe kima! Taabe kima!

27:00.869 --> 27:03.038
-Naru.
-War Chief.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.289
Naru.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.582
Where are you going?

27:06.500 --> 27:07.709
-We did it.

27:08.877 --> 27:09.878
No.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.005
We didn't do it.

27:13.382 --> 27:16.176
What do you think left those tracks
and skinned that snake?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.427
And before I fell,

27:17.511 --> 27:19.304
-I saw lightning in the trees.
-Naru.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.266
-There's something else out there.
-And if there is, I'll get it.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.559
We need to go back out.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.186
-Far, beyond the ridgeline.
-No.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.106
-Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to.
-You can't.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.403
-Do I need your permission, War Chief?
-It's not about permission.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.489
You can't.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.784
I had to carry you back.

27:45.706 --> 27:46.915
I can hunt.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.584
You're right.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.170
We didn't do it.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.131
I did.

27:56.592 --> 27:59.720
You tried it. You just…

28:01.263 --> 28:02.890
You couldn't bring it home.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.133
If they don't see,

29:21.551 --> 29:22.594
then show them.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.930
Kima.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.138
Next time, you're cooking.

34:32.362 --> 34:33.363
Kima.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.242
Nüma'ai kima.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.247
We have to go find
whatever left those tracks.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.624
-Ühkitsi.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.783
Tasiwoo Atsabi, yütsü tsaaku.

36:42.409 --> 36:45.912
Ürako taa ahpü yühmuku.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.274
Sarii?

41:22.939 --> 41:24.524
There you are.

46:18.526 --> 46:21.487
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.406
Your brother sent us to bring you home.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.490
Where is he?

46:24.573 --> 46:26.742
Searching for you
on the other side of the pass.

46:28.786 --> 46:29.996
Where are you going?

46:32.957 --> 46:34.917
-I saw it.
-Saw what?

46:35.376 --> 46:36.836
I saw what left those tracks.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.254
-The bear?
-There was a bear,

46:38.337 --> 46:40.423
but there was something else,
and it was huge.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.217
I couldn't see it until it was
covered in blood, but it looked like--

46:44.677 --> 46:47.138
-like a mupitsI.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.390
You saw a monster from a children's story?

46:49.473 --> 46:52.393
It fought and killed a bear
with its hands, easily.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.312
How come it didn't kill you?

46:57.523 --> 46:58.941
Stop!

46:59.692 --> 47:00.693
You're going home.

47:01.777 --> 47:02.945
-Enough!

47:30.097 --> 47:31.640
Aitü.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.361
You wanna leave? Then leave.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.327
We're going home.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.377
There's something out there.

48:05.341 --> 48:06.342
Quit it!

48:08.969 --> 48:10.179
Just sit.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.683
You need a leash for your weapon?

48:21.148 --> 48:24.151
Get some water.
We'll rest a minute. Stay together.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.862
-What about Taabe?
-He'll meet us back at camp.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.742
I said stay together.

48:32.993 --> 48:35.913
I gotta go take a squat.
You want me to do it here?

48:38.833 --> 48:39.834
Water.

49:34.388 --> 49:35.681
You should see your face.

49:36.265 --> 49:39.101
What do you think
drove the possums our way?

50:25.814 --> 50:27.399
Hey. Cut me loose.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.235
Stay down.

53:05.307 --> 53:07.476
Shh.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.618
-We have him.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.416
No. He has us.

55:20.609 --> 55:23.821
-Regardez ici.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.157
Regardez ici.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.495
Une femme ?

55:31.578 --> 55:33.372
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici ?

55:34.164 --> 55:35.958
Je vais la porter.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.459
Elle va nous ralentir.

55:37.543 --> 55:41.296
Non. Par la façon qu'elle courait,
je crois qu'elle l'a vu.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.819
C'est ton nouveau blonde, hein ?

56:49.531 --> 56:51.617
Dégagez-moi ce putain de chien !

56:53.577 --> 56:55.162
Sarii?

56:55.245 --> 56:57.122
J'ai pas un bon sentiment avec ça.

57:07.549 --> 57:09.343
You killed the buffalo.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.440
Ah…

57:43.794 --> 57:47.756
T'es fâchée ?
Maintenant, tu vas payer.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.508
On va voir qu'est-ce qu'elle sait.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.011
-Parle, sale Raphael.
-Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, hein ?

57:53.095 --> 57:55.639
-C'est un piège ?
-Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?

58:02.854 --> 58:04.523
What did you see?

58:06.066 --> 58:07.859
I speak a lot of languages.

58:10.028 --> 58:12.072
You are Comanche, yes?

58:13.532 --> 58:17.119
-Je vais la tuer.
-Non, non, non, non, non, non, non.

58:17.202 --> 58:19.121
On peut toujours l'utiliser.

58:19.204 --> 58:20.747
Ah.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.920
You should be helping us.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.924
I think this creature is a hunter,

58:32.592 --> 58:34.761
looking for the strongest beast.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.514
What do you know?

58:40.434 --> 58:41.977
It killed your whole party.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.062
Je vais la faire chanter.

58:44.980 --> 58:45.981
No.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.483
It didn't kill everyone.

58:49.693 --> 58:52.029
If you were smart, you'd help us.

58:52.112 --> 58:56.450
Sors le sauvage.
Sortez-lui de la sacrée boîte !

58:59.578 --> 59:00.579
What?

59:01.788 --> 59:06.168
D'une façon ou d'une autre,
tu vas nous aider.

59:07.836 --> 59:10.714
-Fais-le saigner.

59:27.022 --> 59:28.482
Are you hurt?

59:30.150 --> 59:32.736
Oh, they tried.

59:46.833 --> 59:49.086
On n'aurait pas dû amener les chevaux.

59:50.087 --> 59:52.798
Fais-les taire ou la bête ne viendra pas.

59:54.633 --> 59:56.718
Son of a bitch.

59:58.428 --> 1:00:01.848
The thing the white men
are trying to catch…

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:04.184
-…that's what you went out after?

1:00:04.267 --> 1:00:06.436
-It's what you were tracking?

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:07.604
Yes.

1:00:08.271 --> 1:00:10.899
And that's what you chose for kühtaamia?

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:19.491
Elle est où cette pute de bête ?

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:22.410
-J'ai faim et j'ai besoin de pisser.

1:00:27.707 --> 1:00:31.878
-Qu'est-ce qui arrive ?

1:00:31.962 --> 1:00:34.339
Oh, non, non, non.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?

1:00:34.422 --> 1:00:37.384
-Qu'est-ce qui arrive ?
-Qu'est-ce qui arrive ? Rambert !

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:38.969
Tire, Rambert !

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:47.936
Merde.

1:00:58.363 --> 1:01:01.199
I need to get me a horse.

1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:07.581
Il est là !

1:01:09.124 --> 1:01:12.961
-It's coming.
-Il est là !

1:01:16.464 --> 1:01:18.717
Orü posa kwitapÜ.

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:19.968
Naru.

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:24.014
Can you get your side loose?

1:01:53.752 --> 1:01:55.003
Naru.

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:59.132
We're the bait. He's coming for us.

1:02:02.469 --> 1:02:03.470
No.

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:08.683
No. It doesn't want bait.
It doesn't hunt that way.

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:15.357
Before the trappers captured me,
it saw me.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.192
It came right up to me

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:19.319
and then left.

1:02:22.113 --> 1:02:24.241
It didn't think I was a threat.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:32.999
You wanna know how I killed that lion?

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:37.504
Your plan. The tree.

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.130
You weakened it.

1:02:39.798 --> 1:02:41.633
You had it, Naru.

1:02:45.971 --> 1:02:47.681
You can see what I miss.

1:02:48.682 --> 1:02:50.141
You always have.

1:02:51.226 --> 1:02:53.728
I don't know that this thing
can be killed.

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:59.901
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

1:03:09.619 --> 1:03:12.414
-Maintenant !

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:21.715
Naru.

1:03:22.549 --> 1:03:23.550
Naru!

1:03:50.702 --> 1:03:52.162
Salopard !

1:04:58.770 --> 1:05:00.271
What are you doing?

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:03.358
-I have a plan. Get down.

1:05:24.587 --> 1:05:26.881
Do you remember the flood
when we were young?

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:30.468
I saw a beaver that had its legs
pinned between two rocks.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:34.597
The water was rising so fast,
it knew it was going to die.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.768
So it chewed off its own leg.

1:05:38.852 --> 1:05:40.603
Tirez !

1:05:40.687 --> 1:05:42.063
On va frapper les autres !

1:05:42.147 --> 1:05:44.858
Tirez !

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:03.501
It was worth it to the beaver…

1:06:04.085 --> 1:06:05.086
Wait.

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:06.796
…losing its leg to be free.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:08.590
Wait. Naru.

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:11.342
What are you doing, Naru? Naru, stop!

1:06:16.514 --> 1:06:18.099
I'm smarter than a beaver.

1:06:18.725 --> 1:06:20.310
Come on, we gotta go.

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:35.867
-Where are you going?
-I gotta go get us those horses.

1:06:37.202 --> 1:06:38.411
I'll get Sarii.

1:07:21.246 --> 1:07:24.082
Écartez. Écartez-vous !

1:07:57.740 --> 1:07:59.367
Hâtons-nous un peu.

1:07:59.450 --> 1:08:00.493
J'ai besoin d'aide.

1:08:00.577 --> 1:08:04.038
On peut rien faire pour eux.
Simplement on doit continuer d'avancer.

1:08:04.122 --> 1:08:05.331
Et le chien ?

1:08:06.249 --> 1:08:08.001
-J'aime le chien.

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:10.128
Ça goûte mieux que le castor.

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:23.076
Sarii.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.786
Owehkimia, Taabe.

1:09:25.286 --> 1:09:26.704
-Go!

1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:24.011
Help me! Help.

1:10:25.388 --> 1:10:26.556
You have medicine?

1:10:38.568 --> 1:10:41.863
Help me, and I'll show you how to use it.

1:10:42.447 --> 1:10:43.448
Please.

1:10:46.409 --> 1:10:47.410
Please.

1:11:07.054 --> 1:11:10.308
Take the powder
and put it in the gun.

1:11:10.808 --> 1:11:13.561
Not too little, not too much.

1:11:18.649 --> 1:11:19.650
And then what?

1:11:19.734 --> 1:11:23.112
Then you take the ball and the cloth.

1:11:23.196 --> 1:11:25.990
Put it in the gun.

1:11:26.616 --> 1:11:29.744
After that, take the stick you see there.

1:11:31.454 --> 1:11:34.207
You put in the gun, uh, three, four times.

1:11:38.711 --> 1:11:39.921
Last thing.

1:11:41.339 --> 1:11:42.507
It's okay.

1:11:47.136 --> 1:11:49.305
Put powder here.

1:11:49.388 --> 1:11:54.393
Then pull that back and it will fire.

1:11:55.812 --> 1:11:56.813
That's all?

1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.695
Please. It hurts.

1:12:06.781 --> 1:12:08.199
Please.

1:12:13.913 --> 1:12:15.540
What is it?

1:12:31.973 --> 1:12:34.517
What's happening? I'm freezing cold.

1:12:38.896 --> 1:12:40.898
Please.

1:12:40.982 --> 1:12:42.233
Don't leave me.

1:14:03.356 --> 1:14:04.774
It can't see him.

1:15:28.983 --> 1:15:30.776
-Hey!

1:15:43.330 --> 1:15:46.292
"Not too much, not too little."

1:16:02.683 --> 1:16:04.602
Isa'ai!

1:16:18.616 --> 1:16:20.367
We should go.

1:16:22.119 --> 1:16:23.120
Taabe.

1:16:23.788 --> 1:16:25.664
Run, Naru.

1:16:25.748 --> 1:16:27.583
It thinks I'm the threat.

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:30.544
This is as far as I go.

1:16:31.796 --> 1:16:34.548
No more. This is it.

1:16:35.216 --> 1:16:37.426
-No.
-Bring it home.

1:20:40.878 --> 1:20:44.798
Non ! Ah, non ! Non, arrête !

1:20:44.882 --> 1:20:46.050
Putain !

1:21:04.401 --> 1:21:06.070
You bled my brother.

1:21:08.530 --> 1:21:10.115
So now you bleed.

1:21:11.492 --> 1:21:13.619
Idiote sauvage !

1:21:17.706 --> 1:21:20.125
You think that I am not a hunter like you.

1:21:24.838 --> 1:21:28.926
Tu ne sais même pas
l'erreur que tu viens de faire.

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.637
That I am not a threat.

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:35.265
Je vais mettre
une balle dans ton crâne.

1:21:35.349 --> 1:21:37.434
That is what makes me dangerous.

1:21:38.435 --> 1:21:42.439
Tu vas mourir, chienne !

1:21:42.523 --> 1:21:46.318
You can't see that I'm killing you.

1:22:03.877 --> 1:22:05.838
And it won't either.

1:22:34.867 --> 1:22:35.909
Démon !

1:22:37.244 --> 1:22:39.079
Non !

1:26:20.384 --> 1:26:21.426
Petsü!

1:27:16.815 --> 1:27:19.484
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1:27:19.568 --> 1:27:20.569
Do it.

1:27:21.903 --> 1:27:22.946
Come on, do it.

1:27:24.698 --> 1:27:26.533
This is as far as you go.

1:27:27.284 --> 1:27:28.368
No more.

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:31.621
This is it.

1:28:14.414 --> 1:28:15.957
Naru iku kima!

1:28:19.336 --> 1:28:22.756
Arüka ikÜ! Arüka, Naru kima.

1:28:22.839 --> 1:28:24.257
Naru kima.

1:28:24.966 --> 1:28:26.760
Hina ma yaa?

1:28:33.809 --> 1:28:35.185
Hina ma yaa?

1:29:04.756 --> 1:29:07.050
There is danger nearby.

1:29:07.133 --> 1:29:09.135
We need to move
to easier protected ground.
