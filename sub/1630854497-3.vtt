WEBVTT

00:25.160 --> 00:27.720
-We are so good at sex.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.480
But "we" did give birth six weeks ago.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.120
Does that girl ever stop crying?

00:48.680 --> 00:50.520
Where's the bloody wet nurse?

00:50.600 --> 00:52.520
Your sexy talk needs work.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.840
-I'll take her. Thank you.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.680
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
Elizabeth.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.080
You ignore your grumpy father.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.720
Anne knows
that giving Henry a daughter isn't enough.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.880
It's not what she's promised him.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.800
It's not what he needs.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.720
He needs a son. He needs an heir.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.280
England is in turmoil.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.040
It's on the brink
of a religious revolution.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.200
Henry VIII has rejected papal authority,

01:49.280 --> 01:54.360
and he's determined to create
a new, independent Church of England

01:54.440 --> 01:57.480
over which he is the supreme head.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.840
Henry knows that
in order to bring everybody on side,

02:00.920 --> 02:04.560
what he needs more than anything
is that male heir.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.600
Of course,
Henry was disappointed at first.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.800
He was just feeling the pressure
for a son,

02:12.880 --> 02:15.720
because he didn't want
to mess everything up.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.880
His father had big plans
for the Tudor line, and…

02:21.480 --> 02:23.200
and I had promised him a son,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.040
and Boleyns keep their word.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.760
Not getting sick
of all those apples?

02:30.840 --> 02:31.680
Hmm.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.040
Lady W said that she couldn't stop
eating earthworms with her last baby,

02:36.120 --> 02:38.080
so I'm counting my lucky stars!

02:38.160 --> 02:39.520
-Good point.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.760
Still can't believe we managed it
so quickly after Elizabeth.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.440
Well, we have been putting in the effort.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.680
And I don't feel half as sick
as I did last time.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.480
They say boys make you less nauseous.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.800
Well, my astrologer's adamant
that this time it's a boy.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.840
Today we might hope
that our child is born healthy.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.640
Anne hopes for something else.
She hopes it has a penis.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.680
Having a daughter is no good.
Katherine of Aragon had a daughter,

03:08.760 --> 03:09.800
and Henry got rid of her.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.920
Anne has to have a boy
to secure her crown.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.800
And now all we need is a…

03:20.800 --> 03:23.640
Oh my God, he's gorgeous!

03:23.720 --> 03:25.160
Just like his father.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.320
Aww!

03:28.880 --> 03:30.000
Aw!

03:30.080 --> 03:31.240
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

03:31.760 --> 03:34.880
Because every perfect family needs a dog.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.080
Anne's dog
is called Purkoy,

03:37.160 --> 03:40.680
which is said
to derive from the French <i>"pourquoi,"</i>

03:40.760 --> 03:41.840
meaning "why,"

03:41.920 --> 03:44.720
because apparently
it has a quizzical expression,

03:44.800 --> 03:46.600
so that inspired the name.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.280
Purkoy.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.240
Sit, sit, sit!

03:54.880 --> 03:57.160
Oh, I give up. It's me that needs to sit.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.560
I'm so tired.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.520
My feet are killing me.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.600
Purkoy, fetch! Go on!

04:07.680 --> 04:09.600
No, not my coronation shoes.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.200
I felt like
I could rule the world that day.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.000
I'm getting restless, George.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.040
Don't get me wrong,

04:24.120 --> 04:27.680
there's nothing more important
than giving Henry a son,

04:27.760 --> 04:30.520
but there's so much I want to do,

04:30.600 --> 04:33.480
as well as make babies.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.680
You will change the world, Anne.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.680
Just give it time.

04:46.520 --> 04:51.280
Queens were traditionally
expected to simply provide heirs,

04:51.800 --> 04:56.880
but Anne has ambitions and plans
which are rooted in her values.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.520
She wants more for her country.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.480
Anne is personally motivated
to make a difference as Queen.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.240
She wants to help people.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.200
She introduces the notion of charity
into the monarchy.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.680
She wants to help the poor,

05:10.760 --> 05:12.800
she wants better education,

05:12.880 --> 05:15.520
and, of course,
she wants religious reform as well.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.240
Even the most devout Catholics

05:20.320 --> 05:23.760
acknowledge that the corruption
within the monasteries is out of control.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.080
Those greedy bastards
do own all the best land.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.480
That land should belong to the Crown.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.160
Cromwell is a man
who shares reformist ideas,

05:35.240 --> 05:38.920
and he understands
that a great amount of wealth

05:39.000 --> 05:43.960
is stored in the monastic houses,
in the monasteries, of England,

05:44.040 --> 05:48.640
and he sees an opportunity
to transfer that wealth

05:48.720 --> 05:51.040
into the hands of the King.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.280
We could put that money to good use.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.800
Our people need education,
help when they're sick,

05:56.880 --> 05:58.880
and a decent roof over their heads.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.880
-The people's Queen.
-I'm serious.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.600
The amount of money that the monasteries
have hoarded is obscene.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.920
They should be helping the poor,
not making themselves rich.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.880
Things do need to change.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.600
Anne isn't necessarily
like other queens.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.280
She wants to be mother to a son and heir,

06:16.360 --> 06:18.520
but also wants to be
a mother to the kingdom.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.680
She wants to see the wealth of England
taken from the monasteries

06:21.760 --> 06:23.680
and dispersed to the people who need it.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.440
We'd meet resistance from the Church.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.880
Yes, but who's in charge now?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.160
-You.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.680
We do need to think this through though.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.640
-Come up with a--
-Agh!

06:39.160 --> 06:41.160
-Anne?
-Oh!

06:41.680 --> 06:42.800
My God, Anne.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.840
Anne.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
The baby!

06:57.360 --> 06:58.520
It's impossible…

07:01.840 --> 07:04.720
to explain how it feels
when you lose your baby.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.320
Growing that little person inside you.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.960
It's a part of you.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.840
And when that little person dies…

07:24.360 --> 07:25.720
a part of you dies too.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.240
Henry was so sure it was a boy.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.960
He found it hard to even look at me.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.280
It was heartbreaking.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.280
And it didn't help
that the rumor mill got going.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.080
Because if there's one thing
the court loves,

07:55.680 --> 07:58.480
it's gossiping about
other people's misfortunes.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.960
I didn't miscarry
because the baby was deformed.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.480
Where do people get this stuff?

08:06.560 --> 08:10.080
This will make you laugh.
It's because you're a witch.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.360
That's a new one.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.720
How is Henry?

08:15.240 --> 08:18.840
A bit distant actually.
He's finding it hard, I think.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.000
It is hard. For both of you.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.880
I've just wanted to hide.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.480
Queens can't do that.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.960
You have to slap on a smile
and get back out there.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.880
If she doesn't smile,

08:33.960 --> 08:36.880
then people whip up gossip

08:36.960 --> 08:39.920
about how Henry is surely
getting tired of her

08:40.000 --> 08:42.640
and is going to go off to somebody else.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.960
It's hugely stressful for a woman
who is already under considerable stress

08:48.040 --> 08:50.240
to have to constantly perform.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.000
["Unleash The Beast"
by Richard Macklin plays"

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
Anne.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.480
Good to see
you're feeling more… social again.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.840
The Duke of Norfolk.
My uncle, unfortunately.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.320
Locked his wife in a cupboard
and sold all her jewelry.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.680
Mary.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.400
Anne.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.240
Anne.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.400
Anne.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.160
Can you just wait?

10:22.240 --> 10:25.520
How could you turn up like this?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.360
I am so sorry.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.800
No, I am the Queen of England,

10:28.880 --> 10:33.200
and you have married some lowlife soldier
and got yourself pregnant.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.880
I'm so sorry you lost your baby, Anne.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.880
Do you have any idea
what people are going to say about me now?

10:39.960 --> 10:43.160
-Can't you just be happy for me?
-You can't stand seeing me with Henry.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.760
I don't care, Anne. I've never loved him.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.000
He never really wanted me.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.440
It's won't be long
until he doesn't want you either.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.480
Get out.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.840
Get out, and don't come back.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.200
Tell me you want me.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.800
What's wrong?

11:42.120 --> 11:43.080
Henry.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.440
Bloody Peeking Purkoy.
He's always watching me.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.120
He's watching my every move,
that bloody dog.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.880
-What are you talking about?
-I wanted a son!

11:54.480 --> 11:55.520
A son!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.120
Not a dog.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.200
I wanted a son.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.400
Henry.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.360
At the very core
of Anne and Henry's relationship

12:18.440 --> 12:20.000
has been this promise.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.040
This promise
that Anne is going to give him

12:22.120 --> 12:24.200
the son and heir that he's been craving.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.680
She's disappointed him.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.000
The weight of this promise
has been heavily on her shoulders,

12:29.080 --> 12:31.360
not just with Henry,
but with the whole realm.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.560
The court has always
waited for Anne to trip up,

12:34.640 --> 12:37.160
and now she's just giving them ammunition.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.720
Does your wife find your jokes as funny,
Weston?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.840
There is only one woman
I really want to make smile.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.360
Weston.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.400
Francis Weston
is one of Henry's inner circle,

12:59.480 --> 13:02.200
and he's knighted at Anne's coronation.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.360
Weston is someone Anne knows well.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.080
It's clear
to everyone at court

13:16.160 --> 13:19.880
that there's no love lost
between these two sisters-in-law.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.160
Jane does not like Anne.
She doesn't like Anne's growing ego.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.720
She doesn't like Anne's power.

13:28.880 --> 13:29.720
Anne.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.360
Purkoy has been found dead.

13:33.080 --> 13:33.960
What?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.440
He fell from a window. I'm so sorry.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.480
F… Wh…

13:42.720 --> 13:45.560
Out. Everybody out!

13:51.320 --> 13:54.200
-He fell from a window?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.880
Henry, there's no way
that this could be an accident.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.480
S… Som… Somebody did this deliberately.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.560
It's Henry who tells her
that the dog has died.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.800
There's this little creature
that is close to her,

14:07.880 --> 14:10.680
that brings her joy,
and suddenly it's been taken away.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.320
Is that really an accident?
How did it happen?

14:18.000 --> 14:18.880
I'm so sorry.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.080
I think Anne is starting
to feel incredibly vulnerable…

14:40.320 --> 14:42.160
…and isolated
at the moment.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.600
It feels like
everything that she has worked for

14:45.680 --> 14:48.600
is starting to slip through her fingers.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.640
There are people at court

14:50.720 --> 14:53.800
who are looking for a moment
when Anne is weak.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.480
If Anne doesn't deliver the son
that will secure her position,

14:58.080 --> 15:00.160
then they know that they can step in

15:00.680 --> 15:04.320
and that they can turn Henry against her.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.320
My super sweet lady-in-waiting
Jane Seymour.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.840
<i>Très</i> polite. <i>Très</i> chaste.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.560
England is in crisis.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.560
There are traitors in our midst,
and they grow in number every day.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.920
Henry's religious reforms
have split the country in two,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.240
and there's huge opposition to the fact

15:55.320 --> 15:59.560
that now the King, not the pope,
is head of the Church.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.160
They're contagious.
A plague among our people.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.160
And just like the plague,

16:06.240 --> 16:07.960
death is inevitable.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.040
Always the entertainer.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.360
Thank you.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.040
As you were.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.320
The Treason Act of 1534
marks a turning point in Henry's reign.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.080
He beats his subjects into submission,

16:25.160 --> 16:29.360
makes it punishable by death
if they speak out against him.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.720
-What's wrong with you?

16:38.800 --> 16:42.920
This is a party, and you're talking about
death and plague. What's wrong with <i>you?</i>

16:43.000 --> 16:44.520
You're right. This is a party,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.880
so at least one of us
should be entertaining our guests.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.200
I thought you'd done
a marvelous job of that already.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.640
Is my lady-in-waiting a good listener?

16:52.480 --> 16:53.800
Henry. Henry, hey.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.800
Let's get out of here.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.760
Let's go somewhere, just the two of us.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.440
You're ridiculous, Anne.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.920
You sense
that men like Thomas Cromwell

17:18.000 --> 17:22.720
are starting to understand that Anne
is becoming a very costly investment,

17:22.800 --> 17:25.440
and so far
she has yielded very little return.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.680
There was a reason Henry fell for me,

17:32.480 --> 17:35.640
a reason he… changed everything,

17:36.240 --> 17:38.720
risked everything, for me.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.280
That day, I remembered the hunger.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.560
I was still the girl
who'd gone out hunting

17:46.640 --> 17:48.120
and brought back a king.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.120
An uprising
of nobles in Ireland,

17:53.880 --> 17:56.160
a very real threat of invasion from Spain

17:57.120 --> 17:58.240
and France,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.000
and Catholic Europe no longer sees you
as one of theirs.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.280
Right, so on top of countless rebellions,

18:05.360 --> 18:08.640
crop failure, famine,
an outbreak of the plague,

18:08.720 --> 18:10.400
we're now looking at war with Europe.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.480
What's on the menu?

18:17.800 --> 18:18.840
Nothing but trouble.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.200
We'll finish this later.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.480
Cromwell
wants to be Henry's right-hand man.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.280
He wants to be the chief advisor.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.440
Anne wants to be Henry's right-hand woman.
<i>She </i>wants to be the chief advisor.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.560
You cannot have two in the one court.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.800
It's just not big enough
for the both of them.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.760
Let's go hunting.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.200
Like we used to.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.960
I've got a lot going on right now, Anne.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.160
And I was thinking

18:47.240 --> 18:50.960
about what else we used to do.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.360
Anne.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.040
Now, the monasteries' money

19:07.760 --> 19:11.760
will solve our little crop
and famine crisis.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.760
And as for Europe…

19:18.360 --> 19:20.880
we can pull together
a little peace treaty.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.640
Surely.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.400
1536 is a crisis year
for Henry,

19:44.480 --> 19:46.400
and there are uprisings against him.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.880
There are harvest failures,
economic hardship.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.840
He has never known
a more turbulent time in his reign.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.960
And now Henry's first wife,
Katherine of Aragon, has died.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.600
Her memory is revered across the court
and indeed the kingdom.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.720
Anne appearing
at this event in yellow

20:08.800 --> 20:11.480
would have more than set tongues wagging.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.440
This is typical Anne,

20:13.520 --> 20:14.760
bold as brass

20:14.840 --> 20:18.440
and not really caring much
about what anyone thinks.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.000
I am <i>so </i>sorry for your loss.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.800
Some argue that yellow
denotes the color of mourning in Spain,

20:26.880 --> 20:30.800
that this is
a mark of respect for Katherine.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.400
This is more about a celebration moment.

20:34.480 --> 20:38.280
We come together to mark the passing
of the Dowager Princess of Wales,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.560
Katherine of Aragon.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.440
Arrangements are being made
for her funeral at Peterborough Cathedral,

20:44.080 --> 20:46.760
but let us say a prayer for her now.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.080
Any chance of a seat?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.400
I'm with child.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.440
Her great rival is dead,
and Anne is pregnant.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.400
This is the perfect scenario,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.800
because it means
that the child that is born

21:10.880 --> 21:14.800
will be undisputed as the legitimate heir,

21:14.880 --> 21:18.200
because Katherine is
no longer in the way to meddle.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.040
We can forgive Anne

21:20.120 --> 21:25.480
for feeling rather triumphant
and rejoicing in this moment.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.560
Help! Somebody help!

21:53.040 --> 21:57.840
Maybe you didn't blow it out properly.
Had plenty of baby-brain moments myself.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.360
I know how to blow out a candle.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.040
It was started on purpose.
Somebody wants me dead.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.080
Why do you think that?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.040
First the hate mail,

22:08.120 --> 22:10.680
then somebody throws my dog from a window,

22:10.760 --> 22:11.680
and now this.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.600
They say these things come in threes,
so there you go. You've had yours.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.280
There's been an accident.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.560
It's 24th January 1536,

22:26.640 --> 22:30.280
and Henry has fallen from his horse
whilst jousting.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.600
Henry!

22:35.880 --> 22:36.840
Oh!

22:36.920 --> 22:38.720
Henry, please don't die.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.080
I knew this was going to happen.
I told him to be careful.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.320
Head injuries can be fatal.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.320
Tell me he's gonna be okay, Uncle.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.560
Anne is frightened.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.960
Her position depends entirely on Henry.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.200
If Henry dies,
then everything dissolves for her.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.960
Doesn't matter that
she was crowned Queen of England.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.440
In the end, it's said
it's a miracle that he lives,

23:04.520 --> 23:08.480
and that he is unconscious,
as a result, for two hours.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.200
It is thought possible that, actually,
when he fell off his horse that day,

23:14.280 --> 23:16.360
he bruises his cerebral cortex,

23:16.440 --> 23:18.480
he damages his brain.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.240
Henry, how are you feeling?

23:33.840 --> 23:36.760
Only a week ago, you were near dead.

23:37.840 --> 23:41.160
I am carrying your child, and your--

23:41.240 --> 23:44.640
You should be concentrating on our baby,
our son.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.600
-Not worrying about what I'm doing.
-Are you kidding me?!

23:48.680 --> 23:50.680
Where the hell do you think you're going?

23:51.880 --> 23:55.920
Have you forgotten you're actually
my lady-in-waiting and not his…

24:02.760 --> 24:05.080
You cheating bastard!

24:24.560 --> 24:28.160
It turns out
to be a miscarriage.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.360
She loses her child.

24:31.440 --> 24:36.280
And they can look at the fetus and see

24:36.360 --> 24:38.160
that it would have been a boy.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.800
My heart was broken.

24:48.120 --> 24:53.680
And I wasn't just mourning my son.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.960
I was mourning everything.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.920
Everything I thought we were going to be.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.800
I knew things weren't exactly working out.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.680
But I didn't expect him to buckle.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.800
While Anne lay there,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.480
recovering from the trauma,

25:16.560 --> 25:19.960
Henry visited her, very briefly,

25:20.920 --> 25:24.280
and said, "I see that
God will not give me male children."

25:24.360 --> 25:29.880
That would have been a moment
of real divide between the two of them

25:29.960 --> 25:33.520
as their grief took them
in totally different ways.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.160
"How many women are there,
who, because of their husbands' harshness,

25:38.240 --> 25:41.000
spend their weary lives
in the bond of marriage

25:41.080 --> 25:42.760
in greater suffering

25:42.840 --> 25:45.520
than if they were slaves
among the Saracens?"

25:46.400 --> 25:49.040
Why must women's fortunes
be tied to men's?

25:49.120 --> 25:52.400
-I hate how little choice we have.
-Totally.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.840
Oh my God. What is it?

26:01.160 --> 26:02.480
He's done it again.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.400
More debts.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.640
Well, there you go. Proof and point.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.800
I mean it this time, Anne.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.360
I think we're ruined.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.120
I'm pregnant.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.240
Again.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.040
Of course you are.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.360
Poor Lady W with her feckless husband
and her seven kids.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.040
I suppose you'll be wanting
some more money now.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.480
No. No, I couldn't.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.240
No, let's not do that dance.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.240
Go on.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.800
Take it.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.440
I do need this.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.600
But I needed <i>you </i>more.

27:11.400 --> 27:15.360
It's in Anne's character
that when she's feeling under pressure,

27:15.440 --> 27:16.880
she lashes out.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.360
You would think
that she would draw her friends closer,

27:20.440 --> 27:22.760
but instead she alienates them.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.400
There's a sense now
for Anne

27:26.480 --> 27:29.000
that the court is like a pressure cooker.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.240
It's deeply divided.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.440
Some people are supporting Anne.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.080
Others are looking to her rival,
Jane Seymour.

27:40.080 --> 27:44.000
Well, it seems Plain Jane Seymour
seems to turn him on these days.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.400
Too bad she won't sleep with him.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.400
That little bitch
is trying to steal my crown.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.280
You're overreacting.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.200
I lost the baby because of her!

27:55.720 --> 27:56.680
Anne.

27:57.680 --> 28:01.360
The King is distracted,
but you can't afford to be.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.680
What do you mean?

28:05.240 --> 28:06.080
Cromwell.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.520
Money's coming in thick and fast
from dissolving the monasteries.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.840
-Good. That was the plan.
-Yes.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.920
But apparently he's using it
to line his own pockets.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.160
Sly, sly snake.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.200
Anne.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.160
When Henry makes himself
head of the new Church,

28:26.240 --> 28:29.320
he seizes all of the Church's wealth,

28:29.400 --> 28:32.480
and there's nothing richer
than the monasteries,

28:32.560 --> 28:35.680
these great symbols
of the old Catholic faith.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.960
The architect
of this sweeping religious change

28:39.040 --> 28:42.080
is Thomas Cromwell,
Henry's right-hand man.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.520
What are you playing at?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.280
Following the King's orders.

28:48.360 --> 28:53.480
Those funds were supposed to do good,
not pay for your pleasures.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.960
I thought we were friends.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.400
Queens don't have friends.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.760
They have allies or enemies,
and I have always been your ally.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.760
Oh, I'd hate for that to change.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.760
One word from me,
and Henry will have your head for this.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.800
Oh, the King knows.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.440
Did he not tell you?

29:23.120 --> 29:25.000
You won't get away with this.

29:27.000 --> 29:27.960
I won't let you.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.320
<i>Cromwell.</i>

29:33.440 --> 29:36.080
A wheeling, dealing lowlife.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.960
My judge of character was way out.
I should've seen that coming.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.400
He was always there,

29:45.480 --> 29:48.480
right by Henry's side,
wedging himself between us,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.520
poisoning my own husband against me.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.920
I had to make Henry see sense.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.800
Elizabeth, darling. Say hello to Daddy.

30:00.480 --> 30:04.200
Darling. I didn't know
you were coming to see me. Come.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.760
Give me a kiss.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.280
You can't let Cromwell do this.
He's creaming off thousands.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.400
You have no right
to deal with state affairs.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.840
I should never have allowed it. Come.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.080
"Allowed it"?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.960
You'd be lost without me.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.680
You've caused chaos,

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
divided a nation.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.040
I'm the weakest I've ever been,
because of you.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.160
England needed change.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.400
What do you know about what England needs?

30:33.480 --> 30:35.800
Your head's full of heretical nonsense.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.840
You are England. <i>We </i>are England.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.320
You don't need a son, Henry.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.800
You have our daughter, Elizabeth.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.160
You have your heir.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.400
She is the best of both of us.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.960
Don't be absurd.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.520
Only a man can rule England.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.760
And I need a son.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.200
Take the child away.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.520
Be a good girl.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.160
Mummy loves you.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.440
Maybe if you were in my bed,

31:15.520 --> 31:18.320
instead of fawning over Plain Jane,
you might still get a son.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.640
Jane is easier to be around than you are.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.680
You are so…

31:23.360 --> 31:25.480
I don't recognize you anymore.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.440
-Jane knows who she is.
-Oh, and I don't?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.960
God is punishing me, Anne. For you!

31:31.040 --> 31:33.080
For us. For what we've done.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.520
We have brought the people closer to God
than they have ever been!

31:36.600 --> 31:37.760
Enough!

31:40.560 --> 31:43.960
You have no right to promise me
something that you could never give.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.120
Anne was
Henry's great obsession for years,

31:49.200 --> 31:53.160
but she hasn't given him the son
that he so desperately craved,

31:53.240 --> 31:57.400
and now he believes
the marriage is cursed.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.400
Henry knows he's losing
the love of his people.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.120
They're rebelling against
his religious reforms,

32:05.200 --> 32:09.320
and in his eyes, there's only
one person responsible.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.240
His own wife, Anne.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.520
And it's around this time
that Anne has an unusual conversation

32:17.600 --> 32:21.280
with one of the King's closest friends,
Sir Henry Norris.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.520
Are you coming on Saturday?
Jousting and wine.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.720
Nope. I hate jousting.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.120
But you like wine.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.120
Not that much, Norris.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.880
Come on, everyone will be there.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.360
I'll look after you. I promise.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.600
I'm sure you'll have lots of ladies
wanting your attention.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.160
But my heart belongs to you, my Queen.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.800
Why, Norris, I'm a married woman.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.280
Unless, of course, something should happen
to the King.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.760
That kind of talk could cost me my life.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.520
Anne's throwaway remark
is actually life-threatening,

32:59.600 --> 33:01.880
because it's now written into the law

33:01.960 --> 33:05.760
that even speaking of the King's death
is treason.

33:06.960 --> 33:07.800
Your Grace.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.440
Anne is in the dark.

33:12.520 --> 33:17.280
She knows that, ultimately, she is failing
at providing a son and heir,

33:17.360 --> 33:19.000
but she doesn't even know the half of it,

33:19.080 --> 33:21.120
because she doesn't know
who's working against her.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.520
She thinks she has certain individuals
on side, but she doesn't.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.960
She's sitting at a chess board,

33:26.040 --> 33:28.680
and she has no idea
who's sitting opposite her.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.200
-What are you doing here?
-I just wanted to get away from everyone.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.040
And I thought I'd come and see you
before your next event.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.960
Well, I'm glad you decided to come.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.880
I was hoping to see Henry
at the main event, but…

33:59.680 --> 34:01.160
no sign of him so far.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.560
You'll sort things out.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.120
Look, the man moved heaven and earth
to make you his queen.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.520
Yes. You're right.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.680
Anne.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.600
Mm.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.600
You need to make things right
with Cromwell.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.800
Look, Henry listens to him.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.840
Remember.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.080
You're Anne Boleyn.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.520
You've achieved things
other people only dream of.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.760
I'll wave to you
from the champion's podium.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.000
Boleyns for the win.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.800
All is far from well,
and Anne knows it.

35:24.880 --> 35:28.040
Henry has been avoiding her for days.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.920
She knows that there has been
this urgent meeting

35:31.000 --> 35:33.120
of the Privy Council at Greenwich,

35:33.200 --> 35:35.720
but she doesn't know what's going on.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.880
The King is charging you with adultery.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.640
Anne is arrested
by the Privy Council.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.360
When she arrives
at the Tower of London,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.200
she is told
that she will not be in the dungeons,

36:11.280 --> 36:13.200
but in the Queen's apartments.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.960
The same apartments where she spent
the night before her coronation.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.080
She remembers that night
before her initial triumph.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.600
She was about to be Queen of England.
Now she's a prisoner.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.280
Adultery.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.880
It's absurd.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.160
I love Henry.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.240
He knows that.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.760
Everyone knows that.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.160
Where have these accusations come from?

36:41.040 --> 36:42.440
I don't have any answers.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.480
My job is simply to look after you
while you're here in the tower.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.040
William Kingston
is the constable of the tower,

36:52.120 --> 36:54.160
in effect, Anne's jailer,

36:54.240 --> 36:58.320
but in Anne's eyes,
he's also a trusted confidant,

36:58.400 --> 36:59.760
almost a friend.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.040
She's very isolated at this point,

37:02.120 --> 37:04.600
and she pours her heart out to him.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.440
You'd better get some rest.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.440
Good night, Your Majesty.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.320
Good night, Kingston.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.240
<i>Silence!</i>

37:17.480 --> 37:18.480
Anne Boleyn.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.840
You are charged
with adultery, incest, and treason.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.240
Despising your marriage to the King,

37:28.320 --> 37:32.760
you did follow your frail and carnal lust
on 20 separate occasions

37:33.400 --> 37:36.040
and traitorously engaged
in sexual relations

37:36.120 --> 37:38.240
with the King's servants,

37:39.520 --> 37:40.560
Henry Norris…

37:42.800 --> 37:44.240
Francis Weston,

37:45.640 --> 37:46.800
Mark Smeaton.

37:49.320 --> 37:54.240
You also procured and incited
your own brother, George Boleyn,

37:54.320 --> 37:55.680
to violate you.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.600
This… This is insane.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.520
And you did conspire the King's death
with your adulterers

38:02.600 --> 38:04.920
as evidenced by the conversation
with Henry Norris

38:05.000 --> 38:07.400
on 29th April of this year.

38:07.480 --> 38:11.080
Unless, of course, something should happen
to the King.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.880
Anne Boleyn,

38:12.960 --> 38:15.880
how do you plead to these charges?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.400
Not guilty.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.680
And every one of you here knows it.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.960
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

38:36.360 --> 38:39.240
It's been very… illuminating.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.840
Sir William Kingston
serves Henry above all.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.000
That's where his loyalty lies,

38:47.080 --> 38:49.880
and as the jailer to Queen Anne,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.960
his task is to also spy on her,

38:53.040 --> 38:57.720
to record anything
that might be of use in her trial.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.400
Anne must've been
in a state of bewilderment.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.000
She'd gone from being
the King's great obsession

39:08.080 --> 39:10.480
to accused of treason.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.560
The case against Anne
largely rests on the hearsay,

39:17.640 --> 39:22.120
the gossip, really, of her ladies
who attest to her infidelities.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.760
Once Anne starts losing
that grasp on power,

39:27.840 --> 39:32.640
it becomes so much easier for Jane
and other women like Jane

39:32.720 --> 39:34.480
to make their thoughts felt.

39:34.560 --> 39:38.480
Lady Worcester had been bad-mouthing her
for a while now.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.240
Cromwell clocks all of this.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.760
He is going to use all of this
against Anne.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.320
Watch your back.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.680
The truth doesn't matter here.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.440
All that matters
is removing Anne from power.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.760
Cromwell is the most renowned lawyer
in the kingdom.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.440
He makes sure of his case.

40:03.520 --> 40:07.360
It's a case that wouldn't stand up
in a modern-day court of law.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.640
It's all based on hearsay and rumor,

40:10.720 --> 40:14.680
but Cromwell manages to build it
into something really sinister.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.640
Anne Boleyn,
the jury finds you…

40:20.640 --> 40:22.280
guilty as charged.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.120
-You are sentenced to death…

40:26.200 --> 40:27.560
…by burning or beheading…

40:29.240 --> 40:30.640
…at the King's pleasure.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.600
In her final days,

40:41.680 --> 40:45.160
Anne receives a visit
from her former chaplain

40:45.240 --> 40:48.480
and from the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Thomas Cranmer.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.200
Anne,
this is your chance at freedom.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.800
I knew Henry wouldn't allow this.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.720
If you sign this,
your marriage will be annulled.

41:01.920 --> 41:02.760
Annulled?

41:02.840 --> 41:04.080
Mm.

41:04.160 --> 41:07.200
He's been one
of her biggest allies at court,

41:07.280 --> 41:12.920
but he's been sent now to persuade Anne
to agree to an annulment.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.160
On what basis?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.840
Don't worry about the details.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.640
Does Henry know about this?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.400
What would it mean for Elizabeth?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.880
She would be declared a bastard

41:32.960 --> 41:35.160
and be removed
from the line of succession.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.040
Anne.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.480
If you sign this, you could avoid death

41:40.560 --> 41:42.720
and live out the rest of your days
in a convent.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.360
It's a lifeline, Anne.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.960
Please take it.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.560
This is all Cromwell!

41:52.000 --> 41:54.120
I just… I need to talk to my husband.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.680
Norris, Brereton, Weston, and Smeaton

41:57.760 --> 42:00.240
were all found guilty of adultery
with you.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.880
They're to be executed tomorrow.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.880
Your brother too.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.160
George?

42:11.480 --> 42:12.320
Now,

42:13.640 --> 42:15.720
if you want to avoid the same fate…

42:49.480 --> 42:51.280
<i>The King has shown you mercy.</i>

42:53.320 --> 42:54.720
Instead of an axe,

42:55.360 --> 42:57.040
you will die by the sword.

42:59.120 --> 43:02.240
Perhaps one of
the cruelest elements of Anne's downfall

43:02.320 --> 43:06.920
was the promise of a reprieve
in return for an annulment.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.920
A promise, of course, which was broken.

43:14.640 --> 43:20.240
It now becomes clear
Henry had already sent for the executioner

43:20.320 --> 43:23.520
before her trial even took place.

43:24.080 --> 43:28.680
He is the one who has decided
that Anne has to go,

43:28.760 --> 43:30.880
and he's masterminded the whole thing.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.040
He wants her executed,

43:33.120 --> 43:36.080
so he can move on and marry Jane Seymour.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.400
I have come here to die.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.320
I pray God save the King

43:43.880 --> 43:46.400
and hope that
he rules over you for years to come.

43:50.120 --> 43:54.160
There never was a gentler
or more forgiving ruler.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.080
To me, he was…

44:04.880 --> 44:07.920
always a good and loving husband.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.000
Please pray for me.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.280
All Anne can think about
is how to protect her daughter

44:20.360 --> 44:23.000
and how to protect her family,
how to protect the Boleyns.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.600
Her father is still alive.
She still has her mother.

44:25.680 --> 44:28.360
She still has her sister
and her sister's children.

44:28.440 --> 44:32.560
She is protecting to the Boleyns
right down to the last moment.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.800
What has just happened
is completely unprecedented.

45:28.880 --> 45:32.240
A Queen of England
has never been put to death before.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.480
Henry threw Anne over,

45:34.560 --> 45:36.680
because she didn't give him a son.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.120
Because, in the end,
she wasn't the woman he wanted her to be.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.080
How glorious, then,

45:43.720 --> 45:48.320
that it is her daughter
who reigned after him.

45:48.400 --> 45:52.960
She would become everything
that Anne had wanted to achieve.

45:53.040 --> 45:57.440
We see it all fulfilled
in that little daughter of hers.

46:00.640 --> 46:05.640
Elizabeth I became
one of the most powerful monarchs

46:05.720 --> 46:07.640
that England has ever had,

46:08.160 --> 46:12.000
and in her eyes, we see Anne Boleyn.
