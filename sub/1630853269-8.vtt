00:16.160 --> 00:17.480
Neve!

00:18.640 --> 00:19.800
Neve!

00:19.840 --> 00:22.680
Stop it!

00:23.320 --> 00:24.000
Victoria. You were still alive
when you were put down here?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.560
Victoria. You were still alive
when you were put down here?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.280
We're the same.
'I know it sounds crazy.'

00:29.320 --> 00:32.000
Neve was here.
Tom's innocent. You know he is.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.520
Neve was here.
Tom's innocent. You know he is.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.280
'William Wyatt's free. Are you
gonna let him get away with it?'

00:35.320 --> 00:37.400
I'm gonna go around there
and kill him myself.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.440
Dad?
I would never hurt Neve.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.000
But you know who it was.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.480
But you know who it was.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.240
Don't you want to know the truth?
What you doing out here on your own?

00:46.720 --> 00:48.000
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me!

00:48.000 --> 00:48.800
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me!

00:48.840 --> 00:50.760
I see where Joe gets his issues.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.840
Hey!

00:52.880 --> 00:54.800
I was never good enough for you,
was I?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.000
I feel sorry for you.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.760
I feel sorry for you.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.400
'Neve. Neve.'

01:01.440 --> 01:03.640
Open your eyes!

01:03.680 --> 01:04.000
You need to go.
What have you told her?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.680
You need to go.
What have you told her?

01:06.720 --> 01:09.320
It was Michael.
Michael killed us.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.920
He can't get away with this.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.000
there's no better days

01:20.000 --> 01:21.320
there's no better days

01:25.200 --> 01:28.000
until I'm scared of day

01:28.000 --> 01:28.560
until I'm scared of day

01:43.720 --> 01:44.000
What have you said?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.480
What have you said?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.680
Nothing.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.880
Oh, my God.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.360
You killed Neve.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.160
Alex, come on. That's crazy.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.000
Don't you touch her!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.320
Don't you touch her!

02:03.440 --> 02:06.120
Let's just stay calm
and talk about this.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.080
Go!

02:15.120 --> 02:16.000
We have to stop her!

02:16.000 --> 02:16.920
We have to stop her!

02:18.560 --> 02:20.800
Is that door the only way out?
Yeah.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.320
Help me.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.200
Victoria!

02:30.240 --> 02:32.000
I already tried.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.080
I already tried.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.600
Oi! We can't just let her go!

02:51.640 --> 02:53.560
If Alex tells Christine,
we're fucked.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.120
I'm gonna tell Christine,

02:55.160 --> 02:56.000
cos this nightmare
has dragged on long enough.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.400
cos this nightmare
has dragged on long enough.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.520
I should've told her
the truth years ago.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.720
You can't.
We're in this together.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.
I'm the idiot who covered for you,

03:04.000 --> 03:04.920
Yeah.
I'm the idiot who covered for you,

03:04.960 --> 03:07.000
who bought this place
to protect you,

03:07.040 --> 03:10.960
who has dug you out of the shit
over and over again.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, I am done!
OK, all right. OK.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.680
Well, I am done!
OK, all right. OK.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.840
Look, forget Alex, forget Christine.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.200
We can leave.
It's over, Michael.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.520
You're on your own.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.000
If the police come for me,
they'll come for you as well.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.800
If the police come for me,
they'll come for you as well.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.320
I'll make sure of it.
I'll tell them it was you.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.720
Well, I've got insurance.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.000
What do you mean?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.200
What do you mean?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.080
Hey! Hey!

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
She's not answering.
Try again.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.760
Tom knew about the belt
because he spoke to Neve.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.000
I swear, he's not involved.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.880
I swear, he's not involved.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.400
Alex can back up his story.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.240
Alex, hi.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.000
Diana?
'I'm here with Maria Kelly.'

04:48.000 --> 04:48.080
Diana?
'I'm here with Maria Kelly.'

04:48.120 --> 04:49.920
Michael killed Neve.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.360
'He was here at the hotel with Dad.'

04:54.760 --> 04:56.000
Dad's been protecting him.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.840
Dad's been protecting him.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.200
Where are they now?
'I don't know.'

04:59.240 --> 05:02.400
They just drove off.
'Together?'

05:02.440 --> 05:04.000
No, separate cars.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.200
No, separate cars.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.320
'Maria, Neve's here somewhere.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.000
I think she's in trouble.'
Stay there! I'm coming!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.160
I think she's in trouble.'
Stay there! I'm coming!

05:13.920 --> 05:15.400
DS Aird to control.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.040
There's a wall.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.280
No, not now.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.680
Please. Please not now.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.000
That's what happened to me.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.360
That's what happened to me.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.640
The angrier I felt, the more
I hated, the more it took hold.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.000
Neve? Neve!

07:04.000 --> 07:04.080
Neve? Neve!

07:04.120 --> 07:06.680
Did you hear that?
Neve!

07:12.200 --> 07:14.440
Alex. Alex.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.000
Come on, we're getting out of here.
Neve!

07:20.000 --> 07:20.480
Come on, we're getting out of here.
Neve!

07:21.440 --> 07:23.640
Neve!
What's wrong?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.000
I can't just leave.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.240
I can't just leave.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.480
They'll find your body.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.000
Everyone will know what happened,
what Michael did.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.400
Everyone will know what happened,
what Michael did.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.280
Everything's changed.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.600
I'm not a part of that world
any more.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.000
Look, I know you're scared.
I was, too.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.880
Look, I know you're scared.
I was, too.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.840
The fear, it...
Well, it never goes away.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.000
But you can fight it.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.680
But you can fight it.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.280
I thought we were the same...
but you're stronger.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.160
We ARE the same.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.000
That darkness, that...anger...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.080
That darkness, that...anger...

08:10.080 --> 08:13.920
..once we're out there,
we can use it to stop Michael.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.400
Where's Neve?
There's a room behind here.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.000
Help me!

08:24.000 --> 08:24.120
Help me!

08:28.840 --> 08:31.080
Come with me.
I can't.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.000
Please, Victoria.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.560
Please, Victoria.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.720
Make him pay for what he did to us.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.000
It was Michael. Michael killed me.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.880
It was Michael. Michael killed me.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.520
He was here with Dad.
The police have gone after him.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.080
Is she OK?
Yes.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.000
I thought she'd gone.
I... I thought she wanted that.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.520
I thought she'd gone.
I... I thought she wanted that.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.800
I think I'm supposed to finish this.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.000
He killed Victoria Sands.
Her body's down there.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.680
He killed Victoria Sands.
Her body's down there.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.520
What's she saying?
What?

09:16.560 --> 09:18.440
Alex, what's happening?

09:18.480 --> 09:20.000
Don't go down there.
Call the police.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.920
Don't go down there.
Call the police.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.880
I'll be back.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.960
Neve, you don't have to do this!

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
The police are onto him now.
He'll be arrested.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.120
The police are onto him now.
He'll be arrested.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.120
What if there's not enough evidence?

09:54.160 --> 09:56.280
What if they let him walk
and he does it again?

09:56.320 --> 10:00.000
The only way of making sure that he
gets justice is if I do this myself.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.200
The only way of making sure that he
gets justice is if I do this myself.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.120
Do what?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.240
Are you gonna stop me?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.840
Do you want me to?

10:31.960 --> 10:32.000
I love you.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.440
I love you.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.880
Is it her?

10:50.920 --> 10:53.600
We can't be sure
until forensics confirm

10:53.640 --> 10:56.000
but the clothing matches Victoria's
description the day she disappeared.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.720
but the clothing matches Victoria's
description the day she disappeared.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.200
Um, excuse me.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.720
I can't get my head around it.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.800
Uncle Michael.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.440
I'm so sorry.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.000
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.400
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.000
None of this is your fault.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.960
Ah, shit!

12:22.320 --> 12:24.000
When will we know for sure
if it's her?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
When will we know for sure
if it's her?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.840
It's her.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.840
OK. It's OK.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.640
So, she was murdered?

12:34.680 --> 12:36.880
Well, the police will give us
the details.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.000
We used to play in that hall,

12:39.040 --> 12:40.000
and all the time,
she was boarded up in the basement.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.360
and all the time,
she was boarded up in the basement.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.040
Like she was nothing.
Like she didn't matter.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.840
Just shut away in the dark, alone.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.000
She shouldn't be on her own.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.200
She shouldn't be on her own.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.960
Max is right.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.680
Wait. Where are you going?
The Hall.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.000
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'm not asking!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.640
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'm not asking!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.840
Don't try and stop me!
I'm not. I think you should all go.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.000
You need to say goodbye...
however you can.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.280
You need to say goodbye...
however you can.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.000
Kids at school used to give me shit.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.640
Kids at school used to give me shit.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.040
They'd say,
"Even your mum ran away from you."

13:26.960 --> 13:28.000
Part of me believed them
for a while.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.200
Part of me believed them
for a while.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.320
She loved you guys...so much.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.000
And she'd be so proud.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.080
And she'd be so proud.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.440
Come here.

13:59.960 --> 14:00.000
Where are you? I thought you'd -
Just tell me the truth.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.240
Where are you? I thought you'd -
Just tell me the truth.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.040
Michael killed Victoria Sands
and Neve Kelly.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.600
And you knew about it?

14:18.000 --> 14:23.080
I helped him move Victoria
to the cellar at Keaton Hall and...

14:24.680 --> 14:26.560
..helped him seal it up.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.560
'He told me about Neve
the night it happened.'

14:33.880 --> 14:36.520
I wanted to tell you so many times.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.680
'You're at the house?'

14:39.720 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.440
Yeah.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.280
'Stay there. I'm sending officers.'

14:45.040 --> 14:46.520
OK.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.160
Michael's here.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.000
I love you.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.240
I love you.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.000
I just want to talk.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.880
I just want to talk.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.000
Then what's that for?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.040
Then what's that for?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.680
Sit down.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.000
Neve's still here.
She knows who killed her.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.800
Neve's still here.
She knows who killed her.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.360
So, what is it...

15:50.600 --> 15:52.000
..this protection?

15:52.000 --> 15:52.920
..this protection?

15:52.960 --> 15:54.760
Evidence of what you did.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.560
Ah, you're lying.

16:00.400 --> 16:06.160
Look, I know that I fucked up,
but that's why I need you.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.840
I can't handle this on my own.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.520
Come on!

16:16.480 --> 16:19.040
You've helped me before.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.840
I thought you made a mistake.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.000
One snap decision, one time.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.880
One snap decision, one time.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.560
I told myself
that you weren't responsible...

16:29.120 --> 16:32.000
..that it was the...grief, alcohol.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.360
..that it was the...grief, alcohol.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.520
Yeah.
And then you did it again.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.560
To Neve.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.000
I had to lead a search party,
knowing what you'd done.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I had to lead a search party,
knowing what you'd done.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.000
I had to stand at the vigil
and look her family in the eyes.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.960
I had to stand at the vigil
and look her family in the eyes.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.800
And every time I see them...

17:01.280 --> 17:03.840
..it eats away at me like a cancer.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.280
Is that what it's like for you?

17:12.040 --> 17:15.160
Look, we can make this go away,
just like Victoria.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.040
We can fix it together.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.240
Just tell me about this evidence.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.000
You tell me what it is...
or I go after Alex.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.160
You tell me what it is...
or I go after Alex.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.640
And Christine.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.000
You tell me!
All right!

17:36.000 --> 17:36.200
You tell me!
All right!

17:37.800 --> 17:40.240
It's the buckle from the belt
you used on Neve!

17:41.080 --> 17:44.000
I burnt that belt. It was ashes.
Was it?

17:44.000 --> 17:44.040
I burnt that belt. It was ashes.
Was it?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.760
All right, well, where is it?

17:47.760 --> 17:49.720
It's at the motocross club.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.680
Not there.
Where else would she go?

17:58.720 --> 18:00.000
I don't know. The police station?
The motocross club?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.720
I don't know. The police station?
The motocross club?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.640
Where is it?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.000
OK.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.560
OK.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.480
Yes!

19:39.200 --> 19:41.320
What...?

20:02.160 --> 20:04.160
I know what you are now.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.280
I know what you did to me.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.160
I need you to see me.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.000
I want you to look me in the eyes.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.440
I want you to look me in the eyes.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
I'm not just your victim.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.000
I had a name...and a face...
and a life.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.080
I had a name...and a face...
and a life.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.720
You're gonna pay for what you did.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.000
I will haunt your every moment.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.920
I will haunt your every moment.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.160
I will fill your days with fear

20:38.200 --> 20:40.000
and I won't stop until it kills you.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.200
and I won't stop until it kills you.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.400
Fuck's sake.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.840
Look at me!

21:34.960 --> 21:36.000
Tom!

21:36.000 --> 21:36.600
Tom!

21:49.320 --> 21:50.840
Oh, my God.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.000
I called the police.
Help me get him out!

21:52.000 --> 21:53.800
I called the police.
Help me get him out!

21:53.840 --> 21:55.520
He killed her!

21:55.560 --> 21:57.680
Tom, if he dies,
you'll go to prison.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.000
Well, Neve deserves justice.
Not like this. Not from you.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.760
Well, Neve deserves justice.
Not like this. Not from you.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.280
Dad!

22:57.840 --> 22:59.640
Neve.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.920
I'm sorry, boss.
You can't go in there.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.000
I need to see my husband.
Is he all right?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.960
I need to see my husband.
Is he all right?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.000
No...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.440
No...

23:53.120 --> 23:55.280
The buckle isn't here.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.600
Wh... Where else could it be?

24:09.160 --> 24:11.160
Get the police.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.000
Michael saw you?

26:24.000 --> 26:24.520
Michael saw you?

26:25.240 --> 26:27.120
Do you remember we came home

26:27.160 --> 26:29.400
and found you passed out
in the bathroom?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.000
Why would you bring that up?
Mum had to revive you.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.200
Why would you bring that up?
Mum had to revive you.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.240
Yeah.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.000
Dad...you died.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.360
Dad...you died.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.440
Alex had her accident. Michael...

26:46.280 --> 26:48.000
Did anything like that
ever happen to William?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.200
Did anything like that
ever happen to William?

26:50.360 --> 26:53.840
He came off his bike.
He was in a coma.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.000
It's like...wherever I am right now,
you've...you've all been here, too.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.920
It's like...wherever I am right now,
you've...you've all been here, too.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.000
Just for a moment.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.880
Just for a moment.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
That's how you can see me.

27:11.680 --> 27:12.000
So, what now?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.680
So, what now?

27:28.400 --> 27:32.520
You've been charged with
your brother's murder,
so you're already facing life.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.840
Might as well get it
all off your chest, Michael.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.000
Tell us about Neve Kelly
and Victoria Sands.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.760
Tell us about Neve Kelly
and Victoria Sands.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.680
You had an alibi
for the night of Neve's murder,

27:42.720 --> 27:44.000
but phone mast data says
that you returned to Abbington

27:44.000 --> 27:45.400
but phone mast data says
that you returned to Abbington

27:45.440 --> 27:48.080
at least ten hours before
you say you did.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.840
So, explain to me what happened
when you got back that night.

27:51.880 --> 27:52.000
When did you first see Neve?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.880
When did you first see Neve?

27:55.680 --> 27:59.480
I didn't touch Neve Kelly...
or Victoria.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.240
My brother killed the pair of them.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.320
That's why we fought
and that's why I killed him.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.000
It was self-defence.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.400
It was self-defence.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.400
He was gonna do it again.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.480
I had to stop him.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.600
I was helping you.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.840
I think you're lying, Michael.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.520
You've been carrying this burden
for a long time.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.000
Must be all you ever think about.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.680
Must be all you ever think about.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.680
William's the bad guy here.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.600
Not me.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.000
I don't believe you.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.120
I don't believe you.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.760
Well, where's your evidence?

28:43.280 --> 28:46.760
Before he died,
William told Christine what you did

28:46.800 --> 28:48.000
and he left evidence.

28:48.000 --> 28:48.720
and he left evidence.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.000
So...tell me about Neve Kelly.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.720
So...tell me about Neve Kelly.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.280
Michael David Wyatt,

29:15.120 --> 29:18.280
you are charged
with the offences shown below.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.000
That you did murder Victoria Sands,
contrary to Common Law,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.560
That you did murder Victoria Sands,
contrary to Common Law,

29:23.600 --> 29:28.000
and that you did murder Neve Kelly,
contrary to Common Law.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.840
and that you did murder Neve Kelly,
contrary to Common Law.

29:28.880 --> 29:32.760
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

29:32.800 --> 29:34.560
if you do not mention now

29:34.600 --> 29:36.000
something you later rely on
in court.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.800
something you later rely on
in court.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.800
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.000
Do you understand?

29:44.000 --> 29:44.120
Do you understand?

29:46.120 --> 29:47.640
Yeah.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.840
Put me in another cell!

29:59.880 --> 30:00.000
Hey! Don't leave me in here!

30:00.000 --> 30:02.120
Hey! Don't leave me in here!

30:07.360 --> 30:08.000
You're not real.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.400
You're not real.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.400
You can't be.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.600
See, it's the trauma.
I'm going mad.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.000
You don't get to talk about trauma.
Not to me.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.480
You don't get to talk about trauma.
Not to me.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.920
You're still alive.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.560
I don't care
what you've been through.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.000
If you were bullied at school.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.200
If you were bullied at school.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.360
If William picked on you
your whole life.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.760
That your wife died of cancer.
That your son preferred his uncle.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.000
I don't give a shit
about any of that.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.120
I don't give a shit
about any of that.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.560
Your life means nothing to me.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.960
I just want to know why.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.000
Why me?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.040
Why me?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.440
You did this to yourself...

31:03.040 --> 31:04.000
..cos you spoke to me
like I was nothing.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.960
..cos you spoke to me
like I was nothing.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.720
Was mouthing off -
about Joseph, about our lives!

31:09.760 --> 31:12.000
You had no right to judge me.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.240
You had no right to judge me.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.800
So you "taught me a...a lesson"?

31:15.840 --> 31:20.000
I have worked hard my whole life
to put a roof over our heads,

31:20.000 --> 31:20.320
I have worked hard my whole life
to put a roof over our heads,

31:20.360 --> 31:22.480
to raise Joseph, to give him a life!

31:22.520 --> 31:24.120
Why can't you respect that?!

31:24.160 --> 31:28.000
Why can't you praise me?
Just once, why can't I have that?!

31:28.000 --> 31:28.840
Why can't you praise me?
Just once, why can't I have that?!

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
And what was Victoria's "lesson"?

31:46.400 --> 31:49.000
I loved her.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.000
But she made me feel stupid, like
I could never have someone like her.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.080
But she made me feel stupid, like
I could never have someone like her.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.720
She should've loved me back.
You don't know how to love.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.160
We had our whole lives ahead of us.

32:04.200 --> 32:08.000
I saw a future that I'll never have
because you took it away.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.880
I saw a future that I'll never have
because you took it away.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.800
And for what?

32:16.960 --> 32:19.240
What's the fucking point of it?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.000
Men like you have been doing this
for centuries...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.040
Men like you have been doing this
for centuries...

32:26.200 --> 32:29.000
..justifying it to yourselves,
to your mates...

32:29.960 --> 32:32.000
..like it could ever make sense.

32:32.000 --> 32:32.920
..like it could ever make sense.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.200
Whole lifetimes spent hating,
and hurting people,

32:36.240 --> 32:38.440
because you're too weak.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.000
Too insecure.

32:40.000 --> 32:40.320
Too insecure.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.720
Too scared.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.880
What's happening to you?

32:47.680 --> 32:48.000
It feels like hate...
..and darkness.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.920
It feels like hate...
..and darkness.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.000
It wants to be let out.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.520
It wants to be let out.

32:57.560 --> 33:01.160
It wants you dead.
No. No, I don't want to die.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.000
Neither did I!

33:03.040 --> 33:04.000
Neither did Victoria.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.720
Neither did Victoria.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.480
Hey! Hey!

33:06.520 --> 33:11.120
Hey! Let me out of here! Let me out!

33:12.720 --> 33:15.320
I really wanted to hurt you...

33:15.360 --> 33:17.920
to make your heart beat so fast
that it stopped.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.000
I wanted to watch you die.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.520
I wanted to watch you die.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.200
But I won't let you change
who I am...

33:27.560 --> 33:28.000
..and I won't be defined
by what you did to me.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
..and I won't be defined
by what you did to me.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.840
I am so much more than that.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.120
No, no.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.120
Your greatest fear came true.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.000
You are...nothing...

33:52.600 --> 33:54.760
..with nobody.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.880
And that's how it's gonna be
for the rest of your life.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.000
What's the racket?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.080
What's the racket?

34:01.840 --> 34:04.240
C-C-Can't you see her?

34:05.880 --> 34:07.720
She's right there!

34:11.760 --> 34:13.960
Just keep it down.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.800
Did you say what you wanted to say?

34:40.720 --> 34:42.640
Yeah.

34:43.720 --> 34:45.720
Come on.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.000
The thing is...

35:20.000 --> 35:21.520
The thing is...

35:21.560 --> 35:23.880
I'm not as forgiving as Neve.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.000
Urgent assistance required.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.200
Urgent assistance required.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.800
I think it's over.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.440
What happens now?
I don't know.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.800
Can you stay?

36:25.280 --> 36:27.200
You know, I...

36:27.240 --> 36:29.760
I couldn't have got through this
without you.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.000
Had to step up sooner or later.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.480
Had to step up sooner or later.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.920
Well, you did.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.040
I know I didn't say this
very often...

36:46.840 --> 36:48.000
..but...I love you.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.560
..but...I love you.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.800
So much.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.640
I love you, too.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.320
Yeah.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.680
You OK?

37:47.720 --> 37:49.000
Yeah.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.000
Are you, though?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.400
Are you, though?

37:53.440 --> 37:54.920
Yes.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.040
You don't have to pretend.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.600
I wouldn't be OK.
I'd be...messed up.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.480
You ARE messed up,
so that makes two of us.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.000
Fair enough.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.320
Fair enough.

38:11.960 --> 38:16.000
I know my dad did terrible things...
but he was still my dad.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
I know my dad did terrible things...
but he was still my dad.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.120
I wish he'd been better at it.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.000
And that we maybe
could've figured things out.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.280
And that we maybe
could've figured things out.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.000
What will you do now?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.120
What will you do now?

38:35.400 --> 38:37.280
You know what I'd really love?

38:38.160 --> 38:40.000
You and me, on the back of a bike...

38:40.000 --> 38:41.360
You and me, on the back of a bike...

38:41.400 --> 38:45.040
just riding off...
wherever the road takes us.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.520
Riding for ever.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.720
Me, too.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.000
Can't happen though, can it?

38:56.000 --> 38:56.320
Can't happen though, can it?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.520
You know, I think...

39:00.760 --> 39:02.840
..we were brought together...

39:03.560 --> 39:04.000
..somehow...

39:04.000 --> 39:05.280
..somehow...

39:06.320 --> 39:08.400
..to help each other.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.000
But you have to live your life now.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.240
But you have to live your life now.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.000
What about you?

39:18.120 --> 39:20.000
I always knew
I was meant to be somewhere else.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.800
I always knew
I was meant to be somewhere else.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.120
It's time.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.000
I don't want you to be alone.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.520
I don't want you to be alone.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.720
I don't want that for you.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.000
I'll be OK.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.440
I'll be OK.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.320
How do you know that?

39:40.080 --> 39:41.760
I just feel it.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.000
Wherever I am...

40:08.000 --> 40:08.040
Wherever I am...

40:09.120 --> 40:11.120
..I'll be thinking about you.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.000
Maybe we'll see each other
again one day...

40:17.360 --> 40:19.360
..somewhere else.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.000
I'll be waiting.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.280
I'll be waiting.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.000
Oh! Are you joking? Oh!

41:36.000 --> 41:38.320
Oh! Are you joking? Oh!

41:39.960 --> 41:41.280
It was him!
Come on, then!

41:41.320 --> 41:43.960
It was him! No, no, no!
Not my phone, not my phone!

41:44.000 --> 41:46.920
No, no, no!
Not my phone!

41:46.960 --> 41:49.680
Hey! I will get both of you!
No, stop, stop! Ow!

41:49.720 --> 41:52.000
You're going down.
No!

41:52.000 --> 41:52.600
You're going down.
No!
