Pre v/ous/y 0/7
’Pretty Little Liars” ”

00:02.860 --> 00:04.896
- Can I talk to you?
— It's not a good time.

00:04.930 --> 00:06.488
Addison, there's no record
of you leaving sick yesterday.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.768
You're off the lineup
for Saturday's meet.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.438
You sure you wanna do that?

00:10.410 --> 00:12.833
— Will you marry me?
— Yes.

00:12.870 --> 00:15.236
—Ido.
—Ido.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.406
I'm going to have the baby.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.008
- Oh, we'll do it.
- Together.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.699
Wait, so are you two..
About time.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.479
— I have something for you?
— What is that?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.249
— This.
— The Lost Woods?

00:23.290 --> 00:25.315
I put the deed in your name.
Yours and Alison's.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.341
I'd like to go over
the major points one more time.

00:27.390 --> 00:30.052
— I killed Dr. Dunhill.
- She did this for you.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.581
[grunts]

00:33.630 --> 00:34.995
(Ca/eh)
We should turn her
over to the police.

00:35.030 --> 00:36.657
— Not like this.
- She killed Charlotte.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.464
- And she tried to kill Hanna.
- 'She didn't know who I was.'

00:43.070 --> 00:45.459
[doorbell ringing]

00:45.510 --> 00:46.659
(Spencer)
'He's dead.‘

00:46.710 --> 00:48.177
Did we end the game
or did Mary Drake?

00:48.210 --> 00:49.336
Mona did, when she told us

00:49.380 --> 00:51.200
'what happened to Charlotte.‘

00:52.710 --> 00:55.474
We saw Bridget Wu at
[indistinct]

00:55.520 --> 00:57.340
Hm. Was she drinking
out of her purse?

00:57.390 --> 01:00.348
— Hardly. It was a Vanderwaal.
— A Mona Vanderwaal?

01:00.390 --> 01:03.450
I hear her bags are going
for $1000.

01:03.490 --> 01:06.254
- 'Really?‘
— Good for her.

01:06.290 --> 01:08.554
I always knew
she would make it.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.124
Hello, ladies.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.092
(all)
Hey, Lucas.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.534
Ah. Can it get any hotter?

01:15.570 --> 01:18.459
Oh, if it does, I'm shoving
an ice pack down my panties.

01:18.510 --> 01:19.863
You know you can
actually buy those.

01:19.910 --> 01:23.334
— Ice panties?
— No, Aria, ice panty liners.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.372
I'm looking that up.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.571
Remember when we used
to look up murder weapons

01:28.620 --> 01:30.474
indistinctive traits
of psychopaths

01:30.520 --> 01:32.317
exhibiting signs
of hyper-reality disorder?

01:32.350 --> 01:34.284
(Aria)
'And that rush we got
when we thought we were close'

01:34.320 --> 01:35.787
'to finding out who A was.'

01:37.560 --> 01:40.859
That tingly feeling you get when
you know A was watching you.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.356
What tingly feeling was that?

01:42.400 --> 01:45.221
I just can't believe we never
figured out who it was.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.497
The other day,
someone asked me how it felt

01:48.540 --> 01:49.768
to be living a normal life

01:49.800 --> 01:51.802
and I've never been
more Insulted.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.232
Why do we miss A so much?

01:55.280 --> 01:57.669
Because without fear,
there can be no courage.

01:57.710 --> 02:00.702
- Who said that?
— Christopher Paolini.

02:01.820 --> 02:04.744
[instrumental music]

02:27.310 --> 02:28.800
[door opens]

02:28.840 --> 02:31.638
[dramatic music]

02:33.720 --> 02:35.176
[glass shattering]

02:39.450 --> 02:41.589
I never would've guessed
it was you.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.456
Are you here to kill me?

02:50.930 --> 02:53.421
Got a secret_
can you keep It

02:53.470 --> 02:56.189
Swear this one you'll save

02:56.240 --> 02:58.504
Better lock it
in your pocket

02:58.540 --> 03:01.236
Taking this one to the grave

03:01.280 --> 03:03.601
If I show you
then I know you

03:03.650 --> 03:06.210
Won't tell what I said

03:06.250 --> 03:08.571
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:08.620 --> 03:11.214
If one of them is dead

03:13.290 --> 03:15.713
Can we just take a second
to appreciate

03:15.760 --> 03:18.251
this Robert Redford,
Barbra Streisand

03:18.290 --> 03:19.723
"The Way We Were" moment?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.853
Didn't they break up
in that movie?

03:21.900 --> 03:24.494
Oh, yeah, but in my head,
the new wife dies

03:24.530 --> 03:26.691
and then they just
get back together.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.832
— What_?
— Nothing. It'SJust, um..

03:33.170 --> 03:34.603
This is the best week ever.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.471
Our book might become a movie

03:36.510 --> 03:39.445
and you're about
to become my wife.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.004
Hey, if you don't stop
looking at me like that

03:41.050 --> 03:44.144
I'm never gonna be able to say
our vows without that ugly cry.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.589
You kind of are an ugly crier.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.453
Oh, okay, I can say that.
You cannot say that.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.913
I, no, I love your ugly cry.
Makes you unique.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.758
Right. Okay, don't try
and talk yourself out of it.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.927
I'm done.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.895
[instrumental music]

04:07.410 --> 04:09.878
Alright, here you go.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.872
You know what else I know?
You don't like peas.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.809
It's awful, isn't it?
What about you, Grace?

04:17.850 --> 04:20.683
Grace, ah,
do you wanna try the peas?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.654
You wanna.. No?

04:22.690 --> 04:24.157
Okay, why do I get the feeling

04:24.190 --> 04:27.057
'both of your first words
are gonna be "No?"'

04:27.100 --> 04:28.852
Alright. Hi.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.323
— Can you please pick up Lily?
— Of course.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.520
— Come on.
— I can't stay for very long.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.095
I have that meeting
with Jen Gerstenblatt.

04:36.140 --> 04:38.335
— Oh, right.
— Oh, good girl.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.406
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.034
Mm. Bye, Lily. Bye, Grace.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.448
— Come here.
— Oh, good girl.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.619
— Good girl. I love you.
— I love you too.

04:48.650 --> 04:50.447
— Bye.
— Alright.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.009
'Okay, it's gonna be a fun day.'

04:55.060 --> 04:56.789
'Isn't it? Yes.‘

05:08.100 --> 05:10.591
— Thanks for coming so early.
— Yeah, of course.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.858
She doesn't know
you're here, right?

05:12.910 --> 05:15.105
No. I hate lying to her.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.746
Oh, yeah, but she'll find out
the truth soon enough.

05:18.780 --> 05:21.374
You know,
it's, it's important to me.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.672
You're giving me peace of mind.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.041
Just knowing that
Emily's gonna be taken care of.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.114
Like I promised you

05:29.160 --> 05:30.957
I will always be here for her.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.158
Thank you.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.259
You know, I was thinking about
staying in town for a while.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.289
- Really?
— Mm-hmm.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.888
That's great.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.398
I feel like we're just starting
to get to know each other again.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.567
Me too.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.498
But I was hoping you'd consider

05:45.540 --> 05:48.259
swapping the barn
for your old room?

05:48.310 --> 05:49.777
Whoa.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.178
Fine. You win.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.778
But just this once.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.848
I'm kidding.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.459
[instrumental music]

06:08.900 --> 06:10.527
Can I help you?

06:13.100 --> 06:15.330
[chuckling]
Toby.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.928
'What are you doing here?‘

06:20.280 --> 06:21.907
Hey.

06:21.940 --> 06:25.808
Oh I've been longing
to see you

06:25.850 --> 06:27.147
Ali said she talked to Jason.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.772
You weren't coming back
for the wedding.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.879
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't
planning on it, but we ﬁnished

06:30.920 --> 06:33.548
the well in Karambe
ahead of schedule and I..

06:33.590 --> 06:36.058
Decided to hike back
from Africa?

06:36.090 --> 06:38.558
Uh, I didn't know
if I was ready to come back

06:38.590 --> 06:42.253
so _I flew to New York
and Ijust, I started walking.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.858
Wasn't sure where I'd end up.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.520
How are you doing?

06:49.240 --> 06:50.798
Who's this?

06:52.340 --> 06:53.967
This is Bashful.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.675
— So, he's a little shy?
— Yeah, he's a rescue.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.477
[clicking tongue]

07:04.520 --> 07:06.511
But be careful though,
so far I'm the only person

07:06.550 --> 07:08.245
he's trusted enough
to get close to.

07:08.290 --> 07:09.587
Hello.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.159
Okay.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.828
That's a first.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.457
Hi.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.663
Easy. Easy. It's alright.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.907
It's alright, it's alright.
It's okay.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.668
Shh. It's okay.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.235
Um, hey, if you,
uh, give me a minute

07:30.280 --> 07:33.204
I can give you a lift back
into town, if you want?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.569
What can I help you with?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.611
Uh, can you throw that
in the truck?

07:38.920 --> 07:41.753
Yeah. I saw it on eBay
and I couldn't resist.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.579
Oh I've been longing
to see you

07:47.630 --> 07:49.951
Yeah. Good boy.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.892
You've been on my mind
talk about a lonely time

07:54.940 --> 07:57.932
You don't know
how much I need you

07:57.970 --> 08:00.063
_ Orson Welles said _
that If you want a happy ending

08:00.110 --> 08:02.874
that depends, of course,
on where you stop your story.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.299
So how does that theme
relate to the ending

08:05.350 --> 08:06.977
of "Then And Now?"

08:07.020 --> 08:10.012
Emerson, maybe we should give
someone else a chance?

08:12.590 --> 08:14.319
Luke?

08:14.360 --> 08:17.818
It's like when you finish a book
and you don't want it to end.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.122
'Even though
the characters are happy'

08:19.160 --> 08:21.924
you're still sad
that it's ending.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.029
Exactly.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.357
Isn't your friend
the reason the book

08:24.400 --> 08:26.493
doesn't have a happy ending?

08:26.530 --> 08:29.090
She stole Ezra from Nicole.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.562
They were hooking up
while she was rotting away--

08:30.610 --> 08:32.566
That's enough, Addison.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.202
It's just my opinion.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.879
— Lesbo. _
— Excuse me, what did you say?

08:40.180 --> 08:43.069
[bell ringing]

08:43.120 --> 08:45.918
[indistinct chatter]

08:54.760 --> 08:57.695
You may think
you're winning the battle

08:57.730 --> 09:00.324
but I'll win the war.

09:00.370 --> 09:03.794
Careful, Ali.
You don't wanna leave a bruise.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.002
I could bury you with that.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.701
But then again,
it wouldn't be the first time

09:08.740 --> 09:11.072
someone buried you.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.044
It's Miss DiLaurentis.

09:19.190 --> 09:22.614
Hey, how did your meeting
with Mrs. Gerstenblatt go?

09:22.660 --> 09:25.128
Oh, um, she had to reschedule.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.796
Between the two of us,
we have to know someone

09:29.830 --> 09:32.128
who knows someone
who can take care of her.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.062
[intense music]

09:45.980 --> 09:48.813
Claire, are you okay?

09:49.520 --> 09:50.839
I'm fine.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.158
Is Addison bullying you?

09:58.190 --> 10:02.229
She's not. I'm fine.
I'm just late for class.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.353
[bell ringing]

10:09.700 --> 10:12.134
Addison, is that you?

10:12.170 --> 10:14.536
You should get to class.
That was the last bell.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.038
Some of us can see...and hear.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.342
So go.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.241
Now.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.747
Yes, ma'am.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.309
I may not be able to see

10:31.360 --> 10:33.885
but I can smell a bitch
from a mile away.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.297
And I thought you used
to be the mean girl.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.508
[sighs]
I'm sure she makes
a kick-ass life skills teacher

10:48.540 --> 10:50.576
but she still creeps me out.

10:50.610 --> 10:54.205
We stayed in Rosewood for her
and I supported that.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.377
You have spent countless nights
visiting her

10:56.420 --> 10:57.409
and I supported that too.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.281
Caleb, it's not for eternity.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.140
It's just until
she finishes therapy.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.418
And how long is that gonna be?

11:02.460 --> 11:03.757
[cell phone beeps]

11:05.990 --> 11:08.220
It's Welby.
They just dropped off Mona.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.990
— She's on her way up.
- We were doing so well, Hanna.

11:11.030 --> 11:14.295
With your designs taking off and
me selling my software to Lucas.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.467
We bought the loft.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.661
[knocking on door]

11:18.710 --> 11:20.905
I'm gonna get ready
for the party.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.976
You're not even
gomg to say hello?

11:31.490 --> 11:33.014
Hi. I was getting worried.

11:33.050 --> 11:35.450
Ithought
maybe you changed your mind.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.856
No. No, of course not.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.888
So..

11:50.940 --> 11:53.568
...how do you feel
about Thai takeout for dinner?

11:53.610 --> 11:55.134
Oh, Mona, we have

11:55.180 --> 11:57.671
the bachelor-bachelorette party
tonight.

11:57.710 --> 12:00.873
— I told you. Remember?
— I'm sorry.

12:00.920 --> 12:05.710
Um, with the meds, I'm not
as sharp as I used to be.

12:07.090 --> 12:09.581

24:46.610 --> 24:49.204
_It's been weeks_
Since your last VlSlt.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.717
I'm sorry.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.008
I missed you, too, mom.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.253
(Ezra)
l/l/e ’re gonna get through this.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.756
I'm sorry.

25:04.460 --> 25:07.020
Tomorrow's supposed to be one of
the happiest days of our lives.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.288
It will be.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.161
You still plannin' on marryin'
me tomorrow, right?

25:14.370 --> 25:16.577
Then nothing's changed.

25:16.610 --> 25:18.532
I love you

25:18.580 --> 25:20.002
and we are going
to have a family.

25:20.050 --> 25:23.872
We will...adopt
or we get a surrogate.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.981
We'll do whatever we have to.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.785
Okay?

25:40.030 --> 25:41.691
How are you doing?

25:41.740 --> 25:43.890
Everyday is a challenge.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.704
But I try
and keep my spirits up.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.731
I try not to lose hope.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.937
You can say it.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.107
Hope breeds eternal misery.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.711
Well, the old Spencer
would have agreed with you

25:57.750 --> 26:01.584
but...I don't believe
that anymore.

26:03.290 --> 26:05.087
How are you holding up?

26:08.460 --> 26:10.724
I need your help.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.593
[indistinct chatter]

26:15.370 --> 26:17.031
Excuse me.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.231
— Hey, sweetheart.
— Hey, mom.

26:22.340 --> 26:27.368
Uh, Mona, I didn't know
you would be coming tonight.

26:27.410 --> 26:29.776
Neither did I.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.811
Well, we thought it was
a good opportunity for Mona

26:31.850 --> 26:34.683
to come _here
and reconnect With everyone.

26:37.260 --> 26:38.887
Drinks?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.579
I'm not allowed to have alcohol

26:40.630 --> 26:43.258
but I could go
for a cocktail wiener.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.838
- Hanna, what were you thinking?
— Are you nuts?

26:50.870 --> 26:53.065
[sighs]
You two take over from here.

26:53.110 --> 26:55.169
Why would you bring her here?

26:55.210 --> 26:57.929
Why would you bring her
to my rehearsal dinner?

26:57.980 --> 27:00.949
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't know what else to do.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.470
Caleb doesn't wanna
leave Mona home alone

27:02.520 --> 27:05.011
and it's hard to find a sitter
for someone in their mid 20$.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.779
Hanna, the last time
we saw Mona

27:06.820 --> 27:08.685
she tried to push you
off the bell tower.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.859
Yeah, and she feels bad
about that.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.279
Can we just pretend for
one night that she's a friend?

27:13.330 --> 27:14.922
Who are we pretending
as a friend?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.656
— Mona. _ .
— 'You guys, I'm begging you.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.692
Please, for one night,
can you just fake it?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.631
I can do that.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.703
Hm? What is this?

27:32.750 --> 27:37.073
This is a 40-year-old
single malt scotch.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.543
It's a wedding present
from my grandfather

27:39.590 --> 27:41.740
and I've hidden the bottle
in the back.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.588
Wow, this is, um..

27:44.620 --> 27:46.087
Cheers.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.858
Aah!

27:49.900 --> 27:52.357
I never asked
for your blessing.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.322
Well, if that's what's
happening now, I gotta say

27:54.370 --> 27:56.361
you've left it down
to the wire.

27:57.740 --> 28:01.039
I never asked
because I never really felt

28:01.070 --> 28:05.700
like you and Ella
truly accepted me.

28:07.250 --> 28:11.175
Well, you, you never really
worked to prove us wrong.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.311
You never made
a persuaswe argument

28:14.350 --> 28:17.683
as to why we should feel good
about you as a son-in-law.

28:20.030 --> 28:24.023
And I guess that's why
we do...feel good about it.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.968
Instead of trying
to make us happy

28:28.000 --> 28:30.992
you've focused
on making Aria happy.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.569
And she is.

28:34.610 --> 28:37.408
So, yeah, you get my blessing.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.168
And you've had it
for a while now.

28:42.150 --> 28:45.074
Just don't screw it up.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.246
Thank you.

28:47.790 --> 28:51.055
I would never serve my guests
cocktail wieners.

28:51.090 --> 28:53.456
Those are
foie gras
nuggets.

28:53.490 --> 28:54.855
And they are delicious.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.994
I mean, really,
it was just a joke.

28:58.030 --> 29:01.591
Well, it wasn't funny.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.993
Right.

29:05.110 --> 29:08.364
Hi, can I have a giant glass
of pinot grigio, please?

29:08.410 --> 29:11.129
Thanks. You can just leave
that bottle right there too.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.740
— Right. Yeah, there.
— 'Here you are.‘

29:13.780 --> 29:15.441
It's that bad?

29:15.480 --> 29:16.970
If I didn't love Aria so much

29:17.020 --> 29:19.443
I would strangle that woman
with her own pearls.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.344
Peter's_ mother
was pretentious like that.

29:21.390 --> 29:23.278
Ate a slice of pizza
with a knife and fork.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.459
I eat pizza
with a knife and fork.

29:27.290 --> 29:29.485
When I told Dianne
that we weren't members

29:29.530 --> 29:32.693
of the Country Club, she looked
at me like I spit out a tooth.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.095
Your fingers don't get greasy

29:34.130 --> 29:36.234
and the cheese
doesn't slide out.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.131
Sometimes I wish we were
still in the basement.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.331
At least then we had
some peace and qwet.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.870
Oh, my God.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.798
You remember
how we got out of there?

29:47.150 --> 29:50.415
You know, Pam didn't drink
for a year after that.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.145
- Forget I brought it up.
- 'Yeah.‘

29:52.190 --> 29:54.146
— Cheers.
— Cheers.

29:55.820 --> 29:57.788
So, when do I get
to meet the girls?

29:57.820 --> 29:59.310
Anytime you wanna babysit.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.453
With four girls in the house,
we could use a nanny.

30:01.490 --> 30:04.197
[chuckles]
Hey, call it whatever you want

30:04.230 --> 30:06.596
just know
I'm always here for you.

30:06.630 --> 30:07.824
Thanks.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.867
I'll, uh, be right back.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.405
- Hadley, Willa.
— Hi, Miss Fields.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.840
Hi. Well, uh, can I
talk to you, ladies?

30:19.880 --> 30:21.142
- Uh, we're working.
- Okay.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.807
Well, you can tell your boss
we're talkin'

30:22.850 --> 30:25.318
about Rumaki spheres.

30:25.350 --> 30:29.241
Look, Willa, I've known you
since you volunteered at the Y.

30:29.290 --> 30:32.259
And, Hadley, I know it's hard
being the new girl at school

30:32.290 --> 30:34.429
but you still have a choice
in who you make friends with.

30:34.460 --> 30:37.497
Is this about Addison?
Because she is nice to me.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.964
And I don't wanna be
on the other side of that.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.991
Your aunt
had a real confidence to her

30:42.040 --> 30:43.837
and that's what I loved.

30:43.870 --> 30:45.895
Maya was kind.

30:45.940 --> 30:48.408
She picked me.
It wasn't the other way around.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.170
And you don't say no
to someone like Addison.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.940
I mean, she'd have
to be, like, dead first.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.359
[indistinct chattering]

31:11.100 --> 31:13.660
- You're takin' off?
- Oh, yeah.

31:13.700 --> 31:17.033
Somehow I got roped into being
my mom's designated driver.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.629
What are you doing on Sunday?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.671
I'm going riding.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.941
You want company?
I told you I'd give it a try.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.743
Yeah, that was
like six years ago.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.374
Well, maybe I just took some
time to get used to the idea.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.548
I meant to congratulate you
on winning the game.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.181
We never finished it.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.585
You did while I was asleep.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.421
I didn't know
the word though. I..

31:45.470 --> 31:47.722
Oh, I don't even remember
which word I put down.

31:47.770 --> 31:49.067
Limerance.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.304
I looked it up.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.762
You did?

31:54.810 --> 31:56.630
Kind of unrequited love.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.379
Yeah.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.378
Thank you for driving,
sweetheart.

32:01.410 --> 32:03.310
- Oh, yeah.
- We have to..

32:03.350 --> 32:05.716
We have to make
a couple of extra stops.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.240
- Okay.
— Hi, Toby.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.144
— Hey.
— I call shotgun.

32:09.190 --> 32:11.454
— Oh.
— Watch it.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.363
I know _it's none
of my busmess, but..

32:25.410 --> 32:28.231
...don't take for granted
the people who love you the most

32:28.270 --> 32:31.330
just because
they sometimes let you.

32:31.380 --> 32:32.802
What does that even mean?

32:32.850 --> 32:35.705
You're my daughter and I will
always be on your side.

32:37.220 --> 32:40.519
Even when you're wrong.
I can't help it.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.689
So you think
I'm wrong about Mona?

32:44.090 --> 32:46.217
You agree with Caleb?

32:50.230 --> 32:53.119
But I'm still on your side.

32:53.170 --> 32:56.128
Oh, Marin, will you get
in the car?

32:56.170 --> 32:58.297
— Love you.
— Love you, mom.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.407
Pile in.

33:10.950 --> 33:13.168
It's finally happening.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.780
This is a little surreal.

33:15.820 --> 33:16.889
I know.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.411
We're actually getting married.

33:20.890 --> 33:22.380
Hey, Aria.

33:24.030 --> 33:26.351
It would_ be
really encouraging for me

33:26.400 --> 33:28.595
if every time we bring up
the topic of our wedding

33:28.640 --> 33:30.892
you don't look like you're
about to burst into tears.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.237
I'm sorry.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.498
I can't help it,
I mean, just sitting there

33:35.540 --> 33:38.429
listening
to your family's toasts.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.801
Your dad, even your brother,
talking about our kids

33:40.850 --> 33:43.068
I just..

33:43.120 --> 33:44.849
I just feel like
I'm letting people down.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.213
Stop. We have options.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.218
I remember
a friend of the family.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.613
She's a fertility specialist.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.719
After this weekend's done,
we'll go to her.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.749
We'll get a second opinion--

33:54.790 --> 33:56.553
This was a second opinion.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.090
In fact, it was
the third opinion.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.449
I went to two other doctors

33:59.500 --> 34:01.024
and they said the same thing.

34:01.070 --> 34:03.288
They did?

34:03.340 --> 34:05.433
How, how long have you known?

34:05.470 --> 34:07.165
I just wanted
to be sure before—-

34:07.210 --> 34:08.837
How long have you known?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.871
A few weeks?

34:10.910 --> 34:13.105
A little bit longer than that.

34:16.050 --> 34:17.312
I, I don't understand.

34:17.350 --> 34:18.942
Ithought
that we were supposed

34:18.990 --> 34:20.617
to go through
these things together--

34:20.650 --> 34:22.413
Yeah, I was scared.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.455
I-I thought that
maybe this was

34:25.490 --> 34:27.879
something that
you couldn't get past.

34:27.930 --> 34:31.422
Wow, if you think
so little of me

34:31.460 --> 34:33.018
why do you still wanna marry me?

34:33.070 --> 34:36.699
It wasn't about you,
it was about me.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.662
Can you understand that?

34:40.970 --> 34:43.507
Yes. You're right. I can.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.178
I'm sorry,
I'm-I'm just tired

34:45.210 --> 34:47.701
and it's _been
a very emotional day.

34:49.250 --> 34:52.742
Okay. Come upstairs,
let's talk.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.143
No, I..

34:55.790 --> 34:58.281
I think what I need is sleep.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.254
We're gonna be okay.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.725
I just wish that you had
as much faith in me

35:03.760 --> 35:06.422
as I have in you.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.791
— I love you.
— I love you too.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.267
But it's not really
the same thing, is it?

35:33.390 --> 35:34.789
What, are they still sleeping?

35:34.830 --> 35:36.127
Yeah.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.095
You've barely said two words
to me all night.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.630
That's not true.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.461
Well, either you're enterin'
a vegetative state

35:48.510 --> 35:50.307
or you're pissed at me.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.270
I saw you with my mom
at the party.

35:53.310 --> 35:55.244
What were you whispering about?

35:56.650 --> 35:59.244
I don't know. I mean,
it was pretty loud in there.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.509
She put something in your purse.
What was it?

36:02.560 --> 36:05.279
I don't know.
Breath mints?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.059
I mean, your mom's
pretty passive aggressive

36:07.090 --> 36:08.421
and there were onions
on those sliders.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.189
My mom avoided me all night.

36:10.230 --> 36:12.221
— What is going on?
— Nothing.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.226
Ali, we're not going to sleep

36:14.270 --> 36:17.535
until you tell me
what's in that purse.

36:17.570 --> 36:18.867
[sighs]

36:18.910 --> 36:21.504
Remind me to never throw you
a surprise party.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.643
This is my grandmother's ring.

36:36.020 --> 36:39.456
I had this whole romantic
proposal planned

36:39.490 --> 36:41.526
and it didn't include
a pug sweatshirt

36:41.560 --> 36:44.950
but I guess
I'll just wing it.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.922
You wanna propose to me?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.504
Well, I'm still trying to, so..

36:54.540 --> 36:57.771
A thousand miles of walking

36:59.350 --> 37:02.478
Across the deadly sea

37:04.480 --> 37:06.744
When I was at my most

37:06.790 --> 37:10.248
lonely and unhappy
and angry place..

37:11.790 --> 37:14.156
...you loved me.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.590
And when I was
an ugly human being..

37:18.060 --> 37:19.994
...you saw a beautiful soul.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.698
You make the world
a better place

37:23.740 --> 37:26.959
because you see the good in it.

37:27.010 --> 37:31.470
And you make me a better woman
because you searched for one.

37:34.780 --> 37:38.272
I've known my days
without you

37:38.320 --> 37:40.584
Do you promise..

37:40.620 --> 37:43.282
...to do that everyday
for the rest of our lives?

37:44.960 --> 37:46.518
Yes.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.121
Beside you

37:50.160 --> 37:54.426
I wanna call my home

37:54.470 --> 37:57.598
— I love you.
— I love you too.

38:00.710 --> 38:04.202
(man on TV)
'And here we are
in less than 15 minutes'

38:04.240 --> 38:06.401
'perfectly fried chicken.‘

38:06.450 --> 38:09.544
Tender, juicy,
and bursting with flavor.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.116
The secret is
cooking at a high..

38:11.150 --> 38:13.618
Hey, you're awake?

38:14.850 --> 38:16.841
Yeah, I'm not tired.

38:16.890 --> 38:20.348
- What are you watching?
— I can't tell.

38:20.390 --> 38:22.278
It's either a really
bad comedy about chefs

38:22.330 --> 38:25.322
or a really good infomercial
about deep fryers.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.390
Can we talk?

38:30.540 --> 38:33.498
I don't know
what else to say, Hanna.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.861
The decisions you make
don't just affect you.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.074
Actually, let's not talk.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.577
— Hanna.
—Hm?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.947
I hear you, okay?

38:48.990 --> 38:52.289
I'm gonna tell Mona
that it's not gonna work out.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.286
I'm not sayin'
you can't help her.

38:54.330 --> 38:56.127
I'll help you help her.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.288
— We just need our own space.
— I know.

38:59.330 --> 39:01.594
I'll tell her first thing
in the morning.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.838
You can deal with Mona
until then, right?

39:04.870 --> 39:06.497
Sure.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.735
How much damage can she do
in one night?

39:13.550 --> 39:16.075
— I love you.
— I love you too.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.445
Under the spell
of a shivering sky

39:23.490 --> 39:25.811
You wanna make a baby?

39:25.860 --> 39:28.385
— Now?
- Yeah.

39:30.460 --> 39:34.499
That's where I find you

39:37.770 --> 39:39.658
You could just
leave the cart outside.

39:41.110 --> 39:42.532
[knock on door]

39:52.080 --> 39:55.447
Coffee? At this hour?

39:55.490 --> 39:57.014
You'll be up all night.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.554
You don't need
nobody else but me

40:01.590 --> 40:05.799
Give you all you want
and more

40:05.830 --> 40:10.369
Cover me up
in my favorite things

40:21.450 --> 40:25.614
The way you turn me on

40:25.650 --> 40:29.211
The way you make me

40:29.260 --> 40:34.186
You you you

40:36.860 --> 40:39.988
So unpredictable

40:41.630 --> 40:45.862
Don't you dare let this go

40:45.910 --> 40:50.233
The way you turn me on

40:50.280 --> 40:54.273
The way you make me love

40:54.310 --> 40:56.449
Cradling me

41:05.730 --> 41:08.187
[piano music]

41:23.240 --> 41:25.504
Toby, is that you?

41:35.190 --> 41:36.646
Mona.

41:41.490 --> 41:43.424
Deja vu,
bitch.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.722
[grunts]

41:52.610 --> 41:54.100
[sighs]

41:58.510 --> 41:59.772
[coughs]

42:04.550 --> 42:07.087
[breathes heavily]

42:29.780 --> 42:32.305
[dramatic music]

42:34.310 --> 42:36.949
— Bool
— Ughi

42:36.980 --> 42:38.208
[laughs]

42:39.820 --> 42:42.448
We didn't think
you'd wake up so soon, Spencer.

42:42.490 --> 42:43.957
Mary?

42:47.190 --> 42:48.748
[grunts]

42:52.770 --> 42:54.260
Sweet dreams.

43:02.110 --> 43:05.876
I really need
your discretion on this.

43:05.910 --> 43:07.343
Clearly,
it was very last minute.

43:07.380 --> 43:10.406
Um, so if you could
just keep it quiet?

43:10.450 --> 43:12.179
Yeah, thank you.

43:17.190 --> 43:19.613
— Ezra.
— Hey.

43:19.660 --> 43:21.878
— Hi.
— What are you doing here?

43:25.670 --> 43:27.194
What do you mean she escaped?

43:27.230 --> 43:29.198
We don't have the details,
but we'll stay

43:29.240 --> 43:31.265
in constant touch
with the state police.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.995
And if Mary Drake does try
to reach out to you--

43:33.040 --> 43:35.668
Oh, this has to be a joke.
Right?

43:35.710 --> 43:38.270
I mean, our friend's
getting married today.

43:38.310 --> 43:39.470
This can't be happening.

43:39.510 --> 43:41.842
Officer Maple,
if she does try and contact us

43:41.880 --> 43:43.745
I-I promise
we'll let you know immediately.

43:43.780 --> 43:45.543
You should know
she's probably not alone.

43:45.580 --> 43:46.979
She needed help to get out.

43:47.020 --> 43:49.648
So you and your friends
should stay vigilant.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.930
[machine beeps]

44:08.640 --> 44:10.267
[gaSPS]

44:13.450 --> 44:16.078
Oh, well, you missed breakfast

44:16.120 --> 44:18.839
but mum's planning
a special lunch.

44:22.190 --> 44:25.057
I don't _even know
what question to ask ﬁrst.

44:25.090 --> 44:26.159
Who are you?

44:26.190 --> 44:28.681
[laughs]
Really?

44:28.730 --> 44:30.925
How hard did Mona hit you?

44:32.470 --> 44:35.223
You wanna know who I am?

44:35.270 --> 44:38.637
I'm just a girl who met a man
when he came in from the rain.

44:38.670 --> 44:40.433
[rock music]

44:42.010 --> 44:44.137
[indistinct chatter]

45:01.730 --> 45:03.686
Spencer?

45:03.730 --> 45:06.119
— What are you doing here?
- Sorry.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.797
Think you have me confused
with someone else.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.128
Oh, nice try, but sadly,
it hasn't been so long

45:10.170 --> 45:11.899
that you can pretend
like you don't know who I am.

45:11.940 --> 45:15.535
I'd remember if we met, love.
I promise you that.

45:15.570 --> 45:18.471
Alright, Spence, you gotta stop
this. You're freaking me out.

45:18.510 --> 45:20.171
Sorry, if you're trying
to have a crack at me

45:20.210 --> 45:22.349
I must admit this is a new one.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.268
Now will it be a pint?

45:26.890 --> 45:28.243
Are you alright?

45:28.290 --> 45:30.349
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

45:30.390 --> 45:31.857
Who are you?

45:31.890 --> 45:34.927
Alex. Alex Straight.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.121
Are you going to order
something or not?

45:39.600 --> 45:41.727
Yeah, I'll have a v-vodka soda.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.897
Okay.

45:48.740 --> 45:50.605
I didn't know about you.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.699
I didn't know about Charlotte.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.105
I didn't even know
about Mary Drake.

45:55.150 --> 45:57.573
'At first, I thought
Wren was putting me on.'

45:57.620 --> 45:59.372
'But then he pulled out
his phone'

45:59.420 --> 46:01.980
showed me your picture.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.887
I still don't know why,
but I started to cry.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.749
He just ran into you?

46:09.800 --> 46:11.950
At a bar?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.059
I was in shock.

46:14.100 --> 46:16.989
'And I had a list of questions
about a mile long.‘

46:17.040 --> 46:19.531
'It took Wren days to tell me
everything he knew.‘

46:19.570 --> 46:22.801
'I've never felt so close
to someone so fast.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.569
And he felt the same way.

46:24.610 --> 46:26.009
Melissa was already
out of the picture.

46:26.050 --> 46:27.506
She was dating some composer.

46:27.550 --> 46:30.246
So he was fair game.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.373
I guess you could say
he has a type.

46:32.420 --> 46:37.289
You know, first her,
then you, then her, then me.

46:40.260 --> 46:43.627
Yeah, it's a lot to process.
Would you like a sedative?

46:43.660 --> 46:45.992
Is Wren a part of this?

46:46.030 --> 46:49.227
The threats, the torture,
your twisted board game?

46:49.270 --> 46:53.661
After Charlotte died,
I needed closure.

46:53.710 --> 46:55.905
I wanted it on my own terms.

46:57.180 --> 46:58.670
Wren let me come
to Rosewood alone

46:58.710 --> 47:01.577
'cause he knew
that I would come back to him.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.498
And after I found out
who killed Charlotte

47:03.550 --> 47:05.279
that's just what I did.

47:05.320 --> 47:07.015
Yet here you are.

47:07.050 --> 47:08.813
Now I know
this isn't fun for you

47:08.850 --> 47:11.978
but it's very exciting for me.

47:12.020 --> 47:15.228
You see,
I've been dying to meet you.

47:15.260 --> 47:17.125
[screams]

47:17.160 --> 47:18.320
[laughs]

47:18.360 --> 47:21.693
Yeah, well,
you could've just called.

47:21.730 --> 47:24.233
That is such _
a cla55ic Spencer line.

47:24.270 --> 47:27.569
[laughs]
Oh, I'll be sure to use it.

47:27.610 --> 47:30.101
If I'm in here because
you're pretending to be me

47:30.140 --> 47:31.971
my friends are gonna
figure it out.

47:32.010 --> 47:33.136
'You're never gonna
pull this off.‘

47:33.180 --> 47:35.375
I've already pulled it off.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.484
— Spencer.
- You've got this.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.283
You're gonna be okay.

47:44.890 --> 47:48.621
— I think I'm dying here.
— No, I won't let that happen.

47:48.660 --> 47:51.197
[instrumental music]

48:01.440 --> 48:04.136
Toby, can I kiss you?

48:05.540 --> 48:08.100
Just one last time.

48:08.150 --> 48:09.879
Just to say goodbye.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.969
[music continues]

48:30.940 --> 48:32.589
(Spencer)
Like mother, like daughter.

48:33.940 --> 48:37.159
That's what you and Mary
were arguing about.

48:37.210 --> 48:39.337
She pretended to be Jessica
to sleep with my father

48:39.380 --> 48:42.907
and now you're pretending
to be me to sleep with Toby?

48:42.950 --> 48:44.713
What does Wren think about that?

48:44.750 --> 48:46.547
Oh, he doesn't care anymore.

48:46.590 --> 48:49.684
But there was a time when
Wren would do anything for me.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.917
Look, I made you a promise and
you know what that means to me.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.450
— I keep my word.
— Oh, Alex, come on.

48:54.490 --> 48:56.481
Are you ready to do
all this for sure then?

48:56.530 --> 48:57.895
I know you loved
your sister, but--

48:57.930 --> 49:00.319
No, those bitches
took her away from me

49:00.370 --> 49:02.361
and now they're getting
everything that they deserve.

49:04.070 --> 49:06.197
I'm honoring her.
Don't you get that?

49:06.240 --> 49:09.630
I get everything about you.
And I miss you.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.102
I miss us.

49:13.010 --> 49:14.648
Ezra!

49:14.680 --> 49:17.069
Oh, God.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.610
— Hey.'
— 'Hey.

49:18.650 --> 49:22.086
I don't think
you've ever met Wren Kingston.

49:22.120 --> 49:25.715
Uh, Ezra, this is Wren.
Wren, this is Ezra Fitz.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.318
— Hello.
— Pleasure.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.526
I made good on my promise
to Wren that night.

49:31.560 --> 49:34.427
And when the game was over,
I went back to London.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.895
But I just..

49:38.940 --> 49:42.034
I couldn't stop thinkin'
about you.

49:42.070 --> 49:44.379
About how good you have it.

49:44.410 --> 49:47.129
About how much
your friends love you.

49:47.180 --> 49:49.808
And it was just driving me mad

49:49.850 --> 49:52.910
and, and Wren saw it happening.

49:52.950 --> 49:55.111
Alex, you mean everything to me.

49:55.150 --> 49:56.947
I even created lies for you,
but this is too much—-

49:56.990 --> 49:58.685
You said it yourself, Wren.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.449
Okay, it was the luck
of the draw.

50:00.490 --> 50:02.355
Spencer got everything
and I got nothing.

50:02.390 --> 50:04.824
You have Charlotte's money now.
Isn't that enough?

50:04.860 --> 50:07.090
This isn't about money, okay?

50:07.130 --> 50:09.724
This is about having
a home and parents

50:09.770 --> 50:12.989
and friends who risk their lives
for each other.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.405
Even when they make mistakes

50:14.440 --> 50:16.237
even when they make
huge mistakes

50:16.280 --> 50:18.840
they still love each other.
I just..

50:18.880 --> 50:20.677
Please, I want to know
what that feels like.

50:20.710 --> 50:22.701
— So you tell them the truth.
— Come on.

50:22.750 --> 50:25.071
And when they hear your story,
they'll understand.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.112
You're joking, right? After
everything I put them through.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.447
- 'You're joking.‘
— Oh, Alex, come on.

50:29.490 --> 50:32.254
I can never be one of them.
Not as Alex.

50:35.690 --> 50:38.295
Wren, do you love me?

50:40.100 --> 50:42.227
Till death do us apart.

50:50.940 --> 50:53.238
Oh, come on! Alex!

50:53.280 --> 50:56.147
If you love me, then shoot me.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.676
Please, Wren.

51:02.550 --> 51:05.212
— Whoa.
— Please shoot me.

51:05.260 --> 51:07.387
— Come_on then.
— This is crazy.

51:07.430 --> 51:10.524
Please, Wren, I have to look
exactly like her.

51:12.030 --> 51:13.452
Please.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.060
Okay.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.536
— 'Please, Wren.‘
— Ah!

51:25.780 --> 51:27.008
'Please, Wren!‘

51:27.050 --> 51:29.109
[grunts]

51:29.150 --> 51:31.675
— I can't do this!
— Do it!

51:31.720 --> 51:33.312
[gunshot]

51:34.590 --> 51:35.716
[gaSPS]

51:36.820 --> 51:38.811
Oh..

51:38.860 --> 51:40.555
— Hey.
— It's okay.

51:40.590 --> 51:44.048
Igot you I
, got you,
I got you..

51:44.100 --> 51:47.092
The plan was to be you.

51:47.130 --> 51:48.768
With Wren.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.530
But no matter what,
he always thought of me as Alex

51:51.570 --> 51:55.461
and I just,
I didn't wanna be her anymore.

51:55.510 --> 51:59.037
So you, you broke up with him?

51:59.080 --> 52:01.799
No. No, I can never do that.

52:03.080 --> 52:05.116
But he is always close by.

52:07.150 --> 52:09.744
_ Iturned his ashes
into an eternity stone.

52:11.960 --> 52:14.155
Because diamonds last forever.

52:17.360 --> 52:20.397
Sorry, I've got to go get ready.

52:20.430 --> 52:22.625
Um, hey, how are you planning

52:22.670 --> 52:25.389
on wearing your hair
for the wedding?

52:25.440 --> 52:27.738
Don't worry about it.
I'll go figure it out.

52:29.810 --> 52:31.573
[beeping]

52:41.150 --> 52:42.617
Bye.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.492
That was the state police.
Still no leads on Mary.

53:00.540 --> 53:02.064
How could that happen?

53:02.110 --> 53:04.101
Look, somebody
had to have helped her.

53:04.140 --> 53:06.904
Well, my mom hired extra
security for today, so I don't

53:06.950 --> 53:09.339
think that we should be telling
Aria until after the wedding.

53:09.380 --> 53:12.144
Yeah. I agree.

53:12.180 --> 53:15.786
— Well..
— Hashtag Aria's wedding dress.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.855
Em, are you crying?

53:19.890 --> 53:21.357
Yeah.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.192
— You look so beautiful.
— Thank you.

53:27.770 --> 53:29.988
Oh, my God,
are you crying too?

53:30.040 --> 53:32.395
[laughs]
I'm just..

53:32.440 --> 53:35.432
I'm so happy to be here
with all of you.

53:35.470 --> 53:37.131
Celebrating you, Aria.

53:37.180 --> 53:39.933
Well, I couldn't have imagined
this day without you guys.

53:43.850 --> 53:46.148
Let's take a selfie before
the photographer gets here.

53:46.180 --> 53:47.647
- Yeah.
- Okay.

53:50.290 --> 53:52.349
[baby crying]
Oh, sorry, girls.

53:52.390 --> 53:54.483
She's a little muzzy,
so I thought

53:54.530 --> 53:56.680
I'd bring her in to see mommies.

53:56.730 --> 53:58.789
— May I?
— 'Yeah, of course.‘

53:59.830 --> 54:01.866
Oh, hi.

54:07.610 --> 54:09.362
Aria, you look so beautiful.

54:09.410 --> 54:12.174
You look like you you stepped
out of "Modern Bride."

54:12.210 --> 54:13.973
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Fields.

54:14.010 --> 54:17.104
I think after all these years,
you can call me Pam.

54:17.150 --> 54:19.971
Okay, Pam.

54:20.020 --> 54:22.318
Hey, gorgeous.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.508
You have your daddy's eyes.

54:27.790 --> 54:32.159
Yeah, I knew Wren
would make pretty babies.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.656
Yes.

54:36.870 --> 54:38.462
Hello, Spencer.

54:39.710 --> 54:40.893
So you're part of this too?

54:40.940 --> 54:42.703
No, I'm trapped in here
just like you.

54:42.740 --> 54:44.879
Yeah, well, you don't look
so trapped to me.

54:44.910 --> 54:47.128
I'm a wanted convict

54:47.180 --> 54:48.602
for Archie Dunhill's murder.

54:48.650 --> 54:50.675
A crime I didn't commit,
remember?

54:50.720 --> 54:52.347
'I took the blame
for you and your friends'

54:52.380 --> 54:55.019
so I think I deserve
a little trust.

54:58.860 --> 55:01.283
Ithought
we could have lunch together.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.856
[sighs]

55:36.330 --> 55:39.629
I took a lover in Peru
who owned a little restaurant

55:39.660 --> 55:43.221
that made the most exquisite
sa/tao'o o’e poi/o.

55:43.270 --> 55:45.830
'I'm the only person he ever
shared the recipe with.‘

55:45.870 --> 55:47.337
'Hm.'

56:13.870 --> 56:15.724
So where are we?

56:21.070 --> 56:23.231
I don't know.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.599
She gave me something to sleep

56:24.640 --> 56:26.676
and the next thing I knew,
I woke up here.

56:26.710 --> 56:29.508
But you're safe, Spencer.
She promised me.

56:31.450 --> 56:34.942
And in time,
you'll earn her trust

56:34.990 --> 56:37.550
and she'll let you
out of your room.

56:37.590 --> 56:39.057
Why didn't you ever tell me
about her?

56:39.090 --> 56:41.183
Until a few weeks ago
when she came to visit me

56:41.230 --> 56:43.687
I didn't know where she was
or if she was even alive.

56:43.730 --> 56:45.357
[thunder rumbling]

56:45.400 --> 56:47.618
[baby crying]

57:00.750 --> 57:02.968
(male #1)
'Nurse, hurry. Coming now.'

57:03.010 --> 57:04.671
(Ma/y) ,
What your parents o’lo'n ’t know

57:04.720 --> 57:06.745
was that
there was a second ch/io’.

57:08.520 --> 57:12.115
Dr. Cochran arranged
for Alex's adoption

57:12.160 --> 57:14.924
in exchange
for half of the money.

57:14.960 --> 57:16.120
You sold her?

57:16.160 --> 57:18.253
The money bought me
a ticket out of Radley.

57:18.300 --> 57:21.053
And Alex went
to a wealthy couple in England.

57:21.100 --> 57:24.399
I thought she would live
a Cinderella life.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.829
Have you read
"Grimm's Fairy Tales?"

57:28.810 --> 57:31.005
The irony hasn't been
wasted on me.

57:32.410 --> 57:34.571
Apparently,
Alex had some issues.

57:36.180 --> 57:38.774
And when she was still
young enough to forget them

57:38.820 --> 57:41.038
her parents left her
at an orphanage.

57:43.790 --> 57:45.382
They couldn't risk
tarnishing their names

57:45.420 --> 57:48.480
so they,
they even took that back

57:48.530 --> 57:50.680
and she was given
her birth name.

57:52.330 --> 57:53.729
Alex Drake.

57:53.770 --> 57:55.658
She ran away
from the Ambrose Home

57:55.700 --> 57:58.237
for wayward children
on her tenth birthday.

57:59.700 --> 58:01.839
A year before
I found out she was there.

58:04.310 --> 58:06.904
Can you imagine
how alone she must have felt?

58:10.020 --> 58:11.510
Yeah, I can.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.685
There is nothing more

58:15.720 --> 58:18.018
that I would love
than to hold you, Spencer

58:18.060 --> 58:20.483
but she would never forgive me
if you got out.

58:20.530 --> 58:22.589
[sobbing]

58:40.750 --> 58:44.140
— Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

58:44.180 --> 58:45.977
I'm your mother.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.661
[coughs]

59:04.040 --> 59:06.600
[sobbing]

59:22.390 --> 59:24.915
[dramatic music]

59:28.830 --> 59:31.253
Aria, this isn't about you.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.927
Yes, it is, dad.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.690
We got into an argument
last night. I let him down.

59:35.730 --> 59:38.858
No. He let you down.

59:38.900 --> 59:40.765
And after we make sure
that he's okay

59:40.810 --> 59:43.028
I'm going to wring his neck.

59:44.740 --> 59:46.970
— Should we tell the guests?
— No.

59:49.250 --> 59:50.706
Yes, I don't..

59:50.750 --> 59:52.877
I don't know. Should we?

59:54.420 --> 59:56.217
I'll take care of it.

59:58.360 --> 1:00:01.011
Aria, you should probably
try calling him again.

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:08.799
Ezra, I know that you're there.
Please pick up.

1:00:08.830 --> 1:00:11.264
What is going on?
Why isn't Ezra here?

1:00:11.300 --> 1:00:14.497
— Ezra sent Aria a text.
- He's not coming.

1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:17.065
[dramatic music]

1:00:20.650 --> 1:00:22.800
[grunts]

1:00:24.220 --> 1:00:25.949
Hey.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.744
Hey, can you hear me?

1:00:28.790 --> 1:00:30.610
Are you okay?

1:00:32.090 --> 1:00:33.352
Ezra?

1:00:38.300 --> 1:00:41.053
I was making the reservation
you suggested

1:00:41.100 --> 1:00:43.819
and when I thanked her
for the information

1:00:43.870 --> 1:00:45.462
she seemed confused.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:47.695
'Like she didn't know
what I was talking about.‘

1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:49.264
'So out of concern,
I followed around'

1:00:49.310 --> 1:00:53.235
and when I pressed her
for answers, she just turned

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:55.805
and just gave me
this death stare.

1:00:55.850 --> 1:00:59.115
And that was the last thing
that I remember.

1:00:59.150 --> 1:01:01.471
— Are you okay?
— It's my wedding day, Spencer.

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.387
And we're locked in some sort
of do-it-yourself dungeon

1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:05.887
so no, I'm, I'm not okay.

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:07.217
I meant your head.

1:01:08.590 --> 1:01:12.356
Sorry, sarcasm is my brain's
self-defense mechanism

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.960
for whenever
I'm about to be murdered.

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:21.759
[instrumental music]

1:01:30.950 --> 1:01:32.269
(Alison)
That was Spencer.

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:33.548
She's gonna swing
by the apartment

1:01:33.590 --> 1:01:35.444
and get you something to wear.

1:01:35.490 --> 1:01:38.186
My mom's sleeping over, so
we're gonna stay with you, okay?

1:01:39.590 --> 1:01:41.410
Aria.

1:01:41.460 --> 1:01:42.757
[knock on door]

1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:48.467
Ezra.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:49.797
Still no word?

1:01:49.830 --> 1:01:52.367
[music continues]

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:06.142
[door opens]

1:02:15.860 --> 1:02:17.851
Hello, sister.

1:02:24.340 --> 1:02:26.092
Hey.

1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:28.199
Hey, you don't have to do this.

1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:30.868
Can_ we have some
privacy, please?

1:02:30.910 --> 1:02:32.730
Wait, wait, no, no.
Stop. Stop.

1:02:33.980 --> 1:02:37.472
Look, we both understand
why you became A.D.

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:39.875
You and I actually met once.

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:43.139
Ezra? I don't think
you've met Wren Kingston.

1:02:43.190 --> 1:02:44.418
Wren was almost
my brother-in-law

1:02:44.460 --> 1:02:45.518
a couple of times.

1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.289
Have a drink with us.

1:02:47.330 --> 1:02:49.457
[beeping]

1:02:49.490 --> 1:02:51.685
Uh, no, stop, stop!

1:02:51.730 --> 1:02:52.890
(Spencer)
'Look, he's right.

1:02:52.930 --> 1:02:54.295
'You don't have to do this.‘

1:02:54.330 --> 1:02:57.424
Look, you became A.D.
because of Charlotte.

1:02:57.470 --> 1:02:59.768
I understand that
and my friends will too.

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:03.031
Okay, they'll forgive you
just like we forgave Mona.

1:03:03.070 --> 1:03:06.107
[chuckles]
So what?

1:03:06.140 --> 1:03:09.041
This isn't just about you
wanting my friends.

1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:10.399
It's about Toby, isn't it?

1:03:10.450 --> 1:03:12.714
He settled for Yvonne.

1:03:12.750 --> 1:03:14.149
We both know that.

1:03:14.190 --> 1:03:18.115
And now he's free to be
with his one true love.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:19.787
Me.

1:03:19.820 --> 1:03:21.879
So then what's gonna happen now?

1:03:21.930 --> 1:03:23.522
You can't just
keep me here forever.

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.027
Of course, I can.

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:26.948
And you have Mary
to thank for that.

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.490
She saved you
at the blind school

1:03:28.530 --> 1:03:29.690
and she's saving you now.

1:03:29.730 --> 1:03:31.288
_ So that wasn't
just Jenna and Noel.

1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:33.797
— That was you and Sydney.
— Sydney?

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.729
[laughs]
No, she was a one-off.

1:03:36.770 --> 1:03:38.169
Oh, she was stealing
from a bank.

1:03:38.210 --> 1:03:39.507
I knew it
and she fit the hoodie.

1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:42.839
ButJenna,
now she earned more respect.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:46.213
See, Jenna recruited Noel
to look for me

1:03:46.250 --> 1:03:47.717
'cause she knew
that Charlotte had a sister

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:50.810
and the Carissimi Group
was just the tip of the iceberg.

1:03:50.860 --> 1:03:53.556
See, Charlotte
left me everything.

1:03:53.590 --> 1:03:55.285
So Jenna wanted money?

1:03:55.330 --> 1:03:59.050
Well, she was desperate
for one last chance to stay.

1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:01.193
She doesn't know who I am,
but she offered to help me

1:04:01.230 --> 1:04:03.391
and I kept my promise.

1:04:03.430 --> 1:04:04.658
I paid for her surgery.

1:04:04.700 --> 1:04:07.965
She's still as blind as a bat
and useless to me.

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:10.729
What about Sara Harvey?
Was she looking for you too?

1:04:10.780 --> 1:04:13.476
Well, Charlotte told Sara

1:04:13.510 --> 1:04:16.240
that she hid her greatest
treasure in The Radley

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:18.441
and Sara thought that she was
talkin' about some pot of gold.

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:21.449
But what she meant
was that fail you found.

1:04:21.490 --> 1:04:24.050
You see, all Charlotte
ever wanted was a family.

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:28.923
That was, by far, the fastest
transatlantic flight

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.325
I've ever taken.

1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:32.499
And you are the most
charming woman

1:04:32.530 --> 1:04:33.929
I have ever been charmed by.

1:04:33.970 --> 1:04:36.222
Oh, Archer, I'm sure you say
that to all the girls.

1:04:36.270 --> 1:04:39.592
[chuckles]
No, I do not.

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:43.406
Charlotte Drake,
I will be calling you.

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:46.568
And I'm not going
to wait three days.

1:04:46.610 --> 1:04:48.168
I'll ring you tomorrow.

1:04:48.210 --> 1:04:51.702
Enchante, mao’emoise/ie.

1:04:51.750 --> 1:04:53.308
Au re voir.

1:04:55.890 --> 1:04:57.881
[cell phone rings]

1:04:59.790 --> 1:05:01.985
— Is she here?
— Yeah, her plane just landed.

1:05:02.030 --> 1:05:03.383
She's waiting
for you in the bar.

1:05:03.430 --> 1:05:05.057
And how do you know
that she's my sister?

1:05:05.100 --> 1:05:06.954
Her name's Alex Drake,
just like the birth certificate

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.490
you found
in your mom's Radley file.

1:05:08.530 --> 1:05:10.088
I found 12 Alex Drakes

1:05:10.130 --> 1:05:11.597
and I'm not related
to any of them.

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:14.359
Yeah, wait till you see her.

1:05:14.410 --> 1:05:15.900
(Charlotte)
'Do we really look
that much alike?‘

1:05:15.940 --> 1:05:17.669
(Wren)
'She looks a lot like someone'

1:05:17.710 --> 1:05:19.234
just not you.

1:05:22.510 --> 1:05:24.478
Charlotte.

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.715
Oh, my God.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:28.047
(Wren)
'It's crazy, right?‘

1:05:28.090 --> 1:05:30.217
— 'They're identical--'
— Twins.

1:05:31.890 --> 1:05:35.326
Once we started talking,
we couldn't stop.

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:38.329
We walked the streets of Paris
until the sun came up.

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:41.158
It felt like we'd known
each other for our whole lives.

1:05:43.330 --> 1:05:45.218
Charlotte met Archer
on that plane

1:05:45.270 --> 1:05:47.090
and those two started
one of the greatest love affairs

1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:48.835
I've ever seen.

1:05:48.870 --> 1:05:49.962
He adored her.

1:05:50.010 --> 1:05:51.637
So he was on the A team too?

1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:53.898
No, that stunt
that he pulled with Alison?

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.201
No, that was all him.

1:05:55.250 --> 1:05:56.899
He found Mary and convinced her

1:05:56.950 --> 1:05:58.747
it was what Charlotte
would have wanted

1:05:58.780 --> 1:06:00.247
and it probably was.

1:06:02.020 --> 1:06:04.284
She loved him.

1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:06.959
Before she came back
to Rosewood, the four of us

1:06:06.990 --> 1:06:08.719
Charlotte and Archer,
Wren and me

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.387
we did everything together.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:14.392
But Charlotte missed the game.

1:06:16.230 --> 1:06:17.993
Why are you giving them
so much power over you?

1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:20.497
I am the power.
Don't you get it?

1:06:20.540 --> 1:06:22.303
No. I don't.

1:06:22.340 --> 1:06:24.934
I won't be gone for long,
I promise.

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:26.629
Then let me come with you.

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:28.409
Please, come on.
I wanna meet her.

1:06:28.450 --> 1:06:33.274
No. You are to stay as far away
from the Hastings as possible.

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:36.244
They're terrible people.

1:06:36.290 --> 1:06:38.986
Are you sure you're not
just keeping her for yourself?

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:41.682
Don't be jealous.
She's just a doll to me.

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:47.155
I have to go.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:49.020
No, I'll drive you.

1:06:50.570 --> 1:06:52.629
It'll be too hard
to say goodbye to you.

1:06:57.710 --> 1:06:59.177
I almost forgot.

1:07:03.210 --> 1:07:04.609
It's my favorite.

1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:07.612
I love you, Alex.

1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:10.888
I'll always take care of you.

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:13.059
[instrumental music]

1:07:42.550 --> 1:07:44.689
She never came back to London.

1:07:46.690 --> 1:07:49.523
And the next time I saw her,
I was visiting her grave.

1:07:51.930 --> 1:07:56.264
Alex, why do you think
she never wanted us to meet?

1:07:59.070 --> 1:08:01.868
Well, I was thrown away
like trash

1:08:01.910 --> 1:08:04.401
and Charlotte saved me.

1:08:10.210 --> 1:08:12.610
Story time's over.

1:08:12.650 --> 1:08:13.776
Wait. Wait.

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:15.481
'So I'm still alive
because I'm your Sister'

1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:17.909
but what's gonna happen to Ezra?

1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:20.758
Well, he's not family, so..

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:27.425
Enjoy his company while you can.

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:41.579
[instrumental music]

1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:08.633
[whispers]
I think that you and I are
gonna be the closest of all.

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:19.918
Hey, there.

1:09:24.490 --> 1:09:25.559
Hey.

1:09:27.230 --> 1:09:28.925
You know me, right?

1:09:29.990 --> 1:09:31.287
'Yeah.‘

1:09:31.330 --> 1:09:33.298
'Yeah, of course, you do.‘

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:38.692
Good boy.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.267
Good boy.

1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:45.207
You're okay.

1:09:46.010 --> 1:09:47.637
You're okay.

1:09:50.210 --> 1:09:51.199
Come on.

1:09:51.250 --> 1:09:52.877
[neighs]

1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:57.181
Whoa. Easy. Are you okay?

1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:00.053
Yeah. Yeah, um, it's fine.

1:10:00.090 --> 1:10:01.978
He's just, he's just having
a bit of a bad day.

1:10:02.030 --> 1:10:03.520
The best thing to do
when he gets like this

1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:05.949
is just to walk away.

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.319
Easy.

1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:15.361
I was wondering
if you've seen Ezra.

1:10:15.410 --> 1:10:17.002
Uh, we haven't been able
to get a hold of him.

1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.634
I'm not really sure what we're
supposed to be looking for.

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:23.002
And it doesn't makes sense.
Ezra leaving Aria at the altar.

1:10:23.050 --> 1:10:26.110
Yeah, or why he would leave town
without his packed bag?

1:10:26.150 --> 1:10:27.469
[knock on door]

1:10:31.220 --> 1:10:32.585
Mrs. Fitz!

1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:35.088
— No, I-I'm not Mrs. Fitz.
— Who are you?

1:10:35.130 --> 1:10:38.452
Davis David of Davis David
Hot Air Balloon Rides.

1:10:39.730 --> 1:10:43.598
- Are you Mrs. Fitz?
- Uh, no.

1:10:43.630 --> 1:10:45.837
Well, uh,
Ezra's booked us yesterday

1:10:45.870 --> 1:10:49.169
to take him and his wife up
to kick off their honeymoon.

1:10:49.210 --> 1:10:50.461
When yesterday?

1:10:50.510 --> 1:10:52.876
Oh, uh, morning
around, uh, 10 o'clock

1:10:52.910 --> 1:10:55.344
uh, through
The Radley concierge.

1:10:56.610 --> 1:10:59.170
Why would Ezra book you
on a hot air balloon ride

1:10:59.220 --> 1:11:01.415
if he wasn't planning
on marrying you?

1:11:08.390 --> 1:11:10.756
(Jenna)
'Do you think it'll help because
she needs to be stopped?‘

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:12.950
Oh, if nothing else,
just the threat of a civil case

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.729
could be enough
to force her parents to accept

1:11:14.770 --> 1:11:17.489
some responsibility
for Addison's actions.

1:11:17.540 --> 1:11:19.599
Thank you, Veronica.

1:11:21.510 --> 1:11:24.638
— Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:27.638
Yeah, you're just a rock star,
that's all.

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:31.047
Well, you've never called me
that before, but I'll take it.

1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:32.547
— Bye.
— Bye.

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:35.939
Thank you for setting
this up, Spencer.

1:11:35.990 --> 1:11:37.742
Yeah, I hope we can help.

1:11:39.690 --> 1:11:42.557
Is that a new perfume
you're wearing?

1:11:44.430 --> 1:11:46.318
Oh, it's called horse hair.

1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:49.693
I was at the stables
this morning With Toby.

1:11:49.730 --> 1:11:52.119
Well, maybe you can convince him
to stay for a while.

1:11:52.170 --> 1:11:54.730
Yeah, I think I'd like to try.

1:11:54.770 --> 1:11:57.034
— Thanks again.
— Of course.

1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:07.109
[cell phone beeps]

1:12:07.150 --> 1:12:08.617
Call Toby.

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.054
Hi. Toby, um,
I know this may sound weird..

1:12:19.130 --> 1:12:21.553
...but I don't think
Spencer's Spencer.

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.264
I hacked into all
of his credit card accounts.

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:28.962
Ezra hasn't spent a dime
since he sent the text to Aria.

1:12:29.010 --> 1:12:31.035
'He didn't buy gas,
he didn't rent a room'

1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:32.308
or buy a plane ticket.

1:12:32.340 --> 1:12:34.035
So you think
he's still in Rosewood?

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:38.449
I just accessed his LoJack
and his car is..

1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:42.710
...parked at The Radley.

1:12:42.750 --> 1:12:44.615
I'm gonna send an SOS
to Spencer.

1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.355
(Toby)
I wouldn't do that.

1:12:46.390 --> 1:12:49.518
— Why? What's wrong?
— What is that?

1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:50.822
Spencer gave me this the day

1:12:50.860 --> 1:12:52.794
Yvonne and I were supposed
to leave town.

1:12:52.830 --> 1:12:54.627
And then she asked me
for a goodbye kiss

1:12:54.670 --> 1:12:56.365
which I felt it was an odd thing
for Spencer to do.

1:12:56.400 --> 1:12:58.925
Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what
does this have to do with Ezra?

1:12:58.970 --> 1:13:01.564
I didn't look at the book
until today.

1:13:01.610 --> 1:13:03.601
It's not hers.
It's not Spencer's.

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:05.062
I'm confused.

1:13:05.110 --> 1:13:08.500
She was always writing down
notes in that book.

1:13:08.550 --> 1:13:10.506
There's not one single note
in there.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:14.371
Okay, now I'm really confused.

1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:16.638
Well, what if twins
run in the family?

1:13:20.460 --> 1:13:22.485
If Spencer had a twin..

1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:25.948
...that would make her
Charlotte's half sister.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.163
And someone with
the motivation to be A.D.

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:31.566
Okay, are we really saying
that AD. is back?

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.568
Yeah, that
she's Spencer's evil twin?

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:35.158
That who's doing this to us?

1:13:35.210 --> 1:13:37.838
I mean, out of all the insane
theories we've jumped to

1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:40.769
Spencer having an evil twin
has got to be the most insane.

1:13:40.810 --> 1:13:43.404
— 'No, it's not.'
— 'My head is gonna explode.‘

1:13:50.820 --> 1:13:52.287
It's time for plan B.

1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:55.721
You need to tell me
who you are and where you are?

1:14:00.330 --> 1:14:03.219
— 'I won't let you do this.‘
- 'Shut up, mom.‘

1:14:03.270 --> 1:14:05.363
— 'I'm begging you, please.‘
— 'Come on, Spencer.‘

1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:07.163
Ezra, I have done this before.

1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:08.838
— I've got this.
- Okay.

1:14:08.870 --> 1:14:11.464
Alex, you promised me
that you wouldn't hurt her.

1:14:11.510 --> 1:14:12.909
No, I have to dispose off
the proof.

1:14:12.940 --> 1:14:15.579
And I'm not gonna hurt her.
It'll be painless.

1:14:15.610 --> 1:14:17.771
We can leave now
and still get away.

1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:19.845
'Let's take a mother-daughter
trip to Europe.‘

1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.677
No!

1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.984
I'm not going anywhere
without Toby.

1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:25.851
Right, I see it in his eyes
he's in love with me.

1:14:25.890 --> 1:14:27.517
He's in love with Spencer,
not you.

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.755
Well, I am Spencer now!

1:14:31.130 --> 1:14:32.154
Listen to me.

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:36.589
I know what it's like
to want something so badly

1:14:36.630 --> 1:14:39.167
that you start to believe
that it's true.

1:14:41.370 --> 1:14:42.962
Do you understand?

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:46.208
No. I'm sorry.

1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:57.015
Wren came to Welby to kill me

1:14:57.050 --> 1:14:59.712
but I convinced him I could help
get Mary out of prison.

1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:01.716
So you lied to me?

1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.785
You're still playing
the game with her.

1:15:03.830 --> 1:15:05.855
No, Hanna.
I'm playing to beat her.

1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:09.097
— And now I know where she is.
— Where is that?

1:15:09.130 --> 1:15:12.293
North 39.57 52

1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:14.968
West 71.28 57.

1:15:16.870 --> 1:15:19.771
That's here in Rosewood.
492 Hart Street.

1:15:19.810 --> 1:15:22.643
Wait, Toby, isn't that
your house, the one you built?

1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:24.568
I never found out who bought it.

1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:26.372
I guess now we know.

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:28.069
So let's go.

1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:33.057
[dramatic music]

1:15:36.530 --> 1:15:37.656
Which way?

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:40.225
Uh, uh, Spencer,
over here! Over here.

1:15:41.230 --> 1:15:42.697
[door opens]

1:15:42.730 --> 1:15:44.220
'Spencer, now!‘

1:15:44.270 --> 1:15:46.795
[music continues]

1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.214
Oh, my God. She really
was gonna keep me here forever.

1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:08.308
This, this gotta be the way out.

1:16:14.630 --> 1:16:16.268
[gaSPS]

1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:17.927
Hello?

1:16:17.970 --> 1:16:20.029
_ — Hello?
— Wait, wait. Stop, stop!

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.578
We're still underground.

1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:37.611
Oh, my God.

1:16:39.860 --> 1:16:41.919
There's no way out, Spencer

1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.019
and there's nowhere to hide.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:54.392
— That's weird.
— What?

1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:57.136
Isn't that Spencer's
coffee table and her couch?

1:16:57.170 --> 1:17:00.071
This stuff is all brand-new.
There's still tags on them.

1:17:04.150 --> 1:17:05.708
Over here.

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:12.859
[crow cawing]

1:17:12.890 --> 1:17:14.209
It's all fake.

1:17:14.260 --> 1:17:16.353
No, there's gotta be
a way out of here.

1:17:18.630 --> 1:17:20.188
What is this place?

1:17:20.230 --> 1:17:22.323
I don't know,
but we're about to find out.

1:17:31.140 --> 1:17:32.164
Anything?

1:17:32.210 --> 1:17:34.030
The only way out
is back through there.

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:36.298
No, no way I'm doin' that.

1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:01.336
I'm sorry that you got
the wrong end of the deal.

1:18:01.370 --> 1:18:04.009
I'm sorry you got
the wrong end of the deal.

1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:06.577
It's not too late
to be a family.

1:18:06.610 --> 1:18:08.498
Yeah, it is.

1:18:08.550 --> 1:18:10.677

Toby, it's me. Spencer.

1:18:37.570 --> 1:18:40.368
Don't listen to her!

1:18:40.410 --> 1:18:42.469
Look at me, you know me.

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:47.014
You guys, come on, seriously.

You really do believe
what you're saying.

1:19:46.580 --> 1:19:51.199
Well, no one can call you
loser Mona anymore.

1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:55.044

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:01.852
[bell tolling]

1:20:10.170 --> 1:20:16.905
This relationship stands
for love, loyalty and trust

1:21:37.050 --> 1:21:39.780
I now pronounce you

'You may kiss the bride.‘

1:21:44.090 --> 1:21:46.081
I present you
for the very first time

[applauding]

1:22:02.310 --> 1:22:04.778
I was looking online
and your first class seats

1:22:04.820 --> 1:22:06.310
are bigger than our bedroom.

1:22:06.350 --> 1:22:07.840
Oh, and you have
to get the duck.

1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:09.416
If they're flying it in
from Peking, it has to be--

1:22:09.450 --> 1:22:11.281
Han, that's how
the duck is prepared.

1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:12.719
It's not actually from Peking.

1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:14.455
Okay, you don't know that
for sure, Spencer.

1:22:14.490 --> 1:22:17.220
Yes, I do
because Peking is now Beijing.

1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:19.057
Well, then they should
call it Beijing duck.

1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:21.398
I'm gonna get the duck, Han.

1:22:21.430 --> 1:22:23.364
We heard Toby's sticking around.

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:25.994
Oh, yeah, um,
Jason said that he's got

1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:27.291
that veteran's program
in Philly.

1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:29.262
Yeah, if it works out,
they should, um

1:22:29.310 --> 1:22:30.834
get a lot of homeless people
off the streets.

1:22:30.870 --> 1:22:35.034
Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep
climbing into your sheets.

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.445
Sorry, are you already
honeymoon drunk?

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:40.576
— No! I'm, I'm happy for you.
— We all are.

1:22:40.620 --> 1:22:43.384
[sighs]
I've always loved
you two together.

1:22:44.650 --> 1:22:46.015
Is it actually possible

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:47.618
that all of us are happy
at the same time?

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:49.480
Oh, my God, don't say that
out loud, it's a jinx.

1:22:49.530 --> 1:22:52.784
Oh, well, then I guess
I can't say this other thing.

1:22:52.830 --> 1:22:54.058
Uh, yes, you can.

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:56.421
No, I promised Caleb
I wouldn't say anything.

1:22:56.470 --> 1:22:57.664
Okay, just because
you're married

1:22:57.700 --> 1:22:59.668
doesn't mean
you can have secrets.

1:22:59.700 --> 1:23:02.794
Alright, well,
it's a little early

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:06.037
but I'm pregnant.

1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:08.002
- Oh.
- Oh.

1:23:08.050 --> 1:23:09.176
Congratulations.

1:23:09.210 --> 1:23:10.370
You're okay with that, right?

1:23:10.410 --> 1:23:13.675
Hanna, of course.
That's amazing.

1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:16.177
Besides, we're right behind you.

1:23:16.220 --> 1:23:17.380
When we get back from our trip

1:23:17.420 --> 1:23:20.253
we're gonna meet
with an adoption agency.

1:23:20.290 --> 1:23:23.259

- No, I won't.

It's Ezra. The car is here.

1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:30.466
Well, you're gonna send us
a ton of photos, right?

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:32.024
Oh, and don't forget to take
pictures of all of your

1:23:32.070 --> 1:23:34.868
hotel rooms before you
mess it up with all your stuff.

1:23:34.910 --> 1:23:37.105
There's this new group chat app
that we should all be on.

1:23:37.140 --> 1:23:38.937
I'll text it to you.

1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:40.129
Guys, I'm leaving
for three weeks.

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:42.501
Why is everybody crying?

1:23:42.550 --> 1:23:44.700
I don't know.

1:23:44.750 --> 1:23:47.344
For some reason, this feels
like it's the end of something.

She's gone.

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:47.914
I've looked everywhere for her.
