00:01.800 --> 00:04.282
Hi, I'm Brad Chase from D.C. —Hi.

00:04.282 --> 00:05.220
I think that's my seat.

00:05.220 --> 00:08.153
I'm sorry. We're not territorial about
that sort of thing around here, are we?

00:08.153 --> 00:09.592
–I was handling it.
–I just thought I'd help out.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.399
That's very nice, but again,
I was handling it.

00:11.399 --> 00:13.212
So why does it bother you
that I'm trying to help?

00:13.212 --> 00:14.718
Wait a minute.

00:14.718 --> 00:16.001
You two have had sex.

00:16.001 --> 00:17.184
We can't tail the wife.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.683
Ernie Dell is one of our biggest clients.

00:19.683 --> 00:22.274
If he wants a private investigator,
what's the real harm?

00:22.274 --> 00:23.815
I'm the one sleeping with his wife.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.185
–I'm sorry?
–Sure.

00:25.185 --> 00:28.685
He makes fun of me. –But I'm a big
fan of your aqua velva commercials.

00:28.685 --> 00:30.958
No, it's not right.
He calls me a Ken doll, while he…

00:30.958 --> 00:32.232
…plays with your Barbie?

00:32.232 --> 00:35.591
Completely mindful of the fact
that you helped build this place,

00:35.591 --> 00:39.401
the partners here will not allow you
to dismantle it with your buffoonery.

00:39.401 --> 00:41.357
They're not going to take 
the firm from you.

00:41.357 --> 00:43.590
I'm not worried, Lori.
Do I look worried?

00:43.590 --> 00:45.283
Look out there.

00:45.283 --> 00:46.681
My domain.

00:46.681 --> 00:48.203
My city.

00:48.203 --> 00:50.111
I'm Denny Crane.

01:20.842 --> 01:23.564
You have 30′.

01:30.002 --> 01:33.110
I have to say,
I find this very strange.

01:33.110 --> 01:38.373
I always thought I'd be the one 
visiting you in the mental hospital.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.868
I'm excited about tomorrow.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.641
Please tell me we have a shot.

01:44.641 --> 01:46.981
I don't know how much longer
I can take it in here.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.993
We have a shot.

01:49.444 --> 01:51.316
I'll get you out.

01:51.316 --> 01:53.945
I don't need to hear it, Alan.
I need it to happen.

01:53.945 --> 01:56.013
The board will question you directly.

01:56.013 --> 01:59.853
It's entirely possible
they'll try to provoke you.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.682
To make sure I'm bombproof?

02:01.682 --> 02:04.430
Sorry? —It's an expression 
with horses.

02:04.430 --> 02:06.912
To be safe to ride, a horse 
needs to be bombproof.

02:06.912 --> 02:08.095
It doesn't spook easily.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.684
Can't have one who just flies off.

02:11.684 --> 02:13.677
Yes, in addition to not flying off,

02:13.677 --> 02:15.109
you need to show contrition.

02:15.109 --> 02:19.856
They like to see that you're sorry.

02:19.856 --> 02:21.519
I am.

02:23.189 --> 02:26.866
I, I am so sorry,

02:26.866 --> 02:30.515
so deep, deeply ashamed.

02:30.515 --> 02:32.529
How do I say it right?

02:32.529 --> 02:34.529
Just like that.

02:36.931 --> 02:37.947
Christine,

02:37.947 --> 02:40.518
you were in love with 
a man who was unworthy of you,

02:40.518 --> 02:44.286
who made you doubt everything
that you had a right to count on,

02:44.286 --> 02:47.696
who perhaps even toyed with your sanity.

02:47.696 --> 02:51.187
Still no excuse for trying to kill him.

02:51.187 --> 02:54.192
Perhaps he had it coming.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.791
Perhaps you did.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2004/10/10

03:45.225 --> 03:47.299
Why is it we agreed
to bifurcate the trial?

03:47.299 --> 03:49.408
There's been no claim for punitive
damage, only compensatory,

03:49.408 --> 03:51.083
but our fear was a jury 
could be so outraged,

03:51.083 --> 03:53.924
they might artificially inflate 
compensatories as a de facto puni,

03:53.924 --> 03:55.169
so we opted to bifurcate.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.058
Separate juries, one for 
liability, one for damages.

03:57.058 --> 03:59.458
The client concurred.

04:00.057 --> 04:03.462
Do you do tongue push-ups?

04:03.780 --> 04:05.121
This is a staff meeting.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.798
I encourage all to conduct
themselves professionally,

04:06.798 --> 04:11.174
keeping in mind that remarks
are tantamount to assertive conduct.

04:11.174 --> 04:14.075
Lansing vs Mahoney…

04:14.075 --> 04:16.476
Hospital settled out, deposition 
of Dr Mahoney is today,

04:16.476 --> 04:18.093
we're hoping to make
some movement on that as well.

04:18.093 --> 04:18.971
Lot of eyes are on us.

04:18.971 --> 04:20.749
We've got an HMO on the bubble here

04:20.749 --> 04:22.668
waiting to see how this lawsuit is restored.

04:22.668 --> 04:25.187
I assume you've prepared
for today's deposition.

04:25.187 --> 04:28.155
Actually, Denny's taking it.

04:29.339 --> 04:33.138
Denny's taking the deposition?

04:33.138 --> 04:34.903
Yes.

04:35.866 --> 04:39.419
Wouldn't it be better
to save Denny for trial,

04:39.419 --> 04:42.543
–roll out the big gun later?
–Roll out the big gun now,

04:42.543 --> 04:45.097
this won't be a trial.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.097
Move along, Paul.

04:50.273 --> 04:53.156
In re Christine Pauley…

04:53.156 --> 04:54.574
Mine.

04:54.574 --> 04:56.424
Ex­girlfriend tried to kill me.

04:56.424 --> 04:58.288
This is the commitment proceeding?

04:58.288 --> 05:00.899
She was committed. This hearing
is to secure her release.

05:00.899 --> 05:02.993
Wait a second.
She tried to kill you.

05:02.993 --> 05:04.724
–She did.
–And now she wants out.

05:04.724 --> 05:07.106
She does. —And you're trying to
help her get out.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.163
I am.

05:29.726 --> 05:31.296
You're angry with me.

05:31.296 --> 05:33.524
I'm just busy, okay?

05:39.801 --> 05:42.244
I'm not gonna even discuss the absurdity

05:42.244 --> 05:44.737
of representing an ex­lover
who tried to kill you,

05:44.737 --> 05:47.186
but how do you not at least tell me?

05:47.186 --> 05:50.829
That isn't something
that I should know?

05:50.829 --> 05:53.267
I wanted to surprise you with it.

05:53.267 --> 05:54.659
Do you think it's funny?

05:54.659 --> 05:59.540
Do you think it's appropriate for me
to learn about it in a staff meeting?

05:59.540 --> 06:03.926
Forgive me. As you can imagine,
I haven't kept up with…

06:03.926 --> 06:09.123
the boyfriend/girlfriend regulations.

06:09.123 --> 06:16.485
What I can say is she's a client,
and a friend…

06:17.012 --> 06:21.755
that I'm trying to free from the 
clutches of an overreaching asylum.

06:21.755 --> 06:23.378
You keep calling it an asylum.

06:23.378 --> 06:25.641
This is a psychiatric hospital.

06:25.641 --> 06:29.343
I mean no disrespect, doctor, but
the word “hospital” implies treatment.

06:29.343 --> 06:30.591
And she has gotten treatment.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.926
–Is she less crazy?
–Excuse me?

06:32.926 --> 06:36.527
As a result of your treatment,
is she less crazy?

06:37.100 --> 06:41.150
Crazy is not a medically recognized
term, Mr Shore.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.798
As I've just explained,

06:42.798 --> 06:47.789
Christine has what the DSM refers to
as intermittent explosive disorder.

06:47.789 --> 06:52.249
Then please tell us,
is she less intermittently explosive?

06:52.249 --> 06:53.460
She has improved.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.746
And to what do you attribute that?

06:54.746 --> 06:56.948
Primarily the pharmacological 
regimen. —Pills.

06:56.948 --> 07:00.173
25 milligrams each of three
different anti-psychotics

07:00.173 --> 07:01.582
administered three times daily.

07:01.582 --> 07:03.189
Then maybe it's a good thing she's here.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.810
That sounds like a very complicated
protocol to administer on one's own.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.084
Indeed.

07:08.084 --> 07:10.665
How do you know she actually 
takes these pills?

07:10.665 --> 07:13.383
Obviously, we keep very careful records.

07:13.383 --> 07:15.399
I'm sure you do.

07:15.718 --> 07:17.663
But hypothetically,

07:17.663 --> 07:21.068
suppose there was a patient 
who felt she didn't belong here,

07:21.068 --> 07:25.036
felt that she'd entered
your hospital quite troubled,

07:25.036 --> 07:29.869
but essentially sane, and was being
driven insane by this institution.

07:29.869 --> 07:32.955
Maybe she's a 
New York university graduate,

07:32.955 --> 07:36.317
a respected attorney, a charming,

07:36.317 --> 07:40.925
intelligent, sensitive, funny woman.

07:40.925 --> 07:44.363
A fully functional person with 
the exception of one incident.

07:44.363 --> 07:47.779
So each and every time your
orderlies come around

07:47.779 --> 07:52.639
with your 75 milligrams of powerful
anti-psychotics for her to swallow,

07:52.639 --> 07:56.395
she hides the tablets under
her tongue and saves them.

07:56.395 --> 07:58.688
Day after day,

07:58.688 --> 08:03.800
a growing collection of thoroughly
unnecessary medication

08:03.800 --> 08:06.895
that her primary psychiatric caregiver

08:06.895 --> 08:08.810
wants to shove down her throat.

08:08.810 --> 08:12.879
Are you asking if this hypothetical
scenario could happen?

08:12.879 --> 08:13.847
I am.

08:13.847 --> 08:15.352
It could not.

08:15.352 --> 08:18.587
We keep very careful records.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.077
Look, I don't see why 
I need to be present.

08:48.077 --> 08:50.309
A part of her emotional 
distress claim goes

08:50.309 --> 08:52.249
to how you informed her 
of her husband's death.

08:52.249 --> 08:53.689
I've been a surgeon for 30 years.

08:53.689 --> 08:57.400
If there's a pleasant way
to tell a family a patient died…

08:58.420 --> 09:02.309
We're gonna need your response
to her account.

09:02.961 --> 09:05.019
We're in conference room one.
We'll be right in.

09:05.019 --> 09:06.131
Thank you.

09:06.131 --> 09:07.613
Don't look at him.

09:11.244 --> 09:14.235
Why can't I just review the transcript?
I really don't want to sit in that room.

09:14.235 --> 09:16.443
We don't need you to do 
or say anything.

09:16.443 --> 09:18.393
We just need you to sit there 
and listen.

09:18.393 --> 09:21.037
Brad, one second, please.

09:21.037 --> 09:23.125
Excuse me. —Yeah.

09:25.058 --> 09:27.787
You can't let him first-chair 
this deposition.

09:27.787 --> 09:29.424
Paul, he's insisting. —First of all,

09:29.424 --> 09:31.196
the case could
turn on this proceeding,

09:31.196 --> 09:33.100
and second, as I mentioned,

09:33.100 --> 09:36.305
we have several medical corporations,
potential clients,

09:36.305 --> 09:38.581
taking a keen interest… —Hey.

09:38.581 --> 09:40.159
Guys.

09:40.159 --> 09:41.664
What are we talking about?

09:41.664 --> 09:45.330
Looks interesting from afar.
Anything I might enjoy?

09:45.330 --> 09:48.228
What's this case about, Denny?

09:48.228 --> 09:53.290
The deposition you're about to 
conduct, what's it about again?

09:59.589 --> 10:05.096
A man died during angioplasty,
leaving him dead, tragic.

10:06.689 --> 10:12.558
He even described the procedure
as common, so for…

10:12.558 --> 10:14.922
One of your allegations goes to…

10:14.922 --> 10:18.660
how Dr Mahoney informed 
you of the tragic outcome.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.509
He just came out and said 
my husband had a cardiac arrest
and was dead.

10:23.509 --> 10:25.301
He just turned and walked away.

10:25.301 --> 10:27.486
But he said he was going
to talk to me later.

10:27.486 --> 10:28.834
Do you make room for the possibility

10:28.834 --> 10:33.933
that Dr Mahoney himself was 
devastated at this time?

10:33.933 --> 10:36.753
The patient was my husband.

10:36.753 --> 10:39.855
Whatever pain he had…

10:41.058 --> 10:45.415
These are difficult questions.

10:46.363 --> 10:48.733
You're, um…

10:49.267 --> 10:54.162
40 pounds lighter since before
your husband's death?

10:54.162 --> 10:55.134
Yes.

10:55.134 --> 10:56.559
Dating again? —Objection.

10:56.559 --> 10:57.408
This certainly has no relevance.

10:57.408 --> 11:00.103
All objections have been
waived till the trial,

11:00.103 --> 11:01.875
except for the form 
of the question, sport.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.348
–This your first deposition?
–This is not my first deposition.

11:04.348 --> 11:05.510
Well, then play by the rules.

11:05.510 --> 11:08.555
Don't make me move for costs,

11:08.555 --> 11:11.968
which she'll end up paying.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.709
In this last year, would you say

11:14.709 --> 11:18.901
you've had more or less sex
since the time of your husband's…

11:18.901 --> 11:22.822
Objection! —All right, this is a tough 
deposition for everybody.

11:22.822 --> 11:27.669
Let's just try to get through it.
Denny.

11:31.657 --> 11:37.171
More or less sex this past year?

11:37.171 --> 11:40.925
My physical relationship
with my husband had waned,

11:40.925 --> 11:43.586
partly because of his heart condition.

11:43.586 --> 11:45.569
We remained very much in love.

11:45.569 --> 11:48.466
And did you go on lots of trips 
together, you and your husband?

11:48.466 --> 11:50.055
Some.

11:50.055 --> 11:51.535
He was very busy with work.

11:51.535 --> 11:55.071
Did he regularly tell you 
how incredibly…

11:55.071 --> 11:57.561
incredibly beautiful you are?

11:57.561 --> 12:00.980
Did you wear this perfume
when your husband was alive?

12:00.980 --> 12:02.747
–I believe I did.
–That's magnificent.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.906
–All right. This deposition is over.
–Why?

12:04.906 --> 12:06.360
It's over.
Come on, Carrie.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.049
Off to court we go, Cub scout.

12:09.049 --> 12:11.330
Oh, we'll be going
into court, all right.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.275
We're done here.

12:23.083 --> 12:26.920
The fact that she was secretly
refusing to take her medication

12:26.920 --> 12:29.290
does not persuade us of progress.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.753
But it does show she's capable
of going six months

12:31.753 --> 12:33.340
unmedicated without incident.

12:33.340 --> 12:35.511
Mr Shore, you were her lover.

12:35.511 --> 12:38.772
Any bias I might have
in favor of Christine

12:38.772 --> 12:41.319
would be more than offset by the fact
that she tried to kill me.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.830
Frankly, we're insulted by that.
It might get you a spot on

12:43.830 --> 12:45.162
“Good morning America,” but…

12:45.162 --> 12:46.693
I'm trying to get her
a spot of freedom.

12:46.693 --> 12:49.421
Freedom is a privilege,
Mr Shore, not a right.

12:49.421 --> 12:51.346
–A privilege? 
–Yes, and it's revocable,

12:51.346 --> 12:54.658
especially if you try to run 
someone over with an automobile.

12:54.658 --> 12:56.956
Christine Pauley is well.

12:56.956 --> 13:01.299
You have an affidavit from 
three independent
psychiatrists who evaluated her.

13:01.299 --> 13:04.130
Likely made her sign waivers
as soon as you paid them.

13:04.130 --> 13:06.792
The only reason you're holding her

13:06.792 --> 13:09.526
is you're afraid of being sued
should she do something.

13:09.526 --> 13:13.141
We're afraid she'll hurt herself
or someone else, you cynical snot.

13:13.141 --> 13:15.833
Is liability to the hospital
a factor? Yes.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.865
We can't treat patients
out of bankruptcy.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.747
I hardly see how that 
makes me a snot.

13:21.747 --> 13:22.829
She's in here

13:22.829 --> 13:26.090
because of one isolated
incident she's not likely to repeat.

13:26.090 --> 13:29.689
Oh, you can gaze into 
some crystal ball…

13:29.689 --> 13:31.437
I can gaze into her.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.734
I saw the look in her eyes
the day she was brought here.

13:33.734 --> 13:36.423
I saw the look in her eyes
which led to her being brought here.

13:36.423 --> 13:38.106
She had that look then.

13:38.106 --> 13:41.658
She does not have it now.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.232
Who would be this woman's guardian?

13:46.232 --> 13:47.564
Why is no one here to present…

13:47.564 --> 13:49.666
Her parents would 
serve as guardians.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.843
–You'll find their affidavits.
–They live in Illinois.

13:51.843 --> 13:54.110
Where Christine would be 
going upon release.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.897
And until she gets to Illinois?

13:55.897 --> 13:59.510
Until then, I will be her guardian.

14:03.023 --> 14:05.111
Ms Pauley?

14:05.804 --> 14:08.989
Well, at the risk of 
also sounding biased,

14:08.989 --> 14:11.036
I agree with him.

14:11.036 --> 14:12.824
This is not a parole board.

14:12.824 --> 14:14.846
This is not a prison.

14:14.846 --> 14:18.782
As you say, Dr Gill,
this is a hospital,

14:18.782 --> 14:21.742
and when patients are healed,

14:21.742 --> 14:25.089
they're let out of hospitals.

14:43.235 --> 14:45.041
Coffee not good?

14:45.041 --> 14:48.603
Oh, no, it's, I was just 
thinking about something.

14:48.603 --> 14:50.442
Yeah, I do that.

14:51.754 --> 14:54.139
Thinking about what?

14:56.454 --> 14:59.304
That's kind of private.

15:01.154 --> 15:04.426
You know, I'd stake out a little 
distance from that Shore guy, Sally.

15:04.426 --> 15:07.489
He tends to leave people's minds
a little worse off than he finds them.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.182
His old girlfriend, case in point.

15:09.182 --> 15:10.703
You two discussing cases?

15:10.703 --> 15:15.158
I wasn't aware you provided emotional
counsel as well as legal, Lori.

15:15.158 --> 15:16.279
That's quite a perk.

15:16.279 --> 15:19.012
A woman tries to kill you,
you go to represent her.

15:19.012 --> 15:22.718
You don't think there's
a pathology at play here?

15:23.430 --> 15:26.252
–I referred to yours.
–I got the reference, thank you.

15:26.252 --> 15:29.007
Speaking as an enormously
unlikable person,

15:29.007 --> 15:35.517
I find it difficult to maintain 
grudges against all those 
who want to kill me, don't you?

15:41.141 --> 15:46.255
Yes, you'll perhaps find that 
witty comeback in your office.

15:59.557 --> 16:02.803
He's got a motion for costs,
for sanctions,

16:02.803 --> 16:06.034
he has ordered a transcript
so he can read back to the judge
what you said today.

16:06.034 --> 16:08.199
Good. Then I won't have to
bother trying to remember.

16:08.199 --> 16:09.720
Damn it, Denny, you're 
way out of the line.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.271
This woman has just lost a husband.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.897
You're asking her questions
about her sex life, her perfume?

16:13.897 --> 16:16.591
–I know what I'm doing.
–Which is?

16:16.591 --> 16:17.727
It'll come to me.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.495
That lawyer is going to pick you 
apart in open court tomorrow.

16:20.495 --> 16:22.666
Let him try. 
Denny Crane.

16:22.666 --> 16:23.937
Listen to me.

16:23.937 --> 16:26.110
Do you know why I was brought here?

16:26.110 --> 16:31.491
The firm thinks that you are
becoming a liability.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.034
They wanted me to control you.

16:35.034 --> 16:37.434
Who thinks I'm a liability?

16:37.434 --> 16:39.721
It doesn't matter.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.990
Who?

16:44.506 --> 16:46.056
Denny,

16:46.056 --> 16:49.103
you were once something to aspire to.

16:49.103 --> 16:51.703
You're now becoming
something to parody.

16:51.703 --> 16:53.414
You walk around saying

16:53.414 --> 16:56.852
“Denny Crane, Denny crane”
like it's supposed to

16:56.852 --> 17:02.554
intimidate or conjure up awe.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.839
You're a complete joke.

17:06.036 --> 17:10.647
If that gets me fired, so be it.
I'm saying it just the same.

17:10.647 --> 17:12.905
You know why?

17:14.119 --> 17:16.488
Because I love you.

17:16.807 --> 17:19.095
I adore you.

17:21.819 --> 17:25.614
But it hurts to see you 
deteriorating into a…

17:25.614 --> 17:29.007
Get the hell out of my office.

17:42.763 --> 17:44.558
You didn't have to 
get me a hotel room.

17:44.558 --> 17:46.319
I didn't. You're staying in my place.

17:46.319 --> 17:49.067
–I beg your pardon?
–I won't get fresh.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.162
You live in a hotel? —I do.

17:51.162 --> 17:53.083
What happened to your big, 
grotesque house

17:53.083 --> 17:54.789
with your more grotesque 
swimming pool

17:54.789 --> 17:57.156
and your even more 
grotesque rumpus room?

17:57.156 --> 17:58.795
I sold it.

17:58.795 --> 18:01.910
I require a lot of fresh towels
and nightly turndown service.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.754
Why would you live in a ho…

18:04.754 --> 18:06.923
Oh, I, I see.

18:06.923 --> 18:11.217
The comfort of being able
to check out on a whim.

18:14.863 --> 18:17.200
You know, as much as 
you've explained it,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.852
you've never really explained it.

18:19.852 --> 18:22.176
I demand only one thing
in a relationship, Christine,

18:22.176 --> 18:25.465
that I remain utterly alone.

18:28.432 --> 18:30.888
Nice out, Alan. —I'm sorry?

18:30.888 --> 18:32.870
Even in conversation,

18:32.870 --> 18:37.025
you always have a nice out.

18:38.660 --> 18:42.701
I did my best to control him.

18:42.701 --> 18:45.659
And the other attorney has
brought a motion for sanctions?

18:45.659 --> 18:47.702
Which he wants to argue himself.

18:47.702 --> 18:48.813
Oh, my god.

18:48.813 --> 18:52.274
We count on you to help prevent 
these kinds of situations, Brad.

18:52.274 --> 18:54.052
Paul, I'm a relatively junior partner.

18:54.052 --> 18:55.756
What exactly do you expect me to do?

18:55.756 --> 18:59.058
–If that man gets up in open court…
–Excuse me.

18:59.058 --> 19:00.916
The man can still
handle himself in court.

19:00.916 --> 19:06.562
Oh, please. The only possible
good that could come from his…

19:08.821 --> 19:13.897
Is he adamant about 
arguing this himself?

19:13.897 --> 19:15.790
I'm afraid so.

19:15.790 --> 19:17.057
Well…

19:17.724 --> 19:19.221
I guess we can't say no.

19:19.221 --> 19:23.902
His name is still first on the letterhead.

19:24.954 --> 19:27.743
Let him argue.

19:55.109 --> 19:57.625
We're up early.

19:58.733 --> 20:00.903
I've been up since 6:00, actually.

20:00.903 --> 20:05.214
I've been waiting for you to 
get up so I could say goodbye.

20:05.214 --> 20:06.985
There's a cab outside waiting.

20:06.985 --> 20:08.421
I thought your flight's at 11:00.

20:08.421 --> 20:09.782
I'm going to the airport early.

20:09.782 --> 20:13.545
Ridge upped the security
to level mauve.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.481
Let me drive you. —No.

20:15.708 --> 20:18.409
I, I'd prefer to…

20:19.963 --> 20:23.886
Thank you for getting me out,

20:23.886 --> 20:26.433
for forgiving me.

20:26.705 --> 20:27.747
Well…

20:28.021 --> 20:31.378
That's it. Creep.

20:34.216 --> 20:36.206
Better go.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.775
Call me when you land.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.730
I just think I should argue it.

20:43.730 --> 20:46.950
Why, so you can control me?
Nobody controls me.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.540
Denny, you're the subject
of the hearing.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.662
I'm certainly going to have
more objectivity than…

20:49.662 --> 20:51.885
I'll argue the motion.

20:51.885 --> 20:54.967
When Denny Crane gets attacked,
he stands up for himself.

20:54.967 --> 20:58.167
I don't need you or anybody else
controlling or protecting me.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.880
You're not going to court
in this state. —Brad,

20:59.880 --> 21:02.521
you can join me or not.

21:02.521 --> 21:04.725
Your choice.

21:08.081 --> 21:09.940
What's going on?

21:09.940 --> 21:11.895
He still plans to argue it himself.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.959
–And the partner said let him.
–I know, but I thought…

21:13.959 --> 21:17.451
You know why they're saying let him?

21:17.451 --> 21:19.218
A public debacle on record is just

21:19.218 --> 21:23.480
what they need to convince the full
partnership in January to broom him.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.817
What? —Yeah, they want him
to self-destruct, Brad.

21:26.817 --> 21:31.517
They obviously think losing 
a few clients is worth losing him.

21:31.517 --> 21:35.985
You cannot let him
argue this motion.

21:41.747 --> 21:45.782
You're her guardian, and she slept
in your hotel room last night.

21:45.782 --> 21:48.700
You see, you get upset when I 
don't tell you these things,

21:48.700 --> 21:51.346
but then when I do,

21:51.346 --> 21:52.950
She's gone to Chicago.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.991
It's… –It's not about her.

21:54.991 --> 21:56.113
Excellent. Then…

21:56.113 --> 21:57.964
It, it's us.

21:57.964 --> 22:01.081
–Is there an us?
–Sally, I know this seems difficult.

22:01.081 --> 22:03.154
You know what?
You know what'll be fun?

22:03.154 --> 22:07.458
Can we go shopping for shoes
or a new dress?

22:07.458 --> 22:11.217
Something revealing 
for the office party.

22:11.217 --> 22:13.706
Soft, but…

22:13.706 --> 22:16.001
tight. —Alan.

22:18.094 --> 22:20.794
–What are you doing here?
–My flight was canceled.

22:20.794 --> 22:25.142
I thought you might
feel like an early lunch.

22:25.873 --> 22:29.133
Christine Pauley, Sally Heep.

22:29.133 --> 22:32.540
Hi. It's nice to meet you. —Hi.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.943
Your flight was canceled.

22:33.943 --> 22:35.756
I'm rescheduled at 4:30.

22:35.756 --> 22:38.721
This is why I've refused to fly
for the past two years.

22:38.721 --> 22:40.456
That, and I've been locked up.

22:40.456 --> 22:42.406
–So can I steal you for lunch?
–Actually, no.

22:42.406 --> 22:45.196
–We were just about to go on…
–It's okay, really.

22:45.196 --> 22:47.324
Very nice to meet you.

22:50.039 --> 22:52.808
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

22:56.019 --> 22:58.032
Truth is…

22:58.032 --> 23:00.069
you weren't my first 
choice for lunch.

23:00.069 --> 23:03.139
I called a few friends. Everybody
seems to need a little distance.

23:03.139 --> 23:06.962
It was all like, “oh, Christine,
how nice to hear from you,” and…

23:06.962 --> 23:10.102
You're smart enough to expect that.

23:10.878 --> 23:13.804
Never got it from you.

23:14.549 --> 23:16.879
–Are you and Sally…
–We're seeing each other.

23:16.879 --> 23:18.130
Oh.

23:19.868 --> 23:21.534
She seemed nice. —She is.

23:21.534 --> 23:24.981
Certainly attractive. —There's that.

23:25.783 --> 23:26.957
Well…

23:27.478 --> 23:29.741
it'll be easier when I get to Chicago,

23:29.741 --> 23:32.920
easier to start over there, I think.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.497
I agree.

23:34.497 --> 23:35.957
Yeah.

23:36.462 --> 23:37.984
So…

23:38.315 --> 23:40.180
lunch?

23:40.180 --> 23:42.736
On your next visit.

23:53.066 --> 23:54.144
Well…

23:54.730 --> 23:57.470
Goodbye, then, again.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.598
Um…

23:59.506 --> 24:01.521
Goodbye, Christine.

24:13.312 --> 24:14.083
Denny, listen to me.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.085
Some of the partners are coming 
down to watch the motion,

24:16.085 --> 24:17.183
and not in support, Denny.
They're hoping you crash in there.

24:17.183 --> 24:19.469
They're hoping to be able
to get some leverage

24:19.469 --> 24:20.965
to be able to say
at the partnership meeting,

24:20.965 --> 24:23.126
“it's time to take Denny Crane 
out of the game.”

24:23.126 --> 24:24.837
What game?

24:26.065 --> 24:29.395
I don't know whether he was trying
to humiliate her or hit on her.

24:29.395 --> 24:30.654
It wasn't clear.

24:30.654 --> 24:33.680
What was clear was the 
indecency of it.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.865
This is what lawyering
has degenerated to.

24:36.865 --> 24:38.498
Carrie Lansing lost her husband,

24:38.498 --> 24:40.531
he's probing her about her sex life.

24:40.531 --> 24:42.993
It was a blatant abuse
of our process.

24:42.993 --> 24:46.767
It was an embarrassment to
the integrity of our profession.

24:46.767 --> 24:49.746
This attorney should be
sanctioned severely, your honor.

24:49.746 --> 24:51.763
A message has to be sent to the bar

24:51.763 --> 24:55.849
that our bar is raised higher
than an episode of reality television.

24:55.849 --> 24:58.179
Denny Crane demeaned 
Carrie Lansing,

24:58.179 --> 25:04.146
he demeaned our court system,
and he should be dealt with.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.269
Mr Crane?

25:11.269 --> 25:13.221
Denny, I have a good feel 
for this. Can I take it?

25:13.221 --> 25:15.515
I'll take it.

25:17.526 --> 25:21.970
This is, um, pretty powerful stuff.

25:21.970 --> 25:23.902
I can see Mr Ripley's
a very powerful man.

25:23.902 --> 25:30.059
And that's a big thing with 
lawyers, isn't it? Power.

25:30.059 --> 25:33.025
The fear of feeling weak.

25:33.025 --> 25:37.146
I've seen it before. Attorneys 
coming up against Denny Crane.

25:37.146 --> 25:39.830
They jump, and stomp,
and shake their fists,

25:39.830 --> 25:41.657
and bellow with impassioned rage.

25:41.657 --> 25:44.314
Makes quite a demonstration,
doesn't it?

25:44.314 --> 25:45.473
But when you cut through
to the merits,

25:45.473 --> 25:50.413
this lady has alleged in her 
complaint loss of consortium,

25:50.413 --> 25:53.890
legal terms meaning
sex and affection.

25:53.890 --> 25:57.402
And if she's enjoying 
sex and affection,

25:57.402 --> 25:59.040
it's relevant. It's a mitigating factor.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.759
I'm entitled to explore it.

26:01.759 --> 26:04.365
Mr Ripley may not like it,
but it's legitimate.

26:04.365 --> 26:05.907
And, I may add,

26:05.907 --> 26:11.715
that I conducted my probe in the relative
privacy of a closed conference room.

26:11.715 --> 26:14.566
Mr Powerful man made 
it much more public

26:14.566 --> 26:18.227
with his impassioned
chest-thumping in a courtroom.

26:18.227 --> 26:20.547
I object to this. —Oh, go ahead
and pound the table.

26:20.547 --> 26:24.318
I'll tell you what I object to.

26:24.318 --> 26:29.166
We have an offer on the table
that you so love to pound.

26:29.166 --> 26:32.576
An offer I can't discuss because 
the settlement talks have been sealed.

26:32.576 --> 26:35.880
Suffice to say it is on the high side,
the extreme high side,

26:35.880 --> 26:40.756
considering the fact that 
liability is not certain.

26:40.756 --> 26:44.869
Mr Lansing had a preexisting 
heart condition.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.799
But instead of taking the offer,

26:46.799 --> 26:50.700
powerful guys like Mr Ripley
wanna go to trial. Why?

26:50.700 --> 26:53.754
Because I'm the opponent.

26:55.042 --> 26:59.808
It's a coup to beat the big guy.

26:59.808 --> 27:02.503
Well, what if you don't?

27:02.636 --> 27:05.011
You demean the profession,
Mr Powerful guy.

27:05.011 --> 27:07.260
You're using your client 
to get a notch.

27:07.260 --> 27:13.216
You're making Carrie Lansing go through
the ordeal of a trial for your own ego.

27:13.216 --> 27:16.353
Objection! —A trial you may lose,
in which case, she gets nothing.

27:16.353 --> 27:17.896
Objection! —Oh, but if 
you're loud enough,

27:17.896 --> 27:20.490
Objection! —forceful enough 
and strong enough,

27:20.490 --> 27:25.889
she may never realize
that you blew it.

27:49.186 --> 27:50.329
Brad?

27:50.329 --> 27:51.799
Funny.

27:52.141 --> 27:56.626
You'd like me to feel
threatened, wouldn't you?

27:56.626 --> 27:59.095
I may not be able to talk as fast,

27:59.095 --> 28:04.748
but my tongue is certainly 
more versatile.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.059
You disapprove of me.

28:11.059 --> 28:15.193
And that warms my cockles.

28:15.513 --> 28:17.643
–I'm afraid something's come up.
–Oh, don't tell me.

28:17.643 --> 28:19.768
Her flight left an hour ago.
She's gone.

28:19.768 --> 28:21.719
So…

28:21.719 --> 28:23.475
Shopping.

28:23.475 --> 28:26.321
Maybe not shoes…

28:26.321 --> 28:28.708
but something…

28:29.397 --> 28:34.800
slippery to perhaps slide 
out of later.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.916
I'm not that easy.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.258
Well, I am.

28:50.711 --> 28:52.815
Do you feel responsible
for her being in there?

28:52.815 --> 28:55.432
I certainly was 
a precipitating factor.

28:55.432 --> 28:57.789
Is she well now?

28:58.601 --> 29:00.751
I think so.

29:00.751 --> 29:04.665
But perhaps I'm inclined 
to believe that.

29:04.665 --> 29:07.213
You might come to value
my latitude on these matters

29:07.213 --> 29:12.212
somewhat more fully on the day
you try to kill me.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.914
I miss you.

29:19.682 --> 29:23.334
I have a friend who has
this amazing house in Vermont.

29:23.334 --> 29:25.935
Maybe for Columbus weekend,
we could sneak up there.

29:25.935 --> 29:27.958
I love Vermont.

29:27.958 --> 29:34.760
Would you allow me to cover 
your body in maple syrup?

29:36.907 --> 29:38.661
Excuse me.

30:00.402 --> 30:02.898
–Where did she stay?
–I have no idea.

30:02.898 --> 30:04.264
I wouldn't even know
where to go look for her.

30:04.264 --> 30:05.939
Well, she clearly knows
where to look for you.

30:05.939 --> 30:07.966
–Alan, she is stalking you.
–She's not…

30:07.966 --> 30:10.885
Crazy? She tried to kill you,
she was institutionalized,

30:10.885 --> 30:13.334
now she's out, 
and she's stalking you.

30:13.334 --> 30:14.937
You said that you were
her legal guardian.

30:14.937 --> 30:15.795
It's a technicality.

30:15.795 --> 30:18.355
Well, you may have certain rights
to have her recommitted.

30:18.355 --> 30:20.086
She hasn't done anything
to warrant that.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.143
At the very least, you could
get a restraining order.

30:22.143 --> 30:24.436
There's nothing to warrant that, either.

30:24.436 --> 30:27.888
Do you really want to 
wait till there is?

30:37.952 --> 30:39.064
Brad.

30:40.429 --> 30:41.642
You hear?

30:41.642 --> 30:44.680
He won the motion and 
settled the case.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.513
You must be disappointed.

30:47.782 --> 30:51.025
I know what you were
hoping for, Paul.

30:51.025 --> 30:53.881
Let me tell you something, my friend.

30:54.714 --> 30:58.283
I have loved and admired Denny Crane
a lot longer than you have.

30:58.283 --> 31:01.023
We all want him to be great.

31:01.023 --> 31:06.395
If you loved him, you wouldn't have
ordered his demise to be public.

31:19.151 --> 31:20.243
Hey.

31:20.672 --> 31:21.974
Hey.

31:23.298 --> 31:27.533
Plaintiff lost his motion for 
sanctions, accepted our offer.

31:27.533 --> 31:31.226
Case is over, settled, done.

31:31.741 --> 31:33.447
I heard.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.113
Denny, you did an incredible job.

31:37.113 --> 31:39.212
I think you turned his own client
against him in there.

31:39.212 --> 31:41.619
Is that what you think?

31:43.573 --> 31:45.601
Am I now to put stock
in what you think?

31:45.601 --> 31:47.505
Denny, I just came here
to congratulate you.

31:47.505 --> 31:50.302
I don't need your praise.

31:55.062 --> 31:58.473
Hardware. Trunks full of praise.

31:58.473 --> 32:01.958
Denny… –I want your respect.

32:02.679 --> 32:04.545
I'm senior partner.

32:04.545 --> 32:07.761
Respect goes with the job.

32:08.542 --> 32:11.427
Not to mention I've earned it.

32:17.005 --> 32:19.556
I've earned it.

32:22.898 --> 32:29.452
Don't you think I feel 
the wagons circling?

32:31.716 --> 32:32.770
Now comes the plaintiff.

32:32.770 --> 32:35.380
Hereinafter, the alleges
and charges as follows.

32:35.380 --> 32:41.158
Count one, on September 11th
in the year of our lord…

32:42.327 --> 32:45.130
I'm so, so sorry.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.934
–I came to see you last night, only…
–Why did you not go to Chicago?

32:47.934 --> 32:51.145
I decided to collect a few letters 
of recommendation before I leave.

32:51.145 --> 32:53.478
–If I'm going to try…
–You could do that by phone.

32:53.478 --> 32:55.392
I could, and I planned to,

32:55.392 --> 32:57.747
but Bernie Levinson, senior 
partner at my old firm,

32:57.747 --> 32:59.795
insists on meeting me in person.

32:59.795 --> 33:03.364
Evidently, he wants to 
be sure I'm not nuts.

33:03.364 --> 33:08.540
So I'm seeing him at 2:00,
I fly out at 6:00.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.685
All right, so…

33:10.685 --> 33:12.667
why'd you come to find me last night?

33:12.667 --> 33:16.784
You weren't picking up
your cell, and…

33:16.784 --> 33:20.652
Alan, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea you were on a date.

33:20.652 --> 33:22.138
I shouldn't have come at all.

33:22.138 --> 33:28.648
I, I realized that. I left as soon as
I saw the expression 
on your face and…

33:28.648 --> 33:32.875
I truly, truly apologize.

33:32.875 --> 33:36.246
I have to be honest, Christine,
it scared…

33:36.246 --> 33:39.446
the hell out of me.

33:39.446 --> 33:40.853
Believe me,

33:40.853 --> 33:44.473
if I had thought for a second
that you were on a date…

33:44.473 --> 33:46.741
Sally, is it, is it serious?

33:46.741 --> 33:48.953
I really don't want 
to talk about it.

33:48.953 --> 33:51.790
May I ask why not?

33:52.801 --> 33:55.577
We're friends, are we not?
Good friends.

33:55.577 --> 33:58.727
It's only natural for us to discuss 
our lives with each other.

33:58.727 --> 34:01.958
I really don't want 
to talk about it.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.886
Are you embarrassed?

34:06.226 --> 34:09.136
Is this just some young thing
you like to screw…

34:09.136 --> 34:14.579
dinner and a quickie, 
something casual?

34:15.774 --> 34:19.554
I'm sorry.
That was inappropriate. I…

34:20.268 --> 34:22.263
Maybe I still do get pangs.

34:22.263 --> 34:28.578
Anyway, I, again, apologize
for just showing up last night.

34:28.578 --> 34:33.199
I think I will leave
before this gets awkward.

34:52.335 --> 34:55.149
Why don't we rent a nice 
restaurant for these things?

34:55.149 --> 34:57.661
Because it's all about
impressing the clients,

34:57.661 --> 35:01.767
who like to know that inflated 
fees buy fancy offices.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.164
Hey, how you doing?

35:03.164 --> 35:06.484
Brad. Just talking about you.

35:08.049 --> 35:10.379
Okay, we weren't.

35:10.379 --> 35:11.740
Sally, would you dance with me?

35:11.740 --> 35:13.371
Well… —Oh, that's right.

35:13.371 --> 35:15.181
You're with big Al. Tara.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.209
I'd love to.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.136
They make a lovely couple,

35:19.136 --> 35:22.340
and he's got a nice, tight ass,
don't you think?

35:22.340 --> 35:24.358
You think?

35:28.167 --> 35:29.283
Oh.

35:30.956 --> 35:32.069
Christine?

35:32.069 --> 35:33.312
Something's come up.

35:33.312 --> 35:35.895
Nothing bad.
It's great, actually,

35:35.895 --> 35:38.863
but I think I better discuss 
it with you in person.

35:38.863 --> 35:40.368
Can I steal two minutes?

35:40.368 --> 35:41.664
I'm at an office party.

35:41.664 --> 35:43.375
Can you tell me about it
over the phone?

35:43.375 --> 35:47.500
I'd really prefer to do 
it in person.

35:59.497 --> 36:01.938
Congratulations.

36:08.782 --> 36:12.833
–Denny, I…
–I accept your congratulations.

36:12.833 --> 36:16.965
Don't linger like we're friends.

36:17.686 --> 36:21.001
We used to be friends.

36:21.001 --> 36:24.211
We used to sit out on balconies 
at night as kids

36:24.211 --> 36:29.151
and criticize each other's
openings and closings.

36:29.151 --> 36:31.287
Remember those days, Denny?

36:31.287 --> 36:38.534
When we were open to each 
other's criticism and candor?

36:39.441 --> 36:42.631
“Open” is a funny choice of word.

36:42.631 --> 36:46.697
You're a out-in-the-open
sort of fellow, Paul?

36:46.697 --> 36:52.529
You know exactly what 
sort of fellow I am.

36:52.529 --> 36:57.286
I'm still a good lawyer.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.415
Yes, you are.

37:03.366 --> 37:06.850
You remember Muhammad Ali's
last fight?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.478
We had ringside seats.

37:08.478 --> 37:11.770
He lost so pathetically to Larry Holmes.

37:11.770 --> 37:14.729
We were so crushed.

37:14.729 --> 37:18.675
The tragedy that night, Denny,
wasn't that he couldn't still box.

37:18.675 --> 37:19.889
He could.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.255
The tragedy was…

37:22.255 --> 37:27.032
that he still thought he was Ali.

37:28.048 --> 37:31.874
You're a good lawyer, my friend.

37:31.874 --> 37:35.916
You're just not Denny Crane.

38:05.669 --> 38:08.159
Hanging out with all your friends?

38:08.159 --> 38:10.499
Whoever designed women's shoes…

38:10.499 --> 38:12.148
May I?

38:15.197 --> 38:20.117
Nothing personal.
It's a fetish.

38:21.626 --> 38:23.609
Your fingers are so…

38:23.609 --> 38:25.723
Yes, thank you.

38:25.723 --> 38:29.292
My uncle was a butcher.

38:32.112 --> 38:34.616
Don't you think Sally might 
object to this?

38:34.616 --> 38:37.363
We're nonexclusive
when it comes to feet.

38:37.363 --> 38:41.657
Oh, dear, you have a bunion.

38:45.319 --> 38:47.444
Did you come in here for something?

38:47.444 --> 38:51.918
Why are you counseling Sally
to distance herself from me?

38:51.918 --> 38:53.866
There are happily ever after guys,

38:53.866 --> 38:56.606
and there are those
who leave girls in a heap.

38:56.606 --> 38:58.218
And I can tell the difference.

38:58.218 --> 39:01.608
You speak from personal experience?

39:01.608 --> 39:04.942
That's private.

39:05.902 --> 39:09.278
Then perhaps I should get to 
know you better

39:09.278 --> 39:13.394
and ask again.

39:14.416 --> 39:16.982
And I'd love to.

39:16.982 --> 39:22.821
but right now, I'm going to 
go dance with Sally.

39:47.747 --> 39:49.904
This is nice.

39:50.276 --> 39:53.873
I know a cozy little photocopying 
machine we could adjourn to.

39:53.873 --> 39:55.535
You're expecting a visitor, remember?

39:55.535 --> 39:59.949
She said it would take two minutes.

40:01.498 --> 40:03.851
She's beautiful.

40:03.851 --> 40:04.863
Excuse me?

40:04.863 --> 40:07.086
She's here.

40:11.447 --> 40:14.828
And she's beautiful.

40:20.770 --> 40:23.756
Time me. Two minutes.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.890
Christine, you look stunning.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.187
Well, I knew you were
having a fancy party.

40:30.187 --> 40:33.961
I didn't want to appear conspicuous,
so I threw something on.

40:33.961 --> 40:35.485
I see.

40:35.485 --> 40:36.913
And what did you want
to talk about?

40:36.913 --> 40:41.305
–Well, can we go to your office?
–I'd prefer not.

40:42.809 --> 40:45.014
Well, being that I just showed up
at your date the other night,

40:45.014 --> 40:46.708
I didn't want you to think 
I was following you.

40:46.708 --> 40:47.866
You know I wouldn't do that, right?

40:47.866 --> 40:51.100
What have you come
to talk about, Christine?

40:51.100 --> 40:54.644
My meeting with Bernie Levinson
went incredibly well,

40:54.644 --> 40:56.892
and…

40:56.892 --> 40:59.104
Well, he's rehired me.

40:59.104 --> 41:01.192
I can start as soon as Monday.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.789
Can you believe it?

41:03.789 --> 41:05.937
What about Chicago?

41:05.937 --> 41:11.897
The truth is I think I have a better 
chance at achieving normalcy in Boston.

41:11.897 --> 41:15.260
I called Dr Gill. 
He agreed, the less change,

41:15.260 --> 41:16.096
the better.

41:16.096 --> 41:18.107
I can see him as 
an outpatient, and…

41:18.107 --> 41:20.457
Your guardians, your parents,
are in Illinois.

41:20.457 --> 41:24.682
I was released to you
in Massachusetts.

41:24.682 --> 41:27.595
I was afraid you'd freak
if I told you this on the phone,

41:27.595 --> 41:30.701
or if you just ran into me
at the courthouse.

41:30.701 --> 41:35.622
This is why I wanted to give 
you the news in person.

41:35.622 --> 41:37.450
Okay.

41:37.756 --> 41:40.941
It's truly fantastic news.

41:40.941 --> 41:44.858
Isn't it, Alan?

41:47.057 --> 41:50.013
I got my old job back.

41:50.013 --> 41:51.775
Yes.

41:54.154 --> 41:56.864
It is.

42:01.302 --> 42:05.158
