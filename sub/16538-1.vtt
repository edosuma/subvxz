03:08.417 --> 03:10.958
Guy?

03:11.042 --> 03:18.333
I know you can hear me.
I need you to do something.

03:18.427 --> 03:21.167
Guy, you need to trust me.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.717
You need to wake up!

03:46.017 --> 03:47.917
Har...Har...Harry?

03:48.717 --> 03:49.775
Harry?

03:52.438 --> 03:55.750
Harry? Are you there? Come in.

03:57.599 --> 03:58.899
Harry?

04:04.667 --> 04:09.042
Harry! Come back to me, when I need you.
You bugger, Harry.

04:16.375 --> 04:21.750
No, no, no. Come on. I'm still...
Don't lose me. Come on.

04:23.042 --> 04:26.083
What the fu...please...

04:29.667 --> 04:33.417
Come on, come on, come on.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.250
Come on, you stupid...

04:44.708 --> 04:47.375
Come on. Come on.

04:53.875 --> 04:58.042
Okay. Okay. Alright.

04:58.125 --> 05:03.000
Don't be serious. Don't be serious.
You can breathe.

05:04.083 --> 05:08.458
You can breathe. You can breathe, Guy. Come on.

05:08.542 --> 05:13.333
Don't look at the dial. Come on.
You can breathe. You can breathe.

05:13.417 --> 05:17.500
Deep Breaths. Deep, deep breaths.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.500
Come on. Don't look at the dial.

05:22.625 --> 05:26.667
Fylingdales? Harry?

05:26.783 --> 05:34.875
Harry? Fylingdales? Ah...Fylingdales, I'm here.
Hermes do you see...?

05:34.958 --> 05:39.417
Come in...Harry, I can't...

05:41.167 --> 05:44.542
Harry, I can't understand you.
You are breaking...breaking up too badly.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.333
Harry?

05:49.625 --> 05:54.250
How do I fix this? Oh, shit!

05:56.500 --> 05:58.792
Oh God!

06:00.042 --> 06:03.250
Great going, Guy. Well done.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.383
Shit.

06:20.708 --> 06:24.375
What are you? What are you? What are you?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.917
Well. Come on, Hermes.

06:58.167 --> 07:02.792
OK! There we are. It's coming. Come on.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.792
Yes.

07:14.375 --> 07:17.292
Hermes?

07:17.375 --> 07:20.417
Right.

07:41.750 --> 07:46.208
Come on. Come on.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.325
Shit!

08:21.208 --> 08:24.250
Come on. Shh!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I love you, Lottie.

08:44.082 --> 08:48.750
That's how you do it!
That's how you do it!

08:55.375 --> 08:59.125
That's not right! That's not right!

09:05.358 --> 09:06.858
Hermes...are you there? Come in.

09:06.958 --> 09:10.417
Hermes, this is Fylingdales.
Are you receiving me?

09:10.500 --> 09:15.583
I repeat: Hermes, this is Fylingdales.

09:15.667 --> 09:19.458
Guy, it's Harry.
Would you respond what's happening!

09:19.558 --> 09:20.958
Harry! Harry!

09:21.042 --> 09:25.833
Oh! Thank Christ!
Guy, where the bloody hell were you?

09:25.917 --> 09:31.333
I was taking a flight to France
on my day off now.

09:31.417 --> 09:37.125
Where the hell you think I was? Where were you?
We thought we'd lost you when we couldn't radio you.

09:37.208 --> 09:41.875
Don't you dare make me go through it again.
Frightened us enough on this flight.

09:41.958 --> 09:46.292
Harry, Harry is...

09:47.583 --> 09:51.500
is Lottie there? Is she with you?

09:51.583 --> 09:55.167
No, she is not in the room right now, Guy.

10:00.042 --> 10:06.958
I think I must be losing Oxygen.
Harry, dial's going crazy.

10:07.042 --> 10:10.625
Everything was fine, then ah...

10:11.708 --> 10:16.458
I can't remember the last few minutes.

10:16.542 --> 10:20.042
What the hell went wrong?
How do I fix this?

10:22.125 --> 10:25.375
We will take look at it, Guy.
We lost you just before pre-flight.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.042
No telemetry was received from Hermes,
before the system was rebooted.

10:30.125 --> 10:35.542
Graham and his team are going through everything as quickly
as they can to solve this, to find out how to get it right.

10:35.625 --> 10:40.115
There aren't too many options, Guy.
I've never seen Graham move so fast.

10:40.218 --> 10:44.333
He is breaking sweat. You'd be impressed.
I need you to get him details, Guy.

10:44.433 --> 10:46.317
Guy, be specific.

10:47.417 --> 10:52.625
Alright. But I don't really know specifics.

10:55.083 --> 11:00.750
The suit vented Oxygen,
there would be nothing to breathe. I...

11:02.375 --> 11:05.875
I got blacked-out.

11:06.958 --> 11:12.667
Well how long did you lose me for?
We have no indication down here that you blacked out.

11:12.750 --> 11:18.292
Doc, you reading this?
What are medical saying?

11:19.958 --> 11:24.375
Harry?
Hold on, Guy. We're gonna answer for you.

11:24.458 --> 11:29.458
Harry, don't tell me to hold. Not now.

11:33.875 --> 11:38.417
We lost medical when we lost you.
It's gonna take him a few to figure this one out.

11:38.500 --> 11:44.292
My guess you probably were out two minutes.
At the most three. How do you feel?

11:45.417 --> 11:49.208
Three...three minutes?

11:49.292 --> 11:54.792
Harry, felt longer than three minutes.

11:54.875 --> 11:58.333
I've lost half my Oxygen.

11:59.417 --> 12:03.833
I just had to fix the suit's electrical circuits.

12:03.917 --> 12:09.125
That is if it worked, don't know.
I haven't tested it.

12:09.208 --> 12:14.458
Actually I don't know if I can test it up here. Can you?
We will check the diagnostics.

12:18.042 --> 12:23.667
Why the hell did the suit fail? Hmm?
Don't you chaps meant to test these things?

12:23.750 --> 12:29.208
I wouldn't want to guess...not until the team
is done finished trolling through the readout.

12:30.292 --> 12:35.217
Well...can you work faster? I'm a...

12:35.500 --> 12:39.667
I'm struggling to breathe a bit. Harry?
Chest feeling really tight.

12:46.042 --> 12:48.458
Come on.

12:48.542 --> 12:53.375
Guy? I'm slightly worried what
the Doc is telling me.

12:53.458 --> 12:59.292
Be aware you may have the beginning of hypoxia.
We need you to act fast on this.

12:59.375 --> 13:03.167
First thing is first.
What does your Oxygen read?

13:05.583 --> 13:10.417
Says 21, figures two and one.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.083
But I'm currently only breathing
Oxygen in the capsule, Harry.

13:14.167 --> 13:19.583
We know, Guy. But that's not going to be enough.
It's not designed for longtime life support without the suit.

13:19.667 --> 13:26.708
I'm not intending to be up here that long though.
We need to get you more Oxygen. Take it easy. Slow breaths.

13:26.792 --> 13:30.042
Graham's checking the circuits.
Hopefully you fixed it.

13:30.142 --> 13:36.833
For the moment breathe easy.
Calm and slow. Calm and slow.

13:36.917 --> 13:42.417
You are missing this view, Harry. It's beautiful.

13:43.792 --> 13:49.167
I see everything. Every cloud.

13:49.250 --> 13:55.958
Every river, every city alike
with life and color.

13:56.042 --> 14:02.000
Oh, please! Do keep on roping it in.
I will.

14:02.083 --> 14:06.458
Right until the moment you will punch me.
Sounds about right.

14:06.542 --> 14:11.292
Now, I know you might slack off,
but how about you shoot some film for us?

14:11.375 --> 14:16.292
Now that you have that beautiful view to look at,
actually do some work up there.

14:16.375 --> 14:21.583
We are looking forward to developing those high
altitude shots you have been taking.

14:23.875 --> 14:30.133
Six minutes down, four to go.
Good. Take what you can and don't waste it.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.292
That's a shame, Harry.

14:38.375 --> 14:42.333
If you hadn't changed you mind
on your desk job...

14:42.417 --> 14:46.667
after you had been a kerosene jockey...

14:48.583 --> 14:55.042
You could have been the one up here.
I'm not ashamed. Not ashamed at all.

14:55.125 --> 15:00.333
I just lost faith in what we were doing,
and who we were doing it for.

15:00.417 --> 15:05.667
I do miss the Americans RB45.
What a wonderful large bird.

15:05.750 --> 15:11.208
How's the wife?
I see you haven't lost your sense of humor up there.

15:11.292 --> 15:17.250
Those are the only ones I can choose.
What do you expect? Bad influence like you around?

15:17.333 --> 15:21.433
Do you know, what your problem is Taylor, Old boy?
You never could take orders from someone...

15:21.527 --> 15:24.792
unless you respected them and
believed in the cause.

15:24.875 --> 15:31.875
And that's my friend, is why today you are up there
having all the fun and I'm down here.

15:31.958 --> 15:37.750
It's certainly not fun now.
Turns out, today isn't my day.

15:39.458 --> 15:44.067
I rather be flying 45s again with you.

15:44.180 --> 15:48.875
Maybe, without the Americans,
telling us what to do.

15:53.292 --> 15:57.860
Looking forward to Gin & Tonic in the bar when you get me back.
It's a deal.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.817
Harry?
Yes, Guy?

16:08.250 --> 16:11.375
Is there a chance I could speak to Lottie again?

16:11.458 --> 16:16.125
You spoke with her a few hours ago.
You have to wait till you land.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.375
Don't worry, Guy.

16:20.458 --> 16:23.458
Well keep me updated.

16:24.542 --> 16:30.067
Six hours, 130 miles up.
Four times around the world.

16:31.250 --> 16:36.458
That's enough for me.
Hermes, this is Graham. How are you, Taylor?

16:36.542 --> 16:43.250
Oh! I'm splendid, Graham....I'm just waiting
on you to tell me how I can get back home.

16:43.333 --> 16:47.833
I've been watching everything carefully.
But need you to confirm a few readings before we start.

16:48.917 --> 16:52.192
Roger that.
We've been just going through the diagnostics now.

16:52.292 --> 16:54.775
It's saying Oxygen is at 19 still?

16:54.875 --> 16:58.875
One-nine. Is that correct?
Ah...correct.

16:58.958 --> 17:03.000
Good. That seems to be holding steady now.
Now, the fuel level?

17:03.083 --> 17:09.000
It says 30, figures three-zero.
That's correct.

17:09.083 --> 17:14.025
Telemetry is telling me that
you are ten degrees to lean port.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.905
Can you correct it?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.833
Oh! Graham? There is no response
from the control stick.

17:20.916 --> 17:26.250
Ah! Right. Hmm...hold please.
No, Gra...

17:26.333 --> 17:31.092
Graham...don't ask me to hold.
If there is a problem, then, just tell me.

17:38.500 --> 17:43.317
There's nothing we can see on a readout down here.
Hermes still looks good for re-entry.

17:45.958 --> 17:47.417
Alright.

17:50.458 --> 17:56.292
I really need you to put my wife back on, Harry.
I can't.

17:56.375 --> 18:01.042
Please put her back on.
Not right now.

18:01.125 --> 18:04.500
But, we'll try and get her here.

18:05.583 --> 18:12.167
Guy, do me a favor?
Checkout your flight manual. Page 24.

18:21.967 --> 18:27.467
To my Spaceman, I love you Fly safe
Love Lottie

18:55.125 --> 18:57.458
I'm going up.
You got through!?

18:57.558 --> 18:58.442
I did.

18:58.542 --> 19:03.292
Harry said yes, so it's me.
Oh! I'm so happy for you.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.833
For us, Lottie,

19:06.917 --> 19:08.667
this is for our sake.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.292
This is the beginning of something big...

19:14.375 --> 19:17.250
I don't know how much!
I know! I've always known.

19:17.333 --> 19:22.542
The first British man in space.
The first man in space.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.458
Five years as a test pilot and I am here...

19:26.542 --> 19:32.292
at the frontier of science and technology.
I'm going up!

19:34.375 --> 19:38.958
It's going to be a tough few months.
I know, in this case. But you are up to it?

19:39.042 --> 19:44.417
You know how tough it was, when the Americans had
you flying over Eastern Europe. I'll be here with you.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.458
By your side. Trust me.
Now tell me everything. I want to know.

19:49.542 --> 19:54.208
The launch is scheduled for December 4th.
It's a one day trip.

19:54.292 --> 19:59.667
So you'll be home on time for Christmas then, Mr.Spaceman?
Yes.

19:59.750 --> 20:04.542
Guy? Guy?

20:04.625 --> 20:09.542
You find it?
Yeah I did. Yeah.

20:09.625 --> 20:15.958
When did you put this on here, Harry?
Will I be telling? A man has to have  his secrets.

20:16.042 --> 20:19.625
You...you are full of them.

20:21.938 --> 20:22.998
Thank you.

20:34.250 --> 20:38.417
I'll be home soon.
Yes, you are.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.458
Guy? It's time.

20:45.625 --> 20:50.042
We are ready to go here, after your checks.
Three minutes to window.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.002
Roger that.

20:54.667 --> 21:02.252
Thrusters to auto mode. Check.

21:02.375 --> 21:06.417
Power control to auto. Check.

21:06.500 --> 21:10.875
Reserve System off. Check.

21:10.958 --> 21:16.375
Gyro-stabilizers off. Check.

21:17.792 --> 21:22.792
Suit, Oxygen. On.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.875
Check.

21:36.542 --> 21:40.125
Come on.

21:49.167 --> 21:52.333
Okay, okay.

22:04.792 --> 22:09.583
Whenever you're ready, Guy. We're ready.
Hit the switch.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.333
Here we go.

22:12.417 --> 22:18.480
Oh! Jee! Oh Bugger! Shit! Harry?

22:18.583 --> 22:21.833
Harry? Oh God!
Hello? Oh God!

22:23.917 --> 22:27.158
Ok...

22:27.542 --> 22:30.708
Come here.

22:37.167 --> 22:41.958
Come on, Hermes! Come on!

22:45.583 --> 22:50.152
Oh God! Come on, Hermes. Come on.

22:53.167 --> 22:56.542
What's that? What is it? What's that?

23:10.625 --> 23:13.667
Oh! Shit.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.583
Oh! Come on, Hermes!

23:22.375 --> 23:27.167
Don't fight me. Don't...

23:41.750 --> 23:44.292
Come on!

23:48.683 --> 23:53.125
Oh God! Come on.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.333
Come on, Hermes! Come on!

24:06.417 --> 24:10.292
Come on! Wake up, please!

24:12.125 --> 24:15.458
Come on!

24:17.333 --> 24:22.167
Yeah. Okay. Alright! That's it.

24:22.250 --> 24:26.667
Okay. Okay. Yeah!

24:26.750 --> 24:28.958
That's it.

24:33.708 --> 24:38.750
Come on. Easy. Easy. That's it.

24:40.625 --> 24:41.792
Come on.

24:45.292 --> 24:49.292
That's it! That's it!

24:49.375 --> 24:53.583
Easy easy. Yes.

24:53.667 --> 24:57.583
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.667
Fyling...

25:04.750 --> 25:09.625
Fylingdales, come in.

25:11.625 --> 25:15.042
Harry?

26:02.958 --> 26:07.875
This is mission control. Taylor, come in.

26:07.958 --> 26:13.250
Guy this is...This is mission control.
Guy, please respond.

26:13.333 --> 26:19.375
This is mission control. Please come in.
If you are there, we can't read you.

26:19.458 --> 26:25.958
I can't get hold of him. Not there!
Guy, if you're there, please respond!

26:26.042 --> 26:29.875
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
Thank God. Oh! You bastard!

26:29.975 --> 26:31.875
You alright? What happened? 

26:33.542 --> 26:37.625
What's wrong with Hermes?

26:37.708 --> 26:42.125
Oh! My God! My head is dizzy. Ok?

26:45.292 --> 26:49.500
Oxygen still on 19...19.

26:49.583 --> 26:53.917
I'm not feeling alright. Can't think straight.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.167
If you thought putting a 9G loop was bad, Harry,
you should have a go on this.

26:59.250 --> 27:05.333
Feels like I got off bloody Wallis's.
I can't see.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.667
Relax for a moment.
Take your time you need to sit and think.

27:09.750 --> 27:16.917
Air in the compartment be enough for a short while.
Short...short while? How long is a short while, Harry?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.200
Taylor? It's Graham. 
Hello Graham.

27:18.290 --> 27:21.875
What exactly does your fuel read-up say up there?

27:23.875 --> 27:28.708
Tank 22, figures two-two.

27:31.292 --> 27:36.333
No, no Graham. It's...it's reading 20.

27:36.417 --> 27:40.583
What else happened up there, Taylor?

27:40.667 --> 27:46.958
Well I can't...You know what, Graham? You tell me.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.375
Just get me down from here, fellas.

27:55.083 --> 28:01.500
Harry? How what about that re-entry window?
How much time do we have left?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.667
It's already gone, Guy.

28:18.417 --> 28:24.125
No...Harry, you said that...
We can't bring you down just yet.

28:24.208 --> 28:29.542
Not until we find out, what is wrong with capsule.
How it happened and how to fix it.

28:29.625 --> 28:35.208
What? That's not good enough, Harry.
Understood.

28:35.292 --> 28:40.333
I'm going to take you off the scope-box,
so...so it's just me.

28:46.500 --> 28:50.208
Guy, it's just me now.

28:51.583 --> 28:55.333
Harry, what's going on?
What are you not telling me?

28:55.417 --> 28:59.333
We are...not really sure what to say about it.

28:59.417 --> 29:03.042
Harry. Mate. Come on.

29:03.125 --> 29:07.875
It's me. What's going on?

29:07.958 --> 29:14.000
You know procedure. The way this works.
We can't bring you down. Not after this. Not yet.

29:14.089 --> 29:18.025
We're trying everything we can. I assure you.

29:18.118 --> 29:22.383
Well, clearly what you're doing isn't good enough!
No of this should have happened.

29:22.483 --> 29:24.567
No, but it has.

29:24.667 --> 29:30.208
We are fixing it. Everyone here is working
to get you down here safe and sound.

29:30.292 --> 29:35.542
Harry, the problem is up here.
It's not down there.

29:35.625 --> 29:40.292
I don't see how you can.
What do you mean? One minute, Guy.

29:43.583 --> 29:47.083
Do it! If that's the way, do it!

29:49.167 --> 29:53.542
Listen Guy, Graham is going to walk through
a procedure, we need you to do right now.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.375
Ah! Yes. Roger that.

29:56.458 --> 30:01.625
Listen to me carefully.
Our systems report, you have a fuel leak.

30:01.708 --> 30:06.875
Your port thruster has failed.
It's probably damaged.

30:06.958 --> 30:11.052
The diagnostics appear to indicate the
control circuits are still functional.

30:11.152 --> 30:13.792
So we can only presume,
it is something with physical damage.

30:13.875 --> 30:18.075
Physical damage? No!
We need you to shut off that valve for that thruster.

30:18.175 --> 30:21.658
Graham? What do you mean by physical damage?
We have to keep what is remaining...

30:21.758 --> 30:24.225
Graham, listen to me. Physical damage!?
How the hell did a thruster fail?

30:25.208 --> 30:31.292
Have you sent me here with anything that isn't fucked?
We have our best men going through your telemetry now.

30:31.375 --> 30:35.833
Hermes has a million and one parts.
This is cutting edge British technology.

30:35.917 --> 30:40.125
Really it could be anything.
An overload is always on the cards.

30:40.208 --> 30:44.692
An overload? This isn't an overload.
This isn't just an overload.

30:44.792 --> 30:46.792
This is my fucking fuel supply!

30:46.875 --> 30:52.917
First my bloody Oxygen and now my sodding fuel!
Guy, you need to trust us.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.375
We have a fix.
We need you to effect that fix quickly.

31:02.042 --> 31:07.125
Alright. Alright. Alright.
What do you want me to do?

31:07.208 --> 31:12.333
The panel is down to your left. There are four valves.
The second one along is for the port thruster.

31:12.417 --> 31:14.467
Close it down.

32:00.708 --> 32:03.375
Jesus!

32:03.458 --> 32:06.667
Come on.

32:09.042 --> 32:14.917
Graham, it hasn't! Hasn't worked! It's not working!
Give it a moment.

32:17.583 --> 32:22.292
Okay, alright, it's a...

32:22.375 --> 32:27.667
Yeah, it's reading 15, figures one-five.

32:29.708 --> 32:34.750
Is that enough to get me home? For re-entry?

32:39.792 --> 32:43.417
Chaps?

32:43.500 --> 32:46.667
It will be enough.
Bloody hope so.

32:46.750 --> 32:52.125
What does your Oxygen read-out say?
It says...

32:52.208 --> 32:56.458
saying 14, figures one-four.

33:00.417 --> 33:04.167
What do I do now? How do I get back?

33:04.377 --> 33:07.275
Guy...we went with our flight patt...

33:07.375 --> 33:11.183
Harry, Harry say again.
Sorry, I lost you there for a minute.

33:11.283 --> 33:12.583
You were breaking up.

33:12.667 --> 33:17.833
Can you hear me? We are working up a flight...
Harry?

33:17.917 --> 33:22.042
God sake! Harry, there someone else on the radio?
Someone else!? No! There's no one else here.

33:22.125 --> 33:27.167
Well, I can hear someone else talking.
Guy, who? What can you hear?

33:27.250 --> 33:32.167
Can you hear me?
I can now. Just about. I'm losing you Harry.

33:32.250 --> 33:38.542
Hold on. Graham...
You are inside restricted airspace.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.625
Harry, Harry! Can you hear that?

33:41.708 --> 33:47.083
Guy, is everything all right?
No! There's somebody else on the radio.

33:47.167 --> 33:52.333
You must immediately change course.

33:52.417 --> 33:57.292
Guy, can you hear me?
Harry? Harry?

33:57.375 --> 34:03.667
Harry, listen, I can hear someone else on the radio,
and I can't understand them.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.375
I think it is Russian.
Guy, did you Russian?

34:06.475 --> 34:08.358
Well...I think so.

34:08.458 --> 34:14.333
No! Don't listen to them. Don't listen to anyone.
Don't talk to Russ...

34:15.542 --> 34:22.167
Harry? Harry? Harry? Harry? Hello?

34:22.250 --> 34:27.333
Come back, Harry. Harry? Fylingdales?

34:33.417 --> 34:37.375
Fylingdales, this is Hermes.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.467
Fylingdales, this is Hermes. Please respond.

34:48.250 --> 34:53.417
Fylingdales? Fylingdales?
This is Hermes. Please respond.

34:55.667 --> 35:00.417
Harry? Graham?

35:03.792 --> 35:06.500
Please come in, Ha...

35:19.042 --> 35:24.417
Fylingdales, I can't hear you, but...

35:25.750 --> 35:31.083
Maybe you can hear me,
so I'm...I'm gonna keep talking.

35:32.167 --> 35:36.250
Listen, there's a lot interference in
radio chatter that I don't understand.

35:36.333 --> 35:40.125
But...I think, maybe it's Russian.

35:41.208 --> 35:44.375
What...what did you mean
"Don't trust them"?

35:46.542 --> 35:50.375
And how come they are getting
though now and you can't?

35:53.958 --> 35:56.958
I don't know what to do to get
you back you were, alright?

35:57.058 --> 36:00.750
So if you are receiving this,
find a way of getting back to me.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.917
Alright...

36:26.250 --> 36:32.250
I realize I'm stuck up here now.
I've missed my re-entry point then...

36:32.333 --> 36:36.750
but my Oxygen is down to 14%.

36:38.417 --> 36:41.167
What the hell am I supposed to do?

37:19.417 --> 37:28.375
Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:56.917 --> 38:01.042
It's beautiful, Lottie!
It is.

38:01.125 --> 38:05.417
In three days you will be in Australia
waiting for your launch window.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.900
I'll be here waiting for you to return...

38:08.990 --> 38:12.850
watching this very view everyday till
you come back and tell me everything.

38:12.943 --> 38:17.208
I'm never gonna leave you after this.
You will be sick of me in no time.

38:17.292 --> 38:23.333
You need not worry so much, Guy. I will be fine.
I'm not worrying. Not yet.

38:23.417 --> 38:29.625
Yes you are. Stay focused on what you have to do.
Don't worry about me, last you come home.

38:29.708 --> 38:33.333
It's important you come home.
We need you to come home.

38:33.417 --> 38:39.542
If ever you are in danger, or if anything goes wrong,
you do whatever you have to do to get back.

38:39.625 --> 38:45.250
Don't be stubborn. Let people help you.
If you are going to look at this view, so will I.

38:45.333 --> 38:51.875
All you have to do is look up.
When the sun shines on you, it shines on me too.

38:51.958 --> 38:57.025
I can't believe you just said that. Idiot.

39:01.333 --> 39:04.467
I should have never done that.

39:32.792 --> 39:38.842
Bloody, cutting edge British technology, eh! Are we?

39:41.792 --> 39:44.175
Don't sound like it.

39:47.708 --> 39:50.150
Not likely making me feel confident.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.995
Or was it heat expansion? Huh?

39:58.958 --> 40:01.917
You warming up again in the sun?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.550
How lovely for you.

40:08.917 --> 40:11.500
Well, listen, the sooner you gonna start...

40:14.208 --> 40:17.000
the sooner we won't have any noises like that.

40:26.125 --> 40:27.442
Ow!

40:38.292 --> 40:43.625
Unidentified spacecraft identify yourself.
Unidentified spacecraft identify yourself.

40:43.708 --> 40:49.125
This is restricted airspace.
How do you have this frequency?

40:49.208 --> 40:53.958
Put me back to Fylingdales. Get off the Comms.
Please change course immediately.

40:54.042 --> 40:58.167
I can't understand you.
Can you understand me?

40:59.250 --> 41:02.917
Hello? Can you hear me down there?

41:03.000 --> 41:09.458
I haven't been able to understand a word.
Not a single bloody word. I don't speak Russian.

41:09.542 --> 41:12.625
No Russian.

41:12.708 --> 41:13.975
No.
No?

41:16.958 --> 41:22.725
No...? No what?
No understand?

41:22.828 --> 41:29.083
No understand?
I...I no understand Russian.

41:30.417 --> 41:33.985
Please speak English.
Is there anyone there who can speak English?

41:35.958 --> 41:40.783
English? You English?
Yes.

41:40.883 --> 41:43.083
You must leave Russian territories now.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.875
You must abort your orbit immediately.

41:46.958 --> 41:51.875
Failure to comply will be treated
as an act of aggression.

41:51.958 --> 41:56.833
You are orbiting on restricted course, Commander Tyler.

41:56.917 --> 42:02.375
How do you know my name?
We hear you.

42:02.458 --> 42:07.667
Your secret is not so well kept.
You must comply now.

42:07.750 --> 42:12.208
Leave Russian airspace.
You give us no option but to take action in turn.

42:12.292 --> 42:16.167
Who...who are you? What...

42:16.250 --> 42:21.792
What have you done with Fylingdales? You jamming them?
Fylingdales, Commander Tyler?

42:21.875 --> 42:26.958
Perhaps you are out of the range for them.
How do you have this frequency?

42:27.042 --> 42:32.042
We track all radio frequency.
Especially those over Russian territory.

42:32.125 --> 42:37.375
Especially those who threaten the U.S.S.R.

42:40.458 --> 42:46.333
Oh? I'm not over Russia.
Which you are, Commander Tyler.

42:46.417 --> 42:51.382
Although, slightly higher.
How do you know who I am?

42:55.542 --> 42:58.708
Bloody, answer me.

42:58.792 --> 43:04.208
Where do you think you are?
What right now?

43:06.375 --> 43:08.775
Hell.
Do no treat me like some fool, Commander.

43:08.875 --> 43:12.875
We've been tracking you past few hours.

43:12.958 --> 43:19.583
Orbiting up in a capsule of some sort.
We tracked your launch from Woomera, Australia.

43:19.667 --> 43:24.542
We did not know what you were until now.
We patched up your radio comm.

43:24.625 --> 43:29.000
This is your fifth time
orbiting around the planet.

43:29.083 --> 43:33.333
This time you have deviated from
your previous course. Why?

43:33.417 --> 43:37.333
No, I'm not off my course.

43:37.417 --> 43:42.708
No, I'm just trying to get home.
I'm just trying to get back to Britain.

43:44.542 --> 43:48.458
That's my mission. That's my only mission.

43:50.958 --> 43:55.650
Unless...unless you can help,
please leave the frequency free.

43:56.333 --> 44:01.333
The British are not capable of such feat.
We are concerned, Commander.

44:01.417 --> 44:06.333
What is your intention, your origin and payload?

44:06.417 --> 44:10.375
I am British, actually.

44:10.458 --> 44:16.458
As for payload...why...what? I'm the payload.
Why they would not help you.

44:16.542 --> 44:22.250
What is your mission? Are you spying for the Americans?
Americans?

44:22.333 --> 44:28.500
You have help from Americans, no?
We did not think the British would be capable of this.

44:29.708 --> 44:35.083
You know, I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
You now do what they cannot.

44:35.167 --> 44:39.333
I must warn you, Commander.
We will retaliate with force.

44:39.417 --> 44:43.125
We shall not stand for this
deception of Russian territories.

44:43.208 --> 44:47.417
No! I...I'm not over Russia.

44:47.500 --> 44:53.083
You are not where you are supposed to be.
Alright. Alright. There where am I?

44:53.167 --> 44:58.667
Your current orbit of position is above,
Tunguska, northern Russia.

45:00.458 --> 45:04.825
Now, how can I believe you when you tell me,
when you won't believe me...?

45:04.925 --> 45:08.892
You can't.
Huh?

45:08.792 --> 45:11.583
But ah...

45:13.500 --> 45:18.417
If what you are saying is true,
then I have a problem.

45:18.500 --> 45:22.833
Yes, Commander. You do.

45:22.917 --> 45:28.250
How can I get so far off course?
You tell us, Commander.

45:30.375 --> 45:34.625
Right, I need to get back. Will you help me?
I do not see how we can.

45:34.708 --> 45:38.658
Well I need to talk to my engineers at Fylingdales.
And I lost contact with them when you came through.

45:38.742 --> 45:43.333
Maybe you could ah...maybe you could patch me
through to them? Put me back in touch.

45:43.417 --> 45:47.333
No. This is not possible.

45:47.417 --> 45:52.125
Well please do something!
No. This is not possible.

45:52.208 --> 45:57.083
I cannot do this. My superiors will
have me shot for doing what you ask.

45:57.167 --> 46:00.833
They are already on their way here to talk to you.
Now...listen to me.

46:00.933 --> 46:02.333
I will not be able to communicate for long.

46:02.417 --> 46:08.542
You seem to be a logical military type, yes?

46:08.625 --> 46:13.750
More than a few years experience.
In what, in the Army?

46:17.583 --> 46:21.417
Do you know I'm just doing my job up here?

46:21.500 --> 46:27.500
Well, you must have seen things.
You must've been places, you won't meant to have been.

46:33.292 --> 46:36.375
I'm suffering major malfunctions.

46:37.458 --> 46:41.125
I don't know what state this ship is in.

46:41.208 --> 46:46.667
I'm gonna need help fix the capsule,
but the longer I stay up here,

46:46.750 --> 46:50.150
the less my chances of survival.

46:52.458 --> 46:56.667
I just...I just want to get back home. Thats all.

46:59.083 --> 47:02.917
Home. Do you understand?

47:03.000 --> 47:09.790
The only way for me to do that is you help me.
Now will you do that?

47:17.583 --> 47:21.550
I cannot help you.

47:22.958 --> 47:28.033
Is that cannot or will not?
You are the only on that can help you.

47:28.133 --> 47:31.033
No one else. It's your choice, Commander.
But I don't know how to fix this!

47:31.033 --> 47:33.750
You must.
Well I don't!

47:33.849 --> 47:37.125
Commander, you have already surprised us
by doing what you have done.

47:37.225 --> 47:40.925
Something no one else in the world
has been able to do.

47:41.028 --> 47:45.458
And seemingly without help from your beloved Ally.
You must know.

47:46.517 --> 47:52.542
We ah, we aim...we aim high.
Too high, by the looks of it.

47:55.208 --> 48:00.000
Harry. Harry, where are you mate?

48:00.083 --> 48:03.667
Come, just fix this. Need a plan. Fix it.

48:03.750 --> 48:07.000
Are you alright, Tyler?

48:09.208 --> 48:14.333
No, not really, I'm feeling...

48:14.417 --> 48:20.917
I'm feeling little disoriented.
I don't know, I can't...

48:26.375 --> 48:31.292
Commander? Commander?
Yes, yes. I'm here.

48:31.375 --> 48:36.917
Take some rest.
I can't. I have to get back.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.458
I really don't have time.
How long since you last slept?

48:44.500 --> 48:48.958
About 28 hours or so.
Maybe you should try now.

48:49.042 --> 48:52.792
Oh! No, I've gone long without sleep.

49:08.667 --> 49:13.083
Tell me your name.
Karnov.

49:15.958 --> 49:21.250
Nice to finally meet you, Karnov.
What do you do if you can't get back?

49:21.333 --> 49:24.375
Alright!

49:24.458 --> 49:30.333
Well I don't think about that.
I...have to get back. I...

49:30.417 --> 49:33.667
I just have to.

49:33.750 --> 49:39.583
Your excursion has attracted unwanted attention.
Not only from Tyuratam.

49:39.667 --> 49:45.208
You can be assured others would know also.
Many people, many nations will not allow you to succeed.

49:45.292 --> 49:49.500
You do not belong...you were not meant do this.

49:49.583 --> 49:55.208
Your journey was a secret. This is the way it'll stay.
We'll ensure that it is.

49:55.292 --> 50:01.500
Goodbye, Ta...you...
What...what do you mean? Ah! Shit.

50:07.292 --> 50:10.417
Karnov?

50:10.500 --> 50:14.458
Karnov? Karnov, what do you mean?

50:14.542 --> 50:19.417
Hello? Ka...fuc...shit.

50:48.458 --> 50:52.208
Bloody...bloody.

51:05.083 --> 51:08.667
You have seen better days.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.333
No.

51:28.417 --> 51:31.708
No, Lottie you're right. I...

51:33.500 --> 51:37.042
I just need to stay focused.

51:39.083 --> 51:42.792
You need to focus, Guy.

52:10.750 --> 52:14.958
Hello, Harry.

52:16.292 --> 52:21.125
You were going to give me the flight corrections.

52:44.667 --> 52:50.292
So 20 second burn, 12 degree pitch...

52:50.375 --> 52:52.550
that's what it comes down to.

52:54.917 --> 52:58.542
CALO reserve shut off.

52:59.625 --> 53:04.083
A.S.C.S OFF.

53:04.167 --> 53:07.708
Dynamic pressure...

53:08.750 --> 53:13.083
ON. And...

53:13.167 --> 53:18.042
Landing bag OFF. OFF. ON.

53:22.958 --> 53:29.917
Rear section brake-way bolts primed
and valve closed down.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.583
Fuck. Oh Shit!

53:39.708 --> 53:43.375
Oh! Fucking hell!

53:45.208 --> 53:49.917
Harry, I've...I've just killed
my last chance to come home.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.958
Harry?

53:53.042 --> 53:58.083
I would have placed Hermes at
the wrong angle...to incinerate.

53:59.417 --> 54:02.192
Fucking hell!

54:03.375 --> 54:04.575
Fucking hell!

54:33.750 --> 54:37.667
Oh shit! Oh shit!
Oh! God, Jesus!

54:48.625 --> 54:53.625
Jesus! Fuck! What was that?

54:56.417 --> 55:03.358
God!
Gosh!

55:33.375 --> 55:36.583
Come on. Come on!

55:52.125 --> 55:55.083
Come on!

55:55.167 --> 55:58.375
Come on!

56:03.292 --> 56:07.083
Thats it! Thats it! Okay.

56:14.667 --> 56:20.375
Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on.

56:42.958 --> 56:45.375
What the fuck was that?

56:48.000 --> 56:53.083
Wait a minute...wait a minute. Okay.

56:53.167 --> 56:56.417
What the fuck is all that?

56:59.083 --> 57:02.958
Oh! Shit. Shit.

57:04.542 --> 57:09.125
You know what, Hermes?
I can tell by the red flashing lights, somethings wrong.

57:09.208 --> 57:14.167
You don't have to shriek at me with
that fucking piercing noise as well!

57:14.250 --> 57:19.375
The only purpose that would serve,
is me open this door and end it all. Alright?

57:25.333 --> 57:29.333
What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing?

57:29.417 --> 57:33.125
Find the problem and try fix.

57:33.208 --> 57:39.458
So...so...that one didn't...do something.

57:43.333 --> 57:47.875
No, that's not...

57:47.958 --> 57:51.417
What do we have...?

57:54.625 --> 57:58.083
The fuse.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.875
Can you hear me?
Hold! Hold please!

01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:14.333
Hold please! Don't go.
Can you hear us?

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:20.542
You copy?
I copy. Hello? Who is...? Who is that?

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:25.708
Please respond.

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:37.167
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:42.333
Fylingdales? Tyuratam?

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:48.500
This is Hermes. Come in. Harry?

01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:53.875
Hermes, this is the United States calling.
Are we reaching you?

01:00:53.978 --> 01:01:01.125
Hermes, please respond. This is the United States.
Are you receiving me?

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:07.375
United States?
Hermes, we were not sure if we could reach you.

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:13.250
I'm here. I copy. Who am I talking to?

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:18.583
Hold you horses there, boy!
What do I call you, Hermes? You have a name?

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:25.125
Yes, I have a name. Do you?
Hermes, we've been aware of your course for sometime now.

01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:30.333
You given us all a surprise down here.
The boys at NASA have been calling us all day.

01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:35.875
Give us your name and purpose of your mission.
No, you know the protocol.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:39.500
Identify yourself. And your interest in me?

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:46.042
I am agent Mike Spann, CIA.
Hermes, we know you are experiencing problems.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:50.125
We maybe be able to assist you.
Assist? Assist me how?

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:55.375
You gotta give me something first.
Name and mission, Hermes.

01:01:55.458 --> 01:02:01.000
Alright, well ah...I assumed you would have known,
I'm Commander Guy Taylor.

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:04.167
Everybody else seems to.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:11.042
This is a planned British mission, and you probably
could tell every thing's going according to plan.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:17.208
And circumstances have got in
the way of us exploring our reach.

01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:21.667
That reach has seemingly taken you
far off course, Taylor.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.375
Look, I've lost contact with
my engineers at Fylingdales.

01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:30.375
Anything you chaps down there,
can do to put in touch with them...

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:33.958
well, it will be a warm beer on me.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:39.333
We'll try to do what we can. When we can.
When you...?

01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:43.042
I'm afraid I need assistance now.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:50.292
No, the chaps at Fylingdales will be able to answer
any question you might have about me or my mission.

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:54.708
Why you in such a hurry, Taylor?

01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:57.792
Every minute I'm up here
is a minute far too long.

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:06.325
I'm running out of Oxygen.
I may not be able to speak to you for too much longer.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.817
And, ah...

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:15.000
Hermes is...well, damaged. I'm not sure how bad is it.
Did you say damaged? What's the damage?

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.292
How much intact do you actually have left?

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:23.833
Well...I don't know what's damaged, exactly.
I can't get to some of the circuits.

01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:29.458
I'm down to ah...I'm down to 6% Oxygen.

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:35.208
After that, then there's nothing.
And my port thrusters damaged too.

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:40.250
So, I had limited maneuverability.
So I can't maneuver, Hermes.

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:46.083
I may...may well have drifted off course.
Now over U.S territory.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:49.083
Well...right now?

01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:54.042
Yes it's possible, yeah. I really can't tell.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:59.858
We understand you've been makin' new friends.
Why you been talkin' to the Russians?

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:01.038
Sorry?

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:07.125
We've been monitoring your communications.
And you were and have been speakin' with the Russians.

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:11.150
No, they spoke to me.
Same difference.

01:04:11.239 --> 01:04:12.233
I beg to differ.

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:16.783
They wanted to chase me out of their airspace.
Is that all they wanted?

01:04:16.883 --> 01:04:24.375
You intercepted the transmissions. Translate it yourself.
As you'd expect, we are already working on that.

01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:29.958
Perfect.
Why aren't you in contact with the British?

01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:34.625
Are you a commie, Taylor?
Been a few years since I hunted commies.

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.000
A commie?

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:44.708
Do...do I've to remind you,
that I'm a British officer?

01:04:44.792 --> 01:04:48.375
I am an ally.

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:54.167
I'm just trying to get back home.
So you were been helped by the Russians?

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:58.708
No, I wouldn't say "helped". No.
They were worse than useless.

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:02.000
Rather like you, now.

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:07.917
Well I don't like your line of questioning.
Look, Taylor...

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.333
We've been clouded to actually
what your intentions are.

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:16.792
Especially have, according to this...

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:20.125
you used to spy for us.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:24.500
You were part of our inner circle.
We know everything about you, Taylor.

01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:29.417
I've just been handed your file.
Oh! And I have a picture of you and you lovely wife here.

01:05:29.517 --> 01:05:31.087
She is beautiful.

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:34.958
You worked for us spying over
Russia in '54, did you not?

01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:38.958
Handpicked as well.
You obviously have some skill in the air.

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:43.500
How do you find flying our RB45?
Nice aircraft, aren't they?

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:49.000
A bit heavy on the rudder I found.
Though I haven't had as many hours in as you.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:56.167
According to your file on several occasions you flew over Russia
on photo reconnaissance sortie for us on operation Jiu Jitsu.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:02.875
Our records indicate 16 times and by my reckoning
that's impressive you weren't shot down.

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:09.625
No. What I did for you guys in 1954, is long over.

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:15.208
In any word, what my superiors ordered me to because your
pilots didn't want to risk their own bloody asses.

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:19.583
You surely do understand, why we are a little
worried by you talking to the Russians.

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:24.125
You seem to be making a habit of talking
to anyone but your own people.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:30.000
Are you fraternizing with the enemy?
What!? No!

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:35.417
We are at war, Mr.Taylor!
No, we're not.

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:41.708
No one is at war with anyone.
Certainly not me, up here.

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:46.417
What the hell is wrong with you?
Do you read the papers over there in England?

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.083
We are all at war with the Russians!

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:55.417
How can we trust you my man?

01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:01.875
Your mission is still unclear to us.

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:06.875
I would be inclined to suggest,
that your intentions towards the United States...

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:12.083
could be considered as hostile.
And therefore, will be treated as such.

01:07:12.167 --> 01:07:15.075
Hostile? You pulling my leg?
Pulling your what now?

01:07:15.175 --> 01:07:19.375
Hostile act is the last thing on my mind.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:23.792
I just want to get home.
I just need to know how to first.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:29.917
Now that's my intention.
I promise you, that's my only intention.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.792
Did you share these intentions with the Russians?
Forget about the fucking Russians!

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:42.500
Have you made contact with Fylingdales?
I'm not at liberty to discuss communication.

01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:48.333
What...even with my own people?

01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:53.708
It's getting bloody cold in here.
Why would that be?

01:07:53.792 --> 01:07:59.167
I had to sacrifice by heaters
to get back control.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:05.500
I see. Then it'll get real cold real quick.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:09.125
Agent Spann?

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:13.292
I need you to help me.

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:20.207
I am down to 5% Oxygen. If that malfunctions,
I don't know how long that would last.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:30.207
If you don't, I most likely
crash land in your back garden.

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:41.667
Was that meant as a threat, Taylor?
No! Of course not. Don't be bloody paranoid.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:48.250
It's no a threat. Just...
It's a reality that would come true if...

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:55.207
if I don't initiate re-entry procedure
and get back in touch with Fylingdales.

01:08:55.292 --> 01:09:01.207
We would have hoped that Britain would
have shared this information with us.

01:09:01.292 --> 01:09:07.457
For crying out loud, you launched a man into space!
Oh well! You can't always get what you want, can you?

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:12.000
You feelin' okay, Taylor?

01:09:13.292 --> 01:09:18.292
You almost...you almost sound concerned.
I am concerned.

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:25.417
We believe the combination of lack of air and your daunting
coldness will almost certainly affect your capabilities.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:31.957
So how about concentrating for me, will ya?
I am concentrating.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.625
Much as I sensibly can.

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:45.667
Listen, Taylor.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:51.457
We are willing to help you,
but need you to do somethin' for us.

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:57.333
We'll affect a safe re-entry if you
land on an area of our choosing.

01:09:57.417 --> 01:10:02.917
That way we can intercept you
and bring you in for safety.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.500
If you are not a commie,
then why are even thinkin' about it?

01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:12.667
You get home. We find out the truth. Everyone wins.

01:10:14.292 --> 01:10:20.000
Are you there, Taylor?
Yeah, I'm here. Just...

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:28.125
You have an answer for me Mr.Taylor?
Let me speak with Harry at Fylingdales.

01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:34.500
No. I can't do that.
I've to talk to Harry. That's my condition.

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:40.417
Without that I'm not willing
to accept your offer.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:45.958
We can entrance safe entry. As fas as I can tell,
you do not have any further options.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:50.583
It's time to get off the fence and do something.

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:56.667
You are either with us or against us.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.208
Which is it, Taylor?

01:11:00.292 --> 01:11:04.000
You haven't exactly left me with much choice.

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:13.008
Where do you want me to land?
Atlantic Ocean. One of our Navy craft...

01:11:13.108 --> 01:11:14.208
USS Borie will meet you there.

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:19.292
She's already been deployed to the area.
Should be there to pick you up when you splash down.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:25.042
So what...what happens now?
I'm gonna put you over to one of my colleagues at NASA...

01:11:25.142 --> 01:11:26.025
Bob Elijah.

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:32.333
He has some calculations to run to work your problem.
And...and that's it?

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:38.333
Of course, Taylor.
Now I've your insurance you'll do as I ask.

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:41.792
Hmm.
Good luck.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:49.125
Hermes, this is Houston.
Are you receiving me?

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:52.417
Houston...Houston this is Hermes.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:59.083
I'm...I'm receiving you. Bob is it?
Yes...yes it is. Nice to meet you, Commander Taylor.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:02.083
Oh! Guy, please. Please call me guy.
Copy that.

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:06.708
I have been advised, I'll to taking you through the procedure
for re-entry based on the calculations I've made.

01:12:06.792 --> 01:12:10.292
I'm not quite at speed with the Hermes design.

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:14.050
There will be some assumptions on my part.
So please forgive me.

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:16.075
Roger that.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:22.417
What do you need me to do?
Let's start with the fuel level, Guy.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.000
A reading...

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:30.958
Ten, figures One-Zero.
Alright, noted.

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:37.875
I'm on 4% Oxygen, Bob.
Can we speed this up a little bit?

01:12:37.958 --> 01:12:41.458
It's rather getting cold in here.

01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:46.792
Alright, I'll try to cut this
down to the bear minimum.

01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:51.583
Roger that.
Everything from now on, will be time critical.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:55.375
Right. Understood.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:13:02.083
Pitch angle minus 466, Roll angle minus 12.321

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:08.458
Yaw 9.418. Turn 1 minute 10 seconds.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.875
Pitch minus 113, burn for 60 seconds.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:20.917
Roger that.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:29.917
Are you sure, we should be planning
for graph for 60 seconds, Bob?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.292
You have a problem with that?

01:13:34.375 --> 01:13:37.958
I don't know, I...

01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:44.208
No...no you know what?
It will suit you in order.

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:50.708
Are you ready?
On my mark, 20 seconds.

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:08.333
Ten seconds, mark. This is it, Guy.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:12.167
We gonna bring you home.

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:24.750
Roger that.
Initiating 60 degree starboard roll.

01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:32.667
You need to lock down the thrusters.
The tracking data looks good, Guy.

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:48.000
I'm at the pre-rotation.
Perfect. Now on my mark, 10 second burn and...

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:54.375
Three, two, one. Mark.

01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:09.417
Bob? Houston, Houston come in!
Come in. Come in Bob!

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:16.000
Downward...invert...put your seat...
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Bob!

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:20.208
Hello? Hello?

01:15:20.292 --> 01:15:23.958
I can't hear you, but thank you.

01:15:24.042 --> 01:15:28.292
Hermes, come in! Can you hear me?

01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:34.083
Hermes. Guy, come in. Please, we can hear you...where?
You are in range.

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:38.792
We tried in vain through Honduras.
That transmitter wasn't enough to get you.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:43.167
You are far off from where we expected.
You were drifting over Russia.

01:15:43.267 --> 01:15:46.150
The Russians saw me, Harry.
They weren't too pleased.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:51.667
I think, may even attacked me with something, God knows what.
Where are you now? What are you doing?

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:57.375
I have started re-entry procedure.
And the Americans...the Americans helped me.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:16:03.500
The Americans? What the....? Charlotte, no, no, no!
I've a right to be here.

01:16:03.583 --> 01:16:09.125
You don't have a right to be here. Out.
Guy! You have to leave. Get her out of here.

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:13.125
No, no Harry! Let her speak.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:17.833
Please mate. Let her be here.
Just let her be here. For a moment.

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:23.125
I won't take long. I promise.
But, I need to...need to speak to her.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:27.667
I have to hear her. Please.
Fine, but just for a moment. You got 1 minute.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.875
I'm worried. Are you alright, Guy?
You're breathing heavily.

01:16:31.975 --> 01:16:33.875
Lottie, darling, I am fine.

01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:37.458
I am fine. I'm alright. I'm fine.

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:44.417
You know, things have been better.
But please don't worry.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.425
I am with you, Guy. I am always with you.

01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:55.250
Don't. You gonna me cry, Lottie.
I'm sorry.

01:16:55.333 --> 01:17:02.292
No, no, no, no. Don't be.
I've waited far too long to hear your voice.

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:07.292
I need you.
I need you too.

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:12.958
I pictured you, you know? I pictured your face.

01:17:13.042 --> 01:17:17.292
You...you been here with me.
You been here the whole time.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:20.417
By my side.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:26.917
Lottie, darling? I can do this.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.792
Harry can tell you that I'm coming home.
Won't you, mate?

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:42.125
Lottie? Lottie? You know that I love you.
I love you too.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:48.167
Goodbye.
No. Not goodbye.

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:51.875
Never "goodbye" but "I will see you soon".

01:17:55.250 --> 01:18:01.500
Guy, you there? Where did they say you are going to land?
In the Atlantic somewhere. I don't know...

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:06.583
They said the USS Borie...the USS Borie
is gonna come pick me up.

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:10.667
Atlantic? You are over Russia right now!
No, no, no Harry! That's wrong.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:14.458
I must be over the Atlantic somewhere. Harry?

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:19.167
I've been a while with the Americans ever since we lost you.
You can't have been speaking with them.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:22.333
O God! I think...I think I'm entering the atmosphere.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.125
Guy? Guy, can you hear me?

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:32.788
Guy, say again! Who have you been talking to?

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:39.333
Guy, who have you been talking to?
Guy, can you hear me?

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:43.250
Come in, Guy. Please come in.
Can you hear me? 

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.000
Oh my God!

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:13.500

01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:18.507

I ask him to call you.

01:20:18.615 --> 01:20:21.667
Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Goodbye.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.357
Very well. And the files?

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:33.583
Makarova?

01:21:40.158 --> 01:21:42.058
Yes. It will be done.

01:21:42.158 --> 01:21:44.328

Everything is ready.
Thank you.

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:03.542
No, I must be over the Atlantic. Harry?

01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:09.375
Oh God! I may have entered the atmosphere!

01:23:17.417 --> 01:23:24.125
Oh God! Shit! What is that?
What's gonna hit me! It hit me.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:29.500
Scheduled path. It's a fucking American craft!

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.000
Hermes. Hermes is severely damaged.
I'm getting warning lights all over the dashboard.

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:13.067
Hermes is severely damaged.
I'm getting warning lights all over the dashboard.

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:17.333
It's like Guy Fawkes lighted here.
I am in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

01:24:17.417 --> 01:24:22.875
It's getting unbelievably hot here now.

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:29.125
Something...something isn't right.
It's not coming down. Nothing is happening.

01:24:29.218 --> 01:24:34.583
This shouldn't be happening!
The parachutes haven't deployed!

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:39.792
I'm frightened, Lottie. I...

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.179
Thank you.
