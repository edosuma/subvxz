WEBVTT

00:01.706 --> 00:03.857
How far would you go
to, uh, get some superpowers?

00:03.977 --> 00:05.344
You mean, like, physically?

00:05.379 --> 00:07.781
Would I go
to modesto, California, or...?

00:07.816 --> 00:10.118
- No, I'm talking...
what would you sacrifice?

00:10.152 --> 00:13.487
Would you cut off your nads?
Tsk.

00:13.522 --> 00:15.490
In exchange for
a cool superpower?

00:15.524 --> 00:17.559
- I can't think
of a superpower that...

00:17.593 --> 00:19.194
- well, what does it do?

00:19.228 --> 00:21.930
What if you could, like,
jump a block at a time?

00:21.964 --> 00:24.200
Yeah, like, the hulk.
That's how he travels.

00:24.234 --> 00:26.068
Think how much
you'd save on gas.

00:26.103 --> 00:29.138
Naah, you get beefy and
you'd have the falsetto voice.

00:29.173 --> 00:30.673
Wait a minute, you get beefy
in terms of what?

00:30.708 --> 00:31.674
You get muscular?

00:31.709 --> 00:32.909
No, you'd bloat up.

00:32.943 --> 00:34.511
You could
get those little implants.

00:34.545 --> 00:36.546
What if you got, like,
a really crappy superpower?

00:36.580 --> 00:38.482
Like claws?

00:38.516 --> 00:39.650
I don't think
I'd miss them at all.

00:39.684 --> 00:40.817
I would do it.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:26.100 --> 01:27.433
welcome to <i>comic book men,</i>

01:27.468 --> 01:30.169
the only show that Batman
can't even stop.

01:30.204 --> 01:31.304
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:31.338 --> 01:32.906
- Walt Flanagan.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.007
- Ming Chen.
- And Michael Zapcic.

01:35.042 --> 01:38.845
- Who would you say hands down,
is your favorite super-team?

01:38.879 --> 01:41.815
I'd do a different generation
of the <i>JLA.</i>

01:41.849 --> 01:43.483
The satellite years.
Yes.

01:43.518 --> 01:45.686
- Firestorm.
- Nuclear man.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.320
Right.

01:46.455 --> 01:48.556
The boy who was inhabited
by his teacher.

01:49.725 --> 01:51.526
I don't remember that.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.694
It's, like,
"what's the character?"

01:52.729 --> 01:54.863
He's a boy and his teacher
enters him

01:54.898 --> 01:57.066
and they become
a superhero together.

01:59.669 --> 02:01.070
All right,
what about you, Walt?

02:01.104 --> 02:03.405
- I'm gonna go <i>avengers.</i>
- Okay.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.441
- I'm gonna
go with Thor, Wonderman...

02:05.475 --> 02:07.509
that graviton era team.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.745
Or no, Nefaria.
Right.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.280
What that stern writing then?
Or shooter.

02:11.314 --> 02:12.682
- Shooter.
- Shooter was writing it.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.417
They've gone so geeky
they've lost even me, man.

02:14.451 --> 02:16.819
They went into a third
comic book language there

02:16.853 --> 02:18.120
where I was, like,
"that's a new one,

02:18.155 --> 02:19.655
what are they talking about?"

02:21.958 --> 02:23.892
What about <i>super friends?</i>

02:23.927 --> 02:25.227
<i>Super friends?</i>

02:25.261 --> 02:26.895
Yeah, <i>super friends,</i>
like the wonder twins.

02:26.930 --> 02:29.298
Pow!
Bro, it's a cartoon.

02:29.332 --> 02:31.833
Oh, my bad.
Not like the comics.

02:31.868 --> 02:34.469
Don't be ridiculous, Bryan.
It's a cartoon.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.972
Wasn't superman's dog
on that team? Krypto?

02:38.007 --> 02:39.674
Wasn't it the dog
with the cape?

02:39.708 --> 02:40.975
He had a dog
but he wasn't on that team.

02:41.009 --> 02:42.409
He wasn't on the team?

02:42.444 --> 02:45.779
<i>Super friends,</i> first they had,
um, Wendy and Marvin.

02:45.813 --> 02:48.181
Two teenagers who had
a dog, wonder dog.

02:48.215 --> 02:49.282
But he didn't
have any superpowers.

02:49.316 --> 02:50.583
They just put a cape on him.

02:50.617 --> 02:52.685
- I did that to my dog.
- Put a cape on him?

02:52.719 --> 02:54.119
- Yeah.
- Aren't they, like, nyah! nyah!

02:54.154 --> 02:55.187
Yes.

02:56.756 --> 02:57.923
And I said, "I'm gonna
tie it even tighter if you"

02:57.957 --> 02:58.924
keep taking it off."

03:07.734 --> 03:10.369
There is a new breed
of celebrity

03:10.403 --> 03:12.004
that tweet each other.

03:12.038 --> 03:13.305
Oh.

03:13.339 --> 03:14.540
Like, when you get
a famous person who tweets

03:14.574 --> 03:15.975
another famous person,

03:16.009 --> 03:17.643
you know they
have their phone number too.

03:17.677 --> 03:19.111
You know they
can just text 'em.

03:19.145 --> 03:20.947
Like, you're
not paying enough attention

03:20.981 --> 03:22.582
to the celebrity so it's,
like, "oh, you know what?"

03:22.616 --> 03:24.651
"I know how I can
get people's attention.

03:24.685 --> 03:27.721
Let me tweet another celebrity
that I know."

03:29.991 --> 03:31.926
I'm talking to you two.
What the hell, man?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.160
- What?
- What are you doing?

03:33.195 --> 03:34.395
- I didn't know,
I thought you were talking...

03:34.429 --> 03:37.097
you were just doing a manifesto.
- Well, I am.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.735
I'm saying it out loud,
but, you know.

03:41.769 --> 03:43.503
Hello.
How are you today?

03:43.537 --> 03:44.904
- I'm great.
- What can we do for you?

03:44.938 --> 03:48.173
Um, basically I need a gift
for my boyfriend.

03:48.207 --> 03:49.608
Boyfriend, okay.

03:49.642 --> 03:53.811
- He's super into spider-man,
but I'm gonna be honest.

03:53.845 --> 03:54.878
I'm, like, in over my head.

03:54.912 --> 03:56.146
I don't know
anything about this.

03:56.180 --> 03:57.848
With the relationship,
or you mean with the gift?

03:59.417 --> 04:00.584
- Thanks.
- What's the occasion?

04:00.618 --> 04:01.785
- It's his birthday.
- Birthday.

04:01.819 --> 04:02.886
- Yeah.
- How long you been...?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.688
For 31/2, like 4 months.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.523
- So you're talking probably...
- The honeymoon's over.

04:07.558 --> 04:09.692
The luster's
a little bit dingy.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.628
- The what?
- Take the good and the... sure!

04:11.662 --> 04:13.730
Dude, four months
isn't that long.

04:13.764 --> 04:16.899
My wife, she doesn't
know anything about comics.

04:16.934 --> 04:19.168
And she was faced with this
when we were starting out.

04:19.202 --> 04:20.803
You know, they just
kind treat her here like,

04:20.838 --> 04:22.405
"here, buy
the most expensive thing."

04:22.440 --> 04:24.006
Luckily I like
the most expensive thing

04:24.041 --> 04:25.007
and we got married.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.375
Right.

04:26.410 --> 04:29.378
- But it really does take,
like, a little bit of, um...

04:29.413 --> 04:31.247
- you're not there
to just crassly take their money

04:31.281 --> 04:32.481
and be, like,
"take this."

04:32.515 --> 04:34.683
- No, because,
you know, the wrong gift...

04:34.717 --> 04:35.684
that could end a relationship.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.419
- It could damn a relationship.
- Yeah.

04:37.453 --> 04:38.888
You really gotta
get to know them,

04:38.922 --> 04:40.690
what is their interest,
what are they into?

04:40.724 --> 04:42.325
Hang out with them
for a few days.

04:42.359 --> 04:45.095
Yeah, how deep
are you getting into this, man?

04:45.130 --> 04:48.265
It's, like, an episode
of <i>hart to hart,</i> man.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.034
This is all
about romance, right?

04:50.068 --> 04:51.836
Yeah.
Oh, definitely.

04:51.870 --> 04:53.571
- Well, we have the most
romantic <i>spider-man</i> story

04:53.605 --> 04:54.673
ever written.

04:54.707 --> 04:56.774
I like the idea
of classic romance.

04:56.809 --> 04:58.209
I'm into that.
Come back this way.

04:58.243 --> 05:00.878
Right here are the two issues
I was speaking of.

05:00.912 --> 05:03.481
<i>Spider-man</i> 121 and 122.

05:10.455 --> 05:12.656
Ah, so the death
of Gwen Stacy.

05:12.690 --> 05:14.424
And the death
of green goblin.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.460
Spider-man's girlfriend
is thrown off a bridge

05:17.494 --> 05:18.828
by the green goblin.

05:18.863 --> 05:22.165
Spider-man shoots a web down,
snags her by the back

05:22.199 --> 05:24.701
and in doing so,
her neck snaps...

05:24.736 --> 05:26.170
- oh, brutal.
- And she dies.

05:26.204 --> 05:28.839
- So the next issue,
spider-man took a vow, like,

05:28.874 --> 05:31.609
"you son-of-a-bitch,
you killed my woman.

05:31.643 --> 05:32.744
Tonight you're gonna pay."

05:32.778 --> 05:34.813
But when he was ready
for the death blow

05:34.847 --> 05:36.948
against the green goblin,
he turned his back.

05:36.982 --> 05:39.517
He realized that killing
was not the answer.

05:39.552 --> 05:42.554
You know, the ultimate in,
you know, true heroism.

05:42.588 --> 05:44.022
I read that book
off the stands,

05:44.056 --> 05:46.057
and it had a huge impact on me.

05:46.092 --> 05:48.393
So you consider
the second part of it

05:48.427 --> 05:51.229
as poignant because
he lives up to the vow

05:51.263 --> 05:53.430
he made to the woman he failed.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.200
In the first issue.

05:56.234 --> 05:57.635
I know it's a little late.

05:57.669 --> 06:01.139
Yeah, like, "sorry I'm late!
You will be avenged!"

06:02.675 --> 06:04.276
That's true romance
right there.

06:04.310 --> 06:05.410
Take these up to the front,

06:05.444 --> 06:06.411
you can take
a closer look at them then.

06:06.446 --> 06:07.446
All right, cool.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.781
We did good.
Ooh, awesome.

06:09.816 --> 06:11.450
These are
two really good books.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.418
What are we asking
for them again?

06:13.452 --> 06:15.487
- This one was $95.
- Yeah.

06:15.521 --> 06:16.588
- And...
- Whoo!

06:16.623 --> 06:17.623
Well, that's
the death of Gwen.

06:17.657 --> 06:18.958
- Yeah.
- This is...

06:18.992 --> 06:20.259
- okay, so that's, like,
a really monumental event.

06:20.293 --> 06:21.293
- Yeah.
- Right.

06:21.328 --> 06:22.662
- It's huge.
- Okay.

06:22.696 --> 06:25.431
And this one was $75.
So $170.

06:25.465 --> 06:28.501
I was looking at $100.

06:28.536 --> 06:30.603
Budget-wise, so...

06:30.638 --> 06:33.974
He's not worth that much
is what she's saying.

06:35.610 --> 06:37.978
Uh, $160?

06:38.012 --> 06:40.714
Mike, I think
I can do better than $160.

06:40.749 --> 06:43.117
I think it's possible today...

06:43.151 --> 06:46.220
just today... if this was any
other day it wouldn't happen.

06:46.254 --> 06:48.656
But I think we can do $150.

06:50.492 --> 06:52.459
It's a little over my budget

06:52.494 --> 06:54.194
but I think
that the complete set

06:54.229 --> 06:56.430
is really a solid, nice gift.

06:56.464 --> 06:57.464
I agree.

06:57.499 --> 06:58.565
It shows
I put the research in

06:58.600 --> 07:01.435
and I cared enough,
so...Yeah.

07:01.469 --> 07:03.637
I'll bag 'em up.

07:03.671 --> 07:05.139
- Thanks.
- $150, please.

07:05.173 --> 07:08.175
All right.

07:16.985 --> 07:18.119
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

07:18.153 --> 07:19.320
How you doin'?

07:19.354 --> 07:20.788
I didn't know
they came out with that.

07:20.822 --> 07:22.323
- Yeah, they re-released it
in hardcover.

07:22.357 --> 07:23.858
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tim.

07:23.892 --> 07:25.026
Hey, what's up, Mike.
How you doin'?

07:25.060 --> 07:26.861
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

07:26.895 --> 07:28.562
- 23.
- All right.

07:28.597 --> 07:30.431
Looks like you got...
A new tat?

07:30.465 --> 07:31.832
Uh, well this one.

07:31.866 --> 07:34.134
It's my wife's name.
It was the last one I got.

07:34.169 --> 07:35.803
Which one's your favorite?

07:35.837 --> 07:38.205
- Um, I like the octopus a lot.
- Was it painful?

07:38.239 --> 07:39.674
Yeah.
Yeah, it's real painful.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.910
I mean, it's, like,
somebody's holding a giant bee

07:41.944 --> 07:44.980
and just being attacked by it
for a couple hours.

07:45.014 --> 07:47.249
But those tats though,
the tough guy meter

07:47.283 --> 07:50.386
is, uh, off the charts when
you see somebody walk in with...

07:50.421 --> 07:52.022
like, you're, like,
you show more respect

07:52.056 --> 07:53.056
to a guy with tats.

07:53.091 --> 07:54.692
They're really cool.

07:54.726 --> 07:55.960
I'm pretty impressed.
You guys have any?

07:55.994 --> 07:57.228
I have none.

07:57.262 --> 07:58.596
Not me, man.

07:58.630 --> 08:01.432
I believe, like,
when a guy is inked,

08:01.466 --> 08:02.600
you know, properly...

08:02.634 --> 08:03.868
- right.

08:03.902 --> 08:05.403
Like, it just screams...

08:05.438 --> 08:07.139
"Don't eff with me."
Right.

08:07.173 --> 08:08.673
- "I'm a bad-ass.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.974
I'm a bad man."

08:10.009 --> 08:11.309
"Look what I'm willing
to do to me!

08:11.344 --> 08:13.311
What do you think
I'm willing to do to you!"

08:13.345 --> 08:14.445
Exactly!

08:14.480 --> 08:16.247
- I kinda like that...
"I'm a bad man."

08:17.683 --> 08:19.417
- All right, man.
- All right, thanks a lot.

08:19.451 --> 08:20.452
- Take it easy.
- See you guys later.

08:20.486 --> 08:22.788
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

08:22.822 --> 08:25.090
I was wondering,
like, would I be that bad-ass

08:25.125 --> 08:27.493
or would I just look like a fool
if I had tats like that?

08:27.527 --> 08:28.794
- No, I think
you'd look bad-ass.

08:28.829 --> 08:30.864
Like, if your arms are covered
as much as his were.

08:30.898 --> 08:33.166
- Dude, with all your praise
of his tattoos...

08:33.201 --> 08:35.135
like, the one chance
you had, you bailed.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.570
What?
When was that?

08:36.604 --> 08:38.639
- '95.
- Ooh.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.474
Let's check
these stock orders real quick.

08:40.508 --> 08:41.808
Yeah, that can wait.

08:41.842 --> 08:43.243
Wait, keep going.
He promised.

08:43.278 --> 08:47.748
He said... I remember,
so steadfast, so vehemently,

08:47.782 --> 08:50.684
"if the devils
win the cup this year

08:50.719 --> 08:52.653
I'm getting
a devils tattoo."

08:52.688 --> 08:54.755
I remember when they won,
I asked him

08:54.790 --> 08:55.990
if he was gonna get it
and he's, like, "nah."

08:56.024 --> 08:57.224
And I said,
"what the hell?"

08:57.259 --> 08:58.426
Like, "why would you
chicken out?"

08:58.460 --> 08:59.661
And he said...
- I didn't chicken out.

08:59.695 --> 09:01.062
- You did chicken out.
- I didn't chicken out.

09:01.096 --> 09:02.864
- Bak-bak-bak-bak!
- I did not chicken out!

09:02.899 --> 09:04.967
I just changed my mind!

09:05.001 --> 09:07.703
Somebody else changed his mind.

09:07.738 --> 09:09.238
His wife bought him
a video game

09:09.273 --> 09:10.540
if he wouldn't get the tattoo.

09:11.742 --> 09:14.177
- No, no.
- That's what you told me.

09:14.211 --> 09:16.179
It was a video game system!

09:18.015 --> 09:19.315
Now I remember this.

09:19.349 --> 09:20.683
Yes, yes.

09:20.717 --> 09:22.685
Do you ever regret
not getting the tattoo?

09:22.719 --> 09:24.153
I just don't think
I carry a tattoo.

09:24.187 --> 09:27.689
I just don't project
what a hard-ass projects

09:27.724 --> 09:29.391
when they got tattoos,
you know?

09:29.425 --> 09:30.825
What if you got one
right on your forehead,

09:30.860 --> 09:32.660
just said "killer."

09:32.695 --> 09:33.895
Um...

09:33.929 --> 09:35.296
"I heart comics."

09:36.632 --> 09:37.900
That's even cooler.

09:37.934 --> 09:39.869
How could you back down
like that, though?

09:39.903 --> 09:41.537
The devils won the cup.

09:41.571 --> 09:43.973
You know I hate to side
with ming on anything.

09:44.008 --> 09:45.341
But on this one...
- What's that sound?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.343
It sounds like a bird
with no tattoos.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.813
If I really wanted one,

09:49.847 --> 09:50.980
I wouldn't have to
run it by my wife.

09:51.015 --> 09:52.315
- Oh.
- That's for sure.

09:52.349 --> 09:53.316
Okay.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.151
How about
we all get tattoos then?

09:55.186 --> 09:56.720
Let's put our money
where our mouth is.

09:56.754 --> 09:58.522
- You're gonna get a tattoo?
- I will get a tattoo.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.190
We all get tattoos.
I will get a tattoo.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.824
All right,
if you get one, I'll get one.

10:01.858 --> 10:03.559
- You're really gonna get one?
- What does that mean?

10:03.594 --> 10:06.195
Like, you think I'm not?
I don't know, are you?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.797
Did I say I was?

10:07.832 --> 10:09.098
You get one, you get one,

10:09.133 --> 10:10.299
I'll get one.

10:10.334 --> 10:11.401
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.802
All right.

10:12.837 --> 10:13.903
While we're all there
you might as well grab one too

10:13.938 --> 10:15.304
while you're at it.
I'll go.

10:15.339 --> 10:16.739
I don't have a wife
to check with.

10:16.773 --> 10:18.674
Must be nice.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.910
I'm sure your wife
will appreciate hearing that.

10:24.714 --> 10:26.048
- You into green lantern?
- Yes.

10:26.082 --> 10:28.550
And this is actually
the movie, uh, paraphernalia.

10:28.584 --> 10:29.718
How much you looking for?

10:29.752 --> 10:32.454
Probably be looking at, uh...

10:44.914 --> 10:46.882
You would never box
a woman celebrity?

10:46.917 --> 10:48.050
Even for charity?
Nope.

10:48.084 --> 10:49.919
What if she was, like,
in the press constantly?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.254
Like, "come on, Flanagan!
Come on, Flanagan!"

10:52.288 --> 10:54.924
There's nothing to gain.
If I lose, I look foolish.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.426
If I win, I look horrific.
- It's a no-win situation.

10:57.461 --> 10:59.862
Yeah...Okay,
I should box you then.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.029
All right.

11:01.064 --> 11:02.398
I'd box you and jet li
at the same time.

11:02.432 --> 11:03.599
- I don't...
I don't need jet li.

11:03.633 --> 11:04.633
You're gonna beat me
in a boxing match?

11:04.668 --> 11:06.268
- Yeah.
- You're crazy.

11:06.302 --> 11:08.103
- I think he could beat you.
- He definitely could.

11:09.505 --> 11:10.905
Oh, do you think he'd
run around enough to wind you.

11:10.939 --> 11:12.273
- Mm-hm.

11:12.307 --> 11:13.674
And then you wouldn't be able
to keep your arms up?

11:13.709 --> 11:15.376
Oh, I get out of breath,
like, eating lunch.

11:15.411 --> 11:16.444
Yeah.

11:16.478 --> 11:17.478
He'll destroy me
in two seconds.

11:17.513 --> 11:18.780
- It's all over.
- You know what?

11:18.814 --> 11:20.315
I would cut all this off
so I just had, like,

11:20.349 --> 11:21.316
the moustache.

11:21.350 --> 11:22.750
- The handlebar?
- Yeah, mm-hm.

11:22.785 --> 11:24.552
- How you doing?
- Hey, how you doin'?

11:24.586 --> 11:26.621
I'd be, like, knocking stuff
out of people's hands.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.056
Hey, real quick,
before you get to that.

11:28.090 --> 11:30.092
Who do you think would win
in a fight, me or him?

11:30.126 --> 11:31.259
I'm gonna go with Asian,
'cause I gotta support

11:31.294 --> 11:32.494
the brothers.

11:32.528 --> 11:33.828
- All right, yes.
- I gotta support the brothers.

11:33.863 --> 11:35.363
- I love it.
- You're both racist.

11:35.398 --> 11:37.765
You guys wanna actually
talk about business?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.200
Or now, or..?
Yeah, that's a good idea.

11:39.235 --> 11:40.668
All right.
You into green lantern?

11:40.702 --> 11:41.902
Yes.

11:41.936 --> 11:43.638
This is actually
the movie, uh, paraphernalia.

11:50.011 --> 11:51.544
This is something
I picked up years back.

11:51.579 --> 11:53.379
Probably in the mid-90s.

11:53.414 --> 11:57.317
The front areas
are actually the fragile parts.

11:57.352 --> 11:58.418
And it lights.

11:58.453 --> 11:59.686
You know what
green lantern was, right?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.154
He had a little ring.
Yes.

12:01.189 --> 12:02.489
- He had a little ring
and he power-charged

12:02.524 --> 12:04.391
into this battery
and he'd go fight crime.

12:04.426 --> 12:05.526
So what does he do?

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
Green lantern flies around
holding this,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.028
looking for bad guys and stuff?

12:08.063 --> 12:09.163
No, that power battery

12:09.197 --> 12:10.665
is actually just
what he charges up the ring at.

12:10.699 --> 12:12.467
The ring
is the real weapon and...

12:12.501 --> 12:14.302
- he has to charge his ring?
- Yeah.

12:14.337 --> 12:15.737
- That is... how inconvenient.

12:15.772 --> 12:17.406
- The power ring...
the Owen power ring.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.707
Yeah.

12:18.741 --> 12:20.809
We live in a world now
where we charge everything.

12:20.843 --> 12:22.410
- Yeah.
- Why is that...?

12:22.445 --> 12:24.679
We're actually very programmed
to be green lantern now.

12:24.713 --> 12:25.813
Sometimes you forget, though.

12:25.847 --> 12:27.681
Like, sometimes I forget
to charge my cell phone.

12:27.715 --> 12:29.083
You just do it
before you go to bed.

12:29.117 --> 12:31.151
How long
does it take to charge?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.385
- As long as that poem?
- As long as the poem?

12:32.420 --> 12:33.553
I think it's
as long as the oath

12:33.587 --> 12:34.654
and what is it?

12:34.688 --> 12:35.688
"In brightest day
and blackest night,

12:35.723 --> 12:37.657
"no evil shall escape my sight.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.359
Let those who... "

12:39.393 --> 12:41.195
ah, it's too much.
It's too much.

12:42.363 --> 12:43.697
12 seconds
is really too long to wait

12:43.731 --> 12:45.666
to be, like, all-powerful?

12:45.700 --> 12:47.501
Ming is about
to get his head ripped off

12:47.536 --> 12:48.903
by a super-villain, right?

12:48.937 --> 12:52.007
Okay...

12:52.041 --> 12:54.310
We're going...

12:54.344 --> 12:55.544
Five seconds, ming.

12:55.579 --> 12:56.745
You got another
seven seconds left.

12:56.780 --> 12:57.980
I love that,
you think that's too long.

12:58.014 --> 12:59.548
We're still going.

12:59.583 --> 13:00.783
- Yeah, but every superhero...
- We're still going.

13:00.817 --> 13:02.051
Every superhero
has limitations.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.219
- We're still going...
I'm green lantern!

13:03.253 --> 13:04.653
Oh, there, he's done.

13:04.688 --> 13:06.555
How much you looking for
for the prop?

13:06.589 --> 13:09.224
This, uh, was one
of the limited releases

13:09.258 --> 13:11.526
that came out in 2006.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.063
Probably be looking at, uh...

13:15.097 --> 13:17.932
About 280 on it.

13:17.966 --> 13:19.667
It doesn't go for that much.

13:19.701 --> 13:22.170
In truth I did,
uh, see recently on Ebay

13:22.204 --> 13:24.072
someone did win one,
I think unboxed for

13:24.106 --> 13:25.906
plus $250 range.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.575
- At the highest end that
I've seen these at right now...

13:28.610 --> 13:30.243
I mean...
- Say it!

13:30.278 --> 13:32.646
- $87, $88.
- Okay it goes both ways.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.316
I mean, you're not wrong
that it can go for that, so...

13:36.350 --> 13:40.220
Probably couldn't
go over 60 bucks for this.

13:40.255 --> 13:41.788
Okay, I'll have to decline.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.123
But, you know,
thanks for taking the time.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.891
- Sorry, man.
- No problem.

13:44.926 --> 13:48.061
Thanks, fellas.
See you later, man.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.463
I'm sick of people coming in
and thinking that they can get

13:50.497 --> 13:52.364
what they see online for.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.932
I thought you'd
be used to that by now.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.501
You know what,
you're the hot woman

13:55.535 --> 13:57.370
at the bar that's
just constantly getting hit on.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.839
Bad lines, you know,
people buying you drinks

13:59.873 --> 14:01.441
then thinking
they can take you home.

14:01.475 --> 14:04.177
Thank God for people like you.
The hot women like you.

14:13.423 --> 14:14.556
All right, guys.

14:14.591 --> 14:16.992
I wanna see what
the tattoo designs look like.

14:17.026 --> 14:18.827
I wanna see what you guys
are gonna get.

14:18.861 --> 14:20.262
Where you're gonna get them.

14:20.296 --> 14:21.496
What you guys
are thinking about.

14:21.531 --> 14:24.199
I'm going with a bad-ass...

14:24.233 --> 14:25.767
Super-satanic...

14:25.801 --> 14:27.268
Demon-head.

14:27.302 --> 14:29.970
With his tongue hanging out,
holding a Stanley cup.

14:30.005 --> 14:31.505
Totally, like, satanic.

14:31.539 --> 14:32.506
Like, people
are gonna be, like,

14:32.540 --> 14:35.408
that guy dabbles
in the black magic.

14:35.443 --> 14:36.710
- That's pretty bad-ass.

14:36.744 --> 14:37.744
What are you gonna do, ming?

14:37.778 --> 14:39.112
I always wanted
the Jack knight

14:39.147 --> 14:40.547
"Starman" symbol.

14:40.581 --> 14:42.749
What about something satanic?

14:42.784 --> 14:45.118
- I'm not...
- Yeah, is there a devil by it?

14:45.153 --> 14:46.320
I'm nowhere near satanic.

14:46.354 --> 14:47.621
- Come on, you wanna
look bad-ass, don't you?

14:47.655 --> 14:50.057
You don't wanna
look like just a comic nerd.

14:50.091 --> 14:51.425
- That is bad-ass.

14:51.459 --> 14:52.793
I'm gonna stop short
of agreeing with you there.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.262
Well, you're gonna
love the next one then.

14:54.296 --> 14:56.664
I always thought about getting
the Baltimore orioles mascot.

14:56.698 --> 14:58.432
Remember back in '83,
the cartoon bird?

14:58.466 --> 15:00.401
Why not get something
that's really, like,

15:00.435 --> 15:03.603
personal to you,
like the stash logo.

15:03.638 --> 15:05.605
That's a huge commitment.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.773
Um, you know, I love it here.

15:06.808 --> 15:08.542
I don't plan on
being here forever though.

15:08.576 --> 15:09.910
- What?
- Whoa!

15:09.944 --> 15:10.944
It sounds like
he's giving notice.

15:10.979 --> 15:12.279
I'm not giving notice.

15:12.313 --> 15:13.580
Five years from now,
you don't plan to be here?

15:13.615 --> 15:15.315
Walt, do you mind
if I email you my resume?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.784
I got one other tattoo idea,

15:17.818 --> 15:20.219
it's a Chinese family seal.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.223
Looks like something
out of a fortune cookie.

15:22.256 --> 15:24.891
So what,
it's a crest? A seal?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.859
It's the Chen family seal.
It says "Chen" on there.

15:26.894 --> 15:28.327
What do they use it for?

15:28.362 --> 15:30.296
It's an ancient way of,
like, signing your documents.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.064
Like, that's your official seal.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.065
- This is pretty cool.
- You approve of it?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.233
I approve of this.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.701
I don't consider myself
a tat person

15:35.735 --> 15:37.370
by any stretch
of the imagination.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.139
But I got my wife's name
when I was younger, man.

15:40.174 --> 15:41.140
It says "Jenny's."

15:41.175 --> 15:42.375
And I always figured
if she dumped me

15:42.409 --> 15:44.377
I'd just turn
the "j" into a "d."

15:44.411 --> 15:46.479
And people would be,
like, "I can see that."

15:46.514 --> 15:48.081
"He's down
with the super bird."

15:48.116 --> 15:50.284
"He likes
moons over my hammy."

15:53.288 --> 15:55.123
All right, so what
are you getting Mike?

15:55.157 --> 15:56.590
What are you
thinking about getting?

15:56.625 --> 16:00.161
I'm toying with the idea
of a superhero logo.

16:00.195 --> 16:01.562
And I see names around them.

16:01.596 --> 16:03.130
Yeah, my wife.

16:03.164 --> 16:04.465
Where are you gonna get it?

16:04.499 --> 16:08.335
Either down here
on my rump, right here.

16:08.369 --> 16:11.237
Or on my arm.
Like a tramp stamp?

16:11.272 --> 16:12.739
No!

16:12.773 --> 16:15.274
No, not center, over here.

16:15.309 --> 16:16.576
That's pretty close, man.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.178
That's too close for comfort,
isn't it?

16:18.212 --> 16:19.513
Not too many people
are gonna see it.

16:19.547 --> 16:20.581
What about when
you're bending over,

16:20.615 --> 16:23.150
like, helping somebody
grab a comic?

16:23.185 --> 16:24.652
The shirt might pull up.

16:24.686 --> 16:27.121
Before they would only have
noticed your thong, but now...

16:28.257 --> 16:30.959
Now they notice
the tramp-stamp as well.

16:30.993 --> 16:33.028
You wanna talk about manly?

16:34.196 --> 16:35.364
Tell them the first tattoo
you got.

16:35.398 --> 16:37.366
Well, the first one
I ever got was, uh...

16:37.400 --> 16:39.334
Calvin and Hobbes.

16:39.368 --> 16:40.802
Again, sorry,
we didn't quite hear that.

16:40.836 --> 16:42.070
Yeah, slowly, slowly.

16:42.104 --> 16:44.439
Calvin and Hobbes,
the bill watterson cartoon.

16:44.473 --> 16:45.973
- So in order to show
what a bad-ass you were,

16:46.007 --> 16:47.108
like, "look at this kid!"

16:47.142 --> 16:49.610
He's got
an imaginary friend!"

16:53.580 --> 16:55.615
Um, all right,
so this dude's talking about

16:55.649 --> 16:56.916
putting a scene
out of <i>the exorcist.</i>

16:56.950 --> 16:58.451
- Right.
- You've got Calvin and Hobbes.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.952
What are you gonna add to it?

16:59.987 --> 17:02.188
I'm going for a tattoo
of my niece.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
I'm swept up in the zombie fever
just like everybody else

17:04.657 --> 17:07.527
so it's gonna be
a picture of her as a zombie.

17:07.561 --> 17:10.564
Riding her tricycle.

17:14.769 --> 17:16.469
You're not serious, right?

17:16.503 --> 17:18.637
Yeah, no, she loves zombies.

17:18.672 --> 17:20.306
I love zombies,
she loves zombies,

17:20.339 --> 17:22.308
we love zombies together.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.242
That's what we bond over.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.944
Ooh, that
is a tough one though,

17:25.979 --> 17:29.448
because it's, like, on one hand
you're, like, "it's my niece."

17:29.482 --> 17:30.616
- Mm-hm.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.916
Then on the other hand
you have to explain,

17:31.951 --> 17:33.985
"it's my niece, dead."

17:34.020 --> 17:35.186
Well...

17:35.221 --> 17:36.654
Living dead.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.758
- Where's it going?
- Right here.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.192
I'm gonna do it right here.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.129
- Can I be 100% honest with you?
- Are you ever anything less?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.532
Worst, worst idea
I've ever heard

17:46.566 --> 17:48.067
come out of your mouth.
Really?

17:48.101 --> 17:51.003
- It's so... it's such
in poor taste, man.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.040
It's, like, bad taste
to the tenth degree.

17:54.075 --> 17:55.075
To whom, though?

17:55.109 --> 17:59.078
To get a dead child
put on your arm.

17:59.113 --> 18:00.446
There's no coming back
from that, man.

18:00.481 --> 18:01.614
When you put it like that,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.115
it actually sounds
even more metal.

18:05.386 --> 18:07.120
Why are you
selling these Barbies?

18:07.154 --> 18:09.989
It's hard because, you know,
I've had them for so long.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.857
So is it a done deal?

18:11.891 --> 18:14.626
Um...Mmm...

18:19.848 --> 18:21.716
How come you don't sell
whoopee cushions in this store?

18:21.750 --> 18:23.618
It's not a novelty store.

18:23.652 --> 18:25.853
You don't think they provide
the same degree of hilarity

18:25.888 --> 18:28.589
and enjoyment
that they did 40 years ago?

18:28.623 --> 18:29.957
I mean, how much money
can you really make?

18:29.991 --> 18:31.992
How many whoopee cushions
you think you could really sell?

18:32.027 --> 18:35.095
- And therefore sell-out
the integrity of the store?

18:35.130 --> 18:36.563
I'm not worried
about integrity.

18:36.598 --> 18:37.931
If I thought I could
bring us in some money,

18:37.966 --> 18:38.999
I'd stock it.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.801
It would be only
whoopee cushions.

18:40.835 --> 18:43.704
You know, like,
if it was, like, pokemon '98.

18:43.738 --> 18:45.973
- Yeah.
- Whoopee cushions, 2011.

18:47.075 --> 18:48.775
I would have
no problem doing that.

18:48.809 --> 18:49.809
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

18:49.844 --> 18:51.177
- Good, how are you?
- All right.

18:51.212 --> 18:52.579
Um, well, I have
a couple things that I think

18:52.613 --> 18:54.814
maybe you might
be interested in.

18:54.848 --> 18:55.882
Sure.

18:55.916 --> 18:57.083
If you wanna
take a look at them.

18:57.117 --> 19:00.153
- I'll take a look at them.
- Okay!

19:00.188 --> 19:01.254
Hmm.

19:01.289 --> 19:02.923
- Barbies.
- Wonder-Barbies.

19:02.957 --> 19:04.891
All my superhero Barbies.

19:11.898 --> 19:13.999
- Batgirl.
- Oh, wow, Barbies.

19:14.034 --> 19:15.033
With lunchboxes.

19:15.068 --> 19:16.468
So all you have is Barbies?

19:16.502 --> 19:18.503
Yeah, that's all I've got.

19:18.537 --> 19:20.004
Why are you
selling these Barbies?

19:20.039 --> 19:23.340
- I have too much stuff.
- Too much stuff?

19:23.375 --> 19:26.410
I'm trying to minimize it
so I can buy more...

19:26.444 --> 19:27.844
More stuff.

19:27.879 --> 19:32.448
So yeah, unfortunately Barbies
and, uh, the secret stash

19:32.483 --> 19:36.286
are not... we're not...

19:36.320 --> 19:38.655
"A-Ken" to Barbie, get it?
- Mm-hm.

19:39.990 --> 19:41.458
Yeah, clever.

19:41.492 --> 19:44.094
You two should
be paying for that.

19:44.128 --> 19:46.130
I won't carry Barbies
in the stash.

19:46.164 --> 19:47.598
Neanderthal.

19:47.632 --> 19:48.899
Why, why?

19:48.934 --> 19:50.301
Because Barbies
don't belong in the stash.

19:50.335 --> 19:52.770
Girl toy!
Boy toys!

19:54.072 --> 19:55.473
- I just don't
feel it belongs...

19:55.507 --> 19:56.908
- but if she's dressed
like batgirl,

19:56.942 --> 19:58.343
then she belongs in the stash.

19:58.377 --> 19:59.578
It's such a reach.

19:59.612 --> 20:00.646
But if she's dressed
like a superhero,

20:00.680 --> 20:02.448
she earns a place
at the table, no?

20:02.482 --> 20:04.116
Underneath you're still
a Barbie.

20:04.151 --> 20:05.518
Ooh.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.053
That hurts, that's gotta hurt.
Barbie rolls a tear.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.989
I think that's so weird
that you're, like,

20:11.023 --> 20:14.593
"Barbie doesn't cross the...
she shall not pass!"

20:15.694 --> 20:17.428
Stop Barbie at the door.

20:17.462 --> 20:19.563
What about Ken
dressed as han solo?

20:19.598 --> 20:21.565
It's still a Ken doll.

20:21.599 --> 20:24.634
What about Ken
dressed as a G.I. Robot?

20:24.669 --> 20:27.237
Like, they go real obscure
into D.C. history?

20:27.271 --> 20:28.839
- It's still a robot.
- Really?

20:28.873 --> 20:30.274
- I mean, it's still...
- G.I. Robot Ken?

20:30.308 --> 20:32.877
You wouldn't be, like,
"all right, man, they tried."

20:32.911 --> 20:34.379
What if it was
kryptonite Ken?

20:34.413 --> 20:36.715
A Ken made entirely
of kryptonite?

20:36.749 --> 20:39.117
- I might buy that.
- A-ha!

20:39.152 --> 20:40.585
What are you looking for?

20:40.620 --> 20:43.889
I don't wanna lead them on
that I might even be interested.

20:43.923 --> 20:46.058
- How much are you looking for?
- On the sly.

20:47.393 --> 20:51.396
Well, um, what I was
looking for, um, online.

20:51.431 --> 20:54.532
They were, like, $40 a piece
or they had three of them

20:54.567 --> 20:56.534
for, like, $75.

20:56.568 --> 21:01.071
I mean, to me, these are worth
way more than $40 a piece.

21:01.105 --> 21:03.707
Just because it's, you know,
it's something that I...

21:03.741 --> 21:05.875
- your nostalgic feelings
from childhood.

21:05.910 --> 21:06.910
Yeah.

21:06.944 --> 21:08.211
- Is what...
what gets the market.

21:08.245 --> 21:09.680
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, I see.

21:09.714 --> 21:12.783
- But yeah, they were about...
they were running around, um...

21:12.817 --> 21:14.051
what about...
would you break 'em up?

21:14.085 --> 21:16.453
If I were to take two
off your hands?

21:16.487 --> 21:17.955
What are you gonna do
with two Barbies?

21:17.989 --> 21:19.823
- I have a five-year-old niece
and she's into dolls and stuff.

21:19.858 --> 21:21.658
- Is she into wonder woman?
- Superheroes.

21:21.693 --> 21:22.693
She might be.

21:22.727 --> 21:24.127
You mentioned
a price of $40 earlier.

21:24.162 --> 21:25.596
Yes.

21:25.630 --> 21:27.498
So what would you, uh...?

21:27.532 --> 21:28.932
Um...

21:28.967 --> 21:30.767
Mm...

21:30.802 --> 21:32.402
Come on, girl,
I can make it real easy.

21:32.436 --> 21:34.104
- Yes.
- $25 each.

21:34.138 --> 21:35.205
$25 each.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.540
As I crack my knuckles.

21:37.575 --> 21:38.875
That way you don't have to
sell them online.

21:38.909 --> 21:40.309
You don't have to pack them up.

21:40.344 --> 21:41.477
You don't have to have somebody
turn around and be, like,

21:41.511 --> 21:42.945
"oh, I never got them!"

21:42.979 --> 21:45.447
Yeah, it's hard because
I've had them for so long

21:45.481 --> 21:46.615
and it's just, like...

21:46.649 --> 21:47.683
- how long could
you have had these?

21:47.717 --> 21:48.884
Yeah, what year
did they come out?

21:48.919 --> 21:51.387
- They just came out probably.
- What? 2003.

21:51.422 --> 21:52.422
Oh, my goodness.

21:52.456 --> 21:53.623
That's almost
ten years, people.

21:53.657 --> 21:55.024
You've had these
for almost ten years.

21:55.059 --> 21:56.359
She's very
emotionally attached.

21:56.393 --> 21:57.761
The attachment.

21:57.795 --> 21:59.796
I get attached to something
that I buy, like, this year.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.497
Hold on a second,
I'll show you a picture

22:01.532 --> 22:02.866
of the little kid it's going to

22:02.900 --> 22:04.434
and then you tell me
if 25 is too much.

22:04.469 --> 22:05.435
It'll be out of the box.

22:05.470 --> 22:06.970
There she is.
You wanna tell her?

22:07.005 --> 22:08.438
- Aw!
- Ooh!

22:08.473 --> 22:10.173
- You gonna tell her?
- No, mm-mm.

22:12.176 --> 22:13.410
So is it a done deal?

22:13.444 --> 22:16.847
The two...For $50?

22:19.384 --> 22:21.685
- Yes, yes.
- All right.

22:21.719 --> 22:23.019
- Yes.
- I'm so proud of you.

22:25.222 --> 22:26.656
I'm a master negotiator,
and they should have me

22:26.691 --> 22:27.857
behind that counter.

22:27.892 --> 22:29.693
Okay, so they
were going for $40,

22:29.727 --> 22:30.861
and you got them down to $25?

22:30.895 --> 22:32.530
- 25 a piece.
- Not bad, man.

22:32.564 --> 22:33.731
So you went
from 80 to 50 bucks.

22:33.765 --> 22:35.299
- Mm-hm.
- Master negotiator.

22:35.334 --> 22:36.734
- Yup.
- Yeah.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.136
They're probably cackling
'cause they just came

22:38.170 --> 22:40.071
from the store where they
bought them two for ten bucks.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.175
I think I ripped him off.

22:44.209 --> 22:45.477
We got this pigeon.

22:45.511 --> 22:46.979
Get them out of here
before a customer shows up.

22:47.013 --> 22:48.447
Is it all right
if I sell them?

22:48.481 --> 22:49.515
Like, if somebody
offers me something

22:49.549 --> 22:51.317
while I'm walking around?

22:51.351 --> 22:54.119
Dude, it's not gonna happen.

22:56.190 --> 22:57.790
- You really gonna do this?
- Of course.

22:57.825 --> 22:59.125
Were there
any last minute pleading

22:59.159 --> 23:00.226
from any of your wives?

23:00.260 --> 23:01.293
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

23:01.328 --> 23:02.595
- Yeah.
- What'd she say?

23:02.629 --> 23:03.963
If you're really
gonna do this,

23:03.997 --> 23:06.765
let me get a look at you,
you know, perfect before, uh...

23:06.800 --> 23:08.934
Pfft, perfect!

23:08.968 --> 23:10.402
Look, your feet
don't even hit the floor.

23:10.437 --> 23:11.436
Oh.

23:11.471 --> 23:12.571
He looks like lily tomlin

23:12.605 --> 23:13.906
when she used to sit
in that giant chair.

23:18.511 --> 23:22.381
So we're just waiting
for Walt, huh?

23:22.415 --> 23:24.116
I don't think he's coming.

23:24.150 --> 23:25.284
You gotta be kidding me.

23:25.318 --> 23:26.986
Who needs him?
Who needs Flanagan?

23:27.020 --> 23:28.988
- It's unbelievable, man.
- Are you gonna back out?

23:29.022 --> 23:32.391
We got a little brotherly
triangle going on right here.

23:32.426 --> 23:34.227
He was part of the reason
I was gonna do it, though.

23:34.262 --> 23:35.461
Put it in his face.

23:35.496 --> 23:37.797
Any time he starts
giving you crap about anything...

23:37.832 --> 23:38.799
pfft!

23:38.833 --> 23:40.633
"Remember that?"
He shuts up.

23:40.668 --> 23:42.001
"You shut up, Flanagan."

23:42.036 --> 23:43.837
This is something
that you can hang over him.

23:43.871 --> 23:44.871
Yeah.

23:44.905 --> 23:46.439
Forever, permanently.

23:46.473 --> 23:48.341
Exactly.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.410
Just for that
it'll be worth it.

23:50.444 --> 23:51.477
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

23:51.512 --> 23:52.845
- Let's rock.
- All right.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.248
After you.

23:57.450 --> 24:00.018
That slide in...
That's intimidating.

24:00.053 --> 24:02.154
Was that some sort of,
like, Alpha dog move?

24:02.188 --> 24:04.189
In <i>my</i> store?

24:12.135 --> 24:13.335
- What's up, guys?
- How's it going?

24:13.370 --> 24:14.803
- What's goin' on?
- How you doin'?

24:14.838 --> 24:16.005
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing much, man.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.673
I, uh... you know,
I've walked here a few times.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.208
I saw you walking
back and forth out there.

24:19.242 --> 24:20.409
- Yeah.
- I was about to call the cops.

24:22.412 --> 24:24.614
I've got a couple of things
that I think you guys

24:24.648 --> 24:26.182
might be interested in.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.750
I've just got some figures.
Ooh!

24:27.784 --> 24:28.918
- Batman.
- Yeah.

24:28.952 --> 24:31.154
- Hm.
- The target exclusives, huh?

24:31.188 --> 24:32.188
Yeah.

24:39.163 --> 24:41.164
What do these remind you of?

24:41.198 --> 24:42.331
Oh, Mego's.

24:42.366 --> 24:45.167
The legendary Mego line
of the '70s.

24:45.202 --> 24:46.869
About ten years ago

24:46.903 --> 24:48.604
all the chains
were doing exclusives.

24:48.638 --> 24:50.839
I mean toys were,
like, off the chain.

24:50.873 --> 24:52.941
It was like printing money.

24:52.975 --> 24:55.443
- From the mid-90s forward
there was a boom.

24:55.478 --> 24:56.744
Yes.

24:56.779 --> 24:58.646
Target or Wal-Mart would have
an exclusive figure

24:58.680 --> 25:00.314
that can only be purchased
at their store.

25:00.349 --> 25:01.448
Right.

25:01.483 --> 25:05.486
- And target had
these Batman Mego-li figures.

25:05.521 --> 25:06.988
They wearing cloth outfits
and stuff?

25:07.022 --> 25:08.322
- Yes.
- Oh.

25:08.356 --> 25:11.258
This was a way for them
to try to test the market

25:11.293 --> 25:15.630
to see if kids would flock back
to the Mego style of figures.

25:15.664 --> 25:16.965
Why are you
getting rid of them?

25:16.999 --> 25:19.067
I like them a lot,
but I've got a storage shed

25:19.101 --> 25:21.737
full of old comics
and transformers

25:21.771 --> 25:24.206
and stuff like that
so I'm just trying to downsize

25:24.240 --> 25:26.275
and see if I can make
some cash in the meantime.

25:26.309 --> 25:27.643
All right,
what are you looking for

25:27.677 --> 25:28.811
for this set of three?

25:28.845 --> 25:30.413
I would say
they're worth 50 each.

25:30.447 --> 25:31.681
- Okay.
- So 150.

25:31.715 --> 25:33.483
But, you know,
I know you've gotta sell them

25:33.517 --> 25:35.018
so if I could
get 100 out of them

25:35.052 --> 25:36.519
I'd be happy.

25:36.554 --> 25:39.956
They're not that rare
and not that expensive.

25:39.991 --> 25:43.026
I mean, obviously the Batman one
is the harder to find.

25:43.060 --> 25:46.796
If you had bought three Batmans,
you'd be sitting in the money.

25:46.830 --> 25:50.299
You and your wife would be
dining on filet mignon tonight.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.301
'Cause, I mean...
I know what's gonna happen.

25:52.335 --> 25:55.103
I'm gonna sell Batman,
uh, by the end of the week.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.305
Joker will probably go too
but penguin basically

25:57.339 --> 26:00.041
is the red-headed stepchild
of these because...

26:00.075 --> 26:01.475
- oh, really?
- Because nobody cares.

26:01.510 --> 26:02.676
- Nobody liked the penguin?
- No one cares about penguin.

26:02.711 --> 26:04.178
- No.
- Why don't people like penguin?

26:04.213 --> 26:05.746
He's just not sexy.

26:05.780 --> 26:08.015
He's just a fat old man
in a tuxedo.

26:08.049 --> 26:10.984
There's nothing about him cool.
I don't know, man.

26:11.019 --> 26:12.820
Imagine my boy with
a top hat and a monocle.

26:12.854 --> 26:15.156
- See?
- And a pointier nose.

26:15.190 --> 26:18.091
The penguin figure
is basically unmovable.

26:18.126 --> 26:21.461
- Why? Why is it
the only fat guy in comics...

26:21.495 --> 26:23.396
nobody wants or likes, man?

26:23.430 --> 26:25.397
It's just like kickball
all over again.

26:27.867 --> 26:29.901
Ten years ago I probably
could have got, like,

26:29.936 --> 26:32.003
50 bucks each for them.

26:32.037 --> 26:33.237
Not today.

26:33.272 --> 26:35.706
The toy market
I think's definitely shrunk.

26:35.741 --> 26:39.110
I can only offer you...

26:39.144 --> 26:40.912
20 for these two.

26:40.946 --> 26:42.514
Whew.

26:42.548 --> 26:45.050
- I know it's not much of a...
- It's pretty short from 100.

26:45.084 --> 26:46.818
- Of a payday for you.
- Yeah.

26:46.853 --> 26:47.853
- Yeah, but they're
depreciating... every minute

26:47.887 --> 26:49.821
you sit there
and think about it,

26:49.856 --> 26:50.856
price is going down.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.791
All right.

26:57.464 --> 26:59.433
Let's talk 40.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.469
That slide in
of the penguin...

27:02.503 --> 27:03.536
That's intimidating.

27:06.274 --> 27:09.075
Is that some sort of,
like, Alpha dog move?

27:09.110 --> 27:10.110
In my store?

27:10.144 --> 27:11.511
I think they come as a set.

27:11.545 --> 27:13.513
They come as a set
and go as a set.

27:13.547 --> 27:15.114
You should be
on your back right now

27:15.148 --> 27:16.916
showing your belly...
showing him your underside.

27:18.018 --> 27:21.053
- Um, 25 bucks.
- 25 bucks?

27:21.088 --> 27:24.957
25...

27:24.991 --> 27:26.592
Bucks.

27:26.626 --> 27:29.428
It's cold over here and lonely
and penguin needs to be back

27:29.462 --> 27:31.696
with his family.

27:31.731 --> 27:34.599
I could do 38 for all three.

27:34.634 --> 27:36.768
I could do...

27:36.802 --> 27:40.471
22 for all three.

27:40.506 --> 27:41.672
I'm going down now.

27:41.707 --> 27:43.407
Yeah, you're right.
You look perplexed.

27:43.442 --> 27:46.243
Every time that you try
to force that penguin on me,

27:46.277 --> 27:49.045
I'm gonna take it down
a dollar.

27:49.079 --> 27:50.580
So we're at 22
for just these two.

27:50.614 --> 27:52.581
- No, we're at 21 now.
- 21?

27:52.616 --> 27:55.617
You can't figure me out.

27:55.652 --> 27:56.718
20.

27:56.753 --> 27:57.853
Okay so essentially
you're doing

27:57.887 --> 27:59.855
a bugs bunny-daffy duck
on him right now.

28:00.891 --> 28:02.892
- Duck season-rabbit season.

28:02.926 --> 28:05.161
- It was a slow day, obviously.
- Obviously.

28:07.364 --> 28:09.866
25 for all three.

28:09.900 --> 28:13.404
I'm not... and now
just no more kidding around.

28:13.438 --> 28:17.375
- 25 for all three?
- 25 for all three.

28:17.409 --> 28:20.211
I could go 30.
I could go as low as 30.

28:20.245 --> 28:21.745
You can go as low as 30?

28:21.780 --> 28:23.314
Ugh...

28:23.348 --> 28:25.082
How about 28?

28:25.116 --> 28:28.318
29.

28:28.353 --> 28:29.753
All right, 29.

28:29.787 --> 28:31.320
Under 30 just feels good.

28:31.355 --> 28:34.357
You got a good deal,
you got a good deal.

28:35.526 --> 28:36.725
Thank you, sir.
All right, man.

28:36.760 --> 28:39.261
- Have a good one.
- Take it easy.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.442
- This your first tattoo, Mike?
- Yes, sir.

28:51.476 --> 28:54.579
All right, man, a virgin.
Love the virgins.

28:54.613 --> 28:56.915
Okay.

28:56.949 --> 28:58.149
So you nervous?

28:58.184 --> 29:00.352
Yeah, a little bit.
It's my first one.

29:00.386 --> 29:01.887
I keep hearing it's addictive.

29:01.921 --> 29:03.088
Very true.

29:03.122 --> 29:06.358
I'm worried about
one day getting covered.

29:06.392 --> 29:08.326
Mm, could happen.

29:10.596 --> 29:11.596
You want me to take
a little bit of

29:11.630 --> 29:12.697
the beard off too?

29:12.731 --> 29:14.598
Aah...Nah, that's all right.

29:19.270 --> 29:21.237
You ready?

29:21.271 --> 29:23.506
I'm ready.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.775
Before you start,
you ever have any mishaps?

29:25.809 --> 29:26.810
No, no, no.

29:26.844 --> 29:27.978
Like a misspelling
or anything?

29:28.012 --> 29:29.046
No.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.047
Never?

29:30.081 --> 29:32.015
We try not to do that.

29:32.050 --> 29:34.151
All right, let's go.

29:34.185 --> 29:37.154
All right, here goes.

29:47.233 --> 29:49.935
Your wife's name
with an "ie" or a "y?"

29:49.969 --> 29:51.270
I'm...

29:51.304 --> 29:53.505
It's not funny.

29:53.540 --> 29:55.741
So you guys all work
in a comic book store together?

29:55.776 --> 29:58.711
Yeah, me and him do.

29:58.745 --> 30:00.012
The bearded guy over there
he just kinda comes

30:00.046 --> 30:01.314
and hangs out.

30:01.348 --> 30:03.315
He's not really officially
an employee.

30:03.349 --> 30:04.650
Yeah, we have those
around here too.

30:06.086 --> 30:08.120
Anybody get any,
uh, superhero tattoos?

30:08.154 --> 30:09.655
Oh, all the time.

30:09.689 --> 30:12.123
We get the Supermans,
the Batmans,

30:12.158 --> 30:13.791
the ider-mans.

30:13.826 --> 30:14.859
Oh, that's cool.

30:14.894 --> 30:17.896
Yeah, I guess.

30:17.930 --> 30:19.264
I had this kid
come in one time

30:19.298 --> 30:22.301
and he wanted, um,
a superman symbol on his chest.

30:22.335 --> 30:24.804
It was his first tattoo.

30:24.838 --> 30:27.974
Soon as I put the needle...
he's, like, whoa!

30:28.008 --> 30:29.142
It was done.

30:29.176 --> 30:31.345
I go, bro, you picked
the wrong tattoo to get.

30:31.379 --> 30:34.381
You picked the superman symbol,
and you're bailing out

30:34.416 --> 30:35.849
on the tattoo
'cause of the pain.

30:35.884 --> 30:36.884
Right, yeah.

30:36.918 --> 30:37.952
You're supposed
to be superman.

30:37.986 --> 30:39.386
"Man of steel" you're not.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.022
How you holding up, Miguel?
I'm doing well, thanks.

30:42.056 --> 30:43.223
How you feeling over there?

30:43.257 --> 30:44.591
It doesn't feel
that bad at all.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.693
You might discover
a whole new world, man.

30:46.727 --> 30:47.860
Like, you like pain.

30:47.895 --> 30:48.928
Next thing you know,
you're out looking

30:48.962 --> 30:50.195
for that next fix.

30:50.230 --> 30:53.465
Getting your ass beat
by some dominatrix.

30:53.499 --> 30:55.167
Yeah, it would depend
on the woman.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.734
What do you require
in a dominatrix?

30:56.769 --> 30:59.303
I had no idea that you've
thought out preferences.

31:00.539 --> 31:01.839
Tough but loving.

31:01.874 --> 31:03.007
So she dresses you down
and then, like,

31:03.042 --> 31:04.809
cradles you
in her arms afterwards?

31:04.843 --> 31:06.077
- Yeah, and then
we go out and, you know...

31:06.111 --> 31:07.745
yeah, we go have dinner
at a nice place afterwards.

31:08.847 --> 31:10.081
You know what?

31:10.115 --> 31:12.283
I've never had a dominatrix,
so I can't say.

31:12.317 --> 31:15.152
Maybe that's what you need.
A woman to whip you into shape.

31:15.187 --> 31:16.187
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:16.221 --> 31:17.221
Maybe.

31:17.255 --> 31:18.622
Literally.

31:18.656 --> 31:19.790
Ho-ho-ho!

31:19.824 --> 31:21.225
Who said that?
Who said that?

31:25.963 --> 31:28.331
I'm starting
to really, really think.

31:28.365 --> 31:31.067
- Don't.
- Walt's not coming.

31:31.101 --> 31:32.335
Yeah, you think?

31:32.369 --> 31:34.103
I'm gonna officially
give up hope on him.

31:34.137 --> 31:36.305
Uh, you know what?
I think I have too.

31:36.339 --> 31:38.607
You gotta
dress him down, man.

31:38.642 --> 31:40.376
- Oh, I will.
- You gotta give it to him.

31:40.410 --> 31:41.744
You gotta turn the tables
on him this time.

31:41.779 --> 31:44.347
I will.
It's gonna be pretty sweet too.

31:44.382 --> 31:46.049
Where were you, man?
You never showed up.

31:46.083 --> 31:48.352
What happened?
Um...

31:48.386 --> 31:50.020
- Just admit to me
and to everyone at this table...

31:50.055 --> 31:51.222
- all right.

31:51.256 --> 31:53.357
That you're one big, rotten chicken.

31:57.229 --> 32:01.166
I have to say, uh,
ming respect gauge...Boom!

32:01.200 --> 32:02.233
Through the roof.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.735
Flanagan, pfft.

32:04.770 --> 32:06.003
Walt's out.

32:06.037 --> 32:07.705
All right, ming?

32:07.739 --> 32:09.540
I like it.
Let's overthrow him.

32:09.575 --> 32:11.709
There might have
to be a coup d'etat, Mike.

32:11.744 --> 32:13.177
Mike runs the stash.

32:13.212 --> 32:15.479
You're his second in command.
Yeah.

32:15.513 --> 32:17.081
And now I'm you.

32:17.115 --> 32:19.083
I don't like
this employed feeling.

32:19.117 --> 32:20.084
It's weird.

32:20.118 --> 32:21.485
Yeah, you're quitting already?

32:21.519 --> 32:25.089
I don't know
if this is gonna work.

32:25.123 --> 32:27.158
Jim Lee signature
on this one, huh?

32:27.192 --> 32:28.392
- Yep.
- How'd you get that?

32:28.427 --> 32:30.328
My mom flirted
with the security guard

32:30.362 --> 32:32.263
at my first
comic book convention.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.667
My mom was the greatest
supporter of my comic habit.

32:35.701 --> 32:37.135
But thank God
she didn't have to do that.

32:47.284 --> 32:49.319
Now Walt, you always
maintained that <i>the munsters</i>

32:49.353 --> 32:52.722
were a little more kid-friendly
as a like, a monster show.

32:52.756 --> 32:55.092
That was my soap box
for about a year or two.

32:55.126 --> 32:58.095
<i>The Addams family</i> was just
a little bit more creepier.

32:58.129 --> 33:01.132
You had Uncle fester
who was really weird looking.

33:01.166 --> 33:03.301
Putting light bulbs
in his mouth, doing weird stuff.

33:03.335 --> 33:04.869
What else was he putting
in his mouth, do you know?

33:04.904 --> 33:08.239
What would Freud say?
Orally fixated, yeah.

33:08.273 --> 33:09.474
Hey, how you doing?

33:09.508 --> 33:11.475
I'm looking
to sell some books.

33:11.510 --> 33:12.543
What do you got?

33:12.578 --> 33:15.145
I got a bunch of cool stuff.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.446
Yeah, you got
some old stuff, huh?

33:16.481 --> 33:18.081
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

33:18.116 --> 33:20.884
You know what this is, right?
It's the key book of the '70s.

33:27.591 --> 33:29.659
I'm definitely interested
in this one.

33:29.693 --> 33:32.696
You know you look
like kirk Cameron?

33:35.633 --> 33:37.767
I got that a lot.

33:37.802 --> 33:39.836
- Oh, look at this
<i>X-Men</i> number one.

33:47.345 --> 33:49.013
Jim Lee signature
on this one, huh?

33:49.047 --> 33:50.314
- Yep.
- How'd you get that?

33:50.348 --> 33:53.184
Um, my mom flirted
with the security guard

33:53.218 --> 33:54.752
at my first
comic book convention.

33:54.787 --> 33:56.287
Bumped me up
to the head of the line.

33:56.322 --> 33:58.256
- How old were you?
- I was about 14.

33:58.290 --> 34:01.793
I've always maintained my mom
was the greatest supporter

34:01.827 --> 34:03.061
of my comic habit.

34:03.095 --> 34:04.796
But thank God
she didn't have to do that.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.798
Grandma gave up the ass
so I could meet Stan Lee.

34:09.568 --> 34:11.168
Oh, "killing joke."

34:11.202 --> 34:13.036
Yeah, you remember this one,
right, Bry?

34:19.844 --> 34:21.110
Did you have this one?

34:21.145 --> 34:22.678
No, but I remember
it coming out and you and kev

34:22.713 --> 34:24.246
buying multiple copies of it.

34:24.281 --> 34:25.349
That's right.

34:25.382 --> 34:27.184
It was quite the wall-book
back in the day.

34:27.217 --> 34:28.485
It still is.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.321
It's still a very
historically significant issue.

34:30.355 --> 34:32.857
I don't think you can
take away the impact

34:32.891 --> 34:35.860
that Alan Moore, Brian Bolland
had in the Batman mythes.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.897
I mean, this is the issue
that they crippled batgirl.

34:38.931 --> 34:40.632
I remember more about
you and kev in the backseat

34:40.666 --> 34:41.632
as I drove.

34:41.667 --> 34:42.734
Oh, she's crippled!

34:42.768 --> 34:45.137
Oh, comics! Whoo!

34:45.170 --> 34:48.206
Oh, you even have
the Ditko <i>Mr. a</i> stuff.

34:48.241 --> 34:49.774
This is awesome.

34:57.716 --> 35:01.418
You don't see this very often.
It's almost like a newspaper.

35:01.452 --> 35:02.819
What is <i>Mr. a?</i>

35:02.853 --> 35:05.521
<i>Mr. a</i> was one of the very
first independent books.

35:05.556 --> 35:09.059
Steve Ditko had left mainstream
and put out a side project

35:09.094 --> 35:11.929
called Mr. a who was
the precursor to <i>the question.</i>

35:11.963 --> 35:13.230
- To <i>the question,</i> right?
- Right.

35:13.264 --> 35:14.732
Who's your favorite
Ditko character?

35:14.766 --> 35:16.367
- Uh, question.
- Me too.

35:16.401 --> 35:18.069
- Yeah.
- He's definitely my favorite.

35:18.104 --> 35:19.404
Wow.

35:19.438 --> 35:20.672
You're like the son
I never had, man.

35:20.707 --> 35:22.274
Wanna
go get a cup of coffee?

35:22.308 --> 35:23.775
Hey, you jealous back there?

35:23.810 --> 35:25.711
'Cause you don't know
what we're talking about, right?

35:25.745 --> 35:26.946
- Sure.
- This bugs you...

35:26.980 --> 35:28.213
every time somebody comes in

35:28.248 --> 35:29.348
and knows about comics,
the jokes come out.

35:29.382 --> 35:30.583
You get that big smile
on your face, like,

35:30.617 --> 35:33.019
"I wish you were my friend
instead of Bry."

35:33.053 --> 35:35.988
New model rolls up,
suddenly the old model

35:36.022 --> 35:36.989
looking a little
worse for wear.

35:37.023 --> 35:39.058
- Mm-hm, a couple of days.
- Yeah.

35:39.092 --> 35:40.559
A couple?

35:42.028 --> 35:43.362
- This guy,
he just was starry-eyed.

35:43.396 --> 35:44.830
You know, I'm buttering
the guy up a little bit.

35:44.864 --> 35:47.332
I'm setting him up
to be, like, an elk.

35:47.366 --> 35:50.134
Unaware, just sip that water
as I creep up behind you.

35:50.169 --> 35:52.036
And then mate with you.

35:53.706 --> 35:55.373
What are you looking for
for these four?

35:55.408 --> 35:57.642
What are <i>you</i>
thinking for them?

35:57.762 --> 35:59.211
- This is gonna be
a throw-in for me personally,

35:59.245 --> 36:00.645
because I just want to read it

36:00.680 --> 36:02.747
and, um, it probably
isn't worth that much

36:02.781 --> 36:04.849
in the condition it's in
with the staining.

36:04.883 --> 36:05.983
Yeah.

36:06.018 --> 36:08.085
Uh, killing joke,
um, the best I could do

36:08.119 --> 36:09.119
is 10 bucks for this one.

36:09.154 --> 36:10.821
Whatever number we come in on,

36:10.855 --> 36:11.888
it's gonna
be based on these two.

36:11.923 --> 36:13.857
- Okay.
- What do you think, Mike?

36:13.891 --> 36:15.558
425.

36:15.593 --> 36:18.794
- 425?
- Yeah, for all of them.

36:18.829 --> 36:19.929
Cue mom.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.198
To work her magic.

36:24.401 --> 36:28.304
Oh, hello, boys.

36:29.840 --> 36:33.644
At that, I don't think
I could let those go.

36:33.678 --> 36:34.845
What about 450?

36:34.879 --> 36:36.914
It's only,
like, 25 bucks more.

36:36.949 --> 36:39.450
500.

36:39.485 --> 36:41.119
What are you looking for?

36:41.154 --> 36:43.088
It would probably be...

36:43.122 --> 36:44.123
1,000.

36:44.157 --> 36:46.358
No, not for that price.

36:46.393 --> 36:48.593
But I'm really
interested in this.

36:48.628 --> 36:51.229
Can I buy this
off you for a buck?

36:51.263 --> 36:52.430
- For a buck?
- Yeah.

36:52.465 --> 36:53.431
I bought it for 5.

36:53.465 --> 36:56.100
All right, you just lost 80%.

36:56.134 --> 36:58.235
What about 12 for the pair?

36:58.269 --> 37:01.504
- <i>Mr. a</i> and "the killing joke."
- Yeah.

37:01.539 --> 37:03.206
- And a handshake?
- And a handshake.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
And a hug?

37:05.242 --> 37:07.510
And a hug.

37:08.579 --> 37:09.846
- Okay.
- Oh, wow, oh.

37:09.881 --> 37:12.783
Sealed with a hug
as most businesses these days.

37:13.985 --> 37:16.787
- A hug!
- God, was it awkward looking.

37:16.822 --> 37:18.857
- The sweet talk paid off, man.
- It did.

37:18.891 --> 37:20.825
See? See what he does?
He knows what he's doing.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.928
Sometimes you gotta know when
to go into a little bit of

37:22.962 --> 37:24.497
a soft touch and then
you go into another guy

37:24.531 --> 37:25.898
with a hard touch.

37:25.932 --> 37:27.299
It all depends on
who you're touching.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.134
I've never gotten
a soft touch in my life.

37:35.207 --> 37:37.574
- Anything from Walt yet?
- Not a word.

37:37.609 --> 37:39.309
I emailed him.
I haven't heard from him either.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.278
Maybe something's really wrong.

37:41.312 --> 37:43.213
What if our friend is dead?

37:44.415 --> 37:46.149
- There he is.
- He is alive.

37:46.183 --> 37:49.968
- Where the hell were you?
- I thought we had a date.

37:50.088 --> 37:51.354
- What are you talking about?
- Yesterday.

37:51.389 --> 37:53.923
Where the hell were you?
Oh, wait, let me take a guess

37:53.958 --> 37:55.358
you were at the toy store.

37:55.392 --> 37:57.394
Holding your wife's hand,
buying a video game system.

37:57.428 --> 37:59.129
Wait a minute.

37:59.164 --> 38:00.531
You guys really
went and got tattoos.

38:00.565 --> 38:02.166
You thought I was serious?

38:02.200 --> 38:03.401
- You backed out.
- Honestly.

38:03.435 --> 38:04.669
Honestly,
tell me what happened.

38:04.703 --> 38:06.404
Did you really
think I was coming?

38:06.438 --> 38:08.573
I found it just stunning
that they believed

38:08.607 --> 38:10.208
that I was gonna
go through with it at all.

38:11.711 --> 38:13.112
I had no intention
of ever going.

38:13.146 --> 38:14.680
And the whole thing
was predicated upon him

38:14.714 --> 38:16.782
going, like,
"remember back in 1995?"

38:16.816 --> 38:18.518
And then you two bozos
chiming in.

38:18.552 --> 38:20.820
I was, like, you know how
I'm gonna fix your two asses?

38:20.855 --> 38:22.722
I'm gonna throw
a challenge down

38:22.756 --> 38:23.923
and you're gonna
be stupid enough to believe it

38:23.958 --> 38:25.591
and go there and get tattoos.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.393
This is the part of the movie
where the villain tells you

38:27.427 --> 38:28.393
his plan.

38:30.897 --> 38:32.064
You're angry I assume.

38:32.098 --> 38:33.331
Oh, I'm very angry.

38:33.365 --> 38:35.133
A real man does what
he says he's gonna do.

38:35.167 --> 38:37.268
- So that's all...
is that all I've lost?

38:37.302 --> 38:39.036
I've lost your respect?

38:39.071 --> 38:40.404
You're almost at the point
where you don't get to tell me

38:40.439 --> 38:42.073
what to do any more.

38:42.107 --> 38:43.074
- Whoa!
Ho-ho-ho!

38:43.108 --> 38:44.308
You hear when
he said it, though?

38:44.342 --> 38:45.576
His voice cracked!

38:47.012 --> 38:49.347
The boy's voice is quivering,
I'll give you that.

38:49.381 --> 38:51.449
I can't believe
he got the words out, though.

38:51.484 --> 38:53.051
I like this new ming.

38:53.086 --> 38:55.087
All right, man.
We've heard about them.

38:55.121 --> 38:57.890
Uh, we've talked about them.
We've lamented getting them.

38:57.924 --> 39:00.526
We fought over them almost.

39:00.561 --> 39:02.362
Can I see them?
Can I see the tattoos?

39:02.396 --> 39:03.763
I mean, this is the part
of the story where you're, like,

39:03.797 --> 39:05.097
"I put them on my wiener."

39:05.132 --> 39:06.865
Where'd you put the tattoos
and can I see them?

39:06.900 --> 39:08.300
On our wieners.

39:09.902 --> 39:10.969
Where'd you get yours?

39:11.003 --> 39:12.037
I got mine
on the back shoulder here.

39:12.071 --> 39:13.271
- Let's see.
- You wanna see it?

39:13.305 --> 39:15.139
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

39:15.173 --> 39:16.674
There it is.
Oh, that's good!

39:16.708 --> 39:19.242
It's a Chinese family seal
that my grandmother designed.

39:19.277 --> 39:20.310
- Good, man.
- Pretty bad-ass, right?

39:20.344 --> 39:21.378
Yeah, yeah, it's red.

39:21.412 --> 39:22.779
You gotta put some stuff
on that.

39:22.813 --> 39:24.280
It's infected.

39:24.315 --> 39:26.449
I didn't wanna worry him,
but yeah, it looks pretty bad.

39:26.483 --> 39:28.050
Zap, what'd you get?

39:28.085 --> 39:29.618
Uh, my wife's name
in scrimshaw.

39:29.653 --> 39:32.087
That's awesome, dude.
Look at that, man.

39:32.122 --> 39:34.423
As much as I was
leaning towards the superman,

39:34.458 --> 39:35.792
I love my wife more.

39:35.826 --> 39:38.061
Well, that's good,
I mean you gotta say that?

39:38.095 --> 39:39.796
Yeah, it is kind of one
of those things, like,

39:39.831 --> 39:41.731
"give me a pat on the back
for doing what's right."

39:42.867 --> 39:44.067
Good job, Mike, good job.

39:44.101 --> 39:45.116
All right,
we covered these cats.

39:45.236 --> 39:46.669
What did you decide to go with?

39:46.704 --> 39:50.040
It's zombie sagie
riding a tricycle.

39:50.074 --> 39:51.574
Oh, my God,
look at the commitment.

39:51.609 --> 39:53.542
Dude, it's your arm.
It's a sleeve for heaven's sake.

39:53.577 --> 39:55.544
And it's got T.E.S.D.
In the middle.

39:55.578 --> 39:57.546
- A little
"tell 'em Steve-Dave" shirt.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.781
That is awesome.
Did you show your niece?

39:59.816 --> 40:00.982
I did.

40:01.017 --> 40:02.617
Little kid!
Bryan!

40:02.652 --> 40:03.818
Hi.

40:03.853 --> 40:05.754
Hello, what are you doing?

40:05.788 --> 40:07.790
- I'm a zombie.
- You're a zombie?

40:07.824 --> 40:09.658
- Yes.
- Oh.

40:09.693 --> 40:11.094
Did I tell you?

40:11.128 --> 40:12.428
Do you like zombies?

40:12.463 --> 40:15.064
Do you want me to show you
a picture of zombie sagie?

40:15.099 --> 40:16.599
You do? Okay.

40:16.634 --> 40:19.502
You ready?
Yes.

40:19.537 --> 40:21.238
Zombie sagie.

40:21.272 --> 40:23.674
- The zombie's me.
- That is you.

40:23.708 --> 40:24.842
She loves it.
I know.

40:24.876 --> 40:26.143
I was sweatin' it a little bit.
Really?

40:26.177 --> 40:27.878
See, you're riding your bike.

40:27.913 --> 40:29.146
Unh.

40:29.180 --> 40:30.681
Okay, we'll go get something
to eat, okay?

40:30.715 --> 40:33.283
You like zombies?

40:33.318 --> 40:35.152
Say, "Walt I love zombies."

40:35.186 --> 40:37.120
Walt, raah!

40:40.190 --> 40:42.124
Ready?
You wanna go?

40:42.159 --> 40:43.259
Okay.

40:43.293 --> 40:44.660
- All right,
be back in a half-hour.

40:44.694 --> 40:46.028
Come on, man.

40:46.062 --> 40:47.663
This ain't no hour lunch break.

40:47.698 --> 40:50.901
Okay, thanks for pretending
I'm employed in front of her.

40:53.338 --> 40:54.705
Bye, Walt.
- Bye-bye.

40:54.739 --> 40:57.641
Bye.

40:57.675 --> 40:59.143
Well, man,
it's kind of amazing.

40:59.177 --> 41:01.078
You guys all went out
and got some ink

41:01.112 --> 41:03.214
that'll be on your bodies
until you go to the grave.

41:03.248 --> 41:05.550
It'll be on your bodies
even afterwards.

41:05.584 --> 41:08.987
Um, it started as what seemed
like a bonding exercise

41:09.021 --> 41:11.423
but ended in
a real big comeuppance.

41:13.159 --> 41:16.328
Some feelings were hurt,
there was a lot of confusion.

41:16.362 --> 41:17.962
But I think
we all learned something.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.497
I can't believe it,
man, but that's it

41:19.532 --> 41:21.433
