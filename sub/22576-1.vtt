<i>Kim Byung-su 's Journal</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:14.301
Who am I?

02:14.843 --> 02:15.927
Prosecutor Kim Min-je.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.930
Good.

02:20.515 --> 02:25.015
Then, let's see.
Since your mind is clear,

02:26.146 --> 02:27.897
let's get started.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.653
Without leaving out
a single detail of your life,

02:34.112 --> 02:36.989
tell me everything
that you remember.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.784
As you wrote in your journal.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.202
Like a confession.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.835
Let's start from here.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.254
September 8.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.549
The day you went
to the police station.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.936
- Salute!
- Yup.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.942
Look who's here again.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.737
Did you forget
where you live again?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.531
- Help him with the bag.
- Of course.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.450
- You can give that to me.
- Take it easy.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.079
Then do you know me'?

03:24.746 --> 03:27.665
What's my name?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.171
An...

03:35.924 --> 03:39.928
An... Byung...

03:46.643 --> 03:49.354
Don't remember.
Who are you?

03:50.772 --> 03:53.191
That feels bad.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.109
What's with the puppy?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.695
He brought it.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.406
Dad!

04:01.700 --> 04:02.826
You okay?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.622
You put your shoes
on wrong feet again

04:08.373 --> 04:10.500
like a child.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.841
Are you alright?

04:21.178 --> 04:24.139
<i>I was diagnosed with
dementia 3 months ago.</i>

04:24.556 --> 04:26.057
<i>The doctor said,</i>

04:26.183 --> 04:30.020
<i>recent memories will flicker
like traffic lights,</i>

04:30.228 --> 04:32.146
<i>and all memories will
fade in time.</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:34.482
We're not sure
what stage it's at.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.820
The hippocampus has shrunk,
so Alzheimer's progressing too.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.407
Can the symptoms stop?

04:43.533 --> 04:47.203
They can be slowed down,
but they can't be stopped.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.831
Try to hold onto the memories.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.751
Alright...

04:54.461 --> 04:58.961
Whoa... You had a brain surgery
after an accident.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.801
We'll have to do a full
medical checkup,

05:02.219 --> 05:06.640
but this could due to hemorrhage
from that or an aftereffect.

05:29.538 --> 05:34.038
<i>A body of a Woman in her 20s
was found in Kanghwa City today.</i>

05:36.419 --> 05:40.840
<i>This is the 2nd murder case
in the city after a high school girl</i>

05:40.924 --> 05:44.636
<i>was found dead last month.</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:49.219
<i>The police stated that
both bodies share similarities,</i>

05:49.933 --> 05:54.433
<i>and are open to the possibility
of a new serial killing case.</i>

05:54.729 --> 05:59.229
<i>The body was inside a luggage
and thrown away in this mud flat.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:04.860
<i>The victim is identifed as
a 20-year old resident of Kanghwa,</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.826
<i>and much like the last victim,</i>

06:08.910 --> 06:11.370
<i>her body was wrapped
in plastic wrap,</i>

06:11.454 --> 06:15.082
<i>and bruises were found
on her neck and wrists.</i>

06:27.804 --> 06:29.305
It's getting dark,
Where are you going?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.724
I told you,
it's my friend's birthday.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.768
There was a murder
in the next town.

06:33.852 --> 06:37.730
Don't worry.
Careful of the stove, okay?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.776
Murder isn't all that common.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.532
<i>But it can be, Eun-hee.</i>

06:50.243 --> 06:52.536
<i>Because I am a murderer.</i>

06:54.247 --> 06:55.623
<i>Kim Byung-su</i>

06:55.707 --> 06:57.417
<i>The password is incorrect.</i>

07:09.137 --> 07:10.304
<i>Memory</i>

07:10.388 --> 07:11.555
<i>Journal</i>

07:13.516 --> 07:16.435
<i>Autumn, 1971,
father returned home.</i>

07:20.398 --> 07:21.857
<i>When I opened the door...</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:43.379
<i>My white shoe</i>

07:46.508 --> 07:48.843
<i>was covered
in kimchi sauce...</i>

07:55.517 --> 07:56.643
Byung-su.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.731
Shouldn't you greet
your dear father?

08:01.940 --> 08:02.941
Byung-su.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.525
Honey, don't do this.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.152
At attention!

08:06.611 --> 08:07.612
At attention!

08:07.862 --> 08:09.029
At attention!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.036
<i>His slap was still first rate.</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:16.079
Byung-su!

08:16.788 --> 08:17.997
Byung-su.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.083
Byung-su.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.459
Byung-su.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.645
Alright, boy.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.904
Let me give you
a proper beating today.

08:50.572 --> 08:55.072
<i>It was the look of a beast.</i>

09:06.379 --> 09:09.590
<i>My sister shook in fear.</i>

10:06.815 --> 10:07.941
Curfew in effect!

10:11.986 --> 10:15.656
<i>I trembled all night
after burying the body.</i>

10:15.824 --> 10:18.785
<i>But the day after,
and the day after,</i>

10:19.702 --> 10:21.787
<i>no one came to arrest me.</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:26.584
<i>And peace found its way
to our home.</i>

10:27.836 --> 10:31.130
<i>I realized then that
obligatory murder</i>

10:31.339 --> 10:33.507
<i>exists in the world.</i>

10:34.384 --> 10:38.346
<i>I continued to kill
after that day.</i>

10:39.097 --> 10:43.434
<i>Seafood merchant
who beat his family everyday.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:53.819
<i>That wasn't murder.</i>

10:54.904 --> 10:56.238
<i>Let's call it 'cleansing.'</i>

10:57.115 --> 11:00.827
<i>There are plenty of people
who deserved to die,</i>

11:01.202 --> 11:04.830
<i>and I began to cleanse them
from this world.</i>

11:06.624 --> 11:10.419
<i>For swallowing a diamond ring,
she beat her dog to death,</i>

11:11.838 --> 11:16.338
<i>and brought it to me
to cut its belly open.</i>

11:26.686 --> 11:29.897
<i>Alcoholic homeless man
who took in runaways</i>

11:30.315 --> 11:32.400
<i>and used them as slaves.</i>

11:34.027 --> 11:37.739
<i>Loanshark who led an entire
family to their demise.</i>

11:39.032 --> 11:42.201
<i>None of them deserved
to exist in this world.</i>

11:45.788 --> 11:50.288
<i>Most of the trash I collected
are buried in this bamboo grove.</i>

11:53.546 --> 11:56.215
Cleansing... Trash...

11:57.258 --> 12:01.758
It sounds more like
crime fiction than a journal.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.776
How many did you kill then?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.073
<i>I didn't just kill.</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:24.702
<i>If you think about it,
I saved lives.</i>

12:25.495 --> 12:29.916
<i>Lives of men and animals,
what's the difference?</i>

12:37.674 --> 12:41.427
<i>I'm glad I can still work
even with dementia.</i>

12:41.928 --> 12:46.140
<i>30 years of muscle memory
won't just fade away.</i>

12:46.224 --> 12:47.433
It's alright, kitty.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.852
Good, very good.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.406
<i>I had forgotten about
the morning injection.</i>

13:03.366 --> 13:05.993
<i>Michelle died after
3 anticancer injections.</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:09.997
- Mom!
- Let go!

13:10.748 --> 13:11.999
- Don't do this!
- Michelle!

13:12.083 --> 13:13.918
- Please, morn!
- Let go!

13:14.585 --> 13:17.170
Don't do this!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.425
Michelle...

13:22.176 --> 13:23.635
<i>That's the last straw.</i>

13:28.808 --> 13:30.935
I ate noodles for dinner.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.270
I took dementia pills too.

13:33.938 --> 13:38.438
Go to poetry lecture
at Community Center at 7.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.906
'The knife pierces through
the bones and muscles.'

13:44.824 --> 13:49.324
'Crimson blood splatters
on my chest.'

13:51.164 --> 13:54.292
<i>Eun-hee said poetry is good
for dementia and signed me up.</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:56.043
<i>But it's nauseating.</i>

13:56.294 --> 13:58.713
<i>People don't know
what his deal is,</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:02.174
<i>but he gets involved
with these cougars.</i>

14:02.717 --> 14:06.345
<i>The old me would've
buried him already.</i>

14:13.811 --> 14:14.937
Mr. Kim?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.231
You've never learned
poetry before?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.821
Does it require schooling?

14:23.905 --> 14:24.906
Of course not.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.991
Early bad habits could
ruin your wording.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.994
It's perfect as is.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.662
With raw language and

14:31.913 --> 14:33.414
imagination of death,

14:33.748 --> 14:37.418
you're showing futility of life.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.170
With acute choice of words.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.925
Like so,
poetry cannot be learned.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.552
Like Mr. Kim,

14:46.844 --> 14:48.846
the poet captures language

14:49.514 --> 14:53.267
and kills it
like an experienced killer.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.936
By the way, Mr. Kim.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.856
Have you ever
killed someone?

15:01.442 --> 15:04.486
Right.
My apologies.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.782
I was being funny!

15:11.702 --> 15:12.661
<i>Funny?</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:17.541
<i>According to Eun-hee,
I don't exhibit emotion.</i>

15:18.209 --> 15:21.378
<i>To be concise,
I actually don't have emotions.</i>

15:22.672 --> 15:24.548
<i>But I do react to humor.</i>

15:25.716 --> 15:27.134
<i>Timing's the problem.</i>

15:34.475 --> 15:36.602
Mr. Kim! Wait!

15:37.645 --> 15:39.063
Mr. Kim!

15:40.314 --> 15:42.649
Hello, my name is Jo Yun-ju.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.027
Aren't you Mr. Kim Byung-su?

15:45.486 --> 15:48.113
I loved your poetry today.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.157
I was so moved.

15:50.283 --> 15:54.453
Especially your metaphor
for death in the poetry...

15:54.620 --> 15:55.912
What's a metaphor?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.625
Come on, sir,
you know what it is.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.419
It's a comparison.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.921
It's not a comparison.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.088
What?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
It was a life story.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.594
You're such a funny man.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.100
L'm funny?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.272
Should I skin you too?

16:21.606 --> 16:22.648
Skin me...

16:28.863 --> 16:31.115
<i>It was a vulgar laugh.</i>

16:32.783 --> 16:35.285
<i>This world is still
overflowing with trash,</i>

16:36.370 --> 16:39.623
<i>but regrettably,
I can't kill anymore.</i>

16:40.208 --> 16:42.376
Sir, how about tea?

16:44.795 --> 16:49.049
<i>17 years ago,
I killed for the last time.</i>

16:50.927 --> 16:55.427
<i>I don't remember
why I killed her,</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:58.142
<i>but after killing her,</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:04.857
<i>I buried her in the grove
and was on the way home.</i>

17:17.703 --> 17:18.829
<i>The accident</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:22.375
<i>must have caused
this problem.</i>

17:25.169 --> 17:28.463
<i>If murder is poetry,
then child care is prose.</i>

17:28.589 --> 17:29.840
Daddy“.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.259
<i>Raising a person</i>

17:33.344 --> 17:36.472
<i>takes more effort
than killing 10.</i>

17:37.139 --> 17:39.599
You're bleeding.
What's Wrong?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.811
<i>Maybe it was a good thing.</i>

17:58.077 --> 18:00.454
<i>Dammit, it's happening again.</i>

18:02.331 --> 18:04.833
<i>When the convulsion begins,
I forget my way back.</i>

18:05.668 --> 18:07.586
<i>Memories start to fade.</i>

20:02.451 --> 20:03.535
Are you okay?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.498
That's a deer.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.875
It appeared out of nowhere.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.421
If it's okay with you,
we can forget the collision.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.801
Just in case,
let's exchange contacts.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.220
So that there's no
misunderstanding later.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.807
- I said it's okay.
- No.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.855
This was my fault,
so send me the bill.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.113
We can do
our own repairs.

20:41.866 --> 20:42.908
Your business card.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.763
6145 PM on the 10th,
collision at Aewol Junction,

21:09.268 --> 21:12.604
2OL8588,
silver Sonata.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.943
He's... a killer.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.830
I should've...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.583
I should've killed him
at that moment.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.386
And then?
Keep talking.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.777
<i>Blood type O.</i>

22:01.529 --> 22:03.072
<i>Deers don't have type O.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:04.698
This is human blood.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.828
<i>2 serial killers in one city...</i>

22:10.579 --> 22:14.291
<i>Did he recognize me
like I did him?</i>

22:15.209 --> 22:16.418
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

22:17.419 --> 22:19.337
<i>I can't live here with him.</i>

22:19.421 --> 22:21.673
<i>20L8588, silver Sonata.</i>

22:22.007 --> 22:24.801
Blood dripped
from the trunk,

22:26.428 --> 22:29.472
and a luggage was in there.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.601
<i>Who's there?</i>

22:32.935 --> 22:34.102
Food delivery.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.480
Dammit!

22:39.525 --> 22:40.776
Go!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.936
Damn!

23:18.272 --> 23:19.648
This drives me crazy!

23:34.496 --> 23:35.705
Please follow me.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.457
Which police station are you at'?
Kanghwa Police?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.253
Get out of here,
you petty police boy!

23:41.587 --> 23:44.006
I made acquaintance
with your chief!

23:44.757 --> 23:46.133
Let's talk at the station.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.183
Are you fucking deaf?

23:55.517 --> 23:58.436
That lady made acquaintance
with your chief!

24:43.315 --> 24:45.942
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, Wait!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.277
Wait!

24:47.361 --> 24:48.320
Let me off this once.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.573
Won't gamble anymore!
I was about to quit!

24:52.574 --> 24:56.244
My hubby is also a cop
and I have two kids...

24:57.329 --> 25:00.915
Please! Let this go!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.545
Really'?

25:06.922 --> 25:08.924
You really want me
to let this go?

25:20.394 --> 25:22.687
My dad was a police officer, too.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.192
When I was a child,
for my misbehaviour,

25:28.861 --> 25:31.613
my dad used to handcuff me

25:33.073 --> 25:37.160
and forced me
to stand outside being naked

25:42.666 --> 25:45.168
Girls on the street giggled at me.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.548
Whenever I begged
for his forgiveness,

25:51.592 --> 25:53.385
my dad said,

26:03.729 --> 26:07.733
"Sinners deserve
to be punished."

26:10.861 --> 26:13.280
He always said that to me.

26:34.593 --> 26:39.055
Are you saying that the lady
found in the toilet near the gambling den

26:39.139 --> 26:43.639
was also killed by Min Tae-ju?

27:01.703 --> 27:04.080
Officer Min, where were you
after your shift yesterday?

27:05.666 --> 27:07.167
We received a tip.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.921
Someone saw you carrying
a body in your trunk.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.505
What?

27:12.589 --> 27:13.840
Did you kill them?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.551
Are you the maiden serial killer?

27:42.995 --> 27:43.829
Hello?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.413
<i>Kanghwa Police,
is this Mr. Kim Byung-su?</i>

27:46.165 --> 27:48.667
<i>We looked into 20L8588
that you reported,</i>

27:48.750 --> 27:50.752
<i>about the luggage in the trunk.</i>

27:50.836 --> 27:51.837
Yes?

27:52.838 --> 27:56.591
It wasn't a human body,
but a deer.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.011
<i>- Thanks for the t/jo though.
-</i> How <i>did you get</i> my <i>number?</i>

28:00.596 --> 28:02.889
<i>The car owner gave me
your business card.</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:07.728
It was nothing at all,
so just forget it.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.783
<i>Then or now, all cops are dumbfucks.</i>

28:24.328 --> 28:27.789
<i>2 recent murder cases,
same modus operandi.</i>

28:28.707 --> 28:31.710
<i>Arteries were severed
and blood was drained.</i>

28:32.044 --> 28:35.005
<i>The body's weight was decreased
and was being transported</i>

28:35.297 --> 28:37.841
<i>when we got into a collision here.</i>

28:38.342 --> 28:40.052
<i>Where was he heading?</i>

28:40.844 --> 28:42.262
<i>If it was me...</i>

28:44.306 --> 28:45.765
<i>to the reservoir.</i>

28:50.187 --> 28:51.730
<i>The spot where the road ends.</i>

28:52.397 --> 28:55.108
<i>He wouldn't have carried
the luggage far.</i>

28:58.779 --> 29:00.071
<i>If it was me...</i>

29:28.725 --> 29:31.227
<i>Another woman in her early 20s</i>

29:31.311 --> 29:35.523
<i>was found murdered in Kanghwa
Aewol reservoir early today.</i>

29:36.358 --> 29:38.860
<i>The police was responding to
an anonymous tip,</i>

29:38.944 --> 29:43.444
<i>and it bears similarities
to previous victims</i>

29:46.910 --> 29:51.331
Hey, didn't Min had
an accident around there?

29:51.623 --> 29:52.582
Right.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.000
Min Tae-ju!

29:54.626 --> 29:57.629
Isn't Aewol junction
not far from here?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.923
The junction is just ahead.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.466
Why doesn't he answer me?

30:02.092 --> 30:03.134
It smells fishy.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.846
The guy who reported Officer Min.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.475
What if he caused the collision
and tried to frame Officer Min.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.643
Oh, that's possible.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.855
<i>Dongsung Veterinary</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:17.482
<i>Temporarily Closed from Sept. 10</i>

30:22.029 --> 30:23.405
Can I help you'?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.574
Are you here
for your cat?

30:26.908 --> 30:28.117
Is it sick?

30:32.122 --> 30:34.582
Sorry about that,
my dad is not well.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.210
What to do...

30:37.627 --> 30:40.338
You should take it
to the vet in the city.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.550
Let's go!

30:47.346 --> 30:48.680
He's a cop.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.182
- Really?
- Cool, eh?

30:56.563 --> 30:57.564
You busy?

30:58.148 --> 31:01.693
Because of those stupid
maiden serial killings,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.863
HQ and the station
are all going apeshit.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.032
So, what's up?

31:08.075 --> 31:10.702
I need to pull up
a car plate,

31:11.078 --> 31:12.913
I had a collision.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.833
The number is...

31:18.877 --> 31:20.461
I wrote it down.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.422
Hit-and-run?

31:22.798 --> 31:24.049
You should report it.

31:24.132 --> 31:27.760
No, I think he's from here,
I'd like to settle it quietly.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.137
Sure, I understand.

31:32.933 --> 31:37.228
By the way,
do you recognize me now?

31:37.813 --> 31:38.814
What?

31:41.191 --> 31:42.775
My name.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.362
An Byung...

31:47.155 --> 31:49.115
Chief An,
An Byung-man.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.284
Jesus Christ!

31:51.910 --> 31:55.413
You're clear as day now.
This is so confusing.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.501
Cabs don't come this far
at this hour.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.587
I'll be home soon, bye.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.062
Oh, hello there.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.858
You have no fear
for a tiny lady.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.653
It's dangerous to be out
at night in this town.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.156
Why don't you
give me a ride then?

32:31.408 --> 32:32.242
Get in.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.370
Thank you.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.398
Dad!

33:50.320 --> 33:52.405
Dad, it's me...

33:53.823 --> 33:55.533
What's Wrong?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.828
<i>My head may be
losing memories,</i>

34:00.580 --> 34:03.124
<i>but my hand remembers,
like an old habit.</i>

34:04.084 --> 34:05.293
<i>The killing.</i>

34:06.920 --> 34:09.630
<i>What if I had imagined
the collision?</i>

34:15.303 --> 34:19.306
<i>What if I had committed
those murders?</i>

34:21.518 --> 34:23.520
Serial killings in Kanghwa City?

34:23.812 --> 34:25.730
Didn't they happen in our town?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.692
As victims piled up
in this little town

34:29.775 --> 34:31.652
what did the police do?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.946
Serial killings?

34:34.072 --> 34:37.867
Dude, haven't seen
any old crime shows?

34:38.034 --> 34:41.161
Neither surveillance cameras
nor DNA analysis existed back then.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.790
Just staring at a corpse
until the case is closed.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.126
Why are you looking into
dust-covered cold cases?

34:47.293 --> 34:49.129
They are all statute-barred.

34:49.629 --> 34:52.047
What if that killer
continued to murder?

34:52.132 --> 34:55.635
Could be involved in the recent
maiden serial killings.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.887
You know what?

35:00.849 --> 35:05.349
Heard that serial killers can't forget
the moment of murder,

35:07.397 --> 35:10.858
so they just can't stop killing
once they started.

35:13.612 --> 35:18.112
All previous victims were
choked to death.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.418
<i>Mar/av Nun/very</i>

35:41.806 --> 35:42.932
How's Eun-hee?

35:44.643 --> 35:46.227
She's well.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.234
What brings you here
without calling first?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.989
You know that
senior home here?

35:58.782 --> 35:59.991
Are men allowed?

36:02.369 --> 36:03.536
Who?

36:06.665 --> 36:07.832
I got dementia.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.586
I don't want to be
a burden to Eun-hee.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.048
I'd rather be yours.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.935
Am I getting punished?

36:36.486 --> 36:37.487
I'll visit again.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.618
Byung-su.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.123
You can forget it now.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.584
Let it go.

36:52.377 --> 36:56.214
I pray for you everyday.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.260
I'll take the punishment instead...

37:01.761 --> 37:04.096
<i>If I told her dad wasn't
the only person I killed,</i>

37:04.389 --> 37:06.140
<i>what would she say?</i>

37:08.143 --> 37:11.354
<i>Will she still pray for me?</i>

37:12.480 --> 37:14.440
Nietzsche said,

37:14.941 --> 37:19.441
“There is no devil and no hell."

37:22.824 --> 37:25.868
"Fear nothing further."

37:30.415 --> 37:34.915
"Your soul will be dead
even sooner than your body."

37:37.714 --> 37:41.008
<i>Goddammit...
I should really quit this.</i>

37:43.303 --> 37:45.722
<i>Or I may end up
killing this douchebag.</i>

37:46.222 --> 37:47.681
Mr. Kim!

37:49.434 --> 37:51.060
Wait, Mr. Kim!

37:51.311 --> 37:52.437
Oh no!

37:54.022 --> 37:55.023
Sir!

37:59.861 --> 38:01.529
Could you give me a ride'?

38:09.287 --> 38:12.832
It feels so good
to go for a drive.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.253
If you're not busy today,
how about a movie?

38:17.545 --> 38:19.004
I don't like movies.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.757
How come'?

38:22.008 --> 38:23.009
Because it's all fake.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.637
Fake?
Right, you're so right.

38:27.263 --> 38:31.267
Then what real things
do you like?

38:31.434 --> 38:33.269
Besides writing poetry.

38:34.521 --> 38:35.522
Killing.

38:35.855 --> 38:36.814
Killing?

38:37.857 --> 38:39.441
Jesus!

38:40.860 --> 38:45.360
What's Wrong?
That startled me.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.296
Dad?

39:00.713 --> 39:01.797
Who is he?

39:01.881 --> 39:04.174
Dad, the thing is...

39:04.259 --> 39:06.052
Hello, I'm Min Tae-ju.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.804
I'm Eun-hee's boyfriend.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.888
Is this your daughter?

39:10.306 --> 39:11.473
So pretty!

39:11.933 --> 39:12.808
Hello there.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.769
We go to poetry class,
I'm Jo Yun-ju.

39:15.937 --> 39:16.938
Let's go home,
it's late.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.272
<i>Dad...</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:19.857
Come on, Mr. Kim.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.442
It's broad daylight,
it's not late at all.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.945
Don't worry, sir.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.322
I'll make sure to
drive her home safely.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.449
<i>Who is he?</i>

39:28.575 --> 39:30.910
<i>He looks familiar
but I can't remember.</i>

39:30.994 --> 39:32.078
I'm a police officer.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.246
That's great!

39:34.539 --> 39:38.834
Young people together,
and old folks together, right?

39:39.627 --> 39:40.502
Let's go, Mr. Kim.

39:40.587 --> 39:44.048
See you, Eun-hee!
Let's go!

39:45.091 --> 39:46.217
Bye!

39:47.468 --> 39:50.137
No more frowning!

39:50.847 --> 39:53.015
Being a police officer is a great job.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.476
I'd be so happy for them.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.979
By the way...

39:58.730 --> 40:00.857
where are We going now?

40:02.692 --> 40:05.486
I've been meaning to ask you.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.448
Any specific region?

40:14.162 --> 40:15.621
Who are you?

40:24.631 --> 40:27.300
Shit.
Did I look desperate?

40:32.931 --> 40:35.224
Eun-hee's got a boyfriend.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.144
Min Tae-ju, police officer.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.107
Maybe this is good.

40:48.655 --> 40:49.864
Were you surprised?

40:49.948 --> 40:52.700
All dads are hostile towards
their daughter's boyfriend.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.619
I've met him once before.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.913
I recognized him.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.458
We had a collision
not too long ago.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.252
- What?
- It was a very minor one.

41:03.378 --> 41:07.006
I didn't think he remembered,
so I played dumb.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.509
He has dementia?

41:11.135 --> 41:13.762
Yes, Alzheimer's.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.349
Isn't it hard?
Taking care of him?

41:17.850 --> 41:21.937
Once in a While,
he feels like a stranger.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.607
Because he doesn't
recognize me time to time.

41:25.358 --> 41:28.361
By the way, why do you think
he was at Aewol junction?

41:29.529 --> 41:31.906
Probably went to
the bamboo grove.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.657
Bamboo grove?

41:34.158 --> 41:37.161
A long ago, he bought some land
and planted bamboos.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.746
When I was a kid.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.833
He sometimes go there
for a Walk.

41:42.458 --> 41:46.044
But he always gets lost there.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.062
<i>What's going on?</i>

42:06.315 --> 42:10.527
<i>Did they find any body
in the bamboo grove?</i>

42:11.654 --> 42:12.738
What's this all about?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.950
Byung-su!
We were waiting.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.744
They are students
from the police academy

42:18.828 --> 42:22.498
co-writing a thesis on cold cases.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.834
Say hello to Mr. Kim.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.294
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.921
On cold cases'?

42:29.047 --> 42:33.547
Yes, unsolved cases
like the Hwaseong serial murders.

42:34.385 --> 42:38.885
So we came here to inverview a local resident
who lived here a long time.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.684
Statute of limitation on those
has already passed, you know?

42:41.768 --> 42:43.603
We are researching,
not investgating.

42:43.686 --> 42:48.186
Those cases could be
related to recent murders.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.277
That's not possible.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.700
All recent victims are female.

42:58.159 --> 43:02.659
This killer maintained control
over the victims

43:03.289 --> 43:05.207
and used a cord
to strangle them slowly.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.586
He kills for pleasure,

43:08.836 --> 43:11.129
feeling the pleasure of killing itself.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.466
He's not impulsive and
knows how to contol himself.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.386
That's why
it's harder to catch him.

43:18.930 --> 43:23.430
Kill in the safe place and
dump the body somewhere else.

43:24.310 --> 43:28.810
That means the killer
wants to show off his work.

43:31.150 --> 43:35.571
Are you saying this one is different
with the previous serial killer?

43:39.700 --> 43:40.951
Totally different.

43:42.370 --> 43:46.870
The previous one killed both men and women
and didn't damage the body.

43:49.210 --> 43:52.755
As you know,
there must have been more victims.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.757
There were just
no other bodies found yet.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.427
He must've buried them thoroughly.

43:59.846 --> 44:03.850
That says
he's not a show-off.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.061
He didn't kill for killing itself.

44:09.021 --> 44:10.856
He must have a different purpose.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.696
What purpose?

44:26.372 --> 44:27.748
How do I know that?

44:28.833 --> 44:30.292
Am I that killer?

44:35.923 --> 44:40.423
Why bother me with things
you can find in the old newspapers?

45:05.578 --> 45:06.829
Byung-su.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.416
Your clinic was closed.
Are you getting worse?

45:10.583 --> 45:12.585
Gotta wait and see.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.589
Why don't you sell it off
and live somewhere else?

45:17.715 --> 45:18.841
For Eun-hee's sake too.

45:18.925 --> 45:20.927
And look for a decent hospital too.

45:21.052 --> 45:23.095
No point in staying
in this blasted town.

45:23.554 --> 45:24.930
Look who's talking.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.100
Why are you rotting
in this town'?

45:29.310 --> 45:31.770
I don't know if you remember,

45:32.480 --> 45:35.733
there was Doremi supermarket.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.235
A cigarette store beside it.

45:39.737 --> 45:44.237
A girl used to work there,
she smiled all the time.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.286
Remember her?

45:48.537 --> 45:52.290
I bought smokes everyday,
'88 Light'.

45:53.042 --> 45:56.503
She knew I bought smokes
in the morning and at night,

45:56.921 --> 45:59.340
so she waited until
I came by

45:59.715 --> 46:01.925
then closed shop
and went home.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.094
Always.

46:06.055 --> 46:10.555
“Sir, don't smoke too much,"
she said one day.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.819
I didn't see her after that day.

46:21.946 --> 46:26.446
Her morn begged me
to find even her body,

46:28.786 --> 46:31.455
and she would've given up
if there was a body.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.293
Since that day,
I quit smoking.

46:41.424 --> 46:45.219
This is the last pack
I bought from her.

46:46.220 --> 46:50.140
I'm gonna get the killer
and have a smoke.

46:52.351 --> 46:55.729
Shit, it's been 17 years already.

46:55.855 --> 46:57.064
Oh man...

47:02.945 --> 47:05.238
Alive somewhere maybe?

47:08.200 --> 47:10.660
- The cigarette shop girl?
- No.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.913
The serial killer.

47:15.374 --> 47:19.874
The recent maiden serial killings
could be his work.

47:24.884 --> 47:26.135
Doubt it.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.846
I wish it was him.

47:33.309 --> 47:37.809
Alright!
I should get going!

47:46.614 --> 47:50.826
Byung-su, that favor you asked
2OL8588.

47:51.619 --> 47:52.536
8588?

47:52.620 --> 47:55.039
You said you got into a collision.

47:55.122 --> 47:59.622
His name is Min Tae-ju,
he's a cop, HQ Info Division.

48:02.671 --> 48:06.091
I think
it's best to let it go.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.759
What do you mean?

48:08.677 --> 48:11.596
Huh? You don't
remember it again?

48:15.518 --> 48:18.646
Then forget about it, okay?
Bye!

48:26.404 --> 48:27.405
Min Tae-ju?

48:34.829 --> 48:37.206
<i>Eun-hee's got a boyfriend.</i>

48:37.331 --> 48:39.291
<i>Min Tae-ju, police officer.</i>

48:39.583 --> 48:41.543
Hello, I'm Min Tae-ju.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.088
I'm Eun-hee's boyfriend.

48:45.423 --> 48:46.841
Don't worry, sir.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.593
I'll make sure to
drive her home safely.

48:51.303 --> 48:55.056
<i>2 recent murder cases,
same modus operandi.</i>

48:55.391 --> 48:58.185
<i>Arteries were severed
and blood was drained.</i>

48:59.854 --> 49:04.149
<i>Did he recognize me
like I did him?</i>

49:06.527 --> 49:07.611
<i>Blood type O.</i>

49:08.863 --> 49:10.197
<i>This is human blood.</i>

49:10.573 --> 49:14.326
<i>20L8588, silver Sonata.</i>

49:15.161 --> 49:19.623
<i>6145 PM on the 10th,
collision at Aewol Junction.</i>

49:22.793 --> 49:25.921
<i>He's a killer.</i>

49:27.882 --> 49:29.341
<i>My daughter is in danger.</i>

49:41.020 --> 49:43.647
<i>- Where</i> are you?
- The movies. I'll call back later.

49:48.611 --> 49:49.612
Eun-hee!

49:50.362 --> 49:51.654
Eun-hee!

49:52.740 --> 49:53.782
Eun-hee!

50:54.009 --> 50:56.344
<i>Why am I crying here?</i>

51:00.140 --> 51:01.266
Eun-hee!

51:02.518 --> 51:03.560
Eun-hee!

51:07.022 --> 51:08.064
A killer!

51:09.858 --> 51:11.484
A killer!
Has my daughter!

51:11.777 --> 51:12.778
Listen!

51:14.822 --> 51:18.867
A serial killer
took my daughter!

51:19.368 --> 51:20.786
I can't find her!

51:21.620 --> 51:23.163
Go find her at once!

51:26.625 --> 51:30.712
<i>I said I'm at the movies.
How many times did you call?</i>

51:35.134 --> 51:36.218
Where is he?

51:36.343 --> 51:37.302
Who?

51:37.469 --> 51:39.721
- L\/lin Tae-ju!
- He went home.

51:41.223 --> 51:43.308
- That hurts!
- How did you meet him?

51:43.392 --> 51:44.851
Random encounter.

51:45.394 --> 51:46.311
Random, how?

51:46.395 --> 51:48.188
He drove me home at night,
said it was dangerous.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.274
Why get inside a stranger's car?

51:51.859 --> 51:53.360
Dad! That hurts!

51:53.527 --> 51:54.319
Shut it!

51:55.321 --> 51:56.280
Come inside!

51:57.823 --> 51:58.949
Sit!

52:00.326 --> 52:01.452
Listen carefully!

52:01.619 --> 52:03.621
- I know Mlin Tae-ju!
- I know!

52:03.662 --> 52:05.747
He said you collided into his car.

52:05.831 --> 52:08.041
And called the police,
accusing him of being a killer.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.502
Right, he's a killer!

52:10.586 --> 52:13.088
He thought
you were the killer!

52:13.797 --> 52:14.255
What?

52:14.340 --> 52:16.925
The reservoir murder
took place near the grove.

52:17.426 --> 52:20.554
The day you had the accident,
you went there, didn't you'?

52:20.846 --> 52:21.888
Do you remember?

52:24.808 --> 52:28.019
If you did, your shoes
wouldn't be covered in mud,

52:28.270 --> 52:31.106
so how do you
explain the mud?

52:31.815 --> 52:33.817
Where were you?

52:34.068 --> 52:37.154
Do you know
how scared I Was,

52:39.198 --> 52:41.116
while wiping mud
off your shoes?

52:43.243 --> 52:44.369
Are you...

52:46.747 --> 52:48.457
suspicious of me?

52:48.832 --> 52:49.833
Of course not,

52:50.918 --> 52:53.837
you're not a killer
like Tae-ju said.

52:55.047 --> 52:57.424
My dad isn't like that.

53:04.264 --> 53:07.350
You take your meds on time,
don't you?

53:10.688 --> 53:14.274
<i>Most coincidences in the world
aren't coincidences.</i>

53:15.484 --> 53:19.404
<i>He recognized me
just as I recognized him.</i>

53:20.114 --> 53:23.450
<i>He's using Eun-hee
as a bail' to lure me.</i>

53:23.784 --> 53:25.494
It's from the back of his car.

53:25.703 --> 53:28.956
It should match
one of the victims.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.708
Then he's verified
as a killer.

53:32.084 --> 53:35.420
Come on, he's a cop.

53:35.838 --> 53:37.339
What difference does that make?

53:37.923 --> 53:39.925
Does his occupation
automatically clears him?

53:40.843 --> 53:44.012
Don't look at me like that,
my mind is clear as day.

53:44.847 --> 53:47.933
Fine, let's say I'm out of it,

53:48.267 --> 53:51.853
but What if things
I told you are true?

53:54.940 --> 53:58.485
Okay, I'll send it
to the lab.

53:58.736 --> 53:59.945
L-low long?

54:00.821 --> 54:03.657
Well, to get it tested...

54:04.700 --> 54:05.867
About a week?

54:09.163 --> 54:10.539
Pretend that I'm a patron.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.875
Did you sleep well?

54:19.673 --> 54:20.924
What happened there'?

54:22.259 --> 54:23.677
Your dad did that?

54:26.805 --> 54:28.306
I'm off duty tomorrow.

54:37.900 --> 54:40.152
Come with me.
Come here!

54:40.360 --> 54:41.527
Dad!

54:42.654 --> 54:43.655
Get in!

54:44.072 --> 54:45.281
Hurry!

54:51.163 --> 54:53.665
Do not come near my daughter.

54:53.874 --> 54:55.542
We love each other.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.174
Stop this bullshit.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.012
I know who you are.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.514
You know who I really am, right?

55:10.140 --> 55:13.101
And you got to her
because of it.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.443
You're a goddamn killer.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.447
<i>Did you...</i>

55:28.867 --> 55:30.201
just confess?

55:32.037 --> 55:35.665
I don't remember.
I got dementia.

55:39.253 --> 55:43.382
I don't care who you kill,
so long as it's not her.

55:43.674 --> 55:48.174
Coincidence or not,
if you stay away from her,

55:49.763 --> 55:51.598
I'll leave you alone.

55:53.141 --> 55:57.641
But if you meet her again,

55:59.314 --> 56:02.275
I'll tear you to pieces,

56:03.610 --> 56:07.905
and bury you in the ground.

56:15.831 --> 56:17.457
Don't meet that bastard
for a while.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.043
What's going on?
What's with you? Why!

56:20.627 --> 56:22.086
Did you forget?

56:22.421 --> 56:24.631
Tae-ju is not a bad person!

56:24.715 --> 56:26.049
Just a week!

56:28.927 --> 56:30.803
After one Week,

56:31.179 --> 56:35.433
I don't care if you date
or marry him.

56:43.066 --> 56:43.941
Dad?

56:44.484 --> 56:48.154
Dad! Open this door!
Please open!

56:49.948 --> 56:52.200
<i>He definitely knows that
I'm a killer.</i>

56:52.576 --> 56:54.661
<i>Should kill him quietly
before it gets too late.</i>

56:55.871 --> 56:58.456
<i>Pentobarbital sodium.</i>

56:58.665 --> 57:02.293
<i>It's used to euthanize
cows and pigs.</i>

57:03.086 --> 57:05.213
<i>I may have to resort to this.</i>

57:29.196 --> 57:30.614
<i>Preparation complete.</i>

58:24.418 --> 58:26.920
<i>Go to sleep. Hurry.</i>

58:57.242 --> 58:58.952
<i>Goddammit...</i>

59:00.662 --> 59:02.664
<i>Why am I dozing off here?</i>

59:03.040 --> 59:05.459
Getting married
only after a month?

59:06.126 --> 59:07.710
Aren't you rushing things?

59:07.794 --> 59:10.421
Eun-hee is still a child.
She doesn't know anything.

59:11.006 --> 59:13.883
We can grow up together.

59:19.473 --> 59:22.767
If you two are happy,
that's good by me.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.770
I don't know if she
told you already,

59:25.854 --> 59:27.856
but I got dementia,
Alzheimer's.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.899
It must've been hard for her.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.444
I can check myself
into a hospital.

59:33.612 --> 59:34.863
Now I'm relieved.

59:35.614 --> 59:36.740
Dad!

59:37.199 --> 59:38.825
Wish you best of luck!

59:39.201 --> 59:40.660
We'll live happily, sir.

59:41.870 --> 59:43.162
We got any beer'?

59:43.330 --> 59:45.623
- You shouldn't drink.
- It's alright.

59:45.707 --> 59:47.375
Today is a day of celebration.

59:48.293 --> 59:49.294
Go on.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.136
By the way.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.100
I don't think this is
the first time we've met.

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:07.270
We've met a few times,
several days ago too.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:11.816
What did I say then?

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:16.196
You blessed our marriage.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.245
Well, well.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.090
- Give me a minute.
- Certainly.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.943
<i>I never blessed anything.</i>

01:00:55.777 --> 01:01:00.277
<i>I said, if you meet her again,
I'll tear you to pieces.</i>

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.452
<i>There is only one chance.</i>

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:05.787
<i>Insert deep,</i>

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:12.919
<i>grab him,</i>

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.006
<i>push him down,</i>

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:20.468
<i>choke him.</i>

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.987
Did I bless your marriage?

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:41.864
Son of bitch...

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.106
Dad?

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.503
Did he do this?

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.838
<i>Dad...</i>

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.298
When did you meet him?

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:42.675
Dad!

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:44.468
Come with me!

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.095
You promised me a week!

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.764
I told you not to see him
for a Whole week!

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:51.684
And you brought him home?
He could've killed us!

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.144
You did this!

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.647
It wasn't him,
you choked me.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.942
And it's been
more than a Week.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.069
You asked me
to bring him home.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:05.698
I'm sorry, dad.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.618
I can't do this anymore.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.710
<i>It disappeared.</i>

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:19.379
<i>The week faded from my head.</i>

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.341
<i>My hand remembers,
like a habit, the killing.</i>

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.718
Dad!

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:27.804
<i>Time's running out.</i>

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.849
<i>The memories of Eun-hee
may fade away,</i>

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:34.810
<i>and if my killer habits remain,</i>

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.479
<i>I may end up killing her.</i>

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:40.233
<i>I can't protect someone
I don't recognize.</i>

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:44.695
<i>Cement her in my memory
that she's my daughter.</i>

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.995
We could've talked
over the phone.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:53.871
Whose blood was it?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.749
It was an animal,
probably a deer.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.836
I became a laughing stock.
Take it back.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.010
<i>That can't be...</i>

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.182
<i>This is impossible...</i>

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:29.281
<i>but if so...</i>

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.832
<i>Was it really me, like Eun-hee said?</i>

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.252
<i>The reservoir murder
took place near the grove.</i>

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:42.712
The day you had the accident,

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.633
<i>you went there, didn't you?</i>

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.219
<i>If you did, your shoes
wouldn't be covered in mud,</i>

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:53.556
<i>so how do you explain the mud?</i>

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.121
Byung-su.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:23.586
Sis...

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:31.427
What's going on?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.142
My head is dying.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:42.021
It's wrinkling like a Walnut,

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.608
and full of holes,

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.153
and I keep forgetting.

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:52.865
The things I need to do,

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:57.287
the things I shouldn't...

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:06.045
As my memories flicker,

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.631
old memories will fade away,

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.222
and in time...

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:23.187
I may not recognize
my child anymore...

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.942
And then...

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.153
and then...

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:46.957
The Lord must've
answered my prayer.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:53.217
When you continue
to lose memories,

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:57.305
you'll go back to being a child.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:03.849
Gentle and endlessly naive,

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:10.275
my precious little brother.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:17.199
Come with me tomorrow.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.769
Byung-su.

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:49.690
Byung-su.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:01.869
Your journal is great.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.873
The passcode was
Eun-hee's birthday.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.583
You son of a bitch!

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.880
Who am I right now?

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.091
Min Tae-ju, the killer?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.470
Or...

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.015
your daughter's boyfriend?

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:33.901
What did Chief An say?

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.738
It wasn't human blood, right?

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:40.741
It could've been bad.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:45.953
I didn't think you still
had handkerchief.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:49.834
I read your journal and
swapped it with a deer blood.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.510
Why don't you kill
this woman, Jo Yun-ju?

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:01.845
You're dying to kill her.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.144
Let's be honest, okay?

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:14.942
Let's get her.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:18.487
<i>Mr. Kim!</i>

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:22.032
<i>I'm so happy that you called!</i>

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.325
Sorry.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.077
Wrong number.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.703
<i>Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!</i>

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:34.294
You son of a bitch...
I'm not a killer like you.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.465
So you don't kill
Without a reason.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:42.136
You only kill human trash
who deserve to die.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.055
Who decides that?

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.390
You make that call.

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:52.229
I only kill who I want to kill,
how am I different?

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:58.944
We're both killers cut from
the same cloth.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:05.326
Right, like you said,
I recognized you.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.661
I knew you were a killer.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.044
You have the same look as me.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.637
Don't touch Eun-hee!

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.181
If I wanted to kill her,
I'd have already.

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.475
What do you want?

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:32.936
You become me,
I become you.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:45.070
If you took on
my murder charges,

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.036
I'll think about it.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:55.960
L-low I should kill Eun-hee.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.004
Leave her alone.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.799
Kill me instead, you fuck!

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.175
Fucking moron!

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:05.636
You need to stay alive.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:07.596
At least while
I'm alive.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.683
No! Please!

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.895
Anyway, she's paying for
your sins,

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:15.980
so be thankful.

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:17.898
Not her!

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.699
Anyway you're blessed.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.746
Living is hell,
but it's only for a mement.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:36.291
You'll forget everything soon.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:05.278
Hey!

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.574
Where is she?

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:09.659
What?

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.544
Get up!

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.463
What's going on?

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.840
Stay with your aunt
at the nunnery for a bit!

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:45.945
Come on!

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.446
Let's go.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:49.740
Hurry!

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:51.868
Come on!

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.206
Only for a few days, okay?

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:58.582
<i>Dad...</i>

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.375
Get in!

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:09.509
Take care of her,
just for a few days.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.392
<i>I got one last task
I need to complete.</i>

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.437
<i>Killing Min Tae-ju.</i>

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:23.023
<i>Before I forget who he is.</i>

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:53.799
No...

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.551
<i>No, No...
I'm... I'm sorry!</i>

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.513
<i>I'm so sorry! Don't kill me!</i>

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:02.057
<i>Please don't kill me!</i>

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:05.185
<i>I'm so sorry. No!</i>

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:10.270
Shit... This was at the seafood
restaurant that closed down?

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.568
It was him all along.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.779
He had a body in his trunk
when I collided with him,

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:19.616
he broke into my house
and swapped the handkerchief.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.286
Min Tae-ju is the serial killer.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.876
He's coming.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.190
Let's talk to him together.

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:14.839
Look, 4 days ago,
did you meet Ms. Jo?

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.506
It was Friday night.

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:21.303
We checked her call log
and found your number.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:22.721
Sorry.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.598
Wrong number.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.141
Let's be honest, okay?

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:29.520
I bet your fingerprints are
all over the camcorder.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:32.481
- Wait, wait, Byung-su!
- Please calm down sir!

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.067
You son of a bitch!

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:38.612
I never met her,
he called her and killed her!

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:42.866
Then think of an alibi
for that night!

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.040
Where is Eun-hee?

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:54.128
I can't reach her,
it's been 4 days.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:58.716
Dunno.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:01.343
Tell us.

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:03.220
Dunno.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:08.934
If I tell that bastard,
she'll be in danger.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.687
Just trust me
and confirm his alibi first!

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:15.023
That night, he kidnapped Jo
and killed her!

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.360
That's enough!
Tell me where Eun-hee is!

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.112
Us cops will protect her!

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.865
No, I'll protect her myself!

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:28.449
If you don't, I'll be forced
to take you in!

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:40.044
She's at her aunt's nunnery.

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.888
Her aunt?
Your sister?

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.806
She doesn't have an aunt.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.308
Eun-hee told me herself.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:54.521
He'd often look for his
deceased sister.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.443
Am I wrong?

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.947
Give her a call then.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.241
To your nun sister.

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:09.286
Alright, you serial killer prick.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.082
I'll make you
eat your Word.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:23.842
<i>Sis</i>

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.052
<i>No results</i>

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.348
<i>Maria</i>

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.226
<i>No results</i>

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.607
What brings you here
without calling first?

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.360
Take care of her,
just for a few days.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:48.283
No, no, no!
Stop! Please stop!

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:53.159
Don't do this! Byung-su!
Where you going?

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.594
<i>Sis!</i>

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:55.642
Sis!

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.066
Sis!

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:13.577
Sis...

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.028
Shouldn't we arrest him now?

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:33.699
We don't have any
conclusive evidence.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.701
Even with such evidence,

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.620
can murder charge stand
with dementia?

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:43.250
Statute of limitation on his
early murders must have passed.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.379
It's gonna be hard.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:51.049
But Eun-hee too'?

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.344
No, no Way...

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.721
I'm sure he just can't remember.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.516
He couldn't have killed her
While he was himself.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.559
No, no, no.

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:07.774
We'll find out soon.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.075
Is this really a true story?

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.837
<i>I remember everything.</i>

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:30.797
<i>Sister...</i>

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.800
<i>And the last kill 17 years ago.</i>

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.598
<i>Who that woman was...</i>

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:54.904
Since when?

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:57.783
You'll kill me anyway,
just do it!

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:04.038
Why would I?

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:08.877
Just tell me when.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:15.300
And that you'll never do it.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:18.511
Then we can go home.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.556
Let's go to Eun-hee.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:25.268
Since when?

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:33.151
- A long time, right?
- Don't kill Eun-hee.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:35.445
Just kill me,
that'll do, right'?

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:39.115
She's innocent...

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.326
Don't kill her, please.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.036
Why should I kill her?

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:47.540
She's my own daughter.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.133
She's not?

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:01.346
She's not mine?

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.932
Eun-hee's not my daughter!

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:11.647
You piece of trash!

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:13.775
I'll kill you all!

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:17.195
I'll kill you and
your brat too!

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:22.344
<i>Dad...</i>

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:23.928
What's Wrong?

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.056
Are you hurt?

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:41.362
<i>Who...</i>

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:44.950
Who's your dad?

01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:48.869
Daddy, what's Wrong?

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.414
I'm scared...

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:27.325
Daddy!

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:31.955
Daddy, don't be sick!

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.055
Daddy!

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.600
Daddy!

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.354
Daddy!

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.191
Daddy!

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:10.535
Why are you crying?
Don't cry, baby.

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:14.956
You scared me.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:20.754
My head was hurting,

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.632
so I didn't recognize you.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.927
I'm sorry, don't cry.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:32.390
Don't cry.
Okay?

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.068
It's alright.

01:28:47.697 --> 01:28:52.197
<i>This sickening illness
began 17 years ago.</i>

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.261
<i>I had noodles with Eun-hee.</i>

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:14.849
<i>Only my killer habits
remained inside me.</i>

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:20.851
<i>All those recent killings were mine.</i>

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.611
<i>I killed Jo Yun-ju,</i>

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:32.988
<i>and the girl I called Eun-hee.</i>

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:40.792
What is it?

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.085
I found it!

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:43.252
Here!

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:57.433
Chief! I found Jo Yun-ju!

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:10.529
<i>Dementia did not save me.</i>

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.950
<i>Eun-hee is not my daughter,</i>

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:19.034
<i>and even if all the memories
of</i> killing <i>fade</i> away,

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:23.626
<i>I am still a killer.</i>

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:26.880
<i>I can't live here with him.</i>

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:29.006
<i>My daughter is in danger.</i>

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:30.842
<i>I'm sorry, dad.</i>

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:34.012
<i>I spoke too harshly.</i>

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:39.267
<i>And don't worry,
I'm not marrying Tae-ju.</i>

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:44.397
<i>And I won't send you away,
so thaws that.</i>

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:48.151
<i>I 'm going to live
for a long time with you.</i>

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:54.031
I believe you.

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.285
I'm always on your side.

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:03.412
<i>And before you forget
all memories of me,</i>

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:07.629
<i>there's something
I wanted to tell you.</i>

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.674
<i>I love you, dad...</i>

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.592
<i>The handkerchief.</i>

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.346
<i>I didn't think you still
had the handkerchief.</i>

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:23.060
<i>I read your journal and
swapped it with a deer blood.</i>

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:26.522
<i>Leave her alone,
kill me instead, you fuck!</i>

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:29.859
<i>Anyway, she's paying for
your sins,</i>

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:31.486
<i>so be thankful.</i>

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:35.114
<i>She'll die instead of you.</i>

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:39.786
Dammit...
It's Jo Yun-ju's body.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.540
I knew it.
That was the forensics,

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:49.337
the camcorder only had
Kim Byung-su's prints on it.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:53.674
Let's arrest Kim.

01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:11.943
Kim Byung-su, you're under
arrest for the murder of Jo Yun-ju.

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:14.111
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.821
Anything you say
can and will be used...

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:31.045
Taxi...

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:32.839
Taxi...

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:41.681
Get in!

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.851
Taxi, taxi, taxi...

01:32:45.518 --> 01:32:48.020
Take care of her,
just for a few days.

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:50.856
Hurry!

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:53.151
Call taxi...

01:32:58.740 --> 01:32:59.741
8...

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:03.953
8... 8...

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.414
<i>8... 8!</i>

01:33:07.373 --> 01:33:08.415
8!

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.417
8!

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.628
Taxi 8!

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.382
8...

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:21.762
Did you call a taxi?

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:29.354
- Get in.
- Why are you here?

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:30.897
I don't want to go!

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:32.648
- Listen to me!
- Don't do this!

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:36.193
Just pretend and
let's go away for a bit.

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:39.030
This is what's best for him.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.575
Take care of her,
just for a few days.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.585
8588...

01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:57.340
8588...

01:33:58.716 --> 01:33:59.883
Hello?

01:34:00.218 --> 01:34:02.220
- Min Tae -ju. . .
- Byung-su?

01:34:03.096 --> 01:34:04.514
He has Eun-hee.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:07.641
Rather than going on the run,
if you remember anything...

01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:11.103
Listen carefully,
it's Min's voice.

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:18.857
<i>If you took on my murder charges,</i>

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:21.155
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:25.493
<i>How I should kill Eun-hee.</i>

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:28.704
<i>Leave her alone.
Kill me instead, you fuck!</i>

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.206
<i>Fucking moron!</i>

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.291
- This will take...
- Jesus!

01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:35.961
Goddammit!

01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:39.966
I got change of clothes!
It's not like I soil my undies!

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:42.843
I bought some at the market
and changed them!

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:43.845
Hang up!

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.182
My wife is the bane
of my existence.

01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:50.643
This will take a few days.

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.312
Right? It's gonna
take a long time.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:57.316
I'm heading back to report,
are you coming?

01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:00.444
Yeah, I should.

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:03.739
But I'd like to clean up here
before heading back.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:05.783
Then I'll check in first.

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:17.462
<i>Byung-su! Was that voice
really Officer Min?</i>

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:21.840
<i>Dammit... So Min really is
the maiden serial killer...</i>

01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:22.925
<i>That psycho bastard...</i>

01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:23.759
Where is he?

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:26.136
<i>I'm going after him.</i>

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:28.640
Don't you dare lose him.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:32.560
Eun-hee's still alive!

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:46.115
Where's dad?

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:49.868
The cops are after him.
Let's sit down first.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.796
Dad's not a killer, right'?

01:36:01.839 --> 01:36:04.508
Bodies were found
in the grove.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:09.764
It's Jo Yun-ju,
who went missing,

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:12.641
and many sets of
skeletons too.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:16.938
You may not want to believe it,

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.732
but it's all done
by your father.

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:23.528
Also,

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:29.409
identification has to
confirm it,

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:32.453
but your missing mother...

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:36.624
No...

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:39.919
It can't be...

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:57.186
ls she there?

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.898
She's here,
with Min Tae-ju.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.358
Don't worry
and come at once.

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:05.903
I called backup
so everyone's coming.

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.449
So he killed
the cigarette shop girl.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.954
I'm gonna catch this bastard.

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:21.753
I got him,
that lying fuck...

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:25.422
Son of a bitch.

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:31.929
<i>What's going on?
Chief An!</i>

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:34.056
<i>Chief An!</i>

01:37:38.436 --> 01:37:39.645
<i>He's tenacious.</i>

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.774
<i>This is why I rarely kill men.</i>

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:46.819
Min Tae-ju.

01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:52.908
It's not too late to
turn around and leave.

01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:56.537
You'll forget everything anyway.

01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:58.247
<i>I know Eun-hee's there.</i>

01:37:58.331 --> 01:37:59.832
If you even touch her hair!

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:03.377
I'll kill her nicely,
so don't worry.

01:38:03.503 --> 01:38:04.670
Stay right there.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.425
Son of a bitch!

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:12.928
Tae~ju?

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.597
<i>Eun-heel</i>

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:17.933
Eun-hee!

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.477
<i>Min Tae-ju, you bastard!</i>

01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:22.479
<i>Don 't touch her!</i>

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:23.856
<i>Eun-heel</i>

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.066
<i>Eun-heel</i>

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:28.444
<i>Eun-heel</i>

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:31.155
<i>Eun-heel</i>

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:04.605
Kim Byung-su,
believe what I tell you.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:08.568
You're a killer,
you got dementia.

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:11.487
The person you're after
is Min Tae-ju.

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:15.658
He's a serial killer.

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:49.104
All women are the same,
my mother too.

01:39:49.775 --> 01:39:53.570
Dad tried to strip her
and throw her out.

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:56.615
Sinners deserve
to be punished, he said.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:39:59.618
But she was not a sinner.

01:40:02.413 --> 01:40:04.289
I was gonna stab him
with a kitchen knife...

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.096
But...

01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:25.519
I was hit from behind.

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:31.650
With a steam iron.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.031
Mom did.

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:49.209
Not dad, but morn.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:04.350
Women are all the same.

01:41:28.457 --> 01:41:29.833
This is all!

01:41:31.252 --> 01:41:34.713
Your father,
Kim Byung-su's fault.

01:41:35.965 --> 01:41:37.841
This is his fault.

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:44.098
What did I do'?

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:51.267
I wanted to live
happily with you.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:56.235
You lived with your dad.

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:03.033
With a murderer.

01:42:49.622 --> 01:42:50.664
Eun-hee?

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:53.709
Eun-hee?

01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:55.252
Eun-hee!

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:05.763
Eun-hee!

01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:09.809
Eun-hee!

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:12.519
Eun-hee!

01:43:14.563 --> 01:43:15.689
Eun-hee!

01:43:19.443 --> 01:43:20.527
Eun-hee!

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:31.121
Eun-hee!

01:43:53.144 --> 01:43:55.604
I'm sorry,
where am <i>I...</i>

01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.899
I need to go home.

01:43:59.775 --> 01:44:03.069
Why am I here,
I'm so sorry.

01:44:06.323 --> 01:44:07.991
I don't believe this.

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:13.079
Did you forget everything already?

01:44:14.457 --> 01:44:15.916
I'm sorry, I really am.

01:44:17.293 --> 01:44:19.295
It's okay,
everything's fine.

01:44:20.212 --> 01:44:24.341
But you still need to be punished,
so hold on for a bit.

01:44:25.509 --> 01:44:30.009
Because of you,
the woman I love escaped.

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:33.058
Wait here for a moment.

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.576
You know where she's hiding.

01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:56.540
Alright.

01:44:57.041 --> 01:45:01.541
Tell me where she's hiding.

01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:06.049
I'll pat you on the back,
tell me.

01:45:19.063 --> 01:45:20.272
Very good.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:24.818
Senile old man
is pissing his pants!

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:32.742
Mr. Kim, good job.

01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:47.132
Don't worry.

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:48.926
I'll kill you next.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.845
Rather than living as
the child of a murderer,

01:45:53.305 --> 01:45:54.931
dying is better, no?

01:45:55.516 --> 01:45:58.268
Living must be hell.

01:45:59.937 --> 01:46:04.437
You would've ended up
dying in his hands.

01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:11.949
<i>Dad...</i>

01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:15.911
Dad!

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:22.000
Dad,dad!

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:25.170
Eun-hee! Baby!

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.050
Tenacious.

01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:34.430
You're tenacious, Mr. Kim.

01:47:45.084 --> 01:47:45.918
<i>Dad...</i>

01:47:53.676 --> 01:47:54.677
You fuck!

01:48:02.267 --> 01:48:03.559
Shit!

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:03.495
I told you to turn
the car around and leave.

01:49:05.664 --> 01:49:06.831
Dammit!

01:49:17.426 --> 01:49:19.010
How about this, Mr. Kim.

01:49:19.595 --> 01:49:22.848
Since you're here,
watch her die.

01:49:25.768 --> 01:49:27.144
Doesn't that sound fun?

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:37.112
No, no...

01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:44.411
No, no...

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.332
No, you son of a bitch...

01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:50.375
You can't!

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:42.510
You'll...

01:50:47.599 --> 01:50:49.642
get yours...

01:52:02.007 --> 01:52:04.884
Were you really...

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.180
a serial killer from before?

01:52:13.352 --> 01:52:15.312
Did you kill morn?

01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:25.443
Don't come!
Stay back!

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:40.040
Like you said,
I'm a serial killer.

01:52:43.131 --> 01:52:47.631
I've killed so many till now.

01:52:50.847 --> 01:52:55.347
But the one who truly
deserve to die

01:53:00.899 --> 01:53:02.400
is me.

01:53:09.283 --> 01:53:13.783
Because I was born
as a murderer.

01:53:27.592 --> 01:53:29.677
You and I are different.

01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:34.599
That's okay, Eun-hee.

01:53:37.019 --> 01:53:38.145
Don't cry.

01:53:41.273 --> 01:53:45.773
There is not a single
drop of my blood in you.

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:52.450
We're not related.

01:54:04.546 --> 01:54:07.799
You're not my daughter.

01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.345
So you're...

01:54:15.932 --> 01:54:17.516
So you can't be...

01:54:20.937 --> 01:54:23.439
a murderer's daughter.

01:55:09.444 --> 01:55:10.570
Min Tae-ju...

01:55:15.784 --> 01:55:16.785
Min Tae-ju!

01:55:19.621 --> 01:55:20.830
Min Tae-ju!

01:55:31.716 --> 01:55:33.134
Min Tae-ju!

01:55:35.387 --> 01:55:36.888
Min Tae-ju!

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:29.774
<i>Kim Byung-su's Journal</i>

01:56:29.858 --> 01:56:31.150
Apart from

01:56:32.277 --> 01:56:36.777
Jo Yun-ju,
a total of 11 bodies were found.

01:56:37.407 --> 01:56:40.618
The statute of limitation
on those murders has passed.

01:56:42.704 --> 01:56:47.204
And you assert that Min Tae-ju killed
the recent victims including Jo Yun-ju.

01:56:49.169 --> 01:56:50.295
Is that right'?

01:56:50.754 --> 01:56:54.466
The audio recorder
that captured Min's voice

01:56:54.758 --> 01:56:56.050
also disappeared with himself?

01:57:02.098 --> 01:57:03.140
Tell me.

01:57:05.101 --> 01:57:06.268
Is that what you said?

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:09.814
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Can't you remember?

01:57:11.107 --> 01:57:12.358
Ok, then.

01:57:14.027 --> 01:57:16.612
There's one thing
that I really want to know.

01:57:16.655 --> 01:57:19.449
Tell me
how Min Tae-ju disappeared.

01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:22.410
Dunno.

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:24.704
Why not?

01:57:25.163 --> 01:57:27.874
You said you almost smashed him.

01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.459
I don't remember, anything.

01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:32.629
You really don't remember?
Or pretend not to remember?

01:57:35.507 --> 01:57:36.508
Okay.

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.301
The doctor said,

01:57:39.844 --> 01:57:42.805
people with dementia have a tendency
to remember what they Want to remember.

01:57:43.598 --> 01:57:47.852
They selectively piece together
their memories

01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:52.728
to attack the others
while protecting themselves.

01:57:53.608 --> 01:57:58.108
You are pretending
not to remember

01:57:59.155 --> 01:58:00.406
after you killed him
and buried the body somewhere?

01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:02.366
Tell me the truth.

01:58:04.536 --> 01:58:06.579
Ok, wait wait. Calm down.

01:58:09.708 --> 01:58:13.461
No, no, it's alright.

01:58:16.006 --> 01:58:17.507
It's okay.
Let him be.

01:58:23.096 --> 01:58:24.222
Release him.

01:58:26.683 --> 01:58:28.101
It's over.
Release him.

01:58:30.645 --> 01:58:32.063
- I said release him.
- Yes, sir.

01:58:40.447 --> 01:58:43.658
Open Min Tae-ju's investigation
to the public.

01:58:44.909 --> 01:58:45.910
Got it?

01:58:46.077 --> 01:58:47.203
Now you can go.

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:49.372
- This case is open now.
- Yes, sir.

01:58:57.756 --> 01:58:59.048
Right, right.

01:58:59.758 --> 01:59:02.135
Kim Eun-hee, the one
you raised as your own daughter.

01:59:02.302 --> 01:59:04.053
During the investigation,

01:59:04.262 --> 01:59:06.806
she zipped her lip
and refused to say a word

01:59:07.223 --> 01:59:10.184
to our questions.

01:59:10.894 --> 01:59:13.646
Not sure if she doesn't talk
or can't talk.

01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:17.275
Like she's got aphasia,

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:21.321
she couldn't speak
or remember anything.

01:59:28.286 --> 01:59:29.328
Sir,

01:59:30.246 --> 01:59:32.623
here's a set of Kim Byung-su's
MRI and CT scan images.

01:59:33.625 --> 01:59:34.917
What should we do
with this?

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.338
Do with what?

01:59:40.632 --> 01:59:42.884
Why do you think
the doctor gave this to us'?

01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:46.095
It is a proof
of Kim Byung-su's dementia.

02:00:07.158 --> 02:00:08.742
How hideous!

02:00:09.828 --> 02:00:12.789
Is this What dementia should look like?

02:00:12.956 --> 02:00:17.456
<i>Min Tae-ju, the serial killing suspect,
is still on the loose.</i>

02:00:17.836 --> 02:00:21.381
<i>The police is making every effort</i>

02:00:21.506 --> 02:00:26.006
<i>to locate the suspect's vehicle,
2OL8588, silver Sonata.</i>

02:00:28.096 --> 02:00:32.517
<i>The suspect's vehicle,
2OL8588, silver Sonata was last seen</i>

02:00:32.684 --> 02:00:36.479
<i>at the cabin in the woods
near the reservoir</i>

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:39.774
<i>where the suspect
killed his chief officer,</i>

02:00:39.983 --> 02:00:42.110
<i>and is still missing.</i>

02:00:42.277 --> 02:00:46.531
<i>Police will be expanding
their search area</i>

02:00:46.614 --> 02:00:49.241
<i>in case the suspect has already
escaped from Kanghwa City.</i>

02:00:49.576 --> 02:00:53.663
<i>After a photo of the suspect
was released,</i>

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:58.208
<i>police collected many tips
from the public.</i>

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.005
<i>The police created a special TF</i>

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:06.300
<i>to verify all the information
they received.</i>

02:02:01.648 --> 02:02:06.110
Without leaving out
a single detail of your life,

02:02:06.653 --> 02:02:08.196
tell me everything.

02:02:10.031 --> 02:02:11.782
As you wrote in your journal.

02:02:12.742 --> 02:02:15.453
Did you forget
where you live again?

02:02:15.578 --> 02:02:20.078
Heard that serial killers can't forget
the moment of murder,

02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:25.796
so they just can't stop killing
once they started.

02:02:26.047 --> 02:02:28.340
I should've killed him
at that moment.

02:02:44.566 --> 02:02:47.986
Why are you looking into
dust-covered cold cases?

02:02:48.653 --> 02:02:50.529
What if that killer
continued to murder?

02:02:52.907 --> 02:02:54.241
He has dementia?

02:02:54.367 --> 02:02:57.078
Once in a while
he feels like a stranger.

02:02:57.161 --> 02:03:00.539
Just pretend and
let's go away for a bit.

02:03:01.374 --> 02:03:02.458
This is what's best for him.

02:03:02.542 --> 02:03:04.710
Bodies were found
in the grove.

02:03:05.545 --> 02:03:07.338
It's all done
by Kim Byung-su.

02:03:07.422 --> 02:03:09.340
I'm pretty sure
Kim is the killer.

02:03:09.424 --> 02:03:12.343
I know. I've been suspicious
of him for a While.

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.928
He might turn himself in
if I talk nicely.

02:03:15.013 --> 02:03:17.807
You and Eun-hee can
persuade him to confess.

02:03:18.266 --> 02:03:20.518
<i>Confession doesn't make
any difference.</i>

02:03:21.394 --> 02:03:25.894
I'd regret if I don't give him
a chance to turn himself in.

02:03:28.443 --> 02:03:31.654
I used to come here often
with him for fishing,

02:03:31.779 --> 02:03:33.405
he's coming here soon.

02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:38.073
I've already requested backup too.

02:03:38.661 --> 02:03:43.161
If he resists,
then I'll make my move.

02:03:51.925 --> 02:03:53.134
Chief...

02:03:55.428 --> 02:03:55.970
Chief!

02:03:56.095 --> 02:04:00.595
People with dementia selectively
piece together their memories

02:04:01.476 --> 02:04:05.976
to attack the others
while protecting themselves.

02:04:09.692 --> 02:04:12.653
What do you want?

02:04:13.196 --> 02:04:15.239
I become you,

02:04:15.323 --> 02:04:17.616
you become me.

02:04:17.784 --> 02:04:20.036
Can murder charge stand
with dementia?

02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:22.246
It's gonna be hard.

02:04:22.664 --> 02:04:25.041
Prosecutor,
here's what you requested.

02:04:25.249 --> 02:04:28.210
A set of Kim Byung-su's
MRI and CT scan images.

02:04:28.586 --> 02:04:30.379
How hideous!

02:04:30.463 --> 02:04:33.048
There's one thing
that I really want to know.

02:04:33.216 --> 02:04:35.176
Tell me
how Min Tae-ju disappeared.

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:39.430
<i>He was last seen
near the reservoir...</i>

02:04:48.606 --> 02:04:52.568
ls this What
dementia should look like?

02:04:52.986 --> 02:04:54.862
How hideous!

02:04:59.075 --> 02:05:00.284
<i>Do not trust your memory.</i>
