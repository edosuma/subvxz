Whoever they are, you'll
never get your revenge now.

00:25.538 --> 00:27.272
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to win her back

00:27.307 --> 00:29.307
by proving you're not
the beast she thinks you are.

00:32.144 --> 00:34.145
Why do you keep ending up
in Vincent's arms?

00:34.180 --> 00:36.047
Look, Catherine,
are you with me?

00:36.082 --> 00:37.048
Or are you with him?

00:37.083 --> 00:38.049
We have to talk.

00:38.084 --> 00:39.383
Now that Sam's in jail,

03:03.769 --> 03:05.503
Break-up sex?

03:05.538 --> 03:07.372
Yes, that's a thing.
No, I know it's a thing.

03:07.406 --> 03:09.207
I'm just not convinced
it's your thing.

03:09.241 --> 03:10.675
What's that supposed to mean?

03:10.709 --> 03:12.477
Okay, maybe it was
break-up sex.

03:12.511 --> 03:14.712
But before I can make
that determination,

03:14.746 --> 03:17.181

Look, I'm just trying
to help you figure out

03:22.220 --> 03:23.420
what last night meant.

03:23.455 --> 03:24.755
All you have to do

03:24.790 --> 03:26.223
is answer a few questions.

03:26.257 --> 03:27.658
Was it good or bad?

03:27.693 --> 03:29.760
It was great.

03:29.795 --> 03:31.528
TESS:
<i>How great?</i>

03:31.563 --> 03:33.697
Very great.
So, there was kissing?

03:33.731 --> 03:35.065
Yes, there was kissing.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.400
Eye contact.

03:36.434 --> 03:37.534
Yes.
Okay, well, I hate

03:37.569 --> 03:39.069
to break it to you,

03:39.104 --> 03:40.704
but it doesn't sound
like break-up sex to me.

03:40.738 --> 03:41.771
Break-up sex is sloppy

03:41.806 --> 03:43.173
and short

03:43.208 --> 03:45.041
and generally not great.

03:46.478 --> 03:48.511
I mean, uh, that's what I heard.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.914
Or read. Online.

03:50.948 --> 03:52.115
Point is,

03:52.149 --> 03:54.084
you need to talk
to Cat, you know?

03:54.118 --> 03:55.752
Find out what it meant to her.
She walked out, man.

03:55.786 --> 03:57.453
She made it pretty clear
what it meant to her.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.188
Besides, she's with Gabe.

03:59.223 --> 04:00.556
She's not
wearing a ring.

04:00.591 --> 04:01.557
Is she?

04:01.592 --> 04:02.792
Look,

04:02.827 --> 04:03.860
all I'm saying is,

04:03.894 --> 04:04.960
you need answers.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.395
Vincent's gonna want answers.

04:06.430 --> 04:07.463
I'm more concerned about

04:07.498 --> 04:09.532
what I'm gonna say to Gabe.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.733
I feel like I
cheated on him.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.268
Okay, with all due
respect to Gabe,

04:12.302 --> 04:13.936
it's not like you
were living together.

04:13.970 --> 04:15.538
You didn't even
take his key.

04:15.572 --> 04:17.240
I mean, sure,
you owe him an explanation.

04:17.274 --> 04:19.108
But you have the right
to change your mind.

04:19.142 --> 04:20.909
I'm not changing my mind.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.544
She obviously hasn't
made up her mind yet.

04:22.578 --> 04:24.146
Besides, you
have every right

04:24.180 --> 04:25.547
to tell her how you feel.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.082
That it meant something to you.

04:27.117 --> 04:30.285
You're right.

04:30.319 --> 04:32.320
So, what are you waiting for?
Go talk to her.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.789
CATHERINE: <i>I don't want</i>

04:33.823 --> 04:34.823

04:35.959 --> 04:36.925
Tess, I thought I had

04:36.960 --> 04:38.226
this all figured out.

04:38.261 --> 04:39.594
I was gonna go over
there and tell him

04:39.629 --> 04:41.062
I was moving on
with Gabe, but...

04:41.096 --> 04:42.296
But your heart got in the way.

04:42.298 --> 04:43.831
My libido got in the way.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.100
That doesn't mean that I'm
gonna go back to Vincent.

04:46.135 --> 04:48.436
I have to move forward.
I know, but it's not

04:48.471 --> 04:51.239
like you're picking a shirt
here. This is your life.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.940
You need to take some time
to sort through your feelings.

04:52.975 --> 04:54.408
The good news is,

04:54.442 --> 04:55.977
with Sam in jail,
you don't have to worry

04:56.011 --> 04:58.612
about being around
either one of them for a while.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.784
Sam Landon?

05:02.818 --> 05:04.919
Yeah.

05:04.953 --> 05:06.788
Well, I'm not sure
why you vomited.

05:06.822 --> 05:08.622
But nothing's showing
up on your tests.

05:08.657 --> 05:10.991
So I'm sending you
back to gen pop.

05:12.894 --> 05:15.062
Be right back.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.005
Aah! What the hell?

05:25.873 --> 05:27.007
What did you do to me?

05:58.572 --> 05:59.739
to be around Gabe
for a while.

05:59.773 --> 06:01.140
No, I'm sure he's just here

06:01.174 --> 06:02.141

06:02.175 --> 06:04.576

06:16.289 --> 06:17.723
Good, good.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.190
Just, uh, crossing some Ts,

06:19.225 --> 06:20.659
dotting some Is
on Sam's case.

06:20.693 --> 06:22.093
Just want to make sure

06:22.128 --> 06:23.562
he's out of our lives for good

06:23.596 --> 06:25.397
so, uh, so we can all move on.

06:25.431 --> 06:27.165

06:27.199 --> 06:28.667
Catherine, do you mind if I talk

06:28.701 --> 06:30.001

06:30.035 --> 06:32.437
Yeah, of course.

06:38.210 --> 06:39.577
Look...

06:39.611 --> 06:40.745
Gabe, look, I'm sorry.

06:40.780 --> 06:41.913
For?

06:41.947 --> 06:43.414
I should have called
last night

06:43.448 --> 06:44.682
and I didn't.

06:44.716 --> 06:45.784
Why didn't you? Are you okay?

06:45.818 --> 06:47.051
Did something happen?

06:47.086 --> 06:49.420
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

06:49.454 --> 06:50.588
'Cause you left to talk
to Vincent, and then...

06:50.622 --> 06:51.722
I know, uh, but...

06:51.757 --> 06:52.723
So, did you?

06:54.593 --> 06:57.295
What, is this an interrogation?

06:57.329 --> 07:00.230
No. Look, I know,

07:00.265 --> 07:02.633
given your relationship
with Vincent,

07:02.668 --> 07:05.202
this can't be an
easy thing to do.

07:05.236 --> 07:06.870
Still, I-I thought
you were going to tell him,

07:06.905 --> 07:09.206
and I was just wondering
if you did, that's all.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.042
I intended to.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.144
I did, but, um...

07:14.179 --> 07:15.279
Are you having second thoughts
about us?

07:15.313 --> 07:18.448
No. No.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.117
Yes.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.721
I don't know.

07:24.755 --> 07:27.457
TESS:
I'm sorry, guys.

07:27.491 --> 07:29.559
Tess, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

07:29.593 --> 07:32.495

it in somehow,

07:51.369 --> 07:53.637
and that inmate's going
to die unless JT gets here

07:53.671 --> 07:55.639

Okay, I'll call JT.

07:55.673 --> 07:58.107
While you're at it, check and
see if he's made any progress

07:58.142 --> 07:59.476
on breaking the
encryption code

07:59.510 --> 08:01.043
on that flash drive
we found with Sam.

08:01.078 --> 08:02.312
Whoever he thinks killed his son

08:02.346 --> 08:04.013
has got to be on that thing.

08:04.047 --> 08:05.682
But he didn't have a chance
to get anything off it

08:05.716 --> 08:07.150
or the CIA server
before we caught him.

08:07.184 --> 08:10.219
Maybe he backed it up
to a cloud or something?

08:10.254 --> 08:13.355
All I know is Sam was hell-bent
on breaking out of prison,

08:13.390 --> 08:14.957
and that could only be
for one reason--

08:14.992 --> 08:16.492
to get revenge for his son.

08:16.526 --> 08:18.194
And God only knows
what he has planned

08:18.228 --> 08:19.862
considering all the carnage
he's caused already.

08:19.897 --> 08:21.964
I can't believe
we have to catch this guy again.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.866
We'll get him.
Thought we already did.

08:23.901 --> 08:25.901
Thought this was
all behind us.

08:25.935 --> 08:28.671

08:44.287 --> 08:45.854
No, wait, I got
to talk to you, okay,

08:45.888 --> 08:47.422
right now, about last night.

08:47.456 --> 08:49.324
It's not a good time.
Let me call you back.

08:49.358 --> 08:51.827
No, wait, please.
I just... I need to know.

08:51.861 --> 08:53.061
Why did you leave?

08:53.095 --> 08:54.696
Vincent, last night was...

08:54.730 --> 08:56.264
Incredible.
No, I was

08:56.299 --> 08:57.866
gonna say, it was a mistake.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.999
(scoffs)

08:59.034 --> 09:00.435
Come on, it wasn't a mistake.

09:00.469 --> 09:02.537
I mean, it felt pretty real
to me, right?

09:02.571 --> 09:04.038
It must have meant something?

09:04.072 --> 09:06.441
No. It was break-up sex,
that's all.

09:06.475 --> 09:09.009
You don't really believe that,
do you?

09:09.044 --> 09:10.445
Yes, I do.

09:10.479 --> 09:12.347
No, you don't.
I can tell, all right?

09:12.381 --> 09:14.248
I can sense when you're lying,
even over the phone.

09:14.282 --> 09:15.582
Okay, that's not fair.

09:15.616 --> 09:17.284
Listen, I am with Gabe now,

09:17.319 --> 09:19.019
and that means that last night
can't happen again.

09:19.054 --> 09:21.521
Why not?
Because I can't go backwards.

09:21.556 --> 09:23.623
That's why not.
I can't go back to having

09:23.658 --> 09:25.292
my life solely defined by you.

09:25.327 --> 09:27.461

and covering for you.

09:27.495 --> 09:28.929
That time is over.

09:28.964 --> 09:30.565
Catherine, come on.
You know we are meant

09:30.598 --> 09:31.965
to be together.
You know it, I know it.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.267
Okay, point is,
I won't go backwards.

09:34.301 --> 09:35.635
I won't make you.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.070
Yeah, and neither will Gabe.

09:37.104 --> 09:40.407
Look, I have to go.
I have to call Tess.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.642
Sam-- he escaped from Rikers.

09:42.677 --> 09:44.944
What? When did that happen?
This morning.

09:44.979 --> 09:47.046
He injected an inmate
with beast serum.

09:47.081 --> 09:48.614
Okay, look,
I'll get you an antidote.

09:48.648 --> 09:50.250
I'll get onto JT right away,
okay?

09:50.284 --> 09:52.785
Thank you.
Look, I have to go.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.888
Wait. Catherine, uh,

09:54.922 --> 09:57.924
you know I'm not gonna
give up on us, right?

09:57.958 --> 09:59.392
(clears throat)

09:59.426 --> 10:00.960
(phone beeps off)

10:00.995 --> 10:02.661
You ready?
Yeah.

10:08.435 --> 10:10.235
(door opens)

10:10.270 --> 10:11.604
Hey, sorry to barge in,
but Sam...

10:11.638 --> 10:13.071
Sam escaped, I know.

10:13.106 --> 10:15.340
Vincent called,
he's on his way over.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.675
Vincent-- how did he know?

10:16.710 --> 10:19.111
Cat told him.
Cat-- they spoke?

10:19.145 --> 10:20.613
Yeah. Why not?

10:22.148 --> 10:24.349
Never mind. Look,
I need you to help us find Sam.

10:24.384 --> 10:26.285
Preferably before he
creates another beast

10:26.319 --> 10:27.920
or, you know, blows up another
building or kidnaps one of us.

10:27.954 --> 10:29.687
What do you think I'm doing?

10:29.722 --> 10:32.824
No. No. No. Not who
he's after, where he is.

10:32.858 --> 10:35.427
Fire up that, you know, that
fancy facial recognition

10:35.461 --> 10:37.029
software you got.
Let's go.

10:37.063 --> 10:39.464
It's actually not mine,
it's Homeland Security's,

10:39.498 --> 10:41.766
and if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not tap into...

10:41.801 --> 10:42.867
Really?

10:42.902 --> 10:44.636
That's where this is going?
Yeah.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.404
(clears throat)

10:50.008 --> 10:51.976
So, talk to Cat today, did you?

10:52.010 --> 10:54.845
Maybe. You talk to Vincent?

10:54.879 --> 10:56.880
Maybe.

10:58.817 --> 11:00.784
How could she
do that to him?

11:00.819 --> 11:02.453
How could she just leave
without saying a word?

11:02.487 --> 11:03.988
Okay. Down, boy.

11:04.022 --> 11:05.389
If a dude left in the
middle of the night,

11:05.424 --> 11:07.724
it would be standard
operating procedure.

11:07.759 --> 11:09.393
But for Cat,
it's a capital offense?

11:09.428 --> 11:11.294
Don't make this a gender thing.

11:11.329 --> 11:13.864
Well, maybe she just needed
time to think, to process.

11:13.898 --> 11:16.066
How would you feel if the woman
you'd been chasing for months

11:16.100 --> 11:18.001
slept with you,
then just disappeared?

11:18.035 --> 11:21.371
Are you talking about Cat
and Vincent or you and me?

11:21.405 --> 11:23.474
(door opens)
Hey.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.375
How's that antidote
coming along?

11:25.409 --> 11:26.910
Uh, it's cooking.

11:26.945 --> 11:28.244
TESS: And I'm leaving.
Look, just let me know

11:28.279 --> 11:29.712
as soon as you get a hit on Sam.

11:29.746 --> 11:30.713
Yes, ma'am.

11:30.747 --> 11:32.449
(sighs)

11:35.719 --> 11:38.054
What was that about?

11:38.089 --> 11:39.555
Women.

11:39.590 --> 11:41.191
So, did you get any answers?

11:41.225 --> 11:42.993
Well, none that I liked.

11:43.027 --> 11:45.160
Somehow I got to show Catherine
that getting back with me

11:45.195 --> 11:47.830
is not going backwards for her.

11:47.865 --> 11:49.331
What does that even mean?
It means (sighs)

11:49.366 --> 11:51.767
I got to prove to her
I'm not the same jackass

11:51.802 --> 11:53.870
that took the law into
my own hands with her father.

11:53.904 --> 11:55.838
But first we got to
help her find Sam.

11:55.873 --> 11:57.907
So, I'll take surveillance,

11:57.941 --> 11:59.876
you take the antidote.
Yeah, but I, uh...

11:59.910 --> 12:01.743
(crashes)

12:01.777 --> 12:03.379
(typing)

12:03.413 --> 12:05.047
(siren wailing)

12:05.081 --> 12:07.249
(car horns honking)

12:07.283 --> 12:09.284
(phone ringing in distance)

12:16.226 --> 12:18.192
(gun clicks)

12:18.227 --> 12:20.194
Who are you?

12:20.229 --> 12:21.730
What do you want?

12:21.764 --> 12:22.731
What do I want?

12:22.765 --> 12:24.465
I want justice.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.902
That's what I want.
For my son.

12:26.936 --> 12:29.137
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:29.171 --> 12:31.472
You thought you were
untouchable, didn't you, Judge?

12:31.507 --> 12:33.227
You thought no one knew
who you really were.

12:33.242 --> 12:34.875
But I found you.

12:34.910 --> 12:37.245
I found all of you.

12:37.279 --> 12:38.913
(panting)

12:38.947 --> 12:40.281
Where's the pin?

12:40.315 --> 12:42.250
Pin? What pin?

12:42.284 --> 12:44.785
(gun cocks) Don't play games with me,
Westbrook.

12:44.819 --> 12:46.421
I know about you
and your secret group.

12:46.455 --> 12:49.257
How you communicate
only through encrypted files.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.992
And how you respond
if there's a security breach.

12:52.761 --> 12:53.761
Sit down.

12:54.963 --> 12:56.864
The server, the explosion.

12:58.266 --> 12:59.567
That was you?

12:59.601 --> 13:02.836
Last time, where's the pin?

13:02.871 --> 13:05.940
If you know who they are,
you know why I can't talk.

13:05.974 --> 13:07.507
You'll kill me...

13:07.542 --> 13:08.975
they'll kill my entire family.

13:09.009 --> 13:11.278
(panting)

13:18.486 --> 13:20.153
(both grunt)

13:21.556 --> 13:23.957
♪

13:31.364 --> 13:33.700
♪

13:42.576 --> 13:43.842
You're mad.

13:43.876 --> 13:45.677
No. I'm not.

13:45.712 --> 13:48.547
I'm just, uh...
I'm disappointed.

13:48.582 --> 13:51.617
But you are allowed
to change your mind.

13:51.651 --> 13:54.019
I haven't changed my mind.

13:54.053 --> 13:55.821
I want to make this
work, I do, but I...

13:55.855 --> 13:56.989
If you're looking
for guarantees,

13:57.023 --> 13:58.523
there aren't any.

13:58.557 --> 14:00.525
Okay, there is no way
to be sure

14:00.559 --> 14:02.460
that it could
work out between us.

14:02.495 --> 14:03.629
Unless you take the leap.

14:03.663 --> 14:05.030
Unless we both do.

14:05.064 --> 14:06.798
Now, I thought that you were
ready to try, but...

14:06.833 --> 14:07.866
I was...

14:09.368 --> 14:11.670
I want to be, but maybe...

14:11.704 --> 14:14.339
I don't know, maybe
I'm not as ready as I thought.

14:14.373 --> 14:16.174
It's better
to be honest

14:16.208 --> 14:17.509
than pretend, right?

14:17.543 --> 14:19.144
And-and-and I don't
want to pressure you

14:19.178 --> 14:21.298
into doing something that
you're not ready for, but...

14:23.015 --> 14:24.516
I love you, Catherine.

14:24.550 --> 14:26.684
And in my heart, I know

14:26.718 --> 14:28.186
that I am the right guy for you.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.922
Just like I know that
Vincent is bad for you, he is.

14:31.957 --> 14:33.157
I think you know that.

14:33.191 --> 14:34.525
And you deserve better.

14:34.559 --> 14:36.961
I'm not giving up
without a fight.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.777
Okay, the antidote
is done, dude.

14:47.811 --> 14:49.178
How's it coming
with the surveillance?

14:49.213 --> 14:50.846
The city is just
too damn big, man.

14:50.881 --> 14:53.616
We got to find a way
to narrow this down somehow.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.984
And you still
can't track him?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.485
No. Sam's smart.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.054
He's probably using
scent killers or something.

14:59.088 --> 15:03.058
Damn it. I can't believe we're
trying to find this guy again.

15:03.092 --> 15:05.561
Seriously, it's like playing
Whac-A-Mole with him.

15:05.595 --> 15:07.396
Guy breaks out of prison,
he means business, but...

15:07.431 --> 15:10.065
how are you supposed to stop him
if you can never find him?

15:10.099 --> 15:13.302
Yeah, it's kind of hard
to keep moving forward

15:13.336 --> 15:15.203
when he keeps pulling
you backwards, too.

15:15.238 --> 15:17.239
Yeah. That, too.

15:17.273 --> 15:19.241
(sighs)

15:19.275 --> 15:20.675
JT:
Hey, maybe we can

15:20.709 --> 15:21.876
narrow it down.

15:21.911 --> 15:22.978
How?

15:23.012 --> 15:24.079
Sam's flash drive.

15:24.113 --> 15:25.647
I was working on decrypting it,

15:25.681 --> 15:27.049
well, at least until I got

15:27.083 --> 15:28.983
two new things on
my honey-do list.

15:29.017 --> 15:32.219
Didn't find names, per se,
but I did find some addresses.

15:32.254 --> 15:33.555
Eight to be exact.

15:33.589 --> 15:35.757
Oh, in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

15:35.791 --> 15:37.859
It's... They're all over the country.
But there are two

15:37.893 --> 15:40.728
in Manhattan, and the closest
is 22nd and Broadway.

15:40.763 --> 15:43.531
Sam went to a lot of trouble
to get this list, which means

15:43.566 --> 15:45.767
whoever belongs to these
addresses has to have something

15:45.800 --> 15:47.768
to do with his son's death.
Right. 22nd

15:47.802 --> 15:49.270
and Broadway.

15:49.304 --> 15:52.506
All right, there's
a camera at 23rd.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.943
JT:
Okay, hit high-speed rewind.

15:55.978 --> 15:58.245
There, stop.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.913
Here, let me zoom in.

16:02.817 --> 16:03.948
That's him.

16:03.973 --> 16:05.652
Time stamp's less than
20 minutes ago.

16:05.653 --> 16:07.554
Call Catherine. Tell her
to meet me there, okay?

16:07.589 --> 16:09.222
And get the antidote
to Rikers.

16:10.257 --> 16:12.125
You're welcome.

16:12.159 --> 16:15.696
(car horns honking)

16:15.730 --> 16:17.564
Here you go.
(groans) Thank you.

16:20.634 --> 16:23.324
He seems pretty shaken. Any sign
of Sam when you first got here?

16:23.670 --> 16:25.705
Please tell me you didn't use your beast
powers to track him here,

16:25.739 --> 16:27.907
'cause I can't very well explain
how we found him if you did.

16:27.941 --> 16:29.976
VINCENT: Relax, okay? I used
facial recognition software

16:30.011 --> 16:32.445
and surveillance cameras.
Great.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.314
Tapped into Homeland
Security again, did we?

16:34.348 --> 16:36.148
Yes, I did, okay?

16:36.182 --> 16:37.717
But it was
Tess' idea, so...

16:37.751 --> 16:39.318
You can't break the
law to make the law...

16:39.352 --> 16:41.821
Okay, can we just focus
on what's important

16:41.855 --> 16:43.455
right now, which is finding Sam?

16:43.490 --> 16:44.724
What she said.

16:44.758 --> 16:46.225
Well?

16:46.259 --> 16:48.460
Well, he was long gone
before I got here.

16:48.495 --> 16:49.729
So we've got nothing.

16:49.763 --> 16:51.230
We got him.

16:51.264 --> 16:52.898
Yeah, except he isn't talking
right now.

16:52.932 --> 16:56.001
Well, he's a federal judge.
He knows his rights.

16:56.036 --> 16:58.270
No, he's hiding something.
How do you know?

16:58.304 --> 17:00.672
Because, Gabe,
I can sense it.

17:00.706 --> 17:03.275
Yeah, let me see
what I can find out.

17:03.309 --> 17:05.310
Catherine...

17:05.345 --> 17:06.578
Vincent, not now.

17:06.612 --> 17:07.811
When?
Later.

17:07.847 --> 17:08.847
We really
need your help

17:08.881 --> 17:10.314
finding
Sam Landon.

17:10.348 --> 17:12.116
He is a dangerous man
and we have to find him

17:12.151 --> 17:13.617
before he hurts anybody else.

17:15.054 --> 17:16.521
I wish I could help.

17:16.556 --> 17:18.289
Can you at least tell me

17:18.323 --> 17:19.523
why he broke into your office?

17:19.559 --> 17:21.425
I don't know.

17:21.460 --> 17:22.961
No, he's lying.
Vincent...

17:22.994 --> 17:24.762
So you're saying

17:24.796 --> 17:26.097
this was completely random?

17:26.131 --> 17:27.131
Yes.

17:27.165 --> 17:28.532
Lying again.

17:32.071 --> 17:33.771
So, what did he want?
He take anything?

17:33.805 --> 17:35.839
No, not that I'm aware of.

17:35.874 --> 17:37.141
Uh-uh.
Not true.

17:37.176 --> 17:38.209
Vincent...
Do you mind?

17:38.243 --> 17:39.210
Sorry.

17:39.244 --> 17:41.812
He's a profiler.

17:41.846 --> 17:43.047
Okay, you
aren't helping.

17:43.081 --> 17:44.347
And he is wasting
our time.

17:46.751 --> 17:49.086
GABE:
Sidebar.

17:52.423 --> 17:53.657
VINCENT: All right, so
what's happening?

17:53.692 --> 17:54.892
This isn't
working.

17:54.926 --> 17:56.159
Right, well...

17:56.194 --> 17:57.561
I'd better take it
from here, then.

17:57.595 --> 17:59.362
I meant, it's not
working with you.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.333
Oh, well, you're the one

18:03.367 --> 18:04.901
who's not getting
anywhere with him.

18:04.935 --> 18:06.570
It takes time
to interview a witness.

18:06.604 --> 18:07.637
We don't have
time, okay?

18:07.671 --> 18:09.072
Sam is on the loose

18:09.107 --> 18:10.407
and this judge knows
where he's going.

18:10.441 --> 18:11.575
How can you be so sure?

18:11.609 --> 18:13.243
Because he's terrified.

18:13.277 --> 18:14.811
His heart rate is
off the charts.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.145
He's just been attacked.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.680
That's not why
he's terrified, okay?

18:17.715 --> 18:19.515
It's something else,
something that both he

18:19.549 --> 18:21.250
and Sam know about,
something to do with

18:21.284 --> 18:22.685
those addresses.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.186
And if we're gonna
find out about it,

18:24.221 --> 18:25.888
then I'm gonna have
to do the interview.

18:25.923 --> 18:28.625
How? What can you do
that I can't do?

18:32.028 --> 18:33.529
(snarls)

18:33.563 --> 18:34.696
(screaming)

18:34.731 --> 18:37.600
(scream echoes)

18:39.236 --> 18:40.603
TESS: I was just coming up,
how'd it go?

18:40.637 --> 18:42.037
Bad.
Good.

18:42.071 --> 18:44.206
Well, which is it?
Good and bad.

18:44.241 --> 18:46.342
Vincent got Judge Westbrook
to talk, but...

18:46.376 --> 18:47.509
But he had to beast out
in front of him to do it.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.877
What were you
thinking?

18:48.911 --> 18:51.346
I was thinking about
finding Sam, Gabe.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.447
You're not worried
about what Westbrook's

18:52.481 --> 18:53.682
gonna say about you now?

18:53.716 --> 18:55.416
What, that he saw
some big, bad beast?

18:55.451 --> 18:57.119
I mean, really, who's
gonna believe that?

18:57.153 --> 18:59.287
Now, obviously the guy's
got a lot more problems

18:59.321 --> 19:01.957
than me, so I'm not too
worried about my future.

19:01.991 --> 19:04.025
Well, what else is new?

19:04.059 --> 19:06.927
Anyway, now we know why Sam
attacked Judge Westbrook.

19:06.962 --> 19:10.231
Yeah, apparently Westbrook is
part of this secret society,

19:10.266 --> 19:12.600
a bunch of power brokers
whose identities

19:12.635 --> 19:14.602
he's gonna keep secret
with his life.

19:14.637 --> 19:16.371
We think that Sam

19:16.405 --> 19:17.972
holds one of the people
from that organization

19:18.006 --> 19:19.607
responsible for what
happened to his son.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.108
So, wait, what
are you saying?

19:21.143 --> 19:22.543
That one of them was
trying to make a beast

19:22.577 --> 19:23.944
and experimented
on his kid?

19:23.979 --> 19:26.781
Wow. It doesn't get
more evil than that.

19:26.815 --> 19:29.583
It would explain everything
Sam's done to get to this point,

19:29.617 --> 19:31.752
to get his revenge.
Problem is,

19:31.787 --> 19:33.587
according
to Westbrook,

19:33.621 --> 19:35.556
these members, they don't actually
know who each other are.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.157
They only communicate
through some

19:37.192 --> 19:39.426
CIA server which
Sam blew up.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.928
Which triggered an emergency
meeting at some charity event

19:41.962 --> 19:44.231
which Sam can now attend
because he has the pin.

19:44.265 --> 19:45.666
Pin? What pin?

19:45.700 --> 19:47.401
Hey, did JT
get a name

19:47.435 --> 19:48.735
on that other Manhattan address?

19:48.769 --> 19:50.637
Yeah.

19:50.672 --> 19:51.905
A Mr. and
Mrs. Beaumont,

19:51.939 --> 19:53.139
Upper East Side
industrialists. Why?

19:53.174 --> 19:54.407
What are you thinking?

19:54.441 --> 19:55.641
I'm thinking we pay

19:55.676 --> 19:56.910
Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont a visit.

19:56.944 --> 19:58.344
Maybe borrow their secret pins,

19:58.378 --> 20:00.113
pay Sam a visit
at his little party.

20:00.147 --> 20:02.415
So, would you care to join me,
Mrs. Beaumont?

20:02.449 --> 20:04.984
Wait, what?
Well, obviously the members

20:05.019 --> 20:06.252
don't know what the Beaumonts
look like, right?

20:06.286 --> 20:08.286
But they know that they're
married, which is why...

20:08.288 --> 20:10.489
I will go to the party
with Catherine.

20:11.525 --> 20:13.025
Why you?

20:13.059 --> 20:14.660
Well, number one,
I am the ADA.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.295
I can hold them
without cause

20:16.330 --> 20:17.697
and make them hand
over their pins

20:17.731 --> 20:18.964
without
beasting out.

20:18.998 --> 20:20.132
And number
two...

20:20.166 --> 20:22.335
she's with me.

20:22.369 --> 20:24.169
Is she?
Are you?

20:24.204 --> 20:25.705
Okay.
This is ridiculous.

20:25.739 --> 20:27.005
Pick a number
between one and ten.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.273
Really?
Yes, hurry.

20:28.307 --> 20:30.175
Seven.
Three.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.443
Okay, seven.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.478
Let's go.

20:36.983 --> 20:39.051
I was gonna say seven.

20:42.479 --> 20:44.480
(elegant piano music playing)

20:46.416 --> 20:48.945
Well, I get why we couldn't
just storm the place.

20:49.385 --> 20:50.618
That's a lot of security.

20:50.652 --> 20:51.987
All kinds, too,

20:52.021 --> 20:53.821
if the guest list
is any indication.

20:53.856 --> 20:56.024
Judges, senators,
tycoons.

20:56.058 --> 20:57.692
It's built-in security for
Westbrook's secret group

20:57.726 --> 20:59.527
to hold their
emergency meeting.

20:59.561 --> 21:02.129
Question is, how do we figure
out which one Sam's after?

21:02.163 --> 21:03.330
And how do
we stop Sam...

21:03.365 --> 21:04.431
May I offer you
a drink, sir?

21:04.466 --> 21:06.100
No, thank you.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.235
(English accent):
I almost forgot.

21:10.472 --> 21:11.606
What's the matter,
Mrs. Beaumont?

21:11.640 --> 21:12.673
You forget you were married?

21:12.708 --> 21:14.308
(English accent):
Oh, um...

21:14.342 --> 21:15.809
I did, Mr. Beaumont.
Apologies.

21:15.843 --> 21:17.478
Accepted.

21:18.913 --> 21:21.448
Come on, let's
find our bad guy.

21:21.483 --> 21:24.218
CATHERINE: Yeah, that's gonna be a little
harder than we thought.

21:24.252 --> 21:26.353
It's a masquerade party,

21:26.388 --> 21:29.289
and it's one we've been to before.
So?

21:29.324 --> 21:31.204
So, what if someone
recognizes us from last year

21:31.225 --> 21:33.226
as not being
the Beaumonts?

21:33.260 --> 21:35.395
And more specifically,
what if they recognize you?

21:35.429 --> 21:37.130
You're more
high-profile than me.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.298
I'm an ADA.
I'm hardly high-profile.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.734
Besides, we'll be
wearing masks...

21:40.768 --> 21:42.869
Hey, Lowan, long time.

21:42.904 --> 21:44.170
Let's catch up.
Hi, Gabe.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.306
Hi.

21:47.341 --> 21:50.543
Okay, so what do we do now?

21:52.612 --> 21:56.182
I take it this is your second marriage,
Mrs. Beaumont?

21:56.216 --> 21:57.583
Very funny.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.985
You're looking
very beautiful tonight.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.854
Vincent, stop trying
to charm me.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.256
This is about
Sam, not us.

22:03.290 --> 22:04.990
Well, why can't
it be about us?

22:05.025 --> 22:06.491
And why can't this
be our future?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.694
We don't have a
future, Vincent.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.596
Who told you that-- Gabe?

22:10.630 --> 22:12.097
Yeah, where
is that guy?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.533
We're looking
for Sam, not Gabe.

22:14.568 --> 22:16.435
And this isn't the place
to talk about us.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.536
Why not?

22:19.039 --> 22:20.705
Doesn't this all seem
vaguely familiar?

22:20.739 --> 22:22.240
Last year,
masks,

22:22.275 --> 22:24.209
us after a bad guy...
you remember?

22:24.243 --> 22:25.743
I do, I remember.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.279
I remember us kissing,

22:27.313 --> 22:28.547
and I remember...
Okay, that's...

22:28.581 --> 22:30.415
that's the problem,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.285
it feels like the past,
and that's what scares me.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.220
Look, I don't want
to go backward, Vincent.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.955
And I know that you're
trying to change,

22:36.989 --> 22:38.790
but I'm scared it won't last.
Catherine,

22:38.824 --> 22:40.592
I have changed, okay?
We both have.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.426
The one thing that
hasn't changed, that will never change,

22:42.461 --> 22:44.428
is that we are better together

22:44.463 --> 22:46.497
than we are apart,
and you know it.

22:48.266 --> 22:49.934
Wait. If last night
meant anything to you,

22:49.969 --> 22:53.237
you will give us
one more chance.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.038
We have to
split up.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.640
What?

22:56.674 --> 22:58.875
To find Sam,

22:58.910 --> 23:01.579
to arrest him.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.149
(sighs)

23:05.183 --> 23:06.817
Why is she so beautiful?

23:06.851 --> 23:08.486
♪

23:31.442 --> 23:33.476
(typing)

23:33.511 --> 23:35.178
What is taking
so long?

23:35.212 --> 23:36.446
Are you kidding?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.515
This is NSA-level decryption.

23:38.549 --> 23:41.083
It's amazing I got
anything at all so far.

23:41.118 --> 23:42.952
Okay, get over yourself, JT.
We need names, all right?

23:42.986 --> 23:44.954
Specifically, the one
in particular that Sam's after.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.421
'Cause if Cat and Gabe
can't find Sam...

23:46.456 --> 23:48.090
They need to find his target

23:48.125 --> 23:49.825
so they can protect him instead,
I know. I'm trying.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.927
Well, can't you
try any harder?

23:51.962 --> 23:54.697
Excuse me, I had to write
a completely new algorithm

23:54.731 --> 23:56.365
comparing 3,000 variables.

23:56.399 --> 23:58.000
Do you have any idea
how complex that is?

23:58.035 --> 24:00.602
I just want to know
how long it's gonna take.

24:00.637 --> 24:02.604
Oh, so now you want answers.

24:02.639 --> 24:03.839
What is that supposed to mean?

24:03.873 --> 24:05.774
Nothing.

24:05.808 --> 24:07.209
No.

24:07.243 --> 24:09.244
Come on, you started it,
what does that mean?

24:10.346 --> 24:11.547
Okay, fine.

24:11.581 --> 24:13.182
I sent you
flowers.

24:13.216 --> 24:15.284
We spent the night
in a hotel together,

24:15.318 --> 24:17.052
but you act like nothing ever
happened and I don't like it.

24:17.086 --> 24:19.220
You don't.
No, I don't.

24:19.254 --> 24:20.855
I think I deserve more.

24:20.890 --> 24:23.524
I think I deserve
an answer from you.

24:23.559 --> 24:26.127
Did that mean anything to you,
or didn't it?

24:26.162 --> 24:28.029
Okay, you really want to know?

24:28.064 --> 24:29.831
Yeah, I do.

24:29.865 --> 24:31.465
Okay, well, the truth is,

24:31.500 --> 24:33.201
you're the last person
on the planet

24:33.235 --> 24:34.556
I ever pictured myself
being with.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.404
You are not my
type at all.

24:36.438 --> 24:38.706
Which is why every time
we come closer together,

24:38.740 --> 24:39.973
I have to
pull away,

24:40.008 --> 24:41.475
because this does
not make sense,

24:41.510 --> 24:42.710
it shouldn't work.

24:42.744 --> 24:44.044
But then, when
we're apart,

24:44.079 --> 24:45.879
all I do is think
about being with you

24:45.914 --> 24:47.915

freakin' nuts!

Bad news-- JT doesn't think
Sam's going after one member

25:48.408 --> 25:51.109
of the organization; he thinks
he's going after all of them.

25:51.144 --> 25:53.646
Uh, okay, how does
he know this?

25:53.680 --> 25:55.080
Because when JT decrypted
Sam's flash drive,

25:55.114 --> 25:56.314
he found out that
the organization

25:56.348 --> 25:58.150
was actually behind Muirfield.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.418
Muirfield's just the tip of
the iceberg for these guys.

26:00.452 --> 26:01.787
They've got their
hands in companies,

26:01.821 --> 26:03.121
medical trials, experiments,

26:03.156 --> 26:04.722
all working towards one thing.

26:04.757 --> 26:05.891
Creating beasts.

26:05.925 --> 26:06.892
The ultimate weapon

26:06.926 --> 26:07.893
for power players who want

26:07.927 --> 26:08.927
to control anything.

26:08.961 --> 26:09.961
Even at the expense

26:09.996 --> 26:11.562
of a young boy's life, huh?

26:11.597 --> 26:12.797
At the expense of
anybody's life.

26:12.831 --> 26:14.064
They obviously don't care.

26:14.099 --> 26:15.300
Can't say that I blame Sam

26:15.334 --> 26:16.734
for what he wants
to do to them.

26:16.769 --> 26:17.735
Yeah, well, I agree.

26:17.770 --> 26:18.736
But we can't let him be

26:18.771 --> 26:19.837
judge, jury and executioner.

26:19.871 --> 26:20.971
Now, can we?

26:21.006 --> 26:23.107
(laughs)

26:23.141 --> 26:24.241
What?

26:24.276 --> 26:26.611
Look, you can try and fool

26:26.645 --> 26:28.745
Catherine with that crap,
but you can't fool me.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.347
Excuse me?
I know you want to change,

26:30.381 --> 26:32.516
Vincent, and I know
why you want to change.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.118
But you can't.

26:34.152 --> 26:36.187
Is that so, Gabe?

26:36.221 --> 26:38.355
Do yourself a favor.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.057
Stay away from Catherine.

26:55.206 --> 26:57.040
(grunting)

27:06.917 --> 27:08.651
Ooh.

27:08.685 --> 27:10.019
Are you out of your mind?

27:10.054 --> 27:11.620
What were you thinking?
What do you mean?

27:11.655 --> 27:12.889
You were in trouble.
I was just trying to help.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.224
No, I had this
perfectly under control.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.491
My control.

27:16.894 --> 27:18.961
You obviously haven't
changed at all.

27:18.995 --> 27:20.963
I'm not some damsel in distress.

27:20.997 --> 27:23.131
I don't need a knight
in shining armor.

27:23.166 --> 27:25.401
(huffs)

27:25.435 --> 27:28.871
Change, huh? I'll show you
change, Catherine Chandler.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.709
I've been looking
all over for you.

27:43.736 --> 27:45.037
Where you been?
Don't ask.

27:45.071 --> 27:46.104
Hey, I still don't understand

27:46.139 --> 27:47.706
what I did wrong.
Yeah, exactly.

27:47.740 --> 27:48.907
Did something happen?

27:48.941 --> 27:50.508
Yes.
No.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.509
Have you seen Sam?

27:51.544 --> 27:52.510
Before I could grab him,

27:52.545 --> 27:53.845
he got onto a private elevator

27:53.880 --> 27:56.048
with a few other guests
wearing pins.

27:56.082 --> 27:57.949
Whatever his plan is,
it's going down now.

28:12.798 --> 28:15.366
Andrew Martin?

28:15.401 --> 28:16.934
Right?

28:16.968 --> 28:19.571
Yes.

28:19.605 --> 28:21.406
Do you remember those
so-called clinical trials

28:21.440 --> 28:22.707
we did on sick kids

28:22.741 --> 28:24.575
about six years ago?

28:24.609 --> 28:26.110
Of course.

28:26.144 --> 28:28.212
Including a boy named Adam?

28:28.246 --> 28:31.882
And who are you?

28:31.917 --> 28:33.650
That was all your idea,
wasn't it?

28:36.822 --> 28:38.322
Aah!

28:38.356 --> 28:39.989
MAN:
What are you...?

28:41.192 --> 28:43.059
What did you do?

28:43.094 --> 28:45.596
What you wanted to do to my son.

28:47.798 --> 28:49.099
MAN:
Is he all right?

28:49.133 --> 28:50.133
Maybe should we call...?

28:50.167 --> 28:52.135

28:53.804 --> 28:55.972
Kill them all.

29:04.514 --> 29:05.648
All right,
wherever they're meeting,

29:05.682 --> 29:06.950
that's the only way in.

29:06.984 --> 29:08.785
All right, let's go.

29:08.819 --> 29:10.019
Wait, you can't.
You don't know

29:10.054 --> 29:11.320
what you're getting
into up there.

29:11.355 --> 29:12.988
Other than Sam
wants to kill everyone.

29:13.022 --> 29:14.790
That's why we're here.
To try and stop that.

29:14.824 --> 29:16.325
Yeah, but we were supposed
to try and stop him

29:16.360 --> 29:17.493
down here
before it was too late.

29:17.527 --> 29:18.628
It's not too late.

29:18.662 --> 29:19.862
Vincent, he just armed

29:19.896 --> 29:20.963
an innocent man
with a suicide vest

29:20.997 --> 29:22.431
a couple of days ago.

29:22.466 --> 29:24.267
How do we know he's not
wearing one right now?

29:24.301 --> 29:25.668
How else is he going
to kill everyone?

29:25.702 --> 29:26.869
So, what are you saying?

29:26.903 --> 29:28.303
We just let him
get away with it?

29:28.337 --> 29:29.972
I'm saying it's
not just your life

29:30.006 --> 29:31.240
you're risking here, Vincent.

29:32.742 --> 29:35.210
Let's go.

29:35.245 --> 29:38.147

decisions for Catherine.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.079
(elevator dings)

30:12.114 --> 30:14.748
Sam, what are you doing?

30:14.783 --> 30:16.050
Finishing what they started.

30:16.084 --> 30:17.718
And making sure
that no one leaves.

30:17.752 --> 30:19.653
Which now includes you.

30:19.688 --> 30:20.854
(growling, screaming nearby)

30:20.888 --> 30:21.888
All right.

30:25.927 --> 30:27.260
Sam, what's going on?

30:27.295 --> 30:29.229
Guess why he experimented
on my son.

30:30.765 --> 30:33.200
He's predisposed, too.

30:33.234 --> 30:35.274
He's gonna kill them all
just like he killed my boy.

30:36.403 --> 30:38.438
Um...
Yeah.

30:38.472 --> 30:40.406
(both growling)

30:43.777 --> 30:45.545
Gabe, pull the fire alarm.

30:45.579 --> 30:47.247
Make sure you get
everyone out of here.

(crowd clamoring)

30:58.625 --> 31:00.560
Tess, we need backup now.

31:00.594 --> 31:03.295
(growling)

31:03.330 --> 31:04.797
You're gonna be okay.

31:04.832 --> 31:06.599
(grunting)

31:06.633 --> 31:08.334
Aah!

31:11.972 --> 31:13.072
(growls)

31:13.106 --> 31:14.173
No!

31:23.316 --> 31:25.283
Okay, hold this,
put pressure on it.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.918
Okay?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.676
Sam, don't do it.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.778
Stay away.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.280
It won't bring him back.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.314
I said stay away!

32:02.020 --> 32:05.489
Why did you have to save them?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.625
Why didn't you just
let him kill them all?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.693
That's what they deserve.

32:09.728 --> 32:10.961
I know, they are
awful people,

32:10.995 --> 32:13.263
they did awful things.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.798
(sobbing)

32:14.832 --> 32:16.466
They killed my boy.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.368
VINCENT: And we're gonna
make them pay, Sam.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.804
Okay, we're gonna
do it together,

32:20.838 --> 32:22.839
but we got to do it
the right way.

32:22.873 --> 32:25.175
You can testify
against them,

32:25.209 --> 32:26.443
you can show
the whole world

32:26.477 --> 32:28.845
exactly what you have uncovered.

32:28.879 --> 32:31.681
It won't matter;
they're above the law.

32:31.715 --> 32:33.382
No, they're
not, Sam.

32:33.417 --> 32:34.484
Nobody is, okay?

32:34.518 --> 32:36.820
Not, not them, not you, not me.

32:36.854 --> 32:38.655
Listen, Sam,

32:38.689 --> 32:41.023
I have been
exactly where you are.

32:41.058 --> 32:42.992
All right, I've tried
to make the pain go away

32:43.026 --> 32:44.627
by making the people
who caused it pay,

32:44.662 --> 32:48.831
you know, doing it my way,
but it doesn't work, Sam.

32:48.865 --> 32:52.068
Okay, it just causes more pain
and more destruction.

32:52.102 --> 32:54.070
Listen to me, man.

32:54.104 --> 32:55.537
Look at what
you're doing.

32:55.572 --> 32:56.973
You're trying
to hurt them,

32:57.007 --> 32:58.374
but you're
hurting yourself.

32:58.408 --> 33:00.109
It's, it's not gonna
bring your boy back.

33:03.012 --> 33:05.080
Okay, but you can make a change,

33:05.114 --> 33:07.048
Sam, you can change
tactics.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.750
All right,
we need you

33:08.785 --> 33:11.419
to help us to put these people
away so they will never hurt

33:11.454 --> 33:13.655
anybody else again, okay?

33:13.690 --> 33:16.558
We need you,
Sam, come on.

33:16.593 --> 33:17.559
That's it.

33:17.594 --> 33:19.727
Come on, come down.

33:21.864 --> 33:24.265
(sighs)

33:26.068 --> 33:27.235
No!

33:28.537 --> 33:31.473
(growling)

33:39.948 --> 33:42.049
Why'd you save me?

33:42.083 --> 33:44.084
You should have let me die.

33:57.159 --> 33:59.227
Hey.
Hey.

33:59.261 --> 34:01.061
You okay?

34:01.096 --> 34:03.431
Yeah. I don't know, it's
a little bittersweet, though.

34:03.465 --> 34:05.600
Yes, we finally stopped Sam,

34:05.634 --> 34:07.768
but, I don't know, it feels a
little hollow, don't you think?

34:07.802 --> 34:09.237
We broke up
their secret society.

34:09.271 --> 34:10.505
Just take
a little bit of digging.

34:10.539 --> 34:12.106
We can put them away
for a long time.

34:12.139 --> 34:14.074
Yeah, I still wished
I could have done more, though.

34:14.109 --> 34:15.775
That's the old you talking.

34:15.810 --> 34:20.014
The one that used to take
the law into his own hands.

34:20.047 --> 34:21.348
I like the new you better.

34:21.382 --> 34:24.351
Oh, you do, do you?

34:27.388 --> 34:31.424
Six years is a long time to hold
onto all that pain and anger.

34:31.458 --> 34:34.027
Can't even imagine.

34:34.061 --> 34:36.263
I can.
All that time before we met,

34:36.297 --> 34:39.032
you know, chasing after
the people that did this to me.

34:39.065 --> 34:41.201
I don't know, it really
consumes you, you know?

34:41.235 --> 34:42.969
It can change a person.

34:43.003 --> 34:46.039
Don't worry, I am never
going back to that life again.

34:46.072 --> 34:48.407
I believe that.

34:51.011 --> 34:52.978
I still think you both
took a hell of a risk.

34:53.013 --> 34:54.647
It worked out, though,
didn't it?

34:54.681 --> 34:56.315
Depends on how
much of a case

34:56.349 --> 34:57.616
I'm able to build
against them.

34:57.651 --> 34:59.218
Fortunately Sam's
willing to help.

34:59.252 --> 35:01.753
You don't think they'll
say anything about...?

35:02.755 --> 35:03.889
I doubt it.

35:03.923 --> 35:05.324
Especially since
they were the ones

35:05.358 --> 35:06.825
behind the beast experiments
in the first place.

35:06.859 --> 35:09.127
Another thing you don't
have to go back to.

35:09.162 --> 35:11.063
Yeah.

35:11.097 --> 35:13.832
Well, uh,
I should probably get going.

35:23.109 --> 35:25.543
(siren wailing)

35:46.565 --> 35:48.966
You don't want me
to come up, do you?

35:51.369 --> 35:54.105
No.

35:54.139 --> 35:55.906
God, you are making a big
mistake, Catherine.

35:55.941 --> 35:57.241
You know that.
Gabe, please don't...

35:57.275 --> 35:58.909
He is a beast and
he always will be.

35:58.944 --> 36:00.377
He is not
gonna change.

36:00.411 --> 36:01.779
He has already changed.

36:01.813 --> 36:03.313
Don't be so naive,
Catherine.

36:07.385 --> 36:09.553
Look...

36:09.587 --> 36:12.256
I can't keep protecting
you against him.

36:12.290 --> 36:15.459
Protect? I don't need you
to protect me from anything.

36:15.493 --> 36:17.127
I'm sorry, that's
not what I meant.

36:17.161 --> 36:18.395
Yes, it is.

36:18.429 --> 36:19.763
Be honest.

36:19.797 --> 36:22.299
Okay, you want
honesty?

36:22.333 --> 36:25.601
You may think that
Vincent has changed,

36:25.636 --> 36:27.637
you may even believe
that he actually has,

36:27.671 --> 36:29.939
but I used to be what
he is, and I know

36:29.974 --> 36:32.374
sooner or later, he is
going to hurt you...

36:32.399 --> 36:33.509
Gabe...

36:33.510 --> 36:35.511
...and you will be sorry!
Gabe, please.

36:38.649 --> 36:40.483
The only thing
I am sorry about

36:40.517 --> 36:42.918
is that things didn't
work out between us,

36:42.952 --> 36:45.321
because I cared about you.

36:45.355 --> 36:46.756
I still do.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.090
Sure.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.959
I do.

36:50.994 --> 36:52.662
And I'm sorry.

36:54.130 --> 36:57.966
I won't let
him hurt you.

40:16.626 --> 40:18.894
Let me guess, more flowers?

40:20.397 --> 40:22.431
Detective McCulley,
95th.

40:22.466 --> 40:24.433
We're looking for
Vincent Keller.

40:24.468 --> 40:25.501
CATHERINE:
What?

40:25.535 --> 40:26.935
Excuse us, Detective.

40:26.970 --> 40:28.170
What are
you doing?

40:28.205 --> 40:29.438
Vincent Keller?
Yeah.

40:29.473 --> 40:30.873
You're under arrest.
Arrest?

40:30.907 --> 40:32.674
For what?
For the murder of Curt Windsor.

40:32.709 --> 40:34.209
Okay, I think there's
been a mistake.

40:34.243 --> 40:35.811
McCULLEY: No mistake,
ma'am, here's the warrant.

40:35.845 --> 40:37.612
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say

40:37.646 --> 40:39.780
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

40:39.815 --> 40:40.948
Why is this happening?

40:40.983 --> 40:41.983
I don't know.

40:42.017 --> 40:43.885
Vincent...

40:43.919 --> 40:45.152
Don't worry, I'll be fine, okay?
