WEBVTT

00:00.659 --> 00:02.087
Two regulars please.

00:02.137 --> 00:03.770
Okay, so our son has been invited

00:03.772 --> 00:05.639
to three birthday parties this weekend.

00:05.641 --> 00:07.541
You know, he can barely walk, and he has

00:07.543 --> 00:09.142
a busier social life than we do.

00:09.144 --> 00:10.877
Please tell me at least
one of them is a drop-off.

00:10.879 --> 00:11.945
Mnh-mnh.

00:11.947 --> 00:14.047
Hey. "In lieu of presents,
please make a donation"

00:14.049 --> 00:15.848
"to save the giant sequoia tree fund."

00:15.850 --> 00:19.118
I do so hope to see Athena, my cat.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.254
She died nine years ago.

00:21.256 --> 00:22.821
I just think that a kid would prefer

00:22.823 --> 00:24.390
to have a toy over saving a giant tree.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.425
That's all I'm saying.

00:25.427 --> 00:28.661
Do cats go to the same place as people?

00:28.663 --> 00:30.263
I'm not sure.

00:30.265 --> 00:32.631
Charlie, is everything okay?

00:32.633 --> 00:35.201
Yeah, yeah, just, uh...

00:35.203 --> 00:37.569
We're not alone.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.238
Right, well, could you
turn it off for a minute,

00:40.240 --> 00:42.074
just tell them that your
girlfriend's talking to you?

00:42.076 --> 00:45.343
Oh, trust me, if I could turn
it off for good, I would.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.246
Oh, look, and now duty calls.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.881
I love you.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.151
[sighs]

00:53.153 --> 00:55.287
Oh, would <i>you</i> like a coffee?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.521
Yes, thank you.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.723
- Mm.
- So, how is resident life treating you?

00:59.725 --> 01:03.060
Oh, I don't know if I'd call
it a life, but it's great.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.428
You know, I remember, I was so tired once

01:04.430 --> 01:05.862
that I forgot my name in front of a patient.

01:05.864 --> 01:07.298
[elevator bell dings] [laughs]

01:07.300 --> 01:10.234
Last week, I wore my
scrubs backwards... twice.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.604
Ladies, the acceptable amount
of caffeine for surgeons

01:13.606 --> 01:14.805
is 200 milligrams a day.

01:14.807 --> 01:15.872
Says who?

01:15.874 --> 01:18.041
Says a recent study out of Johns Hopkins.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.376
And, since Dawn is on leave,

01:19.378 --> 01:21.245
your new interim chief of surgery.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.414
Are you talking about
yourself in the third person?

01:24.416 --> 01:26.382
There'll be no finger
tremors during anastomosis.

01:26.384 --> 01:29.052
Not under Hamza's watch.

01:29.054 --> 01:31.922
Hey, I'm gonna lodge a formal complaint.

01:31.924 --> 01:33.924
Hon, take it up with the chief.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.492
[elevator bell dings]

01:35.494 --> 01:37.393
[sighs]

01:37.395 --> 01:39.496
[siren wails]

01:39.498 --> 01:40.631
Zach, what do we got?

01:40.633 --> 01:42.699
We got a 44-year-old male, Cal Nedman,

01:42.701 --> 01:45.568
possible posterior
sternoclavicular dislocation.

01:45.570 --> 01:47.837
Took a hit
from a 300-pound lineman.

01:47.839 --> 01:48.938
Whoa, no padding?

01:48.940 --> 01:50.473
Looks like he was hit by a truck.

01:50.475 --> 01:51.608
- Yeah.
- Is he the coach?

01:51.610 --> 01:52.975
Yeah. And my dad.

01:52.977 --> 01:54.277
Okay, son, you're gonna have to

01:54.279 --> 01:56.346
wait out in the, uh,
in the waiting area, okay?

01:56.348 --> 01:57.514
I can't get an airway.

01:57.516 --> 01:59.249
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He's in good hands.

01:59.251 --> 02:00.783
Could you show him where to wait, please?

02:00.785 --> 02:01.651
Nurse: Yeah, follow me.

02:04.687 --> 02:05.687
He's choking out, guys.

02:05.689 --> 02:07.088
Clavicle's pressing on the windpipe.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.490
Uh... towel clip.

02:08.491 --> 02:10.526
You gonna shoehorn him?
That's usually done in the O.R.

02:10.527 --> 02:11.760
Yeah, no time.

02:11.762 --> 02:13.629
Uh, let's have cardiac
on the standby, please.

02:16.566 --> 02:17.699
Okay. Ready?

02:17.701 --> 02:19.868
- Do it.
- One, two, three.

02:21.504 --> 02:23.172
No, he's still in trouble.

02:23.174 --> 02:24.172
Tracheal deviation?

02:24.174 --> 02:25.139
Chest tube.

02:25.141 --> 02:26.174
Give me a 16-gauge.

02:32.514 --> 02:33.781
There we go.

02:33.783 --> 02:35.516
Okay.

02:35.518 --> 02:37.918
Tube's in.

02:38.887 --> 02:40.621
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- That's a lot of blood.

02:40.623 --> 02:41.689
Okay.

02:41.691 --> 02:42.856
The bone's lacerated something.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.458
- Innominate vein?
- Okay, clamp that tube.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.359
We need to get him to the
O.R. before he bleeds out.

02:46.361 --> 02:47.494
Let's go, guys. Let's hurry.

02:47.496 --> 02:49.596
Sorry.

02:49.598 --> 02:52.031
Let's go.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:01.800 --> 03:05.527
[monitors beeping]

03:05.940 --> 03:08.190
Well, that was a hell of a mess.

03:08.409 --> 03:10.675
Okay, both ends
of the vein are clamped.

03:10.956 --> 03:13.145
Just a couple of more stitches in the graft.

03:13.147 --> 03:15.562
Yeah, this guy has
officially dodged a bullet.

03:15.682 --> 03:17.934
Watch the clavicle.
The edge is still jagged.

03:17.984 --> 03:19.233
Yep.

03:19.304 --> 03:20.496
Suction.

03:20.546 --> 03:22.081
Oxygen S.A.T.s at 80.

03:22.131 --> 03:24.299
B.P.... 71 over 45.

03:24.376 --> 03:26.181
I'm reading that Shahir has you as lead

03:26.231 --> 03:27.924
on 13 surgeries this week.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.295
The milk in my fridge is going to walk away

03:30.297 --> 03:31.430
before I get home.

03:31.432 --> 03:33.420
Feels good to be quarterback, though, right?

03:33.512 --> 03:35.600
Sure. You ever play football?

03:35.602 --> 03:37.458
Yep, in college. [sighs]

03:37.508 --> 03:39.146
I could never figure out
the difference between

03:39.196 --> 03:41.533
a fullback and a halfback.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.816
About 50 pounds.

03:42.866 --> 03:43.547
Huh.

03:43.701 --> 03:47.203
Okay, clamp coming off.

03:47.259 --> 03:49.309
Aw, damn it!

03:49.646 --> 03:50.827
Dr. Lin.

03:50.877 --> 03:52.983
I'm okay.
At least I'm in the O.R.

03:52.985 --> 03:56.053
4-0 and needle driver.

03:56.055 --> 03:57.154
Jackson.

03:57.156 --> 03:59.140
Elizabeth Grant here for
her final appointment.

03:59.190 --> 04:00.050
Exam room 3.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.614
Oh, and had a cake sent in, I take it.

04:01.664 --> 04:03.562
Yeah, caramel ripple...
the way to a nurse's heart.

04:03.612 --> 04:04.902
Mmm.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.297
Hey, how's everything
going with the radiation?

04:08.299 --> 04:09.198
Splendid.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.132
That's it?

04:10.134 --> 04:10.898
That's it.

04:10.948 --> 04:12.263
So, they zapped all the spots?

04:12.313 --> 04:14.538
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Just waiting on the C.T. results.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.972
Have you told anyone else yet?

04:15.974 --> 04:18.173
No, I have not, because I
don't want to worry anyone

04:18.176 --> 04:19.375
until I get the call.

04:19.378 --> 04:21.209
So, with any luck,
this little hiccup just stays

04:21.212 --> 04:22.178
between the two of us.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.179
Mm-hmm. You sound hopeful.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.481
I am.

04:24.483 --> 04:26.463
I am really hopeful that
things can get back to normal

04:26.513 --> 04:28.287
and you can stop being so nice to me.

04:28.337 --> 04:30.085
Oh, please. I'm nice to everyone.

04:30.087 --> 04:32.288
Doesn't Dr. Hamza have a rule
about that much caffeine?

04:32.338 --> 04:36.792
He does, but I was
chief once, too, you know.

04:38.332 --> 04:39.587
Great.

04:39.664 --> 04:40.862
So, Dixie, why don't you tell us

04:40.864 --> 04:42.364
more about what's
brought you in here today?

04:42.366 --> 04:44.800
It's like the perma-flu.

04:44.802 --> 04:47.502
It's constant nausea, this nagging headache.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.136
Well, the C.T. you had in emergency

04:49.138 --> 04:51.138
shows nothing unusual
going on in your belly.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.374
Great, so, some grade-a painkillers

04:53.376 --> 04:55.410
should take care of it,
if you could just write that up.

04:55.412 --> 04:56.344
What's the rush?

04:56.346 --> 04:57.945
Oh, it's my gido.

04:57.947 --> 05:00.080
He's been living with
me since my baba passed,

05:00.082 --> 05:01.993
and it's almost time for
his lunch pills, so...

05:02.073 --> 05:04.552
Whoa! Okay, take it easy.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.920
[exhales sharply]

05:05.922 --> 05:07.488
Have you been getting enough rest?

05:07.490 --> 05:10.224
Um, probably not.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.292
Between taking gido to his appointments

05:12.294 --> 05:14.728
and making sure he's eating,
putting him to bed,

05:14.730 --> 05:15.629
that kind of thing.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.597
- That's a full plate.
- Yeah.

05:17.599 --> 05:20.400
I could write a prescription,
something to help you sleep.

05:20.402 --> 05:22.569
Oh, you are a goddess.

05:22.571 --> 05:24.270
[slurring] Thank you guys...

05:24.272 --> 05:25.672
[mumbling]

05:25.674 --> 05:27.974
Listen, Dixie, I know that
you're in a hurry to get home,

05:27.976 --> 05:29.676
but I really do need you to stick around

05:29.678 --> 05:30.677
for a couple more tests.

05:30.679 --> 05:32.379
Well, what about gido?

05:32.381 --> 05:34.913
I could send a mobile nurse
to give him his pills.

05:34.915 --> 05:36.248
[sighs] Think of it this way,

05:36.250 --> 05:38.584
it's a chance for you to lay down.

05:43.590 --> 05:44.557
Hey.

05:44.559 --> 05:46.058
Ah, we're just trading recipes.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.060
Yeah, I swapped my famous summer berry tarts

05:48.062 --> 05:49.194
for his lemon cheesecake.

05:49.196 --> 05:50.830
I didn't know you baked.

05:50.832 --> 05:51.897
It relaxes me.

05:51.899 --> 05:53.098
Guy's got to eat.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.200
We're gonna miss having you around here.

05:55.202 --> 05:57.903
But nice to finally be going home, I bet.

05:57.905 --> 05:58.803
Yeah, it is.

05:58.805 --> 06:00.839
Okay, let's take a look.

06:02.408 --> 06:05.677
Yeah, those skin grafts are healing nicely.

06:05.679 --> 06:06.745
Do you have enough cream?

06:06.747 --> 06:08.012
Only about two years' worth.

06:08.014 --> 06:09.481
Let's see those arms.

06:09.483 --> 06:11.949
Good.

06:11.951 --> 06:14.886
Can you touch your thumb
to your pinky finger?

06:14.888 --> 06:15.820
Any pain?

06:15.822 --> 06:16.888
No pain.

06:16.890 --> 06:20.258
Okay, press against my hand for me.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.993
There you go, nicely done.

06:21.995 --> 06:23.961
Not a lot of contracture, skin is moist.

06:23.963 --> 06:26.330
You've obviously been
keeping up with your physio.

06:26.332 --> 06:27.615
All Dr. Kinney has to do

06:27.667 --> 06:29.166
is fit you for some compression garments.

06:29.216 --> 06:32.132
And then you are officially
cleared to go home.

06:32.254 --> 06:34.901
That's great.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.279
Yeah, that's great.

06:47.987 --> 06:49.586
How's he doing?

06:49.588 --> 06:51.126
Still no change.

06:51.223 --> 06:53.723
He's in recovery, but you
should be able to see him soon.

06:53.725 --> 06:54.990
Is he going to be okay?

06:54.992 --> 06:58.060
He took a pretty hard hit,
but he pulled through.

06:58.062 --> 06:59.729
You know what's weird?

06:59.731 --> 07:01.601
This won't turn my dad off football.

07:01.651 --> 07:02.765
He'll still be obsessed with it

07:02.767 --> 07:04.875
even though it almost killed him.

07:05.169 --> 07:07.362
He played in college, but his knee gave out.

07:07.437 --> 07:10.426
That's a pretty tough pill to swallow.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.708
He's a really good coach, though.

07:12.710 --> 07:14.811
Sent five kids off to the pros already.

07:15.108 --> 07:17.012
I'll probably make the college team, too.

07:17.575 --> 07:19.484
That's great.

07:19.869 --> 07:23.653
I'm trying my best
to re-live his glory, you know?

07:24.151 --> 07:26.322
Yeah, well, I'll, uh...

07:26.324 --> 07:28.223
I'll let you know when he's up for a visit.

07:28.225 --> 07:29.124
Thanks.

07:33.524 --> 07:36.245
Which could be a while.
You want me to

07:36.295 --> 07:38.107
find you something
a little less padded to wear?

07:38.202 --> 07:39.634
That'd be nice.

07:39.636 --> 07:41.437
You bet.

07:44.123 --> 07:45.674
[sighs]

07:59.555 --> 08:01.456
Hello.

08:04.393 --> 08:05.794
Can I help you with something?

08:05.796 --> 08:08.363
Questions, directions, that sort of thing?

08:09.732 --> 08:12.166
I'm so pretty.

08:16.805 --> 08:18.172
Okay.

08:23.745 --> 08:26.914
It's a huge malignant glioma,
probably a glioblastoma.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.117
Explains the headaches, the nausea.

08:29.119 --> 08:30.485
And the slurred words.

08:30.487 --> 08:32.186
Can we operate?

08:32.188 --> 08:33.020
No.

08:33.023 --> 08:34.121
See here?

08:34.124 --> 08:36.190
The tumor's invading the cerebral peduncle.

08:36.192 --> 08:38.626
You can't resect it without
leaving her with a deficit.

08:38.628 --> 08:40.227
What about bevac?

08:40.230 --> 08:41.861
Maybe.

08:41.864 --> 08:44.264
Either way, she's only got
a couple months to live.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.768
These tumors are a death sentence.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.770
Okay, I guess we have to tell her.

08:49.772 --> 08:52.339
Let me do it.

08:52.341 --> 08:54.408
It's the worst part of the job, hands down.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.577
I know. I-I don't want
to shy away from that.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.811
Are you sure?

08:57.813 --> 08:59.413
I'm sure.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.949
All right.

09:04.485 --> 09:07.320
I have brain cancer?

09:10.558 --> 09:13.060
How?

09:13.062 --> 09:15.162
These type of tumors grow quickly.

09:15.164 --> 09:18.498
By the time they're discovered,
they can be quite advanced.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.800
Um...

09:20.802 --> 09:24.904
Gido needs a, uh, a driver
and a nurse for his pills.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.273
I mean, those retirement places,

09:26.275 --> 09:28.960
they have waiting lists of, like, two years.

09:30.378 --> 09:32.179
[sighs]

09:33.481 --> 09:34.714
How long do I have?

09:36.517 --> 09:38.785
Tell me everything.

09:41.121 --> 09:44.791
You could start losing cognitive
function within weeks.

09:44.793 --> 09:48.695
You likely have no more than six months.

09:52.532 --> 09:54.100
Doctor, is that true?

09:56.369 --> 10:01.107
Every tumor is different,
and this is very serious, yes.

10:01.109 --> 10:04.043
Then, um, I have to go. [sniffles]

10:04.045 --> 10:06.012
Um, I have so much to do.

10:06.014 --> 10:07.179
I have to...

10:07.181 --> 10:08.047
[sobs]

10:08.049 --> 10:11.084
Dixie.

10:11.086 --> 10:13.585
Just wait.

10:13.587 --> 10:16.622
There could be an option.

10:16.624 --> 10:17.789
What do you mean?

10:17.791 --> 10:19.891
[sniffs] What kind of option?

10:19.893 --> 10:21.493
Have you heard of viral therapy?

10:21.495 --> 10:22.327
No.

10:22.329 --> 10:23.361
Dr. Reid?

10:24.530 --> 10:26.098
It's very new.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.267
And it's still
in the experimental stage.

10:29.269 --> 10:30.368
Okay, but, what?

10:30.370 --> 10:32.971
So you're saying that I
could... I could live.

10:32.973 --> 10:34.539
I'm saying that it's a long shot,

10:34.541 --> 10:37.843
but it's a possibility.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.277
So, please, just stay,

10:39.279 --> 10:40.846
and we will discuss a treatment plan.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.413
All right.

10:42.415 --> 10:45.350
But gido needs to be here, okay?

10:45.352 --> 10:47.084
Because he really needs me.

10:47.086 --> 10:49.320
Alex: All right.

10:49.322 --> 10:50.622
Okay.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.259
You were a little blunt in there.

10:54.261 --> 10:56.827
I thought she should make
decisions based on facts.

10:56.829 --> 10:59.030
Well, now she's making them based on fear.

10:59.032 --> 11:00.532
She said she wanted to know everything.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.333
People say they want to
know everything, Cassie,

11:02.335 --> 11:04.369
but that doesn't mean they're
actually ready to hear it.

11:04.371 --> 11:05.836
I don't understand.

11:05.838 --> 11:08.806
With news like this, it's all about timing.

11:08.808 --> 11:10.941
Okay, but you straight-up lied to her.

11:10.943 --> 11:12.643
You said there was an option.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.444
Viral therapy is an option.

11:14.446 --> 11:15.746
It's experimental.

11:15.748 --> 11:16.947
True.

11:16.949 --> 11:18.749
And Hope Zion's not even approved.

11:18.751 --> 11:21.652
Also true, but luckily,
I have an in with the interim chief.

11:21.654 --> 11:23.287
Shahir is my guy.

11:23.289 --> 11:24.555
Your guy?

11:24.557 --> 11:25.723
Yeah, I know him.

11:25.725 --> 11:27.591
He will not pass on an
opportunity like this,

11:27.593 --> 11:28.525
trust me.

11:32.897 --> 11:34.764
The smoking cessation
subcommittee wants $2,000

11:34.766 --> 11:36.099
for new posters,

11:36.101 --> 11:38.501
and the surgical recovery
ward is threatening to protest

11:38.503 --> 11:41.270
if the vending machines don't go vegan.

11:41.272 --> 11:42.906
Well...

11:42.908 --> 11:45.075
I will see you in a minute.

11:45.077 --> 11:46.475
I can come back.

11:46.477 --> 11:48.712
No, I love this. Come in.

11:48.714 --> 11:51.514
How much have you heard about this?

11:51.516 --> 11:54.184
Phase one study,
Dr. Friedman, Duke University.

11:54.186 --> 11:55.718
On glioblastomas and polio.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.885
Mm-hmm.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.221
The tumor is injected
with re-engineered polio,

11:59.223 --> 12:01.223
and the immune system fights the virus.

12:01.225 --> 12:02.925
And the cancer at the same time.

12:02.927 --> 12:05.894
It's in its early days, but intriguing work.

12:05.896 --> 12:07.429
I knew you'd be as excited as I am,

12:07.431 --> 12:09.464
and if anybody can fast
track this for my patient,

12:09.466 --> 12:10.733
the board loves you.

12:10.735 --> 12:12.835
Alex, absolutely not.

12:12.837 --> 12:14.002
Shahir, we can do this.

12:14.004 --> 12:15.637
You're asking me to throw my weight around

12:15.639 --> 12:17.706
for a study that is in its infancy.

12:17.708 --> 12:18.741
And we don't even know

12:18.743 --> 12:20.074
the effectiveness of it long term.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.943
It's been successful in 11 patients.

12:21.945 --> 12:23.510
And unsuccessful in just as many.

12:23.512 --> 12:25.446
And those patients died horrible deaths...

12:25.448 --> 12:26.714
paralysis, blindness.

12:26.716 --> 12:27.915
Duke is adjusting the dosages.

12:27.917 --> 12:28.750
Alex.

12:28.752 --> 12:29.817
If Dawn was still chief,

12:29.819 --> 12:31.152
you wouldn't have gone to her with this.

12:31.154 --> 12:32.920
Well, then, lucky for me, Dawn isn't.

12:32.922 --> 12:34.756
You're asking me to risk my reputation.

12:34.758 --> 12:37.524
No, I'm asking you to help
me save a 28-year-old woman

12:37.526 --> 12:39.260
who has
inoperable brain cancer.

12:39.262 --> 12:40.962
I can't think of just one patient.

12:40.964 --> 12:44.131
I have the whole hospital to consider.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.499
The answer is no.

12:57.219 --> 12:58.186
Oh, sorry.

12:58.188 --> 13:00.588
No, no, it's okay. It's sports.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.623
I wanted the art section, anyway.

13:02.625 --> 13:06.461
Athena was a korat, an ancient cat of Siam.

13:06.463 --> 13:08.496
Not now.

13:08.498 --> 13:10.565
Did you want to be alone?

13:10.567 --> 13:11.866
Uh... what?

13:11.868 --> 13:13.968
I mean, I could eat while
staring off into space,

13:13.970 --> 13:16.504
but I'd way rather talk to someone.

13:16.506 --> 13:17.638
I'm Kristine.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.906
Charlie.

13:18.908 --> 13:21.308
[chuckles] Surprised
we've never crossed paths.

13:21.310 --> 13:23.136
I-I work up on the eighth floor.

13:23.246 --> 13:24.245
Palliative care.

13:24.247 --> 13:25.545
Yeah.

13:25.547 --> 13:27.709
End of life is kind of my thing.

13:27.759 --> 13:29.416
That's a tough job.

13:29.418 --> 13:31.551
Yeah, but somebody's got to do it, right?

13:31.553 --> 13:33.520
Do you think they have chicken livers

13:33.522 --> 13:35.989
on-on the other side, I mean?

13:35.991 --> 13:37.394
You know what?

13:37.444 --> 13:38.685
Uh, I would love to stay and chat,

13:38.735 --> 13:40.894
but I just remembered, I have a surgery, so

13:40.896 --> 13:42.829
got to eat and read on the run, you know?

13:42.831 --> 13:43.730
[chuckles]

13:43.732 --> 13:45.231
Well, it was nice to meet you.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.600
Yeah, you too.

13:46.602 --> 13:50.106
C-could you just tell me
if I'll see Athena again?

13:52.111 --> 13:54.140
I'll, uh, I'll see you later.

13:54.142 --> 13:57.354
Yeah, shouldn't keep an old
cat lady waiting, right?

14:07.154 --> 14:08.987
Okay, Louise, here's the thing.

14:08.989 --> 14:10.522
Maybe the cats go to the same place,

14:10.524 --> 14:12.490
maybe they don't,
but you won't find out for sure

14:12.492 --> 14:13.859
until you get there.

14:13.861 --> 14:17.362
Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?

14:20.499 --> 14:22.701
[sighs]

14:26.039 --> 14:28.340
Wrist circumference, 4.2 inches.

14:28.342 --> 14:30.775
Radial forearm length, 11.4.

14:30.777 --> 14:32.677
Do I have to wear these all the time?

14:32.679 --> 14:34.346
23 hours a day.

14:34.348 --> 14:35.447
Yikes.

14:35.449 --> 14:37.449
You can get them in different colors.

14:37.451 --> 14:39.150
You know, coordinate your work ensemble.

14:39.152 --> 14:40.985
Yeah, I'm not too worried about that.

14:40.987 --> 14:42.654
Well, I guess social worker beige

14:42.656 --> 14:43.822
does go with everything.

14:43.824 --> 14:45.522
No, it's not that.
I'm not going back to work.

14:45.572 --> 14:47.392
I've already notified my agency.

14:47.394 --> 14:48.593
What?

14:48.595 --> 14:50.161
Why? You love your job.

14:50.163 --> 14:51.496
I <i>did.</i>

14:52.565 --> 14:55.132
Those kids are the only
thing you have talked about

14:55.134 --> 14:56.401
since you have been here.

14:56.403 --> 14:58.635
It's just different now.
[cellphone vibrates]

15:00.638 --> 15:02.706
Okay, um...

15:02.708 --> 15:03.957
Sorry, I have to take this,

15:04.015 --> 15:06.109
but you and me, we're not done here.

15:14.886 --> 15:16.353
Hey.

15:16.355 --> 15:18.322
What is it?

15:18.891 --> 15:21.091
Oh, your test results.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.257
Please.

15:23.414 --> 15:25.678
Don't touch me.

15:26.573 --> 15:28.235
What's going on? Are you all right?

15:28.285 --> 15:29.131
Yeah.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.966
Take this to the resource
center for me, please.

15:30.968 --> 15:32.568
Hey, uh, do you... do you have a second?

15:32.570 --> 15:34.069
I need to talk to you about something.

15:34.071 --> 15:35.170
- Yeah, me, too.
- Ah.

15:35.172 --> 15:36.472
You know, you think you know somebody.

15:36.474 --> 15:38.003
More trouble on mars?

15:38.053 --> 15:39.318
No, it's Shahir.

15:39.368 --> 15:40.843
We have a chance to do something
really great for a patient,

15:40.845 --> 15:43.379
but he won't do it because he's
too concerned about the hospital.

15:43.381 --> 15:44.613
Well, that's his job now.

15:44.615 --> 15:46.715
See the big picture,
protect the hospital's interests.

15:46.717 --> 15:47.950
Ahead of the patient?

15:47.952 --> 15:49.118
No, in addition to.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.960
Well, it's not the Shahir I know.

15:51.010 --> 15:51.996
Well, I don't know.

15:52.046 --> 15:54.123
Maybe you can show him how
he can help the patient

15:54.125 --> 15:55.657
and the hospital at the same time.

15:55.659 --> 15:58.928
I-I mean, the Shahir you know
is still in there, I promise.

15:58.930 --> 16:00.595
He's probably just drowning in paperwork.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.030
You're right. You're always right.

16:02.032 --> 16:03.164
- Well...
- I'm sorry.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.533
You said you wanted to talk about something.

16:04.535 --> 16:07.135
Oh, um, no. It can wait.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.370
Great, catch you later.

16:12.675 --> 16:15.076
Dr. Friedman has worked
out a dosage for the polio

16:15.078 --> 16:16.991
that will minimize complications.

16:17.563 --> 16:18.878
Why are we still talking about this?

16:18.928 --> 16:20.678
Because I'm trying to do
what's right for my patient.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.365
And I need to do what's
best for the hospital.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.136
Well, this could be great
for the hospital, Shahir.

16:24.186 --> 16:24.752
Think about it,

16:24.754 --> 16:27.707
"Hope Zion spearheads an
innovative new treatment."

16:30.843 --> 16:33.605
You know, Charlie told me once

16:33.655 --> 16:34.795
that your grandmother used to

16:34.797 --> 16:37.365
put your grandfather's slippers
in the oven to warm them up.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.399
Is that true?

16:38.401 --> 16:40.168
Yes, she almost burnt the house down.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.769
It's not a recommended practice.

16:42.058 --> 16:43.771
And she used to
wash his hair in the sink

16:43.773 --> 16:45.940
when he couldn't wash
it for himself anymore.

16:45.942 --> 16:48.809
Until the day he died, mm-hmm.

16:49.028 --> 16:51.292
Now she has Alzheimer's.

16:51.982 --> 16:54.315
What if she'd gotten sick first?

16:55.244 --> 16:57.417
I know what you're trying to do, Alex.

16:57.827 --> 16:59.588
Then come with me.

17:00.956 --> 17:04.657
Okay. So, here's some water.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.026
Wash it down.

17:06.028 --> 17:07.728
Thank you, Kohana.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.829
Hello. There's someone I'd
like both of you to meet.

17:09.832 --> 17:12.232
Dr. Hamza, this is Dixie and gido.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.433
Nice to meet you.

17:14.435 --> 17:15.801
Have you eaten anything?

17:15.804 --> 17:16.869
I'm not so hungry.

17:16.872 --> 17:19.638
Gido, you need to eat.

17:19.641 --> 17:22.108
You're cold.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.910
You'd think they could afford

17:23.912 --> 17:26.078
to keep the heat up in these places.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.118
Can she have this, or is there some rule?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.353
No rule against Mountain Dew, no.

17:34.355 --> 17:35.555
Thank you.

17:35.557 --> 17:38.524
I thought of a few things.

17:38.526 --> 17:41.460
Like, uh...

17:41.462 --> 17:42.828
skunking you.

17:42.830 --> 17:44.930
[laughs]

17:44.932 --> 17:47.699
That sounds like a plan.

17:47.701 --> 17:50.236
So, Shahir, what do you think?

17:50.238 --> 17:52.738
I think it's manipulative.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.507
But look at them. He needs her.

17:54.509 --> 17:56.442
If it wasn't a desperate situation,

17:56.444 --> 17:58.710
I wouldn't consider the treatment, either.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.803
Okay.

18:04.566 --> 18:07.786
Dixie, we do need to talk.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.220
About your news?

18:10.807 --> 18:12.774
It's not good news, gido.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.530
But there may be an option.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.656
I'll speak to the board.

18:23.804 --> 18:26.337
Thank you.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.405
[sighs]

18:27.407 --> 18:29.807
[monitor beeping]

18:31.610 --> 18:33.711
I thought you said he was gonna be okay.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.812
Look at him.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.147
Yeah, I know he looks a little rough,

18:36.149 --> 18:41.152
but, uh, he's gonna come back,
kind of like a pick-6,

18:41.154 --> 18:42.920
no time left on the clock,
you know what I mean?

18:42.922 --> 18:45.823
Can we not talk about football?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.759
Uh, yeah, just trying to
take your mind off things.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.761
Honestly...

18:51.763 --> 18:53.663
I hate it.

18:53.665 --> 18:56.533
Listen, Ty, I know you feel
that way right now, but...

18:56.535 --> 18:59.035
I never liked it.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.737
Then why play?

19:00.739 --> 19:02.739
My dad loves it.

19:04.175 --> 19:06.577
I played for him.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.483
[sighs]

19:12.485 --> 19:15.319
Why didn't you ever say anything?

19:15.321 --> 19:19.219
Uh... he can't see you or hear you.

19:19.624 --> 19:21.124
But you can.

19:21.126 --> 19:22.592
Yep.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.427
It's kind of my thing.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.262
If he didn't want to play football,

19:26.264 --> 19:28.131
he should have just said something.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.334
Wait a second.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.503
You know that guy?

19:35.606 --> 19:39.509
I <i>am</i> that guy.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.345
Ty has no idea,
and it has to stay that way.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.412
You understand.

19:43.414 --> 19:45.213
[groans]

19:45.215 --> 19:46.548
Not completely.

19:46.550 --> 19:49.184
He's not ready.

19:49.186 --> 19:52.154
From everything I've seen,
he's pretty tough, Cal.

19:52.156 --> 19:53.821
Please, call me Caroline.

19:53.823 --> 19:54.956
Okay, Caroline.

19:54.958 --> 19:58.160
He pretends to be tough,
but he is a gentle soul.

19:58.162 --> 20:00.128
He is not mature enough to handle everything

20:00.130 --> 20:02.130
that goes along with this yet.

20:02.132 --> 20:04.331
[sighs] So, you lie to him?

20:04.333 --> 20:06.400
Sometimes you have to hide the truth.

20:06.402 --> 20:08.969
Otherwise, you end up hurting
the people you love the most.

20:14.342 --> 20:16.610
Okay. I'll-I'll talk to you later, then.

20:16.612 --> 20:18.712
Okay, thanks, bye.

20:18.714 --> 20:20.113
Sorry about that.

20:20.115 --> 20:21.048
[laughs]

20:21.050 --> 20:22.516
Old school, I love it.

20:22.518 --> 20:23.551
Uh... sorry, what?

20:23.553 --> 20:24.652
The phone thing,

20:24.654 --> 20:26.919
works great until someone actually calls.

20:26.921 --> 20:30.523
I've had to squirm my way
out of that one a few times.

20:30.525 --> 20:32.825
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:32.827 --> 20:33.693
Really?

20:33.695 --> 20:35.695
Really.

20:35.697 --> 20:38.231
Well, I thought when I saw you
earlier at the coffee place,

20:38.233 --> 20:39.232
you were talking to...

20:39.234 --> 20:40.533
myself.

20:40.535 --> 20:42.368
I was... I was talking to myself.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.636
No, I-I do that.

20:43.638 --> 20:46.306
I'm, you know,
just an eccentric surgeon.

20:46.308 --> 20:47.540
[laughs]

20:47.542 --> 20:49.141
Oh, I-I guess I was wrong.

20:49.143 --> 20:50.209
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

20:50.211 --> 20:51.577
I'll see you around.

20:51.579 --> 20:53.978
Sure.

21:00.123 --> 21:01.967
The polio attacks the cancer.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.068
Sounds like
you're replacing one disease

21:04.070 --> 21:05.570
with another disease.

21:05.572 --> 21:07.105
I know that it's really difficult

21:07.107 --> 21:08.172
to wrap your head around.

21:08.174 --> 21:10.341
You're young.

21:10.343 --> 21:13.344
You have no memory of this,

21:13.346 --> 21:16.515
but my best friend
got polio when we were kids.

21:16.517 --> 21:19.150
His whole body stopped working.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.253
He choked to death.

21:22.255 --> 21:24.723
Awful.

21:24.725 --> 21:27.859
I can't let my granddaughter
go through that.

21:27.861 --> 21:29.660
There are risks.

21:29.662 --> 21:31.343
We'll do what we can to shield Dixie

21:31.393 --> 21:32.696
from any complications.

21:32.698 --> 21:33.965
The hell you will.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.967
Gido.

21:35.969 --> 21:37.635
I know this sounds crazy.

21:37.637 --> 21:38.903
It <i>is</i> crazy.

21:40.406 --> 21:44.175
The truth is, regardless of the risks,

21:44.177 --> 21:46.644
this is our only chance.

21:46.646 --> 21:49.613
Gido, I'm...

21:49.615 --> 21:53.717
I'm dying.

21:59.357 --> 22:03.561
I can't live without my Kohana.

22:05.330 --> 22:07.665
[sobs]

22:09.734 --> 22:12.803
Do what you need to do.

22:13.872 --> 22:16.540
The path will help guide
the polio to the tumor?

22:16.542 --> 22:17.908
Yes, and it needs to be exact.

22:17.910 --> 22:21.479
The catheter needs to land right
in the center of the mass.

22:21.481 --> 22:22.680
Like a sniper's bullet.

22:22.682 --> 22:25.949
Precisely, and if we
miss by one millimeter...

22:25.951 --> 22:27.784
Then she will be paralyzed.

22:27.786 --> 22:30.954
That's the best possible outcome.

22:30.956 --> 22:32.722
Well, then, let's not let that happen.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.123
Mm.

22:35.593 --> 22:38.962
Dixie's lucky to have you.

22:38.964 --> 22:40.597
And so am I.

22:40.599 --> 22:42.565
Please, I need to concentrate.

22:42.567 --> 22:44.734
Right.

22:44.736 --> 22:46.669
[monitor beeping]

22:46.671 --> 22:48.837
[monitor beeps rapidly]

22:48.839 --> 22:49.938
Maggie: White blood cell count is good.

22:49.940 --> 22:52.173
Something's wrong!

22:56.212 --> 22:58.179
Okay, B.P. is 70 over 40.

22:58.181 --> 22:59.447
What's happening, Maggie?

22:59.449 --> 23:02.050
He could be suffering a major
M.I. or thrown an embolus.

23:02.052 --> 23:04.352
Ty, did your dad take any
medication of any kind?

23:04.354 --> 23:05.521
Daily aspirin, anything?

23:05.523 --> 23:06.454
I don't know.

23:06.456 --> 23:07.656
Check his bag for me, please.

23:07.658 --> 23:09.943
No! No, he can't... he can't look in there.

23:09.993 --> 23:11.893
I-I started taking hormones.

23:11.895 --> 23:12.994
They're in my bag.

23:15.363 --> 23:17.665
Dr. Harris, I-I found some pills.

23:17.667 --> 23:18.833
Please!

23:18.835 --> 23:20.968
He cannot find out this way.

23:24.406 --> 23:26.040
Get him up for a C.T. angiogram.

23:26.042 --> 23:27.608
Page interventional radiology.

23:27.610 --> 23:30.344
If it is a P.E., I'm gonna need
help with that thrombolysis.

23:30.346 --> 23:31.745
And run a full blood panel.

23:31.747 --> 23:33.246
On it.

23:37.585 --> 23:39.853
Were those pills steroids?

23:42.623 --> 23:45.058
We're not sure.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.694
My dad drilled into us about playing clean.

23:47.696 --> 23:50.329
Said a real man builds up his own strength.

23:50.331 --> 23:51.697
Look, um, why don't you go get some rest?

23:51.699 --> 23:53.332
These test results
are gonna take some time, okay?

23:53.334 --> 23:55.234
Okay.

23:57.571 --> 23:59.972
[clears throat]

24:06.913 --> 24:08.481
You should have told me about this.

24:08.483 --> 24:10.782
It's only been a few weeks.
I didn't think it mattered.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.717
H.R.T. increases risk of clotting, okay?

24:12.719 --> 24:15.220
Patients need to be weaned
off of this before surgery.

24:15.222 --> 24:17.189
This could have cost you your life.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.460
Thank you for not telling him.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.997
All Ty knows for sure is
that you're very sick.

24:25.999 --> 24:29.367
Let's keep it that way.
He'll be none the wiser.

24:29.369 --> 24:32.637
He's gonna find out, Caroline,
one way or the other.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.706
He may be ready.

24:34.708 --> 24:37.609
Maybe he is.

24:37.611 --> 24:39.978
But I'm not.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.814
We're two and two.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.782
Rubber match.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.383
How is everything feeling?

24:46.385 --> 24:48.620
Like I've been abducted by aliens.

24:48.622 --> 24:50.154
I mean, are you sure it's working?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.990
It's a slow infusion.

24:51.992 --> 24:54.592
Half a teaspoon of the virus
directly into the tumor.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.594
How many times does she have to do this?

24:56.596 --> 24:58.062
Once. That's it.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.865
It seems so peaceful.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.934
Well, best case scenario,
everything stays just as it is,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.535
except for the tumor, of course,

25:05.537 --> 25:07.537
which will eventually shrink and disappear.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.640
Seems like voodoo to me.

25:10.446 --> 25:13.844
Well... what's happening?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.712
What is it, Dixie?

25:15.714 --> 25:17.814
The... the cards, they're-they're blurry.

25:17.816 --> 25:18.749
Doctor.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.750
Okay, I-I'm stopping the infusion.

25:19.752 --> 25:20.817
It's getting worse.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.120
- I'll page radiology.
- Is it the polio?

25:23.122 --> 25:24.087
Is it inside her?

25:24.089 --> 25:25.220
Oh, my god.

25:25.222 --> 25:27.222
Oh, my god, I-I-I can't see! I can't see!

25:34.867 --> 25:37.953
[monitor beeping]

25:44.928 --> 25:45.995
The tumor's expanded.

25:45.997 --> 25:47.864
It's compressing against her optic tract.

25:47.866 --> 25:49.364
Let's bring down the swelling.

25:49.366 --> 25:53.034
Dr. Sharpe, 20 of DEX and bolus,
200 CCS of mannitol.

25:53.036 --> 25:53.840
Mm-hmm.

25:53.890 --> 25:57.083
Even with the decompression,
the loss of vision could be permanent.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.674
Is it possible that the polio
breached the path to the tumor?

25:59.676 --> 26:00.675
No, it's not.

26:00.677 --> 26:01.910
With the parameters we set...

26:01.912 --> 26:03.475
Alex, I can't even entertain
this notion right now.

26:03.525 --> 26:05.480
If I do, that means Dixie's life is over,

26:05.482 --> 26:07.181
our careers, the hospital.

26:07.183 --> 26:08.682
Dr. Sharpe, is she stabilizing?

26:08.684 --> 26:09.683
Not yet.

26:09.685 --> 26:12.620
Pressure's still sky high.

26:12.622 --> 26:13.673
Damn it.

26:13.723 --> 26:15.355
I shouldn't have brought you in on this.

26:15.357 --> 26:16.891
Okay, that doesn't even matter right now.

26:16.893 --> 26:18.105
What matters is figuring out

26:18.155 --> 26:20.828
how to get Dixie out of this alive.

26:25.123 --> 26:27.193
Dana: Wow, that's a great picture.

26:27.388 --> 26:29.863
The woman in it looks really happy.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.624
[voice breaking] That's because she was.

26:34.476 --> 26:36.709
Her life was normal.

26:41.015 --> 26:44.375
Okay, stop me
if you've heard this before.

26:44.586 --> 26:49.007
But there is no black-and-white
definition of normal.

26:49.325 --> 26:51.766
Normal is subjective.

26:52.227 --> 26:57.529
It's a messy, inconsistent,
silly, hopeful version

26:57.531 --> 26:59.932
of how we feel most at home in our lives.

26:59.934 --> 27:02.701
Did you just make that up?

27:02.917 --> 27:04.703
No. [chuckles]

27:04.705 --> 27:06.939
It was Tori Spelling.

27:06.941 --> 27:07.906
- What?
- [laughs]

27:07.908 --> 27:10.042
I know, right?

27:10.044 --> 27:14.413
So, I guess now I have to admit
that I'm a reality TV junkie.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.581
Me too.

27:15.583 --> 27:16.681
- Are you?
- Yes.

27:16.731 --> 27:18.339
[laughs]

27:18.794 --> 27:21.252
I knew I liked you.

27:26.693 --> 27:32.054
Look, I know it's hard for you
to put yourself out there.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.228
But you just have to do it.

27:35.469 --> 27:38.069
'Cause I'm scared to think
of what's gonna happen to you

27:38.071 --> 27:39.070
if you don't.

27:39.072 --> 27:41.573
Nothing's gonna happen.

27:41.575 --> 27:44.909
No, that's the thing about reality.

27:44.911 --> 27:49.347
The one minute, you're fine.
The next, you're not.

27:49.349 --> 27:51.682
Nothing changes.

27:51.684 --> 27:54.652
Nothing stops.

27:54.654 --> 27:57.322
We affect nothing.

28:01.627 --> 28:07.032
Well, that's a little more
Nietzsche than Tori Spelling.

28:10.535 --> 28:12.369
Anyway, we are officially done here,

28:12.371 --> 28:16.873
so... come on, let me walk you out.

28:18.243 --> 28:19.709
Just because
you're getting out of here

28:19.711 --> 28:21.178
doesn't mean
you're getting rid of me.

28:21.180 --> 28:22.346
Don't worry.

28:22.348 --> 28:24.714
I have my next follow-up
in the next two weeks.

28:24.716 --> 28:26.150
Miss...

28:26.152 --> 28:27.684
Would you be so kind as to allow me

28:27.686 --> 28:29.286
to accompany you the rest of the way?

28:29.288 --> 28:31.755
[laughs] I'd be honored.

28:31.757 --> 28:32.756
Bye, honey.

28:32.758 --> 28:34.858
Bye.

28:34.860 --> 28:36.392
He's staring at me.

28:36.394 --> 28:37.928
You should be staring at <i>him.</i>

28:37.930 --> 28:41.631
white socks, black shoes? Please.

28:43.968 --> 28:45.835
Oh, my god.

28:45.837 --> 28:46.870
I'm so sorry.

28:46.872 --> 28:48.271
Hold up.

28:48.273 --> 28:50.139
Hey.

28:50.141 --> 28:52.641
Is that your mom in there?

28:52.643 --> 28:55.411
I'm gonna get someone
to look after you, okay?

28:56.780 --> 28:57.947
Are you all right?

28:57.949 --> 28:59.515
Yeah.

29:01.251 --> 29:02.485
Is everything okay?

29:09.659 --> 29:11.461
Did your mom get burned, too?

29:11.463 --> 29:15.163
She spilled a pot
of boiling water on herself.

29:15.165 --> 29:16.831
She needs an operation.

29:16.833 --> 29:21.069
It's got to be pretty scary
seeing her like that.

29:21.071 --> 29:23.238
Is she gonna look like that?

29:24.974 --> 29:27.175
It's all right.

29:27.177 --> 29:29.344
It's just skin.

29:29.346 --> 29:31.079
Do you want to touch it?

29:37.452 --> 29:39.753
Feels a little bit like play-doh.

29:39.755 --> 29:41.722
[laughs] Yes, it does.

29:43.225 --> 29:45.058
This is pretty.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.561
Thanks.

29:47.563 --> 29:50.097
You know, even though your
mom is gonna look different,

29:50.099 --> 29:53.134
she's-she's gonna go back
to being your mom in no time.

29:53.136 --> 29:55.269
How do you know?

29:55.271 --> 29:58.739
Because that's what
happens when we get sick.

29:58.741 --> 30:02.008
It doesn't change who we are.
It just makes us stronger.

30:02.010 --> 30:03.876
I hope so.

30:05.879 --> 30:08.548
Here.

30:08.550 --> 30:09.982
This is for your mom.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.436
How's coach?

30:31.438 --> 30:33.539
Fed in the catheter and blasted the clot.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.540
He's stable.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.008
Nice work.

30:36.010 --> 30:37.509
Thanks.

30:40.246 --> 30:42.281
I'm going to live.

30:42.283 --> 30:45.017
Yep, looks that way.

30:45.019 --> 30:46.919
That means I have to go back.

30:48.621 --> 30:50.222
I guess.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.491
To being someone I'm not.

30:55.895 --> 31:01.333
For the first time in my life,
I feel like me.

31:01.335 --> 31:03.468
And it's better than I ever imagined.

31:08.774 --> 31:10.209
What are you gonna tell Ty?

31:13.279 --> 31:15.514
The truth.

31:15.516 --> 31:21.552
I don't want to cause any more
damage... to me or to him.

31:24.022 --> 31:25.523
I think we're both ready.

31:31.663 --> 31:34.854
[monitor beeping]

31:35.020 --> 31:37.950
The blindness was caused
by swelling in the brain.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.337
From the polio?

31:39.339 --> 31:40.471
Not the polio,

31:40.473 --> 31:42.439
her brain's inflammatory response to it.

31:42.441 --> 31:44.474
Her immune system is attacking the tumor.

31:44.476 --> 31:46.276
Will she see again?

31:46.278 --> 31:48.578
Not that pressure is off her optic nerve,

31:48.580 --> 31:51.047
it's likely that her
vision will be restored.

31:51.049 --> 31:52.815
And the cancer?

31:52.817 --> 31:56.152
We won't know for a few weeks
if the growth has slowed.

31:56.154 --> 31:59.021
Gido.

31:59.023 --> 32:01.224
Kohana.

32:01.226 --> 32:03.226
Can you see me?

32:03.228 --> 32:05.828
I can see you.

32:05.830 --> 32:07.830
Hm, that's very good news.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.733
Good news?

32:09.735 --> 32:11.333
It's great news!

32:11.335 --> 32:13.502
Okay. [clears throat]

32:13.504 --> 32:15.805
Dixie will need constant
care and monitoring.

32:15.807 --> 32:18.007
It's my turn.

32:24.948 --> 32:26.448
Hey.

32:26.450 --> 32:29.018
What a day, but now I'm all yours.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.487
What's up?

32:31.489 --> 32:33.389
Hey, is this about earlier in the hall?

32:33.391 --> 32:34.757
With Cassie? Is she okay?

32:34.759 --> 32:36.524
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

32:36.526 --> 32:38.693
Uh... [clears throat]

32:38.695 --> 32:42.798
But, um, uh... I'm-I'm not.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.767
It's, um... it's back, Alex.

32:45.769 --> 32:48.103
The cancer's back.

32:49.672 --> 32:50.505
[sighs]

32:50.507 --> 32:51.372
Oh, my god.

32:51.374 --> 32:52.207
Yeah.

32:52.209 --> 32:53.608
Um...

32:53.610 --> 32:55.710
What can I do?

32:55.712 --> 32:57.712
[sighs] I know what you can't do.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.413
You can't give me that look,

32:59.415 --> 33:01.882
the "oh, you have cancer" look.

33:01.884 --> 33:04.084
It's still me. I'm still me, okay?

33:04.086 --> 33:05.452
Okay.

33:07.956 --> 33:09.756
Does Molly know?

33:17.532 --> 33:20.100
[sniffles, clears throat]

33:21.703 --> 33:24.205
No, not-not yet.

33:24.207 --> 33:25.972
Okay.

33:29.576 --> 33:30.743
Hey.

33:30.745 --> 33:32.511
What did I just tell you about that look?

33:32.513 --> 33:34.347
Right. Sorry.

33:34.349 --> 33:35.481
It's... it's gone. See?

33:35.483 --> 33:37.150
All gone.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.721
And one more thing, please?

33:41.723 --> 33:44.057
Don't tell anyone, okay?

33:44.059 --> 33:45.825
You know Cassie knows, but that's it.

33:45.827 --> 33:48.127
And, uh...

33:48.129 --> 33:51.564
I just need a couple of days to, um...

33:51.566 --> 33:53.165
just to get my head around it.

33:53.167 --> 33:55.334
Of course.

33:55.336 --> 33:56.601
Hey.

33:56.603 --> 33:58.203
Whatever you need.

33:58.205 --> 34:00.105
Great. Good.

34:00.107 --> 34:01.539
Okay.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.675
Ah. [chuckles]

34:05.879 --> 34:08.045
When he wakes up,
he's gonna need oxy for the pain

34:08.047 --> 34:09.882
and docusate for the constipation,

34:09.884 --> 34:12.083
and then I get to go home.

34:12.085 --> 34:15.187
And I get to scrub up for
my third bowel resection.

34:15.188 --> 34:16.853
But you're back in the O.R.

34:16.856 --> 34:18.755
Woman: <i>Code blue, I.C.U., room 4.</i>

34:18.757 --> 34:20.757
- <i>Code blue, ICU, room 4.</i>
- Is that Cal?

34:20.760 --> 34:23.060
Yes.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.395
[monitor beeping rapidly] Maggie, bag him.

34:24.397 --> 34:26.130
Yep.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.563
Where's that crash cart?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.233
Switch out. Switch out.

34:36.940 --> 34:37.974
[paddles whine]

34:37.976 --> 34:39.943
And clear.

34:43.647 --> 34:45.348
I got nothing.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.815
[paddles whine] Going again.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.784
And clear.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.722
[monitor flat lining]

34:52.724 --> 34:53.889
Still no pulse.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.591
[sighs]

34:58.795 --> 34:59.861
[paddles whine]

34:59.863 --> 35:00.996
Going again.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.197
Clear.

35:12.309 --> 35:15.311
Time of death, 6:32.

35:21.016 --> 35:22.851
Charlie.

35:23.753 --> 35:25.787
[sighs]

35:25.789 --> 35:28.089
I'm sorry.

35:29.592 --> 35:31.493
[sighs]

35:39.102 --> 35:41.161
It's all my fault.

35:42.229 --> 35:44.097
He's dead because of me.

35:44.099 --> 35:45.298
What?

35:45.300 --> 35:49.469
If I hadn't kept it a secret
about hating football,

35:49.471 --> 35:51.104
we wouldn't have been out on that field.

35:51.106 --> 35:52.205
Ty...

35:52.207 --> 35:54.708
He would still be here.

35:55.140 --> 35:58.343
My sweet boy.

35:58.345 --> 36:00.680
I never got to explain.

36:00.682 --> 36:04.817
Now I won't be there for you.

36:04.819 --> 36:07.653
I won't be able to protect you.

36:07.655 --> 36:12.692
[sighs] I should have
just told him the truth.

36:12.694 --> 36:16.829
You were protecting your dad's feelings.

36:16.831 --> 36:19.155
We do that for the people we love.

36:24.304 --> 36:27.706
Those pills...

36:27.708 --> 36:30.875
they weren't steroids, were they?

36:38.818 --> 36:41.019
No.

36:41.021 --> 36:42.987
No, they weren't.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.193
[sighs]

36:48.195 --> 36:52.530
I guess it was hard for him
to tell me the truth, too.

36:58.403 --> 37:01.372
[voice breaking] I loved him so much.

37:07.212 --> 37:09.780
[sobs]

37:30.969 --> 37:32.776
Knock knock.

37:33.538 --> 37:36.473
I have a stack of RFPs to
review before 8:00 A.M.

37:36.475 --> 37:38.575
Don't tell anyone, okay?

37:38.577 --> 37:42.379
Oh, your secret is safe with me, chief.

37:42.381 --> 37:44.147
We made a pretty good team in there today.

37:44.149 --> 37:46.916
Hmm. [speaks french]
Plus Ã§a change, plus c'est pareil.

37:46.918 --> 37:48.291
Well, the weight of the world

37:48.341 --> 37:50.787
is about to be
lifted off your shoulders.

37:50.789 --> 37:53.556
You know, I'm gonna miss this job, Alex.

37:53.558 --> 37:55.858
I like the added responsibility.

37:55.860 --> 37:57.894
It's a lot to worry about.

37:57.896 --> 38:00.497
Well, you have Charlie and Luke.

38:00.499 --> 38:04.301
Who you haven't visited in
a few weeks, by the way.

38:04.303 --> 38:07.804
Yeah, I suppose it's time
to teach him some chess.

38:09.817 --> 38:12.542
So, we're good?

38:12.544 --> 38:15.211
Oh, we're better than good.

38:15.213 --> 38:16.679
We're team Shalex.

38:16.681 --> 38:18.747
[laughs]

38:18.749 --> 38:20.482
Thank you.

Good night.

You're still here.

40:54.567 --> 40:57.134
Yeah. Yeah.

40:57.136 --> 40:58.902
You too.

41:01.273 --> 41:02.340
Hard day?

41:02.342 --> 41:05.509
- [sighs]
- You could say that, yeah.

41:06.979 --> 41:09.546
You want to talk about it?

41:16.154 --> 41:17.921
Okay, here goes.

41:20.425 --> 41:23.556
I see ghosts, and I know you do, too.

Now do you want to talk about it?

[sighs]

41:35.693 --> 41:37.510
So...

41:39.543 --> 41:42.201
you were saying it was a hard day...

41:42.614 --> 41:44.634
Because of the cat lady?

No.

41:55.492 --> 41:58.417
No, it wasn't because of the, uh...

cat lady.
