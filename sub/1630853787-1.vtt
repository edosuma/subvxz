00:01.042 --> 00:03.712
Last season on High School Musical:
The Musical: <i>The Series...</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:08.925
Who is ready to go from amateur thespians
to statewide award winners?

00:09.009 --> 00:12.178
I didn't actually expect to become
a theater kid for real this time...

00:12.262 --> 00:15.181
You are looking
at East High's newest Beast.

00:15.265 --> 00:19.477
-I got Belle! I'm Belle!
-But there was something in the air.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.062
<i>There's somethin' in the air</i>

00:21.896 --> 00:25.775
<i>About to go off right now</i>
<i>Lighten up all around</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:27.986
<i>I feel it comin'</i>
<i>Somethin' in the air</i>

00:28.236 --> 00:29.320
And we all just wanted a home.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.657
I guess I feel a little bit like
a square peg in a star-shaped hole...

00:32.741 --> 00:35.368
-Is this where you tell me we're moving?
-Just to a smaller apartment.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.661
Welcome home, roomie!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.749
-Things didn't always go to plan.
-I didn't get into Duke.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.043
Honey, what happened?
Did the bus get stuck in the ice?

00:43.126 --> 00:45.170
No, um... I couldn't go back.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.506
-I don't know what's going on with you.
-I did not come home for you.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.469
<i>I won't be confined</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:56.014
<i>To your point of view</i>

00:56.097 --> 00:57.682
But when there was trouble up north...

00:58.183 --> 01:00.435
-The plan is simple.
-Dance-off.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.270
<i>Through a mist, through a wood</i>

01:02.353 --> 01:05.190
<i>Something's lurking</i>
<i>that you don't see every day</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:06.900
We found our way east.

01:07.067 --> 01:13.031
<i>But these are the moments</i>
<i>That I'm gonna remember most, yeah</i>

01:13.114 --> 01:16.451
<i>Just gotta keep going</i>
<i>And I</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
Are we breaking up?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.622
<i>I gotta be strong</i>

01:20.705 --> 01:22.957
By showtime, we were on fire.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.752
<i>...fat and lazy</i>
<i>You walked in and oops-a-daisy</i>

01:25.835 --> 01:27.420
<i>It's a guest! It's a guest!</i>

01:27.504 --> 01:29.089
<i>Sakes alive</i>
<i>Oh, I'll be blessed</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:31.049
RICKY: <i>We may have had</i>
<i>some rivals along the way.</i>

01:31.132 --> 01:32.133
What's wrong?

01:32.217 --> 01:33.802
-My harness is missing.
-MISS JENN: What?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.597
But this summer's
all about second chances.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.058
EJ! Can I kiss you?

01:40.141 --> 01:41.601
Hey, Lily.

01:41.684 --> 01:46.022
And love is an open door.
Did I just make that up? It's pretty good.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.318
(HORN HONKING)

01:50.401 --> 01:52.153
EJ: Let's go. Let's go.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.489
Last one in's a rotten egg.
And that's no yolk.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.951
Ugh! He's on a dad joke kick 'cause
he's taking us all on a road trip.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.412
That is completely false,
and I just have one question.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.082
What's orange and sounds like a parrot?

02:04.749 --> 02:05.875
(SIGHS)

02:06.501 --> 02:07.544
A carrot.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.003
(LAUGHS)

02:09.087 --> 02:10.296
Is he okay?

02:10.380 --> 02:13.049
Just for a final headcount,
who's not here?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.134
Big Red's gotta work.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.427
-Sebbie's gotta milk.
-Nini's with her moms.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.304
-And Ricky's with...
-(HONKS HORN)

02:20.098 --> 02:21.141
We don't say her name.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.603
And why are you all coming to the world's
greatest camp for two weeks?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
ALL: Because there's a secret celebrity!

02:28.690 --> 02:30.483
Oh. I was actually looking for

02:30.567 --> 02:34.487
''Because we all love each other,"
and something, something "Wildcats!"

02:34.821 --> 02:35.864
Yes.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.576
-Gina, come on.
-KOURTNEY: There she is.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.619
ASHLYN: Okay, braids!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.246
CARLOS: Gina!

02:47.542 --> 02:48.668
What'd you wish for?

02:49.043 --> 02:51.796
Well, if I told you that,
then who knows what could happen?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.466
-Let's go!
-Whoo!

02:55.550 --> 02:56.843
Summer.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.179
-EJ: Summer.
-Summer.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.389
-Summer.
-Summer!

03:03.975 --> 03:06.519
ALL: <i>What time is it?</i>
<i>Summertime</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:08.188
<i>It's our vacation</i>

03:08.271 --> 03:10.148
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>Party time</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:12.192
<i>That's right</i>
<i>Say it aloud</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:13.443
<i>What time is it?</i>

03:13.526 --> 03:16.446
<i>Time of our lives</i>
<i>Anticipation</i>

03:16.529 --> 03:18.948
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>Summertime</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:20.825
<i>School's out</i>
<i>Scream and shout</i>

03:20.909 --> 03:22.285
<i>Finally, summer's here</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:24.704
<i>-Good to be chilling out</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:26.789
<i>I'm off the clock</i>
<i>The pressure's off</i>

03:26.873 --> 03:28.958
<i>Now my girl's what it's all about</i>

03:29.042 --> 03:32.879
<i>-Ready for some sunshine</i>
<i>-For my heart to take a chance</i>

03:32.962 --> 03:34.923
<i>I'm here to stay</i>
<i>Not moving away</i>

03:35.006 --> 03:37.300
<i>Ready for a summer romance</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:40.053
<i>Everybody ready</i>
<i>Going crazy</i>

03:40.136 --> 03:41.221
<i>Yeah, we're out</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:45.475
<i>Come on and let me hear you say it now</i>
<i>Right now</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:47.685
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>Start the party</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:49.938
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>Start the party</i>

03:50.021 --> 03:51.856
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>It's time to party</i>

03:51.940 --> 03:55.235
<i>That's what this summer's all about</i>

03:55.318 --> 03:58.071
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>It's summertime</i>

03:58.154 --> 04:00.323
<i>It's time to start</i>
<i>Start the party</i>

04:00.406 --> 04:02.450
<i>Let's celebrate</i>
<i>Come on and sing</i>

04:02.533 --> 04:04.285
<i>-What you waiting for now?</i>
-(ALL WHOOPING)

04:04.369 --> 04:06.454
<i>What time is it?</i>
<i>It's party time</i>

04:06.537 --> 04:08.456
<i>Start, start, start the party</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:11.751
<i>Let's go and have the time of our lives!</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:20.885
Camp Shallow Lake, y'all. My second home.

04:20.969 --> 04:24.264
-Don't you have a second home?
-No, my second second-home.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.390
Come on.

04:25.682 --> 04:30.937
Seriously, I came to this camp an athlete
and became an athlete-actor.

04:31.020 --> 04:35.733
You come to Shallow Lake one way
and you just become something else.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.654
-It happens to everyone, though.
-Wow. And I thought this was a vacation.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.993
Are those Wildcats I see?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.372
-What's up, Rocket Man?
-How you doing, Gadget?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.625
-What language are they using?
-I don't know.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.710
Ready for a good summer?

04:53.793 --> 04:54.836
-Yeah, dude.
-Yeah.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.714
All right, it's five minutes in
and I already miss Seb.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.133
Oh, and I miss Biggie.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.218
Remember how we said
we weren't gonna do that?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.972
This is our Wildcat summer adventure
and we're going angst-less.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.182
I just feel naked without my angst.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.518
All right. I'm just gonna need to collect

05:10.601 --> 05:12.770
your phones, snacks
and all electronic devices.

05:12.854 --> 05:17.108
Basically, anything that brings you joy.
I'm only half kidding.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.779
But, you know, it's actually pretty great
once you get past the withdrawal.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.116
You'll have so much fun,
you won't miss your phone.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.370
(SHUDDERS)

05:29.537 --> 05:33.291
-Hey, it's only for two weeks.
-But Sasha doesn't know that.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.209
Sasha is your phone.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.088
I just got her, Carlos. She's too young
to understand what any of this means.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.680
-Don't look back.
-(SOBS) Mama loves you!

05:47.805 --> 05:49.098
Oh, don't do that.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.316
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

05:59.734 --> 06:02.153
Richie, have you seen my cocoa butter?

06:02.236 --> 06:05.531
-Have you tried the kitchen?
-It's a skincare product.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.241
Well, it sounds delicious.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.329
Hey. I know you're hungry, but we will be
on the road to Jackson Hole soon, okay?

06:11.496 --> 06:16.042
Ugh, I can't wait.
I'm literally #JacksonGoals.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.214
Sorry. Road trips and dad jokes.
It's a thing.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.384
You are funny.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.557
So, yeah. Lily.
We've been hanging out a little bit.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.976
She's really nice when
she's not around the French kid.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.645
Or I think she will be soon.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.648
The point is,
it's been kind of a downer year

06:38.731 --> 06:40.191
and I'm just trying to go with

06:40.274 --> 06:43.027
whatever has the best shot
at making me feel free.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.614
And, yes, summer camp sounded sweet.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.952
But jet skiing in Jackson Hole
with Lily from North High

06:51.035 --> 06:52.829
and her parents just makes sense.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.123
I think it makes sense.

06:56.332 --> 07:00.920
And four tubs
of industrial-strength sculpting gel

07:01.087 --> 07:04.006
guaranteed to hold
your "hurr" in a hurricane.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.550
It smells like a tree.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.635
-Are you ready to go?
-Yes, yes.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.430
Right after we do
just a couple more TikToks.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.809
Okay. Now remember, I just happened to be
dancing perfectly in front of you, right?

07:14.892 --> 07:17.937
And you're all, like, "What?"

07:18.396 --> 07:21.149
Okay. Places.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.778
(DOORBELL RINGING)

07:29.115 --> 07:31.826
-Nini!
-Surprise!

07:31.909 --> 07:34.579
I thought your moms were gonna
bring over the summer stuff.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.708
-Well, I was in the neighborhood, so...
-Come on in.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.172
-It's so cute.
-You're so cute.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.968
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. Just got this big trip coming up.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.097
-Sounds like you do too with Mr. Bowen.
-(CHUCKLES)

07:53.181 --> 07:59.437
Well, I'm a Utah girl, so a week-long
Caribbean cruise just makes sense.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.982
You know, your face doesn't match
the words you're saying.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.651
It's simple. He likes me, I like him.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.822
He likes the open water, I like him.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.407
(CHUCKLES)

08:11.491 --> 08:14.118
Yeah, sounds like a work-in-progress.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.455
What about your trip?

08:18.456 --> 08:22.001
Uh, yeah, my moms
are taking me to Southern California,

08:22.084 --> 08:24.462
which is where they met,
and apparently where I was born.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.005
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:26.088 --> 08:32.053
But hey. Maybe a road trip with two
40-year-olds that love true-crime podcasts

08:32.136 --> 08:36.057
and stopping at every Panera Bread
along the way is just what I need.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.267
It's gonna be fine.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.522
You know, your face doesn't match
the words you're saying.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.150
-Yeah.
-I'll make tea.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.572
Wow.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.784
-It's not bad, right?
-Yeah, it's everything you promised.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.827
It's the best summer ever.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.247
And just wait till you meet
the celebrity guest.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.666
Okay, since you refuse
to give any clues at all,

09:01.749 --> 09:04.168
I'm just gonna go ahead
and assume it's Gloria Steinem.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.381
-I'm going with Oprah because Oprah.
-Legally, I'm obliged to say Greta Gerwig.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.508
It's all going down
at the amphitheater tonight.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.510
You guys are gonna be all
"Damn-phitheater."

09:14.762 --> 09:16.138
He's sorry.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.767
It's just hitting me now that you two
are gonna be a thing all summer.

09:20.309 --> 09:24.564
Well, as a thing-in-law,
I have never been prouder.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.731
(LAUGHS)

09:25.815 --> 09:30.027
Okay, so, basketball is over there.
The pool is behind me.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.155
And if you all follow my gaze
to the south here,

09:33.239 --> 09:36.450
you will see the Camp Shallow Lake
barn and playhouse,

09:36.534 --> 09:38.911
where young EJ has played such roles as

09:38.995 --> 09:43.624
Danny Zuko, of course, the dentist
from <i>Little Shop,</i> and the Music Man.

09:44.417 --> 09:48.629
Speaking of rotten eggs, yes,
I know what you did last summer.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.425
And that concludes the tour.
Now, if you'll follow me this way...

09:57.013 --> 10:00.141
Yes, it's my first camp,
my first boyfriend,

10:00.224 --> 10:03.394
my first time really going out
for the lead in a show.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.982
It's my summer of firsts
and I am so excited. (LAUGHS)

10:11.152 --> 10:12.361
First mosquito.

10:14.322 --> 10:19.744
Boys' bunk, girls' bunk, mountains, ocean,
and sometimes there's bears.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.662
Got it.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.000
Okay, I will see you all tonight
for the big announcement. One more thing.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.008
-How many days has it been?
-Ten minutes.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.551
-Ugh!
-Mmm.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.886
(GIGGLES)

10:40.181 --> 10:46.312
-Oh! This is deeply round.
-Six sides is some next-level feng shui.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.523
-And some zero-level privacy.
-Wait. Okay.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.319
Should we spread out our bed assignments
or do the new-girl cluster?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.237
-I want the top bunk.
-I want the top bunk.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.989
-I want the bottom.
-I want the top bunk.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.366
-I want that one.
-Okay.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.533
(ALL LAUGHING)

11:02.203 --> 11:03.204
Wow.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.831
Guys, I can't believe
so many of us showed up for this.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.834
Yeah. I mean your boy EJ
talked a pretty big game.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.755
I was expecting, you know,
more a Four Seasons-y vibe.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.591
He gets so excited when he describes camp.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.927
And the only reason
I never joined him is 'cause

11:18.010 --> 11:20.805
I spent the last six summers
LARPing in Minnesota.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.268
Live-action roleplay? Anyone?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.437
Oh!

11:28.521 --> 11:31.691
We're gonna learn a lot
about each other this summer, aren't we?

11:31.941 --> 11:35.027
My best character is
a sewing wench from Gondor.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.324
Okay. I'm gonna check out the restroom.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.368
Ooh! And now I've done that.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.371
Come on, Kourt.
This is gonna be a great summer.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.956
This guy I know promised.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.458
-(LAUGHS)
-I'm glad you've got someone here,

11:49.542 --> 11:52.211
but Howie's off to college,
Nini's on the road,

11:52.294 --> 11:53.921
my mom's a little too old for camp.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.007
And we'll be right beside you every day.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.510
(ALL CHUCKLE)

12:00.928 --> 12:03.597
Yes, my ladies in the Honeycomb.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.809
-Once again, I'm Maddox.
-I thought your name was Gadget.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.353
Ooh! No, yeah, it is also Gadget.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.022
Yes, my camp name.
Everyone gets one. It's super fun.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.649
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:13.733 --> 12:15.860
Oh, um, that is actually my bed.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.612
Yeah, I made some deep memories
in that one over the years.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.281
I actually knocked out my two front teeth

12:20.364 --> 12:22.783
in that bulletin board during
a massive pillow fight.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.911
It is all yours. All good. I am out.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.038
Oh, thanks.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.545
So, lot of new faces.
Couple of non-Wildcats in the corner.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.506
Who's got secrets?

12:40.843 --> 12:43.387
So, what's on your mind?

12:43.471 --> 12:45.931
Okay, so, you know how
I'm working with Gina's brother?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.725
I do. Fancy music producer.

12:47.808 --> 12:51.270
Yeah. And he wants me
to write a song a day.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.272
Okay. How many have you written?

12:53.981 --> 12:59.278
I mean, I just have one
and it has no words or title yet.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.115
I just feel like I'm missing a spark.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.036
Okay, I'm going to be your teacher
for a second and go through my list.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.413
-Are you sleeping?
-Mmm-hmm.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.123
Hydrated?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.168
-Is anyone ever truly hydrated?
-That is wise.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.339
Honey, is there something else?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.718
Honestly, it just feels like
these last few years

13:22.802 --> 13:27.223
have been leading up to
something really good or big,

13:28.140 --> 13:30.476
but I can't name it
or put my finger on it.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.271
-Like a song with no title?
-Yeah, I guess.

13:34.855 --> 13:39.652
And, I mean, California's really
pretty and it's big. And I like big.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.530
But I'm missing camp for this.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.241
And it's a camp
I've had so many memories at.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.661
And, look, my moms gave me
the choice and I made it.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.914
I guess I'm just not sure
I made the right one.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.376
-Is anyone ever?
-Yeah.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.088
And I'm excited to go home or,
you know, whatever this is,

14:00.172 --> 14:03.467
but right when I'm about
to start creating stuff that's mine...

14:03.634 --> 14:05.553
(SIGHS)

14:05.636 --> 14:11.058
I guess I'm just wondering if this
whole trip might be way too disruptive.

14:13.811 --> 14:18.148
Well, as someone who has been through
a few thousand curveballs...

14:18.232 --> 14:19.316
(NINI LAUGHS)

14:19.400 --> 14:22.444
...I can say that
if you're looking for a spark,

14:24.613 --> 14:27.908
sometimes "disruptive"
isn't such a bad thing.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.536
Hmm.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.163
Yeah. I'll try to remember that.

14:33.789 --> 14:38.669
And I am going to use these
every single day out there on the sea.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.588
(LAUGHS)

14:40.671 --> 14:43.382
-Well, thanks, Miss Jenn.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.762
All right. It's time to hit the road.
Thank you.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.099
-See you later.
-Be safe.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.020
And take big risks.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.149
I think we're ready to hit the road.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.026
-You mean it?
-Yeah. (LAUGHS)

15:02.109 --> 15:04.945
Hey, I know it's a leap of faith
to skip out on the big camp thing

15:05.029 --> 15:07.072
and spend a couple of weeks
on the lake with me.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.158
I want you to know
that I don't take it lightly.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.494
-I don't either.
-We're all in this together. Okay?

15:13.829 --> 15:14.914
You can bet on it.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.583
You know you don't have to
talk in song titles, right?

15:18.459 --> 15:19.877
What song titles?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.756
-Okay.
-(CHUCKLES POLITELY)

15:24.423 --> 15:26.842
Oh! Hang on. I gotta find my keys.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.969
I think I dropped them
during TikTok number nine.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.304
Okay.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.100
Sorry.

15:36.310 --> 15:40.230
Is this my Beast harness?

15:40.981 --> 15:43.484
-From opening night?
-Yeah, I can explain that.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.655
Okay. Explain.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.908
Oh, you mean now?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.375
CRASH: New dude, catch.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.173
Okay. Constant danger and I live here.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.468
-What's your name?
-I'm Carlos. I'm a friend of EJ's.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.887
I choreograph,
and I just peed a little bit.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.183
-And you are?
-Johnny, but everyone calls me Crash.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.896
-Hey! First crash of the summer.
-(LAUGHS) Guilty, my dude.

16:22.314 --> 16:27.361
-Carlos, I am so glad you found the bunk.
-I'm so glad that you are glad.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.238
Just pick a bed, take a load off.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.825
I'm actually the CIT for this bunk, so...
That's counselor in training.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.536
I'm gonna need everyone
to follow all of the rules to the letter.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.749
I'm just kidding, you guys. I'm, like,
six months older than some of you,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.459
and this is my last chance to be a kid.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.378
So, good vibes only this summer, okay?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.840
New kid, right? You must be Jet.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.343
-Okay.
-I'm EJ. This is Carlos.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.055
Yeah, I'm actually good without talking,
but you do you.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.058
-That's my bed.
-Okay.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.310
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

17:00.894 --> 17:02.062
I'm scared.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.988
(SCOFFS)

17:11.071 --> 17:14.283
-How could I be so stupid?
-Okay. I mean, you're not that stupid.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.745
I had actually convinced myself
that I was wrong about you.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.288
Kinda seems like you were.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.290
-Come on, Richie...
-It's Ricky.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.751
All is fair in love and war,
and musicals, right?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.294
I mean, Zackey Roy taught us that.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.880
Yeah, well, Miss Jenn taught us
to trust the process.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.590
Or at least, our fellow humans.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.800
Okay. So maybe this is our process, right?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.470
I steal things and you get mad,
and we laugh and laugh.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.517
-Plus, jet skiing.
-Bye, Lily.

17:43.395 --> 17:47.066
-What? Richie, come on.
-At least say Richard.

just a little bit more exciting.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.506
and why is isn't it one
of the Real Housewives?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.133
You guys, I don't wanna oversell it.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.510
To me, a celebrity is someone
who gets a bunch of questions

20:20.594 --> 20:21.720
about their skincare regimen.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.641
(LAUGHS) And I just learned
that I am a celebrity.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.603
Well, I may need a couple of tips because,
go figure, bonfires make me jumpy.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.272
Oh, Kourt, what are we doing
out here in the boonies?

experience that I really hope is worth it.

so I can google some camp life hacks.

your lucky V. Hudge phone?

-Do you know where I can mail this?
-Oh, yeah. I'll take it.

20:57.714 --> 21:02.010
Ooh! It's, like, a special sealed letter.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.930
I'm going to the office later.
That's where they go.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.557
Great. It says "Do not bend," by the way.

-Very.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.106
We are deeply in love,
and I will be writing to him every day.

-Is that funny?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.238
Oh, no. It's just a camp thing.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.073

come in saying that,

21:23.156 --> 21:26.785
and then by the end, life has other plans.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.331
-That's not me.
-Oh, I didn't say it was.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.044

Now, I know the reason
we have many new faces here

24:40.020 --> 24:41.730
is because of the exciting news.

24:41.980 --> 24:46.151
This summer, Camp Shallow Lake has been
selected for a very special opportunity,

24:46.234 --> 24:50.572
and to tell you all about it,
here comes a very familiar face.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.741
-Are you ready?
-What did you do?

24:52.824 --> 24:55.952
Mr. Corbin Bleu.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.996
-(ALL CHEERING)
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

25:07.172 --> 25:08.173
Light 'em up.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.969
Oh! (LAUGHS)

25:13.053 --> 25:17.933
Yes. What, what? What, what?

25:20.018 --> 25:23.271
Oh, I am so excited to be here
at Camp Shallow Lake.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.524
-(GASPING)
-Wow!

25:25.607 --> 25:29.528
You guys, I can't wait to tell you
about what we've got planned this summer.

25:29.611 --> 25:34.574
My pals at the House of Mouse have
given us the keys to the Magic Kingdom.

25:34.866 --> 25:40.163
And that means you guys are gonna be
the first camp on the planet

25:40.247 --> 25:45.502
to premiere a global blockbuster
which became a Broadway sensation.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.381
Does anyone have a jacket?
It suddenly got cold in here.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.925
I suppose.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.510
We're gonna put on <i>Frozen!</i>

25:53.593 --> 25:55.095
(ALL CHEERING)

25:55.220 --> 25:56.304
Oh, it's a bit.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.140
-Wait. Really?
-Oh, my God.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.268
-Best summer ever.
-CORBIN: Very excited.

26:01.351 --> 26:04.729
Are you telling me
that I get to meet Corbin Bleu?

26:04.813 --> 26:07.107
-(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
-And there's more.

26:07.899 --> 26:12.821
So, this camp was chosen by
Disney Theatrical's licensing agent, MTI,

26:12.904 --> 26:17.200
to do the first ever production
of this <i>Frozen</i> script

26:17.701 --> 26:20.412
in advance of the release
of licensing rights

26:20.495 --> 26:21.871
to high schools everywhere.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.499
Well, that rolled right off the tongue.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.669
And this camera is gonna be
following us all around

26:27.752 --> 26:31.464
because we're also making
a documentary about the show,

26:31.548 --> 26:34.175
-and it's gonna premiere on Disney+.
-(ALL GASP)

26:34.259 --> 26:36.344
And it's gonna break the Internet.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.680
(ALL CHEERING)

26:38.763 --> 26:40.098
It's very meta, you guys.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.309
Hang on. Is that camera
gonna be here all summer?

26:42.601 --> 26:43.935
Well, not in the yurts.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.814
Wow, I just realized why that health form
we filled out was, like, 20 pages long.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.401
-I think I signed a release.
-I knew I should've read that thing.

26:51.484 --> 26:55.447
And hey. I know there are some
real live Wildcats out there.

26:57.574 --> 27:01.119
And I look forward to signing headshots
for you all later this summer.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.204
'Cause it's all going down
at Shallow Lake.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.625
-So watch this space.
-CAMPER: Okay.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.710
(ALL CHEERING)

27:10.128 --> 27:12.547
Thank you so much.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.382
Thank you.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.344
-I don't remember how to breathe.
-I don't remember how to worry.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.306
I'll see all your beautiful faces later.
Thank you.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.850
CAMPERS: (CHANTING)
Corbin! Corbin! Corbin!

27:23.933 --> 27:27.937
-Oh, my gosh. Carlos, are you okay?
-It's better than Greta Gerwig.

27:35.695 --> 27:39.032
-Where did he go?
-One sec. One sec.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.452
Nailed it, my dude. You were born to host.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.579
Feeling good. Feeling good.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.082
I think we got
what we need for episode one.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.168
Excuse me. What's with the chopper?

27:51.086 --> 27:55.256
Dewey, right? We'll be back in a few days.
We'll get shots of rehearsal and whatnot.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.966
More atmosphere. It's gonna be fire.

27:57.050 --> 28:02.055
We were under the impression
that you'd be directing the show.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.849
Man. I should've been filming.
That's hilarious.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.104
"Hi. I'm Corbin Bleu. I have time in
my schedule to direct a camp musical."

28:09.562 --> 28:12.273
I love it, though. I love it.
You're great. I love it, man.

28:13.817 --> 28:17.987
Friend, I'm gonna be directing,
producing and hosting

28:18.071 --> 28:20.365
the show about the show, okay?

28:20.448 --> 28:22.450
I'm not directing the musical.
That's crazy.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.245
This way makes sense. Don't you guys
have someone who could do it?

28:25.328 --> 28:28.206
No. Our director of 40 years
quit this morning

28:28.289 --> 28:29.708
when he heard you guys were coming.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.877
-Shoot him a text.
-He's on a boat to Alaska.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.714
Oh. That sounds far.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.175
Anyway, good luck.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.392
Yeah, I mean, all of our
other counselors are sports folk.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.853
We can't even carry a tune, but...

28:51.688 --> 28:54.899
What am I gonna do? Think, Dewey, think.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.365
Rocket Man.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.618
Uh... Me? (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

29:05.702 --> 29:06.995
-You know the program.
-Hold on.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.290
You know every inch of this camp.
You know a lot of those loud new kids.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.043
Mr. Wood, this was supposed to be
the greatest summer of my life.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.255
Then make it happen, Mr. Director.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.270
Bye, Salt Lake.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.440
Hey. What did I miss?

29:36.024 --> 29:39.778
Uh, small change of plans
in the celebrity arrangement.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.405
But nothing is gonna ruin
our perfect summer together.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.784
I'm the guy who shows up, remember?
Nothing's gonna get in our way.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.702
Who said anybody would?

29:49.871 --> 29:50.914
Excuse me.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.044
Do you have room for one more?

29:57.754 --> 29:59.130
(CHUCKLES)

30:02.759 --> 30:03.843
Group hug?

30:03.968 --> 30:04.969
(ENGINE STARTING)

30:14.479 --> 30:16.606
