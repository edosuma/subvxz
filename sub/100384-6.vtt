So my buddy, Billy Tyson,

07:50.170 --> 07:52.710
he's a funny guy,
he's a great guy,

07:52.710 --> 07:54.790
he's coming over,
and he hates your guts.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.960
I've never met a Billy Tyson.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.790
All right, so maybe he doesn't
hate you,

08:00.790 --> 08:02.500
but he hates the idea of you.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.790
So me and him came up
in the 126,

08:04.790 --> 08:06.790
and then he was on a year-long
personal leave

08:06.790 --> 08:09.050
when we lost everybody,

08:09.050 --> 08:10.840
so he threw his hat in the ring
to rebuild the house,

08:10.840 --> 08:13.750
you got the job,
now he's captain over at 121.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.170
121?
Downtown?

08:16.170 --> 08:18.050
That's the biggest station
in Travis County.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.790
Worked out better for him.

08:19.790 --> 08:20.960
Yeah, you could say that.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.750
So it'll be a little awkward,

08:22.750 --> 08:23.790
but probably not personal.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.460
Okay, my Lyft is here.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.550
You're all playing nice, yes?

08:30.590 --> 08:33.789
Bye, Captain.

Thanks for dropping a deuce
on us, Judd.

08:41.419 --> 08:42.960
I'm out.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.300

08:49.790 --> 08:51.630
Ronnie, do the smart thing.
Just fold already.

We all know Eileen will have
your nuts in a jar

08:53.790 --> 08:55.630

all your money.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.090
YVETTE: Take it easy, Billy.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.630
We don't want
all of his hair falling out.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.000
I fold.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.210
Hey, Jim, I know we just met,

09:02.210 --> 09:03.800
but it's not too late
to fix that.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.840
Fix what?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.790
Male pattern baldness does not
have to be your destiny.

09:07.790 --> 09:10.630
I have a doctor here,
Dr. Akopian.

09:10.630 --> 09:12.710
All right, let's focus.

09:12.710 --> 09:13.880
Like a hair doctor?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.300
Like a hair savior.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.840
Hey, New York,

09:16.840 --> 09:18.210
call, raise, or fold.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.420
Raise 600.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.800
Oh, the no-look.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.210
Oh, man, that was cold-blooded.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.710
Careful, Captain.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.750
Wouldn't want you to go

09:25.750 --> 09:27.630
spending all your
beauty supply money.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.550
Judd tells me this guy's
spending more time

09:30.550 --> 09:31.800
in front of the mirror
than Faith Hill.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.420
(laughter)

09:33.420 --> 09:35.670
Thanks, Judd.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.670
Those weren't exactly my words,
but--

09:37.670 --> 09:40.130
it is kind of a long time.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.790
BILLY: Yeah, me,
I don't bother too much

09:42.790 --> 09:45.090
with surface-level concerns
like appearances.

09:45.090 --> 09:48.090
Yeah, the camo hat
made the point for you.

Relax, you're not in trouble.

11:38.420 --> 11:41.170

11:41.170 --> 11:42.790
His academy exam's coming up.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.300
I heard.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.960
He was like a walking tension
headache the other night.

I want you to be
his study buddy,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.630
on-shift, off-shift,
round the clock,

11:49.630 --> 11:51.790
till he takes that test.

11:51.790 --> 11:52.790
Like a babysitting detail?

11:52.790 --> 11:54.590
Look, you had the highest
scores

11:54.590 --> 11:55.500
of anybody in this house

11:55.500 --> 11:56.790
when you took the test
in Miami.

11:56.790 --> 11:57.800
You only missed one question.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.840
That's better than I did.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.340
I appealed that, actually,
and they amended it.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.420
Don't gloat.
It's unseemly.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.670
I'm just saying,
nobody held my hand

12:03.670 --> 12:05.090
when I was a probie.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.790
Chavez is severely dyslexic.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.460
I had him tested
when I hired him.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.000
But thanks to the Americans
With Disabilities Act,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.210
now the department
has to let him take it orally.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.630
That's a good thing, right?

12:14.630 --> 12:16.210
He still has 300 pages
of material to get through.

12:16.210 --> 12:18.460

12:18.460 --> 12:21.790

-I did not spin!
-Yeah, you did.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.550
No.

12:50.550 --> 12:51.790

chapter and verse

12:51.790 --> 12:52.790
when I was 18.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.130
This isn't a refresher.
It's for the probie.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.790
He has his final academy exam

12:55.790 --> 12:57.710
so everybody has some reading
to do.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.460
And what are we gonna do?
Teach him by osmosis?

13:00.460 --> 13:03.340
Besides, I just started
this book.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.800
Probie's dyslexic.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.590

13:08.590 --> 13:10.090

to pass the test

13:10.090 --> 13:12.380

13:12.380 --> 13:15.710
What do you need us to do?

13:15.710 --> 13:17.210
Everybody is going
to record themselves

13:17.210 --> 13:18.790
reading a different section
of the manual

13:18.790 --> 13:20.790
for him to listen to.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.380
TK, on-the-job scenarios,

13:22.380 --> 13:24.130
Paul, mathematics,

13:24.130 --> 13:25.750
and Judd, fire science.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.210
No, how come I have to do
the boring chemistry part?

13:28.210 --> 13:30.790
Because with that drawl,

13:30.790 --> 13:32.380
you read the slowest.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.790
All right, I'm gonna need
those audio files

13:34.790 --> 13:36.420
by end of shift, so everybody
warm up those pipes

13:36.420 --> 13:39.210

13:39.210 --> 13:43.130
"Sodium is an example

14:44.130 --> 14:45.920

at a higher level

14:53.420 --> 14:54.710

15:21.790 --> 15:22.840

-Gabby, sir.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.790
We were walking home
from the bus stop,

16:41.790 --> 16:43.000

16:43.000 --> 16:44.800
All right, you're being
very brave.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.790

We're gonna come get you, okay?

16:46.790 --> 16:49.460

Hey, if y'all give me
ten minutes,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.590
I can get animal control
out here with the tranq gun.

16:54.590 --> 16:57.590
Just hang on a second.

16:57.590 --> 16:59.090
You see, his hackles aren't up.

16:59.090 --> 17:02.500
His ears are down.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.170
You see how he's moving around
like that?

17:04.170 --> 17:06.170
That's not a scary dog.
That's a dog that's scared.

17:06.170 --> 17:08.790
Nah, it's plenty scary.

you guys move around

17:10.710 --> 17:13.250

so much about dogs?

Well, I think you had one
today.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.880
Is he impaled?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.340
No, but I think he might
be crushed.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.590

-I'm touching your shin.
-No, ma'am.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.000
Okay, it's not spinal.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.550
I think this is

20:27.790 --> 20:28.790

20:28.790 --> 20:30.500
It's cutting off the blood flow
to your leg, okay?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.090
I have to relieve
the pressure now,

20:32.090 --> 20:33.790

He invited you golfing,
didn't he?

21:44.710 --> 21:46.130

to be relaxing.

21:50.790 --> 21:52.630

21:52.630 --> 21:54.420
Yes.
He invited me to golf, but...

21:54.420 --> 21:57.550
I haven't swung a club
in quite a while,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.210

21:59.210 --> 22:01.210
Word of advice.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.340
Keep an eye on Billy.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.000

trust him with our score card?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.960

22:06.960 --> 22:08.790

a little bit slippery.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.670

-he's got the flu.
-If his airways

his windpipe to close up.

Okay, remain calm.
We're gonna make a hot compress

or a sweatshirt?
<i>-Uh, I think so.</i>

31:48.750 --> 31:50.250
-In my truck.
<i>-All right.</i>

31:50.250 --> 31:51.340

Don't worry about it.

-When do you start treatment?
-Already have.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.790
Hold on.
You're doin' chemo...

34:11.790 --> 34:14.250
-Mm-hmm.
-On the job.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.790
-What are you, Hercules?
-Ha. Hardly.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.790
Almost passed out doin' bench
presses the other day.

34:17.790 --> 34:21.130
Yeah, I have to sneak off
to puke every now and then,

34:21.130 --> 34:24.090
but I'm gettin' through it.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.500
You know what that
makes you, Owen?

34:26.500 --> 34:27.880

34:27.880 --> 34:29.130

34:37.090 --> 34:38.920
You okay?

34:38.920 --> 34:40.790
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna vomit.

34:40.790 --> 34:43.460
-Oh--
-No, no, no, no, no.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.050

I'm good.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.960

-Yeah.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.550
Definitely.

34:49.550 --> 34:50.790

34:50.790 --> 34:52.790
Hey, look at me.

34:52.790 --> 34:55.090
This is the easy part.
You've done the work.

34:55.090 --> 34:58.460
Just stay present,
listen to my voice,

34:58.460 --> 35:00.710
and I promise you,

35:00.710 --> 35:01.790
the answers'll pop
right into your head.

35:01.790 --> 35:03.170

Head held high.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.710
We got this.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.500
Say it...

35:14.500 --> 35:15.920
-We got this.
-Mm-hmm.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.880
Ma'am, you'll have to

35:19.880 --> 35:21.210
wait outside.
-What are you talking about?

35:21.210 --> 35:22.380
I have to read his exam
to him.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.500
We don't allow firefighters

35:24.500 --> 35:26.000

it's Academy policy.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.710
-But in Miami, I--
-This isn't Miami, sweetheart.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.300
Besides, he's more accustomed

35:33.790 --> 35:35.550
You know this guy?

Nobody's ever played

ALDEN: Captain Tyson and I
are old buddies,

38:09.500 --> 38:11.790
and he happened to mention
to me at the club

38:11.790 --> 38:14.500
how much he admired you
fighting through your, uh,

38:14.500 --> 38:17.170
cancer diagnosis.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.880
He did, did he?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.420
BILLY:
Yeah, sorry, bud.

38:20.420 --> 38:21.710
I didn't know

38:28.630 --> 38:29.790
Yeah.

38:29.790 --> 38:31.380
ALDEN: Okay, what you've done
in a short time

38:31.380 --> 38:33.380
with the 126
has been very impressive.

38:33.380 --> 38:36.000
Throw in everything you've been

38:36.000 --> 38:38.790
-Thank you.
-But I'm concerned.

38:38.790 --> 38:40.630
Captain Tyson has told me
about these fainting spells

38:40.630 --> 38:43.790
-and you getting sick on calls?
-OWEN: That's an exaggeration.

38:43.790 --> 38:46.130
I've been dealing with this
for months without a complaint.

38:46.130 --> 38:48.750
But it's not just your safety
that I'm concerned about.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.790
If your fitness
is in any way compromised,

38:50.790 --> 38:52.800
that puts your crew
and the public at risk.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.800
Hey, there's no shame
in takin' a break.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.460

Now I run the 121.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.710
Look at Tiger--finally
took time off to heal,

39:01.710 --> 39:04.210
came back, won the Masters.
Again.

39:04.210 --> 39:06.790
Yeah, well,
I don't need a break.

39:06.790 --> 39:09.710
Look, I'm as fit as anybody
in this department to serve.

39:09.710 --> 39:13.790
-I wanna believe that, Captain.
-I'll prove it.

39:13.790 --> 39:15.790

39:15.790 --> 39:17.500
Gotta run the CPAT.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.250

in full PPEs.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.800
You're gonna do the entire
Cadet Physical Ability test

39:21.800 --> 39:25.790

on your back?

39:28.790 --> 39:29.800
25-year-olds in peak condition
can't do that.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.750
Well, then there'll be
no doubt, will there?

39:32.750 --> 39:35.050
I guess you've earned
that chance.

39:35.050 --> 39:37.000
