19:39.646 --> 19:41.245
        Come on, Keish.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.514
         Damn, I ain't
      driving. You drive.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.448
            Come on.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.783
   You drive. You're driving.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.929
        Keisha, I don't
       know how to drive.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.766
       Um, look over your
     shoulder and back up.
        No, put it in R!

20:07.407 --> 20:08.472
          Put it in D.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.758
     [Keisha] Can you even
      see over the wheel?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.361
    You need a booster seat.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.297
             Here.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.774
      See? It's just like
      the arcade, right?

20:45.311 --> 20:46.577
    Yeah, exactly the same.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.520
         [Robbie] Shit!

21:04.364 --> 21:06.330
   See, it's not coming out.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.498
          Put it in P.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.372
           Holy crap!

21:16.743 --> 21:22.647
I need some clothes and you need
  a shower and some deodorant.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.549
What? Don't even make that face.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.285
     We're going shopping.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.620
     I need some shoes too.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.622

21:33.760 --> 21:35.293
     We got money, Robbie.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.328
         Lots of money.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.298
 Money coming out of your ass.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.738
 This ain't what I had in mind.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.442
 I'm supposed to wear someone's
 used shit that they gave away?

21:52.612 --> 21:55.646
        Smells like crusty
      old lady in here, too.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.417
       You got to take me
       shopping for real.

21:59.419 --> 22:03.421

    perfume on you when you
 walk in, the clothes are new.

         Designer shit.

22:08.795 --> 22:12.430
         Actually, some
     of this is all right.

22:14.100 --> 22:19.804
      I mean we need regular
     stuff like toothbrushes,
        toothpaste, socks.

22:20.540 --> 22:26.077
      I need necessities,
     all right? New outfit,
    cute shoes, accessories.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.411
        We need a plan.

22:27.647 --> 22:31.615
  Well, I plan on buying this.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.871
      I'm trying this on.

22:36.872 --> 22:39.656
     Maybe, we should like
     switch cars. Probably,
   you should start driving?

22:40.126 --> 22:42.927
 Oh, this is cute. Cute, right?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.463
    Probably stride tonight.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.401
       Ew! Used panties?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.503
       Who's buying this?

23:00.847 --> 23:05.583
   Oh, this. This is for you.
You got to try this on, Robbie.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.518
      No, this is too big.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.921
       Excuse me, Ma'am.
       Could you get that
      down for me please?

23:11.691 --> 23:12.790

         [Keisha] Whoa!

23:41.521 --> 23:48.559
     Yes. It's like twenty
     thousand, four hundred
  and seventy after shopping.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.830
             Whoo!

23:59.639 --> 24:00.905
     He's going to kill us.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.675
What are we going to do, Robbie?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.577
    Maybe go to California.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.446
          California?

24:08.448 --> 24:12.483
     Dawn's in L.A. making
     stacks, so she says.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.585
       That's like the same
          place, right?

24:14.587 --> 24:17.855
        Yeah, pretty much.
           Who's Dawn?

24:18.658 --> 24:22.660
      Dawn, from the club.
      Short, blonde hair?

24:23.196 --> 24:24.962
    Oh, the fat white girl.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.999
     She's a little thick.

     Wait, ain't your real
     daddy out there too?

24:37.643 --> 24:38.609
         I don't know.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.346
  That's what Martin told me.

24:42.347 --> 24:43.746
     He wanted to send your
     ass out there anyway.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.017
          He might be.

24:48.221 --> 24:49.854
 He was there three years ago.

24:52.024 --> 24:56.760
   Well, we're going to find
   him too, find your daddy.

  They don't have any motels,

       with his reading.

36:23.448 --> 36:26.583

them works for the post office.

     Oh, I'm going to give
         you some food.

36:36.562 --> 36:41.598
   You're probably starving.
And it's also good before you go
to sleep to have a little milk.

  for my cookies on this trip
   so more for us. [giggling]
