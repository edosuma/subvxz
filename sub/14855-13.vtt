00:10.713 --> 00:12.636
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

00:13.323 --> 00:15.486
<i>And this is the day that
changes everything.</i>

00:17.042 --> 00:19.608
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.634 --> 00:21.008
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.013 --> 00:23.294
Who the hell are you, people?

00:24.015 --> 00:25.732
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.417 --> 00:29.141
<i>I know all this
because I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.736 --> 00:31.304
<i>over, and over again.</i>

00:31.385 --> 00:33.994
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.169 --> 00:35.776
<i>The pieces are finally coming together.</i>

00:36.022 --> 00:37.499
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.548
- What's it about?
- Corruption at city hall.

00:39.708 --> 00:40.898
<i>Why Garza was murdered.</i>

00:40.959 --> 00:43.591
He cut a deal.
He was supposed to testify againt Booth.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.667
<i>Why I was framed.</i>

00:44.668 --> 00:46.120
Garza sent me two packages.

00:46.155 --> 00:47.917
<i>Evidence
from one of my father's old cases.</i>

00:48.078 --> 00:50.084
<i>Everyone around me
is somehow tied to this.</i>

00:50.136 --> 00:51.827
Shelten... It's been a while.

00:51.879 --> 00:53.112
You're asking me to lie.

00:53.189 --> 00:54.854
You've had four years of practice.

00:54.868 --> 00:56.283
What the hell are you doing here, D.?

00:56.284 --> 00:57.712
I need five minutes.

00:57.758 --> 00:58.780
<i>But until yesterday,</i>

00:58.832 --> 01:00.566
<i>I was missing a couple of key players.</i>

01:00.588 --> 01:03.178
They arraigned some lawyer.
His name is Barry Coldburn.

01:03.274 --> 01:05.510
Booth, Detweiler. Spivak?

01:05.566 --> 01:06.889
<i>Now, it's time to finish it.</i>

01:06.890 --> 01:07.846
Great minds, uh?

01:45.657 --> 01:46.626
I love you.

01:50.264 --> 01:51.260
I love you too.

01:55.889 --> 01:57.370
There's something I need to tell you.

01:59.167 --> 02:00.766
It's about my brother Billy.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.381
Billy was sure we'd go to jail
for what we did to Dad.

02:12.046 --> 02:13.055
Freaked out.

02:14.379 --> 02:16.249
I did the only thing
that I could think of.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.184
I called Chad.

02:26.569 --> 02:28.682
I can't let this hang over me anymore.

02:30.344 --> 02:32.677
I think I should go to the police
and tell them what I did.

02:32.752 --> 02:33.874
No, not today.

02:34.318 --> 02:37.327
It's too dangerous. Call your brother,
tell him to get out of town.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.428
These people are serious.

02:43.948 --> 02:46.393
What are you saying?
These are the same people that are...

02:46.478 --> 02:47.994
framing you for Garza's murder?

02:48.778 --> 02:51.316
I think it all revolves
around a case this judge is building.

02:51.498 --> 02:53.320
The grand jury's supposed
to convene tomorrow.

02:53.525 --> 02:56.068
And Garza was supposed to testify.
I think that's why...

02:56.147 --> 02:57.130
he was killed.

02:57.183 --> 02:59.060
But what does that have to do with us?

02:59.827 --> 03:00.796
I don't know. But...

03:00.941 --> 03:03.516
If we're gonna get through this,
we're gonna need some help.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.706
- Thanks for coming.
- Not a problem.

03:08.176 --> 03:09.336
Pleasant surprise.

03:10.134 --> 03:11.103
Everything alright?

03:14.630 --> 03:16.006
Cream, two sugars, right?

03:19.980 --> 03:22.536
Real nice of you using Rita
to embush me.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.004
She told me everything.

03:24.607 --> 03:26.088
About Billy. Her father.

03:27.045 --> 03:29.162
How you helped them out with the body.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.699
I'm sorry, Chad. I...

03:31.118 --> 03:33.320
I just... I couldn't lie to him anymore.

03:33.871 --> 03:35.387
I would have done the same thing.

03:35.523 --> 03:36.487
Please...

03:38.197 --> 03:39.337
Just hear him out.

03:43.007 --> 03:46.349
- What do you want from me, Hopper?
- Those guys you dealt with back then.

03:46.453 --> 03:47.908
The same guys are messing with me now.

03:48.092 --> 03:50.052
Something really big is about to happen.

03:50.182 --> 03:51.821
And it deals with politicians...

03:51.873 --> 03:52.869
gangs...

03:53.197 --> 03:54.194
crooked cops...

03:55.347 --> 03:57.234
Today's the day
I'm gonna bring it all down.

03:58.794 --> 03:59.791
I'm asking,

04:00.401 --> 04:01.411
are you in?

04:04.438 --> 04:05.447
I'm listening.

04:07.151 --> 04:09.302
There's a case going
before the grand jury tomorrow,

04:09.303 --> 04:11.175
investigating corruption in city hall.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.135
But there's a Robbery/Homicide Detective
named Spivak. You know him?

04:16.915 --> 04:18.462
A real pain in the ass. What about him?

04:18.553 --> 04:20.392
Subpoenas are being issued in this case.

04:20.523 --> 04:21.860
His name is on the list.

04:22.541 --> 04:23.774
Wanna be part of this?

04:24.233 --> 04:25.281
Look into Spivak.

04:26.905 --> 04:29.067
What makes you think I'll help <i>you</i>
of all people?

04:29.946 --> 04:32.502
The sniper was gonna shoot you,
but I pushed you out of the way.

04:32.816 --> 04:35.726
<i>- Why did you do it?
- We were friends once. Partners.</i>

04:36.397 --> 04:38.220
I know we got our issues, but...

04:39.557 --> 04:42.155
at the end of the day,
I think you're a good cop.

04:43.357 --> 04:44.354
A good man.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.629
I think we should tell him about Garza.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.632
The A.D.A. that got killed last night?

04:51.724 --> 04:53.393
Brett's being framed for his murder.

04:57.076 --> 04:58.352
OK, I'm on my way.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.059
I'd love to explain, but I gotta go.

05:02.237 --> 05:04.801
You can't just say you're wanted
for killing a public official

05:04.802 --> 05:05.798
and expect to walk away.

05:05.799 --> 05:07.361
I forgot to make this phone call.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.214
- No, I can't let you go.
- Get out of my way.

05:09.307 --> 05:11.587
You talked a good game
about corruption and dirty cops,

05:11.588 --> 05:13.889
but you failed to mention
that you're wanted for murder.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.218
- You don't understand.
- I have to do this.

05:16.219 --> 05:17.742
Let's go down to the station.

05:19.963 --> 05:22.206
Easy. If you're innocent,
you got nothing to worry about.

05:22.207 --> 05:23.203
Margo, wait.

05:24.729 --> 05:25.725
Don't move.

05:35.701 --> 05:36.754
+

05:37.390 --> 05:38.373
Give it up, pal.

05:38.783 --> 05:40.644
- No place left to run.
- Right.

05:43.012 --> 05:44.693
- Freeze!
- Margo, don't get in the car.

05:44.756 --> 05:45.960
OK, give me twenty minutes.

05:46.357 --> 05:47.484
Stop the bus!

05:55.735 --> 05:56.844
I'm a police officer.

05:56.881 --> 05:58.377
Yeah! But what the hell, are you crazy?

05:58.378 --> 06:00.160
Get out of the bus,
you'll have a stroke.

06:00.239 --> 06:02.210
Pal, I don't know
what the hell you are thinking.

06:02.211 --> 06:04.767
This bus is about to crash,
he's gonna have a stroke any second.

06:04.775 --> 06:06.233
- What did you say?
- This is insane!

06:06.234 --> 06:08.746
- I gotta hit you outta here.
- Please, just calm down.

06:10.622 --> 06:12.065
Rita, call 911, now!

06:12.246 --> 06:13.797
- Easy.
- We got him.

06:13.798 --> 06:15.422
I think he's having a stroke!

06:15.423 --> 06:16.408
Hold on, sir.

06:16.681 --> 06:17.651
You gotta stand up.

06:20.587 --> 06:21.550
What are you doing?

06:21.604 --> 06:23.746
Do some digging,
you'll find Spivak's the inside man.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.114
Promise me you'll go to the hospital
and stay there.

06:28.239 --> 06:29.338
I need to know you're safe.

06:29.339 --> 06:30.461
- I can't.
- Promise me.

06:30.563 --> 06:31.958
Don't leave until I say.

06:32.256 --> 06:33.502
- All right?
- I promise.

06:34.997 --> 06:35.974
Alright.

06:56.481 --> 06:57.464
May I help you?

06:57.767 --> 06:59.720
Yes, Detective Brett Hopper. LAPD.

06:59.773 --> 07:01.397
I'm looking for Margo Clarke.

07:01.897 --> 07:02.880
She stepped away.

07:04.142 --> 07:05.414
Are you Judge Nitzberg?

07:06.113 --> 07:07.096
Yes, why?

07:07.948 --> 07:10.582
I'm here
about the grand jury hearing tomorrow.

07:11.886 --> 07:15.166
Damien Ortiz,
he's my confidential informant.

07:15.658 --> 07:17.899
And I know
that he was testifying for you.

07:18.110 --> 07:19.093
So was Garza.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.162
Who sent you, Booth?

07:23.706 --> 07:25.437
No, sir. We're on the same side.

07:27.829 --> 07:29.730
Booth framed me for Garza's murder.

07:30.627 --> 07:34.205
You can tell Booth and his cronies
I will not be intimidated.

07:34.467 --> 07:38.294
This grand jury investigation
will proceed with or without Garza.

07:38.295 --> 07:39.264
That's good.

07:39.739 --> 07:41.466
See, that's why I'm here. Sir,

07:42.618 --> 07:44.257
Garza sent me two packages.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.668
Evidence linked to a homicide
that my father worked.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.702
Evidence that leads right back to Booth.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.061
- Garza sent you evidence?
- Yes, sir.

07:52.193 --> 07:54.501
In case something would happen to him,
I guess I was his...

07:54.553 --> 07:55.693
insurance policy.

07:56.478 --> 07:57.671
And somebody found out.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.302
Now, did anybody else know
that he was gonna testify...

08:00.303 --> 08:01.292
Detective.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.344
I can't risk discussing the details.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.748
Your Honor, I just need to know
if I'm on the right track.

08:08.273 --> 08:09.256
Who else knew?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.196
Technically...

08:16.508 --> 08:17.491
No one.

08:17.639 --> 08:19.356
The warrant was sealed, but...

08:20.209 --> 08:21.192
But what?

08:21.398 --> 08:23.966
Last night, he called
and said he was having second thoughts.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.434
- Garza called you last night?
- He was scared,

08:26.435 --> 08:29.782
he said that his wife kept telling him
how dangerous these people are.

08:30.027 --> 08:32.443
So Mrs. Garza was trying
to talk him out of testifying.

08:32.581 --> 08:35.296
- She's in on this. With Booth.
- What?

08:35.333 --> 08:37.929
She claimed
that she saw me murder her husband.

08:38.044 --> 08:39.897
She's the key witness against me.

08:39.972 --> 08:40.955
Julissa?

08:41.453 --> 08:42.712
- Why?
- I don't know but if...

08:42.748 --> 08:44.836
if Garza told her about the packages,

08:44.989 --> 08:46.072
and she told Booth...

08:46.756 --> 08:47.975
She's the connection.

08:49.549 --> 08:50.638
She betrayed her husband.

08:50.639 --> 08:52.198
That's how Booth found out about me.

08:52.289 --> 08:53.862
That's why I'm being framed.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.514
Now, this grand jury...

08:56.515 --> 08:59.047
Do you have enough
to bring down Booth without Garza?

08:59.361 --> 09:02.063
I don't know.
We've had to postpone the hearing.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.480
But the other presiding judges and I
are going to

09:04.539 --> 09:05.922
need to see if we can continue.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.914
- When's the meeting?
- It hasn't been set yet.

09:08.319 --> 09:10.142
Let's say I can break Mrs. Garza.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.959
Is she just as valuable to you
as her husband?

09:13.264 --> 09:15.336
- You think you can do that?
- Yes.

09:15.665 --> 09:16.988
But I need a favor from you.

09:27.607 --> 09:28.599
I surrender.

09:32.782 --> 09:33.197
+

09:36.930 --> 09:38.257
- Jenny.
- Brett.

09:39.974 --> 09:41.141
Everything's gonna be OK.

09:41.577 --> 09:43.407
- Can you give us a sec?
- Yeah.

09:43.931 --> 09:44.903
Make it fast.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.477
Everything is in here,
just like you wanted.

09:48.764 --> 09:49.725
All this...

09:50.045 --> 09:51.533
- Is it about Dad? Why--
- Yes.

09:53.195 --> 09:56.526
I know it's been eating you up inside
for a long time.

09:57.757 --> 09:58.819
Why he killed himself.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.149
But you need to realize

10:02.516 --> 10:03.590
you're not Dad.

10:05.596 --> 10:06.815
Hopper, we gotta move.

10:09.426 --> 10:10.422
Thanks, sister.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.710
Look, I'm only doing this
because Judge Nitzberg called

10:14.711 --> 10:16.845
- and vouched for you.
- You're doing the right thing.

10:17.887 --> 10:18.870
I'd better be.

10:19.645 --> 10:22.489
You screw this up and I'm running
a desk for the next ten years.

10:22.542 --> 10:25.124
- Where is she?
- Inside, with your partner.

10:25.314 --> 10:27.254
- You've got ten minutes.
- Alright.

10:28.135 --> 10:29.365
- I'll wait for you.
- Alright.

10:34.419 --> 10:35.756
Oh God. It's him.

10:36.214 --> 10:37.766
That's the man that killed my husband!

10:37.767 --> 10:39.264
Be quiet. Save your breath.

10:40.177 --> 10:41.500
I know you're in on it.

10:41.959 --> 10:43.611
Framing me for your husband's murder.

10:43.834 --> 10:44.856
Why is he here?

10:45.092 --> 10:46.285
This man is a killer.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.028
He's innocent till proven guilty.

10:48.304 --> 10:49.313
Why did you do it?

10:50.332 --> 10:51.630
Did Booth have something on you?

10:51.761 --> 10:52.862
This is ridiculous.

10:53.597 --> 10:56.074
They found a gun in his apartment.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.136
She's got a point.

10:57.175 --> 10:58.597
Give me a favor, go down to SID,

10:58.598 --> 11:01.061
grab hold of ballistics and prints
for the murder weapon.

11:01.376 --> 11:02.647
Someone's gonna fake the results.

11:03.565 --> 11:05.216
- You sure about all this?
- I'm sure.

11:12.725 --> 11:14.488
<i>Now we're gonna start
at the very beginning.</i>

11:18.563 --> 11:20.504
Don't... touch the bubble head.

11:41.021 --> 11:44.044
The detective who just left...
Spivak. What was he doing down here?

11:51.542 --> 11:52.814
It's a simple question.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.383
Was the gun in my right hand
or in my left?

11:55.580 --> 11:57.258
- I'm not...
- Right or left?

11:57.494 --> 11:59.922
You said I was standing
over your husband's body with the gun.

11:59.923 --> 12:01.945
- Which hand was it in?
- I demand to see a lawyer.

12:01.946 --> 12:03.465
Did I leave out the back or the front?

12:03.466 --> 12:05.798
- I don't know.
- You don't know because I wasn't there!

12:07.938 --> 12:09.942
Did you even know
what your husband had on Booth?

12:11.542 --> 12:12.525
I do.

12:12.787 --> 12:13.796
He sent it to me.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.291
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:18.257 --> 12:19.712
That's Isabella Contreras.

12:20.524 --> 12:21.678
Booth had her killed.

12:22.464 --> 12:23.460
Killed.

12:24.299 --> 12:25.846
One to the head, two to the chest.

12:27.699 --> 12:28.695
Sound familiar?

12:29.154 --> 12:30.150
<i>That's his M.O.</i>

12:30.661 --> 12:31.932
What the hell is this?

12:38.731 --> 12:40.985
Booth didn't tell you about Isabella,
did he?

12:41.955 --> 12:44.511
I've known Tobias for 25 years.

12:45.114 --> 12:46.858
<i>He's an honorable man.</i>

12:46.944 --> 12:47.953
<i>How dare you?</i>

12:49.035 --> 12:51.545
You let a murder suspect into a room
with our only eye witness?

12:51.546 --> 12:53.899
I got a call from a presiding judge
who vouched for Hopper.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.312
- What judge?
- Nitzberg.

12:56.623 --> 12:59.566
See, the sad thing about this
is that when a woman's pregnant,

13:00.204 --> 13:02.079
they do a separate autopsy...

13:02.591 --> 13:03.560
on the fetus.

13:05.590 --> 13:07.666
See, that's the man
that you're trying to protect.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.540
- It's not possible.
- He got a girl pregnant,

13:09.541 --> 13:11.619
and then killed her
to save his own career.

13:11.794 --> 13:13.038
Tobias would never...

13:16.578 --> 13:17.574
Tobias...

13:25.285 --> 13:26.386
I had it all wrong.

13:26.662 --> 13:28.503
Here I thought
he was blackmailing you...

13:30.416 --> 13:31.478
That's not what happened.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.607
You were sleeping with him.

13:41.051 --> 13:42.689
You realize what you've done?

13:42.833 --> 13:44.524
Mrs. Garza's testimony is tainted,

13:44.525 --> 13:46.892
we'll be lucky if anything she says
is admissible in court.

13:49.009 --> 13:50.830
Your husband would tell you everything.

13:51.892 --> 13:53.942
But he didn't know
that you were rolling over

13:53.943 --> 13:55.923
and whispering those same secrets

13:56.486 --> 13:57.640
into Booth's ear.

13:57.732 --> 14:00.019
- You have no right.
- You basically let the killer in,

14:00.020 --> 14:02.431
let the killer put a bullet
in your husband's head.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.144
- I don't have to hear this from you.
- Garza flipped on Booth,

14:05.510 --> 14:07.438
finally listened to his conscience,

14:07.536 --> 14:09.555
finally found the strength to say no.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.137
Alberto was weak!

14:11.312 --> 14:12.661
He got what he deserved!

14:15.603 --> 14:16.704
<i>You have no idea...</i>

14:17.491 --> 14:18.618
<i>what I sacrificed...</i>

14:18.670 --> 14:20.807
Did she just say what I think she did?

14:22.072 --> 14:23.527
I put in too much time,

14:24.211 --> 14:26.727
too many years to let it all die.

14:27.514 --> 14:30.137
Because Alberto lacked the strength

14:30.210 --> 14:32.366
to do whatever it takes.

14:34.110 --> 14:36.050
He was nothing without me.

14:39.668 --> 14:40.664
Hopper didn't do it.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.108
- <i>Are you happy now?</i>
- We gotta get Booth down here, now.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.227
Yeah, we do, make the call.

15:03.679 --> 15:04.676
I...

15:05.238 --> 15:06.733
just received the word.

15:08.437 --> 15:09.446
I know.

15:10.731 --> 15:12.186
What do you want me to do?

15:14.812 --> 15:15.991
Cooperate fully.

15:16.922 --> 15:19.071
Let them do their song and dance.

15:19.412 --> 15:20.841
I'll get you out of there in an hour.

15:20.967 --> 15:24.003
I mean about Julissa Garza,
she knows enough to implicate me.

15:24.244 --> 15:25.562
I'll handle Julissa.

15:26.716 --> 15:28.551
But we have a more pressing problem.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.185
Detective Hopper.

15:31.684 --> 15:34.069
- I'll talk to Detweiler.
- Talk to everyone.

15:35.379 --> 15:37.024
Detweiler, Nick Vukovic,

15:37.352 --> 15:39.043
Torrez and all his people.

15:39.363 --> 15:40.334
I understand.

15:41.985 --> 15:44.462
Hopper will be dead
before the day is over.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.572
The important thing...

15:48.040 --> 15:51.160
is that nothing derails tomorrow.

15:57.265 --> 16:01.301
We have to send a clear message
as to who exactly runs this city.

16:09.243 --> 16:11.221
I understand completely.
Yeah.

16:11.589 --> 16:13.372
I'll be sure to pass that along.

16:14.462 --> 16:15.746
No. Thank <i>you</i>, sir.

16:21.121 --> 16:22.300
Damn shame.

16:22.932 --> 16:24.768
Someone you know betrays you.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.615
Makes you wonder
who you gotta really trust.*gotta/can ?

16:30.122 --> 16:31.642
What are you talking about?

16:31.826 --> 16:32.822
I just got word:

16:34.032 --> 16:36.562
Hopper's the one who gave you up
at the safe house.

16:38.528 --> 16:39.498
Hop?

16:40.284 --> 16:41.281
You sure?

16:41.373 --> 16:42.566
I wish I wasn't.

16:45.281 --> 16:46.893
Kills me
to be the one who tell you, kid.

16:49.496 --> 16:50.661
+

16:54.052 --> 16:55.022
Thanks.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.555
Good news and bad news.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.816
Found the body in the bathtub
over your apartment, so that checks out.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.968
But there was no one at that address
on Via Ombra.

17:03.004 --> 17:03.974
What?

17:04.053 --> 17:05.704
They must have moved Margo
somewhere else.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.222
They said she had to set up a meeting
for tomorrow.

17:08.223 --> 17:09.230
A group of judges.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.337
If this is as big as you're claiming,

17:12.755 --> 17:14.170
it could lead to dozens of arrests.

17:14.171 --> 17:17.368
Prison officials, city councilmen,
federal prosecutors, ex-cops.

17:17.473 --> 17:18.614
Not just ex-cops.

17:20.212 --> 17:21.275
Active duty too.

17:23.086 --> 17:24.056
What do you got?

17:24.698 --> 17:25.930
I can't prove anything yet.

17:27.752 --> 17:30.767
I'm gonna see if we got anything
on this... Konrad Detweiler.

17:30.833 --> 17:31.807
Cool.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.012
That's a hell of a story, Hopper.

17:37.470 --> 17:38.733
Everybody out to get at you.

17:39.896 --> 17:41.141
You are to get me too ?

17:41.279 --> 17:42.288
Me?

17:42.616 --> 17:44.123
No, I'm just doing my job!

17:44.686 --> 17:46.907
Does that include
planting a weapon at my place

17:46.908 --> 17:48.792
doctoring ballistics
and faking finger prints?

17:50.221 --> 17:51.768
Nobody's here, it's just you and me.

17:51.860 --> 17:52.829
Admit it.

17:53.445 --> 17:55.270
The apple
doesn't fall far from the tree,

17:55.271 --> 17:56.618
you're just like your old man.

17:56.644 --> 17:58.810
- The ego, the sheer eye dance...
- Watch your mouth!

17:58.811 --> 17:59.946
My father was a good cop.

18:00.034 --> 18:01.060
He was a dirty cop.

18:02.161 --> 18:04.298
And he dragged down
a lot of good people with him.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.756
Who do you think you're playing,
Spivak, you're not sleek.

18:07.805 --> 18:09.220
I know about the grand jury.

18:10.885 --> 18:11.855
The subpoena.

18:12.776 --> 18:15.475
My father did what he had to do
to protect his family.

18:15.502 --> 18:16.472
What's your excuse?

18:16.473 --> 18:19.481
You don't know a damn thing, Hopper.
Nick Vukovic is my ex-partner.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.296
- Nick?
- That's right.

18:21.348 --> 18:23.394
And your dad turned him
into the traitor he is today.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.358
- Get the facts straight. It's the--
- That's a lot of crap, Hopper!

18:26.974 --> 18:28.599
Talked to my guys in county.

18:29.845 --> 18:30.893
You wanna see this.

18:31.496 --> 18:33.282
Jackets on Fencik and Buchalter.

18:34.068 --> 18:36.034
Ex-deputies, just like Hopper said.

18:39.523 --> 18:41.509
You're gonna move on that, or what?

18:48.885 --> 18:50.354
Got a present for you too.

18:51.402 --> 18:53.631
SID found your finger prints
on the Garza murder weapon,

18:53.632 --> 18:55.759
- just like you said.
- Who else has seen this report?

18:55.884 --> 18:56.855
No one.

18:57.757 --> 18:59.965
It was on top of Rednazki's inbox,
still sealed.

19:00.463 --> 19:01.433
You stole it?

19:02.390 --> 19:03.354
Borrowed it.

19:03.648 --> 19:05.666
Either way,
it shouldn't have been there.

19:05.718 --> 19:06.795
Any idea who gave it to us?

19:06.820 --> 19:08.908
I have a pretty good guess.
What's up with the widow?

19:08.916 --> 19:11.609
Mrs. G.? She lawyered up already,
she's on her way home.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.602
Who's the suitor?

19:12.706 --> 19:14.216
The best defense guy in the city.

19:14.526 --> 19:16.376
- Barry Coldburn.
- Yeah, how do you know?

19:16.495 --> 19:17.620
That just makes sense.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.886
- Catch up with me later.
- All right.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.123
- Hello?
- <i>Detective Hopper,</i>

19:22.124 --> 19:23.309
this is Judge Nitzberg.

19:23.419 --> 19:24.725
Your Honor, is everything OK?

19:24.742 --> 19:25.702
<i>Well, I'm not sure.</i>

19:25.891 --> 19:28.493
Margo never came back from lunch,
but she left me a voice mail.

19:28.619 --> 19:30.119
You never saw her after I left?

19:30.187 --> 19:33.510
No, but she called to set a meeting
for me with the other presiding judges.

19:33.518 --> 19:35.379
- <i>Is this about the grand jury?</i>
- Yes.

19:35.497 --> 19:37.581
They grabbed me at work. Two of them.

19:37.582 --> 19:39.506
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

19:39.727 --> 19:41.083
At the courthouse.

19:41.117 --> 19:42.659
- When's the meeting?
- <i>Nine o'clock.</i>

19:42.660 --> 19:45.032
- Nine o'clock tonight?
- <i>No, tomorrow morning.</i>

19:45.150 --> 19:46.117
Tomorrow.

19:49.524 --> 19:51.257
It's a long way away. I gotta go.

19:54.938 --> 19:56.040
I'll take him up, fellows.

19:56.345 --> 19:57.871
Sorry, elevator's full.

19:58.006 --> 19:59.480
Lose the entourage.

20:16.246 --> 20:17.501
I'm sorry, have we met?

20:17.671 --> 20:20.413
I don't know what you got planned,
but it's over.

20:22.132 --> 20:23.725
Yeah, we broke Mrs. Garza.

20:24.421 --> 20:26.438
You're that detective. Right?

20:27.609 --> 20:29.998
You forgot to tell her
about Isabella Contreras.

20:31.251 --> 20:32.455
How you killed the young woman.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.421
And her unborn child.

20:35.366 --> 20:37.807
<i>Your</i> unborn child.

20:38.451 --> 20:39.688
You think this is the first time

20:39.689 --> 20:42.213
I've been threatened by a detective
named Hopper?

20:42.467 --> 20:45.248
Your father made threats too,
and look how that ended.

20:45.249 --> 20:46.519
You don't talk about him.

20:46.756 --> 20:47.716
Suit yourself.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.413
But you two have a lot more in common
than you might think.

20:54.111 --> 20:56.061
I have bad news for you, Detective.

20:57.247 --> 20:59.145
I'll be out of here in an hour
and you'll end up

20:59.146 --> 21:01.968
with a bullet in your head,
just like your old man.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.578
And just like him,

21:07.360 --> 21:08.716
you'll never see it coming.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.190
Didn't you hear me from the lobby?

21:31.058 --> 21:32.067
What's wrong?

21:35.798 --> 21:37.611
I need you to tell me everything

21:39.036 --> 21:41.103
that you remember about Dad's death.

21:42.070 --> 21:43.256
- Why?
- I know it's hard,

21:43.257 --> 21:44.798
it's just... It's really important.

21:45.251 --> 21:47.150
Tell me exactly what you saw
when you found him.

21:50.404 --> 21:51.421
It was a mess.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.862
I walked in,

21:56.138 --> 21:57.098
and...

21:57.508 --> 21:58.541
I saw his body.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.033
I tried calling Mom, tried calling you.

22:02.940 --> 22:04.193
And then I got hold of Nick.

22:04.888 --> 22:05.854
What did he say?

22:06.139 --> 22:07.157
He was shocked.

22:08.275 --> 22:10.479
But he came right away.
He called the police.

22:11.003 --> 22:12.478
He handled everything.

22:12.953 --> 22:14.597
He really saved me, that day.

22:14.665 --> 22:16.309
Maybe you should talk to him.

22:16.847 --> 22:19.270
Why are you asking me about this now?

22:20.813 --> 22:22.338
I don't think dad killed himself.

22:24.297 --> 22:25.669
I think he was murdered.

22:27.474 --> 22:28.440
What?

22:28.812 --> 22:30.643
- Who?
- Wait, let me call Nick.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.442
Nick, it's Hopper. Where are you?

22:41.980 --> 22:43.268
- Yeah?
- Hi, Hopper.

22:44.455 --> 22:45.415
What do you want?

22:45.824 --> 22:48.789
<i>Just heard the good news, word is
you've been cleared of the Garza mess.</i>

22:49.622 --> 22:52.215
Yeah, thanks. Listen man,
I got to meet somebody, so...

22:52.216 --> 22:54.238
Gotta hand it to you,
I thought they had you cold.

22:54.301 --> 22:56.566
<i>Well, with your prints
all over the murder weapon....</i>

22:58.410 --> 23:00.766
- Wait, what did you just say?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

23:01.020 --> 23:03.104
Just trying to figure how the killer
got your prints

23:03.167 --> 23:04.290
on the gun that hit Garza.

23:04.291 --> 23:05.410
Wait. How did...

23:06.529 --> 23:08.342
Heard you've been doing
a lot of talking, Hop.

23:08.717 --> 23:10.531
- Tell me about it.
- Where is Nick?

23:10.666 --> 23:12.124
I'm gonna need some answers first.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.122
+

23:15.209 --> 23:16.751
<i>Do you believe in deja vu?</i>

23:17.803 --> 23:19.515
<i>Can't leave today... Over and over...</i>

23:19.516 --> 23:22.837
<i>I'm reminded of another time,
another place,</i>

23:22.905 --> 23:24.431
<i>and a different Detective Hopper.</i>

23:24.432 --> 23:25.804
<i>Dad shot himself.</i>

23:25.805 --> 23:27.313
<i>Where did you drag my father into?</i>

23:27.314 --> 23:28.395
<i>He came to me!</i>

23:28.399 --> 23:30.068
<i>You'll end up
with a bullet in your head,</i>

23:30.085 --> 23:31.661
<i>just like your old man.</i>

23:32.831 --> 23:34.627
<i>And just like him,</i>

23:36.356 --> 23:37.712
<i>you'll never see it coming.</i>

24:03.435 --> 24:05.506
<i>Brett. Oh my God!
We've been trying to reach you.</i>

24:05.675 --> 24:07.616
Yeah, baby, I'm sorry, I'm...

24:08.348 --> 24:09.692
I'm OK.

24:09.725 --> 24:10.687
<i>I was so worried.<i></i></i>

24:10.734 --> 24:12.653
<i>I thought after everything
that happened...</i>

24:12.778 --> 24:15.087
No, I'm all right. You just hold tight.

24:15.168 --> 24:17.442
<i>This morning, when you weren't here,
I called the station.</i>

24:18.851 --> 24:20.091
Wait, hold on, What d'you...

24:20.237 --> 24:21.207
What did you just say?

24:21.232 --> 24:22.609
<i>I said I called the station.</i>

24:22.886 --> 24:24.773
No, before that. Before that.

24:25.836 --> 24:27.177
Did you say this morning?

24:27.335 --> 24:29.078
<i>Yeah. Brett, what's going on?</i>

24:29.250 --> 24:30.666
<i>You sound really strange.</i>

24:33.344 --> 24:35.392
- Rita, what time is it?
- <i>What? I don't know.</i>

24:35.554 --> 24:36.587
What time is it?

24:39.888 --> 24:40.858
<i>Ten after seven.</i>

24:51.083 --> 24:52.149
It's tomorrow.

24:55.336 --> 24:56.402
It's tomorrow.

24:58.237 --> 24:58.751
+

25:02.835 --> 25:04.454
I don't understand it, how...

25:05.312 --> 25:06.812
it happened. I don't know...

25:06.883 --> 25:08.288
What do you mean? What happened?

25:08.933 --> 25:10.112
No. All this stuff...

25:10.340 --> 25:12.869
All this stuff happened yesterday,
but it's like it's finally...

25:12.957 --> 25:14.786
The city's about
to go up in flames, Hop.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.216
You have no idea how big this is,
do you?

25:17.335 --> 25:18.475
They grabbed me at work.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.022
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

25:20.117 --> 25:21.724
- When's the meeting?
- Tomorrow morning.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.053
Tomorrow...

25:23.851 --> 25:25.708
It's a long way away.

25:25.709 --> 25:27.352
It's like yesterday's thing
was a set-up.

25:27.353 --> 25:28.715
Yesterday was a set up until...

25:28.911 --> 25:30.277
Baby, I get out of here, all right?

25:30.330 --> 25:32.716
Wait. Where are you?
Chad's been asking for you.

25:34.814 --> 25:35.968
- When?
- This morning.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.335
He's on his way over right now.

25:41.672 --> 25:43.468
I trust no one, so are you.

25:44.391 --> 25:45.743
No, but we have a problem.

25:46.741 --> 25:48.196
Hopper knows about Rita's Dad.

25:48.309 --> 25:50.779
- And how did that happen?
- Does it matter?

25:52.464 --> 25:53.685
I've given you what you wanted.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.226
You need to take care of them.

25:56.393 --> 25:58.022
She won't say anything,
it's Hopper we...

25:58.023 --> 26:01.260
You need to take care of them.

26:03.182 --> 26:04.151
Not going there.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.624
Yes. Yes, we are.

26:06.533 --> 26:08.301
A reckoning has come today, Sergeant.

26:08.302 --> 26:10.107
Our slates are being wiped clean.

26:12.146 --> 26:13.493
I'll kill you right now.

26:13.679 --> 26:14.741
She'd still die.

26:16.322 --> 26:18.511
I'm afraid you have a decision to make.

26:25.638 --> 26:27.809
<i>Hi. You reached
the offices
of Alan Nitzberg.</i>

26:27.844 --> 26:29.985
<i>Neither his Honou
nor his assistant, Margo...</i>

26:30.588 --> 26:32.998
My fellow Justices of the Court,

26:33.352 --> 26:35.787
our legal system is under attack, today.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.170
The death of Alberto Garza

26:40.838 --> 26:42.242
was just a warning shot.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.359
It was a sign that said:

26:45.451 --> 26:47.037
"No one is safe."

26:49.086 --> 26:50.473
It was a sign that said:

26:50.552 --> 26:51.875
"We run the System,

26:52.046 --> 26:54.785
"we will intimidate you,
we will disgrace you,

26:56.010 --> 26:58.337
"we will find your darkest secrets."

26:59.680 --> 27:00.744
These men,

27:01.375 --> 27:03.341
led by councilman Tobias Booth,

27:04.040 --> 27:05.881
try to tell <i>me</i>
how the System is running,

27:05.882 --> 27:07.493
that I'd better get on board.

27:08.309 --> 27:09.621
I told the councilman

27:09.712 --> 27:12.017
his version of justice isn't mine.

27:12.148 --> 27:13.381
Isn't ours.

27:17.276 --> 27:18.790
This isn't about justice.

27:19.345 --> 27:22.320
It's about a corrupt few
controling the many.

27:25.892 --> 27:27.773
This is about power.

27:29.820 --> 27:30.816
My friends,

27:31.788 --> 27:34.725
<i>this</i> is where we draw the line,

27:35.646 --> 27:37.454
and make our last stand.

27:39.154 --> 27:40.176
We're in position.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.032
Now.

27:46.372 --> 27:47.341
It's all yours.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.120
Make it ugly.

28:22.639 --> 28:23.626
You OK?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.240
Yeah. I'm fine.

28:29.967 --> 28:33.314
Look, Rita. This is gonna sound crazy,
but you're in danger.

28:34.967 --> 28:37.222
We need to leave.
We need to get out of town right now.

28:37.404 --> 28:38.387
What?

28:38.439 --> 28:40.261
Those people that helped us out
with your dad,

28:40.275 --> 28:41.388
they're gonna come after us.

28:42.149 --> 28:44.089
They made unacceptable demands.

28:44.270 --> 28:45.524
How do you know that?

28:45.561 --> 28:46.720
Because they told me.

28:46.837 --> 28:49.072
I tried to talk them out of it.
I did something for them.

28:49.136 --> 28:51.102
Look, I'm just trying
to take care of you, here.

28:54.378 --> 28:55.554
Don't stop on my account.

28:57.301 --> 28:59.368
No, for real.
I can't wait to hear the rest.

29:00.860 --> 29:01.433
+

29:01.776 --> 29:03.043
So, it wasn't Spivak.

29:04.078 --> 29:05.044
It was you.

29:08.152 --> 29:10.084
You switched the ballistics
and the prints.

29:11.428 --> 29:12.494
What are you talking about?

29:12.495 --> 29:15.569
Andrea got to the results
before anybody else saw them at SID.

29:15.711 --> 29:19.038
So the only person that would have known
that those were my prints on the gun...

29:19.811 --> 29:21.679
was the person who planted the report.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.578
Is that true, Chad?

29:23.831 --> 29:25.633
I understand what you did
with Rita's father,

29:25.716 --> 29:27.129
so they threatened you with that.

29:27.581 --> 29:30.333
But something tells me
that's not why you set me up.

29:30.350 --> 29:31.681
- Brett, don't...
- Rita, please.

29:33.041 --> 29:34.688
I think you did it 'cause you wanted to.

29:35.313 --> 29:38.707
I think you set me up because Rita
is with me and not with you.

29:39.688 --> 29:41.086
You never deserved her.

29:41.184 --> 29:42.597
You still don't.

29:43.966 --> 29:46.637
I don't know what you see
in this back stabbing son of a bitch.

29:46.638 --> 29:48.191
He stole you away from me.

29:48.413 --> 29:49.384
Chad...

29:49.961 --> 29:51.565
He didn't steel me.

29:52.710 --> 29:53.879
You lost me.

29:56.496 --> 29:57.517
Don't say that.

29:57.534 --> 29:58.834
Did you hear what she said?

30:00.353 --> 30:01.501
You lost her.

30:01.831 --> 30:03.065
It's on you, Chad.

30:05.008 --> 30:06.209
And always has been.

30:27.625 --> 30:28.819
Oh, my God!

30:30.436 --> 30:31.408
Stop it!

30:47.080 --> 30:48.084
It's over.

32:41.597 --> 32:42.791
Barry Coldburn.

32:43.655 --> 32:44.824
Sorry, have we met?

32:44.923 --> 32:46.677
Brett Hopper. I think you heard of me.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.421
You were that cop.

32:51.124 --> 32:53.559
The one who was accused
of killing Garza.

32:53.927 --> 32:55.246
What can I do for you?

32:55.461 --> 32:56.728
I know what you did.

32:57.303 --> 32:58.776
You're not gonna get away with it.

32:58.858 --> 33:00.269
Putting a hand on the judges,

33:00.587 --> 33:01.569
killing Garza,

33:02.131 --> 33:03.093
framing me...

33:03.999 --> 33:06.834
Those are some pretty outlandish
charges, detective.

33:07.076 --> 33:10.568
Do you have even a shred of evidence
to support them?

33:10.569 --> 33:11.540
Not yet.

33:11.951 --> 33:14.355
But it's no coincidence
your name keeps popping up.

33:14.544 --> 33:16.619
The Santyana Club,
your connection to Booth...

33:16.701 --> 33:17.804
Mrs. Garza...

33:17.930 --> 33:20.143
You even defended my girlfriend
four years ago.

33:20.341 --> 33:21.312
Really?

33:21.560 --> 33:23.679
- How did I do?
- You made it go away,

33:24.243 --> 33:26.485
just like you make
all your problems go away...

33:26.914 --> 33:28.000
until this time.

33:28.856 --> 33:29.991
Something went wrong.

33:31.029 --> 33:32.404
Judge Nitzberg.

33:42.182 --> 33:43.879
Hypothetical situation:

33:44.575 --> 33:47.327
Let's say you're the top cop
in the department.

33:47.754 --> 33:51.145
Under your regime, crime is down,
streets are safer,

33:51.170 --> 33:53.014
and bad guys get put away.

33:53.887 --> 33:56.110
How hard would you fight
to keep it that way?

33:56.851 --> 33:58.251
If it were you, Hopper,

33:58.448 --> 33:59.930
if this was your city,

34:00.567 --> 34:02.131
would you let other men,

34:02.871 --> 34:04.386
<i>lesser</i> men,

34:04.435 --> 34:06.609
dictate how justice's
supposed to be carried out?

34:07.341 --> 34:10.849
Would you let them take apart a system
that's been in place for decades?

34:11.196 --> 34:12.809
A system that works?

34:13.228 --> 34:14.496
That you built?

34:14.940 --> 34:17.690
Would you let one man ruin all that?

34:17.804 --> 34:20.983
You brought this whole thing down
because one judge said no to you?

34:21.098 --> 34:22.069
Please...

34:22.514 --> 34:25.550
You don't care about Nitzberg
or Garza or any of this.

34:25.882 --> 34:27.940
Why don't you ask me the question
you came to ask?

34:27.991 --> 34:29.275
What question is that?

34:29.324 --> 34:31.076
You wanna know what happened
to you father.

34:31.077 --> 34:32.684
I know what happened to my father.

34:32.724 --> 34:33.696
He was murdered.

34:33.697 --> 34:34.897
But who did it?

34:36.226 --> 34:38.652
My professional opinion
as a defense attorney:

34:39.147 --> 34:42.835
homicides are mostly committed
by those closest to the victim.

34:42.992 --> 34:44.704
A spouse, a sibling...

34:45.659 --> 34:46.632
A partner...

34:47.570 --> 34:49.612
That person often feels soon guilt.

34:50.106 --> 34:51.833
Gets close to the family,

34:51.987 --> 34:53.978
helps them out in their time of need.

34:54.078 --> 34:56.597
Do you know anyone
who fits that description, detective?

35:02.127 --> 35:03.658
It's one hell of a city.

35:05.008 --> 35:08.169
I think you'll find
that the system works...

35:09.231 --> 35:10.831
just as it is.

35:11.162 --> 35:13.796
The fact that your name was cleared
proves my point.

35:15.357 --> 35:17.009
And now, if you'll forgive me,

35:17.166 --> 35:18.839
my family is waiting for me.

35:24.866 --> 35:25.826
Coldburn!

35:27.681 --> 35:28.709
This isn't over.

35:31.951 --> 35:32.999
Today, it is.

36:02.150 --> 36:03.121
Hop.

36:03.553 --> 36:04.523
D.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.385
Gotta say I judged you wrong,
last night.

36:09.745 --> 36:11.278
I got some bad intel.

36:11.979 --> 36:13.270
I heard you sold me out.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.276
Something didn't feel right.

36:17.472 --> 36:19.483
So I had a little chat with Baxter.

36:20.283 --> 36:22.472
Turns out, you and me,
we both got played.

36:23.396 --> 36:24.640
I could have told you that.

36:27.870 --> 36:29.102
I know that, now.

36:30.661 --> 36:32.090
I could have ended you, Hop.

36:33.956 --> 36:35.017
But I didn't.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.753
I wanna believe in the family, now.

36:40.418 --> 36:41.768
So I want a clean slate.

36:43.504 --> 36:44.631
Make piece.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.393
I brought you something.

36:56.851 --> 36:57.814
Get out.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.774
I don't know what's going on.

37:08.382 --> 37:10.676
See, this <i>chota,</i>
he tried to sell me out to Booth,

37:11.030 --> 37:12.688
then turn us against each other.

37:13.737 --> 37:15.795
So I say he's lost his right to breathe.

37:16.228 --> 37:18.562
- What do you think?
- Don't listen to him, Brett!

37:18.600 --> 37:20.803
- You know me!
- I know you killed him, Nick.

37:24.081 --> 37:26.231
- What? Are you crazy?
- Why did you do it?

37:26.706 --> 37:28.304
Please, Brett, it's not what you think.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.890
Why did you do it?

37:34.495 --> 37:36.278
It was the Contreras case.

37:37.181 --> 37:38.742
He was gonna bring it all down!

37:38.743 --> 37:40.257
You put the gun in his mouth.

37:40.283 --> 37:43.586
He had no idea
what those people are capable of!

37:43.887 --> 37:45.544
They would have killed your mom!

37:45.564 --> 37:47.785
- Your sister!
- You pulled the trigger.

37:48.102 --> 37:50.551
- I did it for you.
- No you didn't!

37:54.735 --> 37:55.704
You did it for you.

37:55.993 --> 37:57.940
I had no choice!

38:14.787 --> 38:16.347
There's always a choice.

38:21.053 --> 38:22.226
Where are you going?

38:24.638 --> 38:26.433
Brett! Don't leave!

38:29.421 --> 38:30.384
Think of you fa...

38:32.547 --> 38:33.511
I do.

38:34.316 --> 38:35.365
Every day.

39:21.754 --> 39:22.838
Hey, buddy!

39:24.136 --> 39:25.108
Rambis!

39:26.196 --> 39:27.311
Take this.

39:34.671 --> 39:35.936
What made you wanna

39:36.167 --> 39:37.718
finally stay at your place?

39:39.764 --> 39:41.340
I thought we could use a change.

39:45.670 --> 39:46.999
You need new pillows.

39:48.384 --> 39:50.103
- Well...
