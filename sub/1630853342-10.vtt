How do you know you can't make

00:40.127 --> 00:41.128

is what you make it?

Maybe that's the good

of the Neutral Zone.

A narrow band of space
separating the Romulan Empire

01:25.476 --> 01:27.522
from the Federation.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.133
A remnant of a treaty
from 100 years ago,

01:30.177 --> 01:33.093
when a destructive war was waged
between our two cultures.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.661
Enterprise and the USSCayuga
are here to help the outposts

01:36.705 --> 01:38.576
that guard the Neutral Zone
with much needed

01:38.620 --> 01:40.665

We already had spaghetti
last night.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.899
I'm making pasta mama.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.642
Just add eggs, parmesan...

transforms from leftovers

02:05.603 --> 02:08.389
-into something new.
-Mm.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.304
Little like what we're doing
to these outposts.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.175
Not as tasty, though.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.224
Keep hearing rumors the Romulans
are developing new weapons.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.226
Ah, the Romulans
are the bogeymen.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.575
No one's ever seen one.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.229
Nobody even knows
what they look like,

02:22.272 --> 02:25.145
and yet they get blamed
for a lot of things around here.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.799
Some actually their fault.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.978
You know,

02:33.022 --> 02:34.197
I think I miss the beard.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.851
Yeah, I...

02:35.894 --> 02:38.245

to a different era of captain.

Thought that's what you were
going for: man out of time.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.210
How have you been holding up?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.778
Someone told me
I have better places to be,

02:49.821 --> 02:51.867
so I'm trying to be there.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.608
Better places.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.132
And how's that going?

02:57.481 --> 02:58.787
You tell me.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.446
Much as I love you
being mysterious,

03:05.489 --> 03:07.709
I've got a date on the far side
of the Neutral Zone.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.101
Mmm.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.103
Anyone I know?

03:11.147 --> 03:13.018
Not that kind of date, actually.

You know, I'm making osso bucco

03:14.716 --> 03:15.891
next week, if you're interested.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.501
I mean, I'm always curious

03:17.545 --> 03:19.677
who the Chris of tomorrow
is gonna be.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.984
Beard, no beard.

How do you plan to fix
our supply chain problems?

03:34.301 --> 03:36.259
Under the proposed
retrofit directive,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.782
every outpost will be equipped

from the asteroid itself.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.136

each receive a set

03:44.180 --> 03:47.096

that can be operated remotely.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.535
How does this sound?

03:51.579 --> 03:53.145
Sounds like what I've been

03:53.189 --> 03:55.060
asking for
for the last five years.

gets a little excited.
-It's totally fine.

I'm here because that letter
you're about to write

is going to wreck the future.

how to save the cadets
and yourself.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.263
And you do.

We do.

You write to all of them,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.616

not to be there that day.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.011
there are, uh...

...unforeseen consequences.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.146
Well, how bad can it be

if I figure out a way to save
all the cadets and myself?

evidence that I pull it off?

09:47.935 --> 09:49.023
Yes.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.898
Causality is complex.

the first domino

09:56.508 --> 09:58.075

of events

09:58.119 --> 10:01.209
that leads to
catastrophic results.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.689
It alters the future

10:02.732 --> 10:05.735
in ways that we never
intended to change.

This is
"end of the world" stuff.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.416

10:34.459 --> 10:37.114
put your own fate
before the fate of the galaxy.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.086
Well, it's time crystal stuff.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.870
Approaching this logically,

13:47.914 --> 13:49.959
time travel seems
a less likely solution

13:50.003 --> 13:52.092
than that you are
compromised mentally.

13:52.135 --> 13:55.443
And as your first officer,
in these circumstances,

13:55.486 --> 13:56.966
it is my job to assume command.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.708
I agree. If I was
mentally compromised.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.101
But I am not.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.844
So, what's the logical solution?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.410
Perhaps the doctor
could do a full scan.

14:06.454 --> 14:07.890
Why don't we try a mind meld?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.110
That way you'll know
if I'm lying or not.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.298
My mind to your mind.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.867
My thoughts to your thoughts.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.528
[screaming]

14:38.921 --> 14:40.314
You...

14:40.357 --> 14:43.317
carry the weight
of a terrible future, Chris.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.190
The accident in question
was six months ago.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.933
In this timeline,

14:50.977 --> 14:54.241
there were no cadets
at the reactor incident to save.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.503
No one was even hurt.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.461
I need your help, Spock.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.464
I was sent forward to this
moment in time for a reason.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.857
We have to figure out why.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.598
I would posit
that in this present,

15:03.641 --> 15:05.469
you were never injured
in the training accident,

15:05.513 --> 15:07.776
thus, you remained captain
of the Enterprise,

15:07.819 --> 15:09.299
putting you in charge
at a crucial moment

15:09.343 --> 15:10.997
in the ship's existence.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.738
A moment where the whole future
hangs in the balance.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.262
All we can surmise

15:15.305 --> 15:16.872
is that, in the prime future,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.048
some other captain
of the Enterprise

15:19.092 --> 15:20.571
must have commanded it
differently.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.313
Thus, it is imperative
you do not change

15:23.357 --> 15:24.924
what you would normally do
on the ship.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
I thought we were trying
to avoid a terrible future.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.972
We are trying to discover
why this future is,

15:30.016 --> 15:32.932
in the estimation
of your older self, worse...

15:32.975 --> 15:35.456
So the only way to discover
the terrible future...

15:36.936 --> 15:38.024
...is to live it.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.906
ORTEGAS:
Enterprise is in position
and holding, sir.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.603
Just out of weapons range.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.302
Detecting a fair amount

15:55.345 --> 15:56.781
of debris, but no sign
of any attacking ship.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.392
Let's triple check.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.133
Nyota, see if there are
any other Federation ships

16:00.176 --> 16:01.786
in the vicinity,
in case we need backup.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.963
The Farragutis closest.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.051
A couple hours away.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.838
That's La'An's ship, sir.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.972
Yes. I'd forgotten.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.454
Sir, we're being hailed.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.327
It's the outpost. Audio only.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.938
AL-SALAH:
Enterprise, can you read me?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.158
This is Commander
Hansen Al-Salah.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
This is Pike.
What's your status?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.815
Outposts Two, Three
and Eight are gone.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.383
Unknown weapon
completely destroyed.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.559
We had our deflector shields
on maximum.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.083
Hit by enormous power.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.781
First attack
blew through our shields.

16:39.824 --> 16:43.698
If they hit us again
with our deflectors gone...

16:43.741 --> 16:45.352
Do you read me,Enterprise?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.397
What hit you, Commander?
What vessel? Can you identify?

16:47.441 --> 16:48.659
Negative.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.705
It all happened so fast.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.012
And it seems to have
disappeared somehow.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.144
Switching to visual.

16:55.188 --> 16:58.713
Enterprise, can you see?

16:58.756 --> 17:00.715
My command post here--

17:00.758 --> 17:03.413
we're a mile deep,
on an asteroid,

17:03.457 --> 17:05.981
-[alarm blaring]
-almost solid iron,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.375
and even through
our deflectors, it did this.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.463
Can you see?

17:09.506 --> 17:11.508
We see, Hansen.

17:11.552 --> 17:12.727
Was your son with you?

17:12.770 --> 17:14.729
No, thank God.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.472
What can you tell us
about the attacker?

17:18.515 --> 17:19.908
No identity.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.302
Only a glimpse of...

17:22.345 --> 17:24.434
Then it fired something at us.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.436
High-energy plasma.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.743
Fantastic power.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.834
Vessel seems to have
disappeared,

17:32.877 --> 17:34.575
but it is out there somewhere.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.621
[panting]
Enterprise,

17:37.665 --> 17:39.797
there's something's
on our sensors moving fast.

17:39.841 --> 17:40.798
Send us your signal.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.757
Switching.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.673
Enterprise, can you see,
in the center of my screen?

17:45.716 --> 17:47.588
-Phasers?
-Still out of range, sir.

17:47.631 --> 17:49.155
We're out of range, Commander.
Do you have weapons?

17:49.198 --> 17:50.591
Negative. Phasers gone.

17:50.634 --> 17:51.809
Weapon crew are all dead.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.333
Hail them. Warn that ship off.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.509
I'm trying.
They're not acknowledging us.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.907
Aah!

18:25.060 --> 18:27.280
Interesting how they became
visible for just a moment.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.890
Perhaps necessary
to use weapons.

18:28.933 --> 18:32.763
Sir. We have to find a way
to engage them.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.504
We need something
to follow, Lieutenant.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.810
We have no visuals.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.160
Analyzing their movement
patterns now.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.857
Give me a moment.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.559
Sir? Incoming warp signature.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.343
We're being hailed.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.477
It's one of ours. The Farragut.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.348
La'An's ship?

18:52.392 --> 18:54.263
-Who's hailing us?
-UHURA: Their captain.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.786
James Kirk.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.615
Sam's brother?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.184
Uh... I mean, uh...

19:02.228 --> 19:03.533
On screen.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.798
Enterprise,this is
Captain James T. Kirk

19:07.842 --> 19:11.237
of the USS Farragut,
offering assistance.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.676
Christopher Pike.
Good to see you, Captain.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.069
We received Outpost Four's
distress signal

19:18.113 --> 19:20.289
and pushed warp nine
for as long as we safely could.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.508
Do we know who did this?

19:21.551 --> 19:22.944
We have a pretty good idea.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.641
We're trying to determine,
conclusively.

19:25.599 --> 19:26.643
I may have a lead, sir.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.471
The ship in question

19:28.515 --> 19:30.212
appears to have
a kind of cloaking device.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.562
But they still have a detectable
gravitational presence.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.912
So, can we track it,
Commander...?

19:34.956 --> 19:35.957
Spock.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.567
Theoretically, yes.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.656
By detecting the microlensing
of background stars

19:39.700 --> 19:41.310
we can determine
an approximate location.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.877
Impressive, Mr. Spock.

19:42.920 --> 19:43.921
Where's the intruder now?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.839
He has changed heading.
At a very leisurely maneuver.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.102
-They may not be aware of us.
-How can that be true?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.756
They had to decloak to fire.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.497
Their device may work both ways:

19:54.541 --> 19:56.195
it makes them invisible
to our sensors,

19:56.238 --> 19:58.371
but requires
a massive amount of energy.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.024
They are likely flying blind,

20:00.068 --> 20:01.591
without enough power
to run their scanners.

20:01.635 --> 20:04.507
So, we can't see them
but they can't see us.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.385
His heading is now
1-1-1, mark 1-4.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.300
The exact heading
a Romulan vessel would take

20:14.343 --> 20:15.953
toward the Neutral Zone
and home.

20:15.997 --> 20:19.043
Sir, it's the Romulans.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.306
We have to take them out.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.655
We can't enter the Neutral Zone.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.004
Starfleet is clear on this.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.397
We do, that's considered
an act of war.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.094
They've destroyed
three of our outposts.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.617
That's not an act of war?

20:27.661 --> 20:29.184
We attack the Romulans
without authorization,

20:29.228 --> 20:30.794
the Federation
will consider us expendable.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.666
KIRK:
We do have another option.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.145
We can shadow the ship.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.757
Follow a parallel course,
to buy us some time.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.107
-Not an intercept course, sir?
-No.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.456
The captain is right.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.805
That would be
a declaration of war.

20:41.849 --> 20:42.850
But ifEnterprise andFarragut

20:42.893 --> 20:44.025
match course and speed

20:44.068 --> 20:45.592
with the enemy ship, exactly,

20:45.635 --> 20:46.984
move for move,

20:47.028 --> 20:48.812
they might think
we're just a reflection.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.379
Echoes on their sensors.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.946
That way we won't lose them

20:51.989 --> 20:54.514
while we wait to hear back
from Starfleet.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.690
Let's start shadowing them.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.996
Uhura, send a message
to Starfleet.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.390
Ask for permission
to engage the Romulans.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.913
Captain Kirk, we'll be talking.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.176
I look forward to it. Kirk out.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.487
Get Sam Kirk up here, ASAP.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.534
Am I off the record here, sir?

21:15.926 --> 21:18.015
Jim was always
at the top of his class.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.584
He's smart and highly
skilled, obviously,

21:21.628 --> 21:24.326
but he's not above
relying on charm

21:24.370 --> 21:25.849
or even luck.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.851
Sounds like a wild card.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.288
A whole deck of 'em.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.813
He doesn't like to take the path
everyone else does.

21:32.856 --> 21:35.468
And he doesn't like to lose.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.084
Should we be worried that
he's going to start a war?

21:45.391 --> 21:48.872
Look, I'm not gonna say that
Jim isn't a pain in the ass.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.092
He is.
He's a huge pain in the ass.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.224
But the truth is,

21:53.268 --> 21:56.140
he's as fine a captain
as Starfleet has.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.795
-Okay. Good to know.
-Like I said,

21:58.839 --> 22:01.276
he does like
to bend the rules sometimes.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.974
No, more like all the time.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.108
SPOCK:
Captain, can you come
to the bridge?

22:07.151 --> 22:08.675
There is something
you should see.

22:09.589 --> 22:10.894
UHURA:
There's a comet ahead,

22:10.938 --> 22:12.287
and its trail
is reflecting a signal

22:12.331 --> 22:14.115
on an unused EM frequency.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.031
It is encoded.
Mr. Spock is trying to decipher.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.207
But we think it might
be from the enemy ship.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.124
They cut off transmission,
but we managed to make a copy.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.909
I think it's the feed
from their bridge, sir.

22:25.953 --> 22:29.217
So, we're finally going to see
what the Romulans look like.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.959
Put it on screen,
please, Mr. Spock.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.534
♪

23:11.477 --> 23:12.608
PIKE:
Captain Kirk,

23:12.652 --> 23:14.044
welcome aboard the Enterprise.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.089
Thanks, Captain Pike.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.395
Sam.

23:20.877 --> 23:21.922
Quite the ship you got here.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.227
He's jealous.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.620
[chuckling]

23:27.362 --> 23:29.146
Well, we're not gonna
get out of this problem

23:29.190 --> 23:31.453
by not talking about it.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.150
Agreed.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.979
I'd like to hear what Mr. Spock
has to say for himself.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.459
I assure you, Lieutenant,

23:37.503 --> 23:39.461
the similarities between
Vulcans and Romulans

23:39.505 --> 23:41.071
came as a surprise to me.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.377
Perhaps even more so than you.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.335
It does seem suspicious.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.728
Not the similarity itself,

23:45.772 --> 23:47.077
but that we should
discover it right now.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.818
What are you suggesting?

23:48.862 --> 23:50.341
Well, it's no secret
that the Vulcans and the humans

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
are in alliance.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.389
Perhaps the Romulans allowed us
to see that transmission

23:54.433 --> 23:56.522
in hopes that it would
sow discord

23:56.565 --> 23:59.046
-among us.
-ORTEGAS: Even if we ignore

23:59.089 --> 24:00.482
the pointy-eared elephant
in the room,

24:00.526 --> 24:02.702
we have another problem
to worry about.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.051
We're going to lose our prey.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.531
MITCHELL:
The Romulans are on a bearing

24:05.574 --> 24:07.358
to return to the Neutral Zone
in an hour.

24:07.402 --> 24:08.795
KIRK:
I don't think we can wait.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.492
We have to make a choice here.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.928
SPOCK:
Say we do make that choice.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.321
Their plasma weapon

24:13.364 --> 24:14.888
can still slice through
our shields.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.890
That, in conjunction
with their cloaking device,

24:16.933 --> 24:18.369
gives them a tactical advantage.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.502
Even against our ships
working in tandem.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.286
M'BENGA:
Working in tandem for what?

24:22.330 --> 24:23.853
To destroy them?

24:25.159 --> 24:26.900
Say we're lucky
enough to do that.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.685
Isn't that, technically,

24:29.729 --> 24:30.991
an act of war?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.993
ORTEGAS:
I hate to say it, Doc,

24:33.036 --> 24:34.690
but they started it.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.257
This isn't a schoolyard.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.477
Billions of lives
are at stake here.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.697
Which is why I want to hear
everyone's opinion

24:41.741 --> 24:43.438
before we take any action.

24:44.831 --> 24:48.008
-I vote against war.
-ORTEGAS: So do I.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.793
I just think that means
killing Romulans.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.668
Captain, your thoughts?

24:58.409 --> 25:00.063
What happens when
they return to Romulus

25:00.107 --> 25:01.587
and tell their leaders

25:01.630 --> 25:03.806
that the Federation
won't even fight back?

25:04.764 --> 25:06.635
I'm starting to lean
toward attack.

25:06.679 --> 25:09.769
If we allow them to destroy our
outposts with no repercussions,

25:09.812 --> 25:11.292
we run the risk of war.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.381
Have to believe
there's another way forward.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.078
I think we should attack.

25:16.384 --> 25:17.603
Mr. Spock?

25:17.646 --> 25:18.995
SPOCK:
If the Romulans

25:19.039 --> 25:20.606
are an offshoot
of my Vulcan blood,

25:20.649 --> 25:21.998
which I believe,

25:22.042 --> 25:23.957
then attack is indeed
the only option.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.436
Vulcan, like Earth,

25:25.480 --> 25:27.438
had its aggressive
colonizing period.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.702
Savage, even by human standards.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.574
If the Romulans retain
this martial philosophy,

25:32.618 --> 25:35.185
then weakness is something
we dare not show.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.753
ORTEGAS:
Well,

25:37.797 --> 25:39.233
if Spock and I can agree,

25:39.276 --> 25:40.887
then there's hope for all of us.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.758
We don't all agree.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.283
KIRK:
Hold a moment. Captain Pike,

25:46.327 --> 25:48.198
that comet we're approaching

25:48.242 --> 25:50.679
might just be the alternative
that you've been looking for.

25:50.723 --> 25:54.553
Mr. Spock, can you put up the
trajectory on screen, please?

25:54.596 --> 25:56.032
Currently, the Romulan ship

25:56.076 --> 25:57.512
is headed for the comet's tail.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.992
Now, I know
that they're invisible

25:59.035 --> 26:00.994
and we can't lock on
to their exact position.

26:01.037 --> 26:03.431
But the second
they go through that,

26:03.474 --> 26:05.607
particle distortion
will reveal their location.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.827
And we'll be flanking them
on either side.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.264
They'll be pendent and we'll be
able to get weapons locked.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.266
Good plan, Captain.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.663
Captain's personal log,
stardate 1709.2.

26:17.706 --> 26:20.796
Per Captain Kirk's plan,
we are mounting a pincer move.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.842
Our two ships
will slowly drift closer

26:22.885 --> 26:25.061
as the Romulans remain unaware.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.759
When they pass through
the comet's tail

26:26.802 --> 26:28.325
giving us their exact location,

26:28.369 --> 26:30.371
we will be in weapons range.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.243
Kirk, however,
has agreed to my plan

26:33.287 --> 26:35.637
to neutralize, not destroy,
the Bird-of-Prey,

26:35.681 --> 26:38.161
leaving open
the possibility of dialogue.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.468
And yet I remain concerned

26:40.511 --> 26:44.298
this brash, young Starfleet
captain follows his own rules.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.648
I can't help but wonder,

26:46.692 --> 26:48.911
is Kirk the reason
I was sent here?

26:48.955 --> 26:50.870
If I wasn't here to stop him,

26:50.913 --> 26:52.654
would we be lead into a war?

26:52.698 --> 26:55.091
Ortegas, maintain
present course, but be ready.

26:55.135 --> 26:58.617
I'll keep my foot over
the gas, just in case.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.142
SPOCK:
Still tracking
the gravitational presence

27:02.185 --> 27:03.926
of the Romulans.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.885
Their trajectory
remains unchanged.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.451
Holding position.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.670
Let us know when you see them,
Enterprise.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.498
We're passing through the tail.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.456
Any second now.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.685
[indistinct chatter over comm]

27:26.514 --> 27:28.124
Something isn't right.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.344
The captain is correct.
We should have seen them by now.

27:30.387 --> 27:31.171
KIRK:
Enterprise,

27:31.214 --> 27:32.912
I don't like this.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.522
SPOCK:
Reading gravitational
signature again.

27:34.565 --> 27:35.915
It's behind the Farragut.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.308
-Kirk, get out of there!
-Red Alert!

27:38.352 --> 27:39.919
Red Alert.
Erica, close that distance

27:39.962 --> 27:41.181
as fast as you can.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.009
Attack pattern Tiberius 4.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.714
Get behind them.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.461
Fire!

28:02.245 --> 28:03.725
[grunting]

28:15.084 --> 28:17.521
[alarms blaring]

28:20.437 --> 28:22.178
Fire phasers, Captain.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.832
We're out of range. We're just
as likely to hit you as them.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.225
Maybe you'll draw their fire.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.314
Mitchell, full phasers, now.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.235
Holy...
We actually clipped them.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.671
Nice shooting, Jenna.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.020
Nyota, hail them.
I want them focused on us.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.805
Hailing, sir.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.632
Keep firing.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.861
MITCHELL:
They're firing
their plasma weapon.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.298
Brace for impact!

29:01.565 --> 29:03.959
Damage to Decks Six,
Seven, and Nine.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.744
And weapon control is down.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.528
That should have destroyed us.
How are we still standing?

29:07.571 --> 29:08.747
SPOCK:
They were shooting
at a distance.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.096
Perhaps their plasma weapon

29:10.139 --> 29:11.619
is less effective
when fired long range.

29:11.662 --> 29:12.707
Status of the Farragut?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.491
Critical.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.537
They will lose life support
inside of five minutes.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.234
I can get us there
in 30 seconds.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.193
Pike to transporter.
Get the pads warmed up, Chief.

29:20.236 --> 29:21.803
We're about to test
their upper limits.

29:24.719 --> 29:27.461
Clear the pads. There's
one more group behind us.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.943
[sighs] Am I glad to see you.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.598
Oh, um...

29:34.642 --> 29:36.862
I didn't know you were
a hugger, Lieutenant.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.777
Oh, Commander.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.736
Or have you forgotten?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.824
I d...
Of course I haven't.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
Uh, uh, speaking of...

29:44.391 --> 29:46.262
when's the last time
you've talked to Una?

29:48.003 --> 29:50.527
Well, I-I can't talk to her.

29:50.571 --> 29:51.746
No one can. It...

29:53.443 --> 29:54.793
She's not allowed contact.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.664
Of course.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.579
[trilling]

29:58.622 --> 29:59.667
KIRK:
Captain Pike.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.451
We need to talk. Now.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.632
You flinched.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.766
You deliberated and we lost.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.376
We fired, Captain.
And we were fired upon.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.551
That's why you're still here.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.075
From the start,

30:16.118 --> 30:17.685
you wanted to cripple them,
not take them out.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.253
We may have different
points of view,

30:20.296 --> 30:23.299
but do not question
my combat readiness, Captain.

30:23.343 --> 30:26.433
I'm saying caution means
you're not going to put

30:26.476 --> 30:28.391
everything you have
into the punch.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
And that's a good way to lose,

30:30.002 --> 30:32.874
because your enemy will see that
and act accordingly.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.789
All this because
of a second's delay?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.836
Tell me I'm wrong, Captain,

30:37.879 --> 30:39.359
and I will back down.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.143
If you're saying
you're more willing

30:41.187 --> 30:43.015
to take risks than I am,
I don't disagree.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.452
And let me remind you that
you're saying that on my ship,

30:45.495 --> 30:46.975
after yours has been destroyed.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.111
Fair.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.896
I'm just saying
I underestimated him.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.593
I'm not going to do it again.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.422
SPOCK:
Captains Pike and Kirk
to the bridge.

30:59.466 --> 31:01.250
There is something
you'll both want to see.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.254
[door whooshes open]

31:06.255 --> 31:09.519
Before they cloaked, I was able
to scan the Bird-of-Prey.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.956
They are trailing
trilithium fragments.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.174
Their power supply is damaged.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.610
I do not believe
they have enough

31:13.654 --> 31:14.916
to make it back to Romulus.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.875
-Do we know their position?
-Yes.

31:16.918 --> 31:17.919
On a heading
for the Neutral Zone.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.181
We could overtake them.

31:19.225 --> 31:20.574
What's the status
of our weapons?

31:20.617 --> 31:22.054
Our offensive capabilities
are limited.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.751
Phasers are down.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.405
And torpedo launch tubes
sustained damage in the attack.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.146
But the Romulans
don't know that.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.930
They will if we pull up
on their six and can't fire.

31:28.974 --> 31:32.238
Lieutenant Uhura, open
a channel to the Romulan ship.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.980
Sir? They haven't responded
to any of our hails before.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.720
I know. Open a channel.

31:36.764 --> 31:39.027
We're going to
send them a message.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.202
What are you doing?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.119
Taking a risk.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.257
This is Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS Enterprise.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.695
Our two cultures have been
at war for 100 years.

31:54.738 --> 31:57.393
Long enough that
we don't even question it.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.656
But I believe we can
make another choice.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.181
Right now.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.357
I'm offering you
a temporary cease-fire,

32:04.400 --> 32:05.619
so that we can talk.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.840
For the first time in 100 years.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.982
Okay. That was... unexpected.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.942
They want to destroy us,
but they also want to get home.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.247
Knowing what your opponent wants

32:25.291 --> 32:26.814
is key to a successful
negotiation.

32:26.857 --> 32:29.425
That's assuming
they can be negotiated with.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.430
Captain Pike,
the Romulans are calling.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.779
Looks like we're about
to find out.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.260
On screen, please, Nyota.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.179
Captain Pike,

32:44.223 --> 32:47.400
it is good to make
your acquaintance.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.151
Commander.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.414
I know your ships
attacked our outposts

33:01.457 --> 33:02.806
on the edge of the Neutral Zone.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.504
But I also know

33:04.547 --> 33:06.593
that our two cultures
have been at war for generations

33:06.636 --> 33:08.290
without ever having been
face-to-face.

33:08.334 --> 33:11.728
I don't know why
your ancestors attacked Earth

33:11.772 --> 33:13.600
or what my ancestors did
in retaliation.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.210
I only know that
we're paying a bill

33:15.254 --> 33:17.386
that was written long before
you and I were ever born.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.693
Perhaps it's time
we reconsider the cost.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.826
So, we can blow each other
out of the sky

33:22.870 --> 33:25.003
using what little power
we have left,

33:25.046 --> 33:26.656
or we can try
something different.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.311
We can explain ourselves
to each other.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.270
Understand each other.
Empathize.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.968
If we don't, this war between us

33:34.012 --> 33:36.188
will simply continue, unabated.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.754
And the cost for that is sure.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.017
Death.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.021
More and more death.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.199
Our peoples are indeed
different, Captain.

33:47.242 --> 33:50.202
In our culture, your words
are a show of weakness.

33:50.245 --> 33:54.423
What chance does dialogue offer,
save to delay me?

33:54.467 --> 33:56.077
Why should I listen to you?

33:56.121 --> 33:57.861
PIKE:
Both our ships are damaged.
Your cloak

33:57.905 --> 34:00.038
is unstable, which leaves you
vulnerable to our weapons.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.909
Maybe you have
enough power to attack us.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.345
Maybe you have enough power

34:03.389 --> 34:05.086
to get back to Romulus
without repairs.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.653
Conversely,

34:06.696 --> 34:08.220
maybe we can marshal
our weapons and destroy you

34:08.263 --> 34:09.873
before you make it
to the Neutral Zone.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.137
Or perhaps we chase you
across the border

34:12.180 --> 34:14.965
and destroy you and get out
before anyone's the wiser.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.577
So what is it that
you're suggesting, Captain?

34:17.620 --> 34:19.100
A good faith gesture.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.884
Two hours.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.104
Enough time to repair
our ships and bury the dead.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.540
And maybe this bit of mercy

34:24.584 --> 34:27.413
will lead to something
further and better

34:27.456 --> 34:28.979
between our two cultures.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.037
Two hours.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.091
Captain.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.223
They are lying.

34:55.267 --> 34:56.920
Romulans can't be trusted.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.618
They shot Farragut
right in front of us.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.228
Stand down, Erica.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.490
You can't let them
get away with it!

35:01.534 --> 35:02.796
Stand down!

35:07.192 --> 35:08.236
Yes, sir.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.334
Sensor readings suggest

35:19.378 --> 35:21.467
the Romulans have stopped
forward movement.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.865
I wonder what they're doing
over there.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.476
Hopefully...

35:32.391 --> 35:34.001
...same thing we are.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.569
SUBCOMMANDER:
A cease-fire?

35:36.612 --> 35:39.398
This is Federation weakness.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.051
Is it not the Romulan way

35:41.095 --> 35:42.923
to attack when we are given
advantage like this?

35:42.966 --> 35:45.186
We are engaged in a cease-fire,
Subcommander.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.492
We have two hours.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.363
Put all hands
to repair our engines.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.974
If we do not, we will not
make it back to Romulus.

35:51.018 --> 35:54.413
Sir, we should commit all hands
to weapons repair.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.893
The Federation
has given us the advantage.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.287
We can strike before
this ridiculous cease-fire

35:59.331 --> 36:00.506
is completed.

36:07.774 --> 36:11.169
This is your fourth mission,
is it not, Subcommander?

36:11.212 --> 36:13.127
Third, sir.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.825
I served with your Uncle Tarqan
during the Reman campaign,

36:15.869 --> 36:17.349
did you know that, Subcommander?

36:17.392 --> 36:18.872
I did.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.179
His death was
a great victory for Romulus.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.051
Yes, he was brave.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.314
His commander, however,
was a fool.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.317
He forced him to fight
after we'd lost weapons,

36:29.361 --> 36:31.537
and the only
logical choice was retreat.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.234
He did not have to die.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.627
Sir?

36:34.670 --> 36:36.498
His death was a waste.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.935
And it was stupid.
It left us weaker.

36:38.979 --> 36:42.591
Now, I can say that
because I'm old enough

36:42.635 --> 36:44.854
and I don't care
what people think of me.

36:44.898 --> 36:48.467
Pride is not something
we can afford.

36:48.510 --> 36:51.339
We look at the world
clearly on my ship.

36:51.383 --> 36:54.124
We do not make choices
based on ego.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.822
Engines first.

36:55.865 --> 36:58.085
Then, weapons. That is my order.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.435
Or are you so arrogant

37:00.479 --> 37:02.481
you think you know better
than your Commander?

37:03.656 --> 37:04.613
No, sir.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.875
Good.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.008
Because I need you.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.576
I don't know if this peace game

37:10.619 --> 37:12.491
we're playing with
the Federation will work.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.275
But I have to see it through.

37:14.319 --> 37:17.278
And if we achieve it,
then, good.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.584
But if not?

37:20.325 --> 37:22.414
Then you'll get your war.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.776
Do you want some coffee?

37:37.777 --> 37:40.606
I do not drink coffee.
I do drink tea.

37:40.649 --> 37:42.129
All right,
Would you like some tea?

37:42.172 --> 37:43.391
No, thank you, Captain.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.525
[chuckling]

37:47.482 --> 37:49.789
Well, the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.532
It's good to see you're
still you, Spock.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.971
So many things
have gone wrong today.

37:58.928 --> 37:59.842
[sighs]

37:59.886 --> 38:01.844
The loss of Outpost Four.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.629
The destruction of the Farragut.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.285
Any one of them could set us
on a path to a dark future.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.766
But I can't help feeling...

38:12.420 --> 38:14.379
...that there's something
worse to come.

38:14.422 --> 38:19.035
Typically, no one can know
the future in the moment.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.777
One can only follow
one's instincts

38:21.821 --> 38:23.475
and hope the truth
will present itself.

38:24.432 --> 38:25.651
Spock...

38:27.087 --> 38:28.175
...what happened to Una?

38:28.218 --> 38:29.872
She was sentenced to

38:29.916 --> 38:32.005
the Federation penal colony
on Salius Six,

38:32.048 --> 38:34.181
where she has spent
much of the last seven years.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.835
Why?

38:35.878 --> 38:37.880
Her deception.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.927
I am confused.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.842
Even years ago,
I thought you knew.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.889
-[door chimes]
-Come.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.112
SPOCK:
If you'll excuse me,
I wish to supervise

38:52.155 --> 38:54.419
the repair of the phaser
array personally.

38:57.465 --> 38:58.510
Captain.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.034
Captain.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.821
[door whooshes shut]

39:05.865 --> 39:08.998
I know you want me
to change tack, but

39:09.042 --> 39:11.349
pride is just not something
we can afford.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.525
You want me to tell you
that I wouldn't have tried

39:13.568 --> 39:15.527
to blow those Romulans
out of the sky?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.006
Well, I would have.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.879
But it wasn't my call.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.576
Okay. We're here, now.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.013
And the truth is...

39:24.057 --> 39:27.408
I don't know these Romulans
can't be trusted.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.585
But I also don't know
if they can.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.282
And neither do you.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.546
Fair enough.

39:36.286 --> 39:38.767
I'd like to explore
a backup plan.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.858
If you'll give me the resources.

39:43.816 --> 39:44.730
I'm listening.

39:44.773 --> 39:46.035
Look, the Romulans

39:46.079 --> 39:47.472
just bought themselves
some time.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.865
Sure, they can use that time
to make repairs.

39:49.909 --> 39:53.303
But remember, they're on
the edge of the Neutral Zone.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.654
They could also use it
to call for reinforcements.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.743
So,

39:57.786 --> 39:59.353
what if we did the same?

39:59.397 --> 40:02.225
Just in case they decide
to turn and fight after all.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.228
Jim, we're on the far edge
of Federation space.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.970
It takes days
to get a message to Starfleet.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.624
We're weeks away
from help getting to us,

40:09.668 --> 40:11.060
even at maximum warp.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.415
But the Romulans
don't know that.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.027
Captain Kirk...

40:22.724 --> 40:24.378
...what are you suggesting?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.424
Captain Pike...

40:27.860 --> 40:30.428
...can I borrow a shuttle?

40:52.319 --> 40:53.842
Try it now.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.844
ENGINEER [Scottish accent]:
Aye, that's the one.

40:55.888 --> 40:57.846
This is where the auto repair
was getting hung up.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.587
She's very fused.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.198
I do not need to remind you
that we have less than two hours

41:02.242 --> 41:04.462
to restore phaser control
to working order.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.594
ENGINEER:
I'm an engineer,
not a miracle worker,

41:06.638 --> 41:08.553
Mr. Spock.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.511
Two minutes, Captain.

41:10.555 --> 41:11.512
Status?

41:11.556 --> 41:12.992
MITCHELL:
We have engines,

41:13.035 --> 41:14.776
but weapons systems
are not back online.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.865
Bridge to Spock. Status?

41:16.909 --> 41:18.084
Working on it, Captain.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.215
Working on it.

41:19.259 --> 41:20.434
UHURA:
Two hours, Captain.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.655
And... mark.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.927
Open a channel
to the Romulan ship.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.322
Have you repaired
your ship, Commander?

41:39.366 --> 41:41.499
Have you repaired
yours, Captain?

41:42.717 --> 41:44.153
Conventional wisdom suggests

41:44.197 --> 41:45.677
that our next move
is to resume hostilities.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.330
To fight.

41:47.374 --> 41:49.115
You yourself told me
that in your culture

41:49.158 --> 41:51.073
to do anything else
would be a sign of weakness.

41:51.117 --> 41:54.033
But let me tell you a way
in which humans are not weak.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.644
Our strength comes from our
willingness to see a partner

41:56.688 --> 41:58.037
instead of an enemy.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.517
In our culture, that is an act

41:59.560 --> 42:01.519
of faith and strength,

42:01.562 --> 42:03.564
not a failure of character.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.523
Do Romulans have
that kind of strength?

42:12.442 --> 42:16.185
I too tire of endless war.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.064
[intermittent beeping]

42:25.107 --> 42:26.979
[alarm blaring]

42:46.912 --> 42:49.044
Why is the fleet here?
I did not call for them.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.438
I alerted them
of our situation, Commander.

42:51.481 --> 42:54.049
The Federation showed weakness.

42:54.093 --> 42:56.095
It is the Romulan way to strike.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.923
You were not going to.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.751
I took matters
into my own hands.

42:59.794 --> 43:02.362
You disobeyed a direct order.

43:02.405 --> 43:03.885
Had you not negotiated
with the Federation,

43:03.929 --> 43:05.234
I would not have needed to.

43:05.278 --> 43:07.497
We undertook
this mission to test

43:07.541 --> 43:09.499
the strength of the Federation.

43:09.543 --> 43:11.066
They showed us they lack it.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.546
We should have destroyed them

43:12.590 --> 43:14.243
-the moment they did.
-You don't remember

43:14.287 --> 43:16.594
a time without war.

43:16.637 --> 43:17.769
But I do.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.685
Who wins an endless war
with the Federation?

43:20.728 --> 43:22.643
We will, Commander.

43:22.687 --> 43:26.125
An endless war,
by definition, can never be won.

43:27.082 --> 43:28.910
Captain Pike
will not trust my word now.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.651
What does that matter?

43:31.565 --> 43:33.001
He will be dead soon.

43:33.045 --> 43:34.220
[scoffs]

43:35.134 --> 43:37.223
Take him off the bridge.

43:51.454 --> 43:53.152
UHURA:
We're being hailed, sir.

43:53.195 --> 43:54.806
It's the Romulan flagship.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.024
On screen.

43:57.983 --> 43:59.724
Human.

43:59.767 --> 44:02.248
I am here to accept
your unconditional surrender.

44:02.291 --> 44:03.771
Nice to meet you, too.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.120
I'm Captain Pike

44:05.164 --> 44:06.426
of the Federation
Starship Enterprise.

44:06.469 --> 44:07.514
And you are?

44:07.557 --> 44:09.603
You may address me as Praetor.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.257
It is customary to kneel.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.825
As I'm not a Romulan,
you'll forgive me if I don't.

44:13.868 --> 44:15.522
Now, I'm confused.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.699
We are holding to our side
of the Neutral Zone, as you are.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.092
Yet you demand our surrender?

44:20.135 --> 44:22.616
Captain. I have you surrounded.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.271
Surrender
or we will destroy you.

44:25.314 --> 44:26.925
You have one minute to comply.

44:28.535 --> 44:30.015
You know, I don't like her.

44:30.058 --> 44:31.407
Perimeter alert.

44:31.451 --> 44:33.671
We have ships incoming, sir.
Dozens.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.803
-More Romulans?
-No.

44:35.847 --> 44:37.805
They look like... ours.

44:52.167 --> 44:54.126
I've got a secure channel
from the lead ship, sir.

44:54.169 --> 44:57.433
It's Captain Kirk.

44:57.477 --> 45:00.262
Chris, the reinforcements
you ordered?

45:00.306 --> 45:03.352
Been 100 years
since the Federation

45:03.396 --> 45:04.745
has seen the Romulans.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.573
We didn't know what
their ships looked like,

45:06.616 --> 45:09.184
and so I figured they don't know
what ours look like, either.

45:09.228 --> 45:11.752
All robotic mining craft?

45:11.796 --> 45:14.712
Mining, hauling.
Not one of them manned.

45:14.755 --> 45:16.191
But to the Romulans,

45:16.235 --> 45:19.325
who's to say we aren't
a Federation armada?

45:19.368 --> 45:21.719
You sneaky son of a bitch.

45:21.762 --> 45:24.547
It's enough
to bluff with, I hope.

45:24.591 --> 45:26.114
Try not to get us
in a real fight.

45:26.158 --> 45:28.813
I'll do my best.
Thanks, Captain.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.250
It's my pleasure, Captain.

45:31.293 --> 45:32.904
Bridge to Spock.

45:32.947 --> 45:34.862
We really could use
some phasers right about now.

45:34.906 --> 45:35.863
How's it going down there?

45:35.907 --> 45:37.169
We are making progress.

45:37.212 --> 45:38.474
The conduits
are severely damaged.

45:38.518 --> 45:39.954
Work faster, Mr. Spock.

45:39.998 --> 45:41.390
We're going to need weapons soon

45:41.434 --> 45:42.740
or we're not
going to need them at all.

45:42.783 --> 45:44.132
Romulan praetor
is hailing us, sir.

45:44.176 --> 45:45.612
Keep a secure channel open
for Captain Kirk

45:45.655 --> 45:46.961
so he can listen in.

45:49.964 --> 45:51.444
You ready to sell this?

45:52.401 --> 45:54.099
Ready as I'll ever be.

45:58.799 --> 46:00.540
By now you've probably noticed

46:00.583 --> 46:03.717
our armada of Starfleet
Delta Class attack ships.

46:03.761 --> 46:07.025
But we won't have to use them,
will we, Praetor?

46:07.068 --> 46:08.940
This is an act
of unparalleled aggression

46:08.983 --> 46:10.942
on the border
of our territory, Captain.

46:10.985 --> 46:12.813
No, just a standard
training maneuver

46:12.857 --> 46:14.989
that happened to land our fleet
here the same time as yours.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.339
You want to know
what actually is

46:17.383 --> 46:19.733
an act of unparalleled
aggression?

46:19.777 --> 46:23.128
