00:19.824 --> 00:21.574
What progress, Deschamps?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.500
The Prince is not a patient man.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.120
Uncanny...

00:35.818 --> 00:37.790
Not so close with the candle.

00:39.395 --> 00:41.510
You are indeed an artist.

00:46.855 --> 00:48.105
It is finished.

00:49.638 --> 00:52.045
As skilful with a scalpel and brush,

00:52.729 --> 00:54.329
as I am with a dagger.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.280
You shall feel no pain, my friend.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.370
You give your life
for a place in history.

01:09.868 --> 01:11.218
- Allan!
- What?

01:13.463 --> 01:14.463
Good.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.516
Much! Come on!

01:19.636 --> 01:21.800
You don't go easy
just because it's training!

01:22.107 --> 01:23.920
I'm trying not to hurt you.

01:24.081 --> 01:26.440
You won't hurt him
if you never hit him, will you?

01:26.601 --> 01:28.000
Well, come on, boys!

01:35.841 --> 01:37.360
- Blinding!
- Robin!

01:37.480 --> 01:38.880
Are you all right?

01:39.192 --> 01:41.238
There's a Royal carriage
on the North Road.

01:41.358 --> 01:43.418
Carrying the King's insignia,
not the Prince's.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.560
- Let's go.
- It's heading for Nottingham.

01:45.881 --> 01:48.213
- Come on. Up!
- Get him up.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.274
Come on. Come on!

01:56.641 --> 01:57.841
It's Sheridan.

01:58.108 --> 02:00.040
- Who?
- Keeper of the Crown.

02:02.701 --> 02:05.951
He used to be the King's
favourite trainer of Knights.

02:06.579 --> 02:07.779
He trained me.

02:13.988 --> 02:14.988
No!

02:15.993 --> 02:18.440
No, no, no!

02:23.641 --> 02:25.191
People of Nottingham!

02:26.437 --> 02:28.337
It is to your great sadness,

02:29.407 --> 02:31.407
but also to your great honour,

02:33.047 --> 02:35.197
that you are the first to know...

02:37.125 --> 02:39.080
of the death of King Richard.

02:43.209 --> 02:45.975
The Lionheart met his glorious end

02:46.805 --> 02:49.110
in battle with the Infidel.

03:02.537 --> 03:04.637
I thank you for your sympathy...

03:06.184 --> 03:07.600
and for your love.

03:09.324 --> 03:11.511
The Archbishop of Canterbury
is on his way

03:11.631 --> 03:14.193
to bless my brother's body.

03:14.841 --> 03:18.440
And though these are not
the circumstances I would've wished for,

03:18.601 --> 03:22.120
in the interests of stability
and national security...

03:23.346 --> 03:25.846
... he will also
oversee my coronation.

03:28.795 --> 03:30.145
The King is dead.

03:31.534 --> 03:32.984
Long live the King!

03:34.929 --> 03:36.360
Long live the King!

03:37.092 --> 03:39.142
- Long live the King!
- Kneel.

03:41.068 --> 03:42.518
Get down, get down!

03:44.394 --> 03:45.749
Long live me.

Episode eight
THE KING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE KING...

04:29.748 --> 04:32.758
If this is God's will, then I have
to question His judgement.

04:32.878 --> 04:35.731
- He was a great King, and a good man.
- Don't, Much.

04:35.851 --> 04:37.853
- I'm sorry, Robin.
- He's not dead!

04:37.973 --> 04:39.819
- He can't be!
- Robin, the guards...

04:39.939 --> 04:42.280
John, I'd know if he was dead.
I'd feel it.

04:42.441 --> 04:45.760
- I know.
- This Sheridan, is he a man you trust?

04:46.325 --> 04:48.640
He used to be
one of the King's best.

04:48.801 --> 04:50.960
But now, obviously,
he's gone with Prince John.

04:51.121 --> 04:54.621
- We all share your grief, Robin.
- I need to see his face.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.320
I need to know for sure.

05:05.063 --> 05:07.994
His body is in remarkable condition
for a month at sea.

05:08.114 --> 05:10.720
The Moors.
They're masters of embalming.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.440
<i>Requiescat in pace.</i>

05:22.802 --> 05:25.297
Thank you. He's close to God now.

05:29.071 --> 05:31.320
Why did I not hear of this sooner?

05:31.481 --> 05:33.951
The advanced messenger
came to me in London

05:34.071 --> 05:37.056
only a day before the body
was due to arrive.

05:37.327 --> 05:41.040
I swore the man to secrecy
before meeting it at Hull

05:41.281 --> 05:44.395
in the dead of night and...
coming to the Prince forthwith.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.158
And rightly so, I believe.

05:46.278 --> 05:48.734
There are those who would take advantage
of an interregnum

05:48.854 --> 05:51.760
- to further their own ends.
- I shall consult with the Royal Council.

05:52.531 --> 05:54.560
I am the rightful heir, am I not?

05:59.721 --> 06:00.800
Indeed.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.348
But first...

06:05.795 --> 06:08.745
there will need to be
a state funeral in London.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.346
And there shall be one.
I shall see to it myself.

06:11.466 --> 06:14.416
London was my brother's
seat of power after all.

06:15.504 --> 06:16.504
But...

06:16.927 --> 06:20.820
power, as you know, is finely balanced
between north and south.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.960
And now that the tragic news is out,

06:23.080 --> 06:25.560
any delay could cause
that balance to shift.

06:25.721 --> 06:29.192
Which is why I propose
making my seat, Nottingham,

06:29.312 --> 06:31.162
the new capital of England.

06:33.278 --> 06:35.165
As the claim is uncontested,

06:35.285 --> 06:38.480
I saw no barrier
in bringing the Crown with me.

06:39.251 --> 06:41.000
Everything is in place.

06:45.942 --> 06:46.942
So be it.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.970
We'll move his body to the crypt.

07:16.112 --> 07:17.112
Allan.

07:21.116 --> 07:22.116
Good luck.

07:38.923 --> 07:40.673
There's bodies down here.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.360
That's the idea, Much. Come on.

07:51.441 --> 07:53.738
You can hold my hand
if you get scared.

07:53.858 --> 07:54.858
Thanks.

07:56.635 --> 07:57.958
Much, get off me!

07:58.078 --> 08:00.240
Come on, help me get it off.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
It's him.

08:30.565 --> 08:31.565
It's true.

08:32.955 --> 08:34.855
- Kate, be careful.
- Wait.

08:44.814 --> 08:45.814
God.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.007
It's wax!

08:51.908 --> 08:52.920
What?!

08:53.881 --> 08:56.200
It's a waxwork made
to look like King Richard.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
<i>I knew it!</i>

09:03.067 --> 09:04.760
I knew he was still alive!

09:11.680 --> 09:14.530
Wherever you stick the pin,
the city is yours!

09:21.149 --> 09:23.400
Swindon! Rather you than me!

09:24.356 --> 09:25.640
Come on, who's next?!

09:25.760 --> 09:28.760
London is still up for grabs,
but Nottingham is out of bounds.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.160
Don't want our new capital
in the hands of drunkards, do we?

09:34.200 --> 09:37.480
So tell me, where would a King
desire to put his pin?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.150
In a flatterer's eye.

09:40.278 --> 09:43.491
I actually wanted to give you my
personal congratulations, your highness.

09:43.611 --> 09:44.888
I'm sure you do.

09:45.008 --> 09:48.142
And of course my condolences
for your late brother.

09:48.503 --> 09:51.880
And in the light of your increasing
national responsibilities,

09:52.708 --> 09:54.912
I imagine you will need the loyal

09:55.032 --> 09:57.440
and varied services

09:58.112 --> 10:00.959
that only I could offer you
as a potential Sheriff.

10:01.079 --> 10:03.600
The same sort of services
as you offered Robin Hood?

10:04.954 --> 10:07.680
- No.
- Or your brother offered me?

10:08.100 --> 10:10.250
Robin and Guy mean nothing to me.

10:10.406 --> 10:13.160
Given the opportunity,
I would love to prove that to you.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.600
Why don't you prove it anyway.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.120
And maybe I'll consider you along
with the other candidates for Sheriff.

10:19.430 --> 10:21.030
What other candidates?

10:21.667 --> 10:22.680
Sheridan!

10:23.692 --> 10:26.255
My rock in these troubled times.

10:27.014 --> 10:30.800
- You do love me, don't you?
- With all my heart, Sire.

10:31.771 --> 10:33.601
Perhaps we should use
this distraction

10:33.721 --> 10:35.922
to finish our night's business
at the abbey

10:36.042 --> 10:38.400
while the Archbishop sleeps here?

10:40.524 --> 10:44.080
Have you met the Lady Isabella,
Guy of Gisborne's sister?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.023
Enchanted.

10:49.843 --> 10:52.040
- I'm sure.
- Beware, Sheridan,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.360
she shares blood with an outlaw.

11:10.577 --> 11:11.827
Where do we hide?

11:11.947 --> 11:13.997
Get the lid on, get the lid on!

11:19.323 --> 11:20.520
This way. Come on!

11:30.241 --> 11:33.440
Set the bonfire in the clearing
over there.

11:33.601 --> 11:35.701
It's time to play dead, come on.

11:36.705 --> 11:38.009
Get this lid off.

11:38.129 --> 11:41.160
Come on, please. Do we have to?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.840
Unless you want to be put in one
yourself, I say yes. Now get it open!

11:45.141 --> 11:46.483
<i>Richard!</i>

11:47.948 --> 11:51.120
There's no time, you're going
to have to get in with me.

11:52.161 --> 11:53.779
<i>Oh, Richard.</i>

11:55.394 --> 11:57.618
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky!

11:59.441 --> 12:01.256
We've come back for you!

12:04.081 --> 12:05.731
Brother! There you are.

12:09.534 --> 12:12.784
You know, I think I prefer this one
to the real thing.

12:14.158 --> 12:17.439
At least this one doesn't lie
and double deal

12:19.249 --> 12:22.760
and steal his brother's place
on his father's throne.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.240
Or in his mother's heart.

12:28.441 --> 12:30.960
I've been in your shadow
too long, brother.

12:32.079 --> 12:34.529
It's my turn to step
into the light...

12:35.112 --> 12:37.400
while you will burn
in the pits of hell!

12:42.776 --> 12:44.826
Kate, that's the only evidence!

12:45.148 --> 12:46.800
It's too dangerous.

12:52.886 --> 12:54.136
It's all right,

12:54.878 --> 12:57.178
we have no further use for the body.

12:57.574 --> 13:00.080
The Archbishop has seen enough
of my brother's beauty

13:00.200 --> 13:02.080
to proclaim it to the world,
no doubt.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.640
Then we should proceed
with the plan forthwith.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.120
You're not having second thoughts,
are you, Sheridan?

13:08.633 --> 13:10.600
- Certainly not.
- You seem nervous.

13:13.537 --> 13:15.899
Guards! Take the coffin.

13:18.199 --> 13:20.911
If anybody asks where the body is,

13:21.141 --> 13:24.680
it's gone to London for a state funeral
at the Archbishop's request.

13:25.891 --> 13:29.080
By the time anybody finds out
that there is no body...

13:30.061 --> 13:31.661
... it'll be too late.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.752
What does Sheridan know
about Nottingham anyway?

13:39.801 --> 13:41.101
Stupid old fool.

13:42.024 --> 13:43.224
Hello, sister.

13:48.681 --> 13:50.280
Guy, please, please, just wait.

13:50.618 --> 13:52.547
For you to betray me again?!

13:52.667 --> 13:54.499
You got what you deserved.

13:57.722 --> 13:59.932
You'll get what you deserve.

14:01.723 --> 14:02.943
So kill me.

14:04.521 --> 14:06.640
You did as much to me
when I was a child anyway.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.484
Is that to be your dying thought?

14:09.743 --> 14:10.820
Yes.

14:11.561 --> 14:13.311
Go on, end it now

14:14.922 --> 14:17.122
and put us both out of our misery.

14:18.961 --> 14:20.080
Come on!

14:25.384 --> 14:26.720
What's wrong with you?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.880
Well, maybe we change things.

14:33.636 --> 14:35.200
King Richard is dead.

14:35.896 --> 14:37.760
Prince John is due to be crowned.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.840
- What?
- That's right, I can help you.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.448
- How can you help me?
- I can speak for you,

14:45.727 --> 14:47.400
but for that, you need me alive.

14:48.557 --> 14:49.799
<i>Kill me...</i>

14:49.960 --> 14:52.760
and you kill your last chance
back with the new King.

14:53.382 --> 14:54.582
Let me live...

14:55.521 --> 14:57.320
and we can both get what we want.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.720
We have to stop them
destroying that thing.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.320
How? There could be loads of them.

15:14.795 --> 15:16.160
We need a cloak.

15:27.297 --> 15:28.297
Good.

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
Good.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.094
Make sure you destroy everything.

15:33.214 --> 15:34.214
Yes, sir.

15:39.251 --> 15:41.800
- At least we'll be warm.
- Yeah!

15:43.876 --> 15:45.360
Yeah, I've had worse jobs.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.960
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.840
Quick, run!

16:05.680 --> 16:07.280
- Tuck.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.440
Ready?

16:09.884 --> 16:11.640
One, two, three.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.120
- We're too late!
- We can still tell the Archbishop,

16:23.281 --> 16:25.811
- tell him the truth.
- He already thinks he's seen the body.

16:25.931 --> 16:27.320
It's our word against theirs.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.512
We can't let the Prince
take power like this!

16:29.632 --> 16:32.120
We must stop him,
assassinate him if we have to.

16:32.280 --> 16:36.224
If we assassinate him, Tuck,
we risk invasion, civil war even!

16:37.467 --> 16:39.480
- But this is treason!
- I know,

16:40.005 --> 16:42.467
and I hate him as much as you do.
But while Richard's away,

16:42.587 --> 16:44.133
Prince John is our only leader.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.713
That's fine when he's Prince,
but when he's King he can make new laws,

16:47.833 --> 16:50.241
say and do what he wants,
spend what he wants.

16:50.361 --> 16:52.154
Then we stop him becoming King,
don't we?

16:52.274 --> 16:53.080
How?

16:55.631 --> 16:59.280
Well, for a coronation to take place,
you need a crown.

17:00.079 --> 17:01.129
Am I right?

17:02.160 --> 17:04.160
Well, then we steal his crown.

17:06.311 --> 17:10.012
How did you control yourself,
looking over it every single day?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.470
I am but a soldier, not a King.

17:14.395 --> 17:16.895
But with your help,
I will be one soon.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.119
Quick, quick, lock it away.
I don't trust myself.

17:21.968 --> 17:24.367
I shall wait
until the time is right.

17:25.901 --> 17:29.901
When all the world will see me shine
in the role to which I am destined.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.040
- How did you sleep?
- With one eye open.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.129
If we are going to work together,
we must learn to lower our guard.

17:49.681 --> 17:50.920
Looks painful.

17:51.454 --> 17:53.400
It's a scratch, I'll be fine.

17:53.691 --> 17:54.871
Here.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.480
So...

18:04.175 --> 18:07.275
how am I to get back
into the new King's favour?

18:08.188 --> 18:10.000
I have decided to speak
to him for you.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.360
On one condition.

18:14.117 --> 18:15.560
I need you to apologise.

18:16.510 --> 18:17.510
Apologise?

18:19.201 --> 18:20.992
- What for?
- You know what for.

18:21.112 --> 18:23.860
Isabella. Had I not
arranged your marriage

18:23.980 --> 18:26.257
we'd still live in some
God-forsaken corner of France

18:26.377 --> 18:29.360
- without a penny or acre to our name.
- Better that, than have been with him.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.520
NO! It is not my fault that you failed
to make the best of your chance.

18:34.566 --> 18:37.520
In fact it's down to me that we're still
in with a chance of anything.

18:37.811 --> 18:39.330
So instead of wasting time,

18:39.450 --> 18:43.450
I say we work out exactly what it is
you're going to say to the Prince.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.110
I was thinking...

18:46.975 --> 18:50.160
maybe I should just drug you
and hand you in to him myself.

18:50.321 --> 18:51.280
What?

18:51.975 --> 18:54.425
I was willing to forgive you,
brother,

18:54.931 --> 18:57.231
but you don't deserve my absolution.

19:00.121 --> 19:02.479
Oh, no, no. It's not your drink.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.000
It's your wound.

19:07.721 --> 19:09.771
Straight into your bloodstream.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.814
Concentrated valerian root.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.680
Enough to knock out a horse.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.380
I doubt Lord Sheridan
would've thought of that one.

19:29.921 --> 19:33.521
- Private room, sir?
- Another round for my drinking friends.

19:37.089 --> 19:38.703
Hello, Master.

19:44.281 --> 19:45.600
Robin of Locksley...

19:47.965 --> 19:50.240
I apologise for our surroundings,

19:50.401 --> 19:52.840
but I'm not really a favourite
with the guards.

19:53.001 --> 19:54.151
So it's true?

19:57.240 --> 19:59.880
I heard tell
of your feral existence.

20:00.342 --> 20:04.280
I thought it only right to raise
a toast... to our late King.

20:06.126 --> 20:10.113
I know you would've been as...
distraught as I was with the news.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.566
Indeed.

20:12.231 --> 20:14.795
But we must look to the future.

20:19.357 --> 20:21.760
You're not going to cause
me any problems, are you?

20:22.264 --> 20:23.320
What do you mean?

20:23.731 --> 20:27.231
I also hear that you've been
making trouble for the Prince.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.629
And as the new Sheriff of Nottingham

20:32.427 --> 20:34.377
I can't allow that to happen.

20:34.497 --> 20:37.480
So, you are to be
the new Sheriff, are you?

20:39.246 --> 20:41.560
And a very strict one at that!

20:45.881 --> 20:47.431
All work and no play?

20:48.298 --> 20:51.680
That doesn't sound like Lord Sheridan,
the great Keeper of the Crown to me.

20:52.188 --> 20:55.659
The Crown is surrounded by outlaws,

20:56.799 --> 20:59.321
where outlaws fear to tread.

21:01.631 --> 21:04.158
Well, if you're happy
with the Prince then...

21:04.278 --> 21:06.440
what problems can I possibly have?

21:06.560 --> 21:07.800
To King John.

21:11.027 --> 21:14.800
So, is this a private party,
or can anyone join in?

21:14.961 --> 21:16.440
I told you to wait outside!

21:16.601 --> 21:18.164
We're talking in here!

21:18.284 --> 21:21.534
- I'm sorry about this, I apologise.
- No, no, please,

21:21.924 --> 21:23.800
please... Service!

21:24.394 --> 21:25.400
Sir?

21:25.860 --> 21:26.860
Mead.

21:27.154 --> 21:30.159
You will make me tipsy.

21:30.279 --> 21:31.879
Kate, this is private.

21:33.582 --> 21:35.680
I told you to wait outside.

21:37.819 --> 21:39.569
You're wet, Locksley.

21:40.314 --> 21:42.960
I'll go and clear this up.
I'll be back.

21:43.362 --> 21:44.719
Well, delicious.

21:44.881 --> 21:46.600
Why, thank you.

21:48.795 --> 21:50.195
I could eat you...

21:51.642 --> 21:53.600
Roses, mate, for the coronation.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.831
Thanks very much.

22:12.150 --> 22:14.800
Now, I want the theme
of my coronation to be

22:14.920 --> 22:17.720
"out of the darkness
into the light."

22:18.010 --> 22:21.080
And I want all the guards
with mirrored shields,

22:21.281 --> 22:24.160
to reflect the glory of my leadership
far and wide.

22:24.491 --> 22:28.084
I wonder if this opulence is appropriate
while people starve?

22:28.204 --> 22:30.920
Well, I'm giving them
something to aspire to, Archbishop.

22:31.936 --> 22:34.249
All right, very well.
I'll compromise,

22:34.369 --> 22:36.772
I'll use rubies instead of diamonds.

22:43.342 --> 22:46.229
Good to see he's got his finger
on the big political issues of the day.

22:46.349 --> 22:49.520
If you were Sheridan,
where would you hide the crown?

22:49.998 --> 22:52.400
- Well, you know him better than I do.
- Apparently not.

22:52.561 --> 22:55.910
- Come on, Robin. Trust yourself.
- What did he say?

22:57.884 --> 22:59.661
"Surrounded by outlaws

23:01.120 --> 23:02.991
"where outlaws fear to tread".

23:04.249 --> 23:05.680
It's the dungeons!

23:08.961 --> 23:09.966
Here.

23:20.005 --> 23:21.200
Pick up his keys.

23:40.716 --> 23:41.725
Hang on.

23:44.226 --> 23:45.240
Sorry, mate.

23:49.021 --> 23:50.306
- Ready?
- Yeah.

23:55.087 --> 23:58.427
This is gonna take us a bit longer
than we thought, isn't it?

23:59.720 --> 24:00.720
Another!

24:00.840 --> 24:04.240
No, I must go and help
with the preparation for the coronation.

24:04.441 --> 24:06.395
- No!
- Where's Robin?

24:06.761 --> 24:08.429
I'll only let you go

24:08.755 --> 24:11.840
if you beat me at arm wrestling.

24:14.641 --> 24:17.040
Oh, come on, look at those muscles.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.080
Don't you think
you could beat someone my size?

24:21.480 --> 24:24.896
Well, if you insist.

24:33.721 --> 24:35.760
Hey! Hey! Get off her!

24:35.880 --> 24:37.799
- Unhand me!
- Allan?!

24:37.919 --> 24:40.080
A plan's a plan, Kate,
it's gone too far.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.921
Plan? What plan?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.520
My keys! Locksley!

24:47.521 --> 24:48.601
Let's go!

26:02.095 --> 26:03.670
Robin! Come on, hurry!

26:13.281 --> 26:16.400
- Careful!
- Thanks!

26:51.050 --> 26:52.211
Hallelujah!

27:02.201 --> 27:03.920
The crown! Stop him!

27:17.117 --> 27:18.125
Hood!

27:19.383 --> 27:22.104
There can be no coronation
without the crown.

27:22.224 --> 27:25.760
I'm sure another can be made
if needs be. I know the design by heart.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.840
That crown was made for the coronation
of Edward the Confessor.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.440
It cannot be replaced.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.526
Sheridan!

27:34.646 --> 27:37.680
Locksley was a former student of mine,
I can get it back.

27:37.909 --> 27:40.219
What are you waiting for,
you stupid old fool?

27:40.339 --> 27:43.080
Get me back my crown before
the coronation or I'll have your head!

27:44.744 --> 27:46.656
Sire, I have some
very good news for you.

27:46.776 --> 27:48.360
Someone better had.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.694
- I never did get what you saw in her.
- No.

27:58.292 --> 28:02.292
Right, chaps...
you can let yourselves out.

28:02.610 --> 28:04.286
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

28:06.327 --> 28:08.840
- Kate...
- If Robin gets caught, it's your fault.

28:09.136 --> 28:11.960
- I thought you were in danger.
- I had everything under control!

28:12.121 --> 28:13.440
They're here!

28:16.694 --> 28:18.440
- Well?
- We got the crown.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.022
But... they followed us with dogs.

28:24.719 --> 28:26.830
I have to get a horse
from Nettlestone

28:26.950 --> 28:28.897
- and get this crown to London.
- London?!

28:29.017 --> 28:32.317
The King may still have
supporters there. I'll be back.

28:32.761 --> 28:35.266
- We'll take care of the guards.
- Good luck.

28:38.475 --> 28:40.800
I coated the crown
with a special scent.

28:42.043 --> 28:43.064
Sheridan!

28:46.730 --> 28:48.587
- More mead, sir?
- Follow the bag!

28:48.707 --> 28:50.200
- Which one?
- Both.

28:50.724 --> 28:53.138
- Is this what you're looking for?
- There's another one.

28:53.258 --> 28:54.525
Oi! Old man!

28:55.721 --> 28:56.880
Arrest them all!

29:28.501 --> 29:30.120
The crown! The crown!

29:41.564 --> 29:44.778
- Vermin!
- Where's the crown?

29:45.330 --> 29:46.452
What crown?

29:47.754 --> 29:50.086
- Get your hands off me!
- Sheridan?

29:52.053 --> 29:54.867
- Give me the crown or the wench'll die.
- Wench?!

29:58.681 --> 29:59.840
Oh, dogs! Er...

30:00.041 --> 30:01.776
- Keep moving!
- No!

30:02.768 --> 30:03.928
It's here!

30:06.921 --> 30:08.200
Wait! The dogs...

30:10.183 --> 30:12.280
- Run for it!
- Grab a dock leaf!

30:13.761 --> 30:15.600
Leave them, we need Hood!

30:18.359 --> 30:21.209
Let the dogs go,
they're picking up the scent.

30:23.536 --> 30:27.507
I wanted to give you
a personal coronation gift from me.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.426
So you bring me to your bed chamber?

30:30.576 --> 30:32.279
I give you my brother,

30:32.710 --> 30:34.206
Guy of Gisborne!

30:37.884 --> 30:39.200
- Guy!
- Get back!

30:39.361 --> 30:40.361
Guards!

30:41.321 --> 30:44.480
Get in the corner!
Look what you've done to me, Isabella.

30:45.155 --> 30:47.008
You betrayed me, both of you!

30:51.040 --> 30:53.080
- Are you all right?
- Guards, arrest her!

30:53.200 --> 30:55.520
If I'm disfigured
for my coronation...

30:55.986 --> 30:56.995
Sire!

31:07.201 --> 31:08.209
Idiots.

31:21.517 --> 31:24.040
- You taught them well.
- Better than you.

31:29.001 --> 31:31.800
You taught me to love the King.
Not lie about him.

31:32.674 --> 31:34.800
I gave the King
the best years of my life.

31:35.146 --> 31:37.440
And d'you know
what he gave me in return?

31:42.120 --> 31:44.800
Retirement!
Too old to train his knights

31:45.504 --> 31:48.818
and good for nothing
but looking after his jewellery!

31:52.184 --> 31:55.086
He entrusted you with the crown
because he loved you!

31:55.206 --> 31:57.727
Then why didn't he keep me
by his side?!

32:05.454 --> 32:07.471
Is that the blow of an old man?

32:11.974 --> 32:13.865
So that's what this is about, is it?

32:13.985 --> 32:17.640
You gave up on your country
for your vanity, for your ego?

32:17.942 --> 32:21.000
If the King cared about the country
he'd be here... but he isn't!

32:24.677 --> 32:27.360
Your time is past, old master.

32:28.345 --> 32:29.760
It still is my time.

32:34.610 --> 32:35.620
Leave him,

32:36.170 --> 32:37.200
he's mine.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.960
Just like the crown.

32:41.531 --> 32:44.719
Out of respect for a good student,

32:44.881 --> 32:47.680
I will not kill you.
But you shall never see England again.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.000
Take him to Hull
and put him on a boat.

32:51.435 --> 32:52.443
One way.

32:53.081 --> 32:54.514
Farewell, Locksley.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.799
Send extra search parties
to the forest around Locksley.

33:00.961 --> 33:02.533
I want Gisborne dead!

33:02.653 --> 33:05.367
Sire, I want the same as you,
please.

33:05.487 --> 33:08.342
- Just give me another chance.
- Too late, you've had your chances.

33:08.462 --> 33:10.040
Welcome to your new home!

33:10.160 --> 33:12.834
Sire, please.
Anyone can make a mistake.

33:13.587 --> 33:15.566
Look at Lord Sheridan for example.

33:16.145 --> 33:17.600
Oh, Sheridan...

33:18.918 --> 33:22.523
Sheridan, how could I have ever
doubted your recovery?

33:23.067 --> 33:24.441
Your highness.

33:26.158 --> 33:28.240
- Lady Isabella.
- Pay her no heed.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.981
She's a prisoner of state
for aiding and abetting

33:31.101 --> 33:33.925
her terrorist brother Gisborne
in the attempted assassination

33:34.045 --> 33:36.295
of the new King of England.

33:37.438 --> 33:38.912
A serious crime.

33:39.536 --> 33:43.406
For which she will be punished
as seriously as you shall be rewarded.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.354
Perhaps she merely requires
the firm hand of a man

33:47.474 --> 33:50.208
to encourage her to mend her ways.

33:50.328 --> 33:54.042
But where would I find such a man
willing to martyr himself?

33:54.610 --> 33:57.800
- Always at your service, your highness.
- She's all yours.

33:58.894 --> 34:01.120
- Please, sire.
- Or she'll rot alone down here.

34:07.041 --> 34:10.878
And I took the liberty
of dealing with Robin Hood.

34:11.161 --> 34:12.755
I hope you don't mind.

34:13.648 --> 34:16.320
You'll make a fine
Sheriff of Nottingham, Sheridan.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.791
The stable boy says
the horses are all accounted for.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.800
- Robin couldn't have made it.
- You should've kept moving, Much.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.991
- He had a knife in your side!
- She can take care of herself.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.100
Oh, right, so that's why
you stepped in in the tavern?

34:34.219 --> 34:36.716
- Right.
- I did cos I was worried about her.

34:36.835 --> 34:38.880
- You did cos you were showing off.
- What?!

34:39.569 --> 34:41.330
I did what I did because I care!

34:41.449 --> 34:43.545
- I care!
- You care about yourself.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.754
- Is that right?
- Yes!

34:46.527 --> 34:50.359
Robin could be dead and you're
squabbling like a couple of schoolboys!

34:50.934 --> 34:53.460
- Put them out of their misery.
- He's right.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.920
I'm sick of you two
trying to protect me.

34:58.839 --> 35:01.040
We've got to keep our minds
on the mission.

35:01.351 --> 35:04.240
Right. If Robin didn't make it,
then Sheridan has the crown.

35:04.562 --> 35:07.360
If Sheridan has the crown,
Prince John can have his coronation.

35:07.521 --> 35:10.040
- We can't let that happen.
- What about Robin?

35:17.606 --> 35:18.627
Shut up!

35:26.040 --> 35:27.089
Stop!

36:01.979 --> 36:05.080
Wakey wakey, Archbishop,
no rest for the wicked!

36:05.281 --> 36:08.040
You've got a coronation to attend!
Mine!

36:10.680 --> 36:13.892
All mine.
And no-one to stop me.

36:16.434 --> 36:20.190
These are the Abbey doors.
We need to go in here, here and here.

36:20.740 --> 36:23.779
And storm the altar.
First one to the crown makes it out,

36:23.899 --> 36:26.337
the rest of us
deal with the consequences.

36:26.457 --> 36:27.840
He might have the crown,

36:27.960 --> 36:30.737
but he's not King until that crown
makes it onto his head.

36:30.857 --> 36:34.320
Good. But doesn't "storm" imply
that there's more than five of us?

36:35.072 --> 36:36.484
How about six?

36:36.964 --> 36:38.186
- Hey!
- Robin!

36:41.747 --> 36:44.154
Please tell us you've got
a better plan than this one.

36:44.274 --> 36:45.760
I have, actually.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.080
We're going to need shields.

36:48.836 --> 36:51.400
Just like the ones
Prince John wanted for his guards.

36:52.496 --> 36:54.450
It's going to be blinding, Allan.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.720
Do you love me?

37:08.428 --> 37:09.440
Smile...

37:09.858 --> 37:13.148
I said... do you love me?

37:59.927 --> 38:03.841
As kings, priests and prophets
were anointed,

38:04.332 --> 38:06.160
and as Solomon was anointed king

38:07.262 --> 38:08.795
by Zadok the priest,

38:09.232 --> 38:10.291
so be thou

38:11.629 --> 38:12.650
anointed.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.132
The sovereign sceptre

38:15.481 --> 38:16.755
to do justice,

38:17.419 --> 38:20.029
and stop the growth of iniquity.

38:22.602 --> 38:24.492
The robe of righteousness

38:25.201 --> 38:27.360
and the garment of salvation,

38:29.320 --> 38:31.147
the crown of the faithful.

38:32.355 --> 38:35.079
Bless, we beseech Thee, this crown,

38:35.572 --> 38:38.773
and so sanctify Thy servant, John.

38:43.281 --> 38:44.281
<i>Halt!</i>

38:45.968 --> 38:48.000
<i>I am King Richard!</i>

38:48.729 --> 38:52.320
<i>King of the English,
Duke of the Normans and Aquitanians.</i>

38:52.908 --> 38:56.120
- You should be in the Holy Land!
<i>- The waxwork lives.</i>

38:59.987 --> 39:01.729
What is the meaning of this?

39:01.849 --> 39:04.520
It was the Prince's doing,
Your Worship.

39:04.721 --> 39:06.448
He ordered a model made of the King,

39:06.568 --> 39:09.200
- so he could lie about his death.
- I'm sorry, sire.

39:09.361 --> 39:11.120
Shut up, you stupid old fool.

39:11.281 --> 39:15.120
- We will finish this coronation!
- Impossible, this is treason!

39:15.321 --> 39:16.800
I will be King!

39:21.960 --> 39:22.840
Hood?!

39:27.765 --> 39:29.640
You impersonate the King?!

39:30.018 --> 39:31.440
Just like you,

39:31.771 --> 39:32.960
Prince John.

39:33.161 --> 39:36.400
- Arrest him!
- You can do what you want.

39:36.839 --> 39:39.375
These people... they know the truth.

39:39.560 --> 39:43.205
And so do I.
I will never make you King.

39:44.608 --> 39:45.880
Where's my crown?

39:47.012 --> 39:49.000
Is this what you're looking for?

39:52.840 --> 39:55.731
How about... a state funeral?

39:56.861 --> 39:57.915
Gisborne,

39:58.913 --> 40:00.160
don't do it.

40:02.361 --> 40:05.560
I know he deserves it,
but with no leader at home,

40:05.936 --> 40:09.440
England could be ripped apart,
torn up by war...

40:09.951 --> 40:12.771
- What has England ever done for me?
- Brother...

40:12.909 --> 40:15.692
Don't think I won't shoot you, as well,
after everything you've done.

40:15.812 --> 40:16.845
I know,

40:19.609 --> 40:22.626
but you'll have to decide
which one of us you want dead the most.

40:22.746 --> 40:24.309
Prince John or me.

40:25.121 --> 40:28.331
Because as much as I hate Robin Hood,
he loves his country.

40:29.416 --> 40:31.960
And he won't give you a second shot.

40:47.481 --> 40:48.701
Arrest him!

40:55.673 --> 40:56.675
Stop!

40:56.795 --> 40:59.120
Anyone who draws blood
in the house of God

40:59.281 --> 41:01.360
will be damned for all eternity.

41:33.290 --> 41:36.520
If God had wanted you to have the crown,
He'd have given it to you.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.600
- Robin! I've got it, I've got it!
- Come on!

41:50.394 --> 41:53.211
- Quick! Stop them!
- Let them go!

42:02.640 --> 42:03.640
Fragile!

42:06.742 --> 42:09.654
This is what happens
when you employ incompetents.

42:11.310 --> 42:14.120
I trust you will not make
the same mistake, Sheriff.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.742
Fear not, sire.
By the time you return,

42:18.862 --> 42:21.480
I intend to have Robin Hood in shackles
alongside my brother.

42:25.118 --> 42:26.341
Or coffins.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.289
That's far enough.

42:37.579 --> 42:39.369
What is the meaning of this?

42:55.315 --> 42:56.324
Stand.

42:57.681 --> 43:00.679
You know...
I think this is the first time

43:00.799 --> 43:03.800
we've ever stopped a carriage
to give gold back.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.542
Thank you, Robin Hood.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.391
England owes you
a debt of gratitude.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.480
Just make sure Prince John pays it.

43:31.578 --> 43:34.640
Trouble, Isabella?
You haven't seen anything yet.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.240
Don't come any closer.

43:36.596 --> 43:38.960
I'm your new Sheriff.
Thornton at your service.

43:39.537 --> 43:42.379
No-one actually seems sorry
that you're on your way out, do they?

43:42.499 --> 43:44.572
If I am to die then so be it.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.680
I know where gold coins are buried!
Handfuls and handfuls!

43:47.840 --> 43:49.479
- Where?
- Burial mound.

43:49.645 --> 43:51.998
They place curses on horses heads
to ward off intruders.

43:52.118 --> 43:53.880
You have disturbed the dead!

43:54.342 --> 43:56.120
I'm afraid I want to be awful.

43:56.281 --> 43:58.560
Then find out what it is
to be my enemy.
