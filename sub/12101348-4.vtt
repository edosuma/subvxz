[dance music playing]

00:14.889 --> 00:16.474
[indistinct chattering]

00:42.959 --> 00:44.294
[both grunting]

00:44.961 --> 00:47.756
Hey, you wanna watch
where you're thrusting there, Travolta?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.132
Travolta?

00:49.841 --> 00:53.762
Wow! You're digging deep in the classics.
I love it. I give you points for it.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.890
[laughs] We're giving points? Okay.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.310
Uh, minus 20 for being a shit dancer.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.227
Ooh!

01:02.062 --> 01:05.482
Nick. Just so you know
who you're insulting.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.025
Hey, Nick.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.487
I'm guessing you already know who I am.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.905
Why? Are you somebody?

01:12.405 --> 01:14.491
Come on, of course
I know who you are. You're…

01:14.574 --> 01:18.161
Like, everyone in the world knows
who you are. Let me ask you something.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.039
When did you decide
to say screw it to being a hero?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.085
What?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.962
I mean, look at you. You're the daughter
of the Utopian and Lady Liberty,

01:28.046 --> 01:32.509
and you're doing your own thing. I mean,
was it hard to turn your back on all that?

01:33.426 --> 01:34.928
Why are you asking me that?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.972
-[Nick] 'Cause I wanna know.
-[scoffs]

01:38.890 --> 01:43.269
Sorry, it's just most people,
they wanna talk about my mom or my dad.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.606
Dudes especially have a real hard-on
for my mom.

01:47.732 --> 01:51.027
Yeah, well, I'm not trying
to get into your mom's pants…

01:52.070 --> 01:53.154
or your dad's.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.365
[chuckles]

01:57.700 --> 01:58.618
Good to know.

02:00.370 --> 02:04.457
Chloe? Chloe! Oh my God! [laughing]

02:05.875 --> 02:08.628
Janna, what are you doing here?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.088
Are you kidding? I love this place.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.215
-Hi! Janna.
-Nick.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.343
Hey, you guys gotta come over.
We have a table.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.595
Wait. You… you've got a table?

02:17.679 --> 02:21.099
Well, Ruby did.
We're celebrating. I got into the Union!

02:21.182 --> 02:24.144
[Nick] What? Congrats! That's awesome!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.771
Yeah, I know how much you wanted that.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.235
-You gotta come over and say hi.
-No, no, no. It's okay. I…

02:32.318 --> 02:33.528
[Janna] Come on!

02:33.611 --> 02:35.780
[in singsong] We got bottle service.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.370
-Is she always like that?
-Eleven is her lowest setting.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.956
Wait. Janna?
Like, is that Janna Croft, Ghost Beam?

02:45.039 --> 02:46.708
You got a thing for capes and goofy names?

02:46.791 --> 02:48.084
I thought she was your friend.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.128
Yeah, when we were kids.
I grew up. She didn't.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.173
Wait. All right. New plan.

02:54.048 --> 02:58.261
We're gonna drink all their shit
and then take off without chipping in.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.640
[dance music continues]

03:02.724 --> 03:03.725
[chuckles]

03:10.857 --> 03:12.066
-[Ruby snorting]
-Ruby!

03:12.692 --> 03:14.319
What are you doing?

03:14.402 --> 03:15.486
[all chuckling]

03:15.570 --> 03:17.697
The hall monitor's back.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.157
[all laughing]

03:19.240 --> 03:20.658
Come on, guys. It's her night.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.912
We're supposed to be setting an example,
in and out of uniform.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.997
[Chloe] Oh, you sound worse than my dad.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.750
Well, look who it is.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.836
-Hey, guys. I'm Nick.
-This is Nick.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.214
Hey, Nick. Ruby.

03:34.297 --> 03:39.802
I know. Ruby, Jay, Austin, Kaitlyn.
You… you guys are awesome.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.721
Ah, shit! We've got a groupie.

03:41.804 --> 03:42.847
[all laughing]

03:42.931 --> 03:45.266
I'd offer you some,
but this is the last of it.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.644
Oh, well, then you bitches
are lucky I showed up.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.062
[all gasping]

03:49.854 --> 03:51.314
Chloe, put that away!

03:51.397 --> 03:55.318
[snorts] Uh, can you relax
for, like, five seconds?

03:55.401 --> 03:59.030
What if a mine caves in
or another Blackstar comes out of nowhere?

03:59.113 --> 04:00.782
We could get the call anytime.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.785
That's what the geriatrics are for,
Sugar and Spice.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.039
-Are you really gonna call me that?
-That was her nickname in fifth grade.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.583
So, you guys all go back that far?

04:10.667 --> 04:14.587
Everybody's powers had already kicked in,
and I was a late bloomer.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.049
Chloe's the one that made sure
no one messed with me until I got mine.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.385
[Ruby] Those were the days, huh?

04:20.468 --> 04:23.471
-Back when you actually gave a shit.
-Ruby!

04:24.097 --> 04:27.100
You got a bug up your ass, pull it out.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.146
-[Ruby] Why weren't you at the funeral…
-[snorts]

04:32.230 --> 04:35.024
[Ruby] …you know,
the one for all of our friends?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.986
Too busy showing your ass
on some magazine cover?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.363
[woman] Forget about the funeral.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.327
Where were you when our friends
were getting ripped apart?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.998
What were you doing when I was getting
my goddamn teeth knocked out?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.125
[Chloe] Uh…

04:52.709 --> 04:56.254
Not getting mine knocked out,
like a complete fool.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.173
Say that again, bitch.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.218
Yo, Chloe… Whoa.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.054
-Guys, we should just all calm down.
-[Nick] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.475
You wanna keep the rest of those teeth?

05:09.976 --> 05:10.810
[chuckles]

05:11.728 --> 05:12.562
Hmm?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.441
Back off, Sierra.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.278
-Ooh! [chuckles] Oh, shit!
-Guys, come on! We're all friends!

05:20.361 --> 05:25.992
Chloe doesn't have any friends,
because she's an asshole and a coward.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.368
[yells]

05:30.413 --> 05:32.248
[panting]

05:35.460 --> 05:37.545
[yelling]

05:45.928 --> 05:47.513
You got powers?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.516
Yeah. I thought you knew.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.394
I'm Nick. You know, Nick of Time?

05:53.978 --> 05:57.106
Oh my God. That is so bad.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.735
[chuckles] Yeah, well, I… I…
I'm working on that name, but, uh…

06:01.736 --> 06:03.946
Look, I can't hold
this many people for long.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.659
Why don't we take this party
someplace else? What do you say?

06:10.161 --> 06:11.788
Boring as shit, anyway.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.254
[dramatic music playing]

07:04.173 --> 07:05.550
[wind gusting]

07:06.050 --> 07:07.844
[children chattering indistinctly]

07:11.264 --> 07:12.348
[panting]

07:12.432 --> 07:13.558
[children giggling]

07:15.351 --> 07:16.269
[man grunts]

07:29.031 --> 07:29.949
[whispers] John.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.288
-[John] Get in the car.
-[woman] John…

07:36.372 --> 07:38.791
[John] Go on. Keep the little ones quiet.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.261
You looking for a handout,
we got none to give, mister.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.140
You looking for more…
I'm gonna take issue.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.227
I'm not looking for trouble.
I just wanna pass through.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.983
That's the same story
the last asshole spun me…

08:05.067 --> 08:07.320
before he tried
to part my hair the hard way

08:07.403 --> 08:09.197
and help himself to my vehicle.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.285
Use that thing to straighten him out?

08:14.368 --> 08:15.828
You guessed right.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.289
Now, state your purpose,
or you get them feet working.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.584
I'm not looking
to do you or yours any wrong.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.963
I'm just looking for directions
if… if you can spare them.

08:32.428 --> 08:37.308
I tell you what. You help me change
this goddamn tire, I'll oblige best I can.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.774
[grunts, panting]

08:45.358 --> 08:48.903
So, what you doing way out here…
if you don't mind me asking?

08:48.986 --> 08:49.904
Oh…

08:50.696 --> 08:52.990
Like I said, I'm looking for directions.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.493
You wouldn't happen to have seen…

08:57.912 --> 08:58.871
this place?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.249
[John] What, a windmill?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.793
[chuckles] Shit, you throw a rock
with your eyes closed,

09:03.876 --> 09:05.127
you're likely to hit one.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.881
No. No, this windmill's got
three blades missing.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.385
-You see that?
-No, can't say as I've seen it.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.137
Emma?

09:16.347 --> 09:19.809
You, uh… you recall seeing
anything like this here?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.399
[Emma] Can't rightly say. Sorry, mister.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.277
Uh, we came from the east,
out of Missouri.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.738
I mean, it might be further west, maybe.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.241
-[Chester] Or maybe it's all in your head.
-[gasps]

09:35.324 --> 09:38.411
Maybe you really are crazy,
like Walt's been saying.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.497
[ominous music playing]

09:42.081 --> 09:43.374
[Emma] You okay, mister?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.877
[Sheldon panting]

09:49.547 --> 09:50.381
Yeah.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.010
[grunting]

09:56.887 --> 10:02.018
You got a family back where you're from,
a wife, kids you should be looking after?

10:03.519 --> 10:05.396
Yeah, I got a… a brother.

10:07.481 --> 10:11.193
I had a gal
that I was, uh, supposed to marry,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.613
but that was before things went sideways.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.905
[children giggling]

10:15.448 --> 10:17.116
I don't mean to speak out of turn,

10:17.199 --> 10:19.452
but, uh, maybe
you ought to get back to 'em.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.664
Folks like that, they provide a comfort.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.667
Keep you upright,

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
you know, when all you want to do is…

10:30.254 --> 10:32.548
is lay down, call the fight.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.301
Yeah, maybe.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.516
[sighs]

10:44.101 --> 10:45.102
Maybe.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.361
[airplane engines whooshing]

10:53.444 --> 10:55.529
[Chloe laughing]

10:57.239 --> 10:59.200
[chuckles]

10:59.283 --> 11:00.993
Hmm. [grunts]

11:01.077 --> 11:04.580
Ectoplex? I mean, come on,
what kind of name is that, right?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.832
Sounds like something
that goes wrong with your uterus.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.334
She thinks she's better than me

11:08.417 --> 11:12.797
'cause she wears a silly uniform
like all the other flying sheep.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.632
[Nick] Yeah, Sierra's a bitch.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.592
Don't let her get to you.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.428
[Chloe] She ain't getting shit.
You want a line?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.305
[Nick] Hell, yeah.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.432
[Chloe] Ladies first.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.726
You got a nice place.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.103
[exhales]

11:27.186 --> 11:28.771
[snorting]

11:30.981 --> 11:31.816
Did you go?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.819
-Where?
-To the funeral?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.907
I didn't know anybody.
It didn't feel right.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.160
Do you think I should have gone?

11:44.036 --> 11:44.870
[scoffs]

11:46.330 --> 11:51.043
Look, pretending to give a shit
is worse than not showing up.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.755
Yeah, but, like…

11:55.756 --> 11:57.049
they were my friends, or…

11:58.259 --> 12:02.722
at least they used to be. Like, shouldn't…
shouldn't I want to give a shit?

12:14.150 --> 12:14.984
[Nick] Chloe…

12:16.819 --> 12:20.197
this is your life, you know?

12:22.158 --> 12:25.703
And in it, you gotta do what feels right.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.998
You do.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.501
Not something other people
just think you should be doing.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.846
[grunts]

12:43.929 --> 12:45.181
[both panting]

12:52.855 --> 12:54.023

-[gasping]

13:06.786 --> 13:07.620
[chuckles]

13:11.081 --> 13:13.209
[panting]

13:13.292 --> 13:14.460
[vibrating]

13:16.962 --> 13:17.880
[grunts]

13:20.216 --> 13:21.967
[sighs] Hello?

13:22.051 --> 13:25.304
[man] Where are you? You were supposed
to be at the shoot an hour ago.

13:25.387 --> 13:29.433
Shit! I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm… I'm… I'm on my way. [sighs]

13:31.060 --> 13:32.937
Hey! Hey! You gotta go.

13:34.104 --> 13:34.980
What?

13:35.523 --> 13:38.234
No. I wanna make you breakfast.
I'm amazing with--

13:38.317 --> 13:40.152
[Chloe] No, no. I'm late for work. Out.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.780
-[Nick] You don't have to tell me twice.
-Yeah, I just did.

13:44.406 --> 13:48.994
Hey, so, uh… what do you think
about Speed Ramp for my new name?

13:49.703 --> 13:50.788
Like the freeway?

13:50.871 --> 13:53.707
[laughs] No, that's an on-ramp. Uh…

13:53.791 --> 13:55.084
What about Time Warp?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.419
Why do you care
about some stupid made-up name?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.754
What's wrong with just Nick?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.966
Well, I need it for the application.
I'm applying to the Union of Justice.

14:06.595 --> 14:07.680
You're what?

14:07.763 --> 14:09.557
[Nick] I'm applying to the Union.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.518
I mean, I'm actually reapplying.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.477
Uh…

14:15.646 --> 14:17.690
Look, I know it's not your thing.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.942
And I… I don't want you to think that…

14:21.652 --> 14:24.321
I… I'm just trying
to be honest here with you.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.491
I wasn't even gonna bring this up,
but I'd kick myself if I didn't.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.369
-Look, you being who you are and all--
-Yeah, just say it.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.124
I was hoping
maybe you could put in a word for me.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.961

31:29.345 --> 31:33.433
Taft had just taken the White House.
We shipped out three days later.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.605
-So you… you were in the Army?
-[farmer] Navy.

31:40.231 --> 31:43.735
Storekeeper, Second Class.

31:45.278 --> 31:50.575
Wound up on the USS Shetland,
Smith-class destroyer.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.827
Called 'em flivvers back then.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.915
The Shetland

31:57.916 --> 31:59.959
was the first destroyer

32:00.043 --> 32:03.838
that could make a go of it
on the open sea. [grunts]

32:05.048 --> 32:06.049
[chuckles]

32:06.841 --> 32:09.260
Or that's what everybody thought.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.846
[chuckling]

32:12.555 --> 32:13.681
So, what happened?

32:15.892 --> 32:19.228
That goddamn thing came out of nowhere.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.900
[sighs] One minute…

32:25.485 --> 32:26.736
the sea was…

32:28.446 --> 32:32.909
clear, glassy, like a mirror.

32:35.203 --> 32:39.248
The next minute,
I looked up, and it was on us.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.917
[wind howling]

32:41.000 --> 32:43.920
Oh, the wind came up something awful.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.297
Waves like I'd never seen.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.007
[waves crashing]

32:48.841 --> 32:51.970
We tried to go around it
next three, four days.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.431
But iffen we turned, it turned.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.477
It was like it knew what we were doing.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.190
Like it… like it was alive.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.612
And then, all of a sudden…

33:11.114 --> 33:13.199
the world went upside down.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.329
Broke my collarbone, my leg…

33:20.123 --> 33:21.165
bunch of ribs.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.918
I got this doozy on my head.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.005
[ringing sharply]

33:27.088 --> 33:30.091
And I heard this ringing
off and on ever since.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.594
You hear that? The ringing?

33:35.638 --> 33:36.472
No.

33:41.728 --> 33:45.273
You ain't been out there yet, then,
have you?

33:45.857 --> 33:46.774
Out where?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.235
Out where the sea comes alive!

33:49.318 --> 33:51.487
-[waves crashing]
-Ain't you been listening?

33:54.157 --> 33:56.117
I never went to sea again.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.494
But…

34:00.496 --> 34:03.708
it found me, even after all these years.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.547
The water always finds you.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.595
It makes these patterns.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.098
Around.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.269
Around.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.355
Told you there ain't nothing out here.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.859
Just a crazy old fool
with a finger on the trigger.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.614
[panting]

34:36.741 --> 34:38.201
Was it somebody close?

34:40.369 --> 34:42.705
-What?
-[farmer] Whoever was talking to you.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.708
It's always somebody close.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.753
-[panting]
-[farmer] Don't listen to 'em, boy.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.880
They'll lie to you.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.133
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!
-[gun fires]

34:54.217 --> 34:56.052

35:54.652 --> 35:55.778
[Kaitlyn laughs]

35:55.862 --> 35:57.488
[indistinct chattering]

35:59.699 --> 36:00.950
Got to be kidding me.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.202
[dance music playing]

36:03.286 --> 36:05.288
Hey! The hell do you think you're doing?

36:05.371 --> 36:08.124
[sighs] The hell does it look like, Carl?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.251
I'm having a party.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.838
Mmm. You put a goddamn hole in my wall!

36:14.839 --> 36:18.301
Eh… You got my notice on the door,
I see, huh?

36:18.384 --> 36:21.470
I want you out now.
You're trespassing, all of you!

36:21.554 --> 36:23.264
Yo, who is this asshole?

36:23.347 --> 36:25.933
I'm the asshole that owns the building,
you little shit.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.518
[laughing]

36:29.812 --> 36:31.981
All right, everybody out.
You, let's go now.

36:32.064 --> 36:35.818
[laughing] Kaitlyn? Kaitlyn, you mind?

36:36.652 --> 36:37.570
[chuckles]

36:48.873 --> 36:51.751
-[chuckles]
-See? All better.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.880
Now, get out of my apartment,

36:55.963 --> 36:59.634
or I'll have her reverse something on you.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.469
[partygoers oohing]

37:01.552 --> 37:02.929
[feigns snarl]

37:03.012 --> 37:04.263
[partygoers laughing]

37:06.140 --> 37:09.560
That's hilarious. You're very funny.
You're very funny. Thank you. Uh, just…

37:09.644 --> 37:13.689
Okay, just keep it down.
People are trying to sleep.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.066

37:15.149 --> 37:17.568

37:19.237 --> 37:21.280
-[Chloe] Lay some more lines out, bitch!
-Whoo!

37:21.364 --> 37:22.865
[Chloe] We're just getting started!

Forty-seven. Sixteen.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.994
[Janna sighs] Okay.
Let's get you cleaned up.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.249
Get away from me. You're not my mother.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.084
Look, I'm just trying to help.

You wanna be her.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.593
But you can't.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.929
You're just you.

Okay? I think
it'll really make you feel better.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.488
[sighs] Why are you here, Janna?

41:33.115 --> 41:34.325
Because I'm your friend.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.202
No, you aren't.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.120
[Janna] Chloe…

41:38.204 --> 41:41.248
I don't have friends…

41:44.627 --> 41:46.045
because I'm an asshole.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.632
That's what
all of you really think, right?

41:49.715 --> 41:50.716
