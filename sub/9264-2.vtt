15:58.624 --> 16:01.085
(Buddy)
WHAT ARE ALL MY TROPHIES
DOING OUT IN THE FRONT?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.295
I DON'T WANT 'EM ANYMORE.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.588
YOU CAN GET 'EM
OUT OF HERE BY SUNDAY

16:03.629 --> 16:04.505
OR THEY'RE GOING
IN THE GARBAGE.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.299

16:06.340 --> 16:07.175

‐ YEAH, FIVE MINUTES.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.551
‐ CAN I COME IN MY HOUSE PLEASE?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.261
YOU KNOW WHAT,
FRANKLY, BUDDY,

16:10.303 --> 16:12.471
I DON'T THINK I FEEL SAFE.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.307
I'M SORRY, PAM,
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.226
YOU KNOW...
I ADMIT, I LOST IT.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.896
I JUST, UH...

16:19.937 --> 16:21.147
YOU KNOW, A MAN CAN ONLY
BE PUSHED SO FAR.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.483
OH, DON'T YOU EVEN DARE TALK
TO ME ABOUT BEING PUSHED, BUDDY.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.818
I AM THE VICTIM HERE.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.111
YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

16:27.153 --> 16:28.487
FOR US TO LOSE
THE INNOCENT VICTIM STUFF.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.989
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE TOO MUCH.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.990
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.617
MOM.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.160
COME ON, DAD,

16:48.549 --> 16:50.468

16:53.512 --> 16:54.513
AND I ALWAYS WANT
A SMOKE MACHINE

16:54.513 --> 16:56.015
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.600
I MEAN, HOW OFTEN
DO YOU GET A SMOKE MACHINE

16:57.642 --> 16:59.143
IN A PLACE
WITH A BAND, RIGHT?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.186
THANK YOU.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.188
HEY!

17:02.188 --> 17:06.984

17:12.406 --> 17:14.867
OKAY.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.161
SO WHERE DID YOU GO
THE OTHER NIGHT?

17:17.203 --> 17:21.415
OH, UM, I ACTUALLY‐‐
I HAD ANOTHER PARTY TO GO TO.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.458
OH, COOL.
YEAH, NO.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.127
I MEAN, SOMEONE HAD SAID
THEY SAW YOU GET PICKED UP

17:25.169 --> 17:26.504
BY YOUR DAD OR SOMETHING.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.381
OH NO, THAT WAS
MY OLDER FRIEND.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.173
YEAH.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.010
BUT I GOT A LOT
OF STUDYING TO DO,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
SO I'LL, UH...
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.222
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SCHOOL STARTED, HUH?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.390

17:37.390 --> 17:39.016
OKAY.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.687
SO...
SO I GUESS THIS IS GOOD‐BYE?

17:42.728 --> 17:45.147
I GUESS IT IS.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.274
WOW.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.150
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HEY,
DON'T GO GROWING UP TOO FAST,

17:48.192 --> 17:51.070
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE A HEARTBREAKER.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.406
GUYS ARE JUST GONNA
BE BUSTING DOWN YOUR DOORS,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.157
SO WATCH OUT.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.413
SO I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, KID.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.254
HEY, GLEN.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.505

18:09.547 --> 18:11.257
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
WE JUST DROPPED BY.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.717
I'M GONNA PLOP DOWN
ON YOUR COUCH RIGHT NOW.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.427
I'M EXHAUSTED.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.387
I JUST WALKED ALL THE WAY
FROM MY HOUSE.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.722
YOU WALKED ALL THE WAY
FROM YOUR HOUSE?

18:17.763 --> 18:20.516
YEAH, WE DID.
IT IS BOILING HOT.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.018
YEAH, IT'S 105 DEGREES
OUT THERE.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.686
THAT'S COMPLETELY INSANE.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.105
WELL, IT'S NOT INSANE
WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY

18:26.105 --> 18:28.733
WHO WON'T STAY QUIET UNLESS
YOU'RE MOVIN' HER ALL THE TIME.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.234
AND I FIGURED I'D KILL
TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.068
RIGHT.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.614
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH THAT, GLEN?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.115
IT'S NO PROBLEM,

18:36.157 --> 18:38.451
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE PROFUSELY SWEATING,

18:38.451 --> 18:39.785
YOU GOT A NEWBORN BABY.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.621
YOU'RE WALKING
IN 105‐DEGREE TEMPERATURE.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.663
I MEAN, YOU'RE PERSPIRING.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.664
IT'S YOUR GLANDS.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.166
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T NEED YOU

18:45.166 --> 18:46.000
TALKING ABOUT
MY PERSPIRATION.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.126
I DON'T NEED YOU
TALKING ABOUT MY GLANDS.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.252
‐ THANK YOU.
‐ I'M SORRY.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.629
I CAME HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THE JOB.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.546
WHICH, IT SEEMS TO ME,

18:50.588 --> 18:51.505
YOU MIGHT NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP WITH.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.423
I MIGHT NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP WITH IT.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.759
I'M REALLY NOT QUALIFIED
TO BE DOING IT,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.260
TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.637
BUT I THINK
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS,

18:57.637 --> 18:59.096
IS YOUR BEHAVIOR,
YOU BRINGING THIS BABY HERE.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.098
I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT THE BABY'S HEALTH.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.224
IT COULD GET SICK IN HERE.
EXCUSE ME, GLEN.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.476
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.144
RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW,
OKAY?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.313
THIS ISN'T MY FIRST BARBEQUE,
GLEN, ALL RIGHT.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.522
SO I DON'T APPRECIATE

19:08.564 --> 19:10.816
YOU GOING ON AND ON AND ON
ABOUT WHAT A BAD MOTHER I AM.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.401
OKAY?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.402
I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.528
OH, REALLY‐‐REALLY?
NO.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.322
OH, REALLY, WELL, THAT'S WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.406
I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.574
WELL...
[baby crying]

19:18.616 --> 19:20.326
‐ WHAT I AM SAYING, ALTHOUGH...
‐ NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.328
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
TO SAY IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW,

19:22.328 --> 19:23.746
BECAUSE, FRANKLY,
YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE, BIT,

19:23.788 --> 19:25.164
TAMMY, OKAY?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.540
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.541
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
I'M NOT YOUR DOCTOR.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.585
WELL, NO,
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.253
I WAS TRYING TO HELP
BY COMING OVER HERE.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.797
WHICH I THINK YOU NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.340
SO DON'T YOU GO
AND YOU JUDGE ME...

19:34.382 --> 19:36.258
ON WHAT KIND OF MOTHER
I'M BEING.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.218
HOW DARE YOU?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.303
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO DO, TAMMY.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.596
WELL, HOW DARE YOU.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.847
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
IT SOUNDED LIKE TO ME.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.265
I'M SORRY.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.308
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO UPSET YOU OR...

19:44.350 --> 19:45.309
WELL, TOO LATE.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.353
THIS IS JUST A BAD IDEA.

19:47.395 --> 19:51.357
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU JUST GO ON AND DO YOUR JOB.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.191
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
YOU WANT SOME WATER
OR SOMETHING?

19:54.402 --> 19:59.198
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA
GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER, OKAY?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.827
HEY, UH,
JULIE, IT'S MATT.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.621
UM, YOU TOLD ME

20:05.663 --> 20:09.166
AND IT'S LATER,
SO I'M CALLING.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.794
ANYWAYS, CALL ME BACK.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.130
AND THEN
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.258
BYE.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.388
(Tammy)
ALL RIGHT, GRACIE.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.181
THERE'S A BUMP.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.400
HEY, MRS. TAYLOR!

20:34.400 --> 20:35.901
HEY HEY!
JASON STREET.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.319
HOW YOU DOING?

20:37.361 --> 20:39.071
I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.573
‐ GREAT, NEVER BETTER.
‐ AWESOME.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.699
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD HAVE...

20:41.741 --> 20:43.409
‐ SEE BABY GRACIE?
‐ HI, GRACIE.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.369
UH, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
HAVE A SECOND OF YOUR TIME?

20:45.411 --> 20:46.746
‐ SURE.
‐ I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.748
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

20:48.789 --> 20:49.790
WE'RE JUST WALKING HOME.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.877
I, UH...

20:52.918 --> 20:55.671
I'VE BEEN
HAVING THIS DREAM LATELY.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.590
A LOT.
AND YOU'RE IN IT.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.759
OH, LORD.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.596
SO IN THE DREAM
YOU TELL ME TO GET UP AND WALK.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.098
AND I DO.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.767
‐ I WALK.
‐ UH‐HUH.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.685
'CAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.729
YOU MAKE ME WALK.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.189
REALLY?

21:13.230 --> 21:15.274
YEAH.
YEAH.

21:15.316 --> 21:19.612
AND ONE DAY
AFTER HAVING THE DREAM,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.280
I FOUND OUT
I COULD DO THIS AGAIN.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.615
I CAN MAKE A FIST
WITH MY RIGHT HAND.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.241
WHICH I COULD NOT DO BEFORE.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.620
AND I STILL CAN'T DO IT
WITH MY LEFT, BUT...

21:27.620 --> 21:30.498
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT, JASON.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.833
I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU,
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE...

21:32.875 --> 21:35.795
LIKE IT REALLY
MEANS SOMETHING.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.422
I THINK IT MEANS
I'M GONNA WALK AGAIN.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.715
SOON.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.760
HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:42.802 --> 21:48.390
SO, UH, ANYWAY, I GUESS I JUST
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.810
YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY‐‐
BYE, GRACIE‐‐ALL RIGHT?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.812
YOU'RE WELCOME‐‐I'M SO GLAD
I GOT TO SEE YOU TODAY, JASON.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.480
ME TOO.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.607
YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY,
MRS. TAYLOR! THANK YOU.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.491
(Taylor)
HURRY UP, LET'S GO.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.951
(Antoine)
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
COACH.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.578
YOU GOT THAT BABY
ON A SCHEDULE?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.872
OH, WAIT, YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW THAT, WOULD YOU?

22:11.872 --> 22:14.333
[laughs]
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY,

22:14.375 --> 22:17.002
HOW'S YOUR WIFE FEEL
ABOUT BEING ALONE WITH THE BABY?

22:17.002 --> 22:18.963
THAT WAS A QUESTION, COACH.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.256
HURRY UP, LET'S GO.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.966
LOOK AT THAT SCOWL.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.008
I GOTTA GET A PICTURE
OF THIS, COACH.

22:23.008 --> 22:23.843
HOLD ON.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.303
I'M GONNA SEND THIS
TO YOUR BABY.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.013
THINK EVERYTHING'S A DAMN JOKE,
DON'T YOU?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.765
IT'S ALL A BIG DAMN JOKE
TO YOU.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.351
ALL THE TALENT YOU GOT,
WHAT DO YOU USE IT FOR, HUH?

22:32.393 --> 22:34.687
GETTING FREE STUFF
AND LETTING YOUR TEAM DOWN.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.855
YOU KNOW
WHAT MY OPINION IS?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.273
YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO PLAY THE GAME.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.065
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

22:38.107 --> 22:39.441
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

22:39.483 --> 22:40.526
YOU LET YOUR TEAM DOWN,

22:40.568 --> 22:42.027
YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.612
THEN AGAIN, YOU DON'T CARE,
DO YOU, HUH?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.823
YOU DON'T CARE IF YOU
FINISH OUT THE SEASON.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.824
'CAUSE I'M SURE
BIG OL' ANTOINE,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.325
HE'S GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.452
HE'S GOT A BACKUP PLAN,
DOESN'T HE?

22:50.494 --> 22:52.621
WHO AM I TALKING TO?

22:52.663 --> 22:54.748
WHO AM I?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.502
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

23:01.255 --> 23:03.465
[drumming]

23:14.560 --> 23:16.812
OH, HEY, LANDRY.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.732
UM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS

23:19.732 --> 23:20.733
ON MAKING THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.402
I'M ACTUALLY SORT OF

23:23.444 --> 23:24.695
YOUR RALLY GIRL.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.988

23:26.030 --> 23:27.531
SO YOU'RE MY RALLY GIRL?

23:27.573 --> 23:28.991
WOW, LANDRY.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.910
YOUR OWN
PERSONAL RALLY GIRL.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.495
I GUESS YOU'VE ARRIVED.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.540
ANYWAY, WE CAN WORK OUT
THE DETAILS LATER.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.708
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.419
YOU THINK
THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS

23:40.419 --> 23:42.087
ARE CAPABLE OF EVIL?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.881
I'M GONNA BORROW HIM
FOR A SECOND.

23:43.923 --> 23:44.882
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY SOME ARE.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.425
I DON'T...

23:46.425 --> 23:47.760
I WAS ASKING HER A QUESTION.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.761
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO RIP ME AWAY.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.511
I'M NOT A LITTLE KID.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.430
YOU DON'T HAVE

WHOLESOME TROPHY ROOM.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.416

I THINK I LOST, RIGGO.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.795
[sighs]

35:30.795 --> 35:32.464

36:43.368 --> 36:46.371
IN A GAME...

36:46.413 --> 36:48.540
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

36:48.581 --> 36:52.127
[Buddy muttering]

37:02.178 --> 37:06.391
WHY IS EVERYTHING
ALWAYS FALLING APART?

37:09.227 --> 37:14.232
LISTEN, UH, I THINK
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.652
BELIEVE ME, I'VE SEEN
A FEW DRUNKS IN MY DAY

37:17.694 --> 37:18.820
AND HE'S NOT ONE OF 'EM.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.114
HE'S NOT.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.491
HE'S JUST SAD,
THAT'S ALL.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.288
HE MADE HIS BED.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.626
HOW YOU DOING?

37:35.462 --> 37:38.131
I'M OKAY.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.259

37:42.594 --> 37:44.471
I'M GREAT.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.433
YOU BETTER GO.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.435
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A THREE‐WAY TO GET TO

37:50.477 --> 37:52.395
OR SOMETHING.

38:01.613 --> 38:05.408
GOOD NIGHT, LYLA.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.629
ALL RIGHT, TAMMY, MAKE SURE
SHE'S GETTING ENOUGH FLUIDS.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.756
OFFER HER FORMULA
AFTER YOU BREASTFEED.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.300
AND SHE NEEDS TO EAT
ONCE EVERY HOUR, OKAY?

38:22.342 --> 38:23.635
MAYBE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
CAN TAKE SHIFTS.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.971
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.306
‐ SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
‐ OKAY.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.809
DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY
YOU CAN CALL?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.602
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
DRIVE YOURSELF HOME.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.728
UM...

38:33.770 --> 38:37.482
BABE, SHE'S FINE.
I SWEAR.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.151
THE DOCTOR
BROUGHT HER FEVER RIGHT DOWN.

38:40.193 --> 38:43.488
AND SHE'S STARTING
TO SLEEP NOW.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.491
SHE'S NICE AND QUIET.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.326
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
RUNNING HOME.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.953
YOU JUST STAY.
SIT TIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.873
I DON'T WANT YOU
COMING BACK HERE, HONEY.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.167
HONEY, I'M FINE, I SWEAR.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.460
AND SHE'S GOOD.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.420
IT'S A TRIP
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.798
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
JULIE GOT DRAGGED OVER HERE?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.842
ALL RIGHT,
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.343
I PROMISE.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.680
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.516

39:19.691 --> 39:20.942
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.862
[crying]

39:23.862 --> 39:25.530
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S WAKING UP
ON YOU.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.823
[sniffling]

39:26.865 --> 39:28.700
I'M SORRY.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.869
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.370
I'M SORRY,
I KNOW IT'S LATE.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.582
NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S FINE.
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.

39:35.623 --> 39:36.833
YOU'RE SO SWEET,

39:36.875 --> 39:38.001
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE TO CALL.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.377
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.879
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'RE REAL NICE.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.463
I'M SORRY I WAS
KIND OF A BITCH TO YOU.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.716
I'M JUST A LITTLE EMOTIONAL
AT THE MOMENT.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.467
YOU WEREN'T A BITCH
TO ME AT ALL.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.969
IT'S FINE.
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.471
YOU'RE SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.724
‐ DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING?
‐ I THINK SO, YEAH.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.725
OKAY, LET'S GO.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.560
OKAY, SWEETHEART.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.228
‐ THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY.
‐ THANK YOU.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.648
HEY, YOU KNOW,
THIS MIGHT NOT

40:00.690 --> 40:01.524
BE ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.234
I'M NOT TRYING
TO STEP OVER THE LINE,

40:03.276 --> 40:05.403
BUT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL...

40:05.403 --> 40:07.989
THIS LIVING APART
FROM YOUR HUSBAND THING?

40:08.031 --> 40:11.701
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF THAT EXACTLY?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.912
I DON'T KNOW.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.789
THAT WAS JUST MY IDEA.

40:16.789 --> 40:20.418
IT WAS JUST
A STUPID IDEA.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.030
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

40:50.657 --> 40:53.534
I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.413
GOD, I...

40:57.455 --> 40:59.791
YOU KNOW, HE...

41:02.001 --> 41:04.420
HE WASN'T GONNA STOP.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.969
HE WAS JUST GONNA
KEEP ON DOING THAT TO ME.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.638
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH ME,

41:13.638 --> 41:16.349
BUT I AM...

41:18.017 --> 41:19.936
I AM SO GLAD HE'S DEAD.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.024
I JUST, UM...

41:27.443 --> 41:29.988
I WISH I WAS THE ONE
WHO KILLED HIM.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.656
DON'T‐‐
DON'T SAY THAT.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.658
‐ NO.
‐ DON'T.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.659
YOU ARE THE BEST GUY...

41:34.659 --> 41:37.453
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.788
NO, AND IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO YOU

41:38.830 --> 41:40.790
BECAUSE OF ME...

41:42.041 --> 41:45.503
I WOULD NEVER
FORGIVE MYSELF.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.006
I AM SO SORRY.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.341
OH, NAH.
DON'T BE SORRY.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.592
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

41:51.634 --> 41:55.972
[crying]

42:00.560 --> 42:02.437
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

42:02.478 --> 42:03.521
STOP.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.858
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
OKAY?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.901
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
