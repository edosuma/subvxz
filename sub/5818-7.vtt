DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.600 --> 00:04.806
What was the deal with you and Stefan?

00:05.040 --> 00:06.804
I was the first love of Stefan's life.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.201
Stefan, meet Julian.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.444
Does Stefan Salvatore know
that you're pregnant with his child?

00:11.600 --> 00:13.967
- What?
- I wanted to tell you in person.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.167
Julian made sure
there was nothing to tell.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.446
Julian makes me better.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.284
He made her vindictive and cruel.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.927
Lily gave Kai the idea
to put Elena in that Sleeping Beauty coma.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.561
I could've been a father.
I want him dead, Damon.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.761
I'm in.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.645
If you're asking me to choose
between you and Julian,

00:31.920 --> 00:33.604
the love of my life, please understand.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.448
Julian is looking for Oscar's car.
I intend to find it first.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.648
CAROLINE: She was
supposed to be Ric's wife,

00:39.840 --> 00:43.287
who died with two kids inside of her
on their wedding day.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.806
CAROLINE: What is that?
RIC: My wedding video.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.126
I recognize this chant.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.290
They were trying to save
the next generation of Gemini twins.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.523
I think Alaric's babies are still alive.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.002
They're inside of you.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.441
Twenty-three minutes.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.647
Just enough time for me to get in,

01:03.800 --> 01:05.689
take out Little Miss Stabbypants
and grab Caroline.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.167
Oh, that's it? That's your plan?
Just take her out?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.651
It's simple. It's classic. Come on.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.962
Yeah, listen, I saw the X
carved into Stefan's chest.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.845
Pretty sure she's not playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
Look, this is a trap.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.441
Oh, I know it's a trap.
But I'm gonna spring it, so Stefan can't.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.011
Well, look, I didn't get a babysitter

01:19.200 --> 01:20.531
on 30 seconds' notice
just to sit in the car.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.290
You're not gonna just sit in the car.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.527
Turn, turn, turn.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.727
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:25.880 --> 01:27.166
(GRUNTS)

01:27.360 --> 01:29.681
There's no way
Stefan didn't see Caroline's broadcast.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.006
He'll be here in a minute.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.004
When he gets here, pump him full of
vervain so he can't hero his way in there.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.326
If Caroline's in danger,
I'm coming with you.

01:35.520 --> 01:39.411
She doesn't want Caroline, she wants him.
If he goes in there, he's dead.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.527
CAROLINE: Stefan. Stefan, please!

01:50.680 --> 01:52.569
Guess you're gonna have to
settle for the other one, Blondie.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.251
Stefan, I...

01:56.200 --> 01:59.010
We apologize for the interruption
to your current program.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.361
My name is Caroline.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.601
Well, that's not good.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.171
Please listen carefully.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.046
(GRUNTS)

02:06.560 --> 02:10.848
CAROLINE: I have an urgent message
for Stefan Salvatore.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.240
(SIGHS) Simple enough.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.251
Two lines, you're pregnant,
one line, you're not.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.124
And how many lines
if you've been mystically knocked up

02:22.360 --> 02:23.725
by a coven of dead witches?

02:23.920 --> 02:26.082
- I guess we'll find out in three minutes.
-(BEEPS)

02:26.240 --> 02:27.526
(CAROLINE SIGHS)

02:28.760 --> 02:30.125
(SIGHS) This is crazy.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.245
You're an Occult Studies professor.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.966
Have you ever come across anything
about a pregnant vampire?

02:35.240 --> 02:38.289
No. But until a few weeks ago,
I'd never heard of a stone

02:38.520 --> 02:40.761
that was full of
tormented vampire souls, either.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.810
But how would it even be possible?
I'm technically dead.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.407
Well, your body
basically functions normally.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.768
Your heart beats. You breathe.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.409
I mean, is it that far outside
the realm of possibility

02:52.600 --> 02:55.444
that your body could support a baby?
Or two?

02:58.640 --> 03:02.725
- Why would the coven want me to?
- I don't think they had a choice.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.926
The Gemini were all dying.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.447
They couldn't let the future of
their coven perish along with them.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.768
So, they had to put the babies
someplace safe.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.524
Inside a body that wouldn't die.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.205
- Is that cornbread I smell?
- We're hosting Thanksgiving.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.205
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.486
Well, pre-Thanksgiving. Whatever.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.564
Whatever happened to taking out Julian?
Remember him?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.091
Killed what would've been your first-born?

03:36.320 --> 03:39.324
You know, I cleared out my entire schedule
so we could make that guy count worms.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.647
Unless you're too busy baking?

03:40.800 --> 03:45.044
Julian knows that I want him dead.
So, our next move needs to be smart.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.243
We're probably only gonna have
one more shot at this.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.325
Not quite following the whole
Martha Stewart strategy, to be honest.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.006
I am planning on recruiting an ally.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.840

04:27.360 --> 04:31.206
But I don't understand.
I mean, Valerie was so certain.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.525
Well, I guess she was wrong.
Or playing some twisted game.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.003
(SCOFFS) Either way, I trust that
a lot more than I trust her.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.690
(BOTH SIGHING)

I'm really sorry.
I know how much you wanted this.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

04:55.360 --> 04:57.203
Hey, Matt. Now's not really a good time.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.051
Bonnie and I found two dozen people

04:59.200 --> 05:00.884
compelled to hang out
at the high school last night.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.531
Been trying to call her,
but she won't pick up.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.881
I'm starting to get a little worried.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.246
I think she's with Enzo.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.246
What? Well, now I'm a lot worried.
What the hell is she doing with him?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.482
I don't know.
Were you able to clear them out?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.364
We had to tranquilize them
just to get them out of there,

05:13.520 --> 05:15.488
but they were all back this morning
like they never left.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.727
Why would someone compel people

05:16.920 --> 05:19.321
to gather at the high school
of an abandoned town?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.411
Matt?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.560
Matt?

05:32.240 --> 05:35.403
Hey, Car, how fast
can you get to the Grill?

05:36.840 --> 05:38.080
(EXHALES)

05:38.560 --> 05:41.609
I invited you over here
because we can't keep doing this.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.764
I mean, I want us all to start over.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.726
If the Pilgrims and Indians could do it,
I'm sure there's hope for us.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.923
We call them Native Americans now.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.771
But we didn't bring you here to correct
your outdated racial slurs,

05:54.120 --> 05:55.360
did we, Stefan?

05:55.560 --> 05:57.961
I want to convince you of all the reasons

05:58.280 --> 06:01.045
that you need to help us
get rid of Julian.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.044
I'm sorry, if this is some kind of set up?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.368
Just hear me out for a second.

06:09.440 --> 06:13.889
In 1863, I got Valerie pregnant.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.806
She kept it a secret from me,
from you, from everyone.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.647
And Julian found out about it somehow
and he felt threatened by it.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.442
He beat her until the baby
was no longer alive.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.082
Her child, your grandchild,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.327
was murdered by Julian.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.130
She swore me to secrecy,
but the truth is too important.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.802
You need to know what kind of man he is.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.245
I think what Stefan's trying to say is,
you have really crappy taste.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.409
My son, Valerie lied to me
for over a century about you.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.286
Then she tried to kill a member
of my family in cold blood,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.000
and tried to incinerate
the love of my life.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.009

Well, I guess the joke's
on me then, right?

- I mean, I was an idiot who believed her.
- I did, too. About many things.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.282
But I will not make
that same mistake again.

Ever mention I like your style?

Well, I had a feeling we were gonna
have to do this the hard way.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.007
Best Thanksgiving ever.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.004
BONNIE: Why would a centuries-old vampire
with a bunch of witch groupies

08:12.200 --> 08:14.089
be so desperate to find anything

08:14.240 --> 08:16.766
collecting dust at
Midlothian County Impound?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.251
Seems a little beneath him.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.728
Well, if Julian wants it, then so do I.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.730
Are we talking about Oscar's car or Lily?

08:25.080 --> 08:27.162
You're not doing this
to stop a psychopath.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.447
You just want the girl.

Congratulations, you've just unlocked

Stop treating Lily like
some prize to be won.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.919
Spoken like someone
who's never been fought over.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.761
It's not the turn-on you think it is.

-(CHUCKLES)

Well, I'm assuming Julian doesn't want it
for its Blue Book value.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.520
Charming.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.720
I'll wager
this is what Julian's looking for.

09:14.440 --> 09:18.047
- Wonder what makes it so special?
- I think I've seen that before.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.641
When I was doing research on the stone.
Let me see what I can dig up.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.645
No, I don't need research to tell me
which one's the pointy end.

09:23.880 --> 09:24.961
What more do we need to know?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.605
If he wants to kill someone with it,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.165
or he's worried about being killed by it.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.447
There's one way to find out.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.011
Ram it through his chest,
see what happens.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.241
I know what's not gonna happen,

09:32.440 --> 09:36.161
Lily falling hopelessly in love with the
person who murdered her sweetheart.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.490
- Not if I make it look like self-defense.
- Good idea.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.521
Go pick a fight with an extremely
powerful, unhinged ancient vampire.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.126
Should work out great.

Is that a hint of concern for me
I detect in your voice?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.684
Now that I think about it,
go ahead and kill each other.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.684
Win-win for me.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.600
What are you doing?

10:02.840 --> 10:04.365

10:04.520 --> 10:05.931
like Giuseppe did way back when.

But somewhere along the way,

10:13.320 --> 10:17.120
this little warning light started
blinking, "Psycho! Psycho!"

10:17.320 --> 10:18.765
We just need that little light
to blink again.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.041
What are you talking about?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.571
It's a pattern, Lily.

You can't see it with Julian, just like
you couldn't see it with Giuseppe.

Thanksgiving we had back in 1851?

-1851.
- Mmm.

Was that the year
that Father took me out to the farm

10:36.120 --> 10:37.770
and made me behead my pet turkey?

10:38.040 --> 10:40.281
- Yeah, that would be the year.
- Oh.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.204
That was a doozy.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.243
If I could take just a moment to say
how thankful I am to the good Lord

10:52.440 --> 10:55.410
for giving me a beautiful wife,
two fine boys,

10:55.600 --> 10:58.001
a table filled with fine food,

10:58.400 --> 11:00.721
and a stomach big enough to fit it all in.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.200

Son, eat your dinner, please.

- What's the matter, sweetheart?
- It was not an invitation, Damon.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.246
Eat.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.807
- Why is he not eating?
- Because this is Sami.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.567
That animal was put on this earth
to be sustenance, not your friend.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.600
Now, you will clean your plate,

11:32.800 --> 11:36.122
or you will spend the night
in the root cellar wishing you had.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.011
Mother, please do not make me eat her.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.005
You heard your father, Damon.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.243
DAMON: Rest in peace, Sami.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.645
I kept you from wasting
a perfectly good meal.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.131
I still don't see what any of this
has to do with my current relationship.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.527
Of course you don't see it, Lily.
That's the whole point.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.165
You're too blind to see it.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.523
You're drawn to men who manipulate you
into seeing what they want.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.569
- Men who abuse you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.644
The vervain ropes searing into my flesh
are distracting me

12:26.840 --> 12:30.049
from concentrating on your lecture
about tolerating abuse.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.165
This is pointless.
Pointless with pumpkin pie, but pointless.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.806
No, we are here to open up her eyes.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.970
You're gonna sit here, and you're gonna
listen to every single word I say.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.529
And by the end of the day,
you're gonna help us kill your boyfriend.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.324
I found more at the court house.
And another dozen at the supermarket.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.808
-(SIGHS) What's with all the IVs?
- Saline. To keep them hydrated.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.361
Which you'd only need if you're gonna
keep them here for a while.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.327
They're using them as human blood banks.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.045
Well, I guess we know what the heretics
are having for Thanksgiving dinner.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.567
Problem is, I can't find
a single bite mark on any of them.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.764
Which is somehow creepier.
They're not being fed on.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.200
They're being fed.

13:12.920 --> 13:17.050
Found these in the trash can.
There's salmon, steak, iron-rich foods.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.004
Probably to boost their
red blood cell count.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.409
It's like someone's fattening the cattle
for the slaughter.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.881
(VOMITS)

13:26.080 --> 13:27.844
- Whoa, Car. Hey... Um...
-(CAROLINE COUGHS)

13:29.160 --> 13:30.207
(GROANS)

13:30.360 --> 13:32.522
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.889
No, you're not fine. You just puked.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.562
I think I had an expired blood bag
last night, or something.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.846
You know, and then the talk of the food,
and the iron and the slaughtered cattle.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.769
So, you're a vampire with food poisoning?

13:50.040 --> 13:53.761
Yes, Matt.
I'm a vampire with food poisoning,

13:53.960 --> 13:56.201
standing in a room
of much bigger problems.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.926
So, stop looking at me like
you've never seen a vampire vomit before

13:59.120 --> 14:02.090
and start thinking of a way
to break their compulsion.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.691
Short of turning them into vampires,

14:03.880 --> 14:06.326
I can't think of a way to
break the compulsion.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.002
Then maybe we don't have to break it.
Maybe someone can siphon it away.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.840
(SIGHS)

14:20.800 --> 14:23.963
Ah! The barkeep.
Did you forget your tip jar?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.440
You know who I am?

14:25.640 --> 14:29.087
Oh, yes. The steerage waif
Lily took pity upon.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.602
- She told me all about you.
- That's funny. She hardly mentioned you.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.926
So, what brings you here?

14:35.120 --> 14:37.851
I left something behind
that means a great deal to me.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.051
MY guitar.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.568
Haven't seen one lying around.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.487
Perhaps Lily threw it out
with the rest of the rubbish.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.524
Yeah, I doubt that.
She loves it when I play for her.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.246
Sometimes she begs me to.
And there is no point trying to deny her.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.961
I hope you're not suggesting
anything untoward.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.321
Oh, and if I were?

15:01.520 --> 15:04.649
Well, we'd have to settle it
like gentlemen.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.282
But... (GRUNTS) I assured Lily

15:10.600 --> 15:13.331
that there would be
no more bloodshed in the house.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.001
Did you make any promises about outside?

15:25.040 --> 15:29.489
You want me to siphon the compulsion
out of all these people?

15:29.880 --> 15:30.961
(SCOFFS)

15:31.200 --> 15:33.043
Do you have any idea
how long that will take?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.684
Uh, probably the amount of time that
it'll take to siphon one person

15:37.040 --> 15:38.849
times the amount of people in this room.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.528
I am all for scuttling Julian's plans,

15:41.720 --> 15:44.724
but siphoning these people
won't make a difference.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.243
He'll just replace them.
You'd be trading one life for another.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.170
Speaking of, I can't imagine
this is the safest town

15:52.360 --> 15:54.931
for someone with your status
to be roaming around in.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.531
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.570
I wouldn't call
a pregnant vampire nothing.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.603
- What?
- I am not pregnant.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.086
I am not pregnant.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.284
Okay, Valerie over here
convinced poor Alaric

16:06.520 --> 16:08.761
that the Gemini Coven dumped its
twin babies into my...

16:08.960 --> 16:11.167
You know what? Never mind.
Because it is not true.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.641
It is not true. A test confirmed it.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.411
Yeah, and thanks to you,
Alaric is probably still at home,

16:16.600 --> 16:18.728
waiting for that second blue line
to show up.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.201
So, maybe now would be
an appropriate time to call him

16:21.400 --> 16:26.440
and explain how you could get something
so important so incredibly wrong.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.962
Do I need to remind you that
you summoned me here for my help?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.128
If you don't think my talents
are up to snuff,

16:32.320 --> 16:35.210
then I will gladly find other things
to do with my time.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.160
I'm sorry.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.000
(SIGHS)

16:43.560 --> 16:44.800
I'm sorry.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.250
Maybe it was just a momentary lapse
of magical juju.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.847
Look, can you just please help us?
Take away these people's compulsion?

16:58.560 --> 16:59.800
(SIGHS)

17:09.119 --> 17:11.805
JULIAN: Do you know what true bravery is?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.240
Most people don't.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.002
It isn't going against incredible odds
and thinking you're going to win.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.042
No, that's merely confidence.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.290
Bravery is knowing you're going to lose,

17:22.800 --> 17:25.246
but doing it anyway.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.240
(GRUNTS)

17:27.640 --> 17:30.291
That's your strategy?
Bore me into submission?

17:30.520 --> 17:31.760
(CHUCKLES)

17:32.360 --> 17:34.169
Well, if you won't let me give you
an honorable way out,

17:34.400 --> 17:38.086
I have no choice
but to give you an honorable death.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.284
Well, let's get on with it.
Choose your weapon.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.360
(GRUNTING)

17:52.480 --> 17:53.766
(CHUCKLES)

17:55.120 --> 17:56.360
(GRUNTING)

18:00.840 --> 18:03.491
Are these entirely necessary?
They're quite painful.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.166
- Oh, does that burn?
- You know it does.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.642
- Let's see if I can fix that.
-(LILY GRUNTS)

18:09.280 --> 18:10.805
Nope, guess not.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.004
- That's enough, Damon.
- What? She thinks this is painful?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.562
Try being 12 and helpless.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.846
I have finished. May I be excused?

18:29.640 --> 18:33.804
In a moment. Lily, a bourbon, please.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.201
I took this out
for a special occasion today.

18:45.520 --> 18:49.161
But in the process, I discovered quite
a bit of money missing from my bureau.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.129
- You would not know anything about that?
- No.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.727
Stefan? Have you been
rummaging around your father's bureau?

18:58.080 --> 19:01.402
Well, it did not just grow legs
and walk off now, did it?

19:23.040 --> 19:26.647
Which one of you did it?
Confess here and now.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.160
Like a man.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.202
Who took the money?

19:31.680 --> 19:33.011
It was not us.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.044
To think of all the work
your mother has put into

19:40.280 --> 19:42.647
grooming you to be
proper young men of society.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.842
Do you really want to put her
through the heartache of thinking

19:45.040 --> 19:47.008
she is a complete and utter failure?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.447
- No.
- Then what would a man do?

19:49.760 --> 19:51.967
- He would tell the truth.
- And the truth is?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.520
I took it.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.444
I didn't raise you to be a thief.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.525
But I also didn't raise you to be a liar.
And you have told the truth here today.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.531
Have you learned your lesson?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.766
This is to make certain you remember it.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.480
(DAMON SCREAMS)

20:30.480 --> 20:32.050
I didn't take Giuseppe's money.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.165
I only confessed because I was afraid
of what he'd do to Stefan.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.640
STEFAN: It's your pattern, Lily.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.121
Julian is a monster.
Giuseppe was a monster--

20:39.320 --> 20:43.769
You don't think I knew that?
I was married to the man for 20 years.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.323
What kind of fool do you take me for?

20:46.560 --> 20:47.925
Do you think I believed you
when I caught you

20:48.120 --> 20:49.485
digging for ice in the ice box
and you told me

20:49.720 --> 20:51.848
you scratched your arm playing?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.282
(SIGHS) I'm not blind, Damon.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.531
I knew exactly what he did to you
that night.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.167
I had gone to fetch his bourbon
like he asked.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.560
And I was on the stairs
when I heard your scream.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.204
You ran by me clutching your arm.
You didn't see me through your tears.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.323
And you did nothing.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.002
- You did nothing?
- That is not true.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.211
- Everything that I did-- (GASPS)
- Lily.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.200
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

21:24.200 --> 21:28.125
Someone's trying to kill Julian.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.521
What are you talking about?

21:29.760 --> 21:33.606
To protect him from you, we did a spell.

21:34.680 --> 21:38.480
We bound Julian's life to mine.

21:39.680 --> 21:44.163
(HEAVY BREATHING)
We're linked. If he dies, so do I.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.126
(LAUGHS)

21:59.880 --> 22:03.248
- I see you two have met before.
- Where did you get that?

22:05.480 --> 22:06.766
(GRUNTING)

22:14.080 --> 22:16.731
You took a wrong turn
and ended up in Mystic Falls.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.161
Leave and forget everything
that you saw here.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.240
(SIGHS)

22:35.720 --> 22:37.006
What?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.680
You sure you don't wanna talk about this
whole Valerie baby-spell thing?

22:39.920 --> 22:43.003
- There is nothing to talk about.
- I've never seen you puke before.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.841
That is because I am polite, not pregnant.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.369
I can't have Alaric's babies inside of me.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.006
Not only is it impossible,

22:52.200 --> 22:55.647
but it literally defies the physics
of the universe.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.040
VALERIE: Beau.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.730
I don't know what atrocities
Julian has planned,

23:06.360 --> 23:09.921
but you're better than this. I know you.
I'm your friend.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.809
(GRUNTS) Beau. Julian is evil.
He doesn't care about our family.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.724
He only cares about himself.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.970
In visique.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.720
(EXCLAIIVIS)

24:09.320 --> 24:10.560
(GRUNTS)

24:16.440 --> 24:18.363
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.007
I was the one who took the money.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.600
On Thanksgiving.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.087
- It was me.
- I don't understand.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.802
Your father never let me have anything.
I lived under his complete control.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.209
I had no means of my own.
No access to funds.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.882
You stood in the next room
as your son was being tortured,

24:44.120 --> 24:47.249
you didn't confess, and then you stayed
with the man for another five years?

24:47.440 --> 24:50.046
I was trying to save us.
We were gonna run away.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.842
I was gonna protect you boys,
we were never gonna see him again.

24:54.200 --> 24:59.604
But your father, even drunk and miserable,
was always one step ahead.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.849
Looking for these?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.687
- I don't know what those are.
- Train tickets.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.928
Three of them. Planning a trip, are we?

25:49.360 --> 25:51.522
Oh, Giuseppe, you've ruined all my fun.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.446
I thought it could be a surprise.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.881
I thought you could take the boys
to New York for a weekend

25:56.080 --> 25:58.481
and see that new steamship
we read about in the paper.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.767
(GRUNTS)

25:59.960 --> 26:02.930
You took that money.
And I punished Damon for your duplicity.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.370
Then you tried to steal my children
from me.

26:07.560 --> 26:12.122
Should you ever attempt that again,
I will take the boys far away from here.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.850
You will be alone.
And you will never see them again.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.570
Do you understand me?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.930
LILY: That's why I had to stay.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.850
Giuseppe was a monster.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.804
He wasn't manipulating me. I wasn't blind
to it. I knew it in my bones.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.128
The only thing I cared about
more than leaving him

26:33.360 --> 26:35.044
was protecting your brother and you.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.166
Everything that I did back then,

26:42.800 --> 26:44.165
I was doing for you.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.240
(GRUNTING)

27:00.320 --> 27:01.560
(GROANS)

27:08.320 --> 27:09.685
Little tip from the professional,

27:09.880 --> 27:12.770
next time you wanna kill
a bazillion-year-old psycho,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.761
don't pick a sword
from the juniors section.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.807
(GRUNTS)

27:18.000 --> 27:21.686
On the contrary, I reckon that sword was
forged for that very purpose.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.400

27:29.440 --> 27:30.680
Hmm.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.926
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:47.720 --> 27:48.960
Oh.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.080
You're here?

27:53.240 --> 27:54.605
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.405
And you're drunk.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.051
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, it's just peachy.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.771
Okay. I just came to get a book
that I left here, so...

28:11.720 --> 28:14.883
Uh, actually, I'm just gonna do
my research here, if that's okay with you.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.568
My office is your office.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.160
Great.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.931
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Nope.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.690
Okay. Didn't think so.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.367
So, Enzo found some sword in Oscar's car

28:37.560 --> 28:39.528
and is under the impression
it'll kill Julian.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.650
Found it. This is it, except it's...

28:52.120 --> 28:54.566
Does that look like the Phoenix Stone
to you?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.771
Yeah.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.849
Yeah, that looks like the Phoenix Stone
to me.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.565
Okay.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.842
"The stone gives the sword
its power against immortal foes.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.090
"Without it, the blade is merely a blade."

29:17.400 --> 29:18.640
Oh, no.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.927
ENZO: Nice aim.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.488
Bastard links his life to my mom's
and then engages in a duel?

29:25.680 --> 29:28.490
What is this, Hamlet community theater?

29:28.720 --> 29:29.960
(SCOFFS)

29:30.920 --> 29:32.490
Wait, back up.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.962
What are you talking about,
linked himself to your mum?

29:35.160 --> 29:36.969
He's using Lily as a human shield.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.083
Guess he'd forgotten about the part
that half the people

29:39.280 --> 29:41.487
actually left in this town hate her guts.

29:42.200 --> 29:46.000
Damon, tell me you did not just kill Lily.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.606
(GRUNTS)

29:55.280 --> 29:57.931
Shouldn't you be... Deader?

30:01.360 --> 30:02.600
(GRUNTS IN PAIN)

30:04.440 --> 30:05.646
Are you hurt?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.251
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.126
You're not really the one
that I'm worried about.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.484
(GROANS) Isn't it possible that
"Kill the psycho" and "Save the babies"

30:13.680 --> 30:15.489
just sound similar in witch-Latin?

30:15.680 --> 30:18.490
Not to mention that you've been out of
their loop for, like, 100 years.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.921
A thousand years could pass,
I would never forget that spell.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.521
There's not a day goes by
that I don't think about those words.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.768
Why do you know so much about this?

30:28.600 --> 30:31.729
Like you care? And it's not like
you believe anything I say.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.890
I'm willing to believe you.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.080
(VALERIE SIGHS)

30:38.680 --> 30:39.966
Okay?

30:41.200 --> 30:45.046
I need you to be
100% honest with me. Please.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.728
How do you know so much about the spell?

30:51.760 --> 30:55.890
Because I've used it.
I was pregnant before I turned.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.523
Julian knew that if Lily found out,
it would ruin his plans with her.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.440
She would want to return to
Mystic Falls instead.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.364
So, he promptly ended it.

31:07.080 --> 31:10.129
But I did everything in my power
to save the life inside me.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.728
I didn't have an entire coven
to work with, it was just me.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.562
Hard as I tried, I wasn't strong enough.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.370
But why would you having a baby make
Lily wanna come home to Mystic Falls?

31:31.680 --> 31:32.920
Oh.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.121
That's the big secret
that you have with Stefan.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.044
The baby was his?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.840
Our story may have ended in tragedy.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.644
But you have the chance to see
that your friend Alaric's doesn't.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.322
- Valerie, the test was negative.
- Test again.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.800
(GRUNTING)

32:09.640 --> 32:10.971
LILY: Don't!

32:12.880 --> 32:16.362
Oh, thank God, you're all right.
Must have been given such a scare.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.440
What's going on here?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.688
Damon drove a sword into my chest knowing

32:22.880 --> 32:25.121
it would be the same
as driving it into yours.

32:26.680 --> 32:30.844
Of course, he was under the impression
it would kill me.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.771
- What is he talking about?
- DAMON: What difference does it make?

32:36.280 --> 32:37.611
Didn't work anyway.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.045
Take me home, please.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.411
What?

33:03.680 --> 33:05.489
Look who's finally calling me back.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.160
Sorry. I got waylaid
at an impound lot with Enzo,

33:08.360 --> 33:10.044
which was somehow
not even the worst part of my day.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.607
I needed your help, Bon. Instead,
you're ditching my calls to hang out

33:12.840 --> 33:14.569
with a guy who recently
kidnapped your roommate.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.883
Uh, we weren't hanging out. I was helping
him find some sword to kill Julian.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.969
- Where are you? I'll meet you.
- Don't bother.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.924
Tyler and Jeremy actually took my call.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.044
They think they found a way to help
and I'm looking into it.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.246
(SIGHS)

33:38.520 --> 33:40.761
I guess we could both use a drink.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.564
Heard today didn't go so well.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.811
With the sword or with Lily?
'Cause the answer's the same.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.362
So, that's it? You're giving up?

33:51.360 --> 33:55.001
When nine Russians tell you you're drunk,
you lie down.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.288
Lily made her intentions clear.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.651
Good.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.964
You're better off without her.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.041
Come on. You can't honestly say
you're surprised, can you?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.250
You wanted Julian dead.
I wanted to punish Mom.

34:16.440 --> 34:21.128
And I had a way to kill two birds with
one stone. I am never gonna change.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.244
Lily is never gonna change.
And you are never gonna change.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.489
You're never gonna stop straining to find
one tiny speck of redemption in Lily.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.728
And she's never gonna stop
disappointing you.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.121
You're wrong.
You don't know the whole story--

34:33.320 --> 34:35.083
I don't wanna know
the whole story, Stefan.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.931
I don't wanna know any more excuses,
or lies, or anything that tells me

34:38.120 --> 34:41.168
anything other than the way
that I know it went down.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.445
Our mother faked her death,
left her sons behind,

34:44.679 --> 34:48.480
started a new family, and
went out of her way to forget us forever.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.166
That is the only story
that matters, Stefan.

34:54.520 --> 34:59.208
She tossed us aside without any concern
for what would happen to us.

35:00.920 --> 35:05.528
As far as I'm concerned,
she deserves what she gets.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.286
She deserves what she gets.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.326
I don't know about you,
but I could use a warm bath.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.806
What were you doing in the woods
with Lorenzo?

35:35.040 --> 35:38.442
Well, you know me,
never one to resist a sword fight.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.208
Except my life was bound to yours.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.124
I'm also never one to lose.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.765
Julian, this... This isn'tjust red wine
spilled down my shirt.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.083
Darling, you were never in any danger.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.651
Oh, funny how choking on your own blood
makes you feel like it.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.484
We were boys being boys,
fighting for your honor.

36:03.400 --> 36:07.928
If anything it was silly. Well, until one
of your rude, misbehaved sons

36:08.280 --> 36:10.521
showed up and tried to kill us both.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.483
Did you know Valerie was once pregnant
with Stefan's child?

36:17.920 --> 36:20.082
Valerie? No. I did not.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.482
According to my sons, you did know,

36:22.760 --> 36:26.162
and when you found out,
you beat her until she lost the child.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.600
Luv,

36:28.600 --> 36:29.840
you know me.

36:30.320 --> 36:34.530
You know how deeply that I care
about the family that we have built.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.482
And I would do anything
to keep us together.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.526
I would never have done
something so revolting.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.569
Listen to me rambling on.

36:53.960 --> 36:57.931
(SIGHS) You must have been so upset today,
and here I am acting like it was nothing.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.966
It would destroy me if I ever hurt you.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.450
Will you forgive me?

37:12.040 --> 37:13.326
Of course.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.969
I hate to see you in such pain.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.842
I was drunk and not myself.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.211
But the thought of losing you and my sons,

37:42.200 --> 37:44.407
it brought out a rage in me.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.010
I cannot be faulted
for trying to keep my family together.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.206

37:54.520 --> 37:56.204
Will you forgive me?

37:59.800 --> 38:01.484
Of course.

Of course.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.885

38:28.680 --> 38:30.364
I love you, darling.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.242
I would never hurt you.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.684
How far along are you?

38:54.920 --> 38:56.160
RIC: Uh...

38:56.720 --> 38:58.768
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

- And you're certain you're pregnant?
- Why? What's wrong?

39:10.080 --> 39:12.526
Well, I'm not seeing one baby,
let alone two.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.571
- And you're absolutely sure?
- Twins would be hard to miss.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.930
Not hearing any heartbeats either.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.081
I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.125
I'll give you some time alone.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.130
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

39:44.640 --> 39:48.804
I've been so desperate to believe
this was actually possible.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.324
I am really sorry
that I put you through all this.

39:56.560 --> 40:01.487
Honestly, for a second there,
I believed it, too.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.287
I saw the doctor leave.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.802
Well, she just told us
that you were wrong.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.331
Are you sure about that?

40:17.080 --> 40:18.525
What are you doing?

40:23.960 --> 40:25.371
Oh, my God.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.810
- I'm not sure you're qualified--
- Just let her.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.844
It never made any sense to me.
Why the spell pointed directly to you,

40:39.120 --> 40:41.851
but the test came up negative.
And then it hit me.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.488
I cloaked you from Beau to protect you.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.362
Alaric's babies
are the future of the coven.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.524
They would've protected them
in any way they could.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.887
Wait, wait, how is this all possible?

40:54.880 --> 40:56.166
They were cloaked.
