02:24.040 --> 02:27.880
Do it, do it,
do it, do it, do it!

02:27.960 --> 02:29.680
Hey,
stop right there!

02:29.760 --> 02:31.720
Down! Now!

02:39.560 --> 02:41.720
Whoooo!

03:06.280 --> 03:08.760
Getting expelled
from one elite private school!

03:08.840 --> 03:09.960
Hey, it happens.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.120
Getting expelled from two,
that takes talent.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.760
Summer, can you see
why your mother's upset?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.000
I told her months ago
I didn't like it there.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.040
Pardon my French,
but the kids were garbage.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.080
As opposed to the criminals
she spends time with now.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.480
She doesn't even know them.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.160
I know that you are
the only one who got caught.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.920
Maybe it's time you
faced reality Margot,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
school isn't the best
environment for me.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.000
Well you're in luck there

03:32.080 --> 03:33.960
because there's no decent school
that's going to take you.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.920
And to do this to me, now!

03:36.000 --> 03:37.720
Oh did Margot
tell you the good news?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.320
Our award winning
photographer over here

03:39.400 --> 03:42.000
got a gig in the Middle East.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.280
West Asia! It's more accurate
to say West Asia.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
Congratulations.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.880
Thank you.
It's exciting.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.280
I'm sure...

03:50.640 --> 03:52.840
...and what's going
to happen to Summer?

04:05.360 --> 04:06.200
Hello.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.240
Abbie?

04:07.320 --> 04:08.240
Ahh, yeah.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.160
Holy cow Abby,
it's Margot.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
Margot!?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.480
You're still on
the same number?

04:13.560 --> 04:17.080
Yes, same number
at the same house.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.400
How are you?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.120
Good, great,
yeah I mean you know me,

04:21.200 --> 04:23.400
too much on my plate but ahh...

04:24.000 --> 04:24.920
...how's Thommo?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
It's been forever.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.840
About a decade I'd say.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.000
No, has it
really been 10 years?

04:30.080 --> 04:31.480
What do you think you're doing?

04:31.560 --> 04:33.680
Can't put me on a plane
if I don't have any clothes.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.480
Seriously, do not.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.320
Hey! Whoo!

04:40.560 --> 04:42.720
So, you're going
to think I'm crazy

04:42.800 --> 04:46.240
but I need a
huge, huge favour,

04:46.320 --> 04:47.800
and you're the first
person I thought of.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.720
You're the last person
she thought of.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.880
So anyway,
what are you guys up to

04:51.960 --> 04:53.120
for the next couple of months?

04:53.200 --> 04:54.800
Read my lips Margot.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.600
There is no way that I'm going
to live with virtual strangers,

04:58.680 --> 05:01.560
on the other side
of the freaking world.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.360
She looks extremely cool.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.400
Anything look familiar?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.360
I left when I was four,

05:32.440 --> 05:34.280
not a lot of memories
being formed.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.160
Summer darling,
what do you need first?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.600
Food? Shower? Sleep?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.320
I'd settle for a signal.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.360
I have zero bars.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.560
You only get signal
at Reception Point.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.280
Honey, black-shouldered kite.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.200
How do you feel
about bird watching?

05:52.280 --> 05:53.840
It's surprisingly cool.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.920
So there's a big competition
here this weekend, Summer.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.560
That's why Ari couldn't be
out at the airport to meet you.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.720
Are you into surfing?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.680
-Uh-uh.
-Yes!

06:02.760 --> 06:04.880
That's all anybody
talks about in this town.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.000
Things are
about to kick off here

06:30.080 --> 06:32.440
at the Shorehaven Pro Juniors.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.840
Over the next two days,
the very best young surfers

06:34.920 --> 06:37.440
on this circuit will battle
it out as they start their quest

06:37.520 --> 06:39.760
for the selection
on the state team.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.280
The sun's poking through

06:41.360 --> 06:43.720
and Huey has delivered
clean, three foot swells.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.400
So, it is on!

06:47.280 --> 06:48.800
Hey, Marlon.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.160
Sorry about your heat.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.960
Up against Ahmed.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.920
He's definitely going to
smoke you, but no offence.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.600
I mean, you've been
out for a year.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.240
I don't know.
Rehab's been pretty intense.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.600
Heaps of upper body work.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.520
Just, no surfing.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.360
He doesn't know
the break like I do.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.640
But the break's changed, man.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.040
The bank moved.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.840
It works at a high tide now.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.760
Everything's different.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.680
But hey, good luck.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.560
Did we bring any bags?

07:19.640 --> 07:20.880
I put them in the boot.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.160
Ah thanks, love.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.480
With any luck, Ari's
going to be finished

07:25.560 --> 07:27.120
by the time we get
back from the shops.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.640
See you soon.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.160
So, Reception Point.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.400
Big hill,
end of the car park.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.840
I don't know if you remember,

07:35.920 --> 07:37.320
but I used to take
you and Ari there

07:37.400 --> 07:39.160
when you were little
tackers to whale watch.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.400
We can all go together.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.720
Yeah, that sounds great,
but I'm just making some calls.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.640
Back soon.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.160
Sorry! Sorry!

08:15.240 --> 08:16.320
Are you okay?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.240
Maybe...

08:18.320 --> 08:20.400
...if concussion doesn't
take me in the night.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.320
You're American.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.760
Yeah, I've been consigned here,

08:22.840 --> 08:24.760
like an old timey,
British convict.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.800
Staying with this family
I haven't seen since forever.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.800
Wouldn't be the Gibsons?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.520
It's a small town.
Everyone kind of knows everyone.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.480
Well, from what I
can tell so far,

08:35.560 --> 08:38.520
the mum is strung
tighter than a violin.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.280
Daughter's from outer space,

08:40.360 --> 08:41.720
and the dad reminds me
of the homeless men

08:41.800 --> 08:44.240
who talk to pigeons
in Central Park.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.280
Haven't met the son yet,
but on the evidence,

08:46.360 --> 08:48.840
he'll definitely be somewhere
on the loser spectrum.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.720
Definitely.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.720
Attention
heat three, 15 minute warning.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.840
That's me.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.560
I'll see you around, Summer.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.200
Hey, how do you know Ari?

09:06.400 --> 09:07.680
Oh, crap.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.440
The swell
has just picked up

09:12.520 --> 09:15.120
in time for the Boys Under 16.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.160
Heat three is
Casey, Phillips, Ahmed,

09:18.240 --> 09:21.200
and Shorehaven's own,
Ari Gibson.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.280
Gibson's gills are dry
after a year out with injury.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.480
First competition back.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.440
Let's see what he
brings to the party.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.080
Here we go.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.560
Phillips in red,
makes the first move.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.360
This guy has technique to burn.

09:59.440 --> 10:03.920
Gibson in gold, Ahmed in green,
yet to post scores.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.480
Gibson does well,
he's in the right spot.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.200
Ahmed pounces.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.600
Gibson's just wrapped that up
in a bow and given it away.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.080
Gibson's not looking

10:41.160 --> 10:43.000
very comfortable out there.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.760
Hope it's not that injury
troubling him.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.240
So how long you staying?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.400
Well according to my mum,
about six weeks.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.240
According to the flights

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
I'm about to book with
her credit card, 24 hours.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.040
But do the Gibsons
know you're leaving?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.640
No, no, it's one of
those secret evil plans.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.480
That's pretty weird.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.120
Poppy, it's not weird.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.520
It's like the journey she's on.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.960
Anyway, every
second I stand here

11:02.040 --> 11:03.840
is a second I'm not
in New York, so.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.800
Hey, if you're only
staying one night,

11:07.880 --> 11:09.160
there's a party
at Poppy's place.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.960
Bod, she just said
she wants to leave.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.520
It'll be fun.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.640
And Ari can come to.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.480
If he wants.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.560
Oh, I get it.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.280
You're using me to get to him.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.640
No, he's just a really
good friend of ours.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.480
But, he's been keeping
to himself lately.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.120
Well, I'll probably
be super jet lagged,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
but thanks for the invite.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.440
Got to go climb a hill.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.640
Good luck.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.560
If the wind's right,
you should get 4G.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.520
Well, if I never see you guys
again, have amazing lives.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.160
Casey takes off,
upping the speed.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.320
Oh, great precision
on that top turn.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.320
And oh,
sticks the landing.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.800
Let's see what the
judges have to say.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.280
6.8 for Casey.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.800
Puts him into
second place behind Ahmed.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.440
Only the top two surfers
in the heat will advance

12:13.520 --> 12:14.280
to the next round

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
and there's barely a
minute left on the clock.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.400
Gibson with priority, but he
is being very chosey out there.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.560
Looks like he might
let this one go.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.960
But no,

12:45.040 --> 12:48.320
Gibson, the dark horse,
has come to claim it after all.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.040
Gibson's found himself
the best wave of the set,

12:59.120 --> 13:01.080
and he really
needs to nail this.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.920
Do what you need to do?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.120
Totally.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.360
Oh uh Summer,
this is my brother Ari.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.520
Think you're pretty clever,
don't you?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
I have my moments.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.000
Was my room.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.440
Now your room.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.440
Hm.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.360
Rustic.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.080
The bed's more comfy
than it looks

14:06.160 --> 14:07.440
and the sheets are new.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.400
Well not new, but you know,
we washed them.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.400
Oh, actually I was
going to take that down,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.160
but she's actually
a really good surfer.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.120
Bet she's super talented.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.120
Definitely not. We said one
competition and that is it.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.120
I've already missed a year.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.360
If I miss another one,
I'll never catch up.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.680
Half my friends are
already sponsored--

14:34.760 --> 14:35.920
The same friends who
stopped coming around

14:36.000 --> 14:37.320
when you couldn't surf anymore.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.040
Summer?

14:39.120 --> 14:39.960
Go to bed.

14:40.040 --> 14:40.840
What's up?

14:40.920 --> 14:42.920
Mate, why don't we
just keep free-surfing?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.440
All right, keep it simple.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.800
Comps, sponsorship,
all that stuff can wait.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.720
It can't.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.040
If I want a career, it can't.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.120
This is about my future.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.400
Your future is exactly
what we're thinking about.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.520
A whole season of competition is
too much strain for your body.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.520
What's Summer going to do,

14:57.600 --> 14:59.160
just follow you around
from beach to beach?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.320
Why not? She might be into it.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.760
Has anyone thought
that Summer might want

15:02.840 --> 15:04.560
to hang out with me instead?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.400
Summer.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.880
Hey, come on.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.040
Off to bed.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.200
-All right.
-Come on.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.280
Maybe just a quick nap.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.000
We'll sleep on it.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.720
That means no.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.240
It means we'll sleep on it.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.000
Sorry. I'm finished.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.440
Yeah, no rush.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.200
Oi!

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
Wait up.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.520
What are you doing?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.720
Checking out this party,
your friend Bodhi invited me.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.840
You too actually.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.320
Bodhi specifically
said I could come?

16:25.400 --> 16:28.120
Except she wasn't frothing
at the mouth like that.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.480
What about my folks?

16:30.560 --> 16:32.080
Did they say we could?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.560
I don't need permission
from your parents.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.640
But you're a good kid
who does what he's told,

16:36.720 --> 16:39.160
even when his dreams
are being crushed.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.160
So you should stay.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
Just wait, wait.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.840
Let me get some pants.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.120
Oh, okay.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.240
I can work with this.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.440
Okay, thanks.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.240
Because of course you have a
crush on the wannabe influencer.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.840
Oh, you barely know her.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.560
All right, go on then.
Show us your moves.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.480
Summer, you made it!

17:32.560 --> 17:33.480
Amazing.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.720
Hey, hey, yeah.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.080
Hey Ari, sick comeback today.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.080
Nah, I just got lucky
with that last wave and...

17:42.320 --> 17:44.360
Yeah, so that happened.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.120
Hey, I have to
show you something.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.840
Your mum is Margot Torres.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.760
You didn't tell us you're
from surfing royalty.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.680
Don't get too excited.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.040
Anyway, is there anyone
who could give me

17:56.120 --> 17:57.680
a ride to the
airport tomorrow?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.600
The airport?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.000
Pretend you didn't hear that.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.320
No one else from Shorehaven
has ever gotten on the tour.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.600
She's kind of a legend.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.720
And you should
never meet your heroes.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.920
Why do you need to
go to the airport?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.120
To go back to New York, dummy.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.240
So I don't have to follow
you around everywhere.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.280
Anyway, this is a crazy
boring conversation.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.320
Do I need to teach you
people how to party?

18:18.400 --> 18:19.640
Come on.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.320
Can't stay much longer, okay?
I've got finals in the morning.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.440
I don't.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.160
Yo.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.520
Do not try this at home.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.480
Yeah!

19:29.560 --> 19:32.760
Let me hear you!
Come on, let's go!

19:34.520 --> 19:36.720
Yeah, make some noise!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.560
Come on!
Let's go!

19:38.640 --> 19:40.840
Yeah, let's go.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.680
Oi!

19:41.760 --> 19:42.480
What're you doing?

19:42.560 --> 19:43.520
Oh, off the balcony,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.480
into the half pipe and then
finish with a sick 540.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.320
It's easy.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.760
No, it's insane.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.200
Look, if you want to get on
a plane tomorrow, whatever,

19:51.280 --> 19:54.120
but if you break your neck
tonight, I'm grounded for life.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.360
And how would that be different
to your current situation?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.160
Yo!

19:57.240 --> 19:58.960
If she wants to do it man,
let her do it.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.920
Let's go!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.320
Yo, give that back.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.840
I will if you promise
not to jump.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.440
Right now.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.280
Sneaking out on
Summer's first night here,

20:17.360 --> 20:19.800
I can't believe you've
put me in this position.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.440
I'm sorry, you're grounded.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.120
Mum, I'm in
the quarters tomorrow,

20:23.200 --> 20:24.280
I have to be there.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.480
You should've
thought about that

20:25.560 --> 20:26.960
before you snuck out.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.080
Summer's here all by herself,
she doesn't know anyone.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.080
You need to set an example.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.720
I didn't ask her to come.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.240
Well she's
here now, so deal.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.320
Whatever.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.840
I'm going to bed.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.880
Okay, looks like
you've got it covered.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.720
Got a plane to catch.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.440
You're not seriously going
through with it, are you?

21:15.520 --> 21:17.120
Here's the thing, Ari.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.680
I always go through with it.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.320
What about your big
finals thing? Huh?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.160
You're not going?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.200
That's what grounded
usually means.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.080
Just copy and paste
my plan and sneak out.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.880
And being a massive rebel has
worked out so well for you.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.320
At least I don't
just roll over

21:31.400 --> 21:32.800
when something
gets in my way.

21:32.880 --> 21:33.920
At least I try.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.080
Hey Dad?

21:42.160 --> 21:42.920
Shh!

21:43.000 --> 21:45.520
It's a New Holland honeyeater.

21:47.440 --> 21:52.080
Hey um, my shoulder
was hurting yesterday.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.720
I just thought I'd
let you know that

21:55.800 --> 21:59.400
when I finished my heat,
it was hurting.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.480
But then the physio said
it might always hurt,

22:02.560 --> 22:04.880
and that it might just be
something I have to get used to.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.200
I appreciate that.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.560
And I'm sorry that your
mum and I aren't as relaxed

22:12.640 --> 22:14.120
as what we used to be but...

22:15.400 --> 22:18.120
...you almost died
a year ago, mate.

22:18.200 --> 22:18.960
Okay?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.760
You can't expect us to
just forget that and move on.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.400
No, and I don't.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.800
But when I was in hospital
going through rehab,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.440
this is all I thought about.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.080
Getting back in the water,
competing again.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.600
That's what got
me through it.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.040
Awe!

22:40.240 --> 22:41.600
Ah, well.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.200
We did promise you
one comp so,

22:44.280 --> 22:46.760
may as well make
good on it, hey?

23:03.360 --> 23:05.560
Welcome to
finals day people.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.400
Huge day ahead,
so do not leave town.
