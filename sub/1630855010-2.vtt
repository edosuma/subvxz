Evidence?

06:40.076 --> 06:41.109

10:05.643 --> 10:07.976
Help!

10:08.076 --> 10:10.809
Hey, I'm a fucking lawyer.

10:12.976 --> 10:15.009
This woman is under arrest!

10:15.109 --> 10:16.443
Help!

10:24.643 --> 10:26.209
Where are you taking her?

10:27.042 --> 10:28.577
What's your precinct?

10:28.677 --> 10:30.677
What are the charges?

10:30.777 --> 10:32.842
This woman has done nothing,
and they're arresting her.

10:32.942 --> 10:35.376
- What are you doing? Fuck!
- I have it all on camera.

10:35.477 --> 10:37.009
Answer him!

10:37.109 --> 10:38.443
I see you.

10:38.543 --> 10:39.942
We see you!

10:40.042 --> 10:41.242
We see you!

10:41.342 --> 10:42.543
Back off!
We see you!

10:42.643 --> 10:43.743
We see you!

10:43.842 --> 10:45.376
We see you!
- We see you!

10:45.477 --> 10:46.842
We see you!

10:46.942 --> 10:48.276
We can see you!

10:49.577 --> 10:50.610
We see you!

10:50.710 --> 10:52.677
- Are you ready?
- For what?

10:52.776 --> 10:53.976
You're ready enough. Gun! Gun!

10:54.076 --> 10:55.577
They're gonna shoot her!

10:59.776 --> 11:01.909
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

11:04.643 --> 11:06.209
Back the fuck up!

11:14.309 --> 11:15.242
Who the fuck were they?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.510
Oh, drop it already.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.776
- Who are you with?
- Who am I with?

11:17.876 --> 11:19.276
Who are you with?
They were gonna kill me.

11:19.376 --> 11:20.742
- Are you with Arda?
- Are you going to kill me?

11:20.842 --> 11:22.376
Why are people trying
to kill me?

11:22.477 --> 11:24.376
I'm not gonna kill you, okay?
I just want some answers.

11:24.477 --> 11:25.976
What were you doing
on 9th Street yesterday?

11:26.076 --> 11:27.477
What, yesterday? I was at
my fucking job at a meeting.

11:27.477 --> 11:28.976
Right, the homeless
charity thing.

11:29.076 --> 11:31.109
Social justice warrior/lawyer
who knows Krav Maga.

11:31.209 --> 11:33.477
- Not suspicious at all.
- I don't know Krav Maga.

11:33.477 --> 11:34.776
I just took a class

11:34.876 --> 11:36.109
- to strengthen my core.
- Who are you?

11:36.209 --> 11:37.510
I'm nobody. Just let me...

11:37.610 --> 11:39.209
Clearly, whoever is after me
is after you.

11:39.309 --> 11:41.376
So why don't you just tell me
what the fuck is going on?

11:41.477 --> 11:43.909
Clearly, you are the shady one.
You murder people.

11:44.009 --> 11:45.742
I haven't murdered anybody, and
clearly I just saved your life,

11:45.842 --> 11:48.477
- so how about some appreciation?
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

11:48.477 --> 11:49.643
People are trying to kill me.

11:52.076 --> 11:53.776
Stop!

11:53.876 --> 11:55.342
My entire life has
just been blown apart.

11:55.477 --> 11:56.709
Do you understand?
People are dead.

11:56.809 --> 11:57.942
My friend just fucked me over

11:58.042 --> 11:59.510
and jumped off
a fucking building

11:59.610 --> 12:01.477
in front of my very eyes.

12:01.477 --> 12:03.477
I need to know
what's going on and why.

12:03.477 --> 12:05.543
And until I get some answers
about how you and those

12:05.643 --> 12:07.176
fucking assholes
in the blue Mercedes

12:07.276 --> 12:09.342
are mixed up in all this shit,
you're not going anywhere.

12:09.477 --> 12:10.942
You're stuck with me. Got it?

12:11.042 --> 12:13.209
Okay, first off,
nobody tells me what to do!

12:13.309 --> 12:15.176
Nobody. You got it?
And second of all,

12:15.276 --> 12:16.742
thank you for what
you did back there.

12:16.842 --> 12:18.510
The rescue was very clever,

12:18.610 --> 12:19.610
even if it was a little racist.

12:19.709 --> 12:21.176
- Racist?
- Using assumptions about

12:21.276 --> 12:23.009
Black people and the police
to manipulate the crowd,

12:23.109 --> 12:24.942
it was reductive,
and by that measure,

12:25.042 --> 12:26.477
- it was a little racist.
- Oh, my God!

12:26.477 --> 12:28.009
- I just saved your life.
- Stop talking!

12:28.109 --> 12:30.076
I am processing.
I am trying to say,

12:30.176 --> 12:32.342
"I get it. It's okay
that you did that."

12:32.477 --> 12:34.709
But...
Okay, it's just me.

12:34.809 --> 12:36.976
It's just me. It's how
I process. Fight or flight,

12:37.076 --> 12:39.477
which... it's usually fight.
Especially when I'm scared.

12:39.577 --> 12:41.176
And I'm fucking scared, man!

12:41.276 --> 12:42.477
Who were those people?

12:42.477 --> 12:43.942
And what have you
gotten me into?

12:44.042 --> 12:45.142
I don't have time for this.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.376
Blindfold or trunk?

12:46.477 --> 12:47.742
- What?
- I don't want you seeing

12:47.842 --> 12:49.477
where I'm going.
Blindfold or trunk?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.376
Fuck you!

12:51.477 --> 12:53.543
Where are you going?
Hey! Hey!

12:56.309 --> 12:57.742
I don't, I don't need to go
to the hospital, all right?

12:57.842 --> 13:00.109
I-I can go home.

13:00.209 --> 13:01.776
Okay?

13:01.876 --> 13:03.176
My girlfriend's
going to freak out.

13:03.276 --> 13:04.543
She hates hospitals.

13:05.376 --> 13:07.976
Don't worry. We're just going
to check you out.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.610
Hey.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.042
Uh, Jo Madi.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.909
Uh, we met upstairs
in the office.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.276
I know your-- knew your boss.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.876
Yeah. Hi.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.042
Uh, do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

13:27.477 --> 13:29.309
So, um...

13:29.477 --> 13:31.109
Ooh, what happened up there?

13:32.142 --> 13:33.577
It's so hard to remember, it...

13:33.676 --> 13:35.342
Mm.
- Um...

13:35.477 --> 13:36.676
I came back from the food run.

13:36.776 --> 13:38.709
It was just,
it was really sudden.

13:38.809 --> 13:41.776
Right. I mean, were there
other people there?

13:41.876 --> 13:43.577
- Mm-hmm.
- And John Weir?

13:43.676 --> 13:45.042
- Where was he?
- In his office, I think.

13:45.142 --> 13:46.742
You know, somebody said
that they saw someone

13:46.842 --> 13:49.142
who looked like him
standing on the street.

13:49.242 --> 13:51.876
He was definitely there.

13:51.976 --> 13:54.342
I mean, I think. I don't know.

13:54.477 --> 13:57.477
I'm just... I don't know
if it was really Weir.

13:57.477 --> 14:00.477
So, um...

14:00.477 --> 14:02.042
You were just standing there
with everybody and...

14:02.142 --> 14:04.042
- it happened?
- Madi!

14:04.142 --> 14:06.309
- Okay, thanks.
- Madi!

14:07.477 --> 14:08.709
What'd I tell you?

14:08.809 --> 14:11.942
Okay, listen, Rasche,
something is off.

14:12.042 --> 14:13.709
Is this your way of trying
to get back in the field?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.742
You crack the big case
and all is forgiven?

14:15.842 --> 14:16.776
'Cause it doesn't
work like that.

14:16.876 --> 14:18.142
It's weird, Rasche.

14:18.242 --> 14:20.309
I mean, three charred bodies,

14:20.477 --> 14:21.942
and he just gets off
with some scratches?

14:22.042 --> 14:23.942
Well, if you were really
a part of this case,

14:24.042 --> 14:25.309
you would know
that he was found farther

14:25.477 --> 14:26.809
from the epicenter
than they were.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.376
Well, you're going
to run the DNA

14:28.477 --> 14:30.909
for whoever's
in those bags, right?

14:31.009 --> 14:32.477
You are so out of your lane
right now.

14:32.576 --> 14:34.776
No, you can't take anything
at face value with Weir.

14:34.876 --> 14:36.076
He knows how people think.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.576
He's super smart
and he's half crazy.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.042
So that makes him unpredictable.

14:40.142 --> 14:41.876
Yeah, and only you
can solve him.

14:41.976 --> 14:43.909
Are you really so desperate

14:44.009 --> 14:45.676
to get back in that, what,
you're making shit up

14:45.776 --> 14:47.510
- to feel useful?
- No.

14:47.609 --> 14:49.876
No, I'm not.
I know this guy, Rasche.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.276
- I'm telling you.
- Okay.

14:51.376 --> 14:53.909
Fuck you and
your white whale, Madi.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.676
And until Morello signs off,

14:55.776 --> 14:57.342
you don't belong here.
Do you understand?

14:57.477 --> 14:59.076
Come on, man. You're not going
to use any of my

14:59.176 --> 15:00.876
- expertise in this...
- Please. There's your car.

15:00.976 --> 15:02.509
Have yourself a nice day.

15:02.609 --> 15:03.809
You're going to kick me out?

15:03.909 --> 15:05.477
That would be
what I'm doing, yes.

15:07.142 --> 15:08.776
What, you're just going
to watch me walk to my car?

15:08.876 --> 15:11.342
- I'm waiting.
- All right, fine. Fuck you.

15:12.142 --> 15:14.076
You know,
you got a big ego, man.

15:14.176 --> 15:16.477
You know what? You have
yourself a nice fucking day.

15:16.477 --> 15:18.109
We're going to do
real FBI work here.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.376
You go do money FBI.
Oh, yeah. Fuck you.

15:51.276 --> 15:52.742
So, no more me?

15:52.842 --> 15:54.476
No more Johnathan?
Is that what you want?

15:54.476 --> 15:56.542
Because that is
what you're saying.

15:56.642 --> 15:58.176
We can't do this anymore!

16:10.376 --> 16:11.876
<i>I don't expect you to understand</i>

16:11.976 --> 16:14.276
<i>what we're going through,
but you</i>

16:14.376 --> 16:16.976
and your mother
are going to move away.

16:18.242 --> 16:19.876
<i>I may not see you</i>

16:19.976 --> 16:21.376
for a long while.

16:23.809 --> 16:25.809
Don't blame your mother.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.476
♪ ♪

16:33.809 --> 16:36.476
<i>I am sorry it's come to this.</i>

16:37.376 --> 16:39.376
There's just something
I have to do.

16:47.276 --> 16:48.376
Johnathan, it's your turn.

16:48.476 --> 16:49.909
Just take the shovel.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.642
Johnathan, take it.

16:51.742 --> 16:52.709
Just take the shovel.

16:52.809 --> 16:55.309
Johnathan! What are you doing?

17:07.276 --> 17:10.076
No one will
ever know this.

17:10.176 --> 17:12.542
That your father died
fighting for this country.

17:14.042 --> 17:16.609
Those things in the newspapers,

17:16.709 --> 17:18.242
they aren't true.

17:18.342 --> 17:21.576
He did what he did to keep you
and your mother safe.

17:27.209 --> 17:30.109
Fuck!
Are you shitting me with this?

17:30.209 --> 17:31.709
I gave you two options.
You wouldn't choose one.

17:31.809 --> 17:33.276
So I gave them both.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.476
- Where are we?
- Doesn't matter.

17:35.476 --> 17:37.342
We're going to be leaving
soon enough.

17:37.476 --> 17:38.709
Come on. Sit up.

17:38.809 --> 17:39.909
It's all right.

17:40.009 --> 17:41.476
You're all right.

17:44.276 --> 17:45.942
Here, let's sit you down.

17:46.042 --> 17:49.042
There.

17:53.176 --> 17:54.642
This is a straight-up
murder house.

17:54.742 --> 17:57.042
I don't need you or
your commentary right now.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.375
I'm trying to think,
and I'm running out of time.

17:59.476 --> 18:01.076
Time for what?

18:03.776 --> 18:05.642
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:05.742 --> 18:07.209
Really?

18:28.076 --> 18:30.509
Okay. I need to know
who you really are.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.076
I mean it.
So start telling me.

18:33.942 --> 18:35.341
- I told you.
- No. You told me about

18:35.476 --> 18:37.142
your other bullshit.
Everything checked out.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.942
I need you to tell me
what you're not telling me.

18:39.042 --> 18:41.109
You know that
sounds crazy, right?

18:41.209 --> 18:44.476
None of this shit happened
until I met you.

18:44.476 --> 18:45.676
Explain that.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.109
I've looked at this
from every angle.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.209
Okay?
Every possible permutation.

18:50.308 --> 18:51.509
And none of this makes sense.

18:51.609 --> 18:53.476
There's absolutely
no version of you

18:53.476 --> 18:55.076
- that makes sense to me.
- Okay, okay.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.476
I see that you've
been through a lot,

18:56.576 --> 18:59.076
that you've lost friends
and who knows what else,

18:59.176 --> 19:00.676
and I am sorry for that.

19:00.776 --> 19:03.142
But the way I see it,
you brought this down on me.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.976
Not the other way around.

19:06.076 --> 19:07.642
Okay.

19:07.742 --> 19:10.308
The camera in your hotel room
tells me one of two things.

19:10.476 --> 19:11.876
You're either
working for somebody,

19:11.976 --> 19:14.476
or someone's watching you.
Now, for argument's sake,

19:14.476 --> 19:16.476
let's just say you're
the victim in all of this,

19:16.476 --> 19:20.109
and someone's watching you.
I need to know why and who.

19:20.209 --> 19:23.009
That's your proof
that I'm lying?

19:23.109 --> 19:25.076
How do you know
it's not some hotel guy

19:25.176 --> 19:26.642
who's getting his rocks off?

19:26.742 --> 19:28.375
How do you know
that my naked body,

19:28.476 --> 19:30.209
and maybe even yours,
is on the Internet

19:30.308 --> 19:32.076
with Erin Andrews right now?

19:32.176 --> 19:33.275
You're going to need
more proof than that.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.341
Okay, fair enough.

19:35.476 --> 19:38.275
It doesn't explain away
our online hookup.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.476
You saw my phone.
That was you.

19:40.576 --> 19:43.176
I don't use that app.
You honestly think

19:43.275 --> 19:44.341
that I would give
my personal information

19:44.476 --> 19:47.042
to a company to-to meet a woman?

19:47.842 --> 19:50.241
I mean, I haven't
known you that long,

19:50.341 --> 19:52.375
- but you seem pretty lonely.
- I don't use the app.

19:52.476 --> 19:55.609
Well, you have an account.
Explain that.

19:55.709 --> 19:56.642
I can't.

19:56.742 --> 19:58.009
If you didn't make the account,

19:58.109 --> 19:59.275
someone else did.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.375
Just look up
the address they used,

20:01.476 --> 20:03.375
and maybe that'll tell you.

20:03.476 --> 20:06.375
Do you have a computer?

20:11.341 --> 20:13.176
Give me a second.

20:18.742 --> 20:20.142
Okay. You got
15 minutes online.

20:20.241 --> 20:22.009
After that,
I got to pull the plug.

20:22.109 --> 20:24.476
That's weird, but okay.

20:24.576 --> 20:28.142
Um, it's not going
to take that long.

20:28.241 --> 20:30.076
Okay.

20:30.176 --> 20:31.642
That's your username.

20:31.742 --> 20:36.076
And that is the email that is
linked to the account.

20:37.341 --> 20:39.576
Larterland?

20:40.809 --> 20:42.275
Shit.

20:46.142 --> 20:47.142
Oh, you don't have an account,

20:47.241 --> 20:48.476
but now you know
your password?

20:48.576 --> 20:50.042
Larter is someone
who worked with me.

20:50.142 --> 20:52.208
He uses the same stupid
password for everything.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.442
It was them.

20:56.542 --> 20:57.609
Them?

20:57.709 --> 20:59.175
My coworkers.

21:00.076 --> 21:01.576
But why?

21:02.842 --> 21:05.341
Well, just ask them.

21:08.842 --> 21:10.842
I can't.

21:11.842 --> 21:14.175
- I know why.
- What?

21:14.275 --> 21:16.109
They probably
feel bad for you.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.742
Like, like they thought
you were lonely?

21:18.842 --> 21:20.375
No, that's not it.

21:20.476 --> 21:22.642
Ew. Are you some incel guy?

21:22.742 --> 21:24.976
Like sad, sad loner shit?

21:25.076 --> 21:27.476
- Enough.
- Yeah. Uh...

21:27.476 --> 21:29.241
If there's one thing
I'm more willing to believe

21:29.341 --> 21:30.642
than you being
a psycho murderer,

21:30.742 --> 21:32.509
it's that you're,
you're a dateless loser

21:32.609 --> 21:34.141
who needs his friends
to set him up.

21:34.241 --> 21:36.308
That, that makes perfect sense.

21:36.476 --> 21:38.141
Wow, you are
a really funny girl.

21:38.241 --> 21:40.842
Unless lonely
has made you crazy,

21:40.942 --> 21:43.042
and you decided
to kill some Asian dude

21:43.141 --> 21:44.476
because your dog told you to.

21:44.476 --> 21:45.909
Is that really the most
plausible thing

21:46.009 --> 21:47.809
- you can come up with?
- Take it from a lawyer.

21:47.909 --> 21:52.642
Trunk, stalker, spooky-ass
unheated house? Psycho.

21:52.742 --> 21:55.108
I am not some psychotic
killer person, okay?

22:00.175 --> 22:01.642
Seriously?
Homm?

22:07.208 --> 22:08.809
Who is that?

22:08.909 --> 22:11.241
What's going on? Who...?

22:11.341 --> 22:13.776
Isn't that the guy you killed?

22:15.275 --> 22:17.576
See, not a psycho.

22:19.476 --> 22:20.676
I saved his life.

22:20.776 --> 22:23.009
Not that he believes me.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.208
My life?

22:26.009 --> 22:27.809
Maybe you're not
who I thought you were,

22:27.909 --> 22:29.876
which leads me back
to one question.

22:29.976 --> 22:31.976
Yeah, what's that?

22:32.075 --> 22:35.009
Blindfold or trunk?

22:35.108 --> 22:37.141
What the fuck, dude?

22:37.241 --> 22:38.909
I'm sorry, okay?
I am sorry.

22:39.009 --> 22:43.042
People don't take to being put
in trunks, asshole, okay?

22:43.141 --> 22:45.175
- I'll make a note of it.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

22:45.275 --> 22:48.041
Uh-uh!
Do not lay your hands on me.

22:48.141 --> 22:50.075
All right?

22:52.108 --> 22:54.509
A mile and a half up the road,
there's a mini-mart.

22:54.609 --> 22:56.108
Believe it or not,
there's a pay phone.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.942
Are you trying
to tell me something?

22:58.041 --> 22:59.308
I'm letting you go.

22:59.476 --> 23:00.476
Okay? Obviously
this was a big mistake,

23:00.576 --> 23:02.909
so I am letting you go.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.041
You're letting me go?

23:07.141 --> 23:09.375
Coincidence is
the only version of this

23:09.476 --> 23:10.709
that makes any sense.
So, yes,

23:10.809 --> 23:12.476
I'm letting you go,
on one condition.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.108
You never saw me, okay?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.676
I've got all of your personal
information right here.

23:16.776 --> 23:19.709
I can find you anytime I want.
Understand?

23:22.642 --> 23:24.776
You going to cut me loose?

23:24.876 --> 23:26.476
Right.

23:33.976 --> 23:35.108
You know what?

23:35.208 --> 23:37.141
Fuck no.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.876
I'm not going anywhere with
someone trying to kill me.

23:38.976 --> 23:40.141
What?

23:40.241 --> 23:42.476
- I'm not going.
- Don't get back in there.

23:45.476 --> 23:46.876
It's not safe.

23:46.976 --> 23:49.341
You leave me here, I'm telling
the cops everything

23:49.476 --> 23:52.341
about you and the little man
in your basement.

23:52.476 --> 23:53.375
You understand that?

23:53.476 --> 23:55.476
I'm a target now, just like you.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.809
So what am I supposed to?
I'm supposed to go

23:56.909 --> 23:58.776
out into the world
to get myself killed?

23:58.876 --> 24:01.108
You brought this onto me.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.909
You are responsible.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.609
I'm staying with your
tweaky, paranoid self.

24:06.709 --> 24:08.742
And it's not
Stockholm syndrome, asshole.

24:08.842 --> 24:11.576
Okay? Don't get your hopes up.

24:11.676 --> 24:14.241
It's battlefield triage.
I'm a pragmatist.

24:14.341 --> 24:15.942
So start the car.
Go ahead, start it,

24:16.041 --> 24:17.576
start it, start it.
And we're going back

24:17.676 --> 24:18.509
to your spooky-ass house...

24:18.609 --> 24:20.742
...until I know I'm safe.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.709
Patty Hearst had to be
easier than this.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.709
Okay.

24:40.842 --> 24:42.075
Mom.

24:42.175 --> 24:45.509
- Johnathan, I told you...
- I don't want to go.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.676
This is my home.

24:50.175 --> 24:52.375
What about my friends?
I don't want to move...

24:52.476 --> 24:55.476
No more, please, okay?
I understand.

24:55.576 --> 24:57.509
But no more.

24:57.609 --> 24:59.041
- Okay.
- What...

24:59.141 --> 25:01.075
What about Dad?

25:03.375 --> 25:05.676
He needs us.

25:07.108 --> 25:08.308
You need to go get him.

25:08.476 --> 25:10.542
We have to leave, sweetheart.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.975
We have to.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.476
Okay.

25:37.509 --> 25:41.509
Could you stop, please?
It's really annoying.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.742
Body-focused self-soothing.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.842
You mean a tic?

25:50.308 --> 25:51.709
It's a tic.

25:52.609 --> 25:53.908
What are you soothing?

25:54.008 --> 25:56.509
Hmm. We don't have enough time.

25:56.609 --> 26:00.476
How about you, um,
cut these zip ties now?

26:01.509 --> 26:03.008
Still thinking about that.

26:03.108 --> 26:05.576
You got to stop
being so paranoid.

26:05.676 --> 26:08.509
Would you please
just be quiet for a second?

26:08.609 --> 26:09.908
Why?

26:10.008 --> 26:11.776
You know, there's still room
in the trunk.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.742
Oh, go ahead.
Try that again. Go ahead.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.008
There he is.

26:25.476 --> 26:27.875
Oh, is that the guy we're after?

26:27.975 --> 26:29.275
Me, not we.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.609
We are in this together now.

26:30.709 --> 26:32.108
- Remember?
- You said that. I never said

26:32.208 --> 26:34.509
- anything like that.
- Yeah, where am I gonna go?

26:34.609 --> 26:36.375
You need to trust me now.

26:36.476 --> 26:38.375
Trust is a dangerous game.

26:38.476 --> 26:41.141
What kind of bullshit is that?

26:41.241 --> 26:43.141
I don't do trust.

26:45.975 --> 26:48.075
That's no way to live, Weir.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.709
Yeah, right.

27:05.341 --> 27:06.875
Excuse me.

27:06.975 --> 27:09.776
I'm sorry to bother you, but
you see that guy over there?

27:09.875 --> 27:12.808
He's my best friend. Um...

27:12.908 --> 27:15.008
It's his birthday and I wanted
to surprise him.

27:15.108 --> 27:16.742
Wondering if you could
help me out.

27:19.709 --> 27:20.908
Promise you
that it's gonna make

27:21.008 --> 27:22.175
a big difference
to your bottom line.

27:22.275 --> 27:23.941
To all of us.
Thank you very much.

27:24.941 --> 27:27.476
Gentlemen, do you guys know
what you're going to order?

27:27.476 --> 27:28.476
Thank you very much. So...

27:28.576 --> 27:30.476
Oh, my God!

27:30.576 --> 27:32.041
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry, sir.

27:32.141 --> 27:34.642
- It's all right. It's okay.
- I am so, so, so sorry.

27:34.742 --> 27:36.975
- It's just a, just a $700 shirt.
- Oh, my God.

27:37.075 --> 27:38.542
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Gentlemen,

27:38.642 --> 27:39.642
if you'll excuse me,
I'll be right back.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.241
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.375
Goddamn it.

27:46.676 --> 27:48.509
That's gonna need a stain pen.

27:48.609 --> 27:50.175
Jesus Christ. Weir.

27:50.275 --> 27:51.841
Why am I the target?

27:51.941 --> 27:52.975
Weir, you can't be here.

27:53.075 --> 27:54.941
My entire team is dead,

27:55.041 --> 27:56.576
Valence is dead,
and I'm all over the news?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.041
What the fuck
do you know about it?!

27:58.141 --> 27:59.808
I-I don't know shit, all right?

27:59.908 --> 28:01.208
Valence looped me
out of everything.

28:01.308 --> 28:03.008
- He liked it that way.
- Right before he jumped,

28:03.108 --> 28:05.709
he received an email saying,
"Do it now." Who sent it?

28:05.808 --> 28:06.941
- Who sent it?!
- I don't know!

28:07.041 --> 28:08.308
I don't know, I swear to God.

28:08.476 --> 28:10.008
Well, you're gonna help me
figure it out.

28:12.808 --> 28:14.509
I can't do that.

28:14.609 --> 28:15.908
All of his comms
are encrypted.

28:16.008 --> 28:17.375
I don't have
that kind of access.

28:17.476 --> 28:19.642
Bullshit.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.108
I did everything
I was hired to do.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.476
Valence paid me to keep
my team in the dark, I did it.

28:24.476 --> 28:26.476
<i>When he paid me to kill Homm,
I did it.</i>

28:26.576 --> 28:28.008
Problem solved.

28:28.108 --> 28:29.676
You were paid
to not get caught,

28:29.775 --> 28:31.908
- not get seen on camera.
- Fuck off, you moron.

28:32.008 --> 28:34.908
I wasn't caught.
I was set up!

28:38.241 --> 28:41.175
How do I access
Valence's comms data?

28:41.975 --> 28:44.241
Weir, you can't be here, okay?

28:44.341 --> 28:47.241
I'm not going to say a word,
but you got to fucking go.

28:47.341 --> 28:49.075
- We got to put distance.
- Why did they want Homm dead?

28:49.175 --> 28:51.542
- Don't ask me that.
- Well, who ordered the contract?

28:51.642 --> 28:53.141
Who's the client?

28:53.241 --> 28:54.642
These people,
if they knew you were here...

28:54.741 --> 28:57.141
- Who?
- Please.

28:57.975 --> 29:00.141
These people
are dangerous, okay?

29:00.241 --> 29:01.741
They're not the kinds
you want to cross.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.275
Neither am I.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.708
They won't kill you
if I go to the police

29:04.808 --> 29:06.741
and tell them
everything I know, right?

29:06.841 --> 29:09.075
Trust me, you're going
to give me a name.

29:09.175 --> 29:12.741
And so help me God,
I will know if you're lying.

29:12.841 --> 29:15.241
Fuck.

29:17.476 --> 29:19.308
Please don't make me,
'cause he'll know if I...

29:19.476 --> 29:22.308
No one else is here!

29:22.476 --> 29:24.741
- He's everywhere.
- Good.

29:24.841 --> 29:27.041
Then it should be simple.
Tell me how to find him.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.708
I don't know.
I've never seen him.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.476
Nobody's seen him.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.141
Oh.

29:38.908 --> 29:40.141
Last chance.

29:40.241 --> 29:42.141
How do I access
Valence's comms data?

29:42.241 --> 29:44.141
You don't.
Only he could.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.741
Without his password
and his authenticator,

29:46.841 --> 29:48.308
there's no getting in, okay?

29:48.476 --> 29:50.108
Five wrong tries,
the whole server just

29:50.208 --> 29:52.175
bleaches itself.
It's impossible.

29:52.275 --> 29:53.476
Please.
Let me worry about that.

29:53.476 --> 29:54.708
Where's the authenticator?

29:54.808 --> 29:56.008
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

29:56.108 --> 29:56.875
It was in his pocket
when he jumped.

29:56.975 --> 29:58.275
It's fucking gone.

30:03.008 --> 30:05.208
This is the moment
where you forget you saw me.

30:05.308 --> 30:08.041
All right.

30:24.941 --> 30:26.708
One earpiece communicator.

30:27.675 --> 30:30.175
One gun. One wallet.

30:33.341 --> 30:35.408
One key fob.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.341
Babe,

30:43.442 --> 30:44.476
why won't you listen to me?

30:44.575 --> 30:47.641
I'm okay. It's fine.

30:51.008 --> 30:53.509
You should come back
to my place.

30:53.608 --> 30:55.675
Hey, you don't
have anything here.

30:55.775 --> 30:57.675
I can cook for you.

30:58.476 --> 31:00.308
I'm fine.

31:00.476 --> 31:02.509
I'm good, okay?

31:07.975 --> 31:09.841
Imagine if yesterday morning
was the last time

31:09.941 --> 31:12.141
we ever saw each other.

31:13.575 --> 31:15.675
Stop worrying.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.608
All right?

31:21.808 --> 31:24.108
Who's that?

31:28.608 --> 31:31.541
It's...
my boss.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.108
I got to do some, some...

31:33.208 --> 31:35.275
After what just happened?

31:35.375 --> 31:36.476
Seriously?

31:36.476 --> 31:39.108
I'm fine. I'm fine.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.275
All right?

31:40.375 --> 31:43.708
Just go home.
I'll be there soon, okay?

31:43.808 --> 31:46.908
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

32:02.975 --> 32:04.708
Do you really think

32:04.808 --> 32:06.541
you're going to walk in there

32:06.641 --> 32:09.075
and just get whatever it is
you want to get?

32:19.275 --> 32:21.941
Is this you looking at every
angle and permutation?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.275
'Cause I can
tell you right now,

32:23.375 --> 32:25.475
every one of them ends
with you getting busted.

32:25.475 --> 32:27.275
Hands, please.

32:27.375 --> 32:29.241
Come on.

32:29.341 --> 32:30.308
Oh, my...

32:30.475 --> 32:32.475
Is this, is this
really necessary?

32:32.575 --> 32:34.941
I'm afraid... so.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.275
The brain associates

32:42.375 --> 32:45.141
and organizes information
according to context.

32:45.241 --> 32:48.041
So if you change the context
of any given situation,

32:48.141 --> 32:50.508
you can change
how you're perceived.

32:50.608 --> 32:51.908
So what?

32:52.008 --> 32:53.041
The last thing they expect
is a wanted man

32:53.141 --> 32:54.141
to walk into a police station.

32:54.241 --> 32:56.508
So they're not going to notice?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.008
Something like that.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.241
Except this is going
to require a few more cues.

33:00.475 --> 33:02.941
- See ya.
- Well...

33:06.041 --> 33:08.475
What is happening?

33:10.141 --> 33:11.475
He's shopping?

33:18.808 --> 33:20.808
No.

33:21.775 --> 33:23.341
Wow.

33:26.808 --> 33:30.375
Yeah, I'm just about to pass
through security. Hold on.

33:30.475 --> 33:34.008
Thanks. Still there?

33:34.108 --> 33:35.475
Just give him the message. Nope.

33:35.575 --> 33:37.341
Look, I hear you,
but you're not hearing me.

33:37.475 --> 33:39.708
I can't testify at three cases
on the same day

33:39.808 --> 33:41.975
in different buildings.
It's physically impossible.

33:42.075 --> 33:43.475
Yo! Open the door.

33:43.575 --> 33:44.741
- He needs to know I'm here.
- Yeah, I understand,

33:44.841 --> 33:46.575
but that's on the D.A. Not me.

33:46.675 --> 33:47.941
I'll call you back.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.475
- Yo, buzz the door.
- Hold on, will you?

33:49.475 --> 33:51.208
No. You tell her to hold on
and buzz the door.

33:51.308 --> 33:53.041
He needs to know
I'm here. Just go back there.

33:53.141 --> 33:54.108
Hey, you holding me up?
- Come on, guys!

33:54.208 --> 33:56.041
You make me clock in late,

33:56.141 --> 33:58.008
I'm going to get
my desk sergeant down here,

33:58.108 --> 33:59.575
stick his fist up your ass
and use you like a puppet.

33:59.675 --> 34:01.075
- Now open the fucking door.
- Fucking kidding me?

34:01.175 --> 34:02.475
- Open the door!
- Come on!

34:02.575 --> 34:04.075
All right. All right.

34:04.175 --> 34:05.341
Thank you very much.
No, no, no.

34:05.475 --> 34:06.908
You need to listen to me.
This is a matter

34:07.008 --> 34:07.808
- of life and death.
- You need to listen.

34:31.941 --> 34:34.608
<i>Midtown West.</i>
- Investigations.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.141
<i>Hold.</i>

34:36.241 --> 34:37.775
<i>Investigations.</i>
- I'd like to speak

34:37.875 --> 34:39.575
to the lead investigator
of the Valence case.

34:39.675 --> 34:40.975
<i>Please hold.</i>

34:52.575 --> 34:53.808
<i>Connecting you
with Detective Singh.</i>

34:53.908 --> 34:54.875
Thank you.

34:57.208 --> 34:59.041
Yeah? This is Singh.

34:59.141 --> 35:00.841
Uh, hi, I-I...

35:00.941 --> 35:05.575
I work near the building where
that guy was thrown out of,

35:05.675 --> 35:08.575
and I was having lunch
and I think I might have

35:08.675 --> 35:10.775
found something
you'd be interested in.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.508
<i>Oh, yeah? What's that?</i>

35:12.608 --> 35:14.508
Oh, well,
it's hard to explain.

35:14.608 --> 35:16.340
I was hoping I could just
show it to you.

35:16.475 --> 35:19.975
I'm out here in your lobby.

35:20.075 --> 35:22.008
<i>Oh. Great.</i>

35:22.108 --> 35:25.340
<i>I'll be right there.
What's your name?</i>

35:25.475 --> 35:28.741
Billy. Billy Jacks.
I'm in a brown jacket.

35:28.841 --> 35:30.508
<i>Okay, I'll be right there.</i>

35:30.608 --> 35:32.208
Thank you.

35:45.775 --> 35:47.508
Shit.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.675
Skateboard.

36:03.908 --> 36:05.741
Here you go.

36:31.475 --> 36:34.541
Is there a Mr. Jacks here?

36:34.641 --> 36:36.307
Billy Jacks?

36:36.475 --> 36:38.475
- Here you go.
- Hey, thanks, buddy.

36:38.475 --> 36:40.041
Sucks to hear
Singh transferred out.

36:40.141 --> 36:41.975
- She was cute.
- Yeah, I heard.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.575
- Thanks again.
- No problem.

37:00.608 --> 37:02.741
Jesus.

37:05.008 --> 37:07.675
Why did you carry a gun?

37:14.875 --> 37:16.475
Bingo.

37:21.775 --> 37:23.340
Hey!

37:23.475 --> 37:26.108
You want your Post-it?

37:27.841 --> 37:29.641
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

37:34.508 --> 37:37.141
Is there a Mr. Jacks here?

37:39.141 --> 37:41.075
Billy?

37:42.675 --> 37:44.041
Billy Jacks?

37:47.274 --> 37:49.075
Mr. Jacks?

37:49.174 --> 37:50.675
No.

37:51.908 --> 37:54.475
- Oh! [chuckles] Sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.374
Stop!

38:14.008 --> 38:15.508
Whoa!

38:16.641 --> 38:17.741
Shit.

38:18.641 --> 38:20.641
- Who the fuck is that?
- You.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.475
Come on.

38:36.107 --> 38:37.675
What's going on?

38:44.340 --> 38:45.307
Oh, my God.

38:45.475 --> 38:46.775
Who does that?

38:56.841 --> 38:59.475
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:15.941 --> 39:16.908
Oh!

39:17.841 --> 39:19.775
Get-- get up!

39:24.307 --> 39:26.775
Told you I'd get it.

39:31.708 --> 39:33.875
All right,
what the fuck is going on?

41:10.274 --> 41:12.608
Dad? Dad!

41:17.074 --> 41:20.307
♪ ♪

41:45.641 --> 41:47.240
Hey.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.240
What's wrong?

41:53.274 --> 41:55.240
It's just us.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.074
You're okay.

42:02.775 --> 42:03.708
He's not talking, so I'm going

42:03.808 --> 42:06.808
to start cutting
his fingers off.

42:10.007 --> 42:12.808
Oh, you're really messing
this one up, John.

42:13.741 --> 42:16.040
Nice to see you, too, Dad.

42:17.708 --> 42:20.340
Who the fuck is this?
