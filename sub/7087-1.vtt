27:28.690 --> 27:31.214
Joanna. Joanna,

27:31.258 --> 27:33.869
this is
a very special moment.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.349
I would like you
to meet...

27:35.392 --> 27:36.567
Mike Wellington.

27:36.611 --> 27:37.917
My husband.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.005
Oh...

27:39.048 --> 27:40.484
And you must be
the famous Joanna.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.486
You re even prettier
than in the newspapers.

27:42.530 --> 27:43.966
They don t
do you justice.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.794
Excuse me, that woman
is very sick.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.709
Thank you. I should be going
with her.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.450
She ll get all the help
she needs.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.017
Trust me, little lady.

27:56.892 --> 27:59.155
That woman had a seizure,

27:59.199 --> 28:01.767
and she was practically
levitating.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.204
And I have told you
five million times

28:04.247 --> 28:05.161
I phoned Herb.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.294
He said that Sarah is fine.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.992
She just needed some fluids,
just like Mike said.

28:10.036 --> 28:13.692
She was sparking, Walter.She was dancing.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.302
Then why wasn t there
a doctor anywhere?

28:15.345 --> 28:17.652
And why...?Shh. Kids.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.784
[ groans]

28:18.827 --> 28:20.742
[ whispers]:
Why...?

28:21.787 --> 28:22.875
Walter!

28:22.918 --> 28:24.615
Walter!
And why did everyone

28:24.659 --> 28:26.400
just automatically listen
to that Mike person?

28:26.443 --> 28:28.837
And why, why was everyone
just standing there?

28:28.881 --> 28:30.752
You mean why weren t they
just listening to you?

28:30.796 --> 28:34.713
That s not what I m saying!Jesus Christ, Joanna!

28:34.756 --> 28:36.802
What?You were fired,

28:36.845 --> 28:38.238
your kids barely know you,

28:38.281 --> 28:39.718
and our marriage
is falling apart.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.197
Shh!And your whole attitude

28:41.241 --> 28:43.025
makes people
want to kill you.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.941
It makes people
try to kill you.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.421
That s what
we re doing here.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.989
The people in this town
have been nothing

28:50.032 --> 28:53.340
but friendly and welcoming
and wonderful to you.

28:53.383 --> 28:56.212
And you ve been nothing
but snide and suspicious.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.911
And on top of that,
at the picnic you humiliated me.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.521
Well, I can t do it anymore.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.044
I can t keep fighting you

29:02.088 --> 29:05.047
for every inch of everything.
Game over.

29:05.091 --> 29:08.224
Marriage over.Oh, no!

29:08.268 --> 29:09.530
No!

29:09.573 --> 29:10.531
No what?

29:10.574 --> 29:12.228
Please don t go.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.970
Why not?Because you re right.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.583
Wait, I m sorry.
I don t think I heard that.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.498
What did you just say?

29:23.936 --> 29:26.329
I said, you re right.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.896
About?

29:27.940 --> 29:30.769
About everything.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.469
Oh... About me.

30:01.887 --> 30:06.108
Do you know why I signed on
at the network?

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762
Because I thought
that if I was around,

30:07.806 --> 30:10.373
I could help you
lighten up.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.158
You did?

30:12.201 --> 30:14.856
Yeah, I did. What was that
one show called?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.553
I Can Do Everybody?

30:16.597 --> 30:18.642
[ laughs]See, that s what I mean.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.515
I wanted to make you laugh.

30:22.690 --> 30:26.650
That s so sweet,
but I...

30:26.694 --> 30:28.827
I was busy.
I was...

30:28.870 --> 30:31.742
I was running
a network, Walter.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.876
You were so busy that we haven t
made love in over a year.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.835
I know.

30:36.878 --> 30:39.402
Well, I miss you.I...

30:39.446 --> 30:44.930
But I ve always loved you
so much. I...

30:44.973 --> 30:47.715
You know that.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.587
Why?

30:50.631 --> 30:53.982
Because...
Because...

30:54.026 --> 30:56.767
...you re goofy,
and you re...

30:56.811 --> 31:00.206
You re handsome,
and you re... You re...

31:00.249 --> 31:04.253
You re my Walter.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.995
And because when
you play computer chess

31:07.039 --> 31:09.128
you do that little, uh...

31:09.171 --> 31:12.000
You do that little victory
dance. Whoo-whoo.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.959
I do not. I don t do that.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.352
Yes, you do.No, I don t.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.006
Mm-hm.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.401
Ah...

31:21.444 --> 31:24.534
But if I m not
the smartest

31:24.578 --> 31:27.059
and the best of the best
and the most successful,

31:27.102 --> 31:29.888
then I don t know,
who am I?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.151
Do you wanna find out?

31:33.761 --> 31:35.241
How?

31:36.677 --> 31:38.722
First of all,
we re in the country now,

31:38.766 --> 31:40.028
so no more black.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.639
No more black? Are you insane?You heard me.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.859
Only high-powered,
neurotic, castrating,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.774
Manhattan career bitches
wear black.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.210
Is that what you wanna be?

31:48.254 --> 31:51.692
Ever since
I was a little girl.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.564
[ sighs]

31:55.696 --> 31:58.568
Do I really look okay?

32:00.614 --> 32:01.963
Can I be honest?

32:02.007 --> 32:03.138
Mm-hm.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.748
You look kind of
like Betty Crocker.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.185
I know.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.230
At Betty Ford.ELECTRONIC VOICE: We need milk.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.754
We need milk. We need milk. Thank you.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.496
Look, I m trying to make
an effort to change.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.108
I mean, last night my husband
was a different person.

32:16.151 --> 32:19.589
He was strong, he was forceful,
he was commanding.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.200
Like your refrigerator.

32:21.243 --> 32:23.985
Well, nobody said it was gonna
be easy being a homemaker

32:24.029 --> 32:25.856
and a stay-at-home mom.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.337
It s the toughest job
in the world, right?

32:28.381 --> 32:30.557
Well, that may be,
but these Stepford women,

32:30.600 --> 32:31.993
they re a whole
other dimension.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.168
Oh, like yesterday,

32:33.212 --> 32:35.692
that poor lady,
Sarah Sunderson.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.477
Walter said she s fine.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.914
But you said she was shooting
off sparks from her ears.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.002
Now, that s the first sign.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.525
Of what?Cheap jewelry.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.616
We should go see her.Why?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.792
Because we need to be
supportive.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.230
That s how people behave
outside of Manhattan.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.840
They care about each other.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.494
I mean, if you were in New York

32:54.537 --> 32:56.322
and one of your neighbors
got sick, what would you do?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.280
We d call her.To see if she was gonna die.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.629
So we could get the apartment.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.981
Let s go. Hm?

to clean?

35:50.060 --> 35:51.801
But, darling,
her home is spotless.

And she s having
incredible sex

in the middle of the day
with her husband.

35:56.719 --> 35:57.807
Well, I m sorry,

35:57.851 --> 35:59.592
but my shrink says
I need creative chaos.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.159
My therapist says
I need boundaries.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.464
My doctor
said I need

36:02.508 --> 36:04.074
enough electricity
to jumpstart Vegas.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.163
Whoo!

36:05.206 --> 36:06.164
You ever done Zoloft?

I m old-fashioned.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.571
Hey, is there something
that you need to tell us?

36:22.615 --> 36:23.485
Well...

36:23.529 --> 36:25.357
Sharing.
Mm-hm.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.447
Okay. Okay.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.929
Jerry and I have been
in couple s counseling...

36:32.973 --> 36:35.149
for over a year...

36:35.193 --> 36:36.498
and finally...

36:36.542 --> 36:38.021
Finally I just couldn t
take it anymore.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.242
I howled, "You ve become
a gay Republican."

36:41.286 --> 36:44.332
And he said,
"What s wrong with that?"

36:44.376 --> 36:45.899
I said,
"What s wrong with that?

36:45.942 --> 36:48.597
That s like wanting to be gay
with a bad haircut."

36:48.641 --> 36:50.120
Exactly.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.993
So the counselor suggested
that we move to the burbs.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.212
To find a balance.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.214
We moved here
as a last resort.

this is unthinkable,

learn how to be happy...

37:06.833 --> 37:10.706
without Paxil
or compulsive overeating?

37:10.750 --> 37:14.362

this whole thing a try for real,

Wait, a real, real lady?
Are you a human being?

01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:40.808
Yes, and I may very well be

01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:42.854

human being left.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.552

01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:49.774
All of this, Mike,
the wives, Stepford,

01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:51.428
this was all your idea?

01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:54.866
Yes. All I wanted
was a better world.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.433
A world where men were men

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:59.523
and women
were cherished and lovely.

The perfect man.

01:22:26.811 --> 01:22:29.683
And all I wanted was
to make you, all of you...

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.990
into perfect women.

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:34.993
We don t need to be perfect.

01:22:35.037 --> 01:22:36.821
How could you do this to us?

01:22:36.864 --> 01:22:38.954
Because I was just like you.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:41.347
Overstressed, overbooked,
under-loved.

01:22:41.391 --> 01:22:45.047
I was the world s foremost
brain surgeon

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:46.787
and genetic engineer.

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.615
I had top-secret contracts

01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:51.662
with the Pentagon,
Apple and Mattel.

01:22:51.705 --> 01:22:53.011
I was driven.

01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:54.534
Exhausted.

01:22:54.578 --> 01:22:58.321
Until late one night,
I came home to find...

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.541
...Mike.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:06.111

It was all so...

01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:22.388
...ugly.

01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:25.348
Then early the next morning,

01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:28.307
as I gazed across
the breakfast table

01:23:28.351 --> 01:23:32.094
at their lifeless bodies,
I thought...

01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:34.661
"What have I done?"

01:23:34.705 --> 01:23:37.142
But more importantly...

01:23:37.186 --> 01:23:40.276
what I could do to make
the world more beautiful?

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:42.278
I had the skills.

01:23:42.321 --> 01:23:46.151
But I needed help
to realize my larger vision.

01:23:46.195 --> 01:23:47.631
And so I made...

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.461
...Mike.

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:54.594
Because he was someone
other men would listen to.

01:23:54.638 --> 01:23:57.206
And then I asked myself,

01:23:57.249 --> 01:24:01.253
"Where would people never notice
a town full of robots?

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:13.874
before quality time,

01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:17.835
before women were turning
themselves into robots.

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:22.579

change the men too?
