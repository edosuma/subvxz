00:02.735 --> 00:03.630
You taking up tennis?

00:03.730 --> 00:04.986
No, it's *** fly swatter.

00:05.198 --> 00:06.636
- I want to see it work.
- Well, we need a fly.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.503
I've been waiting whole morning.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.548
Did you honestly just kill one?

00:10.585 --> 00:12.820
Hey, what's going on, guys?
Ooh! Ah!

00:12.854 --> 00:14.404
Walk with dignity, you giant toddler.

00:14.539 --> 00:17.224
Come on, Schmidt, you got to get
this stuff out of here, man.

00:17.258 --> 00:19.059
Yeah, well, I can't afford
storage. All my money's tied up

00:19.093 --> 00:21.261
in the storefront
I leased for Jess' sister.

00:21.296 --> 00:24.231
So why don't you put your junk
in the storefront, Schmidt?

00:24.265 --> 00:25.732
You really want me
to put an Ian Schrager rug

00:25.767 --> 00:27.501
in a room
without climate control?

00:27.535 --> 00:28.450
What?

00:28.609 --> 00:30.237
Oh, he was the guy in <i>Star Wars.</i>

00:30.271 --> 00:32.171
Medium talent.

00:32.207 --> 00:33.536
- Hey, guys. Morning.
- Hey, Jess.

00:33.695 --> 00:34.590
Hey.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.910
Come on, Coach! Let's hustle!

00:36.945 --> 00:39.546
I got Coach a job at the school,
and it's his first day.

00:40.682 --> 00:41.782
I don't like kids,

00:41.816 --> 00:43.150
I don't like teaching,

00:43.184 --> 00:44.852
I just like paychecks.

00:44.886 --> 00:46.353
Jess:
Well, I think you're gonna love it.

00:46.387 --> 00:47.988
I don't think I'm gonna love it.

00:49.591 --> 00:54.261
Run! Do not stop running or I
will eat your faces and bodies!

00:54.295 --> 00:57.297
Keep running
or I will murder your family!

00:58.333 --> 01:00.701
(quietly):
I love this job.

01:00.735 --> 01:02.302
You're pissing me off!
This one.

01:02.337 --> 01:04.203
This one. I got my eye on you.

You think I'm in the caboose of life?

You love it in the caboose, not me.

01:38.206 --> 01:40.040
- I really like that lamp.

01:40.074 --> 01:42.075
You like the lamp? I'm sorry.
You know what, it just...

01:42.110 --> 01:44.344
It's just that... It doesn't...
It doesn't feel like a store yet

Uh, pretty much everything's
100% full price.

01:55.171 --> 01:58.191
What you're doing is illegal.
You can't say this is a store.

01:58.226 --> 01:59.826
Schmidt: I'm not taking advice
from you. You pronounce

01:59.861 --> 02:00.928
the "G" in "lasagna."

02:12.407 --> 02:14.675
Winston! Quiet.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.843
So, I have Jamal Chambers
in my fourth period,

02:16.878 --> 02:18.912
and he cannot stop
talking about how fun

02:18.947 --> 02:21.915
and enthusiastic
his new volleyball coach was.

02:21.950 --> 02:23.684
You were right. I love this job.

02:23.718 --> 02:25.519
I knew it. I knew you'd love it.

02:25.553 --> 02:27.421
- Hey.
- I was looking for you.

02:27.455 --> 02:30.090
You weren't in my car.
Internet's down.

02:30.124 --> 02:31.925
Okay, um, well, I
rebooted the router.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.261
You're actually
on the wrong IP address, so...

02:34.295 --> 02:35.295
There you go.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.324
Ooh.

02:36.496 --> 02:39.566
You know I can see everything
that you search for, right?

02:39.601 --> 02:42.703
I'm a biology teacher.
It's all research.

02:42.737 --> 02:44.030
Fixing computers and stuff now?

02:44.211 --> 02:46.265
I'm just taking on
a little extra responsibility

02:46.300 --> 02:48.275
around here, just getting stuff
done that needs doing.

02:50.144 --> 02:52.713
Graffiti's wrong, kids.
Don't do it.

02:52.747 --> 02:54.314
I love corn on the cob, too,

02:54.349 --> 02:56.416
but I'm not gonna paint it
all over the walls.

02:56.451 --> 02:58.819
I'm just hoping, you know,
in a few years

02:58.853 --> 03:00.454
I'll have enough
experience that Dr. Foster

03:00.488 --> 03:03.323
will consider me
for vice principal.

03:03.358 --> 03:04.884
Why don't you just ask him for it?

03:04.998 --> 03:07.127
You can't just ask for a promotion.
You know.

03:07.161 --> 03:11.064
You have to earn the promotion
with years of good work.

03:11.099 --> 03:12.399
(laughing)

03:12.433 --> 03:14.768
What's funny?

03:14.802 --> 03:17.804
Uh, how's that working out
for you, Jess?

03:21.209 --> 03:23.243
Do you see this volleyball?

03:23.277 --> 03:25.846
It won't get over the net
just because you want it to

03:25.880 --> 03:27.981
and you hope someone will notice
that you want it to.

03:28.016 --> 03:30.417
- Okay.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time:

03:30.451 --> 03:34.921
What... do you... want?

03:34.956 --> 03:36.857
Um, I want to be vice principal.

03:36.891 --> 03:38.291
All right.
Then spike that ball, Jess.

03:38.326 --> 03:41.194
Oh, that's not...
Okay, um...

03:41.229 --> 03:43.196
- You got to spike! You got to spike!
- Is that really... Yeah. Okay.

03:43.231 --> 03:45.039
- No, wait. I'm not very good...
- Spike it!

03:45.079 --> 03:46.960
I've just never really been good
with athlete balls.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.640
- Spike it! What do you want?!
- I want to be vice principal.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.117
Spike the ball
and tell me what you want!

03:51.157 --> 03:53.598
I want to be the vice principal!

03:53.633 --> 03:55.676
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:55.710 --> 03:57.310
Oh! Oh...
Oh!

03:57.345 --> 03:59.179
Oh...

03:59.213 --> 04:00.681
I will not laugh.

04:00.715 --> 04:02.683
An outrage! Been all over

04:02.717 --> 04:04.518
and I can't afford anybody.
Unbelievable.

04:04.552 --> 04:06.219
Access to premium
legal counsel should be

04:06.254 --> 04:08.989
every Jew's birthright.
And the jury will see

04:09.023 --> 04:11.024
that there is no justice
for the Hebrew man.

04:11.059 --> 04:13.660
Not in these so-called United States.

04:13.695 --> 04:14.592
What is that that you're doing?

04:14.782 --> 04:16.872
I can't get enough
of this legal drama.

04:16.906 --> 04:18.899
Check this out.
Favorite author, Grisham.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.333
Favorite TV show, <i>Judging Amy.</i>

Favorite color, courtroom brown.

04:23.337 --> 04:26.073
Courtroom Brown. Damn,
I wish that was my nickname.

04:26.107 --> 04:27.512
Did you just think of that?
'Cause it was perfect, man.

04:27.676 --> 04:30.177
- Courtroom Brown.
- Dude, you're a born Courtroom Brown.

04:30.211 --> 04:32.312
That's me. When you say
"Courtroom Brown," I respond.

04:32.346 --> 04:33.947
Hey, Winston.

04:33.981 --> 04:35.182
- Hey, Courtroom Brown.
- Yes?

04:35.216 --> 04:36.717
(whoops, laughing)

04:36.751 --> 04:39.086
Kill 'em, Courtroom!
That's awesome!

04:39.120 --> 04:40.520
What am I supposed to do
in this situation,

04:40.555 --> 04:42.355
represent myself like some nut job?

04:42.390 --> 04:43.824
Nick could be your lawyer.

04:43.858 --> 04:45.992
This Nick? Vivica A. Dropout?

04:46.027 --> 04:47.394
First of all, I don't
want to be involved,

04:47.428 --> 04:49.563
but thank you, Courtroom Brown.

04:49.597 --> 04:51.331
And second of all, I passed
the bar, which means

04:51.365 --> 04:53.499
I can practice in the
state of California.

04:53.539 --> 04:55.936
Oh, Nick, you would be the worst
in the whole entire world.

04:55.970 --> 04:57.204
No offense. I love you, dawg.

04:57.238 --> 04:59.172
I could be your lawyer easy.

04:59.207 --> 05:01.908
You don't forget how to be a
lawyer. It's like riding a bike.

05:03.144 --> 05:06.279
They've changed these!

05:06.314 --> 05:07.781
Fine. I forgot
how to ride a bike.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.950
But I'm not gonna forget
how to be a lawyer.

05:09.984 --> 05:12.919
I guess I have no choice.
You can be my lawyer, Nick.

05:12.954 --> 05:14.149
- I won't do it.
- What?

05:14.263 --> 05:15.889
I value myself too great for that.

05:15.923 --> 05:17.190
If you want me
to be your lawyer,

05:17.225 --> 05:19.593
if you want to win this case,
you must start

05:19.627 --> 05:21.228
with the word "please."

05:21.262 --> 05:23.597
And I'll need a symbolic
five-dollar retainer.

05:23.631 --> 05:24.865
Four dollars.

05:24.899 --> 05:27.033
Skin it. Let's do it. Hooah.

05:27.068 --> 05:30.103
Dr. Foster, I am young, I'm energetic

05:30.138 --> 05:33.540
and I think it's about time
you take advantage of me!

05:33.574 --> 05:36.777
Well, this is... a little awkward.

05:36.811 --> 05:39.980
I'm, uh... I'm exclusively
into Asian women.

05:40.014 --> 05:42.048
It's really a Kristi Yamaguchi thing.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.551
- After Lillehammer...
- I really meant professionally.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.257
I want you to take
advantage of me like that.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.945
- Sorry.
- It's a professional thing.

05:48.107 --> 05:50.290
- Okay. Sorry.
- I want to be vice principal.

05:50.324 --> 05:53.160
Frank retired, you need
someone. I deserve it.

05:53.194 --> 05:55.295
I bust my ass for this school.

05:55.329 --> 05:57.597
You've got it. The job is yours.

05:57.632 --> 05:59.399
- It is?
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

05:59.433 --> 06:01.735
I thought I was gonna have
to force somebody into it.

06:01.769 --> 06:03.603
This is so much easier.

06:03.638 --> 06:04.805
- Really?
- Go ahead.

06:04.839 --> 06:08.642
Be vice principal.
(chuckles)

06:08.676 --> 06:10.510
- I can't believe this.
- In fact, I think

06:10.545 --> 06:11.812
you should start right now.

06:11.846 --> 06:14.214
You will not be sorry, sir.

06:15.550 --> 06:16.783
Did you?

06:16.818 --> 06:18.852
- I got the job! Yeah!
- Oh!

06:18.886 --> 06:20.487
- I spiked the ball.
- Time to celebrate.

06:20.521 --> 06:21.822
No! No! I'm not doing that!

06:21.856 --> 06:23.590
- No!
- We got to celebrate! Celebrate!

06:23.624 --> 06:25.859
Let me pour it on your face
and your clothes and your hair!

06:29.830 --> 06:31.698
Yeah. Uh... looks standard.

06:31.732 --> 06:33.499
Yeah.

06:33.534 --> 06:35.902
You're definitely being sued.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.171
Uh, your deposition is tomorrow.

06:38.205 --> 06:39.839
What-what do we do now?
Do we prep for the plaintiff?

06:39.874 --> 06:41.174
I don't like prepping.
It makes me feel nervous.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.976
I feel boxed in.
And I'm very quick

06:43.010 --> 06:46.045
- on my, uh...
- Sure.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.248
Did you just forget the word "feet"?

06:48.282 --> 06:50.416
Feet. Yeah.
Nick, you should really prep.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.752
Fair enough.
Winston, you're my plaintiff.

06:52.786 --> 06:54.687
Done deal. Okay.
(chuckles)

06:54.722 --> 06:57.690
(clears throat)
Hi, my name is Tim Baker.

06:57.725 --> 07:01.361
I live
at 522 Dugan Court Terrace.

07:01.395 --> 07:04.030
Okay, Mr. Baker,
how long have you been a chef?

07:04.064 --> 07:05.398
I don't have to answer that.

07:05.432 --> 07:06.900
You actually do though, Winston.

07:07.701 --> 07:09.035
Doesn't he?

07:10.237 --> 07:12.372
You ask...
Why you asking me, man?

07:12.406 --> 07:13.610
- No, I'm not. I'm... Yeah.
- You're the lawyer.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.175
No, I know. You have to answer.
(stammers) How long you been a chef?

07:16.210 --> 07:17.911
I already answered that
during background.

07:17.945 --> 07:20.179
What in the hell?
You did background without me?

07:20.214 --> 07:22.215
Why wasn't I invited for background?

07:22.249 --> 07:24.050
You have to answer it!
How long you been a chef?!

07:24.084 --> 07:25.118
You're fired!

07:26.987 --> 07:30.657
Give me another chance.

07:30.691 --> 07:33.426
No!

07:33.460 --> 07:36.296
Okay, here's something.
Get on a plane with me.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.798
While you think about it,
put this on my card.

07:38.832 --> 07:41.267
(whispers):
It's the black one.

07:43.270 --> 07:45.004
(whistles)

07:45.039 --> 07:46.706
Wow. That just happened.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.975
You think maybe we
should take his card

07:49.009 --> 07:50.476
and buy him a new shirt?

07:50.511 --> 07:52.111
(laughs)
I'm scared he'd want

07:52.146 --> 07:53.746
to change it in front of us.

07:54.782 --> 07:55.648
I'm Cece.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.216
Hi, Cece. I'm Buster.

07:57.251 --> 07:58.785
I really hope that's a nickname.

07:58.819 --> 07:59.953
No, it's not a nickname.

07:59.987 --> 08:01.054
It's your real name?

08:01.088 --> 08:02.422
I was bullied pretty bad.

08:02.456 --> 08:03.589
Hi, Buster.

08:03.624 --> 08:04.536
All right, hold on.

08:04.722 --> 08:07.260
- I've got quite an eye for young boys.
- Oh, God.

08:07.294 --> 08:09.262
That's right, I said it.
It's not a typo.

08:09.296 --> 08:10.430
Let's see some I.D.

08:11.765 --> 08:12.732
God, you're handsome.

08:12.766 --> 08:14.267
Cece: I'm sorry.

08:14.301 --> 08:15.601
Wyoming!

08:15.636 --> 08:16.502
- Look at that.
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.937
Wyoming. So you're one

08:17.972 --> 08:20.573
- of the three people from Wyoming.
- Yeah.

08:20.607 --> 08:24.410
Cowboy state, big sky country,
home of the Liberty Bell.

08:24.445 --> 08:26.779
Bull... snatch.

08:26.814 --> 08:28.314
Mike: That's an awful accent.

08:28.349 --> 08:29.515
What is your real accent?

08:29.550 --> 08:31.084
Are you Australian or from Heaven?

08:31.118 --> 08:32.552
How old are you, for real?

08:32.586 --> 08:34.587
- Leave him alone.
- Don't bull-snatch a bull-snatcher.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.856
Leave him alone.
You're over 21, right?

08:38.058 --> 08:39.092
I'm not.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.294
Um... I'm 20.

08:41.328 --> 08:43.796
Mike: Get out of here,
you delicious bastard.

08:43.831 --> 08:46.099
- Can I get my I.D. back?
- No, of course not, you can't.

08:46.133 --> 08:48.368
It'd be against the law,
you... wonderful creature.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.769
Nice to meet you, Cece.

08:49.803 --> 08:51.871
Good God, you look nice.

08:51.905 --> 08:54.107
Nothing irks me like
underage drinking.

08:54.141 --> 08:56.476
It's stupid, it's dangerous,
it's irresponsible.

08:56.510 --> 09:00.146
God, I want to have sex with that kid
so bad, it's freaking me out!

09:00.180 --> 09:01.748
(sighs): Oh. I'm real tingly.

09:03.283 --> 09:05.551
Jess:
<i>We have talk about the budget.</i>

09:05.586 --> 09:07.854
There's a problem with the budget?
But it's due Monday.

09:07.888 --> 09:09.856
- Yeah.
- Do we have too much money?

09:09.890 --> 09:11.891
- No.
- We need to fire people.

09:11.925 --> 09:15.161
- What?
- And when I say "we," I mean you.

09:15.195 --> 09:17.163
Start with the most recent hires.

09:17.197 --> 09:20.033
Well, we have, um... Janet
from the history department.

09:20.067 --> 09:22.068
(exhales)
Human garbage.

09:22.102 --> 09:23.403
Okay.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.637
Ernie, uh...

09:24.671 --> 09:25.638
Ah, yeah.

09:25.672 --> 09:26.739
No. That's Coach.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.374
No. No. No.

09:28.409 --> 09:30.098
No, he's very good at his job.

09:30.256 --> 09:33.079
Last one in, first one out.
You know how this works.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.314
- That's just wrong.
- This is the job, Ms. Day.

09:35.349 --> 09:38.017
He's my friend. I can't. No. I'm not
doing it. I'm not firing Coach.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.819
This is the job, Ms. Day.

09:39.853 --> 09:42.021
Do you want it or not?

09:46.026 --> 09:47.026
I'm what?

09:47.061 --> 09:48.494
We had to do budget cuts,

09:48.529 --> 09:50.163
and we have to let two people go,

09:50.197 --> 09:52.665
and you're my friend,
and I couldn't stop it.

09:52.699 --> 09:53.766
I'm so sorry.

09:55.736 --> 09:57.970
(sighs)

09:58.939 --> 10:00.573
We all pitched in.

10:00.607 --> 10:02.308
Thanks, guys,

10:02.342 --> 10:05.845
I'm not coach anymore.
I'm just Coach.

10:05.879 --> 10:08.481
- What?
- What?

10:11.518 --> 10:13.786
(Coach crying)

10:13.821 --> 10:15.955
(groaning)

10:18.358 --> 10:20.359
(Coach humming sadly)

10:25.015 --> 10:26.257
Morning, Winston.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.430
Are you not talking to me?

10:32.464 --> 10:36.768
Look, I had to fire Coach for my job.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.469
I didn't want to.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.939
Don't squint at me.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.874
Don't do that.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.643
I did it for my job.
It wasn't my choice.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.046
- Hey, Nick, what's up, man?
- What's up, Winnie?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.515
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.550
- Can we talk for a second?
- Can I talk to you?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.986
Schmidt fired me, and now
I'll never get to use

10:55.020 --> 10:57.355
this briefcase I just
bought, and it was $19!

10:57.389 --> 10:59.123
- I think my thing is a little bit more...
- Do you think

10:59.158 --> 11:01.125
I'm sexier when I hold it
or when it's down?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.394
'Cause I think it's kind of sexier
when I hold it, like this.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.331
- Not really.
- Do I look like a man of power?

11:06.365 --> 11:08.032
Imagine this:
It's, like, a rainy day,

11:08.067 --> 11:09.801
I'm on the streets of New York,

11:09.835 --> 11:13.304
(whistles) Hey!
Stop that cab!

11:13.339 --> 11:16.207
I'm a businessman.
I'm late to an important meeting.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.499
I honestly feel like
I would've been so good at this.

11:18.685 --> 11:21.012
You don't want to be a lawyer.
Why do you care whether

11:21.046 --> 11:22.146
- Schmidt fired you or not?
- I spent

11:22.181 --> 11:24.015
all those years at law school

11:24.049 --> 11:25.617
with those preppy dicks...

11:25.651 --> 11:27.796
and I never got
to prove them wrong, Jess.

11:27.846 --> 11:29.721
Okay, go after what you want.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.389
Just make sure that

11:31.423 --> 11:33.024
what you want...

11:33.058 --> 11:36.261
doesn't make you a
cog on the wheel

11:36.295 --> 11:39.163
- of a larger, flawed system.
- Stop it.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.698
Shut your mouth.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.300
'Cause what you're
saying is beautiful.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.936
I'm gonna go put on my power suit.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.604
High and loud, girl. Whoo!

11:46.639 --> 11:47.739
Um...

11:47.773 --> 11:48.740
Good talk, Nick.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.174
With this thing, I feel so sexy,

11:50.209 --> 11:51.943
(chuckles): It's disgusting.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.444
- I think you misunderstood...
- Whoo!

11:56.615 --> 11:58.950
- Your representation running late?
- Uh, no.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.535
Actually, I'll be representing
myself today.

12:00.718 --> 12:01.529
Sorry we're late.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.955
- What?
- This building is a total mess.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.190
Nick Miller of, uh, Cooper,
Bishop and Furguson.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.627
As you know, my boss and senior
partner, Mr. Winston Furguson.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.795
Winston: Gentlemen, pleased
to be with you. Please, please

12:10.829 --> 12:12.764
don't get up, don't get up.

12:12.798 --> 12:13.898
Winston: I-I insist.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.801
Madam Secretary.

12:16.835 --> 12:18.603
- What are you doing here?
- I'm representing you.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.238
- Everything all right?
- I'm a bit caught off guard.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.773
I wasn't expecting these two

12:21.807 --> 12:23.374
very real lawyers to show up today.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.109
Well, we wanted to
let you know that

12:25.144 --> 12:27.445
the entire firm is standing
behind you. Besides,

12:27.479 --> 12:29.614
whether I sit in my office
or in here...

12:29.648 --> 12:32.250
it's all billable.
Am I right, gentlemen? (laughs)

12:32.284 --> 12:33.584
(laughter)

12:33.619 --> 12:36.821
Shall we get into this,
or just take our pants off?

12:36.855 --> 12:38.189
(Nick laughs briefly)

12:39.425 --> 12:41.292
(slapping)
(quietly): Ask him a question.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.194
- Let me... Let me do my thing.
- Do your thing.

12:43.228 --> 12:44.662
(clears throat)
Mr. Baker.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.930
Yes?

12:48.968 --> 12:51.102
What's your home address?

12:51.136 --> 12:53.104
522 Dugan Court Terrace.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.339
Okay.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.240
(clears throat softly)

12:56.275 --> 12:58.743
Uh, no... no further questions.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.478
What?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.648
- Keep going.
- Ow!

13:03.682 --> 13:05.416
Schmidt:
Just keep going. What are you...

13:05.451 --> 13:07.185
<i>Don't hit me. What are
you hitting me for?</i>

13:07.219 --> 13:09.520
- Is everything all right?
- Sure it is. The meter's running.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.055
(laughter)

13:13.158 --> 13:15.526
Even though you don't work
at Coolidge anymore,

13:15.561 --> 13:17.929
you'll still be Coach
Coach to those kids.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.464
It's Coach Coach.

13:19.498 --> 13:20.965
Yeah, Coach Coach.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.767
- Coach Coach.
- Coach Coa...

13:22.801 --> 13:24.168
- Coach Coach.
- I'm sorry.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.770
(sighs)
It's all good, Jess.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.106
You did what you had to do.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.208
I'm proud of you for that, okay?

13:30.242 --> 13:33.211
- Yeah.
- I hope I'm the first of many you fire.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.545
That really means a lot to me.

13:35.812 --> 13:36.948
I am gonna miss those kids, though.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.783
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm gonna miss.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.451
Those little...
those little bastards.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.986
Little Ronnie.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.288
Ronnie's so clumsy and slow.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.357
- Yeah.
- Thomas.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.594
I mean, he's strong, but that
boy is a classic middle child.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.864
He's just looking for love,
up, back and sideways.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.165
(wry laugh)

13:54.199 --> 13:57.001
(voice breaks):
And Maurice.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.187
(quiet sob)

13:58.590 --> 14:00.838
He always makes a mess
whenever he eats a Popsicle.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.206
It's, like, dude,

14:02.241 --> 14:03.908
stop sucking
your Popsicle like that, man.

14:03.942 --> 14:05.810
You're never gonna get
a girlfriend like that.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.311
(sobbing)

14:07.346 --> 14:08.646
(quietly):
And then there's Hunter.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.914
God...

14:09.948 --> 14:12.984
Fat... cross-eyed...

14:13.018 --> 14:14.719
clod-hopping Hunter.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.055
Hunter is
the sweetest little idiot

14:17.089 --> 14:18.656
- there ever was.
- (sobbing)

14:18.690 --> 14:20.892
He's so sweet!

14:20.926 --> 14:22.727
He's so sweet!

14:22.761 --> 14:25.063
(loud crying):
Ahh...

14:25.097 --> 14:26.164
(sniffles)

14:26.198 --> 14:27.732
(slurring):
Screw this!

14:27.766 --> 14:30.668
Because... you told me...

14:30.702 --> 14:34.238
to go after what I wanted,
and this is not what I wanted.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.607
Let's go! We're gonna
get you to that game!

14:36.642 --> 14:37.875
It's okay.
They're playing Pasadena.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.278
They don't stand a chance.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.712
Pasadena has a bunch
of bitch-ass tricks.

14:41.747 --> 14:43.081
Weren't raised right.

14:43.115 --> 14:46.250
<i>Hey, what do you want?</i>

14:46.285 --> 14:48.553
I don't know.
I want to be there.

14:48.587 --> 14:52.090
So, spike that ball!

14:52.124 --> 14:55.693
That was not a ball.
That was beer.

14:55.727 --> 14:57.495
I know. I feel really bad about it.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.297
- You know what? Don't feel bad!
- Let's go!

14:59.331 --> 15:01.365
- Let's go!
- You got me all fired up!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.000
I think you're gonna have to drive.

15:06.401 --> 15:07.967
Mr. Miller:
"Were you or were you not  

15:08.002 --> 15:09.369
wearing oversized shoes in the store?"

15:09.403 --> 15:12.272
Mr. Baker:
"I was not. I told you that."

15:12.306 --> 15:14.908
Mr Miller: "But are you sure?"
Mr. Schmidt: "Shut up, Nick."

15:14.942 --> 15:16.910
Mr. Miller:
"Let me do this. Ow. Stop it."

15:16.944 --> 15:19.245
Mr. Schmidt:
"Stop what? You're hitting yourself."

15:19.280 --> 15:21.447
Mr. Miller: "You're a child."

15:21.482 --> 15:23.950
Mr. Schmidt: "A child
would be a better lawyer."

15:23.984 --> 15:26.419
Mr. Furguson:
"Children are our future."

15:26.453 --> 15:28.254
Mr. Berklan: "So true."

15:28.289 --> 15:29.856
Mr. Miller:
"I need to regroup.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.357
I'm gonna stall a
little bit. Watch this.

15:31.392 --> 15:33.760
Could the lady typer read that back?"

15:33.794 --> 15:35.161
All right, all right,
we've had enough.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.030
My client is graciously willing

15:37.064 --> 15:39.132
to settle for $20,000.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.534
As an actual real attorney,

15:41.568 --> 15:42.969
I highly suggest you take the deal.

15:43.003 --> 15:45.705
- Great. We'll do...
- Not a chance.

15:45.739 --> 15:46.706
There's not a chance.

15:46.740 --> 15:47.807
Sidebar. Come on, Schmidt.

15:47.841 --> 15:49.042
- Hurry up.
- Just...

15:50.244 --> 15:52.412
You are not taking that settlement.

15:52.446 --> 15:53.947
Well, Nick, at least if it's $20,000,

15:53.981 --> 15:55.848
I can get out of that hole some day.

15:55.883 --> 15:58.318
I've got a plan. You just have
to give me a chance.

15:59.887 --> 16:01.321
Can you believe in me?

16:01.355 --> 16:03.556
(sighs) All right,
I believe in you. Deal.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.625
- Deal.
- What's the plan?

16:05.659 --> 16:07.560
Oh, I'm not telling you. You're
gonna get too mad. Let's go.

16:07.594 --> 16:09.862
Nick, I take it back! I don't...
I don't believe in you!

16:11.732 --> 16:13.232
Here.

16:16.036 --> 16:17.503
How long is this game?

16:17.538 --> 16:19.772
Go get 'em, Coach.

16:19.807 --> 16:22.909
All right, listen up,
you no-talent,

16:22.943 --> 16:24.711
idiot babies!

16:24.745 --> 16:27.313
Give me that. Give me that.
Give me that. Give me that.

16:27.348 --> 16:28.648
Oh, thank God.

16:28.682 --> 16:30.216
Bring it in.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.551
Come on.

16:31.585 --> 16:33.820
All right, now,

16:33.854 --> 16:35.922
who is gonna win this match?!

16:35.956 --> 16:37.256
All: Coolidge!

16:37.291 --> 16:38.324
Who's number one?

16:38.359 --> 16:39.926
All: Coolidge!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.060
Let me hear it! Who are we?

16:41.095 --> 16:42.662
- Coolidge!
- Rakim!

16:42.696 --> 16:44.530
Really, Rakim?
Like I just walked you

16:44.565 --> 16:46.899
right up to it, and you're
gonna... We're gonna talk.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.168
- Coolidge!
- Too late, man. It's too late.

16:49.203 --> 16:51.337
All right, guys,
get out there and make me proud!

16:51.372 --> 16:53.373
(whistle blows)

16:53.407 --> 16:55.041
- Ms. Day?
- What?

16:55.075 --> 16:57.844
What is going on?
I thought you fired Coach.

16:57.878 --> 17:00.413
Look, Coach loves the kids,
and the kids love him.

17:00.447 --> 17:02.749
I want this job, but I'm
not going to do it your way.

17:02.783 --> 17:05.117
I'm not going to let
our best people go.

17:05.152 --> 17:08.721
You were the one who told me,
we have no money.

17:08.756 --> 17:11.089
Yeah, but we can make it up in
other ways, we can be creative.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.026
We can rent out the multipurpose room

17:13.060 --> 17:14.961
after school to local clubs.

17:14.994 --> 17:16.762
And where will the orchestra practice?

17:16.797 --> 17:18.964
Did you ever consider that, Ms. Day?

17:18.999 --> 17:21.782
Or were you too busy
buying a ladies bike?

17:22.337 --> 17:23.903
- What?
- They can use the library.

17:23.936 --> 17:25.637
No one goes in there anyway.

17:25.672 --> 17:27.073
Yeah, let's burn the books!

17:27.107 --> 17:29.909
Except for <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

17:29.943 --> 17:32.812
Well, that took a weird turn, but...

17:32.846 --> 17:35.048
Thank you, Susan.
That-that's so nice.

17:35.082 --> 17:37.083
What a great solution.

17:37.117 --> 17:39.052
Come on!
Let's do it! (exhales)

17:39.086 --> 17:41.988
Oh! Hunter, you animal!

17:42.022 --> 17:44.257
(excited chattering)

17:44.291 --> 17:46.959
(laughs)
Yeah! Hit the robot.

17:46.994 --> 17:48.594
Uh, uh, yeah, hit it.

17:48.629 --> 17:53.099
I guess we can figure out
some way to keep him here.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.435
God, you frost my cookies.

17:55.469 --> 17:57.103
Thank you.

17:57.137 --> 17:58.538
Way! Uh!

17:58.572 --> 17:59.972
Wait, what am I...
Get... get back out there.

18:00.007 --> 18:01.941
We got...
We still have a game to play.

18:01.975 --> 18:02.775
Hey, Coach, guess what?

18:02.810 --> 18:04.343
- Ball! Oh.
- Oh.

18:04.378 --> 18:05.745
It's okay.

18:05.779 --> 18:07.947
Don't laugh, guys. (laughs)

18:07.981 --> 18:11.250
- Did you see that hit her face?
- I'm okay. I'm gonna sit down.

18:11.285 --> 18:13.152
(sighs)

18:13.187 --> 18:14.987
(sighs)
So, are you gonna sit, or...?

18:15.022 --> 18:16.589
No, I'm gonna stand.

18:16.623 --> 18:18.024
'Cause isn't that what we are doing?

18:18.058 --> 18:19.659
Standing... for the little guy?

18:19.693 --> 18:20.660
(quietly):
What is the plan?

18:20.694 --> 18:22.662
Injustice!

18:22.696 --> 18:24.030
I will not stand for it.

18:24.064 --> 18:25.698
That is why I will sit right now.

18:25.732 --> 18:27.700
I will sit down

18:27.734 --> 18:29.869
in this chair... (groans)

18:29.903 --> 18:31.304
(clattering)

18:31.338 --> 18:34.674
You're negligent! Aah!

18:34.708 --> 18:39.212
Get off me! My neck! My neck!

18:39.246 --> 18:41.781
Seriously? The fall-down
on the chair bit?

18:41.815 --> 18:43.449
- Is this your first case?
- Yes, it is.

18:43.484 --> 18:46.552
And that is why I'll file
petition on petition.

18:46.587 --> 18:48.187
You're gonna wake up in
the morning to paperwork.

18:48.222 --> 18:51.357
You're gonna go to bed at night
to paperwork.

18:52.292 --> 18:53.860
So how about this, gentlemen?

18:53.894 --> 18:57.864
You pay the $20,000 settlement
to your client yourself,

18:57.898 --> 19:00.566
and you'll never
see our faces again.

19:00.601 --> 19:02.034
What do you call a lunatic

19:02.069 --> 19:05.538
who's only got one case
and no hobbies?

19:05.572 --> 19:07.573
Your worst nightmare.

19:07.608 --> 19:10.243
Let's go, guys.

19:11.512 --> 19:14.147
Listen, Bill,

19:14.181 --> 19:15.915
if you ever want
to play with the big boys,

19:15.949 --> 19:19.218
you'll give me a ring, won't you?

19:19.253 --> 19:21.654
(sighs)

19:21.688 --> 19:24.023
This is a baseball card.

19:24.057 --> 19:26.526
Yeah.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.560
Nick: <i>All right!</i>

19:27.594 --> 19:29.428
- All right. You did it.
- I did it.

19:29.463 --> 19:30.530
- Salud.
- Cheers!

19:32.243 --> 19:33.327
- Oh!
- Oh!

19:33.367 --> 19:34.112
Schmidt: Another round of shots.

19:34.294 --> 19:36.102
- On the house!
- You don't get to say that, Winnie.

19:36.136 --> 19:37.336
You know that, right? Okay.

19:37.371 --> 19:39.338
Oh, I knew you'd come back for me.

19:39.373 --> 19:42.408
So what do you want to do
now? You want to just drive?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.110
Oh, no. Mike!

19:44.144 --> 19:45.611
- What?
- Ple... I got it.

19:45.646 --> 19:46.946
Thank you.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.915
Hey, what you doing here?

19:48.949 --> 19:50.449
- I just wanted to come and say...
- Mm-hmm.

19:50.484 --> 19:51.784
First things first.

19:51.818 --> 19:53.619
The legal drinking age
in Australia is 18.

19:53.654 --> 19:55.755
Second, you're really beautiful.

19:55.789 --> 19:57.256
Like, you're really beautiful.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.358
Like, I want
to take you out some time.

19:59.393 --> 20:02.094
But because I'm 20 and already
at a bit of a disadvantage,

20:02.129 --> 20:04.130
I thought I'd come
and do some uncharacteristic

20:04.164 --> 20:05.932
self-promotion to help the cause?

20:05.966 --> 20:07.400
- Okay.
- And let you know that

20:07.434 --> 20:09.135
well, I just opened my own business.

20:09.169 --> 20:11.270
I build boats.

20:11.305 --> 20:13.306
Uh, wooden boats with my hands.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, old ladies love me.

20:16.109 --> 20:17.577
They call me sensitive.

20:17.611 --> 20:18.911
And I'm a really good cook.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.980
But I know three dishes,

20:21.014 --> 20:22.676
and two of those dishes
are the same thing.

20:22.848 --> 20:24.364
(laughs)

20:24.484 --> 20:26.586
Yeah, that's about it,
so, what do you think?

20:26.620 --> 20:28.054
Do you want to get a drink?

20:28.088 --> 20:29.789
Like a soft drink with you?

20:29.823 --> 20:31.624
- Soft drink, a walk.
- Can you have a coffee?

20:31.658 --> 20:33.259
- Yeah, I love coffee.
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.293 --> 20:36.896
It's one of the three meals
that I know how I make.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.498
All right.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.267
- Oh, do it!
- Well, done, sir!

20:41.301 --> 20:42.802
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

20:42.836 --> 20:44.003
Or you know what? We could

20:44.037 --> 20:45.972
actually... we could
probably just go now.

20:46.006 --> 20:48.107
I'd like to comb your hair, you hunk.

20:48.141 --> 20:49.442
I don't know who they are.
They just come in here,

20:49.476 --> 20:51.143
and they drink,
and make a lot of noise

20:51.178 --> 20:52.445
and talk about things
they don't know about!

20:52.479 --> 20:53.846
Hey, Mike,
I'm gonna take a break. Um...

20:53.880 --> 20:55.615
I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll just meet you out front.

20:57.017 --> 20:58.150
Stop what you're doing.

20:58.185 --> 21:00.686
There's a lawyer here to make...

21:00.721 --> 21:02.088
(whispers): Jessica?

21:02.122 --> 21:04.123
Jessica, I won the case.

21:05.659 --> 21:10.029
If you woke up right now,
we could be making love.

21:10.063 --> 21:11.831
Jessica?

21:11.865 --> 21:14.467
Power couple.
