00:37.708 --> 00:39.250
Some people are lovers.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.833
Others, fighters.

00:41.916 --> 00:45.375
And sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.416
I was born a fighter,
but a girl's got bills to pay,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.208
and I didn't have a safety net.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.000
When I wasn't at school, I got a job

00:54.083 --> 00:56.208
training clients for Julian James,

00:56.291 --> 00:58.416
the best fighter on this side
of the Mississippi

00:58.500 --> 01:00.166
and the only father figure I'd ever had.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.125
Looks like she's doing all the work.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.083
-Keep it up, Sienna.
-Nice. One more. Nice.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.000
Now, my sister Beth,

01:13.083 --> 01:16.000
she's a lover, and my other half.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.500
I mean, don't get me wrong.
She drives me nuts,

01:18.583 --> 01:20.500
but our friend Brent balances us out.

01:21.416 --> 01:23.416
That was the extent of my social circle,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.875
and to be honest, I liked it that way.

01:25.958 --> 01:28.958
-You need to focus.
-I tried. That's all you.

01:29.041 --> 01:32.083
I mean, I have more interests.
I don't have to go to college.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.458
Oh, yeah. You know, why?
Why would you get a big girl job

01:34.541 --> 01:36.916
when you could just be
mooching off me forever?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.416
-Great idea. I like where your head's at.
-Ha ha.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.750
-So…
-I'm gonna be right back.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.000
-Just give me one sec.
-I don't think it's gonna work.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.875
-Hey. I'm Jax.
-Hi.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.916
Oh, I knew exactly who he was.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.083
Sienna, right?
I heard you're a great trainer.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.083
Maybe we can get in the ring sometime.

01:59.166 --> 02:03.375
Yeah, he was cute,
but he had a reputation,

02:03.458 --> 02:05.375
and I wasn't just gonna let my guard down.

02:10.125 --> 02:13.041
He was a fighter…

02:15.625 --> 02:17.833
…and a lover,

02:17.916 --> 02:19.666
an intoxicating combination.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.416
One. One, two.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.416
Two. One, two. Two.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.916
Jax was the best I'd ever trained

02:29.000 --> 02:30.916
and the best fighter UFG had ever had.

02:34.083 --> 02:37.416
Nice. It's not just about power, okay?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.208
-It's about precision.
-Is that right?

02:39.291 --> 02:41.833
Making her MXM debut,

02:41.916 --> 02:43.416
we have standing in the center ring

02:43.500 --> 02:46.166
a mixed martial artist from Springfield.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.666
-12 wins by knock-out.
-Whoo!

02:48.750 --> 02:54.625
Sienna "The Princess of Rage" Lane!

02:54.708 --> 02:58.208
-Whoo!
-And the crowd goes wild!

02:58.291 --> 02:59.916
Whoo!

03:02.625 --> 03:05.500
-But…
-Ugh, "but…"

03:06.916 --> 03:08.541
I'm not a princess.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.208
No? You're my princess.

03:11.291 --> 03:15.333
I tried to keep things professional, but…

03:22.500 --> 03:24.708
Whoo!

03:24.791 --> 03:26.208
…I was hooked.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.041
One hit was never enough.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.250
Psst. Sienna.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.416
Sienna.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.416
You're zoning out.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.541
I love you.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.000
Normally, I'd have been more outspoken

03:46.083 --> 03:48.625
about his habit of tempting fate,

03:48.708 --> 03:50.625
but he thought he was invincible,

03:50.708 --> 03:52.708
and I bought in to the myth.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.833
-Until he had an accident…
-Are you doing okay?

03:58.916 --> 04:01.166
…that brought us both back to reality.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.500
-Si, what if I never--
-Hey.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.458
What if I can't fight anymore?

04:11.541 --> 04:13.291
We're gonna get through this.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.541
You don't have to be here.

04:17.750 --> 04:22.000
-Are you crazy?
-Maybe.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.000
-We're a team.
-Yeah.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.916
Rebel champions.

04:30.083 --> 04:33.000
Seeing him like that, so human,

04:33.083 --> 04:35.375
hurting, made it all feel real.

04:38.791 --> 04:41.083
Try to get it parallel to your hip, okay?

04:42.916 --> 04:45.166
Yep.

04:46.625 --> 04:47.833
I'm done.

04:47.916 --> 04:50.208
-Where are you going?
-What's the point?

04:50.291 --> 04:52.833
If I can't kick, I can't fight.

04:52.916 --> 04:56.208
Yes, you can, Jax,
if we strengthen your other skills.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.291
What other skills?

05:06.166 --> 05:07.500
Come here.

05:08.916 --> 05:14.083
We're gonna find you a new edge. Okay?

05:15.666 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.708
He needed me…

05:20.416 --> 05:22.500
…and that's when I really fell.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.416
We were so much more connected,

05:42.500 --> 05:46.666
and eventually he came back

05:46.750 --> 05:47.833
better than before

05:48.875 --> 05:52.250
in every way.

05:53.916 --> 05:55.916
Hey, looking good.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.833
This is Jax. Leave a message.

06:01.916 --> 06:04.625
Hey, uh, so my last client canceled.

06:04.708 --> 06:07.833
Um, I'm just going to run
to the nutrition shop for you

06:07.916 --> 06:09.708
and I will be right home.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.166
-Thank you.
-Okay.

06:17.916 --> 06:19.125
-Thanks.
-Okay.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.541
Things were really good.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.625
And that feeling?

06:25.708 --> 06:29.291
Man, I was riding the high…

06:33.458 --> 06:35.875
…but I should've known
there would be a comedown.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.833
Jax, Beth…

06:44.916 --> 06:46.916
-Sienna.
-I'm so sorry.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.708
Oh, shit.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.833
No matter how far I'd fallen,

07:46.916 --> 07:50.208
I couldn't get him off my mind.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.375
And the worst part?

07:52.250 --> 07:55.083
He probably wasn't even
giving me a second thought.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.166
-Hey, champ. You okay?
-I'm good.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.708
-Great job this week.
-Thank you.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.875
See you tomorrow, boss.

08:13.416 --> 08:17.083
Next stop,
Springfield Community College.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.833
Welcome to rock bottom.

08:25.916 --> 08:30.208
I needed a new project,
somewhere to focus my energy.

08:30.291 --> 08:33.000
But I'd settle for a distraction,

08:33.083 --> 08:35.083
so school would have to do.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.708
Econ 101 was not my fave,

08:40.791 --> 08:43.583
but at least I had Brent.

08:43.666 --> 08:45.000
Brent's a good guy.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.833
He's smart, levelheaded,

08:46.916 --> 08:48.541
and not fucking my sister.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.625
In fact, he's all loved up

08:50.708 --> 08:52.541
and getting married in eight weeks.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.833
Wow, that's what I get
for saving you the best seat in the house?

08:58.916 --> 09:00.083
I see how it is.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.833
You okay?

09:05.916 --> 09:07.833
I caught my sister
and my boyfriend of a year

09:07.916 --> 09:09.875
having sex in our apartment,

09:09.958 --> 09:11.583
and I spent the night in the gym.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.666
Beth and Jax? Shit.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.708
Do you have a place to stay?

09:20.791 --> 09:25.083
I can't afford much.
There's a wait list for campus housing.

09:29.666 --> 09:33.083
I may know a guy renting a room for,
like, 250 a month.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.916
-Yeah?
-Just, um, be careful.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.416
-He's--
-What? An ax murderer?

09:40.333 --> 09:41.791
Complicated.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.500
You spent the night with Daniel?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.541
Jesus, Alex, I was worried sick.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.250
He lives in a basement?

10:09.083 --> 10:11.916
Now I'm really getting murder-y vibes.

10:28.458 --> 10:31.208
-Fuck me.
-Excuse me?

10:31.291 --> 10:35.208
Oh, shit.
That was supposed to be my inside voice.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.458
Um, hi.

10:38.541 --> 10:40.208
Kayden, right?

10:40.291 --> 10:42.625
Brent told me that you might be
looking for a roommate.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.083
-No.
-What? No?

10:48.541 --> 10:52.541
Look, I'm in a really tight spot.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.791
-No offense--
-Oh, wow.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.625
-What?
-No, it's just people say that,

10:57.708 --> 11:00.208
"No offense," like it'll
absolve them of the guilt

11:00.291 --> 11:03.041
of whatever asshole thing
they were about to say.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.708
So what was it you were gonna say?

11:04.791 --> 11:06.625
I don't think it's gonna be a good fit.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.333
Look, I've been through a lot.
I have nowhere else to stay.

11:10.416 --> 11:11.708
Not my problem.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.166
Okay. Fair point.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.666
It wasn't his problem.

11:18.083 --> 11:21.000
But did he have to be such a jerk?

11:21.083 --> 11:23.416
Well, at least he's up-front about it.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.291
Jax kept that shit under wraps
till I was far too gone.

11:27.541 --> 11:30.000
Back to the drawing board.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.500
As much as I hated asking for help,

11:32.583 --> 11:35.291
maybe Julian could give me
a little direction.

11:35.375 --> 11:39.958
Julian, got anyone
on the books for me today?

11:40.041 --> 11:41.625
'Fraid not.

11:41.708 --> 11:43.625
Everybody's jumping ship.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.000
Basement brawls
are starting back up at Powder Keg.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.958
More money, less rules,

11:51.625 --> 11:56.166
and Jax is the poster boy.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.500
You didn't know?

12:00.916 --> 12:02.791
Loyalty isn't really his thing.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.208
Yeah, well, ever since he stormed out,

12:04.291 --> 12:06.166
we've been dying a slow death,

12:06.250 --> 12:08.083
and now we've lost our best fighter.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.416
-How are we supposed to compete with that?
-Well, we don't.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.000
I would rather lose this gym honestly
than stoop to the underground.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.958
I mean, it's a sport. It's not worth
getting somebody killed for.

12:19.875 --> 12:23.000
Kayden "The Killer" Williams, huh?

12:23.083 --> 12:25.083
Small world.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.416
Powder Keg was UFG's biggest rival,

12:28.500 --> 12:31.291
and the underground operated
out of their basement.

12:33.083 --> 12:36.208
Nothing feels legal here--
because it isn't.

12:42.958 --> 12:45.916
You're a trainer? UFG, huh?

12:54.083 --> 12:56.416
There is only one rule!

12:56.500 --> 12:58.625
There are no rules!

12:59.916 --> 13:02.000
Oh, man, he's out!

13:05.083 --> 13:07.541
Hey there, princess.
Come to watch me fight?

13:07.625 --> 13:09.625
-No, I've seen enough.
-Hey, hey.

13:09.708 --> 13:12.083
-All right, stop.
-It just--

13:12.166 --> 13:15.125
It just happened, okay?
You're the only one who understands me.

13:15.208 --> 13:18.208
I don't understand you at all.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.750
Please, can you help me do that?

13:20.833 --> 13:22.875
I don't know, you just-- you got so busy.

13:22.958 --> 13:26.625
-Busy? Taking care of you!
-No, I didn't mean it like that, okay?

13:26.708 --> 13:28.458
-You know I'm not good at this stuff.
-For the last year,

13:28.541 --> 13:29.958
it's been all about you.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.583
Figuring out how to rehab your stupid leg,

13:32.666 --> 13:35.416
meal prepping for you, loving you,

13:35.500 --> 13:37.666
making sure that you're good
to fight again.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.333
I made a mistake. Babe--

13:40.416 --> 13:43.041
A mistake is forgetting to pick up dinner.

13:44.041 --> 13:47.916
Fucking my little sister is an act of war.

13:49.666 --> 13:50.666
Si--

13:52.375 --> 13:54.000
5 to 1 odds.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.000
Deadbeat's favored. You want in?

14:00.291 --> 14:01.916
100 on Kayden Williams.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.250
Right.

14:27.708 --> 14:31.125
Yeah! Let's go!

14:31.208 --> 14:32.333
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

14:34.083 --> 14:37.500
Brent? What are you doing here?

14:37.583 --> 14:39.500
I could ask you the same thing.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.625
I, uh-- I'm here with my fiancé.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.500
Evans. You must be Sienna.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.833
-Heard you had a rough week, huh?
-Yeah.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.791
But it's good to finally meet you.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.625
Unlike my love life,

14:50.708 --> 14:53.208
which had been very much on display,

14:53.291 --> 14:55.000
Brent kept things low-key.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.166
Like, he'd never introduced me
to his fiancé low-key.

15:03.666 --> 15:07.416
Kayden "The Killer" Williams!

15:30.625 --> 15:32.416
Ready? Ready?

15:32.500 --> 15:33.916
Go. Fight.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.125
How do you know each other again?

15:45.208 --> 15:46.875
He's my brother.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.791
I didn't know you had a brother.

15:48.875 --> 15:49.875
Adopted.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.291
Come here.

16:12.125 --> 16:15.166
He's good, but he's not unbeatable.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.291
He was till tonight.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.708
Fuck.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.541
How do you know him?

16:53.625 --> 16:56.291
That's my ex.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.666
I'd give anything for Jax

16:57.750 --> 17:00.000
to get a taste of his own medicine.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.375
It didn't look like
that was gonna happen tonight,

17:02.458 --> 17:06.166
but Kayden had promise.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.916
Police, police, police!

17:24.708 --> 17:27.750
-Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
-Hey, it's a raid.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.791
Deadbeat, break it up! We need to get out!

17:31.583 --> 17:34.208
-Everybody's going!
-See you later, Sienna.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.666
-We're not done yet.
-Let's go, let's go.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.916
-Everybody out of here.
-I want my rematch, Killer!

17:48.500 --> 17:50.208
Keep walking.

17:50.291 --> 17:53.333
-Come on, everybody out.
-All right, let's go.

18:07.291 --> 18:10.083
Okay, I guess this is rock bottom.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.000
Hopefully.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.541
I was out my last hundred bucks,

18:14.625 --> 18:16.791
and I couldn't keep sneaking into the gym.

18:24.541 --> 18:26.458
I haven't tied one on
like that in so long.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.708
Hey, good for you. Good for you.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.625
I had to stop feeling sorry for myself.

18:35.708 --> 18:38.083
No more sad girl shit,

18:38.166 --> 18:40.666
I was on to that mad girl shit.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.875
And I was not about to let
Jax get away with this.

18:43.625 --> 18:46.000
Powder Keg was the seventh circle of hell,

18:46.083 --> 18:48.208
right after CrossFit,

18:48.291 --> 18:50.916
but you can't slay a demon
if you're afraid of fire.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.375
I thought I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.041
Technically, you told me
I wasn't your problem.

19:01.125 --> 19:04.708
And you were right. I am your solution.

19:04.791 --> 19:08.250
-I'm good.
-You're good, but you're not great.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.916
Your reflexes are quick,
but you've got poor intention.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.583
Your defense is spotty,
you telegraph your punches,

19:13.666 --> 19:15.416
and you're not using
the right hip movement on the mat

19:15.500 --> 19:18.791
to offset someone stronger, which he is.

19:18.875 --> 19:23.208
-And that's why you need me.
-Oh, I need you?

19:23.291 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, I am the only person
who can help you beat Jax Deneris.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.791
Who said I'm taking a rematch?

19:30.958 --> 19:32.500
I mean…

19:34.500 --> 19:38.041
Look, I've been in the ring
with Jax for three years.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.208
I stand before you a copy of your enemy.

19:41.291 --> 19:45.708
I know how he thinks,
how he trains, how he kills.

19:45.791 --> 19:49.416
I saw you lose, and I am the only one

19:49.500 --> 19:51.583
who can make sure
that doesn't happen again.

19:56.500 --> 20:00.166
Okay, what are you offering specifically?

20:00.250 --> 20:03.416
I train you six days a week
from now through the rematch.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.666
I train every day, 3-6-5.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.541
Yeah, that's the first thing
I'll be changing.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.875
You want me to train less?

20:07.958 --> 20:09.916
No, I want you to train smarter,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.958
and rest days are a part of that.

20:14.708 --> 20:19.833
And in turn, you…

20:19.916 --> 20:21.250
let me stay in your apartment.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.833
I mean, come on.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.416
I bet all my money on you last night,

20:24.500 --> 20:27.708
so, I mean, you kind of owe me.

20:34.708 --> 20:38.250
All right, lucky, let's see what you got.

20:40.916 --> 20:42.958
Well, I mean, for starters,

20:43.041 --> 20:44.333
just keep your eyes a little bit forward

20:44.416 --> 20:46.791
and take that curve out of your neck.

20:46.875 --> 20:50.291
Just kind of tuck in your lumbar sacrum.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.958
Your room's over there.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.500
Yikes.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.875
Hey, you go to SCC too.

21:18.916 --> 21:22.333
I didn't get to introduce
myself the other day. Cara.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.208
Sienna.

21:25.291 --> 21:27.958
-Want a ride?
-Uh, no, I'm good.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.416
Are you sure? 'Cause the bus sucks,

21:30.500 --> 21:33.250
and we're going to the same place.
Let's go.

21:39.791 --> 21:42.000
-She's temperamental.
-Mm.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.708
I'm guessing
I can't link my Spotify in this?

21:45.791 --> 21:47.875
No.

21:55.041 --> 21:58.000
So, you lived in Springfield
your whole life

21:58.083 --> 22:00.208
and you don't have
any family here or friends?

22:00.291 --> 22:02.083
-Not anymore.
-Why's that?

22:05.500 --> 22:08.833
Because that's my sister

22:08.916 --> 22:11.041
and that's my ex-boyfriend.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.708
Oh.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.416
Si, look, I tried to tell you,

22:17.500 --> 22:19.625
but you're not the easiest
person to talk to.

22:19.708 --> 22:22.416
I've been working my ass off
trying to take care of you.

22:23.666 --> 22:26.166
Beth, I haven't been able
to get you to come to school for months,

22:26.250 --> 22:28.041
and then you're gonna come together?

22:31.541 --> 22:32.541
Si, I'm sorry--

22:32.625 --> 22:34.875
You don't know what
you're dealing with, okay?

22:34.958 --> 22:37.291
He is toxic and manipulative.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.958
You can't fix him.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.916
I already tried.

22:54.875 --> 22:58.208
Kayden. Come on, cupcake. Rise and shine.

23:14.625 --> 23:15.625
Motherfucker.

23:15.708 --> 23:18.458
Hey, asshole, we had a deal.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.291
Hey, you're done.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.416
Listen, I gave you
your money back. We're even.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.000
I don't want your handouts, okay?
I want to win.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.916
We had a deal. Hit me.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.666
-No.
-Come on.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.333
Hit me. Let's go!

23:37.416 --> 23:40.000
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.541
Find another project.
This is not personal.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.166
Come on.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.708
Hit me. Let's go.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.708
All right. Let's go.

24:05.625 --> 24:06.875
Come on.

24:15.833 --> 24:19.625
It is personal to me.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.625
You wanna beat him? You just lost.

24:24.708 --> 24:27.208
You're mine, Sienna.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.500
I want you. All of you.

24:37.375 --> 24:38.708
Sienna, I'm tapping.

24:38.791 --> 24:39.791
Sienna.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.166
Seriously?

24:45.250 --> 24:47.916
Why does my mind keep going back to Jax?

24:49.500 --> 24:50.750
You hungry?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.083
Yeah.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.958
Hi, neighbors. The usual?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.833
-Mm-hmm.
-You got it.

25:03.916 --> 25:05.625
Can I get you anything?

25:06.666 --> 25:08.833
Five egg whites, scrambled,
with a side of salsa,

25:08.916 --> 25:11.750
half an avocado,
and a chicken breast, no oil.

25:11.833 --> 25:14.125
Coming right up.

25:19.041 --> 25:21.416
So, uh, what are you studying?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.708
Social economics in business.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.791
Impressive.

25:28.916 --> 25:31.875
Look, this is gonna be really hard.

25:31.958 --> 25:34.583
Hard?

25:34.666 --> 25:37.000
The hardest you'll train in your life.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.125
Don't flatter yourself.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.125
I am never dating another fighter.

25:40.208 --> 25:43.708
You shouldn't. Especially me.

25:50.208 --> 25:53.625
-Excuse me.
-That's what you're eating?

25:53.708 --> 25:56.500
Nope, that's what you're eating.

26:01.833 --> 26:03.333
Mmm.

26:03.416 --> 26:06.416
You know there's no weight class
in the underground, right?

26:06.500 --> 26:08.625
Jax is bigger than me.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.916
You don't need to cut,
but you should be tracking your macros.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.750
Pack proteins with isolates,
and you'd better not be juicing.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.708
What else?

26:16.791 --> 26:18.791
Julian doesn't want
any of his team in the underground,

26:18.875 --> 26:21.666
so I come to you at Powder Keg.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.833
You do exactly what I say.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.750
No drinking, no smoking, no partying.

26:26.833 --> 26:27.875
No problem.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.916
That's a really good burger.

26:42.708 --> 26:44.500
I know. It's my usual.

26:45.916 --> 26:47.375
Good choice.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.291
Come on. Quick feet!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.291
Keep your abs tight.

28:20.750 --> 28:23.125
Good to see you, stranger.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.708
Nice to see you too, boss.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.000
I got a few interesting calls this week.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.000
One from a promoter

28:32.083 --> 28:34.416
seeing if you wanted
to fight at the nationals.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.208
-Me?
-Yeah.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.500
-Fight?
-Yeah.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.000
I'm just really busy. Um…

28:41.083 --> 28:43.833
Yeah, right, with all your clients.

28:43.916 --> 28:47.416
No, I just am taking
20 credits this semester.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.208
-Your sister called.
-Here?

28:50.291 --> 28:52.625
Yeah, she says you're not
answering your phone.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.666
Yeah, my bad?

28:54.750 --> 28:56.625
She sounded like
she was seriously concerned.

28:56.708 --> 28:59.125
Wow. That's ironic.

29:00.291 --> 29:03.833
You know what?
Holding onto anger is like drinking poison

29:03.916 --> 29:05.958
and expecting the other person to die.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.041
It's keeping you from being your best.

29:11.958 --> 29:16.291
Or maybe it's just giving me my edge.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.125
Get real with yourself, Sienna.

29:19.708 --> 29:22.833
I just think whatever it is,
this story that you're telling yourself,

29:22.916 --> 29:24.458
it's not necessarily reality.

29:34.833 --> 29:36.750
Okay, what are you looking at?

29:43.625 --> 29:45.666
Don't just defend. Be first.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.833
For every one, you give three.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.250
No.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.125
You're letting your guard down.

29:57.083 --> 29:59.041
-That's it.
-No, that's not it.

29:59.125 --> 30:02.500
Defense is not an action.
It's a given, okay?

30:02.583 --> 30:04.500
Your resting state should be impenetrable.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.083
No one gets in, no one can hurt you.

30:07.166 --> 30:08.791
Come on, one, two.

30:12.916 --> 30:15.125
Every time someone attacks,
they leave an opening.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.791
Find the opening, close for the kill.

30:18.791 --> 30:20.166
Right hook.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.375
Find the opening…

30:27.208 --> 30:28.708
…close for the kill.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.083
Okay.

30:41.833 --> 30:45.416
Sienna, can I talk to you, please?

30:45.500 --> 30:46.791
Since when do you even work out?

30:46.875 --> 30:48.750
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.375
Talk to me, please.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.833
-Get out of my way, Beth.
-No!

30:52.916 --> 30:55.666
-Jax told me to stand up for myself.
-Oh, he did?

30:55.750 --> 30:57.750
Did he also tell you
to do your hair like this?

30:57.833 --> 31:00.416
'Cause it looks like
you fucked the Easter Bunny.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.458
Move.

31:10.250 --> 31:13.666
I was trying to move on,
but talk about triggering.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.583
Jax had told me
to stand up for myself, too,

31:17.666 --> 31:20.416
unless it got in the way
of what he wanted.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.625
-That's all you got?
-Come on.

31:21.708 --> 31:23.416
-That's it?
-Hit me back.

31:23.500 --> 31:26.333
I'm not gonna hit you back, okay?
I need you in one piece.

31:26.416 --> 31:29.291
If I'm ever gonna fight,
I need to take a hit.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.333
Who said you're gonna fight?

31:33.291 --> 31:37.041
The things you overlook
when you're under their influence.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.791
Ooh!

31:41.916 --> 31:44.916
Come on, I could be really good.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.666
You are good, but you're a better trainer.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.208
Was that your sister?

32:12.291 --> 32:13.583
How could you tell?

32:15.083 --> 32:16.500
The tension.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.166
Mm.

32:21.916 --> 32:23.625
-What?
-Nothing.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.000
Nothing? Doesn't sound like nothing.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.500
-What does it sound like?
-Judgment.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.416
-I don't know the situation here…
-No, you don't.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.416
-…but family is important.
-Yeah?

32:33.458 --> 32:36.500
Is that why you're holed up
in a basement alone?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.291
Stay in your lane.

32:51.916 --> 32:54.000
Of course I was angry.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.000
It was helping me get over Jax.

32:57.083 --> 32:58.916
And I was getting over him.

33:02.208 --> 33:03.708
Kinda.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.000
Sienna.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.583
Sienna.

33:53.666 --> 33:55.333
Sienna!

33:55.416 --> 33:57.041
Good dream?

33:57.125 --> 33:59.416
Shit.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.625
My alarm didn't go off.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.750
Let's go. It is officially confirmed.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.041
10:00, March 31st.

34:08.416 --> 34:10.291
-The rematch?
-Mm-hmm.

34:11.166 --> 34:14.125
Okay, you're gonna do what I say, right?

34:14.208 --> 34:17.291
No moody disappearing act or quid pro quo?

34:18.416 --> 34:20.375
"If you do this, I'll do that."

34:20.458 --> 34:22.000
I know what quid pro quo means.

34:22.083 --> 34:25.541
-So?
-Yes, sensei.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.958
Good.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.416
By the way, you talk in your sleep.

34:35.666 --> 34:37.916
We'd made progress,
but if he was gonna have

34:38.000 --> 34:39.916
any chance of beating Jax

34:40.000 --> 34:41.958
I'd need to pull out all the stops.

34:43.458 --> 34:46.541
-Come on.
-What is this?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.916
Mixing your MA. Do you trust me?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.208
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you sure?

34:51.291 --> 34:53.625
Well, when you say it like that…

35:05.291 --> 35:07.416
Okay.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.916
This is sensitivity training.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.208
The basic theory is
if your breath is grounded in your body

35:13.291 --> 35:14.833
and you're in sync with your opponent,

35:14.916 --> 35:17.625
you can overtake them
no matter their size.

35:17.708 --> 35:20.916
Okay? So just feel me.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.291
Uh-huh. Nice and easy.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.416
Breathe.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.083
Feel my next move.

35:31.166 --> 35:34.416
So, stay grounded in your body

35:35.708 --> 35:37.708
so no matter what tries to control you…

35:39.416 --> 35:40.916
-Whoa!
-Oh!

35:43.583 --> 35:46.291
-Don't fall off.
-I'm not gonna let you fall.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.083
You're good.

35:50.583 --> 35:54.208
Feel my next movement. Yep, yep.

35:55.291 --> 35:58.000
That's it. That's it.

35:58.083 --> 36:00.333
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

36:05.916 --> 36:06.916
Nice.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
-Again.
-Again.

36:15.083 --> 36:18.083
You are a unique trainer, Sensei Lane.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.083
I borrowed that exercise from Julian.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.833
-He is a legend.
-Yeah.

36:26.916 --> 36:30.291
It's big shoes to fill.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.833
We talked about me maybe--

36:37.916 --> 36:39.791
maybe running the gym with him someday.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.208
Really?

36:41.291 --> 36:42.833
It's kind of why I'm studying business

36:42.916 --> 36:45.416
so I can help
with the books and everything.

36:46.416 --> 36:48.666
So you really never considered fighting?

36:52.125 --> 36:55.250
Of course I did. I do.

36:56.750 --> 37:01.208
But Jax always said I wasn't tough enough,

37:01.291 --> 37:03.583
-strong enough, good enough.
-Mm.

37:05.083 --> 37:08.125
Looking back, I think he didn't want me
to take what was his.

37:08.916 --> 37:10.916
The irony.

37:12.291 --> 37:14.625
And there's a whole stigma with women

37:14.708 --> 37:18.625
like we shouldn't get punched in the face
because beauty's our only asset,

37:18.708 --> 37:21.416
whereas men can afford to get busted up

37:21.500 --> 37:24.500
because you guys have
other valued qualities.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.833
Well, not that my opinion
matters for shit,

37:31.916 --> 37:36.916
but I support you fighting whatever war
you see as important.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.083
Inside and outside the cage.

37:43.333 --> 37:46.041
I saw Jax and Beth at the gym.

37:46.125 --> 37:51.541
I've done a lot of things
in my life that I regret…

37:53.708 --> 37:55.291
…but he should know better.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.166
He's going to.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.166
Come on, you're letting your guard down.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.000
Come on, Kayden, stay ahead of him.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.000
-Nice, Kayden.
-He's getting better.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.041
Yeah, his timing is improving.

38:19.125 --> 38:20.208
Come on.

38:20.291 --> 38:23.041
That's it. Find the openings!

38:23.125 --> 38:26.458
Hit the holes! Nice.

38:26.541 --> 38:29.625
-Come on.
-Hey, princess.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.958
You see me fight the other night?

38:32.041 --> 38:33.375
KO in 34 seconds.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.291
Jax, stop. I'm working.

38:35.375 --> 38:37.708
-This is your new guy?
-Come on, Kayden.

38:37.791 --> 38:41.000
Yikes. That's a step down.

38:41.083 --> 38:43.208
He's just sparring.

38:43.291 --> 38:45.541
Come on, let me talk to you for a second.

38:45.625 --> 38:46.625
Hey.

38:46.708 --> 38:48.250
You're too good for this
underground bullshit.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.458
You don't belong here.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.375
Since when do you care
about my well-being?

38:51.458 --> 38:53.666
What? You can't say that
I don't care about you.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.000
When I wanted to fight on my own,

38:55.083 --> 38:57.916
you didn't believe in me,
you shut it down.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.416
And then when I tried to
get close to you, you cheated.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.458
I got scared, okay? It's fight or flight.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.875
But I miss you, Si. Remember?

39:05.958 --> 39:08.958
It's you and I against the world.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.750
Come here. Stop.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.458
Kayden, protect yourself!

39:12.541 --> 39:14.666
Keep moving.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.833
-You're still seeing her.
-I can stop.

39:17.916 --> 39:20.458
She's just easier.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.291
-Easier?
-I didn't mean it like that.

39:23.375 --> 39:25.833
Kayden Williams is the next champion,

39:25.916 --> 39:28.125
and I'm training him to break you.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.625
-Here, hold still.
-Mm.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.708
-Is that okay?
-Mm-hmm.

39:37.791 --> 39:40.833
-What'd Jax say?
-It doesn't matter.

39:40.916 --> 39:42.500
All that matters is that we win.

39:42.583 --> 39:46.125
-What if we don't win?
-We will.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.416
He knows you're a threat,

39:47.500 --> 39:49.416
especially now that you have me.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.416
Jax preys on weakness, okay?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.625
So if you any,
we need to know what they are

39:53.708 --> 39:55.625
-and get ahead of them.
-Uh-huh.

39:55.708 --> 39:58.000
-Look what we got.
-Look what we have here.

39:58.708 --> 40:01.416
My girlfriend said you were begging
for sloppy seconds.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.416
-Thought she was joking.
-You know, you have a really interesting

40:04.500 --> 40:07.291
definition of girlfriend,
if it's someone you use,

40:07.375 --> 40:09.458
gaslight, and cheat on
with her own sister.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.208
Honestly,
not that surprising coming from someone

40:12.291 --> 40:14.833
that dropped out of the big leagues
to fight below their weight class.

40:14.916 --> 40:17.291
-You don't know shit about me.
-Yeah?

40:17.375 --> 40:20.000
-Yeah, there you go.
-Oh!

40:20.083 --> 40:22.541
-Back off, deadbeat!
-Oh, princess!

40:24.750 --> 40:28.541
-Don't fucking call me that.
-Oh.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.416
Forgot how sexy you are when you're angry.

40:32.916 --> 40:35.208
Almost as sexy as your sister.

40:35.291 --> 40:37.000
Yikes.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.041
Too much?

40:41.541 --> 40:43.041
Shit! Sienna!

40:44.166 --> 40:46.875
What the fuck? Hey!

40:46.958 --> 40:50.541
What the fuck? Get over here!

40:52.500 --> 40:54.083
I'll fucking kill you!

40:55.625 --> 40:56.833
Go to hell!

41:04.666 --> 41:06.791
Jax brought out the worst in me,

41:06.875 --> 41:09.291
but it felt good standing up to him.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
Maybe I need to do more for myself.

41:29.083 --> 41:30.458
What are you doing? I told you, I--

41:30.541 --> 41:33.291
You convinced yourself
you don't deserve a home. I know.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.000
So, what do you think?

41:36.083 --> 41:39.375
Belladonna Lily or Labrador Blue?

41:43.916 --> 41:47.291
What? Was Benjamin Moore out of
Doom and Gloom Gray?

41:47.375 --> 41:50.291
Yeah, as well as Brooding Beige.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.958
Hmm. What about Annoying Orange
or Relentless Red?

41:56.041 --> 41:58.250
No, they weren't.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.666
Apparently, they still have those ones.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.583
-Unfortunate.
-Mm-hmm.

42:07.666 --> 42:10.541
Come here!

42:20.750 --> 42:22.791
-Oh, no. You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't?

42:22.875 --> 42:24.208
-No.
-You don't think I will?

42:24.291 --> 42:25.625
-No, I don't.
-I will if you dare me.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.958
-Not even that one. No, no.
-You owe me.

42:34.041 --> 42:36.125
You brought this upon yourself.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.625
Come on. Just a little bit. Just a little.

42:37.708 --> 42:39.625
-Okay. Okay, a little.
-You owe it to me.

42:39.708 --> 42:41.916
-Just a little. Just a little.
-Yeah, okay.

43:03.583 --> 43:04.583
What?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.500
I can't.

43:09.291 --> 43:11.875
I can't have any distractions right now.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.208
I gotta get my head in the game.

43:16.291 --> 43:17.875
I was almost pinned last night.

43:17.958 --> 43:20.625
You're right.

43:20.708 --> 43:22.500
Okay, we just need to focus.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.916
Maybe we should try something different.

43:28.416 --> 43:30.916
No, absolutely not.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.416
You don't understand
how dangerous it is, okay?

43:33.500 --> 43:36.333
It's not a sport, it's senseless violence,

43:36.416 --> 43:38.750
and UFG is above that.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.916
If I get caught, I lose my license.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.250
I lose everything.

43:42.333 --> 43:44.208
You're losing now anyway.

43:44.291 --> 43:45.833
We've been underwater for months.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.916
Kayden is the real deal.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.125
So why does he fight in the underground?

43:50.208 --> 43:52.916
Why don't you ask him?

44:00.541 --> 44:02.750
Julian, this is Kayden.

44:02.833 --> 44:05.500
It's an honor.
I used to watch all your interviews.

44:06.375 --> 44:07.458
Without you, I--

44:07.541 --> 44:09.416
What, you wouldn't be
beating up men in basements?

44:09.500 --> 44:14.166
Yeah, but you-- you opened my eyes.
You opened my mind.

44:14.250 --> 44:15.250
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.041
You taught me that fighting
is about so much more

44:17.125 --> 44:18.750
than just getting the biggest hit in.

44:21.541 --> 44:22.666
Take a seat.

44:27.666 --> 44:31.208
You know, martial arts is about joining
your mind, body, and spirit.

44:31.291 --> 44:33.583
It's an extension of your education.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.125
Well, I always wanted to go to school,

44:36.208 --> 44:39.000
but to be honest,
that just wasn't in the cards for me.

44:39.083 --> 44:41.208
But I'd be hiding in the back of a gym,

44:41.291 --> 44:44.125
I'd be on a bus reading anyone
that you mentioned.

44:44.208 --> 44:45.916
So why stay underground?

44:48.083 --> 44:50.708
-It's all I know.
-Then why do you need me?

44:52.500 --> 44:58.333
Because I need to beat Jax,
and that's where he lives.

44:58.416 --> 44:59.666
That's what this is about.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.833
He betrayed me. And he betrayed you!

45:01.916 --> 45:04.208
-You have every right to want--
-Sienna, I--

45:04.291 --> 45:08.416
Come on. Julian,
this could really put us back on the map.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.500
When Kayden wins,
he's gonna go legit here,

45:11.583 --> 45:13.708
and the fighters
are gonna flock from everywhere

45:13.791 --> 45:15.500
hoping for the same thing.

45:16.166 --> 45:19.000
You're gonna have your champ
and a following.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.708
My champ and a following?
It's not about ego.

45:22.708 --> 45:25.000
Come on.

45:25.083 --> 45:26.083
Please.

45:27.750 --> 45:29.500
We really need your help.

45:29.583 --> 45:33.375
I really need your help.

45:33.458 --> 45:34.916
Let me be clear.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.291
I will never support the underground.

45:41.083 --> 45:42.125
But I support you.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.041
You've gotta choose.

45:46.125 --> 45:49.291
Are you fighters or whatever this is?

45:49.375 --> 45:50.916
Because if you train in this gym,

45:51.000 --> 45:52.500
it has to be as professionals.

45:52.583 --> 45:56.416
Mixing business with pleasure
didn't work out for you last time.

45:56.500 --> 46:00.958
And in the cage,
a fraction of a second of distraction

46:01.833 --> 46:03.083
can get you killed.

46:12.916 --> 46:14.291
Nice!

46:45.500 --> 46:47.250
Yes! Nice.

46:48.458 --> 46:52.291
-You see how he's coming…
-Come on. Breathe.

47:09.875 --> 47:12.000
-Hey.
-Sienna.

47:12.083 --> 47:13.875
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

47:13.958 --> 47:17.000
-I'm just happy you're here.
-Of course.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.708
You actually just missed my mom.
She's been dying to meet you.

47:19.791 --> 47:21.583
-Really?
-Yeah, Kayden may have

47:21.666 --> 47:23.625
mentioned your name once or twice.

47:25.541 --> 47:28.375
-No pressure. No.
-No pressure.

47:30.291 --> 47:32.250
Here's the dress we picked.

47:33.291 --> 47:34.833
-Wow.
-Yeah.

47:34.916 --> 47:38.000
But one of my bridesmaids

47:38.083 --> 47:40.666
asked if she could design the dresses.

47:40.750 --> 47:42.208
-Good one.
-Gotcha.

47:42.291 --> 47:44.208
-Now this is beautiful.
-Way better, right?

47:44.291 --> 47:45.708
Yes.

47:45.791 --> 47:47.958
I thought you'd look great
in this neckline.

47:49.125 --> 47:50.458
You know what? This one's fine.

47:50.541 --> 47:52.291
This one's actually better than fine.

47:52.375 --> 47:53.833
-Mm.
-Yep.

47:53.916 --> 47:55.416
You didn't care to mention this?

47:55.500 --> 47:59.208
I love you both, and it's my big day.

47:59.291 --> 48:02.291
So deal with it, okay? Thank you.

48:09.458 --> 48:11.750
Look, I'm sorry you feel betrayed--

48:11.833 --> 48:13.625
That's not a good way to start an apology,

48:13.708 --> 48:15.750
dodging responsibility.

48:15.833 --> 48:19.458
Okay. I am sorry I betrayed you.

48:19.541 --> 48:23.208
I know how much you sacrificed
to make sure I was okay.

48:23.291 --> 48:26.166
But, Sienna,
it has been so hard living in your shadow,

48:26.250 --> 48:29.416
and Jax was the first person
to pay attention to me.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.958
I'm just trying to figure out who I am.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.500
By what? Being tied up and degraded?

48:35.583 --> 48:36.833
He asks if I want it.

48:36.916 --> 48:38.416
But you don't know what you want, Beth.

48:38.500 --> 48:39.875
-You're 18!
-Oh, and you do?

48:39.958 --> 48:42.416
I don't! Uh, no, I don't!

48:42.500 --> 48:45.416
I know there's a difference
between liking it rough

48:45.500 --> 48:47.416
and manipulating women to serve your ego.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.000
You know, Si, it's not about you.
Just stay out of it.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.583
Beth, it's not about you either.

48:50.666 --> 48:52.416
This is about Jax

48:52.500 --> 48:55.791
and the pleasure he gets
from taking our power.

48:55.875 --> 48:58.375
He loves me.

49:00.541 --> 49:02.625
I knew what she was going through

49:02.708 --> 49:05.250
and that it was gonna get worse.

49:05.333 --> 49:07.583
But when you're that far gone,

49:07.666 --> 49:10.083
only you can decide
when you're ready for help.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.708
You carb-loading there, lucky?

49:24.291 --> 49:27.208
Don't worry about it.
Why aren't you at the gym?

49:27.291 --> 49:30.000
-Miss me?
-I already put in eight hours today.

49:30.083 --> 49:32.291
I'm supposed to take the next 24 off.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.333
Unless, of course, you changed your mind
about having a rest day.

49:34.416 --> 49:36.916
No. Definitely not.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.000
You okay?

49:43.500 --> 49:46.416
-Great.
-Yeah?

49:48.625 --> 49:51.375
Uh, listen,

49:53.083 --> 49:55.208
I'm here if you want
to talk about anything.

50:00.375 --> 50:01.875
It's just Beth.

50:04.083 --> 50:06.208
I swear, it's like she's living
on another fucking planet.

50:06.291 --> 50:09.166
Like, in what world
does she not see what he's doing?

50:09.250 --> 50:11.833
She saw what he did to me,

50:11.916 --> 50:14.708
chipping away at my self-esteem
and gaslighting me.

50:20.708 --> 50:22.291
Uh, I'll get this one.

50:29.083 --> 50:32.000
-Who is that?
-It's no one.

50:32.083 --> 50:33.208
Oh, come on, Kayden.

50:33.291 --> 50:36.000
I open up to you,
and you're still a vault?

50:36.083 --> 50:38.833
Good to see the dynamic duo
back together again.

50:38.916 --> 50:40.333
Can I get you anything?

50:46.416 --> 50:48.500
I know you two are low-key
fight clubbing it,

50:48.583 --> 50:50.875
and it's kind of cool
to know people that are so hard.

50:50.958 --> 50:53.583
But do you have to be so hard
on each other?

51:31.500 --> 51:35.083
Why did it bother me so much
that Kayden wouldn't let me in?

51:35.166 --> 51:39.000
His whole brooding,
mysterious thing was getting to me.

51:39.083 --> 51:42.125
But, no, we were in this to beat Jax.

51:42.208 --> 51:44.833
It was purely a business transaction,

51:44.916 --> 51:46.458
and that's all I wanted.

51:46.541 --> 51:48.000
-Hey.
-Right?

51:48.083 --> 51:49.583
Sienna.

51:49.666 --> 51:52.291
Hey, Sienna.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.916
It's me!

51:57.000 --> 51:58.125
I could have snapped your wrist.

51:58.208 --> 51:59.833
Were you-- have you been following me?

51:59.916 --> 52:03.500
No. Yeah. Uh--

52:08.333 --> 52:10.541
I'm sorry I got mad.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.791
I mean, don't. Don't do that.

52:14.875 --> 52:19.625
-Do what?
-That. That-- that look.

52:19.708 --> 52:21.416
-What? That's my face.
-I…

52:23.500 --> 52:25.708
I know. It's just…

52:39.375 --> 52:41.416
You're the last thing on my mind at night.

52:41.500 --> 52:43.666
The first thing in the morning.

52:43.750 --> 52:47.000
You are the smartest,

52:47.083 --> 52:49.416
strongest, most insanely stubborn,

52:49.500 --> 52:52.166
beautiful force of a woman
I have ever met,

52:53.291 --> 52:55.208
and it kills me knowing
that I can't give you

52:55.291 --> 52:57.583
everything that you deserve.

52:57.666 --> 53:00.750
Kayden, people are allowed to change…

53:02.291 --> 53:06.958
…grow, make mistakes, and then move on.

53:09.250 --> 53:10.625
Whatever it is that you've gone through

53:10.708 --> 53:13.333
that's made the person
standing in front of me,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.708
it's enough.

53:18.416 --> 53:20.083
You're enough.

53:49.708 --> 53:51.500
Tell me to stop and I will.

53:51.583 --> 53:53.041
No way.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.083
Julian's gonna kill us.

55:47.916 --> 55:49.291
Not if he doesn't know.

55:51.500 --> 55:52.916
He'll know.

56:39.916 --> 56:42.958
Um, we can just pretend it never happened

56:43.041 --> 56:46.708
if you have regrets or anything.

56:51.833 --> 56:54.125
What? No.

56:56.916 --> 57:01.416
The cheese-- cheese is still melting,

57:01.500 --> 57:02.708
but you should try this.

57:05.291 --> 57:06.916
-Hot.
-Mm.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.583
It is my take on migas.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.625
-Mmm.
-Yep.

57:11.708 --> 57:13.666
Homemade tortilla chips,
caramelized onions,

57:13.750 --> 57:15.416
peppers, eggs,

57:15.500 --> 57:17.583
anything really
that I want to put on there.

57:17.666 --> 57:19.250
Oh, you want cilantro?

57:19.333 --> 57:20.750
No. Never.

57:20.833 --> 57:23.083
Really?

57:23.166 --> 57:24.833
-You like cilantro?
-I love cilantro.

57:24.916 --> 57:28.000
-Oh, no.
-You think you know someone.

57:28.083 --> 57:31.083
Well, I didn't know you were such a chef.

57:31.166 --> 57:35.708
Yeah, uh, it's what I wanted
to be when I was younger.

57:37.083 --> 57:39.375
It's just not the same cooking for one.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.833
Well, you're really good at it.

57:44.750 --> 57:46.500
When I woke up I realized…

57:48.083 --> 57:50.291
…I don't want just one night with you.

57:51.541 --> 57:52.708
But…

57:58.166 --> 57:59.291
No buts.

58:23.916 --> 58:25.708
All right, go.

59:16.250 --> 59:18.333
That's it. Light on your feet.

59:20.083 --> 59:22.625
-You're late.
-Sorry, boss, uh, we--

59:22.708 --> 59:25.541
Got caught up in each other?
Forgot what you're meant to be doing?

59:25.625 --> 59:28.833
I mean, if you're not gonna take this
seriously, find somewhere else to train.

59:28.916 --> 59:30.583
-Come on.
-Okay? I gave you the conditions, okay?

59:30.666 --> 59:32.000
I said keep it professional.

59:32.083 --> 59:33.583
But you didn't do that, did you?

59:33.666 --> 59:36.458
We've been down this road before, Sienna.

59:39.208 --> 59:40.625
Julian, come on.

59:40.708 --> 59:42.833
Give me a jab. Jab cross.

59:42.916 --> 59:44.750
Look, I really do need your help.

59:44.833 --> 59:46.708
You don't know what you need.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.333
And somebody is gonna get hurt, Sienna.

59:48.416 --> 59:50.458
Sir, this is just as much
my fault as it is hers.

59:50.541 --> 59:51.875
Hey, this is between us.

59:51.958 --> 59:54.291
Jab. Switch.

59:56.625 --> 59:58.791
Oh, nice shot.

59:58.875 --> 59:59.875
Come on.

1:00:01.250 --> 1:00:02.958
Julian, I'm really sorry.

1:00:06.041 --> 1:00:07.708
I am.

1:00:07.791 --> 1:00:09.416
Did you see Jax's fight the other night?

1:00:14.833 --> 1:00:15.833
It's all over the Internet.

1:00:23.833 --> 1:00:25.583
Oh!

1:00:33.833 --> 1:00:37.708
…to take on Kayden "The Killer" Williams!

1:00:38.458 --> 1:00:40.208
You really want to be a part of this?

1:00:40.291 --> 1:00:41.958
You're gonna get yourself killed.

1:00:43.750 --> 1:00:46.000
You got one week.

1:00:46.083 --> 1:00:48.125
Are you ready to send him into that?

1:00:50.708 --> 1:00:51.916
We'll be ready.

1:00:57.041 --> 1:01:00.833
Buckle down and you can stay,

1:01:00.916 --> 1:01:02.708
but no more warnings.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:31.541
Uh-huh.

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:37.625
Nice. Yep, down.

1:01:37.708 --> 1:01:39.083
Nice.

1:02:00.083 --> 1:02:01.541
That's good.

1:02:01.625 --> 1:02:03.541
Hey, can you give us a hand for a sec?

1:02:03.625 --> 1:02:05.250
Yeah, sure. Keep going.

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:07.166
Make sure you switch up the angles.

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:11.000
Okay, this is Athena.
She's got a fight coming up.

1:02:11.083 --> 1:02:12.541
I wanna get her on her feet.

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:15.000
Yeah. Sure.

1:02:17.625 --> 1:02:21.333
Okay, ladies, you ready?

1:02:21.416 --> 1:02:23.875
Okay, touch gloves.

1:02:23.958 --> 1:02:25.166
And go!

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.500
Bring her to you, Athena.

1:02:35.666 --> 1:02:37.125
Cover.

1:02:39.708 --> 1:02:40.916
Use the ring.

1:02:43.625 --> 1:02:45.458
Step back.

1:02:47.791 --> 1:02:50.333
Watch those leg kicks and don't project.

1:03:09.250 --> 1:03:11.333
Nice. Good kick.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:17.416
Keep your guard up.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:18.625
Cover. Come on.

1:03:18.708 --> 1:03:20.708
Athena, use the fence.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.958
Keep going. The foot--

1:03:32.041 --> 1:03:33.708
Take her to ground.

1:03:39.291 --> 1:03:40.541
Okay, get off the ropes.

1:03:42.291 --> 1:03:44.083
Come on, take it.

1:03:45.125 --> 1:03:46.833
Fight your way out.

1:04:20.375 --> 1:04:21.708
Good fight.

1:04:29.625 --> 1:04:30.625
What?

1:04:32.458 --> 1:04:35.208
-It's nothing.
-It was nothing?

1:04:35.291 --> 1:04:37.166
She's won all three fights this year.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:39.708
You just took her down.

1:04:41.708 --> 1:04:43.708
It's nothing.

1:04:47.500 --> 1:04:49.666
Well, let me know when
you're ready to get serious.

1:04:54.500 --> 1:04:56.083
I didn't say stop.

1:05:08.083 --> 1:05:09.500
Wow.

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:19.666
Need some help?

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.208
Yeah, you know how to do this?

1:05:23.291 --> 1:05:26.000
No, not really.

1:05:26.083 --> 1:05:28.208
But I YouTubed it,

1:05:28.291 --> 1:05:30.916
so let's see.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000
Mm-hmm.

1:05:33.083 --> 1:05:35.083
This one goes behind.

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:37.708
Across.

1:05:42.708 --> 1:05:43.916
There.

1:05:49.916 --> 1:05:50.916
All right.

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:59.875
Look at you. Look at you.

1:06:05.916 --> 1:06:09.041
I'm really glad we stayed
for the reception.

1:06:09.125 --> 1:06:13.208
Slink off to the shadows
when things get social?

1:06:13.291 --> 1:06:14.625
-It's not me.
-Oh, yeah.

1:06:14.708 --> 1:06:16.416
-You? I'm very social.
-No.

1:06:16.500 --> 1:06:18.208
Oh, yeah, definitely.

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:24.083
I've missed this.

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:26.916
I'm here.

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.291
Forever?

1:06:32.916 --> 1:06:34.083
I mean it.

1:06:35.750 --> 1:06:38.291
Do you really see that happening for us?

1:06:41.625 --> 1:06:43.500
Go big or go home, lucky.

1:06:58.083 --> 1:07:00.083
There she is.

1:07:01.291 --> 1:07:03.708
You clean up nice, princess.

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:08.500
Come on. I can't even get a hello?

1:07:10.291 --> 1:07:13.291
-Did Beth invite you?
-Beth?

1:07:15.166 --> 1:07:17.208
-I'm kidding.
-Ha, ha.

1:07:17.291 --> 1:07:19.416
Women are disposable.
You're a real comedian.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.875
Si, now that's what I love about you.

1:07:21.958 --> 1:07:24.041
Never afraid to tell it like it is.

1:07:24.125 --> 1:07:26.291
I miss that fire.

1:07:28.833 --> 1:07:32.291
I don't know, maybe this wedding stuff
is making me all sentimental.

1:07:34.291 --> 1:07:36.500
-This was supposed to be us.
-Mm.

1:07:37.791 --> 1:07:41.625
Me and you? Rebel champions?

1:07:41.708 --> 1:07:45.333
Rebels stand for something.
You can't even stand up.

1:07:45.416 --> 1:07:47.083
Okay, Jax, you need to go home.

1:07:47.166 --> 1:07:51.125
Sienna, Sienna, I know I'm not perfect.

1:07:51.208 --> 1:07:55.541
Neither of us were. But we were good.

1:07:55.625 --> 1:07:57.083
We could be great.

1:07:58.708 --> 1:07:59.916
I know it.

1:08:01.500 --> 1:08:04.625
How many times
do I have to tell you I'm done?

1:08:04.708 --> 1:08:07.291
It's kinda mixed signals
when you keep coming back.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.333
Well, consider this me breaking the cycle.

1:08:12.125 --> 1:08:14.125
-What's going on, Sienna?
-Come on, let's just go.

1:08:14.208 --> 1:08:16.958
You know she's just using you
to get back at me, right?

1:08:17.041 --> 1:08:20.208
What, are you hurt?

1:08:20.291 --> 1:08:22.000
You thought there was something more?

1:08:22.083 --> 1:08:23.291
That's not how she operates.

1:08:23.375 --> 1:08:25.416
She may look like she's on the sidelines,

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:27.250
-but she's the one calling the shots.
-Jax, stop.

1:08:27.333 --> 1:08:30.000
You're a pawn, dude.
I'll prove it to you right now.

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:31.750
-Fight me.
-Let's go.

1:08:31.833 --> 1:08:33.958
See if she sticks around afterwards.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.958
I'm not gonna fight you, man.
This is a wedding.

1:08:37.041 --> 1:08:39.208
Respect the families.
Save it for tomorrow.

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:41.125
The fuck do you know
about respecting family?

1:08:41.208 --> 1:08:43.708
Killed yours, didn't you? Your mom, right?

1:08:50.291 --> 1:08:52.125
-Motherfucker.
-Hey!

1:09:09.375 --> 1:09:12.208
-Get off.
-Dude. Hey, calm down.

1:09:12.291 --> 1:09:15.625
-Fuck!
-Go on. Get out of here.

1:09:15.708 --> 1:09:17.625
Get over here. I'll fucking kill you.

1:09:23.458 --> 1:09:25.625
-No!
-You need to get out.

1:09:25.708 --> 1:09:27.250
Get off me!

1:09:27.333 --> 1:09:29.416
-Let me see. Let me see.
-Kayden!

1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:31.416
You guys enjoying the show?

1:09:38.666 --> 1:09:41.083
Seriously, dude, what is wrong with you?

1:09:43.458 --> 1:09:46.208
-Kayden. Kayden, wait!
-Fuck that guy.

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:48.625
He doesn't know
anything about me or my mom

1:09:48.708 --> 1:09:51.625
-or my life or any--
-Neither do I.

1:09:51.708 --> 1:09:55.125
So talk to me. Tell me.

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:07.541
That's my mom, okay?

1:10:07.625 --> 1:10:09.916
She raised me by herself.

1:10:10.958 --> 1:10:12.833
She worked three jobs
to keep food on the table,

1:10:12.916 --> 1:10:14.250
and I was just a piece of shit.

1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:17.208
One night, I got really drunk at a party,

1:10:17.291 --> 1:10:20.083
and, uh, she left work to come find me,

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:23.375
and on the way
she got hit by a drunk driver.

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:26.625
-And just like that, gone.
-You couldn't have known--

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:30.041
And everything that she did for me?
That's how I repaid her.

1:10:30.125 --> 1:10:31.833
Now I'm just a high school dropout

1:10:31.916 --> 1:10:33.625
that gets beat up in
underground fights for money.

1:10:33.708 --> 1:10:35.750
She'd be really proud of that,
wouldn't she?

1:10:39.833 --> 1:10:43.208
What do you want from me, Sienna?

1:10:43.291 --> 1:10:45.833
I put everything that I have
into these fights.

1:10:46.791 --> 1:10:49.833
Everything. What do you want?

1:10:49.916 --> 1:10:52.833
'Cause I have nothing left to give,

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:55.375
and I am not gonna be
another person's charity case.

1:10:55.458 --> 1:10:59.083
You're not a charity case, Kayden.

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.833
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't! No, no, no.

1:11:03.916 --> 1:11:07.708
No, no.
That is the last thing I want-- pity.

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:11.125
Definitely not yours,

1:11:13.041 --> 1:11:16.458
from the way you pity yourself so much
it keeps you chasing that asshole.

1:11:16.541 --> 1:11:18.500
Excuse me?

1:11:18.583 --> 1:11:22.166
You think you're so tough,
but you're just hiding.

1:11:22.250 --> 1:11:25.000
Oh, says-- says the brave hero

1:11:25.083 --> 1:11:26.875
just locked up in a basement

1:11:26.958 --> 1:11:28.958
haunted by his own ghost waiting to die.

1:11:29.041 --> 1:11:32.625
You forced your way into my life!

1:11:32.708 --> 1:11:35.000
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't need you.

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:38.000
Really? You don't need me? Because
the last fight before me, you lost.

1:11:38.083 --> 1:11:39.916
-Wait.
-Ouch.

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:44.708
-That feels broken.
-Don't.

1:11:44.791 --> 1:11:48.208
I'm gonna do this on my own.
Don't come tomorrow.

1:11:48.291 --> 1:11:51.000
Tomorrow? What?
You can't fight with a broken rib.

1:11:51.083 --> 1:11:53.000
What does it matter to you if I lose?

1:11:53.083 --> 1:11:56.416
'Cause we don't have anything
after tomorrow, do we?

1:12:07.125 --> 1:12:09.708
Have fun on your suicide mission!

1:12:13.916 --> 1:12:15.291
Fuck.

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.708
You heading out?

1:13:07.583 --> 1:13:09.375
You're a professional, Sienna.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:12.875
We don't abandon our fighters.

1:13:13.875 --> 1:13:15.625
Let's get through this fight,

1:13:15.708 --> 1:13:17.791
and then we'll focus on the next chapter.

1:13:17.875 --> 1:13:20.708
But tonight he needs you.

1:13:40.916 --> 1:13:42.916
-You need a hand?
-Julian.

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:46.833
I thought you didn't want
anyone to know about this.

1:13:46.916 --> 1:13:48.208
Well, you know, fuck 'em.

1:13:55.916 --> 1:13:58.625
Hey, what the hell happened?
That's a crack.

1:13:58.708 --> 1:14:00.958
You can't fight like that.

1:14:01.041 --> 1:14:02.625
Pacquiao did it. I'll be fine.

1:14:02.708 --> 1:14:05.208
You know, if he gets a hit in,
it'll puncture a lung.

1:14:05.291 --> 1:14:08.416
-It could be fatal.
-Then I better not let him hit me.

1:14:10.708 --> 1:14:14.333
Next up, The Killer!

1:14:14.416 --> 1:14:16.708
You have any last words of advice?

1:14:17.875 --> 1:14:19.625
Win.

1:14:20.541 --> 1:14:24.000
-You got this, man.
-You got this, Killer. Come on, man.

1:14:24.083 --> 1:14:27.000
Kayden "The Killer" Williams
makes his way to the cage

1:14:27.083 --> 1:14:30.208
to face off Jax "Deadbeat" Deneris

1:14:30.291 --> 1:14:33.416
in the showdown of the century!

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:43.416
Come on, brother, you got this!
You got this!

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:44.791
Come on, brother!

1:14:44.875 --> 1:14:45.875
This is it, folks,

1:14:45.958 --> 1:14:48.166
the moment you've been waiting for!

1:14:48.250 --> 1:14:49.708
Ready?

1:14:49.791 --> 1:14:53.041
Yo! Oh, that was dirty!

1:15:02.250 --> 1:15:05.416
-Stay ahead. Nice.
-Hey.

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:08.416
Hey. I didn't think you'd come
after last night.

1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:10.250
I didn't think so either,

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:12.333
but I couldn't let him do it alone.

1:15:18.916 --> 1:15:21.208
I'm sorry we ruined the night.

1:15:21.291 --> 1:15:23.083
You didn't. Jax did.

1:15:23.166 --> 1:15:25.583
Kayden! Get off the cage! Cover up!

1:15:26.833 --> 1:15:28.416
-Come on!
-Off the cage!

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:30.500
-Come on!
-Come on, Kayden.

1:15:33.250 --> 1:15:34.708
-Off the cage!
-Find the opening!

1:15:36.791 --> 1:15:38.416
Hold him! Don't let him go!

1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:40.291
-Hold that.
-Squeeze, squeeze.

1:15:46.291 --> 1:15:47.916
Come on! Squeeze!

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.666
Watch the leg. Watch the leg.

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:53.750
Come on!

1:15:53.833 --> 1:15:56.125
There you go!

1:15:56.208 --> 1:15:58.000
Come on.

1:16:16.541 --> 1:16:18.875
His ribs!

1:16:20.250 --> 1:16:22.041
You can do better than that.

1:16:22.125 --> 1:16:23.708
Come on, Killer. Get up!

1:16:23.791 --> 1:16:26.250
-Kayden, you're okay. It's his ribs.
-Aw, Kayden…

1:16:26.333 --> 1:16:30.291
This is your guy?
He's the best you got at UFG?

1:16:30.375 --> 1:16:32.083
Come on, Kayden, you're okay.

1:16:37.083 --> 1:16:38.708
Breathe.

1:16:38.791 --> 1:16:42.416
This guy? This guy?

1:16:46.541 --> 1:16:49.083
I thought you came to fight, Killer.

1:16:53.291 --> 1:16:56.625
In that moment,
I realized it didn't matter anymore

1:16:56.708 --> 1:16:58.500
whether we beat Jax.

1:17:00.375 --> 1:17:01.750
We had each other.

1:17:04.583 --> 1:17:06.125
We'd already won.

1:17:13.333 --> 1:17:16.500
Killer's back on his feet.

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:18.125
He's not ready to give up.

1:17:21.666 --> 1:17:23.916
-Nice! Off the cage!
-You got this. Stay grounded!

1:18:05.083 --> 1:18:06.750
Go.

1:18:13.708 --> 1:18:16.000
Yes!

1:18:16.083 --> 1:18:17.625
The Killer wins!

1:18:17.708 --> 1:18:21.125
Yes!

1:18:21.208 --> 1:18:23.333
The defending champion…

1:18:24.333 --> 1:18:26.625
Remember when I said
winning didn't matter?

1:18:26.708 --> 1:18:27.708
I meant it.

1:18:27.791 --> 1:18:31.500
But, damn, this felt good.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:37.291
Killer, Killer, Killer, Killer, Killer!

1:18:38.416 --> 1:18:40.208
You did it.

1:18:40.291 --> 1:18:41.708
We did it.

1:18:44.958 --> 1:18:48.625
And this felt even better.

1:18:59.791 --> 1:19:01.750
Killer!

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:12.000
Oh, my God. Is she breathing?

1:19:12.083 --> 1:19:13.916
Sienna. Come on.

1:19:15.208 --> 1:19:17.291
Please, please, please, don't do this.

1:19:17.375 --> 1:19:19.166
Fuck, man. Fuck!

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.958
Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!

1:19:30.291 --> 1:19:33.750
Dr. Robertson to the ER immediately.

1:20:13.291 --> 1:20:14.583
You guys, she's up.

1:20:15.791 --> 1:20:18.083
Sienna, can you hear me?

1:20:18.166 --> 1:20:21.333
It's Beth. I'm right here.

1:20:21.416 --> 1:20:23.375
You've been out for, like, three days.

1:20:26.166 --> 1:20:28.083
Can we-- can we get you anything?

1:20:30.666 --> 1:20:33.125
Go on your honeymoon.

1:20:35.166 --> 1:20:38.583
We got her. Go. It's fine.

1:20:45.708 --> 1:20:49.000
-You're gonna be okay.
-Where is he?

1:20:49.083 --> 1:20:52.583
He waited
until you were in the clear, but…

1:20:54.875 --> 1:20:56.916
He left you this.

1:21:12.291 --> 1:21:15.458
I've always known there's danger
in loving someone too much,

1:21:15.541 --> 1:21:18.041
the daily sacrifices
that turn into so much more.

1:21:18.125 --> 1:21:19.333
It's okay.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:21.416
Holding you in my arms,

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:23.833
I saw what I was doing to you,

1:21:23.916 --> 1:21:28.375
and I know that if--
when you come back from this,

1:21:29.291 --> 1:21:31.208
you'll continue to put yourself
in my shadow

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:33.625
just as you did with Jax.

1:21:33.708 --> 1:21:35.791
You deserve so much more than that,

1:21:36.875 --> 1:21:39.291
and I can be a part of holding you back.

1:21:40.666 --> 1:21:43.291
You're one of the great ones, Sienna.

1:22:02.208 --> 1:22:03.208
Hey.

1:22:08.875 --> 1:22:11.291
Looks like our roles are reversed, huh?

1:22:12.916 --> 1:22:14.833
You gonna nurse me back to health?

1:22:14.916 --> 1:22:17.541
If you want.

1:22:17.625 --> 1:22:19.000
I'll be here for you every day.

1:22:19.083 --> 1:22:23.458
Seriously? You could've
saved yourself the trip.

1:22:24.791 --> 1:22:27.291
No, it's not actually why I'm here,

1:22:27.375 --> 1:22:28.833
but you did ask.

1:22:28.916 --> 1:22:32.375
-You saw an opening?
-Pretty much.

1:22:34.375 --> 1:22:36.291
Cookie?

1:22:42.666 --> 1:22:43.916
Okay.

1:22:47.333 --> 1:22:48.916
I, um…

1:22:53.541 --> 1:22:55.625
I came to say that I'm sorry.

1:22:56.708 --> 1:22:58.208
It was an accident.

1:22:58.291 --> 1:23:00.208
I didn't see you, Sienna.

1:23:00.291 --> 1:23:02.708
And by the time that I did see you…

1:23:04.083 --> 1:23:07.208
The thought that I could've killed you…

1:23:07.291 --> 1:23:10.375
Yeah. You could have.

1:23:15.583 --> 1:23:17.708
But I…

1:23:19.500 --> 1:23:23.666
I forgive you for everything.

1:23:23.750 --> 1:23:27.458
-I love you.
-No, you don't.

1:23:28.166 --> 1:23:30.875
You took my anger,
and you tried to control me with it,

1:23:30.958 --> 1:23:35.333
and you called that love,
and that's not what love is.

1:23:35.416 --> 1:23:38.291
But that doesn't mean
that you can never find it.

1:23:40.083 --> 1:23:42.833
You just have to look
inside yourself, Jax.

1:23:44.875 --> 1:23:47.625
Just try to fix
what's broken inside of you

1:23:48.541 --> 1:23:50.583
and stop trying to break other people

1:23:50.666 --> 1:23:52.291
to make yourself feel whole.

1:23:55.708 --> 1:23:57.333
Can I ask you something?

1:23:57.416 --> 1:23:59.708
You think there's still a chance?

1:23:59.791 --> 1:24:02.000
Of what?

1:24:03.083 --> 1:24:04.958
For me to be redeemed?

1:24:07.583 --> 1:24:09.541
No one is beyond redemption.

1:24:12.375 --> 1:24:14.333
But I wouldn't bet my money on it.

1:24:14.416 --> 1:24:17.166
Yeah.

1:24:27.208 --> 1:24:28.916
You're probably right.

1:24:37.708 --> 1:24:41.500
It hurt, hearing those words,

1:24:42.541 --> 1:24:44.250
feeling abandoned,

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:48.708
but it hurt even more
knowing he was right.

1:24:50.916 --> 1:24:52.250
The first step in recovery

1:24:52.333 --> 1:24:54.958
is admitting you have a problem.

1:24:56.541 --> 1:24:59.125
I was an addict.

1:25:02.333 --> 1:25:06.583
I'd been obsessed with Jax,
convinced it was love,

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:08.083
and my need for revenge

1:25:08.166 --> 1:25:10.625
had thrown me even further off track.

1:25:10.708 --> 1:25:14.000
With Kayden it felt different,

1:25:14.083 --> 1:25:15.625
but I was still fighting for others

1:25:15.708 --> 1:25:17.458
when I needed to fight for myself.

1:25:23.416 --> 1:25:25.291
I'd lost sight of who I was,

1:25:26.166 --> 1:25:27.500
what I wanted.

1:25:52.333 --> 1:25:54.166
I wasn't one to forget,

1:25:54.958 --> 1:25:57.125
but it cost me nothing to forgive.

1:26:03.666 --> 1:26:05.958
All right.

1:26:06.041 --> 1:26:09.750
-Not gourmet, but here you go.
-Thank you.

1:26:09.833 --> 1:26:13.458
-Mm-hmm.
-I like your hair.

1:26:13.541 --> 1:26:16.708
-It's very me, right?
-Yeah.

1:26:26.125 --> 1:26:28.375
I ended things with Jax.

1:26:31.291 --> 1:26:33.416
Well, aren't you gonna say I told you so?

1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.791
I'm so proud of you.

1:26:40.916 --> 1:26:43.166
Thanks, Si.

1:26:43.916 --> 1:26:46.750
Now you've gotta focus on yourself.

1:26:47.625 --> 1:26:48.958
I am.

1:26:58.375 --> 1:27:01.208
Hey, whoa! Easy there, killer.

1:27:01.291 --> 1:27:02.875
Hey, I'm not Killer.

1:27:02.958 --> 1:27:06.666
-What'd he call you? Lucky?
-Exactly. It's ironic.

1:27:06.750 --> 1:27:09.958
-Go again?
-Slow and steady.

1:27:25.625 --> 1:27:27.541
I'll give you a minute.

1:27:35.916 --> 1:27:39.416
-You look good up there.
-That? I was just warming up.

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.166
Heard you were in Philly.

1:27:42.250 --> 1:27:44.916
Yeah. Yeah, I have an uncle up there.

1:27:45.875 --> 1:27:47.916
I'm glad it worked out for you.

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.208
I just figured you be better off

1:27:50.291 --> 1:27:52.791
if I wasn't here messing everything up.

1:27:54.083 --> 1:27:57.125
-How selfless.
-I know. I know.

1:27:57.208 --> 1:27:59.666
Now I know that running away

1:27:59.750 --> 1:28:02.541
was exactly the wrong thing to do.

1:28:03.541 --> 1:28:05.583
And I was a coward.

1:28:07.458 --> 1:28:08.458
I'm sorry.

1:28:10.208 --> 1:28:12.666
I'm sorry that I ran away
when you needed me the most.

1:28:12.750 --> 1:28:15.166
And if you can't forgive me, that's okay.

1:28:15.250 --> 1:28:17.708
I just want what's best for you.

1:28:20.708 --> 1:28:23.375
I love you, Sienna.

1:28:24.500 --> 1:28:26.416
I'm happy you're fighting.

1:28:30.291 --> 1:28:33.083
I'd wish you luck, but who needs it when
they got your skills?

1:28:37.583 --> 1:28:39.458
I read your letter.

1:28:42.541 --> 1:28:44.416
I'm not gonna lie, I was so mad.

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:48.791
But I was just holding on to that anger
towards Jax,

1:28:48.875 --> 1:28:51.833
and it was holding me back.

1:28:51.916 --> 1:28:57.125
So, I don't know,
maybe I should be thanking you.

1:28:57.208 --> 1:29:02.916
Well, no, but, um, you know what I mean.

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:08.041
I'm not doing the underground
thing anymore.

1:29:09.416 --> 1:29:10.833
I applied to school in the fall.

1:29:10.916 --> 1:29:13.083
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:29:13.166 --> 1:29:15.833
-That's really good.
-Yeah.

1:29:15.916 --> 1:29:19.291
Um, in Philly?

1:29:21.291 --> 1:29:22.541
Springfield.

1:29:22.625 --> 1:29:27.208
So if you happen to know anyone

1:29:27.291 --> 1:29:30.416
with a cheap room to rent,

1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:33.083
I'd love a recommendation.

1:29:36.375 --> 1:29:38.583
How's it going, Julian?

1:29:38.666 --> 1:29:41.291
Well, it's still slow,

1:29:41.375 --> 1:29:43.958
but I appreciate you
leaving me what you did.

1:29:44.041 --> 1:29:46.250
It's not a fight
that I wanted any credit for,

1:29:46.333 --> 1:29:49.166
but it's been keeping my lights on,

1:29:50.333 --> 1:29:53.208
putting off the inevitable, I suppose.

1:29:53.291 --> 1:29:55.291
Not if you have a champion.

1:29:55.375 --> 1:29:58.208
You thinking about turning pro?

1:29:59.500 --> 1:30:00.916
Not him.

1:30:12.500 --> 1:30:13.500
Me.
