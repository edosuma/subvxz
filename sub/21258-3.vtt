WEBVTT

00:01.109 --> 00:02.568
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made.

00:02.569 --> 00:05.310
Because when people are trying,
they know they're trying!

00:05.311 --> 00:07.247
And just because no one
ever wants to try with you

00:07.248 --> 00:08.748
doesn't give you the right

00:08.750 --> 00:10.516
to tell me how to run
my associates!

00:10.518 --> 00:12.485
I think Rachel should
handle the associates.

00:12.487 --> 00:15.021
I am up here;
Rachel's down here.

00:15.023 --> 00:16.422
And you don't give dominion
over the associates

00:16.424 --> 00:18.190
to someone down here.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.592
Which one of my clients
are you after?

00:19.594 --> 00:21.360
Because we both know
you can't have Pfizer.

00:21.362 --> 00:23.496
- Yes, I can.
- Then make me name partner.

00:23.498 --> 00:25.331
Harvey's making his friend
name partner.

00:25.333 --> 00:26.766
He's accused me
of being jealous,

00:26.768 --> 00:28.467
and I don't know what to do.

00:28.469 --> 00:30.469
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I'm goddamn jealous!

00:30.471 --> 00:33.572
If you keep letting your
emotions dictate your behavior,

00:33.574 --> 00:36.308
you won't need to worry
about being replaced.

00:36.310 --> 00:38.477
You'll drive Harvey away
all by yourself.

00:38.479 --> 00:40.813
Stop apologizing
and start intimidating.

00:40.815 --> 00:42.214
That's a hell of a slogan,
Harvey,

00:42.216 --> 00:43.783
but what does it actually mean?

00:43.785 --> 00:45.785
It means you go out,
you find a reporter,

00:45.787 --> 00:47.486
and you control the narrative.

00:47.488 --> 00:49.522
If I lose this case,
the only article that's

00:49.524 --> 00:51.357
gonna get written is that
I never should've been able

00:51.359 --> 00:53.059
to practice law
in the first place.

00:53.061 --> 00:55.161
If you can't figure out
a way to win,

00:55.163 --> 00:56.796
<i>maybe I shouldn't have brought</i>
<i>you back in the first place.</i>

00:56.798 --> 00:58.397
A reporter from
the "Times" is coming here.

00:58.399 --> 01:00.232
We are doing an interview:

01:00.234 --> 01:02.635
"The Redemption
of a Fraudulent Lawyer."

01:02.637 --> 01:05.137
I don't want my behavior

01:05.138 --> 01:06.605
to drive a wedge between us,

01:06.607 --> 01:09.141
which means I accept Alex
as name partner.

01:09.143 --> 01:10.543
For what it's worth,
Alex is still coming,

01:10.545 --> 01:12.078
but not as name partner.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.479
- Really?
- You're right.

01:13.481 --> 01:15.001
We can't water down
the firm like that.

01:18.653 --> 01:21.854
I have to say... [laughs]

01:21.856 --> 01:23.856
I've been wanting this
for so long.

01:23.858 --> 01:27.560
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think it would come true.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.330
We're the only name partners
now, Louis.

01:31.332 --> 01:33.566
And I meant it
when I said it.

01:33.568 --> 01:35.434
I want us to share
things like this.

01:35.436 --> 01:38.537
I can't tell you how
happy that makes me.

01:38.539 --> 01:40.406
You're not gonna
cry, are you?

01:40.408 --> 01:41.440
Are you kidding?
The last time I cried in here,

01:41.442 --> 01:43.109
I messed up the pH.

01:43.111 --> 01:44.577
I had a yeast infection
for weeks.

01:44.579 --> 01:46.445
You're not gonna do the other
thing you told me

01:46.447 --> 01:48.547
you did in the mud, are you?

01:48.549 --> 01:50.649
Harvey, I told you,
that was a one-time thing.

01:50.651 --> 01:52.518
And believe me,
you're no Missy Dietler.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.286
Who's Missy Dietler?

01:54.288 --> 01:56.655
- What is he doing here?
- What do you mean?

01:56.657 --> 01:58.691
Harvey and I go mudding together
all the time.

01:58.693 --> 02:00.392
So why don't you lug yourself
out of there

02:00.394 --> 02:03.129
so I can get my tub back?
This is my tub.

02:03.131 --> 02:04.597
And you always told me it was
weird for male friends

02:04.599 --> 02:06.465
to mud together.

02:06.467 --> 02:09.201
But Harvey and I are
more than just friends.

02:09.203 --> 02:10.369
We're best friends.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.608
And then what did you do?

02:15.610 --> 02:17.143
What do you think I did?
I called you.

02:17.145 --> 02:19.345
Louis, it was just a dream.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.347
Just a dream?
It was a goddamn mud-mare.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.681
Don't you get it?

02:22.683 --> 02:24.350
Harvey let his buddy
into my firm.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.185
Now he's in my mud.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.553
I mean, what's next?
I walk into my bathroom

02:27.555 --> 02:28.888
and I find him shitting
on my toothbrush?

02:28.890 --> 02:30.456
Louis, we talked about this.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.424
If you let this
overwhelm you,

02:32.426 --> 02:35.361
you're going to bring about
the thing you're most afraid of.

02:36.564 --> 02:38.164
Did you hear me?

02:38.166 --> 02:39.932
He was in my mud.

02:39.934 --> 02:42.434
How the hell am I not supposed
to let that overwhelm me?

02:42.436 --> 02:44.270
Well...

02:44.272 --> 02:46.238
has it occurred to you

02:46.240 --> 02:48.908
that instead of worrying
this Alex person

02:48.910 --> 02:51.510
is going to come between you
and Harvey,

02:51.512 --> 02:54.313
you could use this
as an opportunity

02:54.315 --> 02:56.649
to make a new friend?

02:56.651 --> 02:58.684
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

02:58.686 --> 03:00.319
Be that as it may,

03:00.321 --> 03:02.254
as I see it,

03:02.256 --> 03:05.257
you have a chance to have
one more friend

03:05.259 --> 03:07.259
or one less friend.

03:07.261 --> 03:09.261
I suggest you go with one more.

03:09.263 --> 03:12.965
<i>[soft dramatic music]</i>

03:12.967 --> 03:14.300
- Donna.
- Rachel.

03:14.302 --> 03:16.302
Can I get you two
anything?

03:16.304 --> 03:18.737
Coffee, tea, a copy of your
article in the "Sunday Times"?

03:18.739 --> 03:21.307
Don't need it. Read it
yesterday. Have one at home.

03:21.309 --> 03:23.309
And by one, he means ten.

03:23.311 --> 03:24.643
Are you sure you don't want to
take just one more look at it?

03:24.645 --> 03:26.512
I'm good.
Thanks, Donna.

03:26.514 --> 03:28.314
Okeydokey.

03:28.316 --> 03:29.415
You have a nice day.

03:30.785 --> 03:33.485
Something's going on with her,
I can tell.

03:33.487 --> 03:35.487
What do you mean?

03:35.489 --> 03:38.257
You telling me you didn't
notice that grin on her face?

03:38.259 --> 03:40.259
Rachel, you've known Donna
longer than I have,

03:40.261 --> 03:41.660
but I didn't see a grin.

03:41.662 --> 03:43.422
I'm telling you,
I think you're imagining it.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.800
Right. Totally imagined it.

03:47.802 --> 03:50.336
Harvey.
Rachel.

03:50.338 --> 03:52.404
You know,
black can be slimming.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.273
Something to think about
next time.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.674
I take it this is your
way of apologizing

03:55.676 --> 03:57.676
for saying you never
should've hired me back.

03:57.678 --> 03:59.778
And it gave me a chance to say
the slimming thing.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.549
Sorry, Mike.

04:03.551 --> 04:05.317
You had a point, Harvey.

04:10.324 --> 04:11.991
This is the Radiant
Technologies merger.

04:11.993 --> 04:13.659
Yep. Back to one for me.

04:13.661 --> 04:15.594
Great, except you don't
need me for this.

04:15.596 --> 04:17.529
Deal's done.
They sign tomorrow.

04:17.531 --> 04:19.832
Which is why Klein Robinson
thought that I wouldn't mind

04:19.834 --> 04:22.034
if they put a few last-minute
changes in the contract.

04:22.036 --> 04:23.736
And a few last-minute changes
means they're trying to pull

04:23.738 --> 04:25.638
some last-minute bullshit.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.039
Now that sounds like
the impressive young lawyer

04:27.041 --> 04:28.774
I read about in the article.

04:28.776 --> 04:30.376
Why don't you figure out
what they're trying to do?

04:30.378 --> 04:32.678
And get it done by lunch.

04:35.850 --> 04:37.549

05:18.660 --> 05:20.026
Louis, what are you doing?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.060
- What?
- Leave him alone.

05:21.062 --> 05:22.662
It's his first day.

05:22.664 --> 05:23.663
No, Donna, it's not like that.
I come in peace.

05:23.665 --> 05:25.098
You swear?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.766
Yes, I brought him
a living thing.

05:26.768 --> 05:29.168
- Is it poisonous?
- No, Donna, it is not.

05:29.170 --> 05:31.838
Okay. Well, I got
my eyes on you.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.040
And that plant.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.109
[exhales heavily]
Don't be hostile.

05:37.312 --> 05:39.145
Alex Williams, Louis Litt.

05:39.147 --> 05:40.146
I brought you a honeysuckle.

05:40.148 --> 05:42.215
Excuse me?

05:42.217 --> 05:44.651
It's a gesture, since we
might've gotten off

05:44.653 --> 05:46.319
on the wrong foot.

05:46.321 --> 05:47.720
You mean because you tried
to poach my biggest client

05:47.722 --> 05:49.322
and keep me from joining
the firm?

05:49.324 --> 05:51.424
Yes, perhaps that's the foot
we got off on.

05:51.426 --> 05:55.094
But I was hoping we could
get onto other foot.

05:55.096 --> 05:57.163
Here.

05:57.165 --> 05:59.866
I appreciate the gesture,
Louis.

05:59.868 --> 06:03.770
By the way, your work on the
Andersen case was extraordinary.

06:03.772 --> 06:05.738
You followed my Andersen work?

06:05.740 --> 06:08.408
Yes. In fact, it reminded me
of my Pricehouse strategy.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.210
Truth be told, I based it
on your Pricehouse strategy.

06:11.212 --> 06:13.446
Get the f--well then, you took
it to a whole other level.

06:13.448 --> 06:15.682
[chuckles]
Thank you, Louis.

06:16.885 --> 06:19.152
I'm sorry about the poaching.

06:19.154 --> 06:20.687
Don't worry about it.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.855
[sighs contentedly]

06:22.857 --> 06:25.291
Hey, would you
like to grab lunch?

06:25.293 --> 06:28.361
Eating at your desk is no way to
celebrate your first day.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.329
You're right, it's not.

06:30.331 --> 06:31.898
I'll meet you at the lobby
at 1:00.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.800
Sounds good.
And thanks for the plant.

06:33.802 --> 06:35.702
You're welcome.

06:35.704 --> 06:37.270
I don't know if you care
about this, but cats love it.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.405
Oh, I know.
We've got two tabbies at home

06:39.407 --> 06:40.940
that are gonna go crazy
over that bad boy.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.709
- Tabbies?
- Yup.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.444
Holy shit, I'm gonna make
a reservation

06:44.446 --> 06:47.480
at the best restaurant
in the city, you... BFF, you.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.183
Son of a bitch.

06:52.487 --> 06:53.886
Mr. Reyes?

06:53.888 --> 06:55.755
- Yes.
- Mike Ross.

06:55.757 --> 06:57.223
They said you
wanted to see me?

06:57.225 --> 06:58.291
Yes, thank you for
taking the time.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.827
Of course.

07:00.829 --> 07:03.930
I read your interview
yesterday.

07:03.932 --> 07:05.832
And my son was
in prison too.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.868
But unlike you,

07:08.870 --> 07:10.903
he didn't make it out.

07:12.407 --> 07:14.307
This says your son died
of a heart attack.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.809
-Yes, a heart attack out
of nowhere.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.277
You think they're
hiding something.

07:18.279 --> 07:19.512
Well, they won't
take my calls

07:19.514 --> 07:21.414
or answer my letters.

07:21.416 --> 07:23.149
What would you think?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.817
I'd think that there
might be something wrong.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.453
But that doesn't
mean that there is.

07:27.455 --> 07:29.989
Mr. Ross, my son
was 28 years old.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.425
And he was up for
parole next month.

07:32.427 --> 07:34.427
There's something
they're not telling me.

07:34.429 --> 07:36.362
All right,
I'll look into it.

07:36.364 --> 07:40.399
Um, but I'm not gonna be able
to get to this for a few days.

07:40.401 --> 07:42.902
A few days.
Why can't you start now?

07:42.904 --> 07:45.371
Because I have a deal
with my firm that allows me

07:45.373 --> 07:48.307
to do cases like this,
but not only cases like this.

07:48.309 --> 07:50.376
And right now, I'm in the middle
of something else.

07:50.378 --> 07:53.312
Mr. Ross, the last
lawyer I talked to

07:53.314 --> 07:55.448
said there was some kind
of a statute

07:55.450 --> 07:58.851
that says I only have another
two weeks to file a lawsuit.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.420
And I'm telling you, two weeks
should be more than enough time,

08:01.422 --> 08:05.491
but I--I can't drop everything
just to take your case.

08:05.493 --> 08:07.326
I understand.

08:07.328 --> 08:09.028
But...

08:09.030 --> 08:12.398
Chris was caught with
an ounce of marijuana.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.333
He never should have been there
in the first place.

08:14.335 --> 08:16.435
And if time runs out on this

08:16.437 --> 08:21.274
and I couldn't get him
justice...

08:21.276 --> 08:23.543
Okay.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.278
I'll see what I can do.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.983
Stephanie, we need to talk
about this assignment.

08:30.985 --> 08:32.552
Is there a problem with it?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.986
Yes, the problem is
you didn't do it.

08:34.989 --> 08:36.923
Jason did.

08:36.924 --> 08:40.592
Because Jason is better at
cataloging procedure than I am.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.461
Right, but if you don't do
the things you're not good at,

08:42.462 --> 08:44.063
you'll never get better.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.398
The thing is, I don't really
want to get better

08:45.400 --> 08:47.333
at cataloging procedure.

08:47.335 --> 08:49.335
I know that, just like
I didn't want to be a paralegal

08:49.337 --> 08:51.971
specializing in research for
as long as I was.

08:51.973 --> 08:54.607
But it turns out we
had a case last year

08:54.609 --> 08:57.944
that we only won because I was
outstanding at research.

08:59.881 --> 09:01.280
Okay, I see your point.

09:01.282 --> 09:03.516
I won't do it again.
Good.

09:03.518 --> 09:06.252
Because I have another case
that requires some procedure

09:06.254 --> 09:09.055
to be catalogued, and I put it
aside especially for you.

09:11.359 --> 09:12.959
But Stephanie, I want your word

09:12.961 --> 09:15.528
that you won't pawn
it off on Jason.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.330
You have my word.

09:20.969 --> 09:23.436
[phone buzzing]

09:25.874 --> 09:28.074
Well, look who it is.

09:28.076 --> 09:30.576
Don't tell me, you feel bad
about canceling the other night

09:30.578 --> 09:32.078
and now you're dying
to make it up to me.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.013
It's as though you read
my mind.

09:34.015 --> 09:36.015
<i>One of my many skills.</i>

09:36.017 --> 09:38.017
How does dinner tonight sound?

09:38.019 --> 09:40.353
How does having it
at my place sound?

09:40.355 --> 09:41.554
You're a crafty one,
aren't you?

09:41.556 --> 09:43.289
What? I've got some steaks

09:43.291 --> 09:44.957
I've been wanting to throw
on the grill.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.592
No, you want to have dinner
at your place

09:46.594 --> 09:47.894
'cause it's the closest
restaurant in the city

09:47.896 --> 09:49.428
to your bedroom.

09:49.430 --> 09:50.563
Did you read that
in "Zagat's"?

09:50.565 --> 09:52.331
No, I read your mind.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.900
Then what time am I thinking?

09:53.902 --> 09:55.568
How about 8:00?

09:55.570 --> 09:57.570
Better make it 8:30.
I got to go buy some steaks.

10:00.909 --> 10:02.541
Good, you're here.

10:02.543 --> 10:03.576
Tell me you figured out
what bullshit they're trying

10:03.578 --> 10:05.444
to sneak into this deal.

10:05.446 --> 10:06.913
They're not trying to sneak
anything into it.

10:06.915 --> 10:08.614
They're trying to
get out of it.

10:08.616 --> 10:10.683
That doesn't make sense.
They came to us for this merger.

10:10.685 --> 10:12.318
They must've gotten
a better offer,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.319
because they buried
an escape clause

10:13.321 --> 10:15.121
in the addendum.

10:15.123 --> 10:17.690
- You know what we have to do.
- Yes, I do.

10:17.692 --> 10:20.126
But you're gonna have
to do it without me.

10:20.128 --> 10:21.527
Something's come up,
it's on a deadline,

10:21.529 --> 10:23.162
and I need to take care of it.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.131
- What kind of thing?
- A pro Bono thing.

10:25.133 --> 10:27.667
Since when does one for me
mean two for you?

10:27.669 --> 10:30.603
Harvey, a man died in prison
and it doesn't smell right.

10:30.605 --> 10:32.505
Also, the only reason I found
out about it is

10:32.507 --> 10:34.106
I took your advice
and did that interview.

10:34.108 --> 10:35.942
So it's my fault
that you're dropping my case?

10:35.944 --> 10:37.643
Yeah, I like to look at it
that way.

10:37.645 --> 10:41.147
Seriously, go get 'em.

10:41.149 --> 10:42.448
Thanks, Harvey.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.353
The last guy brought me
a plant.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.988
Let me guess,
the last guy was Louis.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.656
- You got it.
- Well, I guarantee

10:50.658 --> 10:52.591
my welcome gift is a lot
more fun than his.

10:52.593 --> 10:54.493
Since when is a merger
signing fun?

10:54.495 --> 10:56.629
Since the guys on the other
side are trying to rip us off

10:56.631 --> 10:58.397
and think we don't know.

10:58.399 --> 10:59.966
Why didn't you tell me that in
the first place?

10:59.968 --> 11:01.600
Come on. I'll fill you in
on the way over.

11:01.602 --> 11:03.602
Wait, the meeting's now?

11:03.604 --> 11:04.971
Yeah, is that a problem?

11:04.973 --> 11:06.739
I told Louis we'd get lunch.

11:06.741 --> 11:08.641
Business trumps lunch.
Louis'll understand.

11:08.643 --> 11:10.242
Just call him
and let him know.

<i>About that, Louis.</i>
<i>I have to reschedule.</i>

11:20.688 --> 11:22.989

I hope you understand.

11:22.991 --> 11:24.390
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:27.193
Business comes first.
Thanks.

11:27.195 --> 11:29.275
We'll do it another time.
In fact, I'm free all week.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.466
Louis? You okay?

11:33.468 --> 11:35.001
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

11:35.003 --> 11:38.004
I, uh--
it's allergy season.

11:38.006 --> 11:40.539
I--I think it's probably best
that we don't have lunch today.

11:40.541 --> 11:43.609
I, uh--my--my chest
feels like a vice.

11:45.546 --> 11:46.679
All good?

11:46.681 --> 11:48.247
I think so.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.249
What kind of plant
did he get you, anyway?

11:50.251 --> 11:52.752
- Honeysuckle.
- Huh.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.153
I never knew that
was an indoor plant.

11:54.155 --> 11:55.688
Can be.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.490
Matter of fact, our cats
are gonna love it.

11:57.492 --> 12:00.559
- You have cats?
- Why you gotta be like that?

12:00.561 --> 12:02.661
- Why you gotta have cats?
- I like my cats.

12:02.663 --> 12:04.497
No, you don't.

12:04.499 --> 12:07.099
[laughing]

12:12.540 --> 12:15.541
Ms. Snyder? Mike Ross.

12:15.543 --> 12:17.510
Is that name supposed to mean
something to me?

12:17.512 --> 12:20.579
No, but I'm representing
the family of Chris Reyes.

12:22.216 --> 12:23.449
Hoping that name does.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.817
Of course.

12:24.819 --> 12:26.118
Any time an inmate dies,

12:26.120 --> 12:28.054
we take it very seriously.

12:28.056 --> 12:29.722
But not seriously enough to
give an accounting of his death

12:29.724 --> 12:32.158
despite repeated requests
by his family.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.193
I received no such requests.

12:34.195 --> 12:35.661
It's a shame you didn't
call first.

12:35.663 --> 12:37.196
I could've prepared
something.

12:37.198 --> 12:38.697
I didn't want you
to be prepared,

12:38.699 --> 12:40.566
'cause I want to know what
actually happened.

12:40.568 --> 12:42.601
Mr. Ross,
when you do what I do,

12:42.603 --> 12:44.570
you get used to people assuming
the worst about your company,

12:44.572 --> 12:46.105
so I would appreciate
a little respect.

12:46.107 --> 12:47.606
Ms. Snyder, when
you do what I do,

12:47.608 --> 12:49.141
you get used to companies
proving you right,

12:49.143 --> 12:52.645
so I would appreciate
a little action.

12:59.754 --> 13:02.555
Apparently Mr. Reyes
was in a fight.

13:02.557 --> 13:04.323
He was sent to solitary,
where he complained

13:04.325 --> 13:06.092
of difficulty breathing.

13:06.094 --> 13:08.127
A doctor was called
and delivered treatment.

13:08.129 --> 13:10.129
Unfortunately, he died
a few hours later.

13:10.131 --> 13:11.630
Well, if he was in a fight,

13:11.632 --> 13:13.532
there has to be
an incident report.

13:13.534 --> 13:15.534
That may be, but you have
no right to access it.

13:15.536 --> 13:17.169
We're a private corporation.
That's privileged.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.571
Okay, then how about
you give me

13:18.573 --> 13:20.172
the names of the guards
who saw it?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.874
You know I can't give you
that either.

13:21.876 --> 13:23.342
And you know that if I bring
a suit against you,

13:23.344 --> 13:25.144
I'm gonna get all
of this anyway.

13:25.146 --> 13:28.114
So why don't you save yourself
the publicity

13:28.116 --> 13:29.715
and just give it to me now?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.927
I don't care what that
thing says.

13:38.929 --> 13:41.029
It's not the whole story.

13:41.031 --> 13:43.265
Mr. Reyes, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

13:43.267 --> 13:44.966
but I'm not seeing a case.

13:44.968 --> 13:47.702
It says there that my son

13:47.704 --> 13:49.638
died alone in solitary
confinement.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.872
Why didn't they take him
to an infirmary?

13:50.874 --> 13:52.574
Because he was seen
by a doctor.

13:52.576 --> 13:53.909
There was an explanation
for his symptoms.

13:53.911 --> 13:55.810
I know you think
I'm just a man

13:55.812 --> 13:57.879
who can't accept
his child's death.

13:57.881 --> 13:59.814
But that's not true.

13:59.816 --> 14:02.083
Mr. Reyes, a fight in prison
can elevate your heart rate.

14:02.085 --> 14:03.752
Nobody knows that
better than I do.

14:03.754 --> 14:06.755
What they're saying happened
is plausible.

14:06.757 --> 14:08.590
Then you didn't know my son.

14:08.592 --> 14:11.259
I told you, he was up
for parole next month.

14:11.261 --> 14:13.328
He wouldn't have gotten
into a fight.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.330
What exactly are you saying?

14:15.332 --> 14:16.665
One of those inmates

14:16.667 --> 14:18.967
must have come for him.

14:18.969 --> 14:21.336
And that prison didn't give
enough of a shit about Chris

14:21.338 --> 14:23.772
to protect him.

14:23.774 --> 14:25.574
Mr. Reyes, I know that
you came to me

14:25.576 --> 14:27.008
because that article said
I wanted to help people

14:27.010 --> 14:29.611
and I do, but...

14:29.613 --> 14:32.113
I know.
My son's already dead.

14:32.115 --> 14:35.016
But if they could've
stopped this and they didn't,

14:35.018 --> 14:37.118
it's going to happen again.

25:20.065 --> 25:21.765
people are gonna get the message

25:21.767 --> 25:23.734
that we don't want to be
in the real estate business.

25:23.736 --> 25:25.135
Did they say they were gonna
give people that message?

25:25.137 --> 25:26.737
- Harvey--
- Did they or not?

25:26.739 --> 25:28.205
- They did.
- Drop 'em.

25:28.207 --> 25:29.406
- God damn it--
- I said drop 'em.

25:29.408 --> 25:30.741
- No.
- Excuse me?

25:30.743 --> 25:32.309
I may not be name partner yet,

25:32.311 --> 25:34.111
but you don't get to tell me
who my clients are.

25:34.113 --> 25:35.212
Yes, I do.

25:35.214 --> 25:37.414
Harvey, listen to yourself.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.382
It's one pro bono.
He just took it.

25:39.384 --> 25:41.084
He can drop it.

25:43.288 --> 25:44.988
I gave him my word.

25:44.990 --> 25:46.389
And you once gave
your word to me

25:46.391 --> 25:48.391
and went back on it
and I let it go.

25:48.393 --> 25:50.494
Because I understood
it was business.

25:50.496 --> 25:53.029
If this kid doesn't get that,
what the hell is he doing here?

26:00.239 --> 26:03.273
Stephanie, I asked you to come
to my office.

26:03.275 --> 26:04.541
That was over an hour ago.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.243
I was working on
the Sanderson brief.

26:06.245 --> 26:07.778
I was about to come down.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.446
Well, I need to talk
to you now,

26:09.448 --> 26:11.214
because you told me that
you wouldn't hand this off,

26:11.216 --> 26:13.083
and you did.

26:13.085 --> 26:14.518
No, I told you that I wouldn't
hand it off to Jason,

26:14.520 --> 26:16.386
and I didn't.

26:16.388 --> 26:17.420
I'm sorry, are you trying
to get out of this

26:17.422 --> 26:19.156
on a technicality?

26:19.158 --> 26:21.491
I'm your supervisor,
not opposing counsel.

26:21.493 --> 26:24.194
Rachel, I tried to be nice
about this,

26:24.196 --> 26:26.363
but I'm a fourth-year associate,

26:26.365 --> 26:27.998
and I'm not wasting my time

26:28.000 --> 26:29.533
on something a first-year
could handle.

26:29.535 --> 26:32.169
Now, if you don't mind, I would
like to get back to work.

26:33.338 --> 26:35.071
Actually, I do mind.

26:35.073 --> 26:37.574
Excuse me, Stephanie,
I'm speaking to you.

26:37.576 --> 26:40.110
It doesn't matter
what year you are.

26:40.112 --> 26:41.444
I'm head of the associates.

26:41.446 --> 26:43.380
If I give you an assignment,
you do it.

26:43.382 --> 26:45.515
And when you give me one
that's worth my time, I will.

26:45.517 --> 26:46.550
What's going on here?

26:46.552 --> 26:48.285
Donna, I'm handling it.

26:48.287 --> 26:50.020
What's going on is
that I am a grown woman,

26:50.022 --> 26:51.354
and I don't need to be
told what to do by someone

26:51.356 --> 26:53.557
with less experience
as a lawyer than me.

26:53.559 --> 26:55.425
Then you're really gonna
hate being told what to do

26:55.427 --> 26:57.460
by someone with no experience
as a lawyer.

26:57.462 --> 26:59.162
- Donna--
- Excuse me?

26:59.164 --> 27:00.597
I said, you're here,
and I'm here.

27:00.599 --> 27:02.399
So unless you want
to deal with me,

27:02.401 --> 27:04.868
you'll listen when Rachel
tells you something.

27:04.870 --> 27:08.138
I was recruited to come here.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.340
And I was told that
I would be valued

27:10.342 --> 27:12.142
for my mind, my billings,

27:12.144 --> 27:13.577
and my relationship
with my clients.

27:13.579 --> 27:15.312
And since I got here,

27:15.314 --> 27:17.314
I have had to take shit
from Louis.

27:17.316 --> 27:19.549
And now you're asking me
to waste my time and my ability

27:19.551 --> 27:21.184
on something like this.

27:21.186 --> 27:23.119
- Okay--
- You're right, Stephanie.

27:23.121 --> 27:24.454
You shouldn't have been
treated like that by Louis.

27:24.456 --> 27:26.156
And Rachel and I
took care of it.

27:26.158 --> 27:28.258
Now as for your
time and ability,

27:28.260 --> 27:30.460
if you don't do whatever
assignment Rachel gives you,

27:30.462 --> 27:32.429
I don't give a shit
how good you are.

27:32.431 --> 27:34.197
We are gonna show you the door.

saved your ass?

27:56.023 --> 27:59.357
It did, but that's
not why I'm here.

27:59.359 --> 28:00.992
Harvey, what's going on?

28:00.994 --> 28:03.461
You have to drop
your pro bono.

28:03.463 --> 28:04.929
There's a conflict with one
of our clients.

28:04.931 --> 28:06.031
What? Who?
I checked for conflicts

28:06.033 --> 28:07.932
before I took the case.

28:07.934 --> 28:09.000
- It's a new client.
- Well, if it's a new client,

28:09.002 --> 28:10.468
then let's drop them.

28:10.470 --> 28:11.936
We can't.
They're a huge developer.

28:11.938 --> 28:13.338

I'm suing a prison.

28:13.340 --> 28:14.706

but they're saying--

28:14.708 --> 28:16.474
I don't care what
they're saying.

28:16.476 --> 28:17.575
That's not a conflict.
That's a shakedown.

28:17.577 --> 28:18.977

and then you're gonna make me
dump them for no good reason?

28:23.350 --> 28:24.916
It's not no good reason.

28:24.918 --> 28:27.385
It's Alex's developer,
and I just brought him in.

28:27.387 --> 28:28.953
I let him lose one
of his biggest clients

28:28.955 --> 28:30.989
his first week here,
it's a disaster.

28:30.991 --> 28:32.691
And I let a man die
without getting him justice.

28:32.693 --> 28:34.559
What the hell is that?
Listen to me--

28:34.561 --> 28:36.428
Listen to yourself.
We had a deal.

28:36.430 --> 28:38.563
Now this clown is asking me
to drop a client

28:38.565 --> 28:40.398
that I made a promise to.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.367
Except he's not asking you
to drop him, Mike.

28:42.369 --> 28:46.071
I am. And if you don't,
that deal we made--it's over.

28:53.647 --> 28:55.046
How could you do that?

28:55.048 --> 28:57.015
Do what? I was helping you.

28:57.017 --> 28:59.651
No, Donna, you were
undermining me.

28:59.653 --> 29:01.386
Undermining you?

29:01.388 --> 29:03.054
You needed backup.
That's what I'm here for.

29:03.056 --> 29:05.023
No, I needed to handle
the situation,

29:05.025 --> 29:07.525
which is what I was doing
until you decided to interfere

29:07.527 --> 29:09.627
in something that you don't
know anything about.

29:09.629 --> 29:12.097
No offense, Rachel, but I did
know something about it,

29:12.099 --> 29:14.132
and from what I could tell,
you weren't handling it at all.

29:14.134 --> 29:16.067
And you think what you did
was any better?

29:16.069 --> 29:18.136
I think I told you that you
need to set the tone early on.

29:18.138 --> 29:20.071
Okay, and the tone
that you just set

29:20.073 --> 29:23.608
is that if you're not there,
she can walk all over me.

29:23.610 --> 29:24.709
Well, I don't know
what room you were in,

29:24.711 --> 29:26.544
but she was doing that anyway.

29:26.546 --> 29:28.012
And what does it say about me
if the other associates

29:28.014 --> 29:29.781
see me letting her do that?

29:29.783 --> 29:31.750
What it says is that you
trust my leadership style

29:31.752 --> 29:33.518
instead of thinking that you
need to fight my fights for me.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.086
Stephanie needed
what I gave her.

29:35.088 --> 29:37.389
And if you think that was
me fighting your fights,

29:37.391 --> 29:38.490
you don't know what
you're talking about.

29:38.492 --> 29:39.691
Because if it were up to me,

29:39.693 --> 29:40.759
I would've fired her
on the spot.

29:40.761 --> 29:42.160
Well then, why didn't you?

29:42.162 --> 29:43.628
Because they're not
my associates.

29:43.630 --> 29:44.996
You're right.
They're mine.

29:44.998 --> 29:46.131
And I fought for you
to get them.

29:46.133 --> 29:47.966
And you just belittled me

29:47.968 --> 29:50.402
and embarrassed me
in front of all of them.

29:50.404 --> 29:51.703
And that is not something that I

29:51.705 --> 29:53.805
thought my friend
would do to me.

29:53.807 --> 29:55.573
Well, you know what, I never
thought I would say this,

29:55.575 --> 29:57.575
but maybe you weren't
ready for your new position.

29:57.577 --> 29:59.043
Well, you know what, Donna?

29:59.045 --> 30:00.612
Maybe neither were you.

30:05.152 --> 30:07.719
Dr. Lipschitz, I, uh--
I know you're in a session.

30:07.721 --> 30:09.554
I just wanted to say
that you were right.

30:09.556 --> 30:11.689
Uh, I was overreacting.

30:11.691 --> 30:13.558
I do not have a problem
with Alex.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.660
And, uh, if I ever
get triggered again,

30:15.662 --> 30:17.662
I have the deep breathing.

30:17.664 --> 30:19.197

No, it doesn't matter
how long it takes, Louis.

30:28.475 --> 30:30.208

back to some client, right?

'Cause nobody around here
gives a shit about anything

30:32.179 --> 30:33.478
other than making money anyway.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.447
Mike, what is going on?

30:35.449 --> 30:37.115
What's going on is that
the only reason I came back here

30:37.117 --> 30:38.516
is that Harvey and I
made a deal,

30:38.518 --> 30:39.851
and it hasn't even
been a week,

30:39.853 --> 30:41.719
and he's already going
back on it.

30:41.721 --> 30:42.754
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not
gonna happen on my watch.

30:42.756 --> 30:44.456
Okay? So just slow down.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.138
Tell me what the hell
you're talking about.

30:50.864 --> 30:52.630
Harvey, we need to talk.

30:52.632 --> 30:54.165
Mike just told me you're
breaking a deal with him.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.667
Well, he shouldn't have
told you that,

30:55.669 --> 30:56.835
because that's none
of your business.

30:56.837 --> 30:58.536
None of my business?

30:58.538 --> 31:00.104
My name's on the wall
as much as yours.

31:00.106 --> 31:02.507
Look, if Mike
doesn't drop that case,

31:02.509 --> 31:03.775
we lose a major client.

31:03.777 --> 31:05.643
I can't have that.
- No, Harvey.

31:05.645 --> 31:07.545
What we can't have is
you setting a precedent

31:07.547 --> 31:10.615
that Alex's clients can run
roughshod all over us.

31:10.617 --> 31:11.616
Keep your voices down.

31:11.618 --> 31:13.518
Oh, I get it.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.086
So this isn't about me
breaking my deal with Mike.

31:15.088 --> 31:17.088
This is about you being
jealous of Alex.

31:17.090 --> 31:18.823
No, it isn't.
I thought it was a mistake

31:18.825 --> 31:20.692
even before I found out
that it was Alex's client.

31:20.694 --> 31:22.527
- Harvey, he has a point.
- Bullshit.

31:22.529 --> 31:24.262
You told me you were afraid
that I was gonna become

31:24.264 --> 31:26.865
better friends with him than
you, and that's what this is.

31:26.867 --> 31:29.667
How dare you say that to me in
front of Donna?

31:29.669 --> 31:33.705
I told you that in
complete confidence.

31:33.707 --> 31:36.207
This isn't about my
relationship with Alex.

31:36.209 --> 31:37.842
This is about your
relationship with Alex

31:37.844 --> 31:39.677
and how you're afraid
to stand up to him.

31:39.679 --> 31:41.679
You want to run that
by me again?

31:41.681 --> 31:43.214
I just ran it by you.

31:43.216 --> 31:45.216
What you are doing
is a mistake.

31:45.218 --> 31:46.718
I don't think so,

31:46.720 --> 31:48.586
and Donna doesn't think so,
which means--

31:48.588 --> 31:50.522
Actually, Harvey, I do.

31:50.524 --> 31:52.624
And if it's all the same to you,
I can speak for myself.

31:52.626 --> 31:55.660
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

31:55.662 --> 31:57.795
Because the last time you said
if I had something to say,

31:57.797 --> 31:59.230
say it in the goddamn meeting.

31:59.232 --> 32:01.199
Well, this is the goddamn
meeting.

32:01.201 --> 32:03.134
And I happen to think we should
keep our word to Mike

32:03.136 --> 32:04.736
instead of letting some client
bully us.

32:04.738 --> 32:06.738
Well, I appreciate the input.

32:06.740 --> 32:08.940
But I told you you'd
get a vote

32:08.942 --> 32:11.109
when I said there'd be a vote,

32:11.111 --> 32:12.710
and this isn't a vote.

32:12.712 --> 32:15.313
As for you, take a look
in the mirror,

32:15.315 --> 32:18.316
because the only reason
that you're pissed about this

32:18.318 --> 32:21.586
is your new honeysuckle friend
