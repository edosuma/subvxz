02:03.836 --> 02:06.538
"I'm fearless, and
therefore powerful."

02:06.540 --> 02:07.540
Mary Shelley.

02:09.608 --> 02:12.677
We see Betty vision not only
as an online dream board,

02:12.679 --> 02:15.046
but as an opportunity
to make people's dreams

02:15.048 --> 02:16.581
become a reality.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.751
And that seeing Betty vision
posts on one's newsfeed

02:19.753 --> 02:23.988
will be as common as selfies
and pictures of food.

02:28.562 --> 02:30.695
This better be an emergency
because I am 10 seconds away

02:30.697 --> 02:32.897
from a caffeine orgasm that
not even my thigh burner

02:32.899 --> 02:34.132
can fulfill.

02:34.134 --> 02:35.333
I think Marcus is gonna propose!

02:35.335 --> 02:36.334
What, why?

02:36.336 --> 02:37.402
What happened?

02:37.404 --> 02:38.770
After my presentation, he said,

02:38.772 --> 02:40.305
"oh by the way"...

02:40.307 --> 02:44.209
I made reservations
at julienne for Friday.

02:44.211 --> 02:45.577
It's our three year anniversary!

02:46.813 --> 02:48.246
Lucy, do you know
what this means?

02:48.248 --> 02:50.014
- What?
- Nothing.

02:50.016 --> 02:51.750
Absolutely nothing.

02:51.752 --> 02:52.951
I'm sorry.

02:52.953 --> 02:53.952
What are you gonna
do, you gonna say yes?

02:53.954 --> 02:55.920
Well, yeah, obviously.

02:55.922 --> 03:00.158
I mean, oh my god, we haven't
even talked about rings.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.494
I hope it's the ol' diamond.

03:02.496 --> 03:03.595
Hey, listen, just promise me
you don't get me one of those

03:03.597 --> 03:05.497
pink bridesmaids dresses.

03:05.499 --> 03:08.733
- Hanging up.
- Yup, love you, mean it!

03:11.805 --> 03:12.871
Oh, fuck!

03:13.773 --> 03:15.006
Yay!

03:15.008 --> 03:16.608
Oh my god, you're
getting married!

03:16.610 --> 03:17.776
Right?

03:17.778 --> 03:19.077
Oh yes, the signs are all there,

03:19.079 --> 03:20.345
he's totally gonna ask you.

03:20.347 --> 03:22.180
Darling, you're
ready for filming?

03:22.182 --> 03:23.281
Yeah, yeah, gimme one second.

03:23.283 --> 03:24.549
Did you pick a date yet?

03:24.551 --> 03:25.984
No, I thought I'd
get the ring first.

03:25.986 --> 03:27.485
Well have a few options in mind

03:27.487 --> 03:28.686
because that's gonna be the
first thing people ask you

03:28.688 --> 03:30.355
when you tell them
that you got engaged.

03:30.357 --> 03:32.991
Ooh, and make sure to get a
manicure before the dinner.

03:32.993 --> 03:34.759
Got it, manicure.
Check.

03:34.761 --> 03:36.060
Wait, why?

03:36.062 --> 03:38.496
The first picture post
of the ring, obviously.

03:38.498 --> 03:39.497
Okay.

03:39.499 --> 03:40.665
I gotta go, I gotta go to work.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.134
I'll call you after
class tonight.

03:51.110 --> 03:54.679
Let's work on some chords.

03:54.681 --> 03:56.915
All right, we'll start with

03:56.917 --> 03:57.982
g, c and b.

04:10.262 --> 04:11.963
What will it be?

04:11.965 --> 04:14.499
Oh, um, I'll have
a glass of the, uh,

04:14.501 --> 04:16.801
ambiance Pinot grigio, please.

04:16.803 --> 04:18.036
No, babe.

04:18.038 --> 04:20.103
Have the red, it's
better for you.

04:20.106 --> 04:24.309
- Oh, but I kinda feel like a...
- We'll have two brazin zins.

04:24.311 --> 04:25.376
Thank you.

04:42.394 --> 04:44.114
- I just wanted to...
- So, I was gonna have...

04:44.898 --> 04:46.731
- Go ahead.
- No, you go.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.800
Well I, I wanted to...

04:50.736 --> 04:52.804
I wanted to wait until
after dinner to do this.

04:52.806 --> 04:54.205
- Oh.
- Let's toast.

05:10.689 --> 05:14.225
You know Lucy, we have been
dating for three years.

05:14.227 --> 05:16.728
And we've known each
other for four years.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.029
And, well...

05:18.031 --> 05:19.097
Yes!

05:23.036 --> 05:26.604
It has been four years,
just confirming your math.

05:26.606 --> 05:28.106
Go on.

05:28.108 --> 05:29.407
We are not getting younger.

05:29.409 --> 05:30.875
No.

05:30.877 --> 05:32.944
And I feel that we're at
the point in our relationship

05:32.946 --> 05:35.013
where we have to move forward...

05:35.015 --> 05:36.080
Yes!

05:42.488 --> 05:43.721
Or break up.

05:45.492 --> 05:46.891
Here's your key.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.795
I would love mine back.

05:50.797 --> 05:51.863
Uh...

05:56.002 --> 05:57.068
Luce?

06:02.641 --> 06:04.809
That is a sipping wine...

06:06.045 --> 06:08.546
That's a $30 glass of wine...

06:19.358 --> 06:20.425
Well...

06:22.628 --> 06:26.097
Can I have a vodka
Martini and calamari?

06:32.605 --> 06:35.173
Can I get a, can I get a,
can I get a cheeseburger

06:35.175 --> 06:36.608
and pickles?

06:36.610 --> 06:39.577
And can I get a
fries and a shake?

06:39.579 --> 06:41.412
- Oh, yeah...
- Can I get a,

06:41.414 --> 06:43.881
and I want a big shake!

06:43.883 --> 06:45.583
Yeah, would you like that

06:45.585 --> 06:47.218
double sized, or...

07:01.667 --> 07:04.335
Do you want to go for a hike?

07:06.071 --> 07:07.705
What about a movie?

07:08.540 --> 07:09.641
Yeah.

07:09.643 --> 07:10.708
Yeah...

07:29.328 --> 07:30.328
Marcus.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.529
Despite Friday night's events,

07:31.531 --> 07:33.031
I think we can still
continue to have

07:33.033 --> 07:36.034
a productive work environment.

07:36.036 --> 07:39.537
Environment?
Oh, crap.

07:39.539 --> 07:41.072
"Productive work relationship."

07:41.074 --> 07:42.073
Aha.

07:42.075 --> 07:44.342
Productive work relationship.

07:44.344 --> 07:46.811
Productive work relationship.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.515
Didn't you get my email?

07:51.450 --> 07:52.850
What email?

07:52.852 --> 07:54.585
Lucy, I think it's best

07:54.587 --> 07:56.788
if we don't continue
working together.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.322
I'm gonna have to let you go.

07:58.324 --> 08:00.058
See human resources.

08:00.826 --> 08:02.093
Smiley face!

08:02.095 --> 08:03.161
Marcus.

08:06.499 --> 08:07.699
Really?

08:07.701 --> 08:09.967
Really, now you're gonna fire me?
Oh, real mature, buddy!

08:09.969 --> 08:11.969
I mean, who's gonna update
your status for you now, huh?

08:11.971 --> 08:13.171
You are so screwed!

08:13.173 --> 08:14.172
And who has all
the highlighters?

08:14.174 --> 08:15.239
My god...

08:31.758 --> 08:32.789
Ugh!

08:32.792 --> 08:33.857
God!

08:34.693 --> 08:35.827
Coming!

08:38.998 --> 08:40.465
Hold your horses!

08:42.835 --> 08:46.104
Ugh, I'm trying to sleep in...

08:46.106 --> 08:47.171
Ugh.

08:49.475 --> 08:51.075
Marcus email fired me.

08:51.077 --> 08:52.076
Coward!

08:52.078 --> 08:53.945
W-t-fuck?

08:53.947 --> 08:56.080
Why are you not crying?

08:56.082 --> 08:57.448
I'm too angry to cry.

08:57.450 --> 08:59.217
My teardrops have
turned into daggers

08:59.219 --> 09:00.518
and I want to throw them at him!

09:00.520 --> 09:02.353
Yay, I love this version of you!

09:02.355 --> 09:03.355
I got your text.

09:05.024 --> 09:06.557
Karen.

09:06.559 --> 09:09.594
He's giving my
campaign to Karen!

09:09.596 --> 09:11.395
How did I have no idea?

09:11.397 --> 09:12.463
Thank you.

09:13.866 --> 09:15.700
Dude, why are guys such dicks

09:15.702 --> 09:17.935
when they break up with us?

09:17.937 --> 09:20.071
Yeah, can't you
sue him for wrongful

09:20.073 --> 09:21.806
firing, or something?

09:21.808 --> 09:23.674
I signed a waiver when
we first started dating

09:23.676 --> 09:25.176
that would supersede
any lawsuit,

09:25.178 --> 09:27.378
which I was reminded of
during my exit interview

09:27.380 --> 09:29.080
with human resources.

09:29.082 --> 09:30.815
What about severance?

09:30.817 --> 09:32.316
Two weeks.

09:32.318 --> 09:34.585
But I'm a true
American, I've got debt.

09:34.587 --> 09:36.454
College, credit card,
my Louis Vuitton?

09:36.456 --> 09:38.589
My life is falling apart.

09:41.026 --> 09:44.061
Since when are you pen
pals with Denise Masterson?

09:44.063 --> 09:45.830
You don't know?

09:45.832 --> 09:46.831
Know what?

09:46.833 --> 09:48.599
She's getting married.

09:48.601 --> 09:50.067
We group texted about it.

09:50.069 --> 09:51.302
I've been ignoring
your group texts.

09:51.304 --> 09:52.537
I've been buried in my campaign.

09:52.539 --> 09:56.073
She is having an 80s
prom theme wedding,

09:57.342 --> 10:00.978
and the entire graduating
class is invited.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.980
Seriously?

10:03.816 --> 10:05.783
Denise Masterson is
inviting us to her wedding?

10:05.785 --> 10:07.051
Denise Masterson?

10:07.053 --> 10:08.553
Yes.

10:08.555 --> 10:09.854
Denise Masterson, as in
the person I strived to be

10:09.856 --> 10:11.322
from K through 12.

10:11.324 --> 10:12.623
Denise Masterson?

10:12.625 --> 10:13.825
Yes.

10:13.827 --> 10:15.226
Denise Masterson, as
in the coolest, nicest,

10:15.228 --> 10:17.295
prettiest girl in
the entire school!

10:17.297 --> 10:19.864
Denise Masterson, as in
the person you dressed up as

10:19.866 --> 10:21.732
for Halloween, senior year?

10:21.734 --> 10:22.800
So did you.

10:22.802 --> 10:24.202
- Ladies, ladies.
- Ooh.

10:24.204 --> 10:26.070
We don't need to fight over her.

10:26.072 --> 10:28.105
We just have to be
excited that we get to go

10:28.107 --> 10:29.841
the wedding of the decade.

10:29.843 --> 10:30.908
Yes!

10:31.677 --> 10:32.743
Wow.

10:34.179 --> 10:37.949
Maybe, maybe I should redirect
all of my emotional energy

10:37.951 --> 10:40.384
into the anticipation of
Denise Masterson's wedding,

10:40.386 --> 10:44.088
thus masking my true emotions
until months pass by,

10:44.090 --> 10:48.025
at which point, I am more
emotionally capable of dealing.

10:48.027 --> 10:49.293
Can you do that?

10:49.295 --> 10:50.561
Sure.

10:50.563 --> 10:51.863
I'll just put it
on a post-it note,

10:51.865 --> 10:53.764
for let's say um, I don't know, October?

10:53.766 --> 10:55.700
Hmm, yeah, that seems healthy.

10:55.702 --> 10:56.767
I'm not looking for healthy,

10:56.769 --> 10:58.336
I'm looking for survival.

10:58.338 --> 11:00.872
Whatever gets you
through it, I fully support.

11:00.874 --> 11:02.073
Thank you.

11:02.075 --> 11:03.774
Now, let's focus
all of our attention

11:03.776 --> 11:04.909
on Denise Masterson's wedding.

11:04.911 --> 11:05.910
Okay.

11:05.912 --> 11:07.478
So, Trista told me

11:08.747 --> 11:12.450
that they met on
a flight to Paris,

11:12.452 --> 11:13.918
and she...

11:13.920 --> 11:16.821
- hit on him.
- No!

11:16.823 --> 11:19.557
So, she started a conversation

11:20.626 --> 11:23.094
about the time they
hit the ground...

11:23.096 --> 11:25.096
- Mile high!
- Yeah.

11:25.098 --> 11:26.097
Wow.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.299
Oh, lavender, so classy.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.403
Mine's probably just waiting
in my mailbox right now.

11:32.405 --> 11:34.639
You didn't get it?

11:34.641 --> 11:36.474
I got mine last week.

11:36.476 --> 11:37.541
Me too.

11:39.378 --> 11:41.078
No.
No, no, no, I didn't get it.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.580
I didn't get it.

11:42.582 --> 11:43.981
I didn't, I didn't, I
didn't get an invitation,

11:43.983 --> 11:45.416
I didn't get an
invitation to her wedding!

11:45.418 --> 11:46.951
- No, no, no, no.
- That's okay, shh, shh.

11:46.953 --> 11:48.586
I thought you said she
invited the entire class?

11:48.588 --> 11:50.688
- No, no, I didn't...
- I don't have a boyfriend!

11:50.690 --> 11:51.822
I don't have a job!

11:51.824 --> 11:53.724
I can't get an
invitation to a wedding!

11:53.726 --> 11:57.828
And weddings, Fyi, are
where 50% of couples meet!

11:59.365 --> 12:02.199
It's never good when she
starts using statistics.

12:02.201 --> 12:04.201
If you're not going, we're not going.

12:04.203 --> 12:05.369
What?

12:05.371 --> 12:06.437
Yeah.

12:09.942 --> 12:14.011
Because apparently, Denise
is not the coolest, nicest...

12:14.013 --> 12:15.680
The funniest?

12:15.682 --> 12:19.016
The hippest, trendy,
most awesomest...

12:22.055 --> 12:23.888
Solidarity.

12:41.406 --> 12:42.907
Lucy...

12:42.909 --> 12:45.109
Put the self-help book down.

12:45.111 --> 12:46.210
I don't understand.

12:46.212 --> 12:48.479
I am doing everything right.

12:48.481 --> 12:51.682
I am chanting, and
meditating, and manifesting.

12:51.684 --> 12:54.018
I'm not being greedy
with my visualizations.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.086
Watch.

12:56.221 --> 12:58.856
I'm imagining myself
in a small cubicle,

12:58.858 --> 13:01.425
with carpal tunnel and
inter-office politics, and,

13:02.895 --> 13:05.363
I can even smell the Bo from
the guy in the room next to me.

13:05.365 --> 13:07.765
But nothing is working!

13:07.767 --> 13:08.767
Okay.

13:10.503 --> 13:12.436
You have gone to the dark side.

13:12.438 --> 13:15.439
I need you go to your happy place.

13:15.441 --> 13:17.008
Happy place, yeah.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.244
One times one is one.

13:20.246 --> 13:22.513
Two times two is four.

13:22.515 --> 13:24.682
Four times four is 16.

13:24.684 --> 13:26.350
It's not working!

13:26.352 --> 13:28.886
Oh my gosh, even my
fail safe has failed me!

13:28.888 --> 13:29.954
Look!

13:31.423 --> 13:35.259
I have applied for 43
jobs, but nobody is hiring.

13:35.261 --> 13:36.761
The obelisk group
isn't crossed out yet.

13:36.763 --> 13:39.663
That's just because they
haven't rejected me yet.

13:40.933 --> 13:41.999
I think you need to
get out of the house.

13:42.001 --> 13:43.000
Mmhmm.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.201
Oh, I can't leave.

13:44.203 --> 13:46.103
I have to clean,
the place is a mess.

13:48.975 --> 13:50.508
Looks pretty clean to me.

13:51.978 --> 13:53.544
You're kidding, right?

13:53.546 --> 13:55.279
- Execute plan B?
- Yup.

13:55.281 --> 13:56.480
What are you doing?

13:56.482 --> 13:57.481
We're helping you
rejoin humanity.

13:57.483 --> 13:58.949
You're gonna take a shower,

13:58.951 --> 14:00.317
and then we're gonna
take you to guitar class,

14:00.319 --> 14:01.552
and if you're really good...
don't touch les!

14:01.554 --> 14:03.187
Maybe you'll have a trip to staples!

14:03.189 --> 14:05.589
Ooh, highlighters!

14:05.591 --> 14:06.657
Ooh.

14:20.773 --> 14:22.640
- Oh my gosh, I am so sorry!
- Uh, no, I'm sorry.

14:22.642 --> 14:23.641
- My fault.
- I was not,

14:23.643 --> 14:24.875
I did...

14:26.045 --> 14:27.044
You know if this
was a car accident,

14:27.046 --> 14:29.880
the blame would be 50/50.

14:29.882 --> 14:30.882
I'm fully insured.

14:33.786 --> 14:35.853
Good to know.

14:37.089 --> 14:38.155
Um, okay.

14:39.825 --> 14:40.825
- Yup.
- Thank you.

14:40.827 --> 14:41.892
Okay, bye.

14:50.202 --> 14:51.402
Oh god.

14:51.404 --> 14:52.503
"I'm fully ensured"?

14:52.505 --> 14:53.838
Good one, Luce.

15:09.387 --> 15:11.027
You left this at the
scene of the crime.

15:13.226 --> 15:14.525
Thank you.

15:14.527 --> 15:15.759
You're welcome.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.061
For the record,
I know those too.

15:17.063 --> 15:18.395
Old school that way.

15:18.397 --> 15:20.498
Are you joining the class?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.067
Yes.
Graham, guitar teacher.

15:23.069 --> 15:25.202
Lucy, marketing.

15:25.204 --> 15:28.272
Nice to meet you,
Lucy, marketing.

15:30.442 --> 15:32.209
Okay guys, my name is Graham.

15:32.211 --> 15:34.879
I'm subbing for Marta for
the next couple of weeks.

15:34.881 --> 15:36.280
If you're not a rock
star in this class,

15:36.282 --> 15:37.581
I will give your money back.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.416
Everyone take a page.

15:39.418 --> 15:41.986
Okay, those are chord sheets.

15:41.988 --> 15:43.220
Right.

15:43.222 --> 15:44.688
We'll get straight
into it, all right?

15:44.690 --> 15:46.757
We're gonna play a song
called "Uncomfortable Shoes"

15:46.759 --> 15:49.493
by a good buddy of mine
called Elion Olson.

15:49.495 --> 15:53.330
Right, everyone get
your, get a G goin' on.

15:53.332 --> 15:54.398
You got a G down there?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.867
Yeah?
Okay.

15:56.869 --> 15:58.068
G.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.570
We're gonna go to a C.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.108
So this is a real, real
nice beat, all right?

16:09.814 --> 16:11.649
Just like that.
I'm gonna count you guys in.

16:11.651 --> 16:13.951
Everybody set?
All right?

16:13.953 --> 16:15.920
One, two, three, and...

16:23.295 --> 16:24.461
Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:24.463 --> 16:25.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?

16:25.932 --> 16:27.164
We sucked.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.999
No, you didn't
suck, you just uh,

16:29.001 --> 16:31.235
it's all music, you just
made a different version.

16:31.237 --> 16:34.338
Tell you what.
Who's got a pick?

16:34.340 --> 16:35.839
Go ahead, put it in your mouth.

16:35.841 --> 16:38.409
All right, that's the way
I like to play, right?

16:38.411 --> 16:40.711
Just 'cause it looks cool,
it makes you feel cooler.

16:40.713 --> 16:42.613
All right?
I'm like a real rockstar.

16:42.615 --> 16:44.081
I'm gonna do it again.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.283
All right?
Everyone ready?

16:46.285 --> 16:47.685
One, two, three.

18:01.293 --> 18:02.426
"The journey of 1,000 miles"

18:02.428 --> 18:04.795
"must begin with a single step."

18:04.797 --> 18:05.863
Confucius.

18:35.827 --> 18:37.061
This is Lucy.

18:37.063 --> 18:38.696
Hi, Lucy, it's Denise Masterson

18:38.698 --> 18:39.930
from precious heart.

18:39.932 --> 18:41.598
<i>I got your number off Facebook?</i>

18:41.600 --> 18:42.833
Uh huh.

18:42.835 --> 18:43.967
<i>One week until the big day.</i>

18:43.969 --> 18:44.969
<i>Crazy!</i>

18:46.105 --> 18:47.271
<i>I'm going to nuts with
last minute details.</i>

18:47.273 --> 18:49.740
<i>Seven people haven't rsvp'd.</i>

18:49.742 --> 18:52.076
<i>So, are you coming?</i>

18:52.078 --> 18:53.077
I, I didn't...

18:53.079 --> 18:54.078
<i>Oh, shoot.</i>

18:54.080 --> 18:55.813
That's the caterer,
hang on a sec?

19:11.663 --> 19:12.730
<i>Lucy?</i>

19:14.532 --> 19:16.266
- <i>Lucy, you there?</i>
- I'm coming!

19:16.268 --> 19:17.768
I'm totally coming!

19:17.770 --> 19:19.636
That's like, so weird that
you didn't get my RSVP.

19:19.638 --> 19:20.704
Stupid snail mail.

19:20.706 --> 19:22.373
One stamp wasted!

19:22.375 --> 19:23.574
<i>Yay!</i>

19:23.576 --> 19:24.942
<i>Three down, four
more people to call.</i>

19:24.944 --> 19:28.078
Oh, well, let me
save you a few calls.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.316
Ryann Becker and Nectar McAllister
are definitely coming.

19:34.086 --> 19:35.819
Uh, I mean, if
they're on your list,

19:35.821 --> 19:38.021
not that they would
be, but if they are...

19:38.023 --> 19:39.623
<i>Actually, yes, they are.</i>

19:39.625 --> 19:40.891
Yes!

19:40.893 --> 19:41.959
Oh cool, you
just saved me some time.

19:41.961 --> 19:42.960
<i>Oh we're really pumped.</i>

19:42.962 --> 19:44.495
We've already got our dresses.

19:44.497 --> 19:46.930
We're getting manis, pedis,
renting a limo, yadda yadda.

19:46.932 --> 19:48.432
<i>Love me some 80s!</i>

19:48.434 --> 19:51.969
My cousin Amanda
had her baby six weeks early.

19:51.971 --> 19:52.970
Oh, no!

19:52.972 --> 19:54.238
Ugh, the baby's fine.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.373
But now, 11 family
members from Ohio

19:56.375 --> 19:57.441
<i>are not coming down.</i>

19:57.443 --> 19:58.609
<i>I've got seats to fill.</i>

19:58.611 --> 19:59.910
<i>I'm probably the
first bride in history</i>

19:59.912 --> 20:01.945
<i>trying to recruit
wedding guests.</i>

20:01.947 --> 20:03.647
Please, tell me that
you're bringing plus ones?

20:03.649 --> 20:05.916
Plus ones?
Yeah!

20:05.918 --> 20:07.151
Definitely, we're definitely
bringing plus ones.

20:07.153 --> 20:08.619
<i>I'm being a complete bridezilla.</i>

20:08.621 --> 20:10.954
<i>It's just, I hate those tacky
weddings with empty seats.</i>

20:10.956 --> 20:12.156
Right.

20:12.158 --> 20:13.390
<i>Ah, that's the caterer again.</i>

20:13.392 --> 20:15.292
<i>I can't wait to
meet your hot men.</i>

20:15.294 --> 20:16.460
<i>See you Friday!</i>

20:16.462 --> 20:17.528
Friday.

20:19.063 --> 20:20.297
Wait, hot men?

20:21.766 --> 20:22.833
Oh, crap.

20:26.371 --> 20:28.972
So uh, Denise Masterson
called me today.

20:28.974 --> 20:30.174
Turns out we're invited.

20:30.176 --> 20:31.308
Who knew?

20:31.310 --> 20:32.776
Not me.

20:32.778 --> 20:33.844
So, yay!

20:34.512 --> 20:35.846
I get to go to the ball!

20:35.848 --> 20:37.248
Oh, I feel like
cinde-fuckin'-rella!

20:38.918 --> 20:40.684
What the fuck was that?
We need dresses!

20:40.686 --> 20:42.352
Crapola.

20:42.354 --> 20:43.787
I am completely tapped.

20:43.789 --> 20:45.622
Don't worry, I'm too
excited, I will cover for you!

20:45.624 --> 20:48.625
So I am thinking
sequins all the way.

20:48.627 --> 20:51.228
Dynasty, sequins, lots
and lots of sequins.

20:51.230 --> 20:52.763
Mmm.

20:52.765 --> 20:55.005
So I might have told Denise
we were bringing plus ones.

20:56.669 --> 20:57.968
Wait, what?

20:57.970 --> 20:59.002
I became possessed by
the wedding invitation.

20:59.004 --> 21:00.337
The lavender went to my head.

21:00.339 --> 21:02.272
Her cousin just had a baby!

21:02.274 --> 21:03.740
Hello?

21:03.742 --> 21:07.010
And she is a bridezilla
with a fear of open spaces.

21:07.012 --> 21:08.245
Okay.

21:08.247 --> 21:09.980
A, I have no idea
what you just said.

21:09.982 --> 21:12.082
And B, I don't want
to bring a plus one,

21:12.084 --> 21:13.550
I want to meet a plus one.

21:13.552 --> 21:15.452
Think of all her fiance's hot
friends we could meet there.

21:15.454 --> 21:16.920
Okay.

21:16.922 --> 21:18.422
This is such an easy solution.

21:18.424 --> 21:20.224
You can bring that model from
your Gucci shoot last month.

21:20.226 --> 21:21.625
Ew, he waxes hit armpit.

21:21.627 --> 21:22.626
That is disgusting.

21:22.628 --> 21:23.894
And you can bring that guy

21:23.896 --> 21:26.129
that your mom tried
to set you up with.

21:26.131 --> 21:27.231
Are you out of your mind?

21:27.233 --> 21:28.699
- Mm-mmm.
- Nolan?

21:28.701 --> 21:30.534
First of all, I don't think
he has time to fit me in

21:30.536 --> 21:32.603
between his geek
fair and ren fest.

21:32.605 --> 21:35.472
And second of all, I am
not gonna bring a Trekkie

21:35.474 --> 21:38.475
who still wears headgear to
Denise Masterson's wedding!

21:38.477 --> 21:39.543
D...

21:44.950 --> 21:46.416
I don't know what to tell you.

21:46.418 --> 21:49.987
I was trying to be a yes
person, and it just came out.

21:49.989 --> 21:51.421
We should not be
trying to get lame dates

21:51.423 --> 21:52.556
for a wedding.

21:52.558 --> 21:54.658
Yes.
Finally, sanity.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.561
We should be trying
to find dream dates.

21:57.563 --> 21:58.829
What?

21:58.831 --> 22:00.097
We keep saying yes
to the wrong guys.

22:00.099 --> 22:03.100
We need to go out there,
take some control back,

22:03.102 --> 22:05.602
start getting what
we want for a change.

22:05.604 --> 22:08.038
If Denise Masterson
can hit on a guy

22:08.040 --> 22:09.339
on a plane to Paris,

22:09.341 --> 22:11.775
what is stopping us
from doing the same?

22:11.777 --> 22:12.776
Air fare.

22:12.778 --> 22:13.877
It's Monday.

22:13.879 --> 22:15.178
Right?

22:15.180 --> 22:16.680
Yes.

22:16.682 --> 22:18.982
That means we have until
Friday to go out there,

22:18.984 --> 22:22.619
get our crushes, and
bring 'em to the wedding.

22:22.621 --> 22:24.821
Okay, we can't just hit on guys.

22:24.823 --> 22:26.223
They're turned off by that.

22:26.225 --> 22:27.958
Unless of course,
you're a model,

22:27.960 --> 22:30.327
with come-do-me
eyes, which I am not.

22:30.329 --> 22:31.428
That part's true.

22:31.430 --> 22:33.130
You definitely have more of the

22:33.132 --> 22:35.699
ome-reorganize-my-closet-with-me
eyes.

22:35.701 --> 22:37.000
Ryann...

22:37.002 --> 22:38.035
We're gonna do this.

22:38.037 --> 22:39.703
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:39.705 --> 22:41.104
Well come on,
it'll be so much fun!

22:41.106 --> 22:42.172
- Do it?
- Yes!

22:43.074 --> 22:44.875
- Ryann?
- Fuck it, fine, I'll play.

22:44.877 --> 22:46.276
Yay!

22:46.278 --> 22:48.779
Ooh, I get Chris the
bartender from Edendale, baby.

22:48.781 --> 22:49.813
Josh Hartnett!

22:49.815 --> 22:51.081
Josh Hartnett?

22:51.083 --> 22:52.316
Dude, are you being
serious right now?

22:52.318 --> 22:53.984
Very, he just
bought the penthouse

22:53.986 --> 22:55.886
in the Mayan sisters
condo downtown.

22:55.888 --> 22:58.221
He's such a gentleman that when
I ran into him in the hall,

22:58.223 --> 23:00.424
and the gum fell out
of my gaping mouth,

23:00.426 --> 23:02.492
he handed it back to me.

23:04.362 --> 23:05.862
Um...

23:05.864 --> 23:07.264
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

23:07.266 --> 23:09.333
I don't really do
humiliation and rejection.

23:09.335 --> 23:11.835
And even if I wanted
to play, I can't.

23:11.837 --> 23:13.103
I don't have a crush.

23:13.105 --> 23:14.104
Bull-Scheissen.

23:14.106 --> 23:15.772
Guitar teacher.

23:15.774 --> 23:17.574
Graham?
Oh, God no.

23:17.576 --> 23:19.643
No, no, no, no.
He's so hot and normal.

23:19.645 --> 23:21.578
Seriously, pick some
random dorky guy.

23:21.580 --> 23:24.014
I would much rather
humiliate myself anonymously.

23:24.016 --> 23:25.415
Okay, guitar teacher it is.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.184
- Yup!
- Mmhmm.

23:27.186 --> 23:29.086
All right, when's your next class?

23:29.088 --> 23:30.754
- Tomorrow.
- Perfect.

23:30.756 --> 23:32.956
- It's also my last.
- Great!

23:32.958 --> 23:34.691
You can humiliate
yourself and run.

23:34.693 --> 23:38.261
What I'm proposing is
we embark on a pilgrimage

23:38.263 --> 23:42.499
to free fearful women
all over the atmosphere.

23:43.835 --> 23:45.135
Our decision to take back
control is bigger than we are.

23:45.137 --> 23:49.006
We are forging ahead
and paving the road,

23:49.008 --> 23:50.974
to free the...

23:50.976 --> 23:53.343
Shackles of the
restrictions of dating rules

23:53.345 --> 23:55.545
from the wrists of single
women all over the world.

23:55.547 --> 23:56.880
The miss America pageant called.

23:56.882 --> 23:59.282
They want their speech back.

24:00.652 --> 24:02.919
Do you really want to
waste another three years

24:02.921 --> 24:04.855
with the wrong guy?

24:04.857 --> 24:06.023
No.

24:06.025 --> 24:08.592
So who's in control, you or him?

24:09.894 --> 24:10.961
Me?

24:12.964 --> 24:16.333
Who's the one who
dumped you, hmm?

24:16.335 --> 24:17.734
Who's the one...

24:19.070 --> 24:20.303
Who fired you?

24:21.673 --> 24:24.374
And if you ever want to
drink a Pinot Grigio again,

24:24.376 --> 24:25.709
you'll take your control back.

24:25.711 --> 24:27.244
You're right.

24:27.246 --> 24:28.612
It's my life.

24:28.614 --> 24:29.846
I'm in charge.

24:30.948 --> 24:34.751
Besides, how hard can it
be to hit on some guy?

24:34.753 --> 24:36.019
Yay.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.989
That means our four-day
mission starts tomorrow.

24:40.059 --> 24:41.059
Game on!

24:57.342 --> 24:58.575
Welcome to the class.

24:58.577 --> 25:00.210
I'm sorry, I...

25:02.114 --> 25:03.780
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

25:03.782 --> 25:04.782
I'm sorry.

25:07.086 --> 25:09.619
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah I am.

25:09.621 --> 25:11.388
Meg, you gonna live?

25:11.390 --> 25:12.456
Probably.

25:13.357 --> 25:15.158
All set, deep breaths, okay.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.327
Let's get serious,
let's get practicing.

25:20.599 --> 25:23.233
Meg, you gonna keep practicing?

25:24.402 --> 25:25.635
Okay, I definitely will.

25:25.637 --> 25:28.772
And I'm super, super
interested in um,

25:29.640 --> 25:31.041
maybe taking your next course?

25:31.043 --> 25:32.275
Okay, well read the notices
on the bulletin board,

25:32.277 --> 25:33.877
and you'll know
what I'm doing when.

25:33.879 --> 25:37.414
Please, shoot me
a text, let me know.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.182
- Hey!
- Hey.

25:39.184 --> 25:40.884
Sorry about uh, my entrance.

25:42.254 --> 25:43.320
It's cool.

25:44.422 --> 25:47.557
Um, can I talk to
you for a second?

25:47.559 --> 25:49.626
- Yeah, sure.
- Over here?

25:49.628 --> 25:50.694
Yeah.
What's up?

25:55.166 --> 25:57.467
So listen, I've got this, um,

25:57.469 --> 25:59.369
this wedding to go to on Friday.

25:59.371 --> 26:00.871
It's not your wedding, I hope?

26:00.873 --> 26:02.739
No, no, not my wedding,
a friend's wedding.

26:02.741 --> 26:05.575
Uh, and I was
wondering, if um...

26:10.047 --> 26:13.583
If you think I would be able
to play a song at said wedding.

26:13.585 --> 26:15.652
Graham?
I broke a string.

26:15.654 --> 26:17.654
Okay, be right there.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.589
You know, I think, the truth is,

26:19.591 --> 26:21.191
you're capable of
anything you wanna do.

26:21.193 --> 26:22.859
You got four days.
Practice.

26:22.861 --> 26:25.162
- Surprise yourself.
- Yeah.

26:25.164 --> 26:27.197
I think it's a C string.

26:27.199 --> 26:29.065
There is no C string.

26:29.067 --> 26:30.267
I gotta go fix that.

26:30.269 --> 26:33.103
Just stay here,
hold on, all right?

26:33.105 --> 26:34.771
All righty.

26:34.773 --> 26:36.273
I, I see that.

26:36.275 --> 26:39.075
Just let me take this off
you, and I'll fix that.

26:47.785 --> 26:50.086
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:50.088 --> 26:52.522
- How'd it go?
- Oh, it didn't go.

26:52.524 --> 26:54.591
I opened my mouth, and
the wrong words came out.

26:54.593 --> 26:55.725
No!

26:55.727 --> 26:57.227
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:57.229 --> 26:58.495
It's okay.

26:58.497 --> 26:59.930
Positive thinking,
onward and upward.

26:59.932 --> 27:01.832
Got my interview tomorrow
with Girard manners.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.934
I'm just gonna focus all
my attention on that.

27:03.936 --> 27:05.068
You're totally gonna get it.

27:05.070 --> 27:07.137
- Thank you.
- And in case you don't,

27:07.139 --> 27:08.305
I've already spoken
to Roy and he said

27:08.307 --> 27:09.787
he would put you
back on his schedule.

27:10.909 --> 27:13.410
Thanks, but waiting tables
is pretty much my last resort.

27:14.413 --> 27:16.780
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

27:16.782 --> 27:17.781
You guys still good?

27:17.783 --> 27:19.316
Game time.

27:19.318 --> 27:20.517
Are you nervous?

27:20.519 --> 27:21.685
Please, piece of cake.

27:21.687 --> 27:22.752
Be cool.

27:22.754 --> 27:23.887
Yeah.

27:23.889 --> 27:25.488
- Have a mantra.
- Ooh, "have a mantra."

27:26.491 --> 27:28.458
Okay, um, I am cool.

27:28.460 --> 27:29.593
I am so cool.

27:30.494 --> 27:32.495
Oh, she's in trouble.

27:32.497 --> 27:33.830
Hey!

27:33.832 --> 27:35.098
Lucy, good to see you.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.500
- Hey, Ed.
- What's the haps, neighbor?

27:37.502 --> 27:38.702
I just finished a killer
set down at the comedy store

27:38.704 --> 27:39.836
with the boys.

27:39.838 --> 27:40.871
Thanks for showing up.

27:40.873 --> 27:41.872
You're welcome.

27:41.874 --> 27:42.939
- You didn't.
- I know.

27:42.941 --> 27:43.974
- That's awkward.
- Yup.

27:43.976 --> 27:46.443
I was sexy, per usual.

27:46.445 --> 27:47.978
But enough about me.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.312
How do you feel about going
halfers on a cleaning lady?

27:49.314 --> 27:50.413
Excuse me?

27:50.415 --> 27:51.615
Well the first week,

27:51.617 --> 27:53.116
she would clean my
bathroom and kitchen,

27:53.118 --> 27:54.951
and your living
room and bedroom,

27:54.953 --> 27:56.086
then next week, we'd swap.

27:56.088 --> 27:57.153
It's genius.

27:58.522 --> 28:01.291
Hey, Ed, hurry up,
your beer's getting cold.

28:01.293 --> 28:04.861
Sorry, sweet lady, alcohol
sings her siren song to me.

28:04.863 --> 28:06.463
You know what I'm talking about.

28:06.465 --> 28:08.431
- No, I don't.
- I gotta bolt, but uh,

28:08.433 --> 28:10.367
give some thought to
that cleaning lady offer.

28:10.369 --> 28:12.736
- Okay.
- It'd only be half price.

28:12.738 --> 28:14.938
Hey.
What's wrong with Ed?

28:16.675 --> 28:18.575
That.
That's when he gets drunk.

28:18.577 --> 28:19.577
Ed!

28:21.046 --> 28:22.612
Oh.

28:22.614 --> 28:24.614
I am so cool.

28:24.616 --> 28:26.449
I am so cool.
You are cool.

28:26.451 --> 28:30.320
I am cool.
I am cool.

28:30.322 --> 28:31.922
Well, if it isn't
my favorite customer

28:31.924 --> 28:33.256
out on a school night.

28:33.258 --> 28:34.824
Hey!

28:34.826 --> 28:36.059
What up, dawg?

28:37.161 --> 28:38.695
Just slinging drinks,
working for my living.

28:38.697 --> 28:39.863
How 'bout you?

28:39.865 --> 28:41.698
You know, just
hangin' with my pussy.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.668
My posse, my posse,
I said my posse.

28:44.670 --> 28:46.202
You and the uh,
homegirls just out

28:46.204 --> 28:47.404
for a night on the town, yeah?

28:47.406 --> 28:50.140
You know, yeah, for reals, yo.

28:51.275 --> 28:52.375
What'll it be?

28:52.377 --> 28:54.611
Three tequilas.

28:54.613 --> 28:56.179
Okay.

28:56.181 --> 28:57.580
Coming right up.

29:00.151 --> 29:02.552
A woman after my own heart.

29:02.554 --> 29:03.553
Uno.

29:03.555 --> 29:04.921
Dos.

29:04.923 --> 29:05.989
Tres.

29:12.096 --> 29:13.496
All right.

29:13.498 --> 29:15.932
Those are on me, I got 'em.

29:15.934 --> 29:17.834
Word!

29:17.836 --> 29:18.969
Yo, pound it.

29:19.737 --> 29:20.937
Yo.

29:20.939 --> 29:22.172
Very chill, dawg.

29:22.174 --> 29:24.240
Be careful with those.

29:26.812 --> 29:27.877
Tequila?

29:27.879 --> 29:28.945
Uh huh.

29:28.947 --> 29:30.080
Did you ask him out?

29:30.082 --> 29:32.082
No, it's kinda fuzzy.

29:32.084 --> 29:33.149
Well, walk us through it.

29:33.151 --> 29:34.217
I uh...

29:35.152 --> 29:36.853
Oh god, I think I turned
gangster or something.

29:36.855 --> 29:38.321
He probably thinks
I'm on medication.

29:38.323 --> 29:39.422
So you didn't ask him out?

29:39.424 --> 29:41.057
I don't think so.

29:41.059 --> 29:41.891
Then go back.

29:41.893 --> 29:43.159
No, I can't go back!

29:43.161 --> 29:44.160
When he gave me the
drinks for free,

29:44.162 --> 29:45.161
instead of saying thank you,

29:45.163 --> 29:46.429
I said, word!

29:47.466 --> 29:49.666
Never, ever, do that again.

29:49.668 --> 29:50.867
I know.

29:50.869 --> 29:52.402
I mean, it's a lot
harder than it looks.

29:52.404 --> 29:54.504
But free drinks though,
that's always a good sign.

29:54.506 --> 29:55.739
Yeah.

29:55.741 --> 29:57.374
Now go back and get me
a free Pinot Grigio.

29:57.376 --> 29:59.109
- I, mmm, shh!
- Oh.

29:59.111 --> 30:00.777
- Those are for me.
- All of them?

30:00.779 --> 30:02.012
Yes.

30:02.014 --> 30:03.213
I mean, I'm gonna go
back and talk to him,

30:03.215 --> 30:04.914
and I need some liquid
courage, don't I?

30:04.916 --> 30:06.249
You go get him, girl.

30:07.619 --> 30:08.685
Whoo!

30:10.121 --> 30:11.187
Ugh!

30:12.857 --> 30:14.557
Whoo!
Ugh!

30:14.559 --> 30:16.393
- Whoo.
- Are you okay?

30:17.396 --> 30:18.595
I was born ready.

30:18.597 --> 30:19.462
I know, but I asked
if you were okay.

30:19.464 --> 30:20.530
Yeah.

30:21.132 --> 30:22.432
Whoo.

30:24.436 --> 30:25.502
Ooh, dear.

30:27.204 --> 30:30.540
Whoa, back for more
already, rap star?

30:32.044 --> 30:33.510
Oh, no.

30:33.512 --> 30:34.511
Oh, no.

30:34.513 --> 30:35.612
Let me get you some water.

30:35.614 --> 30:38.982
- We're bad friends.
- Uh huh.

30:38.984 --> 30:41.051
All right, time to go.

30:44.922 --> 30:46.356
Nice...

31:16.020 --> 31:17.087
Ugh...

31:45.816 --> 31:46.883
Ugh...

31:48.152 --> 31:49.219
Tequila...

31:49.820 --> 31:51.521
Is not my friend.

31:51.523 --> 31:53.723
Tequila is nobody's
friend, my friend.

31:53.725 --> 31:55.992
I'm calling to let
you make me feel better.

31:55.994 --> 31:57.293
Please, tell me that
I wasn't that bad

31:57.295 --> 31:58.628
and that with ample counseling,

31:58.630 --> 32:00.630
I still may able to
lead a productive life.

32:00.632 --> 32:01.731
It wasn't that bad.

32:01.733 --> 32:02.999
And with ample counseling,

32:03.001 --> 32:04.667
you can still lead
a productive life.

32:04.669 --> 32:06.069
Oh, thank God.

32:06.904 --> 32:07.971
So...

32:08.739 --> 32:10.073
When will Roy be in?

32:10.075 --> 32:11.908
Three o'clock.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.943
Take it that interview
didn't go very well?

32:13.945 --> 32:16.346
Position's been
filled internally.

32:17.916 --> 32:18.982
Hold on...

32:27.892 --> 32:29.859
Shaking hands.

32:29.861 --> 32:31.494
Well, it's official.

32:31.496 --> 32:32.496
I'm employed.

32:33.498 --> 32:35.598
Welcome to the last resort.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.400
We hope you enjoy
your stay here.

32:37.402 --> 32:38.400
Thanks.

32:38.402 --> 32:40.537
There are many activities to partake
in when you're at the last resort,

32:40.539 --> 32:42.739
like candle lighting, for one.

32:42.741 --> 32:45.041
I will be partaking in
activity number two!

32:46.044 --> 32:47.810
Sleeping.
Lucy?

32:47.812 --> 32:49.445
You have some explaining to do.

32:49.447 --> 32:50.947
Hola, Hugo.

32:50.949 --> 32:53.583
For fucks sake,
will you keep it down?

32:53.585 --> 32:55.084
Now tell me, when you
start back here, eh?

32:55.086 --> 32:56.352
Tonight.

32:56.354 --> 32:57.620
I just need to go
get a wine key,

32:57.622 --> 32:58.454
and then Roy's gonna put
me back on the floor.

32:58.456 --> 32:59.756
No, no, no, no, no.

32:59.758 --> 33:01.024
Don't worry, I have an
extra one in the back.

33:01.026 --> 33:02.659
But, you must promise
it to return it, okay?

33:02.661 --> 33:03.726
Because it's top of the line.

33:03.728 --> 33:04.961
Now come, come, come, look.

33:04.963 --> 33:06.643
We fold napkins, and
you finish this, okay?

33:09.868 --> 33:10.934
Go away...

33:11.936 --> 33:13.436
Listen to what Hugo thinks.

33:13.438 --> 33:16.172
You need to stop playing these
silly little games, okay?

33:16.174 --> 33:18.741
Because the females are not
meant to hit on the males.

33:18.743 --> 33:19.943
You are so sexist.

33:19.945 --> 33:21.377
Yes.

33:21.379 --> 33:23.746
That is what your
society agreed upon.

33:23.748 --> 33:25.181
And you have to do this because
you are going to confuse

33:25.183 --> 33:26.249
the mass.

33:27.051 --> 33:28.017
The masses.

33:28.019 --> 33:29.085
Whatever.

33:30.287 --> 33:31.621
I wouldn't even have to play

33:31.623 --> 33:33.656
if I hadn't rsvp'd
for all of us.

33:33.658 --> 33:35.091
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:35.093 --> 33:36.392
That's Eggo.

33:36.394 --> 33:37.260
That's what?

33:37.262 --> 33:38.528
Eggo.

33:38.530 --> 33:40.964
American women
have too much Eggo.

33:40.966 --> 33:41.798
Okay, listen.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.899
In my country...

33:46.605 --> 33:48.705
You know I don't
speak Spanish, right?

33:48.707 --> 33:50.406
No, I had no idea.

33:53.645 --> 33:55.178
Tonight, we have the Halibut,

33:55.180 --> 33:57.680
with the garlic crumb crust
and lemon butter for $39.95...

33:57.682 --> 33:58.915
Can I sit
over there in the corner,

33:58.917 --> 34:00.383
bottom of the right?
We also have...

34:00.385 --> 34:01.484
Oh, this one right here?

34:01.486 --> 34:02.852
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

34:02.854 --> 34:04.687
Your server will
be right with you.

34:04.689 --> 34:07.924
The Halibut, with a
Graham cracker crumb crust,

34:07.926 --> 34:10.260
and lemon butter, for $39.95.

34:10.262 --> 34:11.893
I'll be right back.

34:13.030 --> 34:15.398
Did she just read us
the same special twice?

34:15.400 --> 34:17.367
I guess they're
pushing the Halibut.

34:17.369 --> 34:18.768
Hello?

34:18.770 --> 34:21.170
Hello, could we get a drink?

34:21.172 --> 34:23.973
"Whether you think you
can or you think you can't,"

34:23.975 --> 34:25.074
"you're right."

34:25.076 --> 34:26.141
Henry Ford.

34:28.112 --> 34:30.013
You can do this.

34:30.014 --> 34:31.714
Yeah, you can.

34:31.716 --> 34:32.782
All right.

34:33.784 --> 34:34.951
Looking good.

34:35.985 --> 34:36.819
Ooh.

34:36.821 --> 34:38.054
Oh, Luce.

34:38.056 --> 34:40.089
The stud on table 33
wants a Jack & Coke.

34:40.091 --> 34:41.157
Thanks.

34:52.036 --> 34:53.703
Lucy.

34:53.705 --> 34:54.704
Hi.

34:54.706 --> 34:55.772
Hi.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.207
Do you work here, or...

34:58.209 --> 34:59.609
Yes, yes I do.

35:00.911 --> 35:02.545
I, oh, this is for you.

35:02.547 --> 35:03.780
Jack & Coke.

35:03.782 --> 35:05.248
Thank you.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.883
I thought you said
you work in marketing?

35:06.885 --> 35:07.717
Oh, I do.

35:07.719 --> 35:09.218
Well, I did.

35:09.220 --> 35:13.022
But my ex-boyfriend fired
me after we broke up, so...

35:13.424 --> 35:14.490
Oh.

35:15.592 --> 35:16.626
I am sorry to hear that.

35:17.896 --> 35:20.296
Yeah, well, at least
I'm single now, right?

35:23.301 --> 35:24.934
I'd like a chardonnay,

35:24.936 --> 35:27.937
and my father
wants a Gibson, up.

35:27.939 --> 35:29.005
Yes.

35:31.342 --> 35:34.077
Um, I'm just, I'm
sorry, I'm gonna go do...

35:34.079 --> 35:35.511
Um, I'll be here.

35:35.513 --> 35:37.180
Okay.

35:37.182 --> 35:38.182
I'm gonna go.

35:43.387 --> 35:44.821
Hugo, favor.

35:44.823 --> 35:46.622
Um, Gibson, up, chardonnay
for the lady on 24.

35:46.624 --> 35:48.324
- Of course, mi amor.
- Thank you.

35:48.326 --> 35:49.992
Hey.

35:49.994 --> 35:51.928
- Ow!
- My office, now.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.496
God, so violent.

35:55.766 --> 35:57.166
Sit.
What?

35:58.335 --> 36:00.703
- I can't sit.
- Why not?

36:00.705 --> 36:02.585
Well if I sit, I'm gonna
have the urge to pee.

36:03.475 --> 36:04.874
- Sit!
- Oh god!

36:04.876 --> 36:06.642
Guitar teacher Graham is here.

36:06.644 --> 36:08.311
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

36:09.581 --> 36:11.381
Table 33, oh my
god, he is so hot.

36:11.383 --> 36:12.582
Right?

36:12.584 --> 36:13.983
He's even better-looking
than I remember him.

36:13.985 --> 36:15.385
Yeah well, it's
probably the dim lighting.

36:15.387 --> 36:17.320
Oh my god, I'm sweating.

36:17.322 --> 36:18.755
Okay, breathe.

36:18.757 --> 36:20.056
What do you think
he's doing here?

36:20.058 --> 36:21.557
I think he's here to see me.

36:21.559 --> 36:23.226
Uh, he randomly shows up
at a place you've worked

36:23.228 --> 36:24.694
for all of five minutes,

36:24.696 --> 36:26.829
and you think he's come to
whisk you away to some castle?

36:26.831 --> 36:28.965
No, he is not James Bond.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.267
I think I manifested him.

36:31.269 --> 36:33.369
Oh god, Lucy, we
have talked about this!

36:33.371 --> 36:34.437
Okay.

36:34.439 --> 36:35.805
"Synchronicity is a sign"

36:35.807 --> 36:37.707
"one is manifesting
their own reality."

36:37.709 --> 36:38.708
Anonymous.

36:38.710 --> 36:39.976
Blah, blah, blah.

36:39.978 --> 36:41.177
At this point, he is
out there right now.

36:41.179 --> 36:43.880
I mean, none of us
are gonna get this...

36:43.882 --> 36:45.782
- What?
- I think I just peed a little.

36:45.784 --> 36:47.784
- Ew!
- Oh my god, I just peed a lot.

36:47.786 --> 36:50.553
Okay, get out, get out!
Get out, out!

36:51.823 --> 36:52.922
Wait for it to pass.

36:52.924 --> 36:54.991
Door!
Door!

37:04.501 --> 37:06.569
Maybe it's his sister?

37:08.238 --> 37:11.240
Oh, how I miss my sisters.

37:12.443 --> 37:13.843
My life sucks.

37:17.315 --> 37:19.949
Hi, uh, where's the bathroom?

37:23.854 --> 37:25.221
Okay, thanks.

37:25.223 --> 37:26.722
Um, could you tell my waiter

37:26.724 --> 37:28.925
I'd like a Glenfiddich
on the rocks?

37:28.927 --> 37:29.992
Two cubes?

37:31.395 --> 37:32.462
Uh huh.

37:36.267 --> 37:38.668
There are other guys out there.

37:38.670 --> 37:40.002
I know.

37:40.004 --> 37:42.839
There's just something
about this one.

37:42.841 --> 37:46.275
Hang in there.

37:46.277 --> 37:47.343
Thank you.

38:02.459 --> 38:03.292
There she is.

38:03.294 --> 38:04.794
That's our waitress.

38:04.796 --> 38:06.128
Lucy, is this lady your guest?

38:06.130 --> 38:08.764
Yeah, I was just about...

38:08.766 --> 38:12.335
apparently she is eating
instead of taking care of us.

38:12.337 --> 38:14.804
My father is a shareholder
in this corporation,

38:14.806 --> 38:17.607
and I am very dissatisfied
with out service.

38:17.609 --> 38:19.408
Yes, I absolutely understand.

38:19.410 --> 38:21.377
Lucy, can I speak to
you in the office?

38:21.379 --> 38:23.279
- Now!
- Oh, okay, mmhmm.

38:40.098 --> 38:41.163
Ah.

38:46.704 --> 38:49.539
Peeing outside is true freedom.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.440
Why is it only guys
get to do that?

38:54.379 --> 38:56.846
You know, I've never
been fired in my life.

38:56.848 --> 38:59.782
Now I've been fired
twice in a month.

38:59.784 --> 39:02.552
Well, there goes your
parents' lifelong dream

39:02.554 --> 39:05.221
of their daughter
being a waitress.

39:05.223 --> 39:06.422
They'll adjust over time.

39:10.227 --> 39:13.296
Sorry about guitar teacher.

39:13.298 --> 39:14.130
Thank you.

39:14.132 --> 39:15.197
Mmhmm.

39:16.733 --> 39:19.936
You know, according to
the laws of attraction,

39:19.938 --> 39:22.738
I manifested all of this.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.040
Sure, you did.

39:26.743 --> 39:27.944
Hey.

39:27.946 --> 39:29.745
Nectar texted me.

39:29.747 --> 39:31.981
Apparently, Josh Hartnett's
in Italy shooting something

39:31.983 --> 39:34.250
for like the next six weeks.

39:34.252 --> 39:35.318
Seriously?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.385
Yup.

39:37.654 --> 39:38.988
This game is jinxed.

39:38.990 --> 39:40.489
I know, these
stupid movie stars.

39:40.491 --> 39:44.360
Don't they know that we're
trying to play a game here?

39:45.162 --> 39:46.495
So what happens to her now?

39:46.497 --> 39:50.499
Well, apparently she
gets to pick a new mark.

39:51.501 --> 39:52.969
Hey.

39:52.971 --> 39:56.038
Maybe you'd like
to pick a new mark?

39:57.407 --> 39:58.541
What?

39:58.543 --> 39:59.809
Hate the game.

39:59.811 --> 40:01.043
Not the playa.

40:03.047 --> 40:04.046
Did you see that?

40:04.048 --> 40:04.880
Playa!

40:04.882 --> 40:06.015
How could I miss it?

40:06.017 --> 40:07.617
Word!

40:07.619 --> 40:09.885
Ugh, makes me want to throw up.

40:09.887 --> 40:10.720
I love you.

40:10.722 --> 40:11.921
Love you more.

40:11.923 --> 40:12.922
Love you mean it.

40:12.924 --> 40:15.391
Love you mean it, mean it.

40:15.393 --> 40:16.659
Let's grow old together.

40:16.661 --> 40:18.494
Let's say friends forever.

40:18.496 --> 40:20.029
Nectar can be our nurse.

40:20.031 --> 40:21.031
Yeah.

40:21.899 --> 40:23.265
Our hot nurse.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.086
Hmm.

40:44.088 --> 40:45.154
Ooh.

40:48.393 --> 40:50.059
This dress is $214?

40:51.028 --> 40:52.461
I said I was paying.

40:52.463 --> 40:54.363
I know, I just like
to hear you say it.

40:54.365 --> 40:56.966
Who in their right
mind has a themed wedding?

40:56.968 --> 41:00.102
Do not talk about my
future best friend that way.

41:00.104 --> 41:01.871
Fairy tale or
love, those are themes.

41:01.873 --> 41:03.005
But 80s prom?

41:04.875 --> 41:05.941
Well I love this decade.

41:05.943 --> 41:07.410
We really missed out.

41:07.412 --> 41:11.514
Yeah, too bad your mom
didn't get knocked up at 12.

41:12.315 --> 41:13.983
Please, don't!

41:14.819 --> 41:16.052
Do not post that.

41:16.054 --> 41:18.320
I feel like the nerd in
all those 80s movies.

41:18.322 --> 41:19.955
That's awesome.

41:19.957 --> 41:20.957
Maybe, if I had a date.

41:21.626 --> 41:22.692
Ow!

41:23.794 --> 41:24.960
I hit on two guys yesterday.

41:24.962 --> 41:26.729
It was great.

41:26.731 --> 41:28.297
Hang on a second.

41:28.299 --> 41:30.533
You're just hitting on
any guy you see now?

41:30.535 --> 41:32.034
No, just the hot ones.

41:32.036 --> 41:34.403
Yesterday, I had lunch with
George, from the market.

41:34.405 --> 41:37.873
And then, I met this hot
guy at the Coronado pub.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.408
We're gonna have dinner tonight.

41:39.410 --> 41:42.244
He's really hot, but just
got out of a relationship.

41:42.246 --> 41:44.080
Okay, so you hit on them?

41:44.082 --> 41:45.614
They didn't approach you?

41:45.616 --> 41:46.716
No, it was all me.

41:46.718 --> 41:47.783
Oh!

41:48.719 --> 41:51.353
I even printed
these little cards

41:51.355 --> 41:53.989
with my name and number on 'em.

41:53.991 --> 41:56.258
So much faster than
typing it in their phone.

41:56.260 --> 41:57.326
Hey.

41:57.328 --> 41:59.395
Random thought.

41:59.397 --> 42:01.097
Maybe we should just go stag?

42:01.933 --> 42:02.898
Stop right there.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.166
You should go back in there,

42:04.168 --> 42:06.769
and really do something
to get his attention.

42:06.771 --> 42:07.937
You don't think the
projectile vomiting

42:07.939 --> 42:10.673
was attention-grabbing enough?

42:10.675 --> 42:12.742
What would be more painful;

42:12.744 --> 42:14.477
Going back into the bar,

42:14.479 --> 42:16.245
or knowing you could have
taken the man of your dreams

42:16.247 --> 42:19.548
to the wedding of the
year, fallen in love,

42:19.550 --> 42:23.786
and had a video game partner
for the rest of your life?

42:25.056 --> 42:26.555
Fine.

42:26.557 --> 42:29.158
You know, the brain can only
register one pain at a time,

42:29.160 --> 42:33.395
so, just imagine something more
painful than asking him out.

42:36.333 --> 42:38.334
Yes, that right there.

42:38.336 --> 42:40.336
Go do that, and
then ask him out.

42:40.338 --> 42:42.171
Do you like these earrings?

42:52.149 --> 42:53.215
Psst!

42:54.117 --> 42:55.384
No.

42:55.386 --> 42:57.486
My sweet little cupcake
has come back for me?

42:57.488 --> 42:58.354
- Yes ma'am?
- Is Roy here?

42:58.356 --> 42:59.355
No, it's his day off.

42:59.357 --> 43:00.422
Oh, great.

43:01.424 --> 43:03.592
Thank you for the loaners.

43:03.594 --> 43:05.294
No, no, no, darling,
where you going?

43:05.296 --> 43:06.529
Stay!

43:06.531 --> 43:07.530
Let Hugo make you
some coffee, please.

43:07.532 --> 43:08.831
Thanks but no, I've got to run.

43:08.833 --> 43:10.099
I'm going to be in charge.

43:10.101 --> 43:10.933
You're going to be in where?

43:10.935 --> 43:12.301
I'm back in the game.

43:12.303 --> 43:13.402
But isn't your man taken?

43:13.404 --> 43:14.403
Yes.

43:14.405 --> 43:15.638
Isn't it great?

43:15.640 --> 43:17.072
Clearly, fate has
another plan for me.

43:17.074 --> 43:18.874
No, Mija, now you have to stay.

43:18.876 --> 43:20.442
Okay, please, stay
and tell Hugo more.

43:20.444 --> 43:21.377
Okay, fine.

43:21.379 --> 43:22.311
Okay.

43:22.313 --> 43:23.512
So there's this guy at yoga...

43:23.514 --> 43:25.047
Uh huh.

43:25.049 --> 43:26.549
Apparently the universe
has put him in front of me

43:26.551 --> 43:28.551
every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday for the last year,

43:28.553 --> 43:31.353
but I was too blinded
by Marcus to notice him.

43:31.355 --> 43:32.454
And what's his name?

43:32.456 --> 43:34.356
Hot yoga guy.

43:34.358 --> 43:35.658
You two sound close.

43:35.660 --> 43:36.792
I think his name is Jason.

43:36.794 --> 43:38.460
- Mmhmm.
- I'm sure it's Jason.

43:38.462 --> 43:40.763
It doesn't matter.
Names aren't important.

43:40.765 --> 43:42.064
The important thing is that
I'm an in-control adult

43:42.066 --> 43:44.033
and I am plunging forward.

43:44.035 --> 43:45.968
Plunging?
Like a toilet?

43:45.970 --> 43:47.036
No, not like a toilet.

43:47.038 --> 43:49.305
I'm moving forward like a...

43:49.307 --> 43:50.840
It doesn't matter.

43:50.842 --> 43:52.708
The important thing is that
I am going to yoga right now

43:52.710 --> 43:55.878
to ask out the possible
future love of my life.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.112
I see.

43:57.114 --> 43:58.380
And when will all
this be taking place?

43:58.382 --> 44:01.784
15 to 18 minutes,
depending on traffic.

44:01.786 --> 44:04.019
Ay.

44:04.021 --> 44:05.287
Hey, I was just wondering...

44:05.289 --> 44:06.856
Membership number?

44:06.858 --> 44:08.424
Oh, um, 13069.

44:08.426 --> 44:10.693
Actually I was wondering if
I could get a phone number?

44:10.695 --> 44:11.627
1-800-yoga...

44:11.629 --> 44:13.362
I meant a, a member's number?

44:13.364 --> 44:14.597
Whose?

44:14.599 --> 44:16.465
Jason something?

44:16.467 --> 44:17.299
Yeah, I'm gonna need more.

44:17.301 --> 44:18.801
Oh, um, okay.

44:18.803 --> 44:21.503
So he's tall, blonde, he
does an amazing handstand.

44:21.505 --> 44:23.038
Does he have a tat
on his left calf?

44:23.040 --> 44:23.873
Yes!

44:23.875 --> 44:25.241
His number!

44:25.243 --> 44:26.375
No.

44:26.377 --> 44:27.509
Wait, what?

44:27.511 --> 44:29.245
It's against policy.

44:29.247 --> 44:31.747
I thought maybe, you
know, girl to girl...

44:31.749 --> 44:33.015
girl-to-girl tends
to be a little bit more

44:33.017 --> 44:34.216
bitchy and catty.

44:34.218 --> 44:37.219
We don't really bond
like the men do.

44:40.156 --> 44:41.790
Can I start over?

44:42.859 --> 44:44.860
Okay, so I've got this
bet going with my,

44:44.862 --> 44:46.829
well it's more of a game
going with my friends that um,

44:46.831 --> 44:48.397
I'll hit on this guy and
take him to this wedding.

44:48.399 --> 44:50.266
And um, okay, long story short,

44:50.268 --> 44:53.035
the guy I picked
has a girlfriend.

44:53.037 --> 44:56.338
And I found out because he was
kissing her in front of me.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.172
No shit?

44:57.174 --> 44:58.407
Yes, shit!

44:58.409 --> 45:00.075
So now I'm trying to
come up with that guy

45:00.077 --> 45:02.378
who could potentially be
my true love and I thought,

45:02.380 --> 45:03.913
"maybe hot yoga guy in"...

45:05.116 --> 45:06.582
This is all so humiliating.

45:06.584 --> 45:08.751
No, stop right there.

45:08.753 --> 45:10.452
You got a pen?

45:10.454 --> 45:11.520
Oh my...

45:12.622 --> 45:15.925
I was visualizing
a positive outcome.

45:18.229 --> 45:19.528
<i>Hey, you've reached me.</i>

45:19.530 --> 45:20.596
<i>Do your thing.</i>

45:20.598 --> 45:22.264
Hi, howdy, hello!

45:23.400 --> 45:24.867
How's it hangin'?

45:25.969 --> 45:29.271
Um, hi, it's Lucy
from yoga class.

45:29.273 --> 45:31.674
More specifically, it's
Lucy from 7:00 A.M. flow,

45:31.676 --> 45:33.575
back row, teal mat.

45:33.577 --> 45:35.778
Although full disclosure,
the teal mat is new,

45:35.780 --> 45:37.346
so you may not
recognize me by it.

45:37.348 --> 45:38.948
I used to have a red mat.

45:38.950 --> 45:41.283
Well, more of a
reddish, kind of brown,

45:41.285 --> 45:44.620
like a maroon, or
maybe a plumb dealio.

45:47.424 --> 45:48.490
Moving on...

45:49.793 --> 45:53.762
I thought because you sometimes
stare at me in down dog...

45:55.098 --> 45:56.332
Stare might be too strong a
word, now that I think about it.

45:56.334 --> 45:58.500
I do occasionally
wear bright colors.

45:58.502 --> 46:00.803
Maybe you've just been distracted
by me and my brightness,

46:00.805 --> 46:03.205
like, one would be distracted
by a crossing guard

46:03.207 --> 46:05.841
in the street so you
stop and don't hit them.

46:07.311 --> 46:08.944
<i>If you're
satisfied with your message,</i>

46:08.946 --> 46:10.079
<i>press one.</i>

46:10.081 --> 46:12.781
<i>To delete and
re-record, press two.</i>

46:19.957 --> 46:21.857
Thank you, universe.

46:56.093 --> 46:57.426
Just relax...

46:58.461 --> 46:59.962
Ah, there you go.

47:01.164 --> 47:02.231
Mmm.

47:22.786 --> 47:24.019
Namaste all.

47:38.302 --> 47:39.301
Fuck!

47:39.303 --> 47:40.303
Fuck, fuck!

47:42.973 --> 47:44.173
Shit!

47:44.175 --> 47:45.007
I am...

47:45.009 --> 47:46.275
I am so sorry!

47:46.277 --> 47:48.243
I just forgot that
I was in yoga class.

47:48.245 --> 47:50.212
I think you broke my nose!

47:55.052 --> 47:56.351
Oh, God.

47:56.353 --> 47:57.953
I feel really bad.

47:57.955 --> 47:59.455
I'm usually quite
a peaceful person.

47:59.457 --> 48:00.422
I have never hurt anyone.

48:00.424 --> 48:01.623
I am a pacifist.

48:01.625 --> 48:02.458
Do you have another tissue?

48:02.460 --> 48:03.859
Um, yes.

48:15.705 --> 48:18.140
Sometimes love
comes in a whisper,

48:18.142 --> 48:21.376
sometimes it smacks
you over the head.

48:22.479 --> 48:25.214
Aaron, do you believe in fate?

48:25.216 --> 48:26.682
Do you think that it's possible,

48:26.684 --> 48:28.984
and I'm not trying to
shirk responsibility here,

48:28.986 --> 48:31.186
do you think that it's
possible that the universe

48:31.188 --> 48:33.489
propelled me to bolt
upright and break your nose,

48:33.491 --> 48:35.457
forcing us together
in a hybrid car

48:35.459 --> 48:38.594
at 44 miles per gallon on
the way to the hospital?

48:38.596 --> 48:39.661
Well, fate,

48:40.797 --> 48:41.864
do you?

48:44.033 --> 48:44.867
You know what?

48:44.869 --> 48:45.868
That's okay.

48:45.870 --> 48:47.503
Opposites attract, right?

48:47.505 --> 48:48.804
I don't know what
you're doing Friday,

48:48.806 --> 48:51.540
but if you're free,
maybe, just maybe,

48:51.542 --> 48:54.643
you would be available to...

48:54.645 --> 48:55.711
Aaron?

48:56.412 --> 48:57.446
Aaron?

49:51.267 --> 49:52.601
Hey.

49:52.603 --> 49:54.469
- What time's your date?
- Which one?

49:54.471 --> 49:55.737
<i>The guy from the corona...</i>

49:55.739 --> 49:57.806
You have more than one?

49:57.808 --> 49:59.007
Yep.

49:59.009 --> 50:01.843
I met another guy
today, and he is hot.

50:01.845 --> 50:03.445
Wow, you're juggling guys?

50:03.447 --> 50:04.613
Yeah.

50:04.615 --> 50:05.547
It's awesome, right?

50:05.549 --> 50:07.149
I feel like a boy.

50:07.151 --> 50:08.684
I'm having scheduling issues.

50:08.686 --> 50:12.921
First, I'm meeting date
number one for happy hour.

50:14.290 --> 50:16.158
And then I have to be home
in time for date number two

50:16.160 --> 50:17.359
to pick me up at eight.

50:17.361 --> 50:18.627
That sounds so amazing.

50:18.629 --> 50:19.629
Yeah.

50:20.965 --> 50:22.264
But it sure is a lot of
work with hair and makeup.

50:22.266 --> 50:24.166
I feel like I have two day jobs.

50:24.168 --> 50:25.234
Ugh.

50:25.236 --> 50:26.435
Jealous.

50:26.437 --> 50:27.803
Well what are you doing?

50:27.805 --> 50:29.771
Well, I tried to meditate.

50:29.773 --> 50:31.740
And how did that go?

50:31.742 --> 50:33.775
I'm cleaning my fridge.

50:33.777 --> 50:35.143
That bad, huh?

50:35.145 --> 50:36.979
I attempted to hit on
my yoga teacher today.

50:36.981 --> 50:38.046
Ooh, and?

50:39.148 --> 50:40.649
I think I need therapy.

50:40.651 --> 50:42.818
I mean my body
would not cooperate.

50:42.820 --> 50:46.688
I mean, all I had to say was,
"Will you go out with me?"

50:46.690 --> 50:47.956
So what's stopping you?

50:47.958 --> 50:49.258
I don't know.

50:49.260 --> 50:51.760
It's not even like
he was conscious.

50:51.762 --> 50:52.728
What?

50:52.730 --> 50:53.795
Oh, and I broke his nose.

50:53.797 --> 50:55.397
You broke his nose?

50:55.399 --> 50:56.999
Yeah, don't ask.

50:57.001 --> 50:59.835
Are you still going with
Ryann to Edendale later?

50:59.837 --> 51:01.069
Oh, yeah.

51:01.071 --> 51:02.671
Operation Chris
is in full effect.

51:02.673 --> 51:04.906
Although, truth be told,
I have not seen her yet,

51:04.908 --> 51:06.008
so who knows?

51:06.010 --> 51:06.975
Well, it should be fun.

51:06.977 --> 51:07.976
Take notes.

51:07.978 --> 51:09.311
Oh, I will not only take notes,

51:09.313 --> 51:11.413
I will highlight them,
bullet point them,

51:11.415 --> 51:13.048
and career them over to you.

51:13.050 --> 51:16.885
And that is why
I love you so much.

52:20.250 --> 52:22.417
Too many people don't
understand politics.

52:22.419 --> 52:23.785
That's a problem.

52:23.787 --> 52:26.221
They vote, but they're
ignorant about the real issues.

52:26.223 --> 52:28.223
Well, I listen to the debates.

52:28.225 --> 52:29.691
I think a lot of people do.

52:30.627 --> 52:31.893
The debates tell you nothing.

52:31.895 --> 52:34.129
They tell you some things.

52:34.131 --> 52:35.630
No, nothing.

52:35.632 --> 52:38.600
Listening to the
debates is like...

52:40.036 --> 52:41.970
You said you watch
basketball, right?

52:41.972 --> 52:43.438
Yes.

52:43.440 --> 52:47.042
It's a fairly aggressive
sport for such a pretty girl,

52:47.577 --> 52:48.643
but I digress.

52:49.379 --> 52:52.147
Uh, listening to debates is like

52:52.149 --> 52:56.017
being a fair weather
fan in basketball.

52:56.019 --> 52:57.486
You don't pay attention to
your team all year long...

52:57.488 --> 53:00.489
I know what a
fair weather fan is.

53:00.491 --> 53:01.757
Great.

53:01.759 --> 53:05.327
So you understand my
fair weather analogy?

53:07.196 --> 53:08.029
Yeah.

53:08.031 --> 53:09.097
Um...

53:09.799 --> 53:10.899
I have a thing.

53:10.901 --> 53:12.934
I, I have to go.

53:12.936 --> 53:14.803
You don't have a thing.

53:14.805 --> 53:15.904
You're right.

53:15.906 --> 53:16.972
I don't.

53:16.974 --> 53:18.173
I have a date.

53:18.175 --> 53:19.007
That's right.

53:19.009 --> 53:20.075
I have another date.

53:20.077 --> 53:21.343
I scheduled two dates.

53:21.345 --> 53:24.246
Pretty aggressive
for a girl, hmm?

53:25.782 --> 53:26.848
Your loss.

53:31.722 --> 53:32.888
Wow.

53:32.890 --> 53:34.289
Yup.

53:34.291 --> 53:35.291
Huh.

53:37.594 --> 53:38.660
Who did this to you?

53:38.662 --> 53:40.128
Makeup counter at the mall.

53:40.130 --> 53:41.530
Huh.

53:41.532 --> 53:43.732
Oh, I feel like a cheap whore.

53:43.734 --> 53:46.535
Um, excuse me, those
are my $600 stilettos.

53:46.537 --> 53:48.136
You're an expensive whore.

53:48.972 --> 53:50.672
Well, you were right.

53:50.674 --> 53:52.441
But the blisters
on my feet and this

53:52.443 --> 53:53.875
thong riding up my crack,

53:53.877 --> 53:55.043
I barely have enough
brain space to worry about

53:55.045 --> 53:57.112
the humiliation of
walking into Chris' bar.

53:57.114 --> 53:58.313
That's the spirit.

53:59.817 --> 54:00.782
Okay, here I go.

54:00.784 --> 54:01.850
Okay.

54:02.618 --> 54:03.718
Oh hey.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.253
If I have a confession
before I kill,

54:05.255 --> 54:06.788
please tell Nectar that I
blame her for everything.

54:06.790 --> 54:08.023
My pleasure.

54:09.192 --> 54:10.425
Oh!

54:10.427 --> 54:11.293
Final words?

54:11.295 --> 54:12.561
Yes.

54:12.563 --> 54:14.963
"Leap with gusto, and
the nut shall appear."

54:14.965 --> 54:15.797
My mother.

54:15.799 --> 54:17.299
Well in that case,

54:17.301 --> 54:19.434
let's just hope I don't
plummet to my death, huh?

54:19.436 --> 54:20.936
Godspeed.

54:20.938 --> 54:21.970
Hey, meet me at the Reuben
truck when you're done.

54:21.972 --> 54:23.572
Yup, can't wait.

54:23.574 --> 54:24.406
Food.

54:24.408 --> 54:25.408
Whoops.

54:26.543 --> 54:27.943
Okay guys.

54:27.945 --> 54:28.777
Okay.

54:28.779 --> 54:29.845
Settle down.

54:37.454 --> 54:39.154
Hey!
Help!

54:39.156 --> 54:40.822
Lucy!

54:49.066 --> 54:50.432
Yep.

54:55.471 --> 54:57.639
What happened to your shoe?

54:57.641 --> 54:58.807
Oh.

54:58.809 --> 55:00.408
It's actually a really
hilarious story.

55:00.410 --> 55:02.244
I was outside, and I
stepped on a grate...

55:02.246 --> 55:03.245
yeah, you gotta have two shoes.

55:03.247 --> 55:05.347
Them's the rules.

55:05.349 --> 55:07.148
Okay, I just need to get
in for like two seconds,

55:07.150 --> 55:08.283
'cause there's this guy inside...

55:08.285 --> 55:10.619
you've been denied entry.

55:12.588 --> 55:14.389
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- You've been denied...

55:14.391 --> 55:15.490
Yeah!

55:15.492 --> 55:17.058
- All right.
- Entry.

55:21.964 --> 55:23.431
Heh.

55:23.433 --> 55:25.600
Take, take it out of the,

55:25.602 --> 55:27.736
take it out of the thing.

55:38.382 --> 55:39.614
Ow!

56:04.041 --> 56:04.973
No!

56:04.975 --> 56:07.075
No, no, no!

56:10.881 --> 56:11.947
Why?

56:14.150 --> 56:15.150
Oh!

56:16.453 --> 56:18.353
Oh my god.

56:18.355 --> 56:19.287
Chris?

56:19.289 --> 56:20.355
Ryann?

56:21.257 --> 56:24.159
Did you lose your glass
slipper, Cinderella?

56:24.161 --> 56:25.226
Sort of.

56:25.895 --> 56:27.062
Should I ask?

56:27.064 --> 56:28.763
I wouldn't.

56:28.765 --> 56:30.732
Yeah, you left pretty
quickly the other night.

56:30.734 --> 56:31.967
Yeah.

56:31.969 --> 56:34.703
Well, considering
the circumstances...

56:34.705 --> 56:36.304
Yeah, you know, I
wouldn't worry about that.

56:36.306 --> 56:39.874
I, I totally remember the
first time that I got drunk.

56:41.011 --> 56:42.010
Wow!

56:42.012 --> 56:43.111
Okay.

56:43.113 --> 56:44.346
I got nothin'.

56:45.748 --> 56:47.382
Well, you got one
really expensive shoe

56:47.384 --> 56:50.852
in a back alley, I'd say
that's, that's something.

56:50.854 --> 56:52.721
Wait, are you hitting on me?

56:52.723 --> 56:54.055
Maybe.

56:54.057 --> 56:55.590
No, no, no, stop.

56:55.592 --> 56:57.192
You can't.

56:57.194 --> 56:58.460
Why not?

56:58.462 --> 57:00.495
Because I'm supposed
to be hitting on you.

57:00.497 --> 57:01.563
Okay.

57:02.498 --> 57:03.865
Chris, here we go.

57:03.867 --> 57:05.000
Whoo!

57:05.002 --> 57:06.534
Chris...

57:06.536 --> 57:08.570
Shoot, what's your last name?

57:08.572 --> 57:09.404
Sandeson.

57:09.406 --> 57:10.405
Okay.

57:10.407 --> 57:11.339
Chris Sanderson,
will you be my...

57:11.341 --> 57:12.841
It's Sandeson.

57:12.843 --> 57:14.442
There's no r.

57:14.444 --> 57:16.411
Oh, okay, no r, got it.

57:16.413 --> 57:17.479
Chris...

57:18.414 --> 57:21.383
Sandeson, will you be my date?

57:21.385 --> 57:22.651
I'd love to.

57:22.653 --> 57:23.918
No, no, no, hold on,
I'm not finished yet.

57:23.920 --> 57:27.422
Will you be my date to
the best wedding ever?

57:28.691 --> 57:32.961
- Now?
- Yes, now!

57:32.963 --> 57:34.629
Yes.

57:34.631 --> 57:42.631
Word!

57:42.706 --> 57:44.839
That was actually my
first time at the Coronado.

57:44.841 --> 57:46.574
I just sort of wandered in.

57:46.576 --> 57:47.676
Oh, yeah?

57:47.678 --> 57:48.610
- Mmhmm.
- Oh that's great.

57:48.612 --> 57:50.745
It's like the coolest dive bar.

57:50.747 --> 57:51.680
You know, you got
Billy in the bar.

57:51.682 --> 57:54.215
You got James on the piano.

57:54.217 --> 57:55.316
Cheap whiskey all night.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.585
My band played a gig there.

57:57.587 --> 57:58.920
Our first gig.

58:08.964 --> 58:12.233
It was amazing.

58:12.235 --> 58:14.302
I felt like I was in a sweet
valley high romance novel.

58:14.304 --> 58:17.572
And then, and then, we
walked up to the grate

58:17.574 --> 58:20.041
and he busted the heel
off of that stiletto

58:20.043 --> 58:21.509
in order to get it out.

58:21.511 --> 58:23.511
It was so romantic!

58:23.513 --> 58:25.714
Okay, not if they're
my $600 stilettos.

58:25.716 --> 58:27.315
Oh, boo!

58:27.317 --> 58:30.185
Who needs money when
you got romance?

58:30.187 --> 58:31.786
Oh, did I mention
that he's funny?

58:31.788 --> 58:33.254
About 100 times.

58:33.256 --> 58:34.289
Oh my god, and he's so cute.

58:34.291 --> 58:35.623
Look at what he got me.

58:35.625 --> 58:36.791
Oh my god, put that thing away!

58:36.793 --> 58:37.992
We could get arrested!

58:37.994 --> 58:39.761
Oh my god, it's
medicinal, chill out.

58:39.763 --> 58:41.163
Oh my god, I feel
a cough coming on.

58:41.998 --> 58:42.998
Oh, God.

58:43.967 --> 58:44.899
Thank you.

58:44.901 --> 58:46.601
Hey, I am going to text Nectar

58:46.603 --> 58:49.104
and have her meet us
there after her date.

59:05.387 --> 59:06.454
Hi, date.

59:07.590 --> 59:09.090
Hey.

59:09.092 --> 59:11.459
So, tell me more
about your music.

59:11.461 --> 59:12.627
I love music.

59:13.662 --> 59:15.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:17.367 --> 59:18.967
Uh...

59:18.969 --> 59:20.902
Well my, my dad taught
me to play guitar.

59:20.904 --> 59:23.571
I've been playing it
since I was little.

59:23.573 --> 59:25.373
He used to always say that um,

59:25.375 --> 59:27.308
everybody's got some
music in their bones.

59:27.310 --> 59:28.343
Aw.

59:28.345 --> 59:29.544
I totally agree.

59:29.546 --> 59:31.713
I love, love, love music.

59:33.449 --> 59:34.949
Okay.

59:34.951 --> 59:37.018
What type of music
do you listen to?

59:37.020 --> 59:38.386
Uh-mmm,

59:38.388 --> 59:42.624
like, Katy Perry, Taylor
Swift, Josh Groban.

59:43.025 --> 59:44.092
Okay.

59:46.562 --> 59:47.796
Guess what?

59:47.798 --> 59:49.030
Hmm?

59:49.032 --> 59:50.272
I have an interview tomorrow.

59:50.500 --> 59:51.733
You do?

59:51.735 --> 59:53.334
- Mmhmm.
- Why didn't you tell me?

59:53.336 --> 59:54.569
I don't know.

59:54.571 --> 59:56.838
I guess, I feel like
it's my last shot,

59:56.840 --> 59:59.841
and I didn't want to jinx it.

01:00:01.478 --> 01:00:02.478
No.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:06.681
Come on.

01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:07.515
I can't.

01:00:07.517 --> 01:00:08.817
I can't get high.

01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:10.718
You always say that.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.387
Um, I always say
that because it's true.

01:00:12.389 --> 01:00:14.789
My body cannot get high.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.558
I bet you, you can get high

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.526
if you wrote it on a post-it.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.129
Oh, that's funny?

01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:23.231
That's not funny.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.766
Come on.

01:00:24.768 --> 01:00:28.937
Why don't you just live a
little for a change, huh?

01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:30.805
Hmm?

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:31.873
Fine!

01:00:36.312 --> 01:00:37.378
Ooh.

01:00:44.954 --> 01:00:46.020
So?

01:00:48.924 --> 01:00:50.625
- I feel nothing.
- Ugh!

01:00:50.627 --> 01:00:51.759
You are so frustrating.

01:00:51.761 --> 01:00:52.760
Ooh!

01:00:52.762 --> 01:00:53.595
- Ooh.
- I bet you that's them.

01:00:53.597 --> 01:00:54.696
Let's go hide, come on.

01:00:54.698 --> 01:00:55.563
- Hide?
- Behind the chair!

01:00:55.565 --> 01:00:56.798
Go, go, go, get up!

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.201
Ooh, ooh, behind here,
come on, come on!

01:01:05.941 --> 01:01:07.208
I wonder if they'll kiss.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.177
I wonder if they'll use tongue.

01:01:09.179 --> 01:01:10.545
The first kiss, you'll
remember for the rest

01:01:10.547 --> 01:01:11.713
of your relationship.

01:01:11.715 --> 01:01:14.682
It's the most
romantic thing ever.

01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:15.917
Oh, my God...

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.228
All right, um, that was fun.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:28.463
Yeah.

01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:30.164
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:32.967
Oh!

01:01:35.838 --> 01:01:36.871
Aha!

01:01:36.873 --> 01:01:38.873
I knew you could get high!

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:39.941
Yes!

01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:41.342
This is awesome.

01:01:41.344 --> 01:01:43.011
- Bye.
- Get, get home safe.

01:01:47.917 --> 01:01:48.950
And boo!

01:01:48.952 --> 01:01:49.952
Ah!

01:01:50.787 --> 01:01:52.020
You went out with my Graham?

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:53.721
What do you mean, your Graham?

01:01:53.723 --> 01:01:55.223
Guitar teacher.

01:01:56.525 --> 01:01:57.525
That?

01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:58.760
He?

01:01:58.762 --> 01:02:00.361
That, that he, that
was your Graham?

01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:01.596
Yes, Nectar.

01:02:01.598 --> 01:02:03.498
That, he, that,
that is my Graham.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.366
You know what?
I wouldn't listen to her.

01:02:05.368 --> 01:02:06.434
I think she's kind of high.

01:02:06.436 --> 01:02:07.235
- Lucy...
- For the last time,

01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:08.436
I can't get high!

01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:11.205
Lucy, I had no idea
that was your guy.

01:02:11.207 --> 01:02:13.207
I have a crush on a Graham,

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:14.275
you go out with a Graham,

01:02:14.277 --> 01:02:15.476
and you don't think about it?

01:02:15.478 --> 01:02:16.544
Oh...

01:02:17.413 --> 01:02:18.646
I met him at a
dive bar one night.

01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:19.614
He was talking to
me about how he just

01:02:19.616 --> 01:02:20.782
broke up with his girlfriend,

01:02:20.784 --> 01:02:22.016
and she was in London
and he was here,

01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:23.418
and he was waiting
for her to come back

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.619
so he could do it in
person and he just turned...

01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:25.820
- Stop talking!
- Into this whole...

01:02:25.822 --> 01:02:27.522
it doesn't matter,
you kissed him, Nectar,

01:02:27.524 --> 01:02:28.656
you can't take that back!

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.758
For the record, I leaned in.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.060
I kissed him.

01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:35.096
I've been going out with
the wrong guys all week,

01:02:35.098 --> 01:02:36.831
just based on what
they looked like,

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.200
so I wanted to know if
we had any chemistry.

01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:40.268
Which we didn't.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:41.502
We have nothing in common.

01:02:41.504 --> 01:02:42.670
He doesn't want me,
I don't want him...

01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:45.606
So, now he's the wrong guy?

01:02:45.608 --> 01:02:46.541
Wow.

01:02:46.543 --> 01:02:48.710
My dream guy is the wrong guy.

01:02:48.712 --> 01:02:50.011
I really think we
should look at this

01:02:50.013 --> 01:02:51.479
as the glass is half full.

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:54.315
He's available, he's single,
and I don't want him.

01:02:54.317 --> 01:02:55.550
You are unbelievable!

01:02:55.552 --> 01:02:57.051
I have been dreaming
about this guy,

01:02:57.053 --> 01:02:59.387
manifesting our life together
for the last however long,

01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:00.321
and you pick him
up for one night

01:03:00.323 --> 01:03:01.789
and you don't want him?

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:02.623
No.

01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:03.624
Say you want him.

01:03:03.626 --> 01:03:04.892
But I don't want him.

01:03:04.894 --> 01:03:06.060
Say...

01:03:06.062 --> 01:03:06.894
You want him.

01:03:06.896 --> 01:03:07.729
Lucy...

01:03:07.731 --> 01:03:08.563
Say it!

01:03:08.565 --> 01:03:10.365
I really don't.

01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:11.566
Say you want him!

01:03:11.568 --> 01:03:13.034
Oh, would you
just say it already?

01:03:13.036 --> 01:03:14.635
All right, fine!

01:03:14.637 --> 01:03:15.703
I want him.

01:03:16.405 --> 01:03:17.372
There, you happy?

01:03:17.374 --> 01:03:18.639
Yes.

01:03:18.641 --> 01:03:20.675
Yes, Nectar, I am
very, very happy!

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:23.044
Lucy, you are
out of control right now!

01:03:23.046 --> 01:03:24.379
Well maybe I need to be
a little out of control

01:03:24.381 --> 01:03:26.214
for a change!

01:03:26.216 --> 01:03:28.016
- Luce...
- You cannot come in!

01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:29.517
Get off my porch!

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.887
Whoo!

01:03:32.889 --> 01:03:34.422
What just happened?

01:03:34.424 --> 01:03:35.857
I don't know, but for five
bucks, I'll drive you home.

01:03:35.859 --> 01:03:36.691
What?

01:03:36.693 --> 01:03:38.059
Okay, three.

01:03:38.061 --> 01:03:40.228
But that is my final offer.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.663
This is ridiculous,
I had no idea...

01:03:42.665 --> 01:03:44.198
And I want you to
think about what you've done,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.266
young lady.

01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:00.281
Howdy, neighbor.

01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:02.450
Hi, Ed.

01:04:02.452 --> 01:04:03.651
Your mail came
to my house again.

01:04:03.653 --> 01:04:04.619
Although at this point,
I'm pretty convinced

01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:06.087
you're stuffing it in my box,

01:04:06.089 --> 01:04:08.022
so I have to come over here
to bring it back to you.

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:10.091
#Ithinkyou'rehittingonme.

01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:12.560
It's working.

01:04:15.432 --> 01:04:16.931
What are you all dressed up for?

01:04:16.933 --> 01:04:19.000
You know, I just had to
run out to the pharmacy.

01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:20.435
Oh, yeah?

01:04:20.437 --> 01:04:23.071
You've probably seen me taking
out the trash in my tux.

01:04:23.073 --> 01:04:26.274
Hey, you didn't by chance DVR
the clippers game, did you?

01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:27.175
You know I did.

01:04:27.177 --> 01:04:28.676
That's my girl!

01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:32.747
Oh.

01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:34.082
Did you want to come in?

01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:35.149
Okay, okay.

01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:36.284
Arm twisted.

01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:37.785
Yeah, you sound desperate.

01:04:37.787 --> 01:04:38.619
Where you going?

01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:39.454
Beer.

01:04:39.456 --> 01:04:41.489
Ed must get beer.

01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:42.657
Pepperoni and
mushroom work for you?

01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:44.926
Extra pepperoni?

01:04:44.928 --> 01:04:47.295
My dinner was awful.

01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:48.496
They serve dinner
at the pharmacy?

01:04:48.498 --> 01:04:49.498
Ow!

01:04:52.367 --> 01:04:53.634
Come on, come on,
come on, come on,

01:04:53.636 --> 01:04:54.902
come on, come on,
come on, come on,

01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:55.636
come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:04:55.638 --> 01:04:56.537
Oh!

01:04:56.539 --> 01:04:57.539
Poo!

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.307
What happened?

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:00.308
We just fouled out!

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.009
Motherfu-eh.

01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:03.244
Whoa, hey!

01:05:03.246 --> 01:05:05.880
Model with a potty
mouth, watch it.

01:05:05.882 --> 01:05:07.982
Go on, say it, I dare you.

01:05:07.984 --> 01:05:08.816
No.

01:05:08.818 --> 01:05:09.650
Come on.

01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:11.519
Motherfuckers!

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:13.020
Yeah.

01:05:13.957 --> 01:05:14.957
Freedom!

01:05:16.225 --> 01:05:17.458
Beautiful.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.292
I'm proud of you.

01:05:18.294 --> 01:05:19.494
By the end of the night,

01:05:19.496 --> 01:05:20.528
we'll have you lighting
your farts on fire.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:21.996
Is that a real thing?

01:05:21.998 --> 01:05:22.997
The blue flame?

01:05:22.999 --> 01:05:24.098
No joke.

01:05:25.101 --> 01:05:26.267
I'm in.

01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:27.269
Set it up.

01:05:55.298 --> 01:05:56.964
I am the master of my fate.

01:05:56.966 --> 01:05:58.466
I can because I say I can.

01:05:58.468 --> 01:06:01.636
Happiness is a choice, and
I'm making it right now.

01:06:01.638 --> 01:06:02.470
Great.

01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:03.472
Now I feel better.

01:06:17.921 --> 01:06:19.620
Oh, my God!

01:06:19.622 --> 01:06:20.622
Oh, my God!

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:22.890
Oh, my God!

01:06:22.892 --> 01:06:24.258
Oh, my God!

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:28.563
Oh, my God!

01:06:28.565 --> 01:06:29.897
Oh, my God!

01:06:29.899 --> 01:06:31.199
Oh, my God, how embarrassing.

01:06:31.201 --> 01:06:32.201
Oh, god.

01:06:33.235 --> 01:06:34.235
Oh.

01:06:37.172 --> 01:06:38.172
Oh, my God!

01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:40.174
Oh, shit!

01:06:40.176 --> 01:06:41.509
I must have started my...

01:06:41.511 --> 01:06:42.343
started your what?

01:06:42.345 --> 01:06:43.177
You know?

01:06:43.179 --> 01:06:44.011
You know.

01:06:44.013 --> 01:06:44.946
You know!

01:06:44.948 --> 01:06:46.681
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:47.882
Holy shit.

01:06:47.884 --> 01:06:49.650
You totally crimson
mustached me!

01:06:49.652 --> 01:06:51.285
Oh!

01:06:51.287 --> 01:06:52.220
Oh, God.

01:06:52.222 --> 01:06:53.988
Oh, I just tasted it.

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.790
Oh, my tongue just tasted it!

01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:09.203
Are you okay in there?

01:07:09.205 --> 01:07:10.205
Ed?

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.542
Can I borrow your toothbrush?

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:19.747
I'm kidding!

01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:22.250
I'm kidding, I'm totally,
totally joking with you.

01:07:22.252 --> 01:07:23.284
I'm sorry!

01:07:24.554 --> 01:07:25.786
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

01:07:25.788 --> 01:07:26.721
- Don't sweat it, babe.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:26.723 --> 01:07:28.322
It's fine.

01:07:28.324 --> 01:07:31.392
Besides, I was a
little low on iron.

01:07:36.498 --> 01:07:38.032
Come on.

01:07:38.034 --> 01:07:40.868
Let's go light
our farts on fire.

01:07:43.538 --> 01:07:44.538
You know you love it.

01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.651
We're interviewing several
candidates for this position.

01:08:30.653 --> 01:08:31.719
Great.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.953
I thrive in
competitive situations.

01:08:32.955 --> 01:08:34.522
Give me three reasons
why I should hire you.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:35.956
Um...

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:38.526
I have excellent leadership
and delegation skills.

01:08:38.528 --> 01:08:41.562
In the past year, I
was the head of two

01:08:41.564 --> 01:08:43.229
multimillion dollar campaigns,

01:08:43.232 --> 01:08:45.966
and I have seven years social
media marketing experience

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:47.535
as an account manager.

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:49.870
At Lowitz Murphy, you'd start
out as an account assistant.

01:08:49.872 --> 01:08:51.339
Great.

01:08:51.341 --> 01:08:53.640
I am happy to learn and share
my knowledge at any level.

01:08:53.643 --> 01:08:55.176
It would be mostly learning.

01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:57.011
We're very different
from Kosner.

01:08:57.013 --> 01:08:58.479
I'm always up for a challenge.

01:08:58.481 --> 01:08:59.647
Oh.

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:02.049
You worked under Marcus
Krevogate Kosner?

01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:03.216
I did.

01:09:03.219 --> 01:09:05.019
I know Marcus.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.120
Really?

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:07.321
NYU.

01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:09.823
The guy is the
life of the party.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560
And um...

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.395
You...

01:09:15.398 --> 01:09:16.863
Quit?

01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:18.165
Yes.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:19.200
Um...

01:09:19.202 --> 01:09:21.569
Technically I was uh...

01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:23.069
Well, you know what?

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:24.171
You probably don't want
to be technical about it.

01:09:24.173 --> 01:09:25.840
Yes, let's do.

01:09:25.841 --> 01:09:27.006
I was let go.

01:09:27.009 --> 01:09:28.609
Conflict of interest.

01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.044
Marcus fired you?

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:31.511
Yes.

01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:33.948
After three years of dating,
Mr. Wonderful dumped me,

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:35.448
and then fired me.

01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:37.017
And of course, the one real
interview I managed to get

01:09:37.019 --> 01:09:39.587
in 32 days, he ruins that too.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:42.423
Let's just cut the
crap, shall we?

01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:44.325
You're not gonna hire me
because I was fired by

01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:45.559
your old college buddy.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.794
But you know what?

01:09:46.796 --> 01:09:49.630
As a marketing genius,
this job is well beneath

01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:51.765
my talent and experience.

01:09:53.135 --> 01:09:54.635
Here's the part where you
say you'll be in touch.

01:09:54.637 --> 01:09:56.771
And I go home and decorate
my walls with post-it notes

01:09:56.773 --> 01:09:58.706
full of positive affirmations
trying to control my way

01:09:58.708 --> 01:10:00.274
to happiness while I wait
for the phone to ring.

01:10:00.276 --> 01:10:01.509
But you know what
I need much more

01:10:01.511 --> 01:10:03.043
than a shopping
spree at staples,

01:10:03.045 --> 01:10:05.212
followed by an evening of
fine point finger smudges

01:10:05.214 --> 01:10:06.447
and paper cuts?

01:10:06.449 --> 01:10:07.715
Do you know?

01:10:07.717 --> 01:10:09.850
I need a date, to tonight's wedding!

01:10:09.852 --> 01:10:12.586
And if that means I need to
get a little out of control,

01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:14.054
so, be it!

01:10:14.056 --> 01:10:17.691
Life's out of control,
and from now on, so am I.

01:10:20.329 --> 01:10:23.364
I am leaving now because
I will not let you

01:10:23.366 --> 01:10:25.266
and Marcus be my fate.

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:50.024
Goodbye, my friend.

01:10:50.026 --> 01:10:51.091
I'll miss you.

01:10:59.535 --> 01:11:01.035
Hello?

01:11:01.037 --> 01:11:01.836
Please forgive me,
I was selfish and guarded

01:11:01.838 --> 01:11:03.137
and so much more.

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:04.171
I forgive you, I forgive you,

01:11:04.173 --> 01:11:05.706
and I am so sorry...

01:11:05.708 --> 01:11:08.042
no need to apologize, I
just need Graham's number.

01:11:08.044 --> 01:11:09.210
I'm gonna do it.

01:11:09.212 --> 01:11:10.344
Oh, yay!

01:11:10.346 --> 01:11:12.179
That is so wonderful.

01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:14.215
I don't have his number
though, I gave him my card.

01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:15.149
Caller ID?

01:11:15.151 --> 01:11:16.151
Blocked.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.853
I am trying to do
the right thing here.

01:11:18.855 --> 01:11:20.888
Why won't the universe
cooperate with me?

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.923
Ooh, I know, I can Facebook him.

01:11:22.925 --> 01:11:25.159
You are Facebook
friends with him?

01:11:25.161 --> 01:11:28.295
Well, yeah, but I, I
Facebook all my dates.

01:11:28.297 --> 01:11:30.698
Okay, do you follow
any of the dating rules?

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.932
I'm sorry...

01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:33.167
It's okay, I'm gonna let this go

01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:34.168
because I know about your quest

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.870
to reach 1,000 Facebook friends.

01:11:35.872 --> 01:11:37.004
Oh, thank you.

01:11:37.006 --> 01:11:37.838
You're welcome.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.840
Um...

01:11:41.077 --> 01:11:42.343
Ooh, holy crow!

01:11:42.345 --> 01:11:43.511
What?

01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:44.478
Look, he just checked
in for happy hour

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.679
at the airliner downtown.

01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:47.114
Yes!

01:11:47.116 --> 01:11:49.984
I am no longer being
cockblocked by the universe!

01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:51.252
Wait, downtown?

01:11:55.658 --> 01:11:56.957
Ah!

01:11:59.729 --> 01:12:01.795
Can you just, can I...

01:13:13.135 --> 01:13:14.135
Whoo!

01:13:15.904 --> 01:13:16.904
Yeah, okay.

01:13:17.739 --> 01:13:18.572
Thanks for having me.

01:13:18.574 --> 01:13:20.741
Phil, you drinking?

01:13:20.743 --> 01:13:22.543
Oh, we told you not
to come here, Bart.

01:13:23.846 --> 01:13:24.678
Graham.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.680
Yeah?

01:13:26.681 --> 01:13:28.248
Oh, hey.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:29.450
Hey.

01:13:29.452 --> 01:13:30.284
Wow.

01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:31.286
Wow.

01:13:32.989 --> 01:13:34.555
Did you uh, did
you catch the gig?

01:13:34.557 --> 01:13:36.857
I did, well just the
end, but, um, it was great.

01:13:36.859 --> 01:13:39.059
You were, you were really,
you were really great.

01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:40.494
Thanks.

01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:42.630
How's um, how's the
wedding song coming along?

01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:43.664
Funny thing about that.

01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:45.265
I'm, um, it's actually tonight,

01:13:45.267 --> 01:13:46.834
and um, I'm not playing a song.

01:13:46.836 --> 01:13:48.068
Ah.

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.902
You get nervous,
change your mind?

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.104
Uh, no.

01:13:50.106 --> 01:13:52.039
I was never playing a song.

01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:53.674
The truth is, um...

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:58.379
I know I hardly know you,

01:13:58.381 --> 01:13:59.580
but from the moment I met you,

01:13:59.582 --> 01:14:02.316
I felt this unbelievable
connection, and...

01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:04.118
I know this is gonna
sound crazy but,

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.220
maybe I need to be a
little crazy, so...

01:14:06.222 --> 01:14:07.588
Here goes.

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:10.991
I would love more than
anything in the world

01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:14.895
for you to be my date
tonight to said wedding.

01:14:17.465 --> 01:14:18.966
What...

01:14:20.536 --> 01:14:22.302
Is that said wedding invitation?

01:14:22.304 --> 01:14:23.270
Yes.

01:14:23.272 --> 01:14:24.638
Said wedding invitation.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.206
And it's tonight,
and it's short notice

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.842
because it's at seven, and um...

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:30.711
Oh no wait, is it it
seven or is it eight?

01:14:30.713 --> 01:14:32.179
Oh, I think it's eight.

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:33.414
No, no, no, hang on, this
will just take a second, I'm...

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:34.248
It's...

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:35.449
I'm so sorry.

01:14:35.451 --> 01:14:38.752
I should have, take one
second, I'll just...

01:14:38.754 --> 01:14:41.121
It's so embarrassing.

01:14:41.123 --> 01:14:41.955
Nope.

01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:43.457
You know what?

01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:45.159
Who cares what time society
said we should get there?

01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:46.927
Let's just get there
when we feel like it.

01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:47.761
I got you a whiskey.

01:14:47.763 --> 01:14:48.763
Thank you sweetheart.

01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:52.266
Um...

01:14:52.268 --> 01:14:53.300
Lucy, Mel.

01:14:53.302 --> 01:14:54.835
Mel, Lucy.

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:58.672
But weren't you our
waitress the other night?

01:14:58.674 --> 01:15:00.107
I was.

01:15:00.109 --> 01:15:04.111
But you were a very good
waitress the other night, right?

01:15:08.817 --> 01:15:10.084
Lucy?

01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:11.086
Lucy!

01:15:33.508 --> 01:15:35.776
Mr. and Mrs. Masterson?

01:15:35.778 --> 01:15:36.710
Hi.

01:15:36.712 --> 01:15:37.978
I'm Ryann Becker.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.446
I went to precious
heart with Denise.

01:15:39.448 --> 01:15:41.348
- Oh.
- Oh, how lovely!

01:15:42.317 --> 01:15:43.317
Oh!

01:15:44.953 --> 01:15:46.186
Oh!

01:15:46.188 --> 01:15:47.521
You're the hot girl
in can't buy me love.

01:15:47.523 --> 01:15:49.556
Oh, yay, you got it!

01:15:49.558 --> 01:15:51.759
I was afraid everyone might
just think I was clumsy.

01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:53.060
I know!

01:15:53.062 --> 01:15:54.495
And I'm the
chicken in the movie.

01:15:54.497 --> 01:15:56.530
No, honey, you're the duck.

01:15:56.532 --> 01:15:57.731
From that pink movie.

01:15:57.733 --> 01:15:58.732
Ducky!

01:15:58.734 --> 01:16:00.300
Yes!

01:16:00.302 --> 01:16:01.735
I don't know, the
girls dressed me.

01:16:01.737 --> 01:16:05.105
Wow, I mean, not only is
Denise the coolest person ever,

01:16:05.107 --> 01:16:07.508
but she has the coolest parents.

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:08.542
Yeah, I mean, my parents
would never let me

01:16:08.544 --> 01:16:09.943
have a wedding like this.

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:11.979
Laura and Henry!

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:13.347
Oh, Elaine!

01:16:13.349 --> 01:16:14.348
Hey, Mel.

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:15.482
Hi, Elaine!

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:19.353
It was nice to see you.

01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:22.756
Ryann!

01:16:22.758 --> 01:16:23.991
Hi!

01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:24.993
Hey!

01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:27.561
Cool.

01:16:27.563 --> 01:16:28.563
Yeah.

01:16:29.764 --> 01:16:33.267
So, Ed and Chris are
gonna save us some seats.

01:16:34.369 --> 01:16:36.203
How many should
we save for Lucy?

01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:37.471
I don't know.

01:16:37.473 --> 01:16:38.272
It's seven o'clock
and she's still not

01:16:38.274 --> 01:16:39.473
answering her phone.

01:16:39.475 --> 01:16:40.607
I mean, come on,
let's be honest here.

01:16:40.609 --> 01:16:41.675
I mean, the in the slight chance

01:16:41.677 --> 01:16:42.876
that she even tracked him down,

01:16:42.878 --> 01:16:45.412
what are the odds
that he even said yes?

01:16:45.414 --> 01:16:46.613
See, she came stag.
Oh!

01:16:46.615 --> 01:16:47.881
Okay, don't say anything.

01:16:47.883 --> 01:16:48.916
Just act like it's
completely normal.

01:16:48.918 --> 01:16:49.449
- Right, avoid tears.
- Yeah.

01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:50.484
Lucy!

01:16:50.486 --> 01:16:51.919
You look great.

01:16:51.921 --> 01:16:53.153
You look amazing,
your hair looks great.

01:16:53.155 --> 01:16:53.687
Your eye makeup looks fantastic.

01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:54.689
Mmhmm.

01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:56.790
I suppose you want
to know what happened.

01:16:56.792 --> 01:16:58.091
- No.
- Yes!

01:16:58.093 --> 01:16:59.026
Was it traumatic?

01:16:59.028 --> 01:16:59.960
Did you find him?

01:16:59.962 --> 01:17:00.761
Did you say anything to him?

01:17:00.763 --> 01:17:02.996
What did you say?

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:05.299
No, no, no, Lucy, don't cry.
No, no, no, shh, shh, shh.

01:17:05.301 --> 01:17:06.433
We're beyond tears here.

01:17:06.435 --> 01:17:07.835
We're beyond tears.
Yeah, be,

01:17:07.837 --> 01:17:09.303
be in control of the tears.

01:17:09.305 --> 01:17:10.571
Are you wearing
waterproof mascara?

01:17:10.573 --> 01:17:13.774
I ate a hotdog off
a street meat cart.

01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:15.442
No napkin.

01:17:15.444 --> 01:17:16.343
Luce, are you okay?

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:18.145
And then, I went home,

01:17:18.147 --> 01:17:20.647
and I shredded my
ice post-it notes.

01:17:20.649 --> 01:17:21.481
Ice?

01:17:21.483 --> 01:17:22.850
In case of emergency.

01:17:22.852 --> 01:17:23.984
Oh, dear god.

01:17:23.986 --> 01:17:24.985
And then...

01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:25.919
Mmhmm?

01:17:25.921 --> 01:17:27.154
- And then...
- There's more?

01:17:27.156 --> 01:17:29.256
I called the owner
from Betty vision,

01:17:29.258 --> 01:17:32.159
and I pitched myself to
take over the campaign.

01:17:32.161 --> 01:17:33.861
Ooh, what happened?

01:17:33.863 --> 01:17:35.996
We have a meeting on Monday.

01:17:35.998 --> 01:17:37.497
That's amazing!

01:17:37.499 --> 01:17:39.399
Okay, I am confused here.

01:17:39.401 --> 01:17:40.701
What happened to Graham?

01:17:40.703 --> 01:17:42.970
- Oh.
- Did he say yes or no?

01:17:42.972 --> 01:17:44.071
He said...

01:17:44.073 --> 01:17:45.305
He said yes.

01:17:49.478 --> 01:17:51.645
You didn't wait for me to
give you an answer, but,

01:17:51.647 --> 01:17:52.647
I said yes.

01:17:54.549 --> 01:17:56.216
What about your girlfriend?

01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:57.351
Oh no, we broke up.

01:17:57.353 --> 01:17:59.419
She was collecting her things.

01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:01.021
So, uh...

01:18:01.023 --> 01:18:01.855
You're single?

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:02.689
I'm single.

01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:03.523
Me too.

01:18:03.525 --> 01:18:04.525
I figured.

01:18:06.262 --> 01:18:08.562
It's an 80s-themed prom wedding,

01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:10.631
so I still had it in my
closet, short notice.

01:18:10.633 --> 01:18:13.233
You gonna stand outside my
window blasting that thing?

01:18:13.235 --> 01:18:14.067
Yeah.

01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:15.069
Stand here, yeah.

01:18:16.138 --> 01:18:17.337
I figured maybe I should
buy you a drink first,

01:18:17.339 --> 01:18:18.705
seeing as it's a
first date and all.

01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:19.539
Okay.

01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:21.508
And what'll it be?

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.277
What about a Pinot Grigio?

01:18:23.279 --> 01:18:25.746
Let's make it two.

01:18:25.748 --> 01:18:27.247
This is for you.

01:18:40.561 --> 01:18:42.397
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:43.364 --> 01:18:44.364
Cheers.

01:18:45.868 --> 01:18:47.901
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats

01:18:47.903 --> 01:18:50.804
as the ceremony starring
your prom royalty

01:18:50.806 --> 01:18:53.640
will start in just
a few moments.

01:18:54.742 --> 01:18:56.243
Guess we should take our seats.

01:18:56.245 --> 01:18:58.278
Guess we should.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.547
Let's go, lovers!

01:19:00.549 --> 01:19:01.549
Hey...

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:05.852
I'm glad you asked me to come.

01:19:05.854 --> 01:19:08.322
'Cause that thing you felt...

01:19:08.324 --> 01:19:10.023
Yeah, I felt it too.

01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:24.171
I wanted to do that
since I met you.

01:19:32.246 --> 01:19:33.246
Oh...

01:19:34.449 --> 01:19:37.150
I've been wanting to do
that since I met you.

01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:38.185
Okay then.

01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:43.223
Let's get drunk.

01:19:43.225 --> 01:19:44.225
Yeah.

01:19:52.367 --> 01:19:53.900
He kissed me.

01:19:53.902 --> 01:19:55.035
I kissed him.

01:19:56.371 --> 01:19:57.204
Nectar?

01:19:57.206 --> 01:19:58.338
Hi!

01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.873
You guys know each other?

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:01.475
You know, it's,
it's a really long story.

01:20:01.477 --> 01:20:03.343
Yup, it's a long story.

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:05.112
Man, I wouldn't.

01:20:06.382 --> 01:20:07.681
She's gay!

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:08.949
What?

01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:10.517
Holy shitballs!

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:13.553
She just gets cooler and cooler.

01:20:13.555 --> 01:20:14.921
To Denise Masterson.

01:20:14.923 --> 01:20:16.656
To Denise Masterson.
