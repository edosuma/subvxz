00:49.675 --> 00:51.176
<i>How did it all start?</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:55.722
<i>I mean,
my girls inspired the first Beanies.</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:08.652
<i>I was employee number 12.</i>

01:09.987 --> 01:14.449
<i>Three years later, we were the most
profitable toy company in the world.</i>

01:24.668 --> 01:28.505
<i>Ty would tell you
he did it all, but that's bullshit.</i>

01:29.882 --> 01:32.009
<i>We built that company together.</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:34.178
<i>From nothing.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:42.352
<i>I mean, that's the whole point of America,
right?</i>

01:44.396 --> 01:48.066
<i>Work hard. Build something good.</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:53.947
<i>Get yourself in the right place
at the right time, and boom.</i>

03:45.350 --> 03:48.145
<i>We didn't set out
to make America lose its mind,</i>

03:49.897 --> 03:51.190
<i>but that's what happened.</i>

03:55.903 --> 03:58.780
<i>Was it crazy
to turn stuffed animals into investments?</i>

04:07.706 --> 04:09.291
<i>It was a crazy time.</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:15.506
<i>The Internet was new.
The Boomers were taking over.</i>

04:15.506 --> 04:20.344
<i>But we turned Beanie Babies
into little plush lotto tickets.</i>

04:21.845 --> 04:25.098
<i>At the peak of the bubble,
more than half the country owned one.</i>

04:25.933 --> 04:30.562
<i>Ty was the one with his name on the tag.
The one who made billions.</i>

04:31.355 --> 04:33.649
<i>But he couldn't have done it
without the three of us.</i>

04:34.399 --> 04:37.778
- <i>He didn't do it without the three of us.</i>
- Ty!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.696
<i>So this story's not about him.</i>

04:40.197 --> 04:41.823
<i>It's about us.</i>

04:57.464 --> 04:58.799
<i>I met Ty back in the '80s</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:01.093
<i>when we were living
in the same apartment building.</i>

05:05.472 --> 05:07.140
Oh, God, not my husband!

05:07.140 --> 05:10.060
- Ma'am, I need you to just back up, okay?
- Oh, my God. Is this Billy?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.813
<i>When his dad died.</i>

05:17.192 --> 05:18.318
Oh, shit.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.451
Billy,

05:28.287 --> 05:29.663
did you take your meds?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.458
Did you take your meds today?

05:33.959 --> 05:34.960
Yeah.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.629
Did you pick up more Tab?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.841
Yeah.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.453
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.749
I baked this.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.918
- Here, I'll just put it down for you.
- Yeah. Okay.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.295
Yeah, it's a lasagna. Maybe just here?

06:22.424 --> 06:23.425
I'm not psycho.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.555
I dissect them
to see how they're made for work.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.476
Not for fun.
But to be honest, it is pretty fun.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.102
Right.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.773
My dad would say,
"You gotta make your own luck.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.528
You can't wait for your ship to come in,
Son. You gotta build your own ship."

06:42.528 --> 06:44.154
That's what he would say.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.867
- Have you told your mom yet?
- Oh, God, no.

06:48.867 --> 06:53.205
She is a violent paranoid schizophrenic
who abandoned us years ago.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.667
Where was your dad for all this?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.669
On the road, selling toys.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.796
Oh, man.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.257
It's okay. Was better that way.

07:03.799 --> 07:06.635
Otherwise he would be at home,
beating the crap out of me.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.137
Wait. I--

07:11.056 --> 07:13.308
- I thought you two were so close.
- No.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.813
The only time my dad was proud of me

07:18.647 --> 07:22.860
is when our girlfriend told him
how good I was in bed.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.615
- "Our girlfriend."
- Yeah, the same woman.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.617
- You dated the same woman?
- No.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.952
- At the same time?
- No, not--

07:31.952 --> 07:35.998
- No, not always at the same time, no.
- Okay.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.333
We're gonna need another.

07:38.333 --> 07:43.255
I do and do not want to know
much, much more.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.931
<i>My story started ten years later,</i>

07:53.432 --> 07:56.185
<i>when I first
walked into the offices of Ty Inc.</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:04.151
<i>I was a 17-year-old college
freshman just trying to land a temp job.</i>

08:05.027 --> 08:07.571
<i>Not usher in a new era of capitalism.</i>

08:09.323 --> 08:12.284
You'd be expected to brush
and tweeze the display cats.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.123
- Oh, wow. You're serious.
- Yeah.

08:18.123 --> 08:22.377
But the job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day, plus some Saturdays.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.129
You said you're in school?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.924
- Yeah, I'm in school--
- <i>Roberta, sweetie,</i>

08:26.924 --> 08:29.760
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

08:30.260 --> 08:33.347
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

08:35.974 --> 08:36.975
Bye.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.898
Yeah, I'm in school,
but the schedule's not a problem.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.650
I just need money.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.736
Tuition's tough these days, huh?

08:47.736 --> 08:50.239
I've got a scholarship. It's for rent.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.825
If I keep living at home,
my soul will soon be fully crushed.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.746
We pay minimum wage.
Not sure that's a salvation salary.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.414
You don't know how cheap my soul is.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.627
We do what we gotta do, right?

09:04.545 --> 09:06.129
This just pays my bungee bills.

09:06.129 --> 09:10.133
Oh, Robbie, I need you. Robbie?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.427
Rose, which color is better?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.680
- Don't know, don't care.
- What about you? What do you think?

09:15.264 --> 09:16.974
I'm not really a cat person.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.142
Are you an amazing things person?

09:21.770 --> 09:24.773
Yeah, I wouldn't go yellow at all.
Too mild.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.442
These little punks wanna be tiger-striped.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.946
But wouldn't stripes make them
too convict-y?

09:30.946 --> 09:34.408
Well, cats are outlaws.
Convict-y is kinda their appeal.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.492
Yes.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.538
Rose, she has a good point. What--

09:40.622 --> 09:42.416
Rose, what are you looking at?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.128
<i>We'll get to that later.</i>

09:46.128 --> 09:47.880
Don't go anywhere.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.718
Does that mean I'm hired?

09:52.718 --> 09:53.886
<i>It did.</i>

09:53.886 --> 09:57.097
<i>But obviously none of this
would have happened without Sheila.</i>

10:01.768 --> 10:05.189
<i>Mr. President and Mrs. Clinton,</i>

10:05.189 --> 10:07.983
<i>and Americans everywhere.</i>

10:08.609 --> 10:13.530
<i>A Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts...</i>

10:13.530 --> 10:16.867
<i>It certainly wasn't my dream
designing lights for people like Ty.</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:20.829
<i>I did it to pay the bills,
to support my girls.</i>

10:23.457 --> 10:26.502
Well, I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.963
Honestly, if I were you, I'd just bail.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.510
<i>I wanted the world to be better for them.</i>

10:35.093 --> 10:39.556
<i>I wanted it to get kinder and happier
and more human.</i>

10:41.350 --> 10:42.726
<i>I wanted it to hurry up.</i>

10:52.486 --> 10:54.821
Lights, right? I'll be right with ya.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.825
<i>The UK is a mess, and it's not my fault.</i>

10:58.825 --> 11:01.620
And the last thing I would do
is to hire incompetent partners--

11:03.789 --> 11:05.207
Excuse me, what are you doing?

11:05.207 --> 11:07.125
Do you often keep people waiting
three hours?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.585
It has been a hectic--

11:08.585 --> 11:11.129
'Cause I told my sick daughters
I'd be back as quick as I could,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.214
and then I waited here

11:12.214 --> 11:14.091
- for longer than a human should--
- I run a company

11:14.091 --> 11:16.635
- that's highly unpredictable--
- Okay. I know you're busy.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.136
And I know you're rich.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.014
But I also know that life is too short
to waste on assholes,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.017
so please move your car,
or I'll move it for you less gently.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.435
I got better places to be.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.689
Wow.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.400
May I come?

11:32.484 --> 11:33.902
I am not joking.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.115
I am so sorry. Let me make it up to you.
Let me take you to dinner.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.284
No. I only eat dinner with my daughters.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.662
Well, I'll take all of you.
It'll be fun. Kids love me.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.416
Look, this isn't personal. I--

11:48.000 --> 11:49.751
Despite what I said
about you being an asshole--

11:49.751 --> 11:53.297
Assholes used to be my type.
I just-- I don't date anymore.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.174
Anyone? Ever?

11:55.841 --> 11:58.302
No. Not till my girls grow up.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.804
Goodbye.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.431
Okay.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.059
- Your loss.
- Okay.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.562
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.110
Mommy, when is it gonna warm up?

12:15.819 --> 12:18.739
That is a great question. You know what?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.494
Soon.

12:24.995 --> 12:25.996
And if it doesn't,

12:25.996 --> 12:29.082
we're gonna go to Uncle Jeremy's,
stay the night there.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.043
He's not really our uncle.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.838
No, but he really is a Jeremy. I think.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.759
- We got it!
- Hang on, girls.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.846
- Are you Sheila Harper's daughters?
- Yeah. Who's asking?

12:42.846 --> 12:45.724
This is from Mr. Ty Warner.
He hopes that they're feeling better.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.643
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:47.643 --> 12:48.936
- Thanks!
- Hang on.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.605
- What is it?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.981
Let's get the door.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.859
All right. Hang on, hang on.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.695
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh!

12:58.695 --> 12:59.821
Oh, my God.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.241
<i>Ty was good at knowing what people wanted.</i>

13:02.241 --> 13:04.076
Wow, look at all of this.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.090
<i>First,
I wanted to be a wide receiver in the NFL.</i>

13:19.299 --> 13:23.345
Then I wanted to star in air shows.
I stole a crop plane to practice.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.307
Then I wanted to beat up Sam Walton.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.684
The Walmart guy?

13:28.684 --> 13:32.187
Walmart puts family stores
out of business.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.481
- Well, I think you could take him.
- Duh.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.443
Damn it,
I had so many plans back in Arkansas.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.072
Life was gonna be so fun
if I just got out into it.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.741
Like, I left--

13:44.741 --> 13:47.911
I left so that I wouldn't get stuck
taking care of people.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.540
I wanted to live my life for me.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.503
And here I am. This tub.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.505
Look at this.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.426
- It's like I'm my mother.
- Dad was hiding the good stuff.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.136
I like good stuff.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.222
- Scotch. Yeah.
- Me. Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.226
So graceful.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.481
We should be synchronized swimmers!

14:16.481 --> 14:17.858
- From now on.
- Robbie, Robbie.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.443
Listen to me.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.945
You can do anything you want.
You're not stuck.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.156
You're tough, and you're strong.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.659
Let's start our own business, you and me.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.288
A synchronized swimming business?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.418
A stuffed Himalayan cat business.

14:39.254 --> 14:44.009
A synchronized stuffed Himalayan
swimming business?

14:44.009 --> 14:46.053
- I'm serious. Well--
- Robbie!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.182
- Robbie, is that you?
- No!

15:08.116 --> 15:09.117
What?

15:10.619 --> 15:12.120
How are you even walking?

15:13.205 --> 15:19.878
I sold all my dad's antiques
so we could start

15:19.878 --> 15:23.298
our own business together.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.386
The swimming thing?

15:28.262 --> 15:31.431
The cats. Yeah, the stuffed cats.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.933
Don't you understand? This is happening.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.936
This is the first day of
the rest of your life, young lady.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.688
Could you just take it down a little bit?

15:37.688 --> 15:40.065
This is the first day of
the rest of your life.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.738
Here we are.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.659
- Okay. For you.
- Wow.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.786
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.707
For you. It's hot. Hot, hot.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.501
And I like mine cold.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.670
You know,
we were supposed to be treating you.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.589
Mr. Warner, this is very kind.

16:03.589 --> 16:07.342
Please, it's Ty. Mr. Warner was my dad.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.178
And his stuffed animals
weren't as cool as mine.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.387
Yours are so cool.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.223
Yours are the bestest best.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.184
Thank you very much.
Do you have a favorite?

16:15.184 --> 16:16.268
The pig.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.394
And the frog.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.396
I tried to bring it to school
for show-and-tell,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.148
but it wouldn't fit in my backpack.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.232
Oh, no.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.903
Well, I'm gonna have to
make a smaller one then.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.989
And maybe a little softer too.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.992
- Okay, let's stick to the thank-yous.
- Softer. Okay.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.410
- Hey, Ty?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.205
Do you wanna go roller-skating
with us sometime?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.208
- I would love to.
- Honey, no. Okay.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.043
- I would love to.
- Can we, Mommy? Soon?

16:41.043 --> 16:42.794
Okay-- Well, I mean, Ty's a busy man,

16:42.794 --> 16:46.256
- so I don't know when he would find time.
- Listen, let's--

16:46.256 --> 16:48.800
- let's keep your mom out of this, okay?
- Okay.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.136
I'll have my people contact your people.
How's that?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.232
Ben, 9 and 11.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.652
- Thank you.
- Your left hands.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.238
- I declare a thumb war.
- Ladies.

17:09.238 --> 17:11.114
- Hi.
- Hey. There you are.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.199
- Hi.
- Hi, Ty.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.577
I have been looking forward to this
all week.

17:15.577 --> 17:20.790
And I brought a surprise.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.377
- Oh, my God. Froggy!
- It's a Beanie Baby.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.212
That's a miniature version
of your favorite.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.673
- I know.
- He's small enough to go everywhere,

17:27.673 --> 17:30.050
and he loves to ride in backpacks.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.845
Wow, then you can take him to school.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.096
What's his name?

17:34.096 --> 17:36.473
I don't know yet.
What does he look like to you?

17:38.308 --> 17:40.561
Can I take a closer look at him?

17:40.561 --> 17:42.646
What do you think he looks like?

17:42.646 --> 17:45.274
- Greenie.
- Greenie.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.192
Kids' 11 and 13, Sheila.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.152
- Yeah. That's us.
- Can you give us a minute?

17:49.152 --> 17:50.320
We're working here.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.322
All right.

17:53.657 --> 17:58.078
Why don't we name him Mar?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.330
- Mar?
- Yeah.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.794
I mean, Leaper's a great name.
I'm just not sold on it yet, but it's--

18:05.794 --> 18:07.337
What about Sir Jumps-a-Lot?

18:08.005 --> 18:09.089
That's a good one.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.717
Or maybe, like, Jumpy?

18:12.301 --> 18:13.760
- That's too on the nose, Jumpy.
- Jumpy.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.972
I dance with my arms.
I dance with my head.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.892
I dance with my butt.
I dance with my belly.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.769
I dance with my legs.
I dance with my arms.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.271
I dance with my belly.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.940
- Well, that's it.
- What?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.275
- Legs.
- What?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.568
Legs.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.652
- The name?
- What?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.404
- That's great. Legs.
- That's the name.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.490
- Legs the frog. I named it!
- Legs!

18:35.490 --> 18:37.826
- We have a name.
- Good work, ladies. Great.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.077
And I think

18:39.077 --> 18:42.414
- Legs has a friend.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.166
We'll go roller-skating eventually.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.085
No, I think we're having a great time.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.048
Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.382
<i>Within a few months,</i>

18:52.382 --> 18:56.345
<i>Ty was completely obsessed
with his new Beanie Baby line.</i>

18:56.345 --> 18:58.430
<i>And working there was actually fun...</i>

18:58.430 --> 18:59.348
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:59.348 --> 19:02.142
<i>...'cause if he liked the way you think,
he'd listen to you.</i>

19:02.142 --> 19:03.685
- Hey.
- <i>No matter who you were.</i>

19:04.561 --> 19:06.605
<i>Case in point: his design team.</i>

19:07.314 --> 19:09.483
Hey, Ty. Like my ghost?

19:09.483 --> 19:11.693
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.366
- First batch of puppies is here.
- Yeah.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.703
- Look at them.
- Cute.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.497
So cute! The face.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.207
Let them hug. Let's hug.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.084
I see you named him Dots.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.336
Oh, yeah. After much deliberation.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.838
Well, I dig it.

19:30.838 --> 19:33.507
It's just-- Don't you think
he should actually have some dots?

19:33.507 --> 19:34.675
It's a she.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.426
I'm sorry.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.346
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

19:39.346 --> 19:43.058
Well, you know what?
She definitely should have some dots.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.726
Maya's right, as usual.

19:45.435 --> 19:50.148
All right, ladies. For the next batch,
where should we put Dots's dots?

19:50.148 --> 19:51.233
On her butt!

19:51.233 --> 19:52.317
On the butt?

19:53.402 --> 19:55.654
- How many dots on the butt?
- A million.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.781
- A million dots?
- A million dots.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.498
<i>When Ty's Beanie Babies
were ready for their world debut,</i>

20:06.498 --> 20:09.084
<i>he put me in charge of
smaller trade shows.</i>

20:10.794 --> 20:12.379
<i>'Cause I rocked at selling stuff.</i>

20:15.215 --> 20:17.009
<i>I killed it.</i>

20:17.009 --> 20:19.428
<i>- I raked in the orders.</i>
- So soft.

20:19.428 --> 20:22.431
<i>For everything except Beanies.</i>

20:23.640 --> 20:26.643
<i>Their big launch was a total flop.</i>

20:26.643 --> 20:28.937
<i>For two years,
we couldn't sell any at all.</i>

20:29.438 --> 20:31.106
<i>It drove Ty crazy.</i>

20:31.982 --> 20:33.442
What is this, a comic book stand?

20:33.442 --> 20:36.111
No, Ty Inc. is all about
high-quality stuffed animals.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.738
None of them are looking at me.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.947
What?

20:38.947 --> 20:42.242
These animals are supposed to be
making tantalizing eye contact with me.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.912
They're supposed to be alluringly tweezed.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.622
Yeah, you should go blond more often, Ty.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.208
- It really brings out your cheekbones.
- I'm undercover.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.504
- Why aren't you wearing something sparkly?
- This is my version of sparkly.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.006
How are sales?

20:56.006 --> 20:58.592
Good. Well, except for Beanies.

20:58.592 --> 21:01.094
Though there have been
a lot of requests for Woolly.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.847
Maya,
if you can't sell what we actually have,

21:03.847 --> 21:07.768
I'm gonna have to find someone that can.
Someone a little bit more focused.

21:10.646 --> 21:14.399
Hi. I'd like my regular order,
plus a batch of those cheap little lambs.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.235
Do you still have those?

21:18.195 --> 21:21.823
That design has been retired.
That was a special limited edition.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.535
- A what?
- A limited edition.

21:24.535 --> 21:27.329
If you still have some,
they're pretty valuable.

21:27.329 --> 21:31.041
You know, the first issue of <i>Action Comics</i>
sells for over a million dollars.

21:32.918 --> 21:35.921
Are any of these others,
limited editions too?

21:35.921 --> 21:39.466
Yep. All the Beanie Babies are.
Be a good idea to stock up.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.885
Okay. Put me down for five of each.

21:41.885 --> 21:42.970
Frank Carlson.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.973
Uncle Frank's Toys in Glenview, I know.
I got you.

21:45.973 --> 21:47.057
Thank you.

21:51.061 --> 21:54.940
- "Retired." That's genius.
- Limited editions always get people.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.900
I love it. It's fantastic.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.819
Get this comic book off the table, please.

22:01.238 --> 22:04.825
So you're being an assistant
to some man selling worthless toys,

22:04.825 --> 22:06.994
instead of studying full-time
to be a surgeon?

22:06.994 --> 22:08.996
- Yep.
- Fascinating.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.289
After we sacrificed so much

22:10.289 --> 22:12.624
to come to a country
where women can do anything they want.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.544
Exactly.
Anything they want, not their parents.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.130
- And I'm still in school, don't freak.
- Do I look like a freaker?

22:18.130 --> 22:21.341
- I mean, you do kind of freak out--
- Not a word from you, mister.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.886
Okay, come on.
I don't have all day to help my daughter

22:23.886 --> 22:26.388
shatter her parents' hearts
into a thousand tiny pieces.

22:26.388 --> 22:31.393
- My new place is a mile away, Dad.
- 1,000 tiny, irreparable pieces.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.188
So dramatic.

22:38.734 --> 22:42.362
You wanna sell
high-end stuffed Himalayan cats?

22:42.362 --> 22:45.032
Understuffed, actually.
For greater posability.

22:45.032 --> 22:48.076
It's a revolutionary new design
that's going to electrify the market.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.038
I assume you're aware
that the current economic conditions

22:51.038 --> 22:53.165
are crippling stagnation,

22:53.165 --> 22:56.126
<i>soaring inflation and record unemployment.</i>

22:56.126 --> 22:59.713
Which makes this the perfect time
to sell a little joy.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.675
We're professionals.
We're giving the people what they need.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.849
I'll draw up the paperwork.

23:14.228 --> 23:16.772
<i>And just like that, Ty Inc. was born.</i>

23:18.732 --> 23:20.067
- See here?
- Yeah.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.903
- The threading is not--
- Well, you can see it right there.

23:22.903 --> 23:25.405
Now, this is what we call the... stitch.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.783
<i>Ty taught me everything
about stuffed animals,</i>

23:27.783 --> 23:30.285
<i>which hadn't changed much in 50 years.</i>

23:30.869 --> 23:34.081
<i>They'd been made pretty firm,
stuffed to the seams.</i>

23:34.748 --> 23:38.126
<i>His big idea? Make 'em softer. Posable.</i>

23:38.126 --> 23:39.628
This is, like, a old lady and...

23:39.628 --> 23:42.381
<i>I was a fast learner.
And I had a thing or two to teach him.</i>

23:42.381 --> 23:43.924
- It's so boring.
- This one works.

23:43.924 --> 23:47.177
- Look at this. Look at this. That's it.
- Doesn't work.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.888
Open, open. Hurry. hurry.

23:50.556 --> 23:51.557
<i>We were a good team.</i>

23:51.557 --> 23:52.641
It's good.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.019
It's good! I love it!

23:56.019 --> 23:58.355
Robbie! Hey!

23:58.355 --> 24:00.524
<i>Turns out I was born for this shit.</i>

24:00.524 --> 24:01.942
Yeah, I hear you!

24:02.943 --> 24:04.695
Robbie! Hey, Robbie!

24:04.695 --> 24:06.655
J-- One sec!

24:06.655 --> 24:11.243
One. One each. Oh, my God. One.

24:12.828 --> 24:15.789
Who knew it only took
inventing a line of stuffed animals

24:15.789 --> 24:17.875
to break your strict dating embargo?

24:19.251 --> 24:22.171
- It took way more than that.
- Did it?

24:22.171 --> 24:25.382
Yeah.
And they're understuffed, by the way.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.218
One of his many innovations.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.389
You seem kinda happy.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.184
I don't know, Ty's different. He's--

24:36.518 --> 24:41.273
He's strange and magical,
and the girls, they love him.

24:41.273 --> 24:43.108
And you?

24:43.734 --> 24:45.194
They love me too.

24:48.572 --> 24:49.615
Wow.

24:49.615 --> 24:52.492
- Is that the one she designed?
- Yeah. I brought you one.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.579
- Here.
- Look at this.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.248
It's got her name in it.

24:59.249 --> 25:01.168
Look at his cute little dots!

25:01.168 --> 25:02.669
Oh, my goodness.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.714
- These are adorable.
- Our friend, Ty, makes them.

25:05.714 --> 25:06.798
I designed Spooky.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.091
Really?

25:08.091 --> 25:09.051
- Yeah.
- Wow.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.931
Little poems inside their tags.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.141
How darling.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.102
Girls.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.151
<i>Our little world
was getting better and happier.</i>

25:28.570 --> 25:31.198
<i>Before we knew it, we were a family.</i>

25:31.782 --> 25:35.202
<i>A funny, weird, happy family.</i>

25:41.959 --> 25:43.168
You a doctor yet?

25:44.294 --> 25:45.712
It's so boring.

25:46.213 --> 25:48.465
If it weren't for computer science,
I'd kill myself.

25:49.174 --> 25:52.594
Good news is, Stripes turned out great.
Wanna hear?

25:52.594 --> 25:53.929
Nope.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.139
<i>My name is Stripes
And I'm fun to snuggle</i>

25:56.139 --> 25:58.433
<i>I was born too soft
For the jungle struggle</i>

25:58.433 --> 26:01.144
<i>So, I packed my bags, waved goodbye</i>

26:01.144 --> 26:03.480
<i>And came to live with my friends at Ty</i>

26:03.480 --> 26:07.442
I still can't believe
Ty let you print raps on their tags.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.486
Poems, Rose. This is poetry.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.571
Uh-huh.

26:11.572 --> 26:14.283
Stripes has a birthday coming up.
Should we blow it out?

26:14.283 --> 26:18.328
You're doing something right.
Regional Beanie sales are way up.

26:18.996 --> 26:19.997
For real?

26:22.833 --> 26:23.876
No "piggity"?

26:24.918 --> 26:28.088
If you start with puns,
I might actually have to punch you.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.340
All right.

26:31.550 --> 26:32.551
My bat.

26:34.261 --> 26:35.762
- Bird up!
- Okay.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.390
No, come on. I'm just kitten around.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.474
All right.

26:40.601 --> 26:41.685
Watch out.

26:42.311 --> 26:43.604
What the fox?

26:46.607 --> 26:48.442
Hey. This is unbearable.

26:52.988 --> 26:55.866
<i>The local surge had started
in a small suburban neighborhood</i>

26:55.866 --> 26:58.785
<i>outside of Chicago,
just after the holidays.</i>

27:00.746 --> 27:04.166
<i>Some kids who'd gotten Beanies brought
them to school and showed them off.</i>

27:05.167 --> 27:08.337
<i>It wasn't long before
some parents got pretty into them too.</i>

27:09.755 --> 27:11.632
<i>Three of them
lived on the same cul-de-sac.</i>

27:11.632 --> 27:13.509
<i>Two were named Linda.</i>

27:14.009 --> 27:17.137
<i>All of them started Beanie hunting
at the local toy store.</i>

27:18.972 --> 27:22.267
<i>Frank even published a checklist,
which brought out the crazy.</i>

27:23.435 --> 27:26.438
<i>'Cause once you have a checklist,
it's no longer about what you have.</i>

27:27.481 --> 27:29.316
<i>It's all about what you don't have.</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:37.491
<i>Initially, the regional boom
was all word of mouth,</i>

27:38.492 --> 27:40.827
<i>'cause Ty didn't buy TV ads.</i>

27:40.827 --> 27:44.164
<i>But word of mouth was about to get
a hell of a megaphone.</i>

27:45.165 --> 27:48.168
In summary,
the Midwest market is going bananas.

27:51.672 --> 27:52.673
Hey.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.424
Bravo. Exciting.

27:54.424 --> 27:55.801
- Exciting, right?
- Yes.

27:55.801 --> 27:58.846
Hey, did you get a chance to check out
that modem I left for you yet?

27:58.846 --> 28:00.180
- The what-em?
- Modem.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.559
That little computer box I put in your
office that connects you to the Internet?

28:04.309 --> 28:06.603
All of these messages
are about Beanie Babies?

28:06.603 --> 28:08.814
This whole section is Beanie Baby boards.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.983
Everyone writing on here
is writing about them.

28:13.277 --> 28:14.862
But how do they all know each other?

28:16.113 --> 28:19.616
Well, they don't.
It's kinda like a big conference call.

28:20.158 --> 28:22.494
We're dialed into this thing
called America Online,

28:22.494 --> 28:24.037
and so is everyone else here.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.039
Can we go back to the chat pad thing?

28:26.039 --> 28:27.124
Chat room.

28:27.124 --> 28:28.208
Okay.

28:40.429 --> 28:42.222
- It's so fast.
- Right?

28:43.015 --> 28:45.767
- Look at that. There's new thingies.
- Yeah. All the time.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.729
We're just watching Beanie lovers
hang out in real time.

28:50.022 --> 28:52.941
Even if they're in different
cities, time zones. Wherever.

28:52.941 --> 28:55.527
How many people
are into this sort of thing overall?

28:55.527 --> 28:59.323
My professor says 18 million homes
now have modem-equipped computers,

28:59.323 --> 29:01.033
- up from 11 million a year ago...
- What?

29:01.033 --> 29:02.993
...and that number's gonna keep growing.

29:02.993 --> 29:05.621
Wow, 18 million people
just talking about Beanie Babies.

29:06.205 --> 29:08.040
Well, and other things.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.585
I mean, the Internet's a whole new way of
connecting to the rest of the world.

29:11.585 --> 29:12.669
It's amazing.

29:13.879 --> 29:15.589
We really should start a Ty web page.

29:16.173 --> 29:17.174
What's that?

29:17.174 --> 29:18.258
We can make a place

29:18.258 --> 29:21.678
that anyone who wants to know
anything about Beanie Babies can go to.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.597
A place we control.

29:25.307 --> 29:26.141
Completely?

29:26.141 --> 29:29.269
And we'd probably be the first business
to make one for our customers,

29:29.269 --> 29:31.104
'cause no one else is using it that way.

29:31.104 --> 29:35.067
Most web pages are just boring academic
stuff and phone directories,

29:35.067 --> 29:36.735
but we could make ours fun.

29:37.236 --> 29:39.696
Different. Sparkly.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.032
Sparkly, I like that.

29:43.158 --> 29:46.203
- Wait. Your version of sparkly or mine?
- Yours.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.626
Are these toy shindigs fancy?

29:52.626 --> 29:57.089
Ty says we have to put on a show
and "pack something flashy," so...

29:58.799 --> 30:02.636
Is he gonna wear a dress also or does
he not do that sort of thing in public?

30:02.636 --> 30:04.429
He is not a cross-dresser.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.891
Yeah, well, he is the kinda guy
who's hiding who he really is.

30:07.891 --> 30:10.686
Ty had a rough life too, you know,
but he's going after things.

30:10.686 --> 30:13.397
He's making things happen,
getting what he deserves.

30:13.397 --> 30:16.567
- It's inspiring.
- Uh-huh.

30:17.150 --> 30:22.072
For once, I feel like I'm being
pulled up, not just dragged down.

30:22.573 --> 30:23.907
It's a fucking miracle.

30:27.452 --> 30:30.414
- I didn't mean-- I meant work stuff.
- It's fine. It's fine.

30:30.414 --> 30:31.999
You're allowed to go have fun.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.716
It's nice feeling
like someone believes in me.

30:42.968 --> 30:43.969
That's all I meant.

30:45.053 --> 30:47.723
Well, you'll have to tell me
what that feels like.

30:51.393 --> 30:54.188
I made you a lasagna,
and there's pizza too.

30:54.188 --> 30:56.690
And I'll only be gone for two days. Okay?

30:57.191 --> 30:59.151
- Make it longer.
- You know what, Billy?

30:59.151 --> 31:01.695
- I'm fucking trying to do s--
- No. I'm serious, okay?

31:01.695 --> 31:04.239
Let's stop fucking pretending.
I'm sick of it.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.618
You're not the only one
who's feeling fucking suffocated.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.508
- Checking in?
- Yes. Roberta Jones.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.676
- I'm-- The toy convention?
- Welcome.

31:28.889 --> 31:30.432
Here's your keys.

31:30.432 --> 31:31.892
And Mr. Warner left you a note.

31:31.892 --> 31:35.395
He said to tell you he's "fetching
a chariot to collect you at 3:00."

31:35.979 --> 31:37.022
And he left you this.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.490
Give them a look and give them a try.

32:28.490 --> 32:31.076
There you go. What do you think? Not bad?

32:31.076 --> 32:33.287
- Let me grab that from you.
- Not bad.

32:33.287 --> 32:34.746
That's great.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.291
- This is not your dad's stuffed animal.
- Enjoy your day.

32:37.791 --> 32:41.253
Fifty-two poses for the head alone.

32:46.967 --> 32:50.304
Thirty fucking thousand dollars!

32:52.681 --> 32:55.225
In an hour! For stuffed cats!

32:55.225 --> 32:58.395
We are great together,
just like I said we would be.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.731
- Fucking great.
- Ship-building champs, we are!

33:01.315 --> 33:03.692
Motherfucking Vikings!

33:04.193 --> 33:05.194
Hotel, please.

33:07.154 --> 33:09.448
You're one in a million, Robbie Jones.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.491
You are.

33:54.743 --> 33:55.744
Oh, God.

34:05.838 --> 34:07.798
Do you know what the greatest thing
about America is?

34:07.798 --> 34:10.050
- Toys!
- Milkshakes!

34:10.050 --> 34:13.679
Well, that's number-- Yes.
Number seven and 14, of course.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.473
But the number one
greatest thing about America?

34:16.473 --> 34:21.103
It's the land of comebacks,
of new chances, of opportunity.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.065
You can make things happen here
like nowhere else, ladies.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.775
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

34:26.775 --> 34:32.447
And never forget that you
have the power to create your own future.

34:33.282 --> 34:35.742
Never forget that you can be anything,

34:35.742 --> 34:38.579
- you can do anything.
- I'm gonna be a unicorn!

34:38.579 --> 34:41.164
You already are, darling. You already are.

34:41.164 --> 34:46.210
The past few years have been
just the greatest ever.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.257
I think we make an unbeatable team.
I think we do.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.800
- We make an unbeatable team.
- Yeah.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.844
- Me too.
- Me three.

34:53.844 --> 34:54.928
Me four.

34:55.888 --> 34:59.725
And I think some really amazing things...
You ready?

35:01.268 --> 35:03.812
I think some amazing things
are getting ready to happen.

35:04.313 --> 35:05.689
Can we do it now?

35:06.607 --> 35:07.608
Ladies.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.195
What is happening?

35:11.945 --> 35:16.241
<i>Oh, oh</i>

35:16.241 --> 35:17.326
What?

35:19.328 --> 35:22.456
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

35:22.456 --> 35:24.750
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes</i>

35:25.667 --> 35:26.668
Oh, my--

35:26.668 --> 35:30.005
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

35:30.005 --> 35:32.716
<i>You know I want to be the only one</i>

35:34.134 --> 35:37.346
<i>Oh, baby, love me right</i>

35:37.346 --> 35:39.640
<i>Let me love you till we get it right</i>

35:42.392 --> 35:44.978
<i>Why can't you let the others be?</i>

35:44.978 --> 35:48.899
<i>'Cause with you is where I wanna be Yeah</i>

35:48.899 --> 35:52.110
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

35:52.110 --> 35:55.906
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh, Sheila</i>

35:56.532 --> 35:59.535
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

35:59.535 --> 36:03.288
<i>You know I want to be the only one
Oh, Sheila</i>

36:03.288 --> 36:05.415
- <i>Here we go</i>
- Oh, my God.

36:06.250 --> 36:10.045
Sheila Marie Harper,
will you make me the happiest man alive?

36:10.712 --> 36:12.881
Say yes!

36:12.881 --> 36:15.634
Yes. Of course.

36:15.634 --> 36:16.802
Mommy!

36:18.053 --> 36:19.805
She said yes!

36:19.805 --> 36:20.889
Yay!

36:32.776 --> 36:37.406
You know, I thought it was just gonna be
me and the girls till they left home.

36:38.824 --> 36:40.784
Man, did you screw with my plans.

36:42.828 --> 36:46.039
Well, get ready for me to screw
with your plans for the rest of our lives.

36:50.085 --> 36:53.714
You know, this is serious,
what we're doing.

36:57.885 --> 37:00.137
- You're not reconsidering, are you?
- No.

37:01.305 --> 37:03.015
No. No, sweetheart.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.726
I just--

37:08.770 --> 37:12.316
In the past, I have relied on men,

37:13.233 --> 37:15.277
and they turned out to be the wrong men.

37:19.031 --> 37:20.657
I would die before I let you down.

37:28.916 --> 37:32.252
You know, I don't need this.

37:32.252 --> 37:35.172
I don't need to get married.

37:36.590 --> 37:37.591
Well, I do.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.432
- You feel that, right?
- Yeah.

37:45.432 --> 37:49.895
Your face-lift scar
from just before we met.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.356
'Cause I was ready for a fresh start.

37:52.356 --> 37:53.565
Wow.

37:54.066 --> 37:57.778
You know, I never knew
that plastic surgery could be so romantic.

38:00.948 --> 38:04.952
My life had gone bad...

38:08.580 --> 38:09.581
before you.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.502
And now it is more wonderful than ever.

38:15.462 --> 38:20.676
And I cannot wait
until you become Mrs. Warner.

38:21.677 --> 38:24.388
Mrs. H. Ty Warner.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.224
You know that I'm keeping
my own name though, right?

38:28.725 --> 38:29.768
Right.

38:31.019 --> 38:34.231
Well, whoever you are,
whatever your name is,

38:34.731 --> 38:37.025
we should get married
and grow old together.

38:40.571 --> 38:41.613
Deal.

38:43.866 --> 38:44.950
<i>Kumar residence.</i>

38:44.950 --> 38:47.369
I was hoping you'd answer.
I've got exams all morning.

38:47.369 --> 38:48.996
Could you update the site at 11:00?

38:48.996 --> 38:51.582
Yeah, I could go to the library
in between my classes.

38:51.582 --> 38:52.875
<i>Awesome. Thanks.</i>

38:52.875 --> 38:54.168
I swapped Peanut in this morning.

38:54.168 --> 38:57.087
He needs to drop a hint about Digger
tunneling out of the Beanie nursery.

38:57.087 --> 38:58.922
The collectors are gonna go crazy.

38:59.673 --> 39:02.301
Hey, did you check out
that new auction website I told you about?

39:02.301 --> 39:05.762
No. Shit. I meant to. I'll do that today.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.639
- "ePort" or some shit?
- <i>eBay.</i>

39:07.639 --> 39:10.142
eBay. Right.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.311
Crap, I'm so late.

39:12.311 --> 39:14.313
- <i>Because of the Peanut crab?</i>
- Wha-- Mom?

39:14.313 --> 39:16.440
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.233
<i>Who are you shit-shit-shitting?</i>

39:18.233 --> 39:19.902
<i>There is no shit-shit-shitting
in this family.</i>

39:19.902 --> 39:21.653
Sorry, she must have
picked up the extension.

39:21.653 --> 39:24.448
<i>No shit, Sherlock.
Get to school, both of you.</i>

39:24.448 --> 39:25.908
Yes, ma'am.

40:09.159 --> 40:10.869
All right, gremlins, time-out!

40:11.620 --> 40:13.330
- Hey, Maya. Come on in.
- Hi.

40:15.082 --> 40:17.709
You know, you made Ty's year
with that new computer setup.

40:17.709 --> 40:20.629
He won't stop talking about his RAM.

40:21.129 --> 40:22.172
Sorry.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.632
He's just through here.

40:25.676 --> 40:28.595
Wow. So cute.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.806
We spotted an enemy!

40:30.806 --> 40:34.017
- Not so cute. Warmongers.
- Yes, yes, yes!

40:34.017 --> 40:35.686
- Hey. Look who's here.
- Hi.

40:36.979 --> 40:38.647
200 new thingies since noon.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.440
I've got something even more exciting
to show you.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.942
- Now you're trapped!
- Hey. Come on.

40:41.942 --> 40:43.318
- Rascals.
- Sorry.

40:43.318 --> 40:46.196
Okay, dazzle me.
Show me what couldn't wait till tomorrow.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.868
You are not gonna believe this.

40:51.869 --> 40:52.786
May I?

40:53.287 --> 40:54.288
I'm sorry.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.625
Okay.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.588
- Come on.
- One sec.

41:05.257 --> 41:06.258
Here.

41:10.429 --> 41:13.640
Why are there photos and prices
of retired Beanie Babies on here?

41:13.640 --> 41:16.560
- They can't sell these.
- No, these aren't retailers.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.686
They're customers,

41:17.686 --> 41:19.813
reselling what they've already
bought from us.

41:20.355 --> 41:23.025
It's an online auction site,
a genius idea.

41:23.025 --> 41:26.445
Anybody can sell anything they want,
but we're the biggest thing on it.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.863
By a lot. Look.

41:27.863 --> 41:32.534
Dotless Dots is listed at $55,
11 times retail.

41:32.534 --> 41:35.245
- Well, we should sue them then.
- Well-- No, we-- What?

41:35.245 --> 41:36.538
We should kiss them.

41:36.538 --> 41:38.665
Are you seeing what they're doing for us?

41:38.665 --> 41:41.502
Yes. They're making a huge profit
on my products.

41:41.502 --> 41:44.254
Infringing on my trademarked--

41:44.254 --> 41:46.965
- trademarked name.
- No, making everybody greedy

41:46.965 --> 41:48.425
for what we sell.

41:48.425 --> 41:51.720
Not just as toys, but as investments.
As money makers.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.723
I mean, we could not pay
for this kind of marketing.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.976
These photos are just awful.

41:58.477 --> 42:01.063
I mean, amateur camera angles,
abysmal eye con--

42:01.063 --> 42:02.940
Look at the eye contact. There's none.

42:02.940 --> 42:05.526
Zero. This is a disgrace.

42:05.526 --> 42:08.612
The disgrace that's gonna
multiply our sales by a zillion.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.033
Well, maybe we won't sue.

42:13.659 --> 42:15.744
Yeah. This is a big deal, Ty.

42:16.453 --> 42:17.538
We gotta play it right.

42:17.538 --> 42:21.041
Okay, listen though.
I'm way too busy to handle all this crap.

42:21.583 --> 42:23.293
You're gonna have to manage it, okay?

42:23.293 --> 42:25.087
- Yeah. Plan to.
- Okay.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.381
I'm deferring med school
to come on board full-time.

42:28.382 --> 42:29.466
You're still in school?

42:30.384 --> 42:33.387
You know I am.
My parents want me to be a doctor.

42:33.387 --> 42:36.431
Doctors are a dime a dozen.
You are special.

42:36.431 --> 42:38.475
You don't need degrees to succeed.

42:38.475 --> 42:40.894
Tell your folks
that all the greats quit school early.

42:40.894 --> 42:42.354
I quit my freshman year.

42:42.354 --> 42:45.524
Yeah. Like you said, all the greats.

42:45.524 --> 42:47.484
We're a great team, Maya Kumar.

42:48.527 --> 42:49.528
Yes, we are.

42:50.863 --> 42:55.284
We are a dream team, Robbie Jones. Unbeatable.

42:56.702 --> 42:57.995
It's the cats!

42:58.954 --> 43:02.332
Oh, God. Keep the fatties away.
We don't want fatties near the booth.

43:05.419 --> 43:06.587
Are you joking?

43:06.587 --> 43:08.297
No, they sweat on the fur.

43:09.256 --> 43:11.675
Everyone is talking up this booth.

43:12.676 --> 43:13.719
Can I help you?

43:14.219 --> 43:15.596
These are incredible.

43:15.596 --> 43:18.390
They're so lifelike, and they're soft.

43:18.390 --> 43:21.018
What a good idea,
under-stuffing them like this.

43:21.018 --> 43:23.729
Thank you.
Can I get an order started for you?

43:23.729 --> 43:25.022
- For sure.
- Great.

43:25.022 --> 43:27.399
- I'll take two dozen for my store.
- Wonderful.

43:27.399 --> 43:29.943
And a few for my kids.
They will just die for these.

43:44.208 --> 43:45.626
I love that.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.481
Oh, my God. I love this.

44:46.979 --> 44:49.898
<i>It's amazing how quick ten years can go.</i>

44:51.817 --> 44:55.529
<i>By '92, we'd built a six-million-dollar
business together from scratch,</i>

44:55.529 --> 44:56.822
<i>broken up five times,</i>

44:56.822 --> 44:59.408
<i>and felt like we were
just getting started.</i>

45:00.409 --> 45:02.327
You are one of a kind, Robbie Jones.

45:02.327 --> 45:04.454
- One of a kind.
- Back at ya, Ty.

45:05.205 --> 45:06.790
Though I can't believe you're
from Arkansas

45:06.790 --> 45:08.250
and you've never met Clinton.

45:09.251 --> 45:11.170
- Do you think he's gonna win?
- Yeah.

45:11.170 --> 45:13.797
- He's younger than I am.
- And taller.

45:15.716 --> 45:16.884
And he has a kid.

45:18.594 --> 45:21.805
Do you think we should have kids?

45:21.805 --> 45:23.390
You're probably too old though.

45:23.390 --> 45:25.225
We have a lot on our plate already,
don't you think?

45:25.225 --> 45:27.269
I mean, we're birthing an empire.

45:28.353 --> 45:33.692
Listen. I think that we should
expand internationally.

45:33.692 --> 45:35.319
- What? No. No.
- Yes.

45:35.319 --> 45:36.737
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

45:36.737 --> 45:39.865
The market is perfect
for us to move into the UK.

45:39.865 --> 45:41.950
- Plus, it'll stimulate domestic.
- I said no.

45:43.869 --> 45:46.580
The number one mistake
that people make is they get too greedy.

45:46.580 --> 45:48.498
They start expanding too fast.

45:49.166 --> 45:50.375
Plus, I'm loyal to America.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.920
Okay,
what does that have to do with anything?

45:52.920 --> 45:57.049
My products are made
by Americans for Americans, end of story.

45:57.799 --> 46:02.137
Our products are made
for Americans by Asians.

46:02.137 --> 46:04.848
Ty Inc.'s plush animals
are manufactured in China

46:04.848 --> 46:06.350
- and Korea, as you well know.
- Yeah.

46:06.350 --> 46:09.603
Paying us back for all the bills
America's paid for the entire world,

46:09.603 --> 46:10.729
and I think it's about time.

46:10.729 --> 46:12.523
If you want other countries to pay us,

46:12.523 --> 46:14.691
then we need to sell to them,
not buy from them.

46:14.691 --> 46:18.862
And I am proposing
that we figure out how to sell to Europe.

46:18.862 --> 46:20.864
Don't double-cross America, Robbie.

46:21.740 --> 46:23.325
- I'm being serious.
- Okay.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.077
- No, I am.
- I know. I hear.

46:26.286 --> 46:28.914
You just sit there looking pretty,
okay, Paul Revere?

46:28.914 --> 46:30.249
I'll be over here,

46:30.249 --> 46:32.584
running the actual real business,
like always.

46:40.133 --> 46:41.468
I take requests, you know.

46:43.887 --> 46:45.764
I wish we were doing this
at the new place,

46:45.764 --> 46:47.432
but it's still under construction.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.893
It's bigger than this place.
Gorgeous light.

46:49.893 --> 46:51.144
This is perfect.

46:52.271 --> 46:53.564
- So, when's the wedding?
- Very soon.

46:53.564 --> 46:55.315
- We're not sure.
- Soon though. Right?

46:55.315 --> 46:57.526
- But we just-- we don't know exactly when...
- Yeah, soon.

46:57.526 --> 46:59.152
- ...but soon.
- Very soon.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.821
Things have just gotten busy.

47:00.821 --> 47:03.240
Well, these little critters
surely have taken off.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.950
It must be so exciting for your family.

47:04.950 --> 47:08.370
Very. Yeah.
Well, we love doing it all together.

47:08.370 --> 47:09.830
- Don't we, girls?
- Yeah.

47:10.330 --> 47:12.374
Take one of me and Ava's ghost!

47:12.374 --> 47:15.294
Yes, ma'am. Look at that.

47:16.044 --> 47:18.255
- Can I get one of the entire family?
- Sure.

47:18.255 --> 47:20.174
- Okey dokey.
- Yeah.

47:20.174 --> 47:21.341
Come on up.

47:22.718 --> 47:23.886
Thank you.

47:23.886 --> 47:26.054
All right. Look at this.

47:27.556 --> 47:29.850
The girls are thrilled by the photo.

47:30.851 --> 47:33.687
Isn't it nice, what they said
about it being a family business?

47:35.480 --> 47:37.941
Yeah.
I mean, it's just a dumb magazine piece.

47:37.941 --> 47:39.109
But great, yeah.

47:41.153 --> 47:42.154
Yeah, but--

47:44.239 --> 47:46.909
You know,
it's gonna be really wonderful to get away

47:46.909 --> 47:49.453
and have some time to finally relax.
You know?

47:50.162 --> 47:53.665
I think when we get back,
I'm gonna get another face-lift.

47:56.043 --> 47:57.377
What? Why?

47:57.377 --> 48:01.840
Just to tighten things up.
We can get a family discount.

48:03.050 --> 48:05.427
You could get some work done
on your nose or something.

48:06.178 --> 48:08.430
- What's wrong with my nose?
- Nothing.

48:08.430 --> 48:11.183
It's just, you have this--
a little bump on it.

48:11.183 --> 48:12.476
Maren has one too.

48:12.476 --> 48:15.354
Maren is not getting a nose job.

48:15.354 --> 48:18.982
Of course not. She's a child.

48:20.067 --> 48:21.652
I mean-- But you're old enough.

48:24.279 --> 48:25.447
Are you serious with this?

48:28.700 --> 48:34.206
Sweetie.
Sweetie, you're beautiful. You are.

48:34.206 --> 48:35.832
It was just a thought.

48:35.832 --> 48:38.669
I like having the power
to be able to shape myself,

48:38.669 --> 48:40.420
and I thought you would too.

48:40.420 --> 48:42.339
We have a big year coming up,

48:42.840 --> 48:44.424
and as the saying goes,

48:44.424 --> 48:49.680
"Genius is 1% inspiration,
99% presentation."

48:50.305 --> 48:52.432
That's not how the saying goes.

48:53.517 --> 48:55.853
Okay. I-- Yeah, all-- Forget I brought--

48:56.395 --> 49:00.274
Forget I brought it up. It's just-- Yeah.

49:04.987 --> 49:07.281
Mom, I can't find my floaties!

49:09.533 --> 49:10.993
Yeah, I'm coming.

49:14.705 --> 49:16.373
<i>Are they honeymooning in Florida?</i>

49:16.373 --> 49:19.918
Just holiday vacationing.
He says he'll be tuning in tonight.

49:21.044 --> 49:25.799
T-minus eight hours till showtime.
Move her this way.

49:26.383 --> 49:27.593
Make her dance a little.

49:28.427 --> 49:30.929
Will a 40-minute Shockwave movie
even play online?

49:31.513 --> 49:33.390
'Cause I've only ever seen 30-second ones.

49:33.390 --> 49:34.850
Welcome to the future.

49:45.694 --> 49:47.863
<i>You've reached Maya.
Tell me something good.</i>

49:50.157 --> 49:53.952
<i>How about you tell us when
you decided not to go to medical school?</i>

49:53.952 --> 49:56.955
<i>Your life is your life,
but we could at least be informed</i>

49:56.955 --> 50:00.792
<i>all that money we carefully saved
for your education is ours again,</i>

50:00.792 --> 50:02.252
<i>to do what we want with.</i>

50:02.920 --> 50:05.047
<i>Maybe we'll do something risky
and impulsive.</i>

50:05.047 --> 50:07.591
<i>See? See what you're doing to us?
Okay. Think about it.</i>

50:08.842 --> 50:11.011
Hey! Hey! No, no, no, no!

50:11.011 --> 50:15.140
It's almost midnight,
and my Beanies movie's about to go live.

50:15.974 --> 50:17.726
Hey, do one of the raps!

50:18.310 --> 50:20.562
You mean the ones that boosted sales 40%?

50:20.562 --> 50:22.523
Yeah. Maybe later, maybe--

50:22.523 --> 50:24.274
Okay, here we go.

50:24.274 --> 50:29.488
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

50:29.488 --> 50:31.532
three, two, one.

50:36.286 --> 50:38.539
- Beanie Babies!
- What?

50:38.539 --> 50:41.542
Beanie Babies! Beanie Babies!

50:41.542 --> 50:43.961
It won't download. I keep trying.

50:43.961 --> 50:46.547
Too many people are
logging on to the site at once.

50:46.547 --> 50:48.048
So, no one can see anything?

50:48.632 --> 50:51.844
Oh, shit. I'm gonna get fired.

50:52.803 --> 50:54.680
We broke the entire Internet thing!

50:56.348 --> 50:57.641
Not exactly.

50:57.641 --> 51:00.102
It was our personal server lines
that got overwhelmed.

51:00.102 --> 51:02.521
By 18 million Beanie Baby lovers. Unbelievable.

51:02.521 --> 51:05.274
Again, that's not the amount
of people on our site, but--

51:05.274 --> 51:06.859
Amazing. It's just fantastic.

51:06.859 --> 51:08.777
Did I get any press calls about it?

51:08.777 --> 51:10.195
- Who are you?
- Hi.

51:10.195 --> 51:13.323
This is Linda Wallace, one of
the original Beanie Baby collectors.

51:13.323 --> 51:15.242
- Oh, God.
- It is such an honor to--

51:17.035 --> 51:18.203
Just one sec.

51:18.787 --> 51:21.915
Remember I told you about the cul-de-sac
that started the local craze?

51:21.915 --> 51:24.418
Well, Linda was ground zero.

51:24.418 --> 51:25.502
Guilty.

51:26.295 --> 51:29.965
Linda does the <i>Beanie Baby Collectors</i>
radio update on WGN now.

51:30.591 --> 51:31.592
You agreed to meet?

51:32.092 --> 51:34.761
And it-- I am just beyond excited
to meet you,

51:34.761 --> 51:37.556
Ty Warner, in person. Wow.

51:37.556 --> 51:39.308
You do a radio show about my products?

51:39.308 --> 51:42.811
Plus, I actually publish
the <i>Beanie Baby Price Guide</i>,

51:42.811 --> 51:46.190
which people call the bible
of the collectors' market.

51:46.940 --> 51:48.400
I was hoping you'd sign it.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.904
And who gave you permission to do that?
Just out of curiosity.

51:53.113 --> 51:54.364
I didn't know I needed to get--

51:54.364 --> 51:56.950
Well, the guide drives tons
of customers to our site.

51:56.950 --> 51:58.619
I mean, nothing hooks new collectors

51:58.619 --> 52:01.455
like hearing Linda made $300,000
on Beanies.

52:02.456 --> 52:03.457
300,000?

52:03.457 --> 52:04.917
In just three months.

52:05.417 --> 52:06.585
How exactly?

52:06.585 --> 52:10.589
Well, there I was, just snapping up
as many as I could here in the States,

52:10.589 --> 52:13.008
but then my sister went to Liverpool,

52:13.008 --> 52:14.718
which-- She's a real Beatle maniac--

52:14.718 --> 52:18.180
And she saw piles of Iggy the Iguana
and Whisper the Deer,

52:18.180 --> 52:20.015
which I have been looking everywhere for.

52:20.015 --> 52:22.851
So, I tracked down the number
of your UK distributor,

52:22.851 --> 52:25.187
ordered 200 pieces direct,
plus shipping fees.

52:25.187 --> 52:27.773
Whole thing cost me $2,000
and very nearly my marriage,

52:27.773 --> 52:30.526
but 90 days later,
those babies bought us a BMW

52:30.526 --> 52:32.319
and a time-share in Florida.

52:32.319 --> 52:35.364
So now people listen
when I tell them Beanies

52:35.364 --> 52:37.199
are the best investment around.

52:38.242 --> 52:42.037
Plus, they're cute as all get-out.
You know that.

52:42.037 --> 52:44.414
Oh, gosh, you just gotta come on my show.

52:45.832 --> 52:48.585
<i>Ty filed a lawsuit by the end
of the following day.</i>

52:48.585 --> 52:51.129
<i>And he forced eBay
to change its "Beanie Babies" category</i>

52:51.129 --> 52:52.965
<i>to "Beanbag Plush."</i>

52:53.465 --> 52:56.426
<i>But by then, the craze was uncontrollable.</i>

52:57.970 --> 53:01.056
<i>Beanie Babies
are selling hotter than tamales.</i>

53:01.056 --> 53:04.560
<i>The beanbag has
been transformed into a commercial rage.</i>

53:04.560 --> 53:05.936
<i>To protect themselves,</i>

53:05.936 --> 53:10.107
<i>delivery workers have been painting
over Ty's logos on the boxes they deliver.</i>

53:12.568 --> 53:14.945
<i>People were buying
and selling half a million dollars</i>

53:14.945 --> 53:19.324
<i>of Beanie Babies on eBay every month,
which was bonkers.</i>

53:19.324 --> 53:20.826
<i>But what they couldn't see</i>

53:20.826 --> 53:24.329
<i>was that everybody who wanted a piece
of that was buying new,</i>

53:24.329 --> 53:26.623
<i>off the shelf from us.</i>

53:26.623 --> 53:29.501
<i>So when eBay did half a million dollars,</i>

53:29.501 --> 53:32.796
<i>we did 400 times that in retail.</i>

53:33.297 --> 53:37.634
<i>$200 million every month.</i>

53:38.677 --> 53:41.013
<i>It was so much money.</i>

53:45.142 --> 53:47.895
<i>And we were constantly
expanding just to keep up.</i>

53:52.399 --> 53:54.693
<i>Everything just got
a little bit out of control.</i>

53:57.738 --> 53:58.739
<i>Ty included.</i>

54:00.032 --> 54:03.285
Maya. Did you see the latest numbers?

54:03.285 --> 54:04.578
People keep wanting more.

54:05.454 --> 54:06.955
Mr. Warner, a word?

54:06.955 --> 54:08.290
No, thanks. Who's this?

54:08.290 --> 54:10.292
Rep from Toys "R" Us or Walmart.

54:10.292 --> 54:13.253
- Well, get rid of him.
- We tried. They keep coming back.

54:13.795 --> 54:16.632
Hey! We only sell to mom-and-pops.

54:16.632 --> 54:18.717
No big-box stores, is that understood?

54:18.717 --> 54:22.387
And why don't we sell to big-box stores?
Anyone?

54:22.930 --> 54:24.139
Okay, Maya, go ahead.

54:24.139 --> 54:27.893
Their cheap product displays
invite price wars and comparison shopping.

54:27.893 --> 54:29.811
The America--
The-- More the America stuff.

54:29.811 --> 54:30.938
Right.

54:30.938 --> 54:34.566
Big-box stores kill small businesses
and trash the dreams of the little guy.

54:34.566 --> 54:37.402
And America is all about the little guy.

54:37.402 --> 54:40.989
And we are all about the little guy.

54:40.989 --> 54:42.991
Marcus, is that shipment
from China on time?

54:42.991 --> 54:45.577
Yes. They wanna know how many
new models we're introducing next month?

54:45.577 --> 54:46.954
Well, everybody wants to know that.

54:46.954 --> 54:49.373
Also, they asked about
an Asian distribution deal like the UK.

54:49.373 --> 54:53.961
No, listen! No UK! No UK!

54:53.961 --> 54:57.673
Hey, did you see those tweaks
that I made to the platypus design?

54:57.673 --> 54:59.508
I did. They were very good.

54:59.508 --> 55:00.801
- Yeah. I knew you'd like them.
- Yeah.

55:00.801 --> 55:03.846
I'm sorry to interrupt, but <i>Parade</i> needs
an answer about the profile.

55:03.846 --> 55:07.057
They'd like to interview Ava too
about the popularity of Spooky.

55:07.057 --> 55:09.226
The audience reach could be huge.

55:09.226 --> 55:11.436
First of all, Spooky is not that popular.

55:11.436 --> 55:13.814
And also, no more dinky press, okay?

55:13.814 --> 55:15.607
<i>Parade</i> has over 20 million subscribers.

55:15.607 --> 55:20.362
I only want to speak to Oprah Winfrey.
Has she reached out?

55:20.362 --> 55:22.114
- Not yet.
- Thank you.

55:22.114 --> 55:24.491
Steven Spielberg's office called again
and now they're offering

55:24.491 --> 55:27.536
- triple what they were offering before.
- Not interested again. I'm not a sellout.

55:27.536 --> 55:29.663
Is that selling out to Mattel
and the Barbie tie-in then?

55:29.663 --> 55:32.666
I am sorry for that. I will pass,
and I'll pass on McDonald's as well.

55:32.666 --> 55:34.918
Why would you do that? I love McDonald's.

55:34.918 --> 55:36.587
- You do?
- Yes. Of course.

55:37.462 --> 55:40.382
Of course I love McD-- Everybody loves--
The president loves McDonald's.

55:40.382 --> 55:42.259
- You love McDonald's, right?
- Fiercely.

55:42.259 --> 55:44.845
Don't you think partnering with them
might be too big a strain

55:44.845 --> 55:47.347
- on our distribution system?
- Oh, my God.

55:47.347 --> 55:49.641
Can you imagine the markets
that's gonna open up?

55:49.641 --> 55:52.102
Sure, but we can barely keep up
with the mom-and-pops already.

55:52.102 --> 55:53.854
It would be like a Super Bowl ad
for a bake sale.

55:53.854 --> 55:57.399
- You heard her. We love McDonald's.
- Great. I will follow up.

55:57.399 --> 56:00.652
- Mickey D's!
- Ty, I mean, it's thrilling

56:00.652 --> 56:02.154
the demand for Beanies is so nuts,

56:02.154 --> 56:05.240
but we gotta be able to handle it.
Remember New Year's?

56:05.240 --> 56:09.161
Listen, we can put even tinier
Beanie Babies inside of Happy Meals.

56:09.161 --> 56:13.832
Little tiny guys. It'd be so cute.
And adorable.

56:13.832 --> 56:17.211
Profitable. Go with me to the airport.
I wanna go over designs.

56:19.546 --> 56:22.341
<i>It's hard to know how
to reason with delusion.</i>

56:23.717 --> 56:26.386
<i>And sometimes you just
go along to get along.</i>

56:26.386 --> 56:29.014
<i>By late '92, Clinton was president,</i>

56:29.515 --> 56:32.476
<i>and I was in London
nailing down foreign expansion.</i>

56:33.936 --> 56:35.521
<i>It's only 3:00 my time.</i>

56:35.521 --> 56:38.190
I could stay here all night,
but I don't want to keep you.

56:38.190 --> 56:41.193
Were you able
to look at the proposal I faxed?

56:41.193 --> 56:44.279
- Yes, and it's quite tempting.
- Good. Good.

56:44.279 --> 56:46.281
But I'm afraid there's a bit of a snag.

56:47.157 --> 56:50.118
Surely there's nothing we can't work out.

56:52.996 --> 56:55.249
Legal says we can't make a deal with you

56:55.249 --> 56:58.001
since you're not technically
the owner of Ty Inc.

57:02.130 --> 57:04.132
My partner and I run the company together.

57:04.883 --> 57:05.926
I do the deals,

57:05.926 --> 57:08.303
he signs off once I walk him
through the numbers.

57:08.303 --> 57:10.848
It's-- We've been working
like this for years.

57:10.848 --> 57:13.559
I'm sure it's just a miscommunication.

57:15.102 --> 57:16.854
But we've been told differently.

57:22.693 --> 57:24.152
I thought you knew.

57:24.152 --> 57:26.154
He said your priorities had changed

57:26.154 --> 57:29.366
and he was restructuring the company
based on both your wishes.

57:30.117 --> 57:32.369
I got the sense you were trying
to have a child.

57:32.369 --> 57:35.831
No. No, no, no. No.

57:36.373 --> 57:39.501
You need to restore
the previous agreement immediately.

57:40.169 --> 57:42.629
I'm sorry, Robbie, but my hands are tied.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.593
That looks great, Ty.

57:48.719 --> 57:49.803
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

57:49.803 --> 57:51.597
I'm just working on my smile. Okay.

57:51.597 --> 57:53.807
Just let me get my smile,
then I'll go like this,

57:53.807 --> 57:55.142
and then you snap your picture.

57:55.142 --> 57:57.269
Sure. Okay, you let me know when.

57:59.771 --> 58:01.648
- Go.
- No, I-- Okay.

58:02.232 --> 58:03.233
No, I think we got it.

58:03.233 --> 58:05.569
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Hey, Robbie, just--

58:05.569 --> 58:07.196
- Take five.
- Yeah.

58:08.155 --> 58:10.157
Okay, hon, what seems to be the--
Welcome back.

58:10.157 --> 58:12.659
Fuck you.
You know exactly what the problem is.

58:13.452 --> 58:17.831
Your little restructuring stunt
is a sick joke.

58:17.831 --> 58:21.668
Robbie.
This has always been Ty Inc., right?

58:22.794 --> 58:26.548
I mean, you've been an incredible helper,
but this has always been my company.

58:28.926 --> 58:30.761
Are you fucking kidding?

58:30.761 --> 58:34.056
Roberta,
you know I don't like that rough language.

58:34.723 --> 58:36.391
You know what I don't like?

58:36.391 --> 58:42.022
Getting fucked out of a company I created,
that we created together.

58:42.022 --> 58:44.483
That's not happening.
Why do you have to be so dramatic?

58:44.483 --> 58:48.487
I am no longer cofounder,
and my salary has been reduced 75%.

58:49.571 --> 58:51.532
Okay.
Can you keep your voice down a little bit?

58:51.532 --> 58:53.992
Don't fucking tell me
to keep my voice down!

58:55.953 --> 58:57.746
That wasn't salary. That was commissions.

58:57.746 --> 59:01.708
And commissions don't make sense at the
level we're working at now. They don't.

59:01.708 --> 59:03.293
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

59:03.293 --> 59:05.337
Yeah, I'm just doing what's necessary.

59:05.921 --> 59:09.299
You know, running the real
actual business over here.

59:16.139 --> 59:19.852
And as far as expanding into the UK,
now's not the time.

59:19.852 --> 59:23.564
But when it is,
I have our perfect partners lined up.

59:25.065 --> 59:27.526
Actually came up with the idea
in the shower, believe it or not.

59:28.318 --> 59:29.653
Jehovah's Witnesses.

59:31.989 --> 59:34.366
The greatest one-on-one salesmen
in the world. How brilliant is that?

59:38.245 --> 59:40.998
Robbie,
I-- Honestly, what is the big deal?

59:40.998 --> 59:43.458
I mean, we're still together.

59:43.458 --> 59:46.837
We're not breaking up.
We're still partners in everything.

59:46.837 --> 59:49.089
I mean, what is mine is yours.

59:50.007 --> 59:52.467
You have the golden ticket. You have me.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.056
What a prize.

01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:04.146
It's pointless to talk to you
when you're like this.

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:06.273
- I mean--
- When I stand up for myself, you mean.

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.066
Yeah, what a bummer for you.

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:12.946
You should call one of your easier women.
Lorraine from the coffee shop.

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:15.616
- Julie from the dry cleaner.
- Okay.

01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:18.368
Any one of the dozens
from the trade circuit.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:20.037
I know about them all, Ty.

01:00:20.037 --> 01:00:24.833
- Okay. We mutually agreed to occasion--
- Go fuck yourself.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:29.004
You're a child. A selfish child.

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:34.593
And I cannot believe
how long I've put up with it.

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.555
Hey, listen to me.

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.226
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be
wasting away at the Speedi-Shop.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.104
Where's the gratitude?
I've given you an amazing life.

01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:48.690
I made you.

01:00:53.529 --> 01:00:56.365
Mrs. Warner. We're waiting.

01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:59.201
You guys, this is definitely the one.

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:04.748
- No, you don't like it? What?
- We love it.

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.999
Never take it off.

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:11.463
Have I told you how excited we are
that this wedding is finally happening?

01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:13.465
Thank you.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.634
So have you guys picked a honeymoon?

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:18.637
Yeah, Fiji. All of us, we're all going.
"Familymoon."

01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:22.975
A familymoon in Fiji, all right.
Better live this dream.

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:29.439
- Hello? Ty?
- Hi, Mom!

01:01:29.982 --> 01:01:31.191
We're in here.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:33.527
Ty ran away.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.823
What? Where'd he go?

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:40.200
Out the door. I don't know.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.202
Maybe the new house?

01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:43.287
Oh, my God.

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.164
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.834
They're asleep in their room,
and I don't know how long I'll be, but--

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:50.002
Okay, don't worry. Just go.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.837
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah, be careful.

01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:13.442
Ty?

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.909
Sweetheart?

01:02:35.047 --> 01:02:36.048
Ty?

01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:56.443
Ty?

01:03:05.744 --> 01:03:09.706
Sweetheart? What happened? Are you okay?

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:12.000
I can't. I just can't. I can't.

01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:14.586
Can't what?

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:17.256
I can't do this.

01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:20.801
Honey, what's happened? What's going on?

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.719
I just-- Getting married.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.974
I don't know how to do family.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.061
I don't know how to--

01:03:31.061 --> 01:03:32.980
I don't know how to do this. I--

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:35.315
I didn't have a family.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.610
No one ever--
Do you know-- No one ever even--

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.571
- Hey. Sweetheart.
- Do you know--

01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:43.574
- No one ever--
- You're loved now.

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.327
The girls and I love you so much.

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:54.710
I can't be a parent.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.384
I'm the child.

01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:07.264
I need to be taken care of.

01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:17.566
Hey.

01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:25.908
It's okay. Sweetheart.

01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:28.994
I need you.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.627
Hold me like I'm a little boy.

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.648
- Hi.
- Hi, ma'am.

01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:00.359
I'm gonna need access
to the garage to unload.

01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:05.447
- Returned products, 48 boxes?
- Yeah sure.

01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:06.532
Okay.

01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:09.826
All right. Thank you.

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.204
- Great. I'll open up.
- All right.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.090
Gorgeous light, isn't it?

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:27.928
I know you love window seats,
so I ordered a whole wall of them.

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:34.685
We need to talk.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.148
Listen, the freak-out last night.

01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:43.986
It's over.

01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:46.196
I feel much better now. I do.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:49.908
Good. Well, I wish I did.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.537
You don't wanna sit down?

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:06.884
I'm in love with you, Ty.
But I didn't wanna be.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:11.722
I was gonna stay single
for Maren and Ava, remember?

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:14.975
Spare them a man abandoning them.

01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:22.399
But you convinced me you were different, devoted.

01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.110
And then you pull this?

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:28.697
No.

01:06:34.244 --> 01:06:36.663
No, you gotta
find someone else to be your mom.

01:06:36.663 --> 01:06:38.248
- I'm booked already.
- Wait.

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.333
What are you saying?

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:47.007
I'm saying, I let you in to be a partner,
to really build something good together.

01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:48.884
And if you can do that, wonderful.

01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:52.346
But I'm not gonna stick around
if you plan to fuck it up.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:06.109
I'm sorry. You're right.

01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:11.698
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:17.329
I will never let you down again. I swear.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:22.543
Please don't leave. Please.

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:26.880
Everything good that's happened to me
is because of you guys. Did you know that?

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.469
We are bonded forever.
There's no one I'd rather be with.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.014
Do you understand that?

01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:40.310
You're my home.

01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:43.272
You're my rock.

01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:46.149
You're my life.

01:07:58.412 --> 01:08:00.622
<i>Break out those raincoats
and umbrellas, folks.</i>

01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:02.040
<i>We got a few days of rain...</i>

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.668
- Do you know what you want?
- Nuggets. Always.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.712
Same. Sweet and sour or honey?

01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.215
Barbecue. What's wrong with you?

01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:13.635
<i>Riots broke out at McDonald's
restaurants across the nation today</i>

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.220
<i>as the company
launched their Teenie Beanie promotion.</i>

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.139
Yeah.

01:08:17.139 --> 01:08:19.474
<i>The first batch of Beanies was meant
to last two weeks, but ran out...</i>

01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:22.394
Can you believe something we work on
is that popular?

01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:23.729
Yes.

01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:38.911
What is happening?

01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:42.288
<i>At one McDonald's,
a delivery man arriving with a case</i>

01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:45.000
of the Teenie Beanies was tackled

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.710
by overzealous customers.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.546
Thanks to this little guy,
the Cubs sold out Wrigley Field today

01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.424
for the first time in decades.

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.885
Two divorcées unable to reach an agreement

01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:58.095
about how to split their
prized Beanie Baby collection

01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:01.183
were ordered to make their picks
under judicial supervision.

01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:03.185
US Trade Rep Charlene Barshefsky

01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:06.188
has turned over
the 40 Beanie Babies she procured

01:09:06.188 --> 01:09:08.732
in Beijing during her trip
with President Clinton,

01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:10.234
in violation of trade law.

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:12.528
Traffic on I-95 shut down for hours

01:09:12.528 --> 01:09:15.656
after a crashed semi
carrying Beanie Babies

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:18.075
<i>sparked a frenzy you have
to see to believe.</i>

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:24.831
Looking good.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:27.835
Did you see the latest numbers?

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.379
Billion dollar profit year. Congrats.

01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:34.424
I'm gonna make over $700 million. Just me.

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:37.553
Did you see the truck crash
with the Beanies?

01:09:37.553 --> 01:09:38.886
Insane.

01:09:39.388 --> 01:09:41.180
Poor Beanies. But--

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.350
I mean, managing the craze has
become a whole separate job.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:48.354
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you, if you've got a sec.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:49.773
I'm all ears.

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:52.526
I think it's time for you
to consider a company restructure.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.945
And what do you mean by that?

01:09:54.945 --> 01:09:58.657
Well, everyone knows you're
a superstar design and marketing genius,

01:09:58.657 --> 01:09:59.825
like no one else alive.

01:09:59.825 --> 01:10:02.411
I mean, it just--
it seems silly to distract you

01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:05.747
from your natural talents
with mundane business chores.

01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.749
I know Robbie used to handle all those.

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:10.419
I don't wanna hear that name. Thank you.

01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:15.716
But this company has transformed into
a mega success since then. Thanks to you.

01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:18.177
You just need
to keep channeling your brilliance

01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.345
where it's most fun and fulfilling.

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:26.226
While you, you know, tap someone you trust
to handle pesky, day-to-day headaches.

01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:30.480
Chief operating officer.
A consigliere. A right hand.

01:10:31.982 --> 01:10:33.817
Someone to deal with all the boring stuff,

01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:37.154
freeing you up to continue doing the real,
important work.

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:45.204
I like it.

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:50.709
Yep. There we go.
You're the best. Keep it up.

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:52.586
<i>I liked the bullshit and the boring stuff.</i>

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:53.879
What's next?

01:10:53.879 --> 01:10:55.964
- <i>Solving puzzles, connecting dots...</i>
- Hi.

01:10:55.964 --> 01:10:58.634
- <i>...streamlining the system. Making it grow.</i>
- I actually have this for you.

01:10:58.634 --> 01:10:59.676
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:02.262
<i>Thank God for the great equalizer
of the Internet,</i>

01:11:02.846 --> 01:11:05.140
<i>saving me from ten years
of higher education,</i>

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.391
<i>setting me up to take charge of--</i>

01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:10.145
- Everybody, listen up! Meet Blaine.
- Hi, team.

01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:13.857
Ty has brought me
on to put the fun in restructure

01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.943
and take this company to the next level.

01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:20.656
So, who's with me?
Who is ready to go big or go home?

01:11:20.656 --> 01:11:22.824
Come on. Let me hear ya.
Let me hear you now.

01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:24.535
There you go.

01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:26.828
What a bastard.

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.998
Well, if it's any consolation,

01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:32.459
everyone knows you're the one
really running the show.

01:11:35.295 --> 01:11:36.380
It isn't.

01:11:38.715 --> 01:11:41.009
I created and built this company,

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:45.722
and I have no rights, no salary claims.

01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.142
How is that even possible?

01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:52.521
'Cause the system isn't designed
for people like us.

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.898
Fucking hell.

01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.653
I spent my whole fucking life
taking care of people.

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:05.200
And I thought Ty was the one person
who didn't need that.

01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:13.417
What the fuck is that? Come here.

01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:18.589
Oh, boy.

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:23.385
That ass-face is spying on me?

01:12:23.385 --> 01:12:27.097
- All of us probably.
- That fucked-up motherfucker.

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:30.309
He's heard a lot of stuff
I really wish he hadn't.

01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:32.686
There's gotta be a way
we can use this against him.

01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:39.568
Uh-huh. See you then.

01:12:41.653 --> 01:12:43.906
Hey. Showtime.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.242
So, I just didn't see the brilliance

01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:50.871
of the whole UK, Jehovah's Witness idea,
because I was so mad.

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:52.873
Sure, that temper of yours.

01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:58.253
But it is pure genius.
I just-- Not that I would tell him that.

01:12:58.253 --> 01:13:01.882
Of course not. But Jehovah's Witnesses,
who'd have thunk?

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.009
It takes a brain like Ty's.

01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:08.096
That total virtuoso,
off-the-charts mastermind.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.433
So, you guys good again?

01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:17.147
Getting there. He'll probably buy me

01:13:17.648 --> 01:13:21.401
some amazing gift,
and then I'll be putty in his hands again.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:24.112
Haven't you been wanting to learn guitar?

01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:26.031
- I don't know.
- No.

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:33.497
- <i>Beta</i>, tell us what's wrong.
- Everything.

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.877
Thought I had it all figured out.

01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:41.588
But my boss hired some slick
idiot consultant instead.

01:13:41.588 --> 01:13:44.883
You've been fired? After all that you
gave up, they fired you?

01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:47.845
I still have my job.
I just wanted a better one.

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:51.431
Okay, you're 22.
These things, they take time.

01:13:51.431 --> 01:13:53.392
I've been there five years.

01:13:53.934 --> 01:13:57.271
I understand the company better
than anyone, and I see where it's going.

01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:58.647
Which is where, exactly?

01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:02.734
Well, soon we'll finally be able to keep
up with the demand for Beanie Babies.

01:14:02.734 --> 01:14:04.027
Which will actually be a problem,

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:06.864
because a lot of their appeal
has been how hard they are to get.

01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:09.533
So, you're saying this will be trouble?

01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:11.994
Yeah, if we don't get ahead of it,
yeah, definitely.

01:14:11.994 --> 01:14:13.412
How much time do we have?

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:17.165
I mean, it's not like there are
precise metrics for measuring, like...

01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:24.464
Wait.

01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:30.679
You'll be sick of me, I'll be
in Tokyo so much, as much as needed.

01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:32.514
The Asian launch is my top focus.

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.434
Hey, team.

01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:40.355
What a surprise. This is Maya Kumar,
our online girl.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:43.609
Maya, this is Mr. Harano. Mr. Suzuki.

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:46.069
They're interested in partnering with us
for the Japan market.

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:48.113
We were just laying out a road map

01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:51.700
for creating the kind of demand there
that we did here.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.784
Great.

01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:55.871
Then you already talked about our unique
relationship with the secondary market

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:58.957
and the crucial role it plays
in any smart strategy going forward?

01:14:58.957 --> 01:15:01.627
Yes. We covered how we control
the collector craze

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.378
with limited runs and retirements,

01:15:03.378 --> 01:15:06.340
and how that fuels demand
for the entire line.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.884
And how it's the unlimited runs

01:15:08.884 --> 01:15:11.762
where we and our distribution partners
make the big bucks.

01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:14.723
See, the primary market,
that's where the profits are.

01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:20.729
And the secondary market, while handy,
well, it's secondary.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:23.815
- No offense, Maya.
- No, none taken.

01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:26.527
Demand is what we all care about.
Demand is king.

01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:30.030
It's amazing how we can now measure
and understand that demand

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:32.241
using secondary market tools to help us

01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:34.618
steer our business
more skillfully than ever before.

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:38.330
Uh-huh. So, back to the rollout.
I think the smarter--

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.790
What are these tools?

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:46.713
Well, the most basic is using
eBay markups to measure demand.

01:15:46.713 --> 01:15:51.134
So this is how much we ship, and this is
how much they're marking them up on eBay.

01:15:52.177 --> 01:15:55.973
On the high end, we've seen
Peanut the Elephant go for $7,000.

01:15:57.474 --> 01:16:00.727
And on the low end,
there's no markup at all.

01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:04.273
The more we ship, the lower the markup.

01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:08.944
But if we ever cross zero,
market collapses.

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:11.405
- Which will not happen.
- No.

01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:13.532
We actively monitor that threshold,

01:16:13.532 --> 01:16:16.785
and we ship
up to 33 million Beanies a month,

01:16:16.785 --> 01:16:19.037
before there's any cause for concern.

01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:21.790
Right, 33 million.

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.334
But that's just our simplest projection.

01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:27.963
And it's not the full picture,
because demand isn't static.

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:30.799
We now have a gold mine of data
from the eBay market.

01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:33.969
Bids on a given model,
percentage where reserve is never met.

01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:37.431
Timing of response bids,
plus a half a dozen others.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:41.393
These metrics give us incredible
new insight on where demand is headed.

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:47.649
So in three months,
it'll be in this range.

01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:50.611
So number is not 33 million.

01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:54.823
It could be as low as 26 million.

01:16:55.407 --> 01:16:57.618
I mean, worst-case scenario.

01:16:57.618 --> 01:17:00.287
And thankfully, our worst-case scenario

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:02.706
is still overwhelming global demand.

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:05.876
Provided we understand,
respect and protect it.

01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:09.421
So instead of just blindly pushing
our numbers up and hoping for the best,

01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:13.634
we here at Ty grow our market
strategically, confidently,

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:16.553
using tools no one's ever used before.

01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.056
I mean, we're light-years ahead
of everyone on this stuff.

01:17:19.056 --> 01:17:22.100
And that's why we're the most
successful toy company in the world.

01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:31.401
Well, that was great. They were impressed.

01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:33.904
Good. I'm glad. But it wasn't for them.

01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:36.782
My life is this company.
You know that, right?

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.411
They're totally in. They just asked
for the same terms as the UK.

01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:45.249
Hey. No. We don't talk about the UK! Ever.

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:48.919
Okay. Yeah, I'll-- No worries.
I'll fix it.

01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.129
- They're gonna be incredible partners.
- Thank you.

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:57.219
Gotta be honest, Ty.
Blaine doesn't understand our company.

01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.221
I don't think we need his advice.

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:02.432
Well, he has some things to learn,
but he has an amazing track record.

01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:05.269
Maximizing profits
at soulless corporations.

01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:08.897
But we're unique.
Our dysfunction is part of our heart.

01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:12.067
I mean,
no one knows that better than you. And me.

01:18:13.944 --> 01:18:18.323
I'm the person for this job, Ty.
You don't need outsiders.

01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:20.951
I helped take Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:22.202
And I've loved it.

01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.497
Coming up with the poems,
running the website, fostering the market.

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:28.375
I mean, everything. But in all this time,

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.919
I've only ever had an "assistant" title
and an hourly wage.

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.212
You've had raises.

01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:36.842
True. I started at minimum wage.
And now I make $12 an hour.

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:43.557
Well, I know a lot of people
that would like to make $12 an hour.

01:18:45.142 --> 01:18:47.936
Considering all I do,
I think there's room for improvement.

01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:51.690
We were the first company to have
a website for our customers.

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:55.027
Have you noticed everyone does that now?
That was my idea.

01:18:55.611 --> 01:19:01.158
But using my resources, or my initiative.
I mean, I'm paying you to have ideas.

01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:04.578
Well, I've netted a fortune
for this company, over and over.

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:07.289
I mean,
I understand our business inside and out,

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:10.000
and I'm telling you now,
there are signs of real trouble.

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:12.920
Have you seen that piece about this being
a bubble about to burst?

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.672
I don't accept babbling from outsiders.

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:18.509
Sure, but even some of our most
loyal collectors are getting frustrated.

01:19:18.509 --> 01:19:22.304
Complaining about overproduction
and oversupply, pleading with us

01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:24.681
to be more thoughtful
about new Beanie intros.

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:27.559
The collectors are idiots.
I hate the collectors.

01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:31.855
- They're our bellwether, our engine.
- I'm the bellwether. I'm the engine.

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:33.398
Who's the billionaire here?

01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:36.568
You. Of course.

01:19:37.778 --> 01:19:41.240
But if there's turbulence ahead,
you need me helping navigate.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.116
Not some clueless hotshot.

01:19:43.116 --> 01:19:45.285
Okay,
Blaine might be great at old-school sales,

01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:49.373
but our value is online now, and I run
that. I run fucking circles around that.

01:19:52.584 --> 01:19:54.378
- Okay, I've heard you.
- No. Are you sure?

01:19:55.504 --> 01:19:57.548
'Cause I thought I was being clear
the first time,

01:19:57.548 --> 01:19:59.967
so I wanna make really sure
that I'm being clear now.

01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:04.513
I'm your right hand, Ty. Me. Maya Kumar.

01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:13.772
You know how much you mean to me
and this company.

01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:17.609
I'll make it right.

01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:22.155
- Good. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.252
I looked into suing him.

01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:37.921
It would cost every penny I have,
and I still wouldn't win.

01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:40.674
Have you considered poisoning him?

01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:43.093
Countless times.

01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:45.888
I'm sorry, hon.

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:48.056
Doughnut?

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.936
I think coffee will mask
the antifreeze better.

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.063
And let me just say,

01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:58.817
I couldn't be more thrilled
that this proud American company

01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.278
is gonna take over the world.

01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:04.156
Starting with the UK, and then beyond.

01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:07.284
So, everybody, buckle up! Let's do it!

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.828
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:16.168
<i>They say good artists borrow
and great artists steal.</i>

01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:20.130
<i>And Ty was the greatest
bullshit artist around.</i>

01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.133
Robbie, baby. There you are.

01:21:25.427 --> 01:21:26.720
I've been looking for you.

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:31.642
Hope you're not too mad.

01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:33.644
About?

01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:38.357
Foreign expansion plan.
My foreign expansion plan.

01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:43.403
No. I'm glad it's finally happening.

01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:46.406
- Good.
- Good.

01:21:46.907 --> 01:21:47.991
Good, good, good.

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.163
We have a killer UK deal in the works,

01:21:54.039 --> 01:21:57.584
and our distribution partners
are raring to go.

01:21:58.210 --> 01:21:59.086
Amazing.

01:21:59.086 --> 01:22:01.380
It is amazing, yes. I'm excited.

01:22:06.468 --> 01:22:08.095
Hey, the cats came in.

01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:10.389
They're-- Listen,
they're a different color than you wanted.

01:22:10.389 --> 01:22:12.391
- You wanna take a look at them?
- I'm a little busy.

01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:13.475
Okay.

01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:15.894
All right, hot sauce.

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.357
Come find me when you can, okay?

01:22:22.317 --> 01:22:24.111
I bet that guitar looks good on you.

01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:26.655
I-- You--

01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.073
You're a mind reader.

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.908
I knew you were gonna say that.

01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:32.703
Come find me, okay?
I wanna show you the cats.

01:22:33.912 --> 01:22:34.913
Okay.

01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:51.847
<i>It took me a while to realize all
the ways hurt people hurt people.</i>

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:58.770
<i>Turns out, all you have to do to have
a first day of the rest of your life</i>

01:22:59.271 --> 01:23:00.272
<i>is wake the fuck up.</i>

01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:04.067
...job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day, plus some Saturdays.

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:06.653
- You said you're in school?
- Yeah, I'm in school--

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:08.947
<i>Roberta, sweetie,</i>

01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:11.825
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:14.912
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:17.748
Bye.

01:23:22.336 --> 01:23:25.088
Yeah, I'm in school,
but the schedule's not a problem.

01:23:29.343 --> 01:23:30.385
All good?

01:23:31.261 --> 01:23:32.679
Mexico, here we come.

01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:49.738
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:52.491
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:23:58.664 --> 01:23:59.790
Robbie!

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:05.838
What's going on?

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.722
Robbie.

01:24:45.794 --> 01:24:46.879
Oh, God.

01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:51.049
Okay.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.261
Shit.

01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:18.368
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Okay.

01:25:18.869 --> 01:25:20.078
Just in time.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.208
You look cute.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.210
- Thanks.
- Stressed, but cute.

01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.087
I'm already an hour late
to Ty's office holiday party.

01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:31.715
I still can't believe he scheduled it
for the same night.

01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:34.593
- Yeah, it's a busy time of year.
- Great job, Dragons,

01:25:34.593 --> 01:25:36.512
- go ahead and stand up.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:39.556
Shake. Make circles.

01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:40.849
Mom!

01:25:41.517 --> 01:25:43.435
- They're all calling her a liar!
- What?

01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:45.812
- What happened?
- Hey, sweetheart. Come here.

01:25:45.812 --> 01:25:48.190
- What's going on?
- Drew got a new Spooky

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:52.486
and the tag doesn't say my name anymore,
so now no one thinks I made it.

01:25:52.486 --> 01:25:55.280
- Sweetheart, of course you made Spooky.
- Yeah.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.325
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Let's see.

01:26:03.121 --> 01:26:05.666
This must be just a--
It's a factory mistake...

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:08.001
- Yes.
- ...or this is a fake Spooky.

01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.963
- It's not a real one.
- And whatever it is,

01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:13.715
- it's all gonna be all right, okay?
- Absolutely.

01:26:13.715 --> 01:26:15.968
I'm gonna go see Ty now
and get this whole thing sorted out.

01:26:15.968 --> 01:26:17.052
Yeah?

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:22.224
In the meantime, I am so proud of you.

01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:24.142
What you--
What's this you're wearing, huh?

01:26:24.142 --> 01:26:25.310
- A green belt.
- Yeah!

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.564
- And I'm a yellow belt!
- Yes, you are.

01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:29.648
Are you gonna celebrate?

01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.441
- Yeah.
- Yes. We're having a pizza party, yeah?

01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:32.693
Yay.

01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:35.946
- Yes, we are.
- Yeah, well, Mommy's gotta go.

01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:38.615
But, I love you. I love you.

01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:40.492
- Love you.
- Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

01:26:40.492 --> 01:26:41.743
- Thank you.
- Call me later.

01:26:42.744 --> 01:26:47.207
So before we go to this pizza party,
how about we burn this fake Spooky?

01:26:49.293 --> 01:26:50.836
A little light arson, maybe?

01:26:50.836 --> 01:26:52.171
What is arson?

01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:11.064
<i>You know,
even when you built your own ship,</i>

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.026
<i>you still gotta protect it from pirates.</i>

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.404
God, I can't wait
to be rid of that douchebag.

01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:20.073
Which one?

01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:25.579
<i>Here he is,
ladies and gentlemen. Ty Warner!</i>

01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:35.255
Hey, everybody! Hi!
Look at all these festive faces.

01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:37.132
I hope you're all enjoying the party?

01:27:38.634 --> 01:27:41.136
And I hope everybody
is enjoying the present?

01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:44.097
- Yeah!
- Those little bears.

01:27:44.097 --> 01:27:48.810
Those little bears, I guarantee are worth
$10,000 already on the World Wide Web.

01:27:50.354 --> 01:27:56.735
Those little cuties! And as a holiday
bonus this year, everyone's--

01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:59.071
Drumroll, please.

01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:02.991
Everyone's getting double their salary!

01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:05.202
What?

01:28:06.203 --> 01:28:08.789
Double your salary!

01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:14.670
Feel the energy of the room!

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.465
Feel the energy of Ty Inc.!

01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:22.761
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.

01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:24.638
Happy Hanukkah, whatever it is.

01:28:25.347 --> 01:28:31.436
It has been an extra special year,
and we are an extra special company.

01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:32.521
Yes.

01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:36.567
- We're amazingly unique, as you all know.
- Yep.

01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:40.237
And because of that,
we're doing amazingly well.

01:28:40.237 --> 01:28:43.824
- We are winners.
- Yes!

01:28:43.824 --> 01:28:46.368
We create demand.

01:28:47.661 --> 01:28:50.122
And this year,
we're gonna move more product than ever!

01:28:50.122 --> 01:28:51.665
Yes!

01:28:51.665 --> 01:28:54.168
- Because at Ty Inc. you go big...
- Wait, what?

01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:55.961
...or you go home!

01:28:56.670 --> 01:28:58.046
That's right.

01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:03.468
How fun is this?
Blaine's coming on board full time.

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:06.305
- There he is.
- See a lot more of me. Right?

01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:09.641
So I can go all in
on new design and innovation.

01:29:10.225 --> 01:29:16.273
I have loved taking Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.237
From the website to retirements,
steering the market, everything.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.824
And there's so much more to come.

01:29:26.325 --> 01:29:29.620
We're headed for the best year ever!

01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:34.666
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:29:34.666 --> 01:29:38.921
- Enjoy the party!
- Ty! Ty!

01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:49.640
To think I actually believed him.

01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:52.935
I'm sorry it hurts, honey.

01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:56.939
Your problem is, you don't know
you're playing a rigged game.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:00.192
But if it's any comfort,

01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:04.279
at least you had the privilege
of believing in the first place.

01:30:09.576 --> 01:30:11.036
Oh, honey.

01:30:13.664 --> 01:30:15.666
You gotta come on a jump sometime.

01:30:17.668 --> 01:30:22.798
God, he looks terrible.
Look at the bags under his eyes.

01:30:24.883 --> 01:30:26.301
I've been looking for you, Maya.

01:30:28.637 --> 01:30:29.721
I've been right here.

01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:34.268
Don't be mad.

01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:35.853
Blaine's just a figurehead.

01:30:37.187 --> 01:30:40.566
You know you're always
my secret weapon. You know that.

01:30:44.695 --> 01:30:45.821
Look,

01:30:45.821 --> 01:30:47.614
I wanted to tell you, I'm...

01:30:50.033 --> 01:30:55.163
bumping you up to $20 an hour.
Twenty smackeroos.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:02.713
- I'm done, Ty. I'm through.
- What do you mean?

01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:08.010
I'm not your secret weapon. I'm
not a secret, and I'm not yours. I quit.

01:31:10.721 --> 01:31:11.722
Wanna dance?

01:31:11.722 --> 01:31:13.515
- Maya. Maya.
- Absolutely.

01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:14.600
Okay.

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:20.230
<i>I never imagined
just walking away from Ty.</i>

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:27.571
<i>But once you do, man, does it feel good.</i>

01:31:41.043 --> 01:31:46.423
<i>The thing about Ty is,
he draws you in, wins your trust.</i>

01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:55.724
<i>When things get bumpy, you just think
he's complicated, a little damaged.</i>

01:31:58.268 --> 01:31:59.895
<i>You wanna keep believing in him...</i>

01:32:03.148 --> 01:32:04.149
<i>until...</i>

01:32:07.736 --> 01:32:09.655
<i>you just can't anymore.</i>

01:32:25.504 --> 01:32:28.924
I mean, what's the big problem
with disillusionment, right?

01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:33.804
I mean, who wants to live
in "illusionment?" Not me.

01:32:34.471 --> 01:32:36.265
Hey, Maya. Have you seen Ty?

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.935
Oh, Sheila. Oh, no.

01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:45.983
I want so much better for you.
For all of us. It's--

01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:50.988
You okay, honey?

01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:54.157
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I will be.

01:32:54.783 --> 01:32:55.617
Yeah?

01:32:57.494 --> 01:32:59.538
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:04.918
Why did Ty change the Spooky tag?

01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:07.296
Is he--

01:33:08.338 --> 01:33:10.841
Is he so insecure
he had to take credit away from a child?

01:33:16.138 --> 01:33:20.809
You know, it's-- The funny thing is, like,
all the ones with the Ava tag

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:24.146
are worth way more
since he discontinued them.

01:33:24.146 --> 01:33:25.230
Like--

01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:29.860
But you know, it's not gonna matter
much longer, 'cause...

01:33:31.111 --> 01:33:32.112
What do you mean?

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:34.907
Well, I mean--

01:33:36.783 --> 01:33:37.784
Main bar.

01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:39.244
It's all gonna go...

01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:44.666
Okay, got a scotch and a chocolate milk?

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.918
Well, the scotch I can do,

01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:49.755
but we don't do a lot of chocolate milk,
so it'll take us--

01:33:50.714 --> 01:33:55.719
Yes, sir. Room 1433. We are on it.

01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:24.081
Did you order something?

01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:28.418
No. No, I did not.

01:34:31.672 --> 01:34:35.425
Okay. I'll tell them to get lost.

01:34:50.607 --> 01:34:51.775
You must be Sheila.

01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:55.988
I'm Robbie.

01:34:58.824 --> 01:35:01.076
Hey, did I tell you I bought a hotel?

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.330
I'm sorry this is how we're meeting.

01:35:08.834 --> 01:35:11.962
It doesn't mean anything, if that helps.

01:35:14.298 --> 01:35:16.049
I just like to show him who's boss.

01:35:35.777 --> 01:35:37.905
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:35:37.905 --> 01:35:40.157
You are making a huge mistake, Robbie.

01:35:40.782 --> 01:35:43.702
We-- I mean, we belong together.
Who's that?

01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:46.246
You followed me to Mexico.

01:35:48.123 --> 01:35:52.836
Of course I followed you. I'll follow you
anywhere. We belong together.

01:35:53.962 --> 01:35:58.467
No one will ever love you
the way that I do.

01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:02.012
Promise?

01:36:10.187 --> 01:36:11.271
Who was that?

01:36:12.564 --> 01:36:13.732
Sheila.

01:36:15.234 --> 01:36:16.235
She's lovely.

01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:21.490
No. No!

01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.909
What happened? What did you say to her?

01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:26.870
- Nothing, really.
- Okay, good. If I have her call you,

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:28.872
will you just say this was work?

01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.583
What did you think it was?

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.048
Robbie!

01:36:39.842 --> 01:36:44.137
You're fired, you hear me?
You get nothing! You get nothing, Robbie!

01:36:44.137 --> 01:36:45.639
You're dead to me!

01:36:47.432 --> 01:36:48.475
Robbie!

01:36:52.187 --> 01:36:53.230
Robbie!

01:36:54.398 --> 01:36:55.232
Wanna swim?

01:37:05.617 --> 01:37:06.618
Come on.

01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:12.791
Okay, Sheila. Listen.

01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:17.838
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Wha--

01:37:19.464 --> 01:37:22.259
My face. Oh, God.

01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:27.222
Oh, God.

01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:35.564
<i>President Clinton
asked noted educator Dr. Maya Angelou</i>

01:37:35.564 --> 01:37:39.443
<i>to compose a poem for this historic day.</i>

01:37:40.027 --> 01:37:42.696
<i>If we knew at the beginning
what we did by the end,</i>

01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:44.114
<i>would we do it all the same?</i>

01:37:44.114 --> 01:37:46.283
<i>...and Americans everywhere.</i>

01:37:46.283 --> 01:37:51.288
<i>A Rock, A River, A Tree</i>

01:37:51.288 --> 01:37:54.625
<i>Hosts to species long since departed...</i>

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.961
Who are you?

01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:00.547
Maya. New receptionist.

01:38:00.547 --> 01:38:05.260
I saw you on your way out a few weeks ago,
but we didn't get to meet.

01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:09.932
Well, welcome, new receptionist Maya.

01:38:09.932 --> 01:38:11.642
- Thank you.
- Let me ask you something.

01:38:12.768 --> 01:38:14.061
Do you stand up for yourself?

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.315
Yeah. Every day.

01:38:18.315 --> 01:38:19.858
Is Ty here?

01:38:19.858 --> 01:38:22.152
Yeah, and he's running
super late for an appointment,

01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:23.654
- so he should be leaving any second.
- Hey, out.

01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:25.656
- I'm just here to pick up...
- You're not welcome here.

01:38:25.656 --> 01:38:28.450
- ...the rest of my things. No, I--
- Get out. Out!

01:38:29.743 --> 01:38:33.622
- Did you get a face-lift? You didn't.
- Don't touch my face.

01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:36.792
Do not touch my face. Out, please.

01:38:37.376 --> 01:38:41.839
I should tell you, the foreign
expansion plan, it was a terrible idea.

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:43.215
The UK is a disaster.

01:38:43.215 --> 01:38:46.385
Oh, no. Don't tell me your door-to-door
preachers aren't working out?

01:38:46.385 --> 01:38:48.637
Don't give me that.
You raved about the idea.

01:38:48.637 --> 01:38:51.390
You said it was brilliant.
You said it was genius.

01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:54.393
I don't recall saying that. Not to you.

01:38:57.938 --> 01:38:59.982
You're a fraud.

01:38:59.982 --> 01:39:03.777
And I will never, ever,
ever talk to you again. Ever!

01:39:04.653 --> 01:39:06.071
Aren't you late?

01:39:06.071 --> 01:39:08.907
I'm the one asking you to leave.
I'm asking you to get out.

01:39:08.907 --> 01:39:09.992
Could we have security?

01:39:09.992 --> 01:39:11.952
Your assistant said
you're late for an appointment.

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.538
Ty Inc. How can I help you?

01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.915
<i>This is Sheila Harper
from Oak Brook Lighting.</i>

01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:19.418
<i>I'm at Mr. Warner's new residence
for our meeting.</i>

01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:22.546
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
He's obviously running really late.

01:39:23.463 --> 01:39:25.716
He's in the middle of something right now.

01:39:25.716 --> 01:39:28.302
Well, I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

01:39:28.302 --> 01:39:31.138
Honestly, if I were you, I'd just bail.

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:36.810
<i>But we didn't bail. We leaned in.</i>

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.609
Are we sure
we don't have any other options?

01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:46.236
I'm kinda new here, Ty.

01:39:47.279 --> 01:39:48.739
It's such a mess over there.

01:39:50.741 --> 01:39:51.992
God, I hate this!

01:39:53.118 --> 01:39:54.328
Okay, dial for me, please.

01:39:54.328 --> 01:39:55.412
Yep.

01:40:00.542 --> 01:40:01.543
Shut the door.

01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:07.633
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Roberta.

01:40:08.217 --> 01:40:11.678
Well, look what the understuffed
posable cat dragged in.

01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:14.223
I think you know why I'm calling.

01:40:14.223 --> 01:40:18.143
Listen, I need you to come back and
help me out. I need you to fix the UK.

01:40:19.353 --> 01:40:20.354
No.

01:40:20.354 --> 01:40:23.732
Okay. Robbie, please,
I really just need you, okay?

01:40:24.316 --> 01:40:25.984
Why would you need me, Ty?

01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:31.823
Because I can't do it without you.

01:40:33.116 --> 01:40:34.451
<i>I'm sorry, what was that?</i>

01:40:34.451 --> 01:40:37.079
"I can't do it without you,"
is what I said.

01:40:37.079 --> 01:40:39.706
No fucking shit.

01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.210
But the answer's still no.

01:40:43.210 --> 01:40:46.088
<i>What? Why? Why?</i>

01:40:46.588 --> 01:40:50.717
Because I'll never, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever work for you again, Ty. Ever.

01:40:51.802 --> 01:40:53.178
But you can work for me.

01:40:55.138 --> 01:40:58.308
- What are you talking about?
- <i>I'm starting my own company.</i>

01:40:58.308 --> 01:40:59.810
And it happens to be available

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:03.313
to be the exclusive wholesaler
of Ty products in the UK.

01:41:04.982 --> 01:41:07.818
Wait, are you being--
Is this-- Are you being serious?

01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:13.699
Deadly. You want me to fix the UK?
Those are my terms. I run the UK.

01:41:16.201 --> 01:41:18.161
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on hold for two seconds.

01:41:18.662 --> 01:41:20.080
God Almighty!

01:41:24.793 --> 01:41:25.794
God!

01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:31.592
Okay, just get it fixed.

01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:34.136
I will. Nice doing business with you, Ty.

01:41:34.136 --> 01:41:35.429
Shut up.

01:41:38.724 --> 01:41:40.184
<i>He got one thing right.</i>

01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:46.273
<i>You gotta build your own fucking ship.</i>

01:41:47.774 --> 01:41:48.901
<i>So I did.</i>

01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:54.031
<i>We all did. And not a minute too soon.</i>

01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:59.786
<i>The Beanie market
has crashed spectacularly.</i>

01:41:59.786 --> 01:42:03.498
<i>From gold to garbage.
The Beanie Baby bubble has popped.</i>

01:42:04.374 --> 01:42:06.502
A veritable Beanie Baby apocalypse.

01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:10.214
<i>By the end of '99, all that money,</i>

01:42:10.214 --> 01:42:15.010
<i>$20 billion worth of Beanie wealth, evaporated.</i>

01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:21.308
<i>That's the whole point of America, right?</i>

01:42:21.308 --> 01:42:24.436
<i>Everybody chasing something
too good to be true.</i>

01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:32.402
<i>And there's always another hustle.</i>

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.865
<i>Always a next new thing.</i>

01:42:40.202 --> 01:42:41.954
<i>There's always another player.</i>

01:42:44.414 --> 01:42:47.125
<i>What you gotta do is beat the game.</i>

01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:48.210
Maya-<i>san</i>...

01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:52.881
We'd like to discuss something with you.
This card will be a big hit.

01:42:53.966 --> 01:42:55.592
So these are our "Pokemans"?

01:42:55.592 --> 01:42:56.885
Pokémons.

01:42:56.885 --> 01:42:58.178
- Pokémon.
- What?

01:42:58.178 --> 01:42:59.555
- Pokémon.
- Just Pokémon.

01:43:00.055 --> 01:43:01.557
- Just Pokémon.
- Pokémon. Okay.

01:43:01.557 --> 01:43:03.684
Just keep on poking them on.

01:43:05.102 --> 01:43:09.606
It's so, so gorgeous here. And warm.

01:43:10.941 --> 01:43:12.109
You should come visit.

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.945
<i>And you really think
you're there for good?</i>

01:43:14.945 --> 01:43:16.780
Oh, yeah. I mean, Ava's Spookies,

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:23.287
they paid for the whole house and the car
and both girls' school through college.

01:43:23.287 --> 01:43:24.997
- <i>Oh, Jesus.</i>
- Uh-huh.

01:43:24.997 --> 01:43:27.082
- <i>Seconds before the crash.</i>
- Uh-huh.

01:43:27.624 --> 01:43:29.877
<i>You really did get out just in time.</i>

01:43:30.502 --> 01:43:31.628
In so many ways.

01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:35.507
<i>You sound happy. For real.</i>

01:43:36.008 --> 01:43:38.635
I am. You know, I really am. I--

01:43:39.178 --> 01:43:40.846
Do you know I realized
what the problem was.

01:43:40.846 --> 01:43:42.931
It wasn't relying on the wrong man.

01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:46.143
It was, I don't know,
having the wrong man rely on us.
