00:23.976 --> 00:27.564
Hello. Sorry.
Decaf oat milk flat white, please.

00:28.106 --> 00:30.232
- Thanks.
- Your baby's well cute.

00:31.026 --> 00:32.569
Thank you.

00:36.155 --> 00:38.574
And one of those, please.

00:38.657 --> 00:40.326
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

00:49.335 --> 00:50.295
Where is she?

00:50.629 --> 00:53.506
What? No.
You tell me where she is.

00:53.589 --> 00:56.092
Do you do this on purpose
'cause, honestly, I can't tell.

00:56.176 --> 00:57.260
Excuse me?

00:57.343 --> 01:01.723
We are meant to be on stage in 45
minutes for the "Illusionists" audition,

01:01.807 --> 01:03.141
and she won't pick up her phone.

01:03.225 --> 01:06.353
Yeah? Well, she's just taken
a baby from my flat.

01:06.435 --> 01:09.022
- She's gone West!
- What do you expect?

01:09.106 --> 01:11.858
You appear out of nowhere
with an elderly girlfriend,

01:11.941 --> 01:13.234
dangle a baby in front of her,

01:13.318 --> 01:15.654
and then disappear without
a word of explanation.

01:15.737 --> 01:19.366
And now I'm somehow meant to perform
the Assistant's Revenge trick

01:19.449 --> 01:20.701
without a fucking assistant!

01:20.784 --> 01:21.743
She's skiving your audition.

01:22.368 --> 01:24.204
Maybe it's 'cause she's
finally got wind of the fact

01:24.288 --> 01:26.706
that you're just usin' her
to get your spandexed arse paid.

01:26.789 --> 01:30.710
Good luck getting the producer to put
your sparkly cameltoe on a poster.

01:30.793 --> 01:32.670
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Fuck you!

01:32.753 --> 01:34.047
Fuck you!

01:38.302 --> 01:41.095
Pick up, Bobbi!
Where are you?

01:41.555 --> 01:44.182
What you playing at?
Call me back, now!

01:55.485 --> 01:57.195
"Gone to Mum's...

01:57.903 --> 02:02.200
"bumblebee, love-heart,
rainbow, shooting-star"? Bobbi!

02:07.039 --> 02:08.998
Welcome to Jupiter House!

02:09.373 --> 02:11.834
We're going to have so much fun.

02:13.419 --> 02:15.338
Wanna see my favorite spot?

02:18.215 --> 02:23.137
I know exactly what Bobbi's playing at.
We go in, we get the baby, and we leave.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.682
I'm not saying
one word to that woman.

02:26.725 --> 02:28.977
When did you last see your mother?

02:30.728 --> 02:33.899
My gran's funeral, about 15 years ago.

02:35.316 --> 02:40.112
She tried to lead a gratitude circle,
and I told her she's a narcissist.

02:40.197 --> 02:42.991
She lives in this whack commune.

02:43.074 --> 02:46.494
The whole place smells
of nag champa and chicken shit.

02:48.871 --> 02:50.165
Okay...

02:53.126 --> 02:56.587
Bobbi, I swear to god,
I'm gonna fucking kill her.

02:59.173 --> 03:01.092
What if he tries to hurt her?

03:02.177 --> 03:04.095
Should've killed him
when you had a chance.

03:04.179 --> 03:06.305
He's trying to send you a message.

03:08.808 --> 03:10.102
What message?

03:12.728 --> 03:15.356
Shit.
I know where they are.

03:38.045 --> 03:39.589
Bobbi!

03:41.757 --> 03:43.259
Bobbi!

03:51.600 --> 03:53.853
Sorry... went down
the wrong way.

03:55.021 --> 03:57.565
What the fuck...
were you thinkin'?

03:59.526 --> 04:01.194
You said I could help.

04:01.861 --> 04:04.448
And you seemed a bit stressed.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.742
And you thought coming here...

04:07.284 --> 04:09.160
was the solution to that?

04:11.163 --> 04:15.459
I thought it could be good for you,
and Mum hasn't met him yet.

04:16.418 --> 04:20.171
- This is the last place I need to be.
- Natasha, slow down.

04:20.714 --> 04:24.383
Natasha... stop running away from me.

04:25.092 --> 04:28.721
I'm worried about you.
I just want to know that you're okay.

04:28.805 --> 04:30.432
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

04:30.515 --> 04:33.225
No, you're not.
You're terrified.

04:34.518 --> 04:37.564
Something's really wrong.
Just... talk to me.

04:44.655 --> 04:45.863
He's not my baby.

04:46.697 --> 04:49.618
He fell off a cliff...
and I caught him.

04:50.409 --> 04:52.244
And now, I can't get rid of him.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.247
He's dangerous, Bob.

04:55.791 --> 04:59.002
And if you try and take him...
he'll kill you.

05:05.675 --> 05:09.136
I'd forgotten how mean you are.

05:35.872 --> 05:37.415
Is your sister okay?

05:39.084 --> 05:43.671
She's fabulous. She's gonna stick around
and play happy families with my mum.

05:43.755 --> 05:45.214
Let's go.

05:53.682 --> 05:55.309
Jesus.

06:01.522 --> 06:03.442
He's trying to keep us here.

06:04.359 --> 06:05.818
Why?

06:44.857 --> 06:47.486
Someone will come
and take a look at the car.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.196
Might take a while.

06:52.156 --> 06:55.369
You and your friend
can wait in the house if you like.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.246
I know you didn't
come here to see me...

06:59.330 --> 07:02.042
so I'll do my best
to stay outta your way.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.586
Bobbi told me about this one.

07:10.842 --> 07:13.971
You were exactly the same.
Could never get you to settle.

07:18.141 --> 07:21.602
I'll make a bed up for you
in case you need to stay.

07:26.357 --> 07:27.651
Is there a lake here?

07:28.651 --> 07:31.863
- Yeah.
- Good... we'll do it there.

07:35.325 --> 07:36.952
Why're you doing this?

07:38.203 --> 07:42.833
- I'm trying to save your life.
- No. Tell me who you are to him.

07:43.542 --> 07:46.377
Tell me why someone would
spend 50 years livin' in a car,

07:46.461 --> 07:48.547
eatin' rank-ass apple pies.

07:49.214 --> 07:53.593
'Cause right now, all I see is a batty old
lady telling me to throw a baby in a lake,

07:53.676 --> 07:56.429
and to be honest, I'm not feelin' it.

08:00.057 --> 08:02.601
Nothing?!
Okay, fuck this.

08:02.935 --> 08:06.439
Whatever your plan is...
clearly isn't working.

08:08.524 --> 08:10.986
Where are you going,
you stupid girl?

08:14.071 --> 08:15.823
Don't walk away. We're so close.

08:15.906 --> 08:18.201
If you don't wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on with him,

08:18.285 --> 08:20.077
I'll figure it
out for myself.

08:20.162 --> 08:22.413
You'll be dead
this time tomorrow.

08:22.496 --> 08:25.207
I'll be following
some other stupid girl.

08:26.584 --> 08:27.877
Stupid girl!

08:41.515 --> 08:43.769
What do you want?
Are you hungry?

08:45.312 --> 08:47.356
Bloody hell, you're a unit.

08:47.981 --> 08:51.068
What d'ya want?
Maybe you can give me a break, yeah?

08:58.324 --> 09:01.286
Get you some food,
keep our heads down,

09:01.369 --> 09:03.622
then find a way out, all right?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Hi, Ma!

09:08.835 --> 09:12.797
Honey says the cider's ready for tonight,
if you wanna try it.

09:13.589 --> 09:15.467
Precious Bobbi!

09:21.931 --> 09:24.141
I am so happy they're here.

09:25.894 --> 09:29.480
- And I'm so happy you're here, too.
- Yeah...

09:36.153 --> 09:39.949
You've become an Aunt...
and I've become an Elder.

09:42.410 --> 09:46.414
So, whatever the circumstances,
that's a blessing, isn't it?

09:50.334 --> 09:52.504
Now, pump up
your bed, will ya?

09:54.505 --> 09:55.757
This is my bed.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.718
- Oh, Bobbi.
- Right.

09:58.635 --> 10:00.554
- I'll see ya at dinner.
- Yeah.

10:10.105 --> 10:11.439
Come on.

10:13.734 --> 10:14.984
Come on.

10:17.611 --> 10:20.407
He's crying
'cause you're tired.

10:20.490 --> 10:23.200
You need to sleep,
he needs to cry it out.

10:25.078 --> 10:29.457
Hello, I'm Honey.
And you must be Natasha.

10:30.584 --> 10:33.252
And this must be your lovely baby.

10:34.378 --> 10:38.174
You've caught us in the middle
of slightly glorious chaos.

10:38.634 --> 10:41.345
Gosh, they are wonderful
at that age, aren't they?

10:41.427 --> 10:44.389
- Do you do skin-on-skin?
- What?

10:45.890 --> 10:51.021
You put them just here, on your chest,
until your heartbeats are in sync.

10:51.479 --> 10:55.567
The bodily connection between a mother
and her child is quite extraordinary.

10:56.109 --> 10:57.152
Right.

10:57.234 --> 10:59.320
Are you staying
for the Solstice tonight?

10:59.403 --> 11:01.530
- Sadly not.
- Oh, you must!

11:07.079 --> 11:11.415
Maybe, if we're very kind to Bobbi,
she'll give us a magic trick.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.211
Then, it's all hands
on deck for the bonfire.

11:14.293 --> 11:16.212
Alright, alright, alright.

11:16.672 --> 11:20.383
- What... have I got here?
- Chocolate coins!

11:20.467 --> 11:23.887
Now, I need all of you
to concentrate really hard

11:23.971 --> 11:26.263
on getting these coins
into that bowl.

11:26.848 --> 11:28.016
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:28.433 --> 11:30.559
Three, two, one.

11:34.439 --> 11:36.440
Where did they go?

11:37.693 --> 11:39.403
Guess it didn't work.

11:40.486 --> 11:41.822
Unless...

11:42.406 --> 11:43.657
Check your pockets.

11:44.407 --> 11:45.993
Chocolate coin!

11:50.831 --> 11:54.209
Okay, everyone, chocolate
in the treat cupboard.

11:56.377 --> 11:58.171
But Bob just gave 'em the coins.

11:58.255 --> 12:01.300
Processed sugar makes our teeth
go black and fall out.

12:01.383 --> 12:02.592
It's fine, Tash.

12:03.218 --> 12:05.094
Why don't you have a baby?

12:06.262 --> 12:08.139
Is it because you're a lesbian?

12:10.934 --> 12:13.937
We encourage the children
to be curious and open,

12:14.021 --> 12:17.065
and we respond in the spirit
of radical honesty.

12:20.776 --> 12:24.489
My partner and I, decided that

12:25.157 --> 12:28.535
having a, a biological
baby wasn't...

12:29.744 --> 12:31.788
'cause... pregnancy...

12:31.872 --> 12:34.415
Processed sugar
won't turn your teeth black.

12:34.499 --> 12:38.795
I ate sweets all the time
when I was a kid. I've got lovely teeth.

12:39.463 --> 12:43.674
- Time to go down to the bonfire.
- But I want my chocolate coin!

12:44.009 --> 12:45.302
Jacob...

12:46.470 --> 12:52.850
at Jupiter House,
we don't raise our voices in anger.

12:52.933 --> 12:58.147
- We only raise them in joy.
- Only in joy.

12:58.689 --> 13:01.442
Now... go and help the others.
Come on.

13:02.985 --> 13:05.030
No more chocolate coins, Bobbi.

13:12.037 --> 13:14.915
You just can't help yourself, can you?

13:17.793 --> 13:19.711
This fucking place.

13:21.879 --> 13:24.382
Natasha?
Can I have a cigarette?

13:25.759 --> 13:27.177
What?

13:27.803 --> 13:30.096
I'll show you Barbara's workshop.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.349
It's where she goes when
she's having a meltdown.

13:44.403 --> 13:46.571
No one's allowed in here.

14:02.712 --> 14:04.548
Can I have
a cigarette now?

14:14.641 --> 14:19.688
All right, don't smoke in front of anyone
until you can inhale without coughing.

14:21.273 --> 14:23.524
Always use these two fingers.

14:23.608 --> 14:27.154
Never these two,
unless you wanna look like a twat.

14:27.237 --> 14:30.948
And if someone asks you for a cigarette,
always say yes.

14:31.033 --> 14:35.078
Unless it's your last one,
in which case you'll say you'll twos it.

14:35.161 --> 14:36.954
What's twos it?

14:38.040 --> 14:39.666
Never mind.

14:56.558 --> 14:57.893
Hello.

14:59.478 --> 15:00.854
What do you want?

15:04.982 --> 15:07.653
She needs you to put
the baby to sleep again.

15:07.735 --> 15:10.071
You're the only
person who can do it.

15:11.156 --> 15:13.324
It's classic Natasha, isn't it?

15:13.824 --> 15:16.077
It's like tryin' to love a clam.

15:16.161 --> 15:17.119
Totally.

15:18.997 --> 15:22.083
Who exactly are you? You.

15:22.793 --> 15:25.461
'Cause I know you're
not her yoga teacher.

15:26.421 --> 15:28.674
I'm helping her out with the baby.

15:34.679 --> 15:39.101
You can tell her if she wants my help,
she can ask for it herself.

16:05.669 --> 16:07.420
What happened to you?

16:23.770 --> 16:28.608
There's a box of your old baby clothes
in the guest room. Got 'em out for Bobbi.

16:28.941 --> 16:31.110
Probably more useful for you.

16:32.945 --> 16:38.284
- Doting grandmother doesn't suit you.
- Well, reluctant mother doesn't suit you.

16:40.161 --> 16:42.539
You don't have anything to prove.

16:43.874 --> 16:47.210
Well, least of all to me.

16:49.046 --> 16:50.588
Was it worth it then?

16:51.213 --> 16:54.091
To go and live in a field,
and make little clay people?

16:54.176 --> 16:55.885
Well, you tell me.

16:55.969 --> 16:58.888
Has havin' a baby fixed
the hole in your soul?

17:05.103 --> 17:07.480
Why did you come here, Natasha?

17:20.744 --> 17:22.788
These are shit, by the way.

17:28.751 --> 17:30.586
Don't fucking start.

17:41.223 --> 17:46.727
What do you want?
What do you want?

17:57.155 --> 18:00.199
What do you want?
What do you want?

18:00.867 --> 18:02.493
What do you want?!

18:03.327 --> 18:05.705
What do you want?
What do you want?

18:06.747 --> 18:08.125
What do you want?!

18:08.499 --> 18:09.960
What do you want?!

18:10.294 --> 18:11.919
What do you fucking well want?!

18:12.004 --> 18:15.173
What do you want?!
Just tell me what you want!

18:15.256 --> 18:16.882
What do you want?!

18:21.221 --> 18:24.223
Get some sleep...
Come on.

18:24.932 --> 18:26.893
He doesn't let me sleep.

18:29.437 --> 18:31.023
Let him cry.

18:40.823 --> 18:43.618
Come down to the feast
when you're ready.

18:52.002 --> 18:53.962
Why did you bring me here?

19:14.650 --> 19:20.322
As you all know, Summer Solstice
is my favorite night of the year.

19:20.696 --> 19:24.950
Yeah. It's a celebration of the Dark Womb

19:25.493 --> 19:28.871
from whom we emerge
and to whom we return.

19:36.379 --> 19:38.590
But on Solstice night,

19:38.673 --> 19:40.467
we recognize

19:41.050 --> 19:42.134
the light within us,

19:42.719 --> 19:47.014
that we may see clearly
what's been asked of us.

19:47.390 --> 19:52.396
So that we can be the best
we possibly can... for each other.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.063
Yes!

19:54.146 --> 19:56.066
And this year's Solstice...

19:57.191 --> 19:58.776
is a special one...

20:00.069 --> 20:04.323
because I have both
my daughters

20:04.866 --> 20:06.659
under the same roof.

20:07.244 --> 20:09.203
And a grandchild!

20:13.874 --> 20:17.671
So, let's dedicate
this year's Solstice...

20:19.130 --> 20:21.049
