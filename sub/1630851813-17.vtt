investigation discovered

08:02.351 --> 08:03.526
that someone's using the auction

08:03.570 --> 08:04.788
to launder money
for the Becerra Cartel.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.312
Becerra's the new guy
in town.

He's trying to take over
Serano's old territory.

his money laundering hub.

who's facilitating

and stop them,

there's even a whisper

34:05.260 --> 34:08.307
These two legends
were so loud

34:08.350 --> 34:11.179
that Dan changed
the name of our Wi-Fi

34:11.223 --> 34:13.094
to "We Can Hear You."[laughs]

34:13.138 --> 34:15.923
And the old lady Agnes
changes hers that night

34:15.966 --> 34:17.751
to "Yeah? What's Your Point?"

34:17.794 --> 34:19.448
No! Oh, my gosh.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.625
They're at least 80 years old.
[laughing]Wow.

34:22.669 --> 34:25.063
Well, I will drink to that.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.239
Yeah. Amen, sister.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.807
That was, you know...

34:30.851 --> 34:32.635
No, no.
It's-it's actually

34:32.679 --> 34:34.898
very nice to hear.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.552
Cheers.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.033
Cheers.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.691
I do have to say
there have been

34:44.734 --> 34:46.954
a lot of times in my life

34:46.997 --> 34:49.609
that I would have loved
a shoulder to cry on.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.219
Wait, don't get me wrong.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.134
Mom has her good qualities.Mm.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.657
[laughs]
Mm-hmm.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.051
But something tells me that

34:57.095 --> 35:00.098
you're probably
a better listener.Well, thank you.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.318
And I want you to remember

35:03.362 --> 35:06.147
that now you do have a shoulder.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.801
I mean a third.[laughs]

35:07.844 --> 35:09.672
Oh, hell, that came out wrong.

35:09.716 --> 35:12.110
No. It's nice to hear.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.509
I'm gonna do it.
It's gonna happen.

35:20.553 --> 35:23.251
It's time. It's time!

35:24.209 --> 35:26.559
What are you doing?

35:26.602 --> 35:30.084
Today's the day that
good ol' Denise the Deer

35:30.128 --> 35:32.260
comes down.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.045
Okay, well, first of all,
that's a boar,

35:35.089 --> 35:36.525
not a deer;
I'm not that drunk.

35:36.569 --> 35:40.094
Well, whatever it is,
it's coming down.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.443
What-- Wait, wait.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.010
Wasn't that a present
from Emily Walker?

35:43.053 --> 35:44.881
Yes, it was.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.362
And she would want you
to feel welcome.

35:47.406 --> 35:48.624
So do I.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.974
Thank you.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.716
Hey, Louis?Mm-hmm?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.762
Can you put this
in storage for me?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.894
Thank you.Got it, Geri. Yeah.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.204
Last call?

36:03.248 --> 36:04.466
Um...

36:08.035 --> 36:10.342
Oop![laughs]

36:13.780 --> 36:17.262
To family.To blood.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.704
[knock on door]

36:24.747 --> 36:26.184
Hey, hey, hey.Hey.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.098
Come on in.
What's up?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.927
I just wanted to come
let you know that I...

36:30.971 --> 36:32.494
I've come to a decision.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.496
Okay. And?

36:36.019 --> 36:38.239
I still got work to do
at the school.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.893
I see.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.983
But I have a proposition
for you.

36:44.593 --> 36:45.986
All right.
I'm all ears.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.509
I owe it to these seniors

36:47.553 --> 36:49.816
to see them through to
the end of the school year.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.252
They've worked hard,

36:51.296 --> 36:53.341
and I want to see them
get their diplomas.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.562
But after that,
when the summer hits,

36:56.605 --> 36:58.651
I'll join up here.

36:58.694 --> 37:01.393
Full-fledged.
Really?

37:02.959 --> 37:05.005
I'll talk to the DPS
commission.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.659
Yeah?
School's almost out.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.269
Seems reasonable to me, right?

37:08.313 --> 37:11.403
Yeah.
Thank you, Cap.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.666
I appreciate it.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.015
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.756
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.106
My man.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.646
Hey, Bill, it's Captain James.

37:37.690 --> 37:41.346
Listen, we're probably gonna
have to pull some strings,

37:41.389 --> 37:43.130
but I just found
the perfect candidate

37:43.173 --> 37:45.872
for the open Ranger position
that we need to fill.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.354
Yeah. All right, we'll talk.

37:56.230 --> 37:59.320
Hey, that's my parking spot.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.931
What, this a reenactment
of when we first met?

38:01.975 --> 38:03.368
[chuckles]
Oh, do you--

38:03.411 --> 38:05.108
Do you not want
August to sucker punch you?

38:05.152 --> 38:07.546
No, I definitely
don't need that.

38:08.895 --> 38:11.114
So, um, what's up?

38:11.158 --> 38:13.856
It's over between me and Todd.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.206
Are you okay?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.208
Yeah.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.385
Yeah?

38:20.428 --> 38:21.951
Yeah.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.389
Okay.
So...

38:24.432 --> 38:27.000
it seems like our families
have stopped fighting.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.350
My gramps is working
with your dad.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.526
Our grandmas aren't throwing
chili at each other.

38:31.570 --> 38:35.922
And we can both sort of
call Geri our aunt now.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.967
That's weird.
Mm-hmm.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.621
Yeah. So, um,

38:39.665 --> 38:44.713
how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

38:44.757 --> 38:46.933
Probably not forever, sadly.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.067
But that doesn't really
matter to us.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.939
Right?[chuckles]

38:54.941 --> 38:57.987
Uh, I really like you, Stella.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.468
I really like you, too.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.095

Hey.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.576
Look at you, breaking
and entering again.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.926
[laughs]

39:23.970 --> 39:27.408
Hey, how did, uh...
how did yesterday go?

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
It was great, actually.Good.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.544
Ben thinks picnics should
stay in the 1950s...

39:32.587 --> 39:34.284
Oh......but we stayed in,
ordered ramen.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.373
Okay.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.984
Well, you-you love ramen.
Lucky you.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.769
I love ramen.
[laughing]:
You love ramen.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.684
Yeah. So how'd it go
with Twyla?

39:42.728 --> 39:46.645
Uh, she asked to be transferred
to the next county over.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.430
Oh, man, I'm-I'm sorry.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.736
No, don't be.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.346
You were right about me.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.436
About who I am.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.180
When I was with Twyla,

40:00.223 --> 40:02.922
I was able to forget
about everything

40:02.965 --> 40:07.666
because I was literally
pretending to be someone else.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.538
Duke.
But that's another life.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.889
You know, one without
responsibilities, uh,

40:13.933 --> 40:17.066
or attachments.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.374
Definitely not mine.

40:20.418 --> 40:24.857
Someone would have to pry
this family away from me

40:24.900 --> 40:30.166
for me to ever walk away
from it again.

40:30.210 --> 40:35.084
And, uh, if-- or when--

40:35.128 --> 40:37.391
the feeling does come up

40:37.435 --> 40:40.133
where you need
to follow your heart,

40:40.176 --> 40:42.527
I volunteer to take you
to the airport.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.355
[laughs]
To make sure that
you board that plane.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.880
Okay.
I will buy you
that ticket.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.011
Yeah, fair enough.Okay?

40:49.055 --> 40:50.752
I know you will.
I know you will.

40:50.796 --> 40:51.927
Twyla said something else.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.190
She mentioned something,
and it...

40:54.234 --> 40:57.150
I can't stop thinking
about it.

40:57.193 --> 41:00.240
What? What'd she say?

41:02.024 --> 41:03.852
She asked about the-the race.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.854
The race for the ranch.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.247
She couldn't believe
I lost.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.945
And the truth is,
I can't believe

41:09.989 --> 41:12.382
I lost, either.

41:12.426 --> 41:15.037
I mean, Dan's a good--
a good rider, he is.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.126
But something happened
at this horse auction

41:17.170 --> 41:18.388
I had to go to for work.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.434
I-I watched a rider
take a tumble

41:20.478 --> 41:23.916
because his saddle
wasn't secured properly.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.309
[exhales]
Let me ask you this.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.660
So-so Daddy's been working
with leather

41:28.703 --> 41:30.836
basically his whole life,
right?

41:30.879 --> 41:32.881
Right.

41:32.925 --> 41:37.451
How many of his straps
have snapped?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.757
None.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.062
Exactly. None.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.064
So what are the odds
that, on the day

41:42.108 --> 41:44.458
I'm supposed to race
for our family's legacy,

41:44.502 --> 41:47.026
the leather gives out?

41:49.028 --> 41:51.900
Cordell, what are you saying?

41:51.944 --> 41:55.556
I'm saying, the Davidsons...

41:55.600 --> 41:56.949
what if they cheated?
