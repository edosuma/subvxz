00:11.489 --> 00:14.884
â™ª

00:14.927 --> 00:16.712
[clears throat]

00:16.755 --> 00:17.713
Oh.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.671
Hi. Morning.

00:19.715 --> 00:20.672
Hey.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.673
You, uh,

00:21.717 --> 00:22.892
breaking and entering?

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
[chuckles] Hey, have you seen

00:24.589 --> 00:25.808
Dad's old picnic basket?

00:25.851 --> 00:28.724
I've got this date
tonight.
His what?

00:28.767 --> 00:31.205
Are you going to court today?

00:31.248 --> 00:32.293
No.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.642
What's with all the starch?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.035
Uh...

00:35.078 --> 00:36.166
Are you wearing aftershave?

00:36.210 --> 00:37.341
Look, okay.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.083
Ugh.
If you must know,
I'm, uh,

00:40.127 --> 00:41.693
taking Twyla around today.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.218
Gonna go help her find a new
apartment. It's not a big deal.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.002
Twyla?Yeah.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.264
You sure that's smart?[laughs]

00:47.308 --> 00:49.266
Easy.
We're just running errands.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.442
Does Geri know?

00:51.486 --> 00:52.922
Look, I know
it's a rebound, but...

00:52.965 --> 00:55.533
Okay, Geri made it clear
she's not interested in

00:55.577 --> 00:58.145
us. And-and Twyla...

00:58.188 --> 01:00.190
Twyla's not
a rebound.

01:00.234 --> 01:03.237
She's a friend. You know,
it-it's-it's casual.
Uh...

01:03.280 --> 01:06.457
Cordi, you don't do
casual. Okay?

01:06.501 --> 01:07.676
You're a serial
monogamist.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.461
Okay, so, wait,
are there rules?

01:10.505 --> 01:12.420
Mm.
What? Was-was I supposed
to go straight from

01:12.463 --> 01:14.204
widower to player?

01:14.248 --> 01:16.467
Also,
you have coffee

01:16.511 --> 01:18.208
with a guy
and get engaged, so...

01:18.252 --> 01:19.296
Uh, no.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.472
Bret and I
got engaged

01:21.516 --> 01:23.822
after six months
of dating, okay?

01:23.866 --> 01:25.955
So... And it wasn't coffee.

01:25.998 --> 01:29.089
Okay, okay, okay. I just...

01:29.132 --> 01:32.353
Look, there's something simple
about it, w-with Twyla.

01:32.396 --> 01:35.007
I don't have to think
about me losing the ranch,

01:35.051 --> 01:37.575
or me and Geri,
or-or us all fighting

01:37.619 --> 01:38.924
with the Davidsons, any of it.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.362
All I can say
is that when

01:41.405 --> 01:42.754
I'm with her, I-I feel like

01:42.798 --> 01:44.582
I can take a breath.Cordi,

01:44.626 --> 01:46.106
if you need to talk to me,

01:46.149 --> 01:47.629
you know that
I'm always here, right?

01:47.672 --> 01:50.501
I do know that. I do. Uh...

01:50.545 --> 01:51.894
Thank you.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.593
Meanwhile, big brother
to the rescue.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.855
VoilÃ .

01:56.899 --> 01:59.206
[exhales]Daddy's picnic basket.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.645
Hey. Have fun.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.475
Thanks.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.781
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

02:16.005 --> 02:17.789
[exhales]

02:19.835 --> 02:21.445
Wearing Mom's necklace again?

02:21.489 --> 02:25.014
Yeah, um... Colton found it.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.279
You got to
tell Todd.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.889
What?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.891
Come on, you said Colton's name,
and you did that thing

02:32.935 --> 02:36.199
you do with your-your face,
your cheeks or whatever.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.287
Smile?

02:37.331 --> 02:39.159
You don't smile
like that at Todd.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.682
I smile how I smile.
This is just

02:40.725 --> 02:42.597
the way my face moves.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.165
It's not fair, to either of you.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.820
I know.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.083
It's just... it's not that easy.

02:51.127 --> 02:54.261
Just rip it off,
like a Band-Aid.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.051
Good luck.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.971
Hey, um, can we talk at lunch?

03:09.014 --> 03:11.234
Sure. Great news.Sauber.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.322
I got in.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.282
[laughs]Oh, okay. [laughs]

03:15.325 --> 03:16.500
Oh, wow.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.546
All the cram sessions,
late nights,

03:18.589 --> 03:19.895
it all paid off.
Thanks to you.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.114
I was getting worried
about the whole

03:22.158 --> 03:25.248
long-distance thing,
but now we're all good.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.644
Sorry, I-I interrupted you.
What'd you want to say?

03:29.687 --> 03:31.211
Um...

03:32.777 --> 03:35.519
Don't worry about it.
Let's celebrate.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.391
Come on.Okay.

03:37.434 --> 03:38.870
[grunting]

03:38.914 --> 03:42.134
Nice. Real nice.
[panting]

03:42.178 --> 03:43.397
So, it sounds like
things are going

03:43.440 --> 03:44.485
well with you and your brother.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.313
Yeah, well, we're getting there.

03:46.356 --> 03:50.491
Yeah?
We, uh, we visited
Lucas's grave last week.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.406
It was healing.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.495
That's-that's great.
That's great, but I...

03:54.538 --> 03:57.715
I hope you guys are doing some
lighter things together, too.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.022
[laughs] Yeah.
Yeah, of course. I mean,

04:00.065 --> 04:01.763
we're actually going
to a Neville Meriwether

04:01.806 --> 04:03.286
book signing next week.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.679
Who's that?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.028
Seriously?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.812
He's a British Academy actor

04:07.856 --> 04:10.859
who portrays the fearless fowl
himself, Hawk Shadow.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.078
What?
I...

04:13.122 --> 04:14.254
Caw.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.385
Caw? What?

04:15.429 --> 04:17.822
[shouts, grunting]

04:18.910 --> 04:21.609
Okay, well,
other than this deeply

04:21.652 --> 04:23.611
disappointing finish...Whoo.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.048
...this was a good session.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.919
Yeah, that was, that was good.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.748
[Cassie exhales]

04:30.792 --> 04:33.490
Ah, Cap. Hey.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.752
How's it going, man?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.754
Uh, it's...
it's good.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.408
We're making some progress.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.757
But I got to tell you,

04:39.801 --> 04:41.106
you Rangers are not
a talkative bunch.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.982
Oh, you doing the

04:47.025 --> 04:48.592
not talking thing. Yeah.I was doing the thing, yeah.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.680
Yeah, you got a second?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.726
Yeah.
Got some news for you.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.076
DPS commission
approved you

04:54.119 --> 04:55.773
for the in-house
therapist position.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.601
That's great.Yeah, well, it is,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.124
but there's a catch.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.952
They're insisting that
the job be full-time.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.346
[sighs]
I pushed back.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.608
I told them you're trying

05:04.652 --> 05:06.175
to make this work
with Sacred Heart.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.046
You've already had breakthroughs
over here, all that.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.048
They... were
not swayed.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.790
[sighs] You know
the kids need me.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.749
High school's only gotten
a lot tougher with all this

05:14.792 --> 05:16.011
Insta-crap.
I get it.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
I know what those kids
mean to you, but

05:17.839 --> 05:20.276
DPS does have a point
about consistency.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.758
The deeper you get with these
Rangers, harder it's gonna be

05:23.801 --> 05:25.325
to keep it a part-time thing.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.806
All right, look, I'm gonna
have to think about it.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.679
Whatever you decide, we're cool.

05:31.722 --> 05:32.897
All right?
All right.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.725
Appreciate it, Cap.Yeah, man.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.211
Let's see,
first on the list

05:42.254 --> 05:43.299
is The Balboa.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.781
The Balboa?
Sounds like a casino.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.305
[laughs] It's an apartment,
I swear.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.828
Okay, okay.

05:50.872 --> 05:54.397
Thank you for doing this.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.747
Pleasure's mine, Twyla Jean.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.359
[cell phone rings]Sorry. Uh...

05:59.663 --> 06:00.838
Go for Walker.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.274
Walker, I need you over at HQ.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.799
Denise, I requested
the morning off.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.323
James is aware.
I-Is this important?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.544
[chuckles] I sense
a wrench in our plans.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.762
Is that Twyla?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.024
Yes, it is.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.852
Bring her, too. I need you both.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.986
Copy that.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.644
All right, we're all set.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.080
The op is a go.Great.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.473
[cell phone buzzing]Oh.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.605
Um...

06:28.649 --> 06:30.520
Excuse me. One sec.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.174
Hello?

06:32.217 --> 06:33.523
Denise, hey.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.960
Hey. You know what, I'm, um,

06:36.004 --> 06:38.136
I'm a little tied up right now.
What can I do for you?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.747
Oh, um...

06:39.790 --> 06:42.097
Well, I was, uh,
I was just wondering,

06:42.140 --> 06:45.143
you know, we-we talked about
having dinner a while back, and

06:45.187 --> 06:47.624
we made reservations
at Revolori's tonight,

06:47.668 --> 06:49.278
and I...

06:49.321 --> 06:50.758
just wanted to make sure

06:50.801 --> 06:51.802
we were still on.

06:51.846 --> 06:52.803
DENISE:
You know what,

06:52.847 --> 06:54.196
I'm so sorry, Ger.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.154
Can we just, um...GERI: Here's the truth.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.765
I don't really know
how to do this.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.332
And I'm guessing
you probably don't either.

07:00.376 --> 07:03.988
So, family road trips when you
just find out you're family

07:04.032 --> 07:06.034
probably aren't the greatest.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.775
So, I think we should
do something else,

07:07.818 --> 07:09.211
maybe over pasta?

07:09.254 --> 07:10.473
You know what, um,

07:10.517 --> 07:11.648
I'm gonna have to call you back.

07:11.692 --> 07:15.086
Yeah, okay, um, I-I hope you do.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.350
How convenient
y'all were together.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.962
Yeah, Denise, um...

07:21.005 --> 07:23.443
just helping her
look for a new place.

07:23.486 --> 07:26.097
That's more a job for her
parole officer than a Ranger.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.578
She has skills that we
need for this assignment.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.580
That why you want her
as your new CI?

07:30.624 --> 07:33.191
Her expertise, both
in banking and in the rodeo,

07:33.235 --> 07:35.019
make her vital
to this particular case.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.239
That it? Or is this

07:37.282 --> 07:39.284
maybe just another way
to take a run at me?

07:39.328 --> 07:40.634
What are you talking about?

07:40.677 --> 07:42.244
You went after my father,
and you were wrong.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.900
Hey. Can we focus, please?

07:45.943 --> 07:48.119
Yes, sir, Cap.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.643
DENISE: As a condition
of your release,

07:49.686 --> 07:52.036
you are required to help
the DA's office

07:52.080 --> 07:53.342
with any investigational needs.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.475
Fully aware, ma'am.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.607
So, what bank teller's
skimming off the top?

07:57.651 --> 07:58.869
It's not a bank.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.567
It's an auction.
Travis County Horse Auction.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.307
JAMES: A regional
investigation discovered

08:02.351 --> 08:03.526
that someone's using the auction

08:03.570 --> 08:04.788
to launder money
for the Becerra Cartel.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.312
Becerra's the new guy
in town.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.619
He's trying to take over
Serano's old territory.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.579
This horse auction seems to be
his money laundering hub.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.929
So, if we can pinpoint
who's facilitating

08:14.972 --> 08:16.496
the washing
and stop them,

08:16.539 --> 08:18.410
Hydra won't grow a new head.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.890
That's where you come in.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.892
You want me to follow the money?

08:21.936 --> 08:23.285
Find the inside man?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.591
JAMES: Exactly,
but we don't know who

08:24.634 --> 08:26.027
on the inside's
cleaning the cash.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.463
We go in blazing,
they'll scatter

08:27.507 --> 08:29.987
like leaves, so it's gonna be
a three-person team.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.990
You, Cassie, and Twyla,
all right?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.818
Do you want to do this?

08:34.862 --> 08:36.603
Excuse me?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.082
Walker?

08:39.562 --> 08:40.520
It's okay.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.654
Okay, yeah, great.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.482
Let's do it, but if
there's even a whisper

08:46.526 --> 08:48.876
of danger,
I'm gonna call it,

08:48.919 --> 08:50.660
and we send in a tact team.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.402
Okay.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.841
You'll need these
to access the front office.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.583
Now, we've already cleared
the auction manager.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.542
He's clean, and he'll
help you gain access.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.674
AUCTIONEER [chanting]:
...five and a half. Five hundred

09:04.718 --> 09:08.939
thousand dollars and 25,
could be 25, anyone else?

09:08.983 --> 09:11.681
Sold! $500,000. Thank you.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.207
JAMES:
Walker's gonna cover you
from the stands.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.296
Cassie will surveil
the high-end bidders.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.733
Hey!

09:20.647 --> 09:22.518
[auctioneer chanting
indistinctly]

09:22.562 --> 09:24.564
DENISE:
Right. So, once you gain access

09:24.607 --> 09:26.696
to the registry, just look
for any discrepancies.

09:26.740 --> 09:27.871
Any new buyers,

09:27.915 --> 09:29.481
fuzzy math,

09:29.525 --> 09:33.050
anything out of the ordinary.[sighs] Okay.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.575
Anything unusual?

09:35.618 --> 09:39.143
Not yet,
just the usual suspects.

09:39.187 --> 09:43.147
Oh, Cassie, watch out
for Bob Brimley.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.236
What's he look like?Big fella,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.022
older than dirt,
wears one pair of overalls.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.764
Careful, he's handsy.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.070
[exhales]

09:53.114 --> 09:54.332
AUCTIONEER:
All right, these are some

09:54.376 --> 09:55.725
of the best horses
in the country.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.684
But be careful,
they're a little spirited.

09:57.727 --> 09:58.902
[neighs]

09:58.946 --> 10:01.644
AUCTIONEER:
Oh. Whoa! And there you go.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.952
TWYLA [over comms]:
Cordi.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.780
[Twyla speaks indistinctly]

10:06.823 --> 10:08.608
Cordi, did you hear me?

10:08.651 --> 10:10.000
Sorry, um...

10:10.044 --> 10:11.175
Didn't catch that.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.003
Jim Norwood.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.266
Never heard his name

10:15.310 --> 10:17.268
at any rodeo circuits.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.313
Let's see.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.228
He buys horses in volume,

10:20.271 --> 10:22.665
but never enters any contests.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.362
Uh, what do you mean?TWYLA: I mean,

10:24.406 --> 10:26.277
he buys horses
and sells them,

10:26.321 --> 10:27.888
and he keeps
within the margins

10:27.931 --> 10:30.020
as not to arouse
any lookie-loos.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.631
Well, that's
not at all sus.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.893
Huh.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.156
Every sale and purchase
Norwood has ever made

10:35.199 --> 10:37.375
has been executed
by the same auction clerk,

10:37.419 --> 10:39.639
a Miss Norma Ships.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.774
Hang on, folks.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.776
Someone else
is accessing the log.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.779
Wait, something's up.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
[auctioneer chanting
indistinctly]

10:51.738 --> 10:53.783
Guys, I think
we have movement.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.177
I'm calling it,
everyone clear out.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.885
Whoa.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.974
Haven't seen you around
here before, ma'am.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.497
Uh...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.804
New hire, sir,
and on the clock,

11:14.848 --> 11:16.153
so if you don't mind,

11:16.197 --> 11:17.589
I'm just gonna...

11:18.590 --> 11:21.071
Think we ought to
have a quick talk.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.334
Get you oriented.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.424
[auctioneer continues chanting]

11:37.131 --> 11:38.132
WALKER:
Uh, excuse me.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.351
[stammers]Hold on.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.005
Cordell Walker,

11:42.049 --> 11:43.398
Texas Ranger.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.574
Gentlemen,
I'm gonna have to ask you

11:45.617 --> 11:47.097
to put your weapons
on the ground.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.797
Great, great.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.102
All right.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.104
Hey, we're just taking care

11:54.148 --> 11:55.453
of some auction business.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.455
Okay. Then, uh,
no harm, no foul.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.848
I need you to take a step back.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.850
Thank you, sir.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.634
And why don't we, uh...

12:03.723 --> 12:05.333
Why don't we talk
some auction business?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.031
â™ª High on my birthday

12:08.075 --> 12:09.337
â™ª Who

12:09.380 --> 12:11.165
â™ª Said...

12:11.208 --> 12:13.689
[grunts]â™ª You're

12:13.733 --> 12:14.995
â™ª Free... No! Wait, wait.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.345
No, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold it!

12:17.388 --> 12:18.868
Stop. Hold it
right there.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.217
Don't-don't...

12:22.437 --> 12:24.004
I didn't do anything.Okay.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.222
I'm listening to you.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.050
What do you care?
They're just horses.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.399
WALKER:
All right.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.097
I'm gonna need you
to put the gun down.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.752
You're surrounded.

12:32.795 --> 12:33.883
â™ª I need a break

12:33.927 --> 12:36.451
â™ª Flying with a cigarette...

12:36.494 --> 12:38.148
[grunting]

12:38.192 --> 12:41.282
â™ª Who said you're

12:42.109 --> 12:44.285
â™ª Free

12:50.421 --> 12:53.337
â™ª We're just trying
to live a good life â™ª

12:53.381 --> 12:55.252
â™ª Look at us

12:55.296 --> 12:57.080
â™ª Who

12:57.124 --> 12:58.865
â™ª Said

12:58.908 --> 13:00.301
â™ª You're

13:00.344 --> 13:02.259
â™ª Free.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.479
â™ª

13:12.574 --> 13:13.923
[school bell rings]
Hey.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.272
Ooh, Stel, we're gonna be late.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.970
Were you for real?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.406
Yeah, we're gonnabe late,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.147
and Mr. Dunlap's
probably gonna freak.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.149
No, I mean about

13:22.192 --> 13:24.629
how you feel
about me.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.894
Yeah.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.113
Yeah, that's how I feel.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.985
I mean, since day one
in the parking lot,

13:32.028 --> 13:34.030
it's been you.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
I mean, I-I should've
just told you that

13:35.902 --> 13:37.860
instead of being mean
to the girl I like, and...

13:37.904 --> 13:40.863
Yeah, that probably
would've been a better option.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.430
[chuckles]

13:45.302 --> 13:47.000
If this is gonna work,

13:47.043 --> 13:51.004
we really need to be honest
with everybody.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.487
Yeah.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.794
Okay, yeah, cool.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.144
Wow.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.103
[school bell rings]

14:03.146 --> 14:05.583
Yeah.
[laughs]

14:10.197 --> 14:12.547
â™ª Got my temperature rising...

14:12.590 --> 14:14.766
That was crazy.
[chuckles]

14:14.810 --> 14:16.377
Duke and Twyla
together again.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.031
Okay, uh,
Cordell and

14:18.074 --> 14:20.598
Twyla. [clears throat]Well, still, it's got me

14:20.642 --> 14:23.514
feeling all... nostalgic.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.734
â™ª From my head to my feet...

14:26.735 --> 14:29.390
I got to ask,
did you ever even think about

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
taking me and that 300k
to Sayulita?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.176
No expectations,

14:33.220 --> 14:35.787
just go?

14:35.831 --> 14:38.225
[exhales]

14:38.268 --> 14:40.618
Is that a yes?That-that's a...

14:41.968 --> 14:43.883
A-A fantasy.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.581
Yours or mine?

14:48.452 --> 14:49.932
There's still time,
you know.

14:49.976 --> 14:53.762
Well, minus the money.
You kind of messed that up.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.025
[both laugh]I messed it up.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.681
But the other part...

14:59.724 --> 15:02.336
â™ª Is alive and well

15:04.207 --> 15:06.427
â™ª I'm all fired up

15:06.470 --> 15:08.255
â™ª All fired up...

15:08.298 --> 15:09.691
This feels familiar.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.302
[cell phone ringing]I should probably

15:12.346 --> 15:14.174
get this real fast.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.784
Uh-uh.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.788
â™ª The thrill
is alive and well â™ª

15:21.485 --> 15:23.313
â™ª All fired up

15:23.357 --> 15:25.315
â™ª You're all fired up

15:25.359 --> 15:27.013
â™ª The thrill is

15:27.056 --> 15:28.492
â™ª Alive and well.

ANNOUNCER [over P.A.]:
Welcome to senior week.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.627
We've got cornhole,
basketball, a photo booth,

15:32.670 --> 15:34.542
and don't forget to get
your yearbook signed.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.937
This week is all about you,
so have fun.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.292
[chuckles]

15:50.166 --> 15:52.038
[grunts]

15:52.081 --> 15:54.605
[indistinct chatter continues]

15:55.519 --> 15:57.391
Sorry, bro, bad shot.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.567
Just watch it, man.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.269
[grunts][students exclaiming]

16:09.185 --> 16:10.665
[overlapping shouting]

16:14.234 --> 16:16.671
Hey! Stop it!

16:24.809 --> 16:26.550
Get-- get off of me!

16:28.552 --> 16:30.467
STUDENTS:
Ooh!

16:32.252 --> 16:34.123
Coach, I'm sorry.
I didn't, I didn't...

16:34.167 --> 16:35.864
Both of you, outside, now.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.998
Go.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.567
The rest of you, go
back to whatever it is

16:43.611 --> 16:46.396
you were doing. Go.All right, Coach.

16:49.965 --> 16:53.229
So, let me get this straight...[chuckles]

16:53.273 --> 16:55.536
You race this
Dan Davidson...

16:55.579 --> 16:57.364
Um, Miller. Yeah.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.540
...for your family ranch,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.890
and due to some technicality,

17:01.933 --> 17:03.370
you lose to...

17:03.413 --> 17:04.545
Dan.
Miller.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.112
Yeah.
Because your

17:06.155 --> 17:08.244
saddle breaks.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.812
Yeah. I know,
I know, I know,

17:10.855 --> 17:12.466
it sounds absurd.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.381
No, it is absurd.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.296
100% absurd.

17:16.339 --> 17:20.387
He's not beating you in race,
not square, anyhow.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.434
I try not to
think about it.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.091
What do you think
about, then?

17:29.135 --> 17:32.573
I think about, um...

17:34.140 --> 17:36.272
...days like this, you,

17:36.316 --> 17:38.100
us.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.060
I think about us, too.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.104
Here,

17:42.148 --> 17:44.019
now,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.239
the moment.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.937
Is that good enough for you?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.939
More than good.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.767
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.769
Yeah?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.727
Yeah.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.911
Why the hell
were you fighting?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.959
I could hear your side of it,
or the principal can give you

18:11.002 --> 18:13.309
the standard suspension.
It's your choice.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.008
All right.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.185
Wait, Coach.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.838
It was my fault.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.364
I started it.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.284
Ah. Okay, I get it.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.894
Stella Walker.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.463
Guys, I need you to shake hands

18:36.506 --> 18:38.378
and squash this.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.771
Right now. Let's go.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.257
I'm sorry, bro.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.173
I was out of line.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
No, it's cool, man.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.874
Good. Colton, you can go.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.878
Todd, you stay.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.492
[door opens]

19:05.535 --> 19:07.624
[door closes]Come on, man.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.539
If you hit any other
teacher, do you know

19:09.583 --> 19:10.975
how much trouble
you'd be in right now?

19:11.019 --> 19:12.890
I know, Coach,
and I'm-I'm sorry.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.589
I... [scoffs]
I can take a punch,

19:15.632 --> 19:18.505
and I'd definitely choose
a sore jaw over a broken heart

19:18.548 --> 19:20.594
any day of the week.Coach...

19:21.943 --> 19:23.945
I think...

19:23.988 --> 19:25.251
I think she likes Colton.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.601
You do know
it's her choice, right?

19:27.644 --> 19:28.471
Yeah, but

19:28.515 --> 19:30.778
shouldn't I try or whatever?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.998
W... [sighs]

19:35.609 --> 19:38.133
Listen, I recently
went through a breakup,

19:38.177 --> 19:40.570
one that I didn't
see coming.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.356
Both people have to want
a relationship.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.662
And the one who wants it
the least, well,

19:45.706 --> 19:47.273
they're the ones

19:47.316 --> 19:50.189
who have the power.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.018
It does get easier
after high school.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.412
Seriously?Nah, not at all.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.979
[laughs]

19:58.022 --> 20:01.287
But you do get a better
understanding of things.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.334
Thanks, Mr. Barnett,

20:05.378 --> 20:06.683
for everything.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.251
Of course.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.170
[knock on door]

20:17.825 --> 20:18.913
Hey.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.655
Hi. You're back.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.265
[clears throat]

20:23.309 --> 20:25.180
With flowers.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.443
Yeah.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.576
[exhales]: Well...

20:29.619 --> 20:31.447
What's the occasion?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.972
Happy Day Zero.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.977
I'm sorry, day zero?Yeah, because

20:40.021 --> 20:42.632
I hope that tomorrow can be

20:42.676 --> 20:46.114
Day One of us.

20:47.681 --> 20:48.769
[sighs] Cordi, I don't know.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
No, I-I don't know either,

20:50.814 --> 20:52.294
but if I'm
being honest,

20:52.338 --> 20:55.079
I want to know what

20:55.123 --> 20:56.820
being together actually

20:56.864 --> 20:59.432
feels like,
i-if-if-if you do.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.267
To Day Zero, then. [chuckles]

21:09.877 --> 21:11.270
To Day Zero.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.494
â™ª

21:20.366 --> 21:21.584
WALKER:
Geri, hey.

21:21.628 --> 21:24.152
Uh, have you seen
Augie around?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.110
He-he said he was coming
here after school.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.764
Yeah, he's in the back
washing dishes.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.592
All right.
Hey.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.767
Um...Yeah?

21:30.811 --> 21:32.769
I saw you...

21:32.813 --> 21:34.597
here the other night

21:34.641 --> 21:36.077
with Twyla.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.079
[sighs] Ger...

21:38.122 --> 21:40.429
No, Cordi, I'm not jealous.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.345
But why would you
go back to that?

21:43.389 --> 21:46.348
It was such a dark time
in your life, Cordi.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.219
Everything that
she represents,

21:48.263 --> 21:50.613
to you and...

21:50.657 --> 21:52.049
yeah, to me, too,

21:52.093 --> 21:53.442
okay?
Geri, I hear you,

21:53.486 --> 21:55.139
but it's not
like that,

21:55.183 --> 21:58.882
okay? A-And she's...
she's not like that.Mm-hmm.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.145
Does your family know?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.627
Right.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.455
Do your kids
a favor,

22:06.499 --> 22:08.718
don't let them
get caught off guard

22:08.762 --> 22:10.154
by seeing
you two together.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.983
All your history
undercover... You know?

22:14.028 --> 22:17.031
Okay? I mean,
you owe them that much.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.341
â™ª Be the same.

22:23.254 --> 22:26.214
I don't know.
That's a real nice ski mask.[both laugh]

22:26.257 --> 22:28.651
Oh, my gosh. That's funny.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.523
[Walker and August laugh]

22:32.089 --> 22:34.048
WALKER:
Mm, mm.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.310
All right, Augie,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.225
uh, she-she's here.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.097
[chair scrapes floor]

22:41.229 --> 22:42.491
Hey.Hi.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.667
Hi.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.886
I'm Twyla.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.235
I know who you are.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.281
Please. Yeah.Okay.

22:55.678 --> 22:56.940
What you don't know,

22:56.984 --> 22:59.508
is...

22:59.552 --> 23:01.728
how sorry I am.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.861
I feel awful

23:04.905 --> 23:08.256
for all the hurt I've caused
you and your family.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.432
Look, I wish I could
undo it all,

23:10.476 --> 23:12.695
and I know that
I can't, but...

23:12.739 --> 23:16.395
I can do everything possible
from here on out to make amends.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.138
[sighs]

23:21.182 --> 23:24.533
Look, you, um...

23:24.577 --> 23:27.710
you told my dad
where Clint West was,

23:27.754 --> 23:31.540
and that saved my sister,
so... thanks.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.282
It was nothing.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.373
Uh, so your dad told you

23:38.417 --> 23:40.680
we've been working together
over the last week or so?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.159
Yeah.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.248
WALKER: Yeah, yeah, a-a-and
now that the case is over,

23:44.292 --> 23:45.902
Twyla is thinking about

23:45.946 --> 23:48.122
sticking around for a while.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.951
Uh... [inhales]

23:55.608 --> 23:57.523
That's it? [chuckles]
I'm sorry,

23:57.566 --> 23:59.089
I thought you guys were
gonna say something

23:59.133 --> 24:00.090
completely different.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.179
Like you were dating.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.879
And, Twyla, I really like how
you're turning your life around,

24:05.922 --> 24:07.750
but our family

24:07.794 --> 24:09.970
is-is kind of... okay

24:10.013 --> 24:11.885
at the moment,
you know?

24:11.928 --> 24:13.974
Yeah.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.759
Uh, w-well, actually,

24:16.803 --> 24:17.891
Augie, I'm gonna

24:17.934 --> 24:19.719
tell you that Twyla and I,

24:19.762 --> 24:21.285
we, um...

24:21.329 --> 24:24.419
we-we talked about,
you know, dating,

24:24.463 --> 24:26.508
and-and-and we,
uh, we decided...

24:26.552 --> 24:27.683
TWYLA:
Uh, we

24:27.727 --> 24:30.599
ultimately decided against it.[sighs]

24:31.992 --> 24:33.776
Yeah, um...

24:33.820 --> 24:36.475
You know, I like your dad

24:36.518 --> 24:37.693
a lot.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.218
But I think we can
all agree that...

24:43.525 --> 24:46.093
...there's just
too much history.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.053
Okay, great. I'll be in the car.

24:50.097 --> 24:53.100
Yeah, yeah,
of course, bud.[sighs]

24:56.495 --> 24:57.496
Twyla...

24:59.759 --> 25:01.456
If this is too soon...

25:01.500 --> 25:03.937
[stammers]I know, it's-it's fine.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.200
Okay? Um...

25:09.203 --> 25:10.596
I guess we can
call it...

25:11.901 --> 25:14.208
...a failure to launch.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.009
â™ª

25:38.841 --> 25:40.582
Hey.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.323
Hey. Um...

25:42.366 --> 25:44.455
If this is a bad time, I can...

25:44.499 --> 25:47.154
Uh, no, no, please.
Sorry. Come on in.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.416
Sorry, I should've

25:48.459 --> 25:50.070
called you back earlier.No. No.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.767
I kind of ambushed you.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.726
Well, we're family now,

25:53.769 --> 25:57.077
so I guess that's
part of the territory.Yeah.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.080
Um...You know, one of
the most tragic things

26:00.123 --> 26:01.429
about this whole thing

26:01.472 --> 26:03.387
is that
we were both robbed of a sister.

26:05.389 --> 26:08.175
But I think we could
still change that.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.440
Um...

26:12.483 --> 26:15.095
um, Geri... I would like that.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.618
I... I really would.

26:16.662 --> 26:20.274
But if I am completely
honest with you...

26:21.231 --> 26:23.407
...when I look at you,

26:23.451 --> 26:26.933
all I see is the daughter
of Frank Broussard,

26:26.976 --> 26:29.588
the man responsible
for my father's death.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.460
I know that's
not on you...

26:32.503 --> 26:33.592
No, that's not on me.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.463
Nor is the
fact that

26:35.506 --> 26:38.422
Marv Davidson
gave me away on you.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.948
We were both victimized
by these men,

26:41.991 --> 26:44.603
our dads.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.909
And now that we know the truth,

26:46.953 --> 26:49.477
don't you think
that-that we both owe it

26:49.520 --> 26:51.740
to each other to make
some kind of peace?

26:54.482 --> 26:56.571
How about we get a drink?

26:58.181 --> 27:00.967
I happen to know a place.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.664
[overlapping chatter]

27:02.708 --> 27:04.361
TEACHER:
Would you please take
your seats, seniors?

27:04.405 --> 27:06.668
The slideshow is about to begin.

27:09.453 --> 27:12.805
Hey, you didn't text me
back last night.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.243
[students whooping, applauding]

27:17.418 --> 27:21.509

Uh, I'm sorry, I have to...

28:13.953 --> 28:16.564
â™ª Looks like we made it

Chris!

28:45.636 --> 28:46.507
Hi.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.900
Can I help you, Ranger?

28:47.943 --> 28:50.076
Yes. Uh, do you happen
to have your keys on you?

28:50.119 --> 28:52.687
Sure.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.428
Thanks.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.581
Do you know where she is?I have no idea.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.025
DISPATCHER:
Hey.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.505
This is Walker. Um...

29:30.681 --> 29:34.163
I think we have a fugitive.
Twyla Jean.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.396
Hey.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.444
What's going on, Stel?

29:54.488 --> 29:57.665
Remember when I said
we needed to talk?

29:57.708 --> 30:01.712
Yeah. I think I know
what about, too.

30:05.412 --> 30:10.678
Um, I don't think we can
be together anymore.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.072
You're a really
great guy, Todd,

30:13.115 --> 30:14.813
and I really like you, but...

30:14.856 --> 30:17.163
You don't have to say
all that stuff.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.078
Please don't, actually.

30:21.907 --> 30:25.040
This is about Colton, right?

30:26.912 --> 30:30.959
I'd be lying if I said he has
nothing to do with it.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.656
But with or without Colton...

30:32.700 --> 30:35.877
You don't want me.

30:37.705 --> 30:40.229
I just want you
to be happy, Stel.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.798
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.757
Thank you for saying that.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.063
I'm not saying
let's be friends

30:48.107 --> 30:51.719
right away
or anything, but...

30:51.762 --> 30:53.634
Sauber starts
in the fall.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.244
See you on campus?

30:55.288 --> 30:56.332
Okay.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.595
Come here.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.135
Hey.Hey.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.919
What's going on?
Dispatch said you were

31:17.963 --> 31:19.268
driving her to the county line.Yeah.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.618
As per the DA's office.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.142
DA's office?Yeah.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.580
Hays County is here to pick
her up. Thought you knew.

31:26.623 --> 31:27.929
I guess I didn't get
the message.

31:27.973 --> 31:32.151
Uh, Cass, can you
give us a minute?

31:32.978 --> 31:35.371
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.895
[mouths words]

31:41.247 --> 31:42.944
I can't believe
Denise transferred you.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.685
I'm gonna call her
right now and fix this.Uh...

31:44.728 --> 31:46.382
I asked to be transferred,

31:46.426 --> 31:48.645
and the DA kindly obliged.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.909
Y... You asked...

31:52.998 --> 31:55.652
Twyla, if this is about
what August said...

31:55.696 --> 31:58.046
The kid spoke his mind.

31:58.090 --> 32:02.659
But the truth is,
us being together...

32:02.703 --> 32:05.836
it isn't really
in the cards, is it?

32:09.318 --> 32:10.667
My brother was right.

32:10.711 --> 32:14.497
He, uh-- He said I don't know
how to do casual.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.977
[soft laugh]

32:16.021 --> 32:18.806
That seems like
a fair assessment.Yeah.

32:19.546 --> 32:20.982
Twyla, you've changed.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.331
You really have,
for the better.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.377
And that's so great.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.335
But I guess I haven't.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.946
I just lost sight

32:27.989 --> 32:30.252
of who I really was for a bit.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.736
Duke...

32:35.779 --> 32:38.086
...was your person.

32:39.392 --> 32:42.917
Cordell... he's someone else's.

32:45.137 --> 32:49.054
Well, we sure do know how to
have a damn good time, though.

32:49.097 --> 32:54.015
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, we do. Um...

32:54.059 --> 32:56.800
Were you really gonna-- gonna
leave without saying goodbye?

32:56.844 --> 32:58.324
Ugh. You know me.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.805
I-I didn't want to
make a big to-do.

33:02.763 --> 33:03.851
Yeah.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.418
They're waiting on me.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.680
Of course. Yeah.I gotta go.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.116
Yeah, uh...

33:12.425 --> 33:14.905
â™ª And be the song

33:14.949 --> 33:16.690
You take care of yourself,
Twyla Jean.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.561
â™ª Just be the song

33:18.605 --> 33:21.695
I'll see you around, Cordell.

33:23.131 --> 33:27.483
â™ª Flow down all my mountains

33:27.527 --> 33:31.748
â™ª Darling, fill my valleys

33:31.792 --> 33:36.057
â™ª Flow down all my mountains

33:36.101 --> 33:41.062
â™ª Darling, fill my valleys

33:41.106 --> 33:45.545
â™ª Flow down all my mountains

33:45.588 --> 33:49.766
â™ª Darling, fill my valleys

33:49.810 --> 33:54.554
â™ª Flow down all my mountains

33:54.597 --> 33:57.818
â™ª Darling.

34:05.260 --> 34:08.307
These two legends
were so loud

34:08.350 --> 34:11.179
that Dan changed
the name of our Wi-Fi

34:11.223 --> 34:13.094
to "We Can Hear You."[laughs]

34:13.138 --> 34:15.923
And the old lady Agnes
changes hers that night

34:15.966 --> 34:17.751
to "Yeah? What's Your Point?"

34:17.794 --> 34:19.448
No! Oh, my gosh.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.625
They're at least 80 years old.
[laughing]Wow.

34:22.669 --> 34:25.063
Well, I will drink to that.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.239
Yeah. Amen, sister.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.807
That was, you know...

34:30.851 --> 34:32.635
No, no.
It's-it's actually

34:32.679 --> 34:34.898
very nice to hear.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.552
Cheers.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.033
Cheers.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.691
I do have to say
there have been

34:44.734 --> 34:46.954
a lot of times in my life

34:46.997 --> 34:49.609
that I would have loved
a shoulder to cry on.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.219
Wait, don't get me wrong.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.134
Mom has her good qualities.Mm.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.657
[laughs]
Mm-hmm.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.051
But something tells me that

34:57.095 --> 35:00.098
you're probably
a better listener.Well, thank you.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.318
And I want you to remember

35:03.362 --> 35:06.147
that now you do have a shoulder.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.801
I mean a third.[laughs]

35:07.844 --> 35:09.672
Oh, hell, that came out wrong.

35:09.716 --> 35:12.110
No. It's nice to hear.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.509
I'm gonna do it.
It's gonna happen.

35:20.553 --> 35:23.251
It's time. It's time!

35:24.209 --> 35:26.559
What are you doing?

35:26.602 --> 35:30.084
Today's the day that
good ol' Denise the Deer

35:30.128 --> 35:32.260
comes down.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.045
Okay, well, first of all,
that's a boar,

35:35.089 --> 35:36.525
not a deer;
I'm not that drunk.

35:36.569 --> 35:40.094
Well, whatever it is,
it's coming down.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.443
What-- Wait, wait.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.010
Wasn't that a present
from Emily Walker?

35:43.053 --> 35:44.881
Yes, it was.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.362
And she would want you
to feel welcome.

35:47.406 --> 35:48.624
So do I.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.974
Thank you.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.716
Hey, Louis?Mm-hmm?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.762
Can you put this
in storage for me?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.894
Thank you.Got it, Geri. Yeah.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.204
Last call?

36:03.248 --> 36:04.466
Um...

36:08.035 --> 36:10.342
Oop![laughs]

36:13.780 --> 36:17.262
To family.To blood.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.704
[knock on door]

36:24.747 --> 36:26.184
Hey, hey, hey.Hey.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.098
Come on in.
What's up?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.927
I just wanted to come
let you know that I...

36:30.971 --> 36:32.494
I've come to a decision.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.496
Okay. And?

36:36.019 --> 36:38.239
I still got work to do
at the school.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.893
I see.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.983
But I have a proposition
for you.

36:44.593 --> 36:45.986
All right.
I'm all ears.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.509
I owe it to these seniors

36:47.553 --> 36:49.816
to see them through to
the end of the school year.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.252
They've worked hard,

36:51.296 --> 36:53.341
and I want to see them
get their diplomas.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.562
But after that,
when the summer hits,

36:56.605 --> 36:58.651
I'll join up here.

36:58.694 --> 37:01.393
Full-fledged.
Really?

37:02.959 --> 37:05.005
I'll talk to the DPS
commission.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.659
Yeah?
School's almost out.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.269
Seems reasonable to me, right?

37:08.313 --> 37:11.403
Yeah.
Thank you, Cap.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.666
I appreciate it.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.015
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.756
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.106
My man.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.646
Hey, Bill, it's Captain James.

37:37.690 --> 37:41.346
Listen, we're probably gonna
have to pull some strings,

37:41.389 --> 37:43.130
but I just found
the perfect candidate

37:43.173 --> 37:45.872
for the open Ranger position
that we need to fill.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.354
Yeah. All right, we'll talk.

37:56.230 --> 37:59.320
Hey, that's my parking spot.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.931
What, this a reenactment
of when we first met?

38:01.975 --> 38:03.368
[chuckles]
Oh, do you--

38:03.411 --> 38:05.108
Do you not want
August to sucker punch you?

38:05.152 --> 38:07.546
No, I definitely
don't need that.

38:08.895 --> 38:11.114
So, um, what's up?

38:11.158 --> 38:13.856
It's over between me and Todd.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.206
Are you okay?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.208
Yeah.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.385
Yeah?

38:20.428 --> 38:21.951
Yeah.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.389
Okay.
So...

38:24.432 --> 38:27.000
it seems like our families
have stopped fighting.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.350
My gramps is working
with your dad.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.526
Our grandmas aren't throwing
chili at each other.

38:31.570 --> 38:35.922
And we can both sort of
call Geri our aunt now.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.967
That's weird.
Mm-hmm.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.621
Yeah. So, um,

38:39.665 --> 38:44.713
how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

38:44.757 --> 38:46.933
Probably not forever, sadly.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.067
But that doesn't really
matter to us.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.939
Right?[chuckles]

38:54.941 --> 38:57.987
Uh, I really like you, Stella.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.468
I really like you, too.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.905
â™ª Smoking, hanging off
of my hand â™ª

39:02.949 --> 39:06.082
â™ª And coughing, "Do you wanna
move in with me?" â™ª

39:06.866 --> 39:09.129
â™ª Oh, love, oh, my, my

39:09.172 --> 39:11.305
â™ª Don't you find it moving

39:11.349 --> 39:14.134
â™ª How we're still alone.

39:14.961 --> 39:16.876
[door opens]

39:16.919 --> 39:19.095
Hey.
Hey.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.576
Look at you, breaking
and entering again.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.926
[laughs]

39:23.970 --> 39:27.408
Hey, how did, uh...
how did yesterday go?

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
It was great, actually.Good.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.544
Ben thinks picnics should
stay in the 1950s...

39:32.587 --> 39:34.284
Oh......but we stayed in,
ordered ramen.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.373
Okay.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.984
Well, you-you love ramen.
Lucky you.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.769
I love ramen.
[laughing]:
You love ramen.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.684
Yeah. So how'd it go
with Twyla?

39:42.728 --> 39:46.645
Uh, she asked to be transferred
to the next county over.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.430
Oh, man, I'm-I'm sorry.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.736
No, don't be.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.346
You were right about me.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.436
About who I am.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.180
When I was with Twyla,

40:00.223 --> 40:02.922
I was able to forget
about everything

40:02.965 --> 40:07.666
because I was literally
pretending to be someone else.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.538
Duke.
But that's another life.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.889
You know, one without
responsibilities, uh,

40:13.933 --> 40:17.066
or attachments.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.374
Definitely not mine.

40:20.418 --> 40:24.857
Someone would have to pry
this family away from me

40:24.900 --> 40:30.166
for me to ever walk away
from it again.

40:30.210 --> 40:35.084
And, uh, if-- or when--

40:35.128 --> 40:37.391
the feeling does come up

40:37.435 --> 40:40.133
where you need
to follow your heart,

40:40.176 --> 40:42.527
I volunteer to take you
to the airport.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.355
[laughs]
To make sure that
you board that plane.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.880
Okay.
I will buy you
that ticket.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.011
Yeah, fair enough.Okay?

40:49.055 --> 40:50.752
I know you will.
I know you will.

40:50.796 --> 40:51.927
Twyla said something else.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.190
She mentioned something,
and it...

40:54.234 --> 40:57.150
I can't stop thinking
about it.

40:57.193 --> 41:00.240
What? What'd she say?

41:02.024 --> 41:03.852
She asked about the-the race.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.854
The race for the ranch.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.247
She couldn't believe
I lost.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.945
And the truth is,
I can't believe

41:09.989 --> 41:12.382
I lost, either.

41:12.426 --> 41:15.037
I mean, Dan's a good--
a good rider, he is.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.126
But something happened
at this horse auction

41:17.170 --> 41:18.388
I had to go to for work.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.434
I-I watched a rider
take a tumble

41:20.478 --> 41:23.916
because his saddle
wasn't secured properly.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.309
[exhales]
Let me ask you this.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.660
So-so Daddy's been working
with leather

41:28.703 --> 41:30.836
basically his whole life,
right?

41:30.879 --> 41:32.881
Right.

41:32.925 --> 41:37.451
How many of his straps
have snapped?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.757
None.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.062
Exactly. None.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.064
So what are the odds
that, on the day

41:42.108 --> 41:44.458
I'm supposed to race
for our family's legacy,

41:44.502 --> 41:47.026
the leather gives out?

41:49.028 --> 41:51.900
Cordell, what are you saying?

41:51.944 --> 41:55.556
I'm saying, the Davidsons...

41:55.600 --> 41:56.949
what if they cheated?
