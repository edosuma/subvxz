is stuck in the game now?

What? Come on!
We're all thinking it!

If your clock--

35:41.606 --> 35:42.839
What? Come on!
We're all thinking it!

35:42.841 --> 35:44.257
If you have to escape
before your clock zeroes out

35:44.258 --> 35:45.674
What? Come on!
We're all thinking it!

35:45.677 --> 35:46.726
and our time is
already this low, I mean,

35:47.779 --> 35:50.530
it's safe to assume Jake's
zeroed out a long time ago.

What? Come on!
We're all thinking it!

35:53.285 --> 35:53.784
- Look, she has a point.

35:53.785 --> 35:54.284
What? Come on!

What if we find him and he
tries to kill us? I mean,

35:55.253 --> 35:56.219

Those soldiers did say that he's
the right hand of The King,

35:57.255 --> 35:58.288

We're all thinking it!

35:58.290 --> 35:59.556
so what if we're just walking
ourselves into a trap or--

35:59.557 --> 36:00.823

36:00.826 --> 36:02.242
