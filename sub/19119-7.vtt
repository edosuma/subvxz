00:00.768 --> 00:03.171
-Previously on Outsiders...

00:03.171 --> 00:05.239
-HOUGHTON: You railroaded
that kid on that murder charge.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.540
I told you he was innocent
and he was.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.143
Foster Farrell killed
an inmate. Broke his neck.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.445
(cheering)

00:11.445 --> 00:14.248
Hasil Farrell,
you're a rich man.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.783
So you gonna tell me
how you got this black eye?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.451
I fight.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.752
I fight people.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.389
This is your fault.
You need to quit

00:21.389 --> 00:23.057
-that group of yours. -Yeah.
I'm not gonna do that, Wade.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.658
That is never gonna happen.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.394
I'm gonna go in there and pack
a bag for Caleb and the girls,

00:26.394 --> 00:28.096
'cause we can't stay here.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.264
My name is Gordon.
I'm not from here,

00:30.264 --> 00:32.500
but I heard about you from
all the way across the country.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.068
You guys are amazing.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.603
All of this is my fault.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.639
I didn't do something
when I should have.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.774
I know what I have to do,

00:40.774 --> 00:43.244
but it's not necessarily legal.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.812
So the strongest
of you must die.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.680
You're gonna kill a man
for his blood.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.183
MOREGON:
Not me. You.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.320
(gasping, screaming)

00:52.320 --> 00:53.754
G'WIN:
Moregon, wait.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.793
-(all gasp, women screaming)
-BIG FOSTER: Cut me loose!

00:59.793 --> 01:02.263
(yells)

01:02.263 --> 01:04.398
(quietly):
G'Winveer. My queen.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.833
My queen.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.142
(women chanting
in foreign language, echoing)

01:36.897 --> 01:38.866
*

01:48.209 --> 01:49.743
Any trouble?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.512
Not a lick.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.647
Snake with the head gone
can't bite.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.517
BIG FOSTER: A snake's head can
strike long after it's cut off.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.852
No. They ain't to be trusted.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.155
What do we do with them?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.756
That's for the Bren'in
to decide once she's mended.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.326
-EMELYE: Foster. Foster!
-Hmm.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.460
She's awake.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.596
(grunts)

02:10.564 --> 02:12.400
(country blues music)

02:14.335 --> 02:17.905
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

02:17.905 --> 02:22.543
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:22.543 --> 02:25.613
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

02:25.613 --> 02:28.249
* And they'll go running back

02:28.249 --> 02:31.685
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:33.421 --> 02:36.890
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

02:39.927 --> 02:42.363
* And the land

02:42.363 --> 02:45.833
* Will suffer those who came.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.446
What are you doing setting up?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.382
I...

03:01.382 --> 03:03.851
I wanted to make a poultice.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.953
Bloodwort and speckled alder.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.922
I started it, but the...
the room got to spinning.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.259
Well, let's get you back down.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.793
-I'm fine.
-No. You need to rest.

03:12.793 --> 03:16.464
Hey. You just let me
take care of you now.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.234
-(winces)
-Oh. I got you.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.569
-(moans)
-No. I got you.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.936
Okay. There you go.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.272
(grunts)

03:25.939 --> 03:28.342
(coughs)

03:28.342 --> 03:30.478
I really... I got
to make a poult...

03:30.478 --> 03:34.282
No. You... let me do it.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.549
Huh, G'Win?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.693
What if it was all a dream?

03:45.693 --> 03:46.827
What?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.397
The Kinnah.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.366
What if they were some
kind of...

03:52.366 --> 03:54.635
vision?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.870
Conjured by the mountain,
sent to warn us?

03:56.870 --> 03:59.607
No. No. We got cousins

03:59.607 --> 04:02.676
cold and dead
thanks to them witches.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.844
That weren't no vision.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.448
Are they still among us?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.950
We're watching them.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.553
Waiting, until you're ready

04:12.553 --> 04:15.689
to decide their punishment.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.658
Free them.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.060
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.563
Let them go.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.932
What? So they can run off?
Get their strength back up,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.934
come back after us again
with fresh terrors?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.970
It was her, Foster.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.406
It was Moregon.

04:32.406 --> 04:35.809
The others, without her,
they're...

04:35.809 --> 04:37.845
they're lost.

04:37.845 --> 04:41.048
Then we will do as you wish.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.385
Yeah. We will set them free.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.390
Probably walk off
a cliff, the whole lot of them,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.058
without that demon to lead them.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.527
But what if she was right?

04:53.527 --> 04:54.995
Oh.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.097
-Now, that's the fever talking.
-No.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.800
No. What if...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
it's us killing the mountain?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.104
Not those below,
I mean, we're...

05:04.104 --> 05:05.806
we're no better than them.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.875
We're fighting
amongst ourselves,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.478
we're... we're taking
on their ways.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.847
We're drowning our good in
all manner of vice and impurity.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.049
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.086
You calm yourself. Huh?

05:19.086 --> 05:22.723
Don't give that monster
a fresh thought.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.693
Hey.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.828
(G'Win winces)

05:34.368 --> 05:36.604
Why?

05:36.604 --> 05:38.672
Why did you do it?

05:40.808 --> 05:43.477
You should've killed me,

05:43.477 --> 05:45.145
like they wanted.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.048
I was ready.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.452
Oh, please, please.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.655
Don't die.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.089
Please don't die.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.659
(crying):
You can't.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.629
I can.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.965
And I likely will.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.936
MEYERS:
What is it with you

06:08.936 --> 06:10.671
and your weird fascination
with the Farrells?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.905
HOUGHTON: There's a man
in county right now.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.206
I helped put him in there.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.543
That's weighin' on me
pretty damned heavy right now.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.111
FOSTER: I believe you, Wade.
But if you're lying,

06:18.111 --> 06:20.514
you're gonna pay for it.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.616
HOUGHTON:
All of this is my fault.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.921
-Morning.
-Hey.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.757
I have to run everybody
back to the house

06:29.757 --> 06:31.425
for breakfast before school.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.826
The girls
are already in the car.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.127
Well... I mean,
we got breakfast here.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.563
There's cereal.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.164
Well, what are we gonna
pour over it?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.500
That milk you got
is halfway to yogurt.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.668
Go brush your teeth, sweetie.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.869
-I already did.
-Okay.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.771
Go wait in the car
with the girls.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.977
-Your bag.
-LEDDA: Hey.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.112
HOUGHTON:
You gonna give me a hug?

06:53.180 --> 06:55.148
Have a good day.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.120
-(door opens)
-Hey.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.789
(door closes)

07:01.789 --> 07:03.791
Were you drinking last night?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.660
No.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.730
Not a drop.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.233
Yeah?
'Cause you were talking crazy.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.502
Mm-hmm.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.903
I said a lot of stuff I...

07:15.903 --> 07:18.038
probably shouldn't have said.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.041
I'm sorry.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.512
Well.

07:24.512 --> 07:28.882
I was worried about you.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.785
Well. We got enough to worry
about without worrying about me.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.153
-Hey, listen.
-What? Look, I got to go.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.755
I don't want to go
uprooting the girls,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.024
so, let's move
back to your house.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.226
I'll assign one of my deputies,
post him out front

07:39.226 --> 07:41.061
for the next week or so.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.631
That okay by you?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.866
Yeah. Thank you, Wade.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.636
Okay.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.974
DOLAN:
Dolan.
(line ringing)

07:53.974 --> 07:56.209
Dolan. It's Wade, here.
How you doing?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.078
Oh, morning, Sheriff.
Hey. Uh, listen,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.247
I was thinking about coming out
to see you guys on Sunday.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.149
I want to talk
to that Farrell fella some more,

08:02.149 --> 08:03.917
ask him a few questions
about Breece.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.653
Oh, Sunday'll be too late.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.054
He's getting shipped off
to state pen

08:07.054 --> 08:08.989
in Central City
tomorrow afternoon.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.626
State? They're...
They're gonna take him to state?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.628
You heard what he did, right?
Yeah.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.731
Guy he killed
was a first-class piece of shit,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.533
but rules are rules.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.968
I feel sorry
for the poor bastard.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.603
Born free as a jaybird.
Now he's gonna spend

08:22.603 --> 08:26.006
the rest of his life
in a concrete box.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.944
*

08:32.946 --> 08:35.549
-(counter bell jingles)
-You here for the order?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.818
Cup of coffee, too, if it's not
too much trouble, Dorothy.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.753
Sure thing.
Bet your kids are excited

08:39.753 --> 08:41.088
about the parade tomorrow.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.056
Yeah. They are.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.861
-Thanks.
-Sure.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.534
Hello.

08:58.972 --> 09:02.075
-Mm. -Hope your Mountain Witness
people like cold cuts.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.276
-There's one more.
-(they chuckle)

09:03.276 --> 09:05.112
Thanks.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.215
MAN:
That's what I thought.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.685
You're that... Ledda Dobbs.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.254
You run...

09:14.254 --> 09:17.625
you run that Mountain Witness
organization.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.693
Raising ruckus.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.028
With coal people.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.896
Yeah. That's me.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.131
Well, ma'am,

09:24.131 --> 09:27.768
my name is... Ennis Melaney.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.804
And I worked in coal

09:30.804 --> 09:33.874
for 38 years.

09:33.874 --> 09:37.344
My whole working life.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.749
And them bastards,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.885
they took my lungs.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.655
And I won't get

09:47.655 --> 09:50.257
to meet all my grandkids.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.892
Won't...

09:51.892 --> 09:54.261
I won't get...

09:54.261 --> 09:55.896
to spend time

09:55.896 --> 09:59.733
with the ones I already met,

09:59.733 --> 10:01.201
ma'am.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.103
You...

10:03.103 --> 10:06.907
You keep doing
what you're doing.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
Fighting

10:08.909 --> 10:11.779
the good fight.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.250
Thank you.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.730
TOWNIE GUARD:
Help you?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.131
Yeah. You can get out of my way.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.266
Sorry, Sheriff.
I didn't recognize you.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.835
-What you doing way up here?
-We got a call

10:34.835 --> 10:36.436
about a rabid dog.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.172
Ain't seen or heard no dogs.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.741
Yeah, well.
I'm-a go take a look.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.043
Uh... I can't really let
you do that, Sheriff.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.146
-Excuse me? -Uh, anybody wants
to go up past this point here,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.948
I got to clear it
with Mr. Meyers' office.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.917
They're calling all this
private property.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.885
You know Mr. Meyers
has no authority

10:51.885 --> 10:54.221
over local law enforcement?
You know that, right?

10:54.221 --> 10:57.324
I-I ain't worked in nearly
two years before this, Sheriff.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.327
I got six kids.
I got to do what they tell me.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.399
Someone gets dog bit,
it's on you.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.735
Yes, sir.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.318
Goddamn it.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.062
Shame it has to end this way.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.830
Gonna miss you, boy.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.999
What, are you leaving?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.934
No, you.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.137
Green Valley State Penitentiary.
Heading out tomorrow.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.807
Green Valley? I'm guessing it's
neither one of those things.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.743
WALT:
You'd be right.

11:49.743 --> 11:53.280
You'd best enjoy the sunlight
while you can.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.115
-Roll on 23!
-(gate buzzes)

12:07.227 --> 12:09.997
(people yelling,
sirens wailing on video)

12:12.032 --> 12:14.201
(video stops)

12:14.201 --> 12:16.169
Creek River, Oregon.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.171
Local communities have been
fighting dam construction

12:18.171 --> 12:20.040
in Southern Oregon for years.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.442
This is how heated things got.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.177
But did it work?

12:24.177 --> 12:25.946
Did you stop them
from building the dam?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.547
No.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.049
(laptop closes)

12:29.049 --> 12:31.318
But over nine million people
saw that video.

12:31.318 --> 12:35.088
Look, I didn't show you that
to scare you, okay?

12:35.088 --> 12:38.491
A serious action doesn't come
without its risks.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.527
Look, I'm not saying
that something like this

12:40.527 --> 12:42.095
is gonna happen tomorrow,

12:42.095 --> 12:43.931
but you never know.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.133
(murmuring)

12:46.133 --> 12:47.434
Look, I don't know
about you all,

12:47.434 --> 12:51.104
but I am tired of feeling small.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.439
I am tired

12:52.439 --> 12:56.209
of watching everything around me
fade and die

12:56.209 --> 12:59.546
because of
a bunch of rich outsiders

12:59.546 --> 13:01.514
pretending that I don't exist.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.951
They pollute our air,
they make us sick,

13:03.951 --> 13:06.887
they promise us jobs
that never come.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.022
I am done begging for scraps

13:09.022 --> 13:12.225
at my own table
and I know that you are, too.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.362
The parade is our chance
to show them who we are.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.531
How angry we are.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.969
And tomorrow...

13:21.969 --> 13:23.470
we will.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.541
(door closes)

13:28.541 --> 13:30.143
HASIL:
Hey, uh...

13:30.143 --> 13:31.144
Hey.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.379
I got you dinner.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.281
Um, was a bit of a long line,

13:34.281 --> 13:38.051
but I think I remembered
everything.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.954
I'm still a little nervous
about the money, though.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.890
I always feel like they're
taking more than they should,

13:42.890 --> 13:44.958
but I'm learning.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.094
You good?

13:48.561 --> 13:49.930
Let's just eat.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.598
I do something?

13:51.598 --> 13:55.568
No. Everything's fine.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.337
I can see that.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.279
Is it about the fighting?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.581
(sniffs)

14:08.581 --> 14:10.550
Look, we haven't
talked about it, really.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.985
I know you don't like it,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.420
but I'm doing what I got to do.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.022
This food wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for...

14:15.022 --> 14:16.156
It's not about the fighting.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.258
I like the fighting.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.161
But you...

14:21.161 --> 14:22.329
I didn't at first.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.031
I hated it.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.299
I was always worried
about you getting hurt, but...

14:26.299 --> 14:28.301
then I realized
that you're just doing it

14:28.301 --> 14:29.970
to make money to support us--

14:29.970 --> 14:31.338
me and the baby.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.241
How many fathers would do that
for their child?

14:36.576 --> 14:39.079
So, when I think about it,
I don't worry as much.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.083
You're like a warrior.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.585
(scoffs)
Hmm.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.120
(chuckles)

14:47.120 --> 14:49.089
To be completely honest,

14:49.089 --> 14:51.391
it kind of turns me on.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.396
It makes me want to be with you.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.432
In that way.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.301
Oh...

15:01.301 --> 15:02.469
I get it.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.572
-I like that way.
-(chuckles)

15:07.640 --> 15:10.577
I still don't understand
what you're so upset about.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.317
I just worry.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.618
Can't help it.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.589
Come here.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.624
Come here.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.063
What are you worried about?

15:32.099 --> 15:36.536
I think that every time
you walk out that door,

15:36.536 --> 15:40.173
just scared
you're not gonna come back.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.245
A lot of things to be afraid of
in this world.

15:45.245 --> 15:49.082
Not that, darling.

15:49.082 --> 15:53.153
It doesn't matter where I go,
I'm always coming back.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.288
(chuckles)

16:02.695 --> 16:05.465
(sighs)

16:08.001 --> 16:09.536
(sighs)

16:14.207 --> 16:15.408
(keys jingling)

16:34.327 --> 16:36.296
(sighs)

16:42.035 --> 16:42.735
(knocking)

16:43.636 --> 16:44.737
Shit.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.139
HAYLIE:
Sheriff?

16:46.139 --> 16:49.609
-Yeah?
-Sheriff, are you okay?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.078
I heard something break.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.451
What you doing in there?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.486
Uh, what?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.521
Isn't that Matt's area?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.156
Yeah, uh, but this is
all the property

17:03.156 --> 17:04.391
of Crockett County
Sheriff's Department

17:04.391 --> 17:06.493
and, you know...

17:06.493 --> 17:08.761
I mean, I'm the sheriff,
so I can go where I want.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.663
I just wanted to check in
with you about tomorrow.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.166
-About the parade.
-Yeah?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.301
That's all going well.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.535
I'm gonna have a few deputies
with me.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.636
And, uh,
we're taking care of it.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.272
So we're not expecting
any trouble from your sister

17:19.272 --> 17:20.607
-and her little group?
-Oh, no.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.209
No. No, not that I know of.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.743
Maybe you should ask her.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.446
Tell her
not to cause any disturbance.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.548
It's a family event, you know?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.383
Yeah, I-- I'm aware of that,
we're-- we're handling it.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.384
JEANNIE:
I'm sorry, Sheriff?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.519
Yeah, go. Jeannie, shoot.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.787
Um, we're getting some
noise complaints from an address

17:34.787 --> 17:37.357
over on Maple, a machine shop.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.192
Deputy Fults is busy with a DUI
over on Highway 7.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.261
Okay, damn,
that means I-I got to go.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.230
I got to take care of this.
Have a nice night.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.598
-I'll walk out with you.
-Uh, no.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.400
That's okay.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.236
I'll see you later.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.437
(door closes)

17:50.437 --> 17:51.671
(fighters grunting,
crowd cheering)

18:00.547 --> 18:04.251
(siren blaring)

18:07.554 --> 18:09.522
Hey, that's it.
Okay, clear it out now.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.659
You heard me, let's move.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.162
Evening, Sheriff.
Everything good?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.364
No, otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.598
I'm shutting it down.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.733
I thought
we had an understanding.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.535
We had an understanding,
which is you and your friends

18:22.535 --> 18:24.504
can beat the tar out of
each other as much as you like

18:24.504 --> 18:26.439
as long as you don't do it
in a residential neighborhood.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.641
-What? These folks don't care.
-These folks are calling me.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.243
All right,

18:30.243 --> 18:31.678
I'll clear 'em out
as soon as we've done

18:31.678 --> 18:33.546
this last fight.
It should be a quick one.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.515
Now, look, you--
you want to grab a beer?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.417
No, I'm on duty.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.419
But, you know what, I'm gonna
come in and take a look around.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.654
-You good with that?
-Now, Wade, you don't need...

18:41.654 --> 18:43.523
Wade, best you wait out here.
What...

18:43.523 --> 18:45.858
-Wade.
-(crowd yelling)

18:45.858 --> 18:48.661
(fighters grunting)

18:55.902 --> 18:57.470
Wait!

18:57.470 --> 18:58.505
Hold up!

18:59.539 --> 19:01.208
HOUGHTON:
Wait!

19:01.208 --> 19:03.210
(yells)

19:06.946 --> 19:08.181
HOUGHTON:
Wait!

19:11.584 --> 19:12.852
Hold on!

19:18.358 --> 19:20.627
Wait!

19:20.627 --> 19:23.330
(panting)

19:23.330 --> 19:25.265
Foster Farrell VIII!

19:28.401 --> 19:29.502
(breathing heavily)

19:29.502 --> 19:30.637
What about him?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.375
I know where he is.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.544
You don't know shit.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.680
It's okay.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.915
It's just my phone.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.422
Where'd you get that?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.524
HOUGHTON:
He got in a fight.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.925
He was arrested.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.562
They got him in the county jail.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.365
I have to help him.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.833
I need to come up there.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.635
I need to talk to your people.

20:02.635 --> 20:06.506
And I can't get up there
without you.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.641
They ain't gonna talk to you.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.780
It's the last chance
you have to save him.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.416
You don't help me now,
he'll be lost to you forever.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.830
HASIL:
All right.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.565
This is far enough.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.267
Why don't you wait here?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.436
I'm-a head on up,
get a read on things.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.470
(panting)

20:37.470 --> 20:39.872
No. No, I'll come with you.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.808
You drop in without any warning,

20:41.808 --> 20:43.543
it's just gonna be
worse for you,

20:43.543 --> 20:45.011
so why don't you do what I say?

20:45.011 --> 20:46.479
Sit tight, all right?

20:46.479 --> 20:49.549
How long do I have
to wait here for?

20:49.549 --> 20:52.752
The sun gets halfway
up that tree and I ain't back,

20:52.752 --> 20:56.489
then you get your ass
out of here as fast as you can.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.790
I mean that.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.894
(Houghton breathing heavily)

21:08.935 --> 21:10.370
(exhales forcefully)

21:10.370 --> 21:11.338
(spits)

21:14.707 --> 21:17.544
(knocking at door)

21:23.650 --> 21:26.319
-You let them Kinnah go free?
-Yes, sir.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.720
They sat there
for the longest time,

21:27.720 --> 21:28.888
like they didn't understand.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.424
But they finally wandered off.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.892
Was carrying the dead one
with 'em.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.327
Oh, well, then you follow 'em.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.528
Make sure
they don't circle back.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.563
Yes, sir.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.598
(knocking at door)

21:38.598 --> 21:41.701
BIG FOSTER:
Oh, well, well.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.869
Look who's here.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.036
What the hell do you want?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.472
I need to see the Bren'in.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.439
Oh.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.574
Is that Hasil?

21:47.574 --> 21:48.908
HASIL:
Yes, ma'am.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.611
You're sick.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.446
BIG FOSTER:
Wounded.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.814
Defending her people.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.815
Against who?

21:55.815 --> 21:56.849
Well, you would know that,

21:56.849 --> 21:58.418
wouldn't you?
If you were here,

21:58.418 --> 22:00.487
instead of down below
with your townie friend.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.655
G'WIN: Hasil.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.061
I found Lil Foster.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.830
(gun hammer clicks)

22:45.765 --> 22:47.099
I'm not armed.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.701
TREVOR: Well, that's
unfortunate for you

22:48.701 --> 22:50.470
'cause we are.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.005
BARNABIS:
You don't belong here.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.543
I know that, but I was brought
here to talk to your Bren'in.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.845
Brought up by who?

22:58.845 --> 23:00.480
By Hasil Farrell.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.014
BARNABIS:
We're gonna see about that.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.450
BIG FOSTER:
My boy

23:03.450 --> 23:06.586
locked away in a cage
like an animal?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.455
I knew I should've gone
after him. I knew it.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.491
You know this for a surety,
Hasil?

23:11.491 --> 23:12.959
-I do.
-BIG FOSTER: Yeah?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.461
-You see him locked away?
-HASIL: I didn't see him...

23:14.461 --> 23:15.828
but the, uh, the lawman

23:15.828 --> 23:18.197
that we chased off
a while back...

23:18.197 --> 23:19.198
he told me.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.833
The lawman?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.769
Oh, and what makes you think

23:22.769 --> 23:25.171
that there's a thread of truth
coming off his lips?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.806
He is our sworn enemy.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.208
And I believe him.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.610
All right?
I brought him up here

23:30.610 --> 23:32.512
because he knows
how to save Lil Foster,

23:32.512 --> 23:33.880
our kin, your son.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.015
No, no, wait a minute.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.817
Boy...

23:37.817 --> 23:39.819
what did you just say?

23:39.819 --> 23:41.053
You did what?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.822
He knows how to save Lil Foster.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.557
That should be the only thing
we talk about right now.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.694
Oh, I agree... only now,
thanks to your thick head,

23:47.694 --> 23:49.128
we got bigger problems.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.731
-How many are there coming up?
-Just one man.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.166
Oh, just the one
that you saw, huh?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.669
Probably a hundred more
following behind.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.138
Or you just too blind to see?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.008
It's one man.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.242
BARNABIS:
Big Foster, get out here!

24:03.242 --> 24:04.844
This could be them right now.

24:04.844 --> 24:08.147
You put him in the box, huh.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.083
He tries to run,
you shoot him dead.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.219
HASIL:
Don't touch me.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.659
BIG FOSTER:
How many are there?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.093
-What do you mean?
-The others.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.094
Give me their number.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.730
There's no one else.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.798
Hey, Foster!

24:28.601 --> 24:32.505
Talk now, John Law,
or never talk again.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.980
Got two seconds.
Tell me how many there are

24:40.980 --> 24:42.114
and which direction
they'll be coming from.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.783
Foster, there ain't no army.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.017
Will you take him out of here?!

24:47.587 --> 24:48.588
All right, time's up.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.189
I am done with you.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.224
EMELYE:
Foster! Stop!

24:52.224 --> 24:54.827
The Bren'in wants to see him.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.629
I don't want her dealing
with this. She needs rest.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.732
Your Bren'in has spoken.

25:06.873 --> 25:11.043
You show her every respect

25:11.043 --> 25:13.546
or I will send you
back down below in pieces.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.181
(under breath): Okay.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.849
Come on.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.788
-You ready for today?
-(Ledda chuckles)

25:22.855 --> 25:24.591
My daddy used to take me

25:24.591 --> 25:25.792
when I was a little girl

25:25.792 --> 25:27.259
to the Coal Days parade.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.062
It was a big deal.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.800
Even marched in it a few times.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.802
I am glad that
he's not gonna be around

25:35.802 --> 25:37.169
to see what's gonna happen.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.237
He wouldn't approve?

25:38.237 --> 25:40.206
(laughs)
Oh, no.

25:40.206 --> 25:44.076
He would ground me for the rest
of my life, even at this age.

25:44.076 --> 25:48.715
He was tough.
He was super pro-coal.

25:51.718 --> 25:55.287
Uh, listen, um...

25:55.287 --> 25:58.124
uh, that thing that happened
between us the other day...

25:58.124 --> 26:00.660
In the shower?

26:00.660 --> 26:06.198
Yeah, that.
Uh, it was, uh... not me.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.968
It was... very out of character.
I just...

26:08.968 --> 26:10.937
I enjoyed it.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.071
I'm sorry to hear
that you didn't.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.907
(chuckling):
Oh, no. God, no.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.810
No, I enjoyed it,
don't get me wrong.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.846
-Mm-hmm.
-It just...

26:19.846 --> 26:22.849
uh, it probably
shouldn't happen again.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.284
"It probably shouldn't"
meaning it possibly could.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.920
No. Really.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.022
Look, let's wait till
after this afternoon.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.157
If we have something
to celebrate,

26:31.157 --> 26:32.892
then we'll discuss it again.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.927
You are trouble.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.829
-(both chuckle)
-You really are.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.766
You have no idea.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.336
I know you.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.840
Yes... yes, ma'am, you do.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.943
Last time you were up here,
you led an invasion.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.244
It was not an invasion.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.847
It was an investigation.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.283
A man from the town
was killed on this mountain

26:57.283 --> 26:58.350
by one of your people.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.352
His name was Breece Dobbs.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.188
We were here
to apprehend his killer.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.389
Why are you here now?

27:03.389 --> 27:04.924
Because Foster Farrell VIII

27:04.924 --> 27:06.425
is in prison for that murder.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.195
Foster Farrell VIII
did not kill that man.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.897
I know,

27:10.897 --> 27:12.431
and I was able to prove it,
but things happened,

27:12.431 --> 27:13.833
things beyond my control.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.935
Now you, I mean,
you and your people,

27:15.935 --> 27:17.937
you're the only ones
who can save him.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.238
I could tell you everything
you need to know,

27:19.238 --> 27:22.909
but... I can't be involved
after this.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.977
Well, just tell us
what we have to do.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.445
HOUGHTON:
I'll warn you straight out.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.014
This won't be easy.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.949
You'll more likely fail
than succeed.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.317
Well, let us worry about that.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.920
He's being transferred
from a county facility

27:33.920 --> 27:35.922
that's quite near to here
to a state prison

27:35.922 --> 27:37.289
many, many miles away.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.959
Once he gets there,
to that second facility,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.093
you'll never lay eyes
on him again.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.229
He's gone for good.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.166
-Careful there, son.
-It's a map.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.935
Well, then you take it out,
slow.

27:59.211 --> 28:02.248
Now... he's gonna be
on a transfer bus.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.016
It's like a... it's a big car.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.985
We know what a bus is, jackass.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.788
Yeah.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.890
There's gonna be
a driver and a guard.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.091
Depending on the number
of prisoners,

28:12.091 --> 28:13.793
there could be a second guard.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.429
They will be armed...
but no matter what,

28:17.429 --> 28:20.332
you cannot harm
the driver or the guard.

28:20.332 --> 28:23.402
You can't kill them.
If you do that,

28:23.402 --> 28:26.305
you're gonna bring a whole raft
of new problems in on this.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.511
Do you... you know, want...
you want to write this down?

28:32.511 --> 28:35.982
We'll remember it. Go on.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.888
Here. This here's where we are.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.222
This is County Route 99.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.057
It's about five mile
west of here.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.260
There's a long, desolate stretch
here, and then a hairpin turn.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.497
-Mm-hmm. -That bus is gonna have
to slow down to take that turn.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.400
They're figuring to be there
this afternoon,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.002
and the sheriff's department

28:56.002 --> 28:58.037
is gonna have their hands full
with a parade.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.841
What if it's all lies?

29:02.975 --> 29:04.143
What if it's not?

29:06.879 --> 29:08.781
Why are you helping us?

29:10.249 --> 29:13.519
Because what happened to him
is wrong...

29:13.519 --> 29:15.221
and I was a part of it.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.924
Okay, well, it sounds like
you got more to tell.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.525
HOUGHTON: I wasn't the one
that wronged him,

29:19.525 --> 29:22.862
but I put him in contact
with people who...

29:22.862 --> 29:25.531
who wanted to harm him,
want to harm all of you...

29:25.531 --> 29:28.467
and I need, need
to make it right.

29:31.103 --> 29:36.408
Hasil... walk him partway down,
but you come back right away.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.010
We don't have much time to act.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.412
Yes, ma'am.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.582
Uh... there's, uh,
one more thing.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.485
The man who was killed,
Breece Dobbs,

29:46.485 --> 29:49.088
-he was my brother-in-law.
-I'm sorry.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.423
I need to know the whereabouts
of the man who killed him.

29:51.423 --> 29:55.427
I found his weapon
and a witness who told me...

29:55.427 --> 29:57.329
he's a big man,

29:57.329 --> 30:01.067
long, white hair.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.002
There's a lot of big men
on this mountain,

30:03.002 --> 30:06.939
plenty of them with white hair.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.341
You need more than that
if you're gonna get your man.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.110
Yeah, I got more than that.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.879
I also learned he's the father

30:12.879 --> 30:14.246
of Foster Farrell VIII.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.117
I come here, I helped you.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.452
I need you to help me.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.989
Tell me where I can find him.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.027
He's dead.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.432
Yeah. Good.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.537
That's it.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.618
DR. MEHTA:
Why did you do it?

30:52.618 --> 30:54.486
LIL FOSTER:
I don't know.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.190
Didn't feel like me.
Not sure I did do it.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.026
That's a sad excuse.

31:00.026 --> 31:03.495
That's the only one I got.
I'm sorry.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.998
It is the State of Kentucky

31:05.998 --> 31:07.533
Department
of Corrections' policy

31:07.533 --> 31:10.102
that prior to transfer
between institutions,

31:10.102 --> 31:12.905
violent inmates
need to be sedated.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.506
I need you to acknowledge
that you understand this.

31:14.506 --> 31:18.210
Is that what I am now?
A violent man?

31:20.446 --> 31:22.081
Wait, I'm-- no...

31:22.081 --> 31:23.615
I don't understand. What?
I-I don't want that.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.517
You don't have a choice.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.520
Wait, listen, Navin, I-I don't
want to be full of that poison.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.189
It's not poison.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.291
Listen to me.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.392
If I want to see my home

31:33.392 --> 31:34.493
for one last time,

31:34.493 --> 31:35.527
even for a second,

31:35.527 --> 31:37.596
I got to see it clear.

31:37.596 --> 31:41.300
I'm not gonna cause any trouble.
I swear it to you. Please.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.562
Just be calm.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.132
Do you understand?

32:15.101 --> 32:17.069
Thank you.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.517
Here, take this.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.989
Yeah, but I made this for you.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.290
-I want you to keep...
-No.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.627
Son, you take this.

32:41.627 --> 32:46.465
Much as you needed
this in here...

32:46.465 --> 32:49.401
where you're going
you're going to need it more.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.078
(knocks twice)

32:59.078 --> 33:00.579
*

33:11.723 --> 33:13.692
(door buzzes)

33:25.704 --> 33:29.041
(inhales deeply)

33:29.041 --> 33:31.009
GUARD:
Move it, Farrell.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.582
(engine starts)

33:36.582 --> 33:38.550
(indistinct conversations)

33:46.758 --> 33:49.195
(laughs)

33:50.362 --> 33:51.463
Hi.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.232
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

33:53.232 --> 33:56.235
-Hey, thanks for coming.
-Oh.

33:56.235 --> 33:59.037
-Hey.
-You, too. Thank you for coming.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.083
(marching band tuning)

34:21.727 --> 34:27.266
Lord, bless us with your spirit
as we stand together.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.701
We ask for peace and justice
for our families,

34:29.701 --> 34:32.371
and our community,

34:32.371 --> 34:34.573
and this mountain above us.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.442
Amen.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.610
WOMEN:
Amen.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.583
-You got this.
-Yeah.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.753
(clears throat)

34:54.326 --> 34:58.096
(coughing)

35:50.316 --> 35:50.882
*

35:50.882 --> 35:52.618
(ATV engines revving)

36:02.794 --> 36:04.596
DRIVER:
What the hell?

36:04.596 --> 36:05.697
You see that?

36:16.542 --> 36:18.444
DRIVER:
This is vehicle 6024.

36:18.444 --> 36:19.845
Requesting immediate backup.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.447
-(inmate laughing)
-County Road 99.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.515
14 miles northwest of Blackburg.
Over.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.217
-INMATE: Come on, baby! Come on!
-Shut up!

36:25.217 --> 36:27.185
(inmate chuckles)

36:28.754 --> 36:29.721
Come on, get on up here.

36:34.793 --> 36:35.627
Yeah!

36:37.263 --> 36:40.599
(marching band playing,
cheering and applause)

36:52.944 --> 36:54.780
DISPATCHER (over radio):
All units be advised

36:54.780 --> 36:58.617
that there is a possible 1098
in progress, County Road 99.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.387
Reporting five individuals
in pursuit, possibly armed.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.988
Requesting immediate backup
from all available

37:02.988 --> 37:04.890
law enforcement units.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.792
10-4, we're on crowd
and traffic duty.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.660
We'll send a unit immediately.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.667
Did you get all that?

37:15.667 --> 37:17.303
Yeah. What the hell's going on?

37:17.303 --> 37:18.804
I don't know.
You stay here.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.339
I'm gonna head up Corrections.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.474
Got it.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.743
*

37:28.447 --> 37:30.416
GUARD:
Pull over.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.418
It'll be easier to deal
with them if we're not moving.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.252
Bullshit, I ain't pulling over

One Planet does not care
about our children,

or our families,
or our community.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.884
That mountain is sacred,
and it is up to us

-Ledda.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.660
You are creating a public safety
hazard. There's kids

39:21.660 --> 39:23.128

-LEDDA: What are you gonna do?

39:23.128 --> 39:25.731
Arrest me? Huh?

40:35.601 --> 40:38.169
Open it! Open it!

40:38.169 --> 40:40.038
Open the door!

40:42.708 --> 40:45.176
Hey, keys. Let's go.
Come on.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.618
-You all right?
-Yeah.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.586
You see him in there, Hasil?
Is he all right?

40:54.586 --> 40:57.055
You got him?
Talk to me.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.123
Yes, sir.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.658
Well, hurry it up then.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.662

41:03.662 --> 41:05.897
Don't move.
Don't you move!

41:05.897 --> 41:08.066
You stay down there.

41:12.003 --> 41:15.073
(men groaning)

41:15.073 --> 41:17.509
Hey, you feel like a frog, boy?

41:17.509 --> 41:19.545
Behave yourself, you might
make it home for supper.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.781
-Yeah.
-(man grunts)

41:23.915 --> 41:26.718
(indistinct chatter)

41:26.718 --> 41:29.087
(laughter)

41:31.289 --> 41:34.593
BIG FOSTER: All right, come on,
come on, come on.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.533

What's the situation there?

42:24.342 --> 42:25.744
We caught one.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.278
The other two are long gone.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.881
