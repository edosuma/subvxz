any more cotton swabs?

from all of these

00:23.157 --> 00:24.757

00:24.759 --> 00:28.160
you probably know
something about this.

you can come up with?

Here, Alf.

At least we remembered
your cotton balls.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.574
What are you doing
with all this cotton?

00:42.576 --> 00:46.412
I've been experimenting
with some new menu ideas.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.347

00:48.349 --> 00:51.116
Yeah, I also tried
attic insulation

00:51.118 --> 00:54.586
but it left me feeling
bloated and unattractive.

00:55.956 --> 00:59.091
It's funny that way.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.759
But the cotton..

01:00.761 --> 01:02.628
Ah, the cotton!

of a fine polyester

unpleasant aftertaste.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.457
Ha..

02:38.459 --> 02:41.527
I wasn't watching TV.

Well, what are you
laughing at, then?

03:04.485 --> 03:05.851
that all this cotton
you're eating

03:05.853 --> 03:08.287
could be affecting your moods?

03:08.289 --> 03:10.722
Definitely.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.891
Don't you think you
should cut down?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.928

against cotton?

about our supply.

But this book here says

05:08.342 --> 05:11.043
there's this land called Alabama

where cotton practically
grows on trees.

to meet with him here.

That's a great idea, dad.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.404

when you're not smoking

12:08.328 --> 12:09.728

12:09.730 --> 12:12.330
is to figure out what to do
with your hands.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.698
Is there anything on that tray

12:13.700 --> 12:15.567
you don't want?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.641
So, how long have
you two been in this..

12:23.643 --> 12:25.744
...support group?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.312
Everybody, let's take our seats.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.747
We're late starting the meeting.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.715
Would you like to join us?

12:30.717 --> 12:32.150
Oh, no, thank you, Rita.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.686
Unfortunately, you, uh,
caught me on a good day.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.394
Everyone, we have
a new member with us.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.797
Willie.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.031
Hello.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.666
Hi, Willie.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.236
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.805
Would you like to tell us
what brought you to our meeting?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.173
Oh!

12:56.710 --> 12:59.477
I just thought I'd sit here
and listen if you don't mind

12:59.479 --> 13:02.547
it's, it's my first time.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.415
Well, Willie, the way it works

13:04.417 --> 13:06.718
is that everyone
takes their turn speaking.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.387
See that puts us all
on an equal footing.

13:09.389 --> 13:13.124
Besides there are some who might
resent you if you didn't.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.193
I know I would.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.631
Okay.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.965
I'm, uh..

13:20.967 --> 13:23.001
I'm..

13:23.003 --> 13:24.702
I'm, uh..

13:26.206 --> 13:28.606
I'm trying to quit smoking.

13:28.608 --> 13:33.011
Your wife told us you were
afraid to leave your house.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.346
That's right. That, too.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.449
Why do you think you smoke?

13:38.451 --> 13:41.352
[snorts]
Don't have a clue.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.555
Would you excuse me,
uh, just for a minute?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.260
Willie! Don't you know
how to knock?

13:51.565 --> 13:54.365
You were going to eat
that dish towel, weren't you?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.467
This?
Oh, I was just smelling it.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.503
Hoping for a contact high.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.738
[sniffs]

14:00.740 --> 14:03.174
If you would've eaten
that dish towel

14:03.176 --> 14:05.643
I would've been very angry.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.548
That's a sentence I never
thought I hear myself say.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.318
Where's Kate?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.853
She went to get more pate.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.322
But I told her there's still
half a can of cat foot

14:17.324 --> 14:19.624
left in the fridge.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.728
Alf, they want to know
why I smoke.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.397
Willie, you smoke?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.733
I want to help you, Alf,
I really, really do.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.269
But you have to want
to get better, too.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.204
Now, seriously

14:33.206 --> 14:35.974
why do you think
you need to eat cotton?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.242
I don't know.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.111
But surely you can't
be happy like this.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.248
You're right, I'm not!
I'm a wreck!

14:43.250 --> 14:45.149
Oh, Willie, I've got
a monkey on my back.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.584
It's a mean monkey

14:46.586 --> 14:49.053
and it's hassling
all the tourists for money.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.490
- Make him go!
- 'Willie?'

14:52.492 --> 14:54.459
Well, I hate for you
to see me like this.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.995
Is my mascara running?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.330
Okay. Okay, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.698
I'm gonna try to
steer the conversation

15:00.700 --> 15:02.800
around to something
that you can relate to.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.203
But this time,
you have to listen.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.271
You understand?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.473
Alright, alright.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.845
Hey.
Reformed smokers are the worst.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.683
Uh, I'm sorry.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.984
So..

15:19.986 --> 15:22.453
You want me to continue.

15:22.455 --> 15:26.190
Uh, well, I guess
my habit started

15:26.192 --> 15:28.760
as something that I, I enjoyed

15:28.762 --> 15:32.063
but then I,
I couldn't control.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.233
You know, that's how it was
with my hand washing.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.768
It was really fun at first

15:36.770 --> 15:38.836
and then suddenly
I just couldn't stop.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.942
Are you under a lot of stress?

15:45.845 --> 15:47.779
If you only knew.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.883
It's amazing you haven't
blown up like a balloon.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.651
Get off my back.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.589
You see, uh..

15:58.591 --> 16:00.692
I don't get out all that much

16:00.694 --> 16:05.330
and, uh, I think I must feel
kind of bad about that

16:05.332 --> 16:06.597
don't you think?

16:06.599 --> 16:09.434
Why, you afraid of open spaces?

16:09.436 --> 16:12.003
Or is it the crowds?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.805
And the germs?

16:13.807 --> 16:17.375
And the pushing and the touching
and the sweating..

16:17.377 --> 16:20.378
Ron, put that back. Be strong.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.114
This isn't the time
to backslide.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.949
You see, um..

16:26.586 --> 16:28.786
I, uh..

16:28.788 --> 16:31.656
I guess what it amounts to
is, uh

16:31.658 --> 16:34.659
I'm afraid I might be
seen by somebody.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.896
Because I'm not
from around here

16:38.898 --> 16:41.265
and, uh..

16:41.267 --> 16:43.267
...I don't think
people would understand.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.469
Where are you from?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.371
- Ohio.
- 'Ohio?'

16:46.373 --> 16:47.872
Hey, I'm from Ohio.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.441
Do you know Dr. Bisnick?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.443
Do you ever think
that everything

16:52.445 --> 16:54.712
is gonna come
crashing down around you

16:54.714 --> 16:57.915
burying you in an avalanche
of hopelessness?

17:01.154 --> 17:04.322
I don't wanna hog all your time.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.424
(Alf)
'Willie!'

17:06.426 --> 17:08.726
That must be..

17:08.728 --> 17:10.962
...my wife.

17:10.964 --> 17:14.165
Won't you excuse me?

17:14.167 --> 17:16.868
He's more messed up than I am.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.369
Wh-what is it, Alf?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.706
I don't know. Help me, Willie.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.542
I'm scared.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.511
Don't be afraid, Alf.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.380
Look, you want to eat cotton.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.183
Now, why? What's the reason?
Think.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.619
Please, just one bite
of your pants

17:34.621 --> 17:36.687
down by the cuff. I'm begging!

17:36.689 --> 17:38.556
No, no, you don't want that.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.025
- I do!
- No, you don't!

17:41.027 --> 17:44.262
For once I wish people would
stop telling me what I want!

17:44.264 --> 17:46.664
How do you know what I want?

17:46.666 --> 17:47.932
I want..

17:47.934 --> 17:50.401
Oh, I wanna go outside.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.371
I wanna see someone
who looks like me.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.540
I'm lonely, Willie.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.342
I want to go home!

17:58.344 --> 18:01.579
I understand, Alf.
I, I, I understand.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.749
(Howard)
'Willie? We're waiting.'

18:04.751 --> 18:08.219
I miss my family, my friends

18:08.221 --> 18:12.290
party games you'd never let me
play in a million years.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.591
(Howard)
'Willie?'

18:13.593 --> 18:16.194
I, I gotta go talk to Howard..

18:16.196 --> 18:18.496
No, d-don't leave me!

18:18.498 --> 18:20.164
- I..
- Please.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.532
I won't. I-I won't leave you.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.902
I'll be there in a minute,
Howard!

18:24.904 --> 18:28.272
I miss Saturday night
aphid chews.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.308
I miss my friends.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.710
Especially Rhonda.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.847
I remember one night
after harness racing

18:35.849 --> 18:38.416
she was helping me out
of my bridle.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.386
I had no idea.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.556
Alf, you always
joke about Melmac.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.926
Well, it wasn't
the most together planet.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.662
But still...
how'd you like to be

18:51.664 --> 18:54.599
the only member of your species?

18:54.601 --> 18:57.435
Sometimes I feel like I am.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.037
But you have a family, Willie.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.440
When you're, when you're
talking with little Eric

19:02.442 --> 19:04.408
talking that baby talk

19:04.410 --> 19:10.047
you look so, so,
so ridiculous.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.749
It makes me realize

19:11.751 --> 19:14.152
I'm never gonna be able to look
half that ridiculous

19:14.154 --> 19:17.488
with a little one of my own.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.357
You can be ridiculous
with our family

19:19.359 --> 19:22.627
anytime you want.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.629
And you are.

19:24.631 --> 19:28.533
Ah, just not the same.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.169
There's a bond that you have

19:31.171 --> 19:32.637
that I never will.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.739
[knock on door]
'Willie?'

19:34.741 --> 19:37.608
Alf, quick. Under the table.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.010
[knocking continues]

19:39.012 --> 19:41.712
'Willie?'

19:41.714 --> 19:44.415
- Hello, Willie.
- Hello.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.951
- Where's your wife?
- Kate?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.987
She's, uh, gone
to get more pate.

19:49.989 --> 19:53.991
Who was that yelling about
wanting to go home?

19:53.993 --> 19:56.761
Oh..

19:56.763 --> 19:59.063
That would have to be me.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.034
Isn't this your home?

20:04.971 --> 20:09.006
Yes. Yes, it is. Thank you.
I feel much better.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.876
Now, I can't help you with
the yelling at yourself part.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.513
That's more than this group
can possibly give you.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.081
He's right.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.250
I know.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.118
I understand. Thank you.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.788
And say goodbye to the others
for me, will you?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.890
Of course. Goodbye.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.259
This is going to disappoint Ron.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.300
I'm sorry you're lonely, Alf.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.702
Thanks.

20:39.639 --> 20:43.307
Well, eating cotton
never solved anything.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.311
There's another sentence
I never thought

20:47.313 --> 20:49.080
I'd hear myself say.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.150
You gonna be okay?

20:53.152 --> 20:54.719
I think so.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.821
Talking about it helps.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.089
Hey, you should try it.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.725
Maybe it'll help you
kick cigarettes.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.460
I don't smoke!

21:02.462 --> 21:05.863
Oh, so you can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.533
Come on! I've been there.
Talk to me.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.270
Don't dance alone.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.872
I'll remember that. Thanks.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.742
Hey, no sweat, and tomorrow

21:17.744 --> 21:20.411
go out and buy yourself
some new underwear.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.046

21:49.842 --> 21:51.575
Yeah.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.711
Being clean and sober's
gonna be a lot harder

21:53.713 --> 21:56.280
