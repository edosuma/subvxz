I don't care what he says.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.412
He's a convict! He's
a piece of garbage.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.806
I don't know anything
about this Michael Scofield guy.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.329
GUARD:
General.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.200
Here is everything we have
on the escaped prisoners.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.774
You don't know Michael Scofield,
is that right, Jorge?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.341
Yes.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.301
You sure you don't want to
change your story, Fernando?

39:58.004 --> 39:59.266
MAHONE:
Hey.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.530
This should help make
you a decent brace.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.402
Thank you.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.844
Hey.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.976
Should be able to see
them coming from up here.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.935
You know, Linc...

40:17.502 --> 40:18.938
you did great.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.248
Thanks.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.381
I just want LJ back, you know?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.470
It's just a matter of time.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.776
Yeah.

40:30.819 --> 40:32.995
Considering I don't have
a pony in this race...

40:34.214 --> 40:36.259
I guess this is where
I say good-bye.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.228
You think I'm gonna let you
just walk out of here...

40:48.271 --> 40:50.143
after what
you did to us?

40:50.186 --> 40:51.927
After what you did
to my dad?

40:54.582 --> 40:55.583
No.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.455
I was gonna kill
you at the beach,

40:57.498 --> 41:00.806
but I didn't want to
do anything that was
gonna get us caught.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.069
You shot my dad in the back.
I'm gonna give you

41:03.112 --> 41:05.811
the courtesy
you never gave him.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.595
Now turn around.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.512
Turn around.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.341
MAHONE:
Linc, think about
what you're doing.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.738
I was told to choose
between your family and mine.

41:19.781 --> 41:20.913
That was my option.

41:20.956 --> 41:22.436
I chose mine.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.439
Go to hell.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.398
Linc, you don't
have to do this.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.314
[glass breaking]

41:35.710 --> 41:36.581
Mahone!

42:08.961 --> 42:10.353
Hey! My truck!

42:11.659 --> 42:13.182
LINCOLN:
No!

42:25.238 --> 42:27.240
What are we gonna do now?
