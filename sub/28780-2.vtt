05:55.688 --> 05:56.889
- Perfect.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.992
{\an8}- Shading is when you use
a gradient from dark to light,

<i>and it brings out</i>
<i>dimension in pieces.</i>

06:07.600 --> 06:10.336

- A lot of work.

06:12.905 --> 06:16.542

to different shades, each team

06:16.609 --> 06:20.079

on an 8-foot by 12-foot canvas.

a lot of coffee today.

smooth shading with beans?

be in your opponents' hands.

06:32.692 --> 06:33.960
- We got this.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.863
- It's gonna take every single
member of your team to make

06:36.929 --> 06:41.567
sure you cover this canvas
with a huge, dynamic design.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.837
It needs to be legible, needs
to be visible from a distance.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.072
- Today,
you guys have an advantage,

06:46.139 --> 06:48.207
because you guys have
coaches that have been here.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.575
They've won.
They've taken it

06:49.642 --> 06:51.711
all the way to the finale
and cashed the big check.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.179
They know what
we're looking for.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.614
So, listen to your coaches.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.816
- Win this flash challenge,
and your team will have

06:56.883 --> 06:59.519
the power to assign
all the human canvases

06:59.585 --> 07:01.988
in the elimination tattoo,
which your coaches will tell

07:02.054 --> 07:03.456
you is a massive advantage.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.091
- Very true.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.493
- You have six hours,

07:07.560 --> 07:11.397
and your time starts now.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.133
- All right, ladies.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.736
First thing,
a couple ideas on what to do.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.104
- We have to show shading.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.472
- It should be
something simple.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.207
- One of the craziest things
about these flash challenges is

07:21.274 --> 07:23.743
<i>they force people</i>
<i>to think in a different way.</i>

07:23.810 --> 07:24.777
- We have to do something

07:24.844 --> 07:26.412
that's not only
technically impressive;

07:26.479 --> 07:28.581
we have to do something
that shows our creativity.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.583
{\an8}- What we're looking for is
these people to be able to turn

07:30.650 --> 07:32.885
{\an8}on the creativity switch
and do something amazing.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.787
- There's a lot of people,
and doing this group shit is

07:34.854 --> 07:36.489
really difficult when
there's so many creative minds.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.690
- Yeah.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.992
- This is my two cents,
is I would do a landscape.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.060
We would have
trees in the front.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.128
- Yeah.
- We'd have a middle ground

07:42.195 --> 07:43.129
and then the background.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.497
Lot of high contrast, maybe.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.998
- I don't want to sound like,
nerdy,

07:46.065 --> 07:47.867
but I took a class in Dutch
landscape in the Baroque Age.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.001
I know that's super specific

07:49.068 --> 07:50.603
and weird, but I
think I can draw something.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.971
<i>- It's definitely</i>
<i>nerve-wracking trying</i>

07:52.038 --> 07:54.340
to coach these women.
I've never met them.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.775
Do you want to put
a second tree right here?

07:55.842 --> 07:57.143
- Yeah,
if they can pull it off.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.212
Like, the skinnier ones further
back, and then they get bigger.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.646
{\an3}- Yeah.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.682
<i>We are dividing</i>
<i>the task equally.</i>

08:02.748 --> 08:04.016
<i>Some people are drawing.</i>

08:04.083 --> 08:05.484
<i>Some ladies are just smashing</i>
<i>the shit</i>

08:05.551 --> 08:06.552
<i>out of those beans.</i>

08:06.619 --> 08:08.054
- Anybody want to do
some recon real quick?

08:08.120 --> 08:09.088
- What do you mean?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.156
- Yeah,
just go see what they're doing.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.458
- Ash, you're good at that,
just go be cute.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.860
- No, bitch.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.929
- I just can't believe that my
fate is in these women's hands.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.098
<i>I have no clue</i>
<i>how good they are.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:20.700
{\an8}Man, I just hope
they can step up.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.169

a guy on our team's helpful.

08:24.503 --> 08:25.638

08:25.705 --> 08:28.074

a nice landscape with water.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.443
- I say, like,
a little beach type of thing.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.611
- You boys are
pretty indecisive.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.879
- Can we do both?

08:32.945 --> 08:35.014
Can we do, like, a shoreline?
- They're all good ideas.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.917
We just have to decide on one.
<i>Oh my God.</i>

08:37.984 --> 08:40.653

<i>a problem with commitment.</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:42.154
{\an8}Just pick one and go with it.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.258
