- Gregory, really
you flatter me so.

02:53.105 --> 02:56.614
Let's just see what
Gregory thinks of this.

03:01.614 --> 03:04.485
Oh, I think Gregory
is gonna like this.

03:06.485 --> 03:07.855
Yes, I do.

03:09.855 --> 03:10.292
Evelyn,

03:12.292 --> 03:14.574
darling you are divine.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.661
- I'm sorry to be quitting on
you like this, Mr. Carmichael.

04:22.661 --> 04:24.896
I really should've
given you notice,

04:24.896 --> 04:26.865
but life is changing.

04:26.865 --> 04:29.838
- No two week notice, no pay.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.007
You know you kids
are something else.

04:35.007 --> 04:38.911
Everybody wants to
chase their dreams

04:39.911 --> 04:42.701
while I'm stuck in this place.

05:01.701 --> 05:06.105
- It's not going to be the
same without you here, Lon.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.309
You'll come back to see
a movie or something.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.444
This isn't the last time
I'll see you, right?

05:12.444 --> 05:14.579
- I was hoping to
say goodbye to you.

05:14.579 --> 05:16.048
Of course not.

05:16.048 --> 05:18.283
I mean the new Annie move's
coming out soon, right?

05:18.283 --> 05:19.786
- You know it is.

05:19.786 --> 05:22.954
You won't forget me will you?

05:22.954 --> 05:25.091
- I can never forget that.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.028
That face it's quite a nice face

05:29.028 --> 05:30.333
quite the structure.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.601
Here.

05:36.601 --> 05:37.870
- Go get yourself a sweater

05:37.870 --> 05:41.406
'cause your uncle keeps
this place way too cold.

05:41.406 --> 05:44.543
- I'm not taking money from you.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.646
- It's not from me
it's from my dad.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.081
Think of it as a gift,

05:49.081 --> 05:51.684
and there will be
a lot more soon.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.819
- I don't want you
money or your pity, Lon.

05:53.819 --> 05:54.687
It's fine.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.521
I'm fine.

05:56.521 --> 05:57.857
- Please.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.726
- No.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.396
- Fine then be stubborn.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.466
- Spending your daddy's money.

06:07.466 --> 06:09.569
Is that his wallet too.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.137
- The Schumacher's are
moving up in this world

06:12.137 --> 06:15.274
Mr. Carmichael just you watch.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.776
- Not as long as
your daddy's alive.

06:17.776 --> 06:20.346
He was as tightfisted
as they come.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.648
Every family has its miser.

06:22.648 --> 06:25.651
- Well, he's pretty
close to death right now,

06:25.651 --> 06:26.887
Mr. Carmichael.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.922
- Oh,

06:29.922 --> 06:31.391
I didn't know.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.427
I thought those
were just rumors.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.932
Well, don't I feel like a heel.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.074
Give him my best.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.276
- I gotta get out
of here, Sarah.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.778
I'll be back on...

06:51.778 --> 06:54.547
When do we get the new Annie?

06:54.547 --> 06:57.949
- Lonnie, you can't let
my uncle get to you.

06:57.949 --> 07:00.319
That's just who he is.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.887
- Nah, it's fine.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.488
Besides I'll see you later.

07:03.488 --> 07:05.391
- Promise me you will.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.137
I mean I'll miss you.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.379
- Shelby, what are you doing?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.880
- What does it look
like I'm doing?

07:28.880 --> 07:31.050
- Well, I mean why
aren't you in the shade

07:31.050 --> 07:33.185
or under an umbrella
or something?

07:33.185 --> 07:34.259
This looks miserable.

07:41.259 --> 07:43.629
Shelby, this is warm.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.497
- Yeah, I know.

07:45.497 --> 07:48.500
- Actually it's not even warm.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.101
It's hot.

07:50.101 --> 07:51.336
- That's what happens

07:51.336 --> 07:53.906
when you don't have
a portable fridge.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.009
- Well, what about a
cooler filled with ice?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.612
- I don't have one
of those either.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.279
- So buy one.

08:01.279 --> 08:03.583
- What do you think I'm
selling root beer for.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.651
- For a cooler?

08:05.651 --> 08:08.860
Okay, now I've heard everything.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.396
Here take this.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.264
It's from my dad.

08:19.264 --> 08:20.966
- From your dad?

08:20.966 --> 08:24.538
Now I've heard everything,
but I couldn't.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.540
- Take it.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.410
- Since it seems so
important to you.

09:45.051 --> 09:49.221
- My
goodness, Mr. Frieze.

09:50.221 --> 09:52.926
Gregory, you scared me.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.494
- Forgive me.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.100
But it was you who startled me.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.769
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn,

10:04.769 --> 10:07.173
I dreamt about you last night

10:07.173 --> 10:10.142
in those early morning hours.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.812
I didn't expect
you here so soon.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.514
Of course I had hoped.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.383
- Oh, last night

10:17.383 --> 10:19.184
Last night, Gregory

10:19.184 --> 10:22.721
did you mean all of those
things that you said to me?

10:22.721 --> 10:24.222
Tell me that you did.

10:24.222 --> 10:26.726
Tell me that I wasn't dreaming.

10:26.726 --> 10:27.527
- Darling.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.163
- I had to come and touch you

10:32.163 --> 10:35.134
and feel you and
just prove to myself

10:35.134 --> 10:36.071
that you are real.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.640
That we are real.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.344
That last night
meant as much to you

10:45.344 --> 10:46.947
as it did to me.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.182
Oh, it's as if I'm alive.

10:51.182 --> 10:54.052
It's not just because I...

10:54.052 --> 10:56.255
It's not just because we...

10:56.255 --> 10:58.859
No, no it's not that.

10:59.859 --> 11:03.498
Gregory, I want to know
everything about you

11:05.498 --> 11:08.000
if you wear socks to bed

11:08.000 --> 11:10.735
on cold winter nights,

11:10.735 --> 11:13.009
if you prefer fiction
or nonfiction,

11:17.009 --> 11:21.313
if you are Earl
Grey man.

11:22.313 --> 11:23.287
- Darling.

11:39.164 --> 11:41.033
- What's wrong?

11:41.033 --> 11:45.238
- I'm not in the habit of
seducing married women.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.273
- I know.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.311
No of course not.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.048
- I made an exception
with you, Evelyn

11:57.048 --> 11:59.284
and not just because
of your generosity.

11:59.284 --> 12:03.054
And those golf clubs
are a terrific.

12:03.054 --> 12:07.993
No, no, I made the exception
because of your husband

12:07.993 --> 12:09.099
and his condition.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.403
Everything on track
with that, right?

12:17.403 --> 12:21.173
- Gregory, you asked
me this last night,

12:21.173 --> 12:24.844
and I told you everything
was on track then

12:24.844 --> 12:27.414
and everything is on track now.

12:29.414 --> 12:31.120
His death is imminent.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.655
I'm surprised I haven't
gotten a phone call

12:37.655 --> 12:39.057
with the news by now.

12:39.057 --> 12:42.197
- I'm sorry to badger
you truly I am.

12:45.197 --> 12:48.434
You've been such a
long suffering woman

12:49.434 --> 12:53.576
a saint really a beautiful

12:57.576 --> 12:58.879
- Wait, wait.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.149
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:04.149 --> 13:05.618
There's something.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.368
I have something I
want to give you.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.937
How about that?

13:24.937 --> 13:27.573
In case you want to surprise me

13:28.573 --> 13:29.876
with flowers.

13:31.876 --> 13:34.013
Tulips are lovely.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.650
Or chocolate.

13:38.650 --> 13:39.287
I prefer dark.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.489
- But your son?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.225
- Lonnie.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.760
He sleeps like the dead,

13:48.760 --> 13:53.499
and besides it's only until
you and I can make more

13:53.499 --> 13:55.639
permanent arrangements.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.381
- Oh, my.

14:10.381 --> 14:13.152
I didn't mean to interrupt.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.721
I am looking for a shawl.

14:15.721 --> 14:18.557
How long till you close?

14:18.557 --> 14:21.092
- We close in eight minutes.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.630
- Here let me help
you with that.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.532
What are you doing
out here, Shelby?

15:00.532 --> 15:03.769
- Well, I was selling root beer.

15:03.769 --> 15:06.672
- This is certainly
the day for it.

15:06.672 --> 15:07.940
- Which is why I thought

15:07.940 --> 15:10.809
I would have more
than one customer.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.312
- Take this.

15:13.312 --> 15:17.048
Then you can say you had
two customers for the day.

15:17.048 --> 15:19.551
- Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.821
- Let's not get
all sappy about it.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.090
Consider it a gift
from my husband

15:25.090 --> 15:27.529
for your entrepreneurial
endeavors.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.664
How's your grandmother, Shelby?

15:32.664 --> 15:34.399
I heard she was ill.

15:34.399 --> 15:35.801
- She is.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.303
- I'm sorry.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.671
Will you give her my best?

15:38.671 --> 15:39.573
- I will.

15:42.573 --> 15:45.009
- Mrs.
Schumacher, your flag.

15:45.009 --> 15:47.448
- Oh, you keep it, Shelby.

- It's brilliant.

16:37.296 --> 16:41.400
- But let me guess you're
waiting another week.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.471
- Hell no today is the day.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.073
- Good.

16:49.073 --> 16:52.177
I've had the contract
drawn up for a month now.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.912
- And I have the signature.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.249
My father should've been a
doctor for how legible it is.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.687
- Even better let's get
this thing finalized.

17:02.687 --> 17:05.057
By the way I've got a surprise

for you waiting in the office.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.147
- Do you now.

17:30.148 --> 17:32.518
- How many hours have
you put in helping others

17:32.518 --> 17:34.219
and volunteering
in the community

17:34.219 --> 17:36.288
not to mention raising a son?

17:36.288 --> 17:38.490
No, no, no that is no excuse.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.991
No excuse.

17:39.991 --> 17:42.928
It is not fair making a
wife beg for every penny.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.497
Making her live on
rummage sale leftovers

17:45.497 --> 17:47.665
and giving her a budget
that a cloister nun

17:47.665 --> 17:52.070
couldn't live on much
less a wife and a mother.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.474
Didn't I tell you
not to marry him?

17:56.474 --> 17:57.942
- You did, and

17:57.942 --> 18:00.211
and you were right.

18:00.211 --> 18:03.248
He's stingy there's
no doubt about it.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.887
But he was thoughtful when
we first started dating.

18:09.887 --> 18:11.722
Do you remember that time

18:11.722 --> 18:13.291
when he came to my door step

18:13.291 --> 18:15.627
with fresh red roses?

18:16.627 --> 18:18.832
- And you hate red roses.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.667
And he swiped those from
the Garcia's garden.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.135
- He didn't know.

18:24.135 --> 18:26.704
- And he still doesn't know.

18:26.704 --> 18:30.675
Evelyn, he doesn't know a
thing about who you are.

18:30.675 --> 18:32.743
- Well, he should know
we've been married

18:32.743 --> 18:35.279
for two and a half decades.

18:35.279 --> 18:39.251
- What did he hijack for
your last anniversary?

18:40.251 --> 18:41.920
- Roses.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.689
- Look sweetie I
don't blame you.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.357
It's not your fault.

18:46.357 --> 18:48.228
I blame your mother.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.395
You know her neighbor
that bank teller woman

18:51.395 --> 18:53.030
that couldn't keep a secret

18:53.030 --> 18:55.701
if it was pinned to the
under side of her bra.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.502
Well, if she hadn't
told your mother

18:57.502 --> 18:59.538
about his growing bank account,

18:59.538 --> 19:01.640
your mother would've
slammed the door on him

19:01.640 --> 19:03.510
and those damn roses.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.614
- Well, it's almost over now.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.883
The doctor gave him a day,

19:10.883 --> 19:12.986
I mean hours really.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.188
The next 25 years

19:16.188 --> 19:19.893
should certainly make
up for the last 25.

19:20.893 --> 19:25.698
Don't say anything
yet, but I think that

19:26.698 --> 19:29.636
Gregory is gonna
ask me to marry him.

19:31.636 --> 19:33.005
Listen, Trudy

19:33.005 --> 19:36.508
I have got to stop
procrastinating.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.114
I'm on my way over to the
hospital to say goodbye to him.

19:42.114 --> 19:46.417
- Well, be sure to tell him
that I said good riddance.

19:46.417 --> 19:50.855
- A city slicker came
in yesterday offered
to pay me cash.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.558
- Not that you would've
sold it to him.

19:53.558 --> 19:56.862
- Oh, make no mistake, Lonnie

19:56.862 --> 20:00.499
I am available to
the highest bidder.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.334
- Margot, in a couple of days

20:02.334 --> 20:05.170
I'm gonna be out bidding
every one of them.

20:05.170 --> 20:09.241
- And as of now you still
have all my affections.

20:10.241 --> 20:12.778
Are you ready for your surprise?

20:12.778 --> 20:13.213
- Here, now

20:15.213 --> 20:16.548
in broad daylight?

20:16.548 --> 20:19.017
- It's a print, Lonnie

20:19.017 --> 20:19.885
a print.

20:20.885 --> 20:21.154
- No.

20:23.154 --> 20:24.123
You didn't.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.924
- Oh, I did.

20:26.924 --> 20:29.394
Lonnie Schumacher,
may I present you with

20:29.394 --> 20:32.864
an original and signed
Patrick Van Spencer

20:32.864 --> 20:36.934
commemorating one of the
greatest musicals of all time.

20:36.934 --> 20:38.936
- I've never seen
anything like this.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.605
It's breathtaking.

20:40.605 --> 20:42.540
The minimalism is innovating,

20:42.540 --> 20:45.143
inspiring, and
thought provoking.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.346
- Well, the artist
is clearly a genius.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.881
- Clearly.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.118
But what musical was it from?

20:54.118 --> 20:56.355
- What kind of dolt are you?

20:56.355 --> 20:57.356
Grease.

20:58.356 --> 21:00.493
- Oh, right, Grease.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.462
Margot, I don't
know what to say.

21:04.462 --> 21:05.798
I owe you so much.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.636
- Yes, you certainly do,

21:11.636 --> 21:14.538
and I'm getting
tired of waiting.

21:14.538 --> 21:16.242
♪ Who knows

21:18.242 --> 21:20.444
♪ It's only just out of reach

21:20.444 --> 21:25.450
♪ Down the block on
the beach under a tree

21:25.450 --> 21:27.419
♪ I got a feeling
there's a miracle due

21:27.419 --> 21:31.423
♪ Gonna come true coming to me

21:31.423 --> 21:33.157
♪ Could it be, yes, it could

21:33.157 --> 21:37.561
♪ Something's coming
something good

21:37.561 --> 21:41.036
- Well, you're looking
rather refreshed, mother.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.337
- Thank you.

21:46.337 --> 21:49.808
You're looking
particularly vibrant too.

21:50.808 --> 21:54.046
Looks like it was
good for both of us to

21:54.046 --> 21:56.586
get out of here
for a little while.

22:02.586 --> 22:04.657
- What are you wearing?

22:06.657 --> 22:09.661
- Milan something or
other I don't know.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.830
I saw it in a magazine.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.432
- How much did it cost?

22:14.432 --> 22:16.002
- Oh, no, nothing yet.

22:18.002 --> 22:21.640
It's sort of like cloying,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.111
like gardenias in
a funeral home.

22:26.111 --> 22:29.047
Let's not order any gardenias
when the time comes.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.582
- Good point.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.086
We'll, get something cheaper

22:34.086 --> 22:37.154
or just skip flowers
all together.

22:37.154 --> 22:39.958
It's the way dad
would've wanted it.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.692
- You're not going to believe

22:41.692 --> 22:44.162
what I'm about to tell you.

22:44.162 --> 22:45.763
- Go ahead you can tell us

22:45.763 --> 22:47.833
because we prepared
for this moment.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.734
- But that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.435
His tumor was
growing at a rate of

22:51.435 --> 22:53.038
over a centimeter a week.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.240
This week that rate
had even increased.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.509
By my calculations today,

22:57.509 --> 22:59.111
tomorrow at the very latest.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.246
Well, as you know there
was no way to operate on it

23:01.246 --> 23:02.780
not where that
monster was located.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.116
- We know, we know.

23:05.116 --> 23:08.953
- And that's why we're
so darn prepared.

23:08.953 --> 23:12.022
- I don't think anybody
could be prepared for this.

23:12.022 --> 23:15.193
- Trust us we're
exceptional people.

23:16.193 --> 23:18.563
- He's dead already
isn't it, Dr. Rogers?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.398
You can tell us.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.501
- Quite the contrary,
Mrs. Schumacher.

23:23.501 --> 23:27.972
Your husband is going to
live, Mrs. Schumacher.

23:27.972 --> 23:29.807
A few hours ago he
went into a brief

23:29.807 --> 23:32.376
yet violent spasm so
I ordered another MRI.

23:32.376 --> 23:33.644
We didn't know what we'd find,

23:33.644 --> 23:36.013
but never guessed
at what we did find.

23:36.013 --> 23:38.517
That tumor has all
but disappeared.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.585
I've never seen
anything like this.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.753
The man is a walking,
talking miracle.

23:42.753 --> 23:45.723
You'd think it was Christmas.

23:45.723 --> 23:47.224
- A miracle.

23:47.224 --> 23:48.426
- A miracle.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.162
I myself have never
seen one before.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.063
Though I did hear about a
case at Pine Hill Medical

23:52.063 --> 23:54.465
where a woman who had been
paralyzed was walking.

23:54.465 --> 23:55.401
- We get it.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.868
He's a miracle,

23:57.868 --> 24:01.338
a walking, talking
4th of July miracle.

24:01.338 --> 24:02.606
Whoo-hoo.

24:02.606 --> 24:03.775
We get it.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.876
It's wonderful.

24:05.876 --> 24:08.705
When do we have to see him?

24:34.705 --> 24:38.609
- If it isn't my
two favorite people.

24:38.609 --> 24:42.948
Evelyn, you're looking
as well groomed as usual,

24:42.948 --> 24:46.118
and, Lonnie, you're
looking as scruffy as usual

24:48.118 --> 24:52.891
you little rascal
you.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.727
I know what it is they
don't know the news.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.864
- Well, you better fill them in.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.067
- Lose that frown.

25:02.067 --> 25:06.904
Evelyn, throw glumness out
the window, sweet cakes.

25:06.904 --> 25:09.340
I am a walking, talking,

25:09.340 --> 25:11.576
4th of July miracle.

25:11.576 --> 25:15.012
I'm gonna live for a
whole lot of years.

25:15.012 --> 25:19.584
Oh, it is my lucky
day.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.185
- The last nurse
did not indicate

25:21.185 --> 25:23.721
the color of your
urine this afternoon.

25:23.721 --> 25:26.991
Is it currently
running clear or yellow

25:26.991 --> 25:28.460
on a scale of one to five?

25:28.460 --> 25:30.127
- Well, let's see.

25:30.127 --> 25:33.932
It's clearer than
molasses in the fall,

25:33.932 --> 25:36.701
but it's not quite
as clear as the air

25:36.701 --> 25:38.038
on a morning in the spring.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.340
- Dad, are you on drugs?

25:43.340 --> 25:46.076
- Just
the drug of life,

25:46.076 --> 25:48.914
limb, and pursuit of happiness.

25:49.914 --> 25:53.050
- Okay, on a
scale from one to five?

25:53.050 --> 25:54.988
- Oh, two.

25:56.988 --> 25:57.025
- This is

26:00.025 --> 26:00.960
so great.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.461
- I know it's hard
to believe, mom

26:03.461 --> 26:07.634
but just think all of our
prayers have been answered.

26:09.634 --> 26:12.872
- You guys have
been praying for me?

26:13.872 --> 26:16.007
Hey, thank you Lord
for taking the time

26:16.007 --> 26:20.045
out of your busy day to
answer my family's prayers.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.680
- Last bowel movement?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.647
- On a
scale to one to five

26:23.647 --> 26:26.519
10.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.820
- The time of the event?

26:29.820 --> 26:30.124
- An hour ago.

26:33.124 --> 26:34.025
- Very good.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.160
Very good.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.494
It's been interesting,
Mr. Schumacher

26:37.494 --> 26:39.530
very interesting indeed.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.740
I wish you the best of luck.

26:49.740 --> 26:53.044
- Of course we've
been praying, Herby.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.413
We've practically
worn the floor out

26:55.413 --> 26:58.551
with our pacing and our praying.

27:00.551 --> 27:04.055
Never ever expecting
this day to come.

27:04.055 --> 27:07.858
You have to forgive me if
I seem a little stunned.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.262
It's just that

27:12.262 --> 27:13.067
It's just that

27:16.067 --> 27:19.971
well with the disappearance
of the brain tumor

27:19.971 --> 27:24.076
we've just never seen you
this exuberant before.

27:26.076 --> 27:28.646
- Well, you know if you've been

27:28.646 --> 27:30.548
as close to the river sticks

27:30.548 --> 27:33.917
and that money grubby
ferry man as I've been,

27:33.917 --> 27:37.656
you can really see the
wonder of this world.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.259
Evelyn, I'm a changed man.

27:42.259 --> 27:44.065
I am overjoyed to be alive.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.233
- You certainly
don't seem like the

27:49.233 --> 27:51.337
man that I left last night.

27:53.337 --> 27:54.507
- You know,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.377
when you guys came
in here I lied.

28:00.377 --> 28:02.346
You don't look great.

28:02.346 --> 28:03.517
You look like hell.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.688
It must have been
hard on you guys.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.191
Me being away so long, and

28:13.191 --> 28:16.596
you thinking this
was the last day.

28:18.596 --> 28:22.400
You know what I
wasn't gonna do this,

28:22.400 --> 28:24.671
but let's celebrate.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.641
Let's go all out.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.442
- You mean at like a restaurant?

28:31.442 --> 28:33.545
- Yeah, where else I
mean not gonna be any

28:33.545 --> 28:37.584
cooking for my sweetheart
tonight no sire.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.689
- Where do you wanna go?

28:44.689 --> 28:48.393
- The nurse gave me
a coupon for 40% off

28:48.393 --> 28:49.594
at the Chinese restaurant

28:49.594 --> 28:51.895
that's just a few
miles from our house.

28:51.895 --> 28:53.415
It is our lucky day.

29:11.415 --> 29:14.786
Isn't this grand all this food,

29:14.786 --> 29:17.154
all this time we're
spending together?

29:17.154 --> 29:18.455
If you noticed,

29:18.455 --> 29:22.329
I splurged on a second
box of kung pao chicken.

29:25.329 --> 29:28.866
- We were supposed
to go out, Herbert

29:28.866 --> 29:31.470
to an air conditioned
restaurant.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.038
- Out?

29:34.038 --> 29:35.240
When we can be here

29:35.240 --> 29:36.907
in the comfort of our own home

29:36.907 --> 29:38.376
with all of this.

29:39.376 --> 29:40.979
And don't think I didn't notice

29:40.979 --> 29:43.847
that you all had
the air on either.

29:43.847 --> 29:46.786
But it's back to normal now.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.321
That hospital was frigid.

29:51.321 --> 29:53.590
I can't imagine what their
electric bill comes to.

29:53.590 --> 29:56.693
Just about got a
sinus infection.

29:56.693 --> 30:00.632
It's a good thing I
got better when I did.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.769
- What would we ever
do without you dad.

30:12.109 --> 30:14.011
- Evelyn.

30:14.011 --> 30:17.414
- Of course it's
Evelyn who else would it be?

30:17.414 --> 30:19.851
How many women have
you phone number?

30:19.851 --> 30:22.088
- Three, but two
are related to me.

30:25.088 --> 30:26.026
- Sorry, Gregory.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.595
I'm not even making any sense.

30:30.595 --> 30:31.698
It's because

30:33.698 --> 30:36.705
something has gone
terribly wrong.

30:41.705 --> 30:44.241
The hospital waiting
room doctor came in,

30:44.241 --> 30:47.547
and then 40% off Chinese food

30:49.547 --> 30:51.550
and hospital slippers.

30:53.550 --> 30:54.087
- Evelyn, stop.

30:57.087 --> 30:59.159
You're really not
making any sense.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.727
- I'm sorry, Gregory.

31:02.727 --> 31:06.730
It's just because there's
no sense to be made.

31:06.730 --> 31:08.432
No sense at all.

31:08.432 --> 31:10.634
- Just

31:10.634 --> 31:14.939
Just meet me at the
usual place in an hour.

31:14.939 --> 31:18.777
I promise everything
will work out okay.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.078
Okay?

31:21.078 --> 31:22.145
- Okay.

31:22.145 --> 31:22.284
Okay.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.563
I'll meet you there.

31:38.563 --> 31:42.299
- Please, please, please,
please, please pick up.

31:42.299 --> 31:44.603
Why aren't you picking up?

31:45.603 --> 31:48.574
Why aren't you
picking up, Margot?

31:49.574 --> 31:52.676
Please pick up,
please, please, please.

31:52.676 --> 31:53.912
You picked up.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.779
- Yes,
unfortunately I did.

31:55.779 --> 31:56.614
What do you need?

31:56.614 --> 31:57.915
- It's over.

31:57.915 --> 32:01.118
All of our dreams
are over, Margot.

32:01.118 --> 32:02.953
- What do you mean?

32:02.953 --> 32:04.288
- Hey, we
have enough leftovers

32:04.288 --> 32:05.690
for dinner tomorrow night.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.292
It's our lucky day.

32:08.292 --> 32:09.493
- Can't talk here.

32:09.493 --> 32:11.561
We have to meet and
for heavens sake

32:11.561 --> 32:14.598
let's make sure
it's someplace cool.

32:14.598 --> 32:16.800
- You are not getting
in my bed, Lonnie.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.803
Stop asking.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.605
- Cut it out this is important.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.406
- Alright fine.

32:22.406 --> 32:24.142
We'll meet.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.076
Meet me where you first met me.

32:26.076 --> 32:28.046
You remember where
that is don't you?

32:28.046 --> 32:29.212
- Of course.

32:29.212 --> 32:31.249
- Good then I'll see you there

32:31.249 --> 32:34.761
in how ever long it
takes me to get ready.

32:44.761 --> 32:46.564
- Order up.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.107
- I took the liberty
of ordering you a beer,

32:57.107 --> 33:00.211
but it looks like you could
use a tranquilizer dart.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.346
What's so terribly wrong?

33:02.346 --> 33:06.984
- This is serious, Margot,
and it effects you too.

33:06.984 --> 33:09.388
- Nobody could've foreseen this.

33:11.388 --> 33:12.923
- What?

33:12.923 --> 33:14.157
What is it?

33:14.157 --> 33:18.997
- But it's the reality
we'll have to deal with.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.698
- What is it?

33:20.698 --> 33:23.634
- The doctor called it
a 4th of July miracle.

33:23.634 --> 33:24.935
But really it's a--

33:24.935 --> 33:27.739
- Disaster for my independence.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.741
- Would you please just tell
me what is going on here?

33:30.741 --> 33:34.945
- Herb isn't dead nor
will he be anytime soon.

33:34.945 --> 33:37.315
- My dad's brain tumor
disappeared faster

33:37.315 --> 33:39.616
than a BMW on the auto bond.

33:39.616 --> 33:41.085
There go my plans.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.720
There go my dreams.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.690
I was gonna open up something

33:45.690 --> 33:47.959
I don't know a
business or something.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.560
I didn't get two minutes
to think about it.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.597
- He'll out live
me I know he will.

33:53.597 --> 33:58.036
There never will be any white
sand wedge between my toes

33:58.036 --> 34:01.875
or warm turquoise waters
caressing my shoulders.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.144
Living with him was
hard enough before,

34:06.144 --> 34:10.614
but now after having
tasted of you, Gregory,

34:10.614 --> 34:11.985
of love

34:13.985 --> 34:15.353
- I said
order up 10 times.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.554
How many more times do
I gotta say order up?

34:17.554 --> 34:18.922
- Reign your
in, Joe.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.429
I've only got two hands.

34:25.429 --> 34:29.099
- I just can't go
back to that life.

34:29.099 --> 34:31.036
He doesn't love me not really

34:33.036 --> 34:35.773
not like he loves his money.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.210
- Get yourself together woman.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.579
There must be some mistake.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.481
That tumor was the size
of a Granny Smith apple.

34:44.481 --> 34:47.186
Something like that
can't just disappear.

34:49.186 --> 34:52.657
- On the contrary
apparently it can.

34:53.657 --> 34:54.760
- Evelyn,

34:55.760 --> 34:57.762
we've come too far.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.699
- We've got dreams yet
to dream you and me.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.534
- Which is why this
little miracle--

35:04.534 --> 35:07.440
- Is going to be
turned into a tragedy.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.018
- Hey, Josepe you might wanna
put out some more poison

35:22.018 --> 35:24.288
if you wanna get
rid of the big rat.

35:24.288 --> 35:27.625
- Hey, don't Josepe
me or I'll Josepe you.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.594
I'll take care of
it after we close.

35:29.594 --> 35:32.697
- Better put out one of
them industrial boxes.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.298
- I gotta go, Gregory

35:35.298 --> 35:37.534
before Herb gets suspicious.

35:37.534 --> 35:41.405
Buying day old bread
can only take so long.

35:41.405 --> 35:44.708
- Margot, I'm too tired to think
about this anymore tonight.

35:44.708 --> 35:47.679
- Evelyn, you
heard the waitress.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.182
We have a rat

35:52.182 --> 35:54.387
and that rat needs to go.

35:56.387 --> 35:59.523
You know what you have to do.

35:59.523 --> 36:01.860
Call me when it's over.

36:03.860 --> 36:08.099
- You've got to keep your
head in the game, Lonnie.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.201
You heard the waitress.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.240
Rat poison there's no other way.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.545
- I don't know.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.916
- Go on home, Lonnie.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.251
Get your beauty sleep.

36:28.251 --> 36:31.192
- Rat poison you buy
it at the drugstore.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.032
It's the only way you
and I can have a future.

37:51.534 --> 37:52.836
- Phlopsey's.

37:52.836 --> 37:54.838
- It was my mother's shop.

37:54.838 --> 37:56.706
God rest her soul.

37:56.706 --> 37:59.677
- So she just gave it to you?

37:59.677 --> 38:01.846
- But why talk about her.

38:01.846 --> 38:06.050
I want to talk about this
beautiful swan like neck

38:07.050 --> 38:10.221
and how it cries
out for diamonds

38:10.221 --> 38:13.891
to encircle its
elegant circumference.

38:13.891 --> 38:18.128
- Well, I wanna talk
about these shoulders,

38:18.128 --> 38:21.431
these arms, these hands.

38:21.431 --> 38:25.835
They should be gripped around
a leather stirring wheel

38:25.835 --> 38:30.510
with cruise control that
tilts in every direction.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.260
- After you.

38:59.737 --> 39:03.646
- I did not know that
water came in that color.

39:09.646 --> 39:12.893
Trip like that probably
cost a fortune.

40:13.543 --> 40:14.958
Okay.

40:27.958 --> 40:31.172
Two points.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.811
She must have won you at bingo.

41:12.036 --> 41:12.681
- Herb.

41:24.681 --> 41:25.052
Herbert,

41:28.052 --> 41:29.771
where are you?

41:59.048 --> 41:59.722
Herbert.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.570
- Hi, when did you get home?

42:19.570 --> 42:21.338
- Why didn't you answer me?

42:21.338 --> 42:24.288
Go back in there
get ready for bed.

42:50.266 --> 42:52.570
Herbert, I can explain.

42:53.570 --> 42:55.472
- There's no need
to explain, darling.

42:55.472 --> 42:57.942
You were just simply
checking our assets

42:57.942 --> 43:00.010
making sure that
everything was right.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.945
I'm glad you were able
to get along so well

43:01.945 --> 43:03.813
when you were alone.

43:03.813 --> 43:05.451
- Well, I have had Lonnie.

43:07.451 --> 43:10.454
- Hey, did you catch
the Cubs last night?

43:10.454 --> 43:11.023
Whoo-hoo.

43:13.023 --> 43:15.358
- You know he's
not as incompetent

43:15.358 --> 43:16.893
as you make him out to be.

43:16.893 --> 43:20.864
- Well, he's certainly not
a chip off of this old block

43:20.864 --> 43:22.101
if only he were.

43:25.101 --> 43:28.871
- You two have more
in common than you know.

43:28.871 --> 43:31.407
And he is plenty capable.

43:31.407 --> 43:33.777
- Sure, he's 23 years old.

43:34.777 --> 43:37.815
He still lives at
home because what?

43:38.815 --> 43:41.050
They won't pay him
what he's really worth

43:41.050 --> 43:42.853
at the movie theater.

43:42.853 --> 43:46.556
That's no reason to
question his competence.

43:46.556 --> 43:48.458
- Don't be cheeky.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.693
- Me cheeky.

43:50.693 --> 43:52.429
- Yes, you.

43:52.429 --> 43:54.398
You know you should've
encouraged him more

43:54.398 --> 43:57.434
when it came to
going to college.

43:57.434 --> 43:59.137
- I did encourage him.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.472
- You tried to strong arm him

44:01.472 --> 44:04.474
into being a Phoenix graduate

44:04.474 --> 44:06.175
so you could save a buck.

44:06.175 --> 44:09.213
- It's a legitimate school.

44:09.213 --> 44:12.416
- Not for a musical
theater major.

44:12.416 --> 44:14.952
Okay, look what
we've done for him?

44:14.952 --> 44:15.188
Zip, zero.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.690
We named the poor boy Lonnie

44:19.690 --> 44:23.559
after your grandfather
for Pete's sake.

44:23.559 --> 44:26.063
He deserved more from us

44:26.063 --> 44:29.233
if only to make up for that.

44:29.233 --> 44:31.235
- What we should've named him

44:31.235 --> 44:34.371
after one of your crazy
Hungarian relatives.

44:34.371 --> 44:35.972
- How many times do
I have to tell you

44:35.972 --> 44:38.141
they're not Hungarian.
- Besides

44:38.141 --> 44:41.744
he's already accomplished
half of his life's goals.

44:41.744 --> 44:45.585
He works in the movie
theater, doesn't he?

44:49.585 --> 44:51.922
- You are impossible, Herbert.

44:51.922 --> 44:53.724
You are never gonna change.

44:53.724 --> 44:57.094
You could've done so
much good with your money

44:57.094 --> 44:59.898
for your family,
for the community.

45:01.898 --> 45:04.501
I should've earned my own money.

45:04.501 --> 45:05.668
- For what?

45:05.668 --> 45:07.304
We have plenty.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.338
We're walking in tall clover.

45:09.338 --> 45:11.275
- But you choose
to hide it all away

45:11.275 --> 45:14.577
for some imagery golden years.

45:14.577 --> 45:17.981
- Our golden years and
they are not imagery.

45:17.981 --> 45:21.887
They're right there at
the front door right now.

45:23.887 --> 45:25.989
You know just a
half an hour of ago

45:25.989 --> 45:28.891
I was thinking of taking
you to a beautiful beach.

45:28.891 --> 45:31.360
- Oh, sure like you
were gonna take me

45:31.360 --> 45:33.896
to a restaurant tonight.

45:33.896 --> 45:36.233
You are impossible.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.744
I need some air.

45:47.744 --> 45:50.914
You have been a miser
your entire life, Herbert.

45:50.914 --> 45:52.516
I see that now.

45:52.516 --> 45:54.284
And it is because of you

45:54.284 --> 45:55.952
and your backwards
way of thinking

45:55.952 --> 45:59.722
that we are stuck
living in the dark ages.

45:59.722 --> 46:01.257
Well, no more.

49:05.309 --> 49:07.177
- You've been good to me, Lord

49:07.177 --> 49:09.213
really saved my skin this time.

49:11.213 --> 49:14.221
And I suppose I should say
thank you so thank you.

49:18.221 --> 49:20.958
And another thing, Lord

49:21.958 --> 49:26.331
be with me today as I go
through our family finances.

49:27.331 --> 49:30.666
Also let there be
no surprises today

49:30.666 --> 49:34.070
nothing that would
poison our fireworks

49:34.070 --> 49:37.077
or celebrations for
me or my family.

49:40.077 --> 49:40.791
Amen.

51:55.945 --> 51:56.181
Lonnie.

51:58.181 --> 51:59.228
Evelyn.

52:11.228 --> 52:12.036
Evelyn.

52:20.036 --> 52:20.648
Evelyn.

52:32.648 --> 52:35.052
Is everything okay down there?

52:36.052 --> 52:38.925
- Everything's just fine dear.

52:44.594 --> 52:48.565
- It's Margot from the
restaurant last night.

52:48.565 --> 52:50.967
I believe you mentioned
the exquisiteness

52:50.967 --> 52:53.802
of my neck if I
remember correctly.

52:53.802 --> 52:54.639
- Of course.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.141
Margot, Margot, Margot

52:59.141 --> 53:00.677
I dreamt of you

53:00.677 --> 53:04.347
and those explosive green
eyes of yours last night.

53:05.347 --> 53:06.916
- Really.

53:06.916 --> 53:08.083
- Would I lie?

53:08.083 --> 53:10.286
- I don't know would you?

53:10.286 --> 53:13.822
- No, but I guess you'll
have to take my word for it.

53:13.822 --> 53:16.726
- Well, I don't know about that.

53:17.726 --> 53:18.096
Gregory,

53:20.096 --> 53:21.965
I couldn't help but notice

53:21.965 --> 53:25.068
that we had a second
meeting last night.

53:25.068 --> 53:28.572
- Not the most
romantic spot in the world.

53:28.572 --> 53:30.840
- And I wondered if
you might be there

53:30.840 --> 53:33.677
for the same reason I was.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.945
- And what reason is that?

53:35.945 --> 53:37.114
- Insurance.

53:39.114 --> 53:42.085
- Not the most romantic
word in the American Lexicon

53:42.085 --> 53:44.954
but certainly interesting.

53:44.954 --> 53:46.789
- That's what I
thought last night

53:46.789 --> 53:49.025
as I replayed the
whole scene in my head

53:49.025 --> 53:52.762
as I lay alone in my
great big four poster.

53:53.762 --> 53:54.864
- The
words are becoming

53:54.864 --> 53:57.400
more romantic by the second.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.969
- But you still haven't
answered my question.

53:59.969 --> 54:01.070
- Which was?

54:01.070 --> 54:03.405
- Why were you
standing in aisle three

54:03.405 --> 54:05.708
of the drugstore last night?

54:05.708 --> 54:08.478
- Was that shampoo
and hair color?

54:08.478 --> 54:10.713
- I'm hanging up in three.

54:10.713 --> 54:15.485
- Don't bristle I was just
having a little fun with you.

54:15.485 --> 54:18.054
I was there for insurance too.

54:18.054 --> 54:21.958
A man has to protect
his investment.

54:22.958 --> 54:25.262
- Is that all she is to you?

54:25.262 --> 54:26.096
- What?

54:26.096 --> 54:27.465
- An investment.

54:28.465 --> 54:30.000
- Does it really matter to you

54:30.000 --> 54:33.304
or are you just having
fun with me now?

54:35.304 --> 54:36.507
- It matters.

54:37.507 --> 54:39.509
It's silly I know.

54:39.509 --> 54:42.581
And I'm not prone to silliness.

54:44.581 --> 54:45.983
But it matters.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.052
- Years from now when
we're sailing our yacht

54:49.052 --> 54:52.554
through the azure waters
of the Mediterranean

54:52.554 --> 54:55.925
we'll reminisce
how it all began.

54:55.925 --> 54:58.695
- And I have the perfect name.

54:58.695 --> 54:59.996
- For what?

54:59.996 --> 55:01.697
- Our yacht.

55:01.697 --> 55:02.532
- Oh.

55:02.532 --> 55:04.967
- Aisle three.

55:04.967 --> 55:05.969
- Oh.

55:05.969 --> 55:08.637
- Oh, articulate and hansom.

55:08.637 --> 55:10.572
- So I'll see you
this afternoon.

55:10.572 --> 55:12.976
- Maybe you
will maybe you won't.

55:12.976 --> 55:15.612
- Well, I'm picking
out a tie right now.

55:15.612 --> 55:16.114
- You should.

55:18.114 --> 55:21.052
- You know maybe today
I won't wear a tie.

55:23.052 --> 55:24.059
- Oh, very brave.

55:29.059 --> 55:33.701
- Nobody treats me better
than you, dear.

55:37.701 --> 55:40.836
Think I'll look at the bills
first take a walk later.

55:40.836 --> 55:43.239
- No, you can't.

55:43.239 --> 55:47.079
- What she means to
say is that the doctor

55:49.079 --> 55:51.847
the doctor told you to
go on a walk every day

55:51.847 --> 55:53.916
hot sunshine or rain.

55:53.916 --> 55:58.588
And well look at this
temperate morning we have.

55:58.588 --> 56:00.623
- And your
circulatory system has

56:00.623 --> 56:03.096
been ignored for far
too long, Herbert.

56:06.096 --> 56:07.831
- I suppose you're right.

56:07.831 --> 56:09.699
Heaven knows I
don't wanna end up

56:09.699 --> 56:12.001
back in the hospital again.

56:12.001 --> 56:14.436
- Don't forget these.

56:14.436 --> 56:15.637
- Thank you.

56:15.637 --> 56:17.373
- What's that?

56:17.373 --> 56:21.277
- Just a little
snack for your father.

56:21.277 --> 56:23.681
- But I packed him one too.

56:24.681 --> 56:26.349
♪ Who'd a fed the richest cat

56:26.349 --> 56:28.351
♪ The golden macaroni

56:33.556 --> 56:34.923
- Enjoy.

56:34.923 --> 56:36.483
- I will.

57:00.483 --> 57:04.052
- He really wasn't that
terrible of a father.

57:04.052 --> 57:07.061
I mean everybody has
their flaws, right?

57:13.061 --> 57:15.798
- His flaws are
killing us, Lonnie

57:15.798 --> 57:16.768
squeezing us.

57:19.768 --> 57:24.306
Rationing the air that
we breathe until I'm left

57:24.306 --> 57:27.277
gulping at what little remains.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.813
I just can't take

57:30.813 --> 57:31.615
not anymore.

57:33.615 --> 57:35.686
If he doesn't die, I will.

57:36.686 --> 57:37.521
- Mom.

57:39.521 --> 57:41.791
- I'm serious, Lonnie.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.726
So save your sentimentality.

57:44.726 --> 57:48.197
You can eulogize him
till your heart's content

57:48.197 --> 57:49.800
in a few days.

57:50.800 --> 57:54.139
As for now I need some help
getting into that bank account

57:56.139 --> 58:00.427
make it seem a little less
suspicious when he goes.

58:17.427 --> 58:18.927
Lonnie.

58:21.797 --> 58:24.568
What do you think you're doing?

58:26.568 --> 58:27.175
Lonnie.

58:33.175 --> 58:34.811
Come back here.

58:40.282 --> 58:41.652
Lonnie.

58:42.652 --> 58:43.954
Lonnie.

58:45.954 --> 58:46.858
Lonnie.

58:49.858 --> 58:50.101
Lonnie.

59:11.947 --> 59:14.717
- Here ducky, ducky, ducky.

59:14.717 --> 59:17.586
I know you're gonna
like what I've got here.

59:17.586 --> 59:20.789
But it is mostly
pure fat and sugar

59:20.789 --> 59:23.726
and too much sugar
could kill you

59:23.726 --> 59:25.894
at least that's what Nurse
Pruitt used to tell me

59:25.894 --> 59:27.262
when I'd ask for a

59:27.262 --> 59:30.666
- Herb, is that you?
- Second brownie.

59:30.666 --> 59:33.036
Marty,.

59:33.036 --> 59:36.572
Marty, hey it's
good to see you man.

59:36.572 --> 59:38.844
It's been a long time.

59:41.844 --> 59:44.847
See you my friend
you are looking good.

59:44.847 --> 59:45.914
- Me.

59:45.914 --> 59:47.516
Look at you.

59:47.516 --> 59:48.885
The last I heard

59:48.885 --> 59:50.652
you know things
weren't going well.

59:50.652 --> 59:52.789
- Well, you know they
tell me I'm the equivalent

59:52.789 --> 59:57.360
of a Christmas miracle just
six months early or late.

59:57.360 --> 00:00.429
- So was it the
whole brain thing?

01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:02.134
- Yes, but good as new.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.469
- You know,

01:00:07.469 --> 01:00:09.505
my sciatica's been acting up.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.007
- Oh, is that right.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.742
- Yeah, I'm thinking about
taking early retirement.

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:16.244
- Oh, well, it
worked out for me.

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:18.847
Although I didn't
really have a choice.

01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:21.250
When the plants merged
some of us had to go.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.952
But fortunately I had
just enough savings

01:00:23.952 --> 01:00:25.454
that we could make it.

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:27.724
- Savings what's that?

01:00:28.724 --> 01:00:32.061
You know those women work
against us all the time.

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.329
They need, need, need.

01:00:35.664 --> 01:00:37.302
Underwear, socks, shoes,

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:43.510
sandals, high
heels, flats, boots.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.414
- Are you gonna help me
correct this password or what?

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:54.349
- He keeps it taped
under the desk.

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:55.717
- What?

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:57.286
- He keeps his passwords taped

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.554
on a sheet of paper
under the desk.

01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:01.657
It's also got our
social security numbers,

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:04.896
shoe sizes, birthday
cake preferences.

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.666
- You have got to be kidding me.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:13.836
How long have you been
keeping this little secret?

01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:16.706
- Since I was like four.

01:01:17.706 --> 01:01:20.009
I didn't know it was a secret.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:22.110
It's where I used to play

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.715
so I could be close to him.

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.849
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:29.719
Do you know how
much time I have put

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:32.855
into trying to
find this password?

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.856
- Can't read minds, mom.

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:36.092
You've kept me out of this room

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.626
since the day dad was
put in the hospital.

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:41.496
How was I supposed to know
what you were doing in here?

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.469
- I swear if you hadn't
been bared straight

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:50.878
from my loins I'd
have a maternity test.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:56.016
Look at this.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.818
- How many hours of over time

01:02:02.818 --> 01:02:05.288
have we put in for those women

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.192
for our families
and what do we get?

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.862
We get a tie on Father's Day,

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.932
and sandals for our birthday,

01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:19.070
and a statue for Christmas.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:22.842
Whoopee.

01:02:26.842 --> 01:02:30.213
- My favorite color
is not chartreuse.

01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:34.182
- Evita is not one of
my favorite musicales.

01:02:34.182 --> 01:02:36.485
He can't keep stuff
like that straight.

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.788
Look at this one Chinese zodiac.

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:42.458
I was not born in
the year of the rat.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.992
You were.

01:02:43.992 --> 01:02:46.561
- I thought I was a snake.

01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:49.731
- Whatever what does
any of it matter.

01:02:49.731 --> 01:02:52.300
- You know there
sure is a lot of

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.904
useless junk for
sale in the world.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.606
- There sure is.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:59.007
- What gets me is that
some general manager

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:02.177
somewhere in some
factory decided

01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:06.682
that this piece of crap was
worthy of manufacturing.

01:03:07.682 --> 01:03:11.855
Somebody thought that
this was a good idea.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:16.759
- And somebody like
my wife or your wife

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:21.563
put down some hard earned
cash and what does it do?

01:03:21.563 --> 01:03:23.965
It just collects dust.

01:03:40.248 --> 01:03:43.619
- Goodness checking
account is low.

01:03:44.619 --> 01:03:45.356
- How low?

01:03:48.356 --> 01:03:50.525
- Not sure but it seems like

01:03:50.525 --> 01:03:53.762
overdraft covered some charges.

01:03:53.762 --> 01:03:56.998
- I didn't know
we had overdraft.

01:03:56.998 --> 01:04:00.001
- The bank gave it to your
father without charging him.

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:02.039
Probably knew he'd never use it.

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.943
- Well, why did it kick in now?

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:09.110
I don't know.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:12.621
I'm gonna transfer a
$1,000 from savings.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.523
If your father had seen this,

01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:24.860
I don't wanna think about that.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.063
- Maybe we should
let him see it.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.264
Maybe then we wouldn't have to

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.498
poison him.
- Lonnie.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:30.733
- What
don't yell at me.

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:32.902
- Oh, my
god, oh, my god.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:36.606
- Myra's turned me into
a slave for our stuff.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.940
Women.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.476
- Maybe your wife
but not my Evelyn.

01:04:41.476 --> 01:04:44.012
She is as prudent as they come.

01:04:44.012 --> 01:04:45.715
She runs a tight ship.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:50.119
She doesn't go in for all
that frilly nonsense either.

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.588
Nah, no not my Evelyn.

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.090
- My god.
- What.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.490
What, what is it mom?

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.226
Mom, what is it?
- Oh, my god.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:00.097
- 2842.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:02.931
- What do you mean 2842?

01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:05.568
- $28.42

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:10.009
that is what is left
in the savings account.

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:13.009
- Oh, no.

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:16.279
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.646
There must be some mistake.

01:05:17.646 --> 01:05:19.614
We had half a million
dollars in this account.

01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:22.217
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:05:22.217 --> 01:05:23.452
Oh, my god.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:24.853
- I can't open our closet

01:05:24.853 --> 01:05:28.324
without one of Myra's
needs falling out.

01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:31.527
When I ask her
about it she says,

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.728
"Oh, that old thing.

01:05:33.728 --> 01:05:35.266
"I've had it for ages."

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:41.072
- You know I did discover
something strange the other day.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.407
The closet you say?

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:47.746
- Dad is gonna kill you.

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:51.050
- Me.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:58.320
I didn't spend that
money Mr. Sports Car.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.222
- I didn't have
access to that account

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.923
Ms. Diamond Earrings.

01:06:01.923 --> 01:06:03.458
- Pearl.

01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:07.264
And those accounts are linked
that's what overdraft is.

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:12.902
- No, it still doesn't
make any sense.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.704
I only put a down
payment on that car.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:17.472
There is no way
that we went through

01:06:17.472 --> 01:06:20.242
half a million dollars
in three months.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:23.244
- It always starts
in the closet.

01:06:23.244 --> 01:06:26.449
You'll find bags
and wrapping paper

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:30.485
and price tags that have
been hastily ripped off

01:06:30.485 --> 01:06:32.922
and shoved into unusual places.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.023
Check your shoes.

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.358
- My...

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.094
I will.

01:06:39.094 --> 01:06:43.532
- He's gonna eat those donuts
and cookies for nothing.

01:06:44.532 --> 01:06:46.202
There's no money left.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:49.338
- But there's nothing
that we can do about it.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:53.376
He's probably eaten
every last morsal by now.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.813
You know what an
appetite your father has.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.516
Thank you.
- So it's over?

01:07:01.516 --> 01:07:02.585
- It's over

01:07:03.585 --> 01:07:07.293
except I've got a
phone call to make.

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.780
- I think I do too.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.264
- Was that Lonnie?

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.997
- Who else.

01:08:23.997 --> 01:08:24.966
- I'll give you three guesses

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:27.604
as to who was just calling me.

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:33.242
- Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.542
- You're a million.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.877
- We both will be soon enough.

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:41.582
What crisis do you suppose
those two are having now?

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:45.323
- Oh, Gregory, Herbert
has just insufferable.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.791
I can't figure out
the rat poison.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.260
It's just not cooperating.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.429
- Margot, oh Margot

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:56.265
give me the world
wrapped in a big red bow.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.287
I'll be taking a nap.

01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:22.024
- They're weak.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.323
- They talk a big game,

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:26.694
but when it comes
right down to it

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.729
- They're not gonna go
through it with are they?

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.000
- Of course not.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.676
- How much money
is at stake here?

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:46.983
- Well, from what Lonnie's
told me an easy couple million.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:49.618
- I knew it.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.854
Evelyn was cagey about
the exact number,

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:55.524
but we can't let this
slip through our fingers.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.467
- No.

01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:08.639
- I think it's clear.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:14.009
We've gotta take care
of our own pest problem.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:14.012
- We do.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:18.914
- Go big

01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:21.283
or go home.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:22.551
- To insurance.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.355
- Insurance.

01:11:29.784 --> 01:11:31.420
- Margot.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.988
Margot, open up.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:34.622
Margot.

01:11:34.622 --> 01:11:37.694
Margot, open up it's important.

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:12.363
- Gregory.

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:39.782
- You're sure Herbert's
favorite pizza is

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:42.951
pineapple, sausage,
and feta cheese?

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.586
- That's what Lonnie said.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.788
He'd pick one up every
half price Tuesday

01:13:46.788 --> 01:13:49.662
to take to his father
in the hospital.

01:14:02.637 --> 01:14:04.274
- They're not here.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.282
- Well, what do we do now?

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:14.587
- Not to worry.

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:22.190
- You know
red looks good on you.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.261
- Well, it is the color of love.

01:14:27.261 --> 01:14:31.368
You know I don't use
the word love often.

01:14:34.368 --> 01:14:37.739
Do you know how
beautiful you are?

01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:39.443
- I am.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:44.314
- You don't need
to wear this wig.

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:48.283
- What I don't...

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:50.685
What wig how did you?

01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:52.957
- Here will you hold this?

01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:56.859
- Yes.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:58.926
Yes, I will.

01:14:58.926 --> 01:15:02.931
Just hold on please

01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:06.503
I have very delicate
hands you know.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.773
- You startled me.

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:47.876
I'm getting into the spirit.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.177
Can I help you folks?

01:15:50.177 --> 01:15:51.613
- We're so sorry.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.349
We didn't mean to startle
you, Mr. Schumacher.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:57.019
- It is Mr. Schumacher correct?

01:15:57.019 --> 01:16:01.190
Because that is the name
that we randomly drew

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.529
for a 4th of July
deluxe pizza pie.

01:16:08.529 --> 01:16:10.699
- This is my lucky week.

01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:13.769
In lieu of a tip I'm
gonna go upstairs

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:17.972
right now and give you
guys a glowing Yelp review.

01:16:17.972 --> 01:16:19.942
- Don't let that pizza get cold.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.643
- I wouldn't think of it.

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:26.148
- Mr. Schumacher, you
enjoy Italian sausage,

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:29.350
pineapple, and extra feta
on your pizza, right?

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:33.689
- Ma'am, I never met a
free pizza I did not like.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.622
- Good.

01:16:34.622 --> 01:16:36.524
- Thanks a lot bye, bye.

01:16:36.524 --> 01:16:37.862
Pizza, whoo-hoo.

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.029
- Dad.

01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:15.734
Dad.

01:17:19.734 --> 01:17:22.114
Dad, don't eat those cookies.

01:17:33.114 --> 01:17:34.649
- It's too late.

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:35.884
- The police have
probably already

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:38.289
taken his body to the morgue.

01:17:42.289 --> 01:17:44.515
- Can they trace rat poison?

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:43.569
- What the heck?

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.140
- I'm exhausted.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:39.942
- Yep,

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:41.115
me too.

01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:19.042
- Well, if it isn't my two most

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.146
favorite people in the world.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:30.051
Evelyn, you're not
looking as well groomed

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:32.421
as ever this evening my dear.

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.692
Lonnie, same goes for you.

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.561
Okay, you two listen.

01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:44.164
Have a seat, sit
down, take a load off.

01:21:44.164 --> 01:21:47.601
The fireworks are
about to begin.

01:21:58.779 --> 01:22:00.448
- Italian sausage,

01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:04.193
feta, and pineapple my favorite.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.597
I'm famished.

01:22:16.597 --> 01:22:18.768
This feta is amazing.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.336
- I thought Italian
sausage, feta,

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.404
and pineapple was
dad's favorite.

01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:24.806
- Huh, no, no.

01:22:25.806 --> 01:22:28.510
I thought it was yours.

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:31.078
I prefer mushrooms
and onions myself

01:22:31.078 --> 01:22:34.082
but that is beside the point.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.251
- In local
news residents enjoying a

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.153
4th of July afternoon stroll

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:40.622
came upon a bizarre
sight at O'Reilly Park.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.091
At least two-dozen
squirrels lay dead

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.658
on the west end of the park.

01:22:44.658 --> 01:22:46.828
The CSI official who was
called into the scene

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.863
said he never seen
anything like it.

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:52.367
- They were
laid out like in two

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.770
concentric circles surrounding
the garbage receptacle.

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:59.541
It was like some
miniature toppled Stone
Hinge or something.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.376
- However
that's not the only strange

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.877
element in this incident.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:05.646
All the squirrels were
reported to have remnant

01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:08.350
of jelly donuts
and cookies hanging

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.417
from the sides of their mouths.

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:13.020
As a result both
squirrels and sweets

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.795
have been taken to the
Piedmont Lab for testing.

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:24.935
- I'm gonna need a
little Alka-Seltzer
here before too long.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.104
Son, have some pizza.

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:33.108
I'm sorry I could not
wait till you got home.

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:36.043
- Are those new pajamas Herby?

01:23:36.043 --> 01:23:37.244
They're very nice.

01:23:37.244 --> 01:23:40.015
- They're scrubs, Evelyn.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:40.016
Scrubs.

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:44.154
The nurse acquired them for me.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.555
- That's my pop.

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:49.123
Always saving a penny.

01:23:49.123 --> 01:23:52.627
- That's more than
I could say for you

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:53.864
and you.

01:23:56.864 --> 01:23:59.333
- What on Earth are
you talking about?

01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:04.204
- This is what I'm talking
about your outrageous spending

01:24:04.204 --> 01:24:08.045
when I was in the hospital dying
from a massive brain tumor.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.046
It took me a long
time to figure out

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:15.417
all of those expenditures
but I got them.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.951
- I only spent money on

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.520
basic household needs.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.925
- Basic
household needs, huh.

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:27.595
- Okay, well, maybe
one or two extras

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:30.301
but that is no
reason to get upset.

01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:37.538
I couldn't help myself, Herbert.

01:24:37.538 --> 01:24:40.176
I was just feeling
so distraught.

01:24:42.176 --> 01:24:44.179
The thought of you
being in the hospital

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:47.983
and just dying a little
more each day was

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:49.286
- Really.

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:54.354
Did the diamond earrings help?

01:24:54.354 --> 01:24:56.323
And how about the sports car?

01:24:56.323 --> 01:24:57.257
- Pearl.

01:24:57.257 --> 01:24:59.094
And the sports car was him.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.462
- Oh, and how about the

01:25:01.462 --> 01:25:04.231
professional teeth
whitening kit?

01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:05.734
- Her.

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:09.002
- And a time share

01:25:09.002 --> 01:25:09.139
in Detroit?

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:13.408
- It seemed like a good
investment at the time.

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:18.145
Hey, at least I didn't join
the stamp of the month club.

01:25:18.145 --> 01:25:21.750
- Okay, I'll admit it
I'm into philately.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:26.520
But listen, Herb, we
are not responsible

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.756
for the loss of
all of that money.

01:25:29.756 --> 01:25:33.694
Sure we spent a little
here and a little there,

01:25:33.694 --> 01:25:37.332
but there is no way
that we burned through

01:25:38.332 --> 01:25:41.337
a half a million
dollars in three months.

01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:44.538
- Dad.

01:25:44.538 --> 01:25:46.440
- No, no, no, no stop it.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.444
Haven't you done enough already?

01:25:50.444 --> 01:25:53.115
Harmonica lessons,
skeet shooting,

01:25:55.115 --> 01:25:56.757
hair waxing

01:26:03.757 --> 01:26:05.030
Irish linen boxers,

01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:11.766
polarized sunglasses,

01:26:12.766 --> 01:26:14.502
golf clubs.

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:15.104
Who in the hell

01:26:17.104 --> 01:26:19.810
plays golf in this family?

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:27.181
Lifetime theater tickets
to the Kennedy Center.

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.117
- Dad, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.217
I'll sell everything.

01:26:30.217 --> 01:26:31.189
I'll sell all of it.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.493
- We bought all that?

01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:42.597
I had no idea I spent that much.

01:26:43.597 --> 01:26:46.033
I truly did think it was
just a little bit here

01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:48.569
and a little bit there.

01:26:48.569 --> 01:26:50.003
My goodness.

01:26:50.003 --> 01:26:53.608
Who knew money
could go that fast?

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:56.845
- I worked for
that money, Evelyn

01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:01.114
I did without, I gave up things.

01:27:01.114 --> 01:27:03.652
And now, now look at us.

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:05.055
We are a joke,

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.858
a very bad joke.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.728
Evelyn,

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:17.265
last night you
called me a miser.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:21.435
And I'm beginning to
think that you were right.

01:27:21.435 --> 01:27:25.139
All my life I was saving
for one thing or the other.

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:27.243
First, it was marriage.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:31.047
But did I give you the
honeymoon you wanted?

01:27:34.047 --> 01:27:38.621
- Herb, I had a perfectly
great tan in Death Valley,

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:43.628
and that was the cleanest
Motel 6 we've ever stayed in.

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:50.201
- And then it was for a baby.

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:57.109
But there too I made you cut
every single possible corner.

01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:06.849
Like making you buy those
second-hand cloth diapers.

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.583
- What a great
conversation starter

01:28:09.583 --> 01:28:12.953
that turned out to
be at the laundromat.

01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:17.694
- I should've bought
you a washing machine
and clothes line.

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:22.229
- Don't give it another thought.

01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:25.867
I mean Lonnie and I
have very fond memories

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:29.538
of looking for quarters
and dimes in the sofa.

01:28:31.538 --> 01:28:35.947
- And now it looks like our
golden years are gone too.

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:42.717
If only some good

01:28:43.717 --> 01:28:46.188
could've come from my money.

01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:54.962
Something meaningful, you know.

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:24.226
Son, don't let that
pizza go to waste.

01:29:26.226 --> 01:29:29.963
Son, go get your father
a cool wash cloth

01:29:29.963 --> 01:29:31.604
and some ginger tea.

I do hope the good
Lord can forgive me.

01:31:32.752 --> 01:31:34.724
- Speaking of forgiving

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:40.131
Herbert, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:44.237
I had

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.511
I had an illicit,

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:57.650
immoral,

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:05.154
passionate affair

01:32:08.154 --> 01:32:09.591
but only once.

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:15.564
- How
much did that cost?

01:32:23.637 --> 01:32:24.725
- Everything.

01:32:45.725 --> 01:32:48.496
- Ice cold root beer
on such a beautiful day

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:51.631
now that's what
I'm talking about.

01:32:51.631 --> 01:32:54.502
Hey, listen I heard
about your grandmother.

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:57.003
I just wanted to let
you know that I'm sorry.

01:32:57.003 --> 01:32:58.104
Real sorry.

01:32:58.104 --> 01:32:59.073
- It's okay.

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.509
She got one last 4th of July.

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:03.444
She said it would
feel like a miracle

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:06.546
if she could see the
fireworks one more time

01:33:06.546 --> 01:33:09.051
with her cataracts
and all and she did.

01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:14.255
- Hey, is your sister working?

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:15.555
Don't you go anywhere.

01:33:15.555 --> 01:33:18.962
I'm gonna be right
back for one of these.

01:33:21.962 --> 01:33:24.234
- Here you go.

01:33:43.216 --> 01:33:45.988
- Well, wonders never cease.

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.389
- Come on, Sarah.

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:51.024
- Oh, don't you
come on Sarah me.

01:33:51.024 --> 01:33:54.328
You said you'd come back to
see Annie and it came and went.

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:58.332
to bad reviews I might
add and no Lonnie.

01:33:58.332 --> 01:34:01.135
- That's not fair we
both had a lot going on.

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:01.804
- I know.

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:07.108
I was really sorry to hear
about your mother and father.

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:08.809
Do they know what happened?

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:11.479
They said there was a
rash of it going on.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:14.180
Look what happened to
those poor squirrels.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.318
It's all so mysterious.

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:20.154
- They say it was some
sort of food poisoning

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:23.123
likely the feta
cheese in the pizza.

01:34:23.123 --> 01:34:26.627
If only my father hadn't
been such a big eater

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.729
or my mother hadn't
liked Italian sausage,

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:31.564
feta, and pineapple so much.

01:34:31.564 --> 01:34:34.034
It was her favorite.

01:34:34.034 --> 01:34:36.737
I was very sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.305
- It's okay.

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.640
She's in a better place.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.676
- That's for sure.

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.244
Speaking of being in a place.

01:34:44.244 --> 01:34:46.981
I'm in a pretty bad one myself.

01:34:47.981 --> 01:34:49.518
I really need a job.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:53.119
I've looked everywhere.

01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:54.488
I don't suppose your uncle

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.724
would give me back my old job?

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:59.359
I wouldn't be asking
if I wasn't desperate.

01:34:59.359 --> 01:35:02.462
- Yeah, that job's
gonna, Lonnie.

01:35:02.462 --> 01:35:05.899
But I hear the
manager's job is open?

01:35:05.899 --> 01:35:07.967
- Are are you serious.

01:35:07.967 --> 01:35:09.470
Did your uncle retire?

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.704
- Not exactly.

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.338
He quit.

01:35:12.338 --> 01:35:13.873
- Why?

01:35:13.873 --> 01:35:16.277
- My grandmother left the
theater to the three of us

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:18.779
as long as we didn't sell it.

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:20.881
She loved the theater.

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:22.682
I guess my uncle
worked all those years

01:35:22.682 --> 01:35:25.653
waiting for us to
sell it and cash in.

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:27.457
- Whoa, what do you know.

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:33.798
Today must be my
lucky day.

01:35:38.798 --> 01:35:41.534
Can you forgive me, Sarah?

01:35:41.534 --> 01:35:45.972
- I don't know I'll
have to think about it.

01:35:45.972 --> 01:35:47.507
- Please.

01:35:47.507 --> 01:35:48.176
