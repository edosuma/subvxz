00:23.857 --> 00:27.193
AND I'M AUDITIONING
AS LADY BRACKNELL.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.406
I GOTTA MAKE UP
FOR WHEN I BOMBED LAST YEAR

00:31.489 --> 00:34.159
AS SANDY IN <i> GREASE.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:37.829
- OH, HELLO, WILBUR.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.789
HE HAD HIS CHECKUP TODAY,
DIDN'T HE?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.791
WAS HE A BRAVE BOY?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.461
- HE WAS FINE.
BUT THE DOCTOR WAS AN IDIOT.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.130
HE SAID WILBUR WAS,
AND I QUOTE, "AVERAGE."

00:47.213 --> 00:48.673
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

00:48.757 --> 00:51.426
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT WILBUR
IS VERY ADVANCED FOR HIS AGE.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.428
- HMM. I'LL SAY.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.014
I NEVER HAD MY FIRST PIMPLE
TILL I WAS 12.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.226
- BABY ACNE IS A VERY
COMMON AFFLICTION.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.811
- AH.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.938
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND
WILBUR A NEW DOCTOR ALL MORNING.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.315
- YOU FIRED HIS DOCTOR
JUST BECAUSE HE SAID

01:05.397 --> 01:06.691
HE WAS AVERAGE?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.985
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY
HE'S NOT AVERAGE.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.987
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIS
SWEET LITTLE HANDSOME--

01:11.070 --> 01:14.449
WILBUR DON'T
SCRATCH YOUR PIMPLES.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.118
MY GRANDSON DESERVES
THE BEST PEDIATRICIAN IN TOWN,

01:17.202 --> 01:20.663
WHICH EVERY WEBSITE AGREES
IS DR. MALLIKA KAPOOR.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.332
- SO GO TO HER.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.001
- SHE'S SO EXCLUSIVE,
SHE'S COMPLETELY BOOKED.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.170
AND ACCORDING TO THE COMMENTS
ON THIS SITE,

01:27.253 --> 01:29.506
SHE'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT AWAY
IF YOU'RE FROM INDIA.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.342
- SO YOU NEED
TO BE A CLEVELAND INDIAN.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.723
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

01:38.807 --> 01:40.183
[laughs]

01:40.266 --> 01:42.227

WITH A BRIBE.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.103
I'VE HEARD ABOUT
THIS INDIAN CAFE

01:44.187 --> 01:46.022
THAT MAKES THE MOST
AMAZING SAMOSAS.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.232
- OH, JOY. COME ON, HONEY,
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING

01:47.315 --> 01:48.691
CARRIED AWAY?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.151
- I AGREE WITH MELANIE.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.445
I MEAN, ALL PEDIATRICIANS
ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.615
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
SHOPPING FOR EYE CREAM.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.202
- IF YOU DON'T
GET DR. KAPOOR,

01:59.285 --> 02:01.246
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
YOU'RE A BAD GRANDMA.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.666
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT FROM MUMBAI.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.502
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.338
I JUST NEED TO TAKE A BREATH
AND PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.417
{\an8}- YOU ARE FROM INDIA?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
{\an8}- MY FATHER WAS INDIAN.
MY MOTHER ENGLISH.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.754
{\an8}VERY, VERY FAIR.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.423
{\an8}- SOME ENGLISH BLOOD, HUH?

02:53.506 --> 02:56.926
{\an8}THAT EXPLAINS THE ACNE
AND THE CROOKED BABY TEETH.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.305
{\an8}THIS BABY DOES NOT
LOOK INDIAN AT ALL.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.474
{\an8}- I BROUGHT SAMOSAS.
- HMM. HOMEMADE?

03:03.558 --> 03:06.144

YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT COOK.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.773
{\an8}YOUR HUSBAND IS A LUCKY MAN.

{\an8}- OH, I'M NOT MARRIED.
OH, I SEE YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE--

03:14.694 --> 03:16.112
{\an8}- I SHOULD NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.947
{\an8}I KNOW MANY SPINSTERS
WHO TURN 40

03:18.031 --> 03:20.450
{\an8}AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY,
"NO MAN WILL LOVE ME,

03:20.533 --> 03:23.953
{\an8}BUT MAYBE A BABY WILL."

03:24.037 --> 03:26.623
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, WILBUR'S NOT MY--

03:26.706 --> 03:28.750
{\an8}40, YOU SAY?

03:28.833 --> 03:32.670
{\an8}- YOU ARE YOUNGER?

A WORLD-CLASS COMPETITIVE EATER.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.849

AND MEET A GIRL,

03:46.893 --> 03:49.145
BUT HE JUST STAYS HOME
AND EATS AND EATS AND EATS.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.939
HE'D LOVE YOUR SAMOSAS.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.649
- I'D BE GLAD
TO MAKE SOME FOR HIM.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.193
- WE ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION.
SHALL WE SAY FRIDAY NIGHT?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.195
- WHAT?

03:57.278 --> 03:58.821

- THESE WEDDINGS ARE GORGEOUS.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.630
-I THINK I FOUND THE WEDDING
PLANNER OF MY DREAMS.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.132
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM
THE WEDDING'S IN THE SLAMMER?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.637
- AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT,

04:22.720 --> 04:25.515
- VICTORIA, DARLING, ARE THOSE
GUEST TOWELS PRATESI?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.600
- OH, YOU HAVE
AN EXCELLENT EYE.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.061
SO LET'S TALK SOME MORE
ABOUT MY PERFECT WEDDING.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.854
- WELL, I WAS THINKING
AFTER THE VOWS

04:31.938 --> 04:34.190
WE'LL RELEASE
TWO DOZEN WHITE DOVES.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.192
- OH, NO, NO.
DOVES WON'T WORK, SORRY.

04:36.275 --> 04:40.363
WE'RE PLANNING
AN INDOOR CEREMONY.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.406
- YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
WHERE IT WILL BE.

04:41.489 --> 04:46.035
DOES THE VENUE
HAVE A YARD?

04:46.119 --> 04:51.499
- OH, THERE'S
DEFINITELY A YARD.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.544

I'LL NEED A NUMBER.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.213

[English accent]
A HANDBAG?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.862
- I'M GUESSING
THIS IS COMMUNITY THEATER?

05:20.945 --> 05:23.573
- MM-HM.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.575
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
WITH ALL THOSE MINOR DETAILS.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.076
- FINE. I'LL JUST
NEED THE LOCATION.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411

05:47.180 --> 05:48.723
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN PRISON?

05:48.806 --> 05:50.475
TO AN INMATE?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.643
- I MEAN, EMMET IS HARDLY
YOUR ORDINARY JAILBIRD.

05:52.727 --> 05:57.273
HE IS THE PROUD RECIPIENT
OF AN OSCAR AND A TONY.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.274
- [awkward chuckle]

05:58.357 --> 06:01.903
ARE THOSE AWARDS OR CELLMATES?

06:01.986 --> 06:03.738
SORRY.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.700
IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.452

I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.287

I'LL RELEASE THE DOVES.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.956

THEN WE'LL TALK.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.962

06:20.046 --> 06:21.798
- REALLY? DID SHE AGREE
TO TAKE WILBUR?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.299
- ALMOST.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.802
I JUST HAVE ONE
TINY HURDLE LEFT.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.137
SHE'S INVITED HERSELF
TO DINNER FRIDAY NIGHT.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.973
SHE WANTS TO SET ME UP
WITH HER LOSER SON, RAVI.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.392
- IS THIS DR. KAPOOR,
THE PEDIATRICIAN?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.811
- YES. DO YOU HAVE KIDS?

06:34.894 --> 06:38.064
- NO. THEY'D CLASH
WITH MY DRAPES.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.900

06:40.983 --> 06:43.694
EVEN CHILDLESS GAY PEOPLE
KNOW HER NAME.

- YOU WANT ME
TO PLAN YOUR WEDDING?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.283
INVITE ME TO THAT DINNER.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.993
- THAT'S IT? WHY?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.454
- IT'S EVERY WEDDING PLANNER'S
DREAM TO DO INDIAN WEDDINGS.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.083
THEY LAST SEVEN DAYS
AND SPEND A FORTUNE.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.376
KAPOOR COULD BE JUST
THE CONNECTION I NEED

06:58.459 --> 07:00.002
TO BREAK INTO
THE INDIAN WEDDING CIRCUIT.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.504
- OKAY, SO IF I MAKE
THIS HAPPEN,

07:01.587 --> 07:03.172
THEN I'LL GET
MY DREAM PRISON WEDDING?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.841
- TELL EMMET
TO SHARPEN HIS SHIV--

07:04.924 --> 07:08.136
HE'S GOT
A CAKE TO CUT.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.013
SEE YOU FRIDAY.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.392
- UH, ABOUT THIS DINNER.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.519
FOR THE SAKE OF WILBUR'S HEALTH,
I REALLY NEED YOU ALL

07:16.602 --> 07:19.981
TO BACK ME UP ON SOME WHITE LIES
I TOLD DR. KAPOOR.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.232
- WHAT KIND OF LIES?

07:21.315 --> 07:23.484
- WELL, I SAID
I'D BE COOKING WHEN REALLY

07:23.568 --> 07:27.822
I'M HAVING IT CATERED
BY AN INDIAN CHEF.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.740
- WHY? IF YOU CAN'T
COOK INDIAN FOOD,

07:29.824 --> 07:31.909
SHE WON'T TREAT YOUR GRANDSON?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.078
- THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

07:34.162 --> 07:38.541
I'M WILBUR'S MUM,
NOT HIS GRANNY.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.544
- SO YOU'RE DATING THIS GUY
BECAUSE HIS MOM THINKS

07:41.627 --> 07:45.423
YOU'RE A GOURMET INDIAN CHEF
WITH A FUNCTIONING WOMB?

07:49.093 --> 07:50.928
- WHEN THE TRUTH IS,
YOU HATE CURRY.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.473
- AND YOUR WOMB'S
IN THE SMITHSONIAN.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.606
- THIS HAS GOT
TO BE THE CRAZIEST LIE

08:01.689 --> 08:02.690
YOU'VE EVER TOLD.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.108
- ACTUALLY...

08:04.192 --> 08:07.945
[mimics Indian accent]
IT GETS A LITTLE BIT CRAZIER.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.124
- TOO MUCH?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.752
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
BUT IS IT NECESSARY?

08:22.835 --> 08:26.088
- I'M JUST TRYING TO PLAY UP
MY INDIAN SIDE.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.927
- YOU DON'T HAVE
AN INDIAN SIDE!

08:31.010 --> 08:32.886
- SPEAKING OF THAT,
IF DR. KAPOOR ASKS,

08:32.970 --> 08:34.429
WHERE DO WE SAY
YOU'RE FROM IN INDIA?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.722
- OH, NO.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.099
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.434
WHAT IF SHE ASKS ME
WHAT CASTE I AM?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.145
- I'D JUST SAY, "MISCAST."

08:44.982 --> 08:46.108
- SPEAKING OF CASTING,

08:46.192 --> 08:47.985
DON'T YOU HAVE
A CALLBACK TO GET TO?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.612
IF YOU LEAVE NOW
THERE WILL BE ONE LESS PERSON

08:49.695 --> 08:51.072
TO SCREW THINGS UP FOR ME.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.241
- OH, RELAX.
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.367
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.744
- OH, THANK YOU.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.747
- SEE WHAT
A GOOD ACTOR I AM?

09:07.546 --> 09:11.467
- MANU, THE FOOD
SMELLS WONDERFUL.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.844
- MM, I HOPE DR. KAPOOR
WILL LIKE IT.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.138
AND SHE WILL
TELL ALL HER PATIENTS

09:16.222 --> 09:18.641
AND MY RESTAURANT
WILL BE A GREAT SUCCESS.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.185
- I AM SURE ALL
OF THESE THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.562
- MM.
- EVENTUALLY.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.772
BUT TONIGHT, YOU MUST SAY
I COOKED THIS FOOD.

09:24.855 --> 09:25.648
- WHAT?

09:25.731 --> 09:28.276
THIS WAS NOT DISCUSSED.
I CANNOT LIE.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.695
I HAVE HONOR.
I HAVE DIGNITY.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.282
I WOULD NEED
AT LEAST TRIPLE MY FEE.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.533
- FINE.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.951
BUT I COOKED,
YOU SERVE.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.328
[doorbell rings]

09:39.412 --> 09:40.538
WAIT.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.455
DON'T OPEN IT YET.

09:41.539 --> 09:47.169
I HAVE A THING.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.088
NAMASTE.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.883
- LOOK AT YOU.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.511
I WORE A SARI
JUST LIKE THAT LAST HALLOWEEN.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.680
I WAS, "ANN CURRY."

09:59.432 --> 10:01.517
- AH!

10:01.600 --> 10:02.852
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:02.935 --> 10:04.478
- JEFFREY'S JOINING US
FOR DINNER.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.855
- YOU INVITED HIM?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.106
- I TOLD HER
SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.524
- YOU KNEW?

10:08.607 --> 10:10.693
- YES, SHE INVITED ME.
SHE KNEW, AND THIS IS TEDIOUS.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.069
WHO'S MAKING ME A DRINK?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.989
- I CAN DRINK.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.699
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

10:16.782 --> 10:18.993
I AM HAVING MY FIRST
AND HOPEFULLY LAST DATE

10:19.076 --> 10:20.911
WITH SOME TUBBY LOSER
WHOSE MUM IS DESPERATE

10:20.995 --> 10:22.038
TO HAVE HIM MARRIED,

10:22.121 --> 10:23.497
AND YOU INVITE
A WEDDING PLANNER?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.041
- WELL, I HAD NO CHOICE.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.710
IT'S THE ONLY WAY HE'D AGREE
TO DO MY PRISON WEDDING.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.379
AND HE'S JUST HERE TO DRUM UP
SOME INDIAN WEDDING BUSINESS.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.381
- I DON'T CARE.
HE HAS TO LEAVE RIGHT--

10:32.465 --> 10:33.299
[doorbell rings]

10:33.382 --> 10:36.719
- [mimics Indian accent]
OH, BLOODY HELL.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.222
- WE'LL BE FINE.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.517
YOU JUST DO THAT HINDU
THAT YOU DO SO WELL.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.564
- NAMASTE.
- NAMASTE.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.901
- OH, DOES THIS MEAN
YOUR SON IS NOT COMING?

10:51.984 --> 10:53.194
MAYBE?

10:53.277 --> 10:55.654
- NO, HE'S JUST DRAGGING
HIS HEELS AS USUAL.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.657
RAVI.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.659
- HELLO.

11:02.536 --> 11:03.871
- YOU'RE RAVI?

11:03.954 --> 11:05.998
THE COMPETITIVE EATER?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.043
- WELL, YOU KNOW
INDIAN MOTHERS.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.795
YOU WIN ONE
PIE-EATING CONTEST...

11:10.878 --> 11:12.254
- [laughs]

11:12.338 --> 11:14.090
- WHAT AN ELEGANT SARI.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.177
IT SHOWS HER LOVELY AND STILL
CHILDBEARING-IF-YOU-HURRY HIPS.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.765
- SHE'S EVEN PRETTIER
THAN YOU DESCRIBED.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.976
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.270
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOUR SON WAS SO HANDSOME.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.731
- IF HE'S SO HANDSOME,
WHY IS HE SO SINGLE?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.608
IT'S LIKE
HIS SOFTWARE COMPANY.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.318
WHY DID HE SELL IT FOR MILLIONS
WHEN HE COULD HAVE

11:34.402 --> 11:35.778
MADE BILLIONS,
LIKE APPLE?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.447
- WHAT? WHAT?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.414
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.333
- THESE ARE MY HOUSEMATES,
VICTORIA AND MELANIE.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.793
- AND THIS IS JEFFREY,

11:50.876 --> 11:52.586
MY SUPER TALENTED
WEDDING PLANNER.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.839
- IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU,
DR. KAPOOR.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.716
AND RAVI, WAS IT?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.009
- A WEDDING PLANNER?

11:59.093 --> 12:04.598
YOU REEK OF DESPERATION.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.767
I APPROVE.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.353
- LOOK, MY DELICIOUS FOOD.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.939
PLEASE, ENJOY.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.274
- YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.483
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME
A TOUR?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.819
- MY PLEASURE.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.447
- MMM. THESE PAKORAS
ARE DELICIOUS.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.449
WHAT'S THAT SPICE I TASTE?

12:21.532 --> 12:25.995
- OH, I COULD NOT TELL YOU
MY SECRET.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.832
- BELIEVE ME,
SHE COULD NOT.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.716
- I AM SO SORRY.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.676
- FOR WHAT?
- I KNOW MY MOTHER.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.844
I'M SURE SHE MADE IT CLEAR

12:41.927 --> 12:42.887
SHE WOULDN'T TREAT YOUR SON

12:42.970 --> 12:44.513
UNLESS YOU WOULD DATE ME.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.475
BUT CAN I ASK YOU FOR
A HUGE FAVOR?

12:47.558 --> 12:48.517
- WHAT?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.060
- COULD WE FLIRT A LITTLE?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.812
IT'LL GET MY MOTHER OFF
MY BACK,

12:51.896 --> 12:53.022
AND YOU'D GET THE BEST DOCTOR
IN CLEVELAND.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.148
- YES, WE CAN FLIRT.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.026
WE CAN TOUCH,
WE CAN DATE.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.029
PERHAPS SOMETIME
A WEEKEND AWAY.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.449
- GOOD FLIRTING.
BUT SAVE IT FOR MOM.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.702
JOY, YOUR WIT IS
AS SPARKLING

13:06.785 --> 13:08.913
AS YOUR LOVELY,
MISCHIEVOUS EYES.

13:08.996 --> 13:13.792
- AND MY EYES ARE FAR FROM
MY MOST MISCHIEVOUS ORGAN.

13:15.127 --> 13:19.590
- WHOA, THAT WAS QUICK.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.050
- WHY GO SLOWLY?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.219
YOUR FRIEND KNOWS
THAT RIPENESS IS ALL.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.722
TODAY'S FIRM MANGO
IS TOMORROW'S SMOOTHIE.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.480
BUT LOOK WHO I'M TELLING.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.738
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

13:42.821 --> 13:44.448
YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH RAVI
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.618
- I DO.
HE'S SWEET AND HANDSOME.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.869
NOT TO MENTION, RICH.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.579
I CAN REALLY SEE
A FUTURE FOR US.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.747
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.457
- NO, YOU KNOW
WHAT SOUNDS CRAZY?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.542
[mimics Indian accent]
YOU TALKING LIKE THIS

13:54.625 --> 13:56.585
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.839
- YOU WERE INSANE
TO COME HERE TONIGHT.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.092
- I DON'T CARE.
I LOVE YOU, RAVI.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.927
- AND I LOVE YOU.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.764
- RAVI, YOU'RE GAY?

14:08.847 --> 14:11.725
- GAY FOR YOUR SAMOSAS.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.983
- JEFFREY,
WHEN DID YOU COME OUT?

14:19.066 --> 14:22.111
- SWEETIE, I WAS NEVER IN.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.071
IT'S RAVI WHO NEEDS
TO COME OUT.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.155
- WHAT?

14:25.239 --> 14:27.449
- RAVI AND JEFFREY ARE LOVERS.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.451
- WILL YOU PLEASE BE QUIET?
MY MOTHER WILL HEAR.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.078
- SHE NEEDS TO HEAR.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.288
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR TWO YEARS,

14:32.371 --> 14:34.290
AND HE STILL HASN'T
TOLD HER ABOUT US.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.958
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE EASIER

14:36.041 --> 14:37.126
FOR HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH

14:37.209 --> 14:39.336
IF I MET HER
AND SHE LIKED ME.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.088
- IF I TELL HER THE TRUTH,
TRUST ME,

14:41.171 --> 14:42.840
SHE WON'T LIKE YOU.
- OR ME.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.466
SHE'LL BLAME ME
FOR BRINGING YOU TOGETHER

14:44.550 --> 14:45.968
AND REFUSE TO TREAT WILBUR.

14:46.051 --> 14:50.848
- WAIT, YOUR ACCENT'S GONE.
YOU'RE NOT INDIAN?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.519
- AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO'S NOT LIVING A LIE?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.771
- OH, PLEASE.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.189
YOU SAID THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANTED TO COME

14:59.273 --> 15:00.691
WAS TO PLAN
AN INDIAN WEDDING.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.985
- YES. MINE.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.321
RAVI, MY LOVE--

15:05.404 --> 15:06.614
- NO, STOP!

15:06.697 --> 15:08.824
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

15:08.907 --> 15:10.492
- [mimics Indian accent]
I LOST A CONTACT LENS.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.746
WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR IT.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.707
all: FOUND IT!

15:16.790 --> 15:19.501
- OH, THANK YOU, RAVI.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.004
I CAN NOW SEE
YOUR HANDSOME FACE.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.464
- I THINK THESE LOVEBIRDS
WERE TRYING

15:23.547 --> 15:24.548
TO STEAL A MOMENT.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.926
LET'S GIVE THEM SOME PRIVACY.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.722
- YOU MUST THINK
I'M A COWARD

15:31.805 --> 15:33.515
TO HIDE FROM MY MOTHER
THIS WAY.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.476
- WELL, IT WOULD BE NICE IF
YOU COULD TELL HER SOMEDAY.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.894
JUST NOT TONIGHT.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.021
- EVERY INDIAN MOTHER
DREAMS OF THE DAY

15:39.104 --> 15:40.731
HER SON GETS MARRIED
'CAUSE THEN SHE'LL HAVE

15:40.814 --> 15:41.899
A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
TO PUSH AROUND

15:41.982 --> 15:43.442
FOR THE REST
OF HER LIFE.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.069
- CAN'T SHE PUSH JEFFREY AROUND?

15:45.152 --> 15:47.029
- IF YOU PUSH JEFFREY,
HE PUSHES RIGHT BACK.

15:47.112 --> 15:51.909
OH, WHY DID I FALL FOR A MAN
SO GAY AND SASSY?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.705
- YOU'LL WORK IT OUT,
RAVI,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.707
AND WE'LL GET THROUGH
THIS NIGHT.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.000
WE JUST HAVE TO PLAY OUR PARTS

16:00.084 --> 16:03.045
AND NOT LET THINGS
GET ANY MORE COMPLICATED.

16:03.128 --> 16:08.842
- I WANT A DOUBLE VODKA,
AND I WANT IT NOW!

16:08.926 --> 16:10.678
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A CALLBACK?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.554
- THE PART WAS ALREADY CAST.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.682
- WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.058
THINGS ARE MESSY ENOUGH.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.559
RAVI'S BOYFRIEND SHOWED UP,

16:17.643 --> 16:19.353
AND HIS MOTHER DOESN'T
KNOW HE'S GAY.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.563
THE LAST THING WE NEED IS
YOU BARGING IN HERE

16:21.647 --> 16:23.107
POUNDING DOWN VODKAS

16:23.190 --> 16:24.942
AND WHINING ABOUT SOME PART
YOU DIDN'T GET.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.403
- WHY DIDN'T THEY PICK ME?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.698
- WELL, YOUR ACCENT WAS
A BIT INCONSISTENT.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.076
- YOU SHOULD TALK.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.079
- [English accent] OH, RUBBISH!
I WAS SPOT-ON.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.207
- OH, YOU'RE BRITISH.
YOU MUST BE JOY'S MOTHER.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.876
- [English accent]
OH. QUITE SO.

16:44.670 --> 16:49.007
THIS SHOULD BE JOLLY GOOD FUN.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.559
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE GOT THROUGH DINNER.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.811
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
ELKA WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING

17:00.894 --> 17:02.146
WITH HER STUPID STORIES

17:02.229 --> 17:04.106
ABOUT MY SUPPOSED CHILDHOOD
IN INDIA.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.733
- THAT LAST ONE WAS
JUST THE PLOT

17:05.816 --> 17:08.609
FROM <i> BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:11.780
- THAT WAS A FASCINATING STORY

17:11.864 --> 17:14.282
ABOUT DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE ROAD, ELKA.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.661
BUT PERHAPS DR. KAPOOR
WOULD PREFER

17:17.744 --> 17:20.414
TO HEAR SOME ANECDOTES
FROM A FAMOUS ACTRESS.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.457
- ACTUALLY, MS. CHASE,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.666
I'M A BIT OF
AN ACTRESS MYSELF.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.627
JUST TODAY I GOT CAST
AS LADY BRACKNELL

17:26.712 --> 17:28.505
IN <i> THE IMPORTANCE</i>
<i>OF BEING EARNEST.</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:35.304
- WHAT?

17:35.387 --> 17:38.140
- THE DIRECTOR ASSURED ME
THAT I WAS THE BEST CHOICE.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.477
ONE RIDICULOUS WOMAN
EVEN CAME IN COSTUME.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.645
HOW COULD SOMEONE BE
SO CLUELESS?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.648
- I'M CLUELESS?

17:46.732 --> 17:50.444
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR SON IS GAY.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.447
- THANK YOU!

17:53.530 --> 17:54.865
- WHAT?
- ELKA!

17:54.948 --> 17:56.116
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.702
- JOY, YOUR ACCENT.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.662
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

18:00.746 --> 18:02.331
- OKAY. I LIED.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.248
BUT FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.167
- SHE JUST WANTED
TO HELP HER GRANDCHILD.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.545
all: GRANDCHILD?

18:08.629 --> 18:11.173
- THEY DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT PART.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.801
- LET'S GO, RAVI.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.177
THIS WOMAN IS A LIAR,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.720
AND THIS GIRL IS
NOT FOR YOU.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.347
- NO GIRL IS FOR ME.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.557
THE TRUTH IS

18:20.641 --> 18:23.018
I LOVE JEFFREY.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.520
- AND WE'RE GOING
TO BE MARRIED.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.021
- MARRIED?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
- WE'VE BEEN HIDING
OUR LOVE FOR YEARS.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.359
- SO YOU MEAN I'LL NEVER HAVE
A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

18:30.442 --> 18:33.195
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THIS IS A BIT OF A SHOCK,

18:33.278 --> 18:35.155
BUT EVERYTHING'S OUT
IN THE OPEN NOW.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.366
NO MORE SECRETS,
NO MORE LIES.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.161
- WHO WANTS SOME OF JOY'S
FAMOUS RASKADAMBAS?

18:41.245 --> 18:42.538
- RAVI, WE'RE LEAVING.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.331
- PLEASE, WAIT.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.499
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

18:45.582 --> 18:47.626
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE
WILBUR'S DOCTOR.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.169
HE MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.004
I GAVE UP HIS DAD
FOR ADOPTION

18:51.088 --> 18:53.215
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.218
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GUILTY
THAT MAKES A WOMAN FEEL.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.720
- ACTUALLY, MS. SCROGGS,
I DO.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.223
I TOO HAD A CHILD
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.559
I ALSO GAVE HIM UP
FOR ADOPTION.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.269
- MOM, IS THAT TRUE?

19:05.352 --> 19:06.562
- IT WAS BEFORE
I MET YOUR FATHER.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.730
YEARS LATER
AFTER I FINISHED MED SCHOOL,

19:08.814 --> 19:10.357
I TRIED TO FIND THIS CHILD.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.025
I WAS TOLD HE WAS TAKEN
TO A SMALL VILLAGE

19:12.109 --> 19:13.110
CALLED CHIMURAWATI.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.405
- CHIMURAWATI?

19:20.492 --> 19:23.078
WELL, THAT IS THE NAME
OF MY VILLAGE.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.580
- THEN PERHAPS YOU MIGHT KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

19:24.663 --> 19:26.707
TO A SMALL CHILD WITH
A STRANGE BIRTHMARK

19:26.790 --> 19:27.833
ON HIS WRIST,

19:27.916 --> 19:29.877
A BIRTHMARK SHAPED LIKE
A HANDBAG.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.255
- [English accent]
HANDBAG?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.510
- A BIRTHMARK LIKE THIS?

19:38.594 --> 19:39.636
- MY BABY.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.096
- OH, MY MOTHER.

19:41.179 --> 19:44.391
- MY BROTHER?

19:44.474 --> 19:45.767
- MY HEAD IS STILL SPINNING

19:45.851 --> 19:47.561
FROM ALL THESE WILD GOINGS-ON,

19:47.644 --> 19:49.897
BUT I AM SO GLAD
TO FINALLY GET TO KNOW

19:49.980 --> 19:51.440
MY LONG LOST BOY.

19:51.523 --> 19:57.321
- WHAT A SHAME YOU'LL BE
SO BUSY REHEARSING.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.447
- YOU HAVE A POINT.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.533
THE PART OF LADY BRACKNELL
IS YOURS.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.577
I'LL BE TOO BUSY BONDING
WITH MY MANU.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.329
- AND NISHKA.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.455
- OH, WHO'S NISHKA?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.123
- MY WIFE.
- [gasps]

20:08.206 --> 20:10.459
YOU MEAN I HAVE
A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.585
- YES.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.045
BUT YOU MUST BE GENTLE
WITH HER.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.130
SHE'S TIMID
AND EASILY BULLIED.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.340
- OH.

20:16.423 --> 20:20.427
MANU, YOU FILL
MY HEART WITH JOY.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.971
OKAY, RAVI,
IF THIS MAN MAKES YOU HAPPY,

20:23.055 --> 20:24.348
MARRY HIM.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.599
- THANK YOU, MOM.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.184
I ONLY HOPE OUR WEDDING
IS AS NICE

20:27.267 --> 20:28.810
AS THE ONE HE PLANS FOR YOU.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.481
- BOTH WILL HAVE MANY GUESTS
WEARING ORANGE.
