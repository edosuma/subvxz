00:02.583 --> 00:03.666
I'm not going.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.541
What are you talking about?

00:05.541 --> 00:08.875
You can't stay, and I can't go.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.791
I'll be worried about you all the time.

00:10.791 --> 00:12.000
That's just love.

00:13.916 --> 00:16.166
- Six years.
- Six years?

00:16.166 --> 00:18.041
Welcome to Narkina Five.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.000
No one's getting out, are they?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.916
- Not now.
- <i>I need a loan.</i>

00:22.666 --> 00:25.958
- Davo Sculdun.
- <i>He's not a banker. He's a thug.</i>

00:26.750 --> 00:27.750
What will it cost?

00:28.208 --> 00:31.041
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.

00:31.416 --> 00:32.666
You can't be serious.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.875
Have you heard from Cinta?

00:34.541 --> 00:36.500
She's doing what she was told.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.083
Receiving messages
is just as dangerous as sending them.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.375
You should keep that in mind.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.291
Sir...

00:42.291 --> 00:43.916
We need to get out of here.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.958
Sir, we need to get out of here!

00:45.958 --> 00:47.416
You didn't question the mother?

00:47.416 --> 00:49.166
If nothing else, she's our bait.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.375
She's the reason Andor came back.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.791
Your breathing sounds weak.

00:53.791 --> 00:56.791
The doctor was here yesterday.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.541
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

01:02.666 --> 01:07.125
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.541
Attack!

01:11.625 --> 01:14.875
One way out! One way out!

01:14.875 --> 01:17.500
Whatever happens now, we made it!

01:18.541 --> 01:20.708
Anto Kreegyr. I want you to meet him.

01:20.708 --> 01:23.500
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.666
He'll need air support.

01:24.666 --> 01:26.791
- I work alone.
- That's what I'm trying to change.

01:26.791 --> 01:28.833
<i>Why are we here tonight, Lonni?</i>

01:28.833 --> 01:29.916
<i>Dedra Meero,</i>

01:29.916 --> 01:33.291
<i>she just captured a rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.</i>

01:33.291 --> 01:36.416
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.500
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.833
<i>And if he doesn't,
they'll know something's amiss.</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:44.625
They'll be slaughtered.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.583
I can't feel my hands.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.791
They're leaving.

02:58.791 --> 03:00.000
Stop sayin' that.

03:00.958 --> 03:02.166
They're leaving.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.916
I can't climb back up.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.500
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.625
My hands won't work.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.625
I said, "I hear you."

03:23.291 --> 03:24.500
Tell me they're leaving.

03:25.708 --> 03:28.375
They're leaving. They're leaving.

03:30.666 --> 03:32.000
<i>She looks so peaceful.</i>

03:32.000 --> 03:34.666
<i>Yeah.
Let's try and get some air in here.</i>

03:34.666 --> 03:37.291
<i>Oh, we're gonna have
to get rid of that bedding.</i>

03:37.291 --> 03:39.666
<i>- We'll save it for Cassian.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:39.666 --> 03:41.333
<i>She would have
wanted it that way.</i>

03:41.916 --> 03:43.083
<i>It's heartbreaking.</i>

03:44.625 --> 03:45.791
<i>What about the droid?</i>

03:57.000 --> 03:59.583
Maybe we can just
put that to the side there.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.500
Let me. Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.875
We're gonna take her out in a minute,
if you want to say goodbye.

04:12.166 --> 04:15.666
I'll have them clear the room
if you want to be alone.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.833
I d-d-don't want to be alone.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.416
I want M-M-Maarva.

04:24.541 --> 04:26.625
Um,
they're gonna want to clear that.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.791
Jezzi's gonna be here 'till I get back.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.666
I can g-g-go with you.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.875
Jez?

04:35.875 --> 04:37.291
Yeah? Right here.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.666
Bee's gonna help you get organized.

04:39.666 --> 04:41.333
There's a lot to be done.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.250
You said I could g-g-go with you.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.791
The Daughters of Ferrix require
your assistance

04:48.791 --> 04:51.750
in matters of grave importance.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.375
We need to pull together, Bee.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.583
All of us.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.541
There she goes.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.625
That's sad. Taking her away. Ugh.

05:57.750 --> 05:58.958
Looks like someone died.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.541
It happens.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.458
Someone you know?

06:04.083 --> 06:05.333
Just started last week.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.500
It looks like it's just these two.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.916
They didn't walk here.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.125
Better if we go around...

06:29.000 --> 06:30.041
Yeah.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.000
Hello.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.458
What is it?

06:45.458 --> 06:46.625
It's a quadjumper.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.291
Can you fly it?

06:49.291 --> 06:51.500
I don't know. It's an old one.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.000
Is that good?

06:55.875 --> 06:56.916
Do we have a choice?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.583
- Wait. Be careful.
- They can't see us.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.291
If they did,
they'd never get back in time.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.416
- What if someone's in there?
- We're getting out.

07:08.416 --> 07:09.875
- I know, I feel it.
- Wait.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.666
<i>This was last night?</i>

07:37.666 --> 07:39.208
They just moved the body.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.916
<i>- Tell me we are watching this carefully.</i>
- Full surveillance.

07:41.916 --> 07:43.416
What happens now?

07:43.416 --> 07:46.625
<i>As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.</i>

07:47.583 --> 07:49.208
<i>They'll want to close Rix Road.</i>

07:49.208 --> 07:50.416
<i>They'll ask for a permit.</i>

07:50.416 --> 07:52.958
<i>They know we won't allow it,
but they like to keep asking.</i>

07:52.958 --> 07:54.666
<i>They're building a list of grievances.</i>

07:55.208 --> 07:57.166
<i>We want a funeral.</i>

07:57.166 --> 07:58.416
Excuse me?

07:58.416 --> 08:00.166
You're going to give them a permit.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.375
Keep it small, limit the time,
limit the numbers.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.708
We want to put them in a box,
stand back and watch.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.083
As you wish.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.083
How much time do we have?

08:11.666 --> 08:14.041
<i>Two days. That's the Ferrix custom.</i>

08:14.875 --> 08:15.916
What's that?

08:16.666 --> 08:17.875
The dead are bricked.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.625
They mix your ashes
with mortar and local stone dust,

08:20.625 --> 08:22.333
put your name on and fire it up.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.000
You become a block of Ferrix brick.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.416
<i>And then what?</i>

08:26.708 --> 08:27.833
They find you a wall.

08:32.583 --> 08:35.541
Mysie my.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.666
Prison, <i>haye?</i> Escapers.

08:37.666 --> 08:38.958
Toosie-two.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.208
A thousand each the offer be.

08:41.208 --> 08:42.916
One for each of us, Freedi.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.541
Better fishing on land these times, <i>haye?</i>

08:48.625 --> 08:50.583
Killed our water then, <i>haye?</i>

08:50.583 --> 08:52.208
What?

08:52.208 --> 08:55.125
Not much squiggly now. Not much left.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.958
We meant you no harm.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.583
We killed nothing. Nothing.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.750
Prison done it. Spoilt our water.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.083
All our water.
<i>Haye,</i> Freedi?

09:04.291 --> 09:07.916
No biggy dinner tonight
like past times, Freedi?

09:09.083 --> 09:11.875
<i>Haye.</i> Water spoil here and far.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.833
- All your <i>scobbin</i> prison.
- That's the Empire.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.541
- We were trapped. We were trapped there.
- It's their prison.

09:17.541 --> 09:20.083
Ah, always the Empire, <i>haye?</i>

09:23.166 --> 09:24.708
What? What is he saying?

09:25.291 --> 09:26.500
What, what is he saying?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.125
He's saying, alive or dead,
the offer goes.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.000
- Toosie-two.
- Wait slow down, hey, hang on!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.833
No, no, no. Let's talk. Let's talk.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.750
- Hang on.
- Kill anyone they would.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.958
Kill the water. Kill the squigglies.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.708
Care not a <i>snod</i> who they kill, <i>haye?</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.125
Scob the Empire.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.708
They not be killing ye.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.833
<i>Naye</i> today.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.166
Wise to be jumping quickly, though.

09:54.833 --> 09:57.916
Where ye be looking to run now, eh?

10:03.125 --> 10:04.708
- Niamos?
- Oh.

10:04.708 --> 10:09.125
Niamos. <i>Haye.</i> Niamos.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.541
Oh, yeah.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.166
Can I help you?

11:17.166 --> 11:20.208
My cousin. I understand she shops here.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.458
Senator Mothma?

11:25.083 --> 11:26.083
Are we alone?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.958
You'd like to get something for her?

11:36.416 --> 11:37.666
We have some new pieces in.

11:37.666 --> 11:39.166
Where is he?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.833
She's been collecting jewelry.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.291
I don't have time for this.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.125
We have rules for a reason.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.125
You don't seem to understand that.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.833
I sent up a flag this morning.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.916
- We would have seen it tomorrow.
- We?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.625
The Fondor's gone.

11:59.666 --> 12:01.250
Checked the back on the way in.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.250
Everything you're doing
right now is wrong.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.250
Tomorrow is too late. Where is he?

12:08.833 --> 12:11.250
You're off the rails.
You're lucky he's not here.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.041
I gave him Aldhani.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.416
What have you done lately?

12:29.125 --> 12:30.250
I don't have lately.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.375
I have always.

12:32.875 --> 12:36.416
I have a constant blur of plates spinning
and knives on the floor,

12:36.416 --> 12:39.833
and needy, panicked faces at the window,
of which you are but one of many.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.083
What information?

12:51.875 --> 12:53.750
I'll make sure
he knows where it came from.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.416
Cassian Andor.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.500
The mother died.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.458
I'm leaving in the morning.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.375
Cinta says it's very busy there.

13:12.791 --> 13:13.791
I'll let him know.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.333
Do that.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.458
I am glad you're back.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.375
Big man's on site. I want full coverage.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.000
Spotters front and back.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.833
I want to know immediately
about any comings and goings,

14:09.833 --> 14:12.208
visitors, deliveries, anything.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.041
Bee, time to go.

14:36.583 --> 14:37.625
G-G-Go where?

14:38.375 --> 14:40.833
Back to my place.
I have work in the morning.

14:41.333 --> 14:44.125
- I'm charging.
- You've been there all day.

14:46.291 --> 14:48.958
I'll take the afternoon off.
We'll come back tomorrow.

14:51.708 --> 14:54.875
She's not here, Bee.
She's in the stone now.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.166
She's on her way.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.166
I can w-w-wait to make sure.

15:04.250 --> 15:07.291
I can't leave you here alone.
She wouldn't want that.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.708
You could stay.

15:18.666 --> 15:19.791
One night.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.375
<i>They make a sound as they die.</i>

15:36.375 --> 15:41.750
<i>A sort of choral, agonized pleading.</i>

15:42.583 --> 15:45.500
<i>If you're having difficulty speaking,
just shake your head.</i>

15:48.083 --> 15:49.125
<i>Doesn't take long.</i>

15:53.375 --> 15:55.000
<i>It won't feel that way to you.</i>

16:02.875 --> 16:06.000
Bix, care to join me?

16:33.750 --> 16:37.500
I'm going to ask you a question.
I expect an honest answer.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.000
If I'm not sure it's the truth,
I'll have to call back Dr. Gorst.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.208
Anto Kreegyr.

16:52.750 --> 16:57.708
That name, this face, have a good look.

17:06.166 --> 17:09.791
Is this the man
you introduced to Cassian Andor?

17:12.916 --> 17:13.916
Bix.

17:26.708 --> 17:31.125
<i>"Yielding in acceptance.
Safe in the braid of the old ways.</i>

17:32.958 --> 17:37.291
<i>"True and steady and braided in trust."</i>

17:37.291 --> 17:43.083
"The old ways hold us.
Safe in the knot, in the binding.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.166
"The old ways teach us.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.708
"Bound against the wind, tied to shore.

17:49.708 --> 17:52.541
-"Tethered in permanence..."
- Seriously? Is that really happening?

17:52.541 --> 17:54.625
- We did it.
- You did it.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.166
I thought this was over.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.416
It's back.
You're not following the trends.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.333
It's weird.
It's stronger here than it is at home.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.833
- But you, you can do what you want.
- It's not me.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.500
- Leida.
-"True and steady..."

18:06.500 --> 18:08.000
- Perrin?
-"...and braided in trust."

18:08.000 --> 18:10.666
No, no,
he's strangely open-minded on this topic.

18:10.666 --> 18:11.958
It's her, it's Leida.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.916
"...in the knot, in the binding."

18:13.916 --> 18:16.458
- Oh, no.
- She loves it.

18:17.375 --> 18:22.083
And her friends. It's the only thing
she shows up on time for, it's mad.

18:22.083 --> 18:25.916
"Yielding in acceptance.
Safe in the braid of the..."

18:25.916 --> 18:29.583
- I can't believe this.
- She found the elder.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.291
"...braided in trust.
The old ways hold us.

18:33.291 --> 18:36.208
"Safe in the knot, in the binding."

18:36.208 --> 18:38.250
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.041
"Bound against the wind...

18:41.041 --> 18:42.958
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.

18:42.958 --> 18:47.500
"...Tethered in permanence.
Yielding in acceptance."

18:49.375 --> 18:51.500
Last year,
I was pulling 100,000 credits

18:51.500 --> 18:54.291
every month from the family trust
without a trace.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.625
For Luthen?
I had no idea it was that much.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.208
It was so easy. I did it myself.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.333
Set up a stream of accounts.
It was like water running downhill.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.125
I'd empty the bottom,
and it would just flow. No one the wiser.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.458
A few months ago, I was contacted
by one of the bankers back home,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.583
I was warned that Imperial inspectors

19:16.583 --> 19:19.416
might be taking a close look
at Chandrilan accounts.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.625
He said they were contacting clients
to make sure everything was in order.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.250
I did what I could.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.250
I pulled everything I could access
up the hill into the main account.

19:32.291 --> 19:36.583
There was one empty ledger at the end
of the line that was off-balance.

19:38.458 --> 19:43.458
But it was so obscure
and I just didn't know what else to do.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.625
I was nervous.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.333
I went to Luthen. I told him
that I needed help from the outside,

19:48.333 --> 19:50.166
- that I knew the risk...
- Tay Kolma.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.333
- Yes.
- Hmm.

19:55.125 --> 19:56.125
And you trust him?

19:58.791 --> 19:59.875
Yes, I do.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.041
But then, Aldhani.

20:06.791 --> 20:08.625
Now, suddenly everything was frozen.

20:09.916 --> 20:14.416
I thought
Tay could help me replace the credits

20:14.416 --> 20:16.250
and get me started again,

20:16.250 --> 20:19.541
but what he really did was discover
just how much more trouble I was in.

20:25.958 --> 20:26.958
Here I am.

20:30.958 --> 20:32.041
How much is missing?

20:33.625 --> 20:34.958
Four hundred thousand.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.125
- And they're looking into this when?
- Soon. Very soon.

20:49.875 --> 20:50.958
Does Luthen know?

20:54.208 --> 20:57.333
Some? No. Not really.

21:01.208 --> 21:02.208
He warned me.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.791
Who knows what he knows.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.333
- This can't be exposed.
- I know that.

21:19.458 --> 21:20.791
I found a solution.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.708
Auntie Vel.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.333
- There you are.
- What are you doing here?

21:34.333 --> 21:36.291
Well, come back to see you.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.875
Hello. How have you been?

21:39.875 --> 21:43.458
- Good. I'm well. How are you?
- You are as nearly as tall as me.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.375
What were you doing in there?
Practicing the chant.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.791
Huh. How's that going?

21:54.041 --> 21:55.291
Call for you.

22:03.375 --> 22:06.500
<i>Sir? Is that you, sir?</i>

22:06.875 --> 22:08.833
Yes. Hello, Sergeant.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.166
<i>Apologies, sir. And to the family.</i>

22:11.625 --> 22:14.541
What? Good to see you.

22:14.541 --> 22:18.083
<i>Yes. Yes, I think so.
I'm on the night shift here.</i>

22:18.083 --> 22:20.625
<i>There's a line at the break
to use this thing.</i>

22:20.625 --> 22:24.125
<i>Brevity's encouraged,
so forgive me if I'm a bit hasty.</i>

22:24.125 --> 22:25.333
I can barely hear you.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.916
<i>Yes, Morlana One. Still here.</i>

22:27.916 --> 22:29.041
Just speak clearly.

22:29.041 --> 22:32.041
<i>Indeed. Been a bit rugged for me lately,</i>

22:32.041 --> 22:34.875
<i>but, you know, we're marching onward.</i>

22:37.166 --> 22:38.416
<i>It's a smelter.</i>

22:40.250 --> 22:42.458
<i>There we go. Refueling.</i>

22:42.458 --> 22:44.916
<i>Should give us a moment.</i>

22:44.916 --> 22:48.666
<i>Andor. I'm calling about Andor.
You wanted news if I had it.</i>

22:48.666 --> 22:49.916
Yes. Please, go on.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.166
<i>Still a few Pre-Mor
holdouts working in the office</i>

22:53.166 --> 22:55.500
<i>helping with the Imperial transition.</i>

22:55.500 --> 22:58.375
<i>My old partner
still working the HQ night desk.</i>

22:58.375 --> 23:01.458
<i>He found me this afternoon
and he told me that...</i>

23:03.541 --> 23:04.666
Has he been caught?

23:04.666 --> 23:07.416
<i>- The mother.</i>
- You were talking about Andor.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.625
<i>Yeah, she's passed away.</i>

23:10.625 --> 23:11.750
Andor's mother?

23:11.750 --> 23:14.583
<i>There's lots of back
and forth with Coruscant about it.</i>

23:14.583 --> 23:17.833
- So, are you saying that he's there?
- <i>No, no, I'm in Morlana.</i>

23:17.833 --> 23:19.083
Where is Andor?

23:19.083 --> 23:23.208
<i>Yes. Yes, that's it.
That he might show up at the funeral.</i>

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
When?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.541
<i>If he's not getting there, sir, has to...</i>

23:27.541 --> 23:30.291
<i>Factored... I wouldn't put it past him.
Not what we've been through.</i>

23:30.291 --> 23:32.500
We need to speak further.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.291
<i>I knew you'd want to...</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
The mystery of your former triumphs
have been vanquished.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.208
I can sleep peacefully now.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.041
(OVER SPEAKER) <i>Tyranny requi...</i>

25:00.625 --> 25:02.125
What's all this?

25:04.375 --> 25:05.416
Good to know.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.375
Put it down or give it back.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.708
I'm in. I'll do it.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.250
- Do what?
- Spellhaus power station.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.375
Tell Kreegyr I'm in.

25:32.083 --> 25:36.875
Tell him I'll bring air power,
but we take tactical orders from no one.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.375
You've taken a long time
coming back to me, Saw.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.750
We get to loot the eastern garrison.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.666
Whatever we can carry off.
And I want all the gear that you promised.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.666
You're too late. He's going tomorrow.

25:48.666 --> 25:50.500
We'll be ready. We have charts.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.333
All he has to do
is tell us when he wants it,

25:53.333 --> 25:57.333
and agree to my terms. Make it happen.

26:02.541 --> 26:03.666
I think not.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.416
Why?

26:08.875 --> 26:10.291
You were so eager for it.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.458
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.208
And how do we know this?

26:18.208 --> 26:19.458
I won't tell you that.

26:21.958 --> 26:24.375
And Kreegyr, he doesn't know.

26:29.458 --> 26:31.666
- How do you know I won't tell him?
- I don't.

26:31.666 --> 26:33.166
I don't know what you'll do.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.958
It's far from ideal for either of us.

26:43.708 --> 26:46.000
You're willing to burn him.

26:47.458 --> 26:48.875
You're the random factor.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.916
- It's 30 men.
- Plus Kreegyr.

26:51.916 --> 26:53.500
So, you know he's doomed.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.291
Which means either you're ISB

26:57.291 --> 27:00.541
or you have someone inside
that you are protecting.

27:00.541 --> 27:02.333
Or I'm just a very good listener.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.541
You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?

27:10.041 --> 27:11.916
I did. I'm not sure right now.

27:11.916 --> 27:14.791
What if it was me instead of Kreegyr?
What would you do?

27:14.791 --> 27:17.708
Kreegyr doesn't know me.
I'm not vulnerable if he's captured.

27:18.541 --> 27:20.166
- Surely you've met him.
- I've met him.

27:20.166 --> 27:22.750
I've been in a room with him,
but he doesn't know that.

27:22.750 --> 27:26.416
We send people. We drop supplies.
We have special radios. He can't hurt me.

27:26.416 --> 27:27.500
Like I can.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.500
It's your decision, Saw.

27:38.541 --> 27:39.750
It's your decision.

27:40.916 --> 27:41.916
But know the choice.

27:42.541 --> 27:44.750
Do we let Kreegyr
go down and play the long game,

27:44.750 --> 27:48.791
or do we warn him and throw away a source
that's taken years to cultivate?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.916
You have people everywhere, don't you?

27:53.916 --> 27:56.541
- You're avoiding the question.
- All of your sources...

27:56.541 --> 27:57.625
Try to concentrate.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.500
There's someone with Kreegyr?

28:02.291 --> 28:05.791
Someone at ISB?
Maybe there's someone here with me.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.833
- You're wasting time.
- Why wouldn't you?

28:08.833 --> 28:12.625
- You're avoiding the choice.
- Who is it? Who is it?

28:16.291 --> 28:17.291
It's Tubes.

28:19.916 --> 28:21.833
He's my man.
He tells me everything.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.416
- Tell him. He deserves to know.
- What is this?

28:27.416 --> 28:29.416
What kind of game is this?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.833
Oh.

28:35.791 --> 28:39.208
There's no way out alive.
Of that you must be sure.

28:39.833 --> 28:42.291
I'm doing this so you'll listen.
So, listen.

28:46.083 --> 28:49.208
Kreegyr goes down,
the ISB will feel invincible.

28:49.208 --> 28:52.500
They'll feel untouchable.
We'll have a clear field to play.

28:53.458 --> 28:56.541
The alternative...
Kreegyr pulls out, we wave him off.

28:57.416 --> 28:59.208
They'll know they'll have to wonder.

28:59.583 --> 29:03.833
They'll trust nothing.
Just like you're doing right now.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.833
If I were ISB, Saw,

29:08.833 --> 29:11.291
why wouldn't I just send you out there
with him?

29:20.333 --> 29:22.416
I didn't want you
to have to make this choice.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.500
Thirty men.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.208
Plus Kreegyr.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.541
For the greater good.

29:39.333 --> 29:40.500
Call it what you will.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.208
Let's call it war.

30:12.416 --> 30:13.708
<i>Safe unlocked.</i>

30:22.708 --> 30:23.791
<i>Safe locked.</i>

30:39.625 --> 30:40.791
<i>Where are you?</i>

30:41.333 --> 30:44.541
- He wanted to reopen the offer.
- <i>And did you close the sale?</i>

30:44.541 --> 30:50.041
I did. It was more expensive than I hoped,
but I wasn't in a position to bargain.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.583
So, you're coming home?

30:52.625 --> 30:53.625
<i>Depends.</i>

30:54.708 --> 30:56.916
I'm most curious about the other piece.

30:58.833 --> 31:00.041
You should come home.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.875
Is it no longer available?

31:03.375 --> 31:05.583
No, it's very much on the table.

31:06.125 --> 31:09.541
<i>The negotiations are ongoing
and our representatives are involved,</i>

31:09.541 --> 31:11.000
there's other buyers involved,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.500
your presence would complicate
the bidding at this point.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.125
We need that piece. We lose that
and we'll have to close shop.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.833
- There's nothing more you can do.
- That's never true.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.375
It's a crowded market.

31:21.375 --> 31:25.250
You need to think of the consequences
of losing that piece to another collector.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.291
I'm preparing for every outcome.

31:27.791 --> 31:30.125
<i>There's only...</i>

31:30.125 --> 31:32.958
Luthen? Luthen?

31:49.291 --> 31:52.291
<i>This is Segra-Milo Imperial patrol.</i>

31:52.291 --> 31:54.375
<i>Please identify yourself, Haulcraft.</i>

31:56.166 --> 31:59.458
I need an active transponder ID.
Preference, Alderaan.

31:59.458 --> 32:00.583
Working.

32:01.958 --> 32:03.958
Sorry, can you repeat back, please?

32:04.458 --> 32:09.000
This is an Imperial patrol.
Standby for transponder scan.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.125
ID found.

32:13.375 --> 32:16.875
Yes, this is Alderaan 12912505.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.000
Standby, Haulcraft. Run it.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.375
What's out there?

32:25.375 --> 32:29.125
Arrestor cruiser.
Cantwell-class. Three klicks and closing.

32:30.041 --> 32:32.041
<i>Is there something wrong, patrol?</i>

32:32.041 --> 32:34.708
There's been partisan activity
in the area.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.208
<i>This is a piracy zone.</i>

32:36.208 --> 32:39.083
Oh, thank you for the warning.
I'll be careful.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.875
You'll be standing by
is what you'll be doing.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.041
Power the tractor beam.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.250
- How long on the ID?
- In the queue, sir.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.625
Decoy burn. Port thruster four. Rev it.

32:57.416 --> 32:58.750
Portside thruster four.

33:02.541 --> 33:03.666
Alderaan Haulcraft,

33:03.666 --> 33:06.875
please disengage any propulsion units
and prepare for tractor beacon.

33:06.875 --> 33:08.458
Affirmative, patrol.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.791
<i>I have an engine overheating here,
so it may take a moment.</i>

33:14.208 --> 33:17.166
Countermeasures charging.

33:17.416 --> 33:18.666
Check his thermal.

33:18.666 --> 33:21.208
Aberrant heat signature.
Port-side thruster.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.916
- Get a boarding team ready.
- Prepped and ready, sir.

33:23.916 --> 33:29.375
Tractor beam has been engaged, Haulcraft.
Please, power down your stabilizers.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.583
Calibrate tractor force.

33:31.583 --> 33:32.708
Calibrating.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.333
Confirm request, Haulcraft.

33:40.416 --> 33:41.833
Tractor force two.

33:43.125 --> 33:47.541
Sorry, patrol. I'm a one man show here.
I have to manual these stabilizers.

33:48.750 --> 33:51.958
ID confirmed, sir.
Alderaan Trade Alliance.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.875
- Cancel the boarding?
- No.

33:55.541 --> 33:57.041
We can use the practice.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.083
Prepare for boarding
and inspection, Haulcraft.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.666
Engage reverse stabilizers on my throttle.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.750
Acknowledged.

34:10.791 --> 34:13.291
- What's he doing?
- Tractor force up five.

34:13.291 --> 34:15.541
Does he think he can get away?
Increasing five.

34:15.541 --> 34:18.541
Some pirate Haulcraft?
Where does he think he's gonna go?

34:19.416 --> 34:20.791
Final warning, Haulcraft.

34:20.791 --> 34:24.833
Power down immediately
or risk full consequences.

34:27.958 --> 34:30.041
Countermeasures armed.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.291
What is that?

34:43.916 --> 34:45.416
- No!
- From a Haulcraft?

34:45.916 --> 34:47.625
Tractor beacon is failing us.

34:47.625 --> 34:50.375
I can see that.
Where's my air wing?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.916
Tractor beacon is down.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.458
Hyperspace calibration complete.

36:02.583 --> 36:04.833
- Xanwan Freight.
- (OVER SPEAKER) <i>You busy?</i>

36:04.833 --> 36:06.791
Excuse me? Who is this?

36:07.208 --> 36:09.458
- <i>Are you alone?</i>
- I'm not getting picture.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.208
<i>I need to get a message
to Maarva Andor.</i>

36:13.500 --> 36:15.541
- Cassian?
- <i>Don't. No names.</i>

36:18.291 --> 36:19.375
Where are you?

36:19.375 --> 36:22.875
<i>Tell Maarva I'm okay.
Tell her I'm thinking about her.</i>

36:23.541 --> 36:24.833
<i>She'd be proud of me.</i>

36:24.833 --> 36:28.166
<i>And I'll get back as soon as I can.
Can you remember that?</i>

36:29.250 --> 36:31.083
- Cass, hang on.
- <i>No names!</i>

36:32.541 --> 36:35.750
<i>I'm counting on you, Xan.
Just let her know what I said.</i>

36:35.750 --> 36:36.833
Wait.

36:37.625 --> 36:38.666
<i>What?</i>

36:42.041 --> 36:43.208
Cass, I'm sorry.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.291
Your mother's dead.

37:28.125 --> 37:30.000
You got through? It's okay?

37:32.083 --> 37:34.541
Yeah. Everything okay.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.708
All this space.

37:41.291 --> 37:44.041
Fresh air. Like a dream, right?

37:46.166 --> 37:50.000
How many do you think made it?
How many of us made it out alive?

37:54.958 --> 37:56.000
Not enough.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.541
What if it's just us?

37:59.458 --> 38:00.875
What if we're the only ones?

38:02.416 --> 38:04.958
Somebody's got to tell people
what's happening back there.

38:07.416 --> 38:10.375
We need to split up. Double our chances.

38:11.291 --> 38:15.000
One of us has to make it.
People have to know what's going on.

38:18.583 --> 38:19.583
I know.

38:21.583 --> 38:22.625
Take this.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.583
People have to know about this.
