Yeah?

00:23.391 --> 00:25.993
Hey, it's Louie.
Yes, I know, stupid.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.997
It's 2017, everybody knows
who's calling everybody.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
Jesus Christ, just--

00:32.066 --> 00:35.069
Okay, fine, don't call
me then, bye.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.937
Well--

00:36.970 --> 00:38.206
Jesus.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.548
(In elderly voice)
Hello?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.083
Hey.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.085
Hello, who is this?

00:51.119 --> 00:52.286
Operator?

00:52.320 --> 00:53.587
(clearing throat)

00:53.621 --> 00:57.024
Is this a party
line, hello?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.559
Okay, are you
done now?

00:58.592 --> 01:02.196
Yes, Mary, go ahead and be
boring, I'm listening.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.397
Okay, look.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.632
I just--

01:05.999 --> 01:08.136
This is gonna suck,
I know it.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.972
Just... listen.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.041
I got-- My kids are
at their mom's now

01:14.074 --> 01:15.476
and they're gonna
be there tonight

01:15.509 --> 01:19.147
and I just thought...
that maybe we could--

01:19.180 --> 01:20.448
Maybe I could take you out.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.749
Take me out
of what?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.217
My comfort zone?

01:23.251 --> 01:24.718
No, on a date.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.554
Ugh, oh, my God.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.055
Look, don't
get all--

01:28.088 --> 01:31.492
Just because I let you
kiss part of my mouth...

01:31.525 --> 01:33.427
You kissed me back.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.763
I most certainly did not.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.134
Well, what about it?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.335
I'm busy.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.437
Doing what?

01:43.471 --> 01:46.140
Searching for baby elephants
up in your mother's vagina.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.775
What do you care?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.410
What is it with guys
that if they can

01:49.443 --> 01:50.444
prove you're not
doing anything,

01:50.478 --> 01:52.180
then you have
to blow 'em?

01:52.213 --> 01:56.083
I just wanna have
some fun... with you.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.418
I just wanna--
I just wanna go out

01:57.451 --> 01:59.287
and have
a good time.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.654
With you.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.491
Okay?

02:04.825 --> 02:06.460
Okay.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.661
Yes, we can.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.297
If you want.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.465
Hang out tonight.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.633
On a date.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.302
I d--
Bye!

02:15.836 --> 02:18.439
Jive ass turkey.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.673

02:21.509 --> 02:25.313
**

02:56.377 --> 02:58.312
Hey.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.314
(laughing)

03:00.348 --> 03:01.782
What?

03:09.357 --> 03:11.759
Hey, you wanna
try that on?
No!

03:11.792 --> 03:14.562
Oh, okay.
Sorry.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.266
Thank you very much.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.269
The-- no-- umph.
Hey, you
give a tip.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.637
Well.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.841
(Pamela laughing)

03:27.875 --> 03:30.411
Uhn, ew.
What--

03:30.444 --> 03:32.746
no, that's--
Look, that's art.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.348
(laughing)
That's like--

03:34.382 --> 03:36.884
It's an artistic
piece of art.
Ugh.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.454
Look, it's called
"Bag of Shit."

03:40.488 --> 03:43.223
Jesus.
Hm.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.759
I love these, I mean--
These are
kind of cool.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.261
Yeah, I wouldn't
mind having

03:47.295 --> 03:48.629
one of these
in my house.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.731
Many nooses of neon.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.300
I mean, what
even is neon?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.601
It looks like liquid.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.337
What it is, it's
an inert gas that--

03:57.738 --> 04:00.508
Don't try.
gets excited
by high voltage.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
Wow.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.581
That--
It's the shitter.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.583
Don't touch it,
don't touch it.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.585
His shit's over there,
that's brilliant!
Don't put your--

04:11.619 --> 04:12.920
Pointing.
Don't point at it.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.756
That's so
brilliant, mmm.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.591
My God.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.825
Did you see the--

04:52.993 --> 04:54.795
(laughing)

04:54.828 --> 04:56.830
It's so
weird, look.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.265
They're dirty.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.502
It's so nasty!
They're dirty.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.303
He just
left the--

05:06.707 --> 05:07.975
That's--

05:18.318 --> 05:20.388
This piece is
called "Diarrhea."

05:20.421 --> 05:21.889
That's called "Diarrhea"?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.424
This is "Diarrhea."

05:25.659 --> 05:28.429
It's very
beautiful, "Diarrhea."

05:30.864 --> 05:32.332
What is that?

05:33.601 --> 05:34.835
(Pamela laughing)

05:38.839 --> 05:40.007
It's called "Jews."

05:40.040 --> 05:41.509
Shut up.
Look.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.712
What is this
now, nothing?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.814
Nice nothing.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.550
That's something.
It says
something there.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.751
That's something.
Um...

05:50.784 --> 05:52.753
There's this
thing on this--

05:53.954 --> 05:55.355
Hm.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.826
I guess you're
supposed to...

05:58.859 --> 06:01.061
I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.764
Why, it says "press."

06:03.797 --> 06:06.734
So you press a thing
because it says "press"?

06:06.767 --> 06:09.437
You would not have
survived the camps.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.072
Whack-- why-- it's...

06:12.105 --> 06:13.874
It says "press."
Dude... go ahead.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.075
Why would they make
it say "press"--

06:15.108 --> 06:17.310
Press the art
button, enjoy.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.614
(man's voice)
Nigger.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.450
Whoa.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.385
No, no, I didn't
say it.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.587
I didn't say it,
it's the butt--

06:26.620 --> 06:27.788
Listen.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.056
(mooing)

06:29.089 --> 06:31.058
Okay, no, no, no, no,
wait a second.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.460
(screaming)

06:32.493 --> 06:33.961
No, wait...

06:33.994 --> 06:35.796
(meowing)
Okay.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.731
(barking)

06:45.639 --> 06:47.107
Yeah.
Is there any more?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.777
I think that's the end
of the rainbow...

06:49.810 --> 06:51.879
the art rainbow.
No more--

06:51.912 --> 06:53.614
Oh, there's
one more.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.617
Oh... Jesus.
What to do?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.418
That's uh, artistic...

06:58.452 --> 06:59.620
Okay, then.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.622
All right, that's...

07:01.655 --> 07:04.424
Very well done thing.
There's...

07:04.458 --> 07:05.693
people.
(gasping)

07:11.765 --> 07:13.634
(Pamela gasping)

07:13.667 --> 07:17.505
**

07:19.006 --> 07:20.774

07:39.727 --> 07:40.928
I'm hungry now.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.663
You wanna...
Yep.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.164
Come on,
let's go eat.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.138
(laughing)

07:51.171 --> 07:52.973
Don't even--
Ooh, Chinese.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.509
That's imaginative,
isn't it?
Yeah, yeah.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.545
Isn't this a good idea?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.146
Hi! Hi,
how are you?
Hi.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.781
Nice to see you.
Yeah, nice see you.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
Hi, I-- Do you have
the thing I left?

08:02.850 --> 08:04.652
Before, remember,
I left something here?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.820
Yeah, I remember, I remember,
I hide it very good.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.955
Oh, thank you
very much.
Yeah, yeah,

08:07.988 --> 08:09.523
Thank you.
yeah.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.824
No one touch
it, okay?
No--

08:10.858 --> 08:12.459
Thank you, and we're
gonna order

08:12.492 --> 08:13.661
to go, okay,
thank you very much.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.495
We are,
go where?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.998
Just look at the menu
and pick a food.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.199
What are you doing?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.001
What are you doing?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.803
Oh.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.839
So "Little Miss" that has
an idea about something.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.175
She's a little
mysterious, hmm?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.010
It's very mysterious.
Uh-huh.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.645
Hi, don't worry, okay?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.481
A lot of good
things there.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.849
Thank you, thank you.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.486
**

08:39.519 --> 08:40.921
It's when they're coming
and they go...

08:40.954 --> 08:42.990
(mumbling song lyrics)

08:43.023 --> 08:46.226
And then they go...
* and, and...
* And...

08:46.259 --> 08:48.028
* Shit

08:48.061 --> 08:50.230

Wait, Louie?
What?

08:58.105 --> 09:01.008
No, no one goes into
Central Park at night.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.109
It's--

09:02.142 --> 09:03.777
We're doing it.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.945
Yeah?
Yes.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.714
We're--
Fine.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.049

it's fine... **

09:09.082 --> 09:12.886

09:18.926 --> 09:20.127
(Louie)
Like this--

09:20.160 --> 09:21.561
(both)
and Jews.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.264
Why Jews?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.633
I don't know,
you said it, too.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.635
I know.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.772
Okay, come here.
Come where?

09:31.805 --> 09:32.940
This is the right--

09:32.973 --> 09:34.608
The perfect place.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.644
And we're doing this now.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.246
What is that--
is that a blanket?
Yeah.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.282
What do you experience
happening... here?

09:42.315 --> 09:43.751
It's already happening.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.619
Oh.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.820
'Kay.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.288
Okay.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.123
All right,
come on, sit down.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.959
'Kay.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.295
I'm starving.
Me too.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.964
Ooh.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.598
It's freezing,
but I don't care.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.833
Me too.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.608
I love this.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.177
Me too.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.182
I love to eat
horse penises on Broadway.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.784
Me too!

10:18.551 --> 10:19.987
(both laughing)

10:22.656 --> 10:24.157
Okay, all right.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.295
Now, this is it,
give me this.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.933
Okay, now.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.634
Lie down on your back.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.137
Is this your move?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.872
Jesus, oh man.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.107
Just-- come on,
lie down.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.709
I'm doing it, look.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.311
Just on your back,
like this, next to me.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.746
Just trust me.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.016
Hey!

10:49.049 --> 10:50.250
Come over.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.124
Okay, now.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.358
You ready?

11:00.761 --> 11:01.962
Louie...
Just--

11:01.995 --> 11:03.864
This is dumb
and weird.
Just go with it.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.365
What?
Please, just go
with it.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.800
Okay?

11:06.834 --> 11:07.968
Can you do that,
just trust

11:08.001 --> 11:09.870
me and go
with this?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.739
All right, now look up.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.807
Look straight up.
Okay.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.208
Look straight up.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.810
Don't look left,
don't look right.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.746
No.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.314
You-- As you look straight
up at the sky,

11:21.348 --> 11:26.319
your eyes will start tuning
out... all the city lights

11:26.353 --> 11:29.056
and you just start
seeing stars.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
You see?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.025
Yeah.
See how they pop up?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.326
You starting to see 'em?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.728
Yeah.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.864
Okay, just keep
looking up.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.906
Louie.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.407
I feel like this--

11:47.440 --> 11:49.777
(gasping)
Oh, my God!

11:49.810 --> 11:51.378
I just saw
a shooting star.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.780
Uh-huh.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.281
You saw it?
Look, keep looking up,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.216
keep looking up,
keep looking up.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.219
Louie!

11:59.252 --> 12:00.420
Oh, my God!

12:00.453 --> 12:01.789
Mm-hmm.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.056
There was
another one!

12:03.090 --> 12:04.257
Uh-huh.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.760
Oh, my God!

12:06.794 --> 12:07.961
Louie!

12:07.995 --> 12:10.230
Uh-huh.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.965
What did you do?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.133
It's a meteor shower.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.769
It happens
every 17 years.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.005
**

12:21.174 --> 12:22.709
You knew?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.144
Mm-hmm.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.818
Uh-oh.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.285
What?

12:35.255 --> 12:38.425
This is...

12:38.458 --> 12:40.727
Good move.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.962
Yeah?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.833
Yeah.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.335
Good move.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.175
(whispering)
Oh, shit.

12:55.208 --> 12:59.012
**

13:24.004 --> 13:25.472
Oh, no, no, no,
stop it, now.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.040
Stop it.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.877
You gave me the stars,
let me look at them.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.145
Okay, okay, okay.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.814
All right.

13:34.848 --> 13:35.983
Look.
Wow!

13:36.016 --> 13:37.484
(laughing)

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
Uh.
(clearing throat)

13:41.188 --> 13:43.023
Stupid.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.097
No.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.908
Look.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.818
Wow.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.521
Yeah.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.356
Your head
is so bald.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.168
(door opening)

14:28.201 --> 14:29.436
Okay, I'm just gonna
use your toilet,

14:29.469 --> 14:30.870
and then I gotta go.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.978
(door closing)

14:51.824 --> 14:54.127
Okay.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.595
Bye, thank you.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.030
That was actually
really nice.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.231
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

14:58.265 --> 15:00.067
Hey!
Oh, shit.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.969
Wait.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.137
You're gonna want to
do things.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.306
Well, yeah,
come on.
You know what, Louie?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.041
You just can't
make people do things.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.442
I'm not making
you do anything.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.211
This is--

15:11.244 --> 15:13.947
We're having a romantic time
and you know it, come on.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.949
No, we're friends,
it's just like if

15:15.983 --> 15:18.085
we were girls
or frogs or whatever.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.552
No.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.456
Frogs don't... kiss in
the park under the stars.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.025
Yes, they do.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
Okay, just go.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.532
Go ahead and go.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.139
Ugh.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.285
What are you doing?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.354
What do you care?

15:54.387 --> 15:56.456
Oh, this is serious.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.126
This is serious?

16:00.327 --> 16:01.995
This is serious.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.431
You know what,
if you

16:04.464 --> 16:06.133
don't care,
I don't care.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.673
I feel like you--

16:13.706 --> 16:16.476
You like me and you want
to get close to me

16:16.509 --> 16:19.679
and then I do it and
then you shove me away.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.650
And frankly, that hurts.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.185
And I don't--

16:25.218 --> 16:26.686
I mean, either you don't--

16:26.719 --> 16:29.989
Either you want to hurt me
or you don't care,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.559
but either one is a person that
I don't want to be with.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.528
So just go.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.966
Hey.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.434
I don't like that.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.673
You really want
me to go?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.712
What-- What if...

16:52.745 --> 16:55.148
What?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.716
Nothing, forget it.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.385
Fine.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.626
What if I let you
see my underwear?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.602
Wanna see?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.036
Yeah.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.940
Okay.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.675
Wait there,
don't look.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.077
Well, how am
I supposed to--

17:24.111 --> 17:25.312
Shut up.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.657
(camera phone shutter clicking)

17:47.434 --> 17:49.569
Okay.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.271
Can I stay now?
Yeah.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.175
Now you show me.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.647
No, do like I did.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.152
Okay.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.190
(camera phone shutter clicking)

18:15.662 --> 18:17.297
(camera phone beeping)

18:23.102 --> 18:25.638
Okay.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.073
Let's do more.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.641
Okay.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.116
(camera phone shutter clicking)

18:37.150 --> 18:38.851
(camera phone beeping)

18:46.526 --> 18:48.127
Now you
show me more.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.638
(camera phone shutter
clicking then beeping)

19:06.546 --> 19:08.848
Okay, then.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.550
You wanna
really see?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.652
Yeah.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.521
Yeah, I'm sure
you do, stupid.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.768
(knocking)

19:31.704 --> 19:33.373
(doorbell ringing)

19:35.408 --> 19:36.609
(doorbell ringing)

19:42.282 --> 19:43.483
(knocking)

19:43.516 --> 19:45.452
(doorbell ringing)

19:49.889 --> 19:51.591
(knocking)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.660
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.395
Yup, Yup--

19:56.596 --> 19:58.197
(knocking)
Yup.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.199
Coming.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.504
There he is.
(Lilly and Jane)
Guess what!

20:04.537 --> 20:05.672
It's snowing!
It's so
beautiful outside.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.274
It's snowing,
and it's like...

20:07.307 --> 20:09.409
No, yeah, I saw
out the window.
a live snow globe.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.610
Bye.
It's so beautiful, it's
like a living snow globe.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.778
Hi.
It's so pretty.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.212
Hello.
So-- so pretty.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.447
(Jane)
Bye, Mommy.
Hey.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.115
Hey, I didn't--

20:16.148 --> 20:18.785
Remember, we switched
to the morning for today?

20:18.818 --> 20:20.219
Yeah, right.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.354
You're okay, right?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.922
Yeah, I'm okay.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.391
You doing all right,
you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.758
Okay, well,
see you later.
All right.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.226
(man)
Hey, can I use
your bathroom?

20:30.497 --> 20:32.532
(Jane)
Lilly, come look!

20:32.565 --> 20:33.900
Oh, shit.
(Lilly)
Yeah?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.302
What is it?

20:35.335 --> 20:36.969
(whispering)
Oh, boy.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.408
(Lilly)
Whoa, hello.
(Pamela) Hi.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.943
So did you
sleep over?

20:43.976 --> 20:45.312
What?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.714
Well, obviously
she slept over.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.382
You're Daddy's
girlfriend now.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.583
What?

20:50.617 --> 20:52.285
No, blech!

20:52.319 --> 20:53.453
Hey, that's
my daddy.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.787
What do you
mean "blech"?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.222
(Pamela)
I mean blech,
look at him.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.424
Come here.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.158
Come here.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.428
Girls, look at him.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.496
He's a monster.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.465
I mean, who
looks like that?

21:05.498 --> 21:06.899
That's supposed to
be my boyfriend?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.969
I deserve better
than that.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.904
Look at his body.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.474
He's like a mailbox

21:14.507 --> 21:16.275
on two tree stumps

21:16.309 --> 21:17.544
with a melon on top.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.947
And look at his ass.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.815
Daddy, turn around.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.250
Turn around.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.486
Come on, Daddy.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.987
Lift up your shirt.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.290
He has zero ass.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.627
I mean, he has legs
and then a back.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.862
I mean,
I'm supposed to

21:35.895 --> 21:38.498
have a boyfriend
with no ass?

21:38.531 --> 21:39.699
Well, it's true,
my daddy

21:39.732 --> 21:40.933
poops out
of his back.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.469
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.303
It's true.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.506
Um, are you
guys hungry?

21:46.539 --> 21:47.974
Yes.
No.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.642
Good, let's
go to the kitchen,

21:49.676 --> 21:50.810
you can make me
some eggs,

21:50.843 --> 21:52.379
'cause I'm starving.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.681
(yawning)

21:56.483 --> 21:59.652
(Pamela)
Oh, it's snowing!

21:59.686 --> 22:01.821
Isn't it fun.

22:01.854 --> 22:05.558
**

22:23.843 --> 22:25.044
(metal clanging)

22:26.413 --> 22:27.614
(record skipping)

22:32.452 --> 22:33.753
**
