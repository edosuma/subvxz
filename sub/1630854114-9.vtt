WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:07.141
Ugh, there's still no news.
Me neither.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.009
I searched
"Detroit nurses strike"

00:09.110 --> 00:10.678
and got a bowling league.

00:10.778 --> 00:11.579
(scoffs)

00:11.679 --> 00:12.913
If we go on strike,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.748
they're going to
bring in temporary nurses.

00:14.848 --> 00:19.287
When my patients wake up,
they need to see this face.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.289
I love waking up to that face.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.923
Don't be sweet, I'm in crisis.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.759
Don't worry,
they'll settle.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.628
It's all about
who blinks first.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.098
Why can't they just give us
the staff we need

00:30.198 --> 00:32.833
so that people are not
overworked and underpaid?

00:32.933 --> 00:35.002
Well,
from a management perspective,

00:35.103 --> 00:36.003
a lot of the time,

00:36.104 --> 00:37.371
those margins are--

00:37.471 --> 00:39.307
You don't want
a management perspective.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.775
(phone chimes)

00:41.875 --> 00:42.710
Wow.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.011
Is that about the strike?

00:44.112 --> 00:46.614
No, it's a roofing estimate
for the factory.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.781
Wow.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.683
Is that a good wow
or a bad wow?

00:49.783 --> 00:52.253
It's good for the roofer.
(groans)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.355
Everything is going wrong.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.691
I told you,
you do not pray enough.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.327
(scoffs)

00:59.427 --> 01:01.462
You know what?
It can't hurt.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.231
He, God, it's me Bob.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.099
Please keep Abishola from
going on strike.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.534
And if you could,
send me a roofer

01:06.634 --> 01:08.502
that doesn't work for Satan.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.003
How'd I do?

01:10.738 --> 01:13.040
(phone chimes)

01:13.741 --> 01:16.910
Oh, no. Gloria said they are
walking away from the table.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.113
So it's happening.
It is happening.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.681
I'm sorry, honey.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.783
Well, where are you going?
The strike starts at midnight.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.619
If I go in now, I can check
on my patients one more time.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.688
You're kidding, right?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.223
They are my patients, Bob.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.925
They need to see this face.

01:33.427 --> 01:37.465
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

01:57.685 --> 01:59.453
(indistinct chatter)

01:59.553 --> 02:01.389
What do we want?
OTHERS: Change!

02:01.489 --> 02:02.756
Change.
When do we want it?

02:02.856 --> 02:03.757
OTHERS:
Now!

02:03.857 --> 02:04.758
Now.

02:04.858 --> 02:05.859
What do we want?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.127
OTHERS: Change!
Change.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.263
Excuse me, lazy people.
Excuse me.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.465
Working person
coming through.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.468
Hello, striking nurses.
How's your vacation going?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.970
It's not fair that
you get to do your job.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.306
Then come inside.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.774
I can sneak you in
through the morgue.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.511
Uh-uh. Crossing a picket line
is a union violation.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.579
It would be
if Abishola did it,

02:25.679 --> 02:28.416
but what if
Cindy the travel nurse did?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.618
I have an extra wig in my bag.

02:30.718 --> 02:35.789
Hello, y'all, I am Cindy
from a town in Texas.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.425
You may not like it,

02:37.525 --> 02:39.260
but this is
how we get things done.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.629
You know, we wouldn't even
have lunch breaks

02:41.729 --> 02:43.897
if it weren't
for our strike in '96.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.599
How long did you strike
for lunch?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.635
A month.
A month?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.603
Change doesn't happen overnight.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.040
I cannot listen to your
amplified voice for that long.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.842
Sorry, but we're doing

02:54.942 --> 02:56.176
something important here.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.645
ABISHOLA:
What if they never give in?

02:57.745 --> 03:00.948
What if they replace us
with temporary nurses?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.483
What if I cannot find a new job

03:02.583 --> 03:05.118
and end up with Kemi
in food services?
Uh-uh.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.854
Be angry at management,
not me.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.057
You cannot tell me what to do,
you are not my boss yet.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.126
This is why we do not see
idle Nigerians.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.328
They go crazy.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.397
Look at her, cuckoo bird.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.599
Give me one of these.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.334
It will make it easier
to get through. Excuse me.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.003
Yes, yes, change. Yes. Yes.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.473
Change, change, yes.
Bye. Yes, change.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.608
Look, if you can't

03:27.708 --> 03:29.042
handle this emotionally,

03:29.142 --> 03:30.878
you can just stay at home,
we'll be fine.

03:30.978 --> 03:31.979
No, no, no, no, no.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.547
I'm okay. I'm okay.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.648
Good. Good.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.016
All right, party people.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.851
What do we want?
OTHERS: Change!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.019
Our jobs back.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.321
When do we want it?
OTHERS: Now!

03:40.421 --> 03:41.622
As fast as possible.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
GLORIA: What do we want?
OTHERS: Change!

03:48.762 --> 03:50.331
Morning.
Hello, Bob.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.633
Morning, Uncle Tunde. Auntie.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.303
It's very interesting
to see a boss

03:55.403 --> 03:56.970
willing to get
his hands dirty.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.339
UNCLE TUNDE:
In Nigeria,

03:58.439 --> 03:59.940
a superior would
never debase himself

04:00.040 --> 04:01.909
in front of
one of his employees.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.544
Much less
his employee's wife.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.213
Okay, thanks for stopping by,
Auntie.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.048
Work hard, husband.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.383
(sighs)

04:09.483 --> 04:11.051
I packed a surprise
in your lunch.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.686
Oh, thank you. (chuckles)

04:12.786 --> 04:13.887
What could it be?

04:13.987 --> 04:16.324
It is a Twinkie.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.601
That drain needs
to work properly.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.269
I agree.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.238
You will want to hose this
floor off from time to time,

04:31.339 --> 04:33.073
and, well, you cannot do it
if it's clogged.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.842
Same page, Tunde!

04:36.043 --> 04:37.210
(groans)
Oh, yeah.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.112
This is where the smell's
coming from.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.681
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.784
Uh, where is the man who
throws money at every problem?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.587
He died
when I bought this factory.

04:47.488 --> 04:51.325
I will miss my valet parking,
same-day-shipping friend.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.226
Do me a favor,
don't tell Abishola.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.695
I don't want her to worry.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.030
About the fact that
you are hemorrhaging money

04:57.130 --> 04:58.532
at an unsustainable rate?

04:59.533 --> 05:00.801
Yep.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.135
And with every passing day,

05:02.235 --> 05:03.471
the idea of this
becoming profitable

05:03.571 --> 05:06.173
becomes more and more remote?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.842
That's right.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.078
And it would only confirm
Abishola's initial fear

05:11.178 --> 05:12.713
that this entire venture
is a mistake?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.448
Same page, Tunde!

05:18.352 --> 05:20.754
E kaasan, Mummy.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.756
How was your striking?

05:22.856 --> 05:25.593
Did you complain enough
to get what you want?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
I hated it.
I kept wishing

05:27.861 --> 05:29.329
someone on the bus
would have a heart attack

05:29.430 --> 05:30.831
so I could do my job.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.233
Mm. I raised you well.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.768
I have nothing to do.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.136
Maybe cleaning the house
will cheer me up.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.137
You cannot do that.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.372
Why not?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.640
I have already
cleaned the house.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.410
That is why
I am in such a good mood.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.545
Even behind the refrigerator?

05:44.645 --> 05:47.548
Uh-uh. Who do you think
you are talking to?

05:47.648 --> 05:49.683
Behind, on top,

05:49.783 --> 05:50.984
inside.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
You can see yourself
in the crisper bins.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.288
Okay, I'll go outside
and rake some leaves.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.057
Dele already did.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.226
Dele!

05:59.326 --> 06:00.428
Yes, Mum?

06:00.528 --> 06:01.695
Did you rake the leaves?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.263
I sure did, Mum.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.234
Thank you.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.602
You're welcome.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.837
You want me
to take out the trash, too?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.539
Don't you dare.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.776
BOB: All right,
you want to play rough?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.578
We can play rough.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.813
I got a whole list
of other things to do today,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.515
you selfish bastard!

06:21.615 --> 06:22.616
Bob?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.017
Oh, hey.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.920
Are you talking to
a hole in the floor?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.355
Little bit.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.790
What are you doing here?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.192
Ugh. I've spent
the whole morning telling people

06:32.292 --> 06:34.161
what I want and when I want it.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.363
I'm ready to do some real work.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.832
Well, I wish
I had something for you.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.301
Everything's going great here.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.805
So, you are snaking this drain
for no reason?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.540
Well, that's routine
maintenance.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.476
Old buildings,
like old people,

06:48.576 --> 06:51.011
need their pipes cleaned out
every now and then.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.180
I did not see the roofers
outside.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.414
I thought
they were starting today.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.683
Uh, they had to reschedule.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.250
Again,
completely normal.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.053
Roofers are notoriously flaky.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.722
I have never heard that.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.258
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you this,
I would never date a roofer.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.227
What is going on?

07:07.327 --> 07:09.630
Why are you making
terrible jokes?

07:09.730 --> 07:10.931
I'm not.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.434
Maybe the roofing joke was
"over your head."

07:15.168 --> 07:16.870
Come on, nothing?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.973
I was wrong about
Olu's lunch surprise.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.842
It was an apple.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.445
Tunde! I found us
an extra set of hands.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.847
Why don't you two

07:26.947 --> 07:28.248
go set up my office?

07:28.348 --> 07:29.917
You are trying to get rid of me.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.586
Nonsense, I'm giving you
a chance to soak in the wisdom

07:32.686 --> 07:34.421
of our senior consultant.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.389
That is me.
Yeah.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.358
You guys have fun.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.662
Remember,
every day is a precious gift.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.197
(chuckles forcefully)
All right. Okay.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.999
Oh, God, I'm screwed.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.447
Hello.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.450
Hello, temporary nurse.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.419
(sighs):
Okay.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.925
Can I help you?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.594
Yes, you can.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.129
Go downstairs,
get in your car

08:16.229 --> 08:18.331
and never come back.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.534
You're friends with the nurses.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.435
That's got to be hard.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.471
Yes.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.939
But don't get too comfortable.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.407
They are coming back soon.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.709
I hope so, hon.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.444
You don't need to hope so,
I know so.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.480
These things can take a while.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.682
Last one I got called in on,

08:34.782 --> 08:37.585
the hospital ended up closing.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.688
I heard it's a Target now.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.691
So, you've done this
at other hospitals?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.158
Oh, yeah.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.526
I've seen them screw nurses

08:46.627 --> 08:48.461
from Portland to Poughkeepsie.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.864
And when you come in
and take their chairs,

08:50.964 --> 08:53.667
you are an accessory
to the screwing.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.303
Well, honestly,
I do feel a little guilty.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.238
I mean, on the one hand,

08:58.338 --> 08:59.973
I'm hurting my fellow nurses.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.009
But someone's got to be
here for the patients.

09:02.109 --> 09:06.346
It's not their fault
that management is a bunch of...

09:06.446 --> 09:08.515
horses' rear ends.

09:08.616 --> 09:12.019
Ugh. You make a good point.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.086
Thank you.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.287
Don't thank me.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.723
I came here to hate you,

09:15.823 --> 09:18.525
but your big kind eyes
are making it impossible.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.261
Have a good day!

09:21.361 --> 09:22.495
And I like your necklace!

09:22.596 --> 09:24.097
Aw, thanks, hon.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.467
Your sweetness is infuriating!

09:32.572 --> 09:35.542
Uncle,
does Bob seem okay to you?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.044
He is fine.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.480
He will even be more fine
when we set up his office.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.750
Grab the other end there,
please.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.418
Every time I ask him how
he's doing, he says great,

09:45.518 --> 09:48.689
then smiles in a way
that frightens me.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.858
Well, if he says
he's doing great,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.860
he must be great.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.496
Eh, the other wall.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.968
If you know anything,
please tell me.

10:01.769 --> 10:06.339
I know that
you are my favorite niece.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.243
Uncle,
you are avoiding my questions.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.045
That is true.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.714
You're a smart girl.

10:14.414 --> 10:18.551
Now, let's think about if Bob
would like a couch in here.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.120
(door opens)

10:20.220 --> 10:21.789
Hey, guys.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.291
Tunde,
do you happen to know

10:24.391 --> 10:27.227
where the water shutoff is?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.531
Outside,
the southeast corner.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.501
Thank you.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.110
He's doing great!

10:51.118 --> 10:53.486
You should've told me
things were this bad.

10:53.586 --> 10:54.822
I didn't want to worry you.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.089
Of course I'm worried.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.158
I feel like I'm standing
in Lake Michigan.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.394
Come on, this water's
much cleaner than Lake Michigan.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.763
This is not funny, Bob.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.698
Relax, it's gonna work out.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.866
Well, you do not know that.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.434
You're right, I don't.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.536
But it would be nice if I wasn't
the only one saying it.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.071
Where are you going?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.540
To the hardware store.
There's a cashier there

11:13.640 --> 11:14.708
who believes in me.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.076
He doesn't ask why I'm wet.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.045
He asks, "How can I help?"

11:18.145 --> 11:19.813
And it feels good!

11:24.952 --> 11:27.054
He's doing great!

11:31.491 --> 11:33.393
I know it's cold, guys,
but we're doing good.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.162
Hang in there.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.430
Have you heard anything
about the negotiations?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.833
You mean in the five minutes
since you asked the last time?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.701
No. Management
still hasn't budged

11:41.802 --> 11:42.836
on any of our demands.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.237
Maybe we should just accept

11:44.337 --> 11:46.239
what they're offering
and go back to work.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.176
(scoffs)
You want to fold already?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.845
(groans) Some money's better
than no money.

11:51.945 --> 11:52.980
But that's what they want,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.514
for us to set down our signs

11:54.614 --> 11:57.017
and be thankful for
whatever scraps they dole out.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.152
This is not a good time for me.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.321
Maybe we could delay the strike
for a year.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.691
Honey,
nothing worth getting is easy.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.626
And you are not a quitter.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.762
No, I am not.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.830
There you go.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.664
When we stick together,

12:11.765 --> 12:12.699
we can't be silenced!

12:12.800 --> 12:14.001
OTHERS:
Yeah!

12:14.101 --> 12:16.069
They think
they can outlast us?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.805
OTHERS: No!
Every day,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.606
we are underestimated.
OTHERS: Yeah!

12:19.706 --> 12:21.041
Unappreciated.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.475
OTHERS: Yeah!
Drooled on,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.112
pooped on,
and still, we come in here

12:25.212 --> 12:27.747
for our 12-hour shifts
and save lives.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.917
OTHERS: Yeah!
Because we're nurses,

12:30.017 --> 12:32.019
and nobody's stronger than us!

12:32.119 --> 12:34.087
OTHERS:
Yeah!

12:34.855 --> 12:36.957
That was amazing.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.491
Not all heroes wear capes.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.161
Some of them are covered
in bodily fluids.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.696
What are you doing here?

12:43.797 --> 12:46.333
I wanted to see my friends.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.235
Well, that's sweet.
Yes.

12:48.335 --> 12:52.372
Work is not the same without
your sassy, old lady wit.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.606
And Abishola's...

12:53.706 --> 12:55.809
lack of any wit.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.311
You know what,
I even missed your insults.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.080
Well, then we have to
put an end to this.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.315
They need to know
that we are serious.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.784
Okay, everybody.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.353
Repeat after me.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.890
Hey, ho, corporations
putting profits over patients

13:09.990 --> 13:11.558
has got to go!

13:13.793 --> 13:15.462
That's a little too long.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.231
Leave me alone.
It's my first strike.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.432
Come on.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.969
(knocking)

13:22.069 --> 13:24.004
Come in.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.239
Hello, Dottie.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.408
Abishola,
what are you doing here?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.177
I needed to speak with you
alone.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.980
You're leaving Bobby,
aren't you?
What?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.181
No.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.616
Oh, okay, have a seat.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.653
Butterscotch?

13:40.753 --> 13:41.821
No, thank you.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.756
Scotch scotch?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.325
I'm fine.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.429
Okay. So...

13:49.529 --> 13:51.098
what's up?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.067
Bob is struggling
at the factory.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.870
I tried to tell him
it was a bad idea.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.271
Me, too.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.240
But if the two smartest women
in his life

14:00.340 --> 14:02.109
cannot convince him,
nothing will.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.511
(scoffs) What do you
want me to do? Ground him?

14:04.611 --> 14:07.080
I was thinking
we could support him.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.681
You know, maybe if he had
a little cash flow,

14:08.781 --> 14:13.186
he won't spend the entire day
shouting at a drain.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.787
I'm sorry, but Bobby said

14:14.888 --> 14:17.357
he did not want to take
a loan from MaxDot.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.161
Well, I'm not here
for MaxDot's money.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.964
So, this is a shakedown.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.867
When you needed someone
to help you run your company,

14:27.968 --> 14:29.302
Bob was there for you.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.737
(sighs)
And...

14:30.837 --> 14:34.141
when you had your stroke,
Bob was there for you.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.077
Honey, you can't guilt-trip
a guilt-tripper.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.678
I'm not trying to guilt you.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.480
I'm just asking you to have
a little faith

14:40.580 --> 14:42.449
in someone
who has never

14:42.549 --> 14:44.184
let you down.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.387
Well...

14:47.487 --> 14:49.356
he has always been there for me.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.025
And he always will be.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.595
(sighs heavily) Okay.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.763
Okay.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.599
And even if he's making
a stupid mistake,

14:59.699 --> 15:02.369
he's better with us
in his corner than alone.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.603
Sweetie,
you already convinced me.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.804
I know.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.507
Now I'm trying
to convince myself.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.685
That's right, suck it down,
you thirsty son of a bitch.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.823
When you have these
conversations with the drain,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.092
does it talk back?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.393
You come here one more time

15:26.493 --> 15:27.961
to tell me
what a mistake I'm making?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.330
I came to bring you
some food.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.365
Oh, you're apologizing.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.234
No, I'm feeding my husband.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.236
Which is your way
of apologizing.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.538
I accept your jollof.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.774
I should not have been
so critical.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.810
Yeah, well,
there's a lot to criticize.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.345
But I got a win today.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.080
You string a couple of those
together,

15:47.180 --> 15:48.248
you get a streak going.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.749
That is why I love you.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.118
You never give up.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.785
I can't afford to,
I'm doing this on my own.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.055
Not anymore.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.956
A check from my mom?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.492
A big check from my mom.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.228
She wants you to know
that she believes in you.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.662
Is that why it says
in the memo line

16:02.762 --> 16:04.897
"Don't make me regret this"?
(chuckles)

16:04.998 --> 16:07.567
I promised her a seven percent
return on investment.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.501
Wow, that's all?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.770
I talked her down from 20.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.605
And I want you to know

16:12.705 --> 16:14.874
that I believe in you
as well.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.345
Are you sure about this?

16:18.445 --> 16:22.315
Yes, at eight percent interest.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.784
It's a pretty crazy investment.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.719
I heard the guy running it's
talking to drains.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.155
I'm an independent woman.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.190
You cannot tell me
what to do with my money.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.525
And that is why I love you.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.996
You know what this is, right?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.465
A winning streak.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.838
Oh, look at that,
we have a skylight now.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.952
I saw you got the roofers
to start today.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.054
Did you have to yell at them?

17:01.154 --> 17:02.922
I yelled at them with money.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.557
Like a boss.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.193
I had to pay a little extra,

17:06.293 --> 17:08.595
but we'll make it back quick,
Mom, don't worry.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.762
I'm not worried, honey.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.764
Why would you be?
It's his funeral.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.800
I'm rooting for you, buddy.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.269
I'm an investor now.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.004
Hey, does that come
with a seat on the board?

17:18.105 --> 17:20.840
So far, the only boards are
falling from the roof.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.642
Wait, you invested in this?

17:22.742 --> 17:23.943
You called it his Hindenburg.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.478
(scoffs) I believe in you.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.582
I do not think
that analogy is appropriate.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.919
The Hindenburg was fully
operational when it exploded.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.587
GOODWIN:
I did not approve

17:34.687 --> 17:35.722
using MaxDot funds.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.257
I didn't,
I used the money

17:37.357 --> 17:39.159
I was going to leave
to Douglas and Christina.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.860
BOTH:
What?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.895
Wonderful.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.197
Hey, listen.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.032
I can do whatever I want,
it's my money.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.335
But when you died,
it was gonna be mine.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.938
It's gonna cost a lot to process
the grief of losing you.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.306
All this means is,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
is when MaxDot manufacturing
takes off,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.444
we're all gonna do well.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.312
Uh-huh.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.880
We need a lawyer.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.015
Instead of waiting
for Mom to die,

18:03.116 --> 18:05.118
how about you climb on board
and help me?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.755
I don't see
why we can't do both.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.190
What about you, Kofo?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.558
You're the only one
that's not invested.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.692
You want to get in on this?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.094
What a wonderful opportunity.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.629
No, thank you.
