00:25.708 --> 00:27.291
[upbeat music]

02:16.500 --> 02:17.791
[slow music]

02:19.791 --> 02:20.708
[horns honking]

02:29.333 --> 02:31.041
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.291
Goodnight Mr. Ferguson.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.750
Goodnight Mr. Ferguson.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.083
Night Penny, night Brenda.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.583
[man] I'll never make this connection
at Munich.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.750
Nonsense Joe, you can always take a taxi.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.666
The firm can stand it, look
have a good trip.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.041
What about the exchange?

02:50.208 --> 02:51.916
You've got your Deutschmarks, don't you?

02:52.083 --> 02:53.625
Yes, but I can't speak the language.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.166
It'll be fine when you're there
isn't that what you tell clients?

02:56.333 --> 02:58.291
I hope you enjoy your trip, sir.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.708
-Thank you.
-I'm terribly sorry, we're closed.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.666
Oh, I just want to make an enquiry.
Just a little enquiry.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.916
-A little enquiry?
-About a big party, 12 girls besides me.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.000
Come in.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.000
I'm bringing them over for the festival.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.541
It has to do with
the Boston Ladies Literary Circle.

03:13.708 --> 03:15.125
-You're a member?
-That's right.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.000
Did you have figured me
for someone who couldn't read?

03:17.166 --> 03:20.791
I couldn't see you in a circle of Literary
ladies, in Boston or anywhere else.

03:20.958 --> 03:22.958
-You needn't bother to wait.
-[Joe groans]

03:23.125 --> 03:25.208
-Something wrong?
-Toothache. Filling's quite loose.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.125
I can't go, I shall have to see a dentist.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.583
-Sounds psychological to me.
-It doesn't sound.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.875
Come on Joe on your way.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.041
One thing I'm going to do,
before I get on the plane.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.583
You're going to buy life insurance
for if you don't survive the flight.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.333
Well it'll soften the blow for my wife,
if it is a blow.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.750
30 years a travel agent and he's never
been further than the Isle of Man.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.833
I'm sending him to
the fleshpots of Europe,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.625
you'd think he was being
dropped in the Sahara.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.875
-With a compass and a chocolate. [laughs]
-[she sneers]

03:49.041 --> 03:51.291
Still that's not the problem
at the moment, is it Mrs.--

03:51.458 --> 03:53.916
Shoemaker. Mrs. Jackson P. Shoemaker.
Maggie to you.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.666
Shoemaker. Sounds like someone
who went on the Mayflower.

03:56.833 --> 03:59.666
You're right, my ancestors did
but I came back by jet.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.666
Do you mind if I make a call?
Help yourself.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.833
No. You go right ahead.
Say I just love your filing system.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.833
Your wife?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.250
Not quite… yet.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.375
-Fiancée?
-I'll tell you tomorrow.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.083
Hello Stella, love, how are you?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.541
Bursting to see you.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.833
Oh and darling for once,
I'm absolutely ready on time.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.083
Hmm, hmm.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.791
Right down to the last button.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.666
Well for once darling,
I'm afraid I'm going to keep you waiting.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.083
Yes I know it's happened before,
but it's business.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.500
Yes darling, look, can we make it
at quarter past?

04:30.666 --> 04:33.083
Alright. Order yourself a drink
and one for me too.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.458
Yes I love… I mean I feel the same.

04:36.625 --> 04:37.833
Goodbye, Stella darling.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.916
-Nice name, Stella.
-Nice girl.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.791
What does she do
when she isn't waiting for you?

04:41.958 --> 04:44.541
-She works at an Art Gallery.
-Well here's to your future fiancée.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.583
-Thank you.
-[she laughs]

04:46.750 --> 04:49.000
You know what you said
about the Mayflower?

04:49.166 --> 04:51.166
Reminded me of a very funny story I heard

04:51.333 --> 04:52.791
while I was in Maine, last summer.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.333
Now we were invited to these people,

04:54.500 --> 04:57.000
who have a wonderful house
right on the beach.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.458
[instrumental music]

05:04.375 --> 05:06.625
[Stella] Next weekend down at your place.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.625
I think it sounds terribly exciting Ian,
I'd love to.

05:09.791 --> 05:11.375
-Would you?
-Of course I would.

05:11.541 --> 05:13.791
I adore beagling,
it's one of my favourite things.

05:13.958 --> 05:16.166
Darling, sorry to be late.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.000
Oh, it doesn't matter at all.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.041
I wasn't sure if you were coming or not.

05:20.208 --> 05:22.625
-Stella, really I--
-So I asked Ian to have a drink.

05:22.791 --> 05:24.708
And he said he would,
wasn't that sweet of him?

05:24.875 --> 05:26.750
-Very.
-Ian's having dinner here too.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.958
-Really?
-Yes and he's all on his own.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.583
-Isn't that a shame?
-Yes.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.250
Still if people want to dine alone,

05:32.416 --> 05:35.166
I don't think it's anybody else's business
to prevent them.

05:35.333 --> 05:38.000
It's entirely your own affair and I'm sure
you've got your reasons.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.083
Yes of course.

05:40.791 --> 05:42.375
Well cheerio Stella.

05:42.833 --> 05:43.833
I enjoyed the drink.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.541
-Cheerio Ferguson.
-Cheerio.

05:54.958 --> 05:57.041
[slow piano music]

05:58.791 --> 06:01.000
I think we could have
some more coffee too, don't you?

06:01.166 --> 06:02.916
-If you want it.
-Oh I want it.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.166
Yes, so do I.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.333
Then I think I'd better be getting home.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.625
[Ferguson] Look Stella.

06:08.791 --> 06:11.583
We've known each other for two years
and what have we got to show for it?

06:11.750 --> 06:13.666
No trophies in the trophy room, Bill.

06:13.833 --> 06:17.125
-No stories for the boys.
-That's unfair and you know it.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.875
It is not unfair and I do not know it.

06:20.041 --> 06:23.750
I don't want to be just one more
in a long line of those you've loved.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.416
You would never be that, Stella.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.791
It so happens, that you're… different.

06:28.125 --> 06:31.041
That's nice. Not original but nice.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.500
-Do you mean you don't believe me?
-In a way.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.333
Yes I believe you.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.000
You can remove the hurt child expression
and replace it with quizzical adult.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.291
If we're going to be adult,
we ought to behave like adults.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.166
And how do adults behave?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.416
For one thing, they don't limit themselves

06:46.583 --> 06:49.291
to goodnight kisses
and chaste telephone conversations.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.958
What do they limit themselves to?

06:51.125 --> 06:54.500
Stella, let's go up to my place.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.333
Oh they do, do they.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.833
You're morbidly suspicious.

06:58.208 --> 07:01.041
If ever a man deserved to be
morbidly suspected.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.916
If there's one thing I can't bear
it's being overheard and overlooked.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.000
It cramps my style.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.375
With a style like yours,
a little cramp can be a very good thing.

07:11.541 --> 07:14.416
Stella, are we going or not?

07:18.208 --> 07:21.000
-It's a strange thing about human beings.
-What?

07:21.166 --> 07:23.166
They take so long to make up their minds

07:23.333 --> 07:25.125
to do what they wanted to do all along.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.125
Not really.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.125
Only human beings know
the joys of suspense.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.333
That's true.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.291
That's very true.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.125
-Bill, is something the matter?
-Yes, I'm rather afraid there is.

07:40.291 --> 07:41.625
Is it a secret we can share?

07:42.083 --> 07:44.625
It's a secret we're going to have to
share. I can't find my front door key.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.833
Office, car, safe, no front door key.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.375
I always keep it in my trouser pocket.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.500
-Oh blast the thing!
-Oh never mind.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.416
-Of course I mind.
-It doesn't matter.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.416
-It's not that important.
-It is important to me.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.791
-You must admit, it's rather funny.
-[Bill] I don't think it's funny at all.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.208
-Well, it's not all that funny.
-[Stella laughs]

08:02.375 --> 08:03.541
You don't seem to mind a bit.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.958
Oh I do… a bit.
After all, it isn't everything.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.458
It's pretty nearly everything, believe me.

08:09.625 --> 08:13.000
There's no need to boast to me
about your long, dishonourable career.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.375
If you weren't quite
so embarrassingly innocent.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.666
I'd take a crow-bar from my handbag
and break the door down, I suppose.

08:21.833 --> 08:24.875
No look darling, I'll pop downstairs
and see if the janitor has a pass key.

08:25.041 --> 08:25.958
[Stella] No, Bill.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.500
-It's the obvious thing to do.
-Yes but I don't like the obvious thing.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.208
Well at this rate, I'm going to be dossing
on the stairs all night.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.041
You could always go to a hotel.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.916
A hotel. Of course darling.
That is the answer.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.750
I'll tell you what we do, we'll pop
into the car and run into the country

08:40.916 --> 08:44.125
and look for some quiet
little country pub where…

08:45.041 --> 08:46.625
Darling, what's wrong?

08:46.791 --> 08:49.250
Bill, I never realized
what a thoroughly bad loser you were.

08:49.416 --> 08:50.291
Oh, no, darling, I--

08:50.458 --> 08:53.166
You don't care how you humiliate people
to get what you want!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.666
-I think it's horrible.
-For heaven's sake, what's the difference?

08:55.833 --> 08:57.375
All the difference in the world.

08:57.541 --> 08:58.916
Ten minutes ago I wanted you.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.666
Now I don't want you a bit,
not one tiny bit!

09:02.625 --> 09:04.333
Stella, Stella wait.

09:04.708 --> 09:05.666
[Bill] Stella, I…

09:05.833 --> 09:08.666
It so happens that I have an important
golf match tomorrow afternoon.

09:08.833 --> 09:12.125
I wonder if you'd have the grace
to conduct your romantic activities

09:12.291 --> 09:14.291
within the privacy of your own apartments.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.708
I assure you, sir,
nothing would give me greater pleasure.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.583
-Stella wait, Stella wait!
-[door closed]

09:18.750 --> 09:21.333
Why don't you go
into your own flat and keep quiet!

09:21.500 --> 09:22.833
Oh why don't… why don't you?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.666
I want to see you inside that door

09:24.833 --> 09:27.166
before I know I'm safe
from further disturbance.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.083
[door slams]

09:32.875 --> 09:35.250
[Bill] Can you find me a single room
and a double scotch, do you think?

09:35.416 --> 09:36.750
And get me Edinburgh 3459.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.500
[receptionist] I think we might manage
that for you Mr. Ferguson.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.083
A large whisky for Mr. Ferguson.

09:42.833 --> 09:43.791
Maggie!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.041
[Maggie] Hi Bill.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.625
Hello Maggie. I've got great news for you.
Great news.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.750
Don't tell me. You've done it.
You've got engaged.

09:49.916 --> 09:52.666
Engaged. I've got disengaged,
disinterested, disgusted.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.458
-You need a drink.
-I've just ordered one, make that two.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.666
[Maggie] You'd better make it three.
What happened?

09:57.833 --> 10:00.375
I lost my wretched latch key.
And we had a flaming row.

10:00.541 --> 10:02.125
-So love's locked out.
-So am I.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.708
-I've got to spend the night here.
-It's all my fault…

10:04.875 --> 10:06.250
For keeping you late at the office.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.208
[receptionist] I wonder if you'd
oblige me Mr. Ferguson.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.333
Oh right.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.541
[some ladies laugh]

10:13.083 --> 10:15.583
[mysterious music plays]

10:16.666 --> 10:18.833
Excuse me, I've got a date
with a powder puff.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.708
-I'll be right back.
-Of course.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.291
How you doing with
that number I asked for?

10:22.458 --> 10:25.208
-They don't seem to answer.
-Keep trying, he's probably asleep.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.625
[slow orchestral music]

10:34.166 --> 10:35.333
[suspenseful music]

10:44.125 --> 10:45.458
Hello Joe, did I get you up?

10:46.208 --> 10:49.000
Well sorry but I'm afraid I've got
rather a disappointment for you.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.041
I hope you don't take it too badly…

10:52.208 --> 10:54.541
That's right, I'm going
and you're staying.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.291
[laughs] I didn't think you'd mind.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.958
All right Joe, see you
at the airport at noon. Bye.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.250
Do I gather that you're
proposing to flee the country?

11:01.416 --> 11:03.208
I've had it Maggie,
I've absolutely had it.

11:03.375 --> 11:05.083
Women just aren't worth
worrying about frankly.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.208
You're retiring?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.375
I'm retiring from squabbles
and reconciliations.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.166
All that sort of nonsense.
It's not worth it.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.791
Excuse me, sir. Your room key.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.875
Surprise. Surprise.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.541
Where the devil did you find that?

11:15.708 --> 11:18.541
You had it on you all the time,
in the turn up of your pants.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.791
-Well I'll be…
-Jiggered, I know. [laughs]

11:20.958 --> 11:22.375
Suppose you go and ring Stella.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.416
-Ring Stella… I'm damned if I do.
-Oh Bill.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.416
Look Maggie, there are
over 1,000 million women in the world.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.375
If 1% of them happen to be attractive

11:29.541 --> 11:32.375
that means there are ten million women
I could marry if I wanted to.

11:32.541 --> 11:35.208
If you're gonna make
a selection from ten million women

11:35.375 --> 11:39.041
you'd better be on your way boy,
while you still have health and strength.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.416
And then you get the 11-28 from Innsbruck.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.666
-Cutting it a bit fine, isn't?
-Nonsense, you've bags of time.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.583
-Take a taxi.
-All right Joe.

11:45.750 --> 11:48.208
-[man] You'll be back for the festival?
-Ok I will sure return.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.166
-[announcer] <i>Flight 897 to London.</i>
-That's you. Have a good trip.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.333
Thanks, by the way, how's the toothache?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.833
Toothache? Oh completely cured.
Amazing isn't it?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.166
-Amazing.
-[both laugh]

11:57.333 --> 11:58.250
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

11:59.583 --> 12:02.208
[suspenseful music playing]

12:03.916 --> 12:05.250
[Maggie] Hi Bill!

12:05.916 --> 12:08.250
Maggie, what are you doing here?
You're not leaving are you?

12:08.416 --> 12:10.583
No, I just came to see you off,
and give you this.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.083
-What's this?
-A present.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.333
Oh Maggie, how nice of you.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.791
[laughs] Insurance against
further disappointments.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.333
-This way, sir.
-Right.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.916
-Keep one in each pocket.
-Don't worry, I will. Goodbye Maggie.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.375
Bye, Bill.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.000
[horns honking]

12:37.166 --> 12:38.875
He left for Europe this morning.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.041
I'm sorry miss Napier, but there it is.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.500
Well where do you think he'd be?

12:42.666 --> 12:44.583
Oh here, there, everywhere.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.166
Look, I suggest you write to him,
care of our man, Fred Gorham, in Austria.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.500
There's his address.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.875
You can tell Mr. Ferguson
when you write to him,

12:53.041 --> 12:56.041
that I've got his address
but I'll not be writing to him, ever.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.333
Good day.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.583
[horn blowing]

13:00.750 --> 13:01.708
Stella.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.416
Ian… how nice.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.000
Lovely day, isn't it.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.500
Yes, yes indeed.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.791
Just right for a trip to the lochs.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.750
Yes… yes that would be nice.

13:17.458 --> 13:18.791
[instrumental music]

13:31.000 --> 13:33.583
[cheerful music]

13:39.458 --> 13:43.625
I tell you another idea I had, sir.
It's what I term the madcap dash.

13:43.791 --> 13:44.750
[Bill] I'm sorry?

13:44.916 --> 13:47.875
The madcap dash for
the more daring spirits in the party.

13:48.041 --> 13:51.541
You see they come for eight days
in the splendour of a mountain wonderland.

13:51.708 --> 13:52.708
-Right?
-Right.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.250
And then when they get here we have

13:54.416 --> 13:57.125
what you might call
a supplementary optional surprise tour.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.833
-Four hours in Venice.
-Four hours?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.875
Madcap excursions,
into coach at six in the evening.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.958
All night over the mountains,
Venice by lunchtime.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.333
Twelve guineas, optional extra.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.125
Once they get here, I reckon they
won't be able to resist.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.000
-Don't you agree sir?
-I suppose not, after all they--

14:12.166 --> 14:15.416
Might as well, exactly,
so if I may say so.

14:15.583 --> 14:20.000
It appeals to what I call, the might
as well instinct, to coin a phrase.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.375
I think I might as well
get an early night.

14:22.541 --> 14:25.458
Wait till the end of the cabaret,
if you don't mind, sir.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.875
The manager here is…

14:29.375 --> 14:30.583
Is inclined to be touchy,

14:30.750 --> 14:34.166
I know you wouldn't like to endanger
the block booking arrangements

14:34.333 --> 14:36.125
which has proved advantageous in the past.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.375
Of course not.

14:37.541 --> 14:39.750
[cheerful music playing]

14:42.041 --> 14:43.666
[upbeat instrumental music]

14:52.750 --> 14:53.958
[applause]

14:57.625 --> 15:00.000
Thank you Fred,
you've been very informative.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.583
I think what I'll do is make a madcap
dash, to Venice myself tomorrow.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.875
-Good show, sir.
-Pick you up again in Cortina?

15:06.041 --> 15:09.000
So be it, sir. In that case,
I'll wish you a very<i> bonne nuit</i>,

15:09.166 --> 15:11.583
and trust you'll have
a trouble free voyage.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.125
[unsettling music playing]

15:16.625 --> 15:17.750
[upbeat music]

15:24.125 --> 15:25.458
[Fred] Mr. Ferguson, I thought…

15:26.916 --> 15:29.041
You have our table, thank you.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.958
Oh they always put the tables so
terribly close together in these places,

15:35.125 --> 15:36.000
don't they?

15:36.166 --> 15:38.000
-Don't they.
-What's the hold up, honey?

15:38.166 --> 15:40.708
They put the people so terribly
close together in these places.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.000
If monsieur would--

15:42.166 --> 15:44.083
It's alright.
We'll manage somehow, won't we?

15:44.666 --> 15:45.583
Good heavens!

15:45.750 --> 15:48.375
-Surely it can't be? Fred, surely!
-Surely?

15:48.541 --> 15:50.000
The very man we've been talking about.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.791
-Isn't it so Fred?
-Oh yes sir.

15:51.958 --> 15:55.000
Sorry, I don't recollect ever
having seen you before?

15:55.166 --> 15:58.750
But we've seen you this afternoon,
on the golf course, didn't we, Fred?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.000
Absolutely, sir.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.041
And we both agreed that you're
the very man that we need to help us.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.125
-Right Fred?
-No doubt about it, sir.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.666
-I have your table sir sit down please--
-Why don't you join us?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.500
It's very kind of you, but I have--

16:09.666 --> 16:12.166
Thank you. I think this table
has a very nice position.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.916
[waiter speaking German]
<i>Bitteschön mein Herr.</i>

16:14.083 --> 16:16.250
-Oh thank you.
-[waiter] <i>Bitteschön.</i>

16:16.833 --> 16:19.791
Well now, what can I do to help you Mr.…

16:19.958 --> 16:22.250
Ferguson. Bill Ferguson,
and this is Fred Gorham.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.291
Very happy to know you. My name is Coburn.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.666
-How do you do?
-My name is Lucille.

16:27.916 --> 16:30.833
Well you see Mr. Coburn,
we're both in the travel agency business

16:31.000 --> 16:34.708
and having seen your magnificent form
on the golf course this afternoon.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.166
We thought that you could advise us
on organizing a golfing holiday.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.166
Well that's very nice of you

16:40.333 --> 16:42.458
but I still don't know
what I can do to help.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.833
Well, Fred, will explain the situation,
won't you Fred?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.875
Why yes, of course, Mr. Ferguson.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.708
[Fred] Well you see our idea was
15 rounds of golf in ten days,

16:53.875 --> 16:56.125
with two completely free rest days.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.041
With all the balls you can lose,
for 75 guineas.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.625
My friend Mr. Ferguson here,
thought you'd be exactly the man,

17:02.791 --> 17:04.916
to advise us on the type of course the…

17:05.083 --> 17:07.708
deluxe traveller would
most like to play on.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.833
Sure.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.500
-Thank you.
-[Lucille] What for?

17:11.666 --> 17:12.958
For just being here.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.541
You know it's strange
to be so far away from home.

17:16.708 --> 17:20.000
Tired, lonely and then suddenly
you meet someone who--

17:20.166 --> 17:21.416
[laughs] Congratulations!

17:21.583 --> 17:22.833
-What on?
-Your technique.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.958
-[Bill] Dancing you mean?
-The deep voice, so sincere.

17:26.125 --> 17:29.791
The pretence you are a little boy,
but very experienced all the same.

17:29.958 --> 17:32.791
Alright, let's just be ourselves.
No techniques, agreed?

17:32.958 --> 17:34.041
[Lucille] No technique.

17:34.541 --> 17:35.541
You got a match?

17:37.166 --> 17:38.583
-Your father?
-No.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.166
-[Bill] Your husband?
-Not yet.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.583
-Soon?
-Perhaps.

17:41.750 --> 17:44.166
I suppose these mature men
can be quite attractive.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.291
Yes, especially when
they have six oil wells.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.333
I'm afraid I can't compete with that.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.083
You might.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.875
-Are you married?
-[Bill] Not yet.

17:56.041 --> 17:56.958
Why not?

17:57.125 --> 17:59.791
[Bill] We reach the moment
when we either had to jump right in,

17:59.958 --> 18:02.041
marry and all that, or call it a day.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.208
And you don't want to marry?

18:04.666 --> 18:05.833
Not just now.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.708
Especially not now.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.250
[slow string music playing]

18:23.708 --> 18:26.500
-Are you staying at the hotel?
-[Bill] Yes, are you?

18:26.666 --> 18:27.541
Yes.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.833
The view of the lake
is wonderful isn't it?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.083
Yes, I'm on that side too.

18:33.833 --> 18:37.875
From the second floor,
one can see the Krieger horn.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.166
Our rooms must be quite near. I'm in 39.

18:42.875 --> 18:45.625
We have 41 and 42.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.000
Oh.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.291
I see.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.500
Poor Al sleeps very badly.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.708
He has to take pills.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.916
And when he sleeps, he snores.

18:58.916 --> 19:00.791
A very loud snore.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.041
It is nice having that balcony
outside our rooms.

19:08.125 --> 19:11.541
Yes, it's nice sitting there in the sun.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.333
It's nice in the moonlight too.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.041
[soft music]

19:28.916 --> 19:30.208
[suspenseful music]

19:39.625 --> 19:41.208
[suspenseful music intensifies]

20:05.666 --> 20:06.833
[snoring]

20:09.000 --> 20:10.125
[snoring continues]

20:21.583 --> 20:22.958
[snoring]

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Well hello there, it's a small world.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.250
Oh hello.
[laughs]

20:31.416 --> 20:32.416
Yes it is, indeed.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.041
I didn't know you were next door.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.333
Nor did I-- I mean, yes, neither I.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.750
-You'll never believe what I just did.
-[Bill] What was that?

20:39.916 --> 20:41.666
I'm a guy who needs something
to make me sleep.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.750
-I don't know whether you are.
-Yes, I am actually.

20:43.916 --> 20:46.416
I don't know whether
you have the same thing I have.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.041
That depends what you have.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.708
I have red pills for sleeping and
blue ones, for pepping me up when I wake.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.250
At least I think I have.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.125
Because I just took three of the red ones

20:55.291 --> 20:58.541
and I feel peppy as can be.
And that set me a thinking.

20:58.708 --> 21:02.083
Maybe the blue ones are for sleeping
and the red ones are for pepping me up.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.166
-[laughing] Anyway, we'll see.
-We shall.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.833
Wouldn't that be crazy,
taking three sleeping pills.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.708
-And find yourself awake all night
-[Bill] Crazy.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.916
Could be the coffee.
Caffeine always keeps me awake.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.833
[Coburn] But maybe the tablets
haven't won the battle yet.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.541
Anyway, right now I feel so good
I could climb a mountain.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.666
Well why don't you?

21:19.833 --> 21:22.041
No, I think I'll just use up
these old balls,

21:22.208 --> 21:25.625
and then sit here and watch
the sun come up over the Krieger horn.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.291
[strike the ball]

21:29.166 --> 21:30.083
[glass shattering]

21:30.250 --> 21:33.958
Oh gosh, darn it.
I figure, I'll never lick that slice.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.875
You could take three of the blue pills.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.041
Maybe it was the blue pills I took before,

21:38.208 --> 21:42.208
but if they're pep pills, I'd feel so
full of energy I wouldn't know what to do.

21:42.375 --> 21:45.041
You could take six of the red ones.
No, you'd need to take nine, wouldn't you?

21:45.208 --> 21:47.958
That would give the sleeping pills
a lead of nine to six.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.333
That should be enough, shouldn't it?

21:49.916 --> 21:52.375
Might be dangerous to exceed
more than the stated dose.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.166
Might set up a chain reaction.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.500
No, I guess I'll just have to
sweat it out here all night.

21:57.666 --> 22:00.291
Say you don't play
gin rummy by any chance?

22:00.458 --> 22:02.958
-I'm afraid not.
-You know any other games for two?

22:03.125 --> 22:05.708
Well, I'm afraid I don't.

22:05.875 --> 22:09.291
I know, all you want to do
is to get to bed, right?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.958
-Quite right.
-Well don't let me stop you.

22:12.291 --> 22:13.291
I won't.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.583
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.458
Uh…

22:22.625 --> 22:25.125
Well, I hope you took
the right pills after all.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.166
-[Bill laughs]
-So do I.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.625
[snoring]

22:42.625 --> 22:45.000
[slow tempo music playing]

22:46.791 --> 22:48.208
He's going to be up all night.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.833
Poor Al.
And he wants so badly to go to sleep.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.541
And I so badly want him to.
Come to my room.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.666
No, I don't think so.
He might look in and see I'm not here.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.083
-Tomorrow then?
-I'm afraid not.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.541
By tomorrow night
we shall be on our way to Texas.

23:03.708 --> 23:05.958
We are going to meet his family
and his oil wells.

23:06.125 --> 23:09.458
Oh Lucille, promise me one thing.

23:09.625 --> 23:10.625
What?

23:10.791 --> 23:14.208
That if the family is too refined,
or the oil is too crude.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.583
You'll come to me instead.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.958
Oh Bill, that is very sweet of you.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.500
But that's the sort of thing one say
and one doesn't mean, really.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.500
But I mean it. I do, truly.

23:23.666 --> 23:26.541
But I don't know who you are.
Where you live.

23:27.958 --> 23:30.166
No that's very sweet of you but--

23:31.041 --> 23:35.208
My name and address
and the key to my apartment.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.125
Oh Bill.

23:39.625 --> 23:42.541
That is one of the nicest things
that ever happened to me.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.333
I never thought of it before.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.708
Oh thank you.

23:49.666 --> 23:51.791
No, you must go now.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.541
Otherwise I shall be tempted
to run away with you.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.875
You never know, we might strike oil.

23:57.708 --> 23:58.750
Goodbye Bill.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.291
Au revoir, Lucille.

24:02.583 --> 24:03.875
[soft music]

24:21.500 --> 24:23.416
[soft music continues]

24:33.083 --> 24:34.916
[snoring]

24:52.208 --> 24:53.500
[snoring continues]

24:59.000 --> 25:01.291
[dramatic music]

25:04.000 --> 25:05.375
[dramatic music intensifies]

25:15.000 --> 25:17.375
[train bell]

25:55.750 --> 25:56.958
[instrumental music]

26:17.000 --> 26:19.333
-Have you got the marmalade, Perry?
-[Perry] Yes, Mum.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.125
You know Daddy can't eat breakfast
without his marmalade.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.833
[Dad] Got one Daphne, got one.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.916
Three days old still better than nothing.
You got the marmalade, Perry?

26:27.083 --> 26:28.375
-[Perry] Here, dad.
-[Dad] Good lad.

26:28.916 --> 26:31.000
Can't eat breakfast without marmalade.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.416
How was last night, Mummy?

26:33.583 --> 26:34.958
-What dear?
-Last night.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.791
[girl] The affair you went to
whatever it was.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.375
Oh fascinating.

26:38.541 --> 26:40.000
[Dad] I can't bear those things.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.583
They go on all night and you're fit
for nothing the next morning.

26:43.416 --> 26:45.416
Just as well you weren't there dear.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.541
As long as you enjoyed yourself, my dear.
That's the best thing.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.666
I enjoyed myself very much, thank you.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.916
Personally, I don't think one does
that sort of thing nearly often enough.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.083
[Dad] So long as you don't ask me
to sit up,

27:00.250 --> 27:02.208
listening to lectures
on Venetian folk art.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.708
I don't dear.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.541
[Dad throat clearing]

27:08.708 --> 27:11.416
[soft music playing]

27:11.583 --> 27:12.583
[waiter] Signore.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.583
[speaking Italian] <i>Si signore.</i>

27:14.750 --> 27:17.000
I want to give this key
to the lady at the table there.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.333
-I understand, signore.
-Without anyone seeing.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.666
I understand completely.

27:20.833 --> 27:22.791
If I may make a suggestion, signore.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.833
[slow string music playing]

27:27.708 --> 27:30.291
-You understand, signore?
-I quite understand. Excellent.

27:35.958 --> 27:39.125
[gradual music playing]

27:39.291 --> 27:40.833
[dramatic music]

28:19.208 --> 28:21.916
Ah Gorham, there you are.
Where's our Sherpa, eh?

28:22.083 --> 28:25.333
Don't worry Colonel, the guide will
be here in two shakes of a lambs tail.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.208
Bad staff work, you know.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.666
Oh hello Mr. Ferguson. Alright?

28:30.833 --> 28:32.208
Hello Fred, yes fine thanks.

28:32.375 --> 28:35.000
Not too worn out after
your Venetian blind, I hope.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.125
That's the spirit.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.625
Oh before I forget,
I brought you some mail.

28:38.791 --> 28:39.708
Thank you.

28:40.166 --> 28:41.125
[Fred] Uh…

28:41.291 --> 28:43.208
One of our walking parties
is just going out.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.083
I don't know if you're ramble minded,

28:45.250 --> 28:47.000
but I thought you might
like to go with them.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.333
I don't think so. Thanks all the same.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.333
Oh Ingrid, there you are.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.583
Hello Fred, I'm sorry I'm late
but I was oversleeping as usual.

28:54.750 --> 28:58.250
[Fred] Oh yes, of course, may I introduce

28:58.416 --> 29:02.125
Mr. Ferguson, this is miss Ingrid Lein,
who conducts our walking parties.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.916
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

29:04.541 --> 29:08.166
-Time to be moving, eh Ingrid?
-Yes, of course.

29:08.666 --> 29:10.458
-See you later.
-Yes, indeed.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.125
[Ingrid] Now is everybody here?

29:13.583 --> 29:16.250
Alright then, let's go. Let's take off.

29:16.416 --> 29:19.583
[cheerful music playing]

29:21.833 --> 29:24.166
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

29:25.708 --> 29:28.458
[Fred] Oh, is something wrong?
Not bad news I hope.

29:29.416 --> 29:31.500
No nothing, doesn't matter a bit.

29:31.666 --> 29:34.625
Just an old friend of mine's
just gone and got herself engaged.

29:34.791 --> 29:38.708
It's the old flames that burn the longest,
that's what I always say.

29:38.875 --> 29:39.958
Do you?

29:40.625 --> 29:42.750
I wonder if you'd care to take a dekko

29:42.916 --> 29:45.958
at the advance publicity
for the coming <i>saison</i>.

29:46.125 --> 29:48.458
I don't think so.
I'll just go for a walk I think.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.083
[Fred] Oh, she went that way.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.750
In that case, I'll go in that direction.
I want to clear my thoughts.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.833
Just in case you change your mind sir,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.333
you can take the short cut
over the mountain path,

29:58.500 --> 29:59.625
if you know what I mean.

29:59.791 --> 30:02.083
I know, thank you Fred. See you anon.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.458
[soft music]

30:30.166 --> 30:33.041
[Ingrid] Over here and to the right
is the Klopfspitzen,

30:33.208 --> 30:35.750
and right to your left
you see the Zugspitze.

30:37.416 --> 30:41.666
[dramatic music]

30:48.791 --> 30:50.875
-Behind this mountain--
-[Bill] Hey!

30:51.708 --> 30:52.916
Hey!

30:53.958 --> 30:55.458
I'm stuck!

30:55.625 --> 30:57.625
Looks like there's
some chappie stuck up there.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.666
It should be easy to get down from there.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.833
May be easy for you my dear,
but we're not all as experienced as you.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.458
[Bill speaking German]<i> Ich bin "shtuck."</i>

31:06.416 --> 31:09.083
It's your bounden duty
to go to his assistance.

31:10.250 --> 31:11.833
Turn to the left!

31:13.875 --> 31:15.125
The left.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.333
[Ingrid] That's right. Keep going!

31:21.500 --> 31:22.750
To the left!

31:23.458 --> 31:25.750
I can't! Sheer precipice.

31:25.916 --> 31:27.583
If you won't go, I will.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.000
I'm afraid you're not really
what's wanted Miss Bradshaw.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.875
Don't worry, I can get this lot
back without you.

31:33.416 --> 31:36.000
Thank you very much colonel,
I see I can trust you.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.250
Alright, I'm coming!

31:42.166 --> 31:44.625
[Colonel] Party prepare to return to base.

31:44.791 --> 31:47.208
About turn. Quick. March.

31:51.541 --> 31:52.666
Brave girl.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.833
[soft music playing]

32:04.541 --> 32:06.250
[dramatic music playing]

32:26.916 --> 32:29.000
[dramatic music intensifies]

32:50.916 --> 32:52.208
Oh there you are.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.541
Exactly as I thought.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.916
You could have easily got down
without any trouble.

32:57.083 --> 33:01.000
Well I lost my nerve. I… panicked.
I felt I needed someone.

33:01.166 --> 33:04.125
Someone competent,
and confident and… blonde.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.125
You're a naughty boy, Mr. Ferguson.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.708
Alarmingly naughty, I'm afraid,

33:07.875 --> 33:09.750
but I feel much safer,
now that you're here.

33:09.916 --> 33:12.166
And I would feel much safer
if we were down there.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.666
Surely you're not afraid of me.

33:13.833 --> 33:16.791
Oh no, only we have to get down
before the mist comes up.

33:16.958 --> 33:19.041
-Time for a cigarette?
-No.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.041
I don’ know what it is
but I feel a bit dizzy.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.583
Perhaps it is the height.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.583
-Don't you feel dizzy?
-Not at all.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.708
It's alright for you.
You're a professional.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.875
-And are you not?
-No, I'm an amateur.

33:31.041 --> 33:33.416
Well I'm an amateur too,
I do this only in the summer.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.250
In the winter I study music.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.291
But now we must go.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.500
Feeling dizzy?

33:42.666 --> 33:43.583
Look.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.291
[dramatic music]

33:46.000 --> 33:47.166
-Don't move.
-I won't.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.750
-Catch hold of me.
-I will.

33:48.916 --> 33:51.375
To move can be dangerous,
when the weather is like this.

33:51.541 --> 33:54.000
Sometimes it is safer
to not go down until it clears.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.541
Won't they send a search party?

33:55.708 --> 33:59.125
Not if we telephone from the refuge hut
and tell them we're safe.

33:59.291 --> 34:00.291
Refuge hut?

34:00.458 --> 34:03.291
Oh yes, sometimes people
get stuck all night.

34:05.833 --> 34:08.125
[dramatic music playing]

34:09.958 --> 34:11.208
[Ingrid sighs]

34:14.500 --> 34:19.500
There really seems to be everything here.
Food, stove, blankets.

34:21.541 --> 34:22.458
A bunk.

34:23.125 --> 34:24.333
Two bunks.

34:26.458 --> 34:27.958
It's very cold in here.

34:28.125 --> 34:30.916
Why don't you go and fetch some wood
while I telephone the hotel, yes?

34:31.083 --> 34:31.958
Right.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.041
[birds singing]

34:50.166 --> 34:52.833
[birds singing]

34:54.875 --> 34:57.833
[speaking German]<i> Vielen Dank,</i>
<i>auf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen.</i>

34:58.500 --> 34:59.708
[Ingrid] Oh that's good.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.666
[Ingrid] How's the weather now?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.208
Well… it couldn't be better,
we could go back.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.083
Go back? Oh no.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.083
We couldn't go back
now that we've told everybody

35:15.250 --> 35:16.625
that we're stuck up here.

35:16.791 --> 35:18.125
No, we simply couldn't.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.666
Yes and having made a nice fire,

35:19.833 --> 35:22.041
it would be such a shame to have
put it out.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.583
It would be a shame.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.625
Yes, it is getting hotter in here,
isn't it?

35:28.791 --> 35:29.833
Very.

35:30.166 --> 35:31.250
Can I help?

35:31.625 --> 35:32.625
Perhaps.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.791
[dramatic music playing]

35:44.750 --> 35:45.875
[dramatic music]

35:49.291 --> 35:53.875
You are a naughty boy… Mr. Ferguson.

35:55.541 --> 35:58.583
[dramatic music playing]

36:05.458 --> 36:06.625
[Spanish guitar music]

36:28.458 --> 36:31.916
[Spanish guitar music continues]

36:38.458 --> 36:41.916
How's it going, dear?
The wine I brought you is for real studs.

36:42.083 --> 36:44.750
-How long have you been away from home?
-[Bill] Too long it seems.

36:44.916 --> 36:47.708
We've been three months,
that's too much for a married man.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.958
What do you say?
She gets engaged to another man.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.375
-And now she wants to marry him.
-Seems sort of logical to me.

36:53.541 --> 36:55.000
Like to see what I gotta go back to.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.208
-That's my wife.
-Very nice too.

36:57.375 --> 36:58.375
And those are the kids.

36:58.541 --> 37:01.500
That's Lulu and that's Windsor
and that's Wilton up the tree.

37:01.666 --> 37:04.000
-Delightful.
-Marriage is a great thing for a man.

37:04.166 --> 37:06.708
It keeps them, you know,
steady, on the rails.

37:06.875 --> 37:07.833
Hey Joe!

37:08.375 --> 37:10.166
How say we go that place down the road?

37:10.333 --> 37:12.791
Yeah! Eddie says they do dance
in the nude in there.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.833
-Come on. They got girls!
-You know girls.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.083
[all] Girls. Senoritas. Women.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.375
[Eddie] Leave him alone,
he doesn't want any women.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.708
Can't you see he's love sick.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.583
-[all laughing]
-[Bill] Excuse me boys.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.250
Let's have another drink of that,
don't hog it all.

37:28.666 --> 37:30.666
[Spanish music]

37:31.875 --> 37:35.833
[in broken Spanish] Excuse me,
can I make a phone call to Scotland?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.125
[in Spanish] But of course, my dear!

37:38.291 --> 37:41.041
Here you go. Follow me.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.583
[in Spanish] Hello, miss?

37:49.166 --> 37:51.125
Can you patch me through to Scotland?

37:52.458 --> 37:54.166
No, no, miss.

37:54.333 --> 37:57.500
Not Africa, Scotland, Great Britain.

37:58.583 --> 37:59.625
[telephone ringing]

38:05.625 --> 38:06.750
Hello.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.750
9347, yes.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.166
Yes speaking.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.041
From Spain?

38:15.208 --> 38:16.625
[in Spanish] <i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

38:19.125 --> 38:20.166
Hello Stella.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.041
No, it's me, Bill.

38:22.791 --> 38:24.458
No, no nothing's the matter.

38:24.625 --> 38:28.666
I… just thought it was time
I rang and congratulated you.

38:28.833 --> 38:30.916
And what a very good time to choose.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.833
Sound asleep, yes.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.583
Yes, of course.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.666
Ian's such a wonderful person,
how could I fail to be.

38:41.083 --> 38:44.916
Well as long as you're happy,
that's the great thing.

38:45.083 --> 38:45.958
Happy?

38:46.541 --> 38:47.791
Am I happy?

38:48.333 --> 38:50.083
[Stella laughs and sobs]

38:51.083 --> 38:54.250
Well as long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.666
Stella… there's a terrible din
on this line.

38:59.166 --> 39:00.208
It sounds like…

39:01.541 --> 39:02.875
Stella, it's not you is it?

39:04.458 --> 39:07.375
Darling you're not…
you're not crying are you?

39:07.958 --> 39:11.541
If a girl can't cry when she's happy,
when can she cry.

39:12.208 --> 39:16.041
Well darling, this is
absolutely marvellous, I'm so glad.

39:16.583 --> 39:18.500
Well of course, naturally I'm glad.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.875
No, I don't want you to marry him,
and you're not going to.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.708
I'll tell you what you're going to do…

39:25.583 --> 39:26.666
[Spanish music]

39:32.083 --> 39:33.125
[shouting]

39:35.250 --> 39:37.625
Hey, let's ship Bill home as a souvenir.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.708
Stuffed Englishman in a glass case.

39:39.875 --> 39:40.875
[laughing]

39:45.333 --> 39:46.583
[crash]

39:49.625 --> 39:50.541
Bill.

39:50.708 --> 39:53.083
[Spanish music]

39:54.416 --> 39:55.625
[shouting]

39:55.791 --> 39:57.541
[woman preventing]

39:58.125 --> 40:00.791
[ringing]

40:04.583 --> 40:06.000
Hello. Hello. Senorita.

40:06.875 --> 40:10.083
[in Spanish]
Yes, I believe so. One moment.

40:10.250 --> 40:12.958
You silly idiots! I was just
asking a girl to marry me.

40:13.416 --> 40:15.291
[shouting]

40:16.875 --> 40:19.916
-Stella. Yes it's alright. It's me.
-[others shout loudly]

40:21.541 --> 40:23.000
Of course I meant it.

40:23.500 --> 40:27.333
I can… I can just about
make the last plane.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Yes, I'll be in Edinburgh tomorrow.

40:30.166 --> 40:33.708
Tomorrow. The day after today. Yes.

40:34.250 --> 40:35.500
Meet me at the airport, will you?

40:35.666 --> 40:39.333
Darling… why not… at your flat?

40:39.500 --> 40:41.916
Oh darling Stella,
I'll carry you over the threshold,

40:42.083 --> 40:43.666
but I can't say where I'll put you down.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.125
See you tomorrow, darling.

40:45.291 --> 40:47.250
See you tomorrow, darling. Bye.

40:47.833 --> 40:49.083
[Spanish music]

40:59.541 --> 41:01.750
[cheers and applause]

41:04.083 --> 41:05.916
[dramatic music]

41:24.458 --> 41:26.666
[dramatic music intensifies]

41:28.208 --> 41:29.125
Thank you madam.

41:59.166 --> 42:00.583
[soft music]

42:10.291 --> 42:11.875
[Stella] Darling!

42:12.250 --> 42:13.208
Stella.

42:13.666 --> 42:14.875
[Stella] Darling.

42:15.541 --> 42:16.750
[Bill] Oh darling!

42:18.833 --> 42:19.875
Oh Stella.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.375
[neighbour clears throat]

42:24.416 --> 42:25.458
[soft music]

42:25.625 --> 42:26.666
[Bill] Come on.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.958
-Darling, I missed you so.
-Me too.

42:43.958 --> 42:45.833
Bill, isn't that a little premature?

42:46.000 --> 42:49.083
I'm not going to let you run out
on me again. I've come a long way.

42:49.583 --> 42:51.875
Don't worry darling,
I've waited a long time.

42:52.041 --> 42:53.041
[Stella chuckles]

42:58.458 --> 43:00.208
-Oughtn't we bring the bags in?
-Later.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.416
-Bill.
-Later.

43:01.583 --> 43:03.500
-At least put the flowers in water.
-Later.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.416
Now, or I'll never buy you flowers again.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.541
I will you.

43:07.875 --> 43:09.166
Come on, darling.

43:20.458 --> 43:21.666
[Stella giggles]

43:22.208 --> 43:23.625
Oh Bill, look.

43:24.041 --> 43:25.750
Where did those come from?

43:25.916 --> 43:28.625
I don't know, must be Mrs. MacGregor.

43:28.791 --> 43:30.291
-Mrs. MacGregor?
-My daily.

43:30.458 --> 43:33.333
A lady of indeterminate age,
who sometimes dusts my apartment.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.416
Satisfied?

43:34.583 --> 43:36.125
[Stella chuckles]

43:36.291 --> 43:38.125
[Stella] We really must put
those flowers in water--

43:38.291 --> 43:39.250
[Bill] Hang the flowers.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.000
If we go on holding them, definitely

43:41.166 --> 43:43.916
they're bound to become an embarrassment
sooner or later, don't you agree?

43:45.791 --> 43:48.750
-Just bung them in water, darling.
-Better get a vase if I can.

43:48.916 --> 43:49.916
Later darling.

44:07.708 --> 44:08.750
[water splashing]

44:14.333 --> 44:15.500
Oh Bill!

44:15.666 --> 44:16.791
Bill darling.

44:17.375 --> 44:18.625
Stay where you are, don't move. Shhh…

44:18.791 --> 44:21.583
-But darling, come.
-Stay in the bath.

44:22.291 --> 44:24.583
[dramatic music]

44:34.333 --> 44:36.083
[dramatic music intensifies]

44:37.166 --> 44:38.958
-Bill, darling, what--
-Frightful thing, a pipe burst.

44:39.125 --> 44:40.000
-Burst--
-Gas.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.416
-What?
-Water. Must be the frost.

44:41.583 --> 44:43.166
-Frost in August--
-I mean the heat… sudden expansion…

44:43.333 --> 44:44.875
-What are you going to do?
-Get out of here.

44:45.041 --> 44:46.541
Before we're flooded out.
We'll get a plumber,

44:46.708 --> 44:48.041
there's not a moment to loose.

44:48.208 --> 44:49.125
-Let's phone.
-No, we can't.

44:49.291 --> 44:50.166
-Why not?
-Why not…

44:50.333 --> 44:51.708
I had it cut off before I left.

44:51.875 --> 44:53.166
-We'll phone from the office.
-Must we…

44:53.333 --> 44:54.708
-Unavoidable, I'm afraid.
-Couldn't I wait here?

44:54.875 --> 44:57.666
No, no, that would never do. I need
your help, bringing back the plumber.

44:57.833 --> 45:00.208
Bill, it's so lovely to see you.

45:00.833 --> 45:02.916
And you, yes, you are so alike.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.166
-You must be his sister.
-I'm not his sister.

45:05.333 --> 45:08.791
No. Oh you work at the office then.
Darling, thank you for the flowers.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.166
Stella, Lucille. Look.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.291
-I'm looking!
-There's a perfectly simple explanation.

45:12.458 --> 45:14.333
-[Stella] There certainly is.
-[Bill] She's staying here.

45:14.500 --> 45:17.833
Of course she's staying here,
doesn't look as if she came for tea.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.875
-I mean borrowing the flat.
-And you too?

45:20.041 --> 45:21.958
-You're being absurd.
-I'm absurd, what about you?

45:22.125 --> 45:24.708
-I'm just as surprised as you are.
-I'm not in the least surprised.

45:24.875 --> 45:26.500
Exactly what I expect of you.

45:26.666 --> 45:30.125
With your record, you make Casanova
look underprivileged. Goodbye Bill!

45:30.291 --> 45:31.750
[Bill] If you weren't so pig-headed,

45:31.916 --> 45:34.458
and possessive and jealous
and unreasonable.

45:34.791 --> 45:36.583
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

45:43.916 --> 45:46.208
[Lucille] Here, my darling,
you'll feel better.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.208
My poor Bill.

45:55.625 --> 45:58.666
I know how it's like to get involved
with that sort of person.

45:58.833 --> 46:02.375
Scenes, always scenes,
and you must be tired, sit down.

46:03.208 --> 46:04.250
Thanks.

46:04.750 --> 46:08.166
-[Bill] I thought you were in Texas?
-Al had to go to the Persian Gulf.

46:08.541 --> 46:10.166
Damned unreasonable.

46:10.333 --> 46:12.416
Not really, he had oil wells there.

46:12.916 --> 46:14.041
No I meant--

46:14.208 --> 46:16.916
Don't worry about these things,
she'll get over it.

46:17.083 --> 46:18.041
Find someone else.

46:18.208 --> 46:19.375
I hope not.

46:19.541 --> 46:21.333
Is she the girl you told me about?

46:21.500 --> 46:23.333
Yes, we just got engaged.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.083
Your family has arranged it, eh?

46:25.250 --> 46:27.625
Not at all, we arranged it ourselves.

46:27.791 --> 46:28.833
Oh.

46:29.416 --> 46:32.083
Lucille, do you ever get jealous?

46:32.250 --> 46:33.875
Do you ever make scenes?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.750
I don't need to be jealous.

46:35.916 --> 46:39.083
-How do you mean?
-Well I never stay where I'm not wanted.

46:40.708 --> 46:43.375
How simple you make everything seem.

46:44.458 --> 46:45.833
Do you have a headache?

46:46.458 --> 46:48.000
Umm… A little.

46:48.166 --> 46:51.250
Oh poor little thing, let me help you.

46:52.083 --> 46:53.166
There.

46:55.875 --> 46:57.166
That's nice.

46:57.541 --> 47:01.916
Now tell me about this girl
and all your troubles.

47:02.833 --> 47:05.750
Well you see, she and I…

47:05.916 --> 47:08.791
psychologically we're…

47:11.583 --> 47:12.916
Some other time.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.541
[bagpipe music]

47:34.041 --> 47:36.083
-And it's all my fault.
-I never said that.

47:36.250 --> 47:39.333
All the time I thought I was helping
to pave the way for true love.

47:39.500 --> 47:42.375
What are you going to do with Miss France
when she gets back from her shopping tour?

47:42.541 --> 47:44.708
-I can't turn her out.
-Why not?

47:45.041 --> 47:47.375
There isn't a room to be had in Edinburgh.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.291
We could squeeze her in
with some of my party.

47:50.458 --> 47:53.791
-No, I couldn't possibly have that.
-Oh Bill, you're incorrigible.

47:53.958 --> 47:56.333
-Well it isn't that I'm a cad Maggie.
-Oh no.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.458
It's just that when
Lucille's in the flat I--

47:58.625 --> 48:00.750
You enjoy being persuaded to be a cad.

48:00.916 --> 48:03.041
[laughs] Oh Bill,
you're old enough to know that

48:03.208 --> 48:04.625
you can't have your cake and eat it too.

48:04.791 --> 48:05.666
Can't I?

48:05.833 --> 48:07.416
No. Now you're going to your apartment

48:07.583 --> 48:09.875
to tell miss France, she moves in here
with my party tonight.

48:10.041 --> 48:12.083
-I can't tell her that.
-If you don't, I will.

48:12.250 --> 48:14.000
-[chatter]
-Oh here are my girls.

48:14.625 --> 48:16.000
[dramatic music plays]

48:19.541 --> 48:22.625
-Oh girls, this is Mr. Ferguson.
-[group] Hi, pleased to meet you.

48:22.791 --> 48:23.708
Hello.

48:23.875 --> 48:27.166
I do hope you'll be very happy here.
If there's anything I can do.

48:27.333 --> 48:29.166
Mr. Ferguson has very kindly
invited us all,

48:29.333 --> 48:31.625
to the reception at the Art Gallery
this evening.

48:31.791 --> 48:32.958
[chatter]

48:33.125 --> 48:34.833
And now we'll go on
that little reconnaissance.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.041
See if Miss<i> Parlez-Vous </i>has gotten home.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.208
Bill.

48:40.708 --> 48:43.416
-[she chuckles] Oh Bill.
-Oh yes, of course.

48:44.208 --> 48:46.083
I thought you said
they were literary ladies.

48:46.250 --> 48:48.541
I said the literary circle
was sending over a party.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.208
These are the daughters and nieces
of the members.

48:52.208 --> 48:53.791
Do you suppose he'll be at the reception?

48:53.958 --> 48:56.833
Wouldn't you just love
to see him in one of those kilt things?

48:57.000 --> 49:00.916
It makes me real mad the way the middle
aged women grab all the mature men.

49:01.083 --> 49:02.291
Yeah.

49:07.750 --> 49:08.625
Anyone about?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.125
[woman] Just a minute.

49:11.833 --> 49:13.625
How would you like me to introduce you?

49:13.791 --> 49:15.666
Old pal, old flame, old Maggie,
anything you like.

49:15.833 --> 49:17.833
-Right, fine.
-I'll introduce myself. How's that?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.041
Splendid.

49:19.833 --> 49:21.208
I, I'll just…

49:22.291 --> 49:23.291
[knocking]

49:24.000 --> 49:27.083
[Maggie] Hello.
Mind if I introduce myself? I'm Maggie.

49:31.125 --> 49:32.083
Hello Stella.

49:32.250 --> 49:34.625
Now look darling I… No, no listen.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.916
If you will just listen, I'll ex--

49:37.291 --> 49:39.583
I know she moved in.
But she's moving out now.

49:39.750 --> 49:41.750
Yes, I've fixed her at a hotel.

49:41.916 --> 49:45.333
No not the usual one. I mean,
no not the one I was going to take you…

49:45.500 --> 49:46.500
Stella.

49:47.458 --> 49:48.750
[Stella angrily shouting]

49:51.458 --> 49:52.458
Stella.

49:52.833 --> 49:54.083
Are you there?

50:00.333 --> 50:02.958
That's really a very lovely,
little blonde number you have in there.

50:03.125 --> 50:04.583
Really? Maggie, Lucille's a redhead.

50:04.750 --> 50:07.541
Yes, well that's really a lovely
little blonde number in there.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.291
You ought to get new filters
for your glasses.

50:09.458 --> 50:12.000
Maybe so. But it's really
a lovely little blonde number

50:12.166 --> 50:14.458
and she doesn't answer
to the name of Lucille.

50:14.625 --> 50:15.958
You don't… she isn't?

50:16.541 --> 50:19.583
Yes, unless I'm very much mistaken,
the gang's all here.

50:21.916 --> 50:23.166
-[Ingrid] Oh Billiam!
-[Bill] Ingrid!

50:23.333 --> 50:26.875
Billie, how wonderful to see you again.
Are you not pleased to see me?

50:27.041 --> 50:30.291
Of course, ecstatic. Welcome to the team.

50:30.458 --> 50:33.708
So you do not forget you invitation
that night on the Klopschpitz, did you?

50:33.875 --> 50:35.875
No of course not. Excuse me.

50:36.041 --> 50:39.333
[Bill] Maggie, don't go, Maggie.
Can't you see I need a chaperone.

50:39.500 --> 50:42.333
What you need Bill, isn't a chaperone.
It's a twin.

50:43.000 --> 50:43.958
Maggie, I…

50:47.291 --> 50:50.500
Bill look, I've brought you some flowers.

50:50.666 --> 50:55.125
Oh how marvellous, I'd better go and…

50:55.291 --> 50:56.166
Sure.

51:03.833 --> 51:05.291
[water running]

51:12.958 --> 51:15.083
Well, well that's fine. There we are then.

51:15.958 --> 51:18.500
Have you any idea how long
you're likely to be staying in Edinburgh?

51:18.666 --> 51:21.333
I won't stay too long,
come and sit down Billiam.

51:21.833 --> 51:24.166
-Of course.
-You're not sorry that I'm here, are you?

51:24.333 --> 51:27.000
-Well I…
-But I think you are sorry.

51:27.166 --> 51:30.583
No, on the contrary. I'm delighted,
just slightly overwhelmed, that's all.

51:30.750 --> 51:33.041
Have you found all you want
in the way of towels and--

51:33.208 --> 51:35.500
-Thank you, we've managed perfectly.
-We?

51:35.958 --> 51:37.125
Oh then you have met Lucille.

51:37.291 --> 51:40.166
Lucille, oh she is the one
who has the other bedroom?

51:40.333 --> 51:42.458
Yes she is staying here
for a little while.

51:42.625 --> 51:44.833
For the festival. She likes Schoenberg.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.833
If she likes Schoenberg,
why doesn't she stay with Schoenberg?

51:48.000 --> 51:51.708
Oh Billiam, you are a naughty boy,
a naughty, naughty boy.

51:51.875 --> 51:53.708
Well you're not so goody goody yourself.

51:53.875 --> 51:56.833
The way you left that tourist party
to wander on the mountains,

51:57.000 --> 51:58.625
they might have fallen down a crevasse.

51:58.791 --> 52:00.750
I had to rescue the injured Englishman.

52:00.916 --> 52:03.791
-It was a great rescue.
-So you haven't forgotten?

52:03.958 --> 52:05.875
Forgotten? How could I?

52:06.291 --> 52:08.875
-[string music playing]
-Oh!

52:09.041 --> 52:11.083
This sofa is so nice and soft.

52:11.250 --> 52:13.291
Much softer than the bunk in the mountain.

52:13.458 --> 52:15.041
And much more convenient.

52:15.208 --> 52:16.083
[she sighs]

52:16.250 --> 52:18.375
You know Billiam, the next time
we go to the mountains,

52:18.541 --> 52:20.958
we take the sofa with us. Yes?

52:21.125 --> 52:22.291
Yes.

52:22.625 --> 52:25.166
-Nice Bill.
-Nice Ingrid.

52:25.916 --> 52:28.625
Oh I wish there was no Lucille and no--

52:28.791 --> 52:30.458
-[door opens]
-[man] Here I am!

52:30.625 --> 52:33.708
What's happening?

52:33.875 --> 52:36.333
[Ingrid] Oh Giulio, you have
finished rehearsal, yes?

52:36.500 --> 52:38.583
And you have started rehearsal, no?

52:38.750 --> 52:42.500
Bill, I want you to meet Giulio,
my friend. Giulio, this is Bill.

52:42.666 --> 52:45.458
Don't be a naughty boy now.
The owner of the apartment.

52:45.625 --> 52:48.333
Ah I see. I make the presentation now.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.291
This is a small token of gratitude.

52:50.458 --> 52:52.291
Thank you. Very nice of you.

52:52.458 --> 52:54.958
I'll just go and put them in some water.

53:00.291 --> 53:01.291
Where are you going?

53:01.458 --> 53:03.500
Oh I just want to help Bill
with the flowers.

53:03.666 --> 53:05.208
You are much too friendly with him, no?

53:05.375 --> 53:08.000
I'm not half as friendly with him,
as I'm with you.

53:12.416 --> 53:15.833
-Who's your Italian friend?
-Well… I met him in Rome.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.833
You know he said he was
coming to Edinburgh,

53:18.000 --> 53:19.583
to play in the festival and so I said.

53:19.750 --> 53:22.583
I had the key to an apartment,
and I would come too.

53:23.458 --> 53:25.333
Billiam, you're not angry?

53:25.500 --> 53:26.666
No not at all angry.

53:26.833 --> 53:30.458
But if anyone else brings me flowers,
I'll have to get another bathroom fitted.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.041
[instrumental music]

53:32.208 --> 53:35.708
[Bill] Can I get you a drink
before you begin the… begin?

53:35.875 --> 53:37.666
Thank you. I don't touch alcohol.

53:39.708 --> 53:42.583
But if you insist, I'll take
a milkshake strawberry.

53:42.750 --> 53:44.458
I rather doubt if I have the ingredients.

53:44.625 --> 53:47.041
You have a nice glass of water,
Giulio, yes.

53:47.208 --> 53:50.666
My doctor told me never
to drink the water when I am abroad.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.208
Now if you have not milkshake,
I have some practicing to do.

53:54.375 --> 53:55.666
If you will excuse me.

53:56.416 --> 53:58.125
-Ingrid.
-[in Italian] Right away.

54:04.958 --> 54:07.416
[instrumental music]

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
This is Lucille Daumier,
who's also sharing the flat.

54:15.875 --> 54:18.666
Ingrid and Giulio who are also,
sharing the flat.

54:19.083 --> 54:21.083
-[speaking French] <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
-[Ingrid speaking German] <i>Fraulein.</i>

54:21.250 --> 54:24.000
-<i>Monsieur</i>.
-[Giulio in Italian] Just a moment.

54:25.750 --> 54:28.708
-You didn't tell me about them.
-Well I didn't know about them.

54:28.875 --> 54:31.375
-You get rid of them, huh?
-Well I…

54:31.541 --> 54:33.416
[speaking Italian then French]
<i>Signorina, pardon.</i>

54:33.583 --> 54:35.125
[speaking Italian]

54:35.291 --> 54:37.166
Art before all things, no?

54:37.666 --> 54:39.375
Oh I like so much the French women.

54:39.541 --> 54:41.500
Jolly good. And do
the French women like you?

54:41.666 --> 54:42.791
You ask them.

54:42.958 --> 54:45.083
[in French] <i>Mademoiselle, </i>you're gorgeous.

54:45.250 --> 54:47.000
Giulio, please don't be a naughty boy.

54:47.166 --> 54:49.666
-Now Bill tell him, be not naughty.
-She says be not naughty.

54:49.833 --> 54:51.791
-What is naughty?
-[speaking Italian] <i>Malo. No buono</i>.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.791
I am<i> malo</i>? One artist never is<i> malo.</i>

54:53.958 --> 54:55.625
-[speaking French] <i>C'est le métier.</i>
-What's she saying?

54:55.791 --> 54:58.583
-She said that's the way artists are.
-[Ingrid speaking German]

54:58.750 --> 55:01.750
-She's not trying to steal anyone.
-[both speaking French]

55:01.916 --> 55:04.750
Cigar. Who called me a cigar?
You tell her she "don't" call me a cigar.

55:04.916 --> 55:07.250
-She didn't call you a cigar.
-I hear her say cigar.

55:07.666 --> 55:11.458
I said<i> "ce garcon</i>," meaning<i> bambino</i>,
<i>ce garcon</i>, boy. You.

55:11.625 --> 55:14.416
-She called my man a cigar.
-She did not.

55:14.583 --> 55:17.583
-Now I tell you what to call her.
-I don't want to know what to call her.

55:17.750 --> 55:18.833
[speaking French] <i>Ça suffit…</i>

55:19.000 --> 55:22.958
[Lucille and Ingrid argue
in French and German]

55:23.125 --> 55:24.958
Please… I am an artist.

55:25.125 --> 55:27.125
[Giulio speaking Italian]

55:28.458 --> 55:30.166
[Giulio screams]

55:30.750 --> 55:33.625
[Ingrid] Would you please leave now
because Giulio is a great artist,

55:33.791 --> 55:36.333
and he has to work,
in peace and in quietness.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.583
Because he has to practice
for his concert.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.500
-Bill would you tell her to get out!
-Haha.

55:41.333 --> 55:42.375
Bill?

55:51.750 --> 55:52.791
[chatter]

56:00.291 --> 56:02.208
Can I help you? I'm Stella Napier.

56:02.375 --> 56:04.083
Oh, I'm so glad to meet you.

56:04.250 --> 56:07.375
I'm Maggie Shoemaker and these girls
belong to the literary circle,

56:07.541 --> 56:09.500
but they don't know much about modern art,

56:09.666 --> 56:12.291
and I was wondering if you'd tell them
a little about it.

56:12.458 --> 56:15.000
-Certainly, Mrs. Shoemaker.
-Thank you very much.

56:15.166 --> 56:16.791
-Follow me please.
-Go on, girls.

56:16.958 --> 56:19.333
[girls chattering]

56:30.083 --> 56:31.791
-Hi Bill.
-[Bill] Hello Maggie.

56:31.958 --> 56:34.125
There you are.
How is the eternal triangle,

56:34.291 --> 56:36.583
or quadrangle, pentagon,
or whatever it is by now.

56:36.750 --> 56:37.666
Couldn't be worse.

56:37.833 --> 56:40.166
I phoned Stella a dozen times,
now she doesn't answer.

56:40.333 --> 56:41.333
The phone's no good.

56:41.500 --> 56:44.291
The only thing that's worth a damn
is the man, breathing beside you.

56:44.458 --> 56:45.958
I speak from experience.

56:46.541 --> 56:50.291
Come on, this is your chance,
break the ice, break it down.

56:50.458 --> 56:51.750
Break her down.

56:53.375 --> 56:56.083
[Maggie] Ah there she is.
Safely surrounded by my girls.

56:56.250 --> 56:58.666
-Thank you Maggie.
-On your way boy and good luck.

56:59.375 --> 57:00.708
[Lucille] Hello darling.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.916
Oh hello… darling.

57:03.083 --> 57:06.250
Bill I don't seem to have the chance
to talk to you or be with you.

57:06.625 --> 57:09.500
It's so difficult with all these
other people in the flat.

57:09.666 --> 57:11.416
When are we going to be alone again?

57:11.583 --> 57:14.291
-Very soon. I promise.
-I want you all for myself.

57:14.875 --> 57:15.791
So do I.

57:16.916 --> 57:19.416
If you'll just excuse me,
I have someone I must talk to.

57:20.875 --> 57:23.625
-[Stella] Only the cool colours, you see.
-I say, Stella.

57:23.791 --> 57:25.708
Sorry I'm busy. Now if you'll follow me,

57:25.875 --> 57:28.125
I'll show you another example
of this artist's work.

57:28.291 --> 57:31.208
I have never in my life
seen such crazy blues and greens.

57:31.375 --> 57:32.375
Fabulous.

57:33.750 --> 57:34.791
-[Stella] Now--
-[Bill] Stella.

57:34.958 --> 57:37.500
-Can I ask you a question?
-No, you go away.

57:37.666 --> 57:39.958
I don't see how you can object,
if I look at the art.

57:40.125 --> 57:42.333
-Well then look at them.
-Yes ma'am.

57:44.458 --> 57:46.791
I was thinking perhaps
you could take Ingrid out

57:46.958 --> 57:49.916
for dinner this evening
and give her a good time, poor child.

57:50.083 --> 57:50.958
Why poor child?

57:51.125 --> 57:53.833
She sees so little of you,
you're always practicing.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.291
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about Ingrid?

57:56.458 --> 57:58.250
Because I like to see people happy.

57:58.416 --> 58:00.750
Believe me Giulio,
I can tell these things.

58:00.916 --> 58:03.291
Promise me you'll take her tonight,
will you?

58:04.208 --> 58:05.208
All right, I promise.

58:05.375 --> 58:08.750
And you give her a real good time,
dinner, dancing, everything.

58:08.916 --> 58:11.333
[Giulio chuckles] Anything to oblige you.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.583
I like so much Italian men.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.875
And you, what are you going to do
this evening?

58:16.041 --> 58:20.291
I want just a quiet evening at home
and go nice and early to bed.

58:21.791 --> 58:24.750
Now look at the way the herd flows
up and across the canvas.

58:24.916 --> 58:27.166
And the line of the hill,
goes over and down.

58:27.333 --> 58:30.625
Oh he must be terribly sensitive.
I mean the way he's caught those cows.

58:30.791 --> 58:33.875
-There's a contrapuntal effect.
-I think you've got this artist wrong.

58:34.041 --> 58:35.083
He isn't contrapuntal?

58:35.250 --> 58:37.416
No I mean they're not cows. They're bulls.

58:37.583 --> 58:39.458
That is of no importance whatever
to the picture.

58:39.625 --> 58:42.250
-It's of importance to the bulls.
-[girls laughing]

58:42.416 --> 58:44.291
[youth] Here's a drawing
he made of the bull.

58:44.458 --> 58:46.166
Stella, look about Lucille.

58:46.333 --> 58:49.041
I met her ages ago and I gave her
my address out of politeness.

58:49.208 --> 58:51.500
Now she is staying at your flat.
[speaking French] <i>Vive la politesse.</i>

58:51.666 --> 58:54.166
I don't know what you expect me to do
when old friends turn up.

58:54.333 --> 58:55.875
-Anyway, you're out of date.
-Am I?

58:56.041 --> 58:58.291
Yes, another friend's arrived,
someone I met on a walking tour.

58:58.458 --> 58:59.416
How hearty.

58:59.583 --> 59:02.708
Does this friend wear leather shorts
and a shaving brush in his hat?

59:02.875 --> 59:04.916
-Not exactly.
-Billiam, have you seen Giulio?

59:05.083 --> 59:06.750
I promised to meet him
but I'm late as usual.

59:06.916 --> 59:09.916
Yes, he was over there a minute ago,
I think, if you just go…

59:11.875 --> 59:14.000
Miss Ingrid Lein, Miss Napier.

59:14.166 --> 59:15.541
She works in the Art Gallery.

59:15.708 --> 59:17.000
Oh that's very interesting.

59:17.166 --> 59:19.791
I was admiring the picture
of the man with the "pipebags."

59:19.958 --> 59:21.000
Bagpipes.

59:21.166 --> 59:23.000
Would it be possible
to have a reproduction?

59:23.166 --> 59:24.833
Well no, I'm afraid we've sold out.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.166
But if you tell me where you're staying
I can arrange to--

59:27.333 --> 59:28.583
Giulio is over there.

59:28.750 --> 59:30.958
Would you please give her
the number of our apartment, yes?

59:31.375 --> 59:32.541
She knows it.

59:33.208 --> 59:36.000
So much for the leather shorts
and the shaving brush.

59:36.166 --> 59:38.208
Ah miss Napier, there you are.

59:38.583 --> 59:41.625
I want to tell you how much
the girls enjoyed your little lectures.

59:41.791 --> 59:44.041
They're crazy about you
and want to see you again.

59:44.208 --> 59:47.416
And I wondered if you could come to
a reception, I'm giving.

59:47.583 --> 59:49.750
-We'd be honoured if you'd come.
-Well I--

59:49.916 --> 59:52.541
Oh that's just dandy.
It's a date. It's on Saturday.

59:52.708 --> 59:53.875
That's just wonderful.

59:55.208 --> 59:56.750
-But it's just…
-Always you keep me waiting.

59:56.916 --> 59:58.666
But darling, I was just explaining that.

1:00:01.958 --> 1:00:03.875
That girl looks very unhappy, huh?

1:00:06.708 --> 1:00:07.625
Hello.

1:00:08.208 --> 1:00:10.833
-You leaving early too?
-Yes, because I thought you might.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:12.958
Shall we go somewhere and have dinner?

1:00:13.125 --> 1:00:14.708
Why not have something at your place?

1:00:14.875 --> 1:00:17.208
There isn't much except
tins and a few eggs.

1:00:17.375 --> 1:00:18.416
-You have some brandy?
-Yes.

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:21.875
Then I show you what I can do
with a few eggs and some brandy.

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:28.000
You look tired, darling.
Have you had an exhausting day?

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:29.291
I certainly have.

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:33.458
I won't allow you to do anything tonight.

1:00:34.458 --> 1:00:35.458
Nothing at all?

1:00:36.458 --> 1:00:37.583
Nearly nothing.

1:00:43.791 --> 1:00:45.208
Poor, poor Bill.

1:00:45.375 --> 1:00:46.625
Not so poor.

1:00:46.791 --> 1:00:49.416
Music, a nice meal on the stove,
you sitting here.

1:00:49.583 --> 1:00:50.833
[Bill] What more could a man want?

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000
Someone who isn't sitting here.

1:00:55.041 --> 1:00:57.291
It's true, isn't it Bill?

1:00:57.833 --> 1:01:00.291
Lucille, you're not jealous are you?

1:01:00.958 --> 1:01:02.166
Yes, I am.

1:01:03.625 --> 1:01:06.166
You are the first man ever
to make me jealous.

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:07.875
I should be very angry.

1:01:09.166 --> 1:01:10.083
Are you?

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:11.375
Mm-mm.

1:01:13.541 --> 1:01:16.041
I think you are the most wicked man.

1:01:17.958 --> 1:01:19.083
I think so too.

1:01:22.125 --> 1:01:24.333
[soft music]

1:01:42.458 --> 1:01:44.583
[Lucille] But it's boiling over.

1:01:44.750 --> 1:01:45.958
[Bill] That makes two of us.

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:50.166
[Lucille] Bill, I must turn off the gas.

1:01:50.625 --> 1:01:51.666
Please.

1:01:55.541 --> 1:01:56.541
[sizzling]

1:02:06.250 --> 1:02:08.000
[Lucille giggles]

1:02:13.708 --> 1:02:14.958
[dramatic music]

1:02:15.125 --> 1:02:16.208
[knocking]

1:02:17.541 --> 1:02:18.583
Oh blast.

1:02:19.791 --> 1:02:21.000
They'll go away.

1:02:21.916 --> 1:02:23.791
[man] Doesn't seem to be anyone at home.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.708
-Oh we didn't know.
-We thought we just--

1:02:32.875 --> 1:02:34.250
We're frightfully sorry.

1:02:34.958 --> 1:02:37.125
We'll go and telephone you afterwards.

1:02:37.291 --> 1:02:40.000
Wait a moment.
Where on earth did you get that?

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:42.541
Don't you remember,
you sent it across to my table.

1:02:42.708 --> 1:02:44.791
In a peach, in Venice.

1:02:45.541 --> 1:02:46.666
Yes of course.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.708
How is your mother?
I mean, how are your mother and father?

1:02:49.875 --> 1:02:51.083
You do remember.

1:02:51.625 --> 1:02:52.833
Yes, I remember.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.125
It's the most romantic thing
that ever happened to me.

1:02:56.875 --> 1:02:57.791
Yeah.

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.916
-Well, what brings you here?
-We came for the festival.

1:03:02.083 --> 1:03:03.625
[Bill] Didn't you book accommodation?

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:05.375
It's all my fault, honestly.

1:03:05.541 --> 1:03:09.000
You see I persuaded Harry to let me
use the hotel money for a new camera.

1:03:09.166 --> 1:03:12.000
-You know how these things happen.
-Yes, I know.

1:03:12.166 --> 1:03:15.916
-And so, here we are.
-We didn't know that you were, well…

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:19.291
Look Bill, what beautiful flowers.

1:03:19.458 --> 1:03:21.541
May I introduce
mademoiselle Lucille Daumier.

1:03:21.708 --> 1:03:23.083
I am Harry, short for Harriet.

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:25.208
-Perry, ditto for Peregrin.
-[Harry] Reece Peters.

1:03:27.791 --> 1:03:29.750
Well I suppose we ought to be on our way.

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:32.125
I don't know what way,
we haven't got a penny between us.

1:03:32.291 --> 1:03:33.791
Well let me…

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:38.416
Alright, I suppose you'd better come in.

1:03:38.791 --> 1:03:42.166
Don't worry, with a little juggling,
we'll all fit in somehow.

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:44.833
Just one great big, happy family.

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:51.083
Ingrid. What happened?
I thought you and Gu…

1:03:51.250 --> 1:03:53.750
And I thought so too.
Oh that terrible Giulio.

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:57.041
He promised me to take me to dinner and
now he's run off with an English woman.

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:58.625
What English woman?

1:03:58.791 --> 1:04:00.708
-You know, the one you know.
-Stella?

1:04:00.875 --> 1:04:02.791
He went off with Stella?
She must be out of her mind.

1:04:02.958 --> 1:04:05.791
Why must she be out of her mind?
Why can't she go out with Giulio?

1:04:05.958 --> 1:04:07.250
He is a very attractive man.

1:04:07.416 --> 1:04:09.500
She has a perfect right
to go off with Giulio.

1:04:09.666 --> 1:04:11.958
-Yes, of course.
-But he's got no right to go off with her.

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.708
[Ingrid sobbing] Oh he's just a baby.

1:04:15.291 --> 1:04:19.625
He is a big artist,
but with women he is just like a child.

1:04:19.791 --> 1:04:21.625
-[Ingrid cries]
-Let's hope so.

1:04:24.125 --> 1:04:27.125
-[Bill] What are you up to?
-[Lucille] I am working things out.

1:04:27.291 --> 1:04:30.333
-What things?
-How we can all go to bed respectably.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:35.250
-Why respectably?
-Bill, there are children here.

1:04:41.291 --> 1:04:44.750
-[Bill] Any sign of Giulio yet?
-No, but I don't care anymore.

1:04:48.416 --> 1:04:51.750
I do hope you won't let our presence
affect you in any way.

1:04:51.916 --> 1:04:53.000
[Bill] I beg your pardon?

1:04:53.375 --> 1:04:56.208
What I mean is, I realize you
weren't originally intending

1:04:56.375 --> 1:04:58.416
to share a room with me,
if you see what I mean.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:04:59.458
Oh yes.

1:04:59.625 --> 1:05:01.500
I mean if you feel restless

1:05:01.666 --> 1:05:05.041
during the night, you feel like
taking a stroll, as it were.

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.583
As it were.

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:09.458
Yes well one isn't naïve
about these things, is one?

1:05:09.625 --> 1:05:10.875
Of course not.

1:05:11.791 --> 1:05:13.958
Everybody in the kitchen please,
washing up.

1:05:14.125 --> 1:05:16.583
[singing]

1:05:18.375 --> 1:05:19.958
[Giulio singing]

1:05:24.041 --> 1:05:25.541
There you are.

1:05:25.708 --> 1:05:28.333
What's the matter?
Why you start breaking the plates now?

1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:30.416
Because you promise to take me to dinner

1:05:30.583 --> 1:05:33.083
and then you took off with this English
women. that's not very good manner.

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:36.125
It's public relations.
I was making friends for my art.

1:05:36.291 --> 1:05:40.083
I go out with this miss Stella
to a restaurant and we talk about my art.

1:05:40.250 --> 1:05:42.750
-Which restaurant did you go to?
-Oh La Venezia.

1:05:42.916 --> 1:05:44.708
Well wouldn't she just.

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:47.541
You are a naughty, naughty boy.

1:05:47.708 --> 1:05:50.333
-I am natural.
-You are too natural.

1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:53.583
-Oh if you no like it.
-[Ingrid] Who says I don't like it?

1:05:53.750 --> 1:05:54.666
[dramatic music playing]

1:05:54.833 --> 1:05:56.416
Alright, if you like it.

1:05:57.500 --> 1:05:58.833
[upbeat music]

1:06:11.625 --> 1:06:13.708
[upbeat music continues]

1:06:33.333 --> 1:06:34.916
[soft music]

1:06:36.791 --> 1:06:38.583
Goodnight Bill, sleep well.

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:40.375
Goodnight Lucille. You too.

1:06:42.625 --> 1:06:44.958
-Goodnight Perry.
-Goodnight Lucille.

1:06:46.916 --> 1:06:49.666
Bill, how does one
meet someone like Lucille?

1:06:50.125 --> 1:06:52.916
The same way you win at roulette.
By being very, very lucky.

1:06:53.083 --> 1:06:55.166
Goodnight Perry, time you were in bed.

1:06:55.333 --> 1:06:56.875
-You shut up.
-Goodnight Bill.

1:06:57.041 --> 1:06:59.125
Goodnight Harry. Sweet dreams.

1:07:00.666 --> 1:07:02.625
Go on, into bed yourself.

1:07:05.291 --> 1:07:07.958
-Goodnight Billiam.
-Goodnight Ingrid.

1:07:18.083 --> 1:07:19.625
Goodnight Perry.

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:29.541
Bill, I've just discovered
nuclear fission.

1:07:30.541 --> 1:07:32.791
[instrumental music]

1:08:20.958 --> 1:08:22.083
[applause]

1:08:22.250 --> 1:08:24.750
Bravo! Bravo!

1:08:27.958 --> 1:08:29.125
[upbeat music]

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:31.958
Hello. I'm sorry terribly sorry,
we are late

1:08:32.125 --> 1:08:35.291
but Giulio couldn't get away any earlier.
Autograph hunters.

1:08:35.458 --> 1:08:39.416
-Of course, the concert. How did it go?
-Oh "fantastish."

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:41.500
Oh that's wonderful. Many people there?

1:08:42.041 --> 1:08:44.625
Oh it was absolutely overcrowded.

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:46.708
That explains why I couldn't get a seat.

1:08:58.958 --> 1:09:01.500
Were you wanting to say something
to me Mrs. Shoemaker?

1:09:01.666 --> 1:09:03.250
Oh yes, but it's rather private.

1:09:03.416 --> 1:09:06.000
Would you think me terribly rude
if I took Mr. Nairn away

1:09:06.166 --> 1:09:07.666
for just a tiny little minute.

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:08.750
No, not at all.

1:09:08.916 --> 1:09:12.208
Will you take care of Mr. Ferguson for me?
See he doesn't get into trouble.

1:09:12.375 --> 1:09:13.958
-Excuse me.
-Come along Mr. Nairn.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.708
-Well this is a coincidence.
-So unexpected.

1:09:18.875 --> 1:09:19.791
Hi.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:24.541
-Who's the new acquisition?
-New acquisition?

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:28.125
Yes the blonde darling,
with the eyes like two poached eggs.

1:09:28.291 --> 1:09:31.041
She happens to be the daughter
of an old friend of mine.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:34.458
-That's her brother she is dancing with.
-Oh it's her brother is it?

1:09:34.625 --> 1:09:38.000
I thought he might be offspring of yours,
as a result of a youthful affair.

1:09:38.333 --> 1:09:41.583
Oh Stella. If you only knew how much
I've been missing you.

1:09:41.750 --> 1:09:43.833
What a lonely little boy
you must have been.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.666
Let's get out of here,
let's go somewhere we can talk and…

1:09:46.833 --> 1:09:48.958
-And?
-Well you know, talk.

1:09:49.125 --> 1:09:51.625
Tell you what, let's go to the Venezia.

1:09:51.791 --> 1:09:55.666
Oh no, much too crowded.
Tell you what, let's go to your place.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:57.125
Oh no, much too crowded.

1:09:57.291 --> 1:10:00.291
-Oh Bill, I want to go to your place.
-You know as well as I do.

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:02.416
That soon I'll have them
banging on the door.

1:10:02.583 --> 1:10:04.666
Well you can tell them
to bang elsewhere, can't you?

1:10:04.833 --> 1:10:06.500
-Stella, be reasonable.
-Why?

1:10:06.666 --> 1:10:09.166
They're guests of mine.
I can't just turn them on the street.

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:11.458
I don't see why.
It's where they came from, isn't it?

1:10:11.625 --> 1:10:13.750
I'm not going to turn them out
and that's that.

1:10:13.916 --> 1:10:15.625
You obviously prefer
their company to mine.

1:10:16.125 --> 1:10:18.916
Stella. Don't be ridiculous.
In a couple of days, they'll be gone.

1:10:19.083 --> 1:10:21.625
You'll be a lonely boy again,
in search of lonely girls.

1:10:21.791 --> 1:10:24.916
If that's what you think I'm like,
why have you bothered with me?

1:10:25.916 --> 1:10:26.791
I'm going.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:29.208
Stella. Tomorrow, will you spend
the day with me?

1:10:30.166 --> 1:10:32.250
You don't have to make a decision now.

1:10:32.416 --> 1:10:34.666
Just phone me any time
between now and ten in the morning.

1:10:34.833 --> 1:10:36.625
And the whole day is yours, I promise.

1:10:38.291 --> 1:10:40.875
If you don't ring by ten,
we might as well forget we met.

1:10:42.833 --> 1:10:44.500
The decision's yours Stella.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.541
You're not leaving.

1:10:51.625 --> 1:10:54.750
-I am, Mrs. Shoemaker.
-No you're not.

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:56.708
I want to talk to you.

1:10:58.291 --> 1:11:00.958
It's a great mystery to me the effect
you and Bill have on each other.

1:11:01.125 --> 1:11:03.791
Every time I engineer a meeting,
one of you walks out.

1:11:03.958 --> 1:11:07.250
That only proves that we're totally,
well I mean we're not really.

1:11:07.416 --> 1:11:10.041
It proves nothing of the kind.
Only that you love him.

1:11:10.208 --> 1:11:12.541
You're too proud and stubborn
to admit it. Is that true?

1:11:12.708 --> 1:11:13.583
Yes.

1:11:13.750 --> 1:11:17.208
Now why don't you go and ring Bill
and tell him you'll meet him tomorrow?

1:11:17.375 --> 1:11:18.625
Dixie, is that long distance?

1:11:18.791 --> 1:11:20.041
[sobbing] Yes, Mrs. Shoemaker.

1:11:20.208 --> 1:11:22.250
You've talked long enough.
Tell him you love him and ring off.

1:11:22.416 --> 1:11:24.125
Yes Mrs. Shoemaker.

1:11:24.291 --> 1:11:25.833
I hate you!

1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:27.416
That's right.

1:11:27.583 --> 1:11:29.250
Go on now, phone him.

1:11:29.416 --> 1:11:32.250
Do you really think I'm going to
humiliate myself by phoning him?

1:11:32.416 --> 1:11:35.041
-When he's issued an ultimatum.
-But of course, dear.

1:11:35.208 --> 1:11:38.250
Is this how it's supposed
to look Mrs. Shoemaker?

1:11:38.416 --> 1:11:42.750
It's for a man dear, and that isn't
the usual ensemble it's worn with.

1:11:42.916 --> 1:11:45.708
I guess I'll just have to buy
myself a kilt, that's all.

1:11:45.875 --> 1:11:48.416
Now where were we?
Oh yes you were just gonna go phone Bill.

1:11:48.583 --> 1:11:50.375
-No, I wasn't.
-Listen Stella.

1:11:50.541 --> 1:11:53.833
In today's world, when you want a man,
you've got to march in and grab him.

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.208
There was a guy I wanted to marry.

1:11:55.375 --> 1:11:57.416
He was always surrounded
by beautiful girls.

1:11:57.583 --> 1:12:01.000
Secretaries putting flowers on his desk,
everyone spoiling him like crazy.

1:12:01.166 --> 1:12:02.666
You know what I did?

1:12:02.833 --> 1:12:05.750
I went into his office one morning
with the biggest bunch of chrysanthemums

1:12:05.916 --> 1:12:08.041
you have ever seen,
and I said, "Jackson P."

1:12:08.208 --> 1:12:10.541
"If anyone puts flowers
on your desk, it's gotta be me."

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:11.583
And?

1:12:12.125 --> 1:12:14.333
I've been Mrs. Jackson P. Shoemaker
ever since.

1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:17.000
And moral of the story is,
go for what you want.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:20.333
When you want and grab it.
Now are you going to phone Bill?

1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:21.958
I don't know.

1:12:22.125 --> 1:12:25.500
Stella you only have a few hours
to make up your mind, and I warn you.

1:12:25.666 --> 1:12:27.833
I'm coming to your apartment
at ten in the morning,

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.416
if you're still there, I'm going to
wring your pretty little neck.

1:12:32.583 --> 1:12:33.791
[bells]

1:13:02.750 --> 1:13:04.916
[ringing]

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:06.791
Hello.

1:13:07.875 --> 1:13:11.416
Alright, hang on will you. It's for you.

1:13:11.958 --> 1:13:13.333
-For me?
-[Bill] A cable.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.833
Hello. Yes.

1:13:20.291 --> 1:13:22.875
[Lucille] Yes. Thank you.

1:13:23.625 --> 1:13:25.041
[hanging up]

1:13:26.958 --> 1:13:29.083
-[Bill] Come on everybody. Get dressed.
-[Ingrid] Where we going?

1:13:29.250 --> 1:13:32.541
-To the beach, we'll take a picnic.
-[Giulio] I like very much a picnic.

1:13:32.708 --> 1:13:34.250
-Oh that's wonderful.
-[Harry] Super duper.

1:13:34.416 --> 1:13:36.333
In the kitchen
for cutting sandwiches, you.

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:38.000
Perry put the hood down of the Jag?

1:13:38.166 --> 1:13:40.791
Lucille there's beer in the fridge,
and hock in the larder.

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:45.083
[upbeat music]

1:13:51.958 --> 1:13:53.375
Driver. Stop.

1:14:01.666 --> 1:14:03.166
Quickly driver, can you turn round please?

1:14:03.333 --> 1:14:05.458
Of course I can. I've been driving
for 30 years.

1:14:05.625 --> 1:14:06.875
Would you do again please.

1:14:07.041 --> 1:14:10.166
-I'd like to keep up with that Jaguar.
-You would, would you? I see.

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.708
We needn't follow them any more now,
thank you. You've done wonderfully.

1:14:53.875 --> 1:14:56.750
Be walking the rest of the way, will you?
I expect I'll be doing the same.

1:14:56.916 --> 1:14:58.583
Do you remember how nicely
you turned round a while ago?

1:14:58.750 --> 1:14:59.625
Aye.

1:14:59.791 --> 1:15:01.333
Could you try it again, I want to go back.

1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:03.666
That would be an American's idea
of a day at the seaside.

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:05.291
And quickly please, there isn't much time.

1:15:05.458 --> 1:15:07.375
Who do you think I am? Stirling Moss?

1:15:24.875 --> 1:15:26.083
[Ingrid] Hi.

1:15:27.875 --> 1:15:30.125
[Bill] There you are madam.
You'll find that quite comfortable.

1:15:30.291 --> 1:15:32.250
Aren't you going to launch it for me?

1:15:34.041 --> 1:15:37.208
Bill come in, the water is freezing.

1:15:37.375 --> 1:15:40.000
Well knowing you, you'll soon warm it up.
Be there in a minute.

1:15:56.958 --> 1:16:00.041
I know, you turned round so nicely before
you'd like me to do it again.

1:16:00.208 --> 1:16:03.208
As quickly as I can because
there may not be too much time.

1:16:04.750 --> 1:16:07.458
[dramatic music]

1:16:10.250 --> 1:16:12.125
I know I'm doing the wrong thing.

1:16:12.291 --> 1:16:14.375
Right or wrong, you're doing it honey.

1:16:15.625 --> 1:16:18.208
-[Harry] Bill.
-Hello Harry.

1:16:18.375 --> 1:16:20.958
You didn't even notice I was here,
did you?

1:16:21.125 --> 1:16:22.875
-Don't be a goose.
-Don't do that.

1:16:23.041 --> 1:16:25.708
I hate being patted,
makes me feel like a sheepdog.

1:16:25.875 --> 1:16:27.875
Right, it shall never happen again.

1:16:31.208 --> 1:16:32.541
-Bill.
-Harry.

1:16:33.125 --> 1:16:36.000
Have you any idea why you always choose
such unsuitable women?

1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:37.833
[Harry] I mean, take Lucille.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:41.125
Well you can't imagine her ironing shirts,
or cleaning out the grate.

1:16:41.291 --> 1:16:43.750
Or anything, can you? I mean, look at her.

1:16:49.458 --> 1:16:50.958
That's enough.

1:16:51.125 --> 1:16:53.958
And Ingrid,
well Giulio's much more her type.

1:16:54.125 --> 1:16:57.875
They're both completely impulsive people.
You're not impulsive.

1:16:58.041 --> 1:17:01.291
I wouldn't exactly describe myself
as cold blooded.

1:17:01.458 --> 1:17:05.083
I wasn't talking about your blood.
I was talking about your character.

1:17:05.250 --> 1:17:08.250
And I would say, your one impulse
would be for self-preservation.

1:17:08.416 --> 1:17:11.166
In fact I think you're the
most self-preserved man I've ever met.

1:17:11.333 --> 1:17:13.375
I see you've been studying me
quite closely.

1:17:13.541 --> 1:17:16.958
Yes, very, and in my considered opinion,
if you go on postponing things

1:17:17.125 --> 1:17:20.041
very much longer, you're going to
miss the boat altogether.

1:17:27.375 --> 1:17:28.750
You know something, Harry.

1:17:28.916 --> 1:17:33.583
[Bill] You're absolutely right,
it's now or never.

1:17:41.458 --> 1:17:44.125
If I don't take the plunge now,
I never will.

1:17:45.458 --> 1:17:46.416
[jump into water]

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:01.583
It might be quicker, if we'd walked.

1:18:07.625 --> 1:18:09.375
[laughter]

1:18:09.916 --> 1:18:12.000
[Bill] You mustn't leave bait
in the water,

1:18:12.166 --> 1:18:13.791
you're bound to attract sharks.

1:18:13.958 --> 1:18:16.291
You are not a shark, you are a porpoise.

1:18:16.458 --> 1:18:17.958
[Bill] I'm not quite sure I like that.

1:18:18.125 --> 1:18:21.958
Why? It is a very charming thing to be,
a porpoise.

1:18:22.125 --> 1:18:25.458
When you are at sea they swim
alongside your boat for awhile

1:18:25.625 --> 1:18:28.250
and keep you company and then.

1:18:28.416 --> 1:18:31.166
-[Bill] Then what?
-You look around and they are gone.

1:18:32.750 --> 1:18:34.666
[Lucille] Soon I shall be gone.

1:18:35.125 --> 1:18:36.583
But why, why not stay--

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:38.958
Because of the cable
I received this morning.

1:18:39.125 --> 1:18:42.625
It was from Al. He wants me to go
to Rome and marry him.

1:18:42.791 --> 1:18:44.375
He says it's now or never.

1:18:44.541 --> 1:18:48.291
-And, you're not?
-Yes, it's going to be now.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:50.000
-[Bill] Oh no.
-Yes now.

1:18:50.166 --> 1:18:54.000
-Al is a very nice person.
-And he has very nice oil wells.

1:18:54.166 --> 1:18:57.666
Exactly. Don't you agree,
it's a charming combination?

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:59.833
Women certainly are strange creatures.

1:19:00.541 --> 1:19:04.125
Oh and men are not strange at all,
of course.

1:19:04.791 --> 1:19:06.500
Darling do you really expect me

1:19:06.666 --> 1:19:10.000
to stay here and be a substitute
for this Stella of yours?

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:12.916
Am I so strange that
I do not want to do such a thing?

1:19:13.666 --> 1:19:15.666
Why do you think I came here?

1:19:16.375 --> 1:19:19.333
That night in Austria I thought perhaps,

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:23.625
a big perhaps, you were
the answer to everything.

1:19:24.250 --> 1:19:29.625
Someone I could go mad with,
and be sensible and settle down with too.

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:34.291
But that moment is past now.
No Bill, don't pretend, please.

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:37.458
When you part without lies,
you can meet without shame.

1:19:37.958 --> 1:19:39.958
You're a remarkable woman.

1:19:40.833 --> 1:19:44.000
-I'll never forget you, Lucille.
-[Lucille] Of course you will.

1:19:44.458 --> 1:19:48.625
I shall vanish slowly from your memory
like a Cheshire cheese.

1:19:48.791 --> 1:19:51.166
-Cat. Cheshire cat.
-[Lucille] Ugh?

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:53.500
-[Lucille] Oh.
-You've forgotten the rest of the story.

1:19:53.666 --> 1:19:55.291
The smile never vanished.

1:19:56.875 --> 1:19:58.000
Au revoir.

1:20:00.958 --> 1:20:02.083
Cheshire cat.

1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:05.000
Goodbye Cheshire porpoise.

1:20:05.916 --> 1:20:09.125
[soft music]

1:20:22.708 --> 1:20:24.958
It's no use, they could be anywhere.

1:20:25.375 --> 1:20:27.791
[Ingrid] Help, you down there!

1:20:27.958 --> 1:20:30.583
I'm stuck. <i>Ich bin "shtuck."</i>

1:20:31.875 --> 1:20:33.750
Why don't you come and help me?

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.041
What's the trouble?

1:20:35.208 --> 1:20:38.166
I told you, I'm stuck.
Can't you see what's happening?

1:20:39.250 --> 1:20:41.125
Why is it that women can always
do themselves up,

1:20:41.291 --> 1:20:43.791
but they always need help
to get themselves undone.

1:20:44.250 --> 1:20:47.916
One day they'll invent something
you can undo without male assistance.

1:20:48.083 --> 1:20:50.333
Yes but then women won't use it anymore.

1:20:50.500 --> 1:20:51.583
[Bill laughs]

1:20:53.333 --> 1:20:55.125
Thank you, that's fine.

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.875
If I remember rightly something similar
happened on the mountain that night.

1:21:05.041 --> 1:21:06.375
I shouldn't be surprised.

1:21:06.541 --> 1:21:10.583
This kind of thing is always happening
to me and it's so embarrassing.

1:21:21.375 --> 1:21:23.333
I wish we were in that refuge hut now.

1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:24.916
Yes, but we are not.

1:21:25.083 --> 1:21:27.333
You cannot spend
all your life in a refuge.

1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:31.541
Sooner or later, the mist clears
and there the rest of the world.

1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.041
And you just can't ignore it anymore.

1:21:34.208 --> 1:21:37.125
-Much as one would like to.
-No, I don't think so.

1:21:37.291 --> 1:21:39.166
I shan't go back to the mountains.

1:21:39.333 --> 1:21:41.250
Next year I will leave music school
and then I--

1:21:41.416 --> 1:21:46.541
Ingrid. Let's go back just once.
You and I. What do you say?

1:21:47.125 --> 1:21:50.125
No. Once it was spontaneous.

1:21:50.291 --> 1:21:54.791
It can't be twice spontaneous.
Without words and complications.

1:21:54.958 --> 1:21:58.000
No Billiam, I really don't think so.

1:22:02.083 --> 1:22:04.583
[Giulio] Ingrid. Ingrid!

1:22:07.208 --> 1:22:11.041
Ah! There you are. I'm looking for you.

1:22:11.833 --> 1:22:13.125
What a pretty face!

1:22:13.291 --> 1:22:14.250
Isolda herself.

1:22:14.416 --> 1:22:16.000
Well I don't know what to call you,
Giulio.

1:22:16.166 --> 1:22:18.041
You're not the Tristan type, are you?

1:22:18.208 --> 1:22:19.791
-Maybe.
-[Bill] Casanova.

1:22:19.958 --> 1:22:22.208
I am Casanova. You are Casanova, not me.

1:22:22.375 --> 1:22:24.708
While I am taking a siesta,
you take Ingrid into grass

1:22:24.875 --> 1:22:27.208
for a bit of hanky and a bit of the panky,
no? Come Ingrid.

1:22:27.375 --> 1:22:29.333
What about you marching off
with Stella the other night?

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.166
-What've you got to say about that?
-I say<i> niente</i>.

1:22:31.333 --> 1:22:34.541
You have no right to talk Stella. You have
rights only when you make woman happy.

1:22:34.708 --> 1:22:37.250
Is not true,<i> bella mia?</i>
You make Stella unhappy.

1:22:37.416 --> 1:22:39.583
You have not right.
You don't intend to marry her.

1:22:39.750 --> 1:22:42.875
What right have you over Ingrid?
You don't intend to marry her, do you?

1:22:44.250 --> 1:22:45.250
Yes, I marry her.

1:22:45.833 --> 1:22:48.166
You do. Does he?

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.375
Maestro. Maestro.

1:22:52.416 --> 1:22:57.000
<i>-</i>[speaking Italian] <i>"Allegro"…</i>
<i>-</i>[speaking Italian] <i>"Ma non troppo."</i>

1:22:59.416 --> 1:23:00.833
[in Italian] Good luck!

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:02.708
[Stella] We'll never find them.

1:23:02.875 --> 1:23:06.125
We've got another 20 miles of beach
to cover before sundown, come on.

1:23:06.583 --> 1:23:09.500
Well I said Ingrid and Giulio
are both the impulsive types

1:23:09.666 --> 1:23:11.958
and they impulsed. I'm not surprised.

1:23:12.125 --> 1:23:13.208
So I gathered.

1:23:13.375 --> 1:23:15.666
What other bright forecasts
have you got up your sleeve?

1:23:15.833 --> 1:23:19.333
For one, you'll frizzle up like a potato,
if you don't put this on your back.

1:23:19.500 --> 1:23:20.416
I'm perfectly alright.

1:23:20.583 --> 1:23:22.750
You're perfectly all wrong
as a matter of fact.

1:23:22.916 --> 1:23:24.125
Not that you can see it.

1:23:24.291 --> 1:23:26.375
You've been perfectly all wrong,
all along.

1:23:26.541 --> 1:23:27.416
In what way?

1:23:27.583 --> 1:23:29.416
Because you can't see
what's staring you in the face.

1:23:29.583 --> 1:23:32.458
-[Bill] And what is?
-[Harry] That I love you.

1:23:32.625 --> 1:23:33.875
-Harry!
-I do.

1:23:34.041 --> 1:23:36.750
-But you don't know anything about love.
-I know. Isn't it wonderful?

1:23:36.916 --> 1:23:38.291
You can teach me everything.

1:23:38.458 --> 1:23:41.583
Oh Bill, I think this is
the most wonderful day of my life.

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.083
There they are. Alright baby.

1:23:45.250 --> 1:23:47.125
This is where
the booster rocket falls away.

1:23:47.291 --> 1:23:49.291
From now on in, you're on your own.

1:23:51.041 --> 1:23:53.708
I'm just exactly what you need, Bill.
Honestly aren't I?

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:56.208
-And I'm not bad to look at, am I?
-No. Not bad.

1:23:56.375 --> 1:23:57.666
Well there you are, see?

1:23:57.833 --> 1:24:00.708
And what's more, I'm available,
very available.

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.125
And very, very sweet.

1:24:03.291 --> 1:24:05.416
Then you agree?
You will? You will marry me?

1:24:05.583 --> 1:24:08.375
Oh Bill, it'll be fun.
Such wonderful, wonderful fun.

1:24:08.541 --> 1:24:11.541
-I'm so excited, so terribly excited.
-[Bill] Now Harry!

1:24:11.708 --> 1:24:14.916
[Harry] Everyone! Ingrid, Giulio, Lucille.

1:24:15.083 --> 1:24:17.375
Bill and I are engaged.
Isn't it wonderful?

1:24:17.541 --> 1:24:20.458
We're engaged. Perry, we're engaged.

1:24:24.458 --> 1:24:26.041
[dramatic music]

1:24:27.666 --> 1:24:29.041
[Bill] Stella.

1:24:30.416 --> 1:24:33.291
I must ask you to excuse me.
I'll explain later, please.

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.208
Stella. Stella.

1:24:39.375 --> 1:24:40.583
[Bill] Stella!

1:25:15.166 --> 1:25:18.125
[policeman] Hey! You're not allowed aboard
public transport improperly dressed--

1:25:18.291 --> 1:25:20.625
-Stella! Get off. Come on, get off!
-Go away.

1:25:20.791 --> 1:25:22.708
-He's pestering the lady now.
-Hey. You.

1:25:22.875 --> 1:25:24.208
Get off, or I'll drag you off.

1:25:24.375 --> 1:25:27.083
[man] Do you not know better than to get
on a bus like that on a Sabbath.

1:25:27.250 --> 1:25:29.541
-Alright!
-[Stella screams] Bill!

1:25:29.708 --> 1:25:31.666
-[Stella screams]
-[whistle]

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:35.041
You're not going to kidnap a lady
off my bus, not while I'm in charge.

1:25:35.208 --> 1:25:37.791
It's for her own good. She got away
from an institution up the road.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:39.916
[Stella] It's not, it's not true.

1:25:40.541 --> 1:25:42.291
No don't believe him, it's not true.

1:25:45.291 --> 1:25:49.041
[Stella shouting]

1:25:49.208 --> 1:25:52.583
Now, now now. It's alright everybody.
Everything's in order.

1:25:52.750 --> 1:25:55.375
The poor lassie escaped
from a home up the road.

1:25:55.541 --> 1:25:58.666
-He'll be her doctor no doubt.
-There's no home up the road.

1:25:58.833 --> 1:25:59.791
Is there not, now?

1:25:59.958 --> 1:26:02.458
Would a doctor in charge of patients,
be dressed like that?

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:05.416
Now you come to mention it.
I doubt very much if he would…

1:26:06.625 --> 1:26:07.791
[Stella shouts]

1:26:07.958 --> 1:26:09.500
[dramatic music]

1:26:14.708 --> 1:26:18.666
[Stella screams]

1:26:21.458 --> 1:26:23.041
[dramatic music intensifies]

1:26:28.750 --> 1:26:29.708
[tires screeching]

1:26:38.791 --> 1:26:42.375
-Bill. Bill, will you let me out?
-No.

1:26:42.958 --> 1:26:45.083
You're engaged. You're engaged
to that drippy girl.

1:26:45.250 --> 1:26:47.208
-I'm not, I'm engaged to you.
-[Stella] But she said.

1:26:47.375 --> 1:26:49.250
I don't care what she said.
I've broken it off.

1:26:49.416 --> 1:26:52.333
I'm engaged to you and we're going
to be married by special license.

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.375
We're going to Rome, Venice, Paris
and Positano for our honeymoon.

1:26:55.541 --> 1:26:57.666
-But you…
-And we're going to have four children.

1:27:01.916 --> 1:27:04.083
You're the most conceited person
I've ever known.

1:27:04.250 --> 1:27:05.875
You think when you're tired of your harem,

1:27:06.041 --> 1:27:08.541
I'll be there, ready and waiting.
Well I'm not.

1:27:08.708 --> 1:27:12.666
Flowers, I want bunches of flowers and
boxes of chocolates and expensive dinners

1:27:12.833 --> 1:27:14.875
to make up for the monstrous way
you've behaved.

1:27:15.041 --> 1:27:17.833
You've had that. I've run you home.
Kissed you on the doorstep.

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.625
I've remembered your birthday.
Been polite to your mother.

1:27:20.791 --> 1:27:22.041
Now we're here, this is it.

1:27:23.291 --> 1:27:24.291
-[Stella] Bill.
-Yes.

1:27:24.458 --> 1:27:26.541
Sure we shouldn't take
one more look in the bathroom?

1:27:26.708 --> 1:27:27.750
Quite sure.
