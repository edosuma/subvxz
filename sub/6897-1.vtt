Daily Sentinel, one moment please.

00:52.916 --> 00:56.198
The mayor doesn't want the article on gas
prices go to print.

00:58.065 --> 01:00.499
Tell the Mayor, I'm insulted.

01:00.846 --> 01:04.488
I would never jeopardize the journalistic integrity
of this newspaper,

01:04.489 --> 01:07.014
for some rent-a-mayor's political agenda.

01:07.015 --> 01:08.321
Very well Mr. ...

01:11.715 --> 01:13.320
So, Britt.

01:15.198 --> 01:16.589
Here we are again.

01:17.172 --> 01:20.170
Sent home after another school yard fight.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.834
I know you miss your mother.

01:23.456 --> 01:24.532
So do I.

01:26.343 --> 01:30.068
But I have to take care of 750 employees,

01:30.069 --> 01:32.063
and you have to take care of yourself.

01:33.234 --> 01:37.231
Still that seems to be asking....to much.

01:37.705 --> 01:39.678
I was trying to stop some bullies...

01:39.679 --> 01:42.575
Trying doesn't matter when you always fail.

01:45.225 --> 01:46.373
No, Dad!

01:51.457 --> 01:53.431
Do you think it makes me happy to do this?

01:53.597 --> 01:55.425
-YES!
-No it doesn't.

01:56.009 --> 01:58.950
There's not a week goes by when you find
yourself in some kind of trouble.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.809
But if you're doing this for attention,

02:01.810 --> 02:03.875
you have all that I can afford to give you.

02:04.109 --> 02:06.125
And you're wasting my time.

02:13.365 --> 02:15.400
20 years later...

02:45.479 --> 02:47.051
No, no, not you.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.500
Have a seat.

02:59.658 --> 03:01.896
Either one, they're both very comfortable.

03:08.624 --> 03:09.976
So what can I do for you?

03:09.978 --> 03:14.475
As you know, I have worked my entire
life, very hard...

03:14.476 --> 03:15.936
to achieve one goal.

03:15.937 --> 03:20.258
-Well.
-And that goal, which I have in fact, achieved.

03:20.884 --> 03:25.008
Was to be in charge of all the crime,
in the city of Los Angeles.

03:25.970 --> 03:31.308
Therefore, the fact that you assume that
you can open this establishment,

03:31.309 --> 03:32.843
without my permission.

03:32.844 --> 03:35.254
without payment, and sell narcotics out of it.

03:35.255 --> 03:36.871
Is completely unacceptable.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.216
Really?

03:38.217 --> 03:41.186
And to be honest.
Quite insulting.

03:42.296 --> 03:46.127
Therefore, you must sign up ownership of this
establishment to me.

03:46.441 --> 03:48.848
For which time you become my employees.

03:48.849 --> 03:50.395
What, we're...we're your employees?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.066
Yeah, or close down permanently.

03:53.718 --> 03:55.065
The choice is yours.

03:55.066 --> 03:56.917
Okay, uh, how do I pronounce your name?

03:57.504 --> 03:59.453
Ch...Tchaikovsky.

03:59.454 --> 04:00.619
Chudnofsky.

04:00.620 --> 04:03.816
Char...chadost...chod dosky.

04:06.957 --> 04:10.940
Chud...nof...sky.

04:10.945 --> 04:12.561
Chudnofsky.

04:12.973 --> 04:14.979
All right, Chudnofsky.

04:14.985 --> 04:16.036
Kiss my ass.

04:17.272 --> 04:19.423
Put your lips to my ass,

04:19.868 --> 04:20.913
and kiss it.

04:20.914 --> 04:21.952
French kiss it.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.854
Tickle it with your grey whiskers.

04:24.642 --> 04:26.746
I got bitter sweet news for you.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.378
You're washed up.

04:28.712 --> 04:31.416
You're old, you're boring, you're not scary.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.152
You dress like shit.

04:33.449 --> 04:36.332
It's over for you, okay.
That's the bitter news.

04:36.738 --> 04:38.440
Now the sweet news is,

04:38.441 --> 04:39.772
you can retire.

04:40.349 --> 04:41.816
You can go play golf.

04:42.208 --> 04:45.442
Eat your dinners at 3 O'clock in the afternoon.

04:46.132 --> 04:48.613
Play with your grandkids, drink Metamucil.

04:49.268 --> 04:50.336
Old people shit.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.639
Okay, look at me.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.966
I got a name people can say.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.499
My name is Danny Clear.

04:58.277 --> 04:59.573
I deal crystal meth.

05:00.411 --> 05:02.185
People call me, crystal-clear.

05:02.186 --> 05:03.299
It's easy.

05:03.967 --> 05:06.015
Check out my kick-ass hangout here.

05:06.094 --> 05:08.488
I got pillars of glass everywhere.

05:08.812 --> 05:10.349
I got a see-through piano.

05:10.945 --> 05:12.338
Look at my boys.

05:13.077 --> 05:14.370
They're pimped out.

05:14.628 --> 05:18.215
We got Gucci, Armani, another Gucci.

05:18.387 --> 05:19.829
Tailor made.

05:21.285 --> 05:24.350
This is what you need to get to the top, today.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.299
Not hard work.

05:26.391 --> 05:28.569
Not dressing like disco-Santa-Claus.

05:29.136 --> 05:30.472
You need charisma.

05:30.881 --> 05:32.473
You look like my Uncle Gregg.

05:33.237 --> 05:36.244
Very nice guy, but, he's a dentist.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.821
Now consider this your retirement letter.

05:41.086 --> 05:42.086
Boom!

05:42.820 --> 05:43.820
It's over.

05:45.122 --> 05:46.701
See your way out.

05:50.328 --> 05:52.732
Well you truly don't think I'm scary?

05:54.422 --> 05:55.775
Nah, no.

05:59.230 --> 06:02.321
Okay, o...kay, you're scary!

06:02.915 --> 06:04.017
Yeah, you're scary.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.053
You just said I'm not.

06:05.054 --> 06:06.519
No, no you are. You are.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.412
What's a Disco-Santa?

06:08.415 --> 06:11.643
Disco-Santa, I don't know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:11.644 --> 06:13.179
It was just something stupid to say.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.504
You said I'm boring too.
My gun has two barrels.

06:16.505 --> 06:17.793
That's not boring.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.641
But is was very difficult to make.

06:21.637 --> 06:23.582
-Answer me!
-What?

06:25.310 --> 06:27.367
Well what can I do to be more scary?

06:27.368 --> 06:29.944
A better name?
A cooler name?

06:29.945 --> 06:31.420
A little more color, or something.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.153
Ah, um....

06:33.154 --> 06:36.855
May...maybe, maybe you could say something
to people before you kill them.

06:36.856 --> 06:40.749
But not now. It's hard to think with
this double barrel in my face.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.848
Sorry.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.913
You've given me a lot to think about.

06:54.066 --> 06:55.375
You're not going to kill me?

06:55.934 --> 06:59.501
Okay I get it. You keep me alive so I
can, I can spread your legend.

06:59.832 --> 07:01.481
Okay, I'll do that, man.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.294
I'll spread your legend.

07:04.089 --> 07:05.681
And you forgot your briefcase.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
(High pitched beep)

07:35.913 --> 07:37.587
Let's get this party crazy.

07:37.933 --> 07:41.601
<i>*Rolling Stones: Live with me*</i>

07:42.034 --> 07:44.322
<i>*I got nasty habits, *</i>

07:45.562 --> 07:47.973
<i>*I take tea at three*</i>

07:47.974 --> 07:51.471
<i>*Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner time*</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:54.950
<i>*Must be, hung up for a week*</i>

07:56.484 --> 08:03.241
<i>*My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese*</i>

08:04.398 --> 08:10.747
<i>*Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?*</i>

08:11.972 --> 08:16.315
<i>*Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three*</i>

08:19.119 --> 08:20.803
<i>*Come on now, honey,*</i>

08:20.804 --> 08:23.510
<i>*Don't you wanna live with me?*
-Behold my lady.</i>

08:25.634 --> 08:29.729
<i>*And there's a score of harebrained children*</i>

08:29.730 --> 08:32.650
<i>*They're all locked in the nursery*</i>

08:32.980 --> 08:36.871

08:36.871 --> 08:40.150
<i>*They're so 20th century*</i>

08:40.333 --> 08:43.856
<i>*Well they queue up for the bathroom*</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:47.794
*At around about 7:35*

08:48.812 --> 08:55.241
*Don'cha think we need a woman's
touch to make it come alive?*

08:55.242 --> 09:00.698
*You'd look good pram pushing
Down the high street*

09:17.378 --> 09:18.378
Mmmmm.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.431
That's the good stuff.

09:29.014 --> 09:30.508
Good morning.

09:30.509 --> 09:34.107
-Alll..real
-Ana Lee.

09:34.108 --> 09:36.090
Ana Lee, that's what I meant.

09:38.005 --> 09:39.247
Oh shit.

09:41.889 --> 09:45.618
Son, this what you want from your life?

09:48.351 --> 09:52.507
This, uh. This gives you a sense of fulfillment?

09:53.222 --> 09:55.340
Dad, I told you tomorrow,

09:55.341 --> 09:58.137
I'm enrolling in I.T.T. Technical Institute.

09:58.138 --> 10:00.881
I am going to fix computers for a living, so...

10:02.737 --> 10:07.678
I spend all night writing an editorial about
the nausea this town has come to inspirer.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.484
About the corruption, the violence,
and the decadence

10:11.485 --> 10:13.719
that we've come to expect as part
of our daily life.

10:14.704 --> 10:17.335
Then I have to turn the page...

10:18.197 --> 10:22.130
and see my own son's
contribution to this mayhem.

10:24.774 --> 10:27.208
Sweet, I'm on the paper.

10:27.552 --> 10:29.720
Now you may think you're humiliating me.

10:29.894 --> 10:32.204
-Oy.
-You're humiliating yourself.

10:32.457 --> 10:35.253
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, if you don't like it, why
don't you ask them not to print it.

10:35.254 --> 10:36.543
It's your newspaper.

10:36.544 --> 10:38.709
I can't because unfortunately it's news.

10:40.126 --> 10:43.781
I've kept myself out the papers for years,
now do me a favor and do the same.

10:44.517 --> 10:48.720
And I told you, stop taking girls into my garage.

10:49.805 --> 10:52.531
You do it again, I'll change the lock.

10:54.745 --> 10:58.402
-Okay, but can you sign this for me?
-Yeah.

11:00.387 --> 11:04.874
Never...stop...the party.

11:22.894 --> 11:27.474
<i>*Digital Underground: The Humpty Dance

11:27.475 --> 11:30.424
<i>*so yo world I hope you're ready for me.

11:30.425 --> 11:34.179
<i>*I'm the new fool in town

11:41.547 --> 11:48.663
Go, go, go, go.

11:48.663 --> 11:53.537
Hello.
Get it, get the shot, get it.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.176
How are you coping with your father's death?

11:58.449 --> 12:00.022
If you're just joining us,

12:00.023 --> 12:03.839
James Reid has been found dead from
an allergic reaction to a bee sting.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.784
Leaving his son, his empire.

12:11.850 --> 12:17.173
<i>*Johnny Cash: I hung my head

To practice my aim.*</i>

-It was during my election campaign.

12:34.705 --> 12:37.293
*...hung my head, I hung my head.*
-Running for district attorney
when I first met James Reid.

12:37.582 --> 12:42.436
It was immediately clear to me that he was a
man of infallible integrity.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.179
He dedicated himself to this city,

12:45.180 --> 12:49.057
though his philanthropic endeavors and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel.

12:49.617 --> 12:51.745
A shinning beacon of truth.

12:52.737 --> 12:54.057
He was our north star.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.283
He showed us the way.

12:58.148 --> 12:59.397
Thank you James.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.603
Britt, your father was truly a great man.

13:16.604 --> 13:19.111
-When I first started campaigning...
-Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:19.112 --> 13:21.443
-He was the best business man I've ever known.
-Yep.

13:21.444 --> 13:23.276
-He always came out on top.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:23.860 --> 13:24.860
Britt?

13:27.283 --> 13:29.490
Britt, hey.

13:29.770 --> 13:31.222
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.832
I just want to say that,

13:33.498 --> 13:37.123
my father was a federal court judge.
So I think I kinda know how it feels.

13:37.825 --> 13:39.567
When he passed away, I uh,

13:39.568 --> 13:41.547
had some pretty big shoes to fill.

13:41.548 --> 13:42.671
Just like you.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.056
So if you ever need somebody to talk to.

13:46.461 --> 13:48.909
I mean, if you ever just want
to grab a drink.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.050
Want to get cheered up.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.097
I'm around.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.635
Okay, thanks man I really appreciate it.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.506
-Yeah, lock it up....keep it tight.
-Yeah, okay.... Cool.

14:11.862 --> 14:13.200
This is your newspaper.

14:15.149 --> 14:18.282
Look, the burden doesn't have to
fall on you alone.

14:25.209 --> 14:28.492
I've been with your father since I was just
in college for the past forty five years.

14:30.218 --> 14:33.075
I'm going to make sure the Daily Sentinel
stays on the path.

14:33.076 --> 14:34.402
It would make him proud.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.487
So what do you think of all this?

14:45.186 --> 14:47.053
I don't think anything, man.

14:48.097 --> 14:50.051
I don't know a thing about this newspaper.

14:50.052 --> 14:53.711
I've never really read a full edition of it.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.472
You can do whatever the hell you want with it.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.255
I'm not the guy to run The Sentinel.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.861
Trying means a man will always fail.

15:22.232 --> 15:23.336
Oh.

15:24.109 --> 15:25.725
Where's my leaf?

15:35.438 --> 15:36.885
Stupid bush!

15:42.146 --> 15:43.146
Hello!

15:43.150 --> 15:45.025
Who makes my coffee?

15:44.670 --> 15:46.749
WHO makes my coffee?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.913
Will someone explain to me,

15:48.914 --> 15:50.680
why the worst day in my life?

15:50.681 --> 15:52.479
My coffee tastes like shit.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.207
You...your coffee is normally made by, Kato.

15:55.443 --> 15:57.147
Who the hell is that?

15:57.384 --> 16:00.575
He works on your father's cars,
and makes his coffee.

16:00.576 --> 16:03.621
You fired him, and everyone else who works
for your father yesterday.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.270
I want Kato here, NOW!

16:20.948 --> 16:22.357
You're, Kato.

16:23.225 --> 16:26.301
Man I thought your name was Henry.
I thought the pool guy was, Kato.

16:26.302 --> 16:27.309
I'm Kato.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.197
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

16:31.936 --> 16:32.735
He was a...

16:33.379 --> 16:34.466
complex man.

16:37.509 --> 16:38.509
Yep.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.106
I've two questions for you, Kato.

16:41.107 --> 16:42.491
Then you can go home.

16:43.186 --> 16:45.703
Why is it my dad's mechanic makes the coffee?

16:45.704 --> 16:48.852
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes like crap?

16:49.181 --> 16:51.267
I think it's easier if I show you.

16:54.026 --> 16:56.604
Holy cow. Where did you get that thing?

16:56.605 --> 16:57.644
I made it.

16:58.233 --> 17:00.556
-Watch this.
-Unbelievable.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.891
You sit with me, Kato.

17:44.186 --> 17:45.484
Tell me your tale.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.145
I was born in Shanghai.

17:47.426 --> 17:48.425
You know, Shanghai?

17:48.426 --> 17:49.867
Mmm, loved Japan.

17:49.870 --> 17:51.743
My parents died when I was four.

17:52.595 --> 17:54.411
And Auntie when I was twelve.

17:55.003 --> 17:56.729
I lived in an orphanage.

17:57.498 --> 17:59.825
Sorry, my mom died when I was young, too.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.097
What uh, what happened after that?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.650
I made a few friends, ran away.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.821
I lived on the street.

18:07.822 --> 18:09.672
How did you start working for my Dad.
Tell me that.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.842
I was working in a garage.

18:10.843 --> 18:14.266
-Okay.
-And one day your father came in with a six-five Chrysler.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.547
I know the car well.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.201
He was so happy with my work.

18:17.929 --> 18:19.769
Then  he offered me a job.

18:20.037 --> 18:23.430
-I said, yes.
-The coffee, how did that come about?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.677
He used to always say,

18:25.784 --> 18:29.048
"No one could ever make me,
a good cup of coffee".

18:29.049 --> 18:30.113
Good impression.

18:30.114 --> 18:32.067
So I build him the coffee machine.

18:33.459 --> 18:36.117
Well you make one damn fine cup
of coffee, sir.

18:36.302 --> 18:37.867
Want to see something cool?

18:39.247 --> 18:40.247
Yeah.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.674
Not bad, man.

18:46.267 --> 18:47.718
-You did this?
-Yeah.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.359
Industrial polycarbonate.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.941
What the hell is "Industrial polycarbonate"?

18:54.728 --> 18:57.700
It's the stuff they use to make shark tanks.

18:57.982 --> 19:00.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing man?

19:00.091 --> 19:01.481
Put that thing away, are you crazy?

19:01.777 --> 19:03.823
Come on, don't be a pussy.

19:07.559 --> 19:08.769
What are  you going to do?

19:12.088 --> 19:14.561
Oh, dude!

19:15.394 --> 19:17.405
That was awesome. What is that stuff?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.269
How does that wor...oh, what
are you going to do now?

19:20.031 --> 19:23.297
-And...
-Whoa!

19:24.090 --> 19:26.197
That is some bad hard shit, dude.

19:26.526 --> 19:30.557
Yep. Your dad made me do this kind of
stuff over the last few years.

19:33.237 --> 19:35.010
That is the balls.

19:38.703 --> 19:41.008
The old man was getting paranoid, huh?

19:41.368 --> 19:42.648
-You like that?
-Yeah.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.904
Check this out.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.781
You drew all these?

19:54.220 --> 19:55.610
This is awesome.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.793
Kato, you a really good drawer.

19:58.794 --> 20:00.042
This is really impressive.

20:00.263 --> 20:02.896
Thanks. That's the stuff I would
really like to do.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.235
Holy!

20:04.236 --> 20:05.749
Kato, are you a pervert?

20:07.294 --> 20:09.570
'Course I could draw stuff like that sexy.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.462
-Beer?
-Yeah, I'd love a beer, sure.

20:28.364 --> 20:29.364
Thank you.

20:37.564 --> 20:38.913
Hey, Kato.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.837
What did you think of my father?

20:42.352 --> 20:43.680
Was fine.

20:44.804 --> 20:47.045
Come on, just tell me.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.335
He was my boss.

20:48.336 --> 20:50.044
Nobody loves their boss.

20:50.285 --> 20:53.001
Don't sugar coat this, Kato.
You're not going to offend me.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.305
Just tell me.

20:54.502 --> 20:55.562
Man to man.

20:56.815 --> 20:58.322
He was a bit of a dick.

21:01.329 --> 21:02.329
Yep.

21:05.948 --> 21:09.334
You are...look at that.

21:09.740 --> 21:11.952
I am, a genius.

21:11.953 --> 21:13.076
You are a genius.

21:13.077 --> 21:15.059
You're a mad genius.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.127
I like classical music.

21:17.128 --> 21:19.054
You're a genius who likes classical music.

21:19.055 --> 21:21.844
You know what you are? You're a
human Swiss army knife.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.720
I don't know what that mean.

21:23.721 --> 21:25.615
It's a little thing that you keep pulling out things.

21:25.616 --> 21:27.677
And just when you think there couldn't be anymore...

21:27.678 --> 21:31.893
cool things, a new cool things come out. And
that's you. You even are dressed like one.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.518
You could put a little plus on your chest.

21:33.519 --> 21:35.460
-Let's drink more.
-Yeah, let's drink.

21:36.294 --> 21:39.026
-Gam Bei. (Cheers)
-Gam Bei, yeah.

21:39.027 --> 21:41.092
(Speaking Chinese)

21:41.093 --> 21:42.317
You're speaking Chinese right now.

21:42.318 --> 21:44.213
Oh, shit sorry.

21:44.432 --> 21:48.360
I spend three weeks making new bumper
for his Rolls Royce.

21:48.361 --> 21:52.048
And the day after I finished, he crashed it.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.570
He actually saying it was my fault.

21:55.221 --> 21:56.528
He swing at me.

21:57.092 --> 21:58.511
That sounds like him.

21:58.857 --> 22:01.779
Let's investigate another story
of the ten million I have.

22:02.533 --> 22:03.740
I'm young.

22:04.603 --> 22:08.250
Guys are picking on a girl at school, I try to stop it.

22:08.251 --> 22:09.255
I get in trouble.

22:09.634 --> 22:12.354
What does my dad do? He takes my favorite toy.

22:12.355 --> 22:14.903
And he rips the head off of it, right
in front of me.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.302
And he throws it in the garbage.

22:16.303 --> 22:18.818
I was trying to help. That's
all I was trying to do.

22:19.608 --> 22:21.155
You know, it's unbelievable.

22:21.156 --> 22:22.155
He...

22:22.499 --> 22:25.700
He's an ass his entire life. And you know, they...

22:25.701 --> 22:28.319
they built him a statue. I just don't think...

22:28.565 --> 22:32.320
people are going to look at it and
think he's great but he's not.

22:32.321 --> 22:34.758
It's, it's totally unfair.

22:35.532 --> 22:37.018
There's no justice.

22:41.070 --> 22:42.731
-Well, Kato.
-Hmm.

22:43.292 --> 22:46.573
What do you say we get ourselves
some godamn justice, huh?

22:47.284 --> 22:49.345
-You serious?
-Totally serious.

22:49.346 --> 22:50.752
Let's do something crazy man.

22:50.753 --> 22:51.933
Let's just do something nuts!

22:52.054 --> 22:53.343
-Okay.
-Lets just do it.

22:53.344 --> 22:54.693
-Okay.
-Yeah.

23:03.988 --> 23:05.361
Let's roll, Kato.

23:19.371 --> 23:21.804
You think it makes me happy to do this, Dad?

23:35.544 --> 23:36.544
Come here.

23:47.005 --> 23:48.519
Oh, this looks ominous.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.739
Ah shit, oh no.

24:09.943 --> 24:11.579
What will I do? What will I do?

24:11.814 --> 24:12.944
Okay.

24:14.845 --> 24:16.807
HEY! Leave them alone.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.850
Let's get him.

24:19.017 --> 24:20.333
Oh shit!

24:20.334 --> 24:21.473
I made a mistake.

24:26.786 --> 24:27.786
Shit!

24:29.892 --> 24:31.946
Hey, ha' .. was a set up.

24:39.456 --> 24:41.201
Okay, okay, no!

24:41.202 --> 24:42.810
I'm going to give him a root canal.

24:42.811 --> 24:44.069
-I don't want one.
-Just cut him.

24:47.189 --> 24:48.712
Open wi...

24:51.248 --> 24:53.051
-You're a dead man.
-Come on, lets go.

25:33.936 --> 25:35.294
Britt, behind you.

25:42.804 --> 25:43.804
Eat shit.

25:47.878 --> 25:49.133
Get rid of it.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.190
Wait. Wait for me, wait.

25:58.509 --> 25:59.994
Go, go, go, go.
I'm in, I'm in.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.105
Kato, that was crazy.

26:04.106 --> 26:05.303
That's unbelievable.

26:05.304 --> 26:06.800
Holy shit.

26:06.801 --> 26:08.440
Oh my god, Kato.

26:16.525 --> 26:17.997
Shit, Britt.

26:18.191 --> 26:19.926
Oh no, oh no.

26:19.927 --> 26:20.946
Are you a good driver?

26:21.840 --> 26:23.086
Are you kidding me.

26:23.087 --> 26:24.983
When I was a kid, we had some...

26:24.984 --> 26:27.389
-Kato, not now, just drive.
-Okay, okay.

26:32.803 --> 26:34.677
-Just stay cool.
-What will I do?

26:34.678 --> 26:35.749
Just act casual.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.050
Pull it over, now!

26:39.085 --> 26:40.085
What you doing?

26:40.085 --> 26:41.595
I'm trying to loose him.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.862
Aw man there he comes.

26:44.939 --> 26:46.112
Here he comes.

26:50.983 --> 26:52.067
Show me your hands.

26:59.523 --> 27:00.955
He tried to kill us.

27:01.306 --> 27:02.788
We're the bad guys, shit.

27:04.027 --> 27:05.547
We're really in a fix.

27:16.758 --> 27:17.758
Oh, no.

27:25.418 --> 27:27.460
Oh, damn it.

27:29.561 --> 27:30.561
Kato,...

27:31.472 --> 27:33.878
I think this is the greatest moment of my entire life.

27:34.564 --> 27:36.434
I know. Mine too.

27:56.206 --> 27:58.381
We are good.

27:58.382 --> 28:00.816
That was crazy. How did you do that dude?

28:00.817 --> 28:02.892
You beat the crap out of those guys.

28:02.893 --> 28:05.018
Where I grew up, it was very dangerous.

28:05.326 --> 28:08.283
I got to learn to fight when I was just a kid.

28:08.284 --> 28:10.911
That was like, you knew where people were
without even looking.

28:10.912 --> 28:13.408
-You were so fast.
-My heart starts pumping.

28:13.409 --> 28:16.308
It's almost like time...slows...down.

28:16.309 --> 28:18.316
It's unbelievable, you truly are.

28:18.375 --> 28:19.741
You hear me, Dad?

28:19.742 --> 28:20.903
We did it.

28:20.946 --> 28:22.559
That was amazing.

28:22.605 --> 28:24.224
Kato, I'm serious.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.479
I would get real with you.

28:27.954 --> 28:29.156
So just go with this.

28:29.294 --> 28:30.938
It might get weird and intimate,

28:30.939 --> 28:33.517
but just accept me, okay?

28:33.634 --> 28:34.930
What we did tonight?

28:35.521 --> 28:37.231
Was fantastic.

28:37.232 --> 28:38.358
It was amazing.

28:38.359 --> 28:40.989
We saved those people, man.

28:40.990 --> 28:42.213
We saved their lives.

28:42.317 --> 28:43.680
So here's what I'm saying.

28:43.962 --> 28:45.353
We keep doing this.

28:45.354 --> 28:47.727
You can beat the crap out of
a million dudes at once.

28:47.728 --> 28:50.307
'Cause you can freeze time or something,
when your heart starts pumping.

28:50.308 --> 28:52.354
We do that every night, I'm saying.

28:52.837 --> 28:54.150
Kato.
Kato?

28:56.603 --> 29:00.584
*(Sings) We could be heroes.*

29:00.585 --> 29:02.180
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look.

29:02.879 --> 29:04.749
We're on television.

29:05.886 --> 29:07.128
We're on T.V.

29:08.104 --> 29:10.341
-Was captured in this surveillance tape.
-Look at me.

29:10.342 --> 29:14.021
-Where am I?
-I don't know.
-That was confronted by, but managed to escape.

29:14.635 --> 29:16.548
I'm to fast for T.V.

29:16.549 --> 29:18.094
Yes, exactly.

29:18.095 --> 29:20.700
Desecrated and this within days..

29:20.701 --> 29:23.542
We saved those people, and they just
talk about his stupid head.

29:23.717 --> 29:27.118
How can we be heroes if
they think we're criminals?

29:27.120 --> 29:29.751
Are considered armed, and dangerous.

29:34.619 --> 29:37.896
Okay, think about this, Kato.

29:38.338 --> 29:43.595
What is the one insanely stupid thing
every super hero has in common?

29:44.599 --> 29:45.599
Tights.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.800
No.

29:46.873 --> 29:47.873
Cape.

29:47.874 --> 29:49.254
No, Kato.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.892
It's that every one knows
that they're the good guy.

29:52.893 --> 29:54.368
The hero, you know.

29:54.369 --> 29:57.303
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping some innocent people.

29:57.304 --> 29:59.962
And he's got the good guy by the nuts.
He's got to do whatever he says.

29:59.963 --> 30:02.370
It's in every movie. It's in every comic book.

30:02.371 --> 30:04.477
It's in everything. It's so stupid.

30:04.478 --> 30:07.397
But, if the bad guy thought the good guy,

30:07.398 --> 30:08.756
was also a bad guy.

30:08.898 --> 30:11.516
He wouldn't be able to do that.
That's what we'll do differently.

30:11.742 --> 30:14.091
We will pose as villains.

30:14.092 --> 30:16.092
But we'll act like heroes.

30:16.093 --> 30:18.608
But then the police, and the bad guys,

30:18.609 --> 30:20.276
will both try to kill us.

30:20.627 --> 30:22.223
We're dead already, Kato.

30:22.794 --> 30:24.942
I mean, seriously you wouldn't...

30:25.083 --> 30:28.345
Look at us. We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

30:28.643 --> 30:30.463
You a little bit more than me.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.128
I mean, what do you want your
autobiography to be called?

30:33.167 --> 30:35.748
Oil changes, and cappuccino’s?

30:35.885 --> 30:40.421
Because I think, "Balls deep, in shit kicking dudes".

30:40.847 --> 30:44.022
By Kato. Is a much cooler sounding book.

30:44.023 --> 30:46.246
I would read that book, and
I don't read shit.

30:46.247 --> 30:48.198
But when they've adapted it into a movie.

30:48.199 --> 30:49.826
I would see the shit out of it.

30:50.198 --> 30:51.198
Kato.

30:51.199 --> 30:53.240
You should never make coffee for anyone again.

30:53.241 --> 30:54.246
It's a waste of your talent.

30:54.247 --> 30:56.755
It's not dying that you need to be afraid of.

30:56.811 --> 30:59.354
It's never having lived in the first place.

31:03.809 --> 31:06.249
It did feel good. Saving those people.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.780
Well technically I saved them,
but you helped, I guess. Yeah.

31:08.781 --> 31:11.222
-Whatever.
-Whatever. Let's not get technical.

31:11.223 --> 31:13.368
But why would people take us serious?

31:13.369 --> 31:15.386
We're just two guys who stole a head.

31:18.986 --> 31:19.986
Hmm?

31:21.834 --> 31:24.039
I know how to make them take us seriously.

31:31.525 --> 31:33.557
All right, gentlemen.
Here ye, here ye.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.650
The court is in session.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.484
Let's talk shop, okay.

31:36.823 --> 31:38.192
Shall we?

31:39.417 --> 31:40.621
Who is this guy?

31:41.623 --> 31:42.763
Who is your friend?

31:42.764 --> 31:43.959
He's my man.

31:43.960 --> 31:44.977
I'm not your man.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.722
He's not my man, no.

31:46.723 --> 31:48.701
He's uh, he's not my man.

31:48.702 --> 31:49.859
He's like, uh...

31:49.860 --> 31:52.055
He's like, "My man".
He's...my...uh...

31:52.056 --> 31:53.791
Not your...it's platonic...we're just...

31:53.791 --> 31:56.370
Platonic friends. We're platonic male friends.

31:56.371 --> 31:58.792
He's my, Executive associate.

32:00.211 --> 32:03.289
Yes, that's who he is, and that doesn't matter.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.331
What does matter,

32:04.332 --> 32:07.346
is how we tackle this horrible incident.

32:07.715 --> 32:10.055
It's clear to me that whoever did
this means business.

32:10.056 --> 32:11.286
And this is just the beginning.

32:11.421 --> 32:12.745
Talking about business.

32:12.746 --> 32:15.585
This vandalizing business, oh I get it.

32:15.766 --> 32:19.111
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.

32:19.112 --> 32:21.600
I will blow this guy in any
proportion I like.

32:21.726 --> 32:26.247
This is my newspaper, Axford, and I
want this man on the front page of it.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.089
I want him on the web page.

32:28.090 --> 32:29.820
I want you to blog about him.

32:29.821 --> 32:32.255
I want him on every news outlet we have.

32:32.256 --> 32:34.054
I want the whole city to know,

32:34.055 --> 32:35.761
how dangerous this man is.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.296
The man that cut the head off
of my father's statue.

32:39.297 --> 32:40.465
Not yours.

32:41.926 --> 32:42.926
All right.

32:43.149 --> 32:47.326
Um, since there isn't real
info on the guys identity.

32:47.327 --> 32:49.748
Um, what do we call him?

33:00.842 --> 33:02.117
That's easy.

33:02.509 --> 33:03.599
I got it.

33:04.813 --> 33:05.912
This man,

33:06.187 --> 33:10.484
is called,
"The Green Bee".

33:15.951 --> 33:17.224
It's kinda lame.

33:17.225 --> 33:19.197
Yeah, it sounds like a knitting store, or something.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.793
Sounds like an energy bar.

33:20.794 --> 33:23.056
No, I...I...it came out wrong.

33:25.122 --> 33:26.122
(all talking at once)

33:27.377 --> 33:28.364
Make it like the green decimal.

33:31.869 --> 33:33.112
The Green Hornet.

33:33.113 --> 33:34.880
Naw, it's more like, uh.

33:34.881 --> 33:36.403
-What?
-What did?

33:36.404 --> 33:37.636
The Green Hornet.

33:39.626 --> 33:41.149
Well that's pretty awesome.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.340
Much better.

33:42.341 --> 33:44.216
-You guys like that?
-Yeah.

33:44.217 --> 33:45.824
Green Hornet it is.

33:46.376 --> 33:48.773
-The Green Hornet.
-Okay, okay, fine.

33:48.774 --> 33:50.745
-Fine, it's decided then.
-Yeah.

33:51.191 --> 33:53.708
The front page of tomorrow's newspaper
will feature,

33:53.709 --> 33:55.585
"The Green Hornet".

33:55.586 --> 33:59.029
-Unless you like "Green Bee" better, anyone?
-Nah, no. Oh that's much worse.

33:59.703 --> 34:00.994
Okay fine. Okay.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.533
Let's roll, Kato.

34:07.209 --> 34:08.650
It's going to be a long night.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.172
I am.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.205
We need to think of a cool name for you.

34:32.206 --> 34:33.485
The little stinger.

34:33.487 --> 34:34.529
I'm the Green Hornet.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.581
You're my little stinger.

34:35.583 --> 34:36.583
No way.

34:37.437 --> 34:38.888
The Honey Pot.

34:38.889 --> 34:41.303
Get it. Bee's make honey.
You're my honey pot.

34:43.293 --> 34:44.360
It's my homes.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.396
Decapitated statues?

34:50.397 --> 34:52.286
I've decapitated real people.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.002
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.770
You don't need their fucking business.

34:58.024 --> 34:59.236
I'm not worried.

35:00.502 --> 35:01.880
Who told you I'm worried?

35:02.575 --> 35:07.044
D.A. Scanlon, D.A. Scanlon. With the nightclub bombing
last week, and now this Green Hornet guy.

35:07.044 --> 35:09.700
I understand the streets might not be as safe
as you're make them out to be.

35:09.701 --> 35:13.914
Guys, guys. Stop, stop connecting
separate dots with invisible lines.

35:13.915 --> 35:16.272
This Green Hornet thing, is just a prank.

35:16.602 --> 35:18.474
Now what you guys should be reporting on is,

35:18.475 --> 35:21.787
that with this public office, crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

35:22.697 --> 35:23.697
Thank you.

35:52.748 --> 35:53.748
-Hi.
-Hi.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.837
I'm Lenore Case.

35:55.997 --> 35:58.658
I'm the temp for Mr. Reid's secretarial position.

35:59.201 --> 36:00.432
Today's my first day.

36:01.067 --> 36:03.060
Oh, nice to meet you.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.084
I'm Kato.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.090
It's my first day, too.

36:06.095 --> 36:08.019
Really, well nice to meet you.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.899
Do you work for Mr. Reid?

36:10.164 --> 36:12.405
I'm his, Executive Associate.

36:12.406 --> 36:14.506
Wow, that must be great.

36:14.608 --> 36:15.762
Yeah, it is.

36:16.003 --> 36:17.193
So far.

36:17.449 --> 36:19.938
Kato, I've a really important question for you.

36:19.939 --> 36:24.569
Uh, who is the Hottie-Boom-Body who's
standing right behind me, right now?

36:24.570 --> 36:26.351
I'm kidding, hi I'm Britt Reid.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.067
-I own this newspaper, what's going on?
-It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

36:29.068 --> 36:30.739
-I'm Lenore Case.
-Thanks...Oh.

36:30.740 --> 36:33.625
I've been sent to you to be your temp
until you find a secretary.

36:34.216 --> 36:35.216
Aaah.

36:36.938 --> 36:37.938
Jackpot.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.191
Right this way.

36:39.317 --> 36:40.321
So.

36:41.682 --> 36:44.208
Got one, why don't you tell me.

36:44.209 --> 36:48.837
How do you feel about the state of this newspaper?

36:49.329 --> 36:51.783
As it stands, today.

36:51.857 --> 36:52.857
Give.

36:53.054 --> 36:56.787
To be honest, this paper has taken
a dip in the last few years.

36:56.788 --> 36:59.175
-In quality and ambition.
-Really?

36:59.305 --> 37:02.704
Well, of course the entire industry has
taken a hit because of the internet.

37:02.705 --> 37:06.684
So there's a lot of pressure to
print easy to digest articles.

37:06.685 --> 37:09.121
And it is THE last family owned paper in the city.

37:09.122 --> 37:12.424
And one of the only ones not attached to
a conglomerate in the entire country.

37:12.425 --> 37:13.525
So it's understandable.

37:13.525 --> 37:16.715
-Conglomerate?
-But the Sentinel used to really use its independence,

37:16.716 --> 37:18.482
to be brazen at the very least.

37:18.483 --> 37:21.366
Like that article that your father wrote,
just after the night club bombing.

37:21.367 --> 37:25.152
That was real reporting. That is the kind
of article that can really make a difference.

37:26.212 --> 37:29.050
Wow. That was good. You know a
lot about this shit.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.836
I, I studied journalism. I have a minor in criminology.

37:32.837 --> 37:34.103
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:34.306 --> 37:35.747
Criminology.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.438
Study the criminal mind.

37:37.439 --> 37:39.656
What are your thoughts on this
Green Hornet character?

37:40.004 --> 37:41.196
Give.

37:41.855 --> 37:45.079
-Um, well first off, there's two kinds of criminals.
-Okay.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.467
There's the psycho ego-maniac and the power maniac.

37:48.468 --> 37:50.029
He uh, he seems to be the second,

37:50.030 --> 37:53.244
-Because he defies the media.
-Excuse me, what do you think he'll do next?

37:53.483 --> 37:57.011
Yeah, that's. Uh, what is his next move,
is what I was going to ask.

37:58.403 --> 37:59.403
(mouths) Write it down.

37:59.613 --> 38:02.621
Well, he'll probably try to appropriate more power.

38:02.777 --> 38:05.370
You know, he'll hit somebody on their own turf.

38:05.371 --> 38:07.435
Basically he'll start out small.

38:07.436 --> 38:08.977
And then he'll work his way up to the top.

38:08.978 --> 38:11.615
That's what John Gotti did to Paul Costellano in '85.

38:12.214 --> 38:13.680
-And it worked?
-Yes.

38:14.815 --> 38:16.246
Wow, look at you.

38:16.247 --> 38:18.497
You really know a lot about this stuff.

38:18.498 --> 38:20.430
And you're lovely and beautiful.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.844
I was just sitting here, thinking.

38:21.845 --> 38:24.323
Why are you only pursuing this in your, uh...

38:25.654 --> 38:27.594
Kato, help me out here, uh....

38:27.880 --> 38:29.086
Twilight.

38:32.088 --> 38:33.904
-Twilight?
-Yeah.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.271
I, I saw the movie but I don't see how...

38:37.272 --> 38:38.965
Oh no, no, not like that.

38:38.966 --> 38:39.988
Not, not like the movie.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.350
I guess if we were doing movies, it would be more like...

38:42.663 --> 38:44.253
Uh, Cocoon.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.116
Or, something like that.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.969
Later in ones years.

38:48.970 --> 38:50.555
What, I'm only 36.

38:50.556 --> 38:51.841
(Whispers) Thirty six?

38:51.842 --> 38:53.918
Holy shit, that's crazy.

38:53.918 --> 38:57.721
I thought you were like 31 tops.
I didn't know we can hire 36 year olds.

38:57.725 --> 38:59.452
We'll have to build a ramp, huh?

38:59.935 --> 39:01.361
Why, why now?

39:01.362 --> 39:02.681
She doesn't want to tell you.

39:02.682 --> 39:04.420
I don't think you know what you're
talking about, Kato.

39:04.421 --> 39:05.901
No, Mr. Kato is right.

39:05.902 --> 39:07.934
I do not feel comfortable discussing this.

39:07.935 --> 39:10.329
And if this means I am not going
to be your temp any longer?

39:10.330 --> 39:11.897
Then I'm sorry, it's...

39:11.898 --> 39:13.251
That's exactly what it means.

39:14.843 --> 39:16.775
-Yep.
-Okay, thank you.

39:17.148 --> 39:20.051
'Cause you are now my permanent secretary.

39:20.326 --> 39:23.288
Here is what has gone down, Lenore.

39:23.289 --> 39:25.115
You've displayed two things.

39:25.586 --> 39:26.586
Balls.

39:26.768 --> 39:28.707
And there's one thing I like on my women.

39:29.939 --> 39:31.323
(Whispers) It's balls.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.156
Please me my permanent secretary.

39:33.157 --> 39:34.184
Are you kidding me?

39:34.185 --> 39:36.761
I'm not kidding. This is how I do it,
this is how I roll.

39:36.762 --> 39:38.222
Every day, all day.

39:38.223 --> 39:39.975
I make it rain like this, okay.

39:39.976 --> 39:41.535
I want you to come work for me.

39:41.611 --> 39:42.868
Just say yes. Just say yes.

39:42.869 --> 39:44.202
-Really?
-Don't think, just say yes.

39:44.203 --> 39:46.256
-Okay, I'll do it, yes.
-Thank you, yes!

39:46.257 --> 39:47.792
-This is so exciting.
-It is exciting.

39:47.793 --> 39:49.540
-Mr. Kato thank you so much.
-Don't thank him.

39:49.541 --> 39:52.779
-He did nothing.
-Thank you, I promise I will not disappoint you.

39:52.780 --> 39:54.820
-I don't think you will.
-I will definitely do research.

39:54.821 --> 39:56.605
-Good, good.
-I will do fact checking, spell checking.

39:56.606 --> 39:58.192
-Anything that you need.
-Perfect, well...

39:58.193 --> 40:01.719
why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research. Actually that's perfect.

40:02.105 --> 40:04.161
Bam! She is hot!

40:04.162 --> 40:05.482
It's crazy how hot she is.

40:05.483 --> 40:07.098
-She's listening.
-Did you write down
everything that she said?

40:07.099 --> 40:08.115
-I think.
-Let me see.

40:09.738 --> 40:10.738
Pervert.

40:11.608 --> 40:12.956
Let's get to work, Kato.

40:14.509 --> 40:15.873
All right, we got a plan.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.907
We start small, work our way up to the top.

40:17.908 --> 40:18.911
Okay.

40:20.075 --> 40:21.218
We'll need a car.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.651
Hell's yes, we'll need a car.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.080
With internal weapons.

40:24.943 --> 40:27.389
-Armor.
-Cool rims, spinning rims.

40:27.390 --> 40:28.623
Slurpee machine.

40:28.624 --> 40:30.193
A horn that plays La Cucaracha.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.123
It'll be loaded up the ass with cool shit.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.140
-I can do that.
-Kato, I want you to take my hand.

40:35.441 --> 40:37.639
And I want you to come
with me on this adventure.

40:37.759 --> 40:39.024
I'll go with you.

40:39.025 --> 40:40.962
But I don't want to touch you.

40:40.963 --> 40:42.250
Okay, you don't have to take my hand.

40:42.251 --> 40:43.724
But will you come with me on this adventure?

40:44.561 --> 40:46.561
* The White Stripes: Blue Orchid*

40:56.748 --> 41:02.136
*Something better than nothing, is giving up.
You needed the something. *

41:03.195 --> 41:06.205
*So I gave you the truth from showing up*

41:06.914 --> 41:08.166
*How dare you*

41:09.892 --> 41:12.824
*How old are you now anyway?*

41:13.200 --> 41:14.563
*How dare you*

41:16.148 --> 41:18.918
*How old are you now anyway?*

41:21.682 --> 41:22.682
This one.

41:24.179 --> 41:26.012
This will kill a bad girl.

41:26.013 --> 41:27.013
*How dare you*

41:28.577 --> 41:31.225
*How old are you now anyway?*
-Kato!

41:31.226 --> 41:33.235
Come closer.

41:33.236 --> 41:34.581
I have an idea for the car.

41:35.302 --> 41:36.573
Ejector seats.

41:37.084 --> 41:38.255
Ejector seats?

41:38.305 --> 41:40.061
You don't think it's a good idea?

41:43.029 --> 41:44.432
-Hello.
-Hello.

41:50.024 --> 41:52.495
*You got a reaction.*

41:53.043 --> 41:56.087
*You got a reaction, didn't you?*

41:56.088 --> 41:58.447
*You took a white orchid,*

41:59.174 --> 42:02.688
*You took a white orchid, turned it blue*

42:02.689 --> 42:04.417
*Something better than nothing.*

42:05.613 --> 42:08.879
*Something better than nothing
Is giving up*

42:08.880 --> 42:11.189
*You needed the something*

42:12.093 --> 42:15.253
*You got a reaction, didn't you?*

42:15.254 --> 42:17.237
*You took a white orchid,*

42:18.337 --> 42:21.528
*You took a white orchid, turned it blue.*

42:21.529 --> 42:23.167
I'm so excited right now.

42:24.174 --> 42:25.347
I can't wait.

42:30.423 --> 42:31.932
Aw, man. What the hell?

42:32.161 --> 42:33.161
Watch your feet.

42:34.224 --> 42:36.026
The glory of the Black Beauty.

42:37.029 --> 42:40.787
Damn. It's beautiful.

42:41.945 --> 42:43.205
It's black.

42:43.717 --> 42:44.717
Wow.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.025
Incredible.

42:55.132 --> 42:57.235
Oh, dude. We're forgetting something very important.

42:58.682 --> 42:59.933
Watch this.

43:04.645 --> 43:06.276
That is so wicked.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.933
*Coolio: Gangsta's Paradise*

43:10.237 --> 43:13.266
*As I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,*

43:13.267 --> 43:14.795
*I take a look at my life,*

43:14.796 --> 43:16.667
*And realize there's nothing left,*

43:16.667 --> 43:19.237
*'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long*

43:19.238 --> 43:22.431
*That even my momma thinks that my mind has gone.*

43:22.432 --> 43:27.903
*Tell me why are we, so blind to see *

43:27.904 --> 43:34.063
*That the ones we hurt, are you and me*

43:35.405 --> 43:38.944
*Been spending most our lives living in the Gangs.....*

43:39.307 --> 43:40.308
Where are we going?

43:40.309 --> 43:42.056
I have no idea, I thought you knew.

43:42.308 --> 43:44.266
Oh, Okay. I got an idea.

43:44.403 --> 43:45.403
Okay.

43:48.305 --> 43:49.438
Mr. Reids' office.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.927
(Lecherous voice)
I'm looking at you.

43:51.928 --> 43:53.665
-What?
-I'm totally joking.

43:53.666 --> 43:54.785
Britt Reid, calling.

43:55.123 --> 43:57.670
Burning the candle at both ends, I see.

43:58.076 --> 44:01.296
Wouldn't Mr. Case be upset with that?

44:02.530 --> 44:04.106
There is no Mr. Case.

44:04.638 --> 44:06.256
Well that's not why I'm calling.

44:06.564 --> 44:08.272
I'm actually calling because, uh.

44:08.273 --> 44:10.327
Remember seeing all that Green Hornet research?

44:10.328 --> 44:12.112
You know, predicting what he might do next.

44:12.113 --> 44:14.431
If you could just send us that. Those crime maps.

44:14.432 --> 44:15.970
-Oh, yeah.
-That would be really helpful.

44:15.971 --> 44:18.272
-Just fax it on over.
-Yes, hold on a second, please.

44:18.273 --> 44:19.759
And it's coming right at you.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.884
-If you need anything else.
-Okay.

44:23.885 --> 44:24.949
-You just let me know.
-Perfect.

44:24.950 --> 44:26.463
-Thank you, bye, bye.

44:28.377 --> 44:30.654
She wants me so bad, it's crazy.

44:36.259 --> 44:37.548
-Oh.
-South Central.

44:37.549 --> 44:40.465
Yeah. Okay, we got 14 homicides.

44:40.466 --> 44:41.827
34 assaults.

44:41.828 --> 44:43.435
116 and sixteen drug arrests.

44:43.548 --> 44:44.872
This month.

44:45.156 --> 44:47.945
Sounds like a good place for the
Green Hornet to make his debut.

44:48.557 --> 44:49.561
Let's roll, Kato.

44:49.562 --> 44:50.930
Let's roll.

44:54.401 --> 44:55.918
This is really far east.

44:56.522 --> 44:58.082
Never been in this part of town.

45:00.374 --> 45:02.138
I think we're in the hood, Kato.

45:04.021 --> 45:06.964
Wait, wait. Do you think we start there?

45:07.266 --> 45:09.075
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

45:09.076 --> 45:10.924
Start small, work our way up.

45:11.286 --> 45:12.746
This is really, really intense.

45:13.406 --> 45:16.997
-So, you don't want to do it?
-I do, I do. We should just do it fast
before we chicken out, okay?

45:16.998 --> 45:18.850
-I not going to chicken out.
-Who knows you might chicken out.

45:18.851 --> 45:20.368
I know, just...just pull up to them.

45:20.369 --> 45:21.505
I don't want to talk.

45:21.506 --> 45:23.026
What, they're on your side.

45:23.027 --> 45:24.747
-Stop yelling at me.
-Just pull it over and...

45:24.748 --> 45:27.249
-I barely speak English.
-You speak English right now.

45:27.250 --> 45:29.771
-Okay, fine.
-This is so stupid.

45:30.046 --> 45:31.616
Oh, okay.

45:31.617 --> 45:32.616
-Calm down.
-I am calm.

45:32.616 --> 45:35.003
-Just shut up, this is scary....you shut up!!
-Scary, you shut up!

45:35.003 --> 45:37.190
-I'm just trying to be cool.
-I am cool.

45:39.987 --> 45:42.057
Yo, you looking for that good stuff, man?

45:42.241 --> 45:43.241
Hola.

45:43.290 --> 45:44.967
I am The Green Hornet.

45:45.062 --> 45:47.197
And I would like to sit down with your boss.

45:47.198 --> 45:48.512
Sit on this, bitch.

45:51.785 --> 45:52.785
Oh, God!

45:54.085 --> 45:55.085
Move on!

46:04.593 --> 46:06.665
Bean bags.
Where the hell are the bean bags?

46:10.805 --> 46:11.809
Yeah!

46:11.810 --> 46:13.860
YEAAAAHH!

46:13.861 --> 46:15.542
Let me show you how it's done, Kato.

46:16.994 --> 46:20.598
Green...Hornet...said...hello.

46:42.621 --> 46:44.220
Eat my foot.

46:44.894 --> 46:45.894
Bitch.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.175
My nuts!

46:56.007 --> 46:57.516
What the hell was that?

47:00.344 --> 47:02.461
Who do you work fo..oh god.

47:06.088 --> 47:07.547
Who do you work for?

47:07.870 --> 47:08.870
Shit.

47:09.391 --> 47:11.506
Hey! You come, come here, come here.

47:11.507 --> 47:12.807
Hey, who do you work for?

47:12.845 --> 47:15.395
Chudnofsky
Same guy everybody works for.

47:15.396 --> 47:17.192
-Chud-what-ski?
-Chudnofsky

47:17.849 --> 47:19.270
What kind of dumb name is that?

47:19.271 --> 47:21.423
-Chudnofsky
-Where do you get the shit you sell for him, huh, where?

47:21.424 --> 47:22.704
I'll never tell you that.

47:22.827 --> 47:24.289
Oh really, never.

47:27.141 --> 47:30.308
Chudnofsky's on our ass guys.
We've got to get the shit done tonight.

47:38.441 --> 47:40.495
You've just been stung.

47:40.693 --> 47:41.693
Yeah.

47:41.694 --> 47:42.952
You.

47:43.039 --> 47:45.501
This is my town, now.

47:45.502 --> 47:47.373
My name is 'The Green Hornet'.

47:48.417 --> 47:50.273
Hello there, nice to meet you.

47:50.274 --> 47:51.642
Hello, how's it going?

47:51.927 --> 47:53.369
Uh, anyway.

47:53.449 --> 47:57.398
Tell your boss, The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

47:57.735 --> 47:58.735
Dude.

48:00.490 --> 48:02.902
You broke my lab, man.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.959
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

48:09.087 --> 48:10.909
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

48:28.893 --> 48:30.707
Explain yourself, Mr. Tupper.

48:30.903 --> 48:32.676
The guy was crazy, man.

48:32.677 --> 48:35.002
I mean he drove a car through a wall.

48:35.156 --> 48:38.970
The thing was like a half-tank or something.
There was fire coming out of the thing.

48:39.312 --> 48:40.312
And?

48:41.395 --> 48:43.075
Oh yeah, he gave me this.

48:44.467 --> 48:46.742
He said that this is his town now.

48:48.838 --> 48:52.470
A man comes in, in a rented costume
and you shit your pants?

48:52.471 --> 48:54.465
Look, trust me.

48:54.466 --> 48:57.378
A guy...grown man wearing a mask.

48:57.379 --> 49:00.182
Is a little bit scarier than a guy wearing a suit.

49:06.399 --> 49:08.308
You're not pleased with my suit?

49:08.310 --> 49:10.560
Does it fail to fill you with fear?

49:13.058 --> 49:16.210
I'm sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect.

49:16.211 --> 49:20.197
Do you have any idea how many great
people I've killed in my suit?

49:22.357 --> 49:24.169
-I like your suit.
-Me too.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.596
Now this is exactly what I was talking about.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.686
I'm not as scary as some idiot in a green mask.

49:29.687 --> 49:31.056
Come on!

49:31.689 --> 49:33.872
You say they want to take business.

49:33.875 --> 49:37.496
Now this guy ran six of the biggest meth labs in L.A.

49:37.497 --> 49:39.389
Now because of that Hornet, he's dead.

49:39.975 --> 49:41.467
Business affected.

49:41.952 --> 49:45.937
Well I've got three reports of the Green Hornet
shooting on a red light here.

49:45.938 --> 49:50.781
I have an elderly couple that claims that the Green Hornet
gave them the finger.

49:50.782 --> 49:55.382
The Green Hornet and his Chauffeur in a fist
fight with gang members in south central.

49:55.383 --> 49:57.754
The Green Hornet raises a lot of questions.

49:57.755 --> 50:00.747
We all know that gang proliferation
has been rising in the last few years.

50:00.748 --> 50:04.876
Okay, that'll be homework. I got a Yoga class.

50:04.877 --> 50:10.683
Anywho, bottom line. Headlines people.
Get this story out there.

50:10.684 --> 50:13.645
Will the violence continue to spill out onto the streets?

50:13.646 --> 50:16.279
What are the police doing about him?

50:16.280 --> 50:22.481
Is anyone safe at the mercy of
dot-dot-dot, The Green Hornet.

50:22.482 --> 50:24.752
And I want those dots,
I want dots in the paper.

50:24.753 --> 50:27.503
Mr. Reid, do you understand
that's kind of hitting it delicately?

50:27.502 --> 50:30.174
-No.
-That D.A. Scanlon's entire reelection,

50:30.175 --> 50:32.431
platform is based on him cleaning up the streets.

50:32.432 --> 50:34.541
I know you guys are acquaintances.
So if you want to...

50:34.542 --> 50:37.644
Oh, actually that's a great idea.
You should use that.

50:37.645 --> 50:39.294
Write an article about that.

50:39.295 --> 50:43.125
Even D.A. Scanlon is quivering at the
feet of this scourge.

50:43.126 --> 50:44.424
Use the word, 'scourge'.

50:44.425 --> 50:45.868
Write an article about that.

50:45.869 --> 50:48.341
-Britt, can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

50:48.483 --> 50:50.260
Look, I know what you're tying to do here.

50:50.261 --> 50:53.732
Turn this newspaper into some kind of discothèque.
But it's not going to work.

50:53.733 --> 50:56.380
That's now what I'm doing. She's a brainy broad, dude.

50:56.381 --> 50:57.654
This is a serious matter.

50:57.655 --> 51:00.215
For every line that we print, there's repercussions.

51:00.216 --> 51:01.770
Somebody has to take responsibilities.

51:01.771 --> 51:04.208
-That's me!
-Well, I'm not afraid of these bastards.

51:04.209 --> 51:05.518
And you shouldn't be either.

51:06.642 --> 51:09.020
Their leader was Daniel, he made it to the wall.

51:09.286 --> 51:12.468
They killed for wanting and speculating on the drug war.

51:12.469 --> 51:15.163
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

51:15.760 --> 51:18.403
I know that you think my
experience ain't a worth shit.

51:18.404 --> 51:20.659
But your father used to listen to me.
So should you.

51:20.660 --> 51:22.882
This is the story I want to run.

51:22.883 --> 51:26.117
I'm going with it, and if you are fortunate
enough to be still with us.

51:26.118 --> 51:32.977
It's what, Daniel Ver...vertila, Vertila...Ver-te-lie?

51:32.978 --> 51:34.644
Ver-tel-lie, it's what he would have wanted, too.

51:34.645 --> 51:35.645
Okay.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.725
That's the story, team.

51:37.725 --> 51:38.725
Run it!

51:39.638 --> 51:41.305
Britt Reid, out true.

51:41.625 --> 51:43.625
*Van Halen: Feel Your Love Tonight*

51:47.011 --> 51:48.011
*Alright!*

51:49.715 --> 51:50.715
Zzzzzp, zzzp.

51:55.975 --> 51:59.020
*We're gettin' funny in the back of my car*

51:59.643 --> 52:04.517
*I'm sorry honey if I took
you just a little too far, yes*

52:04.518 --> 52:05.596
I want this Hornet guy!

52:05.597 --> 52:07.589
*Uh too, too far*

52:09.383 --> 52:13.000
*So I, I told the fellas out behind the bar*

52:13.820 --> 52:19.235
*So let me tell you honey just how fine you are, yes*

52:19.649 --> 52:21.711
*I guess you are*

52:23.008 --> 52:26.000
*You see I'm beggin' you pleeease*

52:26.275 --> 52:30.117
*beggin' on, beggin' on my knees*

52:30.601 --> 52:34.631
*Sayin' I can't wait to feel your love....*
-Wait, don't, don't, don't!

52:34.632 --> 52:35.966
Camera got us.

52:41.632 --> 52:42.985
What camera?

52:46.073 --> 52:50.853
The Green Hornet and his masked accomplish
started major trouble in the southland today.

52:55.251 --> 52:58.299
-Kato, is in the house.
-Yes.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.667
I just checked the Hornet mail.

52:59.668 --> 53:02.226
Nothing new, but they'll be a knocking.

53:02.588 --> 53:03.988
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

53:05.428 --> 53:07.261
-I have something for you.
-Really?

53:07.262 --> 53:08.269
Awesome.

53:12.353 --> 53:13.608
Dear Britt,

53:13.609 --> 53:16.668
You are my, xiongdì .
What's xiongdì ?

53:16.920 --> 53:18.490
Brother.

53:18.491 --> 53:20.173
That's awfully nice.

53:21.740 --> 53:24.356
I've never had a brother, man.
I've always wanted one.

53:27.623 --> 53:29.388
Whoa!

53:29.893 --> 53:31.281
What the hell is this?

53:31.282 --> 53:32.392
It's a gas gun.

53:32.393 --> 53:33.736
Your Hornet gun!

53:34.142 --> 53:35.628
-A gas gun?
-Yeah.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.550
Why not a gun, gun?

53:37.551 --> 53:39.391
Our enemies have gun, guns.

53:39.392 --> 53:42.564
What, I don't understand, why, what are these?

53:42.565 --> 53:44.587
What is this? What are these?
These paint balls?

53:44.588 --> 53:47.086
No, these are filled with knock-out gas.

53:47.088 --> 53:49.174
That is insane. Where's yours?

53:49.175 --> 53:51.584
Do you have one? Do have a black
version or something?

53:51.585 --> 53:52.787
No, just you.

53:53.033 --> 53:54.775
-No?
-No.

53:55.030 --> 53:56.434
Well why not? Why just me?

53:56.614 --> 53:58.876
You, you're so special.

53:59.112 --> 54:01.721
I know I'm special, but how come
I'm the only one with a gun?

54:01.782 --> 54:04.083
Because you don't have much fighting experience.

54:04.084 --> 54:05.853
So I thought you needed a gun.

54:05.970 --> 54:09.467
Well, I'll be honest, that's a little insulting, man.

54:09.468 --> 54:11.360
I mean I thought we were both
bad asses the other night.

54:11.361 --> 54:14.650
I kicked that guy in the face like three times,
remember? I kicked him in the face.

54:14.651 --> 54:16.653
-Yeah, I...I remember.
-Yeah.

54:17.345 --> 54:18.654
It makes you look cool.

54:18.655 --> 54:20.077
I need to look cool now?

54:20.200 --> 54:22.443
What the hell?
You said my outfit was pimp.

54:22.445 --> 54:24.496
I remember thinking, that's a weird
word for him to use, pimp.

54:24.497 --> 54:26.126
But you said it, you said it was pimp.

54:26.127 --> 54:26.906
-It is pimp.
-Yeah.

54:27.044 --> 54:29.374
The Hornet gun is just an accessory.

54:29.375 --> 54:30.380
-An accessory.
-Yeah.

54:30.381 --> 54:33.079
Well then, you need...you need nun chucks then.

54:33.828 --> 54:35.642
If you don't like it, don't use it.

54:35.643 --> 54:37.086
No, let me...how does it work?

54:37.960 --> 54:38.960
Shit!

54:42.845 --> 54:43.845
It works.

54:55.302 --> 54:57.867
KATO!
Kato!

54:57.868 --> 54:58.904
Over here.

55:01.751 --> 55:03.493
Hey, you're awake.

55:03.494 --> 55:04.774
What the hell, what happened to me?

55:04.775 --> 55:06.874
What's happening?
What happened?

55:06.875 --> 55:08.733
You shot yourself in the face, by mistake.

55:09.334 --> 55:12.112
Ho...ho..how long was I out? What time is it?

55:12.615 --> 55:13.615
Two o'clock.

55:14.357 --> 55:16.313
Oh, that's not so bad, I guess.

55:16.860 --> 55:18.079
On Thursday.

55:18.607 --> 55:21.453
It's Thursday, are you kid...it's not Monday right now?

55:21.454 --> 55:22.719
No, I'm sorry.

55:30.006 --> 55:31.703
Did you put this diaper on me?

55:37.272 --> 55:38.272
Well what did I miss?

55:38.691 --> 55:39.798
Nothing, really.

55:39.799 --> 55:41.853
I did some work on the Black Beauties.

55:41.854 --> 55:42.853
Beau-tie's?

55:44.582 --> 55:45.991
Holy crap.

55:45.992 --> 55:47.335
Back-ups.

55:47.976 --> 55:50.172
How the hell did you do this in four days?

55:50.437 --> 55:52.139
It's been eleven days.

55:54.189 --> 55:56.136
Whoa, eleven days?

55:56.137 --> 55:57.545
What, are you kidding me?

55:57.546 --> 55:59.803
I wasn't sleeping. I was in a coma, dick.

56:00.308 --> 56:03.114
But it's okay now. I fixed the Hornet gas.

56:03.115 --> 56:04.876
The gas only lasts one hour.

56:04.877 --> 56:05.838
Can I see it?

56:06.182 --> 56:09.589
-Okay, but be careful this time.
-I'll be careful, I just want to look at it.

56:09.590 --> 56:11.831
Just give to me for one second and I'll just...

56:15.852 --> 56:16.986
See you in a hour.

56:16.987 --> 56:19.011
-Mr. Reid.
-Hey.

56:19.012 --> 56:20.085
Welcome back.

56:20.086 --> 56:21.762
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

56:21.836 --> 56:24.135
I heard that Mono is the worst.

56:24.136 --> 56:25.139
Mono?

56:27.182 --> 56:30.442
Yeah, well it's uh, better than herpes, right?

56:30.443 --> 56:32.184
-Here are you messages.
-Thank you.

56:32.185 --> 56:33.819
I have some meeting's I'd like to set up with you.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.639
Okay, cool, great.

56:35.640 --> 56:38.729
Here is the research that you asked for.

56:38.730 --> 56:41.927
Oooo, Green Hornet, me likee.

56:41.930 --> 56:45.232
D.A. Scanlon called, he said
that he really needs to speak to you.

56:45.233 --> 56:46.362
Boring.

56:46.363 --> 56:47.703
Let me look at this stuff.

57:02.347 --> 57:06.112
Thought maybe we could go to dinner,
or get a drink. Blow off some steam.

57:06.365 --> 57:08.896
Yeah, I would love to.

57:13.753 --> 57:14.753
So.

57:17.793 --> 57:19.679
Perfect, I'll be there.

57:23.829 --> 57:25.325
That was awesome.

57:25.326 --> 57:26.673
Hey, Kato!

57:26.674 --> 57:28.428
Can you make me some coffee.

57:31.696 --> 57:35.972
I know you don't have your whole operations set up.
Whatever you can whip up will be great.

57:36.911 --> 57:40.562
Lenore have you had this little
bastards coffee?

57:40.562 --> 57:42.366
'Cause it is,
scrumdiddlyumptious.

57:42.367 --> 57:44.128
The only way to describe it. You want a cup?

57:44.129 --> 57:45.080
I'm fine, thank you.

57:45.081 --> 57:47.326
So that's just one cup of coffee, Kato.

57:48.319 --> 57:50.112
So, there's this restaurant.

57:50.113 --> 57:52.353
That just opened in the San Fernando valley,

57:52.354 --> 57:56.163
and it's called,
La Maison de lavuad.

57:56.164 --> 57:59.343
And the whole thing, you eat
your meal in total darkness.

57:59.344 --> 58:03.666
So with your deprived sight, each bite
is like a orgasm in your mouth.

58:03.808 --> 58:06.929
-And I was thinking maybe it would be.
-Mr. Reid's office.

58:06.930 --> 58:09.860
This is D.A. Scanlon calling for Britt Reid, please.

58:10.031 --> 58:12.746
Hello sir, yes I'm aware you've been calling.

58:12.747 --> 58:14.425
He's, he's had Mono.

58:14.426 --> 58:17.792
Well let me take a look. Maybe there's a
good chance we can work that out later.

58:20.997 --> 58:23.645
-Ow!
-If you ever tell me to get you coffee again.

58:24.624 --> 58:25.636
I'll beat the shit out of you.

58:25.637 --> 58:28.264
What are you?
What is wrong with you, are you crazy?

58:28.265 --> 58:30.886
This is our plan. You're suppose to work for me.

58:31.190 --> 58:33.157
You got me a java juice.

58:33.158 --> 58:36.587
We're suppose to be bothers, man.
We're suppose to be Shon-dee.

58:36.587 --> 58:38.180
What happened with that?

58:38.180 --> 58:39.947
-Huh?
-I'm sorry.

58:40.496 --> 58:41.840
You should be sorry.

58:41.841 --> 58:43.674
I know it's complicated being super heroes,

58:43.675 --> 58:45.258
and there's a lot of stress involved with that.

58:45.259 --> 58:47.665
But you don't got to freak out about it,
do you, okay?

58:48.281 --> 58:49.738
I'll have the coffee au lait.

58:49.739 --> 58:51.667
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

58:52.364 --> 58:53.708
You're still mad at me, Kato?

58:54.162 --> 58:55.984
-No.
-Good.

58:55.985 --> 58:57.797
'Cause you shouldn't be, anyway.

58:58.362 --> 59:01.472
What's up with Lenore. Is she acting weird around me?

59:01.767 --> 59:02.767
No, why?

59:02.768 --> 59:03.885
I like, like her.

59:03.886 --> 59:06.795
And I can't nail her. She's completely unnailable.

59:06.796 --> 59:09.318
It's I mean, it's a terrible fact.
I don't know what to do.

59:09.319 --> 59:10.366
She doesn't like you.

59:10.367 --> 59:11.905
Why would you even want her?

59:11.906 --> 59:15.080
I do, maybe it's because she doesn’t like me.
Isn't that sick.

59:15.081 --> 59:16.439
That could be it.

59:17.282 --> 59:19.182
Girls are such a drag, Kato.

59:19.183 --> 59:20.611
Thank god we have each other.

59:21.095 --> 59:23.584
Hey, I'm calling a boys night.

59:23.585 --> 59:24.938
What do you say, huh?

59:24.939 --> 59:26.084
What are you doing?

59:26.085 --> 59:29.966
I didn't know you wanted to hang out.
I'm going for a drink with a friend.

59:30.505 --> 59:32.535
Friend, who, come on?

59:33.414 --> 59:34.414
Tony.

59:35.194 --> 59:36.194
Tony?

59:37.703 --> 59:38.703
Well have fun.

59:46.970 --> 59:48.408
-You want to try?
-No.

59:49.177 --> 59:50.260
Hit the black key.

59:50.846 --> 59:52.077
-Really?
-Yeah.

59:52.831 --> 59:54.315
Okay, I'll give it a try. Which one?

01:00:04.483 --> 01:00:09.038
You know this uh, Green Hornet thing
is just crazy, isn't it?

01:00:09.276 --> 01:00:11.200
I mean it's all I can think about sometimes.

01:00:12.096 --> 01:00:14.175
I feel really in tuned with it.

01:00:14.176 --> 01:00:15.955
Kind of like that guy with the Zodiac killer.

01:00:15.956 --> 01:00:18.216
What about the man dressed in black?

01:00:19.362 --> 01:00:20.362
Johnny Cash?

01:00:21.006 --> 01:00:22.675
No. His partner.

01:00:22.676 --> 01:00:26.133
His partner? No I don't think that, that's his partner.

01:00:26.294 --> 01:00:28.430
It's probably just some thug that he hired.

01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.338
Anyhow they'll both be dead in no time.

01:00:30.657 --> 01:00:31.828
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.025
-Why?
-Because.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.545
The Green Hornet's been attracting way to much attention.

01:00:37.724 --> 01:00:40.344
Whoever is in charge is going to get tired of it.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:41.967
Call him in to try and make a deal with him.

01:00:41.968 --> 01:00:44.787
Then kill him. It's what Gotti did to Mengala in '87.

01:00:45.616 --> 01:00:48.460
Two weeks, two weeks tops.
That's what I give them.

01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:49.763
-Two weeks.
-Dead.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.380
You're not going to like this.

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:53.940
But we got nothing.

01:00:54.399 --> 01:00:56.812
It's like the Green Hornet didn't exist.

01:00:56.905 --> 01:00:59.736
Nobody's done a deal with him.
Nobody's done time with him.

01:00:59.737 --> 01:01:01.097
Nobody's ever heard of him.

01:01:01.098 --> 01:01:02.628
It's like he came out of thin air.

01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:05.395
Yeah, and I gotta say.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:07.817
He's setting a bad example for the other gangs.

01:01:08.307 --> 01:01:11.132
I met with the Armenians early today, they told me....

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:14.986
if the Hornet is independent.
They want to be independent too.

01:01:15.994 --> 01:01:17.964
The Armenians truly said that?

01:01:18.543 --> 01:01:21.208
And I heard rumors the Koreans are talking the same.

01:01:21.575 --> 01:01:22.921
Which Korean?

01:01:23.149 --> 01:01:24.149
Kim.

01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:28.026
Kim?

01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:31.424
No, Kim never said that.

01:01:31.879 --> 01:01:34.919
We've been doing business for
twenty five years. We're friends.

01:01:35.551 --> 01:01:37.158
I'm sorry boss.

01:01:37.529 --> 01:01:38.798
That's just shocking.

01:01:39.188 --> 01:01:43.325
Maybe we should go down there and
teach them to keep their mouths shut.

01:01:43.637 --> 01:01:45.129
No, no, no.

01:01:45.864 --> 01:01:48.742
I should kill Kim myself. He's a friend.

01:01:49.893 --> 01:01:53.066
And I'll kill the Armenians, too.
It would make me feel better.

01:01:53.067 --> 01:01:54.620
Wait, wait! AAAAH!

01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:57.646
Great, what about, The Hornet?

01:02:04.918 --> 01:02:05.918
Reid.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:08.645
What you doing here?

01:02:09.114 --> 01:02:11.312
Guess what, you son of a bitch?

01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:15.292
We got mail.

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:17.041
We got Hornet mail!

01:02:17.041 --> 01:02:19.188
He emailed, it happened.

01:02:19.189 --> 01:02:20.709
Come here, look, come here.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.540
Look, look, look.

01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:24.958
Green Hornet.
(Whispers) Me.

01:02:25.017 --> 01:02:27.556
Good job on the Meth lab.
Uhh!

01:02:27.906 --> 01:02:30.578
The place was costing me money and I
wanted to shut it down anyway.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:34.790
That's B.S. Lets talk about another business
venture that could be mutually beneficial.

01:02:34.935 --> 01:02:36.267
Please meet tomorrow.

01:02:36.268 --> 01:02:39.194
At the lot on 5th and Union in downtown.

01:02:39.194 --> 01:02:40.578
At 4 p.m.

01:02:40.783 --> 01:02:43.556
Another adventure for, The Green Hornet,

01:02:43.557 --> 01:02:45.362
and his nameless side kick.

01:02:48.826 --> 01:02:50.965
Looks like we got some planning to do.

01:02:51.445 --> 01:02:52.656
It could be a trap.

01:02:53.028 --> 01:02:56.025
I heard Gotti killed Mangala in '87.

01:02:56.931 --> 01:02:58.513
Where did you hear that from?

01:02:59.945 --> 01:03:01.512
The History channel.

01:03:02.423 --> 01:03:03.423
Oh yeah.

01:03:03.424 --> 01:03:05.850
Should we go downtown now
and check it out?

01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:08.396
Uh, no. That's cool, I got that covered.

01:03:08.397 --> 01:03:10.563
You just fill up the car with
weapons and stuff like that, okay.

01:03:10.836 --> 01:03:14.586
So, you're just going to come
up with the plan by yourself?

01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:16.337
Bingo.

01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:19.074
I don't know if that's the best idea.

01:03:19.075 --> 01:03:21.000
-'Course you don't, Kato.
-What's that mean?

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.714
Oh, it means that you, uh

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:25.402
think your an awesome karate dude
that can do anything,

01:03:25.403 --> 01:03:27.478
and I'm an incompetent schmuck.

01:03:27.479 --> 01:03:29.954
Who needs a gun that shoots farts at people.
That's what that means.

01:03:30.128 --> 01:03:32.267
I'm just saying, we should do this together.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:33.791
I'm just saying, you should go home.

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:36.425
You should go to sleep, so tomorrow you could process...

01:03:36.426 --> 01:03:38.470
MY incredible plan.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.491
Fine.

01:03:43.996 --> 01:03:45.538
This is so stupid.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.597
We've pissed this guy off.

01:03:47.598 --> 01:03:49.980
Now we are walking into a meeting on his turf.

01:03:49.981 --> 01:03:51.696
We walked into their turf last time.

01:03:51.697 --> 01:03:54.244
And guess what?
We kicked the living crap out of them.

01:03:54.245 --> 01:03:57.270
And, everyone knows what happens
when you fool with a Hornet.

01:03:57.429 --> 01:03:58.912
You get stung.

01:03:58.913 --> 01:04:00.541
You get stung, what does that mean?

01:04:00.783 --> 01:04:02.308
It's not a game, Britt.

01:04:02.545 --> 01:04:04.563
And you are going to get us killed.

01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:07.997
If you don't like my plan,
you do not have to be a part of it.

01:04:07.998 --> 01:04:09.446
I don't even think you have a plan.

01:04:09.447 --> 01:04:11.683
I do have a plan, I just haven't told it to you yet.

01:04:11.684 --> 01:04:12.710
And it's amazing.

01:04:12.711 --> 01:04:16.921
Okay? So are you in?
Or are you chickening out like a, bitch?

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:18.192
You are a bitch.

01:04:18.193 --> 01:04:20.088
Not now, Kato. Not now, turn in here.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.119
To there, game faces Kato, game faces.

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:33.169
Here's the plan. You take this thing, you put it in your ear.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.794
You listen in on my phone,
which I've taped on my chest.

01:04:35.795 --> 01:04:37.758
See, when I say the secret word,

01:04:37.759 --> 01:04:39.732
which is 'Constantinople'.

01:04:39.733 --> 01:04:42.724
I'll kick Yoda in the nuts,
you blow them up with the missiles.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:47.268
Whoa! Turn, get back, go, go. Okay.

01:04:49.982 --> 01:04:51.487
This is not part of the plan.

01:04:51.515 --> 01:04:52.632
We're sandwiched.

01:05:04.256 --> 01:05:07.648
And so, thunder strikes lightly.

01:05:11.778 --> 01:05:13.008
Don't get all panicky.

01:05:14.832 --> 01:05:17.272
The worst thing we can do right now is panic.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:18.725
Just let me think.

01:05:25.278 --> 01:05:27.814
Okay, don't worry. I'll get us out of here, okay.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.722
Not to worry, we'll get it done, asswipe.

01:05:30.723 --> 01:05:33.395
Well with that attitude we will come out, man.

01:05:38.498 --> 01:05:39.561
I'm getting claustiphobic, Kato.

01:05:39.562 --> 01:05:40.807
Okay, let me think.

01:05:40.808 --> 01:05:43.058
-Oh, no. I can't breath.
-Listen, listen.

01:05:47.473 --> 01:05:49.463
We're buried, we are totally buried.

01:05:49.464 --> 01:05:51.020
Okay, okay.

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:52.355
What are you doing?

01:05:53.038 --> 01:05:55.146
I am killing us, or saving us.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:58.480
Whoa, whoa, missiles armed.
That's your plan?

01:05:58.481 --> 01:05:59.896
You're going to blow us up, Kato.

01:05:59.897 --> 01:06:02.269
That's not a good plan, disarm them, man.

01:06:02.682 --> 01:06:03.826
Shall we part?

01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:06.857
Would you save those bombs for me.

01:06:18.369 --> 01:06:19.369
Chili!

01:06:20.694 --> 01:06:22.856
They killed him. They killed Chili.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.483
Lets fly.

01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:33.261
Let's run.

01:06:42.487 --> 01:06:43.487
There's thorns in these bushes. Stop.

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:50.485
This thing has no aim.

01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:52.726
-That sucks.
-You have no aim.

01:06:56.196 --> 01:06:57.196
Watch!

01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:05.835
What?

01:07:15.283 --> 01:07:17.774
I smash window, you shoot in.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.452
Every man for himself.

01:07:28.207 --> 01:07:29.207
No way.

01:07:30.837 --> 01:07:31.837
DIE!

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.132
Shit!

01:07:56.845 --> 01:07:59.024
So you're just going to ignore me now?
Is that it?

01:07:59.587 --> 01:08:00.854
Like a baby.

01:08:01.486 --> 01:08:03.592
Go home and eat some baby food, maybe.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.560
Drink some milk.

01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:08.093
Why don't you talk like a baby. Mama, goo goo.

01:08:08.094 --> 01:08:09.094
You baby.

01:08:14.128 --> 01:08:17.505
Wahhh, wahhh.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:18.509
Baby!

01:08:20.953 --> 01:08:24.298
Somehow explosions was triggered from that vehicle.

01:08:24.299 --> 01:08:27.209
-Destroying it but ...
-Dick weed.

01:08:28.223 --> 01:08:29.845
Okay, you're calling me that too, now.

01:08:29.846 --> 01:08:33.191
I know people call me that. That's not a
surprise to me, that's not a mystery, okay.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:37.040
Well, you say the real thing to me
all day, every day.

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.620
It's not a partners word.

01:08:38.621 --> 01:08:39.758
We are not partners.

01:08:39.759 --> 01:08:42.122
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick.

01:08:42.406 --> 01:08:43.836
That's what this is.

01:08:43.926 --> 01:08:46.017
I'm Indie, you're Short Round.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.470
Simon...Garfunkle.

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.978
Scooby...Do.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:53.913
Stop fooling yourself. The Green Hornet
is nothing without me.

01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:55.720
I made the knock out gas.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.816
I alone designed and build the Black Beauty.

01:08:57.889 --> 01:08:59.890
And I didn't help, at all?

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:02.776
-How, ejector seats?
-Exactly.

01:09:03.115 --> 01:09:04.390
What a great idea.

01:09:04.831 --> 01:09:07.277
You may have started this Green Hornet thing.

01:09:07.505 --> 01:09:09.912
Because of how much you hated your father.

01:09:10.504 --> 01:09:12.194
-You're an egomaniac.
-I know.

01:09:13.339 --> 01:09:14.926
Exactly like your father.

01:09:15.221 --> 01:09:19.658
You are a jealous, pathetic little man.

01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:21.162
-Fine.
-Yeah.

01:09:21.162 --> 01:09:22.569
You're doing great with Lenore.

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:24.042
What the hell does that mean?

01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:26.551
Ah, don't you walk away on that.

01:09:26.706 --> 01:09:29.849
What? You're charming her pants off?
That's what I'm suppose to believe.

01:09:31.794 --> 01:09:34.060
No, that is a filthy gesture.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.117
You know I like her.
I confided in you, Kato.

01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:38.803
I, I trusted you.

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.265
I told you I liked her.

01:09:40.267 --> 01:09:42.215
You hit on everything that moves.

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.877
I'm amazed, you haven't hit on me yet.

01:09:47.596 --> 01:09:49.746
If you keep talking like this, Kato.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:51.801
I'm going to beat the living shit out of you.

01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:52.801
Just so you know.

01:09:52.801 --> 01:09:54.606
I like to see you try.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:56.279
You're a yuppie whimp,

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.846
and I'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.931
You grew up penis-less on the streets.

01:10:02.548 --> 01:10:03.548
Funny.

01:10:03.549 --> 01:10:05.554
Heroes beat sidekicks.

01:10:05.555 --> 01:10:06.960
-Period.
-Don't do that.

01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:08.415
-Don't do what? Don't poke you.
-I'm warning you.

01:10:13.546 --> 01:10:16.878
Okay. I'm done, forget that stuff,
so we can fix this.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.693
Okay, okay you're right.

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:20.578
You're right.
Let's talk.

01:10:20.579 --> 01:10:21.587
I'm sorry.

01:10:23.772 --> 01:10:26.266
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato.

01:10:31.466 --> 01:10:32.466
Come here.

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:38.653
You like that, Kato. You like that.

01:10:39.285 --> 01:10:41.752
You get stung when playing with a Hornet.

01:10:43.318 --> 01:10:44.318
Oh, god.

01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:52.635
Now I'm the guy that hurt you.

01:10:52.636 --> 01:10:54.280
I'd like to see you try.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.135
I can't see with this thing on.

01:11:07.067 --> 01:11:08.821
You barely touched her.

01:11:22.957 --> 01:11:25.039
I'll give you a touch.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.060
Okay, let's...

01:11:28.514 --> 01:11:29.921
You end this?

01:11:36.343 --> 01:11:37.862
You are so stubborn.

01:11:53.707 --> 01:11:57.179
-How it feel, you don't like it?
-No I don't like it.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.870
-You like it.
-No, I don't like it, get off.

01:12:07.005 --> 01:12:09.991
Okay, now we can end this.

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:16.028
Stop, just stop. Just stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:12:24.156 --> 01:12:25.156
Reid!

01:12:25.896 --> 01:12:26.896
Wait.

01:12:29.067 --> 01:12:30.067
Help.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:33.115
Help.

01:12:41.917 --> 01:12:43.469
Get out of the pool.

01:12:45.037 --> 01:12:46.694
Get off my property.

01:12:48.306 --> 01:12:50.032
Never come back.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.037
Help.

01:12:52.174 --> 01:12:54.227
I, can't swim.

01:13:01.364 --> 01:13:03.265
Please....Reid.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:28.737
Lenore, it's me.

01:13:29.512 --> 01:13:30.512
It's me, Kato.

01:13:31.812 --> 01:13:34.715
-What the hell?
-That's for whatever lie you told Britt.

01:13:35.405 --> 01:13:37.942
He called me a skank and was mean to me,
and then he fired me.

01:13:41.145 --> 01:13:43.164
Chili was a fine warrior.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.140
He was a man of honor and dignity.

01:13:48.448 --> 01:13:50.352
We must show our respect.

01:13:51.376 --> 01:13:53.445
I'm will assure him blood.

01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:56.249
Popeye, go forth.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.706
Take these words and spread them.

01:13:59.476 --> 01:14:02.158
The bounty of one million dollars.

01:14:02.575 --> 01:14:05.241
The prey, The Green Hornet.

01:14:05.469 --> 01:14:07.218
Dead, if possible.

01:14:07.613 --> 01:14:10.066
Alive, if necessary.

01:14:10.068 --> 01:14:13.818
I don't care where they have to
go, or who they have to do.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:16.020
I want the head of The Green Hornet,

01:14:16.021 --> 01:14:17.537
and I want it tonight.

01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:20.292
Yes.

01:14:29.785 --> 01:14:32.485
Everybody, chase the Hornet.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.879
-We want him dead.
-Right.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.695
I want to ... on your own life.

01:14:43.927 --> 01:14:44.927
The Masked one.

01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:46.914
-Kill green, yeah.
-Go.

01:14:49.949 --> 01:14:52.643
-Kill the masked one.
-Get on the horn.

01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:55.954
-Alright I'll do it.

01:14:58.344 --> 01:15:01.161
-This Green Hornet, got a mask on.
-One million dollars.

01:15:02.389 --> 01:15:04.437
-Got it.
-Right.

01:15:09.857 --> 01:15:13.499
(All talking on getting The Green Hornet.)

01:15:33.836 --> 01:15:37.240
You failed to kill me the Hornet, Popeye.

01:15:44.489 --> 01:15:46.274
I warned you about this.

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:50.853
You heightened this thing to a point where
it had to reach some kind of climax.

01:15:51.302 --> 01:15:53.267
Well, here it is.

01:15:55.959 --> 01:15:59.092
I hope you realize now,
you should stay out of my way.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.214
Never run this paper.

01:16:07.232 --> 01:16:12.786
A gruesome scene last night as bodies were found all
across the city. Everyone of them wearing green clothing.

01:16:16.509 --> 01:16:19.152
D. A. Scanlon's office, please.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:24.748
The victims were unfamiliar, and it seems their only connection
was in fact their choice of attire.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.614
As a safety precaution, police are advising citizens...

01:16:27.615 --> 01:16:32.224
to avoid wearing the color green.
So as not to be unwittingly targeted.

01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:37.131
This is my fault.
This is what I did with this newspaper.

01:16:37.132 --> 01:16:40.643
So what. At least you tried.
Your Dad would have understood that.

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.745
Look, running a newspaper must be difficult.

01:16:43.746 --> 01:16:49.083
I mean, if it's anything like running a re-election
campaign. It's got to be a pain in the ass.

01:16:50.287 --> 01:16:52.056
Fortunately I think, uh...

01:16:52.688 --> 01:16:54.510
think we make each other's life easier.

01:16:55.266 --> 01:16:57.869
-How?
-Well there are two sides to every story.

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:01.044
Right.
I mean, there's some people, they see an event.

01:17:01.045 --> 01:17:04.484
And they interpret it as this crime war, you know.

01:17:04.485 --> 01:17:09.093
Other people see the same incident
and the interpreter it as a small isolated event.

01:17:09.094 --> 01:17:11.889
-Yeah.
-I guess, I could...

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.492
help you decide.

01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:16.561
How these incidents are exposed.

01:17:16.721 --> 01:17:18.456
In the public interest, of course.

01:17:18.457 --> 01:17:22.943
Now if this collaboration leads
to ascertain my position.

01:17:22.944 --> 01:17:28.667
Well I will insure that you
enjoy compensation in return.

01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:32.016
What kind of compensation?

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.229
Frank, are you...

01:17:35.808 --> 01:17:39.041
are you like saying you want me
to slight up the news for you?

01:17:39.142 --> 01:17:41.021
For your re-election. Is that what this is?

01:17:41.022 --> 01:17:42.244
I thought you needed my help.

01:17:42.346 --> 01:17:44.997
We, help each other out.

01:17:45.064 --> 01:17:47.073
So that we can both get ahead.

01:17:47.728 --> 01:17:50.002
This is mutually beneficial.

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.921
Okay, I get it now.

01:17:53.731 --> 01:17:57.727
You went to my Dad, he rejected your offer.
And you feel you can just push me around.

01:17:58.514 --> 01:18:00.540
That's what this is? That's what you think?

01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:05.418
No, what I think is that you
over value your Dad's integrity.

01:18:07.539 --> 01:18:10.459
You get out of my office right this second.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.572
This might be what you're looking for.

01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:18.578
Thank you.

01:18:48.906 --> 01:18:49.906
Boss.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:53.584
What are you doing up here? All
the guys were waiting for you.

01:18:53.585 --> 01:18:55.447
Come here.

01:18:56.542 --> 01:18:58.006
I've been doing some thinking.

01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:00.664
And I had a revelation.

01:19:01.099 --> 01:19:03.213
What, I'm obsolete.

01:19:03.214 --> 01:19:04.331
I'm a dinosaur.

01:19:04.802 --> 01:19:07.363
Not in the scary way, in the extinct way.

01:19:07.393 --> 01:19:09.246
And it's time for changes.

01:19:09.342 --> 01:19:13.966
You know, it's time for me to
gain some.....charisma.

01:19:14.642 --> 01:19:16.958
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:19:16.958 --> 01:19:20.882
-What?
-Ha, ha. I'm talking about a motif.

01:19:20.883 --> 01:19:21.963
A theme.

01:19:21.964 --> 01:19:23.132
A  mask.

01:19:23.172 --> 01:19:24.932
Perhaps a stylish cape.

01:19:25.247 --> 01:19:30.439
I'm talking about the death of 'Chudnofsky'
and the rebirth of 'Bloodnofsky'.

01:19:31.846 --> 01:19:32.846
What do you say?

01:19:35.097 --> 01:19:37.366
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:42.813
I think that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:44.989
Why is that stupid?

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.583
That's not stupid.

01:19:46.584 --> 01:19:49.384
-Yes it is.
-Blood-nof-sky.

01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:52.603
I...I was going to wear red.

01:19:52.836 --> 01:19:54.351
For blood, get it?

01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:56.470
That's scary.

01:19:56.928 --> 01:19:58.145
And cool.

01:19:58.745 --> 01:19:59.745
Get this.

01:20:00.698 --> 01:20:04.593
"Be it my mask or blood,
red will be the last color you'll ever see".

01:20:06.898 --> 01:20:08.813
I say that to people when I kill them.

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:11.562
The Green Hornet killed Chili.

01:20:11.656 --> 01:20:14.149
I am minus an eyeball, here.

01:20:14.335 --> 01:20:18.422
You can't go and tell these guys that.
They'll think you lost your bloody mind.

01:20:18.852 --> 01:20:21.115
I think you're having a midlife crisis here.

01:20:21.435 --> 01:20:23.265
Seriously, you're starting to scare me.

01:20:25.699 --> 01:20:26.991
Want to know a secret?

01:20:27.867 --> 01:20:29.864
I'm starting to scare myself.

01:20:36.895 --> 01:20:37.895
Gentlemen.

01:20:38.421 --> 01:20:41.198
The reign of Bloodnofsky starts tonight.

01:20:48.086 --> 01:20:49.086
Hey.

01:20:49.087 --> 01:20:50.772
-Get out of here!
-I'm sorry,

01:20:50.773 --> 01:20:52.714
What are you doing, seriously.

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:54.467
Look, please. Just listen to me.

01:20:54.468 --> 01:20:56.432
Kato lied about us, okay.

01:20:56.433 --> 01:20:58.821
You should have found that out
before you just go and fire me.

01:20:58.822 --> 01:20:59.822
-Nothing happened?
-No.

01:21:00.282 --> 01:21:03.549
Oh thank god. I knew it,
I knew nothing happened.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:04.718
That ass.

01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:05.934
He said you did this.

01:21:05.935 --> 01:21:06.969
What, what is that?

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:08.393
-I don't know, but I knew it was a lie.
-That's disgusting.

01:21:08.394 --> 01:21:11.752
It's gross. That's not why I'm here, look.
I need you to come back and work for me.

01:21:11.753 --> 01:21:13.491
I'll do whatever you want, I'll double your salary.

01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:15.595
Please, things at the Sentinel?

01:21:15.596 --> 01:21:16.999
Not what they seem.

01:21:17.087 --> 01:21:22.037
As soon as Scanlon started running for election,
my father stopped printing news about hard crime.

01:21:22.037 --> 01:21:23.787
He was making Scanlon look good.

01:21:23.788 --> 01:21:26.463
And I, I have to make it right.

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:29.775
And I realized that if I want to do what's best.

01:21:29.776 --> 01:21:34.296
For this world, that the Daily Sentinel
is the most responsible way to do that.

01:21:34.297 --> 01:21:35.488
Now here's the problem.

01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:39.423
I don't know anything about journalism

01:21:39.424 --> 01:21:40.423
That's the truth.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.135
I need somebody that does.

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:46.554
I need someone that I can trust with my life.

01:21:46.556 --> 01:21:50.769
Just...okay? I need someone who is you.
I need you.

01:21:51.746 --> 01:21:53.943
Will you please help me?

01:21:57.011 --> 01:21:58.783
Britt, I..uh.

01:21:59.239 --> 01:22:00.904
I know, I know.

01:22:01.593 --> 01:22:03.316
Oh my god!

01:22:06.194 --> 01:22:07.567
What is your problem?

01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:09.809
-God!
-Why did you do that to me?

01:22:09.946 --> 01:22:11.581
Because you tried to kiss me.

01:22:11.582 --> 01:22:12.918
Yeah, we were going to make out.

01:22:12.919 --> 01:22:14.133
No we weren't.

01:22:14.134 --> 01:22:15.925
Well then I guess I owe you an apology.

01:22:15.926 --> 01:22:18.258
-'Cause I misread that.
-As usual.

01:22:18.259 --> 01:22:19.357
Okay, look.

01:22:19.623 --> 01:22:21.500
I'm sorry, I didn't plan on kissing you.

01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:24.089
When I said all that I mean it.
Will you come back and work for me, please?

01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.525
-Pretty please.
-Double my salary.

01:22:26.923 --> 01:22:28.847
And I want a parking spot.

01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:30.084
You don't have a parking spot?

01:22:30.085 --> 01:22:31.422
-No.
-Wow, that sucks.

01:22:31.423 --> 01:22:34.863
And if you ever so much
as look at my ass again.

01:22:34.864 --> 01:22:36.126
I can't even see your ass.

01:22:36.478 --> 01:22:39.658
I will sue you for sexual harassment.
Do you understand?

01:22:40.301 --> 01:22:41.301
Hugs?

01:22:41.305 --> 01:22:43.114
Where's the hugs at, ya all?

01:23:12.447 --> 01:23:14.897
-Britt Reid's office.
-Frank Scanlon.

01:23:14.898 --> 01:23:16.304
Oh, please hold.

01:23:16.888 --> 01:23:18.235
D.A. Scanlon

01:23:18.236 --> 01:23:20.087
-Really?
-Yes.

01:23:21.502 --> 01:23:24.161
-Hello.
-Hey Britt, it's Scanlon.

01:23:24.162 --> 01:23:25.691
Uh, listen.

01:23:25.692 --> 01:23:27.422
I think I owe you an apology.

01:23:38.092 --> 01:23:40.028
Too much blood in the gutter.

01:23:40.029 --> 01:23:42.002
You win. Let's split L.A.

01:23:42.003 --> 01:23:43.860
You get the L. I get the A.

01:23:43.861 --> 01:23:46.203
That means we share the gold and the work.

01:23:52.072 --> 01:23:54.546
One million dollars for today.

01:23:55.048 --> 01:23:58.620
Um, I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from, there.

01:23:58.621 --> 01:24:00.426
I'd just like a chance to clarify some things.

01:24:00.427 --> 01:24:01.897
Things are pretty clear, Scanlon.

01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:04.986
I got three words for you.
Suck it you dick face.

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:08.009
You're gonna tell him you want to meet him.
This is journalism, okay.

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:11.430
You want to be an investigative report, what
you have to do is investigate.

01:24:11.431 --> 01:24:13.040
-Tell him that you want to meet him,
-Hello?

01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:15.189
Okay, your right, okay.

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:16.194
Watch this.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:25.296
I was joking. Uh, yeah, uh why don't we get
together and just talk about things.

01:24:25.297 --> 01:24:26.621
That's probably a good idea, okay?

01:24:26.622 --> 01:24:29.611
Why don't we meet up for dinner,
a little place called 'Gonpachi'.

01:24:29.612 --> 01:24:32.599
Hibachi, a nice little place on
La Cienega drive, around 8:30.

01:24:37.279 --> 01:24:39.741
La Cienega, 8:30.

01:25:19.277 --> 01:25:20.277
Britt!

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:33.831
-Hey, Frank.
-Hi, Britt.

01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:36.233
-Good to see you.
-I'm having a sake, what are you having?

01:25:36.503 --> 01:25:38.451
Yeah, I'll have some sake, sure.

01:25:40.546 --> 01:25:42.167
Well, thanks for coming, Britt.

01:25:42.492 --> 01:25:43.492
No problem.

01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:17.089
Mr. Chudnofsky.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.580
Bloodnofsky.
Blood-nofsky.

01:26:19.798 --> 01:26:21.726
I commissioned The Green Hornet.

01:26:21.727 --> 01:26:22.728
You're the chauffeur.

01:26:23.842 --> 01:26:26.269
-Partner.
-Where's the Hornet?

01:26:27.202 --> 01:26:28.212
Right there.

01:26:30.839 --> 01:26:32.838
Whoa, we only get half of the team?

01:26:32.839 --> 01:26:34.217
Who says you're the good half?

01:26:38.970 --> 01:26:40.561
Where's Reid?

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:41.693
Guess.

01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:44.450
Oh.

01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:46.108
Any of you move.

01:26:46.359 --> 01:26:47.446
You're dead.

01:26:48.886 --> 01:26:50.724
I'm not actually here for forgiveness, Britt.

01:26:50.945 --> 01:26:52.543
What the hell. I don't understand.

01:26:52.544 --> 01:26:55.522
Yeah, you understand nothing.
So I'm going to explain it you very simply.

01:26:56.119 --> 01:26:59.739
If you ever come across any
article regarding a major crime?

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.584
A man named Benjamin Chudnofsky.

01:27:01.585 --> 01:27:03.924
Or anything that makes this city think,

01:27:03.925 --> 01:27:07.219
that I'm not the fine line protecting the light from the darkness.

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.633
You're going to bring it to me.

01:27:08.634 --> 01:27:10.289
You're going to bring it to me,

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:14.290
and I'm going to tell you whether it's okay
for you to print in your stupid little newspaper.

01:27:16.452 --> 01:27:18.062
That's how I did it with your dad.

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.026
And that's how you and I are going to do it.

01:27:23.559 --> 01:27:26.929
Scanlon, you're saying you want
me to let you write the news?

01:27:29.787 --> 01:27:30.978
Finally.

01:27:31.484 --> 01:27:32.971
You understand.

01:27:34.774 --> 01:27:37.252
Yep, I understand all right.

01:27:38.201 --> 01:27:39.744
Here's one I understand.

01:27:39.745 --> 01:27:42.581
That you son, just got played.

01:27:43.044 --> 01:27:44.866
By a player.

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.100
Recording device, USB.

01:27:47.101 --> 01:27:48.970
No, you can't have it. It's mine.

01:27:48.971 --> 01:27:50.419
You stupid schmuck.

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.396
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.

01:27:52.397 --> 01:27:54.387
I run a newspaper, genius.

01:27:54.388 --> 01:27:56.242
This is going on the front page tomorrow.

01:27:56.243 --> 01:27:58.367
-Oh yeah. I got to say that's kind of impressed with this.
-You should say it was impressive.

01:27:58.368 --> 01:27:59.746
But it's not going to do you any good.

01:27:59.747 --> 01:28:02.713
How could it not do me any good?
Are you going to kill me in the middle of this restaurant?

01:28:02.714 --> 01:28:05.521
-Yes.
-What, you're going to murder me?

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:08.372
Yeah.
Like I murdered your father.

01:28:09.012 --> 01:28:10.378
What's that, my Dad was not murdered.

01:28:10.379 --> 01:28:12.421
He, he died from a bee sting.

01:28:12.422 --> 01:28:15.503
No, no. Your father died from an overdose of epitoxin.

01:28:15.504 --> 01:28:16.836
Most commonly found in a bee sting.

01:28:16.837 --> 01:28:18.187
In which he also happened to be allergic to.

01:28:18.188 --> 01:28:19.932
Britt, that epitoxin,...

01:28:21.245 --> 01:28:22.916
was administered by me.

01:28:25.336 --> 01:28:26.752
Shit!

01:28:26.753 --> 01:28:27.753
Think Britt.

01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:29.933
You can figure this out, my son.

01:28:30.151 --> 01:28:31.300
You're brilliant.

01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:33.131
I am so stunned.

01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:35.667
That's right, think.

01:28:36.022 --> 01:28:37.346
-Slowly..
-Okay.

01:28:37.347 --> 01:28:39.850
Two years ago Scanlon decides to run for D.A.

01:28:39.911 --> 01:28:42.422
He goes on the platform that
he's cleaning up the street of L.A.

01:28:42.723 --> 01:28:43.845
Which is impossible.

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:46.209
So, he asks the media to slight the news.

01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:48.836
-And you go along with it, like everyone else?
-No.

01:28:48.881 --> 01:28:50.793
I, I refused.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.617
So he...shit what does he do?

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.523
So Scanlon decides to go really dirty,
he makes a pact with a criminal.

01:28:56.608 --> 01:28:59.010
Chudnofsky kills the reporter Verbi,...Vertolli?

01:28:59.011 --> 01:29:02.244
I didn't want anymore bloodshed.
So I stopped reporting on crime.

01:29:02.245 --> 01:29:06.167
To be honest in the last few years, this
paper has dipped in quality and ambition.

01:29:06.643 --> 01:29:09.063
Now, Scanlon can hold up his part of the deal,

01:29:09.064 --> 01:29:10.469
of keeping the media under control and...

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.293
Chudnofsky can do whatever he wants.

01:29:14.275 --> 01:29:16.055
But Chudnofsky had a different plan.

01:29:16.568 --> 01:29:19.428
He wanted to take over all the gangs of L.A.

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:21.847
So that's when you decided to cut the strings.

01:29:22.412 --> 01:29:24.286
I couldn't look myself in the mirror.

01:29:24.653 --> 01:29:27.185
I hated every word I said
to you that morning, Britt.

01:29:27.985 --> 01:29:30.121
So you start reporting on crime again.

01:29:30.122 --> 01:29:33.604
And now Scanlon is a dead man unless he
proves he's still under control.

01:29:33.973 --> 01:29:36.905
He has no choice but to organize
a secret meeting with you.

01:29:37.855 --> 01:29:39.306
And he kills you himself.

01:29:41.264 --> 01:29:44.455
In the end, you stood up for what's right, Dad.

01:29:45.424 --> 01:29:47.127
Now I have to do the same.

01:29:51.067 --> 01:29:55.092
I can see by that stupid expression you've
got on your face for the past five minutes,

01:29:55.093 --> 01:29:56.377
That you're trying to piece this together.

01:29:56.378 --> 01:29:57.496
But it's no good.

01:29:57.782 --> 01:29:59.897
You're about to killed by the, Green Hornet.

01:30:00.712 --> 01:30:01.712
What?

01:30:06.346 --> 01:30:07.567
It's the Green Hornet's sidekick.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.806
He's got a gun.

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:14.733
Bluff! Bluff! Eradicate.

01:30:18.135 --> 01:30:20.460
Before you do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.

01:30:21.226 --> 01:30:22.655
I'm sorry for everything.

01:30:23.797 --> 01:30:25.223
I forgive you.

01:30:30.106 --> 01:30:31.873
Hey, not me. Him stupid.

01:30:31.965 --> 01:30:34.078
Confused, you should be.

01:30:35.247 --> 01:30:37.010
-Go, go.
-Let's go..

01:30:47.762 --> 01:30:49.114
We're goners.

01:30:49.725 --> 01:30:51.877
You know what happen when you fool with a hornet?

01:30:51.878 --> 01:30:53.478
-No.
-You get stung.

01:30:55.903 --> 01:30:56.903
Oh, shit.

01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:06.140
See, the bad guys.

01:31:08.389 --> 01:31:09.389
Go, go!

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.533
-What the hell happened?
-Get in the car.

01:31:16.534 --> 01:31:19.521
-He was suppose to kill Britt Reid, he’s shooting at me.
-Get in the vehicle.

01:31:31.259 --> 01:31:32.259
Are you okay?

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.134
-Britt?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

01:31:34.398 --> 01:31:35.822
My outfit's back here.

01:31:38.778 --> 01:31:40.892
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet.

01:31:40.893 --> 01:31:43.295
Yeah I know. You hired a guy to kill himself.

01:31:46.358 --> 01:31:50.457
Britt Reid recorded the whole
conversation on some Sushi drive USB.

01:31:50.458 --> 01:31:53.598
-We can't loose him.
-We're not loosing him, we're following him.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.041
Kato, thank you buddy.
You were so good, thank you.

01:31:57.042 --> 01:31:58.770
-Really?
-Yes..

01:31:58.771 --> 01:32:00.070
-Your house?
-No.

01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:01.097
Here's the deal, Kato.

01:32:01.185 --> 01:32:04.828
We've got to get this flash drive to the Sentinel.
It's got Scanlon spilling-the-beans on it.

01:32:04.829 --> 01:32:06.623
We're going to put it on the net.

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:08.105
It's what my father would have wanted.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:09.195
You like your father, now?

01:32:09.547 --> 01:32:12.378
Yes, you see he wasn't a dick after all.

01:32:12.534 --> 01:32:14.362
Well, he was a dick.

01:32:14.363 --> 01:32:16.166
Just not really how we thought he was.

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.895
At the end he wasn't a dick...it's called gay.
I'll explain later, okay.

01:32:20.304 --> 01:32:22.377
It's a lot of conflicting emotions, Kato.

01:32:22.378 --> 01:32:23.746
Let's roll, Reid.

01:32:32.893 --> 01:32:36.556
Here’s' the thing, Kato. Honestly, I've
been jealous of you the entire time.

01:32:36.643 --> 01:32:37.831
-You're awesome.
-I know.

01:32:37.832 --> 01:32:39.188
-You built this whole car.
-I know.

01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:40.189
You know karate.

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:41.902
-You're charming.
-Thank you.

01:32:41.903 --> 01:32:43.659
These guys are amazingly well organized.

01:32:58.255 --> 01:32:59.678
Backups on the side.

01:33:00.527 --> 01:33:02.926
-Orders.
-Put your guard on, here.

01:33:08.773 --> 01:33:10.062
The other side.

01:33:11.655 --> 01:33:12.655
Your turn!

01:33:27.254 --> 01:33:28.254
Oh shit.

01:33:31.217 --> 01:33:32.217
We lost them.

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:33.232
-He's gone. ...He's gone.
-Yeah.

01:33:35.674 --> 01:33:37.103
Damn, he's back.

01:33:37.105 --> 01:33:38.310
You gotta be kidding me.

01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:40.133
These guys are good.

01:33:41.257 --> 01:33:42.907
Over there.
Over there, over there.

01:33:43.179 --> 01:33:44.375
I got moment.

01:33:44.376 --> 01:33:45.588
Moment to this.

01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:47.146
We're not going to make it.

01:33:47.348 --> 01:33:48.872
Waa...yeah we're going to make it.

01:34:02.671 --> 01:34:04.259
That's a very big gun.

01:34:16.565 --> 01:34:18.502
Kato, be careful.

01:34:19.848 --> 01:34:21.734
-Take the wheel.
-What?

01:34:21.735 --> 01:34:23.327
-Take the wheel.
-I can't drive this thing.

01:34:23.328 --> 01:34:24.327
Yes you can.

01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:26.804
Nun chucks, that was my idea.

01:34:27.036 --> 01:34:28.324
Hey, hey where you going?

01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.234
What are you doing now?
What are you doing up there?

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:51.875
Shit, shit!

01:34:52.292 --> 01:34:55.348
Kato, Jesus.
I don't know what anything does.

01:34:55.693 --> 01:34:57.437
Why didn't you do this in English?

01:35:05.237 --> 01:35:07.492
-(Speaks Chinese)
-Why don't you say it in English.

01:35:07.493 --> 01:35:09.181
-No, sir.
-It's out there.

01:35:09.413 --> 01:35:11.992
-Hang one left.
-I'm just ready to ...

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.264
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:35:14.265 --> 01:35:15.264
Turn it off.

01:35:15.265 --> 01:35:16.789
-I don't know what to do.
-Turn off.

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:17.880
I'll just stop it.

01:35:17.881 --> 01:35:19.663
Ah, I stopped it.

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.518
I'm sorry.

01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:30.939
-Shoot foam
-Hey, it's okay.

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.385
Next time, don't touch anything.

01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.933
Kato, look.

01:35:37.045 --> 01:35:38.045
We made it.

01:35:38.193 --> 01:35:39.467
Kato, we made it.

01:35:39.468 --> 01:35:40.656
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

01:35:40.909 --> 01:35:42.701
-I can't.
-Yeah, that's cool.

01:35:50.313 --> 01:35:51.417
Oh, we're screwed.

01:36:13.238 --> 01:36:15.041
Come on! Hurry up.

01:36:18.302 --> 01:36:19.302
Ah,  whoops.

01:36:23.221 --> 01:36:25.574
-Did you drop it?... Shit!
-Yes.

01:36:30.283 --> 01:36:31.283
You get it. I'll cover you.

01:36:32.846 --> 01:36:34.219
Wish me luck.

01:36:35.086 --> 01:36:36.258
Good luck.

01:36:59.607 --> 01:37:03.540
Dear Hornet, Be it my mask, or your blood.

01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:06.034
Red will be the last...

01:37:07.402 --> 01:37:10.150
Britt Reid, fire.

01:37:14.479 --> 01:37:16.458
Go!
Get him.

01:37:19.088 --> 01:37:20.566
Let me shoot him.

01:37:22.385 --> 01:37:23.505
Oh, no.

01:37:25.453 --> 01:37:26.801
Shoot to kill.

01:37:28.574 --> 01:37:30.004
You brought a gas mask.

01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:33.214
-Of course I brought a gas mask.
-Just for yourself.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.171
There!

01:38:05.456 --> 01:38:07.045
Are you hitting the paper?

01:38:13.725 --> 01:38:14.820
Over here.

01:38:19.866 --> 01:38:21.645
This fog's up.

01:38:30.788 --> 01:38:31.788
There.

01:38:39.254 --> 01:38:40.254
Kato!

01:38:42.143 --> 01:38:43.583
Get us out of here.

01:38:51.448 --> 01:38:53.449
Hah, I'm ungassable.

01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:10.700
That was incredibly dangerous.

01:39:12.417 --> 01:39:14.982
Drop me off at the elevators.
I'll take it from here.

01:39:20.066 --> 01:39:21.518
No, we stay together.

01:39:28.353 --> 01:39:29.756
Hey, get in the front seat.

01:39:29.757 --> 01:39:30.763
Quick, quick.

01:39:40.877 --> 01:39:42.658
Tenth floor, tenth floor.

01:39:42.883 --> 01:39:44.182
What's the worse, what's the worse, missiles?

01:39:44.183 --> 01:39:46.360
Four missiles left. Hornet gun?

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.566
-Check.
-Machine guns, check.

01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:49.751
Does it drive?

01:39:49.752 --> 01:39:51.049
Front wheel drive.

01:39:57.879 --> 01:39:59.081
Hey, get out of here.

01:40:04.846 --> 01:40:06.501
Okay, you can let me out of here.

01:40:12.203 --> 01:40:14.198
Bazooka. Guy with a bazooka.

01:40:16.888 --> 01:40:17.888
Missile.

01:40:18.117 --> 01:40:19.117
Fire.

01:40:28.938 --> 01:40:29.938
Reload.

01:40:34.562 --> 01:40:35.685
Kato, they're here.

01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:38.274
Go be a journalist, I'll kick ass.

01:40:38.571 --> 01:40:40.324
There, there!

01:40:40.393 --> 01:40:41.393
Aw, shit!

01:40:49.015 --> 01:40:50.015
Come on.

01:40:56.439 --> 01:40:57.698
Okay, I'm there.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.110
One minute and this baby is going to all over the wo...

01:41:04.552 --> 01:41:06.452
Star...star...start up!

01:41:16.246 --> 01:41:17.246
Yeah!

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320
Do you see him?

01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:57.977
I can't see anything.

01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:26.015
Oh, I'm so stupid!

01:42:36.899 --> 01:42:38.204
All right, Reid.

01:42:38.564 --> 01:42:40.235
Hand over the thing.

01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:42.691
You want it?
Go get it.

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:49.582
Where is it?
Where is it!

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.990
I am Bloodnofsky.

01:42:51.342 --> 01:42:53.773
I've killed a thousand before,
and I'll kill a thousand more.

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:04.654
Now tremble before your death.

01:43:04.898 --> 01:43:10.321
For be it my mask, or be it your blood. Red
will be the last color you ever see.

01:44:00.593 --> 01:44:01.593
Britt.

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:02.830
Britt!

01:44:15.014 --> 01:44:17.160
Hey! End of the road, Scanlon.

01:44:17.324 --> 01:44:18.770
Okay, okay.

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:19.986
Let's just calm down.

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:21.739
Hand over the sushi.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.206
Um, yeah, hand it over.

01:44:24.207 --> 01:44:25.716
We can talk about this.

01:44:25.717 --> 01:44:27.299
On the ground now.

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.854
-It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him.
-Get on the ground.

01:44:28.854 --> 01:44:29.856
Shoot him!

01:44:34.885 --> 01:44:36.411
Quick, quick.

01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:39.295
I'm District Attorney Mike Scanlon.

01:44:39.296 --> 01:44:41.414
That is the Green Hornet.

01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:49.065
Kato, I screwed up.

01:44:49.066 --> 01:44:51.013
Scanlon's going to get away, scott free.

01:44:51.306 --> 01:44:52.821
No he's not.

01:45:26.939 --> 01:45:28.986
Ow! Whoa!

01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:33.589
Holy shit.

01:45:34.276 --> 01:45:35.276
Ejector seats.

01:45:36.474 --> 01:45:37.567
You actually built them.

01:45:37.568 --> 01:45:39.221
It was a good idea.

01:45:43.197 --> 01:45:44.197
Wow.

01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:47.737
This is really scary

01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:51.770
A brutal high speed chase between the Green Hornet,

01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:55.994
and rival gang members has led to the Daily Sentinel

01:45:54.995 --> 01:45:57.655
-I called it.
-leaving a trail of demolished cars,

01:45:57.656 --> 01:45:58.989
and trucks in their path.

01:45:58.990 --> 01:46:01.285
Here's the story. We're on our way to a costume party.

01:46:01.608 --> 01:46:02.608
Okay.

01:46:03.376 --> 01:46:05.122
We gotta get out of our suits.

01:46:05.256 --> 01:46:06.969
Where the hell are we going to go?

01:46:08.975 --> 01:46:10.788
No one knows why the District Attorney..

01:46:14.921 --> 01:46:17.443
No, stop!
Stop, stop!

01:46:17.444 --> 01:46:18.444
Lenore!

01:46:18.445 --> 01:46:19.787
How do you guys know my name?

01:46:19.788 --> 01:46:20.787
-It's us.
-Kato.

01:46:20.945 --> 01:46:22.950
It's me, huh?

01:46:23.079 --> 01:46:24.732
You assholes!

01:46:25.271 --> 01:46:26.271
You assholes.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.116
What the hell are you doing dressed as criminals?

01:46:29.117 --> 01:46:31.488
-You're criminals my god.
-No we're not.

01:46:31.489 --> 01:46:32.655
We're helping people.

01:46:32.957 --> 01:46:37.108
Why did you ask me to do research on the
Green Hornet, when you are the Green Hornet?

01:46:37.181 --> 01:46:38.247
We don't know what we're doing.

01:46:38.248 --> 01:46:40.964
We need you to help us, don't you see.
You're the mastermind.

01:46:40.965 --> 01:46:41.964
What?

01:46:42.403 --> 01:46:44.613
This is the police.
Please open up.

01:46:44.614 --> 01:46:47.204
Please don't tell on us. We were trying
to be good people. Don't do this.

01:46:47.205 --> 01:46:48.574
-Think about it.
-Shut up!

01:46:49.519 --> 01:46:51.204
Hello officer, can I help you?

01:46:51.205 --> 01:46:52.978
We're looking for two masked men.

01:46:52.979 --> 01:46:54.934
-You seen anything?
-Yeah, of course.

01:46:55.598 --> 01:46:57.469
-Really?
-Yeah, they're all over the news.

01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:59.522
- All the time.
-All right.

01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:02.396
Well please report anything suspicious.

01:47:02.397 --> 01:47:03.396
Absolutely.

01:47:04.346 --> 01:47:07.190
You heartless stupid assholes.

01:47:07.191 --> 01:47:09.366
You kiss him.

01:47:09.525 --> 01:47:10.515
You kiss me.

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.803
We'll figure this out later, come on.

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:10.677
Don't kiss me.

01:47:12.771 --> 01:47:12.771
)All talking at once

01:47:12.823 --> 01:47:14.115
I don't kissed him.

01:47:14.116 --> 01:47:15.320
-We don't kiss.
-I have a bullet in me.

01:47:15.321 --> 01:47:18.270
You know I didn't kiss. You guys like kissing.
I don't see why.

01:47:19.329 --> 01:47:21.376
I've been shot in the shoulder.

01:47:21.664 --> 01:47:23.317
Well then go to the hospital.

01:47:23.357 --> 01:47:25.198
No! Don't you see.

01:47:25.315 --> 01:47:27.807
The police knows the Green Hornet was shot in the shoulder.

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:30.437
If I go to the hospital they'll know I'm the Green Hornet.

01:47:30.731 --> 01:47:32.368
Yeah you've been shot, eww.

01:47:32.748 --> 01:47:35.974
Here's what I need. I need a spatula
to bite down on and a knife.

01:47:35.975 --> 01:47:38.226
You gotta dig this bullet out of my meat.

01:47:38.639 --> 01:47:39.639
Do it!

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.649
I'm cold.

01:47:42.903 --> 01:47:44.322
It's deep inside me.

01:47:44.517 --> 01:47:45.500
Oh, God.

01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:48.412
-Spatula.
-Ah, okay, okay.

01:47:48.492 --> 01:47:50.362
-Make sure it's sterilized.
-What?

01:47:50.718 --> 01:47:53.382
Sterilize it. Please I don't want to get gangrene.

01:47:53.385 --> 01:47:56.864
-Play it safe, xiongdì.
-Xiongdì, xiongdì forever.

01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.189
-Okay, okay ready.
-God, let me see.

01:47:58.190 --> 01:48:00.531
Okay just wait, just hurry, just start there.

01:48:02.168 --> 01:48:04.354
It hurts, okay I can't do it.

01:48:04.468 --> 01:48:05.379
Take me to the hospital.

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:06.586
Shut up!

01:48:06.932 --> 01:48:11.826
Hey look, if I'm the mastermind of all this,
just let me have a second of silence.

01:48:11.827 --> 01:48:13.904
So I can figure this out, okay?

01:48:14.793 --> 01:48:19.282
Mere hours ago the Green Hornet
and a group of his criminal underlings,

01:48:19.283 --> 01:48:22.334
launched a horrendous attack on this building.

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:25.424
That claimed the life of District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

01:48:26.186 --> 01:48:29.652
It's unfortunate but,
you know, that's what happens.

01:48:30.608 --> 01:48:32.726
The Daily Sentinel will be rebuilt.

01:48:33.172 --> 01:48:38.619
And to start that off, I am naming
Mike Axford the new Editor in chief.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.490
Mike's a great guy he's comfortable telling me off.

01:48:42.495 --> 01:48:44.304
So, he's the perfect man for the job.

01:48:45.338 --> 01:48:50.891
Weeee, have to get this paper back
to the ideals that my father started it on.

01:48:52.847 --> 01:48:54.634
I want to make him proud.

01:48:55.286 --> 01:48:58.472
And I hope to make this city proud of the Daily Sentinel.

01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:00.168
Like never before.

01:49:04.839 --> 01:49:07.004
The Green Hornet sends his regards.

01:49:14.072 --> 01:49:15.826
Direct hit, he got my shoulder.

01:49:16.379 --> 01:49:17.692
Hey, The Green Hornet.

01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:23.599
-Get him to the hospital.
-He's shot in the shoulder. We have to
get him to the hospital right away.

01:49:26.244 --> 01:49:27.244
It worked.

01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:28.430
Ow.
