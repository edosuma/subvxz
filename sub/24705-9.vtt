34:32.585 --> 34:35.503
- Officer Licalsi.
LlCALSl: Good morning, inspector.

34:35.714 --> 34:40.293
- Security said you arrived at 6:30.
- I didn't know how to do this.

34:40.511 --> 34:43.262
No? You want some lemon cheese Danish?

34:43.472 --> 34:48.051
If you don't mind, I'd like to get
down to what I came here for.

34:49.270 --> 34:52.306
I'm glad he's dead,
Marino and his driver.

34:52.565 --> 34:56.730
They choose their work.
Whatever happens, I can live with.

34:56.987 --> 35:01.365
- Officer Licalsi.
- I knew Marino. Did you ever meet him?

35:01.575 --> 35:04.910
You communicated with Marino
before his death?

35:05.121 --> 35:07.577
Prior to his death, not since.

35:07.790 --> 35:11.919
- That's not the tone you use with me.
- Probably not.

35:14.714 --> 35:18.499
I gave this a lot of
thought before I came in here.

35:18.719 --> 35:22.502
I thought a lot about Marino too.
More than he deserves.

35:22.682 --> 35:27.889
Most courts would've given him what he
got and jailed him while he appealed.

35:28.062 --> 35:32.808
Licalsi, let's establish
some ground rules.

35:33.068 --> 35:37.814
The matter of the death of Marino
is closed. It's a cleared case.

35:38.032 --> 35:42.195
Alfonse Giardella did that murder.
He confessed to it.

35:42.495 --> 35:48.249
You may think you have some reason for
reopening those doors. You don't.

35:48.794 --> 35:52.292
Hear me on this,
because I'm not saying it again.

35:52.547 --> 35:56.212
I heard you.
I'm trying to understand you.

35:57.887 --> 36:01.884
I'm interested in looking forward,
not back.

36:02.141 --> 36:04.050
You're not a fool.

36:04.310 --> 36:08.059
You understand that just fine.
Don't you?

36:08.273 --> 36:09.684
Say I do.

36:11.025 --> 36:15.319
His death to one side, you say
Marino reached out to you?

36:15.530 --> 36:20.905
Before he was shot, he said in the
future, he'd ask me to do something.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.789
Why would he expect you to cooperate?

36:23.998 --> 36:28.993
My daddy was Dominic Gennaro.
One of the cops that got indicted.

36:29.212 --> 36:30.541
LASTARZA:
Who just died.

36:30.755 --> 36:36.509
Marino was blackmailing me. He'd rat
on my dad unless I did what he wanted.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.464
What'd he ask you to do?

36:38.722 --> 36:43.184
All I did for him was the thing
you told me we are not gonna discuss.

36:43.352 --> 36:44.383
Okay.

36:49.191 --> 36:51.599
- Why'd you come here?
- I was approached again.

36:51.861 --> 36:54.733
- By whom?
- I don't know who he works for.

36:54.906 --> 36:58.905
- Tommy Linardi.
- Probably. I don't know. Look.

37:01.288 --> 37:04.159
I want to get out from under.

37:04.584 --> 37:08.628
If that means losing my job,
if it means going to jail....

37:09.213 --> 37:10.921
Who else have you told?

37:11.758 --> 37:14.000
- No one yet.
- Keep it that way.

37:16.221 --> 37:22.259
In the meantime, I need some time
to digest all you've said today.

37:22.770 --> 37:25.605
I'll let you know
how I decide to proceed.

37:25.815 --> 37:28.733
They want me to run a license plate.

37:28.943 --> 37:31.516
I'll be in touch very soon.

37:48.589 --> 37:52.338
Yes, I remember you.
I'm glad you called back.

37:52.593 --> 37:57.589
My superiors authorized me to release
some classified information to you.

37:57.766 --> 38:01.217
This is on a top- secret basis.

38:02.521 --> 38:07.729
They want me to let you know, the
Gravity Shelf is in remission.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.106
The laser death team got recalled.

38:12.365 --> 38:18.451
Well, if the death team disobeys
orders from Shelf headquarters....

38:18.705 --> 38:20.081
Aluminum foil.

38:21.541 --> 38:27.248
In the small event that occurs, just
crumple two pieces of aluminum foil...

38:27.506 --> 38:30.176
...and stuff them in your undershorts.

38:31.010 --> 38:33.418
It defeats their sensor rays.

38:33.972 --> 38:38.931
Definitely, this could collapse the
empire of the Gravity Shelf.

38:39.186 --> 38:44.144
Yes, these are great days.
Okay, goodbye.

38:47.028 --> 38:49.399
You saved the galaxy.

38:54.870 --> 38:59.780
Roberts, you owe $ 14 for this month's
coffee supplies when you can.

39:00.042 --> 39:03.078
So how'd it go last night with Donna?

39:03.588 --> 39:07.585
Good. We had a good time skating.

39:07.884 --> 39:11.217
- Skating, huh?
- Yeah, over at the Skyline.

39:12.431 --> 39:14.755
Andy, $ 14 for coffee supplies.

39:15.016 --> 39:21.268
Detective, have you noted the absence
of the wedding ring on Medavoy's hand?

39:22.274 --> 39:25.061
Yeah, but it's not what it looks like.

39:25.277 --> 39:28.860
Plus note he seems to be showing
guilty confusion.

39:29.073 --> 39:33.321
It's not what it looks like.
I lost the ring down the sink.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.781
Sure, Medavoy.

39:34.996 --> 39:39.741
Roberts, being experienced,
when did you notice the ring missing?

39:39.959 --> 39:43.329
- It's missing now.
- Andy, it's not how it looks.

39:43.547 --> 39:48.339
It wasn't off yesterday when he
was trying to get Miss Abandando...

39:48.552 --> 39:53.892
...who you said was more likely to go
out with Martina Navratilova anyways?

39:55.352 --> 39:58.721
We wouldn't be talking
sour grapes, would we?

39:58.981 --> 40:04.224
Because Miss Abandando told you
to slap your hockey puck up your ass?

40:14.205 --> 40:18.619
I'm only putting in half for coffee.
I'll be gone two weeks.

40:18.877 --> 40:20.834
Screw you, Andy.

40:21.713 --> 40:24.584
- Thanks, Andy.
- No problem.

40:25.133 --> 40:26.961
We just went skating.

40:27.219 --> 40:32.130
Sounds like we're still in
misdemeanor territory, Medavoy.

40:32.849 --> 40:37.927
It was the craziest thing with the
wedding ring. I never take it off.

40:38.190 --> 40:43.944
This morning, I wanted to see if I
could, and off it flies down the sink.

40:44.195 --> 40:46.901
- Did you call the plumber?
- He's coming.

40:47.158 --> 40:49.447
- There's no problem, then?
- Yeah.

40:49.660 --> 40:51.071
Yeah.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:59.463 --> 41:02.914
I hope that wasn't what it
sounded like it was.

41:03.425 --> 41:04.706
What do you mean?

41:05.511 --> 41:09.010
I mean, it sounded like
it was about you and me.

41:09.223 --> 41:14.051
Donna. We went ice skating last night.
We had a lovely time.

41:14.396 --> 41:15.641
Yeah.

41:15.855 --> 41:20.019
And if some idiot wants to tease me,
that's his problem.

41:20.526 --> 41:25.652
I don't want to cause you any
problems at work or at home.

41:25.908 --> 41:28.743
You're not causing me any problems.

41:29.328 --> 41:33.991
And we didn't do anything wrong.
Just the opposite.

41:34.835 --> 41:38.084
- I had a really great time.
- Me too.

41:39.505 --> 41:41.545
You're one hell of a skater.

41:42.051 --> 41:44.506
Thanks. You too.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.135
KELLY: You seen Licalsi?
SERGEANT: In there.

41:51.602 --> 41:56.763
You disconnected your phone? I called
you all last night. What's going on?

41:57.024 --> 41:59.231
- I turned myself in.
- You what?

41:59.444 --> 42:01.105
I went to Lastarza.

42:01.362 --> 42:06.605
The asshole who gave Andy's shooter
the walk? You're going to trust him?

42:06.827 --> 42:08.452
I have to get straight.

42:08.663 --> 42:12.530
He'll eat you up,
spit you out and put you in jail.

42:12.959 --> 42:15.960
SERGEANT: They're looking for you.
- We're done here.

42:16.170 --> 42:20.667
LlCALSl: We should talk more about it.
- We're gonna talk about it.

42:28.601 --> 42:30.308
You looking for me?

42:30.519 --> 42:33.806
We know about Martinez
staking out Brick Top?

42:34.023 --> 42:35.815
- No.
- Sector car says he is.

42:36.568 --> 42:40.102
In case his father shows up.
Maybe he should leave.

42:40.321 --> 42:41.567
- Who?
- Brick Top.

42:41.782 --> 42:47.239
If Brick Top's holding, bust him. If the
father commits a crime, bring him in.

42:47.455 --> 42:50.242
Martinez is supposed to be on leave.

42:50.457 --> 42:53.293
He's trying to hold his
family together.

42:53.502 --> 42:55.211
You want me to get him?

42:55.422 --> 42:58.506
No. Tell the sector car
he's on assignment.

42:58.758 --> 43:00.087
Okay.

43:06.809 --> 43:10.012
BRICK TOP:
That's the way it goes down.

43:26.663 --> 43:29.369
- Hey, where you been?
- All over.

43:29.625 --> 43:33.872
All over? You're gone all yesterday.
You're gone all night.

She lost her son too.</i>

lnstead of being home with her,
I'm worried about you.

43:42.264 --> 43:44.553
- I know that.
- You know that.

43:44.767 --> 43:47.257
What am I supposed to do, huh?

43:47.477 --> 43:51.392
<i>Go home with Mami?
Pick up Roberto's body at Bellevue?</i>

43:51.607 --> 43:56.815
Should I wait till that guy comes
back and kill him? Am I a man then?

43:57.572 --> 44:03.824
When you were born, we had nothing.
No money, no good place to live.

44:05.748 --> 44:12.083
I was always afraid I couldn't protect
you. That's why I was so hard on you.

44:12.338 --> 44:15.956
I wanted you to be able to
stick up for yourself.

44:16.551 --> 44:21.759
Roberto was eight years later.
I had some money, a decent apartment.

44:23.225 --> 44:27.436
Maybe his life was too easy.
I mean, maybe I was too soft.

44:27.688 --> 44:29.229
You loved him.

44:30.065 --> 44:31.773
I love you.

44:32.318 --> 44:35.568
Look, I apologize for hitting on you.

44:37.073 --> 44:40.489
- I should have took care of things.
- No, no, no, no.

44:40.702 --> 44:44.237
- I messed up. You messed up nothing.
- I'm sorry.

James, I love you.

44:49.003 --> 44:51.292
I've always loved you.

44:56.469 --> 44:59.387
Come on, let's go home.

45:20.286 --> 45:21.697
You okay?

45:22.371 --> 45:26.950
I'm doing great. I don't understand
why you opened up to this guy.

45:27.168 --> 45:28.712
Hey, Johnny.

45:29.463 --> 45:33.128
Lastarza wouldn't let me
talk about killing Marino.

45:33.342 --> 45:35.715
You said you turned yourself in.

45:35.929 --> 45:40.590
He wouldn't let me tell about Marino
and his driver. It's a cleared case.

45:40.851 --> 45:43.388
He got Giardella to say he did it.

45:43.603 --> 45:47.388
A dozen of his cases crumble
if it comes out Giardella lied.

45:47.608 --> 45:51.475
But they have you.
Because you never reported Marino.

45:51.695 --> 45:54.862
This is a cancer.
It was spreading to you.

45:55.033 --> 45:59.659
- Lastarza will make you go undercover.
- You'd have killed that guy.

45:59.829 --> 46:03.577
- That's what he'll do.
- And I'm going to be okay.
