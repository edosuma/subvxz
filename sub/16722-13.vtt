(thunder rumbling)

00:21.170 --> 00:23.097
LINDA:
Happy Valentine's Day

00:23.098 --> 00:24.292
to all my loves.

00:24.293 --> 00:26.020
Smooches.
Everyone gets a smooch.

00:26.021 --> 00:27.315
(kissing sounds)

00:27.316 --> 00:28.446
Oh, give Gene mine.

00:28.447 --> 00:29.641
I'll take it.

00:29.642 --> 00:31.069
(kissing sounds)

00:31.070 --> 00:32.566
I hope a certain wife
is ready to be romanced.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.458
Huh?
Oh.

00:34.459 --> 00:35.554
Oh, Bobby.

00:35.555 --> 00:36.550
A pancake

00:36.551 --> 00:37.980
shaped like a heart.

00:37.981 --> 00:38.677
Wow.

00:38.678 --> 00:39.672
We got the rejects.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.134
Mine looks like a moustache.

00:41.135 --> 00:42.566
Pancake rides, five cents.

00:42.567 --> 00:45.256
I can't see what mine looks
like, but it feels

00:45.257 --> 00:46.353
ear-shaped maybe?

00:46.354 --> 00:48.379
What you doing under
the table, you silly?

00:48.380 --> 00:51.634
Hiding. I-I mean I'm not here
so I can't go to school.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.458
But it's Valentine's Day.
You love Valentine's Day.

00:54.459 --> 00:57.615
Until the St. Valentine's Day
disaster last year. What?

00:57.616 --> 01:00.172
I'm talking about
Jimmy Jr.'s Valentine card.

01:00.173 --> 01:02.565
Here, Tina.

01:06.884 --> 01:08.046
"From"?

01:08.047 --> 01:10.173
No...!

01:10.174 --> 01:12.631
My heart was murdered
by the word "from."

01:12.632 --> 01:14.061
No one says "I from you."

01:14.062 --> 01:15.554
I'm not going to school today.

01:15.555 --> 01:17.282
If Tina's not going, I'm not going.

01:17.283 --> 01:18.345
Scoot over.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.373
Yeah, we made a pact.

01:19.374 --> 01:20.836
Everybody out from under there.

01:20.837 --> 01:21.865
You're all going to school.

01:21.866 --> 01:23.030
GENE: No.
Yes.

01:23.031 --> 01:24.591
There's a lot of learning
to do down here.

01:24.592 --> 01:25.953
What's under there?

01:25.954 --> 01:27.249
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:27.250 --> 01:29.242

out of the park

01:35.955 --> 01:37.780
with your mother this year.

01:37.781 --> 01:39.972
Mm, more like a swing and a miss.

01:39.973 --> 01:41.967
Heart-shaped pancakes
is just as bad as a "from."

01:41.968 --> 01:43.063
No, it isn't.

01:43.064 --> 01:45.188
You do the same thing every year, Dad.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.883
You need to mix it up.
Yeah.

01:46.884 --> 01:48.078
What? I mix it up.

01:48.079 --> 01:49.771
I mean, I stick to a central theme,

01:49.772 --> 01:51.236
hearts, but your mom loves them.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.026
Yeah, she never gets tired of them.

01:54.027 --> 01:54.856
Huh?

01:54.857 --> 01:57.216
Mmm...

01:58.911 --> 02:01.303
Huh?
Oh...

02:02.431 --> 02:03.792
Well?

02:03.793 --> 02:05.886
Mm... (groans)

02:05.887 --> 02:07.247
Hmm.
Grow up, Dad.

02:07.248 --> 02:09.208
Only kids get to make homemade gifts.

02:09.209 --> 02:10.869
She deserves something nice this year.

02:10.870 --> 02:11.900
Mom's a real keeper.

02:11.901 --> 02:13.162
She's okay.

02:13.163 --> 02:14.756
TEDDY:
So, Lin,

02:14.757 --> 02:16.084
did Bob make another

02:17.380 --> 02:18.346

02:18.347 --> 02:19.342
Oh.
Oh.

02:19.343 --> 02:20.902
Ah, it's all right.

02:20.903 --> 02:22.995
Valentine's Day isn't about valentines.

Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

02:41.302 --> 02:43.126
Going on about love
when you guys don't...

02:43.127 --> 02:44.989
Have any love...
in the slightest?

02:44.990 --> 02:46.583
I just got a great idea.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.843
I'm gonna find love
for both of you today.

02:48.844 --> 02:50.837
We are gonna do speed dating.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.795
All right. I could go for that. I'm in.

02:52.796 --> 02:54.125
I'll make a sign.

02:54.126 --> 02:55.786
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

02:57.546 --> 02:58.711
BOB:
Okay, so what do you think

02:58.712 --> 03:01.501
your mom wants--
chocolates? Perfume?

03:01.502 --> 03:02.896
We don't think what Mom wants.

03:02.897 --> 03:04.789
We know what Mom wants.

03:04.790 --> 03:05.953
Great, what does she want?

03:05.954 --> 03:07.646
A Grazielda figurine.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.638
Oh, yeah, those porcelain thingies.

03:09.639 --> 03:11.766
Okay, I'll-I'll get
one of those. Thanks.

03:11.767 --> 03:13.027
All right, have a good day, kids.

03:13.028 --> 03:14.789
Dad, there are hundreds of Grazieldas,

03:14.790 --> 03:16.649
thousands maybe.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.708
Taking our jobs, marrying our women.

03:18.709 --> 03:21.733
Only we know the exact one Mom wants.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.922
Yeah, if you pick the wrong one,
it's like you got her nothing!

03:24.923 --> 03:26.683
Okay, so tell me--
which one is it?

03:26.684 --> 03:28.543
We'll tell you...
at the mall.

03:28.544 --> 03:29.673
Yeah, we should go to the mall.

03:29.674 --> 03:31.664
My heart will be safe
from Jimmy Jr. there.

03:31.665 --> 03:33.991
Hey, I'm not taking you out
of school to go to the mall.

03:33.992 --> 03:35.385
Okay, well, you know,
it's your marriage.

03:35.386 --> 03:36.515
(knock on window)

03:36.516 --> 03:37.643
You're holding up the line.

03:37.644 --> 03:38.643
Hold on, one minute.

03:38.644 --> 03:40.870
Hmm, I could stand to wow her.

03:40.871 --> 03:43.393
(horns honking) Then wow the woman.

03:43.394 --> 03:44.822
Stop, I'm... wait!
Come on, move it!

03:44.823 --> 03:46.483
You move it!

03:46.484 --> 03:48.543
I'm saying good-bye to my kids! (groans)

03:48.544 --> 03:50.005
You're sure you know?
I know.

03:50.006 --> 03:52.496
All right, we're going
to the mall then!

03:52.497 --> 03:53.593
(whoops) To the mall!
Yeah!

03:53.594 --> 03:54.822

I get you back
to school by 10:00,

04:07.979 --> 04:11.001
and you can tell your teachers,
um, you had, uh...

04:11.002 --> 04:12.032
A dyslexic episode!

04:12.033 --> 04:13.394
Pregnancy.
BOB: Hmm.

04:13.395 --> 04:14.522
Shingles.

04:14.523 --> 04:15.853
Uh, yeah, that's good, fine.

04:15.854 --> 04:17.976
BOB:
Wow, these are all so corny.

04:17.978 --> 04:19.872
LOUISE: What's so corny about
a puppy under an umbrella?

04:19.873 --> 04:21.300
(Bob groans)

04:21.301 --> 04:22.927
All right, so which one
does your mom want?

04:22.928 --> 04:23.990
That one!
That one!

04:23.991 --> 04:25.254
That one?
That one.

04:25.255 --> 04:26.781
Wait a second, you have no clue

04:26.782 --> 04:28.442
which one your mom wants--
you just tricked me

04:28.443 --> 04:29.474
to get out of school.

04:29.475 --> 04:30.601
How dare you!

04:30.602 --> 04:31.731
I believed them, too, Dad.

04:31.732 --> 04:32.958
Egg on our face, huh?

04:32.959 --> 04:34.390
Let me guess-- looking
for a Grazielda

04:34.391 --> 04:35.818
for your lovely wife?

04:35.819 --> 04:38.277
Yeah, so which one
is the least expensive?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.731
Oh, this is kind of our starter
figurine-- La Princessa.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.525
She's $250.

04:43.526 --> 04:44.889
What? That's your cheapest?

04:44.890 --> 04:46.848
I don't like that word.

04:46.849 --> 04:50.202
Perhaps you nor your wife are
really serious about Grazieldas.

04:50.203 --> 04:51.233
No, we're not.

04:51.234 --> 04:52.728
Who would be serious

04:52.729 --> 04:53.858
about these things?

04:53.859 --> 04:55.852
Bill Belichick, Peter Frampton,

04:55.853 --> 04:57.844
Linda Lavin to name a few.

04:57.845 --> 05:00.237
Kids, we're leaving.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.795
LINDA:
Welcome, ladies,

05:02.796 --> 05:05.087
to Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.848
You'll have one minute
with these fine gentlemen,

05:06.849 --> 05:08.775
and when you hear this--

05:08.776 --> 05:10.569
Kank-kank-- switch partners.

05:10.570 --> 05:13.392
But if you hear this--
cra-cra-crank--

05:13.393 --> 05:15.153
change topics.

05:15.154 --> 05:17.179
And who's ready to fall in love?

05:17.180 --> 05:19.040
(watch beeps) Speed date.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.532
So, Teddy, this is Gina.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.160
You two are now
in pre-love.

05:23.161 --> 05:25.053
We are?
Well, you got 60 seconds

05:25.054 --> 05:26.048
to figure it out.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.147
So, ticktock, let's go.

05:27.148 --> 05:28.375
Uh, I'm Teddy,

05:28.376 --> 05:30.004
like Linda said earlier.

05:30.005 --> 05:32.129
Um, what do we talk about?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.759
Uh, I don't know.
What do we talk about?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.184
I want to lick this one
like an envelope, mmm.

05:36.185 --> 05:37.743
Great, mail jokes.

05:37.744 --> 05:40.634
(laughs) Oh, you're a mailman.

05:40.635 --> 05:42.627
Kids, how about this cell phone cover?

05:42.628 --> 05:44.488
It says, "Got Milf."

05:44.489 --> 05:46.648
That's perfect, right?
For your mom?

05:46.649 --> 05:49.072
I'll get this and then I'll
bring you kids back to school.

05:49.073 --> 05:50.966
School? Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.528
Dad, you need to wow her.

05:52.529 --> 05:54.422
This is not gonna wow her.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.018
I thought you were done
half-assing it, Dad.

05:56.019 --> 05:57.677
Why can't you be more romantic?

05:57.678 --> 05:59.008
What? I'm plenty romantic.

05:59.009 --> 06:00.633
Very funny.
Stop goofing.

06:00.634 --> 06:03.292
What was the most romantic
thing you ever did for Mom?

06:03.293 --> 06:04.920
I don't know, I planned stuff.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.212
I planned a whole romantic day
one time.

06:07.213 --> 06:08.540
It was her birthday...

06:08.541 --> 06:10.600
No, wait, it was my birthday...

06:10.601 --> 06:12.293
No, no, no, wait,
it was Valentine's Day.

06:12.294 --> 06:14.188
It was our first
Valentine's Day together.

06:14.189 --> 06:15.884
GENE:
You are the worst storyteller.

06:15.885 --> 06:18.608
Where's Maya Angelou when you need him?

06:18.609 --> 06:20.533
BOB: Yeah, I made a picnic
basket and I picked out a spot

06:20.534 --> 06:22.495
to watch the sunset,
and then my car died.

06:22.496 --> 06:25.484
So we had to get towed
to the mechanic's.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.840
Tell me exactly what was wrong
with the car-- was it a gasket?

06:28.841 --> 06:30.567
Was it the carburetor?

06:30.568 --> 06:32.459
TINA: Guys, he's telling
us a romantic story.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.889
BOB: While the car was getting fixed,

06:33.890 --> 06:35.551
we went to a bar across the street.

06:35.552 --> 06:37.278
It wasn't the beach at sunset,

06:37.279 --> 06:39.804
but we, uh, we had a great time.
TINA: Aw.

06:39.805 --> 06:42.992
And there was this old beat-up
machine, like a love tester

06:42.993 --> 06:45.151
or something, and we squeezed
the lever together,

06:45.152 --> 06:46.415
and it said we were "red hot."

06:46.416 --> 06:48.274
And she kissed me and

06:48.275 --> 06:51.432
that's, uh, that's when
I knew we were in love.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.389
That's it. Buy Mom
the love tester.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.921
What do you mean, the actual machine?

06:54.922 --> 06:57.742
Yeah, she'd totally marry
you if you did that.

06:57.743 --> 06:59.439
Dad, do you remember where that bar is?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.164
Will it take all day to find it?

07:01.165 --> 07:03.324
Hmm, I do think I remember where it is.

07:03.325 --> 07:05.849
Oh, really?
We've got a mission.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.310
The most noble
mission there is--

07:07.311 --> 07:08.373
a love mission.

07:08.374 --> 07:10.233
It's a missionary position mission.

07:10.234 --> 07:11.430
Yeah, she'd really like that.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.390
Probably get it for,
like, 50 bucks, tops.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.919
All right, I'll drop you off at school

07:14.920 --> 07:16.680
and then I'll go to the dive bar.

07:16.681 --> 07:17.743
That's crazy.

07:17.744 --> 07:19.669
School is way out of the way.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.232
They're doing construction
on that one street,

07:21.233 --> 07:22.760
it's raining--
what a clusterjam.

07:22.761 --> 07:24.288
We should go with you, Dad.

07:24.289 --> 07:26.879
All right, you can come,
but then right back to...

07:26.880 --> 07:29.039
Uh-uh-uh, not another
word about school.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.600
To the dive bar!

07:30.601 --> 07:31.929
Next dating game...

07:31.930 --> 07:33.755
speed hand holding.

07:33.756 --> 07:34.888
(watch beeps)
And... hold hands.

07:34.889 --> 07:35.883
Kank-kank!

07:35.884 --> 07:36.979
(grunting)

07:36.980 --> 07:38.274
Teddy, Teddy,

07:38.275 --> 07:39.338
you're gonna hurt her.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.297
You're not trying to crush her.

07:41.298 --> 07:42.859
What?
I don't mind it rough.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.819
Very good, Mort.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.313
You are as limp as can be.

07:46.314 --> 07:48.540
Limp and clammy, my signature hold.

07:48.541 --> 07:49.538
(door opens, bell jingles)

07:49.539 --> 07:51.032
Sergeant Bosco!

07:51.033 --> 07:52.527
What are you doing here?

07:52.528 --> 07:54.752
Someone just robbed a jewelry
store on Front Street.

07:54.753 --> 07:56.013
He fled on foot in this direction

07:56.014 --> 07:57.213
so we're going door-to-door.

07:57.214 --> 07:59.206
Oh.
All we know is he's

07:59.207 --> 08:02.127
five-ten to six-feet tall
with an athletic build.

08:02.128 --> 08:03.890
Eh, none of you guys
fit that description.

08:03.891 --> 08:06.147
Wow, that's harsh. Hey. A few years ago.

08:06.148 --> 08:08.109
Bosco, I couldn't help notice
you don't have a wedding ring.

08:08.110 --> 08:11.130
Did the guy steal that, too?
No, I chucked it into a ravine

08:11.131 --> 08:13.158
after my divorce went through.
Oh.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.519
OFFICER (over radio):
500 block is negative.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.517
Well, keep looking!

08:15.518 --> 08:16.846
Damn, we had him,

08:16.847 --> 08:17.909
and then we lost him.

08:17.910 --> 08:19.469
Talking to me, Bosco?
No!

08:19.470 --> 08:22.427
Maybe don't leave
your thumb on the button?

08:22.428 --> 08:24.886
Eh, what's going on in here?
Speed dating.

08:24.887 --> 08:27.077
Ladies, I think we've
got a new contestant.

08:27.078 --> 08:29.105
No, no, if I wanted to feel like

08:29.106 --> 08:30.898
a loser, I'd just call my kids.

08:30.899 --> 08:32.957
But this is
Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating.

08:32.957 --> 08:35.118
Ladies and cops eat free.

08:35.119 --> 08:36.745
All right, you got five minutes.

08:36.746 --> 08:38.573
Okay, couple up,
clank-clank!

08:40.034 --> 08:42.857
How can I help you?
Yeah, I was here

08:42.859 --> 08:45.018
about 15 years ago
and I-I played

08:45.019 --> 08:47.078
this old timey-looking
love tester thing.

08:47.079 --> 08:48.406
Do you still have it?

08:48.407 --> 08:50.566
You mean Dr. Love's
Love Testometer?

08:50.567 --> 08:52.725
Yeah, that's it.
He knows it. Hooray.

08:52.726 --> 08:54.654
Eh, the owner sold it a few years ago.

08:54.655 --> 08:55.948
Oh, man.

08:55.949 --> 08:57.974
Do you know who he sold it to?

08:57.975 --> 08:59.535
Nah, no clue, sorry.

08:59.536 --> 09:00.930
I know where it is.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.028
Hugo!
Bob.

09:02.029 --> 09:03.024
Bob.
Ron.

09:03.025 --> 09:04.651
Hugo.
Yes, what?

09:04.652 --> 09:06.712
Oh. You know where the love testometer

09:06.713 --> 09:08.040
that used to be here is?

09:08.041 --> 09:10.333
I do. In fact,
later today I'm inspecting

09:10.334 --> 09:12.724
the establishment where
it's currently testometering.

09:12.725 --> 09:15.018
That's great. I think you
should invest in new soap

09:15.019 --> 09:18.273
for your bathroom before you
purchase vintage amusements.

09:18.274 --> 09:20.665
You think soap's the
problem with our bathroom?

09:20.666 --> 09:22.260
But it's not for the restaurant.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.689
It's my Valentine's Day gift for Linda.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.947
Oops, I just forgot where it is.

09:25.948 --> 09:26.878
Oh, come on.

09:26.879 --> 09:28.471
I'm not helping you buy Linda

09:28.472 --> 09:29.869
a romantic Valentine's gift.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.795
Maybe you should tell him, Hugo.

09:31.796 --> 09:33.888
Maybe I don't want to hear it, Ron.
All right.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.583
You're such a jerk, Hugo,
you know that?

09:35.584 --> 09:38.239
There are 97 bars and restaurants

09:38.240 --> 09:40.366
in my expansive jurisdiction.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.895
Good luck finding it, Bob.

09:41.896 --> 09:44.586
(laughs)

09:44.587 --> 09:46.611
BOB (sighs):
Back to the mall, I guess.

09:46.612 --> 09:48.539
Don't take this lying down, Dad.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.831
But Hugo won't tell us
where the testometer is.

09:50.832 --> 09:53.255
He said he's inspecting
the place today.

09:53.256 --> 09:56.345
So, okay, so what day is it?

09:56.346 --> 09:57.476
It's today.
Right.

09:57.477 --> 09:59.136
So you have to follow him.

09:59.137 --> 10:01.296
Yes! It's Valentine's Day, damn it.

10:01.297 --> 10:03.357
You're right. He'll lead us
right to the love testometer.

10:03.358 --> 10:05.084
Let's ride.
Hyah!

10:05.085 --> 10:06.778
(whoops) But let's get a hot chocolate

10:06.779 --> 10:08.140
or something first.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.368
It's all rainy out.
Great idea, Eugene.

10:09.369 --> 10:10.632
Whoo-hoo.
Mm-hmm.

10:14.055 --> 10:15.812
TINA (groaning):
You're too close!

10:15.813 --> 10:17.675
He'll see us.
I know what I'm doing.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.269
I've got a buffer car.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.665
You're gonna lead us
right to the testometer.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.724
And... we lost him.

10:22.725 --> 10:24.550
We didn't lose him, we'll catch up.

10:24.551 --> 10:25.547
I can still see him.

10:25.548 --> 10:26.712
GENE:
Look, he's turning.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.305
No, no, no, don't turn.

10:28.306 --> 10:30.001
All right, uh...

10:30.002 --> 10:33.389
Let's see if I can safely go
through this red light.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.448
We're losing him. Drive!
It's safe! It's safe!

10:35.449 --> 10:37.276
(horn blaring)
BOB: Oh, sorry.

10:37.277 --> 10:38.506
Sorr... I'll go.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.162
(car horn beeps)
I'll go... Stop!

10:41.163 --> 10:42.194
(truck horn blares) Okay!

10:42.195 --> 10:44.486
(horns honking)
I'm... I'm in the FBI.

10:44.487 --> 10:46.976
It's, uh, uh...
it's official business!

10:46.977 --> 10:48.439
S-Sorry.
(horns honking)

10:48.440 --> 10:50.133
Kank-kank.
All right, new game.

10:50.134 --> 10:52.093
Everyone say your favorite food.

10:52.094 --> 10:53.090
(watch beeps) Go.

10:53.091 --> 10:54.483
Soy sauce.
Wax lips?

10:54.484 --> 10:56.312
Plain white rice.
Fried green tomatoes.

10:56.313 --> 10:58.471
Favorite love-making position.
Go!

10:58.472 --> 10:59.966
The Fried Green Tomato.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.327
The Pick n' Roll.
The Broken Sprinkler.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.022
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
The Sticky Wicket.

11:03.023 --> 11:04.918
No, no, no. Getting people
to say their favorite things

11:04.919 --> 11:06.245
isn't gonna work.

11:06.246 --> 11:08.338
Sure it is. If you
like the same food

11:08.339 --> 11:10.100
or sex angles, you're compatible.

11:10.101 --> 11:11.992
I'd do the exact opposite.

11:11.993 --> 11:14.452
I'd make everyone say the worst
thing about themselves,

11:14.453 --> 11:17.143
the most embarrassing, darkest secret.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.398
If the other person can
stomach you for another second,

11:20.399 --> 11:23.255
then maybe you have
a chance together, maybe.

11:23.256 --> 11:26.179
What? That is the
least romantic...

11:26.180 --> 11:27.874
I want to do it. Let's do it. I'm game.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.368
No.
I'll go first.

11:29.369 --> 11:30.930
Hi there.
I'm part of a secret society.

11:30.931 --> 11:32.325
We hunt men for sport.

11:32.326 --> 11:35.248
Hello. I've had
a yeast infection for ten years.

11:35.249 --> 11:37.342
Stop. Oh, Gina, no. (gags)

11:37.343 --> 11:39.833
Sometimes I just put the mail
down the storm drain.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.528
I knew it. I knew it.
Yeah, there you go.

11:41.529 --> 11:43.321
I called in a bomb threat once

11:43.322 --> 11:45.413
'cause I heard Mark Harmon
was staying at this hotel.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.805
I wanted to see him evacuate,
and then I stalked him

11:47.806 --> 11:49.401
for a year and hit
his wife with my car.

11:49.402 --> 11:50.830
No, stop it.

11:50.831 --> 11:52.157
Saying icky stuff about yourselves

11:52.158 --> 11:54.020
isn't what Valentine's Day is about.

11:54.021 --> 11:56.245
Now, stop it.
Well, it's what love's about.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.902
And if you women can handle my baggage,

11:58.903 --> 12:01.228
then you can fly with me,
but bring a sick bag,

12:01.229 --> 12:02.988
'cause it's gonna be a real bumpy ride.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.351
Clean-up, aisle
my panties.

12:04.352 --> 12:06.345
No.

12:12.225 --> 12:14.085
Psst, over here.
Huh?

12:14.086 --> 12:15.648
Hey, do you have
a coin-operated machine

12:15.649 --> 12:17.174
in there that predicts love?

12:17.175 --> 12:18.405
Can't I just take out the trash

12:18.406 --> 12:20.664
one time without getting
hit on by some perv?

12:20.665 --> 12:23.221
He may be a perv, but that's my dad.

12:23.222 --> 12:25.116
Hugo's gonna take forever.

12:25.117 --> 12:27.207
We wouldn't have to wait
for Hugo to lead us

12:27.208 --> 12:30.066
to the next place if we
found out where he's going.

12:34.085 --> 12:35.912
It's locked.

12:35.913 --> 12:37.042
But the window's open a crack.

12:37.043 --> 12:39.069
Maybe we can find a hanger or...

12:39.070 --> 12:40.332
Hangers are for Sunday school clothes.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.860
Bring me a rock.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.156
We're not smashing the window.

12:43.157 --> 12:44.815
It'll look like the rain did it.

12:44.816 --> 12:46.046
Do it.
Get that clipboard.

12:46.047 --> 12:48.039
Gene, stop. RON: Uh, thanks.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.665
Hugo would have blamed me for that.

12:49.666 --> 12:50.994
Oh, hey. Hi, Ron. This is...

12:50.995 --> 12:52.722
Ron, what are you doing here?
Hey!

12:52.723 --> 12:54.085
This not my van.
We were just gonna

12:54.086 --> 12:56.178
get some ice cream
from this truck here.

12:56.179 --> 12:57.839
We're just getting the clipboard.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.000
Listen, Hugo's wrong
not to help you out.

13:00.001 --> 13:02.024
I don't know which place
has the testometer,

13:02.025 --> 13:03.654
but, uh, this is
where we're going today.

13:03.655 --> 13:04.947
Hey, thanks, Ron.

13:04.948 --> 13:06.575
You know, we'll check those places out.

13:06.576 --> 13:07.971
You're a good guy to help us.

13:07.972 --> 13:09.035
You're a great guy.

13:09.036 --> 13:10.729
I look up to you, man.
Oh.

13:10.730 --> 13:12.157
I wouldn't mind having
a friend like you.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.019
Okay, let's go, kids.
Thanks again, Ron.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.017
See you.

Excuse me, sir, do you have

13:30.931 --> 13:32.920
something called the love testometer?

13:32.921 --> 13:34.749
I got your love testometer
right here, pal.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.941
That goes in the buttbank.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.399
GENE:
Yah!

13:39.400 --> 13:41.725
Yah! Hyah!

13:41.726 --> 13:43.684
Well, this is the last place
on the list.

13:43.685 --> 13:44.850
It better be here.

13:46.045 --> 13:47.539
I'll have a seven and seven.

13:47.540 --> 13:48.900
No! Make it an
eight and eight.

13:48.901 --> 13:50.065
Make mine a double, would you?

13:50.066 --> 13:51.891
A 16 and 16, thank you.

13:51.892 --> 13:52.956
I'm good with water.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.314
No, wait.
Um, yeah, just water.

13:55.315 --> 13:57.872
Kids, please. Look, I-I've
been driving all over,

13:57.873 --> 14:00.030
trying to find my wife
this Valentine's gift,

14:00.031 --> 14:01.526
and you're my last hope.

14:01.527 --> 14:02.823
Everybody loves these tiny umbrellas.

14:02.824 --> 14:04.383
How many does she want?

14:04.384 --> 14:05.746
No, no, no.
I'm actually looking

14:05.746 --> 14:07.505
for Dr. Love's Love Testometer.

14:07.506 --> 14:09.730
Please say you have it;
I want to buy it from you.

14:09.731 --> 14:11.425
You want to buy my love testometer?

14:11.426 --> 14:12.723
You-you actually have it?

14:12.724 --> 14:14.350
Yeah, it's right over there.

14:14.351 --> 14:15.347
It's exactly as I remembered.

14:15.348 --> 14:17.539
It's beautiful.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.232
I'd love to sell it to you.
Great!

14:19.233 --> 14:20.696
But I can't, I already sold it.

14:20.697 --> 14:21.858
Hello, Bob.

14:21.858 --> 14:24.483
Lookie what I just boughtie.

14:28.403 --> 14:30.197
Odd bumping into you here, Bob.

14:30.198 --> 14:31.360
Oh, wait. No, it's not.

14:31.361 --> 14:32.888
I knew you were coming, thanks to

14:32.889 --> 14:35.446
Mr. Opens-the-van-for-anyone
over here.

14:35.447 --> 14:37.539
Hugo noticed the missing
carbon copy from the clipboard.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.432
Nerd.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.692
Now Ron's not allowed to ride
up front with me in the van.

14:41.693 --> 14:43.220
Come on, Dad,

14:43.221 --> 14:44.581
you need to get that
testometer for Mom.

14:44.582 --> 14:45.746
I'm starting to disappear.

14:45.747 --> 14:47.305
How much did he pay for that?

14:47.306 --> 14:49.663
A hundred bucks for that junk.
(sighs) All right.

14:49.664 --> 14:51.593
Hugo, please sell me
the love testometer.

14:51.594 --> 14:54.648
Uh, no. Hugo, this isn't
about me and you.

14:54.649 --> 14:56.509
This is about giving a woman a gift

14:56.510 --> 14:59.232
to make up for years of-of...

14:59.233 --> 15:01.657
Crap?
Well, not quite crap, Tina.

15:01.658 --> 15:03.387
Last-minute nothings?
Crap.

15:03.388 --> 15:04.682
Listen, Hugo, please sell it to me.

15:04.683 --> 15:06.111
Linda deserves it.

15:08.670 --> 15:11.459
Okay, Bob, I will sell it to you.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.652
For $500.

15:13.653 --> 15:15.245
But you only paid $100.

15:15.246 --> 15:17.106
$500?
Is that thing magic?

15:17.107 --> 15:18.269
You want it or not, Bob?

15:18.270 --> 15:19.533
Of course he wants it.

15:19.534 --> 15:21.160
It's just his money's all tied up

15:21.161 --> 15:22.357
in real estate right now so...

15:22.358 --> 15:24.417
Do you take fake credit cards?

15:26.044 --> 15:27.705
All right, fine.

15:27.706 --> 15:29.763
Another thing about me,
I'm hooked on pills.

15:29.764 --> 15:32.055
The bad kind that make you feel good.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.279
I like to play with a yo-yo,
so something comes back to me.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.006
People, enough with the confessions.

15:37.007 --> 15:38.271
You should know that

15:38.272 --> 15:40.328
there's hardwood under this carpet.

15:40.329 --> 15:41.658
Yeah, there you go.

15:41.659 --> 15:44.182
Stop, Mort, keep that carpet on.

15:44.183 --> 15:45.710
Damn it, Sergeant Bosco.

15:45.711 --> 15:48.369
You're infecting everyone
with your poison.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.027
Don't you have a jewelry store
thief to catch or something?

15:51.028 --> 15:53.185
That's why I have one of these;
it's called a radio.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.114
And one of these;
it's called a gun.

15:55.115 --> 15:56.641
Yeah, well, what you don't have

15:56.642 --> 15:58.103
is one of these.

15:58.104 --> 16:00.196
(imitates heartbeat) A heart.

16:00.197 --> 16:02.057
Mmm.
Ugh.

16:03.221 --> 16:05.378
Pleasure doing business with you, Bob.

16:05.379 --> 16:08.036
Wow. Now you won't have to get
Mom another gift for 30 years.

16:08.037 --> 16:10.129
Yup. This is the best
present ever,

16:10.130 --> 16:11.857
a living memory.

16:11.858 --> 16:14.017
Your Mom and I even carved
our initials on the side. See?

16:14.018 --> 16:16.110
Who's "BB"?
Bob Belcher.

16:16.111 --> 16:18.335
No, who's the other "BB"?

16:18.336 --> 16:20.992
Uh, what other...

16:20.993 --> 16:22.055
Oh, God.

16:22.056 --> 16:25.212
(rock music playing)

16:25.213 --> 16:27.471
This is fun.
What?

16:27.472 --> 16:29.232
Barbara Bunkley!

16:29.233 --> 16:32.056
Oh, how could I have forgotten
that Valentine's Day was

16:32.057 --> 16:33.121
with Barbara Bunkley?

16:33.122 --> 16:35.079
Who is Barbara Bunkley?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.238
What was I thinking?
Barbara Bunkley!

16:37.239 --> 16:39.498
Will someone please tell me
who Barbara Bunkley is?!

16:39.499 --> 16:42.056
I'm guessing it's our real mom.

16:42.057 --> 16:44.049
And she's beautiful and sporty.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.477
She was my girlfriend

16:45.478 --> 16:47.040
the year before I met your mother.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.900
I can't believe that.

16:48.901 --> 16:52.055
The date I'm remembering
wasn't with your mom.

16:52.056 --> 16:53.152
(laughing) What a moron!

16:53.153 --> 16:55.144
So this love mission was a sham?

16:55.145 --> 16:56.971
Hugo, I don't want it anymore.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.103
Take this stupid thing back.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.727
Oh, no, Bob, no refunds.

17:03.784 --> 17:05.345
Okay, okay, there we go.

17:05.346 --> 17:07.770
I guess we're a little
short on women, huh?

17:07.771 --> 17:10.029
Yeah, yeah, work those nubs.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.723
Ooh, that's it, right there.

17:11.723 --> 17:12.819
Another hard truth about me...

17:12.820 --> 17:14.281
Oh, you stupid...

17:14.281 --> 17:15.809
I pepper-sprayed my barber,

17:15.810 --> 17:17.103
but I mean, look at this.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.101
(angry muttering)

17:18.102 --> 17:19.332
Here it goes.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.026
I dress up as Santa every night.

17:21.027 --> 17:22.853
It's the only way I can go to sleep.

17:22.854 --> 17:25.277
Uh... What, Miss ten-year
yeast infection.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.935
See a doctor, why don't you?

17:27.935 --> 17:28.967
(angry muttering)

17:28.968 --> 17:30.693
I have a prison pen pal.

17:30.694 --> 17:31.754
He thinks my name is Michelle.

17:31.755 --> 17:33.151
Technically he's my fiancé.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.609
I also ran over
Vinny Testaverde's wife.

17:35.610 --> 17:38.101
Oh, that's it!

17:38.102 --> 17:41.790
Everyone needs to stop listening
to this cruddy duddy right now!

17:41.791 --> 17:43.782
Kank-kank-kank.

17:43.783 --> 17:45.110
Too bad, Linda, you just

17:45.111 --> 17:46.905
don't know anything about dating.

17:46.906 --> 17:48.734
Yes, I do.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.692
Then why is everyone listening to me?
They're not.

17:50.693 --> 17:52.686
They are.
Oh, yeah, well, without this...

17:52.687 --> 17:54.779
(gasping) Whoa!

17:54.780 --> 17:56.772
...no one's gonna listen
to you anymore, tough guy.

17:56.773 --> 17:59.762
Yeppity-do, da-da-da.
Sha-ba-da-ba-bum.

17:59.763 --> 18:03.051
Uh, Lin, I don't think you can
take a police officer's gun.

18:03.052 --> 18:04.879
Sure I can. I
just did. Look.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.474
No, I mean, by law.

18:06.475 --> 18:09.629
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

18:09.630 --> 18:10.992
No. Kind of.

18:10.993 --> 18:12.454
Is it bad?

18:12.454 --> 18:13.717
You're under arrest.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.878
(groans)

18:14.879 --> 18:15.976
Oof, oof, tight.

18:15.977 --> 18:17.437
Too tight.

18:17.438 --> 18:19.133
Shush. One size
fits all. Shut up.

18:19.134 --> 18:21.656
What's going on?
Mommy's getting arrested.

18:21.657 --> 18:23.948
What? Whoa-ho-ho, I thought Dad blew it.

18:23.949 --> 18:26.772
Yeah, well, Mommy blew it
real bad here today.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.700
She blew it. Oh.
What's going on

18:28.701 --> 18:30.626
is taking an officer's
sidearm is a felony.

18:30.627 --> 18:32.453
Whoa, Mom, you took his gun?

18:32.454 --> 18:33.651
She sure did, Louise.

18:33.652 --> 18:35.975
I just wanted to get control
of speed dating.

18:35.976 --> 18:38.767
That does not seem like a thing
you would need a gun for.

18:38.768 --> 18:40.659
Where have you been, Bobby?

18:40.660 --> 18:41.887
We spent all day helping Dad

18:41.888 --> 18:43.516
get you the perfect Valentine's gift.

18:43.517 --> 18:45.510
All day? You kids
weren't at school?

18:45.511 --> 18:46.771
Dad sprung us.

18:46.772 --> 18:48.632
I wanted to do something
special for you today.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.924
We... we went all over
town trying to find this thing

18:50.925 --> 18:52.620
from our first
Valentine's Day together.

18:52.621 --> 18:54.614
Dad ran a red light.
We went to Chinatown.

18:54.615 --> 18:56.075
And Pickles.
Pickles?

18:56.076 --> 18:57.935
And I spent $500 on it,

18:57.936 --> 19:00.325
but it wasn't from our first
Valentine's Day together.

19:00.326 --> 19:02.719
It was from a Valentine's Day
I spent with Barbara Bunkley.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.414
I remembered it wrong.

19:04.415 --> 19:05.908
I'm so sorry,
I'm... I'm an idiot.

19:05.909 --> 19:07.470
So you're telling me

19:07.471 --> 19:10.493
you let the kids play hooky
to run all over town

19:10.494 --> 19:12.586
to hunt down some
expensive thing you remembered

19:12.587 --> 19:14.248
from a date we didn't even go on?

19:14.249 --> 19:15.244
Yes.

19:15.245 --> 19:16.838
That... is...

19:16.839 --> 19:19.431
so romantic!

19:19.432 --> 19:21.290
Aw.
Aw.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.217
What?
Oh, Bobby!

19:23.218 --> 19:24.678
You went through all
that trouble for me.

19:24.679 --> 19:26.673
This is the best Valentine's Day ever.

19:26.674 --> 19:27.867
Ever!

19:27.868 --> 19:29.529
(radio beeps) Give me that.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.489
So you came here for speed dating?

19:31.490 --> 19:32.949
No. A jewelry store
got robbed.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.478
The suspect was spotted in the area.

19:34.479 --> 19:35.875
But you stayed for speed dating? Yeah.

19:35.876 --> 19:39.197
You must be hard up for chicks. Yup.

19:39.198 --> 19:41.392
I'm sorry I'm getting
arrested on Valentine's Day.

19:41.393 --> 19:42.452
Come here.

19:42.453 --> 19:44.148
(kissing sounds)
Ow. Ow.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.476
So, uh... what,

19:45.477 --> 19:47.470
I'll-I'll follow you two
down to the station?

19:47.471 --> 19:49.428
Yep. This little lady
is going right to...

19:49.429 --> 19:50.593
(static crackles) Shh! Shh!
Wait! Shut up! Shut up!

19:50.594 --> 19:52.286
OFFICER (over radio):
Be advised.

19:52.287 --> 19:54.712
Jewelry store suspect spotted
at 15th and Grand.

19:54.713 --> 19:56.471
All right, I'm on my
way. You, follow me.

19:56.472 --> 19:58.135
Well, I guess it's your lucky day.

19:58.136 --> 20:00.258
You talking to me?
No, for God's sake.

20:00.259 --> 20:01.556
I'll show you how to use the radio

20:01.557 --> 20:03.083
when you get back to the station.

20:03.084 --> 20:04.379
Oh!

20:04.380 --> 20:06.271
It's so easy to call in a false tip.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.068
Those streets don't even intersect.

20:08.069 --> 20:09.396
Hi, Tina.

20:09.397 --> 20:11.355
Hi, Jimmy, Jr.
You weren't at school today,

20:11.356 --> 20:12.586
so I brought you your homework.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.542
Thanks.
And a Valentine's card.

20:15.543 --> 20:18.299
(groaning)

20:18.300 --> 20:20.227
Aren't you gonna open it?

20:21.557 --> 20:23.547
"Heart"

20:23.548 --> 20:25.275
not "from." Yes.

20:25.276 --> 20:27.435
So, see you at school tomorrow.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.297
I'd really "heart" that.

20:29.298 --> 20:30.358
Uh, what?

20:30.359 --> 20:31.588
I'd really "hea..."

20:31.589 --> 20:33.182
I got to get going.
Yeah, me, too.

20:33.183 --> 20:34.646
So, that, uh, stuff you said earlier,

20:34.647 --> 20:36.506
that's the worst about you?

20:36.507 --> 20:38.597
Yup. That's it.
Oh, except for one time...

20:38.598 --> 20:40.193
Oh, oh, oh!
Don't say it.

20:40.194 --> 20:41.953
Here's my number.
(shuttering moan)

20:41.954 --> 20:43.181
Hey, I made a match!

20:43.182 --> 20:44.314
I bet I screw this up.
