02:02.465 --> 02:07.104
We have reason to believe you are
not who you say you are, Mr. Parker.

02:11.675 --> 02:14.144
Your wife and son,

02:14.178 --> 02:18.149
Mr. Leonard Turner, CIA.

02:25.989 --> 02:30.594
I have men posted outside their
door, back in Virginia, United States.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.665
Come again?

02:35.699 --> 02:39.536
For you to get this close,
you must have friends,

02:39.570 --> 02:44.342
informants, collaborators,
inside my organization.

02:46.510 --> 02:48.479
I want their names.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.668
Everybody?

03:50.074 --> 03:53.511
You look so stupid with
that pen in your neck.

03:56.779 --> 03:59.516
Don't ever threaten my family again.

04:10.326 --> 04:11.628
Go for Robertson.

04:11.661 --> 04:13.431
- <i>Get over to the house now.</i>
- What?

04:13.463 --> 04:15.565
Get over to my house, see
if everybody's alright.

04:15.599 --> 04:18.369
Get the... Just get the fuck
over there. Stop talking!

04:18.402 --> 04:20.637
Absolutely. I'm on my way.

04:20.671 --> 04:22.239
<i>Harry, get your mother</i>

04:22.272 --> 04:24.507
<i>and get out of the house. Go. Now!</i>

04:24.541 --> 04:26.744
- Dad?
- Get out of the house!

04:31.214 --> 04:32.649
<i>Mom!</i>

04:32.683 --> 04:34.652
<i>Dad, Dad, they shot Mom...</i>

04:34.684 --> 04:39.189
Harry, focus. Go up to my bedroom, OK?

04:39.223 --> 04:43.093
In the top drawer of my
dresser, the left hand side...

04:44.227 --> 04:46.329
- I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
- Open that up.

04:46.362 --> 04:49.499
- OK.
- Just the way I showed you.

04:52.169 --> 04:53.471
- <i>Focus.</i>
- Red means dead.

04:53.504 --> 04:55.605
- <i>Red means dead.</i>
- He shot Mom!

04:55.638 --> 04:57.775
<i>Can you get to the bathroom? Go!</i>

04:59.175 --> 05:00.877
- I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
- The kid!

05:00.910 --> 05:02.579
I'll take him out.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.548
- Dad, I hear them.
<i>- I know. I know, Harry!</i>

05:05.581 --> 05:07.384
Harry!

05:07.417 --> 05:09.487
<i>Just aim along
the sights, Harry.</i>

05:09.520 --> 05:11.322
<i>Don't pull it. Just squeeze.</i>

05:11.355 --> 05:12.456
Take the shot!

05:12.489 --> 05:14.792
<i>Squeeze the trigger, Harry!</i>

05:14.824 --> 05:15.860
<i>Take the shot!</i>

05:20.263 --> 05:23.533
Harry. It's OK, kid.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.437
It's OK.

05:28.372 --> 05:31.109
<i>Leonard, I'm here. Harry's OK.</i>

09:04.154 --> 09:05.823
Dad.

09:08.091 --> 09:10.394
Not tonight, kid.

09:15.165 --> 09:17.535
I'm joining the agency.

09:18.868 --> 09:21.037
Got my letter today.

09:21.938 --> 09:24.008
They're sending me to Prague.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.053
Congratulations.

09:36.085 --> 09:39.155
Yeah. Uncle Ken thinks it's a good idea.

09:39.189 --> 09:43.493
Uncle Ken's full of ideas.

09:46.596 --> 09:49.433
You still don't think I
can pull the trigger, huh?

09:52.602 --> 09:56.374
- I was just a kid.
- Yeah.

10:10.753 --> 10:13.056
Thanks for coming out today.

11:01.103 --> 11:03.674
<i>Reset.
Resetting simulation.</i>

11:03.707 --> 11:07.445
You're killing friendlies!
Do it again! Get it right!

11:19.756 --> 11:20.991
Again.

11:24.928 --> 11:26.096
Come on.

11:41.578 --> 11:45.148
Eyes down range. Acquire and fire.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.583
Go!

11:57.260 --> 11:59.963
Too slow. Do it again.

13:21.077 --> 13:24.615
Even your old man never put shot
groups that tight down range.

13:24.647 --> 13:27.083
Yeah, well...

13:27.117 --> 13:29.151
...paper targets don't shoot back.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.821
Spoken like a true Turner.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.656
Come on, kid, you got a letter to open.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.092
Regardless of what it says,

13:35.125 --> 13:37.094
I hope you'll stick around
here until your work is done.

13:37.126 --> 13:40.296
- The CONDOR...
- ...is the future, the tip of the spear,

13:40.329 --> 13:43.633
the edge of the knife, the
cat's pajamas, whatever.

13:43.666 --> 13:46.869
It's the cat's ass, wise guy.
Let me know which way it falls.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.009
- Good morning, Harry.
- Good morning, Laura.

13:53.742 --> 13:55.078
What's up, Harry?

13:57.747 --> 14:00.383
- Is that what I think it is?
- You bet your ass it is, buddy.

14:00.416 --> 14:03.352
Why do you keep doing this to yourself,
man? Four rejections in two years.

14:03.386 --> 14:05.088
Three.

14:05.121 --> 14:07.991
I know you wanna be a field
agent like your dad. I get that.

14:08.024 --> 14:10.427
Now, I've only read your
dad's dossier and case file,

14:10.459 --> 14:12.061
I wanna be your dad.

14:12.094 --> 14:15.364
Hell, I wanna fuck your dad.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.401
- That's gross.
- I've thought about it.

14:39.923 --> 14:41.357
Four.

14:42.425 --> 14:43.760
Four?

14:43.793 --> 14:46.929
Four rejections in two years.

14:50.433 --> 14:52.336
Yeah.

15:04.514 --> 15:06.249
It's not enough, Harry.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.117
We have a working prototype of the CONDOR

15:08.150 --> 15:10.120
being shipped to the
United States as we speak.

15:10.152 --> 15:13.255
And proof of at least a dozen
encrypted messages from overseas

15:13.289 --> 15:17.461
to the United States discussing
the sale of a "rare precious bird."

15:17.493 --> 15:19.128
That's not enough?

15:19.161 --> 15:21.764
Look, I'm on plane to
Langley in a half an hour.

15:21.798 --> 15:24.801
In the meantime, find me
some mention of the CONDOR,

15:24.833 --> 15:27.871
or how they plan to
acquire this "rare bird".

15:27.904 --> 15:31.408
Hell, find me the origin and/or
destination of said transmissions,

15:31.440 --> 15:32.942
and I'll run it up the chain ASAP.

15:32.976 --> 15:35.412
In the meantime, we got nothing.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.915
What did your letter say?

15:43.819 --> 15:45.189
It's gonna happen, Harry.

15:46.189 --> 15:47.924
At this point, I'm not so sure.

15:47.957 --> 15:50.126
You tell the old man you didn't get in?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.828
Nah.

15:51.861 --> 15:54.398
I'm sure he's probably busy
doing something right now.

16:03.973 --> 16:05.909
- This it?
- Yep.

16:07.010 --> 16:09.045
I thought it'd look different.

16:09.078 --> 16:11.848
Welcome to the 21st Century.

16:13.049 --> 16:15.184
You telling me the truth?

16:15.218 --> 16:17.521
We weren't followed. Nobody.

16:39.242 --> 16:40.343
Harry!

16:40.376 --> 16:43.179
Harry! Harry!

16:43.213 --> 16:45.848
Harry. It's your dad.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.852
It's your dad, You just got a
call. Come on! It's your dad.

16:48.885 --> 16:50.220
Listen up, kids.

16:50.252 --> 16:53.522
I want a full stop on
every other goddamn op.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.958
This gets full priority.

16:54.991 --> 16:57.160
- Director Sitterson
- Oh, Jesus...

16:57.193 --> 16:59.396
We're gonna do everything we
can to get your father back, son.

16:59.429 --> 17:01.030
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to be in the room.

17:01.064 --> 17:03.098
Negative. You're too
close to the situation.

17:03.131 --> 17:05.035
Judgement gets all
cloudy when you're close.

17:05.068 --> 17:07.436
- Sir...
- Go home, son, alright?

17:07.469 --> 17:10.973
We'll contact you the minute we got
an update on your father's situation.

17:11.006 --> 17:13.544
- He doesn't come inside.
- Copy that, sir.

17:19.115 --> 17:22.419
I want this room shut down until
this situation is fully resolved.

17:22.452 --> 17:23.520
Already on it, sir.

17:23.553 --> 17:25.622
Alright. Where's Robertson?

17:25.655 --> 17:28.325
In Langley. We have him
covering our stateside drop.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.393
I don't give a hot wet shit about his drop.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.596
- Get him on screen one.
- Yes, sir.

17:33.996 --> 17:35.131
Now!

17:41.937 --> 17:43.205
At this point we don't know much,

17:43.239 --> 17:44.508
except that the drop was compromised

17:44.607 --> 17:45.942
and the bird went with him.

17:45.974 --> 17:47.510
My sources tell me Leonard Turner's still

17:47.542 --> 17:49.411
in and around the Jersey area...

17:49.444 --> 17:51.213
I'm sorry gentlemen. Mr.
Robertson, you're needed immediately.

17:51.246 --> 17:52.882
- Where?
- In the conference link.

17:52.915 --> 17:55.184
- Sitterson is waiting.
- OK, Purvis, keep digging.

17:55.217 --> 17:57.019
I'm on it, sir.

18:00.123 --> 18:02.893
Dude, this is crazy.

18:02.925 --> 18:04.261
You do it all the time, Darryl.

18:04.293 --> 18:05.661
Yeah, on like Czech porn stars' phones,

18:05.694 --> 18:07.463
not on high-ranking CIA officials.

18:07.496 --> 18:09.232
It's for my dad.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.636
I've got Robertson.

18:13.669 --> 18:16.473
- Oh. Hey, Ken.
- <i>Sitterson.</i>

18:16.505 --> 18:18.407
Higgins, from the top.

18:18.441 --> 18:21.244
Leonard Turner, former
clandestine service officer

18:21.277 --> 18:25.415
and field operative, went missing
this morning in Newark, New Jersey.

18:25.447 --> 18:26.615
You're in.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.484
<i>- You said "former."
- Yes, sir.</i>

18:28.518 --> 18:31.453
<i>They pulled him from the
field due to his antics,</i>

18:31.486 --> 18:32.655
he was three weeks before retirement.

18:32.688 --> 18:34.156
What the hell was he doing

18:34.190 --> 18:36.593
in Newark, New Jersey,
on a Level 1 assignment?

18:36.626 --> 18:38.662
<i>I can answer that.</i>

18:38.694 --> 18:40.996
Good. Please, Ken. Enlighten us.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.398
Leonard and I go way back.

18:42.432 --> 18:44.134
<i>I knew the Agency was
looking to railroad him.</i>

18:44.166 --> 18:45.568
<i>I also knew retirement
would kill him.</i>

18:45.600 --> 18:47.240
<i>So I gave him one last
shot at field work,</i>

18:47.270 --> 18:49.372
<i>and I requested his participation.</i>

18:49.405 --> 18:51.040
In order to...?

18:51.073 --> 18:53.142
<i>In order to secure
the CONDOR prototype,</i>

18:53.175 --> 18:55.544
<i>and escort it back to
DARPA HQ in Arlington.</i>

18:55.578 --> 18:59.115
<i>When he didn't report in, I initiated
the protocol for a missing agent.</i>

18:59.147 --> 19:01.216
So you...

19:01.250 --> 19:06.423
So, you sent a washed-up, skid mark
of an agent to secure the CONDOR?

19:06.455 --> 19:09.024
<i>That "skid mark", nice term
of endearment, by the way,</i>

19:09.058 --> 19:12.395
<i>is the best goddamn field operative
the agency's ever produced.</i>

19:12.427 --> 19:13.963
Oh, yeah, apparently not.

19:13.996 --> 19:16.365
<i>- OK. Continue Higgins.
- Approximately,</i>

19:16.398 --> 19:21.637
Sixty minutes after Agent Turner
went missing, the CONDOR went active.

19:21.671 --> 19:24.708
OK. So, for those of us who didn't grow up

19:24.741 --> 19:27.277
jerking off to some science magazine,

19:27.309 --> 19:28.477
can you please explain to me

19:28.511 --> 19:30.613
the significance of this latest revelation?

19:30.646 --> 19:33.082
<i>In layman's terms,
Director Sitterson,</i>

19:33.116 --> 19:36.086
<i>the CONDOR is the ultimate
hack, allowing whoever has it,</i>

19:36.118 --> 19:39.289
<i>complete control over any
government's major communications.</i>

19:39.321 --> 19:40.689
How long do we have?

19:40.723 --> 19:42.759
Twenty-four hours from the
moment CONDOR goes active.

19:42.791 --> 19:45.194
Why 24 hours?

19:45.228 --> 19:46.696
Hey, you can't be in here.

19:46.729 --> 19:48.631
Because it takes 24 hours
for the CONDOR to go active

19:48.664 --> 19:50.133
and hack all the programs.

19:50.165 --> 19:52.034
That's Internet, nuclear platforms, GPS...

19:52.068 --> 19:54.037
OK. He can stay.

19:56.772 --> 19:58.375
How did you do that?

20:02.145 --> 20:03.312
A smart boy.

20:04.347 --> 20:06.782
We'll talk about this later on.

20:06.816 --> 20:07.784
What's the fallout?

20:07.817 --> 20:09.519
<i>If the CONDOR comes online</i>

20:09.551 --> 20:10.719
<i>and the government's
affected trace it back to us,</i>

20:10.752 --> 20:12.521
<i>at best, we lose their trust.</i>

20:12.555 --> 20:16.726
- At worst?
- They see it as an act of war.

20:16.759 --> 20:20.663
Look, is there any way
to reverse the activation?

20:20.695 --> 20:22.799
<i>Yes. My team developed
a Patriarch Key.</i>

20:22.831 --> 20:25.334
<i>It'll decompile the entire system,</i>

20:25.367 --> 20:28.137
<i>but it has to be physically
uploaded onto the CONDOR.</i>

20:28.171 --> 20:29.472
<i>Cannot be done remotely.</i>

20:29.504 --> 20:32.175
Alright. Get me this Patriarch Key,

20:32.207 --> 20:36.078
and I'll ensure that it gets hand-delivered to
our lead agent who's already on the ground.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.747
Agent, sir? As in singular?

20:38.780 --> 20:42.418
This gets out it's a PR
nightmare for the agency.

20:42.452 --> 20:45.821
The way it is now, technically,
it's FBI jurisdiction,

20:45.855 --> 20:48.625
which we are not so
subtly pissing all over.

20:48.657 --> 20:52.127
It's just better that we keep
as low a profile as possible.

20:52.161 --> 20:55.799
Alright, this is a
need-to-know basis, alright,

20:55.831 --> 20:59.069
so none of this goes out
of this room. Understood?

20:59.101 --> 21:00.436
Yes, sir.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.838
- Understood? Thank you.
- Yes, sir!

21:02.871 --> 21:05.574
- Any leads at the moment?
- None.

21:05.607 --> 21:07.844
- One.
- What's this?

21:07.876 --> 21:11.780
It's a starting point. I brought some of this
stuff to Agent Robertson a few days ago.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.349
He said it wasn't enough to
make a case. So I dove back in.

21:14.383 --> 21:17.153
I did a comprehensive search
of any suspected terrorists,

21:17.185 --> 21:20.656
black market dealers entering the
United States in the past 72 hours,

21:20.690 --> 21:23.626
- and I came up with this.
- The Ciocan?

21:23.658 --> 21:27.229
Mm, remnants of the Bucharest's
dissolved Camataru Clan.

21:27.262 --> 21:29.331
Now, they've been on our radar since '07.

21:29.365 --> 21:34.104
They have a small faction operating
in the southeastern United States.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.206
We have a positive ID on Drake

21:37.240 --> 21:39.776
entering the US via Hartsfield
Jackson two days ago.

21:39.809 --> 21:42.578
There's also been a number of coded
messages originating in Bucharest,

21:42.611 --> 21:44.746
talking about the sale of a "rare bird",

21:44.780 --> 21:47.250
which I assume is code for the CONDOR.

21:47.282 --> 21:50.386
<i>As I told Agent Turner, sir,
this is largely circumstantial.</i>

21:50.418 --> 21:54.690
Yeah. Well, still, it's the
only lead we have at the moment.

21:54.723 --> 21:57.827
Alright. We'll take it
from here, Agent Turner.

21:57.859 --> 22:01.330
Agent Higgins, would you escort
Agent Turner to his apartment

22:01.364 --> 22:04.167
- and see that he stays there?
- Sir, I wanna be a part of this.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.169
You wanna be allowed to
go stateside immediately.

22:06.202 --> 22:08.805
- Yes, sir.
- Well, your request is denied.

22:08.838 --> 22:12.207
Look, your goal is to get your father back.

22:12.241 --> 22:14.644
My goal is to protect the free world.

22:14.676 --> 22:17.312
I can't have your personal
agenda jeopardizing the mission.

22:17.346 --> 22:20.282
Those goals, director, are one in the same.

22:20.316 --> 22:21.584
Time's up, kid. Let's go.

22:21.617 --> 22:23.153
All right, don't worry.

22:23.185 --> 22:24.386
Now, we're gonna call
you the minute we have

22:24.419 --> 22:26.856
any information about your father.

22:27.924 --> 22:29.626
<i>Who's the agent on ground?</i>

22:30.693 --> 22:33.730
Agent Victoria Phair.

22:56.519 --> 22:58.855
Welcome to Newark, New Jersey.

23:03.592 --> 23:06.261
You've been briefed?

23:06.294 --> 23:08.430
I know the what. I don't know the who.

23:25.414 --> 23:26.950
Is there a problem, Agent Phair?

23:28.884 --> 23:31.221
No, no problem.

23:31.253 --> 23:34.590
I just think you should know I
have history with Turner's son.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.960
I wouldn't exactly call

23:36.992 --> 23:37.993
"fucking while you were at the Academy"

23:38.027 --> 23:39.929
a relationship, Agent Phair.

23:39.962 --> 23:43.266
The Agency is fully aware
of your "relationship"

23:43.299 --> 23:45.234
with Leonard Turner's son.

23:45.268 --> 23:47.804
That plus the fact that
you've lived in Jersey,

23:47.837 --> 23:51.674
went to college here, and have an exemplary
track record in the field to date,

23:51.706 --> 23:56.311
you have the perfect alibi to be
operating in and around the area.

23:56.345 --> 23:58.615
Now I'm sure I don't need to
reiterate how important it is

23:58.647 --> 24:02.718
for a CIA operative to not get
caught operating on domestic soil.

24:02.751 --> 24:06.623
It would be a shitstorm of
epic proportions if the FBI,

24:06.655 --> 24:08.890
or any other three-letter acronym,

24:08.924 --> 24:14.631
were to discover your presence here as
anything other than a friendly familial visit.

24:16.464 --> 24:18.434
I'm guessing this is the Patriarch Key?

24:19.835 --> 24:22.672
Correct. Now, according to Sitterson,

24:22.704 --> 24:25.508
you install it directly into the CONDOR.

24:25.540 --> 24:29.346
It is the only way to stop the
program once it's been activated.

24:34.050 --> 24:35.918
Anything else?

25:15.691 --> 25:19.062
Harry, I'm sorry about
the way this is going down.

25:19.095 --> 25:21.498
Me too.

25:36.511 --> 25:39.014
Hold him down!

25:39.048 --> 25:41.751
You've got... to fucking... chill!

25:58.434 --> 26:01.070
Son of a...

26:30.698 --> 26:32.934
How the hell does a
pencil-pushing desk jockey

26:32.967 --> 26:35.437
take out four highly-trained agents?

26:35.471 --> 26:37.540
<i>Harry Turner's been
training to be an agent</i>

26:37.572 --> 26:39.508
<i>since the day his
mother was murdered.</i>

26:51.520 --> 26:53.155
<i>I'm looking
at this guy's file,</i>

26:53.188 --> 26:58.493
<i>and it says he was passed over for
clandestine service... four times.</i>

26:58.527 --> 27:01.764
But... I don't know how
"high-speed" he can be.

27:01.797 --> 27:03.699
<i>The only reason he's
not a field agent yet</i>

27:03.732 --> 27:06.536
<i>is because his father's been
calling in favors for years,</i>

27:06.569 --> 27:09.672
<i>getting senior leadership
to deny his applications.</i>

27:09.704 --> 27:10.874
<i>He's good.</i>

27:27.522 --> 27:29.992
- What you got?
<i>- First and foremost, watch your ass.</i>

27:30.024 --> 27:31.026
<i>Sitterson's gunning for you.</i>

27:31.059 --> 27:32.227
And Higgins is pissed.

27:32.261 --> 27:33.796
Hard to blame him.

27:33.828 --> 27:35.865
<i>I tapped into the
Police Department files,</i>

27:35.897 --> 27:38.767
<i>then called in a few favors
to a buddy of mine in the ATF.</i>

27:39.799 --> 27:42.704
And the Ciocan use a local
biker gang to run guns and meth

27:42.738 --> 27:44.140
<i>up and down the coast.</i>

27:44.173 --> 27:47.076
The Infidel Motorcycle Club.

27:47.108 --> 27:48.711
Guess they have a place
called the Garage Bar.

27:48.743 --> 27:51.246
<i>Wonder if they have ladies night?</i>

27:51.280 --> 27:53.683
- Thanks, Darryl.
- <i>Yeah. Anytime, buddy.</i>

28:57.680 --> 28:59.115
Whiskey.

29:07.790 --> 29:09.692
We don't know you, brother.

29:09.724 --> 29:12.896
We don't like people coming
in here that we don't know.

29:21.270 --> 29:23.873
Are you listening to me, dick-brain?

29:29.744 --> 29:30.946
That's way too much, babe.

29:30.980 --> 29:33.214
That's for the bottle and the jukebox.

29:33.248 --> 29:35.051
- Fuck this guy.
- Jukebox?

29:47.963 --> 29:50.332
I'm looking for Drake Chivu.

29:50.366 --> 29:54.136
You tell me where he is,
and I walk on out of here.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.572
Let's kill this mother fucker!

30:21.096 --> 30:24.166
And stay out!

30:52.828 --> 30:55.231
Put the gun down.

30:55.864 --> 30:57.733
Well, shit!

30:58.901 --> 31:00.970
I missed you, too.

31:02.236 --> 31:03.739
Let him up!

31:12.114 --> 31:14.983
Alright everyone. I'd like to
thank you for your cooperation.

31:15.017 --> 31:17.220
Harry, let's go.

31:18.721 --> 31:20.056
Not yet.

31:20.088 --> 31:22.759
I swear to god, Harry.

31:24.092 --> 31:27.029
- Harry.
- I said not yet!

31:28.896 --> 31:32.902
Now, we are gonna try
this a whole another way.

31:34.470 --> 31:36.172
Put down the grenade!

31:36.204 --> 31:37.740
Vic, you should wait outside.

31:37.772 --> 31:41.142
- I'm not waiting outside.
- Vic, wait outside!

31:41.175 --> 31:42.877
It's Victoria.

31:42.911 --> 31:46.215
- Vic, will you wait outside?
- Fuck off.

31:46.248 --> 31:47.316
Fuck off, huh?

31:47.348 --> 31:49.885
Wait!

31:49.917 --> 31:52.754
Drake's brother's got a
mechanic shop over at Patterson.

31:52.788 --> 31:55.491
His name's Vinn. We get
all our orders from him.

31:55.523 --> 31:57.760
We never talk to Drake directly.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.060
I swear.

31:59.094 --> 32:01.264
What's the name of the shop?

32:02.196 --> 32:04.300
A-1 Mechanic.

32:06.434 --> 32:09.705
Now was that so hard?

32:15.277 --> 32:17.713
Who owns the Fat Boy outside?

32:22.050 --> 32:23.886
Give 'em here.

32:27.856 --> 32:30.126
Alright. Let's do this.

32:47.975 --> 32:50.212
- Sir?
- Yeah?

32:50.244 --> 32:54.149
Harry Turner just trashed a
Newark, New Jersey biker bar.

32:54.582 --> 32:56.384
Oh, great!

32:56.417 --> 32:59.487
It seems Agent Harry
Turner has just trashed

32:59.521 --> 33:02.491
a Newark, New Jersey biker bar.

33:02.523 --> 33:06.060
OK. Check in with Agent Phair immediately,

33:06.094 --> 33:09.932
- and prep an asset.
<i>- An assassin?</i>

33:09.964 --> 33:11.966
Jesus Sitterson, don't walk the deep end!

33:12.000 --> 33:14.837
I didn't say activate. I said prep.

33:14.869 --> 33:17.205
Come on. Look, I need a safeguard in place,

33:17.239 --> 33:20.009
in case I can't rein in baby Turner.

33:26.214 --> 33:28.550
<i>I was instructed to put you
on the first flight back to Prague.</i>

33:28.584 --> 33:31.887
- Did they say when?
- Immediately.

33:31.919 --> 33:34.255
Immediately? That can mean
a lot of different things.

33:34.289 --> 33:39.895
Hm. I'm pretty sure "immediately"
means right fucking now.

33:39.927 --> 33:43.331
Well, you know, time's gonna be tight.

33:43.365 --> 33:46.234
I have to save my dad, save the world,

33:46.268 --> 33:49.939
and I just have a feeling we are
not gonna make that next flight.

33:55.042 --> 33:57.112
Well, shit, Vic.

33:58.579 --> 34:02.117
I'm not going just yet.

34:02.149 --> 34:05.286
Look, the CONDOR goes live in 16 hours.

34:05.319 --> 34:07.423
So give me 16 hours.

34:07.455 --> 34:09.491
Then you can take me
back to Prague, Langley,

34:09.523 --> 34:11.559
whatever the fuck you wanna take me.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.161
I give you my word.

34:14.996 --> 34:17.966
We find the CONDOR, shut it
down with the Patriarch Key,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.069
and if you find your dad, great.

34:20.101 --> 34:23.973
Then you're on the next flight back
with me to Prague. Do you understand?

34:24.005 --> 34:27.141
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

34:27.175 --> 34:28.376
Grab your helmet.

34:57.606 --> 35:03.212
Mr. Turner... we
need the Patriarch Key.

35:07.415 --> 35:09.318
Get him ready.

35:14.323 --> 35:16.125
Understood, sir.

35:16.158 --> 35:19.028
I'm still running down the Ciocan.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.265
Agent Harry Turner?

35:23.298 --> 35:25.633
I lost him at the bar, but, don't worry.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.136
I'm sure I'll be running into him shortly.

35:31.073 --> 35:34.243
Yes, sir. Immediately.

35:34.276 --> 35:36.511
I'll let him know when I see him.

35:40.348 --> 35:43.251
Do not make me regret this.

35:43.285 --> 35:45.687
Oh, my God, can you hurry
up? I don't have all night.

35:49.323 --> 35:50.693
Hey, what's going on? What you doing?

35:50.725 --> 35:52.560
- You should go.
- OK.

35:53.394 --> 35:54.729
We got business.

35:54.763 --> 35:57.165
I don't fucking know you. What business?

35:57.198 --> 35:59.300
- You know her?
- Really?

35:59.334 --> 36:02.305
What do you think I'm trying to
do? I'm trying to get to know her.

36:18.153 --> 36:20.256
Really?

36:25.526 --> 36:29.264
Vinn... Vinn... Vinn...

36:31.767 --> 36:34.035
Where is your brother?

36:34.568 --> 36:36.037
What brother?

36:36.071 --> 36:38.708
I have a lot of brothers.

36:39.673 --> 36:42.410
- Drake.
- Fuck you!

36:45.280 --> 36:48.484
Now, Vinn, we need to
help each other out here.

36:48.517 --> 36:51.185
You see, I need an answer to my question.

36:51.218 --> 36:55.356
And you need to not
get your face blown off.

36:55.390 --> 36:59.728
Now, where... is... your... brother?

37:04.698 --> 37:07.102
- God!
- Turner!

37:07.736 --> 37:09.471
Goddamn!

37:09.504 --> 37:10.739
Ah!

37:10.772 --> 37:11.772
Turner!

37:13.642 --> 37:15.544
- One left, Vinn.
- Turner, stop!

37:15.577 --> 37:19.180
I'm gonna see him... I'm gonna
see him tonight, goddammit!

37:19.214 --> 37:22.618
- Where?
- The Lodge. The fucking Lodge!

37:22.651 --> 37:24.219
The Lodge.

37:24.252 --> 37:25.521
I know it.

37:25.553 --> 37:28.691
It's a swanky nightclub
downtown. Now, let's go.

37:35.729 --> 37:38.132
<i>So how swanky is the Lodge?</i>

37:38.165 --> 37:41.602
<i>A VIP guest list. It's
almost impossible to pay to get in.</i>

37:41.635 --> 37:45.440
If you're gonna be a part of this,
this cowboy bullshit has got to stop.

37:45.473 --> 37:47.109
It worked, didn't it?

37:50.711 --> 37:53.548
Can you get us into the Lodge or not?

37:55.216 --> 37:59.354
I can't. But I know who can.

38:02.890 --> 38:06.628
You guys are gonna love it there.
It's the hottest club I know.

38:07.495 --> 38:10.264
Oh, there it is!

38:10.298 --> 38:12.501
Here. Put this on.

38:12.533 --> 38:16.204
- No.
- This is no time to be modest, V.

38:16.238 --> 38:19.607
- Don't you have a pants suit?
- Stop objecting,

38:19.640 --> 38:22.477
take it and put it on.
You're gonna thank me later.

38:27.481 --> 38:29.484
Thank you. And you.

38:29.517 --> 38:30.885
Actually, you look pretty good.

38:30.919 --> 38:35.124
Maybe just a little product in the hair.

38:35.156 --> 38:37.892
<i>Tres magnifique</i> and awesome, bro!

38:37.926 --> 38:42.298
Oh, and you gotta lose
the white boy hoodie. No.

38:44.165 --> 38:46.635
Sir, we just received this.

38:49.271 --> 38:51.640
<i>My name is Leonard Turner.</i>

38:51.673 --> 38:55.377
<i>I am an agent with the
Central Intelligence Agency,</i>

38:55.410 --> 38:59.481
<i>and I have been taken
hostage by Al-dawla Sayyaf.</i>

38:59.513 --> 39:01.617
<i>In approximately 14 hours,</i>

39:01.649 --> 39:04.886
<i>the CONDOR will go live
and Al-dawla Sayyaf</i>

39:04.919 --> 39:09.157
<i>will have control over the
world's telecommunications.</i>

39:09.191 --> 39:12.461
<i>This message will be
followed by their demands.</i>

39:12.493 --> 39:15.430
<i>If those demands
are not met in time,</i>

39:15.463 --> 39:18.232
<i>all missile silos will be activated</i>

39:18.265 --> 39:24.272
<i>with coordinates set in the
continental United States.</i>

39:27.309 --> 39:29.778
<i>The demands are as follows...</i>

39:29.810 --> 39:31.579
Pause it.

39:36.551 --> 39:39.221
Hey! You.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.823
No peek-sies.

39:41.856 --> 39:43.859
Nothing he hasn't seen before.

39:43.892 --> 39:48.363
- Really? You two?
- Ancient history, Kris.

39:48.396 --> 39:51.332
Well, don't stop there, slut.
Tell me more. Tell me more.

39:51.365 --> 39:55.637
- Well, I was assigned to the field.
- And I wasn't.

39:56.838 --> 40:00.676
Well, maybe this is your second chance.

40:12.787 --> 40:14.522
Wow!

40:14.555 --> 40:16.357
Damn, I'm good

40:16.390 --> 40:17.925
I'm about to go get myself ready.

40:17.959 --> 40:20.662
I can't have you stealing all
the attention from the boys.

40:20.694 --> 40:23.631
Hey, and that dress stays
on while I'm gone, hero.

40:23.664 --> 40:24.933
No handsies.

40:28.569 --> 40:29.705
Can you help?

40:43.385 --> 40:46.588
This totes reminds me of...

40:46.620 --> 40:49.524
- Williamsburg.
- Yeah.

40:55.863 --> 40:58.300
We were good together, weren't we?

40:58.332 --> 41:00.802
When we were together.

41:01.702 --> 41:04.239
When we weren't, we weren't.

41:05.874 --> 41:07.776
It got complicated.

41:09.810 --> 41:13.682
I like complicated. Easy's boring.

41:16.850 --> 41:19.754
- Do you ever think...
- Always.

41:30.631 --> 41:33.799
We should focus.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.757
- <i>Where are you, kid?</i>
- Standing outside some nightclub downtown.

41:55.789 --> 41:57.692
Probably not the best
time to go dancing, Harry.

41:57.725 --> 41:59.928
- I know where Drake is.
- <i>Listen to me, kid.</i>

41:59.961 --> 42:03.365
It's not Drake. It's not the
Ciocan. It's Al-dawla Sayyaf.

42:03.397 --> 42:06.867
- No, that...
- I just watched the tape with my own fucking eyes.

42:06.901 --> 42:09.838
Now, listen to me. For
your sake, for your dad's,

42:09.870 --> 42:13.441
for mine, for Pete's sake, stand down!

42:14.441 --> 42:17.345
- Ken...
- Stand down, Harry!

42:20.981 --> 42:22.617
So I just spoke with Higgins and he...

42:22.649 --> 42:25.119
- Al-dawla Sayyaf?
- Yeah.

42:25.153 --> 42:27.923
That's bullshit.

42:27.955 --> 42:30.358
Think it's a misdirect?

42:30.392 --> 42:32.594
Only one way to find out.

42:34.428 --> 42:36.898
OK, hey! You're both in! Come on!

42:40.667 --> 42:42.738
In case we get separated.

42:48.676 --> 42:49.878
So what's the plan?

42:50.979 --> 42:54.448
Get inside. Find Drake.

42:54.481 --> 42:55.684
Ask him where my dad is.

42:55.716 --> 42:57.752
So the plan is you have no plan.

42:58.553 --> 42:59.821
Works in the movies.

43:00.722 --> 43:02.091
You're ridiculous.

43:03.691 --> 43:07.730
Stick with me, kid. You
might learn something'.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.636
<i>Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to head up to Jersey.</i>

43:14.669 --> 43:16.972
<i>Something about this
whole Al-dawla Sayyaf</i>

43:17.004 --> 43:19.039
<i>just doesn't sit right with me.</i>

43:19.073 --> 43:22.711
Alright, fine. I'm
sending Higgins with you.

43:22.743 --> 43:25.847
- <i>But, sir...</i>
- He's already in the air.

43:25.879 --> 43:27.448
<i>Alright party
people, let's turn it up!</i>

43:36.691 --> 43:40.828
No, no, no...

43:40.861 --> 43:42.798
It's that he does not know when to quit.

43:47.001 --> 43:49.071
Yeah. Let her through, goddammit.

43:58.111 --> 44:01.816
My father sent me to let you know, he's
really pleased doing business with you.

44:01.850 --> 44:03.618
That's awesome.

44:03.651 --> 44:05.854
How is your father? I
fucking love that guy.

44:05.886 --> 44:09.124
Too many women, too much vodka.

44:10.792 --> 44:13.694
So, seeing anyone these
last couple of years?

44:13.727 --> 44:16.497
It's none of your business.

44:16.531 --> 44:20.135
Hey, handsome, can I interest
you in a specialty cocktail?

44:20.167 --> 44:21.236
You want a shot?

44:21.269 --> 44:23.205
- Uh, no.
- No?

44:26.106 --> 44:29.076
- Let me know if you need anything else.
- Thank you.

44:29.109 --> 44:31.979
- Anything else.
- I just might do that.

44:42.089 --> 44:43.591
Make some room, please.

44:45.993 --> 44:48.696
Tell your father our
relationship is in good standing.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.565
I'll let him know.

44:58.705 --> 45:00.209
There he is.

45:22.964 --> 45:24.900
Stop smiling.

45:27.267 --> 45:29.670
Kris. Remember New Orleans?

45:29.703 --> 45:31.772
Oh! Who are we seducing?

45:34.943 --> 45:36.578
Him? Really?

45:36.611 --> 45:39.114
You always did have a weird taste.

45:55.028 --> 45:58.198
Uncool, Ms. Phair. Uncool.

45:58.231 --> 46:00.568
Don't be jelly, Turner.

46:20.754 --> 46:24.224
- What's your name, beautiful?
- What?

46:24.258 --> 46:27.062
Jesus, fucking crazy wasted.

46:27.095 --> 46:29.631
What's your name?

46:29.664 --> 46:31.031
Whatever you want it to be, babe.

46:31.064 --> 46:33.767
Heather. I like Heather.

46:33.801 --> 46:37.305
That's my mom's name.

46:37.338 --> 46:40.207
- Mm.
- Can I have... some more?

46:40.240 --> 46:42.710
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

46:49.082 --> 46:51.118
So, Heather?

46:51.151 --> 46:53.955
You like to kiss both men and women?

46:55.089 --> 46:57.192
I can't hear you.

46:57.225 --> 47:00.295
Can we go somewhere private possibly?

47:01.194 --> 47:03.131
Absolutely.

47:05.767 --> 47:08.169
Please show this lovely
lady to the private room.

47:08.202 --> 47:10.305
Private room...

47:13.040 --> 47:14.676
Thank you, sir.

47:25.952 --> 47:27.955
Get the fuck out.

47:28.990 --> 47:31.059
You too, princess.

47:38.165 --> 47:41.102
I've always wanted to try this.

47:42.135 --> 47:43.871
Yeah? Well, don't break it.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.777
I'm in this asshole's pussy palace.

47:51.178 --> 47:54.281
Jesus. You just call
me if you're in trouble.

48:05.926 --> 48:09.164
Uh-huh. I'm glad you
came back here with me.

48:09.196 --> 48:10.964
People say I'm dangerous,
I don't know what it is.

48:10.997 --> 48:12.766
I think it's the fucking hair.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.171
I like your hair. I like
a little danger, too.

48:20.908 --> 48:23.045
Oh, shit!

48:24.111 --> 48:27.281
Yeah.

48:27.314 --> 48:29.751
<i>Harry, there's a
wet work order out on you.</i>

48:29.783 --> 48:33.454
<i>Did you hear me? You've been
targeted for assassination.</i>

48:34.856 --> 48:38.026
- How long?
- <i>The asset's en route.</i>

48:40.093 --> 48:41.896
Thanks, Darryl.

48:55.943 --> 48:58.178
I really have to go to the ladies room.

48:58.211 --> 49:00.948
You're not going anywhere.

49:21.169 --> 49:23.338
I have it within my power to level nations.

49:23.370 --> 49:26.106
Think one little bitch from the
CIA will pose much of a threat, huh?

49:26.140 --> 49:28.042
Agent Victoria Phair.

49:42.423 --> 49:43.925
Fuck!

49:45.526 --> 49:48.897
- <i>Harry. Harry, help!</i>
- On my way!

49:50.363 --> 49:53.834
- You fucked up, bitch.
- Fuck you!

49:53.868 --> 49:57.338
Get the fuck up! Get up!
Pick up your legs! Move!

49:57.370 --> 50:00.441
Move! Come on! Come on!

50:35.977 --> 50:38.847
It's a shame really. We're out of time.

50:38.879 --> 50:41.415
I was looking forward to seeing
how far you were willing to go.

50:43.283 --> 50:44.952
Don't think so.

50:50.925 --> 50:52.327
I got it.

51:15.649 --> 51:18.653
- I had him.
- Oh, you are so male right now.

51:18.685 --> 51:20.222
Come on.

51:22.522 --> 51:24.291
Stay down!

51:30.497 --> 51:33.200
That's enough! That's enough!

51:33.234 --> 51:35.536
I don't know who this
kung fu cock sucker is,

51:35.568 --> 51:37.571
but get him the fuck out of here!

51:38.638 --> 51:40.474
And none of you, dumb fucks talk shit!

51:40.508 --> 51:44.611
Walk bitch. Walk! Faster!

52:07.600 --> 52:10.037
Where's your car? Where's your car?!

52:13.073 --> 52:17.044
Let's go. Hit it.

52:26.354 --> 52:29.290
- How well do you know Jersey?
- Huh?

52:31.158 --> 52:34.296
Forget it. Can you go any faster?

52:50.111 --> 52:51.646
Pick-up, you dumb motherfucker.

52:51.678 --> 52:53.548
Have you talked to my brother?

52:53.580 --> 52:56.751
<i>What the fuck are you laughing at?</i>

52:56.783 --> 52:58.086
Motherfucker!

52:58.118 --> 52:59.687
Abraham Lincoln Elementary.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.990
Abraham Lincoln Elementary!

53:02.022 --> 53:05.727
Oh, I went there for a
year. It was kind of cool.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.330
- Oh, go there! I got you!
- Go!

53:17.638 --> 53:20.375
<i>I love this
drive-thru. Anyone up for a taco?</i>

53:20.408 --> 53:23.310
- Drive-thru. Tacos?
- Which one?

53:23.343 --> 53:25.312
- How many are there?
- There's like four or five!

53:25.345 --> 53:29.117
- Fuck!
- But the only one with a drive-thru is on Tennessee.

53:29.149 --> 53:31.352
Go! Go! Tennessee.

53:34.522 --> 53:36.157
Kris, this is a one-way!

53:36.189 --> 53:38.559
Kris!

53:39.693 --> 53:41.562
Shit!

53:41.595 --> 53:43.196
Whoa, that was close.

53:43.229 --> 53:46.066
Kris, you're crazy.

53:48.102 --> 53:49.470
Where are we going?

53:49.502 --> 53:52.339
Well, if I told you, I'd
have to kill you, which,

53:52.372 --> 53:56.377
full disclosure, I would
love nothing more. But, ah...

53:57.611 --> 54:00.147
Sorry about your face.

54:14.327 --> 54:16.764
There they are. There they are!

54:47.627 --> 54:51.298
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

55:50.658 --> 55:53.493
OK. So, what do you want me to do?

55:53.526 --> 55:55.195
Alright, look.

55:55.229 --> 55:56.931
If you don't hear from me in an hour

55:56.964 --> 55:59.367
call Robertson at this number.

56:00.301 --> 56:02.770
- You got it?
- Got it.

56:02.803 --> 56:05.306
So, what do I do if he doesn't answer?

56:05.339 --> 56:09.644
- Just stay in the car.
- OK.

56:09.676 --> 56:12.613
- Are you sure you don't want me to come in?
- Stay in the car!

56:12.646 --> 56:13.814
OK.

57:01.028 --> 57:02.564
Hey.

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:55.128
Dad... Dad.

01:00:55.162 --> 01:00:57.765
- Harry.
- Dad.

01:00:57.798 --> 01:00:59.200
Are you alright?

01:00:59.232 --> 01:01:02.669
Yeah. Are you OK?

01:01:05.071 --> 01:01:07.607
Does anyone know you're here?

01:01:08.242 --> 01:01:10.176
Did you follow protocol?

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:14.514
Dad... are you OK?

01:01:15.115 --> 01:01:17.651
Harry... focus.

01:01:19.019 --> 01:01:21.455
Does anyone know you're here?

01:01:24.591 --> 01:01:26.027
No.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.630
No one knows you're here?

01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:35.635
No. The last person I
spoke to was Uncle Ken.

01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:42.043
Look, I'm sorry, Dad. I fucked up.

01:01:43.776 --> 01:01:48.148
No, son. You did everything you could.

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:51.051
We're fine.

01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:54.555
No one knows we're here.

01:02:05.899 --> 01:02:07.568
Dad?

01:02:09.736 --> 01:02:11.038
Give us a minute.

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:19.813
I'm sorry about all this, Harry.

01:02:19.845 --> 01:02:21.881
What's going on, Dad?

01:02:21.914 --> 01:02:26.185
- Retaliation.
- I don't understand.

01:02:26.218 --> 01:02:29.022
Retaliation for your mother.

01:02:29.055 --> 01:02:31.626
What's this got to do with Mom?

01:02:37.798 --> 01:02:40.834
The CIA leaked my cover.

01:02:45.705 --> 01:02:46.941
Correction...

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:51.678
The CIA gave up my cover.

01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:57.150
Cost me your mother.

01:02:58.852 --> 01:03:00.855
Almost cost me you.

01:03:04.957 --> 01:03:07.093
You stole the CONDOR.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.130
As payback.

01:03:12.231 --> 01:03:15.602
So you're just gonna turn your
back on everything you stood for?

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:20.107
They turned their back on me first, Harry.

01:03:21.707 --> 01:03:23.910
- Where's Victoria?
- She's here.

01:03:23.943 --> 01:03:25.679
I want to see her.

01:03:26.647 --> 01:03:29.750
She is no longer your concern.

01:03:51.437 --> 01:03:53.374
Give me the Patriarch Key.

01:03:55.075 --> 01:03:57.044
You're killing him.

01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:02.984
The only thing Harry's
ever wanted in life...

01:04:03.783 --> 01:04:05.653
...was to be like you.

01:04:09.455 --> 01:04:12.292
Give me the key.

01:04:26.138 --> 01:04:27.240
Bye.

01:04:42.856 --> 01:04:45.059
Well, the buyers are here.

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:47.694
Send them in.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.263
And bring my son up.

01:04:51.997 --> 01:04:53.967
He'll wanna see this.

01:04:54.968 --> 01:04:56.803
Goddammit.

01:05:06.479 --> 01:05:08.214
Fucking little bitch.

01:05:08.247 --> 01:05:09.983
Fuck off.

01:05:11.852 --> 01:05:14.754
Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up!

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:16.122
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:16.156 --> 01:05:18.092
This is a nice fucking jacket, brother.

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:20.059
Where'd you get this jacket?

01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:22.396
Oh, you don't feel like talking much?

01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:29.870
Ivan!

01:05:34.006 --> 01:05:37.910
This place like Russia, cold and wet.

01:05:37.943 --> 01:05:40.513
Very good for the skin,
that's what they say.

01:05:40.546 --> 01:05:44.251
Good skin is for hookers and potatoes.

01:05:46.352 --> 01:05:48.488
I hadn't thought of it that way.

01:05:50.524 --> 01:05:54.095
As promised... the CONDOR.

01:05:55.961 --> 01:06:00.400
- This is it?
- Yeah. This is it.

01:06:01.267 --> 01:06:03.436
Demonstration, please.

01:06:28.894 --> 01:06:30.764
Goddamn, we're online!

01:06:34.133 --> 01:06:37.003
And it's done.

01:06:37.037 --> 01:06:39.874
Half of China just lost cell reception.

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.983
Sir, the CONDOR just activated.

01:06:51.017 --> 01:06:54.254
- What's its target?
- A Chinese telecommunications network.

01:06:54.287 --> 01:06:57.057
Son of a bitch!

01:06:59.392 --> 01:07:01.194
Guard!

01:07:01.894 --> 01:07:03.296
Guard!

01:07:06.098 --> 01:07:07.466
I have to go to the little girls' room.

01:07:07.499 --> 01:07:09.068
So go in your fucking pants.

01:07:09.102 --> 01:07:11.806
You're not gonna really
let me hang here, are you?

01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:14.140
Come here.

01:07:39.999 --> 01:07:43.002
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.245
Don't do this.

01:07:57.216 --> 01:07:59.519
We've met before, you and I.

01:08:00.519 --> 01:08:02.021
Excuse me?

01:08:02.055 --> 01:08:05.024
Not face-to-face. But
our paths have crossed.

01:08:05.057 --> 01:08:08.594
You sure? 'Cause I would remember.

01:08:08.627 --> 01:08:12.131
December 21st, 2004.

01:08:12.164 --> 01:08:16.969
- Ring a bell?
- December...?

01:08:17.002 --> 01:08:19.874
No. I'm sorry, it doesn't.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.910
It means everything to me.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.879
To my son.

01:08:26.513 --> 01:08:27.981
Cause that is the day

01:08:28.013 --> 01:08:30.249
that you purchased my cover from CIA

01:08:30.283 --> 01:08:33.153
and sold it to Dmitri Kovrov.

01:08:33.185 --> 01:08:35.689
The day you signed my
wife's death sentence.

01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:40.627
- I did no such thing.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:44.899
Drake.

01:08:57.109 --> 01:08:58.444
Say her name.

01:09:00.712 --> 01:09:02.716
Say her name!

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:04.251
I don't know!

01:09:04.283 --> 01:09:08.122
I'll help you. Kate Turner!

01:09:09.154 --> 01:09:12.457
Kate... Kate... Turner!

01:09:12.492 --> 01:09:15.261
Harry. Harry.

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:22.670
For your mother.

01:09:23.736 --> 01:09:25.638
Finish it off.

01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:27.408
Fuck you.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:36.082
Fuck you, and your dead mother!

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:46.492
Alright...

01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:59.272
Hands up!

01:10:00.806 --> 01:10:03.242
Higgins, put away your weapon.

01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:05.578
- Sir?
- Holster your weapon.

01:10:05.611 --> 01:10:08.080
Looks like you had a busy day.

01:10:08.114 --> 01:10:11.418
Higgins, put the CONDOR in the
car. Take it back to Prague.

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:13.419
Ken. Shut the fuck up.

01:10:13.453 --> 01:10:14.620
What the fuck are you doing, Leonard?

01:10:14.654 --> 01:10:16.522
Fuck if I know.

01:10:16.556 --> 01:10:19.560
Take a step back. Back the fuck up.

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:22.461
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:25.464
You back away from the CONDOR,

01:10:25.498 --> 01:10:28.602
or I will blow a fucking round right
through your dumb fucking skull.

01:10:28.635 --> 01:10:30.137
Do you understand?

01:10:34.641 --> 01:10:36.810
It didn't have to be like this, friend.

01:10:36.842 --> 01:10:38.544
No. It was Sitterson.

01:10:38.578 --> 01:10:41.248
I tried to keep you out of
this, Harry. Lord knows I tried.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.551
But you're a Turner thru
and thru. Stubborn as hell.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:45.818
Who put the hit on my kid?

01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:47.753
I didn't want to, but I had no choice.

01:10:47.787 --> 01:10:49.556
I couldn't have him sabotaging

01:10:49.588 --> 01:10:51.757
everything I worked so
hard to put into motion.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.360
But we could still save this.

01:10:53.392 --> 01:10:55.796
There's 150 million bucks in an account.

01:10:55.829 --> 01:10:59.800
I take the CONDOR, we're
talking billions. Billions!

01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.235
Step back.

01:11:02.267 --> 01:11:04.171
Step... back.

01:11:04.204 --> 01:11:05.672
Ken, you're a smart guy.

01:11:05.704 --> 01:11:08.475
You think anybody's walking
out of here with the CONDOR.

01:11:09.309 --> 01:11:11.711
What are you waiting for?

01:11:11.744 --> 01:11:13.647
You broke the deal, Leonard.

01:11:15.515 --> 01:11:16.749
Dad?

01:11:22.588 --> 01:11:24.624
- Dad!
- Harry, get the CONDOR.

01:11:27.827 --> 01:11:29.730
Put the gun down.

01:11:30.762 --> 01:11:32.665
Fucking dead, bitch!

01:11:37.604 --> 01:11:39.705
Stop him, Harry!

01:11:39.739 --> 01:11:41.208
Ken!

01:11:46.846 --> 01:11:48.248
You like diamonds, bitch?

01:12:06.266 --> 01:12:09.536
Ken!

01:12:09.569 --> 01:12:12.172
You're tenacious, kid. I'll give you that!

01:14:41.654 --> 01:14:44.258
Sorry...

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:59.705
Dad! Dad! I got it!

01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:08.614
Let me lean you up.

01:15:14.954 --> 01:15:16.890
You're good.

01:16:49.949 --> 01:16:53.153
- You ready?
- Let's roll.

01:16:53.186 --> 01:16:54.588
Let's load up.

01:17:53.812 --> 01:17:57.115
- Purvis.
- Ms. Phair.

01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:59.886
It's a pleasure to see you again.

01:18:00.919 --> 01:18:03.155
I really wasn't expecting you.

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:05.992
I know.

01:18:19.238 --> 01:18:21.908
- Where are you?
<i>- In the office.</i>

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.775
It doesn't sound like the office.

01:18:23.809 --> 01:18:27.547
OK. Maybe I'm visiting an old friend.

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:30.550
Are you gonna be able to
handle this one without me?

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:33.953
Wait, you aren't coming?

01:18:33.985 --> 01:18:37.556
- Shit's about to get complicated.
- I like complicated.

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:39.693
Easy's boring.
