WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
(theme music playing )

00:26.611 --> 00:28.818
(yells)

00:30.656 --> 00:32.692
( cheering )

00:43.002 --> 00:45.664
( crowd chanting )
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

00:50.718 --> 00:53.004
( crowd continues chanting )

01:00.019 --> 01:02.806
It wounds my heart
to see a man once so elevated

01:02.980 --> 01:05.062
plummet to such depths.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.979
Your dog Ashur--

01:09.153 --> 01:11.144
was he always
upon your leash

01:11.322 --> 01:13.108
even when licking
my ass?

01:13.282 --> 01:14.943
His loyalty
never wavered.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.574
The man is most skilled
in deceit.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.487
Or perhaps you were too blinded
by envy to perceive the truth.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.496
Solonius:
You flatter yourself.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.953
Batiatus: Did you not have eyes
towards my ludus,

01:25.127 --> 01:27.709
my champions, my wife?

01:29.382 --> 01:31.213
( chuckles )

01:31.384 --> 01:34.217
You would steal glory
from the House of Batiatus,

01:34.387 --> 01:36.093
yet here you are

01:36.264 --> 01:39.131
with nothing but blood and sand
for your efforts.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.765
Capua will see you
for what you are.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.722
( laughs)

01:43.896 --> 01:46.057
The man who brought
the magistrate's murderer to justice,

01:46.232 --> 01:48.393
the hero of the people.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.104
May the gods protect me
from their wrath.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.520
( crowd cheering, stomping )

01:53.698 --> 01:55.563
( man screaming )

01:55.741 --> 01:59.984
Crixus makes quick work
of his opponent.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.369
I must return
to the pulvinus

02:02.540 --> 02:05.327
to announce
your execution.

02:07.253 --> 02:10.165
Well played, Batiatus.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.920
l underestimated you.

02:12.091 --> 02:16.380
You are not the first to die
for that mistake.

02:16.554 --> 02:20.046
( crowd chanting )
Kill! Kill! Kill! Ki||!

02:25.813 --> 02:28.225
( crowd cheering )

02:33.029 --> 02:38.399
(yells)

02:40.786 --> 02:42.777
Foryou!

02:45.583 --> 02:47.995
Crixus honors the memory
of your husband.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.785
As do we all.

02:50.963 --> 02:54.205
We should put these dark times
behind us...

02:56.552 --> 02:59.760
and with Solonius's blood

02:59.930 --> 03:02.512
mend our grief.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.140
Crowd: Crixus!

03:05.311 --> 03:07.768
( crowd chanting )
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

03:12.985 --> 03:15.067
( crowd continues chanting )

03:19.658 --> 03:21.649
| request words
with Batiatus,

03:21.827 --> 03:23.863
yet you return
absent the man.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.404
Other matters occupy
his attention.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.995
l've pressed for audience
all week.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.909
Dominus forgets
who his champion is.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.750
It is you
who forgets title--

03:34.924 --> 03:37.210
master and slave.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.464
Apologies.

03:44.642 --> 03:48.055
l have made many mistakes
since becoming champion.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.471
Know that I intend
to rectify them shortly.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.941
Good citizens of Capua!

04:06.789 --> 04:08.745
I stand before you,

04:08.916 --> 04:11.703
the sting of tears
yet hot upon my cheek,

04:11.877 --> 04:14.710
to redress
a most vile crime

04:14.880 --> 04:18.873
against our city
and our hearts--

04:19.051 --> 04:22.714
the murder
of Magistrate Titus Calavius--

04:22.888 --> 04:26.756
( crowd booing )

04:26.934 --> 04:29.016
--his life stolen

04:29.186 --> 04:31.393
for lust of profit

04:31.564 --> 04:33.395
and advancement,

04:33.566 --> 04:36.933
his warmth and guidance

04:37.111 --> 04:40.569
torn from our hands

04:40.739 --> 04:43.116
and those of loving wife

04:43.284 --> 04:47.277
and noble son.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.413
Yet today we shall
witness justice.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.084
The base criminal
that has so wounded us

04:55.254 --> 04:58.917
shall be executed
ad gladium.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.889
Enter Solonius,

05:06.056 --> 05:08.092
enemy of the people.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.689
Crowd: Fucking pig!

05:17.860 --> 05:20.192
Traitor!

05:23.282 --> 05:25.113
Slice his shriveled
cock off!

05:25.284 --> 05:27.400
You fucking pig!

05:27.578 --> 05:29.114
Fuck you!

05:36.670 --> 05:38.922
( crowd booing )

05:48.474 --> 05:50.590
And who shall balance
the scales?

05:50.768 --> 05:54.556
Who shall restore honor
to our city?

05:54.730 --> 05:58.314
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

05:58.484 --> 06:01.442
There is but one man,

06:01.612 --> 06:04.149
the slayer of Theokoles,

06:04.323 --> 06:06.484
the bringer of rain--

06:06.659 --> 06:09.071
Spartacus,

06:09.245 --> 06:11.452
champion of Capua!

06:11.622 --> 06:14.955
( crowd cheering )

06:33.310 --> 06:35.926
You survived your execution,
Thracian,

06:36.105 --> 06:38.391
upon these very sands.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.898
Perhaps good Solonius
will fare as well.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.897
I would not expect it.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.954
Begin.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.741
(yelling)

06:58.919 --> 07:01.160
Fight me, damn it.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.876
Why does Spartacus
not strike in return?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.716
He but extends the moment,
to the favor of the crowd.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.176
The villain's blood
will flow soon enough.

07:14.351 --> 07:18.060
Your husband has been
a gift from the gods.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.141
Numerius would be lost
without his support.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.523
He gains great comfort
in the act.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.274
The comfort is ours.

07:24.445 --> 07:28.939
He will make a fine father
when the day comes.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.072
Look, Spartacus draws blood.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.548
You are not absent skill.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.963
Nor desire to live.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.693
You see?
Solonius comes to his end.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.354
And who would not wish it?

08:10.532 --> 08:15.322
The streets of Rome are wet
with the tears of your loss.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.321
We have not received word
from you, llithyia.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.118
Did you speak
to your husband

08:23.295 --> 08:25.411
about patronage
for the House of Batiatus?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.250
At length.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.836
He comes to Capua
a day hence

08:30.010 --> 08:31.796
to discuss the matter
personally.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.324
The roar of the crowd--

08:56.495 --> 08:58.531
there's no sound
more glorious.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.998
The last you shall hear.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.124
You take the wrong life.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.254
Your master Batiatus
is the villain.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.668
And shall join you presently.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.057
(laughing)

09:20.227 --> 09:23.515
( crowd chanting )
Ki||! Ki||! Ki||! Ki||!

09:32.156 --> 09:34.863
( crowd cheering )

09:57.514 --> 09:59.050
Oh.

10:08.609 --> 10:12.727
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

10:24.875 --> 10:27.491
I would not have Agron risk himself
on behalf of brotherly bond.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.705
See him separated from Duro
in future games.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.086
And what of Spartacus?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.087
He grows restless
at not receiving audience.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.795
The proceedings with Solonius
have filled my attentions.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.221
Send Mira to occupy
his thoughts.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.764
lwill summon him
in the morning.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.138
Dominus.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.814
Robes fit for a man of breeding
and intelligence.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.770
You wear them well.

10:52.945 --> 10:56.278
Today beheld the end of Solonius--
a welcome spectacle

10:56.448 --> 10:58.939
given purchase
by your loyalty and cunning.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.574
You shall be removed
from the ludus immediately.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.831
Removed?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.613
You'll reside in the villa,

11:06.792 --> 11:08.999
elevated far above
the common men,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.911
your devious fucking mind
close to elbow.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.172
Gratitude seizes
thetongue.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.306
Well, perhaps a woman will aid
in the untangling of it.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.091
Name any slave,

11:26.270 --> 11:29.012
and the wet joys
of her body are yours.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.809
I confess
to certain longings...

11:34.987 --> 11:36.818
( Batiatus laughs )

11:36.989 --> 11:40.402
for one not yet soiled
by the other men.

11:40.576 --> 11:44.068
Give name to your desire
and see it fulfilled.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.832
Apologies.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.717
My presence
was commanded.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.554
By Batiatus?

12:04.725 --> 12:08.013
His words
set me to purpose,

12:08.186 --> 12:09.926
but they were
gladly received.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.733
I tend your wound,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.569
stand guard
at your request

12:22.743 --> 12:25.530
while you stain hands
with blood,

12:25.704 --> 12:29.037
and you discard
a simple touch?

12:34.212 --> 12:37.249
My mind is taken
with other thoughts.

12:48.894 --> 12:51.761
Then break open head
and share them.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.814
I fear Batiatus suspects my hand
in Aulus's death.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.442
He appears absent the weight
of pressing concern.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.605
Then why does he not
grant me audience?

13:05.577 --> 13:08.410
What secrets did Aulus reveal
in dying breath

13:08.580 --> 13:10.662
that so inflamed?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.999
That his hand
robbed Sura of life...

13:21.259 --> 13:23.636
by command of Batiatus.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.092
You plan vengeance?

13:36.692 --> 13:40.150
You cannot do this.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.526
Spartacus.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.653
That is not
what she called me.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.941
Never again will I hear her
whisper my true name

13:47.119 --> 13:50.031
or taste the joy of it
on her lips.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.411
I will see the light
fade from his eyes

13:54.584 --> 13:56.165
orjoin her
in the attempt.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.076
At expense of my life?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.965
The Thracian does not know
Roman law.

14:06.263 --> 14:10.632
If one slave spills
the blood of his master,

14:10.809 --> 14:12.800
all are put to death.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.896
Each to his own fate

14:21.069 --> 14:23.606
and lto mine.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.137
( laughs)

14:51.308 --> 14:54.425
You move
with strong purpose.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.936
Spurred by your victory.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.943
When I defeated Pericles

15:05.113 --> 15:07.775
and you were not
in the pulvinus...

15:11.828 --> 15:14.080
There is no meaning
to glory

15:14.247 --> 15:16.829
without your eyes
to witness it.

15:20.962 --> 15:24.170
They will never again
be absent.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.297
Lucretia: Naevia.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.136
Hurry.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.221
Quickly.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.062
Lucretia: Naevia.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.062
Domina.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.447
What business do you attend
that you do not answer?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.404
Fetching wine, Domina.
Apologies. I did not hear.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.114
Leaveit

15:55.288 --> 15:57.495
There is a service
required of you by Dominus.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.390
My heart quickens
at such a vision.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.934
Please.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.105
Set mind to ease.
I cling to no grudge

16:31.283 --> 16:33.615
for past transgressions.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.195
I do not understand.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.282
You spoke with Doctore

16:38.456 --> 16:42.119
after it was said
Barca secured his freedom.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.625
I told him nothing.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.127
A thing of no consequence.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.163
Turn it from your thoughts

16:48.341 --> 16:51.253
as l have turned it
from mine

16:51.428 --> 16:55.091
in favor of more...

16:55.265 --> 16:57.927
intimate concerns.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.301
l have admired your beauty

17:01.479 --> 17:04.471
for many years.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.061
Were you aware
of my affections?

17:07.235 --> 17:11.399
l have felt your gaze
linger of late.

17:12.991 --> 17:17.610
A gaze is all I could dare,

17:17.787 --> 17:19.652
your position placing you

17:19.831 --> 17:22.447
forever beyond my grasp,

17:22.626 --> 17:25.868
delicate,

17:26.046 --> 17:30.255
ripe Naevia,

17:30.425 --> 17:34.338
always the forbidden fruit--

17:34.512 --> 17:36.844
until now.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.641
You tremble.

17:44.814 --> 17:48.147
Has a man never kissed you,

17:48.318 --> 17:51.025
caressed the soft curves

17:51.196 --> 17:55.235
of your hips,

17:55.408 --> 17:58.866
slipped inside of you?

18:00.121 --> 18:03.363
Domina has seen me
remain untouched.

18:05.877 --> 18:09.540
Then we are both

18:09.714 --> 18:12.877
in her debt.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.147
Lucretia: You give her away
as if a common whore.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.485
l have preserved her chastity
since she was a child,

18:38.660 --> 18:40.571
towards presenting it
as gift.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.282
The only gift of chastity
is in its removal.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.321
By a man of worth,

18:45.500 --> 18:49.539
not fucking Ashur.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.546
Naevia has been
my most trusted slave.

18:52.716 --> 18:56.459
The thought of that
fucking Syrian

18:56.636 --> 18:58.968
shoving his devious cock
inside her--

18:59.139 --> 19:01.004
it's betrayal, Quintus.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.798
It is a necessity.
Set details of it aside

19:03.977 --> 19:07.515
and shift mind
to Glaber's arrival.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.772
His patronage brings to climax
all our labors.

19:12.444 --> 19:17.063
When the sun rises
on the House of Batiatus,

19:17.240 --> 19:19.322
everything will change.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.377
(yelling)

19:57.864 --> 19:59.070
( screams )

20:13.046 --> 20:16.959
Your wooden man gives almost
as much fight as Solonius.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.342
With each victory

20:21.513 --> 20:24.676
I draw closer to facing you again
in the arena

20:24.849 --> 20:26.464
and reclaiming
stolen glories.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.383
There is no glory,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.847
only blood

20:31.022 --> 20:32.978
spilled for the pleasure
of the Romans.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.185
And how they shall roar

20:35.360 --> 20:37.476
when l spill your blood
upon the sands.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.152
Spartacus, you are summoned.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.373
I fear you will never
have the chance.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.088
Batiatus: Watch what you're
fucking doing.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.378
Be careful with that.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.467
Man: Dominus.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.256
Where are the flowers?

21:08.435 --> 21:11.051
Go find the new girl
and bring the fucking flowers.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.221
A house full of slaves, have to do
fucking everything myself.

21:14.399 --> 21:17.061
Ah, the champion of Capua

21:17.235 --> 21:19.271
graces us with his presence.

21:19.446 --> 21:23.439
Apologies for not
receiving you sooner.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.403
l have been consumed with
the tumult of recent events.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.160
Much has changed.

21:30.331 --> 21:34.244
The world reforms
at our feet,

21:34.419 --> 21:37.081
the very earth thrusting us
to unimaginable heights.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.500
At great cost.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.589
Batiatus: Easily paid.
At this very moment

21:45.763 --> 21:47.674
Legatus Glaber

21:47.849 --> 21:50.135
thunders towards us
to bestow patronage.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.802
I know your feelings
towards the man.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.016
I would ask
that they be put aside

21:56.191 --> 21:59.934
in favor of more
noble pursuits.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.192
Glaber took Sura
from my arms,

22:05.366 --> 22:08.984
but he is not the man
that took her life.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.537
Aurelia?

22:20.632 --> 22:23.715
- Would that be all?
- Yeah, fine. Leave.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.591
What is she doing here?

22:25.762 --> 22:28.128
Working beneath my employ
to pay off Varro's debts.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.171
l pledged my winnings
to such a cause.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.591
- You did not tell her this?
- Of course.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.431
She would have no coin
from your purse nor mine

22:35.605 --> 22:39.143
unless it was obtained
by means of fair labor.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.683
She wishes to serve
the House of Batiatus

22:41.861 --> 22:44.853
until all his debts
are balanced.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.363
She is a good woman

22:47.534 --> 22:49.570
and worthy of consideration.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.826
And she shall receive it
in abundance.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.659
Now tell me, what matter were you
so eager to discuss with me?

22:55.833 --> 22:58.449
l merely sought word
towards Varro's wife,

22:58.628 --> 23:01.461
and that she had been
provided for.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.291
ExceHent

23:06.469 --> 23:09.552
So all is well between us?

23:18.856 --> 23:21.188
I require words
with Spartacus.

23:21.359 --> 23:24.021
Why the fuck
would I allow that?

23:24.195 --> 23:26.060
Because my tongue
remains silent

23:26.239 --> 23:28.195
towards the gate key
youlost

23:28.366 --> 23:30.778
You would have it
remain so?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.318
Be quick.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.413
Opportunity presents itself,
yet Batiatus lives.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.544
For the moment.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.422
Last night the lives of every slave
under this roof

23:46.593 --> 23:48.379
meant nothing to you.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.794
Then Aurelia appears
and you grow a conscience.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.884
Varro was as a brother.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.014
I will not see his wife
put at risk.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.848
You put the woman at risk
when you killed her husband.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.743
Crixus.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.539
A parting gift.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.335
What is this shit?

24:28.509 --> 24:31.467
A memento of your battle
with Theokoles.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.220
The city was filled
with such novelties

24:34.390 --> 24:37.052
after Spartacus
brought the rains.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.433
The craftsmanship
was rather poor.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.014
Dominus finally decides

24:41.189 --> 24:43.020
to remove you
from the company of men?

24:43.191 --> 24:45.273
Far removed.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.603
I've been given
favored quarters within the villa

24:49.781 --> 24:53.444
to serve as our master's
ﬁghthand.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.199
The one he wipes
his ass with.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.157
Ah, a witty turn of phrase,

24:58.331 --> 25:02.074
one of many splendors
I shall miss of being a gladiator.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.742
You were never a gladiator.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.497
No.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.168
Not after your blade
found itself in my leg.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.632
My gift to you.

25:15.807 --> 25:19.550
One that has given
great reward.

25:25.066 --> 25:28.558
Everything I am,
everything I now possess

25:28.736 --> 25:31.022
I owe to you.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.659
No, that goes
to the balcony.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.995
Quickly.
The legatus arrives.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.376
The new girl
is slow to the task.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.412
An act of charity.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.842
We shall yet find
proper use for her.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.261
A great day, Dominus,

25:54.429 --> 25:56.420
one that shall be
remembered.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.510
- Where is the legatus?
- Apologies.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.600
My husband is delayed.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.685
But you made promise.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.067
Which will be well kept.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.273
He yet intends proper visit,

26:13.448 --> 26:16.986
but requests good Batiatus
give greeting upon entering the city.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.867
A great honor.
When does he arrive?

26:20.037 --> 26:21.493
Now.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.581
We must hurry.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.960
Come.

26:30.131 --> 26:33.043
Let us retire to the balcony
to feast

26:33.217 --> 26:35.003
and review your sense
of timing.

26:35.178 --> 26:37.544
I would love
nothing more,

26:37.722 --> 26:40.338
but I must return
to the villa

26:40.516 --> 26:42.177
to gather
my belongings.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.636
To what end?

26:43.811 --> 26:46.302
I'm moving back to Rome.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.480
But your stay in Capua
has been so brief.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.687
Painfully.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.478
Yet now that my husband
campaigns for praetor,

26:55.656 --> 26:57.908
he insists I remain
at his side.

27:00.161 --> 27:01.651
Are you well?

27:01.829 --> 27:03.911
The blood drains
from your cheeks.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.323
My heart
but flutters at the--

27:07.502 --> 27:10.710
thethought
of losing you.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.041
Memories of our
time together

27:13.216 --> 27:17.380
will fade
only with difficulty.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.839
Your friendship, Lucretia,

27:20.014 --> 27:22.426
has forever altered my life.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.825
Spartacus,
I would make request.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.461
Ask another,
if you seek it granted.

27:54.632 --> 27:57.374
It is not for me,
but for my brother.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.423
Batiatus orders us parted.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.183
Duro greets the news
with a laugh and fucking smile.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.721
Yet I fear he shall not
survive the arena on his own.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.185
You are not alone
in the thought.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.646
Batiatus shows you
much favor.

28:16.821 --> 28:21.030
A word from your lips
could see the decision undone.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.862
Batiatus favors no one
but himself.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.471
Man:
Yeah! The legatus!

29:02.533 --> 29:04.990
Legatus Glaber,

29:05.161 --> 29:07.197
your arrival honors
the fair city of Capua.

29:07.371 --> 29:10.408
An honor I expected matched
by greeting at the gate.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.165
Apologies.
I had thought--

29:13.336 --> 29:15.042
Let us move past it.

29:15.212 --> 29:18.955
My ears burn with reports
of lawlessness since last I visited.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.249
The magistrate's murder
was unfortunate.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.884
As was that of Ovidius
and his family.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.547
And now the cousin of Senator Crassus
goes missing.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.306
Let us retire to my villa

29:29.477 --> 29:31.342
and we can discuss these
and other matters at length.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.557
I prefer to speak
with someone in authority.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.723
- Good Mercato awaits.
- I shall accompany you.

29:36.901 --> 29:40.268
That won't be necessary.
Await me at your villa.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.903
- When shall I expect you?
- When I arrive.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.737
Guard:
Crixus, you are summoned.

29:51.749 --> 29:55.241
I long for the night, to continue
what was last interrupted.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.001
I cannot meet you.

29:58.172 --> 30:02.085
'Tis but one night.
There's no cause for this.

30:02.259 --> 30:08.220
Yes, cause enough to drown
us both in tears.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.760
Dominus has given me
to another.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.564
Who?

30:18.734 --> 30:21.146
Tell me his name.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.106
What does it matter?

30:23.280 --> 30:26.898
We have lived in a dream
and now we must awaken.

30:32.415 --> 30:35.407
Do not be troubled,
mighty Crixus.

30:36.919 --> 30:39.501
Capua cheers your name
once more.

30:40.965 --> 30:43.456
Soon you will seize
the mantle of champion

30:43.634 --> 30:45.716
from that fucking Thracian

30:45.886 --> 30:48.263
and everything shall be
as it was

30:48.431 --> 30:50.046
before you fell
to Theokoles.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.966
I long for it to be so.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.345
As do |.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.693
Something's wrong.

31:09.452 --> 31:11.864
Apologies, Domina.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.575
( moans)

31:15.708 --> 31:17.994
Naevia.

31:24.467 --> 31:27.334
That shitfuck beckons me
to the city

31:27.511 --> 31:29.547
only to spurn me
like a thin-waisted whore.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.929
Once again the gods
spread the cheeks

31:32.099 --> 31:34.590
to ram cock
in fucking ass.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.555
Perhaps a gentle nudge,

31:36.729 --> 31:38.720
to remind the legatus
of your importance?

31:38.898 --> 31:41.014
Make the arrangements.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.353
Glaber will bend
to my fucking will

31:43.527 --> 31:45.904
or break
in the denying of it.

31:46.072 --> 31:49.155
Lucretia, you need to have
fucking words with llithyia.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.780
What's happened?

31:55.081 --> 31:57.914
lam with child.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.870
You're to be a father,
Quintus.

32:05.466 --> 32:08.003
Wine. Wine for
the fucking house, eh?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.792
We must celebrate.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.057
We must celebrate.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.432
(thunder rumbling)

32:19.730 --> 32:22.016
This fucking village!

32:23.943 --> 32:25.479
Finally.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.268
I had feared you absorbed
for the night.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.779
The curse
of Mercato's incompetence.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.191
Cousin of Crassus vanishes,

32:33.369 --> 32:36.111
and no theory rattles around
in his empty head.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.246
Theories pale
against the obvious.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.873
Licinia's tongue
was suspected of lounging

32:42.044 --> 32:43.830
in less esteemed places

32:44.004 --> 32:46.962
than around
her husband's cock,

32:47.133 --> 32:48.748
whereas mine
has made do

32:48.926 --> 32:52.089
with naught
but idle conversation.

32:52.263 --> 32:55.881
I fear it may not
have been as idle

32:56.058 --> 32:59.221
as you would
have me believe.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.762
What promises have you made
Batiatus and his faded bitch?

33:02.940 --> 33:05.977
The fleshmonger looks
to me with rheumy eyes

33:06.152 --> 33:08.017
brimming with expectation.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.481
I promised nothing

33:10.656 --> 33:13.398
save word
on their behalf

33:13.576 --> 33:18.445
to my dearly missed
husband.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.329
Batiatus is little better

33:21.500 --> 33:24.037
than the beasts
that bear his mark.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.748
( giggles ) True,

33:26.922 --> 33:29.504
but they do provide
a certain amusement.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.382
( chuckles )

33:33.888 --> 33:36.470
Humor their intent.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.848
No more can be asked
from a man of your station.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.686
My promise discharged,

33:44.857 --> 33:47.314
and we shall return
to Rome

33:47.484 --> 33:49.941
and more civilized
company.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.836
Fetch another.

34:13.010 --> 34:15.342
And hold on to it
this time.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.511
Aurelia,

34:21.685 --> 34:25.018
I beg a moment

34:25.189 --> 34:27.020
alone.

34:31.654 --> 34:34.020
You cannot be
under the care of Batiatus.

34:34.198 --> 34:36.655
- The deed is done.
- Then I shall see it undone.

34:36.825 --> 34:40.443
- My winnings in the arena--
- Are not fucking wanted.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.988
Varro asked
that | see you taken care of.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.122
Then return him to me.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.830
(thunder rumbling)

34:51.840 --> 34:54.627
Varro's son--

34:54.802 --> 34:56.884
he is safe?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.919
He stays with my brother

34:59.098 --> 35:01.054
to be raised
free of his father's debt.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.216
Absent his mother.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.769
What of the child in carry?

35:09.858 --> 35:12.395
It was not fathered
by Varro.

35:14.405 --> 35:17.738
Without him |--

35:21.662 --> 35:24.278
I had it removed
from my concerns,

35:24.456 --> 35:26.833
as I would be
from yours.

35:28.419 --> 35:31.661
Batiatus is not
to be trusted.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.079
Do not lay faith in him.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.839
My husband is dead,

35:36.010 --> 35:39.047
and with him all faith.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.011
Batiatus:
As your eyes witness,

35:49.189 --> 35:51.566
no coin has been spared
in restoring the villa.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.020
All will marvel
upon privileged entry

35:54.194 --> 35:56.105
and be humbled
by the storied history

35:56.280 --> 35:57.895
of the House of Batiatus.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.938
Glaber:
It is a vast improvement.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.779
Mm, the gods have truly
blessed them.

36:02.953 --> 36:05.114
And continue to do so.

36:05.289 --> 36:07.405
lf fortune so favors,
why do you continue

36:07.583 --> 36:09.119
to press so brazenly
for my support?

36:09.293 --> 36:12.581
True fortune extends no further
than a man's ambitions.

36:12.755 --> 36:15.792
Mine stretch well beyond
the sands in the arena.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.298
How far beyond?

36:18.469 --> 36:21.552
To the very doors
of political office...

36:22.556 --> 36:24.842
in a minor capacity
at first.

36:25.893 --> 36:29.806
Well, let us entertain it
for a moment.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.266
What men of status
lend you their confidence?

36:32.441 --> 36:35.478
Magistrate Calavius
had voiced his endorsement.

36:35.652 --> 36:38.689
before the coward Solonius
forever stilled his tongue.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.650
Base villain.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.816
The way he would stare,
with his teeth.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.827
Glaber: My heart is moved
by the tragedy,

36:46.997 --> 36:51.286
yet my head
remains fixed.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.748
What advantage would I gain
by association with a lanista?

36:54.922 --> 36:58.506
My gladiators ignite
the passion of the crowd.

36:58.675 --> 37:02.338
Lend name to my cause
and see their deafening cheers

37:02.513 --> 37:06.097
transformed into demands
for Claudius Glaber

37:06.266 --> 37:10.726
and his desired position
of praetor.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.191
They do favor Batiatus's men
like no others,

37:18.362 --> 37:20.899
especially Spartacus.

37:23.117 --> 37:25.984
The Thracian.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.368
And what does it say
that your finest gladiator

37:28.539 --> 37:30.655
was my worst soldier?

37:30.833 --> 37:34.041
That I am the greatest
lanista in the republic,

37:34.211 --> 37:37.294
for l have taken a wild beast
and forged him into a god.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.125
It's a bold claim.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.587
Built on a foundation
of fucking granite.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.843
I would see your words
made flesh.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.674
Easily conjured.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.885
Spartacus trains in the square
with the other men.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.436
l have descended into the bowels
of your ludus once before

37:51.603 --> 37:53.719
and did not care
for the stench.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.558
Summon the Thracian
to the villa,

37:55.732 --> 37:57.393
along with the rest
of your men.

37:57.568 --> 37:59.308
All of them?

38:00.362 --> 38:01.898
All of them.

38:22.593 --> 38:24.709
The champion of Capua.

38:26.263 --> 38:28.219
A sad day
when an honored city

38:28.390 --> 38:31.257
elevates a cur
to such position.

38:35.772 --> 38:39.230
| see you've taught the animal
not to speak out of turn.

38:41.612 --> 38:43.193
And I would have
demonstration

38:43.363 --> 38:46.651
of other tricks
the Thracian has learned.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.907
Unchain him.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.828
Which of my men
would you have oppose him?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.462
None.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.248
Formation!

39:15.145 --> 39:17.136
Spartacus wields
practice swords.

39:17.314 --> 39:19.430
I fear he's
at a disadvantage.

39:19.608 --> 39:23.351
l but give him chance
to prove his legend.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.440
lovis.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.870
How exciting.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.626
Begin.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.852
Vesper. Linus.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.445
Legatus.

40:08.615 --> 40:12.278
You opened this door, lanista,
and we shall pass through it.

41:36.328 --> 41:38.319
( chuckles )

42:27.546 --> 42:31.835
Behold, the legend is proved.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.795
Dominus.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.171
This savage caused Rome
great offense,

42:39.349 --> 42:43.638
yet it would appear
that you have broken the man.

42:44.646 --> 42:49.106
The way he bows
his head in deference--

42:49.276 --> 42:52.234
would I be afforded
such courtesies, lwonder,

42:52.404 --> 42:54.895
if patronage
were awarded?

42:55.073 --> 42:58.691
He would be yours to command,
as would all my men.

43:01.204 --> 43:03.195
Kneel

43:03.373 --> 43:05.204
and it shall be so.

43:18.805 --> 43:20.545
Legatus.

43:57.427 --> 43:58.758
(yelling)

44:00.222 --> 44:02.258
Crixus!

44:03.517 --> 44:05.553
You fucking cunt!

44:08.772 --> 44:10.854
Calm yourself.

44:11.024 --> 44:14.107
Slaves running wild-- this is what you
would have me give name towards?

44:14.277 --> 44:16.438
What seizes
your fucking wits?

44:16.613 --> 44:18.023
- Speak!
- Crixus: Let me go!

44:18.198 --> 44:21.531
l yet but touch my gift,
and Crixus goes mad.

44:21.701 --> 44:25.364
I felt her maidenhood long absent
when we lay together.

44:25.539 --> 44:29.407
Now I know whose cock
was in her first.

44:33.088 --> 44:34.794
Crixus:
|'|| fucking ki||--!

44:34.965 --> 44:37.297
You whore!

44:37.467 --> 44:39.958
How long?
How fucking long?

44:40.136 --> 44:43.799
How long have you hidden laughter
behind a polite smile?

44:43.974 --> 44:46.966
How long have you been
luring him

44:47.143 --> 44:50.055
to your filthy
slave cunt?

44:54.609 --> 44:57.476
What is it?
What is it?

44:57.654 --> 45:00.316
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

45:03.869 --> 45:05.609
How did you come by it?

45:05.787 --> 45:07.152
I took it.

45:07.330 --> 45:11.790
To open the gate,
so you could lie with Crixus.

45:11.960 --> 45:15.327
You alone knew
of my feelings for him,

45:15.505 --> 45:18.167
and yet you betray me.

45:22.470 --> 45:25.132
Crixus never loved you.

45:25.307 --> 45:27.548
He did only as commanded.

45:35.942 --> 45:37.853
Mira.

45:38.028 --> 45:39.893
Domina.

45:44.034 --> 45:46.650
Bring me a knife.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.330
You have assurance
Crixus will be punished.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.913
I fear your hands
too soft for the task.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.043
You are mistaken.

45:58.214 --> 46:01.206
They are as steel,
hardened to their purpose.

46:01.384 --> 46:02.999
Glaber: As | to mine.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.794
We return to Rome, absent
unworthy entanglements.

46:05.972 --> 46:07.678
Do not turn from me!

46:07.849 --> 46:09.840
You forget your place,
lanista.

46:10.018 --> 46:12.680
No, l secure it.

46:12.854 --> 46:14.060
Clear the fucking room.

46:14.230 --> 46:17.939
Tell Ashur to bring our gift
for the legatus.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.486
Forget your gifts.

46:20.654 --> 46:24.567
I would part as from a troubling dream,
untethered by the memory of it.

46:24.741 --> 46:26.151
Oh, you will remember
this day

46:26.326 --> 46:28.191
until you lay to slumber,
never to awaken.

46:28.370 --> 46:32.613
I fear we have let events
run the best of us.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.372
Perhaps a cup of wine
to cool the head.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.750
We are long past
civilized recourse.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.958
Your husband presses issue.
I would see it closed.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.839
As would I.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.251
You cannot believe
this will make a difference.

46:46.429 --> 46:48.385
Open it and see.

46:52.811 --> 46:55.143
( llithyia gasps )

46:55.313 --> 46:58.271
What is this abomination?

46:58.441 --> 47:00.397
But a piece of the whole--

47:00.568 --> 47:03.776
Licinia, cousin of Crassus.

47:03.947 --> 47:06.279
You murdered Licinia?

47:06.449 --> 47:08.405
No.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.407
Your wife did.

47:10.578 --> 47:11.909
He lies.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.493
A most heinous act,
one l was content to help obscure

47:15.667 --> 47:19.000
under promise of her aid
in obtaining your favor.

47:19.170 --> 47:23.664
Now I fear Licinia's body
may resurface,

47:23.842 --> 47:26.174
on the grounds
of your villa perhaps.

47:26.344 --> 47:29.552
I will see the tongue ripped
from your fucking mouth.

47:29.723 --> 47:32.135
Even so ruined,
it would yet speak the truth.

47:32.308 --> 47:34.139
Claudius,

47:34.310 --> 47:37.473
you cannot believe me
capable of such a thing.

47:55.331 --> 47:57.788
Patronage is granted.

47:57.959 --> 48:00.291
A portion of my men
will remain stationed

48:00.462 --> 48:04.296
against further
em barrassments.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.841
Make all other arrangements
with llithyia.

48:09.012 --> 48:10.843
She will be remaining
here in Capua.

48:11.014 --> 48:12.925
No.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.369
No man is above retribution

48:37.540 --> 48:40.623
for offenses committed
against the House of Batiatus--

48:40.794 --> 48:42.534
no gladiator,

48:42.712 --> 48:44.998
no champion,

48:45.173 --> 48:48.506
even the men that guard you,
should they be guilty

48:48.676 --> 48:52.214
of deceit or incompetence.

48:52.388 --> 48:54.424
Hector found
his key removed.

48:54.599 --> 48:57.557
His head follows.

48:57.727 --> 49:00.059
The fault lies
in my own breast,

49:00.230 --> 49:02.892
with heart grown
too large.

49:03.066 --> 49:04.931
This cannot stand.

49:05.110 --> 49:07.726
Legatus Claudius Glaber

49:07.904 --> 49:10.361
is now our honored patron.

49:10.532 --> 49:15.026
And he has opened my eyes
to the error of my generosity,

49:15.203 --> 49:18.286
one that demands correction.

49:23.336 --> 49:25.418
Embrace the pain.

49:25.588 --> 49:27.249
It is the only way.

49:47.610 --> 49:49.350
( screams )

49:54.951 --> 49:57.067
( Crixus screaming )

50:22.437 --> 50:26.146
I expect your meetings
with Crixus to end.

50:28.818 --> 50:30.024
Quintus--

50:30.195 --> 50:32.277
Do not fucking speak.

50:34.490 --> 50:38.153
That you would think me a fool
is insult enough.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.036
l have always known

50:43.208 --> 50:45.449
and turned eye away
only because it made you happy

50:45.627 --> 50:47.663
and caused me
no thought.

50:47.837 --> 50:50.544
Those days have ended.

50:52.008 --> 50:55.421
Set your attentions
towards our child

50:55.595 --> 50:57.927
and do not
see them stray.

50:58.097 --> 51:00.133
Enough!

51:09.901 --> 51:12.233
(Crixus moaning )

51:17.784 --> 51:19.820
Naevia: Crixus!

51:20.870 --> 51:23.532
Crixus!

51:23.706 --> 51:25.662
Grant them a moment.

51:25.833 --> 51:29.041
He was our champion once.
Allow him such respect.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.716
l have destroyed us.

51:46.896 --> 51:48.887
We yet live.

51:49.065 --> 51:51.181
Where do they take you?

51:51.359 --> 51:53.065
I do not know.

51:56.489 --> 51:58.571
I will win my freedom.

51:58.741 --> 52:01.574
lwill not rest
until I find you.

52:01.744 --> 52:03.826
It is time.

52:11.004 --> 52:13.791
He speaks of freedom
as did Barca.

52:17.135 --> 52:20.377
No, you must not let him
broach the subject.

52:22.265 --> 52:24.347
Barca was not freed.

52:24.517 --> 52:26.974
Batiatus took his life.

52:37.113 --> 52:39.479
Fuck ass,
you Roman cock.

52:42.368 --> 52:44.450
Shut your fucking mouth.

52:44.620 --> 52:47.111
I would caution
softer words.

52:47.290 --> 52:51.374
The shit keeps rising higher
in this fucking hole.

52:51.544 --> 52:54.126
Perhaps it's best
not to be present

52:54.297 --> 52:57.289
when it fills the mouth.

52:58.968 --> 53:00.879
What do you speak of?

53:01.054 --> 53:02.635
I speak of nothing.

53:02.805 --> 53:06.889
Nothing sounds
much like escape.

53:08.061 --> 53:09.972
And how would nothing
find way

53:10.146 --> 53:13.013
past Batiatus
and all his fucking Romans?

53:14.817 --> 53:18.560
There is but one path.

53:18.738 --> 53:20.729
We kill them all.

53:25.536 --> 53:25.570
(theme music playing )

53:25.578 --> 53:27.819
(theme music playing )
