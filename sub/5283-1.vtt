01:19.479 --> 01:20.878
I love you,

01:22.449 --> 01:24.747
and I have a condom.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.486
-Matt, I shouldn't be here.
-Come on, Anna.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.423
-No. No.
-Come on, it'll be fun.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.620
I really shouldn't be here.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.289
Anna. Come on.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.695
I'm at a party,

01:45.371 --> 01:47.805
but all I want to do is get home.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.245
Hey, where you going? Anna?

03:12.492 --> 03:13.891
Don't go home.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.670
And then I hear my mother's bell.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.804
I go to find her.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.645
When she got sick,
we moved her into the boathouse.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.114
It's where she wanted to be.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.289
She's alone.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.018
She's not supposed to be alone.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.566
Anna.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.467
I run up to the house to find my dad.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.116
There's something wrong.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.351
It doesn't feel safe.

04:22.328 --> 04:26.025
There's something evil in the house.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.475
One way or another,
these dreams seem to be

04:41.547 --> 04:44.175
about trying to get out of the woods
and back home.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.512
Yeah.

04:45.585 --> 04:50.522
And when I get there, it's like
Mom's trying to tell me something.

04:50.590 --> 04:54.424
But I can't understand what it is,
what she's trying to say.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.860
Well, we've talked about
the little redheaded girl,

04:56.963 --> 05:00.228
but now there's a new detail,
the watering can.

05:00.833 --> 05:04.200
Why do you think you were holding it?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.461
I don't know.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.038
I really don't remember.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.908
Maybe you were trying
to put out the fire.

05:18.484 --> 05:23.717
When my mom first got sick,
she said that she'd always be there.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.722
Could be a stray cat,
or just the sound of the wind,

05:27.794 --> 05:31.821
but it would always be her.
She'd always protect us, you know.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.626
But...

05:39.439 --> 05:43.034
But the night of the fire,
I couldn't protect her.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.633
Smart girl.

05:44.711 --> 05:48.670
If I'm so smart, why can't I remember
what happened that night?

05:51.951 --> 05:54.852
Okay. Here's what I think.

05:56.589 --> 06:02.425
We survive by remembering,
but sometimes we survive by forgetting.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.888
You lost your mother in a tragic fire.

06:05.965 --> 06:10.595
Your life was changed forever by,
what, a broken fuel valve?

06:10.670 --> 06:13.036
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing to forget.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.097
-But what about the dream?
-It's a dream.

06:15.174 --> 06:18.200
You'll figure it out, or you won't.
That's how it all works.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.336
It's a process, Anna.

06:20.413 --> 06:24.907
What's it been? Ten months?
And you're almost finished.

06:24.984 --> 06:28.283
But you're not gonna get there
in a place like this.

06:30.656 --> 06:34.683
-Do you think I'm ready to leave?
-What else do you want from me?

06:36.662 --> 06:40.393
Go home. Kiss a boy, get into trouble.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.169
Finish what you started.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.081
Hi.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.025
One minute.

07:12.498 --> 07:16.127
Pretty little Anna.
Going home, sweet home.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.726
I'll be lonely.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.769
I really gotta go.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.075
There was so much blood,
wasn't there, Anna?

07:25.411 --> 07:27.106
Do you really think they fixed you?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.738
Come on, honey.
Let the girl pack her things.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.215
What have we told you about
wandering in here all the time?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.081
They couldn't fix me.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.756
Who will I tell my stories to?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.155
I've got a surprise for you.

08:16.229 --> 08:20.222
-Look in the glove compartment.
-Tell me it's a cheeseburger.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.698
Not quite.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.695
-You finished it.
-Yeah. Look inside.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.874
-Thank you, Dad.
-You're very welcome.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.809
Is it any good?

08:37.884 --> 08:40.818
Well, I don't know,
but I'm sure you'll tell me.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.421
I know something that's good.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.754
Oh, awesome. Thank you.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.256
Yeah, Rachel made them.

08:55.167 --> 08:59.069
She was gonna come today,
but I told her I wanted you all to myself.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.162
She's been great, Anna.
Really, she has been.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.265
I don't know what I would've...

09:02.341 --> 09:04.935
-Dad. You got me to yourself.
-...done without her.

09:33.606 --> 09:34.698
Alex?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.853
Anna. You're back.

10:30.129 --> 10:35.260
You're early. I'd hug you, but l...
Welcome home.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.860
You look great. You look so skinny.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.498
I think I could use some time
at that place.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.373
My first order of business
is fattening her up.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.378
I've already started with him.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.874
Yeah, she's been cooking all day.

10:49.949 --> 10:54.386
-Making... Oh, what are you making?
-Beef Stroganoff. Your favorite.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.751
So, you have a house
full of women now, Mr. Writer.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.387
-Did your dad tell you my idea?
-No.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.021
About the party.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.793
We thought we could throw you
a "Welcome Home, Anna" bash.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.266
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.303
Well, everybody's
been asking about you.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.430
-We've got all summer. There's no rush.
-No.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.769
Okay, I'm gonna go down to the water.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.445
I blew it.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.101
Anna.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.769
Just like it never happened, huh?

12:25.845 --> 12:28.939
Alex. Oh, I missed you so much.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.954
So, what do you think?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.790
You know, he had them
working weekends

12:38.858 --> 12:41.588
so it'd be finished
by the time you got back.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.855
Welcome to your new ward.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.194
Better food, crazier people.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.170
-When did she move in?
-Guess.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.040
First, she was helping
with the accident inquiry,

12:56.108 --> 12:59.134
and then she was helping
with the funeral.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.681
Now, she's helping him cope.
Three times a night.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.979
Whatever.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.683
Hey, thanks a lot, by the way.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.147
For what?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.520
-Deserting me.
-Alex!

13:15.594 --> 13:17.221
You know, I was stuck here
with those two

13:17.296 --> 13:19.491
while you went off
searching for your inner psycho.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.294
Alex, you don't know
what it was like in there.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.426
She was my mother, too.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.433
You know, you could've at least
written me back.

13:28.507 --> 13:29.701
What are you talking about?

13:29.775 --> 13:31.800
The playlists I made you,
the letters I wrote.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.471
I didn't get anything, Alex. I swear.

13:34.914 --> 13:38.042
Maybe Dr. Silberling
didn't want me to see them.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.885
No, it wasn't Dr. Silberling.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.946
Oh, he's such an asshole!

13:48.127 --> 13:50.288
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

13:50.362 --> 13:52.159
Those were my letters, Dad.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.860
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell her
about your new little girlfriend?

13:55.935 --> 13:59.837
Was that it?
T alk about all the dirty little secrets?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.140
And it was a mistake for you
to move her in here,

14:02.208 --> 14:05.644
and our whole stupid town
just loves talking about it.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.978
You disgust me.

14:15.754 --> 14:18.951
-Alex, where are you going?
-As if anybody cares.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.869
You caught me.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.143
Come here. You can hug me now.
I'm clean.

14:48.287 --> 14:51.688
Listen, Anna, I know the rules state

14:51.757 --> 14:54.590
that you're supposed to hate
Dad's new girlfriend,

14:54.660 --> 14:58.061
but I'm really hoping that
we can be more original than that

14:58.163 --> 15:00.063
and make this work.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.266
-Sure.
-Yeah.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.831
-Something's different.
-Oh, yeah, we painted.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.309
I really love all the wallpaper
in the house,

15:12.378 --> 15:15.142
but the kitchen just needed
some brightening up.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.738
There used to be something here.

15:16.815 --> 15:20.808
-Did there?
-Yeah, a chalkboard?

15:20.886 --> 15:23.150
Oh, yeah, the chalkboard.

15:23.222 --> 15:26.282
It must be up in the attic
with all the other old stuff.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.293
I think I figured
we didn't need one anymore.

15:32.164 --> 15:35.622
So, what do you think?
Do you wanna help set the table?

15:37.870 --> 15:40.498
No, I'm okay.
I'm not really hungry anyway.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.443
Alex?

20:10.108 --> 20:11.837
What are you doing?

20:15.314 --> 20:20.115
So, was that you or Nursie
in the throes of ecstasy?

20:20.185 --> 20:22.619
-I don't know.
-Okay.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.787
You drunk?

20:24.856 --> 20:27.825
Well, I went to a party
and drinks were served.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.396
-Where did you find that?
-Upstairs.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.991
What the hell are you doing with it?

20:37.069 --> 20:42.063
-I don't know. It was in the attic and...
-Okay. Well, that's where it should stay.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.205
-I hate that bell.
-Why?

20:45.677 --> 20:47.611
It reminds me of Mom.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.438
We needed it, Alex.

20:50.515 --> 20:53.643
That's how she'd call for help
after she got sick.

20:53.719 --> 20:57.211
Anna, wake up. Rachel bought the bell.

20:57.956 --> 20:58.980
What are you saying?

20:59.057 --> 21:01.457
She went into a goddamn pet store,
bought a bell,

21:01.526 --> 21:04.154
came home,
and tied it around Mom's wrist.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.499
And do you know why?

21:08.567 --> 21:13.971
So that she could hear Mom coming
while she was busy riding Dad.

21:14.039 --> 21:18.100
-You're making that up.
-Okay. Why would I do that?

21:18.176 --> 21:19.200
To get back at Dad.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.441
Trust me, Anna,
I'm way past getting back at Dad.

21:24.049 --> 21:29.681
You know, I might be drunk,
but at least I know what the truth is.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.624
Oh, here comes the burrito.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.937
Maybe try a sledgehammer next time.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.745
-Sorry.
-Looks good to me.

21:57.382 --> 22:00.977
Great, actually.
Just what our little kitchen needed.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.277
Isn't it, though?

22:04.122 --> 22:06.454
-I'm out of here.
-Cool.

22:06.525 --> 22:11.462
You know, Anna, I remember when
I first came here to look after your mom.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.095
I showed up at the house,

22:15.167 --> 22:17.465
and Alex was doing
her bitchy teenager thing,

22:17.536 --> 22:19.595
disrespecting your father.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.072
But you were different.

22:23.775 --> 22:28.337
Quiet, you know? Polite.
A proper little lady.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.280
I remember thinking,

22:31.350 --> 22:37.016
"Still waters run deep in this one.
She's the strong one."

22:39.925 --> 22:42.291
When I was your age,

22:42.361 --> 22:48.322
I had to deal with some rough things,
like you, and I learned to be strong.

22:49.634 --> 22:52.000
To be a girl nobody fucked with.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.302
I am so glad to have you back.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.435
I hope it works out so you can stay.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.410
Thanks. I intend to.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.318
Did you see her face?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.822
It was like
you totally jacked her Barbie kitchen.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.949
I was swinging the hammer
with my eyes closed.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.117
That is so awesome.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.161
It's our chalkboard. It should be there.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.787
Remember Mom
would leave messages on it?

23:18.864 --> 23:19.888
Soccer practices.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.934
Oh, but her handwriting was so bad.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.929
Pinkie pact?

23:36.681 --> 23:38.672
Am l, like, really pale?

23:39.317 --> 23:41.808
Yeah, you're pretty much,
like, see-through.

23:44.389 --> 23:47.552
Well, hopefully your future husband
won't notice.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.761
No, you are not leaving me here.

23:52.831 --> 23:56.198
-What are sisters for?
-Alex, don't you dare!

24:10.248 --> 24:12.182
-Hey, Matt.
-Hey.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.318
-So how you been?
-Yeah. Okay.

24:20.358 --> 24:24.021
You know, I really wanted to visit you
up there, but they wouldn't let me.

24:24.095 --> 24:28.361
Well, you should've slit your wrists, too.
We could've been roommates.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.794
She's back.

24:31.870 --> 24:35.362
-So, listen, that night at the beach...
-No, no. Listen...

24:35.440 --> 24:38.034
I was nervous, okay?
So I drank a bunch,

24:38.109 --> 24:40.600
and no one has ever accused me
of being smart,

24:40.679 --> 24:43.341
so I was dumb and drunk.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.346
But I was worried about you.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.682
I even went looking for you.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.685
What do you mean?

24:54.993 --> 24:57.621
I followed you home that night, Anna.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.488
I was here. I saw everything.

25:01.566 --> 25:04.592
Running a little late, aren't you, Matt?

25:11.710 --> 25:14.076
-Thanks. That's all we need.
-Okay.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.905
-I'll just... I'll see you around.
-Bye.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.329
Why don't you bring these supplies
up to the generator room?

25:32.397 --> 25:34.922
And then come up.
Your father's starved.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.067
-Your agent called today.
-Really?

26:18.143 --> 26:19.872
Yeah. I didn't know
he rents a house up here.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.038
Yeah, the last five years.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.240
He likes to pretend to fish.

26:24.950 --> 26:28.181
I think he has the editor of
The Book Review as a houseguest.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.880
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.287
So, I invited them for dinner
on Friday night.

26:32.357 --> 26:36.817
-Really?
-Along with a few other people.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.659
-Well, why not?
-Well...

26:39.731 --> 26:44.259
We never have anyone to the house.
It'll be fun.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.166
Please.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.797
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.377
Murderer!

29:19.858 --> 29:21.689
Murderer!

29:27.165 --> 29:28.757
Anna?

29:29.367 --> 29:31.164
What are you doing down here?

29:32.871 --> 29:35.305
Hey. Are you okay?

29:36.641 --> 29:38.074
It was Mom.

29:38.743 --> 29:41.109
-What?
-I saw Mom!

29:43.114 --> 29:44.411
What are you talking about?

29:44.482 --> 29:45.779
Anna?

29:48.186 --> 29:49.585
Anna!

29:50.955 --> 29:53.583
She's been trying to tell me something.

29:55.593 --> 29:59.689
-What?
-The fire wasn't an accident.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.426
It was her.

30:19.184 --> 30:22.051
Rachel just happened to
have the night off.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.645
Yeah, right.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.320
-Alex...
-No, it all makes sense now.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.454
She left Mom,
parked her car down the street,

30:32.530 --> 30:34.225
put on those little white shoes,

30:34.299 --> 30:37.132
and walked back down
to the boathouse.

30:37.202 --> 30:40.797
-Maybe we're jumping to conclusions.
-Excuse me,

30:40.872 --> 30:42.271
I'm not the one that
saw our dead mother

30:42.340 --> 30:45.332
point the finger
at Dad's creepy girlfriend.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.345
Yeah, I think it was just a dream.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.404
Anna, you were wide awake. I saw you.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.541
Well, maybe it was all in my head.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.051
Maybe so.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.644
But it doesn't change
what both of us know.

30:57.755 --> 31:01.555
That tap didn't leak. Rachel turned it on.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.891
She killed Mom,
and she's not gonna get away with it.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.089
Hello? Hello in there?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.198
-Did she hear us?
-I don't know.

31:10.268 --> 31:13.465
Listen, I'm going into town
to do some shopping for this party.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.130
Would you like to come?

31:15.206 --> 31:18.107
Have some retail therapy,
maybe grab lunch?

31:19.244 --> 31:23.112
I'm totally hung over
and I'm expecting a headache later.

31:23.848 --> 31:26.646
-But Anna wants to come.
-What? No.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.653
What about Matt?
You could see him, talk to him.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.212
I thought you said he came back
to the house that night.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.121
-How about it, Anna?
-Come on.

31:34.192 --> 31:38.458
You can go, and I can stay here
and dig through her stuff. Go on.

31:38.529 --> 31:41.225
-You know, we can do it another time.
-No.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.629
I'll be down in a minute.

31:44.869 --> 31:47.929
I'm just gonna find
something cute to wear.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.735
You little suck-up.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.308
Your dad hates it when I drive fast.

31:56.381 --> 32:00.010
-Our little secret, okay?
-Our little secret.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.119
What happened to my mom's car?

32:07.659 --> 32:08.887
Well, we discussed it,

32:08.960 --> 32:13.420
and we just felt like
the family needed something more fun.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.785
My one good piece of jewelry.

32:40.258 --> 32:41.691
Where'd you get it?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.959
Oh, there.
Someone gave them to me ages ago.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.993
A boyfriend?

32:51.069 --> 32:53.264
An old patient, actually.

32:53.338 --> 32:56.535
Really? Sounds like a nice job.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.036
I wiped old people's asses
for a living, Anna.

33:02.280 --> 33:06.376
And let me assure you, they were
not all beautiful like your mom.

33:07.251 --> 33:09.719
No, I mostly had to do things
that decrepit old ladies

33:09.787 --> 33:13.917
with lots of money were either too
ashamed or weak to do for themselves.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.563
Wanna know how I got through it?

33:23.601 --> 33:25.091
It's terrible,

33:29.941 --> 33:32.739
but no matter how condescending
they were,

33:33.644 --> 33:38.172
how badly they treated me,
how badly they smelled,

33:39.650 --> 33:43.017
I always told myself,

33:43.087 --> 33:47.080
"They'll be dead very, very soon."

33:51.829 --> 33:56.960
You know, Anna, we all have things
in our past that we're ashamed of.

34:00.371 --> 34:04.432
I think sometimes
it's best to just let it go.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.077
Anna?

34:17.088 --> 34:19.681
Anna, are you all right?

34:24.762 --> 34:27.856
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.232
We have some shopping to do, right?

34:38.576 --> 34:41.636
Beautiful marbling.
How long has it been aged?

34:41.712 --> 34:46.081
-We sell everything fresh.
-Never mind.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.717
-I'm gonna go grab the milk.
-Great, thanks.

35:12.577 --> 35:16.069
-Matt.
-Anna. Hey.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.209
What are you doing here?

35:19.283 --> 35:23.413
Listen, I think... I think I know what
you were trying to tell me yesterday.

35:23.488 --> 35:26.116
The fire wasn't an accident, was it?

35:26.190 --> 35:28.385
-What did you see?
-Matt?

35:28.459 --> 35:29.949
Those berries aren't getting any fresher.

35:30.027 --> 35:32.222
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm coming.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.100
-Will you help us, please?
-Yeah, okay. Just not here.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.032
Okay, then can we meet tonight?

35:38.102 --> 35:40.161
Matt!

35:40.238 --> 35:44.698
-Yeah. 1 1 :00. At the rock.
-Okay.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.777
-Couldn't find the milk?
-Yeah.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.281
-We should go.
-Okay.

35:52.350 --> 35:56.684
Oh, and, Matt, you won't need to
make deliveries to the house anymore.

35:56.787 --> 35:59.278
That's gonna be my job from now on.

36:20.044 --> 36:22.103
-Have fun?
-Oh, yeah.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.149
Been telling each other
all our secrets, right, Anna?

36:25.216 --> 36:27.480
Yeah. Thanks for lunch.

36:34.792 --> 36:37.955
-Was everything okay?
-I lost her for a little bit.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.192
I mean, I just hope
this wasn't all too soon.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.635
Alex?

36:56.814 --> 36:58.338
Alex?

37:04.922 --> 37:07.823
Jesus, you scared me.
I thought you were her.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.224
-Did you talk to Matt?
-Yeah, we're meeting him tonight.

37:10.294 --> 37:13.320
Cool. Look at this.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.665
God, when are they bringing
in the stripper pole?

37:16.734 --> 37:20.101
I know, she's like a crack whore
without the dignity.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.437
P.S., look at this.

37:26.010 --> 37:29.036
Come on. Look what I found.

37:30.648 --> 37:34.209
-Meet Mr. Chubby.
-Oh, that's disgusting.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.686
No, I'm not touching that.

37:52.370 --> 37:55.567
Okay, that's enough
to tranquilize a horse.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.130
Or you and me.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.241
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait.

38:07.418 --> 38:08.749
Party's over, Rach.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.362
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.529
Matt?

38:56.767 --> 38:58.029
Matt?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.969
This doesn't feel right.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.707
What if something's happened?

39:15.119 --> 39:18.054
It's okay, Anna.
We'll find him tomorrow.

39:18.656 --> 39:20.055
Yeah.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.385
I'm gonna go to bed.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.294
No, please stay with me till I fall asleep.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.760
If I had 10 bucks
for every time I heard that.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.166
Thank you.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.597
No funny stuff.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.501
Anna, hey. Hey, don't be afraid.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.268
I just didn't want to
wake your parents up.

40:11.342 --> 40:14.106
Matt. Where were you?

40:14.812 --> 40:16.871
We waited for you at the rock,
just like you said.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.006
Yeah, I know, l...

40:19.583 --> 40:22.108
What happened? You're soaked.

40:22.186 --> 40:25.246
You know, I fell and hurt my back
or something.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.620
Well, here, come sit down.

40:31.195 --> 40:35.632
I'm sorry it's so late, but... It's just...

40:37.902 --> 40:41.804
I think you need to know the truth
about what I saw that night.

40:43.507 --> 40:44.735
Tell me.

40:46.977 --> 40:48.410
You're shivering.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.309
I can't feel anything.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.852
-I'm scared, Anna.
-Don't be.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.467
Matt, what happened to your back?

41:25.683 --> 41:30.484
Your mother tried to warn me, Anna,
but I didn't listen.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.792
Hold me. Anna.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.097
Anna.

41:44.468 --> 41:49.770
Please, hold me. Anna, please.

43:18.662 --> 43:22.689
Anna? Hi, I'm Sheriff Emery.
I don't know if you remember me.

43:24.401 --> 43:27.393
Listen, we're gonna do
a thorough investigation,

43:27.471 --> 43:30.770
but he must have hit a patch of timber,

43:30.841 --> 43:33.469
fell out of the boat and broke his back.

43:37.014 --> 43:39.244
Were you supposed to meet him?

43:42.453 --> 43:46.150
Listen, we all know
what you're going through.

43:46.223 --> 43:50.353
Anything you need, anything at all,
you come see me.

43:50.427 --> 43:51.951
You understand?

43:53.263 --> 43:54.924
I'm deeply sorry.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.914
It's just terrible.

44:18.455 --> 44:21.481
I'm gonna make breakfast.
You should eat something.

44:21.558 --> 44:22.855
-Coffee?
-Yeah.

44:22.926 --> 44:25.326
-Dad, wait.
-What?

44:29.667 --> 44:33.034
Matt wasn't just in the water last night.
He was coming to see me.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.162
Anna, what happened to Matt
is not your fault.

44:35.239 --> 44:37.070
Dad, that's not what she's trying to say.

44:37.141 --> 44:39.109
One of you come help me.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.605
-Dad.
-I'll go.

44:46.650 --> 44:49.847
-What?
-I saw Matt in town yesterday.

44:51.388 --> 44:53.879
He told me he saw what happened
the night of the fire.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.288
Rachel overheard us.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.225
She didn't want me
to talk to him anymore.

44:59.263 --> 45:00.821
She didn't want him
to come here ever again.

45:00.898 --> 45:03.628
Anna, why would Rachel
say something like that?

45:03.701 --> 45:05.032
It's just...

45:06.770 --> 45:08.101
What?

45:09.306 --> 45:11.740
Is everything all right out there?

45:12.309 --> 45:14.709
-We'll be right in.
-Okay.

45:18.916 --> 45:23.785
Sweetheart, I know
this is difficult for you.

45:24.621 --> 45:29.320
It's been hard for all of us,
but, please, don't do this.

45:29.993 --> 45:32.393
Okay? Just don't do this.

45:33.864 --> 45:37.322
-Come on, have some breakfast.
-I'll be there in a minute.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.392
You okay?

46:11.135 --> 46:13.399
No, I'm not okay.

46:15.172 --> 46:17.003
I'm not crazy, Alex.

46:20.477 --> 46:25.039
Matt was here, and I thought
that I was dreaming, but I wasn't.

46:25.516 --> 46:27.006
-Anna, do you wanna sit...
-And he said

46:27.084 --> 46:28.745
that Mom was trying to warn him.

46:28.819 --> 46:30.548
-Okay, how can that be?
-And he was holding me.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.486
-Anna, listen.
-Look!

46:34.925 --> 46:36.654
Oh, my God.

46:42.166 --> 46:45.863
-Okay, now I'm afraid.
-I'm not crazy.

46:47.337 --> 46:48.702
They're not gonna send me back there.

46:48.772 --> 46:52.936
No, I'm not afraid for you.
I'm afraid for us.

46:53.777 --> 46:56.507
Anna, we're the last ones

46:56.613 --> 46:59.639
standing between Rachel
and what she really wants.

47:01.351 --> 47:02.716
Come on. Look,

47:02.786 --> 47:06.722
Iast time I checked, you didn't become
some psycho serial killer overnight,

47:06.790 --> 47:10.954
so we need to find out exactly
who Miss Rachel Summers really is.

47:25.576 --> 47:28.136
Yes, hi, I'm trying to
get some information

47:28.212 --> 47:31.010
about someone we hired
through your agency.

47:31.648 --> 47:34.640
Her name's Summers.
Rachel Summers.

47:35.919 --> 47:40.049
Hello, I'd like to get a reference
on one of your nurses, please.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.458
I believe she was on your staff
at the hospital

47:43.527 --> 47:47.019
between July and December of 2005.

47:48.999 --> 47:50.864
Hi, I'm running a background check

47:50.934 --> 47:54.028
on someone who worked for you
several years ago.

47:54.738 --> 47:59.641
Summers. S-U-M-M...
Yeah, as in "mother."

47:59.743 --> 48:02.303
E-R-S, as in "Satan."

48:04.281 --> 48:07.512
What? No, that's impossible.

48:11.188 --> 48:13.156
No, no, no, that's fine.

48:13.590 --> 48:15.683
Okay, thanks very much. Bye.

48:19.529 --> 48:21.019
We've got her.

48:28.972 --> 48:32.408
Anna. Come in.

48:36.813 --> 48:39.646
You know,
you have beautifully shaped lips.

48:40.951 --> 48:43.681
You just don't know
what to do with them.

48:44.488 --> 48:48.481
Men will go on about a woman's eyes,
but that's bullshit.

48:49.593 --> 48:56.362
What they really want is
a girl with a pretty mouth.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.463
There.

49:08.478 --> 49:10.912
You seem very interested in these.

49:12.316 --> 49:14.341
Would you like to wear them tonight?

49:15.686 --> 49:19.486
-No, I don't think so.
-Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.259
There.

49:27.364 --> 49:29.594
What's your real name, Rachel?

49:30.534 --> 49:32.297
What did you say?

49:33.704 --> 49:37.868
The State Nursing Association
has no record of a Rachel Summers.

49:37.941 --> 49:40.967
Your social security number's
for someone named Rachel Summers,

49:41.044 --> 49:44.070
but she's a school teacher
from New Orleans.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.138
She died five years ago.

49:48.885 --> 49:51.786
So, who are you, really?

50:00.097 --> 50:02.031
You know what, Anna?

50:04.201 --> 50:06.601
I don't think this is going to work out.

50:13.777 --> 50:16.109
Where do you think you're going?

50:17.447 --> 50:19.312
To talk to my father.

50:20.250 --> 50:22.650
Well, there's really no need.

50:22.719 --> 50:26.416
We've already discussed it
with Dr. Silberling.

50:28.625 --> 50:32.356
-Discussed what?
-Well, your behavior.

50:33.463 --> 50:36.125
Anna, he's very concerned.

50:36.199 --> 50:43.002
He's beginning to think that
it was a mistake letting you out.

50:44.641 --> 50:48.907
You won't take this away from me.
I won't allow it.

50:50.847 --> 50:53.281
Now, get out. I have guests coming.

51:01.691 --> 51:04.387
I can't believe she sold you out to Dad.

51:05.529 --> 51:09.295
Maybe she can threaten you,
but what can they do to me?

51:09.366 --> 51:11.527
-I'm gonna talk to Dad.
-No.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.293
All she's gonna do is convince him

51:13.370 --> 51:16.100
that we're lying
and that it's my fault, okay?

51:16.173 --> 51:18.903
We just have to get through tonight,
and then tomorrow we go to the police

51:18.975 --> 51:21.170
and tell them what's going on.

51:21.244 --> 51:23.678
You're only gonna make it worse for me.

51:26.149 --> 51:30.609
Fine. But this is gonna
take a lot of alcohol.

51:41.765 --> 51:44.290
Hey. Look at you.

51:44.835 --> 51:47.668
-What?
-You look terrific.

51:47.737 --> 51:49.170
Thanks.

51:49.873 --> 51:53.036
Well, I guess
you've grown up on me, haven't you?

51:53.877 --> 51:57.973
Hey, if it's any consolation,
this is all pretty weird for me, too.

51:58.081 --> 51:59.708
Book launch parties.

51:59.749 --> 52:01.114
Might as well give everyone
a green light

52:01.184 --> 52:03.914
to come into your house and judge you.

52:08.325 --> 52:12.352
Can I ask you a favor?
Would you give Rachel a hand tonight?

52:13.130 --> 52:16.896
The truth is, I don't think
she feels good enough for all of this,

52:16.967 --> 52:20.232
and people here are judging her, too.

52:22.772 --> 52:24.205
Sure.

52:33.884 --> 52:35.181
What?

52:36.086 --> 52:39.021
I just wanted to know
if you needed any help.

52:39.923 --> 52:41.117
Really?

52:42.726 --> 52:44.455
Sure. Open the oven.

52:49.199 --> 52:50.530
Okay.

52:53.303 --> 52:59.435
The key to a good roast is to
let it sit 1 0 minutes before carving.

52:59.876 --> 53:01.810
It lets the blood flow back in.

53:04.781 --> 53:06.510
Back to the fray.

53:07.584 --> 53:09.984
Take out the garbage, will you?

54:35.538 --> 54:37.165
You're next.

54:41.678 --> 54:46.945
No. No. What did you do?
What did you do?

54:48.084 --> 54:50.052
What are you trying to do to me?

54:50.120 --> 54:51.348
What happened?

54:56.593 --> 54:58.493
You leave her alone.

55:00.330 --> 55:02.025
Just go to bed.

55:12.375 --> 55:17.369
No, no. Listen, I'll be in New York
tomorrow and we can sort this all out.

55:17.447 --> 55:20.712
Sorry about this. Travel safe.

55:31.494 --> 55:34.827
Dad? Can I talk to you?

55:44.774 --> 55:47.709
Tonight. There's a reason for
what happened.

55:49.412 --> 55:51.243
It's Rachel.
She's not who you think she is.

55:51.314 --> 55:53.305
Enough, Anna.

55:53.383 --> 55:56.648
-What has she done this time?
-She's lied to you.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.284
-About what?
-About everything. About her name.

56:01.591 --> 56:02.717
Do you even know where she's from?

56:02.792 --> 56:03.952
I'm not gonna dignify that
with an answer.

56:04.027 --> 56:06.495
No, of course you're not, because
you only see what you wanna see.

56:06.563 --> 56:09.361
All she is trying to do
is make this family work.

56:09.432 --> 56:11.195
She's not trying to make it work.

56:11.267 --> 56:13.599
-She wants you for herself.
-That is ridiculous.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.467
God, if Mom could see you now,

56:15.538 --> 56:18.996
siding with that bitch
who's trying to tear us apart!

56:23.179 --> 56:26.080
Rachel isn't the one
who's tearing us apart.

56:28.451 --> 56:31.818
Look, maybe we should talk
to Dr. Silberling about this.

56:31.888 --> 56:33.583
Right, because I'm the one who's crazy.

56:33.656 --> 56:36.887
-I didn't say that. You know I did...
-Dad.

56:37.627 --> 56:39.891
You're not wearing your ring.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.666
Are you gonna marry her?

56:56.780 --> 56:59.840
-Tell me!
-Yes, Anna.

57:00.683 --> 57:03.481
We're getting married
sometime this fall.

57:08.124 --> 57:11.184
We talked about going away,
but I wanna have the wedding here,

57:11.261 --> 57:12.785
for all of us.

57:14.130 --> 57:18.430
I'm not ashamed, Anna.
I'm not ashamed to be happy again.

57:46.930 --> 57:48.295
Bye, Daddy.

57:53.470 --> 57:57.804
We shouldn't be late for Matt's service.
Wear something decent.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.901
I wanna look like a family.

58:06.249 --> 58:08.410
"ln the Lord, I take refuge.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.215
"How can you say to me,
'Flee like a bird to the mountains.

58:11.588 --> 58:15.046

58:18.428 --> 58:22.455
"'When foundations are being
destroyed, what can the upright do?'

58:22.765 --> 58:26.826
"The Lord is in his holy temple.
The Lord's throne is in heaven.

"God's eyes keep careful watch."

58:45.288 --> 58:49.384
"The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Whom do I fear?

58:50.126 --> 58:53.391
"The Lord is my life's refuge.
Of whom am I afraid?

This is from April 1 1, 1 996.

"Police have recovered the bodies
of three children

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:56.911
-Mildred Kemp?
-Holy shit. Listen to this.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.783
"According to sources
close to the family,

Look. Look what she's wearing.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.335
The pearls.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:22.708
Rachel said they were a gift
from an old patient.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:26.977
She put them around my neck.
Like... Like she was proud of them.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:31.351
Yeah, well, lucky for us,
now we have proof.

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:35.281
Yeah, if we can get our hands on them.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.990
Don't worry about that.
This ends tonight.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.122
Shit.

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.767
Hey, look.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:36.416
-Alex, where are you going?
-Just go downstairs and get her keys.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.717
-What are you gonna do?
-Just get her keys.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.223
What are you looking for, Anna?

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:52.789
Is it these? Are you looking for these?

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.928
You should take them.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.199
Please. They mean nothing to me.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.039
We know, Rachel.

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.733
We know everything.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.540
You caught me.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.110
Here.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.390
Alex!

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:27.356
Alex!

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.549
Anna.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.220
I don't want to hurt you.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:03.231
This isn't how I wanted it.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.701
You can make this easy.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.072
-Anna.
-Alex.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:26.416
-What happened?
-She drugged me. She drugged me.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.150
Anna? Open the door.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.658
Anna, listen to me.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:34.457
-You have to get that necklace.
-I did. I got it.

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:37.525
Anna! Open this goddamn door!

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.906
You gotta go to Emery, okay?

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.807
-No. No.
-Yes. He'll believe you.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:50.072
-Anna!
-I can't leave you here.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.345
Pinkie pact.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.244
Anna!

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:58.549
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.050
I love you.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:15.402
I'll come back for you, okay? I promise.

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.025
Anna!

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.249
So, you're alleging that
Miss Summers is actually a woman

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.807
-named Mildred Kemp?
-Yes.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:05.581
And she was the one responsible
for the fire?

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.281
That's right. It wasn't an accident.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:10.519
She murdered our mother,
and now she's after us.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:17.089
-Listen, I know how this sounds, but...
-No. Mildred Kemp. I remember her.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:22.262
Out west in Woolridge County,
years ago, wife died,

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:25.102
man hired some nanny
who killed all the children.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.335
That's right, but they never caught her.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:31.904
Okay, listen, Mrs. Wright
had a pearl necklace, three strands.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:34.415
There are pictures of it
on the lnternet if you wanna see.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.973
And?

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.087
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.787
Okay? She's trying to kill us
and marry our father,

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.886
just like she did to them.

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:55.731
Listen, I want you to sit tight.

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.932
Jerry is right outside that door.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.905
I'm gonna pull up Miss Summers
on the system.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:02.740
No, there's no time for that.
You have to go to my house.

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:07.146
Alex is still there, and I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to her.

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:10.811
Nothing's gonna happen
to anybody, Anna. You wait here.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.292
Mom?

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.402
Mom?

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.381
Don't be afraid. I'm a nurse.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:19.581
No! No! Don't believe her! No! No!
Please! Don't believe her!

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:22.647
No! She's lying!
Don't believe her, please!

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:28.185
No! No! Don't believe her! No! She...

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.366
There we go. Thank you.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.522
I remember her.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:02.997
It was out west in Woolridge County,
years ago, wife died,

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:05.898
man hired some nanny
who killed all the children.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.993
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:12.268
"Police have issued a warrant

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:34.288
You' re gonna sleep now.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:50.635
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.144
I can't.

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:58.109
Did I ever tell you that?

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:06.686
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.331
But now you've taken that
away from me.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.524
Careful.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.597
You don't want to hurt yourself.

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.132
Anna?

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:09.407
We tried everything, Anna.
This was the only way.

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:13.871
What did you do?

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.949
What did you do?

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.012
I had to, Anna. Didn't l?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.752
Didn't I have to?

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:34.159
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm always here.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.670
Look at me. Look at me.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:45.079
Be brave, okay? Okay.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.552
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:54.350
It's Rachel, Dad. Rachel started the fire.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:58.283
-What are you talking about?
-She killed Mom.

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:02.227
Dad, I know you never listen to me,
but you have to believe us!

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:04.061
She waited until you were out of town,

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.930
and she drugged me,
and she drugged Alex.

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:10.531
-What?
-She was gonna kill us.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.800
Alex had to do it, Dad. She saved us.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:17.708
-Alex?
-Alex, tell him.

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.247
Anna, what are you saying?

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:23.845
He can't see it, Anna. He never will.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.779
Anna, you know what happened
to your sister.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.948
-Tell him, Alex.
-Don't believe him.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.151
-She died.
-No, don't believe him.

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.625
In the fire.

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:35.492
-lt was a year ago.
-No! He's lying!

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.691
Alex is dead!

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.435
What have you done?

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.083
Alex?

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.656
Anna?

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.827
Anna, what do you mean
the fire wasn't an accident?

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:18.805
What happened that night?
Tell me what happened that night!

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:23.671
Get away from me. Get away from me.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.770
Get away from me!

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:43.897
Hello? Dad?

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:47.823
The guys, they want to
come back to our house.

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.562
It's not our house anymore.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.433
What are you doing?

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.300
They can burn in hell.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.669
Anna. Anna!

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.679
Anna, what's wrong?

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:12.716
-Alex?
-Coming, Mom.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:24.927
Alex!

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.152
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.059
Those were my letters, Dad.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.725
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell
her about your new little girlfriend?

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.634
Was that it?
Talk about all the dirty little secrets?

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.233
Anna?

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:09.436
Listen, I'm going into town.
You wanna come?

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.970
I followed you home that night, Anna.

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.243
I saw everything.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:17.512
Don't let go. Anna, hold me.

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:28.185
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.091
I can't.

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:35.799
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.968
But now you've taken that
away from me.

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.355
I'm sorry, Mr. Ivers.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:06.026
I noticed the name
on Miss Summer's passport

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.229
doesn't match the name
on her driver's license.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:13.764
She changed her name three years ago.
Had a boyfriend used to beat her up.

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:19.272
Her real name is Rachel Worshinsky.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.450
Your daughter got it
in her mind somehow

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:27.386
that your fiancee
was a woman named Mildred Kemp.

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.126
Why would she make all this up?

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:28.748
Hello, Anna.

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.710
Are you okay?

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.724
I did exactly what you asked.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.084
Did what, Anna?

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.960
I finished what I started.

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.131
Welcome home.
