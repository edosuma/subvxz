00:34.664 --> 00:36.465
It's Thanksgiving, Klaus.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.868
You know what that means.

00:40.504 --> 00:43.539
A whole day of watching football
in my underwear,

00:43.573 --> 00:46.742
ending with my Redskins
destroying the Cowboys.

00:46.776 --> 00:49.945
Well done, sir.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.747
Won him at a school auction.

00:51.781 --> 00:53.082
What are you waiting for, Stan?

00:53.116 --> 00:55.751
We've only got four hours
of pre-game left.

00:55.785 --> 00:58.287
(gasps)
I'll go make the nachos.

00:58.321 --> 01:00.756
Hurry! They're waking up
Jimmy Johnson!

01:00.790 --> 01:02.224
Jimmy...

01:02.259 --> 01:05.093
Jimmy...

01:06.129 --> 01:08.164
Stan, put your pants on.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.565
No can do, Francine.

01:09.599 --> 01:11.233
This is the first
Thanksgiving in years

01:11.268 --> 01:13.302
where we won't be
entertaining any guests.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.171
I won't have to
put on any airs,

01:15.205 --> 01:17.239
and I certainly won't
be putting on my pants.

01:17.274 --> 01:19.108
But we are entertaining.

01:19.142 --> 01:20.776
My parents will
be here any minute.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.378
Your parents are coming?
(groans)

01:22.412 --> 01:24.113
We talked about this.

01:24.147 --> 01:29.151
Stan, I'm gonna invite
my parents for Thanksgiving.

01:29.186 --> 01:32.121
But then I thought about it
and the next day I told you...

01:32.155 --> 01:34.590
You know what, Francine?
Your parents at Thanksgiving,

01:34.624 --> 01:36.859
that's not gonna work for me.

01:36.893 --> 01:39.261
Oh, and, Steve, you'll have to
find someone else to pick you up

01:39.296 --> 01:40.963
after your eye surgery today.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.968
(door slides open)
It's about time, Dad.

01:46.002 --> 01:49.471
Hey, can we stop for pizza?
(door slides shut)

01:49.506 --> 01:52.007
Stan, it is a family holiday,
after all.

01:52.042 --> 01:54.677
That's right. <i>Our</i> family.
Not your parents.

01:54.711 --> 01:57.012
It's bad enough you and
the kids have to be here.

01:57.047 --> 01:58.747
Well, I'm sorry, Stan.

01:58.782 --> 02:00.583
But growing up
in a Chinese household,

02:00.617 --> 02:02.418
we never had Thanksgiving.

02:02.452 --> 02:04.220
I wanted to introduce 'em to it.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.189
Francine, I'm not running
a master class in Thanksgiving.

02:07.224 --> 02:10.626
Well, I invited 'em and
they're coming and that's that.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.696
Okay, but they eat alone in
the garage, out of trash bags,

02:13.730 --> 02:15.297
and use the neighbor's bathroom.

02:15.332 --> 02:16.799
Can we at least agree to that?

02:16.833 --> 02:19.935
No!
How about they have full yard privileges,

02:19.970 --> 02:22.071
two unrefrigerated sodas apiece,

02:22.105 --> 02:24.406
and at the end of the night
I'll say a chilly good-bye

02:24.441 --> 02:25.681
to the parent of your choosing?

02:25.709 --> 02:26.875
Do we have a deal?

02:28.345 --> 02:30.112
I'll ask you again in the car.

02:30.146 --> 02:32.147
You stay here.

02:35.752 --> 02:38.654
ANNOUNCER: If you're just tuning in
now, things are really heating up!

02:38.688 --> 02:40.990
Both teams have almost
completely checked out

02:41.024 --> 02:42.791
of their hotels.
ANNOUNCER #2: That's right.

02:42.826 --> 02:44.927
And with three hours
until the coin toss

02:44.961 --> 02:48.464
it is still anybody's game!

02:48.498 --> 02:49.932
What's wrong, man?

02:49.966 --> 02:51.600
Francine's parents are coming.

02:51.635 --> 02:53.916
They're totally gonna ruin
the Thanksgiving I had planned.

02:53.937 --> 02:54.903
(doorbell rings)

02:54.938 --> 02:56.238
They're here.

02:56.273 --> 02:57.573
Aw, this is gonna suck.

02:57.607 --> 03:00.109
I got it!

03:00.143 --> 03:03.245
(speaking Chinese gibberish)

03:03.280 --> 03:06.649
Ah, your Chinese gibberish
very mediocre.

03:06.683 --> 03:09.451
Either really learn language
or go broader.

03:09.486 --> 03:11.954
Just so you know, there's gonna
be football on today.

03:11.988 --> 03:13.455
I don't expect you
to understand.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.690
It's an American thing.

03:14.724 --> 03:17.359
U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!

03:17.394 --> 03:19.628
Come on, buddy, you got to join
me or I look like a total jerk.

03:19.663 --> 03:21.730
U-S-A! U-S-A!

03:21.765 --> 03:23.332
Man, I-I want to,

03:23.366 --> 03:25.968
but I don't know the words.

03:28.672 --> 03:30.239
Hello, Granddaughter.

03:30.273 --> 03:31.807
We share room tonight.

03:31.841 --> 03:34.143
Aw, you look sad.
What's wrong?

03:34.177 --> 03:35.978
Greasy face got you down?

03:36.012 --> 03:38.981
No, I-I'm sad because this
is the first Thanksgiving

03:39.015 --> 03:40.382
I've spent without Jeff.

03:40.417 --> 03:43.886
Let me tell you what my mom
tell me when I was your age:

03:43.920 --> 03:47.790
"Man you love die in space
so you marry Bah Bah now."

03:47.824 --> 03:49.458
We need find you new man.

03:49.492 --> 03:52.494
Thanks, Mah Mah,
but I'm just not over Jeff.

03:52.529 --> 03:55.230
That's because you still
surrounded by him.

03:55.265 --> 03:56.832
Reminders everywhere.

03:56.866 --> 03:58.901
You need to get rid
of his stuff.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:09.079 --> 04:10.346
Hey, that was mine!

04:10.380 --> 04:12.181
Sorry. Here.

04:12.215 --> 04:14.583
Use my pipe till I replace.

04:14.617 --> 04:19.021
It work good,
make you cough a lot.

04:19.055 --> 04:21.523
(Chinese folk music playing)

04:22.859 --> 04:25.027
Francine, what the hell's
goin' on in here?

04:25.061 --> 04:26.895
It should smell like turkey
and stuffing,

04:26.930 --> 04:29.631
not a medley of
longevity-inducing vegetables.

04:29.666 --> 04:32.968
Stan, this is my
mom's famous stir-fry.

04:33.002 --> 04:35.637
I thought we could have it
instead of sweet potatoes.

04:35.672 --> 04:37.473
But that's not Thanksgiving!

04:37.507 --> 04:39.274
I don't want
to see this tiny corn!

04:39.309 --> 04:41.043
I don't want to see
your tiny corn!

04:41.077 --> 04:42.544
Put on some pants!

04:42.579 --> 04:46.014
I'm not changing the way I dress
on this most American of days.

04:46.049 --> 04:48.884
This is traditional
American Thanksgiving garb.

04:48.918 --> 04:51.053
You know how you guys always
wear karate outfits?

04:51.087 --> 04:53.021
Well, this is Uncle Sam's
version of that.

04:53.056 --> 04:55.557
Stan, just go watch
some football.

04:55.592 --> 04:57.292
I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

04:57.327 --> 05:00.329
KLAUS: Stan, quick! They're
bringing out the turducken!

05:00.363 --> 05:02.664
ANNOUNCER #2: This year FOX
has genetically engineered

05:02.699 --> 05:04.800
an actual living turducken.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.735
(screeching)
Those are its screams.

05:06.770 --> 05:10.038
Its every step is agony.

05:10.073 --> 05:10.873
What the hell?

05:10.907 --> 05:12.975
I try to make picture better.

05:13.009 --> 05:14.209
No, please, God, no.

05:16.012 --> 05:19.348
Aiya, picture better before.

05:19.382 --> 05:20.349
(screams)

05:20.383 --> 05:21.617
Stan, what's wrong?!

05:21.651 --> 05:23.419
Your dad broke the TV!

05:23.453 --> 05:24.887
My holiday is ruined!

05:24.921 --> 05:27.489
Steve! Your Thanksgiving
marionettes!

05:27.524 --> 05:29.491
This is the perfect time
for them!

05:29.526 --> 05:30.893
(Steve screams)

05:30.927 --> 05:33.162
I just got to untangle them
and I'll be right down!

05:33.196 --> 05:35.030
Disaster averted.

05:35.064 --> 05:36.532
Francine, how long
have we been married

05:36.566 --> 05:38.267
without me raising
a hand to you?

05:38.301 --> 05:40.669
Look, if you want
your television fixed,

05:40.703 --> 05:42.271
call the Nerd Squad.

05:42.305 --> 05:44.440
Yes! A squad of nerds!

05:44.474 --> 05:46.408
They'll know what to do!
What's the number?

05:46.443 --> 05:48.811
I'll call them,
but in the meantime,

05:48.845 --> 05:52.414
can you at least make an effort
to get along with my family?

05:52.449 --> 05:55.451
(sighs) I'll try.

05:57.987 --> 05:59.888
As long as her parents
are in this house,

05:59.923 --> 06:01.890
I can't enjoy the Thanksgiving
I deserve.

06:01.925 --> 06:03.559
We have to get rid of them.

06:03.593 --> 06:05.627
Oh, my God.

06:05.662 --> 06:08.764
Are you suggesting an
organized and systematic...

06:08.798 --> 06:09.965
No.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.881
All right, Klaus,
we're the Pilgrims

06:14.915 --> 06:16.883
and Francine's parents
are the Indians.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.618
If we want to save
this Thanksgiving,

06:18.652 --> 06:20.487
we've got to get them
out of this house.

06:20.521 --> 06:22.155
Okay, first, you're calling
yourself a Pilgrim,

06:22.189 --> 06:23.389
but you're dressed
like an Indian.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.758
It's very confusing.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.761
Second, didn't the Pilgrims
invite the Indians to dinner?

06:27.795 --> 06:29.295
Klaus, you're missing the point.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.964
It might not have even happened.

06:30.998 --> 06:33.967
It's just a story that teaches
us to treat each other nicely.

06:34.001 --> 06:36.336
Now, we got to get these
stupid idiots out of our house!

06:36.370 --> 06:38.772
I see. And how do you plan
to do that?

06:38.806 --> 06:40.840
Why, exploit their fears,
of course.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.443
And throughout time,
what has consistently been

06:43.477 --> 06:45.512
the Chinese people's
greatest enemy?

06:46.547 --> 06:49.549
Roar!

06:52.119 --> 06:54.120
(screaming)

06:58.159 --> 07:00.426
Godzilla Japanese.

07:03.063 --> 07:04.864
(howling)

07:04.899 --> 07:07.367
I'm the ghost of Genghis Khan!

07:07.401 --> 07:09.769
I just got through
your Great Wall,

07:09.804 --> 07:12.572
and I'm going to
plunder your culture!

07:12.606 --> 07:18.111
Actually, not all Chinese people
think of Genghis Khan as scary.

07:18.145 --> 07:20.647
Many Chinese view him
as great military leader

07:20.681 --> 07:23.616
who laid down groundwork
for the third new dynasty.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.653
Francine, I bought a horse.

07:28.455 --> 07:30.456
(door opens)

07:32.393 --> 07:34.427
Ferocious panda on the loose!

07:34.461 --> 07:36.529
Run! Run
for your lives!

07:38.799 --> 07:40.567
It's got a gun!

07:42.636 --> 07:45.205
Huh. I don't know why you guys
are terrified of these things.

07:45.239 --> 07:46.806
We're not.
We love them.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.209
I knew it was one of the two.

07:49.243 --> 07:51.444
Francine, I bought a panda.

07:53.981 --> 07:55.515
Stupid Bah Bah.

07:55.549 --> 07:57.917
Ruining my Thanksgiving day
football.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.319
(grunts) Now?

07:59.353 --> 08:00.753
Do you see anything now?

08:00.788 --> 08:01.955
No, keep trying.

08:01.989 --> 08:04.490
Stan, I'm completely immersed
in water.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.160
Maybe I am not the one
to be futzing with the TV.

08:07.194 --> 08:09.229
Oh, don't be such a baby.

08:09.263 --> 08:11.097
(yelps)

08:11.131 --> 08:12.632
Ooh, ooh!
You almost had it!

08:12.666 --> 08:13.900
Wh-Whatever you did,
do it again!

08:13.934 --> 08:15.168
(doorbell rings)

08:15.202 --> 08:17.170
Nerd Squad.
I'm Trevor.

08:17.204 --> 08:18.972
Your wife called,
your TV's out.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.373
Oh, Roger, awesome!

08:20.407 --> 08:21.908
I said it's Trevor.

08:21.942 --> 08:23.443
Wait, do you really know
what you're doing

08:23.477 --> 08:24.711
or is this just a disguise?

08:24.745 --> 08:26.246
Sir, I have a family, too,

08:26.280 --> 08:27.981
that I would like to
spend Thanksgiving with,

08:28.015 --> 08:29.983
so if you can just
show me your TV.

08:30.017 --> 08:31.484
It's right here.

08:31.518 --> 08:34.988
Oh, wow, it usually takes me
a half hour to find those.

08:37.658 --> 08:38.758
Perfect, Stan!

08:38.792 --> 08:40.360
If Roger fixes the TV,

08:40.394 --> 08:42.895
then maybe Francine's parents
can stay after all.

08:42.929 --> 08:46.232
MAH MAH: Francine, where do you
recycle your chicken heads?

08:46.267 --> 08:49.235
No. No, if I don't put
a stop to this now,

08:49.270 --> 08:51.004
they're just gonna
come back every year.

08:52.072 --> 08:54.574
Oh, I just realized
this thing is tubeless.

08:54.608 --> 08:56.309
That might be a problem.

08:56.343 --> 08:57.577
Jeremy, it's Trev.

08:57.611 --> 08:59.512
We're gonna have
to open up a new ticket.

08:59.546 --> 09:01.314
Stan, why you pay good money?

09:01.348 --> 09:02.382
I could fix.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.717
You don't need to call
Nerd Brigade.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.853
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to step in here.

09:06.887 --> 09:09.522
I am from the Nerd <i>Squad,</i> okay?

09:09.556 --> 09:13.192
The Nerd Brigade wishes
they were the Nerd Squad.

09:13.227 --> 09:15.695
Trust me, all right?
Trust me on that.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.631
Ask anyone who does audiovisual
in the Langley Falls area

09:18.666 --> 09:21.034
and they will tell you
that they prefer the Nerd Squad

09:21.068 --> 09:23.436
all... day... long.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.104
Okay? Y-You want me to wait?

09:25.139 --> 09:27.740
You want me to wait here for you
while you ask anyone in town?

09:27.775 --> 09:28.942
'Cause I'll be here.

09:28.976 --> 09:31.778
I'll be right here
fixing your TV right.

09:31.812 --> 09:34.781
The first time. On Thanksgiving.

09:34.815 --> 09:37.050
You know
what I'm thankful for? Huh?

09:37.084 --> 09:39.585
I am thankful that I work
for the best damn

09:39.620 --> 09:41.921
home theater installation
company in town.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.190
The Nerd Squad!

09:44.224 --> 09:47.060
Oh, that's right.
I work for the other one.

09:47.094 --> 09:49.595
Jeremy, we're gonna have
to give a customer a free cable.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.732
Um, put it under Code 60,
Customer Satisfaction.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.734
I'll just give him
a three-foot HDMI.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.669
It'll only go from the receiver
to the TV.

09:56.704 --> 09:58.571
He can't use it
for anything else.

09:59.940 --> 10:02.442
(sighs)

10:02.476 --> 10:04.510
This was his greatest invention,

10:04.545 --> 10:06.846
a snowboard with wheels on it.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.315
For sidewalks.

10:09.350 --> 10:10.984
Hi-ya.

10:11.018 --> 10:13.252
Okay, you got rid
of Jeff's stuff.

10:13.287 --> 10:14.387
First step done.

10:14.421 --> 10:16.923
Next step, get you new man.

10:16.957 --> 10:20.259
I appreciate that, Mah Mah,
but it's just not that easy.

10:20.294 --> 10:22.061
Oh, it not easy?

10:22.096 --> 10:23.396
'Cause it already done.

10:23.430 --> 10:24.664
Big Wang Bai!

10:24.698 --> 10:26.165
Uh, what?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.567
Big Wang Bai!

10:27.601 --> 10:28.901
He your new boyfriend.

10:28.936 --> 10:30.903
His grandma and I frenemies.

10:30.938 --> 10:33.439
He big success.
Wear clothes by Ralph Lauren.

10:33.474 --> 10:34.907
Okay...

10:34.942 --> 10:36.442
You need more? Fine!

10:36.477 --> 10:37.744
I show you.

10:37.778 --> 10:39.045
See? Look.

10:39.079 --> 10:42.148
Big Wang ride Segway
in downtown Long Beach.

10:42.182 --> 10:45.651
Big Wang never let
his Groupons expire.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.920
He pose on Ferrari!

10:47.955 --> 10:50.823
Hey, Ferraris.
Those cost money.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.425
Shh! You missing Big Wang

10:52.459 --> 10:53.893
wearing white button-down
and jeans

10:53.927 --> 10:55.628
and taking picture
with friends.

10:55.662 --> 10:58.464
Then, he goes to party
and wear all white,

10:58.499 --> 11:01.200
even string
in puka shell necklace <i>white!</i>

11:01.235 --> 11:03.536
He bad boy for life.

11:03.570 --> 11:07.306
Oh, he order extra large
Blizzard at Dairy Queen

11:07.341 --> 11:08.975
and <i>finish!</i>

11:09.009 --> 11:12.545
Mmm. Where are you
puttin' it, Big Wang?

11:12.579 --> 11:14.180
<i>Wait. What am I thinking?</i>

11:14.214 --> 11:16.482
<i>Big Wang Bai too good</i>
<i>for Hayley.</i>

11:16.517 --> 11:19.385
<i>But not too good for Mah Mah.</i>

11:19.420 --> 11:21.687
I guess it wouldn't
hurt to contact him.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.923
No, no, no.
No, he no right for you.

11:23.957 --> 11:25.425
But I thought...
He taken!

11:25.459 --> 11:27.193
But it says here he's single.

11:27.227 --> 11:28.361
(gong bangs)

11:28.395 --> 11:29.729
What was that for?

11:29.763 --> 11:32.031
Haven't you ever seen
<i>The Gong Show?</i>

11:32.066 --> 11:34.200
You lose! Get out!

11:34.234 --> 11:35.768
But it's my room.

11:35.803 --> 11:37.804
(banging gong)

11:42.342 --> 11:43.643
Yeah, you're all set.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.144
You got all your channels now,

11:45.179 --> 11:48.081
although, unfortunately,
because of a licensing dispute,

11:48.115 --> 11:52.552
you currently don't get
A&E, TBS, FX, AMC or ESPN.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.388
But you do get our
satellite radio package,

11:55.422 --> 11:58.357
featuring <i>Reggae Sunsets</i>
on channel 12 hundred.

11:58.392 --> 12:00.159
Great! I can't
thank you enough.

12:00.194 --> 12:01.794
Oh, well, if you feel that way,

12:01.829 --> 12:03.696
and you get a call
from my company

12:03.730 --> 12:05.231
about completing a survey
about the service,

12:05.265 --> 12:07.700
it'd be a big help to me
if you mentioned my name.

12:07.734 --> 12:08.835
Oh, yeah, definitely.

12:08.869 --> 12:10.369
Thank you so much.

12:10.404 --> 12:11.671
What's my name?

12:11.705 --> 12:14.107
Rrr... uh, Rizz...

12:14.141 --> 12:16.142
Rizzoli?

12:16.176 --> 12:18.111
Rizzoli and Isles?

12:18.145 --> 12:20.346
I associate Rizzoli and Isles
with cable.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.714
Are you one of them?

12:21.748 --> 12:24.217
Just for that, I'm giving
you Starz and Encore.

12:24.251 --> 12:26.285
Have fun flippin' past 'em.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.487
(door opens and closes)

12:27.521 --> 12:28.721
(sighs, indistinct voices on TV)

12:28.755 --> 12:30.923
Look at that, Stan.
The TV's fixed.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.126
This Thanksgiving
might be salvaged yet.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.561
I told you. It's no longer
about the TV.

12:35.596 --> 12:38.698
We've got to flush these
Chinese Indians off our land.

12:38.732 --> 12:40.700
FRANCINE:
Stan, honey, dinner.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.571
(Stan coughing)

12:45.606 --> 12:48.508
Oh. Oh, gang, bad news.

12:48.542 --> 12:51.844
Bad news, especially
for anyone old and Chinese.

12:51.879 --> 12:53.880
I just got back
from the doctor,

12:53.914 --> 12:56.782
and the results show
I'm positive for Bird Flu.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.752
This just receipt from Arby's.

12:59.786 --> 13:01.787
How you eat ten
beef and cheddars?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.422
They were sliders!

13:03.457 --> 13:04.891
Hey, that's my chair!

13:04.925 --> 13:06.993
I am guest,
which makes it my chair.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.461
Stan, just sit somewhere else.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.996
But that's my chair!

13:10.030 --> 13:12.064
Don't be such a baby!

13:12.099 --> 13:14.066
And take the trash out
before we eat.

13:14.101 --> 13:15.768
It's stinking up the house.

13:19.373 --> 13:22.742
'Sup? I'm Big Wang Bai.

13:22.776 --> 13:25.044
This the... Smith house?

13:25.078 --> 13:27.013
They're all inside.

13:27.047 --> 13:29.582
Big Wang Bai?

13:29.616 --> 13:31.584
What are you doing here?

13:31.618 --> 13:32.919
Who invite you?

13:32.953 --> 13:34.253
I did, Mah Mah.

13:34.288 --> 13:36.289
You whore!

13:37.591 --> 13:40.593
Big Wang, have you met
my <i>grandmother,</i> Mah Mah?

13:40.627 --> 13:41.961
No, I haven't.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.163
Hello. I'm Big Wang Bai.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.165
My mother's told me
all about you.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.868
(Mah Mah moaning)

13:48.902 --> 13:50.937
I-I'm sorry.

13:50.971 --> 13:52.939
I no want to meet this way.

13:52.973 --> 13:56.809
I must put on face cream
and holiday wig.

13:56.843 --> 13:58.811
You want me
to take out the trash?

13:58.845 --> 14:00.980
I'll take out the Mah Mah
and Bah Bah.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.315
'Cause they're trash.

14:02.349 --> 14:04.050
They're the ones
stinking up the house.

14:04.084 --> 14:05.251
'Cause they're stinkers.

14:05.285 --> 14:06.752
They're a couple of stinkers.

14:06.787 --> 14:09.655
Aah! Why don't I ever think
of these things in the moment?

14:09.690 --> 14:10.957
Hey!

14:10.991 --> 14:13.492
They threw out
my Redskins headdress!

14:20.567 --> 14:21.901
Look at them.

14:21.935 --> 14:25.071
They've taken over my home.

14:25.105 --> 14:26.939
Oh, my God.

14:26.974 --> 14:28.574
I'm not the pilgrim.

14:28.609 --> 14:31.244
I'm the Indian,
and I've lost my home.

14:31.278 --> 14:33.346
I belong nowhere.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.482
I guess I walk the land now.

14:36.516 --> 14:38.050
(whistles)

14:38.085 --> 14:39.252
Here, Dixie Cup!

14:39.286 --> 14:42.221
(tires squeak)

14:43.357 --> 14:44.590
(engine revving)

14:44.625 --> 14:46.626
Easy, girl. Easy.

14:49.162 --> 14:51.163
(thudding, tires squeaking)

14:52.866 --> 14:54.867
(tires squealing)

14:58.203 --> 15:00.037
I've been displaced.

15:00.072 --> 15:02.707
I must wander, seeking a land
where I might belong.

15:02.741 --> 15:05.376
At least I have the radio
to keep me company.

15:05.410 --> 15:08.713
MAN (on radio): Coming up next,
20 minutes of reflective silence.

15:08.747 --> 15:11.015
Perfect.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.418
(brakes squeak)

15:17.222 --> 15:19.557
You ever eat here before?

15:19.591 --> 15:20.958
Every year.

15:20.992 --> 15:22.159
Must be good.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.694
Excuse me, you can't eat here.

15:23.729 --> 15:24.895
You're not homeless.

15:24.930 --> 15:26.063
How'd you know?

15:26.098 --> 15:27.398
You're wearing a wedding ring,

15:27.432 --> 15:29.400
which means
you haven't sold it for drugs.

15:29.434 --> 15:30.801
Your eyebrows
are well-groomed,

15:30.836 --> 15:32.670
suggesting a recent visit
to the salon.

15:32.704 --> 15:34.805
And while I smell beer
on your breath,

15:34.840 --> 15:37.441
it has a whiff of the...
Dutch lowlands,

15:37.476 --> 15:38.976
which means it's imported.

15:39.010 --> 15:41.045
And only homeownersdrink import.

15:44.116 --> 15:47.218
Shirley, you got to
come back to the force.

15:47.252 --> 15:49.620
You were the best detective
this city ever had.

15:49.654 --> 15:52.089
Sorry, I feel like
I make a bigger difference

15:52.124 --> 15:54.625
recognizing who's not homeless.

15:58.764 --> 16:02.199
The stadium.
Packed with Redskins fans.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.468
I may have just found my people.

16:06.104 --> 16:08.739
(cheering)

16:08.774 --> 16:10.508
(two beeps)

16:10.542 --> 16:11.709
Ticket, please.

16:11.743 --> 16:13.677
Oh, I don't have one,
but trust me,

16:13.712 --> 16:14.845
I need to be in there.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.046
It's where I belong.

16:16.081 --> 16:17.381
So, you don't have a ticket?

16:17.416 --> 16:18.616
No, but I'm a Redskins fan.

16:18.650 --> 16:19.917
I've been here
since the beginning.

16:19.951 --> 16:22.119
Oh. Okay, well here's
how the system works.

16:22.154 --> 16:23.454
You need a ticket.

16:23.488 --> 16:25.723
Oh, I-I have one right here!

16:25.757 --> 16:27.458
Sir, that's a
receipt from Arby's,

16:27.492 --> 16:30.261
and I'm not gonna touch it,
because, from what I can tell,

16:30.295 --> 16:32.430
its been in your underpants.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.400
(cheering)

16:39.571 --> 16:41.505
(with Southern accent):
Hey, man, Redskins suck!

16:41.540 --> 16:43.274
I just want to pass!

16:43.308 --> 16:45.476
I seek no fight,
nor do I offer it!

16:45.510 --> 16:47.378
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy now, partner.

16:47.412 --> 16:48.746
You didn't let me finish.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.614
I was gonna say
that Redskins suck,

16:50.649 --> 16:54.151
but Redskins <i>fans</i> are just fine
in my book,

16:54.186 --> 16:56.187
and welcome
to partake of our bounty.

16:56.221 --> 16:57.922
(with Southern accent):
I'm always tellin' him

16:57.956 --> 16:59.557
to structure
his sentences better.

16:59.591 --> 17:00.925
I'm Laura.
This is Marvin.

17:00.959 --> 17:02.760
You up for a tailgate, hon?

17:02.794 --> 17:05.930
Thanks, but winter is upon me,
and I'm close to death.

17:05.964 --> 17:07.531
I need to get somewhere warm.

17:07.566 --> 17:09.666
Well, hell, there's plenty
of warmth right here.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.435
Tonight's foam finger night,

17:11.470 --> 17:13.503
and these East Coast
folks love to litter.

17:13.538 --> 17:15.772
Let me show you
a little cowboy trick.

17:15.807 --> 17:17.508
(sighs)

17:17.541 --> 17:20.678
I feel like I'm nestled
in the womb of a Nerf lady.

17:20.712 --> 17:22.579
Oh, yeah, pretty warm, right?

17:22.614 --> 17:24.615
Now how about a nice,
cold beer?

17:25.717 --> 17:27.451
Now, hold on there, chief.

17:27.486 --> 17:28.853
Those ain't free.

17:28.887 --> 17:30.721
I'm sorry. I don't
have any money.

17:30.755 --> 17:33.057
Well, that's good,
'cause we only accept these.

17:33.091 --> 17:34.992
Up high!

17:35.026 --> 17:37.361
Now you're talkin', Geronimo!

17:37.395 --> 17:40.498
Let's sit down and talk ash
about each other's teams.

17:42.334 --> 17:45.302
Marvin, 911!
We just ran out of propane!

17:45.337 --> 17:48.639
Shoot, we'll never get the grill
up to 400 degrees now!

17:48.673 --> 17:52.843
Ain't no tailgate without
properly seared turkey burgers.

17:52.878 --> 17:55.312
Okay, everyone, pack it up.

17:55.347 --> 17:57.548
We're drivin' back to Texas.

17:57.582 --> 18:00.117
Wait! Did you
say 400 degrees?

18:00.151 --> 18:05.856
Marvin, Laura, it's time
for <i>me</i> to give back to <i>you.</i>

18:05.891 --> 18:07.358
(engine revving,
burgers sizzling)

18:07.392 --> 18:10.761
Three minutes in
neutral at 5,000 RPMs!

18:10.795 --> 18:13.264
That engine block's at
precisely 400 degrees.

18:13.298 --> 18:14.431
(whoops)
Yay!

18:14.466 --> 18:16.467
Yee-haw!

18:20.105 --> 18:21.906
I think you're an amazing girl,

18:21.940 --> 18:24.842
but I'm just not sure
this is gonna work.

18:24.876 --> 18:26.110
(crying)

18:26.144 --> 18:29.513
Not even with youthful
holiday wig?

18:29.548 --> 18:32.850
I would say <i>especially</i>
with youthful holiday wig.

18:32.884 --> 18:34.585
Come on, Mah Mah.

18:34.619 --> 18:36.186
Everyone's waiting
to eat dessert

18:36.221 --> 18:37.922
and is very embarrassed
for you.

18:37.956 --> 18:39.990
(crying)

18:41.593 --> 18:42.993
Sorry about that.

18:43.028 --> 18:45.930
You want to come downstairs
and have some pie?

18:45.964 --> 18:49.099
Or stay up here and do the same?

18:49.134 --> 18:53.537
Sorry, Hayley.
I've made <i>other</i> dessert plans.

18:53.572 --> 18:55.239
Hayley, you didn't think

18:55.273 --> 18:58.208
I was gonna let Big Wang slip
through my fingers, did you?

18:58.243 --> 19:00.611
Come on, I've still got
two big installs tonight,

19:00.645 --> 19:03.747
but only one more job to do,
if you get my drift.

19:11.890 --> 19:14.892
Marvin, Laura,
various other hicks,

19:14.926 --> 19:18.796
that was the best Thanksgiving
dinner I've ever had.

19:18.830 --> 19:20.798
Who is this guy?!

19:20.832 --> 19:23.467
Exactly! Who am I?

19:23.501 --> 19:25.269
Who am I to you?

19:25.303 --> 19:28.138
Me, a Redskins fan,
you, all Cowboys fans.

19:28.173 --> 19:31.442
(whooping)

19:31.476 --> 19:33.444
(whooping)
Anyone seen my kid?

19:33.478 --> 19:34.845
(whooping)

19:34.879 --> 19:37.481
We couldn't be more opposite
on this day.

19:37.515 --> 19:39.750
But you welcomed me
into your parking space

19:39.784 --> 19:41.318
and taught me how to survive.

19:41.353 --> 19:42.586
'Course we did, Stan.

19:42.621 --> 19:43.988
'Cause where we come from,

19:44.022 --> 19:46.390
Thanksgiving's about
sharing diverse cultures,

19:46.424 --> 19:49.627
no matter who you are or
how much your team sucks.

19:50.662 --> 19:52.696
Or how Chinese you are!

19:52.731 --> 19:54.832
(whooping)

19:54.866 --> 19:57.935
Seriously, I'm gonna be in real
trouble if I can't find him.

19:57.969 --> 19:59.336
(whooping)

20:02.407 --> 20:05.476
I'm home!
I made it home!

20:05.510 --> 20:07.411
Stan, where have you been?!

20:07.445 --> 20:09.713
You took the trash out
hours ago!

20:09.748 --> 20:11.615
I've been to a wonderful place.

20:11.650 --> 20:14.518
I was tailgating in the parking
lot with Cowboys fans.

20:14.552 --> 20:17.121
They taught me how to make
a vest out of foam fingers,

20:17.155 --> 20:19.890
and I taught them
how to cook burgers on my car.

20:19.924 --> 20:22.026
And I learned the true meaning
of Thanksgiving.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.994
That you should accept everyone,

20:24.029 --> 20:27.264
no matter their team colors
or their skin color or...

20:27.298 --> 20:28.732
or how horrible they are.

20:28.767 --> 20:31.769
Oh, that's sweet, Stan.

20:31.803 --> 20:34.805
Wait. Why would there be Cowboys
fans at the Redskins game?

20:34.839 --> 20:38.042
The Cowboys always play
in Dallas on Thanksgiving.

20:38.755 --> 20:41.198
What?
They're gonna ask at Comic-Con.

20:41.318 --> 20:42.458
We better have an answer!
