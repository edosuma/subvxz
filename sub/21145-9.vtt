standing here as a child?

10:49.483 --> 10:51.610

to poverty

So when I was a child,
standing here,

10:56.323 --> 10:59.451

from my hood,

10:59.493 --> 11:01.495
a girl who got an opportunity.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.913
She got a scholarship
to go to a prep school, Choate.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.915
It changed her life forever.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.917
I of course had to stay here

11:07.959 --> 11:10.003

on these streets.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.674

11:15.716 --> 11:17.511

that Mike Sandoval

Less than 24 hours later
he was dead.

Mike Sandoval was
a dirty prosecutor

he sent there.

But, you know,
in order to do that,

12:33.420 --> 12:34.962

12:35.004 --> 12:36.797
I don't have enough money
to invest, Tasha.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.425
