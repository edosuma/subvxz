WEBVTT

00:02.290 --> 00:03.619
Eight years ago,
I was lead prosecutor

00:03.620 --> 00:05.499
on a murder trial
that divided the country.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.039
When the jury found
movie star Sevvy Johnson

00:08.039 --> 00:10.119
not guilty of double homicide,

00:10.120 --> 00:11.289
I was devastated.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.289
You did everything
you could, Maya.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.459
I left that life
and everyone in it behind.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.249
Then the unthinkable happened.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.250
He killed again.

00:18.251 --> 00:19.499
You have to come back, Maya.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.919
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.289
Jessica brought
the jacket to me...

00:23.290 --> 00:24.999
Evidence
that he was beating her.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.619
I'm willing to offer $18 million

00:27.620 --> 00:30.289
for information leading
to Jessica's real killer.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.249
No! Come on!
What are you doing?!

00:32.250 --> 00:34.209
No, please! You know I can't go
back to the boss empty-handed.

00:34.210 --> 00:36.169
My assistant... she'll wire you
whatever you need.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.289
N-No! No!

00:38.330 --> 00:39.829
We can't afford
to keep the uniform

00:39.830 --> 00:41.169
on protection detail anymore.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.119
Maya's stalker...
Leaving gifts at her doorstep.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.169
He just murdered a man
in Maya's living room.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.619
Least your case
just got a whole lot easier.

00:49.620 --> 00:51.919
With Wolf's guy out of the way?

00:51.920 --> 00:52.999
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.540
I'll see you tomorrow, Leo.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.119
I think I said too much.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.579
I talk too much sometimes.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.879
Gets me in trouble.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.379
I should really
get back to my hotel.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.499
My boyfriend's waiting.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.619
Day 25.

01:09.620 --> 01:10.829
What?

01:10.830 --> 01:12.209
First pair of earrings
I gave you

01:12.210 --> 01:14.119
during
the Severen Johnson trial.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.329
You wore them... day 25.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.329
You knew I'd be watching.
Y-Y-You wore them on TV, right?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.999
I-I wanted to show
my appreciation.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.999
Then you left. Eight years ago,
you just vanished on me.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.619
You should have told me
they were from you.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.879
I would have thanked you.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.499
When you came back,
I was going to. I was, you know?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.579
But it seemed like he's...

01:32.580 --> 01:35.459
He's always around, you know?

01:35.460 --> 01:37.169
I know you, Maya.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.419
How you eat
a spoonful of peanut butter

01:39.420 --> 01:40.749
when your blood sugar's low

01:40.750 --> 01:43.669
and how you watch HGTV
when you're stressed

01:43.670 --> 01:46.039
and the Food Network
when you're lonely.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.879
I-I know you're allergic
to penicillin.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.290
I know sometimes you need
comfort more than advice.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.000
Does he know you like that?

01:56.330 --> 01:59.289
Is he willing to do anything
to make you happy?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.330
Maya.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.000
I killed a man for you.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.619
Get back here!

02:21.250 --> 02:22.789
Aah!

02:27.620 --> 02:28.829
Ugh!

02:28.830 --> 02:30.329
Aah!

02:30.330 --> 02:31.669
Unh!

02:31.670 --> 02:34.289
Maya!!

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.830 --> 02:54.830
Unh!

02:55.671 --> 02:58.829
Help! Somebody please help!

02:58.830 --> 03:00.499
Please!

03:10.120 --> 03:11.169
Maya?

03:11.170 --> 03:12.829
Oh, my God.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.830
CJ.

03:13.830 --> 03:14.830
You're okay.

03:14.831 --> 03:16.669
You're okay. You're okay.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.879
You're okay. I got you.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.209
Are you sure you're all right?
You're not injured?

03:33.210 --> 03:34.499
The medic checked me out.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.669
I just have a few scrapes.
I'm fine.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.619
Leo's worked in this building
longer than I have.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.829
You never know.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.499
I've had his security clearance
deactivated

03:41.500 --> 03:43.539
and tripled the number of guards
around the building.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.879
Surveillance cameras show
that he left the parking garage

03:45.880 --> 03:47.419
and fled south.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.120
Police are canvassing the area
and checking his house.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.709
Riv. You okay?

03:53.710 --> 03:55.249
Yeah.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.960
Yeah. Hi.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.830
Been worried sick.

04:10.670 --> 04:11.829
You.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.619
I told you
she needed more protection.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.418
Look, I-I'm pissed, too,
but this is on LAPD.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.249
They pulled Maya's
security detail out of spite.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.959
I don't care if I have to
wake up Chief Roberts

04:20.959 --> 04:22.249
out of his own damn bed.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.999
I'm gonna get you guys
shadowed 24/7

04:24.000 --> 04:25.329
till this psycho's caught.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.579
You stare, you're unemployed.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.499
Hey. Oh, hey.
How you feeling, mate?

04:55.500 --> 04:58.039
Well, I won't be wearing
flip-flops anytime soon,

04:58.040 --> 05:00.619
but otherwise...

05:00.620 --> 05:03.079
What are you doing... here?

05:03.080 --> 05:05.249
In all the commotion,
I forgot to tell you last night.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.499
Your friend, uh... Georgia?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.459
Angela? She quit.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.499
My day's already getting better.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.329
Yeah, I wanted to come in
and look over

05:13.330 --> 05:14.709
all of these tips
that are coming.

05:14.710 --> 05:15.829
Sevvy, you're wasting your time.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.169
Angela was right
about one thing.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.999
$18 million brings out
all the crazies.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.419
No, listen.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.959
I found something real.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.289
Yeah.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.539
A valet at The Mandeville
in Las Vegas

05:26.540 --> 05:28.669
says that he saw Jessica
in the hotel

05:28.670 --> 05:30.499
last President's Day weekend.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.329
No, no, it's true.
She was there.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.119
And what does that
have to do with her murder?

05:34.120 --> 05:37.959
The valet says
that he saw some... dude...

05:37.960 --> 05:40.119
grab her in an Aston Martin.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.079
She lied, Wolf.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.919
She was bloody cheating on me.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.039
Well, that doesn't mean you need
to go to this dark place.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.709
No, it's all making
a whole lot of sense.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.329
I mean, after she came back
from the trip,

05:49.330 --> 05:51.119
she seemed different, distant.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.750
I mean, that's why I hired...
Buck to follow her.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.580
What if this guy killed her?

05:59.170 --> 06:01.329
I'll find somebody new.
We'll check it out.

06:01.330 --> 06:04.209
Not good enough, mate.

06:04.210 --> 06:05.619
I'm going myself. Oh... No.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.919
And you're coming with me.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.079
Yeah.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.039
I just quit gambling.
You want me to go to Vegas?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.169
I'll keep you out of trouble.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.919
You've only got
nine toes to spare.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.169
How am I supposed to
convince Judge Song

06:17.170 --> 06:18.879
to let you out of the state?

06:18.880 --> 06:22.000
Like you said, it's why
I pay you the big bucks.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.789
I don't know
what you said to the Chief,

06:25.790 --> 06:29.079
but I've had two unis on me
like glue, so thanks.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.329
It's the least I could do.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.669
Your safety is
our number-one concern.

06:32.670 --> 06:34.249
But since you're here...

06:34.250 --> 06:36.669
I heard that Julianne Johnson
paid you a visit last night?

06:36.670 --> 06:38.249
She owned up
to planting the jacket,

06:38.250 --> 06:39.959
and she's willing to testify.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.379
Which means Wolf can't try

06:41.380 --> 06:43.119
to torpedo
the rest of our evidence.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.329
He's trying
to torpedo Gabe Johnson.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.709
This morning, we received a copy

06:46.710 --> 06:49.379
of a signed affidavit
from his sister, Star.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.959
She says Gabe followed
her and Sevvy into the woods,

06:51.960 --> 06:54.709
and that Gabe assaulted Sevvy
without provocation.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.499
There's no mention
of a duffel bag being burned

06:56.500 --> 06:57.919
or of one at all.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.669
That is
a complete and total lie.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.999
Well, it's a lie
the jury very well may believe.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.329
Wolf's already done a number
on Gabe's credibility.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.999
He hit Sevvy in self-defense.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.499
Well, I'm concerned
he's spinning out.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.329
I put in a call
to the motel we've had him in.

07:09.330 --> 07:10.879
They haven't seen him
for two days.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.169
All I know is,
we have one person

07:12.170 --> 07:14.499
saying there's a bag
of potentially damning evidence

07:14.500 --> 07:16.829
and one person saying
it never existed.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.619
This is a problem.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.619
We need to get Star Johnson
on our side.

07:20.620 --> 07:21.999
You need to flip her.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.169
'Cause right now, our case is
hanging on by a damn thread.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.329
Am I under arrest?

07:34.330 --> 07:36.499
That's my new security detail.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.749
It's a long story.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.750
Can we talk?

07:38.751 --> 07:39.790
Come in.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.289
I need to ask you a favor.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.500
The D.A.'s office
should put me on retainer.

07:48.830 --> 07:49.830
Gabe?

07:49.831 --> 07:51.459
What's going on?

07:51.460 --> 07:54.169
Been worried about you.
I heard you left the motel.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.169
He's staying here with me now.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.209
Is that why you came?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.579
No, Star...
Wolf has her on record

07:59.580 --> 08:02.999
saying the bag Sevvy gave you
never existed.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.789
She's lying.

08:04.790 --> 08:05.829
I believe you.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.419
Wolf is trying
to use your daughter

08:07.420 --> 08:08.789
to create reasonable doubt,

08:08.790 --> 08:10.829
but I think
I have a way to fix it.

08:10.830 --> 08:13.579
If you could convince her to
come in and give a deposition

08:13.580 --> 08:16.289
saying she was coerced into
making a false statement...

08:16.290 --> 08:18.619
Star is her father's daughter.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.579
That child has defied
being controlled

08:20.580 --> 08:22.169
since the moment
she came out of the womb.

08:22.170 --> 08:23.669
Then she should know
what she's up against,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.579
because if she gets on the stand
and lies,

08:25.580 --> 08:27.039
I'll go after her for perjury.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.619
That sounds like an ultimatum.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.499
Not my intention.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.749
I just want you
to be aware of the stakes.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.919
I am.

08:34.919 --> 08:38.789
All Maya wants is
for Star to tell the truth.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.499
Okay.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.749
I'll do what I can.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.209
No, please.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.919
I have a friend
who's part owner at Rocado.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.579
Nine-month waiting list.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.170
You name the day, the time?
You're in.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.080
No, thank you, Judge Song.
Thank you.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.169
Ugh. She is insufferable.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.709
But I did get you permission
to go to Vegas.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.169
Oh, great.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.329
You know, this little jaunt to
Sin City could be your demise.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.329
Right now, we're golden.
Maya Travis' case is crumbling.

09:11.330 --> 09:12.669
It's getting weaker every day,

09:12.670 --> 09:14.039
largely thanks
to my machinations.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.419
I know, Wolf.
You're a genius, okay?

09:16.420 --> 09:18.169
We start turning over rocks

09:18.170 --> 09:20.169
without knowing
what's underneath?

09:20.170 --> 09:21.829
That is gambling.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.169
Listen, call the airport.
We're going.

09:24.170 --> 09:25.829
Judge says you can't fly.

09:25.830 --> 09:26.830
No.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.039
Guess we're taking a road trip.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.169
Thanks for calling.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.249
Yeah, no problem.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.669
Still processing the scene,

09:42.670 --> 09:44.499
but I figured you'd want
to take a look for yourself.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.039
Leo killed Buck
and tried to kill Maya.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.169
Hell yeah, I do.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.289
So, there's nothing here

09:48.290 --> 09:50.119
that speaks
to where he may have fled.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.879
No family in town,
no friends, so...

09:52.880 --> 09:54.919
Wait till you see in here.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.789
Did you see this scrapbook?

10:02.790 --> 10:03.919
Yeah.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.789
And check this out.

10:14.790 --> 10:16.959
We dug up some audio files
from his computer.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.789
Yeah, um, can I get
a chicken salad?

10:20.790 --> 10:22.039
No, wa... scratch that.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.749
A-A cheeseburger, fries,
and a large coffee?

10:24.750 --> 10:26.459
So he planted bugs
in the war room,

10:26.460 --> 10:27.879
her house, and in her car?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.459
Yeah.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.710
That sicko wanted to know
her every move.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.289
Oh, Leo.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.460
Big mistake.

10:37.710 --> 10:38.790
Big.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.119
So, you want me to use
the bug in my car to lure Leo?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.119
He could be out there,
hiding somewhere,

10:45.120 --> 10:46.669
waiting to hear
where you're gonna be next.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.289
So then what...
I just drive around

10:48.290 --> 10:49.880
until he starts following me?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.249
No.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.169
Use me... as bait.

10:54.170 --> 10:55.999
What?
I'm the one who provoked him.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.499
All right, who, in his mind,

10:57.500 --> 10:59.209
is keeping you
from being with him.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.669
I'm a natural target.

11:00.670 --> 11:03.619
Leo's already killed one person.
It's too risky. No.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.999
James can help.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.499
We have the LAPD
on our side now.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.249
We could do this.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.209
We could keep him safe.

11:11.210 --> 11:13.379
Maya... look.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.379
This is our best chance.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.379
We could end this... right now.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.249
You're sure about this?

11:28.500 --> 11:29.669
Okay.

11:29.670 --> 11:30.999
Let's do it.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.249
Let's stalk the stalker.

11:58.290 --> 12:02.119
Honey, I, uh... I wasn't
expecting a table for three.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.329
I know. I'm sorry.

12:03.330 --> 12:04.959
This is Brianna Dear. She's a...

12:04.960 --> 12:08.289
Political consultant.
Your reputation precedes you.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.119
I apologize for the intrusion,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.379
but I had a last-minute opening
in my schedule.

12:12.380 --> 12:15.499
Brianna and I met through
friends at Perch last week.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.619
I let it slip that you were
planning to announce

12:17.620 --> 12:19.749
your D.A. candidacy soon.

12:19.750 --> 12:23.379
Matthew, I'm paid quite a lot
to be realistic... and blunt.

12:23.380 --> 12:24.999
Okay. The buzz around town

12:25.000 --> 12:27.619
is that the Johnson case has
become a complete disaster.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.879
But I have a plan that will
save your political future.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.249
Resign immediately.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.169
Denounce Maya Travis
and Alan Wiest for incompetence.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.999
Then announce you're running
on a platform

12:37.000 --> 12:39.540
promising to clean house
at the D.A.'s office.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.329
You are blunt.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.249
And I have a 1:30 across town.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.499
If you decide you want
to take this to the next level,

12:47.500 --> 12:48.669
give me a call.

12:48.670 --> 12:49.999
I can get you there.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.620
Wow.

12:59.621 --> 13:01.669
I know. It's not subtle.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.329
Subtle?

13:03.330 --> 13:05.500
Honey, it's slash-and-burn.
I won't do it.

13:07.170 --> 13:08.999
You're a loyal man, Matthew.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.579
It's one of the things
I love most about you.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.289
But you already saved Maya once.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.250
You can't keep saving her.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.619
It's time to start thinking
about you.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.539
The police think that Leo may
know where we've been staying.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.960
So we can't go back
to the hotel.

13:30.790 --> 13:32.119
I'm sick of relying on the cops.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.669
You give me two minutes
with that psycho,

13:33.670 --> 13:35.039
and he will not
bother you again.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.670
Don't talk like that.
Let them handle it.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.249
Well, then, where are we
supposed to go?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.789
My friend Denise has
a vacation home in Topanga.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.330
I've stayed there before.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.119
That would be nice...
Get out of the city.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.709
Get a little alone time.

13:50.710 --> 13:52.829
I'll give her a call.
It should be okay.

13:52.830 --> 13:54.209
Why don't I drop you
here at the office?

13:54.210 --> 13:55.669
You'll be safe
until they catch him.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.669
I'll head to the hotel
and grab our stuff,

13:57.670 --> 13:58.999
and then get up to Topanga.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.169
I'll text you the address
and the lock box code,

14:01.170 --> 14:02.209
but you can't miss it.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.959
It's just north
of Lookout Trail.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.330
There's a rooster
on the mailbox.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.080
Sounds good.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.169
Love you.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.210
Be careful.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.209
I love you, too.

14:16.210 --> 14:17.919
And I will.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.209
And now we wait.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Okay.

14:46.001 --> 14:47.750
Initials here and here.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.119
Signature here.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.079
Automobile travel
to and from Las Vegas only.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.209
One overnight stay.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.209
Any violation will
land you back in jail.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.289
Thank you, officer.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.499
You realize that ankle bracelet
has full GPS.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.999
Those rocks
we talked about turning over?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.079
Maya Travis is gonna know where
every single one of them is.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.209
Wolf, I don't care.

15:06.210 --> 15:08.169
I need to know
why Jessica went to Vegas.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.170
Let's go.

15:09.171 --> 15:10.500
You got to promise me.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.710
You cannot let me gamble.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.879
Not even a nickel slot.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.379
I won't let you out of my sight.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.420
Come on.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.329
Wolf?

15:21.330 --> 15:22.499
Keys?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.499
I'm driving.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.120
Right. Yeah.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.169
Be gentle.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.249
That's my baby.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.670
Been hours.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.539
Maybe he's not gonna come.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.079
You have to be patient.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.830
Just want it over with.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.620
CJ, checking in.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.959
She can be
a little overprotective.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.419
I like CJ.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.749
She said she was gonna
kick my ass

16:04.750 --> 16:06.329
if I let anything happen to you.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.169
You know she actually handpicked
the surveillance team outside?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.169
Maya wanted
to call the whole thing off.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.119
Thought it was too dangerous.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.329
Ironic, isn't it?

16:15.330 --> 16:17.619
How the women in our lives
can be protective of us,

16:17.620 --> 16:19.749
but the second we're even
a little protective of them...

16:19.750 --> 16:22.749
We get the "I can
take care of myself" speech.

16:22.750 --> 16:23.750
Yes.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.169
Haven't you heard, man?

16:25.170 --> 16:26.669
Chivalry is dead.

16:26.670 --> 16:28.209
I'm a cowboy.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.959
Chivalry will never be dead.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.579
Have you heard from James?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.039
Nope. Radio silence.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.669
Same with Riv.
It's driving me crazy.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.329
You know, this is weird.

16:47.330 --> 16:50.579
I'm looking at this old
security footage of Leo.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.249
Three days last week,
he goes down

16:52.250 --> 16:53.879
this basement hallway
with a bag,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.289
and then comes back
with nothing.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.619
What's at the end
of the hallway?

16:57.620 --> 16:59.079
I don't know.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.039
Boiler room? Storage closet?

17:02.040 --> 17:04.959
He was stashing something.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.329
Yeah?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.169
Okay. Copy that.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.209
No sign of Leo outside.

17:13.210 --> 17:14.829
Probably just the wind.
It's picking up.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.829
Gonna go take a look.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.789
You stay here.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.539
Oh, my God. You're okay.

19:13.540 --> 19:14.829
I got a murder kit
in the basement

19:14.830 --> 19:15.919
and fresh blood on a ladder.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.379
I cut Leo's face.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.669
What if he came back in the
building after he attacked you?

19:19.670 --> 19:20.919
What if he never left?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.829
How is that possible?
We swept the entire place.

19:22.830 --> 19:25.499
He's a security guard! He knows
this building better than anybody.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.669
He found a place to hide.

19:26.670 --> 19:27.999
We need to put the building
on lockdown.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.380
I'll call Matthew.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.459
He's not answering.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.499
Go to hell.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.119
You got some fight in you,
Matthew.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.499
Tell me what it is
that you want.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Maybe I can help you.

19:57.501 --> 19:58.830
You can't help.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.959
This all went wrong.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.670
It's too late now.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.919
You're frustrated.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.079
I get that.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.749
And, uh...

20:13.750 --> 20:17.539
I'm guessing...
you want to talk to Maya.

20:17.540 --> 20:19.749
Right?

20:19.750 --> 20:21.289
I can arrange that.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.209
You think you know her, huh?

20:23.210 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.001 --> 20:25.290
Not like I do!

20:27.710 --> 20:30.290
I spent hours
listening to her voice.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.119
Getting to know
the real Maya Travis.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.169
What she really wants.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.499
Okay.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.669
And what is that?

20:45.670 --> 20:47.419
Ohh.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.119
I think you know.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.460
Deep down, you know.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.709
I just wanted to help her.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.829
I took risks for that girl.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.959
But she doesn't care.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.329
And she needs to know
that there's a price for that!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.329
James?

21:19.580 --> 21:20.669
James?

21:28.170 --> 21:29.329
Hey.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.829
Leo's not going to the cabin.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.749
What? How do you know that?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.169
He's still in the office, Riv.

21:34.170 --> 21:35.249
He's here.

21:55.170 --> 21:58.709
You should be grateful,
you know.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.169
Yeah?

22:00.170 --> 22:01.329
Why's that?

22:01.330 --> 22:04.169
You and Maya...
You have something special.

22:04.170 --> 22:05.459
You know,
I've seen you two together.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.499
I've heard your private talks.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.169
Maya doesn't think of me
that way.

22:09.170 --> 22:11.670
Oh, come on.
We both know that's a lie.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.379
You're a lucky guy.

22:16.380 --> 22:19.829
At least you know...

22:19.830 --> 22:21.290
she'll miss you
when you're gone.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.419
Listen.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.919
I know it's hard.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.079
I really appreciate you coming.
Yep.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.379
I made reservations at the MGM.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.879
We'll check in, go straight
to the rooms, all right?

23:15.880 --> 23:18.919
Unh-unh. We can't stay there.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.749
What? Why not?

23:20.750 --> 23:22.919
I've been black-booked.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.419
Casino term for "banned."

23:24.420 --> 23:25.579
Very hostile pit boss

23:25.580 --> 23:27.249
alleges he caught me
counting cards, but...

23:27.250 --> 23:28.749
God. Whatever.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.999
All right, listen,
I'll... I'll call the Wynn.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.999
Maybe they got
a penthouse available.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.879
Yeah. Have to avoid
that one, too.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.999
Is there anywhere
you haven't been banned, man?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.329
Must be. Uh...

23:42.330 --> 23:44.829
Look, just please tell me
you haven't done anything

23:44.830 --> 23:46.079
to piss off The Mandeville.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.579
We're gonna need to look
at those security tapes of Jess.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.749
Well, technically, I've been
black-booked there, too...

23:50.750 --> 23:51.750
For life.

23:51.750 --> 23:52.710
Wolf.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.709
B-But I have a plan.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.209
I have a plan.

24:09.750 --> 24:10.960
Matthew!

24:13.250 --> 24:15.459
Are you okay?

24:15.460 --> 24:18.580
Hurts like a son of a bitch,
but apparently, I'll live.

24:21.330 --> 24:23.960
Why did Leo come after you?
Did he say something?

24:27.080 --> 24:29.749
Eh... not a word.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.209
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

24:32.210 --> 24:34.249
It's over.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.750
I guess you're right.

24:37.420 --> 24:39.249
Matthew, I...

24:44.670 --> 24:45.960
I know.

24:47.330 --> 24:48.419
Me too.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.169
Hey.

25:15.170 --> 25:17.419
Hi.

25:17.420 --> 25:20.119
IA just put me
on administrative leave.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.829
It's... standard procedure.

25:22.830 --> 25:26.000
What you went through
is anything but standard.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.830
I just killed someone.

25:31.170 --> 25:32.789
I know that I had to, but...

25:32.790 --> 25:36.460
You saved Matthew's life
and probably mine.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.460
You're a hero.

25:44.380 --> 25:46.919
Thank you for coming over
at the last minute.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.960
I think a proper family dinner
is long overdue, don't you?

25:51.830 --> 25:54.039
That's what we're calling it?

25:54.040 --> 25:55.829
Family dinner?

25:55.830 --> 25:57.119
What would you like to call it?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.669
An ambush.

25:58.670 --> 26:01.619
You should've told me
that Gabe was here.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.579
Look, I'm sorry for everything.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.829
I just... I... I can't...
I can't do this.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.669
Hang on. Hang on.
I'm not mad at you.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.499
I get it. This...

26:10.500 --> 26:12.669
This thing's screwed up
the both of us.

26:12.670 --> 26:15.169
Which is why
I wanted us all to come together

26:15.170 --> 26:17.539
and make peace.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.119
Come on.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.829
It's just dinner.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.539
All families
have their problems.

26:22.540 --> 26:26.039
The best families
figure out how to solve them.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.999
Now... sit down,
and let's say grace.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.619
Dear Lord,
thank you for the grace

26:43.620 --> 26:48.499
that you bestow on us
in these trying times.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.919
And, Father,
give us the strength

26:50.920 --> 26:55.379
that we need
to stand together as a family

26:55.380 --> 26:58.709
and remember that
we are united in your name.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.420
Amen.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.079
Oh, boy.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.959
This place
really does feel like home.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.459
Mm.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.709
A home that steals your money
and kicks you out.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.999
I didn't say "a good home."

27:12.000 --> 27:13.829
What's the plan here, Wolf?

27:13.830 --> 27:15.959
Well, we can't just
waltz up to the front desk

27:15.960 --> 27:17.879
and ask for security footage...
Trust me.

27:17.880 --> 27:21.079
Casinos like to keep
their private security private.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.959
Unless, of course,
you know the right people.

27:26.290 --> 27:27.459
Who the hell is that?

27:27.460 --> 27:29.500
With any luck, the right people.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.499
Stephanie.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.669
What brings you all the way up
to the top floor?

27:35.670 --> 27:38.079
A headache I do not need today.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.669
Why are you
back in my hotel, Ezra?

27:39.670 --> 27:42.329
Well, would you believe me
if I said I miss you?

27:42.330 --> 27:44.329
I believe you miss
the blackjack table.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.499
Mm-hmm.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.329
Did you think
I wouldn't catch you again?

27:47.330 --> 27:49.999
Well, actually,
I was kind of counting on it.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.169
I need a favor.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.669
I don't do favors.

27:52.670 --> 27:55.329
You have 90 seconds
to clear this room.

27:55.330 --> 27:56.749
Hang on.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.749
I assume you know my client
Sevvy Johnson?

27:59.750 --> 28:00.919
The murderer?

28:00.920 --> 28:02.169
I'm familiar.

28:02.170 --> 28:04.119
I was found innocent.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.289
80 seconds.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.959
Then I assume you know
the most recent instance

28:07.960 --> 28:11.619
of him being accused of a murder
he did not commit.

28:11.620 --> 28:15.329
And it looks like
this casino may be implicated.

28:15.330 --> 28:16.579
Continue.

28:16.580 --> 28:18.829
Jessica Meyer spent
one hell of a weekend here

28:18.830 --> 28:19.999
not too long ago.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.419
Might just be the reason
why she was murdered.

28:22.420 --> 28:25.619
I knew as soon as I saw you,
it was gonna be a bad day.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.919
Mm.

28:26.920 --> 28:27.999
What do you want?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.499
Dig up security footage
of Jessica,

28:30.500 --> 28:35.039
and I will make sure
that what happened in Vegas...

28:35.040 --> 28:36.999
stays out of the news.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.829
Now, how's that for a favor?

28:47.330 --> 28:48.919
Hey.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.209
Thank God you're okay.

28:50.210 --> 28:52.250
Thank God we both are, huh?

28:56.920 --> 28:58.289
How's Matthew doing?

28:58.290 --> 28:59.919
He's in surgery.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.999
Ugh.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.119
Nightmare of a day, huh?

29:02.120 --> 29:04.170
But it's over now.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.539
Yeah.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.669
So why
do you still look worried?

29:10.670 --> 29:11.670
No. What?

29:11.671 --> 29:13.289
No, I'm not worried. Not at all.

29:13.290 --> 29:14.829
I just...

29:14.830 --> 29:15.790
What?

29:15.791 --> 29:17.829
I don't know. Um...

29:17.830 --> 29:21.209
today just got me thinking
about a few things.

29:21.210 --> 29:23.710
Like you... and me.

29:27.250 --> 29:29.619
And our future.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.040
Oh, my God.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.999
And after all the insanity
we've just been through,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.669
our future has never
been more clear.

29:38.670 --> 29:39.709
Riv...

29:39.710 --> 29:41.540
No, no, let me finish.
Let me finish.

29:43.830 --> 29:45.919
Maya.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.000
This... This case has
taken too much from you.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.669
Let's just put it in our past
and have our future...

29:53.670 --> 29:56.829
Just me and you on that farm.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.330
Forever.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.170
Maya Travis...

30:07.250 --> 30:08.879
will you marry me?

30:20.170 --> 30:21.999
I'm not hearing a "Yes."

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
I-It's just...

30:23.001 --> 30:24.289
Oh, man.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.880
You don't have to say it.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.579
I've thought about it.
Of course I have.

30:30.580 --> 30:31.709
I can't just leave.

30:31.710 --> 30:34.249
Well, that's pretty clear.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.459
It's my work. It's a part of me.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.959
No, it used to be a part of you,

30:37.960 --> 30:40.000
but now it's become all of you.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.619
Maya, I never...

30:43.620 --> 30:46.329
I never thought that you could
become this self-destructive.

30:46.330 --> 30:47.459
That's not fair.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.249
Okay, if you don't understand
what I'm doing here,

30:49.250 --> 30:50.379
you don't understand me.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.620
Then I guess I don't,
but, obviously...

30:56.420 --> 30:58.540
I'm in the wrong place.

31:00.330 --> 31:02.169
Riv.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.999
I'm just gonna go pack my bag.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.999
It was nice tonight,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.169
even if your father
couldn't be here.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.379
Is that his choice or yours?

31:20.380 --> 31:21.669
Mine.

31:21.670 --> 31:24.329
Lines need to be drawn, Star.

31:24.330 --> 31:27.119
You used to be
on his side of the line.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.789
I finally faced the truth.

31:28.790 --> 31:31.249
I can't keep protecting him.

31:31.250 --> 31:33.879
I have to do what's right.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.120
And so do you.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.669
I know that you and Gabe

31:39.670 --> 31:41.669
are telling
two different stories

31:41.670 --> 31:43.999
about what happened
to that bag in the woods.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.999
Mom, I don't want
to talk about this!

31:46.000 --> 31:48.499
I'm trying to unburden you.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.879
Tell me what really happened.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.999
I didn't know what to do.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.119
About the bag?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.329
About everything.

32:01.330 --> 32:02.379
I was scared.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.619
I didn't want
Dad to go to prison.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.170
Is that why you burned it?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.619
Just stay out of it.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.419
Star.

32:11.420 --> 32:14.420
Gabe said
there was evidence in it.

32:17.580 --> 32:19.079
Tell me what you saw.

32:26.620 --> 32:28.919
You've got to be kidding.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.419
You're recording me?!

32:30.420 --> 32:31.420
I'm helping you.

32:31.421 --> 32:33.289
That's what Dad said!

32:33.290 --> 32:35.329
Did you know
about this little trap?

32:35.330 --> 32:36.669
It's not a trap.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.999
We just want Dad
to pay for what he did.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.669
Oh, my God. You were in on it.

32:40.670 --> 32:42.499
I mean, Jessica was
your friend, right?

32:42.500 --> 32:44.499
Don't you want to do
the right thing?

32:44.500 --> 32:45.670
For her?

32:48.620 --> 32:51.250
This whole family is toxic!

32:52.170 --> 32:53.959
Star.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.169
Star, wait!

32:59.170 --> 33:00.879
We've been here an hour already.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.169
Yep.

33:02.170 --> 33:05.289
It's gonna take a little time
to go through stuff.

33:05.290 --> 33:06.539
Hello, love.

33:06.540 --> 33:07.999
Don't call me that.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.119
I'm gonna say this quick,
and then I'm gonna hang up.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.209
Slow down. What's happened?

33:12.210 --> 33:13.249
I'm done.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.579
Done? With what?

33:14.580 --> 33:16.329
With all of it!

33:16.330 --> 33:19.459
I'm not going on the stand
for you or for them.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.079
I'm not going
anywhere near this trial.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.289
I am done with this family.

33:24.290 --> 33:25.329
Forever.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.169
Star, please. Listen to me.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.120
Star?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.959
What happened? Bad news?

33:42.170 --> 33:44.999
I don't know what happened.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.579
Star... she won't testify.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.579
Well, we'll get her back.
Don't worry.

33:55.580 --> 33:59.499
My daughter...
S-she... she hates me.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.080
My daughter hasn't talked to me
in six years.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.419
You got a daughter?

34:06.420 --> 34:07.750
Penelope.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.329
She's a lawyer.

34:11.330 --> 34:14.039
Sevvy, the thing about kids...

34:14.040 --> 34:17.329
You can only hurt them
if they love you.

34:17.330 --> 34:19.958
If they don't love you,

34:19.960 --> 34:21.830
they don't care what you do.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.668
Believe me, I know.

34:26.670 --> 34:28.580
Don't make it any easier.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.539
Am I interrupting something?

34:33.540 --> 34:34.579
A welcome interruption.

34:34.580 --> 34:35.998
Please tell us
you found something.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.329
Well, let's just
get this over with

34:37.330 --> 34:39.619
so I can kick you out of my casino.
Mm-hmm.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.119
I found some security footage
on Jessica.

34:42.120 --> 34:45.498
There she is, being picked up
at the front of the hotel.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.579
This guy... who is he?

34:47.580 --> 34:49.918
Well, I can promise you,
it's not what you think it is.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.998
It isn't a date.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.829
I know him... Andre Spencer.

34:52.830 --> 34:55.829
He runs the Tactical Advantage
Shooting Club.

34:55.830 --> 34:57.119
A gun range?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.959
A high-end gun range.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.169
He trains clients
with deep pockets.

35:01.170 --> 35:02.829
Door-to-door service.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.829
Is that a hobby of hers
I don't know about?

35:04.830 --> 35:08.079
No. Jessica hated guns.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.539
She told me she'd never
shot one in her life.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.539
Gentlemen.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.879
What can I do for you?

35:25.880 --> 35:27.749
Tell me what the hell you were
doing with Jessica Meyer.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.999
Sevvy, easy. Act nicely.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.209
Nah, it's cool.

35:30.210 --> 35:32.579
Figured somebody would
come around eventually.

35:32.580 --> 35:35.289
Just wasn't expecting
the great Sevvy Johnson himself.

35:35.290 --> 35:37.169
I'm a big fan of you,
my brother.

35:37.170 --> 35:38.959
I told her that, too.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.669
So you remember Jessica?

35:40.670 --> 35:42.539
Come on, man. I read my TMZ.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.459
I know who she was dating.

35:44.460 --> 35:45.669
We took care of her, believe me.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.749
What do you mean,
you took care of her?

35:47.750 --> 35:49.709
What the hell
was she doing here?

35:49.710 --> 35:50.830
You didn't know about it?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.281
Then I guess there's something
I should probably show you.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.999
Jessica bought
the whole place out.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.499
She said she needed her training
to be quick and private.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.709
Training for what?

36:02.710 --> 36:05.539
She said she got a part
in a movie.

36:05.540 --> 36:08.329
Started off shaky, but as you can
see, she's a fast learner.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.539
Hey.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.789
What gun is she using?

36:23.790 --> 36:27.209
That's the Infinity
Titanium .45.

36:27.210 --> 36:30.289
Not my choice for beginners,
but she only wanted to use that.

36:30.290 --> 36:31.670
Nothing else.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.670
We need a minute.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.039
So, I'm guessing
there was no movie.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.789
Want to tell me
why that gun is so important?

36:41.790 --> 36:45.210
Wolf, that was the same gun
that we have at home.

36:46.710 --> 36:49.499
I kept it right beside
the bed where we slept.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.499
This is the woman I loved.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.539
And I think...

36:57.250 --> 36:58.880
She was planning to kill me.

37:10.210 --> 37:11.829
Maya? Hey, Effy.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.619
I was just looking
for Matthew's room.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.329
He just got out of surgery.

37:15.330 --> 37:18.119
And you're the last person
he needs to see right now.

37:18.120 --> 37:21.039
He almost died...
Because of you.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.209
I don't know
what I was thinking,

37:22.210 --> 37:24.170
convincing Matthew
to bring you back.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.749
What?

37:26.750 --> 37:29.329
I wasn't gonna let Matthew
take the fall

37:29.330 --> 37:31.289
if this case went wrong.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.919
That's the only reason
you're here right now.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.669
I don't understand.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.540
He's planning to run for D.A.

37:39.790 --> 37:43.459
All you are to my husband
is political cover.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.249
My chief deputy,
Matthew Collier,

37:52.250 --> 37:55.169
was overcome
by Ms. Travis' stalker.

37:55.170 --> 37:58.169
Thankfully, his life was saved
through the heroic efforts

37:58.170 --> 38:00.289
of our investigator,
CJ Emerson...

38:00.290 --> 38:01.499
Don't.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.380
He's not worth the spike
in your blood pressure.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.499
Well, the surgeon said
I was lucky.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.499
It was just a deep laceration.
No muscle damage.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.959
And you're getting
a ton of positive press.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.669
For getting tied up
and almost killed?

38:14.670 --> 38:17.170
There's a wave
of public sympathy for you.

38:19.290 --> 38:20.620
I called Brianna.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.039
She said we should
take advantage of the moment

38:24.040 --> 38:25.959
and announce your candidacy.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.289
I want to hold off on that.

38:32.290 --> 38:35.709
Take some time to think
about what we really want.

38:37.830 --> 38:39.580
This is what we want.

38:41.330 --> 38:43.329
And we need to strike
while the iron's hot.

38:43.330 --> 38:44.619
Effy.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.879
I'm scheduling
a press conference for Friday.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.920
We can do it right here
in the hospital.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.499
I'll go get you some ice chips.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.999
Maya, it's Julianne.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.579
I spoke to Star
about what we discussed.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.329
She's not gonna help us.

39:17.330 --> 39:19.329
I'm sorry.

39:37.710 --> 39:39.749
He gave me this
when we got home.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.880
He did it again.

39:44.830 --> 39:46.459
I laughed too hard

39:46.460 --> 39:49.119
when Gabe made fun
of Sevvy's crappy golf swing.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.619
I'm such an idiot.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.879
My dad tried to warn me,
and I should have listened.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.669
I can't believe it.

40:29.670 --> 40:31.919
She was gonna kill me.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.579
Calm down, Sevvy.

40:33.580 --> 40:34.619
Must have been her plan...

40:34.620 --> 40:36.419
To kill me
and take all my money.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.379
That doesn't even make sense.

40:38.380 --> 40:40.119
You and Jessica weren't married.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.999
She wouldn't have gotten a dime.
What the hell was she doing, then?

40:42.000 --> 40:45.709
Training at a gun range
like a bloody assassin?

40:45.710 --> 40:47.919
Maybe Star's right.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.169
I turn everyone I love
against me.

40:50.170 --> 40:51.789
Why didn't she just leave you?

40:51.790 --> 40:53.879
I mean, I gave her everything.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.879
She wasn't
who you thought she was.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.749
I didn't know who I was
bloody living with.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.170
That's the question.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.829
All this time.

41:02.830 --> 41:05.079
All this time, you were...

41:07.670 --> 41:09.250
Oh, my God.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.290
You actually might be innocent.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.789
I've watched this a thousand
times and never noticed.

41:16.790 --> 41:18.419
The only reason
why I noticed it now

41:18.420 --> 41:22.249
is because I pressed "Pause"
at the right time.

41:22.250 --> 41:23.999
You see it?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.789
It could be an artifact,
a flaw in the tape.

41:26.790 --> 41:28.829
Let me play it frame by frame.

41:28.830 --> 41:30.709
Look at the right side.

41:34.210 --> 41:35.999
That's a shadow.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.209
Somebody else
was in the storage unit

41:38.210 --> 41:40.669
when Jessica made these tapes.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.829
I laughed too hard

41:46.830 --> 41:51.039
when Gabe made fun
of his crappy golf swing.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.789
I'm such an idiot.

41:53.790 --> 41:56.790
My dad tried to warn me,
and I should have listened.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.789
Wait.

41:59.790 --> 42:01.420
I need to say his name.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.789
I forgot to say
"Sevvy's crappy golf swing."

42:07.790 --> 42:09.669
Let's start over.
