WEBVTT

01:01.160 --> 01:02.200
I’m leaving.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.090
If we leave now, we can make it to fourth.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.300
I’m not going.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.300
Just because you’re smart doesn’t mean you get a pass.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.450
Kind of does.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.450
Why do you have your backpack then?

03:13.350 --> 03:14.870
Why do you have your backpack then?

03:14.920 --> 03:16.550
Just saying, but okay.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.260
Shit.

03:40.580 --> 03:43.930
She was shitty at getting it over, don’t you remember?

03:45.500 --> 03:49.530
Well, that’s why Sheri should be in the front, she’s the most intimidating.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.530
You call that intimidating?

03:52.820 --> 03:57.890
I mean, I almost knocked you out in practice a couple weeks ago, or do you not remember that?

03:59.690 --> 04:02.960
To be fair, she was on the ground for five minutes, so it makes sense that she doesn’t remember.

04:05.180 --> 04:06.820
At least I can laugh about it now.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.530
We should go watch him play.

04:18.560 --> 04:18.950
Who?

04:19.800 --> 04:20.670
Really?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.880
You’re still into that?

04:24.520 --> 04:29.330
I mean, he’s never been not a thing.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.230
Girl, you can do so much better.

04:32.230 --> 04:37.960
He’s so cute though. Really, you’re saying that to me now?

04:38.460 --> 04:44.690
I mean, he’s super cute. What’s the issue?

04:46.300 --> 04:48.260
Just saying, you’ve been hung up for a while.

04:49.090 --> 04:51.120
Do you guys smell that?

04:51.530 --> 04:53.250
It smells like swamp.

04:53.570 --> 04:55.150
You forget to brush your teeth this morning?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.630
She’s so deluded.

05:12.120 --> 05:12.700
Ready?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.090
Yes.

05:20.050 --> 05:37.320
I was a child and she was a child, in this kingdom by the sea. But we loved with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee. With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted, her and me.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.190
What are you doing?

06:07.520 --> 06:09.330
What does it look like I’m doing?

06:11.220 --> 06:11.890
Why?

06:14.020 --> 06:15.380
Because I like it.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.240
Focus on your own stuff.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.400
Okay, okay. What else?

06:41.070 --> 06:41.830
Love?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.770
Yes, but what kind?

06:45.310 --> 06:46.540
Unconditional?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
There we go.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.560
Class started 15 minutes ago.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.460
I have a note.

06:59.430 --> 07:00.150
Fake.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.440
Shh. Quiet.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.780
Am I the only one that’s been thinking about this?

07:30.780 --> 07:32.780
Well, I remember it but, yeah.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.740
But they’re older and...

07:34.740 --> 07:35.870
And what does that mean?

07:35.890 --> 07:40.360
That means that they’re more interesting. They got more things to talk about. They got more things to do.

07:40.410 --> 07:41.530
Oh. Okay.

07:41.590 --> 07:42.770
They’re mature.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
I like them mature, so.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.240
Ah, drinks.

07:48.750 --> 07:49.370
I’m sold.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.370
Right! Yes!

07:53.390 --> 07:55.270
You were too easy to get there.

07:55.460 --> 07:55.990
What!

07:55.990 --> 07:57.310
Yeah, that was way too easy.

07:57.310 --> 07:57.730
I’m not easy.
Yeah, that was way too easy.

07:57.730 --> 07:58.160
I’m not easy.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.840
I’m so not touching that.

08:01.870 --> 08:03.840
Listen, gotta start somewhere, right?

08:58.850 --> 08:59.420
Nah.

09:04.490 --> 09:05.060
You’re good.

09:06.970 --> 09:07.760
Thanks.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.530
How long have you been back?

09:11.440 --> 09:12.530
Six months.

09:14.047 --> 09:15.562
You know, I don’t live very far from you.

09:15.918 --> 09:16.488
Oh, yeah?

09:16.530 --> 09:17.604
I don’t live very far from you.

09:18.093 --> 09:19.102
Oh, right.

09:19.557 --> 09:20.376
Just off Bramwood.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.376
Nice.

09:26.813 --> 09:27.925
Thank you.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.096
Rose.

09:49.494 --> 09:50.331
Rose.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.574
Here we go.

10:05.117 --> 10:06.071
Where’s your paper?

10:06.934 --> 10:07.891
It’s up here.

10:10.281 --> 10:16.340
Summer. What do I know about Summer. Uhmm. Hmm.

10:18.644 --> 10:26.983
The Eiffel Tower grows six inches every year, due to the iron expanding in the heat. Uhmm.

10:29.084 --> 10:38.192
Uh, frisbees were invented in the 1800’s, it literally started as empty pie plates and they carried that on for about 60 years.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.607
Makes you wonder what other questionable things we’re doing right now.

10:44.371 --> 10:49.777
Uhmm. Ooh. It’s scientifically proven, that summer babies suffer from mood swings.

10:50.334 --> 10:51.770
Which may explain a few things.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.925
And that reminds me, none of you wished me a Happy Birthday, but I won’t hold that against you.

11:00.604 --> 11:02.946
That’s all I really have to say about summer.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.099
Okay. Anyone?

11:13.725 --> 11:14.357
Roy?

11:17.063 --> 11:22.810
That wasn’t really a poem, I mean, it was just facts laid out in different ways.

11:25.573 --> 11:26.349
Rose?

11:28.336 --> 11:30.748
Well, I don’t know how I’m supposed to debate off that.

11:31.682 --> 11:34.081
That wasn’t really a question, just words laid out in different ways.

11:36.668 --> 11:38.598
Who’s to say how a poem is defined anyway?

11:43.973 --> 11:44.918
Roy.

12:19.783 --> 12:20.548
Rose.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.088
Stay back.

12:39.162 --> 12:41.771
You have the highest test scores in your class.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.743
You may be able to get by with that in your other subjects, but not mine.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.195
If you don’t take it seriously, I’m going to have to fail you. You understand?

12:52.422 --> 12:52.856
Mhmm.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.327
You’re trying to get into Rhodes, aren’t you?

12:57.860 --> 12:58.688
Okay.

13:04.948 --> 13:06.357
What a bitch.

13:07.017 --> 13:10.740
She probably has a crush on you, I think she’s cute in a weird teacher way.

13:10.848 --> 13:11.262
Ew.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.717
That’s your pick?

13:12.717 --> 13:14.717
Hell no, Mr. Hall.

13:15.004 --> 13:16.127
Ew. Gross.

13:16.780 --> 13:20.331
Have you seen his chest, it like bulges out of his shirts.

13:20.463 --> 13:22.718
Miss Perez is sexy as hell.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.718
Oh yeah. I took ceramics because of her.

13:24.718 --> 13:26.626
Uh huh. She can work my pot any day.

13:26.626 --> 13:26.718
Yeah.
Uh huh. She can work my pot any day.

13:26.718 --> 13:26.960
Yeah.

13:27.025 --> 13:27.500
Yes, please.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
No, I’m good.

13:36.034 --> 13:41.894
Yo, uhm, could you send me like ten bucks for the beers?

13:41.899 --> 13:42.309
No.

13:42.936 --> 13:44.180
Check this out.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.924
These are good.

13:53.179 --> 13:54.305
Have you seen his ID?

13:54.860 --> 13:55.385
Let me see.

13:55.385 --> 13:57.385
It looks nothing like him.

13:57.693 --> 13:58.934
How the hell do they let that pass?

13:58.934 --> 13:59.459
Couldn’t tell you.

14:04.084 --> 14:04.490
Tyler.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.026
What was that?

14:14.666 --> 14:16.294
Is no one gonna go get it?

14:17.727 --> 14:18.896
You're just gonna watch it.

14:20.669 --> 14:25.755
Can I show you how it’s done? Watch the master.

14:27.442 --> 14:27.971
There we go.

14:32.425 --> 14:32.971
22?

14:33.654 --> 14:35.936
Yeah, 24 when you grow out your mustache.

14:36.856 --> 14:38.702
I’m gonna look so good with a mustache.

14:38.997 --> 14:39.931
Mmm, doubt it.

14:39.931 --> 14:42.970
Oh my god. I’m gonna get the little wax, do the little curly ones.

14:43.343 --> 14:46.124
The seal has broken.

14:47.034 --> 14:49.737
You guys let me walk around with lipstick on my teeth.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.122
Excuse me.

15:06.284 --> 15:08.863
It’s like so close, what is that?

15:09.327 --> 15:10.863
Alright, let me show you.

15:12.736 --> 15:13.460
Let’s bring this back.

15:17.714 --> 15:18.197
What?

15:24.783 --> 15:26.942
Well, that’s okay. I’ll just win all your games, guys.

15:29.288 --> 15:30.388
That doesn’t count either.

15:30.402 --> 15:30.952
What!

15:33.863 --> 15:35.063
Go Tyler!

15:38.376 --> 15:39.725
Don’t worry, I’ll bring it back.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.348
Blow.

15:42.398 --> 15:43.348
Blow.

15:53.771 --> 15:54.659
What do you think of her?

15:54.743 --> 15:55.450
Her?

15:56.223 --> 15:57.093
Mhmm.

15:58.077 --> 15:58.942
No.

15:58.942 --> 16:00.373
She’s cute.

16:00.496 --> 16:01.192
Right?

16:05.041 --> 16:07.533
So picky. Just too good for everyone.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.703
You skip grades in England or here?

16:13.831 --> 16:16.850
Uhm. When I took the placement tests here.

16:16.914 --> 16:18.850
Wow. That’s crazy.

16:19.703 --> 16:25.299
I guess. I always feel like I’ve learned everything I’m being taught though.

16:25.924 --> 16:30.946
Mm. I mean, that’s kind of a nice feeling, right? Knowing everything.

16:32.656 --> 16:33.936
Not really.

16:34.845 --> 16:37.478
I mean, why not? You don’t have to try as hard as we do.

16:37.528 --> 16:39.447
Yeah, but I don’t learn anything new.

16:44.693 --> 16:46.591
Tyler, your turn.

16:50.248 --> 16:51.362
Alright, let’s do this.

16:51.362 --> 16:51.411
Come on. Come on.
Alright, let’s do this.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.564
Come on. Come on.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.200
You got this.

17:02.841 --> 17:03.820
So close.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.491
Trish?

17:12.663 --> 17:13.198
Yeah.

17:14.631 --> 17:16.140
Not really my type.

17:16.481 --> 17:18.140
What is your type?

17:19.007 --> 17:20.140
I don’t know.

17:20.275 --> 17:21.620
Playing hard to get?

17:22.481 --> 17:23.256
Nope.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.724
I’m gonna get another.

17:32.242 --> 17:33.136
Cool, yeah.

17:36.457 --> 17:37.957
Yeah!

17:38.502 --> 17:39.210
We won?

17:39.777 --> 17:41.210
We won!

17:41.936 --> 17:47.004
You suck. And you suck and you suck and you suck!

20:05.001 --> 20:08.875
He always told me that I had colors seeping out of me. But, I never listened.

20:09.906 --> 20:11.438
And the hues eventually faded.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.948
Why is it that we don’t know what we have until it’s gone?

20:16.173 --> 20:21.786
Is that all apart of the lesson of life? Or is fate another fable we’re told when we’re young so our lives aren’t meaningless?

20:26.651 --> 20:35.282
If there were a destiny, she would see all of my insecurities and she would purse her lips against the indented punctures that filled my head and she would make them okay.

20:36.370 --> 20:39.300
She wouldn’t take them away, or make them beautiful.

20:40.082 --> 20:43.545
She would accept them and all of the tiny fragments that piece me together.

20:46.013 --> 20:53.717
She would turn me into art. An impression of a majestic sunset where all of my inadequacies were the colors that melded the painting together.

20:57.333 --> 20:57.893
That’s all.

20:58.949 --> 21:01.041
Okay. Good job.

21:10.017 --> 21:12.060
I’m not the biggest fan.

21:14.402 --> 21:16.005
Eleven points is eleven points.

21:16.005 --> 21:16.991
Easy.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.882
Speak for yourself.

21:18.882 --> 21:18.885
Speak for yourself.
I am.

21:18.885 --> 21:19.623
I am.

21:28.317 --> 21:32.604
Oh, look who decided to become Charlotte Bronte this week.

21:34.435 --> 21:35.754
I’m actually more of an Emily type.

21:37.056 --> 21:38.651
Like the Walmart version.

21:39.795 --> 21:43.472
You know, try not to think so hard. I can see some grays forming.

21:44.539 --> 21:46.293
At least she’s dry this time.

22:12.417 --> 22:13.737
I actually kind of liked it.

22:17.420 --> 22:17.968
Thanks.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.091
Cross in!

23:02.100 --> 23:03.555
You can’t go after him.

23:04.103 --> 23:04.565
Why?

23:05.441 --> 23:06.565
He likes Tyler.

23:06.565 --> 23:07.931
He doesn’t like her.

23:08.768 --> 23:09.349
Tyler?

23:10.254 --> 23:10.774
Hmm?

23:10.965 --> 23:11.536
Jeremy?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.146
All yours.

23:17.533 --> 23:19.973
If you can handle being second choice.

23:20.302 --> 23:21.973
Damn, it’s like that.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.945
I mean, I can live with that. Have you seen him? He’s super hot.

23:28.591 --> 23:30.120
I’m gonna rinse off, guys.

23:31.835 --> 23:35.029
I have to finish my homework, does anyone have any papers for me?

23:36.002 --> 23:37.029
I can come over.

23:37.576 --> 23:39.020
You are not copying me again.

23:39.020 --> 23:39.029
You are not copying me again.
I mean like… It’s not copying, it’s brain trust.

23:39.029 --> 23:42.222
I mean like… It’s not copying, it’s brain trust.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.084
Oh, right.

24:00.703 --> 24:01.660
What are you doing out here?

24:04.034 --> 24:05.225
Waiting to get my phone back.

24:07.976 --> 24:09.266
Were you hoping I was waiting for you?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.266
What? No.

24:21.423 --> 24:22.482
You don’t wanna be here?

24:24.712 --> 24:25.622
What makes you say that?

24:26.308 --> 24:26.964
I don’t know.

24:27.711 --> 24:28.245
Feeling?

24:29.225 --> 24:30.588
It’s not really a matter of wanting.

24:31.374 --> 24:32.432
Why not?

24:32.640 --> 24:34.001
Is school a choice in your family?

24:34.645 --> 24:35.426
That’s not what I meant.

24:36.851 --> 24:37.573
Then what do you mean?

24:39.170 --> 24:40.167
Uhh, I just…

24:41.053 --> 24:41.530
Always…

24:41.534 --> 24:42.078
You’re red.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.429
Yeah, I just got out of practice.

24:48.774 --> 24:49.391
How was it?

24:50.717 --> 24:51.207
Good.

24:53.668 --> 24:53.881
Cool.

24:55.134 --> 24:55.549
Rose.

24:56.859 --> 24:58.037
Gotta get my phone.

26:16.554 --> 26:17.291
Bye.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.000
Miss you.
I miss you.

26:20.755 --> 26:21.551
How’s school?

26:23.085 --> 26:23.924
Fine.

26:24.906 --> 26:25.881
Anything interesting?

26:26.808 --> 26:27.257
Nope.

26:28.905 --> 26:29.472
Nothing?

26:32.859 --> 26:33.668
It’s just school.

26:39.041 --> 26:39.820
How’s work?

26:41.860 --> 26:42.348
Fine.

26:43.247 --> 26:43.804
Long.

26:45.238 --> 26:47.802
They act like I have to show up to get paid. Rude.

26:53.521 --> 26:54.979
Grandma’s been asking about you.

26:57.810 --> 27:01.610
You know, school has the same policy, only there's no money involved.

27:05.194 --> 27:06.100
When do we hear?

27:08.880 --> 27:11.222
Should get the letter late Autumn.

27:12.314 --> 27:13.154
Exciting.

27:23.202 --> 27:32.397
Raven, which is never ending remembrance. Eyes meaning the essence of human identity of which you can’t separate from the human body.

27:33.248 --> 27:41.896
Watches and clocks often used symbolizing not what you think as uncertainty, but actually certainty of the inevitable.

27:43.623 --> 27:46.610
What do you know about that? What do you know about that? What do you know about that, girl?

27:47.297 --> 27:49.197
Okay long hair don’t care.

28:02.451 --> 28:04.637
Girl, what have you been doing tonight?

28:04.736 --> 28:06.637
Oh my god.

28:51.533 --> 28:51.992
Tyler.

29:08.859 --> 29:09.345
Hey.

29:10.311 --> 29:10.647
Hey.

29:11.297 --> 29:12.721
I didn't know you worked in here.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.482
I was here all the time anyway.

29:19.423 --> 29:19.709
Note?

29:20.543 --> 29:21.004
Yeah.

29:25.887 --> 29:27.699
Oh. He’s on his break right now.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.540
What? Then why did he call me in?

29:31.663 --> 29:32.299
I don’t know.

29:34.277 --> 29:34.611
Weird.

29:35.431 --> 29:35.891
Yeah.

29:38.389 --> 29:38.933
Okay.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.991
You know, I remember you.

29:56.287 --> 29:56.651
What?

29:57.368 --> 29:58.200
I remember you.

30:00.336 --> 30:00.773
Oh.

30:02.364 --> 30:03.223
From before.

30:04.881 --> 30:08.998
You were in Mrs. Bailey’s second grade class. I was in Stetson’s fourth.

30:10.444 --> 30:12.798
They used to bring our classes together for Art.

30:16.413 --> 30:17.311
You have a good memory.

30:19.045 --> 30:19.549
Yeah.

30:20.573 --> 30:21.549
I don’t remember much.

30:24.954 --> 30:25.776
You’re a senior now?

30:26.651 --> 30:27.173
Yeah.

30:28.494 --> 30:28.970
Cool.

30:34.117 --> 30:35.100
Do you feel nervous?

30:37.825 --> 30:38.460
About what?

30:39.549 --> 30:40.186
Graduating.

30:40.971 --> 30:41.518
Oh.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.158
No. Ecstatic more like.

30:44.451 --> 30:44.976
Really?

30:46.379 --> 30:47.880
Yeah, I can’t wait to get out of here.

30:48.620 --> 30:49.602
But, you just got here.

30:51.814 --> 30:54.167
So. There's a lot more to life out there.

30:55.416 --> 30:56.348
It’s just school.

30:57.158 --> 30:58.625
I mean we all have to go through it.

31:02.158 --> 31:03.260
At least we have free will?

31:03.931 --> 31:04.505
Do we?

31:05.029 --> 31:06.552
I mean, I’d like to think so.

31:08.306 --> 31:10.383
Then why do you hang out with people you don’t even like?

31:12.663 --> 31:13.300
I’ll see you around.

31:15.322 --> 31:15.705
See you.

32:23.128 --> 32:23.734
Bye.

32:35.441 --> 32:35.903
Hey.

32:37.037 --> 32:37.961
Phone taken away?

32:38.856 --> 32:40.074
No, I was waiting for you.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.031
Oh.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.724
Look I didn’t mean exactly what I said the other day.

32:47.693 --> 32:48.844
What did you mean exactly?

32:51.920 --> 32:52.571
They’re just.

32:53.241 --> 32:54.842
Not my kind of people.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.207
Just because they’re not your kind of people, doesn’t make them bad people.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.640
Okay, but you’re not that much like them.

33:04.555 --> 33:05.659
What am I like then?

33:09.687 --> 33:10.871
Smarter than you let on.

33:13.005 --> 33:13.506
Wow.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.669
No, it’s not a... I didn't mean anything by... I just meant that it…

33:21.906 --> 33:22.644
Sorry.

33:25.466 --> 33:26.358
I have to go.

33:27.837 --> 33:28.358
What can I do?

33:32.211 --> 33:32.874
I don’t know.

34:49.742 --> 34:50.334
Hey.

34:50.610 --> 34:51.142
Hi.

35:05.460 --> 35:06.223
Are your parents home?

35:06.844 --> 35:07.308
No.

35:09.484 --> 35:10.512
Are you thirsty?

35:11.197 --> 35:12.512
Oh. No, thanks.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.709
Uhm… Where are we doing it?

35:20.074 --> 35:20.600
Out here.

36:06.404 --> 36:07.281
What are you thinking about?

36:08.050 --> 36:10.143
What? Oh. Nothing really.

36:10.899 --> 36:12.143
What do you think about?

36:14.878 --> 36:18.045
Like in general? Or? What are you thinking about?

36:18.087 --> 36:19.051
No, nothing.

36:32.447 --> 36:34.084
Sometimes I don’t trust myself.

36:36.681 --> 36:37.077
Why?

36:38.542 --> 36:39.077
I don’t know.

36:41.718 --> 36:46.388
I just feel like I need a check in every now and then from someone.

36:48.757 --> 36:51.100
That what I’m looking at is actually what I’m seeing.

36:53.954 --> 36:55.768
And who usually does that?

36:57.333 --> 36:57.791
No one.

36:59.287 --> 37:02.140
So you’re just always confused?

37:02.493 --> 37:03.561
Maybe.

37:07.148 --> 37:08.260
How do you know what you want?

37:10.050 --> 37:14.936
I don’t always, but there are some things I’m certain about.

37:17.207 --> 37:18.078
And how do you know that?

37:19.866 --> 37:21.309
Just a feeling that I get.

37:23.708 --> 37:24.331
A feeling?

37:24.491 --> 37:24.960
Mhmm.

37:29.385 --> 37:30.474
What does it feel like?

37:33.385 --> 37:35.016
Like there’s no other choice.

37:36.491 --> 37:38.020
like someone’s squeezing my stomach.

37:41.380 --> 37:44.939
And other times you just don’t know?

37:46.742 --> 37:47.484
I guess.

37:49.989 --> 37:51.810
You always just know everything all the time?

37:54.161 --> 37:54.866
Pretty much.

38:03.456 --> 38:04.392
You can tell the moon is?

38:05.749 --> 38:06.426
Crescent.

38:08.420 --> 38:08.922
Crescent.

38:44.917 --> 38:45.924
Was the shading this way?

38:47.765 --> 38:48.069
Mhmm.

39:17.866 --> 39:18.680
You like Orwell?

39:19.986 --> 39:21.601
Yeah, does that surprise you?

39:23.560 --> 39:25.131
No, I don’t know.

39:32.740 --> 39:33.755
You have a brother, don’t you?

39:35.445 --> 39:36.032
How’d you know?

39:37.605 --> 39:38.518
Just a guess.

39:40.342 --> 39:41.331
You do remember.

39:44.706 --> 39:45.977
Some things.

39:46.823 --> 39:47.854
Certain smells.

39:49.204 --> 39:50.294
What does it smell like here?

39:51.724 --> 39:53.040
Kind of like summer.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.454
What does summer smell like?

39:56.700 --> 40:02.063
Uhmm. Like barbecues, the ocean.

40:07.663 --> 40:09.475
He’s in boarding school, my brother.

40:11.832 --> 40:12.608
Bad kid?

40:12.828 --> 40:14.471
No, he wanted to go.

40:16.057 --> 40:16.514
You didn’t?

40:18.462 --> 40:19.496
Seems a bit lonely.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.474
Why’d you move back?

40:25.634 --> 40:35.435
Uhm.. My grandma’s health was, well, is pretty bad. So, my mom wanted to, you know, come home.

40:35.709 --> 40:36.478
Did you want to?

40:37.256 --> 40:37.925
No.

40:39.730 --> 40:46.317
But, I mean, you know, we’re closer to going to University so, I’ll get to make my own decision eventually.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.712
What are you going to study?

40:48.722 --> 40:49.262
Writing.

40:51.219 --> 40:52.555
Maybe I’ll have your book one day.

41:01.228 --> 41:01.808
What about you?

41:04.571 --> 41:05.598
I don’t know.

41:08.591 --> 41:14.223
I’m afraid I’m going to choose the wrong thing because of job choice and be unhappy like my parents and be stuck with it.

41:14.829 --> 41:16.465
I mean, you can always change your mind.

41:17.247 --> 41:17.758
Yeah.

41:26.893 --> 41:28.357
I always thought about… No.

41:28.623 --> 41:28.983
What?

41:28.986 --> 41:29.607
I don’t know.

41:30.109 --> 41:30.934
What?

41:32.431 --> 41:32.931
Teaching.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.213
Yeah? You should do it.

41:36.638 --> 41:39.931
But the whole, presenting thing.

41:40.958 --> 41:43.897
Oh, that’s why you never read in class.

41:46.548 --> 41:49.082
I threw up. Sophomore year.

41:49.951 --> 41:55.000
Some nerve thing. I just hand my poems in now.

41:55.696 --> 41:57.000
I wouldn’t expect you to do that.

41:59.727 --> 42:05.644
You seem like someone who would, you know, perform well under pressure. You always know the right thing to say at school.

42:08.324 --> 42:11.114
You believe that? That people are only one certain way?

42:13.288 --> 42:13.894
Sometimes.

42:20.140 --> 42:21.047
Where’s your bathroom?

42:21.557 --> 42:22.736
First door on the left.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.491
I have to get home for dinner.

42:57.509 --> 42:57.982
Okay.

43:12.870 --> 43:13.506
Bye.

43:15.223 --> 43:16.718
You’re not going to walk me out?

43:17.491 --> 43:19.924
Why? Are you going to steal something on the way down?

43:20.924 --> 43:23.488
I mean, I was thinking about it, but now, I guess not.

44:16.183 --> 44:17.131
What are you smirking about?

44:19.242 --> 44:20.825
Just above average day.

44:22.017 --> 44:24.019
Yeah? What made it above average?

44:25.927 --> 44:26.982
I didn’t want to strangle anyone.

44:29.045 --> 44:29.946
Okay, fair enough.

48:04.134 --> 48:04.577
Bathroom?

48:49.185 --> 48:49.540
Hey.

48:51.274 --> 48:51.853
Hi.

48:54.004 --> 48:54.460
Note?

48:55.480 --> 48:55.917
No.

48:59.117 --> 49:00.420
You left your book at my place.

49:01.186 --> 49:02.737
Oh, yeah, I thought you’d like it.

49:03.174 --> 49:04.314
But you didn’t tell me to read it.

49:04.798 --> 49:08.625
Well, I thought you’d figure that out. Seems like you did.

49:09.260 --> 49:09.791
Yeah.

49:10.731 --> 49:11.367
I like it.

49:12.665 --> 49:13.254
Thought you would.

49:14.942 --> 49:15.911
Did I already say that?

49:16.791 --> 49:17.125
Yeah.

49:23.312 --> 49:24.800
My dad gave me that book when I was eight.

49:25.480 --> 49:26.084
That book?

49:27.204 --> 49:28.080
Did you understand it?

49:28.866 --> 49:29.549
Not at all.

49:35.936 --> 49:37.125
Are you going to English today?

49:39.362 --> 49:40.444
I haven’t decided yet.

51:10.841 --> 51:12.733
He’s been after Michele for at least a couple of years.

51:14.402 --> 51:14.779
Jay?

51:15.653 --> 51:18.602
You haven’t noticed when she’s around? He follows her around like a puppy.

51:19.037 --> 51:23.096
No, he’s not into all that traditional shit. She’s someone that fantasizes about going to the prom.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.189
You sound jealous.

51:25.537 --> 51:27.060
You do. You like Jay?

51:27.337 --> 51:31.530
What the hell, no. Where were you after school? We waited for you.

51:32.699 --> 51:33.779
Went to a Volleyball game.

51:34.819 --> 51:36.198
She went to go check out the girls.

51:36.777 --> 51:38.205
You into organized sports now?

51:38.328 --> 51:42.254
No, I just went because Miss Gerwin said she’d give me extra credit, okay? Calm down.

51:42.900 --> 51:43.939
Alright, whatever you say.

51:44.051 --> 51:46.767
I bet you she’s into some really weird shit. She just won’t admit it.

52:18.134 --> 52:18.905
Do you want me to check it?

52:20.453 --> 52:21.263
No, it’s okay.

53:17.188 --> 53:18.149
Which did you like?

53:20.942 --> 53:21.934
Uhm…

53:23.250 --> 53:25.235
I like the first one.

53:26.053 --> 53:26.462
Why?

53:29.054 --> 53:29.560
Why what?

53:29.970 --> 53:31.280
Why did you like the first one?

53:32.841 --> 53:33.444
I don’t know.

53:37.062 --> 53:40.211
There has to be a reason. Don’t you have one for everything?

53:43.702 --> 53:45.358
I guess I like the pattern.

53:46.165 --> 53:47.028
Stripes?

53:47.305 --> 53:47.777
Mhmm.

53:49.884 --> 53:51.016
Will you please come?

53:52.917 --> 53:53.777
I can’t.

53:54.128 --> 53:59.278
Mm… I heard you on the phone, you’re meeting up with Attwell. You were in the room, you know?

54:01.315 --> 54:02.730
I won’t know anyone.

54:05.730 --> 54:12.240
You’re a bit frustrating. You’re not exactly a wallflower. Besides, you can bring him.

54:13.699 --> 54:14.447
And you'll know me.

54:19.736 --> 54:22.954
I just… I’m not that comfortable.

54:24.783 --> 54:25.434
I understand.

54:43.343 --> 54:43.831
Hey.

54:45.385 --> 54:45.708
Hi.

54:48.840 --> 54:49.400
Do you need help?

54:53.682 --> 54:54.284
What is that?

54:55.074 --> 54:55.857
Tequila?

54:57.214 --> 54:57.905
Great.

54:59.967 --> 55:00.481
Full.

55:02.428 --> 55:03.085
Full send.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.780
I like it. Yeah.

55:16.143 --> 55:16.637
Yeah?

55:16.877 --> 55:17.419
Yeah.

55:30.875 --> 55:32.034
She’s your moms age.

55:32.922 --> 55:34.010
That doesn’t make her less hot.

55:40.703 --> 55:51.280
But imagine if you could like somehow communicate with people without telling them what you’re actually feeling. You know what I mean? Like, it never comes out the way it is in your head anyway.

55:53.082 --> 55:57.902
But then you wouldn’t be able to hide anything and everything would be all exposed all the time.

55:58.422 --> 56:02.604
Yeah, but, you’d just cut through all the unnecessary bullshit quicker.

56:03.580 --> 56:08.225
But, come on, not everything you think you want to come true. Literally, it would be the worst.

56:11.511 --> 56:12.032
Maybe.

56:12.928 --> 56:13.724
It would be terrible.

56:23.441 --> 56:24.201
It’s really good.

56:24.659 --> 56:25.804
It’s great, right?

56:27.373 --> 56:28.795
Come on, dance. Dance with me.

56:47.205 --> 56:49.038
Come on, you know you want to dance. Come on.

57:04.016 --> 57:04.620
Hey Tyler.

57:06.675 --> 57:08.834
You’re pretty decent at flip cup.

57:10.908 --> 57:11.777
Where you going?

58:45.954 --> 58:46.582
I gotta go.

58:47.328 --> 58:48.082
What? We just got here.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.223
Yeah, well, my mom needs help with something.

58:51.964 --> 58:53.120
Come on, I’ll drop you off at home.

1:00:10.681 --> 1:00:12.768
You know, you're a surprisingly good drunk texter.

1:00:13.881 --> 1:00:14.960
Don’t look at me.

1:00:16.650 --> 1:00:18.782
Who said I was looking at you? I was talking to the guy over there.

1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:24.605
I can’t see.

1:00:25.417 --> 1:00:26.536
Well, that’s not good.

1:00:26.669 --> 1:00:29.158
I mean, I can see, but only out of this eye.

1:00:30.094 --> 1:00:31.789
Okay, can you stand?

1:00:32.260 --> 1:00:33.789
Well, I think I can manage.

1:00:35.638 --> 1:00:36.579
You okay?

1:01:15.962 --> 1:01:17.980
Shoot. I’m sorry.

1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:19.893
No, it’s fine. No one’s home.

1:01:55.788 --> 1:01:56.345
Tyler?

1:01:56.983 --> 1:01:57.340
Hmm?

1:01:59.971 --> 1:02:02.342
Why don’t you get with Sarah or Trish or someone?

1:02:03.167 --> 1:02:03.644
What?

1:02:06.709 --> 1:02:08.595
There are so many pretty girls at school.

1:02:09.108 --> 1:02:10.065
And out of it.

1:02:11.404 --> 1:02:12.128
And out of it.

1:02:13.539 --> 1:02:15.565
Do you not see yourself when you look in the mirror?

1:04:07.405 --> 1:04:08.850
Are you wearing my clothes?

1:06:14.782 --> 1:06:17.139
Shit. I have practice.

1:06:27.081 --> 1:06:27.611
Okay.

1:06:40.293 --> 1:06:41.078
Hey.

1:06:41.539 --> 1:06:41.890
Hi.

1:06:42.862 --> 1:06:44.182
This is my friend Tyler from school.

1:06:44.192 --> 1:06:46.536
Hi. Tyler Westley.

1:06:47.438 --> 1:06:48.016
Yeah.

1:06:48.899 --> 1:06:50.794
I knew your mom, my High School days.

1:06:50.877 --> 1:06:51.841
You went to school with her?

1:06:52.222 --> 1:06:52.838
I did.

1:06:53.677 --> 1:06:54.844
Is she still perfect?

1:06:55.546 --> 1:06:56.213
Pretty much.

1:06:56.998 --> 1:07:00.105
Yeah, well, we were all just trying to catch up with her. How is she?

1:07:00.475 --> 1:07:01.395
Yeah, fine.

1:07:01.940 --> 1:07:02.705
Tell her I said Hi.

1:07:02.762 --> 1:07:04.466
I will. Sorry I have to run.

1:07:04.786 --> 1:07:05.675
Tell her I said Hi!

1:07:05.703 --> 1:07:06.940
Okay, will do. Bye.

1:07:07.032 --> 1:07:07.939
Bye, nice to see you.

1:07:07.943 --> 1:07:08.508
Nice meeting you!

1:07:11.537 --> 1:07:13.155
She was just borrowing a book for class.

1:07:13.737 --> 1:07:14.456
I didn’t say anything.

1:07:14.681 --> 1:07:15.893
Why are you being weird?

1:07:15.942 --> 1:07:17.109
I’m not.

1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:19.638
How was work?

1:07:19.745 --> 1:07:21.620
Fine. What day is it again?

1:07:30.638 --> 1:07:31.385
Tyler!

1:07:38.333 --> 1:07:38.767
Hi.

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:41.847
When did you get home?

1:07:41.976 --> 1:07:43.142
This morning. Where were you?

1:07:44.016 --> 1:07:45.013
Practice.

1:07:46.737 --> 1:07:47.357
How was it?

1:07:48.158 --> 1:07:50.349
It was work. Did you hear back from any schools?

1:07:51.247 --> 1:07:51.869
Not yet.

1:07:53.308 --> 1:07:55.462
Well, early admissions should be out by now.

1:07:57.130 --> 1:07:57.666
Yeah.

1:08:06.007 --> 1:08:08.133
I’ve been thinking about changing my major.

1:08:13.592 --> 1:08:14.131
To what?

1:08:14.974 --> 1:08:15.640
I don’t know.

1:08:17.327 --> 1:08:19.062
Education or something.

1:08:21.711 --> 1:08:22.724
That’s a joke, right?

1:08:23.945 --> 1:08:30.002
No, I’m good with numbers but, I don’t know if I see myself doing it for a career.

1:08:32.591 --> 1:08:34.262
But you think you could teach somebody?

1:08:35.162 --> 1:08:35.678
I don’t know.

1:08:36.063 --> 1:08:39.402
Tyler, you could barely present your show and tell in front of the class.

1:08:39.674 --> 1:08:39.974
Yeah.

1:08:42.472 --> 1:08:43.165
I have homework.

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:46.346
Just go.

1:10:42.776 --> 1:10:44.152
Did you do this a lot back home?

1:10:45.718 --> 1:10:47.271
Well, I didn’t have a truck so…

1:10:48.056 --> 1:10:48.762
Funny.

1:11:00.702 --> 1:11:05.010
I don’t know what you’re doing with me. The way some people look at you.

1:11:05.481 --> 1:11:07.542
No, I don’t know about that.

1:11:11.321 --> 1:11:12.921
You know the dance is coming up?

1:11:13.971 --> 1:11:14.561
Yeah.

1:11:14.943 --> 1:11:17.828
And what are your thoughts on those kinds of things?

1:11:20.118 --> 1:11:22.432
Not really my kind of thing.

1:11:22.472 --> 1:11:24.647
Yeah, you’re probably too cool.

1:11:25.622 --> 1:11:26.795
Or not cool enough.

1:11:27.764 --> 1:11:30.254
I don’t know what view you have of yourself sometimes.

1:11:31.722 --> 1:11:32.801
I think you should come.

1:11:33.447 --> 1:11:33.868
Do you?

1:11:34.813 --> 1:11:35.595
Definitely.

1:11:41.705 --> 1:11:42.197
Okay.

1:11:43.724 --> 1:11:44.275
Really?

1:11:44.425 --> 1:11:44.848
Really?

1:11:45.709 --> 1:11:46.848
Yeah.

1:11:46.848 --> 1:11:48.848
Really.

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:51.856
Really?

1:11:52.395 --> 1:11:53.237
Really, really, really.

1:12:44.813 --> 1:12:46.360
When do I get to meet your friends?

1:12:47.284 --> 1:12:49.616
You’ve met them. Same school.

1:12:49.629 --> 1:12:50.342
Properly.

1:12:54.063 --> 1:12:56.247
Okay. If you really want to meet mine first.

1:12:58.197 --> 1:12:59.041
I think we’re good.

1:13:09.548 --> 1:13:10.325
Is this gross?

1:13:27.309 --> 1:13:30.967
I was like what? She said you should do that. You should do that.

1:13:33.871 --> 1:13:35.282
They’ll just be like staring at things.

1:13:35.765 --> 1:13:38.733
Are you doing one of your little potions?

1:13:38.779 --> 1:13:39.856
Yeah, this is my potion.

1:14:06.450 --> 1:14:10.121
Tyler?

1:14:10.752 --> 1:14:11.708
She wouldn’t go there.

1:14:12.484 --> 1:14:16.675
I promise you. Kate said she saw them leaving the party together.

1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:19.250
Can I use some of that?

1:14:19.702 --> 1:14:20.208
Yeah.

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:24.271
Maybe they’re just friends.

1:14:25.368 --> 1:14:27.580
Or maybe they’re fucking.

1:14:30.112 --> 1:14:34.671
I don’t know. You know how picky she is, you know, she has standards.

1:14:35.499 --> 1:14:39.884
True. I heard she was in rehab when she was like eleven.

1:14:41.170 --> 1:14:46.325
Probably, you know? Well, she’ll probably end up like her dad.

1:14:47.149 --> 1:14:48.158
That’s messed up.

1:14:50.768 --> 1:14:51.736
Well, it’s true.

1:14:54.419 --> 1:14:55.028
Wow.

1:14:58.028 --> 1:15:00.665
Done with that? You going to make out with it all day?

1:15:01.192 --> 1:15:04.281
Come on, guys. Lets get out of here.

1:16:13.703 --> 1:16:14.145
Hey.

1:16:15.734 --> 1:16:16.148
Hey.

1:16:16.665 --> 1:16:17.594
I haven’t heard from you.

1:16:18.872 --> 1:16:20.413
There’s a crazy amount of absences.

1:16:22.459 --> 1:16:23.407
I’ll see you after school?

1:16:24.933 --> 1:16:26.696
I already told Attwell I’d go to his house.

1:16:27.537 --> 1:16:28.168
Okay.

1:16:31.358 --> 1:16:32.379
You sure you’re okay?

1:16:43.262 --> 1:16:44.435
I can’t go to the dance with you.

1:16:46.494 --> 1:16:46.967
Why not?

1:16:49.995 --> 1:16:50.545
I just can’t.

1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:53.650
It’s tomorrow.

1:16:54.782 --> 1:16:57.442
Yeah. You should go with someone else.

1:17:01.934 --> 1:17:02.854
Why are you saying that?

1:17:04.410 --> 1:17:06.014
It’s not that serious, okay?

1:17:38.057 --> 1:17:39.417
Trish! Hey!

1:17:39.731 --> 1:17:41.182
Hey. Good practice.

1:17:41.368 --> 1:17:41.962
You too.

1:17:42.891 --> 1:17:45.491
What- Are you going to the dance?

1:17:46.377 --> 1:17:48.508
Uh, yeah. With friends.

1:17:49.454 --> 1:17:51.148
Would you maybe want to go together?

1:17:53.397 --> 1:17:55.450
Yeah. Definitely.

1:17:55.906 --> 1:17:56.447
Cool.

1:17:56.970 --> 1:17:57.420
Cool.

1:17:58.271 --> 1:17:58.974
I’ll see you tomorrow.

1:17:58.988 --> 1:17:59.908
Yeah, okay.

1:18:00.851 --> 1:18:01.244
Bye.

1:18:25.751 --> 1:18:29.908
It’s going to be quiet enough when you’re in college, huh? Humor me.

1:18:31.331 --> 1:18:32.321
I don’t have anything.

1:18:34.071 --> 1:18:34.903
I don’t believe that.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:37.586
Work that boring?

1:18:38.974 --> 1:18:43.222
And monotonous and tedious. You want me to keep going?

1:18:44.226 --> 1:18:44.859
If you want to.

1:18:50.299 --> 1:18:51.226
I passed English Lit.

1:18:53.798 --> 1:18:55.518
Oh, I didn’t know there was a chance that you wouldn’t.

1:18:57.197 --> 1:18:58.368
Just didn’t really care enough.

1:19:01.484 --> 1:19:03.197
You know, it’s nice to care sometimes.

1:19:07.779 --> 1:19:09.197
I guess I could tell myself that.

1:19:12.728 --> 1:19:15.951
One day you’ll look back at this time and wish it lasted forever.

1:19:19.173 --> 1:19:20.133
I don’t think so.

1:19:34.542 --> 1:19:51.108
Hi, darling. It’s me, your dad. I’m just calling to see how your first day back at school went, I bet it was brilliant. Anyway, I hope to see you soon. Well, whenever they let me out of here. So, yeah, take care now. Love you. Bye.

1:20:54.228 --> 1:20:55.157
I lapped you again.

1:20:56.241 --> 1:20:56.724
Well.

1:21:08.414 --> 1:21:09.328
She’s at the dance.

1:21:11.845 --> 1:21:12.764
Who?

1:21:13.650 --> 1:21:14.835
Really, you think we didn’t know?

1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:23.241
She went with Trish.

1:22:33.205 --> 1:22:34.743
I had a really good time tonight.

1:22:35.831 --> 1:22:36.376
Me too.

1:22:41.019 --> 1:22:42.680
I really hope it works out for you guys.

1:22:43.869 --> 1:22:44.192
Thanks.

1:22:45.093 --> 1:22:45.546
Yeah.

1:22:48.102 --> 1:22:48.857
Okay. Bye.

1:22:50.125 --> 1:22:50.589
Bye.

1:23:42.688 --> 1:23:44.574
She is much like a flower.

1:23:46.373 --> 1:23:48.814
Delicate and beautiful.

1:23:50.183 --> 1:23:52.480
Yet strong and steady.

1:23:55.629 --> 1:23:59.675
And just like a flower, without any sun.

1:24:02.668 --> 1:24:04.121
She cannot flourish.

1:24:22.130 --> 1:24:23.066
I liked your poem.

1:24:24.891 --> 1:24:25.345
Thanks.

1:24:33.069 --> 1:24:34.038
Are you free tonight?

1:24:36.395 --> 1:24:37.010
Why?

1:24:39.300 --> 1:24:40.333
I want to show you something.

1:25:36.259 --> 1:25:37.094
What is this?

1:25:37.161 --> 1:25:37.902
Light it up.

1:25:44.831 --> 1:25:46.296
Would you want to dance with me?
