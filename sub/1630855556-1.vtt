[exhales sharply]

00:13.446 --> 00:15.081
Okay.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.282
[exhales sharply]

00:17.817 --> 00:21.588
I can't imagine spending
my life with anyone else.

00:22.922 --> 00:27.394
You are the most beautiful,
sweet, kind-hearted person

00:27.427 --> 00:31.598
I've ever met, and you make me
happier than I have ever been.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.734
If you give me the chance,
I would love to spend

00:34.768 --> 00:38.905
the rest of my life trying to
make you feel the same way.

00:38.938 --> 00:41.574
Will... you marry me?

00:43.943 --> 00:46.279
Oh, you're done?

00:46.312 --> 00:48.415
-Yep.
-No, it was good. It was good.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.250
-A little generic, but good.
-Generic?

00:50.283 --> 00:51.651
Come on, that was
some top-tier shit.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.253
It was shit,
I'm not arguing that.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.155
Okay, and I'm going
to beat you to death.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.656
Even your death threats
have gotten generic.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.625
I'm not done yet, I'm gonna
kill you, chop you up

00:58.658 --> 01:00.527
in little pieces and
throw you in a river.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.395
Well, if it were me,
I would grind up your guts,

01:02.429 --> 01:03.963
turn you into an aged
sausage, then feed you

01:04.064 --> 01:05.298
to people I don't like
at dinner parties.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.167
Two birds, one stone,
I like that.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.935
-Thank you.
-I would-I would bleed you out.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.503
And use your skin as a coat.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.938
Oh, that doesn't
sound very warm.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.207
-On a fall day with a cardigan?
-See, that's poetic.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.642
Why don't you use that
in your proposal?

01:15.675 --> 01:17.243
No, no, Taylor, I don't
think she'll go for that.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.745
Well, if she doesn't
respond favorably

01:18.778 --> 01:20.647
to the idea of you wearing her
skin on a fall day,

01:20.680 --> 01:22.148
then I don't think
she's the girl for you.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.483
She is, and you're gonna
meet her.

01:23.516 --> 01:24.651
-And you're gonna love her.
- Mm, yeah.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.186
I don't know about that.
You haven't had

01:26.219 --> 01:27.654
great taste in women
since college.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.656
Plus, if she's so great,
then why have you been

01:29.689 --> 01:31.658
hiding her from me for the last
two times I've been out here?

01:31.691 --> 01:33.159
I didn't want you to
scare her away.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.195
[both laugh sarcastically]

01:35.228 --> 01:37.163
Oh, by the way, I know
you like to snoop around,

01:37.197 --> 01:39.432
I put all the good stuff
in the top sock drawer.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.301
Thank you.
Are you sure it's cool

01:41.334 --> 01:42.969
if I crash with you for so long?

01:43.003 --> 01:44.537
I can always get an Airbnb.

01:44.571 --> 01:45.972
Uh, I can't really
afford that, but...

01:46.006 --> 01:49.309
Stop. You're always welcome,
okay? Breakup or not.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.811
-Thank you. I appreciate it.
-[Peter] Of course, dude.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.848
Now, get out of my car.
I have to go.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.649
-Okay.
-Oh, by the way.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.184
Do you mind showering
before dinner

01:58.218 --> 01:59.953
because you kinda smell
like an airplane toilet.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.788
Thank you for noticing.
You know, this car makes you

02:01.821 --> 02:03.323
look like a child molester,
in case you're wondering

02:03.356 --> 02:04.524
why the cops are knocking
at your door.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.359
-Okay.
-Awesome. Have a great day.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.863
-Thank you do much. You too.
-Yep, have a good day at work.

02:09.896 --> 02:13.767
-Thank you. Oh, your key.
-Oh, God, thanks.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.571
-Bye, honey! Bye, sweetheart!
-Okay, bye! Bye, honey!

04:23.463 --> 04:25.398
-Hey!
-Oh, hi!

04:27.133 --> 04:28.968
Funny seeing you here.

04:29.069 --> 04:32.405
Actually, that's perfect because
I came back up to give you this.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.907
You left it at my place
last night.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.142
-What would I do without you?
-Get fired, I think.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.844
-I can adapt.
-You're too old to adapt.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.313
-That's true.
-Yeah, okay. I am late.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.781
And my Stevens meeting
got moved uptown,

04:41.815 --> 04:43.350
so I won't have time to
get the dry cleaning.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.152

-What would you do without me?
-See you tonight?

04:55.328 --> 04:58.298

05:12.579 --> 05:14.114
Okay. I'm buying a pretzel.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.615
Hey, we're about to eat dinner.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.183
You keep saying that
and I'm still starving.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.485
I told you not to smoke
all of that.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.686
You also said this bitch was

05:19.719 --> 05:21.187
going to be here
twenty minutes ago.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.056
Hey, you need to chill.
Taylor has a thing about pot,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.791
and I want her to like you,
so please just...

05:24.824 --> 05:26.559
-Here she comes. Here she comes.
-[Taylor] Hi!

05:26.593 --> 05:29.062
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My, my cab driver hit a pigeon

05:29.095 --> 05:31.064
and he was inconsolable,
and I felt terrible

05:31.097 --> 05:32.632
leaving him and it
was this whole thing.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.967
Ah! Hey!

05:34.067 --> 05:36.102
Do you think that pigeon's
up for grabs?

05:36.136 --> 05:39.939
Uh, Taylor, Lexa. Lexa, Taylor.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.510
-You're Lexa?
-Yes. Right? Yeah.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.879
-Nice to meet you.
-Okay, let's eat.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.682
Uh, yeah, yeah, we know a great
Italian bistro a few blocks out.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.885
-What about this place?
-My place has great focaccia.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.687
This place has a buffet.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.422
Oh, it also has
a, a D health rating.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.757
I've never even seen
a D before. [chuckles]

05:57.791 --> 05:59.459
Don't.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.927
Well, did you know that
there's enough alcohol

06:01.027 --> 06:02.629
in one cocktail to kill
most food-borne illnesses?

06:02.662 --> 06:04.464
That doesn't sound
like science.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.033
Come on. Hole In The Walls
have the best food.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.336
Back me up on this,
Pistol Pete.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.941
-Okay, smell it.
-Yes, it's got nectar in it.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.576
[Taylor giggling]

06:16.609 --> 06:18.778
Passion fruit and nectar.
Do you smell it?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.780
Yeah, but I also got
my lipstick on you.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.749
-You guys are cute.
-Oh, thank you.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.785
It's really sweet.
Uh, so what about you?

06:25.819 --> 06:28.254
Peter tells me that you were
dating someone back in New York.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.257
Luke. Yeah, I was. Past tense.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.492
-Oh!
-[Lexa] No, it's fine.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.660
I broke up with him actually.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.295
Um, he had these
really big teeth.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.063
It was like making out
with a Steinway.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.065
I used to be like that, I used
to end things with guys

06:39.065 --> 06:41.167
over the littlest things,
like they're going bald,

06:41.201 --> 06:43.870
or they like ironic mugs,
or they have two first names.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.673
And then she found me,
the perfect male specimen.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.743
No. I, um, realized
I didn't want to be alone.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.811
Ah, see, I just love
the idea of ending up alone.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.546
Wait. You're saying
you settled?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.814
No, bear, I didn't
mean it like that.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.416
Kinda sounded like it,
but it's okay,

06:56.449 --> 06:58.084
you're way out of my league,
it's all good.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.021
So, so what about now? A-are you
trying to get back out there?

07:01.021 --> 07:03.857
No, no, no, no, not quite.
Um, I'm just focusing on

07:03.890 --> 07:05.225
launching this app
I've been designing.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.659
Yeah. It's great. I can't

07:06.693 --> 07:08.294
believe no one's thought
about this, tell her.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.330
-No, it's not a big deal.
-[Peter] Dude, come on.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.033
Okay, um, so, it's helps you
find the closest dive bar.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.868
So you know, like, when
you're out with your friends

07:14.901 --> 07:16.703
and you're like,
"Oh, we don't wanna go home,

07:16.736 --> 07:18.905
but where do we go?"
That's where my app comes in.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.041
Oh, isn't that a feature
on Google Maps?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.910
Yeah, but mine has, um,
pictures and reviews.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.845
Oh, Yelp?

07:25.879 --> 07:29.049
It-it might not work,
but, um...

07:29.049 --> 07:31.685
Honestly, I'm just trying
to finish something for once.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.852
I have this really
bad habit of starting

07:32.886 --> 07:34.287
things and then dropping them.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.056
Ugh! I'm like that
with knitting.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.691
You know, I can't tell you
the number of sweaters

07:37.724 --> 07:39.159
that end up as scarves.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.061
Are you guys ready to order
or do you need a minute?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.462
Thank God!
No, no, no, I'm ready.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.065
I'm gonna do
the-the, the spaghetti,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.734
and the chicken marsala,
and the bruschetta.

07:47.767 --> 07:48.902
Um, and more of this bread.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.970
-Please.
-Oh, wow! [chuckles]

07:51.071 --> 07:52.839
-Woof!
-Thanks.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.475
[Taylor] Uh, yeah, we're gonna
share the Caesar salad,

07:55.508 --> 07:58.545
and then, uh, the-the veal
par-ma-ji-yana.

07:58.578 --> 07:59.546
[Lexa] Peter doesn't eat veal.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.514
-Yeah, I do.
-He does.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.817
What? Don't you remember that
video that we watched in college

08:03.850 --> 08:05.685
about veal farming,
you had a panic attack.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.053
You joined the
animal rights club.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.222
-No, I didn't.
-You were dating that girl Pond.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.257
-Her name was Lake.
-You ate hemp meat.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.460
That was, like, no,
that was a long time ago.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.929
Yeah. You went through a really
long phase with the hemp meat.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.398
-Long time ago.
-It was a long time ago.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.600
-No...
-Long time ago--

08:20.633 --> 08:22.602
All right, sorry.
The-the first time I-I

08:22.635 --> 08:24.037
cooked for you,
I made veal meatballs.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.106
Yeah, that was..
They were-they were delicious.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.042
You cried. You cried
and you said that it was,

08:29.075 --> 08:30.744
um, because you were
in love with me.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.346
-It was mostly because of that.
-Because of the veal?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.081
It was not because of the veal.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.917
Honey, those cows are put in
little tiny cages with no light.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.719
Peter, it's not about the cows.
You lied to me.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.254
I know. I love you.
I'm sorry I lied

08:41.287 --> 08:42.922
'cause I love you, I didn't
wanna hurt your feelings.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.392
I've made you veal like
a hundred times since then.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.060
I know.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.161
[laughing]

08:50.163 --> 08:53.199
-Are you laughing at me?
-No, I'm laughing at him.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.534
Um, that's so, like, Peter to

08:54.567 --> 08:55.969
reinvent himself for the
girlfriend of the week.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.837
Wow!

08:57.871 --> 08:59.639
She's not the girlfriend
of the week, Lexa. Come on.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.408
Oh, no. Sorry.
I didn't mean it like...

09:01.441 --> 09:02.742
-It's fine.
-[Lexa] No, seriously.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.344
Don't be mad at him.
Don't be mad at him.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.845
He's perfect. Be mad at me.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.782
-I'm the idiot. I'm stoned.
-Oh.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.117
-She's not stoned. No, you're...
-Yes, I am.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.919
Remember you gave me that
dry bag of weed?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.154
Not stoned, you're not stoned.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.789
[laughing]

09:15.822 --> 09:19.426
-Yeah, it's just really funny.
-No, I'm sorry.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.428
-Honey.
-I had a cough and itching.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.164
No, no, hold me hand.
Hold me hand. Hold me hand.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.466
I'm from Ireland.
Come on, hold my hand.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.703
[keyboard keys clacking]

09:33.440 --> 09:34.741
Lexa's great.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.509
I didn't realize you guys
were so close.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.247
Are we having a fight?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.616
[Taylor] I don't know.
Should we be having a fight?

09:43.650 --> 09:45.118
-Well, about what?
-[Taylor] I don't know.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.653
You tell me.
What are we fighting about?

09:46.686 --> 09:48.321
-Nothing?
-[Taylor] Okay.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.456
Then we're not fighting.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.058
[police siren wailing]

09:52.058 --> 09:57.497
Okay. I'm sorry that I lied
about the veal thing.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.366
I know.
But you don't lie to her.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.868
Well, it's because it's
impossible to hurt her feelings.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.069
Her heart is buried behind

10:03.103 --> 10:05.038
a Shawshank level
security system.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.374
He famously escapes
in that movie.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.842
I'm sorry that I lied. I just,

10:08.875 --> 10:10.343
I hate being the person
to hurt your feelings.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.645
I get why you did it. I just...

10:12.679 --> 10:15.148
I'd rather you be honest
than spare my feelings.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.852
-I'm sorry. I won't lie anymore.
-There's a window of amnesty.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.720
Wanna get anything
off your chest?

10:20.754 --> 10:23.490
-I hate your mom.
-Are you serious?

10:23.523 --> 10:26.192
I have said that she's been a
nightmare for years and years,

10:26.226 --> 10:28.528
and you always defend her.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.063
-That's really weird.
-I know. I mean...

10:30.096 --> 10:31.931
If she had a really hard
childhood, I would understand--

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
No, she doesn't.
There's like no reason.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.635
She didn't come from a broken
home. She doesn't have

10:35.669 --> 10:37.504
a weird uncle,
she just hates waiters

10:37.537 --> 10:41.107
and puppies
and Keanu Reeves which is...

10:41.141 --> 10:43.109
-I love Keanu Reeves.
-I know you do.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.645
-You really love Keanu Reeves.
-Yeah, I love Keanu Reeves.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.514
Yeah. [laughing]

10:47.547 --> 10:50.183
-Whoa! Sheryl doesn't.
-Yeah.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.719
Yeah, she thinks
he's <i>too</i>good-looking,

10:52.752 --> 10:54.054
which is like, "What, why?"

10:54.087 --> 10:56.222
I can't unpack your
mom's sexual repression.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.525
-That's a bridge too far.
-I know.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.760
-Yeah.
-Anything else?

11:00.794 --> 11:02.562
-No.
-Because the window's closing.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.130
-That's all I got.
-Okay.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.067
-That's it? Love you.
-I love you.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.672
Wait, wait, wait, I actually
can't have sex with you

11:12.706 --> 11:13.973
'cause I'm thinking
about your mom now.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.175
That's weird. I'm thinking
about your dad.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.509
But I'm, like,
I'm kinda into it.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.544
-Okay. Wait.
-Okay.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.546
-Okay. Wait. All right.
-Okay.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.780
[Taylor chuckles]

11:23.350 --> 11:24.551
You're kidding now, right?
About my dad.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.086
[Taylor] No.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.120
[Peter snoring]

11:42.235 --> 11:43.203
[sighs]

11:44.337 --> 11:45.839
[continues snoring]

11:53.813 --> 11:54.981
Want to watch something?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.785
I'm working
and not talking to you

11:58.818 --> 12:00.787
because you were such
a dick at dinner.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.555
Seriously?

12:02.589 --> 12:05.325
You called my girlfriend,
who I'm proposing to,

12:05.358 --> 12:07.127
a girl of the week,
like, really?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.829
Not my finest moment, I'll admit
to that. I'm sorry, really.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.464
You need to apologize
to her tomorrow.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.233
Done. Totally. Got it.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.837
-Dick.
-You love me.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.272
Both can be true.
You're like my annoying

12:19.305 --> 12:21.074
Chihuahua that pees on the rug
and eats my socks.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.078
Well, I also fit in the purse
and love Taco Bell. Arf!

12:25.812 --> 12:26.813
[mimicking puppy]

12:26.846 --> 12:29.616
[mimicking cats]

12:29.649 --> 12:30.984
What's on?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.119
E! network's movies
be all about love.

12:35.121 --> 12:35.922
Sweet!

12:35.955 --> 12:39.092
[song in foreign language]

12:56.276 --> 12:59.145
[music on TV]

12:59.679 --> 13:00.814
[door opens]

13:00.847 --> 13:02.048
[footsteps approaching]

13:10.857 --> 13:12.659
[Taylor sighs]

13:12.692 --> 13:14.060
[dishes clattering]

13:15.929 --> 13:18.098
Oh, sorry, did I wake you?

13:18.131 --> 13:23.236
I'm late. I'm late. I'm late!
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.271
-You okay?
-Son of a mother!

13:30.176 --> 13:33.513
-Morning! Yeah, there you go.
-Hi, there!

13:35.515 --> 13:37.083
You look like you just
dropped out of an ad

13:37.083 --> 13:40.320
for a well-balanced breakfast.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.356
I mean, thank you.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.657
[Lexa chuckles]

13:44.691 --> 13:46.793
Hey, sorry about dinner
last night.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
Yeah, you know,
Peter's talked about you

13:48.695 --> 13:51.564
since we started dating,
you're just not what I expected.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.899
It's hard to capture

13:52.932 --> 13:54.467
the magnitude of my greatness
in words.

13:54.501 --> 13:58.204
Yeah, exactly. Don't get me
wrong, he sang your praises.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.708
Talked about how funny
and smart you are.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.410
What's happening?
Are you trying to smash?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.845
[slurp]

14:05.879 --> 14:09.082
No, no. I'm just trying to
understand

14:09.115 --> 14:11.217
why the two of you
never got together.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.554
-Me and Peter? No. Never.
-Mm-hmm.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.189
I mean, maybe if the
circumstances were different,

14:16.222 --> 14:18.692
but... no, the timing was
never right.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.194
So it was just the,
the timing that stopped you two?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.131
You're asking
an impossible question.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.766
Well, haven't you ever
wondered, like...

14:26.800 --> 14:28.068
[chuckles]

14:28.068 --> 14:29.969
I wonder about all
my life choices.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.671
You're avoiding the question.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.541
-It's an insane question.
-Maybe.

14:37.243 --> 14:41.348
Well, um,
this was helpful. Thank you.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.749
You're welcome.
Thank you for this.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.317
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.320
She was trying to smash.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.796
[breathes deeply]

14:59.566 --> 15:02.435
-This place is really nice.
-Yeah, do you like it?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.104
Can I get you started
with some drinks?

15:04.137 --> 15:07.207
-Yes, um, champagne?
-Uh, I'll get a vodka soda.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.109
Oh, come on, live a little.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.477
Okay, I'll get a vodka,
no soda.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.479
She'll get a champagne
and vodka soda.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.114
-I-I don't want champagne.
-We'll get the champagne.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.448
I'm not sure what to do here...

15:15.482 --> 15:17.150
Just bring, uh,
two champagnes, vodka soda,

15:17.183 --> 15:18.785
and I'll just drink it
if you don't want it.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.420
-You drove.
-Yeah, we can Uber.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.055
Pick up the car tomorrow.
It's fine.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.524
-You're acting deranged.
-Yeah, I feel deranged.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.793
-So, yeah, no, I'm good though.
-Okay.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.161
-Do I seem weird?
-Yeah, a little bit.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.529
-No, I'm feeling good.
-Yeah, oh, wow!

15:29.562 --> 15:32.499
That was really fast, um...
[chuckles]

15:32.532 --> 15:36.069
-Good. Thank you. Perfect.
-You're welcome.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.938
-Thank you so much. Yeah.
-[man 1] You're welcome.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.140
[sighs]

15:43.543 --> 15:46.346
Honey, are you okay?
Are you okay?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.180
[coughing]

15:47.213 --> 15:49.816
There it is.
I was looking for it.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.685
Um, okay, that was supposed to
be in the champagne,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.353
but it came outta your mouth.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.821
Um, it was supposed to
be in the champagne.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.222
Oh, my God!

15:58.858 --> 16:01.861
-[Peter] Taylor...
-What?

16:01.895 --> 16:05.098
[violin music]

16:06.800 --> 16:11.171
Taylor, I know we've only been
together for three years,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.239
but I feel like
I've known you my whole life.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.810
My mornings don't start until
I'm waking up next to you

16:16.843 --> 16:18.845
and they don't end until
you're laying in bed with me.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.046
Oh God!

16:20.080 --> 16:22.382
I just, I can't believe
I found you.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.051
I would love to spend
the rest of my life with you.

16:25.051 --> 16:29.055
So Taylor Bethesda Hamelin,

16:29.055 --> 16:30.190
will you marry me?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.894
I... I...
-Are you crying?

16:34.928 --> 16:37.897
-Yeah. Yes, I...
-Yes? Yes? She said yes!

16:37.931 --> 16:40.333
[applause]

16:40.367 --> 16:42.235
-No. No!
-Thank you.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.473
-No!
-No.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.441
Yes, thank you,
that's very talented

16:48.475 --> 16:50.243
but we don't need music
right now, thank you.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.879
You can all get
back to your dinner. Thank you.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.881
Can you just get up?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.349
[Taylor whimpering]

16:56.383 --> 16:58.351
Wait. I think I'm having
a panic attack.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.420
-Hey, I do love you--
-Wait, wait. I can't breathe.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.122
-Okay. Honey.
-I can't see.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.590
-Just stop for a second?
-I'm having a pa-panic attack.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.792
-I, I do love you--
-I am having a panic attack.

17:05.825 --> 17:06.826
Hey, can you stop?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.462
[breathes deeply]

17:11.631 --> 17:14.167
Okay, yep.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.037
Peter, I love you more than
I can express in words,

17:17.070 --> 17:18.805
but something about this
doesn't feel right...

17:18.838 --> 17:20.507
You-you-you're not you're ready.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.342
Well, what do you want me
to do to prove to you

17:22.375 --> 17:23.777
that I am ready, like,
would you like me

17:23.810 --> 17:25.912
to tattoo your name on my ass?

17:25.945 --> 17:27.080
The fact that you'd even
suggest that

17:27.113 --> 17:28.515
proves my point,
you're immature.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.383
I thought you liked
that about me.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.218
I like that you're
spontaneous and fun

17:32.252 --> 17:33.787
and you get me out of
my own head.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.655
But-but when I saw
you and Lexa together,

17:35.689 --> 17:38.291
i-it proved to me that
it's more than that.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.693
-You're-you're a child.
-Okay.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.661
Well, let me be your
child bride then.

17:41.695 --> 17:45.865
-My what? No! No!
-Like, I'll be your child bride.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.868
I think there's just, like,
part of you i-i-is stuck in

17:48.902 --> 17:52.605
your past, stuck in whatever
you and Lexa share together.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.175
And until you put that behind
you, I can't be with you.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.477
I don't understand why
you keep bringing up Lexa.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.813
I just don't want you to wake up
in five years and realize

17:59.846 --> 18:01.314
you married the wrong person.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.550
It's not gonna happen, Taylor.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.286
-[Peter] Taylor?
-I'm really sorry, Peter.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.022
Oh, my God!

18:12.025 --> 18:13.193
Oh, my God!

18:15.028 --> 18:16.730
[sighs]

18:16.763 --> 18:18.565
She was kidding. [clears throat]

18:21.034 --> 18:22.235
She'll come back.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.313
Peter?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.148
[door closes]

18:36.181 --> 18:37.282
Where's Taylor?
I thought you guys were

18:37.316 --> 18:38.550
staying at The Drake tonight.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.624
Peter?

18:45.657 --> 18:47.559
[Peter groaning]

18:47.593 --> 18:50.662
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-[Peter] No!

18:54.600 --> 18:55.567
There's booze here.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.472
I'll tell you what,
I'll start drinking,

19:00.506 --> 19:02.374
in honor of you
and these tough times,

19:02.408 --> 19:05.144
and if you wanna join me,
you're more than welcome to.

19:10.616 --> 19:15.187
Okay. I'm drinking alone now.
But it's in solidarity.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.157
We're gonna get through
this together, you, me,

19:18.190 --> 19:19.425
and this bottle of vodka.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.696
[clock ticking]

19:26.665 --> 19:27.299
[knocking on door]

19:27.333 --> 19:29.268
[Lexa] Okay. Enough, Peter.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.502
[knocking on door]

19:30.536 --> 19:32.171
It's been days.

19:32.204 --> 19:36.308
If you don't open this door,
I'm gonna break it down.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.677
I'm gonna have the fire
department break it down.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.712
It's open.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.715
[door opens]

19:45.250 --> 19:47.186
Okay. I'm here to help.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.854
I didn't know what stage
of grief you would be in,

19:48.887 --> 19:50.389
so I brought choices.

19:50.422 --> 19:53.225
So we have low fat ice cream
and romantic comedies.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.793
Pizza pockets
and kung fu movies.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.328
Or whiskey and porn.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.632
Okay, we'll start with
<i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>

20:00.666 --> 20:03.435
and end with
<i>When Harry bones Sally.</i>

20:03.469 --> 20:06.205
-Just give me a second.
-Okay.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.741
[muffled screaming]

20:13.412 --> 20:15.848
-Okay, I'm ready.
-Here we go.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.884
-Starting with a rom-com.
-I don't like it.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.285
-This is your medicine.
-Uh!

20:20.319 --> 20:22.888
Um, yum yum. Oooh!

20:22.921 --> 20:25.891
I hate everyone in the world
except you.

20:25.924 --> 20:29.495
Oh, yeah.
Time for Shaolin Soccer.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.329
Yaah!

20:30.362 --> 20:32.464
But I think
they're making dumplings

20:32.498 --> 20:34.933
and then
they're soccer involved.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.169
Open mouth and eat pizza.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.504
This is gonna be
the sexiest time

20:38.537 --> 20:39.905
that we've ever had right now.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.342
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God! What the...

20:43.375 --> 20:45.744
Look, keep looking at it.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.747
I thought we were gonna spend
the rest of my life together.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.283
And then it turned out
that I'm not now.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.918
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

20:52.951 --> 20:56.155
[moaning over TV]

21:03.062 --> 21:05.330
[soft music]

21:16.141 --> 21:19.445
Emilio Estevez was our waiter
last night at Red Lobster.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.948
-There's no way it was him.
-Oh! It was. Well...

21:22.981 --> 21:25.584
You and me, tomorrow night,
Red Lobster, Emilio Estevez.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.119
I'm not going to Red Lobster
with you.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.455
Because I got better things
to do than stalk somebody

21:29.488 --> 21:31.690
who probably doesn't even
resemble Emilio Estevez.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.226
And also I don't want to get
banned at another Red Lobster.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.994
What did you do?

21:36.095 --> 21:37.996
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-I'd love you to talk about it.

21:38.097 --> 21:42.001
Then fine, let's just say,
I realized you can actually

21:42.101 --> 21:44.737
get seasick from just
eating from a shellfish.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.706
Like, I-I-I knew it was a thing,
but I never realized, like,

21:47.740 --> 21:49.975
you could, just don't mix
oysters, lobsters, shrimps,

21:50.009 --> 21:51.643
and crabs all in one go.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.617
[rock music]

21:58.650 --> 22:02.654
-Oh, God!
-You look like shit.

22:02.688 --> 22:03.589
Taylor left me.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.891
-I proposed and she left.
-Yeah, I know.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.826
Everyone at the office heard
you bathroom crying.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.528
-Thank you.
-I don't know what to do, Doug.

22:09.561 --> 22:12.064
I tried emailing,
calling, texting.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.766
She's ignoring me at the office.

22:13.799 --> 22:17.069
I even sent her an Edible
Arrangement and then an EpiPen

22:17.069 --> 22:20.072
'cause she's allergic to
pineapples and I didn't want

22:20.072 --> 22:21.940
to give her the wrong idea.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.143
Hey! What can I do to help?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.844
I don't know, man. How do
I stop feeling like this?

22:25.878 --> 22:28.080
Oh, easy. Death is the most
immediate

22:28.080 --> 22:30.382
option but second to that,
start dating someone else.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.617
It's only been a week.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.419
I know, but to get
over one person,

22:33.452 --> 22:35.721
you got to get under another.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.856
Sorry, I've been watching
a lot of Sex and the City.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.891
I'm a Samantha.

22:40.259 --> 22:41.460
What am I going to do?

22:41.493 --> 22:43.095
Have you ever tried
online dating?

22:43.095 --> 22:44.763
Yeah, I'm awful at it. My bios

22:44.797 --> 22:47.566
are super awkward
and I'm bad at dick pics.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.968
Dude, you need a ring
light and a low angle.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.438
It's a good shot.
Trust. All right.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.873
If online dating is a no-go,
why not try for

22:54.907 --> 22:56.175
someone you already know?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.210
I don't like most people I know.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.878
Yeah, what about
Carol from accounting?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.380
You know, now that she's gotten
her halitosis under

23:01.413 --> 23:03.048
control, she's kind of the
office babe.

23:03.048 --> 23:07.386
-Who? Never heard of Carol.
-Yeah, we saw her on Monday.

23:07.419 --> 23:10.456
Ca-rol. We're always like,
"Oh, there's Carol!"

23:10.489 --> 23:12.725
-Darryl?
-What?

23:12.758 --> 23:14.159
-I have an awkward question.
-Okay.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.494
How come we never went out?

23:15.527 --> 23:16.762
I don't want to kick you
while you're down.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.297
Having said that,
I would rather

23:18.330 --> 23:19.598
have sex with that couch
you had in college.

23:19.631 --> 23:20.933
Oh, the one with the smells?

23:20.966 --> 23:22.701
The one that had a squirrel
living in it.

23:22.735 --> 23:27.072
-Right. Why? I'm a catch.
-You're not really my type.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.741
-Unemployed?
-Touche.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.075
You know, this is the first
time we've both

23:30.109 --> 23:31.910
been single at the same time
since college.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.946
-Where are you going with this?
-Let me just take you on a date.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.881
Friends shouldn't
rebound with friends.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.083
-Why? You're my favorite hang.
-Peter. Come on.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.386
You're the only person I can
be completely honest with.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.754
Your lumpy parts
don't disgust me.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.922
-Wow, flattery. Uh-huh.
-All good things.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.625
What if we're like Meg Ryan in
all those movies, where, like,

23:46.658 --> 23:48.961
the answer has been right
there the entire time.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.630
Or what if we're like those
porn actresses that kind of

23:51.663 --> 23:53.465
look like Meg Ryan and the only
thing that's gonna come off

23:53.499 --> 23:55.367
this is I get screwed
and you leave?

23:55.401 --> 23:57.236
Well, have you never
thought about it at all?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.771
[Lexa sighs]

23:58.804 --> 24:01.607
-Not even for a second?
-Honestly...

24:01.640 --> 24:03.575
Fine, yes, yes, of course
I've thought about it,

24:03.609 --> 24:05.277
but there's a reason I never
did anything about it.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.112
I mean, this kind of thing
only works out in the movies.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.314
-And in real life it's a mess.
-Yeah, but...

24:09.348 --> 24:10.449
we're already messes also.

24:10.482 --> 24:11.483
What's the worst
that can happen?

24:11.517 --> 24:12.584
A murder-suicide.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.753
That's pretty bad. Second worst?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.122
-We ruin the friendship.
-Not if we decide up front.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.792
We go, "Hey, guess what, we're
not gonna ruin the friendship.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.561
No matter what happens
or what does not happen."

24:22.594 --> 24:25.664
That's what we'll say.
You got it.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.733
I'll think about it.
Best and final offer.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.134
-All right, I'll take it.
-Okay.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.903
-Want to go bowling?
-No!

24:30.936 --> 24:34.106
-As friends.
-Maybe, we'll see.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.610
[indistinct chatter]

24:38.644 --> 24:39.978
[Lexa] She's really coming
into her own.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.481
-I know.
-So cute. Look at that bee.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.316
I was so worried
she'd look like Doug.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.751
Why? Doug's handsome.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.486
Yeah, well, all the parts
that you can see,

24:47.519 --> 24:48.987
but he has the weirdest
body hair.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.156
He's got this patch
on his chest that looks like

24:51.190 --> 24:54.159
the bat signal, and his ass is
hairier than his head.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.761
-What? No.
-Yeah.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.696
For our fifth anniversary,
he decided to shave himself

24:57.730 --> 24:59.565
from the neck down,
huge mistake.

24:59.598 --> 25:00.866
So, does he just
always have, like,

25:00.899 --> 25:02.601
a full body
5 o' clock shadow?

25:02.634 --> 25:05.037
Oh, yeah, I'm having sex
with a chubby cactus

25:05.037 --> 25:06.739
for the rest of my life.

25:06.772 --> 25:09.508
But, I love him, so whatever.
You know?

25:09.541 --> 25:11.477
Anyways, that is enough
about me and Doug.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.381
Are you gonna go
out with Peter?

25:15.414 --> 25:16.815
Oh, Peter told Doug
and Doug cannot

25:16.849 --> 25:18.484
keep a secret to save his life.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.320
Okay, well.
I definitely can't say yes.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.489
He just got dumped by the woman
he thought he was gonna spend

25:23.522 --> 25:25.057
the rest of his life with.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.192
Oh, my God,
you think I should yes?

25:27.226 --> 25:31.063
Okay, normally, I would say no,
but you're Lexa and Peter.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.898
We all knew you'd end up
together eventually.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.566
What do you mean,
"We all knew?"

25:34.600 --> 25:37.670
It just seemed inevitable.
He was in love with you

25:37.703 --> 25:39.705
all through college, and you
kept dating douche bags.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.540
-They weren't douche bags.
-Wife-beater Kenny?

25:41.573 --> 25:43.208
-Kenny never wore wife-beaters.
-No, Lexa.

25:43.242 --> 25:47.379
He seemed like the kind of
guy that would beat his wife.

25:47.413 --> 25:48.714
I'm not gonna argue that.

25:48.747 --> 25:51.350
Greg stole all
your underwear,

25:51.383 --> 25:52.718
and Mark who had
sex with the ficus.

25:52.751 --> 25:55.721
Mark was sleep walker.
He was sleep-humping.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.423
[laughs]

25:57.456 --> 25:58.957
I don't know, the point is,

25:58.991 --> 26:01.627
we figured you two would find
each other eventually.

26:01.660 --> 26:05.264
Why? Because a girl and a guy
can't just be friends?

26:05.297 --> 26:09.268
No, because he's just better
than the other guys you dated.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.036
And you two just always look
like you were having more

26:11.070 --> 26:13.572
fun together than everyone
else in the room.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.374
That's what it's about, right?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.909
[inhales sharply]

26:16.942 --> 26:17.910
Damn it.

26:17.943 --> 26:21.513
Are you worried it will
mess up the friendship?

26:21.547 --> 26:24.717
I'm worried because
I think you're right.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.251
Peter and I have something great
and if I can't make it

26:26.285 --> 26:28.387
work out with him,
then I won't be able to make it

26:28.420 --> 26:30.055
work out with anyone.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.424
Yeah, all due respect,
that's dumb.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.492
No, it isn't.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.894
You're letting fear control you.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.631
You are, if nothing else,
brave, Lexa.

26:39.665 --> 26:40.833
You should give it a go.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.067
Just take the time to figure out

26:42.067 --> 26:44.103
if you and Peter
are meant to be.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.274
-You know you want him.
-Maybe a little bit.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.542
[chuckling]

26:55.081 --> 26:56.282
Someone's at the door!

26:58.651 --> 27:00.553
Peter, could you grab the door?

27:00.587 --> 27:01.521
[knocking on door]

27:05.025 --> 27:06.159
[chuckling]

27:08.028 --> 27:10.263
-Hi!
-Hi!

27:10.296 --> 27:12.399
-These are for you.
-What's happening?

27:12.432 --> 27:14.668
I'm picking you up
for our date.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.202
Are we in a Hallmark movie?

27:16.236 --> 27:18.038
Most girls say "Thank you"
when you get them flowers.

27:18.038 --> 27:20.273
-I hate Hallmark movies.
-They say "Thank you."

27:20.306 --> 27:22.042
And then they say, "I'll go
put them in some water."

27:22.075 --> 27:24.044
-No, that's a lie.
-No, that's what they say.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.545
No, I secretly love
Hallmark movies.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.914
Oh, my God, same! Have you seen
<i>Christmas Village</i>

27:27.947 --> 27:29.115
<i>Town for the Christmas People?</i>

27:29.149 --> 27:30.650
-That's the best one.
-So good.

27:30.684 --> 27:34.654
-You're early.
-Yeah, there's no traffic.

27:34.688 --> 27:36.122
I'm not ready yet.

27:36.156 --> 27:39.392
Okay, I'll just
make myself at home.

27:39.426 --> 27:41.094
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

27:43.296 --> 27:45.532
I'll go put them in some water.

27:45.565 --> 27:46.566
[Peter] Thank you.

27:46.599 --> 27:47.600
[chuckles softly]

27:47.634 --> 27:50.136
[instrumental music]

27:58.845 --> 28:00.513
Thank God I made a reservation.

28:00.547 --> 28:02.148
[chuckles softly]

28:02.182 --> 28:04.150
Just one guy. [chuckles]

28:06.653 --> 28:09.089
Luke used to hate
places like this.

28:09.122 --> 28:12.258
Why did you guys
really break up?

28:12.292 --> 28:14.260
So sorry, but if this
was just a friend hang,

28:14.294 --> 28:15.562
you could totally
ask about my ex.

28:15.595 --> 28:18.231
-Lexa, come on.
-Show me a magic trick.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.566
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:19.599 --> 28:21.267
First-date-Peter
would never leave the house

28:21.301 --> 28:22.469
without a magic trick
up his sleeve.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.304
-There's no magic trick.
-Okay, I get it.

28:24.337 --> 28:25.872
You don't want to bring out
your closer too early.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.308
-There's no magic trick.
-Really?

28:28.341 --> 28:30.477
-Okay, there's a magic trick.
-That's what I thought.

28:30.510 --> 28:32.679
If you casually lean forward
so I can see down your shirt.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.314
Excuse me.

28:34.347 --> 28:36.549
I mean it won't work in this
dress, but I know your moves.

28:36.583 --> 28:39.252
-I do not do that.
-Oh, really?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.653
Oh, that's so interesting.

28:40.687 --> 28:43.723
I didn't know coconuts
weren't really nuts.

28:43.757 --> 28:48.261
Oh, wait. Hold on.
Weren't really nuts. Huh, boob.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.530
Okay, I have never talked
about nuts on a first date.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.867
Uh, I wonder what other
nuts are not really nuts.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.468
Okay.

28:55.502 --> 28:58.338
I read a-an article in
the New Yorker the other day,

28:58.371 --> 29:00.140
it was fascinating.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.242
I just wanna talk about nuts.

29:02.275 --> 29:03.677
I know this artist in Cambodia,

29:03.710 --> 29:05.011
he makes sculptures
out of shoes.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.680
I love nuts.

29:06.713 --> 29:09.582
He reminds me of this artist
that we talked about in class.

29:09.616 --> 29:12.519
-Uh, the Ivy League.
-I love nuts so much.

29:12.552 --> 29:15.422
But not as much as
having no job.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.493
I think you're less interesting
than a gum ball.

29:20.527 --> 29:24.030
-Will you marry me? Screw you.
-What? Wait, what?

29:24.064 --> 29:26.366
If you think I'm such a loser,
then why are we even doing this?

29:26.399 --> 29:27.734
I-I-I don't think
you're a loser.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.536
Then what is that,
why are you making fun

29:29.569 --> 29:31.237
of the fact I don't have
a job right now?

29:31.271 --> 29:33.573
-I was just joking.
-It's not funny. Joke funnier.

29:42.949 --> 29:47.387
[in unison] Ho! Ho! Ho!
Looking through the glass.

29:47.420 --> 29:51.091
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Looking over fence!

29:51.124 --> 29:53.059
Ho! Ho! Ho!

29:53.059 --> 29:58.932
I can't see anything except
my dad's friend Jacob.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.734
-Jacob! Jacob!
Jacob!

30:00.767 --> 30:03.403
-Where are you, Jacob?
-Oh, my God, he's on fire!

30:03.436 --> 30:06.272
-He's burning!
-Oh, no! Jacob's on fire!

30:06.306 --> 30:08.375
-Call the fireman!
-Ding-dong!

30:08.408 --> 30:10.243
-Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh!
-I'm a fire--

30:10.276 --> 30:12.812
Please... You're disturbing
the other patrons.

30:12.846 --> 30:16.016
-I'm so sorry. Sorry.
-Totally zoned out.

30:16.049 --> 30:18.184
-Sorry about that!
-Thank you.

30:18.218 --> 30:20.587
Well, we'll never
doing this again.

30:20.620 --> 30:22.822
-Never again.
-Could not have gone worse.

30:23.857 --> 30:25.291
[tummy growling]

30:25.325 --> 30:27.327
-What?
-Oh, I think I feel sick.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.430
-Oh, no, you don't.
-Yeah, no, yeah I do. Oh!

30:30.463 --> 30:33.366
-It's the other way.
-Ooh! Ooh! Oh!

30:33.400 --> 30:37.270
-Help!
-What? Help, how?

30:37.303 --> 30:38.505
[Lexa belching]

30:38.538 --> 30:40.140
Uh, we'll just get the bill.

30:40.173 --> 30:43.276
[retching]

30:44.878 --> 30:46.012
Oh, my God!

30:46.046 --> 30:48.848
[retching continues]

30:48.882 --> 30:51.451
[breathes deeply]

30:51.484 --> 30:53.853
Damn that Hole In The Wall
restaurant!

30:53.887 --> 30:55.989
Was it the restaurant
or the donut you ate

30:56.022 --> 30:58.091
out of the trash this morning?

30:58.124 --> 31:00.660
-You saw that?
-Yeah, unfortunately.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.862
[breathing deeply]

31:06.933 --> 31:08.368
I thought it was so good.

31:12.739 --> 31:16.476
But it did make me thirsty
enough to get like four chugs

31:16.509 --> 31:19.079
into that milk carton
in the back of your fridge

31:19.079 --> 31:21.748
before I realized
it had spoiled.

31:21.781 --> 31:25.151
It's amazing to me that
you're still alive.

31:25.185 --> 31:26.519
I'm a little cockroach.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.422
[retching]

31:31.891 --> 31:33.426
[coughing]

31:33.460 --> 31:37.197
So is this the, um, worst first
date you've ever had or..

31:37.230 --> 31:38.732
Don't flatter yourself.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.835
This doesn't even make top five.

31:41.868 --> 31:45.705
-I'll get you water.
-Okay. Thank you.

31:45.739 --> 31:46.740
[sighs]

31:46.773 --> 31:49.709
[instrumental music]

31:58.752 --> 32:03.256
-Great place. Love the d

32:03.289 --> 32:07.527
-How was the date?
-Bodily fluids were involved...

32:07.560 --> 32:11.398
-No, not the good ones.
-Ew. Tell me more. No. Less.

32:11.431 --> 32:15.235
Ah, I'm torn.
Hold that thought.

32:15.268 --> 32:18.571
-Ah. Hey! Nice fit.
-Hi!

32:18.605 --> 32:20.073
She's going through
De Niro phase.

32:20.073 --> 32:21.708
She's obsessed with his style.

32:21.741 --> 32:25.211
Never seen the movies. I don't
know, kid TikTok is hell.

32:25.245 --> 32:27.080
Do you remember me?
Last time we saw each other

32:27.080 --> 32:28.715
was at the Rainforest Cafe?

32:28.748 --> 32:30.116
I got you that stuffed giraffe.

32:31.584 --> 32:32.485
No, not really, no.

32:32.519 --> 32:34.320
Can you get your finger
out of your mouth?

32:34.354 --> 32:36.156
Um, can you get your
nose out of my business?

32:36.189 --> 32:39.225
-Watch it.
-Oh, you're bleeding.

32:39.259 --> 32:41.561
Honey, don't suck your blood.
It's not healthy.

32:41.594 --> 32:43.930
Why won't anyone just
let me live?

32:43.963 --> 32:45.131
[Lexa chuckles]

32:46.866 --> 32:49.936
Are you sure you can handle that
'cause she can be a handful?

32:49.969 --> 32:51.604
-Good thing I have two hands.
-Okay.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.907
We'll be fine. I know CPR.
I'll Google everything else.

32:53.940 --> 32:58.011
Amazing! You're a life saver.
I really owe you one.

32:58.111 --> 33:00.914
Yeah, I was thinking
20 bucks an hour.

33:00.947 --> 33:04.351
-Oh.
-$18?

33:04.384 --> 33:05.552
Yeah, I...

33:05.585 --> 33:08.221
Sorry, I didn't realize this
was like a job for you, so.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.223
But that's fine.
How about 30 dollars an hour?

33:10.256 --> 33:12.392
-I... No!
-No, you know CPR.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.161
-I don't CPR, it's...
-I don't know CPR.

33:15.195 --> 33:16.930
I was saying that for effects.

33:16.963 --> 33:19.299
-I think you've earned it.
-I haven't done anything.

33:19.332 --> 33:21.201
I'm trying to end
this conversation

33:21.234 --> 33:22.736
the least awkward way possible.

33:22.769 --> 33:25.071
Got it! Thank you!

33:26.439 --> 33:28.074
-Be good!
-Love you!

33:30.944 --> 33:32.445
[exhales sharply]

33:32.479 --> 33:34.381
Blake?

33:34.414 --> 33:35.415
Blake?

33:36.850 --> 33:38.818
[Blake] Don't come in.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.086
Okay!

33:45.225 --> 33:48.328
-What are you doing?
-Just working on something.

33:50.797 --> 33:54.100
An app that helps adults
find elite establishments

33:54.134 --> 33:56.836
in which to imbibe.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.338
What are you doing?

33:58.371 --> 33:59.906
Enjoying the slow march
to death,

33:59.939 --> 34:02.442
one level of Candy Crush
at a time.

34:02.475 --> 34:05.145
[Lexa chuckles softly] Nice!

34:18.224 --> 34:20.827
<i>* We are born here</i>
<i>from another *</i>

34:20.860 --> 34:22.896
<i>* We are sisters... </i>

34:22.929 --> 34:24.698
-Hello!
-Hello!

34:26.733 --> 34:27.701
Oh, don't be mad.

34:27.734 --> 34:29.436
I flushed a bunch of candy corn
down the toilet

34:29.469 --> 34:31.371
and it's making a weird noise.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.872
Why? Why would you do that?

34:32.906 --> 34:35.075
'Cause I thought it was
looking at me funny and I...

34:35.075 --> 34:36.409
-I have a surprise.
-What?

34:36.443 --> 34:38.545
-Can you get dressed? Yeah.
-Right now?

34:39.546 --> 34:40.947
<i>* We were homeless </i>

34:40.980 --> 34:45.085
<i>* Like no other alive</i>
<i>smells... *</i>

34:45.085 --> 34:47.320
-He-he-he-he!
-What are you... Whoa!

34:49.155 --> 34:51.091
Are we going to the zoo?
Or the planetarium?

34:51.091 --> 34:52.826
Well, I'm not taking you on
a middle school field trip.

34:52.859 --> 34:55.228
-Oh! Are we going to Spain?
-Yeah, we are walking to Spain.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.197
-Ha! I knew it.
-It's gonna take two years.

34:57.230 --> 34:59.099
Okay? Stop it.
Don't guess anymore.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.401
You're gonna love it, I promise.

35:01.434 --> 35:04.237
-Oh, are we going to Benihana?
-No!

35:04.270 --> 35:05.605
Okay, wait,
keep your eyeballs shut.

35:05.638 --> 35:06.606
Well, okay.

35:06.639 --> 35:08.608
Do not open your eyeball.
Ready? Keep going.

35:08.641 --> 35:10.343
Then what would be the point
of putting your hand there?

35:10.377 --> 35:12.045
-I can do it without your hand.
-Yeah, you're right.

35:12.078 --> 35:14.314
-Okay.
-Okay, ta-da!

35:14.347 --> 35:16.516
-What am I looking at?
-This is where we first met.

35:16.549 --> 35:19.886
-We first met in a lecture hall.
-No! Tha-that was Psych 102.

35:19.919 --> 35:21.321
This was the first spot. Okay,

35:21.354 --> 35:23.056
I was leaving a party
upstairs, remember?

35:23.056 --> 35:25.725
You were sitting literally right
there, drunk off your ass.

35:25.759 --> 35:27.727
I came up to you, I was like,
"Hey! Where do you live?"

35:27.761 --> 35:29.462
Because I wanted to make
sure you got home okay.

35:29.496 --> 35:31.464
-Such a freshman.
-But you forgot your address.

35:31.498 --> 35:33.199
You were like, "I forget!
I don't know where I live."

35:33.233 --> 35:35.635
And I was like, "Wait, what?"
But then,

35:35.669 --> 35:37.937
you did the entire speech
at the end of <i>Rocky--</i>

35:37.971 --> 35:39.773
<i>Rocky</i>4, yes.

35:39.806 --> 35:42.142
And when you finished,
I was like, "Whoa!

35:42.175 --> 35:44.344
this person is the coolest,"
and so we became friends.

35:44.377 --> 35:45.645
-High five!
-Aww!

35:45.679 --> 35:46.880
Well, that story's both
sweet and creepy.

35:46.913 --> 35:48.448
How is it creepy?

35:48.481 --> 35:50.083
Because apparently I didn't
remember any of that night,

35:50.116 --> 35:52.252
and you were in the back of
the lecture hall leering at me.

35:52.285 --> 35:53.920
-Were you also pining?
-I wasn't pining.

35:53.953 --> 35:55.455
Leering and pining and lusting.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.557
Okay, you ruined a moment
we were supposed to have.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.092
-It smells like farts in here.
-We're done.

35:59.092 --> 36:00.427
-Oh.
-Off to tonight's spot?

36:00.460 --> 36:02.462
Oh, there's another spot
on this train of fun?

36:02.495 --> 36:05.799
-Yes. Miniature golf.
-Yay!

36:05.832 --> 36:08.134
Right, are you prepared to
have your masculinity

36:08.168 --> 36:09.569
challenged by a girl?

36:09.602 --> 36:11.037
Oh, you think you can
beat me at this?

36:11.037 --> 36:12.739
Oh, I know I can beat
you in this game.

36:12.772 --> 36:14.374
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

36:14.407 --> 36:16.109
Every time I have played
you at this game, I won.

36:16.142 --> 36:18.278
Yeah, but I have
grown into my muscles,

36:18.311 --> 36:20.780
an-and you have withered with...

36:20.814 --> 36:22.916
Yeah? I don't even need to look.

36:22.949 --> 36:24.951
A gopher in roller skates
could beat you at this game.

36:25.051 --> 36:26.286
Well, I could beat a gopher

36:26.319 --> 36:27.954
with this golf club,
so, circle of life.

36:28.054 --> 36:30.123
I'm going to beat you so bad,
you'll think my name is Kenny.

36:30.156 --> 36:31.458
Jesus! Everyone hated him

36:31.491 --> 36:33.093
so much and no one said
anything about him?

36:33.126 --> 36:35.462
Oh, I said things. You're just
really stummer, stubborn.

36:35.495 --> 36:36.963
So you're just really stummer.

36:37.063 --> 36:38.732
[laughing]

36:38.765 --> 36:42.736
-That does sound like me. Tink!
-That was a terrible shot.

36:42.769 --> 36:44.070
But you looked
really cute doing it.

36:44.070 --> 36:46.673
Oh, thanks.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.274
The best thing about
miniatures golf is that

36:48.308 --> 36:51.644
even when you're losing,
you're winning.

36:51.678 --> 36:53.646
Oh, son!

36:53.680 --> 36:54.447
[laughing]

36:58.218 --> 37:02.188
-Ah! God, I love sports.
-I know you do.

37:02.222 --> 37:06.126
-Okay, hole two?
-Hole two, bitch!

37:06.159 --> 37:09.362
Okay, let's go!
Oh, my God! Watch out!

37:09.396 --> 37:12.799
Oh, my God! My God!

37:12.832 --> 37:15.235
What are you doing here?

37:15.268 --> 37:16.536

37:16.569 --> 37:18.304
<i>* When I feel myself </i>

-All right, okay, okay.

37:55.742 --> 37:58.345
-We're one with the wall.
-They can't see us.

37:58.378 --> 38:01.147
They can't see us
if we're part of the wall.

38:01.181 --> 38:03.283
[Lexa breathing heavily]

38:13.059 --> 38:14.728
Take me home.

38:14.761 --> 38:15.929
It's nicer.

38:19.332 --> 38:21.468
Okay, I'll look out
for your cat.

38:21.501 --> 38:23.036
Goodnight, Mrs. Yang.

38:31.111 --> 38:33.146
[breathing heavily]

38:33.179 --> 38:34.347
[Lexa laughing]

38:35.749 --> 38:36.916
Are you gonna freak me up?

38:36.950 --> 38:38.418
Yeah, um,
do you-do you want me to--

38:38.451 --> 38:41.388
-Put on some music.
-Okay. Um...

38:41.421 --> 38:42.756
-Lexa.
-What's up?

38:47.360 --> 38:49.295
[both moaning softly]

38:49.329 --> 38:52.465
[instrumental music on phone]

38:57.737 --> 38:59.205
Yeah!

38:59.239 --> 39:02.308
[both grunting]

39:03.276 --> 39:04.444
Yeah!

39:05.779 --> 39:08.782

39:08.815 --> 39:10.750

39:14.320 --> 39:18.458

39:22.529 --> 39:25.765

39:56.196 --> 39:58.965

40:02.669 --> 40:06.373

40:06.406 --> 40:08.942
[music continues]

40:12.278 --> 40:14.514
[vocalizing]

40:14.547 --> 40:15.715
[switch clicks]

40:23.123 --> 40:25.425
that if we continue
on this trajectory...

40:25.458 --> 40:26.659
[sighs]

40:26.693 --> 40:27.861
[indistinct chatter]

40:30.797 --> 40:31.831
Psst.

40:31.865 --> 40:34.401
[indistinct chatter continues]

40:39.272 --> 40:40.273
Thank you.

40:55.955 --> 40:58.825
-Hey, home is this way.
-You have gymnastics.

40:58.858 --> 41:01.861
No! Gymnastics literally
makes me want to die.

41:01.895 --> 41:03.063
Why do I have to go?

41:03.096 --> 41:04.798
Because the family calendar
says so.

41:04.831 --> 41:07.367
-So?
-Good point.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.102
All right, if you wanna skip
I'm good with that.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.937
But if your mom asks,
you were feeling sick.

41:10.970 --> 41:12.372
You cool lying to your mom?

41:12.405 --> 41:14.874
I'm eight.
Of course I lie to my mother.

41:14.908 --> 41:15.975
All right.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.139
[both sighs]

41:48.141 --> 41:51.011
-You're so good.
-Practice makes perfect.

41:51.111 --> 41:52.345
There we go again.

41:54.147 --> 41:55.382
You should be at gymnastics.

41:55.415 --> 41:58.385
-She twisted her ankle.
-My appendix exploded.

41:58.418 --> 42:00.387
Okay. How about you go get
ready for dinner?

42:00.420 --> 42:01.221
Fine.

42:02.856 --> 42:05.625
-Wash your hands.
-[Blake] Yep, yep!

42:05.658 --> 42:08.228
Sorry, I know I shouldn't
encourage her but...

42:08.261 --> 42:10.063
Oh, it's fine. I've seen her
on the balance beams,

42:10.063 --> 42:11.398
she's no Simone Biles.

42:11.431 --> 42:12.599
[chuckles]

42:12.632 --> 42:16.169
Okay, can you tell me about
what's happening with Peter?

42:16.202 --> 42:20.373
Everything is going good-ish.

42:20.407 --> 42:22.642
I mean, there's a reason why
we are best friends, right?

42:22.676 --> 42:24.411
He's sweet, he's funny but...

42:24.444 --> 42:26.312
I don't know, we've been
on a couple of dates

42:26.346 --> 42:28.715
and he still just feels like
he is my best friend

42:28.748 --> 42:30.083
who I sometimes make out with.

42:30.083 --> 42:33.353
This is very PG-13.
Have you had sex?

42:33.386 --> 42:35.088
No.

42:35.121 --> 42:37.891
So you haven't seen
his dick yet?

42:37.924 --> 42:39.826
I've seen his dick.

42:39.859 --> 42:42.562
-What? Okay.
-Through his jeans.

42:42.595 --> 42:44.397
I've not had sex with him,
so, I don't know.

42:44.431 --> 42:45.198
Oh.

42:45.231 --> 42:46.766
What if he is really weird
in bed?

42:46.800 --> 42:48.168
Even better.

42:48.201 --> 42:50.203
I dated a guy once,
he kept saying

42:50.236 --> 42:53.306
I'm having a very nice time,
while he was inside of me.

42:53.340 --> 42:55.408
-That's sweet.
-Ew! Sweet? No.

42:55.442 --> 42:57.243
That's what you say when you're
having tea with your Aunt Milred

42:57.277 --> 42:59.112
not when you're balls
deep in an 18-year-old.

42:59.145 --> 43:00.613
The best sex I ever had
was with this guy

43:00.647 --> 43:02.449
who used to collect my hairs
from the drain

43:02.482 --> 43:05.218
and make these little dolls
with them.

43:05.251 --> 43:07.087
He would make them
and then line them up,

43:07.120 --> 43:09.289
and he would name them too,
and they'd be like

43:09.322 --> 43:10.724
his neighbors and the baker

43:10.757 --> 43:12.459
and things like that,
but the sex was good.

43:12.492 --> 43:15.462
I promise, I promise, it sounds
weird. And it was weird.

43:15.495 --> 43:17.130
-Was it kinky?
-It was pretty kinky.

43:17.163 --> 43:19.366
Can you please have sex
with Peter?

43:21.067 --> 43:22.402
You obviously want to or we

43:22.435 --> 43:24.404
wouldn't be having
this conversation.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.405
[sighs]

43:29.142 --> 43:30.310
[knocking on door]

43:38.718 --> 43:40.754
-Hi.
-Hey.

43:40.787 --> 43:42.489
Uh, what are you doing here?

43:42.522 --> 43:46.493
Oh, um, I'm here to
get things that I left.

43:46.526 --> 43:49.229
Oh, okay. Uh, yeah, I didn't see
your stuff lying around.

43:49.262 --> 43:51.197
-[Taylor] My hair dryer?
-Hair dryer?

43:51.231 --> 43:53.533
-Yeah.
-Um, okay.

43:53.566 --> 43:54.868
Yeah, it's in the bottom
drawer...

43:54.901 --> 43:56.102
[Peter] Okay.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.140
[sighs]

44:02.542 --> 44:04.744
-That's... yeah, that's the one.
-Yeah.

44:04.778 --> 44:07.781
[Peter] Um, is there anything
else here?

44:07.814 --> 44:09.349
Uh, how are you?

44:10.550 --> 44:12.285
I'm fine.

44:12.318 --> 44:15.055
-It's good.
-Yeah. Well, not particularly.

44:15.055 --> 44:16.523
Right. Yeah. [scoffs]

44:18.058 --> 44:19.626
Are you, you're okay?

44:21.127 --> 44:23.663
I'm fine.

44:23.697 --> 44:24.898
Okay.

44:24.931 --> 44:27.300
I'm double parked,
so, I should go.

44:28.768 --> 44:29.703
Taylor...

44:32.872 --> 44:34.808
Thanks.

44:34.841 --> 44:37.677
Don't know what I'd do,
it's my favorite device.

44:39.579 --> 44:40.547
Okay.

44:48.088 --> 44:50.223
-Were you talking to me?
-What?

44:50.256 --> 44:52.325
-I thought I heard voices.
-Uh, no.

44:52.359 --> 44:54.961
It was just like group of men
walking up the road.

44:54.994 --> 44:58.131
But I'm gonna take a quick
showie, shower. [chuckles]

44:59.532 --> 45:00.533
Okay.

45:02.202 --> 45:04.371
[phone buzzing]

45:07.841 --> 45:09.576
Peter! Your phone's ringing!

45:09.609 --> 45:12.712
[imitates Peter] It's okay,
just pick it up. Okay.

45:12.746 --> 45:14.514
Hello.

45:14.547 --> 45:15.548
What?

45:16.616 --> 45:17.650
For next weekend?

45:19.919 --> 45:22.589
Yep, I'll let him know.
Thank you.

45:38.071 --> 45:40.340
[upbeat rock music]

45:41.074 --> 45:42.208

45:42.242 --> 45:43.410

45:49.315 --> 45:51.117
Lakeside Pines called earlier.

45:51.151 --> 45:52.919
-Oh, God, don't be mad.
-No, no, no.

45:52.952 --> 45:55.588
I'm not mad, I just don't want
this to be awkward.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.090
It makes sense that
you would wanna plan

45:57.123 --> 45:58.925
a great vacation like that
for her...

45:58.958 --> 46:00.827
-It's not for her. It's for us.

46:00.860 --> 46:02.495
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

46:02.529 --> 46:05.031
I thought it would be nice to
get away for a couple of days.

46:05.065 --> 46:07.167
-Just us. Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.668
-Okay.
-We should go horseback riding.

46:08.702 --> 46:11.237
Well, it's dead of winter
but yeah.

46:11.271 --> 46:13.373
Then what are we supposed to do
out there?

46:13.406 --> 46:14.674
Kind of eliminates
all outdoor activities.

46:14.708 --> 46:18.078
I don't know.
There's lots to do.

46:18.111 --> 46:19.479
-Wait. Oh, my God.
-What?

46:19.512 --> 46:21.147
You didn't plan us a sex
vacation for us, did you?

46:21.181 --> 46:23.249
-What? No! No, no, I know that.
-Because we haven't even...

46:23.283 --> 46:24.517
That'd be like going
from zero to--

46:24.551 --> 46:26.152
[Peter] You know,
a 100. Yeah, no.

46:26.186 --> 46:27.654
It was just...
that-that was like a break.

46:27.687 --> 46:29.589
It was a nice break,
I thought in my mind.

46:29.622 --> 46:32.092
This will be fun and the photos
were so idyllic.

46:32.125 --> 46:33.326
You do love Nora Ephron moment.

46:33.360 --> 46:38.164
-I do. Yeah. Okay.
-Okay. Okay. Mm.

46:38.198 --> 46:39.933
-Okay. Oh, God!
-No, it's not a sex vacation.

46:39.966 --> 46:41.701
I know, I know, I know, sorry.
It's just that, now that

46:41.735 --> 46:43.703
we said it,
I can't even really ignore it.

46:43.737 --> 46:45.238
-You want me to call and cancel?
-Uh-uh.

46:45.271 --> 46:46.539
-Uh-uh. No.
-I'll call and cancel.

46:46.573 --> 46:48.441
-Put the phone down. Stop.
-Excuse me.

46:48.475 --> 46:50.076
It's fine.
This is what we're gonna

46:50.110 --> 46:51.444
do, I'm going to leave
and we're gonna

46:51.478 --> 46:52.445
pretend like this conversation
never happened.

46:52.479 --> 46:53.680
Where are you going? What?

46:53.713 --> 46:55.448
-Your purse. Your beer?
-[Lexa] I'm moving.

46:55.482 --> 46:56.950
-[Lexa] You can have it.
-You're just leaving. Okay.

Welcome to The Lakeside Pines!

47:39.559 --> 47:41.695
-Hear that?
-What was that?

47:41.728 --> 47:45.765
-Oh! They're here.
-We're right here.

47:45.799 --> 47:47.500
Are we in the right spot?
We parked here?

47:51.404 --> 47:54.240
-That's firm.
-The bed, yeah. It's nice.

47:54.708 --> 47:55.709
Bed.

47:58.378 --> 47:59.913
Oh, Jesus, we're about
to scissor, aren't we?

48:00.013 --> 48:01.881
Okay, don't... Okay,
take a-take a breath.

48:01.915 --> 48:03.650
And then you're going to
want to be the little spoon.

48:03.683 --> 48:05.018
Well, what if I want to be
the little...

48:05.051 --> 48:06.553
-You're freaking out. Yeah.
-No, I'm not.

48:06.586 --> 48:08.054
-You're freaking out a little--
-No, I'm not.

48:08.088 --> 48:09.522
-Just a little bit.
-I'm not. You're freaking out.

48:09.556 --> 48:11.224
I'm not freaking out.

48:11.257 --> 48:12.759
[exhales deeply]
What if it's bad?

48:12.792 --> 48:15.462
Okay, worst things have happened
to better people.

[Lexa chuckles]

48:19.332 --> 48:20.700
You're my best friend.

So, whatever does
or doesn't happen here...

48:24.204 --> 48:25.705
it won't change that.

48:25.739 --> 48:27.540
-Okay. Okay.
-It won't. Okay?

48:27.574 --> 48:29.242
Sex has destroyed
civilizations, I think

48:29.275 --> 48:30.543
it could take us down
if it wanted to.

48:30.577 --> 48:31.945
Well, you aren't Helen of Troy.

48:32.045 --> 48:35.048

49:52.659 --> 49:56.863
All those years of field work
have made you quite a contender.

49:56.896 --> 49:59.566

a bunch of fancy words

49:59.599 --> 50:02.502

-I'm hungry.

50:23.923 --> 50:25.058
-Okay.
-Okay.

50:25.091 --> 50:26.159
Let's get something to eat.

50:26.192 --> 50:28.795
-We'll eat.
-Again.

50:28.828 --> 50:29.596
[laughing]

50:29.629 --> 50:33.133
-Oh, that was a good one.
-Thanks.

50:33.166 --> 50:35.301
[Peter] Basket's over there.
[Lexa] Yeah.

50:35.335 --> 50:38.138
-You want to get it?
-You go get it.

50:38.171 --> 50:39.205
Okay.

50:39.239 --> 50:40.306
[Lexa laughs]

50:40.340 --> 50:41.941
Jam?

50:41.975 --> 50:43.910
No, actually, this is
a marmalade, not a jam.

50:43.943 --> 50:44.811
Here, try it.

50:44.844 --> 50:46.479
You almost stabbed me
in the eye.

50:46.513 --> 50:48.915
But I didn't,
and that's what matters.

50:48.948 --> 50:52.585
Oh, anyway, a jam's usually made
of crushed or chopped fruits,

50:52.619 --> 50:54.921
sugar, pectin, lemon juice,

50:54.954 --> 50:58.725
marmalades are made
with citrus fruits.

50:58.758 --> 51:00.827
And pieces of peel. Oh, God.
Oh, stop it.

51:00.860 --> 51:03.329
That is the most boring thing
I have ever heard in my life.

51:03.363 --> 51:04.931
Just wait till
we get to compote.

51:04.964 --> 51:06.700
Isn't that a movie with
Philip Seymour Hoffmann?

51:06.733 --> 51:08.401
-That's <i>Copote.</i>
-Right.

51:08.435 --> 51:09.602
[chuckles]

51:12.072 --> 51:13.073
Too much sugar.

51:17.944 --> 51:18.912
What's that?

51:27.253 --> 51:29.422
Don't fight me,
don't fight.

51:29.456 --> 51:30.657
Is there a fight coming?

51:31.991 --> 51:33.526
Yeah, it depends
on the next ten seconds.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.962
Okay. Lexa.

51:35.995 --> 51:39.632
Um, I was gonna bring Taylor
here and then we broke up.

51:39.666 --> 51:41.901
-And I forgot to cancel--
-Of course.

51:41.935 --> 51:43.903
This was for Taylor.
We both hate stuff like this.

51:43.937 --> 51:46.740
W-wait. Actually, no, actually
I did cancel, I tried to cancel.

51:46.773 --> 51:49.509
Peter, I even asked you if it
was for her. I gave you the out.

51:49.542 --> 51:51.244
Would you prefer,
I told you the truth?

51:51.277 --> 51:53.279
Yes, no, I-I don't know.
We just,

51:53.313 --> 51:54.948
we never lie to each other ever.

51:54.981 --> 51:56.750
Really? So the real reason
you broke up with Luke

51:56.783 --> 51:57.951
was 'cause of his big teeth?

51:59.519 --> 52:00.687
[scoffs]

52:02.389 --> 52:04.758
If you had told me the truth,
it would've been weird.

52:04.791 --> 52:06.259
But I still would've wanted
to come because

52:06.292 --> 52:08.828
I would've been with you
and we always have fun together.

52:08.862 --> 52:13.066
-But, this changes things.
-Okay, wait. Lexa, wait.

52:13.066 --> 52:15.068
-Ooh, ooh, ooh! Do it with me.
-No.

52:15.068 --> 52:16.736
Just one time.
Looking through the glass--

52:16.770 --> 52:19.906
-Peter, stop.
-[Peter] Ooh, ooh! Over things?

52:19.939 --> 52:21.241
Your turn. Chime in. Please.

52:21.274 --> 52:22.809
You can't just sing
the <i>Jacob Song</i>

52:22.842 --> 52:24.210
and expect everything
to be better.

52:25.478 --> 52:26.846
Not this time.

52:30.083 --> 52:31.084
I feel gross.

52:33.520 --> 52:34.688
[sighs]

52:36.656 --> 52:37.824
[door opens]

52:39.559 --> 52:42.696
[mellow music]

52:43.563 --> 52:44.731
[sighs]

52:57.510 --> 52:59.145
Hey!

52:59.179 --> 53:00.513
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

53:00.547 --> 53:04.484
-Came to get a paper clip. Yeah.
-Oh, cool. Nice.

53:04.517 --> 53:06.052
Last week would've been
our anniversary.

53:06.052 --> 53:08.221
-You know? Yeah.
-I know. Yeah. Yeah.

53:08.254 --> 53:09.789
So, I know that things
are weird between us

53:09.823 --> 53:11.391
but I was wondering if you
wanted to come over

53:11.424 --> 53:13.593
for dinner Thursday?

53:13.626 --> 53:15.328
That night that you proposed,
I said some things

53:15.362 --> 53:16.730
that I shouldn't have and...

53:16.763 --> 53:18.498
I-I just would
really like to talk.

53:18.531 --> 53:22.202
-Because, I, I miss you.
-Yeah. Um, well, I gotta...

53:22.235 --> 53:23.570
-I gotta get these to Dave.
-Mm-mm.

53:23.603 --> 53:26.373
-'Cause Dave said he needed--
-Yeah. Dave.

53:26.406 --> 53:28.074
Oh, you're gonna do it
right now? Okay.

53:28.108 --> 53:29.542
Yeah. Except, Dave's
the other way.

53:29.576 --> 53:31.211
No, I know, I know,
I was just looking.

53:31.244 --> 53:32.579
Okay.

53:32.612 --> 53:35.448
Uh, Thursday, invitation's open.

53:36.783 --> 53:40.820
Yeah, not for you.
No offense. Yeah.

53:43.790 --> 53:44.791
Yeah.

53:47.660 --> 53:48.628
[sighs]

53:51.631 --> 53:52.632
[door closes]

53:53.600 --> 53:55.235
[Peter] Hey!

53:55.268 --> 53:57.303
-Yeah?
-You're ready to go?

53:58.805 --> 54:00.573
Doug and Ella? Dinner?

54:00.607 --> 54:03.576
Oh God, yeah, I forgot.
Can you just make up a lie?

54:03.610 --> 54:06.079
I don't want to deal with them
asking questions about our trip.

54:06.112 --> 54:08.314
You're gonna make me
face them alone.

54:08.348 --> 54:10.216
Seems like the least
you can do, yeah.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.152
No, don't do this to me.

54:12.185 --> 54:13.620
Ella's gonna figure out
that we got in a fight.

54:13.653 --> 54:15.789
-She's gonna yell at me.
-She's a great friend that way.

54:15.822 --> 54:17.524
And then Doug gonna drink
too many wine spritzers

54:17.557 --> 54:19.626
and start crying about
how much he loves Blake.

54:19.659 --> 54:23.063
Phew! That sounds
awful. God speed.

54:23.063 --> 54:24.798
[sighs]

54:24.831 --> 54:25.765
Lexa?

54:27.200 --> 54:28.368
Please.

54:29.536 --> 54:31.638
I'm just a poor boy.

54:31.671 --> 54:34.307
[babbles]

54:34.341 --> 54:37.210
[inhales deeply] Fine.

54:37.243 --> 54:39.646
Give me like five minutes
to get dressed.

54:39.679 --> 54:40.680
[Peter] Okay.

54:44.117 --> 54:45.285
[grunts]

54:49.189 --> 54:51.658
Welcome to Casa de Doug
y Ella y Blake!

54:51.691 --> 54:53.960
-Wow, take it down a notch.
-What? It's Fiesta Night.

54:53.993 --> 54:56.996
I made fiesta fajitas.
Come on, feel the music.

54:57.097 --> 54:59.699
-Okay, all right.
-Would you give us a minute?

54:59.733 --> 55:02.102
Oh!

55:02.135 --> 55:03.670
-What're you doing?
-Let's make up.

55:03.703 --> 55:06.072
I'm over this fight. Yeah.
I thought about it and what you

55:06.106 --> 55:07.674
did wasn't that bad, plus,
I think we're gonna need

55:07.707 --> 55:09.042
each other to get through
this Fiesta night.

55:09.042 --> 55:10.844
[Doug] You know,
the door isn't sound proof.

55:10.877 --> 55:12.512
If we're fighting,
they're gonna pick up on it.

55:12.545 --> 55:14.347
It's gonna make this
even weirder.

55:14.381 --> 55:16.049
-Okay, um...
-[Doug] Super thin.

55:16.049 --> 55:17.717
It's definitely gonna get weird.

55:17.751 --> 55:19.319
Okay, so you wanna just skip
to the end where

55:19.352 --> 55:20.854
we make up like we always do?

55:20.887 --> 55:22.722
Yeah, if that's how you wanna
look at it, sure.

55:22.756 --> 55:25.392
-But it feels so easy.
-Take the win, <i>Lambida.</i>

55:25.425 --> 55:26.693
[knocking on door]

55:27.560 --> 55:28.528
<i>-Ole.</i>
-Hey.

55:28.561 --> 55:31.598
-Hi!
-Hi, wow!

55:31.631 --> 55:33.733
-Did you hear us fighting?
-I heard everything.

55:33.767 --> 55:34.768
-Thank you.
-[Doug] You doing okay?

55:34.801 --> 55:36.169
[Peter] Yeah.
[Doug] Hi.

55:36.202 --> 55:37.203
[Ella] Welcome.

55:37.237 --> 55:38.972
I was kidding.

55:39.072 --> 55:41.374
No, it's so horrible,
they like suck up your blood,

55:41.408 --> 55:42.509
you're their food source.

55:42.542 --> 55:44.277
Argh! I'm gotta throw up.

55:44.310 --> 55:45.879
This was delicious Doug,
thank you.

55:45.912 --> 55:48.214
Taylor gave us the recipe
actually, sorry.

55:48.248 --> 55:49.716
Oh, that's okay,
you can say her name.

55:49.749 --> 55:52.652
Yeah. That's not awkward at all.

55:52.686 --> 55:54.454
-Don't make that noise.
-What?

55:54.487 --> 55:56.289
That noise. That's gross,
we have guests.

55:56.322 --> 55:57.357
-I don't care.
-I'm fine.

55:57.390 --> 55:58.892
See, they don't care.

55:58.925 --> 56:00.727
I think you're being polite
because it's disgusting.

56:00.760 --> 56:03.763
I think, they all remember you
slipping on your own vomit.

56:03.797 --> 56:05.231
-I remember that.
-I remember that.

56:05.265 --> 56:06.599
And, it doesn't matter.

56:06.633 --> 56:07.467
[laughs]

56:07.500 --> 56:09.302
What? Gosh, does it count?

56:09.336 --> 56:11.071
-Yes, it does.
-[Peter] Those are tense.

56:11.104 --> 56:13.573
[Doug] Mm-hm.
[Ella] Hm.

56:13.606 --> 56:15.475
-[Lexa] Are you...
-Are you, what?

56:15.508 --> 56:19.679
-In AA?
-No. Why would you ask that?

56:19.713 --> 56:23.783
-You're pregnant.
-Oh! No, um...

56:23.817 --> 56:26.052
-I was going to some meetings.
-You're pregnant.

56:26.052 --> 56:28.054
-Because you stopped drinking.
-I'm not pregnant.

56:28.088 --> 56:29.923
Wait a minute, I haven't seen
you smoke in weeks.

56:29.956 --> 56:31.958
-You were smoking?
-You're in the family way.

56:32.058 --> 56:33.793
-With child.
-I had to give up my cigars.

56:33.827 --> 56:35.528
And this whole time
you've been smoking?

56:35.562 --> 56:37.597
Hey, okay. First of all,

56:37.630 --> 56:39.165
I don't big, not even
metaphorically.

56:39.199 --> 56:40.734
-I know that.
-Second of all.

56:40.767 --> 56:42.969
When you smoke cigars
you smell like my father.

56:43.069 --> 56:45.772
I was starting to have very
complicated dreams.

56:45.805 --> 56:48.074
And third of all,
I am not pregnant.

56:48.074 --> 56:50.276
-Hm.
-Mm. Mm-hm.

56:50.310 --> 56:52.078
-Hm.
-[Doug] Hm. Ahem!

56:54.280 --> 56:56.216
-She's pregnant!
-[Ella] Doug!

56:56.249 --> 56:57.484
-I'm sorry. What?
-Oh, God!

56:57.517 --> 56:59.619
I'm sorry. I had to tell.
I'm so excited.

56:59.652 --> 57:04.824
-Yaay! Congratulations.
-Jesus, um, I'm at ten weeks.

57:04.858 --> 57:06.760
We just had agreed
not to tell anyone

57:06.793 --> 57:09.129
because we've had some false
starts, so...

57:09.162 --> 57:10.063
Yeah.

57:11.731 --> 57:14.067
-And we're moving to suburbs.
-Damnit, Doug.

57:14.100 --> 57:15.735
[Doug] I told you, I'm bursting.

57:15.769 --> 57:17.137
-Wow!
-[Doug] Yeah!

57:17.170 --> 57:19.105
Good schools, the kids
will have a backyard--

57:19.139 --> 57:20.774
[Ella] I guess they know
what the suburbs are.

57:20.807 --> 57:22.442
But I thought you guys were
such city people.

57:22.475 --> 57:24.044
[Peter] Where're you thinking?
Like, Evanston?

57:24.044 --> 57:26.046
Well, we've just put an offer
on a place in Oak Park.

57:26.046 --> 57:28.848
-Oak Park, that's on my list.
-Your "list?"

57:28.882 --> 57:30.583
[Doug] I mean,
it just makes sense. Right?

57:30.617 --> 57:32.652
Quick commute for work,
the kids will have fun.

57:32.686 --> 57:36.356
We're going up.
Moving to the suburbs!

57:36.389 --> 57:39.726
-Nice.
-Yes, really nice.

57:41.361 --> 57:42.529
And you're excited?

57:44.531 --> 57:46.733
-Yes, I'm excited.
-Yes!

57:46.766 --> 57:49.202
I'll drink to that. Cheers.

57:49.235 --> 57:53.073
-[Peter] Congratulations, guys.
-Thank you, thank you.

57:53.106 --> 57:55.241
So happy for you guys.

57:55.275 --> 57:57.844
[Ella] Please drink my wine.
[Peter] Happy for you.

57:57.877 --> 57:59.479
[Peter] I could cry right now.
But I'm not gonna.

57:59.512 --> 58:00.880
[Doug] You look little
jealous today.

58:00.914 --> 58:04.651
[Ella] Please don't. You haven't
even had dessert yet.

58:10.090 --> 58:11.057
[Peter chuckles softly]

58:15.095 --> 58:19.733
-I'm too big a screw up for you.
-You are not a screw up.

58:19.766 --> 58:21.634
A baby called me a screw up at
the supermarket the other...

58:21.668 --> 58:23.570
A baby did not call you
a screw up.

58:23.603 --> 58:25.872
-He did. With his eyes.
-You're a lunatic.

58:25.905 --> 58:27.774
-But you aren't a screw up.
-I am.

58:27.807 --> 58:29.609
Okay, if you're a screw up,
then I'm a screw up.

58:29.642 --> 58:32.112
-That's adorable.
-I pee in the shower.

58:32.145 --> 58:36.383
-Not sometimes, every day.
-That's all you got?

58:36.416 --> 58:39.386
Sometimes I pee in the shower
when I'm not taking a shower.

58:39.419 --> 58:41.721
Why? It's really weird.

58:41.755 --> 58:43.556
I lost my neighbor's cat
and instead of telling him,

58:43.590 --> 58:45.658
I replaced it with a cat
from the shelter.

58:48.428 --> 58:50.930
I forgot to pay my bills,

58:50.964 --> 58:53.500
so I didn't have hot water
or power for three weeks.

58:53.533 --> 58:55.935
I sometimes go to soup kitchens
just to watch homeless people

58:55.969 --> 58:57.470
and feel better about myself.

58:57.504 --> 59:00.073
Well, you know what?
You're a bad person.

59:00.106 --> 59:02.342
But you're not a screw up.

59:02.375 --> 59:03.677
Who cares?

59:03.710 --> 59:06.713
You should. You want to move
to the suburbs.

59:08.014 --> 59:10.617
-Yeah, one day.
-Yeah. With a wife and kids...

59:10.650 --> 59:12.886
Well, I don't need
the picket fence thing.

59:12.919 --> 59:14.454
-But, yeah, that's the idea.
-Well, you can't do that.

59:14.487 --> 59:16.756
With someone who's life is a
mess. I mean, I guess you could,

59:16.790 --> 59:18.491
like my mom did.
but look how that turned out.

59:18.525 --> 59:20.593
You're not a mess.
You turned out great.

59:20.627 --> 59:21.928
What're you talking about?

59:25.031 --> 59:28.568
I didn't break up with Luke
because of his teeth.

59:28.601 --> 59:31.838
I actually really
loved his beaver teeth.

59:31.871 --> 59:34.040
But he started bringing
up the future.

59:34.040 --> 59:38.912
The wife and the kids, and I
felt myself pushing him away.

59:38.945 --> 59:41.448
And then, Luke met
Kimberly Mint.

59:41.481 --> 59:42.649
Kimberly's are bitches.

59:42.682 --> 59:46.786
Maybe, but she was ready
for all that.

59:46.820 --> 59:48.621
And Luke fell in love
with her instead.

59:48.655 --> 59:52.826
And when that happened,
I fell apart.

59:52.859 --> 59:55.528
I drank too much,
and I smoked too much.

59:55.562 --> 59:58.531
And, I messed up at work
and got fired.

59:58.565 --> 59:59.733
-The sandwich place?
-[Lexa] Yeah.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.002
-Free sandwiches?
-[Lexa] Yeah.

01:00:02.035 --> 01:00:03.370
And then my landlord
threatened to evict me

01:00:03.403 --> 01:00:05.138
so I moved back here.

01:00:07.807 --> 01:00:10.377
You're ready for
something serious.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.912
And that's great.

01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:15.982
But I don't know if I'm ever
gonna be a Kimberly Mint.

01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:18.551
[mellow music]

01:00:22.655 --> 01:00:23.823
[Peter sighs]

01:00:33.266 --> 01:00:37.470
<i>* I love thunder </i>

01:00:40.006 --> 01:00:41.274
Why're you looking at me
like that?

01:00:41.307 --> 01:00:43.009
-Try it.
-Well, now, I don't want to.

01:00:43.043 --> 01:00:45.812
-Just try it.
-You try it.

01:00:45.845 --> 01:00:47.347
I didn't do anything
weird to it.

01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:52.652
I don't know.

01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:54.254
You're seriously going to ruin
this right now, aren't you?

01:00:54.287 --> 01:00:55.588
Ruin what?
Your assassination attempt?

01:00:55.622 --> 01:00:57.390
It's only an assassination

01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.459
attempt if you're of
international significance.

01:00:59.492 --> 01:01:01.261
But you don't denying
you're trying to kill me?

01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:04.164
It's eggplant parmigiana,
Peter. Eggplant.

01:01:04.197 --> 01:01:07.334
-Oh! So, I'm the butthole.
-Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:11.871
Hm.

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:14.908
-It's good.
-You hate it.

01:01:14.941 --> 01:01:16.676
I want to like it,
but it's not me.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.079
I went to the dark side
and I can't come back.

01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:21.114
-You're unbelievable.
-Actually, yeah, no.

01:01:21.147 --> 01:01:23.516
The tastes are kicking in
at the end and it's now

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.518
forming a beautiful thing
that you've done.

01:01:25.552 --> 01:01:27.620
Thank you, I'm gonna
keep eating it, watch.

01:01:27.654 --> 01:01:29.889
Watch this. Ready? Hm!

01:01:29.923 --> 01:01:31.291
When I said "No" to your
proposal, I said

01:01:31.324 --> 01:01:34.494
it was because you weren't ready
but I wasn't ready.

01:01:34.527 --> 01:01:35.995
You-you weren't who I was
expecting to

01:01:36.096 --> 01:01:37.797
end up with,
you think farts are funny.

01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:40.100
Well, objectively they are.
Like scientifically.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.234
You didn't have
health insurance until

01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:42.569
I gave it to you
for your birthday.

01:01:42.602 --> 01:01:44.504
You're a man-child,
it freaked me out and--

01:01:44.537 --> 01:01:46.573
Wait, did you just invite me
over to insult my personality?

01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:49.109
I invited you over to
ask you to marry me.

01:01:50.643 --> 01:01:51.911
What?

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:56.649
-Oh, my God! Are you dying?
-Why would I be dying?

01:01:56.683 --> 01:01:58.551
I don't know. Why would you
ask me to marry you?

01:01:58.585 --> 01:02:00.787
-You annoy the shit out of me.
-Okay.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.957
And, there are so many things
that, that drive me crazy

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:05.125
about you, like, you-you leave

01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:07.527
your dirty socks
in my living room.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.063
And-and you put the empty milk
carton back in the fridge

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:11.631
instead of throwing it out,
and you've made

01:02:11.664 --> 01:02:14.067
the 11 o'clock news
into a drinking game,

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:16.670
for God's sake but for some
stupid reason

01:02:16.703 --> 01:02:18.371
you're the first person I think
about in the morning,

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.373
and the last person
I think about at night.

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:22.075
I'm just a little bit confused

01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:23.943
because 90 percent of that
was insult.

01:02:23.977 --> 01:02:25.378
And a ten percent stalker.

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:27.147
Well, I love you so much
I can look past

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.516
all of your glaring flaws.

01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:31.584
Thank you. [chuckles]

01:02:31.618 --> 01:02:33.086
You're the person
that I can't live without

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:35.321
that I don't want to
live without.

01:02:35.355 --> 01:02:37.991
-You broke up with me, Taylor.
-I know.

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:39.993
I just, I-I was nervous that,
that you

01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:41.661
and I could never have
what you and Lexa have.

01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:43.530
I broke up with you
because I was scared

01:02:43.563 --> 01:02:45.932
and dumb, not because
I stopped loving you.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.702
I never stopped loving you
either.

01:02:50.136 --> 01:02:51.304
Then let's get married.

01:02:52.806 --> 01:02:54.107
I can't.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:55.442
Why? Give me one
good reason why.

01:02:57.811 --> 01:02:59.846
I'm dating Lexa.

01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:02.482
Oh! That's a good reason.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:06.720
-Yeah.
-Is it serious?

01:03:06.753 --> 01:03:09.689
I don't know, it's complicated,
it's been a month only but...

01:03:13.727 --> 01:03:16.963
Yeah, I don't, I don't know
what else to say, Taylor.

01:03:18.798 --> 01:03:20.066
Say you'll marry me.

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:25.071

01:03:32.212 --> 01:03:33.380
I need to talk to you.

01:04:16.189 --> 01:04:18.458
Call her a cab
to go somewhere else?

01:04:18.491 --> 01:04:20.427
[Ella] We can't kick her out.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.462
[Doug] I'm not saying to
kick her out. I'm just saying

01:04:22.495 --> 01:04:25.065
at a certain point,
you're too old to be

01:04:25.065 --> 01:04:27.167
crashing at people's places.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.868
She's going through
a really rough time.

01:04:28.902 --> 01:04:30.837
We're all going through
a rough time, sweetie.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:34.507
That's literally what being
an adult is, a rough time.

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:38.378
Jeez! When did you become
so hard-hearted?

01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:41.414
I just want my living room,
is that so wrong?

01:04:42.782 --> 01:04:43.783
She's our friend.

01:04:45.251 --> 01:04:47.320
You ever wonder if we met
some of the people

01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:48.722
we're friends with now,

01:04:48.755 --> 01:04:50.357
we'd still want to be
friends with them?

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:01.067
-Journal about it. Okay.
-Oh, I will.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:07.173
-Wife was rude.
-[Ella] Wife is hot as shit.

01:05:10.777 --> 01:05:13.113
Aren't you old to-old to
be a babysitter?

01:05:13.146 --> 01:05:16.416
-No.
-My last babysitter was 14.

01:05:16.449 --> 01:05:18.818
Oh, so your parents made
two bad decisions I see.

01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:22.489
Yeah, well, Lexa's my babysitter
for now but she also has an app.

01:05:22.522 --> 01:05:25.091
-So...
-Yeah. That's right.

01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:30.497
So do you still have to live
with your parents?

01:05:32.065 --> 01:05:33.833
[inhales deeply]

01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:37.270
Listen. Being an adult is hard.

01:05:37.303 --> 01:05:38.772
Harder than people tell you,
and sometimes

01:05:38.805 --> 01:05:40.440
your plans don't work out
and your whole life

01:05:40.473 --> 01:05:42.442
goes to hell and the worst part
about it is

01:05:42.475 --> 01:05:44.077
nobody is even surprised because
you're just fulfilling

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:46.680
this little prophecy that they
had in their head for you.

01:05:46.713 --> 01:05:49.883
So, basically everything about
being an adult sucks.

01:05:49.916 --> 01:05:52.285

01:05:52.318 --> 01:05:54.554

-Please, don't do that. Um...
-Being an adult sucks?

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:01.027
Lexa, fix it, fix it, fix it!

01:06:01.027 --> 01:06:05.265
It's just gonna suck for a long
time and then you die?

01:06:05.298 --> 01:06:07.934
-That's it?
-No! No, no, no. No, no.

01:06:08.034 --> 01:06:09.469
That's not what's gonna happen.

01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:11.805
You seem like a great kid
with rich enough parents

01:06:11.838 --> 01:06:13.273
so, you're probably gonna be
totally fine

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:15.041
even if you have a run
for a few years,

01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:16.609
it's gonna be cool,
you're gonna be cool.

01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.878
So, just relax.

01:06:18.912 --> 01:06:20.847
And here, have a string cheese.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.882
I'm not supposed to have dairy.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:24.184

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.456
Thank you.

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:32.859
Okay, listen, you guys.
You're great.

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:34.928
And, I'm a screw-up.

01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:36.596
You guys don't have anything
to worry about.

01:06:36.629 --> 01:06:39.232
-Oh, my God! Stop.
-What?

01:06:39.265 --> 01:06:42.535
Your biggest problem is you.
You're so mopey.

01:06:42.569 --> 01:06:46.506
But your life is pretty good.
You kind of have a job,

01:06:46.539 --> 01:06:49.743
you get to hang out with me all
day which is obviously sick.

01:06:49.776 --> 01:06:52.879
You have an app
which could totally fail,

01:06:52.912 --> 01:06:55.181
but at least you're trying
to do something.

01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:56.616
Most adults don't even try.

01:06:56.649 --> 01:07:00.520
They settle down and get
a 9 to 5, like my dad.

01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:01.788
-Your dad's great.
-No shit.

01:07:01.821 --> 01:07:04.491
He's the best,
but he's not brave.

01:07:07.594 --> 01:07:10.296
Ugh, all this motivational
speaking made me tired

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:12.465

a snack break.

01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:28.667
-I'm gonna shower.
-Mm-hm.

01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:29.868
[Peter exhales deeply]

01:09:30.469 --> 01:09:32.037
[sighs]

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:35.140
[breathing heavily]

01:09:36.675 --> 01:09:37.643
Oh, my God!

01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:41.146
[exhales deeply]

01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:45.351
[water running]

01:09:45.384 --> 01:09:50.122
Pete, so like...
what was it like dating her?

01:09:50.155 --> 01:09:51.724
Peter? I know you can hear me.

01:09:51.757 --> 01:09:55.761
[Peter] This is a trap. This
whole conversation is a trap.

01:09:55.794 --> 01:09:57.663
-It's a simple question.
-Okay.

01:09:57.696 --> 01:10:00.632
I-I'm not the bad guy here.
I played by the rules.

01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:02.101
You broke up with me.

01:10:02.134 --> 01:10:04.803
I didn't tell you to sleep
with your best friend!

01:10:04.837 --> 01:10:06.939
I know that you're hurt right
now but I did not

01:10:06.972 --> 01:10:08.273
cheat on you, I was depressed

01:10:08.307 --> 01:10:09.775
and I was looking for someone
to feel better.

01:10:09.808 --> 01:10:12.144
-So wait, it was a rebound?
-Yes. No, a 100 percent.

01:10:12.177 --> 01:10:14.113
It was a mistake.
She's gasoline, I'm a match.

01:10:14.146 --> 01:10:15.948
You're the person
I'm meant to be with.

01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:18.150
And it's over?

01:10:18.183 --> 01:10:20.252
It's complicated.
I'll, I'll fix--

01:10:20.285 --> 01:10:22.821
You didn't fix it already?
Like, what does that mean?

01:10:22.855 --> 01:10:25.758
And why is your junk covered?
What are you doing?

01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:27.226
'Cause this is a hostile
situation.

01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:30.562
"Hostile?" It's not hostile,
Peter. I love you.

01:10:30.596 --> 01:10:34.667
I'm in no hostility towards him.
He's my... I love him.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.168
-I deserve him.
-You deserve it.

01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:38.437
I deserve to see him
at all times.

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:39.405
Yes, you do.

01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:41.273
Come on.

01:10:43.442 --> 01:10:46.078
Okay, don't-don't pee
in the shower, please.

01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.279
[Peter] Huh?

01:10:54.586 --> 01:10:55.554
How have you been?

01:10:56.789 --> 01:10:58.624
I slept with a kid named River.

01:10:59.525 --> 01:11:00.659
-No.
-Yep.

01:11:00.693 --> 01:11:02.261
I screwed a River,
you nailed a Pond.

01:11:02.294 --> 01:11:04.630
[chuckles] Her name was Lake.

01:11:04.663 --> 01:11:07.099
Oh, I saw your app in the app
store. It's really great.

01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:08.967
Oh, were you one of the
nine people

01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:10.336
that have downloaded it so far?

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:13.072
-Well, these things take time.
-Yeah, I tried.

01:11:13.072 --> 01:11:14.473
There's something to that,
right?

01:11:14.506 --> 01:11:16.742
Exactly. Yeah. You should be
proud of yourself.

01:11:16.775 --> 01:11:18.444
-I am.
-Good.

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:26.552
Can we not do this anymore?
This sucks.

01:11:26.585 --> 01:11:28.954
-Can we just go back to normal?
-That's not that easy.

01:11:28.987 --> 01:11:31.256
Yes, it is. We agreed that if
dating didn't work out,

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:32.324
we would go back
to being friends

01:11:32.358 --> 01:11:33.859
just like nothing had changed.

01:11:33.892 --> 01:11:36.595
-Things did change.
-Why? Because we had sex?

01:11:36.628 --> 01:11:38.163
No, because I'm engaged.

01:11:38.197 --> 01:11:41.133
-Bro's before hoes. Yes, I am.
-You're not my bro.

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:43.002
I don't sleep
with my other bro's.

01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:45.371
So this is because we had sex.

01:11:45.404 --> 01:11:48.374
No, it's because
I'm getting married

01:11:48.407 --> 01:11:52.011
and I can't put our friendship
above everything else anymore.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.147
I'm not asking you to do that.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.483
I can't hurt Taylor anymore.

01:11:57.516 --> 01:11:59.451
I'm not asking you to
do that either.

01:12:00.853 --> 01:12:03.055
I think we just need
to take some space.

01:12:03.055 --> 01:12:05.491
How much space do you need? We
already haven't spoken in weeks.

01:12:05.524 --> 01:12:08.660
Well, as much as it takes to
make her feel okay.

01:12:08.694 --> 01:12:11.063
Wait, are, are you
friend-dumping me right now?

01:12:11.063 --> 01:12:14.066
I wish there was another way,
but I-I-I just can't see it.

01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:17.403
Okay, so not only can we not go
back to being best friends

01:12:17.436 --> 01:12:20.072
like you agreed we would, but
we can't be friends at all?

01:12:22.074 --> 01:12:23.342
I don't know what else to say.

01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:29.815
I want to kill you right now.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:35.120
How? By tying me to two horse

01:12:35.154 --> 01:12:36.689
drawn carts
and having them run--

01:12:36.722 --> 01:12:37.723
Oh, Lex!

01:12:54.873 --> 01:12:57.976
Okay, um, these...
Your butt looks

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.045
really good in this.

01:13:00.045 --> 01:13:01.914
-Keep?
-Yes.

01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:06.485
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Totally.

01:13:06.518 --> 01:13:08.287
You excited about tonight?

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.356
Not really, you know.

01:13:10.389 --> 01:13:12.624
Bachelorettes are a rite
of passage, right?

01:13:12.658 --> 01:13:15.327
-I suppose.
-What are you boys doing?

01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:18.197
Oh. Well, if there is a God,
nothing.

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:19.798
-Keep box.
-Yes.

01:13:19.832 --> 01:13:23.202
I just want to get a giant
family size box of White Castle.

01:13:23.235 --> 01:13:25.537
You know what women think? Let
me tell you what women think.

01:13:25.571 --> 01:13:27.072
Yeah, I love that.

01:13:27.072 --> 01:13:30.075
Women think that men on their
final nights of freedom

01:13:30.109 --> 01:13:31.610
they just want strippers
and beer

01:13:31.643 --> 01:13:34.613
but really, I just want
a place to fart endlessly

01:13:34.646 --> 01:13:36.849
into the sunset
without anybody knowing.

01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:39.184
-They say romance is dead but...
-Nope.

01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:41.854
-Proved me wrong.
-Not with me.

01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:43.722
Anyway. Should I keep this
clock?

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:46.258
Yeah.

01:13:48.427 --> 01:13:50.562
-Yeah.
-And...

01:13:50.596 --> 01:13:53.098
Let's start with these ones.

01:13:53.098 --> 01:13:54.233
[Peter] Oh, I need tape.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.571
-Is she coming today?
-No. No.

01:13:59.605 --> 01:14:01.440
I ended it with her
platonically.

01:14:02.474 --> 01:14:04.677
Oh. You didn't have to do that.

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:07.880
We are starting
a new chapter in our life.

01:14:07.913 --> 01:14:11.550
And when we are together,
not good.

01:14:11.583 --> 01:14:14.219
I don't want anything to
jeopardize what we have.

01:14:14.253 --> 01:14:16.288
-I love you.
-I love you too.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.292
-I need tape. Okay.
-Then get tape.

01:14:33.072 --> 01:14:34.073
[sighs]

01:14:42.348 --> 01:14:43.515
[knocking on door]

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:45.384
Lexa!

01:14:45.417 --> 01:14:47.353
[knocking on door]

01:14:47.386 --> 01:14:52.091
Lexa! Lexa!
I know you're in there.

01:14:52.124 --> 01:14:53.826
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:14:56.128 --> 01:14:58.097
Ta-da!

01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.531
I was at my bachelorette party.

01:15:00.499 --> 01:15:02.267
-You don't say.
-[Taylor] Yeah.

01:15:02.301 --> 01:15:05.137
[belches]

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:06.739
What is that?
What are you...

01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:10.209
[gulping]

01:15:10.242 --> 01:15:11.510
[inhales deeply]

01:15:11.543 --> 01:15:13.746
-Oh!
-I think I did it.

01:15:13.779 --> 01:15:15.914
-Wow!
-I can't marry Peter.

01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:20.085
[upbeat music]

01:15:20.119 --> 01:15:23.622
So, Taylor, as lovely as it is
to see you--

01:15:23.655 --> 01:15:26.925
-I needed to talk to someone.
-And you thought of me.

01:15:26.959 --> 01:15:28.494
[sobbing]

01:15:28.527 --> 01:15:32.698
-Oh!
-I broke him.

01:15:32.731 --> 01:15:37.369
When I met him, his kitchen
cabinets were filled with Legos

01:15:37.403 --> 01:15:39.071
and only two days ago

01:15:39.071 --> 01:15:42.541
his walls were covered
with unframed band posters.

01:15:42.574 --> 01:15:44.543
-Sounds about right.
-And now, no more Legos.

01:15:44.576 --> 01:15:47.646
-No more Sublime.
-I can buy you Sublime poster.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.517
I took this wonderful strange
man of a boy,

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.452
and I-I-I changed him.

01:15:53.485 --> 01:15:56.855
And he did and he was perfect
before.

01:15:56.889 --> 01:16:00.526
-He wasn't perfect.
-No, he was perfectly imperfect.

01:16:00.559 --> 01:16:03.829
And then I, I-I made him dull,
I made him like me.

01:16:03.862 --> 01:16:06.031
Oh, Taylor, look.
I barely know you.

01:16:06.031 --> 01:16:09.768
But I can say one thing for
certain is, you are not dull.

01:16:09.802 --> 01:16:11.537
Well, we're not fun like
you two.

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:14.707
Fun gets you sent to
Disneyland jail.

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.742
Look, when Peter and I
are together,

01:16:16.775 --> 01:16:19.678
we become the people
we were when we were 20.

01:16:19.712 --> 01:16:22.581
But the two of you,
when you're together,

01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:25.517
you make each other better.

01:16:25.551 --> 01:16:28.887
Do you think he's making
a mistake marrying me?

01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:31.223
You're putting me
in a really weird position.

01:16:31.256 --> 01:16:35.194
If the two of you get married,
I lose Peter forever.

01:16:35.227 --> 01:16:38.897
But if I stop thinking about
myself for like 30 seconds...

01:16:40.432 --> 01:16:43.068
I do think you two
belong together.

01:16:43.102 --> 01:16:46.572
[sighs] Really?

01:16:46.605 --> 01:16:49.441
Yeah, really.

01:16:49.475 --> 01:16:52.611
I really love you, I think.

01:16:52.644 --> 01:16:55.547
-Thank you. Oh! Hm!
-Be my maid of honor?

01:16:55.581 --> 01:16:57.116
[laughing]

01:16:57.149 --> 01:17:00.419
I think you belong together too,
like not romantically.

01:17:00.452 --> 01:17:03.522
'Cause, that would be weird.
But you know, as friends.

01:17:03.555 --> 01:17:06.325
You should stay friends because
just because I can't give him

01:17:06.358 --> 01:17:09.028
what you give him doesn't mean
that part of him should die.

01:17:09.028 --> 01:17:12.398
Yeah, well, uh, I dumped him
and he friend-dumped me. So...

01:17:12.431 --> 01:17:16.802
I'm gonna fix this, I'm gonna
throw up and I'm gonna fix it.

01:17:16.835 --> 01:17:21.040
What would you say if I wanted
to make out with you?

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.242
Huh, who?

01:17:23.275 --> 01:17:24.510
Okay, all right, hold on.

01:17:26.378 --> 01:17:28.847
[instrumental music]

01:17:56.275 --> 01:17:58.210
[music continues]

01:18:00.012 --> 01:18:03.382
-Wake up.
-What is it?

01:18:03.415 --> 01:18:05.017
You left a random woman
in my room.

01:18:05.017 --> 01:18:08.487
Yeah, she was too...
Uh, I'll take care of it.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.156
Don't bother. She's gone.

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:12.157
[phone dings]

01:18:19.365 --> 01:18:20.532
[sighs]

01:18:30.276 --> 01:18:32.812
-I don't know, it's kind of...
-He's got this.

01:18:32.846 --> 01:18:35.415
Ah, you want to protect your
face, bro?

01:18:39.152 --> 01:18:41.121
Okay, I'll, I'll be back.

01:18:42.555 --> 01:18:44.057
I can leave if you want me to.

01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:48.561
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:18:48.595 --> 01:18:51.831
Taylor told me about last night.
Thank you for talking her down.

01:18:51.865 --> 01:18:56.236
-It was nothing.
-Also... I'm sorry. I panicked.

01:18:56.269 --> 01:18:58.104
I thought I had to lose you
to save my relationship.

01:18:58.138 --> 01:19:00.407
-And I was a dick.
-You were.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.575
Do you wanna punch me
in the other eye?

01:19:02.609 --> 01:19:04.477
I feel really bad about that
so, I want to change

01:19:04.511 --> 01:19:05.679
the subject really quickly?

01:19:05.712 --> 01:19:08.014
Sorry, I missed
your bachelor party.

01:19:08.048 --> 01:19:10.684
Oh, it's okay, you were
uninvited by some jerk.

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:13.853
-Me, I was a jerk. You got that?
-No, yeah, I got that. Yeah.

01:19:13.887 --> 01:19:16.289
You missed quite a night, I mean
I can't remember most of it,

01:19:16.322 --> 01:19:18.191
but apparently I did a karaoke
duet version

01:19:18.224 --> 01:19:20.360
of <i>My Heart Will Go On</i>
with a stripper named Cobra.

01:19:20.393 --> 01:19:23.430
-A female stripper named Cobra?
-I'm not sure.

01:19:23.463 --> 01:19:27.534
-Yeah, undetermined. So...
-How you feeling?

01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:30.437
Honestly, I wasn't nervous until
I saw the church and everything.

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.939
-I'm nervous, whoo!
-You'll do great.

-You think so?
-Yeah. I know so.

01:19:36.509 --> 01:19:38.311
I want you to pay attention,
because what I'm about to

01:19:38.345 --> 01:19:40.447
tell you just might be the
greatest thing that anyone

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.216
has told another human being
in the history of this planet.

01:19:43.249 --> 01:19:45.051

Yes. No. Yes.

"I seen a lot of you people
hatin' me

"and I didn't know
what to feel about that,

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.670
so I guess they didn't like you
much not either."

01:20:03.703 --> 01:20:07.774
"During this fight, I've seen
a lot of changing,

01:20:07.807 --> 01:20:11.978
the way yous feel about me, and
in the way I felt about you."

if I can change,

then everybody can change!"
