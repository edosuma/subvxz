WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.008
<i>Previously, on Hit the Floor.</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:06.765
You were an original Devil Girl.
Coolest first job ever.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.097
- Babe? You're doing it?
- I don't know.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.478
You think you can come in here
and take one of our spots?

00:11.637 --> 00:15.312
It's only so long before even you realise
that you don't have what it takes.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.851
Did you think I was joking

00:17.017 --> 00:19.645
when I said I was lucky to get out of
there? That is a wild world, Ahsha!

00:19.811 --> 00:22.439
You have the talent to be the next Jelena.
That makes you a target.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.700
- Mia's gone? When?
- Last night.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.860
We have an addition
to our judges table for the finals,

00:27.027 --> 00:31.498
former Devil and brand-new
Devil's head coach, Pete Davenport.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.079
Didn't I hear your coach
say something

00:33.242 --> 00:35.085
about no messing around
between Devils and Devil Girls?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.338
- Technically, you're not a Devil Girl.
- I don't think my boyfriend cares

00:37.496 --> 00:39.214
about your technicalities.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.967
How can she get away with sleeping
with the players and no one else can?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.627
Different rules for different folk.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.756
- You're suing me?
- He needs a man in his life.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.720
- Full time.
- So find me one!

00:48.882 --> 00:50.225
- Sloane.
- Olivia.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.935
I'm kind of surprised
that you wanted her

00:52.094 --> 00:53.641
-to do this.
- This is all her.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.774
- Ahsha, don't be late.
- Oh, my God!

00:56.932 --> 00:58.229
I'm sorry, Raquel.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.690
You asked me to make a choice.
That was not the choice I made.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.854
- Ahsha was too good.
- So was Mia.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.154
What did I tell you about calling me?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.364
The point of you getting gone
was staying gone.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.529
- Listen. Be careful.
- I will.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.243
The girls are not my responsibility.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.331
Wrong. Ahsha is your responsibility.
She's your daughter.

02:07.002 --> 02:10.050
Am I packing too much for today?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.261
You might want to pack
a box of tissues.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.602
I've seen plenty of girls chewed up
and spit out by Devil Girls Boot Camp.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.684
Poof. Gone.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.692
I'm not saying I want that.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.153
You don't have to worry about me.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.867
I am your mother.
I would roll you up in bubble wrap

02:30.984 --> 02:33.078
and lock you in the basement
if I could.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.079
It's a good thing
we don't have a basement.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.712
"Okay!
_l_ley!

02:41.870 --> 02:44.464
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.834
- I meant this.
- Hey.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.632
- Okay!
- Don't forget to point your toes.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.053
- No one likes dead feet.
- Bye!

02:58.470 --> 03:00.268
Bye.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.315
Got my bubble wrap, right here.

03:14.236 --> 03:17.706
- I waited till she was gone.
- You came to my house?

03:17.823 --> 03:20.201
That's what happens when
you don't return my phone calls.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.165
You shouldn't have come.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.046
You shouldn't have dropped
that bomb on me and then gone AWOL.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.800
- I did not go AWOL.
- What do you call it, then, Sloane?

03:29.876 --> 03:33.551
Okay, you're right.
That whole thing was just...

03:35.132 --> 03:37.009
Look, I didn't go to the arena
to tell you,

03:37.175 --> 03:40.270
but you wouldn't do the one thing
I asked, Pete. You wouldn't help me.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.057
- What, I--
- No.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.183
I know it wasn't fair and I'm sorry.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.977
So let's just forget
it ever happened.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.900
- Forget it?
- Yeah.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.863
You've got your life.
We've got ours.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.075
Nothing has to change.
She's fine. We're fine.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.861
I'm not fine, Sloane.
We have a daughter.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.029
I have a daughter.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.123
- How could you not have told me?
- You know why.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.250
I'm late for work.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.220
Welcome to the Devil Girls.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.676
You thought tryouts were brutal,
you haven't seen anything yet.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.977
There are 41 home games per season,
not including the playoffs

05:02.135 --> 05:04.934
and the Devils always make
the playoffs.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.191
Add the dancing you'll be doing at public
appearances, charity events, etcetera,

05:08.350 --> 05:12.605
and by the end of the season,
you will hurt, a lot.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.025
Devil Girls aren't just artists,
we are athletes.

05:16.191 --> 05:20.788
We are also ambassadors,
representing the organisation 24/7.

05:20.904 --> 05:25.785
That means no hooking up
with any of the players.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.544
Or anyone in the front row.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.541
Any behaviour TMZ or TMZ-adjacent
and you're out.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.751
Opening game is in two days.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.670
Your first performance,
however, is in one.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.056
The invitation-only
pre-season kick-off party.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.558
Investors, politicians, celebrities,

05:41.716 --> 05:44.811
they all come here
to the Devil's Playground.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.564
- What's the Devil's Playground?
- The private club upstairs.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.941
You have to know Jesus or Oprah
to get on the guest list.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.446
Now, they're all coming to see
the new players and to see you.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.861
You need to be perfect.
You will be perfect.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.496
From the top.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.211
We've got such an awesome group
this season.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.471
They need work.

06:19.629 --> 06:23.634
- Are you still upset with me?
- What gave it away?

06:23.800 --> 06:27.100
So Ahsha's on the team. So what?
We've got 13 other girls.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.268
This isn't about Ahsha.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.809
This is about
you ignoring a simple request.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.694
Jelena, sometimes in life,
compromise is necessary.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.240
Well, I shouldn't have
to compromise on my team.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.777
Your team?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.660
I took shaking my ass in the second row
of a half-empty stadium

06:45.780 --> 06:48.158
and turned it into
a $50 million industry.

06:48.325 --> 06:52.375
Which I'm the face of and if you want
to keep raking in the cash--

06:52.537 --> 06:56.417
I don't need cash, Jelena.
I'm married to a Devil.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.842
What I need is a Captain who is not
gonna push back on everything I do.

07:01.004 --> 07:05.475
At some point, you're gonna have
to be happy with the team we've got.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.012
At some point, I will.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.068
We are making
so many public appearances.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.657
What's that?
Did they give that to you?

07:20.815 --> 07:24.069
Uh, no. This is my playbook.

07:26.738 --> 07:30.709
"Mario Consalvi,
Colonial State Street Bank.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.746
"$43 million, Sky BOX 113."

07:33.912 --> 07:38.042
VIP, line of business,
net worth, seat in the arena.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.881
What's that doodle?
Is that a magic wand?

07:45.048 --> 07:48.268
It's a whip.
I like to draw the fetishes myself.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.148
And what are you gonna do with that?

07:53.306 --> 07:56.310
I'm a Devil Girl now.
I'll never pay my own rent again.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.031
Jelena?

08:09.197 --> 08:12.622
I just wanted to say I'm not going
to be any trouble to you.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.619
I'm just here to dance, that's all.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.591
That was me hazing. I'm sorry.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.968
Devil Girls have to be tough.

08:22.127 --> 08:25.427
But we are all Devil Girls now.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.590
We're cool. If you're cool with me?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.303
Yeah. Of course.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.857
Out with the old,
in with the new.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.763
I thought you'd be tired
of dancers by now.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.302
No, no, I'm just...

09:12.469 --> 09:16.099
You know, I was with them
during tryouts. I guess I'm invested.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.020
Coach Davenport,

09:18.141 --> 09:22.021
I just wanted to say thank you
for putting me on the team.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.819
I promise I will never be late again.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.827
That must have been strange.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.294
Seeing Sloane. I saw you
talking to her the other day.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.922
Oh, it was fine.

09:42.957 --> 09:47.053
- I better get off to practice.
- Sure.

09:59.057 --> 10:04.484
Terrence, Derek, you guys made
the playoffs the last two years.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.774
So what?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.365
Making the playoffs
was never good enough for me

10:10.527 --> 10:14.498
and it can't be good enough
for you two either.

10:15.490 --> 10:19.620
Look, I have a lot
riding on this season

10:19.744 --> 10:22.748
and I know you two have a lot
riding on this season too.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.298
Whatever we've got going on
in our lives,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.304
we need to check that
at the door.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.767
While we're in this arena,
we need to be totally focused.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.270
I can do that. Can you?

10:42.267 --> 10:43.644
Hell, yeah.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.571
Absolutely.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.447
All right.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.448
Oscar is buying you all
new uniforms, as you know.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.458
All that he asks,
all the old ones be turned in.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.961
Thank you. Thank you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.584
Tighter is righter.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.094
Hey, what do we have to do
to get tickets to opening game?

11:10.253 --> 11:13.678
Well, it depends on who
you're willing to slap and tickle.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.434
It's for my boyfriend, so no one.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.847
- You have a boyfriend?
- What?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.732
Tick-took, Care Bear.
Boyfriends don't last long in this world.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.189
He'll be gone by the All-Star game,
mark my words.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.024
Why would you say that?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.781
Look, I'm not trying to be mean,
I'm just, you know, giving you facts.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.033
Well, German and I have been together
through college

11:32.192 --> 11:34.365
and he couldn't be
more excited for me.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.404
It's like you stepped out
of a Judy Blume novel

11:36.571 --> 11:37.868
and you are baiting me
to worry about you,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.454
but it's not gonna work.
I am not here to get my wings.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.289
Looking good, ladies.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.924
You' self-conscious
around little 0l' me?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.554
No, just cold.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.260
Well, maybe dancing
will warm you up.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.099
Maybe. Let's see it.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.101
You want to see me dance,
I'll dance for you.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.937
This guy might be able
to get you a ticket to the game.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.144
Oh, you need a ticket?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.518
For who, your big baller boyfriend?

12:06.684 --> 12:09.107
Yes, for my big baller boyfriend.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.274
Well, tell him not to worry. I'll look
after you. He can watch me on TV.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.740
Won't you be too busy
gawking at yourself?

12:15.860 --> 12:19.239
It's quitting time. I should be
getting home to my man now.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.748
Excuse me.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.838
You ever drive a man crazy
just by saying no?

12:26.996 --> 12:28.998
I never say no.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.223
<i>Here comes Willard
the other way, takes it himself.</i>

12:37.340 --> 12:40.310
<i>- Crossover, left side.</i>
- Pass <i>the</i> ball!

12:44.722 --> 12:48.602
I have floor burns in places
I didn't even know existed

12:48.768 --> 12:51.237
and I think I dislocated
my shoulder.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.697
Today was perfect.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.657
Were any of the players there?

12:58.820 --> 13:02.040
- They were around.
- Come here.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.750
I'm sorry.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.753
Gosh, Ahsha, you are so amazing.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.542
I mean, when I got scouted,
I cracked.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.087
Yeah, but you, you're doing this.

13:15.253 --> 13:20.305
We're doing this, you and me.
We're in this together.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.219
I just can't wait to come see you
at opening game.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.847
We don't actually get tickets
to opening game.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.602
Well, at least I get to be your date
for that kick-off party

13:30.768 --> 13:33.237
that you told me about, right?

13:33.396 --> 13:36.115
We don't actually get tickets
to that, either.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.449
Well, at least I have you now.

13:40.611 --> 13:45.333
That's not all you have.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.877
The little outfit for me, girl?
Yeah, babe.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.383
Come here!

13:56.252 --> 13:58.004
I thought you said
you had to turn that in.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.720
I did.
I found this one in the locker room.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.351
Thought you might want
to get a little use out of it.

14:03.509 --> 14:08.356
Oh, yeah. You are never giving
that back. You know that, right?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.892
You know that, right?
You know that, right?

14:11.059 --> 14:14.438
- You're bad!
- Come here, girl!

14:44.801 --> 14:47.429
Pull in a little tighter
on that smile.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.189
A little bigger. Good, good.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.409
These go up on the Jumbotron.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.820
Is there lipstick on my teeth?

15:04.946 --> 15:08.996
Okay, girls, group photo.
Are we ready?

15:09.158 --> 15:12.128
This is gonna be on everything,
from programmes and magazines

15:12.286 --> 15:14.084
to billboards and bus stops,

15:14.247 --> 15:18.047
and attached to every piece
of merchandise we sell.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.462
Let's make magic.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.730
Rookies in the back.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.060
It's good to see you, Raquel.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.947
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.696
I heard things have gotten worse
with Jesse.

16:31.949 --> 16:35.544
Hey. I'd really like to help.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.334
Know where I can find a job?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.547
- I might, actually.
- I didn't mean literally.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.839
The hostess job at the Devil's Playground
just opened up. It's a really great gig.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.299
I could make a call--

16:48.424 --> 16:51.098
Thanks, but I can figure
this out on my own.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.980
I know you can.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.402
Well, the manager's there now,

16:59.560 --> 17:02.985
if you just happen
to be walking that way.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.790
You need to take that one down.
Do you see that stray hair?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.469
So many new comments.

17:24.585 --> 17:28.055
Do people think I just sit around
reading all of these?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.278
How do you delete this?

17:58.744 --> 18:01.873
I've sat through enough
of my wife's jerk-off charity events

18:02.039 --> 18:04.212
to recognise what
bored stupid looks like.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.300
I'm not bored, Oscar,
I'm just distracted.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.594
What could be bigger than tonight?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.264
Tomorrow's game day.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.479
It's the first day
of my professional coaching career.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.435
Your job starts tonight.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.817
This party is packed
with investors, politicians

18:20.975 --> 18:25.071
and what our Vice-President of Public
Relations informs me are celebrities.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.073
Look, everybody's gonna want
a piece of you, okay?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.030
Lots of handshakes, big smiles

18:30.192 --> 18:32.615
and you're peeing with excitement
about the new season.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.701
Don't sweat it, Oscar.
I know the drill.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.826
- I'm ready.
- You better be.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.847
Welcome to the Devil's Playground.

18:52.006 --> 18:56.477
Ladies, gentlemen, are you ready
for this season's Devil Girls?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.556
Let's show them how we do it, girls.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.267
Baby. That dance was...

21:09.685 --> 21:12.313
If it isn't page 13 in my binder.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.154
Teddy Reynolds.
His daddy owns a movie studio.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.990
His granddaddy pretty much
invented colour TV.

21:18.152 --> 21:22.498
He, on the other hand, hasn't done
anything with his life...yet.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.785
Terrence. Terrence, over here, buddy.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.953
- Terrence.
- Big fan, huh?

21:28.120 --> 21:32.546
Oh, no. We go way back. I just wanted
to get a picture of us for my Twitter.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.085
He can retweet it to his followers

21:34.251 --> 21:36.629
and I can retweet
his retweet to my followers,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.218
and we can kind of hashtag it
back and forth

21:38.380 --> 21:40.599
and our fans can subscribe to it,
and we can "like" it

21:40.758 --> 21:45.104
and check into it on Tumblr,
MySpace...

21:45.221 --> 21:48.441
Did you hit the medicine cabinet
on your way here?

21:48.599 --> 21:51.227
Can you get me close
for a picture?

21:51.393 --> 21:55.318
Sweetheart, you can get a picture
of Terrence Wall anywhere.

21:55.481 --> 21:59.076
How would you like a once-in-a-lifetime
Devils experience

21:59.235 --> 22:02.409
you'll be telling
your grandbabies about?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.118
I am intrigued.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.827
Follow me.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.797
Hi. Sure.

22:17.962 --> 22:22.809
- Raquel!
- Ahsha! Wow! Look at you!

22:22.967 --> 22:25.720
Look at you!
What are you doing here?

22:25.886 --> 22:30.733
I'm working here, for now.
I'm the new hostess.

22:30.891 --> 22:34.236
So that means I get to see you
all the time? That's amazing.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.406
Here we go again.

22:47.366 --> 22:51.212
I can't. He's literally walking in
with bitches and hoes.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.800
Not tonight.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.961
Oh, God.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.007
That guy is so mean to you.
What did you do to him?

23:02.172 --> 23:04.015
When I caught him
cheating on me,

23:04.174 --> 23:09.351
I went a little Carrie Underwood
on his Lamborghini Murcielago.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.515
That doesn't seem like you at all.

23:11.682 --> 23:15.061
Yeah, well,
I was nine months pregnant.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.233
I was a little emotional.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.694
I'll be over... Yeah.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.958
My cocktail waitress fantasy
come true.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.414
In your fantasy
does your cocktail waitress

23:31.577 --> 23:33.500
want to choke you
until you pass out?

23:33.621 --> 23:35.999
Yeah, she could.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.963
Unfortunately, for the both of us,

23:38.125 --> 23:40.469
I'm not a waitress.
I'm the hostess.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.756
So you're not a whore.
You're the madam.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.348
Don't get me wrong, anything that
keeps you off the pole, I'm all for.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.854
Still, it's not really a place you
can take a four year old to, is it?

23:51.013 --> 23:53.641
Good thing I was able to step in
and help out when I did.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.903
Help? Is that what you call taking
a little boy away from his mother?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.611
Jesse, you may be
a big-time agent,

24:01.774 --> 24:03.902
but you are a small, small man.

24:05.069 --> 24:08.243
My client Derek needs bottle service.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.079
Why don't you dance it
over to him, eh?

24:21.669 --> 24:24.843
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.809
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

24:28.968 --> 24:31.892
I'm having sex
inside Terrence Wall's locker!

24:32.054 --> 24:34.056
Inside Terrence Wall's locker.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.559
Less narrating
and more gyrating, honey.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.602
I'm close and so is security.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.824
Derek.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.579
Those your sisters?

24:52.700 --> 24:55.579
Girls are like Jordans,
you can never have too many.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.377
- Whoa. Hey.
- Hey, Coach.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.883
Just gonna walk by
and not give me hug?

25:01.041 --> 25:04.261
It looks like you've got
your hands full already.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.228
I saw her first, Coach.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.402
- Hell0?
- We need to talk.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.991
- Pete, I said--
- Yeah, I know what you said.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.828
- Okay. I'm coming over.
- You are not coming over.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.085
- Sloane, I am on the edge here.
- Call me tomorrow.

25:36.243 --> 25:40.339
No, you're not listening to me.
I need to see you now, right now.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.420
<i>Or would you rather I go back
inside this kick-off party</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:44.794
<i>and have a couple drinks, get
real chatty? Because I could do that.</i>

25:44.960 --> 25:48.214
- That's not funny.
- I am dead serious.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.848
I'll come there.

26:08.442 --> 26:12.868
- Thank you.
- Ahsha, you were so great up there.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.500
- You could see me in the back?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

26:16.658 --> 26:20.083
- I started off in the back too.
- Was my mom in the back?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.714
Your mom? No.

26:22.873 --> 26:25.717
No, your mom was always
right up in the front.

26:25.876 --> 26:31.133
You have so much of her in your eyes
and the way you move, it's...

26:31.298 --> 26:34.427
- You were friends.
- She told you that?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.436
No, just guessed.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.104
Best friends.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.821
- Raquel.
- Jelena.

26:55.197 --> 26:58.576
I'm glad to see
you landed on your feet.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.828
Devil Girls have to be tough, right?

27:06.208 --> 27:07.960
This was delivered here for you.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.839
- To the Playground?
- Excuse me.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.775
You okay, babe?

27:27.938 --> 27:32.785
Of course. I have to go fix my makeup.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.279
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.
- Okay.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.339
I got the plans for the new arena.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.421
It's gonna make the Barclays Center
look like <i>Little</i> House on the Prairie.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.544
The city's never gonna let you
into Hollywood.

27:50.711 --> 27:54.056
-It's too congested as it is.
- You let me worry about that.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.396
Hey, hey, hey, great to see you.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.604
<i>Bret Locke“,
the best safety 'm the NFL.</i>

28:07.477 --> 28:09.479
- You taking off?
- Yeah, man.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.866
As soon as Jelena gets back. You
might want to head out too, brother.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.361
- The party just started.
- Come on, D.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.155
You partied enough
last season, don't you think?

28:19.656 --> 28:22.000
- You the coach?
- No, I'm not.

28:22.159 --> 28:25.003
Just a man that wants a ring
and I would have got one last season

28:25.162 --> 28:27.335
but my team mate ran out of gas
in the playoffs.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.591
Do you want to compare stats?

28:29.750 --> 28:32.469
It's not about stats.
It's about championships.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.465
Maybe you want one of those.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.687
I do kick box cardio at the gym,
but this guy was a big guy.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.602
Barn, he goes down
like a sack of spuds.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.146
- How's everyone doing?
- Hey!

28:50.312 --> 28:52.906
This is the one
I was telling you about.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.994
Don't you want to know
what I told them?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.826
I have a lot of people
I have to take care of tonight.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.241
That's what I told them!

29:07.955 --> 29:10.253
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

29:10.415 --> 29:13.043
- Oh, my God, I'm...
- Jesus.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.089
- What, are you insane?
- I'm so sorry.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.430
Jeez, this is a new suit!

29:23.553 --> 29:25.476
That's very funny, isn't it?

29:33.981 --> 29:36.905
Where are all your lady friends?
Did they get called into surgery?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.709
Okay, so I kind of don't know
what to do here.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.619
Usually, you hit on me,

29:47.786 --> 29:50.790
I spray you with a water bottle
and then I walk away.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.334
Are you (Wing?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.502
It's Terrence. He's riding me.

30:00.549 --> 30:05.225
You know, Jelena was riding me,
but we're cool now. It'll pass.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.849
You think so?

30:09.016 --> 30:11.986
Well, if you'd stop acting
like an ass.

30:16.606 --> 30:19.155
All right. You know...

30:21.445 --> 30:24.619
Call this dude.
He'll hook you up with a ticket.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.538
A ticket to opening game?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.498
You don't have one, right?

30:28.660 --> 30:31.630
You know this is
for my boyfriend, right?

30:31.788 --> 30:34.962
Look, don't tell anybody.
Got an image to protect.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.519
- You couldn't come inside?
- No, I couldn't come inside.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.029
- Have you lost your mind?
- I can't stand this.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.316
My players are hitting on her.

31:41.691 --> 31:44.695
People think I'm a creep
because I'm staring at her.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.494
She talked to me today, Sloane.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.579
- I have to tell her.
- Okay. Okay.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.832
- Here's why you can't say anything.
- Sloane--

31:52.994 --> 31:54.587
No, Pete, hear me out.

31:55.831 --> 31:59.005
Ahsha does not know this world,
not like you and I do.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.261
It's not easy. You know what I mean.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.841
Now, if she finds out about this,

32:06.007 --> 32:08.226
it'll tear her away from me
just when she needs me the most.

32:08.343 --> 32:12.644
It'll spin her out and this is not the
world she should be spinning out in.

32:12.806 --> 32:17.277
So what am I supposed to do?
Just pretend she doesn't exist?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.359
Like she's just some other girl
running around the arena?

32:19.521 --> 32:24.368
No. Not forever. Just, let her
get her legs here, okay?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.654
- And then we'll figure it out.
- Sloane-

32:26.820 --> 32:29.323
Not now.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.119
Pete, you owe me.

32:37.789 --> 32:41.589
Okay. We'll do it your way.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.466
I won't tell Ahsha
that I'm her father, for now.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.552
Thank you.

33:03.273 --> 33:04.616
Four hours, I'm gonna be dancing

33:04.774 --> 33:07.027
inside of Devils Arena
in front of 20,000 people!

33:07.194 --> 33:08.787
Don't forget all the people
watching on TV.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.750
'Cause you know I can't wait
to be screaming, that's my girl!

33:12.866 --> 33:15.085
Get up! Work, work, work!

33:15.243 --> 33:18.042
Baby, give me a sign when you out there,
a little something special for me.

33:18.205 --> 33:21.584
I could wiggle my ear.
Or I could tap my wrist.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.629
- Nice.
- Or I could pull on my...

33:26.379 --> 33:28.552
Where's my badge?
I can't get in without it.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.934
My badge. I left it right here.
Can you go check my bedroom?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.060
Yeah, of course, babe.

33:37.474 --> 33:41.069
Are you kidding me?
A courtside seat, baby?

33:41.228 --> 33:45.108
You got me a courtside seat?
Where? How?

33:45.273 --> 33:48.743
I got the hook-up, baby. Do you need
to do your makeup or can we go?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.079
Of course not!

33:51.238 --> 33:52.990
You are gonna be beautiful.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.336
Go, go, go!

34:01.957 --> 34:04.961
Yes! Do you!

35:00.265 --> 35:02.643
- You excited?
- Yes! Yes I am!

35:02.809 --> 35:04.561
I'm really excited.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.618
- Who's that?
- That's Kyle.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.325
- She's on the team.
- She almost hit us, man.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.334
- When did you get a new car?
- Teddy Reynolds bought it for me.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.656
Nothing like getting fondled by the nacho
cheese-covered fingers of America.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.992
I saw Raquel
at the Devils Playground.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.956
Yeah, she's working there now.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.120
I can't help but think she got an assist

36:04.287 --> 36:06.289
in making her way
back into Devils Arena.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.003
So what?

36:08.166 --> 36:11.796
So that's something you could have
run by me, don't you think?

36:13.880 --> 36:18.260
That's it. I've had enough. Who goes,
who stays, who comes back.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.769
How you've got something to say
about everything

36:19.928 --> 36:21.601
and I've been listening to it
for way too long.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.482
- Oh, have you?
-lhave.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.439
You need to understand
something, Jelena.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.649
I'm the boss around here, not you.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.193
Director, Captain.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.951
Any confusion about that
is my fault, but that is so over.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.784
Sadly, the same can't be said
for this speech.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.499
Things are gonna change
around here.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.160
There are gonna be things
that happen that you might not like

36:43.326 --> 36:44.953
and you're just gonna have
to deal with them.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.839
Things? Such as?

36:49.541 --> 36:51.509
Ahsha will be dancing
in the front tonight.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.388
That's not how we do things.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.260
There's no "we" anymore.

37:05.807 --> 37:09.232
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Devils Arena opening day,</i>

37:09.394 --> 37:12.614
<i>where your Los Angeles Devils
take on Indiana.</i>

37:31.833 --> 37:35.633
<i>Devil, Devil, Devil, Devil Girls!</i>

37:38.339 --> 37:40.717
- Line up.
- Let's do this.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.181
Your first game as coach.
Don't piss yourself.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.809
- All right, girls, ready?
- Ahsha!

37:48.975 --> 37:52.980
- Watch out, man. Ahsha, baby.
- Babe.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.108
Baby, I just wanted to give you
something for luck.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.527
Babe, you need to get out there before
someone steals that courtside seat.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.037
- Okay, okay, good luck.
- Love you. Bye, bye!

38:07.952 --> 38:11.422
I don't know how you're holding
yourself together right now.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.213
Jelena Howard cannot be nervous.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.548
Not for me, for you.

38:17.587 --> 38:21.057
It's one thing to perform
in front of this crowd,

38:21.216 --> 38:24.390
but to perform in front
of your daddy too?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.429
My What?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.525
Pete Davenport, your father.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.739
Your mom danced for him back
in the day and now it's your turn.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.615
<i>-It's almost poetic.
- Devil Girls!</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:44.326
Let's go. Let's kick ass.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.503
Ahsha.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.544
<i>Next time on Hit The Floor.</i>

38:57.710 --> 39:01.055
- I've been a bad boyfriend.
- Very, very bad.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.091
- You told her?
- She knows?

39:04.759 --> 39:06.557
Party at the suite.
On me, let's go!

39:06.719 --> 39:09.188
- Yahtzee!
- Somebody get me a redhead.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.852
It's getting real old
cleaning up your messes, man.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.109
- I will find out what happened.
- You should.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.611
- That is weird.
- What?

39:14.769 --> 39:17.067
Mia, I just got an email from her
with a telephone number.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.025
Ahsha, what are you doing here?
The game's on.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.410
Is it true?

39:23.111 --> 39:24.454
Hi.
