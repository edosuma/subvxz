00:00.001 --> 00:02.320
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:02.323 --> 00:03.961
- Help!
- That's why we're here.

00:03.965 --> 00:05.129
To save his life.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.997
His name is Nicholas Keynes.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.175
- Where am I?
- You're with Rittenhouse.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.220
In the year 2018.

00:11.223 --> 00:13.638
- And who are you?
- I'm your granddaughter.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.820
Your mother's Rittenhouse?

00:14.823 --> 00:17.504
You have come so far
these past few weeks, Lucy.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.554
I'm proud of you.

00:18.557 --> 00:20.224
Be with us, be on the
right side of history.

00:20.226 --> 00:22.231
This is so much bigger than you or me.

00:22.234 --> 00:24.334
Mom.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.069
Mom!

00:27.706 --> 00:29.439
Jiya.

00:29.441 --> 00:32.042
The mother ship visited
ten different destinations.

00:32.043 --> 00:34.311
History could've changed
and we wouldn't even know it.

00:34.313 --> 00:36.079
I've been reading these plans they have.

00:36.081 --> 00:38.248
Key moments in history
to change the present.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.417
The captain, 1918, he worked
his way up through the ranks.

00:40.419 --> 00:42.585
Emma, she'd been in the
late 1800s for ten years.

00:42.587 --> 00:44.013
I mean, what if they've already planted

00:44.015 --> 00:45.655
who knows how many agents in history?

00:45.657 --> 00:47.700
Was there anything in there
about a Nicholas Keynes?

00:47.703 --> 00:51.027
These plans, this manifesto,
Nicholas Keynes wrote it.

00:51.029 --> 00:53.906
- Something's happened.
- I'll only talk to Lucy.

01:13.251 --> 01:18.021
What're you doing up already?

01:18.023 --> 01:21.691
You know that track like
the palm of your hand.

01:21.693 --> 01:24.260
Turn three's got a weird camber to it.

01:24.262 --> 01:25.729
Would be a good place to pass if

01:25.731 --> 01:27.254
Jimmy or Wendell makes a run on me.

01:27.257 --> 01:30.400
- Quit your worrying.
- Not worrying.

01:30.402 --> 01:32.502
Planning.

01:32.504 --> 01:33.603
Well.

01:34.639 --> 01:37.507
Then let's plan together.

01:58.163 --> 02:00.430
Didn't realize he was married.

02:00.432 --> 02:03.533
Two caskets instead of one?

02:03.535 --> 02:06.336
Three, counting the bun in the oven.

02:11.443 --> 02:15.111
Drive faster.

02:18.183 --> 02:20.850
Okay, output?

02:20.852 --> 02:23.286
- Still 14.4.
- Damn it.

02:23.288 --> 02:25.789
I'd have to rip up the
whole board and start again.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.091
Hand me the T10 Torx.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.333
It's not real.

02:37.335 --> 02:39.302
It's not real, it's
not real, it's not real.

02:39.304 --> 02:40.789
Jiya.

02:40.872 --> 02:42.454
Jiya.

02:45.811 --> 02:47.877
You okay?

02:47.879 --> 02:51.347
Yeah, totally fine.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.559
A little light reading, huh?

03:02.561 --> 03:05.662
Oh, just Rittenhouse's
creepy cult manifesto.

03:05.664 --> 03:06.930
That stuff's crazy.

03:06.932 --> 03:08.882
Crazy my mother believes in.

03:12.871 --> 03:14.507
Can I ask you something?

03:19.211 --> 03:21.678
What'd they do to you in there?

03:21.680 --> 03:23.246
Nothing to talk about.

03:23.248 --> 03:24.714
Which is why you're
staring at the ceiling

03:24.716 --> 03:27.550
all night every night?

03:27.552 --> 03:29.203
Your roommate Jiya sold you out.

03:29.206 --> 03:32.403
- So she's spying on me?
- She's worried about you.

03:32.406 --> 03:35.640
We all are.

03:35.643 --> 03:39.312
I appreciate everyone's concern, but

03:39.315 --> 03:41.949
I'm fine.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.645
What do you mean there's nothing?

03:47.648 --> 03:49.439
I mean nothing.

03:49.441 --> 03:53.176
The mother ship landed in the
South Carolina sticks, 1955.

03:53.178 --> 03:55.745
Nothing historical, no one
important there by a long shot.

03:55.747 --> 03:57.580
What if they're looking for someone

03:57.582 --> 03:59.782
- before they became important?
- So, then what?

03:59.784 --> 04:01.718
We just pick a direction
and start walking?

04:01.720 --> 04:02.734
I have an idea.

04:02.737 --> 04:04.234
I mean, you're gonna hate it,

04:04.237 --> 04:05.955
but we do have someone
who could help us,

04:05.957 --> 04:10.093
who know more about
Rittenhouse than we do.

04:10.095 --> 04:12.195
- Who?
- She's talking about Flynn.

04:12.197 --> 04:13.140
Mm, mm-mm.

04:13.143 --> 04:15.197
And "hate" does not
begin to touch how I feel

04:15.200 --> 04:16.199
about that idea.

04:16.201 --> 04:17.333
Number one, he's a psycho.

04:17.334 --> 04:18.735
Number two, he's a total psycho.

04:18.737 --> 04:20.403
And number three, he thinks he's in jail

04:20.404 --> 04:22.739
- 'cause we set him up.
- Well, we did set him up.

04:22.741 --> 04:25.408
More you than us, but, yeah.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.809
Who... who's counting?

04:26.811 --> 04:28.144
He said that he would only talk to me,

04:28.146 --> 04:29.412
so why not talk to him?

04:29.414 --> 04:30.813
Because he's unhinged.

04:30.815 --> 04:32.335
We can't trust a word he says.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.893
Okay, well, if anyone has a better idea,

04:34.896 --> 04:37.197
say it.

04:58.810 --> 05:02.679
No offense, Lucy, but
you have looked better.

05:02.681 --> 05:06.583
Rittenhouse has gone
to South Carolina, 1995.

05:06.585 --> 05:09.185
Any idea why?

05:09.187 --> 05:12.055
Maybe you should ask
your mother for help?

05:12.057 --> 05:14.157
It came up during our interrogation.

05:14.159 --> 05:15.856
You never suspected she was Rittenhouse?

05:15.859 --> 05:16.926
Your own mother?

05:16.928 --> 05:17.994
Are you gonna tell us what they're doing

05:17.996 --> 05:19.375
in South Carolina or not?

05:19.378 --> 05:21.965
Well, if you get me out of
here, then maybe we can talk.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.382
You know that's impossible.

05:23.385 --> 05:25.168
Well, then it's
impossible for me to help.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.136
I wanna finish what we started.

05:27.138 --> 05:28.871
I wanna take down Rittenhouse for good.

05:28.873 --> 05:32.475
Oh, please, you stopped me
from taking down Rittenhouse

05:32.477 --> 05:33.977
over and over again.

05:33.979 --> 05:36.270
Not anymore. I'll do
whatever it takes now.

05:36.273 --> 05:37.513
Really?

05:37.515 --> 05:39.482
What, you're gonna kill your own mother?

05:39.484 --> 05:41.417
Your hero

05:41.419 --> 05:43.820
who secretly groomed you,

05:43.822 --> 05:45.703
programmed you since you were a child

05:45.706 --> 05:47.290
to become one of them?

05:47.292 --> 05:50.325
And you blindly obeyed your whole life,

05:50.328 --> 05:53.363
begging for her approval like a lap dog.

05:53.365 --> 05:57.726
I'm sorry, Lucy, but it just
doesn't inspire confidence.

06:00.572 --> 06:02.739
They murdered your wife and daughter.

06:02.741 --> 06:04.540
You wanna avenge their deaths?

06:04.542 --> 06:08.578
You can help us or you can
keep being a smug, stubborn ass

06:08.580 --> 06:13.583
and rot knowing that
their deaths were in vain.

06:13.585 --> 06:18.921
There was a South Carolina
address on a Rittenhouse agent

06:18.923 --> 06:20.356
I killed.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.859
145 Fuller St.

06:22.861 --> 06:27.096
And I think the city
was called Darlington.

06:27.098 --> 06:30.099
That's all I have.

06:30.101 --> 06:32.535
This one's free.

06:32.537 --> 06:35.371
The next one will cost you.

06:43.924 --> 06:45.570
These clothes are from Old Navy.

06:45.573 --> 06:48.217
Yeah and the badge looks like
it's from the 99 cent store.

06:48.219 --> 06:50.453
Yes, wardrobe and
props are of necessity.

06:50.456 --> 06:52.140
A little barebones at the moment,

06:52.143 --> 06:54.891
due to financial constraints,
but hey, luckily for you,

06:54.893 --> 06:56.793
"Rebel Without a Cause"
made jeans and T-shirts

06:56.795 --> 06:58.461
perpetually cool. You'll blend right in.

06:58.463 --> 07:00.192
What did you find out
about 145 Fuller St.?

07:00.195 --> 07:01.497
Just a house.

07:01.499 --> 07:05.168
In 1955 it was owned
by a Ryan Millerson.

07:05.170 --> 07:06.736
Wait.

07:06.738 --> 07:08.304
The Ryan Millerson?

07:08.306 --> 07:10.106
- Who's that?
- Are you kidding?

07:10.108 --> 07:12.809
He's like one of the greatest
NASCAR drivers of all time.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.812
NASCAR? Yeah, not my sport.

07:15.814 --> 07:18.247
He wins the first Daytona 500 in 59.

07:18.249 --> 07:20.750
He's up there with guys
like Lee Petty and...

07:20.752 --> 07:24.520
And Junior Johnson and Tim Flock.

07:24.522 --> 07:27.256
Oh, you guys really are coastal elites.

07:27.258 --> 07:30.827
Why would Rittenhouse target
a NASCAR driver in the 50s?

07:30.829 --> 07:33.830
Well, we're about to find out.

07:37.836 --> 07:40.670
Jiya.

07:56.262 --> 07:59.463
Nicholas?

07:59.466 --> 08:02.867
How are you feeling?

08:02.870 --> 08:06.770
We've, uh, followed
your writings to the T.

08:06.772 --> 08:09.807
Planted sleeper agents
in different decades.

08:19.978 --> 08:23.947
This is Wikipedia.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.482
How much did you print out?

08:25.485 --> 08:27.487
- All of it.
- All of it?

08:27.490 --> 08:30.093
Scribed by your mechanical printmaker.

08:30.096 --> 08:32.456
Yes, but this... this tablet

08:32.458 --> 08:34.465
that I showed you, this
would make things a lot...

08:34.467 --> 08:37.456
It strains my eyes.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.058
I don't know how you people
stare at those glowing windows

08:40.062 --> 08:42.529
all day long.

08:42.532 --> 08:45.642
Do you recognize her?

08:48.547 --> 08:50.514
It's my mother.

08:50.516 --> 08:54.118
My daughter. Your mother.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.122
To me she's just a baby.

08:58.124 --> 09:02.359
But...

09:02.361 --> 09:04.928
time is a funny thing.

09:04.930 --> 09:08.465
Nicholas, we've been
waiting for your guidance.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.760
Where is the Victrola I requested?

09:10.763 --> 09:13.830
The, uh, hundred-year-old
record player?

09:13.833 --> 09:15.505
We're having a hard time tracking one.

09:15.508 --> 09:19.209
I want what I'm used to.

09:22.281 --> 09:25.682
- A list of songs.
- For the phonograph.

09:25.684 --> 09:28.819
Okay.

09:28.821 --> 09:31.088
And more pickled eggs.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.290
Sooner than later.

09:33.292 --> 09:37.094
Pickled eggs.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.401
Well, I'll tell ya, y'all
don't look like any reporters

09:44.403 --> 09:46.103
I've ever seen.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.667
Well, we're from California.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.539
California. It's a shame he missed you.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.108
He would've loved talking to y'all.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.544
You said Ryan's at
the track? To practice.

09:53.546 --> 09:55.412
Not to practice, no, to race.

09:55.414 --> 09:56.914
Today's the Darlington 500,

09:56.916 --> 09:59.216
that's why you're here, isn't it?

09:59.218 --> 10:01.185
Yeah, that is why we're here.

10:01.187 --> 10:02.786
Well, if you hurry, you might even beat

10:02.788 --> 10:04.154
your competition to him.

10:04.156 --> 10:05.401
Competition?

10:05.404 --> 10:07.924
Two other reporters were
here about an hour ago.

10:07.927 --> 10:10.194
And I will tell you the
same thing I told them,

10:10.196 --> 10:11.596
Ryan's gonna win it for sure.

10:11.599 --> 10:13.363
You can print that in
your papers right now.

10:13.365 --> 10:14.526
I will.

10:14.529 --> 10:15.866
You mind telling us what these

10:15.868 --> 10:17.033
other reporters looked like?

10:17.036 --> 10:19.276
The man was very serious,
and the woman, well,

10:19.279 --> 10:20.879
red hair and a lot of freckles.

10:20.882 --> 10:24.041
God's kisses, right? Right.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.477
Oh, do... do you know her?

10:26.479 --> 10:28.078
Yes, uh,

10:28.080 --> 10:30.781
more of a professional
rival, if you will.

10:43.128 --> 10:46.430
Get your popcorn here.

10:51.770 --> 10:56.440
Oh, man, that's a 49 Ford sedan.

10:56.442 --> 10:59.276
48 Ford Super Deluxe
with an inline six.

11:02.014 --> 11:05.749
These are original stock
cars, no restorations.

11:09.288 --> 11:10.888
- What?
- Nothing.

11:10.890 --> 11:13.223
Just didn't realize you
were such a stone cold nerd.

11:13.225 --> 11:14.391
Yeah, me neither.

11:14.393 --> 11:15.789
So what do you think Rittenhouse

11:15.792 --> 11:16.839
wants with the race?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.495
Covering the market on
country western songs?

11:18.497 --> 11:19.922
First order of business,
we gotta find Ryan

11:19.924 --> 11:21.098
before Rittenhouse does.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.533
His garage has to be
around here somewhere.

11:22.535 --> 11:24.501
Excuse me, boy.

11:24.503 --> 11:27.437
No, sorry. Excuse me.

11:27.439 --> 11:29.606
Ugh, 1955 in the South.

11:29.608 --> 11:31.508
Not exactly a prime
place for black folk.

11:39.685 --> 11:41.184
Tell that to him.

11:41.186 --> 11:43.820
- That's...
- Wendell Scott.

11:43.822 --> 11:46.189
Why'd you hit my boy?

11:46.191 --> 11:49.126
Son of a...

11:49.128 --> 11:50.427
I was talking to you.

11:50.429 --> 11:53.130
No, no, not toward the fighting.

11:53.132 --> 11:55.299
Why'd you hit my boy?

11:55.301 --> 11:57.734
Caught your dumbass
boy mucking in my engine

11:57.736 --> 11:59.299
so I laid him out.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.539
- Got a feeling you sent him.
- And why would I do that?

12:01.542 --> 12:04.641
'Cause I smoked you
on the track last week.

12:04.643 --> 12:08.111
For the sixth time.

12:08.113 --> 12:10.149
Hey, hey. That's enough.

12:10.152 --> 12:11.351
Who are you?

12:11.354 --> 12:13.539
- Police.
- Dressed like that?

12:13.542 --> 12:15.339
True.

12:15.342 --> 12:16.852
You're gonna argue with this badge?

12:16.855 --> 12:18.455
You saw what he did to my boy.

12:18.457 --> 12:19.823
I know what you did to his car.

12:19.825 --> 12:22.693
Call it an even trade.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.567
Y'all really cops?

12:30.569 --> 12:32.836
- Well, yeah, I'm a chief.
- Uh, the deputy...

12:32.838 --> 12:34.671
Yes, sir, Wyatt Logan.

12:34.673 --> 12:36.206
Big fan of yours.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.073
Makes you one lonely fella.

12:38.076 --> 12:40.010
We're actually looking for
a man named Ryan Millerson.

12:40.012 --> 12:41.578
Is this Old Rusty?

12:41.580 --> 12:43.914
Car that made the Fall Creek Run.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.349
How do you know about that?

12:45.351 --> 12:47.551
My dad's a driver. Not a racer.

12:47.553 --> 12:48.995
But he taught me some moves.

12:48.998 --> 12:50.721
So, Wendell, you could
really help us out if...

12:50.723 --> 12:52.189
Is it true you were running moonshine,

12:52.191 --> 12:53.890
and when you saw the police road blocks,

12:53.892 --> 12:55.592
you threw it into reverse,

12:55.594 --> 12:58.161
took a hairpin turn
backwards at 70 miles an hour?

12:58.163 --> 13:00.197
By the time the police got to my garage,

13:00.199 --> 13:03.066
I had my engine out the
car and on the chain,

13:03.068 --> 13:04.735
no charges filed.

13:04.737 --> 13:09.573
You, uh... It's fine.

13:14.847 --> 13:16.546
Is that moonshine?

13:16.548 --> 13:18.949
Just to show appreciation
for what you did for me?

13:18.951 --> 13:21.518
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'll take that.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.054
We actually, um, don't
want any moonshine,

13:24.056 --> 13:25.656
we just wanna know if you know

13:25.658 --> 13:26.957
who Ryan Millerson is.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.392
Everybody knows Ryan Millerson.

13:28.394 --> 13:29.926
- Oh.
- Can you introduce us?

13:29.928 --> 13:32.329
Sure. I already know you're Wyatt.

13:32.331 --> 13:34.431
I'm sorry, Lucy. Hello.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.933
Rufus.

13:36.935 --> 13:39.302
- What was that?
- What was what?

13:39.304 --> 13:41.138
You shook your head at me.

13:41.140 --> 13:44.541
I was... I was... I
was... I was... Never mind.

13:44.543 --> 13:46.643
Let me find someone to watch Old Rusty,

13:46.645 --> 13:48.628
then I'll take you to Ryan.

13:48.631 --> 13:50.998
Okay, thank you.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.449
- What was that?
- What're you doing?

13:52.451 --> 13:53.956
It's the nod.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.452
You know, when black
people see each other.

13:55.454 --> 13:56.486
The nod.

13:56.488 --> 13:57.988
Guess it's not a thing yet.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.589
So what's the deal with
this Wendell Scott dude?

13:59.591 --> 14:01.291
He runs moonshine and he's a racer?

14:01.293 --> 14:03.026
Well, that's how stock
car racing started.

14:03.028 --> 14:04.795
They were driving fast
to get away from the cops,

14:04.797 --> 14:07.297
and it turned into driving
fast on the dirt tracks.

14:07.299 --> 14:08.671
I know sports history too.

14:08.674 --> 14:10.133
Did he ever actually win?

14:10.135 --> 14:13.303
He only won a Grand
National in 1963, but...

14:13.305 --> 14:15.772
- But?
- He won by two laps, but

14:15.774 --> 14:17.607
they marked him third.

14:17.609 --> 14:20.911
Wendell argued, eventually
they gave him the prize money,

14:20.913 --> 14:22.846
- after all the fans had left.
- Jesus.

14:22.848 --> 14:25.148
So he never got the glory or the trophy.

14:25.150 --> 14:29.386
Huh, hunk of junk, fast
ride, smuggler, rebel, racer,

14:29.388 --> 14:33.190
and made the Fall Creek Run
in less than twelve parsecs?

14:33.192 --> 14:36.059
This Wendell Scott dude's
like a real-life Han Solo.

14:36.061 --> 14:39.863
- Yeah.
- Come on.

14:43.535 --> 14:46.036
How'd you know about Fall Creek Run?

14:46.038 --> 14:48.405
You a bootlegger
before you became a cop?

14:48.407 --> 14:49.840
I was.

14:49.842 --> 14:51.308
Misspent youth.

14:51.310 --> 14:52.976
Not a bad way to make ends meet, is it?

14:52.978 --> 14:55.120
Until I start winning

14:55.123 --> 14:56.513
the big races, anyway.

14:56.515 --> 14:58.190
Well, I'm sure you're gone.

14:58.193 --> 15:00.083
Let me see if I can get
y'all an introduction.

15:00.085 --> 15:02.385
All right.

15:02.387 --> 15:04.421
Yep, that's him.

15:04.423 --> 15:06.523
Wyatt Logan, notorious bootlegger.

15:06.526 --> 15:08.625
I was.

15:08.627 --> 15:10.292
No, seriously.

15:10.295 --> 15:12.028
I used to run stuff
across the Texas border.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.397
Oh, what, like you ran moonshine?

15:14.399 --> 15:17.300
Let's just say it was a
little stronger than that.

15:17.302 --> 15:18.769
A little more illegal.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.872
- How old were you?
- About 15.

15:24.042 --> 15:26.109
- You guys never asked.
- Y'all good?

15:26.111 --> 15:27.911
He'll see you after
the reporters clear out.

15:27.913 --> 15:30.714
Great, thank you so much.
It was great meeting you.

15:30.716 --> 15:32.983
- See you around.
- All right.

15:32.985 --> 15:35.118
- 'Ey, Bobby.
- See you later.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.387
Come on, fan boy.

15:37.389 --> 15:39.054
You think somebody's looking to hurt me?

15:39.057 --> 15:41.458
- Well, we're not sure.
- Doesn't make sense.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.560
I got lots of rivals, but no enemies.

15:43.562 --> 15:45.562
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

15:45.564 --> 15:47.531
- Anyone following you or...
- Maybe a...

15:47.533 --> 15:51.046
A woman with red hair and
freckles and an evil stare?

15:51.049 --> 15:53.336
I'd think I'd remember
somebody like that.

15:53.338 --> 15:54.771
Hey, Ryan.

15:54.773 --> 15:56.807
Has anyone, uh, been in here recently?

15:56.809 --> 15:58.003
I don't think so.

15:58.006 --> 15:59.543
I've been outside talking to reporters

15:59.545 --> 16:00.823
for the past 30 minutes.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.412
Ryan, there's something in here,

16:02.414 --> 16:05.115
looks like a trigger install.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.253
Whoa. It's a bomb.

16:12.881 --> 16:15.867
Guys?

16:15.870 --> 16:18.161
He's the Rittenhouse sleeper agent?

16:18.163 --> 16:19.630
How's he the sleeper?

16:23.841 --> 16:26.508
Well, what do we have here?

16:26.510 --> 16:28.855
The prodigal princess and her boy toys.

16:28.858 --> 16:31.480
Hello, Emma.

16:31.482 --> 16:33.682
Hand over your weapon.

16:33.684 --> 16:35.751
What're they doing here?

16:35.753 --> 16:39.121
Dying.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.468
Except maybe you.

16:40.471 --> 16:42.574
Tell me where the "Lifeboat"
is, I'll let you live.

16:42.577 --> 16:43.892
I promise.

16:43.894 --> 16:45.193
Right now your promises mean

16:45.195 --> 16:47.763
a grand total of jack squat to me.

16:47.765 --> 16:49.831
Que será, será.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.166
Do it.

16:51.168 --> 16:52.701
You want me to kill Carol's daughter?

16:52.703 --> 16:55.537
I'm ordering you to. Do it.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.976
Go, go, go.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.316
Over here.

17:24.468 --> 17:28.499
All clear.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.840
What the hell was that
thing you threw back there?

17:30.843 --> 17:33.644
Fire extinguisher grenade, obviously.

17:33.647 --> 17:36.945
Obviously. Well, thanks.

17:36.947 --> 17:38.880
Quit nodding at me.

17:38.882 --> 17:40.855
- Sorry.
- Who the hell are those folks?

17:40.858 --> 17:42.150
Bad people.

17:42.152 --> 17:43.585
Why are they trying to hurt Ryan?

17:43.587 --> 17:45.554
Well, Ryan's one of them.

17:45.556 --> 17:47.389
I've known Ryan for six years.

17:47.391 --> 17:49.644
He's a good man, churchgoing.

17:49.647 --> 17:51.493
And a communist.

17:51.495 --> 17:53.762
Communist? In South Carolina?

17:53.764 --> 17:56.865
That's right, Ryan Millerson
is a known communist

17:56.867 --> 17:59.207
who has embedded himself in
American society for years.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.402
How do you know that?

18:00.404 --> 18:02.204
Because we work for the government,

18:02.206 --> 18:03.839
hunting down those guys.

18:03.841 --> 18:06.274
That's right. We're commie hunters.

18:07.644 --> 18:09.177
Damn.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.879
Them good ol' boys
down back on the track

18:10.881 --> 18:13.081
messed up my engine again.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.650
Good news is my garage
is just up the way.

18:28.213 --> 18:30.465
I don't understand, I thought
you said that Ryan Millerson

18:30.467 --> 18:32.434
was some golden boy
of NASCAR or something.

18:32.436 --> 18:33.969
Had his poster on my wall.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.804
- What do you know about him?
- Millerson?

18:35.806 --> 18:38.306
He wins the Daytona 500 in 59...

18:38.308 --> 18:40.442
Further back. Where did he come from?

18:40.444 --> 18:42.811
Sort of came out of nowhere, like, 46?

18:42.813 --> 18:44.446
Out of nowhere?

18:44.448 --> 18:47.202
What if Rittenhouse
dropped him here in 46?

18:47.205 --> 18:48.884
Are you saying that he's from 2018?

18:48.886 --> 18:50.252
Like the World War I captain?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.120
That's exactly what I'm saying.

18:52.122 --> 18:53.688
Uh, Rittenhouse dropped him off,

18:53.690 --> 18:55.991
he lived his life and then
he became a racing legend.

18:55.993 --> 18:57.792
Which means that Rittenhouse
already changed history.

18:57.794 --> 18:59.895
No, no, I've known about
Millerson since I was a kid.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.796
Because they planted him in the past.

19:01.798 --> 19:04.402
All the memories you
have of him are new.

19:04.405 --> 19:05.700
Okay, this is simultaneously

19:05.702 --> 19:07.335
giving me a headache and a panic attack.

19:07.337 --> 19:09.170
What else has changed
that we don't know about?

19:09.172 --> 19:11.940
Whatever he's gonna do has
something to do with that bomb.

19:15.979 --> 19:17.379
This is it.

19:17.381 --> 19:19.147
It's this race, the Darlington 500.

19:19.149 --> 19:20.761
Damn it. I should've thought about that.

19:20.764 --> 19:21.694
What is it?

19:21.697 --> 19:23.161
This is one of the
biggest races of the year.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.653
All the car companies' CEOs are here,

19:24.655 --> 19:26.721
the top engineers, it's
everybody who matters.

19:26.723 --> 19:29.157
So Rittenhouse is just
gonna kill a bunch of

19:29.159 --> 19:30.392
car company executives?

19:30.394 --> 19:31.870
Cars are the most valuable industry

19:31.873 --> 19:32.972
in the world right now.

19:32.975 --> 19:34.262
It could cripple the companies.

19:34.264 --> 19:36.364
Rittenhouse would take
control of all of them.

19:36.366 --> 19:38.266
I mean, they could
basically run Detroit,

19:38.268 --> 19:41.569
which, you know, in 55
was still a big deal.

19:41.572 --> 19:43.038
Hey, Wendell.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.739
What?

19:44.741 --> 19:47.676
We're gonna need you to
get us back into that track.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.681
You're supposed to keep a low profile.

19:52.683 --> 19:56.518
Speaking at a tech symposium
doesn't qualify, no.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.320
I have done everything
you've asked of me

19:58.322 --> 20:00.422
these past two months.

20:00.424 --> 20:03.191
I took the blame for the
explosion at my headquarters.

20:03.193 --> 20:05.827
So we could go underground
without anyone looking for us.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.095
I forfeited my fortune.

20:07.097 --> 20:08.630
You were being funded by Rittenhouse.

20:08.632 --> 20:10.065
Come on, Connor, give me a break.

20:10.067 --> 20:12.734
I allowed myself to
become a global joke,

20:12.736 --> 20:14.102
an embarrassment,

20:14.104 --> 20:15.704
all so that we could fight Rittenhouse.

20:15.706 --> 20:18.073
Now, at some point, these
missions will be over,

20:18.075 --> 20:19.507
and I'll need to move forward.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.175
I need to begin reclaiming my name,

20:22.178 --> 20:23.411
my reputation.

20:23.413 --> 20:25.680
I'm sorry, but you spent over 20 years

20:25.682 --> 20:27.231
with more fame and
fortune than most people

20:27.233 --> 20:28.507
could ever dream of.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.786
A few more months living like
everyone else won't kill you.

20:31.788 --> 20:35.056
So cancel your appearance.

20:41.798 --> 20:45.367
Yeah!

20:45.369 --> 20:47.235
Here's my question.

20:47.237 --> 20:48.870
Why would someone on a suicide mission

20:48.872 --> 20:51.339
decide to fall in love and have a baby?

20:51.341 --> 20:54.275
Almost makes one question
one's commitment to the cause.

20:54.277 --> 20:55.835
I don't care about her.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.379
She's just a way to have
fun while I wait here

20:57.381 --> 20:58.747
for you to come back.

20:58.749 --> 21:02.272
The kid was an accident.

21:02.275 --> 21:04.219
What about those three
that came in here?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.620
Thought they were out of the picture.

21:05.622 --> 21:07.230
Reports of their death were premature.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.356
We'll keep an eye out.

21:08.358 --> 21:10.025
Besides, we've got soldier boy's gun.

21:10.027 --> 21:11.159
You'll be fine.

21:11.161 --> 21:12.827
Maybe it'd be smarter to wait.

21:12.829 --> 21:14.896
- Find another race.
- That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.698
Maybe spend a little
more time with your wife,

21:16.700 --> 21:19.634
see your kid born.

21:19.636 --> 21:23.371
- You squared away?
- Yeah.

21:23.373 --> 21:26.508
And what about you?

21:26.510 --> 21:28.643
Are you squared away?

21:28.645 --> 21:31.646
Of course I am.

21:50.007 --> 21:51.806
I just snuck your butts out of there.

21:51.808 --> 21:53.552
Now you're asking me
to sneak you back in?

21:53.555 --> 21:54.586
No way.

21:54.589 --> 21:56.611
We didn't wanna have
to tell you this, but

21:56.613 --> 21:58.646
there's a bomb in Ryan Millerson's car.

21:58.648 --> 22:00.715
We think he's planning on
killing a lot of people today.

22:00.717 --> 22:02.751
I don't know what you
three are really up to,

22:02.753 --> 22:04.285
but this whole communism story

22:04.287 --> 22:05.754
sounds like a bunch of bull to me.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.656
You guys mess with Ryan Millerson,

22:08.658 --> 22:10.692
the most popular driver on this circuit,

22:10.694 --> 22:12.660
every official there is
gonna be looking for you.

22:12.662 --> 22:14.195
And seeing as how they're
looking for a reason

22:14.197 --> 22:15.773
to keep me out of races,

22:15.776 --> 22:17.899
I ain't giving them one by
getting mixed up in this.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.701
- Sorry.
- Look.

22:19.703 --> 22:24.739
- People are gonna die.
- Or you're completely nuts.

22:24.741 --> 22:26.508
Uh, what the hell are you doing?

22:26.510 --> 22:28.661
Uh, I'm an engineer, I
thought I'd help fix your car.

22:28.664 --> 22:30.345
You know, I help you, you help us.

22:30.347 --> 22:33.014
- Get your hands off my engine.
- No, I got it, I... ah!

22:33.016 --> 22:36.117
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, are you okay?

22:36.119 --> 22:39.687
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, some engineer.

22:39.689 --> 22:41.256
Take this for his arm,

22:41.258 --> 22:44.726
and get the hell out of my garage.

22:44.728 --> 22:48.463
- We are so screwed.
- Maybe not.

22:51.735 --> 22:53.898
Right this way, Mr. Mason.

22:56.673 --> 22:58.125
And you'll be seated right here.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.349
Well, that's perfect, thank you.

22:59.351 --> 23:00.909
Okay, you're welcome.

23:00.911 --> 23:02.410
Connor?

23:02.412 --> 23:04.079
Vincent.

23:04.081 --> 23:05.680
I'm shocked to see you here.

23:05.682 --> 23:07.749
What topic do you plan
on speaking on today?

23:07.751 --> 23:10.952
Best ways to file for bankruptcy?

23:10.954 --> 23:13.955
Bankruptcy? That's temporary, Vincent.

23:13.957 --> 23:17.559
Ingenuity, now that lasts forever.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.394
I'm one idea away.

23:19.396 --> 23:21.796
You know ideas have always
come more easily to me

23:21.798 --> 23:24.399
than to you, haven't they?

23:24.401 --> 23:27.168
You must excuse me, I really
have to look at this speech.

23:27.170 --> 23:31.039
I am first up, after all.

23:36.713 --> 23:38.513
Wanker.

23:41.718 --> 23:43.797
Damn it. It was right there.

23:46.490 --> 23:50.191
Clogged fuel filter?

23:50.193 --> 23:53.094
I fixed it.

23:53.096 --> 23:54.762
We really are telling the truth.

23:54.764 --> 23:56.397
I am a fan.

23:56.399 --> 23:59.067
I was a bootlegger.

23:59.069 --> 24:02.804
And people really are in danger.

24:02.806 --> 24:05.109
You gotta get us onto that track, man.

24:07.344 --> 24:09.211
Let's see how you did.

24:14.284 --> 24:16.476
These floats tend to get stuck.

24:19.456 --> 24:22.323
Dad taught you how to drive and wrench?

24:22.325 --> 24:23.458
Sounds like a good man.

24:23.460 --> 24:27.128
He didn't do it out of love.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.831
When I'd mouth off he'd hit me, and, uh,

24:29.833 --> 24:32.726
throw me in the back of
his precious old Chevy,

24:32.729 --> 24:35.003
rip around the backwoods at
night with the lights off,

24:35.005 --> 24:36.671
just to scare the crap out of me.

24:36.673 --> 24:38.867
He'd run the car till something broke.

24:38.870 --> 24:42.867
He'd tell me I wasn't allowed
to come home until I fixed it.

24:42.870 --> 24:45.113
He'd just sit there with
his beer and his cigarettes,

24:45.115 --> 24:46.848
laughing at me.

24:46.850 --> 24:50.585
And I thought my daddy
was a son of a bitch.

24:50.587 --> 24:52.125
Give me a hand with this.

24:54.925 --> 24:57.225
This don't work.

24:57.227 --> 24:59.394
Your daddy's beatings
won't hold a candle

24:59.396 --> 25:00.662
to what I'm gonna do to you.

25:05.268 --> 25:08.002
- What'd your dad do?
- He wasn't mean.

25:08.004 --> 25:10.672
He just liked to gamble too much.

25:10.674 --> 25:12.207
One day, Mom told him to choose

25:12.209 --> 25:14.209
between his family and his racketing.

25:14.211 --> 25:15.677
Never saw him again.

25:15.679 --> 25:18.279
Shoot, I'd use to pray
my dad would run off.

25:18.281 --> 25:21.382
When I turned 15 and
realized he wouldn't,

25:21.384 --> 25:23.151
I did.

25:23.153 --> 25:24.919
I took his car.

25:24.921 --> 25:26.721
- You stole his car?
- Yeah.

25:26.723 --> 25:28.256
Figured he owed me at least that much.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.926
Ran it till the pistons blew
and I drove the damn thing

25:31.928 --> 25:33.061
straight into a lake.

25:33.063 --> 25:36.297
Mm.

25:41.838 --> 25:45.840
- Give it a shot.
- Yeah.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.949
Well...

25:57.587 --> 26:01.055
All right, I'll sneak
y'all back into the track.

26:01.057 --> 26:03.191
Really?

26:03.193 --> 26:06.127
Thank you, so much, um...

26:06.129 --> 26:07.731
just one question.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.063
How are we gonna get back in?

26:09.065 --> 26:10.787
Because I think they're
gonna be looking for us.

26:10.789 --> 26:13.668
Yeah, Rufus will ride up front with me.

26:13.671 --> 26:16.601
And you two are getting in another way.

26:29.238 --> 26:32.439
You two a'ight back there?

26:32.442 --> 26:34.743
Yeah, we're fine.

26:34.746 --> 26:37.413
Right?

26:37.416 --> 26:39.883
So far so good.

26:39.886 --> 26:43.354
So, if you're an engineer,

26:43.357 --> 26:45.600
who can't fix an engine,

26:45.602 --> 26:47.302
what kind of engineer are you?

26:47.304 --> 26:49.704
I work with other types of machines.

26:49.706 --> 26:51.272
Time-related ones.

26:51.274 --> 26:52.976
Clocks?

26:52.979 --> 26:54.374
You need schooling for that?

26:54.377 --> 26:57.111
Never heard of MIT?

26:57.113 --> 26:58.946
I heard of it.

26:58.948 --> 27:01.249
One of the best.

27:01.251 --> 27:02.895
Can't be too many black folk there.

27:02.898 --> 27:05.019
Yeah, yeah, well, you know how it is.

27:05.021 --> 27:08.122
One foot in front of the
other, and never quit.

27:08.124 --> 27:09.991
Sure do.

27:09.993 --> 27:12.727
That's how I plan on attacking NASCAR.

27:12.729 --> 27:16.831
Start winning races.

27:16.833 --> 27:18.700
Got your work cut out for you.

27:18.702 --> 27:20.201
Hell.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.670
What's too tough for everyone else,

27:22.672 --> 27:25.673
that's just right enough for us.

27:37.687 --> 27:42.156
- I'm sorry, I'm so...
- Wildly claustrophobic.

27:42.158 --> 27:44.192
- Not helping.
- Sorry.

27:44.194 --> 27:46.227
Ooh.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.629
- Oh, God.
- Here.

27:48.631 --> 27:51.833
Why don't you just
hang... Hang on to me.

28:00.343 --> 28:04.345
Is all that stuff you
said about your dad true?

28:06.516 --> 28:08.649
Hmm.

28:08.651 --> 28:11.252
I don't know how you do that. Just...

28:11.254 --> 28:12.920
Call him a bastard one second,

28:12.922 --> 28:14.756
and the next be laughing about it.

28:14.758 --> 28:17.925
Maybe it's 'cause I
drove his car into a lake.

28:19.462 --> 28:21.996
I just sort of let it go after that.

28:21.998 --> 28:24.599
Hmm.

28:24.601 --> 28:28.202
You're lucky you never admired him.

28:28.204 --> 28:32.907
Of course I admired him, he was my dad.

28:32.909 --> 28:34.675
For years I thought
that every terrible thing

28:34.677 --> 28:38.546
he did was my fault.

28:38.548 --> 28:41.816
I revered my mother.

28:41.818 --> 28:45.887
I thought she was Superwoman.

28:49.426 --> 28:55.062
Come to find out that
she's just terrible.

28:55.064 --> 28:58.733
Maybe it's a good thing.

28:58.735 --> 28:59.967
What do you mean?

28:59.969 --> 29:02.904
Well, now you know.

29:02.906 --> 29:06.240
You know for sure you can move on.

29:06.242 --> 29:09.844
Nothing ahead but the open road.

29:27.831 --> 29:29.794
Paid the race fees this morning, Carl.

29:29.797 --> 29:31.781
Looking for some unfamiliars.

29:31.784 --> 29:33.267
White couple and a Negro.

29:33.269 --> 29:34.969
Took a run at Millerson.

29:37.774 --> 29:39.407
I know you?

29:39.409 --> 29:43.678
That's George, my cousin.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.814
On my pit crew, you've
seen him half a dozen times.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.683
How's it going, Carl?

29:48.685 --> 29:51.652
We don't all look alike, you know.

29:51.654 --> 29:55.623
Anyway, gotta search your trunk.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.559
Look, man, I'm in a rush, but, uh,

29:58.561 --> 30:01.229
give you ten bucks, you let us
skate on by and get to racing.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.968
Many thanks.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.971
Now open your trunk.

30:29.459 --> 30:32.460
- This really necessary...
- Now.

30:44.121 --> 30:45.648
All good?

30:59.589 --> 31:01.822
Told you I had it.

31:07.363 --> 31:10.197
You all right?

31:10.199 --> 31:14.201
Wasn't expecting that.

31:32.322 --> 31:34.203
Didn't mean to interrupt.

31:46.690 --> 31:48.957
Ryan.

31:48.959 --> 31:51.727
Hey, baby.

31:51.729 --> 31:53.996
You can't be here in your condition.

31:53.998 --> 31:55.419
Go home and rest, huh?

31:55.422 --> 31:57.292
Well, might've, but that
reporter that stopped by

31:57.294 --> 32:02.004
earlier came and got me,
and said you wanted me here.

32:02.006 --> 32:06.375
Hey, my eyes on you
won't make you nervous.

32:06.377 --> 32:09.211
Make you calm, right?

32:09.213 --> 32:12.880
Right.

32:12.883 --> 32:14.282
I love you.

32:14.284 --> 32:17.185
I love you back.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.402
Take her away from here.

32:33.404 --> 32:35.637
I'm begging you, please.

32:35.639 --> 32:38.974
Well, what does it matter if
she's just part of your cover?

32:38.976 --> 32:42.778
I'll be sitting right
next to her in the stands.

32:42.780 --> 32:46.782
Carry out your mission, or she dies.

32:46.784 --> 32:50.118
It's that simple, you understand?

32:50.120 --> 32:52.087
Yes.

32:52.089 --> 32:53.588
Ryan.

32:53.590 --> 32:55.924
Press wants a few last
photos and interviews

32:55.926 --> 32:57.926
before the big race.

32:57.928 --> 32:59.394
- 'Course.
- Come on in, fellas.

32:59.396 --> 33:02.130
Gather around.

33:05.703 --> 33:08.236
- Look over there.
- Who's that?

33:08.238 --> 33:10.472
Those are the guys from
Ford, GM and Chrysler.

33:10.474 --> 33:12.441
Ryan's gonna ram into
them with that bomb.

33:12.443 --> 33:13.608
Kill 'em all.

33:13.610 --> 33:15.043
Good Lord.

33:15.045 --> 33:16.478
We gotta get in Millerson's garage.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.113
We're just gonna go
in there without a gun?

33:18.115 --> 33:20.615
Well, we don't really
have any other choice.

33:20.617 --> 33:22.818
Getting in isn't the problem.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.553
Getting out is.

33:24.555 --> 33:25.887
I got it.

33:25.889 --> 33:28.056
It's cold, so I'll Casper.

33:28.058 --> 33:29.691
You head in and rip a cherry,

33:29.693 --> 33:31.487
then make a snow angel and go to church.

33:31.490 --> 33:33.061
Rip it? In front of everyone?

33:33.063 --> 33:34.722
Do you have any idea what
they're talking about?

33:34.724 --> 33:35.964
I think it's smuggle talk.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.365
That or they're both having a stroke.

33:37.367 --> 33:40.168
- Come on, man.
- All right, yeah.

33:40.170 --> 33:42.904
Wait, wait. You're just gonna leave?

33:42.906 --> 33:45.240
It's all good. Come on.

33:47.077 --> 33:50.746
So why'd you decide to go
with Chevrolet as a sponsor?

33:50.748 --> 33:52.814
Here's my answer.

33:52.816 --> 33:54.416
So you're predicting first?

33:54.418 --> 33:56.318
By three laps.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.720
I like being the
opposite of an underdog.

33:58.722 --> 34:02.424
Makes me remember that I was once a...

34:02.426 --> 34:04.092
You were once what?

34:04.094 --> 34:05.861
Uh...

34:05.863 --> 34:07.496
M... Mr. Millerson?

34:09.666 --> 34:11.666
Hey, somebody break it off.

34:11.668 --> 34:14.268
Hey, stop it!

34:14.271 --> 34:16.772
You two, stop it now.

34:16.774 --> 34:18.306
Somebody get the cops.

34:30.087 --> 34:31.341
Ryan!

34:31.344 --> 34:33.288
Ryan, stop.

34:33.290 --> 34:35.474
Stop!

34:46.203 --> 34:48.303
Wyatt.

34:48.304 --> 34:51.672
Go, come on.

34:54.143 --> 34:55.510
He armed the bomb.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.646
What? Then disarm it!

34:57.648 --> 34:58.814
I gotta get to the engine.

34:58.816 --> 35:00.916
No!

35:05.724 --> 35:06.927
Rufus!

35:17.801 --> 35:19.501
Wyatt, I don't know if you know this,

35:19.503 --> 35:21.403
but the bomb in this
car is pressure-sensitive

35:21.405 --> 35:24.406
and we are going really fast.

35:31.582 --> 35:33.381
Guys!

35:33.383 --> 35:35.958
We've got company.

35:37.754 --> 35:40.355
- Wyatt, it's still armed.
- Okay, I get it, Rufus.

35:40.357 --> 35:43.058
Good, because if you so much
as hit a bug, we're done.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.826
Well, in order to get
away from them, Rufus,

35:44.828 --> 35:46.529
I might need to hit a couple of bugs.

35:48.866 --> 35:50.765
Guys, they're gonna hit us.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.786
Hang on.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.690
- You lost one!
- Hang on.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.605
If you wanna slow down, feel free.

36:54.831 --> 36:57.766
Too fast, you're gonna hit the car.

37:16.453 --> 37:19.321
Phew!

37:19.323 --> 37:21.456
How we doing?

37:29.399 --> 37:31.008
Uh, you sure that won't go off?

37:31.010 --> 37:33.277
Yeah, pretty sure. I think so.

37:33.279 --> 37:35.445
Just kidding.

37:35.447 --> 37:37.614
Well, thank you

37:37.616 --> 37:39.349
for everything.

37:39.351 --> 37:41.021
Wasn't nothing, ma'am.

37:41.024 --> 37:42.751
That was some driving out there.

37:42.754 --> 37:44.887
We should hit the track some time.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.790
You have no idea how amazing it is

37:46.793 --> 37:48.724
you're asking me to do that.

37:48.727 --> 37:52.029
I'll be here.

37:52.031 --> 37:53.497
Like that?

37:53.499 --> 37:54.998
That's pretty good.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.067
It's gonna catch on at
some point, so, you know,

37:57.069 --> 37:59.369
- you'll be a trendsetter.
- Maybe.

37:59.371 --> 38:03.482
I'll have won my first
race for sure by then.

38:03.485 --> 38:04.984
What?

38:04.987 --> 38:06.410
Y'all don't think I can do it?

38:06.412 --> 38:07.878
We...

38:07.880 --> 38:12.282
It's not that, I'm sure
you will, it's just...

38:12.284 --> 38:14.718
you really think they'll
give a black man the prize?

38:14.720 --> 38:16.620
Of course not.

38:16.622 --> 38:19.189
What, y'all think I'm thick?

38:19.191 --> 38:21.425
They ain't gonna call
no race for a black man.

38:21.427 --> 38:23.160
Sure as hell won't give me no trophy.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.861
Why do it?

38:24.863 --> 38:27.230
I wanna race and be the best.

38:27.232 --> 38:29.499
No more wisdom behind it than that.

38:29.501 --> 38:32.502
And if they don't like it, screw 'em.

38:35.374 --> 38:37.774
Give 'em hell, Wendell.

38:54.259 --> 38:56.326
You burned it.

38:56.328 --> 38:59.997
Yeah, it's nothing.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.366
Hey, it's fine.

39:02.368 --> 39:04.067
You know what I was thinking?

39:04.069 --> 39:06.803
Maybe we could make breakfast
for everyone in the morning?

39:06.805 --> 39:08.490
You in?

39:08.493 --> 39:10.857
Sure.

39:10.860 --> 39:12.743
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

39:12.745 --> 39:15.746
Good night.

39:17.783 --> 39:20.497
And it is with this vision and...

39:20.500 --> 39:22.819
Mr. Mason, quite a crowd out there.

39:22.821 --> 39:25.122
- We're about to open the doors.
- Great, thank you.

39:25.124 --> 39:26.124
You're welcome.

39:32.131 --> 39:33.497
Sir.

39:33.499 --> 39:36.366
You need to come with us. Now.

39:36.368 --> 39:37.968
Get your hands off
me. You know who I am.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.770
You're Connor Mason
and you're under arrest

39:39.772 --> 39:42.139
for conspiracy to commit
fraud and aiding and abetting

39:42.141 --> 39:45.142
an enemy of the state.

39:47.746 --> 39:49.379
You can't do this to me here.

39:49.381 --> 39:50.914
You can walk out or be carried.

39:50.916 --> 39:54.918
Pick one.

40:01.060 --> 40:04.594
Thought you were first up.

40:06.198 --> 40:08.465
You did it to yourself. I warned you.

40:08.467 --> 40:09.789
That was unforgivable.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.482
Unforgivable is putting
the team in danger

40:11.485 --> 40:13.003
just to feed your own ego.

40:13.005 --> 40:15.739
If you ever try to pull
anything like this ever again,

40:15.741 --> 40:18.875
you will walk into a prison
and you will never walk out.

40:18.877 --> 40:21.278
Do you understand me?

40:21.280 --> 40:25.682
Connor.

40:25.684 --> 40:30.320
- Yes.
- Good.

40:30.322 --> 40:32.456
You failed. That's the short of it.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.477
Yep, we failed 'cause your daughter,

40:34.480 --> 40:36.860
who you should've let me kill
in 1918, is still out there.

40:36.862 --> 40:38.361
So this is my fault.

40:38.363 --> 40:40.530
I'm saying you share
some responsibility, yes.

40:40.532 --> 40:41.781
For everything.

40:41.784 --> 40:43.998
Two more of our soldiers are
dead after listening to you.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.302
Our course will soon be set.

40:45.304 --> 40:46.870
Why, because of dear leader Nicholas?

40:46.872 --> 40:48.371
Watch your mouth.

40:48.373 --> 40:50.507
Without his writings
we wouldn't be here.

40:50.509 --> 40:52.142
Where is here exactly?

40:52.144 --> 40:54.878
Is your aloof, younger
grandfather ready to lead

40:54.880 --> 40:57.380
or is he still asking for pickled eggs?

40:57.382 --> 41:00.383
Ma'am, you have to take a look at this.

41:08.494 --> 41:11.728
What the hell is this?

41:16.335 --> 41:18.135
It's a map.

41:18.137 --> 41:20.370
Don't call it that.

41:20.372 --> 41:23.607
A map is for explorers.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.208
That isn't who we are.

41:25.210 --> 41:27.611
It doesn't do us justice.

41:27.613 --> 41:31.481
What we are are artists.

41:31.483 --> 41:34.484
Time is our canvass, and this

41:34.486 --> 41:35.752
is our brush.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.554
When did you do all this?

41:37.556 --> 41:40.857
While the rest of you were
rolling your eyes at me,

41:40.859 --> 41:44.561
contemplating whether or
not I was a competent leader.

41:44.563 --> 41:47.831
Now it's time to begin
preserving human culture.

41:47.833 --> 41:50.834
Taking what's best of us,

41:50.836 --> 41:54.571
and subtracting and
sloughing away the worst.

41:54.573 --> 41:58.542
Shaping, cutting away at the rock

41:58.544 --> 42:01.411
that is the human race, until
it resembles something like

42:01.413 --> 42:04.714
Michelangelo's "David."

42:04.716 --> 42:06.950
Until it reaches...

42:08.987 --> 42:11.988
perfection everlasting.

42:15.230 --> 42:19.332
We few will save the world.

42:19.335 --> 42:20.891
Wow.
