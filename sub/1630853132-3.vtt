<i>"The Girl from Plainville"...</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:10.677
- You have to say the first
thing that pops into your head.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.970
It's a word game.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.057
- Disney.
- Princess.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.142
- Pretty.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.020
At 6:25 p. m.,
<i>he tells her, "Almost there."</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.314
<i>She says, "Okay,"</i>
<i>then three hours later,</i>

00:22.314 --> 00:25.692
<i>"Please answer me.</i>
<i>I'm scared.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:27.319
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you actually did it."</i>

00:27.319 --> 00:28.779
So what do you want?

00:28.779 --> 00:31.198
- A warrant for her phone.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.659
Bring me something
<i>that can prove intent,</i>

00:33.659 --> 00:35.035
<i>contradiction,</i>
<i>even a cover-up.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.453
<i>Then we'll talk.</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:38.580
- When he went missing,
she was, like, freaking out.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.416
- Missing?

00:41.416 --> 00:43.502
- Yeah, he was missing
for, like, three days.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.587
- She was texting us
the whole time.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.815
- That's cold.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.025
- Not anymore.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.405
- Huh.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.949
- Rayburn, Sutter wants you.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.085
Morning, sir.
Gordon.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.588
- Katie,
what's your thoughts on this?

02:09.588 --> 02:11.798
Gordon, fill her in.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.093
Okay, Michelle Carter,
17-year-old girl,

02:15.093 --> 02:17.387
texts her friends
for three days telling them

02:17.387 --> 02:19.514
her boyfriend's missing,
maybe dead.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.642
Nobody can find him.
She's panicked.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.853
Only thing is, he's not.
- Not what?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.438
- Not missing.
- Well, where is he?

02:26.438 --> 02:28.273
- At home for three more days.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.983
- What happens
after three days?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.318
- He killed himself.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.030
But this girl knew
he wasn't missing or dead.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.116
She was in contact with him
the whole time.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.619
- You think she knew
he was gonna kill himself?

02:40.619 --> 02:44.623
- They were texting about it
for months, weeks, days, hours,

02:44.623 --> 02:46.416
right up until the point
that he actually did it.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.294
She was telling him to do it.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.298
Encouraging him.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.549
- You talk to her?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.426
Talked to her friends.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.012
Look, her story seems
inconsistent.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.058
I think we've got
a manslaughter charge here.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.561
This kid has
a history of depression.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.856
Years on SSRIs, hospital stays,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.234
swallowed a bottle of Tylenol
two years ago.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.111
Seriously, Gordon--
- Once you read the texts

03:14.111 --> 03:15.487
between these two,
you're gonna get it.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.614
Also, I got his phone records

03:17.614 --> 03:19.908
from the boy's mom,
and there are two phone calls

03:19.908 --> 03:22.285
between the two of them
from that night.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.287
- Yeah, well,
even if I get you a warrant,

03:24.287 --> 03:25.455
they're not gonna give you

03:25.455 --> 03:26.748
a transcript
of their phone call.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.041
- Yes, but there's gotta be

03:28.041 --> 03:29.042
more communication
between them,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.460
and the only way I can get it

03:30.460 --> 03:32.712
is by getting my hands
on her phone.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.381
- What motive
could she possibly have

03:34.381 --> 03:35.757
for wanting him
to kill himself?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.467
- That's what I want
to find out.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.846
- Mm...

03:40.846 --> 03:42.347
okay, I'll get you a warrant,

03:42.347 --> 03:43.932
but do not push me

03:43.932 --> 03:45.934
if you find out
there's no there-there.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.687
You're welcome.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.896
- Thank you.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.164
- Hi.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.958
- Hi.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.128
Oh, I'm meeting a friend.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.299
Uh, Nat, I'll text you later.
- Okay, bye.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.510
- Bye, Cassie.
- Bye.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.604
- So are you--
- So how have you--

04:30.604 --> 04:32.272
- Oh, sorry, sorry. You go.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.150
- Yeah, no, I was just
gonna, um,

04:35.150 --> 04:36.985
ask how you're doing.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.742
- You know, I'm...I'm okay.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.496
It's hard to sleep.

04:47.496 --> 04:51.958
Nighttime was kind of our time,
me and Conrad.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.587
It's really sweet of you
to ask.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.758
Now that the fundraiser's over,
you know,

04:59.758 --> 05:03.470
I'm just trying to figure out
what to do next, you know,

05:03.470 --> 05:05.138
for Conrad.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.973
Like, I'm trying
to be there for his family,

05:06.973 --> 05:11.186
you know, for his mom.

05:11.186 --> 05:15.482
- Um...so you know
that text you sent me?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.696
- Which text?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.490
- About that night?

05:23.490 --> 05:26.201
- Oh, yeah.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.870
I don't know why I said that.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.542
Um...

05:33.542 --> 05:36.753
everything with Conrad
was really complicated,

05:36.753 --> 05:38.922
you know, obviously.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.925
Um, he was just so sad,

05:41.925 --> 05:43.969
and he didn't really feel like
he could talk to anyone,

05:43.969 --> 05:46.221
except me, of course.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.806
- Yeah, I mean, it was a lot
for you--

05:47.806 --> 05:49.558
- Which was okay, you know?

05:49.558 --> 05:52.477
Obviously, 'cause I loved him,
and...

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
but I just wish
that his family knew

05:54.479 --> 05:56.648
that I was there for them too,

05:56.648 --> 05:58.233
that they can open up to me.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.610
But also wish
that somebody would

06:00.610 --> 06:01.987
care about how I'm feeling.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.655
You know, if anyone...
- Well, I care--

06:03.655 --> 06:04.781
- Wants to ask how I'm doing...

06:04.781 --> 06:05.824
- Michelle.
- Or how I'm feeling.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.159
- Michelle, stop.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.537
I'm asking if you're okay.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.664
- Right.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.792
Of course. I know. I'm--

06:15.792 --> 06:17.502
I'm sorry. So sorry.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.795
- No,
you don't have to be sorry.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.298
I just--
- Yeah.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.216
I know.
- Okay.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.968
- You're right. I'm sorry.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.303
- No.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.602
- You're such a good friend,
Natalie.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.145
Thank you
for being here for me.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.117
What?
I haven't.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.910
- You did!
Oh, my God, come on, Nat.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.162
That is not true.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.080
- The night
at Danny's graduation party?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.957
Okay, yes. Okay.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.250
- Yeah!
- Okay, okay, I forgot.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.085
Okay, okay, me next.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.380
Um, never have I ever...

07:04.591 --> 07:06.217
Had sex on the beach.

07:10.639 --> 07:14.976
- Um, excuse me, what?
- What?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.312
- Well, it wasn't sex,
so actually, never mind.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.397
- No, no, no, no, no.
You put a finger down.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.400
You have to tell the story.
Come on.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.194
We're waiting.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.988
It was just this guy
I met in Florida

07:26.988 --> 07:28.323
a few months ago.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.659
We, you know, fooled around.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.203
Details, bitch.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.248
Did you just, like, make out,
or did you go down on him?

07:37.248 --> 07:39.793
Did he go down on you?
Cassie.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.961
- Yeah, he did that.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.880
- Oh, my God.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.965
How come you never told?
Michelle.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.885
- Maybe 'cause she knew you'd
start third-degreeing her.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.474
- Oh, it's officially
getting hot in here.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.144
Natalia, shall we take a loop?
Sure.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.606
You coming?

08:01.606 --> 08:04.234
- I'm good.
I'll let the boys come to me.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.447
- Never have I ever wanted
to be part of that clique.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.159
- You know, they're just...

08:13.159 --> 08:16.996
- Oh, trust me, I know.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.457
I have friends like that
back at my school.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.962
Everyone's always so worried

08:23.962 --> 08:26.756
about the dudes
being mean to us.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.634
Meanwhile, we're over here
tearing each other's hair out.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.012
Girls are the worst.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.806
- Some girls are.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.270
I almost didn't come
on this trip.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.479
- And miss the Canada Cup

08:41.479 --> 08:43.815
International
Softball Championship?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.821
You're glad you came
now, though, right?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.867
- Yeah.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.118
Yeah, I am.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.204
- Me too.

09:01.958 --> 09:06.129
So tell me more about
this scandalous beach affair.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.048
- Oh, my God, it wasn't.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.424
- Sure, sure.

09:11.009 --> 09:15.722
- We texted a few times,
but he kind of disappeared.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.225
- Never have I ever taken you
for a one-night stand girl.

09:20.310 --> 09:24.105
- Babe, I'm full of surprises.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.387
You done?

09:56.387 --> 09:57.597
- No, sir.

10:04.395 --> 10:09.317
The last run for you,
for a while, anyway, yeah?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.611
You feel good?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.030
Being out here this year?
Did you have a good time?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.160
- Yeah.
- Good.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.580
You know, going back to school,

10:22.580 --> 10:25.625
back to your mom's

10:25.625 --> 10:29.254
after the long runs, it--

10:29.254 --> 10:34.008
it might be--might be tricky
for a little bit.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.594
But you'll get used to it.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.971
Yeah?

10:41.724 --> 10:44.644
All right, back at it.
- Yes, sir.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.799
There he is!

11:17.427 --> 11:19.721
There's the son
of Mattapoisett.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.140
Did you enjoy your last run?
- Eh.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.934
- All right, you guys, come on.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.853
Party's over.
You're still on the clock.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.230
I don't want
to have to call your wives

11:29.230 --> 11:31.107
and explain why you're
fucking passed out on my dock.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.234
You, put down the beer.
Come on.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.569
Look at the slack here.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.446
Coil it up, now.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.325
All right, back at it, boys.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.997
- Oh, Christ.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.458
Holly.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.880
God damn it, drop it!

12:35.880 --> 12:37.215
Drop it!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.052
Inside.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.450

<i>But David did not wallow</i>

13:04.450 --> 13:07.954
and fast and weep.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.665
He stood, washed,

13:10.665 --> 13:13.918
and fed
because he trusted the Lord.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.546
And David says...

13:18.047 --> 13:20.466
"I shall go to him,

13:20.466 --> 13:23.052
but he will not return to me."

13:23.052 --> 13:25.221
Because he knew they would
one day meet again...

13:25.221 --> 13:27.432
In heaven.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.937
- Put away the goddamn phones.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.154
We announce our faith
as we say, "I believe..."

13:42.030 --> 13:44.323
<i>- What are you thinking?</i>
- Huh?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.075
Usual?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.493
- Uh, yes.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.040
Here you go.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.291
You guys want
a couple of rolls?

13:53.291 --> 13:54.959
- Don't know why I even look.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.629
Thanks.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.256
- Thanks.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.592
- You guys speak
in full sentences on that boat?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.510
- Not if we don't have to.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.970
- Oh, cut it out.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.263
Whoo!

14:08.723 --> 14:10.558
- I'm glad you're back.
I missed you.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.603
- It was just a three-week run.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.147
- Yeah, well, three weeks can
feel like forever sometimes.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.818
Now you're back-back
and you're home, for good.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.571
- For now, I guess.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.700
- How was it?
Was it fun?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.911
- It's not really fun.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.706
It was--you know, it was work.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.543
- And how was it with your dad?
Everything okay?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.128
- Yeah.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.967
Here we go.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.553
Here we go.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.554
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.223
All right, enjoy.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.475
Listen, I'm not mad
or anything,

14:52.475 --> 14:54.102
but we need to talk
about something.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.395
- Okay.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.523
- I found some dope
in your room.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.112
We talked about this.
I don't want it in the house.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.698
Especially around your sisters.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.829
If I find it again,
we're gonna have a problem.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.207
You're their big brother.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.501
It's your responsibility
to set a good example.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.799
What?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.801
- Nothing.
You're right. I get it.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.846
No more dope.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.848
- Pinkie swear?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.982
What?

15:40.982 --> 15:42.191
Not even a grunt this time?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.375
Michelle.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.585
I'm Detective Gordon.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.504
Uh, just need to ask you
a couple of questions.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.632
You're, uh--you're 18, correct?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.092
- Yeah.
- Right.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.845
So, uh, you can talk to me
on your own.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.680
Come on.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.358
So the reason why
I came out here is because

16:24.358 --> 16:27.278
I'm looking into Conrad Roy's
unfortunate passing.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.574
That, um--that fundraiser
you threw for him,

16:31.574 --> 16:34.076
that was--that was nice.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.621
We learned you did
a lot of nice things

16:36.621 --> 16:40.333
to help Conrad
and to help his family.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.919
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.462
We determined
that you probably had

16:44.462 --> 16:46.631
a lot of contact with him.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.049
- Yeah.

16:48.049 --> 16:52.220
- Maybe even right up until
pretty close to the time

16:52.220 --> 16:55.348
in which maybe he stopped
having contact with anybody?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.476
- Um...

16:58.476 --> 17:00.061
yeah.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.355
- Did you have contact
with him that day,

17:02.355 --> 17:03.898
right up until he passed?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.692
- I don't think so.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.862
- Did he tell you
he was gonna do that

17:09.862 --> 17:11.072
or anything like that?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.204
- He'd been talking about it
for a while.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.875
He told me that nobody would
be able to help him, and...

17:22.875 --> 17:24.835
we were talking that night,

17:24.835 --> 17:26.587
and, like, the phone cut off,

17:26.587 --> 17:28.714
but I didn't think
anything of it.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.386
- Okay.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.972
Is--is that your phone?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.485
All right, so, um,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.404
I've got a warrant
for this phone.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.616
- Wait, you're taking my phone?

17:55.616 --> 17:56.826
- Yeah.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.995
I'm gonna accompany you
to your home,

17:58.995 --> 18:00.705
and I'm gonna collect
your computer

18:00.705 --> 18:02.373
and any other device

18:02.373 --> 18:04.000
that might connect
to the internet.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.044
- Mm.
- Do you understand?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.631
Mm.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.884
- Okay.
You're gonna come with me.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.923
I think I have the right
to know why our daughter

18:52.923 --> 18:55.384
just got escorted home
in a police cruiser!

18:55.384 --> 18:57.595
- Lower your voice.
- Dad, please.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.764
I'm Conrad's girlfriend.

18:59.764 --> 19:00.890
Of course
they're reaching out to me.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.391
They're looking for answers.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.685
- What answers could you
possibly give the police?

19:04.685 --> 19:06.687
They had a warrant, Michelle.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.898
- He didn't talk
to anybody else.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.108
I'm the only one who knows
why he really did it.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.235
- Well, why did he do it?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.363
- He was too bright
for this world.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.074
He was my star,
and he left too soon.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.451
- Is that from <i>Glee?</i>

19:20.451 --> 19:22.119
- Mind your own
fucking business, Hayden.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.871
- Hey,
watch your language!
- Michelle.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.207
- I can't believe you guys
are attacking me like this,

19:26.207 --> 19:27.958
after everything
I've been through.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.418
Leave me alone!

19:30.836 --> 19:32.880
Michelle!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.295
You are such a dork.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.589
- I is what I is.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.925
I can't believe
you've never seen this.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.803
- Ah, just never got into it.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.096
So that's the main couple.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.724
- Rachel and Finn.
- Mm.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.017
- They just put off
their engagement in real life.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.395
- Mm, the will they,
won't they?

20:29.395 --> 20:32.064
Television necessity.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.357
Are those two together?

20:33.357 --> 20:36.360
- Yeah--or not yet.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.448
They start off as friends,
best friends,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.450
and then
they eventually get together.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.745
- That's rad.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.997
I'm surprised
the show goes there.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.749
- They're an amazing couple.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.042
So in love.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.420
They have their moments, but...

20:54.420 --> 20:57.506
they always end up
back together.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.133
Completely loyal.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.640
Your friends are dicks.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.225
They don't deserve you.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.730
- Yeah, I know. Just...

21:14.190 --> 21:17.568
I'd just like one day

21:17.568 --> 21:20.404
of not worrying
about who's fighting,

21:20.404 --> 21:23.616
who's not talking,
all that shit.

21:25.826 --> 21:30.581
I can't ever just...be
with them.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.749
You know?

21:33.751 --> 21:36.212
- You can just be with me.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.089
You know that, right?

21:40.382 --> 21:41.967
- Obviously.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.557
- I'm done.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.934
You like?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.269
Love.
Can you put it on me?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.862
- How's that?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.197
Too tight?

22:03.197 --> 22:04.281
- No.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.288
- Susie, it's dinnertime.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.915
Is Michelle's mom almost here?

22:12.915 --> 22:15.543
- Mm, yeah,
she's coming, right?

22:15.543 --> 22:16.710
- I'll check.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.216
<i>[Keenan the First,</i>
<i>Aleks James,</i>

22:22.216 --> 22:25.219
<i>and Marsel-IS' "Mooda Chainz"</i>
<i>playing over speakers]</i>

23:06.051 --> 23:09.346
- Yo, what's up, son?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.265
Come--

23:15.895 --> 23:17.438
- Fucking fuck.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.773
Yo, you hear
about that Kimye shit?

23:19.773 --> 23:21.984
Yo, what's up, son?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.528
Pop culture. Pop culture.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.322
Current events.

23:26.322 --> 23:30.534
Knowledge. Knowledge.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.257


23:51.180 --> 23:53.015


24:04.443 --> 24:06.070
- Robby boy!

24:06.070 --> 24:08.614
- Yo, yo, Coco in the house.
Welcome back, man.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.949
- What's up, son?

24:11.575 --> 24:13.494
Hey, did you hear about Kimye?

24:13.494 --> 24:16.705
- Hey, Mahoney.
- What's up?

24:16.705 --> 24:18.540


24:18.540 --> 24:20.751
- Sorry, what?
- Kimye?

24:20.751 --> 24:23.045
- Hey, Robby.
- Hey, Carla.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.714
- Bye, Robby.
- Bye, Carla.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.302
Dude, that chick is crazy.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.428
- Oh, yeah?

24:31.428 --> 24:33.305
- Be afraid.
Be very, very afraid.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.016
- What's up, Mahoney?
- What's up, O'Connor?

24:36.016 --> 24:38.519
- Trucks later?
- Trucks. For sure. Trucks.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.396
Sorry, what?

24:40.396 --> 24:42.439
- No, it's cool.
- Robby.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.361
- I thought she was crazy.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.989
- Exactly.
See you later?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.660


25:09.425 --> 25:10.426
Claire finally quit.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.552
Oh, you scared her off.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.804
Well, it only took three years.

25:13.804 --> 25:17.391
- My boy's back.
- Oh, there's the one.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.102
- Look at how handsome he is.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.735
Mm, someone smells like booze.

25:27.735 --> 25:31.405
- I think that might be
the chardonnay talking.

25:31.405 --> 25:34.908
- Huh? Coming for me.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.910
- Can I tell him
the, um--

25:36.910 --> 25:38.996
all right.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.456
So I'm on my shift.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.665
ER rounds this week,

25:41.665 --> 25:43.667
so, you know,
it's a fucking nightmare.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.754
And this skinny,
nervous-looking guy comes in.

25:46.754 --> 25:49.757
Says he's got a stomachache
but doesn't want to say why,

25:49.757 --> 25:53.802
but I can tell he's--you know,
he's walking kind of funny.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.680
So we get him under the X-ray.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.557
The doc puts up the images,

25:58.557 --> 26:01.727
and...there it is.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.981
A toilet brush.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.232
- Where?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.484
His ass.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.699
- No way.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.286
- I just have
so many questions.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.996
Like a fucking chimney sweep.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.141
Stop it.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.983
There she is.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.906
- Hi, Conrad.

27:40.534 --> 27:43.954
- Finally, she speaks.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.665
- Me?
I've been right here.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.125
- What are you doing now?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.129
- Playing basketball.

27:52.129 --> 27:54.590
What are you doing?

27:54.590 --> 27:55.924
- What do you think?

27:59.011 --> 28:02.472
- How are you?
- Meh.

28:02.472 --> 28:05.017
Headed back to school.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.060
In a completely different
class now

28:07.060 --> 28:08.520
'cause of my year off.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.898
Back at my mom's.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.232
It's weird.
I don't know.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.403
Tell me.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.909
- It feels like my brain
works differently now.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.662
The boat is all guys
my dad's age,

28:25.662 --> 28:28.749
and I figured out
how to talk to them,

28:28.749 --> 28:33.420
but now I don't know
how to be a kid anymore.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.133
- That's because
you're an old soul, Conrad.

28:41.845 --> 28:45.223
- On the boat,
everything made sense.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.975
Every day,
I knew what I was doing.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.686
You never felt like...

28:51.396 --> 28:52.898
You didn't know
what was coming.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.483
- Like a checklist.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.779
- Exactly.
- That sounds amazing.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.072
I wish I had that

29:00.072 --> 29:01.990
but for, like, school
and friends and whatever.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.786
- Yes.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.330
- What if you had
a checklist for life?

29:08.330 --> 29:09.998
Like, you just did the thing,

29:09.998 --> 29:12.668
move on to the next thing,
everything easy.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.877
Check, check, check.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.587
- That's what I'm saying.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.215
On the water, there's order.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.883
Calm.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.259
'Cause you know what's coming,

29:21.259 --> 29:23.220
even if it's, like,
a storm or something.

29:24.930 --> 29:28.141
Boats are simple...

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
but complicated.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.979
They built them
with their hands,

29:31.979 --> 29:35.607
and we have to work them
with our hands.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.526
It's tactile.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.777
- Tactile?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.533
- Yeah, like, physical.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.746
- I get it.

29:49.746 --> 29:53.750
Like something to hold on to.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.086
Move your body.
Get out of your head.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.630
- Yeah, exactly.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.137
Hey, do you remember the pier?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.680
- Yeah.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.392
- Sand.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.852
- Hand.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.020
- Band.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.483
- Why now?

30:20.402 --> 30:21.778
- Why...

30:24.740 --> 30:27.325
- You never came
to say goodbye that day.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.785
You just disappeared.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.748
- I know.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.709
I'm sorry.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.131
I fucked up.
It's my fault.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.758
It's always my fault.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.262
- So why now?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.807
- I miss talking to you
at 3:00 a. m.

30:53.477 --> 30:54.978
Did you miss me?

31:00.484 --> 31:02.611
Are we doing
the "no sleeping" thing again?

31:05.739 --> 31:07.491
- Pretty predictable, huh?

31:07.491 --> 31:09.785
- I wouldn't say that.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.430
Kind of worried about you.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.517
The not sleeping.

31:33.517 --> 31:34.893
- Don't be.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.438
It just gets weird at night.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.023
Kind of hard to describe.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.402
- Try.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.659
- It's like...

31:50.659 --> 31:52.452
spinning.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.038
Or, like, a spinning feeling.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.668
It gets worse
when I close my eyes,

31:59.668 --> 32:01.044
when everything's quiet.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.506
It's like my thoughts
keep happening all at once,

32:04.506 --> 32:08.677
but I can't focus
on any one of them.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.429
So it just turns
into this massive spiral.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.726
So I just stay awake.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.897
- Have you thought
about talking to someone?

32:22.607 --> 32:24.609
- I started taking meds.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.944
Prozac.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.113
- Is it helping?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.322
- I don't know.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.375
I get scared sometimes.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.798
Never told anyone that before.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.800
- You can literally
tell me anything.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.387
I love you.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.052
- You okay?

34:57.304 --> 34:59.472
Can't turn
my goddamn brain off.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.768
You know, he promised me,

35:03.768 --> 35:06.062
after the first time.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.274
He promised he wouldn't do
anything like that ever again.

35:10.859 --> 35:14.195
And I must've asked him
a thousand times,

35:14.195 --> 35:16.865
"Are you okay?"

35:16.865 --> 35:20.076
And a thousand times,
he said, "Yeah."

35:23.538 --> 35:26.916
There was a minute today...

35:26.916 --> 35:29.377
when I forgot.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.546
Just a minute.

35:35.008 --> 35:38.970
And then I remembered,
and it was like he...

35:38.970 --> 35:41.514
he died all over again.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.142
And I feel guilty
all over again.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.608
Five minutes.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.820
What?

35:58.031 --> 36:00.742
- I was five minutes away
from that parking lot.

36:02.869 --> 36:06.164
I mean, why didn't he call me?

36:14.923 --> 36:17.801
- The hell is all this?

36:17.801 --> 36:20.512
- Oh, uh,
early birthday present

36:20.512 --> 36:23.473
from our friendly
neighborhood detective, Gordon.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.141
- The Roy case?

36:25.141 --> 36:27.435
- Phone records
from the Roy kid's phone

36:27.435 --> 36:31.272
and every text Carter sent
in the last two years.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.776
- "Hey, it's Michelle. LOL.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.654
You're gonna think I'm weird.
Ha-ha, don't be mad."

36:39.447 --> 36:41.074
How long have you been here?

36:41.074 --> 36:43.201
- Oh, like...

36:43.201 --> 36:45.453
three years, 14 hours.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.996
- Buy you a drink?

36:46.996 --> 36:49.499
- No, no, I should stay.
Thank you.

36:49.499 --> 36:53.712
- Katie, only bad work
happens after 10:00.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.215
Come on.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.555
We all said shitty things
in high school.

37:03.555 --> 37:07.559
I don't envy these kids.
Every word recorded.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.352
- Why, why did she lie
to her friends

37:09.352 --> 37:11.521
about not knowing
where Conrad was?

37:11.521 --> 37:12.897
- Mm-mm-mm.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.566
- You know who lies?
Guilty people.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.235
- You know who lies?
Teenagers.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.363
Six ball, corner.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.031
- It's not like I don't see
what's at stake here.

37:22.031 --> 37:25.910
I mean, if we tried this,
it would be precedent-setting.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.289
- Look, I get it.
You're hungry.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.416
Every case for you
is another rung on the ladder,

37:31.416 --> 37:34.586
so every case has to be
solid enough to stand on.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.797
Your future's
just dangling there,

37:37.797 --> 37:39.799
waiting to be snatched up.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.511
Eight ball, side.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.267
- Wait, how long
have I been drinking?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.268
- Your break.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.700
Huh.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.412
- I'm more of a solo,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.414
noncontact,
figure skating girl.

38:11.414 --> 38:15.084
- Here, it's all about...

38:15.084 --> 38:16.419
seeing the whole game.

38:17.670 --> 38:18.838
What do you see?

38:20.507 --> 38:22.717
- A bunch
of different-colored balls.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.679
- Okay, what happens if I hit
the nine in the corner?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.473
- It bounces off the wall.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.350
- Yeah, and when it lands,
I better be setting myself up

38:30.350 --> 38:32.310
for the 14
to hit the left side

38:32.310 --> 38:34.604
and then 10 after that
and so on.

38:34.604 --> 38:38.817
Every choice I make
has to be about the end goal.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.026
Doesn't look,
you know, so pretty

38:40.026 --> 38:41.444
when it's all out there
on the table,

38:41.444 --> 38:42.779
but when you put it together--

38:42.779 --> 38:43.988
- Wait.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.452
Thank you.
- Okay.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.998
- It's like you said,
seeing the whole table.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.459
I--I was only looking
at the texts

38:56.459 --> 38:57.669
that she sent to the kid.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.963
I didn't think
that her friends were...

39:02.757 --> 39:05.260
To Natalie something.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.011
A few weeks after the funeral.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.721
She told him
to get back in the truck.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.683
It is practically
a goddamn confession.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.226
- It's something.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.854
- You know, I'm gonna need
a second chair on this.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.358
What?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.776
- I just want to make sure
we do this

39:21.776 --> 39:23.486
because there's a case,

39:23.486 --> 39:25.363
not because
it's one of those rungs.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.783
- Well...

39:28.783 --> 39:30.076
it is, and it is.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.205
How are you gonna
get around the fact

39:34.205 --> 39:36.958
that assisted suicide
is not illegal?

39:36.958 --> 39:39.085
- I'll take that as a yes.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.407
The DA opened
an official investigation

42:56.407 --> 42:59.243
into your connection
with the death of Conrad Roy.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.953
- But I didn't do
anything wrong.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.580
- You think she'll go to jail?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.500
- I will do everything in
my power to make that happen.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.337
<i>We need motive.</i>

43:09.337 --> 43:10.755
An assisted suicide
is not illegal

43:10.755 --> 43:11.923
in the state of Massachusetts.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.591
- Right, but she isn't
assisting.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.592
She's masterminding.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.594
- I just wanted to help him.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.179
Maybe I should call your mom.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.890
- If you ever tell anyone
about me,

43:20.890 --> 43:23.726
I will never talk to you again!

43:23.726 --> 43:26.312
- Carter has waived her right
to a jury trial,

43:26.312 --> 43:27.688
<i>which means the judge alone</i>

43:27.688 --> 43:30.525
<i>will decide whether or not</i>
<i>she is guilty.</i>

43:30.525 --> 43:33.694
- Her behavior was wanton
and reckless.

43:33.694 --> 43:36.572
There are text
<i>messages, thousands of them.</i>

43:36.572 --> 43:38.825
- She told him to drink bleach.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.370
- The night of his death,

43:42.370 --> 43:45.248
did you tell him
to get back in the truck?

43:45.248 --> 43:46.624
- I loved him.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.502
- She knew him.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.671
<i>She knew he was depressed.</i>

43:51.671 --> 43:53.673
- Tried to help you
the best I could.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.967
<i>I could never</i>
<i>talk you out of it.</i>

43:55.967 --> 43:58.719
- She knew what it was like
to feel lonely.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.513
- There's no one left.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.932
Your Honor,
<i>this is not a homicide case.</i>

44:02.932 --> 44:04.809
- She put him in that car
that night.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.520
- She was 30 miles away.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.480
I should have
<i>been there for you.</i>
