WEBVTT

00:08.775 --> 00:11.744
Heart, heart, heart...

00:11.811 --> 00:13.779
just one more heart.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.712
You might as well
be showing us

00:15.782 --> 00:17.249
your hand, Neelix.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.718
This is a game of
strategy, deception.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.414
Never let the opponents
know your hand.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.081
Right.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.818
Right.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.327
Ten.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.368
l see your ten and raise you 20.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.167
Neelix?

00:38.238 --> 00:40.604
l'm thinking...

00:42.709 --> 00:45.872
20... another 20.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.141
lf l didn't
know any better,

00:48.214 --> 00:50.182
l'd say we're being hustled.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.182
Ensign...

00:51.251 --> 00:52.343
Oh, l'm not buying

00:52.419 --> 00:53.716
the innocent Talaxian routine.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.015
l don't know what
you're talking about.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.522
l've-l've... This is
the first time l've played...

00:57.590 --> 00:58.522
What is it called?

00:58.591 --> 01:00.024
Poker.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.288
Look, why don't
we make things

01:01.327 --> 01:02.385
a little more interesting?

01:02.462 --> 01:04.453
Forget the chips.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.465
Let's bet on tomorrow's
work detail, all right?

01:06.533 --> 01:09.093
Whoever wins this hand
gets the morning off.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.464
l'm in.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.161
l'm in.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.465
Sounds good to me.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.073
What have you got?

01:15.175 --> 01:16.642
Two pair.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.303
Does... does that beat a flush?

01:19.379 --> 01:21.142
l knew you were bluffing.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.808
That beats me. Tom?

01:28.521 --> 01:30.489
Battle stations!

01:32.692 --> 01:35.160
And l had a full house.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.374 --> 03:30.899
l can't shake 'em.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.307
Return fire.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.574
Why didn't our sensors
detect them?

03:35.648 --> 03:37.275
lt looks like they used
a dispersal field

03:37.350 --> 03:39.614
to mask their approach.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.244
Warp drive?

03:41.321 --> 03:45.087
No luck. Too much damage
to the plasma injectors.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.888
Harry, get down there
and see what you can do.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.527
Shields down 18 percent.

03:55.635 --> 03:56.761
Harry, status?

03:56.869 --> 03:59.337
l need time
to clear the injectors.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.131
Sir, the cube's power output
is fluctuating.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.211
Then we're still in the game.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.836
Bring us about.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.177
Target their propulsion matrix.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.241
We've lost phasers.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.946
Arm photon torpedoes.
Fire when ready.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.617
We knocked out
their main propulsion system.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.125
Good.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.163
Now get us out
of here, Tom.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.762
They've got us
in a tractor beam.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.892
Harry,

04:29.035 --> 04:30.730
we need warp power now.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.896
We lost two more relays.
l can't!

04:35.808 --> 04:38.402
Harry?

04:38.478 --> 04:39.945
Harry?!

04:42.882 --> 04:43.940
Engines are off-line.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.574
We are the Borg.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.143
Your biological and
technological distinctiveness

04:48.221 --> 04:49.745
will be added to our own.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.483
Resistance is futile.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.879
Neelix.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.710
Neelix!

05:16.783 --> 05:18.216
Commander?

05:18.284 --> 05:19.251
lt's all right.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.479
You were unconscious,

05:20.553 --> 05:22.214
but l don't think
you're injured.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.552
l was dreaming you'd
been assimilated.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.558
Your subconscious
was jumping the gun,

05:26.626 --> 05:28.389
but not by much.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.224
From the look of this room,

05:30.296 --> 05:33.732
l'd say we're
in an assimilation chamber.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.392
Where's Harry?

05:35.501 --> 05:36.900
He's not here.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.561
Well, we've got to find him.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.730
We need to get
our bearings first,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.102
figure out what's going on.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.268
We're in a Borg cube,
and Harry's missing.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.606
That's what's going on.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.077
Sir...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.013
Nobody we know.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.556
Some kind of botched
assimilation?

05:59.625 --> 06:02.492
From the looks of it.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.052
What are they waiting for?

06:04.130 --> 06:07.099
They've got three more
potential drones here!

06:07.166 --> 06:08.155
Stay calm.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.495
Calm? We're in the
chamber of horrors,

06:09.602 --> 06:10.660
or haven't you noticed?

06:10.770 --> 06:11.828
We're not drones yet.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.998
lf we keep our heads,
maybe we can find a way out.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.872
There's a force field
around this room.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.913
Let's try to disable it.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.217
Their ion trail ends
directly ahead.

06:29.288 --> 06:33.884
l'm detecting another vessel,
bearing 30 mark 1 12.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.552
lt's a Borg cube.

06:35.628 --> 06:36.890
Red Alert.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.555
Alter course to intercept.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.565
Adjust shields
to rotating frequencies.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.066
Have they detected us?

06:42.168 --> 06:44.227
Unclear. The vessel's
holding position.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.895
As soon as we're
within sensor range,

06:46.005 --> 06:47.836
start scanning
for the away team.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.898
On screen.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.670
Their propulsion system
is off-line.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.440
The damage is not that severe.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.778
The drones should've
repaired it by now.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.111
Lucky for us they didn't,

06:58.184 --> 06:59.811
or we'd never have
caught up with them.

06:59.886 --> 07:00.750
Any sign
of our people?

07:00.853 --> 07:03.083
Not yet.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.488
They are targeting
our warp core.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.219
Shields are holding.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.817
Return fire.
Aim for their weapons array.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.231
Now they're going
after our impulse engines.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.963
That one was meant
for our sensors.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.001
They can't seem to make up

07:18.070 --> 07:19.162
their minds.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.832
Their attack strategy
is erratic, inefficient.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.932
And finished.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.772
We've disabled their weapons.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.143
That was too easy.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.478
Maybe they're in worse shape
than we thought.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.518
l'm picking up
non-Borg life signs.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.553
One of them is
definitely Talaxian.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.282
lt looks as though they haven't
been assimilated yet.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.722
Try to get a transporter lock.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.384
Their shields are interfering.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.725
Target their shield generator
and fire.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.356
Captain, l believe l can explain
the unusual behavior

07:46.432 --> 07:48.059
of these Borg.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.398
There should be thousands
of drones manning the vessel,

07:51.504 --> 07:53.904
but l'm picking up
only five signatures.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.840
We are the Borg.
You will be assimilated.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.275
Resistance is futile.

07:59.345 --> 08:01.472
lt doesn't sound like
they've lost their confidence.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.015
Their shield generators
are too deep inside the vessel.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.675
Our weapons can't reach them.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.379
Open a channel.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.818
Borg vessel, this is
the Starship Voyager.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.520
You're holding our crewmen.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.827
We're willing to cease firing
if you return them.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.832
Negotiation is irrelevant.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.402
You will be assimilated.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.870
Not today and not by you.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.669
Agree, or l'll resume firing.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.175
They are scanning us.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.879
We will return your crew members

08:35.982 --> 08:38.712
in exchange
for specific technology.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.275
Talk about unusual behavior.
The Borg negotiating?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.517
What technology?

08:44.590 --> 08:46.217
Your navigational deflector.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.385
Disengage it
from your secondary hull.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.792
Mute audio.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.059
lf we surrender our deflector,
we'll be dead in space.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.497
We won't be able
to go to warp.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.727
What would they
want with it?

08:55.835 --> 08:57.803
When their communications
array was damaged,

08:57.904 --> 09:00.065
it severed their link
to the collective.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.801
They intend to adapt
our deflector to regain it.

09:02.942 --> 09:06.139
And call for reinforcements?
That's the last thing we need.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.645
We'll have to stall them

09:07.713 --> 09:10.409
until we can find
another way out of this.

09:12.351 --> 09:16.151
l'll consider the exchange,
but first l want to be certain

09:16.222 --> 09:17.746
my crewmen are unharmed
and alive.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.815
You have scanned our vessel.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.985
Our scans were inconclusive.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.189
We want to see them
for ourselves.

09:27.266 --> 09:30.758
You may transport
one individual.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.603
Seven.

10:07.506 --> 10:12.637
Proceed to Grid 63,
Subjunction 01.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.688
State your designation.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.890
Seven of Nine.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.230
These drones
have not fully matured.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.324
Where are the others?

11:10.436 --> 11:12.370
There are no others.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.565
The drones
aboard this vessel were...

11:14.674 --> 11:16.437
deactivated.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.636
We are the Borg.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.916
Seven of Nine--

11:25.985 --> 11:27.282
a Borg designation.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.615
She's like us.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.280
Not like us.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.721
She's damaged.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.726
Her infrastructure
has been removed.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.227
We could fix her.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.593
You will add to
our perfection.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.791
You are neonatal drones.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.629
You should still be
in maturation chambers.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.168
We've matured long enough.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.966
Doubtful. Your thoracic nodes
haven't formed yet.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.131
You're incomplete.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.106
You'll continue
to malfunction.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.806
You must return
to your maturation chambers.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.404
Comply.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.881
Don't listen to her.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.474
We tried to go back in.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.951
The chambers were off-line.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.248
What happened
to the adult drones?

12:03.322 --> 12:04.550
We don't know.

12:04.623 --> 12:05.555
lrrelevant.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.387
Don't tell her anything.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.624
This vessel has been
severely damaged.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.563
You won't be able
to repair it alone.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.895
l can help you,

12:16.001 --> 12:18.663
but first you must
release the hostages.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.864
That wasn't the agreement.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.201
l've modified
the agreement.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.139
l didn't realize l'd be
dealing with children.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.643
Your behavior is erratic.

12:25.711 --> 12:26.939
l can't be certain that you...

12:27.079 --> 12:29.479
No modifications.

12:29.548 --> 12:33.814
We show you the hostages;
you give us the deflector.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.513
Comply.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.319
Comply.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.298
Take me to them.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.366
lf she tries to resist...

12:57.476 --> 12:59.967
assimilate her.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.225
Do you have a designation?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.056
Second.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.390
You were the second

13:17.463 --> 13:18.725
to emerge from the chambers.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.891
No, the first.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.434
l could not establish order.

13:23.502 --> 13:27.939
l became second...
and he became first.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.942
So you've established
a chain of command--

13:31.076 --> 13:31.940
a hierarchy.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.704
We're a collective.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.940
A collective of
five on a vessel

13:36.015 --> 13:38.483
normally run by 5,000.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.849
What makes you think
you'll survive?

13:40.920 --> 13:44.185
When we reestablish
our link with the Borg,

13:44.256 --> 13:46.417
they will come for us.

13:57.803 --> 14:00.966
Commander, we've got company.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.078
l wish to see
if they're injured.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.051
-Seven?
-Don't let their appearance

14:14.119 --> 14:16.451
fool you. They are in control
of this vessel

14:16.522 --> 14:18.285
and all of its armaments.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.551
Are you injured?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.593
Nothing serious.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.661
The previous tenant.

14:26.732 --> 14:30.190
We were trying to perfect
our assimilation techniques.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.735
You failed.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.533
One of these captives
was attempting

14:33.639 --> 14:35.607
to disconnect
the security field.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.697
Actually, l was

14:36.809 --> 14:37.503
just trying to...

14:39.211 --> 14:41.577
That was unnecessary.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.114
He is not
permanently damaged.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.650
He learned his lesson.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.950
The Borg are prepared

14:53.025 --> 14:55.323
to negotiate for your release.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.453
l will return for you.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.729
Give my regards to Harry.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.270
The deflector array.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.278
l'm not authorized

15:15.347 --> 15:16.871
to give you technology.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.507
l must report back
to Captain Janeway.

15:22.521 --> 15:23.886
Agreed.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.184
l also need to take
an adult drone

15:26.258 --> 15:28.556
and a datanode back
to Voyager for analysis.

15:28.627 --> 15:29.889
Why?

15:29.995 --> 15:31.553
Something happened
on this vessel

15:31.630 --> 15:32.892
that none of us understand.

15:32.965 --> 15:36.332
lf it happens again,
it could endanger all of you.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.369
No sign of Harry yet,
but there are parts

15:46.445 --> 15:48.345
of the cube that
we still can't scan.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.779
Could the drones
be holding him

15:49.848 --> 15:50.940
in another location?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.948
Unlikely. Seven said
they didn't seem

15:53.018 --> 15:54.610
to be aware of his presence.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.245
lf he ejected
in an escape pod,

15:56.322 --> 15:58.415
we would have detected
his beacon by now.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.957
Try to activate his combadge.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.220
Match the carrier wave to
a Borg interlink frequency.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.693
They shouldn't detect it.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.195
Aye, Captain.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.462
What have we learned
from our friend here?

16:09.568 --> 16:13.197
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

16:13.305 --> 16:17.901
Behold the David
that slew our Goliath.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.272
A pathogen?

16:21.347 --> 16:22.644
A spaceborne virus
that adapted

16:22.715 --> 16:23.773
to Borg physiology.

16:23.849 --> 16:24.873
lt's inert now,

16:24.950 --> 16:26.178
but in its virulent state,

16:26.251 --> 16:28.185
it attacked the drones
and killed them.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.380
Why weren't
the juveniles infected?

16:30.456 --> 16:31.548
The maturation
chamber is designed

16:31.623 --> 16:32.885
to protect
developing drones.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.391
Malfunctions caused

16:34.460 --> 16:35.688
by the deaths of the adults

16:35.761 --> 16:38.059
lead several of the chambers
to open prematurely.

16:38.130 --> 16:41.031
Does this pathogen
only target the Borg?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.660
The Borg and other
cybernetic organisms

16:43.769 --> 16:44.701
it encounters.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.397
You're not thinking
of using it

16:46.505 --> 16:47.733
as a biological weapon.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.364
lf we can revive
the pathogen

16:49.475 --> 16:52.239
and reintroduce it,
we could neutralize the drones

16:52.311 --> 16:53.938
without harming
the away team.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.107
Neutralize? You mean
''murder,'' don't you?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.274
Captain, they're children.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.545
Need l remind you
that these ''children''

17:00.619 --> 17:02.314
have committed
murder themselves

17:02.388 --> 17:04.982
in their futile attempts
to assimilate others.

17:05.057 --> 17:05.989
Seven...

17:06.058 --> 17:08.151
tell me something.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.058
You saw them,

17:10.128 --> 17:11.221
talked to them.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.491
Do you think
they'll kill the hostages

17:13.565 --> 17:15.192
if we don't give them
what they want?

17:18.436 --> 17:20.233
Yes.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.304
l want that pathogen
as an option, Doctor,

17:25.377 --> 17:27.867
but l won't consider
using it until l've seen

17:27.945 --> 17:29.573
these drones for myself.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.513
Think you can arrange that?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.915
Then you're with me.

18:08.287 --> 18:12.087
Computer, identify the source
of this com signal.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.149
Starship Voyager.

18:15.227 --> 18:18.663
l need to respond
on the same carrier wave.

18:18.730 --> 18:22.860
That procedure will require
significant modifications.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.234
Well, don't worry.
l'm way ahead of you.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.493
Why are you here?

18:49.561 --> 18:52.257
l wanted to make
a new proposal.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.323
We've already negotiated.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.804
You've seen the hostages.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.272
Now give us the
deflector as agreed.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.604
Maybe it's hard
for you to accept,

19:04.643 --> 19:07.407
but you don't have
to rejoin the hive.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.037
Our Doctor can remove

19:09.114 --> 19:11.139
your implants,
you can come with us.

19:11.216 --> 19:14.151
You were individuals
yourselves not long ago--

19:14.219 --> 19:16.278
children with families.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.256
You were abducted
and assimilated.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.494
l recognize your species.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.121
You're Brunali.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.391
And you're Norcadian.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.401
Do you remember your world?

19:31.470 --> 19:33.870
A Theta-Class planetoid.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.133
Population: 260 million.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.505
Binary suns.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.273
And what did it look like
when those suns set each night?

19:41.346 --> 19:42.574
Can you remember that?

19:42.648 --> 19:43.706
lrrelevant!

19:43.782 --> 19:45.613
The deflector, now.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.878
We need more time.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.782
That deflector array
is essential to our...

19:48.854 --> 19:49.616
No.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.284
Give it to us.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.848
Or what? You'll assimilate me?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.758
That won't solve your problem.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.160
l can't give you
Voyager's deflector,

19:59.231 --> 20:00.698
but maybe we can repair

20:00.766 --> 20:02.859
your technology.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.902
Clarify.

20:04.970 --> 20:09.270
Seven knows a good deal
about Borg systems.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.434
You have two hours.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.444
l don't know
the extent of the damage.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.843
lt could take longer.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.313
Two hours...

20:17.382 --> 20:19.748
or your hostages die.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.683
Don't come back here, Captain.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.505
l bought us another two hours.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.913
The pathogen?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.246
lt should be ready by then.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.479
Did you see the away team?

20:55.554 --> 20:56.578
l'm afraid not.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.351
But Seven assured me
our people haven't been harmed.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.948
l can't believe
we're negotiating

21:01.059 --> 21:02.287
with adolescent drones.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.851
They're not exactly drones.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.521
Mature Borg are predictable.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.656
They'll ignore you
or assimilate you,

21:07.733 --> 21:10.167
but these... juveniles,
they're unstable.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.998
They are contemptuous
of authority,

21:12.104 --> 21:13.833
convinced
that they are superior--

21:13.939 --> 21:17.670
typical adolescent behavior
for any species.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.836
lt's a transmission...

21:19.911 --> 21:21.344
from the cube.

21:21.413 --> 21:22.243
Seven?

21:22.314 --> 21:23.281
No.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.940
lt's Harry.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.644
l'm clearing it up now.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.716
Delta Flyer to Voyager.
Respond.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.313
We're receiving you, Ensign.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.323
Where are you?

21:33.392 --> 21:34.586
Still in the Flyer.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.128
lt's locked up
in some kind of hangar bay

21:37.195 --> 21:38.890
along with two alien ships.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.693
l've isolated his coordinates.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.393
How close is he

21:42.467 --> 21:44.128
to their shield generator?

21:44.236 --> 21:45.396
Roughly 800 meters.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.802
Harry, are there
any plasma charges

21:47.873 --> 21:49.135
aboard the Flyer?

21:49.207 --> 21:50.504
Yes, ma'am.

21:50.575 --> 21:51.940
ln that case,
how do you feel

21:52.010 --> 21:53.477
about going for
a little walk?

21:53.545 --> 21:55.012
l could use the exercise.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.945
Tuvok will guide you
to the shield generator.

21:58.016 --> 22:01.474
lf you destroy it, you won't
have to make the trip back.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.952
Understood.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.263
l have the technology
you've requested.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.496
Thank you.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.941
You were a drone for 18 years.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.375
Correct.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.643
l accessed your datafile.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.742
Why?

22:33.819 --> 22:37.186
l thought
it might be relevant.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.849
What else did you learn?

22:40.926 --> 22:43.895
You were assimilated
as a juvenile, like us.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.827
My parents were scientists

22:45.897 --> 22:47.626
studying the Borg.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.963
They took me with them.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.298
My childhood was short.

22:52.404 --> 22:53.632
Childhood?

22:53.739 --> 22:57.266
The years between birth
and physical maturity,

22:57.376 --> 22:58.934
when humanoids adapt

22:59.044 --> 23:01.604
to their roles as individuals.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.910
Perhaps you have memory
of yours.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.244
l don't know.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.218
What about your parents?

23:08.286 --> 23:10.982
Do you remember them?

23:12.591 --> 23:13.523
No.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.753
No memories.

23:15.827 --> 23:18.660
Your subvocal processor
is malfunctioning.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.391
l can repair it for you.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.165
lt's a slight adjustment.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.869
lt won't be painful.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.471
The first told me

23:34.546 --> 23:36.707
my malfunction
could not be repaired,

23:36.782 --> 23:39.376
until we reconnected
with the collective.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.723
This color...

23:49.795 --> 23:51.820
My mother's hair...

23:51.897 --> 23:53.524
was this color.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.395
l thought we agreed--

23:55.467 --> 23:57.697
no irrelevant discussions.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.862
What is the punishment

23:59.971 --> 24:01.700
for disobeying the protocols?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.240
Deactivation.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.870
l engaged him in
this discussion.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.812
Return to your station.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.330
l found some
unsettling information.

24:33.438 --> 24:36.305
l examined their
communication records.

24:36.374 --> 24:37.341
The collective did receive

24:37.409 --> 24:38.876
the drones' initial
distress call.

24:38.944 --> 24:42.277
How long before they arrive?

24:42.347 --> 24:44.372
A vessel was not dispatched.

24:44.449 --> 24:45.643
The collective declared

24:45.717 --> 24:47.309
the neonatal
drones irrelevant

24:47.385 --> 24:49.512
and severed their link
to the hive permanently.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.421
They see them as damaged,
unworthy of reassimilation.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.480
Precisely.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.219
Are the drones aware of this?

24:55.293 --> 24:57.557
No. They don't
have the ability

24:57.629 --> 25:00.154
to decrypt the message.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.564
Once they learn they've
been rejected by the hive,

25:02.667 --> 25:04.635
they won't need our deflector.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.704
They might be willing
to release the hostages.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.773
Normally when drones
learn they're irrelevant,

25:08.874 --> 25:10.842
they deactivate themselves.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.068
But these neonatal drones
are unpredictable.

25:13.144 --> 25:16.739
They may not adhere
to Borg protocols.

25:19.384 --> 25:20.817
There is another option.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.852
We could invite them
to Voyager.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.654
When they realize they have
no place else to go...

25:28.727 --> 25:29.887
lf you're suggesting

25:30.028 --> 25:32.053
transforming them
into individuals,

25:32.130 --> 25:33.688
that would be
extremely difficult.

25:33.765 --> 25:36.734
You turned out
pretty well, Seven.

25:36.835 --> 25:40.669
That's because l was prepared
before you encountered me.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.229
What do you mean?

25:42.340 --> 25:46.538
When l was first captured
by the Borg,

25:46.611 --> 25:49.273
l was young and frightened.

25:49.347 --> 25:52.942
l watched my parents
assimilated.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.679
Then l was placed
in a maturation chamber,

25:55.754 --> 25:58.086
and the hive mind began
to restructure

25:58.156 --> 26:01.956
my synaptic pathways,
purge my individuality.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.757
When l emerged five years later,

26:04.829 --> 26:07.195
the turmoil
of my forced assimilation

26:07.265 --> 26:10.063
had been replaced with order.

26:10.168 --> 26:13.365
You may not be aware
of this, Captain,

26:13.471 --> 26:17.874
but that order continues to be
a source of strength for me.

26:17.943 --> 26:21.106
l could not have regained
my humanity without it.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.342
l appreciate your insights.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.550
But just because they
didn't have the benefit

26:28.620 --> 26:30.349
of your Borg upbringing,

26:30.422 --> 26:32.890
doesn't mean we're going
to turn our backs on them.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.322
There has to be another way.

26:34.392 --> 26:37.919
Not all drones
can be saved, Captain.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.898
Continue the repairs
aboard the Borg cube.

26:43.034 --> 26:46.697
We'll hold onto this
information for now.

26:46.805 --> 26:47.999
Yes, Captain.

26:48.106 --> 26:51.098
They do have one thing
going for them.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.339
You.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.210
lf there's anyone
who can reach them,

26:57.282 --> 26:59.182
it's you.

27:08.793 --> 27:12.285
Three of hearts
on a transwarp conduit.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.524
Ensign?

27:13.598 --> 27:16.590
King of clubs...

27:16.668 --> 27:18.397
on a power coupling.

27:18.503 --> 27:20.471
l'm marking my route

27:20.538 --> 27:23.507
with playing cards in case l
have to come back this same way.

27:23.608 --> 27:25.872
You shouldn't distract yourself,
Mr. Kim.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.878
l need a little distraction.

27:27.946 --> 27:32.042
This hike is bringing up
some bad memories.

27:32.117 --> 27:35.416
An earlier visit to a Borg cube?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.717
Nope, haunted house
my parents took me to

27:37.789 --> 27:39.154
when l was six.

27:39.224 --> 27:42.921
Borg vessels may be forbidding,
but they are not haunted.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.022
Tuvok?

27:47.098 --> 27:48.463
Turn left, Ensign.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.433
Nine of diamonds on a data node.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.406
The resonance field
collapsed.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.807
lt'll take an hour
to reinitialize.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.209
These delays are intentional.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.837
l'm working
as efficiently as l can.

28:03.882 --> 28:06.851
Examine my work for yourself
if you have doubts.

28:08.586 --> 28:10.315
This data's flawed.

28:10.388 --> 28:12.822
More likely it's
your understanding

28:12.957 --> 28:14.686
of quadric field
theory that's flawed.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.784
lgnore her.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.192
She's trying to divide us.

28:18.263 --> 28:20.231
They rely on you.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.698
Yet you lack the skills
necessary to ensure

28:22.767 --> 28:23.825
their survival.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.232
We've managed so far.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.032
We're Borg.

28:28.139 --> 28:29.663
You've forgotten
what that means.

28:29.774 --> 28:32.504
The unity of the collective...

28:32.577 --> 28:34.568
common goals...

28:34.646 --> 28:35.874
the quest for perfection...

28:35.947 --> 28:38.347
l have not forgotten.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.883
But you don't need
to remain drones

28:39.984 --> 28:42.043
to experience those things.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.789
Come back with me to Voyager.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.887
38 minutes.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.621
You're wasting time.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.297
Another maturation chamber
is malfunctioning.

29:07.545 --> 29:10.070
lts autonomic nervous
system is failing.

29:10.148 --> 29:11.410
lt's Borg.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.417
lt will adapt.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.612
lt's not adapting.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.654
Let Seven help.

29:26.231 --> 29:28.825
We can modulate the stasis field
to stabilize its functions

29:28.967 --> 29:30.434
at least temporarily.

29:30.535 --> 29:31.763
Assist me.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.497
The field is degrading.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.300
We need to transport it

29:35.406 --> 29:36.805
into an incubation pod--
quickly.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.774
Why is it doing that?

30:14.846 --> 30:17.508
lt's respiratory
system is impaired.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.777
And this incubation pod
is malfunctioning.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.785
We must transport this
infant to Voyager.

30:21.853 --> 30:22.842
No.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.583
The drone is part
of our collective.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.627
Not if it dies.

30:39.737 --> 30:42.672
Tetryon levels are rising.
l'm getting closer.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.833
The shield generator
should be directly ahead.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.472
l see it.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.717
The first charge is in place.

31:02.126 --> 31:03.252
Tuvok?

31:20.011 --> 31:21.308
Hello?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.745
You left these.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.487
l like her.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.921
She looks like Seven of Nine.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.425
ls Seven your friend?

31:35.493 --> 31:37.484
You know, she's my friend, too.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.893
Maybe someday...

31:38.963 --> 31:41.363
Your weapon won't work here.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.423
Dampening field.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.004
How long has it been
since you lost contact?

31:48.072 --> 31:49.004
Four or five minutes.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.107
His bio-signs?

31:50.174 --> 31:51.641
Doctor to the Captain.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.472
Please report
to Sick Bay immediately.

31:53.544 --> 31:54.511
On my way.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.376
Keep looking for him.

31:57.782 --> 31:59.010
What's the emergency?

31:59.150 --> 32:01.311
l thought you should see
for yourself.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.512
Somebody left a bundle
on our doorstep.

32:03.554 --> 32:04.680
l turned around

32:04.756 --> 32:06.986
and there she was,
lying on a bio-bed.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.219
Seven must have
beamed her here.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.226
A good thing, too.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.785
A few more minutes

32:11.863 --> 32:15.526
and l wouldn't have been able
to do anything for her.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.864
lt's hard to believe
she could grow up

32:17.969 --> 32:20.563
to be a drone.

32:27.078 --> 32:29.979
Hold her for a moment
while l take some readings.

32:37.155 --> 32:42.024
Oh. l guess she just
wanted to be held.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.329
Oh.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.191
The pathogen.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.793
l finished synthesizing it.

32:53.905 --> 32:56.373
Start working with Tuvok
on a way to deploy

32:56.474 --> 32:58.203
the virus.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.369
Captain, you don't
seriously plan to use it.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.446
lf l have to.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.543
Let's just hope your
brothers and sisters

33:07.618 --> 33:10.086
don't force my hand.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.452
You complain of delays,

33:13.524 --> 33:15.492
then you interrupt my work.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.824
Can you identify this?

33:19.297 --> 33:21.026
lt's a plasma charge.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.863
You tried to deceive us.

33:34.946 --> 33:37.881
Nanoprobes were injected
into his bloodstream.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.281
He won't survive
without medical attention.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.216
Call your Captain.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.083
Tell her to give us
the deflector.

33:44.155 --> 33:45.452
That won't be necessary.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.320
l only need a few
more minutes to repair...

33:47.392 --> 33:48.950
No more delays.

33:49.093 --> 33:52.119
No more deceptions.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.163
The deflector.

33:57.668 --> 34:00.330
Resistance is futile.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.035
Comply.

34:07.111 --> 34:09.705
Return Harry Kim;
then we'll talk.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.248
We've talked enough.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.510
Your requests are irrelevant.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.451
Comply, or we'll assimilate
the others.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.659
lt'll take us at least an hour
to dismantle the deflector

34:23.728 --> 34:24.717
and transfer the components...

34:24.795 --> 34:25.728
Now.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.163
l can't give it to you now.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.065
lt's complex technology
that's part of our ship.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.636
We can't simply remove it,

34:32.737 --> 34:34.670
and no amount
of threats from you

34:34.739 --> 34:36.764
is going to change that.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.141
They've locked a tractor beam
onto the deflector.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.612
They're trying
to tear it off.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.806
Hull stress is increasing.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.179
Breaches on Decks 10 and 1 1.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.152
lncrease shield strength
and randomize the harmonics.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.721
They're adapting.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.360
Even with Voyager's
deflector,

35:02.433 --> 35:04.424
your efforts to
return to the hive

35:04.535 --> 35:05.627
will fail.

35:05.736 --> 35:07.670
They'll come for us.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.706
No, they won't.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.372
The Borg received your message,

35:13.444 --> 35:15.173
but chose to ignore it.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.737
They consider you irrelevant.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.407
lrrelevant?

35:19.484 --> 35:20.883
We are damaged.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.816
They don't want us.

35:22.887 --> 35:24.514
lgnore her.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.113
lt's another lie.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.853
Their reply is
in data grid 426.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.724
Use decryption
protocol theta-3.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.525
Return to your station.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.538
lt's another deception.

35:48.613 --> 35:51.309
She's manipulating us.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.942
The transmission
is authentic.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.220
lt's a mistake.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.724
The collective does not
tolerate imperfection.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.454
Then we'll assimilate
more species...

36:04.495 --> 36:06.725
prove we're worthy.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.298
Hull stress is reaching
critical levels.

36:12.403 --> 36:14.667
Reroute all emergency power
to structural integrity.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.570
That'll buy us
another minute at most.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.872
Captain, l found a fluctuation

36:19.977 --> 36:21.877
in their shield grid
near a plasma duct.

36:21.979 --> 36:24.470
lt's too intermittent
to beam out the hostages,

36:24.549 --> 36:27.017
but we could use it
to deploy the pathogen.

36:31.322 --> 36:32.687
Captain...

36:32.757 --> 36:34.054
Not yet.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.490
There is no alternative.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.187
There's always an alternative.

36:37.261 --> 36:38.694
We just need to find it.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.400
Their tractor
beam draws power

36:43.501 --> 36:45.526
from the same grid
as their shield matrix.

36:47.104 --> 36:48.230
lf we use the deflector

36:48.339 --> 36:50.364
to send a feedback pulse
along the beam,

36:50.474 --> 36:52.499
it could disrupt
their shields. Do it.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.272
Rerouting more plasma.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.278
lf this doesn't work,

36:56.347 --> 36:57.905
it'll do more damage
to us than the cube.

36:57.982 --> 36:58.949
lt'll work.

36:59.016 --> 36:59.948
Prepare to fire.

37:01.452 --> 37:05.684
You have no future
with the Borg...

37:05.756 --> 37:07.417
but you do with Voyager--

37:07.491 --> 37:10.426
a chance to reclaim
your real lives.

37:10.494 --> 37:13.258
What do you know
about real lives?

37:14.799 --> 37:17.199
Does he speak
for all of you?

37:17.301 --> 37:20.065
You should make your
decisions yourself,

37:20.171 --> 37:21.229
as individuals.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.178
They are sending
a feedback pulse

37:28.246 --> 37:29.736
through our tractor beam.

37:29.814 --> 37:32.305
lt's overloading
our shield matrix.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.351
Adapt!

37:39.724 --> 37:40.656
Their tractor beam

37:40.725 --> 37:41.657
is fluctuating.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.057
Their shields are dropping.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.822
l've got a partial lock
on the away team.

37:44.895 --> 37:46.726
Boosting the confinement beam.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.094
l've got three of them.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.792
Confirmed.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.802
Chakotay, Paris and Neelix
are in Transporter Room 2.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.269
What about Seven and Harry?

37:54.338 --> 37:55.737
They must be in a section

37:55.806 --> 37:56.773
that's still shielded.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.706
Amplify the feedback pulse.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.507
The other captives are gone.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.641
The shields around this chamber
are failing.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.310
lnstructions.

38:15.493 --> 38:16.858
Lower your shields.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.364
Lower the shields!

38:27.004 --> 38:28.028
No!

38:41.819 --> 38:43.013
Leave her alone.

38:43.087 --> 38:45.214
Get back to your station.

38:45.289 --> 38:47.883
Do what l say.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.323
What you say?

38:49.393 --> 38:51.384
l thought we were
a collective.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.396
One mind, one voice.

38:53.464 --> 38:56.297
l protected you...

38:56.367 --> 38:58.358
gave you order.

38:58.469 --> 38:59.401
Your order.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.529
Your rules.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.437
Their feedback pulse
is overloading

39:04.508 --> 39:06.100
the induction grids.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.178
This vessel will be destroyed.

39:12.249 --> 39:13.580
We must evacuate.

39:13.651 --> 39:14.709
No!

39:14.785 --> 39:16.377
Assist me!

39:30.768 --> 39:32.429
You're damaged. Lie still.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.334
We have to resist.

39:35.406 --> 39:38.398
The collective will come for us.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.579
His cortical implants
are depolarizing.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.112
l can't help him.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.256
We'll find a new home.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.293
You'll see.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.025
W-we are Borg.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.859
Yes.

40:04.969 --> 40:06.766
We are Borg.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.018
Lower the shields.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.195
Captain's Log, supplemental.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.966
Harry is recovering
in Sick Bay,

40:43.073 --> 40:45.132
and the rest of the away team
is safe and sound.

40:45.242 --> 40:46.368
As for the drones,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.309
the Doctor's removed
most of their implants,

40:48.379 --> 40:51.246
leaving us with four
very troubled children.

40:51.315 --> 40:52.247
We've sent out calls

40:52.316 --> 40:54.011
to any Brunali
and Norcadian ships

40:54.118 --> 40:55.642
that might be
in the vicinity,

40:55.719 --> 40:57.482
but we haven't gotten
any responses so far,

40:57.555 --> 40:59.022
and we're still
trying to figure out

40:59.089 --> 41:00.886
where the other
two came from.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.549
lt may take a while.

41:02.593 --> 41:04.026
They could use the time.

41:04.094 --> 41:06.028
They have a great deal
to learn.

41:06.096 --> 41:08.394
lt might help if they
had someone around

41:08.466 --> 41:10.400
who knew what
they're up against.

41:12.002 --> 41:14.129
l've never been responsible
for children.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.706
Mr. Neelix would be
a wiser choice.

41:16.774 --> 41:17.798
From what l've seen,

41:17.908 --> 41:20.274
you're the one
they've established a bond with.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.403
They'll be looking to you
for guidance.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.615
Perhaps l could...

41:25.683 --> 41:27.378
help them avoid
some of the obstacles

41:27.451 --> 41:28.816
l've encountered.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.859
Do we have to regenerate now?

41:38.929 --> 41:40.362
Yes.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.558
But first...

41:42.633 --> 41:44.294
l was able to salvage

41:44.401 --> 41:46.369
your assimilation profiles.

41:46.470 --> 41:48.461
They include your names
and some limited

41:48.572 --> 41:49.766
biographical data.

41:49.874 --> 41:51.967
lcheb.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.269
My name was lcheb.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.575
Your name is lcheb.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.945
l remember now.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.416
lt was my father's second name.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.887
My designation is Mezoti.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.352
lt-it's a pretty name.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.656
Yes, it is...

42:11.729 --> 42:13.594
and it's all yours.

42:18.168 --> 42:19.294
Azan

42:19.403 --> 42:20.893
and Rebi...

42:21.071 --> 42:23.335
l'll tell you more
about them tomorrow.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.982
Computer, decrease
ambient lighting by 60 percent.

42:38.789 --> 42:39.983
Good night.

42:47.765 --> 42:49.426
Sweet dreams.
