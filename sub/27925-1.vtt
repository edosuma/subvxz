(BABY GURGLING)

01:10.838 --> 01:12.506
FEMALE NURSE:
Is there a name yet?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.277
EMILY: His name is John.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.351
(AIRPLANE PASSING OVERHEAD)

01:35.796 --> 01:36.906
WOMAN: It's slipping.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.075
WOMAN: John.
Oh. I got it. I got it.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.111
John.
I got it. I got it.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.846
Something's missing.
What is it?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.281
I think I left it on the plane.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.851
Left what?
The diaper bag. It's not here.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.220
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna go back for it.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.288
I'm gonna go back.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.756
I'm gonna tear that plane
apart for you, alright?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.225
First, hold this.
Thank you.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.960
You goober.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.528
Daddy thinks he's so funny.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.963
Because I am funny.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.765
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

02:01.789 --> 02:04.201
Josh. Josh.
John.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.802
Josh.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.994
Where are you?

02:07.995 --> 02:09.806
Josh, where are you?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.975
Can you hear me, Josh?
John.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.143
I can't hear you.
He's right there.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.444
I see him.
I can't hear him. Where...

02:14.468 --> 02:15.479
There he is.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.547
Welcome to Utah.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.483
(LAUGHS)

02:19.507 --> 02:20.617
How's my favorite niece?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.786
You remember Uncle Joshy?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.121
Yeah, your uncle
Osh Kosh B'Gosh.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.990
Okay, Mr. John
Jacob Jingleheimer...

02:27.014 --> 02:29.015
All right, I'm done
with the nicknames.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.851
Hey, race you to the car.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.562
WOMAN: Whoa.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.921
Go ahead.

02:34.588 --> 02:40.428
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.927
MAN: So, it's doctor's school.
You cut anybody open yet?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.662
No, not yet.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.163
Stuff's harder
than it looks though.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.932
Between the books
and the diapers, I am sleeping

03:08.956 --> 03:11.868
at least a few times
a week, right, Ems?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.703
Is he...
Uh, who are you?

03:13.727 --> 03:14.804
(JOSH LAUGHING)

03:14.828 --> 03:16.206
I'm just kidding.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.175
No, he's on some crazy
new schedule, I think.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.011
A 36-hour a day would make
my life a lot easier.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.213
What have you been up to?

03:23.237 --> 03:25.515
Oh, just work and school,
trying to transfer out

03:25.539 --> 03:28.385
and get to a different
environment, I guess.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.720
Oh, you're still the kid that
wants to get away from home, huh?

03:30.744 --> 03:31.888
Yeah.
Well, I get it.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.023
But for the record,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.126
it'd have been nice
if I could've stayed.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.396
I'm glad
you're still here, though.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.254
I'm home.

03:40.255 --> 03:41.898
It wouldn't be home without you.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.132
Focus on driving.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.503
Yeah, I'll try to.
Well, you're almost home.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.704
What are you talking about?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.239
Hey, Em, there's
a box back there.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.641
It's a brown, rectangular...

03:51.665 --> 03:53.667
Send that up, that'd be great.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.413
Oh, wow. She's out.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.681
That was quick.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.340
She's a little juggernaut.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.610
No way!
You brought 'em?

04:03.611 --> 04:06.089
Hey, yes, I did.
Yes.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.591
I can't believe
you still have this.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.327
Does it still even work?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.229
You know it's heavy duty
if it survives Dad.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.433
These things'll be good for
another six generations, man.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.434
This is awesome.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.336
Yeah, thinking we've got
a little bit of time.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.238
We've got all this gear
just sitting here, right now.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.274
And Nutty Putty
just opened back up.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.009
Maybe it'd be...
Nutty Putty's open again?

04:26.033 --> 04:29.279
Yeah. So I think it would be
a great opportunity

04:29.303 --> 04:33.116
to show Emily
your great love for her

04:33.140 --> 04:35.084
by forgetting everything
I'm saying right now.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.787
Damage is done, Josh.
It's too late now.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.789
But I get him
for the rest of the trip.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.792
Yes! Yes, it is on. Yeah.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.794
You know, we have the whole

04:44.818 --> 04:46.796
rest of the vacation
to act like kids.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.321
Let's chill tonight.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.434
And then maybe tomorrow before
I have to go back to Virginia.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.036
After Thanksgiving we'll be
too fat to fit in the cave.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.270
Besides, you know Mom.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.605
She's not gonna let us
out of her sight

04:55.629 --> 04:58.274
once she has the whole flock
under one roof again.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.634
You're trying to hide it,
but I know you want to go.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.749
All right, dude, I get it.
I mean, caves are scary, so,

05:05.773 --> 05:08.452
I mean,
if you don't want to go...

05:08.476 --> 05:10.286
It's whatever,
you do what you gotta do.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.889
You could be more obvious
what you're doing.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.348
Uh-huh. Okay.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.020
I'm not scared.
You know that, right?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.457
I know there's a cave, we both
want to go to forever, but like...

05:25.125 --> 05:28.171
Hey, I said you could go.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.673
All right, I'm in.
Let's do it. Yes!

05:29.697 --> 05:30.697
Yes. Whoo!

05:30.698 --> 05:32.342
It's on!
(MOUTHING WORDS)

05:32.366 --> 05:33.501
Yes!

05:36.704 --> 05:38.147
Okay.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.517
For the record, that wasn't
a win that you just had, okay?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.586
You didn't manipulate me.
I had to think things through

05:42.610 --> 05:44.712
because I'm an adult,
I'm responsible...

05:47.481 --> 05:48.992
JOHN: I'm not scared of the cave.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.193
JOHN: There's nowhere to
be better than a cave.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.485
It doesn't make any sense.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.252
(IGNITION BEEPING)

06:26.720 --> 06:27.655
(BEEPING STOPS)

06:29.890 --> 06:31.501
All right.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.837
Hey, you wanna...
You want to change the batteries

06:33.861 --> 06:35.238
in your headlamp
just to be safe?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.040
We're only going
for a few hours so...

06:37.064 --> 06:38.708
Mmm...
All right, fine. Yeah.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.410
Hey, just give me a call

06:40.434 --> 06:41.811
when you're ready
to come home, okay?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.047
Okay.
I'd like to talk about some stuff.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.049
Oh, thanks. Stuff?
Yeah, stuff.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.418
What kind of stuff?
Oh, just you know...

06:48.442 --> 06:50.186
awesome Thanksgiving stuff,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.922
but I want
to talk about it tonight.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.280
About what?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.092
It's married people stuff, man.
You wouldn't understand.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.427
I don't want to know.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.786
I'm scared. I have no idea
what you're talking about,

06:58.886 --> 07:01.030
but you have my attention.
Good, then be quick.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.165
Okay.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.733
Ooh. I don't want
to lose this in there.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.936
Take that. Ah!

07:06.960 --> 07:09.405
It's going in the diaper bag?
I'm never seeing that again.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.440
Stop.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.265
Why don't you buy me
a new one then?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.746
All right, you win.
I love you.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.114
I love you, too.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.305
Have fun.
I will.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.574
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

07:22.810 --> 07:24.854
Drive safe.
See you later.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.780
I miss you.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.128
Ready to go?
Yeah.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.654
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.217
I really can't believe it.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.152
I didn't think they'd ever
open up this cave again.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.646
Yeah, it's been like two years
since they closed it.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.225
Only started letting people
back in in May.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.227
They make you jumps through
hoops for these permits.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.729
Permits?
Yeah, dude.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.664
It's like
a two-week wait to get 'em.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.523
That's a big gamble taking Ems
about my health.

08:09.623 --> 08:13.336
(CHUCKLES)
Dude, you're predictable.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.172
You gotta be known
for something.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.699
You coming?
Yeah.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.637
Good to be home.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.540
What do you think?
Six feet till it opens back up?

08:50.564 --> 08:53.566
Oh, are you crazy?
Come on, man.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.569
I'm the one scared
of everything, right?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.785
So what we're looking for
is The Birth Canal.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.787
It should be around
here somewhere.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.555
This is even one
of the easier squeezes

09:05.579 --> 09:07.290
'cause everybody has to do it.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.382
(BOTH PANTING AND STRUGGLING)

09:17.090 --> 09:20.536
Heh, and I give you the slide.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.696
JOSH: Let's do this.
JOHN: All right.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.055
This place is unreal.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.256
It's warm, too.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.258
Yeah, I did a lot of reading
on this monster

09:42.282 --> 09:44.594
before I got the permits.
Yeah?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.863
I guess, they haven't even
explored all of it yet.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.865
Back before they closed it,
they were getting like

09:48.889 --> 09:50.033
5,000 people a year.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.935
That's a lot of people going
to a cave that has no end.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.102
Right?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.403
Did they say why
it's called Nutty Putty?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.340
Yeah. I guess as you get
deeper into the cave,

09:57.364 --> 09:59.442
you'll see
these nodules of chert

09:59.466 --> 10:01.678
that are seeping
out of the rock, right,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.446
and as you get deeper in,
it gets really humid,

10:03.470 --> 10:05.615
so it makes it soft, so you can
work it between your fingers,

10:05.639 --> 10:08.451
and it don't... it feels like
you're handling honey.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.309
Rocks that turn into honey?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.021
Are you kidding me?
We have to do that.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.289
Right?
Yeah.

10:13.313 --> 10:17.393
Well, I don't think it
actually turns into honey,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.395
and I think you got
to get pretty deep, too.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.130
I don't know.
Well...

10:21.154 --> 10:23.099
I could be messing
it all up my head.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.902
Well, the more you know.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.804
<i>♪ Bam, bam, bam, bam</i>

10:27.828 --> 10:29.829
That's absolutely
not the jingle, but nice try.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.040
(LAUGHS)

10:31.064 --> 10:32.642
Whatever, man.
Whatever.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.877
JOHN: I gotta be
honest, I'm impressed

10:33.901 --> 10:35.444
with your suddenly
random knowledge.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.814
I'm just reciting what I read
right off of the web page.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.949
Oh, take the win, Josh.
Oh, come on, man.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.550
I really love it

10:41.574 --> 10:43.653
when you accidentally
show your awesomeness.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.178
You don't need to clown me.
I'm not clowning you.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.324
I'm not.
You know, I'm only good

10:48.348 --> 10:50.159
at anything
because I get pushed.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.460
Okay?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.096
Like when
I was a high school kid,

10:53.120 --> 10:54.497
and you were just the kid,
you know,

10:54.521 --> 10:56.565
you used to show me up when
you hung with the older guys.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.802
But it made me
look great, you know?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.603
Like remember
that one time at Scout camp,

11:00.627 --> 11:01.938
where I came
with a mascot thing?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.973
Oh, yeah, yeah. Beav.
Yeah, The Beav.

11:03.997 --> 11:04.841
You know, went and carved it

11:04.865 --> 11:06.242
on all the trees
where you were camping.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.911
It looked awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.679
It did, it looked awesome.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.038
You know,
a large chunk of who I am

11:11.138 --> 11:15.251
is because, you know, of you.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.486
And that's a good thing, though.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.148
Hopefully, I return
the favor, even slightly.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.028
Yeah.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.964
Yeah. Let's keep going.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.868
(IMITATING YODA)
Proud of you, I am, Joshwalker.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.270
You can't just let a moment
be a moment, can you, man?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.839
I can't.
(JOSH LAUGHS)

11:35.863 --> 11:38.441
It's getting harder to do, too.
My throat hurts.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.667
Ah, wait up.
All right.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.829
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.347
You might want to conserve
the battery on that thing

26:45.371 --> 26:47.249
as long as you can.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.607
Yeah.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.120
Got it. Okay, yeah.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.446
SUSIE: Okay. Okay.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.585
Shoot.

27:15.001 --> 27:18.413
We've never seen anything
this technical, this tough.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.982
FEMALE REPORTER:
26-year-old John Jones

27:20.006 --> 27:21.984
went to BYU and was in his
second year of med school...

27:22.008 --> 27:23.752
MALE REPORTER: ...loved
the outdoors and explored

27:23.776 --> 27:25.654
caves before...
This one was different.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.823
He's stuck head down,
that would tell me

27:27.847 --> 27:29.457
that he was probably
still on his way in.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.459
MALE REPORTER: The rescuers
had to squeeze through

27:31.483 --> 27:32.995
narrow twisting passageways...

27:33.019 --> 27:35.831
MAN: If we'd put other people
in that same location,

27:35.855 --> 27:38.858
they could likewise
get stuck or get hurt.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.674
Where's Hodgson?
Right there.

27:45.698 --> 27:46.698
Thanks.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.701
And will someone get ahold
of the news station,

27:48.801 --> 27:52.247
and get rid of that chopper?
I can barely hear myself think.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.316
How long you been there?
Not long.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.617
How's our boy doing down there?

27:55.641 --> 27:57.185
He's been trapped
at least three hours.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.586
He's got near zero mobility,

27:58.610 --> 28:00.155
and it's next to impossible
to get a rope on him

28:00.179 --> 28:02.157
anywhere that gives us
any purchase.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.591
Well, how deep is he?

28:03.615 --> 28:05.260
Pretty much all the way down
in one of the unmapped parts.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.996
About 100 feet below ground
through a bunch of tunnels.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.332
HODGSON: I thought they
closed that place off.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.834
SUSIE: They did, it's been
closed to the public,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.536
but it looks like his brother
got a special permit to get in.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.562
Sheriff Hodgson.
Dr. Doug Murdock.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.374
I'm a trauma critical care,
Utah Valley Medical.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.376
How is John doing physically?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.779
It's hard to say.
He's gurgling a lot.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.114
What kind of angle's
his body at?

28:26.138 --> 28:28.483
He's pretty much
all the way down,

28:28.507 --> 28:30.886
maybe a 70-degree angle.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.579
The body...
It can't survive that long.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.457
Blood has to pump backwards,

28:35.481 --> 28:37.893
circulation slows,
capillaries leak.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.962
I mean, things start
to fail pretty quickly.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.396
Well, how long has he got?

28:41.420 --> 28:44.032
Considering how long
he's already been trapped,

28:44.056 --> 28:46.668
he's gonna get delirious
in another two hours.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.872
Six to eight hours from that,
his body starts shutting down.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.975
So once we get him out,
is he going to be okay?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.743
There'll be toxins
built up in his blood.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.544
So if you take him out
on the wrong angle,

28:56.568 --> 28:58.546
that could to through
his heart and kill him.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.750
So the faster we act,
the better his chances.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.442
Let's get our guy
and get him down there.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.754
Who's taking point?
Aaron.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.089
SUSIE: Are you sure
he's ready again?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.224
I mean, he hasn't been
the same since Crandall.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.826
HODGSON: Yeah, none
of us have been.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.594
I know, and he thinks
he should have been in there.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.063
This feels all too similar.
Should we tap someone else?

29:15.087 --> 29:17.332
HODGSON: Aaron's the best
we got, you know that.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.834
Besides that,
he loves that place.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.535
He's been down there
mapping it for years.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.963
That place is unique.
It's got to be Aaron.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.882
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm headin' down.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.451
What's the guy's name?
John Jones.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.053
Okay.
How are you feeling?

29:38.077 --> 29:40.688
Good.
Are you sure?

29:40.712 --> 29:42.891
Yeah. See you down there.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.860
Hey, Aaron, you know
this could be a while.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.594
It doesn't look like you're
taking a lot with you.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.596
You've been in this cave, Susie.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.265
You know she doesn't like
to be stuffed.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.200
HODGSON: Whatever you think, Aaron.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.468
Look, Susie gave us an idea

29:53.492 --> 29:55.270
of what we we're
working with down there.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.805
So I need you to get to him,

29:56.829 --> 29:58.473
find a way to get him free,

29:58.497 --> 29:59.808
and when the time comes,
we're going to have

29:59.832 --> 30:01.633
to get real creative
on this one.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.238
I'm not coming out without him.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.616
(MUSIC PLAYING)

30:28.294 --> 30:29.962
Hi, beautiful.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.032
Nice to see you again.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.104
John Jones.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.535
Whoa.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.005
This is new.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.897
Okay.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.848
John!

31:28.554 --> 31:29.888
John?

31:32.824 --> 31:34.093
Hey.

31:35.761 --> 31:36.929
Hey.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.373
I'm Aaron.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.475
How are you feeling, buddy?

31:40.499 --> 31:41.709
Can you get me out of here?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.578
I'm kind of done
with being on my head.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.382
The question is, what are
you doing on your head?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.918
I wish it was a longer
and more interesting story.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.244
AARON: I bet you do.
I bet you do.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.191
Real story, it's gonna be
the one about

31:56.215 --> 31:57.926
how we got you out of here.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.284
(SCOFFS)

31:59.285 --> 32:02.230
SUSIE: John's body is too
big to just be pulled out.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.167
He's so deep, it's hard
to get any leverage.

32:05.191 --> 32:08.003
It looks like when he went in,
he sucked in air

32:08.027 --> 32:09.104
to squeeze in
where he's trapped.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.905
So if we're
going to get him out,

32:10.929 --> 32:13.108
he's going to have to do it
again and push while we pull.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.410
But there's a problem,
the tunnel bends

32:15.434 --> 32:16.945
right against his back.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.304
Meaning what?

32:18.404 --> 32:21.040
Meaning we'll probably have to
break his legs to get him out.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.787
JOHN: That bad, huh?

32:25.811 --> 32:27.722
AARON: Eh, I've been a part of

32:27.746 --> 32:31.359
a lot of search and rescues
that seem near impossible.

32:31.383 --> 32:35.030
We'll figure this out, man,
no doubt in my mind.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.565
JOHN: Okay.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.758
Here, you don't
need this right now.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.065
You're probably thirsty.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.937
Here.
Drink coming down.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.661
Got it. Thank you.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.130
Is that lemon?

33:08.154 --> 33:10.132
I always wondered
who bought that awful flavor,

33:10.156 --> 33:11.966
and now I know it's
you search and rescue guys.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.336
Hey, I didn't buy it, all right?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.138
I get what you mean, though.
It's disgusting.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.140
It takes like
dish soap or something.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.907
But, hey,
when we get on the surface,

33:19.931 --> 33:21.976
you get me a bigger budget,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.579
I'll come get the other guys
with, I don't know,

33:24.603 --> 33:26.348
blue, purple,
whatever they want.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.515
(AARON LAUGHS)

33:27.539 --> 33:29.708
Yeah. You know, actually,

33:29.808 --> 33:32.820
my legs feel looser,
I think I can... try and...

33:32.844 --> 33:34.656
(JOHN GRUNTS AND STRUGGLES)

33:34.680 --> 33:37.359
AARON: Whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey!

33:37.383 --> 33:40.852
(MUSIC PLAYING)

33:54.233 --> 33:56.902
No! No! No!

33:57.002 --> 33:58.480
AARON: Don't move. It's just me.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.382
Okay, stop. Stop.

34:00.406 --> 34:03.175
(COUGHING)

34:04.410 --> 34:06.178
It's just me.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.819
What's up, man?

34:16.255 --> 34:19.000
It's nice to see a face.

34:19.024 --> 34:22.737
Listen, we're going
to get you out of here, okay?

34:22.761 --> 34:25.540
Well, sorry about that.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.574
I kicked dirt
all over the place.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.934
AARON: It's okay.

34:29.034 --> 34:32.347
Cleanliness is impossible
in a wild beauty like this one.

34:32.371 --> 34:36.150
Besides, it's crazy with walls
getting soft and hard.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.221
It's like this cave
is alive sometimes.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.855
Yeah.

34:40.879 --> 34:45.117
Don't try it upside down,
you'll start seeing things.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.121
You seeing ghosts?

34:51.623 --> 34:53.958
I don't know.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.763
Hey, relax.

34:59.465 --> 35:00.532
(JOHN GRUNTS)

35:04.035 --> 35:07.449
And, uh, that's what
you call it, right?

35:07.473 --> 35:08.750
This is doing the same thing

35:08.774 --> 35:11.052
and expecting
a different result.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.955
It's the definition
of insanity, right?

35:13.979 --> 35:16.948
Einstein I think, huh?
Brilliant.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.862
Being stuck in here

35:20.886 --> 35:23.097
has nothing to do
with my waistline, does it?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.089
(CHUCKLES)

35:26.091 --> 35:29.437
Well, I wasn't going to say
anything, but, uh...

35:29.461 --> 35:30.805
(AARON LAUGHS)

35:30.829 --> 35:32.474
Did you just call me fat?

35:32.498 --> 35:34.309
AARON: Oh...

35:34.333 --> 35:36.334
It is what it is.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.837
Once we get up there, if you
need a workout buddy, I'm game.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.506
You promise?

35:43.074 --> 35:44.752
Promise.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.288
MAN: (ON TV)
We were able to send

35:46.312 --> 35:48.423
one of our cavers in
close enough to him

35:48.447 --> 35:49.491
that they were able to chat.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.259
FEMALE REPORTER:
The Nutty Putty Cave is in

35:51.283 --> 35:53.661
an extremely narrow offshoot
known as The Birth Canal.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.853
MALE REPORTER: His body
plugged in a narrow tunnel,

35:55.854 --> 35:57.499
10-14 inches wide.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.167
MALE OFFICER: Anytime
you're in a position where

35:59.191 --> 36:01.859
you don't have control
over when you come and go,

36:01.860 --> 36:03.638
it's gonna have an effect
the person emotionally.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.139
MAN: There's still some more
tight spots in the cave.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.008
Gravity was
really working against him,

36:07.032 --> 36:08.267
and he didn't have any leverage.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.282
SUSIE: All right, give it a tug.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.017
(SUSIE GRUNTS)

36:16.041 --> 36:17.619
SUSIE: It's as humid
as hell down there.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.921
The moisture's constantly working
on the outer layer of rock.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.456
It makes it both slick and soft.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.525
If we can't get
those anchors in far enough,

36:23.549 --> 36:24.659
we've got a real problem.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.429
We haven't tried cutting
the rock free from around him.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.130
And there's other options.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.598
Like what,
take out the peanut oil?

36:30.622 --> 36:31.999
What, guys?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.135
Another rescue agency ordered
four gallons of peanut oil,

36:34.159 --> 36:36.538
hope that they could pour it
on him and he'd just slip free.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.105
It's either that or drilling.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.974
The time it'll take to get
the equipment down there,

36:39.998 --> 36:41.209
it's going to take
five times as long

36:41.233 --> 36:42.710
to set up a good pulley system.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.145
We don't have that kind of time.

36:44.169 --> 36:46.381
Sheriff, it's your call.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.506
Okay.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.477
(MUSIC PLAYING)

37:37.222 --> 37:38.189
No!

37:39.090 --> 37:41.503
No! Stay away from her!

37:41.527 --> 37:43.938
No, stay away from her!

37:43.962 --> 37:46.131
(JOHN JERKING VIOLENTLY)

37:48.066 --> 37:50.778
Calm down, John.
Get away from her!

37:50.802 --> 37:53.548
Calm down, John.
Hey! Hey, it's okay.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.951
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Just, just let it pass.

37:56.975 --> 38:00.412
Okay, just feel it,
and let it pass, okay?

38:02.581 --> 38:05.451
(JOHN COUGHING)

38:13.825 --> 38:15.594
AARON: It's gonna be all right.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.877
Look...

38:22.901 --> 38:25.780
I'm not leaving here
without you.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.550
Okay, but when the time comes,

38:28.574 --> 38:33.488
I need every ounce of energy
you've got to help me push.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.824
Can you be with me on that?
(JOHN COUGHS)

38:36.848 --> 38:38.016
Yeah.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.998
Man, your job really sucks.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.233
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

38:46.257 --> 38:49.303
You know, I thought that
about everyone else's job.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.673
I get to visit cool places
and help people,

38:51.697 --> 38:58.413
but, granted, right now,
yeah, this really sucks.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.105
Yeah.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.451
So what's
your track record, anyway?

39:03.475 --> 39:07.021
Like, how many
have you tried to free

39:07.045 --> 39:09.548
and how many
actually made it out?

39:10.882 --> 39:12.494
Like a percentage?

39:12.518 --> 39:14.386
How many?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.867
Well, we all go for 100%.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.827
It just doesn't
always go that way.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.678
JOHN: You know, uh,

39:30.702 --> 39:34.782
I could actually go for
some more Gatorade right now.

39:34.806 --> 39:35.983
(CHUCKLES)

39:36.007 --> 39:39.120
You sure it's not gonna
make matters worse?

39:39.144 --> 39:41.889
That stuff really
isn't that bad anymore.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.726
AARON: All right.
Hold on. Just a second.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.694
All right.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.219
Comin' down.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.394
Thank you.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.831
AARON: You got it?

40:17.449 --> 40:18.617
Got it.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.701
Yeah, that stuff
really isn't that bad.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.528
I used to think
it tasted like dish soap, but...

40:31.396 --> 40:33.198
JOHN: It's becoming my favorite.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.267
AARON: That's a good sign.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.082
Hey.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.885
Hey, Aaron.
Yeah?

40:43.909 --> 40:46.120
How are you doing?

40:46.144 --> 40:48.189
I'm great, man.
You good?

40:48.213 --> 40:50.248
AARON: Hey, don't worry
about me, okay?

40:51.382 --> 40:52.960
You just focus on breathing.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.796
You just breathe.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.655
Very slow. Slow and easy.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.428
(AARON GRUNTS, EXHALES)

41:09.467 --> 41:12.747
Well, we've got
a little bit of time here.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.816
Why don't you tell me
about yourself, John.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.450
Where are you from?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.986
Oh, and, uh, make sure
you take a deep breath

41:19.010 --> 41:20.588
before you start talking.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.791
I want you to breathe
slow and easy for now.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.350
Slow and easy.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.288
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41:49.007 --> 41:50.852
JOHN: I've had a
pretty normal life.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.354
Kind of boring
when it all comes down to it.

41:53.378 --> 41:56.090
I'm just your average guy.
YOUNG JOSH: Give it back!

41:56.114 --> 41:58.092
AARON: Oh, come on, John, heh,

41:58.116 --> 41:59.426
there's no such thing
as average.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.995
Everybody's got a story.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.497
YOUNG JOSH: You're so mean.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.332
JOHN: I'm from St. George.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.935
I have four brothers
and two sisters.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.537
With my little brother Josh,

42:09.561 --> 42:11.172
I just did what
any older brother does.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.541
That's mine!
You can't take it!

42:13.565 --> 42:14.542
What, this?

42:14.566 --> 42:16.177
Make life as miserable
as possible.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.402
Is that all you got?

42:23.709 --> 42:26.320
You're supposed to be
an example to your brothers.

42:26.344 --> 42:29.356
Take care of them,
teach them stuff.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.792
But I had this idea
that it was my job

42:30.816 --> 42:32.393
to help
toughen them up, you know?

42:32.417 --> 42:34.986
Maybe I had a little
too much fun doing that part.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.834
I still can't figure out
how my mom and dad did it.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.368
It was nuts.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.337
I look at it now and it's not
"How did you do it,"

42:43.361 --> 42:45.907
but more,
"Show me how you did it."

42:45.931 --> 42:47.208
They're amazing.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.844
And, man, we broke everything.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.603
(MUSIC PLAYING)

42:55.373 --> 42:58.185
You know what's funny?
We would fight and tease.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.187
But we were always there
for each other.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.856
Josh is the closest to my age,

43:01.880 --> 43:03.825
so naturally,
we did the most together,

43:03.849 --> 43:06.527
for better or worse.

43:06.551 --> 43:08.262
I'm probably
the most competitive

43:08.286 --> 43:09.764
and crazy one in the family.

43:09.788 --> 43:11.999
I played basketball
and football in high school.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.334
And thanks to my family,

43:13.358 --> 43:15.837
I had the largest
fan group of them all.

43:15.861 --> 43:17.696
(MUSIC PLAYING)

43:39.985 --> 43:41.319
Hi.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.514
What the...

44:17.322 --> 44:18.857
Who are you?

44:22.127 --> 44:23.337
JOHN: Who are you?

44:23.361 --> 44:24.696
YOUNG JOSH: Give it back!

44:24.796 --> 44:26.273
(JOHN JERKING VIOLENTLY)
AARON: I need you to listen!

44:26.297 --> 44:27.809
Come on, hey, hey!

44:27.833 --> 44:29.076
Nothing's changed.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.578
Hey, it's just me and you.

44:31.602 --> 44:33.671
AARON: It's just me and you.
It's okay.

44:39.644 --> 44:41.022
Gosh, I'm so tired of that.

44:41.046 --> 44:43.882
(DRILL WHIRRING IN DISTANCE)

44:43.982 --> 44:46.027
What's that sound?

44:46.051 --> 44:48.129
It's just the drills.

44:48.153 --> 44:50.965
They got
the first two into position.

44:50.989 --> 44:53.134
AARON: Let's get you
more to drink, okay?

44:53.158 --> 44:54.368
JOHN: Okay.

44:54.392 --> 44:55.560
Comin' down.

44:57.328 --> 44:58.563
Okay.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.904
(CHUCKLES)
Go easy, dude.

45:07.839 --> 45:08.907
(EFFORTING EXHALE)

45:11.142 --> 45:13.144
That's actually pretty good now.

45:16.481 --> 45:20.694
Try to cast
the cable back right.

45:20.718 --> 45:24.899
Seeing one of those takes me
back into my mission.

45:24.923 --> 45:27.401
I think that's
the first time I used one.

45:27.425 --> 45:31.072
Mission, huh?
Where'd you go?

45:31.096 --> 45:34.499
Ecuador.
How about you?

45:35.767 --> 45:37.879
Look at you assuming things.

45:37.903 --> 45:40.105
You know,
not everyone in Utah is Mormon.

45:44.009 --> 45:45.586
That's my bad, man.

45:45.610 --> 45:47.654
You got to ask though, right?

45:47.678 --> 45:49.614
There's just tons out here.

45:51.082 --> 45:54.428
I live in Virginia,
where, I'm just saying,

45:54.452 --> 45:56.121
a mission would throw
most people off.

45:56.221 --> 45:57.398
(EXHALES)

45:57.422 --> 45:59.690
Yeah, you can't
really assume anymore.

46:04.562 --> 46:07.198
Vegas. Spanish speaking.

46:10.135 --> 46:11.913
Thanks, man.

46:11.937 --> 46:14.681
I thought I killed
the conversation, man.

46:14.705 --> 46:17.785
Nobody wants
to be that guy, you know?

46:17.809 --> 46:19.787
So you had
to suffer through Spanish?

46:19.811 --> 46:22.790
Oh, yeah, it was pretty rough.

46:22.814 --> 46:26.984
No. No, it just sucked.
Yeah, it sucked.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.295
Do you still speak it?

46:28.319 --> 46:30.764
When I can.
I sound terrible, though.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.400
Did you ever, like,
dream in Spanish?

46:33.424 --> 46:34.592
Yeah.

46:37.795 --> 46:43.077
It's funny, I spent
so much time out there

46:43.101 --> 46:45.379
talking about life and death

46:45.403 --> 46:48.615
with anybody who'll listen.
(DISTANT DRILLING CONTINUES)

46:48.639 --> 46:51.118
Try to teach about something

46:51.142 --> 46:53.387
we may not truly understand

46:53.411 --> 46:54.679
until we die.

46:57.015 --> 46:58.993
And now...

46:59.017 --> 47:01.662
Boom, here I am.

47:01.686 --> 47:03.797
John?
I'm pretty sure I literally

47:03.821 --> 47:05.833
have been staring
death in the face.

47:05.857 --> 47:07.668
Hey, John,

47:07.692 --> 47:09.860
promise me you won't
talk like that again.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.505
It's just...

47:11.529 --> 47:13.131
We just don't need
to talk about it.

47:15.533 --> 47:17.367
I'm pretty sure you get
to talk life and death

47:17.368 --> 47:20.247
with people like me
all the time, right?

47:20.271 --> 47:21.315
(SIGHS)

47:21.339 --> 47:23.584
Well, I try to avoid it.

47:23.608 --> 47:24.986
To be honest with you, man,

47:25.010 --> 47:27.688
I haven't really been into
the church thing for a while.

47:27.712 --> 47:30.048
Really, any kind of church.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.993
Just wasn't your thing or...?

47:32.017 --> 47:33.027
I don't know.

47:33.051 --> 47:36.430
I'm just living my life
a day at a time,

47:36.454 --> 47:39.800
just trying to do my job right,
help people.

47:39.824 --> 47:42.203
They can learn about
all that life and death stuff

47:42.227 --> 47:45.062
when they're on the surface,
when we're not involved.

47:45.063 --> 47:47.298
So helping people...

47:49.334 --> 47:50.711
Look at that.

47:50.735 --> 47:52.903
You believe in something, right?

47:52.904 --> 47:54.906
Yeah, sure.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.026
I thought you were gonna start
preaching to me.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.394
(CHUCKLES)

48:07.418 --> 48:11.398
No. To each their own.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.634
It's fun to hear
other people's thoughts

48:13.658 --> 48:15.536
on this stuff, though.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.904
It probably sounds lame to most,

48:16.928 --> 48:20.999
but to be honest,
it makes me feel at peace.

48:23.368 --> 48:24.711
Yeah, that's the reason

48:24.735 --> 48:27.514
why we do all this
church stuff anyway, right?

48:27.538 --> 48:30.017
To feel good?
I guess so.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.586
It'd probably be good if more
people treated it like that.

48:32.610 --> 48:35.356
You know, as long as you find

48:35.380 --> 48:36.657
what makes you happy.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.759
Yeah? I mean, that's kind of
the endless search

48:38.783 --> 48:41.395
for everyone, it seems,
and every time...

48:41.419 --> 48:43.430
(LAUGHS)
Wow!

48:43.454 --> 48:44.789
(JOHN CHUCKLES)

48:47.125 --> 48:49.793
AARON: Look at you
sneaking that in on me.

48:49.794 --> 48:52.573
Man, you want me
to save you first,

48:52.597 --> 48:56.277
and then you can do
your rescue on me.

48:56.301 --> 48:59.637
No, I'm just conversing, is all.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.084
That was obviously...

49:03.108 --> 49:06.411
They were suggestions,
so I'll be sticking you to it.

49:08.046 --> 49:08.956
(GROANS)

49:08.980 --> 49:10.982
You're something else, dude.

(DRILL RATTLING)

49:15.620 --> 49:17.464

49:17.488 --> 49:18.990
Come on!

49:19.957 --> 49:22.636
(DRILL WHIRRING IN DISTANCE)

49:22.660 --> 49:24.329
That sounds like
it's going well.

49:25.763 --> 49:28.142
Yeah, it better be.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.044
So what brought you
down here anyways?

49:30.068 --> 49:34.648
I mean, I'd assume
you're pretty used to caving.

49:34.672 --> 49:36.006
What tipped you off?

49:36.007 --> 49:38.719
Well, you're sporting some
fantastic vintage headlamps.

49:38.743 --> 49:41.079
Besides, most people are
too afraid to get down this far.

49:43.281 --> 49:45.983
I guess I could never
turn down an adventure.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.497
That's probably
how I ended up in Virginia.

49:50.521 --> 49:52.857
Really? What's in Virginia?

49:54.425 --> 49:57.604
I'm going to school to be
a pediatric cardiologist.

49:57.628 --> 50:01.908
Oh, so you're working with kids?

50:01.932 --> 50:03.844
Yeah.

50:03.868 --> 50:06.313
Well, at least their hearts.
Phew.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.581
What made you want to do that?

50:07.605 --> 50:09.650
Isn't that
like 50 years of school?

50:09.674 --> 50:10.975
JOHN: Give or take.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.213
My...

50:19.317 --> 50:21.195
My sister, uh,

50:21.219 --> 50:24.431
my younger sister had
heart surgery when she was four.

50:24.455 --> 50:27.058
And I wanted to...

50:30.528 --> 50:32.029
You know, it's sad.

50:37.001 --> 50:40.847
You have to be on the edge
of losing everything

50:40.871 --> 50:42.316
to really open your eyes

50:42.340 --> 50:46.177
and... see the beauty
in the simple things.

50:48.246 --> 50:53.583
Hey, I thought we weren't
gonna talk like that, John?

50:53.584 --> 50:56.587
I've been studying
to be a doctor

50:56.687 --> 50:59.533
the past few years, and...

50:59.557 --> 51:01.902
I can hear
my own breathing, man.

51:01.926 --> 51:04.905
Yeah, I can't sugarcoat
things for you.

51:04.929 --> 51:06.340
Obviously, John,
I know this is bad,

51:06.364 --> 51:09.234
but you're gonna get
out of here, you have to.

51:11.902 --> 51:14.505
I wish I could believe
any fib you could give me.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.919
I don't want to die down here.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.570
I told you
I can hear my breathing.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.273
JOHN: Please, just stop.

51:39.297 --> 51:40.274
John, look at me.

51:40.298 --> 51:42.276
Why didn't I spend
more time with my wife?

51:42.300 --> 51:45.279
No, hey, John, look at me.
Listen, look at me!

51:45.303 --> 51:47.305
Eyes on me, right here.

52:03.654 --> 52:05.323
I believe you.

52:13.798 --> 52:16.934
(MUSIC PLAYING)

52:20.671 --> 52:22.449
Such a John thing to do.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.818
Always pushing himself
just a little too hard.

52:24.842 --> 52:27.821
Well, that's why he's so strong.

52:27.845 --> 52:30.657
And that's what's going
to get him through this.

52:30.681 --> 52:34.851
He's gotten himself into some
crazy situations before, right?

52:34.852 --> 52:37.188
Rock climbing, scuba diving.

52:37.288 --> 52:38.899
Getting married?

52:38.923 --> 52:41.001
Yeah, that's one
he's not getting out of.

52:41.025 --> 52:43.504
I don't care how deep
of a hole he crawls down.

52:43.528 --> 52:45.105
Yeah.

52:45.129 --> 52:47.140
The guy on phone told me
there's already

52:47.164 --> 52:49.676
a bunch of people there
working to get him out.

52:49.700 --> 52:52.846
And as soon as I hung up,
I knew it was gonna be okay.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.871
And I still know it.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.207
They're getting him out.

52:56.307 --> 52:58.519
Look, Em,
I've just been down there,

52:58.543 --> 53:00.187
and I know how it is.

53:00.211 --> 53:01.955
And I don't want
to take away hope.

53:01.979 --> 53:03.857
He will, Josh, he will get out.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.851
How do you know?
Because...

53:10.621 --> 53:12.156
Because he has to.

53:14.392 --> 53:17.394
AARON: All right, you're
obviously a stud.

53:17.395 --> 53:19.540
You're in med school,

53:19.564 --> 53:21.007
which takes serious foresight

53:21.031 --> 53:23.644
to make it work,
let's be honest.

53:23.668 --> 53:26.179
I bet that wife of yours

53:26.203 --> 53:28.215
feels pretty lucky
that she snagged you, huh?

53:28.239 --> 53:31.885
Uh-uh.
You got it backwards.

53:31.909 --> 53:34.321
I had to win her over.

53:34.345 --> 53:35.622
Yeah.

53:35.646 --> 53:37.824
She made me fight for it.

53:37.848 --> 53:40.351
Really?
Like a fight, huh?

53:41.586 --> 53:42.863
Yeah.

53:42.887 --> 53:44.965
I'd have preferred a fist fight.

53:44.989 --> 53:48.402
It would have been less painful.

53:48.426 --> 53:50.495
Easier on my heart. Heh.

53:54.432 --> 53:56.310
Well...
Wait, wait, wait, you're going

53:56.334 --> 53:58.144
to leave me hanging right there?

53:58.168 --> 54:00.247
Come on.

54:00.271 --> 54:01.715
You've got to tell me
about this girl

54:01.739 --> 54:04.885
that completely owned you.

54:04.909 --> 54:08.946
Oh, she is, uh...
She's everything.

54:11.916 --> 54:15.061
It's one thing to find a girl

54:15.085 --> 54:18.899
that who you want to marry.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.535
And it's something
completely different

54:21.559 --> 54:24.362
to find a girl
that you have to marry.

54:25.530 --> 54:27.698
(JOHN COUGHING)

54:29.467 --> 54:31.268
Damn.

54:49.086 --> 54:51.932
(CAR HONKS, TIRES SCREECHING)
EMILY: Hey!

54:51.956 --> 54:53.157
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

54:57.328 --> 54:59.606
This is the first time
I met you.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.065
At a crosswalk.

55:01.899 --> 55:03.143
I'm sorry?

55:03.167 --> 55:04.778
We realized we were going
to same class together.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.547
You're in O. Chem, too?

55:06.571 --> 55:08.649
You must be
a glutton for punishment.

55:08.673 --> 55:10.140
I'm John.

55:11.342 --> 55:12.443
Emily.

55:13.511 --> 55:14.821
Emily.

55:14.845 --> 55:16.847
JOHN: I immediately wished I
had something more to say

55:16.947 --> 55:20.627
but my mind drew
a complete blank.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.496
You were just so beautiful.

55:22.520 --> 55:23.521
See ya.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.670
(LIGHT CHATTERING)

55:53.884 --> 55:55.529
Hey, guys, I'm taking off.

55:55.553 --> 55:56.797
Where are you going?

55:56.821 --> 55:58.499
Home.

55:58.523 --> 56:01.201
Wow, Mr. "Let's pull an
all nighter" is leaving early.

56:01.225 --> 56:03.937
A little distracted. I'm sorry.

56:03.961 --> 56:05.796
See you at class.

56:07.898 --> 56:10.401
(MUSIC PLAYING)

56:15.673 --> 56:16.841
Oh!

56:19.176 --> 56:21.221
I am so sorry.

56:21.245 --> 56:22.689
Here, let me get those.

56:22.713 --> 56:26.893
Is this like a normal thing
for you, running into things?

56:26.917 --> 56:28.695
No, destiny did this.

56:28.719 --> 56:31.498
I swear, I'm usually like
really... I'm nimble.

56:31.522 --> 56:34.801
Yeah, for you, destiny's
kind of a jerk, if you ask me.

56:34.825 --> 56:39.372
Taking away your grace,
throwing you at cars, at me.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.074
Yeah, you've got a serious issue

56:41.098 --> 56:42.576
with that destiny guy,
too, I guess.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.344
Taking away my nimble,

56:44.368 --> 56:47.548
my ability to be nim...
And words.

56:47.572 --> 56:51.518
I'm a funny person, I swear
I am, but funny John was gone.

56:51.542 --> 56:53.554
But I was determined
to make her laugh.

56:53.578 --> 56:57.023
Make the girl smile,
and you got a chance, right?

56:57.047 --> 56:58.925
This is cool.

56:58.949 --> 57:00.594
Orange, that's...

57:00.618 --> 57:04.097
You in kindergarten,
or something?

57:04.121 --> 57:07.123
Yeah, I had no game whatsoever.

57:07.124 --> 57:08.435
And then finally...

57:08.459 --> 57:12.272
Wait, we're going fishing

57:12.296 --> 57:13.607
at midnight
at the Provo Golf Course,

57:13.631 --> 57:16.242
and you should... You'll love it,
you should totally come.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.612
I had no idea
where that came from.

57:18.636 --> 57:21.639
We weren't going fishing.
I didn't even know who we was.

57:21.739 --> 57:24.618
I'm 90% sure there's
no fish in any of the ponds

57:24.642 --> 57:26.587
that we'd have
to trespass to get to.

57:26.611 --> 57:27.754
Really?

57:27.778 --> 57:29.790
Unfortunately, yeah.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.782
I'm so in.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.463
What?

57:36.487 --> 57:39.365
I pooled together the fastest
fake tradition ever.

57:39.389 --> 57:42.402
EMILY: This is crazy.
You guys do this all the time?

57:42.426 --> 57:44.571
Yeah, what else are you gonna do

57:44.595 --> 57:46.039
in the middle
of the night in Provo?

57:46.063 --> 57:48.942
Actually, I kind of take you
as a bookworm.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.376
I'm pretty sure I've seen you

57:50.400 --> 57:52.779
somewhere in that library
every time I go.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.314
Wait, you've seen me before?

57:54.338 --> 57:56.650
Yeah, you're always there.
It's not like I could miss you.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.719
What was with this whole
destiny stuff then?

57:58.743 --> 58:00.320
This whole time
you were tailing me.

58:00.344 --> 58:03.289
Okay, destiny, first off,
that's your word,

58:03.313 --> 58:06.326
and second, destiny for you
was a well-timed hit

58:06.350 --> 58:08.328
that nearly ruined
my research paper.

58:08.352 --> 58:10.396
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

58:10.420 --> 58:13.166
Anyways, now here we go.

58:13.190 --> 58:15.936
It is dark outside,
so be careful when you cast.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.303
Okay.
Because...

58:17.327 --> 58:18.772
...you may hook somebody.

58:18.796 --> 58:19.806
All right, got it.

58:19.830 --> 58:23.577
So cast her and the hook
in the water, right?

58:23.601 --> 58:26.179
Yeah. You've never
fished before, have you?

58:26.203 --> 58:29.449
No. Ha ha, but I've seen it
in the movies, so...

58:29.473 --> 58:30.817
Yeah, that's good enough.
Okay.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.819
That's absolutely fine, so...
All right.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.522
Geez. Calm down, stop, stop!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

58:35.546 --> 58:36.690
Stop.
I'm so sorry.

58:36.714 --> 58:38.158
Okay, I think you're hooked
to the ground.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.593
You guys good back there?
MAN: We're good.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.127
JOHN: Okay.
EMILY: All right.

58:41.151 --> 58:42.362
JOHN: All right, let
me slowly breathe.

58:42.386 --> 58:45.054
Okay, I'm sorry.
Don't say sorry to me.

58:45.055 --> 58:46.700
I mean, you already
said sorry to them.

58:46.724 --> 58:50.336
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.772
I'm... I just...

58:51.796 --> 58:55.175
I don't like not knowing how to
do things, and this is just...

58:55.199 --> 58:57.377
"I don't not like not knowing
how to do things"?

58:57.401 --> 58:58.735
That's a fantastic
double negative.

58:58.736 --> 59:00.905
Yeah, uh...
So, you're good at that.

59:01.005 --> 59:02.549
Can you just show me

59:02.573 --> 59:05.185
how to do this,
so I don't go nuts

59:05.209 --> 59:07.888
or hook somebody,
or I don't know?

59:07.912 --> 59:09.723
Well, yeah, I can.

59:09.747 --> 59:11.725
We really got to focus
on your technique,

59:11.749 --> 59:13.493
so I probably should...

59:13.517 --> 59:15.328
Yeah, you can do that.

59:15.352 --> 59:17.397
JOHN: My game was so on.

59:17.421 --> 59:19.700
I couldn't get a good word
out of my mouth in the morning,

59:19.724 --> 59:22.636
but had her
in my arms that night.

59:22.660 --> 59:25.205
Two, three...

59:25.229 --> 59:26.640
JOHN: Let go.
EMILY: I did it!

59:26.664 --> 59:28.074
You did it!
(EMILY HAPPILY SCREAMS)

59:28.098 --> 59:29.475
I did it! I can fish!

59:29.499 --> 59:31.411
I can fish!
You can fish.

59:31.435 --> 59:33.479
Usually, you need a fish
to prove that, but you don't.

59:33.503 --> 59:34.848
She figured out how to fish,

59:34.872 --> 59:37.250
and we went fishing
so many times.

59:37.274 --> 59:38.518
I mean, she never caught a thing

59:38.542 --> 59:40.353
but it was never about the fish.

59:40.377 --> 59:41.421
Absolutely.
Nothing to do with you.

59:41.445 --> 59:42.989
JOHN: Nothing to do
with me. Nothing.

59:43.013 --> 59:45.249
(MUSIC PLAYING)

59:52.957 --> 59:54.458
And that was that.

59:54.558 --> 59:58.338
It seemed like Emily and I
just suddenly happened.

59:58.362 --> 01:00:00.506
Two weeks dating
and we were inseparable.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.677
It was like one of those movies
where everything just works.

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.746
The day didn't feel right
if she wasn't with me.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.972
We just did everything together.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.459
But those movies
where everything just works,

01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:20.961
they don't exist.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:24.464
Something always happens.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.199
EMILY: It's just for
a little while.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.301
It's four months,
the entire semester.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:29.636
Okay, think of it this way,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.137
you can get back
to living in the library,

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.374
and when I get back, my Spanish
will be almost as good as yours.

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:35.408
It'll be better.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:36.542
None of that worked.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.278
Her Spanish was awful

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.313
and I went insane
waiting by the computer.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:41.815
Okay?

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:42.973
Bye.

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:45.409
EMILY: See you.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.649
Actually,
I did go a little insane.

(JOHN SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.068
I finally had
a chance to sing a song

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:05.238
that I've been writing for her
while she was in Spain.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.107
In that setting,

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.508
under those lights,

01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:11.035
Emily looked incredible.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:15.281
There was no going back.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:19.285
I knew I had to ask,
I had to try.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:21.755
It had felt right
to ask that day,

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.882
and I just had
to go through with it.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:30.130
What in the world are you doing?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.032
I apologize for my voice.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.366
I was shaking the entire time.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.392
It's fine. You're perfect.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:41.274
I love you, Ems.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.977
I love you.
Marry me, Ems.

a little bit longer? I mean...

I know and I get it, okay?

01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:50.984
Good heavens, we're young.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.685
You know, and I know
it's hard to step in

on so many things
that you want to do,

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.027
What changed?

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.532
I just feel that
if I let you go again,

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.634
then I won't get another
chance to marry you.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:11.071
Now, wait a minute, I mean,
if it's not going to work

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:12.572
in a year or 18 months from now,

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:14.474
how would rushing it
right now be right?

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:15.742
JOHN: No, it's not like that.

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:18.268
I swear, whatever you say now,
I'm with you, okay?

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:19.679
I'm behind you 100%.

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:23.540
If you think we should wait,
then... I'll wait.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:27.888
But... I just got to ask.

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:30.156
I never had
a feeling this strong.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:35.119
So, Ems, will you marry me?

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.234
I'm sorry.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:42.893
I just can't.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:53.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
She said no?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.448
Yeah.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:57.306
Well, technically,

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.953
she didn't really
say anything, I guess.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.454
What?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.689
And you wrote that song for her,

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.192
and the event over the city,

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.861
and it was just nothing?

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.796
Yeah.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.432
I don't really have
a good voice, though.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.935
No...

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:16.903
It only makes sense,

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:20.273
you gotta fight
for a girl like that.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.566
Fight is right, man. Geez.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.104
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:47.067
MALE REPORTER:
Since Tuesday night,

01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:48.334
rescuers struggled against

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:51.637
the unforgiving topography
of Nutty Putty Cave...

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.673
One of the most
popular caves in Utah,

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.108
but its narrow passages have

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:57.077
also made it
one of the most dangerous...

01:03:57.101 --> 01:03:58.845
Where he is trapped
is on a bend,

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:00.981
so there's no way
to really get a hold on him

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.815
to be able to pull him
directly straight back.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.684
MALE REPORTER:
There's a small lip of rock

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:05.751
at a critical bend...

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.020
If you pulled against it,

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.812
you're pulling
like against a fish hook.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.329
HODGSON: Good work, Bryce.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.098
Jason, how you holding up?

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:20.600
Look, guys, we're going
on 20 hours straight here.

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.802
So if anyone's
losing their edge,

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:24.871
there's no shame
in admitting it.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.840
Nobody's resting
till John's out of there.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:31.811
All right, then, let's get
back at it. Let's go.

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:35.906
Authorized personnel!
Hey, authorized personnel only.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.679
JOSH: How is it
looking, Sheriff?

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.891
We're getting close.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.227
Look, I appreciate you
wantin' to be here. It's a zoo.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:49.062
The best thing you can do
to help your brother

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.163
is just lay back.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:52.532
Uh, I understand.
I'll get out of your way.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:55.135
But Emily needs to stay.
Who's Emily?

01:04:55.159 --> 01:04:57.570
She's the one
you're saving John for.

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.096
Listen, we know
you're working hard,

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:02.742
and we really
don't want to be in your way,

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:04.768
but she's been waiting
for hours.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.353
Emily, nice to meet you.
I'm Tom.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:14.687
Thank you so much

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.156
for everything
that you guys are doing.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.115
I know you're all
working really hard.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:21.094
How is he doing?
Is he doing okay?

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:23.863
We got someone down there
with him at all times.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:25.999
You know, I know
I can't do anything to help.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.767
I just want
to be there, that's all.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.458
I just want to be there

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:31.271
when he gets out,
I just want to see him.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:32.772
How long can he last down there?

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:35.108
I mean, he's been
down there a long time.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.742
HODGSON: I'd be lying
if I didn't tell you

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.544
the strain on his body
is enormous.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.413
It'd sure do him good
to hear your voice.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.682
You could do that?

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:45.075
Steve, let him know she's here.

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:47.211
JOHN: Emily?

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:53.126
Hey, deep breaths.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.461
Where is she?
When can I talk to her?

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.630
Radio's not gonna
get through the rock.

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:58.864
They're gonna spool down a line,

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:01.734
rig up a comm system
for you, okay?

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.103
Just a minute.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:05.705
Can you...
Can you tell her I'm sorry?

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:08.774
I shouldn't have come down here.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.443
I'm so sorry
to put her through this.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.812
You can tell all that
through yourself, all right?

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:15.172
It's just a few
more minutes, that's it.

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:17.074

I hate this cave.

It's okay.

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:46.179
AARON: I need you to focus
on your breathing, okay?

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:47.680
That'll help. I know
that sounds weird.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:48.914
Just focus on it.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.284
In and out, it'll help.
She's here.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:52.676
Just few more minutes.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.280
I'm so sorry, Emily.
I'm so sorry.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.926
Hey, deep breaths, John.
Deep breaths, okay?

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.529
You're gonna be fine.

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.598
I want to hear her voice.

hanging, honestly.

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:38.798
I want to know how this girl
got a second go at you, man?

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.667
I mean, I know that
if I got stood up like that,

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.836
I would have just set sail.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.362
How did your family take it?

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:49.266
JOHN: She, uh...

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:55.681
Trust me...

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:57.850
my family didn't take it well.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:08:02.021
My brothers
have very strong opinions,

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.747
and they're very vocal.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.059
Emily became Enemy Number 1,

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.953
but I wasn't gonna give up.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.609
JOHN: I actually liked it.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.778
Dating before seemed too easy.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.846
I was scared
to mess up this perfect

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:29.915
natural flow to marriage.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.951
I felt loose after the proposal.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:33.618
I was gonna have to earn it now,

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.310
and I loved the challenge.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:39.483

with Emily right now?

John, why in the world

01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:08.154
would you spend
another second with that girl?

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:10.323
She embarrassed you so bad, man.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.158

a cold-hearted woman, John.

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.047
I'm taking you to...

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:48.698
EMILY: (ON RADIO)
John?

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:54.504
John, can you hear me?

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:00.886
John?

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.412
Emily?

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:07.693
Yeah, yeah, I can
hear you, sweetheart.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.629
I love you. I love you.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:10.896
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.255
(COUGHS)

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:15.868
I love you, too.
Tell Lizzie I love her.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.003
I love you so much.
How are you?

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:20.706
Are you doing okay?

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.007
Yeah.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.309
Why?

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:28.213
I'm so much better now
than I was a minute ago.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.574
Thanks for coming down.

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.919
How are you?
How is the family?

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:35.521
John, stop.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.057
Stop. Stop it.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.559
Let's just focus on

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.060
getting you out of there, okay?

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.995
Yeah.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.931
I'm so sorry for putting you
through this.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:49.459
I shouldn't be down here.
Forgive me.

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.796
I miss you.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:57.634
(SOBBING)

01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:00.804
John, I'm pregnant.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.374
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:08.812
You're gonna be a father again.

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:20.199
I had the...
This was a surprise.

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:22.234
Oh, Ems, I love you so much.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:25.571
I love you. You have
to get back up here, okay?

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.940
Because we're gonna tell
everybody together.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:31.744
I know. I know.

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:34.313
I got to get out of here.
I love you. I'm so sorry.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:36.338
I love you so much.
I'll be up soon.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:40.119
I love you.
I love you so much.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.622
(STATIC CRACKLING)

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:44.590
John?

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:48.852
Emily?
Emily, I love you. Ems?

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.097
John?

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.133
Emily!

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:57.861
I love you. I love you.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.446
JOHN: Get me out of here!

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.949
(SOBBING)
Get me out of here.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.817
I want to get out of here.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.710
I can't be here anymore.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:19.659
I don't want to be
in this cave anymore!

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.450
(COUGHING)

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:32.271
I got to get out.
I have to get out.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:35.875
Lift me out.
Look, just pull me out.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.901
Just pull me out of here.

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.203
(SOBBING)

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.844
AARON: That's okay.
Hold on, buddy.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:53.850
Hey...

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.386
Are you there?

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:04.260
I just got to pray.

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:07.930
I know it sounds dumb.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:11.210
No, it doesn't sound dumb.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.078
It doesn't sound dumb at all.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:17.273
Let's just try to avoid another
one of those, okay, buddy?

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.752
We're going to need you
to focus on your breathing.

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:23.222
I know that sounds weird,
but I need you to think

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.348
about every breath
you take, all right?

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.729
AARON: John?

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:46.903
AARON: John?

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:53.475
(AARON GRUNTS)
Hey, John,

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:55.520
I need you
to focus on your breathing.

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.790
Okay, I know that sounds weird
but I need you to think

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:00.292
about every breath
that you're taking, all right?

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:03.195
I'm just so tired.
I know.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:04.764
I know.

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:06.790
Just do some
in and outs, it'll help.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:10.059
So that's how breathing works.

01:17:11.995 --> 01:17:14.373
How do you do it?
Huh?

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:16.441
Stay so calm.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.903
It just comes with the job.
You just don't think.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.606
You've never been scared?

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.679
I'm a...

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:33.082
I'm a different case altogether,
John, to be honest with you.

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:38.421
How so?

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:42.992
I...

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.999
I just think you can't care
what happens to you.

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:56.348
You went down in this cave

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:59.008
with me the entire time, and...

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:05.490
...helping me,

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.683
trying to get me
out of this hole.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:18.337
And, man, don't do that.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:21.030
Hey, I don't have
a family like you, John.

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:26.345
And what happened at Crandall
Mines a couple of years back,

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.505
it just... just shook everybody.

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:35.888
And to see families grow up
without a...

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:40.525
without a dad, just...

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.052
makes you start thinking,
"Well, why wasn't I there?"

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:48.901
We lost three rescuers that day,
and they were good men.

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:51.160
Really good men.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.032
Why did I live?

01:18:58.001 --> 01:19:00.145
Eventually, you just gotta go
into these situations

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:06.175
and tell yourself,
"Well, if this is it, fine.

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:10.413
It's my life now,
and it's working for me."

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:15.952
JOHN: That's the worst idea
I've ever heard.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:23.126
I mean, it sounds cliché, but...

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:29.799
what good is life if you're
just waiting to die, you know?

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.937
And I'm saying that from here.

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:39.708
What are you doing to me, man?

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:48.818
I'm so tired.

FEMALE REPORTER:
Emotionally drained,

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.942
rescuers try desperately

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:18.243
to continue the recovery effort.

Part of the problem is that

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:21.113
the only real options we have

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.948
are those that were
employed yesterday.

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:25.084
MALE REPORTER:
Rescuers bolted a pulley system

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:27.086
into the rock for more leverage.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.688

raising system to hold him

in position to a level spot

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.458

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:34.917

you to take a swig.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:58.907
It's coming down.

to stay awake for me.

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:04.747

Good.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.665
Well, we've got our to-do list.

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.735

And of all places to find out

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:33.176
you're having another baby.

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:42.361
I wonder
if this is what it feels like

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:44.863
being inside of the womb.

01:23:44.887 --> 01:23:49.725
Oh, you're probably on the right
track. Congrats, though.

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:56.199
You know
what still blows my mind?

01:23:59.068 --> 01:24:02.614
I thought
I had it all figured out.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:08.311
A beautiful wife,
family, career.

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.314
I wanted...

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:16.919
You know what I learned?

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:23.868
You want to know what
it takes to be a real man?

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.372
(MUSIC PLAYING)

AARON: Hey...

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:37.202
You there?

01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:39.371
Hey, you know, I want you
to stay awake for me.

01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:41.964
John? Are you there?

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.202
We're about ready
to pull you out.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:51.507
You with me on that?

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:55.454
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:55.478 --> 01:26:56.721
Okay.

01:26:56.745 --> 01:26:58.080
JOHN: Wait.

01:27:00.249 --> 01:27:01.650
Can I talk to Emily first?

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:05.730
They had to pull
the cable back up

01:27:05.754 --> 01:27:08.066
or it might get caught
on the rope.

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:11.427
But she's here, John.
She's with you, okay?

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:23.906
Okay.

01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:28.052
JOHN: Can you promise
me one thing?

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.678
Yeah, anything.

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.825
Can you promise to tell Emily

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:35.427
that no matter what,

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:38.053
I'll be there
when the baby is born?

01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:45.704
I thought we weren't going
to talk like this, John.

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.006
I know.

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.698
Just promise me.

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.877
Please?

Yeah.

get you out of here, John.

01:28:06.582 --> 01:28:08.427
Yeah.

01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:10.319
Okay.

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:23.642
Emily, it's time.

All right, Susie, it's all yours.

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.605
Here we go!

Okay. Okay!

she deserves to be happy,
all right, so...

01:39:06.975 --> 01:39:09.411

love her like I did.

that your mother can give

01:39:26.828 --> 01:39:29.064
when she is the happiest.

no greater feeling in the world.
