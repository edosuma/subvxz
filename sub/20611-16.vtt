00:01.202 --> 00:04.338
[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:10.778
*

00:10.811 --> 00:13.647
- My name is Jack Barber.
The shop I work in,

00:13.681 --> 00:16.750
it's a blacksmith shop
from the 1880s.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.620
I'm 68 years old,
but I can keep up with anybody

00:19.653 --> 00:21.589
that wants to pound metal
into a blade.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.524
- My name is Michael Cross.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.060
Bladesmithing is
a never-ending skill set.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.661
I am not fully trained,

00:27.695 --> 00:30.498
so I've got some
very unique approaches

00:30.531 --> 00:32.366
to get the job done.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.801
- My name's Todd Martin.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.569
I work for a crane company,

00:35.603 --> 00:37.571
and I have
a blacksmith business.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.573
I like doing it
the old-fashioned way,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.342
all hand tools,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.111
and I like the old tools.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.279
I don't buy a lot of new stuff.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.481
- My name is Leland
Edward Stone.

00:47.515 --> 00:51.652
I'm a blacksmith in a theme park
in Buena Park, California.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.488
I can move a hammer
like nobody's business.

00:54.522 --> 00:58.326
If we're reduced to working
with a campfire and a rock,

00:58.359 --> 01:01.329
I'm the guy
to win this competition.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.365
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the scrapyard.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.766
You're here to engage
in three rounds

01:05.799 --> 01:07.535
of bladesmithing competition

01:07.568 --> 01:09.837
designed to test
every aspect of your skills,

01:09.870 --> 01:12.306
and of course after every round,
you'll be presenting your work

01:12.340 --> 01:14.742
to our panel of expert judges.
Let's meet them now.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.611
ABS Mastersmith J. Neilson.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.614
Historic weapons recreation
specialist David Baker.

01:20.648 --> 01:24.385
Edged weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.819
I'm sure you've assessed by now

01:25.853 --> 01:27.655
that because you're
at the scrapyard,

01:27.688 --> 01:29.157
that means that
you'll be harvesting

01:29.190 --> 01:30.791
the steel that you need

01:30.824 --> 01:32.893
to make signature blades
in your signature style

01:32.926 --> 01:35.163
from the scrap around you.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.599
- I work almost entirely
with scrap material,

01:38.632 --> 01:41.769
so being here is perfect
for my oddball blend

01:41.802 --> 01:44.472
of interests and experiences.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.341
- And you'll also
be using these...

01:47.375 --> 01:50.178
*

01:50.211 --> 01:52.180
Coal forges.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.847
- The coal forges are
a little bit

01:53.881 --> 01:55.916
more restricting
than I'm used to.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.619
I have a big brick forge
where I do most of my work,

01:58.652 --> 02:00.754
so I'm feeling nervous.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.325
- The length of your blades must
fall between 10 and 13 inches.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.160
The overall length
of your weapon

02:06.194 --> 02:08.329
must not exceed 22 inches.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.198
Additionally, you must include

02:10.231 --> 02:13.567
a hidden tang design
in your blade shape.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.603
Keep in mind that
in the second round,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.338
you'll be putting handles
on those blades

02:17.371 --> 02:19.540
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

02:19.573 --> 02:22.743
that will be tested for strength
and durability in a bone chop

02:22.776 --> 02:26.414
and for edge retention
in a sandbag slice.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.716
Bladesmiths,
you will have four hours

02:28.749 --> 02:32.286
in this round of competition
to complete your work.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.355
Oh, and one more thing.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.757
There will be no design period.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.794
Good luck.
Your 4 hours starts now.

02:40.828 --> 02:45.533
*

02:45.566 --> 02:47.368
- The hardest part
about choosing

02:47.401 --> 02:49.403
some sort of recyclable material

02:49.437 --> 02:51.205
is you want to make sure
it's some good quality steel

02:51.239 --> 02:52.973
that can be hardened.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.808
- I start looking at stuff
and seeing

02:54.842 --> 02:57.378
how much work it's gonna be
to use that piece,

02:57.411 --> 02:59.880
how fast I can cut off of that.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
What is the easiest time limit

03:02.283 --> 03:04.418
and get the best blade out
of that material?

03:04.452 --> 03:07.321
I'll just do this.
- Todd's coming back with

03:07.355 --> 03:09.457
a pretty wide piece of steel
right there.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.924
I have no idea what that is.
- It looks like it was--

03:10.958 --> 03:12.693
oh, that's a mower blade.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.895
- Oh, yeah.
That's a huge bush hog blade.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.299
- Yeah, that's a great choice.
More than likely 5160 also.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.934
- I want to go with
a working bush knife

03:20.968 --> 03:23.737
because I know it'll perform
against the sharpness

03:23.771 --> 03:26.907
and the chop test.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.776
- Picking a metal

03:28.809 --> 03:30.444
is gonna represent
a little bit of a challenge

03:30.478 --> 03:32.012
'cause some of the steel

03:32.045 --> 03:33.614
could've had
a really rough history,

03:33.647 --> 03:36.417
which could include
micro fractures.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.619
You don't see these things,

03:38.652 --> 03:40.721
but they can reveal themselves
whenever you do the heat treat.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.523
- Michael's got a pry bar.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.392
- Is that gonna be
a high-carbon content?

03:44.425 --> 03:45.759
- It depends.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.994
We've had some
that were really good.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.462
We've had some
that were sketchy.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.830
- I've made some swords before,

03:49.863 --> 03:51.499
but a knife that size

03:51.532 --> 03:53.301
is a little
out of my comfort zone

03:53.334 --> 03:55.469
so I'm gonna make
a Japanese tonto.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.805
It doesn't really include
a lot of fancy hammer work,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.573
but it can also be
a very functional blade.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.276
- My bladesmithing style

04:02.310 --> 04:05.045
is something
I call "scrounge technology."

04:05.078 --> 04:07.348
I like digging
through scrap piles

04:07.381 --> 04:10.050
and seeing what nuggets
I can come up with.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.820
I see a stack of leaf springs.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.422
I'm on that.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.724
- A leaf spring.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.626
What do we think of that steel
for use in this competition?

04:18.659 --> 04:21.429
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- I'm making a bowie knife

04:21.462 --> 04:23.864
because it's a form
I'm fairly comfortable with,

04:23.897 --> 04:26.600
and I think I can pull it off
in the time allotted.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.936
*

04:28.969 --> 04:32.005
- I'm looking around in a sea
of all kinds of materials

04:32.039 --> 04:33.974
that we could use, saying,
"That's soft."

04:34.007 --> 04:35.643
"That's too hard,"

04:35.676 --> 04:37.578
or "That's gonna be
way too difficult

04:37.611 --> 04:40.080
to forge in four hours."

04:40.113 --> 04:42.350
I go to the leaf spring.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.084
All right.
I've seen what happens

04:44.117 --> 04:46.620
when they go on those cow bones
with a knife,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.489
so now I want to make sure
that my knife

04:48.522 --> 04:51.459
would withstand
that kind of abuse.

04:51.492 --> 04:55.095
I'm doing a seax,
which is a very primitive,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.598
Scandinavian-type knife.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.900
*

04:59.933 --> 05:01.502
- I like watching
the different smiths.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.637
Some of 'em are cranking
like maniacs.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.705
You got Jack over here,
who's just going nice

05:04.738 --> 05:06.607
and slow and steady.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
That's one of the things
about coal.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.044
You spend almost as much time
maintaining your fire

05:11.078 --> 05:12.813
as you do working on your steel.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.748
- Come on.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.050
This ought to be blowing by now.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.719
I'm having a little trouble.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.655
I'm not able to get
the airflow right.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.024
- He doesn't have his air vent
opened up at the base.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.659
- What the heck?

05:25.693 --> 05:26.760
- He's not getting
air through that.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.663
- Come on. Stay up.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.565
Air leakage, the bottom.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.834
*

05:33.867 --> 05:36.036
This is the ultimate test,

05:36.069 --> 05:38.706
just to see what you can do
under pressure

05:38.739 --> 05:41.942
against whatever odds
are thrown to you.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.377
*

05:43.411 --> 05:45.646
I'm a little nervous.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.748
*

05:47.781 --> 05:49.950
- I've got a coal forge,
so I'm just stoked at that.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.985
I love just heating it up

05:52.019 --> 05:53.954
and just being able
to baby the fire

05:53.987 --> 05:55.155
and pound that steel out.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.091
It's just so satisfying.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.794
I'm looking for any early signs

06:00.828 --> 06:03.531
that this steel is gonna be
a problem for me later on.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.033
It looks good.
It's not chipping, crumbling,

06:06.066 --> 06:09.903
cracking, doing anything
that's causing any worry.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.639
- First thing I want to do
is make sure

06:11.672 --> 06:14.508
this is gonna be
worth expending resources on.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.844
- Did I just see Leland put
a very small piece

06:16.877 --> 06:18.846
of that steel in his fire?
- Yeah.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.114
- I think Leland's running
a piece of test metal.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.684
- That's not a bad idea.
- It's a pretty smart idea.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.819
- I have a good idea of

06:25.853 --> 06:29.189
how it's going to respond
to heat treating later on.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.693
That's one other variable
I've taken off the table.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.595
*

06:34.628 --> 06:36.564
- The steel I started
with was pretty heavy,

06:36.597 --> 06:38.599
which will mean it'll make
a stronger knife,

06:38.632 --> 06:42.102
but it's just gonna take a whole
lot longer to forge it out.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.638
I start on the tang because
if you don't leave enough metal

06:44.672 --> 06:46.106
when you pull the tang out,

06:46.139 --> 06:48.609
you end up with a tang
that's too short.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.944
I want a tang
that's gonna be uniform

06:50.978 --> 06:53.080
so that it'll make it easier
for me to make the handles

06:53.113 --> 06:54.748
and adjust it later on.

06:54.782 --> 06:58.185
- Bladesmiths,
1 hour has elapsed.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.988
You have 3 hours remaining
to finish your work.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.492
*

07:04.525 --> 07:07.227
- Now that I'm able to draw
this thing out,

07:07.260 --> 07:09.697
I'm able to relax,

07:09.730 --> 07:12.199
and it's looking good from here.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.067
- I think Todd's starting to see
a little light

07:14.101 --> 07:17.004
at the end of the tunnel.
It looks good, man.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.039
- My plan's to quench about
the last 30 minutes,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.543
so all good laid plans.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.745
*

07:24.778 --> 07:26.614
- My competitors are seasoned,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.916
and they know
what they're doing,

07:28.949 --> 07:32.720
so, you know, my OCD
is running pretty high.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.622
I'm scrutinizing this blade,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.890
staring at every angle,

07:36.924 --> 07:40.093
just assessing
any little issues.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.729
I'm constantly taking
measurements,

07:41.762 --> 07:42.896
double-checking and critiquing

07:42.930 --> 07:44.632
every little bit of it as I go.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.166
- Yeah,
I'm worried about Michael.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.201
- My concern is
him being so meticulous

07:48.235 --> 07:50.704
that he kills himself on time.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.173
- I really have a lot of little
things that I want to fix.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.575
It can always be better, always.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.209
There's no question.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.945
- Anybody watching Leland?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.980
Looks like he don't have
a care in the world.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.517
Like, "Okay, just a Saturday
afternoon in the backyard."

08:03.551 --> 08:07.054
- The simple device I use to
maintain a consistent thickness,

08:07.087 --> 08:09.289
I call it a kiss block.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.192
The kiss block limits the
downward travel of the hammer

08:12.225 --> 08:14.094
against the hot
and pliable stock.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.663
- That way he's not
gonna have issues

08:15.696 --> 08:18.832
with deep hammer marks later on.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.301
*

08:21.334 --> 08:23.303
- At this point,
I'm having to do many more heats

08:23.336 --> 08:25.839
than I normally do
to get the tang stretched out.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.741
*

08:27.775 --> 08:30.811
Now it's too long,
so I cut it off.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.214
Disastrous.
Drew it out some more.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.284
- So it looks like Jack's
going back after that tang.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.687
- He's spent over
an hour hammering on that thing.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.955
- Yeah, he's a tang-aholic.
- He's a tang-aholic.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.593
*

08:45.626 --> 08:47.795
- I'm about to quench.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.330
Trying to get my blade
to about 1,450 degrees.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.300
I'm concerned
about warping my blade.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.870
*

08:56.904 --> 08:58.606
- Bladesmiths,

08:58.639 --> 09:01.108
you have just
30 minutes remaining

09:01.141 --> 09:03.010
to finish your work.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.812
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.279
- Getting tired.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.148
*

09:08.181 --> 09:11.919
- There's a part of it
that's a little soft.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.121
I know I need a second quench,

09:14.154 --> 09:16.690
and I know that
I don't have enough time

09:16.724 --> 09:20.060
to be able to heat
this blade totally up again,

09:20.093 --> 09:22.730
so I'm just gonna do
an edge quench.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.898
This has to work.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.800
It's a go or no-go right now.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.836
*

09:28.869 --> 09:30.037
[sighs]

09:30.070 --> 09:32.339
*

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
- So to make myself stand out
in this challenge,

09:34.407 --> 09:37.210
I am gonna pull
a lot of little tricks.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.347
So I go off to the scrap piles

09:40.380 --> 09:42.950
and I find a couple pieces
of angle iron,

09:42.983 --> 09:46.687
and I stack them
down the middle of my forge.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.790
- Michael's actually made
himself a heating chamber.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.959
So instead of sliding back
and forth and playing with it,

09:51.992 --> 09:55.663
he'll have 360 degrees
of heat around that blade.

09:55.696 --> 09:59.099
He puts that in there and gets
it nice and even for a quench.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.368
*

10:01.401 --> 10:04.972
- Now I've got the form
that I'm gonna be using,

10:05.005 --> 10:07.107
it's time to harden it.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.910
And guess what?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.244
My fire's gone out.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.280
*

10:13.313 --> 10:16.416
Is it stressful seeing
the coal completely out?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.385
No.
[chuckles]

10:18.418 --> 10:21.088
- Leland's struggling
to get a fire going here.

10:21.121 --> 10:25.225
- At this point it's real
difficult not to panic,

10:25.258 --> 10:27.995
but since I tested the steel,

10:28.028 --> 10:31.932
I am sure it's gonna work
in the heat treat.

10:31.965 --> 10:38.906
*

10:41.408 --> 10:43.443
- I see it's got
a little warp in it.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.345
That's got me concerned

10:45.378 --> 10:47.881
because it's heat-treated now.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.918
Do I leave this alone,
or do I play with it

10:50.951 --> 10:52.886
and risk breaking it?

10:52.920 --> 10:57.190
My instinct is screaming,
"Don't mess with it."

10:57.224 --> 11:00.193
I just can't help myself.
I have to adjust this warp.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.429
*

11:02.462 --> 11:04.798
If this fails,

11:04.832 --> 11:07.034
I don't have enough time left
to make another blade.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.469
- I'm really getting worried
about Michael.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.105
If he tries
to force that warp out too far,

11:12.139 --> 11:18.245
it's gonna go snap.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.949
- I just can't help myself.
I have to adjust this warp.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.184
I am horrified.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.419
This is how people
get kicked out,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.288
this is how people break blades,

11:28.321 --> 11:30.824
so I'm just really
gently applying heat

11:30.858 --> 11:32.926
and babying this thing.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.962
If this fails,

11:34.995 --> 11:37.130
I don't have enough time left
to make another blade.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.933
This is a whole
hell of a lot better.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.835
*

11:41.869 --> 11:44.738
- My blade is hitting
the edge of the forge,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.107
so I'm having to move
the blade back and forth

11:47.140 --> 11:49.242
to get the whole blade
to quenching heat.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
One end is starting to cool down

11:51.044 --> 11:52.846
while the other end
is heating up,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.147
and so I'm frantically
trying to get the heat

11:54.181 --> 11:56.383
as high as possible,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.351
and I don't have
a lot of time left.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.888
*

12:00.921 --> 12:03.791
- Ten, nine, eight,

12:03.824 --> 12:06.894
seven, six, five,

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
four, three,

12:08.962 --> 12:11.131
two, one.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.900
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines

12:12.933 --> 12:14.201
and drop your tools.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.936
This round is over.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.405
We will be reconvening
back at our Forge,

12:18.438 --> 12:21.174
where the judges
will evaluate your work.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.945
- [sighs]
I am really apprehensive.

12:24.978 --> 12:28.882
The judges can find
any little flaw.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.484
There's a chance
I could be going home.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.021
- All right, bladesmiths.
Welcome to our Forge.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.123
Now that your blades
have been forged,

12:36.156 --> 12:38.558
it's time for the judges
to take a look at your work.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.360
Jack, you're up first.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.562
Please present your blade
to the judges.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.432
*

12:45.465 --> 12:49.102
- Overall, your blade
is solid-looking.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.004
The tang is slightly off
from the blade,

12:51.038 --> 12:53.841
but it's got that
seax look to it.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.208
- You were moving steel
pretty good,

12:55.242 --> 12:56.443
but most of it was back here.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.145
I saw you draw out that tang.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.512
You shortened it up twice,
didn't you?

12:59.546 --> 13:02.215
- Yes.
- It's still pretty thick.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.851
- Michael, you're up.
Please present your work

13:03.884 --> 13:06.353
to the judges.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.989
- Michael, you got the
proportions on this very nice.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.958
I'd definitely like to see you
thin this out some,

13:10.991 --> 13:13.493
make it a little bit lighter,
but overall, nicely done.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.829
- Well, you forged
this beautifully.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.831
You did a lot of finish work
with your forging.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.232
It was good watching you work.
Thank you.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.268
- Thank you.
- Todd, you're up.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.871
*

13:23.904 --> 13:26.439
- Well, Todd, for the test,
we're doing bone chop.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.876
It's good to see a spine
that can back that up.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.410
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.213
- It's good work.
Your blade's very sharp,

13:33.246 --> 13:35.215
and I think,
of all of our blades,

13:35.248 --> 13:38.251
you have the most defined
actual edge on yours.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.087
- Thank you.
- Leland.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.489
*

13:42.522 --> 13:45.192
- What I'm seeing is there's
a little bit of a warp,

13:45.225 --> 13:48.896
and it doesn't just warp
but twists a little bit.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.164
- You got a nice,
thick tang to work with.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.633
I've got one question
for you though.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.937
Why is the spine and the edge
the same thickness?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.073
- I presumed I would address
that with later grinding.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.209
- Okay.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.078
- Bladesmiths, as a group,
these are the best blades

14:05.112 --> 14:07.247
we've ever had
come out of a Round one

14:07.280 --> 14:09.116
where coal forges were used,

14:09.149 --> 14:10.918
which means that the judges'
final decision

14:10.951 --> 14:12.285
is gonna be very difficult.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.486
So while they go
into deliberation,

14:13.520 --> 14:16.957
please step off the Forge floor.

14:16.990 --> 14:23.596
*

14:23.630 --> 14:27.234
- [sighs]
So judges, moving forward,

14:27.267 --> 14:28.969
I think it's safe to say that

14:29.002 --> 14:31.104
Michael is definitely
in the clear, correct?

14:31.138 --> 14:33.673
- Yeah.
- Is there another bladesmith

14:33.706 --> 14:35.909
definitely moving into Round 2?
both: Todd.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.177
- Everybody's
in agreement there.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.246
So our decision comes down

14:39.279 --> 14:41.648
to two leaf spring blades.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.450
We'll start with Jack's blade
on the end there.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.386
- I just hope the tang
isn't a major issue.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.455
*

14:48.488 --> 14:51.658
- Jack spent more than
half his time making a tang.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.061
Even with all that work,
it gets fatter.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.562
It doesn't taper.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.664
He's gonna have
a lot of grinding to do.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.100
- A bit of a warp in the blade.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.701
I'd like to see that corrected,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.337
but my question
is how hard is it?

15:04.371 --> 15:07.274
*

15:07.307 --> 15:08.976
It's skating on pretty good.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.111
- All right,
and our last bladesmith, Leland.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.614
- That warp-twist thing
has got me worried now.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.584
*

15:17.617 --> 15:19.552
- He's got a warp in the blade.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.089
It swings quite a bit off
to the right there.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.525
*

15:25.558 --> 15:28.028
That just seems harder
on the ends

15:28.061 --> 15:29.562
and softer in the middle.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.531
- Judges, you have
a final decision to make.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.433
Doug, have you made yours?
- Yes, I have.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.467
- Dave?
- Yep.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.735
- J.?
- Yeah.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.737
- Let's go tell our smiths.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.240
*

15:40.273 --> 15:42.009
The judges' deliberation
is complete,

15:42.042 --> 15:44.277
and they've made
a final decision.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.746
The bladesmith who's leaving
the Forge is...

15:46.779 --> 15:50.750
*

15:50.783 --> 15:52.219
Leland.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.455
Your blade did not make the cut.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.390
- You know, Leland, it was
a pleasure watching you work.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.259
Your control of the steel
and the fire

15:59.292 --> 16:01.461
was amazing to watch,

16:01.494 --> 16:04.031
but during your quench, you
developed a warp in your blade,

16:04.064 --> 16:05.498
and the fact that
when I file checked it.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.766
There's a soft spot
in the center

16:06.799 --> 16:08.635
that didn't harden properly.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.204
Those are the reasons
we're sending you home.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.107
- Leland, please
surrender your blade.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.209
- I feel disappointed.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.579
I should've been more careful
about my heat treating,

16:19.612 --> 16:23.116
but I'm elated
at having been here.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.485
Has my love of blademaking
increased because of this?

16:25.518 --> 16:28.121
Absolutely.
I'm not moving on,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.590
but I feel like
I'm moving forward,

16:30.623 --> 16:34.094
and I'll take that.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.628
*

16:35.662 --> 16:37.164
- All right, bladesmiths.
Good job.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.665
You've made it
to the second round,

16:38.698 --> 16:40.633
and now that your blades
have been tempered,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.169
it's time to turn them
into fully-functional weapons

16:42.202 --> 16:43.736
by attaching handles to them.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.173
The stipulation
for this round is that

16:46.206 --> 16:50.643
you must include a metal frame
for the tang of your blades.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.712
You will have 3 hours
in this round.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.114
When the time runs out

16:54.147 --> 16:56.249
and your
blades have been tested,

16:56.283 --> 16:58.118
one of you will have
to surrender his weapon

16:58.151 --> 17:00.153
and leave the Forge.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.490
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your 3 hours starts now.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.826
*

17:06.859 --> 17:10.630
- If these guys are just gonna
frame that tang in metal,

17:10.663 --> 17:13.400
why didn't they just do
a full tang to begin with?

17:13.433 --> 17:16.336
- A lot of times, the reasons
for doing a metal frame is

17:16.369 --> 17:18.571
when you want to do something
like a big bowie knife,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.107
there's no way you would
get that guard

17:20.140 --> 17:22.075
over that onto the shoulders

17:22.109 --> 17:23.476
'cause it's actually bigger
than the shoulders.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.378
- So this is
a technical challenge.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.415
- Yeah, you got to put
a little thought into it.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.350
- I want to attack
the frame first

17:30.383 --> 17:33.653
because it's something
I'm not familiar with.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.789
I get my frame all cut out...

17:36.823 --> 17:38.858
A little off.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.828
And it's not fitting.
It's too tight.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.596
*

17:43.630 --> 17:46.566
Well, it's still too thick
back there.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.435
It's a little frustrating.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.871
*

17:51.904 --> 17:54.441
All right, better.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.210
I was relieved to finally get it

17:57.244 --> 17:59.612
to where it fits
in there perfectly.

17:59.646 --> 18:03.116
*

18:03.150 --> 18:04.884
- I have never done
a metal frame before ever.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.619
*

18:06.653 --> 18:08.355
It's time to go to plan B,

18:08.388 --> 18:11.591
and I don't even know
what plan B is.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.294
I'm just gonna go right ahead
and try to cover the whole tang

18:14.327 --> 18:17.330
with that piece of metal
and attach the sides to that.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.432
*

18:19.466 --> 18:21.501
- I'm not sure
if he's getting the concept

18:21.534 --> 18:24.537
that you need to see a frame
all the way around the handle.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.306
- It goes all the way around.
It's a horseshoe.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.209
- No, I know, but there's not
a lot of space

18:29.242 --> 18:31.578
between the edges of that bar
he's got there and his tang,

18:31.611 --> 18:35.215
so it's gonna be a very,
very narrow handle.

18:35.248 --> 18:39.919
*

18:39.952 --> 18:42.489
- We have to make this
metal frame around the tang,

18:42.522 --> 18:45.458
and I have
never done this before.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.227
- We really might've whizzed

18:47.260 --> 18:49.362
in Michael's Cheerios
with this challenge

18:49.396 --> 18:50.630
'cause I don't think
I've ever seen a tonto

18:50.663 --> 18:54.567
with a framed handle before.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.404
- I start shaping out
that pocket

18:57.437 --> 18:58.905
and try to get it
as close to fit

18:58.938 --> 19:01.374
as I can with the frame.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.344
I have no training
or formal instruction.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.413
Part of why I'm here
is I can prove

19:06.446 --> 19:09.316
that you put your mind to it
and develop that skill

19:09.349 --> 19:12.785
and you can hang
with the big dogs.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.723
- Bladesmiths,
you have one hour remaining.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.926
- I trace out the shape
of my tang on my wood

19:19.959 --> 19:23.296
so that I can drill holes
in my wood and my tang.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.797
*

19:24.831 --> 19:26.666
When I go to drill a hole

19:26.699 --> 19:28.368
to put the wood in the handle,
it shifts.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.437
[bleep].
I got a big gap over there.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.572
What's going on there?

19:32.605 --> 19:35.775
*

19:35.808 --> 19:37.677
- There's a lot of ways
to get your pins to line up

19:37.710 --> 19:39.246
and slide through.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.847
Just using a larger drill bit

19:40.880 --> 19:42.582
and knocking the edges
off those holes

19:42.615 --> 19:43.983
so when you're pushing
your pin through,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.219
it wants to line up.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.755
- I know I don't have a lot
of time left on the clock.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.823
I want to do everything
I can to pull this off

19:50.857 --> 19:52.292
'cause I don't want to go home.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.760
[exhales sharply]

19:53.793 --> 19:55.828
I'm stressing out.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.530
[sighs]

19:57.564 --> 20:04.737
I can't believe
this is happening.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.574
The pins won't fit
through the tang.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.442
These two pins
is what it's getting.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.312
*

20:12.345 --> 20:14.347
And that.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.249
Okay.

20:16.283 --> 20:19.286
Finally I'm able to get
the holes lined up,

20:19.319 --> 20:20.920
and I've got to catch up.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.290
You guys are ahead
of the game already.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.459
*

20:26.493 --> 20:28.595
- I strained a little making
the metal frame to begin with,

20:28.628 --> 20:29.929
but I think
I've got a handle on it now,

20:29.962 --> 20:32.865
so I'm getting ready
to glue it on.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.568
I'm pretty sure that the epoxies
will be more than enough,

20:35.602 --> 20:37.604
and it will hold fine.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.372
I actually am weakening my tang

20:39.406 --> 20:41.474
if I put a vertical
drill hole through it

20:41.508 --> 20:43.610
and fill it with a pin,
so I'd rather not do that.

20:43.643 --> 20:47.314
*

20:47.347 --> 20:50.950
- I haven't seen Jack drill
any holes in his frame,

20:50.983 --> 20:52.819
so I'm hoping he's not
just gonna count on epoxy

20:52.852 --> 20:54.754
to hold that frame together

20:54.787 --> 20:57.490
'cause, you know,
we can start chopping on bone

20:57.524 --> 20:59.392
and just blow that frame
right off

20:59.426 --> 21:02.529
if that epoxy doesn't hold up.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.331
*

21:04.364 --> 21:06.833
- I'm going to give it
the contours

21:06.866 --> 21:09.035
of a traditional-style tonto,

21:09.068 --> 21:11.404
and I feel like that's gonna
help guide your hand

21:11.438 --> 21:15.074
to the sweet spot of the handle.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.578
- I like what Michael did.
He's got--where the ricasso is,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.813
that handle material flares out.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.883
So he's almost building in,
like, an integral guard.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.318
- And then it flares again
at the base.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.053
- Yeah.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.855
*

21:28.888 --> 21:30.623
- I glue my handle up.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.859
Now I just have to wait
for it to dry.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.562
It's stressing me out.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.831
- Bladesmiths, you still have
30 minutes remaining

21:38.865 --> 21:41.067
to get some work done.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.871
- Oh, Lord help me, Jesus.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.574
I have a pin nightmare.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.809
A total of seven pins

21:49.842 --> 21:53.112
in the frame alone.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.515
Come on.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.417
I don't even
have it sharpened yet.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.719
There's 20 minutes left.
I'm dying.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.621
- That's always a little bit
of a hairy spot

22:01.654 --> 22:03.122
when you've got that many pins
to worry about

22:03.155 --> 22:04.824
lining everything up
and getting it together.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.559
- Yes.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.429
*

22:09.462 --> 22:10.963
- My metal frame has been glued
in nice and tight,

22:10.997 --> 22:13.065
so I'm trying to do
the final sharpening

22:13.099 --> 22:15.101
and forming
on my blade right now.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.036
You know,
you're always concerned about

22:17.069 --> 22:18.705
how sharp your knife is
because they're putting it

22:18.738 --> 22:21.574
through two
very different tests.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.477
I haven't made a lot of big,
long blades,

22:24.511 --> 22:28.748
and that's a whole different way
of sharpening something.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.784
- Ten, nine, eight,

22:31.818 --> 22:34.754
seven, six, five,

22:34.787 --> 22:36.623
four, three,

22:36.656 --> 22:38.791
two, one.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.893
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.762
This round is over.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.964
- I'm feeling very,
very nervous.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.033
You know, you always wonder
if your knife is gonna make it

22:47.066 --> 22:50.036
no matter how many times
you go over things.

22:50.069 --> 22:53.172
- This is our strength test,
smiths, the bone chop.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.508
I'm gonna take
each of your blades,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.977
and I'm gonna smash them
three downward strikes

22:58.010 --> 22:59.879
onto these thick bones.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.515
- This is gonna suck.
Now, keep in mind,

23:02.549 --> 23:04.984
I'm not worried about seeing how
far I can get into these bones.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.419
What I want to see
is what these bones

23:06.453 --> 23:07.954
are gonna do to your blades.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.589
How are you feeling, Todd?

23:09.622 --> 23:10.990
- A little nervous.
- Okay.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.460
*

23:13.493 --> 23:15.828
- I'm a little nervous about
the heat treat on my blade.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.697
*

23:17.730 --> 23:20.166
That bone chop
is very tough stuff,

23:20.199 --> 23:23.135
brutal on an edge.

23:23.169 --> 23:30.076
*

23:37.817 --> 23:39.819
- Todd, you got
a heavy blade here.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.821
I mean, if it wasn't
for those contours,

23:41.854 --> 23:43.990
I don't think I would've been
able to hold onto this knife.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.593
But overall, it survived.
Good job.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.495
- Thank you.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.029
- Michael, you've got
a lot of pins in there.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.197
You think it's gonna
hold everything on?

23:51.230 --> 23:52.765
- Oh, I sure hope so.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.034
- Let's find out.

23:55.067 --> 24:02.041
*

24:10.950 --> 24:13.185
- [laughs softly]

24:13.219 --> 24:14.621
- It was very comfortable
in the hand.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.556
It was very well-balanced.

24:16.589 --> 24:20.493
You did lose some of your epoxy,
so we got some gapping.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.562
That being said, I like the fact

24:22.595 --> 24:25.131
that you pinned through
the material in the tang

24:25.164 --> 24:26.633
as well as around
the perimeter of the frame.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.100
It was a very smart move.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.236
- Thank you.
- Little nervous, Jack?

24:30.269 --> 24:31.804
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

24:31.838 --> 24:33.673
*

24:33.706 --> 24:35.007
- Looking at the size
of the bone,

24:35.041 --> 24:38.077
it's really kind of scary,

24:38.110 --> 24:40.947
but I really feel
I've constructed a blade

24:40.980 --> 24:43.550
that will withstand
that kind of abuse.

24:43.583 --> 24:50.523
*

24:56.796 --> 24:58.531
- It survived, Jack.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.199
- Awesome.
[laughs softly]

25:00.232 --> 25:01.901
- Definitely dulled up the edge.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.270
I don't feel any sharpness
there at all now.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.640
The thing that really got me was
the handle pinching my fingers.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.009
I think if we kept striking
with this,

25:10.042 --> 25:11.778
it would eventually
come flying out.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.780
Overall, it survived.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.715
- Thank you.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.084
I'm feeling relief that
I still have a knife

25:18.117 --> 25:19.752
that's in one piece.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.253
- To see how sharp
your blades are,

25:21.287 --> 25:23.590
I will slash across
these sandbags.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.891
Todd, you're up first.
You ready?

25:24.924 --> 25:28.060
- I'm ready.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.329
I'm feeling pretty secure,
but a little nervous.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.700
I hope my edge is still sharp
after the chop

25:33.733 --> 25:35.301
to slice the bag.

25:35.334 --> 25:42.274
*

25:46.112 --> 25:49.115
- Well, Todd, your blade is
plenty sharp.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.151
The fact that the blade is heavy
and you have a short handle,

25:52.184 --> 25:55.588
it's harder to control 'cause
it wants to pull away from you,

25:55.622 --> 25:58.858
but overall, sir,
your blade will cut.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.359
- Thank you.
- Michael, you're up.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.295
You ready?
- Let's do it.

26:03.329 --> 26:10.269
*

26:11.738 --> 26:13.740
- Well, Michael,
I like how it feels.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.375
Despite having a larger handle,

26:16.408 --> 26:18.878
it balances the blade out.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.714
Overall, your blade will cut.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.849
- Thank you.
- Jack, you're up.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.183
Ready?
- I'm ready, sir.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.085
- Let's do this.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.889
- Michael is probably
number one at this point.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.191
Todd and I are probably
neck and neck,

26:32.224 --> 26:35.862
so I'm feeling very,
very nervous.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.301
All I'm waiting
for at this point is for Doug

26:42.334 --> 26:44.904
to say those famous words of,
"It will cut."

26:44.937 --> 26:51.878
*

26:54.113 --> 26:57.083
- All right, Jack.
When you grab onto it,

26:57.116 --> 26:59.418
you can feel
that it pushes into my palm.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.220
On a slash no problem,

27:01.253 --> 27:02.855
but I can see what J.
was talking about

27:02.889 --> 27:04.356
when you're hitting bone.

27:04.390 --> 27:07.226
But your blade will cut.
- Thank you, sir.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.295
I'm concerned
about the handle issue,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.297
but I'm gonna go ahead
with a positive attitude

27:11.330 --> 27:13.700
'cause that's the way I want
to approach the whole thing.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.268
*

27:16.302 --> 27:18.838
- Bladesmiths,
in roughly 7 hours,

27:18.871 --> 27:20.873
each of you
has selected scrap steel,

27:20.907 --> 27:22.909
coal-forged a blade,

27:22.942 --> 27:24.210
attached handles to them

27:24.243 --> 27:26.779
and endured weapons testing,

27:26.813 --> 27:28.948
but now it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.819
*

27:32.852 --> 27:36.789
Jack, your blade did
not make the cut.

27:36.823 --> 27:40.159
- Jack, a few things we saw
during the testing.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.762
Striking the bone definitely
dulled up the edge,

27:42.795 --> 27:45.998
and then, to be honest,
that handle was really pinching.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.768
It really hurt during
the testing, striking that bone.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.803
So these are the reasons we're
gonna have to let you go today.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.238
- Thank you.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.140
- Jack, please surrender
your weapon.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.709
*

27:56.743 --> 27:59.178
- I think my wife and family
are gonna be very proud.

27:59.211 --> 28:02.849
I'm very happy
that I was able to do this.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.851
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get home

28:04.884 --> 28:06.786
is I'm gonna kiss my wife
and pet my dog,

28:06.819 --> 28:09.756
and I'm gonna be really happy
I'm back on my own turf.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.725
*

28:12.759 --> 28:15.027
- Todd, Michael,
congratulations.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.396
You've made it into the final
round of this competition,

28:17.429 --> 28:19.498
which means that you're both one
step closer to the title

28:19.531 --> 28:23.302
of "Forged in Fire" champion
and that check for $10,000.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.071
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:25.104 --> 28:27.807
to recreate an iconic weapon
from history.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.110
That weapon is...

28:31.143 --> 28:34.446
the kampilan.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.984
According to legend,
the kampilan was the sword

28:38.017 --> 28:40.219
that killed explorer
Ferdinand Magellan

28:40.252 --> 28:43.122
at The Battle of Mactan
in what is now the Philippines.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.991
The heavy, spur-tipped sword

28:45.024 --> 28:47.059
was used by island warriors
in battle

28:47.093 --> 28:50.229
and could chop off two heads
in one swing.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.164
The single-edged blade
could also cut

28:52.198 --> 28:54.901
through its scabbard
with no resistance,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.502
allowing it
to be quickly wielded

28:56.535 --> 28:58.470
without being unsheathed.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.774
The kampilan's
distinctively-carved wooden hilt

29:01.808 --> 29:04.243
was sometimes embellished
with strands of hair,

29:04.276 --> 29:06.478
offering a unique
and appealing appearance

29:06.512 --> 29:10.116
for this otherwise
deadly weapon.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.084
- What in the world is this?
[laughs]

29:12.118 --> 29:14.320
This is
a completely different sword.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.556
- The blades must include
a spur at the tip.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.893
The handle itself must include
a traditional Y-shape

29:20.927 --> 29:22.194
and a cross guard

29:22.228 --> 29:25.097
that is at least
5 inches long.

29:25.131 --> 29:28.134
At the end of 5 days, you will
return and present your kampilan

29:28.167 --> 29:30.102
to our panel of expert judges,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.138
and only after
they've tested them

29:32.171 --> 29:34.974
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.143
Good luck.
We'll see you in 5 days.

29:37.176 --> 29:42.481
*

29:42.514 --> 29:44.316
- It's like a romantic campfire,

29:44.350 --> 29:46.185
me and the steel.
[laughs]

29:46.218 --> 29:48.420
I'm making a kampilan,

29:48.454 --> 29:50.890
Strangest sword that
I have not heard of.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.159
That's a lot of metal
to thin out.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.095
It's got a weird,
kind of a fork handle,

29:56.128 --> 29:58.530
and it's got a point on the end.
Blade is straight,

29:58.564 --> 30:00.399
and it's got a curve
like a whale.

30:00.432 --> 30:03.569
So it's kind
of a different sword.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.337
Oh.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.506
What do we got going on here?

30:07.539 --> 30:09.375
The power hammer
is giving me trouble.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.914
If this thing dies,

30:14.947 --> 30:18.050
I'm back to the old way
of stretching this thing.

30:18.084 --> 30:20.252
It's gonna be quite a setback
if I lose this thing.

30:20.286 --> 30:23.455
*

30:23.489 --> 30:26.458
- It feels really good to be
home and back in my own forge.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.928
The kampilan is
completely new to me.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.097
Part of this is
a historical recreation,

30:31.130 --> 30:34.333
so it's really important
I make it historically accurate.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.568
All right,
here's my new sword.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.106
*

30:40.139 --> 30:41.440
That's good.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.509
I'm really nervous because

30:43.542 --> 30:45.544
it doesn't take much
for this to get messed up.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.146
I feel I can do it,

30:47.179 --> 30:49.015
but I just have to stay on task.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.316
[exhales]

30:50.349 --> 30:53.085
Looks pretty good.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.421
My goal today was to have
a profiled sword.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.556
That happened, and now
I'm a little further ahead

30:57.589 --> 31:00.426
than I anticipated.
I am beat.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.328
*

31:02.361 --> 31:04.931
- Yesterday,
I had the upsize the motor

31:04.964 --> 31:06.298
on the power hammer...
Okay.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.435
And forged out my piece.

31:09.468 --> 31:12.438
There you go.
That looks like the picture.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.673
Today, I want to make sure

31:14.706 --> 31:17.209
I get that thing all tapered
and narrowed down.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.145
Getting the weight off the blade

31:19.178 --> 31:22.381
and trying to thin that down
is a task in itself.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.683
I hope I have it thin
enough for Doug.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.552
Hopefully it'll satisfy him.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.320
It's getting a lot lighter.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.323
Ready for heat treating.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.459
The quenching's
a real critical thing.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.061
You don't want to hear
that little tink.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.595
You know, that crack sound.

31:36.628 --> 31:43.069
*

31:43.102 --> 31:45.537
Whoo.
Oh, praise the Lord, it's good.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.673
No cracks.
No warps.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.542
It skates.
Yes.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.311
I'm very happy with it.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.146
Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.582
*

31:56.615 --> 31:59.318
- Today, I'm gonna cut the spur
out of the tip of the blade.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.954
All right, here we go.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.123
There's a lot of bad things
that can happen here.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.525
Taking a chisel to any part
of your blade

32:06.558 --> 32:09.728
can result
in unfixable blemishes.

32:09.761 --> 32:14.633
*

32:14.666 --> 32:17.169
I'll take it.
Time for the heat treat.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.605
*

32:19.638 --> 32:22.074
Heat treat's the worst part
of any blade-making process,

32:22.108 --> 32:25.077
so I'm incredibly nervous.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.314
Warping is the number
one concern I have.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.549
When I dunk the blade
into that oil,

32:30.582 --> 32:32.318
it's gonna do
what it's gonna do,

32:32.351 --> 32:34.353
and there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

32:34.386 --> 32:41.393
*

32:41.427 --> 32:44.296
My gut wrenches.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.432
I have a warp.
[bleep].

32:46.465 --> 32:51.103
*

32:51.137 --> 32:54.106
- Warp.
Sucks.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.742
The thinner the steel,
the more tricky it can be

32:56.775 --> 32:59.545
to get the heat treat
to go off without any issues,

32:59.578 --> 33:02.014
but as I look at it, I like it.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.183
It took kind of a scimitar warp.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.318
Adds character.
It doesn't go side to side,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.454
it bows up,
kind of like a katana.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.556
It is the best warp
you can possibly take on.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.691
I will take it.
[exhales]

33:12.724 --> 33:15.727
- Today, I think the plan
is probably eating sawdust.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.763
Gonna work on that handle.

33:17.796 --> 33:21.067
The way it's designed
is a little unusual.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.469
The handle has
that protruding Y

33:23.502 --> 33:25.471
that comes up towards your arm.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.207
It looks like it would be
uncomfortable to yield,

33:28.240 --> 33:31.077
but it's their blade.
I'm just making it.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.444
I'm gonna mark up
the front guard

33:32.478 --> 33:34.446
and cut thatne out.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.748
I'm gonna do the top guard
as one piece

33:36.782 --> 33:38.684
and fit it to the handle.

33:38.717 --> 33:42.054
Does kind of look
like a raptor, kind of.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.455
That's not what I was going for,

33:43.489 --> 33:44.623
but that's what it
turned out to be.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.758
It's a dino-sword.
[laughs]

33:46.792 --> 33:49.228
I'm a little apprehensive
on testing.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.729
If something
crucially goes wrong

33:50.762 --> 33:52.564
I won't have a blade to turn in,

33:52.598 --> 33:55.801
so I'm gonna leave this
to the judges to test.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.669
Very nice.
It looks good.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.405
It's a done deal.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.074
*

34:02.108 --> 34:04.176
- This is my last day.
I feel pretty good.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.345
Just need to grind the tang,
finish up the handle,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.347
and just make stuff pretty
and sharp.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.815
The handle material's
a big block of mahogany.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.550
Mahogany is a traditional wood.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.485
It's tough, it's rot-resistant,

34:13.519 --> 34:16.588
so I don't have too many
concerns about going into this.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.357
Getting this handle put on,

34:18.390 --> 34:21.093
and that is the point
of no return.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.262
My only reservations with
this blade are that it's hefty,

34:23.295 --> 34:24.463
but a lot of my research pointed
to the fact

34:24.496 --> 34:26.098
that this is a heavy sword.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.434
For the royal flair
of this sword,

34:28.467 --> 34:30.736
genuine human hair.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.704
That is something
that was on these handles,

34:32.738 --> 34:35.641
so it's merely
for historical accuracy.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.276
And it's funny.
[chuckles]

34:37.309 --> 34:39.845
Well, it's a kampilan.

34:39.878 --> 34:44.283
*

34:44.316 --> 34:47.219
- Bladesmiths,
welcome back to the Forge.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.188
You've had 5 days
at your home forge

34:49.221 --> 34:51.223
to work on your finale weapons.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.758
Todd, how did it go?

34:52.791 --> 34:55.827
- It was a pleasure.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.563
Used the steel
that was provided,

34:57.596 --> 34:59.898
and I'm glad
I had the power hammer,

34:59.931 --> 35:02.234
and it really went pretty good.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.136
First sword I've made.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.771
- All right, Michael,
how'd it go for you?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.739
- It was an interesting build,

35:07.773 --> 35:10.442
definitely different than swords
I've made in the past,

35:10.476 --> 35:12.344
but I just ran with it.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.845
From my research,
I discovered

35:13.879 --> 35:15.747
that sometimes
hair of their victim

35:15.781 --> 35:17.749
would be placed on the handle,
or animal hair.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.586
- So whose hair is that?
- Somebody from Brazil.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.322
- Well, bladesmiths,
up first

35:23.355 --> 35:25.491
is the sharpness test.
Dave?

35:25.524 --> 35:28.560
*

35:28.594 --> 35:31.363
- All right, gentlemen, to test
the sharpness of your blades,

35:31.397 --> 35:34.600
I'll be chopping through
our cat's cradle of rope here.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.834
Now, Todd, you're up first.
You ready?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.903
- I am.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.706
I'm proud of how my kampilan
turned out.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.774
You try to do everything right,

35:42.808 --> 35:44.643
you don't know
if it's gonna work out that way.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.545
*

35:46.578 --> 35:48.747
Lord, help me.

35:48.780 --> 35:55.687
*

36:01.660 --> 36:03.429
- [exhales]
- All right, Todd.

36:03.462 --> 36:07.499
This blade has all the weight
right here, you know?

36:07.533 --> 36:09.268
You know,
it's a weapon that's designed

36:09.301 --> 36:11.370
to be used one or two-handed,

36:11.403 --> 36:14.440
but controlling
all that forward weight

36:14.473 --> 36:18.310
definitely puts this
as a two-hand-only sword.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.880
It's a good-looking piece,
and it definitely is a cutter.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.549
Michael, you're up.
You ready?

36:23.582 --> 36:25.884
- Let's do it.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.255
I am a little worried.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.523
If Dave thinks
that Todd's sword's heavy,

36:31.557 --> 36:34.793
he's gonna really dislike mine.

36:34.826 --> 36:41.733
*

36:48.674 --> 36:51.243
- Good job.
- Thanks.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.679
- Still a very heavy weapon.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.282
I would have zero confidence
swinging that one-handed,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.350
that it wouldn't
get away from me,

36:58.384 --> 37:02.354
but the weight distribution
on your blade is further back,

37:02.388 --> 37:06.658
which made quite a bit more
control to chop those ropes.

37:06.692 --> 37:10.028
It's definitely a cutter,
so good job.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.897
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.667
*

37:15.701 --> 37:18.904
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.373
I'm gonna take your kampilan
and deliver lethal blows

37:21.407 --> 37:22.808
on this pig carcass.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.276
Todd, you're up first.
You ready?

37:24.310 --> 37:26.612
- I sure am.
- Let's do this.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.580
- My concern on the pig test

37:28.614 --> 37:31.883
is my blade is thicker
in the middle.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.720
I'm hoping mine
will go all the way through,

37:34.753 --> 37:38.357
it won't slow it down
by the thickness.

37:38.390 --> 37:45.331
*

37:54.039 --> 37:55.807
- All right, Todd.
The swing over here

37:55.841 --> 37:57.743
almost cut all the way,

37:57.776 --> 38:00.346
and of course with an easy
swing on the way back,

38:00.379 --> 38:02.848
it cut the pig in half.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.517
Your kampilan will kill.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.919
- Thank you.
- All right, Michael, your turn.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.488
You ready?
- Let's do it.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.790
- Let's do this.
- I'm excited.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.659
I want to see my sword
cut through a pig.

38:13.692 --> 38:20.666
*

38:30.609 --> 38:32.010
- All right, Mike.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.479
So even though it is
a heavier blade,

38:33.512 --> 38:35.347
its counterbalance

38:35.381 --> 38:37.048
allows you to wield

38:37.082 --> 38:39.918
going forward
and backward easily,

38:39.951 --> 38:43.021
so it was an easy recovery
for the final chop.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.492
Overall,
your kampilan will kill.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.627
- Thank you.
- Good job.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.696
- All right, gentlemen.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.964
To test the strength
and durability of your blade,

38:52.998 --> 38:55.867
I'll be chopping
into this green bamboo.

38:55.901 --> 38:59.571
- The strength test is always
the toughest on a blade.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.007
I didn't want
to get it too hard.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.077
I'm nervous because this test
proves you did it right.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.414
If you didn't,
if there's a flaw in it,

39:08.447 --> 39:11.417
it is gonna reveal itself here.

39:11.450 --> 39:16.154
*

39:16.187 --> 39:18.557
- Bamboo, it's hard stuff.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.959
If you didn't harden
your blade right,

39:20.992 --> 39:22.994
if there's a flaw in it,
this will tell it.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.665
I am praying
that my edge holds up.

39:26.698 --> 39:33.639
*

39:42.180 --> 39:44.516
Whoa.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.886
- Yeah, I don't feel any damage
whatsoever on the edge.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.022
It did a job on that bamboo,
and it's clean.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.824
Well done.
- Thank you.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.125
- Michael, you ready?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.894
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.996
- I am still recovering
from the trauma

39:58.029 --> 40:00.699
of watching Dave
use Todd's sword on that bamboo.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.468
This test, I believe,
is the one

40:02.501 --> 40:05.904
that's gonna make
or break my blade.

40:05.937 --> 40:12.911
*

40:24.890 --> 40:26.792
- Well...

40:26.825 --> 40:30.462
*

40:30.496 --> 40:32.063
I thought I saw something,

40:32.097 --> 40:34.866
but it was just bamboo
stuck to your blade.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.636
It's fine.
There's no damage there.

40:37.669 --> 40:41.106
Your blade hasn't
changed shape at all.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.209
Good job.
Well done.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.144
- Going in like this,
seeing we're so close,

40:46.177 --> 40:48.113
now it's up to the judges.

40:48.146 --> 40:51.116
It's their pick,
and so I'm a little nervous.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.184
- All right, bladesmiths,

40:53.218 --> 40:54.953
From the moment you guys
lit those coal forges

40:54.986 --> 40:56.622
until this moment,

40:56.655 --> 40:58.156
you've put in
a lot of hard work.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.058
It's been a lot of stress,

41:00.091 --> 41:01.960
but in this arena
of competition,

41:01.993 --> 41:03.995
there can only be one Forged
in Fire champion,

41:04.029 --> 41:05.697
and that champion is...

41:05.731 --> 41:08.900
*

41:08.934 --> 41:10.769
Michael,
congratulations.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.572
you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.742
Todd, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

41:16.775 --> 41:20.512
- Todd, this is what we judges
expect in the third round,

41:20.546 --> 41:22.848
two beautiful blades
equally matched,

41:22.881 --> 41:25.216
but it comes down
to the finer details.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.186
Your blade isn't
as well-balanced

41:28.219 --> 41:30.255
as that of your opponent's,

41:30.288 --> 41:32.724
and your design and detail
were not as strong.

41:32.758 --> 41:35.694
So for those reasons,
we have to let you go.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.966
- Be proud of your work, Todd,
because it was a close call,

41:40.999 --> 41:43.802
but please
surrender your weapon.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.705
- I never thought
about making it this far.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.708
This was the first sword
I've ever made.

41:49.741 --> 41:52.811
I'm proud of what I did,
and it held up good.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.914
I didn't think that I would
be capable of doing this,

41:55.947 --> 41:58.584
and you never know what kind
of strength you can find.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.786
*

42:00.819 --> 42:02.253
- Michael, congratulations.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.989
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion,

42:04.022 --> 42:05.991
and that's a title
that comes with a check

42:06.024 --> 42:08.293
for $10,000.
Good job, brother.

42:08.326 --> 42:11.196
[applausus

42:11.229 --> 42:13.098
All right, what's going on
inside of there?

42:13.131 --> 42:15.133
- It's surreal.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.302
I wasn't expecting this
starting this competition,

42:17.335 --> 42:19.771
but a huge affirmation
of my skills.

42:19.805 --> 42:23.809
- Please present your weapon
to the judges.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.645
- It's surreal.
It hasn't really set in yet.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.280
All the years that I've put
into this hobby, this craft,

42:29.314 --> 42:31.182
and now to be here

42:31.216 --> 42:32.884
and be the "Forged in Fire"
champion,

42:32.918 --> 42:34.886
it's pretty amazing.

42:34.920 --> 42:39.858
*
