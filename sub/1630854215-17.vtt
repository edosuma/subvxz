00:04.088 --> 00:08.384
I made you blueberry pancakes.
Would you prefer cauliflower?

00:08.384 --> 00:12.346
No, Shaun. That's our baby. I'm 36 weeks.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.099
The baby is the size
of a head of cauliflower.

00:15.099 --> 00:18.561
Our baby will not be this bumpy.

00:21.105 --> 00:25.526
I am very... happy.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.736
Me too.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.946
We're having a baby,

00:28.946 --> 00:31.532
I have an amazing job,
you're an attending.

00:31.824 --> 00:35.327
We have a new family car.
Dr. Glassman has moved down the hall.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.038
Jared is coming back to work
at the hospital.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.040
It is great that he's back.

00:40.916 --> 00:45.045
But, you know, the dynamic
might be a little different.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.590
Research has shown
that when working with friends,

00:47.590 --> 00:50.551
you get more done in less time
and have fun on the job.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.304
But Jared will be working for you,
not with you.

00:53.304 --> 00:56.015
It can be different
when you have to manage a friend.

00:56.015 --> 00:59.101
Lines can get blurred,
and that can be hard.

01:00.603 --> 01:03.355
The lines are not blurred.
They are very clear.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.947
Hey there, lover boy. Give me the details.

01:12.114 --> 01:15.534
Are you and Jerome exchanging keys
or getting a new place together?

01:15.534 --> 01:19.038
- He did not ask me to move in.
- What did he want to talk to you about?

01:19.371 --> 01:21.165
I don't want to talk about it.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.628
Now I wanna know even more,
and my interrogation will continue until--

01:27.546 --> 01:29.340
You going to the club or work?

01:32.301 --> 01:34.887
These early calls
need some getting used to.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.056
Kendrick is the perfect pick-me-up.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.433
- Never mad at Kendrick.
- Yes.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.521
- Nice shirt. Tom Ford?
- Yeah, my good luck charm.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.815
Figured it couldn't hurt
on my first day back.

01:45.815 --> 01:49.151
For $700 it should give you
more than luck.

01:50.778 --> 01:54.198
On occasion it has. See you guys in there.

01:57.827 --> 02:01.288
The car is a bit much
but the fashion is lit.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.583
Now, Mr. Grumpy, what's going on with you?

02:04.583 --> 02:05.543
Goodbye.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.880
Dr. Kalu is not your peer,
not your friend.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.007
He is your employee and you are his boss.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.343
I am confident
that Jared will do a good job.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.221
That's what I mean.
He's not "Jared," he's "Dr. Kalu."

02:17.221 --> 02:19.765
I do not always call people
by their titles.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.934
- Sometimes I call Dr. Allen--
- Dr. Murphy.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.812
An informal communication style
with Dr. Kalu

02:24.812 --> 02:27.314
could create a perception
of special treatment.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.401
I do not plan
to give Jared special treatment.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.320
That doesn't mean
Dr. Kalu isn't expecting it.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.533
And if I see it,
it won't be good for either of you.

02:42.037 --> 02:45.708
She has bruising and pain
even with passive range of motion.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.961
Some bullies at school chased her.
She fell down the stairs.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.421
That's not how it happened.

02:50.629 --> 02:54.383
We should've stuck with home-schooling.
She insisted. Look what happened.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.218
You need to be still.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.805
Your shoulder is fractured.
Ultrasound the patient.

03:06.270 --> 03:09.648
- Why are you laughing?
- She can't help it.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.401
Yara has Tourette's.
It's why she had the fight--

03:12.401 --> 03:16.906
Mom, he was asking me.
You never let me speak for myself.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.658
It wasn't a fight.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.120
Some kids thought it would be funny
to point and stare at me.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.331
Thought it'd be funny
to egg their lockers.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.334
Then my stupid tics messed up my getaway.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.502
There's significant tissue swelling

03:30.502 --> 03:32.796
and massive hematoma
at the proximal humerus.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.176
The fracture has caused
an acute compartment syndrome.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.928
You need surgery right away.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.403
What were you doing
when you started getting dizzy?

03:56.528 --> 04:00.074
I was sitting in gym class
and then the room started to spin.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.202
And then I threw up.
But I wasn't doing it.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.164
I just introduced Carter
to the <i>Wonder Woman</i> comics.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.627
- He's been trying to learn the twirl.
- I don't blame you. The twirl is awesome.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.339
- Where's my little guy?
- Hey, Mama E.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.549
Hey, Carter G.

04:18.926 --> 04:23.180
- You should have called me immediately.
- Elaine's my mom.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.809
I don't need your permission
to bring him here.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.812
Actually, you do. I'm his legal guardian.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.817
- What's wrong with him?
- His heart rate is quite low.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.110
What does that mean?

04:36.110 --> 04:39.947
Carter has an abnormality of electrical
signals controlling his heartbeat.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.909
We need to run some tests.
Echo and electrophysiology study.

04:54.003 --> 04:58.549
- The prodigal resident returns.
- Lovely to see you as well, Dr. Reznick.

04:59.008 --> 05:02.261
Will the hospital be getting a new wing
in the Kalu family name?

05:02.261 --> 05:04.304
My family are doing well, thanks.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.767
And I was recruited to return
based on my training,

05:08.767 --> 05:12.980
breadth of experience and willingness
to take a demotion back to a first-year.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.858
It's gonna be hellish
being bossed around by newbies

05:15.858 --> 05:19.903
and people who used to be your peers.
Grab me that box on the top shelf.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.488
I missed you too.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.868
While I was away,
I learned how to read emotional energy.

05:26.744 --> 05:29.371
And snapping at people
is your love language.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.750
Happy to know you still care.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.047
- Good luck, newbie.
- Thanks.

05:39.048 --> 05:43.010
I've got to get to surgery. Enjoy.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.270
Your control of the shaft segment
is very precise.

05:54.063 --> 05:54.980
Thank you.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.900
Brown retractor.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.070
No brown retractor.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.198
I thought I put it on your tray.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.950
My tools
must be individually selected, sterilized

06:06.950 --> 06:10.871
and placed in my tray
before I begin the surgery.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.581
Understood. Got it.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.795
That will do.
Further expose the proximal humerus.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.091
Place sutures in rotator cuff
to mobilize humeral head.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.637
Sorry for dropping the ball
with your tools. Rookie mistake.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.848
Don't sweat it.
You're BFFs with the boss, right?

06:31.141 --> 06:34.436
I treat every resident the same.

06:34.436 --> 06:39.608
Dr. Allen, place Steinmann pins
proximal to biceps tendon.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.069
Dr. Kalu, you are on suction.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.122
Catheter placed in axillary vein.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.041
I feel bad for Carter's mom.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.335
I can't imagine trying to raise a kid

06:58.335 --> 07:01.088
with my mother backseat-driving
my every move.

07:01.255 --> 07:05.217
Well, maybe if Bianca told Elaine
she was taking Carter to the hospital,

07:05.217 --> 07:06.802
she would trust her more.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.262
Pacing wire.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.473
Bianca was probably doing
what she thought was best.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
Withholding information
is never for the best.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.731
Advancing to the right ventricle.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.193
- Everything okay between you two?
- We're fine.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.242
That can't be right.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.287
I need contrast to clear up
what I'm seeing on fluoroscopy.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.960
L-transposition of the great arteries.

07:40.544 --> 07:44.590
The ventricles are... inverted.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.759
His heart is... backward.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.062
Your surgery went well.

07:59.062 --> 08:02.149
We decompressed and released
your compartment syndrome

08:02.149 --> 08:04.067
and stabilize your humerus fracture.

08:04.234 --> 08:08.322
- Great. When can I go back to school?
- A few days. Be sure to wear your sling.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.034
- You're not going back to school.
- Why not?

08:12.034 --> 08:14.995
It's not safe. I'm not sending
you back so they can hurt you.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.664
I'm not a baby. I can take care of myself.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.374
I need to take your vitals.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.211
If you could,
we wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.

08:22.211 --> 08:25.422
Going to school is literally
the only thing I do that's normal.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.715
I don't want to be--

08:29.009 --> 08:33.096
I don't want to be stuck at home with you.
You never let me do anything by--

08:34.056 --> 08:37.309
- Yara.
- She's having a seizure.

08:37.309 --> 08:40.312
We need two milligrams of lorazepam
and MRI, stat!

08:57.246 --> 08:58.872
She's sleeping like a baby.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.711
You should've used propofol
instead of Versed to sedate her.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.382
Versed is old-school.
Same effects, none of the overshooting.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.553
- Why are you changing my settings?
- Peds case.

09:13.929 --> 09:17.224
Shorter duration imaging sequences
cuts the time in half.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.936
It's your first day, remember?

09:20.936 --> 09:24.648
You could probably use a refresher
before trying a shortcut.

09:24.648 --> 09:28.110
I'm a little out of practice,
but I got a few tricks up my sleeve.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.364
- Says the guy who has to repeat a year.
- Ow.

09:35.117 --> 09:39.246
Shaun will appreciate getting
Yara's results back faster. Trust me.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.083
You know him better than me.

09:47.004 --> 09:51.216
Was the patient properly sedated
before you began this MRI?

09:51.216 --> 09:54.261
Yeah. I used the standard
pediatric protocol with Versed.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.390
Did Dr. Allen tell you
about our revised propofol protocol?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.394
Yeah. But in my experience
Versed provides better--

10:02.394 --> 10:06.273
- You should've listened to Dr. Allen.
- I know how to perform an MRI, Shaun.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.192
You apparently do not.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.988
There is too much motion degradation.
These images are unusable.

10:13.572 --> 10:18.577
Dr. Allen, please go redo the MRI.
Dr. Kalu, we need to speak privately.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.258
You cannot take shortcuts.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.304
You're right. Sorry.

10:38.013 --> 10:42.809
You cannot expect special treatment
because you are my friend.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.772
I'm not expecting
special treatment, Shaun.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.359
But I don't appreciate
being treated like an intern either.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.946
Technically, I'm a first-year, but I've
been a doctor for as long as you have.

10:54.946 --> 10:59.076
We are not peers. I am your boss
and you have a lot to learn.

10:59.076 --> 11:02.662
Dr. Andrews said he is judging
my performance off of your performance,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.039
and it is not good.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.001
Okay?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.963
- Okay.
- Good.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.299
You need to go practice basic skills

11:14.299 --> 11:16.843
and observe our current
standardized MRI process.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.565
Heart block plus inverted cardiac anatomy.
What's your plan?

11:30.565 --> 11:34.277
Intravenous pacemaker is out.
We could place it surgically.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.446
Doesn't address the anatomy issue.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.949
It could lead to heart failure
as he gets older.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.243
It could.
He might be fine with the pacemaker.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.829
If he's developed arrhythmia,
not a great sign.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.290
I'd recommend
the double switch reconstruction.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.501
Redirect blood flow
to the right ventricle.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.712
- I have Carter's BMP and cardiac labs.
- I received them digitally.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.634
But the hard copies
are always appreciated.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.055
- Trouble in paradise?
- Everything's fine.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.182
They're in this passive-aggressive fight.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.185
- We're not fighting.
- That would require you talking to me.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.148
You don't have to share.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.066
But you do have two divorcees

12:13.066 --> 12:16.194
with a sadly ample amount
of experience between us.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.488
Was one of you in contact with an ex?

12:18.488 --> 12:20.824
Took an out-of-state job
without including you?

12:25.203 --> 12:27.456
Jerome lied to me
about something important.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.624
- I didn't.
- Omission is still a lie.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.501
- Not that simple.
- Should've told me.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.794
- I wanted to.
- You didn't.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.504
I was afraid of how you'd react.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.967
But you're right.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.970
It never should have been a secret.
There's nothing to hide.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.722
I'm HIV positive.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.852
Thanks to my meds, my viral load
has been undetectable for years.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.855
I'm poz undetectable.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.025
I can't transmit the virus.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.743
You should go talk to him.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.829
I have work to do.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.750
Present the double switch surgery
to the family.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.085
- If they agree, I'll scrub in.
- On it.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.386
No. How did we get from a pacemaker
to reconstructing his heart?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.013
The procedure may sound drastic,

13:25.013 --> 13:27.933
but it will reduce his risk
of developing heart failure.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.684
Can't we give him the pacemaker

13:29.684 --> 13:31.978
and do the surgery
if the problem gets worse?

13:31.978 --> 13:35.982
When he shows signs of heart failure,
it'll be too late for the reconstruction.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.153
- We should fix it now.
- This isn't your decision.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.367
You're still making me pay for mistakes
I made when I was 17?

13:45.367 --> 13:49.996
- And eighteen, nineteen, twenty--
- I've been back for two years.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.999
How can I be a mother
when you won't give me a chance?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.878
Mama? Mama E? I don't feel good.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.301
- It's okay, baby. I'm here.
- Honey, what's wrong?

14:03.301 --> 14:08.181
- My chest hurts.
- Heart rate is 40bpm. BP 73/45.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.476
We need a decision soon
before his condition deteriorates.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.572
I wanted to apologize for earlier.
It was unprofessional.

14:28.159 --> 14:32.414
You have nothing to apologize for...
and no duty to disclose.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.208
Undetectable equals untransmittable.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.253
I appreciate you saying that.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.466
- Give Asher some time.
- He's a doctor.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.554
He knows there was never any risk to him.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.891
What people know
and how it makes them feel

14:51.891 --> 14:54.102
are often two very different things.

14:56.938 --> 15:01.109
You've had years to process your status.
Allow Asher to process it too.

15:06.364 --> 15:11.369
- Please do not say "I told you so."
- I won't. But I'm gonna think it.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.414
You seem a little spoiled.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.584
You don't know me.

15:20.378 --> 15:24.633
You come from money and you
haven't had to work hard for anything.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.218
You made it through med school.
Bravo to that.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.012
You got kicked out of this program,

15:29.012 --> 15:32.223
but landed on your feet
taking care of a billionaire.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.477
And when you got tired of that,
you were welcomed back here.

15:35.685 --> 15:39.522
You come in with your fancy car
and your old tricks

15:39.522 --> 15:43.443
and think, "Ta-da. I'm a surgeon."
But you're not. Yet.

15:44.569 --> 15:48.782
You're the new kid.
Shaun is the boss and I have seniority.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.828
You should've listened to Kendrick.
Be humble.

16:03.672 --> 16:08.093
I just want to prove that I belong here...
to Shaun, to everyone.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.264
- But you're right.
- I know.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.399
The image is still not
high enough resolution.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.568
Have you finished redoing the imaging?

16:25.568 --> 16:29.531
Yes, and I followed all the protocols,
but the image still doesn't look clear.

16:32.909 --> 16:37.997
The image is clear...
but Yara's diagnosis was incorrect.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.585
She does not have Tourette's.
She has a brain tumor.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.683
I don't have Tourette's?

16:56.683 --> 17:00.478
No. You have a hypothalamic hamartoma.
Your tics aren't tics.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.523
They are gelastic seizures
caused by the tumor in your brain.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.485
- Tumor? Does that mean cancer?
- The tumor is not cancerous.

17:07.485 --> 17:11.823
But a Gamma Knife radiosurgery should stop
it from growing and treat the seizures.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.579
Will it stop this?

17:19.164 --> 17:23.251
- Not immediately.
- And possibly not at all.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.881
There are other options you can consider
if you don't see improvement.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.345
Or we could consider them now.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.602
A successful resection
could stop the seizures immediately.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.564
- That procedure is risky.
- But that means I can go back to school.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.817
I could learn how to drive,
take care of myself.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.779
Mommy, please. I just want to be normal.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.073
Tumor resection can cause stroke,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.534
partial paralysis,
learning deficits, meningitis.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.038
The Gamma Knife is much safer.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.085
- Yara, I'm sorry. I can't--
- You can.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.880
You just won't let me.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.677
Please go ahead
and schedule the Gamma Knife procedure.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.399
Have you made a decision?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.654
I'm afraid of exposing Carter
to more trauma.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.325
- What trauma?
- He was left by his mother.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.035
I left him with you.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.330
And expected me to pick up the pieces,
fix everything.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.333
I knew he was safer with you than with me.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.835
But I didn't know that.

18:47.418 --> 18:51.631
I gave you too much freedom, wasn't
involved enough. Look what happened.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.009
My mistakes were mine, not yours.

18:58.346 --> 19:02.433
I was supposed to protect you.
And we lost you.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.019
I have to do better for Carter.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.983
The surgery is what's best for Carter,
long-term.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.821
That kid is my heart.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.953
I'm gonna trust you to fix his.

19:31.087 --> 19:35.091
- Lunchtime. I'm starved.
- I am not hungry.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.136
It's not good to deprive
your pregnant wife her lunch.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.763
I thought it'd be fun
working with a friend.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.682
It is not fun. It is difficult.

19:43.266 --> 19:47.353
I do not want people to think
I am giving Dr. Kalu special treatment,

19:47.353 --> 19:48.438
because I am not.

19:48.438 --> 19:52.442
In fact, I am being very firm
because he has already made several errors

19:52.442 --> 19:54.235
and I do not understand why.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.489
He's a new resident on his first day.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.909
There has to be a bit of a learning curve.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.995
He is not acting like a new resident.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.665
Well, he's your friend,
and he knows you expect a lot of him.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.837
No one can follow the rules
if they don't know what they are.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.270
Atrial septum excised.
Starting venous reconstruction.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.483
May not be enough tissue for redirection
of flow to the tricuspid valve.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.361
We can use pericardium
to create a baffle. Metz.

20:39.656 --> 20:43.242
- You make up with Jerome yet?
- He betrayed my trust.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.957
Securing edge to atrial septum.

20:49.123 --> 20:53.211
- You've never hidden anything from him?
- I'd never hide something like this.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.422
Congratulations.
You win the virtue contest.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.217
Possible prizes include
the end of your relationship.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.346
Or you could just talk it out.
Dividing the aorta.

21:04.555 --> 21:08.685
He's the one who changed things.
Why is it on me to figure that out?

21:09.102 --> 21:12.730
The question is, do you love
Jerome enough to change with him?

21:12.730 --> 21:14.941
Suturing distal aorta to pulmonary valve.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.861
Coronary arteries are patent.
Anastomosis looks great.

21:23.032 --> 21:26.327
I never met a teenager who wanted
to go to school as much as you.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.581
I hate school.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.003
But I hate not being able to control
anything in my life even more.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.296
Egging those lockers
made you feel in control?

21:37.797 --> 21:41.592
Kinda. Those bullies messed with me,
I messed with them back.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.885
Like normal kids do.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.310
I was bullied a lot in high school.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.399
I was scrawny, with braces, a lisp.
Basically a target on my back.

21:57.191 --> 22:01.738
But my mum helped me. Gave me her credit
card to buy them off with pizza and candy.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.157
My mom is too helpful.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.077
She won't even let me make my own PB

22:10.621 --> 22:13.332
She thinks I'll tic out
and hurt myself with the knife.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.295
When my body isn't controlling me, she is.

22:19.422 --> 22:23.009
When you said you can cut this tumor
out of my head, for 30 seconds,

22:23.760 --> 22:26.971
I could imagine only laughing
when something was funny.

22:46.032 --> 22:49.827
- I think I found a solution.
- I have found a solution as well.

22:51.037 --> 22:55.208
I have made a list of boundaries and rules
to make our working relationship better.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.836
You need to study them.
What have you found a solution for?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.632
I think I found
a better resection technique.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.635
Has a lower risk profile,
closer to that of a Gamma Knife.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.012
And offers a better outcome for Yara.

23:08.012 --> 23:12.892
I presented the safest option
to the patient, which she agreed to.

23:13.101 --> 23:17.522
And you should not have presented
the tumor resection without consulting me.

23:17.522 --> 23:20.817
That is an important boundary.
Number two on the list.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.446
I thought you'd be happy
I was thinking like you.

23:25.446 --> 23:29.033
- You're not me. You're here to learn.
- I'm here to help people like Yara.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.328
You need to respect I'm your attending.
Number six on the list.

23:32.328 --> 23:35.039
Don't have to be an attending
to know she's depressed.

23:35.039 --> 23:38.543
We cannot make medical decisions
based off of the patient's emotions.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.337
Sometimes the emotions
are just as important as medical.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.631
You are making my job very hard.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.343
Number ten,

23:48.553 --> 23:52.390
at work, follow my instructions precisely.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.727
If you cannot comply,
you will be out of the program.

24:24.714 --> 24:25.840
I really messed up.

24:26.799 --> 24:30.094
I should have trusted you,
been upfront about everything.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.512
Yeah, you should have.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.685
After my diagnosis, it took a long time
for me to feel comfortable dating,

24:37.685 --> 24:39.145
or being around people.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.064
I spent so much time alone.

24:42.064 --> 24:45.526
And when I put myself back out there,
there was a lot of rejection.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.779
Guys just didn't want
to deal with my status.

24:51.115 --> 24:57.663
So when this adorable, brilliant doctor
popped into my life...

24:59.916 --> 25:01.626
and I liked him so much...

25:03.669 --> 25:06.005
I was too scared to tell him the truth.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.841
I'm sorry.

25:13.763 --> 25:17.099
- This doctor sounds pretty great.
- He is.

25:22.688 --> 25:26.442
I made sure we always used protection,
encouraged you to stay on PrEP.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.736
All to make sure that you were safe.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.032
That was a decision
that you made for the both of us.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.870
You did those things
to make yourself feel better,

25:38.579 --> 25:40.790
while you took away my choice.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.129
How could you have known me and loved me

25:47.129 --> 25:50.299
and think that this is something
I couldn't accept?

25:50.299 --> 25:56.013
When I first had to make this decision,
I didn't love you. I barely knew you.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.557
And I'm not sure I know you now.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.523
I made a mistake.
That doesn't change who I am.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.985
No, but maybe it changes how I feel.

26:13.656 --> 26:16.033
I'm sorry that I put you through this,

26:16.909 --> 26:20.288
but I'm still the one living
with this disease, and it's not easy.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.837
It's Carter. I have to go.

26:37.888 --> 26:41.350
He woke up and was laughing
about his comic book, then he turned blue.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.937
Oxygen saturation at 80%.120 bpm.
Blood pressure's dropping.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.941
Administering oxygen
and 250cc normal saline bolus.

26:49.066 --> 26:52.153
Why can't he breathe? The surgery
was supposed to prevent this.

26:52.153 --> 26:55.364
Normal lead impedance.
The pacemaker is functioning properly.

26:55.364 --> 26:58.409
Something else is going on.
We need a cardiac echo, stat.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.212
A kink in Carter's reconstructed atria
caused a clot in his heart.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.592
He's stable. But he needs
another operation to remove the clot

27:14.592 --> 27:16.052
and repair the conduit.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.928
Are there other alternatives?

27:17.928 --> 27:21.140
We could use a catheter
to dissolve the blockage with medication.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.934
But that still leaves the risk
of a clot forming again.

27:23.934 --> 27:28.981
- I knew doing this was the wrong decision.
- We both want what's best for Carter.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.985
- I'm the one responsible for him.
- And I'm sorry I put that on you.

27:35.196 --> 27:39.116
I will never forgive myself for losing out
on those years of Carter's life,

27:39.116 --> 27:44.330
but I've realized that I need to try
to let go of that, let go of my regret,

27:44.330 --> 27:45.956
and focus on what I know.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.336
That leaving him with you
was the best decision for him.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.130
That will never change.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.428
And this surgery
is the right decision for him too.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.273
You're his mother.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.697
You know what's best for Carter.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.622
I want my son to have the surgery.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.139
- You were right.
- I usually am.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.935
What was I right about, exactly?

28:48.978 --> 28:50.813
I came out of the gate too hot,

28:51.897 --> 28:54.942
annoyed Shaun, screwed things up for Yara.

28:56.527 --> 28:57.528
Agree.

28:59.196 --> 29:03.325
- I gotta figure out my next move.
- Listen.

29:10.166 --> 29:14.712
This whole case,
you've been pitching and shortcutting

29:14.712 --> 29:17.756
and trying to be Mr. Fix-it
for everything.

29:18.549 --> 29:22.178
Stop flexing... and listen.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.276
Mom, let me try
the tumor resection surgery. Please.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.652
I'm sorry. No.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.325
- We're ready for you.
- All right, baby.

29:47.578 --> 29:51.707
But first... I want you to tell
your mum what you told me.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.212
About what you're dealing with,
what the surgery means to you.

29:56.212 --> 30:00.299
- I know. I see it every day.
- Have you listened to how it feels to her?

30:02.718 --> 30:05.513
- She doesn't care.
- Of course I do.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.098
You just want to boss me around.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.186
I'm just trying to help,

30:12.186 --> 30:15.397
but no matter what I do,
you're always so angry at me.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.482
I'm angry--

30:19.860 --> 30:21.320
I'm angry at everything.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.449
I'm angry at my body
for not doing what I want it to do.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.285
I'm angry at other kids for being jerks.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.287
And I'm angry at you...

30:31.247 --> 30:35.292
for acting like the only way for me
to survive is where you're protecting me.

30:35.709 --> 30:40.297
I feel like I'm a puppet, and somebody
else is constantly pulling the strings,

30:40.297 --> 30:41.882
yanking me all around.

30:42.591 --> 30:46.637
Getting this tumor removed
is the only way for me to cut the strings.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.522
Don't take her yet.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.317
We need to talk.

31:17.793 --> 31:21.213
I need you to scrub in
on a hypothalamic hamartoma surgery.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.172
Okay.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.425
I had planned to use
Gamma Knife radiation,

31:24.425 --> 31:28.470
but Dr. Kalu violated rule number two
and we have to do his tumor resection.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.432
You're upset with Jared
'cause he changed your plan?

31:31.432 --> 31:35.477
He overstepped with me
and the patient and her mother.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.856
Tumor resection
seems like a pretty good idea.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.442
Are you planning on
letting Jared scrub in?

31:41.734 --> 31:45.446
- Yes. He will be on suction.
- That's an insult.

31:45.988 --> 31:50.784
He has to learn to follow rules.
He has made my job very difficult.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.202
Shaun, sit down.

31:57.291 --> 32:01.420
When you were a resident,
you did things completely your own way.

32:01.962 --> 32:05.382
You still do.
You rubbed everybody the wrong way.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.260
You made everybody's job more difficult,
especially mine.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.678
You were a pain in the ass.

32:10.888 --> 32:14.767
But we gave you the space to learn,
and we learned from you.

32:15.142 --> 32:19.021
And you turned yourself into an asset.
Give Jared the same opportunity.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.522
Okay, he overstepped.

32:20.522 --> 32:25.319
Give him a chance to learn
and to prove himself to be an asset.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.530
Even if you think he's a pain in the ass.

32:31.325 --> 32:34.703
- I will take it into consideration.
- Okay.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.707
Please scrub in for that surgery.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.516
Advance the catheter and endoscope
gently into the ventricle.

32:57.393 --> 33:01.105
Suction and irrigate more aggressively
so she can see what she is doing.

33:03.732 --> 33:08.487
Proceed along the midline posteroinferior
floor of the third ventricle.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.575
- There's the tumor. We can begin excision.
- Bipolar scissors.

33:19.707 --> 33:20.833
Forceps.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.810
- I'll take the specimen to pathology.
- No.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.106
You are going to close.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.692
You sure?

33:50.529 --> 33:53.282
This was your surgical plan.

33:54.742 --> 33:58.412
You will become a better surgeon
by getting a fair shot to be an asset.

33:58.912 --> 34:02.040
I will take the specimen.
Dr. Glassman will supervise.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.514
I'm hungry.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.435
That's a very good sign.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.730
I'll run to the cafe and grab him
some food. Any restrictions?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.357
He can have as many chicken nuggets
as he wants.

34:27.524 --> 34:30.611
I'll go down.
I'll get something for you to eat too.

34:30.611 --> 34:33.238
You haven't left his side
since we got here.

34:34.281 --> 34:37.868
- Comes with being a good mom.
- I had a great teacher.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.079
You know, a little birdie told me

34:41.079 --> 34:45.459
that the giftshop just got in
the latest volume of <i>Wonder Woman.</i>

34:46.084 --> 34:50.339
- Really? Can we get it?
- If your mom is okay with it.

34:51.131 --> 34:55.344
- Of course.
- But no twirling just yet. Okay?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.854
Dr. Murphy was able
to remove all of the tumor.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.985
- Yara?
- Dr. Kalu?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.113
Memory is intact.

35:24.081 --> 35:27.751
The light didn't provoke a seizure.
And your tics are gone.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.840
- Thank you, Dr. Kalu.
- Thank you, Yara.

35:54.069 --> 35:54.987
Dr. Andrews.

35:56.613 --> 35:59.950
Heard about your work on the Fields case.
Good job.

36:00.325 --> 36:04.162
Thank you.
I just came in to ask you for a favor.

36:06.123 --> 36:10.919
- Please judge me for my work, not Shaun.
- Shaun is part of the reason you're here.

36:10.919 --> 36:14.339
I appreciate him for that.
But I want to stand on my own.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.926
If I sink, I don't want
to take my friend with me.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.221
I'm ready to prove myself
as an asset to this hospital.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.934
- I'll be watching.
- Thank you.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.381
I'm sorry for being such a jerk.

37:01.762 --> 37:04.765
You opened yourself up and I shut down.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.938
I should've trusted you,
that we could figure this out together.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.315
Yesterday you said you didn't know me.

37:13.315 --> 37:16.234
That adorable doctor
can be an ass sometimes.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.460
I've never been in love before you.

37:42.052 --> 37:45.097
When I was 16,
I'm pretty sure I ran over a raccoon,

37:45.097 --> 37:48.892
but I didn't stop to check because I was
running late to a baseball game.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.311
Also...

37:53.689 --> 37:57.901
I love a pumpkin spice latte,
even though I know it's basic.

38:00.362 --> 38:02.656
The cufflinks I wore
to Shaun and Lea's wedding--

38:02.656 --> 38:03.615
Yeah.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.495
I bought them for you
but liked them so much I kept them for me.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.083
That explains so much.

38:13.083 --> 38:17.254
But you can totally borrow them sometime.
Probably not.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.510
I love you.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.098
I need you to believe that.

38:53.707 --> 38:57.586
Just came to say good night.
And thank you.

38:59.212 --> 39:01.256
Why are you thanking me?

39:02.799 --> 39:06.136
For not going easy on me.
I was wrong to expect that.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.846
Even if we are friends.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.893
You are a good doctor.

39:15.020 --> 39:19.691
And I would like to continue
to be your friend and your boss...

39:20.650 --> 39:21.818
with boundaries.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.447
You're right. And I'm studying your list.

39:25.906 --> 39:29.076
There is one rule that is not on the list.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.624
It is a rule for me.

39:40.295 --> 39:45.759
I will refer to you... as Dr. Kalu

39:46.426 --> 39:50.764
when I am being your boss
and as Jared when we are in friend mode.

39:52.641 --> 39:56.353
- Yeah. Works for me, Shaun.
- Good.

39:57.104 --> 40:01.483
Jared, I would like to take you out
for drinks to celebrate you being back.

40:01.483 --> 40:04.778
But, Dr. Kalu,
when I checked on Yara post-operatively,

40:04.778 --> 40:07.989
I noticed you only used eight sutures
and she had a small bleed.

40:07.989 --> 40:11.827
You should have used ten. You need
to go work on your suturing technique.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.329
Happy to practice.

40:15.831 --> 40:21.419
But I only replaced the small bone flap.
Dr. Glassman closed the galea and skin.

40:23.380 --> 40:27.425
Dr. Glassman skipped two sutures?

40:29.636 --> 40:30.637
Guess so.

40:32.722 --> 40:35.809
- Meet you for drinks in an hour?
- Okay.
