WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.635 --> 00:02.536
- I'm really sorry
to hear about your friend.

00:03.871 --> 00:04.971
- My dad was supposed
to come here today.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.541
I'm glad you're here instead.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.742
- Is that James Whitaker?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.611
- He's the captain
of the 31st, right?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.812
- There's a big card game.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.447
All the powerful brothers
in the city are there.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.615
- This is Kevin Atwater.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.051
Thought we could use
some new blood.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.786
- The other night
was a onetime deal.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.020
- Everybody knows.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.255
So why are we
still trying to hide it?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.659
- I need a place to crash.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.694
Just for a few days.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.496
- Oh, uh--
- Hi.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.863
- Hi.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.703
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.939
Sorry we're, like,
invading your apartment.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.074
- Oh, it's not
my apartment.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.010
I mean, I sleep here
most nights, but...

00:43.010 --> 00:44.578
- Well, you guys
are engaged, right?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.880
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, you're not Mennonites.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.749
You should be living together.
- Okay, no offense,

00:48.749 --> 00:53.421
but I don't need relationship
advice from a 16-year-old.

00:53.421 --> 00:56.890
- Hey, Al,
how long are you and Michelle

00:56.890 --> 00:58.426
planning on staying?

00:58.426 --> 01:04.197
We love having you but just
trying to get a timeframe.

01:04.197 --> 01:09.603
- Do you have
the business section?

01:09.603 --> 01:11.839
- How well do you know this guy?
- He's a solid dude.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.007
You'll see.

01:14.007 --> 01:17.145
Dominic,
meet Detective Jay Halstead.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.680
- How's it going?
- Works with me in Intelligence.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.382
- How you doing?

01:21.382 --> 01:22.983
Thought you said this was gonna
be just me and you,

01:22.983 --> 01:26.520
but, uh, I guess that's okay.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.389
So, uh,
how's Intelligence work this?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.924
- You bring us a tip.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.727
We sign you up as a reliable
confidential informant,

01:33.727 --> 01:34.862
and you only work
for Intelligence.

01:34.862 --> 01:35.996
- Yeah, I can't be on paper.

01:37.665 --> 01:38.932
- Well, if your name's
not on paper

01:38.932 --> 01:40.734
then we can't get you paid
as a CI.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.303
- I'm not doing it
for the money.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.804
I'm doing it
for the greater good.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.339
- All right,
I'm not in Vice anymore.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.641
I can make you
a John Doe informant.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.977
- No, I can't do that either.
Look, I've been promoted, okay?

01:49.977 --> 01:52.613
We got to play
by NSA rules here, okay?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.182
This tip doesn't exist.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.616
This conversation
never happened.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.452
- All right, well,
what's the tip?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.020
- Narcotics.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.655
I overheard
a flagged call.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.890
Said they were moving
heavy weight.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.560
- It's a phone number
and a license plate.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.996
So how do you know
the phone's dirty?

02:08.996 --> 02:11.332
- NSA listens to everything.
They record everything.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.933
- Yeah, but, come on.
Narcotics chatter?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.202
- Everything.

02:14.202 --> 02:17.371
Certain phrases
on the phone raise red flags.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.607
I analyze that data.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.609
If it's not terrorism,
it's not federal,

02:21.609 --> 02:24.512
special ops can drop it
down to you guys.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.347
That phone
raised a red flag.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.283
I overheard
the license plate.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.118
Follow that number.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.754
You'll be pulling down
multiple kilos.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.457
- Appreciate this, Dom.
- You owe me one.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.799
- We got eyes on this guy yet?

02:45.799 --> 02:48.502
- Not yet, Sarge, but the cell
phone's within 20 meters

02:48.502 --> 02:50.738
so it's got to be
on this block.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.106
- I got him.

02:53.106 --> 02:57.811
Brown jacket,
white sneakers--

02:57.811 --> 02:59.980
I don't got
a lot of room to work.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.486
- All right, we got
our drug runner.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.256
Now where's our target vehicle?

03:08.256 --> 03:11.292
- Nothing yet.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.397
- Thanks.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:33.381 --> 03:34.382
- Do you see it?

03:34.382 --> 03:35.849
- Yeah, I see it.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.618
Black sedan.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.387
Keys in the wheel well?

03:39.387 --> 03:40.788
Where am I going, then?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.323
- I'll text the address
when you're moving.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.772
- Yeah, that's a negative match
on the license plate,

03:58.772 --> 04:01.309
but the target
is moving south on Pulaski.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.781
- Yeah, looks like
they're gonna do a car switch.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.064
- We got a positive ID
on that plate we got a tip to.

04:24.064 --> 04:28.235
It's on a tan pickup,
and he's in motion.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.244
He's making a right
on second street.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.147
- I've got the eye.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.016
Offender is eastbound
in the target vehicle.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.618
Get set up for takeaways.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.391
[police sirens wailing]

05:03.371 --> 05:04.472
- Morning.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.207
License and registration,
please.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.377
- What's the problem, officer?

05:09.377 --> 05:11.845
- You got a brake light
that's flickering.

05:11.845 --> 05:15.282
License and registration.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.984
- Right, it's got
to be in here somewhere.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.204
- Sir, sir, get back
in your car.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.406
Gun!

05:38.406 --> 05:41.442
[gunshots]

05:57.090 --> 05:58.792
- Holy...

05:58.792 --> 06:00.193
- We got kilos?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.429
- Nope, we got a body.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.668
- What?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.839
- Took his hand off.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.511
- Driver's phone.
Couple of numbers saved.

06:27.488 --> 06:27.621
.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.457
- The driver of our target
vehicle, Ignacio Perez.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.026
Organized crime

06:33.026 --> 06:35.463
snatched him up last year
on drug conspiracy charges.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.465
They found four bricks
of Sinaloa heroin on him,

06:37.465 --> 06:38.632
but he was never charged.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.767
- So he cut a deal.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.134
Get the case file
from Narcotics.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.335
See who Perez
was flipping on.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.637
Maybe they connect
to the body in the truck.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.606
- Yeah, the real issue
is not even trace amounts

06:45.606 --> 06:48.141
of heroin were found
in the truck or on the body.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.943
- And whose identity
is still unknown.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.779
- Yeah, we're still trying
to figure that out.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.947
Minimal blood
found in the truck bed,

06:53.947 --> 06:55.783
but we did find
this lying around.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.385
- All right, so cause of death
is the double tap to the chest.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.588
ME estimates time of death
based on lividity

07:00.588 --> 07:02.355
is about eight hours ago.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.257
Forensics says Perez's gun
is not a match,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.359
and so far none
of his DNA has been found.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.895
- Whatever was attached
to this wrist,

07:07.895 --> 07:10.798
they wanted it bad enough,
and it wasn't heroin.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.967
- Strangest dope tip
I ever worked.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.537
- Tony, what does your source
say about this?

07:16.537 --> 07:19.139
- I don't know.
I left word.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.274
- ASA Kot needs to meet.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.043
Okay, somebody saw something.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.411
The vehicle Perez used.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.913
That garage.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.381
Who paid for that stuff?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.387
- I hate these cases.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.891
I hate that the NSA
is spying on U.S. citizens.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.193
- Write your congressman.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.229
- The problem is,
their tips lead to

07:42.229 --> 07:44.965
unconstitutional
walled-off traffic stops.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.167
My boss hates these cases
because judges hate 'em,

07:47.167 --> 07:50.037
and I was told you were going
after a heroin ring.

07:50.037 --> 07:53.006
- We got a tip from a valued
source within the NSA.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.275
Tip put us
onto something different.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.877
- Yes, my new murder case.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.279
Again,
with zero investigative trail

07:59.279 --> 08:03.383
that I can show a jury as to how
you discovered John Doe here.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.553
- We'll build one.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.320
- With what, Legos?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.790
I want to meet
your mystery source.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.260
- Steve, we can't give up
our source.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.327
You know that.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.829
- Our source isn't the issue.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.298
He's smart, and he'll help us
piece this together.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.701
- Hope so,
'cause this is a loser case.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.070
You got no murder weapon,
no motive.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.839
All you got is some federal Deep
Throat I can't put on the stand.

08:31.812 --> 08:35.683
- Hey, I need your help...
- Okay.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.284
- With Trudy.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.886
I got to figure out
what her ring size is.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.589
- Mou--Mouch,
you're gonna propose?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.624
- Been living in sin
long enough.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.193
- Oh, I require
zero additional detail.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.628
Um, look, I'm on it.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.629
- You're on it.
- Yeah.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.398
- And you can be sneaky?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.200
- I displayed
sociopathic tendencies

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
through the second grade.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.136
I'm on it.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.504
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.976
- Hey, we ID'd
our one-armed man.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.244
His name's Roger Harrington.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.146
His prints are in a defense
department database.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.381
Yeah, 'cause
he worked at Gnomic Systems.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.517
- They make encryption devices
for the Pentagon.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.919
Really sensitive stuff.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.021
His wife, Nora,
happens to also work there.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.925
- We find a connection
between Perez and our victim?

09:17.925 --> 09:20.928
- No, we got nothing.
Zero DNA, no fiber matches.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.029
At this point
we don't even believe

09:22.029 --> 09:24.164
that Perez
killed Roger Harrington.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.399
- Mouse, you get anything off
that phone yet?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.435
- This thing?
No, see, this thing is--

09:28.435 --> 09:30.437
is not a phone.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.505
It's a paperweight.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.041
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.877
When you bring in an offender,
you turn off their phones.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.879
Somebody was monitoring
that thing, all right?

09:38.879 --> 09:41.448
They tracked it back
to the district

09:41.448 --> 09:44.217
and then they wiped it remotely.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.318
- I can get the phone data.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.754
No warrant.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.489
- Great, from your source who,
by the way, have you heard from?

09:49.489 --> 09:52.125
- No, he'll turn up.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.827
- Meanwhile,
we got police work to do.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.963
Come on.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.665
- Hey, man.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.032
I know that
this guy's your source,

09:59.032 --> 10:02.035
but you don't have
to take this all on by yourself.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.937
You know,
we're all here to help.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.573
- Thanks.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.778
- Miss Harrington,
we got to ask.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.379
Was he in any kind of trouble?

10:12.379 --> 10:13.413
Financially?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.614
He drink?
- No.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.583
- Gamble?
- No.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.285
We both work.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.953
I'm in sales.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.255
Barely understand half
of what I'm pitching,

10:22.255 --> 10:24.658
but I hit my numbers.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.961
- Sales, that's a--
that's a lot of travel.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.665
- Some,
but our marriage was solid.

10:31.665 --> 10:35.535
- Mm, solid is good.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.939
- I don't know what they're
going to tell you at Gnomic.

10:38.939 --> 10:43.343
I'm not even sure
what I'm allowed to say, but...

10:43.343 --> 10:48.115
Roger lost his way,
politically.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.884
He said he thought
they were using his work

10:50.884 --> 10:54.387
to wage war
against innocents abroad.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.758
- Well, he made encryption
devices, not weapons, right?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.860
- That's what I told him,

10:59.860 --> 11:05.532
but he said he was going to do
something about it someday.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.135
What if he did?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.570
What if he did
and they killed him?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.205
- They?
- The company.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.741
The Pentagon.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.743
Pick one.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.513
I-I know how I sound.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.952
- You sound like you just
lost your husband.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.090
- How long did you work
with Roger?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.224
- Six years.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.393
I spent more time
with him than my wife.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.764
- Did you notice any changes
in his attitude lately?

11:36.764 --> 11:39.266
- Was he ever coming
into work late or agitated?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.168
- Uh, no, nothing like that.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.170
- I'd like to take a look
at your workspace.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.604
- Uh, sure.
It's over here.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.006
- I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.976
All research
past this door is classified.

11:48.976 --> 11:52.813
- Uh, Miss Goldsmith,
I'm no lawyer,

11:52.813 --> 11:55.115
but just try to
see how this looks from my end.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.583
One of your engineers
gets killed,

11:56.583 --> 11:59.252
and your company brings
in legal counsel to talk to us,

11:59.252 --> 12:01.488
and you start locking doors.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.622
- My office will furnish

12:02.622 --> 12:04.624
any unclassified information
you request,

12:04.624 --> 12:07.460
but this facility
is not yours to search.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.062
- You probably get this
all the time,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.631
but you have
a really winning disposition.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.665
- We're finished here.
- Okay.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.802
- Mm.
We'll be in touch.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.805
- That's great.
- Jay.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.175
We got to call Voight.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.844
We got to get a warrant
to get in there.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.146
- Especially since that lawyer's
the type that'll read it.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.147
- Uh, excuse me.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.816
Uh, detectives.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.184
Uh--

12:31.184 --> 12:33.620
W-what do you know so far?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.856
- About Roger?

12:35.856 --> 12:38.826
- About Gnomic Systems.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.060
We got a problem.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.396
Sat phone encryption chips
walking off campus.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.098
- When was this?
- Tuesday.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.067
The company's investiga--

12:47.067 --> 12:49.837
Look, I wouldn't have
thought about Roger except,

12:49.837 --> 12:54.875
you know, now,
with him getting killed.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.544
- Who would want these chips?

12:57.544 --> 13:00.680
- Bad, bad people.
Terrorist cells.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.950
They'd kill for anything that
keeps their operation secret.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.952
- Why not call the police
when this happened?

13:04.952 --> 13:06.987
- Because these chips
go straight to the Pentagon,

13:06.987 --> 13:08.856
and they don't want to admit
that their gear went missing.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.358
- Uh, kind of, sort of, yeah.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.927
- H-hang on, wait,
can you track these things?

13:13.927 --> 13:16.429
- Look, I--
I got to get back.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.565
I'm sorry.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.900
- Wow.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.472
- Dominic, tenth time.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.408
About that thing.

13:28.408 --> 13:33.680
My friends have some questions
for you.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.220
- We need to talk.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.788
- I almost blasted you.
Where the hell have you been?

13:41.788 --> 13:44.324
- You need to drop this case,
forget my name,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.093
and walk away.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.929
- Walk away from what?
- You want to talk?

13:48.929 --> 13:51.131
Drive some place secure.

13:57.905 --> 13:58.005
.

13:58.906 --> 13:59.306
- One thing at a time.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.741
We can't drop this case.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.444
Your tip put us on to a body.
- A body?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.679
- A murder,
and we didn't find narcotics.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.281
- Yeah, no, I know.
I screwed up, all right?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.549
I heard
a flagged phone call.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.618
They said they were, quote,
moving major weight.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.120
It was put
to a known drug runner.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.988
- That weight
was our victim's body.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.924
He was killed
for stolen Pentagon gear.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.491
Encryption chips.
Whatever the hell those do.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.759
- I know--
I know all that,

14:19.759 --> 14:21.962
but my problem is that
the Department of Defense

14:21.962 --> 14:25.098
and the NSA do not want
this story getting out.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.037
- Dominic, you didn't have
approval to bring me this case?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.038
- I didn't.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.339
I come back
from lunch today.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.706
My buddy's waiting for me
in the parking lot.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.575
Tells me security
is sweeping my office.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.576
- They know you came to me?

14:36.576 --> 14:39.212
[footsteps approaching]

14:39.212 --> 14:40.813
This is my sergeant.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.815
Dominic, they know?

14:42.815 --> 14:43.984
They know you came to me?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.185
- Yeah, well,
it didn't help that you went

14:45.185 --> 14:47.754
poking around
a Pentagon contractor.

14:47.754 --> 14:48.956
This is bad.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.557
NSA thinks I'm some kind
of rogue agent.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.626
Like I've got an agenda
to embarrass the government.

14:53.626 --> 14:57.764
- So, do you have an agenda
I need to know about?

14:57.764 --> 14:59.299
- No, I don't.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.868
Look, these guys stole
Pentagon encryption chips.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.404
You should just let
the feds go after 'em.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.506
Believe me, you do not want
people like this for enemies.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.508
- You don't get it.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.978
We're down the road
on a homicide now, bro.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.579
- All right, so, all right.
What happens for me then?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.414
- You help us
solve this thing.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.716
Clear your name.
It's the only way out for you.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.652
- Look, the driver you put us
onto had a phone.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.788
Somebody wiped the data.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.991
- Can you recover it for us?

15:23.991 --> 15:25.092
- Look, if you can
keep me safe,

15:25.092 --> 15:26.994
I can do things that
can honestly scare you.

15:36.403 --> 15:40.640
- Holding Jack high and you
raise the Chief of Dicks.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.810
- I mean, where I come from,
you got to fake it

15:43.810 --> 15:45.078
'till you make it, Captain.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.679
- Well, I'm just glad
I brought in a ringer

15:46.679 --> 15:48.448
who put Pollard
in his place.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.283
- Well, I just got to appreciate
you for sitting me down

15:50.283 --> 15:51.751
with the caliber
of those kind of brothers.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.520
- Yeah, well,
it's every Thursday.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.590
So, you will now.
- Thank you.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.492
- Whenever you're ready.
- Oh, thank you.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.528
- No, no, no.

16:01.528 --> 16:06.133
Look, um, Sean Roman
and Kimberly Burgess?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.235
- She usually just goes by Kim,
but yeah.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.938
- They, um, picked up my son
Nathan on a possession beef.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.406
He's an adult now.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.408
19 going on 11,
if you ask his mother,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.778
but he's a good kid.
He's no kingpin.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.749
- I mean, you could wipe
that out in two seconds.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.451
- You'd be doing me
a favor.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.887
I'm a man who remembers
a man who did me a favor.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.325
- Yeah, I'll definitely see
what I can do.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.095
Um, I mean,
he's a good kid, right?

16:35.095 --> 16:39.799
- I already said he was.
Look, finish your pie.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.569
I'll see you around.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.075
- Yeah, yeah...

16:48.075 --> 16:51.311
Wait, hold on,
we can't kick Olinsky out.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.545
I mean,
where does Michelle go, then?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.247
- Look, I love him.
I want to be hospitable,

16:54.247 --> 16:57.550
I do, but also,
I like to get laid.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.818
- Well, you're helping out
a friend.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.919
That's a turn-on to me.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.088
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.489
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.092
- Well, in that case, let's
invite his brother in, too.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.094
'Cause he's basically
hand to mouth.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.964
- Adam.
- Yeah.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.165
- You know, we're helping out,

17:13.165 --> 17:16.769
but what we really need
is our own place.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.573
- Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.943
We'll get Olinsky on his feet,
and we'll find our own place.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.212
That's a good--
that's a good idea.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.746
- Hey.
- Yeah?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.648
Yeah.
- It's not an idea.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.117
It's a demand.

17:30.117 --> 17:33.120
A loving
but very specific demand.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.688
- That's what I thought.
- Good.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.025
- Gonna change.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.528
[indistinct chatter]

17:41.528 --> 17:43.130
- I don't know
what this means.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.598
- Of course you don't.
- Yo.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.234
- Yo--
- No, no.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.337
That's his
"I want a favor" yo.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.905
- Well, yeah, uh--
[clears throat]

17:56.143 --> 18:00.213
Um, the kid you picked up
yesterday, Nathan Whitaker.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.215
You know who his father is?

18:02.215 --> 18:05.385
- Did not investigate that one.
- James Whitaker.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.388
He's a captain, and, you know,
he's not really a bad kid.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.223
I mean, he hung out
with the wrong dudes.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.892
Made a mistake.
He's no kingpin.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.028
So you think we
can look the other way?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.797
- So his dad leaned on you?
- Yeah.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.667
So hard that there's an imprint
in my skull.

18:20.667 --> 18:24.604
So you'd be doing me a solid.
Thanks.

18:24.604 --> 18:28.208
- Whoa, hey,
let me consult with my partner.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.042
I mean,
are we cool with this, or...

18:30.042 --> 18:31.077
- Yeah, I mean, I get it.

18:31.077 --> 18:34.013
You know, back in the day, I--
never mind.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.748
Point is someone
greased the wheels.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
Everybody won.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.985
- Consider it done.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.187
- That's my girl.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.190
Thanks.
- Sure.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.658
- Everybody, this
is Dominic Grillo.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.759
He's, uh--

18:46.759 --> 18:48.828
- I'm the reason
you guys are all here.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.397
So I couldn't
sleep last night

18:50.397 --> 18:52.965
so I ran a Memex search
on the flagged phone.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.802
- Dominic, Memex?
- What's Memex?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.037
- It's a visual search tool
developed by DARPA.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.207
It displays links
within criminal enterprises.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.275
I've never actually seen it.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.710
- Yeah, well, here it is.

19:03.710 --> 19:07.046
In this case, the links
are between cell phones.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.482
We got about 12 cell phones
in this cluster.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.550
Most of 'em are burners.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.851
No name.
We don't know who they are,

19:11.851 --> 19:15.222
but the nexus
is Nora Harrington.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.225
Every one of these phones
called her at least once.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.793
- Nora Harrington.
Victim's wife.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.496
- So she set the whole thing up?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.565
- Meaning she's got
the stolen chips.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.534
She works in sales.
She's gonna sell them.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.036
- Her husband had access
to that gear.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.538
So she used him
as her inside man.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.705
- Yeah, but how does a woman

19:32.705 --> 19:35.041
looks like that,
runs in her circles,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.644
end up in bed
with a career drug runner?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.313
And more important,
who's she selling to?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.582
- Well, likely buyers
are terrorists.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.284
Local guys
with connections overseas.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.254
- All right,
so I'm gonna state the obvious.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.357
We're trying to solve a homicide
by looking for computer parts.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.259
- Yeah, well,
we got no weapon,

19:52.259 --> 19:54.294
no homicide scene.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.396
We're gonna solve this,
we got to find those chips

19:56.396 --> 19:57.664
before they disappear.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.447
- You're up.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.616
- Listen, I jammed
the cell signal on her alarm,

20:16.616 --> 20:18.685
but she's got a backup
in the pantry.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.953
- We see anything, you get
the hell out of there, Mouse.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.922
I mean, right away.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.791
- Let's do this.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.473
[clicking]

20:40.473 --> 20:43.510
[alarm sounding]

21:45.171 --> 21:46.739
- Target's coming back, guys.
You got to move.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.074
Go, go, go.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.909
- Come on, Olinsky's done
this a thousand times.

22:08.428 --> 22:08.561
.

22:09.862 --> 22:10.630
- Oh, ho, ho.
Well, that was close.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.667
We only got four
of the five cameras in.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.169
- Well, it's better
than nothing.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.206
[typing]

22:29.215 --> 22:31.851
- The worst part was...
- The smell.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.454
- First thing, I'm gonna
take a whole bunch of showers.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.556
It was straight up nasty.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.825
- Well, just don't
get sent back.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.260
Listen, I don't care
how much juice you got downtown.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.929
I can't swing this twice.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.564
- Yeah, I messed up.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.499
I know it,

22:46.499 --> 22:48.768
and I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.837
- Ain't nothing, bro.
You thank your dad.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.972
I'm just
a homie helping out.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.341
Now you might wanna--I mean,
you got some stuff in your hair.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.886
- Look at her.
Like nothing happened.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.088
- What were you expecting,
crocodile tears?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.356
She thinks
no one's watching.

23:10.356 --> 23:13.493
- A fully committed murderer
would stay in character.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.261
That's all I'm saying.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.530
- I'm gonna sleep
with one eye open.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.337
- Who is this guy?

23:25.337 --> 23:26.473
I didn't get his face.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.475
[knocking]

23:37.383 --> 23:39.552
[classical music
playing loudly]

23:39.552 --> 23:42.221
[sighs]

23:42.221 --> 23:44.223
So much for getting anything
on tape.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.358
- No, we're getting plenty.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.760
Hey, Mouse, you seeing this?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.928
Run facial recognition.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.162
We got to know
who this guy is.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.100
- They went right
for the stereo.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.568
You think she made us?

23:55.568 --> 23:58.137
- I think she's more nervous
than she's letting on.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.151
- Burgess?
- Sergeant.

24:19.726 --> 24:20.727
- [sighs]

24:20.727 --> 24:22.762
- Oh, I put too much
of this on.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.538
It's got almond oil.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.741
- I feel like
we just made out.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.076
I don--

24:37.076 --> 24:38.778
like I should
make you a mix tape.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.115
- Oh, no need.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.151
Have a good day.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.558
- Hey, what are you doing
on my equipment?

24:51.558 --> 24:54.060
- I'm running a criminal facial
recognition program.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.427
- Okay, on who?

24:55.427 --> 24:58.264
- Um, I didn't find anybody.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.300
- What, on this guy?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.937
- Uh, yeah,
what are you running on that?

25:04.937 --> 25:06.272
- Yeah,
it's a corporate database.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.640
See, I called Gnomic Systems,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.441
and they gave me access
because I work for the police.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.579
'Cause sometimes
you just got to ask.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.147
Gentleman,
meet Aaron Franceur.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.149
- Guy that showed at the house.
- Yeah, the one and only.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.786
He's naval academy,
et cetera, et cetera.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.888
The interesting part is
that he's the head of security

25:21.888 --> 25:23.155
at Gnomic Systems.

25:23.155 --> 25:26.125
[phone ringing]

25:26.125 --> 25:27.860
- You're on speaker.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.428
- Man inside's coming out.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.630
Should we follow?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.231
- Negative.
Stand fast.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.200
We need someone
sitting on Nora's house.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.036
- If he's wrapped up
in this,

25:37.036 --> 25:38.605
he could be holding
the encryption chips

25:38.605 --> 25:40.172
to sell himself.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.841
Could be he's our killer.

25:41.841 --> 25:45.745
- Expedite a search warrant
for his home and his office.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.246
Get Olinsky the address.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.822
- How's Callie holding up?

25:57.523 --> 25:59.425
- I haven't talked to her
since Andrew's wake.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.494
- A wake for
a seven-year-old kid, I mean...

26:03.630 --> 26:08.434
- Yeah, it was nice.
Big family.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.638
Then the kid's dad
shows up half in the bag.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.973
When he gets there
he goes right for the whiskey.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.843
Callie couldn't
pull the bottle.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.445
I talked sense into him.

26:19.445 --> 26:22.348
- 2113 respond
to 1301 South Fairfax.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.784
CFD Ambulance 41
is requesting the police.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.153
Multiple narcotic overdoses.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.988
- 2113 squad,
we're en route.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.024
- Copy that, 2113.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.002
- Hey, what's going on?

26:43.002 --> 26:46.538
- Uh, I found these
in her bag.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.275
It's not a brand
I'm familiar with.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.509
- Club drugs.

26:50.509 --> 26:53.579
- Hey, where'd you get these?
- Some guy.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.783
He said--
he said his name was Base.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.786
- Okay.

26:59.786 --> 27:00.887
- Hey, Burgess.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.890
Hey! Stop!

27:03.890 --> 27:05.692
Hey!

27:15.034 --> 27:16.368
- Clear.

27:21.507 --> 27:22.842
- Let me see your hands!

27:22.842 --> 27:25.211
Turn around--turn around!

27:25.211 --> 27:28.915
Against the wall!

27:28.915 --> 27:31.250
- Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!

27:34.053 --> 27:36.088
What's up, Base?

27:43.562 --> 27:45.998
- Aaron Franceur,

27:45.998 --> 27:48.935
we're here to search
your office and then your home.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.102
- For what?

27:50.102 --> 27:53.605
- Stolen company property.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.108
- You got yourself turned around
like you wouldn't believe.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.945
- Yeah, well, we'll see.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.118
- You run security
at Gnomic Systems.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.486
- For six years now, yeah.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.022
- What were you doing
at Nora Harrington's house?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.658
- Her husband's dead.
I was consoling her.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.260
We're friends.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.995
- You see our problem?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.496
We know she's nervous.

28:17.496 --> 28:20.366
She's got to sell those chips
soon, and then you show up.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.970
- You think I'm involved?

28:23.970 --> 28:25.304
You kidding?

28:31.143 --> 28:33.645
I went to ask her
some questions.

28:33.645 --> 28:34.847
See what she knows
about her husband

28:34.847 --> 28:37.149
stealing from the company.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.185
- So what did she say?

28:46.793 --> 28:48.828
- Talking to one of my employees
without me?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.296
- You know,
he came on his own violation.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.497
I mean, volition.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.599
- Very cute, Detective.

28:53.599 --> 28:56.335
- Don't be clichÃ©.
Be the nice lawyer.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.805
- They just sat down.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.508
- How about the stuff
you're not telling me?

29:02.508 --> 29:05.677
- Dana Goldsmith,
lawyer for Gnomic Systems.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.079
- Chief legal counsel.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.580
What the hell's going on?

29:08.580 --> 29:11.818
- Your guy here is stepping all
over my murder investigation.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.352
- Unlawfully?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.821
As in,
are you charging him?

29:14.821 --> 29:16.322
'Cause otherwise I'm
walking out with him,

29:16.322 --> 29:18.825
and any other questions
you have go through me.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.006
- No, no, no.
Why's she going upstairs?

29:34.006 --> 29:36.142
We didn't get to place
the cameras upstairs.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.977
- I don't know.
What do people do upstairs?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.178
[sirens wailing]

29:39.178 --> 29:40.346
- All right,
I'm sick of waiting.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.848
Time to bring
Nora Harrington in.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.851
[sirens approaching]

29:44.851 --> 29:45.852
- What do you want to do?
You want to go?

29:45.852 --> 29:46.953
- Yeah.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.388
- Sarge, hold on.
We got to go in on foot.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.423
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:53.559 --> 29:55.661
- Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

29:55.661 --> 29:56.863
We got to get into this house.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.297
- No, we got a gas leak
in there.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.299
- Really?
You got a gas leak?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.068
- Look, man, we really got
to get into this house, now.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.735
- You're not gonna get in
that house until it's cleared.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.771
Period.
End of story.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.583
- Oh, man, she's playing us.

30:22.922 --> 30:23.055
.

30:23.789 --> 30:24.556
- So, basically,
how'd we end up here?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.493
- I told the kid
to watch his step.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.729
- He didn't listen.
- I'm not his PO,

30:30.729 --> 30:31.998
and we know who his dad is.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.666
So let's just think
about this for a minute.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.468
- I already thought about it.
This kid lied to us.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.803
He lied to all of us.

30:37.803 --> 30:41.207
He's got to go.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.209
- Kim?

30:43.209 --> 30:47.713
- Kevin, somebody's got
to do the right thing here.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.481
We called you out of courtesy.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.984
Now, whose name
goes down in the report?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.923
- Mine.

30:56.923 --> 30:59.158
Mine.
It's my problem.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.694
- For the record,
you're getting worked.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.795
- What the hell
you trying to say, Roman?

31:03.795 --> 31:05.932
- Kevin, take yes for an answer
and go.

31:10.069 --> 31:13.940
- Nathan, come on, man.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.307
Let's walk.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.484
- So where we at?

31:25.484 --> 31:28.154
- Well, an investigative alert
is out on Nora Harrington.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.688
She can't get on a train.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.959
She can't go near an airport,
and her car is in the garage.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.127
- She's still here.
Trying to make a deal.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.395
Question is, where?

31:36.395 --> 31:37.496
- Yeah, who knows.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.166
I mean, she could be anywhere,
right?

31:40.166 --> 31:42.234
You know, the truth is,
the longer I stick around here

31:42.234 --> 31:43.702
with you guys,
the worse I look.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.037
The more guilty I look.

31:45.037 --> 31:49.675
That's it,
I am turning myself in.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.044
- Hey, put the phone down.

31:55.881 --> 31:58.284
Just take a beat.
We're close.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.718
- Yeah, you are close.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.221
To what you care about--
your case.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.156
- You turn yourself in now,
and they own you,

32:04.156 --> 32:05.424
and they tell your story.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.493
We're your only way out.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.995
- That's a great speech.
I mean, really,

32:08.995 --> 32:10.529
I can tell you've rehearsed it
a lot--it's great.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.830
No wonder you've got
so many informants coming

32:11.830 --> 32:13.132
in and out of here all the time.
- Take a seat.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.633
- I'm not doing it, Antonio.
- Sit down.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.902
I'm done! You're not gonna get--
- Hey, guys, guys, guys!

32:18.670 --> 32:20.872
Memex.

32:20.872 --> 32:23.009
Memex search

32:23.009 --> 32:25.911
all phones related
to Nora Harrington.

32:25.911 --> 32:30.182
But you geotag 'em
going back six months.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.218
- That's actually pretty smart.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.919
She knows we're looking
for her now

32:33.919 --> 32:37.123
but she doesn't know I can track
her going back six months.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.092
Okay, these larger circles

32:40.092 --> 32:42.628
represent where the phones
have been used most frequently.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.696
- There.
What's that?

32:44.696 --> 32:46.165
- Stay-Safe Longterm Storage.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.200
Unit 8239.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.469
- All right, this phone
was there four times including--

32:50.469 --> 32:51.837
Uh, what was the victim's
time of death?

32:51.837 --> 32:54.140
both: 1:30 a.m.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.042
- One hour after.

32:56.042 --> 32:58.344
- All right, find out
who's renting that unit.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.579
Get everyone.
We roll out now.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.693
[whistles]

33:27.306 --> 33:30.309
- All right, we're too late.
Any activity outside?

33:30.309 --> 33:32.111
- No one coming or going.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.146
[door slams]

33:42.088 --> 33:44.256
- Go, we'll clear
this floor.

33:58.237 --> 33:59.605
- Clear.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.498
- Don't move!
- Put your hands on your head.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.869
Now!
Get down on the ground!

34:30.869 --> 34:33.038
- We've done nothing wrong.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.906
- We've got two
in custody with the gear.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.574
No sign of Nora Harrington.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.687
- Anything?

34:48.687 --> 34:49.721
[car beeps]

34:53.692 --> 34:56.462
Al, Atwater, and Ruzek,
get in that alley.

34:56.462 --> 34:57.596
Target's coming to you.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.839
- I'm right behind him.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.782
[truck beeping]

35:20.819 --> 35:22.788
[tires squealing]

35:33.699 --> 35:33.899
.

35:33.932 --> 35:34.366
- Put your hands up!

35:35.033 --> 35:38.570
Put 'em up!

35:38.570 --> 35:40.939
- Aaron Franceur.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.941
Don't you move.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.077
Put your hands on the car.
- [grunts]

35:46.077 --> 35:48.714
- Oh, we got a bag.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.326
- Ah, what's that look like?

36:00.326 --> 36:01.827
About $2 million there, Kev?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.995
- About $2 million,
give or take.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.231
- We'll count it for you.

36:08.066 --> 36:11.403
- So, you and Nora Harrington.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.405
- We met at work.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.840
We both spent time overseas.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.776
We had more in common
than her and her husband.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.512
She convinced him to liberate
the gear from the lab.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.348
- And you plan was always, what?

36:22.348 --> 36:24.916
Clip the husband?
Just disappear?

36:24.916 --> 36:28.454
- No, Roger showed
to give me the chips.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.921
He tried to get tough.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.290
Said he knew about me and Nora.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.424
Said he didn't need us.

36:32.424 --> 36:35.994
So I--

36:35.994 --> 36:37.963
I did what you know I did.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.766
- But now you got to move a body
and show up at work.

36:40.766 --> 36:44.270
So you call Ignacio Perez.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.871
- My brother owns buildings
on the west side.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.506
Perez collected rent.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.941
Didn't mind
getting his hands dirty.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.011
- Well, you shouldn't
have done that.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.914
'Cause Perez's phone
was on a list.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.016
If you'd just called
your mommy,

36:58.016 --> 36:59.651
you and me
never would have met.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.353
- Me and Nora.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.390
Two days ago we were--

37:04.390 --> 37:06.525
I don't know.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.895
We weren't this.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.097
- You know where Nora's at now?

37:12.097 --> 37:15.801
- Yeah, she's waiting on me.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.631
- Hey, hi.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.137
- Ooh, little late.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.406
Your boy really wanted
to talk.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.107
Couldn't shut him up.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.676
- Uh, it's this way.
I'll show you back.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.945
- I know the way.
One moment.

38:11.557 --> 38:15.761
- What is that?
- Nothing.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.696
- Phone number.
I'll kill her.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.030
- Mm.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.375
- Hmm.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.510
- You didn't see anything.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.048
- I have to say,
I'm impressed.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.450
- Yeah.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.951
- The Department of Justice
cannot compel me

38:39.951 --> 38:41.987
to express that,
but I am.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.656
- Who were they?
The two guys we caught.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.793
- Naturalized citizens with ties
to a terror network in Iraq.

38:47.793 --> 38:50.562
You disrupted a very real effort
for their people to do violence.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.531
They'd gone dark,
fallen off our watch list,

38:52.531 --> 38:53.865
until you found them.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.734
- Yeah, well, none of this
would have happened

38:55.734 --> 38:57.769
if it weren't for
Dominic Grillo, over there.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.406
And I made certain assurances
to Mr. Grillo

39:00.406 --> 39:02.408
in exchange
for his cooperation.

39:02.408 --> 39:05.877
- He had no authorization
to furnish that data.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.747
He's lucky we don't
charge him with treason.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.315
We will need
those encryption chips

39:10.315 --> 39:11.883
before anything's agreed to.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.919
- No, those are evidence.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.187
Do we have a deal?

39:20.426 --> 39:21.593
- What do you get
out of all this?

39:21.593 --> 39:25.263
- Me?
I get a murder.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.872
- I'll smooth things over
with Mr. Grillo's superiors.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.443
But I need those chips.

39:37.443 --> 39:41.513
- All right.
No problem, then.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.552
- Steve.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.921
- Hank.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.993
- So we're good?
I can go home?

39:54.993 --> 39:58.630
- Please--I say this
with love--go home.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.334
- Never doubted you guys.
Remember that.

40:03.334 --> 40:04.570
- Dominic, go home.

40:08.273 --> 40:09.541
- It's not right.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.077
Kevin's about to do
something really risky.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.078
And for what?

40:13.078 --> 40:15.180
To get in good
with some captain?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.749
- My uncle, epic guy.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.585
Not an honest bone
in his body.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.487
But he taught me,
and he taught me good.

40:21.487 --> 40:24.556
This city runs
on a handshake and a wink.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.225
If Atwater's banking a favor,
good for him.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.797
- Oh, hey, Mouch.
- Yeah?

40:31.797 --> 40:34.500
- Um, what's it been, like,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.502
6 1/2 weeks
since I saw you, I think?

40:38.904 --> 40:41.039
- 6 1/2?

40:41.039 --> 40:42.741
- Yeah, I'm sure.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.010
6 1/2, yeah.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.747
- Well, hon, why don't we just
keep this party rolling.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.016
Burgess, whatever.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.020
- 6 1/2, huh?
- Yeah, it's Platt's ring size.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.387
I'm kind of a genius.

40:59.591 --> 41:03.529
- Hey, uh, one second.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.531
Hey, Callie.
- Hi.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.565
- You, uh, you okay?

41:06.565 --> 41:08.834
- Yeah, yeah.
Um, it's Ritchie.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.802
He came by, um...

41:13.171 --> 41:15.774
Can we go for a walk
on Lakeshore or something?

41:15.774 --> 41:19.945
I just feel like I need
to hear the water.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.446
- Uh, sure.
- Yeah?

41:21.446 --> 41:23.549
- Yeah, one sec.
- Okay.

41:23.549 --> 41:26.184
- Hey, uh--
I got to take off.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.087
- Roman, you do remember
that's a woman in mourning

41:29.087 --> 41:31.422
with a psychotic ex-husband.

41:31.422 --> 41:34.192
- I got it.
It's under control.

41:34.192 --> 41:38.163
- Is it?
- Yeah.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.566
I'll see you later.
- Bye.

41:44.770 --> 41:48.073
Hey, doc.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.909
That woman just
left with my partner.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.210
- Gal who left with Roman?

41:52.210 --> 41:56.214
- Yeah. I mean,
did she seem stable to you?

41:56.214 --> 41:59.184
- "Stable"?
Who's stable?

42:03.421 --> 42:05.657
- Yeah, right.
