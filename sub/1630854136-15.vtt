00:09.444 --> 00:11.489
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:12.795
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.795 --> 00:15.189
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.189 --> 00:17.017
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.889
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:21.760
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:25.895 --> 00:27.070
Hey, you!

00:27.070 --> 00:28.724
Hey! Hold on a minute!

00:28.724 --> 00:29.942
Hands in the air!
- Oh, hey! Wait! Whoa!

00:29.942 --> 00:31.248
- Now!
- Hey, guys!

00:31.248 --> 00:32.858
Whoa! On a job!

00:32.858 --> 00:35.078
I'm headed to a murder scene
right around the corner.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.514
And what'd I say
about those hands?

00:36.514 --> 00:39.039
Officer,
they're still in the air, OK?

00:39.039 --> 00:41.302
I'm a detective with the 2-7.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.086
- Hey, get on the ground.
- There's no need for that.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.174
You gotta listen
to what I'm saying.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.784
You heard him.
Down on the ground.

00:45.784 --> 00:46.959
Do it now.

00:46.959 --> 00:47.960
You can put the weapon down.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.137
I'm with the 2-7.
I'm a detective.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.660
My shield is in my coat.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.664
I'm just gonna
show you my shield, OK?

00:55.664 --> 00:57.448
This doesn't have to escalate.
- Don't do it.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.015
- Hey! Hey!
- No, listen!

00:59.015 --> 01:00.538
Listen to me!
- Calm down!

01:00.538 --> 01:02.062
- You're making a mistake!
- Stand still!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.628
- Stop moving! Comply!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:03.628 --> 01:05.152
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

01:05.152 --> 01:07.806
That's my partner!
We're on the job!

01:07.806 --> 01:09.547
We're detectives of the 2-7!

01:09.547 --> 01:10.983
Get off him!
- Get the hell off me!

01:10.983 --> 01:12.289
- Hey, back off!
- That's my partner!

01:12.289 --> 01:13.290
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:13.290 --> 01:14.639
- What's wrong with us?
- Idiot!

01:14.639 --> 01:16.380
Idiot!
What is wrong with you?

01:16.380 --> 01:18.208
Why? Why?
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.383
What's wrong with you,
you idiot?

01:19.383 --> 01:20.993
We thought
he was a murder suspect!

01:20.993 --> 01:23.692
- Why? Why did you think that?
- Jalen, easy. Easy.

01:23.692 --> 01:24.867
- Did you see what he just did?
- Yes, I did.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.390
Hey, a lot of people
say they're cops.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.565
Do they have a badge?

01:27.565 --> 01:29.263
It's just
a misunderstanding, OK?

01:29.263 --> 01:30.916
We're just trying
to do our jobs, bro.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.223
- Yeah, doing our jobs.
- Taking your badges down.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.790
- Don't do that. Come on.
- That's not your job!

01:34.790 --> 01:36.705
- Guys, get out of here.
- This is not over.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.750
- I said get out of here!
- Hey, you're gonna be sorry!

01:38.750 --> 01:41.449
- We're gonna be sorry, huh?
- You're gonna be sorry!

01:41.449 --> 01:44.452
- Just walk away!
- Get the hell out of here!

01:44.452 --> 01:46.932
Jalen. Jalen, easy, easy.

01:46.932 --> 01:50.153
I know. Easy.

01:50.153 --> 01:53.025
You good?

01:53.025 --> 01:54.462
Yeah.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.421
Just another day in paradise.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.735
Likely cause of death is
blunt force trauma to the head.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.738
Ooh, smells like
he took a bath in merlot.

02:53.738 --> 02:57.699
That bottle is probably
the murder weapon.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.004
You think?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.658
Bag that.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.313
Get it over to the lab.
Check the DNA.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.924
- Any witnesses?
- None so far.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.797
Who found the body?

03:08.797 --> 03:10.364
A sanitation worker.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.975
A lot of door cams
on this block.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.933
Get a video canvass
of the area as well.

03:14.933 --> 03:18.894
Oh, the killer left
a $5,000 watch.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.374
And his cell phone.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.332
Not a robbery.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.856
- Is that the wallet?
- Yeah.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.384
Still got cash
and credit cards.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.342
Darian Marshall, MD.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.126
A doctor.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.041
What's that Bible saying?

03:36.041 --> 03:40.220
He saved others,
but he couldn't save himself.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.059
Hey.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.800
How's it going?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.805
- What are you doing here?
- Peace offering.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.156
I came here to apologize.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.854
Yeah, I see that.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.856
You're not much
for small talk.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.293
Correct.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.425
OK.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.516
I'm up for detective.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.605
You filing a complaint against
me is not going to help,

04:17.605 --> 04:20.999
so I'm asking you to look past

04:20.999 --> 04:25.395
my unfortunate and emotional
reaction to the situation.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.441
We were looking for a killer.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.007
Tensions were high.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.662
Yeah. Then along came
a big, strapping brother,

04:31.662 --> 04:33.403
so he'll do, right?
- That's not what I--

04:33.403 --> 04:36.667
You had your guns drawn,
pointed at me.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.713
You didn't even give me
a chance to show you my badge.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.497
We thought we were
staring down the suspect

04:40.497 --> 04:41.759
of a murder investigation.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.371
You knew you were
looking at a Black man,

04:44.371 --> 04:45.763
and you assumed

04:45.763 --> 04:47.896
that he was a subject
of a murder investigation.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.464
For all you knew, it could
have been a 5' white woman.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.987
It's always about race.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.772
It always is with you guys,
isn't it?

04:54.772 --> 04:56.165
Do what you gotta do, Detective,

04:56.165 --> 04:58.646
but I'd think real hard
about your next move.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.346
You threatening me?

05:03.346 --> 05:06.741
I'm just saying,
this is the brotherhood.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.352
Brotherhood based
on the color blue.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.105
Victim is a heart surgeon.
As of now, no witnesses.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.194
- Video?
- Nothing so far.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.239
Any indication
it was a mugging?

05:27.239 --> 05:29.851
Victim had a wallet
full of cash in his pocket

05:29.851 --> 05:31.983
and expensive jewelry on,
so I don't think so.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.855
Maybe it was
a drug deal gone bad.

05:33.855 --> 05:37.641
It's possible, but he was
a cardiothoracic surgeon,

05:37.641 --> 05:39.339
so why--

05:42.603 --> 05:46.520
Just riffing here, Jalen.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.219
Not a lot of trafficking
in that area, Lieu.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.829
There was no paraphernalia

05:51.829 --> 05:54.615
or residue
in the victim's possessions,

05:54.615 --> 05:57.313
and there was no drugs
or alcohol in his system.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.054
- ME give a time of death?
- Yeah.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.404
Sometime between
9:00 p.m. and midnight.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.405
What else do we know
about the vic?

06:02.405 --> 06:03.667
Divorced.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.277
Lived and worked
in the Upper East Side.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.279
Any reason why he was down
in the meatpacking district?

06:07.279 --> 06:09.499
Not yet, but we are
running his financials.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.935
Put together a timeline.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.894
We'll start at the hospital
where he worked.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.689
Down to earth, friendly.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.300
Dr. Marshall was one
of the good ones.

06:28.300 --> 06:32.000
Always made a point of asking
about my wife and kids.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.525
There it is.

06:37.092 --> 06:40.182
Time stamp says
he left at 7:42 p.m.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.531
Look at that guy.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.446
He seems to be
following Dr. Marshall.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.405
Do you have any video
from outside?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.971
Check it out.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.539
Yeah, Marshall's
talking to that guy.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.236
Who is he?

06:51.236 --> 06:52.977
His name's Hopkins.

06:52.977 --> 06:56.024
He's a doctor.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.330
Thank you.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
I heard what happened.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.292
Tragic. A real loss.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.643
But I'm not sure
how I can help.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.863
Dr. Hopkins, is there
anyone you can think of

07:08.863 --> 07:10.952
who wanted to hurt him?
- No.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.172
I may not be
the right person to ask.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.913
I didn't know him that well.

07:15.913 --> 07:19.569
You worked together
for a couple of years.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.050
Yeah.
How did you two get along?

07:22.050 --> 07:24.966
We were cordial.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.491
If I think of anything,
I'll let you know.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.753
I need to get back
to my patients.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.277
Oh, according
to the chief of surgery,

07:32.277 --> 07:34.410
you're not allowed
to see patients anymore, right?

07:34.410 --> 07:36.107
You're on administrative duty.

07:36.107 --> 07:39.023
And we understand
that Dr. Marshall had something

07:39.023 --> 07:41.025
to do with that.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.027
I think I'd like
to contact my attorney.

07:43.027 --> 07:46.248
I think that attorney should
meet you down to the precinct.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.775
We got you on video

07:51.775 --> 07:54.299
two hours
before Dr. Marshall was killed.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.780
You were yelling at him.
You shoved him into a wall.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.695
Plus, we know
that Dr. Marshall

07:58.695 --> 08:01.132
was accusing you of misconduct.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.699
Said that you were

08:02.699 --> 08:05.485
performing unnecessary
bypass surgeries on patients.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.791
Dr. Hopkins will be
fully exonerated.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.880
Dr. Marshall was scheduled
to testify against you.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.752
I've done nothing wrong.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.667
I present the pros and cons
of the surgery,

08:13.667 --> 08:16.147
and patients made
their own risk assessments.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.498
Marshall's patients
didn't trust him.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.718
A lot of them ended up coming
to me for second opinions.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.894
So Dr. Marshall
cooked up a bunch of lies

08:23.894 --> 08:25.809
to make himself look better.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.377
The Department of Public
Health might beg to differ.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.161
Come on.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.642
Clearly, you had a bone
to pick with the man.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.036
You're right.
I couldn't stand him.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.821
He was sanctimonious, butted
into everyone's business,

08:37.821 --> 08:39.431
but that doesn't mean
I killed him.

08:39.431 --> 08:42.522
Where'd you go that night
after you left the hospital?

08:42.522 --> 08:43.958
A theater.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.006
Dr. Hopkins's alibi
checks out.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.660
He went to the theater
with his wife.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.837
Saw "Othello,"
in case you were wondering.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.318
Then they had dinner,
car service home.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.886
So I got ticket stubs, credit
card receipts, and video.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.714
I just got
into the victim's phone.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.716
The last time he used it
was for a rideshare app.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.806
Car picked him up
at Mercy General at 7:48 p.m.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.590
- Where'd he go?
- A condo building

09:07.590 --> 09:09.592
two blocks
from the crime scene.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.680
On our way.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.116
Nice work, Yee.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.771
Thanks.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.643
So you made up your mind?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.645
You gonna file the report?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.951
Not sure.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.475
Any words of wisdom
you wanna impart?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.216
Nothing
you haven't heard before.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.436
Blue wall. Brotherhood.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.004
Best to resolve these things
off the record.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.050
You know,
all those cop clichés.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.923
But they are clichés
for a reason.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.664
You're not saying I should
turn the other cheek, are you?

09:37.664 --> 09:40.144
I'm saying
that cops have long memories.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.450
But I'm white.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.321
Things like that never happen
to guys like me.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.628
- Nope.
- But...

09:49.414 --> 09:52.635
If you wanna press charges
and roll these pricks up,

09:52.635 --> 09:54.724
I got your back till the end.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.334
Appreciate that, Frank.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.651
Darian and I had our issues,
but he was a good man.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.522
Worked really hard
to get where he was.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.960
He was a great father too.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.875
Please.
- Thank you.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.703
When did you two split up?

10:18.661 --> 10:21.446
We finalized the divorce
a couple months ago.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.058
And why did he come by here
last night?

10:24.058 --> 10:27.017
He came to see our daughter.
We just moved in.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.366
Darian had never
been here before.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.673
And how long did he stay?

10:30.673 --> 10:33.676
About an hour.
We all had dinner together.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.852
Did he happen to mention
where he was going afterwards?

10:35.852 --> 10:38.289
No.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.378
I kind of
rushed him out of here.

10:40.378 --> 10:45.122
My new boyfriend was
coming over, and he...

10:45.122 --> 10:46.907
I didn't want any drama.

10:46.907 --> 10:49.257
What?
Those two don't get along?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.562
No.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.870
Greg, my boyfriend,
he gets jealous.

10:53.870 --> 10:58.701
So Darian leaves, and then
your boyfriend comes over?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.050
Yeah.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.662
But he saw there were
three plates in the sink,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.752
knew Darian had just been here,
and he left.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.016
He just left because there
were three plates in the sink?

11:09.016 --> 11:11.540
Like I said,
he gets jealous of Darian.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.803
And how long did he stay?

11:13.803 --> 11:15.326
I don't know.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.850
Maybe ten minutes.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.985
We need to talk to Greg.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.770
Immediately.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.732
The guy was a pompous ass,

11:29.732 --> 11:31.908
always hanging
around my girlfriend.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.997
Couldn't just let her go,
live her life.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.825
They got a kid together.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.305
Yeah, I know.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.786
It wasn't just that.
It was his attitude too.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.223
He was always acting like he
was better than everyone else

11:42.223 --> 11:43.615
just because he was a doctor.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.226
- You see him last night?
- Whoa. Hold on.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.837
I didn't kill the guy if
that's what you're getting at.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.317
I didn't ask you that.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.362
Where'd you go after you
left your girlfriend's house?

11:51.362 --> 11:52.755
I came back here.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.409
Here?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.759
That's kind of late.
After 9:00?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.935
I sell security systems.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.937
Every night, I collect
all the data from the apps,

12:00.937 --> 12:03.331
the ones that report all
the local criminal activity,

12:03.331 --> 12:05.725
and I post the results
on social media.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.423
You report criminal activity
in this area?

12:08.423 --> 12:10.468
Things are
kind of tame around here.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.948
Not according to the apps.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.778
My orders have quadrupled
in the last three months.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.998
What can I say?
Fear's a powerful sales tactic.

12:17.998 --> 12:21.131
What can I say?
Alibis need verification.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.090
Sure.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.309
Three employees were
still working when I got here,

12:25.309 --> 12:26.658
plus,
I've got surveillance cameras

12:26.658 --> 12:28.530
inside and outside the office.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.708
Big surprise.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.624
We can cross Donnelly
off the list.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.234
He definitely was
at his office that night

12:37.234 --> 12:38.932
and didn't leave
till after midnight.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.237
Yeah, we checked on the posts
that he was talking about too.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.499
What kind of posts?

12:41.499 --> 12:42.936
There's these apps
that people use

12:42.936 --> 12:44.851
to report crimes in their area.
- My wife uses it.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.374
Checks out what's going on
in the neighborhood.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.810
Yeah,
so according to these apps,

12:47.810 --> 12:49.464
there was
three robberies reported

12:49.464 --> 12:52.119
in the vicinity
of Dr. Marshall's murder.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.685
We spoke to two of the vics.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.035
The first one,
bodega owner

12:55.035 --> 12:57.472
who accused a kid
of stealing a candy bar.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.605
The second one was
a 55-year-old divorceé

13:00.605 --> 13:03.347
who accused a Hispanic man
of looking at her funny.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.609
What about the third?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.263
Just found him,
and we're going there now.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.438
All right.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.397
Let's hope
third time's a charm.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.444
<i>What is this about?</i>

13:13.444 --> 13:16.360
Did you find
the guy who robbed me?

13:16.360 --> 13:18.188
No, we were actually hoping

13:18.188 --> 13:20.582
that you could shed some light
on the incident for us.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.627
I already told you
everything that I know.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.542
If you don't mind,
we'd like to go over it again.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.718
There's a possibility
that it's connected

13:26.718 --> 13:29.852
to a murder
that we're investigating.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.854
Murder?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.508
Really?

13:33.508 --> 13:37.033
We're not the robbery cops.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.863
Um, so...

13:40.863 --> 13:42.952
he approached me from behind.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.389
He asked for my phone,
my wallet.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.565
I give him both.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.741
And then, this guy,

13:49.741 --> 13:51.874
he cracks me over the head
with something.

13:51.874 --> 13:55.399
- Could it have been a bottle?
- Uh, yeah.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.880
Whatever it was, it knocked me
unconscious for a second.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.751
Do you remember
what this guy looked like?

13:59.751 --> 14:02.232
Maybe his height,
his weight, his race?

14:02.232 --> 14:06.410
Black. 5'7"-ish. Stocky.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.064
Approximate age?

14:08.064 --> 14:10.719
He's young. 18, 19.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.068
Do you remember anything
about his appearance?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.156
His clothing?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.071
Ski jacket.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.509
Some kind of wool cap.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.518
Mr. Burke, are you OK?

14:27.518 --> 14:29.172
Not really.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.438
It was traumatic, all right?

14:34.438 --> 14:37.615
I don't love reliving it.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.705
I thought
that I was gonna die, so...

14:40.705 --> 14:43.883
And I didn't know anything
about this recent tragedy.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.102
After what happened,
I don't really walk around

14:46.102 --> 14:47.364
after dark anymore.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.931
We understand.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.152
If that's all, I'd like
you guys to leave, please.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.156
Thank you.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.209
Hey, Lieu,
Brian Burke's robbery

15:06.209 --> 15:08.951
and Dr. Marshall's murder
could be connected.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.953
Both victims were approached
from behind,

15:10.953 --> 15:12.955
hit in the head
with blunt objects.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.696
They happened
in the same vicinity,

15:14.696 --> 15:16.132
around the same time of night.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.874
All right, let's check
the video and door cam footage

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
from the night
of Marshall's murder

15:20.484 --> 15:23.139
and see if anyone in the area
matches Burke's description.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.227
Done. Vi's on it.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.360
Hey.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

15:26.360 --> 15:27.622
Just come on in.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.189
Shut the door.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.150
- What's up?
- So I got a call

15:34.150 --> 15:37.458
from Wagner and Farley's
union rep today.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.547
Yeah.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.289
OK.
It was only a matter of time.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.160
What's he wanna do? Mediate?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.988
More like attack.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.599
Excuse me?

15:48.599 --> 15:50.079
He's coming for you.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.995
He said that you violated
departmental rules

15:52.995 --> 15:54.475
by refusing
to get on the ground.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.216
They said I...

15:56.216 --> 15:58.087
That lawyer can kiss my ass.
How about that?

15:58.087 --> 16:02.526
I would not be so quick
to dismiss that.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.701
You gotta trust me.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.052
I come
from a long line of cops,

16:06.052 --> 16:08.141
and I know exactly how
this thing is gonna play out.

16:08.141 --> 16:11.013
Lieu, those two cops
crossed the line.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.059
They wouldn't listen
to a word I was saying.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.365
They wouldn't
let me badge them.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.758
They had their guns drawn.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.629
They were practically
itching to light me up.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.935
It's your call.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.415
I just need to let you know
what's going on.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.374
And whatever you decide,
you've got my full support.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.724
You just have to understand

16:26.724 --> 16:29.553
what you're
stepping into right now.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.252
- What does that mean?
- Come on, Jalen.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.994
As much as I hate to admit it,
you know exactly how it works

16:34.994 --> 16:36.908
when a cop
goes after another cop.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.388
I'm not the bad guy here.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.826
Look, the department
is making so many changes,

16:41.826 --> 16:44.438
so many for the good,
but when it comes to this--

16:44.438 --> 16:45.569
this thing--

16:45.569 --> 16:48.050
we are stuck back in 1974.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.139
So it doesn't even matter
how right you are.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.880
And I know.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.013
I know you're right.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.150
This is the kind of thing that
is gonna destroy your career.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.676
OK.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.811
I get it.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.640
We're supposed
to protect each other, right?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.381
All those rah-rah speeches

17:14.381 --> 17:17.819
about being blue
and protecting your brother,

17:17.819 --> 17:19.734
they were written
by white guys.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.608
So you can tell
that union lawyer

17:24.608 --> 17:26.088
and those two white cops

17:26.088 --> 17:29.439
they are trying
to scare the wrong man.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.050
OK.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.355
I'm gonna call internal affairs

17:32.355 --> 17:34.662
and tell them
you're moving forward.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.057
Thank you.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.556
I've gone through
every shred of video

17:59.556 --> 18:01.384
from the night of the murder.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.994
I can't find anyone
who even remotely fits

18:02.994 --> 18:05.214
Burke's description
of the guy who robbed him.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.563
Worth a shot.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.739
I did find
something interesting, though.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.090
Surveillance video
from Burke's neighbor.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.700
Check it out.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.747
That's Burke.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.402
Taken around the time
of the murder, 10:04 p.m.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.274
- Play the video.
- Mm-hmm.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.452
His hands are shaking so much,

18:25.452 --> 18:27.845
he can barely
hold on to his keys.

18:32.198 --> 18:35.288
I thought you didn't go out
after dark anymore.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.159
- What are you--
- 'Cause we got a receipt

18:37.159 --> 18:39.857
that shows you purchased
a bottle of wine

18:39.857 --> 18:44.035
at a local liquor store
at 9:47 p.m.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.603
And there's a video of you
15 minutes later

18:46.603 --> 18:49.389
that puts you a block
from the crime scene,

18:49.389 --> 18:51.826
and you're not holding
a bottle of wine anymore.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.437
So the only question
I have for you now is,

18:54.437 --> 18:56.309
why did you do it?

18:56.309 --> 18:57.919
This is outrageous.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.791
My client is the victim
of a violent crime.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.619
Why don't you save
your outrage and indignation

19:02.619 --> 19:04.882
and just have your client
tell us what happened?

19:07.624 --> 19:10.975
Go ahead. Tell them.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.455
It was self-defense.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.461
You're saying he came to you.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.810
He approached me from behind,

19:19.810 --> 19:21.986
and he pretended
to ask for directions.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.597
And then, I turn around
to get a look at the guy,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.294
and I see he has something
in his hand, a gun,

19:25.294 --> 19:28.297
so I hit him over the head
with the only thing that I had,

19:28.297 --> 19:29.690
which was a wine bottle.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.213
And then,
you just fled the scene.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.128
- Yeah, I panicked.
- You didn't try to help him?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.608
Call 911?

19:34.608 --> 19:37.437
No, I ran home.
I called a lawyer.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.178
She said do nothing.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.092
I can verify that.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.703
Great advice, Counselor.

19:42.703 --> 19:46.097
You see, Darian Marshall...

19:46.097 --> 19:48.752
was really asking you
for directions.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.406
And he wasn't holding a gun.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.670
It was a cell phone.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.934
He was
a well-regarded heart surgeon,

19:56.934 --> 20:01.722
and you left him on the street
to die like an animal.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.943
No more questions.
We're done.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.688
- You believe him?
- I definitely don't think

20:11.688 --> 20:13.342
he set out
to kill anyone that night.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.691
That's for sure.
- Yeah.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.606
It doesn't mean
it was self-defense either.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.304
Let me call Price.
See what he thinks.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.653
Excuse me.

20:19.653 --> 20:23.047
Detective Shaw?
- Yeah.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.311
I'm Sergeant Frank Matthews,
Internal Affairs.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.529
You got a minute?

20:26.529 --> 20:28.705
Absolutely.
We can talk in here.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.972
Thank you for coming so soon.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.713
I know Lieutenant Dixon
just reached out to you,

20:36.713 --> 20:37.758
so I appreciate it.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.543
I'm not here about that.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.153
OK. What are you here for?

20:42.153 --> 20:45.548
Officers Wagner and Farley
filed a complaint against you.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.464
You're here
to investigate me?

20:48.464 --> 20:49.987
You can get in touch
with your union rep

20:49.987 --> 20:51.728
and consult an attorney
if you want.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.383
I don't need a lawyer.
I don't--

20:54.383 --> 20:56.733
The officers claim
they ordered you to the ground.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.300
They did, and I refused.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.085
I wasn't about
to get on my knees for anybody,

21:01.085 --> 21:02.609
much less those two cops.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.480
Now, you and I both know
what could have happened

21:04.480 --> 21:06.221
if I had complied.

21:06.221 --> 21:10.878
Look, sometimes
you have to let things slide.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.054
Keep an eye on the big picture.
- OK.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.361
I've had to put up with
a lot to get to where I am.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.102
If you drop your complaint,
I'm confident they will too.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.626
Right.

21:19.626 --> 21:21.628
I understand
what it feels like

21:21.628 --> 21:23.412
to be on the other end
of the nonsense.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.545
I do. Trust me.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.112
But let's face it,
nothing really happened.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.113
Nobody got hurt.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.680
So why make a big deal
about it,

21:30.680 --> 21:32.639
invite all kinds
of negative attention?

21:32.639 --> 21:35.163
This kind of thing
makes us look bad.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.040
Us?

21:45.260 --> 21:46.957
The police.

21:48.829 --> 21:49.873
Right.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.095
Price needs to see us.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.012
Thanks for making time, Sergeant.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.276
It's a tough one.

22:01.276 --> 22:04.497
I'm not quite sure
what the right charge is.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.502
I vote murder.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.721
Innocent man
is walking down the street,

22:11.721 --> 22:13.288
minding his own business.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.681
He gets bashed in the head.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.639
I'm not really sure
what we're discussing here.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
Well, Burke could have
a legitimate claim

22:18.380 --> 22:19.990
of self-defense.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.688
He can claim
whatever he wants.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.951
He was never
in any actual danger.

22:23.951 --> 22:27.084
And he left the man
bleeding in the street.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.913
He had recently been the
victim of a violent mugging

22:29.913 --> 22:31.045
in that same neighborhood.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.003
His assailant
hasn't been caught.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.919
A physically imposing man
he's never seen before...

22:35.919 --> 22:40.010
Physically imposing
Black man.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.534
Right?

22:44.885 --> 22:48.541
That approached him
for no apparent reason.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.194
He was in fear for his life,

22:50.194 --> 22:52.501
even though his fear turned out
to be unwarranted.

22:52.501 --> 22:53.894
I'm no lawyer,

22:53.894 --> 22:57.332
but doesn't that fear
have to be reasonable,

22:57.332 --> 23:01.249
you know, from a objective
person's perspective?

23:01.249 --> 23:02.685
Frank Cosgrove, Esq.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.687
But a jury might determine

23:04.687 --> 23:06.602
that Burke's fear
was reasonable.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.735
Reasonable?

23:10.084 --> 23:13.435
Nolan, softening the charges...

23:13.435 --> 23:15.916
ratifies what they did.

23:15.916 --> 23:20.573
I'm simply acknowledging
the weakness of a murder case.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.402
You're a lawyer.
You understand that.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.099
I was a lawyer.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.408
Now, I'm a cop.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.062
A Black cop.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.936
And unfortunately,
I just got yet another lesson

23:35.936 --> 23:37.590
in what that means,
and what that means is,

23:37.590 --> 23:38.895
when you're Black
in this country,

23:38.895 --> 23:42.595
you are guilty
in too many people's eyes.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.078
Burke made a false assumption

23:48.078 --> 23:50.211
based
on Dr. Marshall's skin color,

23:50.211 --> 23:51.995
and worse,
he acted on that assumption.

23:51.995 --> 23:55.390
And now, Dr. Marshall,
that Black doctor, is dead.

23:57.131 --> 24:00.613
If that is not enough
for a murder charge,

24:00.613 --> 24:02.919
I gotta start rethinking
how I'm spending my time

24:02.919 --> 24:04.530
risking my life
in the street with Frank

24:04.530 --> 24:07.271
to bring you good arrests just
to watch you water them down.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.851
Yes, I will.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.027
Phone won't stop ringing.

24:24.027 --> 24:27.378
CEOs, heads of charities,

24:27.378 --> 24:31.208
more than a handful
of political donors,

24:31.208 --> 24:35.343
all asking me to reconsider
indicting Brian Burke.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.736
Doesn't surprise me.
He chairs one

24:36.736 --> 24:39.347
of the biggest charitable
foundations in the city.

24:39.347 --> 24:42.393
Everyone says
he's a good man.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.439
Certainly not a racist.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.049
I'm not challenging
his character, Jack.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.921
I'm challenging his actions.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.662
I've weighed both sides
of the equation.

24:49.662 --> 24:53.143
Jalen Shaw made
a compelling case.

24:53.143 --> 24:56.538
You want to charge murder?

24:56.538 --> 24:58.409
Can you prove it?

24:58.409 --> 25:01.108
It'll be close,
but I have to try.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.283
Why is that?

25:02.283 --> 25:03.719
If I charge manslaughter,

25:03.719 --> 25:06.374
what kind of message
will I be sending?

25:06.374 --> 25:09.899
That you can assault
and kill Black men

25:09.899 --> 25:11.335
because you're scared?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.296
Burke's lawyer wants to meet.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.950
Says
she has additional information

25:16.950 --> 25:17.951
we need to consider.

25:21.389 --> 25:25.262
I know
that I should have called 911.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.395
Why didn't you?

25:27.395 --> 25:30.398
I panicked.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.619
I know how it looks,
but I'm not a racist.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.099
So what is this
additional information

25:36.099 --> 25:38.798
you want us to consider?

25:38.798 --> 25:41.278
On the, um--
the night of the--

25:41.278 --> 25:43.629
the incident with Dr. Marshall,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.500
I got an alert on my phone

25:45.500 --> 25:49.112
that there was a
suspicious person in the area.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.592
Who sent the alert?

25:50.592 --> 25:53.073
Well, it popped up
on a neighborhood safety app.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.857
What did it say?

25:54.857 --> 25:56.642
"Be careful.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.948
"There's a dangerous
Black man in the area.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.733
"He's armed.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.430
Exercise extreme caution."

26:02.430 --> 26:04.606
Did the alert
provide a description?

26:04.606 --> 26:06.347
A little more than that.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.437
It provided a picture
of Dr. Marshall.

26:12.658 --> 26:16.792
So Burke actually
might be telling the truth.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.012
That's definitely
Dr. Marshall.

26:19.012 --> 26:22.798
Yeah, and these are
the posts that Burke saw.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.540
The first one says, "A tall
Black man just mugged someone.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.674
The mugger is armed
and extremely dangerous."

26:28.674 --> 26:31.198
Dozens of people
post comments after that.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.940
Another woman says
that they saw Dr. Marshall,

26:33.940 --> 26:35.985
and she is sure
that he's got a gun.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.248
Then the story
takes on a life of its own.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.033
It's like a dangerous
fearmongering version

26:40.033 --> 26:41.121
of telephone.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.383
Who started it?

26:42.383 --> 26:44.428
A man named Daniel Deluca.

26:44.428 --> 26:47.736
52. Works in real estate.
Lives downtown.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.652
And he's done
this sort of thing before.

26:50.652 --> 26:51.871
What do you mean?

26:51.871 --> 26:54.482
Well, he's posted
that violent people,

26:54.482 --> 26:57.006
usually Black men,
are on certain streets.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.573
He puts up photos.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.705
And then, he makes up stories

26:59.705 --> 27:01.881
about them
with guns and knives.

27:01.881 --> 27:04.144
He gets the residents
all riled up.

27:04.144 --> 27:08.191
And then, inevitably, a chain
of racist rumors follows.

27:08.191 --> 27:12.108
And the posts turn out
to be pure fiction.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.894
- Has anyone else been hurt?
- Yeah.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.592
One man was assaulted
by an angry mob of residents,

27:17.592 --> 27:20.073
and two Black men
were falsely arrested.

27:20.073 --> 27:22.989
Brooke's lawyers
could wind up calling Deluca

27:22.989 --> 27:24.817
to support
their self-defense claim.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.732
I wanna be prepared
to cross-examine him.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.473
I look forward
to meeting this guy.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.002
I don't know
what to tell you.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.221
I was walking through
the meatpacking district,

27:38.221 --> 27:40.006
meeting my girlfriend
for a late dinner.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.747
I saw a guy
who looked suspicious.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.618
What made him
look suspicious?

27:43.618 --> 27:45.925
I thought he had a gun.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.536
Those people,
coming into our neighborhood,

27:48.536 --> 27:51.626
ruining it for the rest of us.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.585
Those people?

27:54.585 --> 27:57.458
What do you mean by that?

27:57.458 --> 28:00.504
You know, criminals.

28:00.504 --> 28:03.986
So you think you're doing
some kind of a public service?

28:03.986 --> 28:05.205
Actually, I do.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.164
Plus, I've got three kids,
elderly parents.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.383
No one is safe anymore.

28:09.383 --> 28:12.299
You--

28:12.299 --> 28:14.736
you're out of line.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.912
You can't just go around
posting whatever you want.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.436
That's dangerous. Reckless.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.917
You're practically
asking somebody

28:21.917 --> 28:24.964
to take the law
into their own hands,

28:24.964 --> 28:27.227
maybe even commit
an act of violence.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.710
Turn around.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.018
You heard him.
Turn around. Turn around.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.803
Come on. Come on.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.805
Hands behind your back.

28:39.805 --> 28:44.113
Daniel Deluca,
you're under arrest.

28:44.113 --> 28:45.375
What for?

28:45.375 --> 28:46.986
Manslaughter.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.773
I'm assuming
you ran this by Price.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.137
You arrested Daniel Deluca?

29:08.137 --> 29:09.269
Charged him with manslaughter?

29:09.269 --> 29:10.749
Good to see you, Price.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.099
We're on solid footing
with that.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.449
Deluca's actions
were the direct cause

29:15.449 --> 29:16.798
of Dr. Marshall's murder.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.844
Didn't think
to consult with me first?

29:18.844 --> 29:21.760
We have initial discretion
to make the arrest, Nolan.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.805
There were
no exigent circumstances.

29:23.805 --> 29:24.893
Have a seat.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.242
You wanna play prosecutor,

29:26.242 --> 29:27.548
join the DA's office.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.811
Otherwise, stay in your lane.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.813
Mm. Well,
you don't wanna charge Deluca,

29:31.813 --> 29:32.814
that's on you, buddy.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.163
We got a good case.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.469
Not so sure about that.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.558
And we'd have to flip Burke.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.125
Well, let's flip him then.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.127
You're the one who urged me
to charge him with murder.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.477
And I stand by that, but new
information has come to light

29:43.477 --> 29:45.218
that says
that Deluca is more culpable.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.828
He incited Burke.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.787
He made the guy
feel like he was in danger.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.005
But for Deluca's post,

29:50.005 --> 29:52.094
Dr. Marshall
would still be alive today.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.835
I get it,
but Burke is the one

29:53.835 --> 29:55.532
who smashed him in the head
with a wine bottle.

29:55.532 --> 29:59.667
Yes, and Deluca's
reckless posts made him do it.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.712
He has to be held
accountable for that.

30:05.716 --> 30:09.024
Is there any way
you can prove both cases?

30:09.024 --> 30:10.896
Try Burke and Deluca together?

30:10.896 --> 30:14.160
I need Burke's cooperation
to win against Deluca.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.510
You can prove
Deluca was reckless,

30:16.510 --> 30:18.860
that he created
a dangerous situation

30:18.860 --> 30:21.689
and put Marshall's life
in jeopardy

30:21.689 --> 30:23.778
with evidence
of his past behavior.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.780
But that's
only half the battle.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.522
I need Burke
to say he saw the posts

30:28.522 --> 30:31.873
and that he believed
what was in them.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.875
Then get him a deal.
Get him on board.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.531
OK, but I'd be sacrificing
the murder case against Burke

30:37.531 --> 30:39.881
for a much weaker case
against Deluca.

30:39.881 --> 30:43.537
Opportunity and risk
come in pairs.

30:43.537 --> 30:48.194
If you think Deluca
was the most responsible,

30:48.194 --> 30:50.587
set your sights on him.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.290
Mr. Burke,
you're here as part

30:57.290 --> 30:59.248
of a cooperation agreement?
- That's true.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.554
In exchange
for your testimony,

31:00.554 --> 31:02.469
you'll receive
a seven-year sentence.

31:02.469 --> 31:05.167
Yes. I will plead guilty
to manslaughter.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.214
Tell the members of the jury,

31:08.214 --> 31:11.434
why did you kill
Dr. Darian Marshall?

31:11.434 --> 31:14.263
Because I thought
that he was going to kill me.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.743
Did you believe
he had a weapon?

31:15.743 --> 31:16.918
A gun, yes.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.267
Why did you think this?

31:18.267 --> 31:21.183
Because the defendant
put things on an app.

31:21.183 --> 31:24.143
You're referring to
the defendant, Daniel Deluca?

31:24.143 --> 31:25.927
Yes.

31:25.927 --> 31:29.235
I believed what he posted.

31:29.235 --> 31:33.500
I thought that I was in danger,
and I was protecting myself.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.589
Thank you.
Nothing further.

31:39.985 --> 31:44.728
My client
didn't kill Darian Marshall.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.513
You did.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.602
Regrettably, yes.

31:48.602 --> 31:52.519
You took a bottle,
smashed it over his head,

31:52.519 --> 31:55.609
and left him to die.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.437
I wish I could take it back.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.265
And so, you're doing
the next best thing,

31:59.265 --> 32:00.962
trying to blame someone else.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.442
Objection. Argumentative.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.096
Overruled.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.836
You killed someone,

32:05.836 --> 32:07.490
and then you got
a sweetheart deal

32:07.490 --> 32:09.362
from a prosecutor
who is hellbent

32:09.362 --> 32:10.798
on making
a political statement.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.105
Your Honor.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.107
Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.239
You're excused, sir.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.806
Call your next witness,
Mr. Price.

32:18.806 --> 32:22.679
People call
Detective Jalen Shaw.

32:22.679 --> 32:26.727
The defendant started
a chain of racist messages

32:26.727 --> 32:30.687
and then posted
a picture of Dr. Marshall.

32:30.687 --> 32:33.255
Has the defendant made
postings like this in the past?

32:33.255 --> 32:34.822
Yes.

32:34.822 --> 32:38.391
Men--Black men--
walking down the street,

32:38.391 --> 32:41.872
minding their own business
are the targets of these posts?

32:41.872 --> 32:43.352
Correct.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.789
And some of these innocent
men have been arrested,

32:45.789 --> 32:48.792
and one has actually
been assaulted?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.925
Yes, he was
punched in the head

32:50.925 --> 32:54.494
and then hospitalized
for a concussion.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.712
Thank you.

32:59.412 --> 33:03.068
Detective, are you aware
that the NYPD uses these apps

33:03.068 --> 33:06.027
to fight crimes
and put out police alerts?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.507
Objection. Relevance.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.943
What is the relevance?

33:08.943 --> 33:11.554
This is a case
about free speech

33:11.554 --> 33:13.992
and civic participation.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.690
They should be giving my client
a medal for citizenship.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.648
Not being put on trial
for homicide.

33:18.648 --> 33:21.564
Objection is overruled.

33:21.564 --> 33:24.828
Counselor, I'm aware
that the NYPD is using...

33:24.828 --> 33:27.048
certain crime-fighting apps.

33:27.048 --> 33:31.183
And when these apps are used
in a responsible manner,

33:31.183 --> 33:33.750
they can be a useful tool.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.884
Problems arise
when they're used recklessly.

33:36.884 --> 33:39.191
You know a lot about
recklessness Detective Shaw,

33:39.191 --> 33:40.279
don't you?

33:40.279 --> 33:41.584
Objection. Argumentative.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.412
Ask another question,
Miss Stanley.

33:43.412 --> 33:48.200
Violating NYPD rules and
regulations is also reckless,

33:48.200 --> 33:50.028
isn't it?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.812
It depends
on the circumstances.

33:51.812 --> 33:54.597
Detective Shaw,
is there a pending

33:54.597 --> 33:56.904
Internal Affairs complaint
against you?

34:00.299 --> 34:03.867
There's one pending, yes.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.305
You violated
your department's policy.

34:06.305 --> 34:11.310
You failed to comply with the
request of a fellow officer?

34:11.310 --> 34:13.703
That is the allegation.

34:13.703 --> 34:18.186
So your own department
has taken action against you.

34:18.186 --> 34:20.188
It has.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.930
And the underlying incident
involves a dispute

34:22.930 --> 34:26.760
that you had
with white police officers.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.805
I was racially profiled.

34:28.805 --> 34:32.331
And charging my client,
a white man, with homicide,

34:32.331 --> 34:34.768
that's your way of
balancing the scales, isn't it?

34:34.768 --> 34:37.249
- Objection.
- Sustained.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.642
Nothing further.

34:39.642 --> 34:43.820
Detective Shaw,
you're excused.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.083
Yeah.

34:56.311 --> 34:59.009
You're the subject of an
Internal Affairs complaint?

34:59.009 --> 35:00.968
- It's complete nonsense.
- That's not the point.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.405
If you had told me,
I would have been prepared.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.624
I would have never
put you on the stand.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.496
OK. He screwed up.
Let's move on.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.152
What do you need?

35:11.152 --> 35:13.328
Deluca is going
to testify tomorrow morning.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.417
The defense has put us
back on our heels,

35:15.417 --> 35:17.245
and at the same time,
they're selling Deluca

35:17.245 --> 35:18.986
as some well-intentioned guy

35:18.986 --> 35:21.119
who bears no responsibility
for what happened.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.381
We need to disprove that.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.165
His posts are part
of a pattern of conduct.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.645
We can get you
police reports,

35:25.645 --> 35:29.127
medical records that show
his past posts hurt people.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.563
I need more.
I need evidence

35:30.563 --> 35:32.782
of his motive, his state
of mind, that he is racist.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.915
I've been looking through
his social media accounts.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.569
He doesn't belong
to any white supremacy groups

35:36.569 --> 35:38.527
or any other
fringe organizations.

35:38.527 --> 35:41.922
And he's never posted anything
that's scandalous or racist.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.967
Well, what kind of things
does he post?

35:43.967 --> 35:45.447
Mostly real estate stuff.

35:45.447 --> 35:48.494
It looks like he buys
and sells apartments.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.588
Is anybody else
noticing something similar

35:55.588 --> 35:57.677
about all these addresses?

35:59.505 --> 36:01.420
That can't be just
a coincidence.

36:06.947 --> 36:11.169
My goal is to help
my fellow New Yorkers.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.214
I wanna make a difference,

36:13.214 --> 36:15.173
reclaim the streets
from the criminals

36:15.173 --> 36:16.870
that have taken over
this great city.

36:16.870 --> 36:21.918
You had no control over
Mr. Burke's actions, did you?

36:21.918 --> 36:26.227
My heart goes out
to Dr. Marshall's family.

36:26.227 --> 36:30.884
But I had no idea
anyone would die.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.323
Thank you.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.543
You're in the real estate
business, correct?

36:37.543 --> 36:40.676
You buy and sell apartments?
- Yes.

36:40.676 --> 36:45.203
Crime, or reports of crime,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.553
can drive down the value

36:47.553 --> 36:51.252
of buildings
in a particular neighborhood,

36:51.252 --> 36:53.167
can't it?

36:53.167 --> 36:55.996
It can.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.781
You've been planting false
reports of criminal activity

36:58.781 --> 37:01.175
in order to decrease
the value of homes

37:01.175 --> 37:02.394
in certain neighborhoods,
haven't you?

37:02.394 --> 37:04.526
Price tags go down,

37:04.526 --> 37:05.962
you purchase properties,
and eventually,

37:05.962 --> 37:07.834
when the neighborhood
is seen as safe again,

37:07.834 --> 37:12.360
you sell the property
and make a hefty profit.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.580
Objection.
Facts not in evidence.

37:14.580 --> 37:19.237
Well, then allow me
to give an offer of proof.

37:19.237 --> 37:24.546
A certified report from the New
York City Register's Office.

37:24.546 --> 37:29.638
Four transactions
in the past two years.

37:29.638 --> 37:33.338
I'll accept the offer. Proceed.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.775
You issued...

37:35.775 --> 37:41.084
several fictitious posts
about Black criminals

37:41.084 --> 37:44.740
on streets where each of
these properties were located.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.395
Each of these posts
described a man

37:47.395 --> 37:50.529
as armed, dangerous,
acting erratic.

37:50.529 --> 37:51.921
I'm not sure about that.

37:51.921 --> 37:56.012
Well, then let me help
refresh your memory.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.058
You do recognize these posts?

38:01.366 --> 38:02.584
I guess.

38:02.584 --> 38:07.502
And then,
within a matter of weeks,

38:07.502 --> 38:11.941
you purchased the apartment.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.074
You made a killing,
didn't you, Mr. Deluca?

38:14.074 --> 38:16.294
- Objection.
- Overruled.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.426
Answer the question, sir.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.953
I'm a businessman.

38:23.953 --> 38:26.478
I made a profit.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.567
Thank you.
That's all I have.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.473
Madame Foreperson,
has the jury reached a verdict?

39:05.473 --> 39:07.475
We have, Your Honor.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.998
How do you find?

39:08.998 --> 39:11.653
We find the defendant
guilty of manslaughter

39:11.653 --> 39:13.960
in the first degree.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.789
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.094
You are excused.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.879
Court is in recess.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.517
Congratulations.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.780
Sometimes we get it right.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.522
But something tells me
that's not why you're here.

39:54.522 --> 39:58.047
Nope. I just got a call.

39:58.047 --> 40:01.355
Internal Affairs
is closing the investigation.

40:01.355 --> 40:02.835
Closing it?

40:02.835 --> 40:06.621
They found your allegations
to be unsubstantiated.

40:06.621 --> 40:11.234
I wish I could say
I was surprised, but...

40:11.234 --> 40:13.802
And what about
their allegations against me?

40:13.802 --> 40:16.326
That complaint stuck.

40:16.326 --> 40:20.069
They're suspending you
for a week without pay.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.812
Look, Jalen,

40:23.812 --> 40:26.772
I have seen positive changes
in the department,

40:26.772 --> 40:30.253
but the blue wall
is still the blue wall.
