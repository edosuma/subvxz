WEBVTT

00:11.755 --> 00:13.122
Are they still back there?

00:13.124 --> 00:14.824
Still there.

00:14.826 --> 00:16.592
How did they find us?

00:16.594 --> 00:18.594
They pay off people
to spy for them.

00:18.596 --> 00:22.348
Kids, shopkeepers,
even the police.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.966
So it could've been anyone.

00:23.968 --> 00:26.052
We're not safe anywhere.

00:49.275 --> 00:50.743
Quick, pull in here.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.581
Kill the lights.

01:09.847 --> 01:11.847
Okay, so what's the plan?

01:13.850 --> 01:16.936
I'm gonna draw them off you,
off the car.

01:16.938 --> 01:20.272
Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower,
you know where that is?

01:20.274 --> 01:22.108
I can find it.

01:22.909 --> 01:24.860
We'll meet there in an hour.

01:25.829 --> 01:27.446
Adam, wait.

01:32.285 --> 01:33.786
You promise?

01:33.788 --> 01:35.487
Yeah.

01:35.489 --> 01:37.289
Yeah, I promise.

01:42.262 --> 01:45.497
I love you, Kono.

01:45.499 --> 01:47.666
I love you, too.

02:07.205 --> 02:09.205
Adam, run.

02:09.207 --> 02:11.340
Adam, what are you doing?

02:11.342 --> 02:13.509
Get out of there.

03:04.210 --> 03:07.513
And I've lost visual again.
Well, luckily,

03:07.515 --> 03:09.565
audio's alive and well.
I don't know, Billy.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.517
I don't think
Sandra Cutler's gonna need

03:11.519 --> 03:13.423
this much evidence
of her husband's infidelity.

03:13.424 --> 03:14.840
You know,

03:14.842 --> 03:16.675
a simple still photo
of those two kissing

03:16.677 --> 03:18.174
would probably be enough
to convince her.

03:18.199 --> 03:18.812
Hey,

03:18.813 --> 03:20.879
she paid us to get the truth;
that's exactly what we're doing.

03:20.881 --> 03:22.515
What she does with
it is her business.

03:23.483 --> 03:25.568
How long have we been
sitting here, anyway?

03:25.570 --> 03:30.106
Three very long... hours.

03:31.492 --> 03:32.992
My butt is totally numb.

03:35.062 --> 03:37.580
Well, what about me? I drank
four bottles of coconut water.

03:37.582 --> 03:40.783
Well, I warned you.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.536
Dehydration is your friend
on a stakeout.

03:43.538 --> 03:45.337
You know, you can use
one of the empties in the back

03:45.339 --> 03:47.256
if you really can't hold it.

03:47.258 --> 03:48.791
It's nothing
I haven't seen before, so...

03:48.793 --> 03:50.342
I am a trained
SEAL, Rollins.

03:50.344 --> 03:51.627
I think I can hold it.

03:52.412 --> 03:54.013
Besides,

03:54.015 --> 03:55.747
it looks like
they're finishing up.

03:55.749 --> 03:58.551
Good, 'cause I want to go
home and take a shower.

03:58.553 --> 04:00.386
Maybe bleach my brain

04:00.388 --> 04:02.471
to rid myself of the image

04:02.473 --> 04:05.024
of naked John Cutler
and his girlfriend.

04:05.026 --> 04:06.892
Hey, you're not gonna quit
on me, are you?

04:06.894 --> 04:08.927
What? Where did that come from?

04:08.929 --> 04:10.596
It's just, when I
offered you this job,

04:10.598 --> 04:14.066
I promised you
an exciting post-navy life.

04:14.068 --> 04:15.367
World travel,

04:15.369 --> 04:16.601
intelligence gathering.

04:16.603 --> 04:17.870
Last week, we protected

04:17.872 --> 04:19.238
a foreign national.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.906
Yeah, and this week,
you're a Peeping Tom.

04:20.908 --> 04:21.940
I'm gonna think of it

04:21.942 --> 04:24.493
as practicing
my surveillance skills.

04:26.713 --> 04:28.797
That's a wrap, folks.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.049
We'll just hang out here
a few more minutes

04:30.051 --> 04:31.467
for him to leave.

04:31.469 --> 04:32.801
And then we'll head out.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.470
Before I drop you off,
you want to hit

04:34.472 --> 04:35.754
the Wailana for some pancakes?

04:35.756 --> 04:37.039
Sounds good.

04:45.348 --> 04:46.682
What is that about?

04:48.818 --> 04:50.419
Billy, he's got a gun.

04:52.072 --> 04:53.989
What did you forget?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.583
Drop your weapon!

05:13.710 --> 05:15.211
Catherine!

05:15.213 --> 05:17.429
I'm all right.

05:25.305 --> 05:27.806
Billy!

05:27.808 --> 05:28.974
It's okay.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.811
Let me see. Hang in there.

05:33.813 --> 05:36.065
Stay with me.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.984
You're not
gonna die today!

05:38.986 --> 05:40.352
You hear me?
You hear me?

Hey! Billy, stay with me.

06:18.859 --> 06:20.159
I'm not going anywhere.

06:20.910 --> 06:24.496
You wanted
more excitement, right?

06:25.782 --> 06:28.834
This isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

06:45.218 --> 06:48.137
Got a GSW to the stomach.

06:48.139 --> 06:49.421
He's O-neg.

06:49.423 --> 06:51.523
You're injured, too.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

06:51.525 --> 06:52.608
Get him into trauma one.

06:52.610 --> 06:53.892
Get two large bore IVs in him

06:53.894 --> 06:55.427
and hang saline.

06:55.429 --> 06:56.895
He's lost a lot of blood.

06:56.897 --> 06:58.430
Initiate massive
transfusion protocol

06:58.432 --> 07:00.032
and let's get him intubated.

07:02.602 --> 07:05.287
Get her into the ER now.
Get her to trauma two.

07:19.669 --> 07:21.053
Late-night tune-up?

07:21.055 --> 07:22.421
Hey.

07:22.423 --> 07:25.424
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
switching out the plugs.

07:25.426 --> 07:29.928
You know, I hear you can pay
somebody to do that for you.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.680
What are you, crazy?

07:31.682 --> 07:33.682
You think I'm gonna
let some know-nothing

07:33.684 --> 07:37.152
grease monkey get his hands
on a classic like this?

07:37.154 --> 07:40.606
Your dad felt the same
way about this car.

07:40.608 --> 07:42.941
And that was before
it was a classic,

07:42.943 --> 07:44.576
when it was just old.

07:46.112 --> 07:47.413
Don't overtighten.

07:47.415 --> 07:48.580
I got this.

07:50.117 --> 07:51.533
Thanks for coming by.

07:51.535 --> 07:54.036
Sounded like
it might be important.

07:54.038 --> 07:57.456
Kind of hoping
you could tell me.

07:57.458 --> 08:01.009
Well, how long have you
been trying to reach her?

08:01.011 --> 08:02.594
A couple weeks.

08:02.596 --> 08:03.929
No luck.

08:03.931 --> 08:06.965
Well, your mother is
a difficult person to pin down.

08:06.967 --> 08:09.435
I really need to speak with her.

08:09.437 --> 08:12.838
I was kind of hoping
maybe you could get in touch.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.356
What makes you think
she'll answer my call?

08:14.358 --> 08:16.809
Because you're not asking
any difficult questions.

08:16.811 --> 08:19.528
Steve, if Doris knows
you're looking for information

08:19.530 --> 08:21.313
about her relationship
with Wo Fat...

08:21.315 --> 08:23.482
She's gonna avoid me
as long as she can.

08:24.317 --> 08:26.184
But if she's off the grid,

08:26.186 --> 08:27.786
it could also be for reasons

08:27.788 --> 08:30.322
that have nothing
to do with you.

08:32.158 --> 08:34.192
I mean...

08:34.193 --> 08:37.212
You know something
you're not telling me here, Joe?

08:37.214 --> 08:38.580
No, I'm just reminding you

08:38.582 --> 08:40.832
your mother's
a complicated woman.

08:40.835 --> 08:43.085
But I will reach out.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.203
I will see what I can find.

08:45.205 --> 08:46.755
Okay.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.341
McGarrett.

08:50.143 --> 08:53.061
Yes.

08:53.063 --> 08:56.014
Where are they?

09:16.736 --> 09:18.754
Hey.

09:20.123 --> 09:21.957
Hey.

09:26.464 --> 09:28.514
Where am I?

09:28.516 --> 09:31.350
You're in the hospital.

09:33.136 --> 09:35.354
Just-just take
it easy, okay?

09:43.429 --> 09:45.898
Do you remember
what happened, Catherine?

09:45.900 --> 09:48.150
You and Billy were
on a stakeout.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.154
Mm.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.572
Yeah, we were.

09:53.574 --> 09:55.874
We, um...

09:55.876 --> 09:57.993
We got what we needed,

09:57.995 --> 10:00.746
and, uh, we started
breaking down the equipment.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.450
And then... and then I saw...

10:05.452 --> 10:07.886
Oh, God, Billy.

10:07.888 --> 10:11.089
Is he all right?

10:16.729 --> 10:19.481
Steve?

10:21.300 --> 10:23.101
He's gone.

10:23.103 --> 10:25.354
He, um...

10:25.356 --> 10:28.290
he coded on the table, and
they couldn't revive him.

10:28.292 --> 10:32.143
I'm so sorry, Catherine.

10:33.613 --> 10:35.747
But...

10:53.016 --> 10:55.100
I'm so sorry.

11:16.873 --> 11:19.374
Boss said you wanted to see me.

11:22.879 --> 11:25.530
This man's name
is William Harrington.

11:25.532 --> 11:29.151
Former Lieutenant Commander
SEAL Team 7.

11:29.153 --> 11:30.919
He saw action in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

11:30.921 --> 11:34.723
He served his country with
courage and distinction.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.411
I'll take good care of him, sir.

11:40.747 --> 11:43.899
I'm sure you will.

11:43.901 --> 11:48.236
I just wanted you
to know who he is.

11:54.226 --> 11:55.494
What are you doing?
You can't pull that out.

11:55.496 --> 11:57.062
Wait a minute.
Now listen to me.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.898
I checked John Cutler's pulse
before I got Billy into the car.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.500
He was already dead.

12:01.502 --> 12:03.035
My phone was in
the back of the van,

12:03.037 --> 12:05.754
and I was so hell-bent on
getting Billy here that I forgot

12:05.756 --> 12:07.422
to call HPD about the cabin.

12:07.424 --> 12:08.790
We need to get
back there now

12:08.792 --> 12:10.008
because it's
a crime scene.

12:10.010 --> 12:11.460
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Stop.

12:11.462 --> 12:12.911
You need to stay here

12:12.913 --> 12:14.513
and you need to rest,
you understand, okay?

12:14.515 --> 12:16.048
I'm gonna call Duke.
I'll call HPD

12:16.050 --> 12:17.799
and get a CSU team
to the cabin.

12:17.801 --> 12:19.267
Okay, good, but I'm going, too.

12:19.269 --> 12:21.803
No, Catherine, you're not going.
You've been shot.

12:21.805 --> 12:24.973
Steve, Billy's killer
is out there, okay?

12:24.975 --> 12:26.441
And I can't be in here.

12:26.443 --> 12:29.611
And you of all people
should understand that.

12:42.325 --> 12:44.442
Duke, what's
going on here?

12:44.444 --> 12:45.711
Why isn't your team
inside processing?

12:45.713 --> 12:47.412
Better if you see for yourself.

13:05.332 --> 13:07.849
Steve, there was blood here.

13:10.469 --> 13:12.354
This doesn't make any sense.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.856
Look, you've been
through a lot, okay?

13:14.858 --> 13:17.826
Is there any chance
you got the address wrong?

13:17.828 --> 13:19.745
I was unconscious
for hours.

13:19.747 --> 13:21.613
Somebody came in here
during that time

13:21.615 --> 13:22.781
and scrubbed this place.

13:22.783 --> 13:23.815
Catherine.

13:26.036 --> 13:29.955
Look, John Cutler's body
was right here.

13:34.962 --> 13:36.595
You smell that?

13:36.597 --> 13:37.662
Okay, that's bleach.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.598
It's a kitchen floor, Catherine.

13:49.609 --> 13:52.611
Huh. They painted over
the blood spatter.

13:52.613 --> 13:54.780
They mopped the floors,
everything.

13:54.782 --> 13:56.031
All the evidence
that John Cutler

13:56.033 --> 13:58.483
was ever here,
they took away.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.185
Look, I know I'm right.

14:01.287 --> 14:03.121
Duke, get the CSU team in here,

14:03.123 --> 14:05.490
process this house, all right?

14:05.492 --> 14:06.524
Then process
the surrounding woods.

14:06.526 --> 14:07.492
Two people were murdered;

14:07.494 --> 14:08.693
there's got to be
evidence of that.

14:08.695 --> 14:09.661
You got it.

14:09.663 --> 14:11.797
We'll find it.

14:22.766 --> 14:25.618
When did Sandra Cutler hire you
and Billy to tail her husband?

14:25.620 --> 14:26.819
Four days ago.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.576
She thought he was having
an affair,

14:28.578 --> 14:30.044
and she was right.
That's motive.

14:30.046 --> 14:32.213
And what if she already knew
he was cheating,

14:32.215 --> 14:34.933
she's gets a hired gun,
you and Billy are her alibi?

14:34.935 --> 14:37.268
I put an APB
out on Cutler's car.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.304
I also pinged his cell phone
in case it was

14:39.306 --> 14:40.855
still on the body.
No signal.

14:41.285 --> 14:42.785
Whoever
cleaned the cabin

14:42.787 --> 14:44.186
got rid of the car
and destroyed the phone.

14:44.188 --> 14:45.738
Yeah, that fits with
what CSU is telling me.

14:45.740 --> 14:47.456
The place is spotless.

14:47.458 --> 14:50.292
No prints, casings or shells
inside or out.

14:50.294 --> 14:52.044
There were traces of blood
in the living room,

14:52.046 --> 14:53.579
but they were too contaminated
to test.

14:53.581 --> 14:55.364
So we've got nothing?

14:55.366 --> 14:56.799
We do have this.

14:58.218 --> 15:00.836
Set of tire tracks consistent
with a commercial van.

15:00.838 --> 15:02.537
Okay, if they're
the only tracks

15:02.539 --> 15:05.207
at the scene of the crime, then
the van belonged to our cleaner.

15:05.209 --> 15:07.142
Yeah, the shooter drove
a sedan.

15:07.144 --> 15:09.711
After he left, he must've called
in the cleanup.

15:09.713 --> 15:11.680
All right, well, let's see
if we can locate the van.

15:11.682 --> 15:12.648
What about the cabin?

15:12.650 --> 15:13.932
Do we know who owns the cabin?

15:13.934 --> 15:15.267
Maybe there's a connection
there to Cutler.

15:15.269 --> 15:17.936
Yeah, a couple from Iowa
keep it as a vacation rental,

15:17.938 --> 15:20.155
and Cutler rented it out
for the night

15:20.157 --> 15:21.690
through a Kahiku
Management Company.

15:21.692 --> 15:23.826
He had been using
it a lot

15:23.828 --> 15:24.893
over the past few months,

15:24.895 --> 15:26.328
probably to meet up
with this woman.

15:26.330 --> 15:29.898
I was able to isolate
a screen shot of her.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.566
Who is she?

15:31.568 --> 15:33.068
Her name is Abby Maxwell.

15:33.070 --> 15:35.788
She advertises herself online
as a "companion."

15:35.790 --> 15:38.006
She charges a grand an hour.

15:38.008 --> 15:39.391
Cash only.

15:39.393 --> 15:41.910
I went through Cutler's finances
with a fine-tooth comb.

15:41.912 --> 15:44.079
The girl, the cabin--
he didn't have

15:44.081 --> 15:45.297
that kind of cash
available.

15:45.299 --> 15:48.083
So where's he getting
his money?

15:49.969 --> 15:52.721
<i>Mrs. Cutler,</i>

15:52.723 --> 15:54.973
can you think of any reason
why anybody would want

15:54.975 --> 15:56.308
to kill your husband?

15:56.310 --> 15:57.476
Did he have
any problems at work?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.261
Anybody there he didn't
get along with?

15:59.263 --> 16:02.981
John repaired and upgraded
the office computers.

16:02.983 --> 16:04.199
Whenever the system crashed,

16:04.201 --> 16:06.235
John could always get it
back online.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.204
People were happy to see him.

16:10.990 --> 16:13.041
Sandra, when you first
hired Billy and me,

16:13.043 --> 16:15.494
you said it was because
John had been

16:15.496 --> 16:17.246
acting strangely.

16:17.248 --> 16:19.715
What was the first thing
you noticed that was different?

16:19.717 --> 16:24.219
He put an encryption code
on his laptop,

16:24.221 --> 16:26.455
locking me out.

16:26.457 --> 16:27.973
You assumed
it was another woman.

16:27.975 --> 16:30.426
Is there any chance it could
have been something else?

16:30.428 --> 16:33.462
I honestly have no idea.

16:35.398 --> 16:37.599
We'd like to take
the laptop if we can.

16:37.601 --> 16:39.234
Maybe we can crack the code.

16:39.236 --> 16:42.354
And if we can, maybe we'll find
some answers in there.

16:47.193 --> 16:48.243
May I help you?

16:48.245 --> 16:49.445
I'm here to see Abby Maxwell.

16:49.447 --> 16:50.746
I'm afraid she's with a client.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.448
Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly,

16:52.450 --> 16:53.815
Five-O.

16:53.817 --> 16:56.151
Tell her I'm here to talk about
last night's client.

16:56.153 --> 16:57.619
This is crazy.

16:57.621 --> 16:59.872
If I had stayed at that cabin
another ten minutes...

16:59.874 --> 17:01.423
Did his wife do it?

17:01.425 --> 17:03.842
He always said she'd kill him
if she found out.

17:03.844 --> 17:05.661
Right now, everyone
in John Cutler's life

17:05.663 --> 17:06.962
is a person of interest.

17:06.964 --> 17:10.048
Look, I just launched this firm,

17:10.050 --> 17:12.917
and I'm not exactly pulling in
the big commissions yet.

17:12.920 --> 17:17.306
So I go on a couple dates
a month...

17:17.308 --> 17:19.273
just to pay my rent.

17:19.276 --> 17:22.611
It's not like
I'm a criminal or anything.

17:22.613 --> 17:24.179
Actually, Abby,
according to the law,

17:24.181 --> 17:25.731
that's exactly what you are.

17:25.733 --> 17:29.351
Well, for what it's worth,
after this, I'm done.

17:29.353 --> 17:30.903
I'm getting out.

17:30.905 --> 17:33.155
Of course I'll cooperate,
but if we could just

17:33.157 --> 17:34.990
keep this between us?

17:34.992 --> 17:36.825
How often
did you and Cutler meet?

17:36.827 --> 17:38.660
For a while, maybe once a month.

17:38.662 --> 17:39.745
That's strange.

17:39.747 --> 17:41.046
We went through his phone logs,

17:41.048 --> 17:43.865
both home and cell--
your number isn't there.

17:43.867 --> 17:47.369
He said he got
a special phone just for me.

17:49.138 --> 17:51.006
See for your yourself.

17:53.209 --> 17:54.593
Hey, monkey, listen,
I got to go,

17:54.595 --> 17:56.762
but I want you
to break a leg, all right?

17:56.764 --> 17:57.963
Ooh, wait a minute.

17:57.965 --> 18:00.015
You don't say that
in cheerleading, do you?

18:00.017 --> 18:02.134
Well, 'cause you could
actually break a leg, you know,

18:02.136 --> 18:04.102
if one of those weak kids
at the bottom

18:04.104 --> 18:07.339
drops you when you're doing
a cutie-pie double,

18:07.341 --> 18:09.908
or whatever it is.

18:09.910 --> 18:12.160
A cupie double.
Yes, I knew that.

18:12.162 --> 18:15.614
Listen, I'm-I'm gonna just say
knock 'em dead.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.482
How about that?
I love you very much.

18:17.484 --> 18:19.368
Have fun, okay?
Call me right after.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.369
Okay, bye.

18:20.371 --> 18:23.789
I'm so sorry. Come here.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.542
Thanks, Danny.

18:26.544 --> 18:29.261
Hey, you didn't have
to rush back here.

18:29.263 --> 18:31.079
Won't Gracie be disappointed
that you're not there

18:31.081 --> 18:32.214
to cheer her on?

18:32.216 --> 18:34.800
Uh, yeah, but, uh,
the last year at the nationals,

18:34.802 --> 18:36.518
the judges said
that I was too loud,

18:36.520 --> 18:39.521
I was distracting them,
so I'm sure she'll be fine.

18:39.523 --> 18:40.787
Anything you need,
just tell me, okay?

18:40.812 --> 18:41.641
Okay.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.475
Thank you.

18:45.194 --> 18:47.229
Hey.

18:47.231 --> 18:48.363
You all right?

18:48.365 --> 18:50.065
Yeah, I mean...

18:50.067 --> 18:52.451
I did a tour with
this guy, you know?

18:52.453 --> 18:54.653
I want who did this.
I know you do.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.071
So just tell me what to do.

18:56.073 --> 18:57.155
We got John
Cutler's laptop,

18:57.157 --> 18:58.940
but it's encrypted.
I guess I could

18:58.942 --> 19:00.709
run it by Toast,
see what he can do.

19:00.711 --> 19:02.878
I got to tell ya, I think even
Toast has trouble with this one.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.046
We're gonna bring in
the big guns.

19:04.048 --> 19:07.115
Big guns? Like who?
What do you mean?

19:07.117 --> 19:08.667
Big guns like me.

19:09.669 --> 19:11.920
I'll take it to
one of my old D.O.D. contacts,

19:11.922 --> 19:13.055
see if he can't crack it.

19:13.057 --> 19:14.339
Appreciate it, Joe.

19:14.341 --> 19:16.224
You want to go for a ride?

19:16.226 --> 19:18.060
Sure.

19:18.062 --> 19:19.294
All right, but I'm driving.

19:19.296 --> 19:21.296
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's
the story of my life.

19:22.683 --> 19:23.932
Chin, what do you got?

19:23.934 --> 19:25.967
So it turns out
our victim had a second phone

19:25.969 --> 19:27.603
he was using
to contact Abby Maxwell.

19:27.605 --> 19:28.654
It's probably a burner

19:28.656 --> 19:29.688
that his wife didn't know about.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.356
Okay, well,
if he had a second phone,

19:31.358 --> 19:32.441
maybe the cleaner missed it.

19:32.443 --> 19:34.409
I'm sending you the number.

19:37.813 --> 19:39.615
Got a hit.

19:39.617 --> 19:41.283
Tracing it now.

19:43.136 --> 19:44.703
It's moving.

19:45.204 --> 19:47.439
<i>Cath, where is he?</i>

19:49.959 --> 19:52.044
All right, make a right up here.

19:56.049 --> 19:58.300
He's just up ahead.
How close?

19:59.218 --> 20:00.552
About a hundred yards.

20:00.554 --> 20:02.270
He's right in front of us.

20:03.056 --> 20:05.891
There! That's Cutler's car.

20:10.396 --> 20:12.114
Hands on the dash!

20:12.116 --> 20:13.448
Right now!

20:14.617 --> 20:16.451
Don't move, buddy.

20:16.453 --> 20:18.203
Get out of the car
real slow.

20:18.205 --> 20:19.705
Put your hands
behind your head,

20:19.707 --> 20:20.789
interlock your fingers.

20:20.791 --> 20:23.125
Turn around.
Face the car.

20:23.127 --> 20:24.743
Spread your legs.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.495
I didn't steal it, brah,
I swear!

20:26.497 --> 20:27.913
The keys were in the ignition!

20:27.915 --> 20:29.498
What are you talking about?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.083
I was just bouncing around
Kalihi.

20:31.085 --> 20:32.634
Saw the windows down,
saw the keys,

20:32.636 --> 20:34.753
I figured some guy
just wanted to dump it.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.139
Put your hands
behind your back.

20:37.141 --> 20:38.090
Now.

20:38.092 --> 20:39.007
I got him.

20:39.009 --> 20:41.510
Steve, I don't see
the phone,

20:41.512 --> 20:43.011
and he doesn't have it
on him.

20:43.013 --> 20:44.596
I'll check the trunk.
Sit down.

20:50.186 --> 20:51.486
Is he in there?

21:16.751 --> 21:19.101
When's the last time
you changed your shocks, Joe?

21:19.102 --> 21:21.336
About a year ago.
Huh.

21:21.338 --> 21:22.570
You do the struts, too?

21:22.572 --> 21:24.505
'Cause I got to say,
feels like maybe

21:24.507 --> 21:26.490
your suspension might be off
just a little bit.

21:26.492 --> 21:28.292
No, she's handling good.

21:30.162 --> 21:32.046
You didn't feel that?
When we went over that dip,

21:32.048 --> 21:33.798
it felt like
I was gonna throw up...

21:33.800 --> 21:35.800
No, no, I did not feel that.

21:35.802 --> 21:36.934
Okay.

21:36.936 --> 21:39.270
<i>Some people like</i>
<i>a looser ride than others.</i>

21:39.272 --> 21:40.805
It's not my place to judge.

21:40.807 --> 21:42.840
You like it, it's your car,
it's fine.

21:42.842 --> 21:45.193
That, you didn't feel though?
That wasn't...?

21:45.195 --> 21:47.895
Is this what you and Steve do?

21:47.897 --> 21:49.647
You bicker in the car
like an old married couple?

21:49.649 --> 21:52.066
Bicker?
No, no, we don't bicker.

21:52.068 --> 21:54.118
I mean, we argue
from time to time, sure,

21:54.120 --> 21:55.203
but we don't-- no bickering.

21:55.205 --> 21:57.188
Well, look, how about
if I change the subject?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.573
That-that would be fine.

21:58.575 --> 22:01.409
Steve asked me to get in touch
with Doris.

22:02.828 --> 22:05.079
Okay, well, I-I mean,
that makes sense.

22:05.081 --> 22:07.215
You know, he's got questions,
and she may have the answers.

22:07.217 --> 22:08.583
Yeah, well, what I
didn't tell him was

22:08.585 --> 22:11.085
I've been trying to find her
for over a month.

22:11.087 --> 22:12.553
I haven't talked
to her since she put

22:12.555 --> 22:14.205
Adam and Kono on that
freighter that night.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.374
And the chatter is that
once she left the country,

22:17.376 --> 22:19.343
old enemies came
out of the woodwork.

22:19.345 --> 22:21.429
What, she's on the run?

22:21.431 --> 22:22.513
Or worse.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.399
Or worse?

22:24.401 --> 22:25.933
Well, what are you
gonna tell Steve?

22:25.935 --> 22:27.351
I can't tell him anything.

22:27.353 --> 22:28.853
I don't have any confirmation.

22:28.855 --> 22:30.605
What I'm hoping is that

22:30.607 --> 22:32.774
you will tell him
to stand down on this

22:32.776 --> 22:34.826
and let this go.

22:34.828 --> 22:36.411
Because we start
turning over rocks,

22:36.413 --> 22:38.079
God knows what
might crawl out.

22:38.081 --> 22:39.414
Yeah, so I'll just
talk to Steve.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.115
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to me?

22:41.117 --> 22:42.399
Because he trusts you.

22:42.401 --> 22:44.919
He looks at me, he sees
ulterior motives.

22:44.921 --> 22:46.871
He looks at you,
he just sees a friend.

22:46.873 --> 22:48.623
Ah, okay.
Well, I could tell Steve

22:48.625 --> 22:50.425
whatever you want me to tell him
and he's gonna say,

22:50.427 --> 22:51.876
"Okay, sounds good,"
and he's gonna go off

22:51.878 --> 22:53.044
and do whatever he wants to do.

22:53.046 --> 22:54.512
And you know that.

22:54.514 --> 22:55.797
So my advice to you is,

22:55.799 --> 22:57.548
please, get confirmation
on these rumors,

22:57.550 --> 23:00.134
and get the truth,
and share that truth with Steve.

23:00.136 --> 23:01.352
Because you know and I know

23:01.354 --> 23:03.471
that he's not gonna stop
until he gets it.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.392
Are you sure it was Sato's men?

23:08.394 --> 23:09.426
I don't know.

23:09.428 --> 23:11.145
It could've been the Triads.

23:11.147 --> 23:12.230
Here's what you need to do.

23:12.232 --> 23:13.648
You need to get yourself
out of Hong Kong.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.983
You got to get to one of
Doris's safe houses, okay?

23:15.985 --> 23:17.268
No.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.269
Kono...

23:18.271 --> 23:19.287
Look, not without Adam.

23:19.289 --> 23:20.288
You're still a target.

23:20.290 --> 23:21.539
They're not gonna take you off

23:21.541 --> 23:23.074
their hit list just because
they already have Adam.

23:23.076 --> 23:24.492
I'm not leaving him, Chin.

23:24.494 --> 23:25.493
Kono, listen to me!

23:25.495 --> 23:26.828
What good are you gonna be

23:26.830 --> 23:28.162
to Adam if you're dead?

23:29.882 --> 23:32.300
Look, just get yourself
out of Hong Kong, okay?

23:32.302 --> 23:34.836
Let us worry about
getting Adam back.

23:34.838 --> 23:38.222
He gave himself up for me.

23:38.224 --> 23:40.725
He sacrificed himself
so I could get away.

23:40.727 --> 23:42.226
We will find him.

23:42.228 --> 23:44.011
I promise.

23:44.013 --> 23:47.598
Now, please, will you do
what I'm asking?

23:47.600 --> 23:50.151
Cousin, I love you,
but I have to do this.

23:54.606 --> 23:55.639
Okay, listen.

23:55.641 --> 23:57.608
HPD canvassed the area

23:57.610 --> 23:59.277
where our little car thief
found the Impala.

23:59.279 --> 24:01.279
Unfortunately, there's
no traffic cameras down there,

24:01.281 --> 24:03.114
so we're never gonna know
who dropped it off.

24:03.116 --> 24:03.998
What about you?

24:04.000 --> 24:04.999
You get anything?
Yeah.

24:05.001 --> 24:06.250
The cell that
led us to Cutler?

24:06.252 --> 24:08.119
Yeah.
Found something interesting on it.

24:08.121 --> 24:09.086
What?

24:09.088 --> 24:10.755
All right,
so according to Abby,

24:10.757 --> 24:12.990
Cutler used this phone
exclusively to contact her.

24:12.992 --> 24:14.759
Right.
But...

24:14.761 --> 24:16.827
look at this.

24:16.829 --> 24:20.298
The last number Cutler dialed
was to a different number.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.665
Right.
And check out the time.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.818
10:51.

24:23.820 --> 24:25.386
That's two minutes
after the shooting started,

24:25.388 --> 24:27.838
which means that not only did
Cutler not die instantly...

24:27.840 --> 24:30.024
He was alive long enough
to place a phone call.

24:30.026 --> 24:31.893
Let me see that.
Exactly.

24:34.447 --> 24:35.846
We're sorry...

24:35.848 --> 24:37.181
Disconnected?

24:37.183 --> 24:38.616
Yeah.
Probably a burner.

24:38.618 --> 24:39.784
Okay, so this guy,

24:39.786 --> 24:41.518
he takes two at close range,
he's bleeding out.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.038
He doesn't call 911,
he calls some mystery number.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.157
We need to find out who
was on the other end.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.076
Chin.

24:49.078 --> 24:50.461
On the way.

24:54.183 --> 24:55.783
Cutler had a ton
of classified material

24:55.785 --> 24:57.802
on his hard drive,
all related to

24:57.804 --> 24:59.837
Palek's various
military projects.

24:59.839 --> 25:00.972
Wait. Cutler didn't have

25:00.974 --> 25:02.807
security clearance;
how'd he get the intel?

25:02.809 --> 25:03.808
From his wife.

25:03.810 --> 25:04.942
He installed

25:04.944 --> 25:06.477
a pretty sophisticated
piece of malware

25:06.479 --> 25:07.678
on Sandra Cutler's laptop,

25:07.680 --> 25:10.565
and so he was able to have
access to all of her

25:10.567 --> 25:11.816
work files, e-mails,
everything.

25:11.818 --> 25:14.318
So not only was this guy
violating the marriage,

25:14.320 --> 25:15.853
but he was violating
her privacy

25:15.855 --> 25:17.554
and stealing
her security clearance.

25:17.556 --> 25:18.940
Now here's where
it get really interesting.

25:18.942 --> 25:20.241
It turns out,
Cutler was routinely

25:20.243 --> 25:23.444
downloading classified data
onto flash drives.

25:24.496 --> 25:26.364
Sounds like he was
spying for somebody.

25:26.366 --> 25:28.249
That's what we were thinking.

25:28.251 --> 25:29.667
If you're right,

25:29.669 --> 25:31.669
that would explain where he's
getting all that extra cash.

25:31.671 --> 25:33.537
It would also explain
why he got murdered.

25:33.539 --> 25:36.073
The type of people that would
pay Cutler to spy for them

25:36.075 --> 25:38.175
probably wouldn't think twice
about killing him

25:38.177 --> 25:39.844
if their relationship
went south, right?

25:39.846 --> 25:41.846
Okay, so if Cutler is
selling classified info,

25:41.848 --> 25:43.130
who's the buyer?

25:43.132 --> 25:44.748
I reached out to my friends

25:44.750 --> 25:46.050
over at FBI Counterintelligence,

25:46.052 --> 25:48.469
and they say
the most likely suspects

25:48.471 --> 25:50.805
are this trio
of private companies.

25:50.807 --> 25:52.940
Himmel Aerospace
and Defense.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.275
That's Palek's chief rival.

25:54.277 --> 25:57.311
Check out one of the names
of their subsidiaries.

25:57.313 --> 25:59.063
Kahiku Management Company?

25:59.065 --> 26:01.983
They rent out the cabin
where Cutler was killed.

26:01.985 --> 26:03.367
Well, that can't be
a coincidence.

26:03.369 --> 26:05.453
Up until now, we thought
that that was a place

26:05.455 --> 26:07.204
that Cutler used just
to bring Abby Maxwell,

26:07.206 --> 26:08.873
but what if it was
also a dead drop

26:08.875 --> 26:10.207
for those flash drives?

26:10.209 --> 26:12.043
All right, Chin, uh,
who runs Himmel's operations

26:12.045 --> 26:13.610
on the island?

26:13.612 --> 26:15.346
That would be
a Lee Benner.

26:15.348 --> 26:16.330
Let's go say hello.

26:25.057 --> 26:28.638
So you're accusing us of
corporate espionage and murder.

26:28.928 --> 26:30.010
That's absurd.

26:30.012 --> 26:32.012
John Cutler
was gunned down

26:32.014 --> 26:33.731
in a secluded cabin
managed by your company.

26:33.733 --> 26:35.683
You gonna tell me
that was a coincidence?

26:35.685 --> 26:36.734
Yes.

26:36.736 --> 26:38.152
If that's what
actually happened.

26:38.154 --> 26:39.553
What do you mean,
"if it happened"?

26:39.555 --> 26:40.821
I was there.
I saw it happen.

26:40.823 --> 26:41.989
Well, I'm sorry,

26:41.991 --> 26:43.824
but I haven't heard
anything about a murder

26:43.826 --> 26:45.943
at one of our
properties, so...

26:45.945 --> 26:47.528
you must be mistaken.

26:52.117 --> 26:55.002
There's been no mistake.

26:55.004 --> 26:58.289
You guys killed Cutler
and then you covered it up.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.957
Show me some proof.

27:08.016 --> 27:10.851
Well... ask
and you shall receive.

27:10.853 --> 27:11.802
What's this?

27:11.804 --> 27:13.187
That's a lab report.

27:13.189 --> 27:14.939
See, we just matched up
the tire tracks

27:14.941 --> 27:17.224
found at the scene
to a van

27:17.226 --> 27:19.110
registered to
your company.

27:19.694 --> 27:21.779
How's that for proof?

27:21.781 --> 27:23.731
So why don't you tell me
what happened with Cutler.

27:23.733 --> 27:25.566
Did he up his price
and it piss you off?

27:25.568 --> 27:27.568
Maybe you thought he'd been
compromised. What happened?

27:27.570 --> 27:29.236
What happened?!

27:30.540 --> 27:32.072
Yes, Cutler was spying for us.

27:32.074 --> 27:34.775
Yes, we scrubbed
the crime scene.

27:34.777 --> 27:36.243
But we didn't kill him, come on.

27:36.245 --> 27:37.795
Oh, of cour...
I'm sorry, right.

27:37.797 --> 27:39.947
So somebody else killed him
and you covered it up?

27:39.949 --> 27:40.998
That doesn't make any sense.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.416
It's the truth.
Is it?

27:42.418 --> 27:44.969
We didn't want anyone
connecting Cutler back to us.

27:44.971 --> 27:47.171
So, yes, we covered it up.

27:47.173 --> 27:49.840
Look, Cutler was
feeding us good intel.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.792
There was... there was
no reason to kill him.

27:51.794 --> 27:53.227
In fact, we tried
to save him.

27:53.229 --> 27:55.429
What? What are you
talking about?

27:55.431 --> 27:57.398
He called us for help
right after he'd been shot.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.682
And-and I can
prove that, too.

27:58.684 --> 28:00.684
We had a burner phone that
we kept in touch with him...

28:00.686 --> 28:02.770
We know about the phone.
What happened next?

28:02.772 --> 28:04.638
We sent a medic.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.640
But by the time
he got there,

28:06.642 --> 28:08.492
Cutler had been
dead for a while.

28:08.494 --> 28:09.860
After that, we were just,

28:09.862 --> 28:11.695
you know, worried about
controlling the situation.

28:11.697 --> 28:12.780
Damage control.

28:12.782 --> 28:14.165
Well, maybe you ought
to start worrying

28:14.167 --> 28:15.533
about your legal defense,
because right now

28:15.535 --> 28:16.867
you're looking at
obstruction of justice

28:16.869 --> 28:18.819
and accessory
after the fact.

28:18.821 --> 28:21.455
Okay. Yeah, you got me
dead to rights.

28:22.457 --> 28:23.874
But...

28:23.876 --> 28:26.510
maybe...

28:26.512 --> 28:28.429
we could help
each other out.

28:28.431 --> 28:29.680
How do you figure?

28:29.682 --> 28:33.601
Well, what if
I were to say that, um...

28:33.603 --> 28:36.437
in the course of cleaning
the crime scene,

28:36.439 --> 28:38.522
my people...

28:38.524 --> 28:41.058
may have
gathered evidence.

28:42.194 --> 28:43.944
Evidence that could
help you catch

28:43.946 --> 28:45.946
whoever killed Cutler.

28:49.701 --> 28:51.735
What a mess.

28:51.737 --> 28:53.237
With all the cross-
contamination, we'll be lucky

28:53.239 --> 28:55.372
to pull a single print
off of any of this stuff.

28:55.374 --> 28:56.574
Do what you can, okay?
It's all we've got to go on.

28:56.576 --> 28:59.543
Yeah.

29:49.794 --> 29:51.428
When he was five years old,

29:51.430 --> 29:52.880
I asked my son Steve

29:52.882 --> 29:54.965
what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.801
"I want to be a cop,
Dad, like you."

29:57.803 --> 30:00.721
I told him to...

30:00.723 --> 30:03.691
be anything but that.

30:27.299 --> 30:29.383
<i>Let's change this out, huh?</i>

30:36.925 --> 30:38.842
Oh...

30:38.844 --> 30:39.977
I'm sorry.

30:41.813 --> 30:42.846
You all right?

30:42.848 --> 30:45.298
Mm-hmm.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.651
This could've done
with some more stitches.

30:51.906 --> 30:53.473
What are you
laughing at?

30:53.475 --> 30:55.275
Uh...

30:55.277 --> 30:58.078
I was just thinking back to
the last time I needed stitches.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.114
All right.

31:00.116 --> 31:01.248
Billy and I were

31:01.250 --> 31:02.983
on an operation in Kabul...
Yeah.

31:02.985 --> 31:04.535
...and, uh,

31:04.537 --> 31:07.487
I got this nasty cut
on the back of my head.

31:07.489 --> 31:09.006
It was gonna take, like,

31:09.008 --> 31:10.841
15, 20 stitches
to close it up,

31:10.843 --> 31:12.492
but all we had
were Band-Aids.

31:12.494 --> 31:15.045
Yeah.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.880
What'd you do?

31:16.882 --> 31:18.682
Billy just grabbed

31:18.684 --> 31:21.101
these huge clumps of hair
around the cut

31:21.103 --> 31:22.469
and tied them together.

31:23.505 --> 31:25.222
Like a... like a shoelace.

31:25.224 --> 31:27.024
That's pretty resourceful.
I know.

31:30.729 --> 31:33.147
All right, you're good.

31:37.202 --> 31:39.370
I just can't believe he's gone.

31:44.826 --> 31:46.193
Yeah.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.212
And for what?

31:48.214 --> 31:51.198
For trying to save
a guy like John Cutler?

31:51.200 --> 31:52.750
Now, listen to me,
all right?

31:52.752 --> 31:55.535
Billy saw somebody in danger,
and he reacted, all right?

31:55.537 --> 31:56.887
That's what he did.

31:56.889 --> 31:59.923
And the fact that he knew the
kind of man that Cutler was

31:59.925 --> 32:02.810
and he still put himself
in harm's way?

32:04.062 --> 32:06.346
He was a hero, Catherine.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.051
Yeah.

32:12.271 --> 32:14.221
I just got off
the phone with the lab.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.106
There's something you're
both gonna want to see.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.778
What do you got?

32:20.780 --> 32:22.579
Well, there were no prints

32:22.581 --> 32:24.915
on any of the shell casings
from our shooter's gun.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.566
But the lab did find
traces of blood

32:26.568 --> 32:28.285
on one of the slugs
from Billy's gun.

32:28.287 --> 32:29.753
Wait a minute.
Billy hit the shooter?

32:29.755 --> 32:31.004
Apparently.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.207
That's my boy.

32:33.209 --> 32:35.092
It must've been
a through-and-through.

32:35.094 --> 32:37.211
I bet the slug was imbedded
in the cabin wall

32:37.213 --> 32:39.012
and our cleaner dug it out.
You run the blood?

32:39.014 --> 32:40.180
Yeah, we got a match, too.

32:40.182 --> 32:42.049
Our killer's a guy
by the name of

32:42.051 --> 32:43.684
Jason Kroll.

32:43.686 --> 32:45.102
He's believed to be a hit man.

32:45.104 --> 32:47.554
HPD had him as a suspect
in two homicide cases last year,

32:47.556 --> 32:49.022
but couldn't make
anything stick.

32:49.024 --> 32:51.642
We got any idea who hired
this guy to kill Cutler?

32:51.644 --> 32:53.093
No, but courtesy of
his parole officer,

32:53.095 --> 32:55.446
we have a current address.
So why don't we go ask him.

32:55.448 --> 32:57.614
<i>Jason Kroll! Five-O!</i>

32:59.433 --> 33:00.617
I got blood.

33:00.619 --> 33:02.369
Move.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.257
Jason Kroll?

33:23.259 --> 33:24.475
Five-O!
Open the door!

33:24.477 --> 33:25.642
Jason?

33:25.644 --> 33:27.177
We know you're hurt.
We can get you help.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.929
But first we need to know
that you're not armed.

33:30.766 --> 33:32.816
He's armed.

33:32.818 --> 33:34.485
You think?

33:48.149 --> 33:49.783
We need the paramedics
right now.

33:53.087 --> 33:54.838
Right now,
Catherine, go!

33:54.840 --> 33:56.924
Catherine, now!
Paramedics, let's go!

33:56.926 --> 33:58.292
Okay.

34:01.212 --> 34:03.964
Who hired you to
kill John Cutler?

34:03.966 --> 34:05.599
Don't you die on me
you son of a bitch.

34:05.601 --> 34:06.850
You hear me?

34:08.835 --> 34:11.638
Hey! Who hired you?!

34:34.253 --> 34:35.204
You got anything?

34:35.205 --> 34:36.522
Nothing.

34:37.023 --> 34:38.023
Keep looking.

34:38.025 --> 34:39.574
There's got to be
something here

34:39.577 --> 34:42.161
that's gonna tell us
who hired this guy.

34:43.130 --> 34:44.213
Guys?

34:44.215 --> 34:46.465
I think I got something.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.333
What?

34:48.335 --> 34:49.719
Okay, so it looks like

34:49.721 --> 34:51.704
Kroll was hired
over the Tor Network.

34:51.706 --> 34:53.306
What is that?

34:53.308 --> 34:54.674
It's kind of like
a shadow Internet.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.092
Some people call it
"the Dark-net."

34:56.094 --> 34:58.594
It was originally created
by the Navy,

34:58.596 --> 35:00.346
but nowadays it's utilized
mostly by criminals

35:00.348 --> 35:03.766
because it allows them
to be completely anonymous.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.850
So tracing an I.P.?

35:04.852 --> 35:06.936
Is not gonna happen, but...

35:06.938 --> 35:08.170
here comes the good news.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.438
According to these e-mails,

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
Kroll wouldn't take
the Cutler job

35:11.442 --> 35:12.658
unless the client
revealed himself.

35:12.660 --> 35:13.892
And did they?

35:13.894 --> 35:15.111
Not at first.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.946
But they came around.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.565
Here-- looks like they sent
their last message

35:19.567 --> 35:20.733
outside of the network.

35:20.735 --> 35:23.235
And that I.P. we can trace.

35:23.237 --> 35:25.288
<i>But I liked John.</i>

35:25.290 --> 35:26.956
Why would I kill him?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.107
Well, maybe you liked him
more than you let on.

35:28.109 --> 35:29.675
You wanted John
to take you away

35:29.677 --> 35:31.077
from your secret
little escort life,

35:31.078 --> 35:33.379
but he had no intentions
of ending his marriage.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.914
A woman scorned, Abby.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.349
It's the oldest motive there is.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.683
These e-mails?

35:37.685 --> 35:38.851
They were sent
to the shooter.

35:38.853 --> 35:40.586
We traced the
I.P. address.

35:40.588 --> 35:41.920
Comes straight from this office.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.361
O-Only I couldn't have
sent these.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.029
See the date and the time?

35:50.031 --> 35:53.683
I wasn't here; I was with a
client at a hotel on Kalakaua.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.401
I can prove it.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.371
Okay, Abby, who else has got
access to your computer?

35:58.373 --> 35:59.938
Just my assistant Andrew.

36:01.941 --> 36:03.075
He's taking off.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.611
Hey. Hey!

36:25.016 --> 36:26.766
You should've let me die.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.068
Andrew, why would
you do this?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.304
I'm in love with you, Abby.

36:32.306 --> 36:33.939
I've always loved you.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.308
I just wanted you to stop.

36:38.745 --> 36:41.364
Unrequited love.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.749
Second oldest motive
there is.

37:19.519 --> 37:21.320
Hello, Sam.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.289
Geez, Joe.

37:23.291 --> 37:24.407
When'd you get back?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.959
You know me,
I come and go as I please.

37:28.662 --> 37:31.363
Family is safe and sound,
fast asleep.

37:31.365 --> 37:34.133
Well, can I assume you
didn't break into my home

37:34.135 --> 37:36.201
just to say hello?

37:36.203 --> 37:40.056
When John McGarrett was
investigating his wife's murder,

37:40.058 --> 37:43.259
he found a lot of evidence,
bits and pieces.

37:43.261 --> 37:47.063
Not all of it made sense to him
at the time.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.181
You recognize those numbers?

37:51.518 --> 37:53.886
Can't say that I do.

37:53.888 --> 37:56.221
It's an offshore account.

37:56.223 --> 37:58.724
CIA used it to fund black ops.

37:58.726 --> 38:01.327
If I gave those numbers
to a reporter friend of mine

38:01.329 --> 38:02.728
and he started digging,

38:02.730 --> 38:05.564
who knows
what he might come up with.

38:05.566 --> 38:07.533
Or how high it goes.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.168
What do you want?

38:09.170 --> 38:10.169
Doris McGarrett.

38:10.171 --> 38:12.171
I need a location
and a phone number.

38:13.039 --> 38:14.373
Take my advice, Joe,

38:14.375 --> 38:16.342
and just walk away.

38:16.344 --> 38:18.177
This one's too hot.

38:18.179 --> 38:19.762
Steve McGarrett
wants answers, Sam.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.881
He's not gonna quit
till he gets them.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.602
I'll tell you what.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.888
Because we're friends...

38:28.890 --> 38:30.973
I'll give you the information
you want on Doris.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.425
You can decide how much
of it you want to share

38:33.427 --> 38:35.361
with her persistent son.

38:35.363 --> 38:38.147
It may be the better
part of valor

38:38.149 --> 38:39.782
to keep him in the dark...

38:39.784 --> 38:42.267
once you hear what
I have to say.

38:47.440 --> 38:51.276
Eternal rest grant unto Billy,
oh, Lord.

38:51.278 --> 38:53.929
And let perpetual light
shine upon him.

38:53.931 --> 38:58.283
May his soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed,

38:58.285 --> 39:01.220
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

39:01.222 --> 39:03.422
Amen.

39:09.679 --> 39:10.729
Ready.

39:10.731 --> 39:11.814
Aim.

39:11.816 --> 39:13.599
Fire.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.100
Ready.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.051
Aim.

39:16.053 --> 39:19.137
Fire.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.406
Ready.

39:20.408 --> 39:21.774
Aim. Fire.

Thank you. Tom.

Call me Tom.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.400
He talked about you
a lot, you know.

40:55.402 --> 40:57.336
He said you guys were

40:57.338 --> 40:59.237
a lot more than
just father and son.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.006
That you were real friends.

41:01.841 --> 41:03.909

I know that, uh...

41:23.948 --> 41:26.065
this is not exactly
the time or the place,

41:26.067 --> 41:27.533
but I have news about your mom.

41:27.535 --> 41:29.735
You gonna give me
the whole story this time?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.821
I'm pretty sure you didn't give
it to me the other night, Joe.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.606
You're right, but that's
only because at the time

41:34.608 --> 41:37.293
I didn't want to burden you with
what was only a gut feeling,

41:37.295 --> 41:38.877
with fortunately turned
out to be wrong.

41:38.879 --> 41:41.714
You thought she was dead?

41:41.716 --> 41:42.614
I did.

41:42.616 --> 41:43.999
But I have confirmation

41:44.001 --> 41:45.617
that is not the case.

41:45.619 --> 41:48.453
So where is she?
When's she coming home?

41:48.455 --> 41:50.806
I don't know.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.341
And she's not.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.343
At least not
anytime soon.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.596
The word is that Doris
is active again.

41:57.598 --> 41:58.814
That's all I got.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.099
Everything else
is classified.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.017
It's classified. Wow.
Mm.

42:06.239 --> 42:08.691
I want you to please
keep looking for her.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.275
You shake the trees
and you find her, okay?

42:10.277 --> 42:11.493
Steve, your mom stayed
hidden for 20 years.

42:11.495 --> 42:12.828
She is not
gonna be found.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.814
She'll surface
when she's ready.

42:18.317 --> 42:20.002
Yeah.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.338
When do you think
that's gonna be?

42:22.340 --> 42:26.091
I think that'll be when
she's prepared to face you.

42:32.282 --> 42:34.967
Hey.

42:36.002 --> 42:37.803
How you holding up?

42:37.805 --> 42:40.005
I'm, uh...

42:42.142 --> 42:44.943
I'm a mess.

42:44.945 --> 42:47.012
You know, I just
keep telling myself

42:47.014 --> 42:49.064
I did everything
I could to save him.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.515
No, Catherine.

42:50.517 --> 42:51.900
Don't do this.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.852
What happened is not on you.

42:54.654 --> 42:57.289
