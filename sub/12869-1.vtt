WEBVTT

00:26.992 --> 00:31.538
Name... Annie Braddock.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.583
Age... 21.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.752
Area of interest...

00:36.835 --> 00:40.172
anthropology.

00:40.213 --> 00:42.132
Describe your
work experience

00:42.132 --> 00:45.010
as it relates
to your intended field.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.095
My God.

00:47.137 --> 00:49.765
Where do I begin?

00:49.806 --> 00:52.809
Attention. The Museum of Natural History

00:52.851 --> 00:55.520
will be closing in
15 minutes.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.733
Please exit the hall

00:59.775 --> 01:02.319
by using
the western staircase.

01:15.207 --> 01:17.376
Child-rearing around the world

01:17.417 --> 01:20.712
boasts a wide variety of
customs and mores.

01:25.342 --> 01:28.929
But perhaps the most bizarre
social patterns

01:28.971 --> 01:32.432
can be found within the small island
community of Manhattan.

01:32.474 --> 01:34.685
Asshole!

01:34.726 --> 01:37.688
The inhabitants of the region
known as the Upper East Side

01:37.729 --> 01:40.691
have the most prosperous,
yet idiosyncratic

01:40.691 --> 01:43.151
social systems
on the planet.

01:43.193 --> 01:44.987
After successfully mating

01:45.028 --> 01:46.822
and producing offspring,

01:46.863 --> 01:49.283
the men are often distant
and uninvolved,

01:49.324 --> 01:51.368
leaving their women
to hunt, gather

01:51.410 --> 01:53.495
and provide for
their families.

01:56.582 --> 01:59.876
Yet the resourceful mothers
of the Upper East Side

01:59.918 --> 02:01.878
have plenty of time
to participate

02:01.920 --> 02:05.215
in a variety of sex-role-
specific activities.

02:05.257 --> 02:09.136
These include
body mutilation,

02:09.176 --> 02:12.472
sacred meditation...

02:12.514 --> 02:14.558
...even fasting rituals.

02:17.936 --> 02:20.814
Which brings us to our focus
on child-rearing:

02:20.856 --> 02:22.608
Who actually does it?

02:22.649 --> 02:25.235
Well, in Africa,
they have a saying...

02:25.277 --> 02:27.905
"It takes a village
to raise a child."

02:27.946 --> 02:30.240
But for the tribe of
the Upper East Side,

02:30.282 --> 02:32.576
it takes just
one person...

02:32.618 --> 02:34.494
the nanny.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.294
Okay, so what's
depicted here

02:42.336 --> 02:44.463
is not a typical
tribal ritual,

02:44.504 --> 02:47.925
but rather the unraveling
of one such nanny.

02:47.966 --> 02:50.552
Actually, this nanny is me.

02:50.594 --> 02:53.347
And why I'm telling off
a teddy bear is the subject

02:53.388 --> 02:55.223
of this field diary.

02:55.265 --> 02:58.977
If by chance my report stereotypes
or geographically profiles,

02:59.019 --> 03:00.812
forgive me.

03:00.854 --> 03:04.149
I'm not exactly
an objective observer.

03:08.111 --> 03:11.114
Master in economics,
minor in communications.

03:11.156 --> 03:14.159
- Yeah!
- Elaine Bassen,

03:14.159 --> 03:17.162
honors in urban planning,
minor in sociology.

03:18.455 --> 03:19.998
Annie Braddock,

03:20.040 --> 03:22.918
high honors in business,
minor in anthropology.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.712
So here I am a few months before
the teddy bear incident...

03:25.754 --> 03:26.880
Whoo-whoo!

03:26.922 --> 03:28.423
...a native New Jersey girl

03:28.465 --> 03:30.926
participating in a dreaded
rite-of-passage ceremony.

03:30.968 --> 03:32.886
- Doh!
Oh my God!

03:32.928 --> 03:34.388
Spazz!

03:34.429 --> 03:35.847
And here's the woman who reared me

03:35.889 --> 03:37.599
pretty much all
by herself.

03:37.641 --> 03:39.476
She's a nurse.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.645
Note the shoes.

03:41.687 --> 03:45.148
What is it?

03:45.190 --> 03:47.901
You'll see.

03:47.943 --> 03:50.988
Oh, wow.

03:51.029 --> 03:53.198
- Thank you.
- I know it's not much,

03:53.240 --> 03:55.701
but I wanted to buy you
your first business suit.

03:55.742 --> 03:58.287
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You can look back on this

03:58.328 --> 04:00.664
- when you're a famous CFO.
- Oh, Mom.

04:00.706 --> 04:03.292
Gosh, come on. It's one meeting
at Goldman Sachs.

04:03.375 --> 04:07.212
It's highly competitive.
I'm probably never gonna get the job.

04:07.254 --> 04:09.256
All right, stop
with the negativity.

04:09.298 --> 04:11.842
Your father was always negative
and look where it got him.

04:11.842 --> 04:15.345
- Double-wide trailer in Scranton.
...in Scranton.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.389
Honey, I'm not kidding.

04:17.389 --> 04:20.392
I would give the world to be sitting
where you're sitting right now.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.020
You are so much
smarter than I was.

04:23.061 --> 04:25.355
No man is gonna
squash your dreams.

04:25.397 --> 04:29.151
No one's gonna tell you
how to live your life.

04:29.192 --> 04:33.071
Maybe I'm... maybe I'm not
CFO material, you know?

04:33.071 --> 04:36.533
No, what if I'm better
suited at something...

04:36.575 --> 04:38.076
- something else?
- Like what?

04:38.118 --> 04:40.662
Anthropology? Honey how are you
gonna make a living at that?

04:40.746 --> 04:44.082
Look, if you really want to
run around in grass skirts,

04:44.124 --> 04:47.836
then make enough money to
spend Christmas at Club Med.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.930
Annie, it's 7:15.

04:57.971 --> 05:00.849
Get moving or
you're gonna be late.

05:01.266 --> 05:02.893
New Jersey PATH train to Manhattan

05:02.976 --> 05:04.645
arriving on track two.

05:04.686 --> 05:05.896
Oh.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.564
New Jersey PATH train
to Manhattan

05:07.606 --> 05:09.233
arriving on track two.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.907
Oh, goodness.

05:16.949 --> 05:20.911
I have to admire
this corporate drag. Wow.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.914
Well, at least I'm not wearing last
night's outfit at 8:00 a.m., party girl.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.125
Let's just say that you
missed a fabulous throw-down

05:27.167 --> 05:29.086
and Tom Waylan was there.

05:29.127 --> 05:30.712
- So?
- He asked about you.

05:30.796 --> 05:32.130
Twice.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.341
All right, well,
I gotta go.

05:34.383 --> 05:36.385
- Real life awaits.
- God.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.428
You know, I bet none of
those cultures you study

05:38.470 --> 05:40.264
practice such
rigorous celibacy.

05:40.305 --> 05:43.016
- You ever hear of the Shakers?
- Yes, and they're extinct.

05:49.898 --> 05:51.817
Excuse me, sir? Sir.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.652
- Yeah?
- I got off at the wrong stop.

05:53.694 --> 05:56.071
Can you tell me where
Chambers Street is, please?

05:56.113 --> 05:57.990
You see the building
with the red umbrella?

05:57.990 --> 06:00.200
- Yes.
- It's about five blocks below that.

06:00.242 --> 06:01.994
Oh shit.

06:03.662 --> 06:06.540
Our financial analyst training program

06:06.582 --> 06:08.208
is so competitive.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.545
We have over 8,000 applicants
for 10 positions.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.630
So, why don't you
tell me,

06:13.672 --> 06:17.551
in your own words,
who exactly is Annie Braddock?

06:17.593 --> 06:19.553
Wow, that's...

06:19.595 --> 06:22.097
that's certainly
an easy enough question.

06:22.139 --> 06:23.974
Mm-hm.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.351
Annie Braddock is

06:26.351 --> 06:29.021
a kind...

06:30.022 --> 06:32.274
well...

06:33.442 --> 06:36.361
I am...

06:36.361 --> 06:39.031
Go on.

06:39.072 --> 06:42.034
Well, you see...

06:42.075 --> 06:43.827
Mm-hm.

06:43.869 --> 06:45.954
I have absolutely
no idea.

06:45.996 --> 06:47.164
Excuse me.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.793
Who is Annie Braddock?

06:51.877 --> 06:53.837
It wasn't exactly
a trick question.

06:53.879 --> 06:57.382
Yet somehow I couldn't
formulate a response.

06:57.424 --> 06:59.676
Of course I knew
all the basic facts...

06:59.718 --> 07:03.013
the date of birth, home town,
socioeconomic makeup.

07:03.013 --> 07:06.266
But I didn't really know
who I was, where I fit in,

07:06.308 --> 07:08.393
who I was gonna be.

07:08.435 --> 07:11.605
I was suddenly terrified
I'd never find the answer.

07:11.647 --> 07:14.399
I need five rolls of fabric
overnighted from London.

07:14.441 --> 07:16.985
I don't care
how much it costs.

07:17.027 --> 07:18.362
# Ooh #

07:18.362 --> 07:20.739
# You're a native
New Yorker... #

07:20.781 --> 07:22.449
How about her?

07:22.491 --> 07:25.202
This woman... could she
be Annie Braddock?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.454
# You should know by now #

07:27.496 --> 07:30.624
# You're a native
New Yorker... #

07:32.751 --> 07:35.254
Hmm.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.383
Or perhaps this
is Annie Braddock?

07:41.760 --> 07:45.889
# You grew up
riding the subways #

07:45.931 --> 07:48.308
# Running with people #

07:48.350 --> 07:51.103
# Up in Harlem,
down on Broadway #

07:51.144 --> 07:54.606
# There you are
lost in the shadows #

07:54.648 --> 07:57.317
# Searching for someone #

07:57.359 --> 08:00.404
# You're the heart and soul
of New York City... #

08:02.906 --> 08:04.908
On that spring afternoon,

08:04.950 --> 08:08.870
it seemed my future
was finally set.

08:08.912 --> 08:11.248
A Central Park bag lady
I would be.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.918
At least I'd finally get
to live in Manhattan.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.713
But before I officially
surrendered to fate,

08:17.754 --> 08:21.008
something... or rather,
someone...

08:21.049 --> 08:23.760
intervened.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.515
Mmm.

08:31.268 --> 08:33.270
- Whoa!
- Ahh ahh!

08:37.774 --> 08:39.359
Hello there.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.777
Hi.
Are you okay?

08:40.818 --> 08:42.988
Get off of me,
you pervert.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.412
Do you belong to anyone,
little man?

08:50.454 --> 08:52.956
Grayer!
- I belong to you.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.584
Grayer!

08:55.626 --> 08:58.670
Oh God.
Thank you so much.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.506
You just averted
a minor disaster.

09:01.548 --> 09:03.508
The woman featured here...

09:03.508 --> 09:05.469
the one wearing
the Dior snakeskin jacket

09:05.510 --> 09:06.803
and Louis Vuitton
shoes...

09:06.845 --> 09:09.181
is unfortunately not
Annie Braddock.

09:09.222 --> 09:11.475
# New York City girl... #

09:13.352 --> 09:16.021
She is, in fact, a perfect
female specimen

09:16.063 --> 09:17.940
from the
Upper East Side clan.

09:17.981 --> 09:19.816
For the purpose of
this case study,

09:19.858 --> 09:22.694
we'll just call her
Mrs. X.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.072
Hi, I'm Mrs. X.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.658
Let me apologize for
my feral son.

09:27.699 --> 09:29.701
Oh, no need to
apologize.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.328
Please, I love kids.
I'm Annie.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.455
You're a nanny?
Oh!

09:33.497 --> 09:34.957
- No, I'm not.
- No wonder.

09:34.998 --> 09:37.084
- You're so good with children.
- Oh, I'm not.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.461
Actually, I just
lost my nanny Bertie,

09:39.503 --> 09:41.964
which is why I'm out in
this godforsaken park

09:42.047 --> 09:43.590
- by myself.
- Okay.

09:43.632 --> 09:45.634
- She left us to go get married.
- All right.

09:45.717 --> 09:48.637
Oh my God.
Are... are you employed?

09:50.013 --> 09:52.432
- No, unfortunately, l...
- Fabulous!

09:52.474 --> 09:54.434
Look, here...
here is my card.

09:54.476 --> 09:57.562
Please please please
call me later this week.

09:57.604 --> 09:59.565
We'll schedule a lunch.
Anywhere you'd like to go.

09:59.606 --> 10:01.483
- I'm sorry...
- The Mark, the Four Seasons.

10:01.525 --> 10:04.403
Unfortunately, I have to run, but I
really look forward to hearing from you.

10:04.444 --> 10:06.280
I'm sorry... I really think
you misunderstood me.

10:06.321 --> 10:08.240
I have a very
good feeling about this.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.908
- I...
- Call me.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.376
Pardon me, I couldn't
help but overhear.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.211
I'm looking for
a new nanny too.

10:21.211 --> 10:22.879
- Oh I...
- Can I give you my card as well?

10:22.921 --> 10:25.257
- Excuse me?
- I pay well above average.

10:25.299 --> 10:28.302
- I have a card too, call me.
- I have a place in the Hamptons.

10:28.343 --> 10:30.387
Donald Trump lives
in my building.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.390
It seemed that fate now
offered me a wonderful alternative...

10:33.432 --> 10:36.518
an opportunity to completely
duck out of my life.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.062
So I decided for
one summer

10:39.104 --> 10:41.315
to abandon Annie

10:41.356 --> 10:43.984
and trade her in for
a brand-new persona...

10:44.026 --> 10:45.777
Nanny.

10:47.779 --> 10:51.950
Of course there was
one tiny problem.

10:51.992 --> 10:55.913
Everything I knew about
nannying came from the movies.

10:57.581 --> 11:01.209
Even so, I fell
asleep confident

11:01.251 --> 11:04.004
that I'd magically
find my way.

11:10.344 --> 11:12.971
Annie?

11:13.013 --> 11:14.932
Annie!

11:37.454 --> 11:39.831
Annie?

11:39.873 --> 11:43.168
Ahh-hoo-hoo!

11:44.670 --> 11:47.547
Get your feet
on the ground, young lady.

12:09.403 --> 12:11.280
Hmm.

12:17.452 --> 12:20.414
The fact that I had
no child-care experience

12:20.455 --> 12:22.874
mattered little to the matriarchs
of the Upper East Side.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.460
Even though I
don't have a job,

12:25.502 --> 12:28.630
I just don't seem to have
enough time for myself.

12:28.672 --> 12:30.882
All they needed
to know was that I was white,

12:30.924 --> 12:33.885
a college grad,
and terminally single.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.221
As you can see,
my husband and I

12:36.221 --> 12:37.681
are getting a divorce.

12:37.723 --> 12:41.101
So you and the kids
must remain

12:41.143 --> 12:43.061
on my side of
the apartment

12:43.061 --> 12:44.855
at all times...

12:44.897 --> 12:47.900
until the custody
battle is settled.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.943
Oh...

12:49.985 --> 12:53.864
In short, I was the Chanel
bag of nannies.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.657
I heard through the grapevine

12:55.699 --> 12:57.242
you've been meeting
with a lot of people.

12:57.284 --> 13:00.037
So I thought you might appreciate
a civilized lunch at Bergdorf's

13:00.078 --> 13:01.747
rather than being
interviewed at the apartment.

13:01.788 --> 13:03.332
Thank you,
that's very considerate.

13:03.373 --> 13:05.918
Not really.
I just love to eat out.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.920
I'll probably come up
with a million excuses

13:07.961 --> 13:09.421
for us to go have lunch.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.757
I mean, if you end up
with us, I mean.

13:11.798 --> 13:13.800
Ready?

13:13.842 --> 13:16.011
Do... do you know
what you're having?

13:16.053 --> 13:17.930
I don't mean
to rush you,

13:17.971 --> 13:21.141
but I'm attending a 2:00 lecture

13:21.183 --> 13:24.394
"Super Mom, Trying to Juggle It All."

13:24.436 --> 13:26.855
I'll just have the burger.

13:26.897 --> 13:29.900
Thanks.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.486
I can't guarantee
that the meat here

13:32.527 --> 13:35.405
is antibiotic-free.
But the chef here is from Brittany,

13:35.447 --> 13:39.159
so I highly recommend the crepe
Bretagne. Deux, s'il vous plait.

13:39.201 --> 13:41.578
- Okay.
- Excellent choice.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.163
Thanks.

13:46.416 --> 13:47.960
You're from New Jersey.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.128
Unfortunately.

13:50.170 --> 13:53.715
Oh no, there are some very
lovely parts of that state.

13:53.757 --> 13:56.426
Friends of ours have a horse
farm in Upper Saddle River.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.886
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

13:57.928 --> 14:00.264
l... I hear it's
really nice there.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.057
I'll have to take you
riding there one day.

14:02.099 --> 14:03.308
Okay.

14:03.350 --> 14:05.185
Tell me more.

14:05.227 --> 14:08.272
I want to know
all about you.

14:08.272 --> 14:11.441
- Uh...
- I'm from Connecticut, actually.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.819
I went to Smith.
And don't believe the rumors,

14:13.860 --> 14:16.029
we weren't all
lesbians.

14:16.071 --> 14:17.531
After graduation,

14:17.573 --> 14:21.368
I moved here and started
running the Gagosian.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.370
The art gallery.

14:23.412 --> 14:25.414
- Oh.
- It was a blast.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.457
But you really... you can't
do that sort of thing

14:27.499 --> 14:28.792
when you're raising a child.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.587
The parties,
the schmoozing, the travel...

14:31.628 --> 14:33.463
Oh, excuse me...

14:33.463 --> 14:35.215
- Oh.
- Bitsy.

14:35.257 --> 14:36.842
- It's you.
- Bitsy.

14:36.883 --> 14:39.386
I've so been
meaning to call.

14:39.428 --> 14:41.638
Is there anything
at all I can do?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.515
Not unless you
know a hit man.

14:43.557 --> 14:45.976
That lawyer Jeanie Whitman
recommended was no help at all.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.603
I am so sorry.

14:47.644 --> 14:50.898
Turns out all our assets
are actually in Tucker's company's name.

14:50.939 --> 14:52.900
All I'm getting
is a million flat.

14:52.941 --> 14:55.235
That's appalling.

14:55.277 --> 14:59.781
If I'd known it would go this far,
I would have just turned a blind eye.

14:59.823 --> 15:03.076
Anyway, enjoy the rest
of your lunch before I ruin that too.

15:03.118 --> 15:05.662
I'll call you later
this week, sweetheart.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.628
Such a shame.

15:12.669 --> 15:15.881
But she should have seen it
coming... everyone else did.

15:15.923 --> 15:18.550
Anyway, where were we?
Ah yes.

15:18.592 --> 15:21.136
After Gagosian,

15:21.178 --> 15:23.805
I met Mr. X.

15:26.183 --> 15:28.644
You know, my grandmother
worked as a domestic

15:28.685 --> 15:30.354
so we wouldn't have to.

15:30.395 --> 15:32.564
And here you are,
fresh out of college

15:32.606 --> 15:35.025
voluntarily taking
a nanny gig.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.778
I told you, this is not
a lifelong commitment.

15:37.819 --> 15:40.530
Okay? It's just a way
for me to get my head together.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.324
Besides,
the money is great.

15:42.366 --> 15:44.493
I finally get to
move to the city.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.204
I'm moving to the city
to go to grad school,

15:47.246 --> 15:48.872
not to be somebody's
servant.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.416
Plus you know you're wrong,
or you wouldn't be lying to your mother.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.961
This is all just
happening too fast.

15:54.002 --> 15:57.339
I don't understand why you can't
just live at the house for a while,

15:57.381 --> 15:58.674
just to get on your feet.

15:58.715 --> 16:00.676
Mom, I lived at home through
four years of college.

16:00.717 --> 16:02.052
Don't you think
that's long enough?

16:02.094 --> 16:03.845
Well, how could you find
a decent apartment so fast?

16:03.887 --> 16:07.015
The bank has, you know,
an excellent program.

16:07.057 --> 16:09.184
They got me hooked up with
a trainee, which is great.

16:09.226 --> 16:11.061
I'm getting in
the car.

16:11.061 --> 16:12.854
Can I come with you?

16:12.896 --> 16:15.607
I would feel a lot better if I could
at least see where you were living.

16:15.649 --> 16:17.693
Come on. The other
trainees, you know,

16:17.734 --> 16:20.195
they went to fancy
boarding schools

16:20.237 --> 16:21.780
and European exchange
programs.

16:21.822 --> 16:25.200
I show up with my mom,
I'll just look like a big dork.

16:25.242 --> 16:27.411
Guess that makes sense.

16:27.411 --> 16:28.912
Come here.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.247
I love you.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.624
Let me know the minute
I can visit you.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.543
I'll call you when
I get there, okay?

16:37.629 --> 16:40.591
#Freedom, freedom... #

16:40.632 --> 16:42.384
Hey, you're gonna
get me a ticket.

16:42.426 --> 16:44.845
# Freedom #

16:44.886 --> 16:47.222
# You got to give
what you take... #

16:47.264 --> 16:50.309
- You're crazy.
- # Freedom #

16:50.350 --> 16:52.978
- # Freedom... #
- Sing it again.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.397
# Freedom #

16:55.439 --> 16:58.567
#You got to give what you take. #

17:01.320 --> 17:03.488
I love that song.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.242
I'm telling you, like the bees,

17:07.326 --> 17:09.411
you're free, girl.

17:09.453 --> 17:10.954
That's okay, I'll
take care of it, miss.

17:10.996 --> 17:12.789
Oh, thank you.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.665
I can't believe this.
I could get used to this.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.586
- I'm telling you that.
- Thank God I'm getting a shrink degree.

17:17.627 --> 17:20.339
You know, I love you,
but you're harsh.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.089
A little bit.

17:22.132 --> 17:24.593
Just give me a hug.

17:24.635 --> 17:28.387
Mwah! I'll see
you soon, I'm sure.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.848
Annie?

17:31.350 --> 17:34.436
You know the path
of least resistance?

17:34.478 --> 17:36.313
It can lead through
a minefield.

17:44.321 --> 17:45.906
Oh, hi.

17:45.948 --> 17:48.367
You are the new nanny?

17:48.408 --> 17:51.119
Yes, and you must
be Maria.

17:51.161 --> 17:53.413
- Nice to meet you.
- Hmm.

17:53.455 --> 17:55.582
Can I come in?

17:55.624 --> 17:57.501
Okay.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.211
Leave it there.

17:59.253 --> 18:00.796
The floor is clean.

18:00.837 --> 18:02.839
Mmm.

18:08.178 --> 18:09.596
Wow.

18:09.638 --> 18:12.641
This place is
incredible.

18:12.683 --> 18:16.270
I hope you last longer
than the last one.

18:16.311 --> 18:18.021
Who, Bertie?
Oh yeah.

18:18.021 --> 18:20.023
Mrs. X told me that she
left to get married.

18:20.023 --> 18:22.985
Married? She had one date
and she get fired.

18:25.737 --> 18:29.032
Oh, Maria? Are you gonna tell
Mrs. X that I've arrived?

18:29.032 --> 18:31.034
Mrs. X is shopping.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.036
But she left you
a note on the table.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.622
Now I have to go run
the vacuum, okay?

18:35.664 --> 18:37.708
Ay...

18:50.637 --> 18:52.055
"Dear Nanny,

18:52.097 --> 18:54.057
welcome!"

18:54.099 --> 18:56.226
Please make note that from here on in,

18:56.268 --> 18:59.897
I'm referred to as "Nanny" by all
the people in the Xs' social network.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.816
I'm so excited to have you onboard.

19:02.858 --> 19:05.777
Please make yourself
completely at home.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.530
Manuel is making you
your own set of keys.

19:08.572 --> 19:10.532
Mmm.
- You should have them by tomorrow.

19:10.574 --> 19:12.326
The fridge
is well-stocked.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.036
Tofu cutlets?

19:14.077 --> 19:16.246
- Ugh.
- Help yourself to anything.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.581
Yuck.

19:17.581 --> 19:20.000
Sorry I could not
be there to meet you

19:20.042 --> 19:22.628
but I'm trying to squeeze
in a little shopping

19:22.669 --> 19:24.630
before my
Parents' Society meeting,

19:24.671 --> 19:26.506
which reminds me...

19:26.548 --> 19:28.967
please pick Grayer up
from the Christian preschool...

19:29.009 --> 19:30.761
- Wow!
...at 2:15 sharp.

19:30.761 --> 19:33.472
It's extremely important
not to be late.

19:33.513 --> 19:34.765
Ooh.

19:34.806 --> 19:36.183
As you can see,

19:36.224 --> 19:38.602
I have attached a list
of basic house rules.

19:38.602 --> 19:41.396
Hello, Manolo.
- We believe it's important

19:41.438 --> 19:44.942
to maintain some sense
of structure in our home

19:44.942 --> 19:46.610
for Grayer's sake.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.237
Rule number one:

19:48.278 --> 19:50.948
Grayer and his playmates
are never allowed

19:50.989 --> 19:52.991
- in the master bedroom.
- Oops.

19:52.991 --> 19:56.411
Of course, you should refrain from
entering our bedroom as well.

19:56.453 --> 19:58.330
Rule number two:

19:58.372 --> 20:00.624
Grayer is never allowed
to nap during the day.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.959
No naps?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.211
This throws his sleeping
schedule completely off.

20:04.253 --> 20:07.172
And I prefer him tired
when I get home.

20:09.633 --> 20:11.510
Rule number three:

20:11.551 --> 20:14.012
- we just had the walls redone.
- Mm-hm.

20:14.054 --> 20:16.181
Please keep Grayer from
rubbing up against them.

20:16.223 --> 20:17.975
- Oh!
- Rule number four:

20:18.016 --> 20:20.686
if school is
ever canceled,

20:20.727 --> 20:23.772
the following nonstructured
outings are permissible...

20:23.814 --> 20:25.983
the Met,

20:26.024 --> 20:27.693
the Morgan Library,

20:27.734 --> 20:29.903
the French
Culinary Institute,

20:29.945 --> 20:31.947
the New York
Stock Exchange.

20:31.989 --> 20:33.657
Rule number five!

20:33.699 --> 20:36.326
- we do not take
the subway because of germs.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.287
Oh God.

20:38.328 --> 20:40.581
Grayer still must
be in a stroller

20:40.622 --> 20:42.791
- when crossing Park or Madison.
- Blah blah blah.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.377
Grayer maintains

20:45.419 --> 20:47.421
a high-soy
organic diet.

20:47.462 --> 20:48.964
Rule number eight:

20:49.047 --> 20:52.259
practice French with Grayer
at least three times a week.

20:52.301 --> 20:54.803
His father wants him to
attend Collegiate

20:54.845 --> 20:56.555
where he's currently
wait-listed.

20:56.597 --> 20:58.599
French?
Holy merde.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.851
His acceptance is
a top priority.

21:00.851 --> 21:03.020
Mon Dieu.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.022
Nanny?

21:07.482 --> 21:09.943
Nanny?

21:09.985 --> 21:11.612
- What are you doing?
- The note said

21:11.653 --> 21:13.989
to pick up Grayer
from school at 2:15.

21:14.031 --> 21:15.073
Hm.

21:15.115 --> 21:17.034
And it's only...
it's only 1:00.

21:17.034 --> 21:20.871
So I was a little sweaty from moving
and I thought that I would, you know...

21:20.913 --> 21:24.541
What I mean is, what are you
doing in that bathtub?

21:24.583 --> 21:27.628
And why are your bags

21:27.669 --> 21:29.838
strewn all over
the guest room?

21:29.880 --> 21:33.050
I thought that
was my room.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.176
No.

21:36.136 --> 21:37.721
No, Nanny.

21:39.723 --> 21:41.725
This is your room.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.727
Oh.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.021
Okay.

21:46.063 --> 21:48.523
Yeah, this is...

21:48.565 --> 21:50.609
very sweet.

21:52.319 --> 21:54.154
Hmm.

22:04.456 --> 22:07.501
I'm sorry.
Do you have the time?

22:07.542 --> 22:09.670
2:15.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.588
So they'll be getting out
anytime now?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.924
- 2:45.
- I'm sorry?

22:13.924 --> 22:17.719
They get out
every day at 2:45.

22:17.761 --> 22:20.097
Dumbass.

22:22.015 --> 22:23.600
It quickly became clear

22:23.642 --> 22:26.270
that Mrs. X had arranged
for me to arrive everywhere

22:26.311 --> 22:28.313
torturously early.

22:30.941 --> 22:34.111
Get ready, ladies.
Here they come.

22:41.785 --> 22:43.870
Grayer?
Grayer?

22:45.789 --> 22:48.542
- Grayer X?
- Who is it you're looking for?

22:48.584 --> 22:51.378
- Grayer.
- I know that one.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.880
He plays with my
wee monster, Darwin.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.174
- Hy-ya!
- Ow!

22:56.216 --> 22:58.176
Oh, Grayer,
there you are.

22:58.218 --> 23:00.137
Hey, little man,
you remember me?

23:00.178 --> 23:01.930
Yes, and I hate you!

23:01.972 --> 23:04.808
What? Come on, we get
along great, remember?

23:04.850 --> 23:07.060
Like when we met
in Central Park?

23:07.102 --> 23:08.896
Let me get
your backpack.

23:08.937 --> 23:10.898
Stop. Grayer, stop.

23:10.939 --> 23:12.941
Help, police! She's hurting me!

23:12.983 --> 23:15.193
- They usually start out that way.
- Yes.

23:15.235 --> 23:17.112
- Danger, danger!
- Just be patient, eh?

23:17.154 --> 23:19.072
- Let me put you in your stroller, okay?
- It'll get easier.

23:19.114 --> 23:20.866
- Hang on one second.
- I'm too big for a stroller!

23:20.908 --> 23:22.242
- Grayer!
- Help!

23:22.284 --> 23:23.702
- Grayer!
- Police.

23:23.744 --> 23:26.538
Grayer!
Grayer!

23:26.580 --> 23:28.916
Grayer!
Come here!

23:28.957 --> 23:31.293
- I hate you, I want Bertie!
- I know, honey.

23:31.335 --> 23:33.545
I know you want Bertie.
Bertie had to leave to get married

23:33.587 --> 23:35.380
or go on a date
or something, okay?

23:35.422 --> 23:37.841
But I promise, we're gonna have a lot
of fun together, honestly.

23:37.883 --> 23:42.012
All right? Now let me see how handsome
you look in your uniform.

23:42.012 --> 23:43.597
What's that?

23:44.890 --> 23:46.725
- Oh.
- Don't touch that!

23:46.767 --> 23:50.229
It belongs to my daddy!
I hate you. I want Bertie.

23:50.270 --> 23:51.939
Grayer.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.565
Already, one had to wonder...

23:53.607 --> 23:56.568
what kind of culture would
turn a father's business card

23:56.568 --> 23:58.487
into a security blanket?

23:58.528 --> 24:00.530
Here we are.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.867
Home sweet home.
First mission accomplished.

24:05.535 --> 24:08.705
Grayer, get up off the floor.
It's very dirty.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.040
Nuh-uh.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.459
I have an idea.

24:12.501 --> 24:14.294
Why don't we race
to the front door?

24:14.336 --> 24:16.255
Okay, last one there is
a rotten egg.

24:16.296 --> 24:18.924
I'm not stupid.
You're just gonna let me win.

24:18.966 --> 24:21.551
No, I am a mighty
good runner, mister.

24:21.551 --> 24:23.929
- Not with your pants down.
- Oh my God!

24:25.847 --> 24:28.600
Oh shit!
The stroller!

24:34.648 --> 24:36.775
Shit!
Grayer!

24:36.817 --> 24:39.278
You said a curse.
I'm telling Mommy.

24:39.319 --> 24:42.072
Grayer, I am not kidding.
Open this door right now.

24:43.532 --> 24:45.325
- Maria!
- Touch my fingers.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.204
- Ow!
- I am not letting go...

24:49.246 --> 24:50.872
...until you open the door!

24:50.914 --> 24:52.124
Ow!

24:54.918 --> 24:56.169
Pardon me.

25:00.173 --> 25:02.175
I think this belongs
to Grayer.

25:02.217 --> 25:04.261
Rode the elevator to
the 12th floor.

25:04.261 --> 25:06.722
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:06.763 --> 25:08.724
Sorry, we're having a little
bit of a situation here.

25:13.478 --> 25:15.272
By the way, my name's...

25:15.272 --> 25:18.150
Since my job required a vow of chastity,

25:18.191 --> 25:20.652
it was essential that
I avoided all intimacies,

25:20.694 --> 25:22.321
especially first names.

25:22.362 --> 25:24.531
For the purpose of
this field diary,

25:24.573 --> 25:27.034
let's just call him
Harvard Hottie.

25:27.075 --> 25:29.119
I'm the Xs' new nanny.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.956
- Oh.
- Very new, as you can probably tell.

25:32.998 --> 25:36.793
I'm taking off all my clothes.

25:36.793 --> 25:39.713
Seems to be popular
on this floor.

25:41.089 --> 25:43.675
Mind if I take a crack
at him for you?

25:43.717 --> 25:46.678
Be my guest.

25:46.678 --> 25:50.057
Hey, Grayer,
it's your pal from upstairs.

25:50.098 --> 25:53.018
Hey, would you be a sport
and unlock the door?

25:53.060 --> 25:55.771
It's not nice to
lock people out.

25:55.812 --> 25:57.814
Please, buddy?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.528
- Hey.
- Why are you here?

26:03.570 --> 26:07.741
Oh, I'm just helping out
my new friend.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.285
Annie.

26:10.327 --> 26:12.746
Annie.
Annie the nanny.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.998
She's your friend?

26:15.040 --> 26:18.585
Yes, she's my friend.
Isn't she your friend too?

26:18.627 --> 26:21.004
Not yet.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.182
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.812
Suddenly the world's
most notorious loner

26:36.853 --> 26:38.981
had two new men
in her life.

26:39.022 --> 26:43.402
Unfortunately, I knew that
the big one was off-limits.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.320
Based on my observations,

26:45.362 --> 26:48.240
guys like Harvard Hottie
only slum it when they're in college.

26:48.282 --> 26:50.617
So, instead of
following my heart,

26:50.659 --> 26:53.829
I focused on finding a way
into Grayer's.

27:04.131 --> 27:07.175
Grayer, stop it.

27:07.217 --> 27:10.304
# Why can't we
be friends? #

27:10.345 --> 27:12.139
Befriending Grayer

27:12.180 --> 27:14.308
certainly wasn't easy.

27:17.686 --> 27:19.271
La la la la la la!

27:19.313 --> 27:21.565
But then again, Margaret Mead
didn't run home every time

27:21.607 --> 27:24.443
- she contracted malaria.
- Whoa!

27:24.484 --> 27:26.528
You're in trouble!

27:26.570 --> 27:28.697
I thought this job
was supposed to be

27:28.739 --> 27:30.490
a way to get
your head together?

27:30.532 --> 27:33.785
Two weeks in and you already sound
depressed, dejected and paranoid.

27:33.827 --> 27:36.163
You forgot to mention
malnourished.

27:36.204 --> 27:38.957
I swear, all these people eat
is bean curd and seltzer.

27:38.999 --> 27:40.208
Ew.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.960
I mean, even the ice cream
is made out of tofu.

27:42.002 --> 27:44.379
So why don't you come down
and have dinner with us then?

27:44.421 --> 27:47.382
My new roomie's
making gumbo.

27:47.424 --> 27:49.885
It's not gumbo.
It's Creole bouillabaisse.

27:49.927 --> 27:51.845
I don't get it.

27:51.887 --> 27:55.098
You move to the city and overnight
your life becomes "Will & Grace."

27:55.140 --> 27:56.767
I'm here, knee-deep in...

27:56.808 --> 27:59.102
Shit. It's probably my mom.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.437
She's the only one
who has this number.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.605
Bye.

28:01.647 --> 28:04.566
- Hello?
- Annie?

28:04.608 --> 28:06.276
- Hi.
- My God.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.071
An entire week has gone by
and you haven't called me back.

28:09.112 --> 28:11.615
Mom, I told you I was gonna
be so busy with work.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.742
Oh come on.
You can't find five minutes

28:13.784 --> 28:15.285
to call
your worried mother?

28:15.327 --> 28:16.912
How are you, honey?

28:16.954 --> 28:18.997
How's the job?
How's the apartment?

28:19.039 --> 28:22.292
God, everything
is just perfect.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.962
I mean, the job
is a dream.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.464
A little challenging.
So rewarding though.

28:27.464 --> 28:30.592
And the apartment is
just incredible.

28:30.634 --> 28:33.762
- Yeah?
- And my roommate could not be nicer.

28:33.804 --> 28:35.180
Nanny, in the morning,

28:35.180 --> 28:37.015
I need you to stop at Tiffany's
and pick up Mr. X's watch.

28:37.057 --> 28:39.226
Then I need you to Xerox
the recommendation letters

28:39.268 --> 28:41.019
for Grayer's Collegiate
application.

28:41.061 --> 28:44.189
Also, I was thinking, we should
introduce French food into his diet.

28:44.231 --> 28:46.692
It might enhance his study
of the language. So tomorrow night,

28:46.692 --> 28:49.611
why don't you make him
coquilles St. Jacques for dinner, hmm?

28:49.653 --> 28:51.738
- Annie?
- Dry cleaning.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.783
Who was that,
your roommate?

28:54.825 --> 28:57.119
Mom, I have to go.
I have some work stuff to take care of.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.663
Wait a minute.
I want to make a plan to visit.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.790
Ann...

29:18.807 --> 29:21.768
Hi, ladies.

29:21.810 --> 29:24.813
So I took Madison to
the doctor this morning.

29:24.855 --> 29:26.815
She had grown three
inches in six months.

29:26.857 --> 29:29.234
You take her to
the doctor too?

29:29.276 --> 29:32.321
Darling, I do everything.
My job is a type C.

29:32.362 --> 29:34.656
- Mmm.
- Type C? What's type C?

29:34.698 --> 29:37.576
Oh Jesus.
Okay, newbie.

29:37.618 --> 29:39.912
Pay attention, honey.
Basically,

29:39.953 --> 29:42.873
there's three types of nanny gigs.
Okay, type A,

29:42.915 --> 29:46.752
you provide "couple time"
a few nights a week

29:46.752 --> 29:49.838
for women who work all day
and parent at night.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.007
Type B, you provide

29:52.049 --> 29:54.635
"sanity time,"
every afternoon, right,

29:54.676 --> 29:57.471
to a woman who mothers in
the mornings and the evenings.

29:57.512 --> 29:59.640
And type C,
the most common,

29:59.681 --> 30:02.392
you provide 24-7
"me time"

30:02.434 --> 30:05.520
to the woman who neither
works nor mothers.

30:05.562 --> 30:08.148
So, which one are you?

30:08.190 --> 30:10.108
I am type C,

30:10.108 --> 30:13.445
no question.
Although when I started I had no idea.

30:13.487 --> 30:17.282
I thought it would be
a kind of fun and easy job.

30:17.324 --> 30:19.910
You'd think
a college graduate

30:19.952 --> 30:22.579
would choose a job
a little more wisely.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.374
Actually, this job
kind of chose me.

30:25.415 --> 30:28.335
Chose you?

30:28.377 --> 30:31.505
Please, child.
I left my country

30:31.546 --> 30:34.758
because I thought I could give my boy
and my sick mother a better life.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.428
I was supposed to be here
two or three years tops.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.056
And while I've been raising
these strangers' children,

30:41.098 --> 30:45.269
my own child has grown up
without a mother.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.437
That's how this job
chose me.

30:57.364 --> 31:00.284
Half a tablespoon
of tarragon.

31:05.581 --> 31:07.833
That's dried.
I like fresh.

31:07.874 --> 31:11.378
Well, you know what?
Dried's all we got, okay, kiddo?

31:11.420 --> 31:14.256
I hate coquilles dry.
I want sushi.

31:14.298 --> 31:16.842
Well, then tell your mother
you want to learn Japanese.

31:16.883 --> 31:18.135
Mmm!

31:18.176 --> 31:20.095
Okay.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.020
Ah!

31:28.061 --> 31:31.982
I'm telling Mommy.
You're in trouble.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.192
Okay.

31:35.903 --> 31:38.864
That's it.

31:42.618 --> 31:45.621
No, Mommy says they're full
of high-fructose corn syrup.

31:45.662 --> 31:48.290
Well, what mommy doesn't know
won't hurt her, okay, Mr. Tattletale?

31:48.332 --> 31:50.918
Eat it.
Go on.

31:50.959 --> 31:52.961
Right out of the jar.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.227
It's okay.

32:09.811 --> 32:11.230
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

32:11.271 --> 32:13.815
- It's yummy, isn't it?
- This is fun.

32:13.857 --> 32:17.194
Yeah?
This is fun. This is fun.

32:17.194 --> 32:21.490
And this fun meal has to
be our little secret, okay?

32:21.531 --> 32:23.492
Okay.

32:23.533 --> 32:24.701
Okay.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.539
Hey, you know, we can do
lots of fun things.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.125
We just have to be friends
and we have to trust each other.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.336
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.299
Maybe you should have
a secret name too?

32:39.341 --> 32:41.677
- You want a secret name?
- Yeah, I want a secret name.

32:41.718 --> 32:43.845
Okay.

32:43.887 --> 32:46.598
How about Sponge Bob?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.267
- No, silly.
- No?

32:49.935 --> 32:53.772
All right, what about...
what about Grover?

32:53.772 --> 32:55.524
Grover,
I love Grover.

32:55.566 --> 32:59.069
You do?
All right. Grover it is.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.742
Where's my little munchkin?

33:05.784 --> 33:07.536
- Daddy! Daddy's home.
- Huh?

33:07.578 --> 33:11.582
- Yay, Daddy. Daddy's home.
- I hear him, I hear him.

33:11.582 --> 33:13.834
- Daddy!
- Oh, there he is!

33:13.875 --> 33:15.794
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.
Are you a little monster?

33:15.836 --> 33:17.671
Remember what happens
to little monsters?

33:17.713 --> 33:19.006
- Come here for a minute.
- No, Daddy!

33:19.047 --> 33:21.425
You remember?
What's wrong with you?

33:21.466 --> 33:23.051
- Daddy!
- Come here for a minute.

33:23.093 --> 33:25.721
You get viciously tickled.
You remember that?

33:25.762 --> 33:27.180
- Daddy, stop it.
- Huh? Hey.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.932
- You my little superstar?
- Yeah.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.268
Are you? Are you gonna
take over the world?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.395
Come on, answer me.
You gonna take over the world?

33:33.478 --> 33:35.439
- Yes.
- And when are you gonna do it?

33:35.480 --> 33:37.691
- Next year.
- Next year's not soon enough.

33:37.733 --> 33:40.777
Well, you must be Mr. X.
I'm the new nanny.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.322
Yeah. Keep him
quiet tonight, will you?

33:43.363 --> 33:45.032
I've got a merger
I'm working on.

33:45.073 --> 33:46.742
I don't get some
decent shut-eye tonight,

33:46.783 --> 33:48.452
somebody around here's
gonna be accountable.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.287
Daddy, come see
my dinosaur!

33:50.329 --> 33:52.831
- Daddy's got work to do, buddy.
- Please?

33:57.419 --> 34:00.505
Hey, Grayer, don't...
don't be sad. It's okay.

34:00.547 --> 34:03.634
Daddy's just tired.

34:05.093 --> 34:07.137
Grover.

34:09.556 --> 34:12.141
Hey, you want to
finish our fun meal?

34:12.184 --> 34:15.228
Come on!

34:15.270 --> 34:17.231
Yeah.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.443
# FrÃ¨re Jacques #

34:21.485 --> 34:23.152
# FrÃ¨re Jacques #

34:23.195 --> 34:26.822
# Dormez vous,
dormez vous #

34:26.864 --> 34:30.452
# Sonnez les matines,
sonnez les matines. #

34:30.494 --> 34:32.161
Nanny?

34:32.204 --> 34:33.538
Yeah, Grover?

34:35.831 --> 34:38.918
You'll never leave me
like Bertie, will you?

34:43.507 --> 34:46.342
- Grover, you know I...
- Promise?

34:49.846 --> 34:53.350
I'm not going anywhere.
You know that, right, honey?

34:56.562 --> 34:58.730
Right, Grove?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.123
# Oh beautiful... #

35:16.206 --> 35:17.916
Dear Nanny,

35:17.958 --> 35:20.586
please remember that
today is the 4th of July family party

35:20.627 --> 35:22.296
at Mr. X's office.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.465
It probably slipped your mind
that costumes are required,

35:25.507 --> 35:28.719
so I took it upon myself
to have some delivered.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.722
- This is itchy.
- I know, sweetheart.

35:31.722 --> 35:34.433
Why do we have to
dress up?

35:34.474 --> 35:36.476
Freedom, Grove.

35:36.518 --> 35:39.062
It's all in the name
of freedom.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.148
Hey, guys.

35:41.189 --> 35:43.567
- Who is that?
- That's the nanny, dear.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.153
- You've met her.
- What happened to Louisa?

35:47.613 --> 35:50.741
That was two nannies
ago, silly.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.286
- Yeah.
- Daddy, I'm George Washington.

35:54.328 --> 35:55.871
- Okay.
- Tickle me.

35:55.913 --> 35:58.040
No, I understand that,
Dan, because the bastard's selling low.

35:58.081 --> 36:00.042
- Please!
- Grayer, come on, buddy.

36:00.083 --> 36:02.044
Cut it out, sit down.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.546
- Yes yes, we're coming.
- No, it's just my kid.

36:04.588 --> 36:06.214
- We're coming.
- Right.

36:06.256 --> 36:08.383
- Well no, that's what I was thinking...
- You want me to call...

36:08.425 --> 36:10.969
Where's my card! Daddy!
- Your what?

36:11.011 --> 36:13.805
Where's my card!
Oh, I wanna go home!

36:13.847 --> 36:15.599
Hey, smile, Grove.
We're gonna go to a party.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.727
That's not my card.
Where's my card?

36:18.769 --> 36:20.562
Would you get off that phone

36:20.604 --> 36:22.814
and tell the nanny to
give him his damn card?

36:22.856 --> 36:25.734
Nanny?
Turn the car around.

36:25.776 --> 36:27.945
- Talk to the nanny, please.
- Nanny, go back and get the card.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.530
Hold the elevator!

36:36.787 --> 36:38.914
I'm sorry.

36:38.956 --> 36:41.959
It's okay, don't be.
At least I'm fully dressed this time.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.086
So...

36:45.796 --> 36:47.422
I'm so sorry.
It's not funny.

36:47.464 --> 36:50.092
I don't mean to be laughing.

36:50.133 --> 36:52.219
You look very
patriotic.

36:52.261 --> 36:53.971
- Yeah.
- Let me hit your floor.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.472
Oh, that's okay.
I got it.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.433
Didn't grow up with the staff
doing everything for me,

36:58.475 --> 37:00.852
- so...
- Neither did I.

37:02.312 --> 37:04.439
Really? You must have had
it really rough then.

37:04.481 --> 37:08.235
Okay, well, I'm glad
to give you a good laugh.

37:20.831 --> 37:23.875
My husband and I are
taking our second honeymoon

37:23.917 --> 37:25.961
in Provence.

37:27.796 --> 37:29.923
# When I dance they
call me Macarena #

37:29.965 --> 37:32.342
# And the boys,
they say that I'm buena #

37:32.384 --> 37:34.720
# They all want me,
they can't have me #

37:34.761 --> 37:37.306
# So they all come
and dance beside me #

37:37.347 --> 37:39.474
# Move with me,
jam with me... #

37:41.351 --> 37:43.687
I'm looking for Mr. X.
Have you seen him?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.772
No, sorry.

37:45.814 --> 37:47.816
Wouldn't know him if I did.

37:47.858 --> 37:50.193
# Macarena,
hey, Macarena... #

37:50.193 --> 37:53.238
Grove, come on. What is wrong?
Why won't you shake your booty?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.282
'Cause I have to
make a doodie.

37:55.324 --> 37:57.326
Oh.
Come on.

38:07.544 --> 38:09.880
Hey, Grover, I think
the bathroom's the other way.

38:09.922 --> 38:12.341
- My daddy has one in his office.
- Yeah?

38:12.382 --> 38:14.801
- I wanna go to my daddy's bathroom.
- Okay.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.478
- Oh.
- Why is Daddy tickling that lady?

38:24.519 --> 38:26.313
I'm sorry.

38:26.355 --> 38:28.523
Grayer just had to use
the bathroom.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.903
So use it already.

38:34.821 --> 38:37.616
Hello, Grayer.
Remember me?

38:37.658 --> 38:39.618
I work with your daddy
in the Chicago office.

38:39.660 --> 38:42.496
Let go.
I have to make a doodie.

38:42.537 --> 38:43.872
Oh.

38:48.627 --> 38:51.964
So, you must
be the nanny.

38:52.005 --> 38:55.425
Uh, yes, I...

38:55.467 --> 38:59.388
I'll get out of your...
I'll wait in the hall.

39:02.891 --> 39:04.518
So sorry.

39:11.733 --> 39:13.777
Grayer, hurry up.
Your mom's coming.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.072
Sweetie, did Grayer hear
from the waiting-list committee yet?

39:17.114 --> 39:18.865
No, why?

39:18.907 --> 39:20.784
Oh, I'm sure it
doesn't mean anything,

39:20.784 --> 39:22.536
but the Bairds did
and Darwin got in.

39:26.999 --> 39:30.419
Please don't say anything about
Collegiate or Darwin to my husband.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.421
Sure.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.302
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.
- There you are.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.762
Oh, you've met before
in Chicago, right?

39:40.804 --> 39:42.222
- Yes, hello.
- Lovely to see you.

39:42.264 --> 39:44.349
- Nice to see you as well.
- Excuse me. Thanks again.

39:44.391 --> 39:46.101
- Mm-hm.
- Where have you been?

39:46.143 --> 39:47.895
Making calls.
Where's the chow?

39:47.936 --> 39:49.855
- The entire time?
- Yeah.

39:54.902 --> 39:58.322
Male monogamy remains an elusive,

39:58.322 --> 40:00.574
yet much
mythologized practice

40:00.616 --> 40:02.242
throughout the world.

40:02.284 --> 40:04.745
In many Bedouin tribes,

40:04.786 --> 40:08.498
powerful men are encouraged
to take multiple wives.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.627
In contemporary France,

40:11.668 --> 40:13.587
mistresses are de rigueur

40:13.629 --> 40:16.131
and quietly tolerated.

40:16.173 --> 40:18.800
But for the women
of the Upper East Side,

40:18.842 --> 40:22.846
adultery is
pathologically ignored.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.559
Nobody warned me we were going
to have a therapy session.

40:27.601 --> 40:30.479
It's just that I didn't
see you at all at the party.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.482
Well, I was trying to
sneak in a little work.

40:33.523 --> 40:36.193
Okay? Forgive me
for making a living.

40:36.235 --> 40:39.821
But everybody else
was participating.

40:39.863 --> 40:44.284
Everybody else doesn't pull
down what I do every year.

40:44.326 --> 40:47.204
I had my family there
and I was present and accounted for.

40:47.204 --> 40:50.207
So now, you know, I would really
appreciate a moment of peace and quiet.

40:50.249 --> 40:51.792
'Cause frankly,
I'm exhausted.

40:54.127 --> 40:56.338
Bonjour, Pierre.

40:56.380 --> 40:58.423
Bonjour.

40:58.465 --> 41:01.760
Comment allez-vous?

41:04.888 --> 41:06.181
Bien, merci.

41:06.223 --> 41:08.016
Et vous?

41:08.058 --> 41:11.603
Ah, comme ci comme Ã§a.

41:15.232 --> 41:17.276
Okay, I got
a great idea.

41:17.317 --> 41:21.280
Let's pretend that
we're in a cave.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.699
You know what, Nanny?

41:23.740 --> 41:25.367
What, Grove?

41:25.409 --> 41:27.828
I love you best.

41:29.913 --> 41:32.874
The other nannies
had warned me about this very moment,

41:32.916 --> 41:34.876
the moment when you'll
be tempted to break

41:34.960 --> 41:36.920
the cardinal rule
of nannydom.

41:36.962 --> 41:41.842
And yet, staring into those big,
sad, searching eyes,

41:41.884 --> 41:44.887
I simply couldn't resist.

41:44.928 --> 41:47.264
I love you too, Grove.

41:49.308 --> 41:53.729
Three little words made leaving
this job 1,000 times harder.

41:53.770 --> 41:55.522
...hear a thing I have to say!

41:55.564 --> 41:58.191
I know that you work hard.
I just think

41:58.233 --> 42:02.613
that if... if we're
gonna have more children...

42:02.654 --> 42:05.741
Well, maybe you should
focus on the one you already have.

42:05.782 --> 42:08.869
'Cause you can barely
handle him as it is.

42:10.370 --> 42:12.414
Why are you
so cruel to me?

42:12.456 --> 42:14.249
- Why?
- Why are you so cruel?

42:14.291 --> 42:16.960
Because I cannot take
the additional pressure.

42:17.002 --> 42:20.297
You know something? I think that
I am going to go out to Chicago

42:20.339 --> 42:22.841
- until this merger is finished.
- Will you stop it, please?

42:22.841 --> 42:25.677
And I certainly hope that
you're in a better mood...

42:25.719 --> 42:29.014
- Please, stop it.
...when I come back. All right?

42:29.056 --> 42:31.225
If I come back!

42:44.780 --> 42:48.825
Nanny, this is yours,
is it not?

42:54.039 --> 42:57.125
Uh... no, l...

42:57.167 --> 42:58.961
no, I don't know
what that is.

42:59.002 --> 43:02.047
It was in our laundry.

43:02.089 --> 43:05.175
It is not mine,
it is not Mr. X's,

43:05.217 --> 43:07.886
so it has to be yours,
right?

43:09.388 --> 43:12.015
Right?

43:12.057 --> 43:14.059
Yes, it's mine.

43:16.103 --> 43:19.231
Please don't leave your personal items
lying around the house again.

43:21.024 --> 43:22.943
l... I won't.

43:22.985 --> 43:25.654
- I promise. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

43:35.414 --> 43:37.916
I don't mean...

43:37.958 --> 43:40.836
to be a control freak.

43:44.548 --> 43:49.386
It's... it's just that when Mr. X
is in the middle of a big deal,

43:49.428 --> 43:51.722
it can be very hard on me.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.727
I understand.

44:08.697 --> 44:11.617
How is Grayer doing?

44:11.658 --> 44:13.827
Grayer?

44:13.869 --> 44:16.705
He's... he's fine.

44:16.747 --> 44:19.249
He's great.

44:19.291 --> 44:21.168
That's good to hear.

44:21.209 --> 44:24.755
He really is
a wonderful child, isn't he?

44:28.842 --> 44:31.261
He's the best.

44:31.261 --> 44:34.223
He's...
he's such a sweet...

44:34.264 --> 44:36.391
Okay, good night then.

44:42.522 --> 44:44.650
Dear Nanny, I know it's Sunday

44:44.691 --> 44:46.235
and you requested
a day off,

44:46.276 --> 44:48.320
but I desperately need
to sleep in.

44:48.362 --> 44:50.572
I have a very long
afternoon today

44:50.614 --> 44:52.741
tasting caterers
for our benefit,

44:52.783 --> 44:55.452
"Conga for the Congo."
Please don't wake me

44:55.452 --> 44:57.871
unless Mr. X calls
from Chicago.

44:57.913 --> 44:59.498
And most importantly,

44:59.539 --> 45:02.000
find a way to
keep the boy quiet.

45:02.042 --> 45:04.169
Why don't they just
muzzle the kid already?

45:04.211 --> 45:05.671
What's a muzzle?

45:05.712 --> 45:09.424
Scrambled for you
and Cheerios for the boy.

45:09.466 --> 45:11.760
Mommy doesn't allow me
to eat sugar cereal.

45:11.802 --> 45:13.762
Cheerios are sugar-free.

45:13.804 --> 45:16.431
Low in sugar isn't
the same as sugar-free.

45:16.473 --> 45:18.058
Grover, just eat it.

45:21.353 --> 45:22.938
Is that caffeinated?

45:22.980 --> 45:24.982
Mommy doesn't
use caffeine.

45:25.023 --> 45:27.317
That's because Mommy
sleeps till noon.

45:27.359 --> 45:29.653
Perhaps it might be a nice morning

45:29.695 --> 45:31.905
to do something
educational with Grayer,

45:31.947 --> 45:33.991
like the Pissarro show
at the Guggenheim.

45:33.991 --> 45:36.827
Mommy said you're supposed to take
me to her favorite museum,

45:36.868 --> 45:38.245
the "Guggyheiny."

45:38.287 --> 45:39.997
Well, since today was
supposed to be my day off,

45:40.038 --> 45:42.624
we're gonna go to my favorite,
the Museum of Natural History.

45:42.666 --> 45:44.918
- Isn't that on the West Side?
- Yeah, so?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.963
I'm not allowed to go on the West Side.
That's a rule.

45:48.005 --> 45:51.675
Well, today just happens to
be break-the-rules day.

45:51.717 --> 45:53.886
Oh.

46:01.101 --> 46:03.478
Hi.
Two please.

46:34.384 --> 46:36.762
Hey, you know what
the biggest word in America is?

46:36.803 --> 46:37.930
What?

46:37.971 --> 46:41.141
Anti...
antidisestablishmentarianism.

46:41.183 --> 46:43.352
Hey, that's pretty good,
Grove.

46:43.393 --> 46:45.229
Actually, I know
a longer word.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.731
- There is no longer word.
- Yes, there is.

46:47.773 --> 46:50.275
Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious.

46:50.317 --> 46:52.527
Wow.
What does that mean?

46:52.569 --> 46:55.572
Come on inside.
Let me show you.

46:55.614 --> 46:58.867
"The apatosaurus, formerly
known as the brontosaurus,

46:58.909 --> 47:01.161
is from a family of
enormous herbivores."

47:01.203 --> 47:03.622
Herbivores means
vegetarian.

47:03.622 --> 47:05.415
Like Mommy,
you know?

47:05.457 --> 47:07.501
What's that over there?

47:10.337 --> 47:12.881
That is the T-rex.

47:12.923 --> 47:15.509
- Is that one like Mommy too?
- Hmm.

47:15.551 --> 47:18.345
I wish my ancestors
made totem poles.

47:18.387 --> 47:20.264
Well, they did.
That one looks just like you.

47:20.305 --> 47:21.473
It does.

47:21.515 --> 47:22.808
Well, that guy has
a big...

47:22.849 --> 47:25.060
It's hanging.

47:29.356 --> 47:31.316
Cool.
What are they?

47:31.358 --> 47:32.943
They're a Matis
family.

47:32.985 --> 47:34.945
They live in
the Amazon.

47:34.987 --> 47:37.364
Which one's the nanny?

47:37.406 --> 47:41.451
She has the day off. Things are
different in that part of the world.

47:43.161 --> 47:45.414
And Nanny, one last thing

47:45.455 --> 47:48.083
before you take
the rest of the day off:

47:48.125 --> 47:51.295
Do you think you could
manage a quick shop for me?

47:55.549 --> 47:57.509
- I'll help.
- No, it's okay, Grayer.

47:57.551 --> 48:00.012
Don't.
Grayer, don't... don't!

48:00.012 --> 48:01.722
God!

48:01.763 --> 48:03.765
Mommy!

48:03.807 --> 48:06.351
What a mess.

48:06.393 --> 48:09.146
Really, Nanny, I don't know
why you didn't leave all this

48:09.187 --> 48:11.273
downstairs with Manuel
to store.

48:11.315 --> 48:14.276
I mean, am I supposed to have this lying
around the apartment till the benefit?

48:14.318 --> 48:17.446
No no no, of course not. l... I'm gonna
bring it down to him right now.

48:17.487 --> 48:20.115
There's no time now.

48:20.157 --> 48:22.659
I need you to get ready for the Nanny
Conflict Resolution Seminar

48:22.701 --> 48:24.494
at the Parents' Society.

48:24.536 --> 48:27.289
I totally forgot
it was this evening.

48:27.331 --> 48:29.541
Um...

48:35.172 --> 48:37.633
Mrs. X, I...

48:37.674 --> 48:39.801
don't know
if you remember,

48:39.843 --> 48:42.012
but l... I was supposed
to have the evening off.

48:42.054 --> 48:44.473
And I made plans.

48:48.060 --> 48:50.145
The entire point of
the seminar

48:50.187 --> 48:52.189
is that everybody
brings their nanny.

48:53.607 --> 48:56.068
Are you suggesting
I attend it alone?

48:56.109 --> 48:58.570
Huh-uh. No.

48:58.570 --> 49:00.697
I was just...

49:00.739 --> 49:02.407
I was confused.

49:02.449 --> 49:06.161
So, I will
cancel my plans.

49:06.203 --> 49:08.580
I'd appreciate it.

49:13.126 --> 49:16.713
Does anyone have
an extra diaper I can use?

49:16.755 --> 49:19.508
Stop eating them boogers!

49:19.550 --> 49:22.928
Grayer, no nudity.
Please.

49:22.970 --> 49:25.097
Of course you feel anxiety

49:25.138 --> 49:27.766
when leaving
your kids with strangers.

49:27.808 --> 49:30.060
You're moms.
Okay...

49:30.102 --> 49:32.563
now what I would
love to do

49:32.604 --> 49:34.815
is bring in
the nannies.

49:34.856 --> 49:37.359
Linda, Gillian, would you
mind monitoring the children

49:37.401 --> 49:39.403
so that the nannies can
join us in here?

49:39.444 --> 49:41.905
Okay, listen, I want to see
you all here next week.

49:41.947 --> 49:44.449
The seminar is called
"Sexy Mom, Happy Mom."

49:44.449 --> 49:46.952
It's gonna be
a hot one.

49:46.994 --> 49:48.870
Nannies, we're ready.

49:48.912 --> 49:50.998
Right this way, ladies.

49:51.039 --> 49:53.542
All right, here they are...

49:53.584 --> 49:56.211
the nannies!
Wonderful. Come on in.

49:56.253 --> 49:59.715
Just... just file against this wall.
Just squeeze in.

49:59.756 --> 50:01.925
But... but be comfortable.

50:01.967 --> 50:04.761
Terrific.
Now that we're all together,

50:04.761 --> 50:07.598
I think it's time to address
the reason for this seminar:

50:07.639 --> 50:11.435
improving nanny-mom
communication.

50:11.476 --> 50:15.230
To begin, I would like
a mom volunteer

50:15.272 --> 50:17.941
to offer the group
one particular example

50:17.983 --> 50:19.943
of failed communication
with your nanny.

50:19.985 --> 50:21.987
Most of them
barely speak English.

50:22.029 --> 50:24.823
- That's the problem.
- Okay, you.

50:24.865 --> 50:27.618
My nanny keeps on singing
religious songs to Parker

50:27.659 --> 50:30.579
even though I have told her
time and time again that we're agnostic.

50:30.621 --> 50:33.123
And what's worse,
every time I confront her

50:33.165 --> 50:36.293
she flatly denies it,
even after I provided her

50:36.335 --> 50:38.003
with evidence
from the Nanny Cam.

50:38.045 --> 50:41.381
Nanny Cam?
I thought that was an urban myth.

50:41.423 --> 50:43.300
That's my nanny over there.

50:43.342 --> 50:46.303
Will you please ask her
if she's trying to convert my child?

50:46.345 --> 50:50.015
No. Right now we're
just hearing issues.

50:50.057 --> 50:54.019
Okay. Next I would like
to hear from a nanny.

50:54.061 --> 50:56.355
Can I have a nanny
volunteer?

50:56.396 --> 50:58.315
Anyone?

50:58.357 --> 50:59.900
Por favor?

50:59.942 --> 51:03.362
Come on,
don't be shy.

51:03.362 --> 51:06.615
We won't bite.

51:06.657 --> 51:08.825
Okay, how about you,
young lady?

51:08.867 --> 51:10.619
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

51:10.661 --> 51:14.206
Can you share with the group
one particular grievance

51:14.248 --> 51:17.501
that you might have
about your job?

51:17.542 --> 51:19.211
Come on.

51:19.253 --> 51:22.631
No no, l-l...
I love my job.

51:22.673 --> 51:25.676
I do. I feel...
I feel kinda lucky.

51:25.717 --> 51:27.511
Oh, that's very nice,

51:27.553 --> 51:29.805
but neither helpful
nor productive.

51:29.846 --> 51:33.016
So can you please offer
the class something useful? Come on.

51:34.851 --> 51:38.355
- Well...
- Yeah?

51:38.397 --> 51:41.942
It would be nice to
have a night off, I guess.

51:41.984 --> 51:43.986
Uh-huh.

51:44.069 --> 51:47.864
We... we have been a little
preoccupied with our benefit.

51:49.533 --> 51:51.410
But all she has to do
is ask.

51:51.451 --> 51:54.371
Uh-huh-huh-huh.
See, ladies?

51:54.371 --> 51:56.873
Conflict resolved.

52:06.842 --> 52:08.927
- I'm taking him.
- Oh no, I can take him.

52:08.969 --> 52:10.929
- No, it's all right.
- No, I can... I can take him.

52:10.971 --> 52:14.474
Nanny, please.
I want you to go out.

52:14.516 --> 52:17.394
It's only 9:00.
You clearly wanted the evening off.

52:17.436 --> 52:20.022
No... no, you must be
exhausted, let me put him to bed.

52:20.063 --> 52:22.316
We'll manage fine.
Here.

52:22.357 --> 52:24.359
Have a blast.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.621
I just don't understand it.

52:37.915 --> 52:41.251
l... I just don't understand
how someone can have everything

52:41.293 --> 52:43.545
and still be...

52:43.587 --> 52:46.173
so miserable.

52:47.507 --> 52:49.468
Anyway...

52:49.509 --> 52:52.971
remember I was telling you
I went to this orientation mixer thingy?

52:52.971 --> 52:55.599
I met this guy who
likes the same exact...

52:55.641 --> 52:59.478
It's like she dumps all of her problems
with her husband onto me.

52:59.519 --> 53:02.481
It's called denial.
Okay, like the river.

53:02.522 --> 53:05.234
And you obviously have
become her enabler.

53:05.275 --> 53:07.069
What? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

53:07.110 --> 53:09.738
It means, can you stop talking about
this woman for five minutes please?

53:09.780 --> 53:12.574
Well, I'm sorry I'm boring you, Lynette,
but this is my life right now.

53:12.616 --> 53:14.910
I have a life too,
in case you haven't noticed.

53:14.952 --> 53:17.496
And I'm starting to think
you and that lady

53:17.537 --> 53:19.331
are kindred spirits.

53:21.124 --> 53:23.794
You know what? NYU should give you
your diploma right now.

53:23.835 --> 53:25.879
- You've got all the answers.
- Okay okay.

53:25.921 --> 53:28.382
Okay, let's forget that...
forget that.

53:28.423 --> 53:31.468
Can we at least try
to have a good time?

53:31.510 --> 53:33.804
Since you did drag me
above 14th Street.

53:33.845 --> 53:34.888
Mmh.

53:36.682 --> 53:38.433
Come on, Annie.
This place,

53:38.475 --> 53:40.185
you have to admit,
it's...

53:40.227 --> 53:42.104
hmm, tired.

53:42.145 --> 53:44.481
Look at these guys
over there.

53:44.523 --> 53:46.900
They don't have
any piercings,

53:46.942 --> 53:48.277
no tattoos.
I mean...

53:48.318 --> 53:49.820
Oh my God.

53:49.861 --> 53:52.030
- We have to go right now.
- Wha... why?

53:52.072 --> 53:54.992
- Wait a minute.
- The guy I told you about is here.

53:55.033 --> 53:56.535
Harvard Hottie?

53:56.577 --> 53:59.246
- Mmm.
- Which one? Which one, where?

53:59.288 --> 54:02.958
Yankees cap, blue shirt,
blue blood.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.377
Mmm.
He is gorgeous.

54:05.419 --> 54:06.712
Yeah, okay, let's go.

54:06.753 --> 54:08.547
No no no, are you out of your mind?
You kidding me?

54:08.589 --> 54:10.424
No, I'm out of
my league, okay?

54:10.465 --> 54:11.842
Let's go.

54:11.884 --> 54:13.719
Oops.

54:15.721 --> 54:17.306
What the hell
are you doing?

54:17.347 --> 54:20.392
Oh my God, I know that girl.
Annie!

54:20.434 --> 54:22.436
Annie!

54:22.477 --> 54:24.104
Come on, have a drink
with him already.

54:24.146 --> 54:26.440
I told you, I can't
date on the job.

54:26.481 --> 54:28.817
Are you gonna use this job as an excuse
for everything or what?

54:28.859 --> 54:29.943
Say hello
to the nice fella.

54:29.985 --> 54:32.154
- Hey.
- Guys, this is Annie.

54:32.195 --> 54:33.780
I don't know your name.
I'm sorry.

54:33.822 --> 54:35.949
- Oh, Lynette.
- Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

54:35.991 --> 54:38.702
Some buddies from high school...
this is Carter, Jojo,

54:38.702 --> 54:41.663
- John, Kenny, Reggie.
- Hello.

54:41.705 --> 54:43.373
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit, grab a chair.

54:43.415 --> 54:45.626
- Oh no, we can't.
- We'd love to.

54:46.627 --> 54:48.712
Yeah.

54:50.047 --> 54:54.051
So, girls, tell us,
how do you know our boy here?

54:54.051 --> 54:58.180
Oh, I really don't know him.
He's Annie's friend.

54:59.848 --> 55:02.809
I know him from work.

55:02.851 --> 55:06.146
Oh yeah?
What kind of work do you do?

55:06.188 --> 55:08.982
Model?

55:09.024 --> 55:12.027
- Stewardess?
- Escort?

55:13.445 --> 55:15.697
She works for someone
in my building.

55:15.739 --> 55:17.574
Oh.

55:17.574 --> 55:18.992
Actually, I'm a nanny.

55:19.034 --> 55:21.787
A nanny?

55:21.828 --> 55:23.830
Dude!

55:23.872 --> 55:26.250
You didn't tell us
you knew a nanny.

55:26.291 --> 55:28.585
That is so porno.

55:28.627 --> 55:30.337
- Are the moms hot?
- Guys.

55:30.379 --> 55:33.465
- Are you hot for the dads?
- Are the dads hot for you?

55:33.507 --> 55:36.051
- Hey, come on.
- You want to know about the dads?

55:36.093 --> 55:38.762
I'll tell you about
the dads.

55:38.804 --> 55:40.931
They're chubby, bald,
steak-eating,

55:40.931 --> 55:42.808
cigar-smoking,
type-A pigs

55:42.849 --> 55:46.311
who get more turned on by the Bloomberg
Wire than they do by any hot nannies.

55:46.311 --> 55:50.107
Actually, it's all of you
in about five years.

55:50.148 --> 55:52.109
Enjoy tonight,

55:52.150 --> 55:55.070
because your future looks
pretty fucking bleak.

55:55.112 --> 55:56.738
- Wait.
- God!

56:00.617 --> 56:03.287
Stupid stupid.

56:06.832 --> 56:09.459
You have two new messages.

56:09.501 --> 56:11.712
Hey, Annie, it's me,

56:11.753 --> 56:14.464
the... the big jerk
from the bar.

56:14.506 --> 56:15.966
- What?
- Listen...

56:16.008 --> 56:17.885
in case you're wondering,
your friend Lynette

56:17.926 --> 56:19.595
- gave me your home number.
- Ex-friend.

56:19.636 --> 56:21.430
I obviously owe you
a major apology.

56:21.471 --> 56:23.724
Please just don't judge me
by my loser friends.

56:23.765 --> 56:25.392
- Mm-hm.
- They were pretty hammered.

56:25.434 --> 56:27.561
Anyway, I want you to
give me an opportunity

56:27.603 --> 56:29.897
to redeem myself
by taking you out.

56:29.938 --> 56:31.899
And I'm warning you,
I won't take no for an answer.

56:31.940 --> 56:34.735
I know where you live, so I'll camp out
at your door if I have to.

56:34.776 --> 56:36.653
You really might as well
just get this over with.

56:36.653 --> 56:38.322
And if you really hate me
after that...

56:38.322 --> 56:40.324
I'll... I'll never
ask you again.

56:40.324 --> 56:43.118
Okay, I'm sorry to ramble.
If I don't hear from you,

56:43.160 --> 56:45.203
I'll ride the elevator
till I find you.

56:45.245 --> 56:46.455
Bye.

56:48.665 --> 56:50.667
I am so screwed.

56:51.919 --> 56:53.837
Annie, it's your mother.

56:53.879 --> 56:57.132
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't
call last night, okay?

56:57.174 --> 56:59.593
I had a really late night.
But about tonight...

56:59.635 --> 57:02.930
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to hear it. I'm coming.

57:02.971 --> 57:04.806
- I am coming.
- All right, fine.

57:04.848 --> 57:06.683
Fine... okay, let me...

57:06.725 --> 57:08.644
let me just call you
after this play date, okay?

57:08.685 --> 57:10.687
Play date?
What the hell is a play date?

57:10.729 --> 57:14.733
- Oh shit.
- You said a curse!

57:14.775 --> 57:18.195
Um, you know, Mom.
A play date...

57:18.195 --> 57:21.782
it's the meeting of
preliminary investment schedules.

57:21.823 --> 57:24.493
Look, I'll call you
later, okay?

57:24.534 --> 57:27.621
All right. Bye.

57:29.998 --> 57:32.042
Who lives here?

57:32.084 --> 57:34.294
Some kid named Jefferson.

57:34.336 --> 57:37.047
Your mom found him
with the Park Avenue play-date service.

57:37.089 --> 57:38.882
Hi, y'all.

57:38.966 --> 57:41.969
I'm Jefferson's
mama Tanya.

57:42.010 --> 57:43.345
Come on in.

57:43.387 --> 57:46.098
We're baking a cake.

57:46.139 --> 57:47.891
Oh my God.

57:47.933 --> 57:50.602
Come on, y'all!

57:50.644 --> 57:52.854
I pretend to be
Jefferson's nanny.

57:52.896 --> 57:56.066
But I was really hired
to watch her.

57:56.108 --> 57:58.235
Yoo-hooo!

57:58.277 --> 58:00.988
And this is what she's
like after Betty Ford.

58:01.029 --> 58:03.740
- Oh!
- Doesn't her husband care?

58:03.782 --> 58:07.327
- Whoo!
- He's 75. She's an ex-showgirl.

58:07.369 --> 58:10.747
He's not complaining
about anything.

58:10.789 --> 58:12.291
Frosting fun!
Yay!

58:14.251 --> 58:17.671
I want to come here every day.

58:19.381 --> 58:21.258
Hey.

58:23.886 --> 58:25.387
What are you doing here?

58:27.431 --> 58:29.516
And what is all over you?

58:29.558 --> 58:33.353
Annie, will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

58:33.395 --> 58:36.064
All right, listen up, people.
This is my apartment.

58:36.106 --> 58:38.901
And my roommate Lisa
is away

58:38.942 --> 58:40.903
on... on business.

58:40.944 --> 58:44.114
You are... oh,
just visiting.

58:44.156 --> 58:46.450
- He is...
- Lynette's new boyfriend.

58:46.491 --> 58:48.118
- Fine.
- I love your friends.

58:48.160 --> 58:49.912
What twisted game
are we playing here?

58:49.953 --> 58:52.247
We're playing the
my-mom-is-coming-over-

58:52.289 --> 58:54.458
and-if-she-finds-out-I'm-a-nanny-
then-I'm-screwed game.

58:54.499 --> 58:57.169
I love it. Hey, should I whip up
a fondue for Mom?

58:57.211 --> 58:59.338
Um, well, you know what?
If you're gonna play it straight,

58:59.379 --> 59:01.089
I would make it meatloaf.
I'm gonna borrow this.

59:01.131 --> 59:03.258
That's my dress.
You can't borrow that dress.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.135
It's a terrible dress.

59:05.177 --> 59:07.346
Fondue?
Go get my dress.

59:08.931 --> 59:12.184
Oh boy, Calvin.
Thank you so much. That looks delicious.

59:12.226 --> 59:16.271
It's so festively
presented too.

59:17.981 --> 59:22.736
So, how did you
and Lynette meet?

59:23.904 --> 59:27.699
Annie's roommate Lisa
introduced us.

59:27.741 --> 59:30.369
It's a shame
she's not here.

59:30.410 --> 59:32.829
I used to
date her too.

59:32.871 --> 59:35.415
Really?

59:35.457 --> 59:38.335
So...

59:38.377 --> 59:40.629
don't you just love
Annie's new place?

59:40.671 --> 59:43.090
- Mm-hm.
- We do.

59:43.131 --> 59:45.342
We're here all the time.

59:45.342 --> 59:48.720
Yeah, I think it's very...
very interesting.

59:48.762 --> 59:50.764
- It's a little small, but...
- Mmm.

59:50.806 --> 59:53.308
...it's a fine
steppingstone, honey.

59:55.185 --> 59:57.980
It's work.
I'll take that.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.819
Well, certainly
keeping her busy.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.112
- Very busy.
- Mm-hm.

01:00:05.153 --> 01:00:06.822
- Busy bee.
- Relentlessly.

01:00:06.863 --> 01:00:09.366
- Round the clock.
- Hello?

01:00:09.366 --> 01:00:12.327
This isn't a brontosaurus.
You don't know anything.

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:15.664
Oh, Grayer!
Please!

01:00:15.706 --> 01:00:18.709
It is yoga hour
and Mommy's on the phone.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:19.835
Hello?

01:00:19.918 --> 01:00:21.837
Yes, hi.
It's me.

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:24.089
l... I know that I agreed
to let you

01:00:24.131 --> 01:00:26.341
visit your grandmother in
the hospital tonight,

01:00:26.383 --> 01:00:29.678
but I feel I need to remind you
that tomorrow is Grayer's birthday.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.681
What? How can that be?
His party isn't until next month.

01:00:32.723 --> 01:00:34.558
Well, we scheduled it
that way on purpose

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.102
because the party planner
I wanted wasn't available.

01:00:37.144 --> 01:00:39.771
Neither was my husband.
But as it turns out,

01:00:39.813 --> 01:00:42.232
Mr. X is coming home
for two days from Chicago,

01:00:42.232 --> 01:00:45.152
so we're planning a small
family celebration.

01:00:45.193 --> 01:00:47.863
Oh that's lovely.
Grayer couldn't ask for a better gift.

01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:50.657
And then afterwards,
we'll all head over to the Carlyle

01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:52.784
for a more formal
affair with friends.

01:00:52.826 --> 01:00:55.120
Obviously, I do expect
you to attend.

01:00:55.162 --> 01:00:56.705
Okay, all right.

01:00:56.747 --> 01:00:58.332
So you will need to dress
appropriately.

01:00:58.373 --> 01:00:59.708
- Right.
- Anyway...

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.919
since you are not
around to help,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.712
- I've taken care of everything.
- Mommy, play!

01:01:03.754 --> 01:01:05.547
Thank you.

01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:09.009
Also, some roses
arrived for you.

01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:11.553
- Roses?
- Yes, very curious.

01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:14.473
The card says,
"Accept my apology,

01:01:14.514 --> 01:01:16.558
or else."

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.352
Oh, that's crazy Grandpa.

01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:20.437
He...

01:01:20.479 --> 01:01:22.606
he didn't visit
Grandma last night

01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:24.191
and we just
let him have it.

01:01:24.233 --> 01:01:26.652
Well, you know how Grayer
is around pollen.

01:01:26.652 --> 01:01:28.612
So, I'll have to
throw them out.

01:01:28.654 --> 01:01:29.947
Annie?
- Oh, okay.

01:01:29.988 --> 01:01:33.575
Well, you know,
I am going to...

01:01:33.617 --> 01:01:35.494
hang up because
the pacemaker isn't on.

01:01:35.535 --> 01:01:37.204
So I'll see you
in the morning.

01:01:37.246 --> 01:01:39.957
Oh gosh.

01:01:39.998 --> 01:01:41.458
- Honey?
- Yeah?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.502
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:43.502 --> 01:01:45.295
Perfect.

01:01:45.337 --> 01:01:46.630
Dessert?

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:03.772
This is of vital importance,
are you aware of that?

01:02:03.814 --> 01:02:05.274
I don't think right now
is the time.

01:02:05.315 --> 01:02:08.277
You have absolutely no idea
how disappointed I am.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.445
Clowns are supposed to be funny.

01:02:10.487 --> 01:02:14.324
Well, they're
French clowns, Grove.

01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:17.327
I hate them and
I hate my birthday.

01:02:17.369 --> 01:02:18.870
...in order to clean up your mess!

01:02:18.912 --> 01:02:21.373
Do not interrupt me.

01:02:21.415 --> 01:02:25.002
Now you told me
that the extra year of preschool

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:27.045
would guarantee him
a spot.

01:02:27.087 --> 01:02:29.756
Today he's six.
What's your plan now?

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:34.344
I'll be back, okay?

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:35.929
We should try to be calm.

01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:37.890
My brother's kids got in.

01:02:37.931 --> 01:02:40.893
...that isn't enough of a humiliation.
I will not tolerate

01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:43.186
- at this point...
- There are mimes in the next room.

01:02:43.228 --> 01:02:45.188
- I suggest you keep your voice down.
- You know what?

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:46.899
Hey.

01:02:49.693 --> 01:02:51.653
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:02:51.695 --> 01:02:53.822
I want to know why
you threw my flowers away.

01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:55.490
I found them
in the stairwell.

01:02:55.532 --> 01:02:58.160
I didn't throw them away, okay?
My lunatic employer did.

01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:00.913
And if you don't get out of here right
now, she's gonna throw me out too.

01:03:00.954 --> 01:03:02.623
- Okay?
- Not until you agree to see me.

01:03:02.664 --> 01:03:04.333
What?
This has got to stop.

01:03:04.374 --> 01:03:06.001
Come on, one date.
That's all I'm asking here.

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:09.796
Oh, fine fine, okay?
After work on Thursday. Go go.

01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:21.099
Nanny.

01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:23.143
Before we head over
to the Carlyle,

01:03:23.185 --> 01:03:26.104
I would like you to know
why Mr. X is so upset.

01:03:27.522 --> 01:03:32.402
It seems that Grayer was
rejected for admission to Collegiate.

01:03:32.402 --> 01:03:34.738
Um...
I'm very sorry.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.698
- That must be upsetting.
- Not upsetting.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.742
Unacceptable.

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:40.744
Stop it!

01:03:42.204 --> 01:03:43.956
Get away from me!
- Oh, sweetheart.

01:03:43.997 --> 01:03:46.416
Don't be afraid.
They're only clowns.

01:03:46.416 --> 01:03:48.252
- I hate them.
- They're nice French clowns.

01:03:48.252 --> 01:03:51.171
They scare me!

01:03:51.213 --> 01:03:53.799
Grayer, go to your mommy.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.217
- Huh-uh.
- Go to your mommy, Grayer.

01:03:55.259 --> 01:03:56.552
- Go.
- No.

01:03:56.593 --> 01:03:58.554
Go on, sweetheart.

01:03:58.595 --> 01:04:00.556
As I was saying, Nanny,

01:04:00.597 --> 01:04:03.308
we feel that you are not
spending enough time

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:05.561
on educational activities
with our son.

01:04:05.602 --> 01:04:08.480
Therefore we have decided
to hire a consultant

01:04:08.522 --> 01:04:10.607
to fully research
the situation.

01:04:10.649 --> 01:04:13.402
He will demand extra
time from you this week...

01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:15.112
Whatever's best for Grayer.

01:04:15.153 --> 01:04:18.448
...starting Thursday evening.

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.368
Do you read to the child
from "The Wall Street Journal"?

01:04:21.451 --> 01:04:24.413
"Financial Times"?
"Granta"?

01:04:27.624 --> 01:04:30.085
l... I sing to him
in French.

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:33.505
Well, we need more time
than I thought

01:04:33.547 --> 01:04:35.424
to get to
the bottom of this.

01:04:43.473 --> 01:04:45.851
I know.
I know, I'm very very late.

01:04:45.893 --> 01:04:47.644
I'm sorry.
Did you get my message?

01:04:47.686 --> 01:04:50.272
- Yep. All six of 'em.
- I couldn't get out of work.

01:04:50.314 --> 01:04:52.816
The consultant kept me forever.
It was horrible.

01:04:52.816 --> 01:04:54.651
Yeah, well, not only
did I lose the reservation,

01:04:54.693 --> 01:04:56.820
but the kitchen
is now closed. So...

01:04:56.862 --> 01:05:00.240
Okay.
I'm sorry I was late.

01:05:00.282 --> 01:05:03.577
Um... sometimes
these things just...

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:05.120
don't work out, okay?

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:08.415
Wait, whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa.

01:05:08.457 --> 01:05:10.709
Think you can just get
rid of me that easily?

01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:12.586
No, it's not about
getting rid of you.

01:05:12.628 --> 01:05:16.089
It's just that no place around here
stays open this late. That's all.

01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:20.385
Actually, I know
the perfect place.

01:05:24.848 --> 01:05:27.392
Pretty good, huh?

01:05:27.434 --> 01:05:30.562
Number one slice
on the Upper East Side.

01:05:30.604 --> 01:05:33.190
It's not bad.

01:05:33.232 --> 01:05:36.693
I'll tell you what though...
it doesn't touch the Jersey Shore.

01:05:38.862 --> 01:05:40.989
Well, if you're such
a pizza connoisseur,

01:05:41.031 --> 01:05:43.283
there's a really great
place in Italian Harlem.

01:05:43.325 --> 01:05:44.618
I'll take you there
sometime.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.286
Harlem?

01:05:46.328 --> 01:05:48.705
I have a hard time
imagining you in Harlem.

01:05:48.705 --> 01:05:51.917
Why? I enjoy
exploring my city.

01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:53.752
Something you should
probably do more of.

01:05:53.794 --> 01:05:55.671
Oh, thank you.

01:05:55.712 --> 01:05:58.966
I'll try to squeeze that in between
cleaning up Grayer's vomit

01:05:59.007 --> 01:06:00.717
and picking up
Mrs. X's laundry.

01:06:00.759 --> 01:06:03.470
Come on, if your job is that bad,
why don't you just quit?

01:06:03.512 --> 01:06:05.806
I mean, it's not like you're on
a career path here.

01:06:05.847 --> 01:06:07.057
I don't understand.

01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:08.725
No, of course
you don't understand.

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:11.395
You've obviously lived
a very charmed life

01:06:11.436 --> 01:06:14.189
growing up on Fifth Avenue.
You went to Harvard.

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.149
A charmed life?

01:06:18.277 --> 01:06:21.238
Okay. Now I get it.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.700
You know, for your
information

01:06:24.741 --> 01:06:26.577
my mother died
when I was four.

01:06:26.577 --> 01:06:29.580
My father traveled
constantly for work.

01:06:29.621 --> 01:06:31.915
I was raised by
nine different nannies

01:06:31.915 --> 01:06:34.418
until I was old enough
to get shipped off to boarding school.

01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:36.879
That's how charmed
my life was.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.552
- I'm really sorry.
- But you know something?

01:06:43.594 --> 01:06:45.762
I still think I turned out
to be a pretty decent guy

01:06:45.804 --> 01:06:47.139
in spite of it all.

01:06:49.224 --> 01:06:51.727
I guess I'm officially
an asshole.

01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:55.480
Well...

01:06:55.522 --> 01:06:57.733
asshole is a pretty
strong word.

01:06:57.774 --> 01:07:01.069
I would have gone
with jerk or bonehead.

01:07:01.111 --> 01:07:04.281
But that's just
my prep school upbringing.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:09.286
I don't know, you know,
I just... I would love to quit.

01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:12.623
I really would, but l...

01:07:12.664 --> 01:07:15.125
I can't leave Grayer.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:17.044
I can't.

01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:19.796
You're gonna think
I'm totally crazy,

01:07:19.838 --> 01:07:23.008
but I feel really bad
for her also.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.302
Do you think I'm crazy?

01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:28.138
Well, you know, you could
be suffering from

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.765
Stockholm Syndrome.

01:07:29.806 --> 01:07:32.267
- You ever heard of Patty Hearst?
- Are you kidding?

01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:33.936
Yes.

01:07:34.019 --> 01:07:36.355
But I do think you should probably
let me kiss you right about now.

01:07:36.396 --> 01:07:38.398
What?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.817
Well...

01:07:40.859 --> 01:07:42.569
we're two blocks
from your building.

01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:45.322
And once we get any closer,
I won't be able to go near you.

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:47.199
Which, to tell you
the truth,

01:07:47.241 --> 01:07:49.201
is all I've really thought
about since that day

01:07:49.201 --> 01:07:51.203
I saw you in that
Betsy Ross getup.

01:07:51.245 --> 01:07:53.789
That is really kinky and weird.

01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:56.416
You don't know
the half of it.

01:08:05.676 --> 01:08:07.928
Good night.

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:09.179
Good night.

01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:11.682
- Pleasant evening.
- Yeah.

01:08:23.652 --> 01:08:25.529
Good night.

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:27.197
Uh-huh.

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.212
Look out for the...

01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:44.339
Sorry.

01:08:59.854 --> 01:09:01.523
While doing field work,

01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:04.401
anthropologists have been
known to lose themselves

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.403
in the very society
that they're studying,

01:09:06.444 --> 01:09:09.907
a phenomenon known
as "going native."

01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:11.742
When this occurs,

01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:15.287
the proper course of action
is to remove oneself

01:09:15.328 --> 01:09:17.122
ASAP.

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:22.044
After my night
with Harvard Hottie,

01:09:22.085 --> 01:09:23.629
it became quite obvious

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:27.716
that my obsession with
the Xs meant I'd gone native.

01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:29.843
Daydreaming in
the park that day,

01:09:29.885 --> 01:09:33.013
I came to the conclusion that
the only right thing to do

01:09:33.055 --> 01:09:35.474
was confront Mrs. X...

01:09:35.515 --> 01:09:37.184
and quit.

01:09:39.435 --> 01:09:41.395
Oh, I forgot about this.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.857
Wow.
This could work.

01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:48.904
Mmm.

01:09:48.946 --> 01:09:51.406
See if you can find me
something short.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.575
It'll go better
with this neckline.

01:09:53.658 --> 01:09:55.118
Okay.

01:09:58.455 --> 01:10:00.541
Oh.

01:10:00.582 --> 01:10:03.252
Did Grayer
get you this?

01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:07.714
God.

01:10:07.756 --> 01:10:11.134
I bought this for
my mother when I was 10.

01:10:11.134 --> 01:10:15.514
She got mad at me, refused to wear it.
She said it was common.

01:10:15.556 --> 01:10:19.059
I think I saved it
out of spite.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.784
How about this?

01:10:37.327 --> 01:10:40.873
Mr. X bought it for me for our first
wedding anniversary.

01:10:40.914 --> 01:10:43.500
So it's only fitting
that I should wear it tonight,

01:10:43.542 --> 01:10:44.626
right?

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:46.879
Definitely.

01:10:57.347 --> 01:11:00.309
Mrs. X, I need to
talk to you about something.

01:11:01.685 --> 01:11:03.604
I know you're really
busy tonight,

01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:05.731
so I was wondering if we
could schedule some time

01:11:05.772 --> 01:11:08.483
- tomorrow night to talk.
- What is it, Nanny?

01:11:10.736 --> 01:11:13.405
l... I think it's better
if we talk alone.

01:11:13.447 --> 01:11:15.699
What is it?

01:11:17.367 --> 01:11:19.620
Nanny, lend a hand.

01:11:37.012 --> 01:11:39.514
Well?

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.516
You look amazing.

01:11:43.227 --> 01:11:45.520
- Really?
- You look very pretty, Mommy.

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:48.148
And... and you like
the Dior?

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:51.151
I mean, I know
it's a little much for dinner,

01:11:51.235 --> 01:11:52.569
but afterwards
he's taking me

01:11:52.611 --> 01:11:55.155
to the President's
Circle Gala at the Met.

01:11:55.197 --> 01:11:56.865
Well, I couldn't imagine
a more perfect dress

01:11:56.907 --> 01:11:58.533
for a romantic
anniversary.

01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:00.953
All I need now
is my husband.

01:12:02.329 --> 01:12:04.998
I just called
the airport.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.252
There wasn't a single
delay or cancelation out of Chicago

01:12:08.252 --> 01:12:10.379
so...

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.673
Where can
that man be?

01:12:14.299 --> 01:12:16.635
Nanny,
call La Grande Nuit

01:12:16.677 --> 01:12:18.262
- and tell them we're running late.
- Come on.

01:12:18.303 --> 01:12:19.888
I don't want to
lose the reservation.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.516
Is it "Le Grande Nuit"
or "La Grande..."

01:12:22.558 --> 01:12:24.643
"Le... Les"?

01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:26.144
I think it's "La."

01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:29.898
Thanks, smarty-pants.

01:12:32.651 --> 01:12:35.195
- Hello?
Uh yeah, it's me.

01:12:35.237 --> 01:12:37.114
Listen, I'm losing
cell service here.

01:12:37.155 --> 01:12:39.366
I need you to find
my wife and explain to her

01:12:39.408 --> 01:12:41.243
that my flight
was canceled.

01:12:41.285 --> 01:12:44.246
Uh, and since I'm gonna have to be back
here Sunday night,

01:12:44.329 --> 01:12:46.164
I'm just gonna spend
the whole weekend in Chicago.

01:12:46.206 --> 01:12:48.709
- No no no...
- Make sure to tell her I'm sorry.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.711
No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this.
Look, she...

01:12:56.592 --> 01:12:59.386
Nanny, who was it?

01:13:06.184 --> 01:13:07.853
What did he say?

01:13:09.438 --> 01:13:11.356
Um...

01:13:13.025 --> 01:13:15.569
he said that...

01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:17.112
his flight was canceled.

01:13:19.156 --> 01:13:22.284
And...

01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:25.537
and he's very
very sorry.

01:13:32.044 --> 01:13:34.504
Make sure you
put that one on top.

01:13:34.504 --> 01:13:35.631
I don't want
anything to wrinkle.

01:13:38.133 --> 01:13:39.509
Mommy,
where are you going?

01:13:42.346 --> 01:13:43.889
Mommy, don't go!

01:13:43.931 --> 01:13:47.267
No, Gray... no, Grayer.
Don't... don't be difficult.

01:13:47.309 --> 01:13:50.020
Mommy has to go away for
a few days to get some rest.

01:13:50.062 --> 01:13:53.190
Nanny, I've decided to
take a few days off.

01:13:53.232 --> 01:13:56.193
I'll be at the spa
at Canyon Ranch in Lenox.

01:13:56.235 --> 01:13:59.404
- Maria has all my numbers.
- Oh God.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.743
Nanny, can we go upstairs?

01:14:04.785 --> 01:14:07.829
I feel funny.

01:14:07.871 --> 01:14:11.416
Oh my God!
How did this come on so fast? 104?

01:14:14.545 --> 01:14:16.547
Oh my God, oh my God.
Okay okay.

01:14:16.588 --> 01:14:18.549
Honey, come here.
You okay?

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:19.883
I'm so sorry.

01:14:19.925 --> 01:14:22.511
That's okay, that's okay.
All right.

01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:26.181
Okay, wait.
No.

01:14:26.223 --> 01:14:28.308
Hey, Lynette, it's Annie.
Listen, I need your help.

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.227
Grayer has
a temperature of 104

01:14:30.269 --> 01:14:32.604
and I have vomit all over me
and there's nobody here.

01:14:32.646 --> 01:14:34.106
God. Did you
call his mother?

01:14:34.147 --> 01:14:36.400
Yes, I called his mother.
She's at some friggin' spa.

01:14:36.441 --> 01:14:38.485
I left three messages
and she won't call me back.

01:14:38.527 --> 01:14:40.362
I don't know what to do.

01:14:40.404 --> 01:14:42.364
I mean, should I take him to
the emergency room or something?

01:14:42.406 --> 01:14:44.449
- Annie, I can't answer that.
- I...

01:14:44.491 --> 01:14:47.202
Do you know a number of a doctor

01:14:47.244 --> 01:14:49.705
I could call for advice,
or a nurse even?

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:51.039
Of course I know a nurse.

01:14:51.081 --> 01:14:52.958
Your mother.

01:14:55.085 --> 01:14:56.879
Nanny?

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.006
Lynette, I have to
call you back.

01:14:59.047 --> 01:15:01.383
What is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong?

01:15:05.012 --> 01:15:07.973
I want my mommy.

01:15:10.309 --> 01:15:12.269
Me too.

01:15:15.981 --> 01:15:17.983
How is everything?

01:15:18.025 --> 01:15:20.444
His fever's down.

01:15:20.444 --> 01:15:22.738
But I think he's
got the croup.

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:25.449
The steam should help
open his passages

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:29.411
and hopefully it'll ease up his cough
and he can get some rest.

01:15:29.453 --> 01:15:31.622
Is... is there anything
I can do?

01:15:31.622 --> 01:15:34.333
Just close the door.

01:15:45.135 --> 01:15:46.595
He's okay now.

01:15:46.637 --> 01:15:48.263
Much better.

01:15:48.305 --> 01:15:49.765
Oh, thank you, God.

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:52.267
Even so, you should bring him
to the doctor in the morning.

01:15:52.309 --> 01:15:54.519
He's probably gonna
need a prescription.

01:15:54.561 --> 01:15:55.812
Okay.

01:15:55.854 --> 01:15:58.148
Hey, Ma, um...

01:15:59.733 --> 01:16:02.194
l... I don't know
how to...

01:16:02.236 --> 01:16:04.655
thank you for
coming here, and helping...

01:16:04.696 --> 01:16:06.615
Why'd you lie
to me, Annie?

01:16:10.327 --> 01:16:12.663
I have never lied to you.

01:16:12.704 --> 01:16:14.248
Ever.

01:16:14.289 --> 01:16:15.541
I know.

01:16:15.582 --> 01:16:18.835
I just...

01:16:20.796 --> 01:16:23.465
Oh, Mom, I couldn't
handle it anymore.

01:16:23.507 --> 01:16:24.925
- I just couldn't handle it.
- What?

01:16:24.967 --> 01:16:27.469
What couldn't you handle?
You're young, you're smart,

01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:31.181
you're energetic. You got this
incredibly bright future ahead of you.

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:32.683
It was too bright, Ma.
All right?

01:16:32.683 --> 01:16:35.102
I just... I just, I got...
I had to get away.

01:16:35.143 --> 01:16:37.104
And do this?

01:16:37.145 --> 01:16:39.523
You understand?
Every night shift I worked,

01:16:39.565 --> 01:16:42.150
every overtime hour
I accepted,

01:16:42.192 --> 01:16:45.153
I did it because I wanted
something better for you than I had.

01:16:46.196 --> 01:16:48.949
Nanny!
Good, you're up.

01:16:48.991 --> 01:16:50.492
Just leave that there.

01:16:50.534 --> 01:16:53.787
So listen, the spa
was just awful,

01:16:53.829 --> 01:16:57.249
totally overrun
with suburban riffraff.

01:16:57.291 --> 01:16:59.293
And then in the middle
of my body scrub,

01:16:59.334 --> 01:17:01.920
Mr. X called
and believe it or not,

01:17:01.962 --> 01:17:04.715
he wants to take us
all to Nantucket next week.

01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:07.843
So I figured I might as well
cut my trip short and...

01:17:09.887 --> 01:17:12.097
Who's this?

01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:13.849
I'm Judy.

01:17:13.891 --> 01:17:16.351
It's my mom.

01:17:17.519 --> 01:17:20.522
You never mentioned
you had a mother, Nanny.

01:17:20.564 --> 01:17:23.317
Um...

01:17:23.358 --> 01:17:26.028
my mom's a nurse.
She came over here to help me.

01:17:26.069 --> 01:17:29.239
Grayer's been very
very very sick.

01:17:29.281 --> 01:17:31.533
- I tried calling you...
- Where is he?

01:17:31.575 --> 01:17:35.037
Well he's...
he's sleeping now.

01:17:35.078 --> 01:17:37.122
Then he can't be
that sick now, can he?

01:17:37.164 --> 01:17:39.499
So listen, could you
quickly unpack my luggage

01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:41.501
and just put everything
in the laundry?

01:17:41.543 --> 01:17:44.546
I'm exhausted and Mr. X is expected
sometime before 9:00.

01:17:44.588 --> 01:17:46.965
I will see you
in the morning.

01:17:47.007 --> 01:17:50.219
Oh, very nice
to meet you, Julie.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.970
Judy.

01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:07.694
Call me when this phase
of your life is over.

01:18:11.365 --> 01:18:14.910
I desperately wanted
to yell out after her,

01:18:14.952 --> 01:18:16.912
but it was like one of
those awful dreams

01:18:16.954 --> 01:18:19.039
where I had no voice.

01:18:19.081 --> 01:18:22.042
My desire to be an observer of life...

01:18:22.084 --> 01:18:24.962
...was actually keeping me
from living one.

01:18:24.962 --> 01:18:28.423
Clearly, the woman's
heinous.

01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:30.634
You gotta quit.
It's just that simple.

01:18:30.676 --> 01:18:33.554
I can't, all right?
I tried.

01:18:33.595 --> 01:18:36.932
What if I made you
a tempting offer?

01:18:36.974 --> 01:18:39.935
I'm gonna go to my father's house in
Southampton for a month.

01:18:39.977 --> 01:18:44.439
I've got to take some time, figure out
if law school is really right for me.

01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:45.857
Why don't you join me?

01:18:45.899 --> 01:18:47.985
Do a little soul-searching.

01:18:48.026 --> 01:18:50.362
We'd get the whole house to ourselves...
won't cost us a cent.

01:18:50.404 --> 01:18:53.615
We'll walk on the beach.
We'll drink red wine,

01:18:53.657 --> 01:18:56.076
grill fresh fish.

01:18:56.118 --> 01:18:59.580
That sounds like heaven.

01:18:59.621 --> 01:19:02.040
But what if this vacation
can save their marriage?

01:19:02.082 --> 01:19:04.251
If I quit now,
I'll ruin it

01:19:04.293 --> 01:19:06.128
and break Grayer's heart.

01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:09.506
What about my heart?
Do I count for anything?

01:19:11.633 --> 01:19:14.511
Come on, say yes.

01:19:14.553 --> 01:19:17.014
Be young with me
in the Hamptons.

01:19:17.014 --> 01:19:19.558
Don't go to Nantucket
with the weirdoes.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.727
What do you say?

01:19:30.527 --> 01:19:33.488
Not a chance in hell,
is there?

01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:36.450
- I can take a hint.
- Come on, I didn't say no.

01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:39.620
You weren't exactly screaming
yes though, were you?

01:19:39.661 --> 01:19:41.663
I'm starting to wonder
if you're really selfless

01:19:41.705 --> 01:19:44.374
or just a little
self-obsessed.

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:46.335
Thank you.
Thanks.

01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:48.795
I have to go.

01:19:51.256 --> 01:19:55.636
Listen, if you change
your mind, my offer stands.

01:20:02.935 --> 01:20:05.354
We're going to 'Tucket.
We're going to 'Tucket.

01:20:05.395 --> 01:20:08.649
Guess what else?
I'm getting a puppy.

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:10.817
Oh!

01:20:10.859 --> 01:20:13.028
Oh my God!

01:20:15.322 --> 01:20:18.075
Daddy, Daddy,
where's my puppy?

01:20:18.116 --> 01:20:21.495
Been waiting for you right up
in the car there, sport.

01:20:21.537 --> 01:20:23.288
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Mmm.

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:25.415
A family trip has been
long overdue.

01:20:25.457 --> 01:20:28.210
Mmm, listen, I didn't
want to say anything in front of Grayer,

01:20:28.252 --> 01:20:30.212
but the truth is,
I can only stay for a few days.

01:20:30.254 --> 01:20:32.923
They're really pushing me to
finish up in Chicago.

01:20:32.965 --> 01:20:35.509
You can't be serious.

01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:37.511
You're not gonna leave us
on this island alone.

01:20:37.553 --> 01:20:39.596
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

01:20:39.638 --> 01:20:42.307
# But I'm moving on #

01:20:42.349 --> 01:20:47.271
# I'm gonna be your
number one #

01:20:47.312 --> 01:20:49.982
# I'm not the kind
of girl #

01:20:50.023 --> 01:20:54.444
# Who gives up
just like that #

01:20:54.444 --> 01:20:56.488
- # Oh no-o-o-o... #
Hi.

01:20:56.530 --> 01:20:59.533
It's Annie.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

01:20:59.575 --> 01:21:02.077
You're probably
in Southampton,

01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:04.079
but I just wanted to
let you know that...

01:21:04.121 --> 01:21:05.956
my cell phone
doesn't work here.

01:21:05.998 --> 01:21:08.792
So if you wanted
to call...

01:21:08.792 --> 01:21:11.169
if you wanted
to call,

01:21:11.211 --> 01:21:13.338
- you probably have the number...
Nanny, hurry up!

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.340
...already on your cell phone,
but I will give it to you

01:21:15.382 --> 01:21:18.218
just in case.
It is 508...

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.470
Hello?
- Oh.

01:21:20.512 --> 01:21:22.639
- What, hello?
- Hello, Nanny?

01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:24.391
- Wha...
- I need to use this phone.

01:21:24.433 --> 01:21:26.852
- Immediately.
- Okay, so sorry.

01:21:26.852 --> 01:21:30.480
- Oh God.
- Nanny, we're going to the beach.

01:21:30.522 --> 01:21:32.900
When I grow up,
I want enough money

01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:35.319
to build a real castle.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.530
Just remember, Grove,
that money can't buy love.

01:21:38.572 --> 01:21:41.575
But Mommy pays you money
and I love you.

01:21:41.617 --> 01:21:44.286
Surprise surprise, dear.

01:21:46.079 --> 01:21:49.958
- Mother?
- My, you've gotten portly.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.461
Hi, Grandma.

01:21:52.502 --> 01:21:54.671
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:21:54.671 --> 01:21:58.425
Ask your wife.
She's the one who requested I come.

01:21:58.467 --> 01:22:02.095
- Darling, l...
- Not that I need an invitation.

01:22:02.137 --> 01:22:04.264
It is my house.

01:22:04.306 --> 01:22:06.767
I just wanted your mother
to be here for the news.

01:22:06.808 --> 01:22:09.436
News, what news?
What in the hell is going on here?

01:22:09.478 --> 01:22:12.898
I'm having another baby.

01:22:15.359 --> 01:22:17.611
...virtually impossible.

01:22:17.653 --> 01:22:19.363
What exactly do you want?

01:22:19.404 --> 01:22:22.199
And now my mother is here
so I can't go to Chicago.

01:22:22.241 --> 01:22:24.493
One lousy week!

01:22:24.535 --> 01:22:27.496
You know something?
You are an infuriating woman.

01:22:27.538 --> 01:22:28.997
You really are!

01:22:29.039 --> 01:22:31.833
That's what you get for
rejecting debutante season.

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.835
Who asked you, bitch?

01:22:44.179 --> 01:22:45.889
Can you look after
the kids for a minute?

01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:48.976
I'm the only nanny here.
I just have to use the restroom.

01:22:49.017 --> 01:22:50.769
Hmm.

01:22:50.811 --> 01:22:53.981
Make it snappy, dear.
I'm on the last chapter.

01:22:54.022 --> 01:22:56.066
Oh, thanks a million.

01:23:09.621 --> 01:23:12.583
Oh.
You look gorgeous.

01:23:14.084 --> 01:23:16.879
Listen, I need some nanny advice.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.589
- Okay.
- To tell you the truth,

01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:21.800
I don't know what's gotten
into her lately.

01:23:21.842 --> 01:23:24.803
Well, I installed
a Nanny Cam.

01:23:24.845 --> 01:23:26.889
So we'll soon see
the truth.

01:23:26.972 --> 01:23:29.766
It might be time
to let her go.

01:23:33.312 --> 01:23:35.772
I saw another one.

01:23:35.814 --> 01:23:37.816
Make a wish, Grove.

01:23:37.858 --> 01:23:41.778
I wish we could stay
in 'Tucket forever,

01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:45.199
Mommy, Daddy, you
and my puppy.

01:23:52.164 --> 01:23:54.166
Grove?

01:23:58.921 --> 01:24:02.049
You know I...

01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:05.302
I'm not gonna be
your nanny forever.

01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:08.472
I can't be.

01:24:08.472 --> 01:24:11.934
That doesn't mean I'm not
gonna always be your friend.

01:24:35.874 --> 01:24:38.794
What, there's no OJ
in the goddamned shit-shack?

01:24:38.835 --> 01:24:41.713
Oh, I was just
about to make some.

01:24:41.755 --> 01:24:43.465
Mm-hm.

01:24:52.683 --> 01:24:55.561
Where's Grayer?
Isn't he up yet?

01:24:55.602 --> 01:24:58.814
Um, he had a little
trouble sleeping.

01:24:58.855 --> 01:25:00.691
So...

01:25:04.695 --> 01:25:08.031
Concentrate? You have
got to be kidding me.

01:25:08.073 --> 01:25:11.285
All my money and I can't
get fresh-squeezed? Come on.

01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:16.373
Uh, we used it all
at the party, so...

01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:18.166
Hmm.

01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:21.670
Well then, why don't you and I
take a little trip to the market

01:25:21.712 --> 01:25:23.547
and get us some, huh?

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:49.615
I'm not in right now.
Leave it at the beep.

01:25:49.656 --> 01:25:53.202
# Be the new one,
burn to shine #

01:25:53.243 --> 01:25:57.664
# I take the blue ones
every time #

01:25:57.706 --> 01:26:01.835
# Walk me down
your broken line #

01:26:01.877 --> 01:26:04.504
# All you have to do
is cry #

01:26:04.546 --> 01:26:07.549
# Yes, all you
have to do is cry #

01:26:09.134 --> 01:26:12.012
# All you have to do
is cry. #

01:26:24.775 --> 01:26:27.110
- Where's Grayer?
- With his grandmother.

01:26:28.946 --> 01:26:31.573
And where, may I ask,
have you been?

01:26:34.993 --> 01:26:36.954
Um...

01:26:36.954 --> 01:26:39.498
- I just had to clear my head.
- Did you?

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.668
I imagine your
unacceptable behavior

01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:46.255
has something to do
with that boy in the building.

01:26:46.296 --> 01:26:49.091
Nanny.

01:26:49.132 --> 01:26:52.135
I wasn't
born yesterday.

01:26:52.177 --> 01:26:54.513
He called several
times this week.

01:26:54.555 --> 01:26:57.057
He called?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:59.059
I suppose I forgot.

01:27:02.145 --> 01:27:04.648
It's really for
your own good.

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.276
He's a little out of
your league, don't you think?

01:27:07.317 --> 01:27:09.945
It couldn't possibly
end well.

01:27:11.446 --> 01:27:14.408
Clearly this
isn't working out.

01:27:14.449 --> 01:27:16.785
Mr. X has arranged for
a taxi to take you to the ferry

01:27:16.827 --> 01:27:18.745
and then for a car to
pick you up on the other end.

01:27:18.787 --> 01:27:20.789
Please don't...
please don't do this.

01:27:20.831 --> 01:27:23.876
Not... not for me,
but for Grayer.

01:27:23.917 --> 01:27:27.212
Not until you and your husband work
your problems out.

01:27:27.254 --> 01:27:29.590
Don't you dare.

01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:32.384
You stupid...
you stupid girl.

01:27:32.426 --> 01:27:35.387
As if you know anything
about my life.

01:27:35.429 --> 01:27:38.181
As if you know anything
about the real world.

01:27:59.912 --> 01:28:01.205
All I got's $100.

01:28:01.246 --> 01:28:03.749
All right, you know what?
Just give me the change

01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:06.001
when you come back for my mother
at some point, okay?

01:28:06.043 --> 01:28:07.711
Keep 10 bucks
for yourself, all right?

01:28:07.753 --> 01:28:10.422
Nanny...

01:28:10.464 --> 01:28:12.674
here's your final payment.

01:28:12.716 --> 01:28:14.551
I expect you to
have all your things

01:28:14.551 --> 01:28:16.553
out of our apartment by
the time we come back.

01:28:16.553 --> 01:28:19.056
Just leave the keys
with the doorman.

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:29.483
Grayer, I think you
should take a nap.

01:28:29.524 --> 01:28:32.027
I'm certainly ready
for one.

01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:35.197
Nanny!
Where are you going?

01:28:36.865 --> 01:28:39.535
- Nanny!
- Grayer. Grayer.

01:28:39.576 --> 01:28:40.994
- Nanny!
- Stay here.

01:28:41.036 --> 01:28:42.913
- Here.
- What are you doing?

01:28:42.955 --> 01:28:44.581
- Take it, take it.
- What?

01:28:44.581 --> 01:28:47.417
I can't tolerate the yapping.
Grayer's too young anyway.

01:28:48.585 --> 01:28:50.337
- Nanny!
- Grayer.

01:28:50.379 --> 01:28:52.464
- Nanny, don't go!
- Grayer, sweetheart...

01:28:52.506 --> 01:28:55.926
Nanny, wait!

01:28:55.968 --> 01:28:58.428
- Nanny!
- Grayer!

01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:00.556
Nanny, don't leave me.

01:29:03.016 --> 01:29:05.227
Nanny!

01:29:11.942 --> 01:29:14.152
Grayer.

01:30:02.034 --> 01:30:03.535
What?

01:30:22.387 --> 01:30:24.223
Go ahead, puppy,
do your business.

01:30:24.264 --> 01:30:26.099
Anywhere you like.

01:30:32.147 --> 01:30:33.815
Good puppy!

01:30:36.026 --> 01:30:39.696
Nanny Cam, Nanny Cam,
where are you hiding?

01:30:46.578 --> 01:30:48.747
I love you.

01:30:51.583 --> 01:30:53.877
Hola.

01:30:55.128 --> 01:30:56.797
Hmm.

01:30:57.798 --> 01:30:59.716
Aha!

01:30:59.758 --> 01:31:02.427
Okay, lady,
you want Nanny Cam?

01:31:02.469 --> 01:31:04.555
I'll give you
"Nannies Gone Wild."

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.936
And this is how the most
significant confrontation

01:31:10.978 --> 01:31:13.355
in my life...

01:31:13.397 --> 01:31:16.024
happened with a teddy bear.

01:31:23.699 --> 01:31:27.911
After the abrupt termination
of my field work,

01:31:27.911 --> 01:31:30.372
I took some time to
make sense

01:31:30.414 --> 01:31:33.584
of all that
I had witnessed.

01:31:33.625 --> 01:31:35.335
During this period

01:31:35.377 --> 01:31:38.046
I read that critics of
anthropology believe

01:31:38.088 --> 01:31:40.299
that just by
observing a culture

01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.467
you inevitably change it.

01:31:42.509 --> 01:31:44.636
- Mm!
- Ow! Hey.

01:31:44.678 --> 01:31:47.472
In the many times that
I thought of Grayer,

01:31:47.514 --> 01:31:50.726
I secretly hoped
those critics...

01:31:50.767 --> 01:31:52.895
were right.

01:31:54.521 --> 01:31:57.941
This is a tape of
my latest nanny disaster.

01:31:58.025 --> 01:32:01.695
She was extremely problematic,
to say the least.

01:32:01.737 --> 01:32:03.530
She neglected Grayer.

01:32:03.572 --> 01:32:06.742
She drank.
She even flirted with my husband.

01:32:06.783 --> 01:32:08.202
I finally had to fire her

01:32:08.243 --> 01:32:10.913
for promiscuous behavior
with a boy in the building.

01:32:10.954 --> 01:32:13.957
This videotape shows her
feeding my child

01:32:13.957 --> 01:32:17.711
peanut butter and jelly
directly from the jar.

01:32:17.753 --> 01:32:19.546
You know, I remember
this nanny.

01:32:19.588 --> 01:32:22.299
She had a very
peculiar attitude.

01:32:22.341 --> 01:32:24.301
Let's watch.

01:32:24.301 --> 01:32:26.637
You excited about
going to Nantucket?

01:32:26.637 --> 01:32:27.804
Yes.

01:32:27.846 --> 01:32:29.348
Okay, well, why don't you
close your eyes

01:32:29.389 --> 01:32:31.725
and you can dream about
building sand castles?

01:32:31.767 --> 01:32:33.435
- I love you, Nanny.
- Good night.

01:32:33.477 --> 01:32:35.979
This must be the wrong tape.
I've never seen this one before.

01:32:36.021 --> 01:32:38.607
It's all right, just let it play out.
We'll get to something good.

01:32:42.569 --> 01:32:44.780
Oh!
It's a problem.

01:32:44.821 --> 01:32:46.990
Big problem.

01:32:47.032 --> 01:32:50.661
Okay, Mrs. X, now it's time for a few
simple child-care rules.

01:32:50.661 --> 01:32:53.372
Oh, all right. The teddy bear has
been compromised.

01:32:53.413 --> 01:32:56.959
Slamming the door in
your kid's face is not okay.

01:32:57.042 --> 01:33:00.295
Spending more time on a benefit for
kids you've never met

01:33:00.337 --> 01:33:02.798
than you do with
your own blood is not okay.

01:33:02.839 --> 01:33:06.677
Going to a spa when
your son has a fever of 104

01:33:06.677 --> 01:33:08.720
and not answering
emergency calls,

01:33:08.762 --> 01:33:10.556
that officially makes you
an unfit mother.

01:33:10.597 --> 01:33:12.015
This is outrageous.
Stop the tape.

01:33:12.015 --> 01:33:15.894
Uh, no, this is clearly
a disgruntled nanny.

01:33:15.936 --> 01:33:18.730
We... we might have
something to learn here.

01:33:18.772 --> 01:33:22.568
Yeah, I know that you're really busy
with your hair appointments

01:33:22.609 --> 01:33:24.236
and your Watsu
massages

01:33:24.278 --> 01:33:27.281
and your attempts to stay young
so your husband won't leave you,

01:33:27.322 --> 01:33:31.159
but here's an idea... why don't you try
eating dinner with your child

01:33:31.201 --> 01:33:32.786
every once in a blue moon?

01:33:32.828 --> 01:33:34.246
And a head's up here,
lady.

01:33:34.288 --> 01:33:37.124
Try smiling once in a while.
People hate you!

01:33:38.876 --> 01:33:40.669
As for you, Mr. X,

01:33:40.711 --> 01:33:42.880
who the hell are you?

01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:45.090
Maybe you're asking
the same about me.

01:33:45.132 --> 01:33:46.967
I know you've noticed my ass,

01:33:47.009 --> 01:33:48.886
but you probably don't
recognize my face,

01:33:48.886 --> 01:33:50.679
so here's a little hint,
okay?

01:33:50.721 --> 01:33:53.682
I'm the one who's been
raising your son.

01:33:58.437 --> 01:34:00.731
Grayer is not
an accessory.

01:34:00.772 --> 01:34:04.443
His mother didn't
order him from a catalogue.

01:34:04.484 --> 01:34:06.695
Your son, your wife,

01:34:06.737 --> 01:34:09.573
are... are...

01:34:09.615 --> 01:34:11.909
are people in your home,

01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:15.871
human beings who are
drowning in their desire

01:34:15.913 --> 01:34:18.999
for you to just...
for you to look at them.

01:34:32.846 --> 01:34:36.767
You know, the truth is,
I don't wish either of you harm.

01:34:38.602 --> 01:34:41.438
If for no other reason
than you having

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.858
the profound privilege
of being Grayer's parents.

01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:50.531
Grayer loves you.

01:34:52.574 --> 01:34:54.451
He...

01:34:54.493 --> 01:34:58.205
he doesn't care what you're
wearing or what you buy him

01:34:58.247 --> 01:34:59.957
or what school
he gets into.

01:34:59.998 --> 01:35:03.877
He just... he just
wants you there.

01:35:03.919 --> 01:35:06.255
That's it.

01:35:07.839 --> 01:35:10.509
And time's running out,

01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:13.011
and he won't love you
unconditionally that much longer.

01:35:13.053 --> 01:35:16.181
So...

01:35:16.223 --> 01:35:18.934
for your own good,

01:35:18.976 --> 01:35:21.353
don't miss out
on getting to know him.

01:35:21.395 --> 01:35:25.107
He is...
he's truly

01:35:25.148 --> 01:35:29.611
an amazing
amazing little person.

01:35:52.009 --> 01:35:53.594
Excuse me.

01:35:53.635 --> 01:35:56.138
Of course.

01:36:11.361 --> 01:36:13.447
Buenas noches.

01:36:18.911 --> 01:36:22.497
It's a much tougher game
out there for women.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:27.502
Nature deals us
some tricky cards.

01:36:27.544 --> 01:36:29.504
Is that so hard
for you to understand?

01:36:29.546 --> 01:36:31.340
No.

01:36:31.381 --> 01:36:34.134
I don't know, Mom.
I just...

01:36:36.762 --> 01:36:39.223
So I guess you're not
going into finance?

01:36:39.264 --> 01:36:42.017
I don't think that having money
makes it any easier.

01:36:42.059 --> 01:36:44.645
You know,
I know that now.

01:36:47.814 --> 01:36:50.234
It's okay.

01:36:50.275 --> 01:36:52.110
It's your life.

01:36:52.152 --> 01:36:54.196
Personally, I think
you're making a big mistake.

01:36:58.742 --> 01:37:01.787
But it is your life.

01:37:01.828 --> 01:37:04.331
I want you
to be happy.

01:37:09.586 --> 01:37:11.463
Hey.

01:37:11.505 --> 01:37:13.382
- Hayden.
Oh, that's right.

01:37:13.423 --> 01:37:15.551
I forgot to mention
his name is Hayden.

01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:17.636
And once I finally
let myself say it,

01:37:17.678 --> 01:37:19.638
it was a habit that
was pretty hard to break.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.598
It is... it's going
pretty good actually.

01:37:21.598 --> 01:37:23.934
There's more scholarships
out there than I thought.

01:37:23.976 --> 01:37:26.228
So why are you
so late?

01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:29.398
Because I have
something for you.

01:37:29.439 --> 01:37:31.692
It's from
your former employer.

01:37:31.733 --> 01:37:32.776
What?

01:37:32.818 --> 01:37:34.903
She cornered me
on the 12th floor,

01:37:34.945 --> 01:37:38.740
figured I could get
to you before she could.

01:37:41.577 --> 01:37:44.246
I don't want to
read this.

01:37:44.288 --> 01:37:46.874
- Why don't I read it to you?
- Okay.

01:37:52.546 --> 01:37:54.006
"Dear Annie...

01:37:56.341 --> 01:37:59.428
It's been several months
since we've spoken.

01:37:59.469 --> 01:38:02.890
Even so, the things you said
on that tape haunt me every day.

01:38:02.931 --> 01:38:06.643
And now looking back,
I don't know what to say

01:38:06.685 --> 01:38:08.770
except thank you...

01:38:08.812 --> 01:38:11.523
- and I'm sorry."
"And I'm sorry.

01:38:11.565 --> 01:38:13.692
You were so right.

01:38:13.734 --> 01:38:17.696
Of all my privileges,
Grayer is my greatest.

01:38:17.738 --> 01:38:21.200
I desperately needed
someone to show me that.

01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:22.910
You did.

01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:26.205
And for that,
I owe you the world.

01:38:27.623 --> 01:38:29.583
You may or may not
be surprised

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:31.627
to learn that
I've left my husband.

01:38:31.668 --> 01:38:33.712
Not out of the jar.

01:38:33.754 --> 01:38:35.464
Try it.

01:38:36.882 --> 01:38:38.884
Any man who made me
feel desperate enough

01:38:38.926 --> 01:38:41.595
to feign a pregnancy
wasn't worth fighting for.

01:38:41.637 --> 01:38:43.388
Isn't it good?

01:38:45.515 --> 01:38:47.935
Yeah.

01:38:47.976 --> 01:38:49.353
Yeah, it is good.

01:38:49.394 --> 01:38:51.813
So I'm pretty confident
that in time

01:38:51.855 --> 01:38:53.649
we'll be getting
along just fine.

01:38:53.690 --> 01:38:55.484
Yeah, it's really good.

01:38:55.526 --> 01:38:58.153
It's really good.

01:38:58.195 --> 01:39:01.740
Please know that I wish
you all the best in life.

01:39:01.782 --> 01:39:03.909
- Sincerely..."
- "Sincerely...

01:39:03.951 --> 01:39:06.203
Alexandra.

01:39:06.245 --> 01:39:08.288
P. S...

01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:14.378
I'm happy to report that Grayer asks
for you a little bit less

01:39:14.419 --> 01:39:17.673
every day and every night."

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.892
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:39:28.934 --> 01:39:30.185
Let's get out of here.

01:39:30.227 --> 01:39:32.020
Catching the Yankees game
with my dad tonight.

01:39:32.062 --> 01:39:34.314
- Sounds wonderful.
- Yeah.

01:39:34.356 --> 01:39:38.277
There's a popular belief
amongst anthropologists

01:39:38.318 --> 01:39:42.281
that you must immerse
yourself in an unfamiliar world

01:39:42.322 --> 01:39:46.326
in order to truly
understand your own.

01:39:47.536 --> 01:39:50.038
I've probably gotta
get going soon actually.

01:39:52.916 --> 01:39:54.501
See you
later tonight, okay?

01:39:54.543 --> 01:39:56.295
Yeah.

01:39:56.336 --> 01:39:58.505
I certainly hope so.

01:40:03.302 --> 01:40:05.387
In conclusion,

01:40:05.429 --> 01:40:07.639
I hope this field diary
has been illuminating

01:40:07.681 --> 01:40:11.059
for those considering my application
to graduate school.

01:40:12.603 --> 01:40:14.479
It certainly has been
for me.

01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:16.690
# Oh yeah #

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.487
After a lost summer
of being Nanny,

01:40:22.529 --> 01:40:25.199
I finally got to know Annie.

01:40:29.536 --> 01:40:31.830
Thanks to a little man
named Grayer,

01:40:31.872 --> 01:40:34.791
I only had to trek
across the Hudson River

01:40:34.791 --> 01:40:37.794
to make this most
amazing discovery.

01:40:37.794 --> 01:40:39.630
- # I won't let you down #
- # Freedom #

01:40:39.671 --> 01:40:42.132
- # I will not give you up #
- # Freedom #

01:40:42.174 --> 01:40:43.592
# Have some faith
in the sound #

01:40:43.634 --> 01:40:45.552
# You got to give
what you take #

01:40:45.594 --> 01:40:47.095
# Freedom #

01:40:47.137 --> 01:40:49.097
# I won't let you down #

01:40:49.181 --> 01:40:52.017
- # Freedom #
- # So please don't give me up. #

01:40:56.855 --> 01:40:58.899
# Wake up one morning #

01:40:58.982 --> 01:41:01.985
# You realize #

01:41:02.027 --> 01:41:05.072
# Your life is one
big compromise #

01:41:05.113 --> 01:41:06.782
# Compromise #

01:41:06.823 --> 01:41:11.495
# Stuck in the job you swore
was only temporary #

01:41:11.537 --> 01:41:13.372
# Was only temporary #

01:41:13.413 --> 01:41:16.375
# Yeah #

01:41:16.416 --> 01:41:19.545
# Feel like the world
is passing you by #

01:41:19.586 --> 01:41:21.296
# Doo-doo-doo doo-doo #

01:41:21.338 --> 01:41:24.299
# Never done all the things
you wanted to try #

01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:26.468
# Stuck in one place #

01:41:26.552 --> 01:41:28.637
# Got a pain in
your face #

01:41:28.679 --> 01:41:31.306
# From all your stressin' out,
all your stressin' out #

01:41:31.348 --> 01:41:33.141
# All your stressin' out #

01:41:33.183 --> 01:41:36.061
# Hey, you ask
yourself #

01:41:36.103 --> 01:41:38.522
# There's got to
be more #

01:41:38.564 --> 01:41:40.732
# Than what
I'm living for #

01:41:40.774 --> 01:41:42.693
# What I'm living for #

01:41:42.734 --> 01:41:44.278
# What I'm
living for #

01:41:44.319 --> 01:41:46.613
# You ask yourself
there's got to be #

01:41:46.655 --> 01:41:49.283
# Something else #

01:41:49.324 --> 01:41:52.077
# Something more, more #

01:41:52.119 --> 01:41:55.664
# More,
well, let the sun shine #

01:41:55.706 --> 01:41:57.791
# On your face #

01:41:57.833 --> 01:42:00.168
# And don't let your life #

01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:02.963
# Go to waste #

01:42:03.005 --> 01:42:04.464
# Now is the time #

01:42:04.506 --> 01:42:07.718
# Got to make up
your mind #

01:42:07.759 --> 01:42:10.637
# Let it shine on you #

01:42:10.679 --> 01:42:13.765
# Let it shine
on you #

01:42:13.807 --> 01:42:17.102
# Feel like there's nothing,
nowhere to go #

01:42:17.144 --> 01:42:18.937
# Doo-doo-doo doo-doo #

01:42:18.979 --> 01:42:21.899
# You try and fight
but you can't let go #

01:42:21.899 --> 01:42:26.403
# Of all the pain,
got so much to gain #

01:42:26.445 --> 01:42:28.989
# Now is the time #

01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:31.575
# Mm-hmm #

01:42:31.617 --> 01:42:33.744
# You ask yourself #

01:42:33.785 --> 01:42:37.331
# There's got to be
something else #

01:42:37.372 --> 01:42:41.251
# Something more,
more, more #

01:42:41.251 --> 01:42:43.712
# Let the sun shine #

01:42:43.754 --> 01:42:45.881
# On your face #

01:42:45.923 --> 01:42:48.383
# And don't let
your life #

01:42:48.425 --> 01:42:50.802
# Go to waste #

01:42:50.844 --> 01:42:55.599
# Now is the time,
got to make up your mind #

01:42:55.641 --> 01:42:58.518
# Let it shine on you #

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.354
# Let it
shine on you #

01:43:00.395 --> 01:43:03.732
# You ask yourself,
there's got to be #

01:43:03.774 --> 01:43:07.819
# More than what
I'm living for #

01:43:07.861 --> 01:43:10.572
# What I'm living for,
what I'm living for #

01:43:10.614 --> 01:43:13.450
# You ask yourself,
there's got to be #

01:43:13.492 --> 01:43:17.204
# Something else,
something more #

01:43:17.246 --> 01:43:19.748
# More, more #

01:43:19.831 --> 01:43:21.875
# Well, let the sun shine #

01:43:21.917 --> 01:43:24.253
# On your face #

01:43:24.294 --> 01:43:26.755

# Go to waste #

01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:31.260
# Now is the time #

# Got to make up
your mind #

01:43:34.638 --> 01:43:36.807
# Let it shine on you #

01:43:36.848 --> 01:43:38.934
# Let it shine
on you #

01:43:38.976 --> 01:43:41.061
# Let the sun shine #

01:43:41.103 --> 01:43:43.272
# On your face #

01:43:43.313 --> 01:43:45.524
# And don't let your life #

01:43:45.566 --> 01:43:48.151
# Go to waste #

01:43:48.151 --> 01:43:50.237
# Now is the time #

01:43:50.279 --> 01:43:53.282
# Got to make up
your mind #

01:43:53.323 --> 01:43:55.659
# Let it shine on you #

01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:58.245
# Let it shine
on you #

01:43:58.287 --> 01:44:00.414
# Let the sun shine #

01:44:00.455 --> 01:44:02.749
# On your face #

01:44:02.791 --> 01:44:05.210
# And don't let your life #

01:44:05.252 --> 01:44:07.462
# Go to waste #

01:44:07.504 --> 01:44:09.464
# Now is the time #

01:44:09.506 --> 01:44:12.885
# Got to make up
your mind #

01:44:12.926 --> 01:44:15.095
# Let it shine on you #

01:44:15.137 --> 01:44:17.514
# Let it shine
on you. #
