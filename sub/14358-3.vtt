"The Floating Anniversary"

00:06.440 --> 00:09.335
<i>This was supposed
to be my anniversary.</i>

00:09.740 --> 00:11.100
<i>That's me in the car.</i>

00:11.260 --> 00:11.838
Don't wait up,

00:11.873 --> 00:13.610
'cause I don't know
when I'll be home!

00:13.760 --> 00:15.520
<i>As much fun
as this looks,</i>

00:15.650 --> 00:18.860
<i>a couple of days ago,
we had a different plan in mind.</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:23.210
Happy anniversary.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.961
Oh, honey!

00:25.071 --> 00:26.765
I don't have anything
for you.

00:27.330 --> 00:30.350
<i>I had long ago learned
not to get Mike presents.</i>

00:30.385 --> 00:31.319
What the hell is this?

00:33.020 --> 00:34.152
What did you get me
this for?

00:34.710 --> 00:36.640
I mean,
thanks, but...

00:36.810 --> 00:38.180
Seriously
what did you spend on this?

00:38.181 --> 00:39.242
You kept the receipt, right?

00:39.730 --> 00:43.007
<i>This was actually our
16th and 17th anniversary.</i>

00:43.230 --> 00:45.073
<i>We kept postponing
the 16th</i>

00:45.108 --> 00:47.289
<i>until it floated
right into number 17.</i>

00:47.324 --> 00:48.550
I know how busy
you've been,

00:48.680 --> 00:51.047
and you saying how badly
you want to get away, so...

00:52.350 --> 00:55.109
A trip to
the carpet remnants store.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.489
I love it! Oh!

00:59.020 --> 00:59.763
<i>I know.</i>

00:59.821 --> 01:01.514
<i>It's a little pathetic
to get so excited</i>

01:01.549 --> 01:02.650
<i>about a carpet remnant,</i>

01:02.810 --> 01:06.179
<i>but the rug in our bedroom
had some serious mileage on it.</i>

01:07.040 --> 01:09.039
<i>I told you.
I wasn't kidding.</i>

01:09.530 --> 01:12.451
On Friday, I'm taking you
to French Lick.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.150
We'll stay overnight at
the Route 33 motor lodge,

01:15.270 --> 01:17.556
then we'll pick out
our remnant on Saturday

01:17.591 --> 01:18.350
and head back home.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.039
Oh! I love it.

01:21.890 --> 01:23.501
Except for
the heading home part.

01:25.550 --> 01:26.880
Nobody wants to see that.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.031
I think old people
kissing is sweet.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.747
All right,
I think we're done here.

01:30.930 --> 01:32.909
Brick! Packed your lunch!
Let's go!

01:33.330 --> 01:34.957
Hey, could I drive
to school today?

01:35.300 --> 01:35.910
No, not today.

01:35.945 --> 01:36.990
Your mom and I
have a lot to do,

01:37.025 --> 01:38.054
plus we don't want to die.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.120
If I don't get to practice driving,
I'm never gonna get my license.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.365
That's why
we taught you to walk.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.080
Tell you what--if you stop
by the lot after school,

01:45.210 --> 01:47.410
I'll try to sneak you in
for a test-drive, okay?

01:47.530 --> 01:49.040
- Okay.
- Come on, guys. Get going.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.037
You don't want
to miss the bus.

01:50.072 --> 01:50.917
- Let's go.
- Good-bye, Mom.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.399
All right. Have a good day.
See you guys.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.740
Hey--oh.

01:55.775 --> 01:57.650
Mom, I don't feel good.

01:57.810 --> 01:58.851
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

01:58.931 --> 02:00.101
<i>One sick kid could lead</i>

02:00.142 --> 02:01.980
<i>to a whole house
full of sick by Friday,</i>

02:02.130 --> 02:03.845
<i>and there
goes the anniversary.</i>

02:04.170 --> 02:06.220
You're fine. You're not sick.
Positive attitude.

02:06.330 --> 02:07.648
A bus ride
will make you feel better.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.640 --> 02:18.607
I really don't feel good.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.091
Okay.

02:21.110 --> 02:23.655
If you have to throw up,
do it on Mommy's carpet.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.780
<i>The problem is,
I had to work that day.</i>

02:29.920 --> 02:32.361
<i>But when you're a workin' mom,
you gotta get creative.</i>

02:32.396 --> 02:34.495
Okay, there's ginger ale
in the cupholder.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.420
If you need anything,
honk twice.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.991
I wish I could stay home
and watch TV

02:42.026 --> 02:42.940
and have you make me soup.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.662
Oh, sorry, honey.
Wrong family.

02:46.070 --> 02:48.520
Is it against the rules
for me to be here?

02:48.660 --> 02:49.758
Of course not.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.378
Just keep your head
below the window.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.610
<i>Meanwhile, third period
at Sue's school was set aside</i>

02:56.740 --> 02:59.242
<i>so kids could do whatever
clubs they had gotten into.</i>

02:59.940 --> 03:01.720
<i>Since Sue didn't get
into any clubs,</i>

03:01.850 --> 03:04.455
<i>she was sent to the front office
to make student I.Ds--</i>

03:04.830 --> 03:07.635
<i>A job she referred to
as the lamination club.</i>

03:07.740 --> 03:09.560
I'm Brendan Nichols.
This is my first day.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.041
Is this where
I get my I.D. made?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.126
Are you okay?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.870
I'm about done
being Mr. Nice Guy.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.201
The month's almost over,
and sales are...

03:26.000 --> 03:29.350
What in the name of
good God Almighty is that?

03:29.480 --> 03:30.352
It's a houseplant.

03:30.463 --> 03:31.771
A houseplant?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.280
This is not your house.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.480
How many times
have I told you?

03:36.620 --> 03:38.778
No bringing
personal items into work!

03:39.280 --> 03:40.684
The only thing
any of you

03:40.719 --> 03:43.113
need to be worrying about
taking care of is me.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.890
You don't need
a houseplant

03:45.040 --> 03:47.734
stealing your focus from
what you should be working on--

03:47.880 --> 03:49.221
selling cars!

03:49.540 --> 03:51.331
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm not thinking clearly.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.625
I gave blood this morning.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.643
Well, don't do it again.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.181
It was very selfish
of me, sir.

03:58.510 --> 03:59.911
Did they give you
a cookie?

04:17.290 --> 04:17.993
Thanks.

04:34.450 --> 04:38.090
Lou, did you see the red sedan
that was parked here?

04:44.710 --> 04:48.234
Hear that engine?
This baby's got 260 horses.

04:49.570 --> 04:51.335
Can we play
the radio?

04:51.840 --> 04:53.148
<i>Radio!</i>

04:57.010 --> 04:58.690
How could this
have happened?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.720
I purposely put Brick
in the ugliest car

05:00.840 --> 05:03.440
on the whole lot
and marked it up by 25%.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.245
<i>Frankie,
the, uh, "package"</i>

05:06.280 --> 05:08.160
<i>that you left in the back
of the red sedan</i>

05:08.310 --> 05:11.170
<i>has been placed
in the green hatchback,</i>

05:11.560 --> 05:13.721
<i>and Pete says
it needs a Kleenex.</i>

05:14.921 --> 05:17.710
Frances, what the hell
is your son doing here?

05:18.640 --> 05:21.927
Mr. Ehlert, I am so sorry.
It's just been the worst day.

05:22.090 --> 05:22.562
Hey, Mom.

05:24.270 --> 05:26.599
Oh. You're talking
about Axl...

05:27.200 --> 05:31.060
who is here because
he got his learner's permit,

05:31.210 --> 05:33.770
and we are thinking
of buying him a car.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.832
All right! Well,
show him that yellow car.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.326
It's got a tape deck.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.431
You're buying me a car?

05:41.790 --> 05:42.970
Wrong family.

05:43.005 --> 05:43.603
Listen, honey,

05:43.694 --> 05:45.169
this isn't the best day
for driving practice.

05:45.228 --> 05:46.270
I have to find
your brother.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.520
I'll take him out for you.

05:47.670 --> 05:48.848
Are you sure?

05:49.200 --> 05:49.702
Thank you, Bob.

05:49.772 --> 05:51.890
He's really pretty good,
unless he has to turn.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.541
Turn!

05:59.230 --> 06:01.218
So, Ax,
I hear you play football?

06:01.420 --> 06:02.131
Yeah.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.038
I used to play
a little ball myself

06:05.073 --> 06:05.932
when I was your age.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.152
Those days,
they called it foosball.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.435
Wrist used to swell up
something awful.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.245
Seems like yesterday
I was right where you are now.

06:15.870 --> 06:16.624
I tell you, though,

06:16.659 --> 06:20.289
driver's license changes
the whole deal.

06:21.660 --> 06:25.181
Once you're out of
that house, whoo, boy!

06:25.350 --> 06:26.502
No family for me.

06:26.613 --> 06:28.709
It's all Bob, all the time.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.410
If I want to go
to the arcade again tonight

06:31.573 --> 06:33.122
until it closes, I do it.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.257
No family
wondering where I am.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.850
I'm a bag in the wind.

06:45.675 --> 06:46.808
Dude, are you crying?

06:48.170 --> 06:49.280
Eyes on the road.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.300
<i>Hiding Brick all day
had worn me out.</i>

06:54.590 --> 06:56.776
<i>I needed French Lick
now more than ever.</i>

06:56.870 --> 06:57.950
Mom, can I talk to you?

06:58.080 --> 06:59.020
Yeah, sure.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.470
I saw this boy today
at school...

07:00.600 --> 07:02.987
<i>Now I know I should have
been thrilled by this.</i>

07:03.050 --> 07:06.340
<i>My daughter was telling me
about her first big crush.</i>

07:06.490 --> 07:07.721
<i>But I was so tired,</i>

07:07.756 --> 07:09.691
<i>all I could do was
pretend to listen.</i>

07:09.726 --> 07:10.860
When I tried
talking to him...

07:10.990 --> 07:12.782
<i>And then I saw
something amazing,</i>

07:12.872 --> 07:14.087
<i>something I was
beginning to think</i>

07:14.122 --> 07:16.003
<i>I'd never see
in my lifetime.</i>

07:16.950 --> 07:19.277
<i>Brick was making
a sandwich.</i>

07:19.460 --> 07:20.920
<i>Just this morning
he was sick,</i>

07:21.060 --> 07:23.192
<i>and now an actual sandwich.</i>

07:23.410 --> 07:25.195
<i>It was like that guy
who got hit by lightning</i>

07:25.255 --> 07:27.087
<i>and suddenly knew
how to play the piano.</i>

07:27.320 --> 07:28.381
So what do you think?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.187
Is it a good plan?

07:30.460 --> 07:33.167
Uh, sure, honey.
That's a great plan.

07:33.630 --> 07:34.341
Yay!

07:37.760 --> 07:40.324
Brick, did you make
your own lunch?

07:40.990 --> 07:42.254
Did it all by myself.

07:42.450 --> 07:43.160
Hey!

07:43.320 --> 07:45.760
<i>And suddenly,
everything seemed hopeful.</i>

07:45.920 --> 07:48.113
<i>There was one less thing
I would have to do tomorrow</i>

07:48.154 --> 07:49.500
<i>and for the rest
of my life.</i>

07:49.650 --> 07:52.760
<i>Brick would make sandwiches,
Axl would learn to drive,</i>

07:52.930 --> 07:54.921
<i>and soon there would
be time for a trip</i>

07:54.961 --> 07:57.504
<i>to the carpet remnants store
whenever I wanted...</i>

07:58.140 --> 07:59.571
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

07:59.930 --> 08:01.704
- Hello?
- <i>Frankie!</i>

08:01.820 --> 08:03.258
Oh, hi, Aunt Edie.

08:04.030 --> 08:07.422
Uh-huh. Okay.
Be right over.

08:08.450 --> 08:11.220
<i>My aunts Ginny and Edie
had been smoking and coughing</i>

08:11.380 --> 08:13.640
<i>for almost 70 years
without ever considering</i>

08:13.770 --> 08:15.880
<i>there might be a connection
between the two.</i>

08:15.915 --> 08:17.029
Damn arthritis.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.157
I'm sorry to bother you,
but here it is 6:00,

08:20.192 --> 08:22.230
and we can't
open our medicine.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.411
Oh, and another thing--
I failed my driving test today,

08:25.446 --> 08:27.749
so you're going to have
to help get us around.

08:28.030 --> 08:30.970
- What?
- I have a foot appoiment Tuesday,

08:31.130 --> 08:34.169
and she has to get her wheelchair
tuned up on Thursday.

08:34.309 --> 08:37.150
And while it's there,
you'll have to carry her around.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.630
But don't worry.
She's not that heavy anymore.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.496
Okay. Hold on.

08:41.530 --> 08:42.700
I'm gonna have
to write this down.

08:42.830 --> 08:43.533
And, dear,

08:44.145 --> 08:45.682
could you make me
a sandwich?

08:47.680 --> 08:48.705
<i>I should have figured</i>

08:48.745 --> 08:50.341
<i>this was the way
the world worked.</i>

08:50.500 --> 08:52.730
<i>Soon as the kids gain
a shred of independence...</i>

08:52.890 --> 08:54.419
<i>the old folks
spring a leak.</i>

08:57.150 --> 08:58.636
Lost another one.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.688
Lost another one.

09:17.810 --> 09:20.530
<i>Shuttling everyone around
all week had made me nuts,</i>

09:20.650 --> 09:23.510
<i>but at least I had
one thing to look forward to.</i>

09:23.710 --> 09:26.890
Okay, Mike.
I'm all packed for tonight.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.870
Oh, but I need you
to swing by the mall at 5:00

09:28.905 --> 09:30.770
and pick up Aunt Ginny
at the eyeglass place.

09:30.940 --> 09:33.858
But we should be on
the road by 8:00, 8:30 tops.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.183
Sounds like
somebody wants to get

09:36.242 --> 09:38.440
to the Route 33
motor lodge.

09:38.830 --> 09:39.917
Mike!

09:41.419 --> 09:43.140
Do you two even know
what you look like?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.575
Okay, listen, Axl,

09:44.690 --> 09:45.281
you're in charge,

09:45.322 --> 09:46.970
and I want you to know
we trust you.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.208
Then I should have
the car keys

09:48.243 --> 09:50.003
in case there's,
you know, an emergency.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.572
I trust you with the kids,
not the car.

09:53.190 --> 09:54.309
Blah.

09:56.210 --> 09:59.140
Sue, what is that
you're wearing?

09:59.310 --> 10:01.835
It's my idea for telling
Brendan that I like him.

10:02.990 --> 10:05.747
R-remember?
You said it was a great plan.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.001
Honey...

10:09.750 --> 10:10.614
Hello?

10:10.780 --> 10:12.580
<i>We just heard
from the doctor.</i>

10:12.730 --> 10:16.000
It's emphysema.
Oh, Frankie!

10:16.140 --> 10:18.720
I don't know how
I'm gonna live without her.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.382
Calm down.
Just calm down.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.203
I'll be right there.

10:22.610 --> 10:25.590
Sue, just please
change the shirt.

10:25.730 --> 10:27.280
We'll talk more later.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.110
Aunt Ginny,
I am so sorry. I...

10:40.510 --> 10:41.661
It's the dog?

10:41.913 --> 10:43.996
The dog has emphysema?

10:44.790 --> 10:46.283
Poor Doris.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.234
How could this
have happened?

10:58.420 --> 10:59.455
You're kidding, right?

10:59.490 --> 11:00.849
Hey, the vet says

11:00.884 --> 11:02.530
she has to be in
a smoke-free environment

11:02.680 --> 11:04.345
until she regenerates
lung tissue.

11:04.392 --> 11:05.575
What could I say?

11:06.260 --> 11:07.804
So what,
now we're not going?

11:08.020 --> 11:10.520
I-I don't know. I mean,
the kids can't watch her.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.300
You can't leave her alone
for more than 15 minutes,

11:12.440 --> 11:14.263
or she chokes
on her own saliva.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.130
And someone has to change
the nicotine patch,

11:16.270 --> 11:17.861
because she's going
through withdrawal.

11:18.090 --> 11:19.440
Perfect.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.691
Look, I want to go
on the trip, Mike.

11:22.860 --> 11:24.990
Believe me,
I need this trip, okay?

11:25.130 --> 11:26.590
I eat standing up
at the counter.

11:26.625 --> 11:27.907
I've been reading
the same one article

11:27.908 --> 11:29.190
in "People" magazine
for a month.

11:29.330 --> 11:31.122
No one wants to get away
more than me.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.061
Your problem is,
you're letting these people

11:34.091 --> 11:36.500
control your whole life.
Aunt Ginny has a son.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.532
Well, you know
Travis is in prison.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.880
And Aunt Edie's kid
fried his brain huffing paint.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.550
He's literally the village
idiot of Terre Haute.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.360
What about your mom?

11:44.480 --> 11:46.390
Mom's in Des Moines
taking care of Grandma.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.647
How the hell long do
people live in your family?

11:48.730 --> 11:50.480
You do for family, Mike.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.640
That's all there is to it.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.020
Maybe if you did
a little less for family,

11:53.170 --> 11:54.053
they'd start dying off,

11:54.088 --> 11:55.598
and we could have
a damn vacation.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.081
Oh! Hello?

12:00.510 --> 12:01.360
What?

12:01.790 --> 12:03.400
No, no,
I've been at work all day.

12:03.450 --> 12:04.409
Mike was supposed to...

12:05.650 --> 12:07.341
Okay, just stay put.

12:07.481 --> 12:08.937
I-I'll be right there.

12:10.946 --> 12:12.796
You forgot
to pick up Aunt Ginny.

12:12.979 --> 12:14.054
You forgot
to remind me.

12:14.055 --> 12:16.081
How many times
do I have to remind you?

12:16.116 --> 12:18.785
Do you want me to pin a note
to your shirt like a child?

12:18.820 --> 12:20.199
No, you should have
stuck it on my thermos,

12:20.250 --> 12:21.343
like you always do.

12:22.490 --> 12:23.653
I'm gonna go pick up
Aunt Ginny.

12:23.712 --> 12:27.023
Could you please remember
to take the dog outside

12:27.058 --> 12:28.393
so it can do
its business?

12:28.870 --> 12:32.160
- The dog's in a diaper.
- It doesn't know it's in a diaper!

12:32.300 --> 12:35.850
It'll only go if it's outside!
God.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.148
<i>And so that's
how Mike and I</i>

12:41.179 --> 12:42.810
<i>had a big, ol' nasty fight</i>

12:42.980 --> 12:44.892
<i>on what should have been
the loving celebration</i>

12:44.964 --> 12:47.666
<i>of our 16th and
17th anniversaries.</i>

12:47.760 --> 12:48.510
And don't wait up,

12:48.582 --> 12:50.304
'cause I don't know
when I'll be home!

12:52.520 --> 12:54.571
Diapering a damn dog.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.116
Where's Mom?

12:56.530 --> 12:58.292
Driving the old-mobile.

12:58.710 --> 13:01.194
Well, can I ask you
a question about a boy?

13:01.710 --> 13:03.012
I'd rather you not.

13:05.490 --> 13:08.302
Okay, okay.
No, it's okay.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.624
Well, his name is
Brendan.

13:11.930 --> 13:13.531
I'm trying
to get his attention.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.000
Well, don't do anything sexual.
Boys hate that.

13:17.035 --> 13:17.968
Well, what did Mom do

13:18.029 --> 13:19.358
when she wanted you
to notice her?

13:20.370 --> 13:21.920
Well, with your mother,
it was the other way.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.115
She didn't know
I was alive.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.026
I had to make a grand gesture,
so I went to a friend's barn...

13:29.140 --> 13:30.000
"Lisa"?

13:30.140 --> 13:31.990
Well, your mom didn't like me
very much when we first met,

13:32.110 --> 13:33.608
so she told me
her name was Lisa.

13:34.050 --> 13:36.265
But hey, it got me here,
didn't it?

13:36.450 --> 13:39.166
Wow.
A grand gesture, huh?

13:39.950 --> 13:41.113
Thanks, Dad.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.303
Yep. It got me here.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.018
So how was
the big weekend?

13:51.220 --> 13:52.514
Didn't happen.

13:52.710 --> 13:54.240
Mike and I
got in this big fight.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.853
I mean, he says
I try to take on too much

13:55.888 --> 13:56.988
with the kids
and my aunts,

13:57.039 --> 13:58.350
but what am I
supposed to do?

13:58.490 --> 14:00.286
Everybody needs
something from me.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.143
That must be hard...

14:03.080 --> 14:04.039
Being needed.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.124
I could tell you
about my life,

14:08.204 --> 14:09.569
but I don't want
to make you jealous...

14:11.280 --> 14:13.609
Ever mention how
I'm a bag in the wind?

14:13.680 --> 14:16.195
I'm just so tired,
and now Mike's mad at me.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.534
Hey, before you can take care
of your relationship,

14:18.870 --> 14:20.202
you need
to take care of you.

14:20.940 --> 14:21.926
You're exhausted,

14:22.019 --> 14:23.644
and you need to take
a little break, all right?

14:23.810 --> 14:25.102
- Right now.
- I can't!

14:25.137 --> 14:26.980
Of course you can.
You deserve it.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.270
The world's
not gonna stop turning

14:28.305 --> 14:29.280
if you take 15 minutes.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.800
Ehlert will be all over me
'cause I didn't make the coffee.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.150
I'll do it, all right?

14:33.270 --> 14:35.300
That's my anniversary gift
to you, all right?

14:36.050 --> 14:37.478
Go. Enjoy.

14:45.410 --> 14:48.270
<i>Bob was right.
I did need 15 minutes.</i>

14:48.440 --> 14:50.973
<i>I mean, it wasn't French Lick,
but it was something.</i>

15:36.460 --> 15:37.949
<i>When it was over...</i>

15:38.220 --> 15:41.491
<i>I knew that had been the most
worthwhile 15 minutes of my life.</i>

15:41.840 --> 15:43.754
<i>Sometimes you don't know
how badly</i>

15:43.789 --> 15:45.100
<i>you need
something until--</i>

15:45.320 --> 15:45.939
<i>What the--</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:50.319
Who in the hell
made the coffee?

15:54.730 --> 15:56.707
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

15:56.990 --> 15:58.944
<i>Mom, Mom!</i>

15:59.280 --> 16:02.859
<i>Mom,
I am so, so sorry.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:04.240
Are you all right?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.786
All right, all right.
Hold on. One at a time.

16:09.070 --> 16:11.223
It is the most
humiliating thing

16:11.258 --> 16:13.381
that has ever happened
to anyone.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.326
Honey, I'm sure
it's not as bad as that.

16:16.150 --> 16:17.770
<i>It was.</i>

16:17.990 --> 16:20.586
<i>Bit by bit, I was able to piece
together what had happened.</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:22.672
<i>It seems the phrase
"grand gesture"</i>

16:22.743 --> 16:25.244
<i>had stayed with Sue
after her talk with Mike.</i>

16:27.240 --> 16:29.968
Um, this is Sue Heck

16:30.058 --> 16:33.388
with a special message
for Brendan Nichols.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.846
<i># Why do birds #</i>

16:37.026 --> 16:40.128
# suddenly appear #

16:40.129 --> 16:42.015
<i># Every time #</i>

16:42.504 --> 16:44.891
<i># you are near? #</i>

16:45.677 --> 16:50.224
# Just like me,
they long to be #

16:50.455 --> 16:54.282
# Close to you #

17:04.450 --> 17:06.420
<i>It was a girl's
worst nightmare.</i>

17:06.454 --> 17:08.005
<i>Everyone in the school
was laughing</i>

17:08.040 --> 17:09.710
<i>about that ridiculous
Sue Heck.</i>

17:09.740 --> 17:12.714
<i>The only bright spot was
no one knew who Sue Heck was.</i>

17:13.919 --> 17:15.746
<i>Meanwhile,
Axl was offered</i>

17:15.781 --> 17:17.835
<i>a rare chance
to practice his driving.</i>

17:17.910 --> 17:21.730
Hey, Mom. Uh, Aunt Edie asked
me to drive her to the mall,

17:21.731 --> 17:24.672
so if you don't call me back
and say no in 60 seconds,

17:24.707 --> 17:26.109
I'll assume
you're okay with it.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.368
<i>While at the same time,</i>

17:30.403 --> 17:32.450
<i>Brick had decided
to take the dog for a pull</i>

17:32.485 --> 17:34.478
<i>to show off
the many sights of Orson.</i>

17:34.950 --> 17:36.625
This is my favorite place.

17:36.860 --> 17:38.900
You're the first person--or dog--

17:39.030 --> 17:40.303
that I've ever brought here.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.323
<i>Apparently,
Brick's favorite place</i>

17:44.414 --> 17:46.544
<i>was also Sue's
favorite place to cry.</i>

17:47.180 --> 17:48.301
Sue?

17:50.580 --> 17:52.978
Oh, no. Doris!

18:00.190 --> 18:02.980
Uh, Aunt Edie,
I don't think that's okay.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.316
It's all right.
It's my driving beer.

18:07.410 --> 18:09.712
Isn't that Doris?

18:22.220 --> 18:24.247
Ma'am, I already spoke
to your aunt,

18:24.390 --> 18:25.912
but I need to clear up
a few things with you.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.473
I understand your children

18:27.534 --> 18:28.490
were trying to get
in touch with you?

18:28.620 --> 18:29.847
I am so sorry.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.180
I just turned off my phone
for 15 minutes.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.380
You turned off
your phone

18:34.190 --> 18:35.100
but you're a mom.

18:35.190 --> 18:36.626
I just needed a break.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.833
From what?
Being a mom?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.362
No. Well, yes.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.963
Okay. I just have
one question for you.

18:44.964 --> 18:47.522
Why didn't a single one of you
think to call your father?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.431
Dad hates it
when we call him at work.

18:53.670 --> 18:56.322
<i>And so I decided
to stop fighting it.</i>

18:56.550 --> 19:00.185
<i>Maybe Queen Elizabeth
or Julia Roberts</i>

19:00.256 --> 19:02.018
<i>could take 15 minutes
in the bathroom</i>

19:02.019 --> 19:03.780
<i>with maxi pads
on their eyes</i>

19:03.930 --> 19:06.011
<i>or plan a trip to
the carpet remnants store,</i>

19:06.156 --> 19:07.038
<i>but not me.</i>

19:07.073 --> 19:08.800
<i>I had flown too close
to the sun,</i>

19:08.960 --> 19:10.429
<i>and I had paid the price.</i>

19:11.220 --> 19:13.076
Frankie, I've got to show you
someting in the car.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.410
What, now?

19:19.840 --> 19:21.447
So what did you
wanna show me?

19:23.999 --> 19:24.652
Buckle up!

19:25.350 --> 19:28.244
What, Mike?
Wait, what are you doing?

19:28.380 --> 19:30.084
It's our
almost-18th anniversary,

19:30.124 --> 19:33.190
I'm taking you to French Lick
and buying you a carpet remnant.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.867
Mike, okay, look.
Stop!

19:34.927 --> 19:36.698
Look, you can't just do this.

19:36.738 --> 19:38.172
This is crazy! 

19:38.300 --> 19:39.710
I don't even have
my phone.

19:39.799 --> 19:41.100
What about the kids?

19:41.250 --> 19:43.300
And--and Aunt Ginny
and Aunt Edie?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.810
Took care of it.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.920
<i>Turns out,
after all these years,</i>

19:54.001 --> 19:55.196
<i>Mike's a genius.</i>

19:55.360 --> 19:58.392
Okay!
Time to turn off the TV.

19:58.427 --> 20:01.080
And have a little
family conversation.

20:03.191 --> 20:04.988
So who watched
last week's Wife Swap?

20:05.150 --> 20:06.360
Alright, I'll tell you
all about it.

20:06.662 --> 20:07.633
So there's this couple,
right--

20:07.668 --> 20:09.145
<i>Mike was able to get
Bob to give up</i>

20:09.194 --> 20:11.431
<i>his free-wheeling
bag-in-the-wind lifestyle</i>

20:11.466 --> 20:13.080
<i>and have a family
for one night.</i>

20:13.115 --> 20:14.787
Again, I'm not trying
to hurt you.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.573
I'm just trying to tell you
about the best episode.

20:16.574 --> 20:18.690
- I loved it!
- <i>And as for Mike and I,</i>

20:18.720 --> 20:19.230
Happy?

20:20.410 --> 20:21.377
Yeah.

20:21.790 --> 20:24.583
- Route 33 motor lodge?
- Never disappoints.

20:24.630 --> 20:25.496
And the remnants?

20:26.480 --> 20:27.426
So beautiful.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.058
No natural fibers.

20:30.190 --> 20:31.840
It's a shame
we have to take it home

20:31.910 --> 20:33.355
and let it get
all covered with...

20:34.380 --> 20:35.255
life.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.264
You're right.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.529
I think we need
to take 15 minutes.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.130
<i>This isn't
the easiest phase of life.</i>

20:49.460 --> 20:51.252
<i>You've got young people
and old people</i>

20:51.287 --> 20:53.405
<i>pulling at you
from both directions.</i>

20:53.640 --> 20:54.603
<i>But it's not so bad</i>

20:54.673 --> 20:56.750
<i>as long as you've got
somebody in there with you.</i>

20:57.240 --> 21:00.440
<i>And that's something you gotta
remember to celebrate.</i>
