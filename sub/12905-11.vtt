00:19.506 --> 00:20.636
Well, this is it.

00:21.099 --> 00:23.320
If Grandma were here, she'd be
proud we were doing this.

00:23.322 --> 00:25.942
If she were here, she'd tell me
I look fat in this dress.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.801
And that my beard is a health hazard.

00:27.803 --> 00:29.052
She smelled like compost.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.917
I liked her. She had candies.

00:32.846 --> 00:34.504
All right. Let's get it over with.

00:44.362 --> 00:46.352
We bury her with her rock collection?

00:46.354 --> 00:47.978
I-I'm gonna drop her, guys.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.239
Some help here!

00:58.822 --> 01:00.256
I swear this wasn't me.

01:04.007 --> 01:06.859
Do you know what this
announcement is all about?

01:06.861 --> 01:08.114
It's Jane's news.

01:08.388 --> 01:11.041
Just tell me. I'll act all surprised.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.597
Did I mention that I'm doing
rounds at the clinic now?

01:13.599 --> 01:15.388
I'm gonna see three patients today.

01:15.390 --> 01:16.915
Okay. Good for you.

01:16.917 --> 01:17.977
What's the news?

01:17.979 --> 01:19.138
I don't want to spoil it.

01:19.140 --> 01:20.233
Spoil what?

01:20.235 --> 01:21.495
Your announcement.

01:21.497 --> 01:22.822
You didn't tell her, did you?

01:22.824 --> 01:23.917
I would never!

01:23.919 --> 01:24.787
All right, what's going on?

01:24.789 --> 01:25.930
I need to know.

01:28.036 --> 01:29.140
Um...

01:29.641 --> 01:31.705
I'm gonna be an instructor at the FBI.

01:32.085 --> 01:33.497
The FBI!

01:36.033 --> 01:37.524
The FBI?

01:37.841 --> 01:38.775
Yeah.

01:40.284 --> 01:42.022
In Washington, D.C.?

01:42.024 --> 01:43.043
Yes.

01:43.564 --> 01:44.733
I'm leaving the force.

01:44.735 --> 01:46.574
I thought that you would be thrilled.

01:46.576 --> 01:51.192
I mean, I just never considered
that you being safe

01:51.194 --> 01:55.007
would... mean moving 500 miles away.

01:55.009 --> 01:58.321
343...  nautical miles.

01:58.323 --> 02:00.863
It's 7 hours and 7 minutes via route 15.

02:02.171 --> 02:06.008
Well, that's still really far
for a cup of coffee.

02:09.935 --> 02:11.941
When is this happening?

02:13.148 --> 02:16.057
There's still a lot of details
to work out...

02:16.059 --> 02:19.370
my... my background check,
things like that.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.676
I haven't told BPD.

02:20.678 --> 02:23.336
I just, you know, wanted you to know.

02:27.507 --> 02:30.649
My daughter, the FBI agent.

02:32.156 --> 02:34.029
I-Instructor.

02:35.804 --> 02:37.476
I'm proud of you, Janie.

02:37.478 --> 02:39.149
- Yeah?
- Yes.

02:40.122 --> 02:41.960
I love you.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.157
I love you, too.

02:44.525 --> 02:47.148
I've never been to Washington, D.C.

02:48.146 --> 02:49.690
It's just like any other big city.

02:49.692 --> 02:52.301
Where you can sit in
on a session of Congress.

02:52.303 --> 02:56.049
Or see the world's largest
collection of the Bard's works.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.086
What's Bard?

02:57.088 --> 02:59.061
Who cares? Okay, don't say "the Bard."

02:59.063 --> 03:01.002
- No... Nobody says "the Bard."
- All right.

03:01.004 --> 03:02.542
Well, the Smithsonian has an exhibit

03:02.544 --> 03:04.613
on modern medicine in the Great War.

03:05.222 --> 03:06.224
Pass.

03:06.226 --> 03:07.629
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

03:07.631 --> 03:09.236
Angela, tell her.

03:09.238 --> 03:12.314
Yeah, well, it wouldn't kill you
to have some culture, Janie.

03:12.316 --> 03:16.402
But Janie don't like buildings
where she can't touch the walls.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.806
Honey, you're the FBI.

03:18.808 --> 03:21.287
You can touch anything you want.

03:21.988 --> 03:23.325
Okay.

03:48.091 --> 03:49.696
Come on!

03:49.698 --> 03:52.407
Phyllis Henderson, 88... natural causes.

03:52.409 --> 03:53.583
Today is her fu...

03:53.585 --> 03:55.216
<i>was</i> her funeral.

03:55.923 --> 03:57.425
Party crasher.

03:58.031 --> 03:59.970
Who is he? We're running prints.

03:59.972 --> 04:01.548
He obviously didn't have
his wallet on him.

04:02.081 --> 04:04.087
Yeah, can you get a tarp
and cover them up?

04:04.089 --> 04:05.459
The family's right there.

04:05.461 --> 04:06.721
The family's okay with it.

04:06.723 --> 04:08.604
I asked the oldest grandson
if he recognized our victim.

04:08.606 --> 04:11.281
He said, "Maybe Grandma
used him for food."

04:11.283 --> 04:15.767
And in this scenario, was Granny
a cannibal or a vampire?

04:15.769 --> 04:17.372
Either way, they're good.

04:19.415 --> 04:21.321
You know, the ancient Egyptians believed

04:21.322 --> 04:23.263
that burying them together would ensure

04:23.265 --> 04:25.171
that they're together in the afterlife.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.178
Well, maybe Granny will knit him a cozy.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.019
Yeah, a loincloth for the afterlife.

04:29.021 --> 04:32.198
It looks like he's been dead
for about 12 hours.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.005
This is a very odd wound.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.247
It appears that he got run through

04:36.249 --> 04:38.121
with some sort of cylindrical object.

04:38.123 --> 04:39.766
And he's very clean.

04:40.098 --> 04:42.807
Yes, but a wound like this
would have bled profusely.

04:42.809 --> 04:44.112
The family said that the funeral was

04:44.114 --> 04:46.555
at Mason Funeral Home in Mission Hill.

04:46.557 --> 04:48.153
They had the casket
until the hearse picked it up

04:48.155 --> 04:49.185
and brought it here this morning.

04:49.187 --> 04:51.616
I hate funeral homes.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.079
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.

04:54.081 --> 04:56.376
I'm sure someday,

04:56.378 --> 04:59.505
all of you will look back
on this and laugh.

05:04.734 --> 05:06.729
Some sooner than others.

05:14.074 --> 05:15.118
Hi, Grandma!

05:15.120 --> 05:17.715
T.J.!

05:17.717 --> 05:20.378
Oh, what a wonderful surprise!

05:20.380 --> 05:23.508
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

05:23.510 --> 05:24.473
Where's your daddy?

05:24.475 --> 05:26.171
Hey, Ma. I was feeding the meter.

05:26.173 --> 05:28.268
Hey, don't "Hey, Ma" me.

05:28.903 --> 05:30.066
Why didn't you call?

05:30.068 --> 05:32.031
I had no idea you were coming.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.362
We wanted to surprise you.

05:33.364 --> 05:35.227
T.J.'s been asking about you.

05:35.229 --> 05:37.224
And I needed to see some Rizzoli faces

05:37.226 --> 05:38.656
besides the one in the mirror.

05:38.658 --> 05:40.153
Oh, are you a bad liar.

05:40.155 --> 05:41.419
How do you know?

05:41.421 --> 05:43.339
- You got spies in Chicago?
- Oh...

05:43.341 --> 05:46.345
Hey, Teri. This is T.J.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.810
And you know, Teri's got
some ice cream in the back.

05:48.812 --> 05:49.883
Want some?

05:50.515 --> 05:52.677
Yes. Yes.

05:52.702 --> 05:54.465
Go ahead.

05:58.173 --> 05:59.702
So...

06:02.061 --> 06:04.216
Lydia met somebody else.

06:04.792 --> 06:05.621
Oh.

06:06.456 --> 06:09.550
Yeah, I just...
felt like it would be best

06:09.552 --> 06:10.881
to make a clean break.

06:12.621 --> 06:13.961
I'm sorry.

06:14.578 --> 06:16.974
I'm sure this is
a difficult time for you.

06:16.976 --> 06:20.503
Yeah, it has been,
but we'll get through it.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.686
Just need to figure out
what we're doing next.

06:23.168 --> 06:25.458
All right. I'll <i> tell</i> you
what you're gonna do.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.427
T.J.'s having some ice cream.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.425
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

06:29.427 --> 06:31.223
And then we'll go to Jane's townhouse.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.887
She's got an extra room.

06:32.889 --> 06:34.018
Are you sure?

06:34.020 --> 06:35.517
I mean, it's two of us now.

06:35.519 --> 06:38.879
Tommy, if I told you once,
I've told you a hundred times...

06:38.881 --> 06:42.075
There can't be too many Rizzolis!

06:42.077 --> 06:44.078
I missed you.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.390
Missed you, too, Ma.

06:52.464 --> 06:53.529
Okay.

06:53.531 --> 06:57.095
For the record,
when it's my time, not this.

06:57.690 --> 06:58.814
Anything but this.

06:58.816 --> 07:00.752
I've always wanted to see
a Viking funeral.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.017
What, like burial at sea?

07:02.019 --> 07:03.898
Yeah, but they light you on fire first.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.311
I'm in.

07:08.056 --> 07:09.735
Yeah.

07:14.294 --> 07:15.290
May I help you?

07:15.292 --> 07:17.188
Yes, uh, we need to speak to someone

07:17.190 --> 07:19.884
regarding Phyllis Henderson's
funeral, please.

07:19.886 --> 07:21.259
That service was this morning.

07:21.261 --> 07:23.038
Mr. Mason, our owner,
handled those arrangements.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.380
Do you know where we could find him?

07:24.382 --> 07:25.655
I haven't seen him.

07:26.797 --> 07:27.735
Korsak.

07:30.386 --> 07:31.377
Excuse me.

07:32.715 --> 07:34.069
Is this Mr. Mason?

07:34.358 --> 07:35.362
Yes.

07:35.486 --> 07:36.457
Is everything all right?

07:36.553 --> 07:38.161
Is there a family member
we could talk to?

07:38.337 --> 07:40.482
Uh, yeah. His sister's in the prep room.

07:40.484 --> 07:41.884
Thank you very much.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.419
Something tells me this case
is gonna be a weird one.

07:46.421 --> 07:47.514
Mm-hmm.

07:53.936 --> 07:55.654
Ugh. It's freezing in here.

07:56.218 --> 07:57.760
<i>He</i> probably doesn't mind.

07:58.465 --> 07:59.436
Hello?

07:59.438 --> 08:01.042
I'll be right there.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.065
Korsak.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.575
Is that blood?

08:06.985 --> 08:08.079
Could be castoff.

08:09.421 --> 08:10.072
Oh.

08:11.212 --> 08:13.458
Oh, that would make
a nice murder weapon.

08:15.976 --> 08:17.632
Could we be standing in our crime scene?

08:20.974 --> 08:22.146
Hello?

08:22.148 --> 08:23.736
Kate Mason?

08:24.027 --> 08:24.961
Yes.

08:25.697 --> 08:27.127
Can I help you?

08:30.934 --> 08:33.659
My brother's body
was in Mrs. Henderson's casket?

08:34.023 --> 08:35.159
Yes.

08:35.821 --> 08:37.442
I'm gonna need to ask you
a couple questions.

08:39.171 --> 08:41.602
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

08:42.327 --> 08:43.648
Last night, around 8:00.

08:44.714 --> 08:47.058
He was finishing with
Mrs. Henderson when I left.

08:49.641 --> 08:51.619
Why are they taking my trocar?

08:51.892 --> 08:52.674
Your what?

08:52.676 --> 08:54.898
Trocar... it's used
to suction fluids out of organs

08:54.900 --> 08:56.937
in the abdominal cavity.

08:57.053 --> 08:58.313
Well, it's possible that your brother

08:58.315 --> 09:00.017
was stabbed with a similar object.

09:00.019 --> 09:02.540
CSRU found this in the incinerator.

09:03.394 --> 09:04.790
That's Sam's apron.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.245
They burned his clothes?
Why would someone do that?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.438
Probably so he couldn't be traced

09:08.440 --> 09:09.972
back to your funeral home.

09:09.974 --> 09:12.563
Who else has access to
the prep room, besides yourself?

09:12.565 --> 09:14.949
Sam and I are usually
the only ones who go in there.

09:14.951 --> 09:16.653
It upsets most people.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.426
Wait... Are you asking me that
because you think

09:18.428 --> 09:20.135
I had something to do with this?

09:20.678 --> 09:22.714
I did not hurt my brother.

09:22.716 --> 09:25.006
We said good night, and I went bowling.

09:25.008 --> 09:26.710
That was the last time I saw him.

09:26.712 --> 09:28.347
We'll need you to confirm that.

09:28.349 --> 09:29.461
Of course.

09:30.155 --> 09:32.744
You should talk to that woman
he's been seeing.

09:32.746 --> 09:33.877
What woman?

09:33.879 --> 09:36.495
I saw her pick him up after work
a few times.

09:36.497 --> 09:37.995
I figured he had a new girlfriend

09:37.997 --> 09:39.358
he wasn't ready to tell me about.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.199
Would that have been typical of him?

09:41.201 --> 09:43.756
No. He didn't really keep secrets.

09:43.758 --> 09:45.288
And he'd been jumpy about it, you know?

09:45.290 --> 09:47.187
Like something was on his mind.

09:47.189 --> 09:49.186
All right. We'll be in touch.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.204
Are you sure it was him?

09:51.986 --> 09:54.316
Yes. I'm sorry.

10:05.111 --> 10:07.208
Hi. Thank you.

10:07.210 --> 10:09.778
Mr. Gomez, please come in.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.647
The doctor will see you now.

10:14.919 --> 10:17.366
Hello. I'm Dr. Isles.

10:18.089 --> 10:20.391
Uh, they don't really speak English.

10:20.393 --> 10:22.094
We were waiting for Dr. Hope.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.628
I'm sorry. She's out of town.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.231
I'm covering for her.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.856
Dr. Hope has always been there
for our family.

10:29.904 --> 10:31.671
Well, I'm her daughter.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.298
I'm not as experienced as her,
but I'll do my best to help.

10:38.587 --> 10:39.560
_

10:41.818 --> 10:42.884
Is this Ana?

10:43.105 --> 10:44.318
Yes.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.822
Doctors at the hospital
say that she will die,

10:47.097 --> 10:49.883
that there's nothing
that they can do to help her.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.353
Hello.

10:58.604 --> 11:00.146
She's beautiful.

11:03.877 --> 11:07.914
According to her bloodwork,
Ana has biliary atresia.

11:07.916 --> 11:09.140
Her liver is failing.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.719
It could be related
to her autoimmune system.

11:11.721 --> 11:14.325
We're not fully sure,
but it <i> is</i> terminal.

11:14.957 --> 11:16.070
Can you help her?

11:16.560 --> 11:18.593
Well, currently, there is no treatment

11:18.595 --> 11:20.428
for this condition and no cure,

11:20.430 --> 11:23.265
so I'm afraid I have to agree
with Ana's other doctors.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.367
The best we can do
is make her comfortable.

11:25.369 --> 11:27.304
Until she dies?

11:31.845 --> 11:33.478
Uh...

11:36.562 --> 11:38.684
Well, her alkaline phosphatase tests...

11:38.686 --> 11:40.853
... look dangerously high.

11:43.058 --> 11:44.891
Do you mind if we pray for you?

11:45.594 --> 11:46.761
Of course not.

11:46.955 --> 11:50.364
But I must emphasize... the prognosis,

11:50.366 --> 11:53.568
it's... it's out of my hands.

11:53.570 --> 11:54.669
We agree.

11:57.894 --> 12:00.343
It is in much higher hands than yours.

12:05.985 --> 12:08.486
My god, thanks for everything.

12:08.963 --> 12:12.048
_ Bless the doctor, bless the baby.

12:12.408 --> 12:14.089
_ Bless my family.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.216
_ Please help us.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.823
_ Thanks for my sister.

12:19.275 --> 12:21.275
_ Thanks for my family.

12:22.539 --> 12:25.239
I can't believe Sam was murdered.

12:25.241 --> 12:26.535
It's awful.

12:26.911 --> 12:28.143
His cellphone records show

12:28.145 --> 12:29.886
that you two communicated a lot lately.

12:30.614 --> 12:31.647
That's true.

12:31.649 --> 12:32.816
Cleaning staff at the funeral home said

12:32.818 --> 12:34.017
they saw you there last night.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.251
I was supposed to meet him,

12:35.253 --> 12:36.553
but he was gone by the time I arrived.

12:36.555 --> 12:37.849
Were you there for a date?

12:38.157 --> 12:39.557
What? No.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.194
I'm a broker. He hired me
to sell his business.

12:42.305 --> 12:44.295
- The funeral home?
- Yes.

12:44.298 --> 12:46.898
He said he wanted to sell
as quickly as possible.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.868
I had an offer
from a big chain mortuary,

12:48.870 --> 12:51.121
and I was bringing him
the papers to sign.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.273
Did he say why he was selling?

12:54.310 --> 12:56.443
He said he was fed up with the business.

12:56.445 --> 12:57.946
I figured they had money problems.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.640
A lot of these places do.

13:00.383 --> 13:01.916
He was in such a hurry to sell.

13:01.918 --> 13:05.187
He told me he'd even sell
undervalue if necessary.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.669
What did Kate Mason
have to say about that?

13:09.194 --> 13:09.941
Who?

13:10.395 --> 13:12.687
His sister and business partner.

13:13.863 --> 13:16.841
He never mentioned anything
to me about a business partner.

13:17.115 --> 13:19.512
He said he wanted out
as quickly as possible.

13:23.491 --> 13:24.951
He was trying to sell
the family business

13:24.953 --> 13:26.547
from right under her nose
without telling her.

13:26.549 --> 13:27.776
And for no apparent reason.

13:27.778 --> 13:29.106
The funeral home was in the black.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.435
So were his personal accounts.

13:30.437 --> 13:31.798
Maybe he was just sick of it.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.017
Well, I get that,
but why not tell the sister?

13:34.670 --> 13:36.949
He was trying to rip her off,
and she found out?

13:36.951 --> 13:38.113
Here you go.

13:38.115 --> 13:39.276
Yeah, and then she stabbed him

13:39.278 --> 13:42.034
with the... organy suctiony thing.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.095
- Trocar.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:44.097 --> 13:45.229
Thanks.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.193
Her alibi checked out. She <i> was</i> bowling.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.543
Till 10:00. I mean,
she still could have done it.

13:50.545 --> 13:52.338
Okay, this is, like, 90% foam.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.568
What is <i> yours?</i>

13:55.498 --> 13:56.692
What?

13:56.694 --> 13:58.354
I got an interesting call
earlier this week.

13:58.356 --> 13:59.424
Yeah?

13:59.426 --> 14:01.800
From the FBI, vetting their newest hire.

14:04.479 --> 14:05.749
I was gonna tell you about it.

14:05.751 --> 14:07.254
When you handed me your resignation?

14:07.256 --> 14:10.332
N-No. When the... the time was right.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.804
Which is when?

14:11.806 --> 14:14.848
Which is when I can think about
not seeing you every day

14:14.850 --> 14:15.986
and not cry about it...

14:15.988 --> 14:18.696
which is... not now, so...

14:18.698 --> 14:20.737
Okay, this is a $5 cup of crap!

14:20.739 --> 14:22.017
Just so you know...

14:22.882 --> 14:24.718
I think what you're doing
is really great.

14:26.795 --> 14:27.617
Really?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.938
I'm happy for you.

14:29.940 --> 14:33.055
And I don't want to make you cry, but...

14:33.921 --> 14:35.391
I'll miss you.

14:39.408 --> 14:40.812
What'd you tell them?

14:41.284 --> 14:44.859
Oh, I gave them
a thorough character assessment.

14:48.308 --> 14:50.012
What does that mean?

14:54.631 --> 14:55.867
Hi.

14:55.869 --> 14:57.139
Do you find anything?

14:57.141 --> 14:58.844
Not much, but I did confirm

14:58.846 --> 15:01.120
that the blood spatter
on the ceiling was his.

15:01.122 --> 15:02.759
Well, <i>that's</i> something.

15:02.761 --> 15:05.168
Actual cause of death was
transverse thoracic impalement,

15:05.170 --> 15:06.440
likely from the trocar.

15:06.442 --> 15:07.912
How gross is that thing?

15:07.914 --> 15:09.652
Well, I'd say it's rather innovative.

15:09.654 --> 15:10.856
I mean, how else would you propose

15:10.858 --> 15:12.495
draining fluids from a body?

15:12.706 --> 15:13.767
I <i> don't.</i>

15:13.769 --> 15:15.807
Because I'm having a Viking funeral.

15:15.809 --> 15:16.845
Mm-hmm.

15:16.847 --> 15:18.685
Korsak is gonna shoot a flaming arrow

15:18.687 --> 15:22.164
at my dead body on a boat
and just... "Fzzt!"

15:22.166 --> 15:23.503
Rizzoli bonfire.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.875
Can't wait.

15:24.877 --> 15:26.848
That's not really
how Norse funerals are done.

15:27.888 --> 15:29.057
Party pooper.

15:30.531 --> 15:31.901
Fine. Is that it?

15:31.903 --> 15:33.641
Uh, forensically speaking, yes.

15:33.643 --> 15:36.384
But I do have something else
you might be able to use.

15:36.386 --> 15:37.372
Oh?

15:37.858 --> 15:40.198
The fact that the victim
was a funeral director

15:40.200 --> 15:43.109
reminded me of a case
that came in from Essex County

15:43.111 --> 15:44.715
about six weeks ago.

15:44.717 --> 15:48.026
The victim was stabbed to death
and thrown into a grave.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.100
And it turns out that the grave was dug

15:50.102 --> 15:52.961
for a casket from Mason's Funeral Home.

15:52.963 --> 15:55.455
Stranger still, the body was embalmed.

15:56.483 --> 15:58.027
Wait... Aren't <i> all</i> bodies embalmed?

15:58.029 --> 16:00.428
No, uh, not the deceased person
in the casket,

16:00.430 --> 16:02.435
but the murder victim in the dirt.

16:03.489 --> 16:05.912
Huh. That's a twist.

16:06.450 --> 16:08.750
Can you tell if the same person
embalmed both bodies?

16:08.752 --> 16:12.138
Well, the technique used
for both bodies was the same,

16:12.140 --> 16:13.487
so in my opinion, yes.

16:13.489 --> 16:16.677
Would you say said person was Sam Mason?

16:17.108 --> 16:18.586
I might, if I could see records

16:18.588 --> 16:21.101
of his most recent work for comparison.

16:21.516 --> 16:22.500
Done.

16:22.502 --> 16:24.802
Ooh. How'd it go at the clinic?

16:24.804 --> 16:28.192
Uh, a family prayed for me
to help their baby.

16:28.850 --> 16:30.369
Is that a bad thing?

16:31.307 --> 16:32.393
It's a very grim case,

16:32.396 --> 16:34.618
so I just don't see
what good it could do.

16:35.224 --> 16:38.086
Well, that's between them
and whomever they're praying to.

16:38.088 --> 16:39.938
I'm a doctor, so I don't believe...

16:39.940 --> 16:42.194
I know, but...

16:42.196 --> 16:43.542
Can't hurt, can it?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.791
I've been dealing
with Essex County homicide.

16:57.793 --> 16:59.812
Their murder is still unsolved.

16:59.814 --> 17:02.068
Did they give you
any information you can use?

17:02.070 --> 17:05.098
Ben Norton... he's 22, unemployed,

17:05.101 --> 17:08.232
lived in Roxbury with two roommates.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.500
Did he know our victim?

17:09.782 --> 17:11.195
Not that I can confirm.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.386
But he and Kate Mason
attended the same college

17:13.387 --> 17:14.732
in Fairfield, Connecticut.

17:15.644 --> 17:16.922
Doesn't mean they know each other.

17:16.924 --> 17:18.134
They <i> might</i> have.

17:18.136 --> 17:21.704
Okay, so, Kate Mason knows Ben Norton

17:21.705 --> 17:23.556
and kills him for some reason.

17:23.558 --> 17:28.000
She then asks her brother
to help her dispose of his body?

17:28.645 --> 17:31.438
Sam Mason embalms the body
to buy time and then ditches it

17:31.440 --> 17:33.646
when the next funeral comes their way?
But then what?

17:33.648 --> 17:35.816
He just freaks out
and wants to sell the business

17:35.818 --> 17:37.500
so he can get away from his sister?

17:37.502 --> 17:39.611
Could be, but she finds out
about it and gets rid of <i> him.</i>

17:40.029 --> 17:41.811
But she can embalm people herself.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.394
Why rope her brother into it?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.855
Guess we're gonna have to ask <i> her.</i>

17:47.008 --> 17:48.243
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:48.246 --> 17:49.794
I don't know this person.

17:49.796 --> 17:52.016
You didn't cross paths with
Ben Norton at Fairfield College?

17:52.018 --> 17:53.207
Not that I'm aware of.

17:53.209 --> 17:55.317
Yet, you know that his body
was buried in a grave

17:55.319 --> 17:57.126
that was dug for one
of your clients, correct?

17:57.811 --> 18:00.133
I knew that a body
had been found in Essex County,

18:00.135 --> 18:01.783
that there was an investigation.

18:01.785 --> 18:03.756
Okay, but you didn't
mention that when we spoke.

18:04.143 --> 18:05.686
My brother just died.

18:06.096 --> 18:07.501
I was thinking about <i> him.</i>

18:08.151 --> 18:10.315
That thing in Essex
never even occurred to me.

18:10.317 --> 18:12.047
But you see the coincidence, right?

18:13.415 --> 18:15.145
This victim died of stab wounds.

18:15.147 --> 18:16.444
Your brother was stabbed.

18:16.446 --> 18:18.143
Both bodies were found in graves

18:18.145 --> 18:19.908
for clients of your funeral home.

18:19.910 --> 18:22.006
Yes. I guess.

18:23.075 --> 18:25.672
Who inherits Sam's share of the
business now that he's gone?

18:26.073 --> 18:28.403
Our parents are dead. I guess <i> I</i> do.

18:28.405 --> 18:30.868
So I guess it's good that
the sale didn't go through, huh?

18:30.870 --> 18:32.100
What sale?

18:32.102 --> 18:34.132
Sam had an offer from Hilldale Holdings

18:34.134 --> 18:35.464
to buy the mortuary.

18:35.466 --> 18:36.835
The woman you saw him with was a broker.

18:36.837 --> 18:39.478
Sam would never sell me out.
We were partners.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.095
What do I have to do to
convince you I didn't do this?

18:44.097 --> 18:45.801
You can help us solve this thing.

18:45.803 --> 18:47.741
We would like the information
on every body

18:47.743 --> 18:49.681
that you and your brother embalmed.

18:49.683 --> 18:50.551
Fine.

18:55.035 --> 18:56.821
Am I gonna need a lawyer or something?

18:57.343 --> 18:58.393
That's up to <i> you.</i>

18:58.849 --> 19:00.758
Do you have something you feel
like you'd like to hide?

19:11.632 --> 19:12.373
Hey.

19:12.864 --> 19:14.701
The funeral home sent over their files.

19:14.703 --> 19:17.712
I, uh, just left them on your desk.

19:17.714 --> 19:18.508
Thank you.

19:20.357 --> 19:21.356
How's the baby?

19:21.662 --> 19:23.399
The clinic called.

19:23.401 --> 19:25.306
Her breathing has become erratic.

19:26.645 --> 19:28.565
Yeah, well,
that's to be expected, isn't it?

19:29.054 --> 19:30.571
Yes, unfortunately.

19:31.597 --> 19:34.203
You know, I've read every
pediatric journal in print,

19:34.205 --> 19:35.856
and I can't find anything to help her.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.219
I know.

19:40.896 --> 19:44.406
I know empirically
that there's nothing I can do,

19:44.408 --> 19:45.624
but...

19:46.650 --> 19:48.728
I just can't stop feeling responsible.

19:52.068 --> 19:53.505
I'm sorry, Maura.

19:55.782 --> 19:56.900
Me too.

20:04.618 --> 20:05.385
Yeah!

20:05.515 --> 20:08.223
Aw! Beat me again!

20:08.225 --> 20:10.163
This kid's like a shark!

20:11.168 --> 20:14.378
So, when do I get to meet Ron,
the handsome cardiologist?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.586
Oh, whenever you want. He's around.

20:16.588 --> 20:19.046
You really reinvented yourself, huh?

20:19.048 --> 20:20.509
Well, so did you.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.306
Plumbers' union... That's a big deal.

20:23.770 --> 20:25.896
I'm happy you finished your training.

20:25.898 --> 20:28.125
Chicago's been good to us.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.828
Chicago's too far away.

20:30.554 --> 20:32.946
I needed to get away.
I felt smothered here.

20:32.948 --> 20:34.077
By who? By me?

20:34.079 --> 20:34.933
No.

20:34.998 --> 20:38.773
You know, I just had to be
on my own, grow up.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.398
Well, you grew up.

20:41.099 --> 20:42.360
I'm proud of you.

20:42.526 --> 20:43.673
Thanks, Ma.

20:44.255 --> 20:46.614
Now it's T.J.'s time to grow up.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.808
Yeah, he's growing up so fast,
he's giving me whiplash.

20:48.810 --> 20:49.973
Aren't you?

20:49.975 --> 20:51.293
And he's gonna beat you again.

20:51.295 --> 20:52.510
Oh!

20:53.366 --> 20:57.395
You know, if you move back,
I could help you with T.J.

20:57.397 --> 20:59.254
No smothering.

21:00.349 --> 21:01.645
I don't know, Ma.

21:01.647 --> 21:03.041
I'm just putting it out there.

21:03.043 --> 21:05.951
I mean, it's your decision,
and I'll respect it.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.356
You want to stay here with Grandma?

21:09.559 --> 21:10.455
Yes.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.241
Oh, no! You beat her again!

21:12.355 --> 21:14.980
Really?! Are you kidding me?!

21:18.672 --> 21:21.477
All right. So, two D's.

21:22.065 --> 21:23.740
Okay. And last name...

21:27.266 --> 21:28.640
What are you doing?

21:28.642 --> 21:31.022
The FBI called me
for a background check.

21:32.132 --> 21:33.471
I'll have to call you back.

21:33.473 --> 21:34.680
I was gonna tell you.

21:34.682 --> 21:36.021
It's okay. I understand.

21:36.024 --> 21:38.046
You wanted to wait
till everything was final.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.391
But, you know, I realized
that after you leave,

21:41.393 --> 21:42.900
I'm not gonna be able to come in here

21:42.902 --> 21:44.561
and hug you whenever I want.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.599
You <i> never</i> come in here
and hug me whenever you want.

21:47.601 --> 21:49.276
Until now.

21:49.278 --> 21:50.552
What? Oh, God. No!

21:50.554 --> 21:52.163
What... Just... What did Maura say?

21:52.996 --> 21:54.578
Well, she ruled out the sister.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.686
Based on what?

21:55.688 --> 21:56.888
The sister was left-handed.

21:57.264 --> 21:59.624
That means she had a completely
different embalming technique.

21:59.882 --> 22:02.767
Sam did the embalming. They're positive.

22:02.769 --> 22:04.612
- She was telling the truth.
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.525
I cross-referenced
the funeral home records

22:06.527 --> 22:07.966
with those from local cemeteries.

22:07.968 --> 22:09.209
There are some gaps.

22:09.211 --> 22:11.021
"Omissions" are probably more accurate.

22:11.023 --> 22:13.504
These are cemetery records...
burials of caskets

22:13.506 --> 22:15.249
that came from Mason's Funeral Home.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.885
But some of them don't exist
in Mason's files.

22:18.238 --> 22:19.777
Somebody's scrubbing the books.

22:20.418 --> 22:23.231
To make it look like
these funerals never happened?

22:23.848 --> 22:24.852
Yeah.

22:24.854 --> 22:27.195
I'll get a ground-penetrating
radar team out to the cemeteries

22:27.197 --> 22:29.307
whose records don't line up
with Mason's.

22:30.552 --> 22:31.993
Hey, is Smitty in today? It's Korsak.

22:32.055 --> 22:33.551
Do not hug me.

22:38.807 --> 22:40.538
Nice day for an exhumation.

22:41.156 --> 22:42.773
This a recent Mason's funeral?

22:43.666 --> 22:45.786
Well, according to the cemetery, yes.

22:45.788 --> 22:47.463
But according to the funeral home...

22:47.465 --> 22:48.339
It never happened.

22:48.673 --> 22:50.248
The burial was nine days ago.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.604
Our radar team got an anomalous reading.

22:52.968 --> 22:55.584
It looks like the corpse has two heads.

22:55.586 --> 22:57.608
I wonder if that's how
Frankie put it in the warrant.

22:58.398 --> 22:59.732
How are you doing, by the way?

23:00.485 --> 23:02.764
Well, we have another cemetery
to cover after this

23:02.766 --> 23:03.605
and the mausoleums.

23:03.607 --> 23:05.508
I meant about Jane leaving.

23:09.444 --> 23:12.093
I'm struggling, to be honest.

23:13.102 --> 23:14.342
I'm happy for her, of course,

23:14.344 --> 23:16.858
and I'm sure it's the right decision.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.044
But you don't want her to go.

23:19.544 --> 23:21.374
Is that very selfish of me?

23:22.095 --> 23:23.685
If it is, we're in the same boat.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.765
Detective, I'm ready.

23:38.328 --> 23:40.582
At least the poor girl
still has her clothes on.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.051
In all, we've found four bodies

23:51.053 --> 23:53.165
in other people's graves or caskets...

23:53.167 --> 23:54.977
Sam Mason, Ben Norton,

23:54.979 --> 23:57.124
now Greta Shaw and Anne Hart.

23:57.127 --> 23:59.071
So he's a serial killer?

23:59.074 --> 24:00.413
Well, if we go down that road,

24:00.415 --> 24:01.823
Ben Norton was probably his first kill.

24:01.825 --> 24:03.906
He was sloppy...
just dumped him in the dirt.

24:04.374 --> 24:06.423
Then the next two
were planned more carefully.

24:06.992 --> 24:08.870
He waited for a funeral to come along

24:08.872 --> 24:11.368
so he could put the victims'
bodies into the caskets.

24:11.865 --> 24:12.896
Decent theory.

24:14.019 --> 24:15.459
We know he was embalming them.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.184
Why do that?

24:17.273 --> 24:19.151
Well, he worked for the mob
or a hit man.

24:19.408 --> 24:20.950
How did he get mixed up in that?

24:20.952 --> 24:21.820
I don't know.

24:22.059 --> 24:23.517
But whether or not
he killed these people,

24:23.562 --> 24:25.063
I know he didn't then kill himself

24:25.065 --> 24:26.501
and jump naked into the casket.

24:26.874 --> 24:27.604
True.

24:29.173 --> 24:31.675
So, if we figure out
who killed Sam Mason,

24:31.677 --> 24:33.938
we might be able to find
who killed the other three.

24:41.329 --> 24:43.331
Hey. Hey.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.594
I heard about Jane's FBI decision.

24:46.306 --> 24:47.295
How are you doing?

24:47.788 --> 24:49.256
Okay.

24:49.412 --> 24:51.262
By which, you mean not okay at all?

24:51.883 --> 24:54.507
Well, denial's working
in my favor right now.

24:54.989 --> 24:56.604
It's hard to imagine her leaving.

24:58.162 --> 25:01.016
Can you picture this place
with only one Rizzoli in it?

25:01.402 --> 25:03.305
You're all the Rizzoli I need.

25:11.983 --> 25:13.985
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:15.712 --> 25:16.930
You know, it's been a while
since I've been

25:16.932 --> 25:19.515
up this close and personal
with an embalmed body.

25:20.472 --> 25:23.453
You <i> can</i> hear yourself
when you speak, correct?

25:23.845 --> 25:25.814
I meant when I was at school, Jane.

25:25.816 --> 25:26.536
Oh.

25:26.918 --> 25:28.732
Spent a lot of time with old Gertrude.

25:29.022 --> 25:30.031
Gertrude?

25:30.033 --> 25:32.910
It's his medical cadaver,
not a weird girlfriend.

25:32.912 --> 25:35.032
- Mm-hmm.
- She was a great old gal.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.868
You know, she donated her body
to the university

25:36.870 --> 25:39.207
'cause she always wanted
to go to medical school.

25:39.209 --> 25:40.092
Mm.

25:40.644 --> 25:42.413
Think I've got a picture of her
somewhere around here.

25:42.415 --> 25:46.120
Okay, hi. Uh, can we talk about
<i>these</i> two bodies, please?

25:46.122 --> 25:46.936
Yes.

25:47.457 --> 25:49.726
So, we conducted side-by-side autopsies,

25:49.728 --> 25:53.701
and both bodies had stab wounds
on the upper-right abdomen.

25:53.703 --> 25:55.805
But the actual cause of death
was dry drowning.

25:56.128 --> 25:58.043
- Sounds painful.
- It is.

25:58.045 --> 26:01.685
The lungs become unable to
extract oxygen from the air...

26:01.853 --> 26:04.288
in this case, a result
from a puncture wound.

26:04.290 --> 26:07.327
So, the killer stabbed these two

26:07.329 --> 26:09.030
specifically to puncture their lungs?

26:09.032 --> 26:10.801
Yes, which is why it leads me to believe

26:10.803 --> 26:13.038
that Sam Mason is likely <i>not</i> the killer.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.244
Both women have multiple
stab marks on their abdomen,

26:16.246 --> 26:18.549
suggesting that the killer
made several attempts

26:18.551 --> 26:20.486
before finally piercing the lung.

26:20.488 --> 26:22.523
So he was guessing
about where to stab them.

26:22.525 --> 26:23.892
Or he didn't have the tools

26:23.894 --> 26:26.063
to fatally puncture the lung
on the first try.

26:26.065 --> 26:27.934
That doesn't sound like Sam Mason.

26:27.936 --> 26:30.773
Anatomical expertise
defines a mortician's work.

26:30.775 --> 26:32.577
Okay, so, if Sam didn't kill these two,

26:32.579 --> 26:33.745
why did he embalm them?

26:33.747 --> 26:35.950
I'm afraid they can't tell us that.

26:37.087 --> 26:39.156
Maybe he was in such a hurry
to sell because he knew

26:39.158 --> 26:41.427
that there were more
murdered victims headed his way.

26:41.429 --> 26:42.796
<i>That's</i> why he wanted out.

26:48.843 --> 26:51.479
Oh, you guys, I've missed this.

26:51.699 --> 26:54.318
Mmm. We're gonna have to
hang out as much as possible

26:54.320 --> 26:55.454
before you ship out.

26:55.456 --> 26:57.358
Okay, I'm not enlisting in the Army.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.040
You excited?

26:59.508 --> 27:00.369
I am.

27:00.859 --> 27:03.262
I am, but, I mean, you know,
leaving home is...

27:03.264 --> 27:05.071
It's hard. I get it.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.229
Now that Lydia's gone, I'm, uh...

27:08.011 --> 27:10.053
thinking about coming back here.

27:10.055 --> 27:11.670
Really? That'd be great!

27:12.197 --> 27:14.799
Yeah. Tommy, I-I-I could talk
to the professor.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.140
You... You could take over
the place for me here.

27:17.142 --> 27:18.524
I mean, Ma's just down the road.

27:18.526 --> 27:19.645
Well, it'd be nice for <i> something</i> good

27:19.647 --> 27:20.930
to come out of this whole thing.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.050
Mm-hmm.

27:22.052 --> 27:23.128
Mm.

27:24.305 --> 27:26.501
But I'm sorry it didn't work out
between you and Lydia.

27:26.502 --> 27:27.556
Eh, it's for the best.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.084
I mean, I think I'll just stick
to the dad thing,

27:30.317 --> 27:32.215
leave the husband stuff
to somebody else.

27:32.772 --> 27:34.824
All right. Well, don't,
you know, give up totally.

27:34.826 --> 27:36.809
I mean, you guys just weren't
right for each other, you know?

27:36.811 --> 27:39.719
Or maybe us Rizzolis
aren't cut out for marriage.

27:40.378 --> 27:41.722
Speak for yourself.

27:43.272 --> 27:44.844
I don't know. Ma might agree with him.

27:45.493 --> 27:47.308
Come on, Frankie. Look at us.

27:47.310 --> 27:49.578
Lone wolves. Runs in the family.

27:49.901 --> 27:51.447
It's not a genetic disorder.

27:51.449 --> 27:52.793
You just got to find the right person.

27:52.795 --> 27:54.240
All right. Take Korsak.

27:54.242 --> 27:56.192
He probably never thought
he'd get married again.

27:56.194 --> 27:58.372
But look at him now.
The guy's never been happier.

27:58.778 --> 27:59.819
You got a point.

27:59.844 --> 28:00.809
Thank you.

28:01.713 --> 28:02.720
You guys are loud!

28:02.722 --> 28:04.065
Oh! Sorry, T.J.

28:04.067 --> 28:05.008
I got it. I got it.

28:05.010 --> 28:08.440
Yes, we are! We are so loud!

28:08.442 --> 28:10.258
Hey, did I ever tell you the story

28:10.260 --> 28:12.060
about the little green man named Yoda?

28:12.062 --> 28:13.959
No. No?!

28:13.961 --> 28:15.608
Mm-hmm. Okay, come on. Let me tell you.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.603
Oh, you're gonna love this one.
It's awesome.

28:24.796 --> 28:26.679
Have you been here all night?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.438
Yeah.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.053
I just haven't been able to sleep.

28:31.055 --> 28:34.196
I've been, um, thinking about the baby.

28:34.757 --> 28:36.303
Were there any changes?

28:36.305 --> 28:39.063
Well, they said
her color improved a little bit

28:39.065 --> 28:42.067
after I had the nurse adjust
the fluids and electrolytes.

28:42.194 --> 28:43.563
Okay, well, that's something.

28:44.038 --> 28:44.958
Not enough.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.032
You now, in homicide,
the stakes are high,

28:50.034 --> 28:53.297
but...  not like this.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.569
I just...

28:58.414 --> 29:01.062
I don't know how
I'm gonna face her family today.

29:02.284 --> 29:03.896
Well, Maura, you may not
have the answer,

29:03.898 --> 29:06.391
but you're the perfect doctor
for that baby.

29:07.533 --> 29:08.602
How's that?

29:09.754 --> 29:11.232
Because the work that you're doing

29:11.234 --> 29:13.251
takes compassion and courage,

29:13.253 --> 29:15.242
and that's what that family
needs right now.

29:26.377 --> 29:28.223
What am I gonna do when you're not here?

29:28.867 --> 29:30.649
You'll pick up the phone.

29:30.674 --> 29:31.560
As will I.

29:32.165 --> 29:33.143
It's not the same.

29:33.276 --> 29:35.266
No, it's not.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.614
But we'll get through it,
like we always do.

29:39.306 --> 29:40.560
Together?

29:41.492 --> 29:42.899
I was gonna say "with wine."

29:45.524 --> 29:47.344
But...  yeah.

29:48.418 --> 29:49.439
Together.

29:55.413 --> 29:56.372
Hey.

29:56.826 --> 29:59.482
Still working on the connection
between our victims.

29:59.484 --> 30:01.367
Each of them disappeared
in the last few months,

30:01.369 --> 30:03.958
but there were no missing-persons
reports filed for any of them.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.977
Transients?

30:04.979 --> 30:07.424
Not homeless, but they did
move around a lot.

30:07.426 --> 30:09.073
So disappearing wouldn't be a red flag

30:09.075 --> 30:10.251
for people that knew them.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.336
Did they know each other?

30:12.654 --> 30:13.850
Not that I can tell.

30:14.293 --> 30:15.298
Looks like their cellphone records

30:15.300 --> 30:17.149
have exactly one number in common.

30:17.151 --> 30:18.738
I'm running the reverse trace now.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.288
Please be Sam Mason.

30:23.342 --> 30:25.024
They're models?

30:25.026 --> 30:27.378
If our killer targeted young,
attractive people in the area,

30:27.380 --> 30:29.533
a modeling agency
would be filled with victims.

30:29.535 --> 30:31.034
And we don't know who he is yet.

30:31.036 --> 30:32.836
So a lot of people are still in danger.

30:32.838 --> 30:33.704
I'll drive.

30:37.731 --> 30:40.074
My models mostly book print work...

30:40.379 --> 30:42.213
catalogs, brochures.

30:42.949 --> 30:45.817
They go to New York or L.A.
if they have higher aspirations.

30:45.819 --> 30:47.318
So it's normal for your clients

30:47.320 --> 30:48.720
to just disappear, like these three?

30:48.722 --> 30:51.456
Well, they stop checking in,
I assume they moved on.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.891
It happens every day.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.927
Is there any other information
that you can give us

30:54.929 --> 30:57.029
about these three...
something they had in common,

30:57.031 --> 30:59.832
a reason why someone might target them?

30:59.834 --> 31:03.002
Well, Ben booked
a high-end car campaign.

31:03.004 --> 31:04.503
Greta is my swimsuit girl.

31:04.505 --> 31:07.941
And Anne was a domestic diva...

31:07.943 --> 31:10.377
diapers, cleaning products,
that sort of thing.

31:10.379 --> 31:11.912
We're gonna need the information

31:11.914 --> 31:13.513
on all the meetings
and auditions you sent them on.

31:13.515 --> 31:15.181
Sure. Also an employee list...

31:15.183 --> 31:17.851
anyone they might have
crossed paths with here.

31:18.887 --> 31:21.416
I hate to think of my people in danger.

31:30.199 --> 31:31.302
Hello, everyone.

31:33.303 --> 31:34.503
How is she?

31:34.505 --> 31:36.705
Uh, they said that you ordered
more tests?

31:36.707 --> 31:38.640
Yes... hemoglobin and bilirubin.

31:38.642 --> 31:41.543
We need to monitor
how her condition is advancing.

31:43.213 --> 31:44.151
Sarah?

31:44.949 --> 31:45.882
Yes, Dr. Isles?

31:45.884 --> 31:47.583
When were these samples drawn?

31:47.585 --> 31:48.561
Last night.

31:49.387 --> 31:51.054
Do another blood draw.

31:51.056 --> 31:53.905
I also need a cortisol analysis
and another liter of fluid.

31:54.159 --> 31:55.925
And please call Dr. Harris
at the hospital.

31:55.927 --> 31:57.802
Tell him I'm bringing
a patient in immediately.

31:57.804 --> 31:58.583
Okay.

31:58.585 --> 31:59.908
W-What is it?

32:00.633 --> 32:03.500
Well, it's too... too soon to say,

32:03.502 --> 32:06.003
but seems to be some marked improvement

32:06.005 --> 32:07.237
in some crucial factors.

32:07.239 --> 32:09.473
It's happening. I'm sorry?

32:09.475 --> 32:10.807
You brought us our miracle.

32:11.545 --> 32:13.877
Everything all right, we have a miracle.

32:13.922 --> 32:15.922
_ We have a miracle here.

32:27.462 --> 32:29.302
Well, they're all gorgeous.
That's for sure.

32:29.878 --> 32:31.350
Think that's what got them killed?

32:32.233 --> 32:33.466
I don't know.

32:33.468 --> 32:35.634
The agency records...
That was a dead end?

32:35.636 --> 32:37.738
These three never intersected
on auditions

32:37.740 --> 32:39.423
or booked the same job.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.509
I was hoping for a shampoo commercial

32:42.511 --> 32:45.045
or a newspaper ad... something.

32:50.186 --> 32:51.186
Like that.

32:51.688 --> 32:54.443
Look... one, two, three.

32:54.924 --> 32:56.891
Are they all standing in the same place?

32:56.893 --> 32:57.597
Yeah.

32:58.228 --> 33:00.461
That's the farmers market
on Beacon Street.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.133
Well, so that must mean that
they used the same photographer.

33:04.135 --> 33:07.732
If that's true, they would have
paid him for these shots.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.572
Okay, let's go through
their bank accounts.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.172
He's got to be in there somewhere.

33:16.948 --> 33:19.783
I'm uncomfortable with this.
Eddie's a very private man.

33:19.785 --> 33:22.118
He's also a number-one suspect
in a murder investigation.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.054
Maybe we could just
wait for him to return?

33:24.056 --> 33:26.020
We'd prefer to do it <i>our</i> way.

33:51.552 --> 33:53.431
- Trophies.
- Yep.

33:54.229 --> 33:56.584
This guy's whole M.O. is a slow death.

33:56.858 --> 33:58.422
Plenty of time to take pictures.

33:59.094 --> 34:00.261
Jesus.

34:03.364 --> 34:05.804
His calendar says he's got
a shoot booked right now.

34:05.806 --> 34:08.346
Farmers market's
a couple blocks from here.

34:15.976 --> 34:18.518
Perfect. Now turn away from me
and look back.

34:21.197 --> 34:23.297
It's just, I have this mole.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.875
Very easy to touch that up.

34:25.877 --> 34:26.935
Really?

34:27.234 --> 34:28.791
Let's, uh, take these back
to the studio.

34:28.793 --> 34:30.244
I'll show you how I do it.

34:30.793 --> 34:31.958
Okay.

34:40.705 --> 34:42.228
Police!

34:45.745 --> 34:47.268
Out of the way! Out of the way!

34:47.271 --> 34:48.184
Out of the way!

34:48.186 --> 34:49.812
Move, move, move, move!

34:59.443 --> 35:01.237
- You got him?
- Yeah.

35:01.239 --> 35:01.998
Get up.

35:02.596 --> 35:03.495
Get up!

35:04.359 --> 35:06.303
You know you're gonna miss
this part, right?

35:08.427 --> 35:09.409
Yeah.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.092
Yeah, I am.

35:13.313 --> 35:15.162
We've known Eddie for years.

35:15.164 --> 35:18.507
His parents were killed in
a car accident when he was 16.

35:18.509 --> 35:20.878
Sam looked out for him after that.

35:21.969 --> 35:23.550
Sounds like
your brother had a big heart.

35:27.145 --> 35:28.800
In his confession,

35:28.835 --> 35:31.105
did Eddie say
why Sam embalmed those victims,

35:31.107 --> 35:33.104
why he didn't go to the police?

35:34.192 --> 35:35.512
Because of you.

35:36.244 --> 35:36.969
Me?

35:36.972 --> 35:39.207
Eddie had told Sam
that if he stopped helping him

35:39.209 --> 35:40.632
or if he went to the authorities,

35:40.634 --> 35:42.742
then he would come after you.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.395
He was trying to protect me.

35:45.397 --> 35:47.953
Yeah. Your brother loved you very much.

35:47.955 --> 35:50.034
I guess that's the most important thing

35:50.036 --> 35:51.831
to hang on to right now.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.698
Thank you, Detective.

35:54.700 --> 35:55.726
Sure.

36:05.102 --> 36:07.516
Hey. You got my text.

36:07.518 --> 36:08.657
Yeah.

36:08.962 --> 36:10.738
I wasn't sure you actually used that.

36:10.740 --> 36:11.914
All the time.

36:12.350 --> 36:14.865
I got this app on my phone
that tells me what's overhead,

36:15.078 --> 36:17.917
and then I just use my handy telescope

36:18.173 --> 36:19.444
to find it for myself.

36:20.034 --> 36:21.878
What are we looking at tonight?

36:21.880 --> 36:24.392
Uh, Cassiopeia.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.747
Ah, the African queen.

36:28.121 --> 36:29.705
Famously beautiful.

36:30.491 --> 36:33.551
But Poseidon banished her
into the sky for her vanity.

36:35.974 --> 36:39.730
Seems like there's worse
punishments than being up there.

36:39.732 --> 36:41.541
Oh, yeah. You're right.

36:41.543 --> 36:43.622
Prometheus gets his liver
pecked out by a bird

36:43.624 --> 36:46.240
every day for all of time.

36:46.242 --> 36:47.246
Yeesh.

36:48.892 --> 36:50.581
How do you know all that?

36:51.375 --> 36:52.745
I like myths.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.550
Yeah?

36:53.552 --> 36:55.300
- They're epic, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

36:55.302 --> 36:57.783
It's all passion and romance

36:57.785 --> 37:01.775
and love that spans eternity.

37:05.401 --> 37:06.682
This is great.

37:07.515 --> 37:08.934
It's perfect.

37:09.852 --> 37:10.964
I agree.

37:15.135 --> 37:16.415
Do you?

37:18.162 --> 37:21.132
'Cause right now, looking at you
under the stars...

37:22.618 --> 37:25.825
I think the Greeks had it right.

37:26.904 --> 37:28.149
What, about liver pecking?

37:28.151 --> 37:30.377
About eternity.

37:31.864 --> 37:33.014
I...

37:34.259 --> 37:36.484
I want us to be like this forever.

37:38.949 --> 37:40.319
Nina Holiday...

37:43.604 --> 37:44.917
...  will you marry me?

37:45.748 --> 37:46.876
Yeah!

37:46.878 --> 37:47.719
Yeah?

37:47.721 --> 37:49.069
Yeah.

37:49.071 --> 37:50.114
Yeah?

38:00.913 --> 38:03.947
â™ª I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and
drift away â™ª I forgot the rolls.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.983
- I got the rolls.
- Okay.

38:05.985 --> 38:07.650
Okay, I need another beer.

38:07.652 --> 38:08.718
I got it.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.653
Who gave him sugar? Ma?

38:10.655 --> 38:12.220
I gave him some juice.

38:12.222 --> 38:13.288
What kind of juice?

38:13.290 --> 38:15.289
A...  Popsicle.

38:15.695 --> 38:16.691
A Popsicle?

38:16.693 --> 38:19.259
Ma, you can't give him
a Popsicle for dinner!

38:19.261 --> 38:21.728
Look, there need to be some ground rules

38:21.730 --> 38:23.829
if we're gonna be living here.

38:23.831 --> 38:25.664
You mean it?

38:25.933 --> 38:27.532
Yeah, the professor said yes.

38:27.876 --> 38:30.801
So, my daughter is gonna be
out of harm's way.

38:30.803 --> 38:34.371
My grandson will be living
right next door.

38:34.373 --> 38:36.872
Wow. It's a gift from Heaven.

38:36.874 --> 38:38.174
What about your son?

38:38.176 --> 38:39.808
Yeah, what about your <i> other</i> son?

38:39.810 --> 38:41.176
Yeah, we're gifts from Heaven,
too, right, Ma?

38:41.178 --> 38:43.143
Yeah, yeah.
Shut it and eat your bucatini.

38:47.749 --> 38:48.848
You okay?

38:49.884 --> 38:51.616
Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry.

38:51.618 --> 38:54.018
I'm just distracted.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.354
The baby's improving, right?

38:56.356 --> 38:58.088
Yes... on every level.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.262
And her labs are almost normal.

39:00.892 --> 39:03.892
Most people would say that with a smile.

39:03.894 --> 39:05.094
I know. I know.

39:05.096 --> 39:06.994
But it just doesn't make sense,

39:06.996 --> 39:09.197
and I'm having a hard time accepting it.

39:12.334 --> 39:13.313
Okay.

39:13.835 --> 39:14.900
Come with me.

39:15.536 --> 39:16.502
Where are we going?

39:16.504 --> 39:18.670
Just a place I like to think.

39:18.672 --> 39:20.972
Uh, we'll be right back. Okay?

39:20.974 --> 39:23.307
Uh, Ma, we'll be right back.
We'll be right back.

39:23.309 --> 39:26.008
Oh, yeah. Crouton hoops. Hit me. Hit me.

39:26.010 --> 39:26.843
One.

39:26.845 --> 39:28.644
Ohh! Yeah! Ohh!

39:29.913 --> 39:31.012
That was amazing!

39:31.014 --> 39:32.381
Okay, cut it out. Cut it out.

39:32.383 --> 39:34.815
Don't let him...
Don't show him that. Come on!

39:34.817 --> 39:36.783
Teri, bring me the broom.

39:39.187 --> 39:41.854
I know I should just be happy, and I <i> am.</i>

39:41.856 --> 39:44.089
Ana is gonna live
a long and healthy life.

39:44.091 --> 39:47.525
It's just... It bothers me
that I can't explain it.

39:48.044 --> 39:50.059
You know, Maura, some things
don't have an explanation.

39:50.366 --> 39:51.461
Yeah, but the science was indisputable.

39:51.463 --> 39:53.529
There was no reason
to expect an improvement,

39:53.531 --> 39:54.597
much less a recovery.

39:54.599 --> 39:56.051
And yet it happened.

39:57.050 --> 39:59.166
Well, I'm not gonna say
it was a miracle.

40:01.928 --> 40:03.869
Sometimes, I like to play a game...

40:03.872 --> 40:05.438
"What if it didn't happen?"

40:05.874 --> 40:08.874
For example, what if
my apartment didn't burn down?

40:10.159 --> 40:11.809
Then you wouldn't have moved
into the professor's townhouse.

40:11.811 --> 40:13.377
Exactly.

40:13.379 --> 40:16.679
And then Tommy and T.J.
wouldn't have a place to live

40:16.681 --> 40:17.947
that's close to Ma.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.332
I like this. Do another one.

40:20.981 --> 40:23.051
Okay, um...

40:24.452 --> 40:26.287
What if you didn't have
your brain injury?

40:29.267 --> 40:31.090
If I hadn't gotten hurt,

40:31.092 --> 40:34.693
then maybe I wouldn't have
pursued other experiences,

40:34.695 --> 40:36.361
like working at the clinic.

40:36.641 --> 40:39.163
And that baby wouldn't
have had you there.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.765
So, everything happens for a reason?

40:41.945 --> 40:43.782
Whether we can explain it or not.

40:44.869 --> 40:47.969
We're all... part of a bigger plan.

40:50.006 --> 40:52.139
It's a very unscientific explanation.

40:52.141 --> 40:53.808
Maybe.

40:53.810 --> 40:57.210
But it... helps me get through things.

40:59.019 --> 41:00.112
Like leaving home?

41:00.114 --> 41:01.227
Yeah.

41:02.482 --> 41:03.815
I'm gonna need more science

41:03.817 --> 41:05.716
to make myself feel better about that.

41:05.718 --> 41:07.184
Okay...

41:08.281 --> 41:09.718
Yeah, no. I got nothing.

41:13.324 --> 41:15.689
Well, I'm still not gonna say
it was a miracle.
