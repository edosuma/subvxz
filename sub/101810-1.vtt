02:11.338 --> 02:17.278
<i>People would rather live in
homes regardless of its grayness.</i>

02:42.569 --> 02:45.706
<i>If we walk far enough,
says Dorothy,</i>

02:50.111 --> 02:53.682
<i>we shall sometime
come to someplace.</i>

05:14.188 --> 05:17.158
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!

05:18.592 --> 05:20.695
I thought you
took him to school.

05:20.727 --> 05:22.329
Yes. That was this morning.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.666
- What time is it now?
- Like 4:30.

05:25.698 --> 05:27.335
- It's late.
- Yeah.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.403
We'll be leaving in
a couple of minutes.

05:29.436 --> 05:32.106
- I need to talk to Cody for a minute.
- Sure.

05:34.340 --> 05:38.512
Cody. What I'm about to
tell you is very important.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.349
Mommy, are you mad at me?

05:43.851 --> 05:47.355
No, baby, I'm not mad at you.

05:47.387 --> 05:50.491
I just want you to pay
close attention to me, okay?

05:51.791 --> 05:55.262
Only mommy is inside your heart.

05:55.296 --> 05:58.832
And only Cody
is inside Mommy's heart.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.669
No one else. Okay?

06:01.702 --> 06:03.803
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.902
Hello?

06:35.936 --> 06:38.306
She's out all day. Nobody knows where
she goes. Why would she have herself...

06:39.505 --> 06:41.375
I'm home.

06:42.508 --> 06:43.944
Honey, we're in here.

06:49.416 --> 06:51.286
Why are you all
sitting in the dark?

06:52.352 --> 06:53.920
Hi.

06:53.953 --> 06:58.425
- Did you have a good day?
- Busy.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.861
Kiss.

07:10.436 --> 07:15.909
Are you going to say hello,
or are we invisible to you?

07:19.012 --> 07:20.548
Hello, mother.

07:21.548 --> 07:23.351
And Carmen?

07:27.287 --> 07:30.490
- Hello, Carmen.
- Hi.

07:31.424 --> 07:34.628
I'm happy to see you've
taken your camera with you.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.597
Did you get some good shots?

07:38.299 --> 07:41.669
- Yes, I think so.
- Yeah? Great.

07:45.638 --> 07:50.377
Pizza? It's so unhealthy.

07:50.411 --> 07:52.747
It's so greasy.

07:52.779 --> 07:54.881
We didn't know
what time you'd be back.

07:56.517 --> 08:00.621
- So we just ordered.
- Yeah. It's actually pretty good.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.023
I can warm you up a slice.

08:03.424 --> 08:04.892
No, thank you.

08:04.924 --> 08:07.961
How about a sandwich?
Take me two minutes.

08:07.995 --> 08:09.897
No, that's okay.

08:11.998 --> 08:15.402
- Have you eaten today?
- Yes. I stopped and had a salad.

08:26.347 --> 08:28.015
Where have you been?

08:29.916 --> 08:31.652
Out.

08:33.754 --> 08:35.489
Out?

08:35.521 --> 08:38.092
What is that supposed to mean?

08:38.125 --> 08:40.461
Your cell phone
is always turned off.

08:40.494 --> 08:43.665
No one knows where
you are or where you're going.

08:45.598 --> 08:49.703
So what? Now I have to report to you
where I'm going and what I'm doing?

08:49.736 --> 08:52.873
Not a report, it's courtesy.

08:53.973 --> 08:57.344
What on earth are you wearing?

09:04.050 --> 09:06.886
What are you wearing?
What do you mean?

09:06.919 --> 09:10.558
Where did you go?
What did you do?

09:18.598 --> 09:22.669
Shh! Shh! He's asleep.

09:22.702 --> 09:24.804
I can see that.

09:24.837 --> 09:26.373
Hmm.

09:32.545 --> 09:35.415
Where did you get
this <i>Wizard of Oz</i> book?

09:35.448 --> 09:40.121
It was in the bag you left on the
bench at the playground this afternoon.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.861
Really?

09:48.661 --> 09:50.097
Yeah.

09:59.872 --> 10:04.478
I think you are
wrong to want a heart.

10:05.511 --> 10:08.849
It makes most people unhappy.

10:10.683 --> 10:15.655
If you only knew it, you
are in luck not to have a heart.

10:29.903 --> 10:31.539
Why are you crying?

10:39.178 --> 10:40.981
Tell me what's wrong.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.621
Nothing. I'm fine.

10:54.595 --> 10:55.963
Kiss me.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.003
You don't want to kiss me?

11:04.203 --> 11:06.840
Goldie and
Carmen are downstairs.

11:08.174 --> 11:09.910
So what?

11:10.877 --> 11:13.680
Oh, God!
You never have time for me.

11:13.713 --> 11:16.816
You always have something to do.
There's always someone here.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.820
Don't you find that strange?

11:19.852 --> 11:21.621
We're never alone.

11:22.856 --> 11:26.928
And yet, I feel so deeply alone.

11:28.761 --> 11:32.866
I came home.
You weren't here.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.702
I asked Carmen to order pizza.

11:35.802 --> 11:39.507
- We opened a bottle of wine.
- Hmm.

11:39.539 --> 11:43.644
And waited.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.913
I don't understand
why you're making a big deal.

11:45.946 --> 11:51.151
Maybe you would understand
if I were to draft a legal brief

11:51.183 --> 11:56.723
explaining how violated and
trespassed I feel in my own home?

11:56.756 --> 11:58.659
What on Earth
are you talking about?

12:00.193 --> 12:04.832
Even when I speak in your lingo,
I don't make sense.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.537
So just forget it.
You don't understand me.

12:14.674 --> 12:17.911
No. I don't understand you.

12:25.952 --> 12:29.122
Why do you always say
the wrong thing to upset her?

12:29.155 --> 12:31.858
Every little thing
bothers her nowadays.

12:31.891 --> 12:34.160
Mother.

12:34.193 --> 12:37.865
- I need to ask you a favor.
- Yes?

12:37.898 --> 12:43.337
Never ever show up in my house
again, without calling first.

12:43.370 --> 12:45.039
Elyse?

12:47.140 --> 12:50.577
Carmen. Dear Carmen.

12:50.611 --> 12:55.616
You are never to have dinner
with my husband alone

12:55.649 --> 12:58.251
unless I invite you.

12:58.284 --> 13:00.286
Goldie invited me.

13:00.319 --> 13:03.690
- I don't give a fuck if Santa Claus invited you.
- Stop it!

13:03.723 --> 13:06.025
I get it.
I can respect house rules.

13:06.058 --> 13:07.861
You've made
yourself perfectly clear.

13:07.894 --> 13:11.932
You are way out of line,
talking to us in this manner.

13:11.965 --> 13:17.838
It's time you grow up and stop acting like a
spoiled, entitled, narcissistic little brat

13:17.871 --> 13:19.740
throwing tantrums for attention.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.980
Attention? Hah!

13:27.014 --> 13:28.749
Grow up.

13:31.751 --> 13:36.056
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

13:39.860 --> 13:41.662
What was that about?

13:41.694 --> 13:44.664
She's desperate
for attention, sweetheart.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.132
I think she needs help.

13:46.165 --> 13:48.401
It's true.

13:48.434 --> 13:52.138
One minute she's laughing,
dancing, singing.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.274
She tells me she loves me.

13:54.307 --> 13:56.076
The next minute, she hates me.

13:56.108 --> 13:59.012
She's crying,
off-the-wall angry.

13:59.045 --> 14:01.047
Has this look like
she wants to kill me.

14:04.985 --> 14:07.087
Fuck!

14:07.120 --> 14:09.657
- Elyse?
- I hate her!

14:12.759 --> 14:16.163
Honey?
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

14:16.196 --> 14:18.799
- What?
- Stop, stop, stop!

14:18.832 --> 14:22.001
- No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

14:22.034 --> 14:24.103
It's okay. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

14:24.136 --> 14:27.006
- Calm down.
- I hate her!

14:27.039 --> 14:32.145
She's done this
my whole fucking life.

14:32.178 --> 14:35.750
- I want to die.
- Shh! Shh!

14:44.323 --> 14:46.327
It's okay.

14:49.029 --> 14:54.802
Sweetheart, I think
you need to see a doctor.

14:56.068 --> 15:00.207
I have someone.
Michael recommended.

15:03.309 --> 15:06.779
You've been talking to people
in the office about me?

15:06.813 --> 15:08.749
I can't believe you.

15:08.781 --> 15:11.484
No, no, no. Not at all.

15:11.518 --> 15:14.888
- Michael's a friend.
- So what, he's your friend.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.457
I don't want you talking to
people in the office about me.

15:17.491 --> 15:19.425
This is our private life.

15:19.458 --> 15:24.298
Sweetheart,
you need to see a doctor.

15:24.331 --> 15:26.332
And you need to
get back on medication.

15:27.534 --> 15:30.236
No. No.

15:30.270 --> 15:35.042
I'm not seeing a doctor, and I'm
not getting back on medication.

15:35.074 --> 15:37.343
Why am I not allowed to have
feelings with...

15:37.376 --> 15:42.015
without being told there's
something wrong with me?

15:43.449 --> 15:47.253
Sweetheart,
Michael's doctor saved his life.

15:47.286 --> 15:49.322
His wife left him.

15:50.323 --> 15:52.358
She took their kids.

15:52.391 --> 15:54.895
He was almost disbarred.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.430
Now he's doing great.

15:58.465 --> 16:01.000
I don't give a shit
about Michael.

16:04.337 --> 16:09.043
Okay, I can see this
conversation is going nowhere.

16:10.510 --> 16:15.950
Hello? Hi, Brian.
Yes, this a good time.

16:16.949 --> 16:20.153
Yes.
We can do that.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.489
Sure.

16:23.490 --> 16:24.859
Mm-hmm.

16:25.991 --> 16:27.361
I think we can
wrap it up next week.

16:28.428 --> 16:30.230
I'll call you tomorrow.

16:30.263 --> 16:32.166
After lunch.

16:36.236 --> 16:40.039
Oh, give my love
to Laura and the kids.

16:40.073 --> 16:42.143
Yup, bye.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.057
Can we talk?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.161
What's so important?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.595
What have I done wrong?

17:02.629 --> 17:05.399
You make it pretty
obvious you don't like me.

17:05.431 --> 17:07.500
- Poor you.
- Oh, give me a break.

17:07.534 --> 17:10.403
Can't you just talk to me,
woman-to-woman?

17:10.437 --> 17:13.506
Unless, in your eyes I'm simply
the housekeeper's daughter.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.409
Not allowed to address you
directly,

17:15.441 --> 17:19.212
and always to be restricted
to the maid's quarters.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.482
If that's how you see me,
I can't continue living here.

17:23.617 --> 17:27.354
Always playing
the little victim.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.225
I'm not the victim, but I
do want know what's going on.

17:34.427 --> 17:37.598
You want to know
that the fuck is going on?

17:37.630 --> 17:40.100
Yes, I do.

17:40.132 --> 17:43.603
You're too God damned familiar
with my husband.

17:43.637 --> 17:46.340
You don't respect our space.

17:46.372 --> 17:51.944
Now I see.
Goldie was right.

17:51.977 --> 17:56.115
What bothers you is I work
at the firm with Steven.

17:56.149 --> 17:58.952
You got the job at the firm
because of me.

17:58.985 --> 18:04.058
Oh, okay. Well, how gracious of you.
Thank you.

18:06.059 --> 18:08.495
It's late. Goodnight.

18:13.233 --> 18:15.402
Carmen. Wait.

18:19.538 --> 18:26.079
The truth is I feel like
I'm slowly losing my mind.

18:28.180 --> 18:29.984
And I don't know
what to do about it.

18:32.084 --> 18:38.124
I can see the damage that I am
causing you and everyone in my life.

18:39.659 --> 18:41.462
I see your pain.

18:42.461 --> 18:44.097
I feel it.

18:44.997 --> 18:47.234
You know I'm here
for you and Steven.

18:49.201 --> 18:51.070
Yes, I know.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.379
So, Steven
recommended I see a doctor.

18:59.979 --> 19:05.118
He mentioned,
a Michael in your office.

19:06.052 --> 19:08.255
Yeah. Michael Davis.

19:08.287 --> 19:10.323
I don't know him that well,
but I heard he was in treatment

19:10.357 --> 19:13.360
for depression or addiction.
I don't know.

19:14.561 --> 19:16.597
I might go see this doctor.

19:18.732 --> 19:20.334
Good idea.

19:23.169 --> 19:24.403
Well, good night.

19:28.274 --> 19:29.642
Good night, Elyse.

19:47.293 --> 19:49.129
Sorry you're caught
in the middle of all this.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.199
It's painful to watch.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.469
I know.

19:58.537 --> 20:03.409
I know it's none of my business, and
perhaps I'm overstepping my boundaries, but

20:04.377 --> 20:07.748
I think Elyse is suffering
from something very serious.

20:09.615 --> 20:11.417
I agree.

20:11.450 --> 20:13.286
Do you think it would help
the situation if I move out?

20:14.219 --> 20:16.023
Give up my internship with you?

20:16.055 --> 20:18.558
I can go to another law firm.
I do have other options.

20:19.793 --> 20:23.464
No.
You're not going anywhere.

20:25.297 --> 20:27.733
You working at the
firm is not the problem.

20:27.766 --> 20:32.272
Maybe it is. Steven, please, listen to me.
You're a great husband.

20:33.372 --> 20:35.307
And you give her everything.
You work so hard.

20:35.341 --> 20:38.645
You have this beautiful
home, but no one's happy.

20:38.678 --> 20:40.113
It's tragic.

20:42.548 --> 20:44.617
You're absolutely right.

20:46.753 --> 20:53.193
This place is an empty
shell of vanished dreams.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.829
Don't say that.

20:55.861 --> 20:58.465
Elyse told me you
mentioned Michael Davis?

20:58.497 --> 21:01.234
And that you want
her to see his doctor?

21:01.266 --> 21:03.536
She said she wants to go.

21:03.570 --> 21:06.106
She knows something isn't right.

21:07.407 --> 21:08.542
She said that?

21:09.742 --> 21:11.445
Yeah, she did.

22:25.951 --> 22:28.654
Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

22:32.926 --> 22:35.729
<i>Buenas Noches</i> and good evening.

22:35.762 --> 22:39.366
With us on saxophone,
we have Oscar Lopez.

22:40.699 --> 22:42.535
I'll have one more.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.371
- And on Spanish guitar...
- One more coming up.

22:46.538 --> 22:49.375
- The first number of the evening is...
- Make it a double.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.178
<i>...Bésame mucho.</i>

22:51.210 --> 22:53.746
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure, make it a double.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.849
And I want a shot on the side.

22:58.685 --> 23:02.489
Mm. Mm.

23:03.656 --> 23:07.327
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Can't drink on the job.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.497
No.

23:11.531 --> 23:14.768
I bet you could
if you really wanted to.

23:18.470 --> 23:20.506
This one's on me.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.643
But I dare you to
go onstage and dance.

23:25.812 --> 23:27.647
- I love a dare.
- That's what I thought.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.252
Thank you.

24:34.980 --> 24:38.351
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24:39.651 --> 24:41.255
Oh.

24:42.322 --> 24:44.924
I just had a crazy dream.

24:44.957 --> 24:47.494
Oh.

24:47.526 --> 24:50.963
I was at a Latin night club.

24:52.064 --> 24:54.668
The place was packed.

24:54.700 --> 24:59.538
And I started
dancing through the crowd.

25:00.473 --> 25:03.710
Carmen was onstage singing.

25:05.812 --> 25:09.616
- Our Carmen?
- Yes.

25:09.649 --> 25:11.885
Your Carmen.

25:13.852 --> 25:15.755
I'm teasing.

25:21.593 --> 25:23.663
Why can't we go out?

25:25.130 --> 25:27.066
Have some fun?

25:28.133 --> 25:32.338
Go dance. Drink. Live it up.

25:34.707 --> 25:38.445
Sure. Why not?

25:40.513 --> 25:42.082
Why not?

25:43.749 --> 25:47.987
Can you believe, Carmen on stage?
Singing?

25:50.122 --> 25:51.725
In the dream?

25:52.958 --> 25:55.928
Yes. In the dream.

25:56.862 --> 25:59.765
I have to leave.
I'm running late.

26:00.832 --> 26:03.402
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

26:12.745 --> 26:16.448
- What time will you be back?
- Seven.

26:16.482 --> 26:20.387
- You'll call me from the office?
- I will.

26:42.975 --> 26:45.645
I love you, baby.

27:02.762 --> 27:04.765
They're claiming
they have a witness.

27:06.032 --> 27:08.534
Uh, let's wait and see.

27:11.204 --> 27:14.640
Okay. I'm drafting up the
papers this morning.

27:14.673 --> 27:17.410
I'll call you later to go
over the questions you have.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.882
Right. Okay.

29:40.018 --> 29:43.989
"California Bar Exam
Total Prep."

30:10.315 --> 30:15.053
Oh, here you are.
You barely touched your breakfast.

30:15.086 --> 30:16.255
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

30:20.659 --> 30:22.027
How was Cody
on the way to school?

30:23.428 --> 30:26.099
He seemed a little tired.

30:26.131 --> 30:27.366
Why?

30:28.700 --> 30:31.337
For some reason he
had a hard time falling asleep.

30:33.205 --> 30:34.374
Oh.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.326
So, tell me,
what can I do for you?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.161
Why are you here?

30:59.130 --> 31:02.935
- Escher. You have two Eschers.
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.967 --> 31:05.837
- Are they originals?
- No prints.

31:05.871 --> 31:08.174
Reproductions.

31:08.207 --> 31:11.044
- You like Escher?
- Oh, I love Escher.

31:11.076 --> 31:13.178
I love everything
about his work.

31:13.211 --> 31:16.715
So full of infinite mystery.

31:16.748 --> 31:18.418
Great artist.

31:18.450 --> 31:22.255
Huh. Pretty impressive,
isn't he?

31:22.287 --> 31:25.857
Hmm. I also love
Maxfield Parrish.

31:25.890 --> 31:27.293
Oh, yes.

31:28.226 --> 31:30.929
What is it you love
about Maxfield Parrish?

31:33.364 --> 31:35.401
His blue skies.

31:36.468 --> 31:40.239
What do you
associate with his blue skies?

31:45.945 --> 31:47.280
Childhood.

31:53.084 --> 31:55.987
Excuse me.
I hate crying.

31:56.021 --> 31:59.092
It's so silly to cry.
So stupid.

32:00.458 --> 32:04.296
Oh, crying is
not silly or stupid.

32:04.330 --> 32:06.332
At least, I don't think it is.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.937
Who told you
that crying is stupid?

32:12.138 --> 32:13.773
My mother.

32:15.073 --> 32:17.476
- That's a beautiful tie.
- Thank you.

32:17.509 --> 32:20.345
I love that color, burgundy red.

32:20.379 --> 32:22.482
- Did your wife pick that out for you?
- Oh, yes.

32:22.515 --> 32:26.119
My wife picks
out all things for me.

32:26.151 --> 32:29.521
- What's your wife's name?
- Harriet.

32:29.554 --> 32:32.390
It's a beautiful name. Hmm.

32:32.423 --> 32:36.862
Don't you think it's lovely that
wives like to shop for their husbands?

32:36.896 --> 32:41.868
I mean, I buy all of Steven's clothes.
Shirts, ties, underwear.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.268
Everything.

32:45.970 --> 32:51.877
So, tell me, why are you here?

32:51.910 --> 32:53.178
How can I help you?

32:54.746 --> 32:58.884
What can I tell you that you haven't
already heard from my mother or husband?

32:58.918 --> 33:01.320
Oh, I don't know.
I thought, um...

33:04.590 --> 33:07.861
perhaps it would be better
to hear it from you.

33:21.172 --> 33:22.541
Hello?

33:26.245 --> 33:28.380
Sorry, did you
just say something?

33:28.413 --> 33:32.884
I asked why you came to see me.

33:32.918 --> 33:34.954
How can I help you?

33:38.957 --> 33:41.494
Doctor Lewis, something
tells me you're really sharp.

33:41.526 --> 33:43.328
Well, thank you.

33:43.361 --> 33:45.464
I think you're
pretty sharp yourself.

33:54.038 --> 33:57.242
People's
possessions are fascinating.

33:57.275 --> 33:59.946
Everything we collect
tells a story.

33:59.978 --> 34:03.248
The places we've been
and the people we've met.

34:09.521 --> 34:12.592
What is this? A ladybug?

34:12.624 --> 34:19.198
No, it's a beetle. It's the same family
as a ladybug, but that's a scarab beetle.

34:23.035 --> 34:24.938
Jung's window.

34:26.171 --> 34:29.275
- Who?
- Doctor Carl Jung?

34:29.307 --> 34:32.177
The intellectual lady and
her dream of the golden scarab?

34:32.211 --> 34:37.116
- Ah, so you know the story?
- Yes, I do. - Yeah.

34:37.148 --> 34:39.417
Jung and synchronicity.

34:39.450 --> 34:43.622
- Do you believe in synchronicity?
- No.

34:44.622 --> 34:46.492
Absolutely not.

34:46.525 --> 34:48.461
"Absolutely not."

34:50.262 --> 34:53.298
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

34:54.332 --> 34:56.269
You're pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

34:57.202 --> 34:58.438
You think so?

34:59.604 --> 35:03.441
- Are you a Jungian or a Freudian?
- Oh, I don't know.

35:03.474 --> 35:07.313
I'm just a... just a
working doctor, that's all.

35:09.548 --> 35:12.151
And your wife
chooses your ties for you.

35:12.184 --> 35:13.952
Yeah.

35:14.686 --> 35:16.154
How quaint.

35:19.525 --> 35:22.160
Your mother told me
that you were a photographer.

35:22.193 --> 35:23.929
Hmm.

35:25.597 --> 35:28.568
- Hmm.
- Is that a yes or a no?

35:31.369 --> 35:32.938
Yes, I guess I am.

35:32.972 --> 35:34.340
Oh, good.

35:35.573 --> 35:38.278
What are your favorite subjects?

35:45.985 --> 35:49.055
Oh, I used to enjoy black-and-white
landscape photography.

35:49.088 --> 35:51.224
Hmm. And no more?

35:53.092 --> 35:55.628
Lately not much inspires me.

35:56.561 --> 35:59.231
The world
looks so dull and gray.

36:01.166 --> 36:04.336
I started carrying
my camera around.

36:04.369 --> 36:08.273
I carry it because it
makes my husband happy.

36:08.307 --> 36:12.011
So, tell me, how are
you feeling right now?

36:13.678 --> 36:17.115
What do you mean how do I feel?
I'm fine.

36:22.121 --> 36:24.023
Tell me about your father.

36:26.258 --> 36:29.729
I didn't know him.
I was a baby when he died.

36:29.762 --> 36:33.532
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
Your mother never told me that.

36:33.564 --> 36:36.601
I'm not surprised.
She only talks about herself.

36:36.635 --> 36:40.238
Hmm. Well, you know, perhaps
she forgot to mention it.

36:42.608 --> 36:46.711
Hmm. Tell me a little bit
about your mother.

36:46.744 --> 36:50.148
- She's a lying bitch.
- Oh.

36:50.182 --> 36:52.418
What sort of lies
does she tell you?

36:52.450 --> 36:54.686
Everything in her life is a lie.

36:54.720 --> 37:00.192
She lives a fabricated life.
A fairy tale. Embellished reality.

37:00.224 --> 37:03.228
- I see.
- And you know what she told me once?

37:03.262 --> 37:05.765
She told me my father
was so lucky to have died

37:05.798 --> 37:10.436
before he was able to see the
horrible, nasty person I'd become.

37:10.468 --> 37:12.037
Ah.

37:13.472 --> 37:15.775
How old were you
when she told you that?

37:16.675 --> 37:19.345
Eight, maybe nine.

37:19.378 --> 37:24.249
And then she told me I was
just like my father. Worthless.

37:24.282 --> 37:26.751
I laughed right in her face
when she said that.

37:26.785 --> 37:30.556
- And then when I was fourteen, I ran away from home.
- Mm-hmm.

37:30.588 --> 37:34.125
They caught me
and put me in juvenile hall.

37:34.159 --> 37:36.796
I didn't mind being locked up.

37:36.829 --> 37:39.064
It was better
than being with her.

37:41.233 --> 37:44.470
You know, I saw my father and my
grandmother when I was locked up?

37:44.503 --> 37:46.539
You saw your father
and your grandmother?

37:46.572 --> 37:49.075
I used to hear them at night
when the other girls were asleep.

37:49.108 --> 37:51.142
Ah, I see. Yes.

37:51.175 --> 37:54.479
It was all lies, what my
mother said about my father.

37:54.512 --> 37:57.582
My grandmother
told me the truth.

37:57.615 --> 38:01.253
He worked hard
in the business he built.

38:01.285 --> 38:05.825
He made a lot of money.
And mother loved that money.

38:05.858 --> 38:09.662
She loved that money
so much, she killed him.

38:09.695 --> 38:13.666
- She killed him?
- Yes, in a way.

38:13.698 --> 38:19.371
He had a heart attack, but see, she said...
she said his heart attacked him.

38:19.403 --> 38:24.774
Oh, it made me laugh when she said that.
"His heart attacked him."

38:25.144 --> 38:28.814
But you know, in a way,
it made sense.

38:28.847 --> 38:33.785
The heart, the wayward heart,
is just a wild animal,

38:33.818 --> 38:36.822
a beast that needs to be tamed.

38:38.256 --> 38:41.593
She warned me
that if I followed my heart,

38:41.626 --> 38:48.299
if I followed my wayward heart, if I followed
my dreams, then I would be killed too.

38:48.332 --> 38:51.403
- So I killed my own heart.
- Hmm.

38:51.436 --> 38:53.805
Oh, screw her, I thought.
Fuck you, lady.

38:53.838 --> 38:55.840
It's better that way.

38:55.874 --> 38:59.645
Heartless, dead, same thing.

38:59.677 --> 39:01.246
Yeah.

39:02.914 --> 39:04.583
Why the smile, doctor?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.220
I'm just listening.

39:08.186 --> 39:13.458
- And?
- Well, about, uh, your mother.

39:13.492 --> 39:18.397
People often say
things they really don't mean.

39:18.430 --> 39:22.301
She meant it.
You better believe she meant it.

39:23.936 --> 39:27.238
But you know, she's also
useful to me in her own way.

39:27.271 --> 39:28.907
How?

39:28.941 --> 39:31.776
Whatever she says, I use it
as reference to do the opposite.

39:31.809 --> 39:36.681
- Ah!
- And she thinks she's so smart.

39:39.450 --> 39:41.853
Doctor, are you
free this Saturday?

39:41.887 --> 39:45.658
It's my husband's birthday and I'm
hosting a dinner party for him.

39:45.691 --> 39:49.261
I would love for you to join.
Harriet too.

39:49.293 --> 39:52.630
Oh, thank you.
That's most gracious of you, Elyse.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.934
Unfortunately,
I'm not available this Saturday.

39:54.967 --> 39:57.302
Is your husband looking
forward to the dinner party?

39:58.436 --> 40:00.805
- Yes, I think he is.
- Ah.

40:00.838 --> 40:02.775
Anything to avoid
being alone with me.

40:02.807 --> 40:05.477
Why would he
avoid being alone with you?

40:06.477 --> 40:08.680
'Cause I think my
husband's afraid of me.

40:09.914 --> 40:11.617
Afraid of you, why?

40:13.318 --> 40:14.754
I don't know.

40:16.787 --> 40:18.356
Yeah.

40:20.392 --> 40:23.428
I'm going to make
a suggestion, Elyse.

40:24.595 --> 40:26.664
Just a recommendation.

40:26.697 --> 40:32.938
It may be a good idea for
you to arrange some date nights.

40:34.039 --> 40:35.807
Date nights with you?

40:35.840 --> 40:37.476
With your husband.

40:38.410 --> 40:40.980
- I'm just kidding.
- Yes, I know you are.

40:41.979 --> 40:44.483
Oh, you see, couples sometimes,

40:44.515 --> 40:47.919
you know,
they spend too much time apart

40:47.952 --> 40:53.858
and I think a date night is a way to
have fun and get to know each other.

40:53.892 --> 40:56.662
- Yeah. Yes. I think it's a good idea.
- Good.

40:56.695 --> 40:59.532
Do you go on
date nights with Harriet?

41:02.467 --> 41:04.336
Well...

41:04.369 --> 41:06.972
Okay, I think that's it.

41:07.005 --> 41:12.977
Wonderful session. So, next week I think your
husband's arranged with my assistant, um...

41:13.010 --> 41:14.947
I think
it's two sessions next week.

41:14.979 --> 41:18.784
I'm not surprised that he did.

41:18.816 --> 41:21.586
Thank you, Elyse.
Well done.

41:39.738 --> 41:43.042
- Hi, Elyse.
- Is my husband in his office?

41:43.075 --> 41:45.578
Yes, of course.
I'll tell him you're here.

41:47.412 --> 41:50.582
Hi, Jeff.
Yeah. Elyse is on her way up.

41:50.615 --> 41:52.551
Thanks, bye.

42:10.735 --> 42:12.537
Oh, hi.

42:14.972 --> 42:17.809
I saw that
that report that you...

42:17.843 --> 42:20.479
Oh, hi.
It's good to see you.

42:20.512 --> 42:23.649
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

42:23.682 --> 42:26.051
- Call me later?
- Okay.

42:26.084 --> 42:27.620
Great.

42:29.688 --> 42:31.990
I didn't know you
were coming by today.

42:32.023 --> 42:34.593
Well, I just had my
session with Doctor Lewis.

42:34.626 --> 42:38.530
His office is really close by.
It's just a few blocks away.

42:38.563 --> 42:40.131
I know.

42:40.164 --> 42:44.369
- How did it go?
- I like Doctor Lewis.

42:44.403 --> 42:47.939
I mean, he's intelligent,
handsome.

42:47.972 --> 42:50.007
We had a great session.

42:50.041 --> 42:52.044
What did you talk about?

42:53.577 --> 42:55.947
Lots of things.

42:55.981 --> 42:59.985
But, you know, there was none of
that New Age psychobabble nonsense.

43:00.017 --> 43:02.954
Your friend Michael
was absolutely right.

43:02.988 --> 43:06.925
That's great.
I'm glad you liked him.

43:06.957 --> 43:09.628
I told him about your
birthday dinner on Saturday.

43:09.660 --> 43:11.130
I invited him.
He said he might come.

43:12.898 --> 43:16.535
- You invited him?
- Yeah. Why not?

43:18.836 --> 43:21.472
I know you don't like parties.

43:21.506 --> 43:25.177
I told Doctor Lewis
about that and we both laughed.

43:29.046 --> 43:34.052
- Who else did you invite?
- Hmm. A few friends.

43:34.084 --> 43:37.490
My mother. Carmen.

43:39.858 --> 43:43.729
I'm keeping it simple.
Trust me, honey, it'll be fun.

43:43.762 --> 43:45.831
Doctor Lewis thinks
the party's a great idea.

43:45.863 --> 43:48.934
He wants us to find
time to celebrate life.

43:50.035 --> 43:55.707
Anyway, today's session was just about
getting the basics out of the way

43:55.740 --> 43:57.642
and getting acquainted.

43:58.876 --> 44:00.611
Great.

44:00.644 --> 44:03.648
- So you'll see him again?
- Hmm.

44:03.682 --> 44:06.084
I'm seeing him the
same time next week.

44:06.117 --> 44:08.120
- You made sure of that.
- Great.

44:09.553 --> 44:13.959
Sweetheart, I have an urgent
call to make in about a minute.

44:13.992 --> 44:15.660
So I'll see you later.

44:41.052 --> 44:45.524
- And you're going to go here.
- Mommy! Mommy!

44:47.726 --> 44:52.164
- Are you excited about Daddy's birthday?
- I am.

44:52.197 --> 44:53.899
It looks beautiful.

44:53.932 --> 44:55.700
What else did you do for Daddy?

44:55.733 --> 44:58.970
Um, I made daddy a picture.

44:59.003 --> 45:00.972
Show me.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.619
This is me.
That's daddy and that's you.

45:15.553 --> 45:19.291
- Why don't I have a smiley face, baby?
- I don't know.

45:19.323 --> 45:24.063
- Will you fix it?
- Yes. Yes, I could, Mommy.

45:29.633 --> 45:31.236
Thank you, baby.

45:36.206 --> 45:38.543
Yes. That's better.

45:44.349 --> 45:47.919
I see, so that's
what influenced the jury?

45:48.852 --> 45:50.889
Partially.

45:50.921 --> 45:54.726
But you can't always rely on the
testimony of a paid expert witness.

46:06.938 --> 46:11.010
Look at her. That's like her
fifth or sixth glass of champagne.

46:12.343 --> 46:15.548
If I don't bring that cake out,
it's going to be a fiasco.

46:16.314 --> 46:18.884
- See? - Yeah.
- She's clearly drunk.

46:18.916 --> 46:24.722
Yes, she is. I think you're
going to have to bring the cake in.

46:24.756 --> 46:26.659
Excuse me.

46:28.793 --> 46:33.332
- Wait.
- Oh. Oh, right. I forgot.

46:33.365 --> 46:35.568
You don't drink.

46:37.102 --> 46:42.041
Let me ask you something.
You know Doctor Lewis, right?

46:42.941 --> 46:45.811
Yes. I do.

46:45.843 --> 46:50.316
Steven told me that you're bipolar
and you drink to feel better.

46:52.082 --> 46:58.657
He said you almost lost your wife and
kids, but then Doctor Lewis saved your ass.

46:58.689 --> 47:00.291
I really wouldn't
like to talk about that.

47:00.325 --> 47:04.162
It's okay.
I met Doctor Lewis, too.

47:04.195 --> 47:08.667
I mean, I'm not bipolar or
alcoholic or anything like that

47:08.700 --> 47:12.037
though everyone thinks there's
something wrong with me.

47:14.271 --> 47:17.642
What do you think?
Do you see anything wrong with me?

47:19.010 --> 47:23.247
No. Not at all.

47:27.052 --> 47:31.624
Look at him.
He's so uptight.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.360
His own world.

47:37.195 --> 47:43.669
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Steven ♪</i>

47:43.702 --> 47:49.307
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

47:49.340 --> 47:51.309
Make a wish.

48:03.722 --> 48:05.858
Happy birthday.

48:07.057 --> 48:10.227
You fucking bitch.
You think I don't see what you're doing?

48:10.260 --> 48:12.396
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're a sick-ass drunk bitch.

48:12.430 --> 48:14.966
- Stop it! Stop it!
- I'm the sick fuck?

48:14.999 --> 48:17.302
You're in my house,
you stupid bitch!

48:17.334 --> 48:19.737
What the hell is wrong with you?
Elyse!

48:19.771 --> 48:24.243
Why in the hell did you throw a party,
if you're going to ruin it for everyone?

48:25.142 --> 48:28.079
- Fuck!
- Steven?

48:28.113 --> 48:29.782
Baby?

48:31.014 --> 48:36.854
I'm sorry, baby. Baby?
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

48:36.887 --> 48:41.427
Oh, God! Steven!

48:46.430 --> 48:52.970
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:53.003 --> 48:55.106
I'm sorry.

49:31.376 --> 49:33.378
Good morning, Elyse.

49:38.550 --> 49:40.818
Let me see those bruises.

49:44.956 --> 49:49.294
Okay, let me see your...
let me see your other one.

49:49.327 --> 49:52.063
Okay, okay, okay.

49:52.095 --> 49:54.265
I'm going to take
your blood pressure now.

50:06.845 --> 50:09.148
Oh, so here you are.

50:13.184 --> 50:15.387
You barely
touched your breakfast.

50:19.490 --> 50:22.528
This will take
just a few seconds.

50:27.131 --> 50:29.968
120/180.

50:30.001 --> 50:32.403
Still in the normal range.

50:38.343 --> 50:41.213
This will take
just a few seconds.

50:57.528 --> 51:04.236
Oh, my dear, this is the worst
I've seen you.

51:04.269 --> 51:06.537
You look really tired.

51:06.570 --> 51:09.373
You haven't been
taking care of yourself.

51:09.407 --> 51:12.043
I'm having trouble sleeping.

51:12.075 --> 51:14.945
Oh.
I haven't been sleeping at all.

51:14.979 --> 51:18.917
- How's Carmen doing?
- She's still with her family.

51:20.050 --> 51:22.586
She was supposed
to return last week.

51:22.619 --> 51:26.523
She left me a message
that she needed more time.

51:26.557 --> 51:30.529
It must be a very difficult
time for her, poor sweetheart.

51:31.496 --> 51:34.398
She's strong. She'll be okay.

51:34.432 --> 51:40.639
It's no five-star hotel, but it certainly
is better than where they had her.

51:40.671 --> 51:43.675
What a putrid
color on these walls.

51:43.707 --> 51:46.211
I'm going to get some coffee.

51:50.648 --> 51:52.918
Mr. Bridges?

51:54.017 --> 51:56.188
Doctor Lewis will see you now.

51:57.454 --> 51:59.157
Right this way.

52:07.398 --> 52:12.204
Please, have a seat. The doctor
will be with you in just a moment.

52:18.575 --> 52:21.478
- They have a morning appointment.
- Thanks.

52:21.512 --> 52:25.316
- Who are they?
- Uh, Mr. Bridges and Mrs. Madison.

52:25.349 --> 52:28.219
Thank you. Okay.

52:31.155 --> 52:33.191
Hello.

52:33.224 --> 52:36.528
Doctor Lewis, this is Mr. Bridges
and this is Mrs. Madison.

52:36.561 --> 52:39.731
Mrs. Madison.
Mr. Bridges. Please, sit down.

52:39.764 --> 52:42.666
. Thank you.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.102
Thank you for coming in.

52:46.738 --> 52:51.009
I understand that this must be
quite a difficult time for you both.

52:52.709 --> 52:56.613
- It's incomprehensible.
- The pain is excruciating.

52:56.646 --> 53:00.284
Yeah. I bet it is.

53:00.318 --> 53:05.590
Last Friday when your wife was
transferred here to this hospital,

53:05.622 --> 53:08.492
I saw her just briefly...
it was last Friday, wasn't it, Jennifer?

53:08.526 --> 53:11.396
- Last Friday, yes.
- Yeah, last Friday.

53:11.428 --> 53:13.231
I saw her just briefly.

53:13.264 --> 53:16.034
It was rather late in the day
and, um,

53:16.066 --> 53:20.637
I was only able to run a few
preliminary tests on her, you see?

53:20.671 --> 53:24.209
When was the last time you saw your
wife, Mr. Bridges?

53:24.242 --> 53:26.711
I've only seen her once.

53:26.744 --> 53:31.015
And that was the, um, day
after she was admitted.

53:32.182 --> 53:36.688
Uh, and our lawyer made several attempts
to get permission for me to visit again,

53:36.720 --> 53:40.057
but, um, his requests
were all denied.

53:40.090 --> 53:43.527
Well, that's normal legal
procedure in cases such as these.

53:44.528 --> 53:46.097
Excuse me.

53:47.664 --> 53:50.634
Yes?
No, it's 4:30.

53:50.668 --> 53:54.139
I don't know, she talked to
Carter, I think. Check on it. Yeah.

53:54.171 --> 53:56.474
Sorry about that.

53:56.506 --> 54:02.613
Right, now. I need to prepare you for
some not altogether encouraging news.

54:02.646 --> 54:08.285
Your wife continues to remain
in a state of severe catatonia.

54:09.653 --> 54:13.390
- It's been almost three months.
- Mm-hmm.

54:13.423 --> 54:15.626
What treatments
has she received?

54:15.660 --> 54:18.396
Ativan.
Pretty high dosage.

54:18.428 --> 54:22.434
Eight milligrams, uh,
three times a day.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.468
- That's all?
- No.

54:24.501 --> 54:28.806
ECT authorization has been submitted
and is pending court approval.

54:28.840 --> 54:33.111
- That's, uh, ECT? That's electroconvulsive therapy?
- Right.

54:33.144 --> 54:36.180
They can't do that
without our approval.

54:36.213 --> 54:40.250
That decision rests with the
state, Mrs. Madison.

54:40.284 --> 54:41.820
Not with the family.

54:43.720 --> 54:47.791
Okay, so now I need to ask some
specific questions about her past.

54:47.825 --> 54:50.462
Was she ever given a psychiatric
evaluation or diagnosis?

54:50.494 --> 54:54.331
- She saw countless doctors when she was younger.
- Hmm.

54:54.365 --> 54:57.334
Some said she was
borderline schizophrenic.

54:57.367 --> 54:59.603
Some said bipolar.

54:59.637 --> 55:02.774
All prescribed
different medications.

55:02.807 --> 55:04.776
Can you remember
the medications?

55:04.809 --> 55:09.414
Well, everything from Prozac to Lithium.
Nothing ever worked.

55:09.447 --> 55:11.849
- Lithium?
- Lithium. - Okay.

55:11.883 --> 55:15.887
A family friend recommended
we see his shaman in Arizona.

55:15.919 --> 55:17.822
And so we went.

55:17.854 --> 55:22.226
Then he recommended
we see his teacher in Peru.

55:22.260 --> 55:23.727
Flew there, too.

55:23.760 --> 55:27.631
They aligned her chakras.
We did drum circles.

55:28.532 --> 55:31.335
Complete waste
of time and money.

55:31.369 --> 55:34.773
- Hmm. Drum circles?
- Yes. - Okay.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.775
Has she ever been hospitalized?

55:39.744 --> 55:41.912
A long time ago.

55:41.945 --> 55:45.349
She cut her wrist
when she was fifteen.

55:45.383 --> 55:47.285
Attempted suicide?

55:47.318 --> 55:50.588
- It was more a cry for attention.
- I never heard that.

55:50.621 --> 55:54.791
Attempting suicide is never a
cry for attention, Mrs. Madison.

55:54.825 --> 56:00.732
It's symptomatic of something
deeper, something more serious.

56:00.764 --> 56:05.536
- Is there history of suicide in your family?
- Yes.

56:05.570 --> 56:08.405
My daddy committed suicide.

56:08.439 --> 56:10.642
Oh, my God!
I should have been told.

56:10.675 --> 56:13.278
What else don't I know?

56:13.311 --> 56:15.780
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

56:15.813 --> 56:18.483
It's something
we don't talk about.

56:18.515 --> 56:20.718
Tell me, Mr. Bridges.

56:20.751 --> 56:22.754
What was it like
living with Elyse?

56:22.787 --> 56:26.691
Us? Well, you know, it's been hell.
Um...

56:28.226 --> 56:31.229
- Does that answer your question?
- Yeah.

56:31.262 --> 56:36.467
Oh, I found these strange
photographs in her camera.

56:36.499 --> 56:40.505
- They're very odd.
- My daughter is an excellent photographer.

56:40.537 --> 56:45.342
- Maybe they can tell you something.
- These photos are amateur.

56:45.376 --> 56:47.312
- Thank you.
- Sure.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.651
Oh, they're interesting.
Uh, can I keep these in her file?

56:53.684 --> 56:55.787
- Yeah.
- There's one thing.

56:55.820 --> 56:59.691
Obviously she's been displaying
unusual behavior for quite some time.

56:59.724 --> 57:04.729
I'm just curious as to why you never
sought out some medical or psychiatric help

57:04.762 --> 57:07.265
before this event.

57:07.298 --> 57:08.967
Well, I tried.

57:08.999 --> 57:12.836
I never thought it would, um,
escalate to this point.

57:12.869 --> 57:16.707
In hindsight, I guess I should
have insisted she get help.

57:16.740 --> 57:18.642
Given this
collateral information,

57:18.675 --> 57:23.914
my preliminary diagnosis is
Borderline Personality Disorder

57:23.947 --> 57:28.952
and Severe Depression.
And I mean, severe depression.

57:28.985 --> 57:33.490
Catastrophic, given attempted suicide, you know?

57:33.523 --> 57:36.793
However, our immediate goal
is to bring your wife,

57:36.827 --> 57:40.665
your daughter out from this catatonic
state. And, uh, this afternoon...

57:40.697 --> 57:43.433
Did that fucking ECT
authorization come through?

57:43.467 --> 57:45.736
- It should arrive this afternoon.
- Good.

57:45.769 --> 57:51.309
I've seen remarkable results,
even after the first treatment.

58:00.918 --> 58:03.555
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

58:11.028 --> 58:13.031
Elyse, swallow.

58:21.838 --> 58:24.842
God, God, God!

58:25.776 --> 58:27.611
Let's step out of the room.

58:29.880 --> 58:33.084
I know seeing your daughter in
this condition is very painful.

58:33.117 --> 58:36.421
As difficult as it is
to understand, um,

58:36.454 --> 58:39.823
it is possible that she's
cognizant of her environment.

58:40.890 --> 58:43.327
Let me walk you
to the waiting room.

58:46.664 --> 58:51.936
I need to get back to the room. The nurse's
station is there if you need anything, okay?

58:56.874 --> 58:59.477
Thank you for
taking her out of the room.

59:00.543 --> 59:03.413
I tried to feed her the rest of the
yogurt, but she's not swallowing.

59:03.447 --> 59:05.682
Yeah. We removed the feeding
tube and IV on Friday, so.

59:05.715 --> 59:09.920
It will be a little time
before her swallowing improves.

59:11.122 --> 59:12.924
I was concerned
about the feeding tube.

59:12.956 --> 59:14.825
Yeah.
It's definitely a good sign.

59:14.858 --> 59:17.427
You have my cell.
Let me know when she's scheduled for ECT.

59:17.461 --> 59:20.398
Yes. Doctor Lewis always
recommends the family be present,

59:20.430 --> 59:22.099
so I'll definitely
be calling you.

59:41.584 --> 59:43.387
ECT treatments
are very effective.

59:45.523 --> 59:47.959
Yes, Doctor Lewis told me.

59:47.992 --> 59:51.896
You'll see tremendous improvement
after a few treatments.

59:51.928 --> 59:54.832
Hopefully, she'll be able
to start physical therapy soon.

59:55.733 --> 1:00:01.539
Oh, and for that reason, would you mind bringing
Elyse some comfortable clothes and shoes?

1:00:01.572 --> 1:00:04.541
You know?
For the therapy?

1:00:04.575 --> 1:00:07.912
Uh, yes, of course.

1:00:07.945 --> 1:00:11.015
Thank you.
I'll be waiting for your call.

1:00:32.503 --> 1:00:34.104
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, doctor.

1:00:34.137 --> 1:00:36.440
Good afternoon, Elyse.

1:00:36.474 --> 1:00:39.744
- How is she doing? Is she eating?
- Not much.

1:00:39.776 --> 1:00:41.012
Elyse?

1:00:42.246 --> 1:00:43.881
I want you to try to sit up.

1:00:46.249 --> 1:00:49.753
Help her sit up.
At the edge of the bed.

1:00:55.226 --> 1:00:56.428
Good.

1:00:57.695 --> 1:00:59.530
You can take your arm away.

1:01:00.530 --> 1:01:01.632
Good.

1:01:05.535 --> 1:01:06.938
Elyse?

1:01:08.005 --> 1:01:09.840
Do you know where you are?

1:01:12.642 --> 1:01:14.445
Do you know today's date?

1:01:15.713 --> 1:01:18.950
Or the month? Or the year?

1:01:22.552 --> 1:01:24.488
I'm going to take your arm.

1:01:24.521 --> 1:01:28.159
Gently. Let it come with me.
That's good.

1:01:32.028 --> 1:01:33.697
Good.

1:01:35.231 --> 1:01:40.070
Elyse, are you aware that
there may be something wrong?

1:01:42.706 --> 1:01:46.644
Can you describe how
you feel at this moment?

1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:57.755
Displaying waxy flexibility,
characteristic of catatonia.

1:02:02.126 --> 1:02:03.561
Lay her back.

1:02:04.961 --> 1:02:07.797
The authorization
for ECT is on your desk?

1:02:07.831 --> 1:02:09.834
Yes, doctor.

1:02:09.867 --> 1:02:11.769
- What time is it?
- It's scheduled for 7:30 in the morning.

1:02:11.802 --> 1:02:14.639
- 7:30. Doctor Rosenthal is set up?
- Yes. Yes. They are.

1:02:14.671 --> 1:02:16.039
Good.

1:02:16.072 --> 1:02:17.574
Bye, Elyse.

1:02:18.309 --> 1:02:19.811
Elyse?

1:02:22.646 --> 1:02:24.282
Tomorrow, 7:30.

1:02:30.688 --> 1:02:32.689
- Good morning, Doctor Lewis.
- Good morning.

1:02:32.722 --> 1:02:34.824
Everything ready? Good.

1:02:34.858 --> 1:02:37.093
Mr. Bridges, this is Doctor
Rosenthal, Mr. Bridges.

1:02:37.126 --> 1:02:39.930
Your wife is in good
hands with Doctor Rosenthal.

1:02:39.963 --> 1:02:43.767
And I'll come back as soon as
the treatment is over. All right?

1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:46.603
- Doctor Rosenthal? - Thank you, Doctor.
- It's all yours.

1:02:48.005 --> 1:02:51.108
Thank you for being here.
I want to walk you through the procedure.

1:02:52.041 --> 1:02:54.578
Mrs. Bridges, my name
is Doctor Rosenthal.

1:02:54.611 --> 1:02:57.881
Today we're going to be performing
ECT to treat your catatonia.

1:02:57.914 --> 1:03:00.750
You'll be put under anesthesia
so you shouldn't feel a thing.

1:03:00.784 --> 1:03:03.854
And the court has authorized
this treatment for you.

1:03:03.887 --> 1:03:06.157
Do you have any questions?
Anything you want to say?

1:03:07.323 --> 1:03:10.327
Are there any long term repercussions
I should be concerned with?

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:13.263
No.
No cumulative adverse effects.

1:03:14.932 --> 1:03:17.035
Okay. Let's begin.

1:03:48.331 --> 1:03:50.367
<i>What a beautiful woman.</i>

1:03:57.407 --> 1:03:59.843
She did well
for her first treatment.

1:03:59.876 --> 1:04:02.813
She should come to very shortly.
Probably within the hour.

1:04:02.845 --> 1:04:04.849
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:30.441 --> 1:04:34.145
Oh, they're so beautiful!

1:05:01.338 --> 1:05:03.975
Oh! My big belly!

1:05:06.410 --> 1:05:09.414
- Mm, I love you.
- I love you.

1:05:12.249 --> 1:05:15.319
Doesn't she look like a ballet dancer?
She's like...

1:05:15.352 --> 1:05:17.388
Ah, so beautiful.

1:05:21.959 --> 1:05:24.062
Stay with me.

1:05:32.436 --> 1:05:34.138
Back up.

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:46.117
Could this be
any more beautiful?

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:49.452
- They look like dancers, these trees.
- Oh, I know.

1:05:49.485 --> 1:05:52.288
We're having a baby.

1:05:55.258 --> 1:05:57.527
I love you.

1:05:57.561 --> 1:05:59.463
Oh, look at this one!

1:05:59.496 --> 1:06:04.267
Oh, oh, I love it.

1:06:07.037 --> 1:06:10.241
This'll look great in the new house.
I want to blow them up.

1:06:10.273 --> 1:06:13.343
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:06:15.512 --> 1:06:19.015
I'm getting you!

1:06:19.950 --> 1:06:23.854
How much do you love me?
Oh, that much?

1:06:23.887 --> 1:06:26.023
This much!

1:06:26.055 --> 1:06:27.224
Show me your tummy.

1:06:29.226 --> 1:06:33.798
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you look good. Oh!

1:06:33.831 --> 1:06:36.033
You're silly!

1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:53.184
I also brought some
clothes like you asked.

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:55.952
Thank you.
She'll be more comfortable.

1:06:58.287 --> 1:06:59.523
Is that the pillow?

1:07:00.923 --> 1:07:04.427
It's roses.
She loved roses.

1:07:04.461 --> 1:07:06.863
She loves roses.

1:07:14.872 --> 1:07:17.140
One second.
Ask Doctor Lewis to call me.

1:07:17.173 --> 1:07:19.110
- Will do.
- Yeah.

1:07:20.878 --> 1:07:26.450
Well, now that I know you love roses, I'll
bring you one from my mother's garden, okay?

1:07:27.483 --> 1:07:30.286
Would you like a
white or a red rose?

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:35.159
Elyse? Well, guess what?
I've just become a mind reader.

1:07:35.191 --> 1:07:39.463
I think you prefer red roses.
Don't you?

1:08:07.657 --> 1:08:11.027
- Steven?
- Coming.

1:08:14.030 --> 1:08:18.968
My friend Bianca, she'll be here between four
and six to pick up the rest of my things.

1:08:19.001 --> 1:08:21.472
I hope that's okay.

1:08:21.504 --> 1:08:23.039
I'm here all day.

1:08:28.946 --> 1:08:32.617
Oh, God! I told myself
I wasn't going to do this.

1:08:44.294 --> 1:08:49.633
Don't be a stranger, hmm?
This is always home for you.

1:08:49.665 --> 1:08:51.968
Thank you.

1:08:52.001 --> 1:08:54.638
You'll always be
a big part of my life.

1:09:11.487 --> 1:09:13.523
- Hi, Lindsey.
- Hi.

1:09:15.525 --> 1:09:18.394
- I guess about an hour?
- That sounds good.

1:09:18.428 --> 1:09:19.662
I'll be back.

1:09:19.696 --> 1:09:21.298
Hi, Elyse, I'm Lindsey.

1:09:21.330 --> 1:09:23.566
I'm going to
help you walk today.

1:09:26.702 --> 1:09:30.506
I'm going to put one hand
on each rest here. Good.

1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:34.512
And now, lean forward
and push up to stand.

1:09:40.549 --> 1:09:44.020
And now let me have
you take some steps forward.

1:09:51.294 --> 1:09:52.530
You're doing great.

1:10:01.204 --> 1:10:05.041
- Hello, Mrs. Madison.
- Hello, dear.

1:10:05.075 --> 1:10:09.246
Oh, sweetheart.

1:10:09.278 --> 1:10:12.015
You look so beautiful.

1:10:12.049 --> 1:10:14.151
Your hair's getting long.

1:10:14.183 --> 1:10:18.054
And you're finally wearing that
sweater I bought you in Italy.

1:10:18.088 --> 1:10:20.491
It's one hundred
percent cashmere.

1:10:20.523 --> 1:10:24.695
And I have another surprise for you.
Wait till you see it.

1:10:26.796 --> 1:10:28.531
Now stand.

1:10:29.799 --> 1:10:32.369
Let's stand. Come on.

1:10:33.836 --> 1:10:37.640
Walk to the bed.
Walk to the bed.

1:10:41.777 --> 1:10:44.548
Today is the first day she's walking.
It's great.

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:48.184
It's a miracle.
I have a surprise for you.

1:10:48.218 --> 1:10:51.688
Look. Ta-da!

1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.124
Lip gloss.

1:10:54.156 --> 1:10:55.491
Mascara.

1:10:55.525 --> 1:10:57.494
Moisturizer.

1:10:57.527 --> 1:11:02.099
And these little clips
for your hair.

1:11:02.131 --> 1:11:03.701
There it is.

1:11:04.867 --> 1:11:08.638
Let mother freshen you up.

1:11:08.671 --> 1:11:10.174
Yes.

1:11:11.273 --> 1:11:14.178
Oh. So beautiful.

1:11:14.210 --> 1:11:16.245
You never need much.

1:11:16.278 --> 1:11:19.183
I'm so happy to
see you're feeling better.

1:11:19.215 --> 1:11:22.151
- And soon we'll be going to occupational therapy.
- Oh!

1:11:22.184 --> 1:11:24.821
Where you can draw, 'cause
I hear you're an amazing artist.

1:11:24.854 --> 1:11:28.759
She is a magnificent artist.

1:11:30.427 --> 1:11:35.232
You need to get some rest.
Oh, I love you.

1:11:41.871 --> 1:11:43.506
Goodbye, dear.

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:45.743
I know Elyse
appreciates your visits.

1:11:48.512 --> 1:11:50.548
What a sweet woman.

1:11:53.183 --> 1:11:55.786
You're not going to believe
what I did last night.

1:11:56.753 --> 1:12:00.157
I adopted this little guy,
Elyse.

1:12:00.189 --> 1:12:01.625
You like cats?

1:12:02.692 --> 1:12:04.462
Do you have a cat?

1:12:05.495 --> 1:12:07.331
No? You don't have a cat?

1:12:08.231 --> 1:12:11.135
Well, I haven't named him yet.
Maybe you can help me.

1:12:11.168 --> 1:12:15.738
'Cause I was thinking of, uh,
Chianti. What do you think?

1:12:16.872 --> 1:12:20.177
You don't like Chianti.
That's okay.

1:12:20.210 --> 1:12:24.215
How about Bordeaux?

1:12:25.514 --> 1:12:29.486
Bordeaux?
Bordeaux it is.

1:14:08.485 --> 1:14:13.424
Here's your book, Elyse.
Here, let's finish this drawing.

1:14:14.657 --> 1:14:17.593
Let go.
Okay. Perfect.

1:14:17.626 --> 1:14:19.530
I'll be over there, okay?

1:14:28.571 --> 1:14:30.774
Do you want to
finish your artwork today?

1:14:30.807 --> 1:14:33.309
- Hi, Natalia.
- What do you want?

1:14:33.343 --> 1:14:35.012
I'll be in the other room.

1:14:38.982 --> 1:14:42.586
I want paint with you.
I'm artist.

1:14:42.619 --> 1:14:44.321
Okay, come on.
Finish your painting.

1:14:44.353 --> 1:14:46.555
- Why you no talk?
- Jen?

1:14:46.589 --> 1:14:50.861
- I want paint with you. I want paint with you! I'm artist!
- That's enough.

1:14:50.893 --> 1:14:56.732
Why you no talk? You my friend.
You my friend. We should talk, my friend.

1:14:56.765 --> 1:15:02.272
Elyse? Everything okay, Elyse?
Everything okay?

1:15:05.375 --> 1:15:08.979
Is this rain? No?

1:15:10.746 --> 1:15:14.317
Would you like a walk instead?
Yes?

1:15:14.351 --> 1:15:18.755
Yes? Okay. Okay.
Let's go. Okay, let's go.

1:15:20.924 --> 1:15:23.360
Let's go for a walk.

1:15:40.943 --> 1:15:44.747
I go there as often as
possible throughout the day.

1:15:46.448 --> 1:15:48.884
I love California light.

1:15:48.918 --> 1:15:53.624
There's something that
I find very moving about it.

1:15:56.459 --> 1:16:01.932
In some sort of way, it reminds me of
my, uh, childhood in France.

1:16:02.831 --> 1:16:07.003
My mom left to the US
when I was eight

1:16:08.138 --> 1:16:10.707
to give us a better life.

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:13.911
So my grandmother raised me.

1:16:16.446 --> 1:16:19.983
And for years
I resented her for doing this.

1:16:20.015 --> 1:16:21.585
For leaving me.

1:16:23.519 --> 1:16:25.888
Parents do the best they can.

1:16:25.921 --> 1:16:28.759
Deep down
they all love their children.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:36.599
And we can't forget that once upon a
time they were children themselves.

1:16:36.633 --> 1:16:37.867
Who knows
what they went through?

1:16:41.603 --> 1:16:43.973
I've come to terms with my past.

1:16:52.214 --> 1:16:54.116
We better go.

1:16:54.150 --> 1:16:57.019
You have an appointment
with Doctor Lewis now.

1:17:34.089 --> 1:17:35.592
Good.

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:39.162
Elyse. Good morning.

1:17:41.598 --> 1:17:43.867
Sit down, please.

1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:45.634
- Good.
- Elyse?

1:17:45.668 --> 1:17:47.137
Please have a seat.

1:17:49.104 --> 1:17:51.174
Okay.

1:17:51.206 --> 1:17:54.643
- I'll be outside, Doctor.
- No, I want you to stay. Close the door.

1:17:54.677 --> 1:17:59.883
I want you to stay because she seems
more responsive when she's with you.

1:18:00.849 --> 1:18:02.885
Elyse? Hello.

1:18:04.254 --> 1:18:08.091
You remember me? Yes.

1:18:08.124 --> 1:18:11.695
Can you tell me where you are?

1:18:12.795 --> 1:18:14.231
This room. Your surroundings.

1:18:16.232 --> 1:18:20.604
Good. Can you tell me
verbally where you are?

1:18:24.973 --> 1:18:26.142
All right.

1:18:28.076 --> 1:18:31.013
Now, I know
you're a very good artist.

1:18:31.046 --> 1:18:34.183
I'm going to give you a
pad and paper and a pen.

1:18:34.217 --> 1:18:38.222
I want you to draw for me your
surroundings of where you are.

1:18:40.322 --> 1:18:42.124
Free association.

1:18:45.894 --> 1:18:48.231
- What's that?
- She's drawing the view from the atrium.

1:18:48.263 --> 1:18:49.799
Uh-huh.

1:18:52.902 --> 1:18:55.639
And my cat.
She likes my cat Bordeaux.

1:18:56.572 --> 1:18:57.773
You bring your cat to work?

1:18:57.807 --> 1:18:59.910
No, no, Doctor.
I show her photos.

1:18:59.942 --> 1:19:01.177
Yeah.

1:19:01.210 --> 1:19:03.213
You can take the pad from her.

1:19:04.313 --> 1:19:06.182
Good. Elyse?

1:19:06.214 --> 1:19:11.654
Do you know that you're
in the Lennox State Hospital?

1:19:11.687 --> 1:19:13.122
Do you understand?

1:19:14.156 --> 1:19:19.628
Uh, patients with catatonia,
many make good progress

1:19:19.661 --> 1:19:21.597
with ECT treatment.

1:19:22.932 --> 1:19:27.036
Now, you've been here,
just over six months.

1:19:27.070 --> 1:19:29.738
You've made minimal progress.

1:19:29.772 --> 1:19:34.845
But I'm a little concerned, because I want
to bring you totally out of this condition.

1:19:39.848 --> 1:19:42.852
You understand me?
Look at me.

1:19:45.153 --> 1:19:48.825
Tell me.
Have we got a deal?

1:19:56.299 --> 1:19:59.303
I'm so happy
to see you doing so well.

1:20:02.037 --> 1:20:04.741
You look pretty when you smile.
You know that, right?

1:20:17.786 --> 1:20:19.121
Can you excuse us?

1:20:21.924 --> 1:20:24.961
- Can you excuse us?
- Yes. Yes.

1:20:24.994 --> 1:20:27.764
- But I can't leave her alone.
- I don't give a fuck!

1:20:30.967 --> 1:20:34.204
I've called Doctor Lewis and you
several times in the last few weeks.

1:20:34.237 --> 1:20:36.873
Why doesn't anyone have
the courtesy to return my calls?

1:20:36.906 --> 1:20:39.943
I've tried calling you several
and your voicemail's always full.

1:20:39.976 --> 1:20:42.245
That's bullshit!
You can call my office.

1:20:43.780 --> 1:20:45.816
I'll be... I'll be nearby.

1:20:49.352 --> 1:20:51.854
I saw your face.

1:20:51.888 --> 1:20:53.823
Like you don't
have a care in the world.

1:20:55.258 --> 1:20:59.829
And then you see me
and it's a different face.

1:20:59.862 --> 1:21:05.435
A face of misery and death.

1:21:05.468 --> 1:21:10.807
That's what I see when I
look in your eyes. Death.

1:21:12.474 --> 1:21:15.911
I haven't slept at
the house in months.

1:21:16.912 --> 1:21:19.415
I am selling it.

1:21:23.018 --> 1:21:25.054
Listen to these words, Elyse.

1:21:26.856 --> 1:21:31.327
I don't know
what life has in store for you.

1:21:33.228 --> 1:21:38.300
But I am done.

1:21:38.334 --> 1:21:40.037
Elyse, how are you feeling?

1:21:41.937 --> 1:21:47.309
Patient remains in a
state of severe catatonia.

1:22:36.392 --> 1:22:41.865
It's been one year today.
And Mr. Bridges, since your last visit,

1:22:41.897 --> 1:22:44.500
your wife has suffered
a relapse or a setback.

1:22:44.534 --> 1:22:48.504
And up until that point
we were making fair progress.

1:22:48.537 --> 1:22:53.343
So, as you can imagine,
we are rather disappointed and frustrated.

1:22:55.510 --> 1:22:57.147
Thank you.

1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:01.017
What happened?

1:23:01.049 --> 1:23:04.320
What do you mean what happened?

1:23:06.888 --> 1:23:09.491
I don't know who you are!

1:23:09.525 --> 1:23:11.795
I don't know
who your daughter is!

1:23:13.028 --> 1:23:15.898
I'm a stranger in this family.

1:23:15.932 --> 1:23:18.902
I've always made myself
available to you, Steven.

1:23:18.934 --> 1:23:21.870
Why didn't you call me?
What's wrong?

1:23:21.903 --> 1:23:24.540
What are you going to give
me to take the place of my son?

1:23:36.585 --> 1:23:39.789
Nothing will bring him back!
Nothing!

1:23:46.062 --> 1:23:48.932
Hold on one second.
Hey, Steven. It's the office.

1:23:50.398 --> 1:23:52.501
This is our family time!

1:23:52.535 --> 1:23:54.537
What the fuck is she
still doing in our house?

1:23:54.570 --> 1:23:56.171
- You know what?
- She's supposed to be here.

1:23:56.205 --> 1:24:00.143
- You can fuck her if you want!
- Elyse! Stop it!

1:24:00.175 --> 1:24:03.446
You can fuck her all you want!
I'm fucking over it!

1:24:03.478 --> 1:24:06.849
You can have her!
I'm out of here!

1:24:29.004 --> 1:24:32.174
Fuck you!

1:24:32.207 --> 1:24:35.111
I have nightmares.

1:24:35.143 --> 1:24:39.849
Seeing his dead
body covered in blood.

1:24:43.085 --> 1:24:45.955
Mommy! Mommy!

1:24:47.656 --> 1:24:49.224
Mommy! Mommy!

1:25:24.326 --> 1:25:27.562
<i>Calling Dr. Lewis to room
333. Calling Dr. Lewis to room 333.</i>

1:26:24.719 --> 1:26:27.423
I'm sorry.
I should have told you I was coming.

1:26:28.491 --> 1:26:32.696
- It's okay.
- She knows you're here. Come speak to her.

1:26:40.469 --> 1:26:44.040
I woke up this morning feeling
it was time to come see you.

1:26:48.309 --> 1:26:52.115
On the way here, I stopped by the
cemetery and put flowers for my mother.

1:26:53.715 --> 1:26:56.052
It's their anniversary.

1:27:00.055 --> 1:27:06.129
I don't know if I'm imagining this,
but I feel my mother is by my side.

1:27:07.228 --> 1:27:09.631
She's with me everywhere I go.

1:27:12.668 --> 1:27:15.604
It gives me great comfort.

1:27:20.776 --> 1:27:24.147
You know... time?

1:27:25.747 --> 1:27:27.717
Time is compassionate.

1:27:28.817 --> 1:27:31.320
It has a way of healing us.

1:28:07.423 --> 1:28:09.759
<i>Dearest, Steven.</i>

1:28:09.791 --> 1:28:16.365
<i>Yesterday I saw you and your family
at the Malibu Christmas Tree Shop.</i>

1:28:16.397 --> 1:28:20.669
<i>I didn't say hello.
I felt it was inappropriate.</i>

1:28:21.670 --> 1:28:26.175
<i>Congratulations,
your daughter is beautiful.</i>

1:28:26.207 --> 1:28:31.546
<i>I married David five years ago.
He's very kind to me.</i>

1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:33.483
<i>We live a simple life.</i>

1:28:34.750 --> 1:28:39.155
<i>My mother is now in a home
for assisted living.</i>

1:28:39.187 --> 1:28:41.756
<i>She turned
eighty-eight last week.</i>

1:28:41.790 --> 1:28:47.463
<i>We had a little party for her.
She's very frail.</i>

1:28:47.495 --> 1:28:52.101
<i>I go see her once in a while,
but she doesn't recognize me.</i>

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:55.737
<i>No idea who I am.</i>

1:28:55.771 --> 1:28:59.142
<i>Strange, isn't it?</i>

1:28:59.174 --> 1:29:01.209
<i>Life.</i>

1:29:01.242 --> 1:29:05.848
<i>Be well.
My love always, Elyse.</i>
