10:15.880 --> 10:18.990
So the bank wanted to be able
to offer complete anonymity.

10:19.190 --> 10:21.340
The accounts were only
identified by number,

10:21.540 --> 10:23.080
and only the system
knew which names

10:23.280 --> 10:24.740
were associated
with the accounts.

10:24.940 --> 10:27.130
- But as the designer,
Philippe could get around that?

10:27.330 --> 10:29.480
Yeah, he compiled the list,

10:29.680 --> 10:31.790
complete with real names
and balances.

10:31.990 --> 10:34.660
It's a document that was
never supposed to exist.

10:54.710 --> 10:56.520
he never mentioned a wife.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.300
Morand's car was spotted

11:02.500 --> 11:03.560

yesterday morning.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.780
Vo's still knocking on doors,

11:04.980 --> 11:07.000

last night.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.690

11:24.950 --> 11:27.100
She's cooking dinner,
no idea they're going anywhere.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.590
He comes home, grabs the gun,
orders her into the car.

11:30.780 --> 11:31.800
No sign of struggle.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.630
The wife probably
planned the whole thing.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.550

11:39.490 --> 11:42.340

but once I cracked into it,

11:42.540 --> 11:44.640
the whole hard drive was wiped
clean except for one file.

that he can make demands?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.520
He's a thief.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.090
- If the bank's assets are
derived from criminal activity,

12:43.290 --> 12:45.270
it is a crime
not to come forward.

12:45.470 --> 12:46.880
That is hardly the point.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.230
Morand may claim
that he will turn over

12:49.430 --> 12:51.750
the information he stole,
but by making that conditional,

12:51.950 --> 12:53.540
he's now committing
extortion as well.
