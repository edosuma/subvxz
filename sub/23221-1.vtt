00:16.615 --> 00:18.648
[Dan] Static background noise.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.451
You shouldn't get that anyway.

00:21.453 --> 00:24.988
As I sat here at the camp
by myself I decided to

00:24.990 --> 00:26.790
go through my language,

00:26.792 --> 00:28.858
Ojibwe language and put
some things on here to

00:28.860 --> 00:31.595
use for later and
this is what I got.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.665

00:53.519 --> 00:54.584
That's creepy.

00:54.586 --> 00:56.719
I have never had a
recorder do that.

00:56.721 --> 00:59.856
I have once before and it
was at the (mumbles) farm.

00:59.858 --> 01:02.593
It was definitely considered
to be pretty haunted.

01:02.595 --> 01:05.728
Just to double check
I did it again.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.897
Testing one two three.

01:07.899 --> 01:09.999
That's the third one
let me do number five.

01:10.001 --> 01:12.137
(beeping)

01:17.775 --> 01:20.109
All we get is straight
static and I just held it.

01:20.111 --> 01:22.381
(static)

01:24.083 --> 01:26.850
Doesn't that sound like
I'm walking around.

01:26.852 --> 01:27.653
I'm sitting.

01:29.721 --> 01:32.588
It doesn't sound
like randomness.

01:32.590 --> 01:33.457
It's static.
That's what he said.

01:33.459 --> 01:34.257
It sounds almost like a pattern.

01:34.259 --> 01:35.391
[Dan] Sometimes a pattern

01:35.393 --> 01:36.426
like there's rhythm
in there or something.

01:36.428 --> 01:38.627
[Nicole] But didn't
you say you had

01:38.629 --> 01:39.796
some weird static coming
in over your headphones?

01:39.798 --> 01:41.932
[Amy] I had static on
the headphones and the

01:41.934 --> 01:44.534
weird thing is is that I
didn't realize at the time

01:44.536 --> 01:46.870
that the headphones...

01:46.872 --> 01:49.742
(mystical sounds)

02:01.819 --> 02:03.955
(howling)

02:11.696 --> 02:13.999
(whispering)

02:15.333 --> 02:18.203
(water splashing)

02:43.028 --> 02:45.231
(laughter)

02:54.238 --> 02:56.872
[Dispatcher] 911
what is your emergency?

02:56.874 --> 02:58.908
[Caller] I'm calling
from the island.

02:58.910 --> 03:02.612
We have four kids up here
and they're extremely sick.

03:02.614 --> 03:03.980
We need to get them
to a hospital now.

03:03.982 --> 03:05.282
[Dispatcher] Calm down sir.

03:05.284 --> 03:06.883
Can you tell me
what made them sick?

03:06.885 --> 03:07.984
[Caller] I don't know.

03:07.986 --> 03:09.719
[Dispatcher] Is it
something they ate?

03:09.721 --> 03:11.021
[Caller] I don't know!

03:11.023 --> 03:12.622
We're all stranded out here.

03:12.624 --> 03:15.057
We need to get off
the island now!

03:15.059 --> 03:16.727
[Dispatcher]
Please remain calm.

03:16.729 --> 03:17.795
[Caller] Okay okay yes.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.364
[Dispatcher] How
many kids are sick?

03:20.366 --> 03:21.198
[Caller] Four kids.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.398
[Dispatcher] What are ages?

03:22.400 --> 03:25.635
[Caller] Oh for Christ
sake just send someone.

03:25.637 --> 03:27.903
[Dispatcher] We're
heading out sir.

03:27.905 --> 03:29.641
Sir what's going on?

03:34.046 --> 03:37.650
(news reporters speaking)

04:01.974 --> 04:03.773
(sniffling)

04:03.775 --> 04:05.076
Island of lies.

04:08.946 --> 04:11.848
You look as lost as I am.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.986
(sobbing)

04:21.860 --> 04:23.996
I just want to leave here.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.336
I just want to go home.

04:34.706 --> 04:36.576
I just want to go home

04:40.278 --> 04:42.848
and I wanna take a long bath.

04:46.251 --> 04:48.787
I wanna take a nice long bath

04:52.324 --> 04:54.057
and I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

04:54.059 --> 04:56.860
I'm not gonna do
this ever again.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.795
(gasp)
(clanking)

04:59.797 --> 05:02.667
(heavy breathing)

05:15.146 --> 05:18.081
I called and they answered.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.151
Every fucking time they
don't shut the fuck up

05:21.153 --> 05:22.785
but when I need them and
I'm lost in the middle

05:22.787 --> 05:24.389
of the fucking woods.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.792
I got nothing.

05:33.030 --> 05:33.898
The fuck?

05:40.538 --> 05:43.742
(branches snapping)

05:52.884 --> 05:54.252
I'm sorry Jimmy.

05:57.489 --> 05:58.924
I'm sorry Paul.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.030
Jennifer Kate.

06:10.468 --> 06:14.538
Lola and Arlie were
in charge I wasn't.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.338
I'm sorry.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.809
I didn't mean to leave you.

06:27.485 --> 06:29.320
I was just a kid too.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.693
I was scared.

06:38.095 --> 06:38.963
I'm sorry.

06:41.566 --> 06:44.437
(mystical sounds)

07:03.121 --> 07:04.724
Hey there's one.

07:05.857 --> 07:09.091
So far nobody's calling me back.

07:09.093 --> 07:12.062
Hello this is a message for Dan.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.964
Striking out big time here.

07:14.966 --> 07:16.999
10 messages so far.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.869
Hi is this Chuck?

07:18.871 --> 07:19.970
Chuck Harp?

07:19.972 --> 07:21.071
Hey Chuck hi.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.607
This is Chris from
Dogbyte Motion Pictures

07:23.609 --> 07:27.947
and we're doing a documentary
on the Garden Island.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.350
We just need some information
and we wanna talk to some

07:33.352 --> 07:34.718
people about

07:34.720 --> 07:38.088
what might of happened at
that particular point in time.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.291
You interested?

07:41.225 --> 07:43.225
The significance of
this location is,

07:43.227 --> 07:45.295
it's an undisclosed

07:45.297 --> 07:49.531
location in a cemetery up
here in Kent County Michigan,

07:49.533 --> 07:52.968
and the reason why we're
here is because over

07:52.970 --> 07:55.939
that hill over there
there is a memorial.

07:55.941 --> 07:58.475
There's actually four of them.

07:58.477 --> 08:02.545
They went to Garden
Island which is up north

08:02.547 --> 08:06.081
in Lake Michigan
and unfortunately

08:06.083 --> 08:08.018
those four kids
didn't make it back.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.220
Garden Island was
originally inhabited by the

08:10.222 --> 08:13.389
Ojibwe tribe about two
thousand years ago is what

08:13.391 --> 08:14.725
we're finding.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.326
They pretty much lived in
peace until the white man

08:17.328 --> 08:18.196
came over.

08:20.398 --> 08:24.536
Most of the Ojibwe tribe were
killed by a smallpox epidemic.

08:25.703 --> 08:29.506
If they found out
that the government,

08:29.508 --> 08:32.042
that the white man had caused
this disease they would

08:32.044 --> 08:34.210
be increasingly angry

08:34.212 --> 08:38.081
and I can definitely see where
all that anger would channel

08:38.082 --> 08:41.216
to become a very powerful
force in the supernatural.

08:41.217 --> 08:43.352
We're going to be doing a
lot of audio recordings to

08:43.354 --> 08:45.388
see if we can
capture EVP which is

08:45.390 --> 08:47.827
electronic voice phenomena.

08:48.993 --> 08:51.293
As for other aspects,

08:51.295 --> 08:53.596
we could see just
about anything.

08:53.598 --> 08:54.697
We can be seeing shadows,

08:54.699 --> 08:57.133
we can see actual apparitions.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.668
They had several creatures
that they believed in

08:59.670 --> 09:02.138
and they also believed
in shapeshifters as well.

09:02.140 --> 09:03.306
I'm excited.

09:03.308 --> 09:04.173
I'm excited to see

09:04.175 --> 09:07.110
what we can find with research.

09:07.112 --> 09:10.447
No I would not wanna come
up against a creature but

09:10.449 --> 09:13.249
on the paranormal aspect I
cannot wait to get up there

09:13.251 --> 09:15.118
and see what we can document.

09:15.120 --> 09:15.851
[Chris] What are you gonna do

09:15.853 --> 09:17.857
if you see a creature?

09:19.123 --> 09:19.990
Probably run.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.325
(laughing)

09:22.327 --> 09:24.995
It was the first time we'd
ever gone to the island.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.062
When we got there

09:27.064 --> 09:29.032
it was beautiful.

09:29.034 --> 09:29.902
Warm sunny

09:30.669 --> 09:32.668
gorgeous Michigan

09:32.670 --> 09:33.539
day that

09:34.740 --> 09:35.538
you couldn't be better.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.010
Being out there on the lake

09:40.145 --> 09:43.312
and four of the kids went off

09:43.314 --> 09:46.648
hiking and accidentally
discovered this

09:46.650 --> 09:49.287
old Indian burial ground there.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.355
It was right about that
time that everything

09:52.357 --> 09:54.456
sort of changed.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.490
We got

09:55.492 --> 09:58.631
three days of nothing
but rain cold.

09:59.664 --> 10:02.268
All four of the kids got sick.

10:03.668 --> 10:05.004
Katy Jennifer,

10:05.771 --> 10:07.106
Paul and Jimmy

10:09.373 --> 10:10.673
were all sick.

10:10.675 --> 10:13.679
The boys were
feverish and nauseous.

10:14.813 --> 10:17.583
Girls were kind
of cold and pale.

10:18.717 --> 10:22.552
Then Katy started
getting delirious so

10:22.554 --> 10:25.754
a couple of us decided we'd
head on over to the rangers,

10:25.756 --> 10:27.724
to conservation
camp on the island,

10:27.726 --> 10:31.794
and see if we could
get some help for them.

10:31.796 --> 10:35.065
When we got back
the next morning

10:35.067 --> 10:37.536
all four of the kids were gone.

10:39.237 --> 10:40.302
Nobody saw anything,

10:40.304 --> 10:41.571
nobody heard anything.

10:41.573 --> 10:44.474
I still have dreams almost
every night that he's

10:44.476 --> 10:47.342
still alive on that
damn island somewhere.

10:47.344 --> 10:48.610
In fact

10:48.612 --> 10:49.745
it's always the same thing.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.214
He's standing on the
edge of these woods with

10:51.216 --> 10:52.048
his back to me and

10:52.050 --> 10:54.551
I start to call his name and

10:54.553 --> 10:57.486
just as he's about to
turn and look at me

10:57.488 --> 10:59.522
I wake up in a cold
sweat every time with my

10:59.524 --> 11:00.726
heart thumping.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.861
It really did a
number on our mom too.

11:05.863 --> 11:07.596
She never really got over it.

11:07.598 --> 11:09.398
I was working
dispatch that night

11:09.400 --> 11:11.600
and got the distress call.

11:11.602 --> 11:14.504
They wanted an
immediate airlift out.

11:14.506 --> 11:17.440
We couldn't move the
plane because of the fog.

11:17.442 --> 11:18.508
The next day,

11:18.510 --> 11:20.176
it was about 7:00 a.m.,

11:20.178 --> 11:24.246
still that thick fog
so we took the boat.

11:24.248 --> 11:28.551
That guy searched the
entire island and nothing.

11:28.553 --> 11:32.024
They were there for
three days, nothing.

11:34.391 --> 11:35.859
I know it's been years but

11:35.861 --> 11:37.594
I can't stop thinking about it.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.562
I need to know what
happened to him.

11:39.564 --> 11:42.365
What happened on that island?

11:42.367 --> 11:43.600
It's a tiny island,

11:43.602 --> 11:45.434
there's nothing there.

11:45.436 --> 11:48.370
Four kids can't just disappear
off the face of the earth.

11:48.372 --> 11:51.640
It's been more than 20 years
since this happened but

11:51.642 --> 11:53.342
I was his big brother.

11:53.344 --> 11:55.445
I should have been
there to help him.

11:55.447 --> 11:56.245
That's my job.

11:56.247 --> 11:58.413
I'm supposed to protect him

11:58.415 --> 11:59.417
but I wasn't

12:00.684 --> 12:02.021
and he's gone.

12:08.193 --> 12:13.163
We're here in Charlevoix,
Michigan and it is an absolutely

12:13.165 --> 12:14.331
beautiful town.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.831
We're gonna go over here
and see if we can get

12:15.833 --> 12:16.832
an interview.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.168
See if anybody
perhaps went past.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.269
They head towards the goal

12:20.271 --> 12:22.839
around Garden Island
and Whiskey Island.

12:22.841 --> 12:25.874
Garden Island's owned entirely
by the state of Michigan

12:25.876 --> 12:28.778
and it's the closest
island to Beaver Island.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.315
Right there right
above Beaver Island.

12:32.317 --> 12:33.148
[Chris] Have you been there?

12:33.150 --> 12:36.418
[Man] I haven't been there.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.287
I've been by it.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.488
I drove all the way around it.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.621
We did a lighthouse tour
and we went all the way

12:39.623 --> 12:43.692
up around it and come
through this channel

12:43.694 --> 12:45.727
with the boat a couple of times.

12:45.729 --> 12:47.563
There's quite a bit of

12:47.565 --> 12:50.232
ancestral burial grounds.

12:50.234 --> 12:52.568
A lot of people don't
actually know about it.

12:52.570 --> 12:54.236
It's only a mile off Beaver
Island but yet a lot of

12:54.238 --> 12:55.572
people don't know about it.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.874
It also supports a lot of
snakes and a lot of other

12:58.876 --> 12:59.975
wildlife so

12:59.977 --> 13:02.345
it's not an island
that's for everybody.

13:02.347 --> 13:05.748
[Amy] Would it be
easy to get lost?

13:05.750 --> 13:09.619
There are some paths but
you'd have to stay on them.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.354
Lot's of poison ivy.

13:11.356 --> 13:15.624
You really should be
somewhat experienced in

13:15.626 --> 13:17.293
hiking and

13:17.295 --> 13:18.628
if you want to adventure out.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.763
When an American Indian dies,

13:20.765 --> 13:23.466
specifically of
the Ojibwe culture,

13:23.468 --> 13:27.503
it's traditional to bury them
and then build a structure

13:27.505 --> 13:28.671
on top of their grave.

13:28.673 --> 13:30.606
There are 3500 graves.

13:30.608 --> 13:31.707
Most of them

13:31.709 --> 13:32.942
don't have spirit houses.

13:32.944 --> 13:34.943
They're unmarked.

13:34.945 --> 13:36.645
Pretty much from
my understanding,

13:36.647 --> 13:39.249
anywhere that you go
on the island there's

13:39.251 --> 13:41.951
the possibility that there is

13:41.953 --> 13:45.455
somebody buried beneath you
which is particularly intriguing

13:45.457 --> 13:47.690
since we're bringing a
paranormal crew with us.

13:47.692 --> 13:51.326
My best advice would be
not to go to Garden Island.

13:51.328 --> 13:52.396
It's haunted.

13:53.931 --> 13:55.932
I've heard of voices and

13:55.934 --> 13:57.734
just crazy things
that happen there.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.701
I know there's been a lot
of mishaps over the years

13:59.703 --> 14:00.802
of people boating,

14:00.804 --> 14:02.971
people getting stranded
on Garden Island.

14:02.973 --> 14:04.673
And if you go just be
prepared that you won't

14:04.675 --> 14:06.743
come back the same.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.711
You'll never leave the same.

14:08.713 --> 14:12.414
A lot of the Ojibwe's that
lived on Beaver Island

14:12.416 --> 14:16.586
went to Garden specifically to
plant corn and squash though.

14:16.588 --> 14:20.726
They had a extensive
agricultural type society there.

14:21.693 --> 14:23.558
The odd thing is that

14:23.560 --> 14:26.562
there was a whole
other population of

14:26.564 --> 14:30.966
individuals that lived on the
opposite side of the island.

14:30.968 --> 14:31.801
They built a saw mill.

14:31.803 --> 14:34.473
They had a small town there.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.773
One of the questions we had

14:37.775 --> 14:39.408
was the fact that,

14:39.410 --> 14:42.213
did these people
live in harmony?

14:43.915 --> 14:45.581
Were there lines drawn?

14:45.583 --> 14:47.049
How the interactions happen.

14:47.051 --> 14:49.619
If there was any discontent

14:49.621 --> 14:51.053
that occurred on the island.

14:51.055 --> 14:53.022
Garden Island became
somewhat of a ghost town

14:53.024 --> 14:54.724
with a small pocket

14:54.726 --> 14:57.894
of native Ojibwe's still
living on the island

14:57.896 --> 14:59.995
but gradually they
started to just

14:59.997 --> 15:02.600
succumb to illness and by 1900

15:03.635 --> 15:06.836
most of the population
has dwindled.

15:06.838 --> 15:10.740
The last full time Native
American resident of the island

15:10.742 --> 15:12.942
was named Peter Monatou.

15:12.944 --> 15:16.379
He lived there
all by himself and

15:16.381 --> 15:18.748
ultimately he died in 1940.

15:18.750 --> 15:19.718
Since 1940,

15:20.819 --> 15:22.918
there hasn't been any
full time residents

15:22.920 --> 15:24.723
of the island itself.

15:28.892 --> 15:31.360
Four children from
Explorer Group 715,

15:31.362 --> 15:33.863
a youth mentorship program
based in Grand Rapids,

15:33.865 --> 15:35.764
were reported missing
from a small island

15:35.766 --> 15:37.734
located in northern
Lake Michigan.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.769
Law enforcement and search
and rescue groups were

15:39.771 --> 15:42.138
dispatched to investigate
the area where the children

15:42.140 --> 15:43.405
were last seen.

15:43.407 --> 15:45.607
When search and rescue
arrived on the island they

15:45.609 --> 15:47.610
reported that the group's
campsite was found

15:47.612 --> 15:48.977
undisturbed but abandoned.

15:48.979 --> 15:51.947
The search and rescue crew
remains on the island looking

15:51.949 --> 15:53.216
for the missing children

15:53.218 --> 15:55.518
and law enforcement officials
are investigating the

15:55.520 --> 15:56.952
whereabouts of these children

15:56.954 --> 15:59.489
as they find the incident
highly suspicious

15:59.491 --> 16:01.423
and suspect foul play.

16:01.425 --> 16:03.058
If you have information on
the whereabouts of these

16:03.060 --> 16:06.528
children you can call the
State Police anonymous tip line

16:06.530 --> 16:08.666
at area code 616-450-1537.

16:10.702 --> 16:13.068
[Chris] You must have
some kind of theory.

16:13.070 --> 16:13.939
Four kids

16:15.006 --> 16:16.806
just don't vanish

16:16.808 --> 16:20.409
and nobody ever found
anything from what I hear.

16:20.411 --> 16:21.477
I have no idea.

16:21.479 --> 16:22.711
I have no idea what
happened up there.

16:22.713 --> 16:24.147
There's some

16:24.149 --> 16:26.948
stuff about some Indian curse

16:26.950 --> 16:28.286
on the island.

16:30.588 --> 16:32.955
That's about all I know.

16:32.957 --> 16:35.691
I've had a lot of it
blocked from my mind.

16:35.693 --> 16:38.094
It's not a pleasant
part of my life.

16:38.096 --> 16:39.828
[Chris] Hi Mr.
Hammons hi this is Chris

16:39.830 --> 16:41.798
from Dogbyte Films we
talked on the phone.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.668
I had a couple questions
for you about the

16:45.670 --> 16:47.736
1989 trip to Garden Island.

16:47.738 --> 16:49.438
I just wondered if you could
tell me a little bit about

16:49.440 --> 16:51.410
what might of happened?

16:52.109 --> 16:53.109
What's with this.

16:53.111 --> 16:55.177
This like for
YouTube or something?

16:55.179 --> 16:57.447
[Chris] No we're
actually doing a full blown

16:57.449 --> 17:00.216
documentary about the
events of '89 and we really

17:00.218 --> 17:01.086
wanna know

17:02.319 --> 17:05.587
how you can have supervised
children on an island

17:05.589 --> 17:07.890
and they just kinda vanished.

17:07.892 --> 17:08.589
I don't know.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.126
We knew its history.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.097
Back in '61

17:13.630 --> 17:15.464
same thing happened.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.467
It was like Boy
Scouts or something.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.603
Just vanished.

17:19.935 --> 17:22.971
[Chris] Being an adult
and a supervisor roll do you

17:22.973 --> 17:25.108
feel somewhat responsible?

17:29.681 --> 17:30.882
They vanished

17:32.015 --> 17:33.849
without a trace.

17:33.851 --> 17:34.651
(door slamming)

17:34.653 --> 17:36.786
[Chris] There we have it.

17:36.788 --> 17:40.925
I think it's good for me
to go on this thing and

17:42.993 --> 17:46.063
try to see if there's
something else.

17:57.975 --> 18:01.176
I used to fish up at
Garden Island all the time.

18:01.178 --> 18:03.078
My friends and I would
go up there a lot,

18:03.080 --> 18:04.614
hell everyone was up there,

18:04.616 --> 18:07.583
and the fishing was
so fucking amazing

18:07.585 --> 18:10.185
that we used to refer
to it as success island.

18:10.187 --> 18:11.088
I'm fine.

18:14.725 --> 18:16.057
Maybe this will
help things for me.

18:16.059 --> 18:17.226
I don't know.

18:17.228 --> 18:20.128
Maybe you'll get some
closure on some things.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.696
Closure's bullshit.

18:21.698 --> 18:23.031
There is no closure.

18:23.033 --> 18:27.202
We'd heard about the reports
of the missing children.

18:27.204 --> 18:28.971
Everyone knew that there
was a pattern there because

18:28.973 --> 18:32.708
that was not the first
time it had happened.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.576
If you wanna talk to the
Indians they'll tell you

18:34.578 --> 18:36.077
all about it

18:36.079 --> 18:40.215
but I would just say
good luck finding one.

18:40.217 --> 18:41.616
It's just,

18:41.618 --> 18:45.988
there was something just very
menacing and creepy about it.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.156
I've got the sense to
stay away from there.

18:48.158 --> 18:51.560
We are packing to go up north.

18:51.562 --> 18:53.596
Once we get up there we're
going to get on a ferry

18:53.598 --> 18:54.763
to Garden Island.

18:54.765 --> 18:55.798
It's hard camping out there.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.667
This ain't

18:58.903 --> 19:00.036
a public camp ground.

19:00.038 --> 19:00.970
Nobody lives there.

19:00.972 --> 19:01.836
There's no water,

19:01.838 --> 19:02.805
no electricity.

19:02.807 --> 19:05.240
It's Colorado dude.

19:05.242 --> 19:06.308
(laughter)

19:06.310 --> 19:08.877
We have a Colorado map nice.

19:08.879 --> 19:12.682
The island is full of
mosquitoes and full of seven

19:12.684 --> 19:14.916
different species
of snakes coyotes.

19:14.918 --> 19:16.986
I'm at eight now.

19:16.988 --> 19:17.886
(beeping)

19:17.888 --> 19:18.954
That's two.

19:18.956 --> 19:20.056
The amateurs.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.258
When you point the compass north

19:22.260 --> 19:24.759
and then you know where you are.

19:24.761 --> 19:25.594
Wind-up flashlight,

19:25.596 --> 19:28.066
compass glow sticks tin cup.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.599
[Chuck] We go up
here by Charlevoix.

19:30.601 --> 19:32.268
Take the ferry to Beaver Island,

19:32.270 --> 19:33.402
which is up here,

19:33.404 --> 19:36.271
and then we actually
gotta take a private

19:36.273 --> 19:37.673
boat to get to Garden.

19:37.675 --> 19:38.740
Tons of flashlights.

19:38.742 --> 19:42.612
I probably got 20
flashlights with me.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.013
[Chuck] Blow dryer and
fingernail polish Sophia?

19:45.015 --> 19:46.848
Yeah we're gonna paint your
nails when you fall asleep.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.017
Your toe nails.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.219
(laughter)

19:50.221 --> 19:51.252
[Chris] What do we
got for food you guys?

19:51.254 --> 19:53.255
What are we eating?

19:53.257 --> 19:57.262
First aid kit complete
with IV and everything.

19:58.296 --> 20:00.232
This is a six man tent.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.399
[Chris] 'Cause we know
how you like multiple layers

20:03.401 --> 20:04.933
of men.

20:04.935 --> 20:05.803
I do.

20:06.637 --> 20:09.073
Are you filming me right now?

20:11.075 --> 20:12.077
Close hello.

20:13.176 --> 20:15.845
[Chris] Hello hello.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.145
God I wish I could do that.

20:17.147 --> 20:18.913
I'm jealous of your squeaking.

20:18.915 --> 20:20.715
[Chris] It's the
only talent I have.

20:20.717 --> 20:23.352
(laughter)

20:23.354 --> 20:25.957
I know I've seen your films.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.962
Look out fuckers
media coming through.

20:33.964 --> 20:34.696
I'm good.

20:34.698 --> 20:35.897
Plenty of trouble honey.

20:35.899 --> 20:36.598
(laughter)

20:36.600 --> 20:38.636
I have an entourage.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.941
What did you want?

20:45.710 --> 20:47.209
[Amy] Camel Crush.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.344
You can tell her.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.845
She would like Camel Crush.

20:49.847 --> 20:52.682
[Amy] You were asking me.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.286
Got some Camel Crush.

20:55.453 --> 20:57.385
[Chris] Have you put
in the cooler Sophie?

20:57.387 --> 20:59.689
You want them to drink it
and when we get up there

20:59.691 --> 21:00.890
it's gonna be gone.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.692
You guys can drink warm
then 'cause we're gonna

21:02.694 --> 21:03.826
have cold.

21:03.828 --> 21:05.326
[Chris] Lucky you.
It's booze cruisin'.

21:05.328 --> 21:06.194
[Chris] Lucky you.

21:06.196 --> 21:06.929
Booze cruise.

21:06.931 --> 21:07.596
[Sophia] Booze cruise.

21:07.598 --> 21:08.830
[Chris] I guess.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.031
Where are you?

21:10.033 --> 21:10.901
Tell me?

21:12.136 --> 21:13.238
Big Rapids.

21:14.238 --> 21:16.137
Pulled over to get some gas.

21:16.139 --> 21:18.173
[Chris] You got gas?

21:18.175 --> 21:20.976
Yeah and I filled
up the car too.

21:20.978 --> 21:21.844
[Sophia] So we're
probably about what,

21:21.846 --> 21:23.378
200 more miles?

21:23.380 --> 21:26.115
I don't know it was like
300 about five minutes ago.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.653
(rock music)

21:30.922 --> 21:32.253
I love this song.

21:32.255 --> 21:34.123
It is fucking awesome.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.458
It is.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.731
[Chris] It's like a really
kind of hippie influence.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.301
I could pop a
Quaalude right now.

21:46.303 --> 21:48.839
(rock music)

21:59.884 --> 22:03.018
I got a bottle of
diet cream soda Faygo

22:03.020 --> 22:05.153
style in the house.

22:05.155 --> 22:06.756
♪ Well it's an okay ♪

22:06.758 --> 22:09.391
♪ Evening for a drive ♪

22:09.393 --> 22:12.193
Chuck's going like a fuckin'
bat outta hell right now.

22:12.195 --> 22:14.797
(laughter)

22:14.799 --> 22:16.397
[Amy] He's speeding up
and then he'll slow down.

22:16.399 --> 22:17.465
I know.

22:17.467 --> 22:18.165
[Amy] Then when
you catch up with him

22:18.167 --> 22:20.301
he'll speed up again.

22:20.303 --> 22:22.771
He's got a really
odd driving pattern.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.240
He's competitive,

22:24.242 --> 22:25.274
lazy driving.

22:25.276 --> 22:27.175
It's kind of a
combination of both.

22:27.177 --> 22:28.646
Your GPS lied.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.482
[Chris] We were going in
the wrong direction for what,

22:34.484 --> 22:36.085
10 15 minutes?

22:36.087 --> 22:37.355
No like three.

22:38.455 --> 22:40.221
[Chris] Oh it seemed
like 10 minutes.

22:40.223 --> 22:42.024
Is it this thing here?

22:42.026 --> 22:42.691
I guess.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.292
[Chuck] It lies!

22:44.294 --> 22:47.395
We are in Charlevoix and it is

22:47.397 --> 22:50.432
11:00 p.m. at night
and we made it up here.

22:50.434 --> 22:53.169
It was a nice little
detour we took there.

22:53.171 --> 22:54.237
(laughter)

22:54.239 --> 22:57.272
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:57.274 --> 23:00.476
[Chris] It was the Magellan.

23:00.478 --> 23:03.077
[Amy] You guys are
nice and (mumbles) huh?

23:03.079 --> 23:04.413
That'll wet your whistle.

23:04.415 --> 23:07.883
[Chris] This is our
paranormal expert.

23:07.885 --> 23:11.452
Over here we have
Mrs. Sophia Maslowski.

23:11.454 --> 23:12.821
Nice to meet you.

23:12.823 --> 23:14.088
[Chris] Boom mic,

23:14.090 --> 23:14.756
sound stuff,

23:14.758 --> 23:15.457
some camera stuff,

23:15.459 --> 23:17.425
some interview stuff.

23:17.427 --> 23:18.460
Here we have Chuckster.

23:18.462 --> 23:19.528
How you doing?
If you heard about Chuck

23:19.530 --> 23:22.163
he's one of the
original members of the

23:22.165 --> 23:24.232
original expedition in '89.

23:24.234 --> 23:26.935
We have Amy who's gonna be
helping with cameras and

23:26.937 --> 23:27.869
sound equipment and stuff.

23:27.871 --> 23:29.438
Hi Amy hi.
Nice to meet you.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.573
[Chris] How do you feel?

23:30.575 --> 23:33.843
Alright (foreign language)

23:33.845 --> 23:35.176
[Chris] We got this one
bouncing off the walls.

23:35.178 --> 23:36.511
Her Adderall's obviously

23:36.513 --> 23:37.579
- kicking in.
- [Sophia] No I haven't taken

23:37.581 --> 23:40.819
any Adderall I'm just
tired of sitting.

23:42.619 --> 23:44.519
(door shutting)

23:44.521 --> 23:46.221
[Chris] Good morning.

23:46.223 --> 23:48.022
It's like a half mile down

23:48.024 --> 23:48.990
that way.
It's a half mile down and

23:48.992 --> 23:50.395
there's a shuttle.

23:53.097 --> 23:55.130
We gotta get crackin'.

23:55.132 --> 23:57.402
Don't grab my lucky charm.

23:58.903 --> 24:00.068
Like it means nothing.

24:00.070 --> 24:03.742
[Amy] This is a very
personal item for me.

25:11.675 --> 25:12.674
It's weird.

25:12.676 --> 25:15.644
It's like going
back in time 'cause

25:15.646 --> 25:16.511
nothing has changed.

25:16.513 --> 25:18.480
It all looks exactly the same.

25:18.482 --> 25:21.016
[Sophia] What we're going
to do is Amy brought some

25:21.018 --> 25:22.084
burlap and

25:22.086 --> 25:23.484
some twine.

25:23.486 --> 25:26.488
We're gonna take the burlap
and I'm gonna grab a cigarette

25:26.490 --> 25:29.357
from one of you guys
and take it apart,

25:29.359 --> 25:32.161
put the tobacco in it
because that was one of the

25:32.163 --> 25:34.963
standard gifts that
was given was tobacco.

25:34.965 --> 25:38.433
[John] Garden Island is used
as a meeting place for the

25:38.435 --> 25:40.301
Native American Indians.

25:40.303 --> 25:40.969
Also important

25:40.971 --> 25:42.171
as a burial spot,

25:42.173 --> 25:43.441
it's the largest

25:44.341 --> 25:46.709
Native American burial ground

25:46.711 --> 25:49.478
pretty much in the Great Lakes.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.278
(mumbles)

25:50.280 --> 25:54.085
[Amy] Cheers to (mumbles)

25:56.052 --> 25:56.920
We'll see.

25:58.222 --> 26:01.190
I looked for three missing
people right about here

26:01.192 --> 26:02.393
for three days.

26:03.493 --> 26:05.326
We lost three of our

26:05.328 --> 26:09.064
local people here in
a fishing accident.

26:09.066 --> 26:12.367
A lot of tragedy
that happens here.

26:12.369 --> 26:13.537
I don't know.

26:14.905 --> 26:18.406
There's a lot of mixed stuff
going on in here right now.

26:18.408 --> 26:19.510
I don't know.

26:22.279 --> 26:25.547
A lot of things are coming back.

26:25.549 --> 26:28.717
We're gonna do a
three person kind of.

26:28.719 --> 26:29.817
Yes Chris

26:29.819 --> 26:31.019
the man of reason.
What am I hopping on?

26:31.021 --> 26:34.490
[John] Step and then
to the deck you'll go.

26:34.492 --> 26:36.094
[Chuck] Fat man.

26:37.261 --> 26:39.528
It's your color.
No comment.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.266
[Chris] Smart ass.

26:42.366 --> 26:45.036
It's your color though Chuck.

26:56.414 --> 26:57.413
Are you talking
about right there

26:57.415 --> 26:59.181
where it's taped?

26:59.183 --> 27:01.083
[Sophia] We just
had to tape it.

27:01.085 --> 27:02.084
[Amy] The second I put it up

27:02.086 --> 27:03.751
it snapped.
It's too tight because

27:03.753 --> 27:05.019
we can't zip this.

27:05.021 --> 27:08.790
Can hear sound but just
not through the headphones.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.526
Alright now I've got sound.

27:10.528 --> 27:12.664
(singing)

27:13.664 --> 27:14.496
[Chris] Is that a real song?

27:14.498 --> 27:16.198
♪ I won't have to talk ♪

27:16.200 --> 27:17.399
♪ No more ♪

27:17.401 --> 27:20.402
There's spirit houses and

27:20.404 --> 27:22.403
they're supposed to
be live and active.

27:22.405 --> 27:23.505
A lot of people don't
want to come here

27:23.507 --> 27:24.806
because it's haunted.

27:24.808 --> 27:27.142
What we're hoping to do
here today is to possibly

27:27.144 --> 27:29.711
document paranormal activity.

27:29.713 --> 27:33.182
We're hoping from some of
the Indian natives from here.

27:33.184 --> 27:35.851
I'm Dan Holroyd I am the
founder and president of

27:35.853 --> 27:38.220
SMP Southern
Michigan Paranormals.

27:38.222 --> 27:41.423
I'm in cooperation with Nicole

27:41.425 --> 27:43.858
out here to help do some
paranormal investigating

27:43.860 --> 27:47.362
of the Native American
sites on the island

27:47.364 --> 27:50.365
as well as assist
with your crew.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.500
I have Ojibwe in my family.

27:52.502 --> 27:54.502
My great-grandmother was Ojibwe.

27:54.504 --> 27:55.570
This is an EMF,

27:55.572 --> 27:57.240
standard EMF meter.

27:58.675 --> 28:01.509
We have a natural electromagnetic
field around the earth

28:01.511 --> 28:04.246
and around most
everything around us.

28:04.248 --> 28:06.414
This will detect
changes in that field.

28:06.416 --> 28:08.884
The theory is in
paranormal investigating,

28:08.886 --> 28:12.320
is that when we have
something that interferes on a

28:12.322 --> 28:14.655
medium to large scale
when there's no other

28:14.657 --> 28:16.491
power source around,

28:16.493 --> 28:19.494
both of these are designed to,

28:19.496 --> 28:22.196
as you see with this one
with the dummy gauge on it,

28:22.198 --> 28:24.566
they are to monitor
that and they will

28:24.568 --> 28:26.768
also show you that there's
interference in that

28:26.770 --> 28:28.237
magnetic field.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.038
Spray yourself heavily.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.376
Don't drink it or nothing.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.678
No one wants to get
sick or get bit by some

28:36.680 --> 28:38.614
God awful bugs so

28:38.616 --> 28:39.815
be sure you have
all that shit ready.

28:39.817 --> 28:41.517
I want to go to my tent
and get mine right now.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.817
We stopped at the liquor store,

28:42.819 --> 28:43.919
get the booze,

28:43.921 --> 28:45.086
and then he's been
drinking beer beer beer.

28:45.088 --> 28:48.856
Then on the ferry ride
here he's been drinking.

28:48.858 --> 28:50.925
He's had probably eight
beers since we've been here.

28:50.927 --> 28:55.196
We've only been here what an
hour trying to set up camp?

28:55.198 --> 28:59.167
I gotta keep up
appearances don't I Craig?

28:59.169 --> 29:01.502
[Chris] Now I'm
really insulted.

29:01.504 --> 29:02.538
Whatever the fuck your name is.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.672
I don't know.

29:03.674 --> 29:04.839
[Chris] We're going
deep into the woods.

29:04.841 --> 29:07.843
Can I have everybody do
a radio check please?

29:07.845 --> 29:09.278
Radio check.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.278
[Amy] I need to get my radio.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.380
You got my radio check?

29:11.382 --> 29:13.518
(beeping)

29:16.419 --> 29:18.452
[Chris] You guys
got your meters?

29:18.454 --> 29:19.688
Everybody's got their radios?

29:19.690 --> 29:20.388
Good to go?

29:20.390 --> 29:21.256
[Chuck] Good to go.

29:21.258 --> 29:24.726
[Chris] Let's go bucko water.

29:24.728 --> 29:25.894
(mysterious noise)

29:25.896 --> 29:28.196
Did you guys here that
in the woods over here?

29:28.198 --> 29:29.330
Look over here.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.731
[Dan] I just had a
spike right here too.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.467
[Chris] No shit?

29:32.469 --> 29:34.469
Shoot your camera that way Amy.

29:34.471 --> 29:35.336
[Amy] What way?
Over in the woods

29:35.338 --> 29:36.307
right here.

29:37.207 --> 29:38.540
Did you hear that?

29:38.542 --> 29:40.474
[Chuck] Probably just a
animal or something Chris.

29:40.476 --> 29:42.911
[Chris] Why's your
exposure level down?

29:42.913 --> 29:44.378
[Nicole] Did we get any
type of hits there Dan?

29:44.380 --> 29:45.079
[Dan] I did right there.

29:45.081 --> 29:46.850
[Nicole] Down here?

29:48.918 --> 29:50.655
[Dan] Going there.

29:51.821 --> 29:53.622
[Chris] I wouldn't
recommend that.

29:53.624 --> 29:54.623
Stick to the trail.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.359
Don't get separated.

29:57.694 --> 30:00.628
[Nicole] I'm not
hearing anything any more.

30:00.630 --> 30:03.832
It's probably just an animal.

30:03.834 --> 30:04.799
[Amy] Buzzing animal?

30:04.801 --> 30:06.803
[Chuck] Are you ready?

30:08.271 --> 30:09.238
[Chris] You guys are
documenting this stuff right?

30:09.240 --> 30:11.640
This means something.

30:11.642 --> 30:12.740
[Nicole] Alright let's go.

30:12.742 --> 30:13.874
[Chuck] Are we ready?

30:13.876 --> 30:14.909
[Nicole] I'm ready.

30:14.911 --> 30:17.515
[Amy] Are you
still getting it?

30:19.916 --> 30:22.252
(singing)

30:28.392 --> 30:29.124
[Chuck] It's these trees man.

30:29.126 --> 30:30.659
These trees are freaky.

30:30.661 --> 30:32.260
♪ The sun ♪

30:32.262 --> 30:33.362
♪ And the sun ♪

30:33.364 --> 30:35.396

30:35.398 --> 30:38.366
That's (mumbles) me
out man big time.

30:38.368 --> 30:39.634
[Chris] I'm
getting interference

30:39.636 --> 30:41.803
periods of (zapping noise)
which I never get on,

30:41.805 --> 30:42.804
these are Sennheiser mics.

30:42.806 --> 30:44.642
They're pretty clean.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.415
Are we all together now?

30:54.818 --> 30:58.053
[Chris] Got a big
fly on your back dude.

30:58.055 --> 31:00.521
[Man Black Shirt] What
the fuck you doing here?

31:00.523 --> 31:02.691
Get the fuck outta here!

31:02.693 --> 31:04.425

31:09.367 --> 31:10.465

fuck you doing dude?

31:12.569 --> 31:15.336
You shut the fuck up and
shut that camera off.

31:15.338 --> 31:16.904
[Amy] Get that
gun out of my face!

31:16.906 --> 31:18.507
[Chris] This is
state property man.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.708
We have the right to be here

31:19.710 --> 31:20.909

No you don't!

31:20.911 --> 31:21.977

31:30.453 --> 31:31.319
[Chris] We're
making a documentary.

32:00.783 --> 32:02.451
We'll circle around.

32:02.453 --> 32:03.951

Sophia come back here.

32:08.425 --> 32:09.624
Stop stop just

32:09.626 --> 32:11.058
You can't let her go.

32:11.060 --> 32:11.992
Do not let her go.

32:11.994 --> 32:14.563
We can't abandon
anybody up here.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.367
Sophia get back here.

32:17.501 --> 32:20.538
We'll just bypass
them from now on.

32:21.805 --> 32:22.871
Let's go.

32:22.873 --> 32:24.005
[Chris] You alright?

32:24.007 --> 32:25.707
You alright?

32:25.709 --> 32:27.375
Everything's good?

32:27.377 --> 32:28.576
Everything's good.

32:28.578 --> 32:30.412
[Chris] Dude I'm shaking.

32:30.414 --> 32:31.779
That scared the
fuck out of me man.

32:31.781 --> 32:32.580
[Chuck] You're
not the only one.

32:32.582 --> 32:33.848
[Chris] I'm freaking out.

32:33.850 --> 32:34.883
We're all shaking.

32:34.885 --> 32:36.550
[Chuck] Can we
just keep walking?

32:36.552 --> 32:37.486
[Chris] I don't know hold on.

32:37.488 --> 32:38.519
Let's just regroup.

32:38.521 --> 32:39.188
I don't wanna go
anywhere right now.

32:39.190 --> 32:40.857
I'm sorry you guys.

32:43.793 --> 32:45.993
You just told me to stop
crying and you start crying.

32:45.995 --> 32:46.728
[Chris] Think of it man,

32:46.730 --> 32:47.929
it's a family business.

32:47.931 --> 32:51.566
This has probably been
going on for 20 years.

32:51.568 --> 32:53.734
[Chuck] All this
mesh shit is new.

32:53.736 --> 32:56.171
Pot farmers and stuff
here would be really cool

32:56.173 --> 32:57.405
and mellow.

32:57.407 --> 32:58.440
No one comes up here.

32:58.442 --> 32:59.607
They're not gonna
need guns and shit.

32:59.609 --> 33:02.810
They were cooking meth
and it wasn't up here

33:02.812 --> 33:04.179
when I was up here.

33:04.181 --> 33:06.515
We're indi right?

33:06.517 --> 33:08.386
Indian Harbor correct?

33:09.787 --> 33:11.853
What I'm seeing here
is the little trail,

33:11.855 --> 33:13.457
that's that trail.

33:15.125 --> 33:17.025
Didn't the guy from the
boat say we turn left

33:17.027 --> 33:19.760
it's gonna y off
and we turn left

33:19.762 --> 33:21.563
to get up to the
Indian burial ground

33:21.565 --> 33:25.099
and then we hang a
right at that oak tree.

33:25.101 --> 33:27.669
Look what's sitting
where we're at.

33:27.671 --> 33:29.637
It says a site of
Indian village.

33:29.639 --> 33:32.642
(branches snapping)

33:48.559 --> 33:49.223
[Chuck] That's weird shit.

33:49.225 --> 33:51.460
I'm getting creepy.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.864
[Amy] Is somebody out there?

33:55.665 --> 33:58.200
Let's not draw attention.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.806
It's probably just an
animal or something.

34:04.174 --> 34:06.540
[Chris] I heard
something out there.

34:06.542 --> 34:07.342
[Chuck] Let's keep walking.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.612
It's around here somewhere.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.581
[Chris] You guys
don't hear that?

34:13.583 --> 34:15.351
[Chuck] I heard it.

34:16.752 --> 34:17.618
(branches cracking)

34:17.620 --> 34:18.351
[Amy] What the hell is that?

34:18.353 --> 34:19.587
[Chris] Right there.

34:19.589 --> 34:20.456
Up ahead.

34:23.025 --> 34:24.091
[Nicole] Hey guys
can you come over here?

34:24.092 --> 34:27.828
I think I might have
found something.

34:27.830 --> 34:30.498
Yeah we're on our way right now.

34:30.501 --> 34:31.299
[Chris] Where is she?

34:31.301 --> 34:32.801
[Sophia] Where are you?

34:32.803 --> 34:34.638
You went ahead of us.

34:35.938 --> 34:37.804
[Nicole] Come on through
the trail and it curves around

34:37.806 --> 34:39.572
to the right and
just keep going.

34:39.574 --> 34:40.710
You'll see me.

34:42.513 --> 34:43.212
[Chris] Come and
shoot this Amy.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.045
Take a shot of this.

34:45.047 --> 34:46.915
Get this.
What is it?

34:46.917 --> 34:48.850
[Nicole] I don't know yet
I haven't gotten it out.

34:48.851 --> 34:50.453
[Chris] Hold on.

34:56.292 --> 34:58.162
This is Jimmy's hat.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.196
[Chris] That's evidence man.

35:02.198 --> 35:04.533
You should put that back.

35:04.535 --> 35:06.868
It's not gonna have fucking
fingerprints on a hat

35:06.870 --> 35:09.738
that's 20 something
years old Chris.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.540
There's no reason
to put it back.

35:11.542 --> 35:15.009
They're not gonna dust for
prints on this thing anymore.

35:15.011 --> 35:17.745
[Chris] Let me do a quick
narration on what we found

35:17.747 --> 35:21.216
so put it back at
least so I can do that.

35:21.218 --> 35:25.287
Here we are it's June 15th
and we're on Garden Island

35:25.289 --> 35:28.790
and about two two and a
half miles into the trail.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.792
We took a fork in the trail,

35:30.794 --> 35:32.060
Nicole calls us,

35:32.062 --> 35:35.800
we find this hat which
appears to be the hat from

35:37.633 --> 35:41.303
Jimmy Barnes from the
expedition in 1989.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.270
Let's just go right now alright?

35:43.272 --> 35:46.040
We found the camp site.

35:46.042 --> 35:47.107
Now we know where it is.

35:47.109 --> 35:48.709
You're on film.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.114
[Sophia] I'm so sorry Chuck.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.115
Can we go?

35:54.117 --> 35:55.450
Yippee we found a hat.

35:55.452 --> 35:57.618
We found a fucking old hat.
Do you know which way back?

35:57.620 --> 35:58.819
From where we came from yes.

35:58.821 --> 35:59.888
Let's go.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.926
Just go follow the
trail down there.

36:08.832 --> 36:11.100
We were really into them and

36:12.803 --> 36:14.205
he was a good kid.

36:15.906 --> 36:17.772
Me and Jimmy did a
lot of shit together.

36:17.774 --> 36:19.777
He was the only one that

36:21.877 --> 36:24.714
didn't fucking
tease me and shit.

36:28.151 --> 36:31.886
[Chris] Do you feel
like we need to move on?

36:31.888 --> 36:33.020
Do you want to
continue this project?

36:33.022 --> 36:34.756
Yeah I wanna know what
happened to Jimmy.

36:34.758 --> 36:36.156
I'm just gonna be here a while.

36:36.158 --> 36:37.691
[Amy] Are we gonna

36:37.693 --> 36:39.160
just wait here for him then?

36:39.162 --> 36:40.328
[Chris] No just go just go.

36:40.330 --> 36:41.196
It's over.

36:41.198 --> 36:42.665
Just let him be.

36:44.767 --> 36:45.903
One more take.

36:48.037 --> 36:49.506
Expedition 2012.

36:51.207 --> 36:53.841
Starting out kind of rough.

36:53.843 --> 36:56.012
We did get ambushed by some

36:57.680 --> 36:58.682
really angry

37:00.182 --> 37:03.183
guys with some really
big guns and that was

37:03.185 --> 37:04.317
some pretty decent footage.

37:04.319 --> 37:07.656
Especially watching
the crew react to that.

37:07.658 --> 37:10.158
Also found the original
camp site and some suspected

37:10.160 --> 37:12.926
evidence which was a red hat

37:12.928 --> 37:17.298
which looks like one of
the original campers.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.134
Hopefully we'll have
something to put together

37:20.136 --> 37:22.236
for this project,

37:22.238 --> 37:23.307
again hoping,

37:24.307 --> 37:25.642
but we'll see.

37:34.216 --> 37:36.619
(crickets)

37:44.861 --> 37:47.665
(birds chirping)

37:49.700 --> 37:52.200
[Amy] He's here but.
Easy now.

37:52.202 --> 37:53.468
Easy now.

37:53.470 --> 37:55.904
I'd like to thank the academy.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.238
(laughter)

37:57.240 --> 37:58.807
Thank you so much.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.975
(laughter)

38:00.977 --> 38:02.008
[Chris] It's a GoPro.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.778
I couldn't have
done it without you.

38:03.780 --> 38:04.979
Thank you.

38:04.981 --> 38:06.814
If I'm forgetting anybody's
names I'm so sorry.

38:06.816 --> 38:07.982
Thank you I love you.

38:07.984 --> 38:09.718
Thank you.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.953
[Chris] You know how
to turn that thing on?

38:11.955 --> 38:14.189
(laughter)

38:14.191 --> 38:15.823
[Amy] The on button.

38:15.825 --> 38:16.991
[Chris] It's just
like a regular camera.

38:16.993 --> 38:18.158
You push that button.

38:18.160 --> 38:18.959
[Chuck] You talk dirty to it.

38:18.961 --> 38:21.129
[Chris] And it'll beep.

38:21.131 --> 38:22.830
When you want to roll
just hit the top one.

38:22.832 --> 38:24.732
That's the shutter release.

38:24.734 --> 38:28.004
When we go to bed at
night that goes on.

38:44.287 --> 38:45.086
It's third grade,

38:45.088 --> 38:47.256
third fourth grade humor.

38:49.126 --> 38:50.892
[Chris] We don't expect
anything more from you.

38:50.894 --> 38:51.859
Fuck off Penny.

38:51.861 --> 38:52.593
(laughter)
Stay behind the camera.

38:52.595 --> 38:53.761
Quit fucking commenting.

38:53.763 --> 38:56.363
[Amy] I think you're
building it way up Chuck

38:56.365 --> 38:57.499
so just tell the joke.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.366
[Chuck] No fuck it.

38:58.368 --> 38:59.433
Joke's done.

38:59.435 --> 39:00.502
(laughter)

39:00.504 --> 39:02.904
I'll just give it
a punchline then.

39:02.906 --> 39:04.171
The punchline is,

39:04.173 --> 39:05.439
I looked all over my hairy
butt hole but I can't

39:05.441 --> 39:06.408
find my crack.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.075
There's your punchline.
(laughter)

39:08.077 --> 39:10.178
Make your own fucking joke.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.513
Thank you very much.

39:11.515 --> 39:15.917
Boy humor and girl humor at
that age are so different.

39:15.919 --> 39:19.087
I don't even remember
what we thought was funny

39:19.089 --> 39:22.256
but it wasn't that
kind of stuff.

39:22.258 --> 39:24.125
I don't remember
girls being funny at

39:24.127 --> 39:24.859
third and fourth grade.

39:24.861 --> 39:26.461
They were all bitches.

39:26.463 --> 39:28.962
(laughter)

39:28.964 --> 39:30.999
I said my punchline
you give a punchline.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.834
[Amy] You can't
even remember the joke

39:32.836 --> 39:34.301
you fucking joke.

39:34.303 --> 39:36.537
(laughter)

39:36.539 --> 39:39.006
[Chris] If you want to cue
me in on the punching thing.

39:39.008 --> 39:40.107
(laughter)

39:40.109 --> 39:42.843
[Amy] Oh he's gotta
go punch his clown.

39:42.845 --> 39:43.778
I don't like to hear

39:43.780 --> 39:45.946
squishy soft sounds
(laughter)

39:45.948 --> 39:47.917
all fucking night long.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.756
I'll take watch
tonight you guys.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.430
Alright let's do this thing.

40:05.035 --> 40:07.905
Take care of your
bottles fuckers.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.609
Are you gonna film me all night
or you going to sleep Chris?

40:15.611 --> 40:19.513
[Chris] I'm going to sleep
after you get situated.

40:19.515 --> 40:22.283
[Amy] What do you want
to film us doing in here?

40:22.285 --> 40:23.886
I thought Chris,

40:25.055 --> 40:26.888
what if they come
behind me (laughs)

40:26.890 --> 40:27.988
I'm fucked.

40:27.990 --> 40:28.790
[Chris] Actually
quite literally yes.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.991
Push the shutter release.

40:30.993 --> 40:34.127
[Chuck] Which is the top one?

40:34.129 --> 40:34.861
[Chris] I don't know.

40:34.863 --> 40:35.930
[Chuck] Do you know?

40:35.932 --> 40:39.102
[Chris] Try it and
see what happens.

40:40.537 --> 40:42.002
[Chuck] Red light on

40:42.004 --> 40:43.136
mean recording.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.341
(crickets)

41:01.925 --> 41:05.028
[Mysterious Voice]
Over here Chuck.

41:08.899 --> 41:10.167
Chuck over here.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.171
Over here Chuck.

41:23.613 --> 41:26.350
[Chris] You guys see anything?

41:28.084 --> 41:29.082
[Nicole] No I can't
find him anywhere.

41:29.084 --> 41:30.685
I haven't seen him.

41:30.687 --> 41:32.356
He's not over here.

41:36.258 --> 41:38.394
[Chris] Sophia anything?

41:39.528 --> 41:40.194
[Sophia] No I've been
looking everywhere.

41:40.196 --> 41:41.932
I cannot find him.

41:43.066 --> 41:44.232
It's really black out here.

41:44.234 --> 41:47.571
I'm calling him
everything's no response.

41:49.238 --> 41:53.607
[Chris] You guys might
wanna come down here.

41:53.609 --> 41:56.209
[Nicole] Me and Sophia
are gonna meet up and

41:56.211 --> 41:59.013
we'll be down there in a minute.

41:59.015 --> 42:01.281
[Sophia] Tell me if I'm
going north south east or west

42:01.283 --> 42:03.153
'cause I have no idea.

42:04.254 --> 42:06.924
[Chris] Head
towards the water.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.196
[Sophia] I'm on my way.

42:16.365 --> 42:18.533
[Chris] You were standing
here that whole time?

42:18.535 --> 42:20.000
I don't know Chris.

42:20.002 --> 42:21.602
Fucking I don't know.

42:21.604 --> 42:22.903
[Chris] What do you
mean you don't know?

42:22.905 --> 42:25.105
How do you not know how
long you were standing here?

42:25.107 --> 42:26.140
Dude we were calling you,

42:26.142 --> 42:27.140
we were yelling
we were radioing,

42:27.142 --> 42:29.243
and you didn't
have your radio on.

42:29.245 --> 42:30.276
I don't know Chris.

42:30.278 --> 42:32.980
I don't know how
long I was there.

42:32.982 --> 42:34.015
Where the fuck
are you taking me?

42:34.017 --> 42:34.749
[Chris] I don't know.

42:34.751 --> 42:35.616
I don't know.

42:35.618 --> 42:36.649
I don't know!

42:36.651 --> 42:39.856
I don't know where
the fuck we are.

42:48.198 --> 42:51.268
We're getting the
fuck out of here.

42:53.102 --> 42:54.669
As predicted it's raining.

42:54.671 --> 42:56.104
It's been raining
all fucking day.

42:56.106 --> 42:57.104
I'm stuck in a tent.

42:57.106 --> 42:58.605
Everybody's bitching
and whining.

42:58.607 --> 43:00.707
Tent's leaking of course.

43:00.709 --> 43:02.676
Hasn't rained in two weeks but

43:02.678 --> 43:07.647
the day I bring all my shit
out it's fucking pouring.

43:07.649 --> 43:09.185
No story nothing.

43:10.086 --> 43:12.289
Then weird shit with Chuck.

43:13.722 --> 43:17.558
Found him standing
underneath a tree last night

43:17.560 --> 43:20.328
decorated with feathers

43:20.330 --> 43:22.430
tied to the branches.

43:22.432 --> 43:23.533
No doubt from

43:24.466 --> 43:25.700
the guys have been stalking us,

43:25.702 --> 43:27.435
some kind of scare tactic.

43:27.437 --> 43:28.301
I don't care.

43:28.303 --> 43:29.736
I'm not afraid.

43:29.738 --> 43:32.807
If they wanted to kill us they
had plenty of opportunities.

43:32.809 --> 43:36.477
I'm more interested now in
just getting to the cemetery,

43:36.479 --> 43:38.446
getting the paranormal
people up there,

43:38.448 --> 43:42.082
getting some EVP
readings whatever.

43:42.084 --> 43:43.086
I'll be back

43:44.586 --> 43:47.154
tomorrow hopefully to

43:47.156 --> 43:48.292
fill you in on

43:49.191 --> 43:51.459
what we find if anything.

43:51.461 --> 43:53.597
(raining)

44:08.410 --> 44:10.012
[Amy] Hey Chuck.

44:13.383 --> 44:14.582
Do you know where we are?

44:14.584 --> 44:15.716
[Chuck] Yes I know where I am.

44:15.718 --> 44:17.486
[Amy] Are you sure?

44:18.620 --> 44:21.089
[Chris] I think
we're going in circles.

44:21.091 --> 44:23.290
I'm seeing the same shit.

44:23.292 --> 44:24.625
They're a bunch of trees Chris.

44:24.627 --> 44:25.660
[Nicole] Yeah they
all look the same.

44:25.662 --> 44:27.627
[Amy] No seriously,

44:27.629 --> 44:28.796
do you know where we're going?

44:28.798 --> 44:32.135
[Chris] We've been
walking for six hours.

44:33.769 --> 44:36.370
[Amy] Do either of you
guys know what's going on?

44:36.372 --> 44:37.872
Do you know where you're going?

44:37.874 --> 44:38.673
[Chris] I don't.

44:38.675 --> 44:39.339
I don't know where I'm at.

44:39.341 --> 44:40.441
I can't see shit.

44:40.443 --> 44:41.142
It's been 20 something
years since I've

44:41.144 --> 44:41.942
been up here alright.

44:41.944 --> 44:44.245
Cut me some fucking slack.

44:44.247 --> 44:45.515
[Amy] Come on.

44:46.515 --> 44:47.647
[Chris] What do we wanna do?

44:47.649 --> 44:49.783
You wanna go forward
or you wanna go back?

44:49.785 --> 44:52.386
If we go back we're gonna get
more lost if we go forward

44:52.388 --> 44:53.787
who knows.
No let's go forward.

44:53.789 --> 44:55.388
[Chris] Probably end
up coming back here

44:55.390 --> 44:56.524
in a half an hour.

44:56.526 --> 44:59.127
Like we've been doing.

44:59.129 --> 45:02.562
[Sophia] There's
a stump right here.

45:02.564 --> 45:04.568
[Chris] You guys okay?

45:06.702 --> 45:10.303
[Amy] He didn't want
to even go and check.

45:10.305 --> 45:11.671
[Chuck] Can you shut your
mouth just for a second?

45:11.673 --> 45:12.541
Come on.

45:16.211 --> 45:19.412
[Amy] He's getting us lost.

45:19.414 --> 45:23.552
[Chris] Chill out let's
just get the hell out of here.

45:25.555 --> 45:28.125
We're getting up to a three

45:29.559 --> 45:31.160
and it's going up.

45:33.595 --> 45:34.794
[Chris] Can you

45:34.796 --> 45:36.363
explain that in layman's terms?

45:36.365 --> 45:38.598
Basically we should
have less than a one

45:38.600 --> 45:40.834
for normal reading
and up to a three,

45:40.836 --> 45:43.537
that signifies a
strong disturbance

45:43.539 --> 45:45.673
in the magnetic field.

45:45.675 --> 45:47.941
[Sophia] Is that a
positive or a negative?

45:47.943 --> 45:49.544
This strong?

45:49.546 --> 45:51.812
Negative probably.

45:51.814 --> 45:54.714
This strong we are probably
getting either close to

45:54.716 --> 45:57.919
something or being surrounded.

45:57.921 --> 46:01.221
[Chris] We're in a
Ojibwe Indian cemetery

46:01.223 --> 46:02.622
on Garden Island.

46:02.624 --> 46:04.591
We've been walking for hours
and hours and hours and it's

46:04.593 --> 46:06.861
been rumored that the
Indians that reside in this

46:06.863 --> 46:10.865
cemetery were decimated
by the smallpox virus

46:10.867 --> 46:13.734
which was introduced
to them by the

46:13.736 --> 46:15.736
white population that settled

46:15.738 --> 46:17.571
in this area.

46:17.573 --> 46:20.776
What we have here is
a field of graves.

46:22.312 --> 46:23.477
[Sophia] This is
not a good idea.

46:23.479 --> 46:26.216
[Amy] I don't want to do this.

46:27.617 --> 46:29.015
[Chris] We came all this way,

46:29.017 --> 46:30.984
spent all this time in the woods
and you're gonna turn back?

46:30.986 --> 46:32.919
[Sophia] She knows this
stuff and she's saying this

46:32.921 --> 46:34.087
doesn't feel good.

46:34.089 --> 46:35.855
[Nicole] I don't think
we should go in there.

46:35.857 --> 46:37.857
This high of reading
something is wrong.

46:37.859 --> 46:38.993
[Sophia] They're paranormals.

46:38.995 --> 46:40.828
They know what they're doing.

46:40.830 --> 46:42.997
[Chris] Do you guys want
to make this film or not?

46:42.999 --> 46:44.031
Do you wanna make this fuckin'

46:44.033 --> 46:45.066
movie or not?
We have been making this

46:45.068 --> 46:47.500
movie I don't feel
good about this.

46:47.502 --> 46:49.470
[Chuck] The day time's
different than at night.

46:49.472 --> 46:50.638
[Dan] I just want to
be really careful Chris

46:50.640 --> 46:54.778
I don't want to disturb
any of these (mumbles)

46:58.548 --> 47:00.982
I don't wanna be here anymore.

47:00.984 --> 47:04.651
I don't even know what
direction to go in anymore.

47:04.653 --> 47:06.386
I seriously don't know what
direction we're supposed

47:06.388 --> 47:08.124
to be going anymore.

47:09.258 --> 47:10.790
I don't know where we are.

47:10.792 --> 47:11.625
[Dan] It's okay Amy.

47:11.627 --> 47:14.328
We came in right over there.

47:14.330 --> 47:17.732
[Chris] Hello can you
guys hear me out there?

47:17.734 --> 47:18.735
Radio check.

47:27.676 --> 47:30.814
[Chuck] For you
and the guest Chuck.

47:40.589 --> 47:42.290
[Sophia] Amy I'm
not going over there.

47:42.292 --> 47:43.823
I'm not going there.

47:43.825 --> 47:45.526
[Chuck] We're
going right here.

47:45.528 --> 47:47.560
There's a path right there.

47:47.562 --> 47:51.665
Chris we gotta leave a
offering or something.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.602
[Chris] Yeah I agree.

47:54.736 --> 47:58.471
[Chuck] Let's go ask
Dan and Nicole what

47:58.473 --> 47:59.807
specifically we gotta do.

47:59.809 --> 48:00.508
[Amy] Hold on.

48:00.510 --> 48:02.310
Can we get it again?

48:02.312 --> 48:03.144
[Chris] Come on.

48:03.146 --> 48:04.979
[Chuck] It wasn't a fluke.

48:04.981 --> 48:05.979
[Chris] Come on.

48:05.981 --> 48:07.214
[Amy] It's gone.

48:07.216 --> 48:08.316
[Nicole] It's gone
okay as soon as we get it

48:08.318 --> 48:10.317
we'll yell for you.
The goosebumps again

48:10.319 --> 48:11.921
just walking up here.

48:14.557 --> 48:15.656
You see this shit?

48:15.658 --> 48:17.325
[Chris] Is that real?
Can you see that?

48:17.327 --> 48:18.526
Yeah it's fucking real.

48:18.528 --> 48:20.861
[Nicole] What we just
had was pretty real too.

48:20.863 --> 48:23.464
[Chris] My meter on my
battery just dropped about

48:23.466 --> 48:24.434
15 minutes.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.269
It just lost power.

48:28.638 --> 48:30.671
I'm down to 45 minutes left.

48:30.673 --> 48:33.877
Chuck sirs can you
hold these for me?

48:36.078 --> 48:37.944
I need to get some photographs.

48:37.946 --> 48:40.282
(mumbles)

48:41.751 --> 48:43.886
(mumbles)

48:45.021 --> 48:47.990
[Chuck] You see
that one over there?

48:55.597 --> 48:59.399
[Dan] We thank you
for allowing us in.

48:59.401 --> 49:00.935
We ask that you watch over us.

49:00.937 --> 49:02.239
Keep us safe.

49:08.044 --> 49:12.513
(mumbles) again in respect

49:12.515 --> 49:13.516
that my love

49:15.517 --> 49:18.254
and respect to our great people.

49:22.057 --> 49:25.494
This is messed up
stuff Chris really.

49:26.863 --> 49:27.729
[Dan] You get some pictures?

49:27.731 --> 49:28.529
Oh your camera died didn't it?

49:28.531 --> 49:29.564
[Nicole] My camera died.

49:29.566 --> 49:30.665
We can check out
some pictures too.

49:30.667 --> 49:33.066
[Chris] I got two
batteries somewhere.

49:33.068 --> 49:35.404
[Dan] You alright Chuck?

49:54.156 --> 49:57.026
[Chris] Guys shh
stop stop stop!

49:58.660 --> 50:00.329
Stop look that way.

50:05.100 --> 50:06.702
You guys see that?

50:08.703 --> 50:09.368
[Amy] What do you wanna do?

50:09.370 --> 50:11.104
What are you doing?

50:11.106 --> 50:11.839
What do we do?

50:11.841 --> 50:13.910
[Chris] I don't know.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.848
These guys are stalking us.

50:20.982 --> 50:21.982
Don't shine the light that way.

50:21.984 --> 50:23.586
No no no no no no!

50:26.488 --> 50:29.425
These guys are
fuckin' stalking us.

50:33.095 --> 50:35.062
Dude he's got a
fuckin' laser beam.

50:35.064 --> 50:35.930
He's got a fuckin' laser.

50:35.932 --> 50:36.796
Go that way.

50:36.798 --> 50:38.001
Go go go go go!

50:39.702 --> 50:40.569
Go guys.

50:45.106 --> 50:47.376
[Chuck] Fuckin' noises.

50:50.078 --> 50:52.745
[Chris] Turn your lights off.

50:52.747 --> 50:54.482
Right off now!

50:54.484 --> 50:55.518
Get them off.

51:01.756 --> 51:02.923
Fuck he's got a damn laser.

51:02.925 --> 51:03.991
Holy shit!

51:03.993 --> 51:05.959
He's got a laser and
it's right there.

51:05.961 --> 51:07.560
Get down get down get down!

51:07.562 --> 51:08.897
[Amy] Get down!

51:10.566 --> 51:11.397
[Chris] What the fuck man?

51:11.399 --> 51:12.566
What in the fuck is going on?

51:12.568 --> 51:14.100
[Chuck] Please cover
that fucking red light.

51:14.102 --> 51:16.035
Cover that red light.

51:16.037 --> 51:17.639
[Chuck] Shut up.

51:22.644 --> 51:24.913
[Chris] What the fuck man?

51:26.082 --> 51:28.515
[Amy] Oh my God
what are they doing?

51:28.517 --> 51:29.750
[Chuck] Shut up.

51:29.752 --> 51:33.854
That fucking light's
right on my fucking head.

51:33.856 --> 51:35.288
[Chris] Go back that way.

51:35.290 --> 51:37.660
[Amy] Fucking spider web.

51:38.928 --> 51:39.593
[Chris] Go go.

51:39.595 --> 51:40.326
Move you guys move.

51:40.328 --> 51:42.997
They're coming this way.

51:42.999 --> 51:44.934
I'm not fuckin' around!

51:54.943 --> 51:55.676
Dude they're right behind us.

51:55.678 --> 51:57.881
They're right behind us.

51:58.981 --> 52:00.080
They're right behind us.

52:00.082 --> 52:01.984
[Sophia] We gotta go.

52:06.789 --> 52:08.689
[Chris] What the hell
did we do to those guys?

52:08.691 --> 52:11.158
What the hell did we
just say to those guys?

52:11.160 --> 52:12.859
I didn't say anything to them.

52:12.861 --> 52:14.194
[Chris] I know you
didn't say anything.

52:14.196 --> 52:17.131
No I don't think anybody
said anything to them Chris.

52:17.133 --> 52:18.832
[Chris] They've been
on us since we got here.

52:18.834 --> 52:20.234
Yes they have.

52:20.236 --> 52:22.102
It's abundantly clear that

52:22.104 --> 52:25.107
they've been on us
this entire time.

52:26.676 --> 52:28.075
[Chris] What the fuck
this is state property.

52:28.077 --> 52:29.176
Yes I know.

52:29.178 --> 52:30.511
[Chris] We have
every right to be here.

52:30.513 --> 52:33.279
We have every right to be
here and I got it cleared.

52:33.281 --> 52:35.017
It was cleared okay?

52:36.785 --> 52:39.720
[Chris] That dude had
a fucking laser pointer.

52:39.722 --> 52:40.990
I know he did.

52:43.859 --> 52:44.994
I know he did.

52:46.963 --> 52:49.098
(sobbing)

52:55.604 --> 52:58.574
[Chris] Man I
hope I was rolling.

53:00.609 --> 53:03.810
I don't know if I
was rolling or not.

53:03.812 --> 53:04.948
One more take.

53:07.883 --> 53:10.017
A lot of the footage so
far has been overexposed,

53:10.019 --> 53:11.285
out of focus,

53:11.287 --> 53:12.222
just rough.

53:15.925 --> 53:18.792
The most important
thing the cemetery,

53:18.794 --> 53:20.259
looked at that footage,

53:20.261 --> 53:21.261
missed a lot of it,

53:21.263 --> 53:22.629
don't know how

53:22.631 --> 53:27.170
and I got an awful distortion
coming over my microphone.

53:28.638 --> 53:33.107
I'm heading out tomorrow morning
and I am going to reshoot

53:33.109 --> 53:34.808
some of that scene

53:34.810 --> 53:35.508
or some of that footage.

53:35.510 --> 53:37.213
See if I can salvage

53:38.680 --> 53:40.980
what we have there.

53:40.982 --> 53:43.783
Come back and pack and
get ready for the boat.

53:43.785 --> 53:44.951
And I'm out.

53:44.953 --> 53:45.821
And cut.

53:50.158 --> 53:50.890
Turn that light off.

53:50.892 --> 53:52.959
Turn the camera off man.

53:52.961 --> 53:54.861
[Chuck] Wacky wackerson.

53:54.863 --> 53:56.897
Anybody sees this

53:56.899 --> 53:59.966
that sleeping leg
right there was

53:59.968 --> 54:04.203
fucking going up and down
like a God damn elevator.

54:04.205 --> 54:06.642
(crickets)

54:48.850 --> 54:50.953
(static)

55:11.774 --> 55:14.777
(branches snapping)

55:27.089 --> 55:28.291
At this point

55:30.158 --> 55:33.162
I'm thinking this
is total bullshit.

55:37.165 --> 55:38.368
I wanna go home

55:42.537 --> 55:44.772
and if I don't go home

55:44.774 --> 55:49.308
I think that Chris's film
is gonna be pretty simple.

55:49.310 --> 55:52.115
It's film crew
goes to an island,

55:53.214 --> 55:55.948
film crew goes into the woods,

55:55.950 --> 55:57.919
film crew gets stalked,

55:59.321 --> 56:01.190
and film crew is dead.

56:03.392 --> 56:04.260
The end.

56:07.863 --> 56:11.330
Just give up this Indian
paranormal fantasy thing.

56:11.332 --> 56:13.269
My God just give it up.

56:18.173 --> 56:20.376
(crickets)

56:29.517 --> 56:32.354
(birds chirping)

56:36.524 --> 56:39.058
[Chris] Insanely at
the freaking cemetery.

56:39.060 --> 56:39.926
I looked at it this morning.

56:39.928 --> 56:40.829
It's awful.

56:41.863 --> 56:42.529
It's really bad.

56:42.531 --> 56:43.830
The audio is blown.

56:43.832 --> 56:46.165
All the audio channels are
blown plus it's so dark

56:46.167 --> 56:47.868
and things are really blurry and

56:47.870 --> 56:48.901
rainy and shit.

56:48.903 --> 56:51.138
I'm gonna go run
up to the cemetery.

56:51.140 --> 56:54.107
You're gonna go back
to the cemetery?

56:54.109 --> 56:55.207
After last night?

56:55.209 --> 56:56.944
[Chris] It'll take
me a half an hour.

56:56.946 --> 56:58.011
(branch snaps)

56:58.013 --> 57:01.381
Chris I don't think
that's a good idea.

57:01.383 --> 57:02.582
Based on the footage I got

57:02.584 --> 57:04.350
I have to go back up there.

57:04.352 --> 57:07.120
You didn't feel anything
that took place last night?

57:07.122 --> 57:09.189
[Chris] Nothing no.

57:09.191 --> 57:11.524
I'm not gonna go back
up there with you.

57:11.526 --> 57:13.993
I think that we've
kind of intruded

57:13.995 --> 57:17.999
and I don't wanna bring
anything down on myself.

57:22.171 --> 57:25.006
(birds chirping)

58:00.341 --> 58:02.944
(owl hooting)

58:34.709 --> 58:37.847
(mysterious noise)

58:49.325 --> 58:52.261
(mysterious noise)

58:54.964 --> 58:58.501
(static)
Who's out there?

59:01.102 --> 59:02.504
Chuck come on man.

59:06.408 --> 59:08.107
Pick up your fucking
walkie talkie.

59:08.109 --> 59:10.345
There's something out here.

59:37.772 --> 59:39.638
[Chuck] Chris where are you?

59:39.640 --> 59:42.110
[Amy] Chris where are you?

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:15.642
(branches snapping)

01:00:15.644 --> 01:00:17.513
[Man] What was that?

01:00:29.725 --> 01:00:32.158
[Chuck] Did he even
have a fucking radio?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.593
Did you give him a radio?

01:00:34.595 --> 01:00:35.794
[Chuck] No I didn't
give him a radio.

01:00:35.796 --> 01:00:37.696
I don't have to be
everybody's fucking parent.

01:00:37.698 --> 01:00:38.730
You didn't give him a radio?

01:00:38.732 --> 01:00:40.399
You've got a radio
but he doesn't?

01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:42.405
You didn't give him one?

01:00:45.506 --> 01:00:47.107
[Chuck] Why am I responsible
for what Chris does

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:49.045
when he just takes off?

01:01:00.254 --> 01:01:02.189
Chuck do you have
any fucking idea

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.357
where we're going right now?

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.357
Do you have any clue at
all where we're going?

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:06.758
[Chuck] I have an idea.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.096
It's been a long time since
I've been up here Amy alright?

01:01:10.098 --> 01:01:11.397
It's been a long time.

01:01:11.399 --> 01:01:13.100
Everything is not the same.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.133
You've got an idea.

01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:14.935
You have an idea.

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.535
Is that all you have Chuck?

01:01:16.537 --> 01:01:17.571
Is that all you have really?
Does your mouth

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.437
keep running?

01:01:18.439 --> 01:01:19.506
It does (laughs)

01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:22.578
Actually it does
thank you for asking.

01:01:23.745 --> 01:01:25.712
(growling)

01:01:25.714 --> 01:01:26.846
[Chuck] Hold up.

01:01:26.848 --> 01:01:28.450
Did you hear that?

01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:41.794
[Amy] Oh my God.

01:01:41.796 --> 01:01:44.263
It's just getting
darker and darker out

01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.332
and you don't even
know where we're going.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:48.535
I don't know where
we're going do you?

01:01:48.537 --> 01:01:51.138
[Chuck] All I can say
is I have an idea alright?

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.772
It changed Amy!

01:01:52.774 --> 01:01:54.640
I haven't been up here forever.

01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:56.308
How many times do I
gotta say this shit?

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.243
[Amy] Do you know what?

01:01:57.245 --> 01:01:58.511
I'm gonna get this.

01:01:58.513 --> 01:02:00.048
Hold on a second.

01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:02.582
[Chuck] Oh Jesus Christ.

01:02:02.584 --> 01:02:04.417
[Amy] Just for posterity.

01:02:04.419 --> 01:02:05.919
Come on.

01:02:05.921 --> 01:02:08.488
Tell everybody what
you just said to me.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:10.423
[Chuck] You are a
fucking drama queen.

01:02:10.425 --> 01:02:12.424
You are a fucking drama queen!

01:02:12.426 --> 01:02:13.225
[Amy] There we go.

01:02:13.227 --> 01:02:15.462
There you go that's Chuck.

01:02:15.464 --> 01:02:17.400
That's Chuck everybody.

01:02:18.499 --> 01:02:20.433
You don't want to look
for Chris anymore?

01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:21.567
You want to go back to camp?

01:02:21.569 --> 01:02:22.968
[Amy] You know what?

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:26.805
Yeah I do want to go back to
camp and I'm going to pretend

01:02:26.807 --> 01:02:29.375
he's got a radio but
his batteries are dead.

01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:31.444
Is that alright with you?

01:02:31.446 --> 01:02:33.279
This isn't pretend Amy.

01:02:33.281 --> 01:02:35.915
This isn't pretend anymore
this is fucking real.

01:02:35.917 --> 01:02:37.316
Just because you're
uncomfortable,

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:38.553
lazy hot tired,

01:02:39.888 --> 01:02:42.756
and scared doesn't mean we
leave somebody out there.

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:43.823
[Amy] Which one am I?

01:02:43.825 --> 01:02:45.591
You're all of those
but which one am I?

01:02:45.593 --> 01:02:46.392
I'm hot yeah.

01:02:46.394 --> 01:02:47.194
I have to look for Chris.

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:47.993
I'm gonna look for Chris.

01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:49.196
I want to look for Chris.

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:51.598
I'm not abandoning
anybody anymore out here.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.500
You want to go back to camp
'cause you get so fucking tired.

01:02:54.502 --> 01:02:56.368
You're lazy and you're
a fucking bitch!

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.205
I'm sick of your mouth!

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.707
You want to go back to camp
and abandon fucking people

01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:02.776
go right the fuck ahead!

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.580
See if I give a fuck!

01:03:13.522 --> 01:03:16.225
Need your fuckin' mouth anyway.

01:03:17.993 --> 01:03:20.227
You're on your own.

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.163
Go to hell.

01:03:23.265 --> 01:03:24.232
Go to hell.

01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:29.602
[Chuck] Amy wait.

01:03:29.604 --> 01:03:31.238
[Amy] Leave me alone.
We can't leave each other.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.504
Come on.

01:03:32.506 --> 01:03:33.839
[Amy] Leave me alone okay?

01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:34.707
[Chuck] Amy I'm sorry.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.243
Come on.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:36.910
We can't separate.

01:03:36.912 --> 01:03:37.877
Come on Amy.

01:03:37.879 --> 01:03:39.645

01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:40.879
Leave me alone.

01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:43.250
[Chuck] Amy come on!

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.421

I got nothing right now.

01:05:34.629 --> 01:05:38.701

01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:44.639

01:05:52.414 --> 01:05:54.413
accept when I'm lost in
the woods and I'm calling

01:05:54.415 --> 01:05:55.850

01:05:58.053 --> 01:06:01.787
I'm sicker than shit

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:02.855

01:06:02.857 --> 01:06:04.390
I got no footage.

01:06:04.392 --> 01:06:06.392
Nothing worth a fuck!

01:06:06.394 --> 01:06:09.095
You gotta fuckin'
pick up your radio.

01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:11.767
This project is fucking wasted.

01:06:13.935 --> 01:06:15.067
I gotta get my shit together.

01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:16.571

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:52.939
They're stalking me.

01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:55.441
There's something stalking me.

01:06:55.443 --> 01:06:57.977
It's those guys or
something in the woods.

01:06:57.979 --> 01:06:59.714
