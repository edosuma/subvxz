Oh, come on.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.833
I am bored out of my fucking mind here.
I know you're holding.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.541
Just give me a little something.

00:27.541 --> 00:30.708
Acid, shrooms, ludes,
dealer's choice, I'm not picky.

00:31.208 --> 00:34.333
That, or I'm gonna lick you like one
of those psychedelic frogs in the Amazon.

Ugh. Damn, nothing.

00:46.416 --> 00:49.416
Have you seriously been
listening to yourself this whole trip?

00:49.416 --> 00:50.625
Don't know if you've noticed,

00:50.625 --> 00:53.500
but not a lot
of entertainment options around here.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.708
You know, Tom Jones does
a killer version of this song.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.416
I don't even know
why you bothered doing it.

01:00.416 --> 01:02.791
Don't you have something else
better to be doing?

01:02.791 --> 01:05.166
I guess I could try
licking Leary's face again.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.416
Tastes like old man balls, by the way.

01:07.416 --> 01:09.458
Thanks for the disturbing visuals.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.625
Hey, I know you, man.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.333
Everybody knows me.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.750
That's kind of how being me works, buddy.

01:49.750 --> 01:50.708
Now, you mind?

01:50.708 --> 01:52.041
No, you don't understand.

01:52.041 --> 01:54.250
I know the other you.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.333
I worked on you in Germany, man.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.333
Pretty sure you're tripping on something.

01:59.333 --> 02:02.166
Of course I am. It's kind of my job.

02:02.166 --> 02:05.416
I basically invented the whole
hallucinogenic business model.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.375
I'm like the Ray Kroc
of getting fucked up.

02:08.375 --> 02:09.916
Good luck with that.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.750
Now, if you'll excuse me.

02:12.791 --> 02:14.708
No, I know you.

02:15.333 --> 02:19.250
You're Tupelo. You're Project Tupelo, man.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.541
<i>Tupelo, man.</i>

02:21.541 --> 02:23.583
 No, it's fine.
He won't remember a thing.

02:24.833 --> 02:27.375
Jesus Christ. What the hell?

02:27.375 --> 02:29.875
- Let me guess, flashbacks?
- What?

02:29.875 --> 02:31.625
 Yeah, I know.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.125
Those fuckers can be nasty.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.458
I tried to weed them out,
but I never got the formula quite right.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.041
Here, when you're
someplace safe and comfy,

02:40.041 --> 02:41.208
take one of these.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.625
Sugar cubes? What am I, a fucking horse?

02:43.625 --> 02:45.416
 Weirdly, yes.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.000
Sometimes.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.416
Oh, that's a good boy, good boy.

02:49.416 --> 02:51.000
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.458
No, no, no, look.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.000
Those little magic carpet rides

02:54.000 --> 02:56.416
are dosed with my very own
Timothy Leary signature brand,

02:56.416 --> 02:59.250
organic, pharmacy-to-table, artisan LSD.

02:59.250 --> 03:00.875
It's the same batch I gave the Beatles.

03:00.875 --> 03:04.833
You do realize I'm a federal narcotics
officer, sort of, don't you?

03:04.833 --> 03:07.416
Oh, that bullshit Nixon photo-op?

03:07.416 --> 03:08.833
 Yeah, okay.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.500
It makes a great coffee mug.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.541
There's an Elvis/Nixon coffee mug?

03:13.583 --> 03:16.791
Wow, you need to get
a handle on your merchandising, Tupelo.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.125
- Yeah.
- What is it? Another flashback?

03:21.125 --> 03:22.250
That is so weird.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.041
Something must be
triggering those, Tupelo.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.291
I bet it's the word "Tupelo."

03:28.416 --> 03:30.666
For God's sake,
will you stop saying "Tupelo"?

03:32.208 --> 03:33.958
Okay, that one's on you, Tu--

03:35.333 --> 03:38.208
Listen, you have secrets deep inside you.

03:38.708 --> 03:42.125
Take the LSD and free your mind, brother.

03:42.125 --> 03:46.041
Free your mind, and your ass will follow.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.833
 <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please return to your seats.</i>

03:48.833 --> 03:50.666
<i>We will be landing in Memphis shortly.</i>

03:53.041 --> 03:54.916
Okay, okay, listen up, people.

03:54.916 --> 03:58.083
When we get in the terminal,
form a perimeter around my Elvis,

03:58.083 --> 04:00.166
and no matter what, y'all keep moving.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.791
All right, whatever. As long as we stop
and grab a Goo Goo Cluster.

04:02.791 --> 04:04.333
I'm literally starving to death.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.916
Stopping's a bad idea.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.291
Yeah, that's when they swarm.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.208
Swarm?

04:09.208 --> 04:14.833
Swear to God, this man is like
Marvin Gaye to white people.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.875
I don't think the whole
swarming thing's gonna be a problem.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.000
Okay, now that's fucking trippy.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Damn, my shit is good. Mwah.

04:24.291 --> 04:27.708
This week's the first-ever
Elvis convention at The Peabody.

04:27.708 --> 04:30.500
I guess that explains
all the extra mes walking around.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.125
Although I'm not sure it explains that.

04:37.666 --> 04:38.625
Welcome home, E.

04:38.625 --> 04:42.125
Got the Caddy waiting outside,
all shined up and ready to roll.

04:42.125 --> 04:46.083
Mm! These Goo Goo Clusters
are fucking amazing.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.958
Best thing to ever
come out of Tennessee.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.083
I think you're forgetting,
I came out of Tennessee.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.416
Mm, actually, I'm not.

04:56.541 --> 05:00.583
<i>♪ Long-distance information

05:05.666 --> 05:07.125
Damn, it's good to be me.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.291
Listen up, all of you.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.375
Starting right now,
Graceland is off-limits for the weekend.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.375
I need some alone time with my Priscilla.

05:18.375 --> 05:21.333
Easy, tiger, it's not like
I want to hang out with you either.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.833
Professor and I are gonna
grab some ribs, see some sights.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.500
Oh, you got to see The Peabody ducks.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.375
Yeah, I read about those on the plane.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.125
Ducks in a hotel lobby.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.916
Sounds thrilling, as far as
giant health code violations go.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.416
I don't care what y'all do

05:35.416 --> 05:37.916
as long as
whatever you're doing ain't here.

05:37.916 --> 05:40.375
But yeah, you should
really check out the ducks.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.000
'Scilla, I'm home. Where are my girls?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.583
I'll be right down, baby.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.000
I had Patsy take Lisa for the weekend.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.458
I wanted you all to myself.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.416
I sure like the sound of that.

05:52.416 --> 05:55.041
Make yourself comfy
and put on the blindfold.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.291
I got a surprise for you.

05:57.875 --> 06:01.416
Lord Almighty,
I feel my temperature rising.

06:03.416 --> 06:05.250
Take off that blindfold.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.958
It is seriously good to be me.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.500
Who the hell is Cowboy Jeb?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.958
Ah, sweet, beloved Cowboy Jeb.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.041
He had the number-one
children's show in Memphis.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.625
<i>Cowboy Jeb's Jungle Gymboree!</i>

06:22.125 --> 06:23.375
Everybody loved him.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.750
Then his show got canceled.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.500
Oh. If everybody loved him so much,
why'd he get canceled?

06:28.500 --> 06:32.500
Turns out old Jeb's idea of a jamboree
was getting blackout drunk

06:32.500 --> 06:36.291
and hosting wild orgies
with that fella from <i>Hogan's Hero.</i>

06:36.291 --> 06:38.166
Okay.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.791
I love this guy.

06:39.791 --> 06:43.166
All right, so how does the chimp
fit into this Norman Rockwell painting?

06:43.166 --> 06:47.583
Well, it all started
when Scatter got kicked out of NASA.

06:51.833 --> 06:54.958
<i>That damn fool couldn't keep
his monkey junk in his diaper.</i>

06:54.958 --> 06:57.291
<i>Knocked up one of the other space chimps.</i>

06:57.291 --> 06:58.625
<i>He was devastated.</i>

06:58.625 --> 07:03.041
<i>It took him
on a nasty spiral of drugs, drinking,</i>

07:03.041 --> 07:05.375
<i>and dumpster sex with strangers.</i>

07:05.375 --> 07:06.375
Hmm?

07:17.750 --> 07:21.625
<i>All he ever wanted
was to be the first chimp on the moon.</i>

07:22.208 --> 07:24.750
<i>But he only made it as far as Memphis.</i>

07:26.375 --> 07:29.000
-  <i>And when the money ran out,</i>

07:29.000 --> 07:32.125
<i>Scatter did photo shoots
for</i> Barely Human <i>magazine.</i>

07:32.125 --> 07:34.208
<i>Lordy, I pray for that monkey's soul.</i>

07:34.208 --> 07:39.333
<i>But every unholy sin he made
went to paying for his next fix.</i>

07:41.166 --> 07:43.333
<i>Jeb took him in and cleaned him up.</i>

07:43.333 --> 07:45.625
<i>Least he could do after pissing on him.</i>

07:45.625 --> 07:48.708
<i>He gave Scatter
a job as his sidekick,</i>

07:48.708 --> 07:53.166
<i>and that nasty-ass chimp
turned out to be a big hit with the kids.</i>

07:53.166 --> 07:54.791
<i>Things were great.</i>

07:54.791 --> 07:58.833
<i>But then the sponsors found out
about Cowboy Jeb's kinky side.</i>

07:58.833 --> 08:01.083
<i>And gave him a big, fat raise?</i>

08:03.208 --> 08:05.375
Cowboy Jeb lost everything,

08:05.375 --> 08:07.125
ended up going bankrupt,

08:07.125 --> 08:10.083
and sold Scatter to Elvis for 200 bucks.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.791
Wow, cheap.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.166
How much did he pay for Bobby Ray?

08:16.375 --> 08:18.916
- Baby... Baby, wait.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.291
Look, I got a little surprise for you.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.291
As sexy as you look right now,

08:24.291 --> 08:26.750
I was thinking
maybe we can connect on a...

08:27.416 --> 08:28.458
deeper level.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.791
Ooh, please tell me
that's lysergic acid diethylamide.

08:31.791 --> 08:35.083
Didn't realize
you're on a first-name basis with LSD.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.750
 Didn't know you listened
to this kind of music either.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.916
Baby, it's groovy, don't you think?

08:45.916 --> 08:50.250
Well, it definitely fits
with the incense and black light posters,

08:50.250 --> 08:52.791
that I didn't even know we had,
by the way.

08:52.791 --> 08:57.458
I'll have you know I happen to be
a very cool and with-it chick,

08:57.458 --> 09:01.000
which maybe wouldn't be such a surprise
if you weren't gone so much.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.541
I know. I know. I know.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.541
I just...

09:05.125 --> 09:06.458
Are you sure you want to?

09:07.791 --> 09:09.875
I guess that answers that question.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.708
I'm still not feeling anything.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.458
Damn, me either.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.791
I think maybe it takes a while to kick in.

09:19.791 --> 09:21.833
Surprise, asshole. Ha-ha!

09:21.833 --> 09:23.416
How's this for kicking in?

09:23.416 --> 09:24.916
Buckle up, buttercup!

09:24.916 --> 09:25.916
What the fuck?

09:26.625 --> 09:27.833
Exactly.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.458
I don't see what the big deal is.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.250
I thought we'd at least
see colors or something.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.791
Shit, be right back.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.458
What the hell are you doing here?

09:42.458 --> 09:43.500
Well...

09:44.083 --> 09:46.416
- funny story.
- That I don't wanna hear.

09:46.416 --> 09:49.166
You know that barbecue place
you're always babbling about? Ray Ray's?

09:49.166 --> 09:51.625
Yeah, what does Ray Ray's
have to do with anything?

09:51.625 --> 09:52.833
Okay, well, here's the thing.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.791
Don't be mad,
but the restaurant is not there anymore.

09:55.791 --> 09:58.666
- What?
- I mean, as of a few minutes ago.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.666
I'm surprised you didn't see the fireball.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.083
What are you talking about?

10:02.083 --> 10:04.375
Those assholes followed us
back to the States,

10:04.375 --> 10:06.541
the ones from Algeria
who tried to take Leary.

10:06.541 --> 10:08.500
The Professor and I
had just ordered some ribs

10:08.500 --> 10:10.416
when they came
out of nowhere, and then we...

10:11.166 --> 10:13.666
- We kind of got into a little dust-up.
- Dust-up?

10:13.666 --> 10:14.750
Okay, fine, bloodbath.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.375
So, then you came here,
to my fucking home.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.666
Relax, nobody followed me.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.208
Wanna tell him that?

10:26.500 --> 10:30.125
Kill that motherfucker. Finish him.
Chew on his dead fucking eyeball.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.458
I'm not an animal!

10:31.458 --> 10:33.708
I'm not eating anybody's eyeball!

10:33.708 --> 10:35.916
- Uh, no one said anything, dude.
- Jesus.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.708
Oh. I'm losing it.

10:38.708 --> 10:42.083
Uh, yeah, by the way, Agent Overkill,
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.000
Dear God.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.208
You're gonna pass on the eyeballs?

10:46.208 --> 10:47.666
You little bitch.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.708
Jesus, you really are
a pussy motherfucker.

10:50.458 --> 10:53.291
I didn't mean to kill him.
I wasn't even trying to.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.916
Well, his pulverized head begs to differ.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.250
Ugh. It's like head soup.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.833
Would you get out of here, CeCe?
And take Professor Burn-out with you.

11:01.833 --> 11:05.250
Relax, we'll be out
of your weirdly precise hair in no time.

11:05.250 --> 11:08.250
Already called it in. TCB extraction team
will be here in a jiff.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.416
Screw jiff, you need to go.
Get out of here, now.

11:11.416 --> 11:13.166
Priscilla and I just took some LSD.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.500
Get the fuck out.

11:14.500 --> 11:19.041
Look at you being all hip and not square,
taking dangerous hallucinogenic drugs.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.250
I didn't take it to be cool, okay?

11:21.833 --> 11:23.458
Drugs aren't cool, kids.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.541
I'm doing research.

11:25.541 --> 11:27.166
Oh yeah. Yeah, I know.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.208
Me too, since junior high, actually.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.541
So, are you gonna hook me up, or...

11:31.541 --> 11:32.750
I got it from Leary.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.583
Hold the fucking phone!

11:34.583 --> 11:37.791
You have been holding out on me
this whole time, you piece of...

11:38.583 --> 11:40.500
Shit, okay, now I feel bad.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.125
Lucky shot, hillbilly.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.958
Everything okay out there?

11:56.958 --> 11:59.000
I think it's finally kicking in.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.041
Ooh!

12:03.333 --> 12:05.208
Make that definitely kicking in.

12:06.583 --> 12:09.625
Paul McCartney just crawled out of the TV.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.375
Oh my, my...

12:12.375 --> 12:14.000
- my.
- Hello, love.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.625
It feels like I should be
freaking out right now.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.750
Oh relax. You'll be fine.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.541
You know, I've done this a million times.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.083
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.791
People get high listening
to Beatles albums, and then blam,

12:25.375 --> 12:26.625
there I am.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.583
Ideally wearing clothes, you know.

12:28.583 --> 12:29.541
Wait.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.083
People hallucinate you in the nude?

12:32.083 --> 12:35.041
They make me do things,
if you know what I mean.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.583
It's a bloody horror show, actually.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.958
So, are you the only
magical tour guide in these trips,

12:39.958 --> 12:41.708
or do other Beatles show up?

12:41.708 --> 12:44.916
Yeah, well, you know,
mostly people hallucinate either me...

12:44.916 --> 12:47.250
Or sometimes they hallucinate John...

12:47.250 --> 12:48.875
Or sometimes George.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.291
Ringo, not so much.

12:51.833 --> 12:55.083
You know, if the drugs are really shite,
you don't even get a Beatle.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.250
You get one of the fucking Monkees.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.000
Talk about a bloody horror show.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.083
Scatter, you old scamp, you!

13:02.083 --> 13:04.625
Oh, I've missed you, partner.

13:07.541 --> 13:09.125
I'm totally clean.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.250
Sober for two years now.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.625
They're even talking
about bringing the show back.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.041
- I know, right?

13:16.041 --> 13:19.125
I was kind of hoping you'd come back.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.958
Get the old team back together.

13:20.958 --> 13:21.875
What do you say?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.541
Aw!

13:27.750 --> 13:29.708
Oh, this sucks.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.958
 I feel you, brother.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.583
You ever feel, you know, unappreciated?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
All the damn time.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.333
Sometimes it feels like I'm wasting
my life with this whole Elvis thing.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.083
You shut your damn talk hole.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.708
I saw you sing
at the airport Howard Johnson's.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.125
You are goddamn amazing.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.250
Don't pull my chain, man.
You really think so?

13:47.250 --> 13:50.291
Hey, I ain't going to shit down your neck
and tell you it's raining.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.000
Pretty sure I know that's not rain.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.125
I'm telling you, man. If I close my eyes,
I could have sworn you was Elvis.

13:56.125 --> 13:59.250
That's the problem.
No one closes their eyes.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.791
Maybe the world
just ain't ready for a Black Elvis.

14:01.791 --> 14:03.291
I haven't had a gig in months.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.416
Come on, I find that hard to believe.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.458
Believe it, brother.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.875
The only Elvis working less than me
is Orthodox Jewish Elvis.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.208
And that's only because he can't work
weekends starting sundown Friday night.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.500
Ain't that right, Sid?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.916
Shabbat<i>,</i> rattle and roll, my brother.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.125
Could be more coming here.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.458
Or not. Maybe try being more positive.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.666
Okay, I'm positive
there's more coming here.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.541
Oh! Really love
what you've done to the place.

14:37.541 --> 14:40.791
It's got that whole
mid-century modern warfare vibe.

14:40.791 --> 14:41.916
Who's your deco?

14:47.208 --> 14:48.500
Oh! Good call.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.708
Yes, I didn't like
that coffee table either, hideous.

14:51.708 --> 14:54.458
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

14:54.458 --> 14:57.750
Again, weird guy, didn't say anything.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.291
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.333
She can't see me, Einstein.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.708
Do you not know how LSD trips work?

15:06.583 --> 15:09.041
Okay, cupcake,
how the fuck did you follow us?

15:09.916 --> 15:12.750
With the tracker
you left in our submarine.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.541
Thank you for that.

15:14.541 --> 15:15.458
Don't look at me.

15:15.458 --> 15:18.083
You're the one
who left the tracker on the sub, dumbass.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.958
Doesn't mean I want you looking at me.

15:19.958 --> 15:23.375
You have no idea what kind
of shitstorm is coming your way.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.041
We are legion.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.208
Uh-oh, sounds like
you fucked up, superspy,

15:27.208 --> 15:29.083
bringing your dirty work home with you.

15:29.791 --> 15:31.208
Wife's gonna be pissed.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.541
I'd be nervous if I were you,
and not just because

15:33.541 --> 15:36.375
Paul fucking McCartney's trying
to get in her pants in your basement.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.875
Talk about a British invasion.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.625
Side note, you may wanna duck now.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.083
Ooh-whee, I'm pretty!

15:48.250 --> 15:51.666
- Now, let's boogie-woogie, motherfucker.

15:53.541 --> 15:55.333
Yeah, you know, great times.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.166
I did this in Hamburg once,
but it wasn't on a Twister board.

16:05.666 --> 16:09.333
I can't believe I'm gonna die
in your tacky jungle fantasy room.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.625
Tacky?

16:10.625 --> 16:14.625
What? What? What, like your jungle room's
way more refined or something?

16:14.625 --> 16:15.958
That's just it.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.625
No one else has a fucking jungle room.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.041
Uh, the waterfall's a tad much, King.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.375
Oh, you still don't get
how LSD works, do you?

16:29.791 --> 16:31.666
So, this is what dying's like.

16:32.416 --> 16:33.750
Get used to it.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.500
You're in TCB, baby.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.083
You have a bright future in being dead.

16:47.791 --> 16:50.041
I'm usually the peace and love guy
on these trips,

16:50.041 --> 16:53.291
but, uh, this gratuitous violence
is actually a nice change of pace.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.750
Ah! God, I love your accent.

16:58.791 --> 17:02.291
'Scilla, that was incredible.
Where'd you learn to do all that?

17:02.291 --> 17:04.166
I've been taking karate lessons,

17:04.166 --> 17:07.000
something you would know
if you were around more often.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.291
Ah, I "sense a"
trouble in paradise, pretty boy.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.458
Get it?

17:12.458 --> 17:14.041
Sense, sensei...

17:14.041 --> 17:16.000
You get the wordplay, anybody?

17:18.958 --> 17:21.833
How the hell am I gonna
explain all this to Priscilla, huh?

17:21.833 --> 17:24.125
Well, she's tripping her ass off,
so I wouldn't worry.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.500
And that's exactly why
you shouldn't eat meat.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.833
Those poor animals.

17:31.541 --> 17:32.916
I'm serious.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.250
My house looks like a goddamn war zone.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.583
TCB has a cleanup crew.

17:36.583 --> 17:40.000
They'll get this place back
to all its cheesy splendor in no time.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.833
Um, side note,
we might want to take care of that first.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.666
If you follow us, she dies.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.541
Mind if I appropriate
this side of your neck?

17:56.541 --> 17:57.833
Get the hell off of me!

17:57.833 --> 18:00.208
Come on, man,
it's <i>The Thing with Two Heads.</i>

18:00.208 --> 18:02.083
Rosey Grier and Ray Milland.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.166
Great fucking movie.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.208
Didn't see it.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.666
Oh! Fucking classic.

18:05.666 --> 18:09.416
They transplant a white bigot's head
onto a Black man's body,

18:09.416 --> 18:11.875
and brilliance ensues, right?

18:11.875 --> 18:13.000
Somehow, I doubt that.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.416
Oh. Well. Excuse me.

18:14.416 --> 18:18.333
It might not reach the cinematic heights
of that piece-of-shit nun movie you made,

18:18.333 --> 18:19.250
but still.

18:37.666 --> 18:40.166
I'm going after Priscilla.
You get the other two.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.583
You're not the boss of me.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.166
But yeah, okay, it sounds like a plan.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.583
Okay, I get it.
They're pretty fucking great.

19:37.833 --> 19:41.041
Listen up,
some assholes kidnapped Priscilla.

19:41.041 --> 19:45.375
I got a brand-new Cadillac for whoever
grabs that fucker by the back door.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.791
You got this, my man.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.458
Hell yeah, I got this.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.916
Here's a song by Mr. Chuck Berry.

19:51.916 --> 19:52.958
Hit it, boys.

19:54.416 --> 19:58.166
There you go, nice gesture letting
a brother show you how it's done.

19:58.166 --> 20:03.291
You do know that Chuck Berry is the true
king of rock and roll, right, King?

20:03.291 --> 20:06.916
I can't stress enough
how much I need you to shut the hell up.

20:06.916 --> 20:10.916
<i>♪ Long-distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee ♪</i>

20:12.500 --> 20:15.500
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm fine. Just go.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.708
You have to be the hero. I get it.

20:22.791 --> 20:25.166
Elvis, the schmucks went that way.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.125
Thanks, man. Dig the sideburns.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.291
<i>♪ Oh help me, information ♪</i>

20:34.291 --> 20:36.791

20:42.000 --> 20:45.333
Whoa! Goddamn!
Who do you think you are? Elvis Knelvis?

20:48.916 --> 20:53.291
Oh man, I know I've been giving you shit,
but that was pretty badass.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.750
Finish him. Kill this asshole.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.916
Ah.

21:06.916 --> 21:07.916
I don't...

21:07.916 --> 21:09.875
I don't know.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.666
I don't know what's real anymore.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.750
Ain't nothing more real
than a memorable beheading.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.875
Let's get shit done.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.541
I don't have to kill him.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.541
Maybe he's got a wife, kids...

21:18.541 --> 21:21.083
Motherfucker, you have a wife and kid.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.125
This animal came to your house,
held a gun to your wife's head.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.416
What if your little girl had been home?
Kill him!

21:27.041 --> 21:29.041
The extra head's got a point, honey.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.541
Maybe you should kill him.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.208
Normally I'd say kill him, boss,

21:32.208 --> 21:35.000
but, hell, I've hardly
been in this episode, so...

21:35.000 --> 21:36.500
Don't listen to Gomer Pyle.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.416
You're a killing machine.
You're my killing machine.

21:39.416 --> 21:40.625
No, goddamn it. No!

21:41.208 --> 21:42.041
No, I'm not.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.333
We don't...

21:44.333 --> 21:47.541
- We don't have to kill him.
- Don't have to kill him!

21:47.541 --> 21:49.625
<i>♪ Goulet, Goulet, Goulet ♪</i>

21:49.625 --> 21:53.125
Yes, we do!

22:00.875 --> 22:02.750
Damn, it's fucked up to be me.

22:06.791 --> 22:08.791
So, how long do you think this LSD lasts?

22:08.791 --> 22:11.125
Can't be over soon enough for me.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.500
Oh look, it's Scatter.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.791
He looks so cute.

22:15.666 --> 22:17.833
What? Hey, I thought I was the cute one.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.125
Oh fuck, look at the time. I gotta go.

22:20.125 --> 22:22.208
I'm late for Jack Nicholson's acid trip.

22:24.416 --> 22:27.041
Trust me, it gets dark fast.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.666
Now, you know that monkey was better off
with that freakshow cowboy, right?

22:34.666 --> 22:37.500
Just like I was better off
before you, asshole.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.125
Exactly how I found them.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.958
They've been sitting like that
going on 12 hours now.

22:42.958 --> 22:44.125
Jesus!

22:44.125 --> 22:46.083
And what the hell happened upstairs?

22:46.083 --> 22:48.958
Looks like I missed a hell of a party,
which is not like me.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.625
Well, that's the damnedest thing.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.958
You got to see this.

22:51.958 --> 22:56.875
That boy was beating his own self up
and shooting up his own goddamn house.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.916
What the hell did you give him?

22:58.916 --> 23:01.208
Ah, one of my custom blends.

23:01.208 --> 23:04.583
An earthy, full-bodied acid
with an oaky vanilla character.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.083
I'm surprised he's still alive, actually.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.291
Got any more?

23:08.291 --> 23:10.583
Oh come on. I'm bored out of my mind here.

23:10.583 --> 23:13.250
I know you're holding.
Just give me a little something.
