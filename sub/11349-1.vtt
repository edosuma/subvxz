CHRISTY: <i>When I was growin' up,
people didn't really talk about miracles.</i>

01:01.771 --> 01:06.568
<i>I'm not sure I understood what they were
or if I believed in them.</i>

01:06.651 --> 01:08.027
(FLIES BUZZING)

01:10.530 --> 01:11.948
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:17.370 --> 01:19.539
<i>A miracle is defined</i>

01:19.622 --> 01:23.835
<i>as something not explicable
by natural or scientific laws.</i>

01:32.260 --> 01:34.596
<i>But then how do you explain it?</i>

01:37.515 --> 01:39.517
<i>How does it happen?</i>

01:40.393 --> 01:43.563
<i>Who or what is behind it?</i>

01:51.613 --> 01:54.324
Kevin, Adelynn, Annabel, let's go!

01:54.407 --> 01:56.743
Kevin! Abbie!

01:57.202 --> 01:59.078
(LAUGHING)

02:01.206 --> 02:03.041
- Oh, my gosh. This is so fun!
- Wait.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.793
Wait. Okay, my turn.

02:04.876 --> 02:06.461
- Okay, okay.
- I want a turn now.

02:06.544 --> 02:07.796
I never got a turn.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.923
- You'll get dizzy.
- You're dizzy.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.133
Well, Adelynn, it's not good
for a six-year-old.

02:12.217 --> 02:13.593
Your brain's still developing.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.386
It sucks being six.

02:15.470 --> 02:16.864
You should watch your mouth, Adelynn.

02:16.888 --> 02:18.449
You know,
you could go to hell for swearing.

02:18.473 --> 02:19.808
I'm not going to hell.

02:19.891 --> 02:21.142
Hell is in California.

02:21.226 --> 02:24.395
- Who told you that, Adelynn?
- Liz Johnson from school.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.440
Is she the one whose parents think
that Disneyland's the work of Satan?

02:27.524 --> 02:28.524
- That's her.
- Well,

02:28.566 --> 02:30.735
no one here is goin' to hell.

02:31.236 --> 02:33.488
Unless you girls get your clothes dirty.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.508
How many times have I told you
not to play outside

02:35.532 --> 02:36.866
in your Sunday school dresses?

02:36.950 --> 02:37.951
- Come here.
- Sorry, Mom.

02:38.034 --> 02:39.178
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's all right.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.663
- I'll just pretend you're not mine.
- (ADELYNN CHUCKLES)

02:41.746 --> 02:42.997
CHRISTY: Hey, Kevin!

02:43.081 --> 02:45.500
I have to tell you not to play
outside before church, too?

02:45.583 --> 02:49.379
They get cranky when they're hungry, baby,
you know that.

02:49.462 --> 02:50.672
Yeah.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.966
- Grab my sweater, would you, honey?
- Okay.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.968
It's quarter to, hon. We're gonna be late.

02:55.051 --> 02:57.345
Relax, baby, we're good. (EXHALES)

02:57.804 --> 02:59.740
- We got to get you changed.
- Don't you worry about it, baby.

02:59.764 --> 03:00.849
I got it all under control.

03:00.932 --> 03:03.412
- Well, it's not shirtless Sunday at church.
- (KEVIN CHUCKLES)

03:03.476 --> 03:06.312
Come on, girls.
Abbie, Adelynn, Anna, let's go!

03:07.939 --> 03:10.692
Go on and get in the truck.
Your mother's stressin' out.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.777
- (CHRISTY LAUGHS)
- You look pretty.

03:12.861 --> 03:14.487
Thanks, Daddy.

03:14.571 --> 03:16.698
- Come on.
- They take after their mama.

03:16.781 --> 03:17.949
Oh, please.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.495
So, do I look handsome?

03:23.955 --> 03:25.373
Or fetching, maybe?

03:28.835 --> 03:29.836
Hmm?

03:32.755 --> 03:34.591
Buckle up, girls. Let's go.

03:34.674 --> 03:37.218
- Nothin', really?
- (CHUCKLES)

03:37.510 --> 03:39.971
All right. Tough crowd.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.351
MAN: <i>Hey!</i>

03:45.435 --> 03:46.895
<i>Here we go!</i>

03:47.103 --> 03:50.023
(SINGING) <i>God, I'm runnin' for your heart</i>

03:50.231 --> 03:52.483
<i>I'm runnin' for your heart</i>

03:52.692 --> 03:55.945
<i>Till I am a soul on fire</i>

<i>Lord, I'm longing for your ways</i>

03:59.032 --> 04:00.241
<i>I'm waiting for the day</i>

04:00.325 --> 04:01.326
MAN: <i>Help me out.</i>

04:01.451 --> 04:05.038
<i>Till I am a soul on fire</i>

04:06.164 --> 04:09.334
<i>Well, I am a soul on fire</i>

04:09.834 --> 04:12.837
<i>I'm running God,
I'm running</i>

04:12.921 --> 04:14.589
<i>And I want to be, I want to be</i>

04:14.672 --> 04:16.632
How 'bout we go this time. Come on.

04:16.716 --> 04:18.885
<i>A soul on fire</i>

04:18.968 --> 04:22.972
<i>Lord, let me be your soul on fire</i>

04:23.056 --> 04:24.265
<i>Come on, help us sing it now.</i>

04:25.183 --> 04:30.313
<i>Soul on fire</i>

04:32.023 --> 04:34.442
- Woo-hoo!
- (ALL CHEERING)

04:35.234 --> 04:37.403
Let's hear it for Mac and the band!

04:39.280 --> 04:40.573
Yeah. That's fantastic.

04:47.872 --> 04:51.501
There is a common phrase,
"No pain, no gain."

04:52.251 --> 04:55.672
And it is, of course,
attributed to the sculpting of our bodies.

04:56.214 --> 04:57.715
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:59.050 --> 05:01.177
But the same principle can be applied

05:01.260 --> 05:05.890
to the sculpting of our character
and the deepening of our spiritual life.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.644
So, when the road gets bumpy,

05:09.727 --> 05:12.981
when the storms rain down,

05:13.064 --> 05:15.066
I could do a few things to protect myself.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.736
You know, I could get a nice helmet.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.738
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:22.532 --> 05:23.533
(GRUNTS)

05:23.741 --> 05:26.661
And we might be able
to find ourselves an umbrella.

05:27.704 --> 05:28.997
Just happened to be there.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.374
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:36.087 --> 05:39.340
Now that that's open,
uh, we better make sure

05:39.424 --> 05:41.718
that our insurance premiums
are paid up, too.

05:41.801 --> 05:44.012
So, we can get an umbrella,

05:44.095 --> 05:47.265
and we can get a helmet,
and we can get insurance.

05:48.307 --> 05:53.271
But there's one thing that we need
that can't be seen,

05:53.354 --> 05:55.314
and it can't be bought.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.316
And that is faith.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.069
Yeah. Amen.

06:00.695 --> 06:03.948
Faith is really the only true shelter.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.577
Amen.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.620
Amen.

SCOTT: Everybody,
I just want to thank the Beams

06:48.826 --> 06:51.996
for opening up their home
for our monthly picnic.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.748
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

06:54.165 --> 06:55.666
You're so good.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.918
Remember,

06:57.001 --> 07:00.797
sign-ups for the trip
to the Dallas Aquarium are this week.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.649
- Not next week, this week.
- Yeah, I want to go.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.509
- Yeah, we'll go.
- And finally, anybody

07:04.592 --> 07:06.677
who has an animal
or who has a friend with an animal

07:06.761 --> 07:09.097
or a family member who has an animal
or you are an animal,

07:09.180 --> 07:10.741

to get out of the house

- (ALL LAUGHING)

07:12.391 --> 07:14.602
...you know, some air conditioning
and a bowl of water,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.521
take 'em over to see
our brother Kevin Beam...

07:16.604 --> 07:19.190
- MAN: Yeah, Kevin!
- ...who has just opened the largest

07:19.273 --> 07:22.693
- mixed animal clinic in Texas. Okay?
- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

07:23.986 --> 07:26.989
Send everybody!
Send everybody and their animals.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.467
- Thank you.
- We'll be prayin' for you.

We'll be prayin' for all of you.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.053
EMMY: I do not even want to know
what you paid for that.

07:31.077 --> 07:32.513
Oh, more than I care to think about.

07:32.537 --> 07:34.890
We took every bit of equity
out of this house so he could open.

07:34.914 --> 07:35.915
Christy.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.250
Every bit of equity.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.960
- You agreed to that?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.461
Oh, see, no.

07:40.545 --> 07:43.673
I could not let Travis do that.
I would not be able to sleep at night.

07:43.756 --> 07:47.844
That's good for you.
Good for you that you're doin' that.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.512

I'm 13, Mom.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.561
I know, almost a grown-up.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.273
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:00.356 --> 08:02.316
I prayed that I make
the Fort Worth all-star team.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
Oh.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.362
Because I have
the second most goals on the team,

08:05.444 --> 08:08.531
so, you know, I think that
I at least deserve a tryout.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.949
I'm with you. (CHUCKLES)

08:15.413 --> 08:17.165
Hey, goober nugget.

Say your prayers?

08:21.794 --> 08:23.129
Share one.

- That I can be older than Abbie and Anna.
- (LAUGHING)

08:26.591 --> 08:29.051
And I prayed that you'll
change my name to Taylor.

08:29.135 --> 08:31.220
Well, I wonder how that's
gonna turn out for you.

08:31.304 --> 08:32.597
Come on, Mom.

08:33.389 --> 08:34.932
I love you, Adelynn.

- I prayed that Daddy's business does well.
- Mmm-hmm.

And I prayed that he can bring home
some more dogs that don't have homes.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.677
Oh, can you cancel that part?

- Me, too.

09:06.631 --> 09:08.716
I think I'm gonna spend
a lot of time there,

09:08.799 --> 09:11.594
enjoying baguettes
and freshly-ground espresso.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.763
Hey, let's do that together.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.566
Paris would be a good mother-daughter trip.

Do you think it was something
from the barbecue?

09:46.504 --> 09:48.547
We all ate the same things.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.480
You know, maybe you should run her
by Dr. Sponder's in the morning.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.387
(ANNA PANTING)

09:56.681 --> 09:58.182

There you go.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.185
Watch your feet there.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.438

Okay.

Let's get you to bed.

I'm gonna sit with you.

Hey.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.415
Why are you still up?

10:23.249 --> 10:25.209
- Is it about Anna?
- Mmm.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.461
Anna's gonna be okay.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.466
It's probably just a bug.

10:33.301 --> 10:34.941
The doctor will give us somethin' for it.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.180
I just feel anxious.

10:38.264 --> 10:39.682
About what?

10:39.765 --> 10:42.601
About everything.
The kids, the house, your business.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.354
- The kids? Come on, the kids are fine.
- Hmm.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.690
Well, my business is gonna work.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.235
Oh, babe, you say that like it's absolute.

10:51.986 --> 10:54.739
Now, this may take a while,

10:54.822 --> 10:56.657
but it'll be okay.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.119
It'll be okay.

It's a good life, Christy Beam.

- It's a good...

11:14.467 --> 11:16.635
It's a good life, Kevin Beam.

CHRISTY: I hope this gastroenterologist
can get to the bottom of this.

11:26.771 --> 11:28.189
I checked him out online.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.359
He's supposed to be one
of the best in Fort Worth.

11:31.442 --> 11:33.027
Well, good. He better be.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.862
He's the third guy we've seen.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.114
- I want to get this figured out.

- It does?
- Yeah, I've gone through

12:08.729 --> 12:11.732
her entire chart and all
of Dr. Sponder's notes,

12:11.816 --> 12:13.359
and the X-ray doesn't show anything.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.361
Dr. Dorsi, she's in constant pain.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.114
I mean, this little girl
has been throwing up for weeks.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.199
She hasn't kept anything down.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.909
Her little tummy's all bloated

12:21.992 --> 12:25.079
and she's been on, well, Xifaxan,
she's been on Augmentin,

12:25.162 --> 12:26.807
- four different antibiotics.
- Look, look, that's why

12:26.831 --> 12:28.791
I'm ruling out anything that's bacterial.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.293
I don't think it's viral.

12:31.377 --> 12:34.588
Ms. Beam, I think your daughter
is lactose intolerant.

12:36.841 --> 12:38.259
What?

12:38.342 --> 12:40.719
- You think she's lactose intolerant?
- Christy.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.097
- Like, allergic to milk?
- DR. DORSI: Ms. Beam.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.600
Considering what y'all have been through,
I would think this is really good news. Huh?

12:46.684 --> 12:47.935
This is easily treatable.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.270
She can't have pizza?

12:49.353 --> 12:50.646
It's not just pizza, sweetheart.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.606
She can't have any dairy.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.890
- She can have cheese-less pizza.
- Who would want that?

12:56.819 --> 13:00.656
Well, um, if Anna can't have pizza,
then I won't have it either.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.534
- KEVIN: Hmm.
- Well, Abbie, that's a great idea.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.369
I'm in.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.496
Me, too.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.789
Ever?

13:08.873 --> 13:11.292
We're not gonna have pizza ever?

13:11.375 --> 13:13.043
Well, until Anna's better.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.465
Well, my body's still growing.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.467
- Wrong answer, genius.
- Abbie.

13:19.550 --> 13:20.634
It's okay, Adelynn.

13:20.718 --> 13:23.012
You're only six. No pressure.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.317
All right, me, too.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.752
- Look at that.
- Yeah, that was hard.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.320
Let's hear it for you, ladybug.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.821
(ALL LAUGHING)

13:40.905 --> 13:43.574
Okay. Here's to you
gettin' well soon, sweetheart.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.328
ANNA: Mommy.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.497
Mommy?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.499
Mommy!

13:52.750 --> 13:54.084
Mommy.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.961
Kevin!

13:56.045 --> 13:57.338
Mommy!

13:58.464 --> 13:59.632
I'm coming!

13:59.715 --> 14:01.193
- I'm coming, baby, I'm coming.
- Mommy. (CRYING)

14:01.217 --> 14:02.259
I'm coming.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.261
- Oh, no, Anna.
- Mommy, it hurts!

14:04.345 --> 14:05.804
No. Kevin.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.431
(PANTING)

14:07.515 --> 14:08.724
I'm coming. What is it?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.684
- Come here, baby. No.
- Mommy, it hurts!

14:10.768 --> 14:12.311
- KEVIN: What is it?
- It hurts, Mommy!

14:12.394 --> 14:14.247
- I think we need to take her to the hospital.
- It hurts!

14:14.271 --> 14:15.749
- I'm gonna call Emmy to come over.
- It's okay, baby.

14:15.773 --> 14:17.292
I'm gonna call Emmy.
We're gonna get you some help.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.317
Hold on, hold on. Okay.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.277
- Here we go. All right.
- (CRYING)

14:22.613 --> 14:24.573
It's all right, honey. It's okay.

14:27.243 --> 14:29.954
Come on. Okay. Okay.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.748
- Okay.
- It hurts.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.041
Open the door, honey.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.417
CHRISTY: There you go.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.211
KEVIN: You're gonna be okay.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.671
- Hey.
- Hey. How is she?

14:38.754 --> 14:40.398
- KEVIN: I know. I know, baby.
- Thank you so much.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.441
EMMY: Oh, God.
CHRISTY: Thank you.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.508
EMMY: You'd do it for me.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.778
- All right, all right. Go, go, go.
- Thank you, my friend.

14:44.802 --> 14:45.803
Here comes Mama.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.012
Let me in, honey-baby.

14:47.096 --> 14:48.097
Okay.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.981
What do we got here?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.291
- 36-year-old male...
- Just hang on.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.942
- What do we got?
- Chest pains.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.860
2201. 2201, please.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.195
Thank you.

15:03.279 --> 15:05.197
I'll be with you in just a minute.

15:05.281 --> 15:06.281
Hello.

15:06.323 --> 15:10.077
...blind by then, of course,
but they teach her to do it as well,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.080
so Mary is just twisting.
They would have this...

15:12.162 --> 15:13.664
It won't be long now.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.832
Okay.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.918
Mom and Dad, you can relax. She's fine.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.254
We got her fever down
and she's starting to respond

15:20.337 --> 15:21.937
to some anti-nausea medicine I gave her.

15:22.006 --> 15:23.924
- You're good to take her home.
- Wait.

15:24.008 --> 15:26.010
Anti-nausea medicine, but for what?

15:26.093 --> 15:29.054
Well, I think this is just
a severe case of acid reflux.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.557
It's not. No, it's not.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.101
I examined her throat
and it's very raw, but other than that,

15:34.184 --> 15:35.936
- everything is fine.
- Hold on a minute.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.814
- Everything is not fine, Doctor.
- Okay.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.191
Maybe we can have
this conversation outside.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.443
We can do that.

15:45.154 --> 15:48.282
Doctor, this is our fourth time here.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.492
This isn't acid reflux.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.120
Her throat's raw 'cause she's been
throwing up for weeks.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.123
Well, Mom, I'm the doctor,
and that's my diagnosis.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.876
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have other patients I need to see.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.630
Excuse me, this is not acid reflux.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.590
She's not lactose intolerant.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.717
There's something wrong
with our little girl.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.028
Mrs. Beam, you need to calm down.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.428
No, you calm down!

16:09.511 --> 16:11.448
You find me another doctor,
you run some more tests!

16:11.472 --> 16:15.559
I'm not leavin' this hospital
until I know what's wrong with my daughter!

16:19.229 --> 16:20.397
Okay.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.112
KEVIN: Listen, let's make sure she's okay.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.178
Mr. and Mrs. Beam, um, this is Dr. Burgi.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.806
He's head of our Pediatrics.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.724
MAN: (OVER PA)
<i>Dr. O'Neil to the ER, please.</i>

16:55.808 --> 16:57.267
<i>Dr. O'Neil to the ER.</i>

16:57.351 --> 17:01.271
So, uh, we did a series of X-rays
and a sonogram,

17:01.355 --> 17:02.564
and I'm sorry to tell you

17:02.648 --> 17:06.609
that there appears to be
100% complete abdominal obstruction.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.737
What is that?

17:08.820 --> 17:12.991
Part of her, uh,
intestines are twisted off.

17:13.659 --> 17:14.867
Please.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.290
So, I can tell you, emphatically,

17:21.375 --> 17:25.087
that if we don't clear
that obstruction right now,

17:25.170 --> 17:27.339
your daughter's gonna die.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.217
We're gonna need to take her right now.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.468
I'm sorry.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.470
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm so sorry.

17:35.389 --> 17:36.724
I'm sorry.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.519
Okay.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.648
MALE NURSE: BP 110/70.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.000
FEMALE NURSE: Okay,
all the fluids are ready.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.919
- Can you check the suction?
- MALE NURSE: Right. Suction's good.

17:47.943 --> 17:49.421
FEMALE NURSE: Will you get me
the Tegaderm, please?

17:49.445 --> 17:50.463
MALE NURSE: It's standing by.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.740
Mr. Beam, will you step back?

17:52.823 --> 17:53.991
Okay. Thank you.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.576
FEMALE NURSE: Okay.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.619
We'll need to insert this tube
into Annabel's nose

17:57.703 --> 18:00.748
and then run it down into her stomach
to begin suctioning, okay?

18:00.831 --> 18:02.583
So, Mrs. Beam, if you could step back.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.294
- Mommy.
- Mr. Beam, if you could come

18:05.377 --> 18:07.755
and hold her down
and help her keep her still,

18:07.838 --> 18:09.214
that will make it easier, okay?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.900
Sir, it's imperative
that we do this now, okay?

18:10.924 --> 18:11.925
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.361
Before we can give her
any anesthesia, all right?

18:13.385 --> 18:14.612
- It's me.
- All right, sweetheart, here we go.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.655
I'm right here with you, okay?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.055
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.223
This is gonna make you...

18:18.307 --> 18:20.601
It's gonna make you feel better, okay?

18:20.684 --> 18:22.436
Okay, don't be scared, okay?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.688
(ANNA SOBBING)

18:24.772 --> 18:26.666
- You need to swallow, sweetheart.
- ANNA: Daddy!

18:26.690 --> 18:29.735
- Daddy, it hurts!
- You need to swallow, sweetheart.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.254
- KEVIN: Baby.
- There you go. There you go.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.047
KEVIN: Baby, it's okay.
It's gonna make you feel better, okay?

18:33.071 --> 18:34.132
All right, all right. Okay, all right.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.550
- It's gonna make you feel better.
- FEMALE NURSE: All done.

18:35.574 --> 18:36.575
All done.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.872
SCOTT: What bird turns into other birds?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.600
- The tiny blue one.
- ABBIE: The blue one.

18:43.624 --> 18:44.726
Are you talking about
the one that launches...

18:44.750 --> 18:46.835
- Yeah.
- ...and you click it and three come out?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.962
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's that tiny little one.

18:49.046 --> 18:51.173
ABBIE: What level are you on?

18:51.256 --> 18:52.508
SCOTT: Oh, uh, Chirp Valley.

18:52.591 --> 18:56.053
I've been stuck on this King Pig Boss
for quite a while.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.639
That's not very good, Pastor Scott.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.641
- (CHUCKLES) No.
- NURSE: Mr. and Mrs. Beam.

19:00.724 --> 19:01.850
Mr. and Mrs. Beam.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.101
Hi.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.065
EMMY: We're praying for you.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.859
Give me your hands, little one.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.070
(SIGHS)

19:14.404 --> 19:16.865
Heavenly Father,
we pray for the health and well-being

19:16.949 --> 19:21.245
of Anna Beam and the entire Beam family,
especially these two...

19:24.456 --> 19:26.917
Uh, so, Anna is okay.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.378
Uh, she's in recovery.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.091
But my findings weren't good.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.970
Um, there were other obstructions
in the small bowel

19:38.053 --> 19:41.890
that required extensive, um, dissection
to free them.

19:41.974 --> 19:45.102
You... You cleared 'em all out,
though, right?

19:47.229 --> 19:49.022
I did. I did.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.653
- But?
- Um...

19:55.320 --> 19:59.783
Unfortunately, um, I'm afraid

19:59.867 --> 20:04.830
that Annabel appears to have
a very severe intestinal motility disorder.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.421
Are... Are you sure?

20:15.841 --> 20:17.134
Yeah.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.012
What is that, Kevin?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.977
It's when her, um...

20:27.060 --> 20:30.564
Her body can't process food.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.489
Since the, um...

20:39.573 --> 20:42.826
The intestines aren't able
to function properly,

20:43.869 --> 20:46.580
what she eats and drinks
tends to sit there.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.416
But she'll be all right now, right?

20:49.499 --> 20:52.878
I mean, she's sick,
but she'll get better, right?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.680
There's no cure, is there?

21:04.306 --> 21:07.684
Um, I'm sorry to say that
presently there isn't.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.231
So, is she restricted to tubal feeding?

21:13.857 --> 21:15.525
In the short term.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.487
Eventually she'll need a gastrostomy tube,

21:18.570 --> 21:21.615
which aren't always successful
in the long term.

21:21.698 --> 21:27.871
I did talk with my colleagues,
and there is a specialist, Samuel Nurko.

21:28.372 --> 21:31.249
He's the country's
foremost motility expert.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.879
He's a pediatrician from Mexico
who's based out of Boston.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.548
He might be able to help.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.135
I don't want to give you false hope,
you know?

21:44.680 --> 21:49.017
But people do come
from all over the world to see him, so...

21:49.893 --> 21:51.269
Excuse me.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.032
I'm very sorry.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.786
Thank you.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.220
CHRISTY: Tramadol,
gabapentin, glucosamine.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.389
KEVIN: Hi, baby.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.600
Do you have water, Anna?

22:32.185 --> 22:33.520
Here you go.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.939
Let's see how breakfast was today.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.357
Okay.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.443
Well, must have been good. It's all done.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.004
KEVIN: Did you get that assignment done?
ABBIE: Mmm-hmm.

22:41.028 --> 22:42.296
- It looked really hard. Was it okay?
- CHRISTY: Great.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.321
Uh, no.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.507
(CHUCKLES) It looked really hard to me.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.949
- I'll tell you that.
- Ready?

22:46.033 --> 22:48.160
- I did my homework.
- I bet it was easy for you.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.120
Baby.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.959
Mommy.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.671
Mommy.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.274
- Almost, almost, almost.
- It hurts, Mommy.

23:01.298 --> 23:02.883
I know, honey. I know.

23:02.966 --> 23:03.967
Ooh. (EXHALES)

23:04.760 --> 23:06.011
You did it.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.473
Okay, let me get you dressed.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.975
Attagirl.

23:12.893 --> 23:14.352
That's a girl.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.814
Here you go, baby.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.276
Cute.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.618

- Not to worry, baby.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.078
I'll take you shopping.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.412
But for today...

23:34.831 --> 23:36.541
For now, let's try these.

23:47.177 --> 23:50.013
Why do you think God hasn't healed me?

23:53.725 --> 23:56.645
There are so many things I don't know.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.358
But I know God loves you.

Hey.

24:26.174 --> 24:27.801
I'm sorry you had to miss the aquarium.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.719
Yeah, me, too.

Hey, where are you going?

24:31.847 --> 24:33.849
(SIGHS) I don't know.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.809
- Library.
- I'll go with you.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.227
Really?

24:37.310 --> 24:39.563
Of course. I love the library.

RECEPTIONIST: <i>Dr. Nurko's office.</i>

Hi, there. This is Christy Beam
calling from Burleson, Texas, again.

24:48.071 --> 24:53.285
I just wanted to make sure
that Dr. Nurko had received my letter.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.704
<i>Mrs. Beam, as I assured you
the last time you called,</i>

24:55.787 --> 24:58.999
<i>we're making every effort,
but Dr. Nurko gets a lot of letters.</i>

24:59.082 --> 25:00.292
I'm sure he does,

25:00.375 --> 25:03.437
but there are specifics to Anna's condition
that I think that he would find...

25:03.461 --> 25:04.730
<i>I really don't know if I'll get a chance</i>

25:04.754 --> 25:06.023

25:06.047 --> 25:07.400
Okay, then I'll call again tomorrow.

Hi, Dr. Burgi, this is Christy Beam calling.
I just wanted to make sure.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.192
Have you spoken to Dr. Nurko?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.195
I just am wondering
why I haven't heard from him.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.361
It's been weeks.

25:28.445 --> 25:29.654
I know.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.240
Well, I want you to know
I've called him three times,

25:32.324 --> 25:34.284
<i>and, uh, you're on the waiting list.</i>

25:34.367 --> 25:36.536

25:39.956 --> 25:42.209

25:42.292 --> 25:44.711
So, you mean when they're cured?

25:47.005 --> 25:48.048
No.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.175
No, I don't mean that.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.891
So, I have to wait for someone to die

25:59.601 --> 26:02.687
and just pray that Anna
doesn't go before then?

Do you even hear me?

26:40.767 --> 26:42.978
'Cause I don't hear you.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.133
Hi, Daddy.

Hey, munchkins.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.556
Hey, baby doll.

I brought you a little somethin'

27:25.854 --> 27:27.647

27:27.731 --> 27:29.899
- He's so cute.
- Ain't he?

27:29.983 --> 27:31.484
- Oh, my.
- He's a Yorkie terrier.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.820
- His name's Napoleon.
- He's adorable.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.864

- KEVIN: Uh-huh.

- Ain't he cute? <i>Oui, oui, oui.</i>

27:37.574 --> 27:38.658
Oh, baby.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.553
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
His owners never came back for him.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.829
- It's strange.
- ANNA: Oh, my gosh.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.223
ADELYNN: Look at his little face!
CHRISTY: Oh, really?

27:44.247 --> 27:46.350
'Cause he looks like a purebred,
probably from a breeder.

- Express mail.

ADELYNN: Hello.
ANNA: He's so cute.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.507
So cute.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.426
Stop putting me in that position.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.637
Is there anything wrong with
trying to make her feel better?

27:59.721 --> 28:01.449
You know, giving her
something to look forward to

28:01.473 --> 28:03.433
when she comes home from school

28:03.516 --> 28:05.935
instead of laying on that couch
day after day?

28:06.019 --> 28:07.395
Well, now we have five dogs.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.731
Five. Don't have a savings account,

28:09.814 --> 28:11.959
- but we have five dogs.
- I don't care if we have 50 dogs.

28:11.983 --> 28:12.984
Well, I care.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.462
I'm the one who has to look after 'em.

28:14.486 --> 28:17.238
Now's probably not the time
to be adding somethin' to my plate.

28:17.322 --> 28:18.632
I'm just trying to lift her spirit.

28:18.656 --> 28:19.699
Oh, and I'm not?

28:19.783 --> 28:23.286
We need a solution, Kevin. We need it now.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.538
Yeah. And we'll get it.

in a particular situation,</i>

28:46.976 --> 28:48.645
I need to ask myself,

28:48.728 --> 28:50.939
and you might want to ask yourself,

28:51.022 --> 28:54.442
"What am I doing or what am I not doing

28:54.526 --> 28:57.028
"that's creating this?

"Have I sinned?

"Have I drifted astray?

I need to man up and get back on track."

- It's been goin' on for quite a while now.

29:38.361 --> 29:40.488
Oh, well, longer than you can imagine.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.532
Well, since she's not been healed,

29:42.615 --> 29:45.452
it may be a good time for you and Kevin

29:45.535 --> 29:49.038
to ask yourselves some difficult questions.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.375
I don't understand.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.211
Honey, Anna is not better,
and she should be.

29:55.295 --> 29:59.048
Now, somebody's sins
are preventing the healing.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.593
Either yours or Kevin's or

30:01.676 --> 30:03.887
maybe even Anna's.

Excuse me.

- Christy.
- I think you might have misunderstood us.

I'm not havin' it.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.207
- Look, you can't...
- I'm gonna go and give them a call.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.709
- No, you can't, you can't, you can't.
- I'm gonna...

30:16.733 --> 30:19.503
KEVIN: I don't want the girls to know
that we're fightin' about people at church.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.488
Why is Mommy yelling at the cows?

30:21.571 --> 30:22.971
CHRISTY: Let me tell you something.

30:23.072 --> 30:25.283
I think they're fighting about me.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.618
But why?

30:26.701 --> 30:29.138
CHRISTY: Just like Pastor Scott said,
you need to look at yourself...

30:29.162 --> 30:31.956
ANNA: Well, because when
someone you love gets sick,

30:32.040 --> 30:33.958
it causes stress.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.187
I can handle her thinkin' that
this is your fault or my fault,

30:36.211 --> 30:38.505
but no one can say that
this is Anna's fault!

30:38.588 --> 30:39.589
Okay. Baby, relax.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.716
Okay, just because
we're all in the same church,

30:41.799 --> 30:43.676
don't mean we're always
gonna see eye to eye.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.803
You just got to let it go.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.223
It'll be okay.

30:48.306 --> 30:51.059
It won't be okay! Stop sayin' that!

30:51.142 --> 30:52.560
Nothin' is okay!

30:52.644 --> 30:55.647
And until it is, I am never
goin' back to that church.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.023
Where you goin'?

30:57.106 --> 30:59.943
I'm gonna take Anna shoppin'
to see if I can get her some clothes

31:00.026 --> 31:01.861
to make goin' to school more bearable!

31:01.945 --> 31:03.821
Come on! Girls, let's go.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.464
You okay?

31:23.633 --> 31:26.052
I prayed that Anna would get better

31:26.135 --> 31:29.055
and that we could play soccer
again like we used to.

31:31.099 --> 31:32.976
I like that prayer.

32:11.514 --> 32:12.974
I can see it.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.827

What doctor are you here to see?

33:48.486 --> 33:50.321
Dr. Sam Nurko.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.323
And what time is your appointment?

33:55.535 --> 33:58.538
Well, I don't have an appointment.

33:59.956 --> 34:02.458
My daughter is Annabel Beam.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.377
That's her right there.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.587
I'm Christy Beam.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.005
I've probably called 100 times.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.341
Anna's doctors have called,
they've written letters.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.051
We're from Texas.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.428
I'm sorry, ma'am.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.888
The doctor can't see you
without an appointment.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.393
Do you have kids of your own?

34:21.476 --> 34:25.273
Because if you do,
you'll understand why I flew all this way

34:25.356 --> 34:27.065
without an appointment.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.860
Is Dr. Nurko available?

34:28.943 --> 34:32.280
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but he's got a nine-month waiting list.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.907
I know. We're on it.

34:34.991 --> 34:36.074
Here.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.869
It's all right here,

34:37.952 --> 34:40.246
how sick Anna is.

34:40.329 --> 34:43.708
She starts her day with Align/Culturelle
for digestive immune support.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.501
At 9:00 a.m., she takes rifaximin,

34:45.585 --> 34:48.254
an antibiotic for bacterial overgrowth
in the GI tract.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.715
She takes hyoscyamine
for intestinal spasms.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.217
At 12:30, she needs gabapentin for...

34:53.301 --> 34:55.719
To regulate her intestinal nerves,

34:55.803 --> 35:00.183
and lately she can't make it more
than three to four hours without tramadol.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.393
She's always in pain.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.020
I'm so sorry.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.731
I have to check in other patients.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.149
Uh, Zach. Zach will...

35:08.691 --> 35:09.734
Bye.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.779
...um, be happy to explain
our patient policy to you...

35:12.862 --> 35:14.530
Look, Anna's always played soccer.

we used to call her Monkey. (SOBBING)

climbing on everything.

"Oh, she's lactose intolerant."

"She has acid reflux."

35:41.349 --> 35:42.475
"It's an infection."

it was something bad. (SNIFFLING)

Well, Boston is one
of the finest cities I know.

I mean, you ask me,
it is the finest city in the country.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.867
But I might be a little biased
because I live here.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.035
I mean, I'm here.

- So, yeah.
- Well, good.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.417
Well, maybe we should try
to do a tour while we're here

38:13.501 --> 38:14.543
if we have time.

38:14.627 --> 38:16.212

a couple really cool places.

you leave the guests alone

39:39.837 --> 39:40.963
What do you mean?

39:41.047 --> 39:44.050
Well, maybe she had to work,
maybe she forgot she had an appointment.

- We could...
- No, I got you.

We could all hop in a cab
or there are buses...

MAN: Heart rate is 73.

47:54.957 --> 47:57.042
She's holding steady at 115/74.

47:59.294 --> 48:03.799
(SIGHS) Mrs. Beam, I didn't take
her medical history at face value.

48:04.841 --> 48:08.470
As you know, we ran
an extensive battery of new tests.

48:09.555 --> 48:12.724
And unfortunately,
the testing confirmed that she is very ill.

48:12.808 --> 48:15.394
And in a tremendous amount of pain.

48:16.353 --> 48:18.689
Okay? So, look.

48:18.772 --> 48:20.315
I'll show you.

48:21.149 --> 48:23.026
This one shows normal function.

48:23.944 --> 48:26.697
The other side,
it's what's happening to Anna.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.992
It's called Pseudo Obstruction
Motility Disorder.

48:30.659 --> 48:32.828
Her condition is akin to a...

48:32.911 --> 48:34.913
To a paralysis of the GI tract.

48:34.997 --> 48:38.417
The top part of the stomach works,
but the bottom doesn't.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.085
The nerves don't fire correctly,

48:40.168 --> 48:44.214
so the intestines can't pick up
the messages the neurons are sending.

48:44.298 --> 48:47.009
Well, what about the pain she's in?

48:50.846 --> 48:53.473
Well, I have to say,

48:53.557 --> 48:56.685
pain is one of the most
complicated things to treat.

48:56.768 --> 49:00.939
Dr. Nurko, we came all the way here
because everyone told me

49:01.023 --> 49:03.001
- you were the one person who could help.
- Yeah, I know.

49:03.025 --> 49:04.318
That you were the person

49:04.401 --> 49:05.503
- who could help me.
- Listen...

49:05.527 --> 49:07.571
That you were the person
who could help my daughter.

49:07.654 --> 49:09.615
Mrs. Beam, I see this every day.

49:09.698 --> 49:12.951
And although there is currently
no cure for Anna's condition,

49:13.035 --> 49:15.954
our treatments are focused on
improving quality of life

49:16.038 --> 49:17.831
and controlling the pain.

49:18.665 --> 49:20.125
There's hope.

49:22.711 --> 49:24.713
Now, the good news.

49:24.796 --> 49:27.507
Our center is one of the very,
very few places

49:27.591 --> 49:31.136
that's been granted permission by the FDA
to prescribe a drug

49:31.219 --> 49:33.972
that can help Anna digest some foods.

49:34.056 --> 49:36.642
If it's successful,
the distension in her stomach

49:36.725 --> 49:40.520
would be reduced
and we could end the tubal feeding.

49:40.604 --> 49:43.482
This would give her
the semblance of a normal life.

49:43.565 --> 49:44.900
A normal life.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.526
That would be wonderful, Doctor.

49:46.610 --> 49:50.030
I mean, however,
there's potential side effects.

49:50.530 --> 49:52.991
Headaches, diarrhea, swelling,

49:53.075 --> 49:56.995
and some that are more dangerous,
like cardiac arrhythmia.

50:00.916 --> 50:05.295
Because of that, I am required to see her
every six weeks for monitoring.

50:05.379 --> 50:06.588
(SIGHS)

50:15.430 --> 50:19.518
I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't believe
it was worth the risk.

50:31.071 --> 50:34.366
CHRISTY: $1,000 for plane tickets to Boston
every six weeks.

50:34.449 --> 50:37.411
$2,000 more a month
to increase our yearly cap.

50:37.494 --> 50:39.871
All the non-covered procedures,
the new medication,

50:39.955 --> 50:41.331
the out-of-network doctors.

50:41.415 --> 50:43.375
Our co-pay is going up across the... Kevin.

50:43.458 --> 50:47.170
- I'm listening.
- I don't know how we're gonna afford this.

50:47.254 --> 50:49.673
Well, I'd say sell the house,
but there's no money in it.

50:49.756 --> 50:51.591
Oh, I know. It just makes me crazy!

50:51.675 --> 50:54.094
I just never thought
you needed such a big place!

50:54.177 --> 50:55.220
Oh, man. Okay.

50:55.303 --> 50:57.723
Here we go. So now it's my fault?

50:57.806 --> 50:59.391
I need to know how we're gonna do it.

50:59.474 --> 51:00.684
Well, we'll figure it out.

51:00.767 --> 51:03.061
No, no. You can't say that.
I hate when you say that!

51:03.145 --> 51:04.455
Well, I'm sorry, babe, but I don't have

51:04.479 --> 51:05.873
- any answers right now.
- I need an answer!

51:05.897 --> 51:08.097
- I can't give you an answer, but...
- I need an answer!

51:08.150 --> 51:09.585
I cannot operate under the assumption

51:09.609 --> 51:11.087
that it's all just gonna be okay! I...

51:11.111 --> 51:12.279
It's called faith, Christy!

51:12.362 --> 51:16.533
I don't have faith about anything.

51:16.616 --> 51:18.618
I can't even pray, Kevin.

51:25.208 --> 51:26.501
(SIGHS)

51:28.253 --> 51:30.130
- I'm sorry.
- No.

51:33.341 --> 51:34.760
I hear you.

51:37.512 --> 51:40.140
But I can't help you with your faith.

51:41.516 --> 51:45.604
But I tell you, I'm gonna do
whatever I have to do.

51:45.687 --> 51:48.774
Okay? I'll open this
place seven days a week.

51:48.857 --> 51:50.275
All right? I'll work double shifts.

51:50.358 --> 51:52.903
I'll get a second job if I have to.

51:54.321 --> 51:56.948
Okay, whatever it takes, I'm gonna do.

51:58.200 --> 52:01.912
SCOTT: I really appreciate you coming by.
I got to say, I miss having you here.

52:02.204 --> 52:04.956
Mmm. Kevin put you up to this.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.750
Well, he's worried about you.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.126
Yeah.

52:08.418 --> 52:10.921
I'm a little worried about me, too.

52:12.798 --> 52:17.219
Well, Kevin told me
what those ladies said to you, and I...

52:17.677 --> 52:20.514
I have to say, I sure wish
that I could give everybody

52:20.597 --> 52:23.016
a spiritual IQ test
before they walk in the door.

52:24.059 --> 52:25.060
But, um...

52:26.061 --> 52:28.230
We can't choose our neighbors.

52:29.064 --> 52:31.316
We're just asked to love 'em.

52:31.399 --> 52:34.277
Well, I'm gonna have to try
and love 'em from home,

52:34.361 --> 52:37.239
'cause I'm not going to church with 'em.

52:40.575 --> 52:44.329
Christy, that's not the reason
you stopped coming, is it?

52:47.207 --> 52:50.001
What can I say or do to help you come back?

52:50.085 --> 52:53.547
Well, you could tell me why a loving God

52:54.256 --> 52:57.342
would let Annabel suffer the way she has.

53:02.305 --> 53:03.473
(SIGHS)

53:04.975 --> 53:08.019
- I'm sorry. I don't have an answer for that.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:08.103 --> 53:13.191
But just because she's sick
doesn't mean there's not a loving God.

53:15.944 --> 53:18.363
Let me tell you,
at the lowest points of my life,

53:19.573 --> 53:21.199
I've tried it both ways,

53:21.283 --> 53:25.704
doing everything I can
to connect to God or walking away.

53:27.414 --> 53:29.916
And in my experience,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.003
one feels a whole lot
better than the other.

I, uh, don't know how to say this,

01:23:36.554 --> 01:23:39.474

of a slight concussion,

no indication of bruising.

01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:53.822
In fact, after hitting the ground skull first
with dirt packed to the top of her head,

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:55.240
she regained consciousness,

01:23:55.323 --> 01:23:57.033

that I didn't tell you about.

As soon as I hit, everything went black.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.743
And I stepped right out of my body.

01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:29.083
But it was kind of weird because...

01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:33.880
Because I could see my body,
but I wasn't in it.

01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:36.216

01:27:52.852 --> 01:27:54.312
But it was different.

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:57.273
It was like... It was like
you could talk to each other

01:27:57.357 --> 01:28:00.401
without really saying any words.

01:28:05.114 --> 01:28:09.869
Like, I said I wanted to stay,
but he told me I needed to come back.

01:28:09.953 --> 01:28:12.747
And he told me that
when I came back, I'd be healed.

01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:17.293
And so I asked him
if he was 100% certain because...

'Cause I didn't want to come back
unless he was right.

Both her stomach and her intestines
are functioning normally.

I mean, all the parts are
talking to each other.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.547
I know that's what's happening medically,
but can you tell me how?

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:46.966
Can you... Can you explain it?

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:52.722
Maybe when she fell and hit her head,
something happened.

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:58.853
Her central nervous system
has been regenerated.

01:29:58.936 --> 01:30:01.689
It's like her software's been reset.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:06.486
So you're telling me
that when this baby girl fell 30 feet,

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:08.780
she hit her head just right
and it didn't kill her

01:30:08.863 --> 01:30:10.073
and it didn't paralyze her

01:30:10.156 --> 01:30:12.784
and instead it healed her?

01:30:13.326 --> 01:30:17.622
People in my profession use the term
"spontaneous remission"

01:30:18.164 --> 01:30:21.834

There's no cure for Anna's condition.

01:30:27.799 --> 01:30:30.760
But according to everything
you're telling me, she's cured.

01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:33.763
I can't medically say that.

01:30:33.846 --> 01:30:37.683

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:15.581
ADELYNN: Anna!

01:37:23.130 --> 01:37:25.090
Miracles are God.

01:37:26.467 --> 01:37:29.553
And God is forgiveness.

01:37:34.433 --> 01:37:37.811
Why was Anna healed
when today around the world

01:37:37.895 --> 01:37:40.481
there are so many children suffering?

01:37:42.441 --> 01:37:44.610
I don't know the answer.

01:37:46.403 --> 01:37:48.280
But after everything I've been through,

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:49.823
I've realised

01:37:52.993 --> 01:37:54.578
I'm not alone.

01:37:56.497 --> 01:37:59.500
And whatever you may be going through,

01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:03.754
I am here to tell you, you are not alone.

01:38:05.631 --> 01:38:08.592
Miracles are God's way of letting us know

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:11.804
he's here.

01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:19.144
Thank you.

01:38:22.815 --> 01:38:26.318
WOMAN: Is it possible that Anna
wasn't as sick as you said she was?

01:38:26.402 --> 01:38:28.571
- MAN: Is she serious?
- I'm sorry?

01:38:28.654 --> 01:38:30.406
Did you seriously just say that?

01:38:30.489 --> 01:38:32.467
- I want to know.
- I'm sure you can all understand

01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:33.826
this is a little hard to believe.

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:36.471
CAROL: Why would they say that?
MAN: And there's a lot of people out there

01:38:36.495 --> 01:38:38.306
- that are just lookin' for publicity.
- That's right.

01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:40.165
- MAN: I can't believe this.
- (MURMURING)

01:38:44.378 --> 01:38:45.963
BEN: I believe her.

01:38:54.013 --> 01:38:55.931
I saw Anna in the hospital.

01:38:57.182 --> 01:38:59.143
She was gravely ill.

01:39:00.311 --> 01:39:04.064
So much so that I wasn't sure
she was going to make it out.

01:39:06.108 --> 01:39:09.069
I've never been a religious person.

01:39:11.697 --> 01:39:13.907
But my beautiful daughter...

01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:17.703
My beautiful daughter

01:39:19.038 --> 01:39:20.581
died recently.

01:39:21.999 --> 01:39:23.792
Her name was Haley.

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.378
And she was 10.

01:39:28.297 --> 01:39:29.882
- She had cancer.
- (CRYING)

01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:33.927
And she suffered a great deal.

01:39:37.389 --> 01:39:40.976
But the last few weeks
of her life were different.

01:39:42.144 --> 01:39:43.562
She felt...

01:39:44.104 --> 01:39:45.481
She felt safe.

01:39:47.733 --> 01:39:49.318
She felt loved.

01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:53.072
She felt...

01:39:55.324 --> 01:39:57.076
She felt God.

01:39:58.911 --> 01:40:03.582
And she felt that way
because Anna gave her faith.

01:40:05.459 --> 01:40:07.503
She gave her peace.

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.215
So...

01:40:12.591 --> 01:40:15.886
I came here today

01:40:15.969 --> 01:40:19.098
from Boston to thank Annabel.

01:40:21.767 --> 01:40:23.644
And to thank you

01:40:25.187 --> 01:40:27.439
for sharing your story.

01:40:38.283 --> 01:40:40.327
(APPLAUSE)

01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:02.725
SCOTT: Thank you all.

01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:04.077
Thank you all very much for coming.

01:41:04.101 --> 01:41:05.370
If you'd like to join us weekly,

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:06.621
- you can sign up in the back.
- Yeah, sure.

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:08.445
Our deacons will take care of that.
Thank you.

01:41:11.567 --> 01:41:12.651
Ben.

01:41:12.735 --> 01:41:16.321
I am so sorry to hear about Haley.

01:41:16.405 --> 01:41:17.573
Hey.

01:41:17.656 --> 01:41:19.742
How can I ever thank you?

01:41:19.825 --> 01:41:22.161
- Oh, look at this.
- I can't believe you came.

01:41:22.244 --> 01:41:23.579
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

01:41:23.662 --> 01:41:25.456
- How are you?
- Good.

01:41:25.539 --> 01:41:27.259
You look so good. That's a very cute dress.

01:41:28.333 --> 01:41:30.169
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES
INDISTINCTLY)

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.683
KEVIN: Here we go, the great pizza reunion.

01:41:44.767 --> 01:41:46.494
- All right, ladybugs.
- ADELYNN: Can we eat now?

01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:47.895
I'm starving.

01:41:47.978 --> 01:41:50.105
Well, let's let your daddy say grace.

01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:54.193
You know what, baby?
Why don't you say it?

01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:57.946
Bow your heads, girls.

01:42:00.991 --> 01:42:05.829
(EXHALES) Dear God,
we give thanks for this meal.

01:42:08.207 --> 01:42:10.459
We give thanks for each other.

01:42:12.503 --> 01:42:15.923
We give thanks for you
and all that you are.

01:42:16.006 --> 01:42:17.090
Amen.

01:42:17.174 --> 01:42:18.634
KEVIN: Amen. Now!
GIRLS: Amen.

01:42:18.717 --> 01:42:19.927
CHRISTY: Ready?
KEVIN: Get it.

01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:21.637
- Here we go!
- ADELYNN: Wait!

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.888
- Wait! Wait!
- Wait, what?

01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:24.473
ANNA: What?
ABBIE: What?

01:42:24.556 --> 01:42:26.350
Let's let Abbie go first.

01:42:26.433 --> 01:42:29.561
It was her idea not to eat pizza
until Anna got better.

01:42:29.645 --> 01:42:31.772
- Aw.
- No, you go first. I mean,

01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:32.916
your body's still growing.
You can go first.

01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.459
- No, you go first.
- ABBIE: It's okay, you can go first.

01:42:34.483 --> 01:42:36.127
ADELYNN: You... No. You go first.
ABBIE: It's fine.

01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:37.671
I don't really care. You can go first.

01:42:37.736 --> 01:42:38.922
ADELYNN: No, you...
ABBIE: You can go first.

01:42:38.946 --> 01:42:39.988
Okay, I'll go first.

01:42:40.072 --> 01:42:41.132
KEVIN: (LAUGHS) Yeah.
CHRISTY: All right.

01:42:41.156 --> 01:42:43.325
- Thank you! Cheers.
- That's more like it.

01:42:43.408 --> 01:42:45.327
KEVIN: Cheers.
ALL: Cheers.

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:46.578
KEVIN: Mmm-mmm.

01:42:46.745 --> 01:42:47.913
Right?

01:42:47.996 --> 01:42:49.248
What do you think, sweetie?

01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:51.208
ANNA: The most amazing thing
I've ever tasted.

01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:52.793
KEVIN: I second that.

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:58.131
CHRISTY: <i>As you can see,
we now live as if every day is a miracle.</i>

01:42:58.465 --> 01:43:00.843
<i>Because for us, it is.</i>

01:43:04.471 --> 01:43:05.806
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:21.196
<i>Here comes the sun...</i>

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.740
- REAL ANNA: <i>Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Anna. How are you?</i>

01:43:23.824 --> 01:43:24.867
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:27.786
<i>And I say it's all right</i>

01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:31.206
REAL ANNA: <i>Adelynn, say hi.</i>

01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:34.042
<i>- This is my little sister, Adelynn.
- Hi.</i>

01:43:34.126 --> 01:43:36.211
<i>This is my big sister, Abbie.</i>

01:43:36.295 --> 01:43:39.256
<i>Hey, stop texting and say hi to the camera.</i>

01:43:39.339 --> 01:43:40.883
<i>Hi</i>. (GIGGLES)

01:43:40.966 --> 01:43:42.968
<i>This is my mom, Christy Beam.</i>

01:43:45.679 --> 01:43:48.390
<i>And this is me.
I'm Annabel Beam.</i>

01:43:50.601 --> 01:43:52.728
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:55.731
<i>And I say it's all right</i>

01:44:03.655 --> 01:44:09.703
<i>Little darling,
the smiles returning to the faces</i>

01:44:11.163 --> 01:44:16.752
<i>Little darling, it seems like years
since it's been here</i>

01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:20.505
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:24.384
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

01:44:24.468 --> 01:44:27.346
<i>And I say it's all right</i>

01:44:31.725 --> 01:44:33.226
<i>It's all right</i>
