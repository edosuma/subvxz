00:07.174 --> 00:09.635
-Are we going to Montebello?
-Yep.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.262
<i>Times</i> food critic called it
the best new restaurant in Manhattan.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.472
Yelp gave it three stars.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.099
Wow. They practice molecular gastronomy.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.227
-What?
-It's a revolution in fine dining

00:18.310 --> 00:21.188
where chefs use biochemistry
to create new and exotic dishes.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.856
A grill works just fine for me.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.401
Every dish is a work of art.
I'm surprised you chose Montebello.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.403
It's expensive. I'm impressed.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.239
Oh, we're not eating there.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.908
Peter, this is like me
taking you to Yankee Stadium

00:32.991 --> 00:34.826
and listening to the game
in the parking lot.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.537
PETER: It's a meeting place.
I didn't pick it.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.247
-Who did?
-The insurance investigator.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.623
Oh, insurance, great.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.335
Someone stole $100 million
in Japanese bearer bonds.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.878
Samurai bonds, nice.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.797
That's what they're called on the street.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.383
-Oh, now I've got your interest.
-So who's the investigator?

00:49.466 --> 00:51.218
She has a suspect here in Manhattan.

00:51.301 --> 00:55.639
She? Wait, wait, is it… No.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.558
-It is?
-Yep.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.577
Agent Burke, it's nice to see you.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.288
Neal Caffrey, it's been a while.

01:19.371 --> 01:23.917
Sara. Nearly five years since you
testified at my trial… against me.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.544
Well, you did steal a painting insured

01:25.627 --> 01:27.296
by my employer
for several million dollars.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.839
Not according to a jury of my peers.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.507
Your peers were in prison.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.926
-A few of us managed to stay out.
-I could fix that.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.761
I'm sorry to break up this happy reunion,

01:34.845 --> 01:37.055
but we're here to talk
about the samurai bonds.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.391
That's what they call them on the street.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.144
We're not here to talk about them.
We're here to find them.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.562
Girl's gotta make a living.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.565
Well, my fees are based on recovery,
so yeah.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.150
(INAUDIBLE)

01:49.151 --> 01:51.445
-Sara?
-My company, Sterling Bosch,

01:51.528 --> 01:54.031
insured 100 million in non-government
Japanese bearer bonds.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.991
Hundred million yen or US dollars?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.951
-Dollars.
-And if you recover them?

01:58.035 --> 01:59.328
Two percent.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.330
The truck was hijacked in transport.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.873
I think the bonds
are somewhere here in New York.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.083
She believes Edgar Halbridge is involved.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.920
NEAL: Big international real estate guy.
He can move them without raising flags.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.796
Yes, he can. Excuse me.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.343
-Hi, Emilio's just inside.
-Okay.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.136
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.347
Hey, you, that's my car. Get away from it.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.057
Emilio, listen to me.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.227
You can change the VIN numbers.
You can change the grill, the paint.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.811
It's still a Mercedes SLR.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.773
I know because
you did not change the electronic VIN

02:27.856 --> 02:28.899
behind the steering wheel.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.442
You're crazy, you're just stealing my car.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.985
You stole it, I'm taking it back.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.405
Don't make a scene.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.408
(GROANS) Shoot.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.244
You can file a complaint
with my friend from the FBI.

02:40.327 --> 02:44.456
-Ah!
-Hey, hi there. Special Agent Burke, FBI.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.124
This is just a misunderstanding.
I should just…

02:46.208 --> 02:48.085
You should stop walking.
Put your hand above your head.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.628
Yeah, running just annoys him.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.047
Oh, oh.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.258
So you're basically a high-class repo man.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.218
Well, I prefer white-collar bounty hunter.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.761
You should put that on your business card.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.807
This is a limited edition SLR
worth $450,000.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.642
Making your cut $9,000.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.020
-Not a bad score on your lunch break.
-No, it's not.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.481
Speaking of business cards,

03:09.565 --> 03:13.652
when you feel like turning in
that Raphael, please, call me.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.195
I wouldn't wait by the phone.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.865
See you tomorrow, Caffrey.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.826
(TIRES SCREECHING)

03:47.436 --> 03:48.437
It's clear.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.084
Come on.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.140
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.267
Yeah, Kate was sitting on the left side

04:28.810 --> 04:30.187
by the window.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.404
-It was definitely no accident.
-Did you ever think it was?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.031
No.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.408
Mechanical failure
wouldn't cause an explosion by the door.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.495
I bet it was set to explode
the plane in midair.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.455
It went off early.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.333
Or someone set it off early.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.128
What about the black box?

04:55.212 --> 04:56.880
The whole tail's missing.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.926
(WHISPERING) You said
the guard's route takes 15 minutes.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.219
(WHISPERING) That's not the guard.

All right, just follow me on this one.

MAN: What are you doing in here?

05:05.556 --> 05:08.225
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Good morning.
We're with Sterling Bosch.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.685
-You're Roy?
-ROY: Mmm-hmm.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.521
Where you been, Roy?
Unlike you, we're on a schedule here.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.107
-Sterling Bosch? Insurance?
-Yeah.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.775
Well, no one told me you were coming.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.902
I thought Wentlow Holdings
was handling the claim.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.572
They were.
Where's the cockpit voice recorder?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.699
Oh, that's been logged in
with NTSB in Washington.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.577
I hope you made a backup.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.956
-Insurance?
-Just trust me on this.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.499
Listen, how'd you guys get in here?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.960
-We walked in.
-Your security is abysmal.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.837
We have one guard for four hangars.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.630
Good to know.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.799
Listen, we made a copy
of the voice recording.

05:40.883 --> 05:44.511
I only handle the physical evidence.
I don't have access to the recording.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.763
When's our flight leave?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.473
Two hours.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.767
I can have FAA send a copy to you.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.229
-That would work.
-Yeah, I guess that would work.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.773
I'll have them send it to, uh,
Sterling Bosch. What's your name?

05:58.066 --> 06:02.154
You know, why don't you have him send it
to my insurance investigator, Sara Ellis?

06:02.821 --> 06:03.822
I can do that.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.908
Great, I'll follow up
with a call tomorrow morning.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.118
All right. Ask for my assistant.
I'll give her a heads-up.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.953
-Thanks, Roy.
-Bye, Roy.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.417
-Hey, we'll get it.
-Yeah.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.671
-Who's Sara Ellis?
-Oh, you weren't at my trial.

-Oh, that's different.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.683
How can I work with her?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.894
I'm the cunning art thief
who slipped through her fingers.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.395
I don't think she used those words.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.105
No, but she looks at me
and sees dollar signs.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.815
She'll come after me again
for the Raphael.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.484
Do you have it?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.779
Okay, there's a hundred million
in stolen bonds out there.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.114
She knows this case better than anybody.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.492
Right now we're on the same team,
so play nice.

-No. Don't.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.703
-But… Fine.
-Good.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.667
Start a conversation.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.254
Sara, I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot. Let's start over.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.463
-You want to be friends?
-Why not?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.382
Okay, what, coffee, grab a bite?

07:03.465 --> 07:04.591
-Sure.
-How about dinner?

07:04.675 --> 07:06.635
Or maybe a movie.
You like classics, right?

07:06.718 --> 07:09.555
-Good memory.
-Are you worried about her and Neal?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.723
-Not at all.
-You name the date, Neal.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.475
I would love to spend time with you.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.227
Anything to keep you talking.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.106
-You're recording me?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.399
Everything you say to me

07:20.482 --> 07:22.484
can and will be used
to nail your ass to the wall

07:22.568 --> 07:23.819
and recover my painting.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.154
Everything okay, Neal?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.615
What's that?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.785
(LAUGHS) I could get used to this.

07:31.869 --> 07:35.497
PETER: Okay, people.
You know Sara Ellis from Sterling Bosch.

07:35.581 --> 07:39.710
Thanks to her intel,
we have subpoenaed coded e-mails

07:39.793 --> 07:43.922
between an alias
we think is Edgar Halbridge

07:44.006 --> 07:47.384
and a man in Hamburg he calls Mr. Black.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.137
The e-mails use a public key encryption.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.805
We've cracked most of them.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.141
We believe Mr. Black is a courier.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.268
Halbridge has paid him a one-time fee

07:56.351 --> 07:58.854
to enter the US
and get the bonds out of the country.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.148
-The bonds are transferable?
-No title.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.234
-Whoever holds them owns them.
-Each certificate is worth $200 grand.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.695
So a stack of a hundred million dollars
is this thick?

08:08.113 --> 08:10.032
Halbridge is taking a huge risk
using a courier.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.700
I'd take the risk.

08:11.783 --> 08:16.663
The plan is to intercept Mr. Black
when he transfers planes in Toronto.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.875
Then we put Neal into his place
here in Manhattan.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.460
Well, thank you for the heads-up.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.588
You said you cracked most of the e-mails.
What's in the ones you haven't?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.924
-Don't know.
-Halbridge won't recognize Mr. Black?

08:27.007 --> 08:30.719
From the vernacular of the e-mails,
we think he's an American expat.

08:30.802 --> 08:34.473
The last e-mail says Black
will be the guy wearing a leather jacket

08:34.556 --> 08:36.558
and carrying a copy of <i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>

08:36.642 --> 08:38.602
which tells me
he doesn't know what he looks like.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.686
Let's make this happen.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.192
-You're welcome.
-For what?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.819
Well, I recover the bonds,
your cut is $2 million.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.154
Oh.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.198
See, I thought the Bureau needed me,

08:51.281 --> 08:53.742
given their recovery rate
is less than one in 20.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.453
-Is that true?
-That's the Bureau's recovery rate.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.538
Not mine.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.213
PETER: Canadian authorities
have detained Mr. Black in Toronto,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.757
but left his name
on the flight manifest at JFK.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.134
DIANA: As far as Halbridge is concerned,
Black lands in an hour.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.221
We've duplicated his wardrobe
and every item he had on him.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.640
Diesel jacket, leather wallet,
and copy of…

09:16.723 --> 09:19.142
<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i> Mr. Black's a lone wolf.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.271
<i>-Mitternacht süs?</i>
-German chocolate.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.398
Not a fan of the bittersweet.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.109
From the airport,
you'll take a cab to Fort Greene.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.652
You'll wait there
for a car to pick you up.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.946
The location's open.
We'll be back eight blocks.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.906
We can't get closer
without risking our cover.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.285
GPS tracker and voice transmitter
in the watch.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.369
We'll be behind you.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.080
As soon as you see those bonds,
we move in on him.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.248
What's the activation phrase?

09:41.331 --> 09:43.458
You'll say, "Long flight," we'll be there.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.710
"Long flight."

09:44.793 --> 09:47.337
Should I be getting a recovery fee?
Because Sara gets two percent,

09:47.421 --> 09:49.214
and I feel like
I'm doing the heavy lifting here.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.507
Move.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.580
Standing alone by a waste-treatment plant.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.707

10:27.878 --> 10:29.546
Here we go.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.757
Black limo arriving from the south.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.491
Got Mr. Black.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.618
I'll confirm when the job is complete.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.583
Everything is as you requested.
Your gloves, your briefcase.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.589
(ELECTRIC CRACKLING)

11:15.133 --> 11:17.261
-What happened?
-We lost the signal.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.564
Is everything in order?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.483
That is the correct gun?

Yeah.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.111
No GPS, no audio.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.904
What do you mean?
Did he do that or did we?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.739
Neither, looks like someone's jamming it.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.826
Sure was a long flight.

11:41.827 --> 11:42.870
What was that, sir?

11:44.162 --> 11:48.041
Oh, I… I said,
it sure was a long flight. (CLEARS THROAT)

11:48.125 --> 11:50.002
(STATIC)

12:05.851 --> 12:08.812
Ruger Mark 2
with tactical solutions receiver.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.440
Red dot holographic sight. Good.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.901
As you requested.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.236
-Still don't have a visual.
-Get eyes on him.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.530
Neal said he arrived from the south.
Let's use that.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.658
Call NYPD, see if we can rush
in one of their helicopters.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.037
Couldn't carry this with me
on my long flight, could I?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.998
-Everything else is in place.
-That's fantastic.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.585
Okay, get a visual on the black limo,
all bridges, offices in Midtown.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.128
And he lives on the Upper West Side.

12:33.212 --> 12:34.338
Send a team to both.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.757
NYPD can get a chopper
in the air in five minutes,

12:36.840 --> 12:37.966
otherwise we're flying blind.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.843
Great, they got a head start

12:39.927 --> 12:42.554
and we are looking for a black limo
somewhere in Brooklyn.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.600
Everything all right, Mr. Black?

12:47.893 --> 12:49.019
(SIGHS)

13:05.160 --> 13:06.828
-How much farther?
-We're close.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.800
DRIVER: Target's on the first floor.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.468
I'm here if there's any resistance.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.803
Stay here.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.514
Keep the engine running.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.234
Any time you guys want to break
that safe distance you're maintaining,

13:37.317 --> 13:39.695
<i>-I'd appreciate it.</i>
-He's back up.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.993
Have I mentioned how long my flight was?

13:46.076 --> 13:49.204
-Lawrence of Arabia <i>long.</i>
-He's giving us the takedown signal.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.164
-Where is he?
-GPS is coming up.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.332
<i>I hope you guys are close</i>

13:52.416 --> 13:55.043
because I think
I'm supposed to kill somebody.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.211
Did he say, "Kill somebody"?

14:00.966 --> 14:03.468
I'm walking into a house
with a loaded gun.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.761
Please stop me.

14:04.845 --> 14:08.432
<i>My driver has a gun also.</i>
<i>If I</i><i>don't do this, he might.</i>

14:08.515 --> 14:10.642
<i>So I'm gonna go through with this</i>
<i>until you get here.</i>

14:10.726 --> 14:13.353
Found him. 8602 Second Street, Park Slope.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.522
Get a team there now. Who lives there?

14:17.983 --> 14:20.110
-Oh, God.
-Go, go.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.057
-Freeze!
-Wait, don't shoot.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.725
-Caffrey?
-Sara?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.436
Why did he say, "Don't shoot"?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.021
Because she's gonna kill him.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.232
This is because
I won't let the Raphael go.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.025
No, it's not.
This isn't what it looks like.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.652
It looks like you're here to kill me.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.071
Okay, it is what it looks like.
I was sent here to kill you.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.822
-(GUN CLICKS)
-Mr. Black from Hamburg

15:05.906 --> 15:07.783
-isn't a courier, he's an assassin.
-Right.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.868
There's a driver outside, he's armed.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.204
He may come in here
if he doesn't see muzzle flashes.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.456
-I can make that happen.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:15.165 --> 15:16.834
That's probably Peter.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.419
Look, I'm putting the gun down.

15:19.503 --> 15:20.546
Answer the phone.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.175
-This better be Peter.
-PETER: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) <i>It is.</i>

15:25.259 --> 15:27.010
Tell me you haven't shot Caffrey yet.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.346
-No, not yet.
-The flight was long, Peter.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.472
SARA: <i>Who wants me dead?</i>

15:30.556 --> 15:32.933
-Halbridge.
-Peter, is that true?

15:33.016 --> 15:34.726
It looks that way, yes.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.021
We can arrest the driver outside,
work him to get to Halbridge.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.940
That doesn't guarantee
we'll recover the bonds.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.149
What do you suggest?

15:42.401 --> 15:43.819
Let him think I'm dead.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.073
(GUNSHOTS)

15:48.156 --> 15:49.700
Congratulations, Caffrey.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.244
You've killed me.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.126
It's done. Let's go.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.306
PETER: What about the gun?

16:12.389 --> 16:14.683
I left it in the briefcase
for the driver to dispose of.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.977
I know, but apparently
that was part of my plan.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.688
We intercepted the EMTs and NYPD.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.024
We put out reports
that she's confirmed dead.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.901
Where's Sara now?

16:23.984 --> 16:25.861
Jones was taking her to the safe house.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.988
I took her to the safe house.
She didn't want to stay.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.324
-Why not?
-Gentlemen, Neal.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.367
You're really redefining
"business casual."

16:32.451 --> 16:34.661
Hardly recognized you without the Ruger.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.080
-You should step out.
-I think I'll step out.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.375
My files on Halbridge.
Please put them in there.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.087
First things first, I need pants.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.381
Jones, find her some pants.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.307
What are you doing? You okay?
It's been a rough night.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.935
You should get some rest.
We'll talk on the way to the safe house.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.895
-I'm good.
-You're staying?

17:01.230 --> 17:03.607
Peter, I was woken out of a dead sleep

17:03.690 --> 17:05.817
by Neal Caffrey standing
over me with a gun.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.028
I would love to be somewhere I can trust.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.072
-Any progress on the pants?
-Jones?

17:11.782 --> 17:14.243
-Here's your bag.
-Thank you.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.161
-Where are you gonna sleep?
-I will be fine.

17:16.245 --> 17:18.956
Something about an attempt on your life
really gets the blood flowing

17:19.039 --> 17:20.832
like a double shot
of Red Bull and espresso.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.001
I think I just invented a drink.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.796
-You boys got any Scotch?
-(PETER CHUCKLES)

17:26.880 --> 17:28.966
-Get a cot, bring it up here.
-You got it.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.176
It's been a while
since somebody wanted me dead.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.762
Don't look so surprised.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.181
The question is
why does Halbridge want me dead?

17:36.265 --> 17:37.808
Which means what's so special about you?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.434
I play a mean cello.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.103
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-I work for Sterling Bosch.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.855
I can be replaced.

17:42.938 --> 17:47.025
Kill me, another investigator takes over
and Halbridge knows that.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.902
So honestly, why me?

17:48.986 --> 17:51.738
Sara, we'll figure this out.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.115
We are gonna get this guy.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.160
How's the coffee around here?
We have a lot of work to do.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.962
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

18:07.045 --> 18:10.132
Yeah, well, we can't all spend our nights
sipping wine on my couch.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.842
Not with that attitude you can't.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.261
I was a little busy
posing as a professional killer.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.721
As you said.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.514
-Are you tipsy?
-A little bit.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.308
Where's the cockpit recording?

18:19.391 --> 18:21.435
I checked with Roy's office.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.145
The package from the FAA

18:23.228 --> 18:26.940
arrived at Sterling Bosch earlier today,
care of Sara Ellis.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.317
So what happened? Where is it now?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.694
You went and killed her is what happened.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.405
It's under lock and key
while they investigate her "death."

18:33.488 --> 18:35.490
Okay, we'll find a way
into Sterling Bosch.

18:35.574 --> 18:39.870
(SCOFFS) Look, your best chance
is to wait until Sleeping Beauty awakens

18:39.953 --> 18:41.914
from her dirt nap and snag it then.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.668
I'm guessing you're not
her favorite person at this moment.

18:46.752 --> 18:49.379
-No.
-Then I would suggest cozying up to her.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.298
-She put a gun on my face.
-And cocked it?

18:51.381 --> 18:52.424
Yeah.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.260
You've come back from worse.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.149
(WHISTLES)

19:09.233 --> 19:11.109
Love what you've done with the place.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.736
What do you want, Caffrey?

19:12.819 --> 19:16.198
Look, I feel bad about last night,
so I bought you a housewarming gift.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.908
I know how much you've been wanting this.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.912
-The Raphael you stole.
-No.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.206
But it's a nice print of a stolen Raphael.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.542
-It says it right here.
-Homey.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.710
Yeah, and we're working closely
on this case, and…

19:28.794 --> 19:30.504
-(BEEPS)
-Really?

19:32.798 --> 19:35.133
-We gonna keep doing this?
-Really, keep talking.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.844
-'Cause I can go on all day.
-Please.

19:36.927 --> 19:39.721
-Hey, kids, playing nice?
-Neal brought me a gift.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.265
Oh, the Raphael? Cute.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.392
-He wants something.
-I can't get you a present?

19:43.475 --> 19:45.894
When someone like you
gets someone like me a gift,

19:45.978 --> 19:47.354
there's a reason.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.647
Peter, what do you think Neal wants?

19:48.730 --> 19:49.898
He's never given me a present.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.067
-I sent you birthday cards.
-It wasn't a present.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.694
Do you want something from Ms. Ellis?

19:53.777 --> 19:54.987
I want her to stop pointing guns at me.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.323
That can be arranged, sit.
Let's talk about Halbridge.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.576
Sara, why do you think
he wants you out of the way?

20:00.659 --> 20:01.702
I don't know.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.329
What do you have in your files
that we don't have?

20:04.413 --> 20:07.124
Well, I dug deep. Um, stocks, security,

20:07.207 --> 20:09.960
all his land holdings,
tenant lease agreements.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.588
-NEAL: We've already seen all that.
-I believe so.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.674
Mr. Black,
when was the first e-mail sent to him?

20:16.550 --> 20:18.552
Good. Figure out when he arranged the hit.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.555
Yeah, yeah, all right, here it is.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.807
Five weeks ago,
what were you digging into?

20:23.891 --> 20:25.934
Five weeks ago? (EXHALES)

20:27.728 --> 20:29.062
This.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.939
It's Ridgemont.

20:31.023 --> 20:33.942
Ridgemont is an apartment complex
on West End Avenue.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.153
It's the first place that Halbridge lived
when he came to New York.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.613
NEAL: He bought it for nostalgia?

20:37.696 --> 20:40.824
It's a classic six. Maybe Halbridge
is into pre-war architecture.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.827
Maybe. But he's renovated
all his other properties

20:43.911 --> 20:45.245
except for Ridgemont.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.372
There's something there
he doesn't want to let go of.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.082
Yeah, you should ask him.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.959
Doubt he'll discuss it with the FBI.

20:51.043 --> 20:53.003
You think he'd talk to Mr. Black?

21:08.977 --> 21:11.146
DRIVER: If you have a weapon,
I'll take it.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.439
I don't.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.527
-I'm gonna check.
-Hey, get your hands off me.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.612
HALBRIDGE: It's all right, Nico.

21:18.695 --> 21:22.950
What is so important
that you need to see me in person?

21:23.033 --> 21:24.743
You want to do this in front of him?

21:24.826 --> 21:26.787
I'm more comfortable that he stays.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.209
Did you enjoy your trip to New York?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.710
It isn't over yet.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.295
(CHUCKLES) It should be.

21:36.505 --> 21:39.842
Your business,
as I understand it, is complete.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.220
Not quite.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.390
I'm here to talk about Ridgemont.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.101
That supposed to mean something?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.727
You hired me to kill a woman.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.020
This conversation is over.

21:52.104 --> 21:55.274
I asked myself, "Why kill her?"
She must mean something to you.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.359
So before I took care of her,
we had a little talk,

21:57.442 --> 21:59.152
and she had a lot to say
about Ridgemont Apartments.

21:59.236 --> 22:04.074
If you're insinuating
that I had some woman killed,

22:04.157 --> 22:06.243
what makes you think
that I won't have you killed

22:06.326 --> 22:07.661
right where you sit?

22:11.748 --> 22:13.208
That crossed my mind.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.798
Here's what happens now.

22:19.882 --> 22:23.135
You're going to transfer
$2 million into my account.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.096
You got 48 hours
or the FBI gets a call telling them

22:26.180 --> 22:29.016
to look into any connection between you
and Ridgemont Apartments.

22:29.099 --> 22:32.728
Liquidating $2 million in assets
will take some time.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.897
You're a wealthy and resourceful man.
You'll think of something.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.273
If I don't?

22:38.066 --> 22:39.234
(BULLET CLINKS)

22:39.318 --> 22:41.195
You got a lot more to lose than I do.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.381
We were right. Ridgemont was the way in.

23:01.465 --> 23:05.969
Good. Jones, Diana, keep monitoring
Halbridge's phones and assets.

23:06.053 --> 23:08.931
There are plenty of places
to plant a bug in his house…

23:09.014 --> 23:10.182
if you want to go that way.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.935
You're playing with guns,
I'm not letting you back in there.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.019
Just let that simmer.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.522
What happens if he actually transfers
the two mil to Mr. Black?

23:16.605 --> 23:18.106
Be a good day for Mr. Black.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.942
PETER: I've got a team watching Ridgemont.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.360
If Halbridge makes a move,

23:21.443 --> 23:22.986
we'll figure out
what's so important in there.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.204
MOZZIE: Now, explain to me
why your hair was slicked back.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.122
Amateur production of <i>Grease?</i>

23:34.206 --> 23:36.625
I do think you'd make
a sublime Danny Zuko.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.377
Mmm. Not Kenickie?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.420
MOZZIE: Oh, please, you're not a follower.

23:40.504 --> 23:41.964
I went back under as a hit man.

23:42.047 --> 23:45.092
Ah, can't keep yourself
from terrorizing Sara.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.719
No, we're trying to force
a suspect into…

23:48.679 --> 23:49.847
Why are you still here?

23:49.930 --> 23:51.765
Oh, you have a better
wine selection than I do.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.308
Love your honesty.

23:53.392 --> 23:55.519
Truth is the first chapter
in the book of wisdom

23:55.602 --> 23:57.563
and this Malbec is a little dry.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.065
I've gotta get back to the Bureau.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.817
So any progress with Sara?

24:01.900 --> 24:03.986
Well, she's still camped out
in the conference room.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.530
Still? Where's she sleeping?

24:07.781 --> 24:09.366
She's sleeping in the conference room?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.326
Her bed's tucked into the corner.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.412
She had Jones drag in half her wardrobe.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.581
Well, I guess you can take it with you.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.374
Sounds like she's in for the long haul.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.876
-I guess.
-That can't be fun.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.460
For her or for us?

24:20.544 --> 24:23.672
Either. The suit can't force her
into a hotel?

24:23.755 --> 24:25.090
Oh, Peter agreed to this.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.925
She's under protection
so she can't leave the building.

24:27.009 --> 24:30.262
(EXHALES) You can't crack a window
and no room service?

24:30.345 --> 24:32.598
I mean, seriously,
who can survive like that?

24:48.697 --> 24:50.449
Coffee for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.075
I heard Halbridge bit.

24:52.159 --> 24:55.412
Yeah, we got a team at Ridgemont.
How's everything going with you?

24:56.663 --> 24:59.291
I hate this coffee.
I hate eating food out of foil.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.585
-And the air in here is stale.
-Cabin fever.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.629
I'm very sick of this place.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.047
We should get you some fresh air.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.633
Well, that's a little hard
when you can't leave the FBI.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.343
Oh, come on.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.053
You gotta think outside the box.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.185
SARA: Hmm. The roof.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.771
-Yeah, it's still the FBI.
-Yeah.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.731
You know the secret to living with rules?

25:22.814 --> 25:24.525
Finding ways to bend them?

25:24.608 --> 25:25.859
Exactly.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.821
Well, go on. I'm fascinated.

25:29.905 --> 25:31.156
I'm not gonna tell you about the painting.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.491
That's too bad.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.076
You know what they say about curiosity.

25:34.910 --> 25:37.079
Curiosity can't kill me
if I'm already dead.

25:37.162 --> 25:39.998
-So, what's it like?
-Hmm. Being dead?

25:40.082 --> 25:41.208
NEAL: Mmm.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.585
So far, it's what I imagine
prison must be like.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.462
You're equating prison and death?

25:46.296 --> 25:48.715
I'm sorry,
I forgot I was talking to an expert.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.051
Cue the violins, Neal.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.886
You've got two miles,
I have a conference room.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.972
Aw, you're indoors for two days.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.807
I got this for four years.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.684
Do you really want to keep doing this?

25:58.767 --> 26:00.435
No, not really.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.441
-NEAL: Beautiful.
-Yeah.

26:07.693 --> 26:08.861
Nothing's changed.

26:11.363 --> 26:13.115
I'm dead.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.534
The city looks the same.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.952
As far as the world knows,

26:17.035 --> 26:19.371
you're no longer in it
but it keeps turning.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.916
Yeah, certain things…

26:23.000 --> 26:24.126
Humble you?

26:26.211 --> 26:28.255
Well, I was gonna say
"really piss me off,"

26:28.338 --> 26:29.548
-but, okay, yeah, sure.
-(CHUCKLING)

26:29.631 --> 26:31.091
-Humble me.
-All right.

26:32.009 --> 26:34.136
Oh, what, your passing
didn't make a big enough splash?

26:34.219 --> 26:35.721
A girl can hope.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.266
-Parents?
-Deceased.

26:39.349 --> 26:41.101
-Brothers and sisters?
-Only child.

26:41.185 --> 26:42.895
-Goldfish?
-No.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.399
What do you want from me, Caffrey?

26:47.482 --> 26:50.027
-Who says I want anything?
-I do.

26:50.110 --> 26:53.238
You're a con man. You smile for a living.

26:54.239 --> 26:57.743
And you're smiling at me right now,
so I know that you want something.

26:58.202 --> 26:59.536
All right.

27:01.121 --> 27:04.374
I would love
for you to pass me that fortune cookie.

27:12.925 --> 27:13.926
You first.

27:14.843 --> 27:16.762
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

27:16.845 --> 27:19.932
Apparently, excitement
and intrigue follow me.

27:20.015 --> 27:22.559
-How about you?
-I make delicious soups.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.522
-Confucius has you pegged.
-It's true, actually, I do.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.232
-Yeah?
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

27:36.615 --> 27:38.242
-He took the bait?
<i>-Yep.</i>

27:40.035 --> 27:41.745
Halbridge is digging up Ridgemont.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.331
I'll toast to that.

28:04.184 --> 28:06.061

Come on, quick, we gotta get…

28:13.068 --> 28:14.862
PETER: FBI.
MAN 1: Get this done.

28:14.945 --> 28:18.323
I need everyone to put their tools down
and step two feet away from the hole.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.242
AGENT: Put it down.
MAN 1: All right, down here.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.743

-Oh, hey.
-AGENT: Ready to open it up?

28:30.252 --> 28:32.629
-Can't be our bonds.
-No.

28:32.713 --> 28:35.799
Whatever Halbridge is hiding
has been here for years.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.677
He's bound to have more than
one skeleton in his closet.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.388
-AGENT: Agent Burke, open it?
-Yeah, go ahead, get it open.

right about those skeletons.

Mmm.

ELIZABETH: (ON PHONE)
<i>How's the case going?</i>

29:01.116 --> 29:04.494
We're making headway.
We just dug up some new evidence.

29:04.578 --> 29:06.538
That was some sort of pun, wasn't it?

29:06.622 --> 29:09.499
I could've also said,
"We found a body of evidence."

29:09.583 --> 29:11.418
<i>I get it. You're very, very funny.</i>

29:11.502 --> 29:14.546
I'm here all week.
Don't forget to tip your waitress.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.299
(GIGGLES) So does that mean
that Sara gets to go home?

29:17.382 --> 29:19.218
<i>Soon, I hope.</i>

29:19.301 --> 29:20.802
Well, have you talked to her?

29:20.886 --> 29:22.179
Yeah, I'm gonna update her now.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.764
<i>No, I meant have you talked to her?</i>

29:23.847 --> 29:25.474
Like a person.

29:25.557 --> 29:26.600
I'm not a shrink.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.602
<i>You've got a pretty good</i>

29:28.685 --> 29:32.022

-All right, you twisted my arm.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.233
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

29:43.367 --> 29:46.078
Hey, how you doing?

29:46.161 --> 29:47.829
Me? I'm good, I'm fine.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.624
That's a nice outfit. Going somewhere?

29:50.707 --> 29:53.293
No. No, I'm just pretending.

29:53.377 --> 29:55.170
Dress how you want to feel, right?

29:55.254 --> 29:56.421
PETER: Hmm.

29:56.505 --> 29:58.257
Neal came by. We had a nice little chat.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.175
-Is he in one piece?
-Yes, I left him whole.

30:00.259 --> 30:02.636
-Good, I prefer him that way.
-Yeah.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.221
These flowers from him?

30:04.304 --> 30:09.309
Um, no, my company sent these
to the funeral home for me.

30:09.393 --> 30:10.853
Oh.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.230
We had everything forwarded
from the funeral home.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.940
-It's evidence.
-Yeah.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.817
It's carnations.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.987
That's all I'm worth.
It might as well be weeds.

30:20.070 --> 30:22.406
Well, I don't think that's fair
to carnations.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.367
Well, you gotta admit
they brighten up the place.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.869
(CHUCKLES)

30:28.704 --> 30:30.581
Did you find anything at Ridgemont?

30:30.664 --> 30:31.832
A body.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.043
-Ah… Whose?
-I don't know yet.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.212
The clothing's from the mid-'80s.

30:37.296 --> 30:41.175
Looks like a blunt force to the head.
No ID, no direct links to Halbridge.

30:41.258 --> 30:43.385
-Okay, well, then what can I do?
-Nothing.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.554
Tonight you can rest.

30:45.637 --> 30:47.264
That's what you can do.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.433
When this thing is over, you…

30:50.976 --> 30:52.686
You can get back to your life.

30:54.646 --> 30:57.357
Maybe find something
that doesn't fit in these boxes.

30:57.983 --> 31:01.445
Oh, all right.
You're getting paid by the hour now.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.113
Okay.

31:03.197 --> 31:05.199
My advice?

31:05.282 --> 31:07.618
Get a life. You work too hard.

31:07.701 --> 31:08.785
And you don't?

31:08.869 --> 31:10.162
Hmm.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.539
What is it they say?
"We can sleep when we're dead"?

31:12.623 --> 31:15.000
It's a good idea. You're dead.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.044
-So get some rest.
-(CHUCKLES)

31:17.127 --> 31:19.880
Forensic will be here tomorrow.

31:19.963 --> 31:22.341
And you can jump back in then.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.634
Okay.

31:37.064 --> 31:38.398
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

31:39.816 --> 31:42.027
All right, I'll make us coffee.

31:49.076 --> 31:51.161
PETER: Oh, yeah, right?
SARA: Right.

31:51.245 --> 31:53.539
-Yeah, the way that S moves like that.
-SARA: Yeah.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.168
-Yeah.
-Very similar.

31:58.252 --> 32:00.712
-Did I miss a memo?
-No.

32:00.796 --> 32:02.589
NEAL: Were we starting earlier?

32:02.673 --> 32:05.509
Forensics came back this morning
with an ID on the body.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.427
-And?
-You're gonna love this.

32:07.511 --> 32:12.766
The body buried under Ridgemont
was identified as one Edgar Halbridge.

32:12.850 --> 32:14.476
-Halbridge is the corpse?
-Yep.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.854
So the man we know as
Edgar Halbridge is an imposter.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.313
-Yep.
-Who is he, then?

32:18.397 --> 32:20.774
We spent the morning comparing
a recent signature of Halbridge's

32:20.858 --> 32:23.193
to signatures from
every Ridgemont Apartment lease

32:23.277 --> 32:24.653
from the early to mid-'80s.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.530
We found a pretty good match.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.448
Steve Price.

32:28.532 --> 32:29.741
He was a tenant at Ridgemont

32:29.825 --> 32:31.994
at the same time
the real Halbridge was living there.

32:32.077 --> 32:34.788
So you think Price killed Halbridge
and took his identity. Why?

32:34.872 --> 32:38.917
The real Halbridge had no family,
but was coming into some serious cash

32:39.001 --> 32:40.878
from an inheritance. Price was poor.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.422
So Price knocks him off
and then steals his identity.

32:43.505 --> 32:47.050
Halbridge's body is lying there
at Ridgemont, driving Price crazy.

32:47.134 --> 32:49.261
-His own <i>Tell-Tale Heart.</i>
-God.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.512
-Yep.
-What?

32:50.596 --> 32:52.764
Peter told me you would bring up
<i>The Tell-Tale Heart.</i>

32:52.848 --> 32:56.518
Oh. I'm glad my grasp of gothic fiction
is a source of amusement for you.

32:56.602 --> 32:58.020
He buys the property,

32:58.103 --> 32:59.938
it isn't worth the risk
of digging up the body.

33:00.022 --> 33:02.733
So he cements over it
and makes sure no one ever digs there.

33:02.816 --> 33:06.111
You start poking around Ridgemont.
That's why he wants you killed.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.446
I like it.

33:08.405 --> 33:09.448
In theory.

33:09.531 --> 33:11.408
Yeah, but that's all it is, a theory.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.952
We've got the signature,
but it isn't definitive.

33:14.036 --> 33:16.038
No, if we're gonna prove murder one,

33:16.121 --> 33:17.789
-we're gonna need more evidence.
-(GROANS)

33:17.873 --> 33:19.666
-Thank you, pay up.
-We had a bet.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.668
I told her at some point you'd say,
"We need more evidence."

33:21.752 --> 33:24.254
-We do.
-And we still don't have the bonds.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.548
What if we kill two birds, so to speak?

33:26.632 --> 33:30.302
Make Halbridge admit he's Steve Price
and reveal the bonds.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.470
Great. What's the plan?

33:31.553 --> 33:33.722
How would you feel
about coming back from the dead?

33:47.110 --> 33:50.072
This is what you found
underneath one of my buildings?

33:50.155 --> 33:52.032
-It is.
-How did they die?

33:52.115 --> 33:53.158
We think it was murder.

33:54.034 --> 33:55.369
Unfortunate.

33:56.370 --> 33:59.456
Have you had any luck identifying it?

33:59.540 --> 34:03.126
Not yet. We'll know more
when the lab work comes back,

34:03.210 --> 34:05.712
which takes weeks
with older remains like this.

34:05.796 --> 34:09.091
I was hoping that
you might be able to help us.

34:09.174 --> 34:13.178
I bought the building 20 years ago.

34:13.262 --> 34:14.346
It's before my time.

34:14.429 --> 34:17.683
There is one thing
you might be able to help us with.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.770
I assume you recognize this woman.

34:23.313 --> 34:25.232
-Do I?
-You should.

34:25.315 --> 34:30.028
Sara Ellis, insurance investigator
working with Sterling Bosch.

34:30.112 --> 34:33.448
She was investigating you
concerning stolen bearer bonds.

34:33.532 --> 34:35.450
Ah. Yes.

34:35.534 --> 34:39.621
I read about her recent misfortune.
What did she, uh, have to do with this?

34:39.705 --> 34:41.582
Does, present tense.

34:42.499 --> 34:46.712
This photo was taken yesterday.
It appears she's alive.

34:47.838 --> 34:49.131
Her death was faked.

34:49.214 --> 34:50.632
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

34:52.259 --> 34:54.261
-Why would she do that?
-I don't know.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.014
But she was the one
who tipped us off about the body.

34:57.097 --> 35:00.976
We think that she's working with this man.

35:02.769 --> 35:05.189
-You know him?
-What's his name?

35:06.106 --> 35:07.399
Steve Price.

35:08.734 --> 35:10.903
That may be an alias. We're not sure.

35:10.986 --> 35:12.696
Does the name ring a bell?

35:14.948 --> 35:16.867
-Steve.
-PETER: Price.

35:19.453 --> 35:21.413
-No.
-Mmm.

35:21.496 --> 35:24.875
Well, we think these two
might be targeting you in some way.

35:25.834 --> 35:28.337
If something comes up, please let me know.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.838
We're here to help.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.549
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.676
-Keep those photos.
-I will.

35:42.559 --> 35:44.019
(INTERCOM BEEPS)

35:44.102 --> 35:45.896
Nico, get in here.

35:49.942 --> 35:52.653
You're getting better
at planting bugs than Caffrey.

35:52.736 --> 35:54.279
-He's talking?
-Yep.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.575
HALBRIDGE: <i>He played me.</i>
<i>They both played me.</i>

35:58.659 --> 36:00.118
NICO: <i>How could they know about the body?</i>

36:00.202 --> 36:02.496
HALBRIDGE: <i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but they know who I am.</i>

36:02.579 --> 36:05.666
<i>-Oh, it's time to move.</i>
-Got him.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.709
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:10.337 --> 36:11.922
-Did it work?
-It worked.

36:12.005 --> 36:15.592
Wine, please. Bringing Sara
back from the dead was brilliant.

36:15.676 --> 36:17.010
Sterling Bosch release the mail?

36:17.094 --> 36:19.721
You had a very specific Syrah here
that I wanted to try,

36:19.805 --> 36:20.848
but it's gone missing.

36:20.931 --> 36:23.183
I drank it. The pinot is fine.
Mozz, the mail.

36:23.267 --> 36:24.601
Yes, they released it.

36:24.685 --> 36:28.730
The package from the FAA
containing the cockpit voice recording

36:28.814 --> 36:31.859
is now sitting amidst a pile
of envelopes on her desk,

36:31.942 --> 36:34.486
or so I was told
by a very perky assistant.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.238
Good.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.240
So how are you gonna get it from her?

36:38.323 --> 36:40.993
If we take Halbridge down,
the first thing Sara's gonna want to do

36:41.076 --> 36:42.286
is get out of that FBI building.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.496
An impulse I understand.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.039
Sterling Bosch is on the way home.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.666
Think she'll stop and pick up her mail?

36:47.749 --> 36:49.418
She's a workaholic,
and everybody likes mail.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.669
This is true.

36:51.962 --> 36:55.674
To the unopened package
and the tantalizing mystery it contains.

36:55.757 --> 36:57.009
NEAL: Huh.

36:57.509 --> 36:59.469
-You want me to steal it?
-She has a gun.

36:59.553 --> 37:00.762
Is it still pointing at you?

37:00.846 --> 37:02.973
No. I think I've convinced her
I'm not trying to kill her anymore.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.474
Well, you are a charmer.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.646
I think I've got a plan

37:09.730 --> 37:11.940
that's a little less illegal
than breaking and entering.

37:12.024 --> 37:13.817
-What do you need?
-A car.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.527
-You don't drive.
-I don't drive often.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.571
Do you think the lady
will accept a ride from you?

37:17.654 --> 37:19.364
Beats packing everything into a cab.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.408
I drink to your charm, sir.

37:25.621 --> 37:27.039
TELLER: Did you get everything you need?

37:27.122 --> 37:28.916
-HALBRIDGE: Yes, I did.
-Thank you, Mr. Price.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.125
Of course.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.503
Steve Price?

37:34.379 --> 37:35.547
FBI.

37:35.631 --> 37:36.924
Did this man remove something

37:37.007 --> 37:39.176
from a security box
belonging to Steve Price?

37:39.259 --> 37:41.345
-Yes.
-Can I see some ID?

37:45.390 --> 37:47.392
I think you'll find everything's in order.

37:50.938 --> 37:53.815
-Excuse me.
-Where you headed, Steve?

37:53.899 --> 37:56.527
You're under arrest
for the murder of Edgar Halbridge.

37:57.402 --> 37:58.612
I wonder what's in here.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.573
Ah, goldfish.

38:02.616 --> 38:03.784
These are pretty.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.955
-Got them.
-Thank God.

38:08.038 --> 38:10.832
I can finally take a shower
that doesn't involve a sink.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.292
Huh… For some reason

38:12.376 --> 38:14.545
I imagined the FBI had showers
somewhere in the building.

38:14.628 --> 38:17.464
It's funny how we have these mental images
that don't always match reality.

38:17.548 --> 38:19.508
Huh. Get me a cab.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.176
Well, I'm headed that way.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.762
You have a car now?

38:23.846 --> 38:25.389
Which agent's ride are you about to steal?

38:25.472 --> 38:27.432
Borrow. I'll leave a note and everything.

38:27.516 --> 38:29.351
-Mmm-hmm.
-I'll get the Raphael.

38:29.434 --> 38:30.978
-Yes.
-I don't want you to forget it.

38:32.145 --> 38:33.856
You don't pack light, do you?

38:48.245 --> 38:49.872
Found a gun on the driver.

38:49.955 --> 38:52.416
Any luck on suitcase
with the gun they gave Neal?

38:52.499 --> 38:55.085
-Nothing, maybe they dumped it.
-Keep looking.

38:55.169 --> 38:56.420
Okay.

39:06.597 --> 39:07.723
Where's Mr. Black?

39:07.806 --> 39:09.600
-The Canadians are holding him.
-You sure?

39:09.683 --> 39:11.059
-Last we checked.
-Find out.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.567
Mr. Black, he's here, isn't he?

39:20.611 --> 39:24.198
Your boss got a pricey lawyer.
I don't recall him saying you got one.

39:26.325 --> 39:29.286
Do you want to be charged as an accessory
to another murder

39:29.369 --> 39:30.621
or do you want to talk to me?

39:30.704 --> 39:33.290
Peter, the Canadians
released Black 12 hours ago.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.125
They didn't have anything
to charge him with.

39:35.209 --> 39:38.879
Oh, damn it. He was in your car.
Where is he now?

39:41.131 --> 39:42.758
He came back to finish the job.

39:44.468 --> 39:45.719
Where's Sara?

39:54.603 --> 39:55.896
Where do you want these?

39:55.979 --> 39:57.898
Oh, um, you can just
put them right back there.

39:57.981 --> 39:58.982
Thank you.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.570
(SIGHS) You know, Neal,
for an art thief…

40:03.654 --> 40:05.405
Alleged art thief.

40:05.489 --> 40:09.826
Yeah. For an art thief,
you certainly have your moments.

40:11.537 --> 40:12.704
(SARA GRUNTS)

40:12.788 --> 40:16.208
Oh, I doubt you'll be saying that
after a shower and a few hours of sleep.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.626
Yeah, you're probably right.

40:18.877 --> 40:21.630
Oh, brother, it never ends.

40:24.216 --> 40:25.968
What is this?

40:55.372 --> 40:56.373
NEAL: Hey.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.502
SARA: Drop it now.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.796
I said, drop it.

41:03.505 --> 41:05.132
I'd listen to her if I were you.

41:09.678 --> 41:10.679
(KICKS GUN)

41:11.555 --> 41:13.015
Get him out of here.

41:13.098 --> 41:14.600

41:16.935 --> 41:19.354
-What are you doing here?
-She needed a ride.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.902
NEAL: Excitement and intrigue.

41:24.985 --> 41:26.361
They follow me wherever I go.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.779
That's probably true for both of us.

41:27.863 --> 41:30.741
Yeah. Looking forward to trying that soup.

41:32.910 --> 41:34.203
Soup?

41:41.376 --> 41:42.628
PETER: Neal?
