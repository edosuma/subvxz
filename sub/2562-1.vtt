02:51.495 --> 02:54.866
731 arriving at Lockup 16.
Prisoner on board.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.729
- Request assistance.
- Affirmative. Proceed to Bay 2.

03:06.113 --> 03:07.316
This is Thrasher.

03:07.416 --> 03:10.186
All units be on the lookout
for Detective Stone.

03:10.286 --> 03:12.223
He's armed and dangerous.

03:12.323 --> 03:14.825
If anyone spots him,
report to me immediately.

03:14.925 --> 03:16.660
Durkin, where the hell are you?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.600
I've located Stone,
passing Trafalgar Square.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.696
On his tail, sir.

03:22.936 --> 03:27.042
While the United States blocks yet
another UN resolution on global warming...

03:27.142 --> 03:28.978
London continues to suffer...

03:29.078 --> 03:33.518
as the River Thames rises to its highest
level since Black November, 1999.

03:33.618 --> 03:36.322
With the approaching full moon
and persistent rains...

03:36.422 --> 03:39.692
the further outlook
for Londoners appears bleak.

03:39.792 --> 03:44.030
As the tides continue to rise,
the dramatic increase in rat infestation...

03:44.130 --> 03:46.134
is evident throughout the city.

03:46.234 --> 03:49.304
Those attacked should report
to their local rodent center...

03:49.404 --> 03:52.130
for immediate medical attention.

05:26.299 --> 05:28.092
Police, dickhead.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.709
Â£50, two drinks minimum.

05:56.807 --> 05:58.701
- Watch him.
- Okay.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.269
Damn it.

06:35.656 --> 06:39.055
- What can I get you?
- You got coffee?

06:39.228 --> 06:41.199
It's two drinks minimum.

06:41.299 --> 06:44.434
Give me two coffees, extra sugar.

06:54.182 --> 06:55.781
Access code.

06:59.555 --> 07:03.426
- Special Unit, can I help you?
- Get me Pat O'Donnell please.

07:03.526 --> 07:05.719
One moment, I'll transfer you.

07:06.531 --> 07:08.131
Come on, Pat.

07:09.935 --> 07:13.240
Excuse me, please, I have to pee.
Will you watch the door for me?

07:13.340 --> 07:16.009
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.111
Don't be a creep and peek, okay?

07:21.216 --> 07:23.853
- O'Donnell, here.
- Hi, Pat. This is Stone, here.

07:23.953 --> 07:27.224
- Don't call me, you were just suspended.
- Did you get the report yet?

07:27.324 --> 07:30.060
No, maybe the bastard
won't show this time.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.920
He'll show.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.524
I know he will.

07:36.638 --> 07:40.536
I need some coffee.
Where the fuck is my coffee?

07:53.126 --> 07:55.089
I know you're here.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.513
Son of a bitch.

08:46.061 --> 08:48.026
Freeze! Don't move.

08:48.765 --> 08:50.866
Show me your hands, man.

08:54.774 --> 08:57.168
Somebody must have seen something.

08:58.077 --> 08:59.471
You?

09:07.758 --> 09:09.983
You know something.

09:10.361 --> 09:12.494
What about you, dickhead?

09:13.499 --> 09:14.867
I know.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.033
I know you saw him.

09:39.866 --> 09:42.262
- Where did he go?
- Don't shoot!

09:42.770 --> 09:45.531
- Talk to me!
- I didn't see anything!

09:45.706 --> 09:47.603
- Freeze!
- Police!

09:48.577 --> 09:50.406
Get out of my way!

10:04.966 --> 10:06.859
God!

10:14.003 --> 10:16.195
I can hear your heartbeat.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.599
I'll find you.

10:23.782 --> 10:25.210
You fuck!

10:34.230 --> 10:35.197
Then what?

10:35.297 --> 10:37.668
He started raving like a lunatic,
out of control.

10:37.768 --> 10:39.870
It took four officers to subdue him.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.838
- Where is he now?
- Lockup.

10:41.938 --> 10:43.368
What happened to him?

10:43.608 --> 10:47.246
A serial killer murdered his partner,
Foster, three years ago.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.948
He was there when it happened.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.513
- Survivor's guilt.
- Just plain guilt.

10:52.687 --> 10:55.357
Had an affair
with Foster's wife, left her...

10:55.457 --> 10:57.827
hit the booze, went over the edge.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.893
Now he lives on anxiety,
coffee and chocolate.

11:01.031 --> 11:03.257
If you ask me, he's nuts.

11:03.902 --> 11:07.561
That's what the doctors say.
Here, read the file.

11:08.174 --> 11:12.179
He's worked in every hellhole in the world
and been fired from all of them.

11:12.279 --> 11:15.540
- They say he's the best.
- He is.

11:16.252 --> 11:19.555
I followed him down an alleyway.
He shot a trashcan.

11:19.655 --> 11:21.517
Sounds like Stone.

11:21.859 --> 11:25.730
- Maybe you'll be a soothing influence.
- Pardon me?

11:25.830 --> 11:27.624
He's your new partner.

11:31.470 --> 11:34.037
What's the matter with you, Stone?

11:34.207 --> 11:37.538
- Where's my other piece, Pat?
- You mean the cannon.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.448
The Chief's got that.

11:39.548 --> 11:42.377
He said he wanted to see you,
said it was urgent.

11:48.627 --> 11:50.089
Hiya, Stone!

11:53.834 --> 11:55.524
Get a move on.

12:04.715 --> 12:07.611
- Careful, sweetheart.
- It's good to have you back.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.547
What the fuck are you doing here?

12:33.519 --> 12:35.880
I thought you were suspended.

12:46.903 --> 12:49.436
Stone, get your ass in here!

13:06.663 --> 13:10.995
- What the fuck's this?
- Hi, Chief. How are you doing?

13:11.369 --> 13:13.503
Answer the question.

13:14.307 --> 13:15.906
It's a gun.

13:16.643 --> 13:19.004
Don't be a smart-ass. This isn't funny.

13:19.313 --> 13:21.174
I'm not laughing.

13:22.251 --> 13:24.180
The killer is back.

13:25.187 --> 13:28.084
I thought you said
this guy wouldn't be back.

13:28.192 --> 13:32.097
Sir, all research shows that a serial killer
of this type doesn't come back.

13:32.197 --> 13:35.368
- Who is this?
- Detective Dick Durkin.

13:35.768 --> 13:38.305
- Are you sure it's him?
- He ripped her heart out.

13:38.405 --> 13:42.235
- Her heart? What for?
- Maybe he eats them for breakfast.

13:46.249 --> 13:48.452
This wasn't in the police reports
or the papers.

13:48.552 --> 13:51.450
It's never going to be. You got that?

13:51.688 --> 13:54.926
Jesus, if they get wind of this,
they'll have a field day.

13:55.026 --> 13:56.957
This changes things.

13:57.430 --> 14:00.467
I thought we were dealing
with a psychotic, not a psychopath.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.703
With such incredible strength,
he must be...

14:02.803 --> 14:05.807
under extreme mental distress
or on some kind of stimulant.

14:05.907 --> 14:07.473
Who is this?

14:08.677 --> 14:12.716
I'm curious. How did you know he was
going to strike at that club last night?

14:12.816 --> 14:13.785
I didn't.

14:13.885 --> 14:16.521
- But you were there before he struck.
- So?

14:16.621 --> 14:19.256
That's an incredible coincidence.

14:19.960 --> 14:24.292
Do you know what this is?
It's a medical report on you.

14:26.535 --> 14:31.196
The doctors say you have anxiety neurosis
to the point of being paranoid.

14:31.408 --> 14:33.634
Doctors don't know shit.

14:33.979 --> 14:36.977
How many weapons are you carrying,
besides this cannon?

14:37.817 --> 14:40.178
- An MP-15.
- What else?

14:41.288 --> 14:43.115
- A Glock 50.
- And?

14:43.957 --> 14:46.262
An A-3 assault shotgun.

14:46.362 --> 14:50.123
If that's not paranoid,
I don't know what the fuck is.

14:50.867 --> 14:53.534
I'm surprised you don't have
a grenade launcher.

14:53.704 --> 14:56.965
- I couldn't get a permit.
- This isn't funny!

15:00.713 --> 15:03.575
- I just want to be ready.
- Ready for what?

15:04.351 --> 15:07.022
You can't even find the bastard,
let alone shoot him.

15:07.122 --> 15:08.523
I can find him.

15:08.623 --> 15:10.927
If you know so much about this fella...

15:11.027 --> 15:13.630
how come we've got a corpse
with her heart ripped out?

15:13.730 --> 15:16.991
And you're up alleyways
shooting at water rats.

15:18.603 --> 15:21.967
- Have you been following me?
- Damn right, he has.

15:22.543 --> 15:25.546
Paranoid people with guns
are a menace to society.

15:25.646 --> 15:29.084
You'd be paranoid, too, if you had
a dipshit like this following you.

15:29.184 --> 15:32.321
This dipshit happens to be
an expert on serial killers.

15:32.421 --> 15:36.390
If he's such an expert,
what the fuck is he following me for?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.896
You're officially off suspension.

15:44.571 --> 15:45.739
But if you fuck up again...

15:45.839 --> 15:49.177
I'll have your arse shipped
to the worst hellhole on this planet.

15:49.277 --> 15:51.343
Worse than this place?

15:51.580 --> 15:54.944
And there's a condition, Stone,
my condition.

15:55.485 --> 15:57.346
He goes with you.

15:58.289 --> 15:59.690
I work alone.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.629
You work with who I say,
or you don't work at all.

16:02.729 --> 16:06.167
'Cause as far as I'm concerned,
you're just another crazy with a gun.

16:06.267 --> 16:09.459
Your concern for my welfare is touching.

16:10.605 --> 16:13.036
Get the fuck out of my office.

16:19.117 --> 16:20.945
You got a pen?

16:25.825 --> 16:29.062
Detective Dick Durkin, you got a car?

16:29.162 --> 16:32.663
- Yeah, of course.
- You take yours, I'll take mine.

16:33.769 --> 16:36.097
Hey, Stone. What's this?

16:36.472 --> 16:39.073
- Are you going on a picnic?
- What, pal?

16:39.276 --> 16:41.877
Having your own booze delivered now?

16:43.849 --> 16:47.254
- Don't touch it! Where did you get this?
- Somebody wheeled it in.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.419
- Who did?
- I don't know.

16:49.724 --> 16:52.291
Did anybody see who delivered this?

16:52.661 --> 16:54.159
Nobody?

16:54.497 --> 16:55.532
Don't.

16:55.632 --> 16:57.101
- It's cold.
- What?

16:57.201 --> 17:00.336
- Cold enough to be full of beers?
- What's going on?

17:06.045 --> 17:07.270
All right.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.739
Open it.

17:24.369 --> 17:26.002
Paranoid?

17:26.672 --> 17:28.534
Seal off the building. Now!

17:30.176 --> 17:31.435
It's too late.

17:31.579 --> 17:35.419
Get Forensics on this.
I wanna know who delivered it and when.

17:35.761 --> 17:38.294
Durkin, stick with him.

17:38.799 --> 17:42.698
I want a mold from these teeth imprints,
and I want them now!

17:48.579 --> 17:49.769
Hi.

17:51.015 --> 17:53.150
Can I ask you something?

17:53.452 --> 17:55.589
Where'd you get your training?

17:55.689 --> 17:59.227
I come from Lochgilphead in Argyll,
but we moved to Glasgow when I was 4.

17:59.327 --> 18:02.866
I got my first degree there,
then I did postgraduate in Edinburgh...

18:02.966 --> 18:06.658
and after I decided to join the police,
I went to Oxford.

18:08.938 --> 18:10.471
Stay there.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.069
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.403
What the hell are you doing here?

19:01.808 --> 19:06.379
- I'm trying to think. Do you mind?
- You must be sick, laying in wet blood.

19:09.585 --> 19:13.383
You saw him, didn't you? I know you did.

19:14.225 --> 19:18.193
You can see him. I can see him.

19:18.631 --> 19:21.969
That also means I'm not crazy.

19:22.069 --> 19:23.635
What the hell are you doing?

19:28.344 --> 19:29.876
Excuse me.

19:30.313 --> 19:32.811
I was talking to your secretary.

19:39.426 --> 19:41.616
What the hell are you doing?

19:41.929 --> 19:46.088
80 percent of all accidents
are caused by poor visibility.

19:48.804 --> 19:53.907
All units in the vicinity go to 227 Maple
to investigate a homicide.

19:54.913 --> 19:57.947
- Stone.
- Looks as though he's struck again.

19:58.316 --> 19:59.575
On my way.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.417
Follow me, Dick!

21:00.498 --> 21:01.859
Sorry.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.652
- What floor?
- Fourth.

21:27.868 --> 21:29.730
- What's going on?
- ID, sir.

21:31.973 --> 21:34.073
Detective Dick Durkin.

21:38.314 --> 21:39.951
What have you got?

21:40.051 --> 21:42.584
What's left of a 28-year-old man.

21:43.655 --> 21:45.756
His heart's been torn out.

21:46.858 --> 21:49.028
What are you doing?
I thought you were suspended.

21:49.128 --> 21:52.526
I was. You got a time of death?

21:54.369 --> 21:57.406
It's a guess, but I'd place
the TOD somewhere around...

21:57.506 --> 21:59.676
- 6:30.
- Yes.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.074
How do you know that?

22:19.570 --> 22:21.602
Is it always like this?

22:24.743 --> 22:26.774
It's always like this.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.559
I hate rats.

22:39.997 --> 22:41.993
Sorry about the suit.

23:00.624 --> 23:01.916
Damn.

23:03.528 --> 23:05.127
What is it?

23:06.064 --> 23:07.629
It's a message for me.

23:08.033 --> 23:11.671
- How do you know it's for you?
- This is my partner's.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.138
What is that?

23:20.149 --> 23:22.715
Looks like an astrological symbol.

23:23.419 --> 23:26.714
It is. A symbol for Scorpio.

23:27.425 --> 23:31.687
Inverted triangle inside a circle,
that's using the occult.

23:32.032 --> 23:35.134
"25, 78." Don't know what that means.

23:36.269 --> 23:39.031
- Has he ever done this before?
- No.

23:39.708 --> 23:42.445
I wonder if he stood
on the bed to paint it.

23:42.545 --> 23:44.818
If he did, he shouldn't
be too hard to find.

23:44.918 --> 23:45.910
Why?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.110
He'd have to be 10 feet tall.

23:51.191 --> 23:54.360
- What do you know about the occult?
- Nothing.

23:54.761 --> 23:56.631
I thought you went to school.

23:56.731 --> 23:59.835
I did, but the occult
wasn't on the curriculum.

23:59.935 --> 24:02.296
What about this Scorpio stuff?

24:02.838 --> 24:04.734
Are you serious?

24:05.208 --> 24:07.811
- You must read your horoscope.
- Why?

24:07.911 --> 24:10.274
Got a present for you, Stone.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.652
Chief asked me to give you this.

24:12.752 --> 24:16.090
It's the cast of the dentition,
from the heart this morning.

24:16.190 --> 24:18.824
Take this to the lab
and have it checked.

24:19.227 --> 24:21.396
Now. You got a problem with that?

24:21.496 --> 24:25.691
Yeah, the same problem I got with you.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

24:26.602 --> 24:29.340
Bring this to the lab right now!
I don't have time for this!

24:29.440 --> 24:33.280
Don't think everybody's not going
to hear about this because they are.

24:33.380 --> 24:37.107
- What were you saying?
- A little tension between you two?

24:37.385 --> 24:38.984
Shut up.

24:44.247 --> 24:46.074
Go on.

25:16.655 --> 25:18.289
Show me your face!

25:24.868 --> 25:26.535
Foster!

25:30.074 --> 25:31.376
Freeze!

25:31.476 --> 25:33.736
He's a police officer! Back off!

25:34.146 --> 25:36.110
Back!

25:36.382 --> 25:37.674
Okay.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.553
What happened?

25:42.290 --> 25:44.482
He's out here somewhere.

25:44.693 --> 25:48.421
- How do you know?
- I'm telling you, he's watching.

26:04.285 --> 26:06.419
Can I ask you a question?

26:09.391 --> 26:10.685
What?

26:11.262 --> 26:14.295
- What happened back there?
- We got close.

26:14.601 --> 26:17.361
- How do you know?
- That's two questions.

26:23.110 --> 26:26.872
How do you know what time
the second victim was killed?

26:31.455 --> 26:33.749
Are you psychic or something?

26:34.425 --> 26:38.464
- Your fucking attitude is driving me nuts.
- Word is, you are nuts.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.765
I shouldn't have said that...

26:39.865 --> 26:43.297
but since we're working together,
it's best if we're honest.

26:44.538 --> 26:47.842
We're not working together
and I'm not nuts.

26:47.942 --> 26:49.508
Okay.

26:50.379 --> 26:54.210
Was it Paulsen that turned you in
for the report that got you suspended?

26:54.518 --> 26:57.017
It's just a rumor that I heard.

26:58.256 --> 26:59.947
Zip up, Dick.

27:06.067 --> 27:08.930
Are there any similarities
in the victims?

27:09.204 --> 27:12.810
You may not like me, but I'm good.
I have an Honors in Serial Homicide.

27:12.910 --> 27:14.543
Terrific.

27:15.646 --> 27:19.317
I spent a year with Behavioral Science
Division studying serial killers...

27:19.417 --> 27:21.054
and another year with Interpol.

27:21.154 --> 27:24.552
I'm not some idiot
straight out of police school.

27:24.725 --> 27:27.416
Did you know Charles Manson
was a Scorpio?

27:33.537 --> 27:36.940
Before yesterday, I thought
we were dealing with a psychotic.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.679
Then, after you told me about the hearts,
I was convinced he was a psychopath.

27:42.780 --> 27:45.746
And seeing what he did,
I'd have to say he's both.

27:46.921 --> 27:49.419
A psychotic
with a psychopathic personality.

27:55.532 --> 27:57.569
There are no similarities
between the victims.

27:57.669 --> 28:00.939
- There has to be.
- This beast doesn't care what it kills.

28:01.039 --> 28:02.675
Why do you call him a beast?

28:02.775 --> 28:05.137
What would you call something...

28:06.580 --> 28:08.874
with teeth like this?

28:35.351 --> 28:37.781
- Give me your keys.
- What for?

28:38.088 --> 28:39.880
Give me your keys.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.592
A present from my girlfriend.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.356
Where are we going?

28:49.271 --> 28:51.301
You're not going anywhere.

28:53.909 --> 28:55.736
That's not fair.

29:34.429 --> 29:35.891
Michelle?

29:38.200 --> 29:39.595
No, King Kong.

29:42.039 --> 29:44.572
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

29:47.045 --> 29:51.205
I come here every time I come to London.

29:55.757 --> 29:57.619
I just called you.

29:58.294 --> 29:59.860
You did?

30:02.199 --> 30:05.036
Your answering machine
wasn't working so I...

30:05.136 --> 30:06.633
Hung up.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.805
- You look very pretty.
- You look like shit.

30:17.418 --> 30:18.711
Thanks.

30:19.922 --> 30:22.989
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

30:24.662 --> 30:26.694
Maybe four days ago.

30:29.235 --> 30:33.201
His killer is still around
and I don't know if I can get him.

30:34.508 --> 30:37.542
Then don't try.
Just give it up and walk away.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.017
I can't.

30:45.823 --> 30:48.287
How about just for the night?

30:56.136 --> 30:58.237
Better watch your coat.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.301
I've got a lot of greasy stuff.

31:16.430 --> 31:19.657
- Is there a light?
- Right in front of you.

31:26.745 --> 31:28.970
No wonder I couldn't find you.

31:29.247 --> 31:31.284
Were you looking for me?

31:31.384 --> 31:33.676
Yes, I was looking for you.

31:33.886 --> 31:36.554
Could we open a window?

31:40.962 --> 31:42.755
Get out of here.

31:44.099 --> 31:46.063
Windows are broken.

31:47.371 --> 31:49.334
I can open that door.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.841
Thanks. That's a little better.

32:00.054 --> 32:02.223
I'm sorry I disappeared.

32:02.323 --> 32:04.559
It wasn't your fault
any more than it was mine.

32:04.659 --> 32:07.124
That's just the way it happened.

32:17.344 --> 32:20.537
When was the last time
you cleaned this place?

32:20.714 --> 32:22.543
I don't remember.

32:24.453 --> 32:26.519
It's good to see you.

32:27.090 --> 32:29.623
I hear that you were suspended.

32:30.194 --> 32:32.022
Word gets around.

32:32.197 --> 32:35.526
No, Paulsen called.
He and Foster were close.

32:37.636 --> 32:39.862
You still on the wagon?

32:41.708 --> 32:43.433
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:45.913 --> 32:48.040
I just brought one of the kids
from Newcastle.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.876
- You've got kids now?
- No, I work with children.

32:50.976 --> 32:54.476
There's a lot of kids
that need psychological help.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.741
That's really nice.

32:59.889 --> 33:02.319
- Yeah.
- Sorry about the pigeons.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.754
I can't kill 'em.

33:08.267 --> 33:10.128
How's Foster's mom?

33:11.637 --> 33:13.031
The same.

33:13.974 --> 33:17.143
- I don't think she'll ever get over it.
- Yes.

33:19.514 --> 33:21.146
How are you?

33:22.151 --> 33:23.841
Me? I'm crazy as ever.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.023
I miss him.

33:33.165 --> 33:34.594
I miss him, too.

33:37.270 --> 33:39.439
I'll make some coffee.

33:40.875 --> 33:42.703
Don't you have any real food?

34:48.065 --> 34:50.027
It's midnight. Tide's coming up.

34:51.768 --> 34:55.268
- Come on.
- Let's go get a beer. There's nothing here.

35:03.918 --> 35:06.417
Foster?

35:19.105 --> 35:20.932
Come on.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.723
Durkin, you're sick.

37:32.013 --> 37:33.511
Freeze!

37:33.716 --> 37:34.974
You want breakfast?

37:36.620 --> 37:37.808
No.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.979
Fine, I'll drive.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.352
Hop in.

37:55.777 --> 37:59.148
Are you telling me you guys
from Oxford don't eat breakfast?

37:59.248 --> 38:01.610
Yeah, right after I run.

38:02.587 --> 38:04.056
- You what?
- Run.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.324
Five miles every morning.

38:06.693 --> 38:10.385
- What's the matter, you don't get laid?
- Yeah, every night.

38:12.233 --> 38:15.871
You get laid every night,
and you run five miles every morning?

38:15.971 --> 38:18.140
Yeah. Except Sundays.

38:18.475 --> 38:23.010
My girlfriend and I stay in bed
and fool around.

38:26.185 --> 38:28.286
That's disgusting.

38:29.589 --> 38:31.121
What is it?

38:32.525 --> 38:34.695
Nothing. I need coffee.

38:55.824 --> 38:57.549
What's this?

38:58.027 --> 39:01.960
Books: paranormal psychology,
astrology, the occult.

39:02.432 --> 39:06.125
- You read them all?
- Last night, after sex.

39:09.543 --> 39:11.142
Do you mind?

39:11.443 --> 39:13.748
You smoke too much,
drink too much coffee...

39:13.848 --> 39:16.417
- ... and eat too much sugar.
- Helps ease the tension.

39:16.517 --> 39:19.915
I can get rid of that.
Massage is one of my hobbies.

39:20.924 --> 39:24.462
That's it. Now, just relax.
Let the tension flow.

39:24.562 --> 39:28.699
Listen, pal,
touching me is not a great idea.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.630
We're cops, okay?

40:10.355 --> 40:12.421
- How's it going?
- Good.

40:13.959 --> 40:16.857
Get me some breakfast, coffee.

40:20.936 --> 40:24.594
Could I have a Lapsang Souchong
and a croissant, please?

40:28.445 --> 40:31.706
You know, I think you have
supernatural powers.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.656
- You read that in one of your books?
- Yeah.

40:38.091 --> 40:42.826
In the Black Masque.
I collect them, it is one of my hobbies.

40:42.926 --> 40:46.998
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Not since I gave up drinking.

40:47.098 --> 40:49.164
You quit drinking? Good for you.

40:50.403 --> 40:53.595
What is it about you
that reminds me of my mom?

40:53.841 --> 40:55.309
Maybe because I'm so charming.

40:55.409 --> 40:59.067
My mom was a lot of things,
she was not charming.

41:03.185 --> 41:05.877
- God, I love this job.
- Interested?

41:27.084 --> 41:29.345
It's really good.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.857
I hear you used to be a good cop.
My croissant?

41:31.957 --> 41:34.250
What else? You got some salt?

41:34.361 --> 41:36.586
Then you went a bit loopy.

41:37.765 --> 41:40.024
That could be why you're psychic.

41:40.502 --> 41:42.271
I just feel things, that's all.

41:42.371 --> 41:44.972
I hate to break the news,
but that's what psychic is.

42:04.065 --> 42:07.202
I think you and this killer
are on the same psychic wavelength.

42:07.302 --> 42:09.631
What sign were you born under?

42:10.675 --> 42:13.177
- I don't remember.
- Come on. When's your birthday?

42:13.277 --> 42:15.814
- November 10.
- You're a Scorpio.

42:15.914 --> 42:19.347
- So what?
- That's the sign he drew on the ceiling.

42:35.907 --> 42:38.441
You ever asked yourself
why he sent you the heart?

42:43.084 --> 42:45.753
Maybe it's because he thinks
you lack compassion.

42:45.853 --> 42:47.248
Are you trying to be funny?

42:57.168 --> 42:58.528
Great!

43:01.174 --> 43:03.308
I've been wondering...

43:05.314 --> 43:08.245
why he only kills during the high tide.

43:08.785 --> 43:11.021
I'll bet it has something
to do with the...

43:11.121 --> 43:16.384
astrological alignment of the stars
in conjunction with the new moon.

43:18.665 --> 43:20.856
Scorpio is a water sign.

43:21.435 --> 43:23.672
The highest tide pulls in the new moon.

43:23.772 --> 43:27.475
That's just off the top of my head.
You probably have a better idea.

43:27.575 --> 43:29.175
No, I don't.

43:36.854 --> 43:39.892
He shows up every month
on the night of the new moon...

43:39.992 --> 43:43.219
he kills before midnight,
in different locations...

43:43.697 --> 43:45.967
then he disappears.
We don't have a motive.

43:46.067 --> 43:48.503
- We don't have a pattern.
- Slow down.

43:48.603 --> 43:52.261
The only thing we know for sure
is that he's not a vegetarian.

43:58.918 --> 44:00.345
Stone?

44:02.722 --> 44:06.621
Okay, dipshit, your turn.
What do you make of all this?

44:12.635 --> 44:15.861
I don't care about your degrees
or secondhand knowledge.

44:16.006 --> 44:19.005
I want to know what you think. You.

44:19.911 --> 44:23.717
Any units in the area, report.
There's an intruder at 16 Roselle Street.

44:23.817 --> 44:25.814
- That's...
- My place.

44:35.131 --> 44:36.593
My shotgun.

44:37.667 --> 44:39.460
Call for backup. Now!

44:51.319 --> 44:52.781
Michelle?

45:25.230 --> 45:26.795
Where is he?

45:29.035 --> 45:31.205
If this is a joke,
I don't think it's funny.

45:31.305 --> 45:34.208
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a shower.

45:34.308 --> 45:35.811
- You're taking a shower?
- Yes.

45:35.911 --> 45:39.149
- I heard screaming.
- The water got colder!

45:39.249 --> 45:42.283
- The door is open.
- I didn't open it.

45:46.559 --> 45:47.987
Lock it!

45:53.802 --> 45:55.972
- What are you doing?
- They're on their way.

45:56.072 --> 45:57.569
She's okay.

46:14.595 --> 46:16.024
Get back here!

46:28.747 --> 46:30.575
Stupid son of a bitch!

47:33.567 --> 47:36.601
I'd better find Durkin.

47:39.140 --> 47:41.572
Stone! For Christ's sake!

47:44.080 --> 47:46.717
- It bit me!
- Don't worry about it.

47:46.817 --> 47:49.077
- What?
- I'll get the medics.

47:49.988 --> 47:51.883
Come on, move back!

48:16.322 --> 48:19.595
Her chest was ripped open.
He must have used a hatchet.

48:19.695 --> 48:22.626
No, he used his hands.

48:40.387 --> 48:42.022
You saw him, didn't you?

49:03.017 --> 49:05.413
The guy's hyperventilating.

49:06.489 --> 49:08.282
Okay, come on.

49:10.027 --> 49:12.398
I'm okay. Need some fresh air.

49:12.498 --> 49:14.029
Give him space.

49:17.337 --> 49:20.029
Just calm down. Breathe in deep.

49:20.307 --> 49:22.168
Easy, fella.

49:37.595 --> 49:40.168
Hey, Harley!

49:47.178 --> 49:48.571
Foster?

49:59.795 --> 50:01.485
Jesus!

50:02.065 --> 50:04.962
Foster? Come on, pal.

50:17.284 --> 50:20.353
- Jesus.
- Stone, are you all right?

50:21.490 --> 50:22.918
Dick.

50:25.095 --> 50:28.399
- What are you doing here?
- No wonder you have panic attacks.

50:28.499 --> 50:32.604
- That's it! That's your psychic connection.
- You're supposed to be dead.

50:32.704 --> 50:37.171
You've never heard of a bulletproof vest?
Man, watch out. Right.

50:38.847 --> 50:41.481
Don't you ask me why I did that.

50:51.030 --> 50:54.723
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

50:56.971 --> 50:59.162
Did you see anything?

50:59.974 --> 51:04.579
No, I saw a flash and then I felt the pain,
but that's all I remember.

51:07.718 --> 51:10.752
Michelle, I'd like a word
with you, please.

51:11.889 --> 51:14.115
Catch up with you later.

51:31.849 --> 51:35.178
I'm sorry, it's my lighter.

51:48.372 --> 51:51.632
- Where's the report from the lab?
- On your desk.

51:52.143 --> 51:55.212
- What did you find out?
- Read the report.

51:55.447 --> 51:57.308
What did you find out?

51:57.984 --> 52:00.675
Traces of Leptospira interrogans.

52:01.888 --> 52:02.825
What?

52:02.925 --> 52:06.493
That's the rat virus
that causes Weil's disease.

52:07.363 --> 52:09.466
- Any fingerprints?
- Just one set.

52:09.566 --> 52:11.001
- Did you bring them in?
- No.

52:11.101 --> 52:13.998
- Why not?
- Because they were Foster's.

52:14.573 --> 52:17.901
Your old partner, my best friend.
Do you remember him?

52:19.779 --> 52:21.315
Get your fucking hands off me.

52:21.415 --> 52:24.819
You want to tell me
why you turned me in for a medical?

52:24.919 --> 52:27.490
- You really want to know?
- Tell me.

52:27.590 --> 52:30.527
Not because you caused
the death of your best friend...

52:30.627 --> 52:34.666
not because you ran away with his wife,
not because you then dumped her...

52:34.766 --> 52:36.870
but because you're past it.

52:36.970 --> 52:39.539
You're a liability.
You're a fucking menace!

52:39.639 --> 52:41.330
Get your hands off him!

52:42.042 --> 52:43.436
Relax.

52:44.546 --> 52:46.543
Get in my office. Now!

52:56.060 --> 52:57.863
You know what I just heard?

52:57.963 --> 53:02.498
You came face to face with the killer
and unloaded a full clip at him.

53:05.940 --> 53:08.041
The word is you missed.

53:08.410 --> 53:11.748
- Do you know me to miss?
- You saying you hit him?

53:11.848 --> 53:16.021
- I didn't miss. That's what I'm saying.
- Then why the fuck isn't he dead?

53:16.121 --> 53:21.056
I unloaded a full clip,
450 Magnum, point blank.

53:21.862 --> 53:24.860
It disappeared. Vanished in front of me.

53:25.365 --> 53:28.296
You are telling me
this guy is superhuman?

53:28.436 --> 53:32.836
I don't know what he is,
sure as hell ain't like you or me.

53:33.309 --> 53:34.378
What is it?

53:34.478 --> 53:36.881
Genetic fingerprints
have come back from the lab.

53:36.981 --> 53:39.081
I think you should see this.

53:42.355 --> 53:43.957
What the hell is this?

53:44.057 --> 53:47.395
Multiple restriction,
polymorphic DNA sequences.

53:47.495 --> 53:48.563
Bullshit.

53:48.663 --> 53:51.890
It has the DNA structure
of all its victims.

53:53.670 --> 53:55.997
It says here it's got rat DNA.

53:57.975 --> 54:00.075
It's got your DNA, too.

54:01.913 --> 54:04.350
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

54:04.450 --> 54:07.120
- Durkin, stick with him.
- Yes, sir.

54:07.220 --> 54:09.754
- And, Durkin...
- Sir?

54:10.092 --> 54:11.782
Watch your ass.

54:36.593 --> 54:40.132
If it makes you feel any better,
those DNA reports can be wrong.

54:40.232 --> 54:41.955
Yeah, right.

54:42.534 --> 54:44.703
He didn't get her heart.

54:51.712 --> 54:53.541
What did you say?

54:53.748 --> 54:56.782
The last victim's heart,
he didn't get it.

54:58.355 --> 55:01.082
That means it's going to come back.

55:05.532 --> 55:07.393
Are you ready to die?

55:07.600 --> 55:08.790
What?

55:09.470 --> 55:11.434
The morgue. Come on!

55:13.943 --> 55:15.144
Get lost!

55:15.244 --> 55:17.174
Excuse me!

55:18.715 --> 55:21.008
Out of my way, you fucks!

55:27.961 --> 55:29.685
He's in there.

55:51.024 --> 55:52.852
I'll wait outside.

55:53.661 --> 55:55.887
Didn't think you'd buy that.

56:18.127 --> 56:19.954
I don't like this.

56:58.714 --> 57:00.940
Don't move or you're dead!

57:02.619 --> 57:06.415
- What are you eating?
- He works here.

57:12.365 --> 57:14.328
- Oxford?
- Yes.

57:15.368 --> 57:16.730
Sorry.

57:17.671 --> 57:19.099
Anytime.

57:32.392 --> 57:33.888
What?

57:37.231 --> 57:38.420
Up there.

57:39.834 --> 57:41.662
I'll be damned.

57:44.300 --> 57:46.366
What's going on here?

57:59.152 --> 58:02.618
- What do you think?
- I think he's gone.

58:02.924 --> 58:04.523
Yeah, right.

58:09.233 --> 58:10.798
You got him!

58:14.572 --> 58:16.364
I know I hit him.

58:48.951 --> 58:51.121
We need bigger guns, Stone.

58:51.221 --> 58:53.117
That's quite a hole.

58:53.223 --> 58:55.560
- Did you get to see him?
- Him?

58:55.660 --> 58:58.364
That wasn't a "him."
That was a fucking "it"!

58:58.464 --> 59:02.658
- We've got to get bigger guns!
- Take a deep breath. Relax.

59:03.170 --> 59:05.099
Okay. Come on.

59:13.117 --> 59:17.188
We need bigger guns, big fucking guns!

59:18.057 --> 59:19.417
Sorry.

59:20.393 --> 59:23.898
We're getting big guns, right?
That's where we're going, to get big guns.

59:23.998 --> 59:27.794
Stone, we need some big fucking guns!

59:29.973 --> 59:33.234
- Another one.
- Did you see his eyes?

59:33.511 --> 59:36.408
All I saw was this...

59:36.681 --> 59:38.042
Drink.

59:40.486 --> 59:42.950
...huge fucking thing.

59:45.258 --> 59:46.984
How are you feeling?

59:47.195 --> 59:49.830
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.601
How?

59:52.701 --> 59:55.201
- I feel...
- On edge?

59:55.372 --> 59:57.007
- Yeah.
- Good.

59:57.875 --> 59:59.736
Have one of these.

01:00:05.453 --> 01:00:08.952
- You really get laid every night?
- Yeah!

01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:13.157
Now what?

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:19.063
We're going to get bigger guns.

01:00:21.841 --> 01:00:23.475
Hallelujah.

01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:31.775
A-3, high-powered semiautomatic.

01:00:32.355 --> 01:00:34.591
- Something bigger.
- What?

01:00:34.691 --> 01:00:36.293
Does the Chief know you're down here?

01:00:36.393 --> 01:00:39.797
We need big guns. Big fucking guns.

01:00:39.897 --> 01:00:41.801
What the hell's he on?

01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:44.171
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:48.074
I want a grenade launcher.
High-capacity 90mm, automatic.

01:00:48.174 --> 01:00:50.104
- Right.
- SA80.

01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:52.747
These are too fucking small!

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:01.752
No. That's an assault shotgun,
fully automatic.

01:01:02.261 --> 01:01:05.454
Listen, that fires 650 rounds a minute.

01:01:06.834 --> 01:01:08.636
What do you need two for?

01:01:08.736 --> 01:01:11.770
What the fuck is this thing
you're after, a German tank?

01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:15.279
No, that's a Megatron flash grenade.

01:01:15.379 --> 01:01:17.979
You could clear the jungle
with one of these things.

01:01:21.653 --> 01:01:23.685
Bingo! Let's go!

01:01:26.692 --> 01:01:30.125
Right. I was wondering
if one of you guys would sign...

01:01:31.232 --> 01:01:34.670
This thing, it's like the sum total
of every serial killer I've studied.

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:38.140
A single organism made up
of multiple DNA structures.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.580
It's as if someone took every serial killer,
and rolled it into one incredible being.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.684
What are you doing with those things?
Who authorized this?

01:01:45.784 --> 01:01:46.854
Shit!

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:49.858
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- What?

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:53.362
"25, 78." 25th year, 78th cycle.

01:01:53.462 --> 01:01:56.566
The Chinese calendar.
2008, now, this year.

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:59.503
- What are you on about?
- 2008 is the year.

01:01:59.603 --> 01:02:02.040
- Of the rat!
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.210
The inverted triangle
is not only a symbol of evil...

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.845
it also represents water.

01:02:06.945 --> 01:02:09.482
What have you done to him?
He's sounding like you.

01:02:09.582 --> 01:02:12.654
- What about the circle?
- Circle is the sign of magic and power.

01:02:12.754 --> 01:02:15.458
Everything inside the circle
is protected from the outside.

01:02:15.558 --> 01:02:17.058
Hello!

01:02:17.158 --> 01:02:19.862
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

01:02:19.962 --> 01:02:23.067
Scorpio is the sign most susceptible
to the powers of darkness.

01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:25.036
To Scorpio, the idea of being joined...

01:02:25.136 --> 01:02:27.473
with a supernatural being
is very important.

01:02:27.573 --> 01:02:30.277
And the most powerful
supernatural being... Satan!

01:02:30.377 --> 01:02:31.945
What are you on about?

01:02:32.045 --> 01:02:35.049
When chaos reigns,
then will the Fallen Angel prevail.

01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:38.053
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- Look around!

01:02:38.153 --> 01:02:41.759
- The world's in chaos!
- I don't believe this shit!

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:44.462
He's eating human hearts,
for Christ's sake.

01:02:44.562 --> 01:02:46.966
- How do you know?
- We had lunch with him.

01:02:47.066 --> 01:02:49.636
Cannibals ate hearts
to gain possession of souls.

01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:52.072
It believes that if it eats
its victims' hearts...

01:02:52.172 --> 01:02:55.476
it not only gains their power
and their DNA...

01:02:55.576 --> 01:02:57.938
it also gains their souls.

01:02:58.213 --> 01:03:01.751
Are you telling me there's something
running loose in this city...

01:03:01.851 --> 01:03:06.956
ripping out and eating people's hearts
so he can take their souls back to hell?

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.185
Looks that way.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.196
Hallelujah.

01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:16.293
You're both fucking nuts.

01:03:17.672 --> 01:03:19.174
What am I supposed to do?

01:03:19.274 --> 01:03:23.179
Put out an APB on some fucking guy
who looks like the devil?

01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:26.417
Answers to the name of Lucifer?
Yeah, and you!

01:03:26.517 --> 01:03:29.456
I suppose he's got two fucking horns
sticking out of his head!

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:33.055
Yeah, and a fucking tail!
Fucking get out of the way!

01:03:33.794 --> 01:03:36.964
Jesus Christ! The pair of pricks!

01:03:46.878 --> 01:03:48.272
Coffee?

01:03:51.616 --> 01:03:53.683
This place is amazing.

01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:58.588
Great bike.

01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:01.752
Do you want some...

01:04:03.899 --> 01:04:05.500
coffee?

01:04:05.702 --> 01:04:06.960
Yes, please.

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:13.036
What have we got?

01:04:13.445 --> 01:04:15.416
We don't have anything.

01:04:15.516 --> 01:04:18.776
We're not chasing it, it's chasing us.

01:04:20.054 --> 01:04:21.984
- Milk?
- Just a drop.

01:04:32.572 --> 01:04:33.932
Don't.

01:04:41.081 --> 01:04:45.879
This thing has really started
to piss me off.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.931
I think you need a plumber.

01:05:03.444 --> 01:05:05.272
I'll cover you.

01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:15.925
Michelle, what are you doing here?

01:05:19.866 --> 01:05:22.399
In the fridge, I touched it.

01:05:22.637 --> 01:05:24.707
It's all right. It's okay.

01:05:24.807 --> 01:05:27.272
The door was open, so I came in.

01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:30.840
So you're back now.
Everything's going to be fine.

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.375
What happened?

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.419
Foster's mother killed herself.

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:42.858
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.870
Stay there.

01:05:56.447 --> 01:05:59.284
The bite on her shoulder
means he's promised to it.

01:05:59.384 --> 01:06:01.454
- He's got her DNA, too?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.554 --> 01:06:02.948
Harley.

01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:07.890
"Harley." I'm working
with a guy called Harley.

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.599
You think that's funny?

01:06:16.207 --> 01:06:18.842
What's so great about Dick Durkin?

01:06:21.848 --> 01:06:23.949
Go sit in the car.

01:06:24.152 --> 01:06:26.148
Call me on the radio.

01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:44.673
Which hand did you use? This one?

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:52.142
He's after me now, isn't he?

01:06:53.522 --> 01:06:54.779
No.

01:06:57.425 --> 01:06:59.526
He's getting desperate.

01:07:00.496 --> 01:07:02.221
So am I.

01:07:05.469 --> 01:07:06.762
Come.

01:07:25.862 --> 01:07:27.190
Stone.

01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:33.706
Stone here. Come in.

01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:36.009
There's something moving
at the end of the street.

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:39.514
- What is it?
- I'm just going to investigate.

01:07:39.614 --> 01:07:42.718
I don't know. I'd better take a look.

01:07:43.853 --> 01:07:45.282
One sec.

01:07:57.404 --> 01:07:59.095
Oxford, come in.

01:08:06.984 --> 01:08:08.915
Durkin, come in.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:12.723
What's wrong?

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:16.223
I don't know. Durkin's jeep's gone.

01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:19.134
I'd better go take a look.

01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:24.140
You stay here on the couch.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.705
Something goes wrong, take this.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.549
All right?

01:09:32.261 --> 01:09:34.294
Dick, come in.

01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:45.209
Having fun?

01:10:18.557 --> 01:10:19.747
Harley!

01:10:26.133 --> 01:10:27.597
Durkin!

01:10:37.549 --> 01:10:39.513
Stone!

01:10:39.884 --> 01:10:41.518
Yeah, hang on.

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:43.484
Got you.

01:10:43.924 --> 01:10:46.252
Get me out of here!

01:10:54.438 --> 01:10:58.664
What happened?
I was looking for you. You okay?

01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:02.146
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

01:11:02.247 --> 01:11:04.108
Didn't even see it.

01:11:05.452 --> 01:11:07.315
What's it done to me?

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:13.320
I'm going to kill that fucker. I'm going
to find it, and I'm going to kill it.

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:38.927
Rat bastard!

01:12:03.428 --> 01:12:04.858
Michelle?

01:12:18.315 --> 01:12:20.143
What are you doing?

01:12:20.484 --> 01:12:23.279
There was a rat, so I shot it.

01:12:24.056 --> 01:12:26.657
You shot my kitchen, that's what.

01:12:27.126 --> 01:12:28.954
I missed the rat.

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.556
What? This one?

01:12:33.468 --> 01:12:34.760
Cool.

01:12:37.606 --> 01:12:39.296
I'm bleeding.

01:12:44.015 --> 01:12:47.619
Come on, pal, wake up. Get back to work.

01:12:47.719 --> 01:12:50.185
What? What are you doing?

01:12:52.761 --> 01:12:54.622
What's it done to me?

01:12:55.897 --> 01:12:58.498
See, this is his symbol.

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.702
We've been looking for a meaning.

01:13:01.972 --> 01:13:04.573
What if the symbol is just a map?

01:13:05.343 --> 01:13:06.646
A map?

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:08.641
Give me that mirror.

01:13:09.807 --> 01:13:11.869
Give me the mirror.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.683
Fuck!

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:21.559
There's a circle, a triangle,
a Scorpio sign.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.026
- The sting in the tail.
- Let me see.

01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:29.063
The tail points into the River Thames.

01:13:29.842 --> 01:13:31.067
Doesn't make sense.

01:13:34.214 --> 01:13:36.746
It's pointing to Cannon Street.

01:13:37.519 --> 01:13:39.589
That's where Foster was killed.

01:13:39.689 --> 01:13:42.357
It's taking you back.
It's completing the circle.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.115
If he's there, Michelle's there.

01:13:47.484 --> 01:13:48.652
Geometrically speaking...

01:13:48.752 --> 01:13:51.791
once he kills you,
he's completed his pattern.

01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:53.992
Durkin, come on.

01:13:54.092 --> 01:13:57.964
Cannon Street Station hasn't been used
in years. It got submerged.

01:13:58.064 --> 01:14:01.792
I know a guy who can get us in
who lives here.

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.031
What, is he crazy?

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:09.041
You'll like him,
he catches rats for a living.

01:14:10.214 --> 01:14:11.938
He missed some.

01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:15.010
Open up! Police!

01:14:18.525 --> 01:14:20.521
Where's the big guy?

01:14:23.932 --> 01:14:26.623
Are there any lights in this place?

01:14:27.736 --> 01:14:31.032
- I think we're below the water table.
- I know.

01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:33.705
I just thought I'd mention it.

01:14:36.549 --> 01:14:38.478
Where's your boss?

01:14:48.498 --> 01:14:50.601
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

01:14:50.701 --> 01:14:52.437
You know it's 4:00 in the morning?

01:14:52.537 --> 01:14:56.541
- We want to get to Cannon Street, fast.
- You can't go there. It's closed off.

01:14:56.641 --> 01:15:00.506
- Can you get us down there?
- You're really serious about this.

01:15:02.015 --> 01:15:05.048
- Got any cash?
- No, just credit cards.

01:15:05.386 --> 01:15:07.611
Give me your watch.

01:15:08.657 --> 01:15:11.019
This serious enough for you?

01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:16.060
The exits and entrances
are all blocked off.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.237
We sent a couple of guys
down there a few years ago.

01:15:20.339 --> 01:15:23.942
- What happened to them?
- They didn't come back, I guess.

01:15:25.879 --> 01:15:27.742
Can you get us in?

01:15:28.017 --> 01:15:31.020
- You don't want to go there.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.017
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:36.758
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:37.262 --> 01:15:40.125
- Boy, are you pushy.
- Give me the watch.

01:15:40.433 --> 01:15:43.796
You're not going to need time
where you're going.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.490
Get it off me.

01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:09.036
I hate rats.

01:16:09.136 --> 01:16:11.533
They love you.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.349
Strange boy.

01:16:20.852 --> 01:16:22.987
He gets laid every night.

01:16:26.728 --> 01:16:28.530
This is my little door.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.099
Nobody knows about this, Stone,
except you.

01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:34.928
So don't tell anybody.
This is to my den.

01:16:35.138 --> 01:16:36.703
This is the loo.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.805
This is it.

01:16:50.424 --> 01:16:52.924
Where does he find these people?

01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:59.027
Hurry up, Durkin.

01:17:01.139 --> 01:17:04.504
We're definitely below
the water table now.

01:17:04.777 --> 01:17:06.570
He's down here.

01:17:08.949 --> 01:17:11.277
This is as far as I go, guys.

01:17:11.887 --> 01:17:14.352
Do we need any of those keys?

01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:20.629
Get the keys.

01:17:21.065 --> 01:17:23.826
- Thanks.
- I wish you well, guys.

01:17:30.378 --> 01:17:31.737
Come on.

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:40.490
If I were a religious human being,
and not the reasoning person I think I am...

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:44.028
I wouldn't say this thing
thinks it's Satan, I'd say it is Satan.

01:17:44.128 --> 01:17:46.797
Satan is in deep shit.

01:18:20.743 --> 01:18:23.469
- Do you want a Rah Rah?
- No, come on.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.383
I hate this place!

01:18:32.193 --> 01:18:34.796
"Master of light,
protect us from this evil plight.

01:18:34.896 --> 01:18:39.168
"For lowly lives, I take my fight,
Black Masque power.

01:18:39.268 --> 01:18:40.800
"The rights of might..."

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:58.626
Don't do that again. It's not funny.

01:19:08.807 --> 01:19:11.671
It's out here somewhere. I can smell it.

01:19:24.962 --> 01:19:26.629
Is it close?

01:19:27.232 --> 01:19:28.898
It's behind us.

01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:33.061
Elevator.

01:19:53.966 --> 01:19:56.226
We can't kill it.

01:19:57.838 --> 01:19:59.370
I'm here.

01:20:01.043 --> 01:20:03.914
My chest, it's burning.

01:20:04.014 --> 01:20:06.272
Listen.

01:20:09.021 --> 01:20:10.983
Hear the heartbeat?

01:20:13.724 --> 01:20:16.416
It's not yours. You understand?

01:20:20.201 --> 01:20:23.268
Good, so let's go get it.

01:20:24.004 --> 01:20:25.104
Okay.

01:20:43.999 --> 01:20:47.328
Jesus Christ! Harley!

01:20:48.371 --> 01:20:51.701
A circle of light.
It's a circle of light!

01:20:52.043 --> 01:20:53.541
Get me...

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.812
Don't break it! Don't break the surface!

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.221
I'm sorry.

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.097
Okay. Swing.

01:21:15.073 --> 01:21:17.505
- Swing?
- Yeah, swing your legs up.

01:21:18.946 --> 01:21:20.636
Get your legs on the roof.

01:21:31.061 --> 01:21:32.354
Come on.

01:21:37.904 --> 01:21:39.298
Harder!

01:21:39.439 --> 01:21:40.628
Yes!

01:21:56.513 --> 01:21:57.736
Run!

01:22:51.317 --> 01:22:52.711
Foster?

01:23:33.974 --> 01:23:35.664
Get out of there!

01:23:35.843 --> 01:23:37.408
Nice timing!

01:23:44.455 --> 01:23:46.390
- Five seconds.
- Okay.

01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:50.025
Four, three, two...

01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:07.439
Watch this!

01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:14.856
- We haven't been introduced. Dick Durkin.
- What?

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.792
I'm gonna fry the fucker.

01:24:22.471 --> 01:24:24.071
Shut it off.

01:24:24.841 --> 01:24:27.032
Okay, need a screwdriver.

01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:29.071
Move!

01:24:35.754 --> 01:24:37.320
Gimme some slack.

01:24:43.398 --> 01:24:44.725
Say when.

01:24:49.641 --> 01:24:51.035
Relax, pal.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:57.345
Get out of the water now!

01:24:58.051 --> 01:24:59.954
- When!
- Are you sure?

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:02.519
- What?
- He said, "When."

01:25:08.532 --> 01:25:09.721
Off!

01:25:12.203 --> 01:25:14.235
Please, Durkin!

01:26:31.808 --> 01:26:33.475
Sweet dreams.

01:26:43.523 --> 01:26:45.089
Is it dead?

01:26:46.561 --> 01:26:47.462
Durkin?

01:26:47.562 --> 01:26:51.000
That's a difficult question to answer
with a simple "yes" or "no."

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.098
Philosophy of death is one
of my hobbies. Existentially...

01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:56.340
- Durkin!
- Tell me later.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.506
I'll tell you later.

01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:25.562
Once again, the Black Masque power
prevails over evil.

01:27:25.662 --> 01:27:29.701
Yes, Detective Dick Durkin
and his psychic sidekick Harley Stone...

01:27:29.801 --> 01:27:31.202
can relax for a moment...

01:27:31.302 --> 01:27:35.511
before they are called forth once more
to do battle with the forces of darkness.

01:27:35.611 --> 01:27:37.613
Durkin?

01:27:37.713 --> 01:27:39.739
Shut up!
