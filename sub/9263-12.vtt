It's a good cause.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.582
So we are all
gonna show our asses up there

09:42.624 --> 09:45.543
with smiles
on our faces.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.212
Now let's go
have some fun.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.094
Oh, really?
That game...

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
Hang on just a second.
Matt Saracen.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.430
Hey, Mr. Garrity.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.556
How you doin', son?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.849
I'm doing all right.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.226
What can I do
for you?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.769
Well, if you're busy,
I don't want to‐‐

10:02.769 --> 10:03.770
Wait a minute.
That's all right.

10:03.812 --> 10:04.938
Roger, Roger.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.106
Take care of that
for me.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.190
I'll be right back.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.525
Are you sure?
Thank you, sir.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.609
I really didn't want
to interrupt you...

10:09.651 --> 10:11.444
Oh no, no, nonsense, son.
Okay.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.613
Those are just people.
You're my quarterback.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.697
[chuckling]
Okay.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.200
My dad's decided
to stay here in Dillon

10:17.242 --> 10:19.744
and not go back
to Iraq.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.121
So that I‐‐I can stay here,

10:21.162 --> 10:23.790
and I don't have to move
to Oklahoma with my aunt.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.459
Well, that's damn good.
[chuckles]

10:26.501 --> 10:27.544
We'd hate to lose you.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
[laughing]
Thanks.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.547
Well, anyway, since‐‐
Since he's not gonna be

10:30.588 --> 10:31.798
working in Iraq,

10:31.840 --> 10:33.216
he needs to be
working here.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.552
And‐‐and there's not

10:35.593 --> 10:36.928
a lot of work here.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.140
So I was just curious

10:40.140 --> 10:41.766
if maybe you...

10:41.808 --> 10:43.810
If you know
of anything.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.562
That‐‐or‐‐

10:45.603 --> 10:46.771
Have any suggestions,
maybe.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.315
Well, Matt...

10:49.315 --> 10:50.817
I'll tell you
what you do.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.069
If you will send your dad
over to me,

10:53.111 --> 10:55.155
I can put him to work
immediately.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.239
You know, I probably‐‐

10:56.281 --> 10:57.448
I could use
a new salesman.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
Our sales are going
through the roof right now.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.827
You send your daddy

11:00.827 --> 11:02.745
over to me,
and I'll take care of him.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.205
How's that sound?
Are you‐‐

11:04.205 --> 11:06.374
Th‐‐thank you so much,
Mr. Garrity.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.208
Oh, you're welcome, son.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.502
Come back and see me.
I will, I will.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.962
Yeah.
Hey, you like to hunt?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.630
All right.
Oh hey, listen.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.175
I was just gonna let you know,
your bill's up to about $294.04.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.303
So you can bring a check in
sometime, that'd be great.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.262
[bell dings]
Thanks.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.014
All right.
Bye.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.561
Hey, Mitch.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.190
Can I talk to you
a minute?

11:37.572 --> 11:39.657
Eric, man,
I am so sorry.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.201
I don't know who it was
behind this.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.078
I know it's not you.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.750
I‐I just didn't know
what else to do, man.
I understand.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.960
You know, I‐‐
Hey, listen,
when I got served the papers,

11:51.002 --> 11:53.004
I said, "I know this isn't
coming from Mitch and Joanne.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.130
I know it's not."

11:54.172 --> 11:56.174
Expenses are astronomical,
Coach.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.217
Look, I understand.
Eric‐‐

11:57.258 --> 12:00.678
You probably realize, too,
it's not a great idea

12:00.720 --> 12:01.721
to get yourself involved
in a lawsuit

12:01.763 --> 12:04.557
that's gonna cause you
that much additional pain.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.809
And you know this is
gonna get you nowhere.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.732
I'm not so sure
that's the case.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.235
Well, hell, Mitch,
what are you gonna do?

12:15.276 --> 12:17.153
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna sue the school?

12:17.195 --> 12:19.656
What are you gonna prove?
That the school was negligent?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.658
And how the hell
are you gonna do that?

12:21.699 --> 12:22.742
I was there.
You were there.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.744
Everybody was there.
I can't talk to you
about this.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.828
Mitch, it was
a horrible accident,

12:25.870 --> 12:27.288
but it was nobody's fault.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.290
It was nobody's fault.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.669
I cannot talk to you
about this.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.924
You think this is tough
for you?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.260
You wanna try
losing your child's legs

12:40.260 --> 12:42.262
and losing
your child's future

12:42.262 --> 12:45.098
and every penny
that you ever saved.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.183
Try that on
for size.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.184
And then after that,
try‐‐try finding

12:48.226 --> 12:50.395
where in the hell you're gonna
come up with money

12:50.436 --> 12:52.605
to put up
the ramps and doorways

12:52.647 --> 12:55.024
all over your house,
and pay for the unending

12:55.066 --> 12:57.026
equipment
and physical therapy.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.445
Hell, I don't want
to sue anyone.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.656
It's killing me
to do this.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.160
But since
I'm already dead...

13:09.497 --> 13:10.832
It doesn't matter anyway,

13:10.832 --> 13:12.709
now does it?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.798
Just get the hell
out of here, Coach.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.053
Get out of here.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.653
I don't know anything
about selling cars.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.904
Hello, Matt!
Hey, Mr. Garrity.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.697
How are you, son?

13:42.739 --> 13:45.074
This is my dad,
Hen‐‐Henry Saracen.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.826
Henry, very nice
to meet you, sir.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.827
Very nice to meet you.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.162
Welcome to Garrity Motors.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.788
Thank you.
We are very proud

13:50.830 --> 13:51.748
to have our very own

13:51.789 --> 13:52.707
quarterback's dad
on our team.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.292
I can tell you that
right now.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.169
Well, I appreciate that.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.170
You bet.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.171
Just step back here

13:58.212 --> 13:59.422
and we'll set you all up.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.757
Easy as pie.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.008
Matt, take a look
at some cars.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.176
Test‐drive one
if you want to.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.178
Yeah, okay.
This way, Henry.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.096
I‐‐let me tell you,
this is really, really simple.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.182
And we got
a friendly, friendly place.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.933
Lot of people I think
you'll enjoy working...

14:12.351 --> 14:14.687
Hey, Waverly.

14:14.729 --> 14:15.938
How's the tuba looking?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.774
Bright and shiny
like your forehead.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.192
And it's a trumpet.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.028
How's the endless speculation
of who's gonna win

14:22.070 --> 14:24.197
that game you guys
were talking about going?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.823
Yeah, well, it's not like
my whole life

14:25.865 --> 14:26.866
don't hang in the balance.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.284
Is that why
you walked out on me

14:28.326 --> 14:29.786
at the diner yesterday?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.370
I didn't walk out on you.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.081
You weren't talking to me,
anyway.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.499
I was sitting
right next to you.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.375
That is so not
the same thing.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.877
All right, look.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.046
Look, I know
you been gone a while.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.340
But there's a few rules about
what's right and what's wrong

14:42.381 --> 14:43.382
that you need to know.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.218
Number one,

14:45.218 --> 14:46.886
don't nobody walk out
on Smash.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.346
Oh, good.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.056
The return
of the third person.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.182
[laughs]
You know,

14:51.224 --> 14:52.892
as fascinating as it is
to sit there

14:52.934 --> 14:54.977
and listen to everyone talk
about how great you are,

14:55.019 --> 14:57.230
the Waverly
has better things to do.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.857
What's wrong with you, girl?
You know you like me.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.317
I do like you.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.235
I just...

15:02.235 --> 15:03.903
I don't think we have
anything in common.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.029
Yeah, we do.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.490
Look, you tell me what you want
to have in common,

15:07.532 --> 15:08.866
and I'll get it in common.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.243
Come on,
work with me, girl.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.911
I'm trying here.
All right.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.372
Um...is there anything
about you

15:14.413 --> 15:16.541
that isn't football
24/7?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.292
Hell, yeah.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.922
Uh...

15:22.922 --> 15:25.049
Anything else
that you talk about?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.844
Do you have
any other friends that...

15:27.885 --> 15:30.221
Matt Saracen
and Julie Taylor.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.597
We chill all the time.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.349
Talk about
a whole mess of stuff

15:33.391 --> 15:34.350
besides football.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.102
I mean...

15:36.144 --> 15:38.855
Immigration, Iraq...

15:38.896 --> 15:39.897
books, music.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.608
Stem cell research.
Global warming. You name it.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.235
In fact,
I'm going to the rodeo

15:44.277 --> 15:45.236
with them on Friday.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.863
You should come along.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.197
See what I mean.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.075
All right.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.287
We'll give the Waverlash
one last try.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.913
The Waverlash?
Mm‐hmm.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.331
That's what you called it?

15:57.331 --> 16:00.293
Oh, that Smash mouth
contagious, girl.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.544
Matt, sweetie?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.254
Don't forget
about my tea.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.964
I know, I won't, Gran‐‐
The water's almost ready there.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.133
You know, I hate for you
to wait on me,

16:07.175 --> 16:09.177
but I promised y'all I wouldn't
mess with that stove.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.390
Oh, shoot.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.392
[kettle whistling]
Um, I'm so sorry.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.393
I'm so sorry.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.978
I've been sitting
at the library

16:18.978 --> 16:20.313
for an hour.
And that's my fault.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.481
And I apologize.
It's just that my‐‐

16:22.481 --> 16:23.482
My grandma called,
and she thought

16:23.524 --> 16:25.318
that there was this really
big mouse in the house,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.320
so I came home,
and then this whole place

16:27.361 --> 16:28.321
was sort of a mess.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.156
So I started
cleaning it up.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.408
And then I remembered
that I had to get dinner ready

16:32.450 --> 16:33.451
before my dad gets home,
Matty, I sure could
use that tea.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.328
and I gotta make tea
for my grandma.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.038
It's on its way, Grandma.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.498
Um, so I gotta be‐‐
Okay, how about
you make dinner

16:39.540 --> 16:41.959
and I'll make your grandma
some tea?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.003
Yeah?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.588
Yeah.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.341
Well, thanks.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.092
Would now be a bad time
to tell you

16:50.134 --> 16:51.510
that I told Smash
that we'd double‐date

16:51.510 --> 16:53.179
with him and Waverly
and we'd pretend

16:53.179 --> 16:55.264
that we do that a lot,
and we talk about

16:55.306 --> 16:57.516
all sorts of neat stuff
besides football?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.314
I heard you!
The last time you went out
with this loser,

17:03.356 --> 17:04.357
you were gone
for three days.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.274
I won't have that again‐‐

17:05.316 --> 17:07.026
All right, all right,
all right!
No!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.069
I said no.
You heard me.
No?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.195
What the hell
is the matter with you?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.197
Are you telling me
when I can and can't

17:11.197 --> 17:12.031
leave this house?

17:12.073 --> 17:12.949
It has nothing to do‐‐
Are you high?

17:12.990 --> 17:13.783
Bob, it has nothing to do
with that‐‐

17:13.824 --> 17:15.868
(Bob)
You know why
people leave you?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.662
Because you
drive people crazy!

17:17.703 --> 17:19.330
Put a bullet in my head.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.414
[Angela shouting]
Get out of my way!

17:20.456 --> 17:21.749
[both yelling]

17:21.749 --> 17:23.376
Get out of my way!

17:23.417 --> 17:24.418
Don't you dare touch her.
Tyra!

17:24.460 --> 17:26.337
Get the hell away from her!
Get the hell out!

17:26.379 --> 17:28.381
Don't you ever
touch my mother again.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.049
I will kill you!
[Angela shrieking]

17:30.091 --> 17:32.385
I'll kill you!
Get the hell out!

17:32.385 --> 17:33.386
You understand?

17:33.427 --> 17:34.637
Do you understand me?

17:34.679 --> 17:36.389
Get out, get out.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.058
Get out, get out.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.393
[screaming]
Do it!

17:40.434 --> 17:42.144
Do it!
Get out of here!

17:42.186 --> 17:44.021
Do it.
Get out, get out.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.356
Do it.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.026
[fire poker
drops to floor]

17:49.068 --> 17:50.111
(Angela)
Oh, my God.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.995
Hey, babe.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.499
I love you guys.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.085
And you guys

18:06.127 --> 18:08.045
are the best parents
in the world.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.383
Good night.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.265
No, honey.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.768
Something terrible
must've happened.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.437
Julie?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.193
There's no adult
looking out for him.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.445
I mean, it's crazy.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.614
He's just by himself,
doing the cooking,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.532
and the cleaning,
the shopping.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.367
He takes care
of his grandma.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.410
His dad's been home
for two weeks,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.163
and there's still a table
full of insurance forms

18:42.204 --> 18:43.414
for his grandma.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.542
And he has school,
and work, and football.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.379
I just...

18:50.421 --> 18:52.798
I feel like
it's just gonna crush him.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.301
Nothing's going to crush
Matt Saracen.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.595
He's like a little stinkbug.
You can't crush him.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.388
He's tough.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.264
He'll be fine.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.141
(Tami)
Well...I do think

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
it is an awful lot
for one 16‐year‐old

19:04.143 --> 19:05.394
to have to handle.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.104
I might be able
to do something.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.147
I don't know.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.398
Have him come see me
at school.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.652
Okay.
Thanks, Mom.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.612
Good night.
Good night.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.322
You're the best.
Good.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.657
(Taylor)
What do you mean,
she's the best?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.824
What about me?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.493
Hey!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.161
[soft knock]

19:26.499 --> 19:28.501
Aren't you gonna get up?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.465
[crying]
I don't think
he's coming back.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.342
God, Mom,
he's just a stupid guy.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.178
It's not like Jesus Christ
just left you.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.515
[sobbing]

19:42.556 --> 19:47.186
I'm just not used
to being alone.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.523
But you're not alone.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.043
You got me.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.383
Nice, Henry.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.009
Bagged 'em.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.056
Oh...

20:24.098 --> 20:26.016
God.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.351
[exhales]

20:30.730 --> 20:32.356
Where'd they go?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.233
I thought they were ready
to take delivery

20:34.233 --> 20:35.401
when I handed them to you.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.569
Well, it turned out
it wasn't

20:36.569 --> 20:38.237
a good time for them,
financially.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
Henry...

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
It's never a bad time
with 5.9% financing.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.244
Never a bad time.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.746
All right.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.080
All right.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.290
I got an idea.
Follow me.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.253
I tell you what I'd like
for you to do,

20:54.253 --> 20:57.089
I'd like for you
to wear this.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.758
And it'll just
help to remind people

20:58.758 --> 21:03.596
that you served this country
for 20 years.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.223
I don't know if I would
think that was right,

21:06.265 --> 21:08.267
using that to sell cars.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.728
Well, Henry...

21:10.770 --> 21:15.608
um, salesmen...

21:15.649 --> 21:17.568
they sell themselves.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.070
I mean you are
what you are.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.739
And that's something
to be proud of.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.448
And I'll just tell you
right now,

21:22.448 --> 21:24.283
I have
the greatest respect...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.577
for our men
in the military.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.497
You guys are what
makes this country great.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.792
And God bless you.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
All right.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.094
Yes, sir.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.431
I think that'll help.
Looks good.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.614
Someone sleeping over?

22:03.656 --> 22:04.657
There's sheets on the couch.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.785
No, that's my dad.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.162
Him and mom are just
fighting a lot now.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.705
They're just like
pissed at each other

22:11.705 --> 22:14.875
even when nothing's
going on.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.168
I think it's just all...

22:16.210 --> 22:18.504
All this, you know?

22:18.504 --> 22:19.505
Jason, do you think
this lawsuit

22:19.547 --> 22:22.800
is the best idea?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.176
You been
talkin' to Buddy?

22:24.218 --> 22:25.678
No.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.180
I'm just asking you
as someone who loves you.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.849
And is on your side.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.185
I can't come up with
anything else.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.687
I mean, everything
costs so damn much.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.856
I mean, there's just...

22:36.856 --> 22:39.692
But everyone would have
looked out for your family.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.694
The town cripple?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.654
How long do you think
that charity

22:43.696 --> 22:45.698
would have lasted, huh?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.366
It's killing me to have to
do this to coach.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.659
And it's killing me
to have to do this

22:48.701 --> 22:50.202
to the team.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.704
But maybe they're all right.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.874
The lawyers, my parents,
maybe they're right.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.876
Maybe someone teaches me
how to tackle somebody,

22:56.917 --> 23:00.546
I'm not in a chair.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.715
We're not in this mess.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.554
If you think this is
for the best,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.890
then I'm with you.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.229
What is it with you
that you wanna

23:17.229 --> 23:18.689
screw your life up for me?

23:18.731 --> 23:21.567
Love makes us
kind of stupid.

23:23.277 --> 23:26.655
Well, thank God for that.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.957
Hey, Dad!

23:36.957 --> 23:39.919
How was the first day
at work?

23:39.919 --> 23:40.920
It was great.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.588
Yeah?
Sell a bunch of cars?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.424
Actually, no.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.427
What are you up to?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.763
Um, you know, history.

23:50.804 --> 23:55.726
All right, I'm gonna
wash up for dinner.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.571
Hey.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.614
Hey.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.953
So what are you doing
out here?

24:13.953 --> 24:18.499
Honestly, I was just kinda
wishing that Arnett Mead

24:18.540 --> 24:20.793
loses to Buckley
and then we get to go

24:20.834 --> 24:21.669
to the playoffs.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.754
And then I don't have to spend
every day

24:23.796 --> 24:24.838
of the rest of my life

24:24.880 --> 24:27.925
wondering what if as
I'm punching at the feed store.

24:27.967 --> 24:33.639
The feed store?

24:33.639 --> 24:36.308
Yeah, okay.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.643
What is all that?

24:37.643 --> 24:40.479
This is some kind
of frozen casserole.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.481
My mom made it.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.651
Just thought
it would help out.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.652
Am I really
that pathetic?

24:46.652 --> 24:49.321
No, you're not pathetic.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.824
You just...
You just do so much

24:51.824 --> 24:55.494
that I just thought
you could use some help out.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.339
I don't know
what I was expecting

25:07.339 --> 25:09.466
to be different
with my dad living here.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.848
Maybe he just needs some time
to settle in.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.850
It seems like
the more he settles in,

25:17.850 --> 25:24.648
the more uncomfortable
he gets.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.566
I don't know.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.693
I guess I wanted him
to want to be here,

25:27.735 --> 25:30.529
not just to be here.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.033
It makes sense, though.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.827
He's been in the Army
for 20 years.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.371
That's what he does,
what he's good at.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.582
That's what he takes pride
in doing.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.334
Now he's trying
to be a dad.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.378
And that means he's gotta
wake up and sell used cars

25:46.420 --> 25:48.881
every morning
for Buddy Garrity.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.509
I can't take it personally
that he's not happy here.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.886
Matt, you can just
get angry.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.721
No, I can't.

25:55.721 --> 25:59.892
He's trying.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.266
I mean, what else
can you really ask of anyone?

26:17.407 --> 26:19.536

Getting gray hair
over this damn lawsuit.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.121
I'm getting a lot
of gray hair this week.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.164
And I'll tell you,
if this job gets cut out

27:04.164 --> 27:06.792
from under me, there ain't
gonna be no more coaching.
That's not gonna happen.

27:06.834 --> 27:07.793
No, that's what'll happen.

27:07.793 --> 27:11.088
Don't forget how good you are
at what you do.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.256
That's the problem,
it's not up to me.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.304
I know we gotta go
to the rodeo.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.140
Sorry, I know.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.268
So there's
this art house theater

27:24.309 --> 27:25.143
about 40 miles from here.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.229
I saw just Cocteau's
Beauty and the Beast.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.147
It was really cool.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.275
I mean, even Matt liked it.
Wait, pause.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.277
Matt goes to
foreign art films with you?

27:33.318 --> 27:35.445
Yeah.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.281
Uh, Smash does too.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.658
He thought it was
really interesting.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.993
Really?

27:41.034 --> 27:42.619
Man, what the hell
is Julie

27:42.661 --> 27:43.996
getting my ass into?

27:44.037 --> 27:46.707
Italian cinema?

27:46.707 --> 27:49.001
Hey, have you heard anything
about the game?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.002
Oh, you ain't hear?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.086
What?

27:51.128 --> 27:52.129
Danny blew a knee.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.672
No!

27:53.672 --> 27:55.007
No!

27:55.007 --> 27:56.466
Oh man, we're finished.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.594
Man, this is over.
We're done.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.429
Man, this ain't exactly
going the way I was hoping.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.015
What?

28:03.015 --> 28:03.849
What are you talking about?

28:03.891 --> 28:06.810
Man, I've never
known a girl like this.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.020
Like what?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.187
Like she won't
pay attention to me,

28:09.229 --> 28:11.315
but I know she likes me.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.357
Maybe that's just her way

28:12.399 --> 28:14.151
of getting you
to pay attention to her.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.611
I don't wanna
pay attention to her.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.279
I want her
to pay attention to me.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.322
Okay.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.365
That's how
I'm used to it.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.199
If you like her...

28:21.241 --> 28:24.369
maybe you should
get used to a new way.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.371
Wait, seriously,
Denny blew out his knee?

28:26.413 --> 28:30.542
[cheers and applause]

28:30.584 --> 28:32.502
Yeah, baby!
Yeah!

28:32.544 --> 28:35.380
I never thought
I'd be rooting for Buckley.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.716
Buddy Garrity.
Yes, Ma'am.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.053
I'm sorry, it was just on,
I swear.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.179
You promised.
No, I know‐‐I'm here.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.348
Hey, I'll be back.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.390
Would you come on now?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.683
You're with me, Buddy.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.186
Thanks.

28:52.606 --> 28:56.526
Hey, Mom, did you ever think
of moving out of Dillon?

28:56.568 --> 28:57.319
I did leave Dillon.

28:57.361 --> 29:00.072
I moved to Dallas
when I was 18.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.075
So then what happened‐‐I mean,
why'd you leave?

29:03.116 --> 29:04.826
I fell in love
with your father.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.288
I came up here
to visit and he wouldn't

29:08.288 --> 29:10.290
go to Dallas, so...
You never know.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.751
Hey.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.215
Just one second.
One second.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.258
Just for a minute.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.178
No drama.
Just for a minute, please.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.763
I can't explain this to her
anymore, I can't.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.223
This was too much, Bob.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.265
It was too much.

29:50.706 --> 29:51.832
You ready for this?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.166
Yep.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.253
Let's go.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.606
Tyra, people have fights.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.816
People do have fights.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.653
They don't
have fights every day.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.573
They don't let men
beat the hell out of them.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.576
Don't look at me
like that, honey.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.374
Mom, you know, I love you more
than anything in this world.

30:34.416 --> 30:38.170
So much.

30:38.211 --> 30:44.342
You're an amazing woman
and you are a damn good mother.

30:44.342 --> 30:48.180
But God, you are such a loser
when it comes to men.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.767
You're gonna let that man
back into our house,

30:51.808 --> 30:53.351
and I will not accept it.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.479
Well, it is not
your decision.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.607
I'm making it my decision.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.358
I love you too much
to watch him

31:00.400 --> 31:02.944
do that to you anymore.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.866
He comes back,
I'm moving out.

31:07.908 --> 31:09.367
Oh, Tyra, don't be silly‐‐

31:09.367 --> 31:12.704
I'm serious.

31:12.746 --> 31:16.458
It's him or me.
You choose.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.385
I could so take that guy.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.559
So, uh, how'd you like
that concert at UT?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.811
Concert at UT?

31:35.852 --> 31:37.020
Yeah.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.814
Oh, you mean the one
I went to

31:38.855 --> 31:40.357
with Matt and Julie.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.650
Yeah, that one.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.360
Come on, man.
Keep your feet solid!

31:43.401 --> 31:48.532
Okay, who'd you say you saw
perform at the concert?

31:48.573 --> 31:51.743
It was, uh, this band.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.411
Aw!

31:53.453 --> 31:56.456
What were they called?

31:56.498 --> 31:57.290
Do you even know?

31:57.332 --> 32:01.586
I mean, was it a band?
Or was it a man?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.587
Or was it a woman?

32:02.587 --> 32:05.924
Was it a symphony orchestra?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.884
Do you ever hang out
with Matt and Julie?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.262
I...

32:10.262 --> 32:12.889
You got 'em to lie to me?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.516
It's your own damn fault.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.519
You can't even see
what's right in front of you.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.604
I'm Smash.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.273
Ugh!

32:21.273 --> 32:23.692
Who wants to see me
take on this sorry ass

32:23.733 --> 32:25.068
arm wrestling champ?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.528
[cheering]

32:26.570 --> 32:27.863
That's right.
Yeah.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.573
I got five on it, baby.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.907
That's all you do is talk.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.702
Come on, baby, let's go.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.502
Hey.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.926
You okay?

32:49.968 --> 32:54.639
Not really.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.724
No.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.435
What's wrong?

32:58.476 --> 33:00.729
My mom's gonna be an idiot

33:00.770 --> 33:02.480
and let that jerk
back into our house.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.649
I'm sorry.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.944
There's a trait in the women
in my family

33:07.986 --> 33:12.616
that just drives men crazy.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.827
They treat us like crap
and always come back for more.

33:15.827 --> 33:20.540
That's, uh...

33:20.540 --> 33:24.085
That's actually what I was
here to talk to you about.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.631
I am truly sorry.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.674
For everything
that has happened.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.968
For what
I've put you through.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.472
Everything that happened.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.682
I was a complete jerk
and I am so sorry.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.816
If you would even consider
giving me a second chance, Tyra,

33:46.858 --> 33:52.530
believe me,
it'll be so different.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.867
Sorry.

33:55.867 --> 34:00.580
You know, so many times,
I would have loved...

34:00.622 --> 34:04.626
to hear those words
come out of your mouth.

34:04.668 --> 34:09.381
God, I'd love to say yes.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.049
But I'd hate myself
for it.

34:11.091 --> 34:15.971
I'd be a hypocrite,
you know?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.431
I guess timing's
everything.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.739
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

34:34.739 --> 34:35.907
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.909
The Smash, baby!

34:37.909 --> 34:39.619
[laughing]

35:29.794 --> 35:32.714
Ladies and gentlemen,
our first cowboy out tonight‐‐

35:32.756 --> 35:34.799
And, ladies and gentlemen,
here's a little treat for you.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.800
...has blocked the kick!

35:35.842 --> 35:37.052
They've got the ball!

35:37.093 --> 35:40.055
Across mid‐field!

35:40.096 --> 35:41.640
He's gonna score!

35:41.640 --> 35:43.725
He's gonna score!

35:43.767 --> 35:45.644
The 20, the 10!

35:45.685 --> 35:47.562
Touchdown!

35:47.604 --> 35:49.773
(rodeo announcer)
Dillon fans, get ready!

35:49.814 --> 35:52.776
We're going
to the playoffs!

35:52.817 --> 35:54.986
[cheering]

36:29.187 --> 36:36.277
♪ Comin' for
to carry me home ♪

36:36.319 --> 36:38.530
Thank you, Lord,
for letting Buckley win.

36:38.571 --> 36:42.367
I know that it was nothing
short of a miracle.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.119
And I thank you
for that miracle.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.414
I know you truly are
an all‐powerful God

36:47.414 --> 36:49.165
to let such a crap team win.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.083
I know I've sinned,

36:50.083 --> 36:52.127
but I have to ask
for one more thing.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.962
And I know that you know
what it is

36:54.003 --> 36:56.381
before I ask for it.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.383
The playoffs.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.219
State.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.178
If it's your will,

37:02.220 --> 37:05.056
let us win State,
dear God.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.101
In Jesus' name.
Amen.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.204
Coach.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.419
Listen.

37:34.461 --> 37:39.591
I just came out here
to let you know...

37:39.591 --> 37:42.010
that no matter
what anyone says,

37:42.051 --> 37:44.429
no matter what happens
with this whole lawsuit thing,

37:44.471 --> 37:47.265
just know that it was...

37:47.307 --> 37:51.019
it was not in my hands.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.270
And I was against it.

37:52.312 --> 37:56.649
And that you'll always
be my coach.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.296
Hey, Dad!
How's it goin'?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.381
Goin' good.
How you doin'?

38:20.423 --> 38:22.050
Good.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.135
Can I interest you
in a Malibu?

38:24.135 --> 38:27.555
Uh, yeah,
I wouldn't mind one.

38:27.597 --> 38:28.640
Um...

38:28.640 --> 38:31.476
Look...

38:31.518 --> 38:33.394
I know
that you hate it here.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.314
It's kind of obvious
in the mornings

38:36.356 --> 38:38.399
when you're getting dressed.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.400
And you're putting on
the Buddy Garrity

38:39.442 --> 38:40.485
American flag pin.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.070
I'll get used to it.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.488
I don't think you need to.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.990
I can keep
taking care of grandma

38:46.032 --> 38:47.492
and going to school,
it's okay.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.993
No, really, Dad.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.121
She's been
doing really well lately and...

38:52.163 --> 38:54.541
Look, you can go back
to Iraq.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.085
I know how much it means
to you to be there.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.504
And it means so much to me
that you wanted to stay here.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.507
But it's okay.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.509
I don't know
if I can agree to that.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.593
You can have
no legal guardian.

39:05.635 --> 39:09.639
Dad, I don't know that I can
let you not agree to that.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.189
Not really
much of a car salesman, am I?

39:18.231 --> 39:20.525
Yeah, but you're
a really good soldier.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.193
Sometimes
that doesn't mean much.

39:22.193 --> 39:25.488
Yeah, well,
sometimes it does.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.499
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

39:36.541 --> 39:38.626
I told you, it was him or me.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.546
I wasn't kidding.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.467
Tyra, did you
really think that

39:46.509 --> 39:52.098
I would choose a man
over my daughter?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.393
Well, I wouldn't.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.385
I'm sorry about last night.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.766
I'm sorry that I got
Matt and Julie to lie for me.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.186
They feel bad, you're pissed.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.606
And it's all my fault.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.441
And I'm truly sorry
about that.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.861
Yeah, me too.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.529
There's something else
I gotta say.

40:48.571 --> 40:54.202
Yeah, I like myself.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.664
And I love football.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.667
I love it.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.627
I love the game.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.295
I love the crowds.

41:04.337 --> 41:07.548
I love the attention.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.218
I love being a star.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.552
I can't help it.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.304
It's a beautiful thing.
It's just who I am.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.392
It's how God made me.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.810
I like you a lot, Waverly.

41:18.851 --> 41:22.647
I mean...

41:22.647 --> 41:24.315
more than I've ever liked
any other girl.

41:24.315 --> 41:28.569
But...

41:28.611 --> 41:30.154
if you don't like me
for me...

41:30.154 --> 41:32.573
then I gotta live with it.

41:32.615 --> 41:36.661
'Cause I can't be nobody
but the Smash.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.539
And yes, I like talking
about myself

41:39.580 --> 41:42.458
in the third person.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.501
Something tells me
deep down inside

41:43.543 --> 41:45.294
you like it too.

41:54.804 --> 41:58.224
I'll see you around, Smash.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.710
(Sammy Meade)
Sometimes the problem is
that what's gonna happen

42:25.710 --> 42:27.295
just isn't up to you.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.880
Then fate takes a turnaround
to the backyard

42:28.921 --> 42:32.300
and suddenly it is
all up to you.

42:32.341 --> 42:33.968
Brace yourself, Dillon.

42:34.010 --> 43:18.805
We're going into
a hell of a game.
