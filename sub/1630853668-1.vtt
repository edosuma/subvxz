Arnold house.

01:36.865 --> 01:38.238
David?

01:38.273 --> 01:39.404
Oh, hey Ava.

01:40.605 --> 01:42.209
What are you up to?

01:42.244 --> 01:43.309
Just looking at--

01:44.774 --> 01:46.510
Um, I'm just looking
at my card collection.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.578
<i> Cool.</i>

01:48.613 --> 01:49.843
Do you want
to come over

01:49.878 --> 01:51.317
and we can
look at them together?

01:51.352 --> 01:52.714
-Um...

01:53.915 --> 01:55.453
I don't-- I don't think

01:55.488 --> 01:57.323
that'd be
such a good idea right now.

01:57.358 --> 01:59.490
<i>I mean, I'd like to,</i>
<i>but I just can't right now.</i>

01:59.921 --> 02:01.525
Are you not allowed
to stay out late again?

02:03.430 --> 02:06.497
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.

02:06.532 --> 02:08.730
Well, I bet I can ask
my mom if you could stay over.

02:09.832 --> 02:11.502
-Mom.
-Uh, no.

02:11.537 --> 02:12.701
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

02:12.736 --> 02:13.867
<i>I'm pretty tired anyways.</i>

02:15.244 --> 02:17.178
Okay. Um...

02:18.478 --> 02:19.873
<i>what about tomorrow?</i>

02:20.909 --> 02:22.216
Maybe...

02:22.977 --> 02:24.251
noon?

02:25.419 --> 02:26.451
I'll be there.

02:26.882 --> 02:28.189
Great.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.323
Good night, David.

02:30.919 --> 02:32.193
Good night, Ava.

02:41.963 --> 02:43.369
Shh.

02:49.278 --> 02:50.442
...please, please, please!

02:50.477 --> 02:51.740
David,
where is your brother?

02:53.579 --> 02:54.941
You got
what's coming to him next

02:54.976 --> 02:56.613
if you don't fucking
tell me where he is now!

02:56.648 --> 02:58.219
-Do not yell at him.
-Shut up, Dianne!

03:02.489 --> 03:03.719
What are you doing?

03:03.754 --> 03:05.424
-Where is he?
-He's not in here.

03:05.459 --> 03:06.590
-Where is he?
-You're drunk

03:06.625 --> 03:07.525
and you need
to calm down.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.625
He's not in here!

03:10.024 --> 03:11.595
Matthew?
No, no, no, no, no.

03:11.630 --> 03:12.860
-Come on!

03:12.895 --> 03:14.598
Get out
from under there!

03:14.633 --> 03:15.764
Please, you're
going to hurt him, Matthew.

03:15.799 --> 03:16.963
Matthew, please.

03:16.998 --> 03:19.339
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, please, stop!

03:19.374 --> 03:21.671
The boy needs to learn
to respect his parents, huh?

03:21.706 --> 03:23.640
Going around school
telling parents and friends

03:23.675 --> 03:25.675
that I'm a bad father, huh?

03:25.710 --> 03:27.578
What kind of son
does that, huh?

03:27.613 --> 03:29.547
-You're hurting him.
-Is that what family does?

03:30.814 --> 03:32.649
I can't hear you, boy.

03:32.684 --> 03:33.815
Do you respect me now?

03:37.656 --> 03:38.820
Oh, my God.

03:40.989 --> 03:42.791
No, no, no!
Matthew, careful!

03:42.826 --> 03:44.430
Please don't hurt him!

03:44.465 --> 03:46.663
I'll teach you.
Or you a big boy now?

03:46.698 --> 03:48.995
Oh, a big tough
man are ya? Huh?

03:49.635 --> 03:51.701
Oh, David.

03:51.736 --> 03:53.868
Oh, David, no.

03:57.412 --> 03:58.906
That is it!

03:58.941 --> 04:01.315
Matthew! No!

04:01.350 --> 04:03.812
We are done!
We are through!

04:04.617 --> 04:05.715
I want you out!

04:06.487 --> 04:07.552
Is that
what you want?

04:10.359 --> 04:11.688
Good.

04:11.723 --> 04:13.426
'Cause I don't care
about any of you!

04:13.461 --> 04:14.922
In fact,
I hate all of you!

04:15.925 --> 04:18.024
Is this what you want?
Is that what you want there?

04:18.059 --> 04:19.960
Here.
Take it. Take it.

04:25.638 --> 04:27.539
Oh my God, baby boy.

04:27.574 --> 04:29.442
I'm so sorry.

04:31.006 --> 04:33.677
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

04:34.449 --> 04:36.911
Oh you mother fucker!

04:36.946 --> 04:39.782
I will kill you!
Get out of my house!

05:21.628 --> 05:23.089
So let me
get this straight.

05:23.124 --> 05:25.498
You're saying that
in a seven-game series,

05:25.533 --> 05:26.994
you wouldn't use
the same pitcher twice

05:27.029 --> 05:28.534
if he didn't
pitch well the first time?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.505
What?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.100
Doesn't who's pitching
matter to you?

05:34.135 --> 05:36.509
-Or is your answer the same?
-No, it doesn't matter.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.973
So, what, if Nichols ends up
losing this game for us--

05:39.008 --> 05:41.481
-Which he will.
-He shouldn't pitch

05:41.516 --> 05:42.911
the rest of the series?

05:42.946 --> 05:45.111
No, he had
his chance, he blew it.

05:45.817 --> 05:47.586
Move onto the next guy,
it's that simple.

05:47.621 --> 05:49.786
David,
it's game one of the series.

05:49.821 --> 05:51.821
The Majors
run a five-man rotation,

05:51.856 --> 05:54.824
and Nichols
is arguably our best pitcher.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.958
I don't know
what you want me to say, Jack.

05:56.993 --> 05:58.157
Hey guys.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.533
-Ava.
-What's up?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.062
-Question.
-Fire away.

06:02.097 --> 06:03.734
If your best pitcher

06:03.769 --> 06:06.033
is pitching
game one of a series

06:06.068 --> 06:08.673
and he doesn't do well
in his first game,

06:08.708 --> 06:10.741
do you use
him again in the series?

06:12.877 --> 06:13.975
Is he drunk?

06:14.813 --> 06:16.912
Are you even
old enough to be in here?

06:16.947 --> 06:18.782
Shh, I need you
to take this seriously.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.818
To put it simply...

06:22.788 --> 06:25.052
do you believe
in second chances?

06:29.091 --> 06:31.696
If it's deserved,
then yeah, why not?

06:31.731 --> 06:34.534
I think most people deserve
a second chance in life.

06:34.569 --> 06:36.767
Finally,
someone agrees with me.

06:36.802 --> 06:38.604
'Cause David over here
doesn't think so.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.672
Oh, tough guy, eh?

06:43.710 --> 06:46.139
All right,
I'm going to take a leak.

06:46.977 --> 06:49.175
You two... reconnect.

06:57.790 --> 06:58.822
How are you?

06:59.957 --> 07:01.891
-Good. How are you?
-I'm good.

07:02.696 --> 07:04.157
How's your mom?

07:05.765 --> 07:07.193
Well,
she's seen better days.

07:07.228 --> 07:08.964
She's all right.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.703
We had dinner
before heading there.

07:11.738 --> 07:13.639
-No way, Dylan's there.
-Really?

07:13.674 --> 07:16.004
Yeah, he's at the game.
Did you guys see him?

07:16.039 --> 07:17.137
No,
we must have missed him.

07:18.173 --> 07:20.239
Anyway, uh, how is he?

07:20.879 --> 07:22.582
Dylan?
He's good.

07:22.617 --> 07:24.111
He starts
kindergarten soon.

07:25.015 --> 07:26.080
Here.

07:27.721 --> 07:28.951
Hoo.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.920
Yeah,
he's really excited

07:30.955 --> 07:32.218
for baseball to start up.

07:32.253 --> 07:34.121
Like, it's all
he's talking about.

07:34.156 --> 07:36.695
Yeah, sure. He gonna be good?

07:36.730 --> 07:39.192
Well,
maybe not as good as you,

07:39.227 --> 07:41.161
but, yeah,
I think he'll be good.

07:41.196 --> 07:43.537
He could learn
a thing or two about batting

07:43.572 --> 07:45.033
if I'm being
completely honest.

07:49.270 --> 07:50.577
Oh, no.

07:54.011 --> 07:55.582
What happened?

07:55.617 --> 07:58.750
Fucking...
Coach Daniels just texted me.

07:58.785 --> 07:59.883
Oh?

08:01.887 --> 08:03.051
I got cut.

08:05.594 --> 08:08.023
-I'm sorry, Jack.
-Baseball?

08:09.092 --> 08:10.256
Oh, that sucks.

08:10.962 --> 08:12.060
Whatever.

08:12.095 --> 08:13.193
Can we go?

08:15.362 --> 08:16.669
Sure.

08:19.773 --> 08:21.674
Well, I guess--

08:22.644 --> 08:23.709
I guess
we're leaving.

08:30.685 --> 08:31.783
What?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.185
Here.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.091
-Really?

08:43.126 --> 08:44.796
Oh, shit.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.954
You know what?

09:10.989 --> 09:12.626
Screw Coach Daniels anyways.

09:12.661 --> 09:14.155
If he doesn't want me,

09:14.190 --> 09:15.959
then I don't want
to be on the team.

09:15.994 --> 09:18.225
Most Juniors don't make it
to varsity anyway.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.700
-You did.
-I worked for it.

09:20.735 --> 09:22.394
And what, I didn't?

09:22.429 --> 09:25.265
Jack, you spend all your time
inside playing video games.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.234
-What do you expect?
-I put in the work.

09:27.269 --> 09:28.873
You just never see me.

09:28.908 --> 09:30.270
I don't see you
'cause you don't practice.

09:30.305 --> 09:32.107
-Yes, I do.
-When?

09:32.142 --> 09:34.109
I worked my ass off
for that spot on the team!

09:34.144 --> 09:36.045
Oh, and what
do you want me to do?

09:37.048 --> 09:38.179
Text Coach.

09:38.214 --> 09:40.049
And say what?

09:40.084 --> 09:41.347
I'm your younger brother.

09:41.382 --> 09:42.854
I come
from the same genes as you!

09:42.889 --> 09:44.757
Tell him
to give me a spot on the team.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.956
I'm not
going to do that, Jack.

09:45.991 --> 09:47.353
Why not?
I'm telling you,

09:47.388 --> 09:48.992
I'm as good
as any player on that team.

09:49.027 --> 09:50.389
Coach just
has it out for me.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.028
If you set him straight,
I'll be running laps

09:52.063 --> 09:53.667
around those losers
by the end of the season.

09:53.702 --> 09:55.394
-Watch the road.
-The one time I ask you

09:55.429 --> 09:56.934
for a favor,
you let me down?

09:56.969 --> 09:58.738
You don't think
I'm good enough, do you?

09:58.773 --> 10:00.135
-Jackson, the road!
-What's a big brother for then?

10:00.170 --> 10:01.840
Aren't you supposed
to watch out for me?

10:01.875 --> 10:03.138
-Pull over!

10:03.173 --> 10:04.645
in control
of everything!

10:23.457 --> 10:25.028
He hit the pole.

10:55.192 --> 10:56.427
Are they okay?

11:00.296 --> 11:01.999
Everything all right?

11:07.776 --> 11:08.841
We gotta go!

11:09.470 --> 11:11.239
We gotta go, man.
Nobody saw anything.

11:11.274 --> 11:12.471
We could just go.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.011
The cops
will be here fast.

11:14.046 --> 11:15.309
They'll be okay.
We gotta go!

11:24.859 --> 11:26.089
There's a kid?

11:27.026 --> 11:28.157
It's Dylan.

11:28.995 --> 11:30.456
What?

11:30.491 --> 11:32.194
It's Ava's kid.

11:32.229 --> 11:34.097
And that's his dad,
dead in the driver's seat.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.364
What--

11:38.070 --> 11:39.102
I can't--

11:40.303 --> 11:41.467
The cops will come
with an ambulance.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.271
They'll be fine.

11:43.306 --> 11:44.910
We're faster,
we're closer to the hospital.

11:44.945 --> 11:46.373
We can get there
faster than they can get here.

11:46.408 --> 11:47.506
-David--
-Jackson!

11:47.541 --> 11:51.785
♪

13:46.000 --> 13:48.462
Hey, welcome home, baby.

13:48.497 --> 13:54.468
♪

14:00.707 --> 14:01.981
All right.

14:07.582 --> 14:10.055
Don't! Sit.
I got it.

14:11.993 --> 14:13.190
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

14:22.135 --> 14:23.497
I see you kept the car.

14:26.975 --> 14:30.273
Yeah, yeah,
what was I gonna do, sell it?

14:35.577 --> 14:36.675
Jack couldn't make it?

14:37.778 --> 14:40.151
Oh, I don't know
what your brother's doing.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.285
What do you mean?

14:42.320 --> 14:43.616
Well, he hasn't been around
to see me in months.

14:48.260 --> 14:49.457
Actually it's...

14:50.658 --> 14:52.163
probably been
about a year now.

14:53.529 --> 14:55.133
Now that I start
thinking about it.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.171
Well,
I'll go see him.

15:21.392 --> 15:22.589
Who is it?

15:24.197 --> 15:25.493
It's me, Jackson.

15:26.727 --> 15:28.067
What do you want?

15:30.269 --> 15:31.334
I'm back.

15:36.176 --> 15:37.274
Do you want
to get lunch?

15:38.310 --> 15:40.244
Nah. Can't.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.247
Why?

15:43.282 --> 15:44.347
I'm busy.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.185
Jackson, open the door.

15:47.220 --> 15:48.351
I'm not
talking to you like this.

15:51.653 --> 15:52.751
You see me now.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.325
What do you want?

15:56.394 --> 15:57.459
Hey.

16:02.103 --> 16:03.729
I'm heading for lunch.
Do you want to come?

16:04.567 --> 16:05.632
No.

16:06.701 --> 16:07.766
Why not?

16:08.406 --> 16:09.504
-Busy.

16:13.741 --> 16:15.246
I saw the
Chevelle's at home and...

16:15.842 --> 16:17.149
surprised
you didn't take it.

16:18.152 --> 16:19.514
You think Mom
would ever give it to me?

16:21.386 --> 16:23.650
Yeah. She says you hadn't
been around in a while.

16:24.653 --> 16:25.784
Why would I be?

16:26.523 --> 16:27.621
Is something wrong?

16:29.097 --> 16:30.327
You tell me.

16:52.582 --> 16:53.680
You okay?

16:54.518 --> 16:56.089
I-- I got
an interview today.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.091
Where?

16:58.126 --> 16:59.488
Well, I texted Coach.

16:59.523 --> 17:01.094
I asked if I could
get a job doing something

17:01.129 --> 17:02.260
at the field, you know?

17:03.164 --> 17:04.361
Maybe coaching.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.429
Hopefully coaching.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.201
That's great, honey.

17:16.573 --> 17:18.639
Son,
how have you been?

17:18.674 --> 17:19.739
Good.

17:21.314 --> 17:22.445
How's the mom?

17:23.151 --> 17:24.744
She's all right.
Thanks for asking.

17:26.286 --> 17:27.450
So...

17:27.485 --> 17:28.715
what can I do for you?

17:30.356 --> 17:32.554
Well, Coach, I need a--

17:32.589 --> 17:35.392
I-- I--
I want a job.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.131
You know, I'm thinking
I could make a great coach.

17:39.530 --> 17:42.234
David, it's mid-season.

17:43.534 --> 17:44.731
We ain't got any jobs.

17:46.570 --> 17:47.734
And even if I did...

17:48.704 --> 17:51.144
would that really be
the best thing?

17:52.444 --> 17:54.840
Well, I've always been one
of your best players, you know,

17:54.875 --> 17:56.611
and I think I could make
an excellent addition

17:56.646 --> 17:57.876
to the coaching staff.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.482
You know, I know
a lot of players go

17:59.517 --> 18:01.418
-from player to coach--
-David. David.

18:02.718 --> 18:04.454
I'm not denying
your talent.

18:04.885 --> 18:06.159
Trust me.

18:07.591 --> 18:09.294
I just--

18:10.957 --> 18:12.693
I just can't
do it right now, son.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.762
The moms in these
leagues would kill me.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.371
Maybe next season,

18:20.406 --> 18:21.669
maybe some
father will drop out

18:21.704 --> 18:22.868
of coaching
a Little League team.

18:23.838 --> 18:26.344
And by that time,
the storm will blow over,

18:26.379 --> 18:28.313
and it'll be
an afterthought in your life.

18:29.877 --> 18:31.151
Yeah.

18:34.288 --> 18:36.222
Here. How's this.

18:38.490 --> 18:40.358
You know what?
You know what I got?

18:40.789 --> 18:43.658
I got this umpire gig
for a Little League division.

18:44.265 --> 18:46.463
The guy doing the job
doesn't show up on time.

18:49.567 --> 18:50.599
Hell.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.865
You'd be
wearing a mask.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.901
It'd be a solution
for everyone.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.211

19:08.784 --> 19:09.849
So...

19:10.852 --> 19:12.225
how did it go?

19:14.559 --> 19:15.624
I got it.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.266
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you!

19:21.269 --> 19:22.334
What team?

19:23.370 --> 19:24.534
What?

19:24.569 --> 19:25.931
What team
are you coaching?

19:28.309 --> 19:30.936
Oh,
it's a Little League team.

19:33.413 --> 19:34.544
Good for you, David.

19:35.811 --> 19:36.909
Yeah.

19:40.684 --> 19:41.947
Look,
I'm going for a walk.

19:42.752 --> 19:43.817
Do you want to come?

20:00.704 --> 20:01.802
I just saw Jackson.

20:04.906 --> 20:05.971
And?

20:11.451 --> 20:13.352
Oh, honey,
he's-- he's just--

20:13.387 --> 20:15.915
he hasn't recovered
from the accident...

20:17.017 --> 20:18.291
mentally.

20:18.326 --> 20:19.391
Mentally.

20:20.988 --> 20:22.856
I don't think
he ever will, to be honest.

20:23.661 --> 20:25.529
Most people handle
things differently.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.930
He was always
the emotional one, David.

20:30.965 --> 20:34.670
He will always have a bigger
and longer reaction to things.

20:40.579 --> 20:42.513
He's so grateful
for what you did for him.

20:44.748 --> 20:45.813
But he's just...

20:46.916 --> 20:49.751
he suffered in a much
different way than you did.

20:56.991 --> 20:58.298
One sec.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.455
David.

21:58.921 --> 21:59.986
What the hell was that?

22:00.989 --> 22:03.660
-Was that who I think it was?
-Yes, it was.

22:03.695 --> 22:05.431
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

22:05.862 --> 22:07.730
We remained
close over the years, David.

22:07.765 --> 22:09.501
We were family friends before
it happened, you know that.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.931

you're best friends now?

She's renovating the house.
I help her paint.

22:22.450 --> 22:24.010
Mom, do you know
what I did to them?

22:24.045 --> 22:25.077
No.

-David, she needed to know.
-We talked about this.

That isn't
your place to do that.

22:34.660 --> 22:35.857

He remembers
something happened, but...

36:30.660 --> 36:31.890
he doesn't know what.

36:31.925 --> 36:33.958
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

36:36.798 --> 36:38.897
He doesn't remember
anything about his father.

36:38.932 --> 36:40.371
And I know
he's curious.

36:42.507 --> 36:43.869
But he's just
not ready yet.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.745
I remember
when I first went in.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.353
My mom
would visit every Monday.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.016
She'd visit me
every Monday

36:59.051 --> 37:00.853
for the first four
years I was there,

37:00.888 --> 37:02.987
and she'd come with that week's
update on the Majors.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
I swear,
she went to every game.

37:08.995 --> 37:11.501
She knew all the players,
how they played,

37:11.536 --> 37:13.932
even all their places
in the standings.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.638
She was
a great woman.

37:16.673 --> 37:18.035
Yeah, but that's the thing.
She didn't like baseball.

37:18.609 --> 37:19.773
-I thought she did.
-No.

37:20.413 --> 37:21.841
Well,
my dad liked baseball.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.645
She didn't-- she
didn't really care much for it.

37:24.813 --> 37:27.011
Of course she came
to my games when I was a kid.

37:27.046 --> 37:28.881
Jackson and my dad
did too, but...

37:30.423 --> 37:32.324
She'd never go to a game
that didn't involve us.

37:32.359 --> 37:33.424
She said
it was too boring.

37:37.991 --> 37:41.564
Jackson and I went
to every Majors game we could.

37:41.599 --> 37:42.994
We were
their biggest fans.

37:43.733 --> 37:45.304
Absolute die hards.

37:45.933 --> 37:47.669
And since
I couldn't go anymore...

37:48.771 --> 37:49.637
she'd go for me.

37:51.543 --> 37:53.411
She'd take
multiple nights off each week

37:53.446 --> 37:54.709
just to go
to baseball games

37:54.744 --> 37:55.875
that she didn't
give a shit about.

37:56.812 --> 37:58.482
Just as an excuse

37:58.517 --> 38:00.352
to be able to talk to me
about something on Monday.

38:04.886 --> 38:06.556
Ended up
watching the games anyway.

38:07.988 --> 38:10.461
I think she didn't think
we had TV in there,

38:10.496 --> 38:12.056
but I never told her.

38:13.433 --> 38:15.334
I just kind of liked hearing
her explain it, you know?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.030
She'd come every Monday
and give me the rundown

38:19.065 --> 38:20.636
on what happened
in each game and...

38:27.007 --> 38:28.072
that's my mom.

38:56.003 --> 38:57.068
You holding up?

39:00.447 --> 39:01.941
Oh yeah, man.

39:01.976 --> 39:03.448
Holding up so good.

39:05.012 --> 39:06.748
You want
to talk about it?

39:06.783 --> 39:09.784
Older bro checking up on
his younger, troubled brother.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.852
-So touching.
-Yeah, where have you been?

39:12.789 --> 39:15.493
I've been busy getting
none of Mom's inheritance.

39:15.528 --> 39:16.626
Who told you that?

39:16.661 --> 39:17.726
No one.

39:18.762 --> 39:20.432
That's how I knew.

39:20.467 --> 39:22.401
No call,
no inheritance.

39:24.966 --> 39:26.702
I saw you
with Dad at the funeral.

39:29.509 --> 39:31.542
He's been
helping me out lately.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.675
Sure.

39:34.239 --> 39:35.777
I don't know,
he's just--

39:36.681 --> 39:39.110
he's been helping me
back on my feet, you know?

39:40.982 --> 39:42.487
You forgive him?

39:42.522 --> 39:43.719
It's not like that.

39:45.756 --> 39:47.954
He's been good for like
five years now or something.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.056
I don't know,
that AA shit...

39:51.894 --> 39:52.992

39:53.027 --> 39:54.466
Hmm.

39:54.501 --> 39:56.435
Is this part
of your program?

39:57.064 --> 39:58.734
I'm not
in any program.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.835
I don't need
no program.

40:00.870 --> 40:01.968

40:03.004 --> 40:05.004
I can quit

don't want to.

to remember this, Jackson.

in our household...

40:18.217 --> 40:19.920
things he did
to you, to us...

were unforgivable.

52:08.531 --> 52:09.926
Woo-hoo!

52:10.830 --> 52:12.797
Woo! Go, go, go!

52:12.832 --> 52:15.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, Dylan!

52:15.967 --> 52:20.739
Woo-hoo!
Look at him go! Yeah!

52:20.774 --> 52:23.742
Hey! Look at that.
You're on TV!

52:23.777 --> 52:25.249
Woo-hoo!

52:30.619 --> 52:31.750
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

52:40.926 --> 52:42.200
.

52:43.896 --> 52:45.863
Okay everyone,
five more minutes

52:45.898 --> 52:47.799
and then
we will show the class.

52:49.704 --> 52:51.341
So, how are things?

52:51.376 --> 52:52.870
I'm great.

52:53.741 --> 52:54.971
And Dylan?

52:55.006 --> 52:56.643
He is at
a baseball game right now,

52:56.678 --> 52:59.250
so I assume
he's pretty happy as well.

52:59.285 --> 53:01.384
I thought you always booked
off work because of the games.

53:01.419 --> 53:04.222
No, not his.
He's at a Majors game.

53:04.719 --> 53:07.258
Oh, that's cool.
Who'd he go with? A friend?

53:08.558 --> 53:09.821
You could say that.

53:09.856 --> 53:13.396
Yeah, he's there
with a friend of mine

53:13.431 --> 53:15.926
where he's, um,
maybe a little bit more

53:15.961 --> 53:17.400
than a friend
to the both of us.

53:17.435 --> 53:18.830
But yes, a friend.
A friend.

53:18.865 --> 53:21.272
And does this friend
happen to have a name?

53:21.307 --> 53:23.736
Yes, Jessica.
He has a name.

53:24.541 --> 53:26.739
Um, it's David.

53:28.512 --> 53:29.610
From school.

53:30.976 --> 53:32.008
David.

53:33.011 --> 53:34.648
-Like, "David" David?
-Yeah.

53:35.984 --> 53:37.948
Just to be clear, we're talking
about the one who killed Scott?

53:37.983 --> 53:39.389
Oh, my God. Yes.

53:40.392 --> 53:41.985
Yes, Scott,
my ex-boyfriend,

53:42.020 --> 53:43.987
thank you so much
for reminding me.

53:44.022 --> 53:45.527
But he didn't
mean to do it.

53:45.562 --> 53:46.726
I've explained this
to you already.

53:46.761 --> 53:48.365
Yeah, he saved Dylan.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.268
But how did Dylan get there?
Because of David.

53:51.898 --> 53:53.436
I'm obviously
missing something here.

53:54.065 --> 53:55.405
You wouldn't understand.

53:56.870 --> 53:57.968
Ava, look at me.

54:02.711 --> 54:04.645
Oh my God,
you're sleeping with him.

54:04.680 --> 54:05.910
No. What?

54:05.945 --> 54:07.010
Jessica,
I am not sleeping with him.

54:07.045 --> 54:08.616
Keep your voice down.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.014
Like, I knew
you always had a crush on him,

54:11.049 --> 54:12.587
but I didn't
think you'd date him--

54:12.622 --> 54:15.051
Okay, can you just
finish the class for me?

54:16.626 --> 54:17.922
I didn't mean to upset you.

54:17.957 --> 54:19.891
-I'm just looking out for you.
-I know.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.498
I know.

54:25.437 --> 54:26.535
Careful.

54:27.604 --> 54:28.900
Well,
what are we gonna do now?

54:28.935 --> 54:30.572
-I don't know.
-I don't know either.

54:30.607 --> 54:32.101
I guess we're going
to have to get ice cream.

54:32.136 --> 54:33.905
-Hey!
-Jackson.

54:33.940 --> 54:35.841
Is that who I think it is?

54:35.876 --> 54:37.678
Here, just go wait up at the
lights, I'll meet you up there.

54:37.713 --> 54:39.009
Answer!

54:39.044 --> 54:40.648
-Jackson, calm down.
-No.

54:40.683 --> 54:41.913
What are you
doing with him?

54:41.948 --> 54:43.651
Well, we just went
to the game, man.

54:43.686 --> 54:45.785
I thought we were finally
putting this is behind us.

54:45.820 --> 54:47.886
Now you're--
you told him, didn't you?

54:47.921 --> 54:50.922
That-- that I did it.
That I'm the bad guy. Right?

54:50.957 --> 54:52.495
They could
still press charges!

54:52.530 --> 54:54.596
-What has this man told--

54:54.631 --> 54:56.829
-Get off of me!
-Shut the fuck up, hey!

54:56.864 --> 54:58.369
-Get off of me!
-Shut up!

54:58.404 --> 54:59.799
Dad, stop!

55:03.970 --> 55:06.839
Don't hurt him.
I'm okay.

55:08.942 --> 55:10.007
So, what?

55:10.042 --> 55:12.009
You're a daddy figure now?

55:24.925 --> 55:26.694
Does he know?

55:26.729 --> 55:27.794
No.

55:29.567 --> 55:31.633
You never lose, do you?

55:31.668 --> 55:33.668
-Jackson.
-Get the fuck off me.

55:39.742 --> 55:41.137
All right.
Look at me. Look at me.

55:41.172 --> 55:42.974
Look at my feet. Okay?

55:43.713 --> 55:45.042
When you swing,
your front foot

55:45.077 --> 55:47.418
should step forward
like that, okay?

55:47.453 --> 55:48.815
And your back foot
should pivot.

55:49.818 --> 55:51.081
That's right.
Okay.

55:51.116 --> 55:52.918
Now, full motion
should look like this.

55:55.461 --> 55:57.461
-Hey, Ave.
-"Ave?"

55:57.496 --> 55:59.397
Dylan just wanted me
to help him with his swing.

56:00.026 --> 56:01.124
Um...

56:02.193 --> 56:04.468
can I talk
to you outside for a sec?

56:06.131 --> 56:07.405
Sure.

56:08.969 --> 56:10.639
Here.
All right, line it up.

56:10.674 --> 56:11.739
Okay?
I'll be right back.

56:21.817 --> 56:23.553
What's up?

56:23.588 --> 56:24.653
Um...

Dylan called me
"Dad" today.

56:29.528 --> 56:30.593
What?

56:31.090 --> 56:32.155
What?

56:36.128 --> 56:38.095
I-- I don't know
how to respond to that.

56:38.130 --> 56:39.503
What do you mean?

56:41.870 --> 56:43.199
He thinks
you're his dad, David.

56:43.234 --> 56:44.267
Ever since
you showed up.

56:45.940 --> 56:49.810
I don't know if it's some
sense he believes he has.

56:49.845 --> 56:52.010
It's why he wants
to see you all the time.

56:53.915 --> 56:55.453
He's curious.

56:57.754 --> 56:59.952
Just don't--
don't bring this up with him

56:59.987 --> 57:02.218
and hopefully
he will just forget about it.

57:05.729 --> 57:07.630
I cannot deal
with this right now.

57:07.665 --> 57:08.829
Well, I can.
