00:00.651 --> 00:02.318
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.352 --> 00:04.620
You're getting out today,
huh? That's what we heard.

00:04.655 --> 00:06.522
Hello, if you need a pill, call Kelsey.

00:06.556 --> 00:07.623
What's it gonna be, Kelsey?
Where'd you get the drugs?

00:07.658 --> 00:08.724
So what happened?

00:08.759 --> 00:10.593
They think that I stole
your brother's pills.

00:10.627 --> 00:12.762
- What'd you tell them?
- I didn't tell them

00:12.796 --> 00:14.397
- it was you.
- Why not?

00:15.532 --> 00:16.565
Why do you have to ruin everything?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.601
- Jude, stop.
- They were gonna keep us.

00:18.635 --> 00:21.437
Well, you don't just ruin things
for you, you ruin them for me too.

00:21.471 --> 00:23.306
Everything ok?

00:23.340 --> 00:24.440
She ran away.

00:24.474 --> 00:26.442
- What about Jude?
- He's better off without me.

00:26.476 --> 00:29.378
- Where's Callie?
- Callie!

00:29.413 --> 00:31.347
- Hey, you gotta pay for that.
- I don't have any money.

00:31.381 --> 00:33.482
Hey, you take one bite of that candy bar,

00:33.517 --> 00:35.751
I'm gonna call the cops. One bite!

00:56.406 --> 00:59.642
Callie, I'm Ed Craig, your new P.O.

01:00.510 --> 01:01.510
Have a seat.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.316
- How're you doing in here?
- Ok.

01:07.351 --> 01:09.285
This is your second time in juvie?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.387
Yeah.

01:11.421 --> 01:15.291
You were in last time for taking
a bat to your foster father's car?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.460
He was beating my little
brother at the time.

01:18.695 --> 01:19.662
You love your brother?

01:21.798 --> 01:23.466
Of course.

01:25.402 --> 01:27.408
Just two weeks ago you
told your social worker

01:27.409 --> 01:28.940
you liked your new foster home.

01:29.773 --> 01:31.340
Did something change?

01:34.344 --> 01:35.678
They asked us if they could adopt us.

01:35.712 --> 01:36.746
And that's not what you want?

01:36.780 --> 01:40.583
I'm sixteen. I don't need to be adopted.

01:40.617 --> 01:42.518
Any idea what you do need?

01:42.552 --> 01:46.555
Yeah... to be out of
the system... on my own.

01:46.590 --> 01:49.692
Then why'd you get yourself
arrested and sent back here?

01:51.728 --> 01:54.397
Callie, you're still a kid.

01:54.431 --> 01:57.633
Like it or not, you need
an adult to care for you.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.369
Whether it's in the system or
back with your foster moms...

02:00.404 --> 02:03.339
No, I can't go back there.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.708
You can send me to a different foster home,

02:05.742 --> 02:07.576
or leave me here, I don't care.

02:07.611 --> 02:13.315
Just... I want them to
adopt my little brother.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.450
I do.

02:14.484 --> 02:17.586
So, just tell them...

02:20.490 --> 02:21.524
To give up on you?

02:36.640 --> 02:38.674
So... I'm going back to work next week.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.609
Just wanted to let everybody know.

02:45.515 --> 02:47.316
What about dad?

02:47.350 --> 02:49.752
Captain Roberts says that he
should be cleared in a couple days.

02:51.555 --> 02:52.621
Are you scared?

02:52.656 --> 02:54.490
I'm not. Are you?

02:54.524 --> 02:55.724
A little.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.759
Yeah?

02:56.793 --> 02:59.462
Can't you get like a desk job or something?

03:01.398 --> 03:02.374
Did you know being a cop

03:02.375 --> 03:04.935
is not even one of the top
ten most dangerous professions?

03:05.602 --> 03:09.472
That's true. We're lucky she's
not an airplane pilot. Or a logger.

03:09.506 --> 03:12.341
- Or a crab fisherman. That's very dangerous.
- Or an ice road trucker.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.509
Is that what it's called
an "ice road trucker"?

03:13.543 --> 03:14.577
What's gonna happen to Callie?

03:17.681 --> 03:20.649
Well, tomorrow, sweetheart,
she gets to go before the judge

03:20.684 --> 03:23.385
and the judge will decide if
she gets more probation or...

03:23.420 --> 03:27.723
Stays in juvie? She got beat up last time.

03:27.757 --> 03:30.759
I know it's scary, sweetheart,
but we're gonna do whatever we can.

03:31.661 --> 03:32.761
Can we go to court with you?

03:36.433 --> 03:37.666
What?

03:39.402 --> 03:41.403
Callie doesn't want us to be there.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.805
Too bad.

03:42.839 --> 03:45.474
You have to talk to the judge,
right? So that way she can come home.

03:45.509 --> 03:48.377
Unless you don't want her anymore.

03:48.411 --> 03:49.478
Of course we want her.

03:49.513 --> 03:51.447
It is not a question of
whether we want Callie.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.481
It is...

03:53.517 --> 03:55.584
it is whether she wants us.

03:55.619 --> 03:58.554
- She does.
- She ran away, Brandon. For no reason.

03:58.588 --> 04:00.289
I'm not really sure that
she wants to be here.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.690
She didn't run away for no reason.

04:06.296 --> 04:07.496
Is there something you
want to share with us?

04:07.531 --> 04:08.597
Something you know that we don't?

04:14.371 --> 04:15.604
She ran away because I kissed her.

05:02.807 --> 05:07.004
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:09.326 --> 05:12.428
- When did this happen?
- At the wedding.

05:12.462 --> 05:14.597
- When at our wedding?
- Honey...

05:15.665 --> 05:17.266
Do you have any idea what you've done?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.634
I didn't expect this to happen.

05:18.668 --> 05:20.436
Well, what did you expect?

05:20.470 --> 05:21.503
- Let's just take a second.
- No.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.539
You expected that we were gonna adopt her

05:23.573 --> 05:24.540
and the two of you would date?

05:24.574 --> 05:25.574
I don't know!

05:25.609 --> 05:27.409
I... I can't.

05:27.444 --> 05:31.614
Brandon, did Callie run away
because she didn't feel safe?

05:33.450 --> 05:35.417
What? No. No!

05:35.452 --> 05:38.387
Jude saw us. And he freaked out.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.623
He said that you guys wouldn't
adopt them. That's why she left,

05:40.657 --> 05:42.591
so she wouldn't screw things up for him.

05:42.626 --> 05:45.561
Honey. If CPS found out,

05:45.595 --> 05:47.763
they could take Callie
and Jude out of this house.

05:47.797 --> 05:49.365
You knew that, Brandon. I warned you.

05:49.399 --> 05:50.633
- I'm sorry.
- Well, sorry doesn't hack it.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.401
I can't help how I feel.

05:55.672 --> 05:56.705
Go inside, please.

05:57.674 --> 05:58.707
We need to talk.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.622
Are you so horny you can't keep
your hands off our foster sister?

06:13.657 --> 06:15.591
Ok, you know what? She kissed me too.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.626
I'm tired of everyone's making
me seem like I'm some sort of...

06:17.661 --> 06:19.595
- Liam?
- Screw you.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.629
I'm surprised you haven't tried.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.398
Mariana, that's gross.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.433
Look, I didn't grow up with Callie.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.702
She's been here two months
and until a few days ago,

06:26.736 --> 06:28.504
this was only supposed
to be a temporary thing.

06:28.538 --> 06:30.439
Well, then, why would you
say that we could adopt them?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.607
Because I wanted her to be happy.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.709
And you think she's happy now? In juvie?

06:33.743 --> 06:35.611
I don't expect you to understand.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.712
Ok, you've never even had a boyfriend.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.549
Well, you know what I can understand?

06:40.583 --> 06:42.651
You've royally screwed this whole family.

06:45.689 --> 06:47.623
Look, you get it, right?

06:47.657 --> 06:49.324
You couldn't help how you felt about Lexi.

06:49.359 --> 06:50.592
We weren't gonna adopt Lexi.

06:52.595 --> 06:54.363
Why did you tell?

06:54.397 --> 06:56.331
Because now that they know why she left,

06:56.366 --> 06:57.533
they'll bring her back.

06:59.536 --> 07:01.841
- I should have seen this was happening.
- Me too.

07:01.845 --> 07:02.975
When did we become these parents

07:02.976 --> 07:06.434
who have no idea what the hell is
going on underneath their own roof?

07:06.630 --> 07:08.225
When we became the parents of teenagers.

07:08.350 --> 07:11.485
Who are impulsive and secretive.

07:11.519 --> 07:13.187
Even the Brandons.

07:13.221 --> 07:14.488
What are we gonna do?

07:16.358 --> 07:17.491
Hey, sweetheart.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.060
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

07:20.095 --> 07:23.297
Come here and sit, please.

07:23.331 --> 07:26.200
We want you to know that
this does not change anything.

07:26.234 --> 07:27.434
It does not change how much we love you.

07:27.469 --> 07:30.237
And want to adopt you. Ok?

07:30.271 --> 07:32.072
Well, what about Callie?

07:32.107 --> 07:34.108
We're not giving up on either one of you.

07:35.243 --> 07:36.243
I promise.

07:42.384 --> 07:44.118
Callie Jacob?

07:51.459 --> 07:55.262
Just nine weeks out of juvie
and you're back for running away,

07:55.296 --> 07:57.498
violating your probation and stealing.

07:57.532 --> 08:00.100
Do you have anything you want to say?

08:00.135 --> 08:02.002
No...

08:02.036 --> 08:04.004
Your Honor.

08:04.038 --> 08:06.473
Your Honor, Callie's foster
moms are present in the court,

08:06.508 --> 08:10.144
and would like to speak on her behalf.

08:10.178 --> 08:11.311
Go ahead.

08:15.483 --> 08:19.420
Your Honor, in the time that
Callie has been with my wife and me

08:19.454 --> 08:23.357
and our three other children,
we saw her make great strides.

08:23.391 --> 08:26.326
She opened up to us emotionally,
she did well in school,

08:26.361 --> 08:28.195
she followed our rules,

08:28.229 --> 08:32.065
and we feel that she has come
to trust us, as we have her.

08:32.100 --> 08:37.070
She brought a great deal of love and
joy into our family and we just...

08:37.105 --> 08:39.173
we feel she deserves a second chance.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.208
However...

08:42.243 --> 08:45.512
we are not prepared to bring her
back into our home at this time.

09:10.723 --> 09:12.590
Hey.

09:12.625 --> 09:13.625
You're Mariana, right?

09:13.659 --> 09:15.527
Yeah.

09:15.561 --> 09:18.296
- Can I sit?
- Um, sure.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.297
Cool.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.534
I'm Chase.

09:22.568 --> 09:26.671
I'm Mariana... oh...
you... you're a senior.

09:26.706 --> 09:28.440
That's true.

09:28.474 --> 09:29.574
How do you know who I am?

09:29.608 --> 09:32.277
You helped hang posters
for the last school play.

09:32.311 --> 09:35.513
Check it out. Were doing
the Glass Menagerie next,

09:35.548 --> 09:37.315
and we need people to help crew.

09:38.751 --> 09:41.453
And, you like, remembered me?

09:41.487 --> 09:42.721
You made an impression.

09:42.755 --> 09:46.725
So, if you're interested, we're
having a meeting after school.

09:46.759 --> 09:47.726
It'd be cool to see you there.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.479
"Where have you been all this time?"

09:57.513 --> 09:59.247
"I have been to the movies."

09:59.281 --> 10:02.217
"All this time at the movies?"

10:02.251 --> 10:04.252
"There was a very long program..."

10:04.286 --> 10:06.521
We don't need to do this speech.

10:06.555 --> 10:09.224
Ok. "Tom, shhh!"

10:17.366 --> 10:18.533
We have to break up.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.371
I'm pretty sure that's
not a line in the play.

10:25.307 --> 10:26.474
I'm so sorry, Talya.

10:29.445 --> 10:30.545
We...

10:33.516 --> 10:35.550
I should have never gotten back with you.

10:36.652 --> 10:38.520
Then why did you?

10:41.424 --> 10:43.291
I don't know.

10:43.325 --> 10:47.228
I really care about you, ok, I really do...

10:47.263 --> 10:48.229
but...

10:48.264 --> 10:49.497
You don't love me.

10:53.302 --> 10:57.539
So, honestly this time...
is it because of Callie?

10:58.574 --> 10:59.641
Talya...

10:59.675 --> 11:03.211
Just... I just need to hear you admit it.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.379
So I know I'm not crazy.

11:07.450 --> 11:08.550
Yes. It's Callie.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.353
- Brandon.
- What?

11:13.289 --> 11:15.323
She's just going to hurt you.

11:21.397 --> 11:24.265
You... you don't know...

11:24.300 --> 11:25.567
- I don't.
- ... Everything.

11:38.481 --> 11:41.583
Sending Chase out with flyers
was obviously the right strategy.

11:42.718 --> 11:46.554
Of course, not a lot of boys showed up.

11:46.589 --> 11:50.692
But that's ok. Girls
work harder. Except me.

11:50.726 --> 11:54.562
I'm the lighting designer, which is kind
of a big deal since I'm only a freshman.

11:55.431 --> 11:56.531
Oh, but I'm fifteen.

11:56.565 --> 12:00.602
My parents held me back a year
so I'd be better at sports.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.504
Definitely not the right strategy.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.307
Uh... I'm Zac by the way.

12:06.342 --> 12:07.475
Mariana.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.310
All right, let's get started.

12:10.446 --> 12:12.547
First, thanks for representing.

12:12.581 --> 12:14.616
It's awesome to see so much
interest in the school play.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.618
Yeah, right. The play.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.354
Now, we need to fill a
lot of crew positions,

12:19.388 --> 12:21.623
but, one the most important, is costumes.

12:21.657 --> 12:25.360
Otherwise, we're going to
be like, on stage naked.

12:27.463 --> 12:28.418
But seriously,

12:28.819 --> 12:31.687
the costume designer helps
us create our characters.

12:32.434 --> 12:34.269
It's a totes collaborative thing.

12:34.303 --> 12:35.470
"Totes?"

12:36.705 --> 12:38.206
Mariana.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.375
And... Kelsey.

12:41.544 --> 12:44.579
Don't feel too bad, he
knows everyone's name.

12:44.613 --> 12:46.447
I mean, except, mine.

12:46.482 --> 12:50.351
I have an idea, it's a big job so,
why don't the two of you work together?

12:57.259 --> 13:00.161
So, there's this hot new vintage
store downtown. I was thinking...

13:00.196 --> 13:02.163
I can't do costumes with you.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.531
But, I thought we made up at Wyatt's party?

13:03.566 --> 13:05.567
You lied. You put the blame on Callie.

13:05.601 --> 13:07.168
I was covering your ass.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.503
Look, everybody knows I went to rehab.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.505
But what they don't know
is that you were my dealer.

13:12.575 --> 13:14.542
Do you know why?

13:14.577 --> 13:17.579
Because I kept that a secret...
because I thought you were my friend.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.215
I guess I was wrong.

13:24.286 --> 13:25.520
Are they here?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.622
Inside. Hey, wanna give me a hand...

13:29.291 --> 13:30.658
- I'll help.
- Great.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.493
You gotta beat me at a game of 21 first.

13:32.528 --> 13:34.262
All right.

13:36.432 --> 13:37.398
You're on.

13:37.433 --> 13:39.300
Age before beauty.

13:52.648 --> 13:53.648
Too easy.

13:55.618 --> 13:56.584
Hey.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.420
- Is she here?
- No.

13:59.455 --> 14:01.456
Well, what did the judge
say? When is she coming home?

14:01.490 --> 14:03.157
Sit. Let's talk.

14:06.362 --> 14:07.428
Callie's not coming home.

14:07.463 --> 14:09.447
- Forever?
- No, but not...

14:09.453 --> 14:12.321
Not until we've all had time
to figure out how this can work.

14:12.355 --> 14:14.323
With the two of you under the same roof.

14:14.357 --> 14:16.158
- I'll go live with dad then.
- That's not an option.

14:16.193 --> 14:18.127
Why not?

14:18.161 --> 14:19.995
Callie has bigger issues to deal with.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.131
She makes reckless decisions, Brandon.

14:22.165 --> 14:25.267
Whenever she feels out
of control or confused...

14:25.302 --> 14:27.103
She needs to learn coping skills.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.237
So she's going to learn them in juvie?

14:28.271 --> 14:30.172
Judge agreed to send her to a group home.

14:30.207 --> 14:32.374
What?

14:32.409 --> 14:35.111
Once you're in a group home
you're considered like high risk.

14:35.145 --> 14:37.246
She told me. No one
will ever want her again.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.014
We still want her.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.083
Well, that's not what she's gonna think.

14:41.118 --> 14:42.451
She's gonna think you're giving up on her.

14:42.486 --> 14:44.153
Like you're throwing her to the wolves.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.255
Well, we hope that eventually
she'll see we're doing this

14:46.289 --> 14:48.424
because we don't want to give up on her.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.059
And because we love her.

14:50.093 --> 14:52.094
So, what is this like "tough love" then?

14:52.129 --> 14:53.429
You know how this is gonna feel to Callie?

14:53.463 --> 14:56.098
After all she's been through? Like no love.

14:58.301 --> 15:00.035
- I want to see her.
- No.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.271
- Not right now.
- Why not?

15:02.305 --> 15:05.074
Because you and Callie need
a little time and space to...

15:05.108 --> 15:06.342
What? To get over each other?

15:06.376 --> 15:09.078
Well, that's not gonna
happen. Ok? We're in love.

15:09.112 --> 15:11.313
And keeping us apart, it's
not gonna to change that.

15:29.432 --> 15:31.267
How long do I have to be here?

15:31.301 --> 15:33.435
Until the judge is convinced
you won't run away again.

15:33.470 --> 15:36.338
This is a safe place.

15:39.409 --> 15:43.212
Hey, Ed. Hi, Callie, I'm Rita.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.381
Welcome to Girls United. Come on in.

15:49.419 --> 15:52.154
I'll show you to your room
after you meet all the girls.

15:52.189 --> 15:55.090
There are seven girls
who live here full-time.

15:55.125 --> 15:59.128
Actually one just went home yesterday,
so, your timing was kind of perfect.

15:59.162 --> 16:02.198
We appreciate you taking
Callie on such short notice.

16:02.232 --> 16:04.200
Your foster moms worked
very hard to get you in here.

16:05.335 --> 16:08.037
- Do I have to share a room?
- Yes, you will.

16:08.071 --> 16:12.074
Why are there no bars or security gates?

16:12.108 --> 16:13.075
How do you lock us in?

16:13.109 --> 16:14.243
We don't.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.212
We trust that you won't leave the premises.

16:16.246 --> 16:19.448
But, if you violate that trust,
then... you go back to juvie.

16:19.482 --> 16:22.084
Or you're placed in a more
restrictive group home.

16:22.152 --> 16:23.452
The choice is really yours.

16:24.487 --> 16:27.156
Hey, girls. Come meet Callie.

16:48.526 --> 16:49.998
Ok, ladies, you know how this works.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.345
We're gonna go around the room,
tell a little about yourself.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.381
Your age, where you're from,
how long you've been here,

16:55.415 --> 16:57.083
why you're here.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.351
All right, we're gonna
start with you, Kiara,

16:58.385 --> 17:01.120
since you're Callie's roommate
and you'll be her sponsor.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.255
Why don't you start us off.

17:02.289 --> 17:05.223
Ok. Hi. I'm Kiara. I'm fifteen.

17:05.259 --> 17:11.163
I've been in juvie, like,
three times? No, four.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.398
The first time I got arrested was
for throwin' bricks at a building

17:13.433 --> 17:15.067
when I was like eleven,

17:15.102 --> 17:17.369
and then for gang stuff you know,

17:17.404 --> 17:20.406
possessing and selling drugs,
assault with a deadly weapon.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.409
But that was like, not my
fault, anyway. That's me.

17:25.012 --> 17:27.146
I'm Becka, I'm sixteen...

17:27.180 --> 17:28.414
Oh, and I been here two months.

17:30.284 --> 17:32.318
And I'm always interrupting.

17:32.352 --> 17:37.290
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah, so, Kiara's been interrupting me

17:37.357 --> 17:38.357
the four weeks I've been here.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.459
Becka. Feet.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.099
I'm in for drugs.

17:47.134 --> 17:51.003
Using and selling. And
I, like, punched a cop.

17:51.038 --> 17:53.039
I was shooting drugs in
my neck before I came here.

17:53.073 --> 17:57.076
So, if I wasn't here,
I'd probably be dead now.

17:59.980 --> 18:04.350
I'm Carmen, I'm 17, I
wanna join the army...

18:06.019 --> 18:07.420
are we suppose to say what we wanna be?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.989
That's ok, honey, keep going.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.425
So, like I been in this
home for six months.

18:12.459 --> 18:17.964
In juvie three times for gangs, drugs...

18:17.998 --> 18:20.099
um, what else...

18:20.133 --> 18:22.101
- Kidnapping.
- Yeah.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.070
- Really?
- She asked.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.139
Ok. Zip it. Cole, you're up.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.209
My name is Cole. I'm 15.
I've been here 3 weeks.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.145
I hate it. What else?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.213
Why are you here?

18:34.247 --> 18:36.182
Stealing and prostitution.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.050
Thank you for sharing.

18:38.085 --> 18:40.086
Daphne, you're up.

18:40.120 --> 18:45.424
I'm Daphne, 17, been
here for about six weeks.

18:45.459 --> 18:50.262
In for gangs, drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.853
Oh, and just so you know, Callie,

18:51.854 --> 18:54.204
we have a zero tolerance
policy for violence.

18:54.211 --> 18:56.069
If you put your hands on anyone else

18:56.070 --> 18:58.368
you'll be asked to leave.
No exceptions, all right?

19:00.107 --> 19:02.975
I'm Gabi, I'm fifteen.
I've been here a month.

19:03.010 --> 19:07.046
I'm in for home invasion,
robbery, and cyber bullying.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.148
So, now you know a
little bit about everyone,

19:09.182 --> 19:16.054
why don't you tell us
a little bit about you.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.290
I stole a sandwich.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.192
I don't belong here.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.028
Anyone else feel they don't belong here?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.367
Ok.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.468
Happy to have you, Callie.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.275
Jude.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.012
I really thought that...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.383
I had no idea that they'd do this.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.019
Ok?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.290
I'm sorry.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.456
Let's go.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.159
Dinner's ready. Mama said to ask Mike.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.260
Really?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.496
Traveling!

20:31.531 --> 20:33.465
- What?
- Ah, it was so traveling!

20:33.499 --> 20:36.068
- It's Jesus' ball.
- No way!

20:38.204 --> 20:39.438
How was school, young lady?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.340
Anything new and exciting?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.342
I'm doing costumes for the school play.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.210
You are? That's a big undertaking.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.245
You can handle that?

20:46.279 --> 20:49.348
Well, if it's only a four character play.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.116
Well, good for you, I'm very proud of you.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.321
You ok, babe?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.456
What's wrong, baby?

20:57.490 --> 21:00.292
Jesus? Jesus, what's going on?

21:00.326 --> 21:02.060
What is going on?

21:02.095 --> 21:04.029
Mariana, go get Lena.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.330
Jesus. Jesus. Relax, relax.

21:05.365 --> 21:09.034
Shh. Slow. Slow breaths.

21:12.709 --> 21:15.945
I'm fine. I probably just
got, like, dehydrated.

21:15.979 --> 21:20.649
So, Dr. Levinson thinks it's just a short
term side-effect from upping his meds.

21:20.684 --> 21:22.818
So, what's in his meds that
would make his heart race?

21:22.853 --> 21:24.520
Well, they're stimulants, Mike.

21:24.554 --> 21:27.623
In kids with ADHD it actually help
them to calm down and to focus.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.759
And there's no other way to
treat it without medication?

21:29.793 --> 21:32.661
There is behavioral modification.

21:32.729 --> 21:34.063
It's controversial, Mike.

21:34.097 --> 21:36.665
And, it's not like we haven't
talked about it a thousand times.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.634
Well, not with me.

21:38.668 --> 21:39.969
I don't wanna take this stuff.

21:40.003 --> 21:42.671
If I can get off it, don't I get a say?

21:42.706 --> 21:44.974
Jesus, remember when you went
off the pills for those few days?

21:45.008 --> 21:46.709
You got really aggressive.

21:46.743 --> 21:48.811
And you were bouncing off
the walls too, dude, remember?

21:48.845 --> 21:50.946
I mean, come on, I was bouncing
off the walls when I was his age.

21:52.048 --> 21:53.849
What about getting into a contact sport?

21:53.884 --> 21:54.850
I mean, it helped me.

21:54.885 --> 21:56.752
Like football, no, no way.

21:56.820 --> 22:00.689
- No, like wrestling.
- No way. I'm not groping dudes.

22:00.724 --> 22:02.858
It's not groping.

22:02.893 --> 22:05.795
It's using strategic moves
to take down your opponent.

22:05.829 --> 22:09.532
It's physical, gets the aggression
out, teaches you mental focus.

22:09.566 --> 22:10.800
I mean, that's what he needs, right?

22:13.737 --> 22:14.870
Can I at least try it?

22:16.006 --> 22:17.773
Lena?

22:19.709 --> 22:22.978
- Ok?
- Ok.

22:23.013 --> 22:26.916
But, Jesus, you need to
be extremely disciplined.

22:26.950 --> 22:30.586
- Very.
- I will be.

22:32.823 --> 22:34.590
Do I have to wear a unitard?

22:34.624 --> 22:37.960
Ok, rule number one. Never,
ever call it a unitard.

22:37.994 --> 22:39.528
It's called a singlet.

22:40.997 --> 22:43.599
Uh... yeah, this needs a touch up.

22:43.633 --> 22:44.834
Why?

22:44.868 --> 22:46.669
It's sticky, you gotta wipe it again.

22:46.703 --> 22:48.003
Looks clean to me.

22:48.038 --> 22:50.773
Well, I'm kitchen foreman and if
you don't do your job, I get a UA.

22:50.807 --> 22:52.775
Cut the newbie a break, Nicole.

22:52.809 --> 22:53.976
That's not my name.

22:54.010 --> 22:56.745
Really? 'Cause it says
on your birth certificate.

22:56.780 --> 22:58.747
But, then it also says you're a girl.

22:58.782 --> 23:02.518
I'm a transgender male. Look it up, bitch.

23:02.552 --> 23:04.520
Ooh, who's gettin' a UA now.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.489
Why you gotta be like that?

23:06.523 --> 23:07.690
It's not Cole's fault he
was born in the wrong body.

23:07.724 --> 23:08.757
Look, you all trippin'.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.960
Let's just do our jobs
without no drama for once?

23:13.530 --> 23:15.531
- We all done in here?
- Yeah, so done.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.800
All right, yeah, looks good.

23:17.834 --> 23:20.836
Hey, Daphne, show Callie
where the trash is.

23:20.871 --> 23:21.904
- I'm lookin' at it.
- Oh, snap.

23:22.973 --> 23:24.640
Chill out, everybody.

23:25.609 --> 23:26.575
Let's go.

23:31.014 --> 23:34.917
Most of the food waste we
compost for the community garden,

23:34.951 --> 23:37.987
blue's for bottles and
cans only, green's for...

23:38.021 --> 23:41.790
Green waste. Yep. It's not my
first time taking out the trash.

23:43.593 --> 23:46.962
- You know me, right?
- Yeah. I know you.

23:46.997 --> 23:48.864
Why? You wanna take
another crack at my face?

23:48.899 --> 23:50.383
Look, I put hands on you, in juvie,

23:50.384 --> 23:51.971
and I'm sorry about that.

23:52.869 --> 23:54.703
I'm doin' real good here.

23:54.738 --> 23:57.606
I got my privileges, and if I keep
tight, I'll be out in two weeks.

23:58.842 --> 24:00.609
So. We straight?

24:03.713 --> 24:04.880
No, we're not straight.

24:15.759 --> 24:16.926
Hey.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.594
How about you knock?

24:18.628 --> 24:19.695
How about you check the attitude?

24:19.729 --> 24:20.696
Move over.

24:25.769 --> 24:29.838
So, mom and Lena told me about Callie.

24:29.873 --> 24:31.974
Ok, dad, I'm not really in
the mood for another lecture.

24:32.008 --> 24:33.642
I'm not in the mood to give one.

24:35.712 --> 24:36.912
Look, I understand.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.984
She's not your sister.

24:42.018 --> 24:43.786
Yet.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.588
You two have been through a
lot together. She's pretty.

24:45.622 --> 24:46.589
I get it.

24:46.623 --> 24:48.657
It's more than that.

24:48.692 --> 24:51.560
I know, Brandon. But,
you'll get over it. Trust me.

24:51.595 --> 24:54.597
If you're talking about mom, no offense,
but you didn't really have a choice.

24:55.699 --> 24:56.665
Look, Brandon.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.733
Callie didn't just run away,

24:57.767 --> 25:00.469
she ran away with a guy.
A guy she'd been dating.

25:00.503 --> 25:01.837
For all you know, that was
part of the plan all along.

25:01.871 --> 25:03.639
- It wasn't.
- Really?

25:03.673 --> 25:05.507
Has she reached out to you? At all?

25:07.777 --> 25:11.847
Mom and Lena told me,
Wyatt wasn't just a ride.

25:11.881 --> 25:14.750
She was planning to go all the
way to Indiana to live with him.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.719
No. Why are you telling me this?

25:19.522 --> 25:20.689
Because you need to hear it.

25:27.631 --> 25:28.797
What's a UA?

25:28.832 --> 25:30.666
It's a "unacceptable."

25:30.700 --> 25:34.570
For like not doing your jobs or
gettin' into it with the other girls.

25:34.604 --> 25:38.707
If you get five you get a
consequence, like an extra job.

25:38.742 --> 25:40.509
This is worse than juvie.

25:40.543 --> 25:44.613
Yeah, they're hard on you here, but
it's better than other homes I been in.

25:44.648 --> 25:48.651
Like this one I broke this girl's nose,

25:48.685 --> 25:49.952
I mean, like, I didn't mean to.

25:49.986 --> 25:52.521
She was on the ground
and I was kicking her,

25:52.555 --> 25:54.690
but like the staff didn't even care.

25:54.724 --> 25:56.725
At least here they care about you.

25:56.760 --> 26:01.664
Um... so other than school,
do we ever get out of here?

26:01.698 --> 26:03.599
Yeah, sometimes we go on field trips,

26:03.633 --> 26:05.801
and every once in a while
we get to go to the mall.

26:06.803 --> 26:07.936
Saturday's family day.

26:07.971 --> 26:10.873
If you got your privileges,
you can have visitors.

26:12.509 --> 26:14.743
Your mom or dad around?

26:14.778 --> 26:16.879
No, I'm in foster care with my brother.

26:18.515 --> 26:19.481
I have a brother.

26:20.917 --> 26:21.884
That's him.

26:23.987 --> 26:25.654
Does he ever come visit you?

26:25.689 --> 26:28.824
Nah. I don't know when
I'll get to see him again.

26:28.858 --> 26:30.659
He just got twenty-five to life.

26:30.694 --> 26:32.961
Hey, girls?

26:32.996 --> 26:35.564
How ya doin' K? You settling in ok, Callie?

26:35.598 --> 26:36.799
Yeah.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.635
Ok, listen, I know the first
night can be a little bit rough.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.503
So, we got Michelle downstairs,

26:41.538 --> 26:43.872
if you need anything,
just get a hold of her, ok?

26:43.907 --> 26:45.708
How do I get my privileges?

26:45.742 --> 26:46.975
The girls in the house vote on that.

26:50.847 --> 26:54.516
Yeah... um... so, like what's your job?

26:55.885 --> 27:00.489
My job? Mostly I'm here to
encourage peer accountability.

27:00.523 --> 27:03.759
Which in laymen's terms
means I'm the referee.

27:07.497 --> 27:08.897
Get some sleep. All right, ladies?

27:09.833 --> 27:11.533
Good night, K.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.812
Hey, you can't trust any of these girls

27:23.847 --> 27:25.714
with like underground stuff,

27:25.749 --> 27:27.916
but if you do your jobs
and you talk in group,

27:27.951 --> 27:30.519
they won't vote against you
gettin' to see your brother.

27:47.670 --> 27:49.705
Hey. You ok?

27:49.739 --> 27:53.509
Yeah. I just, needed an extra pillow.

27:53.543 --> 27:55.611
Well, I'm sure Callie wouldn't mind.

28:02.819 --> 28:05.821
So, it's kind of silly, but,

28:05.855 --> 28:09.591
I've been kind of scared
sleeping alone since Callie left.

28:10.727 --> 28:12.494
Do you...

28:12.529 --> 28:13.796
would you want sleep in here tonight?

28:16.933 --> 28:17.900
Sure.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.907
Oh, hey, what do you think?

28:38.577 --> 28:39.543
For Laura?

28:39.845 --> 28:41.645
No, for me.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.647
We're not shopping for ourselves.

28:44.716 --> 28:46.984
It's so boring shopping for other people.

28:56.528 --> 28:57.895
How hot would Chase look in this hat?

29:00.665 --> 29:02.933
Yeah, it's practically our whole budget.

29:02.968 --> 29:04.935
And we're shopping for Laura.

29:04.970 --> 29:08.639
Right. Laura. Which one is she again?

29:09.708 --> 29:10.941
Have you even read the play?

29:10.976 --> 29:14.845
Nah, I'm not into reading.
Like, what's her vibe?

29:16.581 --> 29:21.852
Um... insecure, crippled,
virgin, overbearing mother.

29:24.856 --> 29:26.724
Oooh... that could work.

29:26.758 --> 29:27.858
Yeah. Try it on.

29:27.893 --> 29:29.660
Why do I have to try it on?

29:29.694 --> 29:32.830
Come on, insecure, crippled, virgin...

29:32.864 --> 29:36.967
Just kidding. I didn't wear
any panties today, geez.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.583
So, I'm totes having sex
with Chase by opening night.

29:54.686 --> 29:57.655
Not that he's boyfriend material, but...

29:57.689 --> 29:58.989
you know, he's hot for a theater nerd.

29:59.024 --> 29:59.990
Don't you think?

30:02.928 --> 30:04.595
Yeah, I guess.

30:10.835 --> 30:12.937
One down, how many other characters to go?

30:12.971 --> 30:15.906
Three. You should really read the play.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.675
Isn't there like a movie version?

30:17.709 --> 30:19.610
I need to check your bags.

30:23.014 --> 30:24.682
Just the shopping bags and receipts.

30:30.021 --> 30:33.023
I don't know. I'm...

30:33.058 --> 30:36.794
I'm so tired. And sick of everything.

30:36.828 --> 30:40.597
Well, you've been through a
lot, Becka. I'd be tired too.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.932
Can someone else just talk?

30:41.967 --> 30:43.901
You gotta talk about it.

30:43.935 --> 30:46.937
Why? It sucks. I suck.

30:48.006 --> 30:49.673
I just wanna get high.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.709
You're gonna kill yourself with
dope because you can't deal?

30:51.743 --> 30:53.010
I don't wanna deal. Ok?

30:53.044 --> 30:55.646
I don't need to talk about
how my mom's boyfriends

30:55.680 --> 30:57.514
messed with me when I was just a kid.

30:57.549 --> 30:58.816
Because who cares?

30:59.985 --> 31:02.920
Where was your mom, she
shouldn't have let that happen.

31:02.954 --> 31:05.522
She was gettin' high.

31:05.557 --> 31:10.661
Look, I started smokin' dope
with my grandma when I was 11.

31:10.695 --> 31:13.731
The only person who ever cared
about me is my best friend,

31:13.765 --> 31:16.700
and she OD'd.

31:16.735 --> 31:17.835
I care about you.

31:20.638 --> 31:21.972
You know, Becky, you need some life goals.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.941
You know, honey, something
to look forward to.

31:23.975 --> 31:26.944
I mean, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

31:30.615 --> 31:31.648
Happy.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.818
Well, that is one great goal.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.588
Hey, how come you never share?

31:37.922 --> 31:39.023
What do you mean?

31:39.057 --> 31:41.825
Yeah, how old are you,
what drugs have you done,

31:41.860 --> 31:43.560
what's your addiction?

31:43.995 --> 31:45.763
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

31:45.797 --> 31:47.965
Ok. Um... I'm fifty years old.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.933
I knew you was old. Older than Michelle.

31:49.968 --> 31:52.736
No way!

31:52.771 --> 31:53.971
I thought you were like 30.

31:54.005 --> 31:55.839
Really? You are now my favorite.

31:55.874 --> 31:58.942
- As for you, Daphne, hmm...
- Just sayin'.

31:58.977 --> 32:01.845
No, I'm fifty, and for
drugs, not too much, you know?

32:01.880 --> 32:06.583
When I was young I smoked a little weed.

32:06.618 --> 32:08.852
And for like half a
second, I did some speed.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.554
- Speed?
- For real?

32:10.588 --> 32:12.623
- That's for real.
- How'd you stop?

32:12.657 --> 32:15.659
One day, I just decided that

32:15.693 --> 32:18.762
doing drugs wasn't gonna get me
where I wanted to go, so I quit.

32:18.797 --> 32:20.564
Now, listen, not everybody can do that.

32:20.598 --> 32:22.766
- You ain't no addict.
- I am an addict.

32:22.801 --> 32:24.802
I'm addicted to food.

32:24.836 --> 32:26.870
I've struggled with it my entire life.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.973
You know, everyone is
addicted to something.

32:30.008 --> 32:32.709
- Not me. I don't do drugs.
- No?

32:32.744 --> 32:34.645
You're addicted to boys!

32:34.679 --> 32:35.946
You don't ever shut up
about your boyfriends.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.915
I haven't talked to my
boyfriend since I've been here.

32:37.949 --> 32:40.784
Well, I haven't done meth since I been
here, but that's still my addiction.

32:40.819 --> 32:42.753
Why you always raggin' on me, Carmen?

32:44.722 --> 32:46.590
What about Cole?

32:46.624 --> 32:48.759
He's always sayin' he's
not addicted to nothin'.

32:48.793 --> 32:50.861
She's addicted to being a boy.

32:50.895 --> 32:52.596
Use the pronoun "he" please.

32:52.630 --> 32:53.797
I am a boy.

32:53.832 --> 32:56.834
And, you know what, I belong
in an LGBT home where...

32:56.868 --> 32:59.903
And I told you, I am working on that, ok?

32:59.938 --> 33:02.940
Be grateful you're here and not in
juvie gettin' your ass beat every day.

33:02.974 --> 33:04.875
You may be a boy but you ain't no butch.

33:04.909 --> 33:08.979
What about you? What's your addiction?

33:11.549 --> 33:14.651
I've never done drugs.

33:17.622 --> 33:19.890
I've had a couple beers.

33:19.924 --> 33:22.960
Well, Callie, your addiction
doesn't have to be drugs or alcohol.

33:24.762 --> 33:26.563
I really... don't know.

33:26.598 --> 33:28.832
Um...

33:28.867 --> 33:32.536
I feel like I have to tell you
that I'm addicted to something

33:32.570 --> 33:35.906
so that I can get my privileges.
But I'd just be making it up.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.875
Why'd you run away from your foster home?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.547
I kissed my foster brother.

33:44.949 --> 33:45.983
Oh, snap.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.653
La la la. Is he hot?

33:50.922 --> 33:53.957
So, you want your privileges
so you can see your boyfriend?

33:53.992 --> 33:56.593
No. I need to see my little brother.

34:01.766 --> 34:03.834
He needs to know why I left.

34:14.779 --> 34:18.681
So, Jude, I just got off the
phone with Rita at Girls United.

34:18.716 --> 34:22.719
Girls United is the group
home where Callie is,

34:22.754 --> 34:25.755
and she gets to have visitors
tomorrow for family day.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.891
I'm gonna get to see her?

34:27.926 --> 34:29.726
Yes, sir.

34:29.761 --> 34:30.827
Can we all come?

34:30.862 --> 34:32.829
You know, I think it best
if Jude doesn't have to

34:32.864 --> 34:35.799
share Callie just yet. Ok?

34:35.833 --> 34:38.635
Good night. The two of
you don't stay up too late.

34:38.670 --> 34:39.937
- Love you.
- Love you.

34:41.906 --> 34:42.940
Are you excited?

34:42.974 --> 34:45.842
Yeah. I mean, I can't believe it.

34:47.812 --> 34:49.012
You know what I can't believe?

34:49.047 --> 34:52.683
That I'm doing homework on Friday night.

34:52.717 --> 34:53.817
I'm so overwhelmed with the play.

34:53.851 --> 34:55.018
And, I have a book report due on Monday,

34:55.053 --> 34:56.853
and I haven't even started reading.

35:07.832 --> 35:09.833
Cool. Where'd you get it?

35:14.806 --> 35:17.541
- Can I borrow your lotion?
- On my shelf.

35:19.110 --> 35:21.487
So, you run out on your brother and

35:21.488 --> 35:23.235
you think that makes
you some kind of martyr?

35:23.681 --> 35:25.816
Group's over, Becka.

35:25.850 --> 35:30.554
You just turn on the water works
and you think you got us all fooled?

35:30.588 --> 35:31.722
Well, not me.

35:31.756 --> 35:34.591
You know what I think you are?

35:34.626 --> 35:36.026
A selfish bitch.

35:36.060 --> 35:40.764
Well, fortunately, I don't care
about the opinions of a drug addict.

35:51.576 --> 35:53.744
- Um... I'm sorry.
- Get out!

35:53.778 --> 35:54.745
Get out!

36:03.582 --> 36:04.565
All right, Callie,

36:04.569 --> 36:08.005
Why don't you go first. What happened?

36:08.040 --> 36:12.043
I accidentally walked in
on Cole in the bathroom.

36:12.077 --> 36:13.077
I heard yelling.

36:13.111 --> 36:14.145
I told her to get out.

36:14.179 --> 36:15.847
And then what happened?

36:15.914 --> 36:17.849
Nothing.

36:19.885 --> 36:20.918
Nothing?

36:22.120 --> 36:23.855
Cole?

36:23.889 --> 36:27.925
I slipped on some water and
fell back into the shower door.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.828
Wow. It was a pretty hard fall.

36:31.830 --> 36:32.897
Pretty wet floor.

36:34.099 --> 36:35.900
Mmm...

36:35.934 --> 36:37.134
Girls, anybody see anything?

36:40.739 --> 36:41.706
Nothing?

36:43.208 --> 36:44.976
Well, Callie, you know,
we do have a solution

36:45.010 --> 36:47.144
when two girls don't get
along here in this house.

36:48.013 --> 36:49.013
We make them roommates.

37:03.729 --> 37:05.096
I wasn't sure if you had to dress up.

37:07.032 --> 37:08.833
You look very handsome.

37:12.804 --> 37:13.804
What's wrong?

37:16.875 --> 37:19.744
Sweetheart, listen,

37:19.778 --> 37:23.814
it would seem that Callie
has lost her privileges.

37:23.849 --> 37:25.883
So, she's not allowed
to have visitors today.

37:25.918 --> 37:28.019
Why? What'd she do?

37:28.053 --> 37:29.120
We're not sure.

37:29.154 --> 37:31.756
But, there was some kind of an altercation

37:31.790 --> 37:33.724
with another girl last night,

37:33.759 --> 37:37.591
and Rita just thinks Callie
needs a little more time

37:37.592 --> 37:39.462
to think about why she's there.

37:42.768 --> 37:44.869
Hey, you know what?

37:44.903 --> 37:48.739
Brandon is at piano and
Mariana and Jesus are busy,

37:48.774 --> 37:50.841
so why don't the three of
us just do something fun?

37:50.876 --> 37:52.076
We could go to a movie?

37:52.110 --> 37:53.144
Yeah. Go biking?

37:53.178 --> 37:54.178
The aquarium?

37:55.981 --> 37:59.951
I... actually have a lot of homework.

37:59.985 --> 38:03.688
I think I just want to
stay here, if that's ok.

38:05.891 --> 38:07.058
Of course.

38:07.092 --> 38:08.059
Whatever you want, hon.

38:08.093 --> 38:09.760
Just let us know if you change your mind.

38:29.715 --> 38:30.815
Guess what I found in my backpack?

38:30.849 --> 38:33.751
Could it be a sexy, brown fedora?

38:33.785 --> 38:35.686
You could have gotten me
arrested for shoplifting!

38:35.721 --> 38:38.089
Yeah, but I didn't and now we
have an awesome hat for Chase.

38:38.123 --> 38:39.123
We're not keeping it.

38:39.157 --> 38:40.791
You snuck it out, you sneak it back in.

38:40.826 --> 38:41.859
Whoa, is that for me?

38:41.893 --> 38:44.895
- Yeah, it is.
- Sweet.

38:49.835 --> 38:50.835
You look really hot in that hat.

38:50.869 --> 38:53.871
Totes. Mariana, you're genius.

38:53.905 --> 38:55.006
Actually, I saw it first.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.009
But, I carried it out of the store.

38:58.043 --> 39:01.112
I mean, 'cause I thought it would
help you create your character.

39:01.146 --> 39:04.115
This hat is like the key to Jim.

39:04.149 --> 39:05.950
It's like flashy, but made of felt.

39:05.984 --> 39:06.984
You know what I mean?

39:07.019 --> 39:08.653
Totes.

39:08.687 --> 39:09.987
I got to go show this off.

39:11.123 --> 39:12.123
You're welcome.

39:15.861 --> 39:18.095
One! Two!

39:18.130 --> 39:21.098
Three! Four!

39:21.133 --> 39:24.835
Nicely done! Nicely done! Let's go whales!

39:24.870 --> 39:26.771
They let girls wrestle?

39:26.805 --> 39:28.739
Not in my day. So, what do you think?

39:29.174 --> 39:30.808
Doesn't seem that hard.

39:31.076 --> 39:32.043
Really?

39:33.078 --> 39:35.780
Jesus, you wanna come on in, give it a try?

39:35.814 --> 39:37.081
Just pop your shoes off for me, ok?

39:37.115 --> 39:39.917
Circle up, everybody. This is Jesus.

39:39.951 --> 39:42.853
We are going to teach Jesus
about a basic breakdown.

39:42.888 --> 39:45.122
That is a move that takes your
opponent off his or her base,

39:45.157 --> 39:47.692
and drops them straight to the mat. Ok?

39:47.726 --> 39:50.061
Emma, why don't you come
on in and take top position.

39:50.095 --> 39:51.929
We'll do a tight waist, far ankle.

39:53.165 --> 39:54.131
Ready?

40:06.044 --> 40:07.144
Nice effort.

40:09.881 --> 40:10.714
Hello?

40:10.715 --> 40:14.374
Cole, Callie, you're welcome to
join us downstairs for refreshments.

40:14.786 --> 40:15.886
No, thanks.

40:17.089 --> 40:18.189
Is there ice cream?

40:18.223 --> 40:21.859
I think so. And chocolate sauce.

40:21.893 --> 40:23.994
I'm pretty sure I saw some of that too.

40:24.029 --> 40:25.096
Yes.

40:28.900 --> 40:33.771
Hey, I'm really sorry you didn't
get to see your brother today.

40:33.805 --> 40:34.586
Really?

40:35.327 --> 40:37.975
Is that why you took away
my privileges for no reason?

40:39.177 --> 40:40.945
Callie.

40:40.979 --> 40:45.082
I didn't see what happened between
you and Cole, but I'm not stupid.

40:45.117 --> 40:49.053
You don't get to act out and then
run away from the consequences.

40:49.087 --> 40:52.223
Not in this house. In
fact, not anywhere in life.

40:54.025 --> 40:56.894
The sooner you learn that,
the better off you're gonna be.

40:57.963 --> 40:58.929
Is that it?

41:00.031 --> 41:01.999
That's it. And that's a lot.

41:02.033 --> 41:03.834
So, think it over, all right?

41:06.104 --> 41:07.872
I hope you come down and join us.
