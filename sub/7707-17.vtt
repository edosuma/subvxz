WEBVTT

00:15.950 --> 00:17.850
You missed a spot.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.522
ALF..

00:24.792 --> 00:27.793
...I'd like to hear
about it one more time.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.294
Don't torture yourself, Willie.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.363
- Please. Just once more.
- Don't!

00:31.365 --> 00:33.399
Why'd you flood the house?

00:33.401 --> 00:36.068
I wanted to make a skating rink.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.839
And how are you planning
to freeze the water?

00:40.841 --> 00:44.476
By turning
the air conditioner on high.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.247
I'd like to hear about it
one more time.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.381
Just one more, come on.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.583
This is not
a Bergman movie, Willie.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.053
It's fairly cut and dried.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.488
Water, air conditioner

00:56.490 --> 00:58.891
holiday on ice.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.028
Ah. I'm gonna go
for a little while.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.565
I'm gonna, uh, rent a pump
for the basement.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.634
Just tell me one more time,
just one more--

01:08.636 --> 01:11.336
Willie, go rent your pump.

01:11.338 --> 01:15.140
Now, I'm going to rent..

01:15.142 --> 01:16.842
...a pump!

01:19.213 --> 01:21.513
What was all that about?

01:21.515 --> 01:24.416
[telephone ringing]

01:24.418 --> 01:26.585
Your two dimes.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.320
(male #1)
'Gordon Shumway?'

01:28.322 --> 01:31.056
Speaking. Who's this?

01:31.058 --> 01:34.593
This is someone
who knows you're an alien.

01:36.797 --> 01:40.199
And if you don't pay me
$3000 by Friday

01:40.201 --> 01:43.302
I'm gonna turn you in
to the authorities.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.638
Ah, the number you have
reached is not in service.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.875
Please hang up and dial again.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.577
Don't get cute.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.845
I'll call you back
tomorrow morning

01:52.847 --> 01:55.481
with more details, pinhead.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.053
Oh. Okay.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.821
Don't panic.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.691
Willie will help you.
He always helps you.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.262
I'm dog food.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.131
[squealing]

02:13.434 --> 02:16.635
[theme music]

02:46.467 --> 02:49.668
[music continues]

03:15.196 --> 03:17.696
[instrumental music]

03:18.832 --> 03:20.666
Willie, have you noticed

03:20.668 --> 03:22.501
that ALF's been acting
strange lately?

03:22.503 --> 03:25.103
Yeah. It's going on
three years now.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.005
I mean, like last night
when he apologized

03:27.007 --> 03:29.541
for every bad thing
he's done since he got here.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.710
Alphabetically.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.680
[sighs]
I get lost between
drain cloggage

03:34.682 --> 03:37.182
and drywall damage.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.817
Well, I guess you missed
the part where he confessed

03:38.819 --> 03:41.687
to kidnapping
the Lindbergh baby.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.888
[knock on door]

03:42.890 --> 03:45.591
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanners, it's me!'

03:50.931 --> 03:53.865
- Morning.
- Good morning. I'll take it.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.269
- Take what?
- Your house.

03:57.271 --> 04:01.240
"House for sale, $4000."

04:01.242 --> 04:03.942
- You found that on our lawn?
- Yeah.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.011
I can let you have
100 bucks up front

04:06.013 --> 04:08.747
if you'll finance the rest.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.916
Well, that's very generous
of you, Trevor, but..

04:10.918 --> 04:13.118
[chuckles]
...I think there's been
a mistake.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.489
Okay, I'll let you have 4100
and your lawn mower back.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.425
But that's my final offer.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.161
No. I mean, uh,
we're not selling--

04:23.163 --> 04:27.299
Someone must've put that
on our lawn as a kind of prank.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.502
Oh, it's too bad.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.104
This place would've made
a nice summer home

04:32.106 --> 04:34.106
for me and Raquel.

04:39.546 --> 04:43.582
Captain's log, Stardate 2525.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.917
Man, I'm still alive.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.787
I'm now attempting to earn
the blackmail money

04:48.789 --> 04:51.356
by recycling soda cans.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.359
Oh, ALF!

04:54.361 --> 04:56.695
What are you doing?

04:56.697 --> 05:00.365
Tempting diabetes. You?

05:00.367 --> 05:04.069
Why did you drink
every can of soda in the house?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.571
Currently, I'm recycling cans.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.975
In a short while,
I'll be recycling soda.

05:11.045 --> 05:13.345
Let me have a crack at him.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.814
What's the meaning of this?

05:15.816 --> 05:19.384
I figured we could use
some extra cash.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.654
ALF, is there some reason other
than the extensive water damage

05:22.656 --> 05:24.656
why we should sell
our house as quickly

05:24.658 --> 05:27.826
and as inexpensively
as possible?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.295
I just thought
it would be a good idea.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.897
You never know when
you're gonna have to pay off

05:31.899 --> 05:34.733
some extortionist.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.235
[laughing]

05:37.237 --> 05:39.905
Okay, let-let me guess.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.007
You need money for some reason?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.675
- Good morning.
- Morning.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.945
- No. No, not so far.
- What's going on?

05:46.947 --> 05:50.215
We're in the process
of ascertaining that right now.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.118
I would've told you yesterday.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.354
But I was waiting
for the carpets to dry out

05:55.356 --> 05:56.988
and you to calm down.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.391
ALF, would've told us what?

05:59.393 --> 06:03.729
This hoodlum called
and put the squeeze on me.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.964
He says he knows I'm an alien

06:05.966 --> 06:08.800
and if I don't pay him $3000

06:08.802 --> 06:11.503
he'll turn me in!

06:11.505 --> 06:13.672
Woe is me.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.375
Woe is me.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.414
If you leave now, you could beat
the lines at the bank.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.983
Ask for small, unmarked bills

06:24.985 --> 06:28.420
that's standard
blackmailing procedure.

06:28.422 --> 06:32.924
ALF, you don't really expect us
to buy this story, do you?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.060
You don't believe me!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.763
I don't think it was
a blackmailer, ALF.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.166
I think it was probably
just a crank call.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.702
Did the voice sound familiar?

06:43.704 --> 06:46.204
Well, first I thought
it might be Kate

06:46.206 --> 06:48.473
but the voice
wasn't high enough.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.809
Then I thought
it might be Kate's mother

06:50.811 --> 06:53.211
but the voice
wasn't low enough.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.882
You suspected one of us?

06:56.884 --> 06:59.050
Well, you have the most to gain.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.919
- I cost you tons of money.
- Oh.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.555
You have no life of your own.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.590
Privacy is nil.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.692
And I'm shutting up now.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.162
- I didn't tell anyone.
- None of us did.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.464
And it wasn't my mother either.

07:12.466 --> 07:16.535
Well, I know that.
The voice wasn't snarly enough.

07:16.537 --> 07:20.505
Wasn't nasty and vile enough.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.507
Don't push it.

07:26.079 --> 07:30.348
Did the extortionist
say anything else?

07:30.350 --> 07:34.186
Yeah, he said he'd call me back
later this morning, pinhead.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.989
I beg your pardon?

07:37.991 --> 07:40.058
That's what he called me.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.728
I would never
call you a pinhead.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.931
Not to your face.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.266
Wait.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.102
If this blackmailer
asked you for $3000

07:51.104 --> 07:53.672
why were you selling
our house for 4000?

07:53.674 --> 07:57.309
I figured you guys should get
something out of it.

07:57.311 --> 08:01.580
I can help. I have ten dollars
and 32 cents in my piggy bank.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.815
No, you don't.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.351
We'll talk about it later.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.354
[instrumental music]

08:12.326 --> 08:14.326
[telephone rings]

08:16.129 --> 08:18.930
(ALF on recorder)
'Hi, this is Gordon Shumway.'

08:18.932 --> 08:22.267
'I'm dead right now,
please leave your name, address'

08:22.269 --> 08:24.202
'and extortion demands
at the beep.'

08:24.204 --> 08:26.705
'And I'll get back to you
probably never.'

08:26.707 --> 08:29.674
'As I said, I'm dead.'

08:29.676 --> 08:32.377
(Willie on phone)
'ALF, pick up the phone.'

08:35.716 --> 08:39.084
ALF, if you're there, answer.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.221
- Willie?
- 'Yeah.'

08:43.223 --> 08:46.224
Oh-oh. Oh, hold on. Hold on.
Let me turn this off.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.961
What-what are you doing?

08:49.963 --> 08:53.131
I'm trying to trace
all incoming phone calls.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.234
And I'm also
eating potato chips.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.470
Stop fooling around
with the phone, will you?

08:58.472 --> 09:01.907
Uh, tell Kate
that I'll be late for supper.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.175
Oh, sure. Don't worry about me.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.444
I'm only the blackmailee.

09:08.348 --> 09:12.517
Did the alleged man
call you back yet?

09:12.519 --> 09:14.553
Well, not exactly.

09:14.555 --> 09:18.857
Then it doesn't seem to me
that you're being blackmailed.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.293
- Oh, and, ALF.
- Yeah?

09:21.295 --> 09:24.930
- 'Change the message.'
- Okay, bye.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.472
Hello?
This is the Tanner residence.

09:34.474 --> 09:38.410
If you called to terrorize
anyone here you're too late.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.145
So why don't you just
shrivel up and die

09:40.147 --> 09:43.315
you scummy pile
of meatloaf slag.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.550
Please wait for the beep.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.553
[instrumental music]

09:54.261 --> 09:56.328
- Hi, ALF.
- Aah!

09:58.665 --> 10:00.765
Sorry.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.369
I saw your light on.
You can't sleep?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.104
How do you expect me to sleep?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.074
In 24 hours, I'm gonna
be hamburger helper.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.445
Would you stop
the ground meat metaphors?

10:13.447 --> 10:16.481
Nobody's gonna turn you in
to the authorities.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.817
You don't believe me either,
do you, Lynn?

10:18.819 --> 10:21.186
Tsk. It's not that
I don't believe you.

10:21.188 --> 10:25.590
It's just that you have
a tendency to...overstate.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.159
Do not, do not, do not.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.030
Look, you said this guy was
going to call you back

10:32.032 --> 10:34.132
this morning. Did he?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.634
- No.
- No.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.535
A-and you said he told you
something terrible

10:37.537 --> 10:40.438
was gonna happen
if you didn't pay him off.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.674
- Did it?
- Well, no.

10:42.676 --> 10:46.011
See, you were all worried
for nothing.

10:47.447 --> 10:51.449
You know, if mom and dad really
thought you were in danger

10:51.451 --> 10:53.752
they'd do something about it.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.823
So why don't you just
get some sleep, okay?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.359
Okay. I'll see you
in the morning.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.496
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Night, Lynn.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.668
Don't worry about me.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.304
If you need me,
I'll be up here overreacting.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.508
[telephone ringing]

11:20.514 --> 11:24.249
- Hello?
- 'Gordon Shumway?'

11:24.251 --> 11:28.653
- Yes.
- You got the money?

11:28.655 --> 11:30.221
Um, oh, I'm working on it.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.757
Who should I make
the check out to?

11:32.759 --> 11:35.427
Nice try, pinhead.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.195
But you better come up
with the cash

11:37.197 --> 11:40.799
or it's too bad
about the Tanners.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.635
'They're gonna be in a lot of
trouble for keeping you.'

11:43.637 --> 11:46.538
But I guess a little jail time
never hurt anyone.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.940
[laughing]

11:48.942 --> 11:50.809
[dial tone]

11:53.280 --> 11:55.980
When the going gets tough

11:55.982 --> 11:58.183
the tough get going.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.219
And so do I.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.222
[instrumental music]

12:05.258 --> 12:07.358
[pounding on door]

12:10.864 --> 12:13.531
- Just a minute!
- I don't like this, Willie.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.867
Even Trevor doesn't
come over this late.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.836
Just...just wait here.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.270
[pounding continues]

12:19.272 --> 12:22.073
- Who is it?
- 'Immigration.'

12:30.083 --> 12:31.850
- Are you William Tanner?
- Yes.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.486
I'm Lee Frazer
with Immigration Service.

12:34.488 --> 12:37.422
We've been informed that
you're keeping an alien here.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.491
- What?
- Yes, sir.

12:39.493 --> 12:44.596
- An undocumented resident.
- Oh, Willie!

12:44.598 --> 12:47.766
I think they mean
an illegal alien.

12:47.768 --> 12:51.970
Right. It's illegal for us
to arrest legal aliens.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.638
[Kate laughing]

12:53.640 --> 12:57.609
Well, there are no aliens,
illegal or otherwise here.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.410
Mind if we check?

12:59.412 --> 13:02.247
Well, do you mind
if I see a search warrant?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.250
[groans]

13:07.420 --> 13:10.255
- What's going on?
- Are we busted?

13:10.257 --> 13:13.758
- No.
- Maybe.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.495
Uh, they're-they're looking
for illegal aliens!

13:19.032 --> 13:20.632
Human illegal aliens!

13:20.634 --> 13:23.735
Who may be hiding somewhere
in our house!

13:25.806 --> 13:27.505
You have a basement or attic?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.275
Well, w-we just
fumigated the attic.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.011
The fumes are,
ha, ha, really bad.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.380
We could get you a fan if you
really need to go up there.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.183
Thanks. That won't be necessary.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.552
He's in the attic.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.788
Where is it?

13:50.764 --> 13:53.832
What are we going to do?
They're gonna find ALF!

13:53.834 --> 13:56.734
- We've got to warn him.
- How can, how can we warn him?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.603
There's only one way
up to the attic.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.674
- What's this?
- Looks like a note from ALF.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.576
A note from ALF.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.711
"Dear family,
my imaginary blackmailer

14:06.713 --> 14:08.847
"called again tonight
and threatened to send you all

14:08.849 --> 14:12.584
"to the imaginary slammer
if I don't pay up.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.353
"I would rather be
turned into cream chip beef

14:15.355 --> 14:18.923
"than to see you go to jail
because of me.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.359
"You're welcome.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.962
"Anyway, I had to take..

14:24.731 --> 14:26.431
...the car."

14:29.236 --> 14:31.536
"Tell Willie to calm down.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.273
"I'll leave the car
on Highway 71

14:35.275 --> 14:37.609
"just outside
Edwards Air Force Base.

14:37.611 --> 14:40.845
Don't worry,
nobody will want to steal it."

14:41.648 --> 14:43.715
ALF's joining the air force?

14:43.717 --> 14:46.951
That's where
the Alien Task Force is.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.387
He took the car.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.259
[instrumental music]

14:56.696 --> 15:01.432
Oh, greetings,
members of the Alien Task Force

15:01.434 --> 15:03.635
please don't kill me.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.438
Too on the nose. Oh.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.208
Dear Alien Task Force members

15:10.210 --> 15:13.077
uh, spare my life
and I can offer you

15:13.079 --> 15:15.713
untold technological secrets.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.416
Like how to program your VCR.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.254
Alright, how about this?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.756
Alright, look, you guys

15:24.758 --> 15:28.226
before you dissect me
I'd like to say one thing..

15:28.228 --> 15:29.894
...don't!

15:29.896 --> 15:32.764
Better, better.
Honesty is the best policy.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.669
[instrumental music]

15:40.473 --> 15:43.942
Who lives...in the attic?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.212
Nobody.

15:48.214 --> 15:51.983
We just found the remnants
of about 50 TV dinners up there.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.619
Care to comment?

15:55.922 --> 15:59.023
We hoard. Don't we, dear?

15:59.025 --> 16:01.459
Hmm? We're hoarders.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.997
What made you think
we had an illegal alien?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.599
His name turned up
on a mailing list.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.601
Our computers red-flagged it
when they couldn't match it

16:10.603 --> 16:12.870
to a Social Security number.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.739
But who brought this
to your attention?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.709
What difference does
that make, pinhead?

16:19.012 --> 16:21.879
So...where is he?

16:24.050 --> 16:28.619
Look...I can make a lotta
trouble for you.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.558
Since you didn't find anyone
I'm gonna have to ask you

16:33.560 --> 16:36.961
and Darryl and Darryl to leave.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.598
This isn't over.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.304
Pinhead,
isn't that what ALF said

16:46.306 --> 16:47.405
the blackmailer called him?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.475
Yes. Yes,
it's getting very clear.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.610
ALF really was
being blackmailed.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.747
Oh, honey, the poor little guy
must be terrified.

16:55.749 --> 16:58.416
Dad, what if something
happens to him?

16:58.418 --> 17:02.487
And I yelled at him for taking
my ten dollars and 32 cents.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.023
- Okay, let's go.
- Well, wait, wait!

17:05.025 --> 17:06.991
We have no car.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.694
I know even I don't
usually come over this late

17:09.696 --> 17:13.798
but I heard the commotion.
Who are the suits?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.934
Oh, just a couple of gentlemen
from immigration.

17:16.936 --> 17:20.071
- Oh, I understand.
- No, you don't.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.806
My cousin's a lawyer.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.274
Call this number

17:23.276 --> 17:26.744
and ask for an inmate 2-4-6-0-1.

17:27.881 --> 17:31.883
- Trevor, can we borrow the car?
- Again?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.185
What's wrong
with yours this time?

17:34.187 --> 17:35.753
What was the reason before?

17:35.755 --> 17:39.190
Somebody filled your gas tank
with malted milk balls.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.626
Same problem. Thanks.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.196
Hey, Willie, don't worry!

17:45.198 --> 17:48.900
This immigration thing will
be our own little secret!

17:50.036 --> 17:53.037
[instrumental music]

18:01.147 --> 18:04.115
[door creaking]

18:04.117 --> 18:06.150
Hello?

18:06.152 --> 18:08.119
Anyone in here?

18:09.022 --> 18:11.089
I, uh..

18:11.091 --> 18:15.159
...I ran out of gas
just down the road.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.095
Hello?

18:17.864 --> 18:19.464
[sniffs]

18:19.466 --> 18:22.166
Interesting aroma.

18:22.168 --> 18:25.403
Oh, hey, I don't suppose
you have a key to the house.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.071
I need to use the phone.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.407
[mooing]

18:29.409 --> 18:30.942
Sorry.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.580
Well, I guess
I can relate to you.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.516
We're all prisoners
in one way or another.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.420
But must it be so?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.789
I cannot change my own destiny.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.625
Maybe I could change yours.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.527
Go!

18:49.529 --> 18:51.395
Get along, little doggie.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.599
- Yee-Haw!
- ALF!

18:54.601 --> 18:57.368
Willie, how did you find me?

18:57.370 --> 19:00.972
I saw the car parked down
by the side of the road.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.742
I followed the empty
candy wrappers here.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.878
Well, I was gonna pick them up
on my way back.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.314
They were to help me
find the car.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.316
What happened?

19:12.318 --> 19:15.620
You neglected to fill the tank.

19:15.622 --> 19:19.357
ALF, you don't have to
turn yourself in.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.958
I must. I must.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.762
No, no.
I know who's blackmailing you.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.398
And he doesn't think
you're an alien alien

19:27.400 --> 19:31.202
he thinks that you're
an illegal alien.

19:31.204 --> 19:35.373
You mean I almost turned myself
in because of semantics?

19:35.375 --> 19:39.810
I almost turned myself in
because of semantics!

19:41.181 --> 19:44.015
ALF, uh, why did you..

19:44.017 --> 19:47.652
Why didn't you come to me before
you did something this drastic?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.153
I did come to you.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.123
If you'll recall,
you didn't believe me.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.825
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, pal.

19:54.827 --> 19:58.963
Besides, he threatened
to have you guys arrested.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.999
I thought I'd work
through this myself.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.970
ALF, what was the last thing
you tried to do by yourself?

20:05.972 --> 20:08.706
Build a skating rink
in the living room.

20:09.676 --> 20:13.211
Egad! A pattern.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.713
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees you.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.283
Okay, but wait.
We can't leave my friend.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.952
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.455
- I named her after your wife.
- Kate?

20:24.457 --> 20:26.123
Bossy.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.661
Besides, you know
what happens to them.

20:33.366 --> 20:37.668
ALF...this is a milk cow.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.304
They don't slaughter milk cows.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.775
They don't? You lying cow!

20:44.777 --> 20:47.678
Come on. Let's hit the trail,
Willie Earp.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.615
Somebody's coming.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.516
I'll hide in the kitchen.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.287
- Where's the kitchen?
- Just hide.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.761
Who are you?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.764
I'm Willie Tanner.
I'm from the city.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.235
- What are you doin' here?
- Oh, well, I-I..

21:11.237 --> 21:14.872
I know what you're doing.
You're a chicken thief!

21:14.874 --> 21:17.775
Oh, no, no, no, you see..

21:17.777 --> 21:19.343
I really hate thieves.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.913
They're always taking things
that don't belong to 'em.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.819
You win.

21:28.821 --> 21:32.023
Well, look here. My car ran out
of gas down the road.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.759
I was just wondering if maybe
I could get some from you?

21:34.761 --> 21:37.194
Why didn't you say so? Sure.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.330
I can fill this up for ya,
I got a tank.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.365
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.567
Say, how much would
you want for that?

21:43.569 --> 21:46.070
Oh! Twenty dollars.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.074
Twenty dollars
for a gallon of gas?

21:51.144 --> 21:54.645
The nearest gas station
is a four hour walk.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.848
Kinda cold to be
walking in jammies.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.119
Thank you.
I'll go fill this up for you.

22:05.992 --> 22:10.261
He was nice.
Why didn't you tip him?

22:10.263 --> 22:13.197
- Just get back to the car.
- Okay. Race you back to town.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.599
No, there's not gonna
be any racing.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.602
Kate's gonna drive our car.
I'm gonna take Trevor's.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.805
Okay. Just a second.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.608
Bossy, it's been a pleasure.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.744
Take care of yourself and..

22:26.746 --> 22:29.180
...watch that cholesterol, huh?

22:32.218 --> 22:34.785
[instrumental music]

22:38.991 --> 22:40.691
Well?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.760
Well, it looks like
we were right.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.495
Frazier's supervisor
at the INS

22:44.497 --> 22:46.897
said they've suspected him
for a long time

22:46.899 --> 22:49.266
of shaking down
illegal immigrants.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.470
Now, he's been suspended
pending an investigation.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.704
Oh! Alright.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.006
Well, I wish
I would've been here.

22:56.008 --> 22:59.810
I'd have realigned
his front end.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.979
It just scares me to think
how close you came

23:01.981 --> 23:04.849
to actually turning yourself in.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.818
You saved my life, Willie.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.787
I'll never forget it.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.522
From now on..

23:11.524 --> 23:14.125
...you are my slave.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.428
So what else is new?
