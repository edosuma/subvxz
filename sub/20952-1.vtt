00:33.133 --> 00:34.801
<i>Oh no, oh no, he fell!</i>

00:35.936 --> 00:37.371
<i>-He made it!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:43.143
<i>Go!</i>

00:44.111 --> 00:45.779
<i>And he's in!</i>

04:26.633 --> 04:30.170
<i>My name is Markus.</i>
<i>I am 37 years old and from Stuttgart.</i>

04:30.237 --> 04:32.973
I am one of the oldest competitors here.

04:33.874 --> 04:39.680
<i>I have been running obstacle courses</i>
<i>for five years now and have won</i>

04:39.746 --> 04:41.548
almost every European race with my team.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.652
Ultimate Beastmaster <i>is one</i>
<i>of the highlights of my career.</i>

04:52.025 --> 04:54.328
<i>-Go for it, Markus!</i>
<i>-Okay!</i>

04:54.394 --> 04:57.331
-Germany!
-Germany!

06:22.983 --> 06:27.554
-That was close.
-Yes!

06:59.319 --> 07:02.956
Gravity can be such a bitch, right, Hans?

07:04.291 --> 07:08.328
Incredible! I had the jitters,
but I did it!

08:23.870 --> 08:25.839
My strength is this handsome face.

08:26.240 --> 08:31.278
I'm not going to lose to anybody.
My weakness is that I have none.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.921
Oh, Korea!

09:51.425 --> 09:54.194
<i>I am my own inspiration.</i>
<i>It's me for myself.</i>

09:54.261 --> 09:57.564
<i>I came to trample over everybody,</i>
<i>without fear.</i>

10:09.843 --> 10:12.012
Wow!

10:25.125 --> 10:28.195
Show us your grit! It was no good!

10:57.257 --> 10:59.760
I'll defeat the Beast. I'll beat you!

11:05.599 --> 11:09.469
When I set my mind on something,
I do it.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.612
-No!
-No!

11:18.679 --> 11:21.248
No! What happened?

11:21.315 --> 11:23.917
Go, Mexico! For my family!

14:38.512 --> 14:41.148
He's number one! Go, Omar!

14:41.215 --> 14:43.116
Go, Mexico!

14:43.183 --> 14:44.251
We're with you!

14:44.318 --> 14:46.119
Go, Omar! Very good!

14:52.025 --> 14:55.229
<i>I had an accident, sadly,</i>
<i>that changed the course of my life.</i>

14:55.295 --> 14:59.066
It separated my femur from my hip,
caused a fifth vertebrae deviation,

14:59.132 --> 15:03.570
fractured my elbow.
I spent eight months in bed.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.512
Omar, with your fingertips,

15:12.579 --> 15:15.482
with your eyelashes, with your knees!
I don't know how, girl!

15:23.257 --> 15:25.459
No! What happened?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.731
Brazil is going strong!

15:44.777 --> 15:45.611
Brazil!

15:50.883 --> 15:54.353
-Simon Brunner!
-Come on!

16:15.843 --> 16:19.079
Simon Brunner
with a sensational performance

16:19.146 --> 16:21.348
here at <i>Ultimate Beastmaster.</i>

17:02.990 --> 17:05.993
You're our eldest competitor. Go for it.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.228
I didn't realize it
until coming here, but...

17:08.295 --> 17:10.898
age is just a number,
and I'm gonna prove it.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.534
We'll give it our all! <i>Osu!</i>

18:15.028 --> 18:19.199
Toyohiko Kubota... a regrettable fall!

18:19.900 --> 18:21.468
<i>Go, Korea! Korea!</i>

18:37.184 --> 18:43.423
The proudest moment
of my life was when

18:43.490 --> 18:49.096
<i>I became the Ice Climbing World Cup</i>
<i>champion in 2001 and 2013.</i>

18:50.162 --> 18:53.366
And I came here to be
the number one Beastmaster.

18:54.368 --> 18:55.736
<i>Team Korea fighting!</i>

18:58.572 --> 19:01.208
Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:19.960 --> 19:22.396
That's it! Taekwondo kick!

21:14.006 --> 21:14.974
He's gonna make it!

21:23.984 --> 21:27.254
Incredible! Respect.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.824
And look, he actually did it.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.716
The countries are very strong,

23:02.783 --> 23:06.053
especially the Koreans and the Germans.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.024
I'll do my best,
and I want to get to the end.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.852
I'm so proud of him.

23:40.287 --> 23:43.323
And he will make up for it!

23:51.632 --> 23:55.135
World Ice Climbing champion!

23:55.769 --> 23:58.105
-This is world class!
-The best in the world!

24:30.270 --> 24:32.472
This is world class!

24:32.539 --> 24:34.541
The best two in the world!

25:11.076 --> 25:13.445
Heeyong Park, he fell this time!

25:25.726 --> 25:28.362
I'm hoping for a second chance.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.100
Omar!

26:11.772 --> 26:13.707
And there's the second one!

26:13.774 --> 26:16.009
Well done, Omar! Way to go!

27:01.220 --> 27:03.622
Another 20 points for my man Omar,

27:03.689 --> 27:05.624
and he's still alive,
still moving forward!

27:24.978 --> 27:27.548
My legs got too tired,
and I think that's why...

27:27.614 --> 27:29.483
I was close, I pushed it well!

27:29.550 --> 27:33.020
I pushed it very well, and I saw it closer
than the other ones, but...

27:36.123 --> 27:38.458
One of the best experiences of my life!

27:44.997 --> 27:48.600
I'm from a small, boring village.

27:49.036 --> 27:53.740
<i>I enjoy trying out new, cool projects,</i>

27:53.807 --> 27:58.111
<i>like going into the Alps barefoot.</i>

27:58.178 --> 28:01.315
<i>I think this could help me</i>
<i>with </i>Beastmaster

28:01.381 --> 28:04.251
<i>because I know how to deal</i>
<i>with the unfamiliar.</i>

28:13.760 --> 28:16.463
-He was able to pull himself up!
-Right!

28:40.621 --> 28:44.558
Simon Brunner. He is so calm,
agile and flexible.

28:44.625 --> 28:47.661
He is one of the big shots
in this competition.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.429
He will get very far.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.733
<i>Come on, Simon! Come on, buddy!</i>

30:47.614 --> 30:52.386
He fell. It is over for him.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.762
My forearms gave out.

31:42.970 --> 31:43.937
-No!
-He is falling!

32:00.485 --> 32:01.853
No!

32:01.922 --> 32:04.491
Matias, no...

32:29.750 --> 32:33.187
-Very well!
-Now prepare your hearts...

32:33.253 --> 32:36.557
Prepare your hearts, because...

32:37.556 --> 32:38.723
Now the going gets tough.

32:43.895 --> 32:49.601
When I was 12 years old, I participated
in a soccer crowd fight. Very dangerous.

32:50.504 --> 32:53.841
<i>I managed to drop that life</i>
<i>because it wasn't good for me.</i>

32:54.508 --> 32:56.276
I love you.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.078
<i>My son is my greatest inspiration.</i>

32:58.145 --> 33:01.114
And if I win the title
of Ultimate Beastmaster,

33:01.181 --> 33:04.017
<i>I'll invest in my son's future</i>

33:04.084 --> 33:07.187
<i>and in something that will</i>
<i>bring me a return...</i>

33:07.921 --> 33:09.790
<i>so I can live more doing what I love.</i>

33:43.790 --> 33:45.692
Brazil!

33:50.497 --> 33:52.533
Take that, Germany!

33:52.599 --> 33:54.067
Germany is in the corner. Take that!

34:32.673 --> 34:35.509
Go, go!

34:36.510 --> 34:38.278
Take your time! Breathe!

34:52.159 --> 34:55.996
I can't believe he was eliminated
on the easiest gear.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.029
The easiest gear.

35:08.408 --> 35:12.813
I wish I had made it to the tube.
It was my biggest challenge.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.648
Okay, thanks.

36:09.837 --> 36:10.971
Mexico!

40:24.322 --> 40:25.823
I started very well.

40:26.193 --> 40:30.464
If I had jumped in the middle,
it would have worked out.

40:33.800 --> 40:38.438
I got cut off at Level 2, and that's...

40:40.207 --> 40:42.609
I'm going for the bonus track

40:42.676 --> 40:46.046
because I need a lot of points.

42:50.204 --> 42:52.506
Come on, let's go!

43:02.416 --> 43:04.184
-He grabbed it!
-He's starting Weapon!

43:04.251 --> 43:06.954
One, two... Park Heeyong!

43:57.201 --> 44:00.771
Park Heeyong!

44:06.544 --> 44:11.349
Park Heeyong!

44:18.189 --> 44:22.660
The best day since I got here.

44:34.241 --> 44:35.442
Korea!

44:41.782 --> 44:43.317
Heeyong Park!

44:57.695 --> 44:59.263
I've got Omar's support.

44:59.330 --> 45:03.701
He helped out a lot,
pointed out my mistakes,

45:03.770 --> 45:05.973
and I shared his. Yeah.

45:06.607 --> 45:10.477
We motivated each other a lot.
A great synergy there.

45:11.211 --> 45:13.247
The Mexican team will reach the finals.

45:13.313 --> 45:14.982
-Go Mexico!
-Let's go!

45:24.925 --> 45:26.727
He didn't last long.

45:42.176 --> 45:45.412
It slipped, I felt it right there!
I had it!

45:46.346 --> 45:49.016
It slipped. It was a perfect jump, though.

45:49.082 --> 45:51.885
I saw it, I had a lock on it,
but I couldn't make it.

47:08.128 --> 47:11.732
Germany!

47:36.190 --> 47:40.894
I fell off here. Maybe I didn't
concentrate enough, but I feel good.

47:40.961 --> 47:42.095
<i>I hope this is enough.</i>

48:03.750 --> 48:05.686
Germany!

48:05.752 --> 48:08.889
Hey guys, Mexico's next! Go, Omar!

48:32.446 --> 48:35.716
What happened was that
I lost concentration

48:36.180 --> 48:39.016
for a moment, and that got me
eliminated from the competition.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.703
Park Heeyong!

52:43.830 --> 52:46.934
Park Heeyong! Park Heeyong!

52:48.735 --> 52:53.273
Beastmaster Park Heeyong!

53:14.761 --> 53:19.166
I'm so proud that I achieved something

53:19.233 --> 53:22.536
on American soil as a Korean.

53:22.603 --> 53:27.274
All the Koreans back home watching this,

53:27.337 --> 53:28.405
way to go!
