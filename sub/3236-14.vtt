00:20.320 --> 00:23.279
Yo, so, what's next?

00:23.480 --> 00:24.755
We wait.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.835
We don't got like eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

00:29.600 --> 00:31.398
The reaction has begun.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.798
Yeah, I know. So how long?

00:35.000 --> 00:39.313
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed
liquid would cool more quickly

00:39.560 --> 00:43.554
because, of course,
this is an exothermic reaction,
which means

00:43.760 --> 00:44.876
"giving off heat."

00:45.080 --> 00:47.117
And our desired product is...

00:47.320 --> 00:50.518
Put me into a coma, why don't you?

00:51.560 --> 00:53.074
What did you just say?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.199
What? What? Nothing.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.519
Huh.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.396
No, no, no. Not in here.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.876
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.118
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.879
Dick.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.356
Aah.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.911
God. Jesus. God.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.156
Shut up.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.392
Oh, wow.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.430
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.916
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.555
He's got a stick up his butt?

01:53.800 --> 01:56.793
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.471
So anyway, he's insisting that I--

02:00.720 --> 02:03.952
He's demanding that I stay

02:04.160 --> 02:06.356
and look over his system

02:06.600 --> 02:08.990
and I cannot get out of it.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.560
Yeah.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.671
Hello.
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

02:24.880 --> 02:27.634
Hey, you. What's going on?
<i>Nothing much.</i>

02:27.840 --> 02:33.598
I was just calling
to say I'm sorry

02:33.840 --> 02:36.071
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.431
Bogdan. He's got
a bug up his butt.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.714
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner, so...

02:42.920 --> 02:47.199
In fact, you could take pity on us
and bring a pizza home.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.596
They're having a two-for-one
at Venezia's.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.315
At this point,
I could eat a whole one by myself.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.031
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I can pick up a pizza.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.317
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.753
He better not. Trust me,
he does not want to piss off
a hungry pregnant woman.

03:02.960 --> 03:08.080
Ooh, what's that sound?
<i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>

03:08.280 --> 03:10.875
The hideous crying clown.
<i>Wow.</i>

03:11.120 --> 03:14.511
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.712
Shows what I know about art.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.475
<i>Hey, what do you think about Holly?</i>

03:20.400 --> 03:22.073
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

03:22.280 --> 03:23.839
Do you like it?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.679
I think I really like it.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.278
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.715
Let me think about it.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.152
Just feels right, you know?
It's my new favorite.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.676
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.

03:43.080 --> 03:48.200
Listen, I was thinking, um, maybe we can
have a little family time this weekend.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.392
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
Yeah.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.592
You know, just take a drive.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.110
The almost four of us.
Ha-ha-ha.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.516
<i>Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail,</i>

03:57.720 --> 04:00.872
<i>stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>

04:01.080 --> 04:03.390
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.670
<i>I know.</i>
Yeah.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.600
<i>So why don't we just do that?
Take a little break?</i>

04:08.280 --> 04:10.556
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

04:10.760 --> 04:13.514
Holly. It's growing on me.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.110
Yep. Me too.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.910
All right, well, I had better go
and get this in the mail.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.794
<i>Why don't you call me
when you're on your way home?</i>

04:23.000 --> 04:26.277
Will do. Love you.
<i>Love you too.</i>

06:07.320 --> 06:10.074
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.311
What the hell did we just walk into?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.950
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.992
He was right here before.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.476
- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
- No.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.400
What do you figure? He maybe
headed down that gully there?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.154
That's the way I'd go.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.273
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.119
Jack.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.595
These guys are DEA.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.159
No! Jack, no!

06:48.360 --> 06:50.033
Jack! Jack! Jack!

06:50.240 --> 06:51.993
No! No, don't!

06:52.200 --> 06:54.351
Jack, don't. No.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.196
No, Jack, Jack, Jack!
Jack, no!

06:59.560 --> 07:01.552
Jack, no. Don't kill him.
Uh-uh-uh. Back it up.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.752
Don't kill him, Jack.
Get back here.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.235
The hell not? He's DEA.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.915
No, he's family.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.276
Say again?

07:11.040 --> 07:13.032
He's my family.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.233
He's my brother-in-law.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.591
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

07:17.800 --> 07:20.269
you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

07:21.720 --> 07:24.679
Did you know about this?
I called you off, remember?

07:24.920 --> 07:28.357
I told you not to come.
Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.234
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Too late now.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.276
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here? Hm?

07:35.480 --> 07:39.030
You and your brother-in-law
don't seem to be getting along too well.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.153
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't concern you.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.558
We just wasted his partner here,
and he's wearing a bullet,

07:45.760 --> 07:48.400
so, yeah, I'd say
it does concern me.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.320
This is between him and me.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.034
No cavalry coming?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.634
No.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.320
You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.273
No, no, no! Jack--

07:59.640 --> 08:02.633
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.159
Not yet.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.239
Hank.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.193
Nothing can change
what just happened,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.040
but you can walk out of here alive

08:18.240 --> 08:22.917
if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.916
Yeah, I thought as much.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.800
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.957
No, no, no, listen! I have money!

08:33.200 --> 08:37.240
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

08:40.280 --> 08:42.840
It's $80 million.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.360
Eighty million.

08:53.360 --> 08:58.276
Hm. So that's what got
this party started, huh?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.033
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.916
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything. Think about it.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.431
You can have any future
that you want.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.116
Jack.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.478
Eighty million.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.434
And all you've got to do

09:20.400 --> 09:22.278
is let him go.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.312
That's a hell of an offer.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.558
What do you think, fed?

09:27.080 --> 09:28.594
Would you take that deal?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.553
It's Hank.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.995
His name is Hank.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.152
How about it, Hank?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.757
Should I let you go?

09:46.040 --> 09:48.794
My name is ASAC Schrader.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.791
And you can go fuck yourself.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.791
Hank, listen to me.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.835
You gotta tell him.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.600
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.996
Please. Please.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.951
What? You want me to beg?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.399
You're the smartest guy I ever met.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.430
And you're too stupid to see...

10:19.920 --> 10:21.877
he made up his mind
10 minutes ago.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.909
Do what you're gonna do.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.956
Pretty specific directions.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.551
Most people tell me to be somewhere,
they say, "West on the 40,

11:16.760 --> 11:20.674
this or that exit, second gas station
on the left." You know?

11:20.880 --> 11:24.351
This here? This is a whole other story.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.076
That fancy phone of yours,
where does it say this is exactly?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.278
Yeah.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.990
Look at this.
They even brought a shovel.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.514
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.993
All right.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.556
Says this is it right here.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.274
Dig.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.871
What's that? A barrel?
Couple barrels?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.559
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hell, yeah!

12:33.760 --> 12:35.672
Oh, Jesus. Would you
look at that? Ha-ha-ha.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.111
- Hell, yeah!
- Goddamn.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.512
Whoo!

12:43.440 --> 12:45.193
What are you waiting for?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.635
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.674
Let me get on this side.
Get that out of there, man.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.274
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.598
Seriously?
Jack.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.595
That's like 10 or 11 million right there.
You sure you wanna do that?

13:47.840 --> 13:50.196
You gonna make me
say it again? Go, go.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.754
Chop, chop.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.679
Jesus, what's with
all the greed here?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.673
It's unattractive.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.354
Hey.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.674
Hey.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.557
I'm leaving you a barrel.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.997
Boys are gonna load it for you.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.156
You got the keys to these cuffs?

14:24.240 --> 14:26.072
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.115
My nephew here, he respects you.

14:33.840 --> 14:39.438
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.438
Also you caught me in a good mood.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.077
So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get in your car,

14:46.320 --> 14:49.677
and you're gonna drive out of here,
all right?

14:50.760 --> 14:52.911
No hard feelings.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.993
Understand me?

14:56.840 --> 14:58.399
We square?

14:59.480 --> 15:03.713
Hey, man, I gotta know
we're square, or we're gonna
have to go that other way.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.839
Pinkman.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.718
Pinkman.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.756
You still owe me.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.596
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.840
Found him.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.599
No!

15:48.800 --> 15:50.837
Get off me!

15:51.040 --> 15:52.076
Get off!

15:55.920 --> 15:57.718
No, no.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.876
Good to go?

16:20.760 --> 16:21.796
Hey, Uncle Jack.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.555
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.074
Right? Working with them.
Should we maybe find out
what he told them first?

16:38.280 --> 16:41.114
Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

16:41.320 --> 16:43.710
that might not be too good for us.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.956
And I'll bet we could

16:46.120 --> 16:48.680
get it out of him back home.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.196
I mean, I can do it.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.394
Me and him, we got history.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.912
And then, you know, we'd
take care of the job after that.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.077
Works for me. Work for you?

17:11.359 --> 17:13.192
Let's go, pal.
No.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.880
No!

17:15.079 --> 17:16.594
No!

17:16.839 --> 17:17.990
No!

17:18.200 --> 17:19.714
Wait.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.760
I watched Jane die.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.312
I was there.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.353
And I watched her die.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.392
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.437
I could have saved her.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.232
But I didn't.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.794
Hi.
Hello.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.632
That truck belong to you?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.240
It does.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.595
I'd like to buy it.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.197
It's not for sale.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.516
Hey, Walt, it's me. Um,

23:15.720 --> 23:17.393
just thought I'd try you again.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.513
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

23:20.720 --> 23:24.760
so just give us a call
whenever you can.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.994
Bye.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.233
Hey, Aunt Marie.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.272
Hey, sweetie.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.034
Haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.436
Oh, you know. This and that.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.230
Your mom and I need to talk,
so thought I'd stop by.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.473
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.070
This isn't the best time.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.835
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.077
Why don't we go into your office?

23:58.960 --> 24:00.792
I got it.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.950
Okay, honey. Thanks.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.398
Marie, I have nothing to say.
Well, I do.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.519
So you can just sit there
and listen.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.157
I got a call from Hank.
He arrested Walt

24:29.400 --> 24:30.720
three hours ago.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.479
It's over.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.479
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.310
Hank and Steve Gomez are working
with a former associate of Walt's,

24:39.520 --> 24:42.672
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

24:42.880 --> 24:46.351
and Pinkman has supplied them
with everything they need.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.430
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.235
And I, for one, could not be happier.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.117
I almost didn't come here.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.794
Christ, I barely even know
who you are,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.471
and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.

25:14.680 --> 25:19.391
And then I think about
how you were so upset with Walt

25:19.600 --> 25:22.399
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

25:22.600 --> 25:27.311
and all of this makes me believe
that there has got to be hope for you,

25:27.520 --> 25:31.309
that whatever he did to you
can be undone.

25:34.400 --> 25:39.873
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

25:40.080 --> 25:41.639
is that you are my sister.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.238
And so I'm here.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.793
Marie--
Everything changes now.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.038
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.398
Hank will help you as much
as he can. I know he will.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.436
And I will support you through this.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.757
But I have conditions.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.270
Give me every single copy
of that obscenity

26:09.480 --> 26:10.880
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

26:11.040 --> 26:15.956
That DVD. Every single copy.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.393
You understand me?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.993
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

26:21.200 --> 26:22.634
Yes.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.753
Good.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.557
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.838
You are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.390
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.557
Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.514
No. No. No, he cannot know.
You tell him,

26:42.360 --> 26:44.079
or I will.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.677
There's no way around this.

26:46.880 --> 26:50.715
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.080
No.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.720
Look, I gave you what you wanted.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.158
Come on, please.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.714
Hey, please.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.355
I told you where to find the tape, okay?
Yup.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.876
Hey, just go.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.595
Just go there.
Just go to his house and get it.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.599
We're on it.
Get it!

28:01.720 --> 28:05.270
No one else knows about it.
Just me and his partner.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.439
Okay.
No one else knows, I swear!

30:01.760 --> 30:03.353
Let's cook.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.557
You're completely out of your mind.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.637
It's the truth.
It is, Flynn.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.111
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.994
You're full of shit,
is what you are. Both of you.

30:26.200 --> 30:30.160
If this is true, then how could you
keep this a secret?

30:30.360 --> 30:34.718
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

30:36.240 --> 30:39.233
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.

30:39.480 --> 30:43.156
So you're saying all this time
you were lying about this?

30:43.400 --> 30:46.711
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.877
You just admitted it.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.676
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

30:52.880 --> 30:54.280
Which lie is it?

30:54.480 --> 30:55.596
Flynn, honey,

30:55.800 --> 30:57.154
your mother
is telling you the truth.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.114
Right here, right now. Believe it.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.280
You know what? This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.994
Baby--
I wanna talk to Dad.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.238
Your dad's in custody.
You can't talk to him for a while.

31:09.440 --> 31:12.433
I'm calling Uncle Hank.
I've tried. He's not answering.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.592
He's probably in the thick of it

31:14.760 --> 31:17.958
with your father. Honey, I know
this is a lot to process, Flynn,

31:18.160 --> 31:21.073
but if you could just breathe,
just try to breathe

31:21.280 --> 31:24.352
and just trust--
Really? Really? Try to breathe?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.114
Oh, my God.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.840
Go home.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.714
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.877
I'll stop by later.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.280
Flynn?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.840
Could you put
your seatbelt on, please?

32:21.280 --> 32:23.715
Please. It's not safe.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.591
You're shitting me, right?

32:30.800 --> 32:34.760
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

32:34.960 --> 32:38.237
then you're as bad as him.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.877
Whose truck is that?

32:56.720 --> 32:58.313
Dad?

32:59.880 --> 33:04.352
Listen, I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.517
Mom, Aunt Marie,

33:06.720 --> 33:08.313
they said that you were arrested?
No, just--

33:08.480 --> 33:10.153
You're some kind of drug dealer?

33:10.360 --> 33:12.352
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.710
Come inside. Come on.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.752
Go, go, go.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.709
Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please.
Our priority right now is to pack.

33:19.880 --> 33:24.033
Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you?
I will discuss all of this later, okay?

33:24.240 --> 33:25.356
Just tell me what--

33:25.560 --> 33:26.710
Just listen to me!

33:26.920 --> 33:29.594
Go into your bedroom now,
grab anything important.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.952
You understand? Go. Now.
Both of you. Go.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.276
Walt.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.710
Why are you here?

33:38.280 --> 33:40.795
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.037
For you and the kids. Now.
This is our priority.

33:43.560 --> 33:47.076
Hank had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.115
Where is he?
I--

33:49.320 --> 33:52.199
Where's Hank?
I....

33:52.400 --> 33:53.516
I negotiated--

33:53.760 --> 33:55.399
Negotiated?
Yes.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.478
What does that mean?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.712
It means we're fine, okay?

34:02.920 --> 34:05.594
We are. We're fine.
Everything is gonna be fine,

34:05.800 --> 34:07.598
but we need to leave right now.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.835
All right? Can we do that?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.070
What happened?

34:10.920 --> 34:12.353
Where is Hank?

34:12.560 --> 34:13.960
Why do we need to leave?

34:14.159 --> 34:17.676
I need both of you to trust me.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.837
Right now, okay?

34:20.040 --> 34:22.110
Please, just work with me here,

34:22.320 --> 34:25.996
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

34:26.199 --> 34:30.797
Where is Hank?

34:34.480 --> 34:36.039
Skyler.

34:39.199 --> 34:45.719
I have $11 million in cash
right outside.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.516
We can have a fresh start.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.755
Whole new lives.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.952
All we have to do is go.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.470
We have to go right now.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.070
That's all we have to do.

35:04.320 --> 35:07.279
You killed him.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.278
You killed Hank.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.039
What?
No, no, no.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.800
You killed him. Aah!
No, no, no!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.719
I tried to save him.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.151
Uncle Hank is dead? I--

35:22.360 --> 35:25.831
Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true.
Just stop, please.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.997
Everything is gonna be okay.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.910
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise,
but we need to leave right now.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.589
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.156
Just stop for one second.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.518
- Look, I told you to get your things.
- Stop walking away.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.030
- There is no time.
- Tell me about Uncle Hank.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.636
- No, just drop it!
- But what's wrong with you?

35:45.840 --> 35:47.832
We're going.
We're going right now.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.032
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.677
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What--?

35:57.880 --> 35:59.155
Get out.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.749
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.917
Enough.
Mom,

36:05.120 --> 36:06.679
what are you doing?

36:06.880 --> 36:09.076
Skyler, put the knife down, please.

36:09.280 --> 36:14.958
I promise you, everything--
Don't say one more word.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.798
Get out of here now.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.711
Skyler--
Get out!

36:27.160 --> 36:31.313
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!

36:31.520 --> 36:35.275
Let go! Let go!
Get away from us!

36:35.480 --> 36:37.312
Just stop! Stop!

36:37.760 --> 36:40.434
Dad, stop it! Stop!

36:40.640 --> 36:42.279
Mom, stop it.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.076
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.034
Stop! Just, please, stop!

36:48.600 --> 36:51.991
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

36:58.360 --> 37:02.149
What the hell is wrong with you?!
We're a family!

37:07.720 --> 37:09.439
We're a family.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.272
What are you doing?

37:15.480 --> 37:16.960
What are you doing?

37:17.160 --> 37:18.389
Yeah, I need the police.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.115
My dad, he pulled a knife
on my mom.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.880
He attacked her. He's dangerous.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.152
I think he might have
killed somebody.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.033
Yeah.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.552
He's still here.

37:32.760 --> 37:35.594
Yeah, he's still in the house.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.760
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.431
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.032
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!

37:47.920 --> 37:49.798
Oh, my God. No.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.231
Walt, no! Walt!
Mom!

37:52.440 --> 37:54.113
Walt, please, no!

37:54.320 --> 37:57.552
No! No! No!

37:57.760 --> 37:59.638
Walt, no! Let her go!

37:59.880 --> 38:01.473
You can't take her!

38:01.680 --> 38:04.514
Let her go, please!
You can't take her!

38:04.760 --> 38:06.831
Let her go! Walt!

38:07.040 --> 38:10.317
Walt, please, no!

38:10.520 --> 38:12.876
Walt, no! Walt, please!

38:14.200 --> 38:15.839
Walt, no!

38:16.040 --> 38:18.839
Walt, please, no!

38:19.040 --> 38:21.919
Walt, please!

38:22.120 --> 38:25.113
Please, stop! Walt!

38:38.920 --> 38:40.513
Say, "Da-da."

38:40.720 --> 38:43.030
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?

38:43.240 --> 38:47.075
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

38:47.280 --> 38:49.954
Don't be sad.
Where's your belly button?

38:50.160 --> 38:52.595
Where's your belly button?

38:52.800 --> 38:55.076
There. Now, don't you feel better?

38:55.280 --> 38:58.273
You're all nice and dry. Huh?

38:58.480 --> 39:00.312
That feels good? Oh, I know.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.997
You were so wet and so cranky,
but now you feel better, don't you?

39:04.200 --> 39:08.877
Next order of business
is to get you a brand-new car seat.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.390
Won't that be nice, Holly?

39:15.360 --> 39:17.192
Mama.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.357
Mama.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.952
Mama.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.237
Mama.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.118
Mama.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.319
Mama.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.354
Mama.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.279
Confirming the abduction.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.075
Amber Alert. Holly White.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.351
Female, 18 months.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.472
Blond hair, blue eyes.

40:01.680 --> 40:06.709
Was last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket, pink pants.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.519
Abductor is the father...

40:08.760 --> 40:14.040
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.

40:14.360 --> 40:18.639
Bald head, goatee,
gold, wire-framed glasses.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.478
Are you expecting a call?

40:24.800 --> 40:28.111
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.</i>

40:28.360 --> 40:30.556
<i>Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.</i>

40:30.760 --> 40:34.151
That's him. That's my husband.
<i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>

40:34.360 --> 40:35.760
Start a trace on the landline.

40:35.960 --> 40:41.433
The number's 505-177-8987.
<i>I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>

40:41.640 --> 40:43.472
<i>Skyler, you hear me?</i>

40:43.640 --> 40:44.960
Need the location of an incoming caller.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.998
<i>Answer the pho--</i>

40:50.840 --> 40:53.196
Walt, where's Holly?

40:53.400 --> 40:54.993
<i>Are you alone?</i>

40:55.200 --> 40:56.953
<i>No police?</i>

40:58.400 --> 41:01.359
No. No police.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.991
Where are you? Where's Holly?

41:07.440 --> 41:10.353
Walt!
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

41:10.560 --> 41:14.520
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>

41:14.960 --> 41:17.236
What?
<i>This is your fault.</i>

41:17.440 --> 41:20.194
<i>This is what comes of your disrespect.</i>

41:20.400 --> 41:22.119
I told you, Skyler.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.879
I warned you for a solid year.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.635
You cross me,
there will be consequences.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.917
What part of that
didn't you understand?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.840
You took my child.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.394
<i>Because you need to learn.</i>

41:33.600 --> 41:35.478
You bring her back.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.919
Maybe now you'll listen.
Maybe now you'll use your damn head.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.430
You know, you never believed in me.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.752
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.670
<i>"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.</i>

41:49.880 --> 41:53.715
<i>You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

41:53.920 --> 41:56.116
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>

41:56.360 --> 42:00.036
<i>You're always whining and complaining
about how I make my money,</i>

42:00.280 --> 42:04.194
<i>just dragging me down,
while I do everything.</i>

42:06.680 --> 42:07.830
<i>And now--</i>

42:08.080 --> 42:12.199
Now you tell my son what I do,

42:12.400 --> 42:19.113
<i>after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

42:19.320 --> 42:23.234
You stupid bitch.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.112
<i>How dare you?</i>

42:38.840 --> 42:40.877
I'm sorry.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.830
You have no right

42:50.080 --> 42:53.357
to discuss anything about what I do.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.836
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

42:56.040 --> 42:58.271
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

42:58.480 --> 43:00.551
<i>Me. Me alone. Nobody else!</i>

43:00.800 --> 43:02.359
You're right.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.999
You're right.

43:07.160 --> 43:09.675
You mark my words, Skyler.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.677
Toe the line

43:14.560 --> 43:17.632
or you will wind up just like Hank.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.760
Walt.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.916
Tell me what happened.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.997
Where is Hank?

43:29.520 --> 43:31.273
Please.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.672
We need to know.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.835
You're never gonna see Hank again.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.197
<i>He crossed me.</i>

43:51.280 --> 43:52.600
<i>You think about that.</i>

43:54.840 --> 43:56.832
<i>Family or no.</i>

43:59.040 --> 44:01.635
You let that sink in.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.633
<i>Walt.</i>

44:06.680 --> 44:09.878
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

44:11.880 --> 44:14.475
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

44:17.480 --> 44:19.437
<i>Just come home.</i>

44:26.800 --> 44:29.759
I've still got things left to do.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.155
Hey.
