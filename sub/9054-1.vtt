01:29.166 --> 01:31.498
By late in the 21st century,

01:31.568 --> 01:34.560
the nations of the Earth
were finally at peace,

01:34.638 --> 01:37.869
working together
to explore and colonize...

01:37.941 --> 01:40.432
the distant reaches
of space.

01:45.683 --> 01:50.211
Unfortunately,
we weren't alone out there.

01:50.287 --> 01:53.154
A race of nonhuman aliens
called the Dracs...

01:53.223 --> 01:55.157
were claiming
squatters' rights...

01:55.225 --> 01:58.786
to some of the richest
star systems in the galaxy.

01:58.862 --> 02:03.162
Well, they weren't going to
get it without a fight.

02:08.472 --> 02:11.441
Space was
the new battleground.

02:11.508 --> 02:17.105
For many of us, Earth became
a precious memory light-years away.

02:20.751 --> 02:23.914
Our only home
was a fortress in space.

02:23.987 --> 02:25.921
As in any war,

02:25.989 --> 02:29.458
there were long periods
with nothing to do but wait.

02:29.592 --> 02:31.423
And then...

02:41.771 --> 02:43.602
All personnel
to battle stations.

02:43.672 --> 02:45.731
Prepare to launch.
This is not an exercise.

02:45.808 --> 02:49.141
All personnel
to battle stations.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.202
Prepare to launch.
This is not an exercise.

03:00.623 --> 03:04.059
Flight leader. This is Echo Two.
I have four bandits at 3:00.

03:04.126 --> 03:06.890
Roger, Echo Two. I copy.
Right ninety and go for it.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.466
Echo Six to flight leader.
Our buddies are pulling the yellow line.

03:16.539 --> 03:20.066
Roger, Echo Six.
Cleared one on one with two backup.

03:23.712 --> 03:25.646
Snuff these bastards,
get home early.

03:25.714 --> 03:27.648
I got a hot date
with Merchison.

03:27.716 --> 03:31.277
- The nurse?
- She's gonna give in. I guarantee it.

03:31.353 --> 03:34.686
Isn't that the same Merchison
we used to call "the white balloon"?

03:34.757 --> 03:37.521
Come on,
she's lost 20 pounds.

03:39.161 --> 03:41.026
Got you!

03:41.097 --> 03:43.861
- That'a boy. Six more bandits on three.
- Yeah!

03:46.569 --> 03:49.538
- Leader, copy that?
- They thought we didn't see 'em.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.472
- I didn't see 'em. Did anybody see 'em?
- I see 'em now.

03:57.913 --> 04:00.507
- Well?
- Will, bandit on zero.

04:03.419 --> 04:05.979
Hold on
to your lunch, Joey.

04:08.090 --> 04:11.025
Echo Six,
bandit's closing!

04:11.093 --> 04:13.891
- Where is he, Will?
- He's right on your damn...

04:15.564 --> 04:17.555
- Oh, Jesus!
- Bastard!

04:20.202 --> 04:24.002
- How many K's we got left?
- Sixty-five. We have a heat problem.

04:26.275 --> 04:29.870
- What the hell's Will doing?
- Say your prayers, toad face.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.747
Shit!

04:33.816 --> 04:36.216
Engine heat beyond normal!

04:37.987 --> 04:39.750
Blast 'em,
and let's get out of here!

04:39.822 --> 04:42.484
That's Fyrine four,
unexplored territory.

04:42.558 --> 04:44.753
Okay. Do it.

04:44.827 --> 04:48.058
Aah!

04:52.968 --> 04:55.596
- We're hitting atmosphere.
- Visors down!

04:57.673 --> 04:59.937
I lost him!
What's on the scope?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.569
Willie, pull out!
We're gonna burn up!

05:02.645 --> 05:04.840
Damn it,
where is he?

05:04.914 --> 05:06.939
He ejected!
He's out!

05:07.016 --> 05:10.213
The bastard's out!

05:14.256 --> 05:16.747
Come on, Joey.
We're punching out!

05:17.927 --> 05:20.953
Oh, shit!
Get your nose up.

05:23.265 --> 05:26.234
Get your nose up.
That's it.

05:30.673 --> 05:33.540
Get up, get up!
Easy.

05:43.819 --> 05:46.913
Come on, Joey.

05:48.791 --> 05:51.453
Come on.

06:05.207 --> 06:07.675
Joey!

06:09.678 --> 06:13.774
- Are you ok, Will?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:13.849 --> 06:16.613
Will...

06:16.685 --> 06:20.018
when you see Merchison,

06:20.089 --> 06:23.650
just don't call her
"the white balloon" anymore.

06:23.726 --> 06:25.660
It hurts her feelings.

06:25.728 --> 06:30.028
- Okay, Joey.
- And don't let the guys call her that.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.035
I liked her.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.639
It's a promise,
Joey.

06:38.707 --> 06:40.766
Now, you be still.
You lay quiet.

06:40.843 --> 06:43.539
- Will.
- What?

06:43.612 --> 06:47.343
I'm really tired.

07:06.702 --> 07:08.636
I'm sorry, Joey.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.074
I'm sorry.

07:47.242 --> 07:50.109
I could see where
the Drac fighter went down.

07:50.179 --> 07:54.707
Its ejection capsule
couldn't be far from the wreck.

07:54.783 --> 07:57.581
I just hoped
it wasn't dead...

07:57.653 --> 07:59.587
yet.

08:05.127 --> 08:09.461
It's funny, but I'd never
actually seen a Drac.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.432
I knew they were
completely inhuman,

08:12.501 --> 08:14.833
not even male or female,

08:14.903 --> 08:20.034
but both, bundled together
in a scaly reptilian body.

15:56.376 --> 15:59.004
Burn, you mother!

15:59.079 --> 16:02.276
Burn! Ha!
Burn, sucker!

16:13.927 --> 16:16.521
You blew it, toad face!

16:38.551 --> 16:42.385
...Earthman.

17:03.611 --> 17:06.045
Hey, Drac, I'm hungry.

17:06.114 --> 17:08.877
Hungry.

17:08.950 --> 17:12.909
You understand that? Hungry, huh?

17:20.595 --> 17:23.723
Hey, you understand
any English, toad face?

17:40.345 --> 17:41.314
What?

17:44.817 --> 17:46.745
...Earthman.

17:47.489 --> 17:49.423
Stick it.

17:55.163 --> 17:57.723
So your name's Jerry Sheegan.
So what?

18:07.442 --> 18:09.376
Do you want to
know my name?

18:09.444 --> 18:13.403
Willis E. Davidge.

18:17.886 --> 18:21.322
How about some food?

18:21.389 --> 18:23.380
Some food.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.426
Give me some food!

18:27.062 --> 18:29.997
Fooood.

18:52.554 --> 18:56.081
Davidge?

19:00.562 --> 19:02.827
You're kidding.

19:53.448 --> 19:56.645
Drac!
Wake up, Drac!

19:56.718 --> 20:02.156
Wake up! Wake up!
Cut me loose!

20:02.223 --> 20:05.056
Help me! Meteors!

20:06.995 --> 20:08.929
Help me!

20:29.817 --> 20:32.047
Yeah, you said it.

21:57.903 --> 21:58.997
Drac!

21:59.073 --> 22:02.839
I could have killed you easy.
You owe me one.

22:02.910 --> 22:06.175
What did you say your name was?
Your name! Your name!

22:09.284 --> 22:12.447
All right. All right.

22:12.520 --> 22:18.186
Now, listen, Jerry.
Listen. Listen.

22:18.259 --> 22:21.990
Meteors fall here.

22:22.063 --> 22:25.794
Uh, shwoo! Shwoo!
Many meteors here.

22:25.867 --> 22:30.201
You understand meteors?

22:30.271 --> 22:34.139
Uh, zerki.
Zerki fall here.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.403
Zerki fall here,
many zerki.

22:36.477 --> 22:40.470
We're out in the open.

22:40.548 --> 22:45.008
If we stay here,
we, we die.

22:45.086 --> 22:47.077
- Die.
- Die.

22:47.155 --> 22:51.717
- Die.
- Yeah.

22:51.793 --> 22:54.057
What we got to do...

22:54.128 --> 22:57.393
is we got to take all...

22:57.465 --> 22:59.660
the goodies out of
that thing of yours.

22:59.734 --> 23:01.668
- Neesay.
- The neesay.

23:01.736 --> 23:03.601
- Nehsayyy!
- Nehsay!

23:03.671 --> 23:06.231
Yeah, nehsay.

23:06.307 --> 23:08.741
Get our butts
up higher in the forest.

23:08.810 --> 23:10.744
Up there.

23:10.812 --> 23:12.871
At least there's
some cover up there.

23:12.947 --> 23:14.881
Cover?
You know, cover?

23:14.949 --> 23:18.612
Earthman...

23:23.658 --> 23:25.717
Exactly.

23:27.995 --> 23:30.759
I'm glad you agree.

23:33.935 --> 23:36.631
Yeah, yeah.

23:43.811 --> 23:45.745
Next time, huh?

23:45.813 --> 23:48.907
I'll put that knife
right up your kazoo,

23:48.983 --> 23:50.917
if you got one.

24:03.498 --> 24:06.465
Okay, toad face.
You gonna shoot me?

24:06.599 --> 24:08.726
Go ahead, shoot me.

24:08.801 --> 24:11.634
Go on, shoot me! Go ahead.
Do it now! Shoot me!

24:11.704 --> 24:13.729
The point is, Draco,
whether we live or die.

24:13.806 --> 24:17.435
I don't love you, and you don't love me,
but we're stranded, understand?

24:17.510 --> 24:20.274
You get it or don't you
gavee English, huh?

24:30.022 --> 24:34.652
Yeah, poogah.
Write and tell my mother, you big frog.

24:34.727 --> 24:38.629
Look.

24:40.900 --> 24:45.269
We have to build
a shelter with stones.

24:45.337 --> 24:49.831
Shelter. You gavee?
Shelter?

24:53.179 --> 24:55.579
It was slow going.

24:55.648 --> 24:58.776
Since I had to communicate
with that lizard,

24:58.851 --> 25:02.412
I tried learning a few words
of its crude lingo.

25:02.488 --> 25:05.457
Hey, Drac.

25:05.524 --> 25:09.722
Drac, uh...

25:15.401 --> 25:17.767
Forget it.
Enough talk.

25:17.837 --> 25:20.931
Let's get on
with it, huh?

25:21.006 --> 25:22.940
Shit!

25:31.016 --> 25:34.975
Of course, the Drac was picking up
a few words of English, too.

25:35.054 --> 25:36.988
- Yeah!
- Shit!

25:38.524 --> 25:41.982
Shit? What do you
mean, shit?

25:42.061 --> 25:44.757
No solid.

25:45.831 --> 25:47.992
It's solid.
I'll show you.

25:52.571 --> 25:55.802
Huh? Ha ha!
Not solid.

26:16.896 --> 26:19.831
Left foot.

26:19.899 --> 26:23.232
Right foot.

26:23.302 --> 26:27.363
This is my left foot.

26:28.574 --> 26:32.408
This is my right foot.

26:33.746 --> 26:37.204
And this am
both my feet.

26:37.283 --> 26:40.514
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah, great.

26:40.586 --> 26:43.350
This is my head.

26:43.422 --> 26:45.686
That is
your ugly head.

26:45.758 --> 26:49.285
No, no.
This is my head.

26:49.361 --> 26:54.162
That is you head.
You ugly head.

27:02.007 --> 27:03.941
Ha ha.

27:04.009 --> 27:09.879
That is Davidge's ugly head.

27:09.949 --> 27:12.281
All right,
that's enough!

27:12.351 --> 27:14.717
You keep that up and you can learn
English all by yourself...

27:14.787 --> 27:17.153
because I'm not gonna be
your teacher anymore.

27:17.223 --> 27:20.886
Sorry, Davidge.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.053
That's better.

27:23.128 --> 27:28.156
You know, while you're having
such a good time and doing nothing,

27:28.234 --> 27:32.295
I am trying to think of ways
to improve our situation.

27:32.371 --> 27:35.363
- Okay.
- You know the old saying,

27:35.441 --> 27:37.773
if at first
you don't succeed,

27:37.843 --> 27:41.074
try, try again.

27:41.146 --> 27:46.311
Davidge, you learn this
from great Drac teacher, Shismar?

27:46.385 --> 27:49.445
No, from Mickey Mouse.

27:49.521 --> 27:54.823
- Who?
- Mickey Mous-s-s-se.

27:54.893 --> 27:57.157
Mickey Mouse.

27:57.229 --> 28:00.164
Is this
great Earthman teacher?

28:01.867 --> 28:05.928
Yeah. Sort of.

28:06.005 --> 28:09.270
Shine its
ever-lovin' light on me

28:09.341 --> 28:12.504
Let the midnight special

28:12.578 --> 28:15.672
Shine its light on me

28:15.748 --> 28:19.013
Let the midnight special...

28:21.487 --> 28:23.546
Forget it.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.840
Mmm! Delish.
Have one.

29:27.619 --> 29:30.349
Don't forget you helped me
acquire the taste.

29:31.757 --> 29:36.524
Besides, I'm going to
improve the menu.

29:36.595 --> 29:42.431
Soon we picked up...
one side or other side.

29:42.501 --> 29:45.231
What, with the war
going on?

29:45.304 --> 29:48.102
We got more chance
of catching a Greyhound bus.

29:48.173 --> 29:53.406
Humans,
easy you give up.

29:53.479 --> 29:56.277
Shismar teaches us...

29:56.348 --> 30:00.182
intelligent life
takes a stand.

30:02.252 --> 30:04.120
Where did you get that crap?

30:04.189 --> 30:06.316
Out of that little book
you're always reading?

30:06.392 --> 30:08.485
I'm the one
that's taking a stand.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.791
Remember, I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you sons of Shitmat.

30:11.864 --> 30:13.729
Shismar!

30:13.799 --> 30:15.733
Yeah, whatever.

30:15.801 --> 30:18.793
This war begun by you,
by humans!

30:18.871 --> 30:21.305
You know something,
Jerry?

30:21.373 --> 30:23.432
Your great Shismar
ain't shit.

30:26.245 --> 30:28.372
Earthman,

30:28.447 --> 30:34.215
your Mickey Mouse
is one big stupid dope!

30:43.162 --> 30:45.790
Yea! Meat!

30:45.864 --> 30:49.095
Stay there, you mother!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Aha!

30:55.340 --> 30:59.606
You dirty rotten
son of a bitch!

31:03.749 --> 31:06.309
Shit.

31:13.692 --> 31:16.661
Hey.
Hey, God dang it!

31:18.096 --> 31:20.029
Hey.

31:53.930 --> 31:56.364
Get out of here!

31:57.767 --> 32:00.292
No! Jerry!

32:01.638 --> 32:05.904
Jerry!
Jerry!

32:05.975 --> 32:08.967
Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry!

32:09.045 --> 32:12.139
Jerry!
Aah!

32:12.215 --> 32:16.049
Aah! Jerry!

32:16.119 --> 32:19.350
Jerry!

32:19.422 --> 32:21.754
Aah!

32:21.824 --> 32:24.918
Jerry! Oh!

32:24.994 --> 32:27.724
Oh, God! Oh, God!

32:27.797 --> 32:31.563
Jerry! Help!

32:33.236 --> 32:35.067
Get it!

33:04.534 --> 33:08.595
Thank you.
Thank you.

33:12.809 --> 33:14.743
Go ahead.

33:18.481 --> 33:20.915
Aah! Aah, God!

33:26.656 --> 33:30.319
You saved my life.

33:30.393 --> 33:33.988
- Why?
- Maybe...

33:34.063 --> 33:38.124
I need to look
at another face...

33:38.201 --> 33:42.103
even as ugly
as yours.

33:42.171 --> 33:44.765
So you still think
humans are ugly, huh?

33:44.841 --> 33:49.175
Compared to a Drac,
very ugly.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.605
But that thing
out there...

33:53.683 --> 33:56.083
was even more ugly
than you.

33:56.152 --> 34:01.146
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

34:16.272 --> 34:18.206
Ha! That's it!

34:19.942 --> 34:22.467
Even that thing under the ground
couldn't bite through this.

34:22.545 --> 34:24.478
I bet these shells
are meteorproof.

34:26.547 --> 34:27.880
They're meteorproof!

34:27.949 --> 34:31.351
- What?
- Zerkiproof! Zerkiproof!

34:38.561 --> 34:42.793
- Where would you be without me, huh?
- Back home.

34:51.607 --> 34:54.667
Ah, shit!

34:56.411 --> 34:58.607
Hey, Professor,

34:58.681 --> 35:00.672
how about
a little help, huh?

35:07.089 --> 35:10.684
Don't you ever get tired
of reading that book?

35:11.861 --> 35:13.795
No.

35:15.832 --> 35:18.357
Well, what's in it,
anyway?

35:18.434 --> 35:21.130
Things.

35:21.204 --> 35:23.195
Oh, for Christ's sake!

35:25.942 --> 35:29.776
It is called talmon.

35:29.846 --> 35:34.180
It contains the words
of our great teacher, Shismar.

35:34.250 --> 35:39.017
I suppose you have to know
the Drac language to read it, right?

35:39.088 --> 35:41.022
It would help.

35:41.090 --> 35:44.787
So teach me
the Drac language.

35:46.596 --> 35:49.030
It is not
for you, Davidge.

35:49.098 --> 35:51.896
Shismar is too good
for us humans, is that it?

35:51.968 --> 35:55.131
Not too good for humans,
but too good for you.

35:55.204 --> 35:56.762
Now you're
a judge of character.

35:56.839 --> 35:59.364
Do you not remember
what you say about Shismar?

35:59.442 --> 36:01.774
Well, maybe you forgot
what you said about Mickey Mouse!

36:03.846 --> 36:05.780
That was wrong.

36:08.117 --> 36:11.814
I did not mean it.

36:18.127 --> 36:21.153
I didn't mean what I said
about Shismar, either.

36:40.082 --> 36:42.550
Jerry,
what, what are you...

36:45.688 --> 36:51.422
This book must be given
to the pupil.

36:53.062 --> 36:58.125
I then become
the master.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.864
I am not worthy,
but there is no one else here.

37:33.302 --> 37:37.432
Time passed, as time does.

37:40.776 --> 37:45.440
We ate, we slept.

37:47.483 --> 37:50.418
And sometimes I listened
to the skies...

37:50.486 --> 37:53.387
for some faint hope
of rescue.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.882
In the meantime,

38:20.950 --> 38:24.598
I studied its language
and read its talmon.

38:42.483 --> 38:44.951
Translate.

38:45.019 --> 38:50.355
"If one receives evil
from another,

38:50.424 --> 38:54.588
"let one not
do evil in return.

38:55.663 --> 39:01.295
"Rather,
let him extend love...

39:01.368 --> 39:03.302
"to the enemy,

39:03.370 --> 39:07.431
that love
might unite them."

39:07.508 --> 39:10.739
I've heard
all this before...

39:10.811 --> 39:12.745
in the human Talmon.

39:12.813 --> 39:15.407
Of course you have.

39:15.482 --> 39:18.042
Truth is truth.

39:19.386 --> 39:21.320
But what you have
not yet learned...

39:21.388 --> 39:26.087
is the way we Dracs
express the truth.

39:27.861 --> 39:33.595
The words of Shismar
must be sung.

40:15.609 --> 40:18.510
Jerry!

40:31.692 --> 40:33.626
Let's go!

40:45.906 --> 40:48.636
Come on, Jerry,
move it!

40:53.380 --> 40:55.473
Run!

41:02.122 --> 41:04.488
Get up!
Get up, damn you!

41:11.498 --> 41:16.197
- What do I have to do, carry you?
- I am sorry.

41:16.270 --> 41:18.329
We live
like cannibals.

41:18.405 --> 41:21.499
You get so fat,
you can barely move.

41:21.575 --> 41:23.907
You'll never conquer the universe
in that state.

41:23.977 --> 41:28.175
Conquer the universe?
We were here 1,000 years before you!

41:28.248 --> 41:30.739
Well, in case you haven't heard,
Drac face,

41:30.818 --> 41:33.252
we legally annexed
this star system.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.585
- You invaded this star system!
- Bullshit!

41:36.657 --> 41:38.591
You're the invaders.

41:38.659 --> 41:41.685
No. We are explorers.
We are founders of worlds!

41:43.097 --> 41:46.430
What do you think we are,
Drac face, homebodies?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.900
We've settled twice as
many worlds than you.

41:48.969 --> 41:51.870
Exactly.
You spread like a disease.

41:51.939 --> 41:54.464
Then what the hell are you
going to do about it, huh?

41:54.541 --> 41:57.101
You'll see what we do
about it, Earthman. We fight.

41:57.177 --> 41:59.304
Some fighter you are.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.178
You wouldn't last a week without me.

42:02.249 --> 42:04.877
You owe your miserable
existence to me.

42:04.952 --> 42:06.579
We'll see
about that!

42:08.555 --> 42:13.083
Get out of my shelter! Get out!
Get out! Get out of my shelter!

42:13.160 --> 42:16.061
You son of a bitch!
It's my shelter!

42:16.130 --> 42:19.293
I built it!

42:22.236 --> 42:25.797
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you, you bastard!

42:25.873 --> 42:28.239
I'll kill you!

42:31.311 --> 42:34.439
I'll kill you!

43:03.544 --> 43:05.478
Jerry...

43:07.915 --> 43:10.679
I think we're
starting to go crazy.

43:15.055 --> 43:19.958
What we have to do,
we have to start moving.

43:23.964 --> 43:26.956
Do you think we really
are alone out here?

43:29.169 --> 43:33.572
Of course
we are alone.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.574
I don't know.

43:39.646 --> 43:42.513
I had that dream again.

43:45.252 --> 43:48.221
There's this big ship
in my dream.

43:50.657 --> 43:53.421
It's so loud,
I wake up.

43:56.230 --> 43:59.358
And then
I can still hear it.

43:59.433 --> 44:02.402
It was a dream.

44:02.469 --> 44:04.403
I don't know.

44:07.474 --> 44:09.408
Maybe.

44:12.446 --> 44:15.745
But I do know
if we stay here, we die.

44:15.816 --> 44:19.843
Sooner or later,
we'll die.

44:22.055 --> 44:25.684
If this planet don't kill us,
we're gonna kill each other.

44:35.435 --> 44:40.134
You sure you won't
come with me, huh?

44:40.207 --> 44:44.075
Davidge,
I stay here.

44:45.979 --> 44:49.278
I have no interest
in your dreams.

44:53.787 --> 44:56.722
Any chance is better
than no chance.

45:01.194 --> 45:03.822
Come on, Jerry.
You're just being stubborn.

45:05.599 --> 45:09.660
No, I am not
just being...

45:09.736 --> 45:11.727
stubborn.

45:17.411 --> 45:19.345
If I find help...

45:21.815 --> 45:23.749
I'll come back for you.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.356
And if you do not?

45:31.192 --> 45:33.126
Then I guess we both die.

45:36.631 --> 45:38.724
Alone.

45:43.038 --> 45:44.972
I'll see you later.

48:10.852 --> 48:12.786
Hello!

48:14.122 --> 48:16.056
Anybody!

48:38.012 --> 48:40.913
Core samples.

48:40.982 --> 48:43.883
They're core samples.

49:13.615 --> 49:16.675
Scavengers.

49:26.870 --> 49:30.567
What I'd been hearing at night
was the scavenger ship.

49:30.640 --> 49:35.407
The scavengers were human...
barely human.

49:35.478 --> 49:39.847
They were outlaw miners who raped
whole planets for precious ores.

49:39.916 --> 49:44.114
They hunted Dracs for slave labor
so we tolerated them.

49:44.187 --> 49:47.623
I could only hope
they'd found nothing.

49:47.690 --> 49:50.853
I had no idea
what I was going to say to Jerry.

50:08.945 --> 50:11.743
Davidge...

50:11.814 --> 50:15.978
how cold do you think
it's going to get?

50:16.052 --> 50:17.986
I don't know.

50:19.489 --> 50:21.684
I guess we'll find out.

50:26.863 --> 50:30.026
I am happy
you came back.

50:32.869 --> 50:34.803
Jerry?

50:34.871 --> 50:36.896
Hey, Jerry,
what's wrong?

50:39.208 --> 50:43.736
I could not go with you.

50:45.748 --> 50:49.809
It is no longer
my life that matters.

50:51.421 --> 50:54.549
I am not fat.

50:54.624 --> 50:56.888
I am not lazy.

51:05.668 --> 51:07.693
Davidge.

51:09.305 --> 51:13.799
I await a new...

51:13.876 --> 51:15.867
life.

51:17.547 --> 51:22.007
A new life?
From where?

51:29.993 --> 51:33.986
Oh, my God.

51:34.063 --> 51:37.430
Oh, my God?
Are you telling me you're pregnant?

51:38.635 --> 51:41.604
You're going to
have a baby?

51:41.671 --> 51:44.799
A little Drac?

51:53.483 --> 51:56.145
But how?

51:56.219 --> 51:57.744
Well, don't look at me!

52:06.229 --> 52:09.062
Jerry, you can't
do this to me.

52:11.234 --> 52:15.034
With you humans,

52:15.104 --> 52:18.267
birth is
a matter of choice.

52:18.341 --> 52:24.177
With us Dracs,
it happens.

52:24.247 --> 52:27.080
When the time comes,

52:27.150 --> 52:30.210
it just happens.

52:31.487 --> 52:36.948
That is why
I could not go with you.

52:37.026 --> 52:40.518
My child is all...

52:40.596 --> 52:43.326
I have now.

52:50.339 --> 52:53.331
Davidge, tell me.

52:53.409 --> 52:57.345
What... did you find...

52:57.413 --> 53:01.611
out there?

53:03.419 --> 53:05.353
Nothing.

53:09.292 --> 53:12.386
Like you said,
it was just a dream.

53:43.192 --> 53:46.025
Zammis. Hmm?

53:46.829 --> 53:48.763
Zammis?

53:54.070 --> 53:56.004
Zammis.

54:00.610 --> 54:02.544
Soon.

55:35.905 --> 55:38.635
Jerry!

55:52.722 --> 55:55.213
Jerry! Jerry!

55:59.962 --> 56:02.021
Jerry, look out!

56:16.946 --> 56:19.210
I can't see!
I can't see!

56:19.282 --> 56:21.216
Over here!

56:21.284 --> 56:23.809
Help me!

56:26.322 --> 56:29.985
Come on, Jerry.
Don't you quit on me.

56:30.059 --> 56:32.653
- Tell me about Zammis.
- Zammis?

56:32.728 --> 56:35.492
What kind of name
is Zammis?

56:35.564 --> 56:39.694
There are five names
in a Drac's lineage.

56:39.769 --> 56:43.865
I am Sheegan.
Before me was Gathic.

56:43.940 --> 56:48.001
And before Gathic
was Islane.

56:49.645 --> 56:52.113
Come on,
keep talking.

56:52.181 --> 56:55.082
Before Islane was Tighe.

56:55.151 --> 56:59.178
Before Tighe was Zammis.

56:59.255 --> 57:02.349
Up there. Look!

57:11.674 --> 57:16.168
One day I must
stand with Zammis...

57:16.246 --> 57:20.546
before the holy council
on Dracon...

57:20.617 --> 57:23.347
and recite our lineage...

57:23.419 --> 57:26.479
so that Zammis may join...

57:26.556 --> 57:29.753
the society
of all Dracs.

58:12.702 --> 58:15.102
You wanna eat?

58:17.473 --> 58:19.805
I can't.

58:19.876 --> 58:21.810
Maybe we should open up
a little place here.

58:21.878 --> 58:25.541
I could ruin the food.

58:25.615 --> 58:28.175
You could frighten
the customers.

58:46.903 --> 58:48.837
Davidge.

58:53.242 --> 58:56.336
I will teach you
the Farebeat line.

58:57.780 --> 59:00.408
Before or after
breakfast?

59:01.751 --> 59:05.209
It is an honor
I offer you.

59:06.189 --> 59:09.317
I'm sorry.

59:09.392 --> 59:12.520
Right now just staying alive
is honor enough, huh?

59:13.696 --> 59:15.630
All right.

59:15.698 --> 59:18.633
I will learn
your lineage.

59:20.203 --> 59:25.505
Let us begin
with your parents.

59:25.575 --> 59:27.509
Who were they?

59:29.712 --> 59:32.545
My dad's
name's Carl.

59:34.584 --> 59:37.644
My mom's
name's, uh...

59:37.720 --> 59:39.779
Dolores.

59:40.857 --> 59:43.189
Their deeds?

59:43.259 --> 59:49.027
Well, Dad works for a company
that makes computers.

59:50.099 --> 59:53.034
And my mom,

59:53.102 --> 59:55.263
she used to be
a waitress.

59:55.338 --> 01:00:00.298
- Waitress.
- Yeah, before they got married.

01:00:00.376 --> 01:00:02.401
And their parents?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.439
We used to visit my grandpa
when I was just a kid.

01:00:08.518 --> 01:00:12.113
He had this place
out in the country.

01:00:12.188 --> 01:00:16.124
I think
he was a farmer.

01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:18.126
And, uh...

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:21.425
Grandma was just
a good cook.

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:27.101
Oh.
That is your lineage.

01:00:28.638 --> 01:00:32.597
Here stands before you...

01:00:32.675 --> 01:00:37.578
Willis E. Davidge.

01:00:37.647 --> 01:00:39.672
Fighter pilot.

01:00:39.749 --> 01:00:43.879
Son of Dolores,

01:00:43.953 --> 01:00:47.980
who used to be
a waitress.

01:00:48.057 --> 01:00:50.116
And Carl,

01:00:50.193 --> 01:00:52.661
maker of computers,

01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:57.665
who in their time
were born of Grandpa,

01:00:57.733 --> 01:00:59.667
possibly a farmer.

01:00:59.735 --> 01:01:02.363
And Grandma,

01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:04.963
good cook.

01:01:07.677 --> 01:01:10.874
You make it sound
pretty thin.

01:01:10.947 --> 01:01:16.613
It is thin.
But I am honored...

01:01:16.686 --> 01:01:18.620
that you
entrusted it to me.

01:01:18.688 --> 01:01:22.818
My own lineage
is very rich, Davidge.

01:01:22.892 --> 01:01:25.360
Learn it from me.

01:01:25.428 --> 01:01:29.125
Allow me to do you
this honor.

01:01:29.198 --> 01:01:33.635
It will be
a good gift between us.

01:02:36.699 --> 01:02:40.465
Jerry went on
singing its lineage,

01:02:40.536 --> 01:02:42.561
back to the founding
of its home planet...

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:46.631
170 generations ago.

01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:49.837
To keep Jerry happy
as the winter raged on,

01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:53.075
I, too, learned to sing
the Farebeat line.

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:07.092
What's wrong?

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:11.489
Zammis...

01:03:11.567 --> 01:03:13.501
is coming.

01:03:13.569 --> 01:03:16.436
Oh, God.

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:18.439
God.

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:20.805
What do I do?

01:03:20.876 --> 01:03:22.810
I don't know.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.049
Something...
is wrong!

01:03:29.118 --> 01:03:31.882
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:35.048
You're gonna be all right.

01:03:35.124 --> 01:03:37.456
The women always get
nervous before labor.

01:03:37.526 --> 01:03:40.324
I am not a woman.

01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:42.887
Oh, but pregnant
people...

01:03:42.965 --> 01:03:45.203
Things get nervous.

01:03:45.337 --> 01:03:47.897
Everybody gets nervous
before labor.

01:03:47.973 --> 01:03:50.168
Besides, I mean,
if anything happened to you,

01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:55.043
I'd be left here
all alone. Huh?

01:03:55.113 --> 01:03:59.140
Just because business
has been a little slow lately,

01:03:59.217 --> 01:04:01.913
you expect me to run
the whole place alone?

01:04:06.892 --> 01:04:09.759
You are alone.

01:04:11.863 --> 01:04:15.822
Within yourself,
you are alone.

01:04:17.903 --> 01:04:21.339
That is why you humans...

01:04:21.406 --> 01:04:24.341
have separated your sexes...

01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:28.846
into two separate halves,

01:04:28.914 --> 01:04:34.079
for the joy
of that brief...

01:04:34.152 --> 01:04:36.086
union.

01:04:38.924 --> 01:04:43.588
You don't know diddly-poop
about humans.

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:46.859
Do you think just because you Dracs
got a lineage 200 miles long,

01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:49.799
you can blah, blah this name
and blah, blah that name?

01:04:50.868 --> 01:04:52.666
Jerry! Jerry!

01:04:52.737 --> 01:04:55.865
Jerry?

01:04:55.941 --> 01:04:57.966
Jerry?

01:04:58.043 --> 01:05:00.375
Davidge.

01:05:02.948 --> 01:05:05.212
Listen to me.

01:05:07.385 --> 01:05:09.319
You...

01:05:09.387 --> 01:05:12.322
must be a parent...

01:05:14.226 --> 01:05:16.160
for Zammis.

01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:18.822
Don't kid around,
Jerry.

01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:21.866
What do we do now?

01:05:21.933 --> 01:05:24.834
You...

01:05:24.903 --> 01:05:27.872
must take my place.

01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:33.334
When the time comes...

01:05:35.914 --> 01:05:39.350
you must find a way...

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:41.851
to take Zammis...

01:05:43.922 --> 01:05:46.390
back home...

01:05:48.426 --> 01:05:52.362
you must stand
beside Zammis...

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:55.866
before the holy council...

01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:59.869
of Dracon...

01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:02.372
and recite...

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.806
its lineage.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.712
You must, Davidge.

01:06:14.386 --> 01:06:18.823
Swear this to me.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.824
Shut up.

01:06:20.892 --> 01:06:24.055
Keep pushing.
Do whatever you do.

01:06:24.129 --> 01:06:27.997
You must...

01:06:28.066 --> 01:06:32.162
take Zammis to Dracon.

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:36.707
Swear.

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:39.744
- No!
- Swear.

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:43.643
Swear.

01:06:45.417 --> 01:06:47.851
All right.

01:06:47.919 --> 01:06:50.479
All right,
I swear it.

01:06:51.923 --> 01:06:54.187
I swear it.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.923
Just don't
die on me.

01:07:00.932 --> 01:07:02.866
Now...

01:07:04.436 --> 01:07:07.496
you must open me.

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:19.977
Here.

01:07:21.953 --> 01:07:24.888
This place.

01:07:26.191 --> 01:07:31.060
Don't be afraid,
my friend.

01:07:31.129 --> 01:07:33.063
I can't!

01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:36.066
Then you... must...

01:07:36.134 --> 01:07:39.069
want... to...

01:07:39.137 --> 01:07:41.401
have this war.

01:07:43.475 --> 01:07:46.911
You... have...

01:07:46.978 --> 01:07:48.912
s-s...

01:08:06.598 --> 01:08:08.532
No.

01:08:09.667 --> 01:08:11.601
Jerry.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.738
Oh, please.

01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:29.873
Gosh, Jerry,

01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:33.877
what am I supposed
to do now, huh?

01:10:37.515 --> 01:10:40.211
You taught me
all about the Talmon,

01:10:40.285 --> 01:10:43.379
the line of Jareeba,

01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:47.288
but you didn't say nothing
about taking care of baby Dracs.

01:10:47.358 --> 01:10:49.599
So long, Jerry!

01:10:57.439 --> 01:11:00.374
Oh, all right.

01:11:00.442 --> 01:11:04.378
Ok, we're going to
try it again, huh?

01:11:04.446 --> 01:11:07.244
Come on, doll.
Come on.

01:11:07.316 --> 01:11:09.682
Eat. Come on.

01:11:09.752 --> 01:11:14.451
Zammis.
Zammis, come on.

01:11:14.523 --> 01:11:16.650
Come on.

01:11:16.725 --> 01:11:18.659
What am I
supposed to do,

01:11:18.727 --> 01:11:22.925
run down to the market
for Gerber baby Drac food?

01:11:22.998 --> 01:11:24.932
This is all there is,
pal.

01:11:27.236 --> 01:11:29.170
Watch.
Watch me. Watch.

01:11:29.238 --> 01:11:31.297
Hmm? Hmm? Mmm!

01:11:31.373 --> 01:11:35.332
Come on. Okay.

01:11:35.411 --> 01:11:38.744
Come here. Like this.
Come on.

01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:41.442
See if you like that.
Do you like that?

01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:43.509
Huh? Huh?

01:11:44.587 --> 01:11:48.546
Come on, kid.
Yes, that's it!

01:11:48.624 --> 01:11:51.957
That's it. Chew it now.
There you go.

01:11:52.027 --> 01:11:56.054
Hey, squirt!
Let's fly, huh?

01:12:55.658 --> 01:12:58.923
I guess he was
an ugly little cuss,

01:12:58.994 --> 01:13:01.224
but no uglier than the pictures
of those other kids...

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:03.857
that used to be
shown around the mess hall.

01:13:09.738 --> 01:13:14.675
Of course, he grew slightly
faster than a human child.

01:13:16.945 --> 01:13:19.004
I'm going to start
calling you beanstalk.

01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:21.948
You outgrow your clothes faster
than I can even catch them.

01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:26.479
Don't spread
your fingers.

01:13:26.555 --> 01:13:29.080
Fingers?

01:13:29.158 --> 01:13:31.388
Yeah, these.
Fingers.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.758
Cattuh. Fingers.

01:13:36.965 --> 01:13:40.298
They're not the same.

01:13:40.369 --> 01:13:45.238
Well, of course
they're not the same.

01:13:45.307 --> 01:13:48.242
You're a Drac,
I'm a human.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:50.835
Look, look, uh...

01:13:50.913 --> 01:13:53.677
now, you have
three fingers.

01:13:53.749 --> 01:13:55.944
One, two, three.

01:13:56.018 --> 01:13:59.454
Now, I have
five fingers.

01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:02.547
One, two, three,

01:14:02.624 --> 01:14:05.422
four, five.

01:14:05.494 --> 01:14:09.157
Zammis get four five?

01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:12.800
No.

01:14:12.868 --> 01:14:14.802
You're a Drac,

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.929
and I'm a human.

01:14:17.005 --> 01:14:19.565
Human?

01:14:20.776 --> 01:14:24.872
Yeah, um...
human is me.

01:14:24.947 --> 01:14:26.881
Drac is you.

01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:31.818
Now, I'm a human because
my parents were human,

01:14:31.887 --> 01:14:36.824
and your parent
was a Drac,

01:14:36.892 --> 01:14:39.417
so you are a Drac.

01:14:39.495 --> 01:14:42.555
- Got it?
- I'm a Drac!

01:14:42.631 --> 01:14:45.759
Yeah!
Yeah, great.

01:15:09.858 --> 01:15:11.826
Uncle!

01:15:15.364 --> 01:15:19.425
Uncle, wait!
Wait!

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.774
Huh? Uncle.

01:15:26.842 --> 01:15:29.902
- What was that?
- Spacecraft.

01:15:29.978 --> 01:15:32.811
- Were there humans inside?
- I don't know!

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:34.815
I'm going to
go find out!

01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:37.215
Uncle, please,
can I come?

01:15:37.286 --> 01:15:39.345
No! Stay here
until I get back.

01:15:39.421 --> 01:15:42.322
Uncle, why are you afraid?
Uncle, please!

01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:44.382
No! You stay
inside the cave!

01:16:45.954 --> 01:16:50.288
So, that's why when
we walk or we hunt,

01:16:50.359 --> 01:16:54.295
we always go in the direction
of the rising of the sun.

01:16:54.363 --> 01:16:56.627
Never in the direction
of the setting of the sun.

01:16:56.698 --> 01:16:58.666
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

01:16:58.734 --> 01:17:01.202
Because if those men
ever find us...

01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:06.841
we'll never see
each other again.

01:17:06.909 --> 01:17:08.843
But, Uncle,

01:17:08.911 --> 01:17:10.845
they're humans,

01:17:10.913 --> 01:17:12.847
like you.

01:17:14.416 --> 01:17:17.351
Shut up and eat.

01:17:19.988 --> 01:17:23.446
I tried not to think
about the scavengers.

01:17:23.525 --> 01:17:27.188
Instead, I concentrated
on Zammis.

01:17:27.262 --> 01:17:31.358
I finally figured it was time
to start his education.

01:17:31.433 --> 01:17:33.628
The name of this game,
Zammis...

01:17:36.238 --> 01:17:38.468
- Is football.
- Football.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.068
Now, these trees are
my defensive line.

01:17:43.145 --> 01:17:46.444
Those trees over there
are your team.

01:17:46.515 --> 01:17:49.973
They're a bigger than real players,
like the Houston Oilers,

01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:53.385
and a little bit slower,
but not much, all right?

01:17:53.455 --> 01:17:55.855
You go down to that end
of the field.

01:17:55.924 --> 01:17:58.810
That's your end zone.
Okay? Go on.

01:17:58.944 --> 01:18:00.775
Hey-o!

01:18:00.846 --> 01:18:05.579
All right, now,
when I kick the ball to you,

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:09.245
you catch it and you try to
run past me, if you can,

01:18:09.321 --> 01:18:11.255
through these
two guys there.

01:18:11.323 --> 01:18:13.791
That's your goal line.
You got it?

01:18:13.859 --> 01:18:16.384
- No.
- Just do what I tell you.

01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:18.395
It'll be fine.
All right?

01:18:18.463 --> 01:18:21.261
All right?
Here comes the kickoff.

01:18:28.106 --> 01:18:31.371
Pick it up!
Pick it up! Now run!

01:18:31.443 --> 01:18:34.412
Now run. Run!
Come on! Go!

01:18:38.216 --> 01:18:41.515
Zammis has got the ball! Look at him
weaving through that defense!

01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:46.623
Davidge has got
the ball!

01:18:51.997 --> 01:18:54.761
Oh!
At the 20-yard line.

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:14.084
I like this game.

01:19:14.152 --> 01:19:16.086
It's a great game.

01:19:16.154 --> 01:19:20.113
You don't normally get to eat the ball.
That's a bonus.

01:19:20.192 --> 01:19:23.889
I've simplified the rules
for the conditions here.

01:19:23.962 --> 01:19:26.863
Small teams and so on.

01:19:33.805 --> 01:19:36.103
I've been thinking, Uncle,

01:19:36.174 --> 01:19:38.972
about those humans
you saw.

01:19:39.044 --> 01:19:41.274
Maybe they are friends
with the Dracs.

01:19:42.681 --> 01:19:45.206
Maybe they asked them
to come and work.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.352
I wish
that was true.

01:19:54.192 --> 01:19:57.628
I have never
seen a Drac,

01:19:57.696 --> 01:20:01.223
only my own face
in the water.

01:20:01.299 --> 01:20:05.201
I wish I was not a Drac.

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:08.467
I wish I had your face.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.839
Oh, Zammis.

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.243
I wish I had
five fingers.

01:20:15.313 --> 01:20:18.510
Oh, Zammis.
Listen to me.

01:20:20.285 --> 01:20:25.746
As Dracs go, you are
a great-looking kid.

01:20:27.192 --> 01:20:29.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:29.561 --> 01:20:32.121
It's just that...

01:20:32.197 --> 01:20:35.132
you've never seen
your own kind.

01:20:36.334 --> 01:20:38.268
Now, someday,

01:20:38.336 --> 01:20:41.669
you're going to
go home,

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.038
and you're gonna forget all about
this god-awful planet...

01:20:44.109 --> 01:20:46.100
and all about me.

01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:49.908
I will never
forget you, Uncle.

01:20:51.683 --> 01:20:54.174
No, I guess
you won't.

01:20:56.788 --> 01:20:59.757
I won't
forget you either.

01:21:02.527 --> 01:21:04.791
Uncle?

01:21:05.964 --> 01:21:09.229
What was
my parent like?

01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:11.235
Zammis...

01:21:14.139 --> 01:21:16.073
your parent...

01:21:18.143 --> 01:21:20.976
was my friend.

01:21:23.315 --> 01:21:25.249
Hey, Zammis.

01:21:28.653 --> 01:21:30.587
Hey, Zammis.

01:21:33.158 --> 01:21:35.092
Hey, Zammis!

01:21:41.666 --> 01:21:43.600
Oh, no.

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:48.104
Hey, Zammis!

01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:13.695
All right,
move it now.

01:22:16.368 --> 01:22:19.166
Zammis!

01:22:27.512 --> 01:22:31.141
Zammis!

01:22:39.257 --> 01:22:41.919
Hey, Johnny, look here.

01:22:41.993 --> 01:22:44.484
A fine little woggie,
if I ever saw one.

01:22:44.562 --> 01:22:48.464
Surprise, surprise.
Looks a bit stringy to me, though.

01:22:53.638 --> 01:22:56.539
No, he's just fine.
Tough as nails.

01:22:56.608 --> 01:22:58.202
A born worker.

01:22:59.277 --> 01:23:01.577
Ah, you pathetic little bugger!

01:23:03.648 --> 01:23:06.208
Run about!
Run about!

01:23:10.889 --> 01:23:13.016
How do you suppose
he got here?

01:23:13.091 --> 01:23:18.586
Aah! Let's have a look.
See if his daddy's around.

01:23:18.663 --> 01:23:21.598
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:23:26.404 --> 01:23:28.929
Hey, you slimy bastard!

01:23:32.944 --> 01:23:36.402
God damn, he's got you
hot and bothered!

01:23:36.481 --> 01:23:40.747
Don't worry.
I'll slow him down for you.

01:23:51.696 --> 01:23:56.395
You ripped my face, you slimy
little Drac! I'll make you pay.

01:23:56.468 --> 01:23:58.561
Uncle!

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:00.729
- Who the hell are you?
- Let him go!

01:24:00.805 --> 01:24:04.036
- Uncle!
- Zammis, no!

01:24:05.376 --> 01:24:07.901
Uncle!

01:24:14.719 --> 01:24:17.119
Uncle!

01:25:06.304 --> 01:25:11.367
We entrust our brother
to God's merciful keeping,

01:25:11.442 --> 01:25:15.811
and we commit his body
to space.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.280
From ashes to ashes,

01:25:18.349 --> 01:25:22.445
from dust to dust...

01:25:26.124 --> 01:25:28.058
Jesus Christ!

01:25:28.126 --> 01:25:30.184
Didn't they just
fix that thing?

01:25:30.318 --> 01:25:32.479
Oh, shit.
Who's listening, anyway?

01:25:33.621 --> 01:25:35.555
Next.

01:25:35.623 --> 01:25:38.490
"Gavorki, George W.
Agnostic."

01:25:38.559 --> 01:25:41.357
No music.

01:25:43.765 --> 01:25:45.995
So long.

01:25:47.201 --> 01:25:49.135
Next.

01:25:52.306 --> 01:25:55.002
Where's the damn tag
on this one?

01:25:55.076 --> 01:25:57.510
Those jerks in prep
are really getting sloppy.

01:25:57.578 --> 01:25:59.478
So, have a look
inside.

01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:05.516
Look at this poor freak.

01:26:05.586 --> 01:26:07.178
At least
he's in one piece.

01:26:07.255 --> 01:26:09.723
Some guys have
all the luck.

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:13.124
- Nope, no tag.
- We'll give him a John Doe.

01:26:13.194 --> 01:26:15.128
Protestant.

01:26:16.564 --> 01:26:18.225
- Hold it!
- What?

01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:26.569
Go ahead,
take it.

01:27:06.747 --> 01:27:10.615
Zammis...

01:27:13.454 --> 01:27:17.049
Jesus,
he speaks Drac.

01:27:44.318 --> 01:27:47.481
Three years.

01:27:50.491 --> 01:27:52.652
Where the hell
has he been?

01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:55.560
That's Will, turning up
when you least expect him.

01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:41.200
He was found on the fourth planet
of the Fyrine system,

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:45.769
where he just might have been working
for the other side.

01:28:45.846 --> 01:28:49.782
Are you crazy?
That's Will Davidge in there

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:52.011
Davidge!

01:28:52.086 --> 01:28:56.147
I will die!
I will die!

01:28:56.223 --> 01:28:58.157
I don't know
how long I lay there...

01:28:58.225 --> 01:29:00.819
before the surveillance team
picked me up.

01:29:00.895 --> 01:29:02.829
They thought I was dead.

01:29:02.897 --> 01:29:06.526
Well, the medics have had time
to nail me back together.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.534
Now I've got to go back.

01:29:08.602 --> 01:29:10.001
Will!

01:29:10.071 --> 01:29:14.633
- Hold it!
- I'm going, with or without your help.

01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:17.269
No way.
I'm sorry.

01:29:17.345 --> 01:29:21.372
We put our asses on the line for you.
You owe us for that.

01:29:21.449 --> 01:29:24.577
I can't let you go, Will.

01:29:29.223 --> 01:29:32.590
Never mind. Let him go
if he wants to be an asshole.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.729
Hello, pilot. Please identify.

01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:44.032
Davidge, Willis E.
Got to log a couple of hours.

01:29:46.574 --> 01:29:49.168
Mr. Davidge,
you have no authorization.

01:29:49.243 --> 01:29:51.177
Please de-plane
immediately.

01:29:51.245 --> 01:29:53.770
No way, Charlie.
I'm going out.

01:29:58.619 --> 01:30:01.588
Shut down those engines, mister!
Get the hell out of there!

01:30:01.655 --> 01:30:05.751
I'm going through! I swear it!
Now you open those doors.

01:30:05.826 --> 01:30:08.761
We have an emergency.

01:30:08.829 --> 01:30:11.889
I'm going through!
Open them up!

01:30:11.966 --> 01:30:14.935
Open the doors!
Now!

01:32:06.147 --> 01:32:09.947
Zammis.
Jareeba Zammis.

01:32:10.017 --> 01:32:11.951
Jareeba Zammis!

01:32:16.624 --> 01:32:19.684
Zammis? Zammis, huh?

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.786
Zammis? Zammis?
Gavee?

01:32:26.267 --> 01:32:28.827
Talmon. Talmon!

01:32:28.903 --> 01:32:31.900
Hey! What's all this
standing around?

01:32:33.769 --> 01:32:35.828
Come on,
back to work!

01:32:35.904 --> 01:32:40.000
You miserable slime!
Where do you think you are?

01:32:41.777 --> 01:32:46.077
A goddamn retirement home?
Move! Move!

01:32:47.816 --> 01:32:51.217
What are you staring at, slimebag?
Son of a bitch!

01:33:17.346 --> 01:33:20.645
You are Uncle.

01:33:22.651 --> 01:33:25.085
Of course
we know your Zammis.

01:33:26.855 --> 01:33:29.756
He spoke only to me,

01:33:29.825 --> 01:33:33.090
for only I know
the Earthman speech.

01:33:33.161 --> 01:33:35.356
Where is Zammis now?

01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:40.094
Somewhere in their ship,
if he's still alive.

01:33:59.288 --> 01:34:01.916
What a lousy hand this is.
How about a redeal?

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.090
- Is that you, Dagget?
- Yeah.

01:34:08.163 --> 01:34:10.723
- What's going on out there?
- Trouble.

01:34:10.799 --> 01:34:12.926
- What kind of trouble?
- This kind!

01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:58.406
Zammis!
Zammis!

01:35:58.473 --> 01:36:00.771
Zammis, wake up!

01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:03.174
It's Uncle.

01:36:03.245 --> 01:36:05.679
Zammis!

01:36:07.082 --> 01:36:10.574
Oh, no, no, no.

01:36:14.022 --> 01:36:16.752
Zammis. Zammis!

01:36:16.825 --> 01:36:18.123
Zammis!

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:44.714
Aah!

01:36:49.357 --> 01:36:50.120
Hi.

01:36:52.461 --> 01:36:54.452
Hey, this guy's B.T.A.

01:36:54.529 --> 01:36:57.225
Thanks for
the hot tip.

01:36:58.767 --> 01:37:01.235
What are you doing
here, B.T.A. Man?

01:37:09.478 --> 01:37:13.209
You see that I'm
impatient, don't you?

01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:19.577
I remember you now.

01:37:19.654 --> 01:37:22.214
You killed
my brother Johnny.

01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:25.487
I thought you
croaked out there.

01:37:35.937 --> 01:37:38.132
Wake him up
and bring him along.

01:37:42.677 --> 01:37:46.306
Get up!
We don't carry you.

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.838
Shit!

01:38:30.826 --> 01:38:34.389
Hold it, sucker!
Yeah!

01:38:36.464 --> 01:38:39.092
Let's drop the little woggie
in the soup. What do you say?

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:42.193
- Boil his bones!
- Don't do it! Stop!

01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:45.000
Yeah!

01:38:45.073 --> 01:38:50.534
Hey, B.T.A. Man, where are you?
I want you to see this.

01:38:57.452 --> 01:39:01.548
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

01:39:01.623 --> 01:39:05.059
Come on!

01:39:07.796 --> 01:39:10.287
Don't! No, don't!
Zammis!

01:39:31.286 --> 01:39:33.316
Zammis!

01:39:33.316 --> 01:39:34.681
Zammis!

01:39:35.518 --> 01:39:37.452
Zammis!

01:39:39.823 --> 01:39:42.223
Yah!

01:40:13.456 --> 01:40:15.822
Wait, wait, wait!

01:40:18.028 --> 01:40:20.462
Bubble, bubble,
toil and trouble!

01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:22.794
For my little brother.

01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:28.337
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:40:28.405 --> 01:40:30.737
It's time
to say good-bye.

01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:16.578
Zammis. Zammis.

01:41:16.653 --> 01:41:20.020
It's me. Wake up.

01:41:23.059 --> 01:41:26.324
Zammis, wake up.

01:41:27.497 --> 01:41:29.965
Wake up.
It's Uncle.

01:41:32.802 --> 01:41:36.135
It's Uncle, huh?

01:41:36.206 --> 01:41:38.140
Zammis...

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:41.405
get four five.

01:41:44.447 --> 01:41:49.180
Uncle, you look terrible.

01:41:49.252 --> 01:41:51.186
I do?

01:41:53.556 --> 01:41:55.490
I really do.

01:41:58.328 --> 01:42:00.353
So do you,
you little tadpole.

01:42:02.732 --> 01:42:05.997
I told you
I'd never forget you.

01:42:31.094 --> 01:42:36.259
And so Davidge brought
Zammis and the Dracs home.

01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:45.234
He fulfilled his vow...

01:42:45.308 --> 01:42:48.368
and recited the line
of Zammis' fore fathers...

01:42:48.445 --> 01:42:51.744
before the holy council
on Dracon.

01:43:18.808 --> 01:43:22.073
And when,
in the fullness of time,

01:43:22.145 --> 01:43:26.104
Zammis brought its own child
before the holy council,

01:43:26.182 --> 01:43:28.412
the name of Willis Davidge...

01:43:28.485 --> 01:43:31.579
was added
to the line of Jareeba.
