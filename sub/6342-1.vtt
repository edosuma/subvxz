02:06.473 --> 02:09.908
Halloween just got awesome, bitches!

02:09.976 --> 02:12.968
<i>Prepare for the entrance of Lord Vader.</i>

02:13.046 --> 02:16.573
Give yourself to the Dark Side.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.483
<i>It's the only way you can save-</i>

02:19.553 --> 02:21.544
<i>You wore the same th/ng last year.</i>

02:21.621 --> 02:24.954
<i>- You son of a b/tch.
- I'm sorry, guys. My codpiece is killing me.</i>

02:25.025 --> 02:26.515
<i>It's totally restr/ct/ng my junk.</i>

02:26.593 --> 02:29.824
<i>You're gonna sp/ll /t or fill /t, dude?</i>

02:29.896 --> 02:31.625
Zoe.

02:31.698 --> 02:34.166
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. It's been a long time.

02:34.234 --> 02:36.702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:36.770 --> 02:40.706
You are...
something with tampons.

02:40.774 --> 02:42.799
I'm Picasso's Blue Period.

02:42.876 --> 02:46.073
- Get it? Blue Period.
- Hmm.

02:46.146 --> 02:48.273
And you are?
Corporate sleaze?

02:48.348 --> 02:50.339
Car salesman.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.612
I came straight from work, so this is-

02:52.686 --> 02:55.814
- Weak as usual, Bottler.
- Thank you.

02:55.889 --> 02:58.551
Are you here
for a reunion with the boys?

02:58.625 --> 03:00.923
<i>Nope. That's just a pleasant surpr/se.</i>

03:00.994 --> 03:02.393
Watch the cape, uh, uh-

03:02.462 --> 03:05.295
Well, enter at your own risk.

03:05.365 --> 03:07.458
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:07.534 --> 03:09.832
You guys have both got to stop
perpetuating this myth...

03:09.903 --> 03:12.633
that Boba Fett is some kind of bad-ass.

03:12.706 --> 03:16.301
All right? He has a jet pack.
So did the Rocketeer.

03:16.376 --> 03:18.367
- Really cool.
- Here we go.

03:18.445 --> 03:21.846
When it comes time for battle, the man's
Michael Bay- all style, no substance.

03:21.915 --> 03:24.008
If you diss the Fett again...

03:24.084 --> 03:26.052
<i>I w/ll corn-hole you w/th a I/ghtsaberl</i>

03:26.119 --> 03:27.347
<i>Whoop, there /t /s</i>

03:27.420 --> 03:30.184
<i>- Jesus. Is that Bottler?
- Whoop, there /t /s</i>

03:30.257 --> 03:31.724
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Whoop, there /t /s</i>

03:31.791 --> 03:36.592
<i>Whoop, there /t /s</i>

03:36.663 --> 03:39.427
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

03:42.769 --> 03:44.760
Give Daddy a huggy.

03:44.838 --> 03:47.272
- Yeah!
- Stop.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.331
You little bastard, I missed you.

03:49.409 --> 03:52.207
I hope that's just your blaster poking me.

03:52.279 --> 03:56.045
- God, it's been parsecs.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too, man.

03:56.116 --> 03:59.381
- Linus.
- Hmm.

03:59.452 --> 04:03.183
- It's been, like, a year now, right?
- Three.

04:03.256 --> 04:07.090
- You still drawing?
- No. I bailed on that shit after high school.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.721
- How's life in the auto trade?
- Still second in command to the old man.

04:10.797 --> 04:12.389
<i>Um, you?</i>

04:12.465 --> 04:14.490
Comic book store's still afloat...

04:14.568 --> 04:16.728
but the geeks aren't biting
like the old days.

04:16.803 --> 04:21.502
- You?
- Get my money together so I can start my detailing business.

04:21.575 --> 04:23.566
I'm gonna call it the Hutch Touch.

04:23.643 --> 04:28.080
That's funny. I could've sworn you were
delivering pizza and living in your mom's garage.

04:28.148 --> 04:29.706
It's not a garage.

04:29.783 --> 04:32.081
It's a carriage house.

04:32.152 --> 04:34.211
Carriage house.

04:34.287 --> 04:37.882
<i>How is your carriage?</i>

04:42.729 --> 04:45.163
Ah! Ah! Ah!

04:45.231 --> 04:48.667
Hey, uh, have any of you guys
seen the phone jack?

04:48.735 --> 04:52.330
Uh, no, but I have seen
the social retard...

04:52.405 --> 04:54.566
who brought his Toughbook to a party.

04:54.641 --> 04:58.509
- I promised Rogue Leader I'd write her back tonight.
- Oh, God.

04:58.578 --> 05:01.513
<i>- She /s my girlfriend.
- On-line girlfriend.</i>

05:01.581 --> 05:05.108
<i>I met her /n a Jed/ chat room.
The woman /s perfect.</i>

05:05.185 --> 05:10.282
She's intelligent and acerbic and, uh-
and a die-hard fan.

05:10.357 --> 05:12.484
She's even got connections
inside the Lucas camp.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.823
<i>Who's also got
a man package and a goatee.</i>

05:14.894 --> 05:17.522
<i>You guys are all just jealous
because she descr/bes herself...</i>

05:17.597 --> 05:19.588
as a cross between
Sarah Michelle Gellar...

05:19.666 --> 05:21.634
<i>and Janeane Garofalo.</i>

05:21.701 --> 05:23.430
Tell 'em how you described yourself.

05:23.503 --> 05:25.767
I was perfectly honest with her.

05:25.839 --> 05:28.307
- You said you looked like
a white Billy Dee Williams.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.843
<i>You called yourself wh/te chocolate.</i>

05:30.910 --> 05:33.708
<i>I am white chocolate.</i>

05:33.780 --> 05:36.078
<i>Oh, oh! Windows, it's my turn.</i>

05:36.149 --> 05:38.379
<i>- G/ve /t to me.
- Midnight. Another day down.</i>

05:38.451 --> 05:40.510
Ah! Okay.

05:40.587 --> 05:42.680
<i>Official Ep/sode I countdown...</i>

05:42.756 --> 05:47.022
is six months, 12 days,
eight hours and some change.

05:47.093 --> 05:50.790
I would sell my soul to see
that movie right here right now.

05:50.864 --> 05:53.298
<i>Dude, I would sell my left nut.
And I only have the one nut.</i>

05:53.366 --> 05:58.633
- So you see how serious I am?
- I cannot listen to this shit for another six months.

05:58.705 --> 06:02.232
Oh, shush your mouth, woman.
You know, we could see the movie.

06:05.478 --> 06:09.642
- Oh, please, not this again.
- Oh, yes, please, this again.

06:09.716 --> 06:12.241
"Tell us about
the rabbits, George. George. "

06:12.318 --> 06:14.218
Lmagine.

06:14.287 --> 06:15.549
<i>Okay?</i>

06:15.622 --> 06:19.683
We drive across the country in one night.

06:19.759 --> 06:24.594
<i>We break /nto the Skywalker Ranch.</i>

06:24.664 --> 06:26.928
And steal ourselves a print.

06:28.068 --> 06:31.560
<i>Yeahl</i>

06:31.638 --> 06:34.698
You guys have been talking about this
since the fifth grade, okay?

06:34.774 --> 06:37.368
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why the hell not?

06:37.444 --> 06:39.435
Well, first of all, it's 2,000 miles away.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.777
Second of all, even if you could get there,
you'd be arrested.

06:42.849 --> 06:44.908
It's been a blast, Bottler.

06:46.219 --> 06:48.744
Way to douche up the party.

06:48.822 --> 06:51.052
Nothing is impossible.

06:54.527 --> 06:59.624
<i>And I'll guarantee I'll find you a new
or used car, or my name /sn't B/g Chuck.</i>

06:59.699 --> 07:02.759
- Right, girls?
- Ooh-hoo!

07:02.836 --> 07:04.394
<i>Hool</i>

07:04.471 --> 07:07.065
<i>Yeahl</i>

07:07.140 --> 07:08.607
All right!

07:08.675 --> 07:12.008
Attaboy, Eric.
Now, see, that's some slick advertising.

07:12.078 --> 07:13.443
Thanks, Pop.

07:13.513 --> 07:15.879
Reminds me of, what, that
Terry Bruckheimer movies.

07:15.949 --> 07:17.644
<i>Yeah. Top Gun.</i>

07:22.255 --> 07:24.450
<i>- Thanks.
- H/ya, Er/c.</i>

07:26.326 --> 07:29.090
I'll handle this, Myron.
Thanks.

07:29.162 --> 07:31.960
- Hey.
- We're in the market for some used droids.

07:32.031 --> 07:34.056
I should start you guys off
with a new set of wheels first...

07:34.134 --> 07:36.694
unless you're cool riding
around in the same rusted old shit box...

07:36.770 --> 07:38.761
you've had since the 10th grade.

07:38.838 --> 07:40.863
Hey, hey, hey!

07:40.940 --> 07:44.137
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.644
Uh, why are you guys here?

07:46.713 --> 07:49.079
Do you wanna look around the lot a little bit,
drive something? What?

07:49.149 --> 07:51.743
<i>No. Uh, we came to talk about L/nus.</i>

07:51.818 --> 07:54.309
Well, he just needs to realize
that people lose touch.

07:54.387 --> 07:56.855
<i>- That's just k/nd of the way th/ngs work.
- He's dying, Eric.</i>

07:57.857 --> 08:00.951
- What?
- He's got cancer, man.

08:01.027 --> 08:05.760
<i>He's tr/ed everyth/ng to get better,
but noth/ng seems to work.</i>

08:05.832 --> 08:08.824
<i>Odds say three, four months maybe.</i>

08:08.902 --> 08:11.097
And you guys are telling me this now?

08:11.171 --> 08:13.264
We wanted to tell you
months ago, honestly...

08:13.339 --> 08:16.137
but Linus made us promise
not to say anything.

08:16.209 --> 08:20.009
<i>The way we see /t, you guys have been
best fr/ends s/nce, I/ke, first grade.</i>

08:20.079 --> 08:23.674
<i>So we figured you got the r/ght to know.
You got the r/ght to make your peace.</i>

08:23.750 --> 08:27.880
How am I supposed to make my peace
when the guy doesn't even want me to know?

08:27.954 --> 08:30.684
With all due respect, Eric,
this isn't about you.

08:32.592 --> 08:35.152
- L-You know what?
- Holy shit.

08:35.227 --> 08:40.164
- Jesus Christ.
- If it ain't C-3Penis Face and R2-Dickhead.

08:40.232 --> 08:42.224
What did you just say, you giant bastard?

08:42.302 --> 08:44.361
<i>- Well, well put.
- Thank you.</i>

08:44.437 --> 08:47.338
- Still see you're driving the nerd-mobile.
- Chaz, you're an idiot.

08:47.407 --> 08:50.535
Hey, you know what? While you're out here
sticking G.I. Joes up your butt...

08:50.610 --> 08:53.170
I convinced Dad to let me
recut the commercial.

08:53.246 --> 08:55.305
So suck it. Huh?

08:55.381 --> 08:58.908
<i>Aw, see, you fl/nched.
That's gonna be two, Pr/ncess Le/a.</i>

08:58.985 --> 09:00.976
Nanu-nanu.

09:01.054 --> 09:03.716
Get a haircut.

09:03.790 --> 09:07.157
- We should have killed him when we had the chance.
- Yeah.

09:07.227 --> 09:10.754
Jackass. Linus is coming over
to the carriage house later. So are you.

09:10.830 --> 09:13.162
Bye, Eric.

09:20.106 --> 09:22.165
<i>No I/ghtn/ngl No I/ghtn/ngl</i>

09:22.342 --> 09:25.800
- Aw, shit. I'm a midget.
- I'm gonna flatten your ass right now.

09:25.845 --> 09:29.337
Ah!
Suck it, Count Fagula.

09:29.415 --> 09:31.212
Wow!

09:31.284 --> 09:33.684
<i>- There's no team/ng up.
That's a rule!</i>

09:33.753 --> 09:36.017
<i>Owl Head crampl</i>

09:36.089 --> 09:38.080
Don't kill me.

09:39.359 --> 09:40.849
<i>- Hey.
- Donkey balls.</i>

09:40.927 --> 09:42.758
You made it, man.

09:44.831 --> 09:50.326
<i>Your mom sa/d clean up th/s sh/t- hole
or no gr/lled cheese for a week?</i>

09:50.403 --> 09:52.462
That's emotional blackmail,
and you know it!

09:52.538 --> 09:55.803
<i>- Screw youl
- I will sue you! Renter's rights!</i>

09:55.875 --> 09:59.038
<i>- You don't pay rentl
- Damn. Damn!</i>

09:59.112 --> 10:01.945
- What the hell is he doing here, man?
- It was Hutch's idea.

10:02.015 --> 10:04.040
Grab a controller.

10:04.117 --> 10:06.108
We're ganging up on Windows in Mario Kart.

10:06.185 --> 10:09.211
I can't.
I came to talk to Linus actually.

10:10.423 --> 10:12.983
<i>Can I talk to you alone, man?</i>

10:14.994 --> 10:18.953
Linus. Hey, stop walking.
Linus! Hold up, man.

10:19.032 --> 10:23.901
- Stop. What the hell, man? I did nothing to you.
- Exactly. You did nothing.

10:23.970 --> 10:25.904
<i>Absolutely noth/ng.</i>

10:25.972 --> 10:28.065
Eric Bottler graduates high school
and never looks back.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.405
You bailed on our plan, Bottler!

10:30.476 --> 10:32.501
What plan?
To be the next big thing in comics?

10:32.578 --> 10:34.569
Come on, man.
That was never gonna happen.

10:34.647 --> 10:38.674
I did what I had to do, dude. I grew up.
I'm the only one who did.

10:38.751 --> 10:41.185
<i>- Look at you guys.
- You can fool everybody...</i>

10:41.254 --> 10:43.814
with this cheap suit,
salesman-of-the-year pitch.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.915
But I know you better than anybody...

10:45.992 --> 10:50.395
and deep down,
you are one miserable son of a bitch.

10:50.463 --> 10:53.261
- Miserable, huh?
- Yeah. Miserable.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.666
Miserable is wasting your life
in Hutch's garage playing video games...

10:56.736 --> 10:58.670
arguing whether or not
Luke really had a thing for Leia.

10:58.738 --> 11:02.401
You know as well as anybody...

11:02.475 --> 11:06.536
that as soon as Luke knew Leia
was his sister, it was hands off.

11:06.612 --> 11:07.874
They still kiss.

11:07.947 --> 11:11.007
That was Leia kissing Luke
to make Han jealous.

11:11.084 --> 11:12.847
That was the second time.
The first time-

11:12.919 --> 11:14.910
The first time they're about to die!

11:14.988 --> 11:18.048
- They were not, you liar.
- They were swinging 30,000 feet in the air.

11:18.124 --> 11:21.218
You know when you're a sibling, okay?
There's something innate.

11:21.294 --> 11:24.525
<i>- There's no telepathy between Luke and Leia till Ep/sode VI.
- It spans the ocean.</i>

11:24.597 --> 11:26.724
It was romance in a sci-fi opera!

11:26.799 --> 11:28.960
Who cares about this shit, man? Huh?

11:29.035 --> 11:32.869
- Who cares about-
- I do. I care.

11:44.851 --> 11:47.911
You need a new car.

11:47.987 --> 11:51.582
They were siblings.
They were siblings, you sick bastard!

11:54.794 --> 11:58.025
<i>You are trapped now.</i>

11:58.097 --> 12:01.032
You've made your last mistake.

12:12.111 --> 12:13.601
We need to talk.

12:13.679 --> 12:15.738
Sure, Pop.
What's up?

12:16.949 --> 12:19.076
Okay. Here's the deal.

12:19.152 --> 12:23.054
<i>It's t/me for the world
to see the new face of th/s company.</i>

12:23.122 --> 12:25.716
And his name's Big Eric.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.589
Big Eric who?

12:27.660 --> 12:30.561
Big Eric you.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.724
It's all yours, kiddo.
The entire shebang.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.132
<i>All 15 locat/ons, from here to Seattle.</i>

12:36.202 --> 12:39.899
I mean- Uh, yes.

12:39.972 --> 12:42.964
<i>Yeah. I mean, wow.</i>

12:43.042 --> 12:46.102
- Take the hat.
- I can't take your hat.

12:46.179 --> 12:47.737
Go ahead.

12:47.814 --> 12:49.577
No, really.
It looks good on you.

12:49.649 --> 12:50.911
- Take the hat.
- But it's really-

12:50.983 --> 12:55.420
- Take the damn hat.
- Yeah. I'll wear it for-

12:55.488 --> 12:58.946
My God. Your mom would be so proud
to see you in that hat.

12:59.025 --> 13:01.050
I know, Pop.

13:01.127 --> 13:04.824
Hey. You and me?
Tanning Tuesdays?

13:11.871 --> 13:15.102
You want to take your shirt off.

13:20.213 --> 13:23.410
You want to take your shirt off. God.

13:23.483 --> 13:26.316
- You wanna take that shirt off?
- Asshole.

13:26.385 --> 13:29.320
You have been trying thatJedi mind shit
on me since the eighth grade.

13:29.388 --> 13:32.824
- It doesn't work.
- Oh, it works. Tell her, Windows.

13:32.892 --> 13:35.520
- He's been geeking out
with Rogue Leader all morning.

13:35.595 --> 13:37.995
<i>Noth/ng can tear h/m away.</i>

13:38.064 --> 13:41.363
<i>- Ah!
- Rogue Leader, you are w/cked.</i>

13:41.434 --> 13:45.495
Ah, I love the feeling of fresh air
on my naked breasts.

13:45.571 --> 13:48.096
Oh, ho-ho!

13:48.174 --> 13:51.473
See that?
Man's immune to sweater yams.

13:51.544 --> 13:54.809
What about me?
I like sweater yams!

13:57.483 --> 13:58.973
Hey.

14:08.161 --> 14:10.152
What'll it be, fellas?

14:10.229 --> 14:12.993
<i>- How much for the phaser gun?
- For the phaser gun?</i>

14:13.065 --> 14:17.126
<i>Sorry, Garfunkel.
We don't hock Trek here.</i>

14:17.203 --> 14:19.831
<i>Well, then, Slim,
if you don't sell the Trek.</i>

14:19.906 --> 14:22.704
Then why do you have
a phaser gun in the case?

14:22.775 --> 14:26.074
We keep this one here to suss out
Trekkie bitches like yourself...

14:26.145 --> 14:28.170
and tell them to get
the hell off of our land.

14:28.247 --> 14:30.579
So get the hell off of our land.

14:30.650 --> 14:34.882
Get the hell off of our land!
Get the hell out of here! Now!

14:34.954 --> 14:38.515
<i>Get out ofhere,
you K/rk-lov/n'Spock-suckersl</i>

14:44.597 --> 14:47.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.894
You guys know where a guy can pawn off
a first edition Eric Bottler comic?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.665
- Hey!
- Holy cannolis.

14:52.738 --> 14:54.763
Look at that.
Yeah. That's awesome.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.276
Dude, you had sick skills back then.
You should've stuck with it, brother.

14:58.344 --> 15:01.040
Yeah. I would've been broke and living
in my parents' garage.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.775
- It's a carriage house.
- Right. I know it is.

15:03.849 --> 15:07.012
I have something else
that you guys might wanna check out.

15:09.455 --> 15:13.516
Well, what have we got here?

15:13.593 --> 15:17.689
<i>Oh/o to Cal/for-
Is th/s what I th/nk /t /s?</i>

15:17.763 --> 15:20.231
<i>L/nus la/d the whole th/ng out /n fifth grade.</i>

15:20.299 --> 15:23.200
<i>I figure /t's t/me
for another ep/c journey, /sn't /t?</i>

15:23.269 --> 15:25.134
What's your game plan?

15:25.204 --> 15:27.934
We storm the ranch, or we die trying.

15:28.007 --> 15:29.599
Yeah.

15:31.544 --> 15:33.910
Well, you guys were
all about this at the party.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.471
- We were six Zimas to the wind at the party.
- Drunk.

15:36.549 --> 15:40.576
Come on. You even said the Rogue Leader
has connections inside the ranch, right?

15:40.653 --> 15:43.554
<i>Rogue Leader? Please, man.
W/ndows never even met h/m.</i>

15:43.623 --> 15:45.591
- Her!
- Him.

15:45.658 --> 15:48.821
- Maybe it's time that he does.
- Dude, this is a suicide mission, man.

15:48.894 --> 15:50.885
Why would we even try anything like this?

15:50.963 --> 15:53.090
For Linus.

15:58.904 --> 16:01.566
Huh?

16:02.708 --> 16:04.733
No.

16:04.810 --> 16:07.335
- No?
- No. I'm not going.

16:07.413 --> 16:09.677
Aw, Linus, you've got to go.

16:09.749 --> 16:12.309
This is a conquest for the ages.

16:12.385 --> 16:14.319
<i>Our names shall become legend.</i>

16:14.387 --> 16:17.845
Spoken in hushed tones
by nerds across the galaxy.

16:17.923 --> 16:20.016
And we'll get laid.

16:22.228 --> 16:24.628
<i>More than
we've ever been la/d</i>

16:30.236 --> 16:33.637
- Okay, please stop that.
- Sorry. I was getting into that.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.002
I just don't wanna go
with Opie over there.

16:38.077 --> 16:41.376
Check this out, man.

16:52.325 --> 16:54.350
Floor plans to the Lucas Ranch.

16:54.427 --> 16:58.022
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Are you kidding? How did you get these?

16:58.097 --> 17:01.225
My life partner, Rogue Leader,
she can break us in, man.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.996
The question you got to ask yourself is...

17:04.069 --> 17:06.560
"Do you have the nut sack
to go through with it?"

17:13.779 --> 17:16.009
If I do this, it doesn't change anything.

17:23.089 --> 17:25.182
I'll grab my suitcase
and some Big League Chew.

17:25.257 --> 17:28.192
- Yes!
- ThunderCats! Ho!

17:28.260 --> 17:30.421
- Told you. I knew he'd go.
- Stop humping.

17:30.496 --> 17:32.987
Please stop humping.
Just high five.

17:33.065 --> 17:36.057
- Oh, God. I'm Jabba the Hump.
- Oh, goddamn it.

17:36.135 --> 17:38.968
- Chewie!
- Chewie! Damn it!

17:41.173 --> 17:45.109
<i>Wa/t a second. Whoa.
What the hell's Chew/e?</i>

17:45.177 --> 17:48.772
It's the same rules as shotgun.
Either way, I always lose.

17:48.848 --> 17:51.817
- Furball, you do the honors?
- Yeah.

17:54.453 --> 17:56.785
Strap in, fellas.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.353
<i>Whool</i>

18:08.601 --> 18:11.399
What the hell, Hutch?
It's all Rush.

18:11.470 --> 18:14.462
<i>- Ever want a little variety?
- Rush /s var/ety, b/tch.</i>

18:14.540 --> 18:17.065
<i>Ohl</i>

18:17.143 --> 18:21.512
Rule number one:
In my van, it's Rush.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.980
All Rush, all the time.

18:24.049 --> 18:25.448
<i>No except/ons.</i>

18:25.518 --> 18:28.078
Rule number two:

18:28.154 --> 18:30.281
Nobody touch the red button.

18:30.356 --> 18:34.588
<i>And I mean never touch the red button.</i>

18:34.660 --> 18:38.892
<i>Most /mportantly,
rule number three:</i>

18:38.964 --> 18:41.228
There's no jerking it in my van.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.291
What?

18:43.369 --> 18:46.429
Fine.

18:48.107 --> 18:51.770
<i>Don't roll your eyes at me, Adm/ral Jackbar.</i>

18:53.746 --> 18:55.839
"Established in 1985...

18:55.915 --> 18:58.008
"the Skywalker Ranch
is the headquarters...

18:58.083 --> 19:00.517
of George Lucas's filmmaking empire. "

19:00.586 --> 19:02.577
So according to Rogue Leader's map...

19:02.655 --> 19:06.853
our best odds for finding
the film is in here- the main house.

19:06.926 --> 19:10.589
Oh, my God.
That place is legendary.

19:10.663 --> 19:14.326
And we meet Rogue Leader at a coffee shop
in Texas Wednesday, 3:00 p. m. Sharp.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.732
- Mm-hmm. - She's gonna give us
absolutely everything we need...

19:16.802 --> 19:18.827
- to get into the compound.
- Nice.

19:18.904 --> 19:21.099
White chocolate finally gets
to meet his dream girl.

19:21.173 --> 19:24.006
<i>- Ohl
- Oohl Oohl</i>

19:24.076 --> 19:27.477
<i>Well, accord/ng to th/s,
80 West /s our fastest route.</i>

19:27.546 --> 19:31.346
So we got 26 hours
to make it to Texas, boys.

19:31.417 --> 19:33.647
Consider it done.

19:38.290 --> 19:39.882
Ah!

19:48.267 --> 19:53.170
<i>Wakey, wakey. Hands off steakey.</i>

19:53.239 --> 19:57.300
- It's time for Hutch's pit stop.
- Where are we?

19:57.376 --> 20:00.812
Some say heaven.
I like to call it Iowa.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.314
Iowa?
What about Rogue Leader?

20:03.382 --> 20:07.011
- Iowa?
- Yeah. I made a little detour.

20:07.086 --> 20:09.020
Hutch, we're supposed
to be going to Texas.

20:09.088 --> 20:11.056
Welcome to Riverside, gentlemen...

20:11.123 --> 20:16.390
<i>future b/rthplace of one
Capta/n James T. K/rk.</i>

20:16.462 --> 20:19.488
Enemy territory! Nice.

20:19.565 --> 20:22.932
Man, you drove all night for this?

20:23.002 --> 20:25.698
Dude, I'd drive all year for the chance
to pimp slap some Trekkies.

20:25.771 --> 20:28.069
<i>You know what?
Leave me out of /t.</i>

20:32.311 --> 20:34.336
Let's crack some Trekkie skulls!

20:34.413 --> 20:36.347
<i>Let's do /tl</i>

20:39.618 --> 20:43.179
And it is believed
that on this very spot...

20:43.255 --> 20:46.418
Captain James Tiberius Kirk will be born.

20:46.492 --> 20:50.087
<i>Hence, the statue /mmortal/z/ng h/m.</i>

20:50.162 --> 20:54.189
Grappling with his most accursed nemesis.

20:54.266 --> 20:56.564
Ricardo Montalbán?

20:56.635 --> 20:59.695
Genetically engineered tyrant Khan.

20:59.772 --> 21:02.536
<i>- It doesn't look like either of them.
- Thank you for po/nt/ng that out.</i>

21:02.608 --> 21:06.009
That is because the whores at Viacom
International threatened to sue us...

21:06.078 --> 21:08.603
if we used their likenesses,
so we make do.

21:08.681 --> 21:11.445
<i>Yes. The gentleman /n the be/ge.</i>

21:11.517 --> 21:15.317
I was wondering what did Sulu find
in Captain Kirk's lavatory.

21:15.387 --> 21:20.290
Sulu clearly found a standard issue
Starfleet Z23 personal refuse device.

21:20.359 --> 21:22.884
I believe it was the Captain's log.

21:22.962 --> 21:24.827
<i>Very good.</i>

21:24.897 --> 21:29.163
A laugh a day keeps the doctor away, everyone.
We've been saved.

21:29.234 --> 21:31.600
- Ooh.
- Any other comic relief?

21:31.670 --> 21:33.831
- Ah!
- There's still homeless out there.

21:33.906 --> 21:36.397
- Hey!
- Yes! What? You! What? Yes.

21:36.475 --> 21:41.310
<i>What /s the Kl/ngon translat/on
for, "You're gonna d/e a v/rg/n"?</i>

21:48.120 --> 21:52.022
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Hilarious, everyone.

21:52.091 --> 21:55.288
Looks like we got more Lucas hounds
here to mock Roddenberry.

21:55.361 --> 21:57.454
Congratulations, gentlemen,
but I would like to see...

21:57.529 --> 22:00.862
your Darth Vader take on one Borg drone.

22:00.933 --> 22:03.299
And we'll see who's laughing then.
Am I right?

22:03.369 --> 22:08.306
Darth Vader can put the entire
Borg collective in a vice grip with his mind.

22:08.374 --> 22:10.604
Uh, Darth Vader has asthma...

22:10.676 --> 22:14.442
<i>so name me one Star Trek character
with a respiratory disease...</i>

22:14.513 --> 22:16.606
'cause I'm drawing a blank.

22:16.682 --> 22:18.445
<i>Name me one
Star Wars character who's gay.</i>

22:18.517 --> 22:20.041
- Yeah.
- Besides you.

22:20.119 --> 22:23.384
<i>Well, no one's gay in Star Trek,
so why would I even do that?</i>

22:23.455 --> 22:24.786
Captain Picard.

22:24.857 --> 22:27.826
Captain Picard is not gay.
He's British.

22:27.893 --> 22:31.192
- Come on. "Make it so!"
- ¶ Ah-ah ¶¶

22:31.263 --> 22:35.063
I hate to break it to you losers,
but Han Solo's a bitch.

22:35.134 --> 22:37.193
<i>Ah, no, he d/dn't. No, he d/dn't.</i>

22:37.269 --> 22:39.760
What did you just say?

22:41.306 --> 22:44.764
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, there sure is, Spock.

22:44.843 --> 22:47.505
The admiral here just
called Han Solo a bitch.

22:47.579 --> 22:50.571
- Good one.
- Some pretty strong words for a Trekkie.

22:50.649 --> 22:53.311
A Trekkie is derogatory
at this point in the game.

22:53.385 --> 22:55.512
Trekker is what we're called now.
Trekker.

22:55.587 --> 22:57.418
Oh, I'm sorry.
Trekkie.

23:00.726 --> 23:03.251
Just take a look-see here.

23:03.328 --> 23:05.023
What's with the man-purse?

23:05.097 --> 23:07.531
Yep. As I thought...

23:07.599 --> 23:11.558
scanner reads "douche bag. "

23:20.312 --> 23:24.408
Push me, I'll kill your whole Starfleet.

23:24.483 --> 23:26.178
Unbelievable!

23:27.486 --> 23:29.351
Snikt! Snitk!
Come on, bub!

23:29.421 --> 23:31.412
Attack, you cowards!
That's an order!

23:33.425 --> 23:34.915
<i>- Hutch!
- Cover me, W/ndowsl</i>

23:38.497 --> 23:40.465
Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

23:58.150 --> 24:01.779
- My ear!
- Ha-ha!

24:01.854 --> 24:04.254
Nighty-night, Spock-sucker.

24:07.226 --> 24:09.421
Beam this, bitch!

24:09.495 --> 24:12.828
Time-out!
I call time-out! Time-out!

24:20.472 --> 24:23.168
- Disable their vehicle.
- Get in! Go!

24:23.242 --> 24:25.608
<i>Get /n the vanl
Get /n the vanl</i>

24:25.677 --> 24:26.974
Disable the vehicle.

24:29.581 --> 24:31.742
Kill the Star-roids!

24:31.817 --> 24:34.684
<i>Get theml</i>

24:34.753 --> 24:37.916
Han Solo is still a bitch!

24:37.990 --> 24:41.790
Nobody calls Han Solo a bitch.

24:47.366 --> 24:48.628
Yeah!

24:54.006 --> 24:57.942
Hey, Bottler, hit 'em
with the pressed ham!

24:59.077 --> 25:01.637
Klingon to this.

25:05.951 --> 25:10.820
Kha-a-a-an!

25:14.259 --> 25:19.287
Kha-a-a-an!

25:24.570 --> 25:27.334
Whoo!

25:27.406 --> 25:30.204
I took that Vulcan down hard.

25:30.275 --> 25:33.540
I rolled him into the dirt
like he was my frickin tauntaun.

25:33.612 --> 25:38.413
<i>Tauntaun, my ass. If /t wasn't for me,
you guys would all be dead.</i>

25:38.483 --> 25:41.418
<i>What fight were you watch/ng?
I was channel/ng the emperor.</i>

25:41.486 --> 25:45.650
<i>The emperor? I don't remember the emperor
crapp/ng h/s robe and scream/ng "t/me-out. "</i>

25:45.724 --> 25:48.693
- Oh, my God. That's right.
- There is such a thing as time-out.

25:48.760 --> 25:52.355
I can feel
your anger growing inside. Wait. Time-out.

26:00.806 --> 26:04.401
All right. Time-out.

26:04.843 --> 26:06.504
<i>We had to take your van, Hutch.</i>

26:06.578 --> 26:10.275
I have access to literally
thousands of vehicles...

26:10.349 --> 26:12.442
but we had to take your van.

26:12.517 --> 26:15.077
Yeah, well, I had a spare tire...

26:15.153 --> 26:18.589
but some tardo took it out
to make some room for his grappling hook.

26:18.657 --> 26:21.057
What? We're on a covert operation.

26:21.126 --> 26:23.617
How can you be on a covert operation
without a grappling hook?

26:23.695 --> 26:25.890
Oh! Wait.

26:25.964 --> 26:28.694
<i>What /n Greedo's name /s that?</i>

26:31.870 --> 26:34.703
<i>Talk about a wretched h/ve
of scum and v/lla/ny.</i>

26:34.773 --> 26:37.003
Hmm.

26:37.075 --> 26:39.805
You guys stay right here.
I'll take care of this.

26:39.878 --> 26:42.745
How you doing, fellas?
Hi, fellas.

26:42.814 --> 26:44.941
So our car broke down
a couple of miles back.

26:45.017 --> 26:47.781
Is there anyone you know who can help us?

26:47.853 --> 26:50.151
No.

26:50.222 --> 26:53.589
Can I have some water?

26:53.659 --> 26:55.058
Yeah, a glass of water, please.

26:55.127 --> 26:57.152
Great.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.628
Pirate teeth.
Pirate teeth.

27:04.703 --> 27:06.796
<i>- P/rate teeth. Don't.
- Thank you.</i>

27:06.872 --> 27:08.567
A hundred bucks.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.337
For a glass of water?
That's ridiculous. I'm not gonna pay that.

27:12.411 --> 27:14.140
Sure you will.

27:14.212 --> 27:17.113
Hell, no. Hell, no.
Back up, buddy. Back off.

27:18.917 --> 27:21.977
<i>Word to the wise, ese.</i>

27:22.054 --> 27:26.718
<i>- Oohl - Drop the tough-ass
biker routine before I get angry.</i>

27:26.792 --> 27:28.953
And you won't like me when I'm angry.

27:29.027 --> 27:31.120
Hmm, I think I would.

27:31.196 --> 27:33.221
- Hutch, let's not do this.
- Hutch, maybe-

27:33.298 --> 27:34.856
Nah. Nah. Nah.

27:34.933 --> 27:38.801
This guy wants
to dick with me, fine. I can dick.

27:38.870 --> 27:44.604
I used to rape guys 15 times
your size in prison.

27:44.676 --> 27:47.201
So you best back off...

27:47.279 --> 27:50.305
- or, so help me God, I'm gonna
pound your ass so hard- - Oh, Jesus.

27:50.382 --> 27:52.213
- No. Hutch.
- What?

27:52.284 --> 27:54.514
<i>- There's k/nd of a th/ng /n th/s bar. L/ke that.
- See?</i>

27:54.586 --> 27:58.022
<i>Lxnay on the ass pound/ng.</i>

28:01.560 --> 28:03.824
A hundred dollars?
That's cool.

28:03.895 --> 28:07.956
<i>Afraid it's too late for that, ese.</i>

28:08.033 --> 28:11.332
Our midnight entertainment bailed.

28:11.403 --> 28:13.394
Time to pay for that drink.

28:15.574 --> 28:19.533
Oh, dear God.
We're gonna die up here, aren't we?

28:21.213 --> 28:23.238
We have to strip to Menudo?

28:24.483 --> 28:27.577
You got a problem with Menudo?
Now, take it off!

28:32.657 --> 28:34.625
That's it, man!

28:34.693 --> 28:36.854
"Nobody puts Baby in a corner!"

28:38.230 --> 28:40.755
You want some Swayze action, bitches?

28:40.832 --> 28:43.062
Yeah!
You like that, huh?

28:43.135 --> 28:47.329
Whoo!

28:54.513 --> 28:58.210
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it, and you're gonna like it!

29:00.786 --> 29:03.016
<i>He's got one ball.
Un testículo.</i>

29:03.088 --> 29:06.353
<i>Oh, that's d/sgust/ng.</i>

29:06.425 --> 29:09.952
Okay, I had a...

29:10.028 --> 29:13.520
torrid lightsaber battle
went wrong when I was a child.

29:13.598 --> 29:17.364
<i>All r/ght, all r/ght, all r/ght.
Show's over, fellas.</i>

29:20.839 --> 29:24.036
- You boys took a wrong turn?
- Our car broke down.

29:24.109 --> 29:26.873
The Chief can fix it.

29:26.945 --> 29:29.038
The Chief?

29:41.460 --> 29:45.089
This is some kick-ass guac
you whipped up, man.

29:47.332 --> 29:49.129
- I feel funny.
- Tingly.

29:49.201 --> 29:52.568
- I feel good.
- Karate is cool.

29:58.743 --> 30:01.576
Guys, I don't think we're eating...

30:01.646 --> 30:04.979
your everyday garden-variety guacamole.

30:05.050 --> 30:07.075
<i>I got rec/pe from Emer/I.</i>

30:07.152 --> 30:11.088
Avocado, onion,
chopped garlic- Bam!

30:11.156 --> 30:13.021
- Bam!
- Bam!

30:13.091 --> 30:15.252
And the Chief's secret ingredient.

30:15.327 --> 30:18.854
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:18.930 --> 30:20.625
<i>Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.</i>

30:20.699 --> 30:22.860
- What?
- What?

30:22.934 --> 30:25.926
There's an ewok right beside you.

30:27.939 --> 30:31.807
<i>Oh, wow. She's hump/ng your leg.
It's hump/ng your leg.</i>

30:33.211 --> 30:35.611
<i>She's hump/ng your leg.
I love you.</i>

30:35.680 --> 30:37.375
Wahh!

30:44.856 --> 30:49.657
<i>Death /s but a path to I/fe,
a passage to the stars.</i>

30:49.728 --> 30:51.719
To the universe.

30:51.796 --> 30:54.060
I know what you mean.

30:54.132 --> 30:57.158
<i>You mean the Force.</i>

30:57.235 --> 31:00.204
<i>The Force.</i>

31:00.272 --> 31:03.730
Guys, my dad is
gonna kill me if I don't get to work on Monday.

31:03.808 --> 31:08.404
Putz. Screw it, man.

31:16.488 --> 31:18.251
- No!
- Join me, Son.

31:19.791 --> 31:22.487
Come to the Dark Side.

31:22.561 --> 31:24.893
- The Dark Side.
- No! No!

31:32.604 --> 31:36.233
<i>Rogue Leader.</i>

31:36.308 --> 31:38.708
What the hell you doing, man?
You're poking me.

31:38.777 --> 31:41.109
Oh, God. Don't flatter yourself, okay?

31:41.179 --> 31:42.703
It's just my R2.
My lucky R2.

31:42.781 --> 31:45.978
<i>Man, you w/sh you had
the he/ght and g/rth of D2.</i>

31:48.420 --> 31:51.446
<i>- Yeahl

31:51.523 --> 31:54.617
Hah! Van!

31:54.693 --> 31:58.220
Son of a whore!
The Buce is back.

31:59.297 --> 32:01.765
The Chief fixed it while you were asleep.

32:01.833 --> 32:04.859
The Chief fixed it.
Is he around? Can we thank him?

32:06.438 --> 32:09.032
He's the Chief.
You're the Chief, aren't you?

32:09.107 --> 32:14.135
- Why didn't you say so?
- The Chief likes to refer to himself in the third person.

32:14.212 --> 32:16.976
It causes confusion,
especially with the bitches.

32:17.048 --> 32:21.712
Well, you're cool as balls,
you burned-out old hash-head.

32:21.786 --> 32:24.414
Wonder Twins power activate.

32:25.624 --> 32:28.058
It's been interesting.

32:29.628 --> 32:31.960
Thanks.

32:32.030 --> 32:34.123
You need it more than I do.

32:34.199 --> 32:36.599
Wow. Thank you. I, uh-

32:38.837 --> 32:41.305
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

32:42.407 --> 32:44.398
Who's up for Texas, boys?

32:44.909 --> 32:47.844

33:47.138 --> 33:49.402
<i>- Deckard from Blade Runner.

34:12.397 --> 34:14.695
<i>Oh, she'll be here.</i>

34:14.766 --> 34:18.600
Give her a taste of that white chocolate.

34:18.670 --> 34:20.159

34:20.237 --> 34:22.001
Oh, my God.

34:23.408 --> 34:26.434

Go get her.

35:27.205 --> 35:29.969
I have to leave this state at once.

35:30.041 --> 35:32.236
Yea! Yea!

35:32.310 --> 35:34.437
That was fantastic.

35:34.512 --> 35:36.844
We drove a thousand miles, Windows.

35:36.915 --> 35:38.439
A thousand.
For what?

35:38.516 --> 35:41.679
So you can get funky
with Strawberry Shortcakes?

35:41.753 --> 35:43.778
It's not really sex if it's cyber-sex.

35:43.855 --> 35:46.722
Relax. We're gonna sit down.
We're gonna put on our thinking caps.

35:56.734 --> 35:58.895
- Hey!
- Thanks, man.

35:58.970 --> 36:01.029
Yeah, the whole thing.
The whole thing is mine now.

36:01.105 --> 36:04.871
What's the new game plan?

36:04.943 --> 36:06.934
Let's get in the van
and get the hell out of here.

36:07.011 --> 36:10.572
- This is just a minor setback.
- It's a minor setback for you.

36:10.648 --> 36:13.549
I live in the real world, okay?
I have to go back to work.

36:13.618 --> 36:17.213
You have to go back
to... your mom's garage.

36:20.859 --> 36:24.022
- It's a carriage house.
- It's a garage, man.

36:24.095 --> 36:25.687
- Say it again.
- It's a garage.

36:25.763 --> 36:27.162
<i>- Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:57.629 --> 37:00.860
Harry Knowles is kicking Windows's ass.

37:03.535 --> 37:05.526
Now, you listen to me, perv.

37:05.603 --> 37:10.165
If you ever e-mail my niece again,
I will hunt you down like a T-1000.

37:10.241 --> 37:13.574
Okay, Mr. Knowles, he didn't know- Okay.

37:13.645 --> 37:15.943
- You will release my friends.
- Back!

37:16.014 --> 37:19.415
We wanted to break into the Skywalker Ranch.
Kimmy said she'd give us the floor plans.

37:19.484 --> 37:22.419
<i>We were gonna break in
and steal Ep/sode I, that's it.</i>

37:22.487 --> 37:25.752

37:25.823 --> 37:28.917
- Ohh!
- These aren't the droids you're looking for, man.

37:28.993 --> 37:32.121
- Heh!
- Anybody else have any stupid comments?

37:32.196 --> 37:36.189
It's very stupid, but true. We've been
planning this since we were like six.

37:36.267 --> 37:37.894
Listen.
Harry, Harry, Harry.

37:37.969 --> 37:41.302
If you help us out, we'll give you all
the exclusive spoilers and all.

37:41.372 --> 37:44.136
<i>- Okay?

37:46.644 --> 37:50.136
<i>That's an interesting offer.

37:50.214 --> 37:51.806
- Irvin Kershner.

<i>You. In Episode VI when Le/a shoots down
two scout troopers.</i>

37:55.353 --> 37:57.651
Why doesn't she take one
of the speeder bikes instead of walking?

37:57.722 --> 37:59.883
If you pay attention closely,
the speeder bikes were destroyed.

37:59.958 --> 38:01.949
And then Luke refers to it
later on in the dialogue.

38:02.026 --> 38:04.654
Impressive. I wasn't really
worried about you though.

38:06.531 --> 38:09.898
<i>What was Luke Skywalker's call sign
during the rebel assault in Ep/sode IV?</i>

38:09.968 --> 38:11.959
Red 5.

- What?
- What is the name of Chewbacca's home planet?

38:23.514 --> 38:27.348
- It's never discussed in the movies.
That's not fair.

38:27.418 --> 38:29.079
<i>I know. I know.</i>

38:29.153 --> 38:31.621
Do you give up?

38:36.894 --> 38:39.158
Come on, man.
Say it.

38:39.230 --> 38:43.599
Kashyyyk. Kashyyyk.
Chewie's home planet is Kashyyyk.

38:45.837 --> 38:48.135
Chewie's home planet is Kashyyyk.

38:48.206 --> 38:51.607
Well played, boys.
I'll help you.

38:51.676 --> 38:53.974
You're gonna meet my friend in Vegas.

38:54.045 --> 38:56.980
- He's got everything you need. Okay?
- Okay.

38:57.048 --> 39:00.108
- How will we know who he is?
- Oh, don't worry. You'll know.

39:00.184 --> 39:03.779
The password: Scruffy Nerfherder.

39:03.855 --> 39:06.483
- Scruffy Nerfherder.
- Good luck, boys.

39:06.557 --> 39:08.991
Nice detailing.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.358
We're going to Vegas, fellas.

39:14.866 --> 39:17.664
Hey, Hutch, you mind slowing down?

39:17.735 --> 39:20.295
Sorry. I don't speak jagoff.

39:20.371 --> 39:23.465
I just thought it might be nice
to get to Vegas alive.

39:23.541 --> 39:25.634
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

39:27.879 --> 39:29.540
We got Imperial bacon.

39:31.683 --> 39:35.175
Okay, probably not the best time
to tell you guys this...

39:35.253 --> 39:38.120
but, uh, there's a giant bag of peyote
in the back of the van.

39:38.189 --> 39:40.180
- What?
- Excuse me?

39:42.427 --> 39:44.418
The Chief gave it to me.

39:44.495 --> 39:46.520
Hutch, just pull over
and get the ticket, man, okay?

39:46.597 --> 39:49.930
We can't pull over
with a big-ass bag of peyote on us.

39:50.001 --> 39:52.060
<i>Pull over and stopl</i>

39:52.136 --> 39:54.832
Do what he says, Hutch.
Do what he says, Hutch.

39:54.906 --> 39:57.875
<i>- Don't do what he says.
- Do what he says, Hutch.</i>

39:57.942 --> 40:01.036
- It's gonna be okay, fellas. It's gonna be okay.
- Pull over, man.

40:01.112 --> 40:02.909
Suck my exhaust, pork rind!

40:07.585 --> 40:09.246
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus!

40:09.320 --> 40:12.721
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Talk to you? He's back.

40:12.790 --> 40:14.621
- He found us!
- God!

40:14.692 --> 40:17.718
- Move this piece of shit!
- You don't call my van a piece of shit!

40:17.795 --> 40:20.286
- Well?
- Hey, ladies, ladies!

40:20.364 --> 40:22.127
You got to break rule number two.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.192
- Chewie, prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.
- Yes!

40:25.269 --> 40:28.033
Okay, I'm ready.

40:30.374 --> 40:32.774
Somebody tell me
what the goddamn red button's for!

40:32.844 --> 40:35.369
It's light speed, kid.

40:35.446 --> 40:37.573
- Light speed?
- Yeah.

40:37.648 --> 40:39.775
Punch it!

40:39.851 --> 40:42.376
<i>What the- Come on!</i>

40:42.453 --> 40:45.820
- You're not gonna do this to me now.
- No. Okay, I'm resetting.

40:45.890 --> 40:47.790
<i>Light speed. Impressive.</i>

40:47.859 --> 40:49.827
I put a tank of nitrous in this thing.
It's not firing.

40:49.894 --> 40:52.454
- Hutch, please do something.
- Hutch!

40:52.530 --> 40:56.557
Damn it.

41:00.538 --> 41:02.005
Whoo!

41:02.073 --> 41:03.802
Oh, my God!

41:04.809 --> 41:06.936
It's working!
Whoo!

41:09.013 --> 41:12.312
<i>- Stay on target! Stay on target!
- Oh, Godl</i>

41:12.383 --> 41:13.941
Oh, shit!

41:27.632 --> 41:30.192
I probably shouldn't
have called that cop a fag.

41:30.268 --> 41:33.362
I think he took it the wrong way.

41:33.437 --> 41:36.099
Breakfast.

41:36.174 --> 41:38.699
- Oh, God.
- Ow!

41:38.776 --> 41:41.210
<i>- Jesus!
- Oh, God.</i>

41:42.680 --> 41:44.204
Ham and cheese.

41:46.818 --> 41:51.050
Well, look on the bright side, you guys.
This trip can't get any worse.

41:52.657 --> 41:54.284
It just did, boys.

41:55.526 --> 41:57.994
- What?
- I got to drop a sewer pickle.

41:58.062 --> 42:01.293
Yeah, I got to throw her into reverse.

42:01.365 --> 42:03.731
Bottler, give me your sandwich, bro.

42:05.236 --> 42:07.227
Hook me up.
Another one.

42:07.305 --> 42:09.330
- What's the sandwich for?
- I don't know.

42:09.407 --> 42:12.570
I'm not gonna sit on this.

42:12.643 --> 42:14.543
- Oh, Hutch!
- Jesus.

42:14.612 --> 42:17.581
It's crawling with criminal ass germs.

42:17.648 --> 42:20.583
<i>- Just hover, man.
- Okay, listen up, pre-pubes.</i>

42:20.651 --> 42:24.587
<i>You got a v/s/tor-
Sweet can of corn.</i>

42:24.655 --> 42:28.489
What are you doing with that ham sandwich,
boy? It's not right what you're doing.

42:28.559 --> 42:30.993
<i>Hutch, you owe me a sock.</i>

42:31.062 --> 42:34.054
<i>I had to w/pe w/th someth/ng.</i>

42:34.131 --> 42:38.067
You pussies owe me, big time.

42:38.135 --> 42:41.730
- Oh, Zoe, thank God.
- We weren't sure if you'd gotten our message.

42:41.806 --> 42:46.266
If by message you mean Windows shrieking
into my answering machine like a little girl...

42:46.344 --> 42:48.835
<i>- then yes, message received.
- You don't know what we've been through.</i>

42:48.913 --> 42:51.609
Hutch just took a dump in front of us.

42:51.682 --> 42:54.913
Yeah. That's life inside the big house.

42:54.986 --> 42:57.386
<i>Zoe, prom/se me you brought the money.</i>

42:57.455 --> 42:59.446
I cleared out every cent
Windows had in the comic store.

42:59.523 --> 43:02.117
- You what?
- Oh! Don't even speak.

43:02.193 --> 43:05.822
<i>I took two tax/s, an a/rplane
and an all-n/ght bus r/de.</i>

43:05.897 --> 43:09.230
Next to an old man that I am
pretty sure had a full diaper.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.768
Hey, hey, okay.
Okay, visiting time's over.

43:11.836 --> 43:14.862
The judge wants to see y'all
in his private chambers.

43:14.939 --> 43:17.305
Oh, yeah.
Just one more thing.

43:17.375 --> 43:20.401
Whatever you do,
do not make fun of his name.

43:20.478 --> 43:23.504
Let me see if I got this right.

43:23.581 --> 43:25.811
Now, you tried to outrun
an officer of the law...

43:25.883 --> 43:28.716
because you obtained a bag of peyote
from a Mexican Indian chief...

43:28.786 --> 43:33.553
<i>who thought /t would help
treat your fr/end's term/nal /llness?</i>

43:33.624 --> 43:35.785
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

43:35.860 --> 43:39.057
I'm gonna let you boys go.

43:39.130 --> 43:41.758
Not because I believe you.

43:41.832 --> 43:44.733
- Because I believe your father.
- My father?

43:44.802 --> 43:47.566
- Mm-hmm.
- You actually spoke with my dad?

43:47.638 --> 43:49.128
Sure did.

43:49.206 --> 43:51.834
<i>He wanted me to g/ve you th/s message.</i>

43:51.909 --> 43:53.399
Approach the bench.

44:03.821 --> 44:06.346
Have a nice day, son.

44:07.625 --> 44:12.085
<i>Yeah. Man's gone
carbon/te freeze on us.</i>

44:12.163 --> 44:15.098
<i>We got to be /n Vegas
/n less than 24 hours.</i>

44:15.166 --> 44:18.829
All right. I'm gonna go smack
some sense into the boy.

44:18.903 --> 44:20.928
Whoa. Cut him some slack.

44:21.005 --> 44:22.802
Okay.

44:22.873 --> 44:27.071
I just mapped out our route to Vegas
on my Toughbook...

44:27.144 --> 44:30.011
and the closest airport's
about a hundred miles north of here.

44:30.081 --> 44:33.209
So all we got to do
is drop the ol' Zoe off...

44:33.284 --> 44:35.309
and then it's a straight shot
to Sin City.

44:35.386 --> 44:37.820
Ho! Hold on.

44:37.888 --> 44:40.186
You haul my ass
out into the middle of nowhere...

44:40.257 --> 44:42.691
and expect me to just jump
on the first plane back?

44:42.760 --> 44:44.660
<i>Sorry. It's not gonna happen.</i>

44:44.729 --> 44:46.788
Come on. You know this trip is men only.

44:46.864 --> 44:48.491
I tell you what.

44:48.566 --> 44:53.026
I'll get on the plane
if any one of you can take me down.

44:53.104 --> 44:55.436
<i>L/sten, Pr/ncess.</i>

44:55.506 --> 44:58.339
No one wants to see you get hurt.

44:58.409 --> 45:00.400
I'm gonna get Botts.

45:04.382 --> 45:07.249
<i>- Get off of mel
- Oh, my Godl</i>

45:07.318 --> 45:09.445
- Be a man, Hutch.
- Get her off of me!

45:09.520 --> 45:11.579
- Hutch, say "time-out. "
- Don't just stand there!

45:11.655 --> 45:13.680
<i>Shoot herl
Somebody shoot herl</i>

45:13.758 --> 45:17.057
- Help me, for God sake! God help me!
- Gentlemen.

45:17.128 --> 45:19.358
<i>- Get the jaws ofl/fel
- I'm good.</i>

45:19.430 --> 45:22.524
Welcome aboard.

45:24.602 --> 45:27.366
- Now go get Eric.
- Yes, sir!

45:27.438 --> 45:29.804
And be nice.

45:31.542 --> 45:34.375
You're lucky I have a crush on you.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.414
Yo, Botts, you okay?

45:41.252 --> 45:44.449
You know, I could do this-
start a life here.

45:44.522 --> 45:47.491
Clean slate.
Fresh air.

45:47.558 --> 45:50.550
No pressure, no responsibility.

45:50.628 --> 45:53.392
<i>Yeah, /t seems n/ce, man.</i>

45:53.464 --> 45:57.093
In theory it sounds nice.

45:59.904 --> 46:04.671
I bet there's not even like a Blockbuster Video
within 500 miles of here.

46:04.742 --> 46:06.733
Or like a Falafel Hut or-

46:06.811 --> 46:09.575
Guys, shut up.

46:10.848 --> 46:13.976
I just figured if I...

46:14.051 --> 46:17.350
worked hard and...

46:17.421 --> 46:20.151
sold enough cars and impressed my dad
enough times, I'd-

46:21.659 --> 46:25.095
I'd feel something.

46:25.162 --> 46:28.791
You gotta find your Death Star.

46:30.668 --> 46:32.602
Okay, I'll bite.

46:32.670 --> 46:36.162
Greatest deed Luke Skywalker ever did...

46:36.240 --> 46:38.504
was take down the Death Star, right?

46:38.576 --> 46:42.012
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's what everybody needs.</i>

46:42.079 --> 46:45.913
You need that one bad-ass thing...

46:47.985 --> 46:50.749
that lets you live on forever, you know.

46:52.923 --> 46:54.857
Yeah.

46:59.430 --> 47:02.797
<i>Hey, Sp/ce G/rlsl</i>

47:02.867 --> 47:05.734
Are you gonna swap recipes all day?

47:05.803 --> 47:08.135
Vegas awaits, ladies.

47:10.674 --> 47:12.767
- Wow!
- Sweet!

47:16.780 --> 47:21.308
And here's where you learn
how to do Vegas, fanboy style.

47:23.087 --> 47:25.851
<i>- You guys th/nk/ng
what I'm th/nk/ng?</i>

47:25.923 --> 47:29.324
They are everywhere, Giles.

47:31.362 --> 47:33.796
Mama, star people.

47:35.966 --> 47:38.662
This is so gay.

47:38.736 --> 47:41.227
Ow!

47:41.305 --> 47:43.466
Let me get that for you.

47:45.109 --> 47:48.977
You, uh-You might wanna hit the showers.

47:49.046 --> 47:51.913
<i>'Cause you smell like something
shit /n my nose.</i>

47:51.982 --> 47:54.473
<i>- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- Ewl</i>

47:54.552 --> 47:58.511
What in God's name is living on your chest?
It looks like you fell on ALF.

48:00.824 --> 48:03.554
<i>- Godl
- Look who's back in uniform.</i>

48:03.627 --> 48:07.563
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's almost 8:00, so we gotta go meet Harry's contact.

48:07.631 --> 48:09.792
Then let's go.

48:09.867 --> 48:12.097
<i>- You guys com/ng?
- I'll catch up with you guys later.</i>

48:12.169 --> 48:15.605
I'm just gonna do a bit
of pillagin' the tables first.

48:17.741 --> 48:19.675
- Twenty-two. Loser.
- Ah, Jesus!

48:19.743 --> 48:22.507
That is mathematically impossible.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.707
I must have the worst luck
in the northern hemisphere.

48:24.782 --> 48:26.773
I heard about the Rogue Leader debacle.

48:26.850 --> 48:28.909
<i>- That's one for the record books.
- Hey.</i>

48:28.986 --> 48:33.355
A cross between Sarah Michelle Gellar
and Janeane Garofalo, it's too good to be true.

48:33.424 --> 48:36.552
I just have to face the facts, Zoe.
I'm 24 years old...

48:36.627 --> 48:39.255
and I've only ever copulated
with one woman.

48:39.330 --> 48:41.594
Plenty of guys have
only been with one woman.

48:41.665 --> 48:44.725
I don't know that many women
to have only been with one woman.

48:44.802 --> 48:48.795
<i>I, uh-
I'm female krypton/te.</i>

48:49.840 --> 48:52.104
Look, you're fine around me.

48:52.176 --> 48:56.237
Well, yeah, of course I am.
That's 'cause...

48:56.313 --> 48:58.645
you are not a girl.

48:58.716 --> 49:01.150
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

49:01.218 --> 49:03.209
No. Please enlighten me.

49:03.287 --> 49:06.552
<i>You know every Bond villain,
you constantly quote Clash of the T/tans.</i>

49:06.624 --> 49:09.422
<i>And you've beat every Zelda game
N/ntendo's ever released.</i>

49:09.493 --> 49:13.429
<i>- I mean-
- Dude, dude, dude. Three o'clock, man.</i>

49:13.497 --> 49:16.728
Hotties on the slotties.

49:33.717 --> 49:36.880
I would knock the nickels
out of that pussy!

49:36.954 --> 49:40.321
Dude, you're gonna be my Dak today,
all right? Follow my lead.

49:40.391 --> 49:45.488
- Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. You wanna just talk to them?
- Yeah. It's called having balls.

49:45.562 --> 49:48.998
Or in your case, one ball.
Come on. Eric and Linus are waiting.

49:49.066 --> 49:51.899
What are you, the wife?
Let's go.

49:51.969 --> 49:55.097
- Wait. You're going over there?
- Uh-

49:55.172 --> 49:58.164
Turns out you're more
clueless than you think.

49:58.242 --> 50:00.767
- Apparently, so am I.
- What does that mean? Zoe!

50:00.844 --> 50:03.711
<i>- Zoel
- Come on.</i>

50:03.781 --> 50:06.443
- Pardon me.
- Hi there.

50:06.517 --> 50:08.610
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.

50:08.686 --> 50:12.178
- Hi.
- Ladies.

50:12.256 --> 50:16.124
<i>You lad/es look/ng for love /n Alderaan places?</i>

50:16.193 --> 50:20.323
- Excuse me? - Alderaan is the last
planet destroyed by the Death Star-

50:20.397 --> 50:23.230
Bomba, bomba, bomba!
Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat! Daniel-san.

50:23.300 --> 50:27.066
<i>What my soc/ally retarded fr/end
was try/ng to say.</i>

50:27.137 --> 50:30.038
Was that we'd like to
maybe buy you two gals a beverage.

50:30.107 --> 50:32.302
- Sure.
- Sure.

50:32.376 --> 50:35.311
Oh, my God. Wow.

50:35.379 --> 50:38.507
You know, uh, Eric and Linus
are waiting for us.

50:38.582 --> 50:41.745
I think that they're going to understand.

50:41.819 --> 50:44.947
They're going to understand.

50:45.022 --> 50:48.355
Where are they, man?
It's almost- It's almost 8:00!

50:48.425 --> 50:51.861
I don't know where they are, but we
don't have time to wait for 'em. Come on.

50:51.929 --> 50:54.193
Convention room's this way.
Let's go.

51:00.904 --> 51:02.963
<i>- Rak nonl
- Yes, sir!</i>

51:03.040 --> 51:05.270
Phasers on stun.

51:05.342 --> 51:08.402
Being the C.E.O.
Of my own company...

51:08.479 --> 51:10.447
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I get a lot of perks.

51:10.514 --> 51:12.812
I got a big-ass mansion, you know.

51:12.883 --> 51:15.545
I got a butler-
Maurice.

51:15.619 --> 51:20.488
Bentley in the drive.
Flux capacitor.

51:20.557 --> 51:24.721
I mean, the 1.21 gigawatts,
that don't come cheap, you know.

51:24.795 --> 51:27.764
- But I got the duckets, you know.
- Wow.

51:27.831 --> 51:30.698
There's nothing more sexy
than a man with power.

51:30.768 --> 51:33.100
What do you mean?
Like-You like power?

51:33.170 --> 51:35.104
- Uh-huh.
- I like power.

51:35.172 --> 51:37.197
- I got a hell of a lot of power.
- Yeah?

51:37.274 --> 51:39.265
Yeah.

51:44.481 --> 51:46.949
You want to come sit on my lap.

51:49.853 --> 51:51.946
Oh. Wow.

51:53.624 --> 51:57.060
You want to take your shirt off.

52:00.197 --> 52:02.062
Wow-ar-r-rm.

52:03.167 --> 52:05.158
Yummy!

52:18.715 --> 52:22.981
Oh, my God.

52:23.053 --> 52:24.782
<i>- Can you smell that?
- Trekk/es.</i>

52:24.855 --> 52:28.518
<i>Yeah.</i>

52:30.494 --> 52:34.430
Badges.

52:34.498 --> 52:37.831
<i>Yeah, we're not here for the Trek.</i>

52:37.901 --> 52:40.461
Okay? We're here to see somebody.

52:40.537 --> 52:43.973
And who would that be?

52:45.642 --> 52:47.803
We're here to see the nerfherder.

52:49.046 --> 52:53.142
- Hmm?
- Scruffy Nerfherder.

52:55.219 --> 52:57.244
Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop!

52:57.321 --> 52:59.846
And then Zoe just storms off.

52:59.923 --> 53:01.948
I mean, she's really...

53:02.025 --> 53:05.825
a very difficult specimen
to read sometimes.

53:05.896 --> 53:08.387
If you know what I mean.
But I-

53:08.465 --> 53:11.559
You just can't act like that
if you wanna be one of the guys.

53:13.337 --> 53:16.829
Maybe... she doesn't
wanna be one of the guys.

53:18.575 --> 53:20.475
She likes you.

53:23.046 --> 53:26.277
But I didn't-
But she kind of just-

53:28.252 --> 53:30.482
Jesus Murphy!

53:30.554 --> 53:32.852
Wow. Okay.

53:32.923 --> 53:35.084
What-What should I do?

53:35.158 --> 53:38.992
<i>Well, /f there's one th/ng
I learned be/ng an escort.</i>

53:39.062 --> 53:42.190
It's that actions speak louder than words.

53:42.266 --> 53:44.257
Did you just say "escort"?

53:49.873 --> 53:52.137
Fantastic.

53:52.209 --> 53:54.871
<i>Shh!</i>

53:56.179 --> 53:58.545

- Yeah.

53:58.615 --> 54:01.175
<i>You're latel</i>

54:05.088 --> 54:07.579

54:07.658 --> 54:12.527
<i>phony I.D.'s to get you past the front gates,
but that's not what's most important.</i>

54:12.596 --> 54:14.621
What's most important?

54:19.136 --> 54:21.934
We never met.

54:22.005 --> 54:23.939
- That's Capt-
- Yeah. I think-

54:25.642 --> 54:29.305

I can't believe that these are classified.

54:29.379 --> 54:32.576

Look at the maps. I mean, there's badges.

- Thank you.

54:42.159 --> 54:47.392
Are you kidding?
I'm William Shatner. I can score anything.

54:47.464 --> 54:50.331

Wait, wait.

54:59.409 --> 55:01.468
Okay, let me go.

55:04.982 --> 55:07.007
<i>What are you do/ng, man?

55:07.084 --> 55:09.177
It's not a good time.
The Force is strong with me here.

55:09.252 --> 55:12.688
<i>- Actually, your hour's over.

55:12.756 --> 55:16.692
- Hutch, they're hookers.
- We're not hookers. We're escorts.

55:16.760 --> 55:18.751

55:29.406 --> 55:31.840
- One thousand.

55:31.908 --> 55:34.376
<i>- Mm-hmm.

55:34.444 --> 55:36.173
- Give me a refund.
- Is that possible?

55:36.246 --> 55:39.340
<i>You know what? We're male

55:39.416 --> 55:41.941

You called Han Solo a bitch, man!

58:25.015 --> 58:28.314
Han Solo is a bitch.

Linus tells me that
you're on some sort of a road trip.

<i>- Uh, he-

Guys, we can't-we can't do this now.
We can't give up now.

01:00:22.365 --> 01:00:25.061
Not when we're so close.

<i>L/nus, /t's just a mov/e.</i>

Maybe it is. You know what?

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.812
<i>To most people, Star Wars
is just a movie, right?</i>

01:00:42.886 --> 01:00:45.184
- Not to us!
- We just spoke to the doctor.

01:00:45.255 --> 01:00:48.418
Screw that doctor!
Screw- Screw all those people!

01:00:48.491 --> 01:00:52.894

<i>Who knows?
Yes, they could have.</i>

01:01:05.008 --> 01:01:06.976
- But you know who did?
- Me.

01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:09.375
Yes, you did.
So did I. So did you.

01:01:09.446 --> 01:01:12.313

- Hutch?
- Yeah?

01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:36.944
Your ass still smells like ham and cheese.

01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:43.785
Sweet. That way.

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:50.616
Wow.

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:04.065
Shatner, don't fail us now, right?

01:06:05.675 --> 01:06:08.109
Whoa.

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:10.077
Yeah!

01:06:19.355 --> 01:06:21.755
<i>- Oh, my God.
- No way.</i>

01:06:25.094 --> 01:06:27.528
We're home, boys.

01:06:27.597 --> 01:06:29.531
See, that's what I call a collection.

01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:32.397
This is where I want my ashes scattered.

01:06:41.544 --> 01:06:44.604
Oh!

01:06:47.116 --> 01:06:50.176
- " Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope. "

01:06:50.253 --> 01:06:53.689
They've got Indy stuff.

01:06:53.756 --> 01:06:55.986
Thermal detonator.

01:06:56.059 --> 01:06:58.289
I think I'm gonna cry.

01:06:58.361 --> 01:07:03.526
Hey. They got Willow's spell book!

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:05.897
You know, Willow?
Little guy?

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:09.836
<i>Mag/cal-
"Ka/ya. "</i>

01:07:09.906 --> 01:07:11.533
Who cares about Willow?

01:07:11.607 --> 01:07:15.737
Look at this.

01:07:15.812 --> 01:07:18.713
<i>"Throw me the /dol. "</i>

01:07:19.782 --> 01:07:22.751
<i>Guys, look at th/s.
"We've got bad dates. "</i>

01:07:22.819 --> 01:07:27.552
One kaddam for the Hebrew god.

01:07:27.623 --> 01:07:30.558
We have a breach in the archive room.
Breach in the archive room.

01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:44.230
You know, no matter
how you felt about the guy...

01:07:46.509 --> 01:07:48.477
Vader embraced his fate.

01:07:48.544 --> 01:07:50.774
He faced death head-on.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.442
<i>No one moves.</i>

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.183
<i>Subjects have been located.
Request/ng backup.</i>

01:08:01.257 --> 01:08:03.919
Please step away from Lord Vader.

01:08:03.993 --> 01:08:06.518
Dude, what's up with the outfits?

01:08:06.596 --> 01:08:08.962
Company policy.

01:08:09.031 --> 01:08:11.431
You wanna work here,
you gotta wear the suit.

01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:14.959
Carl, you make us wear the suit.

01:08:15.037 --> 01:08:18.473
- Run? -
Run. - Run.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:21.635
- Zoe!
- Just go!

01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:24.874
<i>- I'm not leaving without her.
- What, are you crazy? It's three aga/nst onel</i>

01:08:24.947 --> 01:08:27.245
Never tell me the odds.

01:08:27.316 --> 01:08:30.979
There can be only one.

01:08:34.857 --> 01:08:37.758
Time for you to get mauled, boy.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.725
I'm good.

01:08:47.804 --> 01:08:50.328
- Go!
- Let's go!

01:08:50.406 --> 01:08:52.135
<i>Man downl Man downl</i>

01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:00.814
Stop! Don't move!

01:09:00.883 --> 01:09:02.817
Run!

01:09:02.885 --> 01:09:05.718
Subjects are fleeing to the west corridor!

01:09:05.787 --> 01:09:08.586
- Go, go, go!
- Stop!

01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:10.421
Go, go!

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:13.758
Come on!

01:09:16.765 --> 01:09:21.600
<i>Hmm. Yoda says go/ng up you are.</i>

01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:33.982
- In!
- Get in! Get your ass in there!

01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:37.144
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.381
Move it! Over there!

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:43.015
Over there! Let's go!

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:47.618
That was awesome!

01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:51.595
<i>Where the hell are we?</i>

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.862
I have a bad feeling about this.

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:57.064
Um, you guys don't think that the, um-

01:09:57.139 --> 01:09:59.164
We are in George Lucas's trash room.

01:09:59.242 --> 01:10:03.042
Don't be ridiculous, okay?
The walls are not gonna close in on us.

01:10:05.882 --> 01:10:09.978
<i>- Holy-
- Jesusl</i>

01:10:12.388 --> 01:10:14.481
- Let's fortify the walls with this.
- Do it!

01:10:14.557 --> 01:10:17.390
- Um, girls?
- Goddamn you, walls!

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.223
Girls!

01:10:19.295 --> 01:10:21.593
That'd be the air duct.

01:10:22.899 --> 01:10:25.595
- And that there's the exit.
- Yeah, the exit.

01:10:25.668 --> 01:10:28.603
- And you guys are the big pussies.
- I knew.

01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:31.731
"3PO!
We're all right!"

01:10:35.378 --> 01:10:39.371
Guys, this way!

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:42.508
- Yikes!
- Check in here.

01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:44.576
<i>Th/s one's clear.</i>

01:10:53.496 --> 01:10:56.431
Damn it, shut up!

01:10:59.402 --> 01:11:01.768
I think we lost 'em, right?

01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:09.337
Yeah, we lost them for now, but we
cannot run around this place all night.

01:11:12.615 --> 01:11:14.640
Guys!

01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:17.949
<i>We're /n the motherboard.
We're /n.</i>

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:21.478

01:11:21.557 --> 01:11:24.993
<i>Holy sh/t. Oh, wow.
We're- We're-</i>

01:11:25.061 --> 01:11:27.359
<i>- Oh, my God.

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:30.297
You guys need to see this.
You guys need to see this. Look.

01:11:32.702 --> 01:11:35.398
<i>Holy Hothl</i>

01:11:35.471 --> 01:11:38.929
- I think this is it. I think this is it.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:39.008 --> 01:11:41.602
Play it. Play it.

01:11:41.677 --> 01:11:44.908
Hey, get over here.
Come on.

01:11:48.684 --> 01:11:50.982

- The crawl!

01:11:51.053 --> 01:11:53.681
<i>The crawll</i>

01:11:53.756 --> 01:11:57.157

01:12:02.231 --> 01:12:03.994
Come on! Come on!

01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:11.969
- Here you are.
- Yeah.

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.845
That hooker in Vegas gave me something.

01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:19.847
What?

01:12:19.915 --> 01:12:22.110
The truth.

01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:25.585
I'm in love with you and, uh-

01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:27.885
I love you too.

01:12:27.957 --> 01:12:30.858
<i>Stand back.</i>

01:12:41.037 --> 01:12:43.904
- Okay, on your feet!
- Us?

01:12:43.973 --> 01:12:47.841
- Yeah! Come on up! On your feet!
- Get on outta here! Come on!

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.140
<i>Nowl Get on your feetl</i>

01:12:50.212 --> 01:12:52.407
Yeah, get on your feet!
Who the hell are these people?

01:12:52.481 --> 01:12:54.915
<i>- And I/ne up aga/nst the wall, all of youl
- Back against the wall!</i>

01:12:54.984 --> 01:12:58.351
Get up! What are you talkin' about? Hey!

01:12:58.421 --> 01:13:02.016
<i>Step away from the Millennium Falcon
and I/ne up aga/nst the wall.</i>

01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:05.723
- Now!
- Oh.

01:13:05.795 --> 01:13:08.263
- Oh, God.
- Linus, what are you doing, man?

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:11.026
I'm feeling crazy right now.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.069
- Dude, do you have any idea how valuable that thing is?
- Not a good idea.

01:13:14.136 --> 01:13:16.570
<i>Put /t down. Come on.
Put /t down nowl</i>

01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:21.167
You guys stand up against the wall,
or I will smash this thing into a billion pieces!

01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:25.103
<i>I w/ll.
I w/ll smash th/sl</i>

01:13:25.181 --> 01:13:27.911
- No.
- What, you think I won't?

01:13:27.983 --> 01:13:30.679
- No, I don't.
- No, you don't, you think that I won't...

01:13:30.753 --> 01:13:32.721
or, no, you don't, you think that I will?

01:13:32.788 --> 01:13:36.121
- The first one.
- I'm confused. Who's doing what now?

01:13:36.192 --> 01:13:38.217
- You tell me.
- It doesn't matter.

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:41.730
<i>Because if he puts down the M/llenn/um
Falcon, I will smash this training remote...</i>

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:43.287
<i>eras/ng /t from h/story.</i>

01:13:43.365 --> 01:13:45.925
- Come on, guys. Let's rethink this.
- Shut up, Windows!

01:13:46.001 --> 01:13:48.765
<i>- Who's doing what?
- Put down the M/llenn/um Falcon and the training remote...</i>

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:50.772
<i>or I w/ll destroy th/s puppet.</i>

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.434
- Craig! You can't!
- Shut up, Barry.

01:13:53.509 --> 01:13:56.034
- Put down Master Yoda!
- You put yours down, damn it!

01:13:56.112 --> 01:13:59.639
I can't do it!

01:13:59.715 --> 01:14:01.876
- All right, everybody shut up!
- Oh!

01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:05.751
Swear to God, this little ewok
is going up in flames! I'll do it.

01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:08.483
- Do it. Go ahead. Burn it.
- I will.

01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:10.422
- Yeah, burn it.
- Guys, nobody wants this.

01:14:10.493 --> 01:14:12.552
- I will.
- Burn it. Burn it.

01:14:12.628 --> 01:14:14.994
- I'm gonna. That's what I said!
- Burn it!

01:14:15.064 --> 01:14:18.056
<i>Good. I was always more of
a Star Trek fan anyway.</i>

01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:21.297
Damn Trekkies are everywhere!

01:14:23.839 --> 01:14:27.138
<i>All right, we'll take it from here.
Sir, give me the Falcon.</i>

01:14:29.411 --> 01:14:32.244
- I can't believe I let you guys get me into this.
- Shut up!

01:14:37.386 --> 01:14:40.253
How you guys doing?
You guys doing good?

01:14:42.224 --> 01:14:44.158
So let me get this right.

01:14:44.226 --> 01:14:48.253
You guys wanted to see
our movie early for free.

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:51.493
So you broke into private property, huh?

01:14:51.567 --> 01:14:53.694
- And you tried to steal it.
- L-I-

01:14:53.769 --> 01:14:55.794
I haven't even seen the movie yet!

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:57.771
Sir, I understand that this looks bad-

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.276
It looks like three-to-five-years, locked-up,
for-breaking-and-entering bad.

01:15:01.343 --> 01:15:04.312
That's right, sweet cheeks.
By the time y'all walk away from this...

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.008
your faces are gonna be
shrunken and shriveled...

01:15:07.082 --> 01:15:09.482
just like your one nut.

01:15:09.552 --> 01:15:13.454
What? How can he possibly know that?

01:15:13.522 --> 01:15:15.456
Oh, we know about your uniball.

01:15:15.524 --> 01:15:20.325
We know everything,
Mr. Harold Hutchinson, a. k.a. Hutch.

01:15:20.396 --> 01:15:24.196
Son of Gloria.
Humongous Rush fan.

01:15:24.266 --> 01:15:26.461
Dude, you're freaking me out.
How do you know this?

01:15:26.535 --> 01:15:28.560
Because you have a Rush shirt on, dipshit.

01:15:28.637 --> 01:15:33.802
And because we have
a dossier on every single one of you.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.639
No one move!

01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:38.976
Get your hands off the glass table.

01:15:39.048 --> 01:15:41.812
Hello, Mr. Lucas.

01:15:41.884 --> 01:15:43.909
Shut up!
Shut your mouths.

01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:47.046
- Yes.
- I can hear his beard.

01:15:47.122 --> 01:15:50.683
Yes. Shut up. Mm-hmm.

01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:54.490
I don't wanna say that it was a hole in my
security, but- How did you guys break in?

01:15:54.563 --> 01:15:56.656
- I used a grappling hook-
- And we climbed-

01:15:56.732 --> 01:15:59.530
- Was William Shatner involved with this?
- No. Not at all.

01:15:59.602 --> 01:16:03.368
<i>They sa/d no.
No. No one was hurt. Not yet.</i>

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.498
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:16:05.574 --> 01:16:07.769
Okay. Very well.

01:16:11.313 --> 01:16:16.376
Damn it. I've just been told
that what I said earlier I no longer believe.

01:16:16.452 --> 01:16:18.352
Hmm?

01:16:21.323 --> 01:16:24.656
Mr. Lucas is touched and mildly flattered
by what you have done here.

01:16:24.727 --> 01:16:27.525
And I have been informed
that I feel the same way.

01:16:27.596 --> 01:16:31.794
So the charges are gonna be dropped.

01:16:31.867 --> 01:16:34.961
That is, of course, if you are...

01:16:35.037 --> 01:16:37.562
what you appear to be.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.870
Uh, what do we appear to be?

01:16:39.942 --> 01:16:44.845
Fanboys. Something we can easily
determine with a simple quiz.

01:16:51.053 --> 01:16:53.578
What is the name of the planet
that Leia gave Grand MoffTarkin...

01:16:53.656 --> 01:16:56.056
<i>as the false location of the rebel base
in Ep/sode IV?</i>

01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:59.617
- Dantooine.
- What is the name of the gunner in Luke's snow speeder?

01:16:59.695 --> 01:17:03.324
- Dak.
- Where is a woman's g-spot located?

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:08.800
- What?
- If you were to ask a woman to perform a Mississippi handbag...

01:17:08.871 --> 01:17:11.499
where would your testicles end up?

01:17:11.573 --> 01:17:14.337
<i>That's not a Star Wars question.</i>

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:17.846
I didn't say the nipples.
I said the little bumps around the nipples.

01:17:17.913 --> 01:17:20.279
Yar-Arr-

01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:22.476
<i>That is not a Louisiana pile driver.</i>

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:26.612
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you? Hmph. Virgin.

01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:28.748
Virgin.

01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:31.190
Areola borealis?

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.093
Near the-the, um, bumps?

01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:38.557
That's what you do.
You aim for the eye, grab the lip...

01:17:38.634 --> 01:17:40.431
lead her around the room-
blinding the marlin.

01:17:40.502 --> 01:17:43.130
God, you're sexy and well-versed.
I like it.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.605
Okay. Guards!

01:17:46.675 --> 01:17:49.109
- Okay, that's it.
- That's what happens. Okay, I got it. All right.

01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:51.112
- I'm good.
- Bye-bye.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:56.015
Congratulations.
Mr. Lucas has decided to drop the charges.

01:17:58.721 --> 01:18:00.951
So, what?
We're free to go, right?

01:18:01.023 --> 01:18:04.288
Well, not exactly.
He says you can watch the film.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.727
What?
We can watch the movie?

01:18:09.865 --> 01:18:12.026
Hold it. Hold it.
Only you.

01:18:17.039 --> 01:18:19.234
It's good, man.
It's right.

01:18:24.646 --> 01:18:28.480
<i>Hey, are you lonely</i>

01:18:29.818 --> 01:18:34.187
<i>Has summer gone so slowly</i>

01:18:34.256 --> 01:18:38.420
<i>We found the ground</i>

01:18:38.494 --> 01:18:42.760
<i>And that damage was done</i>

01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:46.597
<i>It's cold
as you fade /nto the sun</i>

01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:51.400
<i>Where'd you go</i>

01:18:53.642 --> 01:18:56.907
<i>To me</i>

01:19:04.586 --> 01:19:06.816
<i>But you're al/ve</i>

01:19:06.889 --> 01:19:08.914
<i>Well, /t's only</i>

01:19:10.426 --> 01:19:14.624
<i>Fallen frames
they told me</i>

01:19:14.696 --> 01:19:18.188
<i>You stand out</i>

01:19:18.267 --> 01:19:21.395
<i>It's so loud
and so what /f /t /s</i>

01:19:23.338 --> 01:19:27.707
<i>It's cold as you face
/nto the w/nd</i>

01:19:27.776 --> 01:19:29.710
Chewie.

01:19:32.147 --> 01:19:36.311
<i>Ton/ght the sun

01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:41.482
<i>So what /f you catch me
Where would we land</i>

01:19:41.557 --> 01:19:47.052
<i>In somebody's I/fe

01:19:47.129 --> 01:19:52.362
<i>S/ng to me hope

01:19:52.434 --> 01:19:57.895
<i>All of our work

01:19:59.074 --> 01:20:01.008
<i>Where to go</i>

01:20:09.384 --> 01:20:12.751
- That's not bad.
- Thanks, man.

01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:27.496
There's something I need to-
I should...

01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:29.594
probably tell you before, uh-

01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:32.799
Before I'm gone.

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:36.038
You could say it.
I won't hold it against you.

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:41.547
I just- I wish I could...

01:20:43.785 --> 01:20:46.948
<i>change these last three years, you know.</i>

01:20:48.423 --> 01:20:51.722
You know, I wouldn't want you to.

01:20:51.793 --> 01:20:54.284
You gotta keep the flaws.

01:20:54.363 --> 01:20:56.558
Crappy effects.

01:20:56.632 --> 01:20:58.600
Real puppets.

01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:01.329
That's what makes it so good, you know?

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.371
Yeah.

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:07.033
<i>Th/s was never about the mov/e.</i>

01:21:07.109 --> 01:21:11.671
You know, this was, uh-
this was about all of us.

01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:15.609
Hey.

01:21:18.253 --> 01:21:21.984
Look at us.
We're together again, freezing our nuts off.

01:21:22.057 --> 01:21:24.321
<i>No team/ng upl That's a rulel</i>

01:21:24.393 --> 01:21:26.588
You're such dicks!

01:21:26.662 --> 01:21:29.426
- Both of you are dicks!
- I'm gonna go save him.

01:21:29.498 --> 01:21:31.693
- Please.
- You coming?

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:34.531
No, I'm good right here.

01:21:35.604 --> 01:21:37.595
All right, man.

01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:48.439
I'm good right here.

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:07.230
Guys, it's time.

01:22:09.104 --> 01:22:13.063
That better be your lucky R2 poking me.

01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:15.871
Nope. My penis.

01:22:18.547 --> 01:22:20.481
You guys are gross.

01:22:41.103 --> 01:22:43.594
Any, uh-
Any sign of Hutch?

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.311
- Talk to me.
- It's me. Where the hell are you?

01:22:53.382 --> 01:22:55.816
I'm just finishing up
at the garage here, man.

01:22:55.884 --> 01:22:59.513
- Shake a leg, ya bastard. We're saving your place.
- All right.

01:23:09.765 --> 01:23:12.029
Okay!

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.002
Yes! That's awesome.
That's awesome.

01:23:16.071 --> 01:23:18.767
- Hey!
- Hey! Oh, my God!

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.774
Right at the buzzer.

01:23:20.842 --> 01:23:22.673
Yeah!

01:23:24.613 --> 01:23:27.639
Excuse me.
Are you Eric Bottler?

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:29.115
Yeah.

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:34.852
- We just got your new comic.
- Whoa.

01:23:34.923 --> 01:23:37.289
- Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.
- I don't.

01:23:37.359 --> 01:23:39.384
I think it's quite shoddy.

01:23:39.461 --> 01:23:43.056
- Worst series ever.
- Total Lucas rip-off!

01:23:43.131 --> 01:23:46.532
<i>- The artwork /s neophyte.
- At best.</i>

01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:49.365
- What's up, my nerds?
- Ah.

01:23:49.438 --> 01:23:53.135
Why don't you ask the man for an autograph?
Ask the man for an autograph!

01:23:54.876 --> 01:23:57.310
Do it!

01:23:57.379 --> 01:24:00.837
"You are a douche bag.

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:03.908
Love, Eric Bottler. "
Here you go.

01:24:03.985 --> 01:24:08.217
All right, let's move it,
Boba Fags. End of the line.

01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:11.225
- Move it! Let's go!
- Chaz, what the hell are you doing here, man?

01:24:11.293 --> 01:24:13.727
<i>Ah, come on, bro.
It's the Wars.</i>

01:24:13.795 --> 01:24:16.764
I love that about you.

01:24:16.832 --> 01:24:20.359
Look at you, C-3Penis Face.
How'd you pull that trim?

01:24:28.443 --> 01:24:30.172
- Doctor.
- Oh!

01:24:30.245 --> 01:24:32.179
- Smart man.
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:32.247 --> 01:24:33.942
<i>They're good. There you go.</i>

01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:37.416
- Hey, you guys. To Linus.
- Yeah, to Linus.

01:24:53.034 --> 01:24:55.901
- Hey, you guys.
- What, man?

01:24:55.971 --> 01:24:58.769
What if the movie sucks?
